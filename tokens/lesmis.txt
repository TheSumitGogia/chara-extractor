PREFACE

*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
there
shall
exist
,
by
virtue
of
law
and
custom
,
decrees
of
*NL*
damnation
pronounced
by
society
,
artificially
creating
hells
amid
the
*NL*
civilization
of
earth
,
and
adding
the
element
of
human
fate
to
divine
*NL*
destiny
;
so
long
as
the
three
great
problems
of
the
century
--
the
*NL*
degradation
of
man
through
pauperism
,
the
corruption
of
woman
through
*NL*
hunger
,
the
crippling
of
children
through
lack
of
light
--
are
unsolved
;
*NL*
so
long
as
social
asphyxia
is
possible
in
any
part
of
the
world
;
--
in
*NL*
other
words
,
and
with
a
still
wider
significance
,
so
long
as
ignorance
*NL*
and
poverty
exist
on
earth
,
books
of
the
nature
of
Les
Miserables
can
not
*NL*
fail
to
be
of
use

CHAPTER
I
--
M.
MYRIEL
*NL*
*NL*
In
1815
,
M.
Charles-Francois-Bienvenu
Myriel
was
Bishop
of
D
--
He
was
*NL*
an
old
man
of
about
seventy-five
years
of
age
;
he
had
occupied
the
see
*NL*
of
D
--
since
1806
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
this
detail
has
no
connection
whatever
with
the
real
substance
*NL*
of
what
we
are
about
to
relate
,
it
will
not
be
superfluous
,
if
merely
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
exactness
in
all
points
,
to
mention
here
the
various
*NL*
rumors
and
remarks
which
had
been
in
circulation
about
him
from
the
very
*NL*
moment
when
he
arrived
in
the
diocese
.
True
or
false
,
that
which
is
said
*NL*
of
men
often
occupies
as
important
a
place
in
their
lives
,
and
above
all
*NL*
in
their
destinies
,
as
that
which
they
do
.
M.
Myriel
was
the
son
of
a
*NL*
councillor
of
the
Parliament
of
Aix
;
hence
he
belonged
to
the
nobility
*NL*
of
the
bar
.
It
was
said
that
his
father
,
destining
him
to
be
the
heir
of
*NL*
his
own
post
,
had
married
him
at
a
very
early
age
,
eighteen
or
twenty
,
*NL*
in
accordance
with
a
custom
which
is
rather
widely
prevalent
in
*NL*
parliamentary
families
.
In
spite
of
this
marriage
,
however
,
it
was
said
*NL*
that
Charles
Myriel
created
a
great
deal
of
talk
.
He
was
well
formed
,
*NL*
though
rather
short
in
stature
,
elegant
,
graceful
,
intelligent
;
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
first
portion
of
his
life
had
been
devoted
to
the
world
and
*NL*
to
gallantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Revolution
came
;
events
succeeded
each
other
with
precipitation
;
the
*NL*
parliamentary
families
,
decimated
,
pursued
,
hunted
down
,
were
dispersed
.
*NL*
M.
Charles
Myriel
emigrated
to
Italy
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
.
There
his
wife
died
of
a
malady
of
the
chest
,
from
which
she
*NL*
had
long
suffered
.
He
had
no
children
.
What
took
place
next
in
the
fate
*NL*
of
M.
Myriel
?
The
ruin
of
the
French
society
of
the
olden
days
,
the
fall
*NL*
of
his
own
family
,
the
tragic
spectacles
of
'
93
,
which
were
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
even
more
alarming
to
the
emigrants
who
viewed
them
from
a
distance
,
*NL*
with
the
magnifying
powers
of
terror
,
--
did
these
cause
the
ideas
of
*NL*
renunciation
and
solitude
to
germinate
in
him
?
Was
he
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
these
distractions
,
these
affections
which
absorbed
his
life
,
suddenly
*NL*
smitten
with
one
of
those
mysterious
and
terrible
blows
which
sometimes
*NL*
overwhelm
,
by
striking
to
his
heart
,
a
man
whom
public
catastrophes
*NL*
would
not
shake
,
by
striking
at
his
existence
and
his
fortune
?
No
one
*NL*
could
have
told
:
all
that
was
known
was
,
that
when
he
returned
from
*NL*
Italy
he
was
a
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1804
,
M.
Myriel
was
the
Cure
of
B
--
-LSB-
Brignolles
-RSB-
.
He
was
already
*NL*
advanced
in
years
,
and
lived
in
a
very
retired
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
epoch
of
the
coronation
,
some
petty
affair
connected
with
*NL*
his
curacy
--
just
what
,
is
not
precisely
known
--
took
him
to
Paris
.
*NL*
Among
other
powerful
persons
to
whom
he
went
to
solicit
aid
for
his
*NL*
parishioners
was
M.
le
Cardinal
Fesch
.
One
day
,
when
the
Emperor
*NL*
had
come
to
visit
his
uncle
,
the
worthy
Cure
,
who
was
waiting
in
the
*NL*
anteroom
,
found
himself
present
when
His
Majesty
passed
.
Napoleon
,
*NL*
on
finding
himself
observed
with
a
certain
curiosity
by
this
old
man
,
*NL*
turned
round
and
said
abruptly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
good
man
who
is
staring
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
''
said
M.
Myriel
,
``
you
are
looking
at
a
good
man
,
and
I
at
a
great
*NL*
man

That
very
evening
,
the
Emperor
asked
the
Cardinal
the
name
of
the
Cure
,
*NL*
and
some
time
afterwards
M.
Myriel
was
utterly
astonished
to
learn
that
*NL*
he
had
been
appointed
Bishop
of
D
--
*NL*
*NL*
What
truth
was
there
,
after
all
,
in
the
stories
which
were
invented
as
*NL*
to
the
early
portion
of
M.
Myriel
's
life
?
No
one
knew
.
Very
few
families
*NL*
had
been
acquainted
with
the
Myriel
family
before
the
Revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Myriel
had
to
undergo
the
fate
of
every
newcomer
in
a
little
town
,
*NL*
where
there
are
many
mouths
which
talk
,
and
very
few
heads
which
think
.
*NL*
He
was
obliged
to
undergo
it
although
he
was
a
bishop
,
and
because
*NL*
he
was
a
bishop
.
But
after
all
,
the
rumors
with
which
his
name
*NL*
was
connected
were
rumors
only
,
--
noise
,
sayings
,
words
;
less
than
*NL*
words
--
palabres
,
as
the
energetic
language
of
the
South
expresses
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
that
may
be
,
after
nine
years
of
episcopal
power
and
of
*NL*
residence
in
D
--
,
all
the
stories
and
subjects
of
conversation
which
*NL*
engross
petty
towns
and
petty
people
at
the
outset
had
fallen
into
*NL*
profound
oblivion
.
No
one
would
have
dared
to
mention
them
;
no
one
would
*NL*
have
dared
to
recall
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Myriel
had
arrived
at
D
--
accompanied
by
an
elderly
spinster
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
,
who
was
his
sister
,
and
ten
years
his
junior
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
only
domestic
was
a
female
servant
of
the
same
age
as
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
,
and
named
Madame
Magloire
,
who
,
after
having
been
the
*NL*
servant
of
M.
le
Cure
,
now
assumed
the
double
title
of
maid
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
and
housekeeper
to
Monseigneur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
was
a
long
,
pale
,
thin
,
gentle
creature
;
she
*NL*
realized
the
ideal
expressed
by
the
word
``
respectable
''
;
for
it
seems
*NL*
that
a
woman
must
needs
be
a
mother
in
order
to
be
venerable
.
She
*NL*
had
never
been
pretty
;
her
whole
life
,
which
had
been
nothing
but
a
*NL*
succession
of
holy
deeds
,
had
finally
conferred
upon
her
a
sort
of
*NL*
pallor
and
transparency
;
and
as
she
advanced
in
years
she
had
acquired
*NL*
what
may
be
called
the
beauty
of
goodness
.
What
had
been
leanness
in
*NL*
her
youth
had
become
transparency
in
her
maturity
;
and
this
diaphaneity
*NL*
allowed
the
angel
to
be
seen
.
She
was
a
soul
rather
than
a
virgin
.
Her
*NL*
person
seemed
made
of
a
shadow
;
there
was
hardly
sufficient
body
to
*NL*
provide
for
sex
;
a
little
matter
enclosing
a
light
;
large
eyes
forever
*NL*
drooping
;
--
a
mere
pretext
for
a
soul
's
remaining
on
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
was
a
little
,
fat
,
white
old
woman
,
corpulent
and
*NL*
bustling
;
always
out
of
breath
,
--
in
the
first
place
,
because
of
her
*NL*
activity
,
and
in
the
next
,
because
of
her
asthma
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
arrival
,
M.
Myriel
was
installed
in
the
episcopal
palace
with
*NL*
the
honors
required
by
the
Imperial
decrees
,
which
class
a
bishop
*NL*
immediately
after
a
major-general
.
The
mayor
and
the
president
paid
the
*NL*
first
call
on
him
,
and
he
,
in
turn
,
paid
the
first
call
on
the
general
*NL*
and
the
prefect
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
installation
over
,
the
town
waited
to
see
its
bishop
at
work

CHAPTER

--
M.
MYRIEL
BECOMES
M.
WELCOME
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
episcopal
palace
of
D
--
adjoins
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
episcopal
palace
was
a
huge
and
beautiful
house
,
built
of
stone
at
*NL*
the
beginning
of
the
last
century
by
M.
Henri
Puget
,
Doctor
of
Theology
*NL*
of
the
Faculty
of
Paris
,
Abbe
of
Simore
,
who
had
been
Bishop
of
D
--
in
*NL*
1712
.
This
palace
was
a
genuine
seignorial
residence
.
Everything
about
*NL*
it
had
a
grand
air
,
--
the
apartments
of
the
Bishop
,
the
drawing-rooms
,
*NL*
the
chambers
,
the
principal
courtyard
,
which
was
very
large
,
with
walks
*NL*
encircling
it
under
arcades
in
the
old
Florentine
fashion
,
and
gardens
*NL*
planted
with
magnificent
trees
.
In
the
dining-room
,
a
long
and
superb
*NL*
gallery
which
was
situated
on
the
ground-floor
and
opened
on
the
*NL*
gardens
,
M.
Henri
Puget
had
entertained
in
state
,
on
July
29
,
1714
,
My
*NL*
Lords
Charles
Brulart
de
Genlis
,
archbishop
;
Prince
d'Embrun
;
Antoine
*NL*
de
Mesgrigny
,
the
capuchin
,
Bishop
of
Grasse
;
Philippe
de
Vendome
,
Grand
*NL*
Prior
of
France
,
Abbe
of
Saint
Honore
de
Lerins
;
Francois
de
Berton
de
*NL*
Crillon
,
bishop
,
Baron
de
Vence
;
Cesar
de
Sabran
de
Forcalquier
,
bishop
,
*NL*
Seignor
of
Glandeve
;
and
Jean
Soanen
,
Priest
of
the
Oratory
,
preacher
in
*NL*
ordinary
to
the
king
,
bishop
,
Seignor
of
Senez
.
The
portraits
of
these
*NL*
seven
reverend
personages
decorated
this
apartment
;
and
this
memorable
*NL*
date
,
the
29th
of
July
,
1714
,
was
there
engraved
in
letters
of
gold
on
a
*NL*
table
of
white
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hospital
was
a
low
and
narrow
building
of
a
single
story
,
with
a
*NL*
small
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
after
his
arrival
,
the
Bishop
visited
the
hospital
.
The
visit
*NL*
ended
,
he
had
the
director
requested
to
be
so
good
as
to
come
to
his
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
the
director
of
the
hospital
,
''
said
he
to
him
,
``
how
many
sick
*NL*
people
have
you
at
the
present
moment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-six
,
Monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
the
number
which
I
counted
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
beds
,
''
pursued
the
director
,
``
are
very
much
crowded
against
each
*NL*
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
observed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
halls
are
nothing
but
rooms
,
and
it
is
with
difficulty
that
the
air
*NL*
can
be
changed
in
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
seems
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
when
there
is
a
ray
of
sun
,
the
garden
is
very
small
for
the
*NL*
convalescents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
what
I
said
to
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
case
of
epidemics
,
--
we
have
had
the
typhus
fever
this
year
;
we
*NL*
had
the
sweating
sickness
two
years
ago
,
and
a
hundred
patients
at
*NL*
times
,
--
we
know
not
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
thought
which
occurred
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
,
Monseigneur
?
''
said
the
director
.
``
One
must
resign
*NL*
one
's
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
conversation
took
place
in
the
gallery
dining-room
on
the
*NL*
ground-floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
remained
silent
for
a
moment
;
then
he
turned
abruptly
to
the
*NL*
director
of
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
``
how
many
beds
do
you
think
this
hall
alone
would
*NL*
hold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
's
dining-room
?
''
exclaimed
the
stupefied
director
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
cast
a
glance
round
the
apartment
,
and
seemed
to
be
taking
*NL*
measures
and
calculations
with
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
hold
full
twenty
beds
,
''
said
he
,
as
though
speaking
to
*NL*
himself
.
Then
,
raising
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
Monsieur
the
director
of
the
hospital
,
I
will
tell
you
something
.
*NL*
There
is
evidently
a
mistake
here
.
There
are
thirty-six
of
you
,
in
five
*NL*
or
six
small
rooms
.
There
are
three
of
us
here
,
and
we
have
room
for
*NL*
sixty
.
There
is
some
mistake
,
I
tell
you
;
you
have
my
house
,
and
I
have
*NL*
yours
.
Give
me
back
my
house
;
you
are
at
home
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
the
thirty-six
patients
were
installed
in
the
*NL*
Bishop
's
palace
,
and
the
Bishop
was
settled
in
the
hospital
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Myriel
had
no
property
,
his
family
having
been
ruined
by
the
*NL*
Revolution
.
His
sister
was
in
receipt
of
a
yearly
income
of
five
hundred
*NL*
francs
,
which
sufficed
for
her
personal
wants
at
the
vicarage
.
M.
Myriel
*NL*
received
from
the
State
,
in
his
quality
of
bishop
,
a
salary
of
fifteen
*NL*
thousand
francs
.
On
the
very
day
when
he
took
up
his
abode
in
the
*NL*
hospital
,
M.
Myriel
settled
on
the
disposition
of
this
sum
once
for
*NL*
all
,
in
the
following
manner
.
We
transcribe
here
a

*NL*
M.
Myriel
made
no
change
in
this
arrangement
during
the
entire
period
*NL*
that
he
occupied
the
see
of
D
--
As
has
been
seen
,
he
called
it
*NL*
regulating
his
household
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
arrangement
was
accepted
with
absolute
submission
by
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
.
This
holy
woman
regarded
Monseigneur
of
D
--
as
at
one
and
*NL*
the
same
time
her
brother
and
her
bishop
,
her
friend
according
to
the
*NL*
flesh
and
her
superior
according
to
the
Church
.
She
simply
loved
and
*NL*
venerated
him
.
When
he
spoke
,
she
bowed
;
when
he
acted
,
she
yielded
her
*NL*
adherence
.
Their
only
servant
,
Madame
Magloire
,
grumbled
a
little
.
It
*NL*
will
be
observed
that
Monsieur
the
Bishop
had
reserved
for
himself
*NL*
only
one
thousand
livres
,
which
,
added
to
the
pension
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
,
made
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
.
On
these
fifteen
hundred
*NL*
francs
these
two
old
women
and
the
old
man
subsisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
a
village
curate
came
to
D
--
,
the
Bishop
still
found
means
to
*NL*
entertain
him
,
thanks
to
the
severe
economy
of
Madame
Magloire
,
and
to
*NL*
the
intelligent
administration
of
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
after
he
had
been
in
D
--
about
three
months
,
the
Bishop
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
still
I
am
quite
cramped
with
it
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
so
!
''
exclaimed
Madame
Magloire
.
``
Monseigneur
has
not
*NL*
even
claimed
the
allowance
which
the
department
owes
him
for
the
expense
*NL*
of
his
carriage
in
town
,
and
for
his
journeys
about
the
diocese
.
It
was
*NL*
customary
for
bishops
in
former
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
cried
the
Bishop
,
``
you
are
quite
right
,
Madame
Magloire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
made
his
demand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
afterwards
the
General
Council
took
this
demand
under
*NL*
consideration
,
and
voted
him
an
annual
sum
of
three
thousand
francs
,
*NL*
under
this
heading
:
Allowance
to
M.
the
Bishop
for
expenses
of
carriage
,
*NL*
expenses
of
posting
,
and
expenses
of
pastoral
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
provoked
a
great
outcry
among
the
local
burgesses
;
and
a
senator
*NL*
of
the
Empire
,
a
former
member
of
the
Council
of
the
Five
Hundred
*NL*
which
favored
the
18
Brumaire
,
and
who
was
provided
with
a
magnificent
*NL*
senatorial
office
in
the
vicinity
of
the
town
of
D
--
,
wrote
to
M.
*NL*
Bigot
de
Preameneu
,
the
minister
of
public
worship
,
a
very
angry
and
*NL*
confidential
note
on
the
subject
,
from
which
we
extract
these
authentic
*NL*
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Expenses
of
carriage
?
What
can
be
done
with
it
in
a
town
of
less
than
*NL*
four
thousand
inhabitants
?
Expenses
of
journeys
?
What
is
the
use
*NL*
of
these
trips
,
in
the
first
place
?
Next
,
how
can
the
posting
be
*NL*
accomplished
in
these
mountainous
parts
?
There
are
no
roads
.
No
one
*NL*
travels
otherwise
than
on
horseback
.
Even
the
bridge
between
Durance
and
*NL*
Chateau-Arnoux
can
barely
support
ox-teams
.
These
priests
are
all
thus
,
*NL*
greedy
and
avaricious
.
This
man
played
the
good
priest
when
he
*NL*
first
came
.
Now
he
does
like
the
rest
;
he
must
have
a
carriage
and
a
*NL*
posting-chaise
,
he
must
have
luxuries
,
like
the
bishops
of
the
olden
*NL*
days

this
priesthood
!

will

*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
this
affair
afforded
great
delight
to
Madame
*NL*
Magloire
.
``
Good

''
said
she
to
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
;
``
Monseigneur
*NL*

That

evening
the
Bishop
wrote
out
and
handed
to
his
sister

*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
M.
Myriel
's
budget
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
chance
episcopal
perquisites
,
the
fees
for
marriage
bans
,
*NL*
dispensations
,
private
baptisms
,
sermons
,
benedictions
,
of
churches
or
*NL*
chapels
,
marriages
,
etc.
,
the
Bishop
levied
them
on
the
wealthy
with
all
*NL*
the
more
asperity
,
since
he
bestowed
them
on
the
needy
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
,
offerings
of
money
flowed
in
.
Those
who
had
and
those
who
*NL*
lacked
knocked
at
M.
Myriel
's
door
,
--
the
latter
in
search
of
the
alms
*NL*
which
the
former
came
to
deposit
.
In
less
than
a
year
the
Bishop
had
*NL*
become
the
treasurer
of
all
benevolence
and
the
cashier
of
all
those
*NL*
in
distress
.
Considerable
sums
of
money
passed
through
his
hands
,
but
*NL*
nothing
could
induce
him
to
make
any
change
whatever
in
his
mode
of
*NL*
life
,
or
add
anything
superfluous
to
his
bare
necessities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Far
from
it
.
As
there
is
always
more
wretchedness
below
than
there
*NL*
is
brotherhood
above
,
all
was
given
away
,
so
to
speak
,
before
it
was
*NL*
received
.
It
was
like
water
on
dry
soil
;
no
matter
how
much
money
he
*NL*
received
,
he
never
had
any
.
Then
he
stripped
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usage
being
that
bishops
shall
announce
their
baptismal
names
at
the
*NL*
head
of
their
charges
and
their
pastoral
letters
,
the
poor
people
of
the
*NL*
country-side
had
selected
,
with
a
sort
of
affectionate
instinct
,
among
*NL*
the
names
and
prenomens
of
their
bishop
,
that
which
had
a
meaning
for

them

they
never
called
him
anything

Welcome

We
will
follow
their
example
,

also
call

when
we
have

Moreover

this

pleased

him

said
he

CHAPTER
III
--
A
HARD
BISHOPRIC
FOR
A
GOOD
BISHOP
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
did
not
omit
his
pastoral
visits
because
he
had
converted
his
*NL*
carriage
into
alms
.
The
diocese
of
D
--
is
a
fatiguing
one
.
There
are
*NL*
very
few
plains
and
a
great
many
mountains
;
hardly
any
roads
,
as
we
have
*NL*
just
seen
;
thirty-two
curacies
,
forty-one
vicarships
,
and
two
hundred
*NL*
and
eighty-five
auxiliary
chapels
.
To
visit
all
these
is
quite
a
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
managed
to
do
it
.
He
went
on
foot
when
it
was
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
,
in
a
tilted
spring-cart
when
it
was
on
the
plain
,
and
on
*NL*
a
donkey
in
the
mountains
.
The
two
old
women
accompanied
him
.
When
the
*NL*
trip
was
too
hard
for
them
,
he
went
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
arrived
at
Senez
,
which
is
an
ancient
episcopal
city
.
He
was
*NL*
mounted
on
an
ass
.
His
purse
,
which
was
very
dry
at
that
moment
,
did
not
*NL*
permit
him
any
other
equipage
.
The
mayor
of
the
town
came
to
receive
*NL*
him
at
the
gate
of
the
town
,
and
watched
him
dismount
from
his
ass
,
*NL*
with
scandalized
eyes
.
Some
of
the
citizens
were
laughing
around
him
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
the
Mayor
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
and
Messieurs
Citizens
,
I
*NL*
perceive
that
I
shock
you
.
You
think
it
very
arrogant
in
a
poor
priest
*NL*
to
ride
an
animal
which
was
used
by
Jesus
Christ
.
I
have
done
so
from
*NL*
necessity
,
I
assure
you
,
and
not
from
vanity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
these
trips
he
was
kind
and
indulgent
,
and
talked
*NL*
rather
than
preached
.
He
never
went
far
in
search
of
his
arguments
and
*NL*
his
examples
.
He
quoted
to
the
inhabitants
of
one
district
the
example
*NL*
of
a
neighboring
district
.
In
the
cantons
where
they
were
harsh
to
the
*NL*
poor
,
he
said
:
``
Look
at
the
people
of
Briancon
!
They
have
conferred
on
*NL*
the
poor
,
on
widows
and
orphans
,
the
right
to
have
their
meadows
mown
*NL*
three
days
in
advance
of
every
one
else
.
They
rebuild
their
houses
for
*NL*
them
gratuitously
when
they
are
ruined
.
Therefore
it
is
a
country
which
*NL*
is
blessed
by
God
.
For
a
whole
century
,
there
has
not
been
a
single
*NL*
murderer
among
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
villages
which
were
greedy
for
profit
and
harvest
,
he
said
:
``
Look
at
*NL*
the
people
of
Embrun
!
If
,
at
the
harvest
season
,
the
father
of
a
family
*NL*
has
his
son
away
on
service
in
the
army
,
and
his
daughters
at
service
in
*NL*
the
town
,
and
if
he
is
ill
and
incapacitated
,
the
cure
recommends
him
to
*NL*
the
prayers
of
the
congregation
;
and
on
Sunday
,
after
the
mass
,
all
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
village
--
men
,
women
,
and
children
--
go
to
the
poor
*NL*
man
's
field
and
do
his
harvesting
for
him
,
and
carry
his
straw
and
his
*NL*
grain
to
his
granary
.
''
To
families
divided
by
questions
of
money
and
*NL*
inheritance
he
said
:
``
Look
at
the
mountaineers
of
Devolny
,
a
country
so
*NL*
wild
that
the
nightingale
is
not
heard
there
once
in
fifty
years
.
*NL*
Well
,
when
the
father
of
a
family
dies
,
the
boys
go
off
to
seek
their
*NL*
fortunes
,
leaving
the
property
to
the
girls
,
so
that
they
may
find
*NL*
husbands
.
''
To
the
cantons
which
had
a
taste
for
lawsuits
,
and
where
the
*NL*
farmers
ruined
themselves
in
stamped
paper
,
he
said
:
``
Look
at
those
good
*NL*
peasants
in
the
valley
of
Queyras
!
There
are
three
thousand
souls
of
*NL*
them
.
Mon
Dieu
!
it
is
like
a
little
republic
.
Neither
judge
nor
bailiff
*NL*
is
known
there
.
The
mayor
does
everything
.
He
allots
the
imposts
,
*NL*
taxes
each
person
conscientiously
,
judges
quarrels
for
nothing
,
divides
*NL*
inheritances
without
charge
,
pronounces
sentences
gratuitously
;
and
he
*NL*
is
obeyed
,
because
he
is
a
just
man
among
simple
men
.
''
To
villages
where
*NL*
he
found
no
schoolmaster
,
he
quoted
once
more
the
people
of
Queyras
:
``
Do
*NL*
you
know
how
they
manage
?
''
he
said
.
``
Since
a
little
country
of
a
*NL*
dozen
or
fifteen
hearths
can
not
always
support
a
teacher
,
they
have
*NL*
school-masters
who
are
paid
by
the
whole
valley
,
who
make
the
round
*NL*
of
the
villages
,
spending
a
week
in
this
one
,
ten
days
in
that
,
and
*NL*
instruct
them
.
These
teachers
go
to
the
fairs
.
I
have
seen
them
there
.
*NL*
They
are
to
be
recognized
by
the
quill
pens
which
they
wear
in
the
cord
*NL*
of
their
hat
.
Those
who
teach
reading
only
have
one
pen
;
those
who
teach
*NL*
reading
and
reckoning
have
two
pens
;
those
who
teach
reading
,
reckoning
,
*NL*
and
Latin
have
three
pens
.
But
what
a
disgrace
to
be
ignorant
!
Do
like
*NL*
the
people
of
Queyras
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
discoursed
gravely
and
paternally
;
in
default
of
examples
,
he
*NL*
invented
parables
,
going
directly
to
the
point
,
with
few
phrases
and
*NL*
many
images
,
which
characteristic
formed
the
real
eloquence
of
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
.
And
being
convinced
himself
,
he
was
persuasive
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
WORKS
CORRESPONDING
TO
WORDS
*NL*
*NL*
His
conversation
was
gay
and
affable
.
He
put
himself
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
two
old
women
who
had
passed
their
lives
beside
him
.
When
he
laughed
,
*NL*
it
was
the
laugh
of
a
schoolboy
.
Madame
Magloire
liked
to
call
him
Your
*NL*
Grace
-LSB-
Votre
Grandeur
-RSB-
.
One
day
he
rose
from
his
arm-chair
,
and
went
*NL*
to
his
library
in
search
of
a
book
.
This
book
was
on
one
of
the
upper
*NL*
shelves
.
As
the
bishop
was
rather
short
of
stature
,
he
could
not
*NL*
reach
it
.
``
Madame
Magloire
,
''
said
he
,
``
fetch
me
a
chair
.
My
greatness
*NL*
-LSB-
grandeur
-RSB-
does
not
reach
as
far
as
that
shelf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
his
distant
relatives
,
Madame
la
Comtesse
de
Lo
,
rarely
allowed
*NL*
an
opportunity
to
escape
of
enumerating
,
in
his
presence
,
what
she
*NL*
designated
as
``
the
expectations
''
of
her
three
sons
.
She
had
numerous
*NL*
relatives
,
who
were
very
old
and
near
to
death
,
and
of
whom
her
sons
*NL*
were
the
natural
heirs
.
The
youngest
of
the
three
was
to
receive
from
a
*NL*
grand-aunt
a
good
hundred
thousand
livres
of
income
;
the
second
was
the
*NL*
heir
by
entail
to
the
title
of
the
Duke
,
his
uncle
;
the
eldest
was
to
*NL*
succeed
to
the
peerage
of
his
grandfather
.
The
Bishop
was
accustomed
to
*NL*
listen
in
silence
to
these
innocent
and
pardonable
maternal
boasts
.
On
*NL*
one
occasion
,
however
,
he
appeared
to
be
more
thoughtful
than
usual
,
*NL*
while
Madame
de
Lo
was
relating
once
again
the
details
of
all
these
*NL*
inheritances
and
all
these
``
expectations
.
''
She
interrupted
herself
*NL*
impatiently
:
``
Mon
Dieu
,
cousin
!
What
are
you
thinking
about
?
''
``
I
am
*NL*
thinking
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
,
``
of
a
singular
remark
,
which
is
to
be
*NL*
found
,
I
believe
,
in
St.
Augustine
,
--
`
Place
your
hopes
in
the
man
from
*NL*
whom
you
do
not
inherit
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
another
time
,
on
receiving
a
notification
of
the
decease
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
the
country-side
,
wherein
not
only
the
dignities
of
the
*NL*
dead
man
,
but
also
the
feudal
and
noble
qualifications
of
all
his
*NL*
relatives
,
spread
over
an
entire
page
:
``
What
a
stout
back
Death
has
!
''
*NL*
he
exclaimed
.
``
What
a
strange
burden
of
titles
is
cheerfully
imposed
*NL*
on
him
,
and
how
much
wit
must
men
have
,
in
order
thus
to
press
the
tomb
*NL*
into
the
service
of
vanity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gifted
,
on
occasion
,
with
a
gentle
raillery
,
which
almost
always
*NL*
concealed
a
serious
meaning
.
In
the
course
of
one
Lent
,
a
youthful
vicar
*NL*
came
to
D
--
,
and
preached
in
the
cathedral
.
He
was
tolerably
eloquent
.
*NL*
The
subject
of
his
sermon
was
charity
.
He
urged
the
rich
to
give
to
the
*NL*
poor
,
in
order
to
avoid
hell
,
which
he
depicted
in
the
most
frightful
*NL*
manner
of
which
he
was
capable
,
and
to
win
paradise
,
which
he
*NL*
represented
as
charming
and
desirable
.
Among
the
audience
there
was
*NL*
a
wealthy
retired
merchant
,
who
was
somewhat
of
a
usurer
,
named
M.
*NL*
Geborand
,
who
had
amassed
two
millions
in
the
manufacture
of
coarse
*NL*
cloth
,
serges
,
and
woollen
galloons
.
Never
in
his
whole
life
had
M.
*NL*
Geborand
bestowed
alms
on
any
poor
wretch
.
After
the
delivery
of
that
*NL*
sermon
,
it
was
observed
that
he
gave
a
sou
every
Sunday
to
the
poor
old
*NL*
beggar-women
at
the
door
of
the
cathedral
.
There
were
six
of
them
to
*NL*
share
it
.
One
day
the
Bishop
caught
sight
of
him
in
the
act
of
bestowing
*NL*
this
charity
,
and
said
to
his
sister
,
with
a
smile
,
``
There
is
M.
*NL*
Geborand
purchasing
paradise
for
a
sou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
was
a
question
of
charity
,
he
was
not
to
be
rebuffed
even
by
*NL*
a
refusal
,
and
on
such
occasions
he
gave
utterance
to
remarks
which
*NL*
induced
reflection
.
Once
he
was
begging
for
the
poor
in
a
drawing-room
*NL*
of
the
town
;
there
was
present
the
Marquis
de
Champtercier
,
a
wealthy
*NL*
and
avaricious
old
man
,
who
contrived
to
be
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
*NL*
an
ultra-royalist
and
an
ultra-Voltairian
.
This
variety
of
man
has
*NL*
actually
existed
.
When
the
Bishop
came
to
him
,
he
touched
his
arm
,
``
You
*NL*
must
give
me
something
,
M.
le
Marquis
.
''
The
Marquis
turned
round
and
*NL*
answered
dryly
,
``
I
have
poor
people
of
my
own
,
Monseigneur
.
''
``
Give
them
*NL*
to
me
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
preached
the
following
sermon
in
the
cathedral
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
very
dear
brethren
,
my
good
friends
,
there
are
thirteen
hundred
*NL*
and
twenty
thousand
peasants
'
dwellings
in
France
which
have
but
three
*NL*
openings
;
eighteen
hundred
and
seventeen
thousand
hovels
which
have
but
*NL*
two
openings
,
the
door
and
one
window
;
and
three
hundred
and
forty-six
*NL*
thousand
cabins
besides
which
have
but
one
opening
,
the
door
.
And
this
*NL*
arises
from
a
thing
which
is
called
the
tax
on
doors
and
windows
.
Just
*NL*
put
poor
families
,
old
women
and
little
children
,
in
those
buildings
,
*NL*
and
behold
the
fevers
and
maladies
which
result
!
Alas
!
God
gives
air
to
*NL*
men
;
the
law
sells
it
to
them
.
I
do
not
blame
the
law
,
but
I
bless
God
.

In
the
department
of
the
Isere
,
in
the
Var
,
in
the
two
departments
*NL*
of
the
Alpes
,
the
Hautes
,
and
the
Basses
,
the
peasants
have
not
even
*NL*
wheelbarrows
;
they
transport
their
manure
on
the
backs
of
men
;
they
have
*NL*
no
candles
,
and
they
burn
resinous
sticks
,
and
bits
of
rope
dipped
in
*NL*
pitch
.
That
is
the
state
of
affairs
throughout
the
whole
of
the
hilly
*NL*
country
of
Dauphine
.
They
make
bread
for
six
months
at
one
time
;
they
*NL*
bake
it
with
dried
cow-dung
.
In
the
winter
they
break
this
bread
up
with
*NL*
an
axe
,
and
they
soak
it
for
twenty-four
hours
,
in
order
to
render
it
*NL*
eatable
.
My
brethren
,
have
pity
!
behold
the
suffering
on
all
sides
of
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Born
a
Provencal
,
he
easily
familiarized
himself
with
the
dialect
of
the
*NL*
south
.
He
said
,
``
En
be
!
moussu
,
ses
sage
?
''
as
in
lower
Languedoc
;
``
Onte
*NL*

''
as
in
the
Basses-Alpes
;
``
Puerte
un
bouen

embe
un
*NL*
bouen

grase
,
''
as
in
upper
Dauphine
.
This
pleased
the
people
*NL*
extremely
,
and
contributed
not
a
little
to
win
him
access
to
all
*NL*
spirits
.
He
was
perfectly
at
home
in
the
thatched
cottage
and
in
the
*NL*
mountains
.
He
understood
how
to
say
the
grandest
things
in
the
most
*NL*
vulgar
of
idioms
.
As
he
spoke
all
tongues
,
he
entered
into
all
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
was
the
same
towards
people
of
the
world
and
towards
*NL*
the
lower
classes
.
He
condemned
nothing
in
haste
and
without
taking
*NL*
circumstances
into
account
.
He
said
,
``
Examine
the
road
over
which
the
*NL*
fault
has
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
,
as
he
described
himself
with
a
smile
,
an
ex-sinner
,
he
had
none
*NL*
of
the
asperities
of
austerity
,
and
he
professed
,
with
a
good
deal
*NL*
of
distinctness
,
and
without
the
frown
of
the
ferociously
virtuous
,
a
*NL*
doctrine
which
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Man
has
upon
him
his
flesh
,
which
is
at
once
his
burden
and
his
*NL*
temptation
.
He
drags
it
with
him
and
yields
to
it
.
He
must
watch
it
,
*NL*
check
it
,
repress
it
,
and
obey
it
only
at
the
last
extremity
.
There
may
*NL*
be
some
fault
even
in
this
obedience
;
but
the
fault
thus
committed
is
*NL*
venial
;
it
is
a
fall
,
but
a
fall
on
the
knees
which
may
terminate
in
*NL*
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
a
saint
is
the
exception
;
to
be
an
upright
man
is
the
rule
.
Err
,
*NL*
fall
,
sin
if
you
will
,
but
be
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
least
possible
sin
is
the
law
of
man
.
No
sin
at
all
is
the
dream
*NL*
of
the
angel
.
All
which
is
terrestrial
is
subject
to
sin
.
Sin
is
a
*NL*
gravitation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
everyone
exclaiming
very
loudly
,
and
growing
angry
very
*NL*
quickly
,
``
Oh
!
oh
!
''
he
said
,
with
a
smile
;
``
to
all
appearance
,
this
is
*NL*
a
great
crime
which
all
the
world
commits
.
These
are
hypocrisies
*NL*
which
have
taken
fright
,
and
are
in
haste
to
make
protest
and
to
put
*NL*
themselves
under
shelter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
indulgent
towards
women
and
poor
people
,
on
whom
the
burden
of
*NL*
human
society
rest
.
He
said
,
``
The
faults
of
women
,
of
children
,
of
the
*NL*
feeble
,
the
indigent
,
and
the
ignorant
,
are
the
fault
of
the
husbands
,
*NL*
the
fathers
,
the
masters
,
the
strong
,
the
rich
,
and
the
wise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
moreover
,
``
Teach
those
who
are
ignorant
as
many
things
as
*NL*
possible
;
society
is
culpable
,
in
that
it
does
not
afford
instruction
*NL*
gratis
;
it
is
responsible
for
the
night
which
it
produces
.
This
soul
*NL*
is
full
of
shadow
;
sin
is
therein
committed
.
The
guilty
one
is
not
the
*NL*
person
who
has
committed
the
sin
,
but
the
person
who
has
created
the
*NL*
shadow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
perceived
that
he
had
a
peculiar
manner
of
his
own
of
judging
*NL*
things
:
I
suspect
that
he
obtained
it
from
the
Gospel
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
heard
a
criminal
case
,
which
was
in
preparation
and
on
the
*NL*
point
of
trial
,
discussed
in
a
drawing-room
.
A
wretched
man
,
being
at
*NL*
the
end
of
his
resources
,
had
coined
counterfeit
money
,
out
of
love
for
*NL*
a
woman
,
and
for
the
child
which
he
had
had
by
her
.
Counterfeiting
was
*NL*
still
punishable
with
death
at
that
epoch
.
The
woman
had
been
arrested
*NL*
in
the
act
of
passing
the
first
false
piece
made
by
the
man
.
She
was
*NL*
held
,
but
there
were
no
proofs
except
against
her
.
She
alone
could
*NL*
accuse
her
lover
,
and
destroy
him
by
her
confession
.
She
denied
;
they
*NL*
insisted
.
She
persisted
in
her
denial
.
Thereupon
an
idea
occurred
to
*NL*
the
attorney
for
the
crown
.
He
invented
an
infidelity
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
lover
,
and
succeeded
,
by
means
of
fragments
of
letters
cunningly
*NL*
presented
,
in
persuading
the
unfortunate
woman
that
she
had
a
rival
,
and
*NL*
that
the
man
was
deceiving
her
.
Thereupon
,
exasperated
by
jealousy
,
she
*NL*
denounced
her
lover
,
confessed
all
,
proved
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
was
ruined
.
He
was
shortly
to
be
tried
at
Aix
with
his
*NL*
accomplice
.
They
were
relating
the
matter
,
and
each
one
was
expressing
*NL*
enthusiasm
over
the
cleverness
of
the
magistrate
.
By
bringing
jealousy
*NL*
into
play
,
he
had
caused
the
truth
to
burst
forth
in
wrath
,
he
had
*NL*
educed
the
justice
of
revenge
.
The
Bishop
listened
to
all
this
in
*NL*
silence
.
When
they
had
finished
,
he
inquired
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
this
man
and
woman
to
be
tried
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Court
of
Assizes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
,
``
And
where
will
the
advocate
of
the
crown
be
tried
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tragic
event
occurred
at
D
--
A
man
was
condemned
to
death
for
*NL*
murder
.
He
was
a
wretched
fellow
,
not
exactly
educated
,
not
exactly
*NL*
ignorant
,
who
had
been
a
mountebank
at
fairs
,
and
a
writer
for
the
*NL*
public
.
The
town
took
a
great
interest
in
the
trial
.
On
the
eve
of
the
*NL*
day
fixed
for
the
execution
of
the
condemned
man
,
the
chaplain
of
the
*NL*
prison
fell
ill
.
A
priest
was
needed
to
attend
the
criminal
in
his
*NL*
last
moments
.
They
sent
for
the
cure
.
It
seems
that
he
refused
to
come
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
That
is
no
affair
of
mine
.
I
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
*NL*
unpleasant
task
,
and
with
that
mountebank
:
I
,
too
,
am
ill
;
and
besides
,
*NL*
it
is
not
my
place
.
''
This
reply
was
reported
to
the
Bishop
,
who
said
,
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Cure
is
right
:
it
is
not
his
place
;
it
is
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
instantly
to
the
prison
,
descended
to
the
cell
of
the
*NL*
``
mountebank
,
''
called
him
by
name
,
took
him
by
the
hand
,
and
spoke
to
*NL*
him
.
He
passed
the
entire
day
with
him
,
forgetful
of
food
and
sleep
,
*NL*
praying
to
God
for
the
soul
of
the
condemned
man
,
and
praying
the
*NL*
condemned
man
for
his
own
.
He
told
him
the
best
truths
,
which
are
also
*NL*
the
most
simple
.
He
was
father
,
brother
,
friend
;
he
was
bishop
only
to
*NL*
bless
.
He
taught
him
everything
,
encouraged
and
consoled
him
.
The
man
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
dying
in
despair
.
Death
was
an
abyss
to
him
.
As
he
*NL*
stood
trembling
on
its
mournful
brink
,
he
recoiled
with
horror
.
He
*NL*
was
not
sufficiently
ignorant
to
be
absolutely
indifferent
.
His
*NL*
condemnation
,
which
had
been
a
profound
shock
,
had
,
in
a
manner
,
broken
*NL*
through
,
here
and
there
,
that
wall
which
separates
us
from
the
mystery
*NL*
of
things
,
and
which
we
call
life
.
He
gazed
incessantly
beyond
this
*NL*
world
through
these
fatal
breaches
,
and
beheld
only
darkness
.
The
Bishop
*NL*
made
him
see
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
when
they
came
to
fetch
the
unhappy
wretch
,
the
*NL*
Bishop
was
still
there
.
He
followed
him
,
and
exhibited
himself
to
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
crowd
in
his
purple
camail
and
with
his
episcopal
cross
upon
*NL*
his
neck
,
side
by
side
with
the
criminal
bound
with
cords
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
mounted
the
tumbril
with
him
,
he
mounted
the
scaffold
with
him
.
The
*NL*
sufferer
,
who
had
been
so
gloomy
and
cast
down
on
the
preceding
day
,
was
*NL*
radiant
.
He
felt
that
his
soul
was
reconciled
,
and
he
hoped
in
God
.
The
*NL*
Bishop
embraced
him
,
and
at
the
moment
when
the
knife
was
about
to
fall
,
*NL*
he
said
to
him
:
``
God
raises
from
the
dead
him
whom
man
slays
;
he
whom
*NL*
his
brothers
have
rejected
finds
his
Father
once
more
.
Pray
,
believe
,
*NL*
enter
into
life
:
the
Father
is
there
.
''
When
he
descended
from
the
*NL*
scaffold
,
there
was
something
in
his
look
which
made
the
people
draw
*NL*
aside
to
let
him
pass
.
They
did
not
know
which
was
most
worthy
of
*NL*
admiration
,
his
pallor
or
his
serenity
.
On
his
return
to
the
humble
*NL*
dwelling
,
which
he
designated
,
with
a
smile
,
as
his
palace
,
he
said
to
*NL*
his
sister
,
``
I
have
just
officiated
pontifically
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
most
sublime
things
are
often
those
which
are
the
least
*NL*
understood
,
there
were
people
in
the
town
who
said
,
when
commenting
on
*NL*
this
conduct
of
the
Bishop
,
``
It
is
affectation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
however
,
was
a
remark
which
was
confined
to
the
drawing-rooms
.
*NL*
The
populace
,
which
perceives
no
jest
in
holy
deeds
,
was
touched
,
and
*NL*
admired
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
Bishop
,
it
was
a
shock
to
him
to
have
beheld
the
guillotine
,
*NL*
and
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
recovered
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
when
the
scaffold
is
there
,
all
erected
and
prepared
,
it
has
*NL*
something
about
it
which
produces
hallucination
.
One
may
feel
a
certain
*NL*
indifference
to
the
death
penalty
,
one
may
refrain
from
pronouncing
upon
*NL*
it
,
from
saying
yes
or
no
,
so
long
as
one
has
not
seen
a
guillotine
with
*NL*
one
's
own
eyes
:
but
if
one
encounters
one
of
them
,
the
shock
is
violent
;
*NL*
one
is
forced
to
decide
,
and
to
take
part
for
or
against
.
Some
admire
*NL*
it
,
like
de
Maistre
;
others
execrate
it
,
like
Beccaria
.
The
guillotine
*NL*
is
the
concretion
of
the
law
;
it
is
called
vindicte
;
it
is
not
neutral
,
*NL*
and
it
does
not
permit
you
to
remain
neutral
.
He
who
sees
it
shivers
*NL*
with
the
most
mysterious
of
shivers
.
All
social
problems
erect
their
*NL*
interrogation
point
around
this
chopping-knife
.
The
scaffold
is
a
*NL*
vision
.
The
scaffold
is
not
a
piece
of
carpentry
;
the
scaffold
is
not
*NL*
a
machine
;
the
scaffold
is
not
an
inert
bit
of
mechanism
constructed
of
*NL*
wood
,
iron
and
cords
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
as
though
it
were
a
being
,
possessed
of
I
know
not
what
sombre
*NL*
initiative
;
one
would
say
that
this
piece
of
carpenter
's
work
saw
,
that
*NL*
this
machine
heard
,
that
this
mechanism
understood
,
that
this
wood
,
*NL*
this
iron
,
and
these
cords
were
possessed
of
will
.
In
the
frightful
*NL*
meditation
into
which
its
presence
casts
the
soul
the
scaffold
appears
*NL*
in
terrible
guise
,
and
as
though
taking
part
in
what
is
going
on
.
The
*NL*
scaffold
is
the
accomplice
of
the
executioner
;
it
devours
,
it
eats
*NL*
flesh
,
it
drinks
blood
;
the
scaffold
is
a
sort
of
monster
fabricated
*NL*
by
the
judge
and
the
carpenter
,
a
spectre
which
seems
to
live
with
a
*NL*
horrible
vitality
composed
of
all
the
death
which
it
has
inflicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Therefore
,
the
impression
was
terrible
and
profound
;
on
the
day
*NL*
following
the
execution
,
and
on
many
succeeding
days
,
the
Bishop
*NL*
appeared
to
be
crushed
.
The
almost
violent
serenity
of
the
funereal
*NL*
moment
had
disappeared
;
the
phantom
of
social
justice
tormented
him
.
He
,
*NL*
who
generally
returned
from
all
his
deeds
with
a
radiant
satisfaction
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
reproaching
himself
.
At
times
he
talked
to
himself
,
and
*NL*
stammered
lugubrious
monologues
in
a
low
voice
.
This
is
one
which
his
*NL*
sister
overheard
one
evening
and
preserved
:
``
I
did
not
think
that
it
was
*NL*
so
monstrous
.
It
is
wrong
to
become
absorbed
in
the
divine
law
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
as
not
to
perceive
human
law
.
Death
belongs
to
God
alone
.
By
what
*NL*
right
do
men
touch
that
unknown
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
course
of
time
these
impressions
weakened
and
probably
vanished
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
it
was
observed
that
the
Bishop
thenceforth
avoided
*NL*
passing
the
place
of
execution
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Myriel
could
be
summoned
at
any
hour
to
the
bedside
of
the
sick
and
*NL*
dying
.
He
did
not
ignore
the
fact
that
therein
lay
his
greatest
duty
and
*NL*
his
greatest
labor
.
Widowed
and
orphaned
families
had
no
need
to
summon
*NL*
him
;
he
came
of
his
own
accord
.
He
understood
how
to
sit
down
and
hold
*NL*
his
peace
for
long
hours
beside
the
man
who
had
lost
the
wife
of
his
*NL*
love
,
of
the
mother
who
had
lost
her
child
.
As
he
knew
the
moment
for
*NL*
silence
he
knew
also
the
moment
for
speech
.
Oh
,
admirable
consoler
!
He
*NL*
sought
not
to
efface
sorrow
by
forgetfulness
,
but
to
magnify
and
dignify
*NL*
it
by
hope
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
care
of
the
manner
in
which
you
turn
towards
the
dead
.
Think
*NL*
not
of
that
which
perishes
.
Gaze
steadily
.
You
will
perceive
the
living
*NL*
light
of
your
well-beloved
dead
in
the
depths
of
heaven
.
''
He
knew
that
*NL*
faith
is
wholesome
.
He
sought
to
counsel
and
calm
the
despairing
man
,
by
*NL*
pointing
out
to
him
the
resigned
man
,
and
to
transform
the
grief
which
*NL*
gazes
upon
a
grave
by
showing
him
the
grief
which
fixes
its
gaze
upon
a
*NL*
star
.

CHAPTER

MONSEIGNEUR
BIENVENU
MADE
HIS
CASSOCKS
LAST
TOO
LONG
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
private
life
of
M.
Myriel
was
filled
with
the
same
thoughts
as
his
*NL*
public
life
.
The
voluntary
poverty
in
which
the
Bishop
of
D
--
lived
,
*NL*
would
have
been
a
solemn
and
charming
sight
for
any
one
who
could
have
*NL*
viewed
it
close
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
old
men
,
and
like
the
majority
of
thinkers
,
he
slept
little
.
*NL*
This
brief
slumber
was
profound
.
In
the
morning
he
meditated
for
an
*NL*
hour
,
then
he
said
his
mass
,
either
at
the
cathedral
or
in
his
own
*NL*
house
.
His
mass
said
,
he
broke
his
fast
on
rye
bread
dipped
in
the
milk
*NL*
of
his
own
cows
.
Then
he
set
to
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Bishop
is
a
very
busy
man
:
he
must
every
day
receive
the
secretary
*NL*
of
the
bishopric
,
who
is
generally
a
canon
,
and
nearly
every
day
his
*NL*
vicars-general
.
He
has
congregations
to
reprove
,
privileges
to
grant
,
*NL*
a
whole
ecclesiastical
library
to
examine
,
--
prayer-books
,
diocesan
*NL*
catechisms
,
books
of
hours
,
etc.
,
--
charges
to
write
,
sermons
to
*NL*
authorize
,
cures
and
mayors
to
reconcile
,
a
clerical
correspondence
,
an
*NL*
administrative
correspondence
;
on
one
side
the
State
,
on
the
other
the
*NL*
Holy
See
;
and
a
thousand
matters
of
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
time
was
left
to
him
,
after
these
thousand
details
of
business
,
and
*NL*
his
offices
and
his
breviary
,
he
bestowed
first
on
the
necessitous
,
*NL*
the
sick
,
and
the
afflicted
;
the
time
which
was
left
to
him
from
the
*NL*
afflicted
,
the
sick
,
and
the
necessitous
,
he
devoted
to
work
.
Sometimes
*NL*
he
dug
in
his
garden
;
again
,
he
read
or
wrote
.
He
had
but
one
word
*NL*
for
both
these
kinds
of
toil
;
he
called
them
gardening
.
``
The
mind
is
a
*NL*
garden
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
mid-day
,
when
the
weather
was
fine
,
he
went
forth
and
took
a
*NL*
stroll
in
the
country
or
in
town
,
often
entering
lowly
dwellings
.
He
*NL*
was
seen
walking
alone
,
buried
in
his
own
thoughts
,
his
eyes
cast
down
,
*NL*
supporting
himself
on
his
long
cane
,
clad
in
his
wadded
purple
garment
*NL*
of
silk
,
which
was
very
warm
,
wearing
purple
stockings
inside
his
coarse
*NL*
shoes
,
and
surmounted
by
a
flat
hat
which
allowed
three
golden
tassels
*NL*
of
large
bullion
to
droop
from
its
three
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
perfect
festival
wherever
he
appeared
.
One
would
have
said
that
*NL*
his
presence
had
something
warming
and
luminous
about
it
.
The
children
*NL*
and
the
old
people
came
out
to
the
doorsteps
for
the
Bishop
as
for
the
*NL*
sun
.
He
bestowed
his
blessing
,
and
they
blessed
him
.
They
pointed
out
*NL*
his
house
to
any
one
who
was
in
need
of
anything
.

Here
and
there
he
halted
,
accosted
the
little
boys
and
girls
,
and
smiled
*NL*
upon
the
mothers
.
He
visited
the
poor
so
long
as
he
had
any
money
;
when
*NL*
he
no
longer
had
any
,
he
visited
the
rich
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
made
his
cassocks
last
a
long
while
,
and
did
not
wish
to
have
it
*NL*
noticed
,
he
never
went
out
in
the
town
without
his
wadded
purple
cloak
.
*NL*
This
inconvenienced
him
somewhat
in
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
return
,
he
dined
.
The
dinner
resembled
his
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
eight
in
the
evening
he
supped
with
his
sister
,
Madame
*NL*
Magloire
standing
behind
them
and
serving
them
at
table
.
Nothing
could
*NL*
be
more
frugal
than
this
repast
.
If
,
however
,
the
Bishop
had
one
of
his
*NL*
cures
to
supper
,
Madame
Magloire
took
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
*NL*
serve
Monseigneur
with
some
excellent
fish
from
the
lake
,
or
with
some
*NL*
fine
game
from
the
mountains
.
Every
cure
furnished
the
pretext
for
*NL*
a
good
meal
:
the
Bishop
did
not
interfere
.
With
that
exception
,
his
*NL*
ordinary
diet
consisted
only
of
vegetables
boiled
in
water
,
and
oil
*NL*
soup
.
Thus
it
was
said
in
the
town
,
when
the
Bishop
does
not
indulge
in
*NL*
the
cheer
of
a
cure
,
he
indulges
in
the
cheer
of
a
trappist
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
he
conversed
for
half
an
hour
with
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
*NL*
and
Madame
Magloire
;
then
he
retired
to
his
own
room
and
set
to
writing
,
*NL*
sometimes
on
loose
sheets
,
and
again
on
the
margin
of
some
folio
.
He
was
*NL*
a
man
of
letters
and
rather
learned
.
He
left
behind
him
five
or
six
*NL*
very
curious
manuscripts
;
among
others
,
a
dissertation
on
this
verse
in
*NL*
Genesis
,
In
the
beginning
,
the
spirit
of
God
floated
upon
the
waters
.
*NL*
With
this
verse
he
compares
three
texts
:
the
Arabic
verse
which
says
,
*NL*
The
winds
of
God
blew
;
Flavius
Josephus
who
says
,
A
wind
from
above
was
*NL*
precipitated
upon
the
earth
;
and
finally
,
the
Chaldaic
paraphrase
of
*NL*
Onkelos
,
which
renders
it
,
A
wind
coming
from
God
blew
upon
the
face
of
*NL*
the
waters
.
In
another
dissertation
,
he
examines
the
theological
works
*NL*
of
Hugo
,
Bishop
of
Ptolemais
,
great-grand-uncle
to
the
writer
of
this
*NL*
book
,
and
establishes
the
fact
,
that
to
this
bishop
must
be
attributed
*NL*
the
divers
little
works
published
during
the
last
century
,
under
the
*NL*
pseudonym
of
Barleycourt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
in
the
midst
of
his
reading
,
no
matter
what
the
book
might
*NL*
be
which
he
had
in
his
hand
,
he
would
suddenly
fall
into
a
profound
*NL*
meditation
,
whence
he
only
emerged
to
write
a
few
lines
on
the
pages
of
*NL*
the
volume
itself
.
These
lines
have
often
no
connection
whatever
with
*NL*
the
book
which
contains
them
.
We
now
have
under
our
eyes
a
note
written
*NL*
by
him
on
the
margin
of
a
quarto
entitled
Correspondence
of

``

Toward
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
the
two
women
retired
and
betook
*NL*
themselves
to
their
chambers

floor

leaving
him
alone
until

It
is
necessary
that

in

give
an

CHAPTER
VI
--
WHO
GUARDED
HIS
HOUSE
FOR
HIM
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
in
which
he
lived
consisted
,
as
we
have
said
,
of
a
ground
*NL*
floor
,
and
one
story
above
;
three
rooms
on
the
ground
floor
,
three
*NL*
chambers
on
the
first
,
and
an
attic
above
.
Behind
the
house
was
a
*NL*
garden
,
a
quarter
of
an
acre
in
extent
.
The
two
women
occupied
the
*NL*
first
floor
;
the
Bishop
was
lodged
below
.
The
first
room
,
opening
on
the
*NL*
street
,
served
him
as
dining-room
,
the
second
was
his
bedroom
,
and
the
*NL*
third
his
oratory
.
There
was
no
exit
possible
from
this
oratory
,
except
*NL*
by
passing
through
the
bedroom
,
nor
from
the
bedroom
,
without
passing
*NL*
through
the
dining-room
.
At
the
end
of
the
suite
,
in
the
oratory
,
there
*NL*
was
a
detached
alcove
with
a
bed
,
for
use
in
cases
of
hospitality
.
*NL*
The
Bishop
offered
this
bed
to
country
curates
whom
business
or
the
*NL*
requirements
of
their
parishes
brought
to
D
--
*NL*
*NL*
The
pharmacy
of
the
hospital
,
a
small
building
which
had
been
added
*NL*
to
the
house
,
and
abutted
on
the
garden
,
had
been
transformed
into
*NL*
a
kitchen
and
cellar
.
In
addition
to
this
,
there
was
in
the
garden
a
*NL*
stable
,
which
had
formerly
been
the
kitchen
of
the
hospital
,
and
in
*NL*
which
the
Bishop
kept
two
cows
.
No
matter
what
the
quantity
of
milk
they
*NL*
gave
,
he
invariably
sent
half
of
it
every
morning
to
the
sick
people
in
*NL*
the
hospital
.
``
I
am
paying
my
tithes
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
bedroom
was
tolerably
large
,
and
rather
difficult
to
warm
in
bad
*NL*
weather
.
As
wood
is
extremely
dear
at
D
--
,
he
hit
upon
the
idea
of
*NL*
having
a
compartment
of
boards
constructed
in
the
cow-shed
.
Here
he
*NL*
passed
his
evenings
during
seasons
of
severe
cold
:
he
called
it
his
*NL*
winter
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
winter
salon
,
as
in
the
dining-room
,
there
was
no
other
*NL*
furniture
than
a
square
table
in
white
wood
,
and
four
straw-seated
*NL*
chairs
.
In
addition
to
this
the
dining-room
was
ornamented
with
an
*NL*
antique
sideboard
,
painted
pink
,
in
water
colors
.
Out
of
a
similar
*NL*
sideboard
,
properly
draped
with
white
napery
and
imitation
lace
,
the
*NL*
Bishop
had
constructed
the
altar
which
decorated
his
oratory
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wealthy
penitents
and
the
sainted
women
of
D
--
had
more
than
once
*NL*
assessed
themselves
to
raise
the
money
for
a
new
altar
for
Monseigneur
's
*NL*
oratory
;
on
each
occasion
he
had
taken
the
money
and
had
given
it
to
*NL*
the
poor
.
``
The
most
beautiful
of
altars
,
''
he
said
,
``
is
the
soul
of
an
*NL*
unhappy
creature
consoled
and
thanking
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
oratory
there
were
two
straw
prie-Dieu
,
and
there
was
an
*NL*
arm-chair
,
also
in
straw
,
in
his
bedroom
.
When
,
by
chance
,
he
received
*NL*
seven
or
eight
persons
at
one
time
,
the
prefect
,
or
the
general
,
or
the
*NL*
staff
of
the
regiment
in
garrison
,
or
several
pupils
from
the
little
*NL*
seminary
,
the
chairs
had
to
be
fetched
from
the
winter
salon
in
the
*NL*
stable
,
the
prie-Dieu
from
the
oratory
,
and
the
arm-chair
from
the
*NL*
bedroom
:
in
this
way
as
many
as
eleven
chairs
could
be
collected
for
the
*NL*
visitors
.
A
room
was
dismantled
for
each
new
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happened
that
there
were
twelve
in
the
party
;
the
Bishop
*NL*
then
relieved
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
by
standing
in
front
*NL*
of
the
chimney
if
it
was
winter
,
or
by
strolling
in
the
garden
if
it
was
*NL*
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
another
chair
in
the
detached
alcove
,
but
the
straw
was
*NL*
half
gone
from
it
,
and
it
had
but
three
legs
,
so
that
it
was
of
service
*NL*
only
when
propped
against
the
wall
.
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
had
also
in
*NL*
her
own
room
a
very
large
easy-chair
of
wood
,
which
had
formerly
been
*NL*
gilded
,
and
which
was
covered
with
flowered
pekin
;
but
they
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
hoist
this
bergere
up
to
the
first
story
through
the
window
,
*NL*
as
the
staircase
was
too
narrow
;
it
could
not
,
therefore
,
be
reckoned
*NL*
among
the
possibilities
in
the
way
of
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
's
ambition
had
been
to
be
able
to
purchase
a
set
*NL*
of
drawing-room
furniture
in
yellow
Utrecht
velvet
,
stamped
with
a
rose
*NL*
pattern
,
and
with
mahogany
in
swan
's
neck
style
,
with
a
sofa
.
But
this
*NL*
would
have
cost
five
hundred
francs
at
least
,
and
in
view
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
she
had
only
been
able
to
lay
by
forty-two
francs
and
ten
sous
for
*NL*
this
purpose
in
the
course
of
five
years
,
she
had
ended
by
renouncing
*NL*
the
idea
.
However
,
who
is
there
who
has
attained
his
ideal
?
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
easy
to
present
to
the
imagination
than
the
Bishop
's
*NL*
bedchamber
.
A
glazed
door
opened
on
the
garden
;
opposite
this
was
the
*NL*
bed
,
--
a
hospital
bed
of
iron
,
with
a
canopy
of
green
serge
;
in
the
*NL*
shadow
of
the
bed
,
behind
a
curtain
,
were
the
utensils
of
the
toilet
,
*NL*
which
still
betrayed
the
elegant
habits
of
the
man
of
the
world
:
there
*NL*
were
two
doors
,
one
near
the
chimney
,
opening
into
the
oratory
;
the
*NL*
other
near
the
bookcase
,
opening
into
the
dining-room
.
The
bookcase
was
*NL*
a
large
cupboard
with
glass
doors
filled
with
books
;
the
chimney
was
of
*NL*
wood
painted
to
represent
marble
,
and
habitually
without
fire
.
In
the
*NL*
chimney
stood
a
pair
of
firedogs
of
iron
,
ornamented
above
with
two
*NL*
garlanded
vases
,
and
flutings
which
had
formerly
been
silvered
*NL*
with
silver
leaf
,
which
was
a
sort
of
episcopal
luxury
;
above
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
hung
a
crucifix
of
copper
,
with
the
silver
worn
off
,
fixed
*NL*
on
a
background
of
threadbare
velvet
in
a
wooden
frame
from
which
the
*NL*
gilding
had
fallen
;
near
the
glass
door
a
large
table
with
an
inkstand
,
*NL*
loaded
with
a
confusion
of
papers
and
with
huge
volumes
;
before
the
*NL*
table
an
arm-chair
of
straw
;
in
front
of
the
bed
a
prie-Dieu
,
borrowed
*NL*
from
the
oratory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
portraits
in
oval
frames
were
fastened
to
the
wall
on
each
side
of
*NL*
the
bed
.
Small
gilt
inscriptions
on
the
plain
surface
of
the
cloth
at
*NL*
the
side
of
these
figures
indicated
that
the
portraits
represented
,
*NL*
one
the
Abbe
of
Chaliot
,
bishop
of
Saint
Claude
;
the
other
,
the
Abbe
*NL*
Tourteau
,
vicar-general
of
Agde
,
abbe
of
Grand-Champ
,
order
of
Citeaux
,
*NL*
diocese
of
Chartres
.
When
the
Bishop
succeeded
to
this
apartment
,
after
*NL*
the
hospital
patients
,
he
had
found
these
portraits
there
,
and
had
left
*NL*
them
.
They
were
priests
,
and
probably
donors
--
two
reasons
for
respecting
*NL*
them
.
All
that
he
knew
about
these
two
persons
was
,
that
they
had
*NL*
been
appointed
by
the
king
,
the
one
to
his
bishopric
,
the
other
to
his
*NL*
benefice
,
on
the
same
day
,
the
27th
of
April
,
1785
.
Madame
Magloire
*NL*
having
taken
the
pictures
down
to
dust
,
the
Bishop
had
discovered
these
*NL*
particulars
written
in
whitish
ink
on
a
little
square
of
paper
,
yellowed
*NL*
by
time
,
and
attached
to
the
back
of
the
portrait
of
the
Abbe
of
*NL*
Grand-Champ
with
four
wafers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
window
he
had
an
antique
curtain
of
a
coarse
woollen
stuff
,
which
*NL*
finally
became
so
old
,
that
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
expense
of
a
new
one
,
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
was
forced
to
take
a
large
seam
in
the
very
middle
*NL*
of
it
.
This
seam
took
the
form
of
a
cross
.
The
Bishop
often
called
*NL*
attention
to
it
:
``
How
delightful
that
is
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
rooms
in
the
house
,
without
exception
,
those
on
the
ground
*NL*
floor
as
well
as
those
on
the
first
floor
,
were
white-washed
,
which
is
a
*NL*
fashion
in
barracks
and
hospitals
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
in
their
latter
years
,
Madame
Magloire
discovered
beneath
the
*NL*
paper
which
had
been
washed
over
,
paintings
,
ornamenting
the
apartment
*NL*
of
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
,
as
we
shall
see
further
on
.
Before
becoming
*NL*
a
hospital
,
this
house
had
been
the
ancient
parliament
house
of
the
*NL*
Bourgeois
.
Hence
this
decoration
.
The
chambers
were
paved
in
red
bricks
,
*NL*
which
were
washed
every
week
,
with
straw
mats
in
front
of
all
the
beds
.
*NL*
Altogether
,
this
dwelling
,
which
was
attended
to
by
the
two
women
,
was
*NL*
exquisitely
clean
from
top
to
bottom
.
This
was
the
sole
luxury
which
the
*NL*
Bishop
permitted
.
He
said
,
``
That
takes
nothing
from
the
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
confessed
,
however
,
that
he
still
retained
from
his
former
*NL*
possessions
six
silver
knives
and
forks
and
a
soup-ladle
,
which
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
contemplated
every
day
with
delight
,
as
they
glistened
*NL*
splendidly
upon
the
coarse
linen
cloth
.
And
since
we
are
now
painting
*NL*
the
Bishop
of
D
--
as
he
was
in
reality
,
we
must
add
that
he
had
said
*NL*
more
than
once
,
``
I
find
it
difficult
to
renounce
eating
from
silver
*NL*
dishes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
silverware
must
be
added
two
large
candlesticks
of
massive
*NL*
silver
,
which
he
had
inherited
from
a
great-aunt
.
These
candlesticks
*NL*
held
two
wax
candles
,
and
usually
figured
on
the
Bishop
's
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
When
he
had
any
one
to
dinner
,
Madame
Magloire
lighted
the
two
candles
*NL*
and
set
the
candlesticks
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Bishop
's
own
chamber
,
at
the
head
of
his
bed
,
there
was
a
small
*NL*
cupboard
,
in
which
Madame
Magloire
locked
up
the
six
silver
knives
and
*NL*
forks
and
the
big
spoon
every
night
.
But
it
is
necessary
to
add
,
that
*NL*
the
key
was
never
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
,
which
had
been
rather
spoiled
by
the
ugly
buildings
which
*NL*
we
have
mentioned
,
was
composed
of
four
alleys
in
cross-form
,
radiating
*NL*
from
a
tank
.
Another
walk
made
the
circuit
of
the
garden
,
and
skirted
*NL*
the
white
wall
which
enclosed
it
.
These
alleys
left
behind
them
four
*NL*
square
plots
rimmed
with
box
.
In
three
of
these
,
Madame
Magloire
*NL*
cultivated
vegetables
;
in
the
fourth
,
the
Bishop
had
planted
some
*NL*
flowers
;
here
and
there
stood
a
few
fruit-trees
.
Madame
Magloire
had
*NL*
once
remarked
,
with
a
sort
of
gentle
malice
:
``
Monseigneur
,
you
who
turn
*NL*
everything
to
account
,
have
,
nevertheless
,
one
useless
plot
.
It
would
be
*NL*
better
to
grow
salads
there
than
bouquets
.
''
``
Madame
Magloire
,
''
retorted
*NL*
the
Bishop
,
``
you
are
mistaken
.
The
beautiful
is
as
useful
as
the
*NL*
useful
.
''
He
added
after
a
pause
,
``
More
so
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
plot
,
consisting
of
three
or
four
beds
,
occupied
the
Bishop
*NL*
almost
as
much
as
did
his
books
.
He
liked
to
pass
an
hour
or
two
there
,
*NL*
trimming
,
hoeing
,
and
making
holes
here
and
there
in
the
earth
,
into
*NL*
which
he
dropped
seeds
.
He
was
not
as
hostile
to
insects
as
a
gardener
*NL*
could
have
wished
to
see
him
.
Moreover
,
he
made
no
pretensions
to
*NL*
botany
;
he
ignored
groups
and
consistency
;
he
made
not
the
slightest
*NL*
effort
to
decide
between
Tournefort
and
the
natural
method
;
he
took
part
*NL*
neither
with
the
buds
against
the
cotyledons
,
nor
with
Jussieu
against
*NL*
Linnaeus
.
He
did
not
study
plants
;
he
loved
flowers
.
He
respected
*NL*
learned
men
greatly
;
he
respected
the
ignorant
still
more
;
and
,
without
*NL*
ever
failing
in
these
two
respects
,
he
watered
his
flower-beds
every
*NL*
summer
evening
with
a
tin
watering-pot
painted
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
had
not
a
single
door
which
could
be
locked
.
The
door
of
the
*NL*
dining-room
,
which
,
as
we
have
said
,
opened
directly
on
the
cathedral
*NL*
square
,
had
formerly
been
ornamented
with
locks
and
bolts
like
the
door
*NL*
of
a
prison
.
The
Bishop
had
had
all
this
ironwork
removed
,
and
this
door
*NL*
was
never
fastened
,
either
by
night
or
by
day
,
with
anything
except
the
*NL*
latch
.
All
that
the
first
passerby
had
to
do
at
any
hour
,
was
to
give
it
*NL*
a
push
.
At
first
,
the
two
women
had
been
very
much
tried
by
this
door
,
*NL*
which
was
never
fastened
,
but
Monsieur
de
D
--
had
said
to
them
,
``
Have
*NL*
bolts
put
on
your
rooms
,
if
that
will
please
you
.
''
They
had
ended
by
*NL*
sharing
his
confidence
,
or
by
at
least
acting
as
though
they
shared
it
.
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
alone
had
frights
from
time
to
time
.
As
for
the
Bishop
,
*NL*
his
thought
can
be
found
explained
,
or
at
least
indicated
,
in
the
three
*NL*
lines
which
he
wrote
on
the
margin
of
a
Bible
,
``
This
is
the
shade
of
*NL*
difference
:
the
door
of
the
physician
should
never
be
shut
,
the
door
of
*NL*
the
priest
should
always
be
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
book
,
entitled
Philosophy
of
the
Medical
Science
,
he
had
*NL*
written
this
other
note
:
``
Am
not
I
a
physician
like
them
?
I
also
have
my
*NL*
patients
,
and
then
,
too
,
I
have
some
whom
I
call
my
unfortunates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
wrote
:
``
Do
not
inquire
the
name
of
him
who
asks
a
shelter
of
*NL*
you
.
The
very
man
who
is
embarrassed
by
his
name
is
the
one
who
needs
*NL*
shelter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
a
worthy
cure
,
I
know
not
whether
it
was
the
cure
of
*NL*
Couloubroux
or
the
cure
of
Pompierry
,
took
it
into
his
head
to
ask
*NL*
him
one
day
,
probably
at
the
instigation
of
Madame
Magloire
,
whether
*NL*
Monsieur
was
sure
that
he
was
not
committing
an
indiscretion
,
to
a
*NL*
certain
extent
,
in
leaving
his
door
unfastened
day
and
night
,
at
the
*NL*
mercy
of
any
one
who
should
choose
to
enter
,
and
whether
,
in
short
,
*NL*
he
did
not
fear
lest
some
misfortune
might
occur
in
a
house
so
little
*NL*
guarded
.
The
Bishop
touched
his
shoulder
,
with
gentle
gravity
,
and
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
Nisi
Dominus
custodierit
domum
,
in
vanum
vigilant
qui
*NL*
custodiunt
eam
,
''
Unless
the
Lord
guard
the
house
,
in
vain
do
they
watch
*NL*
who
guard
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
spoke
of
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
fond
of
saying
,
``
There
is
a
bravery
of
the
priest
as
well
as
*NL*
the
bravery
of
a
colonel
of
dragoons
,
--
only
,
''
he
added
,
``
ours
must
be
*NL*
tranquil
.

*NL*

CHAPTER
VII
--
CRAVATTE
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
here
that
a
fact
falls
naturally
into
place
,
which
we
must
not
*NL*
omit
,
because
it
is
one
of
the
sort
which
show
us
best
what
sort
of
a
*NL*
man
the
Bishop
of
D
--
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
destruction
of
the
band
of
Gaspard
Bes
,
who
had
infested
the
*NL*
gorges
of
Ollioules
,
one
of
his
lieutenants
,
Cravatte
,
took
refuge
in
*NL*
the
mountains
.
He
concealed
himself
for
some
time
with
his
bandits
,
the
*NL*
remnant
of
Gaspard
Bes
's
troop
,
in
the
county
of
Nice
;
then
he
made
his
*NL*
way
to
Piedmont
,
and
suddenly
reappeared
in
France
,
in
the
vicinity
*NL*
of
Barcelonette
.
He
was
first
seen
at
Jauziers
,
then
at
Tuiles
.
He
hid
*NL*
himself
in
the
caverns
of
the
Joug-de-l'Aigle
,
and
thence
he
descended
*NL*
towards
the
hamlets
and
villages
through
the
ravines
of
Ubaye
and
*NL*
Ubayette
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
even
pushed
as
far
as
Embrun
,
entered
the
cathedral
one
night
,
*NL*
and
despoiled
the
sacristy
.
His
highway
robberies
laid
waste
the
*NL*
country-side
.
The
gendarmes
were
set
on
his
track
,
but
in
vain
.
He
*NL*
always
escaped
;
sometimes
he
resisted
by
main
force
.
He
was
a
bold
*NL*
wretch
.
In
the
midst
of
all
this
terror
the
Bishop
arrived
.
He
was
*NL*
making
his
circuit
to
Chastelar
.
The
mayor
came
to
meet
him
,
and
urged
*NL*
him
to
retrace
his
steps
.
Cravatte
was
in
possession
of
the
mountains
*NL*
as
far
as
Arche
,
and
beyond
;
there
was
danger
even
with
an
escort
;
it
*NL*
merely
exposed
three
or
four
unfortunate
gendarmes
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Therefore
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
I
intend
to
go
without
escort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
really
mean
that
,
Monseigneur
!
''
exclaimed
the
mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
mean
it
so
thoroughly
that
I
absolutely
refuse
any
gendarmes
,
and
*NL*
shall
set
out
in
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
you
will
not
do
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
exists
yonder
in
the
mountains
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
a
tiny
*NL*
community
no
bigger
than
that
,
which
I
have
not
seen
for
three
years
.
*NL*
They
are
my
good
friends
,
those
gentle
and
honest
shepherds
.
They
own
*NL*
one
goat
out
of
every
thirty
that
they
tend
.
They
make
very
pretty
*NL*
woollen
cords
of
various
colors
,
and
they
play
the
mountain
airs
on
*NL*
little
flutes
with
six
holes
.
They
need
to
be
told
of
the
good
God
now
*NL*
and
then
.
What
would
they
say
to
a
bishop
who
was
afraid
?
What
would
*NL*
they
say
if
I
did
not
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
brigands
,
Monseigneur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
I
must
think
of
that
.
You
are
right
.
I
may
*NL*
meet
them
.
They
,
too
,
need
to
be
told
of
the
good
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Monseigneur
,
there
is
a
band
of
them
!
A
flock
of
wolves
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
maire
,
it
may
be
that
it
is
of
this
very
flock
of
wolves
*NL*
that
Jesus
has
constituted
me
the
shepherd

Who
knows
the
ways
of
*NL*
Providence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
rob
you
,
Monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
kill
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
goodman
of
a
priest
,
who
passes
along
mumbling
his
prayers
?
Bah
!
*NL*
To
what
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mon
Dieu
!
what
if
you
should
meet
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
beg
alms
of
them
for
my

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not

In
the
name
of
Heaven
!
You
are
risking
your
*NL*
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
maire
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
is
that
really
all
?
I
am
not
in
*NL*
the
world
to
guard
my
own
life
,
but
to
guard
souls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
to
allow
him
to
do
as
he
pleased
.
He
set
out
,
accompanied
only
*NL*
by
a
child
who
offered
to
serve
as
a
guide
.
His
obstinacy
was
bruited
*NL*
about
the
country-side
,
and
caused
great
consternation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
take
neither
his
sister
nor
Madame
Magloire
.
He
traversed
the
*NL*
mountain
on
mule-back
,
encountered
no
one
,
and
arrived
safe
and
sound
*NL*
at
the
residence
of
his
``
good
friends
,
''
the
shepherds
.
He
remained
*NL*
there
for
a
fortnight
,
preaching
,
administering
the
sacrament
,
teaching
,
*NL*
exhorting
.
When
the
time
of
his
departure
approached
,
he
resolved
to
*NL*
chant
a
Te
Deum
pontifically
.
He
mentioned
it
to
the
cure
.
But
what
was
*NL*
to
be
done
?
There
were
no
episcopal
ornaments
.
They
could
only
place
at
*NL*
his
disposal
a
wretched
village
sacristy
,
with
a
few
ancient
chasubles
*NL*
of
threadbare
damask
adorned
with
imitation
lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
the
Bishop
.
``
Let
us
announce
our
Te
Deum
from
the
pulpit
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
Monsieur
le
Cure
.
Things
will
arrange
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
instituted
a
search
in
the
churches
of
the
neighborhood
.
All
the
*NL*
magnificence
of
these
humble
parishes
combined
would
not
have
sufficed
*NL*
to
clothe
the
chorister
of
a
cathedral
properly
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
thus
embarrassed
,
a
large
chest
was
brought
and
*NL*
deposited
in
the
presbytery
for
the
Bishop
,
by
two
unknown
horsemen
,
who
*NL*
departed
on
the
instant
.
The
chest
was
opened
;
it
contained
a
cope
of
*NL*
cloth
of
gold
,
a
mitre
ornamented
with
diamonds
,
an
archbishop
's
cross
,
*NL*
a
magnificent
crosier
,
--
all
the
pontifical
vestments
which
had
been
*NL*
stolen
a
month
previously
from
the
treasury
of
Notre
Dame
d'Embrun
.
In
*NL*
the
chest
was
a
paper
,
on
which
these
words
were
written
,
``
From
Cravatte
*NL*
to
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
I
say
that
things
would
come
right
of
themselves
?
''
said
the
*NL*
Bishop
.
Then
he
added
,
with
a
smile
,
``
To
him
who
contents
himself
with
*NL*
the
surplice
of
a
curate
,
God
sends
the
cope
of
an
archbishop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
murmured
the
cure
,
throwing
back
his
head
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
``
God
--
or
the
Devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
looked
steadily
at
the
cure
,
and
repeated
with
authority
,
*NL*
``
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
to
Chastelar
,
the
people
came
out
to
stare
at
him
as
at
*NL*
a
curiosity
,
all
along
the
road
.
At
the
priest
's
house
in
Chastelar
he
*NL*
rejoined
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
and
Madame
Magloire
,
who
were
waiting
*NL*
for
him
,
and
he
said
to
his
sister
:
``
Well
!
was
I
in
the
right
?
The
poor
*NL*
priest
went
to
his
poor
mountaineers
with
empty
hands
,
and
he
returns
*NL*
from
them
with
his
hands
full
.
I
set
out
bearing
only
my
faith
in
God
;
I
*NL*
have
brought
back
the
treasure
of
a
cathedral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
before
he
went
to
bed
,
he
said
again
:
``
Let
us
never
fear
*NL*
robbers
nor
murderers
.
Those
are
dangers
from
without
,
petty
dangers
.
*NL*
Let
us
fear
ourselves
.
Prejudices
are
the
real
robbers
;
vices
are
the
*NL*
real
murderers
.
The
great
dangers
lie
within
ourselves
.
What
matters
it
*NL*
what
threatens
our
head
or
our
purse
!
Let
us
think
only
of
that
which
*NL*
threatens
our
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
turning
to
his
sister
:
``
Sister
,
never
a
precaution
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
priest
,
against
his
fellow-man
.
That
which
his
fellow
does
,
God
*NL*
permits
.
Let
us
confine
ourselves
to
prayer
,
when
we
think
that
a
danger
*NL*
is
approaching
us
.
Let
us
pray
,
not
for
ourselves
,
but
that
our
brother
*NL*
may
not
fall
into
sin
on
our
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
such
incidents
were
rare
in
his
life
.
We
relate
those
of
which
*NL*
we
know
;
but
generally
he
passed
his
life
in
doing
the
same
things
at
*NL*
the
same
moment
.
One
month
of
his
year
resembled
one
hour
of
his
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
what
became
of
``
the
treasure
''
of
the
cathedral
of
Embrun
,
we
*NL*
should
be
embarrassed
by
any
inquiry
in
that
direction
.
It
consisted
of
*NL*
very
handsome
things
,
very
tempting
things
,
and
things
which
were
very
*NL*
well
adapted
to
be
stolen
for
the
benefit
of
the
unfortunate
.
Stolen
*NL*
they
had
already
been
elsewhere
.
Half
of
the
adventure
was
completed
;
it
*NL*
only
remained
to
impart
a
new
direction
to
the
theft
,
and
to
cause
it
*NL*
to
take
a
short
trip
in
the
direction
of
the
poor
.
However
,
we
make
no
*NL*
assertions
on
this
point
.
Only
,
a
rather
obscure
note
was
found
among
*NL*
the
Bishop
's
papers
,
which
may
bear
some
relation
to
this
matter
,
and
*NL*
which
is
couched
in
these
terms
,
``
The
question
is
,
to
decide
whether
*NL*
this
should
be
turned
over
to
the
cathedral
or
to
the
hospital
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
PHILOSOPHY
AFTER
DRINKING
*NL*
*NL*
The
senator
above
mentioned
was
a
clever
man
,
who
had
made
his
own
way
,
*NL*
heedless
of
those
things
which
present
obstacles
,
and
which
are
called
*NL*
conscience
,
sworn
faith
,
justice
,
duty
:
he
had
marched
straight
to
his
*NL*
goal
,
without
once
flinching
in
the
line
of
his
advancement
and
his
*NL*
interest
.
He
was
an
old
attorney
,
softened
by
success
;
not
a
bad
man
by
*NL*
any
means
,
who
rendered
all
the
small
services
in
his
power
to
his
sons
,
*NL*
his
sons-in-law
,
his
relations
,
and
even
to
his
friends
,
having
wisely
*NL*
seized
upon
,
in
life
,
good
sides
,
good
opportunities
,
good
windfalls
.
*NL*
Everything
else
seemed
to
him
very
stupid
.
He
was
intelligent
,
and
just
*NL*
sufficiently
educated
to
think
himself
a
disciple
of
Epicurus
;
while
he
*NL*
was
,
in
reality
,
only
a
product
of
Pigault-Lebrun
.
He
laughed
willingly
*NL*
and
pleasantly
over
infinite
and
eternal
things
,
and
at
the
``
Crotchets
*NL*
of
that
good
old
fellow
the
Bishop
.
''
He
even
sometimes
laughed
at
him
*NL*
with
an
amiable
authority
in
the
presence
of
M.
Myriel
himself
,
who
*NL*
listened
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
some
semi-official
occasion
or
other
,
I
do
not
recollect
what
,
*NL*
Count
***
-LSB-
this
senator
-RSB-
and
M.
Myriel
were
to
dine
with
the
prefect
.
*NL*
At
dessert
,
the
senator
,
who
was
slightly
exhilarated
,
though
still
*NL*
perfectly
dignified
,
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Egad
,
Bishop
,
let
's
have
a
discussion
.
It
is
hard
for
a
senator
and
a
*NL*
bishop
to
look
at
each
other
without
winking
.
We
are
two
augurs
.
I
am
*NL*
going
to
make
a
confession
to
you
.
I
have
a
philosophy
of
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
right
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
.
``
As
one
makes
one
's
philosophy
,
*NL*
so
one
lies
on
it
.
You
are
on
the
bed
of
purple
,
senator
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
senator
was
encouraged
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
good
fellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
devils
even
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
to
you
,
''
continued
the
senator
,
``
that
the
Marquis
d'Argens
,
*NL*
Pyrrhon
,
Hobbes
,
and
M.
Naigeon
are
no
rascals
.
I
have
all
the
*NL*
philosophers
in
my
library
gilded
on
the
edges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
yourself
,
Count
,
''
interposed
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
senator
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
Diderot
;
he
is
an
ideologist
,
a
declaimer
,
and
a
revolutionist
,
*NL*
a
believer
in
God
at
bottom
,
and
more
bigoted
than
Voltaire
.
Voltaire
*NL*
made
sport
of
Needham
,
and
he
was
wrong
,
for
Needham
's
eels
prove
that
*NL*
God
is
useless
.
A
drop
of
vinegar
in
a
spoonful
of
flour
paste
supplies
*NL*
the
fiat
lux
.
Suppose
the
drop
to
be
larger
and
the
spoonful
bigger
;
*NL*
you
have
the
world
.
Man
is
the
eel
.
Then
what
is
the
good
of
the
Eternal
*NL*
Father
?
The
Jehovah
hypothesis
tires
me
,
Bishop
.
It
is
good
for
nothing
*NL*
but
to
produce
shallow
people
,
whose
reasoning
is
hollow
.
Down
with
that
*NL*
great
All
,
which
torments
me
!
Hurrah
for
Zero
which
leaves
me
in
peace
!
*NL*
Between
you
and
me
,
and
in
order
to
empty
my
sack
,
and
make
confession
*NL*
to
my
pastor
,
as
it
behooves
me
to
do
,
I
will
admit
to
you
that
I
*NL*
have
good
sense
.
I
am
not
enthusiastic
over
your
Jesus
,
who
preaches
*NL*
renunciation
and
sacrifice
to
the
last
extremity
.
'T
is
the
counsel
of
an
*NL*
avaricious
man
to
beggars
.
Renunciation
;
why
?
Sacrifice
;
to
what
end
?
*NL*
I
do
not
see
one
wolf
immolating
himself
for
the
happiness
of
another
*NL*
wolf
.
Let
us
stick
to
nature
,
then
.
We
are
at
the
top
;
let
us
have
a
*NL*
superior
philosophy
.
What
is
the
advantage
of
being
at
the
top
,
if
*NL*
one
sees
no
further
than
the
end
of
other
people
's
noses
?
Let
us
live
*NL*
merrily
.
Life
is
all
.
That
man
has
another
future
elsewhere
,
on
high
,
*NL*
below
,
anywhere
,
I
do
n't
believe
;
not
one
single
word
of
it
.
Ah
!
*NL*
sacrifice
and
renunciation
are
recommended
to
me
;
I
must
take
heed
to
*NL*
everything
I
do
;
I
must
cudgel
my
brains
over
good
and
evil
,
over
the
*NL*
just
and
the
unjust
,
over
the
fas
and
the
nefas
.
Why
?
Because
I
shall
*NL*
have
to
render
an
account
of
my
actions
.
When
?
After
death
.
What
a
fine
*NL*
dream
!
After
my
death
it
will
be
a
very
clever
person
who
can
catch
me
.
*NL*
Have
a
handful
of
dust
seized
by
a
shadow-hand
,
if
you
can
.
Let
us
tell
*NL*
the
truth
,
we
who
are
initiated
,
and
who
have
raised
the
veil
of
Isis
:
*NL*
there
is
no
such
thing
as
either
good
or
evil
;
there
is
vegetation
.
*NL*
Let
us
seek
the
real
.
Let
us
get
to
the
bottom
of
it
.
Let
us
go
into
it
*NL*
thoroughly
.
What
the
deuce
!
let
us
go
to
the
bottom
of
it
!
We
must
scent
*NL*
out
the
truth
;
dig
in
the
earth
for
it
,
and
seize
it
.
Then
it
gives
you
*NL*
exquisite
joys
.
Then
you
grow
strong
,
and
you
laugh
.
I
am
square
on
the
*NL*
bottom
,
I
am
.
Immortality
,
Bishop
,
is
a
chance
,
a
waiting
for
dead
men
's
*NL*
shoes
.
Ah
!
what
a
charming
promise
!
trust
to
it
,
if
you
like
!
What
a
*NL*
fine
lot
Adam
has
!
We
are
souls
,
and
we
shall
be
angels
,
with
blue
wings
*NL*
on
our
shoulder-blades
.
Do
come
to
my
assistance
:
is
it
not
Tertullian
*NL*
who
says
that
the
blessed
shall
travel
from
star
to
star
?
Very
well
.
We
*NL*
shall
be
the
grasshoppers
of
the
stars
.
And
then
,
besides
,
we
shall
*NL*
see
God
.
Ta
,
ta
,
ta
!
What
twaddle
all
these
paradises
are
!
God
is
a
*NL*
nonsensical
monster
.
I
would
not
say
that
in
the
Moniteur
,
egad
!
but
I
*NL*
may
whisper
it
among
friends
.
Inter
pocula
.
To
sacrifice
the
world
to
*NL*
paradise
is
to
let
slip
the
prey
for
the
shadow
.
Be
the
dupe
of
the
*NL*
infinite
!
I
'm
not
such
a
fool
.
I
am
a
nought
.
I
call
myself
Monsieur
le
*NL*
Comte
Nought
,
senator
.
Did
I
exist
before
my
birth
?
No
.
Shall
I
exist
*NL*
after
death
?
No
.
What
am
I
?
A
little
dust
collected
in
an
organism
.
What
*NL*
am
I
to
do
on
this
earth
?
The
choice
rests
with
me
:
suffer
or
enjoy
.
*NL*
Whither
will
suffering
lead
me
?
To
nothingness
;
but
I
shall
have
*NL*
suffered
.
Whither
will
enjoyment
lead
me
?
To
nothingness
;
but
I
shall
*NL*
have
enjoyed
myself
.
My
choice
is
made
.
One
must
eat
or
be
eaten
.
I
*NL*
shall
eat
.
It
is
better
to
be
the
tooth
than
the
grass
.
Such
is
my
*NL*
wisdom
.
After
which
,
go
whither
I
push
thee
,
the
grave-digger
is
there
;
*NL*
the
Pantheon
for
some
of
us
:
all
falls
into
the
great
hole
.
End
.
Finis
.
*NL*
Total
liquidation
.
This
is
the
vanishing-point
.
Death
is
death
,
believe
*NL*
me
.
I
laugh
at
the
idea
of
there
being
any
one
who
has
anything
to
tell
*NL*
me
on
that
subject
.
Fables
of
nurses
;
bugaboo
for
children
;
Jehovah
for
*NL*
men
.
No
;
our
to-morrow
is
the
night
.
Beyond
the
tomb
there
is
nothing
*NL*
but
equal
nothingness
.
You
have
been
Sardanapalus
,
you
have
been
Vincent
*NL*
de
Paul
--
it
makes
no
difference
.
That
is
the
truth
.
Then
live
your
life
,
*NL*
above
all
things
.
Make
use
of
your
_
I
_
while
you
have
it
.
In
truth
,
*NL*
Bishop
,
I
tell
you
that
I
have
a
philosophy
of
my
own
,
and
I
have
my
*NL*
philosophers
.
I
do
n't
let
myself
be
taken
in
with
that
nonsense
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
there
must
be
something
for
those
who
are
down
,
--
for
the
*NL*
barefooted

wretches

Legends

*NL*
chimeras
,
the
soul
,
immortality
,
paradise
,
the
stars
,
are
provided
for
*NL*
them
to
swallow
.
They
gobble
it
down
.
They
spread
it
on
their
dry
bread
.
*NL*
He
who
has
nothing
else
has
the
good
.
God
.
That
is
the
least
he
can
*NL*
have
.
I
oppose
no
objection
to
that
;
but
I
reserve
Monsieur
Naigeon
for
*NL*
myself
.
The
good
God
is
good
for
the
populace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
clapped
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
talking
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
What
an
excellent
and
really
marvellous
*NL*
thing
is
this
materialism
!
Not
every
one
who
wants
it
can
have
it
.
Ah
!
*NL*
when
one
does
have
it
,
one
is
no
longer
a
dupe
,
one
does
not
stupidly
*NL*
allow
one
's
self
to
be
exiled
like
Cato
,
nor
stoned
like
Stephen
,
nor
*NL*
burned
alive
like
Jeanne
d'Arc
.
Those
who
have
succeeded
in
procuring
*NL*
this
admirable
materialism
have
the
joy
of
feeling
themselves
*NL*
irresponsible
,
and
of
thinking
that
they
can
devour
everything
without
*NL*
uneasiness
,
--
places
,
sinecures
,
dignities
,
power
,
whether
well
or
*NL*
ill
acquired
,
lucrative
recantations
,
useful
treacheries
,
savory
*NL*
capitulations
of
conscience
,
--
and
that
they
shall
enter
the
tomb
with
*NL*
their
digestion
accomplished
.
How
agreeable
that
is
!
I
do
not
say
that
*NL*
with
reference
to
you
,
senator
.
Nevertheless
,
it
is
impossible
for
me
*NL*
to
refrain
from
congratulating
you
.
You
great
lords
have
,
so
you
say
,
a
*NL*
philosophy
of
your
own
,
and
for
yourselves
,
which
is
exquisite
,
refined
,
*NL*
accessible
to
the
rich
alone
,
good
for
all
sauces
,
and
which
seasons
*NL*
the
voluptuousness
of
life
admirably
.
This
philosophy
has
been
*NL*
extracted
from
the
depths
,
and
unearthed
by
special
seekers
.
But
you
are
*NL*
good-natured
princes
,
and
you
do
not
think
it
a
bad
thing
that
belief
in
*NL*
the
good
God
should
constitute
the
philosophy
of
the
people
,
very
much
*NL*
as
the
goose
stuffed
with
chestnuts
is
the
truffled
turkey
of
the
poor

CHAPTER
IX
--
THE
BROTHER
AS
DEPICTED
BY
THE
SISTER
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
furnish
an
idea
of
the
private
establishment
of
the
*NL*
Bishop
of
D
--
,
and
of
the
manner
in
which
those
two
sainted
women
*NL*
subordinated
their
actions
,
their
thoughts
,
their
feminine
instincts
*NL*
even
,
which
are
easily
alarmed
,
to
the
habits
and
purposes
of
the
*NL*
Bishop
,
without
his
even
taking
the
trouble
of
speaking
in
order
to
*NL*
explain
them
,
we
can
not
do
better
than
transcribe
in
this
place
a
letter
*NL*
from
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
to
Madame
the
Vicomtess
de
Boischevron
,
the
*NL*
friend
of
her
childhood
.
This
letter
is
in
our
possession
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
D
--
,
Dec.
16
,

--
.
*NL*
MY
GOOD
MADAM
:
Not
a
day
passes
without
our
speaking
of
you
.
It
is
our
*NL*
established
custom
;
but
there
is
another
reason
besides
.
Just
imagine
,
*NL*
while
washing
and
dusting
the
ceilings
and
walls
,
Madam
Magloire
has
*NL*
made
some
discoveries
;
now
our
two
chambers
hung
with
antique
paper
*NL*
whitewashed
over
,
would
not
discredit
a
chateau
in
the
style
of
yours
.
*NL*
Madam
Magloire
has
pulled
off
all
the
paper
.
There
were
things
beneath
.
*NL*
My
drawing-room
,
which
contains
no
furniture
,
and
which
we
use
for
*NL*
spreading
out
the
linen
after
washing
,
is
fifteen
feet
in
height
,
*NL*
eighteen
square
,
with
a
ceiling
which
was
formerly
painted
and
gilded
,
*NL*
and
with
beams
,
as
in
yours
.
This
was
covered
with
a
cloth
while
this
*NL*
was
the
hospital
.
And
the
woodwork
was
of
the
era
of
our
grandmothers
.
*NL*
But
my
room
is
the
one
you
ought
to
see
.
Madam
Magloire
has
discovered
,
*NL*
under
at
least
ten
thicknesses
of
paper
pasted
on
top
,
some
paintings
,
*NL*
which
without
being
good
are
very
tolerable
.
The
subject
is
Telemachus
*NL*
being
knighted
by
Minerva
in
some
gardens
,
the
name
of
which
escapes
*NL*
me
.
In
short
,
where
the
Roman
ladies
repaired
on
one
single
night
.
What
*NL*
shall
I
say
to
you
?
I
have
Romans
,
and
Roman
ladies
-LSB-
here
occurs
an
*NL*
illegible
word
-RSB-
,
and
the
whole
train
.
Madam
Magloire
has
cleaned
it
all
*NL*
off
;
this
summer
she
is
going
to
have
some
small
injuries
repaired
,
and
*NL*
the
whole
revarnished
,
and
my
chamber
will
be
a
regular
museum
.
She
has
*NL*
also
found
in
a
corner
of
the
attic
two
wooden
pier-tables
of
ancient
*NL*
fashion
.
They
asked
us
two
crowns
of
six
francs
each
to
regild
them
,
but
*NL*
it
is
much
better
to
give
the
money
to
the
poor
;
and
they
are
very
ugly
*NL*
besides
,
and
I
should
much
prefer
a
round
table
of
mahogany
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
always
very
happy
.
My
brother
is
so
good
.
He
gives
all
he
has
to
*NL*
the
poor
and
sick
.
We
are
very
much
cramped
.
The
country
is
trying
in
*NL*
the
winter
,
and
we
really
must
do
something
for
those
who
are
in
need
.
*NL*
We
are
almost
comfortably
lighted
and
warmed
.
You
see
that
these
are
*NL*
great
treats
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
brother
has
ways
of
his
own
.
When
he
talks
,
he
says
that
a
bishop
*NL*
ought
to
be
so
.
Just
imagine
!
the
door
of
our
house
is
never
fastened
.
*NL*
Whoever
chooses
to
enter
finds
himself
at
once
in
my
brother
's
room
.
He
*NL*
fears
nothing
,
even
at
night
.
That
is
his
sort
of
bravery
,
he
says
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
does
not
wish
me
or
Madame
Magloire
feel
any
fear
for
him
.
He
exposes
*NL*
himself
to
all
sorts
of
dangers
,
and
he
does
not
like
to
have
us
even
*NL*
seem
to
notice
it
.
One
must
know
how
to
understand
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
goes
out
in
the
rain
,
he
walks
in
the
water
,
he
travels
in
winter
.
He
*NL*
fears
neither
suspicious
roads
nor
dangerous
encounters
,
nor
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
year
he
went
quite
alone
into
a
country
of
robbers
.
He
would
*NL*
not
take
us
.
He
was
absent
for
a
fortnight
.
On
his
return
nothing
had
*NL*
happened
to
him
;
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
,
but
was
perfectly
well
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
This
is
the
way
I
have
been
robbed
!
''
And
then
he
opened
a
trunk
*NL*
full
of
jewels
,
all
the
jewels
of
the
cathedral
of
Embrun
,
which
the
*NL*
thieves
had
given
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
returned
on
that
occasion
,
I
could
not
refrain
from
scolding
him
*NL*
a
little
,
taking
care
,
however
,
not
to
speak
except
when
the
carriage
*NL*
was
making
a
noise
,
so
that
no
one
might
hear
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
I
used
to
say
to
myself
,
``
There
are
no
dangers
which
will
stop
*NL*
him
;
he
is
terrible
.
''
Now
I
have
ended
by
getting
used
to
it
.
I
make
a
*NL*
sign
to
Madam
Magloire
that
she
is
not
to
oppose
him
.
He
risks
himself
*NL*
as
he
sees
fit
.
I
carry
off
Madam
Magloire
,
I
enter
my
chamber
,
I
pray
*NL*
for
him
and
fall
asleep
.
I
am
at
ease
,
because
I
know
that
if
anything
*NL*
were
to
happen
to
him
,
it
would
be
the
end
of
me
.
I
should
go
to
the
*NL*
good
God
with
my
brother
and
my
bishop
.
It
has
cost
Madam
Magloire
*NL*
more
trouble
than
it
did
me
to
accustom
herself
to
what
she
terms
his
*NL*
imprudences
.
But
now
the
habit
has
been
acquired
.
We
pray
together
,
we
*NL*
tremble
together
,
and
we
fall
asleep
.
If
the
devil
were
to
enter
this
*NL*
house
,
he
would
be
allowed
to
do
so
.
After
all
,
what
is
there
for
us
*NL*
to
fear
in
this
house
?
There
is
always
some
one
with
us
who
is
stronger
*NL*
than
we
.
The
devil
may
pass
through
it
,
but
the
good
God
dwells
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
suffices
me
.
My
brother
has
no
longer
any
need
of
saying
a
word
to
*NL*
me
.
I
understand
him
without
his
speaking
,
and
we
abandon
ourselves
to
*NL*
the
care
of
Providence
.
That
is
the
way
one
has
to
do
with
a
man
who
*NL*
possesses
grandeur
of
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
interrogated
my
brother
with
regard
to
the
information
which
you
*NL*
desire
on
the
subject
of
the
Faux
family
.
You
are
aware
that
he
knows
*NL*
everything
,
and
that
he
has
memories
,
because
he
is
still
a
very
*NL*
good
royalist
.
They
really
are
a
very
ancient
Norman
family
of
the
*NL*
generalship
of
Caen
.
Five
hundred
years
ago
there
was
a
Raoul
de
Faux
,
a
*NL*
Jean
de
Faux
,
and
a
Thomas
de
Faux
,
who
were
gentlemen
,
and
one
of
whom
*NL*
was
a
seigneur
de
Rochefort
.
The
last
was
Guy-Etienne-Alexandre
,
and
was
*NL*
commander
of
a
regiment
,
and
something
in
the
light
horse
of
Bretagne
.
*NL*
His
daughter
,
Marie-Louise
,
married
Adrien-Charles
de
Gramont
,
son
of
*NL*
the
Duke
Louis
de
Gramont
,
peer
of
France
,
colonel
of
the
French
guards
,
*NL*
and
lieutenant-general
of
the
army
.
It
is
written
Faux
,
Fauq
,
and
*NL*
Faoucq
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
Madame
,
recommend
us
to
the
prayers
of
your
sainted
relative
,
*NL*
Monsieur
the
Cardinal
.
As
for
your
dear
Sylvanie
,
she
has
done
well
in
*NL*
not
wasting
the
few
moments
which
she
passes
with
you
in
writing
to
me
.
*NL*
She
is
well
,
works
as
you
would
wish
,
and
loves
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
all
that
I
desire
.
The
souvenir
which
she
sent
through
you
*NL*
reached
me
safely
,
and
it
makes
me
very
happy
.
My
health
is
not
so
very
*NL*
bad
,
and
yet
I
grow
thinner
every
day
.
Farewell
;
my
paper
is
at
an
end
,
*NL*
and
this
forces
me
to
leave
you
.
A
thousand
good
wishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
BAPTISTINE
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.S.
Your
grand
nephew
is
charming
.
Do
you
know
that
he
will
soon
be
*NL*
five
years
old
?
Yesterday
he
saw
some
one
riding
by
on
horseback
who
*NL*
had
on
knee-caps
,
and
he
said
,
``
What
has
he
got
on
his
knees
?
''
He
is
a
*NL*
charming
child
!
His
little
brother
is
dragging
an
old
broom
about
the
*NL*
room
,
like
a
carriage
,
and
saying
,
``
Hu
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
will
be
perceived
from
this
letter
,
these
two
women
understood
how
to
*NL*
mould
themselves
to
the
Bishop
's
ways
with
that
special
feminine
genius
*NL*
which
comprehends
the
man
better
than
he
comprehends
himself
.
The
Bishop
*NL*
of
D
--
,
in
spite
of
the
gentle
and
candid
air
which
never
deserted
*NL*
him
,
sometimes
did
things
that
were
grand
,
bold
,
and
magnificent
,
*NL*
without
seeming
to
have
even
a
suspicion
of
the
fact
.
They
trembled
,
but
*NL*
they
let
him
alone
.
Sometimes
Madame
Magloire
essayed
a
remonstrance
in
*NL*
advance
,
but
never
at
the
time
,
nor
afterwards
.
They
never
interfered
*NL*
with
him
by
so
much
as
a
word
or
sign
,
in
any
action
once
entered
upon
.
*NL*
At
certain
moments
,
without
his
having
occasion
to
mention
it
,
when
he
*NL*
was
not
even
conscious
of
it
himself
in
all
probability
,
so
perfect
was
*NL*
his
simplicity
,
they
vaguely
felt
that
he
was
acting
as
a
bishop
;
then
*NL*
they
were
nothing
more
than
two
shadows
in
the
house
.
They
served
him
*NL*
passively
;
and
if
obedience
consisted
in
disappearing
,
they
disappeared
.
*NL*
They
understood
,
with
an
admirable
delicacy
of
instinct
,
that
certain
*NL*
cares
may
be
put
under
constraint
.
Thus
,
even
when
believing
him
to
be
*NL*
in
peril
,
they
understood
,
I
will
not
say
his
thought
,
but
his
nature
,
*NL*
to
such
a
degree
that
they
no
longer
watched
over
him
.
They
confided
him
*NL*
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Baptistine
said
,
as
we
have
just
read
,
that
her
brother
's
end
*NL*
would
prove
her
own
.
Madame
Magloire
did
not
say
this
,
but
she
knew
it
.

CHAPTER
X
--
THE
BISHOP
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
AN
UNKNOWN
LIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
At
an
epoch
a
little
later
than
the
date
of
the
letter
cited
in
the
*NL*
preceding
pages
,
he
did
a
thing
which
,
if
the
whole
town
was
to
be
*NL*
believed
,
was
even
more
hazardous
than
his
trip
across
the
mountains
*NL*
infested
with
bandits
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
country
near
D
--
a
man
lived
quite
alone
.
This
man
,
we
will
*NL*
state
at
once
,
was
a
former
member
of
the
Convention
.
His
name
was
G
--
*NL*
*NL*
Member
of
the
Convention
,
G
--
was
mentioned
with
a
sort
of
horror
in
*NL*
the
little
world
of
D
--
A
member
of
the
Convention
--
can
you
imagine
*NL*
such
a
thing
?
That
existed
from
the
time
when
people
called
each
other
*NL*
thou
,
and
when
they
said
``
citizen
.
''
This
man
was
almost
a
monster
.
*NL*
He
had
not
voted
for
the
death
of
the
king
,
but
almost
.
He
was
a
*NL*
quasi-regicide
.
He
had
been
a
terrible
man
.
How
did
it
happen
that
such
*NL*
a
man
had
not
been
brought
before
a
provost
's
court
,
on
the
return
of
*NL*
the
legitimate
princes
?
They
need
not
have
cut
off
his
head
,
if
you
*NL*
please
;
clemency
must
be
exercised
,
agreed
;
but
a
good
banishment
for
*NL*
life
.
An
example
,
in
short
,
etc.
.
Besides
,
he
was
an
atheist
,
like
all
*NL*
the
rest
of
those
people
.
Gossip
of
the
geese
about
the
vulture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
G
--
a
vulture
after
all
?
Yes
;
if
he
were
to
be
judged
by
the
*NL*
element
of
ferocity
in
this
solitude
of
his
.
As
he
had
not
voted
for
the
*NL*
death
of
the
king
,
he
had
not
been
included
in
the
decrees
of
exile
,
and
*NL*
had
been
able
to
remain
in
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dwelt
at
a
distance
of
three-quarters
of
an
hour
from
the
city
,
far
*NL*
from
any
hamlet
,
far
from
any
road
,
in
some
hidden
turn
of
a
very
wild
*NL*
valley
,
no
one
knew
exactly
where
.
He
had
there
,
it
was
said
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
field
,
a
hole
,
a
lair
.
There
were
no
neighbors
,
not
even
passers-by
.
*NL*
Since
he
had
dwelt
in
that
valley
,
the
path
which
led
thither
had
*NL*
disappeared
under
a
growth
of
grass
.
The
locality
was
spoken
of
as
*NL*
though
it
had
been
the
dwelling
of
a
hangman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
Bishop
meditated
on
the
subject
,
and
from
time
to
time
*NL*
he
gazed
at
the
horizon
at
a
point
where
a
clump
of
trees
marked
the
*NL*
valley
of
the
former
member
of
the
Convention
,
and
he
said
,
``
There
is
a
*NL*
soul
yonder
which
is
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
,
deep
in
his
own
mind
,
``
I
owe
him
a
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
let
us
avow
it
,
this
idea
,
which
seemed
natural
at
the
first
blush
,
*NL*
appeared
to
him
after
a
moment
's
reflection
,
as
strange
,
impossible
,
and
*NL*
almost
repulsive
.
For
,
at
bottom
,
he
shared
the
general
impression
,
and
*NL*
the
old
member
of
the
Convention
inspired
him
,
without
his
being
clearly
*NL*
conscious
of
the
fact
himself
,
with
that
sentiment
which
borders
on
*NL*
hate
,
and
which
is
so
well
expressed
by
the
word
estrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
should
the
scab
of
the
sheep
cause
the
shepherd
to
recoil
?
No
.
*NL*
But
what
a
sheep
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
Bishop
was
perplexed
.
Sometimes
he
set
out
in
that
direction
;
*NL*
then
he
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
the
rumor
one
day
spread
through
the
town
that
a
sort
of
young
*NL*
shepherd
,
who
served
the
member
of
the
Convention
in
his
hovel
,
had
come
*NL*
in
quest
of
a
doctor
;
that
the
old
wretch
was
dying
,
that
paralysis
was
*NL*
gaining
on
him
,
and
that
he
would
not
live
over
night
.
--
``
Thank
God
!
''
*NL*
some
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
took
his
staff
,
put
on
his
cloak
,
on
account
of
his
too
*NL*
threadbare
cassock
,
as
we
have
mentioned
,
and
because
of
the
evening
*NL*
breeze
which
was
sure
to
rise
soon
,
and
set
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
setting
,
and
had
almost
touched
the
horizon
when
the
Bishop
*NL*
arrived
at
the
excommunicated
spot
.
With
a
certain
beating
of
the
heart
,
*NL*
he
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
near
the
lair
.
He
strode
over
a
*NL*
ditch
,
leaped
a
hedge
,
made
his
way
through
a
fence
of
dead
boughs
,
*NL*
entered
a
neglected
paddock
,
took
a
few
steps
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
boldness
,
and
suddenly
,
at
the
extremity
of
the
waste
land
,
and
behind
*NL*
lofty
brambles
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
cavern
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
low
hut
,
poor
,
small
,
and
clean
,
with
a
vine
nailed
*NL*
against
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
door
,
in
an
old
wheel-chair
,
the
arm-chair
of
the
peasants
,
*NL*
there
was
a
white-haired
man
,
smiling
at
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
seated
man
stood
a
young
boy
,
the
shepherd
lad
.
He
was
offering
*NL*
the
old
man
a
jar
of
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
Bishop
was
watching
him
,
the
old
man
spoke
:
``
Thank
you
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
I
need
nothing
.
''
And
his
smile
quitted
the
sun
to
rest
upon
the
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
stepped
forward
.
At
the
sound
which
he
made
in
walking
,
the
*NL*
old
man
turned
his
head
,
and
his
face
expressed
the
sum
total
of
the
*NL*
surprise
which
a
man
can
still
feel
after
a
long
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
time
since
I
have
been
here
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
any
one
*NL*
has
entered
here
.
Who
are
you
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Bienvenu
Myriel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bienvenu
Myriel
?
I
have
heard
that
name
.
Are
you
the
man
whom
the
*NL*
people
call
Monseigneur
Welcome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
resumed
with
a
half-smile
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
you
are
my
bishop
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enter
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
member
of
the
Convention
extended
his
hand
to
the
Bishop
,
but
the
*NL*
Bishop
did
not
take
it
.
The
Bishop
confined
himself
to
the
remark
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
pleased
to
see
that
I
have
been
misinformed
.
You
certainly
do
not
*NL*
seem
to
me
to
be
ill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
old
man
,
``
I
am
going
to
recover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
then
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
die
three
hours
hence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
something
of
a
doctor
;
I
know
in
what
fashion
the
last
hour
draws
*NL*
on
.
Yesterday
,
only
my
feet
were
cold
;
to-day
,
the
chill
has
ascended
to
*NL*
my
knees
;
now
I
feel
it
mounting
to
my
waist
;
when
it
reaches
the
heart
,
*NL*
I
shall
stop
.
The
sun
is
beautiful
,
is
it
not
?
I
had
myself
wheeled
*NL*
out
here
to
take
a
last
look
at
things
.
You
can
talk
to
me
;
it
does
not
*NL*
fatigue
me
.
You
have
done
well
to
come
and
look
at
a
man
who
is
on
*NL*
the
point
of
death
.
It
is
well
that
there
should
be
witnesses
at
that
*NL*
moment
.
One
has
one
's
caprices
;
I
should
have
liked
to
last
until
the
*NL*
dawn
,
but
I
know
that
I
shall
hardly
live
three
hours
.
It
will
be
night
*NL*
then
.
What
does
it
matter
,
after
all
?
Dying
is
a
simple
affair
.
One
has
*NL*
no
need
of
the
light
for
that
.
So
be
it
.
I
shall
die
by
starlight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
turned
to
the
shepherd
lad
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
thy
bed
;
thou
wert
awake
all
last
night
;
thou
art
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
entered
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
added
,
as
though
speaking
to
*NL*
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
die
while
he
sleeps
.
The
two
slumbers
may
be
good
neighbors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
was
not
touched
as
it
seems
that
he
should
have
been
.
He
*NL*
did
not
think
he
discerned
God
in
this
manner
of
dying
;
let
us
say
the
*NL*
whole
,
for
these
petty
contradictions
of
great
hearts
must
be
indicated
*NL*
like
the
rest
:
he
,
who
on
occasion
,
was
so
fond
of
laughing
at
``
His
*NL*
Grace
,
''
was
rather
shocked
at
not
being
addressed
as
Monseigneur
,
and
he
*NL*
was
almost
tempted
to
retort
``
citizen
.
''
He
was
assailed
by
a
fancy
for
*NL*
peevish
familiarity
,
common
enough
to
doctors
and
priests
,
but
which
*NL*
was
not
habitual
with
him
.
This
man
,
after
all
,
this
member
of
the
*NL*
Convention
,
this
representative
of
the
people
,
had
been
one
of
the
*NL*
powerful
ones
of
the
earth
;
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
probably
,
*NL*
the
Bishop
felt
in
a
mood
to
be
severe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
member
of
the
Convention
had
been
surveying
him
with
a
*NL*
modest
cordiality
,
in
which
one
could
have
distinguished
,
possibly
,
that
*NL*
humility
which
is
so
fitting
when
one
is
on
the
verge
of
returning
to
*NL*
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
,
on
his
side
,
although
he
generally
restrained
his
curiosity
,
*NL*
which
,
in
his
opinion
,
bordered
on
a
fault
,
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
examining
the
member
of
the
Convention
with
an
attention
which
,
as
it
*NL*
did
not
have
its
course
in
sympathy
,
would
have
served
his
conscience
as
*NL*
a
matter
of
reproach
,
in
connection
with
any
other
man
.
A
member
of
the
*NL*
Convention
produced
on
him
somewhat
the
effect
of
being
outside
the
pale
*NL*
of
the
law
,
even
of
the
law
of
charity
.
G
--
,
calm
,
his
body
almost
*NL*
upright
,
his
voice
vibrating
,
was
one
of
those
octogenarians
who
form
*NL*
the
subject
of
astonishment
to
the
physiologist
.
The
Revolution
had
*NL*
many
of
these
men
,
proportioned
to
the
epoch
.
In
this
old
man
one
was
*NL*
conscious
of
a
man
put
to
the
proof
.
Though
so
near
to
his
end
,
he
*NL*
preserved
all
the
gestures
of
health
.
In
his
clear
glance
,
in
his
firm
*NL*
tone
,
in
the
robust
movement
of
his
shoulders
,
there
was
something
*NL*
calculated
to
disconcert
death
.
Azrael
,
the
Mohammedan
angel
of
the
*NL*
sepulchre
,
would
have
turned
back
,
and
thought
that
he
had
mistaken
*NL*
the
door
.
G
--
seemed
to
be
dying
because
he
willed
it
so
.
There
was
*NL*
freedom
in
his
agony
.
His
legs
alone
were
motionless
.
It
was
there
that
*NL*
the
shadows
held
him
fast
.
His
feet
were
cold
and
dead
,
but
his
head
*NL*
survived
with
all
the
power
of
life
,
and
seemed
full
of
light
.
G
--
,
*NL*
at
this
solemn
moment
,
resembled
the
king
in
that
tale
of
the
Orient
who
*NL*
was
flesh
above
and
marble
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stone
there
.
The
Bishop
sat
down
.
The
exordium
was
abrupt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
congratulate
you
,
''
said
he
,
in
the
tone
which
one
uses
for
a
*NL*
reprimand
.
``
You
did
not
vote
for
the
death
of
the
king
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
member
of
the
Convention
did
not
appear
to
notice
the
bitter
*NL*
meaning
underlying
the
words
``
after
all
.
''
He
replied
.
The
smile
had
*NL*
quite
disappeared
from
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
congratulate
me
too
much
,
sir
.
I
did
vote
for
the
death
of
the
*NL*
tyrant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
tone
of
austerity
answering
the
tone
of
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
to
say
?
''
resumed
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
to
say
that
man
has
a
tyrant
,
--
ignorance
.
I
voted
for
the
death
*NL*
of
that
tyrant
.
That
tyrant
engendered
royalty
,
which
is
authority
*NL*
falsely
understood
,
while
science
is
authority
rightly
understood
.
Man
*NL*
should
be
governed
only
by
science
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
conscience
,
''
added
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
same
thing
.
Conscience
is
the
quantity
of
innate
science
*NL*
which
we
have
within
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
listened
in
some
astonishment
to
this
language
,
*NL*
which
was
very
new
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
member
of
the
Convention
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
Louis
XVI
.
was
concerned
,
I
said
`
no
.
'
I
did
not
think
that
I
*NL*
had
the
right
to
kill
a
man
;
but
I
felt
it
my
duty
to
exterminate
evil
.
*NL*
I
voted
the
end
of
the
tyrant
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
end
of
prostitution
*NL*
for
woman
,
the
end
of
slavery
for
man
,
the
end
of
night
for
the
child
.
*NL*
In
voting
for
the
Republic
,
I
voted
for
that
.
I
voted
for
fraternity
,
*NL*
concord
,
the
dawn
.
I
have
aided
in
the
overthrow
of
prejudices
and
*NL*
errors
.
The
crumbling
away
of
prejudices
and
errors
causes
light
.
We
*NL*
have
caused
the
fall
of
the
old
world
,
and
the
old
world
,
that
vase
of
*NL*
miseries
,
has
become
,
through
its
upsetting
upon
the
human
race
,
an
urn
*NL*
of
joy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mixed
joy
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
say
troubled
joy
,
and
to-day
,
after
that
fatal
return
of
the
*NL*
past
,
which
is
called
1814
,
joy
which
has
disappeared
!
Alas
!
The
work
*NL*
was
incomplete
,
I
admit
:
we
demolished
the
ancient
regime
in
deeds
;
we
*NL*
were
not
able
to
suppress
it
entirely
in
ideas
.
To
destroy
abuses
is
not
*NL*
sufficient
;
customs
must
be
modified

The
mill
is
there
no
longer
;
the
*NL*
wind
is
still
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
demolished

It
may
be
of
use
to
demolish
,
but
I
distrust
a
*NL*
demolition
complicated
with
wrath

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Right
has
its
wrath
,
Bishop
;
and
the
wrath
of
right
is
an
element
of

progress

In
any
case
,
and
in
spite
of
whatever
may
be
said
,
the
French
*NL*
Revolution
is
the
most
important
step
of
the
human
race
since
the
advent
*NL*
of
Christ
.
Incomplete
,
it
may
be
,
but
sublime
.
It
set
free
all
the
*NL*
unknown
social
quantities
;
it
softened
spirits
,
it
calmed
,
appeased
,
*NL*
enlightened
;
it
caused
the
waves
of
civilization
to
flow
over
the
*NL*
earth

It
was
a
good
thing

The
French
Revolution
is
the
consecration
of

humanity

*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
could
not
refrain
from
murmuring
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
?
'
93
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
member
of
the
Convention
straightened
himself
up
in
his
chair
with
*NL*
an
almost
lugubrious
solemnity
,
and
exclaimed
,
so
far
as
a
dying
man
is
*NL*
capable
of
exclamation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
there
you
go
;
'
93
!
I
was
expecting
that
word
.
A
cloud
had
been
*NL*
forming
for
the
space
of
fifteen
hundred
years
;
at
the
end
of
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
years
it
burst
.
You
are
putting
the
thunderbolt
on
its
trial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
felt
,
without
,
perhaps
,
confessing
it
,
that
something
within
*NL*
him
had
suffered
extinction
.
Nevertheless
,
he
put
a
good
face
on
the
*NL*
matter
.
He
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
judge
speaks
in
the
name
of
justice
;
the
priest
speaks
in
the
name
*NL*
of
pity
,
which
is
nothing
but
a
more
lofty
justice
.
A
thunderbolt
should
*NL*
commit
no
error
.
''
And
he
added
,
regarding
the
member
of
the
Convention
*NL*
steadily
the
while
,
``
Louis
XVII
.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conventionary
stretched
forth
his
hand
and
grasped
the
Bishop
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Louis
XVII
.
!
let
us
see
.
For
whom
do
you
mourn
?
is
it
for
the
innocent
*NL*
child
?
very
good
;
in
that
case
I
mourn
with
you
.
Is
it
for
the
royal
*NL*
child
?
I
demand
time
for
reflection
.
To
me
,
the
brother
of
Cartouche
,
*NL*
an
innocent
child
who
was
hung
up
by
the
armpits
in
the
Place
de
Greve
,
*NL*
until
death
ensued
,
for
the
sole
crime
of
having
been
the
brother
*NL*
of
Cartouche
,
is
no
less
painful
than
the
grandson
of
Louis
XV.
,
an
*NL*
innocent
child
,
martyred
in
the
tower
of
the
Temple
,
for
the
sole
crime
*NL*
of
having
been
grandson
of
Louis
XV
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
I
like
not
this
conjunction
of
names
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cartouche
?
Louis
XV
.
?
To
which
of
the
two
do
you
object
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
momentary
silence
ensued
.
The
Bishop
almost
regretted
having
come
,
and
*NL*
yet
he
felt
vaguely
and
strangely
shaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conventionary
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Monsieur
Priest
,
you
love
not
the
crudities
of
the
true
.
Christ
*NL*
loved
them
.
He
seized
a
rod
and
cleared
out
the
Temple
.
His
scourge
,
*NL*
full
of
lightnings
,
was
a
harsh
speaker
of
truths
.
When
he
cried
,
*NL*
`
Sinite
parvulos
,
'
he
made
no
distinction
between
the
little
children
.
*NL*
It
would
not
have
embarrassed
him
to
bring
together
the
Dauphin
of
*NL*
Barabbas
and
the
Dauphin
of
Herod
.
Innocence
,
Monsieur
,
is
its
own
*NL*
crown
.
Innocence
has
no
need
to
be
a
highness
.
It
is
as
august
in
rags
*NL*
as
in
fleurs
de
lys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
the
Bishop
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
persist
,
''
continued
the
conventionary
G
--
``
You
have
mentioned
Louis

XVII

to
me

Let
us
come
to
an
understanding

Shall
we
weep
for
all
the
*NL*
innocent
,
all
martyrs
,
all
children
,
the
lowly
as
well
as
the
exalted
?
*NL*
I
agree
to
that
.
But
in
that
case
,
as
I
have
told
you
,
we
must
go
back
*NL*
further
than
'
93
,
and
our
tears
must
begin
before
Louis
XVII
.
I
will
*NL*
weep
with
you
over
the
children

kings

provided
that
you
will
weep

with
me
over
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
weep
for
all

''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Equally
!
''
exclaimed
conventionary
G

;
``
and
if
the
balance
must
*NL*
incline

let
it
be
on
the
side
of
the

They
have
been
suffering
*NL*
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
silence
ensued
.
The
conventionary
was
the
first
to
break
it
.
He
*NL*
raised
himself
on
one
elbow
,
took
a
bit
of
his
cheek
between
his
thumb
*NL*
and
his
forefinger
,
as
one
does
mechanically
when
one
interrogates
and
*NL*
judges
,
and
appealed
to
the
Bishop
with
a
gaze
full
of
all
the
forces
of
*NL*
the
death
agony
.
It
was
almost
an
explosion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
the
people
have
been
suffering
a
long
while
.
And
hold
!
that
*NL*
is
not
all
,
either
;
why
have
you
just
questioned
me
and
talked
to
me
*NL*
about
Louis
XVII
.
?
I
know
you
not
.
Ever
since
I
have
been
in
these
parts
*NL*
I
have
dwelt
in
this
enclosure
alone
,
never
setting
foot
outside
,
and
*NL*
seeing
no
one
but
that
child
who
helps
me
.
Your
name
has
reached
me
in
*NL*
a
confused
manner
,
it
is
true
,
and
very
badly
pronounced
,
I
must
admit
;
*NL*
but
that
signifies
nothing
:
clever
men
have
so
many
ways
of
imposing
on
*NL*
that
honest
goodman
,
the
people
.
By
the
way
,
I
did
not
hear
the
sound
of
*NL*
your
carriage
;
you
have
left
it
yonder
,
behind
the
coppice
at
the
fork
*NL*
of
the
roads
,
no
doubt
.
I
do
not
know
you
,
I
tell
you
.
You
have
told
me
*NL*
that
you
are
the
Bishop
;
but
that
affords
me
no
information
as
to
your
*NL*
moral
personality
.
In
short
,
I
repeat
my
question
.
Who
are
you
?
You
are
*NL*
a
bishop
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
prince
of
the
church
,
one
of
those
gilded
*NL*
men
with
heraldic
bearings
and
revenues
,
who
have
vast
prebends
,
--
the
*NL*
bishopric
of
D
--
fifteen
thousand
francs
settled
income
,
ten
thousand
*NL*
in
perquisites
;
total
,
twenty-five
thousand
francs
,
--
who
have
kitchens
,
*NL*
who
have
liveries
,
who
make
good
cheer
,
who
eat
moor-hens
on
Friday
,
who
*NL*
strut
about
,
a
lackey
before
,
a
lackey
behind
,
in
a
gala
coach
,
and
*NL*
who
have
palaces
,
and
who
roll
in
their
carriages
in
the
name
of
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
who
went
barefoot
!
You
are
a
prelate
,
--
revenues
,
palace
,
horses
,
*NL*
servants
,
good
table
,
all
the
sensualities
of
life
;
you
have
this
like
*NL*
the
rest
,
and
like
the
rest
,
you
enjoy
it
;
it
is
well
;
but
this
says
*NL*
either
too
much
or
too
little
;
this
does
not
enlighten
me
upon
the
*NL*
intrinsic
and
essential
value
of
the
man
who
comes
with
the
probable
*NL*
intention
of
bringing
wisdom
to
me
.
To
whom
do
I
speak
?
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
hung
his
head
and
replied
,
``
Vermis
sum
--
I
am
a
worm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
worm
of
the
earth
in
a
carriage
?
''
growled
the
conventionary
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
conventionary
's
turn
to
be
arrogant
,
and
the
Bishop
's
to
be
*NL*
humble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
resumed
mildly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
sir
.
But
explain
to
me
how
my
carriage
,
which
is
a
few
paces
*NL*
off
behind
the
trees
yonder
,
how
my
good
table
and
the
moor-hens
which
I
*NL*
eat
on
Friday
,
how
my
twenty-five
thousand
francs
income
,
how
my
palace
*NL*
and
my
lackeys
prove
that
clemency
is
not
a
duty
,
and
that
'93
was
not
*NL*
inexorable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conventionary
passed
his
hand
across
his
brow
,
as
though
to
sweep
*NL*
away
a
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
replying
to
you
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
beseech
you
to
pardon
me
.
I
have
*NL*
just
committed
a
wrong

sir

You
are
at
my
house
,
you
are
my
guest
,
I
*NL*
owe
you
courtesy
.
You
discuss
my
ideas
,
and
it
becomes
me
to
confine
*NL*
myself
to
combating
your
arguments
.
Your
riches
and
your
pleasures
are
*NL*
advantages
which
I
hold
over
you
in
the
debate
;
but
good
taste
dictates
*NL*
that
I
shall
not
make
use
of
them
.
I
promise
you
to
make
no
use
of
them
*NL*
in
the
future
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
G
--
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
return
to
the
explanation
which
you
have
asked
of
me
.
Where
were
*NL*
we
?
What
were
you
saying
to
me
?
That
'93
was
inexorable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inexorable
;
yes
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
``
What
think
you
of
Marat
clapping
*NL*
his
hands
at
the
guillotine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
think
you
of
Bossuet
chanting
the
Te
Deum
over
the
dragonnades
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
retort
was
a
harsh
one
,
but
it
attained
its
mark
with
the
directness
*NL*
of
a
point
of
steel
.
The
Bishop
quivered
under
it
;
no
reply
occurred
to
*NL*
him
;
but
he
was
offended
by
this
mode
of
alluding
to
Bossuet
.
The
best
*NL*
of
minds
will
have
their
fetiches
,
and
they
sometimes
feel
vaguely
*NL*
wounded
by
the
want
of
respect
of
logic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conventionary
began
to
pant
;
the
asthma
of
the
agony
which
is
*NL*
mingled
with
the
last
breaths
interrupted
his
voice
;
still
,
there
was
a
*NL*
perfect
lucidity
of
soul
in
his
eyes
.
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
say
a
few
words
more
in
this
and
that
direction
;
I
am
willing
.
*NL*
Apart
from
the
Revolution
,
which
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
is
an
immense
human
*NL*
affirmation
,
'93
is
,
alas
!
a
rejoinder
.
You
think
it
inexorable
,
sir
;
*NL*
but
what
of
the
whole
monarchy
,
sir
?
Carrier
is
a
bandit
;
but
what
name
*NL*
do
you
give
to
Montrevel
?
Fouquier-Tainville
is
a
rascal
;
but
what
*NL*
is
your
opinion
as
to
Lamoignon-Baville
?
Maillard
is
terrible
;
but
*NL*
Saulx-Tavannes
,
if
you
please
?
Duchene
senior
is
ferocious
;
but
what
*NL*
epithet
will
you
allow
me
for
the
elder
Letellier
?
Jourdan-Coupe-Tete
*NL*
is
a
monster
;
but
not
so
great
a
one
as
M.
the
Marquis
de
Louvois
.
Sir
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
am
sorry
for
Marie
Antoinette
,
archduchess
and
queen
;
but
I
am
*NL*
also
sorry
for
that
poor
Huguenot
woman
,
who
,
in
1685
,
under
Louis
the
*NL*
Great
,
sir
,
while
with
a
nursing
infant
,
was
bound
,
naked
to
the
waist
,
*NL*
to
a
stake
,
and
the
child
kept
at
a
distance
;
her
breast
swelled
with
*NL*
milk
and
her
heart
with
anguish
;
the
little
one
,
hungry
and
pale
,
beheld
*NL*
that
breast
and
cried
and
agonized
;
the
executioner
said
to
the
woman
,
a
*NL*
mother
and
a
nurse
,
`
Abjure
!
'
giving
her
her
choice
between
the
death
of
*NL*
her
infant
and
the
death
of
her
conscience
.
What
say
you
to
that
torture
*NL*
of
Tantalus
as
applied
to
a
mother
?
Bear
this
well
in
mind
sir
:
the
*NL*
French
Revolution
had
its
reasons
for
existence
;
its
wrath
will
be
*NL*
absolved
by
the
future
;
its
result
is
the
world
made
better
.
From
its
*NL*
most
terrible
blows
there
comes
forth
a
caress
for
the
human
race
.
I
*NL*
abridge
,
I
stop
,
I
have
too
much
the
advantage
;
moreover
,
I
am
dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
ceasing
to
gaze
at
the
Bishop
,
the
conventionary
concluded
his
*NL*
thoughts
in
these
tranquil
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
brutalities
of
progress
are
called
revolutions
.
When
they
are
*NL*
over
,
this
fact
is
recognized
,
--
that
the
human
race
has
been
treated
*NL*
harshly
,
but
that
it
has
progressed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conventionary
doubted
not
that
he
had
successively
conquered
all
the
*NL*
inmost
intrenchments
of
the
Bishop
.
One
remained
,
however
,
and
from
this
*NL*
intrenchment
,
the
last
resource
of
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
's
resistance
,
*NL*
came
forth
this
reply
,
wherein
appeared
nearly
all
the
harshness
of
the
*NL*
beginning
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Progress
should
believe
in
God
.
Good
can
not
have
an
impious
servitor
.
*NL*
He
who
is
an
atheist
is
but
a
bad
leader
for
the
human
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
former
representative
of
the
people
made
no
reply
.
He
was
seized
*NL*
with
a
fit
of
trembling
.
He
looked
towards
heaven
,
and
in
his
glance
a
*NL*
tear
gathered
slowly
.
When
the
eyelid
was
full
,
the
tear
trickled
down
*NL*
his
livid
cheek
,
and
he
said
,
almost
in
a
stammer
,
quite
low
,
and
to
*NL*
himself
,
while
his
eyes
were
plunged
in
the
depths
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
thou
!
O
ideal
!
Thou
alone
existest
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
experienced
an
indescribable
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
,
the
old
man
raised
a
finger
heavenward
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
infinite
is
.
He
is
there
.
If
the
infinite
had
no
person
,
person
*NL*
would
be
without
limit
;
it
would
not
be
infinite
;
in
other
words
,
it
*NL*
would
not
exist
.
There
is
,
then
,
an
_
I
_
.
That
_
I
_
of
the
infinite
is
*NL*
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dying
man
had
pronounced
these
last
words
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
with
*NL*
the
shiver
of
ecstasy
,
as
though
he
beheld
some
one
.
When
he
had
spoken
,
*NL*
his
eyes
closed
.
The
effort
had
exhausted
him
.
It
was
evident
that
he
*NL*
had
just
lived
through
in
a
moment
the
few
hours
which
had
been
left
to
*NL*
him
.
That
which
he
had
said
brought
him
nearer
to
him
who
is
in
death
.
*NL*
The
supreme
moment
was
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
understood
this
;
time
pressed
;
it
was
as
a
priest
that
he
had
*NL*
come
:
from
extreme
coldness
he
had
passed
by
degrees
to
extreme
emotion
;
*NL*
he
gazed
at
those
closed
eyes
,
he
took
that
wrinkled
,
aged
and
ice-cold
*NL*
hand
in
his
,
and
bent
over
the
dying
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
hour
is
the
hour
of
God
.
Do
you
not
think
that
it
would
be
*NL*
regrettable
if
we
had
met
in
vain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conventionary
opened
his
eyes
again
.
A
gravity
mingled
with
gloom
*NL*
was
imprinted
on
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bishop
,
''
said
he
,
with
a
slowness
which
probably
arose
more
from
his
*NL*
dignity
of
soul
than
from
the
failing
of
his
strength
,
``
I
have
passed
my
*NL*
life
in
meditation
,
study
,
and
contemplation
.
I
was
sixty
years
of
age
*NL*
when
my
country
called
me
and
commanded
me
to
concern
myself
with
its
*NL*
affairs
.
I
obeyed
.
Abuses
existed
,
I
combated
them
;
tyrannies
existed
,
*NL*
I
destroyed
them
;
rights
and
principles
existed
,
I
proclaimed
and
*NL*
confessed
them
.
Our
territory
was
invaded
,
I
defended
it
;
France
was
*NL*
menaced
,
I
offered
my
breast
.
I
was
not
rich
;
I
am
poor
.
I
have
been
one
*NL*
of
the
masters
of
the
state
;
the
vaults
of
the
treasury
were
encumbered
*NL*
with
specie
to
such
a
degree
that
we
were
forced
to
shore
up
the
walls
,
*NL*
which
were
on
the
point
of
bursting
beneath
the
weight
of
gold
and
*NL*
silver
;
I
dined
in
Dead
Tree
Street
,
at
twenty-two
sous
.
I
have
succored
*NL*
the
oppressed
,
I
have
comforted
the
suffering
.
I
tore
the
cloth
from
*NL*
the
altar
,
it
is
true
;
but
it
was
to
bind
up
the
wounds
of
my
country
.
I
*NL*
have
always
upheld
the
march
forward
of
the
human
race
,
forward
towards
*NL*
the
light
,
and
I
have
sometimes
resisted
progress
without
pity
.
I
have
,
*NL*
when
the
occasion
offered
,
protected
my
own
adversaries
,
men
of
your
*NL*
profession
.
And
there
is
at
Peteghem
,
in
Flanders
,
at
the
very
spot
*NL*
where
the
Merovingian
kings
had
their
summer
palace
,
a
convent
of
*NL*
Urbanists
,
the
Abbey
of
Sainte
Claire
en
Beaulieu
,
which
I
saved
in
*NL*
1793
.
I
have
done
my
duty
according
to
my
powers
,
and
all
the
good
*NL*
that
I
was
able
.
After
which
,
I
was
hunted
down
,
pursued
,
persecuted
,
*NL*
blackened
,
jeered
at
,
scorned
,
cursed
,
proscribed
.
For
many
years
past
,
*NL*
I
with
my
white
hair
have
been
conscious
that
many
people
think
they
*NL*
have
the
right
to
despise
me
;
to
the
poor
ignorant
masses
I
present
the
*NL*
visage
of
one
damned
.
And
I
accept
this
isolation
of
hatred
,
without
*NL*
hating
any
one
myself
.
Now
I
am
eighty-six
years
old
;
I
am
on
the
point
*NL*
of
death
.
What
is
it
that
you
have
come
to
ask
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
blessing
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
knelt
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Bishop
raised
his
head
again
,
the
face
of
the
conventionary
had
*NL*
become
august
.
He
had
just
expired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
returned
home
,
deeply
absorbed
in
thoughts
which
can
not
*NL*
be
known
to
us
.
He
passed
the
whole
night
in
prayer
.
On
the
following
*NL*
morning
some
bold
and
curious
persons
attempted
to
speak
to
him
about
*NL*
member
of
the
Convention
G
--
;
he
contented
himself
with
pointing
*NL*
heavenward
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
he
redoubled
his
tenderness
and
brotherly
feeling
*NL*
towards
all
children
and
sufferers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
allusion
to
``
that
old
wretch
of
a
G
--
''
caused
him
to
fall
into
a
*NL*
singular
preoccupation
.
No
one
could
say
that
the
passage
of
that
soul
*NL*
before
his
,
and
the
reflection
of
that
grand
conscience
upon
his
,
did
*NL*
not
count
for
something
in
his
approach
to
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
``
pastoral
visit
''
naturally
furnished
an
occasion
for
a
murmur
of
*NL*
comment
in
all
the
little
local
coteries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
the
bedside
of
such
a
dying
man
as
that
the
proper
place
for
a
*NL*
bishop
?
There
was
evidently
no
conversion
to
be
expected
.
All
those
*NL*
revolutionists
are
backsliders
.
Then
why
go
there
?
What
was
there
to
be
*NL*
seen
there
?
He
must
have
been
very
curious
indeed
to
see
a
soul
carried
*NL*
off
by
the
devil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
a
dowager
of
the
impertinent
variety
who
thinks
herself
*NL*
spiritual
,
addressed
this
sally
to
him
,
``
Monseigneur
,
people
are
*NL*
inquiring
when
Your
Greatness
will
receive
the
red
cap
!
''
--
``
Oh
!
oh
!
*NL*
that
's
a
coarse
color
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
.
``
It
is
lucky
that
those
who
*NL*
despise
it
in
a
cap
revere
it
in
a
hat
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
A
RESTRICTION
*NL*
*NL*
We
should
incur
a
great
risk
of
deceiving
ourselves
,
were
we
to
conclude
*NL*
from
this
that
Monseigneur
Welcome
was
``
a
philosophical
bishop
,
''
or
a
*NL*
``
patriotic
cure
.
''
His
meeting
,
which
may
almost
be
designated
as
his
*NL*
union
,
with
conventionary
G
--
,
left
behind
it
in
his
mind
a
sort
of
*NL*
astonishment
,
which
rendered
him
still
more
gentle
.
That
is
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
was
far
from
being
a
politician
,
this
is
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
the
place
to
indicate
very
briefly
what
his
attitude
was
in
the
*NL*
events
of
that
epoch
,
supposing
that
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
ever
dreamed
*NL*
of
having
an
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
,
then
,
go
back
a
few
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
the
elevation
of
M.
Myriel
to
the
episcopate
,
the
*NL*
Emperor
had
made
him
a
baron
of
the
Empire
,
in
company
with
many
other
*NL*
bishops
.
The
arrest
of
the
Pope
took
place
,
as
every
one
knows
,
on
the
*NL*
night
of
the
5th
to
the
6th
of
July
,
1809
;
on
this
occasion
,
M.
Myriel
*NL*
was
summoned
by
Napoleon
to
the
synod
of
the
bishops
of
France
and
Italy
*NL*
convened
at
Paris
.
This
synod
was
held
at
Notre-Dame
,
and
assembled
*NL*
for
the
first
time
on
the
15th
of
June
,
1811
,
under
the
presidency
*NL*
of
Cardinal
Fesch
.
M.
Myriel
was
one
of
the
ninety-five
bishops
who
*NL*
attended
it
.
But
he
was
present
only
at
one
sitting
and
at
three
or
four
*NL*
private
conferences
.
Bishop
of
a
mountain
diocese
,
living
so
very
close
*NL*
to
nature
,
in
rusticity
and
deprivation
,
it
appeared
that
he
imported
*NL*
among
these
eminent
personages
,
ideas
which
altered
the
temperature
of
*NL*
the
assembly
.
He
very
soon
returned
to
D
--
He
was
interrogated
as
to
*NL*
this
speedy
return
,
and
he
replied
:
``
I
embarrassed
them
.
The
outside
air
*NL*
penetrated
to
them
through
me
.
I
produced
on
them
the
effect
of
an
open
*NL*
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
he
said
,
``
What
would
you
have
?
Those
gentlemen
are
*NL*
princes
.
I
am
only
a
poor
peasant
bishop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
is
that
he
displeased
them
.
Among
other
strange
things
,
it
is
*NL*
said
that
he
chanced
to
remark
one
evening
,
when
he
found
himself
at
*NL*
the
house
of
one
of
his
most
notable
colleagues
:
``
What
beautiful
clocks
!
*NL*
What
beautiful
carpets
!
What
beautiful
liveries
!
They
must
be
a
great
*NL*
trouble
.
I
would
not
have
all
those
superfluities
,
crying
incessantly
*NL*
in
my
ears
:
`
There
are
people
who
are
hungry
!
There
are
people
who
are
*NL*
cold
!
There
are
poor
people
!
There
are
poor
people
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
remark
,
by
the
way
,
that
the
hatred
of
luxury
is
not
an
*NL*
intelligent
hatred
.
This
hatred
would
involve
the
hatred
of
the
arts
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
in
churchmen
,
luxury
is
wrong
,
except
in
connection
with
*NL*
representations
and
ceremonies
.
It
seems
to
reveal
habits
which
have
*NL*
very
little
that
is
charitable
about
them
.
An
opulent
priest
is
a
*NL*
contradiction
.
The
priest
must
keep
close
to
the
poor
.
Now
,
can
one
come
*NL*
in
contact
incessantly
night
and
day
with
all
this
distress
,
all
these
*NL*
misfortunes
,
and
this
poverty
,
without
having
about
one
's
own
person
a
*NL*
little
of
that
misery
,
like
the
dust
of
labor
?
Is
it
possible
to
imagine
*NL*
a
man
near
a
brazier
who
is
not
warm
?
Can
one
imagine
a
workman
who
is
*NL*
working
near
a
furnace
,
and
who
has
neither
a
singed
hair
,
nor
blackened
*NL*
nails
,
nor
a
drop
of
sweat
,
nor
a
speck
of
ashes
on
his
face
?
The
first
*NL*
proof
of
charity
in
the
priest
,
in
the
bishop
especially
,
is
poverty
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
,
no
doubt
,
what
the
Bishop
of
D
--
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
not
be
supposed
,
however
,
that
he
shared
what
we
call
the
``
ideas
*NL*
of
the
century
''
on
certain
delicate
points
.
He
took
very
little
part
*NL*
in
the
theological
quarrels
of
the
moment
,
and
maintained
silence
on
*NL*
questions
in
which
Church
and
State
were
implicated
;
but
if
he
had
*NL*
been
strongly
pressed
,
it
seems
that
he
would
have
been
found
to
be
an
*NL*
ultramontane
rather
than
a
gallican
.
Since
we
are
making
a
portrait
,
and
*NL*
since
we
do
not
wish
to
conceal
anything
,
we
are
forced
to
add
that
he
*NL*
was
glacial
towards
Napoleon
in
his
decline
.
Beginning
with
1813
,
he
*NL*
gave
in
his
adherence
to
or
applauded
all
hostile
manifestations
.
He
*NL*
refused
to
see
him
,
as
he
passed
through
on
his
return
from
the
island
*NL*
of
Elba
,
and
he
abstained
from
ordering
public
prayers
for
the
Emperor
*NL*
in
his
diocese
during
the
Hundred
Days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
his
sister
,
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
,
he
had
two
brothers
,
one
a
*NL*
general
,
the
other
a
prefect
.
He
wrote
to
both
with
tolerable
frequency
.
*NL*
He
was
harsh
for
a
time
towards
the
former
,
because
,
holding
a
command
*NL*
in
Provence
at
the
epoch
of
the
disembarkation
at
Cannes
,
the
general
*NL*
had
put
himself
at
the
head
of
twelve
hundred
men
and
had
pursued
the
*NL*
Emperor
as
though
the
latter
had
been
a
person
whom
one
is
desirous
*NL*
of
allowing
to
escape
.
His
correspondence
with
the
other
brother
,
the
*NL*
ex-prefect
,
a
fine
,
worthy
man
who
lived
in
retirement
at
Paris
,
Rue
*NL*
Cassette
,
remained
more
affectionate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
also
had
his
hour
of
party
spirit
,
his
hour
*NL*
of
bitterness
,
his
cloud
.
The
shadow
of
the
passions
of
the
moment
*NL*
traversed
this
grand
and
gentle
spirit
occupied
with
eternal
things
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
such
a
man
would
have
done
well
not
to
entertain
any
*NL*
political
opinions
.
Let
there
be
no
mistake
as
to
our
meaning
:
we
are
*NL*
not
confounding
what
is
called
``
political
opinions
''
with
the
grand
*NL*
aspiration
for
progress
,
with
the
sublime
faith
,
patriotic
,
democratic
,
*NL*
humane
,
which
in
our
day
should
be
the
very
foundation
of
every
generous
*NL*
intellect
.
Without
going
deeply
into
questions
which
are
only
indirectly
*NL*
connected
with
the
subject
of
this
book
,
we
will
simply
say
this
:
It
*NL*
would
have
been
well
if
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
had
not
been
a
Royalist
,
*NL*
and
if
his
glance
had
never
been
,
for
a
single
instant
,
turned
away
from
*NL*
that
serene
contemplation
in
which
is
distinctly
discernible
,
above
the
*NL*
fictions
and
the
hatreds
of
this
world
,
above
the
stormy
vicissitudes
of
*NL*
human
things
,
the
beaming
of
those
three
pure
radiances
,
truth
,
justice
,
*NL*
and
charity
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
admitting
that
it
was
not
for
a
political
office
that
God
created
*NL*
Monseigneur
Welcome
,
we
should
have
understood
and
admired
his
protest
*NL*
in
the
name
of
right
and
liberty
,
his
proud
opposition
,
his
just
but
*NL*
perilous
resistance
to
the
all-powerful
Napoleon
.
But
that
which
pleases
*NL*
us
in
people
who
are
rising
pleases
us
less
in
the
case
of
people
who
*NL*
are
falling
.
We
only
love
the
fray
so
long
as
there
is
danger
,
and
in
*NL*
any
case
,
the
combatants
of
the
first
hour
have
alone
the
right
to
be
*NL*
the
exterminators
of
the
last
.
He
who
has
not
been
a
stubborn
accuser
in
*NL*
prosperity
should
hold
his
peace
in
the
face
of
ruin
.
The
denunciator
of
*NL*
success
is
the
only
legitimate
executioner
of
the
fall
.
As
for
us
,
when
*NL*
Providence
intervenes
and
strikes
,
we
let
it
work
.
1812
commenced
to
*NL*
disarm
us
.
In
1813
the
cowardly
breach
of
silence
of
that
taciturn
*NL*
legislative
body
,
emboldened
by
catastrophe
,
possessed
only
traits
which
*NL*
aroused
indignation
.
And
it
was
a
crime
to
applaud
,
in
1814
,
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
those
marshals
who
betrayed
;
in
the
presence
of
that
senate
*NL*
which
passed
from
one
dunghill
to
another
,
insulting
after
having
*NL*
deified
;
in
the
presence
of
that
idolatry
which
was
loosing
its
footing
*NL*
and
spitting
on
its
idol
,
--
it
was
a
duty
to
turn
aside
the
head
.
In
*NL*
1815
,
when
the
supreme
disasters
filled
the
air
,
when
France
was
seized
*NL*
with
a
shiver
at
their
sinister
approach
,
when
Waterloo
could
be
dimly
*NL*
discerned
opening
before
Napoleon
,
the
mournful
acclamation
of
the
army
*NL*
and
the
people
to
the
condemned
of
destiny
had
nothing
laughable
in
it
,
*NL*
and
,
after
making
all
allowance
for
the
despot
,
a
heart
like
that
of
*NL*
the
Bishop
of
D
--
,
ought
not
perhaps
to
have
failed
to
recognize
the
*NL*
august
and
touching
features
presented
by
the
embrace
of
a
great
nation
*NL*
and
a
great
man
on
the
brink
of
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
exception
,
he
was
in
all
things
just
,
true
,
equitable
,
*NL*
intelligent
,
humble
and
dignified
,
beneficent
and
kindly
,
which
is
only
*NL*
another
sort
of
benevolence
.
He
was
a
priest
,
a
sage
,
and
a
man
.
It
must
*NL*
be
admitted
,
that
even
in
the
political
views
with
which
we
have
just
*NL*
reproached
him
,
and
which
we
are
disposed
to
judge
almost
with
severity
,
*NL*
he
was
tolerant
and
easy
,
more
so
,
perhaps
,
than
we
who
are
speaking
*NL*
here
.
The
porter
of
the
town-hall
had
been
placed
there
by
the
Emperor
.
*NL*
He
was
an
old
non-commissioned
officer
of
the
old
guard
,
a
member
of
the
*NL*
Legion
of
Honor
at
Austerlitz
,
as
much
of
a
Bonapartist
as
the
eagle
.
*NL*
This
poor
fellow
occasionally
let
slip
inconsiderate
remarks
,
which
the
*NL*
law
then
stigmatized
as
seditious
speeches
.
After
the
imperial
profile
*NL*
disappeared
from
the
Legion
of
Honor
,
he
never
dressed
himself
in
his
*NL*
regimentals
,
as
he
said
,
so
that
he
should
not
be
obliged
to
wear
his
*NL*
cross
.
He
had
himself
devoutly
removed
the
imperial
effigy
from
the
*NL*
cross
which
Napoleon
had
given
him
;
this
made
a
hole
,
and
he
would
not
*NL*
put
anything
in
its
place
.
``
I
will
die
,
''
he
said
,
``
rather
than
wear
the
*NL*
three
frogs
upon
my
heart
!
''
He
liked
to
scoff
aloud
at
Louis
XVIII
.
``
The
*NL*
gouty
old
creature
in
English
gaiters
!
''
he
said
;
``
let
him
take
himself
*NL*
off
to
Prussia
with
that
queue
of
his
.
''
He
was
happy
to
combine
in
the
*NL*
same
imprecation
the
two
things
which
he
most
detested
,
Prussia
and
*NL*
England
.
He
did
it
so
often
that
he
lost
his
place
.
There
he
was
,
turned
*NL*
out
of
the
house
,
with
his
wife
and
children
,
and
without
bread
.
The
*NL*
Bishop
sent
for
him
,
reproved
him
gently
,
and
appointed
him
beadle
in
*NL*
the
cathedral
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
nine
years
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
had
,
by
dint
of
holy
*NL*
deeds
and
gentle
manners
,
filled
the
town
of
D
--
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
tender
and
filial
reverence
.
Even
his
conduct
towards
Napoleon
had
been
*NL*
accepted
and
tacitly
pardoned
,
as
it
were
,
by
the
people
,
the
good
and
*NL*
weakly
flock
who
adored
their
emperor
,
but
loved
their
bishop
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
THE
SOLITUDE
OF
MONSEIGNEUR
WELCOME
*NL*
*NL*
A
bishop
is
almost
always
surrounded
by
a
full
squadron
of
little
abbes
,
*NL*
just
as
a
general
is
by
a
covey
of
young
officers
.
This
is
what
*NL*
that
charming
Saint
Francois
de
Sales
calls
somewhere
``
les
pretres
*NL*
blancs-becs
,
''
callow
priests
.
Every
career
has
its
aspirants
,
who
form
*NL*
a
train
for
those
who
have
attained
eminence
in
it
.
There
is
no
power
*NL*
which
has
not
its
dependents
.
There
is
no
fortune
which
has
not
its
*NL*
court
.
The
seekers
of
the
future
eddy
around
the
splendid
present
.
Every
*NL*
metropolis
has
its
staff
of
officials
.
Every
bishop
who
possesses
the
*NL*
least
influence
has
about
him
his
patrol
of
cherubim
from
the
seminary
,
*NL*
which
goes
the
round
,
and
maintains
good
order
in
the
episcopal
palace
,
*NL*
and
mounts
guard
over
monseigneur
's
smile
.
To
please
a
bishop
is
*NL*
equivalent
to
getting
one
's
foot
in
the
stirrup
for
a
sub-diaconate
.
*NL*
It
is
necessary
to
walk
one
's
path
discreetly
;
the
apostleship
does
not
*NL*
disdain
the
canonship
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
there
are
bigwigs
elsewhere
,
there
are
big
mitres
in
the
Church
.
*NL*
These
are
the
bishops
who
stand
well
at
Court
,
who
are
rich
,
well
*NL*
endowed
,
skilful
,
accepted
by
the
world
,
who
know
how
to
pray
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
but
who
know
also
how
to
beg
,
who
feel
little
scruple
at
making
a
whole
*NL*
diocese
dance
attendance
in
their
person
,
who
are
connecting
links
*NL*
between
the
sacristy
and
diplomacy
,
who
are
abbes
rather
than
priests
,
*NL*
prelates
rather
than
bishops
.
Happy
those
who
approach
them
!
Being
*NL*
persons
of
influence
,
they
create
a
shower
about
them
,
upon
the
*NL*
assiduous
and
the
favored
,
and
upon
all
the
young
men
who
understand
*NL*
the
art
of
pleasing
,
of
large
parishes
,
prebends
,
archidiaconates
,
*NL*
chaplaincies
,
and
cathedral
posts
,
while
awaiting
episcopal
honors
.
As
*NL*
they
advance
themselves
,
they
cause
their
satellites
to
progress
also
;
*NL*
it
is
a
whole
solar
system
on
the
march
.
Their
radiance
casts
a
gleam
*NL*
of
purple
over
their
suite
.
Their
prosperity
is
crumbled
up
behind
*NL*
the
scenes
,
into
nice
little
promotions
.
The
larger
the
diocese
of
the
*NL*
patron
,
the
fatter
the
curacy
for
the
favorite
.
And
then
,
there
is
Rome
.
*NL*
A
bishop
who
understands
how
to
become
an
archbishop
,
an
archbishop
who
*NL*
knows
how
to
become
a
cardinal
,
carries
you
with
him
as
conclavist
;
*NL*
you
enter
a
court
of
papal
jurisdiction
,
you
receive
the
pallium
,
and
*NL*
behold
!
you
are
an
auditor
,
then
a
papal
chamberlain
,
then
monsignor
,
*NL*
and
from
a
Grace
to
an
Eminence
is
only
a
step
,
and
between
the
Eminence
*NL*
and
the
Holiness
there
is
but
the
smoke
of
a
ballot
.
Every
skull-cap
may
*NL*
dream
of
the
tiara
.
The
priest
is
nowadays
the
only
man
who
can
become
a
*NL*
king
in
a
regular
manner
;
and
what
a
king
!
the
supreme
king
.
Then
what
a
*NL*
nursery
of
aspirations
is
a
seminary
!
How
many
blushing
choristers
,
*NL*
how
many
youthful
abbes
bear
on
their
heads
Perrette
's
pot
of
milk
!
*NL*
Who
knows
how
easy
it
is
for
ambition
to
call
itself
vocation
?
in
good
*NL*
faith
,
perchance
,
and
deceiving
itself
,
devotee
that
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
,
poor
,
humble
,
retiring
,
was
not
accounted
among
*NL*
the
big
mitres
.
This
was
plain
from
the
complete
absence
of
young
*NL*
priests
about
him
.
We
have
seen
that
he
``
did
not
take
''
in
Paris
.
Not
a
*NL*
single
future
dreamed
of
engrafting
itself
on
this
solitary
old
man
.
*NL*
Not
a
single
sprouting
ambition
committed
the
folly
of
putting
forth
its
*NL*
foliage
in
his
shadow
.
His
canons
and
grand-vicars
were
good
old
men
,
*NL*
rather
vulgar
like
himself
,
walled
up
like
him
in
this
diocese
,
without
*NL*
exit
to
a
cardinalship
,
and
who
resembled
their
bishop
,
with
this
*NL*
difference
,
that
they
were
finished
and
he
was
completed
.
The
*NL*
impossibility
of
growing
great
under
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
was
so
well
*NL*
understood
,
that
no
sooner
had
the
young
men
whom
he
ordained
left
the
*NL*
seminary
than
they
got
themselves
recommended
to
the
archbishops
of
Aix
*NL*
or
of
Auch
,
and
went
off
in
a
great
hurry
.
For
,
in
short
,
we
repeat
it
,
*NL*
men
wish
to
be
pushed
.
A
saint
who
dwells
in
a
paroxysm
of
abnegation
*NL*
is
a
dangerous
neighbor
;
he
might
communicate
to
you
,
by
contagion
,
*NL*
an
incurable
poverty
,
an
anchylosis
of
the
joints
,
which
are
useful
in
*NL*
advancement
,
and
in
short
,
more
renunciation
than
you
desire
;
and
*NL*
this
infectious
virtue
is
avoided
.
Hence
the
isolation
of
Monseigneur
*NL*
Bienvenu
.
We
live
in
the
midst
of
a
gloomy
society
.
Success
;
that
is
the
*NL*
lesson
which
falls
drop
by
drop
from
the
slope
of
corruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
it
said
in
passing
,
that
success
is
a
very
hideous
thing
.
Its
false
*NL*
resemblance
to
merit
deceives
men
.
For
the
masses
,
success
has
almost
*NL*
the
same
profile
as
supremacy
.
Success
,
that
Menaechmus
of
talent
,
has
*NL*
one
dupe
,
--
history
.
Juvenal
and
Tacitus
alone
grumble
at
it
.
In
our
*NL*
day
,
a
philosophy
which
is
almost
official
has
entered
into
its
*NL*
service
,
wears
the
livery
of
success
,
and
performs
the
service
of
its
*NL*
antechamber
.
Succeed
:
theory
.
Prosperity
argues
capacity
.
Win
in
the
*NL*
lottery
,
and
behold
!
you
are
a
clever
man
.
He
who
triumphs
is
venerated
.
*NL*
Be
born
with
a
silver
spoon
in
your
mouth
!
everything
lies
in
that
.
Be
*NL*
lucky
,
and
you
will
have
all
the
rest
;
be
happy
,
and
people
will
think
*NL*
you
great
.
Outside
of
five
or
six
immense
exceptions
,
which
compose
*NL*
the
splendor
of
a
century
,
contemporary
admiration
is
nothing
but
*NL*
short-sightedness
.
Gilding
is
gold
.
It
does
no
harm
to
be
the
first
*NL*
arrival
by
pure
chance
,
so
long
as
you
do
arrive
.
The
common
herd
is
an
*NL*
old
Narcissus
who
adores
himself
,
and
who
applauds
the
vulgar
herd
.
*NL*
That
enormous
ability
by
virtue
of
which
one
is
Moses
,
Aeschylus
,
Dante
,
*NL*
Michael
Angelo
,
or
Napoleon
,
the
multitude
awards
on
the
spot
,
and
by
*NL*
acclamation
,
to
whomsoever
attains
his
object
,
in
whatsoever
it
may
*NL*
consist
.
Let
a
notary
transfigure
himself
into
a
deputy
:
let
a
false
*NL*
Corneille
compose
Tiridate
;
let
a
eunuch
come
to
possess
a
harem
;
let
a
*NL*
military
Prudhomme
accidentally
win
the
decisive
battle
of
an
epoch
;
*NL*
let
an
apothecary
invent
cardboard
shoe-soles
for
the
army
of
the
*NL*
Sambre-and-Meuse
,
and
construct
for
himself
,
out
of
this
cardboard
,
sold
*NL*
as
leather
,
four
hundred
thousand
francs
of
income
;
let
a
pork-packer
*NL*
espouse
usury
,
and
cause
it
to
bring
forth
seven
or
eight
millions
,
of
*NL*
which
he
is
the
father
and
of
which
it
is
the
mother
;
let
a
preacher
*NL*
become
a
bishop
by
force
of
his
nasal
drawl
;
let
the
steward
of
a
fine
*NL*
family
be
so
rich
on
retiring
from
service
that
he
is
made
minister
*NL*
of
finances
,
--
and
men
call
that
Genius
,
just
as
they
call
the
face
*NL*
of
Mousqueton
Beauty
,
and
the
mien
of
Claude
Majesty
.
With
the
*NL*
constellations
of
space
they
confound
the
stars
of
the
abyss
which
are

made
in
the
soft
mire
of

by
the

of

CHAPTER
XIII
--
WHAT
HE
BELIEVED
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
not
obliged
to
sound
the
Bishop
of
D
--
on
the
score
of
*NL*
orthodoxy
.
In
the
presence
of
such
a
soul
we
feel
ourselves
in
no
mood
*NL*
but
respect
.
The
conscience
of
the
just
man
should
be
accepted
on
his
*NL*
word
.
Moreover
,
certain
natures
being
given
,
we
admit
the
possible
*NL*
development
of
all
beauties
of
human
virtue
in
a
belief
that
differs
*NL*
from
our
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
think
of
this
dogma
,
or
of
that
mystery
?
These
secrets
of
*NL*
the
inner
tribunal
of
the
conscience
are
known
only
to
the
tomb
,
where
*NL*
souls
enter
naked
.
The
point
on
which
we
are
certain
is
,
that
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
faith
never
resolved
themselves
into
hypocrisy
in
his
*NL*
case
.
No
decay
is
possible
to
the
diamond
.
He
believed
to
the
extent
*NL*
of
his
powers
.
``
Credo
in
Patrem
,
''
he
often
exclaimed
.
Moreover
,
he
*NL*
drew
from
good
works
that
amount
of
satisfaction
which
suffices
to
the
*NL*
conscience
,
and
which
whispers
to
a
man
,
``
Thou
art
with
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
which
we
consider
it
our
duty
to
note
is
,
that
outside
of
and
*NL*
beyond
his
faith
,
as
it
were
,
the
Bishop
possessed
an
excess
of
love
.
It
*NL*
was
in
that
quarter
,
quia
multum
amavit
,
--
because
he
loved
much
--
that
*NL*
he
was
regarded
as
vulnerable
by
``
serious
men
,
''
``
grave
persons
''
and
*NL*
``
reasonable
people
''
;
favorite
locutions
of
our
sad
world
where
egotism
*NL*
takes
its
word
of
command
from
pedantry
.
What
was
this
excess
of
love
?
*NL*
It
was
a
serene
benevolence
which
overflowed
men
,
as
we
have
already
*NL*
pointed
out
,
and
which
,
on
occasion
,
extended
even
to
things
.
He
lived
*NL*
without
disdain
.
He
was
indulgent
towards
God
's
creation
.
Every
man
,
*NL*
even
the
best
,
has
within
him
a
thoughtless
harshness
which
he
reserves
*NL*
for
animals
.
The
Bishop
of
D
--
had
none
of
that
harshness
,
which
is
*NL*
peculiar
to
many
priests
,
nevertheless
.
He
did
not
go
as
far
as
the
*NL*
Brahmin
,
but
he
seemed
to
have
weighed
this
saying
of
Ecclesiastes
:
``
Who
*NL*
knoweth
whither
the
soul
of
the
animal
goeth
?
''
Hideousness
of
aspect
,
*NL*
deformity
of
instinct
,
troubled
him
not
,
and
did
not
arouse
his
*NL*
indignation
.
He
was
touched
,
almost
softened
by
them
.
It
seemed
as
*NL*
though
he
went
thoughtfully
away
to
seek
beyond
the
bounds
of
life
which
*NL*
is
apparent
,
the
cause
,
the
explanation
,
or
the
excuse
for
them
.
He
*NL*
seemed
at
times
to
be
asking
God
to
commute
these
penalties
.
He
examined
*NL*
without
wrath
,
and
with
the
eye
of
a
linguist
who
is
deciphering
a
*NL*
palimpsest
,
that
portion
of
chaos
which
still
exists
in
nature
.
This
*NL*
revery
sometimes
caused
him
to
utter
odd
sayings
.
One
morning
he
was
in
*NL*
his
garden
,
and
thought
himself
alone
,
but
his
sister
was
walking
behind
*NL*
him
,
unseen
by
him
:
suddenly
he
paused
and
gazed
at
something
on
the
*NL*
ground
;
it
was
a
large
,
black
,
hairy
,
frightful
spider
.
His
sister
heard
*NL*
him
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
beast
!
It
is
not
its
fault
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Why
not
mention
these
almost
divinely
childish
sayings
of
kindness
?
*NL*
Puerile
they
may
be
;
but
these
sublime
puerilities
were
peculiar
to
*NL*
Saint
Francis
d'Assisi
and
of
Marcus
Aurelius
.
One
day
he
sprained
his
*NL*
ankle
in
his
effort
to
avoid
stepping
on
an
ant
.
Thus
lived
this
just
*NL*
man
.
Sometimes
he
fell
asleep
in
his
garden
,
and
then
there
was
nothing
*NL*
more
venerable
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
had
formerly
been
,
if
the
stories
anent
his
youth
,
*NL*
and
even
in
regard
to
his
manhood
,
were
to
be
believed
,
a
passionate
,
*NL*
and
,
possibly
,
a
violent
man
.
His
universal
suavity
was
less
an
instinct
*NL*
of
nature
than
the
result
of
a
grand
conviction
which
had
filtered
into
*NL*
his
heart
through
the
medium
of
life
,
and
had
trickled
there
slowly
,
*NL*
thought
by
thought
;
for
,
in
a
character
,
as
in
a
rock
,
there
may
exist
*NL*
apertures
made
by
drops
of
water
.
These
hollows
are
uneffaceable
;
these
*NL*
formations
are
indestructible
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1815
,
as
we
think
we
have
already
said
,
he
reached
his
seventy-fifth
*NL*
birthday
,
but
he
did
not
appear
to
be
more
than
sixty
.
He
was
not
tall
;
*NL*
he
was
rather
plump
;
and
,
in
order
to
combat
this
tendency
,
he
was
fond
*NL*
of
taking
long
strolls
on
foot
;
his
step
was
firm
,
and
his
form
was
*NL*
but
slightly
bent
,
a
detail
from
which
we
do
not
pretend
to
draw
any
*NL*
conclusion
.
Gregory
XVI.
,
at
the
age
of
eighty
,
held
himself
erect
and
*NL*
smiling
,
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
being
a
bad
bishop
.
Monseigneur
*NL*
Welcome
had
what
the
people
term
a
``
fine
head
,
''
but
so
amiable
was
he
*NL*
that
they
forgot
that
it
was
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
conversed
with
that
infantile
gayety
which
was
one
of
his
*NL*
charms
,
and
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
,
people
felt
at
their
ease
*NL*
with
him
,
and
joy
seemed
to
radiate
from
his
whole
person
.
His
fresh
and
*NL*
ruddy
complexion
,
his
very
white
teeth
,
all
of
which
he
had
preserved
,
*NL*
and
which
were
displayed
by
his
smile
,
gave
him
that
open
and
easy
air
*NL*
which
cause
the
remark
to
be
made
of
a
man
,
``
He
's
a
good
fellow
''
;
and
*NL*
of
an
old
man
,
``
He
is
a
fine
man
.
''
That
,
it
will
be
recalled
,
was
the
*NL*
effect
which
he
produced
upon
Napoleon
.
On
the
first
encounter
,
and
to
*NL*
one
who
saw
him
for
the
first
time
,
he
was
nothing
,
in
fact
,
but
a
fine
*NL*
man
.
But
if
one
remained
near
him
for
a
few
hours
,
and
beheld
him
in
the
*NL*
least
degree
pensive
,
the
fine
man
became
gradually
transfigured
,
and
*NL*
took
on
some
imposing
quality
,
I
know
not
what
;
his
broad
and
serious
*NL*
brow
,
rendered
august
by
his
white
locks
,
became
august
also
by
virtue
*NL*
of
meditation
;
majesty
radiated
from
his
goodness
,
though
his
goodness
*NL*
ceased
not
to
be
radiant
;
one
experienced
something
of
the
emotion
which
*NL*
one
would
feel
on
beholding
a
smiling
angel
slowly
unfold
his
wings
,
*NL*
without
ceasing
to
smile
.
Respect
,
an
unutterable
respect
,
penetrated
*NL*
you
by
degrees
and
mounted
to
your
heart
,
and
one
felt
that
one
had
*NL*
before
him
one
of
those
strong
,
thoroughly
tried
,
and
indulgent
souls
*NL*
where
thought
is
so
grand
that
it
can
no
longer
be
anything
but
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
seen
,
prayer
,
the
celebration
of
the
offices
of
religion
,
*NL*
alms-giving
,
the
consolation
of
the
afflicted
,
the
cultivation
of
a
bit
*NL*
of
land
,
fraternity
,
frugality
,
hospitality
,
renunciation
,
confidence
,
*NL*
study
,
work
,
filled
every
day
of
his
life
.
Filled
is
exactly
the
word
;
*NL*
certainly
the
Bishop
's
day
was
quite
full
to
the
brim
,
of
good
words
and
*NL*
good
deeds
.
Nevertheless
,
it
was
not
complete
if
cold
or
rainy
weather
*NL*
prevented
his
passing
an
hour
or
two
in
his
garden
before
going
to
bed
,
*NL*
and
after
the
two
women
had
retired
.
It
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
rite
with
*NL*
him
,
to
prepare
himself
for
slumber
by
meditation
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
grand
spectacles
of
the
nocturnal
heavens
.
Sometimes
,
if
the
two
old
*NL*
women
were
not
asleep
,
they
heard
him
pacing
slowly
along
the
walks
at
*NL*
a
very
advanced
hour
of
the
night
.
He
was
there
alone
,
communing
with
*NL*
himself
,
peaceful
,
adoring
,
comparing
the
serenity
of
his
heart
with
the
*NL*
serenity
of
the
ether
,
moved
amid
the
darkness
by
the
visible
splendor
*NL*
of
the
constellations
and
the
invisible
splendor
of
God
,
opening
his
*NL*
heart
to
the
thoughts
which
fall
from
the
Unknown
.
At
such
moments
,
*NL*
while
he
offered
his
heart
at
the
hour
when
nocturnal
flowers
offer
*NL*
their
perfume
,
illuminated
like
a
lamp
amid
the
starry
night
,
as
he
*NL*
poured
himself
out
in
ecstasy
in
the
midst
of
the
universal
radiance
of
*NL*
creation
,
he
could
not
have
told
himself
,
probably
,
what
was
passing
in
*NL*
his
spirit
;
he
felt
something
take
its
flight
from
him
,
and
something
*NL*
descend
into
him
.
Mysterious
exchange
of
the
abysses
of
the
soul
with
*NL*
the
abysses
of
the
universe
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
the
grandeur
and
presence
of
God
;
of
the
future
eternity
,
*NL*
that
strange
mystery
;
of
the
eternity
past
,
a
mystery
still
more
*NL*
strange
;
of
all
the
infinities
,
which
pierced
their
way
into
all
*NL*
his
senses
,
beneath
his
eyes
;
and
,
without
seeking
to
comprehend
the
*NL*
incomprehensible
,
he
gazed
upon
it
.
He
did
not
study
God
;
he
was
dazzled
*NL*
by
him
.
He
considered
those
magnificent
conjunctions
of
atoms
,
which
*NL*
communicate
aspects
to
matter
,
reveal
forces
by
verifying
them
,
create
*NL*
individualities
in
unity
,
proportions
in
extent
,
the
innumerable
in
the
*NL*
infinite
,
and
,
through
light
,
produce
beauty
.
These
conjunctions
are
*NL*
formed
and
dissolved
incessantly
;
hence
life
and
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seated
himself
on
a
wooden
bench
,
with
his
back
against
a
decrepit
*NL*
vine
;
he
gazed
at
the
stars
,
past
the
puny
and
stunted
silhouettes
*NL*
of
his
fruit-trees
.
This
quarter
of
an
acre
,
so
poorly
planted
,
so
*NL*
encumbered
with
mean
buildings
and
sheds
,
was
dear
to
him
,
and
satisfied
*NL*
his
wants
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
more
was
needed
by
this
old
man
,
who
divided
the
leisure
of
his
*NL*
life
,
where
there
was
so
little
leisure
,
between
gardening
in
the
*NL*
daytime
and
contemplation
at
night
?
Was
not
this
narrow
enclosure
,
with
*NL*
the
heavens
for
a
ceiling
,
sufficient
to
enable
him
to
adore
God
in
his
*NL*
most
divine
works
,
in
turn
?
Does
not
this
comprehend
all
,
in
fact
?
and
*NL*
what
is
there
left
to
desire
beyond
it
?
A
little
garden
in
which
to
*NL*
walk
,
and
immensity
in
which
to
dream
.
At
one
's
feet
that
which
can
be
*NL*
cultivated
and
plucked
;
over
head
that
which
one
can
study
and
meditate
*NL*
upon
:
some
flowers
on
earth
,
and
all
the
stars
in
the
sky
.

CHAPTER
XIV
--
WHAT
HE
THOUGHT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
last
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
this
sort
of
details
might
,
particularly
at
the
present
moment
,
*NL*
and
to
use
an
expression
now
in
fashion
,
give
to
the
Bishop
of
D
--
a
*NL*
certain
``
pantheistical
''
physiognomy
,
and
induce
the
belief
,
either
*NL*
to
his
credit
or
discredit
,
that
he
entertained
one
of
those
personal
*NL*
philosophies
which
are
peculiar
to
our
century
,
which
sometimes
spring
*NL*
up
in
solitary
spirits
,
and
there
take
on
a
form
and
grow
until
they
*NL*
usurp
the
place
of
religion
,
we
insist
upon
it
,
that
not
one
of
*NL*
those
persons
who
knew
Monseigneur
Welcome
would
have
thought
himself
*NL*
authorized
to
think
anything
of
the
sort
.
That
which
enlightened
this
*NL*
man
was
his
heart
.
His
wisdom
was
made
of
the
light
which
comes
from
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
systems
;
many
works
.
Abstruse
speculations
contain
vertigo
;
no
,
*NL*
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
risked
his
mind
in
apocalypses
.
The
*NL*
apostle
may
be
daring
,
but
the
bishop
must
be
timid
.
He
would
probably
*NL*
have
felt
a
scruple
at
sounding
too
far
in
advance
certain
problems
*NL*
which
are
,
in
a
manner
,
reserved
for
terrible
great
minds
.
There
is
a
*NL*
sacred
horror
beneath
the
porches
of
the
enigma
;
those
gloomy
openings
*NL*
stand
yawning
there
,
but
something
tells
you
,
you
,
a
passer-by
in
life
,
*NL*
that
you
must
not
enter
.
Woe
to
him
who
penetrates
thither
!
*NL*
*NL*
Geniuses
in
the
impenetrable
depths
of
abstraction
and
pure
speculation
,
*NL*
situated
,
so
to
speak
,
above
all
dogmas
,
propose
their
ideas
to
*NL*
God
.
Their
prayer
audaciously
offers
discussion
.
Their
adoration
*NL*
interrogates
.
This
is
direct
religion
,
which
is
full
of
anxiety
and
*NL*
responsibility
for
him
who
attempts
its
steep
cliffs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Human
meditation
has
no
limits
.
At
his
own
risk
and
peril
,
it
analyzes
*NL*
and
digs
deep
into
its
own
bedazzlement
.
One
might
almost
say
,
that
by
*NL*
a
sort
of
splendid
reaction
,
it
with
it
dazzles
nature
;
the
mysterious
*NL*
world
which
surrounds
us
renders
back
what
it
has
received
;
it
is
*NL*
probable
that
the
contemplators
are
contemplated
.
However
that
may
be
,
*NL*
there
are
on
earth
men
who
--
are
they
men
?
--
perceive
distinctly
at
the
*NL*
verge
of
the
horizons
of
revery
the
heights
of
the
absolute
,
and
who
*NL*
have
the
terrible
vision
of
the
infinite
mountain
.
Monseigneur
Welcome
*NL*
was
one
of
these
men
;
Monseigneur
Welcome
was
not
a
genius
.
He
would
*NL*
have
feared
those
sublimities
whence
some
very
great
men
even
,
like
*NL*
Swedenborg
and
Pascal
,
have
slipped
into
insanity
.
Certainly
,
these
*NL*
powerful
reveries
have
their
moral
utility
,
and
by
these
arduous
paths
*NL*
one
approaches
to
ideal
perfection
.
As
for
him
,
he
took
the
path
which
*NL*
shortens
,
--
the
Gospel
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
attempt
to
impart
to
his
chasuble
the
folds
of
Elijah
's
*NL*
mantle
;
he
projected
no
ray
of
future
upon
the
dark
groundswell
of
*NL*
events
;
he
did
not
seek
to
condense
in
flame
the
light
of
things
;
he
*NL*
had
nothing
of
the
prophet
and
nothing
of
the
magician
about
him
.
This
*NL*
humble
soul
loved
,
and
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
carried
prayer
to
the
pitch
of
a
superhuman
aspiration
is
*NL*
probable
:
but
one
can
no
more
pray
too
much
than
one
can
love
too
much
;
*NL*
and
if
it
is
a
heresy
to
pray
beyond
the
texts
,
Saint
Theresa
and
Saint
*NL*
Jerome
would
be
heretics
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inclined
towards
all
that
groans
and
all
that
expiates
.
The
universe
*NL*
appeared
to
him
like
an
immense
malady
;
everywhere
he
felt
fever
,
*NL*
everywhere
he
heard
the
sound
of
suffering
,
and
,
without
seeking
to
*NL*
solve
the
enigma
,
he
strove
to
dress
the
wound
.
The
terrible
spectacle
*NL*
of
created
things
developed
tenderness
in
him
;
he
was
occupied
only
*NL*
in
finding
for
himself
,
and
in
inspiring
others
with
the
best
way
to
*NL*
compassionate
and
relieve
.
That
which
exists
was
for
this
good
and
rare
*NL*
priest
a
permanent
subject
of
sadness
which
sought
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
men
who
toil
at
extracting
gold
;
he
toiled
at
the
extraction
*NL*
of
pity
.
Universal
misery
was
his
mine
.
The
sadness
which
reigned
*NL*
everywhere
was
but
an
excuse
for
unfailing
kindness
.
Love
each
other
;
he
*NL*
declared
this
to
be
complete
,
desired
nothing
further
,
and
that
was
the
*NL*
whole
of
his
doctrine
.
One
day
,
that
man
who
believed
himself
to
be
a
*NL*
``
philosopher
,
''
the
senator
who
has
already
been
alluded
to
,
said
to
the
*NL*
Bishop
:
``
Just
survey
the
spectacle
of
the
world
:
all
war
against
*NL*
all
;
the
strongest
has
the
most
wit
.
Your
love
each
other
is
*NL*
nonsense
.
''
--
``
Well
,
''
replied
Monseigneur
Welcome
,
without
contesting
the
*NL*
point
,
``
if
it
is
nonsense
,
the
soul
should
shut
itself
up
in
it
,
as
the
*NL*
pearl
in
the
oyster
.
''
Thus
he
shut
himself
up
,
he
lived
there
,
he
*NL*
was
absolutely
satisfied
with
it
,
leaving
on
one
side
the
prodigious
*NL*
questions
which
attract
and
terrify
,
the
fathomless
perspectives
of
*NL*
abstraction
,
the
precipices
of
metaphysics
--
all
those
profundities
*NL*
which
converge
,
for
the
apostle
in
God
,
for
the
atheist
in
nothingness
;
*NL*
destiny
,
good
and
evil
,
the
way
of
being
against
being
,
the
conscience
*NL*
of
man
,
the
thoughtful
somnambulism
of
the
animal
,
the
transformation
*NL*
in
death
,
the
recapitulation
of
existences
which
the
tomb
contains
,
the
*NL*
incomprehensible
grafting
of
successive
loves
on
the
persistent
_
I
_
,
*NL*
the
essence
,
the
substance
,
the
Nile
,
and
the
Ens
,
the
soul
,
nature
,
*NL*
liberty
,
necessity
;
perpendicular
problems
,
sinister
obscurities
,
where
*NL*
lean
the
gigantic
archangels
of
the
human
mind
;
formidable
abysses
,
*NL*
which
Lucretius
,
Manou
,
Saint
Paul
,
Dante
,
contemplate
with
eyes
*NL*
flashing
lightning
,
which
seems
by
its
steady
gaze
on
the
infinite
to
*NL*
cause
stars
to
blaze
forth
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
was
simply
a
man
who
took
note
of
the
exterior
of
*NL*
mysterious
questions
without
scrutinizing
them
,
and
without
troubling
*NL*
his
own
mind
with
them
,
and
who
cherished
in
his
own
soul
a
grave
*NL*
respect
for
darkness
.

THE
FALL

*NL*
CHAPTER
I
--
THE
EVENING
OF
A
DAY
OF
WALKING
*NL*
*NL*
Early
in
the
month
of
October
,
1815
,
about
an
hour
before
sunset
,
a
*NL*
man
who
was
travelling
on
foot
entered
the
little
town
of
D
--
The
few
*NL*
inhabitants
who
were
at
their
windows
or
on
their
thresholds
at
the
*NL*
moment
stared
at
this
traveller
with
a
sort
of
uneasiness
.
It
was
*NL*
difficult
to
encounter
a
wayfarer
of
more
wretched
appearance
.
He
was
*NL*
a
man
of
medium
stature
,
thickset
and
robust
,
in
the
prime
of
life
.
*NL*
He
might
have
been
forty-six
or
forty-eight
years
old
.
A
cap
with
a
*NL*
drooping
leather
visor
partly
concealed
his
face
,
burned
and
tanned
by
*NL*
sun
and
wind
,
and
dripping
with
perspiration
.
His
shirt
of
coarse
yellow
*NL*
linen
,
fastened
at
the
neck
by
a
small
silver
anchor
,
permitted
a
view
*NL*
of
his
hairy
breast
:
he
had
a
cravat
twisted
into
a
string
;
trousers
of
*NL*
blue
drilling
,
worn
and
threadbare
,
white
on
one
knee
and
torn
on
the
*NL*
other
;
an
old
gray
,
tattered
blouse
,
patched
on
one
of
the
elbows
with
*NL*
a
bit
of
green
cloth
sewed
on
with
twine
;
a
tightly
packed
soldier
*NL*
knapsack
,
well
buckled
and
perfectly
new
,
on
his
back
;
an
enormous
,
*NL*
knotty
stick
in
his
hand
;
iron-shod
shoes
on
his
stockingless
feet
;
a
*NL*
shaved
head
and
a
long
beard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sweat
,
the
heat
,
the
journey
on
foot
,
the
dust
,
added
I
know
not
*NL*
what
sordid
quality
to
this
dilapidated
whole
.
His
hair
was
closely
cut
,
*NL*
yet
bristling
,
for
it
had
begun
to
grow
a
little
,
and
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
have
been
cut
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
knew
him
.
He
was
evidently
only
a
chance
passer-by
.
Whence
came
*NL*
he
?
From
the
south
;
from
the
seashore
,
perhaps
,
for
he
made
his
entrance
*NL*
into
D
--
by
the
same
street
which
,
seven
months
previously
,
had
*NL*
witnessed
the
passage
of
the
Emperor
Napoleon
on
his
way
from
Cannes
*NL*
to
Paris
.
This
man
must
have
been
walking
all
day
.
He
seemed
very
much
*NL*
fatigued
.
Some
women
of
the
ancient
market
town
which
is
situated
below
*NL*
the
city
had
seen
him
pause
beneath
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
Gassendi
,
*NL*
and
drink
at
the
fountain
which
stands
at
the
end
of
the
promenade
.
He
*NL*
must
have
been
very
thirsty
:
for
the
children
who
followed
him
saw
him
*NL*
stop
again
for
a
drink
,
two
hundred
paces
further
on
,
at
the
fountain
in
*NL*
the
market-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Poichevert
,
he
turned
to
the
left
,
*NL*
and
directed
his
steps
toward
the
town-hall
.
He
entered
,
then
came
out
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
.
A
gendarme
was
seated
near
the
door
,
on
the
*NL*
stone
bench
which
General
Drouot
had
mounted
on
the
4th
of
March
to
read
*NL*
to
the
frightened
throng
of
the
inhabitants
of
D
--
the
proclamation
*NL*
of
the
Gulf
Juan
.
The
man
pulled
off
his
cap
and
humbly
saluted
the
*NL*
gendarme
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gendarme
,
without
replying
to
his
salute
,
stared
attentively
at
him
,
*NL*
followed
him
for
a
while
with
his
eyes
,
and
then
entered
the
town-hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
then
existed
at
D
--
a
fine
inn
at
the
sign
of
the
Cross
of
*NL*
Colbas
.
This
inn
had
for
a
landlord
a
certain
Jacquin
Labarre
,
a
man
*NL*
of
consideration
in
the
town
on
account
of
his
relationship
to
another
*NL*
Labarre
,
who
kept
the
inn
of
the
Three
Dauphins
in
Grenoble
,
and
had
*NL*
served
in
the
Guides
.
At
the
time
of
the
Emperor
's
landing
,
many
rumors
*NL*
had
circulated
throughout
the
country
with
regard
to
this
inn
of
the
*NL*
Three
Dauphins
.
It
was
said
that
General
Bertrand
,
disguised
as
a
*NL*
carter
,
had
made
frequent
trips
thither
in
the
month
of
January
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
distributed
crosses
of
honor
to
the
soldiers
and
handfuls
*NL*
of
gold
to
the
citizens
.
The
truth
is
,
that
when
the
Emperor
entered
*NL*
Grenoble
he
had
refused
to
install
himself
at
the
hotel
of
the
*NL*
prefecture
;
he
had
thanked
the
mayor
,
saying
,
``
I
am
going
to
the
house
*NL*
of
a
brave
man
of
my
acquaintance
''
;
and
he
had
betaken
himself
to
the
*NL*
Three
Dauphins
.
This
glory
of
the
Labarre
of
the
Three
Dauphins
was
*NL*
reflected
upon
the
Labarre
of
the
Cross
of
Colbas
,
at
a
distance
of
five
*NL*
and
twenty
leagues
.
It
was
said
of
him
in
the
town
,
``
That
is
the
cousin
*NL*
of
the
man
of
Grenoble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
bent
his
steps
towards
this
inn
,
which
was
the
best
in
the
*NL*
country-side
.
He
entered
the
kitchen
,
which
opened
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
street
.
All
the
stoves
were
lighted
;
a
huge
fire
blazed
gayly
in
the
*NL*
fireplace
.
The
host
,
who
was
also
the
chief
cook
,
was
going
from
one
*NL*
stew-pan
to
another
,
very
busily
superintending
an
excellent
dinner
*NL*
designed
for
the
wagoners
,
whose
loud
talking
,
conversation
,
and
*NL*
laughter
were
audible
from
an
adjoining
apartment
.
Any
one
who
has
*NL*
travelled
knows
that
there
is
no
one
who
indulges
in
better
cheer
than
*NL*
wagoners
.
A
fat
marmot
,
flanked
by
white
partridges
and
heather-cocks
,
*NL*
was
turning
on
a
long
spit
before
the
fire
;
on
the
stove
,
two
huge
carps
*NL*
from
Lake
Lauzet
and
a
trout
from
Lake
Alloz
were
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
,
hearing
the
door
open
and
seeing
a
newcomer
enter
,
said
,
*NL*
without
raising
his
eyes
from
his
stoves
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Food
and
lodging
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
easier
,
''
replied
the
host
.
At
that
moment
he
turned
his
head
,
*NL*
took
in
the
traveller
's
appearance
with
a
single
glance
,
and
added
,
``
By
*NL*
paying
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
drew
a
large
leather
purse
from
the
pocket
of
his
blouse
,
and
*NL*
answered
,
``
I
have
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
we
are
at
your
service
,
''
said
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
put
his
purse
back
in
his
pocket
,
removed
his
knapsack
from
*NL*
his
back
,
put
it
on
the
ground
near
the
door
,
retained
his
stick
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
seated
himself
on
a
low
stool
close
to
the
fire
.
D
--
is
in
*NL*
the
mountains
.
The
evenings
are
cold
there
in
October
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
host
went
back
and
forth
,
he
scrutinized
the
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
dinner
be
ready
soon
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
''
replied
the
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
newcomer
was
warming
himself
before
the
fire
,
with
his
back
*NL*
turned
,
the
worthy
host
,
Jacquin
Labarre
,
drew
a
pencil
from
his
pocket
,
*NL*
then
tore
off
the
corner
of
an
old
newspaper
which
was
lying
on
a
small
*NL*
table
near
the
window
.
On
the
white
margin
he
wrote
a
line
or
two
,
*NL*
folded
it
without
sealing
,
and
then
intrusted
this
scrap
of
paper
to
*NL*
a
child
who
seemed
to
serve
him
in
the
capacity
both
of
scullion
and
*NL*
lackey
.
The
landlord
whispered
a
word
in
the
scullion
's
ear
,
and
the
*NL*
child
set
off
on
a
run
in
the
direction
of
the
town-hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
saw
nothing
of
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
he
inquired
,
``
Will
dinner
be
ready
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
,
''
responded
the
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
returned
.
He
brought
back
the
paper
.
The
host
unfolded
it
*NL*
eagerly
,
like
a
person
who
is
expecting
a
reply
.
He
seemed
to
read
it
*NL*
attentively
,
then
tossed
his
head
,
and
remained
thoughtful
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
Then
he
took
a
step
in
the
direction
of
the
traveller
,
who
appeared
to
*NL*
be
immersed
in
reflections
which
were
not
very
serene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
receive
you
,
sir
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
half
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Are
you
afraid
that
I
will
not
pay
you
?
Do
you
want
me
to
pay
you
*NL*
in
advance
?
I
have
money
,
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
money
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
''
said
the
host
,
``
have
no
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
resumed
tranquilly
,
``
Put
me
in
the
stable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
horses
take
up
all
the
space
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
!
''
retorted
the
man
;
``
a
corner
of
the
loft
then
,
a
truss
of
*NL*
straw
.
We
will
see
about
that
after
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
give
you
any
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
declaration
,
made
in
a
measured
but
firm
tone
,
struck
the
stranger
*NL*
as
grave
.
He
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
bah
!
But
I
am
dying
of
hunger
.
I
have
been
walking
since
sunrise
.
I
*NL*
have
travelled
twelve
leagues
.
I
pay
.
I
wish
to
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
nothing
,
''
said
the
landlord
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
burst
out
laughing
,
and
turned
towards
the
fireplace
and
the
*NL*
stoves
:
``
Nothing
!
and
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
whom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
messieurs
the
wagoners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
are
there
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twelve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
enough
food
there
for
twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
engaged
the
whole
of
it
and
paid
for
it
in
advance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
seated
himself
again
,
and
said
,
without
raising
his
voice
,
``
I
am
*NL*
at
an
inn
;
I
am
hungry
,
and
I
shall
remain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
host
bent
down
to
his
ear
,
and
said
in
a
tone
which
made
him
*NL*
start
,
``
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
traveller
was
bending
forward
and
thrusting
some
*NL*
brands
into
the
fire
with
the
iron-shod
tip
of
his
staff
;
he
turned
*NL*
quickly
round
,
and
as
he
opened
his
mouth
to
reply
,
the
host
gazed
*NL*
steadily
at
him
and
added
,
still
in
a
low
voice
:
``
Stop
!
there
's
enough
*NL*
of
that
sort
of
talk
.
Do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
your
name
?
Your
name
is
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
Now
do
you
want
me
to
tell
you
who
you
are
?
When
I
saw
you
*NL*
come
in
I
suspected
something
;
I
sent
to
the
town-hall
,
and
this
was
the
*NL*
reply
that
was
sent
to
me
.
Can
you
read
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
held
out
to
the
stranger
,
fully
unfolded
,
the
paper
which
*NL*
had
just
travelled
from
the
inn
to
the
town-hall
,
and
from
the
town-hall
*NL*
to
the
inn
.
The
man
cast
a
glance
upon
it
.
The
landlord
resumed
after
a
*NL*
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
the
habit
of
being
polite
to
every
one
.
Go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
dropped
his
head
,
picked
up
the
knapsack
which
he
had
deposited
*NL*
on
the
ground
,
and
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
chose
the
principal
street
.
He
walked
straight
on
at
a
venture
,
*NL*
keeping
close
to
the
houses
like
a
sad
and
humiliated
man
.
He
did
not
*NL*
turn
round
a
single
time
.
Had
he
done
so
,
he
would
have
seen
the
host
*NL*
of
the
Cross
of
Colbas
standing
on
his
threshold
,
surrounded
by
all
*NL*
the
guests
of
his
inn
,
and
all
the
passers-by
in
the
street
,
talking
*NL*
vivaciously
,
and
pointing
him
out
with
his
finger
;
and
,
from
the
glances
*NL*
of
terror
and
distrust
cast
by
the
group
,
he
might
have
divined
that
his
*NL*
arrival
would
speedily
become
an
event
for
the
whole
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
nothing
of
all
this
.
People
who
are
crushed
do
not
look
behind
*NL*
them
.
They
know
but
too
well
the
evil
fate
which
follows
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
proceeded
for
some
time
,
walking
on
without
ceasing
,
traversing
*NL*
at
random
streets
of
which
he
knew
nothing
,
forgetful
of
his
fatigue
,
*NL*
as
is
often
the
case
when
a
man
is
sad
.
All
at
once
he
felt
the
pangs
*NL*
of
hunger
sharply
.
Night
was
drawing
near
.
He
glanced
about
him
,
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
could
not
discover
some
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fine
hostelry
was
closed
to
him
;
he
was
seeking
some
very
humble
*NL*
public
house
,
some
hovel
,
however
lowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
then
a
light
flashed
up
at
the
end
of
the
streets
;
a
pine
branch
*NL*
suspended
from
a
cross-beam
of
iron
was
outlined
against
the
white
sky
*NL*
of
the
twilight
.
He
proceeded
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
proved
to
be
,
in
fact
,
a
public
house
.
The
public
house
which
is
in
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Chaffaut
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wayfarer
halted
for
a
moment
,
and
peeped
through
the
window
into
the
*NL*
interior
of
the
low-studded
room
of
the
public
house
,
illuminated
by
a
*NL*
small
lamp
on
a
table
and
by
a
large
fire
on
the
hearth
.
Some
men
were
*NL*
engaged
in
drinking
there
.
The
landlord
was
warming
himself
.
An
iron
*NL*
pot
,
suspended
from
a
crane
,
bubbled
over
the
flame
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
to
this
public
house
,
which
is
also
a
sort
of
an
inn
,
is
by
*NL*
two
doors
.
One
opens
on
the
street
,
the
other
upon
a
small
yard
filled
*NL*
with
manure
.
The
traveller
dare
not
enter
by
the
street
door
.
He
slipped
*NL*
into
the
yard
,
halted
again
,
then
raised
the
latch
timidly
and
opened
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
said
the
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
who

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
.
We
furnish
supper
and
bed
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
.
All
the
men
who
were
drinking
turned
round
.
The
lamp
*NL*
illuminated
him
on
one
side
,
the
firelight
on
the
other
.
They
examined
*NL*
him
for
some
time
while
he
was
taking
off
his
knapsack
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
host
said
to
him
,
``
There
is
the
fire
.
The
supper
is
cooking
in
the
*NL*
pot
.
Come
and
warm
yourself
,
comrade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
and
seated
himself
near
the
hearth
.
He
stretched
out
his
*NL*
feet
,
which
were
exhausted
with
fatigue
,
to
the
fire
;
a
fine
odor
was
*NL*
emitted
by
the
pot
.
All
that
could
be
distinguished
of
his
face
,
beneath
*NL*
his
cap
,
which
was
well
pulled
down
,
assumed
a
vague
appearance
*NL*
of
comfort
,
mingled
with
that
other
poignant
aspect
which
habitual
*NL*
suffering
bestows
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
moreover
,
a
firm
,
energetic
,
and
melancholy
profile
.
This
*NL*
physiognomy
was
strangely
composed
;
it
began
by
seeming
humble
,
and
*NL*
ended
by
seeming
severe
.
The
eye
shone
beneath
its
lashes
like
a
fire
*NL*
beneath
brushwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
men
seated
at
the
table
,
however
,
was
a
fishmonger
who
,
*NL*
before
entering
the
public
house
of
the
Rue
de
Chaffaut
,
had
been
to
*NL*
stable
his
horse
at
Labarre
's
.
It
chanced
that
he
had
that
very
morning
*NL*
encountered
this
unprepossessing
stranger
on
the
road
between
Bras
*NL*
d'Asse
and
--
I
have
forgotten
the
name
.
I
think
it
was
Escoublon
.
Now
,
*NL*
when
he
met
him
,
the
man
,
who
then
seemed
already
extremely
weary
,
had
*NL*
requested
him
to
take
him
on
his
crupper
;
to
which
the
fishmonger
had
*NL*
made
no
reply
except
by
redoubling
his
gait
.
This
fishmonger
had
been
*NL*
a
member
half
an
hour
previously
of
the
group
which
surrounded
Jacquin
*NL*
Labarre
,
and
had
himself
related
his
disagreeable
encounter
of
the
*NL*
morning
to
the
people
at
the
Cross
of
Colbas
.
From
where
he
sat
he
made
*NL*
an
imperceptible
sign
to
the
tavern-keeper
.
The
tavern-keeper
went
to
*NL*
him
.
They
exchanged
a
few
words
in
a
low
tone
.
The
man
had
again
become
*NL*
absorbed
in
his
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tavern-keeper
returned
to
the
fireplace
,
laid
his
hand
abruptly
on
*NL*
the
shoulder
of
the
man
,
and
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
going
to
get
out
of
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
turned
round
and
replied
gently
,
``
Ah
!
You
know
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sent
away
from
the
other
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
are
to
be
turned
out
of
this
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
would
you
have
me
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
took
his
stick
and
his
knapsack
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
went
out
,
some
children
who
had
followed
him
from
the
Cross
of
*NL*
Colbas
,
and
who
seemed
to
be
lying
in
wait
for
him
,
threw
stones
at
him
.
*NL*
He
retraced
his
steps
in
anger
,
and
threatened
them
with
his
stick
:
the
*NL*
children
dispersed
like
a
flock
of
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
before
the
prison
.
At
the
door
hung
an
iron
chain
attached
to
*NL*
a
bell
.
He
rang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wicket
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turnkey
,
''
said
he
,
removing
his
cap
politely
,
``
will
you
have
the
*NL*
kindness
to
admit
me
,
and
give
me
a
lodging
for
the
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
prison
is
not
an
inn
.
Get
yourself
arrested
,
and
you
will
be
*NL*
admitted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wicket
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
a
little
street
in
which
there
were
many
gardens
.
Some
of
*NL*
them
are
enclosed
only
by
hedges
,
which
lends
a
cheerful
aspect
to
the
*NL*
street
.
In
the
midst
of
these
gardens
and
hedges
he
caught
sight
of
a
*NL*
small
house
of
a
single
story
,
the
window
of
which
was
lighted
up
.
He
*NL*
peered
through
the
pane
as
he
had
done
at
the
public
house
.
Within
was
a
*NL*
large
whitewashed
room
,
with
a
bed
draped
in
printed
cotton
stuff
,
and
*NL*
a
cradle
in
one
corner
,
a
few
wooden
chairs
,
and
a
double-barrelled
gun
*NL*
hanging
on
the
wall
.
A
table
was
spread
in
the
centre
of
the
room
.
A
*NL*
copper
lamp
illuminated
the
tablecloth
of
coarse
white
linen
,
the
pewter
*NL*
jug
shining
like
silver
,
and
filled
with
wine
,
and
the
brown
,
smoking
*NL*
soup-tureen
.
At
this
table
sat
a
man
of
about
forty
,
with
a
merry
and
*NL*
open
countenance
,
who
was
dandling
a
little
child
on
his
knees
.
Close
by
*NL*
a
very
young
woman
was
nursing
another
child
.
The
father
was
laughing
,
*NL*
the
child
was
laughing
,
the
mother
was
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
paused
a
moment
in
revery
before
this
tender
and
calming
*NL*
spectacle
.
What
was
taking
place
within
him
?
He
alone
could
have
*NL*
told
.
It
is
probable
that
he
thought
that
this
joyous
house
would
be
*NL*
hospitable
,
and
that
,
in
a
place
where
he
beheld
so
much
happiness
,
he
*NL*
would
find
perhaps
a
little
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tapped
on
the
pane
with
a
very
small
and
feeble
knock
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tapped
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
woman
say
,
``
It
seems
to
me
,
husband
,
that
some
one
is
*NL*
knocking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tapped
a
third
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
rose
,
took
the
lamp
,
and
went
to
the
door
,
which
he
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
man
of
lofty
stature
,
half
peasant
,
half
artisan
.
He
wore
a
*NL*
huge
leather
apron
,
which
reached
to
his
left
shoulder
,
and
which
a
*NL*
hammer
,
a
red
handkerchief
,
a
powder-horn
,
and
all
sorts
of
objects
*NL*
which
were
upheld
by
the
girdle
,
as
in
a
pocket
,
caused
to
bulge
out
.
He
*NL*
carried
his
head
thrown
backwards
;
his
shirt
,
widely
opened
and
turned
*NL*
back
,
displayed
his
bull
neck
,
white
and
bare
.
He
had
thick
eyelashes
,
*NL*
enormous
black
whiskers
,
prominent
eyes
,
the
lower
part
of
his
face
*NL*
like
a
snout
;
and
besides
all
this
,
that
air
of
being
on
his
own
ground
,
*NL*
which
is
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
sir
,
''
said
the
wayfarer
,
``
Could
you
,
in
consideration
of
*NL*
payment
,
give
me
a
plate
of
soup
and
a
corner
of
that
shed
yonder
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
in
which
to
sleep
?
Tell
me
;
can
you
?
For
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
demanded
the
master
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
replied
:
``
I
have
just
come
from
Puy-Moisson
.
I
have
walked
all
*NL*
day
long
.
I
have
travelled
twelve
leagues
.
Can
you
?
--
if
I
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
refuse
,
''
said
the
peasant
,
``
to
lodge
any
respectable
man
*NL*
who
would
pay
me
.
But
why
do
you
not
go
to
the
inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
Impossible
.
This
is
neither
a
fair
nor
a
market
day
.
Have
you
been
*NL*
to
Labarre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
replied
with
embarrassment
:
``
I
do
not
know
.
He
did
not
*NL*
receive
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
What
's
-
his-name
's
,
in
the
Rue
Chaffaut
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
's
embarrassment
increased
;
he
stammered
,
``
He
did
not
*NL*
receive
me
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasant
's
countenance
assumed
an
expression
of
distrust
;
he
surveyed
*NL*
the
newcomer
from
head
to
feet
,
and
suddenly
exclaimed
,
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
shudder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
man
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
a
fresh
glance
upon
the
stranger
,
took
three
steps
backwards
,
*NL*
placed
the
lamp
on
the
table
,
and
took
his
gun
down
from
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
at
the
words
,
Are
you
the
man
?
the
woman
had
risen
,
had
*NL*
clasped
her
two
children
in
her
arms
,
and
had
taken
refuge
precipitately
*NL*
behind
her
husband
,
staring
in
terror
at
the
stranger
,
with
her
bosom
*NL*
uncovered
,
and
with
frightened
eyes
,
as
she
murmured
in
a
low
tone
,
*NL*
``
Tso-maraude
.

*NL*
All
this
took
place
in
less
time
than
it
requires
to
picture
it
to
*NL*
one
's
self
.
After
having
scrutinized
the
man
for
several
moments
,
as
one
*NL*
scrutinizes
a
viper
,
the
master
of
the
house
returned
to
the
door
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Clear
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
pity
's
sake
,
a
glass
of
water
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
shot
from
my
gun
!
''
said
the
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
closed
the
door
violently
,
and
the
man
heard
him
shoot
two
large
*NL*
bolts
.
A
moment
later
,
the
window-shutter
was
closed
,
and
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
bar
of
iron
which
was
placed
against
it
was
audible
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
continued
to
fall
.
A
cold
wind
from
the
Alps
was
blowing
.
By
the
*NL*
light
of
the
expiring
day
the
stranger
perceived
,
in
one
of
the
gardens
*NL*
which
bordered
the
street
,
a
sort
of
hut
,
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
*NL*
built
of
sods
.
He
climbed
over
the
wooden
fence
resolutely
,
and
found
*NL*
himself
in
the
garden
.
He
approached
the
hut
;
its
door
consisted
of
a
*NL*
very
low
and
narrow
aperture
,
and
it
resembled
those
buildings
which
*NL*
road-laborers
construct
for
themselves
along
the
roads
.
He
thought
*NL*
without
doubt
,
that
it
was
,
in
fact
,
the
dwelling
of
a
road-laborer
;
he
*NL*
was
suffering
from
cold
and
hunger
,
but
this
was
,
at
least
,
a
shelter
*NL*
from
the
cold
.
This
sort
of
dwelling
is
not
usually
occupied
at
night
.
*NL*
He
threw
himself
flat
on
his
face
,
and
crawled
into
the
hut
.
It
was
warm
*NL*
there
,
and
he
found
a
tolerably
good
bed
of
straw
.
He
lay
,
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
stretched
out
on
this
bed
,
without
the
power
to
make
a
movement
,
so
*NL*
fatigued
was
he
.
Then
,
as
the
knapsack
on
his
back
was
in
his
way
,
and
*NL*
as
it
furnished
,
moreover
,
a
pillow
ready
to
his
hand
,
he
set
about
*NL*
unbuckling
one
of
the
straps
.
At
that
moment
,
a
ferocious
growl
became
*NL*
audible
.
He
raised
his
eyes
.
The
head
of
an
enormous
dog
was
outlined
in
*NL*
the
darkness
at
the
entrance
of
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dog
's
kennel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
himself
vigorous
and
formidable
;
he
armed
himself
with
his
staff
,
*NL*
made
a
shield
of
his
knapsack
,
and
made
his
way
out
of
the
kennel
in
the
*NL*
best
way
he
could
,
not
without
enlarging
the
rents
in
his
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
garden
in
the
same
manner
,
but
backwards
,
being
obliged
,
*NL*
in
order
to
keep
the
dog
respectful
,
to
have
recourse
to
that
manoeuvre
*NL*
with
his
stick
which
masters
in
that
sort
of
fencing
designate
as
la
*NL*
rose
couverte
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
,
not
without
difficulty
,
repassed
the
fence
,
and
found
*NL*
himself
once
more
in
the
street
,
alone
,
without
refuge
,
without
shelter
,
*NL*
without
a
roof
over
his
head
,
chased
even
from
that
bed
of
straw
and
*NL*
from
that
miserable
kennel
,
he
dropped
rather
than
seated
himself
on
a
*NL*
stone
,
and
it
appears
that
a
passer-by
heard
him
exclaim
,
``
I
am
not
even
*NL*
a
dog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
rose
again
and
resumed
his
march
.
He
went
out
of
the
town
,
*NL*
hoping
to
find
some
tree
or
haystack
in
the
fields
which
would
afford
*NL*
him
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
thus
for
some
time
,
with
his
head
still
drooping
.
When
he
felt
*NL*
himself
far
from
every
human
habitation
,
he
raised
his
eyes
and
gazed
*NL*
searchingly
about
him
.
He
was
in
a
field
.
Before
him
was
one
of
those
*NL*
low
hills
covered
with
close-cut
stubble
,
which
,
after
the
harvest
,
*NL*
resemble
shaved
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horizon
was
perfectly
black
.
This
was
not
alone
the
obscurity
of
*NL*
night
;
it
was
caused
by
very
low-hanging
clouds
which
seemed
to
rest
*NL*
upon
the
hill
itself
,
and
which
were
mounting
and
filling
the
whole
*NL*
sky
.
Meanwhile
,
as
the
moon
was
about
to
rise
,
and
as
there
was
still
*NL*
floating
in
the
zenith
a
remnant
of
the
brightness
of
twilight
,
these
*NL*
clouds
formed
at
the
summit
of
the
sky
a
sort
of
whitish
arch
,
whence
a
*NL*
gleam
of
light
fell
upon
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
earth
was
thus
better
lighted
than
the
sky
,
which
produces
a
*NL*
particularly
sinister
effect
,
and
the
hill
,
whose
contour
was
poor
and
*NL*
mean
,
was
outlined
vague
and
wan
against
the
gloomy
horizon
.
The
whole
*NL*
effect
was
hideous
,
petty
,
lugubrious
,
and
narrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
in
the
field
or
on
the
hill
except
a
deformed
tree
,
*NL*
which
writhed
and
shivered
a
few
paces
distant
from
the
wayfarer
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
evidently
very
far
from
having
those
delicate
habits
of
*NL*
intelligence
and
spirit
which
render
one
sensible
to
the
mysterious
*NL*
aspects
of
things
;
nevertheless
,
there
was
something
in
that
sky
,
*NL*
in
that
hill
,
in
that
plain
,
in
that
tree
,
which
was
so
profoundly
*NL*
desolate
,
that
after
a
moment
of
immobility
and
revery
he
turned
back
*NL*
abruptly
.
There
are
instants
when
nature
seems
hostile
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
retraced
his
steps
;
the
gates
of
D
--
were
closed
.
D
--
,
which
had
*NL*
sustained
sieges
during
the
wars
of
religion
,
was
still
surrounded
*NL*
in
1815
by
ancient
walls
flanked
by
square
towers
which
have
been
*NL*
demolished
since
.
He
passed
through
a
breach
and
entered
the
town
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
As
he
was
not
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
streets
,
he
recommenced
his
walk
at
random
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
he
came
to
the
prefecture
,
then
to
the
seminary
.
As
he
*NL*
passed
through
the
Cathedral
Square
,
he
shook
his
fist
at
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
this
square
there
is
a
printing
establishment
.
It
is
*NL*
there
that
the
proclamations
of
the
Emperor
and
of
the
Imperial
Guard
*NL*
to
the
army
,
brought
from
the
Island
of
Elba
and
dictated
by
Napoleon
*NL*
himself
,
were
printed
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Worn
out
with
fatigue
,
and
no
longer
entertaining
any
hope
,
he
lay
down
*NL*
on
a
stone
bench
which
stands
at
the
doorway
of
this
printing
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
an
old
woman
came
out
of
the
church
.
She
saw
the
man
*NL*
stretched
out
in
the
shadow
.
``
What
are
you
doing
there
,
my
friend
?
''
said
*NL*
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
harshly
and
angrily
:
``
As
you
see
,
my
good
woman
,
I
am
*NL*
sleeping
.
''
The
good
woman
,
who
was
well
worthy
the
name
,
in
fact
,
was
*NL*
the
Marquise
de
R
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
this
bench
?
''
she
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
a
mattress
of
wood
for
nineteen
years
,
''
said
the
man
;
*NL*
``
to-day
I
have
a
mattress
of
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
a
soldier
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
good
woman
,
a
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
not
go
to
the
inn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
have
no
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
''
said
Madame
de
R
--
,
``
I
have
only
four
sous
in
my
purse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
took
the
four
sous
.
Madame
de
R
--
continued
:
``
You
can
not
*NL*
obtain
lodgings
in
an
inn
for
so
small
a
sum
.
But
have
you
tried
?
It
is
*NL*
impossible
for
you
to
pass
the
night
thus
.
You
are
cold
and
hungry
,
no
*NL*
doubt
.
Some
one
might
have
given
you
a
lodging
out
of
charity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
knocked
at
all
doors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
driven
away
everywhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
good
woman
''
touched
the
man
's
arm
,
and
pointed
out
to
him
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
street
a
small
,
low
house
,
which
stood
beside
the
*NL*
Bishop
's
palace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
knocked
at
all
doors
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
knocked
at
that
one
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*

Knock
there

CHAPTER
II
--
PRUDENCE
COUNSELLED
TO
WISDOM
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
the
Bishop
of
D
--
,
after
his
promenade
through
the
town
,
*NL*
remained
shut
up
rather
late
in
his
room
.
He
was
busy
over
a
great
work
*NL*
on
Duties
,
which
was
never
completed
,
unfortunately
.
He
was
carefully
*NL*
compiling
everything
that
the
Fathers
and
the
doctors
have
said
on
this
*NL*
important
subject
.
His
book
was
divided
into
two
parts
:
firstly
,
the
*NL*
duties
of
all
;
secondly
,
the
duties
of
each
individual
,
according
to
the
*NL*
class
to
which
he
belongs
.
The
duties
of
all
are
the
great
duties
.
There
*NL*
are
four
of
these
.
Saint
Matthew
points
them
out
:
duties
towards
God
*NL*
-LRB-
Matt
.
vi
.
-RRB-
;
duties
towards
one
's
self
-LRB-
Matt
.
v.
29
,
30
-RRB-
;
duties
towards
*NL*
one
's
neighbor
-LRB-
Matt
.
vii
.
12
-RRB-
;
duties
towards
animals
-LRB-
Matt
.
vi
.
20
,
*NL*
25
-RRB-
.
As
for
the
other
duties
the
Bishop
found
them
pointed
out
and
*NL*
prescribed
elsewhere
:
to
sovereigns
and
subjects
,
in
the
Epistle
to
the
*NL*
Romans
;
to
magistrates
,
to
wives
,
to
mothers
,
to
young
men
,
by
Saint
*NL*
Peter
;
to
husbands
,
fathers
,
children
and
servants
,
in
the
Epistle
*NL*
to
the
Ephesians
;
to
the
faithful
,
in
the
Epistle
to
the
Hebrews
;
to
*NL*
virgins
,
in
the
Epistle
to
the
Corinthians
.
Out
of
these
precepts
he
was
*NL*
laboriously
constructing
a
harmonious
whole
,
which
he
desired
to
present
*NL*
to
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
he
was
still
at
work
,
writing
with
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
inconvenience
upon
little
squares
of
paper
,
with
a
big
book
open
on
his
*NL*
knees
,
when
Madame
Magloire
entered
,
according
to
her
wont
,
to
get
the
*NL*
silver-ware
from
the
cupboard
near
his
bed
.
A
moment
later
,
the
Bishop
,
*NL*
knowing
that
the
table
was
set
,
and
that
his
sister
was
probably
*NL*
waiting
for
him
,
shut
his
book
,
rose
from
his
table
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dining-room
was
an
oblong
apartment
,
with
a
fireplace
,
which
had
a
*NL*
door
opening
on
the
street
-LRB-
as
we
have
said
-RRB-
,
and
a
window
opening
on
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
was
,
in
fact
,
just
putting
the
last
touches
to
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
performed
this
service
,
she
was
conversing
with
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lamp
stood
on
the
table
;
the
table
was
near
the
fireplace
.
A
wood
fire
*NL*
was
burning
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
can
easily
picture
to
one
's
self
these
two
women
,
both
of
whom
*NL*
were
over
sixty
years
of
age
.
Madame
Magloire
small
,
plump
,
vivacious
;
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
gentle
,
slender
,
frail
,
somewhat
taller
than
her
*NL*
brother
,
dressed
in
a
gown
of
puce-colored
silk
,
of
the
fashion
of
1806
,
*NL*
which
she
had
purchased
at
that
date
in
Paris
,
and
which
had
lasted
*NL*
ever
since
.
To
borrow
vulgar
phrases
,
which
possess
the
merit
of
giving
*NL*
utterance
in
a
single
word
to
an
idea
which
a
whole
page
would
hardly
*NL*
suffice
to
express
,
Madame
Magloire
had
the
air
of
a
peasant
,
and
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
that
of
a
lady
.
Madame
Magloire
wore
a
white
*NL*
quilted
cap
,
a
gold
Jeannette
cross
on
a
velvet
ribbon
upon
her
neck
,
*NL*
the
only
bit
of
feminine
jewelry
that
there
was
in
the
house
,
a
very
*NL*
white
fichu
puffing
out
from
a
gown
of
coarse
black
woollen
stuff
,
with
*NL*
large
,
short
sleeves
,
an
apron
of
cotton
cloth
in
red
and
green
checks
,
*NL*
knotted
round
the
waist
with
a
green
ribbon
,
with
a
stomacher
of
the
*NL*
same
attached
by
two
pins
at
the
upper
corners
,
coarse
shoes
on
her
*NL*
feet
,
and
yellow
stockings
,
like
the
women
of
Marseilles
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
's
gown
was
cut
on
the
patterns
of
1806
,
with
a
short
waist
,
*NL*
a
narrow
,
sheath-like
skirt
,
puffed
sleeves
,
with
flaps
and
buttons
.
*NL*
She
concealed
her
gray
hair
under
a
frizzed
wig
known
as
the
baby
wig
.
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
had
an
intelligent
,
vivacious
,
and
kindly
air
;
the
two
*NL*
corners
of
her
mouth
unequally
raised
,
and
her
upper
lip
,
which
was
*NL*
larger
than
the
lower
,
imparted
to
her
a
rather
crabbed
and
imperious
*NL*
look
.
So
long
as
Monseigneur
held
his
peace
,
she
talked
to
him
*NL*
resolutely
with
a
mixture
of
respect
and
freedom
;
but
as
soon
as
*NL*
Monseigneur
began
to
speak
,
as
we
have
seen
,
she
obeyed
passively
like
*NL*
her
mistress
.
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
did
not
even
speak
.
She
confined
*NL*
herself
to
obeying
and
pleasing
him
.
She
had
never
been
pretty
,
even
*NL*
when
she
was
young
;
she
had
large
,
blue
,
prominent
eyes
,
and
a
long
*NL*
arched
nose
;
but
her
whole
visage
,
her
whole
person
,
breathed
forth
an
*NL*
ineffable
goodness
,
as
we
stated
in
the
beginning
.
She
had
always
been
*NL*
predestined
to
gentleness
;
but
faith
,
charity
,
hope
,
those
three
virtues
*NL*
which
mildly
warm
the
soul
,
had
gradually
elevated
that
gentleness
to
*NL*
sanctity
.
Nature
had
made
her
a
lamb
,
religion
had
made
her
an
angel
.
*NL*
Poor
sainted
virgin
!
Sweet
memory
which
has
vanished
!
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
has
so
often
narrated
what
passed
at
the
*NL*
episcopal
residence
that
evening
,
that
there
are
many
people
now
living
*NL*
who
still
recall
the
most
minute
details
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
Bishop
entered
,
Madame
Magloire
was
talking
with
*NL*
considerable
vivacity
.
She
was
haranguing
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
on
*NL*
a
subject
which
was
familiar
to
her
and
to
which
the
Bishop
was
also
*NL*
accustomed
.
The
question
concerned
the
lock
upon
the
entrance
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
that
while
procuring
some
provisions
for
supper
,
Madame
*NL*
Magloire
had
heard
things
in
divers
places
.
People
had
spoken
of
a
*NL*
prowler
of
evil
appearance
;
a
suspicious
vagabond
had
arrived
who
must
*NL*
be
somewhere
about
the
town
,
and
those
who
should
take
it
into
their
*NL*
heads
to
return
home
late
that
night
might
be
subjected
to
unpleasant
*NL*
encounters
.
The
police
was
very
badly
organized
,
moreover
,
because
there
*NL*
was
no
love
lost
between
the
Prefect
and
the
Mayor
,
who
sought
to
injure
*NL*
each
other
by
making
things
happen
.
It
behooved
wise
people
to
play
the
*NL*
part
of
their
own
police
,
and
to
guard
themselves
well
,
and
care
must
be
*NL*
taken
to
duly
close
,
bar
and
barricade
their
houses
,
and
to
fasten
the
*NL*
doors
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
emphasized
these
last
words
;
but
the
Bishop
had
just
*NL*
come
from
his
room
,
where
it
was
rather
cold
.
He
seated
himself
in
front
*NL*
of
the
fire
,
and
warmed
himself
,
and
then
fell
to
thinking
of
other
*NL*
things
.
He
did
not
take
up
the
remark
dropped
with
design
by
Madame
*NL*
Magloire
.
She
repeated
it
.
Then
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
,
desirous
of
*NL*
satisfying
Madame
Magloire
without
displeasing
her
brother
,
ventured
to
*NL*
say
timidly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
what
Madame
Magloire
is
saying
,
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
something
of
it
in
a
vague
way
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
.
Then
*NL*
half-turning
in
his
chair
,
placing
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
and
raising
*NL*
towards
the
old
servant
woman
his
cordial
face
,
which
so
easily
grew
*NL*
joyous
,
and
which
was
illuminated
from
below
by
the
firelight
,
--
``
Come
,
*NL*
what
is
the
matter
?
What
is
the
matter
?
Are
we
in
any
great
danger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Madame
Magloire
began
the
whole
story
afresh
,
exaggerating
it
a
*NL*
little
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
.
It
appeared
that
a
Bohemian
,
a
*NL*
bare-footed
vagabond
,
a
sort
of
dangerous
mendicant
,
was
at
that
moment
*NL*
in
the
town
.
He
had
presented
himself
at
Jacquin
Labarre
's
to
obtain
*NL*
lodgings
,
but
the
latter
had
not
been
willing
to
take
him
in
.
He
had
*NL*
been
seen
to
arrive
by
the
way
of
the
boulevard
Gassendi
and
roam
about
*NL*
the
streets
in
the
gloaming
.
A
gallows-bird
with
a
terrible
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
willingness
to
interrogate
encouraged
Madame
Magloire
;
it
seemed
*NL*
to
her
to
indicate
that
the
Bishop
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
alarmed
;
*NL*
she
pursued
triumphantly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Monseigneur
.
That
is
how
it
is
.
There
will
be
some
sort
of
*NL*
catastrophe
in
this
town
to-night
.
Every
one
says
so
.
And
withal
,
the
*NL*
police
is
so
badly
regulated
''
-LRB-
a
useful
repetition
-RRB-
.
``
The
idea
of
living
*NL*
in
a
mountainous
country
,
and
not
even
having
lights
in
the
streets
at
*NL*
night
!
One
goes
out
.
Black
as
ovens
,
indeed
!
And
I
say
,
Monseigneur
,
and
*NL*
Mademoiselle
there
says
with
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
interrupted
his
sister
,
``
say
nothing
.
What
my
brother
does
is
well
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
continued
as
though
there
had
been
no
protest
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
say
that
this
house
is
not
safe
at
all
;
that
if
Monseigneur
will
*NL*
permit
,
I
will
go
and
tell
Paulin
Musebois
,
the
locksmith
,
to
come
and
*NL*
replace
the
ancient
locks
on
the
doors
;
we
have
them
,
and
it
is
only
the
*NL*
work
of
a
moment
;
for
I
say
that
nothing
is
more
terrible
than
a
*NL*
door
which
can
be
opened
from
the
outside
with
a
latch
by
the
first
*NL*
passer-by
;
and
I
say
that
we
need
bolts
,
Monseigneur
,
if
only
for
this
*NL*
night
;
moreover
,
Monseigneur
has
the
habit
of
always
saying
`
come
in
'
;
*NL*
and
besides

even
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
O
mon
Dieu
!
there
is
no
*NL*
need
to
ask
permission

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
there
came
a
tolerably
violent
knock
on
the
door
.

Come

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
HEROISM
OF
PASSIVE
OBEDIENCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
opened
wide
with
a
rapid
movement
,
as
though
some
one
had
given
it
an
*NL*
energetic
and
resolute
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
already
know
the
man
.
It
was
the
wayfarer
whom
we
have
seen
wandering
*NL*
about
in
search
of
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
,
advanced
a
step
,
and
halted
,
leaving
the
door
open
behind
*NL*
him
.
He
had
his
knapsack
on
his
shoulders
,
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
,
a
*NL*
rough
,
audacious
,
weary
,
and
violent
expression
in
his
eyes
.
The
fire
on
*NL*
the
hearth
lighted
him
up
.
He
was
hideous
.
It
was
a
sinister
apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
had
not
even
the
strength
to
utter
a
cry
.
She
trembled
,
*NL*
and
stood
with
her
mouth
wide
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
turned
round
,
beheld
the
man
entering
,
and
half
*NL*
started
up
in
terror
;
then
,
turning
her
head
by
degrees
towards
the
*NL*
fireplace
again
,
she
began
to
observe
her
brother
,
and
her
face
became
*NL*
once
more
profoundly
calm
and
serene
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
fixed
a
tranquil
eye
on
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
opened
his
mouth
,
doubtless
to
ask
the
new-comer
what
he
desired
,
*NL*
the
man
rested
both
hands
on
his
staff
,
directed
his
gaze
at
the
old
man
*NL*
and
the
two
women
,
and
without
waiting
for
the
Bishop
to
speak
,
he
said
,
*NL*
in
a
loud
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
.
My
name
is
Jean
Valjean
.
I
am
a
convict
from
the
galleys
.
*NL*
I
have
passed
nineteen
years
in
the
galleys
.
I
was
liberated
four
days
*NL*
ago
,
and
am
on
my
way
to
Pontarlier
,
which
is
my
destination
.
I
have
*NL*
been
walking
for
four
days
since
I
left
Toulon
.
I
have
travelled
a
dozen
*NL*
leagues
to-day
on
foot
.
This
evening
,
when
I
arrived
in
these
parts
,
I
*NL*
went
to
an
inn
,
and
they
turned
me
out
,
because
of
my
yellow
passport
,
*NL*
which
I
had
shown
at
the
town-hall
.
I
had
to
do
it
.
I
went
to
an
inn
.
*NL*
They
said
to
me
,
`
Be
off
,
'
at
both
places
.
No
one
would
take
me
.
I
*NL*
went
to
the
prison
;
the
jailer
would
not
admit
me
.
I
went
into
a
dog
's
*NL*
kennel
;
the
dog
bit
me
and
chased
me
off
,
as
though
he
had
been
a
man
.
*NL*
One
would
have
said
that
he
knew
who
I
was
.
I
went
into
the
fields
,
*NL*
intending
to
sleep
in
the
open
air
,
beneath
the
stars
.
There
were
no
*NL*
stars
.
I
thought
it
was
going
to
rain
,
and
I
re-entered
the
town
,
to
*NL*
seek
the
recess
of
a
doorway
.
Yonder
,
in
the
square
,
I
meant
to
sleep
*NL*
on
a
stone
bench
.
A
good
woman
pointed
out
your
house
to
me
,
and
said
*NL*
to
me
,
`
Knock
there
!
'
I
have
knocked
.
What
is
this
place
?
Do
you
keep
*NL*
an
inn
?
I
have
money
--
savings
.
One
hundred
and
nine
francs
fifteen
sous
,
*NL*
which
I
earned
in
the
galleys
by
my
labor
,
in
the
course
of
nineteen
*NL*
years
.
I
will
pay
.
What
is
that
to
me
?
I
have
money
.
I
am
very
weary
;
*NL*
twelve
leagues
on
foot
;
I
am
very
hungry
.
Are
you
willing
that
I
should
*NL*
remain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Magloire
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
you
will
set
another
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
advanced
three
paces
,
and
approached
the
lamp
which
was
on
*NL*
the
table
.
``
Stop
,
''
he
resumed
,
as
though
he
had
not
quite
understood
;
*NL*
``
that
's
not
it
.
Did
you
hear
?
I
am
a
galley-slave
;
a
convict
.
I
come
*NL*
from
the
galleys
.
''
He
drew
from
his
pocket
a
large
sheet
of
yellow
*NL*
paper
,
which
he
unfolded
.
``
Here
's
my
passport
.
Yellow
,
as
you
see
.
This
*NL*
serves
to
expel
me
from
every
place
where
I
go
.
Will
you
read
it
?
I
know
*NL*
how
to
read
.
I
learned
in
the
galleys
.
There
is
a
school
there
for
those
*NL*
who
choose
to
learn
.
Hold
,
this
is
what
they
put
on
this
passport
:
`
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
discharged
convict
,
native
of
'
--
that
is
nothing
to
you
--
`
has
*NL*
been
nineteen
years
in
the
galleys
:
five
years
for
house-breaking
*NL*
and
burglary
;
fourteen
years
for
having
attempted
to
escape
on
four
*NL*
occasions
.
He
is
a
very
dangerous
man
.
'
There
!
Every
one
has
cast
me
*NL*
out
.
Are
you
willing
to
receive
me
?
Is
this
an
inn
?
Will
you
give
me
*NL*
something
to
eat
and
a
bed
?
Have
you
a
stable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Magloire
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
you
will
put
white
sheets
on
the
*NL*
bed
in
the
alcove
.
''
We
have
already
explained
the
character
of
the
two
*NL*
women
's
obedience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
retired
to
execute
these
orders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
turned
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
sir
,
and
warm
yourself
.
We
are
going
to
sup
in
a
few
moments
,
*NL*
and
your
bed
will
be
prepared
while
you
are
supping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
the
man
suddenly
comprehended
.
The
expression
of
his
face
,
*NL*
up
to
that
time
sombre
and
harsh
,
bore
the
imprint
of
stupefaction
,
*NL*
of
doubt
,
of
joy
,
and
became
extraordinary
.
He
began
stammering
like
a
*NL*
crazy
man
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
What
!
You
will
keep
me
?
You
do
not
drive
me
forth
?
A
convict
!
*NL*
You
call
me
sir
!
You
do
not
address
me
as
thou
?
`
Get
out
of
here
,
you
*NL*
dog
!
'
is
what
people
always
say
to
me
.
I
felt
sure
that
you
would
expel
*NL*
me
,
so
I
told
you
at
once
who
I
am
.
Oh
,
what
a
good
woman
that
was
who
*NL*
directed
me
hither
!
I
am
going
to
sup
!
A
bed
with
a
mattress
and
sheets
,
*NL*
like
the
rest
of
the
world
!
a
bed
!
It
is
nineteen
years
since
I
have
*NL*
slept
in
a
bed
!
You
actually
do
not
want
me
to
go
!
You
are
good
*NL*
people
.
Besides
,
I
have
money
.
I
will
pay
well
.
Pardon
me
,
monsieur
the
*NL*
inn-keeper
,
but
what
is
your
name
?
I
will
pay
anything
you
ask
.
You
are
*NL*
a
fine
man
.
You
are
an
inn-keeper
,
are
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
,
``
a
priest
who
lives
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
priest
!
''
said
the
man
.
``
Oh
,
what
a
fine
priest
!
Then
you
are
not
*NL*
going
to
demand
any
money
of
me
?
You
are
the
cure
,
are
you
not
?
the
cure
*NL*
of
this
big
church
?
Well
!
I
am
a
fool
,
truly
!
I
had
not
perceived
your
*NL*
skull-cap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
he
deposited
his
knapsack
and
his
cudgel
in
a
corner
,
*NL*
replaced
his
passport
in
his
pocket
,
and
seated
himself
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
gazed
mildly
at
him
.
He
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
humane
,
Monsieur
le
Cure
;
you
have
not
scorned
me
.
A
good
*NL*
priest
is
a
very
good
thing
.
Then
you
do
not
require
me
to
pay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
Bishop
;
``
keep
your
money
.
How
much
have
you
?
Did
you
not
*NL*
tell
me
one
hundred
and
nine
francs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
fifteen
sous
,
''
added
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
hundred
and
nine
francs
fifteen
sous
.
And
how
long
did
it
take
you
*NL*
to
earn
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
years
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
continued
:
``
I
have
still
the
whole
of
my
money
.
In
four
days
I
*NL*
have
spent
only
twenty-five
sous
,
which
I
earned
by
helping
unload
some
*NL*
wagons
at
Grasse
.
Since
you
are
an
abbe
,
I
will
tell
you
that
we
had
a
*NL*
chaplain
in
the
galleys
.
And
one
day
I
saw
a
bishop
there
.
Monseigneur
*NL*
is
what
they
call
him
.
He
was
the
Bishop
of
Majore
at
Marseilles
.
He
is
*NL*
the
cure
who
rules
over
the
other
cures
,
you
understand
.
Pardon
me
,
*NL*
I
say
that
very
badly
;
but
it
is
such
a
far-off
thing
to
me
!
You
*NL*
understand
what
we
are
!
He
said
mass
in
the
middle
of
the
galleys
,
on
an
*NL*
altar
.
He
had
a
pointed
thing
,
made
of
gold
,
on
his
head
;
it
glittered
*NL*
in
the
bright
light
of
midday
.
We
were
all
ranged
in
lines
on
the
three
*NL*
sides
,
with
cannons
with
lighted
matches
facing
us
.
We
could
not
see
*NL*
very
well
.
He
spoke
;
but
he
was
too
far
off
,
and
we
did
not
hear
.
That
*NL*
is
what
a
bishop
is
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
speaking
,
the
Bishop
had
gone
and
shut
the
door
,
which
had
*NL*
remained
wide
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
returned
.
She
brought
a
silver
fork
and
spoon
,
which
she
*NL*
placed
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Magloire
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
place
those
things
as
near
the
fire
*NL*
as
possible
.
''
And
turning
to
his
guest
:
``
The
night
wind
is
harsh
on
the
*NL*
Alps
.
You
must
be
cold
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
time
that
he
uttered
the
word
sir
,
in
his
voice
which
was
so
gently
*NL*
grave
and
polished
,
the
man
's
face
lighted
up
.
Monsieur
to
a
convict
is
*NL*
like
a
glass
of
water
to
one
of
the
shipwrecked
of
the
Medusa
.
Ignominy
*NL*
thirsts
for
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
lamp
gives
a
very
bad
light
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
understood
him
,
and
went
to
get
the
two
silver
*NL*
candlesticks
from
the
chimney-piece
in
Monseigneur
's
bed-chamber
,
and
*NL*
placed
them
,
lighted
,
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le

said
the
man
,
``
you
are
good

you
do
not
despise
me

You
receive
me
into
your
house

You
light
your
candles
for
me

Yet
I
*NL*
have
not
concealed
from
you
whence
I
come
and
that
I
am
an
unfortunate
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
,
who
was
sitting
close
to
him
,
gently
touched
his
hand
.
``
You
*NL*
could
not
help
telling
me
who
you
were

This
is
not
my
house
;
it
is
*NL*
the
house
of
Jesus
Christ
.
This
door
does
not
demand
of
him
who
enters
*NL*
whether
he
has
a
name
,
but
whether
he
has
a
grief
.
You
suffer
,
you
are
*NL*
hungry
and
thirsty
;
you
are
welcome

And
do
not
thank
me

do
not
say

that
I
receive
you
in
my
house

No
one
is
at
home
here

except
the
man
*NL*
who
needs
a
refuge

I
say
to
you
,
who
are
passing
by
,
that
you
are
much
*NL*
more
at
home
here
than
I
am
myself

Everything
here
is
yours
.
What
need
*NL*
have
I
to
know
your
name
?
Besides
,
before
you
told
me
you
had
one
which
*NL*
I
knew

*NL*
*NL*
The
man
opened
his
eyes
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
You
knew
what
I
was
called
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

replied
the
Bishop
,
``
you
are
called
my
brother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop

Monsieur
le
Cure

exclaimed
the
man
.
``
I
was
very
hungry
when
*NL*
I
entered
here

you
are
so
good

that
I
no

know
what
has
*NL*
happened
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
looked
at
him
,
and
said
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
suffered
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

the
red
coat

the
ball
on

ankle

a
plank

sleep
on

heat

cold

toil

the

Nineteen

I

forty-six

Now
there
is
the
yellow
*NL*
passport

That
is
what
it
is
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
resumed
the
Bishop
,
``
you
have
come
from
a
very
sad
place

Listen
.
There
will
be
more
joy
in
heaven
over
the
tear-bathed
face
of
a
*NL*
repentant
sinner
than
over
the
white
robes
of
a
hundred
just
men

If

emerge
from
that
sad
place
with
thoughts
of
hatred

of
wrath
against

mankind

you
are
deserving
of
pity
;
if
you
emerge
with
thoughts

good-will

of
peace

you
are
more
worthy
than
any
one

In
the
meantime
,
Madame
Magloire
had
served
supper
:
soup
,
made
with

water

oil

bread

and
salt
;
a

bacon

.
She
had
,
of
her
own
accord
,
*NL*
added
to
the
Bishop
's
ordinary
fare
a
bottle
of
his
old
Mauves
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
's
face
at
once
assumed
that
expression
of
gayety
which
is
*NL*
peculiar
to
hospitable
natures
.
``
To
table
!
''
he
cried
vivaciously
.
As
was
*NL*
his
custom
when
a
stranger
supped
with
him
,
he
made
the
man
sit
on
his
*NL*
right
.
Mademoiselle
Baptistine
,
perfectly
peaceable
and
natural
,
took
*NL*
her
seat
at
his
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
asked
a
blessing
;
then
helped
the
soup
himself
,
according
to
*NL*
his
custom
.
The
man
began
to
eat
with
avidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
Bishop
said
:
``
It
strikes
me
there
is
something
missing
*NL*
on
this
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
had
,
in
fact
,
only
placed
the
three
sets
of
forks
and
*NL*
spoons
which
were
absolutely
necessary
.
Now
,
it
was
the
usage
of
the
*NL*
house
,
when
the
Bishop
had
any
one
to
supper
,
to
lay
out
the
whole
*NL*
six
sets
of
silver
on
the
table-cloth
--
an
innocent
ostentation
.
This
*NL*
graceful
semblance
of
luxury
was
a
kind
of
child
's
play
,
which
was
full
*NL*
of
charm
in
that
gentle
and
severe
household
,
which
raised
poverty
into
*NL*
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
understood
the
remark
,
went
out
without
saying
a
word
,
*NL*
and
a
moment
later
the
three
sets
of
silver
forks
and
spoons
demanded
by
*NL*
the
Bishop
were
glittering
upon
the
cloth
,
symmetrically
arranged
before
*NL*
the
three
persons
seated
at
the
table

CHAPTER
IV
--
DETAILS
CONCERNING
THE
CHEESE-DAIRIES
OF
PONTARLIER
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
order
to
convey
an
idea
of
what
passed
at
that
table
,
we
can
not
*NL*
do
better
than
to
transcribe
here
a
passage
from
one
of
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Baptistine
's
letters
to
Madame
Boischevron
,
wherein
the
conversation
*NL*
between
the
convict
and
the
Bishop
is
described
with
ingenious
*NL*
minuteness
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
This
man
paid
no
attention
to
any
one
.
He
ate
with
the
voracity
*NL*
of
a
starving
man
.
However
,
after
supper
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Monsieur
le
Cure
of
the
good
God
,
all
this
is
far
too
good
for
me
;
but
*NL*
I
must
say
that
the
carters
who
would
not
allow
me
to
eat
with
them
keep
*NL*
a
better
table
than
you
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Between
ourselves
,
the
remark
rather
shocked
me
.
My
brother
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
They
are
more
fatigued
than
I.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
No
,
'
returned
the
man
,
`
they
have
more
money
.
You
are
poor
;
I
see
that
*NL*
plainly
.
You
can
not
be
even
a
curate
.
Are
you
really
a
cure
?
Ah
,
if
the
*NL*
good
God
were
but
just
,
you
certainly
ought
to
be
a
cure
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
The
good
God
is
more
than
just
,
'
said
my
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
moment
later
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Monsieur
Jean
Valjean
,
is
it
to
Pontarlier
that
you
are
going
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
With
my
road
marked
out
for
me
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
is
what
the
man
said
.
Then
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
must
be
on
my
way
by
daybreak
to-morrow
.
Travelling
is
hard
.
If
the
*NL*
nights
are
cold
,
the
days
are
hot
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
are
going
to
a
good
country
,
'
said
my
brother
.
`
During
the
*NL*
Revolution
my
family
was
ruined
.
I
took
refuge
in
Franche-Comte
at
*NL*
first
,
and
there
I
lived
for
some
time
by
the
toil
of
my
hands
.
My
will
*NL*
was
good
.
I
found
plenty
to
occupy
me
.
One
has
only
to
choose
.
There
are
*NL*
paper
mills
,
tanneries
,
distilleries
,
oil
factories
,
watch
factories
*NL*
on
a
large
scale
,
steel
mills
,
copper
works
,
twenty
iron
foundries
at
*NL*
least
,
four
of
which
,
situated
at
Lods
,
at
Chatillon
,
at
Audincourt
,
and
*NL*
at
Beure
,
are
tolerably
large
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
am
not
mistaken
in
saying
that
those
are
the
names
which
my
*NL*
brother
mentioned
.
Then
he
interrupted
himself
and
addressed
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Have
we
not
some
relatives
in
those
parts
,
my
dear
sister
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
replied
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
We
did
have
some
;
among
others
,
M.
de
Lucenet
,
who
was
captain
of
the
*NL*
gates
at
Pontarlier
under
the
old
regime
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
,
'
resumed
my
brother
;
`
but
in
'
93
,
one
had
no
longer
any
*NL*
relatives
,
one
had
only
one
's
arms
.
I
worked
.
They
have
,
in
the
*NL*
country
of
Pontarlier
,
whither
you
are
going
,
Monsieur
Valjean
,
a
*NL*
truly
patriarchal
and
truly
charming
industry
,
my
sister
.
It
is
their
*NL*
cheese-dairies
,
which
they
call
fruitieres
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
my
brother
,
while
urging
the
man
to
eat
,
explained
to
him
,
with
*NL*
great
minuteness
,
what
these
fruitieres
of
Pontarlier
were
;
that
they
*NL*
were
divided
into
two
classes
:
the
big
barns
which
belong
to
the
rich
,
*NL*
and
where
there
are
forty
or
fifty
cows
which
produce
from
seven
to
*NL*
eight
thousand
cheeses
each
summer
,
and
the
associated
fruitieres
,
which
*NL*
belong
to
the
poor
;
these
are
the
peasants
of
mid-mountain
,
who
hold
*NL*
their
cows
in
common
,
and
share
the
proceeds
.
`
They
engage
the
services
*NL*
of
a
cheese-maker
,
whom
they
call
the
grurin
;
the
grurin
receives
the
*NL*
milk
of
the
associates
three
times
a
day
,
and
marks
the
quantity
on
*NL*
a
double
tally
.
It
is
towards
the
end
of
April
that
the
work
of
the
*NL*
cheese-dairies
begins
;
it
is
towards
the
middle
of
June
that
the
*NL*
cheese-makers
drive
their
cows
to
the
mountains
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
recovered
his
animation
as
he
ate
.
My
brother
made
him
drink
*NL*
that
good
Mauves
wine
,
which
he
does
not
drink
himself
,
because
he
says
*NL*
that
wine
is
expensive
.
My
brother
imparted
all
these
details
with
that
*NL*
easy
gayety
of
his
with
which
you
are
acquainted
,
interspersing
his
*NL*
words
with
graceful
attentions
to
me
.
He
recurred
frequently
to
that
*NL*
comfortable
trade
of
grurin
,
as
though
he
wished
the
man
to
understand
,
*NL*
without
advising
him
directly
and
harshly
,
that
this
would
afford
him
*NL*
a
refuge
.
One
thing
struck
me
.
This
man
was
what
I
have
told
you
.
Well
,
*NL*
neither
during
supper
,
nor
during
the
entire
evening
,
did
my
brother
*NL*
utter
a
single
word
,
with
the
exception
of
a
few
words
about
Jesus
when
*NL*
he
entered
,
which
could
remind
the
man
of
what
he
was
,
nor
of
what
my
*NL*
brother
was
.
To
all
appearances
,
it
was
an
occasion
for
preaching
him
*NL*
a
little
sermon
,
and
of
impressing
the
Bishop
on
the
convict
,
so
that
a
*NL*
mark
of
the
passage
might
remain
behind
.
This
might
have
appeared
to
any
*NL*
one
else
who
had
this
,
unfortunate
man
in
his
hands
to
afford
a
chance
*NL*
to
nourish
his
soul
as
well
as
his
body
,
and
to
bestow
upon
him
*NL*
some
reproach
,
seasoned
with
moralizing
and
advice
,
or
a
little
*NL*
commiseration
,
with
an
exhortation
to
conduct
himself
better
in
the
*NL*
future
.
My
brother
did
not
even
ask
him
from
what
country
he
came
,
*NL*
nor
what
was
his
history
.
For
in
his
history
there
is
a
fault
,
and
my
*NL*
brother
seemed
to
avoid
everything
which
could
remind
him
of
it
.
To
such
*NL*
a
point
did
he
carry
it
,
that
at
one
time
,
when
my
brother
was
speaking
*NL*
of
the
mountaineers
of
Pontarlier
,
who
exercise
a
gentle
labor
near
*NL*
heaven
,
and
who
,
he
added
,
are
happy
because
they
are
innocent
,
he
*NL*
stopped
short
,
fearing
lest
in
this
remark
there
might
have
escaped
him
*NL*
something
which
might
wound
the
man
.
By
dint
of
reflection
,
I
think
*NL*
I
have
comprehended
what
was
passing
in
my
brother
's
heart
.
He
was
*NL*
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
that
this
man
,
whose
name
is
Jean
Valjean
,
had
his
*NL*
misfortune
only
too
vividly
present
in
his
mind
;
that
the
best
thing
*NL*
was
to
divert
him
from
it
,
and
to
make
him
believe
,
if
only
momentarily
,
*NL*
that
he
was
a
person
like
any
other
,
by
treating
him
just
in
his
*NL*
ordinary
way
.
Is
not
this
indeed
,
to
understand
charity
well
?
Is
there
*NL*
not
,
dear
Madame
,
something
truly
evangelical
in
this
delicacy
which
*NL*
abstains
from
sermon
,
from
moralizing
,
from
allusions
?
and
is
not
the
*NL*
truest
pity
,
when
a
man
has
a
sore
point
,
not
to
touch
it
at
all
?
It
has
*NL*
seemed
to
me
that
this
might
have
been
my
brother
's
private
thought
.
In
*NL*
any
case
,
what
I
can
say
is
that
,
if
he
entertained
all
these
ideas
,
he
*NL*
gave
no
sign
of
them
;
from
beginning
to
end
,
even
to
me
he
was
the
same
*NL*
as
he
is
every
evening
,
and
he
supped
with
this
Jean
Valjean
with
the
*NL*
same
air
and
in
the
same
manner
in
which
he
would
have
supped
with
M.
*NL*
Gedeon
le
Provost
,
or
with
the
curate
of
the
parish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Towards
the
end
,
when
he
had
reached
the
figs
,
there
came
a
knock
at
*NL*
the
door
.
It
was
Mother
Gerbaud
,
with
her
little
one
in
her
arms
.
My
*NL*
brother
kissed
the
child
on
the
brow
,
and
borrowed
fifteen
sous
which
I
*NL*
had
about
me
to
give
to
Mother
Gerbaud
.
The
man
was
not
paying
much
*NL*
heed
to
anything
then
.
He
was
no
longer
talking
,
and
he
seemed
very
much
*NL*
fatigued
.
After
poor
old
Gerbaud
had
taken
her
departure
,
my
brother
*NL*
said
grace
;
then
he
turned
to
the
man
and
said
to
him
,
`
You
must
be
*NL*
in
great
need
of
your
bed
.
'
Madame
Magloire
cleared
the
table
very
*NL*
promptly
.
I
understood
that
we
must
retire
,
in
order
to
allow
this
*NL*
traveller
to
go
to
sleep
,
and
we
both
went
up
stairs
.
Nevertheless
,
I
*NL*
sent
Madame
Magloire
down
a
moment
later
,
to
carry
to
the
man
's
bed
a
*NL*
goat
skin
from
the
Black
Forest
,
which
was
in
my
room
.
The
nights
are
*NL*
frigid
,
and
that
keeps
one
warm
.
It
is
a
pity
that
this
skin
is
old
;
all
*NL*
the
hair
is
falling
out
.
My
brother
bought
it
while
he
was
in
Germany
,
*NL*
at
Tottlingen
,
near
the
sources
of
the
Danube
,
as
well
as
the
little
*NL*
ivory-handled
knife
which
I
use
at
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Magloire
returned
immediately
.
We
said
our
prayers
in
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
where
we
hang
up
the
linen
,
and
then
we
each
retired
to
*NL*
our
own
chambers
,
without
saying
a
word
to
each
other

CHAPTER
V
--
TRANQUILLITY
*NL*
*NL*
After
bidding
his
sister
good
night
,
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
took
one
of
*NL*
the
two
silver
candlesticks
from
the
table
,
handed
the
other
to
his
*NL*
guest
,
and
said
to
him
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
I
will
conduct
you
to
your
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
followed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
might
have
been
observed
from
what
has
been
said
above
,
the
house
was
*NL*
so
arranged
that
in
order
to
pass
into
the
oratory
where
the
alcove
was
*NL*
situated
,
or
to
get
out
of
it
,
it
was
necessary
to
traverse
the
Bishop
's
*NL*
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
was
crossing
this
apartment
,
Madame
Magloire
was
*NL*
putting
away
the
silverware
in
the
cupboard
near
the
head
of
the
bed
.
*NL*
This
was
her
last
care
every
evening
before
she
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
installed
his
guest
in
the
alcove
.
A
fresh
white
bed
had
been
*NL*
prepared
there
.
The
man
set
the
candle
down
on
a
small
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
may
you
pass
a
good
night
.
To-morrow
morning
,
*NL*
before
you
set
out
,
you
shall
drink
a
cup
of
warm
milk
from
our
cows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Monsieur
l'Abbe
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
he
pronounced
these
words
full
of
peace
,
when
all
of
a
*NL*
sudden
,
and
without
transition
,
he
made
a
strange
movement
,
which
would
*NL*
have
frozen
the
two
sainted
women
with
horror
,
had
they
witnessed
it
.
*NL*
Even
at
this
day
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
explain
what
inspired
him
at
*NL*
that
moment
.
Did
he
intend
to
convey
a
warning
or
to
throw
out
a
menace
?
*NL*
Was
he
simply
obeying
a
sort
of
instinctive
impulse
which
was
obscure
*NL*
even
to
himself
?
He
turned
abruptly
to
the
old
man
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
bending
upon
his
host
a
savage
gaze
,
he
exclaimed
in
a
hoarse
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
really
!
You
lodge
me
in
your
house
,
close
to
yourself
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
off
,
and
added
with
a
laugh
in
which
there
lurked
something
*NL*
monstrous
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
really
reflected
well
?
How
do
you
know
that
I
have
not
been
an
*NL*
assassin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
concern
of
the
good
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
gravely
,
and
moving
his
lips
like
one
who
is
praying
or
talking
*NL*
to
himself
,
he
raised
two
fingers
of
his
right
hand
and
bestowed
his
*NL*
benediction
on
the
man
,
who
did
not
bow
,
and
without
turning
his
head
or
*NL*
looking
behind
him
,
he
returned
to
his
bedroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
alcove
was
in
use
,
a
large
serge
curtain
drawn
from
wall
to
*NL*
wall
concealed
the
altar
.
The
Bishop
knelt
before
this
curtain
as
he
*NL*
passed
and
said
a
brief
prayer
.
A
moment
later
he
was
in
his
garden
,
*NL*
walking
,
meditating
,
contemplating
,
his
heart
and
soul
wholly
absorbed
*NL*
in
those
grand
and
mysterious
things
which
God
shows
at
night
to
the
*NL*
eyes
which
remain
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
man
,
he
was
actually
so
fatigued
that
he
did
not
even
profit
*NL*
by
the
nice
white
sheets
.
Snuffing
out
his
candle
with
his
nostrils
*NL*
after
the
manner
of
convicts
,
he
dropped
,
all
dressed
as
he
was
,
upon
*NL*
the
bed
,
where
he
immediately
fell
into
a
profound
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Midnight
struck
as
the
Bishop
returned
from
his
garden
to
his
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
all
were
asleep
in
the
little
house

CHAPTER
VI
--
JEAN
VALJEAN
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
middle
of
the
night
Jean
Valjean
woke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
came
from
a
poor
peasant
family
of
Brie
.
He
had
not
learned
*NL*
to
read
in
his
childhood
.
When
he
reached
man
's
estate
,
he
became
a
*NL*
tree-pruner
at
Faverolles
.
His
mother
was
named
Jeanne
Mathieu
;
his
*NL*
father
was
called
Jean
Valjean
or
Vlajean
,
probably
a
sobriquet
,
and
a
*NL*
contraction
of
viola
Jean
,
``
here
's
Jean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
of
that
thoughtful
but
not
gloomy
disposition
which
*NL*
constitutes
the
peculiarity
of
affectionate
natures
.
On
the
whole
,
*NL*
however
,
there
was
something
decidedly
sluggish
and
insignificant
about
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
in
appearance
,
at
least
.
He
had
lost
his
father
and
mother
*NL*
at
a
very
early
age
.
His
mother
had
died
of
a
milk
fever
,
which
had
not
*NL*
been
properly
attended
to
.
His
father
,
a
tree-pruner
,
like
himself
,
had
*NL*
been
killed
by
a
fall
from
a
tree
.
All
that
remained
to
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
was
a
sister
older
than
himself
,
--
a
widow
with
seven
children
,
boys
and
*NL*
girls
.
This
sister
had
brought
up
Jean
Valjean
,
and
so
long
as
she
had
a
*NL*
husband
she
lodged
and
fed
her
young
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
died
.
The
eldest
of
the
seven
children
was
eight
years
old
.
*NL*
The
youngest
,
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
just
attained
his
twenty-fifth
year
.
He
took
the
*NL*
father
's
place
,
and
,
in
his
turn
,
supported
the
sister
who
had
brought
*NL*
him
up
.
This
was
done
simply
as
a
duty
and
even
a
little
churlishly
*NL*
on
the
part
of
Jean
Valjean
.
Thus
his
youth
had
been
spent
in
rude
and
*NL*
ill-paid
toil
.
He
had
never
known
a
``
kind
woman
friend
''
in
his
native
*NL*
parts
.
He
had
not
had
the
time
to
fall
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
at
night
weary
,
and
ate
his
broth
without
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
His
sister
,
mother
Jeanne
,
often
took
the
best
part
of
his
repast
from
*NL*
his
bowl
while
he
was
eating
,
--
a
bit
of
meat
,
a
slice
of
bacon
,
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
cabbage
,
--
to
give
to
one
of
her
children
.
As
he
went
on
*NL*
eating
,
with
his
head
bent
over
the
table
and
almost
into
his
soup
,
his
*NL*
long
hair
falling
about
his
bowl
and
concealing
his
eyes
,
he
had
the
air
*NL*
of
perceiving
nothing
and
allowing
it
.
There
was
at
Faverolles
,
not
*NL*
far
from
the
Valjean
thatched
cottage
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
lane
,
*NL*
a
farmer
's
wife
named
Marie-Claude
;
the
Valjean
children
,
habitually
*NL*
famished
,
sometimes
went
to
borrow
from
Marie-Claude
a
pint
of
milk
,
in
*NL*
their
mother
's
name
,
which
they
drank
behind
a
hedge
or
in
some
alley
*NL*
corner
,
snatching
the
jug
from
each
other
so
hastily
that
the
little
*NL*
girls
spilled
it
on
their
aprons
and
down
their
necks
.
If
their
mother
*NL*
had
known
of
this
marauding
,
she
would
have
punished
the
delinquents
*NL*
severely
.
Jean
Valjean
gruffly
and
grumblingly
paid
Marie-Claude
for
*NL*
the
pint
of
milk
behind
their
mother
's
back
,
and
the
children
were
not
*NL*
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
pruning
season
he
earned
eighteen
sous
a
day
;
then
he
hired
out
as
*NL*
a
hay-maker
,
as
laborer
,
as
neat-herd
on
a
farm
,
as
a
drudge
.
He
did
*NL*
whatever
he
could
.
His
sister
worked
also
but
what
could
she
do
with
*NL*
seven
little
children
?
It
was
a
sad
group
enveloped
in
misery
,
which
was
*NL*
being
gradually
annihilated
.
A
very
hard
winter
came
.
Jean
had
no
work
.
*NL*
The
family
had
no
bread
.
No
bread
literally
.
Seven
children
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
Sunday
evening
,
Maubert
Isabeau
,
the
baker
on
the
Church
Square
at
*NL*
Faverolles
,
was
preparing
to
go
to
bed
,
when
he
heard
a
violent
blow
on
*NL*
the
grated
front
of
his
shop
.
He
arrived
in
time
to
see
an
arm
passed
*NL*
through
a
hole
made
by
a
blow
from
a
fist
,
through
the
grating
and
the
*NL*
glass
.
The
arm
seized
a
loaf
of
bread
and
carried
it
off
.
Isabeau
ran
*NL*
out
in
haste
;
the
robber
fled
at
the
full
speed
of
his
legs
.
Isabeau
ran
*NL*
after
him
and
stopped
him
.
The
thief
had
flung
away
the
loaf
,
but
his
*NL*
arm
was
still
bleeding
.
It
was
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
place
in
1795
.
Jean
Valjean
was
taken
before
the
tribunals
*NL*
of
the
time
for
theft
and
breaking
and
entering
an
inhabited
house
at
*NL*
night
.
He
had
a
gun
which
he
used
better
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
,
*NL*
he
was
a
bit
of
a
poacher
,
and
this
injured
his
case
.
There
exists
a
*NL*
legitimate
prejudice
against
poachers
.
The
poacher
,
like
the
smuggler
,
*NL*
smacks
too
strongly
of
the
brigand
.
Nevertheless
,
we
will
remark
*NL*
cursorily
,
there
is
still
an
abyss
between
these
races
of
men
and
the
*NL*
hideous
assassin
of
the
towns
.
The
poacher
lives
in
the
forest
,
the
*NL*
smuggler
lives
in
the
mountains
or
on
the
sea
.
The
cities
make
ferocious
*NL*
men
because
they
make
corrupt
men
.
The
mountain
,
the
sea
,
the
forest
,
*NL*
make
savage
men
;
they
develop
the
fierce
side
,
but
often
without
*NL*
destroying
the
humane
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
pronounced
guilty
.
The
terms
of
the
Code
were
explicit
.
*NL*
There
occur
formidable
hours
in
our
civilization
;
there
are
moments
when
*NL*
the
penal
laws
decree
a
shipwreck
.
What
an
ominous
minute
is
that
in
*NL*
which
society
draws
back
and
consummates
the
irreparable
abandonment
*NL*
of
a
sentient
being
!
Jean
Valjean
was
condemned
to
five
years
in
the
*NL*
galleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
22d
of
April
,
1796
,
the
victory
of
Montenotte
,
won
by
the
*NL*
general-in-chief
of
the
army
of
Italy
,
whom
the
message
of
the
Directory
*NL*
to
the
Five
Hundred
,
of
the
2d
of
Floreal
,
year
IV.
,
calls
Buona-Parte
,
*NL*
was
announced
in
Paris
;
on
that
same
day
a
great
gang
of
galley-slaves
*NL*
was
put
in
chains
at
Bicetre
.
Jean
Valjean
formed
a
part
of
that
gang
.
*NL*
An
old
turnkey
of
the
prison
,
who
is
now
nearly
eighty
years
old
,
still
*NL*
recalls
perfectly
that
unfortunate
wretch
who
was
chained
to
the
end
of
*NL*
the
fourth
line
,
in
the
north
angle
of
the
courtyard
.
He
was
seated
on
*NL*
the
ground
like
the
others
.
He
did
not
seem
to
comprehend
his
position
,
*NL*
except
that
it
was
horrible
.
It
is
probable
that
he
,
also
,
was
*NL*
disentangling
from
amid
the
vague
ideas
of
a
poor
man
,
ignorant
of
*NL*
everything
,
something
excessive
.
While
the
bolt
of
his
iron
collar
was
*NL*
being
riveted
behind
his
head
with
heavy
blows
from
the
hammer
,
he
wept
,
*NL*
his
tears
stifled
him
,
they
impeded
his
speech
;
he
only
managed
to
*NL*
say
from
time
to
time
,
``
I
was
a
tree-pruner
at
Faverolles
.
''
Then
still
*NL*
sobbing
,
he
raised
his
right
hand
and
lowered
it
gradually
seven
times
,
*NL*
as
though
he
were
touching
in
succession
seven
heads
of
unequal
heights
,
*NL*
and
from
this
gesture
it
was
divined
that
the
thing
which
he
had
done
,
*NL*
whatever
it
was
,
he
had
done
for
the
sake
of
clothing
and
nourishing
*NL*
seven
little
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
for
Toulon
.
He
arrived
there
,
after
a
journey
of
twenty-seven
*NL*
days
,
on
a
cart
,
with
a
chain
on
his
neck
.
At
Toulon
he
was
clothed
in
*NL*
the
red
cassock
.
All
that
had
constituted
his
life
,
even
to
his
name
,
*NL*
was
effaced
;
he
was
no
longer
even
Jean
Valjean
;
he
was
number
24,601
.
*NL*
What
became
of
his
sister
?
What
became
of
the
seven
children
?
Who
*NL*
troubled
himself
about
that
?
What
becomes
of
the
handful
of
leaves
from
*NL*
the
young
tree
which
is
sawed
off
at
the
root
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
always
the
same
story
.
These
poor
living
beings
,
these
creatures
*NL*
of
God
,
henceforth
without
support
,
without
guide
,
without
refuge
,
*NL*
wandered
away
at
random
,
--
who
even
knows
?
--
each
in
his
own
direction
*NL*
perhaps
,
and
little
by
little
buried
themselves
in
that
cold
mist
which
*NL*
engulfs
solitary
destinies
;
gloomy
shades
,
into
which
disappear
in
*NL*
succession
so
many
unlucky
heads
,
in
the
sombre
march
of
the
human
race
.
*NL*
They
quitted
the
country
.
The
clock-tower
of
what
had
been
their
village
*NL*
forgot
them
;
the
boundary
line
of
what
had
been
their
field
forgot
them
;
*NL*
after
a
few
years
'
residence
in
the
galleys
,
Jean
Valjean
himself
forgot
*NL*
them
.
In
that
heart
,
where
there
had
been
a
wound
,
there
was
a
scar
.
*NL*
That
is
all
.
Only
once
,
during
all
the
time
which
he
spent
at
Toulon
,
*NL*
did
he
hear
his
sister
mentioned
.
This
happened
,
I
think
,
towards
*NL*
the
end
of
the
fourth
year
of
his
captivity
.
I
know
not
through
what
*NL*
channels
the
news
reached
him
.
Some
one
who
had
known
them
in
their
*NL*
own
country
had
seen
his
sister
.
She
was
in
Paris
.
She
lived
in
a
poor
*NL*
street
Rear
Saint-Sulpice
,
in
the
Rue
du
Gindre
.
She
had
with
her
only
*NL*
one
child
,
a
little
boy
,
the
youngest
.
Where
were
the
other
six
?
Perhaps
*NL*
she
did
not
know
herself
.
Every
morning
she
went
to
a
printing
office
,
*NL*
No.
3
Rue
du
Sabot
,
where
she
was
a
folder
and
stitcher
.
She
was
obliged
*NL*
to
be
there
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
--
long
before
daylight
in
*NL*
winter
.
In
the
same
building
with
the
printing
office
there
was
a
*NL*
school
,
and
to
this
school
she
took
her
little
boy
,
who
was
seven
years
*NL*
old
.
But
as
she
entered
the
printing
office
at
six
,
and
the
school
only
*NL*
opened
at
seven
,
the
child
had
to
wait
in
the
courtyard
,
for
the
school
*NL*
to
open
,
for
an
hour
--
one
hour
of
a
winter
night
in
the
open
air
!
They
*NL*
would
not
allow
the
child
to
come
into
the
printing
office
,
because
he
*NL*
was
in
the
way
,
they
said
.
When
the
workmen
passed
in
the
morning
,
they
*NL*
beheld
this
poor
little
being
seated
on
the
pavement
,
overcome
with
*NL*
drowsiness
,
and
often
fast
asleep
in
the
shadow
,
crouched
down
and
*NL*
doubled
up
over
his
basket
.
When
it
rained
,
an
old
woman
,
the
portress
,
*NL*
took
pity
on
him
;
she
took
him
into
her
den
,
where
there
was
a
pallet
,
a
*NL*
spinning-wheel
,
and
two
wooden
chairs
,
and
the
little
one
slumbered
in
a
*NL*
corner
,
pressing
himself
close
to
the
cat
that
he
might
suffer
less
from
*NL*
cold
.
At
seven
o'clock
the
school
opened
,
and
he
entered
.
That
is
what
*NL*
was
told
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
to
him
about
it
for
one
day
;
it
was
a
moment
,
a
flash
,
*NL*
as
though
a
window
had
suddenly
been
opened
upon
the
destiny
of
those
*NL*
things
whom
he
had
loved
;
then
all
closed
again
.
He
heard
nothing
more
*NL*
forever
.
Nothing
from
them
ever
reached
him
again
;
he
never
beheld
*NL*
them
;
he
never
met
them
again
;
and
in
the
continuation
of
this
mournful
*NL*
history
they
will
not
be
met
with
any
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
this
fourth
year
Jean
Valjean
's
turn
to
escape
*NL*
arrived
.
His
comrades
assisted
him
,
as
is
the
custom
in
that
sad
place
.
*NL*
He
escaped
.
He
wandered
for
two
days
in
the
fields
at
liberty
,
if
being
*NL*
at
liberty
is
to
be
hunted
,
to
turn
the
head
every
instant
,
to
quake
at
*NL*
the
slightest
noise
,
to
be
afraid
of
everything
,
--
of
a
smoking
roof
,
*NL*
of
a
passing
man
,
of
a
barking
dog
,
of
a
galloping
horse
,
of
a
striking
*NL*
clock
,
of
the
day
because
one
can
see
,
of
the
night
because
one
can
not
*NL*
see
,
of
the
highway
,
of
the
path
,
of
a
bush
,
of
sleep
.
On
the
evening
*NL*
of
the
second
day
he
was
captured
.
He
had
neither
eaten
nor
slept
for
*NL*
thirty-six
hours
.
The
maritime
tribunal
condemned
him
,
for
this
crime
,
*NL*
to
a
prolongation
of
his
term
for
three
years
,
which
made
eight
years
.
*NL*
In
the
sixth
year
his
turn
to
escape
occurred
again
;
he
availed
himself
*NL*
of
it
,
but
could
not
accomplish
his
flight
fully
.
He
was
missing
at
*NL*
roll-call
.
The
cannon
were
fired
,
and
at
night
the
patrol
found
him
*NL*
hidden
under
the
keel
of
a
vessel
in
process
of
construction
;
he
*NL*
resisted
the
galley
guards
who
seized
him
.
Escape
and
rebellion
.
This
*NL*
case
,
provided
for
by
a
special
code
,
was
punished
by
an
addition
of
*NL*
five
years
,
two
of
them
in
the
double
chain
.
Thirteen
years
.
In
the
*NL*
tenth
year
his
turn
came
round
again
;
he
again
profited
by
it
;
he
*NL*
succeeded
no
better
.
Three
years
for
this
fresh
attempt
.
Sixteen
years
.
*NL*
Finally
,
I
think
it
was
during
his
thirteenth
year
,
he
made
a
last
*NL*
attempt
,
and
only
succeeded
in
getting
retaken
at
the
end
of
four
*NL*
hours
of
absence
.
Three
years
for
those
four
hours
.
Nineteen
years
.
In
*NL*
October
,
1815
,
he
was
released
;
he
had
entered
there
in
1796
,
for
having
*NL*
broken
a
pane
of
glass
and
taken
a
loaf
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Room
for
a
brief
parenthesis
.
This
is
the
second
time
,
during
his
*NL*
studies
on
the
penal
question
and
damnation
by
law
,
that
the
author
of
*NL*
this
book
has
come
across
the
theft
of
a
loaf
of
bread
as
the
point
of
*NL*
departure
for
the
disaster
of
a
destiny
.
Claude
Gueux
had
stolen
a
loaf
;
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
stolen
a
loaf
.
English
statistics
prove
the
fact
that
*NL*
four
thefts
out
of
five
in
London
have
hunger
for
their
immediate
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
entered
the
galleys
sobbing
and
shuddering
;
he
emerged
*NL*
impassive
.
He
had
entered
in
despair
;
he
emerged
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
taken
place
in
that
soul
?

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
INTERIOR
OF
DESPAIR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
try
to
say
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
necessary
that
society
should
look
at
these
things
,
because
it
is
*NL*
itself
which
creates
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
an
ignorant
man
,
but
he
was
not
a
fool
.
The
*NL*
light
of
nature
was
ignited
in
him
.
Unhappiness
,
which
also
possesses
a
*NL*
clearness
of
vision
of
its
own
,
augmented
the
small
amount
of
daylight
*NL*
which
existed
in
this
mind
.
Beneath
the
cudgel
,
beneath
the
chain
,
in
*NL*
the
cell
,
in
hardship
,
beneath
the
burning
sun
of
the
galleys
,
upon
the
*NL*
plank
bed
of
the
convict
,
he
withdrew
into
his
own
consciousness
and
*NL*
meditated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
constituted
himself
the
tribunal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
by
putting
himself
on
trial
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
not
an
innocent
man
unjustly
*NL*
punished
.
He
admitted
that
he
had
committed
an
extreme
and
blameworthy
*NL*
act
;
that
that
loaf
of
bread
would
probably
not
have
been
refused
to
*NL*
him
had
he
asked
for
it
;
that
,
in
any
case
,
it
would
have
been
better
to
*NL*
wait
until
he
could
get
it
through
compassion
or
through
work
;
that
*NL*
it
is
not
an
unanswerable
argument
to
say
,
``
Can
one
wait
when
one
is
*NL*
hungry
?
''
That
,
in
the
first
place
,
it
is
very
rare
for
any
one
to
die
of
*NL*
hunger
,
literally
;
and
next
,
that
,
fortunately
or
unfortunately
,
man
*NL*
is
so
constituted
that
he
can
suffer
long
and
much
,
both
morally
and
*NL*
physically
,
without
dying
;
that
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
have
*NL*
patience
;
that
that
would
even
have
been
better
for
those
poor
little
*NL*
children
;
that
it
had
been
an
act
of
madness
for
him
,
a
miserable
,
*NL*
unfortunate
wretch
,
to
take
society
at
large
violently
by
the
collar
,
*NL*
and
to
imagine
that
one
can
escape
from
misery
through
theft
;
that
that
*NL*
is
in
any
case
a
poor
door
through
which
to
escape
from
misery
through
*NL*
which
infamy
enters
;
in
short
,
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
asked
himself
--
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
he
had
been
the
only
one
in
fault
in
his
fatal
history
.
Whether
*NL*
it
was
not
a
serious
thing
,
that
he
,
a
laborer
,
out
of
work
,
that
he
,
an
*NL*
industrious
man
,
should
have
lacked
bread
.
And
whether
,
the
fault
once
*NL*
committed
and
confessed
,
the
chastisement
had
not
been
ferocious
and
*NL*
disproportioned
.
Whether
there
had
not
been
more
abuse
on
the
part
of
*NL*
the
law
,
in
respect
to
the
penalty
,
than
there
had
been
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
culprit
in
respect
to
his
fault
.
Whether
there
had
not
been
an
*NL*
excess
of
weights
in
one
balance
of
the
scale
,
in
the
one
which
contains
*NL*
expiation
.
Whether
the
over-weight
of
the
penalty
was
not
equivalent
*NL*
to
the
annihilation
of
the
crime
,
and
did
not
result
in
reversing
the
*NL*
situation
,
of
replacing
the
fault
of
the
delinquent
by
the
fault
of
the
*NL*
repression
,
of
converting
the
guilty
man
into
the
victim
,
and
the
debtor
*NL*
into
the
creditor
,
and
of
ranging
the
law
definitely
on
the
side
of
the
*NL*
man
who
had
violated
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
this
penalty
,
complicated
by
successive
aggravations
for
*NL*
attempts
at
escape
,
had
not
ended
in
becoming
a
sort
of
outrage
*NL*
perpetrated
by
the
stronger
upon
the
feebler
,
a
crime
of
society
against
*NL*
the
individual
,
a
crime
which
was
being
committed
afresh
every
day
,
a
*NL*
crime
which
had
lasted
nineteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
himself
whether
human
society
could
have
the
right
to
force
its
*NL*
members
to
suffer
equally
in
one
case
for
its
own
unreasonable
lack
*NL*
of
foresight
,
and
in
the
other
case
for
its
pitiless
foresight
;
and
to
*NL*
seize
a
poor
man
forever
between
a
defect
and
an
excess
,
a
default
of
*NL*
work
and
an
excess
of
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
it
was
not
outrageous
for
society
to
treat
thus
precisely
those
*NL*
of
its
members
who
were
the
least
well
endowed
in
the
division
of
goods
*NL*
made
by
chance
,
and
consequently
the
most
deserving
of
consideration
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
questions
put
and
answered
,
he
judged
society
and
condemned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
condemned
it
to
his
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
it
responsible
for
the
fate
which
he
was
suffering
,
and
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
that
it
might
be
that
one
day
he
should
not
hesitate
to
call
*NL*
it
to
account
.
He
declared
to
himself
that
there
was
no
equilibrium
*NL*
between
the
harm
which
he
had
caused
and
the
harm
which
was
being
done
*NL*
to
him
;
he
finally
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
his
punishment
was
*NL*
not
,
in
truth
,
unjust
,
but
that
it
most
assuredly
was
iniquitous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anger
may
be
both
foolish
and
absurd
;
one
can
be
irritated
wrongfully
;
*NL*
one
is
exasperated
only
when
there
is
some
show
of
right
on
one
's
side
*NL*
at
bottom
.
Jean
Valjean
felt
himself
exasperated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
besides
,
human
society
had
done
him
nothing
but
harm
;
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
anything
of
it
save
that
angry
face
which
it
calls
Justice
,
and
*NL*
which
it
shows
to
those
whom
it
strikes
.
Men
had
only
touched
him
to
*NL*
bruise
him
.
Every
contact
with
them
had
been
a
blow
.
Never
,
since
*NL*
his
infancy
,
since
the
days
of
his
mother
,
of
his
sister
,
had
he
ever
*NL*
encountered
a
friendly
word
and
a
kindly
glance
.
From
suffering
to
*NL*
suffering
,
he
had
gradually
arrived
at
the
conviction
that
life
is
a
*NL*
war
;
and
that
in
this
war
he
was
the
conquered
.
He
had
no
other
weapon
*NL*
than
his
hate
.
He
resolved
to
whet
it
in
the
galleys
and
to
bear
it
away
*NL*
with
him
when
he
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
at
Toulon
a
school
for
the
convicts
,
kept
by
the
Ignorantin
*NL*
friars
,
where
the
most
necessary
branches
were
taught
to
those
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
men
who
had
a
mind
for
them
.
He
was
of
the
number
who
had
*NL*
a
mind
.
He
went
to
school
at
the
age
of
forty
,
and
learned
to
read
,
*NL*
to
write
,
to
cipher
.
He
felt
that
to
fortify
his
intelligence
was
to
*NL*
fortify
his
hate
.
In
certain
cases
,
education
and
enlightenment
can
*NL*
serve
to
eke
out
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
a
sad
thing
to
say
;
after
having
judged
society
,
which
had
*NL*
caused
his
unhappiness
,
he
judged
Providence
,
which
had
made
society
,
*NL*
and
he
condemned
it
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
during
nineteen
years
of
torture
and
slavery
,
this
soul
mounted
and
*NL*
at
the
same
time
fell
.
Light
entered
it
on
one
side
,
and
darkness
on
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
not
,
as
we
have
seen
,
an
evil
nature
.
He
was
still
good
*NL*
when
he
arrived
at
the
galleys
.
He
there
condemned
society
,
and
felt
*NL*
that
he
was
becoming
wicked
;
he
there
condemned
Providence
,
and
was
*NL*
conscious
that
he
was
becoming
impious
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
difficult
not
to
indulge
in
meditation
at
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Does
human
nature
thus
change
utterly
and
from
top
to
bottom
?
Can
the
*NL*
man
created
good
by
God
be
rendered
wicked
by
man
?
Can
the
soul
be
*NL*
completely
made
over
by
fate
,
and
become
evil
,
fate
being
evil
?
Can
*NL*
the
heart
become
misshapen
and
contract
incurable
deformities
and
*NL*
infirmities
under
the
oppression
of
a
disproportionate
unhappiness
,
*NL*
as
the
vertebral
column
beneath
too
low
a
vault
?
Is
there
not
in
every
*NL*
human
soul
,
was
there
not
in
the
soul
of
Jean
Valjean
in
particular
,
a
*NL*
first
spark
,
a
divine
element
,
incorruptible
in
this
world
,
immortal
in
*NL*
the
other
,
which
good
can
develop
,
fan
,
ignite
,
and
make
to
glow
with
*NL*
splendor
,
and
which
evil
can
never
wholly
extinguish
?
*NL*
*NL*
Grave
and
obscure
questions
,
to
the
last
of
which
every
physiologist
*NL*
would
probably
have
responded
no
,
and
that
without
hesitation
,
had
*NL*
he
beheld
at
Toulon
,
during
the
hours
of
repose
,
which
were
for
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
hours
of
revery
,
this
gloomy
galley-slave
,
seated
with
folded
*NL*
arms
upon
the
bar
of
some
capstan
,
with
the
end
of
his
chain
thrust
into
*NL*
his
pocket
to
prevent
its
dragging
,
serious
,
silent
,
and
thoughtful
,
*NL*
a
pariah
of
the
laws
which
regarded
the
man
with
wrath
,
condemned
by
*NL*
civilization
,
and
regarding
heaven
with
severity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
--
and
we
make
no
attempt
to
dissimulate
the
fact
,
--
the
*NL*
observing
physiologist
would
have
beheld
an
irremediable
misery
;
he
*NL*
would
,
perchance
,
have
pitied
this
sick
man
,
of
the
law
's
making
;
but
*NL*
he
would
not
have
even
essayed
any
treatment
;
he
would
have
turned
aside
*NL*
his
gaze
from
the
caverns
of
which
he
would
have
caught
a
glimpse
within
*NL*
this
soul
,
and
,
like
Dante
at
the
portals
of
hell
,
he
would
have
effaced
*NL*
from
this
existence
the
word
which
the
finger
of
God
has
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
inscribed
upon
the
brow
of
every
man
,
--
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
this
state
of
his
soul
,
which
we
have
attempted
to
analyze
,
as
*NL*
perfectly
clear
to
Jean
Valjean
as
we
have
tried
to
render
it
for
*NL*
those
who
read
us
?
Did
Jean
Valjean
distinctly
perceive
,
after
their
*NL*
formation
,
and
had
he
seen
distinctly
during
the
process
of
their
*NL*
formation
,
all
the
elements
of
which
his
moral
misery
was
composed
?
Had
*NL*
this
rough
and
unlettered
man
gathered
a
perfectly
clear
perception
of
*NL*
the
succession
of
ideas
through
which
he
had
,
by
degrees
,
mounted
and
*NL*
descended
to
the
lugubrious
aspects
which
had
,
for
so
many
years
,
formed
*NL*
the
inner
horizon
of
his
spirit
?
Was
he
conscious
of
all
that
passed
*NL*
within
him
,
and
of
all
that
was
working
there
?
That
is
something
*NL*
which
we
do
not
presume
to
state
;
it
is
something
which
we
do
not
even
*NL*
believe
.
There
was
too
much
ignorance
in
Jean
Valjean
,
even
after
his
*NL*
misfortune
,
to
prevent
much
vagueness
from
still
lingering
there
.
At
*NL*
times
he
did
not
rightly
know
himself
what
he
felt
.
Jean
Valjean
was
in
*NL*
the
shadows
;
he
suffered
in
the
shadows
;
he
hated
in
the
shadows
;
one
*NL*
might
have
said
that
he
hated
in
advance
of
himself
.
He
dwelt
habitually
*NL*
in
this
shadow
,
feeling
his
way
like
a
blind
man
and
a
dreamer
.
Only
,
at
*NL*
intervals
,
there
suddenly
came
to
him
,
from
without
and
from
within
,
an
*NL*
access
of
wrath
,
a
surcharge
of
suffering
,
a
livid
and
rapid
flash
which
*NL*
illuminated
his
whole
soul
,
and
caused
to
appear
abruptly
all
around
*NL*
him
,
in
front
,
behind
,
amid
the
gleams
of
a
frightful
light
,
the
hideous
*NL*
precipices
and
the
sombre
perspective
of
his
destiny
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flash
passed
,
the
night
closed
in
again
;
and
where
was
he
?
He
no
*NL*
longer
knew
.
The
peculiarity
of
pains
of
this
nature
,
in
which
*NL*
that
which
is
pitiless
--
that
is
to
say
,
that
which
is
*NL*
brutalizing
--
predominates
,
is
to
transform
a
man
,
little
by
little
,
by
*NL*
a
sort
of
stupid
transfiguration
,
into
a
wild
beast
;
sometimes
into
a
*NL*
ferocious
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
successive
and
obstinate
attempts
at
escape
would
alone
*NL*
suffice
to
prove
this
strange
working
of
the
law
upon
the
human
soul
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
would
have
renewed
these
attempts
,
utterly
useless
and
*NL*
foolish
as
they
were
,
as
often
as
the
opportunity
had
presented
itself
,
*NL*
without
reflecting
for
an
instant
on
the
result
,
nor
on
the
experiences
*NL*
which
he
had
already
gone
through
.
He
escaped
impetuously
,
like
the
wolf
*NL*
who
finds
his
cage
open
.
Instinct
said
to
him
,
``
Flee
!
''
Reason
would
have
*NL*
said
,
``
Remain
!
''
But
in
the
presence
of
so
violent
a
temptation
,
reason
*NL*
vanished
;
nothing
remained
but
instinct
.
The
beast
alone
acted
.
When
*NL*
he
was
recaptured
,
the
fresh
severities
inflicted
on
him
only
served
to
*NL*
render
him
still
more
wild
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
detail
,
which
we
must
not
omit
,
is
that
he
possessed
a
physical
*NL*
strength
which
was
not
approached
by
a
single
one
of
the
denizens
of
the
*NL*
galleys
.
At
work
,
at
paying
out
a
cable
or
winding
up
a
capstan
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
worth
four
men
.
He
sometimes
lifted
and
sustained
enormous
*NL*
weights
on
his
back
;
and
when
the
occasion
demanded
it
,
he
replaced
that
*NL*
implement
which
is
called
a
jack-screw
,
and
was
formerly
called
orgueil
*NL*
-LSB-
pride
-RSB-
,
whence
,
we
may
remark
in
passing
,
is
derived
the
name
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Montorgueil
,
near
the
Halles
-LSB-
Fishmarket
-RSB-
in
Paris
.
His
comrades
had
*NL*
nicknamed
him
Jean
the
Jack-screw
.
Once
,
when
they
were
repairing
the
*NL*
balcony
of
the
town-hall
at
Toulon
,
one
of
those
admirable
caryatids
of
*NL*
Puget
,
which
support
the
balcony
,
became
loosened
,
and
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
falling
.
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
present
,
supported
the
caryatid
with
*NL*
his
shoulder
,
and
gave
the
workmen
time
to
arrive
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
suppleness
even
exceeded
his
strength
.
Certain
convicts
who
were
*NL*
forever
dreaming
of
escape
,
ended
by
making
a
veritable
science
of
force
*NL*
and
skill
combined
.
It
is
the
science
of
muscles
.
An
entire
system
of
*NL*
mysterious
statics
is
daily
practised
by
prisoners
,
men
who
are
forever
*NL*
envious
of
the
flies
and
birds
.
To
climb
a
vertical
surface
,
and
to
find
*NL*
points
of
support
where
hardly
a
projection
was
visible
,
was
play
to
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
An
angle
of
the
wall
being
given
,
with
the
tension
of
his
*NL*
back
and
legs
,
with
his
elbows
and
his
heels
fitted
into
the
unevenness
*NL*
of
the
stone
,
he
raised
himself
as
if
by
magic
to
the
third
story
.
He
*NL*
sometimes
mounted
thus
even
to
the
roof
of
the
galley
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
but
little
.
He
laughed
not
at
all
.
An
excessive
emotion
was
*NL*
required
to
wring
from
him
,
once
or
twice
a
year
,
that
lugubrious
laugh
*NL*
of
the
convict
,
which
is
like
the
echo
of
the
laugh
of
a
demon
.
To
all
*NL*
appearance
,
he
seemed
to
be
occupied
in
the
constant
contemplation
of
*NL*
something
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
absorbed
,
in
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
Athwart
the
unhealthy
perceptions
of
an
incomplete
nature
and
a
crushed
*NL*
intelligence
,
he
was
confusedly
conscious
that
some
monstrous
thing
was
*NL*
resting
on
him
.
In
that
obscure
and
wan
shadow
within
which
he
crawled
,
*NL*
each
time
that
he
turned
his
neck
and
essayed
to
raise
his
glance
,
*NL*
he
perceived
with
terror
,
mingled
with
rage
,
a
sort
of
frightful
*NL*
accumulation
of
things
,
collecting
and
mounting
above
him
,
beyond
the
*NL*
range
of
his
vision
,
--
laws
,
prejudices
,
men
,
and
deeds
,
--
whose
outlines
*NL*
escaped
him
,
whose
mass
terrified
him
,
and
which
was
nothing
else
than
*NL*
that
prodigious
pyramid
which
we
call
civilization
.
He
distinguished
,
*NL*
here
and
there
in
that
swarming
and
formless
mass
,
now
near
him
,
now
*NL*
afar
off
and
on
inaccessible
table-lands
,
some
group
,
some
detail
,
*NL*
vividly
illuminated
;
here
the
galley-sergeant
and
his
cudgel
;
there
the
*NL*
gendarme
and
his
sword
;
yonder
the
mitred
archbishop
;
away
at
the
top
,
*NL*
like
a
sort
of
sun
,
the
Emperor
,
crowned
and
dazzling
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
these
distant
splendors
,
far
from
dissipating
his
night
,
rendered
*NL*
it
more
funereal
and
more
black
.
All
this
--
laws
,
prejudices
,
deeds
,
men
,
*NL*
things
--
went
and
came
above
him
,
over
his
head
,
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
complicated
and
mysterious
movement
which
God
imparts
to
civilization
,
*NL*
walking
over
him
and
crushing
him
with
I
know
not
what
peacefulness
*NL*
in
its
cruelty
and
inexorability
in
its
indifference
.
Souls
which
have
*NL*
fallen
to
the
bottom
of
all
possible
misfortune
,
unhappy
men
lost
in
the
*NL*
lowest
of
those
limbos
at
which
no
one
any
longer
looks
,
the
reproved
of
*NL*
the
law
,
feel
the
whole
weight
of
this
human
society
,
so
formidable
for
*NL*
him
who
is
without
,
so
frightful
for
him
who
is
beneath
,
resting
upon
*NL*
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
situation
Jean
Valjean
meditated
;
and
what
could
be
the
nature
*NL*
of
his
meditation
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
grain
of
millet
beneath
the
millstone
had
thoughts
,
it
would
,
*NL*
doubtless
,
think
that
same
thing
which
Jean
Valjean
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
things
,
realities
full
of
spectres
,
phantasmagories
full
of
*NL*
realities
,
had
eventually
created
for
him
a
sort
of
interior
state
which
*NL*
is
almost
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
,
amid
his
convict
toil
,
he
paused
.
He
fell
to
thinking
.
His
*NL*
reason
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
riper
and
more
troubled
than
of
yore
,
*NL*
rose
in
revolt
.
Everything
which
had
happened
to
him
seemed
to
him
*NL*
absurd
;
everything
that
surrounded
him
seemed
to
him
impossible
.
He
said
*NL*
to
himself
,
``
It
is
a
dream
.
''
He
gazed
at
the
galley-sergeant
standing
a
*NL*
few
paces
from
him
;
the
galley-sergeant
seemed
a
phantom
to
him
.
All
of
*NL*
a
sudden
the
phantom
dealt
him
a
blow
with
his
cudgel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Visible
nature
hardly
existed
for
him
.
It
would
almost
be
true
to
say
*NL*
that
there
existed
for
Jean
Valjean
neither
sun
,
nor
fine
summer
days
,
*NL*
nor
radiant
sky
,
nor
fresh
April
dawns
.
I
know
not
what
vent-hole
*NL*
daylight
habitually
illumined
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
sum
up
,
in
conclusion
,
that
which
can
be
summed
up
and
translated
*NL*
into
positive
results
in
all
that
we
have
just
pointed
out
,
we
will
*NL*
confine
ourselves
to
the
statement
that
,
in
the
course
of
nineteen
*NL*
years
,
Jean
Valjean
,
the
inoffensive
tree-pruner
of
Faverolles
,
the
*NL*
formidable
convict
of
Toulon
,
had
become
capable
,
thanks
to
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
the
galleys
had
moulded
him
,
of
two
sorts
of
evil
action
:
*NL*
firstly
,
of
evil
action
which
was
rapid
,
unpremeditated
,
dashing
,
*NL*
entirely
instinctive
,
in
the
nature
of
reprisals
for
the
evil
which
*NL*
he
had
undergone
;
secondly
,
of
evil
action
which
was
serious
,
grave
,
*NL*
consciously
argued
out
and
premeditated
,
with
the
false
ideas
which
*NL*
such
a
misfortune
can
furnish
.
His
deliberate
deeds
passed
through
*NL*
three
successive
phases
,
which
natures
of
a
certain
stamp
can
alone
*NL*
traverse
,
--
reasoning
,
will
,
perseverance
.
He
had
for
moving
causes
his
*NL*
habitual
wrath
,
bitterness
of
soul
,
a
profound
sense
of
indignities
*NL*
suffered
,
the
reaction
even
against
the
good
,
the
innocent
,
and
the
*NL*
just
,
if
there
are
any
such
.
The
point
of
departure
,
like
the
point
*NL*
of
arrival
,
for
all
his
thoughts
,
was
hatred
of
human
law
;
that
hatred
*NL*
which
,
if
it
be
not
arrested
in
its
development
by
some
providential
*NL*
incident
,
becomes
,
within
a
given
time
,
the
hatred
of
society
,
then
*NL*
the
hatred
of
the
human
race
,
then
the
hatred
of
creation
,
and
which
*NL*
manifests
itself
by
a
vague
,
incessant
,
and
brutal
desire
to
do
harm
to
*NL*
some
living
being
,
no
matter
whom
.
It
will
be
perceived
that
it
was
*NL*
not
without
reason
that
Jean
Valjean
's
passport
described
him
as
a
very
*NL*
dangerous
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
year
to
year
this
soul
had
dried
away
slowly
,
but
with
fatal
*NL*
sureness
.
When
the
heart
is
dry
,
the
eye
is
dry
.
On
his
departure
from
*NL*
the
galleys
it
had
been
nineteen
years
since
he
had
shed
a
tear
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
BILLOWS
AND
SHADOWS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
overboard
!
*NL*
*NL*
What
matters
it
?
The
vessel
does
not
halt
.
The
wind
blows
.
That
sombre
*NL*
ship
has
a
path
which
it
is
forced
to
pursue
.
It
passes
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
disappears
,
then
reappears
;
he
plunges
,
he
rises
again
to
the
*NL*
surface
;
he
calls
,
he
stretches
out
his
arms
;
he
is
not
heard
.
The
*NL*
vessel
,
trembling
under
the
hurricane
,
is
wholly
absorbed
in
its
own
*NL*
workings
;
the
passengers
and
sailors
do
not
even
see
the
drowning
man
;
*NL*
his
miserable
head
is
but
a
speck
amid
the
immensity
of
the
waves
.
He
*NL*
gives
vent
to
desperate
cries
from
out
of
the
depths
.
What
a
spectre
is
*NL*
that
retreating
sail
!
He
gazes
and
gazes
at
it
frantically
.
It
retreats
,
*NL*
it
grows
dim
,
it
diminishes
in
size
.
He
was
there
but
just
now
,
he
was
*NL*
one
of
the
crew
,
he
went
and
came
along
the
deck
with
the
rest
,
he
had
*NL*
his
part
of
breath
and
of
sunlight
,
he
was
a
living
man
.
Now
,
what
has
*NL*
taken
place
?
He
has
slipped
,
he
has
fallen
;
all
is
at
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
in
the
tremendous
sea
.
Under
foot
he
has
nothing
but
what
flees
*NL*
and
crumbles
.
The
billows
,
torn
and
lashed
by
the
wind
,
encompass
him
*NL*
hideously
;
the
tossings
of
the
abyss
bear
him
away
;
all
the
tongues
of
*NL*
water
dash
over
his
head
;
a
populace
of
waves
spits
upon
him
;
confused
*NL*
openings
half
devour
him
;
every
time
that
he
sinks
,
he
catches
glimpses
*NL*
of
precipices
filled
with
night
;
frightful
and
unknown
vegetations
seize
*NL*
him
,
knot
about
his
feet
,
draw
him
to
them
;
he
is
conscious
that
he
is
*NL*
becoming
an
abyss
,
that
he
forms
part
of
the
foam
;
the
waves
toss
him
*NL*
from
one
to
another
;
he
drinks
in
the
bitterness
;
the
cowardly
ocean
*NL*
attacks
him
furiously
,
to
drown
him
;
the
enormity
plays
with
his
agony
.
*NL*
It
seems
as
though
all
that
water
were
hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
struggles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
tries
to
defend
himself
;
he
tries
to
sustain
himself
;
he
makes
*NL*
an
effort
;
he
swims
.
He
,
his
petty
strength
all
exhausted
instantly
,
*NL*
combats
the
inexhaustible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
,
then
,
is
the
ship
?
Yonder
.
Barely
visible
in
the
pale
shadows
of
*NL*
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
blows
in
gusts
;
all
the
foam
overwhelms
him
.
He
raises
his
eyes
*NL*
and
beholds
only
the
lividness
of
the
clouds
.
He
witnesses
,
amid
his
*NL*
death-pangs
,
the
immense
madness
of
the
sea
.
He
is
tortured
by
this
*NL*
madness
;
he
hears
noises
strange
to
man
,
which
seem
to
come
from
beyond
*NL*
the
limits
of
the
earth
,
and
from
one
knows
not
what
frightful
region
*NL*
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
birds
in
the
clouds
,
just
as
there
are
angels
above
human
*NL*
distresses
;
but
what
can
they
do
for
him
?
They
sing
and
fly
and
float
,
*NL*
and
he
,
he
rattles
in
the
death
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
feels
himself
buried
in
those
two
infinities
,
the
ocean
and
the
sky
,
*NL*
at
one
and
the
same
time
:
the
one
is
a
tomb
;
the
other
is
a
shroud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
descends
;
he
has
been
swimming
for
hours
;
his
strength
is
*NL*
exhausted
;
that
ship
,
that
distant
thing
in
which
there
were
men
,
has
*NL*
vanished
;
he
is
alone
in
the
formidable
twilight
gulf
;
he
sinks
,
he
*NL*
stiffens
himself
,
he
twists
himself
;
he
feels
under
him
the
monstrous
*NL*
billows
of
the
invisible
;
he
shouts
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
no
more
men
.
Where
is
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
shouts
.
Help
!
Help
!
He
still
shouts
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
on
the
horizon
;
nothing
in
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
implores
the
expanse
,
the
waves
,
the
seaweed
,
the
reef
;
they
are
*NL*
deaf
.
He
beseeches
the
tempest
;
the
imperturbable
tempest
obeys
only
the
*NL*
infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Around
him
darkness
,
fog
,
solitude
,
the
stormy
and
nonsentient
tumult
,
*NL*
the
undefined
curling
of
those
wild
waters
.
In
him
horror
and
fatigue
.
*NL*
Beneath
him
the
depths
.
Not
a
point
of
support
.
He
thinks
of
the
gloomy
*NL*
adventures
of
the
corpse
in
the
limitless
shadow
.
The
bottomless
cold
*NL*
paralyzes
him
.
His
hands
contract
convulsively
;
they
close
,
and
grasp
*NL*
nothingness
.
Winds
,
clouds
,
whirlwinds
,
gusts
,
useless
stars
!
What
is
*NL*
to
be
done
?
The
desperate
man
gives
up
;
he
is
weary
,
he
chooses
the
*NL*
alternative
of
death
;
he
resists
not
;
he
lets
himself
go
;
he
abandons
*NL*
his
grip
;
and
then
he
tosses
forevermore
in
the
lugubrious
dreary
depths
*NL*
of
engulfment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
implacable
march
of
human
societies
!
Oh
,
losses
of
men
and
of
*NL*
souls
on
the
way
!
Ocean
into
which
falls
all
that
the
law
lets
slip
!
*NL*
Disastrous
absence
of
help
!
Oh
,
moral
death
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
sea
is
the
inexorable
social
night
into
which
the
penal
laws
fling
*NL*
their
condemned
.
The
sea
is
the
immensity
of
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soul
,
going
down
stream
in
this
gulf
,
may
become
a
corpse
.
Who

CHAPTER
IX
--
NEW
TROUBLES
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
hour
came
for
him
to
take
his
departure
from
the
galleys
,
when
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
heard
in
his
ear
the
strange
words
,
Thou
art
free
!
the
*NL*
moment
seemed
improbable
and
unprecedented
;
a
ray
of
vivid
light
,
a
ray
*NL*
of
the
true
light
of
the
living
,
suddenly
penetrated
within
him
.
But
it
*NL*
was
not
long
before
this
ray
paled
.
Jean
Valjean
had
been
dazzled
by
*NL*
the
idea
of
liberty
.
He
had
believed
in
a
new
life
.
He
very
speedily
*NL*
perceived
what
sort
of
liberty
it
is
to
which
a
yellow
passport
is
*NL*
provided
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
encompassed
with
much
bitterness
.
He
had
calculated
that
*NL*
his
earnings
,
during
his
sojourn
in
the
galleys
,
ought
to
amount
to
*NL*
a
hundred
and
seventy-one
francs
.
It
is
but
just
to
add
that
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
to
include
in
his
calculations
the
forced
repose
of
Sundays
*NL*
and
festival
days
during
nineteen
years
,
which
entailed
a
diminution
*NL*
of
about
eighty
francs
.
At
all
events
,
his
hoard
had
been
reduced
by
*NL*
various
local
levies
to
the
sum
of
one
hundred
and
nine
francs
fifteen
*NL*
sous
,
which
had
been
counted
out
to
him
on
his
departure
.
He
had
*NL*
understood
nothing
of
this
,
and
had
thought
himself
wronged
.
Let
us
say
*NL*
the
word
--
robbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
following
his
liberation
,
he
saw
,
at
Grasse
,
in
front
of
*NL*
an
orange-flower
distillery
,
some
men
engaged
in
unloading
bales
.
He
*NL*
offered
his
services
.
Business
was
pressing
;
they
were
accepted
.
He
set
*NL*
to
work
.
He
was
intelligent
,
robust
,
adroit
;
he
did
his
best
;
the
master
*NL*
seemed
pleased
.
While
he
was
at
work
,
a
gendarme
passed
,
observed
*NL*
him
,
and
demanded
his
papers
.
It
was
necessary
to
show
him
the
yellow
*NL*
passport
.
That
done
,
Jean
Valjean
resumed
his
labor
.
A
little
while
*NL*
before
he
had
questioned
one
of
the
workmen
as
to
the
amount
which
they
*NL*
earned
each
day
at
this
occupation
;
he
had
been
told
thirty
sous
.
When
*NL*
evening
arrived
,
as
he
was
forced
to
set
out
again
on
the
following
day
,
*NL*
he
presented
himself
to
the
owner
of
the
distillery
and
requested
to
be
*NL*
paid
.
The
owner
did
not
utter
a
word
,
but
handed
him
twenty-five
sous
.
He
*NL*
objected
.
He
was
told
,
``
That
is
enough
for
thee
.
''
He
persisted
.
The
*NL*
master
looked
him
straight
between
the
eyes
,
and
said
to
him
``
Beware
of
*NL*
the
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
again
,
he
considered
that
he
had
been
robbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Society
,
the
State
,
by
diminishing
his
hoard
,
had
robbed
him
wholesale
.
*NL*
Now
it
was
the
individual
who
was
robbing
him
at
retail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Liberation
is
not
deliverance
.
One
gets
free
from
the
galleys
,
but
not
*NL*
from
the
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
what
happened
to
him
at
Grasse
.
We
have
seen
in
what
manner
he
*NL*
was
received
at

CHAPTER
X
--
THE
MAN
AROUSED
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Cathedral
clock
struck
two
in
the
morning
,
Jean
Valjean
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
woke
him
was
that
his
bed
was
too
good
.
It
was
nearly
twenty
years
*NL*
since
he
had
slept
in
a
bed
,
and
,
although
he
had
not
undressed
,
the
*NL*
sensation
was
too
novel
not
to
disturb
his
slumbers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
slept
more
than
four
hours
.
His
fatigue
had
passed
away
.
He
was
*NL*
accustomed
not
to
devote
many
hours
to
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
his
eyes
and
stared
into
the
gloom
which
surrounded
him
;
then
*NL*
he
closed
them
again
,
with
the
intention
of
going
to
sleep
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
many
varied
sensations
have
agitated
the
day
,
when
various
matters
*NL*
preoccupy
the
mind
,
one
falls
asleep
once
,
but
not
a
second
time
.
*NL*
Sleep
comes
more
easily
than
it
returns
.
This
is
what
happened
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
He
could
not
get
to
sleep
again
,
and
he
fell
to
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
at
one
of
those
moments
when
the
thoughts
which
one
has
in
one
's
*NL*
mind
are
troubled
.
There
was
a
sort
of
dark
confusion
in
his
brain
.
His
*NL*
memories
of
the
olden
time
and
of
the
immediate
present
floated
there
*NL*
pell-mell
and
mingled
confusedly
,
losing
their
proper
forms
,
becoming
*NL*
disproportionately
large
,
then
suddenly
disappearing
,
as
in
a
muddy
and
*NL*
perturbed
pool
.
Many
thoughts
occurred
to
him
;
but
there
was
one
which
*NL*
kept
constantly
presenting
itself
afresh
,
and
which
drove
away
all
*NL*
others
.
We
will
mention
this
thought
at
once
:
he
had
observed
the
six
*NL*
sets
of
silver
forks
and
spoons
and
the
ladle
which
Madame
Magloire
had
*NL*
placed
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
six
sets
of
silver
haunted
him
.
--
They
were
there
.
--
A
few
paces
*NL*
distant
.
--
Just
as
he
was
traversing
the
adjoining
room
to
reach
the
*NL*
one
in
which
he
then
was
,
the
old
servant-woman
had
been
in
the
act
*NL*
of
placing
them
in
a
little
cupboard
near
the
head
of
the
bed
.
--
He
had
*NL*
taken
careful
note
of
this
cupboard
.
--
On
the
right
,
as
you
entered
from
*NL*
the
dining-room
.
--
They
were
solid
.
--
And
old
silver
.
--
From
the
ladle
one
*NL*
could
get
at
least
two
hundred
francs
.
--
Double
what
he
had
earned
in
*NL*
nineteen
years
.
--
It
is
true
that
he
would
have
earned
more
if
``
the
*NL*
administration
had
not
robbed
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
wavered
for
a
whole
hour
in
fluctuations
with
which
there
was
*NL*
certainly
mingled
some
struggle
.
Three
o'clock
struck
.
He
opened
his
*NL*
eyes
again
,
drew
himself
up
abruptly
into
a
sitting
posture
,
stretched
*NL*
out
his
arm
and
felt
of
his
knapsack
,
which
he
had
thrown
down
on
a
*NL*
corner
of
the
alcove
;
then
he
hung
his
legs
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
,
*NL*
and
placed
his
feet
on
the
floor
,
and
thus
found
himself
,
almost
without
*NL*
knowing
it
,
seated
on
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
for
a
time
thoughtfully
in
this
attitude
,
which
would
have
*NL*
been
suggestive
of
something
sinister
for
any
one
who
had
seen
him
*NL*
thus
in
the
dark
,
the
only
person
awake
in
that
house
where
all
were
*NL*
sleeping
.
All
of
a
sudden
he
stooped
down
,
removed
his
shoes
and
placed
*NL*
them
softly
on
the
mat
beside
the
bed
;
then
he
resumed
his
thoughtful
*NL*
attitude
,
and
became
motionless
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
this
hideous
meditation
,
the
thoughts
which
we
have
above
*NL*
indicated
moved
incessantly
through
his
brain
;
entered
,
withdrew
,
*NL*
re-entered
,
and
in
a
manner
oppressed
him
;
and
then
he
thought
,
also
,
*NL*
without
knowing
why
,
and
with
the
mechanical
persistence
of
revery
,
of
*NL*
a
convict
named
Brevet
,
whom
he
had
known
in
the
galleys
,
and
whose
*NL*
trousers
had
been
upheld
by
a
single
suspender
of
knitted
cotton
.
The
*NL*
checkered
pattern
of
that
suspender
recurred
incessantly
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
in
this
situation
,
and
would
have
so
remained
indefinitely
,
*NL*
even
until
daybreak
,
had
not
the
clock
struck
one
--
the
half
or
quarter
*NL*
hour
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
that
stroke
said
to
him
,
``
Come
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
to
his
feet
,
hesitated
still
another
moment
,
and
listened
;
all
*NL*
was
quiet
in
the
house
;
then
he
walked
straight
ahead
,
with
short
steps
,
*NL*
to
the
window
,
of
which
he
caught
a
glimpse
.
The
night
was
not
very
*NL*
dark
;
there
was
a
full
moon
,
across
which
coursed
large
clouds
driven
by
*NL*
the
wind
.
This
created
,
outdoors
,
alternate
shadow
and
gleams
of
light
,
*NL*
eclipses
,
then
bright
openings
of
the
clouds
;
and
indoors
a
sort
of
*NL*
twilight
.
This
twilight
,
sufficient
to
enable
a
person
to
see
his
way
,
*NL*
intermittent
on
account
of
the
clouds
,
resembled
the
sort
of
livid
light
*NL*
which
falls
through
an
air-hole
in
a
cellar
,
before
which
the
passersby
*NL*
come
and
go
.
On
arriving
at
the
window
,
Jean
Valjean
examined
it
.
It
had
*NL*
no
grating
;
it
opened
in
the
garden
and
was
fastened
,
according
to
the
*NL*
fashion
of
the
country
,
only
by
a
small
pin
.
He
opened
it
;
but
as
a
*NL*
rush
of
cold
and
piercing
air
penetrated
the
room
abruptly
,
he
closed
*NL*
it
again
immediately
.
He
scrutinized
the
garden
with
that
attentive
gaze
*NL*
which
studies
rather
than
looks
.
The
garden
was
enclosed
by
a
tolerably
*NL*
low
white
wall
,
easy
to
climb
.
Far
away
,
at
the
extremity
,
he
perceived
*NL*
tops
of
trees
,
spaced
at
regular
intervals
,
which
indicated
that
the
*NL*
wall
separated
the
garden
from
an
avenue
or
lane
planted
with
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
taken
this
survey
,
he
executed
a
movement
like
that
of
a
man
who
*NL*
has
made
up
his
mind
,
strode
to
his
alcove
,
grasped
his
knapsack
,
opened
*NL*
it
,
fumbled
in
it
,
pulled
out
of
it
something
which
he
placed
on
the
*NL*
bed
,
put
his
shoes
into
one
of
his
pockets
,
shut
the
whole
thing
up
*NL*
again
,
threw
the
knapsack
on
his
shoulders
,
put
on
his
cap
,
drew
the
*NL*
visor
down
over
his
eyes
,
felt
for
his
cudgel
,
went
and
placed
it
in
the
*NL*
angle
of
the
window
;
then
returned
to
the
bed
,
and
resolutely
seized
the
*NL*
object
which
he
had
deposited
there
.
It
resembled
a
short
bar
of
*NL*
iron
,
pointed
like
a
pike
at
one
end
.
It
would
have
been
difficult
to
*NL*
distinguish
in
that
darkness
for
what
employment
that
bit
of
iron
could
*NL*
have
been
designed
.
Perhaps
it
was
a
lever
;
possibly
it
was
a
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
daytime
it
would
have
been
possible
to
recognize
it
as
nothing
*NL*
more
than
a
miner
's
candlestick
.
Convicts
were
,
at
that
period
,
*NL*
sometimes
employed
in
quarrying
stone
from
the
lofty
hills
which
environ
*NL*
Toulon
,
and
it
was
not
rare
for
them
to
have
miners
'
tools
at
their
*NL*
command
.
These
miners
'
candlesticks
are
of
massive
iron
,
terminated
at
*NL*
the
lower
extremity
by
a
point
,
by
means
of
which
they
are
stuck
into
*NL*
the
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
candlestick
in
his
right
hand
;
holding
his
breath
and
trying
*NL*
to
deaden
the
sound
of
his
tread
,
he
directed
his
steps
to
the
door
of
*NL*
the
adjoining
room
,
occupied
by
the
Bishop
,
as
we
already
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
this
door
,
he
found
it
ajar
.
The
Bishop
had
not
closed
*NL*
it
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
WHAT
HE
DOES
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
listened
.
Not
a
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
the
door
a
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
it
gently
with
the
tip
of
his
finger
,
lightly
,
with
the
*NL*
furtive
and
uneasy
gentleness
of
a
cat
which
is
desirous
of
entering
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
yielded
to
this
pressure
,
and
made
an
imperceptible
and
silent
*NL*
movement
,
which
enlarged
the
opening
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
a
moment
;
then
gave
the
door
a
second
and
a
bolder
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
continued
to
yield
in
silence
.
The
opening
was
now
large
enough
to
*NL*
allow
him
to
pass
.
But
near
the
door
there
stood
a
little
table
,
which
*NL*
formed
an
embarrassing
angle
with
it
,
and
barred
the
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
recognized
the
difficulty
.
It
was
necessary
,
at
any
cost
,
*NL*
to
enlarge
the
aperture
still
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
decided
on
his
course
of
action
,
and
gave
the
door
a
third
push
,
more
*NL*
energetic
than
the
two
preceding
.
This
time
a
badly
oiled
hinge
suddenly
*NL*
emitted
amid
the
silence
a
hoarse
and
prolonged
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
shuddered
.
The
noise
of
the
hinge
rang
in
his
ears
with
*NL*
something
of
the
piercing
and
formidable
sound
of
the
trump
of
the
Day
*NL*
of
Judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
fantastic
exaggerations
of
the
first
moment
he
almost
imagined
*NL*
that
that
hinge
had
just
become
animated
,
and
had
suddenly
assumed
a
*NL*
terrible
life
,
and
that
it
was
barking
like
a
dog
to
arouse
every
one
,
*NL*
and
warn
and
to
wake
those
who
were
asleep
.
He
halted
,
shuddering
,
*NL*
bewildered
,
and
fell
back
from
the
tips
of
his
toes
upon
his
heels
.
He
*NL*
heard
the
arteries
in
his
temples
beating
like
two
forge
hammers
,
and
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
breath
issued
from
his
breast
with
the
roar
*NL*
of
the
wind
issuing
from
a
cavern
.
It
seemed
impossible
to
him
that
the
*NL*
horrible
clamor
of
that
irritated
hinge
should
not
have
disturbed
the
*NL*
entire
household
,
like
the
shock
of
an
earthquake
;
the
door
,
pushed
by
*NL*
him
,
had
taken
the
alarm
,
and
had
shouted
;
the
old
man
would
rise
at
*NL*
once
;
the
two
old
women
would
shriek
out
;
people
would
come
to
their
*NL*
assistance
;
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
town
would
be
in
an
*NL*
uproar
,
and
the
gendarmerie
on
hand
.
For
a
moment
he
thought
himself
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
where
he
was
,
petrified
like
the
statue
of
salt
,
not
daring
*NL*
to
make
a
movement
.
Several
minutes
elapsed
.
The
door
had
fallen
wide
*NL*
open
.
He
ventured
to
peep
into
the
next
room
.
Nothing
had
stirred
there
.
*NL*
He
lent
an
ear
.
Nothing
was
moving
in
the
house
.
The
noise
made
by
the
*NL*
rusty
hinge
had
not
awakened
any
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
first
danger
was
past
;
but
there
still
reigned
a
frightful
tumult
*NL*
within
him
.
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
retreat
.
Even
when
he
had
thought
*NL*
himself
lost
,
he
had
not
drawn
back
.
His
only
thought
now
was
to
finish
*NL*
as
soon
as
possible
.
He
took
a
step
and
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
room
was
in
a
state
of
perfect
calm
.
Here
and
there
vague
and
*NL*
confused
forms
were
distinguishable
,
which
in
the
daylight
were
papers
*NL*
scattered
on
a
table
,
open
folios
,
volumes
piled
upon
a
stool
,
an
*NL*
arm-chair
heaped
with
clothing
,
a
prie-Dieu
,
and
which
at
that
hour
*NL*
were
only
shadowy
corners
and
whitish
spots
.
Jean
Valjean
advanced
with
*NL*
precaution
,
taking
care
not
to
knock
against
the
furniture
.
He
could
*NL*
hear
,
at
the
extremity
of
the
room
,
the
even
and
tranquil
breathing
of
*NL*
the
sleeping
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
came
to
a
halt
.
He
was
near
the
bed
.
He
had
arrived
there
*NL*
sooner
than
he
had
thought
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
sometimes
mingles
her
effects
and
her
spectacles
with
our
actions
*NL*
with
sombre
and
intelligent
appropriateness
,
as
though
she
desired
to
*NL*
make
us
reflect
.
For
the
last
half-hour
a
large
cloud
had
covered
the
*NL*
heavens
.
At
the
moment
when
Jean
Valjean
paused
in
front
of
the
bed
,
*NL*
this
cloud
parted
,
as
though
on
purpose
,
and
a
ray
of
light
,
traversing
*NL*
the
long
window
,
suddenly
illuminated
the
Bishop
's
pale
face
.
He
was
*NL*
sleeping
peacefully
.
He
lay
in
his
bed
almost
completely
dressed
,
on
*NL*
account
of
the
cold
of
the
Basses-Alps
,
in
a
garment
of
brown
wool
,
*NL*
which
covered
his
arms
to
the
wrists
.
His
head
was
thrown
back
on
the
*NL*
pillow
,
in
the
careless
attitude
of
repose
;
his
hand
,
adorned
with
the
*NL*
pastoral
ring
,
and
whence
had
fallen
so
many
good
deeds
and
so
many
*NL*
holy
actions
,
was
hanging
over
the
edge
of
the
bed
.
His
whole
face
*NL*
was
illumined
with
a
vague
expression
of
satisfaction
,
of
hope
,
and
of
*NL*
felicity
.
It
was
more
than
a
smile
,
and
almost
a
radiance
.
He
bore
upon
*NL*
his
brow
the
indescribable
reflection
of
a
light
which
was
invisible
.
*NL*
The
soul
of
the
just
contemplates
in
sleep
a
mysterious
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
reflection
of
that
heaven
rested
on
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
luminous
transparency
,
for
that
heaven
was
*NL*
within
him
.
That
heaven
was
his
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
ray
of
moonlight
superposed
itself
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
upon
that
inward
radiance
,
the
sleeping
Bishop
seemed
as
in
a
glory
.
It
*NL*
remained
,
however
,
gentle
and
veiled
in
an
ineffable
half-light
.
That
*NL*
moon
in
the
sky
,
that
slumbering
nature
,
that
garden
without
a
quiver
,
*NL*
that
house
which
was
so
calm
,
the
hour
,
the
moment
,
the
silence
,
added
*NL*
some
solemn
and
unspeakable
quality
to
the
venerable
repose
of
this
man
,
*NL*
and
enveloped
in
a
sort
of
serene
and
majestic
aureole
that
white
*NL*
hair
,
those
closed
eyes
,
that
face
in
which
all
was
hope
and
all
was
*NL*
confidence
,
that
head
of
an
old
man
,
and
that
slumber
of
an
infant
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
almost
divine
in
this
man
,
who
was
thus
august
,
*NL*
without
being
himself
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
in
the
shadow
,
and
stood
motionless
,
with
his
iron
*NL*
candlestick
in
his
hand
,
frightened
by
this
luminous
old
man
.
Never
had
*NL*
he
beheld
anything
like
this
.
This
confidence
terrified
him
.
The
*NL*
moral
world
has
no
grander
spectacle
than
this
:
a
troubled
and
*NL*
uneasy
conscience
,
which
has
arrived
on
the
brink
of
an
evil
action
,
*NL*
contemplating
the
slumber
of
the
just
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
slumber
in
that
isolation
,
and
with
a
neighbor
like
himself
,
had
*NL*
about
it
something
sublime
,
of
which
he
was
vaguely
but
imperiously
*NL*
conscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
could
have
told
what
was
passing
within
him
,
not
even
himself
.
In
*NL*
order
to
attempt
to
form
an
idea
of
it
,
it
is
necessary
to
think
of
the
*NL*
most
violent
of
things
in
the
presence
of
the
most
gentle
.
Even
on
*NL*
his
visage
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
distinguish
anything
with
*NL*
certainty
.
It
was
a
sort
of
haggard
astonishment
.
He
gazed
at
it
,
and
*NL*
that
was
all
.
But
what
was
his
thought
?
It
would
have
been
impossible
to
*NL*
divine
it
.
What
was
evident
was
,
that
he
was
touched
and
astounded
.
But
*NL*
what
was
the
nature
of
this
emotion
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
never
quitted
the
old
man
.
The
only
thing
which
was
clearly
*NL*
to
be
inferred
from
his
attitude
and
his
physiognomy
was
a
strange
*NL*
indecision
.
One
would
have
said
that
he
was
hesitating
between
the
two
*NL*
abysses
,
--
the
one
in
which
one
loses
one
's
self
and
that
in
which
one
*NL*
saves
one
's
self
.
He
seemed
prepared
to
crush
that
skull
or
to
kiss
that
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
his
left
arm
rose
slowly
towards
*NL*
his
brow
,
and
he
took
off
his
cap
;
then
his
arm
fell
back
with
the
same
*NL*
deliberation
,
and
Jean
Valjean
fell
to
meditating
once
more
,
his
cap
in
*NL*
his
left
hand
,
his
club
in
his
right
hand
,
his
hair
bristling
all
over
*NL*
his
savage
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
continued
to
sleep
in
profound
peace
beneath
that
terrifying
*NL*
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gleam
of
the
moon
rendered
confusedly
visible
the
crucifix
over
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
which
seemed
to
be
extending
its
arms
to
both
of
them
,
*NL*
with
a
benediction
for
one
and
pardon
for
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Jean
Valjean
replaced
his
cap
on
his
brow
;
then
stepped
rapidly
*NL*
past
the
bed
,
without
glancing
at
the
Bishop
,
straight
to
the
cupboard
,
*NL*
which
he
saw
near
the
head
;
he
raised
his
iron
candlestick
as
though
to
*NL*
force
the
lock
;
the
key
was
there
;
he
opened
it
;
the
first
thing
which
*NL*
presented
itself
to
him
was
the
basket
of
silverware
;
he
seized
it
,
*NL*
traversed
the
chamber
with
long
strides
,
without
taking
any
precautions
*NL*
and
without
troubling
himself
about
the
noise
,
gained
the
door
,
*NL*
re-entered
the
oratory
,
opened
the
window
,
seized
his
cudgel
,
bestrode
*NL*
the
window-sill
of
the
ground-floor
,
put
the
silver
into
his
knapsack
,
*NL*
threw
away
the
basket
,
crossed
the
garden
,
leaped
over
the
wall
like
a
*NL*
tiger
,
and
fled
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
THE
BISHOP
WORKS
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
at
sunrise
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
was
strolling
in
his
*NL*
garden
.
Madame
Magloire
ran
up
to
him
in
utter
consternation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
Monseigneur
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
does
your
Grace
know
where
*NL*
the
basket
of
silver
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus
the
Lord
be
blessed
!
''
she
resumed
;
``
I
did
not
know
what
had
*NL*
become
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
had
just
picked
up
the
basket
in
a
flower-bed
.
He
presented
*NL*
it
to
Madame
Magloire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
she
.
``
Nothing
in
it
!
And
the
silver
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
returned
the
Bishop
,
``
so
it
is
the
silver
which
troubles
you
?
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
where
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
,
good
God
!
It
is
stolen
!
That
man
who
was
here
last
night
has
*NL*
stolen
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
twinkling
,
with
all
the
vivacity
of
an
alert
old
woman
,
Madame
*NL*
Magloire
had
rushed
to
the
oratory
,
entered
the
alcove
,
and
returned
*NL*
to
the
Bishop
.
The
Bishop
had
just
bent
down
,
and
was
sighing
as
he
*NL*
examined
a
plant
of
cochlearia
des
Guillons
,
which
the
basket
had
broken
*NL*
as
it
fell
across
the
bed
.
He
rose
up
at
Madame
Magloire
's
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
the
man
is
gone
!
The
silver
has
been
stolen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
uttered
this
exclamation
,
her
eyes
fell
upon
a
corner
of
the
*NL*
garden
,
where
traces
of
the
wall
having
been
scaled
were
visible
.
The
*NL*
coping
of
the
wall
had
been
torn
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
!
yonder
is
the
way
he
went
.
He
jumped
over
into
Cochefilet
Lane
.
*NL*
Ah
,
the
abomination
!
He
has
stolen
our
silver
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
remained
silent
for
a
moment
;
then
he
raised
his
grave
eyes
,
*NL*
and
said
gently
to
Madame
Magloire
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
in
the
first
place
,
was
that
silver
ours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
was
speechless
.
Another
silence
ensued
;
then
the
Bishop
*NL*
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Magloire
,
I
have
for
a
long
time
detained
that
silver
*NL*
wrongfully
.
It
belonged
to
the
poor
.
Who
was
that
man
?
A
poor
man
,
*NL*
evidently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
Jesus
!
''
returned
Madame
Magloire
.
``
It
is
not
for
my
sake
,
nor
for
*NL*
Mademoiselle
's
.
It
makes
no
difference
to
us
.
But
it
is
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
Monseigneur
.
What
is
Monseigneur
to
eat
with
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
gazed
at
her
with
an
air
of
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
!
Are
there
no
such
things
as
pewter
forks
and
spoons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pewter
has
an
odor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iron
forks
and
spoons
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Magloire
made
an
expressive
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iron
has
a
taste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
the
Bishop
;
``
wooden
ones
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
he
was
breakfasting
at
the
very
table
at
which
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
sat
on
the
previous
evening
.
As
he
ate
his
breakfast
,
*NL*
Monseigneur
Welcome
remarked
gayly
to
his
sister
,
who
said
nothing
,
and
*NL*
to
Madame
Magloire
,
who
was
grumbling
under
her
breath
,
that
one
really
*NL*
does
not
need
either
fork
or
spoon
,
even
of
wood
,
in
order
to
dip
a
bit
*NL*
of
bread
in
a
cup
of
milk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
idea
,
truly
,
''
said
Madame
Magloire
to
herself
,
as
she
went
and
*NL*
came
,
``
to
take
in
a
man
like
that
!
and
to
lodge
him
close
to
one
's
self
!
*NL*
And
how
fortunate
that
he
did
nothing
but
steal
!
Ah
,
mon
Dieu
!
it
makes
*NL*
one
shudder
to
think
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
brother
and
sister
were
about
to
rise
from
the
table
,
there
came
*NL*
a
knock
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
said
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
A
singular
and
violent
group
made
its
appearance
on
the
*NL*
threshold
.
Three
men
were
holding
a
fourth
man
by
the
collar
.
The
three
*NL*
men
were
gendarmes
;
the
other
was
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
brigadier
of
gendarmes
,
who
seemed
to
be
in
command
of
the
group
,
was
*NL*
standing
near
the
door
.
He
entered
and
advanced
to
the
Bishop
,
making
a
*NL*
military
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
--
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
word
,
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
dejected
and
seemed
overwhelmed
,
*NL*
raised
his
head
with
an
air
of
stupefaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
!
''
he
murmured
.
``
So
he
is
not
the
cure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
!
''
said
the
gendarme
.
``
He
is
Monseigneur
the
Bishop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
had
advanced
as
quickly
as
his
*NL*
great
age
permitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
here
you
are
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
looking
at
Jean
Valjean
.
``
I
am
glad
to
*NL*
see
you
.
Well
,
but
how
is
this
?
I
gave
you
the
candlesticks
too
,
which
*NL*
are
of
silver
like
the
rest
,
and
for
which
you
can
certainly
get
two
*NL*
hundred
francs
.
Why
did
you
not
carry
them
away
with
your
forks
and
*NL*
spoons
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
opened
his
eyes
wide
,
and
stared
at
the
venerable
Bishop
*NL*
with
an
expression
which
no
human
tongue
can
render
any
account
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monseigneur
,
''
said
the
brigadier
of
gendarmes
,
``
so
what
this
man
said
*NL*
is
true
,
then
?
We
came
across
him
.
He
was
walking
like
a
man
who
is
*NL*
running
away
.
We
stopped
him
to
look
into
the
matter
.
He
had
this
*NL*
silver
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
told
you
,
''
interposed
the
Bishop
with
a
smile
,
``
that
it
had
been
*NL*
given
to
him
by
a
kind
old
fellow
of
a
priest
with
whom
he
had
passed
*NL*
the
night
?
I
see
how
the
matter
stands
.
And
you
have
brought
him
back
*NL*
here
?
It
is
a
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
''
replied
the
brigadier
,
``
we
can
let
him
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
replied
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gendarmes
released
Jean
Valjean
,
who
recoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
that
I
am
to
be
released
?
''
he
said
,
in
an
almost
*NL*
inarticulate
voice
,
and
as
though
he
were
talking
in
his
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
thou
art
released
;
dost
thou
not
understand
?
''
said
one
of
the
*NL*
gendarmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
resumed
the
Bishop
,
``
before
you
go
,
here
are
your
*NL*
candlesticks
.
Take
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
to
the
chimney-piece
,
took
the
two
silver
candlesticks
,
and
*NL*
brought
them
to
Jean
Valjean
.
The
two
women
looked
on
without
uttering
*NL*
a
word
,
without
a
gesture
,
without
a
look
which
could
disconcert
the
*NL*
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
trembling
in
every
limb
.
He
took
the
two
candlesticks
*NL*
mechanically
,
and
with
a
bewildered
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
the
Bishop
,
``
go
in
peace
.
By
the
way
,
when
you
return
,
my
*NL*
friend
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
pass
through
the
garden
.
You
can
always
*NL*
enter
and
depart
through
the
street
door
.
It
is
never
fastened
with
*NL*
anything
but
a
latch
,
either
by
day
or
by
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
turning
to
the
gendarmes
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
retire
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gendarmes
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
like
a
man
on
the
point
of
fainting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
drew
near
to
him
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
forget
,
never
forget
,
that
you
have
promised
to
use
this
money
*NL*
in
becoming
an
honest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
who
had
no
recollection
of
ever
having
promised
anything
,
*NL*
remained
speechless
.
The
Bishop
had
emphasized
the
words
when
he
uttered
*NL*
them
.
He
resumed
with
solemnity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jean
Valjean
,
my
brother
,
you
no
longer
belong
to
evil
,
but
to
good
.
It
*NL*
is
your
soul
that
I
buy
from
you
;
I
withdraw
it
from
black
thoughts
and
*NL*
the
spirit
of
perdition
,
and
I
give
it
to
God
.

CHAPTER
XIII
--
LITTLE
GERVAIS
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
left
the
town
as
though
he
were
fleeing
from
it
.
He
set
out
*NL*
at
a
very
hasty
pace
through
the
fields
,
taking
whatever
roads
and
paths
*NL*
presented
themselves
to
him
,
without
perceiving
that
he
was
incessantly
*NL*
retracing
his
steps
.
He
wandered
thus
the
whole
morning
,
without
having
*NL*
eaten
anything
and
without
feeling
hungry
.
He
was
the
prey
of
a
throng
*NL*
of
novel
sensations
.
He
was
conscious
of
a
sort
of
rage
;
he
did
not
*NL*
know
against
whom
it
was
directed
.
He
could
not
have
told
whether
he
was
*NL*
touched
or
humiliated
.
There
came
over
him
at
moments
a
strange
emotion
*NL*
which
he
resisted
and
to
which
he
opposed
the
hardness
acquired
during
*NL*
the
last
twenty
years
of
his
life
.
This
state
of
mind
fatigued
him
.
*NL*
He
perceived
with
dismay
that
the
sort
of
frightful
calm
which
the
*NL*
injustice
of
his
misfortune
had
conferred
upon
him
was
giving
way
within
*NL*
him
.
He
asked
himself
what
would
replace
this
.
At
times
he
would
have
*NL*
actually
preferred
to
be
in
prison
with
the
gendarmes
,
and
that
things
*NL*
should
not
have
happened
in
this
way
;
it
would
have
agitated
him
less
.
*NL*
Although
the
season
was
tolerably
far
advanced
,
there
were
still
a
few
*NL*
late
flowers
in
the
hedge-rows
here
and
there
,
whose
odor
as
he
passed
*NL*
through
them
in
his
march
recalled
to
him
memories
of
his
childhood
.
*NL*
These
memories
were
almost
intolerable
to
him
,
it
was
so
long
since
they
*NL*
had
recurred
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unutterable
thoughts
assembled
within
him
in
this
manner
all
day
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
sun
declined
to
its
setting
,
casting
long
shadows
athwart
the
*NL*
soil
from
every
pebble
,
Jean
Valjean
sat
down
behind
a
bush
upon
a
large
*NL*
ruddy
plain
,
which
was
absolutely
deserted
.
There
was
nothing
on
the
*NL*
horizon
except
the
Alps
.
Not
even
the
spire
of
a
distant
village
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
might
have
been
three
leagues
distant
from
D
--
A
path
which
*NL*
intersected
the
plain
passed
a
few
paces
from
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
this
meditation
,
which
would
have
contributed
not
*NL*
a
little
to
render
his
rags
terrifying
to
any
one
who
might
have
*NL*
encountered
him
,
a
joyous
sound
became
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
head
and
saw
a
little
Savoyard
,
about
ten
years
of
age
,
*NL*
coming
up
the
path
and
singing
,
his
hurdy-gurdy
on
his
hip
,
and
his
*NL*
marmot-box
on
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
those
gay
and
gentle
children
,
who
go
from
land
to
land
affording
*NL*
a
view
of
their
knees
through
the
holes
in
their
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
stopping
his
song
,
the
lad
halted
in
his
march
from
time
to
*NL*
time
,
and
played
at
knuckle-bones
with
some
coins
which
he
had
in
his
*NL*
hand
--
his
whole
fortune
,
probably
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
this
money
there
was
one
forty-sou
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
halted
beside
the
bush
,
without
perceiving
Jean
Valjean
,
and
*NL*
tossed
up
his
handful
of
sous
,
which
,
up
to
that
time
,
he
had
caught
*NL*
with
a
good
deal
of
adroitness
on
the
back
of
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
the
forty-sou
piece
escaped
him
,
and
went
rolling
towards
the
*NL*
brushwood
until
it
reached
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
set
his
foot
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
child
had
looked
after
his
coin
and
had
caught
*NL*
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
showed
no
astonishment
,
but
walked
straight
up
to
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spot
was
absolutely
solitary
.
As
far
as
the
eye
could
see
there
was
*NL*
not
a
person
on
the
plain
or
on
the
path
.
The
only
sound
was
the
tiny
,
*NL*
feeble
cries
of
a
flock
of
birds
of
passage
,
which
was
traversing
the
*NL*
heavens
at
an
immense
height
.
The
child
was
standing
with
his
back
to
*NL*
the
sun
,
which
cast
threads
of
gold
in
his
hair
and
empurpled
with
its
*NL*
blood-red
gleam
the
savage
face
of
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
the
little
Savoyard
,
with
that
childish
confidence
which
is
*NL*
composed
of
ignorance
and
innocence
,
``
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Gervais
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
resumed
the
child
,
``
give
me
back
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
dropped
his
head
,
and
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
began
again
,
``
My
money
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
eyes
remained
fixed
on
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
piece
of
money
!
''
cried
the
child
,
``
my
white
piece
!
my
silver
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
though
Jean
Valjean
did
not
hear
him
.
The
child
grasped
him
*NL*
by
the
collar
of
his
blouse
and
shook
him
.
At
the
same
time
he
made
an
*NL*
effort
to
displace
the
big
iron-shod
shoe
which
rested
on
his
treasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
my
piece
of
money
!
my
piece
of
forty
sous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
wept
.
Jean
Valjean
raised
his
head
.
He
still
remained
seated
.
*NL*
His
eyes
were
troubled
.
He
gazed
at
the
child
,
in
a
sort
of
amazement
,
*NL*
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
towards
his
cudgel
and
cried
in
a
*NL*
terrible
voice
,
``
Who
's
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
sir
,
''
replied
the
child
.
``
Little
Gervais
!
I
!
Give
me
back
my
forty
*NL*
sous
,
if
you
please
!
Take
your
foot
away
,
sir
,
if
you
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
irritated
,
though
he
was
so
small
,
and
becoming
almost
menacing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
will
you
take
your
foot
away
?
Take
your
foot
away
,
or
we
'll
*NL*
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
It
's
still
you
!
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
and
rising
abruptly
to
his
*NL*
feet
,
his
foot
still
resting
on
the
silver
piece
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
take
yourself
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
frightened
child
looked
at
him
,
then
began
to
tremble
from
head
to
*NL*
foot
,
and
after
a
few
moments
of
stupor
he
set
out
,
running
at
the
top
*NL*
of
his
speed
,
without
daring
to
turn
his
neck
or
to
utter
a
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
lack
of
breath
forced
him
to
halt
after
a
certain
*NL*
distance
,
and
Jean
Valjean
heard
him
sobbing
,
in
the
midst
of
his
own
*NL*
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
a
few
moments
the
child
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
set
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadows
were
descending
around
Jean
Valjean
.
He
had
eaten
nothing
*NL*
all
day
;
it
is
probable
that
he
was
feverish
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
remained
standing
and
had
not
changed
his
attitude
after
the
*NL*
child
's
flight
.
The
breath
heaved
his
chest
at
long
and
irregular
*NL*
intervals
.
His
gaze
,
fixed
ten
or
twelve
paces
in
front
of
him
,
seemed
*NL*
to
be
scrutinizing
with
profound
attention
the
shape
of
an
ancient
*NL*
fragment
of
blue
earthenware
which
had
fallen
in
the
grass
.
All
at
once
*NL*
he
shivered
;
he
had
just
begun
to
feel
the
chill
of
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
settled
his
cap
more
firmly
on
his
brow
,
sought
mechanically
to
*NL*
cross
and
button
his
blouse
,
advanced
a
step
and
stopped
to
pick
up
his
*NL*
cudgel
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
he
caught
sight
of
the
forty-sou
piece
,
which
his
foot
*NL*
had
half
ground
into
the
earth
,
and
which
was
shining
among
the
pebbles
.
*NL*
It
was
as
though
he
had
received
a
galvanic
shock
.
``
What
is
this
?
''
*NL*
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
.
He
recoiled
three
paces
,
then
halted
,
*NL*
without
being
able
to
detach
his
gaze
from
the
spot
which
his
foot
had
*NL*
trodden
but
an
instant
before
,
as
though
the
thing
which
lay
glittering
*NL*
there
in
the
gloom
had
been
an
open
eye
riveted
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
he
darted
convulsively
towards
the
*NL*
silver
coin
,
seized
it
,
and
straightened
himself
up
again
and
began
to
*NL*
gaze
afar
off
over
the
plain
,
at
the
same
time
casting
his
eyes
towards
*NL*
all
points
of
the
horizon
,
as
he
stood
there
erect
and
shivering
,
like
a
*NL*
terrified
wild
animal
which
is
seeking
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
nothing
.
Night
was
falling
,
the
plain
was
cold
and
vague
,
great
*NL*
banks
of
violet
haze
were
rising
in
the
gleam
of
the
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
``
Ah
!
''
and
set
out
rapidly
in
the
direction
in
which
the
child
*NL*
had
disappeared
.
After
about
thirty
paces
he
paused
,
looked
about
him
*NL*
and
saw
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
shouted
with
all
his
might
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Gervais
!
Little
Gervais
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landscape
was
gloomy
and
deserted
.
He
was
encompassed
by
space
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
around
him
but
an
obscurity
in
which
his
gaze
was
*NL*
lost
,
and
a
silence
which
engulfed
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
icy
north
wind
was
blowing
,
and
imparted
to
things
around
him
a
*NL*
sort
of
lugubrious
life
.
The
bushes
shook
their
thin
little
arms
with
*NL*
incredible
fury
.
One
would
have
said
that
they
were
threatening
and
*NL*
pursuing
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
on
his
march
again
,
then
he
began
to
run
;
and
from
time
to
*NL*
time
he
halted
and
shouted
into
that
solitude
,
with
a
voice
which
was
*NL*
the
most
formidable
and
the
most
disconsolate
that
it
was
possible
to
*NL*
hear
,
``
Little
Gervais
!
Little
Gervais
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Assuredly
,
if
the
child
had
heard
him
,
he
would
have
been
alarmed
and
*NL*
would
have
taken
good
care
not
to
show
himself
.
But
the
child
was
no
*NL*
doubt
already
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
encountered
a
priest
on
horseback
.
He
stepped
up
to
him
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Cure
,
have
you
seen
a
child
pass
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
named
Little
Gervais
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
no
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
two
five-franc
pieces
from
his
money-bag
and
handed
them
to
the
*NL*
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Cure
,
this
is
for
your
poor
people
.
Monsieur
le
Cure
,
he
*NL*
was
a
little
lad
,
about
ten
years
old
,
with
a
marmot
,
I
think
,
and
a
*NL*
hurdy-gurdy
.
One
of
those
Savoyards
,
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
seen
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Gervais
?
There
are
no
villages
here
?
Can
you
tell
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
like
what
you
say
,
my
friend
,
he
is
a
little
stranger
.
Such
*NL*
persons
pass
through
these
parts
.
We
know
nothing
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
seized
two
more
coins
of
five
francs
each
with
violence
,
*NL*
and
gave
them
to
the
priest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
your
poor
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
added
,
wildly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
l'Abbe
,
have
me
arrested
.
I
am
a
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
priest
put
spurs
to
his
horse
and
fled
in
haste
,
much
alarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
set
out
on
a
run
,
in
the
direction
which
he
had
first
*NL*
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
he
traversed
a
tolerably
long
distance
,
gazing
,
calling
,
*NL*
shouting
,
but
he
met
no
one
.
Two
or
three
times
he
ran
across
the
plain
*NL*
towards
something
which
conveyed
to
him
the
effect
of
a
human
being
*NL*
reclining
or
crouching
down
;
it
turned
out
to
be
nothing
but
brushwood
*NL*
or
rocks
nearly
on
a
level
with
the
earth
.
At
length
,
at
a
spot
where
*NL*
three
paths
intersected
each
other
,
he
stopped
.
The
moon
had
risen
.
He
*NL*
sent
his
gaze
into
the
distance
and
shouted
for
the
last
time
,
``
Little
*NL*
Gervais
!
Little
Gervais
!
Little
Gervais
!
''
His
shout
died
away
in
the
*NL*
mist
,
without
even
awakening
an
echo
.
He
murmured
yet
once
more
,
``
Little
*NL*
Gervais
!
''
but
in
a
feeble
and
almost
inarticulate
voice
.
It
was
his
last
*NL*
effort
;
his
legs
gave
way
abruptly
under
him
,
as
though
an
invisible
*NL*
power
had
suddenly
overwhelmed
him
with
the
weight
of
his
evil
*NL*
conscience
;
he
fell
exhausted
,
on
a
large
stone
,
his
fists
clenched
in
*NL*
his
hair
and
his
face
on
his
knees
,
and
he
cried
,
``
I
am
a
wretch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
heart
burst
,
and
he
began
to
cry
.
It
was
the
first
time
that
he
*NL*
had
wept
in
nineteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jean
Valjean
left
the
Bishop
's
house
,
he
was
,
as
we
have
seen
,
*NL*
quite
thrown
out
of
everything
that
had
been
his
thought
hitherto
.
He
*NL*
could
not
yield
to
the
evidence
of
what
was
going
on
within
him
.
He
*NL*
hardened
himself
against
the
angelic
action
and
the
gentle
words
of
the
*NL*
old
man
.
``
You
have
promised
me
to
become
an
honest
man
.
I
buy
your
soul
.
*NL*
I
take
it
away
from
the
spirit
of
perversity
;
I
give
it
to
the
good
*NL*
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
recurred
to
his
mind
unceasingly
.
To
this
celestial
kindness
*NL*
he
opposed
pride
,
which
is
the
fortress
of
evil
within
us
.
He
was
*NL*
indistinctly
conscious
that
the
pardon
of
this
priest
was
the
greatest
*NL*
assault
and
the
most
formidable
attack
which
had
moved
him
yet
;
that
his
*NL*
obduracy
was
finally
settled
if
he
resisted
this
clemency
;
that
if
he
*NL*
yielded
,
he
should
be
obliged
to
renounce
that
hatred
with
which
the
*NL*
actions
of
other
men
had
filled
his
soul
through
so
many
years
,
and
*NL*
which
pleased
him
;
that
this
time
it
was
necessary
to
conquer
or
to
be
*NL*
conquered
;
and
that
a
struggle
,
a
colossal
and
final
struggle
,
had
been
*NL*
begun
between
his
viciousness
and
the
goodness
of
that
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
presence
of
these
lights
,
he
proceeded
like
a
man
who
is
*NL*
intoxicated
.
As
he
walked
thus
with
haggard
eyes
,
did
he
have
a
distinct
*NL*
perception
of
what
might
result
to
him
from
his
adventure
at
D
--
?
Did
*NL*
he
understand
all
those
mysterious
murmurs
which
warn
or
importune
the
*NL*
spirit
at
certain
moments
of
life
?
Did
a
voice
whisper
in
his
ear
that
*NL*
he
had
just
passed
the
solemn
hour
of
his
destiny
;
that
there
no
longer
*NL*
remained
a
middle
course
for
him
;
that
if
he
were
not
henceforth
the
*NL*
best
of
men
,
he
would
be
the
worst
;
that
it
behooved
him
now
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
to
mount
higher
than
the
Bishop
,
or
fall
lower
than
the
convict
;
*NL*
that
if
he
wished
to
become
good
be
must
become
an
angel
;
that
if
he
*NL*
wished
to
remain
evil
,
he
must
become
a
monster
?
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
again
,
some
questions
must
be
put
,
which
we
have
already
put
*NL*
to
ourselves
elsewhere
:
did
he
catch
some
shadow
of
all
this
in
his
*NL*
thought
,
in
a
confused
way
?
Misfortune
certainly
,
as
we
have
said
,
does
*NL*
form
the
education
of
the
intelligence
;
nevertheless
,
it
is
doubtful
*NL*
whether
Jean
Valjean
was
in
a
condition
to
disentangle
all
that
we
have
*NL*
here
indicated
.
If
these
ideas
occurred
to
him
,
he
but
caught
glimpses
*NL*
of
,
rather
than
saw
them
,
and
they
only
succeeded
in
throwing
him
into
*NL*
an
unutterable
and
almost
painful
state
of
emotion
.
On
emerging
from
*NL*
that
black
and
deformed
thing
which
is
called
the
galleys
,
the
Bishop
*NL*
had
hurt
his
soul
,
as
too
vivid
a
light
would
have
hurt
his
eyes
on
*NL*
emerging
from
the
dark
.
The
future
life
,
the
possible
life
which
offered
*NL*
itself
to
him
henceforth
,
all
pure
and
radiant
,
filled
him
with
tremors
*NL*
and
anxiety
.
He
no
longer
knew
where
he
really
was
.
Like
an
owl
,
who
*NL*
should
suddenly
see
the
sun
rise
,
the
convict
had
been
dazzled
and
*NL*
blinded
,
as
it
were
,
by
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
was
certain
,
that
which
he
did
not
doubt
,
was
that
he
was
no
*NL*
longer
the
same
man
,
that
everything
about
him
was
changed
,
that
it
was
*NL*
no
longer
in
his
power
to
make
it
as
though
the
Bishop
had
not
spoken
to
*NL*
him
and
had
not
touched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
he
had
encountered
little
Gervais
,
and
had
robbed
*NL*
him
of
his
forty
sous
.
Why
?
He
certainly
could
not
have
explained
it
;
*NL*
was
this
the
last
effect
and
the
supreme
effort
,
as
it
were
,
of
the
*NL*
evil
thoughts
which
he
had
brought
away
from
the
galleys
,
--
a
remnant
of
*NL*
impulse
,
a
result
of
what
is
called
in
statics
,
acquired
force
?
It
*NL*
was
that
,
and
it
was
also
,
perhaps
,
even
less
than
that
.
Let
us
say
it
*NL*
simply
,
it
was
not
he
who
stole
;
it
was
not
the
man
;
it
was
the
beast
,
*NL*
who
,
by
habit
and
instinct
,
had
simply
placed
his
foot
upon
that
money
,
*NL*
while
the
intelligence
was
struggling
amid
so
many
novel
and
hitherto
*NL*
unheard-of
thoughts
besetting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
intelligence
re-awakened
and
beheld
that
action
of
the
brute
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
recoiled
with
anguish
and
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
because
,
--
strange
phenomenon
,
and
one
which
was
possible
only
*NL*
in
the
situation
in
which
he
found
himself
,
--
in
stealing
the
money
from
*NL*
that
child
,
he
had
done
a
thing
of
which
he
was
no
longer
capable
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
that
may
be
,
this
last
evil
action
had
a
decisive
effect
on
*NL*
him
;
it
abruptly
traversed
that
chaos
which
he
bore
in
his
mind
,
and
*NL*
dispersed
it
,
placed
on
one
side
the
thick
obscurity
,
and
on
the
other
*NL*
the
light
,
and
acted
on
his
soul
,
in
the
state
in
which
it
then
was
,
as
*NL*
certain
chemical
reagents
act
upon
a
troubled
mixture
by
precipitating
*NL*
one
element
and
clarifying
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
of
all
,
even
before
examining
himself
and
reflecting
,
all
*NL*
bewildered
,
like
one
who
seeks
to
save
himself
,
he
tried
to
find
the
*NL*
child
in
order
to
return
his
money
to
him
;
then
,
when
he
recognized
the
*NL*
fact
that
this
was
impossible
,
he
halted
in
despair
.
At
the
moment
when
*NL*
he
exclaimed
``
I
am
a
wretch
!
''
he
had
just
perceived
what
he
was
,
and
he
*NL*
was
already
separated
from
himself
to
such
a
degree
,
that
he
seemed
to
*NL*
himself
to
be
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
phantom
,
and
as
if
he
had
,
*NL*
there
before
him
,
in
flesh
and
blood
,
the
hideous
galley-convict
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
cudgel
in
hand
,
his
blouse
on
his
hips
,
his
knapsack
filled
*NL*
with
stolen
objects
on
his
back
,
with
his
resolute
and
gloomy
visage
,
*NL*
with
his
thoughts
filled
with
abominable
projects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excess
of
unhappiness
had
,
as
we
have
remarked
,
made
him
in
some
sort
*NL*
a
visionary
.
This
,
then
,
was
in
the
nature
of
a
vision
.
He
actually
saw
*NL*
that
Jean
Valjean
,
that
sinister
face
,
before
him
.
He
had
almost
reached
*NL*
the
point
of
asking
himself
who
that
man
was
,
and
he
was
horrified
by
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brain
was
going
through
one
of
those
violent
and
yet
perfectly
calm
*NL*
moments
in
which
revery
is
so
profound
that
it
absorbs
reality
.
One
no
*NL*
longer
beholds
the
object
which
one
has
before
one
,
and
one
sees
,
as
*NL*
though
apart
from
one
's
self
,
the
figures
which
one
has
in
one
's
own
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
contemplated
himself
,
so
to
speak
,
face
to
face
,
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
athwart
this
hallucination
,
he
perceived
in
a
mysterious
depth
a
*NL*
sort
of
light
which
he
at
first
took
for
a
torch
.
On
scrutinizing
*NL*
this
light
which
appeared
to
his
conscience
with
more
attention
,
he
*NL*
recognized
the
fact
that
it
possessed
a
human
form
and
that
this
torch
*NL*
was
the
Bishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
conscience
weighed
in
turn
these
two
men
thus
placed
before
it
,
--
the
*NL*
Bishop
and
Jean
Valjean
.
Nothing
less
than
the
first
was
required
to
*NL*
soften
the
second
.
By
one
of
those
singular
effects
,
which
are
peculiar
*NL*
to
this
sort
of
ecstasies
,
in
proportion
as
his
revery
continued
,
as
the
*NL*
Bishop
grew
great
and
resplendent
in
his
eyes
,
so
did
Jean
Valjean
grow
*NL*
less
and
vanish
.
After
a
certain
time
he
was
no
longer
anything
more
*NL*
than
a
shade
.
All
at
once
he
disappeared
.
The
Bishop
alone
remained
;
he
*NL*
filled
the
whole
soul
of
this
wretched
man
with
a
magnificent
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
wept
for
a
long
time
.
He
wept
burning
tears
,
he
sobbed
with
*NL*
more
weakness
than
a
woman
,
with
more
fright
than
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
wept
,
daylight
penetrated
more
and
more
clearly
into
his
soul
;
an
*NL*
extraordinary
light
;
a
light
at
once
ravishing
and
terrible
.
His
past
*NL*
life
,
his
first
fault
,
his
long
expiation
,
his
external
brutishness
,
his
*NL*
internal
hardness
,
his
dismissal
to
liberty
,
rejoicing
in
manifold
plans
*NL*
of
vengeance
,
what
had
happened
to
him
at
the
Bishop
's
,
the
last
thing
*NL*
that
he
had
done
,
that
theft
of
forty
sous
from
a
child
,
a
crime
all
the
*NL*
more
cowardly
,
and
all
the
more
monstrous
since
it
had
come
after
the
*NL*
Bishop
's
pardon
,
--
all
this
recurred
to
his
mind
and
appeared
clearly
*NL*
to
him
,
but
with
a
clearness
which
he
had
never
hitherto
witnessed
.
*NL*
He
examined
his
life
,
and
it
seemed
horrible
to
him
;
his
soul
,
and
it
*NL*
seemed
frightful
to
him
.
In
the
meantime
a
gentle
light
rested
over
this
*NL*
life
and
this
soul
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
beheld
Satan
by
the
light
*NL*
of
Paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
many
hours
did
he
weep
thus
?
What
did
he
do
after
he
had
wept
?
*NL*
Whither
did
he
go
!
No
one
ever
knew
.
The
only
thing
which
seems
to
be
*NL*
authenticated
is
that
that
same
night
the
carrier
who
served
Grenoble
at
*NL*
that
epoch
,
and
who
arrived
at
D
--
about
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
saw
,
as
he
traversed
the
street
in
which
the
Bishop
's
residence
was
*NL*
situated
,
a
man
in
the
attitude
of
prayer
,
kneeling
on
the
pavement
in
*NL*
the
shadow
,
in
front
of
the
door
of
Monseigneur
Welcome

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
YEAR
1817
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
1817
is
the
year
which
Louis
XVIII.
,
with
a
certain
royal
assurance
*NL*
which
was
not
wanting
in
pride
,
entitled
the
twenty-second
of
his
reign
.
*NL*
It
is
the
year
in
which
M.
Bruguiere
de
Sorsum
was
celebrated
.
All
the
*NL*
hairdressers
'
shops
,
hoping
for
powder
and
the
return
of
the
royal
bird
,
*NL*
were
besmeared
with
azure
and
decked
with
fleurs-de-lys
.
It
was
the
*NL*
candid
time
at
which
Count
Lynch
sat
every
Sunday
as
church-warden
in
*NL*
the
church-warden
's
pew
of
Saint-Germain-des-Pres
,
in
his
costume
of
a
*NL*
peer
of
France
,
with
his
red
ribbon
and
his
long
nose
and
the
majesty
*NL*
of
profile
peculiar
to
a
man
who
has
performed
a
brilliant
action
.
*NL*
The
brilliant
action
performed
by
M.
Lynch
was
this
:
being
mayor
of
*NL*
Bordeaux
,
on
the
12th
of
March
,
1814
,
he
had
surrendered
the
city
a
*NL*
little
too
promptly
to
M.
the
Duke
d'Angouleme
.
Hence
his
peerage
.
In
*NL*
1817
fashion
swallowed
up
little
boys
of
from
four
to
six
years
of
*NL*
age
in
vast
caps
of
morocco
leather
with
ear-tabs
resembling
Esquimaux
*NL*
mitres
.
The
French
army
was
dressed
in
white
,
after
the
mode
of
the
*NL*
Austrian
;
the
regiments
were
called
legions
;
instead
of
numbers
they
*NL*
bore
the
names
of
departments
;
Napoleon
was
at
St.
Helena
;
and
since
*NL*
England
refused
him
green
cloth
,
he
was
having
his
old
coats
turned
.
*NL*
In
1817
Pelligrini
sang
;
Mademoiselle
Bigottini
danced
;
Potier
reigned
;
*NL*
Odry
did
not
yet
exist
.
Madame
Saqui
had
succeeded
to
Forioso
.
There
*NL*
were
still
Prussians
in
France
.
M.
Delalot
was
a
personage
.
Legitimacy
*NL*
had
just
asserted
itself
by
cutting
off
the
hand
,
then
the
head
,
of
*NL*
Pleignier
,
of
Carbonneau
,
and
of
Tolleron
.
The
Prince
de
Talleyrand
,
*NL*
grand
chamberlain
,
and
the
Abbe
Louis
,
appointed
minister
of
finance
,
*NL*
laughed
as
they
looked
at
each
other
,
with
the
laugh
of
the
two
augurs
;
*NL*
both
of
them
had
celebrated
,
on
the
14th
of
July
,
1790
,
the
mass
of
*NL*
federation
in
the
Champ
de
Mars
;
Talleyrand
had
said
it
as
bishop
,
Louis
*NL*
had
served
it
in
the
capacity
of
deacon
.
In
1817
,
in
the
side-alleys
*NL*
of
this
same
Champ
de
Mars
,
two
great
cylinders
of
wood
might
have
*NL*
been
seen
lying
in
the
rain
,
rotting
amid
the
grass
,
painted
blue
,
with
*NL*
traces
of
eagles
and
bees
,
from
which
the
gilding
was
falling
.
These
*NL*
were
the
columns
which
two
years
before
had
upheld
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
platform
in
the
Champ
de
Mai
.
They
were
blackened
here
and
there
with
*NL*
the
scorches
of
the
bivouac
of
Austrians
encamped
near
Gros-Caillou
.
Two
*NL*
or
three
of
these
columns
had
disappeared
in
these
bivouac
fires
,
and
*NL*
had
warmed
the
large
hands
of
the
Imperial
troops
.
The
Field
of
May
had
*NL*
this
remarkable
point
:
that
it
had
been
held
in
the
month
of
June
and
in
*NL*
the
Field
of
March

In
this
year
,
1817
,
two
things
were
popular

*NL*
the

and
the
snuff-box
a
la
Charter
.
The
most
recent
*NL*
Parisian
sensation
was
the
crime
of
Dautun
,
who
had
thrown
his
brother
's
*NL*
head
into
the
fountain
of
the
Flower-Market
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
begun
to
feel
anxious
at
the
Naval
Department
,
on
account
of
*NL*
the
lack
of
news
from
that
fatal
frigate
,
The
Medusa
,
which
was
destined
*NL*
to
cover
Chaumareix
with
infamy
and
Gericault
with
glory
.
Colonel

*NL*
was
going

On

platform
of
*NL*
the
octagonal
tower
of
the
Hotel

Cluny
,
the
little
shed
of

,
*NL*
which
had
served
as
an

the
naval
astronomer
*NL*
under
Louis
XVI.

was
still
to
be
seen
.
The
Duchesse
de
Duras
read
to
*NL*
three
or
four
friends
her
unpublished

,
in
her
boudoir
furnished
*NL*
by
X.
in
sky-blue

The

scratched
off
the
Louvre
.
The
*NL*
bridge
of
Austerlitz
had
abdicated
,
and
was
entitled
the
bridge
of
the
*NL*
King
's
Garden
-LSB-
du
Jardin
du
Roi
-RSB-
,
a
double
enigma
,
which
disguised
the
*NL*
bridge
of
Austerlitz
and
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
at
one
stroke
.
Louis
*NL*
XVIII.
,
much
preoccupied
while
annotating
Horace
with
the
corner
of
his
*NL*
finger-nail
,
heroes
who
have
become
emperors
,
and
makers
of
wooden
shoes
*NL*
who
have
become

,
had
two

Napoleon
and
Mathurin
*NL*
Bruneau

The
*NL*
Happiness
procured
through

.
M.
Bellart
was
officially
eloquent
.
*NL*
In
his
shadow
could
be
seen
germinating
that
future
advocate-general
of
*NL*
Broe
,
dedicated
to
the
sarcasms
of
Paul-Louis
Courier
.
There
was
a
false
*NL*
Chateaubriand
,
named

The

had
the
academician
,
Napoleon
Bonaparte
,
stricken
*NL*

its
list
of

.
A
royal
ordinance
erected
Angouleme
into
a
*NL*
naval
school
;
for
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
,
being
lord
high
admiral
,
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
the
city
of
Angouleme
had
all
the
qualities
of
a
seaport
;
*NL*
otherwise
the
monarchical
principle
would
have
received
a
wound
.
In
*NL*
the
Council
of
Ministers
the
question
was
agitated
whether
vignettes
*NL*
representing
slack-rope
performances
,
which
adorned
Franconi
's
*NL*
advertising
posters
,
and
which
attracted
throngs
of
street
urchins
,
*NL*
should
be
tolerated
.
M.
Paer
,
the
author
of
Agnese
,
a
good
sort
of
*NL*
fellow
,
with
a
square
face
and
a
wart
on
his
cheek
,
directed
the
little
*NL*
private
concerts
of
the
Marquise
de
Sasenaye
in
the
Rue
Ville
l'Eveque
.
*NL*
All
the

were
singing
the
Hermit

Saint-Avelle
,
with

Edmond
Geraud
.
The
Yellow

was
transferred
into

The
Cafe
*NL*
Lemblin
stood
up

the
Emperor
,
against
the
Cafe
Valois
,
which
upheld
*NL*
the
Bourbons
.
The
Duc
de
Berri
,
already
surveyed
from

Louvel
,
had

been
married
to
a

of
Sicily
.
Madame

The

*NL*
The
grand
newspapers
were
all
very
small
.
Their
form
was
restricted
,
*NL*
but
their
liberty
was
great
.
The
Constitutionnel
was
constitutional

*NL*
La
Minerve
called
Chateaubriand
Chateaubriant
.
That
made
the
good
*NL*
middle-class
people
laugh
heartily
at
the
expense
of
the
great
writer
.
*NL*
In
journals
which
sold
themselves
,
prostituted
journalists
,
insulted
the
*NL*
exiles
of
1815
.
David
had
no
longer
any
talent
,
Arnault
had
no
longer
*NL*
any
wit
,
Carnot
was
no
longer
honest
,
Soult
had
won
no
battles
;
it
is
*NL*
true
that
Napoleon
had
no
longer
any
genius
.
No
one
is
ignorant
of
the
*NL*
fact
that
letters
sent
to
an
exile
by
post
very
rarely
reached
him
,
as
*NL*
the
police
made
it
their
religious
duty
to
intercept
them
.
This
is
no
*NL*
new
fact
;
Descartes
complained
of
it
in
his
exile
.
Now
David
,
having
,
in
*NL*
a
Belgian
publication
,
shown
some
displeasure
at
not
receiving
letters
*NL*
which
had
been
written
to
him
,
it
struck
the
royalist
journals
as
*NL*
amusing
;
and
they
derided
the
prescribed
man
well
on
this
occasion
.
What
*NL*
separated
two
men
more
than
an
abyss
was
to
say
,
the
regicides
,
or
*NL*
to
say
the
voters
;
to
say
the
enemies
,
or
to
say
the
allies
;
to
say
*NL*
Napoleon
,
or
to
say
Buonaparte
.
All
sensible
people
were
agreed
that
the

CHAPTER
II
--
A
DOUBLE
QUARTETTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
These
Parisians
came
,
one
from
Toulouse
,
another
from
Limoges
,
the
third
*NL*
from
Cahors
,
and
the
fourth
from
Montauban
;
but
they
were
students
;
and
*NL*
when
one
says
student
,
one
says
Parisian
:
to
study
in
Paris
is
to
be
*NL*
born
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
young
men
were
insignificant
;
every
one
has
seen
such
faces
;
four
*NL*
specimens
of
humanity
taken
at
random
;
neither
good
nor
bad
,
neither
*NL*
wise
nor
ignorant
,
neither
geniuses
nor
fools
;
handsome
,
with
that
*NL*
charming
April
which
is
called
twenty
years
.
They
were
four
Oscars
;
for
,
*NL*
at
that
epoch
,
Arthurs
did
not
yet
exist
.
Burn
for
him
the
perfumes
of
*NL*
Araby
!
exclaimed
romance
.
Oscar
advances
.
Oscar
,
I
shall
behold
him
!
*NL*
People
had
just
emerged
from
Ossian
;
elegance
was
Scandinavian
and
*NL*
Caledonian
;
the
pure
English
style
was
only
to
prevail
later
,
and
*NL*
the
first
of
the
Arthurs
,
Wellington
,
had
but
just
won
the
battle
of
*NL*
Waterloo
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
Oscars
bore
the
names
,
one
of
Felix
Tholomyes
,
of
Toulouse
;
the
*NL*
second
,
Listolier
,
of
Cahors
;
the
next
,
Fameuil
,
of
Limoges
;
the
last
,
*NL*
Blachevelle
,
of
Montauban
.
Naturally
,
each
of
them
had
his
mistress
.
*NL*
Blachevelle
loved
Favourite
,
so
named
because
she
had
been
in
England
;
*NL*
Listolier
adored
Dahlia
,
who
had
taken
for
her
nickname
the
name
of
a
*NL*
flower
;
Fameuil
idolized
Zephine
,
an
abridgment
of
Josephine
;
Tholomyes
*NL*
had
Fantine
,
called
the
Blonde
,
because
of
her
beautiful
,
sunny
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
,
Dahlia
,
Zephine
,
and
Fantine
were
four
ravishing
young
women
,
*NL*
perfumed
and
radiant
,
still
a
little
like
working-women
,
and
not
yet
*NL*
entirely
divorced
from
their
needles
;
somewhat
disturbed
by
intrigues
,
*NL*
but
still
retaining
on
their
faces
something
of
the
serenity
of
toil
,
*NL*
and
in
their
souls
that
flower
of
honesty
which
survives
the
first
fall
*NL*
in
woman
.
One
of
the
four
was
called
the
young
,
because
she
was
*NL*
the
youngest
of
them
,
and
one
was
called
the
old
;
the
old
one
was
*NL*
twenty-three
.
Not
to
conceal
anything
,
the
three
first
were
more
*NL*
experienced
,
more
heedless
,
and
more
emancipated
into
the
tumult
of
life
*NL*
than
Fantine
the
Blonde
,
who
was
still
in
her
first
illusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dahlia
,
Zephine
,
and
especially
Favourite
,
could
not
have
said
as
much
.
*NL*
There
had
already
been
more
than
one
episode
in
their
romance
,
though
*NL*
hardly
begun
;
and
the
lover
who
had
borne
the
name
of
Adolph
in
the
*NL*
first
chapter
had
turned
out
to
be
Alphonse
in
the
second
,
and
Gustave
*NL*
in
the
third
.
Poverty
and
coquetry
are
two
fatal
counsellors
;
one
scolds
*NL*
and
the
other
flatters
,
and
the
beautiful
daughters
of
the
people
have
*NL*
both
of
them
whispering
in
their
ear
,
each
on
its
own
side
.
These
badly
*NL*
guarded
souls
listen
.
Hence
the
falls
which
they
accomplish
,
and
the
*NL*
stones
which
are
thrown
at
them
.
They
are
overwhelmed
with
splendor
of
*NL*
all
that
is
immaculate
and
inaccessible
.
Alas
!
what
if
the
Jungfrau
were
*NL*
hungry
?
*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
having
been
in
England
,
was
admired
by
Dahlia
and
Zephine
.
She
*NL*
had
had
an
establishment
of
her
own
very
early
in
life
.
Her
father
was
*NL*
an
old
unmarried
professor
of
mathematics
,
a
brutal
man
and
a
braggart
,
*NL*
who
went
out
to
give
lessons
in
spite
of
his
age
.
This
professor
,
when
*NL*
he
was
a
young
man
,
had
one
day
seen
a
chambermaid
's
gown
catch
on
*NL*
a
fender
;
he
had
fallen
in
love
in
consequence
of
this
accident
.
The
*NL*
result
had
been
Favourite
.
She
met
her
father
from
time
to
time
,
and
he
*NL*
bowed
to
her
.
One
morning
an
old
woman
with
the
air
of
a
devotee
,
*NL*
had
entered
her
apartments
,
and
had
said
to
her
,
``
You
do
not
know
me
,
*NL*
Mamemoiselle
?
''
``
No
.
''
``
I
am
your
mother
.
''
Then
the
old
woman
opened
the
*NL*
sideboard
,
and
ate
and
drank
,
had
a
mattress
which
she
owned
brought
in
,
*NL*
and
installed
herself
.
This
cross
and
pious
old
mother
never
spoke
to
*NL*
Favourite
,
remained
hours
without
uttering
a
word
,
breakfasted
,
dined
,
*NL*
and
supped
for
four
,
and
went
down
to
the
porter
's
quarters
for
company
,
*NL*
where
she
spoke
ill
of
her
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
having
rosy
nails
that
were
too
pretty
which
had
drawn
Dahlia
to
*NL*
Listolier
,
to
others
perhaps
,
to
idleness
.
How
could
she
make
such
nails
*NL*
work
?
She
who
wishes
to
remain
virtuous
must
not
have
pity
on
her
hands
.
*NL*
As
for
Zephine
,
she
had
conquered
Fameuil
by
her
roguish
and
caressing
*NL*
little
way
of
saying
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
men
were
comrades
;
the
young
girls
were
friends
.
Such
loves
*NL*
are
always
accompanied
by
such
friendships
.
*NL*
*NL*
Goodness
and
philosophy
are
two
distinct
things
;
the
proof
of
this
*NL*
is
that
,
after
making
all
due
allowances
for
these
little
irregular
*NL*
households
,
Favourite
,
Zephine
,
and
Dahlia
were
philosophical
young
*NL*
women
,
while
Fantine
was
a
good
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
!
some
one
will
exclaim
;
and
Tholomyes
?
Solomon
would
reply
that
*NL*
love
forms
a
part
of
wisdom
.
We
will
confine
ourselves
to
saying
that
*NL*
the
love
of
Fantine
was
a
first
love
,
a
sole
love
,
a
faithful
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
alone
,
of
all
the
four
,
was
not
called
``
thou
''
by
a
single
one
of
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
was
one
of
those
beings
who
blossom
,
so
to
speak
,
from
the
dregs
*NL*
of
the
people
.
Though
she
had
emerged
from
the
most
unfathomable
depths
*NL*
of
social
shadow
,
she
bore
on
her
brow
the
sign
of
the
anonymous
and
the
*NL*
unknown
.
She
was
born
at
M.
sur
M.
Of
what
parents
?
Who
can
say
?
She
had
*NL*
never
known
father
or
mother
.
She
was
called
Fantine
.
Why
Fantine
?
She
*NL*
had
never
borne
any
other
name
.
At
the
epoch
of
her
birth
the
Directory
*NL*
still
existed
.
She
had
no
family
name
;
she
had
no
family
;
no
baptismal
*NL*
name
;
the
Church
no
longer
existed
.
She
bore
the
name
which
pleased
*NL*
the
first
random
passer-by
,
who
had
encountered
her
,
when
a
very
small
*NL*
child
,
running
bare-legged
in
the
street
.
She
received
the
name
as
she
*NL*
received
the
water
from
the
clouds
upon
her
brow
when
it
rained
.
She
was
*NL*
called
little
Fantine
.
No
one
knew
more
than
that
.
This
human
creature
*NL*
had
entered
life
in
just
this
way
.
At
the
age
of
ten
,
Fantine
quitted
*NL*
the
town
and
went
to
service
with
some
farmers
in
the
neighborhood
.
At
*NL*
fifteen
she
came
to
Paris
``
to
seek
her
fortune
.
''
Fantine
was
beautiful
,
*NL*
and
remained
pure
as
long
as
she
could
.
She
was
a
lovely
blonde
,
with
*NL*
fine
teeth
.
She
had
gold
and
pearls
for
her
dowry
;
but
her
gold
was
on
*NL*
her
head
,
and
her
pearls
were
in
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
worked
for
her
living
;
then
,
still
for
the
sake
of
her
living
,
--
for
*NL*
the
heart
,
also
,
has
its
hunger
,
--
she
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
loved
Tholomyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
amour
for
him
;
passion
for
her
.
The
streets
of
the
Latin
quarter
,
*NL*
filled
with
throngs
of
students
and
grisettes
,
saw
the
beginning
of
*NL*
their
dream
.
Fantine
had
long
evaded
Tholomyes
in
the
mazes
of
the
hill
*NL*
of
the
Pantheon
,
where
so
many
adventurers
twine
and
untwine
,
but
in
*NL*
such
a
way
as
constantly
to
encounter
him
again
.
There
is
a
way
of
*NL*
avoiding
which
resembles
seeking
.
In
short
,
the
eclogue
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blachevelle
,
Listolier
,
and
Fameuil
formed
a
sort
of
group
of
which
*NL*
Tholomyes
was
the
head
.
It
was
he
who
possessed
the
wit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tholomyes
was
the
antique
old
student
;
he
was
rich
;
he
had
an
income
of
*NL*
four
thousand
francs
;
four
thousand
francs
!
a
splendid
scandal
on
*NL*
Mount
Sainte-Genevieve
.
Tholomyes
was
a
fast
man
of
thirty
,
and
badly
*NL*
preserved
.
He
was
wrinkled
and
toothless
,
and
he
had
the
beginning
of
a
*NL*
bald
spot
,
of
which
he
himself
said
with
sadness
,
the
skull
at
thirty
,
*NL*
the
knee
at
forty
.
His
digestion
was
mediocre
,
and
he
had
been
attacked
*NL*
by
a
watering
in
one
eye
.
But
in
proportion
as
his
youth
disappeared
,
*NL*
gayety
was
kindled
;
he
replaced
his
teeth
with
buffooneries
,
his
hair
*NL*
with
mirth
,
his
health
with
irony
,
his
weeping
eye
laughed
incessantly
.
*NL*
He
was
dilapidated
but
still
in
flower
.
His
youth
,
which
was
packing
*NL*
up
for
departure
long
before
its
time
,
beat
a
retreat
in
good
order
,
*NL*
bursting
with
laughter
,
and
no
one
saw
anything
but
fire
.
He
had
had
a
*NL*
piece
rejected
at
the
Vaudeville
.
He
made
a
few
verses
now
and
then
.
In
*NL*
addition
to
this
he
doubted
everything
to
the
last
degree
,
which
is
a
*NL*
vast
force
in
the
eyes
of
the
weak
.
Being
thus
ironical
and
bald
,
he
*NL*
was
the
leader
.
Iron
is
an
English
word
.
Is
it
possible
that
irony
is
*NL*
derived
from
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Tholomyes
took
the
three
others
aside
,
with
the
gesture
of
an
*NL*
oracle
,
and
said
to
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fantine
,
Dahlia
,
Zephine
,
and
Favourite
have
been
teasing
us
for
nearly
*NL*
a
year
to
give
them
a
surprise
.
We
have
promised
them
solemnly
that
we
*NL*
would
.
They
are
forever
talking
about
it
to
us
,
to
me
in
particular
,
*NL*
just
as
the
old
women
in
Naples
cry
to
Saint
Januarius
,
`
Faccia
*NL*
gialluta
,
fa
o
miracolo
,
Yellow
face
,
perform
thy
miracle
,
'
so
our
*NL*
beauties
say
to
me
incessantly
,
`
Tholomyes
,
when
will
you
bring
forth
*NL*
your
surprise
?
'
At
the
same
time
our
parents
keep
writing
to
us
.
*NL*
Pressure
on
both
sides
.
The
moment
has
arrived
,
it
seems
to
me
;
let
us
*NL*
discuss
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
,
Tholomyes
lowered
his
voice
and
articulated
something
so
*NL*
mirthful
,
that
a
vast
and
enthusiastic
grin
broke
out
upon
the
four
*NL*
mouths
simultaneously
,
and
Blachevelle
exclaimed
,
``
That
is
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
smoky
tap-room
presented
itself
;
they
entered
,
and
the
remainder
of
*NL*
their
confidential
colloquy
was
lost
in
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
of
these
shades
was
a
dazzling
pleasure
party
which
took
*NL*
place
on
the
following
Sunday
,
the
four
young
men
inviting
the
four
*NL*
young
girls
.

CHAPTER
III
--
FOUR
AND
FOUR
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
hard
nowadays
to
picture
to
one
's
self
what
a
pleasure-trip
of
*NL*
students
and
grisettes
to
the
country
was
like
,
forty-five
years
ago
.
*NL*
The
suburbs
of
Paris
are
no
longer
the
same
;
the
physiognomy
of
what
*NL*
may
be
called
circumparisian
life
has
changed
completely
in
the
last
*NL*
half-century
;
where
there
was
the
cuckoo
,
there
is
the
railway
car
;
*NL*
where
there
was
a
tender-boat
,
there
is
now
the
steamboat
;
people
speak
*NL*
of
Fecamp
nowadays
as
they
spoke
of
Saint-Cloud
in
those
days
.
The
Paris
*NL*
of
1862
is
a
city
which
has
France
for
its
outskirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
couples
conscientiously
went
through
with
all
the
country
*NL*
follies
possible
at
that
time
.
The
vacation
was
beginning
,
and
it
was
a
*NL*
warm
,
bright
,
summer
day
.
On
the
preceding
day
,
Favourite
,
the
only
one
*NL*
who
knew
how
to
write
,
had
written
the
following
to
Tholomyes
in
the
*NL*
name
of
the
four
:
``
It
is
a
good
hour
to
emerge
from
happiness
.
''
That
*NL*
is
why
they
rose
at
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
Then
they
went
to
*NL*
Saint-Cloud
by
the
coach
,
looked
at
the
dry
cascade
and
exclaimed
,
``
This
*NL*
must
be
very
beautiful
when
there
is
water
!
''
They
breakfasted
at
the
*NL*
Tete-Noir
,
where
Castaing
had
not
yet
been
;
they
treated
themselves
to
a
*NL*
game
of
ring-throwing
under
the
quincunx
of
trees
of
the
grand
fountain
;
*NL*
they
ascended
Diogenes
'
lantern
,
they
gambled
for
macaroons
at
the
*NL*
roulette
establishment
of
the
Pont
de
Sevres
,
picked
bouquets
at
*NL*
Pateaux
,
bought
reed-pipes
at
Neuilly
,
ate
apple
tarts
everywhere
,
and
*NL*
were
perfectly
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girls
rustled
and
chatted
like
warblers
escaped
from
their
*NL*
cage
.
It
was
a
perfect
delirium
.
From
time
to
time
they
bestowed
little
*NL*
taps
on
the
young
men
.
Matutinal
intoxication
of
life
!
adorable
years
!
*NL*
the
wings
of
the
dragonfly
quiver
.
Oh
,
whoever
you
may
be
,
do
you
not
*NL*
remember
?
Have
you
rambled
through
the
brushwood
,
holding
aside
the
*NL*
branches
,
on
account
of
the
charming
head
which
is
coming
on
behind
you
?
*NL*
Have
you
slid
,
laughing
,
down
a
slope
all
wet
with
rain
,
with
a
beloved
*NL*
woman
holding
your
hand
,
and
crying
,
``
Ah
,
my
new
boots
!
what
a
state
*NL*
they
are
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
at
once
that
that
merry
obstacle
,
a
shower
,
was
lacking
in
*NL*
the
case
of
this
good-humored
party
,
although
Favourite
had
said
as
they
*NL*
set
out
,
with
a
magisterial
and
maternal
tone
,
``
The
slugs
are
crawling
*NL*
in
the
paths
,
--
a
sign
of
rain
,
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
four
were
madly
pretty
.
A
good
old
classic
poet
,
then
famous
,
a
good
*NL*
fellow
who
had
an
Eleonore
,
M.
le
Chevalier
de
Labouisse
,
as
he
strolled
*NL*
that
day
beneath
the
chestnut-trees
of
Saint-Cloud
,
saw
them
pass
about
*NL*
ten
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
There
is
one
too
many
of
*NL*
them
,
''
as
he
thought
of
the
Graces
.
Favourite
,
Blachevelle
's
friend
,
the
*NL*
one
aged
three
and
twenty
,
the
old
one
,
ran
on
in
front
under
the
great
*NL*
green
boughs
,
jumped
the
ditches
,
stalked
distractedly
over
bushes
,
and
*NL*
presided
over
this
merry-making
with
the
spirit
of
a
young
female
faun
.
*NL*
Zephine
and
Dahlia
,
whom
chance
had
made
beautiful
in
such
a
way
that
*NL*
they
set
each
off
when
they
were
together
,
and
completed
each
other
,
*NL*
never
left
each
other
,
more
from
an
instinct
of
coquetry
than
from
*NL*
friendship
,
and
clinging
to
each
other
,
they
assumed
English
poses
;
the
*NL*
first
keepsakes
had
just
made
their
appearance
,
melancholy
was
dawning
*NL*
for
women
,
as
later
on
,
Byronism
dawned
for
men
;
and
the
hair
of
the
*NL*
tender
sex
began
to
droop
dolefully
.
Zephine
and
Dahlia
had
their
hair
*NL*
dressed
in
rolls
.
Listolier
and
Fameuil
,
who
were
engaged
in
discussing
*NL*
their
professors
,
explained
to
Fantine
the
difference
that
existed
*NL*
between
M.
Delvincourt
and
M.
Blondeau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blachevelle
seemed
to
have
been
created
expressly
to
carry
Favourite
's
*NL*
single-bordered
,
imitation
India
shawl
of
Ternaux
's
manufacture
,
on
his
*NL*
arm
on
Sundays
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tholomyes
followed
,
dominating
the
group
.
He
was
very
gay
,
but
one
felt
*NL*
the
force
of
government
in
him
;
there
was
dictation
in
his
joviality
;
*NL*
his
principal
ornament
was
a
pair
of
trousers
of
elephant-leg
pattern
of
*NL*
nankeen
,
with
straps
of
braided
copper
wire
;
he
carried
a
stout
rattan
*NL*
worth
two
hundred
francs
in
his
hand
,
and
,
as
he
treated
himself
to
*NL*
everything
,
a
strange
thing
called
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
.
Nothing
was
*NL*
sacred
to
him
;
he
smoked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Tholomyes
is
astounding
!
''
said
the
others
,
with
veneration
.
``
What
*NL*
trousers
!
What
energy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Fantine
,
she
was
a
joy
to
behold
.
Her
splendid
teeth
had
*NL*
evidently
received
an
office
from
God
,
--
laughter
.
She
preferred
to
carry
*NL*
her
little
hat
of
sewed
straw
,
with
its
long
white
strings
,
in
her
hand
*NL*
rather
than
on
her
head
.
Her
thick
blond
hair
,
which
was
inclined
to
*NL*
wave
,
and
which
easily
uncoiled
,
and
which
it
was
necessary
to
fasten
*NL*
up
incessantly
,
seemed
made
for
the
flight
of
Galatea
under
the
*NL*
willows
.
Her
rosy
lips
babbled
enchantingly
.
The
corners
of
her
mouth
*NL*
voluptuously
turned
up
,
as
in
the
antique
masks
of
Erigone
,
had
an
*NL*
air
of
encouraging
the
audacious
;
but
her
long
,
shadowy
lashes
drooped
*NL*
discreetly
over
the
jollity
of
the
lower
part
of
the
face
as
though
to
*NL*
call
a
halt
.
There
was
something
indescribably
harmonious
and
striking
*NL*
about
her
entire
dress
.
She
wore
a
gown
of
mauve
barege
,
little
reddish
*NL*
brown
buskins
,
whose
ribbons
traced
an
X
on
her
fine
,
white
,
open-worked
*NL*
stockings
,
and
that
sort
of
muslin
spencer
,
a
Marseilles
invention
,
*NL*
whose
name
,
canezou
,
a
corruption
of
the
words
quinze
aout
,
pronounced
*NL*
after
the
fashion
of
the
Canebiere
,
signifies
fine
weather
,
heat
,
and
*NL*
midday
.
The
three
others
,
less
timid
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
*NL*
wore
low-necked
dresses
without
disguise
,
which
in
summer
,
beneath
*NL*
flower-adorned
hats
,
are
very
graceful
and
enticing
;
but
by
the
side
*NL*
of
these
audacious
outfits
,
blond
Fantine
's
canezou
,
with
its
*NL*
transparencies
,
its
indiscretion
,
and
its
reticence
,
concealing
and
*NL*
displaying
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
seemed
an
alluring
godsend
of
*NL*
decency
,
and
the
famous
Court
of
Love
,
presided
over
by
the
Vicomtesse
*NL*
de
Cette
,
with
the
sea-green
eyes
,
would
,
perhaps
,
have
awarded
the
*NL*
prize
for
coquetry
to
this
canezou
,
in
the
contest
for
the
prize
of
*NL*
modesty
.
The
most
ingenious
is
,
at
times
,
the
wisest
.
This
does
happen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brilliant
of
face
,
delicate
of
profile
,
with
eyes
of
a
deep
blue
,
heavy
*NL*
lids
,
feet
arched
and
small
,
wrists
and
ankles
admirably
formed
,
a
white
*NL*
skin
which
,
here
and
there
allowed
the
azure
branching
of
the
veins
to
*NL*
be
seen
,
joy
,
a
cheek
that
was
young
and
fresh
,
the
robust
throat
of
the
*NL*
Juno
of
AEgina
,
a
strong
and
supple
nape
of
the
neck
,
shoulders
modelled
*NL*
as
though
by
Coustou
,
with
a
voluptuous
dimple
in
the
middle
,
visible
*NL*
through
the
muslin
;
a
gayety
cooled
by
dreaminess
;
sculptural
and
*NL*
exquisite
--
such
was
Fantine
;
and
beneath
these
feminine
adornments
and
*NL*
these
ribbons
one
could
divine
a
statue
,
and
in
that
statue
a
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
was
beautiful
,
without
being
too
conscious
of
it
.
Those
rare
*NL*
dreamers
,
mysterious
priests
of
the
beautiful
who
silently
confront
*NL*
everything
with
perfection
,
would
have
caught
a
glimpse
in
this
little
*NL*
working-woman
,
through
the
transparency
of
her
Parisian
grace
,
of
the
*NL*
ancient
sacred
euphony
.
This
daughter
of
the
shadows
was
thoroughbred
.
*NL*
She
was
beautiful
in
the
two
ways
--
style
and
rhythm
.
Style
is
the
form
*NL*
of
the
ideal
;
rhythm
is
its
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
said
that
Fantine
was
joy
;
she
was
also
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
an
observer
who
studied
her
attentively
,
that
which
breathed
from
*NL*
her
athwart
all
the
intoxication
of
her
age
,
the
season
,
and
her
*NL*
love
affair
,
was
an
invincible
expression
of
reserve
and
modesty
.
She
*NL*
remained
a
little
astonished
.
This
chaste
astonishment
is
the
shade
*NL*
of
difference
which
separates
Psyche
from
Venus
.
Fantine
had
the
long
,
*NL*
white
,
fine
fingers
of
the
vestal
virgin
who
stirs
the
ashes
of
the
*NL*
sacred
fire
with
a
golden
pin
.
Although
she
would
have
refused
nothing
*NL*
to
Tholomyes
,
as
we
shall
have
more
than
ample
opportunity
to
see
,
her
*NL*
face
in
repose
was
supremely
virginal
;
a
sort
of
serious
and
almost
*NL*
austere
dignity
suddenly
overwhelmed
her
at
certain
times
,
and
there
*NL*
was
nothing
more
singular
and
disturbing
than
to
see
gayety
become
so
*NL*
suddenly
extinct
there
,
and
meditation
succeed
to
cheerfulness
without
*NL*
any
transition
state
.
This
sudden
and
sometimes
severely
accentuated
*NL*
gravity
resembled
the
disdain
of
a
goddess
.
Her
brow
,
her
nose
,
her
*NL*
chin
,
presented
that
equilibrium
of
outline
which
is
quite
distinct
*NL*
from
equilibrium
of
proportion
,
and
from
which
harmony
of
countenance
*NL*
results
;
in
the
very
characteristic
interval
which
separates
the
base
*NL*
of
the
nose
from
the
upper
lip
,
she
had
that
imperceptible
and
charming
*NL*
fold
,
a
mysterious
sign
of
chastity
,
which
makes
Barberousse
fall
in
*NL*
love
with
a
Diana
found
in
the
treasures
of
Iconia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Love
is
a
fault
;
so
be
it
.
Fantine
was
innocence
floating
high
over
*NL*
fault
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THOLOMYES
IS
SO
MERRY
THAT
HE
SINGS
A
SPANISH
DITTY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
was
composed
of
dawn
,
from
one
end
to
the
other
.
All
nature
*NL*
seemed
to
be
having
a
holiday
,
and
to
be
laughing
.
The
flower-beds
of
*NL*
Saint-Cloud
perfumed
the
air
;
the
breath
of
the
Seine
rustled
the
*NL*
leaves
vaguely
;
the
branches
gesticulated
in
the
wind
,
bees
pillaged
the
*NL*
jasmines
;
a
whole
bohemia
of
butterflies
swooped
down
upon
the
yarrow
,
*NL*
the
clover
,
and
the
sterile
oats
;
in
the
august
park
of
the
King
of
*NL*
France
there
was
a
pack
of
vagabonds
,
the
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
merry
couples
,
mingled
with
the
sun
,
the
fields
,
the
flowers
,
*NL*
the
trees
,
were
resplendent
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
this
community
of
Paradise
,
talking
,
singing
,
running
,
dancing
,
*NL*
chasing
butterflies
,
plucking
convolvulus
,
wetting
their
pink
,
open-work
*NL*
stockings
in
the
tall
grass
,
fresh
,
wild
,
without
malice
,
all
received
,
*NL*
to
some
extent
,
the
kisses
of
all
,
with
the
exception
of
Fantine
,
*NL*
who
was
hedged
about
with
that
vague
resistance
of
hers
composed
of
*NL*
dreaminess
and
wildness
,
and
who
was
in
love
.
``
You
always
have
a
queer
*NL*
look
about
you
,
''
said
Favourite
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
things
are
joys
.
These
passages
of
happy
couples
are
a
profound
*NL*
appeal
to
life
and
nature
,
and
make
a
caress
and
light
spring
forth
from
*NL*
everything
.
There
was
once
a
fairy
who
created
the
fields
and
forests
*NL*
expressly
for
those
in
love
,
--
in
that
eternal
hedge-school
of
lovers
,
*NL*
which
is
forever
beginning
anew
,
and
which
will
last
as
long
as
there
*NL*
are
hedges
and
scholars
.
Hence
the
popularity
of
spring
among
thinkers
.
*NL*
The
patrician
and
the
knife-grinder
,
the
duke
and
the
peer
,
the
limb
*NL*
of
the
law
,
the
courtiers
and
townspeople
,
as
they
used
to
say
in
olden
*NL*
times
,
all
are
subjects
of
this
fairy
.
They
laugh
and
hunt
,
and
there
*NL*
is
in
the
air
the
brilliance
of
an
apotheosis
--
what
a
transfiguration
*NL*
effected
by
love
!
Notaries
'
clerks
are
gods
.
And
the
little
cries
,
*NL*
the
pursuits
through
the
grass
,
the
waists
embraced
on
the
fly
,
those
*NL*
jargons
which
are
melodies
,
those
adorations
which
burst
forth
in
the
*NL*
manner
of
pronouncing
a
syllable
,
those
cherries
torn
from
one
mouth
by
*NL*
another
,
--
all
this
blazes
forth
and
takes
its
place
among
the
celestial
*NL*
glories
.
Beautiful
women
waste
themselves
sweetly
.
They
think
that
this
*NL*
will
never
come
to
an
end
.
Philosophers
,
poets
,
painters
,
observe
these
*NL*
ecstasies
and
know
not
what
to
make
of
it
,
so
greatly
are
they
dazzled
*NL*
by
it
.
The
departure
for
Cythera
!
exclaims
Watteau
;
Lancret
,
the
painter
*NL*
of
plebeians
,
contemplates
his
bourgeois
,
who
have
flitted
away
into
the
*NL*
azure
sky
;
Diderot
stretches
out
his
arms
to
all
these
love
idyls
,
and
*NL*
d'Urfe
mingles
druids
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
the
four
couples
went
to
what
was
then
called
the
King
's
*NL*
Square
to
see
a
newly
arrived
plant
from
India
,
whose
name
escapes
our
*NL*
memory
at
this
moment
,
and
which
,
at
that
epoch
,
was
attracting
all
*NL*
Paris
to
Saint-Cloud
.
It
was
an
odd
and
charming
shrub
with
a
long
stem
,
*NL*
whose
numerous
branches
,
bristling
and
leafless
and
as
fine
as
threads
,
*NL*
were
covered
with
a
million
tiny
white
rosettes
;
this
gave
the
shrub
the
*NL*
air
of
a
head
of
hair
studded
with
flowers
.
There
was
always
an
admiring
*NL*
crowd
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
viewing
the
shrub
,
Tholomyes
exclaimed
,
``
I
offer
you
asses
!
''
and
*NL*
having
agreed
upon
a
price
with
the
owner
of
the
asses
,
they
returned
*NL*
by
way
of
Vanvres
and
Issy
.
At
Issy
an
incident
occurred
.
The
truly
*NL*
national
park
,
at
that
time
owned
by
Bourguin
the
contractor
,
happened
*NL*
to
be
wide
open
.
They
passed
the
gates
,
visited
the
manikin
anchorite
in
*NL*
his
grotto
,
tried
the
mysterious
little
effects
of
the
famous
cabinet
*NL*
of
mirrors
,
the
wanton
trap
worthy
of
a
satyr
become
a
millionaire
or
of
*NL*
Turcaret
metamorphosed
into
a
Priapus
.
They
had
stoutly
shaken
the
swing
*NL*
attached
to
the
two
chestnut-trees
celebrated
by
the
Abbe
de
Bernis
.
*NL*
As
he
swung
these
beauties
,
one
after
the
other
,
producing
folds
in
the
*NL*
fluttering
skirts
which
Greuze
would
have
found
to
his
taste
,
amid
peals
*NL*
of
laughter
,
the
Toulousan
Tholomyes
,
who
was
somewhat
of
a
Spaniard
,
*NL*
Toulouse
being
the
cousin
of
Tolosa
,
sang
,
to
a
melancholy
chant
,
the
*NL*
old
ballad
gallega
,
probably
inspired
by
some
lovely
maid
dashing
in
*NL*
full
flight
upon
a
rope
between
two
trees
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soy
de
Badajoz
,
``
Badajoz
is
my
home
,
*NL*
Amor
me
llama
,
And
Love
is
my
name
;
*NL*
Toda
mi
alma
,
To
my
eyes
in
flame
,
*NL*
Es
en
mi
ojos
,
All
my
soul
doth
come
;
*NL*
Porque
ensenas
,
For
instruction
meet
*NL*
A
tuas
piernas
.
I
receive
at
thy
feet
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
alone
refused
to
swing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
to
have
people
put
on
airs
like
that
,
''
muttered
Favourite
,
*NL*
with
a
good
deal
of
acrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
the
asses
there
was
a
fresh
delight
;
they
crossed
the
*NL*
Seine
in
a
boat
,
and
proceeding
from
Passy
on
foot
they
reached
the
*NL*
barrier
of
l'Etoile
.
They
had
been
up
since
five
o'clock
that
morning
,
*NL*
as
the
reader
will
remember
;
but
bah
!
there
is
no
such
thing
as
fatigue
*NL*
on
Sunday
,
said
Favourite
;
on
Sunday
fatigue
does
not
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
three
o'clock
the
four
couples
,
frightened
at
their
happiness
,
*NL*
were
sliding
down
the
Russian
mountains
,
a
singular
edifice

CHAPTER
V
--
AT
BOMBARDA
'S
*NL*
*NL*
The
Russian
mountains
having
been
exhausted
,
they
began
to
think
about
*NL*
dinner
;
and
the
radiant
party
of
eight
,
somewhat
weary
at
last
,
became
*NL*
stranded
in
Bombarda
's
public
house
,
a
branch
establishment
which
had
*NL*
been
set
up
in
the
Champs-Elysees
by
that
famous
restaurant-keeper
,
*NL*
Bombarda
,
whose
sign
could
then
be
seen
in
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
near
*NL*
Delorme
Alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
but
ugly
room
,
with
an
alcove
and
a
bed
at
the
end
-LRB-
they
had
*NL*
been
obliged
to
put
up
with
this
accommodation
in
view
of
the
Sunday
*NL*
crowd
-RRB-
;
two
windows
whence
they
could
survey
beyond
the
elms
,
the
quay
*NL*
and
the
river
;
a
magnificent
August
sunlight
lightly
touching
the
panes
;
*NL*
two
tables
;
upon
one
of
them
a
triumphant
mountain
of
bouquets
,
mingled
*NL*
with
the
hats
of
men
and
women
;
at
the
other
the
four
couples
seated
*NL*
round
a
merry
confusion
of
platters
,
dishes
,
glasses
,
and
bottles
;
jugs
*NL*
of
beer
mingled
with
flasks
of
wine
;
very
little
order
on
the
table
,
*NL*
some
disorder
beneath
it
;
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
made
beneath
the
table
*NL*
A
noise
,
a
clatter
of
the
feet
that
was
abominable
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
says
Moliere
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
state
which
the
shepherd
idyl
,
begun
at
five
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
had
reached
at
half-past
four
in
the
afternoon
.
The
sun
was
*NL*
setting
;
their
appetites
were
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Champs-Elysees
,
filled
with
sunshine
and
with
people
,
were
nothing
*NL*
but
light
and
dust
,
the
two
things
of
which
glory
is
composed
.
The
*NL*
horses
of
Marly
,
those
neighing
marbles
,
were
prancing
in
a
cloud
*NL*
of
gold
.
Carriages
were
going
and
coming
.
A
squadron
of
magnificent
*NL*
body-guards
,
with
their
clarions
at
their
head
,
were
descending
the
*NL*
Avenue
de
Neuilly
;
the
white
flag
,
showing
faintly
rosy
in
the
setting
*NL*
sun
,
floated
over
the
dome
of
the
Tuileries
.
The
Place
de
la
Concorde
,
*NL*
which
had
become
the
Place
Louis
XV
.
once
more
,
was
choked
with
happy
*NL*
promenaders
.
Many
wore
the
silver
fleur-de-lys
suspended
from
the
*NL*
white-watered
ribbon
,
which
had
not
yet
wholly
disappeared
from
*NL*
button-holes
in
the
year
1817
.
Here
and
there
choruses
of
little
girls
*NL*
threw
to
the
winds
,
amid
the
passersby
,
who
formed
into
circles
and
*NL*
applauded
,
the
then
celebrated
Bourbon
air
,
which
was
destined
to
strike
*NL*
the
Hundred
Days
with
lightning
,
and
which
had
for
its
refrain
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rendez-nous
notre
pere
de
Gand
,
*NL*
Rendez-nous
notre
pere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
us
back
our
father
from
Ghent
,
*NL*
Give
us
back
our
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Groups
of
dwellers
in
the
suburbs
,
in
Sunday
array
,
sometimes
even
*NL*
decorated
with
the
fleur-de-lys
,
like
the
bourgeois
,
scattered
over
the
*NL*
large
square
and
the
Marigny
square
,
were
playing
at
rings
and
revolving
*NL*
on
the
wooden
horses
;
others
were
engaged
in
drinking
;
some
journeyman
*NL*
printers
had
on
paper
caps
;
their
laughter
was
audible
.
Every
thing
*NL*
was
radiant
.
It
was
a
time
of
undisputed
peace
and
profound
royalist
*NL*
security
;
it
was
the
epoch
when
a
special
and
private
report
of
Chief
*NL*
of
Police
Angeles
to
the
King
,
on
the
subject
of
the
suburbs
of
Paris
,
*NL*
terminated
with
these
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Taking
all
things
into
consideration
,
Sire
,
there
is
nothing
to
be
*NL*
feared
from
these
people
.
They
are
as
heedless
and
as
indolent
as
cats
.
*NL*
The
populace
is
restless
in
the
provinces
;
it
is
not
in
Paris
.
These
are
*NL*
very
pretty
men
,
Sire
.
It
would
take
all
of
two
of
them
to
make
one
*NL*
of
your
grenadiers
.
There
is
nothing
to
be
feared
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
populace
of
Paris
the
capital
.
It
is
remarkable
that
the
stature
of
*NL*
this
population
should
have
diminished
in
the
last
fifty
years
;
and
*NL*
the
populace
of
the
suburbs
is
still
more
puny
than
at
the
time
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
.
It
is
not
dangerous
.
In
short
,
it
is
an
amiable
rabble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Prefects
of
the
police
do
not
deem
it
possible
that
a
cat
can
transform
*NL*
itself
into
a
lion
;
that
does
happen
,
however
,
and
in
that
lies
the
*NL*
miracle
wrought
by
the
populace
of
Paris
.
Moreover
,
the
cat
so
despised
*NL*
by
Count
Angles
possessed
the
esteem
of
the
republics
of
old
.
In
their
*NL*
eyes
it
was
liberty
incarnate
;
and
as
though
to
serve
as
pendant
to
*NL*
the
Minerva
Aptera
of
the
Piraeus
,
there
stood
on
the
public
square
in
*NL*
Corinth
the
colossal
bronze
figure
of
a
cat
.
The
ingenuous
police
of
the
*NL*
Restoration
beheld
the
populace
of
Paris
in
too
``
rose-colored
''
a
light
;
*NL*
it
is
not
so
much
of
``
an
amiable
rabble
''
as
it
is
thought
.
The
Parisian
*NL*
is
to
the
Frenchman
what
the
Athenian
was
to
the
Greek
:
no
one
sleeps
*NL*
more
soundly
than
he
,
no
one
is
more
frankly
frivolous
and
lazy
than
*NL*
he
,
no
one
can
better
assume
the
air
of
forgetfulness
;
let
him
not
be
*NL*
trusted
nevertheless
;
he
is
ready
for
any
sort
of
cool
deed
;
but
when
*NL*
there
is
glory
at
the
end
of
it
,
he
is
worthy
of
admiration
in
every
*NL*
sort
of
fury
.
Give
him
a
pike
,
he
will
produce
the
10th
of
August
;
give
*NL*
him
a
gun
,
you
will
have
Austerlitz
.
He
is
Napoleon
's
stay
and
Danton
's
*NL*
resource
.
Is
it
a
question
of
country
,
he
enlists
;
is
it
a
question
of
*NL*
liberty
,
he
tears
up
the
pavements
.
Beware
!
his
hair
filled
with
wrath
,
*NL*
is
epic
;
his
blouse
drapes
itself
like
the
folds
of
a
chlamys
.
Take
*NL*
care
!
he
will
make
of
the
first
Rue
Grenetat
which
comes
to
hand
Caudine
*NL*
Forks
.
When
the
hour
strikes
,
this
man
of
the
faubourgs
will
grow
in
*NL*
stature
;
this
little
man
will
arise
,
and
his
gaze
will
be
terrible
,
and
*NL*
his
breath
will
become
a
tempest
,
and
there
will
issue
forth
from
that
*NL*
slender
chest
enough
wind
to
disarrange
the
folds
of
the
Alps
.
It
is
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
suburban
man
of
Paris
,
that
the
Revolution
,
mixed
with
*NL*
arms
,
conquers
Europe
.
He
sings
;
it
is
his
delight
.
Proportion
his
song
*NL*
to
his
nature
,
and
you
will
see
!
As
long
as
he
has
for
refrain
nothing
*NL*
but
la
Carmagnole
,
he
only
overthrows
Louis
XVI.
;
make
him
sing
the
*NL*
Marseillaise
,
and
he
will
free
the
world
.

This
note
jotted
down
on
the
margin
of
Angles
'
report
,
we
will
return
to
*NL*

four
couples

The
dinner
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
drawing
to
its
close

A
CHAPTER
IN
WHICH
THEY
ADORE
EACH
OTHER
*NL*
*NL*
Chat
at
table
,
the
chat
of
love
;
it
is
as
impossible
to
reproduce
one
as
*NL*
the
other
;
the
chat
of
love
is
a
cloud
;
the
chat
at
table
is
smoke

*NL*
*NL*
Fameuil
and
Dahlia
were
humming
.
Tholomyes
was
drinking
.
Zephine
was
*NL*
laughing
,
Fantine
smiling
,
Listolier
blowing
a
wooden
trumpet
which
he
*NL*
had
purchased
at
Saint-Cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
gazed
tenderly
at
Blachevelle
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blachevelle
,
I
adore
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
called
forth
a
question
from
Blachevelle
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
you
do
,
Favourite
,
if
I
were
to
cease
to
love
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
!
''
cried
Favourite
.
``
Ah
!
Do
not
say
that
even
in
jest
!
If
you
were
*NL*
to
cease
to
love
me
,
I
would
spring
after
you
,
I
would
scratch
you
,
*NL*
I
should
rend
you
,
I
would
throw
you
into
the
water
,
I
would
have
you
*NL*
arrested
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blachevelle
smiled
with
the
voluptuous
self-conceit
of
a
man
who
is
*NL*
tickled
in
his
self-love
.
Favourite
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
would
scream
to
the
police
!
Ah
!
I
should
not
restrain
myself
,
*NL*
not
at
all
!
Rabble
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blachevelle
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
in
an
ecstasy
,
and
closed
*NL*
both
eyes
proudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dahlia
,
as
she
ate
,
said
in
a
low
voice
to
Favourite
,
amid
the
uproar
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
really
idolize
him
deeply
,
that
Blachevelle
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
detest
him
,
''
replied
Favourite
in
the
same
tone
,
seizing
her
fork
*NL*
again
.
``
He
is
avaricious
.
I
love
the
little
fellow
opposite
me
in
my
*NL*
house
.
He
is
very
nice
,
that
young
man
;
do
you
know
him
?
One
can
see
*NL*
that
he
is
an
actor
by
profession
.
I
love
actors
.
As
soon
as
he
comes
*NL*
in
,
his
mother
says
to
him
:
`
Ah
!
mon
Dieu
!
my
peace
of
mind
is
gone
.
*NL*
There
he
goes
with
his
shouting
.
But
,
my
dear
,
you
are
splitting
my
*NL*
head
!
'
So
he
goes
up
to
rat-ridden
garrets
,
to
black
holes
,
as
high
as
*NL*
he
can
mount
,
and
there
he
sets
to
singing
,
declaiming
,
how
do
I
know
*NL*
what
?
so
that
he
can
be
heard
down
stairs
!
He
earns
twenty
sous
a
day
at
*NL*
an
attorney
's
by
penning
quibbles
.
He
is
the
son
of
a
former
precentor
*NL*
of
Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas
.
Ah
!
he
is
very
nice
.
He
idolizes
me
so
,
*NL*
that
one
day
when
he
saw
me
making
batter
for
some
pancakes
,
he
said
to
*NL*
me
:
`
Mamselle
,
make
your
gloves
into
fritters
,
and
I
will
eat
them
.
'
It
*NL*
is
only
artists
who
can
say
such
things
as
that
.
Ah
!
he
is
very
nice
.
*NL*
I
am
in
a
fair
way
to
go
out
of
my
head
over
that
little
fellow
.
Never
*NL*
mind
;
I
tell
Blachevelle
that
I
adore
him
--
how
I
lie
!
Hey
!
How
I
do
*NL*
lie
!

*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
paused
,
and
then
went
on
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sad

you

It
has
done
nothing

rain
all

the

wind
irritates
me
;
the
wind
does
not
abate

Blachevelle
is
very
stingy
;
*NL*
there
are
hardly
any
green
peas
in
the
market
;
one
does
not
know
what
to

eat

I
have
the
spleen
,
as
the
English
say

butter
is
so
dear

and
then
*NL*
you
see
it
is
horrible
,
here
we
are
dining
in
a
room
with
a
bed
in
it
,
*NL*

that
disgusts
me
with
life

THE
WISDOM

THOLOMYES

*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
while
some
sang
,
the
rest
talked
together
tumultuously
*NL*
all
at
once
;
it
was
no
longer
anything
but
noise
.
Tholomyes
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
not
talk
at
random
nor
too
fast

he
exclaimed

``
Let

reflect
,

if
we
wish
to
be

Too
much

empties
the

a
stupid
way

Running

gathers
no
froth

No

Let

mingle
majesty
with
the
feast

Let

eat
with
meditation
;
let

make
*NL*
haste
slowly

Let
us
not
hurry

Consider
the
springtime
;
if
it
makes
*NL*
haste
,
it
is
done
for
;
that
is
to
say
,
it
gets
frozen

Excess
of
zeal
*NL*
ruins
peach-trees
and
apricot-trees

Excess
of
zeal
kills
the
grace
and

the
mirth
of
good

No
zeal

*NL*
*NL*
A
hollow
sound
of
rebellion
rumbled
through
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
us
in
peace

Tholomyes
,
''
said
Blachevelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down

Fameuil

*NL*
``

cried
Listolier

*NL*
*NL*
``

resumed
Fameuil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
sober

added
Listolier

*NL*
``

remarked
Blachevelle

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
Marquis

that

retorted
Tholomyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mediocre
play
upon
words
produced
the
effect
of
a
stone
in
a
pool
.
*NL*
The
Marquis
de
Montcalm
was
at
that
time
a
celebrated
royalist
.
All
the
*NL*
frogs
held
their
peace

*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends

cried
Tholomyes
,
with
the
accent
of
a
man
who
had
recovered
*NL*
his
empire
,
``
Come
to
yourselves

This
pun
which
has
fallen
from
the
*NL*
skies
must
not
be
received
with
too
much
stupor
.
Everything
which
falls

in

way

not
necessarily
worthy

and
respect

The
pun
*NL*
is
the
dung

mind

soars

The
jest
falls

no

*NL*
and
the
mind
after
producing
a
piece
of
stupidity
plunges
into
the
azure

depths

A

speck
flattened
against
the
rock
does
not
prevent
the
*NL*
condor
from
soaring
aloft
.
Far
be
it
from
me
to
insult
the
pun
!
I
honor
*NL*
it
in
proportion
to
its
merits
;
nothing
more
.
All
the
most
august
,
the
*NL*
most
sublime
,
the
most
charming
of
humanity
,
and
perhaps
outside
of
*NL*
humanity
,
have
made
puns
.
Jesus
Christ
made
a
pun
on
St.
Peter
,
Moses
on
*NL*
Isaac
,
AEschylus
on
Polynices
,
Cleopatra
on
Octavius
.
And
observe
that
*NL*
Cleopatra
's
pun
preceded
the
battle
of
Actium
,
and
that
had
it
not
been
*NL*
for
it
,
no
one
would
have
remembered
the
city
of
Toryne
,
a
Greek
name
*NL*
which
signifies
a
ladle
.
That
once
conceded
,
I
return
to
my
exhortation
.
*NL*
I
repeat
,
brothers
,
I
repeat
,
no
zeal
,
no
hubbub
,
no
excess
;
even
in
*NL*
witticisms
,
gayety
,
jollities
,
or
plays
on
words
.
Listen
to
me
.
I
have
*NL*
the
prudence
of
Amphiaraus
and
the
baldness
of
Caesar
.
There
must
be
a
*NL*
limit
,
even
to
rebuses
.
Est
modus
in
rebus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
be
a
limit
,
even
to
dinners
.
You
are
fond
of
apple
*NL*
turnovers
,
ladies
;
do
not
indulge
in
them
to
excess
.
Even
in
the
matter
*NL*
of
turnovers
,
good
sense
and
art
are
requisite
.
Gluttony
chastises
the
*NL*
glutton
,
Gula
punit
Gulax
.
Indigestion
is
charged
by
the
good
God
with
*NL*
preaching
morality
to
stomachs
.
And
remember
this
:
each
one
of
our
*NL*
passions
,
even
love
,
has
a
stomach
which
must
not
be
filled
too
full
.
In
*NL*
all
things
the
word
finis
must
be
written
in
good
season
;
self-control
*NL*
must
be
exercised
when
the
matter
becomes
urgent
;
the
bolt
must
be
drawn
*NL*
on
appetite
;
one
must
set
one
's
own
fantasy
to
the
violin
,
and
carry
*NL*
one
's
self
to
the
post
.
The
sage
is
the
man
who
knows
how
,
at
a
given
*NL*
moment
,
to
effect
his
own
arrest
.
Have
some
confidence
in
me
,
for
I
*NL*
have
succeeded
to
some
extent
in
my
study
of
the
law
,
according
to
*NL*
the
verdict
of
my
examinations
,
for
I
know
the
difference
between
the
*NL*
question
put
and
the
question
pending
,
for
I
have
sustained
a
thesis
in
*NL*
Latin
upon
the
manner
in
which
torture
was
administered
at
Rome
at
the
*NL*
epoch
when
Munatius
Demens
was
quaestor
of
the
Parricide
;
because
I
*NL*
am
going
to
be
a
doctor
,
apparently
it
does
not
follow
that
it
is
*NL*
absolutely
necessary
that
I
should
be
an
imbecile
.
I
recommend
you
to
*NL*
moderation
in
your
desires
.
It
is
true
that
my
name
is
Felix
Tholomyes
;
*NL*
I
speak
well
.
Happy
is
he
who
,
when
the
hour
strikes

takes
a
heroic
*NL*
resolve
,
and
abdicates
like
Sylla

Nothing

rose

Pardon
me
ladies
;
that
is
*NL*
Spanish
.
And
the
proof
of
it
,
senoras
,
is
this
:
like
people
,
like
cask
.
*NL*
The
arrobe
of
Castile
contains
sixteen
litres
;
the
cantaro
of
Alicante
,
*NL*
twelve
;
the
almude
of
the
Canaries
,
twenty-five
;
the
cuartin

the
*NL*
Balearic
Isles
,
twenty-six
;
the
boot
of
Tzar
Peter
,
thirty

Long
*NL*
live
that
Tzar
who
was
great
,
and
long
live
his
boot
,
which
was
still
*NL*
greater
!
Ladies
,
take
the
advice
of
a
friend
;
make
a
mistake
in
your
*NL*
neighbor
if
you
see
fit
.
The
property
of
love
is
to
err
.
A
love
*NL*
affair
is
not
made
to
crouch
down
and
brutalize
itself
like
an
English
*NL*
serving-maid
who
has
callouses
on
her
knees
from
scrubbing
.
It
is
not
*NL*
made
for
that
;
it
errs
gayly
,
our
gentle
love
.
It
has
been
said
,
error
*NL*
is
human
;
I
say
,
error
is
love
.
Ladies
,
I
idolize
you
all
.
O
Zephine
,
O
*NL*
Josephine
,
face
more
than
irregular
,
you
would
be
charming
were
you
not
*NL*
all
askew
.
You
have
the
air
of
a
pretty
face
upon
which
some
one
has
*NL*
sat
down
by
mistake
.
As
for
Favourite
,
O
nymphs
and
muses
!
one
day
*NL*
when
Blachevelle
was
crossing
the
gutter
in
the
Rue
Guerin-Boisseau
,
*NL*
he
espied
a
beautiful
girl
with
white
stockings
well
drawn
up
,
which
*NL*
displayed
her
legs
.
This
prologue
pleased
him
,
and
Blachevelle
fell
*NL*
in
love
.
The
one
he
loved
was
Favourite
.
O
Favourite
,
thou
hast
Ionian
*NL*
lips
.
There
was
a
Greek
painter
named
Euphorion
,
who
was
surnamed
the
*NL*
painter
of
the
lips
.
That
Greek
alone
would
have
been
worthy
to
paint
*NL*
thy
mouth
.
Listen
!
before
thee
,
there
was
never
a
creature
worthy
of
the
*NL*
name
.
Thou
wert
made
to
receive
the
apple
like
Venus
,
or
to
eat
it
like
*NL*
Eve
;
beauty
begins
with
thee
.
I
have
just
referred
to
Eve
;
it
is
thou
*NL*
who
hast
created
her
.
Thou
deservest
the
letters-patent
of
the
beautiful
*NL*
woman
.
O
Favourite
,
I
cease
to
address
you
as
`
thou
,
'
because
I
pass
*NL*
from
poetry
to
prose
.
You
were
speaking
of
my
name
a
little
while
ago
.
*NL*
That
touched
me
;
but
let
us
,
whoever
we
may
be
,
distrust
names
.
They
may
*NL*
delude
us
.
I
am
called
Felix
,
and
I
am
not
happy
.
Words
are
liars
.
Let
*NL*
us
not
blindly
accept
the
indications
which
they
afford
us
.
It
would
be
*NL*
a
mistake
to
write
to
Liege
-LSB-
2
-RSB-
for
corks
,
and
to
Pau
for
gloves
.
Miss
*NL*
Dahlia
,
were
I
in
your
place
,
I
would
call
myself
Rosa
.
A
flower
should
*NL*
smell
sweet
,
and
woman
should
have
wit
.
I
say
nothing
of
Fantine
;
she
*NL*
is
a
dreamer
,
a
musing
,
thoughtful
,
pensive
person
;
she
is
a
phantom
*NL*
possessed
of
the
form
of
a
nymph
and
the
modesty
of
a
nun
,
who
has
*NL*
strayed
into
the
life
of
a
grisette
,
but
who
takes
refuge
in
illusions
,
*NL*
and
who
sings
and
prays
and
gazes
into
the
azure
without
very
well
*NL*
knowing
what
she
sees
or
what
she
is
doing
,
and
who
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
*NL*
on
heaven
,
wanders
in
a
garden
where
there
are
more
birds
than
are
in
*NL*
existence
.
O
Fantine
,
know
this
:
I
,
Tholomyes
,
I
am
all
illusion
;
but
*NL*
she
does
not
even
hear
me
,
that
blond
maid
of
Chimeras
!
as
for
the
rest
,
*NL*
everything
about
her
is
freshness
,
suavity
,
youth
,
sweet
morning
light
.
*NL*
O
Fantine
,
maid
worthy
of
being
called
Marguerite
or
Pearl
,
you
are
a
*NL*
woman
from
the
beauteous
Orient
.
Ladies
,
a
second
piece
of
advice
:
do
*NL*
not
marry
;
marriage
is
a
graft
;
it
takes
well
or
ill
;
avoid
that
risk
.
*NL*
But
bah
!
what
am
I
saying
?
I
am
wasting
my
words
.
Girls
are
incurable
*NL*
on
the
subject
of
marriage
,
and
all
that
we
wise
men
can
say
will
not
*NL*
prevent
the
waistcoat-makers
and
the
shoe-stitchers
from
dreaming
*NL*
of
husbands
studded
with
diamonds
.
Well
,
so
be
it
;
but
,
my
beauties
,
*NL*
remember
this
,
you
eat
too
much
sugar
.
You
have
but
one
fault
,
O
woman
,
*NL*
and
that
is
nibbling
sugar
.
O
nibbling
sex
,
your
pretty
little
white
*NL*
teeth
adore
sugar
.
Now
,
heed
me
well
,
sugar
is
a
salt
.
All
salts
are
*NL*
withering
.
Sugar
is
the
most
desiccating
of
all
salts
;
it
sucks
the
*NL*
liquids
of
the
blood
through
the
veins
;
hence
the
coagulation
,
and
then
*NL*
the
solidification
of
the
blood
;
hence
tubercles
in
the
lungs
,
hence
*NL*
death
.
That
is
why
diabetes
borders
on
consumption
.
Then
,
do
not
crunch
*NL*
sugar
,
and
you
will
live
.
I
turn
to
the
men
:
gentlemen
,
make
conquest
,
*NL*
rob
each
other
of
your
well-beloved
without
remorse
.
Chassez
across
.
*NL*
In
love
there
are
no
friends
.
Everywhere
where
there
is
a
pretty
woman
*NL*
hostility
is
open
.
No
quarter
,
war
to
the
death
!
a
pretty
woman
is
a
*NL*
casus
belli
;
a
pretty
woman
is
flagrant
misdemeanor
.
All
the
invasions
*NL*
of
history
have
been
determined
by
petticoats
.
Woman
is
man
's
right
.
*NL*
Romulus
carried
off
the
Sabines
;
William
carried
off
the
Saxon
women
;
*NL*
Caesar
carried
off
the
Roman
women
.
The
man
who
is
not
loved
soars
like
*NL*
a
vulture
over
the
mistresses
of
other
men
;
and
for
my
own
part
,
to
all
*NL*
those
unfortunate
men
who
are
widowers
,
I
throw
the
sublime
proclamation
*NL*
of
Bonaparte
to
the
army
of
Italy
:
``
Soldiers
,
you
are
in
need
of
*NL*
everything
;
the
enemy
has
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tholomyes
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
breath
,
Tholomyes
,
''
said
Blachevelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
Blachevelle
,
supported
by
Listolier
and
Fameuil
,
*NL*
struck
up
to
a
plaintive
air
,
one
of
those
studio
songs
composed
of
*NL*
the
first
words
which
come
to
hand
,
rhymed
richly
and
not
at
all
,
as
*NL*
destitute
of
sense
as
the
gesture
of
the
tree
and
the
sound
of
the
wind
,
*NL*
which
have
their
birth
in
the
vapor
of
pipes
,
and
are
dissipated
and
*NL*
take
their
flight
with
them
.
This
is
the
couplet
by
which
the
group
*NL*
replied
to
Tholomyes
'
harangue
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
father
turkey-cocks
so
grave
*NL*
Some
money
to
an
agent
gave
,
*NL*
That
master
good
Clermont-Tonnerre
*NL*
Might
be
made
pope
on
Saint
Johns
'
day
fair
.
*NL*
But
this
good
Clermont
could
not
be
*NL*
Made
pope
,
because
no
priest
was
he
;
*NL*
And
then
their
agent
,
whose
wrath
burned
,
*NL*
With
all
their
money
back
returned

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
calculated
to
calm
Tholomyes
'
improvisation
;
he
emptied
his
*NL*
glass
,
filled
,
refilled
it
,
and
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

the

observed
Tholomyes

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
looking
at
the
dome
of
the
Invalides
,
which
was
visible
from
*NL*
Bombarda
's
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tholomyes

''
exclaimed
Fameuil
,
``
Listolier
and
I
were
having
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

replied
Tholomyes
;
``
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
We

``
Well

*NL*
``
Which

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
said
Tholomyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
decree
pronounced
,
he
took
a
drink
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
consent
to
live

All
is
not
at
an

For
that
I
return
thanks

immortal

We
lie

*NL*
One
lies
,
but
one
laughs

One
affirms
,
but
one
doubts

The
unexpected
*NL*
bursts
forth
from
the
syllogism
.
That
is
fine
.
There
are
still
human
*NL*
beings
here
below
who
know
how
to
open

close

merrily

This

Again
Fameuil
interrupted
him

Tholomyes

for

oh

there
were
Bombardas

Apuleius

embarked
with

upon
the
fleet
at
Samos
.
One
last
word
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
what
Aspasia
was
,
ladies
?
Although
she
lived
at
an
epoch
when
women
*NL*
had
,
as
yet
,
no
soul
,
she
was
a
soul
;
a
soul
of
a
rosy
and
purple
*NL*
hue
,
more
ardent
hued
than
fire
,
fresher
than
the
dawn
.
Aspasia
was
*NL*
a
creature
in
whom
two
extremes
of
womanhood
met
;
she
was
the
goddess
*NL*
prostitute
;
Socrates
plus
Manon
Lescaut
.
Aspasia
was
created
in
case
a
*NL*
mistress
should
be
needed
for
Prometheus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tholomyes
,
once
started
,
would
have
found
some
difficulty
in
stopping
,
*NL*
had
not
a
horse
fallen
down
upon
the
quay
just
at
that
moment
.
The
*NL*
shock
caused
the
cart
and
the
orator
to
come
to
a
dead
halt
.
It
was
a
*NL*
Beauceron
mare
,
old
and
thin
,
and
one
fit
for
the
knacker
,
which
was
*NL*
dragging
a
very
heavy
cart
.
On
arriving
in
front
of
Bombarda
's
,
the
*NL*
worn-out
,
exhausted
beast
had
refused
to
proceed
any
further
.
This
*NL*
incident
attracted
a
crowd
.
Hardly
had
the
cursing
and
indignant
carter
*NL*
had
time
to
utter
with
proper
energy
the
sacramental
word
,
Matin
-LRB-
the
*NL*
jade
-RRB-
,
backed
up
with
a
pitiless
cut
of
the
whip
,
when
the
jade
fell
,
*NL*
never
to
rise
again
.
On
hearing
the
hubbub
made
by
the
passersby
,
*NL*
Tholomyes
'
merry
auditors
turned
their
heads
,
and
Tholomyes
took
*NL*
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
bring
his
allocution
to
a
close
with
*NL*
this
melancholy
strophe
:
--
*NL*
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Favourite
,
folding
her
arms
and
throwing
her
head
back
,
*NL*
looked
resolutely
at
Tholomyes

said

``

Tholomyes

*NL*
Each
gravely
bestowed
a

on

brow

then
all
four
filed
*NL*
out
through
the
door
,
with
their
fingers
on
their
lips

*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
clapped
her
hands
on
their
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

be

said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

CHAPTER
IX
--
A
MERRY
END
TO
MIRTH
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
young
girls
were
left
alone
,
they
leaned
two
by
two
on
the
*NL*
window-sills
,
chatting
,
craning
out
their
heads
,
and
talking
from
one
*NL*
window
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
the
young
men
emerge
from
the
Cafe
Bombarda
arm
in
arm
.
The
*NL*
latter
turned
round
,
made
signs
to
them
,
smiled
,
and
disappeared
in
*NL*
that
dusty
Sunday
throng
which
makes
a
weekly
invasion
into
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
long
!
''
cried
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
going
to
bring
us
?
''
said
Zephine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
certainly
be
something
pretty
,
''
said
Dahlia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
,
''
said
Favourite
,
``
I
want
it
to
be
of
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
attention
was
soon
distracted
by
the
movements
on
the
shore
of
the
*NL*
lake
,
which
they
could
see
through
the
branches
of
the
large
trees
,
and
*NL*
which
diverted
them
greatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
hour
for
the
departure
of
the
mail-coaches
and
diligences
.
*NL*
Nearly
all
the
stage-coaches
for
the
south
and
west
passed
through
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysees
.
The
majority
followed
the
quay
and
went
through
the
*NL*
Passy
Barrier
.
From
moment
to
moment
,
some
huge
vehicle
,
painted
yellow
*NL*
and
black
,
heavily
loaded
,
noisily
harnessed
,
rendered
shapeless
*NL*
by
trunks
,
tarpaulins
,
and
valises
,
full
of
heads
which
immediately
*NL*
disappeared
,
rushed
through
the
crowd
with
all
the
sparks
of
a
forge
,
*NL*
with
dust
for
smoke
,
and
an
air
of
fury
,
grinding
the
pavements
,
*NL*
changing
all
the
paving-stones
into
steels
.
This
uproar
delighted
the
*NL*
young
girls
.
Favourite
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
row
!
One
would
say
that
it
was
a
pile
of
chains
flying
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
one
of
these
vehicles
,
which
they
could
only
see
with
*NL*
difficulty
through
the
thick
elms
,
halted
for
a
moment
,
then
set
out
*NL*
again
at
a
gallop
.
This
surprised
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
odd
!
''
said
she
.
``
I
thought
the
diligence
never
stopped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
Fantine
is
surprising
.
I
am
coming
to
take
a
look
at
her
out
of
*NL*
curiosity
.
She
is
dazzled
by
the
simplest
things
.
Suppose
a
case
:
I
am
*NL*
a
traveller
;
I
say
to
the
diligence
,
'
I
will
go
on
in
advance
;
you
shall
*NL*
pick
me
up
on
the
quay
as
you
pass
.
'
The
diligence
passes
,
sees
me
,
*NL*
halts
,
and
takes
me
.
That
is
done
every
day
.
You
do
not
know
life
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
a
certain
time
elapsed
.
All
at
once
Favourite
made
a
*NL*
movement
,
like
a
person
who
is
just
waking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
the
surprise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
by
the
way
,
''
joined
in
Dahlia
,
``
the
famous
surprise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
a
very
long
time
about
it
!
''
said
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Fantine
concluded
this
sigh
,
the
waiter
who
had
served
them
at
dinner
*NL*
entered
.
He
held
in
his
hand
something
which
resembled
a
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
demanded
Favourite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
paper
that
those
gentlemen
left
for
these
ladies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
bring
it
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
``
the
gentlemen
ordered
me
not
to
deliver
it
*NL*
to
the
ladies
for
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Favourite
snatched
the
paper
from
the
waiter
's
hand
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
a
*NL*
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
said
she
;
``
there
is
no
address
;
but
this
is
what
is
written
on
*NL*
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
THIS
IS
THE
SURPRISE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tore
the
letter
open
hastily
,
opened
it
,
and
read
-LSB-
she
knew
how
to
*NL*
read
-RSB-
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

are
called
fathers

by

which
is
puerile

honest

Now

these

*NL*
There
was
,
at
Montfermeil
,
near
Paris
,
during
the
first
quarter
of
this
*NL*
century
,
a
sort
of
cook-shop
which
no
longer
exists
.
This
cook-shop
was
*NL*
kept
by
some
people
named
Thenardier
,
husband
and
wife
.
It
was
situated
*NL*
in
Boulanger
Lane
.
Over
the
door
there
was
a
board
nailed
flat
against
*NL*
the
wall
.
Upon
this
board
was
painted
something
which
resembled
a
*NL*
man
carrying
another
man
on
his
back
,
the
latter
wearing
the
big
gilt
*NL*
epaulettes
of
a
general
,
with
large
silver
stars
;
red
spots
represented
*NL*
blood
;
the
rest
of
the
picture
consisted
of
smoke
,
and
probably
*NL*
represented
a
battle
.
Below
ran
this
inscription
:
AT
THE
SIGN
OF
*NL*
SERGEANT
OF
WATERLOO
-LRB-
Au
Sargent
de
Waterloo
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
common
than
a
cart
or
a
truck
at
the
door
of
a
hostelry
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
vehicle
,
or
,
to
speak
more
accurately
,
the
fragment
of
*NL*
a
vehicle
,
which
encumbered
the
street
in
front
of
the
cook-shop
of
the
*NL*
Sergeant
of
Waterloo
,
one
evening
in
the
spring
of
1818
,
would
certainly
*NL*
have
attracted
,
by
its
mass
,
the
attention
of
any
painter
who
had
passed
*NL*
that
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
fore-carriage
of
one
of
those
trucks
which
are
used
in
wooded
*NL*
tracts
of
country
,
and
which
serve
to
transport
thick
planks
and
the
*NL*
trunks
of
trees
.
This
fore-carriage
was
composed
of
a
massive
iron
*NL*
axle-tree
with
a
pivot
,
into
which
was
fitted
a
heavy
shaft
,
and
*NL*
which
was
supported
by
two
huge
wheels
.
The
whole
thing
was
compact
,
*NL*
overwhelming
,
and
misshapen
.
It
seemed
like
the
gun-carriage
of
an
*NL*
enormous
cannon
.
The
ruts
of
the
road
had
bestowed
on
the
wheels
,
the
*NL*
fellies
,
the
hub
,
the
axle
,
and
the
shaft
,
a
layer
of
mud
,
a
hideous
*NL*
yellowish
daubing
hue
,
tolerably
like
that
with
which
people
are
fond
*NL*
of
ornamenting
cathedrals
.
The
wood
was
disappearing
under
mud
,
and
the
*NL*
iron
beneath
rust
.
Under
the
axle-tree
hung
,
like
drapery
,
a
huge
chain
,
*NL*
worthy
of
some
Goliath
of
a
convict
.
This
chain
suggested
,
not
the
*NL*
beams
,
which
it
was
its
office
to
transport
,
but
the
mastodons
and
*NL*
mammoths
which
it
might
have
served
to
harness
;
it
had
the
air
of
the
*NL*
galleys
,
but
of
cyclopean
and
superhuman
galleys
,
and
it
seemed
to
have
*NL*
been
detached
from
some
monster
.
Homer
would
have
bound
Polyphemus
with
*NL*
it
,
and
Shakespeare
,
Caliban
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
was
that
fore-carriage
of
a
truck
in
that
place
in
the
street
?
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
to
encumber
the
street
;
next
,
in
order
that
it
might
*NL*
finish
the
process
of
rusting
.
There
is
a
throng
of
institutions
in
the
*NL*
old
social
order
,
which
one
comes
across
in
this
fashion
as
one
walks
*NL*
about
outdoors
,
and
which
have
no
other
reasons
for
existence
than
the
*NL*
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
centre
of
the
chain
swung
very
near
the
ground
in
the
middle
,
and
in
*NL*
the
loop
,
as
in
the
rope
of
a
swing
,
there
were
seated
and
grouped
,
on
*NL*
that
particular
evening
,
in
exquisite
interlacement
,
two
little
girls
;
*NL*
one
about
two
years
and
a
half
old
,
the
other
,
eighteen
months
;
the
*NL*
younger
in
the
arms
of
the
other
.
A
handkerchief
,
cleverly
knotted
about
*NL*
them
,
prevented
their
falling
out
.
A
mother
had
caught
sight
of
that
*NL*
frightful
chain
,
and
had
said
,
``
Come
!
there
's
a
plaything
for
my
*NL*
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
,
who
were
dressed
prettily
and
with
some
elegance
,
were
*NL*
radiant
with
pleasure
;
one
would
have
said
that
they
were
two
roses
amid
*NL*
old
iron
;
their
eyes
were
a
triumph
;
their
fresh
cheeks
were
full
of
*NL*
laughter
.
One
had
chestnut
hair
;
the
other
,
brown
.
Their
innocent
faces
*NL*
were
two
delighted
surprises
;
a
blossoming
shrub
which
grew
near
wafted
*NL*
to
the
passers-by
perfumes
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
them
;
the
child
*NL*
of
eighteen
months
displayed
her
pretty
little
bare
stomach
with
the
*NL*
chaste
indecency
of
childhood
.
Above
and
around
these
two
delicate
*NL*
heads
,
all
made
of
happiness
and
steeped
in
light
,
the
gigantic
*NL*
fore-carriage
,
black
with
rust
,
almost
terrible
,
all
entangled
in
curves
*NL*
and
wild
angles
,
rose
in
a
vault
,
like
the
entrance
of
a
cavern
.
A
few
*NL*
paces
apart
,
crouching
down
upon
the
threshold
of
the
hostelry
,
the
*NL*
mother
,
not
a
very
prepossessing
woman
,
by
the
way
,
though
touching
*NL*
at
that
moment
,
was
swinging
the
two
children
by
means
of
a
long
cord
,
*NL*
watching
them
carefully
,
for
fear
of
accidents
,
with
that
animal
and
*NL*
celestial
expression
which
is
peculiar
to
maternity
.
At
every
backward
*NL*
and
forward
swing
the
hideous
links
emitted
a
strident
sound
,
which
*NL*
resembled
a
cry
of
rage
;
the
little
girls
were
in
ecstasies
;
the
setting
*NL*
sun
mingled
in
this
joy
,
and
nothing
could
be
more
charming
than
this
*NL*
caprice
of
chance
which
had
made
of
a
chain
of
Titans
the
swing
of
*NL*
cherubim
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
rocked
her
little
ones
,
the
mother
hummed
in
a
discordant
voice
a
*NL*
romance
then
celebrated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
,
said
a
warrior
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Her
song
,
and
the
contemplation
of
her
daughters
,
prevented
her
hearing
*NL*
and
seeing
what
was
going
on
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
some
one
had
approached
her
,
as
she
was
beginning
the
*NL*
first
couplet
of
the
romance
,
and
suddenly
she
heard
a
voice
saying
very
*NL*
near
her
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
two
beautiful
children
there
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
fair
and
tender
Imogene
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
replied
the
mother
,
continuing
her
romance
;
then
she
turned
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
stood
before
her
,
a
few
paces
distant
.
This
woman
also
had
a
*NL*
child
,
which
she
carried
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
carrying
,
in
addition
,
a
large
carpet-bag
,
which
seemed
very
*NL*
heavy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
's
child
was
one
of
the
most
divine
creatures
that
it
is
*NL*
possible
to
behold
.
It
was
a
girl
,
two
or
three
years
of
age
.
She
could
*NL*
have
entered
into
competition
with
the
two
other
little
ones
,
so
far
as
*NL*
the
coquetry
of
her
dress
was
concerned
;
she
wore
a
cap
of
fine
linen
,
*NL*
ribbons
on
her
bodice
,
and
Valenciennes
lace
on
her
cap
.
The
folds
of
*NL*
her
skirt
were
raised
so
as
to
permit
a
view
of
her
white
,
firm
,
and
*NL*
dimpled
leg
.
She
was
admirably
rosy
and
healthy
.
The
little
beauty
*NL*
inspired
a
desire
to
take
a
bite
from
the
apples
of
her
cheeks
.
Of
her
*NL*
eyes
nothing
could
be
known
,
except
that
they
must
be
very
large
,
and
*NL*
that
they
had
magnificent
lashes
.
She
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slept
with
that
slumber
of
absolute
confidence
peculiar
to
her
*NL*
age
.
The
arms
of
mothers
are
made
of
tenderness
;
in
them
children
sleep
*NL*
profoundly
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
mother
,
her
appearance
was
sad
and
poverty-stricken
.
She
*NL*
was
dressed
like
a
working-woman
who
is
inclined
to
turn
into
a
peasant
*NL*
again
.
She
was
young
.
Was
she
handsome
?
Perhaps
;
but
in
that
attire
it
*NL*
was
not
apparent
.
Her
hair
,
a
golden
lock
of
which
had
escaped
,
seemed
*NL*
very
thick
,
but
was
severely
concealed
beneath
an
ugly
,
tight
,
close
,
*NL*
nun-like
cap
,
tied
under
the
chin
.
A
smile
displays
beautiful
teeth
when
*NL*
one
has
them
;
but
she
did
not
smile
.
Her
eyes
did
not
seem
to
have
been
*NL*
dry
for
a
very
long
time
.
She
was
pale
;
she
had
a
very
weary
and
rather
*NL*
sickly
appearance
.
She
gazed
upon
her
daughter
asleep
in
her
arms
with
*NL*
the
air
peculiar
to
a
mother
who
has
nursed
her
own
child
.
A
large
blue
*NL*
handkerchief
,
such
as
the
Invalides
use
,
was
folded
into
a
fichu
,
and
*NL*
concealed
her
figure
clumsily
.
Her
hands
were
sunburnt
and
all
dotted
*NL*
with
freckles
,
her
forefinger
was
hardened
and
lacerated
with
the
*NL*
needle
;
she
wore
a
cloak
of
coarse
brown
woollen
stuff
,
a
linen
gown
,
*NL*
and
coarse
shoes
.
It
was
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Fantine
,
but
difficult
to
recognize
.
Nevertheless
,
on
*NL*
scrutinizing
her
attentively
,
it
was
evident
that
she
still
retained
*NL*
her
beauty
.
A
melancholy
fold
,
which
resembled
the
beginning
of
irony
,
*NL*
wrinkled
her
right
cheek
.
As
for
her
toilette
,
that
aerial
toilette
of
*NL*
muslin
and
ribbons
,
which
seemed
made
of
mirth
,
of
folly
,
and
of
music
,
*NL*
full
of
bells
,
and
perfumed
with
lilacs
had
vanished
like
that
beautiful
*NL*
and
dazzling
hoar-frost
which
is
mistaken
for
diamonds
in
the
sunlight
;
*NL*
it
melts
and
leaves
the
branch
quite
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ten
months
had
elapsed
since
the
``
pretty
farce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
taken
place
during
those
ten
months
?
It
can
be
divined
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
abandonment
,
straightened
circumstances
.
Fantine
had
immediately
*NL*
lost
sight
of
Favourite
,
Zephine
and
Dahlia
;
the
bond
once
broken
on
the
*NL*
side
of
the
men
,
it
was
loosed
between
the
women
;
they
would
have
been
*NL*
greatly
astonished
had
any
one
told
them
a
fortnight
later
,
that
they
*NL*
had
been
friends
;
there
no
longer
existed
any
reason
for
such
a
thing
.
*NL*
Fantine
had
remained
alone
.
The
father
of
her
child
gone
,
--
alas
!
such
*NL*
ruptures
are
irrevocable
,
--
she
found
herself
absolutely
isolated
,
minus
*NL*
the
habit
of
work
and
plus
the
taste
for
pleasure
.
Drawn
away
by
her
*NL*
liaison
with
Tholomyes
to
disdain
the
pretty
trade
which
she
knew
,
she
*NL*
had
neglected
to
keep
her
market
open
;
it
was
now
closed
to
her
.
She
had
*NL*
no
resource
.
Fantine
barely
knew
how
to
read
,
and
did
not
know
how
to
*NL*
write
;
in
her
childhood
she
had
only
been
taught
to
sign
her
name
;
*NL*
she
had
a
public
letter-writer
indite
an
epistle
to
Tholomyes
,
then
a
*NL*
second
,
then
a
third
.
Tholomyes
replied
to
none
of
them
.
Fantine
heard
*NL*
the
gossips
say
,
as
they
looked
at
her
child
:
``
Who
takes
those
children
*NL*
seriously
!
One
only
shrugs
one
's
shoulders
over
such
children
!
''
Then
she
*NL*
thought
of
Tholomyes
,
who
had
shrugged
his
shoulders
over
his
child
,
*NL*
and
who
did
not
take
that
innocent
being
seriously
;
and
her
heart
grew
*NL*
gloomy
toward
that
man
.
But
what
was
she
to
do
?
She
no
longer
knew
to
*NL*
whom
to
apply
.
She
had
committed
a
fault
,
but
the
foundation
of
her
*NL*
nature
,
as
will
be
remembered
,
was
modesty
and
virtue
.
She
was
vaguely
*NL*
conscious
that
she
was
on
the
verge
of
falling
into
distress
,
and
of
*NL*
gliding
into
a
worse
state
.
Courage
was
necessary
;
she
possessed
it
,
and
*NL*
held
herself
firm
.
The
idea
of
returning
to
her
native
town
of
M.
sur
*NL*
M.
occurred
to
her
.
There
,
some
one
might
possibly
know
her
and
give
her
*NL*
work
;
yes
,
but
it
would
be
necessary
to
conceal
her
fault
.
In
a
confused
*NL*
way
she
perceived
the
necessity
of
a
separation
which
would
be
more
*NL*
painful
than
the
first
one
.
Her
heart
contracted
,
but
she
took
her
*NL*
resolution
.
Fantine
,
as
we
shall
see
,
had
the
fierce
bravery
of
life
.
*NL*
She
had
already
valiantly
renounced
finery
,
had
dressed
herself
in
*NL*
linen
,
and
had
put
all
her
silks
,
all
her
ornaments
,
all
her
ribbons
,
*NL*
and
all
her
laces
on
her
daughter
,
the
only
vanity
which
was
left
to
*NL*
her
,
and
a
holy
one
it
was
.
She
sold
all
that
she
had
,
which
produced
*NL*
for
her
two
hundred
francs
;
her
little
debts
paid
,
she
had
only
about
*NL*
eighty
francs
left
.
At
the
age
of
twenty-two
,
on
a
beautiful
spring
*NL*
morning
,
she
quitted
Paris
,
bearing
her
child
on
her
back
.
Any
one
who
*NL*
had
seen
these
two
pass
would
have
had
pity
on
them
.
This
woman
had
,
*NL*
in
all
the
world
,
nothing
but
her
child
,
and
the
child
had
,
in
all
the
*NL*
world
,
no
one
but
this
woman
.
Fantine
had
nursed
her
child
,
and
this
had
*NL*
tired
her
chest
,
and
she
coughed
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
have
no
further
occasion
to
speak
of
M.
Felix
Tholomyes
.
Let
us
*NL*
confine
ourselves
to
saying
,
that
,
twenty
years
later
,
under
King
Louis
*NL*
Philippe
,
he
was
a
great
provincial
lawyer
,
wealthy
and
influential
,
a
*NL*
wise
elector
,
and
a
very
severe
juryman
;
he
was
still
a
man
of
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
middle
of
the
day
,
after
having
,
from
time
to
time
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
resting
herself
,
travelled
,
for
three
or
four
sous
a
league
,
in
*NL*
what
was
then
known
as
the
Petites
Voitures
des
Environs
de
Paris
,
the
*NL*
``
little
suburban
coach
service
,
''
Fantine
found
herself
at
Montfermeil
,
*NL*
in
the
alley
Boulanger
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
passed
the
Thenardier
hostelry
,
the
two
little
girls
,
blissful
*NL*
in
the
monster
swing
,
had
dazzled
her
in
a
manner
,
and
she
had
halted
in
*NL*
front
of
that
vision
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charms
exist
.
These
two
little
girls
were
a
charm
to
this
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
at
them
in
much
emotion
.
The
presence
of
angels
is
an
*NL*
announcement
of
Paradise
.
She
thought
that
,
above
this
inn
,
she
beheld
*NL*
the
mysterious
HERE
of
Providence
.
These
two
little
creatures
were
*NL*
evidently
happy
.
She
gazed
at
them
,
she
admired
them
,
in
such
emotion
*NL*
that
at
the
moment
when
their
mother
was
recovering
her
breath
between
*NL*
two
couplets
of
her
song
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
addressing
to
her
*NL*
the
remark
which
we
have
just
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
two
pretty
children
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
ferocious
creatures
are
disarmed
by
caresses
bestowed
on
their
*NL*
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
raised
her
head
and
thanked
her
,
and
bade
the
wayfarer
*NL*
sit
down
on
the
bench
at
the
door
,
she
herself
being
seated
on
the
*NL*
threshold
.
The
two
women
began
to
chat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Madame
Thenardier
,
''
said
the
mother
of
the
two
little
girls
.
*NL*
``
We
keep
this
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
her
mind
still
running
on
her
romance
,
she
resumed
humming
between
*NL*
her
teeth
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
so
;
I
am
a
knight
,
*NL*
And
I
am
off
to
Palestine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
Madame
Thenardier
was
a
sandy-complexioned
woman
,
thin
and
*NL*
angular
--
the
type
of
the
soldier
's
wife
in
all
its
unpleasantness
;
and
*NL*
what
was
odd
,
with
a
languishing
air
,
which
she
owed
to
her
perusal
*NL*
of
romances
.
She
was
a
simpering
,
but
masculine
creature
.
Old
romances
*NL*
produce
that
effect
when
rubbed
against
the
imagination
of
cook-shop
*NL*
woman
.
She
was
still
young
;
she
was
barely
thirty
.
If
this
crouching
*NL*
woman
had
stood
upright
,
her
lofty
stature
and
her
frame
of
a
*NL*
perambulating
colossus
suitable
for
fairs
,
might
have
frightened
the
*NL*
traveller
at
the
outset
,
troubled
her
confidence
,
and
disturbed
what
*NL*
caused
what
we
have
to
relate
to
vanish
.
A
person
who
is
seated
instead
*NL*
of
standing
erect
--
destinies
hang
upon
such
a
thing
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
told
her
story
,
with
slight
modifications
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
she
was
a
working-woman
;
that
her
husband
was
dead
;
that
her
*NL*
work
in
Paris
had
failed
her
,
and
that
she
was
on
her
way
to
seek
it
*NL*
elsewhere
,
in
her
own
native
parts
;
that
she
had
left
Paris
that
morning
*NL*
on
foot
;
that
,
as
she
was
carrying
her
child
,
and
felt
fatigued
,
she
had
*NL*
got
into
the
Villemomble
coach
when
she
met
it
;
that
from
Villemomble
*NL*
she
had
come
to
Montfermeil
on
foot
;
that
the
little
one
had
walked
a
*NL*
little
,
but
not
much
,
because
she
was
so
young
,
and
that
she
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
take
her
up
,
and
the
jewel
had
fallen
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
word
she
bestowed
on
her
daughter
a
passionate
kiss
,
which
woke
*NL*
her
.
The
child
opened
her
eyes
,
great
blue
eyes
like
her
mother
's
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
--
what
?
Nothing
;
with
that
serious
and
sometimes
severe
air
of
*NL*
little
children
,
which
is
a
mystery
of
their
luminous
innocence
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
our
twilight
of
virtue
.
One
would
say
that
they
feel
*NL*
themselves
to
be
angels
,
and
that
they
know
us
to
be
men
.
Then
the
child
*NL*
began
to
laugh
;
and
although
the
mother
held
fast
to
her
,
she
slipped
to
*NL*
the
ground
with
the
unconquerable
energy
of
a
little
being
which
wished
*NL*
to
run
.
All
at
once
she
caught
sight
of
the
two
others
in
the
swing
,
*NL*
stopped
short
,
and
put
out
her
tongue
,
in
sign
of
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Thenardier
released
her
daughters
,
made
them
descend
from
the
*NL*
swing
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
amuse
yourselves
,
all
three
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Children
become
acquainted
quickly
at
that
age
,
and
at
the
expiration
*NL*
of
a
minute
the
little
Thenardiers
were
playing
with
the
new-comer
at
*NL*
making
holes
in
the
ground
,
which
was
an
immense
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
new-comer
was
very
gay
;
the
goodness
of
the
mother
is
written
in
the
*NL*
gayety
of
the
child
;
she
had
seized
a
scrap
of
wood
which
served
her
*NL*
for
a
shovel
,
and
energetically
dug
a
cavity
big
enough
for
a
fly
.
The
*NL*
grave-digger
's
business
becomes
a
subject
for
laughter
when
performed
by
*NL*
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
women
pursued
their
chat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
little
one
's
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Cosette
,
read
Euphrasie
.
The
child
's
name
was
Euphrasie
.
But
out
*NL*
of
Euphrasie
the
mother
had
made
Cosette
by
that
sweet
and
graceful
*NL*
instinct
of
mothers
and
of
the
populace
which
changes
Josepha
into
*NL*
Pepita
,
and
Francoise
into
Sillette
.
It
is
a
sort
of
derivative
which
*NL*
disarranges
and
disconcerts
the
whole
science
of
etymologists
.
We
have
*NL*
known
a
grandmother
who
succeeded
in
turning
Theodore
into
Gnon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
going
on
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
age
of
my
eldest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
three
little
girls
were
grouped
in
an
attitude
of
*NL*
profound
anxiety
and
blissfulness
;
an
event
had
happened
;
a
big
worm
*NL*
had
emerged
from
the
ground
,
and
they
were
afraid
;
and
they
were
in
*NL*
ecstasies
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
radiant
brows
touched
each
other
;
one
would
have
said
that
there
*NL*
were
three
heads
in
one
aureole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
easily
children
get
acquainted
at
once
!
''
exclaimed
Mother
*NL*
Thenardier
;
``
one
would
swear
that
they
were
three
sisters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
was
probably
the
spark
which
the
other
mother
had
been
*NL*
waiting
for
.
She
seized
the
Thenardier
's
hand
,
looked
at
her
fixedly
,
*NL*
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
keep
my
child
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
made
one
of
those
movements
of
surprise
which
signify
*NL*
neither
assent
nor
refusal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
's
mother
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
can
not
take
my
daughter
to
the
country
.
My
work
will
not
*NL*
permit
it
.
With
a
child
one
can
find
no
situation
.
People
are
ridiculous
*NL*
in
the
country
.
It
was
the
good
God
who
caused
me
to
pass
your
inn
.
When
*NL*
I
caught
sight
of
your
little
ones
,
so
pretty
,
so
clean
,
and
so
happy
,
*NL*
it
overwhelmed
me
.
I
said
:
`
Here
is
a
good
mother
.
That
is
just
the
*NL*
thing
;
that
will
make
three
sisters
.
'
And
then
,
it
will
not
be
long
*NL*
before
I
return
.
Will
you
keep
my
child
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
see
about
it
,
''
replied
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
give
you
six
francs
a
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
man
's
voice
called
from
the
depths
of
the
cook-shop
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
less
than
seven
francs
.
And
six
months
paid
in
advance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
times
seven
makes
forty-two
,
''
said
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
give
it
,
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
fifteen
francs
in
addition
for
preliminary
expenses
,
''
added
the
*NL*
man
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Total
,
fifty-seven
francs
,
''
said
Madame
Thenardier
.
And
she
hummed
*NL*
vaguely
,
with
these
figures
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
,
said
a
warrior
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
pay
it
,
''
said
the
mother
.
``
I
have
eighty
francs
.
I
shall
have
*NL*
enough
left
to
reach
the
country
,
by
travelling
on
foot
.
I
shall
*NL*
earn
money
there
,
and
as
soon
as
I
have
a
little
I
will
return
for
my
*NL*
darling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
voice
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
one
has
an
outfit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
my
husband
,
''
said
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
has
an
outfit
,
the
poor
treasure
.
--
I
understood
perfectly
*NL*
that
it
was
your
husband
.
--
And
a
beautiful
outfit
,
too
!
a
senseless
*NL*
outfit
,
everything
by
the
dozen
,
and
silk
gowns
like
a
lady
.
It
is
here
,
*NL*
in
my
carpet-bag
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
hand
it
over
,
''
struck
in
the
man
's
voice
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
shall
give
it
to
you
,
''
said
the
mother
.
``
It
would
be
very
*NL*
queer
if
I
were
to
leave
my
daughter
quite
naked
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
master
's
face
appeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bargain
was
concluded
.
The
mother
passed
the
night
at
the
inn
,
gave
*NL*
up
her
money
and
left
her
child
,
fastened
her
carpet-bag
once
more
,
now
*NL*
reduced
in
volume
by
the
removal
of
the
outfit
,
and
light
henceforth
*NL*
and
set
out
on
the
following
morning
,
intending
to
return
soon
.
People
*NL*
arrange
such
departures
tranquilly
;
but
they
are
despairs
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
neighbor
of
the
Thenardiers
met
this
mother
as
she
was
setting
out
,
*NL*
and
came
back
with
the
remark
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
seen
a
woman
crying
in
the
street
so
that
it
was
enough
to
*NL*
rend
your
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Cosette
's
mother
had
taken
her
departure
,
the
man
said
to
the
*NL*
woman
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
serve
to
pay
my
note
for
one
hundred
and
ten
francs
which
*NL*
falls
due
to-morrow
;
I
lacked
fifty
francs
.
Do
you
know
that
I
should
*NL*
have
had
a
bailiff
and
a
protest
after
me
?
You
played
the
mouse-trap
*NL*
nicely
with
your
young
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
suspecting
it
,
''
said
the
woman
.

CHAPTER
II
--
FIRST
SKETCH
OF
TWO
UNPREPOSSESSING
FIGURES
*NL*
*NL*
The
mouse
which
had
been
caught
was
a
pitiful
specimen
;
but
the
cat
*NL*
rejoices
even
over
a
lean
mouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
were
these
Thenardiers
?
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
a
word
or
two
of
them
now
.
We
will
complete
the
sketch
later
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
beings
belonged
to
that
bastard
class
composed
of
coarse
people
*NL*
who
have
been
successful
,
and
of
intelligent
people
who
have
descended
*NL*
in
the
scale
,
which
is
between
the
class
called
``
middle
''
and
the
class
*NL*
denominated
as
``
inferior
,
''
and
which
combines
some
of
the
defects
of
the
*NL*
second
with
nearly
all
the
vices
of
the
first
,
without
possessing
*NL*
the
generous
impulse
of
the
workingman
nor
the
honest
order
of
the
*NL*
bourgeois
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
of
those
dwarfed
natures
which
,
if
a
dull
fire
chances
to
warm
*NL*
them
up
,
easily
become
monstrous
.
There
was
in
the
woman
a
substratum
*NL*
of
the
brute
,
and
in
the
man
the
material
for
a
blackguard
.
Both
were
*NL*
susceptible
,
in
the
highest
degree
,
of
the
sort
of
hideous
progress
*NL*
which
is
accomplished
in
the
direction
of
evil
.
There
exist
crab-like
*NL*
souls
which
are
continually
retreating
towards
the
darkness
,
*NL*
retrograding
in
life
rather
than
advancing
,
employing
experience
to
*NL*
augment
their
deformity
,
growing
incessantly
worse
,
and
becoming
more
*NL*
and
more
impregnated
with
an
ever-augmenting
blackness
.
This
man
and
*NL*
woman
possessed
such
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
in
particular
,
was
troublesome
for
a
physiognomist
.
One
can
*NL*
only
look
at
some
men
to
distrust
them
;
for
one
feels
that
they
are
*NL*
dark
in
both
directions
.
They
are
uneasy
in
the
rear
and
threatening
*NL*
in
front
.
There
is
something
of
the
unknown
about
them
.
One
can
no
more
*NL*
answer
for
what
they
have
done
than
for
what
they
will
do
.
The
shadow
*NL*
which
they
bear
in
their
glance
denounces
them
.
From
merely
hearing
them
*NL*
utter
a
word
or
seeing
them
make
a
gesture
,
one
obtains
a
glimpse
of
*NL*
sombre
secrets
in
their
past
and
of
sombre
mysteries
in
their
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Thenardier
,
if
he
himself
was
to
be
believed
,
had
been
a
soldier
--
a
*NL*
sergeant
,
he
said
.
He
had
probably
been
through
the
campaign
of
1815
,
*NL*
and
had
even
conducted
himself
with
tolerable
valor
,
it
would
seem
.
We
*NL*
shall
see
later
on
how
much
truth
there
was
in
this
.
The
sign
of
his
*NL*
hostelry
was
in
allusion
to
one
of
his
feats
of
arms
.
He
had
painted
it
*NL*
himself
;
for
he
knew
how
to
do
a
little
of
everything
,
and
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
epoch
when
the
ancient
classical
romance
which
,
after
*NL*
having
been
Clelie
,
was
no
longer
anything
but
Lodoiska
,
still
noble
,
*NL*
but
ever
more
and
more
vulgar
,
having
fallen
from
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Scuderi
to
Madame
Bournon-Malarme
,
and
from
Madame
de
Lafayette
to
*NL*
Madame
Barthelemy-Hadot
,
was
setting
the
loving
hearts
of
the
portresses
*NL*
of
Paris
aflame
,
and
even
ravaging
the
suburbs
to
some
extent
.
Madame
*NL*
Thenardier
was
just
intelligent
enough
to
read
this
sort
of
books
.
She
*NL*
lived
on
them
.
In
them
she
drowned
what
brains
she
possessed
.
This
had
*NL*
given
her
,
when
very
young
,
and
even
a
little
later
,
a
sort
of
pensive
*NL*
attitude
towards
her
husband
,
a
scamp
of
a
certain
depth
,
a
ruffian
*NL*
lettered
to
the
extent
of
the
grammar
,
coarse
and
fine
at
one
and
the
*NL*
same
time
,
but
,
so
far
as
sentimentalism
was
concerned
,
given
to
the
*NL*
perusal
of
Pigault-Lebrun
,
and
``
in
what
concerns
the
sex
,
''
as
he
said
*NL*
in
his
jargon
--
a
downright
,
unmitigated
lout
.
His
wife
was
twelve
or
*NL*
fifteen
years
younger
than
he
was
.
Later
on
,
when
her
hair
,
arranged
in
*NL*
a
romantically
drooping
fashion
,
began
to
grow
gray
,
when
the
Magaera
*NL*
began
to
be
developed
from
the
Pamela
,
the
female
Thenardier
was
nothing
*NL*
but
a
coarse
,
vicious
woman
,
who
had
dabbled
in
stupid
romances
.
Now
,
*NL*
one
can
not
read
nonsense
with
impunity
.
The
result
was
that
her
eldest
*NL*
daughter
was
named
Eponine
;
as
for
the
younger
,
the
poor
little
thing
*NL*
came
near
being
called
Gulnare
;
I
know
not
to
what
diversion
,
effected
*NL*
by
a
romance
of
Ducray-Dumenil
,
she
owed
the
fact
that
she
merely
bore
*NL*
the
name
of
Azelma
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
we
will
remark
by
the
way
,
everything
was
not
ridiculous
and
*NL*
superficial
in
that
curious
epoch
to
which
we
are
alluding
,
and
which
*NL*
may
be
designated
as
the
anarchy
of
baptismal
names
.
By
the
side
of
*NL*
this
romantic
element
which
we
have
just
indicated
there
is
the
social
*NL*
symptom
.
It
is
not
rare
for
the
neatherd
's
boy
nowadays
to
bear
the
name
*NL*
of
Arthur
,
Alfred
,
or
Alphonse
,
and
for
the
vicomte
--
if
there
are
*NL*
still
any
vicomtes
--
to
be
called
Thomas
,
Pierre
,
or
Jacques
.
This
*NL*
displacement
,
which
places
the
``
elegant
''
name
on
the
plebeian
and
the
*NL*
rustic
name
on
the
aristocrat
,
is
nothing
else
than
an
eddy
of
equality
.
*NL*
The
irresistible
penetration
of
the
new
inspiration
is
there
as
*NL*
everywhere
else
.
Beneath
this
apparent
discord
there
is
a
great
and
a
*NL*
profound
thing
,
--
the
French
Revolution
.

CHAPTER

--
THE
LARK
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
all
in
all
sufficient
to
be
wicked
in
order
to
prosper
.
The
*NL*
cook-shop
was
in
a
bad
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
traveller
's
fifty-seven
francs
,
Thenardier
had
been
able
*NL*
to
avoid
a
protest
and
to
honor
his
signature
.
On
the
following
month
*NL*
they
were
again
in
need
of
money
.
The
woman
took
Cosette
's
outfit
to
*NL*
Paris
,
and
pawned
it
at
the
pawnbroker
's
for
sixty
francs
.
As
soon
*NL*
as
that
sum
was
spent
,
the
Thenardiers
grew
accustomed
to
look
on
the
*NL*
little
girl
merely
as
a
child
whom
they
were
caring
for
out
of
charity
;
*NL*
and
they
treated
her
accordingly
.
As
she
had
no
longer
any
clothes
,
they
*NL*
dressed
her
in
the
cast-off
petticoats
and
chemises
of
the
Thenardier
*NL*
brats
;
that
is
to
say
,
in
rags
.
They
fed
her
on
what
all
the
rest
*NL*
had
left
--
a
little
better
than
the
dog
,
a
little
worse
than
the
cat
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
cat
and
the
dog
were
her
habitual
table-companions
;
*NL*
Cosette
ate
with
them
under
the
table
,
from
a
wooden
bowl
similar
to
*NL*
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
,
who
had
established
herself
,
as
we
shall
see
later
on
,
at
M.
*NL*
sur
M.
,
wrote
,
or
,
more
correctly
,
caused
to
be
written
,
a
letter
every
*NL*
month
,
that
she
might
have
news
of
her
child
.
The
Thenardiers
replied
*NL*
invariably
,
``
Cosette
is
doing
wonderfully
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
the
first
six
months
the
mother
sent
seven
francs
*NL*
for
the
seventh
month
,
and
continued
her
remittances
with
tolerable
*NL*
regularity
from
month
to
month
.
The
year
was
not
completed
when
*NL*
Thenardier
said
:
``
A
fine
favor
she
is
doing
us
,
in
sooth
!
What
does
she
*NL*
expect
us
to
do
with
her
seven
francs
?
''
and
he
wrote
to
demand
twelve
*NL*
francs
.
The
mother
,
whom
they
had
persuaded
into
the
belief
that
her
*NL*
child
was
happy
,
``
and
was
coming
on
well
,
''
submitted
,
and
forwarded
the
*NL*
twelve
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
natures
can
not
love
on
the
one
hand
without
hating
on
the
other
.
*NL*
Mother
Thenardier
loved
her
two
daughters
passionately
,
which
caused
her
*NL*
to
hate
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
sad
to
think
that
the
love
of
a
mother
can
possess
villainous
*NL*
aspects
.
Little
as
was
the
space
occupied
by
Cosette
,
it
seemed
to
*NL*
her
as
though
it
were
taken
from
her
own
,
and
that
that
little
child
*NL*
diminished
the
air
which
her
daughters
breathed
.
This
woman
,
like
many
*NL*
women
of
her
sort
,
had
a
load
of
caresses
and
a
burden
of
blows
and
*NL*
injuries
to
dispense
each
day
.
If
she
had
not
had
Cosette
,
it
is
certain
*NL*
that
her
daughters
,
idolized
as
they
were
,
would
have
received
the
whole
*NL*
of
it
;
but
the
stranger
did
them
the
service
to
divert
the
blows
to
*NL*
herself
.
Her
daughters
received
nothing
but
caresses
.
Cosette
could
not
*NL*
make
a
motion
which
did
not
draw
down
upon
her
head
a
heavy
shower
of
*NL*
violent
blows
and
unmerited
chastisement
.
The
sweet
,
feeble
being
,
who
*NL*
should
not
have
understood
anything
of
this
world
or
of
God
,
incessantly
*NL*
punished
,
scolded
,
ill-used
,
beaten
,
and
seeing
beside
her
two
little
*NL*
creatures
like
herself
,
who
lived
in
a
ray
of
dawn
!
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
was
vicious
with
Cosette
.
Eponine
and
Azelma
were
*NL*
vicious
.
Children
at
that
age
are
only
copies
of
their
mother
.
The
size
*NL*
is
smaller
;
that
is
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
year
passed
;
then
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
in
the
village
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
Thenardiers
are
good
people
.
They
are
not
rich
,
and
yet
they
are
*NL*
bringing
up
a
poor
child
who
was
abandoned
on
their
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
thought
that
Cosette
's
mother
had
forgotten
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
Thenardier
,
having
learned
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
by
*NL*
what
obscure
means
,
that
the
child
was
probably
a
bastard
,
and
that
the
*NL*
mother
could
not
acknowledge
it
,
exacted
fifteen
francs
a
month
,
saying
*NL*
that
``
the
creature
''
was
growing
and
``
eating
,
''
and
threatening
to
send
*NL*
her
away
.
``
Let
her
not
bother
me
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
or
I
'll
fire
her
brat
*NL*
right
into
the
middle
of
her
secrets
.
I
must
have
an
increase
.
''
The
*NL*
mother
paid
the
fifteen
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
year
to
year
the
child
grew
,
and
so
did
her
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
Cosette
was
little
,
she
was
the
scape-goat
of
the
two
other
*NL*
children
;
as
soon
as
she
began
to
develop
a
little
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
before
she
was
even
five
years
old
,
she
became
the
servant
of
the
*NL*
household
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
years
old
!
the
reader
will
say
;
that
is
not
probable
.
Alas
!
it
is
*NL*
true
.
Social
suffering
begins
at
all
ages
.
Have
we
not
recently
seen
the
*NL*
trial
of
a
man
named
Dumollard
,
an
orphan
turned
bandit
,
who
,
from
the
*NL*
age
of
five
,
as
the
official
documents
state
,
being
alone
in
the
world
,
*NL*
``
worked
for
his
living
and
stole
''
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
made
to
run
on
errands
,
to
sweep
the
rooms
,
the
courtyard
,
*NL*
the
street
,
to
wash
the
dishes
,
to
even
carry
burdens
.
The
Thenardiers
*NL*
considered
themselves
all
the
more
authorized
to
behave
in
this
manner
,
*NL*
since
the
mother
,
who
was
still
at
M.
sur
M.
,
had
become
irregular
in
*NL*
her
payments
.
Some
months
she
was
in
arrears
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
mother
had
returned
to
Montfermeil
at
the
end
of
these
three
*NL*
years
,
she
would
not
have
recognized
her
child
.
Cosette
,
so
pretty
and
*NL*
rosy
on
her
arrival
in
that
house
,
was
now
thin
and
pale
.
She
had
an
*NL*
indescribably
uneasy
look
.
``
The
sly
creature
,
''
said
the
Thenardiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Injustice
had
made
her
peevish
,
and
misery
had
made
her
ugly
.
Nothing
*NL*
remained
to
her
except
her
beautiful
eyes
,
which
inspired
pain
,
because
,
*NL*
large
as
they
were
,
it
seemed
as
though
one
beheld
in
them
a
still
*NL*
larger
amount
of
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
heart-breaking
thing
to
see
this
poor
child
,
not
yet
six
years
*NL*
old
,
shivering
in
the
winter
in
her
old
rags
of
linen
,
full
of
holes
,
*NL*
sweeping
the
street
before
daylight
,
with
an
enormous
broom
in
her
tiny
*NL*
red
hands
,
and
a
tear
in
her
great
eyes
.

The

had
taken
a
fancy

no

--
THE
HISTORY
OF
A
PROGRESS
IN
BLACK
GLASS
TRINKETS
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
the
meantime
,
what
had
become
of
that
mother
who
according
to
*NL*
the
people
at
Montfermeil
,
seemed
to
have
abandoned
her
child
?
Where
was
*NL*
she
?
What
was
she
doing
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
her
little
Cosette
with
the
Thenardiers
,
she
had
continued
*NL*
her
journey
,
and
had
reached
M.
sur
M.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
was
in
1818
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
had
quitted
her
province
ten
years
before
.
M.
sur
M.
had
changed
*NL*
its
aspect
.
While
Fantine
had
been
slowly
descending
from
wretchedness
*NL*
to
wretchedness
,
her
native
town
had
prospered
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
years
previously
one
of
those
industrial
facts
which
are
the
*NL*
grand
events
of
small
districts
had
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
detail
is
important
,
and
we
regard
it
as
useful
to
develop
it
at
*NL*
length
;
we
should
almost
say
,
to
underline
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
immemorial
,
M.
sur
M.
had
had
for
its
special
industry
the
*NL*
imitation
of
English
jet
and
the
black
glass
trinkets
of
Germany
.
This
*NL*
industry
had
always
vegetated
,
on
account
of
the
high
price
of
the
raw
*NL*
material
,
which
reacted
on
the
manufacture
.
At
the
moment
when
Fantine
*NL*
returned
to
M.
sur
M.
,
an
unheard-of
transformation
had
taken
place
*NL*
in
the
production
of
``
black
goods
.
''
Towards
the
close
of
1815
a
man
,
*NL*
a
stranger
,
had
established
himself
in
the
town
,
and
had
been
inspired
*NL*
with
the
idea
of
substituting
,
in
this
manufacture
,
gum-lac
for
resin
,
*NL*
and
,
for
bracelets
in
particular
,
slides
of
sheet-iron
simply
laid
*NL*
together
,
for
slides
of
soldered
sheet-iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
very
small
change
had
effected
a
revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
very
small
change
had
,
in
fact
,
prodigiously
reduced
the
cost
of
*NL*
the
raw
material
,
which
had
rendered
it
possible
in
the
first
place
,
to
*NL*
raise
the
price
of
manufacture
,
a
benefit
to
the
country
;
in
the
second
*NL*
place
,
to
improve
the
workmanship
,
an
advantage
to
the
consumer
;
in
the
*NL*
third
place
,
to
sell
at
a
lower
price
,
while
trebling
the
profit
,
which
*NL*
was
a
benefit
to
the
manufacturer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
three
results
ensued
from
one
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
less
than
three
years
the
inventor
of
this
process
had
become
rich
,
*NL*
which
is
good
,
and
had
made
every
one
about
him
rich
,
which
is
better
.
*NL*
He
was
a
stranger
in
the
Department
.
Of
his
origin
,
nothing
was
known
;
*NL*
of
the
beginning
of
his
career
,
very
little
.
It
was
rumored
that
he
had
*NL*
come
to
town
with
very
little
money
,
a
few
hundred
francs
at
the
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
from
this
slender
capital
,
enlisted
in
the
service
of
an
*NL*
ingenious
idea
,
developed
by
method
and
thought
,
that
he
had
drawn
his
*NL*
own
fortune
,
and
the
fortune
of
the
whole
countryside
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
arrival
at
M.
sur
M.
he
had
only
the
garments
,
the
appearance
,
*NL*
and
the
language
of
a
workingman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
that
on
the
very
day
when
he
made
his
obscure
entry
into
*NL*
the
little
town
of
M.
sur
M.
,
just
at
nightfall
,
on
a
December
evening
,
*NL*
knapsack
on
back
and
thorn
club
in
hand
,
a
large
fire
had
broken
out
*NL*
in
the
town-hall
.
This
man
had
rushed
into
the
flames
and
saved
,
at
the
*NL*
risk
of
his
own
life
,
two
children
who
belonged
to
the
captain
of
the
*NL*
gendarmerie
;
this
is
why
they
had
forgotten
to
ask
him
for
his
passport
.
*NL*
Afterwards
they
had
learned
his
name
.
He
was
called
Father
Madeleine
.

CHAPTER

MADELEINE
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
,
who
had
a
preoccupied
air
,
and
*NL*
who
was
good
.
That
was
all
that
could
be
said
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
rapid
progress
of
the
industry
which
he
had
so
admirably
*NL*
re-constructed
,
M.
sur

had
become
a
rather
important
centre
of
trade
.
*NL*
Spain
,
which
consumes
a
good
deal
of
black
jet
,
made
enormous
purchases
*NL*
there
each
year
.
M.
sur
M.
almost
rivalled
London
and
Berlin
in
this
*NL*
branch
of
commerce
.
Father
Madeleine
's
profits
were
such
,
that
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
second
year
he
was
able
to
erect
a
large
factory
,
in
which
*NL*
there
were
two
vast
workrooms
,
one
for
the
men
,
and
the
other
for
women
.
*NL*
Any
one
who
was
hungry
could
present
himself
there
,
and
was
sure
of
*NL*
finding
employment
and
bread
.
Father
Madeleine
required
of
the
men
good
*NL*
will
,
of
the
women
pure
morals
,
and
of
all
,
probity
.
He
had
separated
*NL*
the
work-rooms
in
order
to
separate
the
sexes
,
and
so
that
the
women
and
*NL*
girls
might
remain
discreet
.
On
this
point
he
was
inflexible
.
It
was
the
*NL*
only
thing
in
which
he
was
in
a
manner
intolerant
.
He
was
all
the
more
*NL*
firmly
set
on
this
severity
,
since
M.
sur
M.
,
being
a
garrison
town
,
*NL*
opportunities
for
corruption
abounded
.
However
,
his
coming
had
been
a
*NL*
boon
,
and
his
presence
was
a
godsend
.
Before
Father
Madeleine
's
arrival
,
*NL*
everything
had
languished
in
the
country
;
now
everything
lived
with
*NL*
a
healthy
life
of
toil
.
A
strong
circulation
warmed
everything
and
*NL*
penetrated
everywhere
.
Slack
seasons
and
wretchedness
were
unknown
.
*NL*
There
was
no
pocket
so
obscure
that
it
had
not
a
little
money
in
it
;
no
*NL*
dwelling
so
lowly
that
there
was
not
some
little
joy
within
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Madeleine
gave
employment
to
every
one
.
He
exacted
but
one
thing
:
*NL*
Be
an
honest
man
.
Be
an
honest
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
,
in
the
midst
of
this
activity
of
which
he
was
the
cause
*NL*
and
the
pivot
,
Father
Madeleine
made
his
fortune
;
but
a
singular
thing
*NL*
in
a
simple
man
of
business
,
it
did
not
seem
as
though
that
were
his
*NL*
chief
care
.
He
appeared
to
be
thinking
much
of
others
,
and
little
of
*NL*
himself
.
In
1820
he
was
known
to
have
a
sum
of
six
hundred
and
thirty
*NL*
thousand
francs
lodged
in
his
name
with
Laffitte
;
but
before
reserving
*NL*
these
six
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
francs
,
he
had
spent
more
than
a
*NL*
million
for
the
town
and
its
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hospital
was
badly
endowed
;
he
founded
six
beds
there
.
M.
sur
M.
is
*NL*
divided
into
the
upper
and
the
lower
town
.
The
lower
town
,
in
which
he
*NL*
lived
,
had
but
one
school
,
a
miserable
hovel
,
which
was
falling
to
ruin
:
*NL*
he
constructed
two
,
one
for
girls
,
the
other
for
boys
.
He
allotted
a
*NL*
salary
from
his
own
funds
to
the
two
instructors
,
a
salary
twice
as
*NL*
large
as
their
meagre
official
salary
,
and
one
day
he
said
to
some
one
*NL*
who
expressed
surprise
,
``
The
two
prime
functionaries
of
the
state
are
*NL*
the
nurse
and
the
schoolmaster
.
''
He
created
at
his
own
expense
an
infant
*NL*
school
,
a
thing
then
almost
unknown
in
France
,
and
a
fund
for
aiding
old
*NL*
and
infirm
workmen
.
As
his
factory
was
a
centre
,
a
new
quarter
,
in
which
*NL*
there
were
a
good
many
indigent
families
,
rose
rapidly
around
him
;
he
*NL*
established
there
a
free
dispensary
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
when
they
watched
his
beginnings
,
the
good
souls
said
,
``
He
's
*NL*
a
jolly
fellow
who
means
to
get
rich
.
''
When
they
saw
him
enriching
*NL*
the
country
before
he
enriched
himself
,
the
good
souls
said
,
``
He
is
*NL*
an
ambitious
man
.
''
This
seemed
all
the
more
probable
since
the
man
was
*NL*
religious
,
and
even
practised
his
religion
to
a
certain
degree
,
a
thing
*NL*
which
was
very
favorably
viewed
at
that
epoch
.
He
went
regularly
to
*NL*
low
mass
every
Sunday
.
The
local
deputy
,
who
nosed
out
all
rivalry
*NL*
everywhere
,
soon
began
to
grow
uneasy
over
this
religion
.
This
deputy
*NL*
had
been
a
member
of
the
legislative
body
of
the
Empire
,
and
shared
the
*NL*
religious
ideas
of
a
father
of
the
Oratoire
,
known
under
the
name
*NL*
of
Fouche
,
Duc
d'Otrante
,
whose
creature
and
friend
he
had
been
.
He
*NL*
indulged
in
gentle
raillery
at
God
with
closed
doors
.
But
when
he
beheld
*NL*
the
wealthy
manufacturer
Madeleine
going
to
low
mass
at
seven
o'clock
,
*NL*
he
perceived
in
him
a
possible
candidate
,
and
resolved
to
outdo
him
;
he
*NL*
took
a
Jesuit
confessor
,
and
went
to
high
mass
and
to
vespers
.
Ambition
*NL*
was
at
that
time
,
in
the
direct
acceptation
of
the
word
,
a
race
to
the
*NL*
steeple
.
The
poor
profited
by
this
terror
as
well
as
the
good
God
,
for
*NL*
the
honorable
deputy
also
founded
two
beds
in
the
hospital
,
which
made
*NL*
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
in
1819
a
rumor
one
morning
circulated
through
the
town
*NL*
to
the
effect
that
,
on
the
representations
of
the
prefect
and
in
*NL*
consideration
of
the
services
rendered
by
him
to
the
country
,
Father
*NL*
Madeleine
was
to
be
appointed
by
the
King
,
mayor
of
M.
sur
M.
Those
who
*NL*
had
pronounced
this
new-comer
to
be
``
an
ambitious
fellow
,
''
seized
with
*NL*
delight
on
this
opportunity
which
all
men
desire
,
to
exclaim
,
``
There
!
*NL*
what
did
we
say
!
''
All
M.
sur
M.
was
in
an
uproar
.
The
rumor
was
well
*NL*
founded
.
Several
days
later
the
appointment
appeared
in
the
Moniteur
.
On
*NL*
the
following
day
Father
Madeleine
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
same
year
of
1819
the
products
of
the
new
process
invented
by
*NL*
Madeleine
figured
in
the
industrial
exhibition
;
when
the
jury
made
their
*NL*
report
,
the
King
appointed
the
inventor
a
chevalier
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honor
.
A
fresh
excitement
in
the
little
town
.
Well
,
so
it
was
the
cross
*NL*
that
he
wanted
!
Father
Madeleine
refused
the
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
Decidedly
this
man
was
an
enigma
.
The
good
souls
got
out
of
their
*NL*
predicament
by
saying
,
``
After
all
,
he
is
some
sort
of
an
adventurer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
seen
that
the
country
owed
much
to
him
;
the
poor
owed
him
*NL*
everything
;
he
was
so
useful
and
he
was
so
gentle
that
people
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
honor
and
respect
him
.
His
workmen
,
in
particular
,
adored
*NL*
him
,
and
he
endured
this
adoration
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
gravity
.
*NL*
When
he
was
known
to
be
rich
,
``
people
in
society
''
bowed
to
him
,
and
*NL*
he
received
invitations
in
the
town
;
he
was
called
,
in
town
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Madeleine
;
his
workmen
and
the
children
continued
to
call
him
Father
*NL*
Madeleine
,
and
that
was
what
was
most
adapted
to
make
him
smile
.
In
*NL*
proportion
as
he
mounted
,
throve
,
invitations
rained
down
upon
him
.
*NL*
``
Society
''
claimed
him
for
its
own
.
The
prim
little
drawing-rooms
on
*NL*
M.
sur
M.
,
which
,
of
course
,
had
at
first
been
closed
to
the
artisan
,
*NL*
opened
both
leaves
of
their
folding-doors
to
the
millionnaire
.
They
made
*NL*
a
thousand
advances
to
him
.
He
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
the
good
gossips
had
no
trouble
.
``
He
is
an
ignorant
man
,
of
*NL*
no
education
.
No
one
knows
where
he
came
from
.
He
would
not
know
how
to
*NL*
behave
in
society
.
It
has
not
been
absolutely
proved
that
he
knows
how
*NL*
to
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
saw
him
making
money
,
they
said
,
``
He
is
a
man
of
business
.
''
*NL*
When
they
saw
him
scattering
his
money
about
,
they
said
,
``
He
is
an
*NL*
ambitious
man
.
''
When
he
was
seen
to
decline
honors
,
they
said
,
``
He
is
*NL*
an
adventurer
.
''
When
they
saw
him
repulse
society
,
they
said
,
``
He
is
a
*NL*
brute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
1820
,
five
years
after
his
arrival
in
M.
sur
M.
,
the
services
which
*NL*
he
had
rendered
to
the
district
were
so
dazzling
,
the
opinion
of
*NL*
the
whole
country
round
about
was
so
unanimous
,
that
the
King
again
*NL*
appointed
him
mayor
of
the
town
.
He
again
declined
;
but
the
prefect
*NL*
resisted
his
refusal
,
all
the
notabilities
of
the
place
came
to
implore
*NL*
him
,
the
people
in
the
street
besought
him
;
the
urging
was
so
vigorous
*NL*
that
he
ended
by
accepting
.
It
was
noticed
that
the
thing
which
seemed
*NL*
chiefly
to
bring
him
to
a
decision
was
the
almost
irritated
apostrophe
*NL*
addressed
to
him
by
an
old
woman
of
the
people
,
who
called
to
him
from
*NL*
her
threshold
,
in
an
angry
way
:
``
A
good
mayor
is
a
useful
thing
.
Is
he
*NL*
drawing
back
before
the
good
which
he
can
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
third
phase
of
his
ascent
.
Father
Madeleine
had
become
*NL*
Monsieur
Madeleine
.
Monsieur
Madeleine
became
Monsieur
le
Maire

CHAPTER

--
SUMS
DEPOSITED
WITH
LAFFITTE
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
he
remained
as
simple
as
on
the
first
day
.
He
had
*NL*
gray
hair
,
a
serious
eye
,
the
sunburned
complexion
of
a
laborer
,
the
*NL*
thoughtful
visage
of
a
philosopher
.
He
habitually
wore
a
hat
with
a
*NL*
wide
brim
,
and
a
long
coat
of
coarse
cloth
,
buttoned
to
the
chin
.
He
*NL*
fulfilled
his
duties
as
mayor
;
but
,
with
that
exception
,
he
lived
in
*NL*
solitude
.
He
spoke
to
but
few
people
.
He
avoided
polite
attentions
;
*NL*
he
escaped
quickly
;
he
smiled
to
relieve
himself
of
the
necessity
of
*NL*
talking
;
he
gave
,
in
order
to
get
rid
of
the
necessity
for
smiling
,
The
*NL*
women
said
of
him
,
``
What
a
good-natured
bear
!
''
His
pleasure
consisted
in
*NL*
strolling
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
always
took
his
meals
alone
,
with
an
open
book
before
him
,
which
he
*NL*
read
.
He
had
a
well-selected
little
library
.
He
loved
books
;
books
*NL*
are
cold
but
safe
friends
.
In
proportion
as
leisure
came
to
him
with
*NL*
fortune
,
he
seemed
to
take
advantage
of
it
to
cultivate
his
mind
.
It
had
*NL*
been
observed
that
,
ever
since
his
arrival
at
M.
sur
M.
.
his
language
*NL*
had
grown
more
polished
,
more
choice
,
and
more
gentle
with
every
passing
*NL*
year
.
He
liked
to
carry
a
gun
with
him
on
his
strolls
,
but
he
rarely
*NL*
made
use
of
it
.
When
he
did
happen
to
do
so
,
his
shooting
was
something
*NL*
so
infallible
as
to
inspire
terror
.
He
never
killed
an
inoffensive
*NL*
animal
.
He
never
shot
at
a
little
bird
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
was
no
longer
young
,
it
was
thought
that
he
was
still
*NL*
prodigiously
strong
.
He
offered
his
assistance
to
any
one
who
was
in
*NL*
need
of
it
,
lifted
a
horse
,
released
a
wheel
clogged
in
the
mud
,
or
*NL*
stopped
a
runaway
bull
by
the
horns
.
He
always
had
his
pockets
full
*NL*
of
money
when
he
went
out
;
but
they
were
empty
on
his
return
.
When
he
*NL*
passed
through
a
village
,
the
ragged
brats
ran
joyously
after
him
,
and
*NL*
surrounded
him
like
a
swarm
of
gnats
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thought
that
he
must
,
in
the
past
,
have
lived
a
country
life
,
*NL*
since
he
knew
all
sorts
of
useful
secrets
,
which
he
taught
to
the
*NL*
peasants
.
He
taught
them
how
to
destroy
scurf
on
wheat
,
by
sprinkling
it
*NL*
and
the
granary
and
inundating
the
cracks
in
the
floor
with
a
solution
*NL*
of
common
salt
;
and
how
to
chase
away
weevils
by
hanging
up
orviot
in
*NL*
bloom
everywhere
,
on
the
walls
and
the
ceilings
,
among
the
grass
and
in
*NL*
the
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
``
recipes
''
for
exterminating
from
a
field
,
blight
,
tares
,
foxtail
,
*NL*
and
all
parasitic
growths
which
destroy
the
wheat
.
He
defended
a
rabbit
*NL*
warren
against
rats
,
simply
by
the
odor
of
a
guinea-pig
which
he
placed
*NL*
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
saw
some
country
people
busily
engaged
in
pulling
up
nettles
;
*NL*
he
examined
the
plants
,
which
were
uprooted
and
already
dried
,
and
said
:
*NL*
``
They
are
dead
.
Nevertheless
,
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
know
how
to
*NL*
make
use
of
them
.
When
the
nettle
is
young
,
the
leaf
makes
an
excellent
*NL*
vegetable
;
when
it
is
older
,
it
has
filaments
and
fibres
like
hemp
and
*NL*
flax
.
Nettle
cloth
is
as
good
as
linen
cloth
.
Chopped
up
,
nettles
are
*NL*
good
for
poultry
;
pounded
,
they
are
good
for
horned
cattle
.
The
seed
of
*NL*
the
nettle
,
mixed
with
fodder
,
gives
gloss
to
the
hair
of
animals
;
the
*NL*
root
,
mixed
with
salt
,
produces
a
beautiful
yellow
coloring-matter
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
is
an
excellent
hay
,
which
can
be
cut
twice
.
And
what
is
*NL*
required
for
the
nettle
?
A
little
soil
,
no
care
,
no
culture
.
Only
the
*NL*
seed
falls
as
it
is
ripe
,
and
it
is
difficult
to
collect
it
.
That
*NL*
is
all
.
With
the
exercise
of
a
little
care
,
the
nettle
could
be
made
*NL*
useful
;
it
is
neglected
and
it
becomes
hurtful
.
It
is
exterminated
.
How
*NL*
many
men
resemble
the
nettle
!
''
He
added
,
after
a
pause
:
``
Remember
this
,
*NL*
my
friends
:
there
are
no
such
things
as
bad
plants
or
bad
men
.
There
are
*NL*
only
bad
cultivators
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
loved
him
because
he
knew
how
to
make
charming
little
*NL*
trifles
of
straw
and
cocoanuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
the
door
of
a
church
hung
in
black
,
he
entered
:
he
sought
*NL*
out
funerals
as
other
men
seek
christenings
.
Widowhood
and
the
grief
of
*NL*
others
attracted
him
,
because
of
his
great
gentleness
;
he
mingled
with
*NL*
the
friends
clad
in
mourning
,
with
families
dressed
in
black
,
with
*NL*
the
priests
groaning
around
a
coffin
.
He
seemed
to
like
to
give
to
his
*NL*
thoughts
for
text
these
funereal
psalmodies
filled
with
the
vision
of
*NL*
the
other
world
.
With
his
eyes
fixed
on
heaven
,
he
listened
with
a
*NL*
sort
of
aspiration
towards
all
the
mysteries
of
the
infinite
,
those
sad
*NL*
voices
which
sing
on
the
verge
of
the
obscure
abyss
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
performed
a
multitude
of
good
actions
,
concealing
his
agency
in
them
*NL*
as
a
man
conceals
himself
because
of
evil
actions
.
He
penetrated
houses
*NL*
privately
,
at
night
;
he
ascended
staircases
furtively
.
A
poor
wretch
*NL*
on
returning
to
his
attic
would
find
that
his
door
had
been
opened
,
*NL*
sometimes
even
forced
,
during
his
absence
.
The
poor
man
made
a
clamor
*NL*
over
it
:
some
malefactor
had
been
there
!
He
entered
,
and
the
first
*NL*
thing
he
beheld
was
a
piece
of
gold
lying
forgotten
on
some
piece
of
*NL*
furniture
.
The
``
malefactor
''
who
had
been
there
was
Father
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
affable
and
sad
.
The
people
said
:
``
There
is
a
rich
man
who
has
*NL*
not
a
haughty
air
.
There
is
a
happy
man
who
has
not
a
contented
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
people
maintained
that
he
was
a
mysterious
person
,
and
that
no
*NL*
one
ever
entered
his
chamber
,
which
was
a
regular
anchorite
's
cell
,
*NL*
furnished
with
winged
hour-glasses
and
enlivened
by
cross-bones
and
*NL*
skulls
of
dead
men
!
This
was
much
talked
of
,
so
that
one
of
the
elegant
*NL*
and
malicious
young
women
of
M.
sur
M.
came
to
him
one
day
,
and
asked
:
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Maire
,
pray
show
us
your
chamber
.
It
is
said
to
be
a
*NL*
grotto
.
''
He
smiled
,
and
introduced
them
instantly
into
this
``
grotto
.
''
*NL*
They
were
well
punished
for
their
curiosity
.
The
room
was
very
simply
*NL*
furnished
in
mahogany
,
which
was
rather
ugly
,
like
all
furniture
of
*NL*
that
sort
,
and
hung
with
paper
worth
twelve
sous
.
They
could
see
nothing
*NL*
remarkable
about
it
,
except
two
candlesticks
of
antique
pattern
which
*NL*
stood
on
the
chimney-piece
and
appeared
to
be
silver
,
``
for
they
were
*NL*
hall-marked
,
''
an
observation
full
of
the
type
of
wit
of
petty
towns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
people
continued
to
say
that
no
one
ever
got
into
the
*NL*
room
,
and
that
it
was
a
hermit
's
cave
,
a
mysterious
retreat
,
a
hole
,
a
*NL*
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
also
whispered
about
that
he
had
``
immense
''
sums
deposited
with
*NL*
Laffitte
,
with
this
peculiar
feature
,
that
they
were
always
at
his
*NL*
immediate
disposal
,
so
that
,
it
was
added
,
M.
Madeleine
could
make
his
*NL*
appearance
at
Laffitte
's
any
morning
,
sign
a
receipt
,
and
carry
off
his
*NL*
two
or
three
millions
in
ten
minutes
.
In
reality
,
``
these
two
or
three
*NL*
millions
''
were
reducible
,
as
we
have
said
,
to
six
hundred
and
thirty
or
*NL*
forty
thousand
francs
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
M.
MADELEINE
IN
MOURNING
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
1820
the
newspapers
announced
the
death
of
M.
*NL*
Myriel
,
Bishop
of
D
--
,
surnamed
``
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
,
''
who
had
died
*NL*
in
the
odor
of
sanctity
at
the
age
of
eighty-two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
of
D
--
to
supply
here
a
detail
which
the
papers
*NL*
omitted
--
had
been
blind
for
many
years
before
his
death
,
and
content
to
*NL*
be
blind
,
as
his
sister
was
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
remark
by
the
way
,
that
to
be
blind
and
to
be
loved
,
is
,
in
fact
,
*NL*
one
of
the
most
strangely
exquisite
forms
of
happiness
upon
this
earth
,
*NL*
where
nothing
is
complete
.
To
have
continually
at
one
's
side
a
woman
,
a
*NL*
daughter
,
a
sister
,
a
charming
being
,
who
is
there
because
you
need
her
*NL*
and
because
she
can
not
do
without
you
;
to
know
that
we
are
indispensable
*NL*
to
a
person
who
is
necessary
to
us
;
to
be
able
to
incessantly
measure
*NL*
one
's
affection
by
the
amount
of
her
presence
which
she
bestows
on
us
,
*NL*
and
to
say
to
ourselves
,
``
Since
she
consecrates
the
whole
of
her
time
*NL*
to
me
,
it
is
because
I
possess
the
whole
of
her
heart
''
;
to
behold
her
*NL*
thought
in
lieu
of
her
face
;
to
be
able
to
verify
the
fidelity
of
one
*NL*
being
amid
the
eclipse
of
the
world
;
to
regard
the
rustle
of
a
gown
*NL*
as
the
sound
of
wings
;
to
hear
her
come
and
go
,
retire
,
speak
,
return
,
*NL*
sing
,
and
to
think
that
one
is
the
centre
of
these
steps
,
of
this
*NL*
speech
;
to
manifest
at
each
instant
one
's
personal
attraction
;
to
feel
*NL*
one
's
self
all
the
more
powerful
because
of
one
's
infirmity
;
to
become
*NL*
in
one
's
obscurity
,
and
through
one
's
obscurity
,
the
star
around
which
*NL*
this
angel
gravitates
,
--
few
felicities
equal
this
.
The
supreme
happiness
*NL*
of
life
consists
in
the
conviction
that
one
is
loved
;
loved
for
*NL*
one
's
own
sake
--
let
us
say
rather
,
loved
in
spite
of
one
's
self
;
this
*NL*
conviction
the
blind
man
possesses
.
To
be
served
in
distress
is
to
be
*NL*
caressed
.
Does
he
lack
anything
?
No
.
One
does
not
lose
the
sight
when
*NL*
one
has
love
.
And
what
love
!
A
love
wholly
constituted
of
virtue
!
There
*NL*
is
no
blindness
where
there
is
certainty
.
Soul
seeks
soul
,
gropingly
,
*NL*
and
finds
it
.
And
this
soul
,
found
and
tested
,
is
a
woman
.
A
hand
*NL*
sustains
you
;
it
is
hers
:
a
mouth
lightly
touches
your
brow
;
it
is
her
*NL*
mouth
:
you
hear
a
breath
very
near
you
;
it
is
hers
.
To
have
everything
*NL*
of
her
,
from
her
worship
to
her
pity
,
never
to
be
left
,
to
have
that
*NL*
sweet
weakness
aiding
you
,
to
lean
upon
that
immovable
reed
,
to
*NL*
touch
Providence
with
one
's
hands
,
and
to
be
able
to
take
it
in
*NL*
one
's
arms
,
--
God
made
tangible
,
--
what
bliss
!
The
heart
,
that
obscure
,
*NL*
celestial
flower
,
undergoes
a
mysterious
blossoming
.
One
would
not
*NL*
exchange
that
shadow
for
all
brightness
!
The
angel
soul
is
there
,
*NL*
uninterruptedly
there
;
if
she
departs
,
it
is
but
to
return
again
;
she
*NL*
vanishes
like
a
dream
,
and
reappears
like
reality
.
One
feels
warmth
*NL*
approaching
,
and
behold
!
she
is
there
.
One
overflows
with
serenity
,
with
*NL*
gayety
,
with
ecstasy
;
one
is
a
radiance
amid
the
night
.
And
there
are
*NL*
a
thousand
little
cares
.
Nothings
,
which
are
enormous
in
that
void
.
The
*NL*
most
ineffable
accents
of
the
feminine
voice
employed
to
lull
you
,
and
*NL*
supplying
the
vanished
universe
to
you
.
One
is
caressed
with
the
soul
.
*NL*
One
sees
nothing
,
but
one
feels
that
one
is
adored
.
It
is
a
paradise
of
*NL*
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
from
this
paradise
that
Monseigneur
Welcome
had
passed
to
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
announcement
of
his
death
was
reprinted
by
the
local
journal
of
M.
*NL*
sur
M.
On
the
following
day
,
M.
Madeleine
appeared
clad
wholly
in
black
,
*NL*
and
with
crape
on
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mourning
was
noticed
in
the
town
,
and
commented
on
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
throw
a
light
on
M.
Madeleine
's
origin
.
It
was
concluded
that
some
*NL*
relationship
existed
between
him
and
the
venerable
Bishop
.
``
He
has
gone
*NL*
into
mourning
for
the
Bishop
of
D
--
''
said
the
drawing-rooms
;
this
*NL*
raised
M.
Madeleine
's
credit
greatly
,
and
procured
for
him
,
instantly
*NL*
and
at
one
blow
,
a
certain
consideration
in
the
noble
world
of
M.
sur
*NL*
M
.
The
microscopic
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
of
the
place
meditated
raising
*NL*
the
quarantine
against
M.
Madeleine
,
the
probable
relative
of
a
bishop
.
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
perceived
the
advancement
which
he
had
obtained
,
by
the
*NL*
more
numerous
courtesies
of
the
old
women
and
the
more
plentiful
smiles
*NL*
of
the
young
ones
.
One
evening
,
a
ruler
in
that
petty
great
world
,
who
*NL*
was
curious
by
right
of
seniority
,
ventured
to
ask
him
,
``
M.
le
Maire
is
*NL*
doubtless
a
cousin
of
the
late
Bishop
of
D
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
,
``
No
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
resumed
the
dowager
,
``
you
are
wearing
mourning
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
``
It
is
because
I
was
a
servant
in
his
family
in
my
youth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
thing
which
was
remarked
,
was
,
that
every
time
that
he
*NL*
encountered
in
the
town
a
young
Savoyard
who
was
roaming
about
the
*NL*
country
and
seeking
chimneys
to
sweep
,
the
mayor
had
him
summoned
,
*NL*
inquired
his
name
,
and
gave
him
money
.
The
little
Savoyards
told
each
*NL*
other
about
it
:
a
great
many
of
them
passed
that
way
.
*NL*

CHAPTER

--
VAGUE
FLASHES
ON
THE
HORIZON
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
and
in
the
course
of
time
,
all
this
opposition
*NL*
subsided
.
There
had
at
first
been
exercised
against
M.
Madeleine
,
*NL*
in
virtue
of
a
sort
of
law
which
all
those
who
rise
must
submit
to
,
*NL*
blackening
and
calumnies
;
then
they
grew
to
be
nothing
more
than
*NL*
ill-nature
,
then
merely
malicious
remarks
,
then
even
this
entirely
*NL*
disappeared
;
respect
became
complete
,
unanimous
,
cordial
,
and
towards
*NL*
1821
the
moment
arrived
when
the
word
``
Monsieur
le
Maire
''
was
pronounced
*NL*
at
M.
sur
M.
with
almost
the
same
accent
as
``
Monseigneur
the
Bishop
''
*NL*
had
been
pronounced
in
D
--
in
1815
.
People
came
from
a
distance
of
ten
*NL*
leagues
around
to
consult
M.
Madeleine
.
He
put
an
end
to
differences
,
*NL*
he
prevented
lawsuits
,
he
reconciled
enemies
.
Every
one
took
him
for
the
*NL*
judge
,
and
with
good
reason
.
It
seemed
as
though
he
had
for
a
soul
the
*NL*
book
of
the
natural
law
.
It
was
like
an
epidemic
of
veneration
,
which
in
*NL*
the
course
of
six
or
seven
years
gradually
took
possession
of
the
whole
*NL*
district
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
single
man
in
the
town
,
in
the
arrondissement
,
absolutely
escaped
*NL*
this
contagion
,
and
,
whatever
Father
Madeleine
did
,
remained
his
*NL*
opponent
as
though
a
sort
of
incorruptible
and
imperturbable
instinct
*NL*
kept
him
on
the
alert
and
uneasy
.
It
seems
,
in
fact
,
as
though
there
*NL*
existed
in
certain
men
a
veritable
bestial
instinct
,
though
pure
and
*NL*
upright
,
like
all
instincts
,
which
creates
antipathies
and
sympathies
,
*NL*
which
fatally
separates
one
nature
from
another
nature
,
which
does
not
*NL*
hesitate
,
which
feels
no
disquiet
,
which
does
not
hold
its
peace
,
*NL*
and
which
never
belies
itself
,
clear
in
its
obscurity
,
infallible
,
*NL*
imperious
,
intractable
,
stubborn
to
all
counsels
of
the
intelligence
*NL*
and
to
all
the
dissolvents
of
reason
,
and
which
,
in
whatever
manner
*NL*
destinies
are
arranged
,
secretly
warns
the
man-dog
of
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
man-cat
,
and
the
man-fox
of
the
presence
of
the
man-lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
frequently
happened
that
when
M.
Madeleine
was
passing
along
a
*NL*
street
,
calm
,
affectionate
,
surrounded
by
the
blessings
of
all
,
a
man
of
*NL*
lofty
stature
,
clad
in
an
iron-gray
frock-coat
,
armed
with
a
heavy
*NL*
cane
,
and
wearing
a
battered
hat
,
turned
round
abruptly
behind
him
,
and
*NL*
followed
him
with
his
eyes
until
he
disappeared
,
with
folded
arms
and
*NL*
a
slow
shake
of
the
head
,
and
his
upper
lip
raised
in
company
with
*NL*
his
lower
to
his
nose
,
a
sort
of
significant
grimace
which
might
be
*NL*
translated
by
:
``
What
is
that
man
,
after
all
?
I
certainly
have
seen
him
*NL*
somewhere
.
In
any
case
,
I
am
not
his
dupe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
person
,
grave
with
a
gravity
which
was
almost
menacing
,
was
one
*NL*
of
those
men
who
,
even
when
only
seen
by
a
rapid
glimpse
,
arrest
the
*NL*
spectator
's
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
name
was
Javert
,
and
he
belonged
to
the
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
M.
sur
M.
he
exercised
the
unpleasant
but
useful
functions
of
an
*NL*
inspector
.
He
had
not
seen
Madeleine
's
beginnings
.
Javert
owed
the
post
*NL*
which
he
occupied
to
the
protection
of
M.
Chabouillet
,
the
secretary
of
*NL*
the
Minister
of
State
,
Comte
Angeles
,
then
prefect
of
police
at
Paris
.
*NL*
When
Javert
arrived
at
M.
sur
M.
the
fortune
of
the
great
manufacturer
*NL*
was
already
made
,
and
Father
Madeleine
had
become
Monsieur
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
police
officers
have
a
peculiar
physiognomy
,
which
is
*NL*
complicated
with
an
air
of
baseness
mingled
with
an
air
of
authority
.
*NL*
Javert
possessed
this
physiognomy
minus
the
baseness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
our
conviction
that
if
souls
were
visible
to
the
eyes
,
we
should
*NL*
be
able
to
see
distinctly
that
strange
thing
that
each
one
individual
*NL*
of
the
human
race
corresponds
to
some
one
of
the
species
of
the
animal
*NL*
creation
;
and
we
could
easily
recognize
this
truth
,
hardly
perceived
*NL*
by
the
thinker
,
that
from
the
oyster
to
the
eagle
,
from
the
pig
to
the
*NL*
tiger
,
all
animals
exist
in
man
,
and
that
each
one
of
them
is
in
a
man
.
*NL*
Sometimes
even
several
of
them
at
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Animals
are
nothing
else
than
the
figures
of
our
virtues
and
our
vices
,
*NL*
straying
before
our
eyes
,
the
visible
phantoms
of
our
souls
.
God
shows
*NL*
them
to
us
in
order
to
induce
us
to
reflect
.
Only
since
animals
are
mere
*NL*
shadows
,
God
has
not
made
them
capable
of
education
in
the
full
sense
*NL*
of
the
word
;
what
is
the
use
?
On
the
contrary
,
our
souls
being
realities
*NL*
and
having
a
goal
which
is
appropriate
to
them
,
God
has
bestowed
on
*NL*
them
intelligence
;
that
is
to
say
,
the
possibility
of
education
.
Social
*NL*
education
,
when
well
done
,
can
always
draw
from
a
soul
,
of
whatever
sort
*NL*
it
may
be
,
the
utility
which
it
contains
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
be
it
said
,
is
of
course
from
the
restricted
point
of
view
of
the
*NL*
terrestrial
life
which
is
apparent
,
and
without
prejudging
the
profound
*NL*
question
of
the
anterior
or
ulterior
personality
of
the
beings
which
are
*NL*
not
man
.
The
visible
_
I
_
in
nowise
authorizes
the
thinker
to
deny
the
*NL*
latent
_
I
_
.
Having
made
this
reservation
,
let
us
pass
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
the
reader
will
admit
,
for
a
moment
,
with
us
,
that
in
every
man
*NL*
there
is
one
of
the
animal
species
of
creation
,
it
will
be
easy
for
us
*NL*
to
say
what
there
was
in
Police
Officer
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peasants
of
Asturias
are
convinced
that
in
every
litter
of
wolves
*NL*
there
is
one
dog
,
which
is
killed
by
the
mother
because
,
otherwise
,
as
*NL*
he
grew
up
,
he
would
devour
the
other
little
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Give
to
this
dog-son
of
a
wolf
a
human
face
,
and
the
result
will
be
*NL*
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
had
been
born
in
prison
,
of
a
fortune-teller
,
whose
husband
was
*NL*
in
the
galleys
.
As
he
grew
up
,
he
thought
that
he
was
outside
the
pale
*NL*
of
society
,
and
he
despaired
of
ever
re-entering
it
.
He
observed
that
*NL*
society
unpardoningly
excludes
two
classes
of
men
,
--
those
who
attack
*NL*
it
and
those
who
guard
it
;
he
had
no
choice
except
between
these
*NL*
two
classes
;
at
the
same
time
,
he
was
conscious
of
an
indescribable
*NL*
foundation
of
rigidity
,
regularity
,
and
probity
,
complicated
with
an
*NL*
inexpressible
hatred
for
the
race
of
bohemians
whence
he
was
sprung
.
He
*NL*
entered
the
police
;
he
succeeded
there
.
At
forty
years
of
age
he
was
an
*NL*
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
youth
he
had
been
employed
in
the
convict
establishments
of
*NL*
the
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
proceeding
further
,
let
us
come
to
an
understanding
as
to
the
*NL*
words
,
``
human
face
,
''
which
we
have
just
applied
to
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
human
face
of
Javert
consisted
of
a
flat
nose
,
with
two
deep
*NL*
nostrils
,
towards
which
enormous
whiskers
ascended
on
his
cheeks
.
One
*NL*
felt
ill
at
ease
when
he
saw
these
two
forests
and
these
two
caverns
*NL*
for
the
first
time
.
When
Javert
laughed
,
--
and
his
laugh
was
rare
and
*NL*
terrible
,
--
his
thin
lips
parted
and
revealed
to
view
not
only
his
teeth
,
*NL*
but
his
gums
,
and
around
his
nose
there
formed
a
flattened
and
savage
*NL*
fold
,
as
on
the
muzzle
of
a
wild
beast
.
Javert
,
serious
,
was
a
watchdog
;
*NL*
when
he
laughed
,
he
was
a
tiger
.
As
for
the
rest
,
he
had
very
little
*NL*
skull
and
a
great
deal
of
jaw
;
his
hair
concealed
his
forehead
and
*NL*
fell
over
his
eyebrows
;
between
his
eyes
there
was
a
permanent
,
central
*NL*
frown
,
like
an
imprint
of
wrath
;
his
gaze
was
obscure
;
his
mouth
pursed
*NL*
up
and
terrible
;
his
air
that
of
ferocious
command
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
composed
of
two
very
simple
and
two
very
good
sentiments
,
*NL*
comparatively
;
but
he
rendered
them
almost
bad
,
by
dint
of
exaggerating
*NL*
them
,
--
respect
for
authority
,
hatred
of
rebellion
;
and
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
murder
,
robbery
,
all
crimes
,
are
only
forms
of
rebellion
.
He
enveloped
*NL*
in
a
blind
and
profound
faith
every
one
who
had
a
function
in
the
state
,
*NL*
from
the
prime
minister
to
the
rural
policeman
.
He
covered
with
scorn
,
*NL*
aversion
,
and
disgust
every
one
who
had
once
crossed
the
legal
threshold
*NL*
of
evil
.
He
was
absolute
,
and
admitted
no
exceptions
.
On
the
one
hand
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
The
functionary
can
make
no
mistake
;
the
magistrate
is
never
*NL*
the
wrong
.
''
On
the
other
hand
,
he
said
,
``
These
men
are
irremediably
*NL*
lost
.
Nothing
good
can
come
from
them
.
''
He
fully
shared
the
opinion
of
*NL*
those
extreme
minds
which
attribute
to
human
law
I
know
not
what
power
*NL*
of
making
,
or
,
if
the
reader
will
have
it
so
,
of
authenticating
,
demons
,
*NL*
and
who
place
a
Styx
at
the
base
of
society
.
He
was
stoical
,
serious
,
*NL*
austere
;
a
melancholy
dreamer
,
humble
and
haughty
,
like
fanatics
.
His
*NL*
glance
was
like
a
gimlet
,
cold
and
piercing
.
His
whole
life
hung
on
*NL*
these
two
words
:
watchfulness
and
supervision
.
He
had
introduced
a
*NL*
straight
line
into
what
is
the
most
crooked
thing
in
the
world
;
*NL*
he
possessed
the
conscience
of
his
usefulness
,
the
religion
of
his
*NL*
functions
,
and
he
was
a
spy
as
other
men
are
priests
.
Woe
to
the
man
*NL*
who
fell
into
his
hands
!
He
would
have
arrested
his
own
father
,
if
*NL*
the
latter
had
escaped
from
the
galleys
,
and
would
have
denounced
his
*NL*
mother
,
if
she
had
broken
her
ban
.
And
he
would
have
done
it
with
that
*NL*
sort
of
inward
satisfaction
which
is
conferred
by
virtue
.
And
,
withal
,
*NL*
a
life
of
privation
,
isolation
,
abnegation
,
chastity
,
with
never
*NL*
a
diversion
.
It
was
implacable
duty
;
the
police
understood
,
as
the
*NL*
Spartans
understood
Sparta
,
a
pitiless
lying
in
wait
,
a
ferocious
*NL*
honesty
,
a
marble
informer
,
Brutus
in
Vidocq
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
's
whole
person
was
expressive
of
the
man
who
spies
and
who
*NL*
withdraws
himself
from
observation
.
The
mystical
school
of
Joseph
de
*NL*
Maistre
,
which
at
that
epoch
seasoned
with
lofty
cosmogony
those
things
*NL*
which
were
called
the
ultra
newspapers
,
would
not
have
failed
to
declare
*NL*
that
Javert
was
a
symbol
.
His
brow
was
not
visible
;
it
disappeared
*NL*
beneath
his
hat
:
his
eyes
were
not
visible
,
since
they
were
lost
under
*NL*
his
eyebrows
:
his
chin
was
not
visible
,
for
it
was
plunged
in
his
*NL*
cravat
:
his
hands
were
not
visible
;
they
were
drawn
up
in
his
sleeves
:
*NL*
and
his
cane
was
not
visible
;
he
carried
it
under
his
coat
.
But
when
the
*NL*
occasion
presented
itself
,
there
was
suddenly
seen
to
emerge
from
all
*NL*
this
shadow
,
as
from
an
ambuscade
,
a
narrow
and
angular
forehead
,
a
*NL*
baleful
glance
,
a
threatening
chin
,
enormous
hands
,
and
a
monstrous
*NL*
cudgel
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
leisure
moments
,
which
were
far
from
frequent
,
he
read
,
although
*NL*
he
hated
books
;
this
caused
him
to
be
not
wholly
illiterate
.
This
could
*NL*
be
recognized
by
some
emphasis
in
his
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
,
he
had
no
vices
.
When
he
was
pleased
with
himself
,
*NL*
he
permitted
himself
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
Therein
lay
his
connection
with
*NL*
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
have
no
difficulty
in
understanding
that
Javert
was
the
*NL*
terror
of
that
whole
class
which
the
annual
statistics
of
the
Ministry
*NL*
of
Justice
designates
under
the
rubric
,
Vagrants
.
The
name
of
Javert
*NL*
routed
them
by
its
mere
utterance
;
the
face
of
Javert
petrified
them
at
*NL*
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
this
formidable
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
like
an
eye
constantly
fixed
on
M.
Madeleine
.
An
eye
full
of
*NL*
suspicion
and
conjecture
.
M.
Madeleine
had
finally
perceived
the
fact
;
*NL*
but
it
seemed
to
be
of
no
importance
to
him
.
He
did
not
even
put
a
*NL*
question
to
Javert
;
he
neither
sought
nor
avoided
him
;
he
bore
that
*NL*
embarrassing
and
almost
oppressive
gaze
without
appearing
to
notice
it
.
*NL*
He
treated
Javert
with
ease
and
courtesy
,
as
he
did
all
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
divined
,
from
some
words
which
escaped
Javert
,
that
he
had
*NL*
secretly
investigated
,
with
that
curiosity
which
belongs
to
the
race
,
*NL*
and
into
which
there
enters
as
much
instinct
as
will
,
all
the
anterior
*NL*
traces
which
Father
Madeleine
might
have
left
elsewhere
.
He
seemed
to
*NL*
know
,
and
he
sometimes
said
in
covert
words
,
that
some
one
had
gleaned
*NL*
certain
information
in
a
certain
district
about
a
family
which
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
Once
he
chanced
to
say
,
as
he
was
talking
to
himself
,
``
I
*NL*
think
I
have
him
!
''
Then
he
remained
pensive
for
three
days
,
and
uttered
*NL*
not
a
word
.
It
seemed
that
the
thread
which
he
thought
he
held
had
*NL*
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
and
this
furnishes
the
necessary
corrective
for
the
too
*NL*
absolute
sense
which
certain
words
might
present
,
there
can
be
nothing
*NL*
really
infallible
in
a
human
creature
,
and
the
peculiarity
of
instinct
*NL*
is
that
it
can
become
confused
,
thrown
off
the
track
,
and
defeated
.
*NL*
Otherwise
,
it
would
be
superior
to
intelligence
,
and
the
beast
would
be
*NL*
found
to
be
provided
with
a
better
light
than
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
evidently
somewhat
disconcerted
by
the
perfect
naturalness
*NL*
and
tranquillity
of
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
nevertheless
,
his
strange
manner
appeared
to
produce
an
*NL*
impression
on
M.
Madeleine
.
It
was
on
the
following
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
--
FATHER
FAUCHELEVENT
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
M.
Madeleine
was
passing
through
an
unpaved
alley
of
M.
sur
*NL*
M.
;
he
heard
a
noise
,
and
saw
a
group
some
distance
away
.
He
approached
.
*NL*
An
old
man
named
Father
Fauchelevent
had
just
fallen
beneath
his
cart
,
*NL*
his
horse
having
tumbled
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Fauchelevent
was
one
of
the
few
enemies
whom
M.
Madeleine
had
at
*NL*
that
time
.
When
Madeleine
arrived
in
the
neighborhood
,
Fauchelevent
,
an
*NL*
ex-notary
and
a
peasant
who
was
almost
educated
,
had
a
business
which
*NL*
was
beginning
to
be
in
a
bad
way
.
Fauchelevent
had
seen
this
simple
*NL*
workman
grow
rich
,
while
he
,
a
lawyer
,
was
being
ruined
.
This
had
filled
*NL*
him
with
jealousy
,
and
he
had
done
all
he
could
,
on
every
occasion
,
*NL*
to
injure
Madeleine
.
Then
bankruptcy
had
come
;
and
as
the
old
man
had
*NL*
nothing
left
but
a
cart
and
a
horse
,
and
neither
family
nor
children
,
he
*NL*
had
turned
carter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
had
two
broken
legs
and
could
not
rise
.
The
old
man
was
caught
*NL*
in
the
wheels
.
The
fall
had
been
so
unlucky
that
the
whole
weight
of
the
*NL*
vehicle
rested
on
his
breast
.
The
cart
was
quite
heavily
laden
.
Father
*NL*
Fauchelevent
was
rattling
in
the
throat
in
the
most
lamentable
manner
.
*NL*
They
had
tried
,
but
in
vain
,
to
drag
him
out
.
An
unmethodical
effort
,
*NL*
aid
awkwardly
given
,
a
wrong
shake
,
might
kill
him
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
disengage
him
otherwise
than
by
lifting
the
vehicle
off
of
him
.
*NL*
Javert
,
who
had
come
up
at
the
moment
of
the
accident
,
had
sent
for
a
*NL*
jack-screw
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
arrived
.
People
stood
aside
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
''
cried
old
Fauchelevent
.
``
Who
will
be
good
and
save
the
old
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
turned
towards
those
present
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
jack-screw
to
be
had
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
has
been
sent
for
,
''
answered
the
peasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
will
it
take
to
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
gone
for
the
nearest
,
to
Flachot
's
place
,
where
there
is
a
*NL*
farrier
;
but
it
makes
no
difference
;
it
will
take
a
good
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
quarter
of
an
hour
!
''
exclaimed
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
rained
on
the
preceding
night
;
the
soil
was
soaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cart
was
sinking
deeper
into
the
earth
every
moment
,
and
crushing
*NL*
the
old
carter
's
breast
more
and
more
.
It
was
evident
that
his
ribs
*NL*
would
be
broken
in
five
minutes
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
to
wait
another
quarter
of
an
hour
,
''
said
Madeleine
to
*NL*
the
peasants
,
who
were
staring
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
will
be
too
late
then
!
Do
n't
you
see
that
the
cart
is
sinking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
resumed
Madeleine
;
``
there
is
still
room
enough
under
the
cart
*NL*
to
allow
a
man
to
crawl
beneath
it
and
raise
it
with
his
back
.
Only
half
*NL*
a
minute
,
and
the
poor
man
can
be
taken
out
.
Is
there
any
one
here
who
*NL*
has
stout
loins
and
heart
?
There
are
five
louis
d'or
to
be
earned
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
man
in
the
group
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
louis
,
''
said
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
persons
present
dropped
their
eyes
.
One
of
them
muttered
:
``
A
man
*NL*
would
need
to
be
devilish
strong
.
And
then
he
runs
the
risk
of
getting
*NL*
crushed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
began
Madeleine
again
,
``
twenty
louis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
the
will
which
is
lacking
,
''
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
turned
round
,
and
recognized
Javert
.
He
had
not
noticed
him
*NL*
on
his
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
strength
.
One
would
have
to
be
a
terrible
man
to
do
such
a
thing
*NL*
as
lift
a
cart
like
that
on
his
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
gazing
fixedly
at
M.
Madeleine
,
he
went
on
,
emphasizing
every
word
*NL*
that
he
uttered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Madeleine
,
I
have
never
known
but
one
man
capable
of
doing
*NL*
what
you
ask
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madeleine
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
added
,
with
an
air
of
indifference
,
but
without
removing
his
eyes
*NL*
from
Madeleine
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
a
convict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
galleys
at
Toulon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madeleine
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
cart
continued
to
sink
slowly
.
Father
Fauchelevent
*NL*
rattled
in
the
throat
,
and
shrieked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
strangling
!
My
ribs
are
breaking
!
a
screw
!
something
!
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madeleine
glanced
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
,
then
,
no
one
who
wishes
to
earn
twenty
louis
and
save
the
*NL*
life
of
this
poor
old
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
stirred
.
Javert
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
known
but
one
man
who
could
take
the
place
of
a
screw
,
and
*NL*
he
was
that
convict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
It
is
crushing
me
!
''
cried
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madeleine
raised
his
head
,
met
Javert
's
falcon
eye
still
fixed
upon
*NL*
him
,
looked
at
the
motionless
peasants
,
and
smiled
sadly
.
Then
,
without
*NL*
saying
a
word
,
he
fell
on
his
knees
,
and
before
the
crowd
had
even
had
*NL*
time
to
utter
a
cry
,
he
was
underneath
the
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
moment
of
expectation
and
silence
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
beheld
Madeleine
,
almost
flat
on
his
stomach
beneath
that
terrible
*NL*
weight
,
make
two
vain
efforts
to
bring
his
knees
and
his
elbows
*NL*
together
.
They
shouted
to
him
,
``
Father
Madeleine
,
come
out
!
''
Old
*NL*
Fauchelevent
himself
said
to
him
,
``
Monsieur
Madeleine
,
go
away
!
You
see
*NL*
that
I
am
fated
to
die
!
Leave
me
!
You
will
get
yourself
crushed
also
!
''
*NL*
Madeleine
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
spectators
were
panting
.
The
wheels
had
continued
to
sink
,
and
*NL*
it
had
become
almost
impossible
for
Madeleine
to
make
his
way
from
under
*NL*
the
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
enormous
mass
was
seen
to
quiver
,
the
cart
rose
slowly
,
the
*NL*
wheels
half
emerged
from
the
ruts
.
They
heard
a
stifled
voice
crying
,
*NL*
``
Make
haste
!
Help
!
''
It
was
Madeleine
,
who
had
just
made
a
final
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
rushed
forwards
.
The
devotion
of
a
single
man
had
given
force
and
*NL*
courage
to
all
.
The
cart
was
raised
by
twenty
arms
.
Old
Fauchelevent
was
*NL*
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madeleine
rose
.
He
was
pale
,
though
dripping
with
perspiration
.
His
*NL*
clothes
were
torn
and
covered
with
mud
.
All
wept
.
The
old
man
kissed
*NL*
his
knees
and
called
him
the
good
God
.
As
for
him
,
he
bore
upon
*NL*
his
countenance
an
indescribable
expression
of
happy
and
celestial
*NL*
suffering
,
and
he
fixed
his
tranquil
eye
on
Javert
,
who
was
still
*NL*
staring
at
him
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
FAUCHELEVENT
BECOMES
A
GARDENER
IN
PARIS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
had
dislocated
his
kneepan
in
his
fall
.
Father
Madeleine
*NL*
had
him
conveyed
to
an
infirmary
which
he
had
established
for
his
*NL*
workmen
in
the
factory
building
itself
,
and
which
was
served
by
two
*NL*
sisters
of
charity
.
On
the
following
morning
the
old
man
found
a
*NL*
thousand-franc
bank-note
on
his
night-stand
,
with
these
words
in
Father
*NL*
Madeleine
's
writing
:
``
I
purchase
your
horse
and
cart
.
''
The
cart
was
*NL*
broken
,
and
the
horse
was
dead
.
Fauchelevent
recovered
,
but
his
knee
*NL*
remained
stiff
.
M.
Madeleine
,
on
the
recommendation
of
the
sisters
of
*NL*
charity
and
of
his
priest
,
got
the
good
man
a
place
as
gardener
in
a
*NL*
female
convent
in
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
afterwards
,
M.
Madeleine
was
appointed
mayor
.
The
first
time
*NL*
that
Javert
beheld
M.
Madeleine
clothed
in
the
scarf
which
gave
him
*NL*
authority
over
the
town
,
he
felt
the
sort
of
shudder
which
a
watch-dog
*NL*
might
experience
on
smelling
a
wolf
in
his
master
's
clothes
.
From
*NL*
that
time
forth
he
avoided
him
as
much
as
he
possibly
could
.
When
the
*NL*
requirements
of
the
service
imperatively
demanded
it
,
and
he
could
*NL*
not
do
otherwise
than
meet
the
mayor
,
he
addressed
him
with
profound
*NL*
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
prosperity
created
at
M.
sur
M.
by
Father
Madeleine
had
,
besides
*NL*
the
visible
signs
which
we
have
mentioned
,
another
symptom
which
was
*NL*
none
the
less
significant
for
not
being
visible
.
This
never
deceives
.
*NL*
When
the
population
suffers
,
when
work
is
lacking
,
when
there
is
no
*NL*
commerce
,
the
tax-payer
resists
imposts
through
penury
,
he
exhausts
and
*NL*
oversteps
his
respite
,
and
the
state
expends
a
great
deal
of
money
in
*NL*
the
charges
for
compelling
and
collection
.
When
work
is
abundant
,
when
*NL*
the
country
is
rich
and
happy
,
the
taxes
are
paid
easily
and
cost
the
*NL*
state
nothing
.
It
may
be
said
,
that
there
is
one
infallible
thermometer
*NL*
of
the
public
misery
and
riches
,
--
the
cost
of
collecting
the
taxes
.
*NL*
In
the
course
of
seven
years
the
expense
of
collecting
the
taxes
had
*NL*
diminished
three-fourths
in
the
arrondissement
of
M.
sur
M.
,
and
this
*NL*
led
to
this
arrondissement
being
frequently
cited
from
all
the
rest
by
*NL*
M.
de
Villele
,
then
Minister
of
Finance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
condition
of
the
country
when
Fantine
returned
thither
.
No
*NL*
one
remembered
her
.
Fortunately
,
the
door
of
M.
Madeleine
's
factory
was
*NL*
like
the
face
of
a
friend
.
She
presented
herself
there
,
and
was
admitted
*NL*
to
the
women
's
workroom
.
The
trade
was
entirely
new
to
Fantine
;
she
*NL*
could
not
be
very
skilful
at
it
,
and
she
therefore
earned
but
little
by
*NL*
her
day
's
work
;
but
it
was
sufficient
;
the
problem
was
solved
;
she
was
*NL*
earning
her
living
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
MADAME
VICTURNIEN
EXPENDS
THIRTY
FRANCS
ON
MORALITY
*NL*
*NL*
When
Fantine
saw
that
she
was
making
her
living
,
she
felt
joyful
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
To
live
honestly
by
her
own
labor
,
what
mercy
from
heaven
!
The
*NL*
taste
for
work
had
really
returned
to
her
.
She
bought
a
looking-glass
,
*NL*
took
pleasure
in
surveying
in
it
her
youth
,
her
beautiful
hair
,
her
fine
*NL*
teeth
;
she
forgot
many
things
;
she
thought
only
of
Cosette
and
of
the
*NL*
possible
future
,
and
was
almost
happy
.
She
hired
a
little
room
and
*NL*
furnished
on
credit
on
the
strength
of
her
future
work
--
a
lingering
*NL*
trace
of
her
improvident
ways
.
As
she
was
not
able
to
say
that
she
was
*NL*
married
she
took
good
care
,
as
we
have
seen
,
not
to
mention
her
little
*NL*
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
as
the
reader
has
seen
,
she
paid
the
Thenardiers
promptly
.
As
*NL*
she
only
knew
how
to
sign
her
name
,
she
was
obliged
to
write
through
a
*NL*
public
letter-writer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wrote
often
,
and
this
was
noticed
.
It
began
to
be
said
in
an
*NL*
undertone
,
in
the
women
's
workroom
,
that
Fantine
``
wrote
letters
''
and
*NL*
that
``
she
had
ways
about
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
one
for
spying
on
people
's
actions
like
those
who
are
*NL*
not
concerned
in
them
.
Why
does
that
gentleman
never
come
except
at
*NL*
nightfall
?
Why
does
Mr.
So-and-So
never
hang
his
key
on
its
nail
on
*NL*
Tuesday
?
Why
does
he
always
take
the
narrow
streets
?
Why
does
Madame
*NL*
always
descend
from
her
hackney-coach
before
reaching
her
house
?
Why
*NL*
does
she
send
out
to
purchase
six
sheets
of
note
paper
,
when
she
has
a
*NL*
``
whole
stationer
's
shop
full
of
it
?
''
etc.
.
There
exist
beings
who
,
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
obtaining
the
key
to
these
enigmas
,
which
are
,
moreover
,
of
*NL*
no
consequence
whatever
to
them
,
spend
more
money
,
waste
more
time
,
*NL*
take
more
trouble
,
than
would
be
required
for
ten
good
actions
,
and
*NL*
that
gratuitously
,
for
their
own
pleasure
,
without
receiving
any
other
*NL*
payment
for
their
curiosity
than
curiosity
.
They
will
follow
up
such
and
*NL*
such
a
man
or
woman
for
whole
days
;
they
will
do
sentry
duty
for
hours
*NL*
at
a
time
on
the
corners
of
the
streets
,
under
alley-way
doors
at
night
,
*NL*
in
cold
and
rain
;
they
will
bribe
errand-porters
,
they
will
make
the
*NL*
drivers
of
hackney-coaches
and
lackeys
tipsy
,
buy
a
waiting-maid
,
suborn
*NL*
a
porter
.
Why
?
For
no
reason
.
A
pure
passion
for
seeing
,
knowing
,
*NL*
and
penetrating
into
things
.
A
pure
itch
for
talking
.
And
often
*NL*
these
secrets
once
known
,
these
mysteries
made
public
,
these
enigmas
*NL*
illuminated
by
the
light
of
day
,
bring
on
catastrophies
,
duels
,
*NL*
failures
,
the
ruin
of
families
,
and
broken
lives
,
to
the
great
joy
*NL*
of
those
who
have
``
found
out
everything
,
''
without
any
interest
in
the
*NL*
matter
,
and
by
pure
instinct
.
A
sad
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
persons
are
malicious
solely
through
a
necessity
for
talking
.
*NL*
Their
conversation
,
the
chat
of
the
drawing-room
,
gossip
of
the
*NL*
anteroom
,
is
like
those
chimneys
which
consume
wood
rapidly
;
they
need
*NL*
a
great
amount
of
combustibles
;
and
their
combustibles
are
furnished
by
*NL*
their
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Fantine
was
watched
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
,
many
a
one
was
jealous
of
her
golden
hair
and
of
her
white
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
remarked
that
in
the
workroom
she
often
turned
aside
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
rest
,
to
wipe
away
a
tear
.
These
were
the
moments
when
she
*NL*
was
thinking
of
her
child
;
perhaps
,
also
,
of
the
man
whom
she
had
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Breaking
the
gloomy
bonds
of
the
past
is
a
mournful
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
observed
that
she
wrote
twice
a
month
at
least
,
and
that
she
*NL*
paid
the
carriage
on
the
letter
.
They
managed
to
obtain
the
address
:
*NL*
Monsieur
,
Monsieur
Thenardier
,
inn-keeper
at
Montfermeil
.
The
public
*NL*
writer
,
a
good
old
man
who
could
not
fill
his
stomach
with
red
wine
*NL*
without
emptying
his
pocket
of
secrets
,
was
made
to
talk
in
the
*NL*
wine-shop
.
In
short
,
it
was
discovered
that
Fantine
had
a
child
.
``
She
*NL*
must
be
a
pretty
sort
of
a
woman
.
''
An
old
gossip
was
found
,
who
made
the
*NL*
trip
to
Montfermeil
,
talked
to
the
Thenardiers
,
and
said
on
her
return
:
*NL*
``
For
my
five
and
thirty
francs
I
have
freed
my
mind
.
I
have
seen
the
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gossip
who
did
this
thing
was
a
gorgon
named
Madame
Victurnien
,
the
*NL*
guardian
and
door-keeper
of
every
one
's
virtue
.
Madame
Victurnien
was
*NL*
fifty-six
,
and
re-enforced
the
mask
of
ugliness
with
the
mask
of
age
.
*NL*
A
quavering
voice
,
a
whimsical
mind
.
This
old
dame
had
once
been
*NL*
young
--
astonishing
fact
!
In
her
youth
,
in
'
93
,
she
had
married
a
*NL*
monk
who
had
fled
from
his
cloister
in
a
red
cap
,
and
passed
from
*NL*
the
Bernardines
to
the
Jacobins
.
She
was
dry
,
rough
,
peevish
,
sharp
,
*NL*
captious
,
almost
venomous
;
all
this
in
memory
of
her
monk
,
whose
widow
*NL*
she
was
,
and
who
had
ruled
over
her
masterfully
and
bent
her
to
his
*NL*
will
.
She
was
a
nettle
in
which
the
rustle
of
the
cassock
was
visible
.
*NL*
At
the
Restoration
she
had
turned
bigot
,
and
that
with
so
much
energy
*NL*
that
the
priests
had
forgiven
her
her
monk
.
She
had
a
small
property
,
*NL*
which
she
bequeathed
with
much
ostentation
to
a
religious
community
.
*NL*
She
was
in
high
favor
at
the
episcopal
palace
of
Arras
.
So
this
Madame
*NL*
Victurnien
went
to
Montfermeil
,
and
returned
with
the
remark
,
``
I
have
*NL*
seen
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
took
time
.
Fantine
had
been
at
the
factory
for
more
than
a
*NL*
year
,
when
,
one
morning
,
the
superintendent
of
the
workroom
handed
her
*NL*
fifty
francs
from
the
mayor
,
told
her
that
she
was
no
longer
employed
*NL*
in
the
shop
,
and
requested
her
,
in
the
mayor
's
name
,
to
leave
the
*NL*
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
very
month
when
the
Thenardiers
,
after
having
demanded
*NL*
twelve
francs
instead
of
six
,
had
just
exacted
fifteen
francs
instead
of
*NL*
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
was
overwhelmed
.
She
could
not
leave
the
neighborhood
;
she
was
*NL*
in
debt
for
her
rent
and
furniture
.
Fifty
francs
was
not
sufficient
*NL*
to
cancel
this
debt
.
She
stammered
a
few
supplicating
words
.
The
*NL*
superintendent
ordered
her
to
leave
the
shop
on
the
instant
.
Besides
,
*NL*
Fantine
was
only
a
moderately
good
workwoman
.
Overcome
with
shame
,
even
*NL*
more
than
with
despair
,
she
quitted
the
shop
,
and
returned
to
her
room
.
*NL*
So
her
fault
was
now
known
to
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
felt
strong
enough
to
say
a
word
.
She
was
advised
to
*NL*
see
the
mayor
;
she
did
not
dare
.
The
mayor
had
given
her
fifty
francs
*NL*
because
he
was
good
,
and
had
dismissed
her
because
he
was
just
.
She
*NL*
bowed
before
the
decision
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
MADAME
VICTURNIEN
'S
SUCCESS
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
monk
's
widow
was
good
for
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
M.
Madeleine
had
heard
nothing
of
all
this
.
Life
is
full
of
just
*NL*
such
combinations
of
events
.
M.
Madeleine
was
in
the
habit
of
almost
*NL*
never
entering
the
women
's
workroom
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
head
of
this
room
he
had
placed
an
elderly
spinster
,
whom
*NL*
the
priest
had
provided
for
him
,
and
he
had
full
confidence
in
this
*NL*
superintendent
,
--
a
truly
respectable
person
,
firm
,
equitable
,
upright
,
*NL*
full
of
the
charity
which
consists
in
giving
,
but
not
having
in
the
same
*NL*
degree
that
charity
which
consists
in
understanding
and
in
forgiving
.
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
relied
wholly
on
her
.
The
best
men
are
often
obliged
*NL*
to
delegate
their
authority
.
It
was
with
this
full
power
,
and
the
*NL*
conviction
that
she
was
doing
right
,
that
the
superintendent
had
*NL*
instituted
the
suit
,
judged
,
condemned
,
and
executed
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
regards
the
fifty
francs
,
she
had
given
them
from
a
fund
which
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
had
intrusted
to
her
for
charitable
purposes
,
and
for
giving
*NL*
assistance
to
the
workwomen
,
and
of
which
she
rendered
no
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
tried
to
obtain
a
situation
as
a
servant
in
the
neighborhood
;
*NL*
she
went
from
house
to
house
.
No
one
would
have
her
.
She
could
not
*NL*
leave
town
.
The
second-hand
dealer
,
to
whom
she
was
in
debt
for
her
*NL*
furniture
--
and
what
furniture
!
--
said
to
her
,
``
If
you
leave
,
I
will
have
*NL*
you
arrested
as
a
thief
.
''
The
householder
,
whom
she
owed
for
her
rent
,
*NL*
said
to
her
,
``
You
are
young
and
pretty
;
you
can
pay
.
''
She
divided
the
*NL*
fifty
francs
between
the
landlord
and
the
furniture-dealer
,
returned
to
*NL*
the
latter
three-quarters
of
his
goods
,
kept
only
necessaries
,
and
found
*NL*
herself
without
work
,
without
a
trade
,
with
nothing
but
her
bed
,
and
*NL*
still
about
fifty
francs
in
debt
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
make
coarse
shirts
for
soldiers
of
the
garrison
,
and
earned
*NL*
twelve
sous
a
day
.
Her
daughter
cost
her
ten
.
It
was
at
this
point
that
*NL*
she
began
to
pay
the
Thenardiers
irregularly
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
old
woman
who
lighted
her
candle
for
her
when
she
returned
*NL*
at
night
,
taught
her
the
art
of
living
in
misery
.
Back
of
living
on
*NL*
little
,
there
is
the
living
on
nothing
.
These
are
the
two
chambers
;
the
*NL*
first
is
dark
,
the
second
is
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
learned
how
to
live
without
fire
entirely
in
the
winter
;
how
to
*NL*
give
up
a
bird
which
eats
a
half
a
farthing
's
worth
of
millet
every
*NL*
two
days
;
how
to
make
a
coverlet
of
one
's
petticoat
,
and
a
petticoat
of
*NL*
one
's
coverlet
;
how
to
save
one
's
candle
,
by
taking
one
's
meals
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
opposite
window
.
No
one
knows
all
that
certain
feeble
*NL*
creatures
,
who
have
grown
old
in
privation
and
honesty
,
can
get
out
of
*NL*
a
sou
.
It
ends
by
being
a
talent
.
Fantine
acquired
this
sublime
talent
,
*NL*
and
regained
a
little
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
epoch
she
said
to
a
neighbor
,
``
Bah
!
I
say
to
myself
,
by
only
*NL*
sleeping
five
hours
,
and
working
all
the
rest
of
the
time
at
my
sewing
,
*NL*
I
shall
always
manage
to
nearly
earn
my
bread
.
And
,
then
,
when
one
is
*NL*
sad
,
one
eats
less
.
Well
,
sufferings
,
uneasiness
,
a
little
bread
on
one
*NL*
hand
,
trouble
on
the
other
,
--
all
this
will
support
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
have
been
a
great
happiness
to
have
her
little
girl
with
her
in
*NL*
this
distress
.
She
thought
of
having
her
come
.
But
what
then
!
Make
her
*NL*
share
her
own
destitution
!
And
then
,
she
was
in
debt
to
the
Thenardiers
!
*NL*
How
could
she
pay
them
?
And
the
journey
!
How
pay
for
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
who
had
given
her
lessons
in
what
may
be
called
the
life
*NL*
of
indigence
,
was
a
sainted
spinster
named
Marguerite
,
who
was
pious
*NL*
with
a
true
piety
,
poor
and
charitable
towards
the
poor
,
and
even
*NL*
towards
the
rich
,
knowing
how
to
write
just
sufficiently
to
sign
herself
*NL*
Marguerite
,
and
believing
in
God
,
which
is
science
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
such
virtuous
people
in
this
lower
world
;
some
day
they
*NL*
will
be
in
the
world
above
.
This
life
has
a
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
Fantine
had
been
so
ashamed
that
she
had
not
dared
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
was
in
the
street
,
she
divined
that
people
turned
round
behind
*NL*
her
,
and
pointed
at
her
;
every
one
stared
at
her
and
no
one
greeted
her
;
*NL*
the
cold
and
bitter
scorn
of
the
passers-by
penetrated
her
very
flesh
*NL*
and
soul
like
a
north
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
as
though
an
unfortunate
woman
were
utterly
bare
beneath
the
*NL*
sarcasm
and
the
curiosity
of
all
in
small
towns
.
In
Paris
,
at
least
,
no
*NL*
one
knows
you
,
and
this
obscurity
is
a
garment
.
Oh
!
how
she
would
have
*NL*
liked
to
betake
herself
to
Paris
!
Impossible
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
obliged
to
accustom
herself
to
disrepute
,
as
she
had
accustomed
*NL*
herself
to
indigence
.
Gradually
she
decided
on
her
course
.
At
the
*NL*
expiration
of
two
or
three
months
she
shook
off
her
shame
,
and
began
to
*NL*
go
about
as
though
there
were
nothing
the
matter
.
``
It
is
all
the
same
to
*NL*
me
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
and
came
,
bearing
her
head
well
up
,
with
a
bitter
smile
,
and
*NL*
was
conscious
that
she
was
becoming
brazen-faced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Victurnien
sometimes
saw
her
passing
,
from
her
window
,
noticed
*NL*
the
distress
of
``
that
creature
''
who
,
``
thanks
to
her
,
''
had
been
``
put
back
*NL*
in
her
proper
place
,
''
and
congratulated
herself
.
The
happiness
of
the
*NL*
evil-minded
is
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excess
of
toil
wore
out
Fantine
,
and
the
little
dry
cough
which
troubled
*NL*
her
increased
.
She
sometimes
said
to
her
neighbor
,
Marguerite
,
``
Just
*NL*
feel
how
hot
my
hands
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
when
she
combed
her
beautiful
hair
in
the
morning
with
*NL*
an
old
broken
comb
,
and
it
flowed
about
her
like
floss
silk
,
she
*NL*
experienced
a
moment
of
happy
coquetry
.

CHAPTER
X
--
RESULT
OF
THE
SUCCESS
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
dismissed
towards
the
end
of
the
winter
;
the
summer
passed
,
*NL*
but
winter
came
again
.
Short
days
,
less
work
.
Winter
:
no
warmth
,
*NL*
no
light
,
no
noonday
,
the
evening
joining
on
to
the
morning
,
fogs
,
*NL*
twilight
;
the
window
is
gray
;
it
is
impossible
to
see
clearly
at
it
.
The
*NL*
sky
is
but
a
vent-hole
.
The
whole
day
is
a
cavern
.
The
sun
has
the
air
*NL*
of
a
beggar
.
A
frightful
season
!
Winter
changes
the
water
of
heaven
and
*NL*
the
heart
of
man
into
a
stone
.
Her
creditors
harrassed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
earned
too
little
.
Her
debts
had
increased
.
The
Thenardiers
,
who
*NL*
were
not
promptly
paid
,
wrote
to
her
constantly
letters
whose
contents
*NL*
drove
her
to
despair
,
and
whose
carriage
ruined
her
.
One
day
they
wrote
*NL*
to
her
that
her
little
Cosette
was
entirely
naked
in
that
cold
weather
,
*NL*
that
she
needed
a
woollen
skirt
,
and
that
her
mother
must
send
at
least
*NL*
ten
francs
for
this
.
She
received
the
letter
,
and
crushed
it
in
her
*NL*
hands
all
day
long
.
That
evening
she
went
into
a
barber
's
shop
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
street
,
and
pulled
out
her
comb
.
Her
admirable
golden
hair
*NL*
fell
to
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
splendid
hair
!
''
exclaimed
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
will
you
give
me
for
it
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
it
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
purchased
a
knitted
petticoat
and
sent
it
to
the
Thenardiers
.
This
*NL*
petticoat
made
the
Thenardiers
furious
.
It
was
the
money
that
they
*NL*
wanted
.
They
gave
the
petticoat
to
Eponine
.
The
poor
Lark
continued
to
*NL*
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
thought
:
``
My
child
is
no
longer
cold
.
I
have
clothed
her
with
my
*NL*
hair
.
''
She
put
on
little
round
caps
which
concealed
her
shorn
head
,
and
*NL*
in
which
she
was
still
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dark
thoughts
held
possession
of
Fantine
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
saw
that
she
could
no
longer
dress
her
hair
,
she
began
to
hate
*NL*
every
one
about
her
.
She
had
long
shared
the
universal
veneration
for
*NL*
Father
Madeleine
;
yet
,
by
dint
of
repeating
to
herself
that
it
was
he
*NL*
who
had
discharged
her
,
that
he
was
the
cause
of
her
unhappiness
,
she
*NL*
came
to
hate
him
also
,
and
most
of
all
.
When
she
passed
the
factory
in
*NL*
working
hours
,
when
the
workpeople
were
at
the
door
,
she
affected
to
*NL*
laugh
and
sing
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
workwoman
who
once
saw
her
laughing
and
singing
in
this
fashion
*NL*
said
,
``
There
's
a
girl
who
will
come
to
a
bad
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
a
lover
,
the
first
who
offered
,
a
man
whom
she
did
not
love
,
*NL*
out
of
bravado
and
with
rage
in
her
heart
.
He
was
a
miserable
scamp
,
*NL*
a
sort
of
mendicant
musician
,
a
lazy
beggar
,
who
beat
her
,
and
who
*NL*
abandoned
her
as
she
had
taken
him
,
in
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
adored
her
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lower
she
descended
,
the
darker
everything
grew
about
her
,
the
more
*NL*
radiant
shone
that
little
angel
at
the
bottom
of
her
heart
.
She
said
,
*NL*
``
When
I
get
rich
,
I
will
have
my
Cosette
with
me
;
''
and
she
laughed
.
Her
*NL*
cough
did
not
leave
her
,
and
she
had
sweats
on
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
received
from
the
Thenardiers
a
letter
couched
in
the
*NL*
following
terms
:
``
Cosette
is
ill
with
a
malady
which
is
going
the
rounds
*NL*
of
the
neighborhood
.
A
miliary
fever
,
they
call
it
.
Expensive
drugs
are
*NL*
required
.
This
is
ruining
us
,
and
we
can
no
longer
pay
for
them
.
If
you
*NL*
do
not
send
us
forty
francs
before
the
week
is
out
,
the
little
one
will
*NL*
be
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
burst
out
laughing
,
and
said
to
her
old
neighbor
:
``
Ah
!
they
are
*NL*
good
!
Forty
francs
!
the
idea
!
That
makes
two
napoleons
!
Where
do
they
*NL*
think
I
am
to
get
them
?
These
peasants
are
stupid
,
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
she
went
to
a
dormer
window
in
the
staircase
and
read
the
*NL*
letter
once
more
.
Then
she
descended
the
stairs
and
emerged
,
running
and
*NL*
leaping
and
still
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
met
her
and
said
to
her
,
``
What
makes
you
so
gay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
:
``
A
fine
piece
of
stupidity
that
some
country
people
have
*NL*
written
to
me
.
They
demand
forty
francs
of
me
.
So
much
for
you
,
you
*NL*
peasants
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
crossed
the
square
,
she
saw
a
great
many
people
collected
around
*NL*
a
carriage
of
eccentric
shape
,
upon
the
top
of
which
stood
a
man
dressed
*NL*
in
red
,
who
was
holding
forth
.
He
was
a
quack
dentist
on
his
rounds
,
*NL*
who
was
offering
to
the
public
full
sets
of
teeth
,
opiates
,
powders
and
*NL*
elixirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
mingled
in
the
group
,
and
began
to
laugh
with
the
rest
at
*NL*
the
harangue
,
which
contained
slang
for
the
populace
and
jargon
for
*NL*
respectable
people
.
The
tooth-puller
espied
the
lovely
,
laughing
girl
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
exclaimed
:
``
You
have
beautiful
teeth
,
you
girl
there
,
who
*NL*
are
laughing
;
if
you
want
to
sell
me
your
palettes
,
I
will
give
you
a
*NL*
gold
napoleon
apiece
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
my
palettes
?
''
asked
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
palettes
,
''
replied
the
dental
professor
,
``
are
the
front
teeth
,
the
*NL*
two
upper
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
horrible
!
''
exclaimed
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
napoleons
!
''
grumbled
a
toothless
old
woman
who
was
present
.
``
Here
's
*NL*
a
lucky
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
fled
and
stopped
her
ears
that
she
might
not
hear
the
hoarse
*NL*
voice
of
the
man
shouting
to
her
:
``
Reflect
,
my
beauty
!
two
napoleons
;
*NL*
they
may
prove
of
service
.
If
your
heart
bids
you
,
come
this
evening
to
*NL*
the
inn
of
the
Tillac
d'Argent
;
you
will
find
me
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
returned
home
.
She
was
furious
,
and
related
the
occurrence
to
*NL*
her
good
neighbor
Marguerite
:
``
Can
you
understand
such
a
thing
?
Is
he
*NL*
not
an
abominable
man
?
How
can
they
allow
such
people
to
go
about
the
*NL*
country
!
Pull
out
my
two
front
teeth
!
Why
,
I
should
be
horrible
!
My
hair
*NL*
will
grow
again
,
but
my
teeth
!
Ah
!
what
a
monster
of
a
man
!
I
should
*NL*
prefer
to
throw
myself
head
first
on
the
pavement
from
the
fifth
story
!
*NL*
He
told
me
that
he
should
be
at
the
Tillac
d'Argent
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
did
he
offer
?
''
asked
Marguerite
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
napoleons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
forty
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Fantine
;
``
that
makes
forty
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
thoughtful
,
and
began
her
work
.
At
the
expiration
of
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
she
left
her
sewing
and
went
to
read
the
Thenardiers
'
*NL*
letter
once
more
on
the
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
return
,
she
said
to
Marguerite
,
who
was
at
work
beside
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
a
miliary
fever
?
Do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
answered
the
old
spinster
;
``
it
is
a
disease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
require
many
drugs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
terrible
drugs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
one
get
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
malady
that
one
gets
without
knowing
how
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
attacks
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Children
in
particular
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
people
die
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
may
,
''
said
Marguerite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
left
the
room
and
went
to
read
her
letter
once
more
on
the
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
she
went
out
,
and
was
seen
to
turn
her
steps
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
Rue
de
Paris
,
where
the
inns
are
situated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
,
when
Marguerite
entered
Fantine
's
room
before
*NL*
daylight
,
--
for
they
always
worked
together
,
and
in
this
manner
used
only
*NL*
one
candle
for
the
two
,
--
she
found
Fantine
seated
on
her
bed
,
pale
and
*NL*
frozen
.
She
had
not
lain
down
.
Her
cap
had
fallen
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
Her
candle
had
burned
all
night
,
and
was
almost
entirely
consumed
.
*NL*
Marguerite
halted
on
the
threshold
,
petrified
at
this
tremendous
*NL*
wastefulness
,
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
!
the
candle
is
all
burned
out
!
Something
has
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
looked
at
Fantine
,
who
turned
toward
her
her
head
bereft
of
its
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
had
grown
ten
years
older
since
the
preceding
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jesus
!
''
said
Marguerite
,
``
what
is
the
matter
with
you
,
Fantine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
replied
Fantine
.
``
Quite
the
contrary
.
My
child
will
not
die
*NL*
of
that
frightful
malady
,
for
lack
of
succor
.
I
am
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
pointed
out
to
the
spinster
two
napoleons
which
were
*NL*
glittering
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Jesus
God
!
''
cried
Marguerite
.
``
Why
,
it
is
a
fortune
!
Where
did
you
*NL*
get
those
louis
d'or
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
got
them
,
''
replied
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
she
smiled
.
The
candle
illuminated
her
countenance
.
It
*NL*
was
a
bloody
smile
.
A
reddish
saliva
soiled
the
corners
of
her
lips
,
and
*NL*
she
had
a
black
hole
in
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
teeth
had
been
extracted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sent
the
forty
francs
to
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
it
was
a
ruse
of
the
Thenardiers
to
obtain
money
.
Cosette
was
*NL*
not
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
threw
her
mirror
out
of
the
window
.
She
had
long
since
quitted
*NL*
her
cell
on
the
second
floor
for
an
attic
with
only
a
latch
to
fasten
*NL*
it
,
next
the
roof
;
one
of
those
attics
whose
extremity
forms
an
angle
*NL*
with
the
floor
,
and
knocks
you
on
the
head
every
instant
.
The
poor
*NL*
occupant
can
reach
the
end
of
his
chamber
as
he
can
the
end
of
his
*NL*
destiny
,
only
by
bending
over
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
no
longer
a
bed
;
a
rag
which
she
called
her
coverlet
,
a
mattress
*NL*
on
the
floor
,
and
a
seatless
chair
still
remained
.
A
little
rosebush
*NL*
which
she
had
,
had
dried
up
,
forgotten
,
in
one
corner
.
In
the
other
*NL*
corner
was
a
butter-pot
to
hold
water
,
which
froze
in
winter
,
and
in
*NL*
which
the
various
levels
of
the
water
remained
long
marked
by
these
*NL*
circles
of
ice
.
She
had
lost
her
shame
;
she
lost
her
coquetry
.
A
final
*NL*
sign
.
She
went
out
,
with
dirty
caps
.
Whether
from
lack
of
time
or
from
*NL*
indifference
,
she
no
longer
mended
her
linen
.
As
the
heels
wore
out
,
*NL*
she
dragged
her
stockings
down
into
her
shoes
.
This
was
evident
from
the
*NL*
perpendicular
wrinkles
.
She
patched
her
bodice
,
which
was
old
and
worn
*NL*
out
,
with
scraps
of
calico
which
tore
at
the
slightest
movement
.
The
*NL*
people
to
whom
she
was
indebted
made
``
scenes
''
and
gave
her
no
peace
.
*NL*
She
found
them
in
the
street
,
she
found
them
again
on
her
staircase
.
She
*NL*
passed
many
a
night
weeping
and
thinking
.
Her
eyes
were
very
bright
,
*NL*
and
she
felt
a
steady
pain
in
her
shoulder
towards
the
top
of
the
*NL*
left
shoulder-blade
.
She
coughed
a
great
deal
.
She
deeply
hated
Father
*NL*
Madeleine
,
but
made
no
complaint
.
She
sewed
seventeen
hours
a
day
;
but
*NL*
a
contractor
for
the
work
of
prisons
,
who
made
the
prisoners
work
at
a
*NL*
discount
,
suddenly
made
prices
fall
,
which
reduced
the
daily
earnings
*NL*
of
working-women
to
nine
sous
.
Seventeen
hours
of
toil
,
and
nine
sous
a
*NL*
day
!
Her
creditors
were
more
pitiless
than
ever
.
The
second-hand
dealer
,
*NL*
who
had
taken
back
nearly
all
his
furniture
,
said
to
her
incessantly
,
*NL*
``
When
will
you
pay
me
,
you
hussy
?
''
What
did
they
want
of
her
,
good
God
!
*NL*
She
felt
that
she
was
being
hunted
,
and
something
of
the
wild
beast
*NL*
developed
in
her
.
About
the
same
time
,
Thenardier
wrote
to
her
that
he
*NL*
had
waited
with
decidedly
too
much
amiability
and
that
he
must
have
a
*NL*
hundred
francs
at
once
;
otherwise
he
would
turn
little
Cosette
out
of
*NL*
doors
,
convalescent
as
she
was
from
her
heavy
illness
,
into
the
cold
and
*NL*
the
streets
,
and
that
she
might
do
what
she
liked
with
herself
,
and
die
*NL*
if
she
chose
.
``
A
hundred
francs
,
''
thought
Fantine
.
``
But
in
what
trade
*NL*
can
one
earn
a
hundred
sous
a
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
she
,
``
let
us
sell
what
is
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfortunate
girl
became
a
woman
of
the
town
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
CHRISTUS
NOS
LIBERAVIT
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
this
history
of
Fantine
?
It
is
society
purchasing
a
slave
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
whom
?
From
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
hunger
,
cold
,
isolation
,
destitution
.
A
dolorous
bargain
.
A
soul
*NL*
for
a
morsel
of
bread
.
Misery
offers
;
society
accepts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sacred
law
of
Jesus
Christ
governs
our
civilization
,
but
it
does
*NL*
not
,
as
yet
,
permeate
it
;
it
is
said
that
slavery
has
disappeared
from
*NL*
European
civilization
.
This
is
a
mistake
.
It
still
exists
;
but
it
weighs
*NL*
only
upon
the
woman
,
and
it
is
called
prostitution
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
weighs
upon
the
woman
,
that
is
to
say
,
upon
grace
,
weakness
,
beauty
,
*NL*
maternity
.
This
is
not
one
of
the
least
of
man
's
disgraces
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
point
in
this
melancholy
drama
which
we
have
now
reached
,
nothing
*NL*
is
left
to
Fantine
of
that
which
she
had
formerly
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
has
become
marble
in
becoming
mire
.
Whoever
touches
her
feels
cold
.
*NL*
She
passes
;
she
endures
you
;
she
ignores
you
;
she
is
the
severe
and
*NL*
dishonored
figure
.
Life
and
the
social
order
have
said
their
last
word
*NL*
for
her
.
All
has
happened
to
her
that
will
happen
to
her
.
She
has
*NL*
felt
everything
,
borne
everything
,
experienced
everything
,
suffered
*NL*
everything
,
lost
everything
,
mourned
everything
.
She
is
resigned
,
with
*NL*
that
resignation
which
resembles
indifference
,
as
death
resembles
sleep
.
*NL*
She
no
longer
avoids
anything
.
Let
all
the
clouds
fall
upon
her
,
and
all
*NL*
the
ocean
sweep
over
her
!
What
matters
it
to
her
?
She
is
a
sponge
that
*NL*
is
soaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
least
,
she
believes
it
to
be
so
;
but
it
is
an
error
to
imagine
that
*NL*
fate
can
be
exhausted
,
and
that
one
has
reached
the
bottom
of
anything
*NL*
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
What
are
all
these
fates
,
driven
on
pell-mell
?
Whither
are
they
*NL*
going
?
Why
are
they
thus
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
knows
that
sees
the
whole
of
the
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
alone
.
His
name
is
God

CHAPTER
XII
--
M.
BAMATABOIS
'S
INACTIVITY
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
in
all
small
towns
,
and
there
was
at
M.
sur
M.
in
particular
,
*NL*
a
class
of
young
men
who
nibble
away
an
income
of
fifteen
hundred
*NL*
francs
with
the
same
air
with
which
their
prototypes
devour
two
hundred
*NL*
thousand
francs
a
year
in
Paris
.
These
are
beings
of
the
great
neuter
*NL*
species
:
impotent
men
,
parasites
,
cyphers
,
who
have
a
little
land
,
a
*NL*
little
folly
,
a
little
wit
;
who
would
be
rustics
in
a
drawing-room
,
and
*NL*
who
think
themselves
gentlemen
in
the
dram-shop
;
who
say
,
``
My
fields
,
*NL*
my
peasants
,
my
woods
''
;
who
hiss
actresses
at
the
theatre
to
prove
that
*NL*
they
are
persons
of
taste
;
quarrel
with
the
officers
of
the
garrison
*NL*
to
prove
that
they
are
men
of
war
;
hunt
,
smoke
,
yawn
,
drink
,
smell
of
*NL*
tobacco
,
play
billiards
,
stare
at
travellers
as
they
descend
from
the
*NL*
diligence
,
live
at
the
cafe
,
dine
at
the
inn
,
have
a
dog
which
eats
the
*NL*
bones
under
the
table
,
and
a
mistress
who
eats
the
dishes
on
the
table
;
*NL*
who
stick
at
a
sou
,
exaggerate
the
fashions
,
admire
tragedy
,
despise
*NL*
women
,
wear
out
their
old
boots
,
copy
London
through
Paris
,
and
Paris
*NL*
through
the
medium
of
Pont-A-Mousson
,
grow
old
as
dullards
,
never
work
,
*NL*
serve
no
use
,
and
do
no
great
harm
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Felix
Tholomyes
,
had
he
remained
in
his
own
province
and
never
beheld
*NL*
Paris
,
would
have
been
one
of
these
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
they
were
richer
,
one
would
say
,
``
They
are
dandies
;
''
if
they
were
*NL*
poorer
,
one
would
say
,
``
They
are
idlers
.
''
They
are
simply
men
without
*NL*
employment
.
Among
these
unemployed
there
are
bores
,
the
bored
,
dreamers
,
*NL*
and
some
knaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
period
a
dandy
was
composed
of
a
tall
collar
,
a
big
cravat
,
a
*NL*
watch
with
trinkets
,
three
vests
of
different
colors
,
worn
one
on
top
of
*NL*
the
other
--
the
red
and
blue
inside
;
of
a
short-waisted
olive
coat
,
with
*NL*
a
codfish
tail
,
a
double
row
of
silver
buttons
set
close
to
each
other
*NL*
and
running
up
to
the
shoulder
;
and
a
pair
of
trousers
of
a
lighter
*NL*
shade
of
olive
,
ornamented
on
the
two
seams
with
an
indefinite
,
but
*NL*
always
uneven
,
number
of
lines
,
varying
from
one
to
eleven
--
a
limit
*NL*
which
was
never
exceeded
.
Add
to
this
,
high
shoes
with
little
irons
*NL*
on
the
heels
,
a
tall
hat
with
a
narrow
brim
,
hair
worn
in
a
tuft
,
an
*NL*
enormous
cane
,
and
conversation
set
off
by
puns
of
Potier
.
Over
all
,
*NL*
spurs
and
a
mustache
.
At
that
epoch
mustaches
indicated
the
bourgeois
,
*NL*
and
spurs
the
pedestrian
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
provincial
dandy
wore
the
longest
of
spurs
and
the
fiercest
of
*NL*
mustaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
period
of
the
conflict
of
the
republics
of
South
America
with
*NL*
the
King
of
Spain
,
of
Bolivar
against
Morillo
.
Narrow-brimmed
hats
were
*NL*
royalist
,
and
were
called
morillos
;
liberals
wore
hats
with
wide
brims
,
*NL*
which
were
called
bolivars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
or
ten
months
,
then
,
after
that
which
is
related
in
the
preceding
*NL*
pages
,
towards
the
first
of
January
,
1823
,
on
a
snowy
evening
,
one
of
*NL*
these
dandies
,
one
of
these
unemployed
,
a
``
right
thinker
,
''
for
he
wore
*NL*
a
morillo
,
and
was
,
moreover
,
warmly
enveloped
in
one
of
those
large
*NL*
cloaks
which
completed
the
fashionable
costume
in
cold
weather
,
was
*NL*
amusing
himself
by
tormenting
a
creature
who
was
prowling
about
in
a
*NL*
ball-dress
,
with
neck
uncovered
and
flowers
in
her
hair
,
in
front
of
*NL*
the
officers
'
cafe
.
This
dandy
was
smoking
,
for
he
was
decidedly
*NL*
fashionable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
time
that
the
woman
passed
in
front
of
him
,
he
bestowed
on
her
,
*NL*
together
with
a
puff
from
his
cigar
,
some
apostrophe
which
he
considered
*NL*
witty
and
mirthful
,
such
as
,
``
How
ugly
you
are
!
--
Will
you
get
out
of
my
*NL*
sight
?
--
You
have
no
teeth
!
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
This
gentleman
was
known
as
M.
*NL*
Bamatabois
.
The
woman
,
a
melancholy
,
decorated
spectre
which
went
and
*NL*
came
through
the
snow
,
made
him
no
reply
,
did
not
even
glance
at
him
,
*NL*
and
nevertheless
continued
her
promenade
in
silence
,
and
with
a
sombre
*NL*
regularity
,
which
brought
her
every
five
minutes
within
reach
of
this
*NL*
sarcasm
,
like
the
condemned
soldier
who
returns
under
the
rods
.
The
*NL*
small
effect
which
he
produced
no
doubt
piqued
the
lounger
;
and
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
a
moment
when
her
back
was
turned
,
he
crept
up
behind
her
*NL*
with
the
gait
of
a
wolf
,
and
stifling
his
laugh
,
bent
down
,
picked
up
a
*NL*
handful
of
snow
from
the
pavement
,
and
thrust
it
abruptly
into
her
back
,
*NL*
between
her
bare
shoulders
.
The
woman
uttered
a
roar
,
whirled
round
,
*NL*
gave
a
leap
like
a
panther
,
and
hurled
herself
upon
the
man
,
burying
her
*NL*
nails
in
his
face
,
with
the
most
frightful
words
which
could
fall
from
*NL*
the
guard-room
into
the
gutter
.
These
insults
,
poured
forth
in
a
voice
*NL*
roughened
by
brandy
,
did
,
indeed
,
proceed
in
hideous
wise
from
a
mouth
*NL*
which
lacked
its
two
front
teeth
.
It
was
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
noise
thus
produced
,
the
officers
ran
out
in
throngs
from
the
*NL*
cafe
,
passers-by
collected
,
and
a
large
and
merry
circle
,
hooting
and
*NL*
applauding
,
was
formed
around
this
whirlwind
composed
of
two
beings
,
*NL*
whom
there
was
some
difficulty
in
recognizing
as
a
man
and
a
woman
:
the
*NL*
man
struggling
,
his
hat
on
the
ground
;
the
woman
striking
out
with
feet
*NL*
and
fists
,
bareheaded
,
howling
,
minus
hair
and
teeth
,
livid
with
wrath
,
*NL*
horrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
a
man
of
lofty
stature
emerged
vivaciously
from
the
crowd
,
*NL*
seized
the
woman
by
her
satin
bodice
,
which
was
covered
with
mud
,
and
*NL*
said
to
her
,
``
Follow
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
raised
her
head
;
her
furious
voice
suddenly
died
away
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
were
glassy
;
she
turned
pale
instead
of
livid
,
and
she
trembled
*NL*
with
a
quiver
of
terror
.
She
had
recognized
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dandy
took
advantage
of
the
incident
to
make
his
escape
.

CHAPTER
XIII
--
THE
SOLUTION
OF
SOME
QUESTIONS
CONNECTED
WITH
THE
*NL*
MUNICIPAL
POLICE
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
thrust
aside
the
spectators
,
broke
the
circle
,
and
set
out
*NL*
with
long
strides
towards
the
police
station
,
which
is
situated
at
the
*NL*
extremity
of
the
square
,
dragging
the
wretched
woman
after
him
.
She
*NL*
yielded
mechanically
.
Neither
he
nor
she
uttered
a
word
.
The
cloud
of
*NL*
spectators
followed
,
jesting
,
in
a
paroxysm
of
delight
.
Supreme
misery
*NL*
an
occasion
for
obscenity
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
police
station
,
which
was
a
low
room
,
warmed
by
a
*NL*
stove
,
with
a
glazed
and
grated
door
opening
on
the
street
,
and
guarded
*NL*
by
a
detachment
,
Javert
opened
the
door
,
entered
with
Fantine
,
and
shut
*NL*
the
door
behind
him
,
to
the
great
disappointment
of
the
curious
,
who
*NL*
raised
themselves
on
tiptoe
,
and
craned
their
necks
in
front
of
the
*NL*
thick
glass
of
the
station-house
,
in
their
effort
to
see
.
Curiosity
is
a
*NL*
sort
of
gluttony
.
To
see
is
to
devour
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
entering
,
Fantine
fell
down
in
a
corner
,
motionless
and
mute
,
*NL*
crouching
down
like
a
terrified
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
of
the
guard
brought
a
lighted
candle
to
the
table
.
Javert
*NL*
seated
himself
,
drew
a
sheet
of
stamped
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
began
*NL*
to
write
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
class
of
women
is
consigned
by
our
laws
entirely
to
the
discretion
*NL*
of
the
police
.
The
latter
do
what
they
please
,
punish
them
,
as
seems
*NL*
good
to
them
,
and
confiscate
at
their
will
those
two
sorry
things
which
*NL*
they
entitle
their
industry
and
their
liberty
.
Javert
was
impassive
;
his
*NL*
grave
face
betrayed
no
emotion
whatever
.
Nevertheless
,
he
was
seriously
*NL*
and
deeply
preoccupied
.
It
was
one
of
those
moments
when
he
was
*NL*
exercising
without
control
,
but
subject
to
all
the
scruples
of
a
severe
*NL*
conscience
,
his
redoubtable
discretionary
power
.
At
that
moment
he
was
*NL*
conscious
that
his
police
agent
's
stool
was
a
tribunal
.
He
was
entering
*NL*
judgment
.
He
judged
and
condemned
.
He
summoned
all
the
ideas
which
could
*NL*
possibly
exist
in
his
mind
,
around
the
great
thing
which
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
The
more
he
examined
the
deed
of
this
woman
,
the
more
shocked
he
felt
.
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
he
had
just
witnessed
the
commission
of
a
crime
.
*NL*
He
had
just
beheld
,
yonder
,
in
the
street
,
society
,
in
the
person
of
a
*NL*
freeholder
and
an
elector
,
insulted
and
attacked
by
a
creature
who
was
*NL*
outside
all
pales
.
A
prostitute
had
made
an
attempt
on
the
life
of
a
*NL*
citizen
.
He
had
seen
that
,
he
,
Javert
.
He
wrote
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
he
signed
the
paper
,
folded
it
,
and
said
to
the
*NL*
sergeant
of
the
guard
,
as
he
handed
it
to
him
,
``
Take
three
men
and
*NL*
conduct
this
creature
to
jail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
turning
to
Fantine
,
``
You
are
to
have
six
months
of
it
.
''
The
*NL*
unhappy
woman
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
months
!
six
months
of
prison
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
``
Six
months
in
which
*NL*
to
earn
seven
sous
a
day
!
But
what
will
become
of
Cosette
?
My
daughter
!
*NL*
my
daughter
!
But
I
still
owe
the
Thenardiers
over
a
hundred
francs
;
do
*NL*
you
know
that
,
Monsieur
Inspector
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dragged
herself
across
the
damp
floor
,
among
the
muddy
boots
of
all
*NL*
those
men
,
without
rising
,
with
clasped
hands
,
and
taking
great
strides
*NL*
on
her
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Javert
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
beseech
your
mercy
.
I
assure
you
that
*NL*
I
was
not
in
the
wrong
.
If
you
had
seen
the
beginning
,
you
would
have
*NL*
seen
.
I
swear
to
you
by
the
good
God
that
I
was
not
to
blame
!
That
*NL*
gentleman
,
the
bourgeois
,
whom
I
do
not
know
,
put
snow
in
my
back
.
Has
*NL*
any
one
the
right
to
put
snow
down
our
backs
when
we
are
walking
along
*NL*
peaceably
,
and
doing
no
harm
to
any
one
?
I
am
rather
ill
,
as
you
see
.
*NL*
And
then
,
he
had
been
saying
impertinent
things
to
me
for
a
long
time
:
*NL*
`
You
are
ugly
!
you
have
no
teeth
!
'
I
know
well
that
I
have
no
longer
*NL*
those
teeth
.
I
did
nothing
;
I
said
to
myself
,
`
The
gentleman
is
amusing
*NL*
himself
.
'
I
was
honest
with
him
;
I
did
not
speak
to
him
.
It
was
at
that
*NL*
moment
that
he
put
the
snow
down
my
back
.
Monsieur
Javert
,
good
Monsieur
*NL*
Inspector
!
is
there
not
some
person
here
who
saw
it
and
can
tell
you
*NL*
that
this
is
quite
true
?
Perhaps
I
did
wrong
to
get
angry
.
You
know
that
*NL*
one
is
not
master
of
one
's
self
at
the
first
moment
.
One
gives
way
to
*NL*
vivacity
;
and
then
,
when
some
one
puts
something
cold
down
your
*NL*
back
just
when
you
are
not
expecting
it
!
I
did
wrong
to
spoil
that
*NL*
gentleman
's
hat
.
Why
did
he
go
away
?
I
would
ask
his
pardon
.
Oh
,
my
God
!
*NL*
It
makes
no
difference
to
me
whether
I
ask
his
pardon
.
Do
me
the
favor
*NL*
to-day
,
for
this
once
,
Monsieur
Javert
.
Hold
!
you
do
not
know
that
in
*NL*
prison
one
can
earn
only
seven
sous
a
day
;
it
is
not
the
government
's
*NL*
fault
,
but
seven
sous
is
one
's
earnings
;
and
just
fancy
,
I
must
pay
*NL*
one
hundred
francs
,
or
my
little
girl
will
be
sent
to
me
.
Oh
,
my
God
!
*NL*
I
can
not
have
her
with
me
.
What
I
do
is
so
vile
!
Oh
,
my
Cosette
!
Oh
,
my
*NL*
little
angel
of
the
Holy
Virgin
!
what
will
become
of
her
,
poor
creature
?
*NL*
I
will
tell
you
:
it
is
the
Thenardiers
,
inn-keepers
,
peasants
;
and
such
*NL*
people
are
unreasonable
.
They
want
money
.
Do
n't
put
me
in
prison
!
You
*NL*
see
,
there
is
a
little
girl
who
will
be
turned
out
into
the
street
to
*NL*
get
along
as
best
she
may
,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
winter
;
and
you
must
*NL*
have
pity
on
such
a
being
,
my
good
Monsieur
Javert
.
If
she
were
older
,
*NL*
she
might
earn
her
living
;
but
it
can
not
be
done
at
that
age
.
I
am
not
a
*NL*
bad
woman
at
bottom
.
It
is
not
cowardliness
and
gluttony
that
have
made
*NL*
me
what
I
am
.
If
I
have
drunk
brandy
,
it
was
out
of
misery
.
I
do
not
*NL*
love
it
;
but
it
benumbs
the
senses
.
When
I
was
happy
,
it
was
only
*NL*
necessary
to
glance
into
my
closets
,
and
it
would
have
been
evident
that
*NL*
I
was
not
a
coquettish
and
untidy
woman
.
I
had
linen
,
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
linen
.
Have
pity
on
me
,
Monsieur
Javert
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
thus
,
rent
in
twain
,
shaken
with
sobs
,
blinded
with
tears
,
*NL*
her
neck
bare
,
wringing
her
hands
,
and
coughing
with
a
dry
,
short
cough
,
*NL*
stammering
softly
with
a
voice
of
agony
.
Great
sorrow
is
a
divine
and
*NL*
terrible
ray
,
which
transfigures
the
unhappy
.
At
that
moment
Fantine
had
*NL*
become
beautiful
once
more
.
From
time
to
time
she
paused
,
and
tenderly
*NL*
kissed
the
police
agent
's
coat
.
She
would
have
softened
a
heart
of
*NL*
granite
;
but
a
heart
of
wood
can
not
be
softened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
said
Javert
,
``
I
have
heard
you
out
.
Have
you
entirely
finished
?
*NL*
You
will
get
six
months
.
Now
march
!
The
Eternal
Father
in
person
could
*NL*
do
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
solemn
words
,
``
the
Eternal
Father
in
person
could
do
nothing
*NL*
more
,
''
she
understood
that
her
fate
was
sealed
.
She
sank
down
,
*NL*
murmuring
,
``
Mercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
turned
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
seized
her
by
the
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
earlier
a
man
had
entered
,
but
no
one
had
paid
any
heed
*NL*
to
him
.
He
shut
the
door
,
leaned
his
back
against
it
,
and
listened
to
*NL*
Fantine
's
despairing
supplications
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
instant
when
the
soldiers
laid
their
hands
upon
the
unfortunate
*NL*
woman
,
who
would
not
rise
,
he
emerged
from
the
shadow
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
moment
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
raised
his
eyes
and
recognized
M.
Madeleine
.
He
removed
his
hat
,
*NL*
and
,
saluting
him
with
a
sort
of
aggrieved
awkwardness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Mayor
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
``
Mr.
Mayor
''
produced
a
curious
effect
upon
Fantine
.
She
rose
*NL*
to
her
feet
with
one
bound
,
like
a
spectre
springing
from
the
earth
,
*NL*
thrust
aside
the
soldiers
with
both
arms
,
walked
straight
up
to
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
before
any
one
could
prevent
her
,
and
gazing
intently
at
him
,
*NL*
with
a
bewildered
air
,
she
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
it
is
you
who
are
M.
le
Maire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
burst
into
a
laugh
,
and
spit
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
wiped
his
face
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inspector
Javert
,
set
this
woman
at
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
felt
that
he
was
on
the
verge
of
going
mad
.
He
experienced
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
blow
upon
blow
and
almost
simultaneously
,
the
most
violent
*NL*
emotions
which
he
had
ever
undergone
in
all
his
life
.
To
see
a
woman
of
*NL*
the
town
spit
in
the
mayor
's
face
was
a
thing
so
monstrous
that
,
in
his
*NL*
most
daring
flights
of
fancy
,
he
would
have
regarded
it
as
a
sacrilege
*NL*
to
believe
it
possible
.
On
the
other
hand
,
at
the
very
bottom
of
his
*NL*
thought
,
he
made
a
hideous
comparison
as
to
what
this
woman
was
,
and
as
*NL*
to
what
this
mayor
might
be
;
and
then
he
,
with
horror
,
caught
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
I
know
not
what
simple
explanation
of
this
prodigious
attack
.
But
*NL*
when
he
beheld
that
mayor
,
that
magistrate
,
calmly
wipe
his
face
and
*NL*
say
,
``
Set
this
woman
at
liberty
,
''
he
underwent
a
sort
of
intoxication
*NL*
of
amazement
;
thought
and
word
failed
him
equally
;
the
sum
total
of
*NL*
possible
astonishment
had
been
exceeded
in
his
case
.
He
remained
mute
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
had
produced
no
less
strange
an
effect
on
Fantine
.
She
raised
*NL*
her
bare
arm
,
and
clung
to
the
damper
of
the
stove
,
like
a
person
who
*NL*
is
reeling
.
Nevertheless
,
she
glanced
about
her
,
and
began
to
speak
in
a
*NL*
low
voice
,
as
though
talking
to
herself

``
At
liberty
!
I
am
to
be
allowed
to
go
!
I
am
not
to
go
to
prison
for
six
*NL*
months
!
Who
said
that
?
It
is
not
possible
that
any
one
could
have
said
*NL*
that
.
I
did
not
hear
aright
.
It
can
not
have
been
that
monster
of
a
*NL*
mayor
!
Was
it
you
,
my
good
Monsieur
Javert
,
who
said
that
I
was
to
be
*NL*
set
free
?
Oh
,
see
here
!
I
will
tell
you
about
it
,
and
you
will
let
me
*NL*
go
.
That
monster
of
a
mayor
,
that
old
blackguard
of
a
mayor
,
is
the
*NL*
cause
of
all
.
Just
imagine
,
Monsieur
Javert
,
he
turned
me
out
!
all
*NL*
because
of
a
pack
of
rascally
women
,
who
gossip
in
the
workroom
.
If
that
*NL*
is
not
a
horror
,
what
is
?
To
dismiss
a
poor
girl
who
is
doing
her
*NL*
work
honestly
!
Then
I
could
no
longer
earn
enough
,
and
all
this
misery
*NL*
followed
.
In
the
first
place
,
there
is
one
improvement
which
these
*NL*
gentlemen
of
the
police
ought
to
make
,
and
that
is
,
to
prevent
prison
*NL*
contractors
from
wronging
poor
people
.
I
will
explain
it
to
you
,
you
*NL*
see
:
you
are
earning
twelve
sous
at
shirt-making
,
the
price
falls
to
*NL*
nine
sous
;
and
it
is
not
enough
to
live
on
.
Then
one
has
to
become
*NL*
whatever
one
can
.
As
for
me
,
I
had
my
little
Cosette
,
and
I
was
actually
*NL*
forced
to
become
a
bad
woman
.
Now
you
understand
how
it
is
that
that
*NL*
blackguard
of
a
mayor
caused
all
the
mischief
.
After
that
I
stamped
on
*NL*
that
gentleman
's
hat
in
front
of
the
officers
'
cafe
;
but
he
had
spoiled
*NL*
my
whole
dress
with
snow
.
We
women
have
but
one
silk
dress
for
evening
*NL*
wear
.
You
see
that
I
did
not
do
wrong
deliberately
--
truly
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Javert
;
and
everywhere
I
behold
women
who
are
far
more
wicked
than
I
,
*NL*
and
who
are
much
happier
.
O
Monsieur
Javert
!
it
was
you
who
gave
orders
*NL*
that
I
am
to
be
set
free
,
was
it
not
?
Make
inquiries
,
speak
to
my
*NL*
landlord
;
I
am
paying
my
rent
now
;
they
will
tell
you
that
I
am
*NL*
perfectly
honest
.
Ah
!
my
God
!
I
beg
your
pardon
;
I
have
unintentionally
*NL*
touched
the
damper
of
the
stove
,
and
it
has
made
it
smoke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
listened
to
her
with
profound
attention
.
While
she
was
*NL*
speaking
,
he
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
,
drew
out
his
purse
and
opened
*NL*
it
.
It
was
empty
.
He
put
it
back
in
his
pocket
.
He
said
to
Fantine
,
``
How
*NL*
much
did
you
say
that
you
owed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
,
who
was
looking
at
Javert
only
,
turned
towards
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
I
speaking
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
addressing
the
soldiers
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
you
fellows
,
did
you
see
how
I
spit
in
his
face
?
Ah
!
you
old
*NL*
wretch
of
a
mayor
,
you
came
here
to
frighten
me
,
but
I
'm
not
afraid
of
*NL*
you
.
I
am
afraid
of
Monsieur
Javert
.
I
am
afraid
of
my
good
Monsieur
*NL*
Javert
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
turned
to
the
inspector
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
you
see
,
Mr.
Inspector
,
it
is
necessary
to
be
just
.
I
*NL*
understand
that
you
are
just
,
Mr.
Inspector
;
in
fact
,
it
is
perfectly
*NL*
simple
:
a
man
amuses
himself
by
putting
snow
down
a
woman
's
back
,
and
*NL*
that
makes
the
officers
laugh
;
one
must
divert
themselves
in
some
way
;
*NL*
and
we
--
well
,
we
are
here
for
them
to
amuse
themselves
with
,
of
course
!
*NL*
And
then
,
you
,
you
come
;
you
are
certainly
obliged
to
preserve
order
,
*NL*
you
lead
off
the
woman
who
is
in
the
wrong
;
but
on
reflection
,
since
you
*NL*
are
a
good
man
,
you
say
that
I
am
to
be
set
at
liberty
;
it
is
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
the
little
one
,
for
six
months
in
prison
would
prevent
my
*NL*
supporting
my
child
.
`
Only
,
do
n't
do
it
again
,
you
hussy
!
'
Oh
!
I
wo
n't
*NL*
do
it
again
,
Monsieur
Javert
!
They
may
do
whatever
they
please
to
me
*NL*
now
;
I
will
not
stir
.
But
to-day
,
you
see
,
I
cried
because
it
hurt
me
.
*NL*
I
was
not
expecting
that
snow
from
the
gentleman
at
all
;
and
then
as
I
*NL*
told
you
,
I
am
not
well
;
I
have
a
cough
;
I
seem
to
have
a
burning
ball
*NL*
in
my
stomach
,
and
the
doctor
tells
me
,
`
Take
care
of
yourself
.
'
Here
,
*NL*
feel
,
give
me
your
hand
;
do
n't
be
afraid
--
it
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
wept
,
her
voice
was
caressing
;
she
placed
Javert
's
coarse
*NL*
hand
on
her
delicate
,
white
throat
and
looked
smilingly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
rapidly
adjusted
her
disordered
garments
,
dropped
the
*NL*
folds
of
her
skirt
,
which
had
been
pushed
up
as
she
dragged
herself
*NL*
along
,
almost
to
the
height
of
her
knee
,
and
stepped
towards
the
door
,
*NL*
saying
to
the
soldiers
in
a
low
voice
,
and
with
a
friendly
nod
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Children
,
Monsieur
l'Inspecteur
has
said
that
I
am
to
be
released
,
and
*NL*
I
am
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
her
hand
on
the
latch
of
the
door
.
One
step
more
and
she
would
*NL*
be
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
up
to
that
moment
had
remained
erect
,
motionless
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
ground
,
cast
athwart
this
scene
like
some
displaced
statue
,
*NL*
which
is
waiting
to
be
put
away
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
the
latch
roused
him
.
He
raised
his
head
with
an
expression
*NL*
of
sovereign
authority
,
an
expression
all
the
more
alarming
in
*NL*
proportion
as
the
authority
rests
on
a
low
level
,
ferocious
in
the
wild
*NL*
beast
,
atrocious
in
the
man
of
no
estate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sergeant
!
''
he
cried
,
``
do
n't
you
see
that
that
jade
is
walking
off
!
Who
*NL*
bade
you
let
her
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
''
said
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
trembled
at
the
sound
of
Javert
's
voice
,
and
let
go
of
the
latch
*NL*
as
a
thief
relinquishes
the
article
which
he
has
stolen
.
At
the
sound
*NL*
of
Madeleine
's
voice
she
turned
around
,
and
from
that
moment
forth
she
*NL*
uttered
no
word
,
nor
dared
so
much
as
to
breathe
freely
,
but
her
glance
*NL*
strayed
from
Madeleine
to
Javert
,
and
from
Javert
to
Madeleine
in
turn
,
*NL*
according
to
which
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
Javert
must
have
been
exasperated
beyond
measure
*NL*
before
he
would
permit
himself
to
apostrophize
the
sergeant
as
he
*NL*
had
done
,
after
the
mayor
's
suggestion
that
Fantine
should
be
set
at
*NL*
liberty
.
Had
he
reached
the
point
of
forgetting
the
mayor
's
presence
?
*NL*
Had
he
finally
declared
to
himself
that
it
was
impossible
that
any
*NL*
``
authority
''
should
have
given
such
an
order
,
and
that
the
mayor
must
*NL*
certainly
have
said
one
thing
by
mistake
for
another
,
without
intending
*NL*
it
?
Or
,
in
view
of
the
enormities
of
which
he
had
been
a
witness
for
the
*NL*
past
two
hours
,
did
he
say
to
himself
,
that
it
was
necessary
to
recur
to
*NL*
supreme
resolutions
,
that
it
was
indispensable
that
the
small
should
*NL*
be
made
great
,
that
the
police
spy
should
transform
himself
into
a
*NL*
magistrate
,
that
the
policeman
should
become
a
dispenser
of
justice
,
and
*NL*
that
,
in
this
prodigious
extremity
,
order
,
law
,
morality
,
government
,
*NL*
society
in
its
entirety
,
was
personified
in
him
,
Javert
?
*NL*
*NL*
However
that
may
be
,
when
M.
Madeleine
uttered
that
word
,
_
I
_
,
as
we
*NL*
have
just
heard
,
Police
Inspector
Javert
was
seen
to
turn
toward
the
*NL*
mayor
,
pale
,
cold
,
with
blue
lips
,
and
a
look
of
despair
,
his
whole
body
*NL*
agitated
by
an
imperceptible
quiver
and
an
unprecedented
occurrence
,
and
*NL*
say
to
him
,
with
downcast
eyes
but
a
firm
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
that
can
not
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
said
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
miserable
woman
has
insulted
a
citizen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inspector
Javert
,
''
replied
the
mayor
,
in
a
calm
and
conciliating
tone
,
*NL*
``
listen
.
You
are
an
honest
man
,
and
I
feel
no
hesitation
in
explaining
*NL*
matters
to
you
.
Here
is
the
true
state
of
the
case
:
I
was
passing
*NL*
through
the
square
just
as
you
were
leading
this
woman
away
;
there
were
*NL*
still
groups
of
people
standing
about
,
and
I
made
inquiries
and
learned
*NL*
everything
;
it
was
the
townsman
who
was
in
the
wrong
and
who
should
have
*NL*
been
arrested
by
properly
conducted
police
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
retorted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
wretch
has
just
insulted
Monsieur
le
Maire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
concerns
me
,
''
said
M.
Madeleine
.
``
My
own
insult
belongs
to
me
,
I
*NL*
think
.
I
can
do
what
I
please
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
Monsieur
le
Maire
's
pardon
.
The
insult
is
not
to
him
but
to
the
*NL*
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inspector
Javert
,
''
replied
M.
Madeleine
,
``
the
highest
law
is
*NL*
conscience
.
I
have
heard
this
woman
;
I
know
what
I
am
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
do
not
know
what
I
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
content
yourself
with
obeying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
obeying
my
duty
.
My
duty
demands
that
this
woman
shall
serve
six
*NL*
months
in
prison

*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
replied
gently
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heed
this
well
;
she
will
not
serve
a
single
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
decisive
word
,
Javert
ventured
to
fix
a
searching
look
on
the
*NL*
mayor
and
to
say
,
but
in
a
tone
of
voice
that
was
still
profoundly
*NL*
respectful
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
oppose
Monsieur
le
Maire
;
it
is
for
the
first
time
in
my
*NL*
life
,
but
he
will
permit
me
to
remark
that
I
am
within
the
bounds
of
my
*NL*
authority
.
I
confine
myself
,
since
Monsieur
le
Maire
desires
it
,
to
the
*NL*
question
of
the
gentleman
.
I
was
present
.
This
woman
flung
herself
*NL*
on
Monsieur
Bamatabnois
,
who
is
an
elector
and
the
proprietor
of
that
*NL*
handsome
house
with
a
balcony
,
which
forms
the
corner
of
the
esplanade
,
*NL*
three
stories
high
and
entirely
of
cut
stone
.
Such
things
as
there
are
*NL*
in
the
world
!
In
any
case
,
Monsieur
le
Maire
,
this
is
a
question
of
*NL*
police
regulations
in
the
streets
,
and
concerns
me
,
and
I
shall
detain
*NL*
this
woman
Fantine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
M.
Madeleine
folded
his
arms
,
and
said
in
a
severe
voice
which
no
*NL*
one
in
the
town
had
heard
hitherto
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
matter
to
which
you
refer
is
one
connected
with
the
municipal
*NL*
police
.
According
to
the
terms
of
articles
nine
,
eleven
,
fifteen
,
and
*NL*
sixty-six
of
the
code
of
criminal
examination
,
I
am
the
judge
.
I
order
*NL*
that
this
woman
shall
be
set
at
liberty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
ventured
to
make
a
final
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mr.
Mayor
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
refer
you
to
article
eighty-one
of
the
law
of
the
13th
of
December
,
*NL*
1799
,
in
regard
to
arbitrary
detention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Maire
,
permit
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
another
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
the
room
,
''
said
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
received
the
blow
erect
,
full
in
the
face
,
in
his
breast
,
like
*NL*
a
Russian
soldier
.
He
bowed
to
the
very
earth
before
the
mayor
and
left
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
stood
aside
from
the
door
and
stared
at
him
in
amazement
as
he
*NL*
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
she
also
was
the
prey
to
a
strange
confusion
.
She
had
just
*NL*
seen
herself
a
subject
of
dispute
between
two
opposing
powers
.
She
had
*NL*
seen
two
men
who
held
in
their
hands
her
liberty
,
her
life
,
her
soul
,
*NL*
her
child
,
in
combat
before
her
very
eyes
;
one
of
these
men
was
drawing
*NL*
her
towards
darkness
,
the
other
was
leading
her
back
towards
the
light
.
*NL*
In
this
conflict
,
viewed
through
the
exaggerations
of
terror
,
these
two
*NL*
men
had
appeared
to
her
like
two
giants
;
the
one
spoke
like
her
demon
,
*NL*
the
other
like
her
good
angel
.
The
angel
had
conquered
the
demon
,
and
,
*NL*
strange
to
say
,
that
which
made
her
shudder
from
head
to
foot
was
*NL*
the
fact
that
this
angel
,
this
liberator
,
was
the
very
man
whom
she
*NL*
abhorred
,
that
mayor
whom
she
had
so
long
regarded
as
the
author
of
all
*NL*
her
woes
,
that
Madeleine
!
And
at
the
very
moment
when
she
had
insulted
*NL*
him
in
so
hideous
a
fashion
,
he
had
saved
her
!
Had
she
,
then
,
been
*NL*
mistaken
?
Must
she
change
her
whole
soul
?
She
did
not
know
;
she
*NL*
trembled
.
She
listened
in
bewilderment
,
she
looked
on
in
affright
,
and
*NL*
at
every
word
uttered
by
M.
Madeleine
she
felt
the
frightful
shades
of
*NL*
hatred
crumble
and
melt
within
her
,
and
something
warm
and
ineffable
,
*NL*
indescribable
,
which
was
both
joy
,
confidence
and
love
,
dawn
in
her
*NL*
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Javert
had
taken
his
departure
,
M.
Madeleine
turned
to
her
and
said
*NL*
to
her
in
a
deliberate
voice
,
like
a
serious
man
who
does
not
wish
to
*NL*
weep
and
who
finds
some
difficulty
in
speaking
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
you
.
I
knew
nothing
about
what
you
have
mentioned
.
I
*NL*
believe
that
it
is
true
,
and
I
feel
that
it
is
true
.
I
was
even
ignorant
*NL*
of
the
fact
that
you
had
left
my
shop
.
Why
did
you
not
apply
to
me
?
But
*NL*
here
;
I
will
pay
your
debts
,
I
will
send
for
your
child
,
or
you
shall
go
*NL*
to
her
.
You
shall
live
here
,
in
Paris
,
or
where
you
please
.
I
undertake
*NL*
the
care
of
your
child
and
yourself
.
You
shall
not
work
any
longer
if
*NL*
you
do
not
like
.
I
will
give
all
the
money
you
require
.
You
shall
be
*NL*
honest
and
happy
once
more
.
And
listen
!
I
declare
to
you
that
if
all
*NL*
is
as
you
say
,
--
and
I
do
not
doubt
it
,
--
you
have
never
ceased
to
be
*NL*
virtuous
and
holy
in
the
sight
of
God
.
Oh
!
poor
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
more
than
Fantine
could
bear
.
To
have
Cosette
!
To
leave
this
*NL*
life
of
infamy
.
To
live
free
,
rich
,
happy
,
respectable
with
Cosette
;
to
*NL*
see
all
these
realities
of
paradise
blossom
of
a
sudden
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
her
misery
.
She
stared
stupidly
at
this
man
who
was
talking
to
her
,
and
*NL*
could
only
give
vent
to
two
or
three
sobs
,
``
Oh
!
Oh
!
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
limbs
gave
way
beneath
her
,
she
knelt
in
front
of
M.
Madeleine
,
and
*NL*
before
he
could
prevent
her
he
felt
her
grasp
his
hand
and
press
her
*NL*
lips
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
fainted

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
BEGINNING
OF
REPOSE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
had
Fantine
removed
to
that
infirmary
which
he
had
*NL*
established
in
his
own
house
.
He
confided
her
to
the
sisters
,
who
put
*NL*
her
to
bed
.
A
burning
fever
had
come
on
.
She
passed
a
part
of
the
night
*NL*
in
delirium
and
raving
.
At
length
,
however
,
she
fell
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
towards
midday
,
Fantine
awoke
.
She
heard
some
one
*NL*
breathing
close
to
her
bed
;
she
drew
aside
the
curtain
and
saw
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
standing
there
and
looking
at
something
over
her
head
.
His
*NL*
gaze
was
full
of
pity
,
anguish
,
and
supplication
.
She
followed
its
*NL*
direction
,
and
saw
that
it
was
fixed
on
a
crucifix
which
was
nailed
to
*NL*
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenceforth
,
M.
Madeleine
was
transfigured
in
Fantine
's
eyes
.
He
seemed
*NL*
to
her
to
be
clothed
in
light
.
He
was
absorbed
in
a
sort
of
prayer
.
She
*NL*
gazed
at
him
for
a
long
time
without
daring
to
interrupt
him
.
At
last
*NL*
she
said
timidly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
had
been
there
for
an
hour
.
He
had
been
waiting
for
Fantine
*NL*
to
awake
.
He
took
her
hand
,
felt
of
her
pulse
,
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
slept
,
''
she
replied
;
``
I
think
that
I
am
better
,
It
is
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
,
responding
to
the
first
question
which
she
had
put
to
him
*NL*
as
though
he
had
just
heard
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
praying
to
the
martyr
there
on
high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
in
his
own
mind
,
``
For
the
martyr
here
below
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
had
passed
the
night
and
the
morning
in
making
inquiries
.
*NL*
He
knew
all
now
.
He
knew
Fantine
's
history
in
all
its
heart-rending
*NL*
details
.
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
suffered
much
,
poor
mother
.
Oh
!
do
not
complain
;
you
now
have
*NL*
the
dowry
of
the
elect
.
It
is
thus
that
men
are
transformed
into
angels
.
*NL*
It
is
not
their
fault
they
do
not
know
how
to
go
to
work
otherwise
.
*NL*
You
see
this
hell
from
which
you
have
just
emerged
is
the
first
form
of
*NL*
heaven
.
It
was
necessary
to
begin
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sighed
deeply
.
But
she
smiled
on
him
with
that
sublime
smile
in
which
*NL*
two
teeth
were
lacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
night
,
Javert
wrote
a
letter
.
The
next
morning
be
posted
it
*NL*
himself
at
the
office
of
M.
sur
M
.
It
was
addressed
to
Paris
,
and
the
*NL*
superscription
ran
:
To
Monsieur
Chabouillet
,
Secretary
of
Monsieur
le
*NL*
Prefet
of
Police
.
As
the
affair
in
the
station-house
had
been
bruited
*NL*
about
,
the
post-mistress
and
some
other
persons
who
saw
the
letter
*NL*
before
it
was
sent
off
,
and
who
recognized
Javert
's
handwriting
on
the
*NL*
cover
,
thought
that
he
was
sending
in
his
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
made
haste
to
write
to
the
Thenardiers
.
Fantine
owed
*NL*
them
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
.
He
sent
them
three
hundred
francs
,
*NL*
telling
them
to
pay
themselves
from
that
sum
,
and
to
fetch
the
child
*NL*
instantly
to
M.
sur
M.
,
where
her
sick
mother
required
her
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dazzled
Thenardier
.
``
The
devil
!
''
said
the
man
to
his
wife
;
``
do
n't
*NL*
let
's
allow
the
child
to
go
.
This
lark
is
going
to
turn
into
a
milch
*NL*
cow
.
I
see
through
it
.
Some
ninny
has
taken
a
fancy
to
the
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
with
a
very
well
drawn-up
bill
for
five
hundred
and
some
odd
*NL*
francs
.
In
this
memorandum
two
indisputable
items
figured
up
over
three
*NL*
hundred
francs
,
--
one
for
the
doctor
,
the
other
for
the
apothecary
*NL*
who
had
attended
and
physicked
Eponine
and
Azelma
through
two
long
*NL*
illnesses
.
Cosette
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
had
not
been
ill
.
It
was
*NL*
only
a
question
of
a
trifling
substitution
of
names
.
At
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
memorandum
Thenardier
wrote
,
Received
on
account
,
three
hundred
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
immediately
sent
three
hundred
francs
more
,
and
wrote
,
*NL*
``
Make
haste
to
bring
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christi
!
''
said
Thenardier
,
``
let
's
not
give
up
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Fantine
did
not
recover
.
She
still
remained
in
the
*NL*
infirmary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sisters
had
at
first
only
received
and
nursed
``
that
woman
''
with
*NL*
repugnance
.
Those
who
have
seen
the
bas-reliefs
of
Rheims
will
recall
*NL*
the
inflation
of
the
lower
lip
of
the
wise
virgins
as
they
survey
the
*NL*
foolish
virgins
.
The
ancient
scorn
of
the
vestals
for
the
ambubajae
is
*NL*
one
of
the
most
profound
instincts
of
feminine
dignity
;
the
sisters
*NL*
felt
it
with
the
double
force
contributed
by
religion
.
But
in
a
few
days
*NL*
Fantine
disarmed
them
.
She
said
all
kinds
of
humble
and
gentle
things
,
*NL*
and
the
mother
in
her
provoked
tenderness
.
One
day
the
sisters
heard
*NL*
her
say
amid
her
fever
:
``
I
have
been
a
sinner
;
but
when
I
have
my
child
*NL*
beside
me
,
it
will
be
a
sign
that
God
has
pardoned
me
.
While
I
was
*NL*
leading
a
bad
life
,
I
should
not
have
liked
to
have
my
Cosette
with
me
;
*NL*
I
could
not
have
borne
her
sad
,
astonished
eyes
.
It
was
for
her
sake
*NL*
that
I
did
evil
,
and
that
is
why
God
pardons
me
.
I
shall
feel
the
*NL*
benediction
of
the
good
God
when
Cosette
is
here
.
I
shall
gaze
at
her
;
*NL*
it
will
do
me
good
to
see
that
innocent
creature
.
She
knows
nothing
at
*NL*
all
.
She
is
an
angel
,
you
see
,
my
sisters
.
At
that
age
the
wings
have
*NL*
not
fallen
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
went
to
see
her
twice
a
day
,
and
each
time
she
asked
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
see
my
Cosette
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
,
perhaps
.
She
may
arrive
at
any
moment
.
I
am
expecting
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
mother
's
pale
face
grew
radiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
,
``
how
happy
I
am
going
to
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
just
said
that
she
did
not
recover
her
health
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
her
condition
seemed
to
become
more
grave
from
week
to
week
.
That
*NL*
handful
of
snow
applied
to
her
bare
skin
between
her
shoulder-blades
had
*NL*
brought
about
a
sudden
suppression
of
perspiration
,
as
a
consequence
of
*NL*
which
the
malady
which
had
been
smouldering
within
her
for
many
years
*NL*
was
violently
developed
at
last
.
At
that
time
people
were
beginning
to
*NL*
follow
the
fine
Laennec
's
fine
suggestions
in
the
study
and
treatment
of
*NL*
chest
maladies
.
The
doctor
sounded
Fantine
's
chest
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
said
to
the
doctor
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
she
not
a
child
which
she
desires
to
see
?
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
Make
haste
and
get
it
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
the
doctor
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
forced
himself
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
that
your
child
was
to
be
brought
speedily
.
That
that
would
*NL*
restore
your
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
rejoined
,
``
he
is
right
!
But
what
do
those
Thenardiers
mean
*NL*
by
keeping
my
Cosette
from
me
!
Oh
!
she
is
coming
.
At
last
I
behold
*NL*
happiness
close
beside
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
Thenardier
did
not
``
let
go
of
the
child
,
''
and
gave
a
*NL*
hundred
insufficient
reasons
for
it
.
Cosette
was
not
quite
well
enough
*NL*
to
take
a
journey
in
the
winter
.
And
then
,
there
still
remained
some
*NL*
petty
but
pressing
debts
in
the
neighborhood
,
and
they
were
collecting
*NL*
the
bills
for
them
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
send
some
one
to
fetch
Cosette
!
''
said
Father
Madeleine
.
``
If
*NL*
necessary
,
I
will
go
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wrote
the
following
letter
to
Fantine
's
dictation
,
and
made
her
sign
*NL*
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MONSIEUR
THENARDIER
:
--
*NL*
You
will
deliver
Cosette
to
this
person

*NL*
You
will
be
paid
for
all
the
little
things
.
*NL*
I
have
the
honor
to
salute
you
with
respect
.
*NL*
``
FANTINE

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
a
serious
incident
occurred
.
Carve
as
we
will
the
*NL*
mysterious
block
of
which
our
life
is
made
,
the
black
vein
of

*NL*
constantly
reappears
in
it

CHAPTER
II
--
HOW
JEAN
MAY
BECOME
CHAMP
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
M.
Madeleine
was
in
his
study
,
occupied
in
arranging
in
*NL*
advance
some
pressing
matters
connected
with
the
mayor
's
office
,
in
case
*NL*
he
should
decide
to
take
the
trip
to
Montfermeil
,
when
he
was
informed
*NL*
that
Police
Inspector
Javert
was
desirous
of
speaking
with
him
.
*NL*
Madeleine
could
not
refrain
from
a
disagreeable
impression
on
hearing
*NL*
this
name
.
Javert
had
avoided
him
more
than
ever
since
the
affair
of
the
*NL*
police-station
,
and
M.
Madeleine
had
not
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Admit
him
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
had
retained
his
seat
near
the
fire
,
pen
in
hand
,
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
docket
which
he
was
turning
over
and
annotating
,
and
which
*NL*
contained
the
trials
of
the
commission
on
highways
for
the
infraction
of
*NL*
police
regulations
.
He
did
not
disturb
himself
on
Javert
's
account
.
He
*NL*
could
not
help
thinking
of
poor
Fantine
,
and
it
suited
him
to
be
glacial
*NL*
in
his
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
bestowed
a
respectful
salute
on
the
mayor
,
whose
back
was
turned
*NL*
to
him
.
The
mayor
did
not
look
at
him
,
but
went
on
annotating
this
*NL*
docket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
advanced
two
or
three
paces
into
the
study
,
and
halted
,
without
*NL*
breaking
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
any
physiognomist
who
had
been
familiar
with
Javert
,
and
who
had
*NL*
made
a
lengthy
study
of
this
savage
in
the
service
of
civilization
,
*NL*
this
singular
composite
of
the
Roman
,
the
Spartan
,
the
monk
,
and
the
*NL*
corporal
,
this
spy
who
was
incapable
of
a
lie
,
this
unspotted
police
*NL*
agent
--
if
any
physiognomist
had
known
his
secret
and
long-cherished
*NL*
aversion
for
M.
Madeleine
,
his
conflict
with
the
mayor
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
Fantine
,
and
had
examined
Javert
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
What
has
taken
place
?
''
It
was
evident
to
any
one
acquainted
*NL*
with
that
clear
,
upright
,
sincere
,
honest
,
austere
,
and
ferocious
*NL*
conscience
,
that
Javert
had
but
just
gone
through
some
great
interior
*NL*
struggle
.
Javert
had
nothing
in
his
soul
which
he
had
not
also
in
his
*NL*
countenance
.
Like
violent
people
in
general
,
he
was
subject
to
abrupt
*NL*
changes
of
opinion
.
His
physiognomy
had
never
been
more
peculiar
and
*NL*
startling
.
On
entering
he
bowed
to
M.
Madeleine
with
a
look
in
which
*NL*
there
was
neither
rancor
,
anger
,
nor
distrust
;
he
halted
a
few
paces
in
*NL*
the
rear
of
the
mayor
's
arm-chair
,
and
there
he
stood
,
perfectly
erect
,
*NL*
in
an
attitude
almost
of
discipline
,
with
the
cold
,
ingenuous
roughness
*NL*
of
a
man
who
has
never
been
gentle
and
who
has
always
been
patient
;
he
*NL*
waited
without
uttering
a
word
,
without
making
a
movement
,
in
genuine
*NL*
humility
and
tranquil
resignation
,
calm
,
serious
,
hat
in
hand
,
with
*NL*
eyes
cast
down
,
and
an
expression
which
was
half-way
between
that
of
a
*NL*
soldier
in
the
presence
of
his
officer
and
a
criminal
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
his
judge
,
until
it
should
please
the
mayor
to
turn
round
.
All
the
*NL*
sentiments
as
well
as
all
the
memories
which
one
might
have
attributed
*NL*
to
him
had
disappeared
.
That
face
,
as
impenetrable
and
simple
as
*NL*
granite
,
no
longer
bore
any
trace
of
anything
but
a
melancholy
*NL*
depression
.
His
whole
person
breathed
lowliness
and
firmness
and
an
*NL*
indescribable
courageous
despondency
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
mayor
laid
down
his
pen
and
turned
half
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
What
is
it
?
What
is
the
matter
,
Javert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
remained
silent
for
an
instant
as
though
collecting
his
ideas
,
*NL*
then
raised
his
voice
with
a
sort
of
sad
solemnity
,
which
did
not
,
*NL*
however
,
preclude
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
matter
,
Mr.
Mayor
;
a
culpable
act
has
been
committed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
act
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
inferior
agent
of
the

.
I
have
come
to
bring
the
fact

*NL*
your
knowledge

it
is
my
duty
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is

asked
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*

Javert

``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
sat
erect
in
his
arm-chair
.
Javert
went
on
,
with
a
severe
*NL*
air
and
his
eyes
still
cast
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
I
have
come
to
request
you
to
instigate
the
authorities
to

dismiss
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
opened
his
mouth
in
amazement
.
Javert
interrupted
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
say
that
I
might
have
handed
in
my
resignation
,
but
that
does
*NL*
not
suffice

Handing
in
one
's
resignation
is
honorable

I
have
failed
in
*NL*
my
duty

I
ought
to
be
punished
;
I
must
be
turned
out

*NL*
*NL*
And
after
a
pause
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

were
severe
with

*NL*
*NL*
``

exclaimed
M.
Madeleine
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Turned

said
Javert

*NL*
*NL*
``
Turned

That
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
understand

*NL*
*NL*
Javert
sighed
from
the
very
bottom
of
his
chest
,
and
resumed
,
still
*NL*
coldly
and
sadly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

six
weeks
ago
,
in

scene
over

I
informed
against

*NL*
*NL*
``
Informed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At

*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
,
who
was
not
in
the
habit
of
laughing
much
oftener
than
*NL*
Javert
himself
,
burst
out
laughing
now
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
mayor
who
had
encroached
on
the
province

the
police

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mayor
turned
livid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
,
who
had
not
raised
his
eyes
,
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
so

had
an

a
long

which
you
had
caused

I
hardly

I
took

*NL*
``
A

What
did
you
say
the
name
was

*NL*
*NL*
``
Jean

He
was
a
convict

I
was
in
the
habit
of
seeing
twenty
*NL*
years
ago
,
when
I
was
adjutant-guard
of
convicts
at
Toulon
.
On
leaving
*NL*
the
galleys
,
this
Jean
Valjean
,
as
it
appears
,
robbed
a
bishop
;
then
he

committed
another
theft
,
accompanied
with
violence
,
on
a
public
highway
*NL*
on
the
person
of
a
little
Savoyard

He
disappeared
eight
years

,
no
*NL*
one
knows
how
,
and
he
has
been
sought
,
I
fancied
.
In
short
,
I
did
this
*NL*
thing
!
Wrath
impelled
me
;
I
denounced

at
the
Prefecture

*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
,
who
had
taken
up
the
docket
again
several
moments
before
*NL*
this
,
resumed
with
an
air
of
perfect
indifference
:

*NL*
*NL*

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
lucky
that
you
recognize
the
fact

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
forced
to
do
so
,
since
the
real
Jean
Valjean
has
been
found
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sheet
of
paper
which
M.
Madeleine
was
holding
dropped
from
his
*NL*
hand
;
he
raised
his
head
,
gazed
fixedly
at
Javert
,
and
said
with
his
*NL*
indescribable
accent
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
way
it
is
,
Mr.
Mayor
.
It
seems
that
there
was
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
near
Ailly-le-Haut-Clocher
an
old
fellow
who
was
called
*NL*
Father
Champmathieu
.
He
was
a
very
wretched
creature
.
No
one
paid
any
*NL*
attention
to
him
.
No
one
knows
what
such
people
subsist
on
.
Lately
,
last
*NL*
autumn
,
Father
Champmathieu
was
arrested
for
the
theft
of
some
cider
*NL*
apples
from
--
Well
,
no
matter
,
a
theft
had
been
committed
,
a
wall
scaled
,
*NL*
branches
of
trees
broken
.
My
Champmathieu
was
arrested
.
He
still
had
*NL*
the
branch
of
apple-tree
in
his
hand
.
The
scamp
is
locked
up
.
Up
to
*NL*
this
point
it
was
merely
an
affair
of
a
misdemeanor
.
But
here
is
where
*NL*
Providence
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
jail
being
in
a
bad
condition
,
the
examining
magistrate
finds
it
*NL*
convenient
to
transfer
Champmathieu
to
Arras
,
where
the
departmental
*NL*
prison
is
situated
.
In
this
prison
at
Arras
there
is
an
ex-convict
named
*NL*
Brevet
,
who
is
detained
for
I
know
not
what
,
and
who
has
been
appointed
*NL*
turnkey
of
the
house
,
because
of
good
behavior
.
Mr.
Mayor
,
no
sooner
had
*NL*
Champmathieu
arrived
than
Brevet
exclaims
:
`
Eh
!
Why
,
I
know
that
man
!
*NL*
He
is
a
fagot
!
-LSB-

-RSB-
Take
a
good
look
at
me
,
my
good
man
!
You
are
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
!
'
`
Jean
Valjean
!
who
's
Jean
Valjean
?
'
Champmathieu
feigns
*NL*
astonishment
.
`
Do
n't
play
the
innocent
dodge
,
'
says
Brevet
.
`
You
are
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
!
You
have
been
in
the
galleys
of
Toulon
;
it
was
twenty
*NL*
years
ago
;
we
were
there
together
.
'
Champmathieu
denies
it
.
Parbleu
!
You
*NL*
understand
.
The
case
is
investigated
.
The
thing
was
well
ventilated
for
*NL*
me
.
This
is
what
they
discovered
:
This
Champmathieu
had
been
,
thirty
*NL*
years
ago
,
a
pruner
of
trees
in
various
localities
,
notably
at
*NL*
Faverolles
.
There
all
trace
of
him
was
lost
.
A
long
time
afterwards
he
*NL*
was
seen
again
in
Auvergne
;
then
in
Paris
,
where
he
is
said
to
have
been
*NL*
a
wheelwright
,
and
to
have
had
a
daughter
,
who
was
a
laundress
;
but
that
*NL*
has
not
been
proved
.
Now
,
before
going
to
the
galleys
for
theft
,
what
*NL*
was
Jean
Valjean
?
A
pruner
of
trees
.
Where
?
At
Faverolles
.
Another
fact
.
*NL*
This
Valjean
's
Christian
name
was
Jean
,
and
his
mother
's
surname
was
*NL*
Mathieu
.
What
more
natural
to
suppose
than
that
,
on
emerging
from
the
*NL*
galleys
,
he
should
have
taken
his
mother
's
name
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
concealing
himself
,
and
have
called
himself
Jean
Mathieu
?
He
goes
to
*NL*
Auvergne
.
The
local
pronunciation
turns
Jean
into
Chan
--
he
is
called
*NL*
Chan
Mathieu
.
Our
man
offers
no
opposition
,
and
behold
him
transformed
*NL*
into
Champmathieu
.
You
follow
me
,
do
you
not
?
Inquiries
were
made
at
*NL*
Faverolles
.
The
family
of
Jean
Valjean
is
no
longer
there
.
It
is
not
*NL*
known
where
they
have
gone
.
You
know
that
among
those
classes
a
family
*NL*
often
disappears
.
Search
was
made
,
and
nothing
was
found
.
When
such
*NL*
people
are
not
mud
,
they
are
dust
.
And
then
,
as
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
story
dates
thirty
years
back
,
there
is
no
longer
any
one
at
Faverolles
*NL*
who
knew
Jean
Valjean
.
Inquiries
were
made
at
Toulon
.
Besides
Brevet
,
*NL*
there
are
only
two
convicts
in
existence
who
have
seen
Jean
Valjean
;
*NL*
they
are
Cochepaille
and
Chenildieu
,
and
are
sentenced
for
life
.
*NL*
They
are
taken
from
the
galleys
and
confronted
with
the
pretended
*NL*
Champmathieu
.
They
do
not
hesitate
;
he
is
Jean
Valjean
for
them
as
well
*NL*
as
for
Brevet
.
The
same
age
,
--
he
is
fifty-four
,
--
the
same
height
,
the
*NL*
same
air
,
the
same
man
;
in
short
,
it
is
he
.
It
was
precisely
at
this
*NL*
moment
that
I
forwarded
my
denunciation
to
the
Prefecture
in
Paris
.
I
*NL*
was
told
that
I
had
lost
my
reason
,
and
that
Jean
Valjean
is
at
Arras
,
*NL*
in
the
power
of
the
authorities
.
You
can
imagine
whether
this
surprised
*NL*
me
,
when
I
thought
that
I
had
that
same
Jean
Valjean
here
.
I
write
to
*NL*
the
examining
judge
;
he
sends
for
me
;
Champmathieu
is
conducted
to
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
interposed
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
replied
,
his
face
incorruptible
,
and
as
melancholy
as
ever
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
the
truth
is
the
truth
.
I
am
sorry
;
but
that
man
is
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
I
recognized
him
also

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
resumed
in
,
a
very
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
began
to
laugh
,
with
that
mournful
laugh
which
comes
from
*NL*
profound
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
!
Sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
thoughtfully
for
a
moment
,
mechanically
taking
pinches
of
*NL*
powdered
wood
for
blotting
ink
from
the
wooden
bowl
which
stood
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
even
now
that
I
have
seen
the
real
Jean
Valjean
,
I
do
not
see
how
I
*NL*
could
have
thought
otherwise
.
I
beg
your
pardon
,
Mr.
Mayor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
,
as
he
addressed
these
grave
and
supplicating
words
to
the
man
,
*NL*
who
six
weeks
before
had
humiliated
him
in
the
presence
of
the
whole
*NL*
station-house
,
and
bade
him
``
leave
the
room
,
''
--
Javert
,
that
haughty
man
,
*NL*
was
unconsciously
full
of
simplicity
and
dignity
,
--
M.
Madeleine
made
no
*NL*
other
reply
to
his
prayer
than
the
abrupt
question
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
does
this
man
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Indeed
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
it
's
a
bad
business
.
If
he
is
Jean
Valjean
,
he
*NL*
has
his
previous
conviction
against
him
.
To
climb
a
wall
,
to
break
a
*NL*
branch
,
to
purloin
apples
,
is
a
mischievous
trick
in
a
child
;
for
a
*NL*
man
it
is
a
misdemeanor
;
for
a
convict
it
is
a
crime
.
Robbing
*NL*
and
housebreaking
--
it
is
all
there
.
It
is
no
longer
a
question
of
*NL*
correctional
police
;
it
is
a
matter
for
the
Court
of
Assizes
.
It
is
no
*NL*
longer
a
matter
of
a
few
days
in
prison
;
it
is
the
galleys
for
life
.
And
*NL*
then
,
there
is
the
affair
with
the
little
Savoyard
,
who
will
return
,
I
*NL*
hope
.
The
deuce
!
there
is
plenty
to
dispute
in
the
matter
,
is
there
not
?
*NL*
Yes
,
for
any
one
but
Jean
Valjean
.
But
Jean
Valjean
is
a
sly
dog
.
That
*NL*
is
the
way
I
recognized
him
.
Any
other
man
would
have
felt
that
things
*NL*
were
getting
hot
for
him
;
he
would
struggle
,
he
would
cry
out
--
the
*NL*
kettle
sings
before
the
fire
;
he
would
not
be
Jean
Valjean
,
et
*NL*
cetera
.
But
he
has
not
the
appearance
of
understanding
;
he
says
,
'
I
am
*NL*
Champmathieu
,
and
I
wo
n't
depart
from
that
!
'
He
has
an
astonished
air
,
*NL*
he
pretends
to
be
stupid
;
it
is
far
better
.
Oh
!
the
rogue
is
clever
!
But
*NL*
it
makes
no
difference
.
The
proofs
are
there
.
He
has
been
recognized
by
*NL*
four
persons
;
the
old
scamp
will
be
condemned
.
The
case
has
been
taken
*NL*
to
the
Assizes
at
Arras
.
I
shall
go
there
to
give
my
testimony
.
I
have
*NL*
been
summoned
.

*NL*
M.
Madeleine
had
turned
to
his
desk
again
,
and
taken
up
his
docket
,
and
*NL*
was
turning
over
the
leaves
tranquilly
,
reading
and
writing
by
turns
,
*NL*
like
a
busy
man
.
He
turned
to
Javert
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
Javert
.
In
truth
,
all
these
details
interest
me
but
*NL*
little
.
We
are
wasting
our
time
,
and
we
have
pressing
business
on
hand
.
*NL*
Javert
,
you
will
betake
yourself
at
once
to
the
house
of
the
woman
*NL*
Buseaupied
,
who
sells
herbs
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Saint-Saulve
.
You
*NL*
will
tell
her
that
she
must
enter
her
complaint
against
carter
Pierre
*NL*
Chesnelong
.
The
man
is
a
brute
,
who
came
near
crushing
this
woman
and
*NL*
her
child
.
He
must
be
punished
.
You
will
then
go
to
M.
Charcellay
,
*NL*
Rue
Montre-de-Champigny
.
He
complained
that
there
is
a
gutter
on
the
*NL*
adjoining
house
which
discharges
rain-water
on
his
premises
,
and
is
*NL*
undermining
the
foundations
of
his
house
.
After
that
,
you
will
verify
*NL*
the
infractions
of
police
regulations
which
have
been
reported
to
me
in
*NL*
the
Rue
Guibourg
,
at
Widow
Doris
's

Rue
du
Garraud-Blanc
,
at
Madame
*NL*
Renee
le
Bosse
's
,
and
you
will
prepare
documents
.
But
I
am
giving
you
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
work
.
Are
you
not
to
be
absent
?
Did
you
not
tell
me
that
*NL*
you
were
going
to
Arras
on
that
matter
in
a
week

ten
days

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sooner

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
On

day

then

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I
thought
that
I
had
said

Monsieur

that
I
am

set
out
by

to-night

*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
made
an
imperceptible
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
will
the
case
last

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day

at
the
most

judgment
will
be
pronounced
to-morrow

But
I
shall
not
wait
for
the
sentence

is
certain

shall
return
here
as
soon
as
my
deposition

been
taken

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well

said
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
dismissed
Javert
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
did
not
withdraw
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me

Mr.

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is

demanded
M.
Madeleine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

*NL*
``
Javert

you

this

an
offence
which
concerns

Javert

promotion
instead
of
degradation

I
wish
you
to
retain
your

post

''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
gazed
at
M.
Madeleine
with
his
candid
eyes
,
in
whose
depths
his
*NL*
not
very
enlightened
but
pure
and
rigid
conscience
seemed
visible
,
and
*NL*
said
in
a
tranquil
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
I
can
not
grant
you
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
,
''
replied
M.
Madeleine
,
``
that
the
matter
concerns
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Javert
,
heeding
his
own
thought
only
,
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
exaggeration
is
concerned
,
I
am
not
exaggerating
.
This
is
the
*NL*
way
I
reason
:
I
have
suspected
you
unjustly
.
That
is
nothing
.
It
is
our
*NL*
right
to
cherish
suspicion
,
although
suspicion
directed
above
ourselves
*NL*
is
an
abuse
.
But
without
proofs
,
in
a
fit
of
rage
,
with
the
object
*NL*
of
wreaking
my
vengeance
,
I
have
denounced
you
as
a
convict
,
you
,
a
*NL*
respectable
man
,
a
mayor
,
a
magistrate
!
That
is
serious
,
very
serious
.
I
*NL*
have
insulted
authority
in
your
person
,
I
,
an
agent
of
the
authorities
!
*NL*
If
one
of
my
subordinates
had
done
what
I
have
done
,
I
should
have
*NL*
declared
him
unworthy
of
the
service
,
and
have
expelled
him
.
Well
?
Stop
,
*NL*
Mr.
Mayor
;
one
word
more
.
I
have
often
been
severe
in
the
course
of
my
*NL*
life
towards
others
.
That
is
just
.
I
have
done
well
.
Now
,
if
I
were
not
*NL*
severe
towards
myself
,
all
the
justice
that
I
have
done
would
become
*NL*
injustice
.
Ought
I
to
spare
myself
more
than
others
?
No
!
What
!
I
should
*NL*
be
good
for
nothing
but
to
chastise
others
,
and
not
myself
!
Why
,
I
*NL*
should
be
a
blackguard
!
Those
who
say
,
`
That
blackguard
of
a
Javert
!
'
*NL*
would
be
in
the
right
.
Mr.
Mayor
,
I
do
not
desire
that
you
should
treat
*NL*
me
kindly
;
your
kindness
roused
sufficient
bad
blood
in
me
when
it
was
*NL*
directed
to
others
.
I
want
none
of
it
for
myself
.
The
kindness
which
*NL*
consists
in
upholding
a
woman
of
the
town
against
a
citizen
,
the
police
*NL*
agent
against
the
mayor
,
the
man
who
is
down
against
the
man
who
is
*NL*
up
in
the
world
,
is
what
I
call
false
kindness
.
That
is
the
sort
of
*NL*
kindness
which
disorganizes
society
.
Good
God
!
it
is
very
easy
to
be
*NL*
kind
;
the
difficulty
lies
in
being
just
.
Come
!
if
you
had
been
what
I
*NL*
thought
you
,
I
should
not
have
been
kind
to
you
,
not
I
!
You
would
have
*NL*
seen
!
Mr.
Mayor
,
I
must
treat
myself
as
I
would
treat
any
other
man
.
*NL*
When
I
have
subdued
malefactors
,
when
I
have
proceeded
with
vigor
*NL*
against
rascals
,
I
have
often
said
to
myself
,
`
If
you
flinch
,
if
I
ever
*NL*
catch
you
in
fault
,
you
may
rest
at
your
ease
!
'
I
have
flinched
,
I
*NL*
have
caught
myself
in
a
fault
.
So
much
the
worse
!
Come
,
discharged
,
*NL*
cashiered
,
expelled
!
That
is
well
.
I
have
arms
.
I
will
till
the
soil
;
it
*NL*
makes
no
difference
to
me
.
Mr.
Mayor
,
the
good
of
the
service
demands
an
*NL*
example
.
I
simply
require
the
discharge
of
Inspector
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
uttered
in
a
proud
,
humble
,
despairing
,
yet
convinced
tone
,
*NL*
which
lent
indescribable
grandeur
to
this
singular
,
honest
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see
,
''
said
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
offered
him
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
recoiled
,
and
said
in
a
wild
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
but
this
must
not
be
.
A
mayor
does
not
offer
his
*NL*
hand
to
a
police
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
between
his
teeth
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
police
spy
,
yes
;
from
the
moment
when
I
have
misused
the
police
.
I
am
*NL*
no
more
than
a
police
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
bowed
profoundly
,
and
directed
his
steps
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
wheeled
round
,
and
with
eyes
still
downcast
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
shall
continue
to
serve
until
I
am
superseded
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
withdrew
.
M.
Madeleine
remained
thoughtfully
listening
to
the
firm
,
*NL*
sure
step
,
which
died
away
on
the
pavement
of
the
corridor

THE
CHAMPMATHIEU
AFFAIR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
--
SISTER
SIMPLICE
*NL*
*NL*
The
incidents
the
reader
is
about
to
peruse
were
not
all
known
at
M.
sur
*NL*
M
.
But
the
small
portion
of
them
which
became
known
left
such
a
memory
*NL*
in
that
town
that
a
serious
gap
would
exist
in
this
book
if
we
did
*NL*
not
narrate
them
in
their
most
minute
details
.
Among
these
details
the
*NL*
reader
will
encounter
two
or
three
improbable
circumstances
,
which
we
*NL*
preserve
out
of
respect
for
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
afternoon
following
the
visit
of
Javert
,
M.
Madeleine
went
to
see
*NL*
Fantine
according
to
his
wont
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
entering
Fantine
's
room
,
he
had
Sister
Simplice
summoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
nuns
who
performed
the
services
of
nurse
in
the
infirmary
,
*NL*
Lazariste
ladies
,
like
all
sisters
of
charity
,
bore
the
names
of
Sister
*NL*
Perpetue
and
Sister
Simplice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Perpetue
was
an
ordinary
villager
,
a
sister
of
charity
in
a
*NL*
coarse
style
,
who
had
entered
the
service
of
God
as
one
enters
any
other
*NL*
service
.
She
was
a
nun
as
other
women
are
cooks
.
This
type
is
not
*NL*
so
very
rare
.
The
monastic
orders
gladly
accept
this
heavy
peasant
*NL*
earthenware
,
which
is
easily
fashioned
into
a
Capuchin
or
an
Ursuline
.
*NL*
These
rustics
are
utilized
for
the
rough
work
of
devotion
.
The
*NL*
transition
from
a
drover
to
a
Carmelite
is
not
in
the
least
violent
;
*NL*
the
one
turns
into
the
other
without
much
effort
;
the
fund
of
ignorance
*NL*
common
to
the
village
and
the
cloister
is
a
preparation
ready
at
hand
,
*NL*
and
places
the
boor
at
once
on
the
same
footing
as
the
monk
:
a
little
*NL*
more
amplitude
in
the
smock
,
and
it
becomes
a
frock
.
Sister
Perpetue
*NL*
was
a
robust
nun
from
Marines
near
Pontoise
,
who
chattered
her
patois
,
*NL*
droned
,
grumbled
,
sugared
the
potion
according
to
the
bigotry
or
the
*NL*
hypocrisy
of
the
invalid
,
treated
her
patients
abruptly
,
roughly
,
was
*NL*
crabbed
with
the
dying
,
almost
flung
God
in
their
faces
,
stoned
their
*NL*
death
agony
with
prayers
mumbled
in
a
rage
;
was
bold
,
honest
,
and
ruddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Simplice
was
white
,
with
a
waxen
pallor
.
Beside
Sister
Perpetue
,
*NL*
she
was
the
taper
beside
the
candle
.
Vincent
de
Paul
has
divinely
traced
*NL*
the
features
of
the
Sister
of
Charity
in
these
admirable
words
,
in
which
*NL*
he
mingles
as
much
freedom
as
servitude
:
``
They
shall
have
for
their
*NL*
convent
only
the
house
of
the
sick
;
for
cell
only
a
hired
room
;
for
*NL*
chapel
only
their
parish
church
;
for
cloister
only
the
streets
of
the
*NL*
town
and
the
wards
of
the
hospitals
;
for
enclosure
only
obedience
;
for
*NL*
gratings
only
the
fear
of
God
;
for
veil
only
modesty
.
''
This
ideal
was
*NL*
realized
in
the
living
person
of
Sister
Simplice
:
she
had
never
been
*NL*
young
,
and
it
seemed
as
though
she
would
never
grow
old
.
No
one
could
*NL*
have
told
Sister
Simplice
's
age
.
She
was
a
person
--
we
dare
not
say
a
*NL*
woman
--
who
was
gentle
,
austere
,
well-bred
,
cold
,
and
who
had
never
lied
.
*NL*
She
was
so
gentle
that
she
appeared
fragile
;
but
she
was
more
solid
than
*NL*
granite
.
She
touched
the
unhappy
with
fingers
that
were
charmingly
pure
*NL*
and
fine
.
There
was
,
so
to
speak
,
silence
in
her
speech
;
she
said
just
*NL*
what
was
necessary
,
and
she
possessed
a
tone
of
voice
which
would
*NL*
have
equally
edified
a
confessional
or
enchanted
a
drawing-room
.
This
*NL*
delicacy
accommodated
itself
to
the
serge
gown
,
finding
in
this
harsh
*NL*
contact
a
continual
reminder
of
heaven
and
of
God
.
Let
us
emphasize
*NL*
one
detail
.
Never
to
have
lied
,
never
to
have
said
,
for
any
interest
*NL*
whatever
,
even
in
indifference
,
any
single
thing
which
was
not
the
*NL*
truth
,
the
sacred
truth
,
was
Sister
Simplice
's
distinctive
trait
;
it
was
*NL*
the
accent
of
her
virtue
.
She
was
almost
renowned
in
the
congregation
*NL*
for
this
imperturbable
veracity
.
The
Abbe
Sicard
speaks
of
Sister
*NL*
Simplice
in
a
letter
to
the
deaf-mute
Massieu
.
However
pure
and
sincere
*NL*
we
may
be
,
we
all
bear
upon
our
candor
the
crack
of
the
little
,
innocent
*NL*
lie
.
She
did
not
.
Little
lie
,
innocent
lie
--
does
such
a
thing
exist
?
To
*NL*
lie
is
the
absolute
form
of
evil
.
To
lie
a
little
is
not
possible
:
he
*NL*
who
lies
,
lies
the
whole
lie
.
To
lie
is
the
very
face
of
the
demon
.
*NL*
Satan
has
two
names
;
he
is
called
Satan
and
Lying
.
That
is
what
she
*NL*
thought
;
and
as
she
thought
,
so
she
did
.
The
result
was
the
whiteness
*NL*
which
we
have
mentioned
--
a
whiteness
which
covered
even
her
lips
and
her
*NL*
eyes
with
radiance
.
Her
smile
was
white
,
her
glance
was
white
.
There
was
*NL*
not
a
single
spider
's
web
,
not
a
grain
of
dust
,
on
the
glass
window
of
*NL*
that
conscience
.
On
entering
the
order
of
Saint
Vincent
de
Paul
,
she
had
*NL*
taken
the
name
of
Simplice
by
special
choice
.
Simplice
of
Sicily
,
as
we
*NL*
know
,
is
the
saint
who
preferred
to
allow
both
her
breasts
to
be
torn
*NL*
off
rather
than
to
say
that
she
had
been
born
at
Segesta
when
she
had
*NL*
been
born
at
Syracuse
--
a
lie
which
would
have
saved
her
.
This
patron
*NL*
saint
suited
this
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Simplice
,
on
her
entrance
into
the
order
,
had
had
two
faults
*NL*
which
she
had
gradually
corrected
:
she
had
a
taste
for
dainties
,
and
she
*NL*
liked
to
receive
letters
.
She
never
read
anything
but
a
book
of
prayers
*NL*
printed
in
Latin
,
in
coarse
type
.
She
did
not
understand
Latin
,
but
she
*NL*
understood
the
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pious
woman
had
conceived
an
affection
for
Fantine
,
probably
*NL*
feeling
a
latent
virtue
there
,
and
she
had
devoted
herself
almost
*NL*
exclusively
to
her
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
took
Sister
Simplice
apart
and
recommended
Fantine
to
her
*NL*
in
a
singular
tone
,
which
the
sister
recalled
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
sister
,
he
approached
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
awaited
M.
Madeleine
's
appearance
every
day
as
one
awaits
a
ray
*NL*
of
warmth
and
joy
.
She
said
to
the
sisters
,
``
I
only
live
when
Monsieur
*NL*
le
Maire
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
great
deal
of
fever
that
day
.
As
soon
as
she
saw
M.
Madeleine
*NL*
she
asked
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Cosette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
with
a
smile
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
was
the
same
as
usual
with
Fantine
.
Only
he
remained
an
*NL*
hour
instead
of
half
an
hour
,
to
Fantine
's
great
delight
.
He
urged
every
*NL*
one
repeatedly
not
to
allow
the
invalid
to
want
for
anything
.
It
was
*NL*
noticed
that
there
was
a
moment
when
his
countenance
became
very
sombre
.
*NL*
But
this
was
explained
when
it
became
known
that
the
doctor
had
bent
*NL*
down
to
his
ear
and
said
to
him
,
``
She
is
losing
ground
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
returned
to
the
town-hall
,
and
the
clerk
observed
him
*NL*
attentively
examining
a
road
map
of
France
which
hung
in
his
study
.
He
*NL*
wrote
a
few
figures
on
a
bit
of
paper
with
a
pencil
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
PERSPICACITY
OF
MASTER
SCAUFFLAIRE
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
town-hall
he
betook
himself
to
the
extremity
of
the
town
,
to
a
*NL*
Fleming
named
Master
Scaufflaer
,
French
Scaufflaire
,
who
let
out
``
horses
*NL*
and
cabriolets
as
desired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
reach
this
Scaufflaire
,
the
shortest
way
was
to
take
the
*NL*
little-frequented
street
in
which
was
situated
the
parsonage
of
the
*NL*
parish
in
which
M.
Madeleine
resided
.
The
cure
was
,
it
was
said
,
a
*NL*
worthy
,
respectable
,
and
sensible
man
.
At
the
moment
when
M.
Madeleine
*NL*
arrived
in
front
of
the
parsonage
there
was
but
one
passer-by
in
the
*NL*
street
,
and
this
person
noticed
this
:
After
the
mayor
had
passed
the
*NL*
priest
's
house
he
halted
,
stood
motionless
,
then
turned
about
,
and
*NL*
retraced
his
steps
to
the
door
of
the
parsonage
,
which
had
an
iron
*NL*
knocker
.
He
laid
his
hand
quickly
on
the
knocker
and
lifted
it
;
then
*NL*
he
paused
again
and
stopped
short
,
as
though
in
thought
,
and
after
*NL*
the
lapse
of
a
few
seconds
,
instead
of
allowing
the
knocker
to
fall
*NL*
abruptly
,
he
placed
it
gently
,
and
resumed
his
way
with
a
sort
of
haste
*NL*
which
had
not
been
apparent
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
found
Master
Scaufflaire
at
home
,
engaged
in
stitching
a
*NL*
harness
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Master
Scaufflaire
,
''
he
inquired
,
``
have
you
a
good
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
''
said
the
Fleming
,
``
all
my
horses
are
good
.
What
do
you
mean
*NL*
by
a
good
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
a
horse
which
can
travel
twenty
leagues
in
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
''
said
the
Fleming
.
``
Twenty
leagues
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hitched
to
a
cabriolet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
long
can
he
rest
at
the
end
of
his
journey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
must
be
able
to
set
out
again
on
the
next
day
if
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
traverse
the
same
road
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
the
deuce
!
And
it
is
twenty
leagues
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
drew
from
his
pocket
the
paper
on
which
he
had
pencilled
*NL*
some
figures
.
He
showed
it
to
the
Fleming
.
The
figures
were
5
,
6
,
8 1/2
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
``
total
,
nineteen
and
a
half
;
as
well
say
twenty
*NL*
leagues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Mayor
,
''
returned
the
Fleming
,
``
I
have
just
what
you
want
.
My
little
*NL*
white
horse
--
you
may
have
seen
him
pass
occasionally
;
he
is
a
small
*NL*
beast
from
Lower
Boulonnais
.
He
is
full
of
fire
.
They
wanted
to
make
*NL*
a
saddle-horse
of
him
at
first
.
Bah
!
He
reared
,
he
kicked
,
he
laid
*NL*
everybody
flat
on
the
ground
.
He
was
thought
to
be
vicious
,
and
no
one
*NL*
knew
what
to
do
with
him
.
I
bought
him
.
I
harnessed
him
to
a
carriage

*NL*
That
is
what
he
wanted
,
sir
;
he
is
as
gentle
as
a
girl
;
he
goes
like
the
*NL*
wind

Ah
!
indeed
he
must
not
be
mounted

It
does
not
suit
his
ideas
to
*NL*
be
a
saddle-horse
.
Every
one
has
his
ambition

`
Draw
?
Yes

Carry
?
No

*NL*
We
must
suppose
that
is
what
he
said
to
himself

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
will
accomplish
the
trip

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
twenty
leagues
all
at
a
full
trot

in

eight

*NL*
*NL*
``
State
them

In

him
half
an

midway

will
eat

some

must
be
by

eating
to
prevent
the
stable
boy
of
the
inn
from
stealing
his
oats

for

I
have
noticed
that

more
often

Some

M.

drew
three
napoleons
from

laid

on
the

table

M.

did
not

The
Fleming
resumed
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
is
very
cold

M.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

replied
Scaufflaire
;
then
,
scratching
a
*NL*
speck
in
the
wood
of
the
table
with
his
thumb-nail

he
resumed
with
that

careless
air
which
the
Flemings
understand
so
well
how
to
mingle
with
*NL*
their
shrewdness
:

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
thinking
of
nothing
else

the
beginning

conversation

but
he
did
not
know
why
he
had
not
dared
to
put
the
*NL*
question

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
M.

*NL*
*NL*
``

M.
Madeleine
;
and
he
took
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Fleming
remained
``
utterly
stupid

''
as
he
himself
said
some
time
*NL*
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mayor
had
been
gone
two
or
three
minutes
when
the
door
opened
again
;
*NL*
it
was
the
mayor
once
more

*NL*
*NL*
He
still
wore
the
same
impassive
and
preoccupied
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Scaufflaire

said
he
,
``

*NL*
M.
Madeleine
laid
a
bank-bill
on
the
table
,
then
left
the
room
;
and
this
*NL*
time
he
did
not
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Scaufflaire
experienced
a
frightful
regret
that
he
had
not
said
a
*NL*
thousand
francs
.
Besides
the
horse
and
tilbury
together
were
worth
but
a
*NL*
hundred
crowns
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Fleming
called
his
wife
,
and
related
the
affair
to
her
.
``
Where
the
*NL*
devil
could
Monsieur
le
Maire
be
going
?
''
They
held
counsel
together
.
*NL*
``
He
is
going
to
Paris
,

said
the
wife
.
``
I
do
n't
believe
it

said
the
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
had
forgotten
the
paper
with
the
figures
on
it
,
and
it
lay
*NL*
on
the
chimney-piece
.
The
Fleming
picked
it
up
and
studied
it
.
``
Five
,
*NL*
six
,
eight
and
a
half

That
must
designate
the
posting
relays

''
He
*NL*
turned
to
his
wife
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
found
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

six

*NL*
eight
and

half
from
Saint-Pol
to
Arras
.
He
is
going
to
Arras
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
M.
Madeleine
had
returned
home
.
He
had
taken
the
longest
way
*NL*
to
return
from
Master
Scaufflaire
's
,
as
though
the
parsonage
door
had
*NL*
been
a
temptation
for
him
,
and
he
had
wished
to
avoid
it
.
He
ascended
*NL*
to
his
room
,
and
there
he
shut
himself
up
,
which
was
a
very
simple
act
,
*NL*
since
he
liked
to
go
to
bed
early
.
Nevertheless
,
the
portress
of
the
*NL*
factory
,
who
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
M.
Madeleine
's
only
servant
,
noticed
*NL*
that
the
latter
's
light
was
extinguished
at
half-past
eight
,
and
she
*NL*
mentioned
it
to
the
cashier
when
he
came
home
,
adding
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Monsieur
le
Maire
ill
?
I
thought
he
had
a
rather
singular
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
cashier
occupied
a
room
situated
directly
under
M.
Madeleine
's
*NL*
chamber
.
He
paid
no
heed
to
the
portress
's
words
,
but
went
to
bed
and
*NL*
to
sleep
.
Towards
midnight
he
woke
up
with
a
start
;
in
his
sleep
he
had
*NL*
heard
a
noise
above
his
head
.
He
listened
;
it
was
a
footstep
pacing
back
*NL*
and
forth
,
as
though
some
one
were
walking
in
the
room
above
him
.
He
*NL*
listened
more
attentively
,
and
recognized
M.
Madeleine
's
step
.
This
*NL*
struck
him
as
strange
;
usually
,
there
was
no
noise
in
M.
Madeleine
's
*NL*
chamber
until
he
rose
in
the
morning
.
A
moment
later
the
cashier
heard
*NL*
a
noise
which
resembled
that
of
a
cupboard
being
opened
,
and
then
shut
*NL*
again
;
then
a
piece
of
furniture
was
disarranged
;
then
a
pause
ensued
;
*NL*
then
the
step
began
again
.
The
cashier
sat
up
in
bed
,
quite
awake
now
,
*NL*
and
staring
;
and
through
his
window-panes
he
saw
the
reddish
gleam
of
a
*NL*
lighted
window
reflected
on
the
opposite
wall
;
from
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
rays
,
it
could
only
come
from
the
window
of
M.
Madeleine
's
chamber
.
The
*NL*
reflection
wavered
,
as
though
it
came
rather
from
a
fire
which
had
*NL*
been
lighted
than
from
a
candle
.
The
shadow
of
the
window-frame
was
not
*NL*
shown
,
which
indicated
that
the
window
was
wide
open
.
The
fact
that
this
*NL*
window
was
open
in
such
cold
weather
was
surprising
.
The
cashier
fell
*NL*
asleep
again
.
An
hour
or
two
later
he
waked
again
.
The
same
step
was
*NL*
still
passing
slowly
and
regularly
back
and
forth
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reflection
was
still
visible
on
the
wall
,
but
now
it
was
pale
and
*NL*
peaceful
,
like
the
reflection
of
a
lamp
or
of
a
candle
.
The
window
was
*NL*
still
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
had
taken
place
in
M.
Madeleine
's
room
.

CHAPTER
III
--
A
TEMPEST
IN
A
SKULL
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
,
no
doubt
,
already
divined
that
M.
Madeleine
is
no
other
*NL*
than
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
gazed
into
the
depths
of
this
conscience
;
the
moment
has
*NL*
now
come
when
we
must
take
another
look
into
it
.
We
do
so
not
without
*NL*
emotion
and
trepidation
.
There
is
nothing
more
terrible
in
existence
*NL*
than
this
sort
of
contemplation
.
The
eye
of
the
spirit
can
nowhere
find
*NL*
more
dazzling
brilliance
and
more
shadow
than
in
man
;
it
can
fix
itself
*NL*
on
no
other
thing
which
is
more
formidable
,
more
complicated
,
more
*NL*
mysterious
,
and
more
infinite
.
There
is
a
spectacle
more
grand
than
the
*NL*
sea
;
it
is
heaven
:
there
is
a
spectacle
more
grand
than
heaven
;
it
is
*NL*
the
inmost
recesses
of
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
the
poem
of
the
human
conscience
,
were
it
only
with
reference
to
*NL*
a
single
man
,
were
it
only
in
connection
with
the
basest
of
men
,
would
*NL*
be
to
blend
all
epics
into
one
superior
and
definitive
epic
.
Conscience
*NL*
is
the
chaos
of
chimeras
,
of
lusts
,
and
of
temptations
;
the
furnace
of
*NL*
dreams
;
the
lair
of
ideas
of
which
we
are
ashamed
;
it
is
the
pandemonium
*NL*
of
sophisms
;
it
is
the
battlefield
of
the
passions
.
Penetrate
,
at
*NL*
certain
hours
,
past
the
livid
face
of
a
human
being
who
is
engaged
*NL*
in
reflection
,
and
look
behind
,
gaze
into
that
soul
,
gaze
into
that
*NL*
obscurity
.
There
,
beneath
that
external
silence
,
battles
of
giants
,
*NL*
like
those
recorded
in
Homer
,
are
in
progress
;
skirmishes
of
dragons
and
*NL*
hydras
and
swarms
of
phantoms
,
as
in
Milton
;
visionary
circles
,
as
in
*NL*
Dante
.
What
a
solemn
thing
is
this
infinity
which
every
man
bears
within
*NL*
him
,
and
which
he
measures
with
despair
against
the
caprices
of
his
*NL*
brain
and
the
actions
of
his
life
!
*NL*
*NL*
Alighieri
one
day
met
with
a
sinister-looking
door
,
before
which
he
*NL*
hesitated
.
Here
is
one
before
us
,
upon
whose
threshold
we
hesitate
.
Let
*NL*
us
enter
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
but
little
to
add
to
what
the
reader
already
knows
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
to
Jean
Valjean
after
the
adventure
with
Little
Gervais
.
From
*NL*
that
moment
forth
he
was
,
as
we
have
seen
,
a
totally
different
man
.
What
*NL*
the
Bishop
had
wished
to
make
of
him
,
that
he
carried
out
.
It
was
more
*NL*
than
a
transformation
;
it
was
a
transfiguration
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
succeeded
in
disappearing
,
sold
the
Bishop
's
silver
,
reserving
only
*NL*
the
candlesticks
as
a
souvenir
,
crept
from
town
to
town
,
traversed
*NL*
France
,
came
to
M.
sur
M.
,
conceived
the
idea
which
we
have
mentioned
,
*NL*
accomplished
what
we
have
related
,
succeeded
in
rendering
himself
safe
*NL*
from
seizure
and
inaccessible
,
and
,
thenceforth
,
established
at
M.
sur
*NL*
M.
,
happy
in
feeling
his
conscience
saddened
by
the
past
and
the
first
*NL*
half
of
his
existence
belied
by
the
last
,
he
lived
in
peace
,
reassured
*NL*
and
hopeful
,
having
henceforth
only
two
thoughts
,
--
to
conceal
his
name
*NL*
and
to
sanctify
his
life
;
to
escape
men
and
to
return
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
thoughts
were
so
closely
intertwined
in
his
mind
that
*NL*
they
formed
but
a
single
one
there
;
both
were
equally
absorbing
and
*NL*
imperative
and
ruled
his
slightest
actions
.
In
general
,
they
conspired
*NL*
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
his
life
;
they
turned
him
towards
the
gloom
;
*NL*
they
rendered
him
kindly
and
simple
;
they
counselled
him
to
the
same
*NL*
things
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
they
conflicted
.
In
that
case
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
will
remember
,
the
man
whom
all
the
country
of
M.
sur
M.
called
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
did
not
hesitate
to
sacrifice
the
first
to
the
second
--
his
*NL*
security
to
his
virtue
.
Thus
,
in
spite
of
all
his
reserve
and
all
his
*NL*
prudence
,
he
had
preserved
the
Bishop
's
candlesticks
,
worn
mourning
for
*NL*
him
,
summoned
and
interrogated
all
the
little
Savoyards
who
passed
that
*NL*
way
,
collected
information
regarding
the
families
at
Faverolles
,
and
*NL*
saved
old
Fauchelevent
's
life
,
despite
the
disquieting
insinuations
of
*NL*
Javert
.
It
seemed
,
as
we
have
already
remarked
,
as
though
he
thought
,
*NL*
following
the
example
of
all
those
who
have
been
wise
,
holy
,
and
just
,
*NL*
that
his
first
duty
was
not
towards
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
nothing
just
like
this
had
yet
*NL*
presented
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
the
two
ideas
which
governed
the
unhappy
man
whose
sufferings
*NL*
we
are
narrating
,
engaged
in
so
serious
a
struggle
.
He
understood
this
*NL*
confusedly
but
profoundly
at
the
very
first
words
pronounced
by
Javert
,
*NL*
when
the
latter
entered
his
study
.
At
the
moment
when
that
name
,
which
*NL*
he
had
buried
beneath
so
many
layers
,
was
so
strangely
articulated
,
*NL*
he
was
struck
with
stupor
,
and
as
though
intoxicated
with
the
sinister
*NL*
eccentricity
of
his
destiny
;
and
through
this
stupor
he
felt
that
*NL*
shudder
which
precedes
great
shocks
.
He
bent
like
an
oak
at
the
approach
*NL*
of
a
storm
,
like
a
soldier
at
the
approach
of
an
assault
.
He
felt
*NL*
shadows
filled
with
thunders
and
lightnings
descending
upon
his
head
.
*NL*
As
he
listened
to
Javert
,
the
first
thought
which
occurred
to
him
was
to
*NL*
go
,
to
run
and
denounce
himself
,
to
take
that
Champmathieu
out
of
prison
*NL*
and
place
himself
there
;
this
was
as
painful
and
as
poignant
as
an
*NL*
incision
in
the
living
flesh
.
Then
it
passed
away
,
and
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
We
will
see
!
We
will
see
!
''
He
repressed
this
first
,
generous
*NL*
instinct
,
and
recoiled
before
heroism
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
beautiful
,
no
doubt
,
after
the
Bishop
's
holy
words
,
after
*NL*
so
many
years
of
repentance
and
abnegation
,
in
the
midst
of
a
penitence
*NL*
admirably
begun
,
if
this
man
had
not
flinched
for
an
instant
,
even
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
so
terrible
a
conjecture
,
but
had
continued
to
walk
with
*NL*
the
same
step
towards
this
yawning
precipice
,
at
the
bottom
of
which
*NL*
lay
heaven
;
that
would
have
been
beautiful
;
but
it
was
not
thus
.
We
must
*NL*
render
an
account
of
the
things
which
went
on
in
this
soul
,
and
we
can
*NL*
only
tell
what
there
was
there
.
He
was
carried
away
,
at
first
,
by
*NL*
the
instinct
of
self-preservation
;
he
rallied
all
his
ideas
in
haste
,
*NL*
stifled
his
emotions
,
took
into
consideration
Javert
's
presence
,
that
*NL*
great
danger
,
postponed
all
decision
with
the
firmness
of
terror
,
shook
*NL*
off
thought
as
to
what
he
had
to
do
,
and
resumed
his
calmness
as
a
*NL*
warrior
picks
up
his
buckler
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
in
this
state
during
the
rest
of
the
day
,
a
whirlwind
*NL*
within
,
a
profound
tranquillity
without
.
He
took
no
``
preservative
*NL*
measures
,
''
as
they
may
be
called
.
Everything
was
still
confused
,
and
*NL*
jostling
together
in
his
brain
.
His
trouble
was
so
great
that
he
could
*NL*
not
perceive
the
form
of
a
single
idea
distinctly
,
and
he
could
have
*NL*
told
nothing
about
himself
,
except
that
he
had
received
a
great
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repaired
to
Fantine
's
bed
of
suffering
,
as
usual
,
and
prolonged
his
*NL*
visit
,
through
a
kindly
instinct
,
telling
himself
that
he
must
behave
*NL*
thus
,
and
recommend
her
well
to
the
sisters
,
in
case
he
should
be
*NL*
obliged
to
be
absent
himself
.
He
had
a
vague
feeling
that
he
might
be
*NL*
obliged
to
go
to
Arras
;
and
without
having
the
least
in
the
world
made
*NL*
up
his
mind
to
this
trip
,
he
said
to
himself
that
being
,
as
he
was
,
*NL*
beyond
the
shadow
of
any
suspicion
,
there
could
be
nothing
out
of
the
*NL*
way
in
being
a
witness
to
what
was
to
take
place
,
and
he
engaged
the
*NL*
tilbury
from
Scaufflaire
in
order
to
be
prepared
in
any
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dined
with
a
good
deal
of
appetite
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
returning
to
his
room
,
he
communed
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
examined
the
situation
,
and
found
it
unprecedented
;
so
unprecedented
*NL*
that
in
the
midst
of
his
revery
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
moved
by
some
*NL*
inexplicable
impulse
of
anxiety
,
and
bolted
his
door
.
He
feared
*NL*
lest
something
more
should
enter
.
He
was
barricading
himself
against
*NL*
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
he
extinguished
his
light
;
it
embarrassed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
might
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
whom
?
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
That
on
which
he
desired
to
close
the
door
had
already
entered
;
*NL*
that
which
he
desired
to
blind
was
staring
him
in
the
face
,
--
his
*NL*
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
conscience
;
that
is
to
say
,
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
deluded
himself
at
first
;
he
had
a
feeling
of
security
*NL*
and
of
solitude
;
the
bolt
once
drawn
,
he
thought
himself
impregnable
;
*NL*
the
candle
extinguished
,
he
felt
himself
invisible
.
Then
he
took
*NL*
possession
of
himself
:
he
set
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
leaned
his
head
*NL*
on
his
hand
,
and
began
to
meditate
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
I
stand
?
Am
not
I
dreaming
?
What
have
I
heard
?
Is
it
really
*NL*
true
that
I
have
seen
that
Javert
,
and
that
he
spoke
to
me
in
that
*NL*
manner
?
Who
can
that
Champmathieu
be
?
So
he
resembles
me
!
Is
it
*NL*
possible
?
When
I
reflect
that
yesterday
I
was
so
tranquil
,
and
so
far
*NL*
from
suspecting
anything
!
What
was
I
doing
yesterday
at
this
hour
?
What
*NL*
is
there
in
this
incident
?
What
will
the
end
be
?
What
is
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
torment
in
which
he
found
himself
.
His
brain
had
lost
its
*NL*
power
of
retaining
ideas
;
they
passed
like
waves
,
and
he
clutched
his
*NL*
brow
in
both
hands
to
arrest
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
but
anguish
extricated
itself
from
this
tumult
which
overwhelmed
*NL*
his
will
and
his
reason
,
and
from
which
he
sought
to
draw
proof
and
*NL*
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
was
burning
.
He
went
to
the
window
and
threw
it
wide
open
.
*NL*
There
were
no
stars
in
the
sky
.
He
returned
and
seated
himself
at
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
hour
passed
in
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gradually
,
however
,
vague
outlines
began
to
take
form
and
to
fix
*NL*
themselves
in
his
meditation
,
and
he
was
able
to
catch
a
glimpse
with
*NL*
precision
of
the
reality
,
--
not
the
whole
situation
,
but
some
of
*NL*
the
details
.
He
began
by
recognizing
the
fact
that
,
critical
and
*NL*
extraordinary
as
was
this
situation
,
he
was
completely
master
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
only
caused
an
increase
of
his
stupor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Independently
of
the
severe
and
religious
aim
which
he
had
assigned
to
*NL*
his
actions
,
all
that
he
had
made
up
to
that
day
had
been
nothing
but
a
*NL*
hole
in
which
to
bury
his
name
.
That
which
he
had
always
feared
most
of
*NL*
all
in
his
hours
of
self-communion
,
during
his
sleepless
nights
,
was
to
*NL*
ever
hear
that
name
pronounced
;
he
had
said
to
himself
,
that
that
would
*NL*
be
the
end
of
all
things
for
him
;
that
on
the
day
when
that
name
made
*NL*
its
reappearance
it
would
cause
his
new
life
to
vanish
from
about
*NL*
him
,
and
--
who
knows
?
--
perhaps
even
his
new
soul
within
him
,
also
.
He
*NL*
shuddered
at
the
very
thought
that
this
was
possible
.
Assuredly
,
if
any
*NL*
one
had
said
to
him
at
such
moments
that
the
hour
would
come
when
that
*NL*
name
would
ring
in
his
ears
,
when
the
hideous
words
,
Jean
Valjean
,
would
*NL*
suddenly
emerge
from
the
darkness
and
rise
in
front
of
him
,
when
that
*NL*
formidable
light
,
capable
of
dissipating
the
mystery
in
which
he
had
*NL*
enveloped
himself
,
would
suddenly
blaze
forth
above
his
head
,
and
that
*NL*
that
name
would
not
menace
him
,
that
that
light
would
but
produce
*NL*
an
obscurity
more
dense
,
that
this
rent
veil
would
but
increase
the
*NL*
mystery
,
that
this
earthquake
would
solidify
his
edifice
,
that
this
*NL*
prodigious
incident
would
have
no
other
result
,
so
far
as
he
was
*NL*
concerned
,
if
so
it
seemed
good
to
him
,
than
that
of
rendering
his
*NL*
existence
at
once
clearer
and
more
impenetrable
,
and
that
,
out
of
his
*NL*
confrontation
with
the
phantom
of
Jean
Valjean
,
the
good
and
worthy
*NL*
citizen
Monsieur
Madeleine
would
emerge
more
honored
,
more
peaceful
,
and
*NL*
more
respected
than
ever
--
if
any
one
had
told
him
that
,
he
would
have
*NL*
tossed
his
head
and
regarded
the
words
as
those
of
a
madman
.
Well
,
all
*NL*
this
was
precisely
what
had
just
come
to
pass
;
all
that
accumulation
of
*NL*
impossibilities
was
a
fact
,
and
God
had
permitted
these
wild
fancies
to
*NL*
become
real
things
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
revery
continued
to
grow
clearer
.
He
came
more
and
more
to
an
*NL*
understanding
of
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
but
just
waked
up
from
some
inexplicable
*NL*
dream
,
and
that
he
found
himself
slipping
down
a
declivity
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
night
,
erect
,
shivering
,
holding
back
all
in
vain
,
on
the
very
*NL*
brink
of
the
abyss
.
He
distinctly
perceived
in
the
darkness
a
stranger
,
*NL*
a
man
unknown
to
him
,
whom
destiny
had
mistaken
for
him
,
and
whom
she
*NL*
was
thrusting
into
the
gulf
in
his
stead
;
in
order
that
the
gulf
might
*NL*
close
once
more
,
it
was
necessary
that
some
one
,
himself
or
that
other
*NL*
man
,
should
fall
into
it
:
he
had
only
let
things
take
their
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
became
complete
,
and
he
acknowledged
this
to
himself
:
That
*NL*
his
place
was
empty
in
the
galleys
;
that
do
what
he
would
,
it
was
still
*NL*
awaiting
him
;
that
the
theft
from
little
Gervais
had
led
him
back
to
it
;
*NL*
that
this
vacant
place
would
await
him
,
and
draw
him
on
until
he
filled
*NL*
it
;
that
this
was
inevitable
and
fatal
;
and
then
he
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
that
,
at
this
moment
,
he
had
a
substitute
;
that
it
appeared
that
a
*NL*
certain
Champmathieu
had
that
ill
luck
,
and
that
,
as
regards
himself
,
*NL*
being
present
in
the
galleys
in
the
person
of
that
Champmathieu
,
present
*NL*
in
society
under
the
name
of
M.
Madeleine
,
he
had
nothing
more
to
fear
,
*NL*
provided
that
he
did
not
prevent
men
from
sealing
over
the
head
of
*NL*
that
Champmathieu
this
stone
of
infamy
which
,
like
the
stone
of
the
*NL*
sepulchre
,
falls
once
,
never
to
rise
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
so
strange
and
so
violent
,
that
there
suddenly
took
place
*NL*
in
him
that
indescribable
movement
,
which
no
man
feels
more
than
two
*NL*
or
three
times
in
the
course
of
his
life
,
a
sort
of
convulsion
of
the
*NL*
conscience
which
stirs
up
all
that
there
is
doubtful
in
the
heart
,
which
*NL*
is
composed
of
irony
,
of
joy
,
and
of
despair
,
and
which
may
be
called
an
*NL*
outburst
of
inward
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hastily
relighted
his
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
what
am
I
afraid
of
?
What
is
*NL*
there
in
all
that
for
me
to
think
about
?
I
am
safe
;
all
is
over
.
I
had
*NL*
but
one
partly
open
door
through
which
my
past
might
invade
my
life
,
*NL*
and
behold
that
door
is
walled
up
forever
!
That
Javert
,
who
has
been
*NL*
annoying
me
so
long
;
that
terrible
instinct
which
seemed
to
have
divined
*NL*
me
,
which
had
divined
me
--
good
God
!
and
which
followed
me
everywhere
;
*NL*
that
frightful
hunting-dog
,
always
making
a
point
at
me
,
is
thrown
*NL*
off
the
scent
,
engaged
elsewhere
,
absolutely
turned
from
the
trail
:
*NL*
henceforth
he
is
satisfied
;
he
will
leave
me
in
peace
;
he
has
his
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
Who
knows
?
it
is
even
probable
that
he
will
wish
to
leave
town
!
*NL*
And
all
this
has
been
brought
about
without
any
aid
from
me
,
and
I
count
*NL*
for
nothing
in
it
!
Ah
!
but
where
is
the
misfortune
in
this
?
Upon
my
*NL*
honor
,
people
would
think
,
to
see
me
,
that
some
catastrophe
had
happened
*NL*
to
me
!
After
all
,
if
it
does
bring
harm
to
some
one
,
that
is
not
my
*NL*
fault
in
the
least
:
it
is
Providence
which
has
done
it
all
;
it
is
*NL*
because
it
wishes
it
so
to
be
,
evidently
.
Have
I
the
right
to
disarrange
*NL*
what
it
has
arranged
?
What
do
I
ask
now
?
Why
should
I
meddle
?
It
does
*NL*
not
concern
me
;
what
!
I
am
not
satisfied
:
but
what
more
do
I
want
?
The
*NL*
goal
to
which
I
have
aspired
for
so
many
years
,
the
dream
of
my
nights
,
*NL*
the
object
of
my
prayers
to
Heaven
,
--
security
,
--
I
have
now
attained
;
it
*NL*
is
God
who
wills
it
;
I
can
do
nothing
against
the
will
of
God
,
and
why
*NL*
does
God
will
it
?
In
order
that
I
may
continue
what
I
have
begun
,
that
I
*NL*
may
do
good
,
that
I
may
one
day
be
a
grand
and
encouraging
example
,
that
*NL*
it
may
be
said
at
last
,
that
a
little
happiness
has
been
attached
to
*NL*
the
penance
which
I
have
undergone
,
and
to
that
virtue
to
which
I
have
*NL*
returned
.
Really
,
I
do
not
understand
why
I
was
afraid
,
a
little
while
*NL*
ago
,
to
enter
the
house
of
that
good
cure
,
and
to
ask
his
advice
;
this
*NL*
is
evidently
what
he
would
have
said
to
me
:
It
is
settled
;
let
things
*NL*
take
their
course
;
let
the
good
God
do
as
he
likes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
he
address
himself
in
the
depths
of
his
own
conscience
,
bending
*NL*
over
what
may
be
called
his
own
abyss
;
he
rose
from
his
chair
,
and
began
*NL*
to
pace
the
room
:
``
Come
,
''
said
he
,
``
let
us
think
no
more
about
it
;
my
*NL*
resolve
is
taken
!
''
but
he
felt
no
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
the
reverse
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
can
no
more
prevent
thought
from
recurring
to
an
idea
than
one
can
*NL*
the
sea
from
returning
to
the
shore
:
the
sailor
calls
it
the
tide
;
the
*NL*
guilty
man
calls
it
remorse
;
God
upheaves
the
soul
as
he
does
the
ocean
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
,
do
what
he
would
,
he
resumed
the
*NL*
gloomy
dialogue
in
which
it
was
he
who
spoke
and
he
who
listened
,
saying
*NL*
that
which
he
would
have
preferred
to
ignore
,
and
listened
to
that
which
*NL*
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
hear
,
yielding
to
that
mysterious
power
*NL*
which
said
to
him
:
``
Think
!
''
as
it
said
to
another
condemned
man
,
two
*NL*
thousand
years
ago
,
``
March
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
proceeding
further
,
and
in
order
to
make
ourselves
fully
*NL*
understood
,
let
us
insist
upon
one
necessary
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
people
do
talk
to
themselves
;
there
is
no
living
*NL*
being
who
has
not
done
it
.
It
may
even
be
said
that
the
word
is
never
*NL*
a
more
magnificent
mystery
than
when
it
goes
from
thought
to
conscience
*NL*
within
a
man
,
and
when
it
returns
from
conscience
to
thought
;
it
is
in
*NL*
this
sense
only
that
the
words
so
often
employed
in
this
chapter
,
he
*NL*
said
,
he
exclaimed
,
must
be
understood
;
one
speaks
to
one
's
self
,
talks
*NL*
to
one
's
self
,
exclaims
to
one
's
self
without
breaking
the
external
*NL*
silence
;
there
is
a
great
tumult
;
everything
about
us
talks
except
the
*NL*
mouth
.
The
realities
of
the
soul
are
none
the
less
realities
because
*NL*
they
are
not
visible
and
palpable
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
asked
himself
where
he
stood
.
He
interrogated
himself
upon
that
*NL*
``
settled
resolve
.
''
He
confessed
to
himself
that
all
that
he
had
just
*NL*
arranged
in
his
mind
was
monstrous
,
that
``
to
let
things
take
their
*NL*
course
,
to
let
the
good
God
do
as
he
liked
,
''
was
simply
horrible
;
to
*NL*
allow
this
error
of
fate
and
of
men
to
be
carried
out
,
not
to
hinder
it
,
*NL*
to
lend
himself
to
it
through
his
silence
,
to
do
nothing
,
in
short
,
*NL*
was
to
do
everything
!
that
this
was
hypocritical
baseness
in
the
last
*NL*
degree
!
that
it
was
a
base
,
cowardly
,
sneaking
,
abject
,
hideous
crime
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
eight
years
,
the
wretched
man
had
just
tasted
the
*NL*
bitter
savor
of
an
evil
thought
and
of
an
evil
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spit
it
out
with
disgust
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
question
himself
.
He
asked
himself
severely
what
he
had
*NL*
meant
by
this
,
``
My
object
is
attained
!
''
He
declared
to
himself
that
*NL*
his
life
really
had
an
object
;
but
what
object
?
To
conceal
his
name
?
*NL*
To
deceive
the
police
?
Was
it
for
so
petty
a
thing
that
he
had
done
all
*NL*
that
he
had
done
?
Had
he
not
another
and
a
grand
object
,
which
was
the
*NL*
true
one
--
to
save
,
not
his
person
,
but
his
soul
;
to
become
honest
and
*NL*
good
once
more
;
to
be
a
just
man
?
Was
it
not
that
above
all
,
that
alone
,
*NL*
which
he
had
always
desired
,
which
the
Bishop
had
enjoined
upon
him
--
to
*NL*
shut
the
door
on
his
past
?
But
he
was
not
shutting
it
!
great
God
!
he
was
*NL*
re-opening
it
by
committing
an
infamous
action
!
He
was
becoming
a
thief
*NL*
once
more
,
and
the
most
odious
of
thieves
!
He
was
robbing
another
of
*NL*
his
existence
,
his
life
,
his
peace
,
his
place
in
the
sunshine
.
He
was
*NL*
becoming
an
assassin
.
He
was
murdering
,
morally
murdering
,
a
wretched
*NL*
man
.
He
was
inflicting
on
him
that
frightful
living
death
,
that
death
*NL*
beneath
the
open
sky
,
which
is
called
the
galleys
.
On
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
to
surrender
himself
to
save
that
man
,
struck
down
with
so
melancholy
*NL*
an
error
,
to
resume
his
own
name
,
to
become
once
more
,
out
of
duty
,
the
*NL*
convict
Jean
Valjean
,
that
was
,
in
truth
,
to
achieve
his
resurrection
,
*NL*
and
to
close
forever
that
hell
whence
he
had
just
emerged
;
to
fall
back
*NL*
there
in
appearance
was
to
escape
from
it
in
reality
.
This
must
be
*NL*
done
!
He
had
done
nothing
if
he
did
not
do
all
this
;
his
whole
life
was
*NL*
useless
;
all
his
penitence
was
wasted
.
There
was
no
longer
any
need
of
*NL*
saying
,
``
What
is
the
use
?
''
He
felt
that
the
Bishop
was
there
,
that
the
*NL*
Bishop
was
present
all
the
more
because
he
was
dead
,
that
the
Bishop
*NL*
was
gazing
fixedly
at
him
,
that
henceforth
Mayor
Madeleine
,
with
all
his
*NL*
virtues
,
would
be
abominable
to
him
,
and
that
the
convict
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
would
be
pure
and
admirable
in
his
sight
;
that
men
beheld
his
mask
,
but
*NL*
that
the
Bishop
saw
his
face
;
that
men
saw
his
life
,
but
that
the
Bishop
*NL*
beheld
his
conscience
.
So
he
must
go
to
Arras
,
deliver
the
false
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
and
denounce
the
real
one
.
Alas
!
that
was
the
greatest
of
*NL*
sacrifices
,
the
most
poignant
of
victories
,
the
last
step
to
take
;
but
*NL*
it
must
be
done
.
Sad
fate
!
he
would
enter
into
sanctity
only
in
the
eyes
*NL*
of
God
when
he
returned
to
infamy
in
the
eyes
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
let
us
decide
upon
this
;
let
us
do
our
duty
;
let
us
*NL*
save
this
man
.
''
He
uttered
these
words
aloud
,
without
perceiving
that
he
*NL*
was
speaking
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
books
,
verified
them
,
and
put
them
in
order
.
He
flung
in
*NL*
the
fire
a
bundle
of
bills
which
he
had
against
petty
and
embarrassed
*NL*
tradesmen
.
He
wrote
and
sealed
a
letter
,
and
on
the
envelope
it
might
*NL*
have
been
read
,
had
there
been
any
one
in
his
chamber
at
the
moment
,
*NL*
To
Monsieur
Laffitte
,
Banker
,
Rue
d'Artois
,
Paris
.
He
drew
from
his
*NL*
secretary
a
pocket-book
which
contained
several
bank-notes
and
the
*NL*
passport
of
which
he
had
made
use
that
same
year
when
he
went
to
the
*NL*
elections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
had
seen
him
during
the
execution
of
these
various
acts
,
*NL*
into
which
there
entered
such
grave
thought
,
would
have
had
no
suspicion
*NL*
of
what
was
going
on
within
him
.
Only
occasionally
did
his
lips
move
;
at
*NL*
other
times
he
raised
his
head
and
fixed
his
gaze
upon
some
point
of
the
*NL*
wall
,
as
though
there
existed
at
that
point
something
which
he
wished
to
*NL*
elucidate
or
interrogate
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
the
letter
to
M.
Laffitte
,
he
put
it
into
his
*NL*
pocket
,
together
with
the
pocket-book
,
and
began
his
walk
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
revery
had
not
swerved
from
its
course
.
He
continued
to
see
his
duty
*NL*
clearly
,
written
in
luminous
letters
,
which
flamed
before
his
eyes
and
*NL*
changed
its
place
as
he
altered
the
direction
of
his
glance
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
!
Tell
your
name
!
Denounce
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
he
beheld
,
as
though
they
had
passed
before
him
in
*NL*
visible
forms
,
the
two
ideas
which
had
,
up
to
that
time
,
formed
*NL*
the
double
rule
of
his
soul
,
--
the
concealment
of
his
name
,
the
*NL*
sanctification
of
his
life
.
For
the
first
time
they
appeared
to
him
as
*NL*
absolutely
distinct
,
and
he
perceived
the
distance
which
separated
them
.
*NL*
He
recognized
the
fact
that
one
of
these
ideas
was
,
necessarily
,
good
,
*NL*
while
the
other
might
become
bad
;
that
the
first
was
self-devotion
,
and
*NL*
that
the
other
was
personality
;
that
the
one
said
,
my
neighbor
,
and
that
*NL*
the
other
said
,
myself
;
that
one
emanated
from
the
light
,
and
the
other
*NL*
from
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
antagonistic
.
He
saw
them
in
conflict
.
In
proportion
as
*NL*
he
meditated
,
they
grew
before
the
eyes
of
his
spirit
.
They
had
now
*NL*
attained
colossal
statures
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
beheld
within
*NL*
himself
,
in
that
infinity
of
which
we
were
recently
speaking
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
the
darkness
and
the
lights
,
a
goddess
and
a
giant
contending
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
filled
with
terror
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
good
thought
*NL*
was
getting
the
upper
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
the
second
decisive
crisis
of
his
*NL*
conscience
and
of
his
destiny
;
that
the
Bishop
had
marked
the
first
*NL*
phase
of
his
new
life
,
and
that
Champmathieu
marked
the
second
.
After
*NL*
the
grand
crisis
,
the
grand
test
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
fever
,
allayed
for
an
instant
,
gradually
resumed
possession
*NL*
of
him
.
A
thousand
thoughts
traversed
his
mind
,
but
they
continued
to
*NL*
fortify
him
in
his
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
moment
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
,
perhaps
,
taking
the
matter
*NL*
too
keenly
;
that
,
after
all
,
this
Champmathieu
was
not
interesting
,
and
*NL*
that
he
had
actually
been
guilty
of
theft
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
himself
:
``
If
this
man
has
,
indeed
,
stolen
a
few
apples
,
that
*NL*
means
a
month
in
prison
.
It
is
a
long
way
from
that
to
the
galleys
.
And
*NL*
who
knows
?
Did
he
steal
?
Has
it
been
proved
?
The
name
of
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
overwhelms
him
,
and
seems
to
dispense
with
proofs
.
Do
not
the
attorneys
*NL*
for
the
Crown
always
proceed
in
this
manner
?
He
is
supposed
to
be
a
*NL*
thief
because
he
is
known
to
be
a
convict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
instant
the
thought
had
occurred
to
him
that
,
when
he
*NL*
denounced
himself
,
the
heroism
of
his
deed
might
,
perhaps
,
be
taken
into
*NL*
consideration
,
and
his
honest
life
for
the
last
seven
years
,
and
what
he
*NL*
had
done
for
the
district
,
and
that
they
would
have
mercy
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
supposition
vanished
very
quickly
,
and
he
smiled
bitterly
as
he
*NL*
remembered
that
the
theft
of
the
forty
sous
from
little
Gervais
put
him
*NL*
in
the
position
of
a
man
guilty
of
a
second
offence
after
conviction
,
*NL*
that
this
affair
would
certainly
come
up
,
and
,
according
to
the
precise
*NL*
terms
of
the
law
,
would
render
him
liable
to
penal
servitude
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
aside
from
all
illusions
,
detached
himself
more
and
more
from
*NL*
earth
,
and
sought
strength
and
consolation
elsewhere
.
He
told
himself
*NL*
that
he
must
do
his
duty
;
that
perhaps
he
should
not
be
more
unhappy
*NL*
after
doing
his
duty
than
after
having
avoided
it
;
that
if
he
allowed
*NL*
things
to
take
their
own
course
,
if
he
remained
at
M.
sur
M.
,
his
*NL*
consideration
,
his
good
name
,
his
good
works
,
the
deference
and
*NL*
veneration
paid
to
him
,
his
charity
,
his
wealth
,
his
popularity
,
his
*NL*
virtue
,
would
be
seasoned
with
a
crime
.
And
what
would
be
the
taste
of
*NL*
all
these
holy
things
when
bound
up
with
this
hideous
thing
?
while
,
if
*NL*
he
accomplished
his
sacrifice
,
a
celestial
idea
would
be
mingled
with
*NL*
the
galleys
,
the
post
,
the
iron
necklet
,
the
green
cap
,
unceasing
toil
,
*NL*
and
pitiless
shame
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
he
told
himself
that
it
must
be
so
,
that
his
destiny
was
thus
*NL*
allotted
,
that
he
had
not
authority
to
alter
the
arrangements
made
on
*NL*
high
,
that
,
in
any
case
,
he
must
make
his
choice
:
virtue
without
and
*NL*
abomination
within
,
or
holiness
within
and
infamy
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stirring
up
of
these
lugubrious
ideas
did
not
cause
his
courage
to
*NL*
fail
,
but
his
brain
grow
weary
.
He
began
to
think
of
other
things
,
of
*NL*
indifferent
matters
,
in
spite
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
veins
in
his
temples
throbbed
violently
;
he
still
paced
to
and
fro
;
*NL*
midnight
sounded
first
from
the
parish
church
,
then
from
the
town-hall
;
*NL*
he
counted
the
twelve
strokes
of
the
two
clocks
,
and
compared
the
sounds
*NL*
of
the
two
bells
;
he
recalled
in
this
connection
the
fact
that
,
a
few
*NL*
days
previously
,
he
had
seen
in
an
ironmonger
's
shop
an
ancient
clock
*NL*
for
sale
,
upon
which
was
written
the
name
,
Antoine-Albin
de
Romainville
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
cold
;
he
lighted
a
small
fire
;
it
did
not
occur
to
him
to
close
*NL*
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
he
had
relapsed
into
his
stupor
;
he
was
obliged
to
make
*NL*
a
tolerably
vigorous
effort
to
recall
what
had
been
the
subject
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
before
midnight
had
struck
;
he
finally
succeeded
in
doing
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
I
had
resolved
to
inform
against
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
he
thought
of
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
said
he
,
``
and
what
about
that
poor
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
fresh
crisis
declared
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
,
by
appearing
thus
abruptly
in
his
revery
,
produced
the
effect
*NL*
of
an
unexpected
ray
of
light
;
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
everything
*NL*
about
him
were
undergoing
a
change
of
aspect
:
he
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
I
have
hitherto
considered
no
one
but
myself
;
it
is
proper
for
*NL*
me
to
hold
my
tongue
or
to
denounce
myself
,
to
conceal
my
person
or
*NL*
to
save
my
soul
,
to
be
a
despicable
and
respected
magistrate
,
or
an
*NL*
infamous
and
venerable
convict
;
it
is
I
,
it
is
always
I
and
nothing
*NL*
but
I
:
but
,
good
God
!
all
this
is
egotism
;
these
are
diverse
forms
*NL*
of
egotism
,
but
it
is
egotism
all
the
same
.
What
if
I
were
to
think
a
*NL*
little
about
others
?
The
highest
holiness
is
to
think
of
others
;
come
,
*NL*
let
us
examine
the
matter
.
The
_
I
_
excepted
,
the
_
I
_
effaced
,
the
_
I
_
*NL*
forgotten
,
what
would
be
the
result
of
all
this
?
What
if
I
denounce
*NL*
myself
?
I
am
arrested
;
this
Champmathieu
is
released
;
I
am
put
back
in
*NL*
the
galleys
;
that
is
well
--
and
what
then
?
What
is
going
on
here
?
Ah
!
*NL*
here
is
a
country
,
a
town
,
here
are
factories
,
an
industry
,
workers
,
*NL*
both
men
and
women
,
aged
grandsires
,
children
,
poor
people
!
All
this
I
*NL*
have
created
;
all
these
I
provide
with
their
living
;
everywhere
where
*NL*
there
is
a
smoking
chimney
,
it
is
I
who
have
placed
the
brand
on
the
*NL*
hearth
and
meat
in
the
pot
;
I
have
created
ease
,
circulation
,
credit
;
*NL*
before
me
there
was
nothing
;
I
have
elevated
,
vivified
,
informed
with
*NL*
life
,
fecundated
,
stimulated
,
enriched
the
whole
country-side
;
lacking
*NL*
me
,
the
soul
is
lacking
;
I
take
myself
off
,
everything
dies
:
and
this
*NL*
woman
,
who
has
suffered
so
much
,
who
possesses
so
many
merits
in
spite
*NL*
of
her
fall
;
the
cause
of
all
whose
misery
I
have
unwittingly
been
!
And
*NL*
that
child
whom
I
meant
to
go
in
search
of
,
whom
I
have
promised
to
her
*NL*
mother
;
do
I
not
also
owe
something
to
this
woman
,
in
reparation
for
*NL*
the
evil
which
I
have
done
her
?
If
I
disappear
,
what
happens
?
The
mother
*NL*
dies
;
the
child
becomes
what
it
can
;
that
is
what
will
take
place
,
if
*NL*
I
denounce
myself
.
If
I
do
not
denounce
myself
?
come
,
let
us
see
how
it
*NL*
will
be
if
I
do
not
denounce
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
putting
this
question
to
himself
,
he
paused
;
he
seemed
to
undergo
*NL*
a
momentary
hesitation
and
trepidation
;
but
it
did
not
last
long
,
and
he
*NL*
answered
himself
calmly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
man
is
going
to
the
galleys
;
it
is
true
,
but
what
the
deuce
!
*NL*
he
has
stolen
!
There
is
no
use
in
my
saying
that
he
has
not
been
guilty
*NL*
of
theft
,
for
he
has
!
I
remain
here
;
I
go
on
:
in
ten
years
I
shall
have
*NL*
made
ten
millions
;
I
scatter
them
over
the
country
;
I
have
nothing
of
*NL*
my
own
;
what
is
that
to
me
?
It
is
not
for
myself
that
I
am
doing
it
;
*NL*
the
prosperity
of
all
goes
on
augmenting
;
industries
are
aroused
and
*NL*
animated
;
factories
and
shops
are
multiplied
;
families
,
a
hundred
*NL*
families
,
a
thousand
families
,
are
happy
;
the
district
becomes
*NL*
populated
;
villages
spring
up
where
there
were
only
farms
before
;
*NL*
farms
rise
where
there
was
nothing
;
wretchedness
disappears
,
and
*NL*
with
wretchedness
debauchery
,
prostitution
,
theft
,
murder
;
all
vices
*NL*
disappear
,
all
crimes
:
and
this
poor
mother
rears
her
child
;
and
behold
*NL*
a
whole
country
rich
and
honest
!
Ah
!
I
was
a
fool
!
I
was
absurd
!
*NL*
what
was
that
I
was
saying
about
denouncing
myself
?
I
really
must
pay
*NL*
attention
and
not
be
precipitate
about
anything
.
What
!
because
it
would
*NL*
have
pleased
me
to
play
the
grand
and
generous
;
this
is
melodrama
,
after
*NL*
all
;
because
I
should
have
thought
of
no
one
but
myself
,
the
idea
!
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
saving
from
a
punishment
,
a
trifle
exaggerated
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
but
just
at
bottom
,
no
one
knows
whom
,
a
thief
,
a
good-for-nothing
,
*NL*
evidently
,
a
whole
country-side
must
perish
!
a
poor
woman
must
die
in
*NL*
the
hospital
!
a
poor
little
girl
must
die
in
the
street
!
like
dogs
;
ah
,
*NL*
this
is
abominable
!
And
without
the
mother
even
having
seen
her
child
*NL*
once
more
,
almost
without
the
child
's
having
known
her
mother
;
and
*NL*
all
that
for
the
sake
of
an
old
wretch
of
an
apple-thief
who
,
most
*NL*
assuredly
,
has
deserved
the
galleys
for
something
else
,
if
not
for
*NL*
that
;
fine
scruples
,
indeed
,
which
save
a
guilty
man
and
sacrifice
the
*NL*
innocent
,
which
save
an
old
vagabond
who
has
only
a
few
years
to
live
at
*NL*
most
,
and
who
will
not
be
more
unhappy
in
the
galleys
than
in
his
hovel
,
*NL*
and
which
sacrifice
a
whole
population
,
mothers
,
wives
,
children
.
This
*NL*
poor
little
Cosette
who
has
no
one
in
the
world
but
me
,
and
who
is
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
blue
with
cold
at
this
moment
in
the
den
of
those
Thenardiers
;
*NL*
those
peoples
are
rascals
;
and
I
was
going
to
neglect
my
duty
towards
*NL*
all
these
poor
creatures
;
and
I
was
going
off
to
denounce
myself
;
and
I
*NL*
was
about
to
commit
that
unspeakable
folly
!
Let
us
put
it
at
the
worst
:
*NL*
suppose
that
there
is
a
wrong
action
on
my
part
in
this
,
and
that
my
*NL*
conscience
will
reproach
me
for
it
some
day
,
to
accept
,
for
the
good
of
*NL*
others
,
these
reproaches
which
weigh
only
on
myself
;
this
evil
action
*NL*
which
compromises
my
soul
alone
;
in
that
lies
self-sacrifice
;
in
that
*NL*
alone
there
is
virtue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
and
resumed
his
march
;
this
time
,
he
seemed
to
be
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
Diamonds
are
found
only
in
the
dark
places
of
the
earth
;
truths
are
*NL*
found
only
in
the
depths
of
thought
.
It
seemed
to
him
,
that
,
after
*NL*
having
descended
into
these
depths
,
after
having
long
groped
among
the
*NL*
darkest
of
these
shadows
,
he
had
at
last
found
one
of
these
diamonds
,
*NL*
one
of
these
truths
,
and
that
he
now
held
it
in
his
hand
,
and
he
was
*NL*
dazzled
as
he
gazed
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
thought
,
``
this
is
right
;
I
am
on
the
right
road
;
I
have
the
*NL*
solution
;
I
must
end
by
holding
fast
to
something
;
my
resolve
is
taken
;
*NL*
let
things
take
their
course
;
let
us
no
longer
vacillate
;
let
us
no
*NL*
longer
hang
back
;
this
is
for
the
interest
of
all
,
not
for
my
own
;
I
am
*NL*
Madeleine
,
and
Madeleine
I
remain

Woe
to

is
Jean

*NL*
I
am
no

he

I
do
not

I
no

know
anything

it
*NL*
turns
out
that
some
one
is
Jean
Valjean
at
the
present
moment
;
let
him
*NL*
look
out
for
himself
;
that
does
not
concern
me
;
it
is
a
fatal
name
which
*NL*
was
floating
abroad
in
the
night
;
if
it
halts
and
descends
on
a
head
,
so
*NL*
much
the
worse
for
that
head

He
looked
into
the
little
mirror
which
hung
above
his
chimney-piece
,
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
it
has
relieved
me
to
come
to
a
decision
;
I
am
quite
another
man
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
proceeded
a
few
paces
further
,
then
he
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
''
he
said
,
``
I
must
not
flinch
before
any
of
the
consequences
of
*NL*
the
resolution
which
I
have
once
adopted
;
there
are
still
threads
which
*NL*
attach
me
to
that
Jean
Valjean
;
they
must
be
broken
;
in
this
very
room
*NL*
there
are
objects
which
would
betray
me
,
dumb
things
which
would
bear
*NL*
witness
against
me
;
it
is
settled
;
all
these
things
must
disappear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumbled
in
his
pocket
,
drew
out
his
purse
,
opened
it
,
and
took
out
a
*NL*
small
key
;
he
inserted
the
key
in
a
lock
whose
aperture
could
hardly
*NL*
be
seen
,
so
hidden
was
it
in
the
most
sombre
tones
of
the
design
which
*NL*
covered
the
wall-paper
;
a
secret
receptacle
opened
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
false
cupboard
constructed
in
the
angle
between
the
wall
and
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
;
in
this
hiding-place
there
were
some
rags
--
a
blue
linen
*NL*
blouse
,
an
old
pair
of
trousers
,
an
old
knapsack
,
and
a
huge
thorn
*NL*
cudgel
shod
with
iron
at
both
ends
.
Those
who
had
seen
Jean
Valjean
at
*NL*
the
epoch
when
he
passed
through
D
--
in
October
,
1815
,
could
easily
*NL*
have
recognized
all
the
pieces
of
this
miserable
outfit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
preserved
them
as
he
had
preserved
the
silver
candlesticks
,
in
*NL*
order
to
remind
himself
continually
of
his
starting-point
,
but
he
*NL*
had
concealed
all
that
came
from
the
galleys
,
and
he
had
allowed
the
*NL*
candlesticks
which
came
from
the
Bishop
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
a
furtive
glance
towards
the
door
,
as
though
he
feared
that
it
*NL*
would
open
in
spite
of
the
bolt
which
fastened
it
;
then
,
with
a
quick
*NL*
and
abrupt
movement
,
he
took
the
whole
in
his
arms
at
once
,
without
*NL*
bestowing
so
much
as
a
glance
on
the
things
which
he
had
so
religiously
*NL*
and
so
perilously
preserved
for
so
many
years
,
and
flung
them
all
,
rags
,
*NL*
cudgel
,
knapsack
,
into
the
fire
.

*NL*
*NL*
He
closed
the
false
cupboard
again
,
and
with
redoubled
precautions
,
*NL*
henceforth
unnecessary
,
since
it
was
now
empty
,
he
concealed
the
door
*NL*
behind
a
heavy
piece
of
furniture
,
which
he
pushed
in
front
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
seconds
,
the
room
and
the
opposite
wall
were
*NL*
lighted
up
with
a
fierce
,
red
,
tremulous
glow
.
Everything
was
on
fire
;
*NL*
the
thorn
cudgel
snapped
and
threw
out
sparks
to
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
knapsack
was
consumed
,
together
with
the
hideous
rags
which
it
*NL*
contained
,
it
revealed
something
which
sparkled
in
the
ashes
.
By
bending
*NL*
over
,
one
could
have
readily
recognized
a
coin
,
--
no
doubt
the
forty-sou
*NL*
piece
stolen
from
the
little
Savoyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
look
at
the
fire
,
but
paced
back
and
forth
with
the
same
*NL*
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
his
eye
fell
on
the
two
silver
candlesticks
,
which
shone
*NL*
vaguely
on
the
chimney-piece
,
through
the
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
he
thought
;
``
the
whole
of
Jean
Valjean
is
still
in
them
.
They
*NL*
must
be
destroyed
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
the
two
candlesticks
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
fire
enough
to
allow
of
their
being
put
out
of
shape
,
*NL*
and
converted
into
a
sort
of
unrecognizable
bar
of
metal
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
over
the
hearth
and
warmed
himself
for
a
moment
.
He
felt
a
sense
*NL*
of
real
comfort
.
``
How
good
warmth
is
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stirred
the
live
coals
with
one
of
the
candlesticks
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
minute
more
,
and
they
were
both
in
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
heard
a
voice
within
him
*NL*
shouting
:
``
Jean
Valjean
!
Jean
Valjean
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hair
rose
upright
:
he
became
like
a
man
who
is
listening
to
some
*NL*
terrible
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
!
finish
!
''
said
the
voice
.
``
Complete
what
you
are
about
!
*NL*
Destroy
these
candlesticks
!
Annihilate
this
souvenir
!
Forget
the
Bishop
!
*NL*
Forget
everything
!
Destroy
this
Champmathieu
,
do
!
That
is
right
!
Applaud
*NL*
yourself
!
So
it
is
settled
,
resolved
,
fixed
,
agreed
:
here
is
an
old
man
*NL*
who
does
not
know
what
is
wanted
of
him
,
who
has
,
perhaps
,
done
nothing
,
*NL*
an
innocent
man
,
whose
whole
misfortune
lies
in
your
name
,
upon
whom
*NL*
your
name
weighs
like
a
crime
,
who
is
about
to
be
taken
for
you
,
who
*NL*
will
be
condemned
,
who
will
finish
his
days
in
abjectness
and
horror
.
*NL*
That
is
good
!
Be
an
honest
man
yourself
;
remain
Monsieur
le
Maire
;
*NL*
remain
honorable
and
honored
;
enrich
the
town
;
nourish
the
indigent
;
*NL*
rear
the
orphan
;
live
happy
,
virtuous
,
and
admired
;
and
,
during
this
*NL*
time
,
while
you
are
here
in
the
midst
of
joy
and
light
,
there
will
be
a
*NL*
man
who
will
wear
your
red
blouse
,
who
will
bear
your
name
in
ignominy
,
*NL*
and
who
will
drag
your
chain
in
the
galleys
.
Yes
,
it
is
well
arranged
*NL*
thus
.
Ah
,
wretch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
perspiration
streamed
from
his
brow
.
He
fixed
a
haggard
eye
on
the
*NL*
candlesticks
.
But
that
within
him
which
had
spoken
had
not
finished
.
The
*NL*
voice
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jean
Valjean
,
there
will
be
around
you
many
voices
,
which
will
make
a
*NL*
great
noise
,
which
will
talk
very
loud
,
and
which
will
bless
you
,
and
*NL*
only
one
which
no
one
will
hear
,
and
which
will
curse
you
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
Well
!
listen
,
infamous
man
!
All
those
benedictions
will
fall
back
before
*NL*
they
reach
heaven
,
and
only
the
malediction
will
ascend
to
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
voice
,
feeble
at
first
,
and
which
had
proceeded
from
the
most
*NL*
obscure
depths
of
his
conscience
,
had
gradually
become
startling
and
*NL*
formidable
,
and
he
now
heard
it
in
his
very
ear
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
it
had
detached
itself
from
him
,
and
that
it
was
now
speaking
outside
*NL*
of
him
.
He
thought
that
he
heard
the
last
words
so
distinctly
,
that
he
*NL*
glanced
around
the
room
in
a
sort
of
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
one
here
?
''
he
demanded
aloud
,
in
utter
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
resumed
,
with
a
laugh
which
resembled
that
of
an
idiot
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupid
I
am
!
There
can
be
no
one
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
one
;
but
the
person
who
was
there
was
of
those
whom
the
*NL*
human
eye
can
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
the
candlesticks
on
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
resumed
his
monotonous
and
lugubrious
tramp
,
which
troubled
the
*NL*
dreams
of
the
sleeping
man
beneath
him
,
and
awoke
him
with
a
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
tramping
to
and
fro
soothed
and
at
the
same
time
intoxicated
him
.
*NL*
It
sometimes
seems
,
on
supreme
occasions
,
as
though
people
moved
about
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
asking
advice
of
everything
that
they
may
encounter
*NL*
by
change
of
place
.
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
he
no
longer
knew
*NL*
his
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
recoiled
in
equal
terror
before
both
the
resolutions
at
which
he
*NL*
had
arrived
in
turn
.
The
two
ideas
which
counselled
him
appeared
to
him
*NL*
equally
fatal
.
What
a
fatality
!
What
conjunction
that
that
Champmathieu
*NL*
should
have
been
taken
for
him
;
to
be
overwhelmed
by
precisely
the
means
*NL*
which
Providence
seemed
to
have
employed
,
at
first
,
to
strengthen
his
*NL*
position
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
moment
when
he
reflected
on
the
future
.
Denounce
himself
,
*NL*
great
God
!
Deliver
himself
up
!
With
immense
despair
he
faced
all
that
*NL*
he
should
be
obliged
to
leave
,
all
that
he
should
be
obliged
to
take
up
*NL*
once
more
.
He
should
have
to
bid
farewell
to
that
existence
which
was
so
*NL*
good
,
so
pure
,
so
radiant
,
to
the
respect
of
all
,
to
honor
,
to
liberty
.
*NL*
He
should
never
more
stroll
in
the
fields
;
he
should
never
more
hear
the
*NL*
birds
sing
in
the
month
of
May
;
he
should
never
more
bestow
alms
on
the
*NL*
little
children
;
he
should
never
more
experience
the
sweetness
of
having
*NL*
glances
of
gratitude
and
love
fixed
upon
him
;
he
should
quit
that
house
*NL*
which
he
had
built
,
that
little
chamber
!
Everything
seemed
charming
to
*NL*
him
at
that
moment
.
Never
again
should
he
read
those
books
;
never
more
*NL*
should
he
write
on
that
little
table
of
white
wood
;
his
old
portress
,
*NL*
the
only
servant
whom
he
kept
,
would
never
more
bring
him
his
coffee
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
Great
God
!
instead
of
that
,
the
convict
gang
,
the
iron
*NL*
necklet
,
the
red
waistcoat
,
the
chain
on
his
ankle
,
fatigue
,
the
cell
,
*NL*
the
camp
bed
all
those
horrors
which
he
knew
so
well
!
At
his
age
,
*NL*
after
having
been
what
he
was
!
If
he
were
only
young
again
!
but
to
*NL*
be
addressed
in
his
old
age
as
``
thou
''
by
any
one
who
pleased
;
to
*NL*
be
searched
by
the
convict-guard
;
to
receive
the
galley-sergeant
's
*NL*
cudgellings
;
to
wear
iron-bound
shoes
on
his
bare
feet
;
to
have
to
*NL*
stretch
out
his
leg
night
and
morning
to
the
hammer
of
the
roundsman
who
*NL*
visits
the
gang
;
to
submit
to
the
curiosity
of
strangers
,
who
would
be
*NL*
told
:
``
That
man
yonder
is
the
famous
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
mayor
of
*NL*
M.
sur
M.
''
;
and
at
night
,
dripping
with
perspiration
,
overwhelmed
with
*NL*
lassitude
,
their
green
caps
drawn
over
their
eyes
,
to
remount
,
two
by
*NL*
two
,
the
ladder
staircase
of
the
galleys
beneath
the
sergeant
's
whip
.
*NL*
Oh
,
what
misery
!
Can
destiny
,
then
,
be
as
malicious
as
an
intelligent
*NL*
being
,
and
become
as
monstrous
as
the
human
heart
?
*NL*
*NL*
And
do
what
he
would
,
he
always
fell
back
upon
the
heartrending
dilemma
*NL*
which
lay
at
the
foundation
of
his
revery
:
``
Should
he
remain
in
paradise
*NL*
and
become
a
demon
?
Should
he
return
to
hell
and
become
an
angel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
to
be
done
?
Great
God
!
what
was
to
be
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
torment
from
which
he
had
escaped
with
so
much
difficulty
was
*NL*
unchained
afresh
within
him
.
His
ideas
began
to
grow
confused
once
*NL*
more
;
they
assumed
a
kind
of
stupefied
and
mechanical
quality
which
is
*NL*
peculiar
to
despair
.
The
name
of
Romainville
recurred
incessantly
to
his
*NL*
mind
,
with
the
two
verses
of
a
song
which
he
had
heard
in
the
past
.
*NL*
He
thought
that
Romainville
was
a
little
grove
near
Paris
,
where
young
*NL*
lovers
go
to
pluck
lilacs
in
the
month
of
April
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wavered
outwardly
as
well
as
inwardly
.
He
walked
like
a
little
child
*NL*
who
is
permitted
to
toddle
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
intervals
,
as
he
combated
his
lassitude
,
he
made
an
effort
to
recover
*NL*
the
mastery
of
his
mind
.
He
tried
to
put
to
himself
,
for
the
last
time
,
*NL*
and
definitely
,
the
problem
over
which
he
had
,
in
a
manner
,
fallen
*NL*
prostrate
with
fatigue
:
Ought
he
to
denounce
himself
?
Ought
he
to
hold
*NL*
his
peace
?
He
could
not
manage
to
see
anything
distinctly
.
The
vague
*NL*
aspects
of
all
the
courses
of
reasoning
which
had
been
sketched
out
by
*NL*
his
meditations
quivered
and
vanished
,
one
after
the
other
,
into
smoke
.
*NL*
He
only
felt
that
,
to
whatever
course
of
action
he
made
up
his
mind
,
*NL*
something
in
him
must
die
,
and
that
of
necessity
,
and
without
his
being
*NL*
able
to
escape
the
fact
;
that
he
was
entering
a
sepulchre
on
the
*NL*
right
hand
as
much
as
on
the
left
;
that
he
was
passing
through
a
death
*NL*
agony
,
--
the
agony
of
his
happiness
,
or
the
agony
of
his
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
all
his
resolution
had
again
taken
possession
of
him
.
He
was
no
*NL*
further
advanced
than
at
the
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
did
this
unhappy
soul
struggle
in
its
anguish
.
Eighteen
hundred
*NL*
years
before
this
unfortunate
man
,
the
mysterious
Being
in
whom
are
*NL*
summed
up
all
the
sanctities
and
all
the
sufferings
of
humanity
had
also
*NL*
long
thrust
aside
with
his
hand
,
while
the
olive-trees
quivered
in
*NL*
the
wild
wind
of
the
infinite
,
the
terrible
cup
which
appeared
to
Him
*NL*
dripping
with
darkness
and
overflowing
with
shadows
in
the
depths
all
*NL*
studded
with
stars
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
FORMS
ASSUMED
BY
SUFFERING
DURING
SLEEP
*NL*
*NL*
Three
o'clock
in
the
morning
had
just
struck
,
and
he
had
been
walking
*NL*
thus
for
five
hours
,
almost
uninterruptedly
,
when
he
at
length
allowed
*NL*
himself
to
drop
into
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
fell
asleep
and
had
a
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dream
,
like
the
majority
of
dreams
,
bore
no
relation
to
the
*NL*
situation
,
except
by
its
painful
and
heart-rending
character
,
but
it
*NL*
made
an
impression
on
him
.
This
nightmare
struck
him
so
forcibly
that
he
*NL*
wrote
it
down
later
on
.
It
is
one
of
the
papers
in
his
own
handwriting
*NL*
which
he
has
bequeathed
to
us
.
We
think
that
we
have
here
reproduced
the
*NL*
thing
in
strict
accordance
with
the
text
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
whatever
nature
this
dream
may
be
,
the
history
of
this
night
would
*NL*
be
incomplete
if
we
were
to
omit
it
:
it
is
the
gloomy
adventure
of
an
*NL*
ailing
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
it
is
.
On
the
envelope
we
find
this
line
inscribed
,
``
The
Dream
I
*NL*
had
that
Night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
in
a
plain
;
a
vast
,
gloomy
plain
,
where
there
was
no
grass
.
It
*NL*
did
not
seem
to
me
to
be
daylight
nor
yet
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
walking
with
my
brother
,
the
brother
of
my
childish
years
,
*NL*
the
brother
of
whom
,
I
must
say
,
I
never
think
,
and
whom
I
now
hardly
*NL*
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
conversing
and
we
met
some
passers-by
.
We
were
talking
of
a
*NL*
neighbor
of
ours
in
former
days
,
who
had
always
worked
with
her
window
*NL*
open
from
the
time
when
she
came
to
live
on
the
street
.
As
we
talked
we
*NL*
felt
cold
because
of
that
open
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
no
trees
in
the
plain
.
We
saw
a
man
passing
close
to
us
.
He
*NL*
was
entirely
nude
,
of
the
hue
of
ashes
,
and
mounted
on
a
horse
which
was
*NL*
earth
color
.
The
man
had
no
hair
;
we
could
see
his
skull
and
the
veins
*NL*
on
it
.
In
his
hand
he
held
a
switch
which
was
as
supple
as
a
vine-shoot
*NL*
and
as
heavy
as
iron
.
This
horseman
passed
and
said
nothing
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
brother
said
to
me
,
`
Let
us
take
to
the
hollow
road
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
existed
a
hollow
way
wherein
one
saw
neither
a
single
shrub
nor
*NL*
a
spear
of
moss
.
Everything
was
dirt-colored
,
even
the
sky
.
After
*NL*
proceeding
a
few
paces
,
I
received
no
reply
when
I
spoke
:
I
perceived
*NL*
that
my
brother
was
no
longer
with
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entered
a
village
which
I
espied

I
reflected
that
it
must
be

Romainville

Romainville

The
first

I
entered
a

Behind
the
angle
formed
by
the
two
streets
,
a
man
was
standing
*NL*
erect
against
the
wall

I
said
to
this
Man
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
What
country
is
this

Where
am
I

The
man
made
no

I
saw
the
*NL*
door
of
a
house
open
,
and
I
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
first
chamber

Behind
the
door

of
this
chamber
a

standing
erect

I
inquired
of
*NL*
this

not

The

Behind
the

tree
I
found
a

standing

upright

to
this
man

The

did
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
strolled
into
the
village

and
perceived
that
it
was
a
town

All
*NL*
the
streets
were
deserted

all
the
doors
were
open

Not
a
single
living
*NL*
being
was
passing
in
the
streets
,
walking
through
the
chambers
or
*NL*
strolling
in
the
gardens
.
But
behind
each
angle
of
the
walls
,
behind
*NL*
each
door
,
behind
each
tree
,
stood
a
silent
man
.
Only
one
was
to
be
seen
*NL*
at
a
time
.
These
men
watched
me
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
left
the
town
and
began
to
ramble
about
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
the
lapse
of
some
time
I
turned
back
and
saw
a
great
crowd
coming
*NL*
up
behind
me
.
I
recognized
all
the
men
whom
I
had
seen
in
that
town
.
*NL*
They
had
strange
heads
.
They
did
not
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
,
yet
they
*NL*
walked
faster
than
I
did
.
They
made
no
noise
as
they
walked
.
In
an
*NL*
instant
this
crowd
had
overtaken
and
surrounded
me
.
The
faces
of
these
*NL*
men
were
earthen
in
hue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
the
first
one
whom
I
had
seen
and
questioned
on
entering
the
town
*NL*
said
to
me
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Whither
are
you
going

Do
you
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
opened
my
mouth
to
reply
,
and
I
perceived
that
there
was
no
one
near
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
woke
.
He
was
icy
cold
.
A
wind
which
was
chill
like
the
breeze
of
dawn
*NL*
was
rattling
the
leaves
of
the
window
,
which
had
been
left
open
on
their
*NL*
hinges
.
The
fire
was
out
.
The
candle
was
nearing
its
end
.
It
was
still
*NL*
black
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
he
went
to
the
window
.
There
were
no
stars
in
the
sky
even
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
window
the
yard
of
the
house
and
the
street
were
visible
.
A
*NL*
sharp
,
harsh
noise
,
which
made
him
drop
his
eyes
,
resounded
from
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
him
he
perceived
two
red
stars
,
whose
rays
lengthened
and
*NL*
shortened
in
a
singular
manner
through
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
thoughts
were
still
half
immersed
in
the
mists
of
sleep
,
``
Hold
!
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
there
are
no
stars
in
the
sky
.
They
are
on
earth
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
confusion
vanished
;
a
second
sound
similar
to
the
first
roused
*NL*
him
thoroughly
;
he
looked
and
recognized
the
fact
that
these
two
stars
*NL*
were
the
lanterns
of
a
carriage
.
By
the
light
which
they
cast
he
was
*NL*
able
to
distinguish
the
form
of
this
vehicle
.
It
was
a
tilbury
harnessed
*NL*
to
a
small
white
horse
.
The
noise
which
he
had
heard
was
the
trampling
*NL*
of
the
horse
's
hoofs
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
vehicle
is
this
?
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Who
is
coming
here
so
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
there
came
a
light
tap
on
the
door
of
his
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
from
head
to
foot
,
and
cried
in
a
terrible
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
Monsieur
le
Maire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
recognized
the
voice
of
the
old
woman
who
was
his
portress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
replied
,
``
what
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Maire
,
it
is
just
five
o'clock
in
the
morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
to
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The

here

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
cabriolet

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tilbury

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
tilbury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
not
Monsieur
le
Maire
order
a
tilbury

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coachman
says
that
he
has
come
for
Monsieur

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
coachman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Scaufflaire
's
coachman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Scaufflaire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
name
sent
a
shudder
over
him
,
as
though
a
flash
of
lightning
had
*NL*
passed
in
front
of
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
,
''
he
resumed
;
``
M.
Scaufflaire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
old
woman
could
have
seen
him
at
that
moment
,
she
would
have
been
*NL*
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tolerably
long
silence
ensued
.
He
examined
the
flame
of
the
candle
*NL*
with
a
stupid
air
,
and
from
around
the
wick
he
took
some
of
the
burning
*NL*
wax
,
which
he
rolled
between
his
fingers
.
The
old
woman
waited
for
him
.
*NL*
She
even
ventured
to
uplift
her
voice
once
more
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
say
,
Monsieur
le
Maire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
that
it
is
well
,
and
that
I
am
coming
down

CHAPTER
V
--
HINDRANCES
*NL*
*NL*
The
posting
service
from
Arras
to
M.
sur
M.
was
still
operated
at
this
*NL*
period
by
small
mail-wagons
of
the
time
of
the
Empire
.
These
mail-wagons
*NL*
were
two-wheeled
cabriolets
,
upholstered
inside
with
fawn-colored
*NL*
leather
,
hung
on
springs
,
and
having
but
two
seats
,
one
for
the
postboy
,
*NL*
the
other
for
the
traveller
.
The
wheels
were
armed
with
those
long
,
*NL*
offensive
axles
which
keep
other
vehicles
at
a
distance
,
and
which
*NL*
may
still
be
seen
on
the
road
in
Germany
.
The
despatch
box
,
an
immense
*NL*
oblong
coffer
,
was
placed
behind
the
vehicle
and
formed
a
part
of
it
.
*NL*
This
coffer
was
painted
black
,
and
the
cabriolet
yellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
vehicles
,
which
have
no
counterparts
nowadays
,
had
something
*NL*
distorted
and
hunchbacked
about
them
;
and
when
one
saw
them
passing
in
*NL*
the
distance
,
and
climbing
up
some
road
to
the
horizon
,
they
resembled
*NL*
the
insects
which
are
called
,
I
think
,
termites
,
and
which
,
though
with
*NL*
but
little
corselet
,
drag
a
great
train
behind
them
.
But
they
travelled
*NL*
at
a
very
rapid
rate
.
The
post-wagon
which
set
out
from
Arras
at
one
*NL*
o'clock
every
night
,
after
the
mail
from
Paris
had
passed
,
arrived
at
M.
*NL*
sur
M.
a
little
before
five
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
the
wagon
which
was
descending
to
M.
sur
M.
by
the
Hesdin
*NL*
road
,
collided
at
the
corner
of
a
street
,
just
as
it
was
entering
the
*NL*
town
,
with
a
little
tilbury
harnessed
to
a
white
horse
,
which
was
going
*NL*
in
the
opposite
direction
,
and
in
which
there
was
but
one
person
,
a
man
*NL*
enveloped
in
a
mantle
.
The
wheel
of
the
tilbury
received
quite
a
violent
*NL*
shock
.
The
postman
shouted
to
the
man
to
stop
,
but
the
traveller
paid
no
*NL*
heed
and
pursued
his
road
at
full
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
is
in
a
devilish
hurry
!
''
said
the
postman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
thus
hastening
on
was
the
one
whom
we
have
just
seen
struggling
*NL*
in
convulsions
which
are
certainly
deserving
of
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whither
was
he
going
?
He
could
not
have
told
.
Why
was
he
hastening
?
*NL*
He
did
not
know
.
He
was
driving
at
random
,
straight
ahead
.
Whither
?
*NL*
To
Arras
,
no
doubt
;
but
he
might
have
been
going
elsewhere
as
well
.
*NL*
At
times
he
was
conscious
of
it
,
and
he
shuddered
.
He
plunged
into
the
*NL*
night
as
into
a
gulf
.
Something
urged
him
forward
;
something
drew
him
*NL*
on
.
No
one
could
have
told
what
was
taking
place
within
him
;
every
one
*NL*
will
understand
it
.
What
man
is
there
who
has
not
entered
,
at
least
once
*NL*
in
his
life
,
into
that
obscure
cavern
of
the
unknown
?
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
had
resolved
on
nothing
,
decided
nothing
,
formed
no
plan
,
*NL*
done
nothing
.
None
of
the
actions
of
his
conscience
had
been
decisive
.
*NL*
He
was
,
more
than
ever
,
as
he
had
been
at
the
first
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
was
he
going
to
Arras
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
what
he
had
already
said
to
himself
when
he
had
hired
*NL*
Scaufflaire
's
cabriolet
:
that
,
whatever
the
result
was
to
be
,
there
was
*NL*
no
reason
why
he
should
not
see
with
his
own
eyes
,
and
judge
of
matters
*NL*
for
himself
;
that
this
was
even
prudent
;
that
he
must
know
what
took
*NL*
place
;
that
no
decision
could
be
arrived
at
without
having
observed
and
*NL*
scrutinized
;
that
one
made
mountains
out
of
everything
from
a
distance
;
*NL*
that
,
at
any
rate
,
when
he
should
have
seen
that
Champmathieu
,
some
*NL*
wretch
,
his
conscience
would
probably
be
greatly
relieved
to
allow
him
*NL*
to
go
to
the
galleys
in
his
stead
;
that
Javert
would
indeed
be
there
;
*NL*
and
that
Brevet
,
that
Chenildieu
,
that
Cochepaille
,
old
convicts
who
*NL*
had
known
him
;
but
they
certainly
would
not
recognize
him
;
--
bah
!
what
an
*NL*
idea
!
that
Javert
was
a
hundred
leagues
from
suspecting
the
truth
;
that
*NL*
all
conjectures
and
all
suppositions
were
fixed
on
Champmathieu
,
and
*NL*
that
there
is
nothing
so
headstrong
as
suppositions
and
conjectures
;
*NL*
that
accordingly
there
was
no
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
it
was
,
no
doubt
,
a
dark
moment
,
but
that
he
should
emerge
from
it
;
*NL*
that
,
after
all
,
he
held
his
destiny
,
however
bad
it
might
be
,
in
his
*NL*
own
hand
;
that
he
was
master
of
it
.
He
clung
to
this
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
bottom
,
to
tell
the
whole
truth
,
he
would
have
preferred
not
to
go
to
*NL*
Arras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
was
going
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
meditated
,
he
whipped
up
his
horse
,
which
was
proceeding
at
that
*NL*
fine
,
regular
,
and
even
trot
which
accomplishes
two
leagues
and
a
half
*NL*
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
proportion
as
the
cabriolet
advanced
,
he
felt
something
within
him
*NL*
draw
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
he
was
in
the
open
country
;
the
town
of
M.
sur
M.
lay
far
*NL*
behind
him
.
He
watched
the
horizon
grow
white
;
he
stared
at
all
the
*NL*
chilly
figures
of
a
winter
's
dawn
as
they
passed
before
his
eyes
,
*NL*
but
without
seeing
them
.
The
morning
has
its
spectres
as
well
as
the
*NL*
evening
.
He
did
not
see
them
;
but
without
his
being
aware
of
it
,
and
by
*NL*
means
of
a
sort
of
penetration
which
was
almost
physical
,
these
black
*NL*
silhouettes
of
trees
and
of
hills
added
some
gloomy
and
sinister
quality
*NL*
to
the
violent
state
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
time
that
he
passed
one
of
those
isolated
dwellings
which
sometimes
*NL*
border
on
the
highway
,
he
said
to
himself
,
``
And
yet
there
are
people
*NL*
there
within
who
are
sleeping
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
trot
of
the
horse
,
the
bells
on
the
harness
,
the
wheels
on
the
road
,
*NL*
produced
a
gentle
,
monotonous
noise
.
These
things
are
charming
when
one
*NL*
is
joyous
,
and
lugubrious
when
one
is
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
broad
daylight
when
he
arrived
at
Hesdin
.
He
halted
in
front
of
*NL*
the
inn
,
to
allow
the
horse
a
breathing
spell
,
and
to
have
him
given
*NL*
some
oats
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
belonged
,
as
Scaufflaire
had
said
,
to
that
small
race
of
the
*NL*
Boulonnais
,
which
has
too
much
head
,
too
much
belly
,
and
not
enough
neck
*NL*
and
shoulders
,
but
which
has
a
broad
chest
,
a
large
crupper
,
thin
,
fine
*NL*
legs
,
and
solid
hoofs
--
a
homely
,
but
a
robust
and
healthy
race
.
The
*NL*
excellent
beast
had
travelled
five
leagues
in
two
hours
,
and
had
not
a
*NL*
drop
of
sweat
on
his
loins
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
get
out
of
the
tilbury
.
The
stableman
who
brought
the
oats
*NL*
suddenly
bent
down
and
examined
the
left
wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
far
in
this
condition
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
with
an
air
of
not
having
roused
himself
from
his
revery
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
come
from
a
great
distance
?
''
went
on
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
leagues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
,
`
Ah
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
bent
down
once
more
,
was
silent
for
a
moment
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
wheel
;
then
he
rose
erect
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
though
this
wheel
has
travelled
five
leagues
,
it
certainly
*NL*
will
not
travel
another
quarter
of
a
league
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
out
of
the
tilbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
you
say
,
my
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
that
it
is
a
miracle
that
you
should
have
travelled
five
leagues
*NL*
without
you
and
your
horse
rolling
into
some
ditch
on
the
highway
.
Just
*NL*
see
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wheel
really
had
suffered
serious
damage
.
The
shock
administered
by
*NL*
the
mail-wagon
had
split
two
spokes
and
strained
the
hub
,
so
that
the
*NL*
nut
no
longer
held
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
friend
,
''
he
said
to
the
stableman
,
``
is
there
a
wheelwright
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
me
the
service
to
go
and
fetch
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
only
a
step
from
here
.
Hey
!
Master
Bourgaillard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Master
Bourgaillard
,
the
wheelwright
,
was
standing
on
his
own
threshold
.
*NL*
He
came
,
examined
the
wheel
and
made
a
grimace
like
a
surgeon
when
the
*NL*
latter
thinks
a
limb
is
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
repair
this
wheel
immediately

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*

In

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
wheelwright
had
seen
at
the
first
glance
that
the
tilbury
was
a
*NL*
hired
vehicle
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
live
in

There
is

added
the
wheelwright

*NL*
``
an
old
calash

The
stableman

the
wheelwright
replied
in
concert

with
a
toss
of
the
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
an
immense
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
Providence
was
intervening
.
That
it
was
it
who
had
*NL*
broken
the
wheel
of
the
tilbury
and
who
was
stopping
him
on
the
road
.
*NL*
He
had
not
yielded
to
this
sort
of
first
summons
;
he
had
just
made
every
*NL*
possible
effort
to
continue
the
journey
;
he
had
loyally
and
scrupulously
*NL*
exhausted
all
means
;
he
had
been
deterred
neither
by
the
season
,
nor
*NL*
fatigue
,
nor
by
the
expense
;
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
*NL*
himself
.
If
he
went
no
further
,
that
was
no
fault
of
his
.
It
did
not
*NL*
concern
him
further
.
It
was
no
longer
his
fault
.
It
was
not
the
act
of
*NL*
his
own
conscience
,
but
the
act
of
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
breathed
again
.
He
breathed
freely
and
to
the
full
extent
of
his
*NL*
lungs
for
the
first
time
since
Javert
's
visit
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
*NL*
hand
of
iron
which
had
held
his
heart
in
its
grasp
for
the
last
twenty
*NL*
hours
had
just
released
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
God
was
for
him
now
,
and
was
manifesting
Himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
himself
that
he
had
done
all
he
could
,
and
that
now
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
retrace
his
steps
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
his
conversation
with
the
wheelwright
had
taken
place
in
a
chamber
*NL*
of
the
inn
,
it
would
have
had
no
witnesses
,
no
one
would
have
heard
him
,
*NL*
things
would
have
rested
there
,
and
it
is
probable
that
we
should
not
*NL*
have
had
to
relate
any
of
the
occurrences
which
the
reader
is
about
*NL*
to
peruse
;
but
this
conversation
had
taken
place
in
the
street
.
Any
*NL*
colloquy
in
the
street
inevitably
attracts
a
crowd
.
There
are
always
*NL*
people
who
ask
nothing
better
than
to
become
spectators
.
While
he
was
*NL*
questioning
the
wheelwright
,
some
people
who
were
passing
back
and
forth
*NL*
halted
around
them
.
After
listening
for
a
few
minutes
,
a
young
lad
,
to
*NL*
whom
no
one
had
paid
any
heed
,
detached
himself
from
the
group
and
ran
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
traveller
,
after
the
inward
deliberation
which
we
*NL*
have
just
described
,
resolved
to
retrace
his
steps
,
this
child
returned
.
*NL*
He
was
accompanied
by
an
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
woman
,
``
my
boy
tells
me
that
you
wish
to
hire
a
*NL*
cabriolet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
simple
words
uttered
by
an
old
woman
led
by
a
child
made
the
*NL*
perspiration
trickle
down
his
limbs
.
He
thought
that
he
beheld
the
hand
*NL*
which
had
relaxed
its
grasp
reappear
in
the
darkness
behind
him
,
ready
*NL*
to
seize
him
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
good
woman
;
I
am
in
search
of
a
cabriolet
which
I
can
hire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
hastened
to
add
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
none
in
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
there
is

''
said
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
interpolated
the
wheelwright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
my
house
,
''
replied
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
.
The
fatal
hand
had
grasped
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
really
had
in
her
shed
a
sort
of
basket
spring-cart
.
*NL*
The
wheelwright
and
the
stable-man
,
in
despair
at
the
prospect
of
the
*NL*
traveller
escaping
their
clutches
,
interfered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
frightful
old
trap
;
it
rests
flat
on
the
axle
;
it
is
an
actual
*NL*
fact
that
the
seats
were
suspended
inside
it
by
leather
thongs
;
the
rain
*NL*
came
into
it
;
the
wheels
were
rusted
and
eaten
with
moisture
;
it
*NL*
would
not
go
much
further
than
the
tilbury
;
a
regular
ramshackle
old
*NL*
stage-wagon
;
the
gentleman
would
make
a
great
mistake
if
he
trusted
*NL*
himself
to
it
,
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
true
;
but
this
trap
,
this
ramshackle
old
vehicle
,
this
*NL*
thing
,
whatever
it
was
,
ran
on
its
two
wheels
and
could
go
to
Arras
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
what
was
asked
,
left
the
tilbury
with
the
wheelwright
to
be
*NL*
repaired
,
intending
to
reclaim
it
on
his
return
,
had
the
white
horse
*NL*
put
to
the
cart
,
climbed
into
it
,
and
resumed
the
road
which
he
had
been
*NL*
travelling
since
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
cart
moved
off
,
he
admitted
that
he
had
felt
,
a
*NL*
moment
previously
,
a
certain
joy
in
the
thought
that
he
should
not
*NL*
go
whither
he
was
now
proceeding
.
He
examined
this
joy
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
wrath
,
and
found
it
absurd
.
Why
should
he
feel
joy
at
turning
back
?
*NL*
After
all
,
he
was
taking
this
trip
of
his
own
free
will
.
No
one
was
*NL*
forcing
him
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
assuredly
nothing
would
happen
except
what
he
should
choose
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
left
Hesdin
,
he
heard
a
voice
shouting
to
him
:
``
Stop
!
Stop
!
''
He
*NL*
halted
the
cart
with
a
vigorous
movement
which
contained
a
feverish
and
*NL*
convulsive
element
resembling
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
old
woman
's
little
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
latter
,
``
it
was
I
who
got
the
cart
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
given
me
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
gave
to
all
so
readily
thought
this
demand
exorbitant
and
almost
*NL*
odious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
's
you
,
you
scamp
?
''
said
he
;
``
you
shall
have
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
whipped
up
his
horse
and
set
off
at
full
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
lost
a
great
deal
of
time
at
Hesdin
.
He
wanted
to
make
it
good
.
*NL*
The
little
horse
was
courageous
,
and
pulled
for
two
;
but
it
was
the
*NL*
month
of
February
,
there
had
been
rain
;
the
roads
were
bad
.
And
then
,
*NL*
it
was
no
longer
the
tilbury
.
The
cart
was
very
heavy
,
and
in
addition
,
*NL*
there
were
many
ascents
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
nearly
four
hours
to
go
from
Hesdin
to
Saint-Pol
;
four
hours
for
*NL*
five
leagues
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Saint-Pol
he
had
the
horse
unharnessed
at
the
first
inn
he
came
to
*NL*
and
led
to
the
stable
;
as
he
had
promised
Scaufflaire
,
he
stood
beside
*NL*
the
manger
while
the
horse
was
eating
;
he
thought
of
sad
and
confusing
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn-keeper
's
wife
came
to
the
stable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
not
Monsieur
wish
to
breakfast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
that
is
true
;
I
even
have
a
good
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
the
woman
,
who
had
a
rosy
,
cheerful
face
;
she
led
him
to
the
*NL*
public
room
where
there
were
tables
covered
with
waxed
cloth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
!
''
said
he
;
``
I
must
start
again
;
I
am
in
a
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
big
Flemish
servant-maid
placed
his
knife
and
fork
in
all
haste
;
he
*NL*
looked
at
the
girl
with
a
sensation
of
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
ailed
me
,
''
he
thought
;
``
I
had
not
breakfasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
breakfast
was
served
;
he
seized
the
bread
,
took
a
mouthful
,
and
then
*NL*
slowly
replaced
it
on
the
table
,
and
did
not
touch
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
carter
was
eating
at
another
table
;
he
said
to
this
man
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
is
their
bread
so
bitter
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carter
was
a
German
and
did
not
understand
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
the
stable
and
remained
near
the
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
he
had
quitted
Saint-Pol
and
was
directing
his
course
*NL*
towards
Tinques
,
which
is
only
five
leagues
from
Arras
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
do
during
this
journey
?
Of
what
was
he
thinking
?
As
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
he
watched
the
trees
,
the
thatched
roofs
,
the
tilled
fields
*NL*
pass
by
,
and
the
way
in
which
the
landscape
,
broken
at
every
turn
of
the
*NL*
road
,
vanished
;
this
is
a
sort
of
contemplation
which
sometimes
*NL*
suffices
to
the
soul
,
and
almost
relieves
it
from
thought
.
What
is
more
*NL*
melancholy
and
more
profound
than
to
see
a
thousand
objects
for
the
*NL*
first
and
the
last
time
?
To
travel
is
to
be
born
and
to
die
at
every
*NL*
instant
;
perhaps
,
in
the
vaguest
region
of
his
mind
,
he
did
make
*NL*
comparisons
between
the
shifting
horizon
and
our
human
existence
:
all
*NL*
the
things
of
life
are
perpetually
fleeing
before
us
;
the
dark
and
*NL*
bright
intervals
are
intermingled
;
after
a
dazzling
moment
,
an
eclipse
;
*NL*
we
look
,
we
hasten
,
we
stretch
out
our
hands
to
grasp
what
is
passing
;
*NL*
each
event
is
a
turn
in
the
road
,
and
,
all
at
once
,
we
are
old
;
we
feel
*NL*
a
shock
;
all
is
black
;
we
distinguish
an
obscure
door
;
the
gloomy
*NL*
horse
of
life
,
which
has
been
drawing
us
halts
,
and
we
see
a
veiled
and
*NL*
unknown
person
unharnessing
amid
the
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twilight
was
falling
when
the
children
who
were
coming
out
of
school
*NL*
beheld
this
traveller
enter
Tinques
;
it
is
true
that
the
days
were
still
*NL*
short
;
he
did
not
halt
at
Tinques
;
as
he
emerged
from
the
village
,
a
*NL*
laborer
,
who
was
mending
the
road
with
stones
,
raised
his
head
and
said
*NL*
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
horse
is
very
much
fatigued
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
beast
was
,
in
fact
,
going
at
a
walk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
Arras
?
''
added
the
road-mender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
go
on
at
that
rate
you
will
not
arrive
very
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
his
horse
,
and
asked
the
laborer
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
far
is
it
from
here
to
Arras
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
seven
good
leagues
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
?
the
posting
guide
only
says
five
leagues
and
a
quarter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
returned
the
road-mender
,
``
so
you
do
n't
know
that
the
road
is
*NL*
under
repair
?
You
will
find
it
barred
a
quarter
of
an
hour
further
on
;
*NL*
there
is
no
way
to
proceed
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
take
the
road
on
the
left
,
leading
to
Carency
;
you
will
cross
*NL*
the
river
;
when
you
reach
Camblin
,
you
will
turn
to
the
right
;
that
is
*NL*
the
road
to
Mont-Saint-Eloy
which
leads
to
Arras
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
night
,
and
I
shall
lose
my
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
belong
in
these
parts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
besides
,
it
is
all
cross-roads
;
stop
!
sir
,
''
resumed
the
*NL*
road-mender
;
``
shall
I
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
?
your
horse
is
tired
;
*NL*
return
to
Tinques
;
there
is
a
good
inn
there
;
sleep
there
;
you
can
reach
*NL*
Arras
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
there
this
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
different
;
but
go
to
the
inn
all
the
same
,
and
get
an
extra
*NL*
horse
;
the
stable-boy
will
guide
you
through
the
cross-roads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
the
road-mender
's
advice
,
retraced
his
steps
,
and
,
half
an
*NL*
hour
later
,
he
passed
the
same
spot
again
,
but
this
time
at
full
speed
,
*NL*
with
a
good
horse
to
aid
;
a
stable-boy
,
who
called
himself
a
postilion
,
*NL*
was
seated
on
the
shaft
of
the
cariole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
he
felt
that
he
had
lost
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
fully
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
turned
into
the
cross-road
;
the
way
became
frightfully
bad
;
the
*NL*
cart
lurched
from
one
rut
to
the
other
;
he
said
to
the
postilion
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
at
a
trot
,
and
you
shall
have
a
double
fee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
the
jolts
,
the
whiffle-tree
broke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
whiffle-tree
broken
,
sir
,
''
said
the
postilion
;
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
harness
my
horse
now
;
this
road
is
very
bad
at
night
;
if
*NL*
you
wish
to
return
and
sleep
at
Tinques
,
we
could
be
in
Arras
early
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
``
Have
you
a
bit
of
rope
and
a
knife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cut
a
branch
from
a
tree
and
made
a
whiffle-tree
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
caused
another
loss
of
twenty
minutes
;
but
they
set
out
again
at
a
*NL*
gallop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plain
was
gloomy
;
low-hanging
,
black
,
crisp
fogs
crept
over
the
*NL*
hills
and
wrenched
themselves
away
like
smoke
:
there
were
whitish
gleams
*NL*
in
the
clouds
;
a
strong
breeze
which
blew
in
from
the
sea
produced
a
*NL*
sound
in
all
quarters
of
the
horizon
,
as
of
some
one
moving
furniture
;
*NL*
everything
that
could
be
seen
assumed
attitudes
of
terror
.
How
many
*NL*
things
shiver
beneath
these
vast
breaths
of
the
night
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
stiff
with
cold
;
he
had
eaten
nothing
since
the
night
before
;
*NL*
he
vaguely
recalled
his
other
nocturnal
trip
in
the
vast
plain
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
of
D
--
,
eight
years
previously
,
and
it
seemed
but
*NL*
yesterday
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
struck
from
a
distant
tower
;
he
asked
the
boy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seven
o'clock
,
sir
;
we
shall
reach
Arras
at
eight
;
we
have
but
three
*NL*
leagues
still
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
for
the
first
time
indulged
in
this
reflection
,
*NL*
thinking
it
odd
the
while
that
it
had
not
occurred
to
him
sooner
:
that
*NL*
all
this
trouble
which
he
was
taking
was
,
perhaps
,
useless
;
that
he
did
*NL*
not
know
so
much
as
the
hour
of
the
trial
;
that
he
should
,
at
least
,
*NL*
have
informed
himself
of
that
;
that
he
was
foolish
to
go
thus
straight
*NL*
ahead
without
knowing
whether
he
would
be
of
any
service
or
not
;
then
*NL*
he
sketched
out
some
calculations
in
his
mind
:
that
,
ordinarily
,
the
*NL*
sittings
of
the
Court
of
Assizes
began
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
;
*NL*
that
it
could
not
be
a
long
affair
;
that
the
theft
of
the
apples
would
*NL*
be
very
brief
;
that
there
would
then
remain
only
a
question
of
identity
,
*NL*
four
or
five
depositions
,
and
very
little
for
the
lawyers
to
say
;
that
*NL*
he
should
arrive
after
all
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postilion
whipped
up
the
horses
;
they
had
crossed
the
river
and
left
*NL*
Mont-Saint-Eloy
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
grew
more
profound
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
SISTER
SIMPLICE
PUT
TO
THE
PROOF
*NL*
*NL*
But
at
that
moment
Fantine
was
joyous
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
passed
a
very
bad
night
;
her
cough
was
frightful
;
her
fever
*NL*
had
doubled
in
intensity
;
she
had
had
dreams
:
in
the
morning
,
when
the
*NL*
doctor
paid
his
visit
,
she
was
delirious
;
he
assumed
an
alarmed
look
,
*NL*
and
ordered
that
he
should
be
informed
as
soon
as
M.
Madeleine
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
morning
she
was
melancholy
,
said
but
little
,
and
laid
plaits
*NL*
in
her
sheets
,
murmuring
the
while
,
in
a
low
voice
,
calculations
*NL*
which
seemed
to
be
calculations
of
distances
.
Her
eyes
were
hollow
and
*NL*
staring
.
They
seemed
almost
extinguished
at
intervals
,
then
lighted
up
*NL*
again
and
shone
like
stars
.
It
seems
as
though
,
at
the
approach
of
a
*NL*
certain
dark
hour
,
the
light
of
heaven
fills
those
who
are
quitting
the
*NL*
light
of
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
time
that
Sister
Simplice
asked
her
how
she
felt
,
she
replied
*NL*
invariably
,
``
Well
.
I
should
like
to
see
M.
Madeleine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
months
before
this
,
at
the
moment
when
Fantine
had
just
lost
her
*NL*
last
modesty
,
her
last
shame
,
and
her
last
joy
,
she
was
the
shadow
of
*NL*
herself
;
now
she
was
the
spectre
of
herself
.
Physical
suffering
had
*NL*
completed
the
work
of
moral
suffering
.
This
creature
of
five
and
twenty
*NL*
had
a
wrinkled
brow
,
flabby
cheeks
,
pinched
nostrils
,
teeth
from
which
*NL*
the
gums
had
receded
,
a
leaden
complexion
,
a
bony
neck
,
prominent
*NL*
shoulder-blades
,
frail
limbs
,
a
clayey
skin
,
and
her
golden
hair
was
*NL*
growing
out
sprinkled
with
gray
.
Alas
!
how
illness
improvises
old-age
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
mid-day
the
physician
returned
,
gave
some
directions
,
inquired
*NL*
whether
the
mayor
had
made
his
appearance
at
the
infirmary
,
and
shook
*NL*
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
usually
came
to
see
the
invalid
at
three
o'clock
.
As
*NL*
exactness
is
kindness
,
he
was
exact
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
half-past
two
,
Fantine
began
to
be
restless
.
In
the
course
of
*NL*
twenty
minutes
,
she
asked
the
nun
more
than
ten
times
,
``
What
time
is
it
,
*NL*
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
o'clock
struck
.
At
the
third
stroke
,
Fantine
sat
up
in
bed
;
she
*NL*
who
could
,
in
general
,
hardly
turn
over
,
joined
her
yellow
,
fleshless
*NL*
hands
in
a
sort
of
convulsive
clasp
,
and
the
nun
heard
her
utter
one
*NL*
of
those
profound
sighs
which
seem
to
throw
off
dejection
.
Then
Fantine
*NL*
turned
and
looked
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
entered
;
the
door
did
not
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
thus
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
her
eyes
riveted
on
the
*NL*
door
,
motionless
and
apparently
holding
her
breath
.
The
sister
dared
not
*NL*
speak
to
her
.
The
clock
struck
a
quarter
past
three
.
Fantine
fell
back
*NL*
on
her
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
,
but
began
to
plait
the
sheets
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
passed
,
then
an
hour
,
no
one
came
;
every
time
the
clock
*NL*
struck
,
Fantine
started
up
and
looked
towards
the
door
,
then
fell
back
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
thought
was
clearly
perceptible
,
but
she
uttered
no
name
,
she
made
*NL*
no
complaint
,
she
blamed
no
one
.
But
she
coughed
in
a
melancholy
way
.
*NL*
One
would
have
said
that
something
dark
was
descending
upon
her
.
She
was
*NL*
livid
and
her
lips
were
blue
.
She
smiled
now
and
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
o'clock
struck
.
Then
the
sister
heard
her
say
,
very
low
and
gently
,
*NL*
``
He
is
wrong
not
to
come
to-day
,
since
I
am
going
away
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Simplice
herself
was
surprised
at
M.
Madeleine
's
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Fantine
was
staring
at
the
tester
of
her
bed
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
be
endeavoring
to
recall
something
.
All
at
once
she
began
to
*NL*
sing
in
a
voice
as
feeble
as
a
breath
.
The
nun
listened
.
This
is
what
*NL*
Fantine
was
singing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovely
things
we
will
buy
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
This
song
was
an
old
cradle
romance
with
which
she
had
,
in
former
days
,
*NL*
lulled
her
little
Cosette
to
sleep
,
and
which
had
never
recurred
to
her
*NL*
mind
in
all
the
five
years
during
which
she
had
been
parted
from
her
*NL*
child
.
She
sang
it
in
so
sad
a
voice
,
and
to
so
sweet
an
air
,
that
it
*NL*
was
enough
to
make
any
one
,
even
a
nun
,
weep
.
The
sister
,
accustomed
as
*NL*
she
was
to
austerities
,
felt
a
tear
spring
to
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
struck
six
.
Fantine
did
not
seem
to
hear
it
.
She
no
longer
*NL*
seemed
to
pay
attention
to
anything
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Simplice
sent
a
serving-maid
to
inquire
of
the
portress
of
the
*NL*
factory
,
whether
the
mayor
had
returned
,
and
if
he
would
not
come
to
the
*NL*
infirmary
soon
.
The
girl
returned
in
a
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
was
still
motionless
and
seemed
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
informed
Sister
Simplice
in
a
very
low
tone
,
that
the
*NL*
mayor
had
set
out
that
morning
before
six
o'clock
,
in
a
little
tilbury
*NL*
harnessed
to
a
white
horse
,
cold
as
the
weather
was
;
that
he
had
gone
*NL*
alone
,
without
even
a
driver
;
that
no
one
knew
what
road
he
had
taken
;
*NL*
that
people
said
he
had
been
seen
to
turn
into
the
road
to
Arras
;
that
*NL*
others
asserted
that
they
had
met
him
on
the
road
to
Paris
.
That
when
he
*NL*
went
away
he
had
been
very
gentle
,
as
usual
,
and
that
he
had
merely
told
*NL*
the
portress
not
to
expect
him
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
two
women
were
whispering
together
,
with
their
backs
turned
*NL*
to
Fantine
's
bed
,
the
sister
interrogating
,
the
servant
conjecturing
,
*NL*
Fantine
,
with
the
feverish
vivacity
of
certain
organic
maladies
,
which
*NL*
unite
the
free
movements
of
health
with
the
frightful
emaciation
of
*NL*
death
,
had
raised
herself
to
her
knees
in
bed
,
with
her
shrivelled
hands
*NL*
resting
on
the
bolster
,
and
her
head
thrust
through
the
opening
of
the
*NL*
curtains
,
and
was
listening
.
All
at
once
she
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
speaking
of
M.
Madeleine
!
Why
are
you
talking
so
low
?
What
is
*NL*
he
doing
?
Why
does
he
not
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
voice
was
so
abrupt
and
hoarse
that
the
two
women
thought
they
heard
*NL*
the
voice
of
a
man
;
they
wheeled
round
in
affright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
me
!
''
cried
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
stammered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
portress
told
me
that
he
could
not
come
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
calm
,
my
child
,
''
said
the
sister
;
``
lie
down
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
,
without
changing
her
attitude
,
continued
in
a
loud
voice
,
and
*NL*
with
an
accent
that
was
both
imperious
and
heart-rending
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
not
come
?
Why
not
?
You
know
the
reason
.
You
are
whispering
it
to
*NL*
each
other
there
.
I
want
to
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant-maid
hastened
to
say
in
the
nun
's
ear
,
``
Say
that
he
is
busy
*NL*
with
the
city
council
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Simplice
blushed
faintly
,
for
it
was
a
lie
that
the
maid
had
*NL*
proposed
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
other
hand
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
mere
communication
of
the
*NL*
truth
to
the
invalid
would
,
without
doubt
,
deal
her
a
terrible
blow
,
and
*NL*
that
this
was
a
serious
matter
in
Fantine
's
present
state
.
Her
flush
*NL*
did
not
last
long
;
the
sister
raised
her
calm
,
sad
eyes
to
Fantine
,
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Monsieur
le
Maire
has
gone
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
raised
herself
and
crouched
on
her
heels
in
the
bed
:
her
eyes
*NL*
sparkled
;
indescribable
joy
beamed
from
that
melancholy
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gone
!
''
she
cried
;
``
he
has
gone
to
get
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
raised
her
arms
to
heaven
,
and
her
white
face
became
ineffable
;
*NL*
her
lips
moved
;
she
was
praying
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
prayer
was
finished
,
``
Sister
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
am
willing
to
lie
*NL*
down
again
;
I
will
do
anything
you
wish
;
I
was
naughty
just
now
;
I
beg
*NL*
your
pardon
for
having
spoken
so
loud
;
it
is
very
wrong
to
talk
loudly
;
*NL*
I
know
that
well
,
my
good
sister
,
but
,
you
see
,
I
am
very
happy
:
the
*NL*
good
God
is
good
;
M.
Madeleine
is
good
;
just
think
!
he
has
gone
to
*NL*
Montfermeil
to
get
my
little
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lay
down
again
,
with
the
nun
's
assistance
,
helped
the
nun
to
arrange
*NL*
her
pillow
,
and
kissed
the
little
silver
cross
which
she
wore
on
her
*NL*
neck
,
and
which
Sister
Simplice
had
given
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
''
said
the
sister
,
``
try
to
rest
now
,
and
do
not
talk
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
took
the
sister
's
hand
in
her
moist
hands
,
and
the
latter
was
*NL*
pained
to
feel
that
perspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
set
out
this
morning
for
Paris
;
in
fact
,
he
need
not
even
go
through
*NL*
Paris
;
Montfermeil
is
a
little
to
the
left
as
you
come
thence
.
Do
you
*NL*
remember
how
he
said
to
me
yesterday
,
when
I
spoke
to
him
of
Cosette
,
*NL*
Soon
,
soon
?
He
wants
to
give
me
a
surprise
,
you
know
!
he
made
me
sign
a
*NL*
letter
so
that
she
could
be
taken
from
the
Thenardiers
;
they
can
not
*NL*
say
anything
,
can
they
?
they
will
give
back
Cosette
,
for
they
have
been
*NL*
paid
;
the
authorities
will
not
allow
them
to
keep
the
child
since
they
*NL*
have
received
their
pay
.
Do
not
make
signs
to
me
that
I
must
not
talk
,
*NL*
sister
!
I
am
extremely
happy
;
I
am
doing
well
;
I
am
not
ill
at
all
any
*NL*
more
;
I
am
going
to
see
Cosette
again
;
I
am
even
quite
hungry
;
it
is
*NL*
nearly
five
years
since
I
saw
her
last
;
you
can
not
imagine
how
much
*NL*
attached
one
gets
to
children
,
and
then
,
she
will
be
so
pretty
;
you
will
*NL*
see
!
If
you
only
knew
what
pretty
little
rosy
fingers
she
had
!
In
the
*NL*
first
place
,
she
will
have
very
beautiful
hands
;
she
had
ridiculous
*NL*
hands
when
she
was
only
a
year
old
;
like
this
!
she
must
be
a
big
girl
*NL*
now
;
she
is
seven
years
old
;
she
is
quite
a
young
lady
;
I
call
her
*NL*
Cosette
,
but
her
name
is
really
Euphrasie
.
Stop
!
this
morning
I
was
*NL*
looking
at
the
dust
on
the
chimney-piece
,
and
I
had
a
sort
of
idea
come
*NL*
across
me
,
like
that
,
that
I
should
see
Cosette
again
soon
.
Mon
Dieu
!
*NL*
how
wrong
it
is
not
to
see
one
's
children
for
years
!
One
ought
to
*NL*
reflect
that
life
is
not
eternal
.
Oh
,
how
good
M.
le
Maire
is
to
go
!
it
*NL*
is
very
cold
!
it
is
true
;
he
had
on
his
cloak
,
at
least
?
he
will
be
*NL*
here
to-morrow
,
will
he
not
?
to-morrow
will
be
a
festival
day
;
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
,
sister
,
you
must
remind
me
to
put
on
my
little
cap
that
has
*NL*
lace
on
it
.
What
a
place
that
Montfermeil
is
!
I
took
that
journey
on
*NL*
foot
once
;
it
was
very
long
for
me
,
but
the
diligences
go
very
quickly
!
*NL*
he
will
be
here
to-morrow
with
Cosette
:
how
far
is
it
from
here
to
*NL*
Montfermeil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
,
who
had
no
idea
of
distances
,
replied
,
``
Oh
,
I
think
that
he
*NL*
will
be
here
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
!
to-morrow
!
''
said
Fantine
,
``
I
shall
see
Cosette
to-morrow
!
*NL*
you
see
,
good
sister
of
the
good
God
,
that
I
am
no
longer
ill
;
I
am
mad
;
*NL*
I
could
dance
if
any
one
wished
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
person
who
had
seen
her
a
quarter
of
an
hour
previously
would
not
have
*NL*
understood
the
change
;
she
was
all
rosy
now
;
she
spoke
in
a
lively
and
*NL*
natural
voice
;
her
whole
face
was
one
smile
;
now
and
then
she
talked
,
*NL*
she
laughed
softly
;
the
joy
of
a
mother
is
almost
infantile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
resumed
the
nun
,
``
now
that
you
are
happy
,
mind
me
,
and
do
not
*NL*
talk
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
laid
her
head
on
her
pillow
and
said
in
a
low
voice
:
``
Yes
,
*NL*
lie
down
again

be
good

And
then
,
without
stirring
,
without
even
moving
her
head
,
she
began
to
*NL*
stare
all
about
her
with
wide-open
eyes
and
a
joyous
air
,
and
she
said
*NL*
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
drew
the
curtains
together
again
,
hoping
that
she
would
*NL*
fall
into
a
doze
.
Between
seven
and
eight
o'clock
the
doctor
came
;
not
*NL*
hearing
any
sound
,
he
thought
Fantine
was
asleep
,
entered
softly
,
and
*NL*
approached
the
bed
on
tiptoe
;
he
opened
the
curtains
a
little
,
and
,
by
*NL*
the
light
of
the
taper
,
he
saw
Fantine
's
big
eyes
gazing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
to
him
,
``
She
will
be
allowed
to
sleep
beside
me
in
a
little
*NL*
bed
,
will
she
not
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
thought
that
she
was
delirious
.
She
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
!
there
is
just
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
took
Sister
Simplice
aside
,
and
she
explained
matters
to
him
;
*NL*
that
M.
Madeleine
was
absent
for
a
day
or
two
,
and
that
in
their
doubt
*NL*
they
had
not
thought
it
well
to
undeceive
the
invalid
,
who
believed
that
*NL*
the
mayor
had
gone
to
Montfermeil
;
that
it
was
possible
,
after
all
,
that
*NL*
her
guess
was
correct
:
the
doctor
approved
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
to
Fantine
's
bed
,
and
she
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
when
she
wakes
up
in
the
morning
,
I
shall
be
able
to
say
good
*NL*
morning
to
her
,
poor
kitten
,
and
when
I
can
not
sleep
at
night
,
I
can
*NL*
hear
her
asleep
;
her
little
gentle
breathing
will
do
me
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
hand
,
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stretched
out
her
arm
,
and
exclaimed
with
a
laugh
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
hold
!
in
truth
,
you
did
not
know
it
;
I
am
cured
;
Cosette
will
*NL*
arrive
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
was
surprised
;
she
was
better
;
the
pressure
on
her
chest
*NL*
had
decreased
;
her
pulse
had
regained
its
strength
;
a
sort
of
life
had
*NL*
suddenly
supervened
and
reanimated
this
poor
,
worn-out
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
she
went
on
,
``
did
the
sister
tell
you
that
M.
le
Maire
has
*NL*
gone
to
get
that
mite
of
a
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
recommended
silence
,
and
that
all
painful
emotions
should
be
*NL*
avoided
;
he
prescribed
an
infusion
of
pure
chinchona
,
and
,
in
case
the
*NL*
fever
should
increase
again
during
the
night
,
a
calming
potion
.
As
he
*NL*
took
his
departure
,
he
said
to
the
sister
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
doing
better
;
if
good
luck
willed
that
the
mayor
should
*NL*
actually
arrive
to-morrow
with
the
child
,
who
knows
?
there
are
crises
*NL*
so
astounding
;
great
joy
has
been
known
to
arrest
maladies
;
I
know
well
*NL*
that
this
is
an
organic
disease
,
and
in
an
advanced
state
,
but
all
those
*NL*
things
are
such
mysteries
:
we
may
be
able
to
save
her

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
TRAVELLER
ON
HIS
ARRIVAL
TAKES
PRECAUTIONS
FOR
*NL*
DEPARTURE
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
when
the
cart
,
which
we
*NL*
left
on
the
road
,
entered
the
porte-cochere
of
the
Hotel
de
la
Poste
in
*NL*
Arras
;
the
man
whom
we
have
been
following
up
to
this
moment
alighted
*NL*
from
it
,
responded
with
an
abstracted
air
to
the
attentions
of
the
*NL*
people
of
the
inn
,
sent
back
the
extra
horse
,
and
with
his
own
hands
*NL*
led
the
little
white
horse
to
the
stable
;
then
he
opened
the
door
of
a
*NL*
billiard-room
which
was
situated
on
the
ground
floor
,
sat
down
there
,
*NL*
and
leaned
his
elbows
on
a
table
;
he
had
taken
fourteen
hours
for
*NL*
the
journey
which
he
had
counted
on
making
in
six
;
he
did
himself
the
*NL*
justice
to
acknowledge
that
it
was
not
his
fault
,
but
at
bottom
,
he
was
*NL*
not
sorry
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
of
the
hotel
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
Monsieur
wish
a
bed
?
Does
Monsieur
require
supper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
sign
of
the
head
in
the
negative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
stableman
says
that
Monsieur
's
horse
is
extremely
fatigued
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
broke
his
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
not
the
horse
be
in
a
condition
to
set
out
again
to-morrow
*NL*
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Monsieur
!
he
must
rest
for
two
days
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
the
posting-station
located
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hostess
conducted
him
to
the
office
;
he
showed
his
passport
,
and
*NL*
inquired
whether
there
was
any
way
of
returning
that
same
night
to
M.
*NL*
sur
M.
by
the
mail-wagon
;
the
seat
beside
the
post-boy
chanced
to
be
*NL*
vacant
;
he
engaged
it
and
paid
for
it
.
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
the
clerk
,
*NL*
``
do
not
fail
to
be
here
ready
to
start
at
precisely
one
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
done
,
he
left
the
hotel
and
began
to
wander
about
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
acquainted
with
Arras
;
the
streets
were
dark
,
and
he
*NL*
walked
on
at
random
;
but
he
seemed
bent
upon
not
asking
the
way
of
the
*NL*
passers-by
.
He
crossed
the
little
river
Crinchon
,
and
found
himself
in
a
*NL*
labyrinth
of
narrow
alleys
where
he
lost
his
way
.
A
citizen
was
passing
*NL*
along
with
a
lantern
.
After
some
hesitation
,
he
decided
to
apply
to
this
*NL*
man
,
not
without
having
first
glanced
behind
and
in
front
of
him
,
as
*NL*
though
he
feared
lest
some
one
should
hear
the
question
which
he
was
*NL*
about
to
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
he
,
``
where
is
the
court-house
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
belong
in
town
,
sir
?
''
replied
the
bourgeois
,
who
was
an
*NL*
oldish
man
;
``
well
,
follow
me
.
I
happen
to
be
going
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
court-house
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
the
direction
of
the
hotel
of
the
*NL*
prefecture
;
for
the
court-house
is
undergoing
repairs
just
at
this
*NL*
moment
,
and
the
courts
are
holding
their
sittings
provisionally
in
the
*NL*
prefecture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
there
that
the
Assizes
are
held
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir
;
you
see
,
the
prefecture
of
to-day
was
the
bishop
's
*NL*
palace
before
the
Revolution
.
M.
de
Conzie
,
who
was
bishop
in
'
82
,
built
*NL*
a
grand
hall
there
.
It
is
in
this
grand
hall
that
the
court
is
held
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
,
the
bourgeois
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Monsieur
desires
to
witness
a
case
,
it
is
rather
late
.
The
sittings
*NL*
generally
close
at
six
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
arrived
on
the
grand
square
,
however
,
the
man
pointed
out
to
*NL*
him
four
long
windows
all
lighted
up
,
in
the
front
of
a
vast
and
gloomy
*NL*
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
sir
,
you
are
in
luck
;
you
have
arrived
in
season
.
Do
you
*NL*
see
those
four
windows
?
That
is
the
Court
of
Assizes
.
There
is
light
*NL*
there
,
so
they
are
not
through
.
The
matter
must
have
been
greatly
*NL*
protracted
,
and
they
are
holding
an
evening
session
.
Do
you
take
an
*NL*
interest
in
this
affair
?
Is
it
a
criminal
case
?
Are
you
a
witness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
come
on
any
business
;
I
only
wish
to
speak
to
one
of
the
*NL*
lawyers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
different
,
''
said
the
bourgeois
.
``
Stop
,
sir
;
here
is
the
door
*NL*
where
the
sentry
stands
.
You
have
only
to
ascend
the
grand
staircase
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
conformed
to
the
bourgeois
's
directions
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
he
*NL*
was
in
a
hall
containing
many
people
,
and
where
groups
,
intermingled
*NL*
with
lawyers
in
their
gowns
,
were
whispering
together
here
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
always
a
heart-breaking
thing
to
see
these
congregations
of
men
*NL*
robed
in
black
,
murmuring
together
in
low
voices
,
on
the
threshold
of
*NL*
the
halls
of
justice
.
It
is
rare
that
charity
and
pity
are
the
outcome
*NL*
of
these
words
.
Condemnations
pronounced
in
advance
are
more
likely
*NL*
to
be
the
result
.
All
these
groups
seem
to
the
passing
and
thoughtful
*NL*
observer
so
many
sombre
hives
where
buzzing
spirits
construct
in
concert
*NL*
all
sorts
of
dark
edifices
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
spacious
hall
,
illuminated
by
a
single
lamp
,
was
the
old
hall
of
*NL*
the
episcopal
palace
,
and
served
as
the
large
hall
of
the
palace
*NL*
of
justice
.
A
double-leaved
door
,
which
was
closed
at
that
moment
,
*NL*
separated
it
from
the
large
apartment
where
the
court
was
sitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
obscurity
was
such
that
he
did
not
fear
to
accost
the
first
lawyer
*NL*
whom
he
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
stage
have
they
reached
,
sir
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
finished
,
''
said
the
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finished
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
was
repeated
in
such
accents
that
the
lawyer
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
sir
;
perhaps
you
are
a
relative
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
know
no
one
here
.
Has
judgment
been
pronounced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
Nothing
else
was
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
penal
servitude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
,
in
a
voice
so
weak
that
it
was
barely
audible
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
his
identity
was
established
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
identity
?
''
replied
the
lawyer
.
``
There
was
no
identity
to
be
*NL*
established
.
The
matter
was
very
simple
.
The
woman
had
murdered
her
*NL*
child
;
the
infanticide
was
proved
;
the
jury
threw
out
the
question
of
*NL*
premeditation
,
and
she
was
condemned
for
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
was
a
woman
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
certainly
.
The
Limosin
woman
.
Of
what
are
you
speaking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
But
since
it
is
all
over
,
how
comes
it
that
the
hall
is
still
*NL*
lighted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
another
case
,
which
was
begun
about
two
hours
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
other
case
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
this
one
is
a
clear
case
also
.
It
is
about
a
sort
of
blackguard
;
*NL*
a
man
arrested
for
a
second
offence
;
a
convict
who
has
been
guilty
of
*NL*
theft
.
I
do
n't
know
his
name
exactly
.
There
's
a
bandit
's
phiz
for
you
!
*NL*
I
'd
send
him
to
the
galleys
on
the
strength
of
his
face
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
way
of
getting
into
the
court-room
,
sir
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
think
that
there
is
not
.
There
is
a
great
crowd
.
However
,
*NL*
the
hearing
has
been
suspended
.
Some
people
have
gone
out
,
and
when
the
*NL*
hearing
is
resumed
,
you
might
make
an
effort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
entrance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
yonder
large
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lawyer
left
him
.
In
the
course
of
a
few
moments
he
had
experienced
,
*NL*
almost
simultaneously
,
almost
intermingled
with
each
other
,
all
possible
*NL*
emotions
.
The
words
of
this
indifferent
spectator
had
,
in
turn
,
pierced
*NL*
his
heart
like
needles
of
ice
and
like
blades
of
fire
.
When
he
saw
that
*NL*
nothing
was
settled
,
he
breathed
freely
once
more
;
but
he
could
not
have
*NL*
told
whether
what
he
felt
was
pain
or
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
near
to
many
groups
and
listened
to
what
they
were
saying
.
The
*NL*
docket
of
the
session
was
very
heavy
;
the
president
had
appointed
*NL*
for
the
same
day
two
short
and
simple
cases
.
They
had
begun
with
the
*NL*
infanticide
,
and
now
they
had
reached
the
convict
,
the
old
offender
,
the
*NL*
``
return
horse
.
''
This
man
had
stolen
apples
,
but
that
did
not
appear
to
*NL*
be
entirely
proved
;
what
had
been
proved
was
,
that
he
had
already
been
*NL*
in
the
galleys
at
Toulon
.
It
was
that
which
lent
a
bad
aspect
to
*NL*
his
case
.
However
,
the
man
's
examination
and
the
depositions
of
the
*NL*
witnesses
had
been
completed
,
but
the
lawyer
's
plea
,
and
the
speech
*NL*
of
the
public
prosecutor
were
still
to
come
;
it
could
not
be
*NL*
finished
before
midnight
.
The
man
would
probably
be
condemned
;
the
*NL*
attorney-general
was
very
clever
,
and
never
missed
his
culprits
;
he
was
*NL*
a
brilliant
fellow
who
wrote
verses
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
usher
stood
at
the
door
communicating
with
the
hall
of
the
Assizes
.
*NL*
He
inquired
of
this
usher
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
the
door
be
opened
soon
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
be
opened
at
all
,
''
replied
the
usher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
It
will
not
be
opened
when
the
hearing
is
resumed
?
Is
not
the
*NL*
hearing
suspended
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
hearing
has
just
been
begun
again
,
''
replied
the
usher
,
``
but
the
*NL*
door
will
not
be
opened
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
the
hall
is
full
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
There
is
not
room
for
one
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
another
one
.
The
door
is
closed
.
No
one
can
enter
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
added
after
a
pause
:
``
There
are
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
two
*NL*
or
three
extra
places
behind
Monsieur
le
President
,
but
Monsieur
le
*NL*
President
only
admits
public
functionaries
to
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
the
usher
turned
his
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
retired
with
bowed
head
,
traversed
the
antechamber
,
and
slowly
*NL*
descended
the
stairs
,
as
though
hesitating
at
every
step
.
It
is
probable
*NL*
that
he
was
holding
counsel
with
himself
.
The
violent
conflict
which
had
*NL*
been
going
on
within
him
since
the
preceding
evening
was
not
yet
ended
;
*NL*
and
every
moment
he
encountered
some
new
phase
of
it
.
On
reaching
the
*NL*
landing-place
,
he
leaned
his
back
against
the
balusters
and
folded
his
*NL*
arms
.
All
at
once
he
opened
his
coat
,
drew
out
his
pocket-book
,
took
*NL*
from
it
a
pencil
,
tore
out
a
leaf
,
and
upon
that
leaf
he
wrote
rapidly
,
*NL*
by
the
light
of
the
street
lantern
,
this
line
:
M.
Madeleine
,
Mayor
of
M.
*NL*
sur
M.
;
then
he
ascended
the
stairs
once
more
with
great
strides
,
made
*NL*
his
way
through
the
crowd
,
walked
straight
up
to
the
usher
,
handed
him
*NL*
the
paper
,
and
said
in
an
authoritative
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
this
to
Monsieur
le
President
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
took
the
paper
,
cast
a
glance
upon
it
,
and
obeyed
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
AN
ENTRANCE
BY
FAVOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Although
he
did
not
suspect
the
fact
,
the
mayor
of
M.
sur
M.
enjoyed
*NL*
a
sort
of
celebrity
.
For
the
space
of
seven
years
his
reputation
for
*NL*
virtue
had
filled
the
whole
of
Bas
Boulonnais
;
it
had
eventually
passed
*NL*
the
confines
of
a
small
district
and
had
been
spread
abroad
through
*NL*
two
or
three
neighboring
departments
.
Besides
the
service
which
he
had
*NL*
rendered
to
the
chief
town
by
resuscitating
the
black
jet
industry
,
*NL*
there
was
not
one
out
of
the
hundred
and
forty
communes
of
the
*NL*
arrondissement
of
M.
sur
M.
which
was
not
indebted
to
him
for
some
*NL*
benefit
.
He
had
even
at
need
contrived
to
aid
and
multiply
the
*NL*
industries
of
other
arrondissements
.
It
was
thus
that
he
had
,
when
*NL*
occasion
offered
,
supported
with
his
credit
and
his
funds
the
linen
*NL*
factory
at
Boulogne
,
the
flax-spinning
industry
at
Frevent
,
and
the
*NL*
hydraulic
manufacture
of
cloth
at
Boubers-sur-Canche
.
Everywhere
the
*NL*
name
of
M.
Madeleine
was
pronounced
with
veneration
.
Arras
and
Douai
*NL*
envied
the
happy
little
town
of
M.
sur
M.
its
mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Councillor
of
the
Royal
Court
of
Douai
,
who
was
presiding
over
this
*NL*
session
of
the
Assizes
at
Arras
,
was
acquainted
,
in
common
with
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
world
,
with
this
name
which
was
so
profoundly
and
universally
*NL*
honored
.
When
the
usher
,
discreetly
opening
the
door
which
connected
*NL*
the
council-chamber
with
the
court-room
,
bent
over
the
back
of
the
*NL*
President
's
arm-chair
and
handed
him
the
paper
on
which
was
inscribed
*NL*
the
line
which
we
have
just
perused
,
adding
:
``
The
gentleman
desires
to
*NL*
be
present
at
the
trial
,
''
the
President
,
with
a
quick
and
deferential
*NL*
movement
,
seized
a
pen
and
wrote
a
few
words
at
the
bottom
of
the
paper
*NL*
and
returned
it
to
the
usher
,
saying
,
``
Admit
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
man
whose
history
we
are
relating
had
remained
near
the
door
*NL*
of
the
hall
,
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
attitude
in
which
the
usher
*NL*
had
left
him
.
In
the
midst
of
his
revery
he
heard
some
one
saying
to
*NL*
him
,
``
Will
Monsieur
do
me
the
honor
to
follow
me
?
''
It
was
the
same
usher
*NL*
who
had
turned
his
back
upon
him
but
a
moment
previously
,
and
who
was
*NL*
now
bowing
to
the
earth
before
him
.
At
the
same
time
,
the
usher
handed
*NL*
him
the
paper
.
He
unfolded
it
,
and
as
he
chanced
to
be
near
the
light
,
*NL*
he
could
read
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
President
of
the
Court
of
Assizes
presents
his
respects
to
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
crushed
the
paper
in
his
hand
as
though
those
words
contained
for
him
*NL*
a
strange
and
bitter
aftertaste
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
the
usher
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
he
found
himself
alone
in
a
sort
of
wainscoted
*NL*
cabinet
of
severe
aspect
,
lighted
by
two
wax
candles
,
placed
upon
a
*NL*
table
with
a
green
cloth
.
The
last
words
of
the
usher
who
had
just
*NL*
quitted
him
still
rang
in
his
ears
:
``
Monsieur
,
you
are
now
in
the
*NL*
council-chamber
;
you
have
only
to
turn
the
copper
handle
of
yonder
door
,
*NL*
and
you
will
find
yourself
in
the
court-room
,
behind
the
President
's
*NL*
chair
.
''
These
words
were
mingled
in
his
thoughts
with
a
vague
memory
of
*NL*
narrow
corridors
and
dark
staircases
which
he
had
recently
traversed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
had
left
him
alone
.
The
supreme
moment
had
arrived
.
He
sought
*NL*
to
collect
his
faculties
,
but
could
not
.
It
is
chiefly
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
there
is
the
greatest
need
for
attaching
them
to
the
painful
*NL*
realities
of
life
,
that
the
threads
of
thought
snap
within
the
brain
.
He
*NL*
was
in
the
very
place
where
the
judges
deliberated
and
condemned
.
With
*NL*
stupid
tranquillity
he
surveyed
this
peaceful
and
terrible
apartment
,
*NL*
where
so
many
lives
had
been
broken
,
which
was
soon
to
ring
with
his
*NL*
name
,
and
which
his
fate
was
at
that
moment
traversing
.
He
stared
at
*NL*
the
wall
,
then
he
looked
at
himself
,
wondering
that
it
should
be
that
*NL*
chamber
and
that
it
should
be
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
eaten
nothing
for
four
and
twenty
hours
;
he
was
worn
out
by
the
*NL*
jolts
of
the
cart
,
but
he
was
not
conscious
of
it
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
he
felt
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
a
black
frame
which
was
suspended
on
the
wall
,
and
which
*NL*
contained
,
under
glass
,
an
ancient
autograph
letter
of
Jean
Nicolas
*NL*
Pache
,
mayor
of
Paris
and
minister
,
and
dated
,
through
an
error
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
the
9th
of
June
,
of
the
year
II.
,
and
in
which
Pache
forwarded
to
*NL*
the
commune
the
list
of
ministers
and
deputies
held
in
arrest
by
them
.
*NL*
Any
spectator
who
had
chanced
to
see
him
at
that
moment
,
and
who
had
*NL*
watched
him
,
would
have
imagined
,
doubtless
,
that
this
letter
struck
him
*NL*
as
very
curious
,
for
he
did
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
,
and
he
read
it
*NL*
two
or
three
times
.
He
read
it
without
paying
any
attention
to
it
,
and
*NL*
unconsciously
.
He
was
thinking
of
Fantine
and
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
dreamed
,
he
turned
round
,
and
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
brass
knob
*NL*
of
the
door
which
separated
him
from
the
Court
of
Assizes
.
He
had
almost
*NL*
forgotten
that
door
.
His
glance
,
calm
at
first
,
paused
there
,
remained
*NL*
fixed
on
that
brass
handle
,
then
grew
terrified
,
and
little
by
little
*NL*
became
impregnated
with
fear
.
Beads
of
perspiration
burst
forth
among
*NL*
his
hair
and
trickled
down
upon
his
temples
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
certain
moment
he
made
that
indescribable
gesture
of
a
sort
of
*NL*
authority
mingled
with
rebellion
,
which
is
intended
to
convey
,
and
which
*NL*
does
so
well
convey
,
``
Pardieu
!
who
compels
me
to
this
?
''
Then
he
wheeled
*NL*
briskly
round
,
caught
sight
of
the
door
through
which
he
had
entered
in
*NL*
front
of
him
,
went
to
it
,
opened
it
,
and
passed
out
.
He
was
no
longer
*NL*
in
that
chamber
;
he
was
outside
in
a
corridor
,
a
long
,
narrow
corridor
,
*NL*
broken
by
steps
and
gratings
,
making
all
sorts
of
angles
,
lighted
*NL*
here
and
there
by
lanterns
similar
to
the
night
taper
of
invalids
,
the
*NL*
corridor
through
which
he
had
approached
.
He
breathed
,
he
listened
;
not
*NL*
a
sound
in
front
,
not
a
sound
behind
him
,
and
he
fled
as
though
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
turned
many
angles
in
this
corridor
,
he
still
listened
.
The
*NL*
same
silence
reigned
,
and
there
was
the
same
darkness
around
him
.
He
was
*NL*
out
of
breath
;
he
staggered
;
he
leaned
against
the
wall
.
The
stone
was
*NL*
cold
;
the
perspiration
lay
ice-cold
on
his
brow
;
he
straightened
himself
*NL*
up
with
a
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
there
alone
in
the
darkness
,
trembling
with
cold
and
with
*NL*
something
else
,
too
,
perchance
,
he
meditated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
meditated
all
night
long
;
he
had
meditated
all
the
day
:
he
heard
*NL*
within
him
but
one
voice
,
which
said
,
``
Alas
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
thus
.
At
length
he
bowed
his
head
,
sighed
*NL*
with
agony
,
dropped
his
arms
,
and
retraced
his
steps
.
He
walked
slowly
,
*NL*
and
as
though
crushed
.
It
seemed
as
though
some
one
had
overtaken
him
in
*NL*
his
flight
and
was
leading
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
re-entered
the
council-chamber
.
The
first
thing
he
caught
sight
of
*NL*
was
the
knob
of
the
door
.
This
knob
,
which
was
round
and
of
polished
*NL*
brass
,
shone
like
a
terrible
star
for
him
.
He
gazed
at
it
as
a
lamb
*NL*
might
gaze
into
the
eye
of
a
tiger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
take
his
eyes
from
it
.
From
time
to
time
he
advanced
a
step
*NL*
and
approached
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
listened
,
he
would
have
heard
the
sound
of
the
adjoining
hall
*NL*
like
a
sort
of
confused
murmur
;
but
he
did
not
listen
,
and
he
did
not
*NL*
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
without
himself
knowing
how
it
happened
,
he
found
himself
near
*NL*
the
door
;
he
grasped
the
knob
convulsively
;
the
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
the
court-room
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
A
PLACE
WHERE
CONVICTIONS
ARE
IN
PROCESS
OF
FORMATION
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
a
pace
,
closed
the
door
mechanically
behind
him
,
and
*NL*
remained
standing
,
contemplating
what
he
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
vast
and
badly
lighted
apartment
,
now
full
of
uproar
,
now
full
*NL*
of
silence
,
where
all
the
apparatus
of
a
criminal
case
,
with
its
petty
*NL*
and
mournful
gravity
in
the
midst
of
the
throng
,
was
in
process
of
*NL*
development
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
one
end
of
the
hall
,
the
one
where
he
was
,
were
judges
,
with
*NL*
abstracted
air
,
in
threadbare
robes
,
who
were
gnawing
their
nails
or
*NL*
closing
their
eyelids
;
at
the
other
end
,
a
ragged
crowd
;
lawyers
in
*NL*
all
sorts
of
attitudes
;
soldiers
with
hard
but
honest
faces
;
ancient
,
*NL*
spotted
woodwork
,
a
dirty
ceiling
,
tables
covered
with
serge
that
was
*NL*
yellow
rather
than
green
;
doors
blackened
by
handmarks
;
tap-room
*NL*
lamps
which
emitted
more
smoke
than
light
,
suspended
from
nails
in
*NL*
the
wainscot
;
on
the
tables
candles
in
brass
candlesticks
;
darkness
,
*NL*
ugliness
,
sadness
;
and
from
all
this
there
was
disengaged
an
austere
and
*NL*
august
impression
,
for
one
there
felt
that
grand
human
thing
which
is
*NL*
called
the
law
,
and
that
grand
divine
thing
which
is
called
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
in
all
that
throng
paid
any
attention
to
him
;
all
glances
were
*NL*
directed
towards
a
single
point
,
a
wooden
bench
placed
against
a
small
*NL*
door
,
in
the
stretch
of
wall
on
the
President
's
left
;
on
this
bench
,
*NL*
illuminated
by
several
candles
,
sat
a
man
between
two
gendarmes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
seek
him
;
he
saw
him
;
his
eyes
went
thither
naturally
,
as
*NL*
though
they
had
known
beforehand
where
that
figure
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
was
looking
at
himself
,
grown
old
;
not
absolutely
the
same
*NL*
in
face
,
of
course
,
but
exactly
similar
in
attitude
and
aspect
,
with
his
*NL*
bristling
hair
,
with
that
wild
and
uneasy
eye
,
with
that
blouse
,
just
as
*NL*
it
was
on
the
day
when
he
entered
D
--
,
full
of
hatred
,
concealing
*NL*
his
soul
in
that
hideous
mass
of
frightful
thoughts
which
he
had
spent
*NL*
nineteen
years
in
collecting
on
the
floor
of
the
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
with
a
shudder
,
``
Good
God
!
shall
I
become
like
that
*NL*
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
creature
seemed
to
be
at
least
sixty
;
there
was
something
*NL*
indescribably
coarse
,
stupid
,
and
frightened
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
made
by
the
opening
door
,
people
had
drawn
aside
to
make
*NL*
way
for
him
;
the
President
had
turned
his
head
,
and
,
understanding
that
*NL*
the
personage
who
had
just
entered
was
the
mayor
of
M.
sur
M.
,
he
had
*NL*
bowed
to
him
;
the
attorney-general
,
who
had
seen
M.
Madeleine
at
M.
*NL*
sur
M.
,
whither
the
duties
of
his
office
had
called
him
more
than
once
,
*NL*
recognized
him
and
saluted
him
also
:
he
had
hardly
perceived
it
;
he
was
*NL*
the
victim
of
a
sort
of
hallucination
;
he
was
watching
.

,
clerks
,
gendarmes
,
a
throng
of
cruelly
curious
heads
,
all
these
*NL*
he
had
already
beheld
once
,
in
days
gone
by
,
twenty-seven
years
before
;
*NL*
he
had
encountered
those
fatal
things
once
more
;
there
they
were
;
they
*NL*
moved
;
they
existed
;
it
was
no
longer
an
effort
of
his
memory
,
a
mirage
*NL*
of
his
thought
;
they
were
real
gendarmes
and
real
judges
,
a
real
*NL*
crowd
,
and
real
men
of
flesh
and
blood
:
it
was
all
over
;
he
beheld
the
*NL*
monstrous
aspects
of
his
past
reappear
and
live
once
more
around
him
,
*NL*
with
all
that
there
is
formidable
in
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
yawning
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
horrified
by
it
;
he
shut
his
eyes
,
and
exclaimed
in
the
deepest
*NL*
recesses
of
his
soul
,
``
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
by
a
tragic
play
of
destiny
which
made
all
his
ideas
tremble
,
and
*NL*
rendered
him
nearly
mad
,
it
was
another
self
of
his
that
was
there
!
all
*NL*
called
that
man
who
was
being
tried
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
his
very
eyes
,
unheard-of
vision
,
he
had
a
sort
of
representation
*NL*
of
the
most
horrible
moment
of
his
life
,
enacted
by
his
spectre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
there
;
the
apparatus
was
the
same
,
the
hour
of
the
night
,
*NL*
the
faces
of
the
judges
,
of
soldiers
,
and
of
spectators
;
all
were
the
*NL*
same
,
only
above
the
President
's
head
there
hung
a
crucifix
,
something
*NL*
which
the
courts
had
lacked
at
the
time
of
his
condemnation
:
God
had
*NL*
been
absent
when
he
had
been
judged
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
chair
behind
him
;
he
dropped
into
it
,
terrified
at
the
*NL*
thought
that
he
might
be
seen
;
when
he
was
seated
,
he
took
advantage
of
*NL*
a
pile
of
cardboard
boxes
,
which
stood
on
the
judge
's
desk
,
to
conceal
*NL*
his
face
from
the
whole
room
;
he
could
now
see
without
being
seen
;
he
*NL*
had
fully
regained
consciousness
of
the
reality
of
things
;
gradually
he
*NL*
recovered
;
he
attained
that
phase
of
composure
where
it
is
possible
to
*NL*
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Bamatabois
was
one
of
the
jurors
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
for
Javert
,
but
did
not
see
him
;
the
seat
of
the
witnesses
was
*NL*
hidden
from
him
by
the
clerk
's
table
,
and
then
,
as
we
have
just
said
,
*NL*
the
hall
was
sparely
lighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
of
this
entrance
,
the
defendant
's
lawyer
had
just
finished
*NL*
his
plea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attention
of
all
was
excited
to
the
highest
pitch
;
the
affair
had
*NL*
lasted
for
three
hours
:
for
three
hours
that
crowd
had
been
watching
a
*NL*
strange
man
,
a
miserable
specimen
of
humanity
,
either
profoundly
stupid
*NL*
or
profoundly
subtle
,
gradually
bending
beneath
the
weight
of
a
terrible
*NL*
likeness
.
This
man
,
as
the
reader
already
knows
,
was
a
vagabond
who
had
*NL*
been
found
in
a
field
carrying
a
branch
laden
with
ripe
apples
,
broken
*NL*
in
the
orchard
of
a
neighbor
,
called
the
Pierron
orchard
.
Who
was
this
*NL*
man
?
an
examination
had
been
made
;
witnesses
had
been
heard
,
and
they
*NL*
were
unanimous
;
light
had
abounded
throughout
the
entire
debate
;
the
*NL*
accusation
said
:
``
We
have
in
our
grasp
not
only
a
marauder
,
a
stealer
*NL*
of
fruit
;
we
have
here
,
in
our
hands
,
a
bandit
,
an
old
offender
who
*NL*
has
broken
his
ban
,
an
ex-convict
,
a
miscreant
of
the
most
dangerous
*NL*
description
,
a
malefactor
named
Jean
Valjean
,
whom
justice
has
long
been
*NL*
in
search
of
,
and
who
,
eight
years
ago
,
on
emerging
from
the
galleys
*NL*
at
Toulon
,
committed
a
highway
robbery
,
accompanied
by
violence
,
on
the
*NL*
person
of
a
child
,
a
Savoyard
named
Little
Gervais
;
a
crime
provided
*NL*
for
by
article
383
of
the
Penal
Code
,
the
right
to
try
him
for
which
*NL*
we
reserve
hereafter
,
when
his
identity
shall
have
been
judicially
*NL*
established
.
He
has
just
committed
a
fresh
theft
;
it
is
a
case
of
a
*NL*
second
offence
;
condemn
him
for
the
fresh
deed
;
later
on
he
will
be
*NL*
judged
for
the
old
crime
.
''
In
the
face
of
this
accusation
,
in
the
face
*NL*
of
the
unanimity
of
the
witnesses
,
the
accused
appeared
to
be
astonished
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
;
he
made
signs
and
gestures
which
were
meant
to
*NL*
convey
No
,
or
else
he
stared
at
the
ceiling
:
he
spoke
with
difficulty
,
*NL*
replied
with
embarrassment
,
but
his
whole
person
,
from
head
to
foot
,
was
*NL*
a
denial
;
he
was
an
idiot
in
the
presence
of
all
these
minds
ranged
in
*NL*
order
of
battle
around
him
,
and
like
a
stranger
in
the
midst
of
this
*NL*
society
which
was
seizing
fast
upon
him
;
nevertheless
,
it
was
a
question
*NL*
of
the
most
menacing
future
for
him
;
the
likeness
increased
every
*NL*
moment
,
and
the
entire
crowd
surveyed
,
with
more
anxiety
than
he
did
*NL*
himself
,
that
sentence
freighted
with
calamity
,
which
descended
*NL*
ever
closer
over
his
head
;
there
was
even
a
glimpse
of
a
possibility
*NL*
afforded
;
besides
the
galleys
,
a
possible
death
penalty
,
in
case
his
*NL*
identity
were
established
,
and
the
affair
of
Little
Gervais
were
to
end
*NL*
thereafter
in
condemnation
.
Who
was
this
man
?
what
was
the
nature
of
his
*NL*
apathy
?
was
it
imbecility
or
craft
?
Did
he
understand
too
well
,
or
did
*NL*
he
not
understand
at
all
?
these
were
questions
which
divided
the
crowd
,
*NL*
and
seemed
to
divide
the
jury
;
there
was
something
both
terrible
and
*NL*
puzzling
in
this
case
:
the
drama
was
not
only
melancholy
;
it
was
also
*NL*
obscure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
counsel
for
the
defence
had
spoken
tolerably
well
,
in
that
*NL*
provincial
tongue
which
has
long
constituted
the
eloquence
of
the
bar
,
*NL*
and
which
was
formerly
employed
by
all
advocates
,
at
Paris
as
well
as
at
*NL*
Romorantin
or
at
Montbrison
,
and
which
to-day
,
having
become
classic
,
is
*NL*
no
longer
spoken
except
by
the
official
orators
of
magistracy
,
to
whom
*NL*
it
is
suited
on
account
of
its
grave
sonorousness
and
its
majestic
*NL*
stride
;
a
tongue
in
which
a
husband
is
called
a
consort
,
and
a
woman
*NL*
a
spouse
;
Paris
,
the
centre
of
art
and
civilization
;
the
king
,
*NL*
the
monarch
;
Monseigneur
the
Bishop
,
a
sainted
pontiff
;
the
*NL*
district-attorney
,
the
eloquent
interpreter
of
public
prosecution
;
the
*NL*
arguments
,
the
accents
which
we
have
just
listened
to
;
the
age
of
Louis
*NL*
XIV.
,
the
grand
age
;
a
theatre
,
the
temple
of
Melpomene
;
the
reigning
*NL*
family
,
the
august
blood
of
our
kings
;
a
concert
,
a
musical
solemnity
;
*NL*
the
General
Commandant
of
the
province
,
the
illustrious
warrior
,
who
,
*NL*
etc.
;
the
pupils
in
the
seminary
,
these
tender
levities
;
errors
imputed
*NL*
to
newspapers
,
the
imposture
which
distills
its
venom
through
the
*NL*
columns
of
those
organs
;
etc.
.
The
lawyer
had
,
accordingly
,
begun
with
an
*NL*
explanation
as
to
the
theft
of
the
apples
,
--
an
awkward
matter
couched
*NL*
in
fine
style
;
but
Benigne
Bossuet
himself
was
obliged
to
allude
to
a
*NL*
chicken
in
the
midst
of
a
funeral
oration
,
and
he
extricated
himself
*NL*
from
the
situation
in
stately
fashion
.
The
lawyer
established
the
fact
*NL*
that
the
theft
of
the
apples
had
not
been
circumstantially
proved
.
*NL*
His
client
,
whom
he
,
in
his
character
of
counsel
,
persisted
in
calling
*NL*
Champmathieu
,
had
not
been
seen
scaling
that
wall
nor
breaking
that
*NL*
branch
by
any
one
.
He
had
been
taken
with
that
branch
-LRB-
which
the
lawyer
*NL*
preferred
to
call
a
bough
-RRB-
in
his
possession
;
but
he
said
that
he
had
*NL*
found
it
broken
off
and
lying
on
the
ground
,
and
had
picked
it
up
.
*NL*
Where
was
there
any
proof
to
the
contrary
?
No
doubt
that
branch
had
been
*NL*
broken
off
and
concealed
after
the
scaling
of
the
wall
,
then
thrown
away
*NL*
by
the
alarmed
marauder
;
there
was
no
doubt
that
there
had
been
a
*NL*
thief
in
the
case
.
But
what
proof
was
there
that
that
thief
had
been
*NL*
Champmathieu
?
One
thing
only
.
His
character
as
an
ex-convict
.
The
*NL*
lawyer
did
not
deny
that
that
character
appeared
to
be
,
unhappily
,
*NL*
well
attested
;
the
accused
had
resided
at
Faverolles
;
the
accused
had
*NL*
exercised
the
calling
of
a
tree-pruner
there
;
the
name
of
Champmathieu
*NL*
might
well
have
had
its
origin
in
Jean
Mathieu
;
all
that
was
true
,
--
in
*NL*
short
,
four
witnesses
recognize
Champmathieu
,
positively
and
without
*NL*
hesitation
,
as
that
convict
,
Jean
Valjean
;
to
these
signs
,
to
this
*NL*
testimony
,
the
counsel
could
oppose
nothing
but
the
denial
of
his
*NL*
client
,
the
denial
of
an
interested
party
;
but
supposing
that
he
was
*NL*
the
convict
Jean
Valjean
,
did
that
prove
that
he
was
the
thief
of
the
*NL*
apples
?
that
was
a
presumption
at
the
most
,
not
a
proof
.
The
prisoner
,
*NL*
it
was
true
,
and
his
counsel
,
``
in
good
faith
,
''
was
obliged
to
admit
it
,
*NL*
had
adopted
``
a
bad
system
of
defence
.
''
He
obstinately
denied
everything
,
*NL*
the
theft
and
his
character
of
convict
.
An
admission
upon
this
last
*NL*
point
would
certainly
have
been
better
,
and
would
have
won
for
him
the
*NL*
indulgence
of
his
judges
;
the
counsel
had
advised
him
to
do
this
;
but
*NL*
the
accused
had
obstinately
refused
,
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
that
he
would
*NL*
save
everything
by
admitting
nothing
.
It
was
an
error
;
but
ought
not
the
*NL*
paucity
of
this
intelligence
to
be
taken
into
consideration
?
This
man
*NL*
was
visibly
stupid
.
Long-continued
wretchedness
in
the
galleys
,
long
*NL*
misery
outside
the
galleys
,
had
brutalized
him
,
etc.
.
He
defended
himself
*NL*
badly
;
was
that
a
reason
for
condemning
him
?
As
for
the
affair
with
*NL*
Little
Gervais
,
the
counsel
need
not
discuss
it
;
it
did
not
enter
into
*NL*
the
case
.
The
lawyer
wound
up
by
beseeching
the
jury
and
the
court
,
if
*NL*
the
identity
of
Jean
Valjean
appeared
to
them
to
be
evident
,
to
apply
*NL*
to
him
the
police
penalties
which
are
provided
for
a
criminal
who
has
*NL*
broken
his
ban
,
and
not
the
frightful
chastisement
which
descends
upon
*NL*
the
convict
guilty
of
a
second
offence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
district-attorney
answered
the
counsel
for
the
defence
.
He
was
*NL*
violent
and
florid
,
as
district-attorneys
usually
are
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
congratulated
the
counsel
for
the
defence
on
his
``
loyalty
,
''
and
*NL*
skilfully
took
advantage
of
this
loyalty
.
He
reached
the
accused
through
*NL*
all
the
concessions
made
by
his
lawyer
.
The
advocate
had
seemed
to
admit
*NL*
that
the
prisoner
was
Jean
Valjean
.
He
took
note
of
this
.
So
this
man
*NL*
was
Jean
Valjean
.
This
point
had
been
conceded
to
the
accusation
and
*NL*
could
no
longer
be
disputed
.
Here
,
by
means
of
a
clever
*NL*
autonomasia
which
went
back
to
the
sources
and
causes
of
crime
,
the
*NL*
district-attorney
thundered
against
the
immorality
of
the
romantic
*NL*
school
,
then
dawning
under
the
name
of
the
Satanic
school
,
which
*NL*
had
been
bestowed
upon
it
by
the
critics
of
the
Quotidienne
and
the
*NL*
Oriflamme
;
he
attributed
,
not
without
some
probability
,
to
the
influence
*NL*
of
this
perverse
literature
the
crime
of
Champmathieu
,
or
rather
,
*NL*
to
speak
more
correctly
,
of
Jean
Valjean
.
Having
exhausted
these
*NL*
considerations
,
he
passed
on
to
Jean
Valjean
himself
.
Who
was
this
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
?
Description
of
Jean
Valjean
:
a
monster
spewed
forth
,
etc.
.
*NL*
The
model
for
this
sort
of
description
is
contained
in
the
tale
of
*NL*
Theramene
,
which
is
not
useful
to
tragedy
,
but
which
every
day
renders
*NL*
great
services
to
judicial
eloquence
.
The
audience
and
the
jury
*NL*
``
shuddered
.
''
The
description
finished
,
the
district-attorney
resumed
*NL*
with
an
oratorical
turn
calculated
to
raise
the
enthusiasm
of
the
*NL*
journal
of
the
prefecture
to
the
highest
pitch
on
the
following
day
:
And
*NL*
it
is
such
a
man
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
vagabond
,
beggar
,
without
means
of
*NL*
existence
,
etc.
,
etc.
,
inured
by
his
past
life
to
culpable
deeds
,
and
*NL*
but
little
reformed
by
his
sojourn
in
the
galleys
,
as
was
proved
by
the
*NL*
crime
committed
against
Little
Gervais
,
etc.
,
etc.
;
it
is
such
a
man
,
*NL*
caught
upon
the
highway
in
the
very
act
of
theft
,
a
few
paces
from
a
*NL*
wall
that
had
been
scaled
,
still
holding
in
his
hand
the
object
*NL*
stolen
,
who
denies
the
crime
,
the
theft
,
the
climbing
the
wall
;
denies
*NL*
everything
;
denies
even
his
own
identity
!
In
addition
to
a
hundred
*NL*
other
proofs
,
to
which
we
will
not
recur
,
four
witnesses
recognize
*NL*
him
--
Javert
,
the
upright
inspector
of
police
;
Javert
,
and
three
of
*NL*
his
former
companions
in
infamy
,
the
convicts
Brevet
,
Chenildieu
,
and
*NL*
Cochepaille
.
What
does
he
offer
in
opposition
to
this
overwhelming
*NL*
unanimity
?
His
denial
.
What
obduracy
!
You
will
do
justice
,
gentlemen
*NL*
of
the
jury
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
While
the
district-attorney
was
speaking
,
the
*NL*
accused
listened
to
him
open-mouthed
,
with
a
sort
of
amazement
in
which
*NL*
some
admiration
was
assuredly
blended
.
He
was
evidently
surprised
that
*NL*
a
man
could
talk
like
that
.
From
time
to
time
,
at
those
``
energetic
''
*NL*
moments
of
the
prosecutor
's
speech
,
when
eloquence
which
can
not
contain
*NL*
itself
overflows
in
a
flood
of
withering
epithets
and
envelops
the
*NL*
accused
like
a
storm
,
he
moved
his
head
slowly
from
right
to
left
and
*NL*
from
left
to
right
in
the
sort
of
mute
and
melancholy
protest
with
which
*NL*
he
had
contented
himself
since
the
beginning
of
the
argument
.
Two
or
*NL*
three
times
the
spectators
who
were
nearest
to
him
heard
him
say
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
,
``
That
is
what
comes
of
not
having
asked
M.
Baloup
.
''
The
*NL*
district-attorney
directed
the
attention
of
the
jury
to
this
stupid
*NL*
attitude
,
evidently
deliberate
,
which
denoted
not
imbecility
,
but
craft
,
*NL*
skill
,
a
habit
of
deceiving
justice
,
and
which
set
forth
in
all
its
*NL*
nakedness
the
``
profound
perversity
''
of
this
man
.
He
ended
by
making
*NL*
his
reserves
on
the
affair
of
Little
Gervais
and
demanding
a
severe
*NL*
sentence
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
it
was
penal
servitude
for
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
counsel
for
the
defence
rose
,
began
by
complimenting
Monsieur
*NL*
l'Avocat-General
on
his
``
admirable
speech
,
''
then
replied
as
best
he
*NL*
could
;
but
he
weakened
;
the
ground
was
evidently
slipping
away
from
*NL*
under
his
feet

CHAPTER
X
--
THE
SYSTEM
OF
DENIALS
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
for
closing
the
debate
had
arrived
.
The
President
had
the
*NL*
accused
stand
up
,
and
addressed
to
him
the
customary
question
,
``
Have
you
*NL*
anything
to
add
to
your
defence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
did
not
appear
to
understand
,
as
he
stood
there
,
twisting
in
his
*NL*
hands
a
terrible
cap
which
he
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
repeated
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
the
man
heard
it
.
He
seemed
to
understand
.
He
made
a
motion
*NL*
like
a
man
who
is
just
waking
up
,
cast
his
eyes
about
him
,
stared
at
*NL*
the
audience
,
the
gendarmes
,
his
counsel
,
the
jury
,
the
court
,
laid
*NL*
his
monstrous
fist
on
the
rim
of
woodwork
in
front
of
his
bench
,
*NL*
took
another
look
,
and
all
at
once
,
fixing
his
glance
upon
the
*NL*
district-attorney
,
he
began
to
speak
.
It
was
like
an
eruption
.
*NL*
It
seemed
,
from
the
manner
in
which
the
words
escaped
from
his
*NL*
mouth
,
--
incoherent
,
impetuous
,
pell-mell
,
tumbling
over
each
other
,
--
as
*NL*
though
they
were
all
pressing
forward
to
issue
forth
at
once
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
have
to
say
.
That
I
have
been
a
wheelwright
in
Paris
,
*NL*
and
that
it
was
with
Monsieur
Baloup
.
It
is
a
hard
trade
.
In
the
*NL*
wheelwright
's
trade
one
works
always
in
the
open
air
,
in
courtyards
,
*NL*
under
sheds
when
the
masters
are
good
,
never
in
closed
workshops
,
*NL*
because
space
is
required
,
you
see
.
In
winter
one
gets
so
cold
that
one
*NL*
beats
one
's
arms
together
to
warm
one
's
self
;
but
the
masters
do
n't
like
*NL*
it
;
they
say
it
wastes
time
.
Handling
iron
when
there
is
ice
between
*NL*
the
paving-stones
is
hard
work
.
That
wears
a
man
out
quickly
.
One
is
old
*NL*
while
he
is
still
quite
young
in
that
trade
.
At
forty
a
man
is
done
for
.
*NL*
I
was
fifty-three
.
I
was
in
a
bad
state
.
And
then
,
workmen
are
so
mean
!
*NL*
When
a
man
is
no
longer
young
,
they
call
him
nothing
but
an
old
bird
,
*NL*
old
beast
!
I
was
not
earning
more
than
thirty
sous
a
day
.
They
paid
me
*NL*
as
little
as
possible
.
The
masters
took
advantage
of
my
age
--
and
then
I
*NL*
had
my
daughter
,
who
was
a
laundress
at
the
river
.
She
earned
a
little
*NL*
also
.
It
sufficed
for
us
two
.
She
had
trouble
,
also
;
all
day
long
up
to
*NL*
her
waist
in
a
tub
,
in
rain
,
in
snow
.
When
the
wind
cuts
your
face
,
when
*NL*
it
freezes
,
it
is
all
the
same
;
you
must
still
wash
.
There
are
people
*NL*
who
have
not
much
linen
,
and
wait
until
late
;
if
you
do
not
wash
,
you
*NL*
lose
your
custom
.
The
planks
are
badly
joined
,
and
water
drops
on
you
*NL*
from
everywhere
;
you
have
your
petticoats
all
damp
above
and
below
.
That
*NL*
penetrates
.
She
has
also
worked
at
the
laundry
of
the
Enfants-Rouges
,
*NL*
where
the
water
comes
through
faucets
.
You
are
not
in
the
tub
there
;
you
*NL*
wash
at
the
faucet
in
front
of
you
,
and
rinse
in
a
basin
behind
you
.
As
*NL*
it
is
enclosed
,
you
are
not
so
cold
;
but
there
is
that
hot
steam
,
which
*NL*
is
terrible
,
and
which
ruins
your
eyes
.
She
came
home
at
seven
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
evening
,
and
went
to
bed
at
once
,
she
was
so
tired
.
Her
husband
*NL*
beat
her
.
She
is
dead
.
We
have
not
been
very
happy
.
She
was
a
good
girl
,
*NL*
who
did
not
go
to
the
ball
,
and
who
was
very
peaceable
.
I
remember
*NL*
one
Shrove-Tuesday
when
she
went
to
bed
at
eight
o'clock
.
There
,
I
am
*NL*
telling
the
truth
;
you
have
only
to
ask
.
Ah
,
yes
!
how
stupid
I
am
!
Paris
*NL*
is
a
gulf
.
Who
knows
Father
Champmathieu
there
?
But
M.
Baloup
does
,
I
*NL*
tell
you
.
Go
see
at
M.
Baloup
's
;
and
after
all
,
I
do
n't
know
what
is
*NL*
wanted
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
ceased
speaking
,
and
remained
standing
.
He
had
said
these
things
*NL*
in
a
loud
,
rapid
,
hoarse
voice
,
with
a
sort
of
irritated
and
savage
*NL*
ingenuousness
.
Once
he
paused
to
salute
some
one
in
the
crowd
.
The
sort
*NL*
of
affirmations
which
he
seemed
to
fling
out
before
him
at
random
came
*NL*
like
hiccoughs
,
and
to
each
he
added
the
gesture
of
a
wood-cutter
who
is
*NL*
splitting
wood
.
When
he
had
finished
,
the
audience
burst
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
He
stared
at
the
public
,
and
,
perceiving
that
they
were
laughing
,
and
*NL*
not
understanding
why
,
he
began
to
laugh
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
inauspicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
,
an
attentive
and
benevolent
man
,
raised
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reminded
``
the
gentlemen
of
the
jury
''
that
``
the
sieur
Baloup
,
formerly
*NL*
a
master-wheelwright
,
with
whom
the
accused
stated
that
he
had
served
,
*NL*
had
been
summoned
in
vain
.
He
had
become
bankrupt
,
and
was
not
to
be
*NL*
found
.
''
Then
turning
to
the
accused
,
he
enjoined
him
to
listen
to
what
*NL*
he
was
about
to
say
,
and
added
:
``
You
are
in
a
position
where
reflection
*NL*
is
necessary
.
The
gravest
presumptions
rest
upon
you
,
and
may
induce
*NL*
vital
results
.
Prisoner
,
in
your
own
interests
,
I
summon
you
for
the
*NL*
last
time
to
explain
yourself
clearly
on
two
points
.
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
did
you
or
did
you
not
climb
the
wall
of
the
Pierron
orchard
,
break
*NL*
the
branch
,
and
steal
the
apples
;
that
is
to
say
,
commit
the
crime
*NL*
of
breaking
in
and
theft
?
In
the
second
place
,
are
you
the
discharged
*NL*
convict
,
Jean
Valjean
--
yes
or
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
shook
his
head
with
a
capable
air
,
like
a
man
who
has
*NL*
thoroughly
understood
,
and
who
knows
what
answer
he
is
going
to
make
.
He
*NL*
opened
his
mouth
,
turned
towards
the
President
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
stared
at
his
cap
,
stared
at
the
ceiling
,
and
held
his
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prisoner
,
''
said
the
district-attorney
,
in
a
severe
voice
;
``
pay
*NL*
attention
.
You
are
not
answering
anything
that
has
been
asked
of
you
.
*NL*
Your
embarrassment
condemns
you
.
It
is
evident
that
your
name
is
not
*NL*
Champmathieu
;
that
you
are
the
convict
,
Jean
Valjean
,
concealed
first
*NL*
under
the
name
of
Jean
Mathieu
,
which
was
the
name
of
his
mother
;
that
*NL*
you
went
to
Auvergne
;
that
you
were
born
at
Faverolles
,
where
you
were
*NL*
a
pruner
of
trees
.
It
is
evident
that
you
have
been
guilty
of
entering
,
*NL*
and
of
the
theft
of
ripe
apples
from
the
Pierron
orchard
.
The
gentlemen
*NL*
of
the
jury
will
form
their
own
opinion

The
prisoner
had
finally
resumed
his
seat
;
he
arose
abruptly
when
the
*NL*
district-attorney
had
finished
,
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
wicked
;
that
you
are
!
This
what
I
wanted
to
say
;
I
could
*NL*
not
find
words
for
it
at
first
.
I
have
stolen
nothing
.
I
am
a
man
who
*NL*
does
not
have
something
to
eat
every
day
.
I
was
coming
from
Ailly
;
I
*NL*
was
walking
through
the
country
after
a
shower
,
which
had
made
the
whole
*NL*
country
yellow
:
even
the
ponds
were
overflowed
,
and
nothing
sprang
from
*NL*
the
sand
any
more
but
the
little
blades
of
grass
at
the
wayside
.
I
*NL*
found
a
broken
branch
with
apples
on
the
ground
;
I
picked
up
the
branch
*NL*
without
knowing
that
it
would
get
me
into
trouble
.
I
have
been
in
*NL*
prison
,
and
they
have
been
dragging
me
about
for
the
last
three
months
;
*NL*
more
than
that
I
can
not
say
;
people
talk
against
me
,
they
tell
me
,
*NL*
`
Answer
!
'
The
gendarme
,
who
is
a
good
fellow
,
nudges
my
elbow
,
and
says
*NL*
to
me
in
a
low
voice
,
`
Come
,
answer
!
'
I
do
n't
know
how
to
explain
;
I
*NL*
have
no
education
;
I
am
a
poor
man
;
that
is
where
they
wrong
me
,
because
*NL*
they
do
not
see
this
.
I
have
not
stolen
;
I
picked
up
from
the
ground
*NL*
things
that
were
lying
there
.
You
say
,
Jean
Valjean
,
Jean
Mathieu
!
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
those
persons
;
they
are
villagers
.
I
worked
for
M.
Baloup
,
*NL*
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
;
my
name
is
Champmathieu
.
You
are
very
clever
to
*NL*
tell
me
where
I
was
born
;
I
do
n't
know
myself
:
it
's
not
everybody
*NL*
who
has
a
house
in
which
to
come
into
the
world
;
that
would
be
too
*NL*
convenient
.
I
think
that
my
father
and
mother
were
people
who
strolled
*NL*
along
the
highways
;
I
know
nothing
different
.
When
I
was
a
child
,
*NL*
they
called
me
young
fellow
;
now
they
call
me
old
fellow
;
those
are
my
*NL*
baptismal
names
;
take
that
as
you
like
.
I
have
been
in
Auvergne
;
I
have
*NL*
been
at
Faverolles

Pardi

Well
!
ca
n't
a
man
have
been
in
Auvergne
,
or
*NL*
at
Faverolles
,
without
having
been
in
the
galleys
?
I
tell
you
that
I
*NL*
have
not
stolen
,
and
that
I
am
Father
Champmathieu
;
I
have
been
with
M.
*NL*
Baloup
;
I
have
had
a
settled
residence
.
You
worry
me
with
your
nonsense
,
*NL*
there
!
Why
is
everybody
pursuing
me
so
furiously
?

*NL*
The
district-attorney
had
remained
standing
;
he
addressed
the
*NL*
President
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
President

in
view
of
the
confused
but
exceedingly
clever

denials
of
the
prisoner

would
like
to
pass
himself
off
as
an
idiot

who
will
not
succeed
in
so
doing

shall
attend

demand

Brevet

Cochepaille

question
them
for

time

the
identity

the
convict
Jean
Valjean

*NL*
``
I
would
remind
the

said
the

``
that

neighboring
arrondissement

left
the
court-room

the
town
as
soon
as

he
had
made
his
deposition

we
have
accorded
him
permission

with
the
*NL*
consent
of
the
district-attorney

of
the
counsel
for
the
prisoner

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

responded
the
district-attorney

``
In
the
*NL*
absence
of
sieur
Javert

I
think
it
my
duty
to
remind
the
gentlemen
of
*NL*
the
jury
of
what
he
said
here
a
few
hours
ago
.
Javert
is
an
estimable
*NL*
man
,
who
does
honor
by
his
rigorous
and
strict
probity
to
inferior
but
*NL*
important
functions
.
These
are
the
terms
of
his
deposition

I
do
not
*NL*
even
stand
in
need
of
circumstantial
proofs
and
moral
presumptions
to
*NL*
give
the
lie
to
the
prisoner
's
denial

I
recognize
him
perfectly

The
*NL*
name
of
this
man
is
not
Champmathieu
;
he
is
an
ex-convict
named
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
and
is
very
vicious
and
much
to
be
feared
.
It
is
only
with
*NL*
extreme
regret
that
he
was
released
at
the
expiration
of
his
term
.
He
*NL*
underwent
nineteen
years
of
penal
servitude
for
theft
.
He
made
five
or
*NL*
six
attempts
to
escape
.
Besides
the
theft
from
Little
Gervais
,
and
from
*NL*
the
Pierron
orchard
,
I
suspect
him
of
a
theft
committed
in
the
house
of
*NL*
His
Grace
the
late
Bishop
of
D

I
often
saw
him
at
the
time
when
I

was
adjutant

statement
appeared
to
produce
a
vivid
impression
*NL*
on
the
public
and
on
the
jury
.
The
district-attorney
concluded
by
*NL*
insisting
,
that
in
default
of
Javert
,
the
three
witnesses
Brevet
,
*NL*
Chenildieu
,
and
Cochepaille
should
be
heard
once
more
and
solemnly
*NL*
interrogated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
transmitted
the
order
to
an
usher
,
and
,
a
moment
later
,
*NL*
the
door
of
the
witnesses
'
room
opened
.
The
usher
,
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
gendarme
ready
to
lend
him
armed
assistance
,
introduced
the
convict
*NL*
Brevet
.
The
audience
was
in
suspense
;
and
all
breasts
heaved
as
though
*NL*
they
had
contained
but
one
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ex-convict
Brevet
wore
the
black
and
gray
waistcoat
of
the
central
*NL*
prisons
.
Brevet
was
a
person
sixty
years
of
age
,
who
had
a
sort
of
*NL*
business
man
's
face
,
and
the
air
of
a
rascal
.
The
two
sometimes
go
*NL*
together
.
In
prison
,
whither
fresh
misdeeds
had
led
him
,
he
had
become
*NL*
something
in
the
nature
of
a
turnkey
.
He
was
a
man
of
whom
his
superiors
*NL*
said
,
``
He
tries
to
make
himself
of
use
.
''
The
chaplains
bore
good
*NL*
testimony
as
to
his
religious
habits
.
It
must
not
be
forgotten
that
this
*NL*
passed
under
the
Restoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brevet
,
''
said
the
President
,
``
you
have
undergone
an
ignominious
*NL*
sentence
,
and
you
can
not
take
an
oath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Brevet
dropped
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
continued
the
President
,
``
even
in
the
man
whom
the
law
*NL*
has
degraded
,
there
may
remain
,
when
the
divine
mercy
permits
it
,
a
*NL*
sentiment
of
honor
and
of
equity
.
It
is
to
this
sentiment
that
I
*NL*
appeal
at
this
decisive
hour
.
If
it
still
exists
in
you
,
--
and
I
hope
*NL*
it
does
,
--
reflect
before
replying
to
me
:
consider
on
the
one
hand
,
this
*NL*
man
,
whom
a
word
from
you
may
ruin
;
on
the
other
hand
,
justice
,
which
a
*NL*
word
from
you
may
enlighten
.
The
instant
is
solemn
;
there
is
still
time
*NL*
to
retract
if
you
think
you
have
been
mistaken
.
Rise
,
prisoner
.
Brevet
,
*NL*
take
a
good
look
at
the
accused
,
recall
your
souvenirs
,
and
tell
us
on
*NL*
your
soul
and
conscience
,
if
you
persist
in
recognizing
this
man
as
your
*NL*
former
companion
in
the
galleys
,
Jean
Valjean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Brevet
looked
at
the
prisoner
,
then
turned
towards
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mr.
President
,
I
was
the
first
to
recognize
him
,
and
I
stick
to
*NL*
it
;
that
man
is
Jean
Valjean
,
who
entered
at
Toulon
in
1796
,
and
left
in
*NL*
1815
.
I
left
a
year
later
.
He
has
the
air
of
a
brute
now
;
but
it
must
be
*NL*
because
age
has
brutalized
him
;
he
was
sly
at
the
galleys
:
I
recognize
*NL*
him
positively
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
your
seat
,
''
said
the
President
.
``
Prisoner
,
remain
standing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Chenildieu
was
brought
in
,
a
prisoner
for
life
,
as
was
indicated
by
his
*NL*
red
cassock
and
his
green
cap
.
He
was
serving
out
his
sentence
at
the
*NL*
galleys
of
Toulon
,
whence
he
had
been
brought
for
this
case
.
He
was
a
*NL*
small
man
of
about
fifty
,
brisk
,
wrinkled
,
frail
,
yellow
,
brazen-faced
,
*NL*
feverish
,
who
had
a
sort
of
sickly
feebleness
about
all
his
limbs
and
*NL*
his
whole
person
,
and
an
immense
force
in
his
glance
.
His
companions
in
*NL*
the
galleys
had
nicknamed
him
I-deny-God
-LRB-
Je-nie
Dieu
,
Chenildieu
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
addressed
him
in
nearly
the
same
words
which
he
had
*NL*
used
to
Brevet
.
At
the
moment
when
he
reminded
him
of
his
infamy
which
*NL*
deprived
him
of
the
right
to
take
an
oath
,
Chenildieu
raised
his
*NL*
head
and
looked
the
crowd
in
the
face
.
The
President
invited
him
to
*NL*
reflection
,
and
asked
him
as
he
had
asked
Brevet
,
if
he
persisted
in
*NL*
recognition
of
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chenildieu
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
,
as
if
I
did
n't
recognize
him
!
We
were
attached
to
the
same
*NL*
chain
for
five
years
.
So
you
are
sulking
,
old
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
take
your
seat
,
''
said
the
President
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usher
brought
in
Cochepaille
.
He
was
another
convict
for
life
,
who
*NL*
had
come
from
the
galleys
,
and
was
dressed
in
red
,
like
Chenildieu
,
was
*NL*
a
peasant
from
Lourdes
,
and
a
half-bear
of
the
Pyrenees
.
He
had
guarded
*NL*
the
flocks
among
the
mountains
,
and
from
a
shepherd
he
had
slipped
into
*NL*
a
brigand
.
Cochepaille
was
no
less
savage
and
seemed
even
more
stupid
*NL*
than
the
prisoner
.
He
was
one
of
those
wretched
men
whom
nature
has
*NL*
sketched
out
for
wild
beasts
,
and
on
whom
society
puts
the
finishing
*NL*
touches
as
convicts
in
the
galleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
tried
to
touch
him
with
some
grave
and
pathetic
words
,
*NL*
and
asked
him
,
as
he
had
asked
the
other
two
,
if
he
persisted
,
without
*NL*
hesitation
or
trouble
,
in
recognizing
the
man
who
was
standing
before
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
Jean
Valjean
,
''
said
Cochepaille
.
``
He
was
even
called
*NL*
Jean-the-Screw
,
because
he
was
so
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
of
these
affirmations
from
these
three
men
,
evidently
sincere
and
*NL*
in
good
faith
,
had
raised
in
the
audience
a
murmur
of
bad
augury
for
the
*NL*
prisoner
,
--
a
murmur
which
increased
and
lasted
longer
each
time
that
a
*NL*
fresh
declaration
was
added
to
the
proceeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
had
listened
to
them
,
with
that
astounded
face
which
was
,
*NL*
according
to
the
accusation
,
his
principal
means
of
defence
;
at
the
*NL*
first
,
the
gendarmes
,
his
neighbors
,
had
heard
him
mutter
between
his
*NL*
teeth
:
``
Ah
,
well
,
he
's
a
nice
one
!
''
after
the
second
,
he
said
,
a
little
*NL*
louder
,
with
an
air
that
was
almost
that
of
satisfaction
,
``
Good
!
''
at
the
*NL*
third
,
he
cried
,
``
Famous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
President
addressed
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
,
prisoner
?
What
have
you
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
`
Famous
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
uproar
broke
out
among
the
audience
,
and
was
communicated
to
the
*NL*
jury
;
it
was
evident
that
the
man
was
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ushers
,
''
said
the
President
,
``
enforce
silence
!
I
am
going
to
sum
up
the
*NL*
arguments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
there
was
a
movement
just
beside
the
President
;
a
voice
*NL*
was
heard
crying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brevet
!
Chenildieu
!
Cochepaille
!
look
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
who
heard
that
voice
were
chilled
,
so
lamentable
and
terrible
was
*NL*
it
;
all
eyes
were
turned
to
the
point
whence
it
had
proceeded
.
A
man
,
*NL*
placed
among
the
privileged
spectators
who
were
seated
behind
the
*NL*
court
,
had
just
risen
,
had
pushed
open
the
half-door
which
separated
the
*NL*
tribunal
from
the
audience
,
and
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
;
*NL*
the
President
,
the
district-attorney
,
M.
Bamatabois
,
twenty
persons
,
*NL*
recognized
him
,
and
exclaimed
in
concert
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Madeleine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XI
--
CHAMPMATHIEU
MORE
AND
MORE
ASTONISHED
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
he
,
in
fact
.
The
clerk
's
lamp
illumined
his
countenance
.
He
held
*NL*
his
hat
in
his
hand
;
there
was
no
disorder
in
his
clothing
;
his
coat
*NL*
was
carefully
buttoned
;
he
was
very
pale
,
and
he
trembled
slightly
;
*NL*
his
hair
,
which
had
still
been
gray
on
his
arrival
in
Arras
,
was
now
*NL*
entirely
white
:
it
had
turned
white
during
the
hour
he
had
sat
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
heads
were
raised
:
the
sensation
was
indescribable
;
there
was
*NL*
a
momentary
hesitation
in
the
audience
,
the
voice
had
been
so
*NL*
heart-rending
;
the
man
who
stood
there
appeared
so
calm
that
they
did
*NL*
not
understand
at
first
.
They
asked
themselves
whether
he
had
indeed
*NL*
uttered
that
cry
;
they
could
not
believe
that
that
tranquil
man
had
been
*NL*
the
one
to
give
that
terrible
outcry
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
indecision
only
lasted
a
few
seconds
.
Even
before
the
President
*NL*
and
the
district-attorney
could
utter
a
word
,
before
the
ushers
and
the
*NL*
gendarmes
could
make
a
gesture
,
the
man
whom
all
still
called
,
at
that
*NL*
moment
,
M.
Madeleine
,
had
advanced
towards
the
witnesses
Cochepaille
,
*NL*
Brevet
,
and
Chenildieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
not
recognize
me
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
remained
speechless
,
and
indicated
by
a
sign
of
the
head
that
*NL*
they
did
not
know
him
.
Cochepaille
,
who
was
intimidated
,
made
a
military
*NL*
salute
.
M.
Madeleine
turned
towards
the
jury
and
the
court
,
and
said
in
*NL*
a
gentle
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
order
the
prisoner
to
be
released
!
Mr.
*NL*
President
,
have
me
arrested
.
He
is
not
the
man
whom
you
are
in
search
*NL*
of
;
it
is
I
:
I
am
Jean
Valjean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
mouth
breathed
;
the
first
commotion
of
astonishment
had
been
*NL*
followed
by
a
silence
like
that
of
the
grave
;
those
within
the
hall
*NL*
experienced
that
sort
of
religious
terror
which
seizes
the
masses
when
*NL*
something
grand
has
been
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
face
of
the
President
was
stamped
with
sympathy
and
*NL*
sadness
;
he
had
exchanged
a
rapid
sign
with
the
district-attorney
and
a
*NL*
few
low-toned
words
with
the
assistant
judges
;
he
addressed
the
public
,
*NL*
and
asked
in
accents
which
all
understood
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
physician
present
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
district-attorney
took
the
word
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
of
the
jury
,
the
very
strange
and
unexpected
incident
*NL*
which
disturbs
the
audience
inspires
us
,
like
yourselves
,
only
with
a
*NL*
sentiment
which
it
is
unnecessary
for
us
to
express
.
You
all
know
,
by
*NL*
reputation
at
least
,
the
honorable
M.
Madeleine
,
mayor
of
M.
sur
M.
;
*NL*
if
there
is
a
physician
in
the
audience
,
we
join
the
President
in
*NL*
requesting
him
to
attend
to
M.
Madeleine
,
and
to
conduct
him
to
his
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
did
not
allow
the
district-attorney
to
finish
;
he
*NL*
interrupted
him
in
accents
full
of
suavity
and
authority
.
These
are
the
*NL*
words
which
he
uttered
;
here
they
are
literally
,
as
they
were
written
*NL*
down
,
immediately
after
the
trial
by
one
of
the
witnesses
to
this
scene
,
*NL*
and
as
they
now
ring
in
the
ears
of
those
who
heard
them
nearly
forty
*NL*
years
ago
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
Mr.
District-Attorney
,
but
I
am
not
mad
;
you
shall
see
;
*NL*
you
were
on
the
point
of
committing
a
great
error
;
release
this
man
!
I
*NL*
am
fulfilling
a
duty
;
I
am
that
miserable
criminal
.
I
am
the
only
one
*NL*
here
who
sees
the
matter
clearly
,
and
I
am
telling
you
the
truth
.
God
,
*NL*
who
is
on
high
,
looks
down
on
what
I
am
doing
at
this
moment
,
and
that
*NL*
suffices
.
You
can
take
me
,
for
here
I
am
:
but
I
have
done
my
best
;
I
*NL*
concealed
myself
under
another
name
;
I
have
become
rich
;
I
have
become
*NL*
a
mayor
;
I
have
tried
to
re-enter
the
ranks
of
the
honest
.
It
seems
that
*NL*
that
is
not
to
be
done
.
In
short
,
there
are
many
things
which
I
can
not
*NL*
tell
.
I
will
not
narrate
the
story
of
my
life
to
you
;
you
will
hear
it
*NL*
one
of
these
days
.
I
robbed
Monseigneur
the
Bishop
,
it
is
true
;
it
is
*NL*
true
that
I
robbed
Little
Gervais
;
they
were
right
in
telling
you
that
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
a
very
vicious
wretch
.
Perhaps
it
was
not
altogether
*NL*
his
fault
.
Listen
,
honorable
judges
!
a
man
who
has
been
so
greatly
*NL*
humbled
as
I
have
has
neither
any
remonstrances
to
make
to
Providence
,
*NL*
nor
any
advice
to
give
to
society
;
but
,
you
see
,
the
infamy
from
which
I
*NL*
have
tried
to
escape
is
an
injurious
thing
;
the
galleys
make
the
convict
*NL*
what
he
is
;
reflect
upon
that
,
if
you
please
.
Before
going
to
the
*NL*
galleys
,
I
was
a
poor
peasant
,
with
very
little
intelligence
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
idiot
;
the
galleys
wrought
a
change
in
me
.
I
was
stupid
;
I
became
*NL*
vicious
:
I
was
a
block
of
wood
;
I
became
a
firebrand
.
Later
on
,
*NL*
indulgence
and
kindness
saved
me
,
as
severity
had
ruined
me
.
But
,
pardon
*NL*
me
,
you
can
not
understand
what
I
am
saying
.
You
will
find
at
my
house
,
*NL*
among
the
ashes
in
the
fireplace
,
the
forty-sou
piece
which
I
stole
,
*NL*
seven
years
ago
,
from
little
Gervais
.
I
have
nothing
farther
to
add
;
*NL*
take
me
.
Good
God
!
the
district-attorney
shakes
his
head
;
you
say
,
'M
.
*NL*
Madeleine
has
gone
mad
!
'
you
do
not
believe
me
!
that
is
distressing
.
Do
*NL*
not
,
at
least
,
condemn
this
man
!
What
!
these
men
do
not
recognize
me
!
I
*NL*
wish
Javert
were
here
;
he
would
recognize
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
reproduce
the
sombre
and
kindly
melancholy
of
tone
which
*NL*
accompanied
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
the
three
convicts
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
recognize
you
;
do
you
remember
,
Brevet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
hesitated
for
an
instant
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
the
knitted
suspenders
with
a
checked
pattern
which
you
*NL*
wore
in
the
galleys
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Brevet
gave
a
start
of
surprise
,
and
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
with
*NL*
a
frightened
air
.
He
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chenildieu
,
you
who
conferred
on
yourself
the
name
of
`
Jenie-Dieu
,
'
*NL*
your
whole
right
shoulder
bears
a
deep
burn
,
because
you
one
day
laid
*NL*
your
shoulder
against
the
chafing-dish
full
of
coals
,
in
order
to
efface
*NL*
the
three
letters
T.
F.
P.
,
which
are
still
visible
,
nevertheless
;
*NL*
answer
,
is
this
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
true
,
''
said
Chenildieu
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
addressed
himself
to
Cochepaille
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cochepaille
,
you
have
,
near
the
bend
in
your
left
arm
,
a
date
stamped
*NL*
in
blue
letters
with
burnt
powder
;
the
date
is
that
of
the
landing
of
*NL*
the
Emperor
at
Cannes
,
March
1
,
1815
;
pull
up
your
sleeve
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cochepaille
pushed
up
his
sleeve
;
all
eyes
were
focused
on
him
and
on
*NL*
his
bare
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
gendarme
held
a
light
close
to
it
;
there
was
the
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
man
turned
to
the
spectators
and
the
judges
with
a
smile
*NL*
which
still
rends
the
hearts
of
all
who
saw
it
whenever
they
think
of
*NL*
it
.
It
was
a
smile
of
triumph
;
it
was
also
a
smile
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
plainly
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
I
am
Jean
Valjean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
chamber
there
were
no
longer
either
judges
,
accusers
,
nor
*NL*
gendarmes
;
there
was
nothing
but
staring
eyes
and
sympathizing
hearts
.
*NL*
No
one
recalled
any
longer
the
part
that
each
might
be
called
upon
*NL*
to
play
;
the
district-attorney
forgot
he
was
there
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
prosecuting
,
the
President
that
he
was
there
to
preside
,
the
counsel
for
*NL*
the
defence
that
he
was
there
to
defend
.
It
was
a
striking
circumstance
*NL*
that
no
question
was
put
,
that
no
authority
intervened
.
The
peculiarity
*NL*
of
sublime
spectacles
is
,
that
they
capture
all
souls
and
turn
witnesses
*NL*
into
spectators
.
No
one
,
probably
,
could
have
explained
what
he
felt
;
*NL*
no
one
,
probably
,
said
to
himself
that
he
was
witnessing
the
splendid
*NL*
outburst
of
a
grand
light
:
all
felt
themselves
inwardly
dazzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
they
had
Jean
Valjean
before
their
eyes
.
That
was
*NL*
clear
.
The
appearance
of
this
man
had
sufficed
to
suffuse
with
light
*NL*
that
matter
which
had
been
so
obscure
but
a
moment
previously
,
without
*NL*
any
further
explanation
:
the
whole
crowd
,
as
by
a
sort
of
electric
*NL*
revelation
,
understood
instantly
and
at
a
single
glance
the
simple
*NL*
and
magnificent
history
of
a
man
who
was
delivering
himself
up
so
*NL*
that
another
man
might
not
be
condemned
in
his
stead
.
The
details
,
the
*NL*
hesitations
,
little
possible
oppositions
,
were
swallowed
up
in
that
vast
*NL*
and
luminous
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
impression
which
vanished
speedily
,
but
which
was
irresistible
*NL*
at
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wish
to
disturb
the
court
further
,
''
resumed
Jean
Valjean
.
``
I
*NL*
shall
withdraw
,
since
you
do
not
arrest
me
.
I
have
many
things
to
do
.
*NL*
The
district-attorney
knows
who
I
am
;
he
knows
whither
I
am
going
;
he
*NL*
can
have
me
arrested
when
he
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
directed
his
steps
towards
the
door
.
Not
a
voice
was
raised
,
not
an
*NL*
arm
extended
to
hinder
him
.
All
stood
aside
.
At
that
moment
there
was
*NL*
about
him
that
divine
something
which
causes
multitudes
to
stand
aside
*NL*
and
make
way
for
a
man
.
He
traversed
the
crowd
slowly
.
It
was
never
*NL*
known
who
opened
the
door
,
but
it
is
certain
that
he
found
the
door
open
*NL*
when
he
reached
it
.
On
arriving
there
he
turned
round
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
at
your
command
,
Mr.
District-Attorney
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
addressed
the
audience
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
of
you
,
all
who
are
present
--
consider
me
worthy
of
pity
,
do
you
*NL*
not
?
Good
God
!
When
I
think
of
what
I
was
on
the
point
of
doing
,
I
*NL*
consider
that
I
am
to
be
envied
.
Nevertheless
,
I
should
have
preferred
*NL*
not
to
have
had
this
occur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
withdrew
,
and
the
door
closed
behind
him
as
it
had
opened
,
for
those
*NL*
who
do
certain
sovereign
things
are
always
sure
of
being
served
by
some
*NL*
one
in
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Less
than
an
hour
after
this
,
the
verdict
of
the
jury
freed
the
said
*NL*
Champmathieu
from
all
accusations
;
and
Champmathieu
,
being
at
once
*NL*
released
,
went
off
in
a
state
of
stupefaction
,
thinking
that
all
men
*NL*
were
fools
,
and
comprehending
nothing
of
this
vision
.

CHAPTER
I
--
IN
WHAT
MIRROR
M.
MADELEINE
CONTEMPLATES
HIS
HAIR
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
begun
to
dawn
.
Fantine
had
passed
a
sleepless
and
feverish
*NL*
night
,
filled
with
happy
visions
;
at
daybreak
she
fell
asleep
.
Sister
*NL*
Simplice
,
who
had
been
watching
with
her
,
availed
herself
of
this
*NL*
slumber
to
go
and
prepare
a
new
potion
of
chinchona
.
The
worthy
sister
*NL*
had
been
in
the
laboratory
of
the
infirmary
but
a
few
moments
,
bending
*NL*
over
her
drugs
and
phials
,
and
scrutinizing
things
very
closely
,
on
*NL*
account
of
the
dimness
which
the
half-light
of
dawn
spreads
over
all
*NL*
objects
.
Suddenly
she
raised
her
head
and
uttered
a
faint
shriek
.
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
stood
before
her
;
he
had
just
entered
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
,
Mr.
Mayor
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
that
poor
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
bad
just
now
;
but
we
have
been
very
uneasy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
explained
to
him
what
had
passed
:
that
Fantine
had
been
very
ill
the
*NL*
day
before
,
and
that
she
was
better
now
,
because
she
thought
that
the
*NL*
mayor
had
gone
to
Montfermeil
to
get
her
child
.
The
sister
dared
not
*NL*
question
the
mayor
;
but
she
perceived
plainly
from
his
air
that
he
had
*NL*
not
come
from
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
good
,
''
said
he
;
``
you
were
right
not
to
undeceive
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
responded
the
sister
;
``
but
now
,
Mr.
Mayor
,
she
will
see
you
and
*NL*
will
not
see
her
child
.
What
shall
we
say
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
reflected
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
will
inspire
us
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
can
not
tell
a
lie
,
''
murmured
the
sister
,
half
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
broad
daylight
in
the
room
.
The
light
fell
full
on
M.
Madeleine
's
*NL*
face
.
The
sister
chanced
to
raise
her
eyes
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
sir
!
''
she
exclaimed
;
``
what
has
happened
to
you
?
Your
hair
is
*NL*
perfectly
white
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
White
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Simplice
had
no
mirror
.
She
rummaged
in
a
drawer
,
and
pulled
out
*NL*
the
little
glass
which
the
doctor
of
the
infirmary
used
to
see
whether
*NL*
a
patient
was
dead
and
whether
he
no
longer
breathed
.
M.
Madeleine
took
*NL*
the
mirror
,
looked
at
his
hair
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
uttered
the
word
indifferently
,
and
as
though
his
mind
were
on
*NL*
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
felt
chilled
by
something
strange
of
which
she
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
in
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
see
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
Monsieur
le
Maire
going
to
have
her
child
brought
back
to
her
?
''
*NL*
said
the
sister
,
hardly
venturing
to
put
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
;
but
it
will
take
two
or
three
days
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
were
not
to
see
Monsieur
le
Maire
until
that
time
,
''
went
on
*NL*
the
sister
,
timidly
,
``
she
would
not
know
that
Monsieur
le
Maire
had
*NL*
returned
,
and
it
would
be
easy
to
inspire
her
with
patience
;
and
when
*NL*
the
child
arrived
,
she
would
naturally
think
Monsieur
le
Maire
had
just
*NL*
come
with
the
child
.
We
should
not
have
to
enact
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
seemed
to
reflect
for
a
few
moments
;
then
he
said
with
his
*NL*
calm
gravity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sister
,
I
must
see
her
.
I
may
,
perhaps
,
be
in
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
nun
did
not
appear
to
notice
this
word
``
perhaps
,
''
which
communicated
*NL*
an
obscure
and
singular
sense
to
the
words
of
the
mayor
's
speech
.
She
*NL*
replied
,
lowering
her
eyes
and
her
voice
respectfully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
she
is
asleep
;
but
Monsieur
le
Maire
may
enter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
some
remarks
about
a
door
which
shut
badly
,
and
the
noise
of
*NL*
which
might
awaken
the
sick
woman
;
then
he
entered
Fantine
's
chamber
,
*NL*
approached
the
bed
and
drew
aside
the
curtains
.
She
was
asleep
.
Her
*NL*
breath
issued
from
her
breast
with
that
tragic
sound
which
is
peculiar
*NL*
to
those
maladies
,
and
which
breaks
the
hearts
of
mothers
when
they
are
*NL*
watching
through
the
night
beside
their
sleeping
child
who
is
condemned
*NL*
to
death
.
But
this
painful
respiration
hardly
troubled
a
sort
of
*NL*
ineffable
serenity
which
overspread
her
countenance
,
and
which
*NL*
transfigured
her
in
her
sleep
.
Her
pallor
had
become
whiteness
;
her
*NL*
cheeks
were
crimson
;
her
long
golden
lashes
,
the
only
beauty
of
her
*NL*
youth
and
her
virginity
which
remained
to
her
,
palpitated
,
though
they
*NL*
remained
closed
and
drooping
.
Her
whole
person
was
trembling
with
an
*NL*
indescribable
unfolding
of
wings
,
all
ready
to
open
wide
and
bear
her
*NL*
away
,
which
could
be
felt
as
they
rustled
,
though
they
could
not
be
*NL*
seen
.
To
see
her
thus
,
one
would
never
have
dreamed
that
she
was
*NL*
an
invalid
whose
life
was
almost
despaired
of
.
She
resembled
rather
*NL*
something
on
the
point
of
soaring
away
than
something
on
the
point
of
*NL*
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
branch
trembles
when
a
hand
approaches
it
to
pluck
a
flower
,
and
*NL*
seems
to
both
withdraw
and
to
offer
itself
at
one
and
the
same
time
.
*NL*
The
human
body
has
something
of
this
tremor
when
the
instant
arrives
in
*NL*
which
the
mysterious
fingers
of
Death
are
about
to
pluck
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
remained
for
some
time
motionless
beside
that
bed
,
gazing
*NL*
in
turn
upon
the
sick
woman
and
the
crucifix
,
as
he
had
done
two
months
*NL*
before
,
on
the
day
when
he
had
come
for
the
first
time
to
see
her
*NL*
in
that
asylum
.
They
were
both
still
there
in
the
same
attitude
--
she
*NL*
sleeping
,
he
praying
;
only
now
,
after
the
lapse
of
two
months
,
her
hair
*NL*
was
gray
and
his
was
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
had
not
entered
with
him
.
He
stood
beside
the
bed
,
with
his
*NL*
finger
on
his
lips
,
as
though
there
were
some
one
in
the
chamber
whom
he
*NL*
must
enjoin
to
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
,
saw
him
,
and
said
quietly
,
with
a
smile
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Cosette
?
''

CHAPTER

FANTINE
HAPPY
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
movement
of
either
surprise
or
of
joy
;
she
was
joy
itself
.
*NL*
That
simple
question
,
``
And
Cosette
?
''
was
put
with
so
profound
a
faith
,
*NL*
with
so
much
certainty
,
with
such
a
complete
absence
of
disquiet
and
of
*NL*
doubt
,
that
he
found
not
a
word
of
reply
.
She
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
that
you
were
there
.
I
was
asleep
,
but
I
saw
you
.
I
have
seen
*NL*
you
for
a
long
,
long
time
.
I
have
been
following
you
with
my
eyes
all
*NL*
night
long
.
You
were
in
a
glory
,
and
you
had
around
you
all
sorts
of
*NL*
celestial
forms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
glance
to
the
crucifix
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
she
resumed
,
``
tell
me
where
Cosette
is
.
Why
did
not
you
place
her
*NL*
on
my
bed
against
the
moment
of
my
waking
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
some
mechanical
reply
which
he
was
never
afterwards
able
to
*NL*
recall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
the
doctor
had
been
warned
,
and
he
now
made
his
appearance
.
*NL*
He
came
to
the
aid
of
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
,
my
child
,
''
said
the
doctor
;
``
your
child
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
's
eyes
beamed
and
filled
her
whole
face
with
light
.
She
clasped
*NL*
her
hands
with
an
expression
which
contained
all
that
is
possible
to
*NL*
prayer
in
the
way
of
violence
and
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
``
bring
her
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Touching
illusion
of
a
mother
!
Cosette
was
,
for
her
,
still
the
little
*NL*
child
who
is
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
not
just
now
.
You
still
have
some
fever
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
your
child
would
agitate
you
and
do
you
harm
.
You
must
be
*NL*
cured
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
interrupted
him
impetuously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
cured
!
Oh
,
I
tell
you
that
I
am
cured
!
What
an
ass
that
doctor
*NL*
is
!
The
idea
!
I
want
to
see
my
child
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
said
the
doctor
,
``
how
excited
you
become
.
So
long
as
you
are
*NL*
in
this
state
I
shall
oppose
your
having
your
child
.
It
is
not
enough
*NL*
to
see
her
;
it
is
necessary
that
you
should
live
for
her
.
When
you
are
*NL*
reasonable
,
I
will
bring
her
to
you
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
mother
bowed
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
doctor
,
I
really
beg
your
pardon
.
Formerly
I
should
*NL*
never
have
spoken
as
I
have
just
done
;
so
many
misfortunes
have
happened
*NL*
to
me
,
that
I
sometimes
do
not
know
what
I
am
saying
.
I
understand
you
;
*NL*
you
fear
the
emotion
.
I
will
wait
as
long
as
you
like
,
but
I
swear
to
*NL*
you
that
it
would
not
have
harmed
me
to
see
my
daughter
.
I
have
been
*NL*
seeing
her
;
I
have
not
taken
my
eyes
from
her
since
yesterday
evening
.
*NL*
Do
you
know
?
If
she
were
brought
to
me
now
,
I
should
talk
to
her
very
*NL*
gently
.
That
is
all
.
Is
it
not
quite
natural
that
I
should
desire
to
see
*NL*
my
daughter
,
who
has
been
brought
to
me
expressly
from
Montfermeil
?
I
*NL*
am
not
angry
.
I
know
well
that
I
am
about
to
be
happy
.
All
night
long
I
*NL*
have
seen
white
things
,
and
persons
who
smiled
at
me
.
When
Monsieur
le
*NL*
Docteur
pleases
,
he
shall
bring
me
Cosette
.
I
have
no
longer
any
fever
;
*NL*
I
am
well
.
I
am
perfectly
conscious
that
there
is
nothing
the
matter
*NL*
with
me
any
more
;
but
I
am
going
to
behave
as
though
I
were
ill
,
and
not
*NL*
stir
,
to
please
these
ladies
here
.
When
it
is
seen
that
I
am
very
calm
,
*NL*
they
will
say
,
`
She
must
have
her
child

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
was
sitting
on
a
chair
beside
the
bed
.
She
turned
towards
*NL*
him
;
she
was
making
a
visible
effort
to
be
calm
and
``
very
good
,
''
as
she
*NL*
expressed
it
in
the
feebleness
of
illness
which
resembles
infancy
,
in
*NL*
order
that
,
seeing
her
so
peaceable
,
they
might
make
no
difficulty
about
*NL*
bringing
Cosette
to
her
.
But
while
she
controlled
herself
she
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
questioning
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
have
a
pleasant
trip
,
Monsieur
le
Maire
?
Oh
!
how
good
you
were
*NL*
to
go
and
get
her
for
me
!
Only
tell
me
how
she
is
.
Did
she
stand
the
*NL*
journey
well
?
Alas
!
she
will
not
recognize
me
.
She
must
have
forgotten
*NL*
me
by
this
time
,
poor
darling
!
Children
have
no
memories
.
They
are
like
*NL*
birds
.
A
child
sees
one
thing
to-day
and
another
thing
to-morrow
,
and
*NL*
thinks
of
nothing
any
longer
.
And
did
she
have
white
linen
?
Did
those
*NL*
Thenardiers
keep
her
clean
?
How
have
they
fed
her
?
Oh
!
if
you
only
knew
*NL*
how
I
have
suffered
,
putting
such
questions
as
that
to
myself
during
all
*NL*
the
time
of
my
wretchedness
.
Now
,
it
is
all
past
.
I
am
happy
.
Oh
,
how
I
*NL*
should
like
to
see
her
!
Do
you
think
her
pretty
,
Monsieur
le
Maire
?
*NL*
Is
not
my
daughter
beautiful
?
You
must
have
been
very
cold
in
that
*NL*
diligence
!
Could
she
not
be
brought
for
just
one
little
instant
?
She
*NL*
might
be
taken
away
directly
afterwards
.
Tell
me
;
you
are
the
master
;
it
*NL*
could
be
so
if
you
chose
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
.
``
Cosette
is
beautiful
,
''
he
said
,
``
Cosette
is
well
.
*NL*
You
shall
see
her
soon
;
but
calm
yourself
;
you
are
talking
with
too
much
*NL*
vivacity
,
and
you
are
throwing
your
arms
out
from
under
the
clothes
,
and
*NL*
that
makes
you
cough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
fits
of
coughing
interrupted
Fantine
at
nearly
every
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
did
not
murmur
;
she
feared
that
she
had
injured
by
her
too
*NL*
passionate
lamentations
the
confidence
which
she
was
desirous
of
*NL*
inspiring
,
and
she
began
to
talk
of
indifferent
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Montfermeil
is
quite
pretty
,
is
it
not
?
People
go
there
on
pleasure
*NL*
parties
in
summer
.
Are
the
Thenardiers
prosperous
?
There
are
not
many
*NL*
travellers
in
their
parts
.
That
inn
of
theirs
is
a
sort
of
a
cook-shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
was
still
holding
her
hand
,
and
gazing
at
her
with
anxiety
;
*NL*
it
was
evident
that
he
had
come
to
tell
her
things
before
which
his
mind
*NL*
now
hesitated
.
The
doctor
,
having
finished
his
visit
,
retired
.
Sister
*NL*
Simplice
remained
alone
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
the
midst
of
this
pause
Fantine
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hear
her
!
mon
Dieu
,
I
hear
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stretched
out
her
arm
to
enjoin
silence
about
her
,
held
her
breath
,
*NL*
and
began
to
listen
with
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
child
playing
in
the
yard
--
the
child
of
the
portress
or
*NL*
of
some
work-woman
.
It
was
one
of
those
accidents
which
are
always
*NL*
occurring
,
and
which
seem
to
form
a
part
of
the
mysterious
stage-setting
*NL*
of
mournful
scenes
.
The
child
--
a
little
girl
--
was
going
and
coming
,
*NL*
running
to
warm
herself
,
laughing
,
singing
at
the
top
of
her
voice
.
*NL*
Alas
!
in
what
are
the
plays
of
children
not
intermingled
.
It
was
this
*NL*
little
girl
whom
Fantine
heard
singing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
resumed
,
``
it
is
my
Cosette
!
I
recognize
her
voice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
retreated
as
it
had
come
;
the
voice
died
away
.
Fantine
*NL*
listened
for
a
while
longer
,
then
her
face
clouded
over
,
and
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
heard
her
say
,
in
a
low
voice
:
``
How
wicked
that
doctor
is
not
*NL*
to
allow
me
to
see
my
daughter
!
That
man
has
an
evil
countenance
,
that
*NL*
he
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
smiling
background
of
her
thoughts
came
to
the
front
again
.
She
*NL*
continued
to
talk
to
herself
,
with
her
head
resting
on
the
pillow
:
``
How
*NL*
happy
we
are
going
to
be
!
We
shall
have
a
little
garden
the
very
first
*NL*
thing
;
M.
Madeleine
has
promised
it
to
me
.
My
daughter
will
play
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
She
must
know
her
letters
by
this
time
.
I
will
make
her
spell
.
*NL*
She
will
run
over
the
grass
after
butterflies
.
I
will
watch
her
.
Then
*NL*
she
will
take
her
first
communion
.
Ah
!
when
will
she
take
her
first
*NL*
communion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
reckon
on
her
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
,
two
,
three
,
four
--
she
is
seven
years
old
.
In
five
years
she
will
*NL*
have
a
white
veil
,
and
openwork
stockings
;
she
will
look
like
a
little
*NL*
woman
.
O
my
good
sister
,
you
do
not
know
how
foolish
I
become
when
I
*NL*
think
of
my
daughter
's
first
communion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
released
Fantine
's
hand
.
He
listened
to
her
words
as
one
listens
*NL*
to
the
sighing
of
the
breeze
,
with
his
eyes
on
the
ground
,
his
mind
*NL*
absorbed
in
reflection
which
had
no
bottom
.
All
at
once
she
ceased
*NL*
speaking
,
and
this
caused
him
to
raise
his
head
mechanically
.
Fantine
*NL*
had
become
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
spoke
,
she
no
longer
breathed
;
she
had
raised
herself
to
*NL*
a
sitting
posture
,
her
thin
shoulder
emerged
from
her
chemise
;
her
face
,
*NL*
which
had
been
radiant
but
a
moment
before
,
was
ghastly
,
and
she
*NL*
seemed
to
have
fixed
her
eyes
,
rendered
large
with
terror
,
on
something
*NL*
alarming
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
!
''
he
exclaimed
;
``
what
ails
you
,
Fantine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
reply
;
she
did
not
remove
her
eyes
from
the
object
which
*NL*
she
seemed
to
see
.
She
removed
one
hand
from
his
arm
,
and
with
the
other
*NL*
made
him
a
sign
to
look
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
,
and
beheld
Javert

CHAPTER
III
--
JAVERT
SATISFIED
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
had
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
half-hour
after
midnight
had
just
struck
when
M.
Madeleine
quitted
*NL*
the
Hall
of
Assizes
in
Arras
.
He
regained
his
inn
just
in
time
to
set
*NL*
out
again
by
the
mail-wagon
,
in
which
he
had
engaged
his
place
.
A
little
*NL*
before
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
he
had
arrived
at
M.
sur
M.
,
and
his
*NL*
first
care
had
been
to
post
a
letter
to
M.
Laffitte
,
then
to
enter
the
*NL*
infirmary
and
see
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
had
hardly
quitted
the
audience
hall
of
the
Court
of
*NL*
Assizes
,
when
the
district-attorney
,
recovering
from
his
first
shock
,
*NL*
had
taken
the
word
to
deplore
the
mad
deed
of
the
honorable
mayor
of
*NL*
M.
sur
M.
,
to
declare
that
his
convictions
had
not
been
in
the
least
*NL*
modified
by
that
curious
incident
,
which
would
be
explained
thereafter
,
*NL*
and
to
demand
,
in
the
meantime
,
the
condemnation
of
that
Champmathieu
,
*NL*
who
was
evidently
the
real
Jean
Valjean
.
The
district-attorney
's
*NL*
persistence
was
visibly
at
variance
with
the
sentiments
of
every
one
,
of
*NL*
the
public
,
of
the
court
,
and
of
the
jury
.
The
counsel
for
the
defence
*NL*
had
some
difficulty
in
refuting
this
harangue
and
in
establishing
that
,
*NL*
in
consequence
of
the
revelations
of
M.
Madeleine
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
*NL*
the
real
Jean
Valjean
,
the
aspect
of
the
matter
had
been
thoroughly
*NL*
altered
,
and
that
the
jury
had
before
their
eyes
now
only
an
innocent
*NL*
man
.
Thence
the
lawyer
had
drawn
some
epiphonemas
,
not
very
fresh
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
upon
judicial
errors
,
etc.
,
etc.
;
the
President
,
in
his
*NL*
summing
up
,
had
joined
the
counsel
for
the
defence
,
and
in
a
few
minutes
*NL*
the
jury
had
thrown
Champmathieu
out
of
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
district-attorney
was
bent
on
having
a
Jean
Valjean
;
*NL*
and
as
he
had
no
longer
Champmathieu
,
he
took
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
Champmathieu
had
been
set
at
liberty
,
the
*NL*
district-attorney
shut
himself
up
with
the
President
.
They
conferred
``
as
*NL*
to
the
necessity
of
seizing
the
person
of
M.
le
Maire
of
M.
sur
M.
''
*NL*
This
phrase
,
in
which
there
was
a
great
deal
of
of
,
is
the
*NL*
district-attorney
's
,
written
with
his
own
hand
,
on
the
minutes
of
his
*NL*
report
to
the
attorney-general
.
His
first
emotion
having
passed
off
,
the
*NL*
President
did
not
offer
many
objections
.
Justice
must
,
after
all
,
take
*NL*
its
course
.
And
then
,
when
all
was
said
,
although
the
President
was
*NL*
a
kindly
and
a
tolerably
intelligent
man
,
he
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
*NL*
devoted
and
almost
an
ardent
royalist
,
and
he
had
been
shocked
to
hear
*NL*
the
Mayor
of
M.
sur
M.
say
the
Emperor
,
and
not
Bonaparte
,
when
alluding
*NL*
to
the
landing
at
Cannes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
order
for
his
arrest
was
accordingly
despatched
.
The
*NL*
district-attorney
forwarded
it
to
M.
sur
M.
by
a
special
messenger
,
at
*NL*
full
speed
,
and
entrusted
its
execution
to
Police
Inspector
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
knows
that
Javert
had
returned
to
M.
sur
M.
immediately
after
*NL*
having
given
his
deposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
just
getting
out
of
bed
when
the
messenger
handed
him
the
*NL*
order
of
arrest
and
the
command
to
produce
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
messenger
himself
was
a
very
clever
member
of
the
police
,
who
,
in
*NL*
two
words
,
informed
Javert
of
what
had
taken
place
at
Arras
.
The
order
*NL*
of
arrest
,
signed
by
the
district-attorney
,
was
couched
in
these
words
:
*NL*
``
Inspector
Javert
will
apprehend
the
body
of
the
Sieur
Madeleine
,
mayor
*NL*
of
M.
sur
M.
,
who
,
in
this
day
's
session
of
the
court
,
was
recognized
as
*NL*
the
liberated
convict
,
Jean
Valjean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
did
not
know
Javert
,
and
who
had
chanced
to
see
him
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
penetrated
the
antechamber
of
the
infirmary
,
could
have
*NL*
divined
nothing
of
what
had
taken
place
,
and
would
have
thought
his
air
*NL*
the
most
ordinary
in
the
world
.
He
was
cool
,
calm
,
grave
,
his
gray
*NL*
hair
was
perfectly
smooth
upon
his
temples
,
and
he
had
just
mounted
*NL*
the
stairs
with
his
habitual
deliberation
.
Any
one
who
was
thoroughly
*NL*
acquainted
with
him
,
and
who
had
examined
him
attentively
at
the
moment
,
*NL*
would
have
shuddered
.
The
buckle
of
his
leather
stock
was
under
his
*NL*
left
ear
instead
of
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
.
This
betrayed
unwonted
*NL*
agitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
a
complete
character
,
who
never
had
a
wrinkle
in
his
duty
or
*NL*
in
his
uniform
;
methodical
with
malefactors
,
rigid
with
the
buttons
of
*NL*
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
should
have
set
the
buckle
of
his
stock
awry
,
it
was
*NL*
indispensable
that
there
should
have
taken
place
in
him
one
of
those
*NL*
emotions
which
may
be
designated
as
internal
earthquakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
in
a
simple
way
,
had
made
a
requisition
on
the
neighboring
*NL*
post
for
a
corporal
and
four
soldiers
,
had
left
the
soldiers
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
,
had
had
Fantine
's
room
pointed
out
to
him
by
the
portress
,
*NL*
who
was
utterly
unsuspicious
,
accustomed
as
she
was
to
seeing
armed
men
*NL*
inquiring
for
the
mayor
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
Fantine
's
chamber
,
Javert
turned
the
handle
,
pushed
*NL*
the
door
open
with
the
gentleness
of
a
sick-nurse
or
a
police
spy
,
and
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Properly
speaking
,
he
did
not
enter
.
He
stood
erect
in
the
half-open
*NL*
door
,
his
hat
on
his
head
and
his
left
hand
thrust
into
his
coat
,
which
*NL*
was
buttoned
up
to
the
chin
.
In
the
bend
of
his
elbow
the
leaden
head
of
*NL*
his
enormous
cane
,
which
was
hidden
behind
him
,
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
remained
for
nearly
a
minute
,
without
his
presence
being
*NL*
perceived
.
All
at
once
Fantine
raised
her
eyes
,
saw
him
,
and
made
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
turn
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
instant
that
Madeleine
's
glance
encountered
Javert
's
glance
,
Javert
,
*NL*
without
stirring
,
without
moving
from
his
post
,
without
approaching
him
,
*NL*
became
terrible
.
No
human
sentiment
can
be
as
terrible
as
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
visage
of
a
demon
who
has
just
found
his
damned
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
satisfaction
of
at
last
getting
hold
of
Jean
Valjean
caused
all
that
*NL*
was
in
his
soul
to
appear
in
his
countenance
.
The
depths
having
been
*NL*
stirred
up
,
mounted
to
the
surface
.
The
humiliation
of
having
,
in
*NL*
some
slight
degree
,
lost
the
scent
,
and
of
having
indulged
,
for
a
few
*NL*
moments
,
in
an
error
with
regard
to
Champmathieu
,
was
effaced
by
pride
*NL*
at
having
so
well
and
accurately
divined
in
the
first
place
,
and
of
*NL*
having
for
so
long
cherished
a
just
instinct
.
Javert
's
content
shone
*NL*
forth
in
his
sovereign
attitude
.
The
deformity
of
triumph
overspread
*NL*
that
narrow
brow
.
All
the
demonstrations
of
horror
which
a
satisfied
*NL*
face
can
afford
were
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
in
heaven
at
that
moment
.
Without
putting
the
thing
clearly
*NL*
to
himself
,
but
with
a
confused
intuition
of
the
necessity
of
his
*NL*
presence
and
of
his
success
,
he
,
Javert
,
personified
justice
,
light
,
and
*NL*
truth
in
their
celestial
function
of
crushing
out
evil
.
Behind
him
and
*NL*
around
him
,
at
an
infinite
distance
,
he
had
authority
,
reason
,
the
case
*NL*
judged
,
the
legal
conscience
,
the
public
prosecution
,
all
the
stars
;
he
*NL*
was
protecting
order
,
he
was
causing
the
law
to
yield
up
its
thunders
,
*NL*
he
was
avenging
society
,
he
was
lending
a
helping
hand
to
the
absolute
,
*NL*
he
was
standing
erect
in
the
midst
of
a
glory
.
There
existed
in
his
*NL*
victory
a
remnant
of
defiance
and
of
combat
.
Erect
,
haughty
,
brilliant
,
*NL*
he
flaunted
abroad
in
open
day
the
superhuman
bestiality
of
a
ferocious
*NL*
archangel
.
The
terrible
shadow
of
the
action
which
he
was
accomplishing
*NL*
caused
the
vague
flash
of
the
social
sword
to
be
visible
in
his
clenched
*NL*
fist
;
happy
and
indignant
,
he
held
his
heel
upon
crime
,
vice
,
rebellion
,
*NL*
perdition
,
hell
;
he
was
radiant
,
he
exterminated
,
he
smiled
,
and
there
*NL*
was
an
incontestable
grandeur
in
this
monstrous
Saint
Michael
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
,
though
frightful
,
had
nothing
ignoble
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Probity
,
sincerity
,
candor
,
conviction
,
the
sense
of
duty
,
are
things
*NL*
which
may
become
hideous
when
wrongly
directed
;
but
which
,
even
when
*NL*
hideous
,
remain
grand
:
their
majesty
,
the
majesty
peculiar
to
the
human
*NL*
conscience
,
clings
to
them
in
the
midst
of
horror
;
they
are
virtues
*NL*
which
have
one
vice
,
--
error
.
The
honest
,
pitiless
joy
of
a
fanatic
*NL*
in
the
full
flood
of
his
atrocity
preserves
a
certain
lugubriously
*NL*
venerable
radiance
.
Without
himself
suspecting
the
fact
,
Javert
in
his
*NL*
formidable
happiness
was
to
be
pitied
,
as
is
every
ignorant
man
who
*NL*
triumphs
.
Nothing
could
be
so
poignant
and
so
terrible
as
this
face
,
*NL*
wherein
was
displayed
all
that
may
be
designated
as
the
evil
of
the
*NL*
good
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
AUTHORITY
REASSERTS
ITS
RIGHTS
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
had
not
seen
Javert
since
the
day
on
which
the
mayor
had
torn
*NL*
her
from
the
man
.
Her
ailing
brain
comprehended
nothing
,
but
the
only
*NL*
thing
which
she
did
not
doubt
was
that
he
had
come
to
get
her
.
She
could
*NL*
not
endure
that
terrible
face
;
she
felt
her
life
quitting
her
;
she
hid
*NL*
her
face
in
both
hands
,
and
shrieked
in
her
anguish
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Madeleine
,
save
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
--
we
shall
henceforth
not
speak
of
him
otherwise
--
had
risen
.
*NL*
He
said
to
Fantine
in
the
gentlest
and
calmest
of
voices
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
at
ease
;
it
is
not
for
you
that
he
is
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
addressed
Javert
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
what
you
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quick
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
lay
in
the
inflection
of
voice
which
accompanied
these
words
*NL*
something
indescribably
fierce
and
frenzied
.
Javert
did
not
say
,
``
Be
*NL*
quick
about
it
!
''
he
said
``
Bequiabouit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
orthography
can
do
justice
to
the
accent
with
which
it
was
uttered
:
*NL*
it
was
no
longer
a
human
word
:
it
was
a
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
proceed
according
to
his
custom
,
he
did
not
enter
into
the
*NL*
matter
,
he
exhibited
no
warrant
of
arrest
.
In
his
eyes
,
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
was
a
sort
of
mysterious
combatant
,
who
was
not
to
be
laid
hands
upon
,
*NL*
a
wrestler
in
the
dark
whom
he
had
had
in
his
grasp
for
the
last
five
*NL*
years
,
without
being
able
to
throw
him
.
This
arrest
was
not
a
beginning
,
*NL*
but
an
end
.
He
confined
himself
to
saying
,
``
Be
quick
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
thus
,
he
did
not
advance
a
single
step
;
he
hurled
at
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
a
glance
which
he
threw
out
like
a
grappling-hook
,
and
with
*NL*
which
he
was
accustomed
to
draw
wretches
violently
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
glance
which
Fantine
had
felt
penetrating
to
the
very
marrow
*NL*
of
her
bones
two
months
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Javert
's
exclamation
,
Fantine
opened
her
eyes
once
more
.
But
the
*NL*
mayor
was
there
;
what
had
she
to
fear
?
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
now
!
Art
thou
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unhappy
woman
glanced
about
her
.
No
one
was
present
excepting
the
*NL*
nun
and
the
mayor
.
To
whom
could
that
abject
use
of
``
thou
''
be
addressed
?
*NL*
To
her
only
.
She
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
beheld
a
most
unprecedented
thing
,
a
thing
so
unprecedented
*NL*
that
nothing
equal
to
it
had
appeared
to
her
even
in
the
blackest
*NL*
deliriums
of
fever
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
beheld
Javert
,
the
police
spy
,
seize
the
mayor
by
the
collar
;
she
*NL*
saw
the
mayor
bow
his
head
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
the
world
was
coming
*NL*
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
had
,
in
fact
,
grasped
Jean
Valjean
by
the
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Maire
!
''
shrieked
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
burst
out
laughing
with
that
frightful
laugh
which
displayed
all
*NL*
his
gums
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
longer
any
Monsieur
le
Maire
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
made
no
attempt
to
disengage
the
hand
which
grasped
the
*NL*
collar
of
his
coat
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Javert
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
interrupted
him
:
``
Call
me
Mr.
Inspector
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
should
like
to
say
a
word
to
you
in
*NL*
private
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aloud
!
Say
it
aloud
!
''
replied
Javert
;
``
people
are
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
talking
aloud
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
went
on
in
a
lower
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
request
to
make
of
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
to
speak
loud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
alone
should
hear
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
difference
does
that
make
to
me
?
I
shall
not
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
towards
him
and
said
very
rapidly
and
in
a
very
low
*NL*
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grant
me
three
days
'
grace
!
three
days
in
which
to
go
and
fetch
the
*NL*
child
of
this
unhappy
woman
.
I
will
pay
whatever
is
necessary
.
You
shall
*NL*
accompany
me
if
you
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
making
sport
of
me
!
''
cried
Javert
.
``
Come
now
,
I
did
not
think
*NL*
you
such
a
fool
!
You
ask
me
to
give
you
three
days
in
which
to
run
away
!
*NL*
You
say
that
it
is
for
the
purpose
of
fetching
that
creature
's
child
!
*NL*
Ah
!
Ah
!
That
's
good
!
That
's
really
capital
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
!
''
she
cried
,
``
to
go
and
fetch
my
child
!
She
is
not
here
,
*NL*
then
!
Answer
me
,
sister
;
where
is
Cosette
?
I
want
my
child
!
Monsieur
*NL*
Madeleine
!
Monsieur
le
Maire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
stamped
his
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
there
's
the
other
one
!
Will
you
hold
your
tongue
,
you
hussy
?
*NL*
It
's
a
pretty
sort
of
a
place
where
convicts
are
magistrates
,
and
where
*NL*
women
of
the
town
are
cared
for
like
countesses
!
Ah
!
But
we
are
going
to
*NL*
change
all
that
;
it
is
high
time
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
intently
at
Fantine
,
and
added
,
once
more
taking
into
his
*NL*
grasp
Jean
Valjean
's
cravat
,
shirt
and
collar
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
there
is
no
Monsieur
Madeleine
and
that
there
is
no
*NL*
Monsieur
le
Maire
.
There
is
a
thief
,
a
brigand
,
a
convict
named
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
!
And
I
have
him
in
my
grasp
!
That
's
what
there
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
raised
herself
in
bed
with
a
bound
,
supporting
herself
on
her
*NL*
stiffened
arms
and
on
both
hands
:
she
gazed
at
Jean
Valjean
,
she
gazed
*NL*
at
Javert
,
she
gazed
at
the
nun
,
she
opened
her
mouth
as
though
to
*NL*
speak
;
a
rattle
proceeded
from
the
depths
of
her
throat
,
her
teeth
*NL*
chattered
;
she
stretched
out
her
arms
in
her
agony
,
opening
her
hands
*NL*
convulsively
,
and
fumbling
about
her
like
a
drowning
person
;
then
*NL*
suddenly
fell
back
on
her
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
head
struck
the
head-board
of
the
bed
and
fell
forwards
on
her
*NL*
breast
,
with
gaping
mouth
and
staring
,
sightless
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
laid
his
hand
upon
the
detaining
hand
of
Javert
,
and
opened
*NL*
it
as
he
would
have
opened
the
hand
of
a
baby
;
then
he
said
to
Javert
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
murdered
that
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
have
an
end
of
this
!
''
shouted
Javert
,
in
a
fury
;
``
I
am
not
here
*NL*
to
listen
to
argument
.
Let
us
economize
all
that
;
the
guard
is
below
;
*NL*
march
on
instantly
,
or
you
'll
get
the
thumb-screws
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
corner
of
the
room
stood
an
old
iron
bedstead
,
which
was
in
a
*NL*
decidedly
decrepit
state
,
and
which
served
the
sisters
as
a
camp-bed
*NL*
when
they
were
watching
with
the
sick
.
Jean
Valjean
stepped
up
to
this
*NL*
bed
,
in
a
twinkling
wrenched
off
the
head-piece
,
which
was
already
in
a
*NL*
dilapidated
condition
,
an
easy
matter
to
muscles
like
his
,
grasped
the
*NL*
principal
rod
like
a
bludgeon
,
and
glanced
at
Javert
.
Javert
retreated
*NL*
towards
the
door
.
Jean
Valjean
,
armed
with
his
bar
of
iron
,
walked
*NL*
slowly
up
to
Fantine
's
couch
.
When
he
arrived
there
he
turned
and
said
*NL*
to
Javert
,
in
a
voice
that
was
barely
audible
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
advise
you
not
to
disturb
me
at
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
is
certain
,
and
that
is
,
that
Javert
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
occur
to
him
to
summon
the
guard
,
but
Jean
Valjean
might
avail
*NL*
himself
of
that
moment
to
effect
his
escape
;
so
he
remained
,
grasped
*NL*
his
cane
by
the
small
end
,
and
leaned
against
the
door-post
,
without
*NL*
removing
his
eyes
from
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
rested
his
elbow
on
the
knob
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
and
*NL*
his
brow
on
his
hand
,
and
began
to
contemplate
the
motionless
body
of
*NL*
Fantine
,
which
lay
extended
there
.
He
remained
thus
,
mute
,
absorbed
,
*NL*
evidently
with
no
further
thought
of
anything
connected
with
this
life
.
*NL*
Upon
his
face
and
in
his
attitude
there
was
nothing
but
inexpressible
*NL*
pity
.
After
a
few
moments
of
this
meditation
he
bent
towards
Fantine
,
*NL*
and
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
he
say
to
her
?
What
could
this
man
,
who
was
reproved
,
say
to
*NL*
that
woman
,
who
was
dead
?
What
words
were
those
?
No
one
on
earth
heard
*NL*
them
.
Did
the
dead
woman
hear
them
?
There
are
some
touching
illusions
*NL*
which
are
,
perhaps
,
sublime
realities
.
The
point
as
to
which
there
*NL*
exists
no
doubt
is
,
that
Sister
Simplice
,
the
sole
witness
of
the
*NL*
incident
,
often
said
that
at
the
moment
that
Jean
Valjean
whispered
in
*NL*
Fantine
's
ear
,
she
distinctly
beheld
an
ineffable
smile
dawn
on
those
*NL*
pale
lips
,
and
in
those
dim
eyes
,
filled
with
the
amazement
of
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
took
Fantine
's
head
in
both
his
hands
,
and
arranged
it
on
*NL*
the
pillow
as
a
mother
might
have
done
for
her
child
;
then
he
tied
the
*NL*
string
of
her
chemise
,
and
smoothed
her
hair
back
under
her
cap
.
That
*NL*
done
,
he
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
's
face
seemed
strangely
illuminated
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Death
,
that
signifies
entrance
into
the
great
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fantine
's
hand
was
hanging
over
the
side
of
the
bed
.
Jean
Valjean
knelt
*NL*
down
before
that
hand
,
lifted
it
gently
,
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
rose
,
and
turned
to
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
am
at
your
disposal
.

CHAPTER
V
--
A
SUITABLE
TOMB
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
deposited
Jean
Valjean
in
the
city
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrest
of
M.
Madeleine
occasioned
a
sensation
,
or
rather
,
an
*NL*
extraordinary
commotion
in
M.
sur
M
.
We
are
sorry
that
we
can
not
conceal
*NL*
the
fact
,
that
at
the
single
word
,
``
He
was
a
convict
,
''
nearly
every
one
*NL*
deserted
him
.
In
less
than
two
hours
all
the
good
that
he
had
done
had
*NL*
been
forgotten
,
and
he
was
nothing
but
a
``
convict
from
the
galleys
.
''
It
*NL*
is
just
to
add
that
the
details
of
what
had
taken
place
at
Arras
were
*NL*
not
yet
known
.
All
day
long
conversations
like
the
following
were
to
be
*NL*
heard
in
all
quarters
of
the
town
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
?
He
was
a
liberated
convict
!
''
``
Who
?
''
``
The
mayor
.
''
``
Bah
!
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
?
''
``
Yes
.
''
``
Really
?
''
``
His
name
was
not
Madeleine
at
all
;
he
*NL*
had
a
frightful
name
,
Bejean
,
Bojean
,
Boujean
.
''
``
Ah
!
Good
God
!
''
``
He
*NL*
has
been
arrested
.
''
``
Arrested
!
''
``
In
prison
,
in
the
city
prison
,
while
*NL*
waiting
to
be
transferred
.
''
``
Until
he
is
transferred
!
''
``
He
is
to
be
*NL*
transferred
!
''
``
Where
is
he
to
be
taken
?
''
``
He
will
be
tried
at
the
*NL*
Assizes
for
a
highway
robbery
which
he
committed
long
ago
.
''
``
Well
!
I
*NL*
suspected
as
much
.
That
man
was
too
good
,
too
perfect
,
too
affected
.
*NL*
He
refused
the
cross
;
he
bestowed
sous
on
all
the
little
scamps
he
came
*NL*
across
.
I
always
thought
there
was
some
evil
history
back
of
all
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
drawing-rooms
''
particularly
abounded
in
remarks
of
this
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
old
lady
,
a
subscriber
to
the
Drapeau
Blanc
,
made
the
following
*NL*
remark
,
the
depth
of
which
it
is
impossible
to
fathom
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sorry
.
It
will
be
a
lesson
to
the
Bonapartists
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
that
the
phantom
which
had
been
called
M.
Madeleine
vanished
*NL*
from
M.
sur
M.
Only
three
or
four
persons
in
all
the
town
remained
*NL*
faithful
to
his
memory
.
The
old
portress
who
had
served
him
was
among
*NL*
the
number
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
that
day
the
worthy
old
woman
was
sitting
in
her
*NL*
lodge
,
still
in
a
thorough
fright
,
and
absorbed
in
sad
reflections
.
*NL*
The
factory
had
been
closed
all
day
,
the
carriage
gate
was
bolted
,
the
*NL*
street
was
deserted
.
There
was
no
one
in
the
house
but
the
two
nuns
,
*NL*
Sister
Perpetue
and
Sister
Simplice
,
who
were
watching
beside
the
body
*NL*
of
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
hour
when
M.
Madeleine
was
accustomed
to
return
home
,
*NL*
the
good
portress
rose
mechanically
,
took
from
a
drawer
the
key
of
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
's
chamber
,
and
the
flat
candlestick
which
he
used
every
*NL*
evening
to
go
up
to
his
quarters
;
then
she
hung
the
key
on
the
nail
*NL*
whence
he
was
accustomed
to
take
it
,
and
set
the
candlestick
on
one
*NL*
side
,
as
though
she
was
expecting
him
.
Then
she
sat
down
again
on
her
*NL*
chair
,
and
became
absorbed
in
thought
once
more
.
The
poor
,
good
old
*NL*
woman
had
done
all
this
without
being
conscious
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
at
the
expiration
of
two
hours
that
she
roused
herself
from
*NL*
her
revery
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Hold
!
My
good
God
Jesus
!
And
I
hung
his
key
*NL*
on
the
nail
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
small
window
in
the
lodge
opened
,
a
hand
passed
*NL*
through
,
seized
the
key
and
the
candlestick
,
and
lighted
the
taper
at
*NL*
the
candle
which
was
burning
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
portress
raised
her
eyes
,
and
stood
there
with
gaping
mouth
,
and
a
*NL*
shriek
which
she
confined
to
her
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
hand
,
that
arm
,
the
sleeve
of
that
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
several
seconds
before
she
could
speak
;
she
had
a
seizure
,
as
she
*NL*
said
herself
,
when
she
related
the
adventure
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
God
,
Monsieur
le
Maire
,
''
she
cried
at
last
,
``
I
thought
you
were
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
;
the
conclusion
of
her
sentence
would
have
been
lacking
in
*NL*
respect
towards
the
beginning
.
Jean
Valjean
was
still
Monsieur
le
Maire
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
finished
her
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
prison
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
was
there
;
I
broke
a
bar
of
one
of
the
windows
;
*NL*
I
let
myself
drop
from
the
top
of
a
roof
,
and
here
I
am
.
I
am
going
up
*NL*
to
my
room
;
go
and
find
Sister
Simplice
for
me
.
She
is
with
that
poor
*NL*
woman
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
obeyed
in
all
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
no
orders
;
he
was
quite
sure
that
she
would
guard
him
better
*NL*
than
he
should
guard
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
ever
found
out
how
he
had
managed
to
get
into
the
courtyard
*NL*
without
opening
the
big
gates
.
He
had
,
and
always
carried
about
him
,
*NL*
a
pass-key
which
opened
a
little
side-door
;
but
he
must
have
been
*NL*
searched
,
and
his
latch-key
must
have
been
taken
from
him
.
This
point
*NL*
was
never
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ascended
the
staircase
leading
to
his
chamber
.
On
arriving
at
the
*NL*
top
,
he
left
his
candle
on
the
top
step
of
his
stairs
,
opened
his
door
*NL*
with
very
little
noise
,
went
and
closed
his
window
and
his
shutters
by
*NL*
feeling
,
then
returned
for
his
candle
and
re-entered
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
useful
precaution
;
it
will
be
recollected
that
his
window
could
*NL*
be
seen
from
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
a
glance
about
him
,
at
his
table
,
at
his
chair
,
at
his
bed
which
*NL*
had
not
been
disturbed
for
three
days
.
No
trace
of
the
disorder
of
the
*NL*
night
before
last
remained
.
The
portress
had
``
done
up
''
his
room
;
only
*NL*
she
had
picked
out
of
the
ashes
and
placed
neatly
on
the
table
the
two
*NL*
iron
ends
of
the
cudgel
and
the
forty-sou
piece
which
had
been
blackened
*NL*
by
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
sheet
of
paper
,
on
which
he
wrote
:
``
These
are
the
two
tips
of
*NL*
my
iron-shod
cudgel
and
the
forty-sou
piece
stolen
from
Little
Gervais
,
*NL*
which
I
mentioned
at
the
Court
of
Assizes
,
''
and
he
arranged
this
piece
*NL*
of
paper
,
the
bits
of
iron
,
and
the
coin
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
*NL*
the
first
things
to
be
seen
on
entering
the
room
.
From
a
cupboard
he
*NL*
pulled
out
one
of
his
old
shirts
,
which
he
tore
in
pieces
.
In
the
*NL*
strips
of
linen
thus
prepared
he
wrapped
the
two
silver
candlesticks
.
He
*NL*
betrayed
neither
haste
nor
agitation
;
and
while
he
was
wrapping
up
the
*NL*
Bishop
's
candlesticks
,
he
nibbled
at
a
piece
of
black
bread
.
It
was
*NL*
probably
the
prison-bread
which
he
had
carried
with
him
in
his
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
proved
by
the
crumbs
which
were
found
on
the
floor
of
the
room
*NL*
when
the
authorities
made
an
examination
later
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
two
taps
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Sister
Simplice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
pale
;
her
eyes
were
red
;
the
candle
which
she
carried
trembled
*NL*
in
her
hand
.
The
peculiar
feature
of
the
violences
of
destiny
is
,
that
*NL*
however
polished
or
cool
we
may
be
,
they
wring
human
nature
from
our
*NL*
very
bowels
,
and
force
it
to
reappear
on
the
surface
.
The
emotions
of
*NL*
that
day
had
turned
the
nun
into
a
woman
once
more
.
She
had
wept
,
and
*NL*
she
was
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
just
finished
writing
a
few
lines
on
a
paper
,
which
he
*NL*
handed
to
the
nun
,
saying
,
``
Sister
,
you
will
give
this
to
Monsieur
le
*NL*
Cure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
paper
was
not
folded
.
She
cast
a
glance
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
read
it
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
Monsieur
le
Cure
to
keep
an
eye
on
all
that
I
leave
behind
me
.
He
*NL*
will
be
so
good
as
to
pay
out
of
it
the
expenses
of
my
trial
,
and
of
the
*NL*
funeral
of
the
woman
who
died
yesterday
.
The
rest
is
for
the
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
tried
to
speak
,
but
she
only
managed
to
stammer
a
few
*NL*
inarticulate
sounds
.
She
succeeded
in
saying
,
however
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
not
Monsieur
le
Maire
desire
to
take
a
last
look
at
that
poor
,
*NL*
unhappy
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
am
pursued
;
it
would
only
end
in
their
arresting
me
in
*NL*
that
room
,
and
that
would
disturb
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
finished
when
a
loud
noise
became
audible
on
the
*NL*
staircase
.
They
heard
a
tumult
of
ascending
footsteps
,
and
the
old
*NL*
portress
saying
in
her
loudest
and
most
piercing
tones
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
good
sir
,
I
swear
to
you
by
the
good
God
,
that
not
a
soul
has
*NL*
entered
this
house
all
day
,
nor
all
the
evening
,
and
that
I
have
not
*NL*
even
left
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
responded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
a
light
in
that
room
,
nevertheless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
recognized
Javert
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chamber
was
so
arranged
that
the
door
in
opening
masked
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
wall
on
the
right
.
Jean
Valjean
blew
out
the
light
and
placed
*NL*
himself
in
this
angle
.
Sister
Simplice
fell
on
her
knees
near
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whispers
of
many
men
and
the
protestations
of
the
portress
were
*NL*
audible
in
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nun
did
not
raise
her
eyes
.
She
was
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candle
was
on
the
chimney-piece
,
and
gave
but
very
little
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
caught
sight
of
the
nun
and
halted
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
that
the
fundamental
point
in
Javert
,
his
element
,
*NL*
the
very
air
he
breathed
,
was
veneration
for
all
authority
.
This
was
*NL*
impregnable
,
and
admitted
of
neither
objection
nor
restriction
.
In
his
*NL*
eyes
,
of
course
,
the
ecclesiastical
authority
was
the
chief
of
all
;
he
*NL*
was
religious
,
superficial
and
correct
on
this
point
as
on
all
others
.
*NL*
In
his
eyes
,
a
priest
was
a
mind
,
who
never
makes
a
mistake
;
a
nun
was
a
*NL*
creature
who
never
sins
;
they
were
souls
walled
in
from
this
world
,
*NL*
with
a
single
door
which
never
opened
except
to
allow
the
truth
to
pass
*NL*
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
perceiving
the
sister
,
his
first
movement
was
to
retire
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
also
another
duty
which
bound
him
and
impelled
him
*NL*
imperiously
in
the
opposite
direction
.
His
second
movement
was
to
remain
*NL*
and
to
venture
on
at
least
one
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Sister
Simplice
,
who
had
never
told
a
lie
in
her
life
.
Javert
*NL*
knew
it
,
and
held
her
in
special
veneration
in
consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sister
,
''
said
he
,
``
are
you
alone
in
this
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
moment
ensued
,
during
which
the
poor
portress
felt
as
though
*NL*
she
should
faint
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
raised
her
eyes
and
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
resumed
Javert
,
``
you
will
excuse
me
if
I
persist
;
it
is
my
duty
;
*NL*
you
have
not
seen
a
certain
person
--
a
man
--
this
evening
?
He
has
escaped
;
*NL*
we
are
in
search
of
him
--
that
Jean
Valjean
;
you
have
not
seen
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lied
.
She
had
lied
twice
in
succession
,
one
after
the
other
,
without
*NL*
hesitation
,
promptly
,
as
a
person
does
when
sacrificing
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
said
Javert
,
and
he
retired
with
a
deep
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
O
sainted
maid
!
you
left
this
world
many
years
ago
;
you
have
rejoined
*NL*
your
sisters
,
the
virgins
,
and
your
brothers
,
the
angels
,
in
the
light
;
*NL*
may
this
lie
be
counted
to
your
credit
in
paradise
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
sister
's
affirmation
was
for
Javert
so
decisive
a
thing
that
he
did
*NL*
not
even
observe
the
singularity
of
that
candle
which
had
but
just
been
*NL*
extinguished
,
and
which
was
still
smoking
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
,
a
man
,
marching
amid
trees
and
mists
,
was
rapidly
*NL*
departing
from
M.
sur
M.
in
the
direction
of
Paris
.
That
man
was
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
It
has
been
established
by
the
testimony
of
two
or
three
*NL*
carters
who
met
him
,
that
he
was
carrying
a
bundle
;
that
he
was
dressed
*NL*
in
a
blouse
.
Where
had
he
obtained
that
blouse
?
No
one
ever
found
out
.
*NL*
But
an
aged
workman
had
died
in
the
infirmary
of
the
factory
a
few
days
*NL*
before
,
leaving
behind
him
nothing
but
his
blouse
.
Perhaps
that
was
the
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
last
word
about
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
all
have
a
mother
,
--
the
earth
.
Fantine
was
given
back
to
that
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cure
thought
that
he
was
doing
right
,
and
perhaps
he
really
was
,
in
*NL*
reserving
as
much
money
as
possible
from
what
Jean
Valjean
had
left
for
*NL*
the
poor
.
Who
was
concerned
,
after
all
?
A
convict
and
a
woman
of
the
*NL*
town
.
That
is
why
he
had
a
very
simple
funeral
for
Fantine
,
and
reduced
*NL*
it
to
that
strictly
necessary
form
known
as
the
pauper
's
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Fantine
was
buried
in
the
free
corner
of
the
cemetery
which
belongs
*NL*
to
anybody
and
everybody
,
and
where
the
poor
are
lost
.
Fortunately
,
God
*NL*
knows
where
to
find
the
soul
again
.
Fantine
was
laid
in
the
shade
,
*NL*
among
the
first
bones
that
came
to
hand
;
she
was
subjected
to
the
*NL*
promiscuousness
of
ashes
.
She
was
thrown
into
the
public
grave
.
Her
*NL*
grave
resembled
her
bed
.

WHAT
IS
MET
WITH
ON
THE
WAY
FROM
NIVELLES
*NL*
*NL*
Last
year
-LRB-
1861
-RRB-
,
on
a
beautiful
May
morning
,
a
traveller
,
the
person
*NL*
who
is
telling
this
story
,
was
coming
from
Nivelles
,
and
directing
his
*NL*
course
towards
La
Hulpe
.
He
was
on
foot
.
He
was
pursuing
a
broad
paved
*NL*
road
,
which
undulated
between
two
rows
of
trees
,
over
the
hills
which
*NL*
succeed
each
other
,
raise
the
road
and
let
it
fall
again
,
and
produce
*NL*
something
in
the
nature
of
enormous
waves
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
passed
Lillois
and
Bois-Seigneur-Isaac
.
In
the
west
he
perceived
*NL*
the
slate-roofed
tower
of
Braine-l'Alleud
,
which
has
the
form
of
a
*NL*
reversed
vase
.
He
had
just
left
behind
a
wood
upon
an
eminence
;
and
*NL*
at
the
angle
of
the
cross-road
,
by
the
side
of
a
sort
of
mouldy
gibbet
*NL*
bearing
the
inscription
Ancient
Barrier
No.
4
,
a
public
house
,
bearing
*NL*
on
its
front
this
sign
:
At
the
Four
Winds
-LRB-
Aux
Quatre
Vents
-RRB-
.
Echabeau
,
*NL*
Private
Cafe
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
a
league
further
on
,
he
arrived
at
the
bottom
of
a
little
*NL*
valley
,
where
there
is
water
which
passes
beneath
an
arch
made
through
*NL*
the
embankment
of
the
road
.
The
clump
of
sparsely
planted
but
very
green
*NL*
trees
,
which
fills
the
valley
on
one
side
of
the
road
,
is
dispersed
over
*NL*
the
meadows
on
the
other
,
and
disappears
gracefully
and
as
in
order
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
Braine-l'Alleud
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
right
,
close
to
the
road
,
was
an
inn
,
with
a
four-wheeled
cart
*NL*
at
the
door
,
a
large
bundle
of
hop-poles
,
a
plough
,
a
heap
of
dried
*NL*
brushwood
near
a
flourishing
hedge
,
lime
smoking
in
a
square
hole
,
and
*NL*
a
ladder
suspended
along
an
old
penthouse
with
straw
partitions
.
A
young
*NL*
girl
was
weeding
in
a
field
,
where
a
huge
yellow
poster
,
probably
of
*NL*
some
outside
spectacle
,
such
as
a
parish
festival
,
was
fluttering
in
*NL*
the
wind
.
At
one
corner
of
the
inn
,
beside
a
pool
in
which
a
flotilla
*NL*
of
ducks
was
navigating
,
a
badly
paved
path
plunged
into
the
bushes
.
The
*NL*
wayfarer
struck
into
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
traversing
a
hundred
paces
,
skirting
a
wall
of
the
fifteenth
*NL*
century
,
surmounted
by
a
pointed
gable
,
with
bricks
set
in
contrast
,
he
*NL*
found
himself
before
a
large
door
of
arched
stone
,
with
a
rectilinear
*NL*
impost
,
in
the
sombre
style
of
Louis
XIV.
,
flanked
by
two
flat
*NL*
medallions
.
A
severe
facade
rose
above
this
door
;
a
wall
,
perpendicular
*NL*
to
the
facade
,
almost
touched
the
door
,
and
flanked
it
with
an
abrupt
*NL*
right
angle
.
In
the
meadow
before
the
door
lay
three
harrows
,
through
*NL*
which
,
in
disorder
,
grew
all
the
flowers
of
May
.
The
door
was
closed
.
*NL*
The
two
decrepit
leaves
which
barred
it
were
ornamented
with
an
old
*NL*
rusty
knocker
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
charming
;
the
branches
had
that
soft
shivering
of
May
,
*NL*
which
seems
to
proceed
rather
from
the
nests
than
from
the
wind
.
A
brave
*NL*
little
bird
,
probably
a
lover
,
was
carolling
in
a
distracted
manner
in
a
*NL*
large
tree
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wayfarer
bent
over
and
examined
a
rather
large
circular
excavation
,
*NL*
resembling
the
hollow
of
a
sphere
,
in
the
stone
on
the
left
,
at
the
foot
*NL*
of
the
pier
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
leaves
of
the
door
parted
,
and
a
peasant
woman
*NL*
emerged
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
wayfarer
,
and
perceived
what
he
was
looking
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
French
cannon-ball
which
made
that
,
''
she
said
to
him
.
And
she
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
which
you
see
there
,
higher
up
in
the
door
,
near
a
nail
,
is
the
*NL*
hole
of
a
big
iron
bullet
as
large
as
an
egg
.
The
bullet
did
not
pierce
*NL*
the
wood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
name
of
this
place
?
''
inquired
the
wayfarer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hougomont
,
''
said
the
peasant
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
straightened
himself
up
.
He
walked
on
a
few
paces
,
and
*NL*
went
off
to
look
over
the
tops
of
the
hedges
.
On
the
horizon
through
the
*NL*
trees
,
he
perceived
a
sort
of
little
elevation
,
and
on
this
elevation
*NL*
something
which
at
that
distance
resembled
a
lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
battle-field
of
Waterloo
.

CHAPTER
II
--
HOUGOMONT
*NL*
*NL*
Hougomont
,
--
this
was
a
funereal
spot
,
the
beginning
of
the
obstacle
,
*NL*
the
first
resistance
,
which
that
great
wood-cutter
of
Europe
,
called
*NL*
Napoleon
,
encountered
at
Waterloo
,
the
first
knot
under
the
blows
of
his
*NL*
axe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
chateau
;
it
is
no
longer
anything
but
a
farm
.
For
the
*NL*
antiquary
,
Hougomont
is
Hugomons
.
This
manor
was
built
by
Hugo
,
Sire
*NL*
of
Somerel
,
the
same
who
endowed
the
sixth
chaplaincy
of
the
Abbey
of
*NL*
Villiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
pushed
open
the
door
,
elbowed
an
ancient
calash
under
the
*NL*
porch
,
and
entered
the
courtyard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
which
struck
him
in
this
paddock
was
a
door
of
the
*NL*
sixteenth
century
,
which
here
simulates
an
arcade
,
everything
else
*NL*
having
fallen
prostrate
around
it
.
A
monumental
aspect
often
has
its
*NL*
birth
in
ruin
.
In
a
wall
near
the
arcade
opens
another
arched
door
,
of
*NL*
the
time
of
Henry
IV.
,
permitting
a
glimpse
of
the
trees
of
an
orchard
;
*NL*
beside
this
door
,
a
manure-hole
,
some
pickaxes
,
some
shovels
,
some
*NL*
carts
,
an
old
well
,
with
its
flagstone
and
its
iron
reel
,
a
chicken
*NL*
jumping
,
and
a
turkey
spreading
its
tail
,
a
chapel
surmounted
by
a
small
*NL*
bell-tower
,
a
blossoming
pear-tree
trained
in
espalier
against
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
chapel
--
behold
the
court
,
the
conquest
of
which
was
one
of
*NL*
Napoleon
's
dreams
.
This
corner
of
earth
,
could
he
but
have
seized
*NL*
it
,
would
,
perhaps
,
have
given
him
the
world
likewise
.
Chickens
are
*NL*
scattering
its
dust
abroad
with
their
beaks
.
A
growl
is
audible
;
it
is
a
*NL*
huge
dog
,
who
shows
his
teeth
and
replaces
the
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
English
behaved
admirably
there
.
Cooke
's
four
companies
of
guards
*NL*
there
held
out
for
seven
hours
against
the
fury
of
an
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hougomont
viewed
on
the
map
,
as
a
geometrical
plan
,
comprising
buildings
*NL*
and
enclosures
,
presents
a
sort
of
irregular
rectangle
,
one
angle
of
*NL*
which
is
nicked
out
.
It
is
this
angle
which
contains
the
southern
*NL*
door
,
guarded
by
this
wall
,
which
commands
it
only
a
gun
's
length
away
.
*NL*
Hougomont
has
two
doors
,
--
the
southern
door
,
that
of
the
chateau
;
and
*NL*
the
northern
door
,
belonging
to
the
farm
.
Napoleon
sent
his
brother
*NL*
Jerome
against
Hougomont
;
the
divisions
of
Foy
,
Guilleminot
,
and
Bachelu
*NL*
hurled
themselves
against
it
;
nearly
the
entire
corps
of
Reille
was
*NL*
employed
against
it
,
and
miscarried
;
Kellermann
's
balls
were
exhausted
*NL*
on
this
heroic
section
of
wall
.
Bauduin
's
brigade
was
not
strong
enough
*NL*
to
force
Hougomont
on
the
north
,
and
the
brigade
of
Soye
could
not
do
*NL*
more
than
effect
the
beginning
of
a
breach
on
the
south
,
but
without
*NL*
taking
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farm
buildings
border
the
courtyard
on
the
south
.
A
bit
of
the
north
*NL*
door
,
broken
by
the
French
,
hangs
suspended
to
the
wall
.
It
consists
of
*NL*
four
planks
nailed
to
two
cross-beams
,
on
which
the
scars
of
the
attack
*NL*
are
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
northern
door
,
which
was
beaten
in
by
the
French
,
and
which
has
had
*NL*
a
piece
applied
to
it
to
replace
the
panel
suspended
on
the
wall
,
stands
*NL*
half-open
at
the
bottom
of
the
paddock
;
it
is
cut
squarely
in
the
wall
,
*NL*
built
of
stone
below
,
of
brick
above
which
closes
in
the
courtyard
on
*NL*
the
north
.
It
is
a
simple
door
for
carts
,
such
as
exist
in
all
farms
,
*NL*
with
the
two
large
leaves
made
of
rustic
planks
:
beyond
lie
the
meadows
.
*NL*
The
dispute
over
this
entrance
was
furious
.
For
a
long
time
,
all
sorts
*NL*
of
imprints
of
bloody
hands
were
visible
on
the
door-posts
.
It
was
there
*NL*
that
Bauduin
was
killed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
storm
of
the
combat
still
lingers
in
this
courtyard
;
its
horror
is
*NL*
visible
there
;
the
confusion
of
the
fray
was
petrified
there
;
it
lives
*NL*
and
it
dies
there
;
it
was
only
yesterday
.
The
walls
are
in
the
death
*NL*
agony
,
the
stones
fall
;
the
breaches
cry
aloud
;
the
holes
are
wounds
;
*NL*
the
drooping
,
quivering
trees
seem
to
be
making
an
effort
to
flee
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
courtyard
was
more
built
up
in
1815
than
it
is
to-day
.
Buildings
*NL*
which
have
since
been
pulled
down
then
formed
redans
and
angles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
English
barricaded
themselves
there
;
the
French
made
their
way
in
,
*NL*
but
could
not
stand
their
ground
.
Beside
the
chapel
,
one
wing
of
the
*NL*
chateau
,
the
only
ruin
now
remaining
of
the
manor
of
Hougomont
,
rises
in
*NL*
a
crumbling
state
,
--
disembowelled
,
one
might
say
.
The
chateau
served
*NL*
for
a
dungeon
,
the
chapel
for
a
block-house
.
There
men
exterminated
each
*NL*
other
.
The
French
,
fired
on
from
every
point
,
--
from
behind
the
walls
,
*NL*
from
the
summits
of
the
garrets
,
from
the
depths
of
the
cellars
,
through
*NL*
all
the
casements
,
through
all
the
air-holes
,
through
every
crack
in
the
*NL*
stones
,
--
fetched
fagots
and
set
fire
to
walls
and
men
;
the
reply
to
the
*NL*
grape-shot
was
a
conflagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
ruined
wing
,
through
windows
garnished
with
bars
of
iron
,
the
*NL*
dismantled
chambers
of
the
main
building
of
brick
are
visible
;
the
*NL*
English
guards
were
in
ambush
in
these
rooms
;
the
spiral
of
the
*NL*
staircase
,
cracked
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
very
roof
,
appears
*NL*
like
the
inside
of
a
broken
shell
.
The
staircase
has
two
stories
;
the
*NL*
English
,
besieged
on
the
staircase
,
and
massed
on
its
upper
steps
,
had
*NL*
cut
off
the
lower
steps
.
These
consisted
of
large
slabs
of
blue
stone
,
*NL*
which
form
a
heap
among
the
nettles
.
Half
a
score
of
steps
still
*NL*
cling
to
the
wall
;
on
the
first
is
cut
the
figure
of
a
trident
.
These
*NL*
inaccessible
steps
are
solid
in
their
niches
.
All
the
rest
resembles
a
*NL*
jaw
which
has
been
denuded
of
its
teeth
.
There
are
two
old
trees
there
:
*NL*
one
is
dead
;
the
other
is
wounded
at
its
base
,
and
is
clothed
with
*NL*
verdure
in
April
.
Since
1815
it
has
taken
to
growing
through
the
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
massacre
took
place
in
the
chapel
.
The
interior
,
which
has
recovered
*NL*
its
calm
,
is
singular
.
The
mass
has
not
been
said
there
since
the
*NL*
carnage
.
Nevertheless
,
the
altar
has
been
left
there
--
an
altar
of
*NL*
unpolished
wood
,
placed
against
a
background
of
roughhewn
stone
.
Four
*NL*
whitewashed
walls
,
a
door
opposite
the
altar
,
two
small
arched
windows
;
*NL*
over
the
door
a
large
wooden
crucifix
,
below
the
crucifix
a
square
*NL*
air-hole
stopped
up
with
a
bundle
of
hay
;
on
the
ground
,
in
one
corner
,
*NL*
an
old
window-frame
with
the
glass
all
broken
to
pieces
--
such
is
the
*NL*
chapel
.
Near
the
altar
there
is
nailed
up
a
wooden
statue
of
Saint
Anne
,
*NL*
of
the
fifteenth
century
;
the
head
of
the
infant
Jesus
has
been
carried
*NL*
off
by
a
large
ball
.
The
French
,
who
were
masters
of
the
chapel
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
and
were
then
dislodged
,
set
fire
to
it
.
The
flames
filled
this
*NL*
building
;
it
was
a
perfect
furnace
;
the
door
was
burned
,
the
floor
was
*NL*
burned
,
the
wooden
Christ
was
not
burned
.
The
fire
preyed
upon
his
*NL*
feet
,
of
which
only
the
blackened
stumps
are
now
to
be
seen
;
then
it
*NL*
stopped
,
--
a
miracle
,
according
to
the
assertion
of
the
people
of
the
*NL*
neighborhood
.
The
infant
Jesus
,
decapitated
,
was
less
fortunate
than
the
*NL*
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walls
are
covered
with
inscriptions
.
Near
the
feet
of
Christ
this
*NL*
name
is
to
be
read
:
Henquinez
.
Then
these
others
:
Conde
de
Rio
Maior
*NL*
Marques
y
Marquesa
de
Almagro
-LRB-
Habana
-RRB-
.
There
are
French
names
with
*NL*
exclamation
points
,
--
a
sign
of
wrath
.
The
wall
was
freshly
whitewashed
*NL*
in
1849
.
The
nations
insulted
each
other
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
door
of
this
chapel
that
the
corpse
was
picked
up
which
*NL*
held
an
axe
in
its
hand
;
this
corpse
was
Sub-Lieutenant
Legros
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
emerging
from
the
chapel
,
a
well
is
visible
on
the
left
.
There
are
*NL*
two
in
this
courtyard
.
One
inquires
,
Why
is
there
no
bucket
and
pulley
*NL*
to
this
?
It
is
because
water
is
no
longer
drawn
there
.
Why
is
water
not
*NL*
drawn
there
?
Because
it
is
full
of
skeletons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
person
who
drew
water
from
the
well
was
named
Guillaume
van
*NL*
Kylsom
.
He
was
a
peasant
who
lived
at
Hougomont
,
and
was
gardener
there
.
*NL*
On
the
18th
of
June
,
1815
,
his
family
fled
and
concealed
themselves
in
*NL*
the
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
forest
surrounding
the
Abbey
of
Villiers
sheltered
these
unfortunate
*NL*
people
who
had
been
scattered
abroad
,
for
many
days
and
nights
.
There
*NL*
are
at
this
day
certain
traces
recognizable
,
such
as
old
boles
of
burned
*NL*
trees
,
which
mark
the
site
of
these
poor
bivouacs
trembling
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
thickets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guillaume
van
Kylsom
remained
at
Hougomont
,
``
to
guard
the
chateau
,
''
and
*NL*
concealed
himself
in
the
cellar
.
The
English
discovered
him
there
.
*NL*
They
tore
him
from
his
hiding-place
,
and
the
combatants
forced
this
*NL*
frightened
man
to
serve
them
,
by
administering
blows
with
the
flats
of
*NL*
their
swords
.
They
were
thirsty
;
this
Guillaume
brought
them
water
.
It
*NL*
was
from
this
well
that
he
drew
it
.
Many
drank
there
their
last
draught
.
*NL*
This
well
where
drank
so
many
of
the
dead
was
destined
to
die
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
engagement
,
they
were
in
haste
to
bury
the
dead
bodies
.
Death
*NL*
has
a
fashion
of
harassing
victory
,
and
she
causes
the
pest
to
follow
*NL*
glory
.
The
typhus
is
a
concomitant
of
triumph
.
This
well
was
deep
,
and
*NL*
it
was
turned
into
a
sepulchre
.
Three
hundred
dead
bodies
were
cast
into
*NL*
it
.
With
too
much
haste
perhaps
.
Were
they
all
dead
?
Legend
says
they
*NL*
were
not
.
It
seems
that
on
the
night
succeeding
the
interment
,
feeble
*NL*
voices
were
heard
calling
from
the
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
well
is
isolated
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
.
Three
walls
,
part
*NL*
stone
,
part
brick
,
and
simulating
a
small
,
square
tower
,
and
folded
like
*NL*
the
leaves
of
a
screen
,
surround
it
on
all
sides
.
The
fourth
side
is
*NL*
open
.
It
is
there
that
the
water
was
drawn
.
The
wall
at
the
bottom
has
*NL*
a
sort
of
shapeless
loophole
,
possibly
the
hole
made
by
a
shell
.
This
*NL*
little
tower
had
a
platform
,
of
which
only
the
beams
remain
.
The
iron
*NL*
supports
of
the
well
on
the
right
form
a
cross
.
On
leaning
over
,
the
*NL*
eye
is
lost
in
a
deep
cylinder
of
brick
which
is
filled
with
a
heaped-up
*NL*
mass
of
shadows
.
The
base
of
the
walls
all
about
the
well
is
concealed
*NL*
in
a
growth
of
nettles
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
well
has
not
in
front
of
it
that
large
blue
slab
which
forms
the
*NL*
table
for
all
wells
in
Belgium
.
The
slab
has
here
been
replaced
by
a
*NL*
cross-beam
,
against
which
lean
five
or
six
shapeless
fragments
of
knotty
*NL*
and
petrified
wood
which
resemble
huge
bones
.
There
is
no
longer
either
*NL*
pail
,
chain
,
or
pulley
;
but
there
is
still
the
stone
basin
which
served
*NL*
the
overflow
.
The
rain-water
collects
there
,
and
from
time
to
time
a
*NL*
bird
of
the
neighboring
forests
comes
thither
to
drink
,
and
then
flies
*NL*
away
.
One
house
in
this
ruin
,
the
farmhouse
,
is
still
inhabited
.
The
*NL*
door
of
this
house
opens
on
the
courtyard
.
Upon
this
door
,
beside
a
*NL*
pretty
Gothic
lock-plate
,
there
is
an
iron
handle
with
trefoils
placed
*NL*
slanting
.
At
the
moment
when
the
Hanoverian
lieutenant
,
Wilda
,
grasped
*NL*
this
handle
in
order
to
take
refuge
in
the
farm
,
a
French
sapper
hewed
*NL*
off
his
hand
with
an
axe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
who
occupy
the
house
had
for
their
grandfather
Guillaume
van
*NL*
Kylsom
,
the
old
gardener
,
dead
long
since
.
A
woman
with
gray
hair
said
*NL*
to
us
:
``
I
was
there
.
I
was
three
years
old
.
My
sister
,
who
was
older
,
*NL*
was
terrified
and
wept
.
They
carried
us
off
to
the
woods
.
I
went
there
*NL*
in
my
mother
's
arms
.
We
glued
our
ears
to
the
earth
to
hear
.
I
imitated
*NL*
the
cannon
,
and
went
boum
!
boum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
door
opening
from
the
courtyard
on
the
left
led
into
the
orchard
,
so
*NL*
we
were
told
.
The
orchard
is
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
three
parts
;
one
might
almost
say
,
in
three
acts
.
The
first
*NL*
part
is
a
garden
,
the
second
is
an
orchard
,
the
third
is
a
wood
.
These
*NL*
three
parts
have
a
common
enclosure
:
on
the
side
of
the
entrance
,
the
*NL*
buildings
of
the
chateau
and
the
farm
;
on
the
left
,
a
hedge
;
on
the
*NL*
right
,
a
wall
;
and
at
the
end
,
a
wall
.
The
wall
on
the
right
is
of
*NL*
brick
,
the
wall
at
the
bottom
is
of
stone
.
One
enters
the
garden
first
.
*NL*
It
slopes
downwards
,
is
planted
with
gooseberry
bushes
,
choked
with
a
*NL*
wild
growth
of
vegetation
,
and
terminated
by
a
monumental
terrace
of
cut
*NL*
stone
,
with
balustrade
with
a
double
curve
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
seignorial
garden
in
the
first
French
style
which
preceded
Le
*NL*
Notre
;
to-day
it
is
ruins
and
briars
.
The
pilasters
are
surmounted
by
*NL*
globes
which
resemble
cannon-balls
of
stone
.
Forty-three
balusters
can
*NL*
still
be
counted
on
their
sockets
;
the
rest
lie
prostrate
in
the
grass
.
*NL*
Almost
all
bear
scratches
of
bullets
.
One
broken
baluster
is
placed
on
*NL*
the
pediment
like
a
fractured
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
this
garden
,
further
down
than
the
orchard
,
that
six
*NL*
light-infantry
men
of
the
1st
,
having
made
their
way
thither
,
and
being
*NL*
unable
to
escape
,
hunted
down
and
caught
like
bears
in
their
dens
,
*NL*
accepted
the
combat
with
two
Hanoverian
companies
,
one
of
which
was
*NL*
armed
with
carbines
.
The
Hanoverians
lined
this
balustrade
and
fired
*NL*
from
above
.
The
infantry
men
,
replying
from
below
,
six
against
two
*NL*
hundred
,
intrepid
and
with
no
shelter
save
the
currant-bushes
,
took
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
mounts
a
few
steps
and
passes
from
the
garden
into
the
orchard
,
*NL*
properly
speaking
.
There
,
within
the
limits
of
those
few
square
fathoms
,
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
men
fell
in
less
than
an
hour
.
The
wall
seems
ready
*NL*
to
renew
the
combat
.
Thirty-eight
loopholes
,
pierced
by
the
English
at
*NL*
irregular
heights
,
are
there
still
.
In
front
of
the
sixth
are
placed
two
*NL*
English
tombs
of
granite
.
There
are
loopholes
only
in
the
south
wall
,
as
*NL*
the
principal
attack
came
from
that
quarter
.
The
wall
is
hidden
on
the
*NL*
outside
by
a
tall
hedge
;
the
French
came
up
,
thinking
that
they
had
to
*NL*
deal
only
with
a
hedge
,
crossed
it
,
and
found
the
wall
both
an
obstacle
*NL*
and
an
ambuscade
,
with
the
English
guards
behind
it
,
the
thirty-eight
*NL*
loopholes
firing
at
once
a
shower
of
grape-shot
and
balls
,
and
Soye
's
*NL*
brigade
was
broken
against
it
.
Thus
Waterloo
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
orchard
was
taken
.
As
they
had
no
ladders
,
the
French
*NL*
scaled
it
with
their
nails
.
They
fought
hand
to
hand
amid
the
trees
.
*NL*
All
this
grass
has
been
soaked
in
blood
.
A
battalion
of
Nassau
,
seven
*NL*
hundred
strong
,
was
overwhelmed
there
.
The
outside
of
the
wall
,
against
*NL*
which
Kellermann
's
two
batteries
were
trained
,
is
gnawed
by
grape-shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
orchard
is
sentient
,
like
others
,
in
the
month
of
May
.
It
has
its
*NL*
buttercups
and
its
daisies
;
the
grass
is
tall
there
;
the
cart-horses
*NL*
browse
there
;
cords
of
hair
,
on
which
linen
is
drying
,
traverse
the
*NL*
spaces
between
the
trees
and
force
the
passer-by
to
bend
his
head
;
one
*NL*
walks
over
this
uncultivated
land
,
and
one
's
foot
dives
into
mole-holes
.
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
grass
one
observes
an
uprooted
tree-bole
which
lies
*NL*
there
all
verdant
.
Major
Blackmann
leaned
against
it
to
die
.
Beneath
*NL*
a
great
tree
in
the
neighborhood
fell
the
German
general
,
Duplat
,
*NL*
descended
from
a
French
family
which
fled
on
the
revocation
of
the
Edict
*NL*
of
Nantes
.
An
aged
and
falling
apple-tree
leans
far
over
to
one
side
,
*NL*
its
wound
dressed
with
a
bandage
of
straw
and
of
clayey
loam
.
Nearly
all
*NL*
the
apple-trees
are
falling
with
age
.
There
is
not
one
which
has
not
*NL*
had
its
bullet
or
its
biscayan
.

The
skeletons
of
dead
trees
abound
in
*NL*
this
orchard
.
Crows
fly
through
their

at

a

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
EIGHTEENTH
OF
JUNE
,
1815
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
turn
back
,
--
that
is
one
of
the
story-teller
's
rights
,
--
and
put
*NL*
ourselves
once
more
in
the
year
1815
,
and
even
a
little
earlier
than
*NL*
the
epoch
when
the
action
narrated
in
the
first
part
of
this
book
took
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
not
rained
in
the
night
between
the
17th
and
the
18th
of
*NL*
June
,
1815
,
the
fate
of
Europe
would
have
been
different
.
A
few
drops
*NL*
of
water
,
more
or
less
,
decided
the
downfall
of
Napoleon
.
All
that
*NL*
Providence
required
in
order
to
make
Waterloo
the
end
of
Austerlitz
*NL*
was
a
little
more
rain
,
and
a
cloud
traversing
the
sky
out
of
season
*NL*
sufficed
to
make
a
world
crumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
of
Waterloo
could
not
be
begun
until
half-past
eleven
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
that
gave
Blucher
time
to
come
up
.
Why
?
Because
the
ground
*NL*
was
wet
.
The
artillery
had
to
wait
until
it
became
a
little
firmer
*NL*
before
they
could
manoeuvre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
was
an
artillery
officer
,
and
felt
the
effects
of
this
.
The
*NL*
foundation
of
this
wonderful
captain
was
the
man
who
,
in
the
report
to
*NL*
the
Directory
on
Aboukir
,
said
:
Such
a
one
of
our
balls
killed
six
men
.
*NL*
All
his
plans
of
battle
were
arranged
for
projectiles
.
The
key
to
his
*NL*
victory
was
to
make
the
artillery
converge
on
one
point
.
He
treated
the
*NL*
strategy
of
the
hostile
general
like
a
citadel
,
and
made
a
breach
in
it
.
*NL*
He
overwhelmed
the
weak
point
with
grape-shot
;
he
joined
and
dissolved
*NL*
battles
with
cannon
.
There
was
something
of
the
sharpshooter
in
his
*NL*
genius
.
To
beat
in
squares
,
to
pulverize
regiments
,
to
break
lines
,
to
*NL*
crush
and
disperse
masses
,
--
for
him
everything
lay
in
this
,
to
*NL*
strike
,
strike
,
strike
incessantly
,
--
and
he
intrusted
this
task
to
the
*NL*
cannon-ball
.
A
redoubtable
method
,
and
one
which
,
united
with
genius
,
*NL*
rendered
this
gloomy
athlete
of
the
pugilism
of
war
invincible
for
the
*NL*
space
of
fifteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
18th
of
June
,
1815
,
he
relied
all
the
more
on
his
artillery
,
*NL*
because
he
had
numbers
on
his
side
.
Wellington
had
only
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty-nine
mouths
of
fire
;
Napoleon
had
two
hundred
and
forty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suppose
the
soil
dry
,
and
the
artillery
capable
of
moving
,
the
action
*NL*
would
have
begun
at
six
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
The
battle
would
have
*NL*
been
won
and
ended
at
two
o'clock
,
three
hours
before
the
change
of
*NL*
fortune
in
favor
of
the
Prussians
.
What
amount
of
blame
attaches
to
*NL*
Napoleon
for
the
loss
of
this
battle
?
Is
the
shipwreck
due
to
the
pilot
?
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
the
evident
physical
decline
of
Napoleon
that
complicated
this
*NL*
epoch
by
an
inward
diminution
of
force
?
Had
the
twenty
years
of
war
worn
*NL*
out
the
blade
as
it
had
worn
the
scabbard
,
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
?
*NL*
Did
the
veteran
make
himself
disastrously
felt
in
the
leader
?
In
a
word
,
*NL*
was
this
genius
,
as
many
historians
of
note
have
thought
,
suffering
from
*NL*
an
eclipse
?
Did
he
go
into
a
frenzy
in
order
to
disguise
his
weakened
*NL*
powers
from
himself
?
Did
he
begin
to
waver
under
the
delusion
of
*NL*
a
breath
of
adventure
?
Had
he
become
--
a
grave
matter
in
a
*NL*
general
--
unconscious
of
peril
?
Is
there
an
age
,
in
this
class
of
*NL*
material
great
men
,
who
may
be
called
the
giants
of
action
,
when
genius
*NL*
grows
short-sighted
?
Old
age
has
no
hold
on
the
geniuses
of
the
ideal
;
*NL*
for
the
Dantes
and
Michael
Angelos
to
grow
old
is
to
grow
in
greatness
;
*NL*
is
it
to
grow
less
for
the
Hannibals
and
the
Bonapartes
?
Had
Napoleon
*NL*
lost
the
direct
sense
of
victory
?
Had
he
reached
the
point
where
he
*NL*
could
no
longer
recognize
the
reef
,
could
no
longer
divine
the
snare
,
no
*NL*
longer
discern
the
crumbling
brink
of
abysses
?
Had
he
lost
his
power
of
*NL*
scenting
out
catastrophes
?
He
who
had
in
former
days
known
all
the
*NL*
roads
to
triumph
,
and
who
,
from
the
summit
of
his
chariot
of
lightning
,
*NL*
pointed
them
out
with
a
sovereign
finger
,
had
he
now
reached
that
*NL*
state
of
sinister
amazement
when
he
could
lead
his
tumultuous
legions
*NL*
harnessed
to
it
,
to
the
precipice
?
Was
he
seized
at
the
age
of
forty-six
*NL*
with
a
supreme
madness
?
Was
that
titanic
charioteer
of
destiny
no
longer
*NL*
anything
more
than
an
immense
dare-devil
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
do
not
think
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
plan
of
battle
was
,
by
the
confession
of
all
,
a
masterpiece
.
To
*NL*
go
straight
to
the
centre
of
the
Allies
'
line
,
to
make
a
breach
in
the
*NL*
enemy
,
to
cut
them
in
two
,
to
drive
the
British
half
back
on
Hal
,
*NL*
and
the
Prussian
half
on
Tongres
,
to
make
two
shattered
fragments
of
*NL*
Wellington
and
Blucher
,
to
carry
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
to
seize
Brussels
,
*NL*
to
hurl
the
German
into
the
Rhine
,
and
the
Englishman
into
the
sea
.
All
*NL*
this
was
contained
in
that
battle
,
according
to
Napoleon
.
Afterwards
*NL*
people
would
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
,
we
do
not
here
pretend
to
furnish
a
history
of
the
battle
of
*NL*
Waterloo
;
one
of
the
scenes
of
the
foundation
of
the
story
which
we
*NL*
are
relating
is
connected
with
this
battle
,
but
this
history
is
not
our
*NL*
subject
;
this
history
,
moreover
,
has
been
finished
,
and
finished
in
a
*NL*
masterly
manner
,
from
one
point
of
view
by
Napoleon
,
and
from
another
*NL*
point
of
view
by
a
whole
pleiad
of
historians
.

*NL*
As
for
us
,
we
leave
the
historians
at
loggerheads
;
we
are
but
a
distant

,
a
passer-by

a

bending
over

we

have
no

in

*NL*
which
contain

no

we

neither

in

a
chain
*NL*
of
accidents
dominated
the
two
leaders
at
Waterloo
;
and
when
it
becomes
*NL*
a

CHAPTER
IV
--
A
*NL*
*NL*
Those
persons
who
wish
to
gain
a
clear
idea
of
the
battle
of
Waterloo
*NL*
have
only
to
place
,
mentally
,
on
the
ground
,
a
capital
A
.
The
left
limb
*NL*
of
the
A
is
the
road
to
Nivelles
,
the
right
limb
is
the
road
to
Genappe
,
*NL*
the
tie
of
the
A
is
the
hollow
road
to
Ohain
from
Braine-l'Alleud
.
The
*NL*
top
of
the
A
is
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
where
Wellington
is
;
the
lower
left
tip
*NL*
is
Hougomont
,
where
Reille
is
stationed
with
Jerome
Bonaparte
;
the
right
*NL*
tip
is
the
Belle-Alliance
,
where
Napoleon
was
.
At
the
centre
of
this
*NL*
chord
is
the
precise
point
where
the
final
word
of
the
battle
was
*NL*
pronounced
.
It
was
there
that
the
lion
has
been
placed
,
the
involuntary
*NL*
symbol
of
the
supreme
heroism
of
the
Imperial
Guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
triangle
included
in
the
top
of
the
A
,
between
the
two
limbs
and
the
*NL*
tie
,
is
the
plateau
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
.
The
dispute
over
this
plateau
*NL*
constituted
the
whole
battle
.
The
wings
of
the
two
armies
extended
to
*NL*
the
right
and
left
of
the
two
roads
to
Genappe
and
Nivelles
;
d'Erlon
*NL*
facing
Picton
,
Reille
facing
Hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
tip
of
the
A
,
behind
the
plateau
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
is
the
*NL*
forest
of
Soignes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
plain
itself
,
let
the
reader
picture
to
himself
a
vast
*NL*
undulating
sweep
of
ground
;
each
rise
commands
the
next
rise
,
and
all
*NL*
the
undulations
mount
towards
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
and
there
end
in
the
*NL*
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
hostile
troops
on
a
field
of
battle
are
two
wrestlers
.
It
is
a
*NL*
question
of
seizing
the
opponent
round
the
waist
.
The
one
seeks
to
trip
*NL*
up
the
other
.
They
clutch
at
everything
:
a
bush
is
a
point
of
support
;
*NL*
an
angle
of
the
wall
offers
them
a
rest
to
the
shoulder
;
for
the
lack
*NL*
of
a
hovel
under
whose
cover
they
can
draw
up
,
a
regiment
yields
its
*NL*
ground
;
an
unevenness
in
the
ground
,
a
chance
turn
in
the
landscape
,
a
*NL*
cross-path
encountered
at
the
right
moment
,
a
grove
,
a
ravine
,
can
*NL*
stay
the
heel
of
that
colossus
which
is
called
an
army
,
and
prevent
its
*NL*
retreat
.
He
who
quits
the
field
is
beaten
;
hence
the
necessity
devolving
*NL*
on
the
responsible
leader
,
of
examining
the
most
insignificant
clump
of
*NL*
trees
,
and
of
studying
deeply
the
slightest
relief
in
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
generals
had
attentively
studied
the
plain
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
*NL*
now
called
the
plain
of
Waterloo
.
In
the
preceding
year
,
Wellington
,
*NL*
with
the
sagacity
of
foresight
,
had
examined
it
as
the
possible
seat
of
*NL*
a
great
battle
.
Upon
this
spot
,
and
for
this
duel
,
on
the
18th
of
June
,
*NL*
Wellington
had
the
good
post
,
Napoleon
the
bad
post
.
The
English
army
*NL*
was
stationed
above
,
the
French
army
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
almost
superfluous
here
to
sketch
the
appearance
of
Napoleon
on
*NL*
horseback
,
glass
in
hand
,
upon
the
heights
of
Rossomme
,
at
daybreak
,
on
*NL*
June
18
,
1815
.
All
the
world
has
seen
him
before
we
can
show
him
.
*NL*
That
calm
profile
under
the
little
three-cornered
hat
of
the
school
of
*NL*
Brienne
,
that
green
uniform
,
the
white
revers
concealing
the
star
of
the
*NL*
Legion
of
Honor
,
his
great
coat
hiding
his
epaulets
,
the
corner
of
red
*NL*
ribbon
peeping
from
beneath
his
vest
,
his
leather
trousers
,
the
white
*NL*
horse
with
the
saddle-cloth
of
purple
velvet
bearing
on
the
corners
*NL*
crowned
N
's
and
eagles
,
Hessian
boots
over
silk
stockings
,
silver
spurs
,
*NL*
the
sword
of
Marengo
,
--
that
whole
figure
of
the
last
of
the
Caesars
is
*NL*
present
to
all
imaginations
,
saluted
with
acclamations
by
some
,
severely
*NL*
regarded
by
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
figure
stood
for
a
long
time
wholly
in
the
light
;
this
arose
from
*NL*
a
certain
legendary
dimness
evolved
by
the
majority
of
heroes
,
and
which
*NL*
always
veils
the
truth
for
a
longer
or
shorter
time
;
but
to-day
history
*NL*
and
daylight
have
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
light
called
history
is
pitiless
;
it
possesses
this
peculiar
and
*NL*
divine
quality
,
that
,
pure
light
as
it
is
,
and
precisely
because
it
*NL*
is
wholly
light
,
it
often
casts
a
shadow
in
places
where
people
had
*NL*
hitherto
beheld
rays
;
from
the
same
man
it
constructs
two
different
*NL*
phantoms
,
and
the
one
attacks
the
other
and
executes
justice
on
it
,
and
*NL*
the
shadows
of
the
despot
contend
with
the
brilliancy
of
the
leader
.
*NL*
Hence
arises
a
truer
measure
in
the
definitive
judgments
of
nations
.
*NL*
Babylon
violated
lessens
Alexander
,
Rome
enchained
lessens
Caesar
,
*NL*
Jerusalem
murdered
lessens
Titus
,
tyranny
follows
the
tyrant
.
It
is
a
*NL*
misfortune
for
a
man
to
leave
behind
him
the
night
which
bears
his
form
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
QUID
OBSCURUM
OF
BATTLES
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
is
acquainted
with
the
first
phase
of
this
battle
;
a
beginning
*NL*
which
was
troubled
,
uncertain
,
hesitating
,
menacing
to
both
armies
,
but
*NL*
still
more
so
for
the
English
than
for
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
rained
all
night
,
the
earth
had
been
cut
up
by
the
downpour
,
the
*NL*
water
had
accumulated
here
and
there
in
the
hollows
of
the
plain
as
if
*NL*
in
casks
;
at
some
points
the
gear
of
the
artillery
carriages
was
buried
*NL*
up
to
the
axles
,
the
circingles
of
the
horses
were
dripping
with
liquid
*NL*
mud
.
If
the
wheat
and
rye
trampled
down
by
this
cohort
of
transports
*NL*
on
the
march
had
not
filled
in
the
ruts
and
strewn
a
litter
beneath
the
*NL*
wheels
,
all
movement
,
particularly
in
the
valleys
,
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Papelotte
would
have
been
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affair
began
late
.
Napoleon
,
as
we
have
already
explained
,
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
keeping
all
his
artillery
well
in
hand
,
like
a
pistol
,
*NL*
aiming
it
now
at
one
point
,
now
at
another
,
of
the
battle
;
and
it
had
*NL*
been
his
wish
to
wait
until
the
horse
batteries
could
move
and
gallop
*NL*
freely
.
In
order
to
do
that
it
was
necessary
that
the
sun
should
come
*NL*
out
and
dry
the
soil
.
But
the
sun
did
not
make
its
appearance
.
It
was
*NL*
no
longer
the
rendezvous
of
Austerlitz
.
When
the
first
cannon
was
fired
,
*NL*
the
English
general
,
Colville
,
looked
at
his
watch
,
and
noted
that
it
*NL*
was
thirty-five
minutes
past
eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
action
was
begun
furiously
,
with
more
fury
,
perhaps
,
than
the
*NL*
Emperor
would
have
wished
,
by
the
left
wing
of
the
French
resting
on
*NL*
Hougomont
.
At
the
same
time
Napoleon
attacked
the
centre
by
hurling
*NL*
Quiot
's
brigade
on
La
Haie-Sainte
,
and
Ney
pushed
forward
the
right
*NL*
wing
of
the
French
against
the
left
wing
of
the
English
,
which
rested
on
*NL*
Papelotte
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attack
on
Hougomont
was
something
of
a
feint
;
the
plan
was
to
draw
*NL*
Wellington
thither
,
and
to
make
him
swerve
to
the
left
.
This
plan
would
*NL*
have
succeeded
if
the
four
companies
of
the
English
guards
and
the
brave
*NL*
Belgians
of
Perponcher
's
division
had
not
held
the
position
solidly
,
and
*NL*
Wellington
,
instead
of
massing
his
troops
there
,
could
confine
himself
*NL*
to
despatching
thither
,
as
reinforcements
,
only
four
more
companies
of
*NL*
guards
and
one
battalion
from
Brunswick
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attack
of
the
right
wing
of
the
French
on
Papelotte
was
calculated
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
to
overthrow
the
English
left
,
to
cut
off
the
road
to
Brussels
,
*NL*
to
bar
the
passage
against
possible
Prussians
,
to
force
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
*NL*
to
turn
Wellington
back
on
Hougomont
,
thence
on
Braine-l'Alleud
,
thence
*NL*
on
Hal
;
nothing
easier
.
With
the
exception
of
a
few
incidents
this
*NL*
attack
succeeded
Papelotte
was
taken
;
La
Haie-Sainte
was
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
detail
to
be
noted
.
There
was
in
the
English
infantry
,
particularly
*NL*
in
Kempt
's
brigade
,
a
great
many
raw
recruits
.
These
young
soldiers
were
*NL*
valiant
in
the
presence
of
our
redoubtable
infantry
;
their
inexperience
*NL*
extricated
them
intrepidly
from
the
dilemma
;
they
performed
particularly
*NL*
excellent
service
as
skirmishers
:
the
soldier
skirmisher
,
left
somewhat
*NL*
to
himself
,
becomes
,
so
to
speak
,
his
own
general
.
These
recruits
*NL*
displayed
some
of
the
French
ingenuity
and
fury
.
This
novice
of
an
*NL*
infantry
had
dash
.
This
displeased
Wellington
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
taking
of
La
Haie-Sainte
the
battle
wavered
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
in
this
day
an
obscure
interval
,
from
mid-day
to
four
o'clock
;
*NL*
the
middle
portion
of
this
battle
is
almost
indistinct
,
and
participates
*NL*
in
the
sombreness
of
the
hand-to-hand
conflict
.
Twilight
reigns
over
it
.
*NL*
We
perceive
vast
fluctuations
in
that
fog
,
a
dizzy
mirage
,
paraphernalia
*NL*
of
war
almost
unknown
to-day
,
pendant
colbacks
,
floating
sabre-taches
,
*NL*
cross-belts
,
cartridge-boxes
for
grenades
,
hussar
dolmans
,
red
boots
*NL*
with
a
thousand
wrinkles
,
heavy
shakos
garlanded
with
torsades
,
the
*NL*
almost
black
infantry
of
Brunswick
mingled
with
the
scarlet
infantry
*NL*
of
England
,
the
English
soldiers
with
great
,
white
circular
pads
on
the
*NL*
slopes
of
their
shoulders
for
epaulets
,
the
Hanoverian
light-horse
with
*NL*
their
oblong
casques
of
leather
,
with
brass
hands
and
red
horse-tails
,
*NL*
the
Scotch
with
their
bare
knees
and
plaids
,
the
great
white
gaiters
*NL*
of
our
grenadiers
;
pictures
,
not
strategic
lines
--
what
Salvator
Rosa
*NL*
requires
,
not
what
is
suited
to
the
needs
of
Gribeauval
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
amount
of
tempest
is
always
mingled
with
a
battle
.
Quid
*NL*
obscurum
,
quid
divinum
.
Each
historian
traces
,
to
some
extent
,
the
*NL*
particular
feature
which
pleases
him
amid
this
pell-mell
.
Whatever
may
*NL*
be
the
combinations
of
the
generals
,
the
shock
of
armed
masses
has
an
*NL*
incalculable
ebb
.
During
the
action
the
plans
of
the
two
leaders
enter
*NL*
into
each
other
and
become
mutually
thrown
out
of
shape
.
Such
a
point
of
*NL*
the
field
of
battle
devours
more
combatants
than
such
another
,
just
as
*NL*
more
or
less
spongy
soils
soak
up
more
or
less
quickly
the
water
which
*NL*
is
poured
on
them
.
It
becomes
necessary
to
pour
out
more
soldiers
than
*NL*
one
would
like
;
a
series
of
expenditures
which
are
the
unforeseen
.
The
*NL*
line
of
battle
waves
and
undulates
like
a
thread
,
the
trails
of
blood
*NL*
gush
illogically
,
the
fronts
of
the
armies
waver
,
the
regiments
*NL*
form
capes
and
gulfs
as
they
enter
and
withdraw
;
all
these
reefs
are
*NL*
continually
moving
in
front
of
each
other
.
Where
the
infantry
stood
the
*NL*
artillery
arrives
,
the
cavalry
rushes
in
where
the
artillery
was
,
the
*NL*
battalions
are
like
smoke
.
There
was
something
there
;
seek
it
.
It
has
*NL*
disappeared
;
the
open
spots
change
place
,
the
sombre
folds
advance
and
*NL*
retreat
,
a
sort
of
wind
from
the
sepulchre
pushes
forward
,
hurls
back
,
*NL*
distends
,
and
disperses
these
tragic
multitudes
.
What
is
a
fray
?
an
*NL*
oscillation
?
The
immobility
of
a
mathematical
plan
expresses
a
minute
,
*NL*
not
a
day
.
In
order
to
depict
a
battle
,
there
is
required
one
of
those
*NL*
powerful
painters
who
have
chaos
in
their
brushes
.
Rembrandt
is
better
*NL*
than
Vandermeulen
;
Vandermeulen
,
exact
at
noon
,
lies
at
three
o'clock
.
*NL*
Geometry
is
deceptive
;
the
hurricane
alone
is
trustworthy
.
That
is
what
*NL*
confers
on
Folard
the
right
to
contradict
Polybius
.
Let
us
add
,
that
*NL*
there
is
a
certain
instant
when
the
battle
degenerates
into
a
combat
,
*NL*
becomes
specialized
,
and
disperses
into
innumerable
detailed
feats
,
*NL*
which
,
to
borrow
the
expression
of
Napoleon
himself
,
``
belong
rather
to
*NL*
the
biography
of
the
regiments
than
to
the
history
of
the
army
.
''
The
*NL*
historian
has
,
in
this
case
,
the
evident
right
to
sum
up
the
whole
.
He
*NL*
can
not
do
more
than
seize
the
principal
outlines
of
the
struggle
,
and
*NL*
it
is
not
given
to
any
one
narrator
,
however
conscientious
he
may
be
,
*NL*
to
fix
,
absolutely
,
the
form
of
that
horrible
cloud
which
is
called
a
*NL*
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
which
is
true
of
all
great
armed
encounters
,
is
particularly
*NL*
applicable
to
Waterloo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
at
a
certain
moment
in
the
afternoon
the
battle
came
to
a
*NL*
point
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
FOUR
O'CLOCK
IN
THE
AFTERNOON
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
four
o'clock
the
condition
of
the
English
army
was
serious
.
The
*NL*
Prince
of
Orange
was
in
command
of
the
centre
,
Hill
of
the
right
wing
,
*NL*
Picton
of
the
left
wing
.
The
Prince
of
Orange
,
desperate
and
intrepid
,
*NL*
shouted
to
the
Hollando-Belgians
:
``
Nassau
!
Brunswick
!
Never
retreat
!
''
*NL*
Hill
,
having
been
weakened
,
had
come
up
to
the
support
of
Wellington
;
*NL*
Picton
was
dead
.
At
the
very
moment
when
the
English
had
captured
from
*NL*
the
French
the
flag
of
the
105th
of
the
line
,
the
French
had
killed
the
*NL*
English
general
,
Picton
,
with
a
bullet
through
the
head
.
The
battle
*NL*
had
,
for
Wellington
,
two
bases
of
action
,
Hougomont
and
La
Haie-Sainte
;
*NL*
Hougomont
still
held
out
,
but
was
on
fire
;
La
Haie-Sainte
was
taken
.
Of
*NL*
the
German
battalion
which
defended
it
,
only
forty-two
men
survived
;
all
*NL*
the
officers
,
except
five
,
were
either
dead
or
captured
.
Three
thousand
*NL*
combatants
had
been
massacred
in
that
barn
.
A
sergeant
of
the
English
*NL*
Guards
,
the
foremost
boxer
in
England
,
reputed
invulnerable
by
his
*NL*
companions
,
had
been
killed
there
by
a
little
French
drummer-boy
.
Baring
*NL*
had
been
dislodged
,
Alten
put
to
the
sword
.
Many
flags
had
been
lost
,
*NL*
one
from
Alten
's
division
,
and
one
from
the
battalion
of
Lunenburg
,
*NL*
carried
by
a
prince
of
the
house
of
Deux-Ponts
.
The
Scotch
Grays
no
*NL*
longer
existed
;
Ponsonby
's
great
dragoons
had
been
hacked
to
pieces
.
*NL*
That
valiant
cavalry
had
bent
beneath
the
lancers
of
Bro
and
beneath
*NL*
the
cuirassiers
of
Travers
;
out
of
twelve
hundred
horses
,
six
*NL*
hundred
remained
;
out
of
three
lieutenant-colonels
,
two
lay
on
the
*NL*
earth
,
--
Hamilton
wounded
,
Mater
slain
.
Ponsonby
had
fallen
,
riddled
by
*NL*
seven
lance-thrusts
.
Gordon
was
dead
.
Marsh
was
dead
.
Two
divisions
,
the
*NL*
fifth
and
the
sixth
,
had
been
annihilated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hougomont
injured
,
La
Haie-Sainte
taken
,
there
now
existed
but
one
*NL*
rallying-point
,
the
centre
.
That
point
still
held
firm
.
Wellington
*NL*
reinforced
it
.
He
summoned
thither
Hill
,
who
was
at
Merle-Braine
;
he
*NL*
summoned
Chasse
,
who
was
at
Braine-l'Alleud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
centre
of
the
English
army
,
rather
concave
,
very
dense
,
and
*NL*
very
compact
,
was
strongly
posted
.
It
occupied
the
plateau
of
*NL*
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
having
behind
it
the
village
,
and
in
front
of
it
the
*NL*
slope
,
which
was
tolerably
steep
then
.
It
rested
on
that
stout
stone
*NL*
dwelling
which
at
that
time
belonged
to
the
domain
of
Nivelles
,
and
*NL*
which
marks
the
intersection
of
the
roads
--
a
pile
of
the
sixteenth
*NL*
century
,
and
so
robust
that
the
cannon-balls
rebounded
from
it
without
*NL*
injuring
it
.
All
about
the
plateau
the
English
had
cut
the
hedges
here
*NL*
and
there
,
made
embrasures
in
the
hawthorn-trees
,
thrust
the
throat
of
*NL*
a
cannon
between
two
branches
,
embattled
the
shrubs
.
There
artillery
was
*NL*
ambushed
in
the
brushwood
.
This
punic
labor
,
incontestably
authorized
*NL*
by
war
,
which
permits
traps
,
was
so
well
done
,
that
Haxo
,
who
had
been
*NL*
despatched
by
the
Emperor
at
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
to
reconnoitre
*NL*
the
enemy
's
batteries
,
had
discovered
nothing
of
it
,
and
had
returned
*NL*
and
reported
to
Napoleon
that
there
were
no
obstacles
except
the
two
*NL*
barricades
which
barred
the
road
to
Nivelles
and
to
Genappe
.
It
was
*NL*
at
the
season
when
the
grain
is
tall
;
on
the
edge
of
the
plateau
a
*NL*
battalion
of
Kempt
's
brigade
,
the
95th
,
armed
with
carabines
,
was
*NL*
concealed
in
the
tall
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
assured
and
buttressed
,
the
centre
of
the
Anglo-Dutch
army
was
well
*NL*
posted
.
The
peril
of
this
position
lay
in
the
forest
of
Soignes
,
*NL*
then
adjoining
the
field
of
battle
,
and
intersected
by
the
ponds
of
*NL*
Groenendael
and
Boitsfort
.
An
army
could
not
retreat
thither
without
*NL*
dissolving
;
the
regiments
would
have
broken
up
immediately
there
.
*NL*
The
artillery
would
have
been
lost
among
the
morasses
.
The
retreat
,
*NL*
according
to
many
a
man
versed
in
the
art
,
--
though
it
is
disputed
by
*NL*
others
,
--
would
have
been
a
disorganized
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
centre
,
Wellington
added
one
of
Chasse
's
brigades
taken
from
the
*NL*
right
wing
,
and
one
of
Wincke
's
brigades
taken
from
the
left
wing
,
plus
*NL*
Clinton
's
division
.
To
his
English
,
to
the
regiments
of
Halkett
,
to
*NL*
the
brigades
of
Mitchell
,
to
the
guards
of
Maitland
,
he
gave
as
*NL*
reinforcements
and
aids
,
the
infantry
of
Brunswick
,
Nassau
's
contingent
,
*NL*
Kielmansegg
's
Hanoverians
,
and
Ompteda
's
Germans
.
This
placed
twenty-six
*NL*
battalions
under
his
hand
.
The
right
wing
,
as
Charras
says
,
was
thrown
*NL*
back
on
the
centre
.
An
enormous
battery
was
masked
by
sacks
of
earth
at
*NL*
the
spot
where
there
now
stands
what
is
called
the
``
Museum
of
Waterloo
.
''
*NL*
Besides
this
,
Wellington
had
,
behind
a
rise
in
the
ground
,
Somerset
's
*NL*
Dragoon
Guards
,
fourteen
hundred
horse
strong
.
It
was
the
remaining
half
*NL*
of
the
justly
celebrated
English
cavalry
.
Ponsonby
destroyed
,
Somerset
*NL*
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battery
,
which
,
if
completed
,
would
have
been
almost
a
redoubt
,
was
*NL*
ranged
behind
a
very
low
garden
wall
,
backed
up
with
a
coating
of
bags
*NL*
of
sand
and
a
large
slope
of
earth
.
This
work
was
not
finished
;
there
*NL*
had
been
no
time
to
make
a
palisade
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
,
uneasy
but
impassive
,
was
on
horseback
,
and
there
remained
*NL*
the
whole
day
in
the
same
attitude
,
a
little
in
advance
of
the
old
mill
*NL*
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
which
is
still
in
existence
,
beneath
an
elm
,
which
*NL*
an
Englishman
,
an
enthusiastic
vandal
,
purchased
later
on
for
two
*NL*
hundred
francs
,
cut
down
,
and
carried
off
.
Wellington
was
coldly
heroic
.
*NL*
The
bullets
rained
about
him
.
His
aide-de-camp
,
Gordon
,
fell
at
his
*NL*
side
.
Lord
Hill
,
pointing
to
a
shell
which
had
burst
,
said
to
him
:
``
My
*NL*
lord
,
what
are
your
orders
in
case
you
are
killed
?
''
``
To
do
like
me
,
''
*NL*
replied
Wellington
.
To
Clinton
he
said
laconically
,
``
To
hold
this
spot
*NL*
to
the
last
man
.
''
The
day
was
evidently
turning
out
ill
.
Wellington
*NL*
shouted
to
his
old
companions
of
Talavera
,
of
Vittoria
,
of
Salamanca
:
*NL*
``
Boys
,
can
retreat
be
thought
of
?
Think
of
old
England
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
four
o'clock
,
the
English
line
drew
back
.
Suddenly
nothing
*NL*
was
visible
on
the
crest
of
the
plateau
except
the
artillery
and
the
*NL*
sharpshooters
;
the
rest
had
disappeared
:
the
regiments
,
dislodged
by
*NL*
the
shells
and
the
French
bullets
,
retreated
into
the
bottom
,
now
*NL*
intersected
by
the
back
road
of
the
farm
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
;
a
*NL*
retrograde
movement
took
place
,
the
English
front
hid
itself
,
Wellington
*NL*
drew
back
.
``
The
beginning
of
retreat
!
''
cried
Napoleon
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
NAPOLEON
IN
A
GOOD
HUMOR
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
,
though
ill
and
discommoded
on
horseback
by
a
local
trouble
,
*NL*
had
never
been
in
a
better
humor
than
on
that
day
.
His
impenetrability
*NL*
had
been
smiling
ever
since
the
morning
.
On
the
18th
of
June
,
that
*NL*
profound
soul
masked
by
marble
beamed
blindly
.
The
man
who
had
been
*NL*
gloomy
at
Austerlitz
was
gay
at
Waterloo
.
The
greatest
favorites
of
*NL*
destiny
make
mistakes
.
Our
joys
are
composed
of
shadow
.
The
supreme
*NL*
smile
is
God
's
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ridet
Caesar
,
Pompeius
flebit
,
said
the
legionaries
of
the
Fulminatrix
*NL*
Legion
.
Pompey
was
not
destined
to
weep
on
that
occasion
,
but
it
is
*NL*
certain
that
Caesar
laughed
.
While
exploring
on
horseback
at
one
o'clock
*NL*
on
the
preceding
night
,
in
storm
and
rain
,
in
company
with
Bertrand
,
the
*NL*
communes
in
the
neighborhood
of
Rossomme
,
satisfied
at
the
sight
of
the
*NL*
long
line
of
the
English
camp-fires
illuminating
the
whole
horizon
from
*NL*
Frischemont
to
Braine-l'Alleud
,
it
had
seemed
to
him
that
fate
,
to
*NL*
whom
he
had
assigned
a
day
on
the
field
of
Waterloo
,
was
exact
to
*NL*
the
appointment
;
he
stopped
his
horse
,
and
remained
for
some
time
*NL*
motionless
,
gazing
at
the
lightning
and
listening
to
the
thunder
;
*NL*
and
this
fatalist
was
heard
to
cast
into
the
darkness
this
mysterious
*NL*
saying
,
``
We
are
in
accord
.
''
Napoleon
was
mistaken
.
They
were
no
longer
*NL*
in
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
not
a
moment
for
sleep
;
every
instant
of
that
night
was
marked
*NL*
by
a
joy
for
him
.
He
traversed
the
line
of
the
principal
outposts
,
*NL*
halting
here
and
there
to
talk
to
the
sentinels
.
At
half-past
two
,
near
*NL*
the
wood
of
Hougomont
,
he
heard
the
tread
of
a
column
on
the
march
;
he
*NL*
thought
at
the
moment
that
it
was
a
retreat
on
the
part
of
Wellington
.
*NL*
He
said
:
``
It
is
the
rear-guard
of
the
English
getting
under
way
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
decamping
.
I
will
take
prisoners
the
six
thousand
English
who
*NL*
have
just
arrived
at
Ostend
.
''
He
conversed
expansively
;
he
regained
the
*NL*
animation
which
he
had
shown
at
his
landing
on
the
first
of
March
,
when
*NL*
he
pointed
out
to
the
Grand-Marshal
the
enthusiastic
peasant
of
the
Gulf
*NL*
Juan
,
and
cried
,
``
Well
,
Bertrand
,
here
is
a
reinforcement
already
!
''
On
*NL*
the
night
of
the
17th
to
the
18th
of
June
he
rallied
Wellington
.
``
That
*NL*
little
Englishman
needs
a
lesson
,
''
said
Napoleon
.
The
rain
redoubled
in
*NL*
violence
;
the
thunder
rolled
while
the
Emperor
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
he
lost
one
illusion
;
*NL*
officers
who
had
been
despatched
to
reconnoitre
announced
to
him
that
*NL*
the
enemy
was
not
making
any
movement
.
Nothing
was
stirring
;
not
a
*NL*
bivouac-fire
had
been
extinguished
;
the
English
army
was
asleep
.
The
*NL*
silence
on
earth
was
profound
;
the
only
noise
was
in
the
heavens
.
*NL*
At
four
o'clock
,
a
peasant
was
brought
in
to
him
by
the
scouts
;
this
*NL*
peasant
had
served
as
guide
to
a
brigade
of
English
cavalry
,
probably
*NL*
Vivian
's
brigade
,
which
was
on
its
way
to
take
up
a
position
in
the
*NL*
village
of
Ohain
,
at
the
extreme
left
.
At
five
o'clock
,
two
Belgian
*NL*
deserters
reported
to
him
that
they
had
just
quitted
their
regiment
,
*NL*
and
that
the
English
army
was
ready
for
battle
.
``
So
much
the
better
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Napoleon
.
``
I
prefer
to
overthrow
them
rather
than
to
drive
*NL*
them
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
he
dismounted
in
the
mud
on
the
slope
which
forms
an
*NL*
angle
with
the
Plancenoit
road
,
had
a
kitchen
table
and
a
peasant
's
*NL*
chair
brought
to
him
from
the
farm
of
Rossomme
,
seated
himself
,
with
a
*NL*
truss
of
straw
for
a
carpet
,
and
spread
out
on
the
table
the
chart
*NL*
of
the
battle-field
,
saying
to
Soult
as
he
did
so
,
``
A
pretty
*NL*
checker-board
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
consequence
of
the
rains
during
the
night
,
the
transports
of
*NL*
provisions
,
embedded
in
the
soft
roads
,
had
not
been
able
to
arrive
by
*NL*
morning
;
the
soldiers
had
had
no
sleep
;
they
were
wet
and
fasting
.
This
*NL*
did
not
prevent
Napoleon
from
exclaiming
cheerfully
to
Ney
,
``
We
have
*NL*
ninety
chances
out
of
a
hundred
.
''
At
eight
o'clock
the
Emperor
's
*NL*
breakfast
was
brought
to
him
.
He
invited
many
generals
to
it
.
During
*NL*
breakfast
,
it
was
said
that
Wellington
had
been
to
a
ball
two
nights
*NL*
before
,
in
Brussels
,
at
the
Duchess
of
Richmond
's
;
and
Soult
,
a
rough
*NL*
man
of
war
,
with
a
face
of
an
archbishop
,
said
,
``
The
ball
takes
place
*NL*
to-day
.
''
The
Emperor
jested
with
Ney
,
who
said
,
``
Wellington
will
not
be
*NL*
so
simple
as
to
wait
for
Your
Majesty
.
''
That
was
his
way
,
however
.
``
He
*NL*
was
fond
of
jesting
,
''
says
Fleury
de
Chaboulon
.
``
A
merry
humor
was
*NL*
at
the
foundation
of
his
character
,
''
says
Gourgaud
.
``
He
abounded
in
*NL*
pleasantries
,
which
were
more
peculiar
than
witty
,
''
says
Benjamin
*NL*
Constant
.
These
gayeties
of
a
giant
are
worthy
of
insistence
.
It
was
*NL*
he
who
called
his
grenadiers
``
his
grumblers
''
;
he
pinched
their
ears
;
he
*NL*
pulled
their
mustaches
.
``
The
Emperor
did
nothing
but
play
pranks
on
us
,
''
*NL*
is
the
remark
of
one
of
them
.
During
the
mysterious
trip
from
the
island
*NL*
of
Elba
to
France
,
on
the
27th
of
February
,
on
the
open
sea
,
the
French
*NL*
brig
of
war
,
Le
Zephyr
,
having
encountered
the
brig
L'Inconstant
,
on
*NL*
which
Napoleon
was
concealed
,
and
having
asked
the
news
of
Napoleon
*NL*
from
L'Inconstant
,
the
Emperor
,
who
still
wore
in
his
hat
the
white
and
*NL*
amaranthine
cockade
sown
with
bees
,
which
he
had
adopted
at
the
isle
of
*NL*
Elba
,
laughingly
seized
the
speaking-trumpet
,
and
answered
for
himself
,
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
is
well
.
''
A
man
who
laughs
like
that
is
on
familiar
terms
*NL*
with
events
.
Napoleon
indulged
in
many
fits
of
this
laughter
during
the
*NL*
breakfast
at
Waterloo
.
After
breakfast
he
meditated
for
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
;
then
two
generals
seated
themselves
on
the
truss
of
straw
,
pen
in
*NL*
hand
and
their
paper
on
their
knees
,
and
the
Emperor
dictated
to
them
*NL*
the
order
of
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nine
o'clock
,
at
the
instant
when
the
French
army
,
ranged
in
echelons
*NL*
and
set
in
motion
in
five
columns
,
had
deployed
--
the
divisions
in
two
*NL*
lines
,
the
artillery
between
the
brigades
,
the
music
at
their
head
;
as
*NL*
they
beat
the
march
,
with
rolls
on
the
drums
and
the
blasts
of
trumpets
,
*NL*
mighty
,
vast
,
joyous
,
a
sea
of
casques
,
of
sabres
,
and
of
bayonets
on
*NL*
the
horizon
,
the
Emperor
was
touched
,
and
twice
exclaimed
,
``
Magnificent
!
*NL*
Magnificent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
nine
o'clock
and
half-past
ten
the
whole
army
,
incredible
as
it
*NL*
may
appear
,
had
taken
up
its
position
and
ranged
itself
in
six
lines
,
*NL*
forming
,
to
repeat
the
Emperor
's
expression
,
``
the
figure
of
six
V
's
.
''
*NL*
A
few
moments
after
the
formation
of
the
battle-array
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
that
profound
silence
,
like
that
which
heralds
the
beginning
of
a
storm
,
*NL*
which
precedes
engagements
,
the
Emperor
tapped
Haxo
on
the
shoulder
,
as
*NL*
he
beheld
the
three
batteries
of
twelve-pounders
,
detached
by
his
orders
*NL*
from
the
corps
of
Erlon
,
Reille
,
and
Lobau
,
and
destined
to
begin
the
*NL*
action
by
taking
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
which
was
situated
at
the
intersection
*NL*
of
the
Nivelles
and
the
Genappe
roads
,
and
said
to
him
,
``
There
are
four
*NL*
and
twenty
handsome
maids
,
General
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sure
of
the
issue
,
he
encouraged
with
a
smile
,
as
they
passed
before
*NL*
him
,
the
company
of
sappers
of
the
first
corps
,
which
he
had
appointed
*NL*
to
barricade
Mont-Saint-Jean
as
soon
as
the
village
should
be
carried
.
*NL*
All
this
serenity
had
been
traversed
by
but
a
single
word
of
haughty
*NL*
pity
;
perceiving
on
his
left
,
at
a
spot
where
there
now
stands
a
large
*NL*
tomb
,
those
admirable
Scotch
Grays
,
with
their
superb
horses
,
massing
*NL*
themselves
,
he
said
,
``
It
is
a
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
mounted
his
horse
,
advanced
beyond
Rossomme
,
and
selected
for
*NL*
his
post
of
observation
a
contracted
elevation
of
turf
to
the
right
of
*NL*
the
road
from
Genappe
to
Brussels
,
which
was
his
second
station
during
*NL*
the
battle
.
The
third
station
,
the
one
adopted
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
between
La
Belle-Alliance
and
La
Haie-Sainte
,
is
formidable
;
*NL*
it
is
a
rather
elevated
knoll
,
which
still
exists
,
and
behind
which
the
*NL*
guard
was
massed
on
a
slope
of
the
plain
.
Around
this
knoll
the
balls
*NL*
rebounded
from
the
pavements
of
the
road
,
up
to
Napoleon
himself
.
As
at
*NL*
Brienne
,
he
had
over
his
head
the
shriek
of
the
bullets
and
of
the
*NL*
heavy
artillery
.
Mouldy
cannon-balls
,
old
sword-blades
,
and
shapeless
*NL*
projectiles
,
eaten
up
with
rust
,
were
picked
up
at
the
spot
where
his
*NL*
horse
'
feet
stood
.
Scabra
rubigine
.
A
few
years
ago
,
a
shell
of
sixty
*NL*
pounds
,
still
charged
,
and
with
its
fuse
broken
off
level
with
the
bomb
,
*NL*
was
unearthed
.
It
was
at
this
last
post
that
the
Emperor
said
to
his
*NL*
guide
,
Lacoste
,
a
hostile
and
terrified
peasant
,
who
was
attached
to
the
*NL*
saddle
of
a
hussar
,
and
who
turned
round
at
every
discharge
of
canister
*NL*
and
tried
to
hide
behind
Napoleon
:
``
Fool
,
it
is
shameful
!
You
'll
get
*NL*
yourself
killed
with
a
ball
in
the
back
.
''
He
who
writes
these
lines
has
*NL*
himself
found
,
in
the
friable
soil
of
this
knoll
,
on
turning
over
*NL*
the
sand
,
the
remains
of
the
neck
of
a
bomb
,
disintegrated
,
by
the
*NL*
oxidization
of
six
and
forty
years
,
and
old
fragments
of
iron
which
*NL*
parted
like
elder-twigs
between
the
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
is
aware
that
the
variously
inclined
undulations
of
the
*NL*
plains
,
where
the
engagement
between
Napoleon
and
Wellington
took
place
,
*NL*
are
no
longer
what
they
were
on
June
18
,
1815
.
By
taking
from
this
*NL*
mournful
field
the
wherewithal
to
make
a
monument
to
it
,
its
real
relief
*NL*
has
been
taken
away
,
and
history
,
disconcerted
,
no
longer
finds
her
*NL*
bearings
there
.
It
has
been
disfigured
for
the
sake
of
glorifying
*NL*
it
.
Wellington
,
when
he
beheld
Waterloo
once
more
,
two
years
later
,
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
They
have
altered
my
field
of
battle
!
''
Where
the
great
*NL*
pyramid
of
earth
,
surmounted
by
the
lion
,
rises
to-day
,
there
was
a
*NL*
hillock
which
descended
in
an
easy
slope
towards
the
Nivelles
road
,
but
*NL*
which
was
almost
an
escarpment
on
the
side
of
the
highway
to
Genappe
.
*NL*
The
elevation
of
this
escarpment
can
still
be
measured
by
the
height
of
*NL*
the
two
knolls
of
the
two
great
sepulchres
which
enclose
the
road
from
*NL*
Genappe
to
Brussels
:
one
,
the
English
tomb
,
is
on
the
left
;
the
other
,
*NL*
the
German
tomb
,
is
on
the
right
.
There
is
no
French
tomb
.
The
whole
*NL*
of
that
plain
is
a
sepulchre
for
France
.
Thanks
to
the
thousands
upon
*NL*
thousands
of
cartloads
of
earth
employed
in
the
hillock
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
feet
in
height
and
half
a
mile
in
circumference
,
the
plateau
*NL*
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
is
now
accessible
by
an
easy
slope
.
On
the
day
of
*NL*
battle
,
particularly
on
the
side
of
La
Haie-Sainte
,
it
was
abrupt
and
*NL*
difficult
of
approach
.
The
slope
there
is
so
steep
that
the
English
*NL*
cannon
could
not
see
the
farm
,
situated
in
the
bottom
of
the
valley
,
*NL*
which
was
the
centre
of
the
combat
.
On
the
18th
of
June
,
1815
,
the
rains
*NL*
had
still
farther
increased
this
acclivity
,
the
mud
complicated
the
*NL*
problem
of
the
ascent
,
and
the
men
not
only
slipped
back
,
but
stuck
fast
*NL*
in
the
mire
.
Along
the
crest
of
the
plateau
ran
a
sort
of
trench
whose
*NL*
presence
it
was
impossible
for
the
distant
observer
to
divine
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
this
trench
?
Let
us
explain
.
Braine-l'Alleud
is
a
Belgian
*NL*
village
;
Ohain
is
another
.
These
villages
,
both
of
them
concealed
in
*NL*
curves
of
the
landscape
,
are
connected
by
a
road
about
a
league
and
a
*NL*
half
in
length
,
which
traverses
the
plain
along
its
undulating
level
,
*NL*
and
often
enters
and
buries
itself
in
the
hills
like
a
furrow
,
which
*NL*
makes
a
ravine
of
this
road
in
some
places
.
In
1815
,
as
at
the
present
*NL*
day
,
this
road
cut
the
crest
of
the
plateau
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
between
*NL*
the
two
highways
from
Genappe
and
Nivelles
;
only
,
it
is
now
on
a
level
*NL*
with
the
plain
;
it
was
then
a
hollow
way
.
Its
two
slopes
have
been
*NL*
appropriated
for
the
monumental
hillock
.
This
road
was
,
and
still
is
,
*NL*
a
trench
throughout
the
greater
portion
of
its
course
;
a
hollow
trench
,
*NL*
sometimes
a
dozen
feet
in
depth
,
and
whose
banks
,
being
too
steep
,
*NL*
crumbled
away
here
and
there
,
particularly
in
winter
,
under
driving
*NL*
rains
.
Accidents
happened
here
.
The
road
was
so
narrow
at
the
*NL*
Braine-l'Alleud
entrance
that
a
passer-by
was
crushed
by
a
cart
,
as
is
*NL*
proved
by
a
stone
cross
which
stands
near
the
cemetery
,
and
which
gives
*NL*
the
name
of
the
dead
,
Monsieur
Bernard
Debrye
,
Merchant
of
Brussels
,
*NL*
and
the
date
of
the
accident
,
February
,
1637
.

It
was
so
deep
on
*NL*
the
table-land
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
that
a
peasant
,
Mathieu
Nicaise
,
*NL*
was
crushed
there
,
in
1783
,
by
a
slide
from
the
slope
,
as
is
stated
on
*NL*
another
stone
cross
,
the
top
of
which
has
disappeared
in
the
process
of
*NL*
clearing
the
ground
,

whose
overturned
pedestal
is
still
visible
on

the
grassy
slope
to

the
farm
of
Mont-Saint-Jean

*NL*
On
the
day
of
battle
,
this
hollow
road
whose
existence
was
in
no
way
*NL*
indicated
,
bordering
the
crest
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
a
trench
at
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
escarpment
,
a
rut
concealed
in
the
soil

was
invisible
;
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
terrible

CHAPTER

--
THE
EMPEROR
PUTS
A
QUESTION
TO
THE
GUIDE
LACOSTE
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
on
the
morning
of
Waterloo
,
Napoleon
was
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
right
;
the
plan
of
battle
conceived
by
him
was
,
as
we
have
seen
,
*NL*
really
admirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
battle
once
begun
,
its
very
various
changes
,
--
the
resistance
of
*NL*
Hougomont
;
the
tenacity
of
La
Haie-Sainte
;
the
killing
of
Bauduin
;
the
*NL*
disabling
of
Foy
;
the
unexpected
wall
against
which
Soye
's
brigade
was
*NL*
shattered
;
Guilleminot
's
fatal
heedlessness
when
he
had
neither
petard
*NL*
nor
powder
sacks
;
the
miring
of
the
batteries
;
the
fifteen
unescorted
*NL*
pieces
overwhelmed
in
a
hollow
way
by
Uxbridge
;
the
small
effect
of
the
*NL*
bombs
falling
in
the
English
lines
,
and
there
embedding
themselves
in
*NL*
the
rain-soaked
soil
,
and
only
succeeding
in
producing
volcanoes
of
mud
,
*NL*
so
that
the
canister
was
turned
into
a
splash
;
the
uselessness
of
Pire
's
*NL*
demonstration
on
Braine-l'Alleud
;
all
that
cavalry
,
fifteen
squadrons
,
*NL*
almost
exterminated
;
the
right
wing
of
the
English
badly
alarmed
,
the
*NL*
left
wing
badly
cut
into
;
Ney
's
strange
mistake
in
massing
,
instead
of
*NL*
echelonning
the
four
divisions
of
the
first
corps
;
men
delivered
over
to
*NL*
grape-shot
,
arranged
in
ranks
twenty-seven
deep
and
with
a
frontage
*NL*
of
two
hundred
;
the
frightful
holes
made
in
these
masses
by
the
*NL*
cannon-balls
;
attacking
columns
disorganized
;
the
side-battery
suddenly
*NL*
unmasked
on
their
flank
;
Bourgeois
,
Donzelot
,
and
Durutte
compromised
;
*NL*
Quiot
repulsed
;
Lieutenant
Vieux
,
that
Hercules
graduated
at
the
*NL*
Polytechnic
School
,
wounded
at
the
moment
when
he
was
beating
in
with
an
*NL*
axe
the
door
of
La
Haie-Sainte
under
the
downright
fire
of
the
English
*NL*
barricade
which
barred
the
angle
of
the
road
from
Genappe
to
Brussels
;
*NL*
Marcognet
's
division
caught
between
the
infantry
and
the
cavalry
,
shot
*NL*
down
at
the
very
muzzle
of
the
guns
amid
the
grain
by
Best
and
Pack
,
put
*NL*
to
the
sword
by
Ponsonby
;
his
battery
of
seven
pieces
spiked
;
the
Prince
*NL*
of
Saxe-Weimar
holding
and
guarding
,
in
spite
of
the
Comte
d'Erlon
,
both
*NL*
Frischemont
and
Smohain
;
the
flag
of
the
105th
taken
,
the
flag
of
the
*NL*
45th
captured
;
that
black
Prussian
hussar
stopped
by
runners
of
the
*NL*
flying
column
of
three
hundred
light
cavalry
on
the
scout
between
Wavre
*NL*
and
Plancenoit
;
the
alarming
things
that
had
been
said
by
prisoners
;
*NL*
Grouchy
's
delay
;
fifteen
hundred
men
killed
in
the
orchard
of
Hougomont
*NL*
in
less
than
an
hour
;
eighteen
hundred
men
overthrown
in
a
still
shorter
*NL*
time
about
La
Haie-Sainte
,
--
all
these
stormy
incidents
passing
like
the
*NL*
clouds
of
battle
before
Napoleon
,
had
hardly
troubled
his
gaze
and
*NL*
had
not
overshadowed
that
face
of
imperial
certainty
.
Napoleon
was
*NL*
accustomed
to
gaze
steadily
at
war
;
he
never
added
up
the
heart-rending
*NL*
details
,
cipher
by
cipher
;
ciphers
mattered
little
to
him
,
provided
that
*NL*
they
furnished
the
total
,
victory
;
he
was
not
alarmed
if
the
beginnings
*NL*
did
go
astray
,
since
he
thought
himself
the
master
and
the
possessor
*NL*
at
the
end
;
he
knew
how
to
wait
,
supposing
himself
to
be
out
of
the
*NL*
question
,
and
he
treated
destiny
as
his
equal
:
he
seemed
to
say
to
fate
,
*NL*
Thou
wilt
not
dare
.
*NL*
*NL*
Composed
half
of
light
and
half
of
shadow
,
Napoleon
thought
himself
*NL*
protected
in
good
and
tolerated
in
evil
.
He
had
,
or
thought
that
he
had
,
*NL*
a
connivance
,
one
might
almost
say
a
complicity
,
of
events
in
his
favor
,
*NL*
which
was
equivalent
to
the
invulnerability
of
antiquity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
when
one
has
Beresina
,
Leipzig
,
and
Fontainebleau
behind
*NL*
one
,
it
seems
as
though
one
might
distrust
Waterloo
.
A
mysterious
frown
*NL*
becomes
perceptible
in
the
depths
of
the
heavens
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Wellington
retreated
,
Napoleon
shuddered
.
He
suddenly
*NL*
beheld
the
table-land
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
cleared
,
and
the
van
of
the
*NL*
English
army
disappear
.
It
was
rallying
,
but
hiding
itself
.
The
Emperor
*NL*
half
rose
in
his
stirrups
.
The
lightning
of
victory
flashed
from
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
,
driven
into
a
corner
at
the
forest
of
Soignes
and
*NL*
destroyed
--
that
was
the
definitive
conquest
of
England
by
France
;
it
was
*NL*
Crecy
,
Poitiers
,
Malplaquet
,
and
Ramillies
avenged
.
The
man
of
Marengo
*NL*
was
wiping
out
Agincourt
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
Emperor
,
meditating
on
this
terrible
turn
of
fortune
,
swept
his
*NL*
glass
for
the
last
time
over
all
the
points
of
the
field
of
battle
.
His
*NL*
guard
,
standing
behind
him
with
grounded
arms
,
watched
him
from
below
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
religion
.
He
pondered
;
he
examined
the
slopes
,
noted
the
*NL*
declivities
,
scrutinized
the
clumps
of
trees
,
the
square
of
rye
,
the
*NL*
path
;
he
seemed
to
be
counting
each
bush
.
He
gazed
with
some
intentness
*NL*
at
the
English
barricades
of
the
two
highways
,
--
two
large
abatis
of
*NL*
trees
,
that
on
the
road
to
Genappe
above
La
Haie-Sainte
,
armed
with
two
*NL*
cannon
,
the
only
ones
out
of
all
the
English
artillery
which
commanded
*NL*
the
extremity
of
the
field
of
battle
,
and
that
on
the
road
to
Nivelles
*NL*
where
gleamed
the
Dutch
bayonets
of
Chasse
's
brigade
.
Near
this
*NL*
barricade
he
observed
the
old
chapel
of
Saint
Nicholas
,
painted
white
,
*NL*
which
stands
at
the
angle
of
the
cross-road
near
Braine-l'Alleud
;
he
*NL*
bent
down
and
spoke
in
a
low
voice
to
the
guide
Lacoste
.
The
guide
made
*NL*
a
negative
sign
with
his
head
,
which
was
probably
perfidious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
straightened
himself
up
and
fell
to
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
had
drawn
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
remained
to
do
was
to
complete
this
retreat
by
crushing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
turning
round
abruptly
,
despatched
an
express
at
full
speed
to
*NL*
Paris
to
announce
that
the
battle
was
won
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
was
one
of
those
geniuses
from
whom
thunder
darts
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
found
his
clap
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
orders
to
Milhaud
's
cuirassiers
to
carry
the
table-land
of
*NL*
Mont-Saint-Jean
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
THE
UNEXPECTED
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
thousand
five
hundred
of
them
.
They
formed
a
front
a
*NL*
quarter
of
a
league
in
extent
.
They
were
giant
men
,
on
colossal
horses
.
*NL*
There
were
six
and
twenty
squadrons
of
them
;
and
they
had
behind
them
to
*NL*
support
them
Lefebvre-Desnouettes
's
division
,
--
the
one
hundred
and
six
*NL*
picked
gendarmes
,
the
light
cavalry
of
the
Guard
,
eleven
hundred
and
*NL*
ninety-seven
men
,
and
the
lancers
of
the
guard
of
eight
hundred
and
*NL*
eighty
lances
.
They
wore
casques
without
horse-tails
,
and
cuirasses
*NL*
of
beaten
iron
,
with
horse-pistols
in
their
holsters
,
and
long
*NL*
sabre-swords
.
That
morning
the
whole
army
had
admired
them
,
when
,
at
*NL*
nine
o'clock
,
with
braying
of
trumpets
and
all
the
music
playing
``
Let
us
*NL*
watch
o'er
the
Safety
of
the
Empire
,
''
they
had
come
in
a
solid
column
,
*NL*
with
one
of
their
batteries
on
their
flank
,
another
in
their
centre
,
and
*NL*
deployed
in
two
ranks
between
the
roads
to
Genappe
and
Frischemont
,
*NL*
and
taken
up
their
position
for
battle
in
that
powerful
second
line
,
*NL*
so
cleverly
arranged
by
Napoleon
,
which
,
having
on
its
extreme
left
*NL*
Kellermann
's
cuirassiers
and
on
its
extreme
right
Milhaud
's
cuirassiers
,
*NL*
had
,
so
to
speak
,
two
wings
of
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aide-de-camp
Bernard
carried
them
the
Emperor
's
orders
.
Ney
drew
his
*NL*
sword
and
placed
himself
at
their
head
.
The
enormous
squadrons
were
set
*NL*
in
motion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
formidable
spectacle
was
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
their
cavalry
,
with
upraised
swords
,
standards
and
trumpets
flung
to
*NL*
the
breeze
,
formed
in
columns
by
divisions
,
descended
,
by
a
simultaneous
*NL*
movement
and
like
one
man
,
with
the
precision
of
a
brazen
battering-ram
*NL*
which
is
effecting
a
breach
,
the
hill
of
La
Belle
Alliance
,
plunged
into
*NL*
the
terrible
depths
in
which
so
many
men
had
already
fallen
,
disappeared
*NL*
there
in
the
smoke
,
then
emerging
from
that
shadow
,
reappeared
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
valley
,
still
compact
and
in
close
ranks
,
mounting
at
*NL*
a
full
trot
,
through
a
storm
of
grape-shot
which
burst
upon
them
,
*NL*
the
terrible
muddy
slope
of
the
table-land
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
.
They
*NL*
ascended
,
grave
,
threatening
,
imperturbable
;
in
the
intervals
between
*NL*
the
musketry
and
the
artillery
,
their
colossal
trampling
was
audible
.
*NL*
Being
two
divisions
,
there
were
two
columns
of
them
;
Wathier
's
division
*NL*
held
the
right
,
Delort
's
division
was
on
the
left
.
It
seemed
as
though
*NL*
two
immense
adders
of
steel
were
to
be
seen
crawling
towards
the
crest
*NL*
of
the
table-land
.
It
traversed
the
battle
like
a
prodigy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
like
it
had
been
seen
since
the
taking
of
the
great
redoubt
of
*NL*
the
Muskowa
by
the
heavy
cavalry
;
Murat
was
lacking
here
,
but
Ney
was
*NL*
again
present
.
It
seemed
as
though
that
mass
had
become
a
monster
and
*NL*
had
but
one
soul
.
Each
column
undulated
and
swelled
like
the
ring
of
a
*NL*
polyp
.
They
could
be
seen
through
a
vast
cloud
of
smoke
which
was
rent
*NL*
here
and
there
.
A
confusion
of
helmets
,
of
cries
,
of
sabres
,
a
stormy
*NL*
heaving
of
the
cruppers
of
horses
amid
the
cannons
and
the
flourish
of
*NL*
trumpets
,
a
terrible
and
disciplined
tumult
;
over
all
,
the
cuirasses
*NL*
like
the
scales
on
the
hydra
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
narrations
seemed
to
belong
to
another
age
.
Something
parallel
to
*NL*
this
vision
appeared
,
no
doubt
,
in
the
ancient
Orphic
epics
,
which
told
*NL*
of
the
centaurs
,
the
old
hippanthropes
,
those
Titans
with
human
*NL*
heads
and
equestrian
chests
who
scaled
Olympus
at
a
gallop
,
horrible
,
*NL*
invulnerable
,
sublime
--
gods
and
beasts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Odd
numerical
coincidence
,
--
twenty-six
battalions
rode
to
meet
*NL*
twenty-six
battalions
.
Behind
the
crest
of
the
plateau
,
in
the
shadow
of
*NL*
the
masked
battery
,
the
English
infantry
,
formed
into
thirteen
squares
,
*NL*
two
battalions
to
the
square
,
in
two
lines
,
with
seven
in
the
first
*NL*
line
,
six
in
the
second
,
the
stocks
of
their
guns
to
their
shoulders
,
*NL*
taking
aim
at
that
which
was
on
the
point
of
appearing
,
waited
,
calm
,
*NL*
mute
,
motionless
.
They
did
not
see
the
cuirassiers
,
and
the
cuirassiers
*NL*
did
not
see
them
.
They
listened
to
the
rise
of
this
flood
of
men
.
They
*NL*
heard
the
swelling
noise
of
three
thousand
horse
,
the
alternate
and
*NL*
symmetrical
tramp
of
their
hoofs
at
full
trot
,
the
jingling
of
the
*NL*
cuirasses
,
the
clang
of
the
sabres
and
a
sort
of
grand
and
savage
*NL*
breathing
.
There
ensued
a
most
terrible
silence
;
then
,
all
at
once
,
*NL*
a
long
file
of
uplifted
arms
,
brandishing
sabres
,
appeared
above
the
*NL*
crest
,
and
casques
,
trumpets
,
and
standards
,
and
three
thousand
heads
*NL*
with
gray
mustaches
,
shouting
,
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
All
this
cavalry
*NL*
debouched
on
the
plateau
,
and
it
was
like
the
appearance
of
an
*NL*
earthquake
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
a
tragic
incident
;
on
the
English
left
,
on
our
right
,
the
*NL*
head
of
the
column
of
cuirassiers
reared
up
with
a
frightful
clamor
.
On
*NL*
arriving
at
the
culminating
point
of
the
crest
,
ungovernable
,
utterly
*NL*
given
over
to
fury
and
their
course
of
extermination
of
the
squares
and
*NL*
cannon
,
the
cuirassiers
had
just
caught
sight
of
a
trench
,
--
a
trench
*NL*
between
them
and
the
English
.
It
was
the
hollow
road
of
Ohain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
terrible
moment
.
The
ravine
was
there
,
unexpected
,
yawning
,
*NL*
directly
under
the
horses
'
feet
,
two
fathoms
deep
between
its
double
*NL*
slopes
;
the
second
file
pushed
the
first
into
it
,
and
the
third
pushed
*NL*
on
the
second
;
the
horses
reared
and
fell
backward
,
landed
on
their
*NL*
haunches
,
slid
down
,
all
four
feet
in
the
air
,
crushing
and
overwhelming
*NL*
the
riders
;
and
there
being
no
means
of
retreat
,
--
the
whole
column
being
*NL*
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
projectile
,
--
the
force
which
had
been
*NL*
acquired
to
crush
the
English
crushed
the
French
;
the
inexorable
ravine
*NL*
could
only
yield
when
filled
;
horses
and
riders
rolled
there
pell-mell
,
*NL*
grinding
each
other
,
forming
but
one
mass
of
flesh
in
this
gulf
:
when
*NL*
this
trench
was
full
of
living
men
,
the
rest
marched
over
them
and
*NL*
passed
on
.
Almost
a
third
of
Dubois
's
brigade
fell
into
that
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
began
the
loss
of
the
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
local
tradition
,
which
evidently
exaggerates
matters
,
says
that
two
*NL*
thousand
horses
and
fifteen
hundred
men
were
buried
in
the
hollow
road
*NL*
of
Ohain
.
This
figure
probably
comprises
all
the
other
corpses
which
*NL*
were
flung
into
this
ravine
the
day
after
the
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
note
in
passing
that
it
was
Dubois
's
sorely
tried
brigade
which
,
*NL*
an
hour
previously
,
making
a
charge
to
one
side
,
had
captured
the
flag
*NL*
of
the
Lunenburg
battalion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
,
before
giving
the
order
for
this
charge
of
Milhaud
's
*NL*
cuirassiers
,
had
scrutinized
the
ground
,
but
had
not
been
able
to
see
*NL*
that
hollow
road
,
which
did
not
even
form
a
wrinkle
on
the
surface
of
*NL*
the
plateau
.
Warned
,
nevertheless
,
and
put
on
the
alert
by
the
little
*NL*
white
chapel
which
marks
its
angle
of
junction
with
the
Nivelles
*NL*
highway
,
he
had
probably
put
a
question
as
to
the
possibility
of
an
*NL*
obstacle
,
to
the
guide
Lacoste
.
The
guide
had
answered
No
.
We
might
*NL*
almost
affirm
that
Napoleon
's
catastrophe
originated
in
that
sign
of
a
*NL*
peasant
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
fatalities
were
destined
to
arise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
possible
that
Napoleon
should
have
won
that
battle
?
We
answer
No
.
*NL*
Why
?
Because
of
Wellington
?
Because
of
Blucher
?
No
.
Because
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bonaparte
victor
at
Waterloo
;
that
does
not
come
within
the
law
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
.
Another
series
of
facts
was
in
preparation
,
in
which
*NL*
there
was
no
longer
any
room
for
Napoleon
.
The
ill
will
of
events
had
*NL*
declared
itself
long
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
time
that
this
vast
man
should
fall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
excessive
weight
of
this
man
in
human
destiny
disturbed
the
balance
.
*NL*
This
individual
alone
counted
for
more
than
a
universal
group
.
These
*NL*
plethoras
of
all
human
vitality
concentrated
in
a
single
head
;
the
world
*NL*
mounting
to
the
brain
of
one
man
,
--
this
would
be
mortal
to
civilization
*NL*
were
it
to
last
.
The
moment
had
arrived
for
the
incorruptible
and
*NL*
supreme
equity
to
alter
its
plan
.
Probably
the
principles
and
the
*NL*
elements
,
on
which
the
regular
gravitations
of
the
moral
,
as
of
the
*NL*
material
,
world
depend
,
had
complained
.
Smoking
blood
,
over-filled
*NL*
cemeteries
,
mothers
in
tears
,
--
these
are
formidable
pleaders
.
When
*NL*
the
earth
is
suffering
from
too
heavy
a
burden
,
there
are
mysterious
*NL*
groanings
of
the
shades
,
to
which
the
abyss
lends
an
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Napoleon
had
been
denounced
in
the
infinite
and
his
fall
had
been
*NL*
decided
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
embarrassed
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waterloo
is
not
a
battle
;
it
is
a
change
of
front
on
the
part
of
the
*NL*
Universe
.

CHAPTER
X
--
THE
PLATEAU
OF
MONT-SAINT-JEAN
*NL*
*NL*
The
battery
was
unmasked
at
the
same
moment
with
the
ravine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sixty
cannons
and
the
thirteen
squares
darted
lightning
point-blank
on
*NL*
the
cuirassiers
.
The
intrepid
General
Delort
made
the
military
salute
to
*NL*
the
English
battery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
the
flying
artillery
of
the
English
had
re-entered
the
*NL*
squares
at
a
gallop
.
The
cuirassiers
had
not
had
even
the
time
for
a
*NL*
halt
.
The
disaster
of
the
hollow
road
had
decimated
,
but
not
discouraged
*NL*
them
.
They
belonged
to
that
class
of
men
who
,
when
diminished
in
number
,
*NL*
increase
in
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wathier
's
column
alone
had
suffered
in
the
disaster
;
Delort
's
column
,
*NL*
which
Ney
had
deflected
to
the
left
,
as
though
he
had
a
presentiment
of
*NL*
an
ambush
,
had
arrived
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cuirassiers
hurled
themselves
on
the
English
squares
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
full
speed
,
with
bridles
loose
,
swords
in
their
teeth
pistols
in
*NL*
fist
,
--
such
was
the
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
moments
in
battles
in
which
the
soul
hardens
the
man
until
*NL*
the
soldier
is
changed
into
a
statue
,
and
when
all
this
flesh
turns
into
*NL*
granite
.
The
English
battalions
,
desperately
assaulted
,
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
it
was
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
faces
of
the
English
squares
were
attacked
at
once
.
A
frenzied
*NL*
whirl
enveloped
them
.
That
cold
infantry
remained
impassive
.
The
first
*NL*
rank
knelt
and
received
the
cuirassiers
on
their
bayonets
,
the
second
*NL*
ranks
shot
them
down
;
behind
the
second
rank
the
cannoneers
charged
*NL*
their
guns
,
the
front
of
the
square
parted
,
permitted
the
passage
of
*NL*
an
eruption
of
grape-shot
,
and
closed
again
.
The
cuirassiers
replied
*NL*
by
crushing
them
.
Their
great
horses
reared
,
strode
across
the
ranks
,
*NL*
leaped
over
the
bayonets
and
fell
,
gigantic
,
in
the
midst
of
these
four
*NL*
living
wells
.
The
cannon-balls
ploughed
furrows
in
these
cuirassiers
;
*NL*
the
cuirassiers
made
breaches
in
the
squares
.
Files
of
men
disappeared
,
*NL*
ground
to
dust
under
the
horses
.
The
bayonets
plunged
into
the
bellies
*NL*
of
these
centaurs
;
hence
a
hideousness
of
wounds
which
has
probably
*NL*
never
been
seen
anywhere
else
.
The
squares
,
wasted
by
this
mad
cavalry
,
*NL*
closed
up
their
ranks
without
flinching
.
Inexhaustible
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
grape-shot
,
they
created
explosions
in
their
assailants
'
midst
.
The
form
*NL*
of
this
combat
was
monstrous
.
These
squares
were
no
longer
battalions
,
*NL*
they
were
craters
;
those
cuirassiers
were
no
longer
cavalry
,
they
were
*NL*
a
tempest
.
Each
square
was
a
volcano
attacked
by
a
cloud
;
lava
contended
*NL*
with
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
square
on
the
extreme
right
,
the
most
exposed
of
all
,
being
in
the
*NL*
air
,
was
almost
annihilated
at
the
very
first
shock
.
lt
was
formed
*NL*
of
the
75th
regiment
of
Highlanders
.
The
bagpipe-player
in
the
centre
*NL*
dropped
his
melancholy
eyes
,
filled
with
the
reflections
of
the
*NL*
forests
and
the
lakes
,
in
profound
inattention
,
while
men
were
being
*NL*
exterminated
around
him
,
and
seated
on
a
drum
,
with
his
pibroch
under
*NL*
his
arm
,
played
the
Highland
airs
.
These
Scotchmen
died
thinking
of
Ben
*NL*
Lothian
,
as
did
the
Greeks
recalling
Argos
.
The
sword
of
a
cuirassier
,
*NL*
which
hewed
down
the
bagpipes
and
the
arm
which
bore
it
,
put
an
end
to
*NL*
the
song
by
killing
the
singer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cuirassiers
,
relatively
few
in
number
,
and
still
further
diminished
*NL*
by
the
catastrophe
of
the
ravine
,
had
almost
the
whole
English
army
*NL*
against
them
,
but
they
multiplied
themselves
so
that
each
man
of
them
*NL*
was
equal
to
ten
.
Nevertheless
,
some
Hanoverian
battalions
yielded
.
*NL*
Wellington
perceived
it
,
and
thought
of
his
cavalry
.
Had
Napoleon
at
*NL*
that
same
moment
thought
of
his
infantry
,
he
would
have
won
the
battle
.
*NL*
This
forgetfulness
was
his
great
and
fatal
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
the
cuirassiers
,
who
had
been
the
assailants
,
found
*NL*
themselves
assailed
.
The
English
cavalry
was
at
their
back
.
Before
*NL*
them
two
squares
,
behind
them
Somerset
;
Somerset
meant
fourteen
hundred
*NL*
dragoons
of
the
guard
.
On
the
right
,
Somerset
had
Dornberg
with
the
*NL*
German
light-horse
,
and
on
his
left
,
Trip
with
the
Belgian
carabineers
;
*NL*
the
cuirassiers
attacked
on
the
flank
and
in
front
,
before
and
in
the
*NL*
rear
,
by
infantry
and
cavalry
,
had
to
face
all
sides
.
What
mattered
it
*NL*
to
them
?
They
were
a
whirlwind
.
Their
valor
was
something
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
this
,
they
had
behind
them
the
battery
,
which
was
still
*NL*
thundering
.
It
was
necessary
that
it
should
be
so
,
or
they
could
never
*NL*
have
been
wounded
in
the
back
.
One
of
their
cuirasses
,
pierced
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
by
a
ball
from
a
biscayan
,

-RSB-
is
in
the
collection
of
the
*NL*
Waterloo
Museum
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
such
Frenchmen
nothing
less
than
such
Englishmen
was
needed
.
It
*NL*
was
no
longer
a
hand-to-hand
conflict
;
it
was
a
shadow
,
a
fury
,
a
dizzy
*NL*
transport
of
souls
and
courage
,
a
hurricane
of
lightning
swords
.
In
an
*NL*
instant
the
fourteen
hundred
dragoon
guards
numbered
only
eight
hundred
.
*NL*
Fuller
,
their
lieutenant-colonel
,
fell
dead
.
Ney
rushed
up
with
*NL*
the
lancers
and
Lefebvre-Desnouettes
's
light-horse
.
The
plateau
*NL*
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
was
captured
,
recaptured
,
captured
again
.
The
*NL*
cuirassiers
quitted
the
cavalry
to
return
to
the
infantry
;
or
,
to
put
*NL*
it
more
exactly
,
the
whole
of
that
formidable
rout
collared
each
other
*NL*
without
releasing
the
other
.
The
squares
still
held
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
dozen
assaults
.
Ney
had
four
horses
killed
under
him
.
Half
*NL*
the
cuirassiers
remained
on
the
plateau
.
This
conflict
lasted
two
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
English
army
was
profoundly
shaken
.
There
is
no
doubt
that
,
had
they
*NL*
not
been
enfeebled
in
their
first
shock
by
the
disaster
of
the
hollow
*NL*
road
the
cuirassiers
would
have
overwhelmed
the
centre
and
decided
the
*NL*
victory
.
This
extraordinary
cavalry
petrified
Clinton
,
who
had
seen
*NL*
Talavera
and
Badajoz
.
Wellington
,
three-quarters
vanquished
,
admired
*NL*
heroically
.
He
said
in
an
undertone
,
``
Sublime
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cuirassiers
annihilated
seven
squares
out
of
thirteen
,
took
or
*NL*
spiked
sixty
pieces
of
ordnance
,
and
captured
from
the
English
regiments
*NL*
six
flags
,
which
three
cuirassiers
and
three
chasseurs
of
the
Guard
bore
*NL*
to
the
Emperor
,
in
front
of
the
farm
of
La
Belle
Alliance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
's
situation
had
grown
worse
.
This
strange
battle
was
like
a
*NL*
duel
between
two
raging
,
wounded
men
,
each
of
whom
,
still
fighting
and
*NL*
still
resisting
,
is
expending
all
his
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
of
the
two
will
be
the
first
to
fall
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
conflict
on
the
plateau
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
become
of
the
cuirassiers
?
No
one
could
have
told
.
One
thing
*NL*
is
certain
,
that
on
the
day
after
the
battle
,
a
cuirassier
and
his
*NL*
horse
were
found
dead
among
the
woodwork
of
the
scales
for
vehicles
at
*NL*
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
at
the
very
point
where
the
four
roads
from
Nivelles
,
*NL*
Genappe
,
La
Hulpe
,
and
Brussels
meet
and
intersect
each
other
.
This
*NL*
horseman
had
pierced
the
English
lines
.
One
of
the
men
who
picked
up
the
*NL*
body
still
lives
at
Mont-Saint-Jean
.
His
name
is
Dehaze
.
He
was
eighteen
*NL*
years
old
at
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
felt
that
he
was
yielding
.
The
crisis
was
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cuirassiers
had
not
succeeded
,
since
the
centre
was
not
broken
*NL*
through
.
As
every
one
was
in
possession
of
the
plateau
,
no
one
held
it
,
*NL*
and
in
fact
it
remained
,
to
a
great
extent
,
with
the
English
.
Wellington
*NL*
held
the
village
and
the
culminating
plain
;
Ney
had
only
the
crest
and
*NL*
the
slope
.
They
seemed
rooted
in
that
fatal
soil
on
both
sides
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
weakening
of
the
English
seemed
irremediable
.
The
bleeding
*NL*
of
that
army
was
horrible
.
Kempt
,
on
the
left
wing
,
demanded
*NL*
reinforcements
.
``
There
are
none
,
''
replied
Wellington
;
``
he
must
let
*NL*
himself
be
killed
!
''
Almost
at
that
same
moment
,
a
singular
coincidence
*NL*
which
paints
the
exhaustion
of
the
two
armies
,
Ney
demanded
infantry
*NL*
from
Napoleon
,
and
Napoleon
exclaimed
,
``
Infantry
!
Where
does
he
expect
*NL*
me
to
get
it
?
Does
he
think
I
can
make
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
English
army
was
in
the
worse
case
of
the
two
.
The
*NL*
furious
onsets
of
those
great
squadrons
with
cuirasses
of
iron
and
*NL*
breasts
of
steel
had
ground
the
infantry
to
nothing
.
A
few
men
clustered
*NL*
round
a
flag
marked
the
post
of
a
regiment
;
such
and
such
a
battalion
*NL*
was
commanded
only
by
a
captain
or
a
lieutenant
;
Alten
's
division
,
*NL*
already
so
roughly
handled
at
La
Haie-Sainte
,
was
almost
destroyed
;
*NL*
the
intrepid
Belgians
of
Van
Kluze
's
brigade
strewed
the
rye-fields
*NL*
all
along
the
Nivelles
road
;
hardly
anything
was
left
of
those
Dutch
*NL*
grenadiers
,
who
,
intermingled
with
Spaniards
in
our
ranks
in
1811
,
*NL*
fought
against
Wellington
;
and
who
,
in
1815
,
rallied
to
the
*NL*
English
standard
,
fought
against
Napoleon
.
The
loss
in
officers
was
*NL*
considerable
.
Lord
Uxbridge
,
who
had
his
leg
buried
on
the
following
*NL*
day
,
had
his
knee
shattered
.
If
,
on
the
French
side
,
in
that
tussle
*NL*
of
the
cuirassiers
,
Delort
,
l'Heritier
,
Colbert
,
Dnop
,
Travers
,
and
*NL*
Blancard
were
disabled
,
on
the
side
of
the
English
there
was
Alten
*NL*
wounded
,
Barne
wounded
,
Delancey
killed
,
Van
Meeren
killed
,
Ompteda
*NL*
killed
,
the
whole
of
Wellington
's
staff
decimated
,
and
England
had
the
*NL*
worse
of
it
in
that
bloody
scale
.
The
second
regiment
of
foot-guards
*NL*
had
lost
five
lieutenant-colonels
,
four
captains
,
and
three
ensigns
;
*NL*
the
first
battalion
of
the
30th
infantry
had
lost
24
officers
and
1,200
*NL*
soldiers
;
the
79th
Highlanders
had
lost
24
officers
wounded
,
18
officers
*NL*
killed
,
450
soldiers
killed
.
The
Hanoverian
hussars
of
Cumberland
,
a
*NL*
whole
regiment
,
with
Colonel
Hacke
at
its
head
,
who
was
destined
to
be
*NL*
tried
later
on
and
cashiered
,
had
turned
bridle
in
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
fray
,
and
had
fled
to
the
forest
of
Soignes
,
sowing
defeat
all
the
way
*NL*
to
Brussels
.
The
transports
,
ammunition-wagons
,
the
baggage-wagons
,
the
*NL*
wagons
filled
with
wounded
,
on
perceiving
that
the
French
were
gaining
*NL*
ground
and
approaching
the
forest
,
rushed
headlong
thither
.
The
Dutch
,
*NL*
mowed
down
by
the
French
cavalry
,
cried
,
``
Alarm
!
''
From
Vert-Coucou
to
*NL*
Groentendael
,
for
a
distance
of
nearly
two
leagues
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
Brussels
,
according
to
the
testimony
of
eye-witnesses
who
are
still
*NL*
alive
,
the
roads
were
encumbered
with
fugitives
.
This
panic
was
such
*NL*
that
it
attacked
the
Prince
de
Conde
at
Mechlin
,
and
Louis
XVIII
.
at
*NL*
Ghent
.
With
the
exception
of
the
feeble
reserve
echelonned
behind
the
*NL*
ambulance
established
at
the
farm
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
and
of
Vivian
's
*NL*
and
Vandeleur
's
brigades
,
which
flanked
the
left
wing
,
Wellington
had
*NL*
no
cavalry
left
.
A
number
of
batteries
lay
unhorsed
.
These
facts
are
*NL*
attested
by
Siborne
;
and
Pringle
,
exaggerating
the
disaster
,
goes
so
far
*NL*
as
to
say
that
the
Anglo-Dutch
army
was
reduced
to
thirty-four
thousand
*NL*
men
.
The
Iron
Duke
remained
calm
,
but
his
lips
blanched
.
Vincent
,
the
*NL*
Austrian
commissioner
,
Alava
,
the
Spanish
commissioner
,
who
were
present
*NL*
at
the
battle
in
the
English
staff
,
thought
the
Duke
lost
.
At
five
*NL*
o'clock
Wellington
drew
out
his
watch
,
and
he
was
heard
to
murmur
these
*NL*
sinister
words
,
``
Blucher
,
or
night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
about
that
moment
that
a
distant
line
of
bayonets
gleamed
on
*NL*
the
heights
in
the
direction
of
Frischemont
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
comes
the
change
of
face
in
this
giant
drama

CHAPTER
XI
--
A
BAD
GUIDE
TO
NAPOLEON
;
A
GOOD
GUIDE
TO
BULOW
*NL*
*NL*
The
painful
surprise
of
Napoleon
is
well
known
.
Grouchy
hoped
for
,
*NL*
Blucher
arriving
.
Death
instead
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fate
has
these
turns
;
the
throne
of
the
world
was
expected
;
it
was
Saint
*NL*
Helena
that
was
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
little
shepherd
who
served
as
guide
to
Bulow
,
Blucher
's
*NL*
lieutenant
,
had
advised
him
to
debouch
from
the
forest
above
*NL*
Frischemont
,
instead
of
below
Plancenoit
,
the
form
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
might
,
perhaps
,
have
been
different
.
Napoleon
would
have
won
the
*NL*
battle
of
Waterloo
.
By
any
other
route
than
that
below
Plancenoit
,
*NL*
the
Prussian
army
would
have
come
out
upon
a
ravine
impassable
for
*NL*
artillery
,
and
Bulow
would
not
have
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
Prussian
general
,
Muffling
,
declares
that
one
hour
's
delay
,
and
*NL*
Blucher
would
not
have
found
Wellington
on
his
feet
.
``
The
battle
was
*NL*
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
time
that
Bulow
should
arrive
,
as
will
be
seen
.
He
had
,
moreover
,
*NL*
been
very
much
delayed
.
He
had
bivouacked
at
Dion-le-Mont
,
and
had
set
*NL*
out
at
daybreak
;
but
the
roads
were
impassable
,
and
his
divisions
stuck
*NL*
fast
in
the
mire
.
The
ruts
were
up
to
the
hubs
of
the
cannons
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
he
had
been
obliged
to
pass
the
Dyle
on
the
narrow
bridge
of
Wavre
;
*NL*
the
street
leading
to
the
bridge
had
been
fired
by
the
French
,
so
*NL*
the
caissons
and
ammunition-wagons
could
not
pass
between
two
rows
of
*NL*
burning
houses
,
and
had
been
obliged
to
wait
until
the
conflagration
was
*NL*
extinguished
.
It
was
mid-day
before
Bulow
's
vanguard
had
been
able
to
*NL*
reach
Chapelle-Saint-Lambert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
action
been
begun
two
hours
earlier
,
it
would
have
been
over
*NL*
at
four
o'clock
,
and
Blucher
would
have
fallen
on
the
battle
won
by
*NL*
Napoleon
.
Such
are
these
immense
risks
proportioned
to
an
infinite
which
*NL*
we
can
not
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Emperor
had
been
the
first
,
as
early
as
mid-day
,
to
descry
with
his
*NL*
field-glass
,
on
the
extreme
horizon
,
something
which
had
attracted
his
*NL*
attention
.
He
had
said
,
``
I
see
yonder
a
cloud
,
which
seems
to
me
to
be
*NL*
troops
.
''
Then
he
asked
the
Duc
de
Dalmatie
,
``
Soult
,
what
do
you
see
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
Chapelle-Saint-Lambert
?
''
The
marshal
,
levelling
his
*NL*
glass
,
answered
,
``
Four
or
five
thousand
men
,
Sire
;
evidently
Grouchy
.
''
*NL*
But
it
remained
motionless
in
the
mist
.
All
the
glasses
of
the
staff
*NL*
had
studied
``
the
cloud
''
pointed
out
by
the
Emperor
.
Some
said
:
``
It
is
*NL*
trees
.
''
The
truth
is
,
that
the
cloud
did
not
move
.
The
Emperor
detached
*NL*
Domon
's
division
of
light
cavalry
to
reconnoitre
in
that
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bulow
had
not
moved
,
in
fact
.
His
vanguard
was
very
feeble
,
and
could
*NL*
accomplish
nothing
.
He
was
obliged
to
wait
for
the
body
of
the
army
*NL*
corps
,
and
he
had
received
orders
to
concentrate
his
forces
before
*NL*
entering
into
line
;
but
at
five
o'clock
,
perceiving
Wellington
's
peril
,
*NL*
Blucher
ordered
Bulow
to
attack
,
and
uttered
these
remarkable
words
:
``
We
*NL*
must
give
air
to
the
English
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
later
,
the
divisions
of
Losthin
,
Hiller
,
Hacke
,
and
Ryssel
*NL*
deployed
before
Lobau
's
corps
,
the
cavalry
of
Prince
William
of
Prussia
*NL*
debouched
from
the
forest
of
Paris
,
Plancenoit
was
in
flames
,
and
the
*NL*
Prussian
cannon-balls
began
to
rain
even
upon
the
ranks
of
the
guard
in
*NL*
reserve
behind
Napoleon
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
THE
GUARD
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
knows
the
rest
,
--
the
irruption
of
a
third
army
;
the
battle
*NL*
broken
to
pieces
;
eighty-six
mouths
of
fire
thundering
simultaneously
;
*NL*
Pirch
the
first
coming
up
with
Bulow
;
Zieten
's
cavalry
led
by
Blucher
*NL*
in
person
,
the
French
driven
back
;
Marcognet
swept
from
the
plateau
of
*NL*
Ohain
;
Durutte
dislodged
from
Papelotte
;
Donzelot
and
Quiot
retreating
;
*NL*
Lobau
caught
on
the
flank
;
a
fresh
battle
precipitating
itself
on
our
*NL*
dismantled
regiments
at
nightfall
;
the
whole
English
line
resuming
the
*NL*
offensive
and
thrust
forward
;
the
gigantic
breach
made
in
the
French
*NL*
army
;
the
English
grape-shot
and
the
Prussian
grape-shot
aiding
each
*NL*
other
;
the
extermination
;
disaster
in
front
;
disaster
on
the
flank
;
the
*NL*
Guard
entering
the
line
in
the
midst
of
this
terrible
crumbling
of
all
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conscious
that
they
were
about
to
die
,
they
shouted
,
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
*NL*
History
records
nothing
more
touching
than
that
agony
bursting
forth
in
*NL*
acclamations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sky
had
been
overcast
all
day
long
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
at
that
very
*NL*
moment
,
--
it
was
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
--
the
clouds
on
the
horizon
*NL*
parted
,
and
allowed
the
grand
and
sinister
glow
of
the
setting
sun
to
*NL*
pass
through
,
athwart
the
elms
on
the
Nivelles
road
.
They
had
seen
it
*NL*
rise
at
Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
battalion
of
the
Guard
was
commanded
by
a
general
for
this
final
*NL*
catastrophe
.
Friant
,
Michel
,
Roguet
,
Harlet
,
Mallet
,
Poret
de
Morvan
,
*NL*
were
there
.
When
the
tall
caps
of
the
grenadiers
of
the
Guard
,
with
*NL*
their
large
plaques
bearing
the
eagle
appeared
,
symmetrical
,
in
line
,
*NL*
tranquil
,
in
the
midst
of
that
combat
,
the
enemy
felt
a
respect
for
*NL*
France
;
they
thought
they
beheld
twenty
victories
entering
the
field
*NL*
of
battle
,
with
wings
outspread
,
and
those
who
were
the
conquerors
,
*NL*
believing
themselves
to
be
vanquished
,
retreated
;
but
Wellington
*NL*
shouted
,
``
Up
,
Guards
,
and
aim
straight
!
''
The
red
regiment
of
English
*NL*
guards
,
lying
flat
behind
the
hedges
,
sprang
up
,
a
cloud
of
grape-shot
*NL*
riddled
the
tricolored
flag
and
whistled
round
our
eagles
;
all
hurled
*NL*
themselves
forwards
,
and
the
final
carnage
began
.
In
the
darkness
,
the
*NL*
Imperial
Guard
felt
the
army
losing
ground
around
it
,
and
in
the
vast
*NL*
shock
of
the
rout
it
heard
the
desperate
flight
which
had
taken
the
*NL*
place
of
the
``
Vive
l'Empereur
!
''
and
,
with
flight
behind
it
,
it
continued
*NL*
to
advance
,
more
crushed
,
losing
more
men
at
every
step
that
it
took
.
*NL*
There
were
none
who
hesitated
,
no
timid
men
in
its
ranks
.
The
soldier
in
*NL*
that
troop
was
as
much
of
a
hero
as
the
general
.
Not
a
man
was
missing
*NL*
in
that
suicide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ney
,
bewildered
,
great
with
all
the
grandeur
of
accepted
death
,
offered
*NL*
himself
to
all
blows
in
that
tempest
.
He
had
his
fifth
horse
killed
*NL*
under
him
there
.
Perspiring
,
his
eyes
aflame
,
foaming
at
the
mouth
,
with
*NL*
uniform
unbuttoned
,
one
of
his
epaulets
half
cut
off
by
a
sword-stroke
*NL*
from
a
horseguard
,
his
plaque
with
the
great
eagle
dented
by
a
bullet
;
*NL*
bleeding
,
bemired
,
magnificent
,
a
broken
sword
in
his
hand
,
he
said
,
*NL*
``
Come
and
see
how
a
Marshal
of
France
dies
on
the
field
of
battle
!
''
But
*NL*
in
vain
;
he
did
not
die
.
He
was
haggard
and
angry
.
At
Drouet
d'Erlon
he
*NL*
hurled
this
question
,
``
Are
you
not
going
to
get
yourself
killed
?
''
In
*NL*
the
midst
of
all
that
artillery
engaged
in
crushing
a
handful
of
men
,
*NL*
he
shouted
:
``
So
there
is
nothing
for
me
!
Oh
!
I
should
like
to
have
all
*NL*
these
English
bullets
enter
my
bowels
!
''
Unhappy
man
,
thou
wert
reserved
*NL*
for
French
bullets
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XIII
--
THE
CATASTROPHE
*NL*
*NL*
The
rout
behind
the
Guard
was
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
army
yielded
suddenly
on
all
sides
at
once
,
--
Hougomont
,
La
*NL*
Haie-Sainte
,
Papelotte
,
Plancenoit
.
The
cry
``
Treachery
!
''
was
followed
by
*NL*
a
cry
of
``
Save
yourselves
who
can
!
''
An
army
which
is
disbanding
is
*NL*
like
a
thaw
.
All
yields
,
splits
,
cracks
,
floats
,
rolls
,
falls
,
jostles
,
*NL*
hastens
,
is
precipitated
.
The
disintegration
is
unprecedented
.
Ney
*NL*
borrows
a
horse
,
leaps
upon
it
,
and
without
hat
,
cravat
,
or
sword
,
*NL*
places
himself
across
the
Brussels
road
,
stopping
both
English
and
*NL*
French
.
He
strives
to
detain
the
army
,
he
recalls
it
to
its
duty
,
he
*NL*
insults
it
,
he
clings
to
the
rout
.
He
is
overwhelmed
.
The
soldiers
fly
*NL*
from
him
,
shouting
,
``
Long
live
Marshal
Ney
!
''
Two
of
Durutte
's
regiments
*NL*
go
and
come
in
affright
as
though
tossed
back
and
forth
between
the
*NL*
swords
of
the
Uhlans
and
the
fusillade
of
the
brigades
of
Kempt
,
Best
,
*NL*
Pack
,
and
Rylandt
;
the
worst
of
hand-to-hand
conflicts
is
the
defeat
;
*NL*
friends
kill
each
other
in
order
to
escape
;
squadrons
and
battalions
*NL*
break
and
disperse
against
each
other
,
like
the
tremendous
foam
of
*NL*
battle
.
Lobau
at
one
extremity
,
and
Reille
at
the
other
,
are
drawn
into
*NL*
the
tide
.
In
vain
does
Napoleon
erect
walls
from
what
is
left
to
him
of
*NL*
his
Guard
;
in
vain
does
he
expend
in
a
last
effort
his
last
serviceable
*NL*
squadrons
.
Quiot
retreats
before
Vivian
,
Kellermann
before
Vandeleur
,
*NL*
Lobau
before
Bulow
,
Morand
before
Pirch
,
Domon
and
Subervic
before
*NL*
Prince
William
of
Prussia
;
Guyot
,
who
led
the
Emperor
's
squadrons
to
the
*NL*
charge
,
falls
beneath
the
feet
of
the
English
dragoons
.
Napoleon
gallops
*NL*
past
the
line
of
fugitives
,
harangues
,
urges
,
threatens
,
entreats
*NL*
them
.
All
the
mouths
which
in
the
morning
had
shouted
,
``
Long
live
*NL*
the
Emperor
!
''
remain
gaping
;
they
hardly
recognize
him
.
The
Prussian
*NL*
cavalry
,
newly
arrived
,
dashes
forwards
,
flies
,
hews
,
slashes
,
kills
,
*NL*
exterminates
.
Horses
lash
out
,
the
cannons
flee
;
the
soldiers
of
the
*NL*
artillery-train
unharness
the
caissons
and
use
the
horses
to
make
their
*NL*
escape
;
transports
overturned
,
with
all
four
wheels
in
the
air
,
clog
the
*NL*
road
and
occasion
massacres
.
Men
are
crushed
,
trampled
down
,
others
walk
*NL*
over
the
dead
and
the
living
.
Arms
are
lost
.
A
dizzy
multitude
fills
the
*NL*
roads
,
the
paths
,
the
bridges
,
the
plains
,
the
hills
,
the
valleys
,
*NL*
the
woods
,
encumbered
by
this
invasion
of
forty
thousand
men
.
Shouts
*NL*
despair
,
knapsacks
and
guns
flung
among
the
rye
,
passages
forced
at
*NL*
the
point
of
the
sword
,
no
more
comrades
,
no
more
officers
,
no
more
*NL*
generals
,
an
inexpressible
terror
.
Zieten
putting
France
to
the
sword
at
*NL*
its
leisure
.
Lions
converted
into
goats
.
Such
was
the
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Genappe
,
an
effort
was
made
to
wheel
about
,
to
present
a
battle
*NL*
front
,
to
draw
up
in
line
.
Lobau
rallied
three
hundred
men
.
The
entrance
*NL*
to
the
village
was
barricaded
,
but
at
the
first
volley
of
Prussian
*NL*
canister
,
all
took
to
flight
again
,
and
Lobau
was
taken
.
That
volley
of
*NL*
grape-shot
can
be
seen
to-day
imprinted
on
the
ancient
gable
of
a
brick
*NL*
building
on
the
right
of
the
road
at
a
few
minutes
'
distance
before
you
*NL*
enter
Genappe
.
The
Prussians
threw
themselves
into
Genappe
,
furious
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
that
they
were
not
more
entirely
the
conquerors
.
The
pursuit
was
*NL*
stupendous
.
Blucher
ordered
extermination
.
Roguet
had
set
the
lugubrious
*NL*
example
of
threatening
with
death
any
French
grenadier
who
should
bring
*NL*
him
a
Prussian
prisoner
.
Blucher
outdid
Roguet
.
Duhesme
,
the
general
*NL*
of
the
Young
Guard
,
hemmed
in
at
the
doorway
of
an
inn
at
Genappe
,
*NL*
surrendered
his
sword
to
a
huzzar
of
death
,
who
took
the
sword
and
slew
*NL*
the
prisoner
.
The
victory
was
completed
by
the
assassination
of
the
*NL*
vanquished
.
Let
us
inflict
punishment
,
since
we
are
history
:
old
*NL*
Blucher
disgraced
himself
.
This
ferocity
put
the
finishing
touch
to
the
*NL*
disaster
.
The
desperate
route
traversed
Genappe
,
traversed
Quatre-Bras
,
*NL*
traversed
Gosselies
,
traversed
Frasnes
,
traversed
Charleroi
,
traversed
*NL*
Thuin
,
and
only
halted
at
the
frontier
.
Alas
!
and
who
,
then
,
was
fleeing
*NL*
in
that
manner
?
The
Grand
Army
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
vertigo
,
this
terror
,
this
downfall
into
ruin
of
the
loftiest
*NL*
bravery
which
ever
astounded
history
,
--
is
that
causeless
?
No
.
The
shadow
*NL*
of
an
enormous
right
is
projected
athwart
Waterloo
.
It
is
the
day
of
*NL*
destiny
.
The
force
which
is
mightier
than
man
produced
that
day
.
Hence
*NL*
the
terrified
wrinkle
of
those
brows
;
hence
all
those
great
souls
*NL*
surrendering
their
swords
.
Those
who
had
conquered
Europe
have
fallen
*NL*
prone
on
the
earth
,
with
nothing
left
to
say
nor
to
do
,
feeling
the
*NL*
present
shadow
of
a
terrible
presence
.
Hoc
erat
in
fatis
.
That
day
the
*NL*
perspective
of
the
human
race
underwent
a
change
.
Waterloo
is
the
*NL*
hinge
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
The
disappearance
of
the
great
man
was
*NL*
necessary
to
the
advent
of
the
great
century
.
Some
one
,
a
person
to
whom
*NL*
one
replies
not
,
took
the
responsibility
on
himself
.
The
panic
of
heroes
*NL*
can
be
explained
.
In
the
battle
of
Waterloo
there
is
something
more
than
*NL*
a
cloud
,
there
is
something
of
the
meteor
.
God
has
passed
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nightfall
,
in
a
meadow
near
Genappe
,
Bernard
and
Bertrand
seized
by
*NL*
the
skirt
of
his
coat
and
detained
a
man
,
haggard
,
pensive
,
sinister
,
*NL*
gloomy
,
who
,
dragged
to
that
point
by
the
current
of
the
rout
,
had
just
*NL*
dismounted
,
had
passed
the
bridle
of
his
horse
over
his
arm
,
and
with
*NL*
wild
eye
was
returning
alone
to
Waterloo
.
It
was
Napoleon
,
the
immense
*NL*
somnambulist
of
this
dream
which
had
crumbled
,
essaying
once
more
to
*NL*
advance
.

CHAPTER
XIV
--
THE
LAST
SQUARE
*NL*
*NL*
Several
squares
of
the
Guard
,
motionless
amid
this
stream
of
the
defeat
,
*NL*
as
rocks
in
running
water
,
held
their
own
until
night
.
Night
came
,
*NL*
death
also
;
they
awaited
that
double
shadow
,
and
,
invincible
,
allowed
*NL*
themselves
to
be
enveloped
therein
.
Each
regiment
,
isolated
from
the
*NL*
rest
,
and
having
no
bond
with
the
army
,
now
shattered
in
every
part
,
*NL*
died
alone
.
They
had
taken
up
position
for
this
final
action
,
some
on
*NL*
the
heights
of
Rossomme
,
others
on
the
plain
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
.
There
,
*NL*
abandoned
,
vanquished
,
terrible
,
those
gloomy
squares
endured
their
*NL*
death-throes
in
formidable
fashion
.
Ulm
,
Wagram
,
Jena
,
Friedland
,
died
*NL*
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
twilight
,
towards
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
one
of
them
was
left
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
plateau
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
.
In
that
fatal
valley
,
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
that
declivity
which
the
cuirassiers
had
ascended
,
now
*NL*
inundated
by
the
masses
of
the
English
,
under
the
converging
fires
*NL*
of
the
victorious
hostile
cavalry
,
under
a
frightful
density
of
*NL*
projectiles
,
this
square
fought
on
.
It
was
commanded
by
an
obscure
*NL*
officer
named
Cambronne
.
At
each
discharge
,
the
square
diminished
and
*NL*
replied
.
It
replied
to
the
grape-shot
with
a
fusillade
,
continually
*NL*
contracting
its
four
walls
.
The
fugitives
pausing
breathless
for
a
*NL*
moment
in
the
distance
,
listened
in
the
darkness
to
that
gloomy
and
*NL*
ever-decreasing
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
legion
had
been
reduced
to
a
handful
,
when
nothing
was
left
*NL*
of
their
flag
but
a
rag
,
when
their
guns
,
the
bullets
all
gone
,
were
no
*NL*
longer
anything
but
clubs
,
when
the
heap
of
corpses
was
larger
than
the
*NL*
group
of
survivors
,
there
reigned
among
the
conquerors
,
around
those
men
*NL*
dying
so
sublimely
,
a
sort
of
sacred
terror
,
and
the
English
artillery
,
*NL*
taking
breath
,
became
silent
.
This
furnished
a
sort
of
respite
.
These
*NL*
combatants
had
around
them
something
in
the
nature
of
a
swarm
of
*NL*
spectres
,
silhouettes
of
men
on
horseback
,
the
black
profiles
of
cannon
,
*NL*
the
white
sky
viewed
through
wheels
and
gun-carriages
,
the
colossal
*NL*
death
's
-
head
,
which
the
heroes
saw
constantly
through
the
smoke
,
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
battle
,
advanced
upon
them
and
gazed
at
them
.
Through
the
*NL*
shades
of
twilight
they
could
hear
the
pieces
being
loaded
;
the
matches
*NL*
all
lighted
,
like
the
eyes
of
tigers
at
night
,
formed
a
circle
round
*NL*
their
heads
;
all
the
lintstocks
of
the
English
batteries
approached
the
*NL*
cannons
,
and
then
,
with
emotion
,
holding
the
supreme
moment
suspended
*NL*
above
these
men
,
an
English
general
,
Colville
according
to
some
,
*NL*
Maitland
according
to
others
,
shouted
to
them
,
``
Surrender

brave

Frenchmen

CHAPTER
XV
--
CAMBRONNE
*NL*
*NL*
If
any
French
reader
object
to
having
his
susceptibilities
offended
,
one
*NL*
would
have
to
refrain
from
repeating
in
his
presence
what
is
perhaps
*NL*
the
finest
reply
that
a
Frenchman
ever
made
.
This
would
enjoin
us
from
*NL*
consigning
something
sublime
to
History
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
our
own
risk
and
peril
,
let
us
violate
this
injunction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
then
,
among
those
giants
there
was
one
Titan
,
--
Cambronne
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
that
reply
and
then
perish
,
what
could
be
grander
?
For
being
*NL*
willing
to
die
is
the
same
as
to
die
;
and
it
was
not
this
man
's
fault
if
*NL*
he
survived
after
he
was
shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winner
of
the
battle
of
Waterloo
was
not
Napoleon
,
who
was
put
to
*NL*
flight
;
nor
Wellington
,
giving
way
at
four
o'clock
,
in
despair
at
five
;
*NL*
nor
Blucher
,
who
took
no
part
in
the
engagement
.
The
winner
of
Waterloo
*NL*
was
Cambronne
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
thunder
forth
such
a
reply
at
the
lightning-flash
that
kills
you
is
*NL*
to
conquer
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
to
answer
the
Catastrophe
,
thus
to
speak
to
Fate
,
to
give
this
*NL*
pedestal
to
the
future
lion
,
to
hurl
such
a
challenge
to
the
midnight
*NL*
rainstorm
,
to
the
treacherous
wall
of
Hougomont
,
to
the
sunken
road
of
*NL*
Ohain
,
to
Grouchy
's
delay
,
to
Blucher
's
arrival
,
to
be
Irony
itself
in
*NL*
the
tomb
,
to
act
so
as
to
stand
upright
though
fallen
,
to
drown
in
*NL*
two
syllables
the
European
coalition
,
to
offer
kings
privies
which
*NL*
the
Caesars
once
knew
,
to
make
the
lowest
of
words
the
most
lofty
by
*NL*
entwining
with
it
the
glory
of
France
,
insolently
to
end
Waterloo
with
*NL*
Mardigras
,
to
finish
Leonidas
with
Rabellais
,
to
set
the
crown
on
this
*NL*
victory
by
a
word
impossible
to
speak
,
to
lose
the
field
and
preserve
*NL*
history
,
to
have
the
laugh
on
your
side
after
such
a
carnage
,
--
this
is
*NL*
immense
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
insult
such
as
a
thunder-cloud
might
hurl
!
It
reaches
the
*NL*
grandeur
of
AEschylus
!
*NL*
*NL*
Cambronne
's
reply
produces
the
effect
of
a
violent
break
.
'T
is
like
the
*NL*
breaking
of
a
heart
under
a
weight
of
scorn
.
'T
is
the
overflow
of
agony
*NL*
bursting
forth
.
Who
conquered
?
Wellington
?
No
!
Had
it
not
been
for
*NL*
Blucher
,
he
was
lost
.
Was
it
Blucher
?
No
!
If
Wellington
had
not
begun
,
*NL*
Blucher
could
not
have
finished
.
This
Cambronne
,
this
man
spending
his
*NL*
last
hour
,
this
unknown
soldier
,
this
infinitesimal
of
war
,
realizes
*NL*
that
here
is
a
falsehood
,
a
falsehood
in
a
catastrophe
,
and
so
doubly
*NL*
agonizing
;
and
at
the
moment
when
his
rage
is
bursting
forth
because
of
*NL*
it
,
he
is
offered
this
mockery
,
--
life
!
How
could
he
restrain
himself
?
*NL*
Yonder
are
all
the
kings
of
Europe
,
the
general
's
flushed
with
victory
,
*NL*
the
Jupiter
's
darting
thunderbolts
;
they
have
a
hundred
thousand
*NL*
victorious
soldiers
,
and
back
of
the
hundred
thousand
a
million
;
their
*NL*
cannon
stand
with
yawning
mouths
,
the
match
is
lighted
;
they
grind
down
*NL*
under
their
heels
the
Imperial
guards
,
and
the
grand
army
;
they
have
*NL*
just
crushed
Napoleon
,
and
only
Cambronne
remains
,
--
only
this
earthworm
*NL*
is
left
to
protest
.
He
will
protest
.
Then
he
seeks
for
the
appropriate
*NL*
word
as
one
seeks
for
a
sword
.
His
mouth
froths
,
and
the
froth
is
the
*NL*
word
.
In
face
of
this
mean
and
mighty
victory
,
in
face
of
this
victory
*NL*
which
counts
none
victorious
,
this
desperate
soldier
stands
erect
.
He
*NL*
grants
its
overwhelming
immensity
,
but
he
establishes
its
triviality
;
*NL*
and
he
does
more
than
spit
upon
it
.
Borne
down
by
numbers
,
by
superior
*NL*
force
,
by
brute
matter
,
he
finds
in
his
soul
an
expression
:
``
Excrement
!
''
*NL*
We
repeat
it
,
--
to
use
that
word
,
to
do
thus
,
to
invent
such
an
*NL*
expression
,
is
to
be
the
conqueror
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
spirit
of
mighty
days
at
that
portentous
moment
made
its
descent
*NL*
on
that
unknown
man
.
Cambronne
invents
the
word
for
Waterloo
as
Rouget
*NL*
invents
the
``
Marseillaise
,
''
under
the
visitation
of
a
breath
from
on
*NL*
high
.
An
emanation
from
the
divine
whirlwind
leaps
forth
and
comes
*NL*
sweeping
over
these
men
,
and
they
shake
,
and
one
of
them
sings
the
song
*NL*
supreme
,
and
the
other
utters
the
frightful
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
challenge
of
titanic
scorn
Cambronne
hurls
not
only
at
Europe
in
*NL*
the
name
of
the
Empire
,
--
that
would
be
a
trifle
:
he
hurls
it
at
the
past
*NL*
in
the
name
of
the
Revolution
.
It
is
heard
,
and
Cambronne
is
recognized
*NL*
as
possessed
by
the
ancient
spirit
of
the
Titans
.
Danton
seems
to
be
*NL*
speaking
!
Kleber
seems
to
be
bellowing
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
word
from
Cambronne
,
the
English
voice
responded
,
``
Fire
!
''
*NL*
The
batteries
flamed
,
the
hill
trembled
,
from
all
those
brazen
mouths
*NL*
belched
a
last
terrible
gush
of
grape-shot
;
a
vast
volume
of
smoke
,
*NL*
vaguely
white
in
the
light
of
the
rising
moon
,
rolled
out
,
and
when
the
*NL*
smoke
dispersed
,
there
was
no
longer
anything
there
.
That
formidable
*NL*
remnant
had
been
annihilated
;
the
Guard
was
dead
.
The
four
walls
of
the
*NL*
living
redoubt
lay
prone
,
and
hardly
was
there
discernible
,
here
and
*NL*
there
,
even
a
quiver
in
the
bodies
;
it
was
thus
that
the
French
legions
,
*NL*
greater
than
the
Roman
legions
,
expired
on
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
on
the
soil
*NL*
watered
with
rain
and
blood
,
amid
the
gloomy
grain
,
on
the
spot
where
*NL*
nowadays
Joseph
,
who
drives
the
post-wagon
from
Nivelles
,
passes
*NL*
whistling
,
and
cheerfully
whipping
up
his
horse
at
four
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning

The
battle
of
Waterloo
is
an
enigma
.
It
is
as
obscure
to
those
who
won
*NL*
it
as
to
those
who
lost
it
.
For
Napoleon
it
was
a
panic
;
-LSB-
10
-RSB-
Blucher
*NL*
sees
nothing
in
it
but
fire
;
Wellington
understands
nothing
in
regard
*NL*
to
it
.
Look
at
the
reports
.
The
bulletins
are
confused
,
the
commentaries
*NL*
involved
.
Some
stammer
,
others
lisp
.
Jomini
divides
the
battle
of
*NL*
Waterloo
into
four
moments
;
Muffling
cuts
it
up
into
three
changes
;
*NL*
Charras
alone
,
though
we
hold
another
judgment
than
his
on
some
points
,
*NL*
seized
with
his
haughty
glance
the
characteristic
outlines
of
that
*NL*
catastrophe
of
human
genius
in
conflict
with
divine
chance
.
All
the
*NL*
other
historians
suffer
from
being
somewhat
dazzled
,
and
in
this
dazzled
*NL*
state
they
fumble
about
.
It
was
a
day
of
lightning
brilliancy
;
in
fact
,
*NL*
a
crumbling
of
the
military
monarchy
which
,
to
the
vast
stupefaction
of
*NL*
kings
,
drew
all
the
kingdoms
after
it
--
the
fall
of
force
,
the
defeat
of
*NL*
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
event
,
stamped
with
superhuman
necessity
,
the
part
played
by
men
*NL*
amounts
to
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
take
Waterloo
from
Wellington
and
Blucher
,
do
we
thereby
deprive
*NL*
England
and
Germany
of
anything
?
No
.
Neither
that
illustrious
England
*NL*
nor
that
august
Germany
enter
into
the
problem
of
Waterloo
.
Thank
*NL*
Heaven
,
nations
are
great
,
independently
of
the
lugubrious
feats
of
*NL*
the
sword
.
Neither
England
,
nor
Germany
,
nor
France
is
contained
in
*NL*
a
scabbard
.
At
this
epoch
when
Waterloo
is
only
a
clashing
of
swords
,
*NL*
above
Blucher
,
Germany
has
Schiller
;
above
Wellington
,
England
has
*NL*
Byron
.
A
vast
dawn
of
ideas
is
the
peculiarity
of
our
century
,
and
in
*NL*
that
aurora
England
and
Germany
have
a
magnificent
radiance
.
They
*NL*
are
majestic
because
they
think
.
The
elevation
of
level
which
they
*NL*
contribute
to
civilization
is
intrinsic
with
them
;
it
proceeds
from
*NL*
themselves
and
not
from
an
accident
.
The
aggrandizement
which
they
have
*NL*
brought
to
the
nineteenth
century
has
not
Waterloo
as
its
source
.
It
is
*NL*
only
barbarous
peoples
who
undergo
rapid
growth
after
a
victory
.
That
is
*NL*
the
temporary
vanity
of
torrents
swelled
by
a
storm
.
Civilized
people
,
*NL*
especially
in
our
day
,
are
neither
elevated
nor
abased
by
the
good
or
*NL*
bad
fortune
of
a
captain
.
Their
specific
gravity
in
the
human
species
*NL*
results
from
something
more
than
a
combat
.
Their
honor
,
thank
God
!
their
*NL*
dignity
,
their
intelligence
,
their
genius
,
are
not
numbers
which
those
*NL*
gamblers
,
heroes
and
conquerors
,
can
put
in
the
lottery
of
battles
.
*NL*
Often
a
battle
is
lost
and
progress
is
conquered
.
There
is
less
glory
*NL*
and
more
liberty
.
The
drum
holds
its
peace
;
reason
takes
the
word
.
It
is
*NL*
a
game
in
which
he
who
loses
wins
.
Let
us
,
therefore
,
speak
of
Waterloo
*NL*
coldly
from
both
sides
.
Let
us
render
to
chance
that
which
is
due
*NL*
to
chance
,
and
to
God
that
which
is
due
to
God
.
What
is
Waterloo
?
A
*NL*
victory
?
No
.
The
winning
number
in
the
lottery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quine
-LSB-

-RSB-
won
by
Europe
,
paid
by
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
worth
while
to
place
a
lion
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waterloo
,
moreover
,
is
the
strangest
encounter
in
history
.
Napoleon
and
*NL*
Wellington
.
They
are
not
enemies
;
they
are
opposites
.
Never
did
God
,
*NL*
who
is
fond
of
antitheses
,
make
a
more
striking
contrast
,
a
more
*NL*
extraordinary
comparison
.
On
one
side
,
precision
,
foresight
,
geometry
,
*NL*
prudence
,
an
assured
retreat
,
reserves
spared
,
with
an
obstinate
*NL*
coolness
,
an
imperturbable
method
,
strategy
,
which
takes
advantage
*NL*
of
the
ground
,
tactics
,
which
preserve
the
equilibrium
of
battalions
,
*NL*
carnage
,
executed
according
to
rule
,
war
regulated
,
watch
in
hand
,
*NL*
nothing
voluntarily
left
to
chance
,
the
ancient
classic
courage
,
*NL*
absolute
regularity
;
on
the
other
,
intuition
,
divination
,
military
*NL*
oddity
,
superhuman
instinct
,
a
flaming
glance
,
an
indescribable
*NL*
something
which
gazes
like
an
eagle
,
and
which
strikes
like
the
*NL*
lightning
,
a
prodigious
art
in
disdainful
impetuosity
,
all
the
mysteries
*NL*
of
a
profound
soul
,
associated
with
destiny
;
the
stream
,
the
plain
,
the
*NL*
forest
,
the
hill
,
summoned
,
and
in
a
manner
,
forced
to
obey
,
the
despot
*NL*
going
even
so
far
as
to
tyrannize
over
the
field
of
battle
;
faith
in
*NL*
a
star
mingled
with
strategic
science
,
elevating
but
perturbing
it
.
*NL*
Wellington
was
the
Bareme
of
war
;
Napoleon
was
its
Michael
Angelo
;
and
*NL*
on
this
occasion
,
genius
was
vanquished
by
calculation
.
On
both
sides
*NL*
some
one
was
awaited
.
It
was
the
exact
calculator
who
succeeded
.
*NL*
Napoleon
was
waiting
for
Grouchy
;
he
did
not
come
.
Wellington
expected
*NL*
Blucher
;
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
is
classic
war
taking
its
revenge
.
Bonaparte
,
at
his
dawning
,
*NL*
had
encountered
him
in
Italy
,
and
beaten
him
superbly
.
The
old
owl
had
*NL*
fled
before
the
young
vulture
.
The
old
tactics
had
been
not
only
struck
*NL*
as
by
lightning
,
but
disgraced
.
Who
was
that
Corsican
of
six
and
twenty
?
*NL*
What
signified
that
splendid
ignoramus
,
who
,
with
everything
against
*NL*
him
,
nothing
in
his
favor
,
without
provisions
,
without
ammunition
,
*NL*
without
cannon
,
without
shoes
,
almost
without
an
army
,
with
a
mere
*NL*
handful
of
men
against
masses
,
hurled
himself
on
Europe
combined
,
*NL*
and
absurdly
won
victories
in
the
impossible
?
Whence
had
issued
that
*NL*
fulminating
convict
,
who
almost
without
taking
breath
,
and
with
the
same
*NL*
set
of
combatants
in
hand
,
pulverized
,
one
after
the
other
,
the
five
*NL*
armies
of
the
emperor
of
Germany
,
upsetting
Beaulieu
on
Alvinzi
,
Wurmser
*NL*
on
Beaulieu
,
Melas
on
Wurmser
,
Mack
on
Melas
?
Who
was
this
novice
in
*NL*
war
with
the
effrontery
of
a
luminary
?
The
academical
military
school
*NL*
excommunicated
him
,
and
as
it
lost
its
footing
;
hence
,
the
implacable
*NL*
rancor
of
the
old
Caesarism
against
the
new
;
of
the
regular
sword
*NL*
against
the
flaming
sword
;
and
of
the
exchequer
against
genius
.
On
the
*NL*
18th
of
June
,
1815
,
that
rancor
had
the
last
word
.
and
beneath
Lodi
,
*NL*
Montebello
,
Montenotte
,
Mantua
,
Arcola
,
it
wrote
:
Waterloo
.
A
triumph
of
*NL*
the
mediocres
which
is
sweet
to
the
majority
.
Destiny
consented
to
this
*NL*
irony
.
In
his
decline
,
Napoleon
found
Wurmser
,
the
younger
,
again
in
*NL*
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
to
get
Wurmser
,
it
sufficed
to
blanch
the
hair
of
Wellington
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waterloo
is
a
battle
of
the
first
order
,
won
by
a
captain
of
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
must
be
admired
in
the
battle
of
Waterloo
,
is
England
;
the
*NL*
English
firmness
,
the
English
resolution
,
the
English
blood
;
the
superb
*NL*
thing
about
England
there
,
no
offence
to
her
,
was
herself
.
It
was
not
*NL*
her
captain
;
it
was
her
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wellington
,
oddly
ungrateful
,
declares
in
a
letter
to
Lord
Bathurst
,
*NL*
that
his
army
,
the
army
which
fought
on
the
18th
of
June
,
1815
,
was
a
*NL*
``
detestable
army
.
''
What
does
that
sombre
intermingling
of
bones
buried
*NL*
beneath
the
furrows
of
Waterloo
think
of
that
?
*NL*
*NL*
England
has
been
too
modest
in
the
matter
of
Wellington
.
To
make
*NL*
Wellington
so
great
is
to
belittle
England
.
Wellington
is
nothing
but
*NL*
a
hero
like
many
another
.
Those
Scotch
Grays
,
those
Horse
Guards
,
those
*NL*
regiments
of
Maitland
and
of
Mitchell
,
that
infantry
of
Pack
and
Kempt
,
*NL*
that
cavalry
of
Ponsonby
and
Somerset
,
those
Highlanders
playing
the
*NL*
pibroch
under
the
shower
of
grape-shot
,
those
battalions
of
Rylandt
,
*NL*
those
utterly
raw
recruits
,
who
hardly
knew
how
to
handle
a
musket
*NL*
holding
their
own
against
Essling
's
and
Rivoli
's
old
troops
,
--
that
is
*NL*
what
was
grand
.
Wellington
was
tenacious
;
in
that
lay
his
merit
,
and
we
*NL*
are
not
seeking
to
lessen
it
:
but
the
least
of
his
foot-soldiers
and
of
*NL*
his
cavalry
would
have
been
as
solid
as
he
.
The
iron
soldier
is
worth
*NL*
as
much
as
the
Iron
Duke
.
As
for
us
,
all
our
glorification
goes
to
the
*NL*
English
soldier
,
to
the
English
army
,
to
the
English
people
.
If
trophy
*NL*
there
be
,
it
is
to
England
that
the
trophy
is
due
.
The
column
of
*NL*
Waterloo
would
be
more
just
,
if
,
instead
of
the
figure
of
a
man
,
it
bore
*NL*
on
high
the
statue
of
a
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
great
England
will
be
angry
at
what
we
are
saying
here
.
She
*NL*
still
cherishes
,
after
her
own
1688
and
our
1789
,
the
feudal
illusion
.
*NL*
She
believes
in
heredity
and
hierarchy
.
This
people
,
surpassed
by
none
*NL*
in
power
and
glory
,
regards
itself
as
a
nation
,
and
not
as
a
people
.
And
*NL*
as
a
people
,
it
willingly
subordinates
itself
and
takes
a
lord
for
its
*NL*
head
.
As
a
workman
,
it
allows
itself
to
be
disdained
;
as
a
soldier
,
it
*NL*
allows
itself
to
be
flogged
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
,
that
at
the
battle
of
Inkermann
a
sergeant
who
*NL*
had
,
it
appears
,
saved
the
army
,
could
not
be
mentioned
by
Lord
Paglan
,
*NL*
as
the
English
military
hierarchy
does
not
permit
any
hero
below
the
*NL*
grade
of
an
officer
to
be
mentioned
in
the
reports
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
we
admire
above
all
,
in
an
encounter
of
the
nature
of
*NL*
Waterloo
,
is
the
marvellous
cleverness
of
chance
.
A
nocturnal
rain
,
the
*NL*
wall
of
Hougomont
,
the
hollow
road
of
Ohain
,
Grouchy
deaf
to
the
cannon
,
*NL*
Napoleon
's
guide
deceiving
him
,
Bulow
's
guide
enlightening
him
,
--
the
*NL*
whole
of
this
cataclysm
is
wonderfully
conducted
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
whole
,
let
us
say
it
plainly
,
it
was
more
of
a
massacre
than
of
a
*NL*
battle
at
Waterloo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
all
pitched
battles
,
Waterloo
is
the
one
which
has
the
smallest
front
*NL*
for
such
a
number
of
combatants
.
Napoleon
three-quarters
of
a
league
;
*NL*
Wellington
,
half
a
league
;
seventy-two
thousand
combatants
on
each
side
.
*NL*
From
this
denseness
the
carnage
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
calculation
has
been
made
,
and
the
following
proportion
*NL*
established
:
Loss
of
men
:
at
Austerlitz
,
French
,
fourteen
per
cent
;
*NL*
Russians
,
thirty
per
cent
;
Austrians
,
forty-four
per
cent
.
At
Wagram
,
*NL*
French
,
thirteen
per
cent
;
Austrians
,
fourteen
.
At
the
Moskowa
,
French
,
*NL*
thirty-seven
per
cent
;
Russians
,
forty-four
.
At
Bautzen
,
French
,
*NL*
thirteen
per
cent
;
Russians
and
Prussians
,
fourteen
.
At
Waterloo
,
*NL*
French
,
fifty-six
per
cent
;
the
Allies
,
thirty-one
.
Total
for
Waterloo
,
*NL*
forty-one
per
cent
;
one
hundred
and
forty-four
thousand
combatants
;
*NL*
sixty
thousand
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
the
field
of
Waterloo
has
the
calm
which
belongs
to
the
earth
,
*NL*
the
impassive
support
of
man
,
and
it
resembles
all
plains
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
,
moreover
,
a
sort
of
visionary
mist
arises
from
it
;
and
if
a
*NL*
traveller
strolls
there
,
if
he
listens
,
if
he
watches
,
if
he
dreams
*NL*
like
Virgil
in
the
fatal
plains
of
Philippi
,
the
hallucination
of
the
*NL*
catastrophe
takes
possession
of
him
.
The
frightful
18th
of
June
lives
*NL*
again
;
the
false
monumental
hillock
disappears
,
the
lion
vanishes
in
*NL*
air
,
the
battle-field
resumes
its
reality
,
lines
of
infantry
undulate
*NL*
over
the
plain
,
furious
gallops
traverse
the
horizon
;
the
frightened
*NL*
dreamer
beholds
the
flash
of
sabres
,
the
gleam
of
bayonets
,
the
flare
of
*NL*
bombs
,
the
tremendous
interchange
of
thunders
;
he
hears
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
the
death
rattle
in
the
depths
of
a
tomb
,
the
vague
clamor
of
the
battle
*NL*
phantom
;
those
shadows
are
grenadiers
,
those
lights
are
cuirassiers
;
*NL*
that
skeleton
Napoleon
,
that
other
skeleton
is
Wellington
;
all
this
no
*NL*
longer
exists
,
and
yet
it
clashes
together
and
combats
still
;
and
the
*NL*
ravines
are
empurpled
,
and
the
trees
quiver
,
and
there
is
fury
even
in
*NL*
the
clouds
and
in
the
shadows
;
all
those
terrible
heights
,
Hougomont
,
*NL*
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
Frischemont
,
Papelotte
,
Plancenoit
,
appear
confusedly
*NL*
crowned
with
whirlwinds
of
spectres
engaged
in
exterminating
each
other
.

CHAPTER
XVII
--
IS
WATERLOO
TO
BE
CONSIDERED
GOOD
?
*NL*
*NL*
There
exists
a
very
respectable
liberal
school
which
does
not
hate
*NL*
Waterloo
.
We
do
not
belong
to
it
.
To
us
,
Waterloo
is
but
the
stupefied
*NL*
date
of
liberty
.
That
such
an
eagle
should
emerge
from
such
an
egg
is
*NL*
certainly
unexpected
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
places
one
's
self
at
the
culminating
point
of
view
of
the
*NL*
question
,
Waterloo
is
intentionally
a
counter-revolutionary
victory
.
It
*NL*
is
Europe
against
France
;
it
is
Petersburg
,
Berlin
,
and
Vienna
against
*NL*
Paris
;
it
is
the
statu
quo
against
the
initiative
;
it
is
the
14th
*NL*
of
July
,
1789
,
attacked
through
the
20th
of
March
,
1815
;
it
is
the
*NL*
monarchies
clearing
the
decks
in
opposition
to
the
indomitable
French
*NL*
rioting
.
The
final
extinction
of
that
vast
people
which
had
been
in
*NL*
eruption
for
twenty-six
years
--
such
was
the
dream
.
The
solidarity
of
the
*NL*
Brunswicks
,
the
Nassaus
,
the
Romanoffs
,
the
Hohenzollerns
,
the
Hapsburgs
*NL*
with
the
Bourbons
.
Waterloo
bears
divine
right
on
its
crupper
.
It
is
*NL*
true
,
that
the
Empire
having
been
despotic
,
the
kingdom
by
the
natural
*NL*
reaction
of
things
,
was
forced
to
be
liberal
,
and
that
a
constitutional
*NL*
order
was
the
unwilling
result
of
Waterloo
,
to
the
great
regret
of
the
*NL*
conquerors
.
It
is
because
revolution
can
not
be
really
conquered
,
and
*NL*
that
being
providential
and
absolutely
fatal
,
it
is
always
cropping
*NL*
up
afresh
:
before
Waterloo
,
in
Bonaparte
overthrowing
the
old
thrones
;
*NL*
after
Waterloo
,
in
Louis
XVIII
.
granting
and
conforming
to
the
charter
.
*NL*
Bonaparte
places
a
postilion
on
the
throne
of
Naples
,
and
a
sergeant
*NL*
on
the
throne
of
Sweden
,
employing
inequality
to
demonstrate
equality
;
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
at
Saint-Ouen
countersigns
the
declaration
of
the
rights
*NL*
of
man
.
If
you
wish
to
gain
an
idea
of
what
revolution
is
,
call
it
*NL*
Progress
;
and
if
you
wish
to
acquire
an
idea
of
the
nature
of
progress
,
*NL*
call
it
To-morrow
.
To-morrow
fulfils
its
work
irresistibly
,
and
it
is
*NL*
already
fulfilling
it
to-day
.
It
always
reaches
its
goal
strangely
.
It
*NL*
employs
Wellington
to
make
of
Foy
,
who
was
only
a
soldier
,
an
orator
.
*NL*
Foy
falls
at
Hougomont
and
rises
again
in
the
tribune
.
Thus
does
*NL*
progress
proceed
.
There
is
no
such
thing
as
a
bad
tool
for
that
workman
.
*NL*
It
does
not
become
disconcerted
,
but
adjusts
to
its
divine
work
the
*NL*
man
who
has
bestridden
the
Alps
,
and
the
good
old
tottering
invalid
*NL*
of
Father
Elysee
.
It
makes
use
of
the
gouty
man
as
well
as
of
the
*NL*
conqueror
;
of
the
conqueror
without
,
of
the
gouty
man
within
.
Waterloo
,
*NL*
by
cutting
short
the
demolition
of
European
thrones
by
the
sword
,
had
*NL*
no
other
effect
than
to
cause
the
revolutionary
work
to
be
continued
in
*NL*
another
direction
.
The
slashers
have
finished
;
it
was
the
turn
of
the
*NL*
thinkers
.
The
century
that
Waterloo
was
intended
to
arrest
has
pursued
*NL*
its
march
.
That
sinister
victory
was
vanquished
by
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
and
incontestably
,
that
which
triumphed
at
Waterloo
;
that
*NL*
which
smiled
in
Wellington
's
rear
;
that
which
brought
him
all
the
*NL*
marshals
'
staffs
of
Europe
,
including
,
it
is
said
,
the
staff
of
a
*NL*
marshal
of
France
;
that
which
joyously
trundled
the
barrows
full
of
*NL*
bones
to
erect
the
knoll
of
the
lion
;
that
which
triumphantly
inscribed
*NL*
on
that
pedestal
the
date
``
June
18
,
1815
''
;
that
which
encouraged
*NL*
Blucher
,
as
he
put
the
flying
army
to
the
sword
;
that
which
,
from
the
*NL*
heights
of
the
plateau
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
,
hovered
over
France
as
over
*NL*
its
prey
,
was
the
counter-revolution
.
It
was
the
counter-revolution
*NL*
which
murmured
that
infamous
word
``
dismemberment
.
''
On
arriving
in
Paris
,
*NL*
it
beheld
the
crater
close
at
hand
;
it
felt
those
ashes
which
scorched
*NL*
its
feet
,
and
it
changed
its
mind
;
it
returned
to
the
stammer
of
a
*NL*
charter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
behold
in
Waterloo
only
that
which
is
in
Waterloo
.
Of
intentional
*NL*
liberty
there
is
none
.
The
counter-revolution
was
involuntarily
liberal
,
*NL*
in
the
same
manner
as
,
by
a
corresponding
phenomenon
,
Napoleon
was
*NL*
involuntarily
revolutionary
.
On
the
18th
of
June
,
1815
,
the
mounted
*NL*
Robespierre
was
hurled
from
his
saddle
.

CHAPTER

--
A
RECRUDESCENCE
OF
DIVINE
RIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
End
of
the
dictatorship
.
A
whole
European
system
crumbled
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Empire
sank
into
a
gloom
which
resembled
that
of
the
Roman
world
as
*NL*
it
expired
.
Again
we
behold
the
abyss
,
as
in
the
days
of
the
barbarians
;
*NL*
only
the
barbarism
of
1815
,
which
must
be
called
by
its
pet
name
of
the
*NL*
counter-revolution
,
was
not
long
breathed
,
soon
fell
to
panting
,
and
*NL*
halted
short
.
The
Empire
was
bewept
,
--
let
us
acknowledge
the
fact
,
--
and
*NL*
bewept
by
heroic
eyes
.
If
glory
lies
in
the
sword
converted
into
a
*NL*
sceptre
,
the
Empire
had
been
glory
in
person
.
It
had
diffused
over
the
*NL*
earth
all
the
light
which
tyranny
can
give
a
sombre
light
.
We
will
say
*NL*
more
;
an
obscure
light
.
Compared
to
the
true
daylight
,
it
is
night
.
This
*NL*
disappearance
of
night
produces
the
effect
of
an
eclipse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
re-entered
Paris
.
The
circling
dances
of
the
8th
of
July
*NL*
effaced
the
enthusiasms
of
the
20th
of
March
.
The
Corsican
became
the
*NL*
antithesis
of
the
Bearnese
.
The
flag
on
the
dome
of
the
Tuileries
was
*NL*
white
.
The
exile
reigned
.
Hartwell
's
pine
table
took
its
place
in
front
*NL*
of
the
fleur-de-lys-strewn
throne
of
Louis
XIV
.
Bouvines
and
Fontenoy
*NL*
were
mentioned
as
though
they
had
taken
place
on
the
preceding
*NL*
day
,
Austerlitz
having
become
antiquated
.
The
altar
and
the
throne
*NL*
fraternized
majestically
.
One
of
the
most
undisputed
forms
of
the
health
*NL*
of
society
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
established
over
France
,
and
*NL*
over
the
continent
.
Europe
adopted
the
white
cockade
.
Trestaillon
was
*NL*
celebrated
.
The
device
non
pluribus
impar
re-appeared
on
the
stone
rays
*NL*
representing
a
sun
upon
the
front
of
the
barracks
on
the
Quai
d'Orsay
.
*NL*
Where
there
had
been
an
Imperial
Guard
,
there
was
now
a
red
house
.
The
*NL*
Arc
du
Carrousel
,
all
laden
with
badly
borne
victories
,
thrown
out
*NL*
of
its
element
among
these
novelties
,
a
little
ashamed
,
it
may
be
,
of
*NL*
Marengo
and
Arcola
,
extricated
itself
from
its
predicament
with
the
*NL*
statue
of
the
Duc
d'Angouleme
.
The
cemetery
of
the
Madeleine
,
a
terrible
*NL*
pauper
's
grave
in
1793
,
was
covered
with
jasper
and
marble
,
since
the
*NL*
bones
of
Louis
XVI
.
and
Marie
Antoinette
lay
in
that
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
moat
of
Vincennes
a
sepulchral
shaft
sprang
from
the
earth
,
*NL*
recalling
the
fact
that
the
Duc
d'Enghien
had
perished
in
the
very
*NL*
month
when
Napoleon
was
crowned
.
Pope
Pius
VII.
,
who
had
performed
the
*NL*
coronation
very
near
this
death
,
tranquilly
bestowed
his
blessing
on
the
*NL*
fall
as
he
had
bestowed
it
on
the
elevation
.
At
Schoenbrunn
there
was
*NL*
a
little
shadow
,
aged
four
,
whom
it
was
seditious
to
call
the
King
of
*NL*
Rome
.
And
these
things
took
place
,
and
the
kings
resumed
their
thrones
,
*NL*
and
the
master
of
Europe
was
put
in
a
cage
,
and
the
old
regime
became
*NL*
the
new
regime
,
and
all
the
shadows
and
all
the
light
of
the
earth
*NL*
changed
place
,
because
,
on
the
afternoon
of
a
certain
summer
's
day
,
a
*NL*
shepherd
said
to
a
Prussian
in
the
forest
,
``
Go
this
way
,
and
not
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
1815
was
a
sort
of
lugubrious
April
.
Ancient
unhealthy
and
*NL*
poisonous
realities
were
covered
with
new
appearances
.
A
lie
wedded
*NL*
1789
;
the
right
divine
was
masked
under
a
charter
;
fictions
became
*NL*
constitutional
;
prejudices
,
superstitions
and
mental
reservations
,
with
*NL*
Article
14
in
the
heart
,
were
varnished
over
with
liberalism
.
It
was
the
*NL*
serpent
's
change
of
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
had
been
rendered
both
greater
and
smaller
by
Napoleon
.
Under
this
*NL*
reign
of
splendid
matter
,
the
ideal
had
received
the
strange
name
of
*NL*
ideology
!
It
is
a
grave
imprudence
in
a
great
man
to
turn
the
future
*NL*
into
derision
.
The
populace
,
however
,
that
food
for
cannon
which
is
so
*NL*
fond
of
the
cannoneer
,
sought
him
with
its
glance
.
Where
is
he
?
What
is
*NL*
he
doing
?
``
Napoleon
is
dead
,
''
said
a
passer-by
to
a
veteran
of
Marengo
*NL*
and
Waterloo
.
``
He
dead
!
''
cried
the
soldier
;
``
you
do
n't
know
him
.
''
*NL*
Imagination
distrusted
this
man
,
even
when
overthrown
.
The
depths
of
*NL*
Europe
were
full
of
darkness
after
Waterloo
.
Something
enormous
remained
*NL*
long
empty
through
Napoleon
's
disappearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kings
placed
themselves
in
this
void
.
Ancient
Europe
profited
by
*NL*
it
to
undertake
reforms
.
There
was
a
Holy
Alliance
;
Belle-Alliance
,
*NL*
Beautiful
Alliance
,
the
fatal
field
of
Waterloo
had
said
in
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
presence
and
in
face
of
that
antique
Europe
reconstructed
,
the
*NL*
features
of
a
new
France
were
sketched
out
.
The
future
,
which
the
*NL*
Emperor
had
rallied
,
made
its
entry
.
On
its
brow
it
bore
the
star
,
*NL*
Liberty
.
The
glowing
eyes
of
all
young
generations
were
turned
on
it
.
*NL*
Singular
fact
!
people
were
,
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
in
love
with
*NL*
the
future
,
Liberty
,
and
the
past
,
Napoleon
.
Defeat
had
rendered
the
*NL*
vanquished
greater
.
Bonaparte
fallen
seemed
more
lofty
than
Napoleon
*NL*
erect
.
Those
who
had
triumphed
were
alarmed
.
England
had
him
guarded
by
*NL*
Hudson
Lowe
,
and
France
had
him
watched
by
Montchenu
.
His
folded
arms
*NL*
became
a
source
of
uneasiness
to
thrones
.
Alexander
called
him
``
my
*NL*
sleeplessness
.
''
This
terror
was
the
result
of
the
quantity
of
*NL*
revolution
which
was
contained
in
him
.
That
is
what
explains
and
excuses
*NL*
Bonapartist
liberalism
.
This
phantom
caused
the
old
world
to
tremble
.
*NL*
The
kings
reigned
,
but
ill
at
their
ease
,
with
the
rock
of
Saint
Helena
*NL*
on
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Napoleon
was
passing
through
the
death
struggle
at
Longwood
,
the
*NL*
sixty
thousand
men
who
had
fallen
on
the
field
of
Waterloo
were
quietly
*NL*
rotting
,
and
something
of
their
peace
was
shed
abroad
over
the
world
.
*NL*
The
Congress
of
Vienna
made
the
treaties
in
1815
,
and
Europe
called
this
*NL*
the
Restoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
Waterloo
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
matters
it
to
the
Infinite
?
all
that
tempest
,
all
that
cloud
,
*NL*
that
war
,
then
that
peace
?
All
that
darkness
did
not
trouble
for
a
*NL*
moment
the
light
of
that
immense
Eye
before
which
a
grub
skipping
from
*NL*
one
blade
of
grass
to
another
equals
the
eagle
soaring
from
belfry
to
*NL*
belfry
on
the
towers
of
Notre
Dame
.

CHAPTER
XIX
--
THE
BATTLE-FIELD
AT
NIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
--
it
is
a
necessity
in
this
book
--
to
that
fatal
*NL*
battle-field
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
18th
of
June
the
moon
was
full
.
Its
light
favored
Blucher
's
*NL*
ferocious
pursuit
,
betrayed
the
traces
of
the
fugitives
,
delivered
*NL*
up
that
disastrous
mass
to
the
eager
Prussian
cavalry
,
and
aided
the
*NL*
massacre
.
Such
tragic
favors
of
the
night
do
occur
sometimes
during
*NL*
catastrophes
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
last
cannon-shot
had
been
fired
,
the
plain
of
Mont-Saint-Jean
*NL*
remained
deserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
English
occupied
the
encampment
of
the
French
;
it
is
the
usual
sign
*NL*
of
victory
to
sleep
in
the
bed
of
the
vanquished
.
They
established
their
*NL*
bivouac
beyond
Rossomme
.
The
Prussians
,
let
loose
on
the
retreating
*NL*
rout
,
pushed
forward
.
Wellington
went
to
the
village
of
Waterloo
to
draw
*NL*
up
his
report
to
Lord
Bathurst
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
ever
the
sic
vos
non
vobis
was
applicable
,
it
certainly
is
to
that
*NL*
village
of
Waterloo
.
Waterloo
took
no
part
,
and
lay
half
a
league
from
*NL*
the
scene
of
action
.
Mont-Saint-Jean
was
cannonaded
,
Hougomont
was
*NL*
burned
,
La
Haie-Sainte
was
taken
by
assault
,
Papelotte
was
burned
,
*NL*
Plancenoit
was
burned
,
La
Belle-Alliance
beheld
the
embrace
of
the
two
*NL*
conquerors
;
these
names
are
hardly
known
,
and
Waterloo
,
which
worked
not
*NL*
in
the
battle
,
bears
off
all
the
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
not
of
the
number
of
those
who
flatter
war
;
when
the
occasion
*NL*
presents
itself
,
we
tell
the
truth
about
it
.
War
has
frightful
beauties
*NL*
which
we
have
not
concealed
;
it
has
also
,
we
acknowledge
,
some
hideous
*NL*
features
.
One
of
the
most
surprising
is
the
prompt
stripping
of
the
*NL*
bodies
of
the
dead
after
the
victory
.
The
dawn
which
follows
a
battle
*NL*
always
rises
on
naked
corpses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
does
this
?
Who
thus
soils
the
triumph
?
What
hideous
,
furtive
hand
is
*NL*
that
which
is
slipped
into
the
pocket
of
victory
?
What
pickpockets
*NL*
are
they
who
ply
their
trade
in
the
rear
of
glory
?
Some
*NL*
philosophers
--
Voltaire
among
the
number
--
affirm
that
it
is
precisely
*NL*
those
persons
have
made
the
glory
.
It
is
the
same
men
,
they
say
;
there
*NL*
is
no
relief
corps
;
those
who
are
erect
pillage
those
who
are
prone
*NL*
on
the
earth
.
The
hero
of
the
day
is
the
vampire
of
the
night
.
One
has
*NL*
assuredly
the
right
,
after
all
,
to
strip
a
corpse
a
bit
when
one
is
the
*NL*
author
of
that
corpse
.
For
our
own
part
,
we
do
not
think
so
;
it
seems
*NL*
to
us
impossible
that
the
same
hand
should
pluck
laurels
and
purloin
the
*NL*
shoes
from
a
dead
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
is
certain
,
which
is
,
that
generally
after
conquerors
follow
*NL*
thieves
.
But
let
us
leave
the
soldier
,
especially
the
contemporary
*NL*
soldier
,
out
of
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
army
has
a
rear-guard
,
and
it
is
that
which
must
be
blamed
.
*NL*
Bat-like
creatures
,
half
brigands
and
lackeys
;
all
the
sorts
of
*NL*
vespertillos
that
that
twilight
called
war
engenders
;
wearers
of
*NL*
uniforms
,
who
take
no
part
in
the
fighting
;
pretended
invalids
;
*NL*
formidable
limpers
;
interloping
sutlers
,
trotting
along
in
little
carts
,
*NL*
sometimes
accompanied
by
their
wives
,
and
stealing
things
which
they
*NL*
sell
again
;
beggars
offering
themselves
as
guides
to
officers
;
soldiers
'
*NL*
servants
;
marauders
;
armies
on
the
march
in
days
gone
by
,
--
we
are
not
*NL*
speaking
of
the
present
,
--
dragged
all
this
behind
them
,
so
that
in
the
*NL*
special
language
they
are
called
``
stragglers
.
''
No
army
,
no
nation
,
*NL*
was
responsible
for
those
beings
;
they
spoke
Italian
and
followed
the
*NL*
Germans
,
then
spoke
French
and
followed
the
English
.
It
was
by
one
of
*NL*
these
wretches
,
a
Spanish
straggler
who
spoke
French
,
that
the
Marquis
*NL*
of
Fervacques
,
deceived
by
his
Picard
jargon
,
and
taking
him
for
one
*NL*
of
our
own
men
,
was
traitorously
slain
and
robbed
on
the
battle-field
*NL*
itself
,
in
the
course
of
the
night
which
followed
the
victory
of
*NL*
Cerisoles
.
The
rascal
sprang
from
this
marauding
.
The
detestable
maxim
,
*NL*
Live
on
the
enemy
!
produced
this
leprosy
,
which
a
strict
discipline
*NL*
alone
could
heal
.
There
are
reputations
which
are
deceptive
;
one
does
*NL*
not
always
know
why
certain
generals
,
great
in
other
directions
,
have
*NL*
been
so
popular
.
Turenne
was
adored
by
his
soldiers
because
he
tolerated
*NL*
pillage
;
evil
permitted
constitutes
part
of
goodness
.
Turenne
was
so
*NL*
good
that
he
allowed
the
Palatinate
to
be
delivered
over
to
fire
and
*NL*
blood
.
The
marauders
in
the
train
of
an
army
were
more
or
less
in
*NL*
number
,
according
as
the
chief
was
more
or
less
severe
.
Hoche
and
*NL*
Marceau
had
no
stragglers
;
Wellington
had
few
,
and
we
do
him
the
justice
*NL*
to
mention
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
on
the
night
from
the
18th
to
the
19th
of
June
,
the
dead
*NL*
were
robbed
.
Wellington
was
rigid
;
he
gave
orders
that
any
one
caught
in
*NL*
the
act
should
be
shot
;
but
rapine
is
tenacious
.
The
marauders
stole
in
*NL*
one
corner
of
the
battlefield
while
others
were
being
shot
in
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
sinister
over
this
plain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
midnight
,
a
man
was
prowling
about
,
or
rather
,
climbing
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
hollow
road
of
Ohain
.
To
all
appearance
he
was
one
of
*NL*
those
whom
we
have
just
described
,
--
neither
English
nor
French
,
neither
*NL*
peasant
nor
soldier
,
less
a
man
than
a
ghoul
attracted
by
the
scent
*NL*
of
the
dead
bodies
having
theft
for
his
victory
,
and
come
to
rifle
*NL*
Waterloo
.
He
was
clad
in
a
blouse
that
was
something
like
a
great
coat
;
*NL*
he
was
uneasy
and
audacious
;
he
walked
forwards
and
gazed
behind
him
.
*NL*
Who
was
this
man
?
The
night
probably
knew
more
of
him
than
the
day
.
He
*NL*
had
no
sack
,
but
evidently
he
had
large
pockets
under
his
coat
.
From
*NL*
time
to
time
he
halted
,
scrutinized
the
plain
around
him
as
though
to
*NL*
see
whether
he
were
observed
,
bent
over
abruptly
,
disturbed
something
*NL*
silent
and
motionless
on
the
ground
,
then
rose
and
fled
.
His
sliding
*NL*
motion
,
his
attitudes
,
his
mysterious
and
rapid
gestures
,
caused
him
*NL*
to
resemble
those
twilight
larvae
which
haunt
ruins
,
and
which
ancient
*NL*
Norman
legends
call
the
Alleurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
nocturnal
wading
birds
produce
these
silhouettes
among
the
*NL*
marshes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glance
capable
of
piercing
all
that
mist
deeply
would
have
perceived
*NL*
at
some
distance
a
sort
of
little
sutler
's
wagon
with
a
fluted
wicker
*NL*
hood
,
harnessed
to
a
famished
nag
which
was
cropping
the
grass
across
*NL*
its
bit
as
it
halted
,
hidden
,
as
it
were
,
behind
the
hovel
which
adjoins
*NL*
the
highway
to
Nivelles
,
at
the
angle
of
the
road
from
Mont-Saint-Jean
*NL*
to
Braine
l'Alleud
;
and
in
the
wagon
,
a
sort
of
woman
seated
on
coffers
*NL*
and
packages
.
Perhaps
there
was
some
connection
between
that
wagon
and
*NL*
that
prowler
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
was
serene
.
Not
a
cloud
in
the
zenith
.
What
matters
it
if
*NL*
the
earth
be
red
!
the
moon
remains
white
;
these
are
the
indifferences
of
*NL*
the
sky
.
In
the
fields
,
branches
of
trees
broken
by
grape-shot
,
but
not
*NL*
fallen
,
upheld
by
their
bark
,
swayed
gently
in
the
breeze
of
night
.
*NL*
A
breath
,
almost
a
respiration
,
moved
the
shrubbery
.
Quivers
which
*NL*
resembled
the
departure
of
souls
ran
through
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
distance
the
coming
and
going
of
patrols
and
the
general
rounds
*NL*
of
the
English
camp
were
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hougomont
and
La
Haie-Sainte
continued
to
burn
,
forming
,
one
in
the
*NL*
west
,
the
other
in
the
east
,
two
great
flames
which
were
joined
by
the
*NL*
cordon
of
bivouac
fires
of
the
English
,
like
a
necklace
of
rubies
*NL*
with
two
carbuncles
at
the
extremities
,
as
they
extended
in
an
immense
*NL*
semicircle
over
the
hills
along
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
described
the
catastrophe
of
the
road
of
Ohain
.
The
heart
is
*NL*
terrified
at
the
thought
of
what
that
death
must
have
been
to
so
many
*NL*
brave
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
is
anything
terrible
,
if
there
exists
a
reality
which
surpasses
*NL*
dreams
,
it
is
this
:
to
live
,
to
see
the
sun
;
to
be
in
full
possession
*NL*
of
virile
force
;
to
possess
health
and
joy
;
to
laugh
valiantly
;
to
rush
*NL*
towards
a
glory
which
one
sees
dazzling
in
front
of
one
;
to
feel
in
*NL*
one
's
breast
lungs
which
breathe
,
a
heart
which
beats
,
a
will
which
*NL*
reasons
;
to
speak
,
think
,
hope
,
love
;
to
have
a
mother
,
to
have
a
wife
,
*NL*
to
have
children
;
to
have
the
light
--
and
all
at
once
,
in
the
space
of
a
*NL*
shout
,
in
less
than
a
minute
,
to
sink
into
an
abyss
;
to
fall
,
to
*NL*
roll
,
to
crush
,
to
be
crushed
;
to
see
ears
of
wheat
,
flowers
,
leaves
,
*NL*
branches
;
not
to
be
able
to
catch
hold
of
anything
;
to
feel
one
's
sword
*NL*
useless
,
men
beneath
one
,
horses
on
top
of
one
;
to
struggle
in
vain
,
*NL*
since
one
's
bones
have
been
broken
by
some
kick
in
the
darkness
;
to
feel
*NL*
a
heel
which
makes
one
's
eyes
start
from
their
sockets
;
to
bite
horses
'
*NL*
shoes
in
one
's
rage
;
to
stifle
,
to
yell
,
to
writhe
;
to
be
beneath
,
and
*NL*
to
say
to
one
's
self
,
``
But
just
a
little
while
ago
I
was
a
living
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
where
that
lamentable
disaster
had
uttered
its
death-rattle
,
*NL*
all
was
silence
now
.
The
edges
of
the
hollow
road
were
encumbered
with
*NL*
horses
and
riders
,
inextricably
heaped
up
.
Terrible
entanglement
!
There
*NL*
was
no
longer
any
slope
,
for
the
corpses
had
levelled
the
road
with
the
*NL*
plain
,
and
reached
the
brim
like
a
well-filled
bushel
of
barley
.
A
*NL*
heap
of
dead
bodies
in
the
upper
part
,
a
river
of
blood
in
the
lower
*NL*
part
--
such
was
that
road
on
the
evening
of
the
18th
of
June
,
1815
.
The
*NL*
blood
ran
even
to
the
Nivelles
highway
,
and
there
overflowed
in
a
large
*NL*
pool
in
front
of
the
abatis
of
trees
which
barred
the
way
,
at
a
spot
*NL*
which
is
still
pointed
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
that
it
was
at
the
opposite
point
,
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
Genappe
road
,
that
the
destruction
of
the
cuirassiers
*NL*
had
taken
place
.
The
thickness
of
the
layer
of
bodies
was
proportioned
*NL*
to
the
depth
of
the
hollow
road
.
Towards
the
middle
,
at
the
point
*NL*
where
it
became
level
,
where
Delort
's
division
had
passed
,
the
layer
of
*NL*
corpses
was
thinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nocturnal
prowler
whom
we
have
just
shown
to
the
reader
was
going
*NL*
in
that
direction
.
He
was
searching
that
vast
tomb
.
He
gazed
about
.
He
*NL*
passed
the
dead
in
some
sort
of
hideous
review
.
He
walked
with
his
feet
*NL*
in
the
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
paces
in
front
of
him
,
in
the
hollow
road
,
at
the
point
where
*NL*
the
pile
of
dead
came
to
an
end
,
an
open
hand
,
illumined
by
the
moon
,
*NL*
projected
from
beneath
that
heap
of
men
.
That
hand
had
on
its
finger
*NL*
something
sparkling
,
which
was
a
ring
of
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
bent
over
,
remained
in
a
crouching
attitude
for
a
moment
,
and
*NL*
when
he
rose
there
was
no
longer
a
ring
on
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
precisely
rise
;
he
remained
in
a
stooping
and
frightened
*NL*
attitude
,
with
his
back
turned
to
the
heap
of
dead
,
scanning
the
horizon
*NL*
on
his
knees
,
with
the
whole
upper
portion
of
his
body
supported
on
his
*NL*
two
forefingers
,
which
rested
on
the
earth
,
and
his
head
peering
above
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
hollow
road
.
The
jackal
's
four
paws
suit
some
actions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
coming
to
a
decision
,
he
rose
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
gave
a
terrible
start
.
He
felt
some
one
clutch
him
*NL*
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wheeled
round
;
it
was
the
open
hand
,
which
had
closed
,
and
had
seized
*NL*
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
honest
man
would
have
been
terrified
;
this
man
burst
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
's
only
a
dead
body
.
I
prefer
a
spook
to
a
*NL*
gendarme
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
hand
weakened
and
released
him
.
Effort
is
quickly
exhausted
in
*NL*
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
now
,
''
said
the
prowler
,
``
is
that
dead
fellow
alive
?
Let
's
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
down
again
,
fumbled
among
the
heap
,
pushed
aside
everything
that
*NL*
was
in
his
way
,
seized
the
hand
,
grasped
the
arm
,
freed
the
head
,
pulled
*NL*
out
the
body
,
and
a
few
moments
later
he
was
dragging
the
lifeless
,
or
*NL*
at
least
the
unconscious
,
man
,
through
the
shadows
of
hollow
road
.
He
*NL*
was
a
cuirassier
,
an
officer
,
and
even
an
officer
of
considerable
rank
;
*NL*
a
large
gold
epaulette
peeped
from
beneath
the
cuirass
;
this
officer
*NL*
no
longer
possessed
a
helmet
.
A
furious
sword-cut
had
scarred
his
face
,
*NL*
where
nothing
was
discernible
but
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
did
not
appear
to
have
any
broken
limbs
,
and
,
by
some
happy
*NL*
chance
,
if
that
word
is
permissible
here
,
the
dead
had
been
vaulted
*NL*
above
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
preserve
him
from
being
crushed
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
still
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
cuirass
he
wore
the
silver
cross
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prowler
tore
off
this
cross
,
which
disappeared
into
one
of
the
gulfs
*NL*
which
he
had
beneath
his
great
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
felt
of
the
officer
's
fob
,
discovered
a
watch
there
,
and
took
*NL*
possession
of
it
.
Next
he
searched
his
waistcoat
,
found
a
purse
and
*NL*
pocketed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
arrived
at
this
stage
of
succor
which
he
was
administering
*NL*
to
this
dying
man
,
the
officer
opened
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
''
he
said
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
abruptness
of
the
movements
of
the
man
who
was
manipulating
him
,
the
*NL*
freshness
of
the
night
,
the
air
which
he
could
inhale
freely
,
had
roused
*NL*
him
from
his
lethargy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prowler
made
no
reply
.
He
raised
his
head
.
A
sound
of
footsteps
was
*NL*
audible
in
the
plain
;
some
patrol
was
probably
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
murmured
,
for
the
death
agony
was
still
in
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
won
the
battle
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
English
,
''
answered
the
prowler
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
in
my
pockets
;
you
will
find
a
watch
and
a
purse
.
Take
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
already
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prowler
executed
the
required
feint
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
robbed
,
''
said
the
officer
;
``
I
am
sorry
for
that
.
You
should
*NL*
have
had
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
steps
of
the
patrol
became
more
and
more
distinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
one
is
coming
,
''
said
the
prowler
,
with
the
movement
of
a
man
who
*NL*
is
taking
his
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
raised
his
arm
feebly
,
and
detained
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
saved
my
life
.
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prowler
answered
rapidly
,
and
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
yourself
,
I
belonged
to
the
French
army
.
I
must
leave
you
.
If
they
*NL*
were
to
catch
me
,
they
would
shoot
me
.
I
have
saved
your
life
.
Now
get
*NL*
out
of
the
scrape
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
rank
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sergeant

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
forget
that
name
,
''
said
the
officer
;
``
and
do
you
remember
*NL*
mine
.
My
name
is
Pontmercy

Jean
Valjean
had

*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
be
grateful
to
us
if
we
pass
rapidly
over
the
sad
*NL*
details
.
We
will
confine
ourselves
to
transcribing
two
paragraphs
*NL*
published
by
the
journals
of
that
day
,
a
few
months
after
the
surprising
*NL*
events
which
had
taken
place
at
M.
sur
M
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
articles
are
rather
summary
.
It
must
be
remembered
,
that
at
that
*NL*
epoch
the
Gazette
des
Tribunaux
was
not
yet
in
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
borrow
the
first
from
the
Drapeau
Blanc
.
It
bears
the
date
of
July
*NL*
25
,
1823
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
An
arrondissement
of
the
Pas
de
Calais
has
just
been
the
theatre
of
an
*NL*
event
quite
out
of
the
ordinary
course
.
A
man
,
who
was
a
stranger
in
the
*NL*
Department
,
and
who
bore
the
name
of
M.
Madeleine
,
had
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
new
methods
,
resuscitated
some
years
ago
an
ancient
local
industry
,
the
*NL*
manufacture
of
jet
and
of
black
glass
trinkets
.
He
had
made
his
fortune
*NL*
in
the
business
,
and
that
of
the
arrondissement
as
well
,
we
will
admit
.
*NL*
He
had
been
appointed
mayor
,
in
recognition
of
his
services
.
The
police
*NL*
discovered
that
M.
Madeleine
was
no
other
than
an
ex-convict
who
had
*NL*
broken
his
ban
,
condemned
in
1796
for
theft
,
and
named
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
has
been
recommitted
to
prison
.
It
appears
that
previous
*NL*
to
his
arrest
he
had
succeeded
in
withdrawing
from
the
hands
of
M.
*NL*
Laffitte
,
a
sum
of
over
half
a
million
which
he
had
lodged
there
,
and
*NL*
which
he
had
,
moreover
,
and
by
perfectly
legitimate
means
,
acquired
in
*NL*
his
business
.
No
one
has
been
able
to
discover
where
Jean
Valjean
has
*NL*
concealed
this
money
since
his
return
to
prison
at
Toulon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
article
,
which
enters
a
little
more
into
detail
,
is
an
*NL*
extract
from
the
Journal
de
Paris
,
of
the
same
date
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
former
convict
,
who
had
been
liberated
,
named
Jean
Valjean
,
has
just
*NL*
appeared
before
the
Court
of
Assizes
of
the
Var
,
under
circumstances
*NL*
calculated
to
attract
attention
.
This
wretch
had
succeeded
in
escaping
*NL*
the
vigilance
of
the
police
,
he
had
changed
his
name
,
and
had
succeeded
*NL*
in
getting
himself
appointed
mayor
of
one
of
our
small
northern
towns
;
*NL*
in
this
town
he
had
established
a
considerable
commerce
.
He
has
at
last
*NL*
been
unmasked
and
arrested
,
thanks
to
the
indefatigable
zeal
of
the
*NL*
public
prosecutor
.
He
had
for
his
concubine
a
woman
of
the
town
,
who
*NL*
died
of
a
shock
at
the
moment
of
his
arrest
.
This
scoundrel
,
who
is
*NL*
endowed
with
Herculean
strength
,
found
means
to
escape
;
but
three
or
*NL*
four
days
after
his
flight
the
police
laid
their
hands
on
him
once
more
,
*NL*
in
Paris
itself
,
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
entering
one
of
those
*NL*
little
vehicles
which
run
between
the
capital
and
the
village
of
*NL*
Montfermeil
-LRB-
Seine-et-Oise
-RRB-
.
He
is
said
to
have
profited
by
this
*NL*
interval
of
three
or
four
days
of
liberty
,
to
withdraw
a
considerable
*NL*
sum
deposited
by
him
with
one
of
our
leading
bankers
.
This
sum
has
been
*NL*
estimated
at
six
or
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
.
If
the
indictment
is
*NL*
to
be
trusted
,
he
has
hidden
it
in
some
place
known
to
himself
alone
,
*NL*
and
it
has
not
been
possible
to
lay
hands
on
it
.
However
that
may
be
,
*NL*
the
said
Jean
Valjean
has
just
been
brought
before
the
Assizes
of
the
*NL*
Department
of
the
Var
as
accused
of
highway
robbery
accompanied
with
*NL*
violence
,
about
eight
years
ago
,
on
the
person
of
one
of
those
honest
*NL*
children
who
,
as
the
patriarch
of
Ferney
has
said
,
in
immortal
verse
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
Arrive
from
Savoy
every
year
,
*NL*
And
who
,
with
gentle
hands
,
do
clear
*NL*
Those
long
canals
choked
up
with
soot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
bandit
refused
to
defend
himself
.
It
was
proved
by
the
skilful
and
*NL*
eloquent
representative
of
the
public
prosecutor
,
that
the
theft
was
*NL*
committed
in
complicity
with
others
,
and
that
Jean
Valjean
was
a
member
*NL*
of
a
band
of
robbers
in
the
south
.
Jean
Valjean
was
pronounced
guilty
*NL*
and
was
condemned
to
the
death
penalty
in
consequence
.
This
criminal
*NL*
refused
to
lodge
an
appeal
.
The
king
,
in
his
inexhaustible
clemency
,
has
*NL*
deigned
to
commute
his
penalty
to
that
of
penal
servitude
for
life
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
immediately
taken
to
the
prison
at
Toulon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
not
forgotten
that
Jean
Valjean
had
religious
habits
at
*NL*
M.
sur
M
.
Some
papers
,
among
others
the
Constitutional
,
presented
this
*NL*
commutation
as
a
triumph
of
the
priestly
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
changed
his
number
in
the
galleys
.
He
was
called
9,430
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
and
we
will
mention
it
at
once
in
order
that
we
may
not
be
*NL*
obliged
to
recur
to
the
subject
,
the
prosperity
of
M.
sur
M.
vanished
*NL*
with
M.
Madeleine
;
all
that
he
had
foreseen
during
his
night
of
fever
*NL*
and
hesitation
was
realized
;
lacking
him
,
there
actually
was
a
soul
*NL*
lacking
.
After
this
fall
,
there
took
place
at
M.
sur
M.
that
egotistical
*NL*
division
of
great
existences
which
have
fallen
,
that
fatal
dismemberment
*NL*
of
flourishing
things
which
is
accomplished
every
day
,
obscurely
,
in
*NL*
the
human
community
,
and
which
history
has
noted
only
once
,
because
it
*NL*
occurred
after
the
death
of
Alexander
.
Lieutenants
are
crowned
kings
;
*NL*
superintendents
improvise
manufacturers
out
of
themselves
.
Envious
*NL*
rivalries
arose
.
M.
Madeleine
's
vast
workshops
were
shut
;
his
buildings
*NL*
fell
to
ruin
,
his
workmen
were
scattered
.
Some
of
them
quitted
the
*NL*
country
,
others
abandoned
the
trade
.
Thenceforth
,
everything
was
done
*NL*
on
a
small
scale
,
instead
of
on
a
grand
scale
;
for
lucre
instead
of
*NL*
the
general
good
.
There
was
no
longer
a
centre
;
everywhere
there
*NL*
was
competition
and
animosity
.
M.
Madeleine
had
reigned
over
all
and
*NL*
directed
all
.
No
sooner
had
he
fallen
,
than
each
pulled
things
to
*NL*
himself
;
the
spirit
of
combat
succeeded
to
the
spirit
of
organization
,
*NL*
bitterness
to
cordiality
,
hatred
of
one
another
to
the
benevolence
of
*NL*
the
founder
towards
all
;
the
threads
which
M.
Madeleine
had
set
were
*NL*
tangled
and
broken
,
the
methods
were
adulterated
,
the
products
were
*NL*
debased
,
confidence
was
killed
;
the
market
diminished
,
for
lack
of
*NL*
orders
;
salaries
were
reduced
,
the
workshops
stood
still
,
bankruptcy
*NL*
arrived
.
And
then
there
was
nothing
more
for
the
poor
.
All
had
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
state
itself
perceived
that
some
one
had
been
crushed
somewhere
.
*NL*
Less
than
four
years
after
the
judgment
of
the
Court
of
Assizes
*NL*
establishing
the
identity
of
Jean
Valjean
and
M.
Madeleine
,
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
the
galleys
,
the
cost
of
collecting
taxes
had
doubled
in
the
*NL*
arrondissement
of
M.
sur
M.
;
and
M.
de
Villele
called
attention
to
the
*NL*
fact
in
the
rostrum
,
in
the
month
of
February
,
1827

CHAPTER
II
--
IN
WHICH
THE
READER
WILL
PERUSE
TWO
VERSES
,
WHICH
ARE
OF
THE
*NL*
DEVIL
'S
COMPOSITION
,
POSSIBLY
*NL*
*NL*
Before
proceeding
further
,
it
will
be
to
the
purpose
to
narrate
in
some
*NL*
detail
,
a
singular
occurrence
which
took
place
at
about
the
same
epoch
,
*NL*
in
Montfermeil
,
and
which
is
not
lacking
in
coincidence
with
certain
*NL*
conjectures
of
the
indictment
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
exists
in
the
region
of
Montfermeil
a
very
ancient
superstition
,
*NL*
which
is
all
the
more
curious
and
all
the
more
precious
,
because
*NL*
a
popular
superstition
in
the
vicinity
of
Paris
is
like
an
aloe
in
*NL*
Siberia
.
We
are
among
those
who
respect
everything
which
is
in
the
*NL*
nature
of
a
rare
plant
.
Here
,
then
,
is
the
superstition
of
Montfermeil
:
*NL*
it
is
thought
that
the
devil
,
from
time
immemorial
,
has
selected
the
*NL*
forest
as
a
hiding-place
for
his
treasures
.
Goodwives
affirm
that
it
is
*NL*
no
rarity
to
encounter
at
nightfall
,
in
secluded
nooks
of
the
forest
,
*NL*
a
black
man
with
the
air
of
a
carter
or
a
wood-chopper
,
wearing
wooden
*NL*
shoes
,
clad
in
trousers
and
a
blouse
of
linen
,
and
recognizable
by
the
*NL*
fact
,
that
,
instead
of
a
cap
or
hat
,
he
has
two
immense
horns
on
his
*NL*
head
.
This
ought
,
in
fact
,
to
render
him
recognizable
.
This
man
is
*NL*
habitually
engaged
in
digging
a
hole
.
There
are
three
ways
of
profiting
*NL*
by
such
an
encounter
.
The
first
is
to
approach
the
man
and
speak
to
him
.
*NL*
Then
it
is
seen
that
the
man
is
simply
a
peasant
,
that
he
appears
black
*NL*
because
it
is
nightfall
;
that
he
is
not
digging
any
hole
whatever
,
but
*NL*
is
cutting
grass
for
his
cows
,
and
that
what
had
been
taken
for
horns
*NL*
is
nothing
but
a
dung-fork
which
he
is
carrying
on
his
back
,
and
whose
*NL*
teeth
,
thanks
to
the
perspective
of
evening
,
seemed
to
spring
from
his
*NL*
head
.
The
man
returns
home
and
dies
within
the
week
.
The
second
way
is
*NL*
to
watch
him
,
to
wait
until
he
has
dug
his
hole
,
until
he
has
filled
it
*NL*
and
has
gone
away
;
then
to
run
with
great
speed
to
the
trench
,
to
*NL*
open
it
once
more
and
to
seize
the
``
treasure
''
which
the
black
man
*NL*
has
necessarily
placed
there
.
In
this
case
one
dies
within
the
month
.
*NL*
Finally
,
the
last
method
is
not
to
speak
to
the
black
man
,
not
to
look
*NL*
at
him
,
and
to
flee
at
the
best
speed
of
one
's
legs
.
One
then
dies
*NL*
within
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
all
three
methods
are
attended
with
their
special
inconveniences
,
the
*NL*
second
,
which
at
all
events
,
presents
some
advantages
,
among
others
that
*NL*
of
possessing
a
treasure
,
if
only
for
a
month
,
is
the
one
most
generally
*NL*
adopted
.
So
bold
men
,
who
are
tempted
by
every
chance
,
have
quite
*NL*
frequently
,
as
we
are
assured
,
opened
the
holes
excavated
by
the
black
*NL*
man
,
and
tried
to
rob
the
devil
.
The
success
of
the
operation
appears
*NL*
to
be
but
moderate
.
At
least
,
if
the
tradition
is
to
be
believed
,
and
in
*NL*
particular
the
two
enigmatical
lines
in
barbarous
Latin
,
which
an
*NL*
evil
Norman
monk
,
a
bit
of
a
sorcerer
,
named
Tryphon
has
left
on
*NL*
this
subject
.
This
Tryphon
is
buried
at
the
Abbey
of
Saint-Georges
de
*NL*
Bocherville
,
near
Rouen
,
and
toads
spawn
on
his
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
enormous
efforts
are
made
.
Such
trenches
are
ordinarily
*NL*
extremely
deep
;
a
man
sweats
,
digs
,
toils
all
night
--
for
it
must
be
done
*NL*
at
night
;
he
wets
his
shirt
,
burns
out
his
candle
,
breaks
his
mattock
,
*NL*
and
when
he
arrives
at
the
bottom
of
the
hole
,
when
he
lays
his
hand
on
*NL*
the
``
treasure
,
''
what
does
he
find
?
What
is
the
devil
's
treasure
?
A
sou
,
*NL*
sometimes
a
crown-piece
,
a
stone
,
a
skeleton
,
a
bleeding
body
,
sometimes
*NL*
a
spectre
folded
in
four
like
a
sheet
of
paper
in
a
portfolio
,
*NL*
sometimes
nothing
.
This
is
what
Tryphon
's
verses
seem
to
announce
to
the
*NL*
indiscreet
and
curious
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fodit
,
et
in
fossa
thesauros
condit
opaca
,
*NL*
As
,
nummas
,
lapides
,
cadaver
,
simulacra
,
nihilque
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
that
in
our
day
there
is
sometimes
found
a
powder-horn
with
*NL*
bullets
,
sometimes
an
old
pack
of
cards
greasy
and
worn
,
which
has
*NL*
evidently
served
the
devil
.
Tryphon
does
not
record
these
two
finds
,
*NL*
since
Tryphon
lived
in
the
twelfth
century
,
and
since
the
devil
does
not
*NL*
appear
to
have
had
the
wit
to
invent
powder
before
Roger
Bacon
's
time
,
*NL*
and
cards
before
the
time
of
Charles
VI
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
if
one
plays
at
cards
,
one
is
sure
to
lose
all
that
one
*NL*
possesses
!
and
as
for
the
powder
in
the
horn
,
it
possesses
the
property
*NL*
of
making
your
gun
burst
in
your
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
a
very
short
time
after
the
epoch
when
it
seemed
to
the
prosecuting
*NL*
attorney
that
the
liberated
convict
Jean
Valjean
during
his
flight
of
*NL*
several
days
had
been
prowling
around
Montfermeil
,
it
was
remarked
in
*NL*
that
village
that
a
certain
old
road-laborer
,
named
Boulatruelle
,
had
*NL*
``
peculiar
ways
''
in
the
forest
.
People
thereabouts
thought
they
knew
that
*NL*
this
Boulatruelle
had
been
in
the
galleys
.
He
was
subjected
to
*NL*
certain
police
supervision
,
and
,
as
he
could
find
work
nowhere
,
the
*NL*
administration
employed
him
at
reduced
rates
as
a
road-mender
on
the
*NL*
cross-road
from
Gagny
to
Lagny
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Boulatruelle
was
a
man
who
was
viewed
with
disfavor
by
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
district
as
too
respectful
,
too
humble
,
too
prompt
in
*NL*
removing
his
cap
to
every
one
,
and
trembling
and
smiling
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
the
gendarmes
,
--
probably
affiliated
to
robber
bands
,
they
said
;
*NL*
suspected
of
lying
in
ambush
at
verge
of
copses
at
nightfall
.
The
only
*NL*
thing
in
his
favor
was
that
he
was
a
drunkard
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
people
thought
they
had
noticed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Of
late
,
Boulatruelle
had
taken
to
quitting
his
task
of
stone-breaking
*NL*
and
care
of
the
road
at
a
very
early
hour
,
and
to
betaking
himself
to
*NL*
the
forest
with
his
pickaxe
.
He
was
encountered
towards
evening
in
*NL*
the
most
deserted
clearings
,
in
the
wildest
thickets
;
and
he
had
the
*NL*
appearance
of
being
in
search
of
something
,
and
sometimes
he
was
digging
*NL*
holes
.
The
goodwives
who
passed
took
him
at
first
for
Beelzebub
;
then
*NL*
they
recognized
Boulatruelle
,
and
were
not
in
the
least
reassured
*NL*
thereby
.
These
encounters
seemed
to
cause
Boulatruelle
a
lively
*NL*
displeasure
.
It
was
evident
that
he
sought
to
hide
,
and
that
there
was
*NL*
some
mystery
in
what
he
was
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
said
in
the
village
:
``
It
is
clear
that
the
devil
has
appeared
.
*NL*
Boulatruelle
has
seen
him
,
and
is
on
the
search
.
In
sooth
,
he
is
cunning
*NL*
enough
to
pocket
Lucifer
's
hoard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Voltairians
added
,
``
Will
Boulatruelle
catch
the
devil
,
or
will
the
*NL*
devil
catch
Boulatruelle
?
''
The
old
women
made
a
great
many
signs
of
the
*NL*
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Boulatruelle
's
manoeuvres
in
the
forest
ceased
;
and
he
*NL*
resumed
his
regular
occupation
of
roadmending
;
and
people
gossiped
of
*NL*
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
persons
,
however
,
were
still
curious
,
surmising
that
in
all
this
*NL*
there
was
probably
no
fabulous
treasure
of
the
legends
,
but
some
*NL*
fine
windfall
of
a
more
serious
and
palpable
sort
than
the
devil
's
*NL*
bank-bills
,
and
that
the
road-mender
had
half
discovered
the
secret
.
The
*NL*
most
``
puzzled
''
were
the
school-master
and
Thenardier
,
the
proprietor
of
*NL*
the
tavern
,
who
was
everybody
's
friend
,
and
had
not
disdained
to
ally
*NL*
himself
with
Boulatruelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
been
in
the
galleys
,
''
said
Thenardier
.
``
Eh
!
Good
God
!
no
one
*NL*
knows
who
has
been
there
or
will
be
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
the
schoolmaster
affirmed
that
in
former
times
the
law
would
*NL*
have
instituted
an
inquiry
as
to
what
Boulatruelle
did
in
the
forest
,
*NL*
and
that
the
latter
would
have
been
forced
to
speak
,
and
that
he
would
*NL*
have
been
put
to
the
torture
in
case
of
need
,
and
that
Boulatruelle
*NL*
would
not
have
resisted
the
water
test
,
for
example
.
``
Let
us
put
him
to
*NL*
the
wine
test
,
''
said
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
an
effort
,
and
got
the
old
road-mender
to
drinking
.
*NL*
Boulatruelle
drank
an
enormous
amount
,
but
said
very
little
.
He
combined
*NL*
with
admirable
art
,
and
in
masterly
proportions
,
the
thirst
of
a
*NL*
gormandizer
with
the
discretion
of
a
judge
.
Nevertheless
,
by
dint
of
*NL*
returning
to
the
charge
and
of
comparing
and
putting
together
the
few
*NL*
obscure
words
which
he
did
allow
to
escape
him
,
this
is
what
Thenardier
*NL*
and
the
schoolmaster
imagined
that
they
had
made
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
when
Boulatruelle
was
on
his
way
to
his
work
,
at
daybreak
,
*NL*
he
had
been
surprised
to
see
,
at
a
nook
of
the
forest
in
the
underbrush
,
*NL*
a
shovel
and
a
pickaxe
,
concealed
,
as
one
might
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
might
have
supposed
that
they
were
probably
the
shovel
and
*NL*
pick
of
Father
Six-Fours
,
the
water-carrier
,
and
would
have
thought
no
*NL*
more
about
it
.
But
,
on
the
evening
of
that
day
,
he
saw
,
without
being
*NL*
seen
himself
,
as
he
was
hidden
by
a
large
tree
,
``
a
person
who
did
not
*NL*
belong
in
those
parts
,
and
whom
he
,
Boulatruelle
,
knew
well
,
''
directing
*NL*
his
steps
towards
the
densest
part
of
the
wood
.
Translation
by
*NL*
Thenardier
:
A
comrade
of
the
galleys
.
Boulatruelle
obstinately
refused
*NL*
to
reveal
his
name
.
This
person
carried
a
package
--
something
square
,
*NL*
like
a
large
box
or
a
small
trunk
.
Surprise
on
the
part
of
Boulatruelle
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
only
after
the
expiration
of
seven
or
eight
minutes
that
*NL*
the
idea
of
following
that
``
person
''
had
occurred
to
him
.
But
it
was
too
*NL*
late
;
the
person
was
already
in
the
thicket
,
night
had
descended
,
and
*NL*
Boulatruelle
had
not
been
able
to
catch
up
with
him
.
Then
he
had
*NL*
adopted
the
course
of
watching
for
him
at
the
edge
of
the
woods
.
``
It
was
*NL*
moonlight
.
''
Two
or
three
hours
later
,
Boulatruelle
had
seen
this
person
*NL*
emerge
from
the
brushwood
,
carrying
no
longer
the
coffer
,
but
a
shovel
*NL*
and
pick
.
Boulatruelle
had
allowed
the
person
to
pass
,
and
had
not
*NL*
dreamed
of
accosting
him
,
because
he
said
to
himself
that
the
other
man
*NL*
was
three
times
as
strong
as
he
was
,
and
armed
with
a
pickaxe
,
and
that
*NL*
he
would
probably
knock
him
over
the
head
on
recognizing
him
,
and
on
*NL*
perceiving
that
he
was
recognized
.
Touching
effusion
of
two
old
comrades
*NL*
on
meeting
again
.
But
the
shovel
and
pick
had
served
as
a
ray
of
light
*NL*
to
Boulatruelle
;
he
had
hastened
to
the
thicket
in
the
morning
,
and
had
*NL*
found
neither
shovel
nor
pick
.
From
this
he
had
drawn
the
inference
that
*NL*
this
person
,
once
in
the
forest
,
had
dug
a
hole
with
his
pick
,
buried
*NL*
the
coffer
,
and
reclosed
the
hole
with
his
shovel
.
Now
,
the
coffer
was
*NL*
too
small
to
contain
a
body
;
therefore
it
contained
money
.
Hence
his
*NL*
researches
.
Boulatruelle
had
explored
,
sounded
,
searched
the
entire
*NL*
forest
and
the
thicket
,
and
had
dug
wherever
the
earth
appeared
to
him
*NL*
to
have
been
recently
turned
up
.
In
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
``
ferreted
out
''
nothing
.
No
one
in
Montfermeil
thought
any
more
*NL*
about
it
.
There
were
only
a
few
brave
gossips
,
who
said
,
``
You
may
be
*NL*
certain
that
the
mender
on
the
Gagny
road
did
not
take
all
that
trouble
*NL*
for
nothing
;
he
was
sure
that
the
devil
had
come
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
ANKLE-CHAIN
MUST
HAVE
UNDERGONE
A
CERTAIN
PREPARATORY
*NL*
MANIPULATION
TO
BE
THUS
BROKEN
WITH
A
BLOW
FROM
A
HAMMER
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
October
,
in
that
same
year
,
1823
,
the
inhabitants
of
*NL*
Toulon
beheld
the
entry
into
their
port
,
after
heavy
weather
,
and
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
repairing
some
damages
,
of
the
ship
Orion
,
which
was
*NL*
employed
later
at
Brest
as
a
school-ship
,
and
which
then
formed
a
part
*NL*
of
the
Mediterranean
squadron
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
vessel
,
battered
as
it
was
,
--
for
the
sea
had
handled
it
*NL*
roughly
,
--
produced
a
fine
effect
as
it
entered
the
roads
.
It
flew
some
*NL*
colors
which
procured
for
it
the
regulation
salute
of
eleven
guns
,
which
*NL*
it
returned
,
shot
for
shot
;
total
,
twenty-two
.
It
has
been
calculated
*NL*
that
what
with
salvos
,
royal
and
military
politenesses
,
courteous
*NL*
exchanges
of
uproar
,
signals
of
etiquette
,
formalities
of
roadsteads
and
*NL*
citadels
,
sunrises
and
sunsets
,
saluted
every
day
by
all
fortresses
and
*NL*
all
ships
of
war
,
openings
and
closings
of
ports
,
etc.
,
the
civilized
*NL*
world
,
discharged
all
over
the
earth
,
in
the
course
of
four
and
twenty
*NL*
hours
,
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
useless
shots
.
At
six
francs
the
*NL*
shot
,
that
comes
to
nine
hundred
thousand
francs
a
day
,
three
hundred
*NL*
millions
a
year
,
which
vanish
in
smoke
.
This
is
a
mere
detail
.
All
this
*NL*
time
the
poor
were
dying
of
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
year
1823
was
what
the
Restoration
called
``
the
epoch
of
the
Spanish
*NL*
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
war
contained
many
events
in
one
,
and
a
quantity
of
peculiarities
.
*NL*
A
grand
family
affair
for
the
house
of
Bourbon
;
the
branch
of
France
*NL*
succoring
and
protecting
the
branch
of
Madrid
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
performing
an
act
devolving
on
the
elder
;
an
apparent
return
to
our
*NL*
national
traditions
,
complicated
by
servitude
and
by
subjection
to
the
*NL*
cabinets
of
the
North
;
M.
le
Duc
d'Angouleme
,
surnamed
by
the
liberal
*NL*
sheets
the
hero
of
Andujar
,
compressing
in
a
triumphal
attitude
that
*NL*
was
somewhat
contradicted
by
his
peaceable
air
,
the
ancient
and
very
*NL*
powerful
terrorism
of
the
Holy
Office
at
variance
with
the
chimerical
*NL*
terrorism
of
the
liberals
;
the
sansculottes
resuscitated
,
to
the
great
*NL*
terror
of
dowagers
,
under
the
name
of
descamisados
;
monarchy
opposing
an
*NL*
obstacle
to
progress
described
as
anarchy
;
the
theories
of
'89
roughly
*NL*
interrupted
in
the
sap
;
a
European
halt
,
called
to
the
French
idea
,
*NL*
which
was
making
the
tour
of
the
world
;
beside
the
son
of
France
as
*NL*
generalissimo
,
the
Prince
de
Carignan
,
afterwards
Charles
Albert
,
*NL*
enrolling
himself
in
that
crusade
of
kings
against
people
as
a
*NL*
volunteer
,
with
grenadier
epaulets
of
red
worsted
;
the
soldiers
of
the
*NL*
Empire
setting
out
on
a
fresh
campaign
,
but
aged
,
saddened
,
after
eight
*NL*
years
of
repose
,
and
under
the
white
cockade
;
the
tricolored
standard
*NL*
waved
abroad
by
a
heroic
handful
of
Frenchmen
,
as
the
white
standard
had
*NL*
been
thirty
years
earlier
at
Coblentz
;
monks
mingled
with
our
troops
;
*NL*
the
spirit
of
liberty
and
of
novelty
brought
to
its
senses
by
bayonets
;
*NL*
principles
slaughtered
by
cannonades
;
France
undoing
by
her
arms
that
*NL*
which
she
had
done
by
her
mind
;
in
addition
to
this
,
hostile
leaders
*NL*
sold
,
soldiers
hesitating
,
cities
besieged
by
millions
;
no
military
*NL*
perils
,
and
yet
possible
explosions
,
as
in
every
mine
which
is
surprised
*NL*
and
invaded
;
but
little
bloodshed
,
little
honor
won
,
shame
for
some
,
*NL*
glory
for
no
one
.
Such
was
this
war
,
made
by
the
princes
descended
from
*NL*
Louis
XIV.
,
and
conducted
by
generals
who
had
been
under
Napoleon
.
Its
*NL*
sad
fate
was
to
recall
neither
the
grand
war
nor
grand
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
feats
of
arms
were
serious
;
the
taking
of
the
Trocadero
,
among
*NL*
others
,
was
a
fine
military
action
;
but
after
all
,
we
repeat
,
the
*NL*
trumpets
of
this
war
give
back
a
cracked
sound
,
the
whole
effect
was
*NL*
suspicious
;
history
approves
of
France
for
making
a
difficulty
about
*NL*
accepting
this
false
triumph
.
It
seemed
evident
that
certain
Spanish
*NL*
officers
charged
with
resistance
yielded
too
easily
;
the
idea
of
*NL*
corruption
was
connected
with
the
victory
;
it
appears
as
though
generals
*NL*
and
not
battles
had
been
won
,
and
the
conquering
soldier
returned
*NL*
humiliated
.
A
debasing
war
,
in
short
,
in
which
the
Bank
of
France
could
*NL*
be
read
in
the
folds
of
the
flag
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soldiers
of
the
war
of
1808
,
on
whom
Saragossa
had
fallen
in
formidable
*NL*
ruin
,
frowned
in
1823
at
the
easy
surrender
of
citadels
,
and
began
to
*NL*
regret
Palafox
.
It
is
the
nature
of
France
to
prefer
to
have
Rostopchine
*NL*
rather
than
Ballesteros
in
front
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
still
more
serious
point
of
view
,
and
one
which
it
is
also
proper
*NL*
to
insist
upon
here
,
this
war
,
which
wounded
the
military
spirit
*NL*
of
France
,
enraged
the
democratic
spirit
.
It
was
an
enterprise
of
*NL*
inthralment
.
In
that
campaign
,
the
object
of
the
French
soldier
,
the
*NL*
son
of
democracy
,
was
the
conquest
of
a
yoke
for
others
.
A
hideous
*NL*
contradiction
.
France
is
made
to
arouse
the
soul
of
nations
,
not
to
*NL*
stifle
it
.
All
the
revolutions
of
Europe
since
1792
are
the
French
*NL*
Revolution
:
liberty
darts
rays
from
France
.
That
is
a
solar
fact
.
Blind
*NL*
is
he
who
will
not
see
!
It
was
Bonaparte
who
said
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
war
of
1823
,
an
outrage
on
the
generous
Spanish
nation
,
was
then
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
an
outrage
on
the
French
Revolution
.
It
was
France
*NL*
who
committed
this
monstrous
violence
;
by
foul
means
,
for
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
wars
of
liberation
,
everything
that
armies
do
is
by
foul
*NL*
means
.
The
words
passive
obedience
indicate
this
.
An
army
is
a
strange
*NL*
masterpiece
of
combination
where
force
results
from
an
enormous
sum
*NL*
of
impotence
.
Thus
is
war
,
made
by
humanity
against
humanity
,
despite
*NL*
humanity
,
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
Bourbons
,
the
war
of
1823
was
fatal
to
them
.
They
took
it
for
*NL*
a
success
.
They
did
not
perceive
the
danger
that
lies
in
having
an
idea
*NL*
slain
to
order
.
They
went
astray
,
in
their
innocence
,
to
such
a
degree
*NL*
that
they
introduced
the
immense
enfeeblement
of
a
crime
into
their
*NL*
establishment
as
an
element
of
strength
.
The
spirit
of
the
ambush
*NL*
entered
into
their
politics
.
1830
had
its
germ
in
1823
.
The
Spanish
*NL*
campaign
became
in
their
counsels
an
argument
for
force
and
for
*NL*
adventures
by
right
Divine
.
France
,
having
re-established
elrey
netto
*NL*
in
Spain
,
might
well
have
re-established
the
absolute
king
at
home
.
They
*NL*
fell
into
the
alarming
error
of
taking
the
obedience
of
the
soldier
for
*NL*
the
consent
of
the
nation
.
Such
confidence
is
the
ruin
of
thrones
.
It
is
*NL*
not
permitted
to
fall
asleep
,
either
in
the
shadow
of
a
machineel
tree
,
*NL*
nor
in
the
shadow
of
an
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
the
ship
Orion
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
operations
of
the
army
commanded
by
the
prince
generalissimo
,
*NL*
a
squadron
had
been
cruising
in
the
Mediterranean
.
We
have
just
stated
*NL*
that
the
Orion
belonged
to
this
fleet
,
and
that
accidents
of
the
sea
had
*NL*
brought
it
into
port
at
Toulon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
a
vessel
of
war
in
a
port
has
something
about
it
which
*NL*
attracts
and
engages
a
crowd
.
It
is
because
it
is
great
,
and
the
crowd
*NL*
loves
what
is
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ship
of
the
line
is
one
of
the
most
magnificent
combinations
of
the
*NL*
genius
of
man
with
the
powers
of
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ship
of
the
line
is
composed
,
at
the
same
time
,
of
the
heaviest
and
*NL*
the
lightest
of
possible
matter
,
for
it
deals
at
one
and
the
same
time
*NL*
with
three
forms
of
substance
,
--
solid
,
liquid
,
and
fluid
,
--
and
it
must
*NL*
do
battle
with
all
three
.
It
has
eleven
claws
of
iron
with
which
to
*NL*
seize
the
granite
on
the
bottom
of
the
sea
,
and
more
wings
and
more
*NL*
antennae
than
winged
insects
,
to
catch
the
wind
in
the
clouds
.
Its
*NL*
breath
pours
out
through
its
hundred
and
twenty
cannons
as
through
*NL*
enormous
trumpets
,
and
replies
proudly
to
the
thunder
.
The
ocean
seeks
*NL*
to
lead
it
astray
in
the
alarming
sameness
of
its
billows
,
but
the
*NL*
vessel
has
its
soul
,
its
compass
,
which
counsels
it
and
always
shows
it
*NL*
the
north
.
In
the
blackest
nights
,
its
lanterns
supply
the
place
of
*NL*
the
stars
.
Thus
,
against
the
wind
,
it
has
its
cordage
and
its
canvas
;
*NL*
against
the
water
,
wood
;
against
the
rocks
,
its
iron
,
brass
,
and
lead
;
*NL*
against
the
shadows
,
its
light
;
against
immensity
,
a
needle
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
wishes
to
form
an
idea
of
all
those
gigantic
proportions
which
,
*NL*
taken
as
a
whole
,
constitute
the
ship
of
the
line
,
one
has
only
to
enter
*NL*
one
of
the
six-story
covered
construction
stocks
,
in
the
ports
of
Brest
*NL*
or
Toulon
.
The
vessels
in
process
of
construction
are
under
a
bell-glass
*NL*
there
,
as
it
were
.
This
colossal
beam
is
a
yard
;
that
great
column
of
*NL*
wood
which
stretches
out
on
the
earth
as
far
as
the
eye
can
reach
is
*NL*
the
main-mast
.
Taking
it
from
its
root
in
the
stocks
to
its
tip
in
the
*NL*
clouds
,
it
is
sixty
fathoms
long
,
and
its
diameter
at
its
base
is
*NL*
three
feet
.
The
English
main-mast
rises
to
a
height
of
two
hundred
and
*NL*
seventeen
feet
above
the
water-line
.
The
navy
of
our
fathers
employed
*NL*
cables
,
ours
employs
chains
.
The
simple
pile
of
chains
on
a
ship
of
a
*NL*
hundred
guns
is
four
feet
high
,
twenty
feet
in
breadth
,
and
eight
*NL*
feet
in
depth
.
And
how
much
wood
is
required
to
make
this
ship
?
Three
*NL*
thousand
cubic
metres
.
It
is
a
floating
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
moreover
,
let
this
be
borne
in
mind
,
it
is
only
a
question
here
of
*NL*
the
military
vessel
of
forty
years
ago
,
of
the
simple
sailing-vessel
;
*NL*
steam
,
then
in
its
infancy
,
has
since
added
new
miracles
to
that
prodigy
*NL*
which
is
called
a
war
vessel
.
At
the
present
time
,
for
example
,
the
*NL*
mixed
vessel
with
a
screw
is
a
surprising
machine
,
propelled
by
three
*NL*
thousand
square
metres
of
canvas
and
by
an
engine
of
two
thousand
five
*NL*
hundred
horse-power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
mention
these
new
marvels
,
the
ancient
vessel
of
Christopher
*NL*
Columbus
and
of
De
Ruyter
is
one
of
the
masterpieces
of
man
.
It
is
as
*NL*
inexhaustible
in
force
as
is
the
Infinite
in
gales
;
it
stores
up
*NL*
the
wind
in
its
sails
,
it
is
precise
in
the
immense
vagueness
of
the
*NL*
billows
,
it
floats
,
and
it
reigns
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
comes
an
hour
,
nevertheless
,
when
the
gale
breaks
that
sixty-foot
*NL*
yard
like
a
straw
,
when
the
wind
bends
that
mast
four
hundred
feet
tall
,
*NL*
when
that
anchor
,
which
weighs
tens
of
thousands
,
is
twisted
in
the
jaws
*NL*
of
the
waves
like
a
fisherman
's
hook
in
the
jaws
of
a
pike
,
when
those
*NL*
monstrous
cannons
utter
plaintive
and
futile
roars
,
which
the
hurricane
*NL*
bears
forth
into
the
void
and
into
night
,
when
all
that
power
and
all
*NL*
that
majesty
are
engulfed
in
a
power
and
majesty
which
are
superior
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
time
that
immense
force
is
displayed
to
culminate
in
an
immense
*NL*
feebleness
it
affords
men
food
for
thought
,
Hence
in
the
ports
curious
*NL*
people
abound
around
these
marvellous
machines
of
war
and
of
navigation
,
*NL*
without
being
able
to
explain
perfectly
to
themselves
why
.
Every
day
,
*NL*
accordingly
,
from
morning
until
night
,
the
quays
,
sluices
,
and
the
*NL*
jetties
of
the
port
of
Toulon
were
covered
with
a
multitude
of
idlers
*NL*
and
loungers
,
as
they
say
in
Paris
,
whose
business
consisted
in
staring
*NL*
at
the
Orion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Orion
was
a
ship
that
had
been
ailing
for
a
long
time
;
in
the
course
*NL*
of
its
previous
cruises
thick
layers
of
barnacles
had
collected
on
its
*NL*
keel
to
such
a
degree
as
to
deprive
it
of
half
its
speed
;
it
had
gone
*NL*
into
the
dry
dock
the
year
before
this
,
in
order
to
have
the
barnacles
*NL*
scraped
off
,
then
it
had
put
to
sea
again
;
but
this
cleaning
had
*NL*
affected
the
bolts
of
the
keel
:
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
Balearic
*NL*
Isles
the
sides
had
been
strained
and
had
opened
;
and
,
as
the
plating
*NL*
in
those
days
was
not
of
sheet
iron
,
the
vessel
had
sprung
a
leak
.
*NL*
A
violent
equinoctial
gale
had
come
up
,
which
had
first
staved
in
*NL*
a
grating
and
a
porthole
on
the
larboard
side
,
and
damaged
the
*NL*
foretop-gallant-shrouds
;
in
consequence
of
these
injuries
,
the
Orion
had
*NL*
run
back
to
Toulon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
anchored
near
the
Arsenal
;
it
was
fully
equipped
,
and
repairs
were
*NL*
begun
.
The
hull
had
received
no
damage
on
the
starboard
,
but
some
of
the
*NL*
planks
had
been
unnailed
here
and
there
,
according
to
custom
,
to
permit
*NL*
of
air
entering
the
hold
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
the
crowd
which
was
gazing
at
it
witnessed
an
accident
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
crew
was
busy
bending
the
sails
;
the
topman
,
who
had
to
take
the
*NL*
upper
corner
of
the
main-top-sail
on
the
starboard
,
lost
his
balance
;
*NL*
he
was
seen
to
waver
;
the
multitude
thronging
the
Arsenal
quay
uttered
a
*NL*
cry
;
the
man
's
head
overbalanced
his
body
;
the
man
fell
around
the
yard
,
*NL*
with
his
hands
outstretched
towards
the
abyss
;
on
his
way
he
seized
the
*NL*
footrope
,
first
with
one
hand
,
then
with
the
other
,
and
remained
hanging
*NL*
from
it
:
the
sea
lay
below
him
at
a
dizzy
depth
;
the
shock
of
his
fall
*NL*
had
imparted
to
the
foot-rope
a
violent
swinging
motion
;
the
man
swayed
*NL*
back
and
forth
at
the
end
of
that
rope
,
like
a
stone
in
a
sling
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
incurring
a
frightful
risk
to
go
to
his
assistance
;
not
one
*NL*
of
the
sailors
,
all
fishermen
of
the
coast
,
recently
levied
for
the
*NL*
service
,
dared
to
attempt
it
.
In
the
meantime
,
the
unfortunate
topman
*NL*
was
losing
his
strength
;
his
anguish
could
not
be
discerned
on
his
face
,
*NL*
but
his
exhaustion
was
visible
in
every
limb
;
his
arms
were
contracted
*NL*
in
horrible
twitchings
;
every
effort
which
he
made
to
re-ascend
served
*NL*
but
to
augment
the
oscillations
of
the
foot-rope
;
he
did
not
shout
,
for
*NL*
fear
of
exhausting
his
strength
.
All
were
awaiting
the
minute
when
he
*NL*
should
release
his
hold
on
the
rope
,
and
,
from
instant
to
instant
,
heads
*NL*
were
turned
aside
that
his
fall
might
not
be
seen
.
There
are
moments
*NL*
when
a
bit
of
rope
,
a
pole
,
the
branch
of
a
tree
,
is
life
itself
,
and
*NL*
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
see
a
living
being
detach
himself
from
it
and
*NL*
fall
like
a
ripe
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
a
man
was
seen
climbing
into
the
rigging
with
the
agility
*NL*
of
a
tiger-cat
;
this
man
was
dressed
in
red
;
he
was
a
convict
;
he
wore
a
*NL*
green
cap
;
he
was
a
life
convict
.
On
arriving
on
a
level
with
the
top
,
a
*NL*
gust
of
wind
carried
away
his
cap
,
and
allowed
a
perfectly
white
head
to
*NL*
be
seen
:
he
was
not
a
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
convict
employed
on
board
with
a
detachment
from
the
galleys
had
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
at
the
very
first
instant
,
hastened
to
the
officer
of
the
watch
,
*NL*
and
,
in
the
midst
of
the
consternation
and
the
hesitation
of
the
crew
,
*NL*
while
all
the
sailors
were
trembling
and
drawing
back
,
he
had
asked
*NL*
the
officer
's
permission
to
risk
his
life
to
save
the
topman
;
at
an
*NL*
affirmative
sign
from
the
officer
he
had
broken
the
chain
riveted
to
his
*NL*
ankle
with
one
blow
of
a
hammer
,
then
he
had
caught
up
a
rope
,
and
had
*NL*
dashed
into
the
rigging
:
no
one
noticed
,
at
the
instant
,
with
what
ease
*NL*
that
chain
had
been
broken
;
it
was
only
later
on
that
the
incident
was
*NL*
recalled
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
twinkling
he
was
on
the
yard
;
he
paused
for
a
few
seconds
and
*NL*
appeared
to
be
measuring
it
with
his
eye
;
these
seconds
,
during
which
*NL*
the
breeze
swayed
the
topman
at
the
extremity
of
a
thread
,
seemed
*NL*
centuries
to
those
who
were
looking
on
.
At
last
,
the
convict
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
to
heaven
and
advanced
a
step
:
the
crowd
drew
a
long
breath
.
He
was
*NL*
seen
to
run
out
along
the
yard
:
on
arriving
at
the
point
,
he
fastened
*NL*
the
rope
which
he
had
brought
to
it
,
and
allowed
the
other
end
to
hang
*NL*
down
,
then
he
began
to
descend
the
rope
,
hand
over
hand
,
and
then
,
--
and
*NL*
the
anguish
was
indescribable
,
--
instead
of
one
man
suspended
over
the
*NL*
gulf
,
there
were
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
said
it
was
a
spider
coming
to
seize
a
fly
,
only
here
the
*NL*
spider
brought
life
,
not
death
.
Ten
thousand
glances
were
fastened
on
*NL*
this
group
;
not
a
cry
,
not
a
word
;
the
same
tremor
contracted
every
*NL*
brow
;
all
mouths
held
their
breath
as
though
they
feared
to
add
the
*NL*
slightest
puff
to
the
wind
which
was
swaying
the
two
unfortunate
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
convict
had
succeeded
in
lowering
himself
to
a
*NL*
position
near
the
sailor
.
It
was
high
time
;
one
minute
more
,
and
the
*NL*
exhausted
and
despairing
man
would
have
allowed
himself
to
fall
into
*NL*
the
abyss
.
The
convict
had
moored
him
securely
with
the
cord
to
which
*NL*
he
clung
with
one
hand
,
while
he
was
working
with
the
other
.
At
last
,
he
*NL*
was
seen
to
climb
back
on
the
yard
,
and
to
drag
the
sailor
up
after
him
;
*NL*
he
held
him
there
a
moment
to
allow
him
to
recover
his
strength
,
then
he
*NL*
grasped
him
in
his
arms
and
carried
him
,
walking
on
the
yard
himself
to
*NL*
the
cap
,
and
from
there
to
the
main-top
,
where
he
left
him
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
his
comrades
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
crowd
broke
into
applause
:
old
convict-sergeants
*NL*
among
them
wept
,
and
women
embraced
each
other
on
the
quay
,
and
all
*NL*
voices
were
heard
to
cry
with
a
sort
of
tender
rage
,
``
Pardon
for
that
*NL*
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
in
the
meantime
,
had
immediately
begun
to
make
his
descent
to
rejoin
*NL*
his
detachment
.
In
order
to
reach
them
the
more
speedily
,
he
dropped
*NL*
into
the
rigging
,
and
ran
along
one
of
the
lower
yards
;
all
eyes
were
*NL*
following
him
.
At
a
certain
moment
fear
assailed
them
;
whether
it
was
*NL*
that
he
was
fatigued
,
or
that
his
head
turned
,
they
thought
they
saw
him
*NL*
hesitate
and
stagger
.
All
at
once
the
crowd
uttered
a
loud
shout
:
the
*NL*
convict
had
fallen
into
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fall
was
perilous
.
The
frigate
Algesiras
was
anchored
alongside
the
*NL*
Orion
,
and
the
poor
convict
had
fallen
between
the
two
vessels
:
it
was
*NL*
to
be
feared
that
he
would
slip
under
one
or
the
other
of
them
.
Four
men
*NL*
flung
themselves
hastily
into
a
boat
;
the
crowd
cheered
them
on
;
*NL*
anxiety
again
took
possession
of
all
souls
;
the
man
had
not
risen
to
*NL*
the
surface
;
he
had
disappeared
in
the
sea
without
leaving
a
ripple
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
fallen
into
a
cask
of
oil
:
they
sounded
,
they
dived
.
In
*NL*
vain
.
The
search
was
continued
until
the
evening
:
they
did
not
even
find
*NL*
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
the
Toulon
newspaper
printed
these
lines
:
--

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
WATER
QUESTION
AT
MONTFERMEIL
*NL*
*NL*
Montfermeil
is
situated
between
Livry
and
Chelles
,
on
the
southern
edge
*NL*
of
that
lofty
table-land
which
separates
the
Ourcq
from
the
Marne
.
At
*NL*
the
present
day
it
is
a
tolerably
large
town
,
ornamented
all
the
year
*NL*
through
with
plaster
villas
,
and
on
Sundays
with
beaming
bourgeois
.
In
*NL*
1823
there
were
at
Montfermeil
neither
so
many
white
houses
nor
so
*NL*
many
well-satisfied
citizens
:
it
was
only
a
village
in
the
forest
.
Some
*NL*
pleasure-houses
of
the
last
century
were
to
be
met
with
there
,
to
be
*NL*
sure
,
which
were
recognizable
by
their
grand
air
,
their
balconies
in
*NL*
twisted
iron
,
and
their
long
windows
,
whose
tiny
panes
cast
all
sorts
*NL*
of
varying
shades
of
green
on
the
white
of
the
closed
shutters
;
but
*NL*
Montfermeil
was
none
the
less
a
village
.
Retired
cloth-merchants
and
*NL*
rusticating
attorneys
had
not
discovered
it
as
yet
;
it
was
a
peaceful
*NL*
and
charming
place
,
which
was
not
on
the
road
to
anywhere
:
there
people
*NL*
lived
,
and
cheaply
,
that
peasant
rustic
life
which
is
so
bounteous
and
*NL*
so
easy
;
only
,
water
was
rare
there
,
on
account
of
the
elevation
of
the
*NL*
plateau
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
necessary
to
fetch
it
from
a
considerable
distance
;
the
end
of
*NL*
the
village
towards
Gagny
drew
its
water
from
the
magnificent
ponds
*NL*
which
exist
in
the
woods
there
.
The
other
end
,
which
surrounds
the
*NL*
church
and
which
lies
in
the
direction
of
Chelles
,
found
drinking-water
*NL*
only
at
a
little
spring
half-way
down
the
slope
,
near
the
road
to
*NL*
Chelles
,
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
from
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
each
household
found
it
hard
work
to
keep
supplied
with
water
.
The
*NL*
large
houses
,
the
aristocracy
,
of
which
the
Thenardier
tavern
formed
a
*NL*
part
,
paid
half
a
farthing
a
bucketful
to
a
man
who
made
a
business
of
*NL*
it
,
and
who
earned
about
eight
sous
a
day
in
his
enterprise
of
supplying
*NL*
Montfermeil
with
water
;
but
this
good
man
only
worked
until
seven
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
in
summer
,
and
five
in
winter
;
and
night
once
*NL*
come
and
the
shutters
on
the
ground
floor
once
closed
,
he
who
had
no
*NL*
water
to
drink
went
to
fetch
it
for
himself
or
did
without
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
constituted
the
terror
of
the
poor
creature
whom
the
reader
has
*NL*
probably
not
forgotten
,
--
little
Cosette
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
*NL*
Cosette
was
useful
to
the
Thenardiers
in
two
ways
:
they
made
the
mother
*NL*
pay
them
,
and
they
made
the
child
serve
them
.
So
when
the
mother
ceased
*NL*
to
pay
altogether
,
the
reason
for
which
we
have
read
in
preceding
*NL*
chapters
,
the
Thenardiers
kept
Cosette
.
She
took
the
place
of
a
servant
*NL*
in
their
house
.
In
this
capacity
she
it
was
who
ran
to
fetch
water
when
*NL*
it
was
required
.
So
the
child
,
who
was
greatly
terrified
at
the
idea
of
*NL*
going
to
the
spring
at
night
,
took
great
care
that
water
should
never
be
*NL*
lacking
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas
of
the
year
1823
was
particularly
brilliant
at
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
The
beginning
of
the
winter
had
been
mild
;
there
had
been
neither
snow
*NL*
nor
frost
up
to
that
time
.
Some
mountebanks
from
Paris
had
obtained
*NL*
permission
of
the
mayor
to
erect
their
booths
in
the
principal
street
of
*NL*
the
village
,
and
a
band
of
itinerant
merchants
,
under
protection
of
the
*NL*
same
tolerance
,
had
constructed
their
stalls
on
the
Church
Square
,
*NL*
and
even
extended
them
into
Boulanger
Alley
,
where
,
as
the
reader
will
*NL*
perhaps
remember
,
the
Thenardiers
'
hostelry
was
situated
.
These
people
*NL*
filled
the
inns
and
drinking-shops
,
and
communicated
to
that
tranquil
*NL*
little
district
a
noisy
and
joyous
life
.
In
order
to
play
the
part
of
*NL*
a
faithful
historian
,
we
ought
even
to
add
that
,
among
the
curiosities
*NL*
displayed
in
the
square
,
there
was
a
menagerie
,
in
which
frightful
*NL*
clowns
,
clad
in
rags
and
coming
no
one
knew
whence
,
exhibited
to
*NL*
the
peasants
of
Montfermeil
in
1823
one
of
those
horrible
Brazilian
*NL*
vultures
,
such
as
our
Royal
Museum
did
not
possess
until
1845
,
and
which
*NL*
have
a
tricolored
cockade
for
an
eye
.
I
believe
that
naturalists
call
*NL*
this
bird
Caracara
Polyborus
;
it
belongs
to
the
order
of
the
Apicides
,
*NL*
and
to
the
family
of
the
vultures
.
Some
good
old
Bonapartist
soldiers
,
*NL*
who
had
retired
to
the
village
,
went
to
see
this
creature
with
great
*NL*
devotion
.
The
mountebanks
gave
out
that
the
tricolored
cockade
was
a
*NL*
unique
phenomenon
made
by
God
expressly
for
their
menagerie
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Christmas
eve
itself
,
a
number
of
men
,
carters
,
and
peddlers
,
were
*NL*
seated
at
table
,
drinking
and
smoking
around
four
or
five
candles
in
*NL*
the
public
room
of
Thenardier
's
hostelry
.
This
room
resembled
all
*NL*
drinking-shop
rooms
,
--
tables
,
pewter
jugs
,
bottles
,
drinkers
,
smokers
;
*NL*
but
little
light
and
a
great
deal
of
noise
.
The
date
of
the
year
1823
*NL*
was
indicated
,
nevertheless
,
by
two
objects
which
were
then
fashionable
*NL*
in
the
bourgeois
class
:
to
wit
,
a
kaleidoscope
and
a
lamp
of
ribbed
tin
.
*NL*
The
female
Thenardier
was
attending
to
the
supper
,
which
was
roasting
in
*NL*
front
of
a
clear
fire
;
her
husband
was
drinking
with
his
customers
and
*NL*
talking
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
political
conversations
which
had
for
their
principal
subjects
*NL*
the
Spanish
war
and
M.
le
Duc
d'Angouleme
,
strictly
local
parentheses
,
*NL*
like
the
following
,
were
audible
amid
the
uproar
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Nanterre
and
Suresnes
the
vines
have
flourished
greatly
.
When
*NL*
ten
pieces
were
reckoned
on
there
have
been
twelve
.
They
have
yielded
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
juice
under
the
press
.
''
``
But
the
grapes
can
not
be
ripe
?
''
*NL*
``
In
those
parts
the
grapes
should
not
be
ripe
;
the
wine
turns
oily
as
*NL*
soon
as
spring
comes
.
''
``
Then
it
is
very
thin
wine
?
''
``
There
are
wines
*NL*
poorer
even
than
these
.
The
grapes
must
be
gathered
while
green
.
''
Etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
a
miller
would
call
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
we
responsible
for
what
is
in
the
sacks
?
We
find
in
them
a
quantity
*NL*
of
small
seed
which
we
can
not
sift
out
,
and
which
we
are
obliged
to
send
*NL*
through
the
mill-stones
;
there
are
tares
,
fennel
,
vetches
,
hempseed
,
*NL*
fox-tail
,
and
a
host
of
other
weeds
,
not
to
mention
pebbles
,
which
*NL*
abound
in
certain
wheat
,
especially
in
Breton
wheat
.
I
am
not
fond
of
*NL*
grinding
Breton
wheat
,
any
more
than
long-sawyers
like
to
saw
beams
with
*NL*
nails
in
them
.
You
can
judge
of
the
bad
dust
that
makes
in
grinding
.
And
*NL*
then
people
complain
of
the
flour
.
They
are
in
the
wrong
.
The
flour
is
*NL*
no
fault
of
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
space
between
two
windows
a
mower
,
who
was
seated
at
table
with
a
*NL*
landed
proprietor
who
was
fixing
on
a
price
for
some
meadow
work
to
be
*NL*
performed
in
the
spring
,
was
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
no
harm
to
have
the
grass
wet
.
It
cuts
better
.
Dew
is
a
good
*NL*
thing
,
sir
.
It
makes
no
difference
with
that
grass
.
Your
grass
is
young
*NL*
and
very
hard
to
cut
still
.
It
's
terribly
tender
.
It
yields
before
the
*NL*
iron
.
''
Etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
in
her
usual
place
,
seated
on
the
cross-bar
of
the
kitchen
*NL*
table
near
the
chimney
.
She
was
in
rags
;
her
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
*NL*
wooden
shoes
,
and
by
the
firelight
she
was
engaged
in
knitting
woollen
*NL*
stockings
destined
for
the
young
Thenardiers
.
A
very
young
kitten
was
*NL*
playing
about
among
the
chairs
.
Laughter
and
chatter
were
audible
in
*NL*
the
adjoining
room
,
from
two
fresh
children
's
voices
:
it
was
Eponine
and
*NL*
Azelma
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
chimney-corner
a
cat-o
'
-
nine-tails
was
hanging
on
a
nail
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
intervals
the
cry
of
a
very
young
child
,
which
was
somewhere
in
the
*NL*
house
,
rang
through
the
noise
of
the
dram-shop
.
It
was
a
little
boy
*NL*
who
had
been
born
to
the
Thenardiers
during
one
of
the
preceding
*NL*
winters
,
--
``
she
did
not
know
why
,
''
she
said
,
``
the
result
of
the
*NL*
cold
,
''
--
and
who
was
a
little
more
than
three
years
old
.
The
mother
had
*NL*
nursed
him
,
but
she
did
not
love
him
.
When
the
persistent
clamor
of
the
*NL*
brat
became
too
annoying
,
``
Your
son
is
squalling
,
''
Thenardier
would
*NL*
say
;
``
do
go
and
see
what
he
wants
.
''
``
Bah
!
''
the
mother
would
reply
,
``
he
*NL*
bothers
me
.
''
And
the
neglected
child
continued
to
shriek
in
the
dark
.

CHAPTER
II
--
TWO
COMPLETE
PORTRAITS
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
in
this
book
the
Thenardiers
have
been
viewed
only
in
profile
;
*NL*
the
moment
has
arrived
for
making
the
circuit
of
this
couple
,
and
*NL*
considering
it
under
all
its
aspects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
had
just
passed
his
fiftieth
birthday
;
Madame
Thenardier
was
*NL*
approaching
her
forties
,
which
is
equivalent
to
fifty
in
a
woman
;
so
*NL*
that
there
existed
a
balance
of
age
between
husband
and
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
readers
have
possibly
preserved
some
recollection
of
this
Thenardier
*NL*
woman
,
ever
since
her
first
appearance
,
--
tall
,
blond
,
red
,
fat
,
angular
,
*NL*
square
,
enormous
,
and
agile
;
she
belonged
,
as
we
have
said
,
to
the
*NL*
race
of
those
colossal
wild
women
,
who
contort
themselves
at
fairs
with
*NL*
paving-stones
hanging
from
their
hair
.
She
did
everything
about
the
*NL*
house
,
--
made
the
beds
,
did
the
washing
,
the
cooking
,
and
everything
*NL*
else
.
Cosette
was
her
only
servant
;
a
mouse
in
the
service
of
an
*NL*
elephant
.
Everything
trembled
at
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
--
window
panes
,
*NL*
furniture
,
and
people
.
Her
big
face
,
dotted
with
red
blotches
,
*NL*
presented
the
appearance
of
a
skimmer
.
She
had
a
beard
.
She
was
an
ideal
*NL*
market-porter
dressed
in
woman
's
clothes
.
She
swore
splendidly
;
she
*NL*
boasted
of
being
able
to
crack
a
nut
with
one
blow
of
her
fist
.
Except
*NL*
for
the
romances
which
she
had
read
,
and
which
made
the
affected
lady
*NL*
peep
through
the
ogress
at
times
,
in
a
very
queer
way
,
the
idea
would
*NL*
never
have
occurred
to
any
one
to
say
of
her
,
``
That
is
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
This
Thenardier
female
was
like
the
product
of
a
wench
engrafted
on
a
*NL*
fishwife
.
When
one
heard
her
speak
,
one
said
,
``
That
is
a
gendarme
''
;
when
*NL*
one
saw
her
drink
,
one
said
,
``
That
is
a
carter
''
;
when
one
saw
her
handle
*NL*
Cosette
,
one
said
,
``
That
is
the
hangman
.
''
One
of
her
teeth
projected
*NL*
when
her
face
was
in
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
a
small
,
thin
,
pale
,
angular
,
bony
,
feeble
man
,
who
had
*NL*
a
sickly
air
and
who
was
wonderfully
healthy
.
His
cunning
began
here
;
*NL*
he
smiled
habitually
,
by
way
of
precaution
,
and
was
almost
polite
to
*NL*
everybody
,
even
to
the
beggar
to
whom
he
refused
half
a
farthing
.
He
had
*NL*
the
glance
of
a
pole-cat
and
the
bearing
of
a
man
of
letters
.
He
greatly
*NL*
resembled
the
portraits
of
the
Abbe
Delille
.
His
coquetry
consisted
in
*NL*
drinking
with
the
carters
.
No
one
had
ever
succeeded
in
rendering
him
*NL*
drunk
.
He
smoked
a
big
pipe
.
He
wore
a
blouse
,
and
under
his
blouse
an
*NL*
old
black
coat
.
He
made
pretensions
to
literature
and
to
materialism
.
*NL*
There
were
certain
names
which
he
often
pronounced
to
support
whatever
*NL*
things
he
might
be
saying
,
--
Voltaire
,
Raynal
,
Parny
,
and
,
singularly
*NL*
enough
,
Saint
Augustine
.
He
declared
that
he
had
``
a
system
.
''
In
*NL*
addition
,
he
was
a
great
swindler
.
A
filousophe
-LSB-
philosophe
-RSB-
,
a
*NL*
scientific
thief
.
The
species
does
exist
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
he
*NL*
pretended
to
have
served
in
the
army
;
he
was
in
the
habit
of
relating
*NL*
with
exuberance
,
how
,
being
a
sergeant
in
the
6th
or
the
9th
light
*NL*
something
or
other
,
at
Waterloo
,
he
had
alone
,
and
in
the
presence
of
a
*NL*
squadron
of
death-dealing
hussars
,
covered
with
his
body
and
saved
*NL*
from
death
,
in
the
midst
of
the
grape-shot
,
``
a
general
,
who
had
been
*NL*
dangerously
wounded
.
''
Thence
arose
for
his
wall
the
flaring
sign
,
and
*NL*
for
his
inn
the
name
which
it
bore
in
the
neighborhood
,
of
``
the
cabaret
*NL*
of
the
Sergeant
of
Waterloo
.
''
He
was
a
liberal
,
a
classic
,
and
a
*NL*
Bonapartist
.
He
had
subscribed
for
the
Champ
d'Asile
.
It
was
said
in
the
*NL*
village
that
he
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
believe
that
he
had
simply
studied
in
Holland
for
an
inn-keeper
.
This
*NL*
rascal
of
composite
order
was
,
in
all
probability
,
some
Fleming
from
*NL*
Lille
,
in
Flanders
,
a
Frenchman
in
Paris
,
a
Belgian
at
Brussels
,
being
*NL*
comfortably
astride
of
both
frontiers
.
As
for
his
prowess
at
Waterloo
,
*NL*
the
reader
is
already
acquainted
with
that
.
It
will
be
perceived
that
*NL*
he
exaggerated
it
a
trifle
.
Ebb
and
flow
,
wandering
,
adventure
,
was
*NL*
the
leven
of
his
existence
;
a
tattered
conscience
entails
a
fragmentary
*NL*
life
,
and
,
apparently
at
the
stormy
epoch
of
June
18
,
1815
,
Thenardier
*NL*
belonged
to
that
variety
of
marauding
sutlers
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
*NL*
beating
about
the
country
,
selling
to
some
,
stealing
from
others
,
and
*NL*
travelling
like
a
family
man
,
with
wife
and
children
,
in
a
rickety
*NL*
cart
,
in
the
rear
of
troops
on
the
march
,
with
an
instinct
for
always
*NL*
attaching
himself
to
the
victorious
army
.
This
campaign
ended
,
and
*NL*
having
,
as
he
said
,
``
some
quibus
,
''
he
had
come
to
Montfermeil
and
set
up
*NL*
an
inn
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
quibus
,
composed
of
purses
and
watches
,
of
gold
rings
and
silver
*NL*
crosses
,
gathered
in
harvest-time
in
furrows
sown
with
corpses
,
did
*NL*
not
amount
to
a
large
total
,
and
did
not
carry
this
sutler
turned
*NL*
eating-house-keeper
very
far
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
had
that
peculiar
rectilinear
something
about
his
gestures
*NL*
which
,
accompanied
by
an
oath
,
recalls
the
barracks
,
and
by
a
sign
*NL*
of
the
cross
,
the
seminary
.
He
was
a
fine
talker
.
He
allowed
it
to
be
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
an
educated
man
.
Nevertheless
,
the
schoolmaster
had
*NL*
noticed
that
he
pronounced
improperly
.
-LSB-

*NL*
*NL*
He
composed

in

but
*NL*
practised
eyes
sometimes
spied
out
orthographical
errors
in
it
.
*NL*
Thenardier
was
cunning
,
greedy
,
slothful
,
and
clever
.
He
did
not
disdain
*NL*
his
servants
,
which
caused
his
wife
to
dispense
with
them
.
This
giantess
*NL*
was
jealous
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
that
thin
and
yellow
little
man
must
*NL*
be
an
object
coveted
by
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
who
was
,
above
all
,
an
astute
and
well-balanced
man
,
was
a
*NL*
scamp
of
a
temperate
sort
.
This
is
the
worst
species
;
hypocrisy
enters
*NL*
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
not
that
Thenardier
was
not
,
on
occasion
,
capable
of
wrath
to
*NL*
quite
the
same
degree
as
his
wife
;
but
this
was
very
rare
,
and
at
such
*NL*
times
,
since
he
was
enraged
with
the
human
race
in
general
,
as
he
bore
*NL*
within
him
a
deep
furnace
of
hatred
.
And
since
he
was
one
of
those
*NL*
people
who
are
continually
avenging
their
wrongs
,
who
accuse
everything
*NL*
that
passes
before
them
of
everything
which
has
befallen
them
,
and
who
*NL*
are
always
ready
to
cast
upon
the
first
person
who
comes
to
hand
,
as
a
*NL*
legitimate
grievance
,
the
sum
total
of
the
deceptions
,
the
bankruptcies
,
*NL*
and
the
calamities
of
their
lives
,
--
when
all
this
leaven
was
stirred
up
*NL*
in
him
and
boiled
forth
from
his
mouth
and
eyes
,
he
was
terrible
.
Woe
to
*NL*
the
person
who
came
under
his
wrath
at
such
a
time
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
his
other
qualities
,
Thenardier
was
attentive
and
*NL*
penetrating
,
silent
or
talkative
,
according
to
circumstances
,
and
always
*NL*
highly
intelligent
.
He
had
something
of
the
look
of
sailors
,
who
are
*NL*
accustomed
to
screw
up
their
eyes
to
gaze
through
marine
glasses
.
*NL*
Thenardier
was
a
statesman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
new-comer
who
entered
the
tavern
said
,
on
catching
sight
of
Madame
*NL*
Thenardier
,
``
There
is
the
master
of
the
house
.
''
A
mistake
.
She
was
not
*NL*
even
the
mistress
.
The
husband
was
both
master
and
mistress
.
She
worked
;
*NL*
he
created
.
He
directed
everything
by
a
sort
of
invisible
and
constant
*NL*
magnetic
action
.
A
word
was
sufficient
for
him
,
sometimes
a
sign
;
the
*NL*
mastodon
obeyed
.
Thenardier
was
a
sort
of
special
and
sovereign
being
in
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
's
eyes
,
though
she
did
not
thoroughly
realize
it
.
*NL*
She
was
possessed
of
virtues
after
her
own
kind
;
if
she
had
ever
had
a
*NL*
disagreement
as
to
any
detail
with
``
Monsieur
Thenardier
,
''
--
which
was
*NL*
an
inadmissible
hypothesis
,
by
the
way
,
--
she
would
not
have
blamed
*NL*
her
husband
in
public
on
any
subject
whatever
.
She
would
never
have
*NL*
committed
``
before
strangers
''
that
mistake
so
often
committed
by
women
,
*NL*
and
which
is
called
in
parliamentary
language
,
``
exposing
the
crown
.
''
*NL*
Although
their
concord
had
only
evil
as
its
result
,
there
was
*NL*
contemplation
in
Madame
Thenardier
's
submission
to
her
husband
.
That
*NL*
mountain
of
noise
and
of
flesh
moved
under
the
little
finger
of
that
*NL*
frail
despot
.
Viewed
on
its
dwarfed
and
grotesque
side
,
this
was
that
*NL*
grand
and
universal
thing
,
the
adoration
of
mind
by
matter
;
for
certain
*NL*
ugly
features
have
a
cause
in
the
very
depths
of
eternal
beauty
.
There
*NL*
was
an
unknown
quantity
about
Thenardier
;
hence
the
absolute
empire
*NL*
of
the
man
over
that
woman
.
At
certain
moments
she
beheld
him
like
a
*NL*
lighted
candle
;
at
others
she
felt
him
like
a
claw
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
was
a
formidable
creature
who
loved
no
one
except
her
*NL*
children
,
and
who
did
not
fear
any
one
except
her
husband
.
She
was
a
*NL*
mother
because
she
was
mammiferous
.
But
her
maternity
stopped
short
with
*NL*
her
daughters
,
and
,
as
we
shall
see
,
did
not
extend
to
boys
.
The
man
had
*NL*
but
one
thought
,
--
how
to
enrich
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
succeed
in
this
.
A
theatre
worthy
of
this
great
talent
was
*NL*
lacking
.
Thenardier
was
ruining
himself
at
Montfermeil
,
if
ruin
is
*NL*
possible
to
zero
;
in
Switzerland
or
in
the
Pyrenees
this
penniless
scamp
*NL*
would
have
become
a
millionaire
;
but
an
inn-keeper
must
browse
where
*NL*
fate
has
hitched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
understood
that
the
word
inn-keeper
is
here
employed
in
a
*NL*
restricted
sense
,
and
does
not
extend
to
an
entire
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
same
year
,
1823
,
Thenardier
was
burdened
with
about
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
francs
'
worth
of
petty
debts
,
and
this
rendered
him
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
may
have
been
the
obstinate
injustice
of
destiny
in
this
case
,
*NL*
Thenardier
was
one
of
those
men
who
understand
best
,
with
the
most
*NL*
profundity
and
in
the
most
modern
fashion
,
that
thing
which
is
a
virtue
*NL*
among
barbarous
peoples
and
an
object
of
merchandise
among
civilized
*NL*
peoples
,
--
hospitality
.
Besides
,
he
was
an
admirable
poacher
,
and
quoted
*NL*
for
his
skill
in
shooting
.
He
had
a
certain
cold
and
tranquil
laugh
,
*NL*
which
was
particularly
dangerous
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
theories
as
a
landlord
sometimes
burst
forth
in
lightning
flashes
.
*NL*
He
had
professional
aphorisms
,
which
he
inserted
into
his
wife
's
mind
.
*NL*
``
The
duty
of
the
inn-keeper
,
''
he
said
to
her
one
day
,
violently
,
and
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
,
``
is
to
sell
to
the
first
comer
,
stews
,
repose
,
light
,
fire
,
*NL*
dirty
sheets
,
a
servant
,
lice
,
and
a
smile
;
to
stop
passers-by
,
to
empty
*NL*
small
purses
,
and
to
honestly
lighten
heavy
ones
;
to
shelter
travelling
*NL*
families
respectfully
:
to
shave
the
man
,
to
pluck
the
woman
,
to
pick
*NL*
the
child
clean
;
to
quote
the
window
open
,
the
window
shut
,
the
*NL*
chimney-corner
,
the
arm-chair
,
the
chair
,
the
ottoman
,
the
stool
,
the
*NL*
feather-bed
,
the
mattress
and
the
truss
of
straw
;
to
know
how
much
*NL*
the
shadow
uses
up
the
mirror
,
and
to
put
a
price
on
it
;
and
,
by
five
*NL*
hundred
thousand
devils
,
to
make
the
traveller
pay
for
everything
,
even
*NL*
for
the
flies
which
his
dog
eats
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
and
this
woman
were
ruse
and
rage
wedded
--
a
hideous
and
*NL*
terrible
team
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
husband
pondered
and
combined
,
Madame
Thenardier
thought
not
*NL*
of
absent
creditors
,
took
no
heed
of
yesterday
nor
of
to-morrow
,
and
*NL*
lived
in
a
fit
of
anger
,
all
in
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
these
two
beings
.
Cosette
was
between
them
,
subjected
to
their
*NL*
double
pressure
,
like
a
creature
who
is
at
the
same
time
being
ground
up
*NL*
in
a
mill
and
pulled
to
pieces
with
pincers
.
The
man
and
the
woman
each
*NL*
had
a
different
method
:
Cosette
was
overwhelmed
with
blows
--
this
was
the
*NL*
woman
's
;
she
went
barefooted
in
winter
--
that
was
the
man
's
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
ran
up
stairs
and
down
,
washed
,
swept
,
rubbed
,
dusted
,
ran
,
*NL*
fluttered
about
,
panted
,
moved
heavy
articles
,
and
weak
as
she
was
,
*NL*
did
the
coarse
work
.
There
was
no
mercy
for
her
;
a
fierce
mistress
and
*NL*
venomous
master
.
The
Thenardier
hostelry
was
like
a
spider
's
web
,
in
*NL*
which
Cosette
had
been
caught
,
and
where
she
lay
trembling
.
The
ideal
*NL*
of
oppression
was
realized
by
this
sinister
household
.
It
was
something
*NL*
like
the
fly
serving
the
spiders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
child
passively
held
her
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
takes
place
within
these
souls
when
they
have
but
just
quitted
God
,
*NL*
find
themselves
thus
,
at
the
very
dawn
of
life
,
very
small
and
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
men
all
naked
!

CHAPTER
III
--
MEN
MUST
HAVE
WINE
,
AND
HORSES
MUST
HAVE
WATER
*NL*
*NL*
Four
new
travellers
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
meditating
sadly
;
for
,
although
she
was
only
eight
years
*NL*
old
,
she
had
already
suffered
so
much
that
she
reflected
with
the
*NL*
lugubrious
air
of
an
old
woman
.
Her
eye
was
black
in
consequence
of
a
*NL*
blow
from
Madame
Thenardier
's
fist
,
which
caused
the
latter
to
remark
*NL*
from
time
to
time
,
``
How
ugly
she
is
with
her
fist-blow
on
her
eye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
thinking
that
it
was
dark
,
very
dark
,
that
the
pitchers
and
*NL*
caraffes
in
the
chambers
of
the
travellers
who
had
arrived
must
have
*NL*
been
filled
and
that
there
was
no
more
water
in
the
cistern
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
somewhat
reassured
because
no
one
in
the
Thenardier
*NL*
establishment
drank
much
water
.
Thirsty
people
were
never
lacking
there
;
*NL*
but
their
thirst
was
of
the
sort
which
applies
to
the
jug
rather
than
to
*NL*
the
pitcher
.
Any
one
who
had
asked
for
a
glass
of
water
among
all
those
*NL*
glasses
of
wine
would
have
appeared
a
savage
to
all
these
men
.
But
there
*NL*
came
a
moment
when
the
child
trembled
;
Madame
Thenardier
raised
the
*NL*
cover
of
a
stew-pan
which
was
boiling
on
the
stove
,
then
seized
a
glass
*NL*
and
briskly
approached
the
cistern
.
She
turned
the
faucet
;
the
child
*NL*
had
raised
her
head
and
was
following
all
the
woman
's
movements
.
A
thin
*NL*
stream
of
water
trickled
from
the
faucet
,
and
half
filled
the
glass
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
she
,
``
there
is
no
more
water
!
''
A
momentary
silence
ensued
.
*NL*
The
child
did
not
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
resumed
Madame
Thenardier
,
examining
the
half-filled
glass
,
``
this
*NL*
will
be
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
applied
herself
to
her
work
once
more
,
but
for
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
she
felt
her
heart
leaping
in
her
bosom
like
a
big
snow-flake
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
counted
the
minutes
that
passed
in
this
manner
,
and
wished
it
were
*NL*
the
next
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
one
of
the
drinkers
looked
into
the
street
,
and
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
It
's
as
black
as
an
oven
!
''
or
,
``
One
must
needs
be
a
cat
*NL*
to
go
about
the
streets
without
a
lantern
at
this
hour
!
''
And
Cosette
*NL*
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
one
of
the
pedlers
who
lodged
in
the
hostelry
entered
,
and
*NL*
said
in
a
harsh
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
horse
has
not
been
watered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
has
,
''
said
Madame
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
it
has
not
,
''
retorted
the
pedler
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
emerged
from
under
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
sir
!
''
said
she
,
``
the
horse
has
had
a
drink
;
he
drank
out
of
a
*NL*
bucket
,
a
whole
bucketful
,
and
it
was
I
who
took
the
water
to
him
,
and
I
*NL*
spoke
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
true
;
Cosette
lied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
brat
as
big
as
my
fist
who
tells
lies
as
big
as
the
house
,
''
*NL*
exclaimed
the
pedler
.
``
I
tell
you
that
he
has
not
been
watered
,
you
*NL*
little
jade
!
He
has
a
way
of
blowing
when
he
has
had
no
water
,
which
I
*NL*
know
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
persisted
,
and
added
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
with
anguish
,
*NL*
and
which
was
hardly
audible
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
drank
heartily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
the
pedler
,
in
a
rage
,
``
this
wo
n't
do
at
all
,
let
my
horse
*NL*
be
watered
,
and
let
that
be
the
end
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
crept
under
the
table
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
truth
,
that
is
fair
!
''
said
Madame
Thenardier
,
``
if
the
beast
has
not
*NL*
been
watered
,
it
must
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
glancing
about
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
!
Where
's
that
other
beast
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bent
down
and
discovered
Cosette
cowering
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
table
,
almost
under
the
drinkers
'
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
?
''
shrieked
Madame
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
crawled
out
of
the
sort
of
hole
in
which
she
had
hidden
herself
.
*NL*
The
Thenardier
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Dog-lack-name
,
go
and
water
that
horse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Madame
,
''
said
Cosette
,
feebly
,
``
there
is
no
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
threw
the
street
door
wide
open
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
go
and
get
some
,
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
dropped
her
head
,
and
went
for
an
empty
bucket
which
stood
near
*NL*
the
chimney-corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
bucket
was
bigger
than
she
was
,
and
the
child
could
have
set
down
*NL*
in
it
at
her
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
returned
to
her
stove
,
and
tasted
what
was
in
the
*NL*
stewpan
,
with
a
wooden
spoon
,
grumbling
the
while
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
plenty
in
the
spring
.
There
never
was
such
a
malicious
creature
*NL*
as
that
.
I
think
I
should
have
done
better
to
strain
my
onions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
rummaged
in
a
drawer
which
contained
sous
,
pepper
,
and
*NL*
shallots
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
Mam
`
selle
Toad
,
''
she
added
,
``
on
your
way
back
,
you
will
get
a
*NL*
big

CHAPTER

--
ENTRANCE
ON
THE
SCENE
OF
A
DOLL
*NL*
*NL*
The
line
of
open-air
booths
starting
at
the
church
,
extended
,
as
the
*NL*
reader
will
remember
,
as
far
as
the
hostelry
of
the
Thenardiers
.
These
*NL*
booths
were
all
illuminated
,
because
the
citizens
would
soon
pass
on
*NL*
their
way
to
the
midnight
mass
,
with
candles
burning
in
paper
funnels
,
*NL*
which
,
as
the
schoolmaster
,
then
seated
at
the
table
at
the
Thenardiers
'
*NL*
observed
,
produced
``
a
magical
effect
.
''
In
compensation
,
not
a
star
was
*NL*
visible
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
of
these
stalls
,
established
precisely
opposite
the
*NL*
Thenardiers
'
door
,
was
a
toy-shop
all
glittering
with
tinsel
,
glass
,
*NL*
and
magnificent
objects
of
tin
.
In
the
first
row
,
and
far
forwards
,
the
*NL*
merchant
had
placed
on
a
background
of
white
napkins
,
an
immense
doll
,
*NL*
nearly
two
feet
high
,
who
was
dressed
in
a
robe
of
pink
crepe
,
with
gold
*NL*
wheat-ears
on
her
head
,
which
had
real
hair
and
enamel
eyes
.
All
that
*NL*
day
,
this
marvel
had
been
displayed
to
the
wonderment
of
all
passers-by
*NL*
under
ten
years
of
age
,
without
a
mother
being
found
in
Montfermeil
*NL*
sufficiently
rich
or
sufficiently
extravagant
to
give
it
to
her
child
.
*NL*
Eponine
and
Azelma
had
passed
hours
in
contemplating
it
,
and
Cosette
*NL*
herself
had
ventured
to
cast
a
glance
at
it
,
on
the
sly
,
it
is
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Cosette
emerged
,
bucket
in
hand
,
melancholy
and
*NL*
overcome
as
she
was
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
lifting
her
eyes
to
*NL*
that
wonderful
doll
,
towards
the
lady
,
as
she
called
it
.
The
poor
child
*NL*
paused
in
amazement
.
She
had
not
yet
beheld
that
doll
close
to
.
The
*NL*
whole
shop
seemed
a
palace
to
her
:
the
doll
was
not
a
doll
;
it
was
a
*NL*
vision
.
It
was
joy
,
splendor
,
riches
,
happiness
,
which
appeared
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
chimerical
halo
to
that
unhappy
little
being
so
profoundly
*NL*
engulfed
in
gloomy
and
chilly
misery
.
With
the
sad
and
innocent
sagacity
*NL*
of
childhood
,
Cosette
measured
the
abyss
which
separated
her
from
*NL*
that
doll
.
She
said
to
herself
that
one
must
be
a
queen
,
or
at
least
a
*NL*
princess
,
to
have
a
``
thing
''
like
that
.
She
gazed
at
that
beautiful
pink
*NL*
dress
,
that
beautiful
smooth
hair
,
and
she
thought
,
``
How
happy
that
doll
*NL*
must
be
!
''
She
could
not
take
her
eyes
from
that
fantastic
stall
.
The
*NL*
more
she
looked
,
the
more
dazzled
she
grew
.
She
thought
she
was
gazing
*NL*
at
paradise
.
There
were
other
dolls
behind
the
large
one
,
which
seemed
*NL*
to
her
to
be
fairies
and
genii
.
The
merchant
,
who
was
pacing
back
and
*NL*
forth
in
front
of
his
shop
,
produced
on
her
somewhat
the
effect
of
being
*NL*
the
Eternal
Father
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
adoration
she
forgot
everything
,
even
the
errand
with
which
she
*NL*
was
charged
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
Thenardier
's
coarse
voice
recalled
her
to
reality
:
*NL*
``
What
,
you
silly
jade
!
you
have
not
gone
?
Wait
!
I
'll
give
it
to
you
!
I
*NL*
want
to
know
what
you
are
doing
there
!
Get
along
,
you
little
monster
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
had
cast
a
glance
into
the
street
,
and
had
caught
sight
*NL*
of
Cosette
in
her
ecstasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
fled
,
dragging
her
pail
,
and
taking
the
longest
strides
of
which
*NL*
she
was
capable
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
LITTLE
ONE
ALL
ALONE
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Thenardier
hostelry
was
in
that
part
of
the
village
which
is
*NL*
near
the
church
,
it
was
to
the
spring
in
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Chelles
that
Cosette
was
obliged
to
go
for
her
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
glance
at
the
display
of
a
single
other
merchant
.
So
long
*NL*
as
she
was
in
Boulanger
Lane
and
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
church
,
the
*NL*
lighted
stalls
illuminated
the
road
;
but
soon
the
last
light
from
the
*NL*
last
stall
vanished
.
The
poor
child
found
herself
in
the
dark
.
She
*NL*
plunged
into
it
.
Only
,
as
a
certain
emotion
overcame
her
,
she
made
as
*NL*
much
motion
as
possible
with
the
handle
of
the
bucket
as
she
walked
*NL*
along
.
This
made
a
noise
which
afforded
her
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
further
she
went
,
the
denser
the
darkness
became
.
There
was
no
one
*NL*
in
the
streets
.
However
,
she
did
encounter
a
woman
,
who
turned
around
*NL*
on
seeing
her
,
and
stood
still
,
muttering
between
her
teeth
:
``
Where
can
*NL*
that
child
be
going
?
Is
it
a
werewolf
child
?
''
Then
the
woman
recognized
*NL*
Cosette
.
``
Well
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
's
the
Lark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
Cosette
traversed
the
labyrinth
of
tortuous
and
deserted
*NL*
streets
which
terminate
in
the
village
of
Montfermeil
on
the
side
of
*NL*
Chelles
.
So
long
as
she
had
the
houses
or
even
the
walls
only
on
both
*NL*
sides
of
her
path
,
she
proceeded
with
tolerable
boldness
.
From
time
*NL*
to
time
she
caught
the
flicker
of
a
candle
through
the
crack
of
a
*NL*
shutter
--
this
was
light
and
life
;
there
were
people
there
,
and
it
*NL*
reassured
her
.
But
in
proportion
as
she
advanced
,
her
pace
slackened
*NL*
mechanically
,
as
it
were
.
When
she
had
passed
the
corner
of
the
last
*NL*
house
,
Cosette
paused
.
It
had
been
hard
to
advance
further
than
the
last
*NL*
stall
;
it
became
impossible
to
proceed
further
than
the
last
house
.
She
*NL*
set
her
bucket
on
the
ground
,
thrust
her
hand
into
her
hair
,
and
*NL*
began
slowly
to
scratch
her
head
,
--
a
gesture
peculiar
to
children
when
*NL*
terrified
and
undecided
what
to
do
.
It
was
no
longer
Montfermeil
;
it
*NL*
was
the
open
fields
.
Black
and
desert
space
was
before
her
.
She
gazed
in
*NL*
despair
at
that
darkness
,
where
there
was
no
longer
any
one
,
where
there
*NL*
were
beasts
,
where
there
were
spectres
,
possibly
.
She
took
a
good
*NL*
look
,
and
heard
the
beasts
walking
on
the
grass
,
and
she
distinctly
saw
*NL*
spectres
moving
in
the
trees
.
Then
she
seized
her
bucket
again
;
fear
had
*NL*
lent
her
audacity
.
``
Bah
!
''
said
she
;
``
I
will
tell
him
that
there
was
no
*NL*
more
water
!
''
And
she
resolutely
re-entered
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
she
gone
a
hundred
paces
when
she
paused
and
began
to
scratch
*NL*
her
head
again
.
Now
it
was
the
Thenardier
who
appeared
to
her
,
with
her
*NL*
hideous
,
hyena
mouth
,
and
wrath
flashing
in
her
eyes
.
The
child
cast
a
*NL*
melancholy
glance
before
her
and
behind
her
.
What
was
she
to
do
?
What
*NL*
was
to
become
of
her
?
Where
was
she
to
go
?
In
front
of
her
was
the
*NL*
spectre
of
the
Thenardier
;
behind
her
all
the
phantoms
of
the
night
*NL*
and
of
the
forest
.
It
was
before
the
Thenardier
that
she
recoiled
.
She
*NL*
resumed
her
path
to
the
spring
,
and
began
to
run
.
She
emerged
from
*NL*
the
village
,
she
entered
the
forest
at
a
run
,
no
longer
looking
at
or
*NL*
listening
to
anything
.
She
only
paused
in
her
course
when
her
breath
*NL*
failed
her
;
but
she
did
not
halt
in
her
advance
.
She
went
straight
*NL*
before
her
in
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
ran
she
felt
like
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nocturnal
quivering
of
the
forest
surrounded
her
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
thought
,
she
no
longer
saw
.
The
immensity
of
night
was
*NL*
facing
this
tiny
creature
.
On
the
one
hand
,
all
shadow
;
on
the
other
,
an
*NL*
atom
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
seven
or
eight
minutes
'
walk
from
the
edge
of
the
woods
to
*NL*
the
spring
.
Cosette
knew
the
way
,
through
having
gone
over
it
many
times
*NL*
in
daylight
.
Strange
to
say
,
she
did
not
get
lost
.
A
remnant
of
instinct
*NL*
guided
her
vaguely
.
But
she
did
not
turn
her
eyes
either
to
right
or
to
*NL*
left
,
for
fear
of
seeing
things
in
the
branches
and
in
the
brushwood
.
In
*NL*
this
manner
she
reached
the
spring
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
narrow
,
natural
basin
,
hollowed
out
by
the
water
in
a
clayey
*NL*
soil
,
about
two
feet
deep
,
surrounded
with
moss
and
with
those
tall
,
*NL*
crimped
grasses
which
are
called
Henry
IV
.
's
frills
,
and
paved
with
*NL*
several
large
stones
.
A
brook
ran
out
of
it
,
with
a
tranquil
little
*NL*
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
did
not
take
time
to
breathe
.
It
was
very
dark
,
but
she
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
coming
to
this
spring
.
She
felt
with
her
left
hand
in
the
*NL*
dark
for
a
young
oak
which
leaned
over
the
spring
,
and
which
usually
*NL*
served
to
support
her
,
found
one
of
its
branches
,
clung
to
it
,
bent
*NL*
down
,
and
plunged
the
bucket
in
the
water
.
She
was
in
a
state
of
such
*NL*
violent
excitement
that
her
strength
was
trebled
.
While
thus
bent
over
,
*NL*
she
did
not
notice
that
the
pocket
of
her
apron
had
emptied
itself
into
*NL*
the
spring
.
The
fifteen-sou
piece
fell
into
the
water
.
Cosette
neither
*NL*
saw
nor
heard
it
fall
.
She
drew
out
the
bucket
nearly
full
,
and
set
it
*NL*
on
the
grass
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
she
perceived
that
she
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
.
She
would
*NL*
have
liked
to
set
out
again
at
once
,
but
the
effort
required
to
fill
the
*NL*
bucket
had
been
such
that
she
found
it
impossible
to
take
a
step
.
She
*NL*
was
forced
to
sit
down
.
She
dropped
on
the
grass
,
and
remained
crouching
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shut
her
eyes
;
then
she
opened
them
again
,
without
knowing
why
,
but
*NL*
because
she
could
not
do
otherwise
.
The
agitated
water
in
the
bucket
*NL*
beside
her
was
describing
circles
which
resembled
tin
serpents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Overhead
the
sky
was
covered
with
vast
black
clouds
,
which
were
like
*NL*
masses
of
smoke
.
The
tragic
mask
of
shadow
seemed
to
bend
vaguely
over
*NL*
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jupiter
was
setting
in
the
depths
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
stared
with
bewildered
eyes
at
this
great
star
,
with
which
she
*NL*
was
unfamiliar
,
and
which
terrified
her
.
The
planet
was
,
in
fact
,
very
*NL*
near
the
horizon
and
was
traversing
a
dense
layer
of
mist
which
imparted
*NL*
to
it
a
horrible
ruddy
hue
.
The
mist
,
gloomily
empurpled
,
magnified
the
*NL*
star
.
One
would
have
called
it
a
luminous
wound
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cold
wind
was
blowing
from
the
plain
.
The
forest
was
dark
,
not
a
leaf
*NL*
was
moving
;
there
were
none
of
the
vague
,
fresh
gleams
of
summertide
.
*NL*
Great
boughs
uplifted
themselves
in
frightful
wise
.
Slender
and
*NL*
misshapen
bushes
whistled
in
the
clearings
.
The
tall
grasses
undulated
*NL*
like
eels
under
the
north
wind
.
The
nettles
seemed
to
twist
long
arms
*NL*
furnished
with
claws
in
search
of
prey
.
Some
bits
of
dry
heather
,
tossed
*NL*
by
the
breeze
,
flew
rapidly
by
,
and
had
the
air
of
fleeing
in
terror
*NL*
before
something
which
was
coming
after
.
On
all
sides
there
were
*NL*
lugubrious
stretches
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
was
bewildering
.
Man
requires
light
.
Whoever
buries
himself
*NL*
in
the
opposite
of
day
feels
his
heart
contract
.
When
the
eye
sees
*NL*
black
,
the
heart
sees
trouble
.
In
an
eclipse
in
the
night
,
in
the
sooty
*NL*
opacity
,
there
is
anxiety
even
for
the
stoutest
of
hearts
.
No
one
walks
*NL*
alone
in
the
forest
at
night
without
trembling
.
Shadows
and
trees
--
two
*NL*
formidable
densities
.
A
chimerical
reality
appears
in
the
indistinct
*NL*
depths
.
The
inconceivable
is
outlined
a
few
paces
distant
from
you
with
*NL*
a
spectral
clearness
.
One
beholds
floating
,
either
in
space
or
in
one
's
*NL*
own
brain
,
one
knows
not
what
vague
and
intangible
thing
,
like
the
*NL*
dreams
of
sleeping
flowers
.
There
are
fierce
attitudes
on
the
horizon
.
*NL*
One
inhales
the
effluvia
of
the
great
black
void
.
One
is
afraid
to
*NL*
glance
behind
him
,
yet
desirous
of
doing
so
.
The
cavities
of
night
,
*NL*
things
grown
haggard
,
taciturn
profiles
which
vanish
when
one
advances
,
*NL*
obscure
dishevelments
,
irritated
tufts
,
livid
pools
,
the
lugubrious
*NL*
reflected
in
the
funereal
,
the
sepulchral
immensity
of
silence
,
unknown
*NL*
but
possible
beings
,
bendings
of
mysterious
branches
,
alarming
torsos
of
*NL*
trees
,
long
handfuls
of
quivering
plants
,
--
against
all
this
one
has
no
*NL*
protection
.
There
is
no
hardihood
which
does
not
shudder
and
which
does
*NL*
not
feel
the
vicinity
of
anguish
.
One
is
conscious
of
something
hideous
,
*NL*
as
though
one
's
soul
were
becoming
amalgamated
with
the
darkness
.
This
*NL*
penetration
of
the
shadows
is
indescribably
sinister
in
the
case
of
a
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forests
are
apocalypses
,
and
the
beating
of
the
wings
of
a
tiny
soul
*NL*
produces
a
sound
of
agony
beneath
their
monstrous
vault
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
understanding
her
sensations
,
Cosette
was
conscious
that
she
was
*NL*
seized
upon
by
that
black
enormity
of
nature
;
it
was
no
longer
terror
*NL*
alone
which
was
gaining
possession
of
her
;
it
was
something
more
*NL*
terrible
even
than
terror
;
she
shivered
.
There
are
no
words
to
express
*NL*
the
strangeness
of
that
shiver
which
chilled
her
to
the
very
bottom
of
*NL*
her
heart
;
her
eye
grew
wild
;
she
thought
she
felt
that
she
should
not
*NL*
be
able
to
refrain
from
returning
there
at
the
same
hour
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
by
a
sort
of
instinct
,
she
began
to
count
aloud
,
one
,
two
,
three
,
*NL*
four
,
and
so
on
up
to
ten
,
in
order
to
escape
from
that
singular
state
*NL*
which
she
did
not
understand
,
but
which
terrified
her
,
and
,
when
she
had
*NL*
finished
,
she
began
again
;
this
restored
her
to
a
true
perception
of
*NL*
the
things
about
her
.
Her
hands
,
which
she
had
wet
in
drawing
the
water
,
*NL*
felt
cold
;
she
rose
;
her
terror
,
a
natural
and
unconquerable
terror
,
had
*NL*
returned
:
she
had
but
one
thought
now
,
--
to
flee
at
full
speed
through
*NL*
the
forest
,
across
the
fields
to
the
houses
,
to
the
windows
,
to
the
*NL*
lighted
candles
.
Her
glance
fell
upon
the
water
which
stood
before
her
;
*NL*
such
was
the
fright
which
the
Thenardier
inspired
in
her
,
that
she
dared
*NL*
not
flee
without
that
bucket
of
water
:
she
seized
the
handle
with
both
*NL*
hands
;
she
could
hardly
lift
the
pail
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
she
advanced
a
dozen
paces
,
but
the
bucket
was
full
;
it
*NL*
was
heavy
;
she
was
forced
to
set
it
on
the
ground
once
more
.
She
took
*NL*
breath
for
an
instant
,
then
lifted
the
handle
of
the
bucket
again
,
and
*NL*
resumed
her
march
,
proceeding
a
little
further
this
time
,
but
again
she
*NL*
was
obliged
to
pause
.
After
some
seconds
of
repose
she
set
out
again
.
*NL*
She
walked
bent
forward
,
with
drooping
head
,
like
an
old
woman
;
the
*NL*
weight
of
the
bucket
strained
and
stiffened
her
thin
arms
.
The
iron
*NL*
handle
completed
the
benumbing
and
freezing
of
her
wet
and
tiny
hands
;
*NL*
she
was
forced
to
halt
from
time
to
time
,
and
each
time
that
she
did
so
,
*NL*
the
cold
water
which
splashed
from
the
pail
fell
on
her
bare
legs
.
This
*NL*
took
place
in
the
depths
of
a
forest
,
at
night
,
in
winter
,
far
from
all
*NL*
human
sight
;
she
was
a
child
of
eight
:
no
one
but
God
saw
that
sad
thing
*NL*
at
the
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
her
mother
,
no
doubt
,
alas
!
*NL*
*NL*
For
there
are
things
that
make
the
dead
open
their
eyes
in
their
graves
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
panted
with
a
sort
of
painful
rattle
;
sobs
contracted
her
throat
,
*NL*
but
she
dared
not
weep
,
so
afraid
was
she
of
the
Thenardier
,
even
at
a
*NL*
distance
:
it
was
her
custom
to
imagine
the
Thenardier
always
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
could
not
make
much
headway
in
that
manner
,
and
she
went
*NL*
on
very
slowly
.
In
spite
of
diminishing
the
length
of
her
stops
,
and
*NL*
of
walking
as
long
as
possible
between
them
,
she
reflected
with
anguish
*NL*
that
it
would
take
her
more
than
an
hour
to
return
to
Montfermeil
in
*NL*
this
manner
,
and
that
the
Thenardier
would
beat
her
.
This
anguish
was
*NL*
mingled
with
her
terror
at
being
alone
in
the
woods
at
night
;
she
was
*NL*
worn
out
with
fatigue
,
and
had
not
yet
emerged
from
the
forest
.
On
*NL*
arriving
near
an
old
chestnut-tree
with
which
she
was
acquainted
,
made
*NL*
a
last
halt
,
longer
than
the
rest
,
in
order
that
she
might
get
well
*NL*
rested
;
then
she
summoned
up
all
her
strength
,
picked
up
her
bucket
*NL*
again
,
and
courageously
resumed
her
march
,
but
the
poor
little
desperate
*NL*
creature
could
not
refrain
from
crying
,
``
O
my
God
!
my
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
she
suddenly
became
conscious
that
her
bucket
no
longer
*NL*
weighed
anything
at
all
:
a
hand
,
which
seemed
to
her
enormous
,
had
just
*NL*
seized
the
handle
,
and
lifted
it
vigorously
.
She
raised
her
head
.
A
*NL*
large
black
form
,
straight
and
erect
,
was
walking
beside
her
through
the
*NL*
darkness
;
it
was
a
man
who
had
come
up
behind
her
,
and
whose
approach
*NL*
she
had
not
heard
.
This
man
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
had
seized
the
*NL*
handle
of
the
bucket
which
she
was
carrying
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
instincts
for
all
the
encounters
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
was
not
afraid
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
WHICH
POSSIBLY
PROVES
BOULATRUELLE
'S
INTELLIGENCE
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
afternoon
of
that
same
Christmas
Day
,
1823
,
a
man
had
walked
*NL*
for
rather
a
long
time
in
the
most
deserted
part
of
the
Boulevard
de
*NL*
l'Hopital
in
Paris
.
This
man
had
the
air
of
a
person
who
is
seeking
*NL*
lodgings
,
and
he
seemed
to
halt
,
by
preference
,
at
the
most
modest
*NL*
houses
on
that
dilapidated
border
of
the
faubourg
Saint-Marceau
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
see
further
on
that
this
man
had
,
in
fact
,
hired
a
chamber
in
*NL*
that
isolated
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
,
in
his
attire
,
as
in
all
his
person
,
realized
the
type
of
what
*NL*
may
be
called
the
well-bred
mendicant
,
--
extreme
wretchedness
combined
*NL*
with
extreme
cleanliness
.
This
is
a
very
rare
mixture
which
inspires
*NL*
intelligent
hearts
with
that
double
respect
which
one
feels
for
the
man
*NL*
who
is
very
poor
,
and
for
the
man
who
is
very
worthy
.
He
wore
a
very
*NL*
old
and
very
well
brushed
round
hat
;
a
coarse
coat
,
worn
perfectly
*NL*
threadbare
,
of
an
ochre
yellow
,
a
color
that
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
eccentric
at
that
epoch
;
a
large
waistcoat
with
pockets
of
a
venerable
*NL*
cut
;
black
breeches
,
worn
gray
at
the
knee
,
stockings
of
black
worsted
;
*NL*
and
thick
shoes
with
copper
buckles
.
He
would
have
been
pronounced
a
*NL*
preceptor
in
some
good
family
,
returned
from
the
emigration
.
He
would
*NL*
have
been
taken
for
more
than
sixty
years
of
age
,
from
his
perfectly
*NL*
white
hair
,
his
wrinkled
brow
,
his
livid
lips
,
and
his
countenance
,
*NL*
where
everything
breathed
depression
and
weariness
of
life
.
Judging
from
*NL*
his
firm
tread
,
from
the
singular
vigor
which
stamped
all
his
movements
,
*NL*
he
would
have
hardly
been
thought
fifty
.
The
wrinkles
on
his
brow
were
*NL*
well
placed
,
and
would
have
disposed
in
his
favor
any
one
who
observed
*NL*
him
attentively
.
His
lip
contracted
with
a
strange
fold
which
seemed
*NL*
severe
,
and
which
was
humble
.
There
was
in
the
depth
of
his
glance
an
*NL*
indescribable
melancholy
serenity
.
In
his
left
hand
he
carried
a
little
*NL*
bundle
tied
up
in
a
handkerchief
;
in
his
right
he
leaned
on
a
sort
of
a
*NL*
cudgel
,
cut
from
some
hedge
.
This
stick
had
been
carefully
trimmed
,
and
*NL*
had
an
air
that
was
not
too
threatening
;
the
most
had
been
made
of
its
*NL*
knots
,
and
it
had
received
a
coral-like
head
,
made
from
red
wax
:
it
was
*NL*
a
cudgel
,
and
it
seemed
to
be
a
cane
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
but
few
passers-by
on
that
boulevard
,
particularly
in
the
*NL*
winter
.
The
man
seemed
to
avoid
them
rather
than
to
seek
them
,
but
this
*NL*
without
any
affectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
King
Louis
XVIII
.
went
nearly
every
day
to
Choisy-le-Roi
:
*NL*
it
was
one
of
his
favorite
excursions
.
Towards
two
o'clock
,
almost
*NL*
invariably
,
the
royal
carriage
and
cavalcade
was
seen
to
pass
at
full
*NL*
speed
along
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
served
in
lieu
of
a
watch
or
clock
to
the
poor
women
of
the
quarter
*NL*
who
said
,
``
It
is
two
o'clock
;
there
he
is
returning
to
the
Tuileries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
some
rushed
forward
,
and
others
drew
up
in
line
,
for
a
passing
king
*NL*
always
creates
a
tumult
;
besides
,
the
appearance
and
disappearance
of
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
produced
a
certain
effect
in
the
streets
of
Paris
.
It
was
*NL*
rapid
but
majestic
.
This
impotent
king
had
a
taste
for
a
fast
gallop
;
*NL*
as
he
was
not
able
to
walk
,
he
wished
to
run
:
that
cripple
would
gladly
*NL*
have
had
himself
drawn
by
the
lightning
.
He
passed
,
pacific
and
severe
,
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
naked
swords
.
His
massive
coach
,
all
covered
with
*NL*
gilding
,
with
great
branches
of
lilies
painted
on
the
panels
,
thundered
*NL*
noisily
along
.
There
was
hardly
time
to
cast
a
glance
upon
it
.
In
the
*NL*
rear
angle
on
the
right
there
was
visible
on
tufted
cushions
of
white
*NL*
satin
a
large
,
firm
,
and
ruddy
face
,
a
brow
freshly
powdered
a
l'oiseau
*NL*
royal
,
a
proud
,
hard
,
crafty
eye
,
the
smile
of
an
educated
man
,
two
*NL*
great
epaulets
with
bullion
fringe
floating
over
a
bourgeois
coat
,
the
*NL*
Golden
Fleece
,
the
cross
of
Saint
Louis
,
the
cross
of
the
Legion
of
*NL*
Honor
,
the
silver
plaque
of
the
Saint-Esprit
,
a
huge
belly
,
and
a
wide
*NL*
blue
ribbon
:
it
was
the
king
.
Outside
of
Paris
,
he
held
his
hat
decked
*NL*
with
white
ostrich
plumes
on
his
knees
enwrapped
in
high
English
*NL*
gaiters
;
when
he
re-entered
the
city
,
he
put
on
his
hat
and
saluted
*NL*
rarely
;
he
stared
coldly
at
the
people
,
and
they
returned
it
in
kind
.
*NL*
When
he
appeared
for
the
first
time
in
the
Saint-Marceau
quarter
,
*NL*
the
whole
success
which
he
produced
is
contained
in
this
remark
of
an
*NL*
inhabitant
of
the
faubourg
to
his
comrade
,
``
That
big
fellow
yonder
is
*NL*
the
government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
infallible
passage
of
the
king
at
the
same
hour
was
,
therefore
,
the
*NL*
daily
event
of
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
promenader
in
the
yellow
coat
evidently
did
not
belong
in
the
*NL*
quarter
,
and
probably
did
not
belong
in
Paris
,
for
he
was
ignorant
as
to
*NL*
this
detail
.
When
,
at
two
o'clock
,
the
royal
carriage
,
surrounded
by
a
*NL*
squadron
of
the
body-guard
all
covered
with
silver
lace
,
debouched
*NL*
on
the
boulevard
,
after
having
made
the
turn
of
the
Salpetriere
,
he
*NL*
appeared
surprised
and
almost
alarmed
.
There
was
no
one
but
himself
in
*NL*
this
cross-lane
.
He
drew
up
hastily
behind
the
corner
of
the
wall
of
an
*NL*
enclosure
,
though
this
did
not
prevent
M.
le
Duc
de
Havre
from
spying
*NL*
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
le
Duc
de
Havre
,
as
captain
of
the
guard
on
duty
that
day
,
was
seated
*NL*
in
the
carriage
,
opposite
the
king
.
He
said
to
his
Majesty
,
``
Yonder
*NL*
is
an
evil-looking
man
.
''
Members
of
the
police
,
who
were
clearing
the
*NL*
king
's
route
,
took
equal
note
of
him
:
one
of
them
received
an
order
to
*NL*
follow
him
.
But
the
man
plunged
into
the
deserted
little
streets
of
the
*NL*
faubourg
,
and
as
twilight
was
beginning
to
fall
,
the
agent
lost
trace
of
*NL*
him
,
as
is
stated
in
a
report
addressed
that
same
evening
to
M.
le
Comte
*NL*
d'Angles
,
Minister
of
State
,
Prefect
of
Police
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
had
thrown
the
agent
off
his
track
,
*NL*
he
redoubled
his
pace
,
not
without
turning
round
many
a
time
to
assure
*NL*
himself
that
he
was
not
being
followed
.
At
a
quarter-past
four
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
when
night
was
fully
come
,
he
passed
in
front
of
the
theatre
*NL*
of
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
,
where
The
Two
Convicts
was
being
played
that
*NL*
day
.
This
poster
,
illuminated
by
the
theatre
lanterns
,
struck
him
;
for
,
*NL*
although
he
was
walking
rapidly
,
he
halted
to
read
it
.
An
instant
later
*NL*
he
was
in
the
blind
alley
of
La
Planchette
,
and
he
entered
the
Plat
*NL*
d'Etain
-LSB-
the
Pewter
Platter
-RSB-
,
where
the
office
of
the
coach
for
Lagny
*NL*
was
then
situated
.
This
coach
set
out
at
half-past
four
.
The
horses
were
*NL*
harnessed
,
and
the
travellers
,
summoned
by
the
coachman
,
were
hastily
*NL*
climbing
the
lofty
iron
ladder
of
the
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
--
beside
me
on
the
box
,
''
said
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climb
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
before
setting
out
,
the
coachman
cast
a
glance
at
the
*NL*
traveller
's
shabby
dress
,
at
the
diminutive
size
of
his
bundle
,
and
made
*NL*
him
pay
his
fare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
as
far
as
Lagny
?
''
demanded
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
paid
to
Lagny
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
started
.
When
they
had
passed
the
barrier
,
the
coachman
tried
*NL*
to
enter
into
conversation
,
but
the
traveller
only
replied
in
*NL*
monosyllables
.
The
coachman
took
to
whistling
and
swearing
at
his
*NL*
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
wrapped
himself
up
in
his
cloak
.
It
was
cold
.
The
man
*NL*
did
not
appear
to
be
thinking
of
that
.
Thus
they
passed
Gournay
and
*NL*
Neuilly-sur-Marne
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
they
reached
Chelles
.
The
coachman
*NL*
drew
up
in
front
of
the
carters
'
inn
installed
in
the
ancient
buildings
*NL*
of
the
Royal
Abbey
,
to
give
his
horses
a
breathing
spell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
get
down
here
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
and
jumped
down
from
the
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
later
he
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
enter
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
coach
set
out
for
Lagny
a
few
minutes
later
,
it
did
not
*NL*
encounter
him
in
the
principal
street
of
Chelles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
turned
to
the
inside
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
he
,
``
is
a
man
who
does
not
belong
here
,
for
I
do
not
know
*NL*
him
.
He
had
not
the
air
of
owning
a
sou
,
but
he
does
not
consider
money
;
*NL*
he
pays
to
Lagny
,
and
he
goes
only
as
far
as
Chelles
.
It
is
night
;
all
*NL*
the
houses
are
shut
;
he
does
not
enter
the
inn
,
and
he
is
not
to
be
*NL*
found
.
So
he
has
dived
through
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
had
not
plunged
into
the
earth
,
but
he
had
gone
with
great
*NL*
strides
through
the
dark
,
down
the
principal
street
of
Chelles
,
then
he
*NL*
had
turned
to
the
right
before
reaching
the
church
,
into
the
cross-road
*NL*
leading
to
Montfermeil
,
like
a
person
who
was
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
country
and
had
been
there
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
this
road
rapidly
.
At
the
spot
where
it
is
intersected
by
*NL*
the
ancient
tree-bordered
road
which
runs
from
Gagny
to
Lagny
,
he
heard
*NL*
people
coming
.
He
concealed
himself
precipitately
in
a
ditch
,
and
there
*NL*
waited
until
the
passers-by
were
at
a
distance
.
The
precaution
was
*NL*
nearly
superfluous
,
however
;
for
,
as
we
have
already
said
,
it
was
a
very
*NL*
dark
December
night
.
Not
more
than
two
or
three
stars
were
visible
in
*NL*
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
at
this
point
that
the
ascent
of
the
hill
begins
.
The
man
did
not
*NL*
return
to
the
road
to
Montfermeil
;
he
struck
across
the
fields
to
the
*NL*
right
,
and
entered
the
forest
with
long
strides
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
in
the
forest
he
slackened
his
pace
,
and
began
a
careful
*NL*
examination
of
all
the
trees
,
advancing
,
step
by
step
,
as
though
seeking
*NL*
and
following
a
mysterious
road
known
to
himself
alone
.
There
came
a
*NL*
moment
when
he
appeared
to
lose
himself
,
and
he
paused
in
indecision
.
At
*NL*
last
he
arrived
,
by
dint
of
feeling
his
way
inch
by
inch
,
at
a
clearing
*NL*
where
there
was
a
great
heap
of
whitish
stones
.
He
stepped
up
briskly
to
*NL*
these
stones
,
and
examined
them
attentively
through
the
mists
of
night
,
*NL*
as
though
he
were
passing
them
in
review
.
A
large
tree
,
covered
with
*NL*
those
excrescences
which
are
the
warts
of
vegetation
,
stood
a
few
paces
*NL*
distant
from
the
pile
of
stones
.
He
went
up
to
this
tree
and
passed
*NL*
his
hand
over
the
bark
of
the
trunk
,
as
though
seeking
to
recognize
and
*NL*
count
all
the
warts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
this
tree
,
which
was
an
ash
,
there
was
a
chestnut-tree
,
*NL*
suffering
from
a
peeling
of
the
bark
,
to
which
a
band
of
zinc
had
been
*NL*
nailed
by
way
of
dressing
.
He
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
touched
this
*NL*
band
of
zinc
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
trod
about
for
awhile
on
the
ground
comprised
in
the
space
*NL*
between
the
tree
and
the
heap
of
stones
,
like
a
person
who
is
trying
to
*NL*
assure
himself
that
the
soil
has
not
recently
been
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
he
took
his
bearings
,
and
resumed
his
march
through
the
*NL*
forest
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
man
who
had
just
met
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
walked
through
the
thicket
in
the
direction
of
Montfermeil
,
he
had
*NL*
espied
that
tiny
shadow
moving
with
a
groan
,
depositing
a
burden
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
then
taking
it
up
and
setting
out
again
.
He
drew
near
,
and
*NL*
perceived
that
it
was
a
very
young
child
,
laden
with
an
enormous
bucket
*NL*
of
water
.
Then
he
approached
the
child
,
and
silently
grasped
the
handle
*NL*
of
the
bucket
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
COSETTE
SIDE
BY
SIDE
WITH
THE
STRANGER
IN
THE
DARK
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
not
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
accosted
her
.
He
spoke
in
a
voice
that
was
grave
and
almost
*NL*
bass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
what
you
are
carrying
is
very
heavy
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
raised
her
head
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
,
''
said
the
man
;
``
I
will
carry
it
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
let
go
of
the
bucket-handle
.
The
man
walked
along
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
really
is
very
heavy
,
''
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
.
Then
he
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
,
little
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
you
come
from
far
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
spring
in
the
forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
far
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
quarter
of
an
hour
's
walk
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
said
nothing
for
a
moment
;
then
he
remarked
abruptly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
no
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
answered
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
man
had
time
to
speak
again
,
she
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
.
Other
people
have
mothers
.
I
have
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
a
silence
she
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
I
never
had
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
halted
;
he
set
the
bucket
on
the
ground
,
bent
down
and
placed
*NL*
both
hands
on
the
child
's
shoulders
,
making
an
effort
to
look
at
her
and
*NL*
to
see
her
face
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
's
thin
and
sickly
face
was
vaguely
outlined
by
the
livid
light
*NL*
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
seemed
to
have
received
an
electric
shock
.
He
looked
at
her
once
*NL*
more
;
then
he
removed
his
hands
from
Cosette
's
shoulders
,
seized
the
*NL*
bucket
,
and
set
out
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
he
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
live
,
little
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Montfermeil
,
if
you
know
where
that
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
where
we
are
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
;
then
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
sent
you
at
such
an
hour
to
get
water
in
the
forest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Madame
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
resumed
,
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
,
but
*NL*
in
which
there
was
,
nevertheless
,
a
singular
tremor
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
your
Madame
Thenardier
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
my
mistress
,
''
said
the
child
.
``
She
keeps
the
inn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
inn
?
''
said
the
man
.
``
Well
,
I
am
going
to
lodge
there
to-night
.
Show
*NL*
me
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
on
the
way
there
,
''
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
walked
tolerably
fast
.
Cosette
followed
him
without
difficulty
.
*NL*
She
no
longer
felt
any
fatigue
.
From
time
to
time
she
raised
her
eyes
*NL*
towards
the
man
,
with
a
sort
of
tranquillity
and
an
indescribable
*NL*
confidence
.
She
had
never
been
taught
to
turn
to
Providence
and
to
pray
;
*NL*
nevertheless
,
she
felt
within
her
something
which
resembled
hope
and
*NL*
joy
,
and
which
mounted
towards
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
minutes
elapsed
.
The
man
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
no
servant
in
Madame
Thenardier
's
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
alone
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
pause
ensued
.
Cosette
lifted
up
her
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
there
are
two
little
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
little
girls
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ponine
and
Zelma
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
way
the
child
simplified
the
romantic
names
so
dear
to
the
*NL*
female
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
Ponine
and
Zelma
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
Madame
Thenardier
's
young
ladies
;
her
daughters
,
as
you
would
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
do
those
girls
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
the
child
,
``
they
have
beautiful
dolls
;
things
with
gold
in
*NL*
them
,
all
full
of
affairs
.
They
play
;
they
amuse
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
day
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
day
long
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
raised
her
great
eyes
,
in
which
hung
a
tear
,
which
was
not
*NL*
visible
because
of
the
darkness
,
and
replied
gently
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interval
of
silence
she
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
when
I
have
finished
my
work
and
they
let
me
,
I
amuse
*NL*
myself
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
amuse
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
best
way
I
can
.
They
let
me
alone
;
but
I
have
not
many
*NL*
playthings
.
Ponine
and
Zelma
will
not
let
me
play
with
their
dolls
.
I
*NL*
have
only
a
little
lead
sword
,
no
longer
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
held
up
her
tiny
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
will
not
cut
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
the
child
;
``
it
cuts
salad
and
the
heads
of
flies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
village
.
Cosette
guided
the
stranger
through
the
*NL*
streets
.
They
passed
the
bakeshop
,
but
Cosette
did
not
think
of
the
*NL*
bread
which
she
had
been
ordered
to
fetch
.
The
man
had
ceased
to
ply
her
*NL*
with
questions
,
and
now
preserved
a
gloomy
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
left
the
church
behind
them
,
the
man
,
on
perceiving
all
*NL*
the
open-air
booths
,
asked
Cosette
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
is
a
fair
going
on
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
it
is
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
approached
the
tavern
,
Cosette
timidly
touched
his
arm
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
my
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
quite
near
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
let
me
take
my
bucket
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Madame
sees
that
some
one
has
carried
it
for
me
,
she
will
beat
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
handed
her
the
bucket
.
An
instant
later
they
were
at
the
tavern
*NL*
door
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
UNPLEASANTNESS
OF
RECEIVING
INTO
ONE
'S
HOUSE
A
POOR
*NL*
MAN
WHO
MAY
BE
A
RICH
MAN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
could
not
refrain
from
casting
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
big
*NL*
doll
,
which
was
still
displayed
at
the
toy-merchant
's
;
then
she
knocked
.
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
The
Thenardier
appeared
with
a
candle
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
it
's
you
,
you
little
wretch
!
good
mercy
,
but
you
've
taken
your
*NL*
time
!
The
hussy
has
been
amusing
herself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
Cosette
,
trembling
all
over
,
``
here
's
a
gentleman
who
*NL*
wants
a
lodging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
speedily
replaced
her
gruff
air
by
her
amiable
grimace
,
*NL*
a
change
of
aspect
common
to
tavern-keepers
,
and
eagerly
sought
the
*NL*
new-comer
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
gentleman
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Madame
,
''
replied
the
man
,
raising
his
hand
to
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wealthy
travellers
are
not
so
polite
.
This
gesture
,
and
an
inspection
*NL*
of
the
stranger
's
costume
and
baggage
,
which
the
Thenardier
passed
in
*NL*
review
with
one
glance
,
caused
the
amiable
grimace
to
vanish
,
and
the
*NL*
gruff
mien
to
reappear
.
She
resumed
dryly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enter
,
my
good
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
good
man
''
entered
.
The
Thenardier
cast
a
second
glance
at
him
,
paid
*NL*
particular
attention
to
his
frock-coat
,
which
was
absolutely
threadbare
,
*NL*
and
to
his
hat
,
which
was
a
little
battered
,
and
,
tossing
her
head
,
*NL*
wrinkling
her
nose
,
and
screwing
up
her
eyes
,
she
consulted
her
husband
,
*NL*
who
was
still
drinking
with
the
carters
.
The
husband
replied
by
that
*NL*
imperceptible
movement
of
the
forefinger
,
which
,
backed
up
by
an
*NL*
inflation
of
the
lips
,
signifies
in
such
cases
:
A
regular
beggar
.
*NL*
Thereupon
,
the
Thenardier
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
see
here
,
my
good
man
;
I
am
very
sorry
,
but
I
have
no
room
left
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
me
where
you
like
,
''
said
the
man
;
``
in
the
attic
,
in
the
stable
.
I
*NL*
will
pay
as
though
I
occupied
a
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
sous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
sous
;
agreed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
sous
!
''
said
a
carter
,
in
a
low
tone
,
to
the
Thenardier
woman
;
*NL*
``
why
,
the
charge
is
only
twenty
sous
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
forty
in
his
case
,
''
retorted
the
Thenardier
,
in
the
same
tone
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
lodge
poor
folks
for
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
added
her
husband
,
gently
;
``
it
ruins
a
house
to
have
such
*NL*
people
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
man
,
laying
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
on
a
bench
,
*NL*
had
seated
himself
at
a
table
,
on
which
Cosette
made
haste
to
place
a
*NL*
bottle
of
wine
and
a
glass
.
The
merchant
who
had
demanded
the
bucket
of
*NL*
water
took
it
to
his
horse
himself
.
Cosette
resumed
her
place
under
the
*NL*
kitchen
table
,
and
her
knitting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
who
had
barely
moistened
his
lips
in
the
wine
which
he
had
*NL*
poured
out
for
himself
,
observed
the
child
with
peculiar
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
ugly
.
If
she
had
been
happy
,
she
might
have
been
pretty
.
We
*NL*
have
already
given
a
sketch
of
that
sombre
little
figure
.
Cosette
was
*NL*
thin
and
pale
;
she
was
nearly
eight
years
old
,
but
she
seemed
to
be
*NL*
hardly
six
.
Her
large
eyes
,
sunken
in
a
sort
of
shadow
,
were
almost
put
*NL*
out
with
weeping
.
The
corners
of
her
mouth
had
that
curve
of
habitual
*NL*
anguish
which
is
seen
in
condemned
persons
and
desperately
sick
people
.
*NL*
Her
hands
were
,
as
her
mother
had
divined
,
``
ruined
with
chilblains
.
''
The
*NL*
fire
which
illuminated
her
at
that
moment
brought
into
relief
all
the
*NL*
angles
of
her
bones
,
and
rendered
her
thinness
frightfully
apparent
.
*NL*
As
she
was
always
shivering
,
she
had
acquired
the
habit
of
pressing
her
*NL*
knees
one
against
the
other
.
Her
entire
clothing
was
but
a
rag
which
*NL*
would
have
inspired
pity
in
summer
,
and
which
inspired
horror
in
winter
.
*NL*
All
she
had
on
was
hole-ridden
linen
,
not
a
scrap
of
woollen
.
Her
skin
*NL*
was
visible
here
and
there
and
everywhere
black
and
blue
spots
could
be
*NL*
descried
,
which
marked
the
places
where
the
Thenardier
woman
had
touched
*NL*
her
.
Her
naked
legs
were
thin
and
red
.
The
hollows
in
her
neck
were
*NL*
enough
to
make
one
weep
.
This
child
's
whole
person
,
her
mien
,
her
*NL*
attitude
,
the
sound
of
her
voice
,
the
intervals
which
she
allowed
to
*NL*
elapse
between
one
word
and
the
next
,
her
glance
,
her
silence
,
her
*NL*
slightest
gesture
,
expressed
and
betrayed
one
sole
idea
,
--
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fear
was
diffused
all
over
her
;
she
was
covered
with
it
,
so
to
speak
;
*NL*
fear
drew
her
elbows
close
to
her
hips
,
withdrew
her
heels
under
her
*NL*
petticoat
,
made
her
occupy
as
little
space
as
possible
,
allowed
her
only
*NL*
the
breath
that
was
absolutely
necessary
,
and
had
become
what
might
be
*NL*
called
the
habit
of
her
body
,
admitting
of
no
possible
variation
except
*NL*
an
increase
.
In
the
depths
of
her
eyes
there
was
an
astonished
nook
*NL*
where
terror
lurked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fear
was
such
,
that
on
her
arrival
,
wet
as
she
was
,
Cosette
did
not
*NL*
dare
to
approach
the
fire
and
dry
herself
,
but
sat
silently
down
to
her
*NL*
work
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
expression
in
the
glance
of
that
child
of
eight
years
was
habitually
*NL*
so
gloomy
,
and
at
times
so
tragic
,
that
it
seemed
at
certain
moments
as
*NL*
though
she
were
on
the
verge
of
becoming
an
idiot
or
a
demon
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
stated
,
she
had
never
known
what
it
is
to
pray
;
she
had
never
*NL*
set
foot
in
a
church
.
``
Have
I
the
time
?
''
said
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
yellow
coat
never
took
his
eyes
from
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
the
Thenardier
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
where
's
that
bread
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
according
to
her
custom
whenever
the
Thenardier
uplifted
her
*NL*
voice
,
emerged
with
great
haste
from
beneath
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
completely
forgotten
the
bread
.
She
had
recourse
to
the
*NL*
expedient
of
children
who
live
in
a
constant
state
of
fear
.
She
lied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
the
baker
's
shop
was
shut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
should
have
knocked
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
knock
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
open
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
find
out
to-morrow
whether
that
is
true
,
''
said
the
Thenardier
;
*NL*
``
and
if
you
are
telling
me
a
lie
,
I
'll
lead
you
a
pretty
dance
.
In
the
*NL*
meantime
,
give
me
back
my
fifteen-sou
piece
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
plunged
her
hand
into
the
pocket
of
her
apron
,
and
turned
green
.
*NL*
The
fifteen-sou
piece
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
now
,
''
said
Madame
Thenardier
,
``
did
you
hear
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
turned
her
pocket
inside
out
;
there
was
nothing
in
it
.
What
*NL*
could
have
become
of
that
money
?
The
unhappy
little
creature
could
not
*NL*
find
a
word
to
say
.
She
was
petrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
lost
that
fifteen-sou
piece
?
''
screamed
the
Thenardier
,
*NL*
hoarsely
,
``
or
do
you
want
to
rob
me
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
she
stretched
out
her
arm
towards
the
*NL*
cat-o
'
-
nine-tails
which
hung
on
a
nail
in
the
chimney-corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
formidable
gesture
restored
to
Cosette
sufficient
strength
to
*NL*
shriek
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
,
Madame
,
Madame
!
I
will
not
do
so
any
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
took
down
the
whip
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
man
in
the
yellow
coat
had
been
fumbling
in
the
fob
*NL*
of
his
waistcoat
,
without
any
one
having
noticed
his
movements
.
Besides
,
*NL*
the
other
travellers
were
drinking
or
playing
cards
,
and
were
not
paying
*NL*
attention
to
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
contracted
herself
into
a
ball
,
with
anguish
,
within
the
angle
*NL*
of
the
chimney
,
endeavoring
to
gather
up
and
conceal
her
poor
half-nude
*NL*
limbs
.
The
Thenardier
raised
her
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
Madame
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
but
just
now
I
caught
sight
of
*NL*
something
which
had
fallen
from
this
little
one
's
apron
pocket
,
and
*NL*
rolled
aside
.
Perhaps
this
is
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
he
bent
down
and
seemed
to
be
searching
on
the
floor
*NL*
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
;
here
it
is
,
''
he
went
on
,
straightening
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
held
out
a
silver
coin
to
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
it
,
for
it
was
a
twenty-sou
piece
;
but
the
Thenardier
found
*NL*
it
to
her
advantage
.
She
put
the
coin
in
her
pocket
,
and
confined
*NL*
herself
to
casting
a
fierce
glance
at
the
child
,
accompanied
with
the
*NL*
remark
,
``
Do
n't
let
this
ever
happen
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
returned
to
what
the
Thenardier
called
``
her
kennel
,
''
and
her
*NL*
large
eyes
,
which
were
riveted
on
the
traveller
,
began
to
take
on
an
*NL*
expression
such
as
they
had
never
worn
before
.
Thus
far
it
was
only
an
*NL*
innocent
amazement
,
but
a
sort
of
stupefied
confidence
was
mingled
with
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
would
you
like
some
supper
?
''
the
Thenardier
inquired
of
the
*NL*
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
.
He
appeared
to
be
absorbed
in
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
a
man
is
that
?
''
she
muttered
between
her
teeth
.
``
He
's
some
*NL*
frightfully
poor
wretch
.
He
has
n't
a
sou
to
pay
for
a
supper
.
Will
he
*NL*
even
pay
me
for
his
lodging
?
It
's
very
lucky
,
all
the
same
,
that
it
did
*NL*
not
occur
to
him
to
steal
the
money
that
was
on
the
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
a
door
had
opened
,
and
Eponine
and
Azelma
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
two
really
pretty
little
girls
,
more
bourgeois
than
peasant
*NL*
in
looks
,
and
very
charming
;
the
one
with
shining
chestnut
tresses
,
*NL*
the
other
with
long
black
braids
hanging
down
her
back
,
both
vivacious
,
*NL*
neat
,
plump
,
rosy
,
and
healthy
,
and
a
delight
to
the
eye
.
They
were
*NL*
warmly
clad
,
but
with
so
much
maternal
art
that
the
thickness
of
the
*NL*
stuffs
did
not
detract
from
the
coquetry
of
arrangement
.
There
was
a
*NL*
hint
of
winter
,
though
the
springtime
was
not
wholly
effaced
.
Light
*NL*
emanated
from
these
two
little
beings
.
Besides
this
,
they
were
on
the
*NL*
throne
.
In
their
toilettes
,
in
their
gayety
,
in
the
noise
which
they
*NL*
made
,
there
was
sovereignty
.
When
they
entered
,
the
Thenardier
said
to
*NL*
them
in
a
grumbling
tone
which
was
full
of
adoration
,
``
Ah
!
there
you
*NL*
are
,
you
children
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
drawing
them
,
one
after
the
other
to
her
knees
,
smoothing
their
*NL*
hair
,
tying
their
ribbons
afresh
,
and
then
releasing
them
with
*NL*
that
gentle
manner
of
shaking
off
which
is
peculiar
to
mothers
,
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
What
frights
they
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
and
seated
themselves
in
the
chimney-corner
.
They
had
a
doll
,
*NL*
which
they
turned
over
and
over
on
their
knees
with
all
sorts
of
joyous
*NL*
chatter
.
From
time
to
time
Cosette
raised
her
eyes
from
her
knitting
,
*NL*
and
watched
their
play
with
a
melancholy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
and
Azelma
did
not
look
at
Cosette
.
She
was
the
same
as
a
dog
*NL*
to
them
.
These
three
little
girls
did
not
yet
reckon
up
four
and
twenty
*NL*
years
between
them
,
but
they
already
represented
the
whole
society
of
*NL*
man
;
envy
on
the
one
side
,
disdain
on
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doll
of
the
Thenardier
sisters
was
very
much
faded
,
very
old
,
and
*NL*
much
broken
;
but
it
seemed
none
the
less
admirable
to
Cosette
,
who
had
*NL*
never
had
a
doll
in
her
life
,
a
real
doll
,
to
make
use
of
the
expression
*NL*
which
all
children
will
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
the
Thenardier
,
who
had
been
going
back
and
forth
in
the
*NL*
room
,
perceived
that
Cosette
's
mind
was
distracted
,
and
that
,
instead
of
*NL*
working
,
she
was
paying
attention
to
the
little
ones
at
their
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
've
caught
you
at
it
!
''
she
cried
.
``
So
that
's
the
way
you
work
!
*NL*
I
'll
make
you
work
to
the
tune
of
the
whip
;
that
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
turned
to
the
Thenardier
,
without
quitting
his
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
,
Madame
,
''
he
said
,
with
an
almost
timid
air
,
``
let
her
play
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
wish
expressed
by
a
traveller
who
had
eaten
a
slice
of
mutton
and
*NL*
had
drunk
a
couple
of
bottles
of
wine
with
his
supper
,
and
who
had
not
*NL*
the
air
of
being
frightfully
poor
,
would
have
been
equivalent
to
an
*NL*
order
.
But
that
a
man
with
such
a
hat
should
permit
himself
such
a
*NL*
desire
,
and
that
a
man
with
such
a
coat
should
permit
himself
to
have
a
*NL*
will
,
was
something
which
Madame
Thenardier
did
not
intend
to
tolerate
.
*NL*
She
retorted
with
acrimony
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
work
,
since
she
eats
.
I
do
n't
feed
her
to
do
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
she
making
?
''
went
on
the
stranger
,
in
a
gentle
voice
which
*NL*
contrasted
strangely
with
his
beggarly
garments
and
his
porter
's
*NL*
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
deigned
to
reply
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stockings
,
if
you
please
.
Stockings
for
my
little
girls
,
who
have
none
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
and
who
are
absolutely
barefoot
just
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
looked
at
Cosette
's
poor
little
red
feet
,
and
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
she
have
finished
this
pair
of
stockings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
at
least
three
or
four
good
days
'
work
on
them
still
,
the
lazy
*NL*
creature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
will
that
pair
of
stockings
be
worth
when
she
has
finished
*NL*
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
cast
a
glance
of
disdain
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty
sous
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
sell
them
for
five
francs
?
''
went
on
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
heavens
!
''
exclaimed
a
carter
who
was
listening
,
with
a
loud
laugh
;
*NL*
``
five
francs
!
the
deuce
,
I
should
think
so
!
five
balls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
thought
it
time
to
strike
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
if
such
is
your
fancy
,
you
will
be
allowed
to
have
that
pair
*NL*
of
stockings
for
five
francs
.
We
can
refuse
nothing
to
travellers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
pay
on
the
spot
,
''
said
the
Thenardier
,
in
her
curt
and
*NL*
peremptory
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
buy
that
pair
of
stockings
,
''
replied
the
man
,
``
and
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
drawing
a
five-franc
piece
from
his
pocket
,
and
laying
it
on
the
table
,
*NL*
``
I
will
pay
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
to
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
own
your
work
;
play
,
my
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carter
was
so
much
touched
by
the
five-franc
piece
,
that
he
*NL*
abandoned
his
glass
and
hastened
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
true
!
''
he
cried
,
examining
it
.
``
A
real
hind
wheel
!
and
not
*NL*
counterfeit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
approached
and
silently
put
the
coin
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
had
no
reply
to
make
.
She
bit
her
lips
,
and
her
face
*NL*
assumed
an
expression
of
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Cosette
was
trembling
.
She
ventured
to
ask
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
true
,
Madame
?
May
I
play
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Play
!
''
said
the
Thenardier
,
in
a
terrible
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Madame
,
''
said
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
while
her
mouth
thanked
the
Thenardier
,
her
whole
little
soul
*NL*
thanked
the
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
had
resumed
his
drinking
;
his
wife
whispered
in
his
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
can
this
yellow
man
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
seen
millionaires
with
coats
like
that
,
''
replied
Thenardier
,
in
*NL*
a
sovereign
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
dropped
her
knitting
,
but
had
not
left
her
seat
.
Cosette
*NL*
always
moved
as
little
as
possible
.
She
picked
up
some
old
rags
and
her
*NL*
little
lead
sword
from
a
box
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
and
Azelma
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
.
They
had
just
*NL*
executed
a
very
important
operation
;
they
had
just
got
hold
of
the
*NL*
cat
.
They
had
thrown
their
doll
on
the
ground
,
and
Eponine
,
who
was
*NL*
the
elder
,
was
swathing
the
little
cat
,
in
spite
of
its
mewing
and
its
*NL*
contortions
,
in
a
quantity
of
clothes
and
red
and
blue
scraps
.
While
*NL*
performing
this
serious
and
difficult
work
she
was
saying
to
her
sister
*NL*
in
that
sweet
and
adorable
language
of
children
,
whose
grace
,
like
the
*NL*
splendor
of
the
butterfly
's
wing
,
vanishes
when
one
essays
to
fix
it
*NL*
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
sister
,
this
doll
is
more
amusing
than
the
other
.
She
twists
,
*NL*
she
cries
,
she
is
warm
.
See
,
sister
,
let
us
play
with
her
.
She
shall
be
*NL*
my
little
girl
.
I
will
be
a
lady
.
I
will
come
to
see
you
,
and
you
shall
*NL*
look
at
her
.
Gradually
,
you
will
perceive
her
whiskers
,
and
that
will
*NL*
surprise
you
.
And
then
you
will
see
her
ears
,
and
then
you
will
see
her
*NL*
tail
and
it
will
amaze
you
.
And
you
will
say
to
me
,
`
Ah
!
Mon
Dieu
!
'
and
*NL*
I
will
say
to
you
:
`
Yes
,
Madame
,
it
is
my
little
girl
.
Little
girls
are
*NL*
made
like
that
just
at
present
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Azelma
listened
admiringly
to
Eponine
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
drinkers
had
begun
to
sing
an
obscene
song
,
and
*NL*
to
laugh
at
it
until
the
ceiling
shook
.
Thenardier
accompanied
and
*NL*
encouraged
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
birds
make
nests
out
of
everything
,
so
children
make
a
doll
out
of
*NL*
anything
which
comes
to
hand
.
While
Eponine
and
Azelma
were
bundling
up
*NL*
the
cat
,
Cosette
,
on
her
side
,
had
dressed
up
her
sword
.
That
done
,
she
*NL*
laid
it
in
her
arms
,
and
sang
to
it
softly
,
to
lull
it
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doll
is
one
of
the
most
imperious
needs
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
one
*NL*
of
the
most
charming
instincts
of
feminine
childhood
.
To
care
for
,
to
*NL*
clothe
,
to
deck
,
to
dress
,
to
undress
,
to
redress
,
to
teach
,
scold
a
*NL*
little
,
to
rock
,
to
dandle
,
to
lull
to
sleep
,
to
imagine
that
something
*NL*
is
some
one
,
--
therein
lies
the
whole
woman
's
future
.
While
dreaming
and
*NL*
chattering
,
making
tiny
outfits
,
and
baby
clothes
,
while
sewing
little
*NL*
gowns
,
and
corsages
and
bodices
,
the
child
grows
into
a
young
girl
,
the
*NL*
young
girl
into
a
big
girl
,
the
big
girl
into
a
woman
.
The
first
child
*NL*
is
the
continuation
of
the
last
doll
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
girl
without
a
doll
is
almost
as
unhappy
,
and
quite
as
*NL*
impossible
,
as
a
woman
without
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Cosette
had
made
herself
a
doll
out
of
the
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
approached
the
yellow
man
;
``
My
husband
is
right
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
;
``
perhaps
it
is
M.
Laffitte
;
there
are
such
queer
rich
men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
and
set
her
elbows
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
she
.
At
this
word
,
Monsieur
,
the
man
turned
;
up
to
that
*NL*
time
,
the
Thenardier
had
addressed
him
only
as
brave
homme
or
bonhomme
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
sir
,
''
she
pursued
,
assuming
a
sweetish
air
that
was
even
more
*NL*
repulsive
to
behold
than
her
fierce
mien
,
``
I
am
willing
that
the
child
*NL*
should
play
;
I
do
not
oppose
it
,
but
it
is
good
for
once
,
because
you
*NL*
are
generous
.
You
see
,
she
has
nothing
;
she
must
needs
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
this
child
is
not
yours
?
''
demanded
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
mon
Dieu
!
no
,
sir
!
she
is
a
little
beggar
whom
we
have
taken
in
*NL*
through
charity
;
a
sort
of
imbecile
child
.
She
must
have
water
on
the
*NL*
brain
;
she
has
a
large
head
,
as
you
see
.
We
do
what
we
can
for
her
,
for
*NL*
we
are
not
rich
;
we
have
written
in
vain
to
her
native
place
,
and
have
*NL*
received
no
reply
these
six
months
.
It
must
be
that
her
mother
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
man
,
and
fell
into
his
revery
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
mother
did
n't
amount
to
much
,
''
added
the
Thenardier
;
``
she
abandoned
*NL*
her
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
whole
of
this
conversation
Cosette
,
as
though
warned
by
some
*NL*
instinct
that
she
was
under
discussion
,
had
not
taken
her
eyes
from
the
*NL*
Thenardier
's
face
;
she
listened
vaguely
;
she
caught
a
few
words
here
and
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
drinkers
,
all
three-quarters
intoxicated
,
were
repeating
*NL*
their
unclean
refrain
with
redoubled
gayety
;
it
was
a
highly
spiced
and
*NL*
wanton
song
,
in
which
the
Virgin
and
the
infant
Jesus
were
introduced
.
*NL*
The
Thenardier
went
off
to
take
part
in
the
shouts
of
laughter
.
Cosette
,
*NL*
from
her
post
under
the
table
,
gazed
at
the
fire
,
which
was
reflected
*NL*
from
her
fixed
eyes
.
She
had
begun
to
rock
the
sort
of
baby
which
she
*NL*
had
made
,
and
,
as
she
rocked
it
,
she
sang
in
a
low
voice
,
``
My
mother
is
*NL*
dead
!
my
mother
is
dead
!
my
mother
is
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
being
urged
afresh
by
the
hostess
,
the
yellow
man
,
``
the
millionaire
,
''
*NL*
consented
at
last
to
take
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Monsieur
wish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bread
and
cheese
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
he
is
a
beggar
''
thought
Madame
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drunken
men
were
still
singing
their
song
,
and
the
child
under
the
*NL*
table
was
singing
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
Cosette
paused
;
she
had
just
turned
round
and
caught
sight
*NL*
of
the
little
Thenardiers
'
doll
,
which
they
had
abandoned
for
the
cat
*NL*
and
had
left
on
the
floor
a
few
paces
from
the
kitchen
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
dropped
the
swaddled
sword
,
which
only
half
met
her
needs
,
and
*NL*
cast
her
eyes
slowly
round
the
room
.
Madame
Thenardier
was
whispering
to
*NL*
her
husband
and
counting
over
some
money
;
Ponine
and
Zelma
were
playing
*NL*
with
the
cat
;
the
travellers
were
eating
or
drinking
or
singing
;
not
*NL*
a
glance
was
fixed
on
her
.
She
had
not
a
moment
to
lose
;
she
crept
out
*NL*
from
under
the
table
on
her
hands
and
knees
,
made
sure
once
more
that
no
*NL*
one
was
watching
her
;
then
she
slipped
quickly
up
to
the
doll
and
seized
*NL*
it
.
An
instant
later
she
was
in
her
place
again
,
seated
motionless
,
and
*NL*
only
turned
so
as
to
cast
a
shadow
on
the
doll
which
she
held
in
her
*NL*
arms
.
The
happiness
of
playing
with
a
doll
was
so
rare
for
her
that
it
*NL*
contained
all
the
violence
of
voluptuousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
had
seen
her
,
except
the
traveller
,
who
was
slowly
devouring
his
*NL*
meagre
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
joy
lasted
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
with
all
the
precautions
that
Cosette
had
taken
she
did
not
perceive
*NL*
that
one
of
the
doll
's
legs
stuck
out
and
that
the
fire
on
the
hearth
*NL*
lighted
it
up
very
vividly
.
That
pink
and
shining
foot
,
projecting
from
*NL*
the
shadow
,
suddenly
struck
the
eye
of
Azelma
,
who
said
to
Eponine
,
*NL*
``
Look
!
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
little
girls
paused
in
stupefaction
;
Cosette
had
dared
to
take
*NL*
their
doll
!
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
rose
,
and
,
without
releasing
the
cat
,
she
ran
to
her
mother
,
and
*NL*
began
to
tug
at
her
skirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
!
''
said
her
mother
;
``
what
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
''
said
the
child
,
``
look
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
pointed
to
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
absorbed
in
the
ecstasies
of
possession
,
no
longer
saw
or
heard
*NL*
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
's
countenance
assumed
that
peculiar
expression
which
*NL*
is
composed
of
the
terrible
mingled
with
the
trifles
of
life
,
and
which
*NL*
has
caused
this
style
of
woman
to
be
named
megaeras
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
,
wounded
pride
exasperated
her
wrath
still
further
.
*NL*
Cosette
had
overstepped
all
bounds
;
Cosette
had
laid
violent
hands
on
*NL*
the
doll
belonging
to
``
these
young
ladies
.
''
A
czarina
who
should
see
*NL*
a
muzhik
trying
on
her
imperial
son
's
blue
ribbon
would
wear
no
other
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shrieked
in
a
voice
rendered
hoarse
with
indignation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
started
as
though
the
earth
had
trembled
beneath
her
;
she
turned
*NL*
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
repeated
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
took
the
doll
and
laid
it
gently
on
the
floor
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
veneration
,
mingled
with
despair
;
then
,
without
taking
her
eyes
from
*NL*
it
,
she
clasped
her
hands
,
and
,
what
is
terrible
to
relate
of
a
child
*NL*
of
that
age
,
she
wrung
them
;
then
--
not
one
of
the
emotions
of
the
day
,
*NL*
neither
the
trip
to
the
forest
,
nor
the
weight
of
the
bucket
of
water
,
*NL*
nor
the
loss
of
the
money
,
nor
the
sight
of
the
whip
,
nor
even
the
sad
*NL*
words
which
she
had
heard
Madame
Thenardier
utter
had
been
able
to
wring
*NL*
this
from
her
--
she
wept
;
she
burst
out
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
the
traveller
had
risen
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
he
said
to
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
?
''
said
the
Thenardier
,
pointing
to
the
corpus
delicti
*NL*
which
lay
at
Cosette
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
of
it
?
''
resumed
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
beggar
,
''
replied
the
Thenardier
,
``
has
permitted
herself
to
touch
*NL*
the
children
's
doll
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
this
noise
for
that
!
''
said
the
man
;
``
well
,
what
if
she
did
play
*NL*
with
that
doll
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
touched
it
with
her
dirty
hands
!
''
pursued
the
Thenardier
,
``
with
her
*NL*
frightful
hands
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Cosette
redoubled
her
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
stop
your
noise
?
''
screamed
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
went
straight
to
the
street
door
,
opened
it
,
and
stepped
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
gone
,
the
Thenardier
profited
by
his
absence
to
give
*NL*
Cosette
a
hearty
kick
under
the
table
,
which
made
the
child
utter
loud
*NL*
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
again
,
the
man
re-appeared
;
he
carried
in
both
hands
the
*NL*
fabulous
doll
which
we
have
mentioned
,
and
which
all
the
village
brats
*NL*
had
been
staring
at
ever
since
the
morning
,
and
he
set
it
upright
in
*NL*
front
of
Cosette
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
;
this
is
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
supposed
that
in
the
course
of
the
hour
and
more
which
he
had
*NL*
spent
there
he
had
taken
confused
notice
through
his
revery
of
that
*NL*
toy
shop
,
lighted
up
by
fire-pots
and
candles
so
splendidly
that
it
was
*NL*
visible
like
an
illumination
through
the
window
of
the
drinking-shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
raised
her
eyes
;
she
gazed
at
the
man
approaching
her
with
that
*NL*
doll
as
she
might
have
gazed
at
the
sun
;
she
heard
the
unprecedented
*NL*
words
,
``
It
is
for
you
''
;
she
stared
at
him
;
she
stared
at
the
doll
;
then
*NL*
she
slowly
retreated
,
and
hid
herself
at
the
extreme
end
,
under
the
*NL*
table
in
a
corner
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
cried
;
she
no
longer
wept
;
she
had
the
appearance
of
no
*NL*
longer
daring
to
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
,
Eponine
,
and
Azelma
were
like
statues
also
;
the
very
*NL*
drinkers
had
paused
;
a
solemn
silence
reigned
through
the
whole
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
,
petrified
and
mute
,
recommenced
her
conjectures
:
``
Who
*NL*
is
that
old
fellow
?
Is
he
a
poor
man
?
Is
he
a
millionaire
?
Perhaps
he
is
*NL*
both
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
face
of
the
male
Thenardier
presented
that
expressive
fold
which
*NL*
accentuates
the
human
countenance
whenever
the
dominant
instinct
appears
*NL*
there
in
all
its
bestial
force
.
The
tavern-keeper
stared
alternately
at
*NL*
the
doll
and
at
the
traveller
;
he
seemed
to
be
scenting
out
the
man
,
as
*NL*
he
would
have
scented
out
a
bag
of
money
.
This
did
not
last
longer
than
*NL*
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
.
He
stepped
up
to
his
wife
and
said
to
*NL*
her
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
machine
costs
at
least
thirty
francs
.
No
nonsense
.
Down
on
your
*NL*
belly
before
that
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gross
natures
have
this
in
common
with
naive
natures
,
that
they
possess
*NL*
no
transition
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Cosette
,
''
said
the
Thenardier
,
in
a
voice
that
strove
to
be
*NL*
sweet
,
and
which
was
composed
of
the
bitter
honey
of
malicious
women
,
*NL*
``
are
n't
you
going
to
take
your
doll
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
ventured
to
emerge
from
her
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
has
given
you
a
doll
,
my
little
Cosette
,
''
said
*NL*
Thenardier
,
with
a
caressing
air
.
``
Take
it
;
it
is
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
gazed
at
the
marvellous
doll
in
a
sort
of
terror
.
Her
face
was
*NL*
still
flooded
with
tears
,
but
her
eyes
began
to
fill
,
like
the
sky
at
*NL*
daybreak
,
with
strange
beams
of
joy
.
What
she
felt
at
that
moment
was
*NL*
a
little
like
what
she
would
have
felt
if
she
had
been
abruptly
told
,
*NL*
``
Little
one
,
you
are
the
Queen
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
that
if
she
touched
that
doll
,
lightning
would
dart
*NL*
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
true
,
up
to
a
certain
point
,
for
she
said
to
herself
that
the
*NL*
Thenardier
would
scold
and
beat
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
attraction
carried
the
day
.
She
ended
by
drawing
near
*NL*
and
murmuring
timidly
as
she
turned
towards
Madame
Thenardier
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
,
Madame
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
words
can
render
that
air
,
at
once
despairing
,
terrified
,
and
*NL*
ecstatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardi
!
''
cried
the
Thenardier
,
``
it
is
yours
.
The
gentleman
has
given
it
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
sir
?
''
said
Cosette
.
``
Is
it
true
?
Is
the
`
lady
'
mine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
's
eyes
seemed
to
be
full
of
tears
.
He
appeared
to
have
*NL*
reached
that
point
of
emotion
where
a
man
does
not
speak
for
fear
lest
*NL*
he
should
weep
.
He
nodded
to
Cosette
,
and
placed
the
``
lady
's
''
hand
in
*NL*
her
tiny
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
hastily
withdrew
her
hand
,
as
though
that
of
the
``
lady
''
scorched
*NL*
her
,
and
began
to
stare
at
the
floor
.
We
are
forced
to
add
that
at
that
*NL*
moment
she
stuck
out
her
tongue
immoderately
.
All
at
once
she
wheeled
*NL*
round
and
seized
the
doll
in
a
transport
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
call
her
Catherine
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
odd
moment
when
Cosette
's
rags
met
and
clasped
the
ribbons
and
*NL*
fresh
pink
muslins
of
the
doll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
she
resumed
,
``
may
I
put
her
on
a
chair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
child
,
''
replied
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
the
turn
of
Eponine
and
Azelma
to
gaze
at
Cosette
with
envy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
placed
Catherine
on
a
chair
,
then
seated
herself
on
the
floor
*NL*
in
front
of
her
,
and
remained
motionless
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
in
an
*NL*
attitude
of
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Play
,
Cosette
,
''
said
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
am
playing
,
''
returned
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stranger
,
this
unknown
individual
,
who
had
the
air
of
a
visit
which
*NL*
Providence
was
making
on
Cosette
,
was
the
person
whom
the
Thenardier
*NL*
hated
worse
than
any
one
in
the
world
at
that
moment
.
However
,
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
control
herself
.
Habituated
as
she
was
to
dissimulation
*NL*
through
endeavoring
to
copy
her
husband
in
all
his
actions
,
these
*NL*
emotions
were
more
than
she
could
endure
.
She
made
haste
to
send
her
*NL*
daughters
to
bed
,
then
she
asked
the
man
's
permission
to
send
Cosette
*NL*
off
also
;
``
for
she
has
worked
hard
all
day
,
''
she
added
with
a
maternal
*NL*
air
.
Cosette
went
off
to
bed
,
carrying
Catherine
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
the
Thenardier
went
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
where
*NL*
her
husband
was
,
to
relieve
her
soul
,
as
she
said
.
She
exchanged
with
*NL*
her
husband
words
which
were
all
the
more
furious
because
she
dared
not
*NL*
utter
them
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
beast
!
What
has
he
got
in
his
belly
,
to
come
and
upset
us
in
this
*NL*
manner
!
To
want
that
little
monster
to
play
!
to
give
away
forty-franc
*NL*
dolls
to
a
jade
that
I
would
sell
for
forty
sous
,
so
I
would
!
A
little
*NL*
more
and
he
will
be
saying
Your
Majesty
to
her
,
as
though
to
the
Duchess
*NL*
de
Berry
!
Is
there
any
sense
in
it
?
Is
he
mad
,
then
,
that
mysterious
old
*NL*
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
it
is
perfectly
simple
,
''
replied
Thenardier
,
``
if
that
amuses
him
!
*NL*
It
amuses
you
to
have
the
little
one
work
;
it
amuses
him
to
have
her
*NL*
play
.
He
's
all
right
.
A
traveller
can
do
what
he
pleases
when
he
pays
*NL*
for
it
.
If
the
old
fellow
is
a
philanthropist
,
what
is
that
to
you
?
If
*NL*
he
is
an
imbecile
,
it
does
not
concern
you
.
What
are
you
worrying
for
,
*NL*
so
long
as
he
has
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
language
of
a
master
,
and
the
reasoning
of
an
innkeeper
,
neither
of
*NL*
which
admitted
of
any
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
had
placed
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
and
resumed
his
thoughtful
*NL*
attitude
.
All
the
other
travellers
,
both
pedlers
and
carters
,
had
*NL*
withdrawn
a
little
,
and
had
ceased
singing
.
They
were
staring
at
him
*NL*
from
a
distance
,
with
a
sort
of
respectful
awe
.
This
poorly
dressed
*NL*
man
,
who
drew
``
hind-wheels
''
from
his
pocket
with
so
much
ease
,
and
*NL*
who
lavished
gigantic
dolls
on
dirty
little
brats
in
wooden
shoes
,
was
*NL*
certainly
a
magnificent
fellow
,
and
one
to
be
feared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
hours
passed
.
The
midnight
mass
was
over
,
the
chimes
had
ceased
,
*NL*
the
drinkers
had
taken
their
departure
,
the
drinking-shop
was
closed
,
*NL*
the
public
room
was
deserted
,
the
fire
extinct
,
the
stranger
still
*NL*
remained
in
the
same
place
and
the
same
attitude
.
From
time
to
time
he
*NL*
changed
the
elbow
on
which
he
leaned
.
That
was
all
;
but
he
had
not
said
*NL*
a
word
since
Cosette
had
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardiers
alone
,
out
of
politeness
and
curiosity
,
had
remained
in
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
going
to
pass
the
night
in
that
fashion
?
''
grumbled
the
*NL*
Thenardier
.
When
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
struck
,
she
declared
herself
*NL*
vanquished
,
and
said
to
her
husband
,
``
I
'm
going
to
bed
.
Do
as
you
like
.
''
*NL*
Her
husband
seated
himself
at
a
table
in
the
corner
,
lighted
a
candle
,
*NL*
and
began
to
read
the
Courrier
Francais
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
hour
passed
thus
.
The
worthy
inn-keeper
had
perused
the
Courrier
*NL*
Francais
at
least
three
times
,
from
the
date
of
the
number
to
the
*NL*
printer
's
name
.
The
stranger
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
fidgeted
,
coughed
,
spit
,
blew
his
nose
,
and
creaked
his
*NL*
chair
.
Not
a
movement
on
the
man
's
part
.
``
Is
he
asleep
?
''
thought
*NL*
Thenardier
.
The
man
was
not
asleep
,
but
nothing
could
arouse
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
Thenardier
took
off
his
cap
,
stepped
gently
up
to
him
,
and
*NL*
ventured
to
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
Monsieur
going
to
his
repose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
going
to
bed
would
have
seemed
to
him
excessive
and
familiar
.
To
*NL*
repose
smacked
of
luxury
and
respect
.
These
words
possess
the
mysterious
*NL*
and
admirable
property
of
swelling
the
bill
on
the
following
day
.
A
*NL*
chamber
where
one
sleeps
costs
twenty
sous
;
a
chamber
in
which
one
*NL*
reposes
costs
twenty
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
said
the
stranger
,
``
you
are
right
.
Where
is
your
stable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
!
''
exclaimed
Thenardier
,
with
a
smile
,
``
I
will
conduct
you
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
candle
;
the
man
picked
up
his
bundle
and
cudgel
,
and
*NL*
Thenardier
conducted
him
to
a
chamber
on
the
first
floor
,
which
was
of
*NL*
rare
splendor
,
all
furnished
in
mahogany
,
with
a
low
bedstead
,
curtained
*NL*
with
red
calico
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
this
?
''
said
the
traveller
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
really
our
bridal
chamber
,
''
said
the
tavern-keeper
.
``
My
wife
and
*NL*
I
occupy
another
.
This
is
only
entered
three
or
four
times
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
liked
the
stable
quite
as
well
,
''
said
the
man
,
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
pretended
not
to
hear
this
unamiable
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lighted
two
perfectly
fresh
wax
candles
which
figured
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
.
A
very
good
fire
was
flickering
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
chimney-piece
,
under
a
glass
globe
,
stood
a
woman
's
head-dress
in
*NL*
silver
wire
and
orange
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
this
?
''
resumed
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
sir
,
''
said
Thenardier
,
``
is
my
wife
's
wedding
bonnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
surveyed
the
object
with
a
glance
which
seemed
to
say
,
*NL*
``
There
really
was
a
time
,
then
,
when
that
monster
was
a
maiden
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
lied
,
however
.
When
he
had
leased
this
paltry
building
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
converting
it
into
a
tavern
,
he
had
found
this
chamber
*NL*
decorated
in
just
this
manner
,
and
had
purchased
the
furniture
and
*NL*
obtained
the
orange
flowers
at
second
hand
,
with
the
idea
that
this
*NL*
would
cast
a
graceful
shadow
on
``
his
spouse
,
''
and
would
result
in
what
*NL*
the
English
call
respectability
for
his
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
traveller
turned
round
,
the
host
had
disappeared
.
Thenardier
*NL*
had
withdrawn
discreetly
,
without
venturing
to
wish
him
a
good
night
,
*NL*
as
he
did
not
wish
to
treat
with
disrespectful
cordiality
a
man
whom
he
*NL*
proposed
to
fleece
royally
the
following
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inn-keeper
retired
to
his
room
.
His
wife
was
in
bed
,
but
she
was
not
*NL*
asleep
.
When
she
heard
her
husband
's
step
she
turned
over
and
said
to
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
I
'm
going
to
turn
Cosette
out
of
doors
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
replied
coldly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
you
do
go
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
exchanged
no
further
words
,
and
a
few
moments
later
their
candle
*NL*
was
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
traveller
,
he
had
deposited
his
cudgel
and
his
bundle
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
The
landlord
once
gone
,
he
threw
himself
into
an
arm-chair
and
*NL*
remained
for
some
time
buried
in
thought
.
Then
he
removed
his
shoes
,
*NL*
took
one
of
the
two
candles
,
blew
out
the
other
,
opened
the
door
,
and
*NL*
quitted
the
room
,
gazing
about
him
like
a
person
who
is
in
search
of
*NL*
something
.
He
traversed
a
corridor
and
came
upon
a
staircase
.
There
he
*NL*
heard
a
very
faint
and
gentle
sound
like
the
breathing
of
a
child
.
He
*NL*
followed
this
sound
,
and
came
to
a
sort
of
triangular
recess
built
under
*NL*
the
staircase
,
or
rather
formed
by
the
staircase
itself
.
This
recess
was
*NL*
nothing
else
than
the
space
under
the
steps
.
There
,
in
the
midst
of
all
*NL*
sorts
of
old
papers
and
potsherds
,
among
dust
and
spiders
'
webs
,
was
a
*NL*
bed
--
if
one
can
call
by
the
name
of
bed
a
straw
pallet
so
full
of
holes
*NL*
as
to
display
the
straw
,
and
a
coverlet
so
tattered
as
to
show
the
*NL*
pallet
.
No
sheets
.
This
was
placed
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
bed
Cosette
was
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
approached
and
gazed
down
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
in
a
profound
sleep
;
she
was
fully
dressed
.
In
the
winter
*NL*
she
did
not
undress
,
in
order
that
she
might
not
be
so
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Against
her
breast
was
pressed
the
doll
,
whose
large
eyes
,
wide
open
,
*NL*
glittered
in
the
dark
.
From
time
to
time
she
gave
vent
to
a
deep
sigh
as
*NL*
though
she
were
on
the
point
of
waking
,
and
she
strained
the
doll
almost
*NL*
convulsively
in
her
arms
.
Beside
her
bed
there
was
only
one
of
her
*NL*
wooden
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
door
which
stood
open
near
Cosette
's
pallet
permitted
a
view
of
a
*NL*
rather
large
,
dark
room
.
The
stranger
stepped
into
it
.
At
the
further
*NL*
extremity
,
through
a
glass
door
,
he
saw
two
small
,
very
white
beds
.
*NL*
They
belonged
to
Eponine
and
Azelma
.
Behind
these
beds
,
and
half
hidden
,
*NL*
stood
an
uncurtained
wicker
cradle
,
in
which
the
little
boy
who
had
*NL*
cried
all
the
evening
lay
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
conjectured
that
this
chamber
connected
with
that
of
the
*NL*
Thenardier
pair
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
retreating
when
his
eye
fell
*NL*
upon
the
fireplace
--
one
of
those
vast
tavern
chimneys
where
there
is
*NL*
always
so
little
fire
when
there
is
any
fire
at
all
,
and
which
are
*NL*
so
cold
to
look
at
.
There
was
no
fire
in
this
one
,
there
was
not
even
*NL*
ashes
;
but
there
was
something
which
attracted
the
stranger
's
gaze
,
*NL*
nevertheless
.
It
was
two
tiny
children
's
shoes
,
coquettish
in
shape
*NL*
and
unequal
in
size
.
The
traveller
recalled
the
graceful
and
immemorial
*NL*
custom
in
accordance
with
which
children
place
their
shoes
in
the
*NL*
chimney
on
Christmas
eve
,
there
to
await
in
the
darkness
some
sparkling
*NL*
gift
from
their
good
fairy
.
Eponine
and
Azelma
had
taken
care
not
to
*NL*
omit
this
,
and
each
of
them
had
set
one
of
her
shoes
on
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
bent
over
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fairy
,
that
is
to
say
,
their
mother
,
had
already
paid
her
visit
,
and
*NL*
in
each
he
saw
a
brand-new
and
shining
ten-sou
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
straightened
himself
up
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
,
*NL*
when
far
in
,
in
the
darkest
corner
of
the
hearth
,
he
caught
sight
*NL*
of
another
object
.
He
looked
at
it
,
and
recognized
a
wooden
shoe
,
a
*NL*
frightful
shoe
of
the
coarsest
description
,
half
dilapidated
and
all
*NL*
covered
with
ashes
and
dried
mud
.
It
was
Cosette
's
sabot
.
Cosette
,
with
*NL*
that
touching
trust
of
childhood
,
which
can
always
be
deceived
yet
never
*NL*
discouraged
,
had
placed
her
shoe
on
the
hearth-stone
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hope
in
a
child
who
has
never
known
anything
but
despair
is
a
sweet
and
*NL*
touching
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
in
this
wooden
shoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
,
bent
over
and
placed
a
louis
d'or
*NL*
in
Cosette
's
shoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
regained
his
own
chamber
with
the
stealthy
tread
of
a
wolf
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
THENARDIER
AND
HIS
MANOEUVRES
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
morning
,
two
hours
at
least
before
day-break
,
*NL*
Thenardier
,
seated
beside
a
candle
in
the
public
room
of
the
tavern
,
pen
*NL*
in
hand
,
was
making
out
the
bill
for
the
traveller
with
the
yellow
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wife
,
standing
beside
him
,
and
half
bent
over
him
,
was
following
*NL*
him
with
her
eyes
.
They
exchanged
not
a
word
.
On
the
one
hand
,
there
was
*NL*
profound
meditation
,
on
the
other
,
the
religious
admiration
with
which
*NL*
one
watches
the
birth
and
development
of
a
marvel
of
the
human
mind
.
A
*NL*
noise
was
audible
in
the
house
;
it
was
the
Lark
sweeping
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lapse
of
a
good
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
some
erasures
,
*NL*
Thenardier
produced
the
following
masterpiece
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
BILL
OF
THE
GENTLEMAN

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Service
was
written
servisse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-three
francs
!
''
cried
the
woman
,
with
an
enthusiasm
which
was
*NL*
mingled
with
some
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
all
great
artists
,
Thenardier
was
dissatisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peuh
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
accent
of
Castlereagh
auditing
France
's
bill
at
the
Congress
*NL*
of
Vienna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Thenardier
,
you
are
right
;
he
certainly
owes
that
,
''
murmured
*NL*
the
wife
,
who
was
thinking
of
the
doll
bestowed
on
Cosette
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
her
daughters
.
``
It
is
just
,
but
it
is
too
much
.
He
will
not
*NL*
pay
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
laughed
coldly
,
as
usual
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
laugh
was
the
supreme
assertion
of
certainty
and
authority
.
That
*NL*
which
was
asserted
in
this
manner
must
needs
be
so
.
His
wife
did
not
*NL*
insist
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
about
arranging
the
table
;
her
husband
paced
the
room
.
A
moment
*NL*
later
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
owe
full
fifteen
hundred
francs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
and
seated
himself
in
the
chimney-corner
,
meditating
,
with
his
*NL*
feet
among
the
warm
ashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
by
the
way
,
''
resumed
his
wife
,
``
you
do
n't
forget
that
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
turn
Cosette
out
of
doors
to-day
?
The
monster
!
She
breaks
my
heart
with
*NL*
that
doll
of
hers
!
I
'd
rather
marry
Louis
XVIII
.
than
keep
her
another
*NL*
day
in
the
house
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
lighted
his
pipe
,
and
replied
between
two
puffs
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
hand
that
bill
to
the
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
he
left
the
room
when
the
traveller
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
instantly
reappeared
behind
him
and
remained
motionless
in
*NL*
the
half-open
door
,
visible
only
to
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
yellow
man
carried
his
bundle
and
his
cudgel
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Up
so
early
?
''
said
Madame
Thenardier
;
``
is
Monsieur
leaving
us
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
thus
,
she
was
twisting
the
bill
about
in
her
hands
with
an
*NL*
embarrassed
air
,
and
making
creases
in
it
with
her
nails
.
Her
hard
*NL*
face
presented
a
shade
which
was
not
habitual
with
it
,
--
timidity
and
*NL*
scruples
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
present
such
a
bill
to
a
man
who
had
so
completely
the
air
``
of
a
poor
*NL*
wretch
''
seemed
difficult
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
traveller
appeared
to
be
preoccupied
and
absent-minded
.
He
*NL*
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Madame
,
I
am
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
Monsieur
has
no
business
in
Montfermeil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
was
passing
through
.
That
is
all
.
What
do
I
owe
you
,
Madame
,
''
he
*NL*
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
silently
handed
him
the
folded
bill
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
unfolded
the
paper
and
glanced
at
it
;
but
his
thoughts
were
*NL*
evidently
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
is
business
good
here
in
Montfermeil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
so
,
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
Thenardier
,
stupefied
at
not
witnessing
*NL*
another
sort
of
explosion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
,
in
a
dreary
and
lamentable
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Monsieur
,
times
are
so
hard
!
and
then
,
we
have
so
few
bourgeois
in
*NL*
the
neighborhood
!
All
the
people
are
poor
,
you
see
.
If
we
had
not
,
now
*NL*
and
then
,
some
rich
and
generous
travellers
like
Monsieur
,
we
should
*NL*
not
get
along
at
all
.
We
have
so
many
expenses
.
Just
see
,
that
child
is
*NL*
costing
us
our
very
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
little
one
,
you
know
!
Cosette
--
the
Lark
,
as
she
is
called
*NL*
hereabouts
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupid
these
peasants
are
with
their
nicknames
!
She
has
more
the
*NL*
air
of
a
bat
than
of
a
lark
.
You
see
,
sir
,
we
do
not
ask
charity
,
and
we
*NL*
can
not
bestow
it
.
We
earn
nothing
and
we
have
to
pay
out
a
great
deal
.
*NL*
The
license
,
the
imposts
,
the
door
and
window
tax
,
the
hundredths
!
*NL*
Monsieur
is
aware
that
the
government
demands
a
terrible
deal
of
money
.
*NL*
And
then
,
I
have
my
daughters
.
I
have
no
need
to
bring
up
other
people
's
*NL*
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
resumed
,
in
that
voice
which
he
strove
to
render
indifferent
,
*NL*
and
in
which
there
lingered
a
tremor
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
one
were
to
rid
you
of
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
Cosette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlady
's
red
and
violent
face
brightened
up
hideously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
sir
,
my
dear
sir
,
take
her
,
keep
her
,
lead
her
off
,
carry
her
*NL*
away
,
sugar
her
,
stuff
her
with
truffles
,
drink
her
,
eat
her
,
and
the
*NL*
blessings
of
the
good
holy
Virgin
and
of
all
the
saints
of
paradise
be
*NL*
upon
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
You
will
take
her
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
take
her
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
.
Call
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
screamed
the
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
meantime
,
''
pursued
the
man
,
``
I
will
pay
you
what
I
owe
you
.
How
*NL*
much
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cast
a
glance
on
the
bill
,
and
could
not
restrain
a
start
of
*NL*
surprise
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-three
francs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
the
landlady
,
and
repeated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-three
francs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
the
enunciation
of
these
words
,
thus
repeated
,
an
accent
*NL*
between
an
exclamation
and
an
interrogation
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
had
had
time
to
prepare
herself
for
the
shock
.
She
*NL*
replied
,
with
assurance
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
yes
,
sir
,
it
is
twenty-three
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
laid
five
five-franc
pieces
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
get
the
child
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
Thenardier
advanced
to
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
owes
twenty-six
sous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-six
sous
!
''
exclaimed
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
sous
for
the
chamber
,
''
resumed
Thenardier
,
coldly
,
``
and
six
sous
*NL*
for
his
supper
.
As
for
the
child
,
I
must
discuss
that
matter
a
little
*NL*
with
the
gentleman
.
Leave
us
,
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
was
dazzled
as
with
the
shock
caused
by
unexpected
*NL*
lightning
flashes
of
talent
.
She
was
conscious
that
a
great
actor
was
*NL*
making
his
entrance
on
the
stage
,
uttered
not
a
word
in
reply
,
and
left
*NL*
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
were
alone
,
Thenardier
offered
the
traveller
a
chair
.
*NL*
The
traveller
seated
himself
;
Thenardier
remained
standing
,
and
his
face
*NL*
assumed
a
singular
expression
of
good-fellowship
and
simplicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
I
have
to
say
to
you
is
this
,
that
I
adore
that
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
gazed
intently
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strange
it
is
,
one
grows
attached
.
What
money
is
that
?
Take
back
*NL*
your
hundred-sou
piece
.
I
adore
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whom
do
you
mean
?

demanded
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
!
our
little
Cosette
!
Are
you
not
intending
to
take
her
away
from
*NL*
us
?
Well
,
I
speak
frankly
;
as
true
as
you
are
an
honest
man
,
I
will
not
*NL*
consent
to
it
.
I
shall
miss
that
child
.
I
saw
her
first
when
she
was
a
*NL*
tiny
thing
.
It
is
true
that
she
costs
us
money
;
it
is
true
that
she
has
*NL*
her
faults
;
it
is
true
that
we
are
not
rich
;
it
is
true
that
I
have
paid
*NL*
out
over
four
hundred
francs
for
drugs
for
just
one
of
her
illnesses
!
*NL*
But
one
must
do
something
for
the
good
God
's
sake
.
She
has
neither
*NL*
father
nor
mother
.
I
have
brought
her
up
.
I
have
bread
enough
for
*NL*
her
and
for
myself
.
In
truth
,
I
think
a
great
deal
of
that
child
.
You
*NL*
understand
,
one
conceives
an
affection
for
a
person
;
I
am
a
good
sort
*NL*
of
a
beast
,
I
am
;
I
do
not
reason
;
I
love
that
little
girl
;
my
wife
is
*NL*
quick-tempered
,
but
she
loves
her
also
.
You
see
,
she
is
just
the
same
as
*NL*
our
own
child
.
I
want
to
keep
her
to
babble
about
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
kept
his
eye
intently
fixed
on
Thenardier
.
The
latter
*NL*
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
,
but
one
does
not
give
away
one
's
child
to
a
passer-by
,
*NL*
like
that
.
I
am
right
,
am
I
not
?
Still
,
I
do
n't
say
--
you
are
rich
;
you
*NL*
have
the
air
of
a
very
good
man
,
--
if
it
were
for
her
happiness
.
But
one
*NL*
must
find
out
that
.
You
understand
:
suppose
that
I
were
to
let
her
go
*NL*
and
to
sacrifice
myself
,
I
should
like
to
know
what
becomes
of
her
;
I
*NL*
should
not
wish
to
lose
sight
of
her
;
I
should
like
to
know
with
whom
*NL*
she
is
living
,
so
that
I
could
go
to
see
her
from
time
to
time
;
so
that
*NL*
she
may
know
that
her
good
foster-father
is
alive
,
that
he
is
watching
*NL*
over
her
.
In
short
,
there
are
things
which
are
not
possible
.
I
do
not
*NL*
even
know
your
name
.
If
you
were
to
take
her
away
,
I
should
say
:
`
Well
,
*NL*
and
the
Lark
,
what
has
become
of
her
?
'
One
must
,
at
least
,
see
some
*NL*
petty
scrap
of
paper
,
some
trifle
in
the
way
of
a
passport
,
you
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
,
still
surveying
him
with
that
gaze
which
penetrates
,
as
*NL*
the
saying
goes
,
to
the
very
depths
of
the
conscience
,
replied
in
a
*NL*
grave
,
firm
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Thenardier
,
one
does
not
require
a
passport
to
travel
five
*NL*
leagues
from
Paris
.
If
I
take
Cosette
away
,
I
shall
take
her
away
,
and
*NL*
that
is
the
end
of
the
matter
.
You
will
not
know
my
name
,
you
will
not
*NL*
know
my
residence
,
you
will
not
know
where
she
is
;
and
my
intention
is
*NL*
that
she
shall
never
set
eyes
on
you
again
so
long
as
she
lives
.
I
break
*NL*
the
thread
which
binds
her
foot
,
and
she
departs
.
Does
that
suit
you
?
*NL*
Yes
or
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Since
geniuses
,
like
demons
,
recognize
the
presence
of
a
superior
God
by
*NL*
certain
signs
,
Thenardier
comprehended
that
he
had
to
deal
with
a
very
*NL*
strong
person
.
It
was
like
an
intuition
;
he
comprehended
it
with
his
*NL*
clear
and
sagacious
promptitude
.
While
drinking
with
the
carters
,
*NL*
smoking
,
and
singing
coarse
songs
on
the
preceding
evening
,
he
had
*NL*
devoted
the
whole
of
the
time
to
observing
the
stranger
,
watching
him
*NL*
like
a
cat
,
and
studying
him
like
a
mathematician
.
He
had
watched
him
,
*NL*
both
on
his
own
account
,
for
the
pleasure
of
the
thing
,
and
through
*NL*
instinct
,
and
had
spied
upon
him
as
though
he
had
been
paid
for
so
*NL*
doing
.
Not
a
movement
,
not
a
gesture
,
on
the
part
of
the
man
in
the
*NL*
yellow
great-coat
had
escaped
him
.
Even
before
the
stranger
had
so
*NL*
clearly
manifested
his
interest
in
Cosette
,
Thenardier
had
divined
his
*NL*
purpose
.
He
had
caught
the
old
man
's
deep
glances
returning
constantly
*NL*
to
the
child
.
Who
was
this
man
?
Why
this
interest
?
Why
this
hideous
*NL*
costume
,
when
he
had
so
much
money
in
his
purse
?
Questions
which
he
put
*NL*
to
himself
without
being
able
to
solve
them
,
and
which
irritated
him
.
He
*NL*
had
pondered
it
all
night
long
.
He
could
not
be
Cosette
's
father
.
Was
he
*NL*
her
grandfather
?
Then
why
not
make
himself
known
at
once
?
When
one
has
*NL*
a
right
,
one
asserts
it
.
This
man
evidently
had
no
right
over
Cosette
.
*NL*
What
was
it
,
then
?
Thenardier
lost
himself
in
conjectures
.
He
caught
*NL*
glimpses
of
everything
,
but
he
saw
nothing
.
Be
that
as
it
may
,
on
*NL*
entering
into
conversation
with
the
man
,
sure
that
there
was
some
secret
*NL*
in
the
case
,
that
the
latter
had
some
interest
in
remaining
in
the
*NL*
shadow
,
he
felt
himself
strong
;
when
he
perceived
from
the
stranger
's
*NL*
clear
and
firm
retort
,
that
this
mysterious
personage
was
mysterious
in
*NL*
so
simple
a
way
,
he
became
conscious
that
he
was
weak
.
He
had
expected
*NL*
nothing
of
the
sort
.
His
conjectures
were
put
to
the
rout
.
He
rallied
*NL*
his
ideas
.
He
weighed
everything
in
the
space
of
a
second
.
Thenardier
*NL*
was
one
of
those
men
who
take
in
a
situation
at
a
glance
.
He
decided
*NL*
that
the
moment
had
arrived
for
proceeding
straightforward
,
and
quickly
*NL*
at
that
.
He
did
as
great
leaders
do
at
the
decisive
moment
,
which
they
*NL*
know
that
they
alone
recognize
;
he
abruptly
unmasked
his
batteries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
am
in
need
of
fifteen
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
took
from
his
side
pocket
an
old
pocketbook
of
black
*NL*
leather
,
opened
it
,
drew
out
three
bank-bills
,
which
he
laid
on
the
*NL*
table
.
Then
he
placed
his
large
thumb
on
the
notes
and
said
to
the
*NL*
inn-keeper
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
fetch
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
taking
place
,
what
had
Cosette
been
doing
?
*NL*
*NL*
On
waking
up
,
Cosette
had
run
to
get
her
shoe
.
In
it
she
had
found
the
*NL*
gold
piece
.
It
was
not
a
Napoleon
;
it
was
one
of
those
perfectly
new
*NL*
twenty-franc
pieces
of
the
Restoration
,
on
whose
effigy
the
little
*NL*
Prussian
queue
had
replaced
the
laurel
wreath
.
Cosette
was
dazzled
.
Her
*NL*
destiny
began
to
intoxicate
her
.
She
did
not
know
what
a
gold
piece
was
;
*NL*
she
had
never
seen
one
;
she
hid
it
quickly
in
her
pocket
,
as
though
*NL*
she
had
stolen
it
.
Still
,
she
felt
that
it
really
was
hers
;
she
guessed
*NL*
whence
her
gift
had
come
,
but
the
joy
which
she
experienced
was
full
of
*NL*
fear
.
She
was
happy
;
above
all
she
was
stupefied
.
Such
magnificent
and
*NL*
beautiful
things
did
not
appear
real
.
The
doll
frightened
her
,
the
*NL*
gold
piece
frightened
her
.
She
trembled
vaguely
in
the
presence
of
this
*NL*
magnificence
.
The
stranger
alone
did
not
frighten
her
.
On
the
contrary
,
*NL*
he
reassured
her
.
Ever
since
the
preceding
evening
,
amid
all
her
*NL*
amazement
,
even
in
her
sleep
,
she
had
been
thinking
in
her
little
*NL*
childish
mind
of
that
man
who
seemed
to
be
so
poor
and
so
sad
,
and
who
*NL*
was
so
rich
and
so
kind
.
Everything
had
changed
for
her
since
she
had
*NL*
met
that
good
man
in
the
forest
.
Cosette
,
less
happy
than
the
most
*NL*
insignificant
swallow
of
heaven
,
had
never
known
what
it
was
to
take
*NL*
refuge
under
a
mother
's
shadow
and
under
a
wing
.
For
the
last
five
*NL*
years
,
that
is
to
say
,
as
far
back
as
her
memory
ran
,
the
poor
child
had
*NL*
shivered
and
trembled
.
She
had
always
been
exposed
completely
naked
*NL*
to
the
sharp
wind
of
adversity
;
now
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
clothed
.
*NL*
Formerly
her
soul
had
seemed
cold
,
now
it
was
warm
.
Cosette
was
no
*NL*
longer
afraid
of
the
Thenardier
.
She
was
no
longer
alone
;
there
was
some
*NL*
one
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastily
set
about
her
regular
morning
duties
.
That
louis
,
which
she
*NL*
had
about
her
,
in
the
very
apron
pocket
whence
the
fifteen-sou
piece
had
*NL*
fallen
on
the
night
before
,
distracted
her
thoughts
.
She
dared
not
touch
*NL*
it
,
but
she
spent
five
minutes
in
gazing
at
it
,
with
her
tongue
hanging
*NL*
out
,
if
the
truth
must
be
told
.
As
she
swept
the
staircase
,
she
paused
,
*NL*
remained
standing
there
motionless
,
forgetful
of
her
broom
and
of
the
*NL*
entire
universe
,
occupied
in
gazing
at
that
star
which
was
blazing
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
her
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
one
of
these
periods
of
contemplation
that
the
Thenardier
*NL*
joined
her
.
She
had
gone
in
search
of
Cosette
at
her
husband
's
orders
.
*NL*
What
was
quite
unprecedented
,
she
neither
struck
her
nor
said
an
*NL*
insulting
word
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
,
''
she
said
,
almost
gently
,
``
come
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
later
Cosette
entered
the
public
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
took
up
the
bundle
which
he
had
brought
and
untied
it
.
This
*NL*
bundle
contained
a
little
woollen
gown
,
an
apron
,
a
fustian
bodice
,
a
*NL*
kerchief
,
a
petticoat
,
woollen
stockings
,
shoes
--
a
complete
outfit
for
a
*NL*
girl
of
seven
years
.
All
was
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
take
these
,
and
go
and
dress
yourself
*NL*
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Daylight
was
appearing
when
those
of
the
inhabitants
of
Montfermeil
who
*NL*
had
begun
to
open
their
doors
beheld
a
poorly
clad
old
man
leading
a
*NL*
little
girl
dressed
in
mourning
,
and
carrying
a
pink
doll
in
her
arms
,
*NL*
pass
along
the
road
to
Paris
.
They
were
going
in
the
direction
of
Livry
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
our
man
and
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
knew
the
man
;
as
Cosette
was
no
longer
in
rags
,
many
did
not
*NL*
recognize
her
.
Cosette
was
going
away
.
With
whom
?
She
did
not
know
.
*NL*
Whither
?
She
knew
not
.
All
that
she
understood
was
that
she
was
leaving
*NL*
the
Thenardier
tavern
behind
her
.
No
one
had
thought
of
bidding
her
*NL*
farewell
,
nor
had
she
thought
of
taking
leave
of
any
one
.
She
was
*NL*
leaving
that
hated
and
hating
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
,
gentle
creature
,
whose
heart
had
been
repressed
up
to
that
hour
!
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
walked
along
gravely
,
with
her
large
eyes
wide
open
,
and
gazing
*NL*
at
the
sky
.
She
had
put
her
louis
in
the
pocket
of
her
new
apron
.
From
*NL*
time
to
time
,
she
bent
down
and
glanced
at
it
;
then
she
looked
at
the
*NL*
good
man
.
She
felt
something
as
though
she
were
beside
the
good
God
.

CHAPTER
X
--
HE
WHO
SEEKS
TO
BETTER
HIMSELF
MAY
RENDER
HIS
SITUATION
WORSE
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
had
allowed
her
husband
to
have
his
own
way
,
as
was
*NL*
her
wont
.
She
had
expected
great
results
.
When
the
man
and
Cosette
had
*NL*
taken
their
departure
,
Thenardier
allowed
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
*NL*
to
elapse
;
then
he
took
her
aside
and
showed
her
the
fifteen
hundred
*NL*
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
since
they
had
set
up
housekeeping
that
she
had
*NL*
dared
to
criticise
one
of
the
master
's
acts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
blow
told
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
in
sooth
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
am
a
fool
.
Give
me
my
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
folded
up
the
three
bank-bills
,
thrust
them
into
his
pocket
,
and
ran
*NL*
out
in
all
haste
;
but
he
made
a
mistake
and
turned
to
the
right
first
.
*NL*
Some
neighbors
,
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
,
put
him
on
the
track
again
;
*NL*
the
Lark
and
the
man
had
been
seen
going
in
the
direction
of
Livry
.
He
*NL*
followed
these
hints
,
walking
with
great
strides
,
and
talking
to
himself
*NL*
the
while
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
is
evidently
a
million
dressed
in
yellow
,
and
I
am
an
animal
.
*NL*
First
he
gave
twenty
sous
,
then
five
francs
,
then
fifty
francs
,
then
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
francs
,
all
with
equal
readiness
.
He
would
have
given
*NL*
fifteen
thousand
francs
.
But
I
shall
overtake
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
that
bundle
of
clothes
prepared
beforehand
for
the
child
;
all
*NL*
that
was
singular
;
many
mysteries
lay
concealed
under
it
.
One
does
not
*NL*
let
mysteries
out
of
one
's
hand
when
one
has
once
grasped
them
.
The
*NL*
secrets
of
the
wealthy
are
sponges
of
gold
;
one
must
know
how
to
subject
*NL*
them
to
pressure
.
All
these
thoughts
whirled
through
his
brain
.
``
I
am
an
*NL*
animal
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
leaves
Montfermeil
and
reaches
the
turn
which
the
road
takes
*NL*
that
runs
to
Livry
,
it
can
be
seen
stretching
out
before
one
to
a
great
*NL*
distance
across
the
plateau
.
On
arriving
there
,
he
calculated
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
be
able
to
see
the
old
man
and
the
child
.
He
looked
as
far
as
*NL*
his
vision
reached
,
and
saw
nothing
.
He
made
fresh
inquiries
,
but
he
had
*NL*
wasted
time
.
Some
passers-by
informed
him
that
the
man
and
child
of
whom
*NL*
he
was
in
search
had
gone
towards
the
forest
in
the
direction
of
Gagny
.
*NL*
He
hastened
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
far
in
advance
of
him
;
but
a
child
walks
slowly
,
and
he
walked
*NL*
fast
;
and
then
,
he
was
well
acquainted
with
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
paused
and
dealt
himself
a
blow
on
his
forehead
like
a
*NL*
man
who
has
forgotten
some
essential
point
and
who
is
ready
to
retrace
*NL*
his
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
have
taken
my
gun
,
''
said
he
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
one
of
those
double
natures
which
sometimes
pass
through
*NL*
our
midst
without
our
being
aware
of
the
fact
,
and
who
disappear
without
*NL*
our
finding
them
out
,
because
destiny
has
only
exhibited
one
side
of
*NL*
them
.
It
is
the
fate
of
many
men
to
live
thus
half
submerged
.
In
a
*NL*
calm
and
even
situation
,
Thenardier
possessed
all
that
is
required
to
*NL*
make
--
we
will
not
say
to
be
--
what
people
have
agreed
to
call
an
honest
*NL*
trader
,
a
good
bourgeois
.
At
the
same
time
certain
circumstances
being
*NL*
given
,
certain
shocks
arriving
to
bring
his
under-nature
to
the
surface
,
*NL*
he
had
all
the
requisites
for
a
blackguard
.
He
was
a
shopkeeper
in
*NL*
whom
there
was
some
taint
of
the
monster
.
Satan
must
have
occasionally
*NL*
crouched
down
in
some
corner
of
the
hovel
in
which
Thenardier
dwelt
,
and
*NL*
have
fallen
a-dreaming
in
the
presence
of
this
hideous
masterpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
momentary
hesitation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
he
thought
;
``
they
will
have
time
to
make
their
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pursued
his
road
,
walking
rapidly
straight
ahead
,
and
with
almost
*NL*
an
air
of
certainty
,
with
the
sagacity
of
a
fox
scenting
a
covey
of
*NL*
partridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
truth
,
when
he
had
passed
the
ponds
and
had
traversed
in
an
oblique
*NL*
direction
the
large
clearing
which
lies
on
the
right
of
the
Avenue
de
*NL*
Bellevue
,
and
reached
that
turf
alley
which
nearly
makes
the
circuit
of
*NL*
the
hill
,
and
covers
the
arch
of
the
ancient
aqueduct
of
the
Abbey
of
*NL*
Chelles
,
he
caught
sight
,
over
the
top
of
the
brushwood
,
of
the
hat
on
*NL*
which
he
had
already
erected
so
many
conjectures
;
it
was
that
man
's
hat
.
*NL*
The
brushwood
was
not
high
.
Thenardier
recognized
the
fact
that
the
man
*NL*
and
Cosette
were
sitting
there
.
The
child
could
not
be
seen
on
account
*NL*
of
her
small
size
,
but
the
head
of
her
doll
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
not
mistaken
.
The
man
was
sitting
there
,
and
letting
*NL*
Cosette
get
somewhat
rested
.
The
inn-keeper
walked
round
the
brushwood
*NL*
and
presented
himself
abruptly
to
the
eyes
of
those
whom
he
was
in
*NL*
search
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
,
excuse
me
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
quite
breathless
,
``
but
here
are
your
*NL*
fifteen
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
he
handed
the
stranger
the
three
bank-bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
raised
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
replied
respectfully
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
,
sir
,
that
I
shall
take
back
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
shuddered
,
and
pressed
close
to
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
,
gazing
to
the
very
bottom
of
Thenardier
's
eyes
the
while
,
*NL*
and
enunciating
every
syllable
distinctly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
go-ing
to
take
back
Co-sette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
I
am
.
I
will
tell
you
;
I
have
considered
the
matter
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
I
have
not
the
right
to
give
her
to
you
.
I
am
an
honest
man
,
you
see
;
*NL*
this
child
does
not
belong
to
me
;
she
belongs
to
her
mother
.
It
was
her
*NL*
mother
who
confided
her
to
me
;
I
can
only
resign
her
to
her
mother
.
You
*NL*
will
say
to
me
,
`
But
her
mother
is
dead
.
'
Good
;
in
that
case
I
can
only
*NL*
give
the
child
up
to
the
person
who
shall
bring
me
a
writing
,
signed
by
*NL*
her
mother
,
to
the
effect
that
I
am
to
hand
the
child
over
to
the
person
*NL*
therein
mentioned
;
that
is
clear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
,
without
making
any
reply
,
fumbled
in
his
pocket
,
and
Thenardier
*NL*
beheld
the
pocket-book
of
bank-bills
make
its
appearance
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tavern-keeper
shivered
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
thought
he
;
``
let
us
hold
firm
;
he
is
going
to
bribe
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
opening
the
pocket-book
,
the
traveller
cast
a
glance
about
him
:
*NL*
the
spot
was
absolutely
deserted
;
there
was
not
a
soul
either
in
the
*NL*
woods
or
in
the
valley
.
The
man
opened
his
pocket-book
once
more
and
*NL*
drew
from
it
,
not
the
handful
of
bills
which
Thenardier
expected
,
but
a
*NL*
simple
little
paper
,
which
he
unfolded
and
presented
fully
open
to
the
*NL*
inn-keeper
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
;
read
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
took
the
paper
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

SUR

25

*NL*
You
will
deliver
Cosette

this
person
.
*NL*
You
will
be
paid
for
all
the
little
things
.
*NL*
I
have
the
honor
to
salute
you
with
respect
,
*NL*
FANTINE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
signature
?
''
resumed
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
was
Fantine
's
signature
;
Thenardier
recognized
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply
to
make
;
he
experienced
two
violent
vexations
,
the
*NL*
vexation
of
renouncing
the
bribery
which
he
had
hoped
for
,
and
the
*NL*
vexation
of
being
beaten
;
the
man
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
keep
this
paper
as
your
receipt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
retreated
in
tolerably
good
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
signature
is
fairly
well
imitated
,
''
he
growled
between
his
teeth
;
*NL*
``
however
,
let
it
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
essayed
a
desperate
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
since
you
are
the
person
,
but
I
must
be
*NL*
paid
for
all
those
little
things
.
A
great
deal
is
owing
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
rose
to
his
feet
,
filliping
the
dust
from
his
thread-bare
*NL*
sleeve
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Thenardier
,
in
January
last
,
the
mother
reckoned
that
she
owed
*NL*
you
one
hundred
and
twenty
francs
.
In
February
,
you
sent
her
a
bill
of
*NL*
five
hundred
francs
;
you
received
three
hundred
francs
at
the
end
of
*NL*
February
,
and
three
hundred
francs
at
the
beginning
of
March
.
Since
then
*NL*
nine
months
have
elapsed
,
at
fifteen
francs
a
month
,
the
price
agreed
*NL*
upon
,
which
makes
one
hundred
and
thirty-five
francs
.
You
had
received
*NL*
one
hundred
francs
too
much
;
that
makes
thirty-five
still
owing
you
.
I
*NL*
have
just
given
you
fifteen
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
's
sensations
were
those
of
the
wolf
at
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
feels
himself
nipped
and
seized
by
the
steel
jaw
of
the
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
devil
of
a
man
?
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
what
the
wolf
does
:
he
shook
himself
.
Audacity
had
succeeded
with
*NL*
him
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur-I-don
`
t-know-your-name
,
''
he
said
resolutely
,
and
this
time
*NL*
casting
aside
all
respectful
ceremony
,
``
I
shall
take
back
Cosette
if
you
*NL*
do
not
give
me
a
thousand
crowns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
said
tranquilly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
Cosette
by
his
left
hand
,
and
with
his
right
he
picked
up
his
*NL*
cudgel
,
which
was
lying
on
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
noted
the
enormous
size
of
the
cudgel
and
the
solitude
of
the
*NL*
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
plunged
into
the
forest
with
the
child
,
leaving
the
inn-keeper
*NL*
motionless
and
speechless
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
walking
away
,
Thenardier
scrutinized
his
huge
shoulders
,
*NL*
which
were
a
little
rounded
,
and
his
great
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
bringing
his
eyes
back
to
his
own
person
,
they
fell
upon
his
*NL*
feeble
arms
and
his
thin
hands
.
``
I
really
must
have
been
exceedingly
*NL*
stupid
not
to
have
thought
to
bring
my
gun
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
since
*NL*
I
was
going
hunting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
inn-keeper
did
not
give
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
know
where
he
is
going
,
''
said
he
,
and
he
set
out
to
follow
*NL*
them
at
a
distance
.
Two
things
were
left
on
his
hands
,
an
irony
in
*NL*
the
shape
of
the
paper
signed
Fantine
,
and
a
consolation
,
the
fifteen
*NL*
hundred
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
led
Cosette
off
in
the
direction
of
Livry
and
Bondy
.
He
walked
*NL*
slowly
,
with
drooping
head
,
in
an
attitude
of
reflection
and
sadness
.
*NL*
The
winter
had
thinned
out
the
forest
,
so
that
Thenardier
did
not
lose
*NL*
them
from
sight
,
although
he
kept
at
a
good
distance
.
The
man
turned
*NL*
round
from
time
to
time
,
and
looked
to
see
if
he
was
being
followed
.
*NL*
All
at
once
he
caught
sight
of
Thenardier
.
He
plunged
suddenly
into
*NL*
the
brushwood
with
Cosette
,
where
they
could
both
hide
themselves
.
``
The
*NL*
deuce
!
''
said
Thenardier
,
and
he
redoubled
his
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thickness
of
the
undergrowth
forced
him
to
draw
nearer
to
them
.
When
*NL*
the
man
had
reached
the
densest
part
of
the
thicket
,
he
wheeled
*NL*
round
.
It
was
in
vain
that
Thenardier
sought
to
conceal
himself
in
the
*NL*
branches
;
he
could
not
prevent
the
man
seeing
him
.
The
man
cast
upon
him
*NL*
an
uneasy
glance
,
then
elevated
his
head
and
continued
his
course
.
The
*NL*
inn-keeper
set
out
again
in
pursuit
.
Thus
they
continued
for
two
or
*NL*
three
hundred
paces
.
All
at
once
the
man
turned
round
once
more
;
he
saw
*NL*
the
inn-keeper
.
This
time
he
gazed
at
him
with
so
sombre
an
air
that
*NL*
Thenardier
decided
that
it
was
``
useless
''
to
proceed
further
.
Thenardier
*NL*
retraced
his
steps
.

REAPPEARS

AND
COSETTE
WINS
IT
IN
THE
LOTTERY
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
not
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
fell
into
the
sea
,
or
rather
,
when
he
threw
himself
into
it
,
he
*NL*
was
not
ironed
,
as
we
have
seen
.
He
swam
under
water
until
he
reached
a
*NL*
vessel
at
anchor
,
to
which
a
boat
was
moored
.
He
found
means
of
hiding
*NL*
himself
in
this
boat
until
night
.
At
night
he
swam
off
again
,
and
*NL*
reached
the
shore
a
little
way
from
Cape
Brun
.
There
,
as
he
did
not
lack
*NL*
money
,
he
procured
clothing
.
A
small
country-house
in
the
neighborhood
*NL*
of
Balaguier
was
at
that
time
the
dressing-room
of
escaped
convicts
,
--
a
*NL*
lucrative
specialty
.
Then
Jean
Valjean
,
like
all
the
sorry
fugitives
*NL*
who
are
seeking
to
evade
the
vigilance
of
the
law
and
social
fatality
,
*NL*
pursued
an
obscure
and
undulating
itinerary
.
He
found
his
first
*NL*
refuge
at
Pradeaux
,
near
Beausset
.
Then
he
directed
his
course
towards
*NL*
Grand-Villard
,
near
Briancon
,
in
the
Hautes-Alpes
.
It
was
a
fumbling
and
*NL*
uneasy
flight
,
--
a
mole
's
track
,
whose
branchings
are
untraceable
.
Later
*NL*
on
,
some
trace
of
his
passage
into
Ain
,
in
the
territory
of
Civrieux
,
*NL*
was
discovered
;
in
the
Pyrenees
,
at
Accons
;
at
the
spot
called
*NL*
Grange-de-Doumec
,
near
the
market
of
Chavailles
,
and
in
the
environs
of
*NL*
Perigueux
at
Brunies
,
canton
of
La
Chapelle-Gonaguet
.
He
reached
Paris
.
*NL*
We
have
just
seen
him
at
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
care
on
arriving
in
Paris
had
been
to
buy
mourning
clothes
*NL*
for
a
little
girl
of
from
seven
to
eight
years
of
age
;
then
to
procure
*NL*
a
lodging
.
That
done
,
he
had
betaken
himself
to
Montfermeil
.
It
will
*NL*
be
remembered
that
already
,
during
his
preceding
escape
,
he
had
made
a
*NL*
mysterious
trip
thither
,
or
somewhere
in
that
neighborhood
,
of
which
the
*NL*
law
had
gathered
an
inkling
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
was
thought
to
be
dead
,
and
this
still
further
increased
the
*NL*
obscurity
which
had
gathered
about
him
.
At
Paris
,
one
of
the
journals
*NL*
which
chronicled
the
fact
fell
into
his
hands
.
He
felt
reassured
and
*NL*
almost
at
peace
,
as
though
he
had
really
been
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
day
when
Jean
Valjean
rescued
Cosette
from
the
*NL*
claws
of
the
Thenardiers
,
he
returned
to
Paris
.
He
re-entered
it
at
*NL*
nightfall
,
with
the
child
,
by
way
of
the
Barrier
Monceaux
.
There
*NL*
he
entered
a
cabriolet
,
which
took
him
to
the
esplanade
of
the
*NL*
Observatoire
.
There
he
got
out

CHAPTER
I
--
MASTER
GORBEAU
*NL*
*NL*
Forty
years
ago
,
a
rambler
who
had
ventured
into
that
unknown
country
of
*NL*
the
Salpetriere
,
and
who
had
mounted
to
the
Barriere
d'Italie
by
way
*NL*
of
the
boulevard
,
reached
a
point
where
it
might
be
said
that
Paris
*NL*
disappeared
.
It
was
no
longer
solitude
,
for
there
were
passers-by
;
it
*NL*
was
not
the
country
,
for
there
were
houses
and
streets
;
it
was
not
the
*NL*
city
,
for
the
streets
had
ruts
like
highways
,
and
the
grass
grew
in
*NL*
them
;
it
was
not
a
village
,
the
houses
were
too
lofty
.
What
was
it
,
*NL*
then
?
It
was
an
inhabited
spot
where
there
was
no
one
;
it
was
a
desert
*NL*
place
where
there
was
some
one
;
it
was
a
boulevard
of
the
great
city
,
a
*NL*
street
of
Paris
;
more
wild
at
night
than
the
forest
,
more
gloomy
by
day
*NL*
than
a
cemetery
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
old
quarter
of
the
Marche-aux-Chevaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rambler
,
if
he
risked
himself
outside
the
four
decrepit
walls
of
*NL*
this
Marche-aux-Chevaux
;
if
he
consented
even
to
pass
beyond
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Petit-Banquier
,
after
leaving
on
his
right
a
garden
protected
by
high
*NL*
walls
;
then
a
field
in
which
tan-bark
mills
rose
like
gigantic
beaver
*NL*
huts
;
then
an
enclosure
encumbered
with
timber
,
with
a
heap
of
stumps
,
*NL*
sawdust
,
and
shavings
,
on
which
stood
a
large
dog
,
barking
;
then
a
long
,
*NL*
low
,
utterly
dilapidated
wall
,
with
a
little
black
door
in
mourning
,
*NL*
laden
with
mosses
,
which
were
covered
with
flowers
in
the
spring
;
then
,
*NL*
in
the
most
deserted
spot
,
a
frightful
and
decrepit
building
,
on
which
*NL*
ran
the
inscription
in
large
letters
:
POST
NO
BILLS
,
--
this
daring
*NL*
rambler
would
have
reached
little
known
latitudes
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Rue
des
Vignes-Saint-Marcel
.
There
,
near
a
factory
,
and
between
two
*NL*
garden
walls
,
there
could
be
seen
,
at
that
epoch
,
a
mean
building
,
*NL*
which
,
at
the
first
glance
,
seemed
as
small
as
a
thatched
hovel
,
and
*NL*
which
was
,
in
reality
,
as
large
as
a
cathedral
.
It
presented
its
side
*NL*
and
gable
to
the
public
road
;
hence
its
apparent
diminutiveness
.
Nearly
*NL*
the
whole
of
the
house
was
hidden
.
Only
the
door
and
one
window
could
be
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
hovel
was
only
one
story
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
detail
that
struck
the
observer
was
,
that
the
door
could
never
*NL*
have
been
anything
but
the
door
of
a
hovel
,
while
the
window
,
if
it
*NL*
had
been
carved
out
of
dressed
stone
instead
of
being
in
rough
masonry
,
*NL*
might
have
been
the
lattice
of
a
lordly
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
nothing
but
a
collection
of
worm-eaten
planks
roughly
bound
*NL*
together
by
cross-beams
which
resembled
roughly
hewn
logs
.
It
*NL*
opened
directly
on
a
steep
staircase
of
lofty
steps
,
muddy
,
chalky
,
*NL*
plaster-stained
,
dusty
steps
,
of
the
same
width
as
itself
,
which
*NL*
could
be
seen
from
the
street
,
running
straight
up
like
a
ladder
and
*NL*
disappearing
in
the
darkness
between
two
walls
.
The
top
of
the
shapeless
*NL*
bay
into
which
this
door
shut
was
masked
by
a
narrow
scantling
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
which
a
triangular
hole
had
been
sawed
,
which
served
both
as
*NL*
wicket
and
air-hole
when
the
door
was
closed
.
On
the
inside
of
the
*NL*
door
the
figures
52
had
been
traced
with
a
couple
of
strokes
of
a
brush
*NL*
dipped
in
ink
,
and
above
the
scantling
the
same
hand
had
daubed
the
*NL*
number
50
,
so
that
one
hesitated
.
Where
was
one
?
Above
the
door
it
said
,
*NL*
``
Number
50
''
;
the
inside
replied
,
``
no
,
Number
52
.
''
No
one
knows
what
*NL*
dust-colored
figures
were
suspended
like
draperies
from
the
triangular
*NL*
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
was
large
,
sufficiently
elevated
,
garnished
with
Venetian
*NL*
blinds
,
and
with
a
frame
in
large
square
panes
;
only
these
large
panes
*NL*
were
suffering
from
various
wounds
,
which
were
both
concealed
and
*NL*
betrayed
by
an
ingenious
paper
bandage
.
And
the
blinds
,
dislocated
and
*NL*
unpasted
,
threatened
passers-by
rather
than
screened
the
occupants
.
*NL*
The
horizontal
slats
were
missing
here
and
there
and
had
been
naively
*NL*
replaced
with
boards
nailed
on
perpendicularly
;
so
that
what
began
as
*NL*
a
blind
ended
as
a
shutter
.
This
door
with
an
unclean
,
and
this
window
*NL*
with
an
honest
though
dilapidated
air
,
thus
beheld
on
the
same
house
,
*NL*
produced
the
effect
of
two
incomplete
beggars
walking
side
by
side
,
*NL*
with
different
miens
beneath
the
same
rags
,
the
one
having
always
been
a
*NL*
mendicant
,
and
the
other
having
once
been
a
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
staircase
led
to
a
very
vast
edifice
which
resembled
a
shed
which
*NL*
had
been
converted
into
a
house
.
This
edifice
had
,
for
its
intestinal
*NL*
tube
,
a
long
corridor
,
on
which
opened
to
right
and
left
sorts
of
*NL*
compartments
of
varied
dimensions
which
were
inhabitable
under
stress
*NL*
of
circumstances
,
and
rather
more
like
stalls
than
cells
.
These
chambers
*NL*
received
their
light
from
the
vague
waste
grounds
in
the
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
dark
,
disagreeable
,
wan
,
melancholy
,
sepulchral
;
traversed
*NL*
according
as
the
crevices
lay
in
the
roof
or
in
the
door
,
by
cold
rays
*NL*
or
by
icy
winds
.
An
interesting
and
picturesque
peculiarity
of
this
sort
*NL*
of
dwelling
is
the
enormous
size
of
the
spiders
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
left
of
the
entrance
door
,
on
the
boulevard
side
,
at
about
the
*NL*
height
of
a
man
from
the
ground
,
a
small
window
which
had
been
walled
up
*NL*
formed
a
square
niche
full
of
stones
which
the
children
had
thrown
there
*NL*
as
they
passed
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
portion
of
this
building
has
recently
been
demolished
.
From
what
still
*NL*
remains
of
it
one
can
form
a
judgment
as
to
what
it
was
in
former
days
.
*NL*
As
a
whole
,
it
was
not
over
a
hundred
years
old
.
A
hundred
years
is
*NL*
youth
in
a
church
and
age
in
a
house
.
It
seems
as
though
man
's
lodging
*NL*
partook
of
his
ephemeral
character
,
and
God
's
house
of
his
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postmen
called
the
house
Number
50-52
;
but
it
was
known
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
as
the
Gorbeau
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
explain
whence
this
appellation
was
derived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Collectors
of
petty
details
,
who
become
herbalists
of
anecdotes
,
and
*NL*
prick
slippery
dates
into
their
memories
with
a
pin
,
know
that
there
*NL*
was
in
Paris
,
during
the
last
century
,
about
1770
,
two
attorneys
at
the
*NL*
Chatelet
named
,
one
Corbeau
-LRB-
Raven
-RRB-
,
the
other
Renard
-LRB-
Fox
-RRB-
.
The
two
*NL*
names
had
been
forestalled
by
La
Fontaine
.
The
opportunity
was
too
fine
*NL*
for
the
lawyers
;
they
made
the
most
of
it
.
A
parody
was
immediately
*NL*
put
in
circulation
in
the
galleries
of
the
court-house
,
in
verses
that
*NL*
limped
a
little
:

cette
histoire
:
*NL*
He

Etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
honest
practitioners
,
embarrassed
by
the
jests
,
and
finding
the
*NL*
bearing
of
their
heads
interfered
with
by
the
shouts
of
laughter
which
*NL*
followed
them
,
resolved
to
get
rid
of
their
names
,
and
hit
upon
the
*NL*
expedient
of
applying
to
the
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
petition
was
presented
to
Louis
XV
.
on
the
same
day
when
the
*NL*
Papal
Nuncio
,
on
the
one
hand
,
and
the
Cardinal
de
la
Roche-Aymon
on
the
*NL*
other
,
both
devoutly
kneeling
,
were
each
engaged
in
putting
on
,
in
his
*NL*
Majesty
's
presence
,
a
slipper
on
the
bare
feet
of
Madame
du
Barry
,
who
*NL*
had
just
got
out
of
bed
.
The
king
,
who
was
laughing
,
continued
to
laugh
,
*NL*
passed
gayly
from
the
two
bishops
to
the
two
lawyers
,
and
bestowed
on
*NL*
these
limbs
of
the
law
their
former
names
,
or
nearly
so
.
By
the
kings
*NL*
command
,
Maitre
Corbeau
was
permitted
to
add
a
tail
to
his
initial
*NL*
letter
and
to
call
himself
Gorbeau
.
Maitre
Renard
was
less
lucky
;
all
he
*NL*
obtained
was
leave
to
place
a
P
in
front
of
his
R
,
and
to
call
himself
*NL*
Prenard
;
so
that
the
second
name
bore
almost
as
much
resemblance
as
the
*NL*
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
according
to
local
tradition
,
this
Maitre
Gorbeau
had
been
the
*NL*
proprietor
of
the
building
numbered
50-52
on
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
.
*NL*
He
was
even
the
author
of
the
monumental
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
edifice
bore
the
name
of
the
Gorbeau
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
this
house
,
among
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
,
rose
a
great
elm
*NL*
which
was
three-quarters
dead
;
almost
directly
facing
it
opens
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Barriere
des
Gobelins
,
a
street
then
without
houses
,
unpaved
,
*NL*
planted
with
unhealthy
trees
,
which
was
green
or
muddy
according
to
the
*NL*
season
,
and
which
ended
squarely
in
the
exterior
wall
of
Paris
.
An
odor
*NL*
of
copperas
issued
in
puffs
from
the
roofs
of
the
neighboring
factory
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barrier
was
close
at
hand
.
In
1823
the
city
wall
was
still
in
*NL*
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
barrier
itself
evoked
gloomy
fancies
in
the
mind
.
It
was
the
*NL*
road
to
Bicetre
.
It
was
through
it
that
,
under
the
Empire
and
the
*NL*
Restoration
,
prisoners
condemned
to
death
re-entered
Paris
on
the
day
*NL*
of
their
execution
.
It
was
there
,
that
,
about
1829
,
was
committed
that
*NL*
mysterious
assassination
,
called
``
The
assassination
of
the
Fontainebleau
*NL*
barrier
,
''
whose
authors
justice
was
never
able
to
discover
;
a
melancholy
*NL*
problem
which
has
never
been
elucidated
,
a
frightful
enigma
which
has
*NL*
never
been
unriddled
.
Take
a
few
steps
,
and
you
come
upon
that
fatal
Rue
*NL*
Croulebarbe
,
where
Ulbach
stabbed
the
goat-girl
of
Ivry
to
the
sound
of
*NL*
thunder
,
as
in
the
melodramas
.
A
few
paces
more
,
and
you
arrive
at
the
*NL*
abominable
pollarded
elms
of
the
Barriere
Saint-Jacques
,
that
expedient
*NL*
of
the
philanthropist
to
conceal
the
scaffold
,
that
miserable
and
*NL*
shameful
Place
de
Grove
of
a
shop-keeping
and
bourgeois
society
,
which
*NL*
recoiled
before
the
death
penalty
,
neither
daring
to
abolish
it
with
*NL*
grandeur
,
nor
to
uphold
it
with
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
aside
this
Place
Saint-Jacques
,
which
was
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
predestined
,
and
which
has
always
been
horrible
,
probably
the
most
*NL*
mournful
spot
on
that
mournful
boulevard
,
seven
and
thirty
years
ago
,
*NL*
was
the
spot
which
even
to-day
is
so
unattractive
,
where
stood
the
*NL*
building
Number
50-52
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bourgeois
houses
only
began
to
spring
up
there
twenty-five
years
later
.
*NL*
The
place
was
unpleasant
.
In
addition
to
the
gloomy
thoughts
which
*NL*
assailed
one
there
,
one
was
conscious
of
being
between
the
Salpetriere
,
*NL*
a
glimpse
of
whose
dome
could
be
seen
,
and
Bicetre
,
whose
outskirts
one
*NL*
was
fairly
touching
;
that
is
to
say
,
between
the
madness
of
women
and
*NL*
the
madness
of
men
.
As
far
as
the
eye
could
see
,
one
could
perceive
*NL*
nothing
but
the
abattoirs
,
the
city
wall
,
and
the
fronts
of
a
few
*NL*
factories
,
resembling
barracks
or
monasteries
;
everywhere
about
stood
*NL*
hovels
,
rubbish
,
ancient
walls
blackened
like
cerecloths
,
new
white
*NL*
walls
like
winding-sheets
;
everywhere
parallel
rows
of
trees
,
buildings
*NL*
erected
on
a
line
,
flat
constructions
,
long
,
cold
rows
,
and
the
*NL*
melancholy
sadness
of
right
angles
.
Not
an
unevenness
of
the
ground
,
*NL*
not
a
caprice
in
the
architecture
,
not
a
fold
.
The
ensemble
was
glacial
,
*NL*
regular
,
hideous
.
Nothing
oppresses
the
heart
like
symmetry
.
It
is
*NL*
because
symmetry
is
ennui
,
and
ennui
is
at
the
very
foundation
of
grief
.
*NL*
Despair
yawns
.
Something
more
terrible
than
a
hell
where
one
suffers
*NL*
may
be
imagined
,
and
that
is
a
hell
where
one
is
bored
.
If
such
a
hell
*NL*
existed
,
that
bit
of
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
might
have
formed
the
*NL*
entrance
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
at
nightfall
,
at
the
moment
when
the
daylight
is
*NL*
vanishing
,
especially
in
winter
,
at
the
hour
when
the
twilight
breeze
*NL*
tears
from
the
elms
their
last
russet
leaves
,
when
the
darkness
is
deep
*NL*
and
starless
,
or
when
the
moon
and
the
wind
are
making
openings
in
the
*NL*
clouds
and
losing
themselves
in
the
shadows
,
this
boulevard
suddenly
*NL*
becomes
frightful
.
The
black
lines
sink
inwards
and
are
lost
in
the
*NL*
shades
,
like
morsels
of
the
infinite
.
The
passer-by
can
not
refrain
from
*NL*
recalling
the
innumerable
traditions
of
the
place
which
are
connected
*NL*
with
the
gibbet
.
The
solitude
of
this
spot
,
where
so
many
crimes
have
*NL*
been
committed
,
had
something
terrible
about
it
.
One
almost
had
a
*NL*
presentiment
of
meeting
with
traps
in
that
darkness
;
all
the
confused
*NL*
forms
of
the
darkness
seemed
suspicious
,
and
the
long
,
hollow
square
,
of
*NL*
which
one
caught
a
glimpse
between
each
tree
,
seemed
graves
:
by
day
it
*NL*
was
ugly
;
in
the
evening
melancholy
;
by
night
it
was
sinister
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
summer
,
at
twilight
,
one
saw
,
here
and
there
,
a
few
old
women
seated
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
elm
,
on
benches
mouldy
with
rain
.
These
good
old
*NL*
women
were
fond
of
begging
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
quarter
,
which
had
a
superannuated
rather
than
an
antique
*NL*
air
,
was
tending
even
then
to
transformation
.
Even
at
that
time
any
one
*NL*
who
was
desirous
of
seeing
it
had
to
make
haste
.
Each
day
some
detail
of
*NL*
the
whole
effect
was
disappearing
.
For
the
last
twenty
years
the
station
*NL*
of
the
Orleans
railway
has
stood
beside
the
old
faubourg
and
distracted
*NL*
it
,
as
it
does
to-day
.
Wherever
it
is
placed
on
the
borders
of
a
*NL*
capital
,
a
railway
station
is
the
death
of
a
suburb
and
the
birth
of
a
*NL*
city
.
It
seems
as
though
,
around
these
great
centres
of
the
movements
of
*NL*
a
people
,
the
earth
,
full
of
germs
,
trembled
and
yawned
,
to
engulf
the
*NL*
ancient
dwellings
of
men
and
to
allow
new
ones
to
spring
forth
,
at
the
*NL*
rattle
of
these
powerful
machines
,
at
the
breath
of
these
monstrous
*NL*
horses
of
civilization
which
devour
coal
and
vomit
fire
.
The
old
houses
*NL*
crumble
and
new
ones
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
Orleans
railway
has
invaded
the
region
of
the
Salpetriere
,
*NL*
the
ancient
,
narrow
streets
which
adjoin
the
moats
Saint-Victor
and
the
*NL*
Jardin
des
Plantes
tremble
,
as
they
are
violently
traversed
three
or
*NL*
four
times
each
day
by
those
currents
of
coach
fiacres
and
omnibuses
*NL*
which
,
in
a
given
time
,
crowd
back
the
houses
to
the
right
and
the
left
;
*NL*
for
there
are
things
which
are
odd
when
said
that
are
rigorously
exact
;
*NL*
and
just
as
it
is
true
to
say
that
in
large
cities
the
sun
makes
the
*NL*
southern
fronts
of
houses
to
vegetate
and
grow
,
it
is
certain
that
the
*NL*
frequent
passage
of
vehicles
enlarges
streets
.
The
symptoms
of
a
new
*NL*
life
are
evident
.
In
this
old
provincial
quarter
,
in
the
wildest
nooks
,
*NL*
the
pavement
shows
itself
,
the
sidewalks
begin
to
crawl
and
to
grow
*NL*
longer
,
even
where
there
are
as
yet
no
pedestrians
.
One
morning
,
--
a
*NL*
memorable
morning
in
July
,
1845
,
--
black
pots
of
bitumen
were
seen
*NL*
smoking
there
;
on
that
day
it
might
be
said
that
civilization
had
*NL*
arrived
in
the
Rue
de
l'Ourcine
,
and
that
Paris
had
entered
the
suburb
*NL*
of
Saint-Marceau
.

CHAPTER
II
--
A
NEST
FOR
OWL
AND
A
WARBLER
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
front
of
this
Gorbeau
house
that
Jean
Valjean
halted
.
Like
*NL*
wild
birds
,
he
had
chosen
this
desert
place
to
construct
his
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
drew
out
a
sort
of
a
pass-key
,
*NL*
opened
the
door
,
entered
,
closed
it
again
carefully
,
and
ascended
the
*NL*
staircase
,
still
carrying
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
top
of
the
stairs
he
drew
from
his
pocket
another
key
,
with
*NL*
which
he
opened
another
door
.
The
chamber
which
he
entered
,
and
which
*NL*
he
closed
again
instantly
,
was
a
kind
of
moderately
spacious
attic
,
*NL*
furnished
with
a
mattress
laid
on
the
floor
,
a
table
,
and
several
*NL*
chairs
;
a
stove
in
which
a
fire
was
burning
,
and
whose
embers
were
*NL*
visible
,
stood
in
one
corner
.
A
lantern
on
the
boulevard
cast
a
vague
*NL*
light
into
this
poor
room
.
At
the
extreme
end
there
was
a
dressing-room
*NL*
with
a
folding
bed
;
Jean
Valjean
carried
the
child
to
this
bed
and
laid
*NL*
her
down
there
without
waking
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
struck
a
match
and
lighted
a
candle
.
All
this
was
prepared
beforehand
*NL*
on
the
table
,
and
,
as
he
had
done
on
the
previous
evening
,
he
began
*NL*
to
scrutinize
Cosette
's
face
with
a
gaze
full
of
ecstasy
,
in
which
the
*NL*
expression
of
kindness
and
tenderness
almost
amounted
to
aberration
.
The
*NL*
little
girl
,
with
that
tranquil
confidence
which
belongs
only
to
extreme
*NL*
strength
and
extreme
weakness
,
had
fallen
asleep
without
knowing
with
*NL*
whom
she
was
,
and
continued
to
sleep
without
knowing
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
bent
down
and
kissed
that
child
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nine
months
before
he
had
kissed
the
hand
of
the
mother
,
who
had
also
*NL*
just
fallen
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
sad
,
piercing
,
religious
sentiment
filled
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
beside
Cosette
's
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
lt
was
broad
daylight
,
and
the
child
still
slept
.
A
wan
ray
of
the
*NL*
December
sun
penetrated
the
window
of
the
attic
and
lay
upon
the
*NL*
ceiling
in
long
threads
of
light
and
shade
.
All
at
once
a
heavily
laden
*NL*
carrier
's
cart
,
which
was
passing
along
the
boulevard
,
shook
the
frail
*NL*
bed
,
like
a
clap
of
thunder
,
and
made
it
quiver
from
top
to
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
madame
!
''
cried
Cosette
,
waking
with
a
start
,
``
here
I
am
!
here
I
*NL*
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
sprang
out
of
bed
,
her
eyes
still
half
shut
with
the
heaviness
*NL*
of
sleep
,
extending
her
arms
towards
the
corner
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
mon
Dieu
,
my
broom
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
eyes
wide
now
,
and
beheld
the
smiling
countenance
of
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
it
is
true
!
''
said
the
child
.
``
Good
morning
,
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Children
accept
joy
and
happiness
instantly
and
familiarly
,
being
*NL*
themselves
by
nature
joy
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
caught
sight
of
Catherine
at
the
foot
of
her
bed
,
and
took
*NL*
possession
of
her
,
and
,
as
she
played
,
she
put
a
hundred
questions
to
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
Where
was
she
?
Was
Paris
very
large
?
Was
Madame
Thenardier
*NL*
very
far
away
?
Was
she
to
go
back
?
etc.
,
etc.
.
All
at
once
she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
How
pretty
it
is
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
frightful
hole
,
but
she
felt
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Must
I
sweep
?
''
she
resumed
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Play
!
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
passed
thus
.
Cosette
,
without
troubling
herself
to
understand
*NL*
anything
,
was
inexpressibly
happy
with
that
doll
and
that
kind
man
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
III
--
TWO
MISFORTUNES
MAKE
ONE
PIECE
OF
GOOD
FORTUNE
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
morning
,
at
daybreak
,
Jean
Valjean
was
still
by
*NL*
Cosette
's
bedside
;
he
watched
there
motionless
,
waiting
for
her
to
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
new
thing
had
come
into
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
never
loved
anything
;
for
twenty-five
years
he
had
been
*NL*
alone
in
the
world
.
He
had
never
been
father
,
lover
,
husband
,
friend
.
In
*NL*
the
prison
he
had
been
vicious
,
gloomy
,
chaste
,
ignorant
,
and
shy
.
*NL*
The
heart
of
that
ex-convict
was
full
of
virginity
.
His
sister
and
his
*NL*
sister
's
children
had
left
him
only
a
vague
and
far-off
memory
which
*NL*
had
finally
almost
completely
vanished
;
he
had
made
every
effort
to
*NL*
find
them
,
and
not
having
been
able
to
find
them
,
he
had
forgotten
them
.
*NL*
Human
nature
is
made
thus
;
the
other
tender
emotions
of
his
youth
,
if
he
*NL*
had
ever
had
any
,
had
fallen
into
an
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
saw
Cosette
,
when
he
had
taken
possession
of
her
,
carried
her
*NL*
off
,
and
delivered
her
,
he
felt
his
heart
moved
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
passion
and
affection
within
him
awoke
,
and
rushed
towards
that
*NL*
child
.
He
approached
the
bed
,
where
she
lay
sleeping
,
and
trembled
with
*NL*
joy
.
He
suffered
all
the
pangs
of
a
mother
,
and
he
knew
not
what
it
*NL*
meant
;
for
that
great
and
singular
movement
of
a
heart
which
begins
to
*NL*
love
is
a
very
obscure
and
a
very
sweet
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
man
,
with
a
perfectly
new
heart
!
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
as
he
was
five
and
fifty
,
and
Cosette
eight
years
of
age
,
all
that
*NL*
might
have
been
love
in
the
whole
course
of
his
life
flowed
together
*NL*
into
a
sort
of
ineffable
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
second
white
apparition
which
he
had
encountered
.
The
Bishop
*NL*
had
caused
the
dawn
of
virtue
to
rise
on
his
horizon
;
Cosette
caused
the
*NL*
dawn
of
love
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
early
days
passed
in
this
dazzled
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
on
her
side
,
had
also
,
unknown
to
herself
,
become
another
*NL*
being
,
poor
little
thing
!
She
was
so
little
when
her
mother
left
her
,
*NL*
that
she
no
longer
remembered
her
.
Like
all
children
,
who
resemble
young
*NL*
shoots
of
the
vine
,
which
cling
to
everything
,
she
had
tried
to
love
;
*NL*
she
had
not
succeeded
.
All
had
repulsed
her
,
--
the
Thenardiers
,
their
*NL*
children
,
other
children
.
She
had
loved
the
dog
,
and
he
had
died
,
after
*NL*
which
nothing
and
nobody
would
have
anything
to
do
with
her
.
It
is
a
sad
*NL*
thing
to
say
,
and
we
have
already
intimated
it
,
that
,
at
eight
years
of
*NL*
age
,
her
heart
was
cold
.
It
was
not
her
fault
;
it
was
not
the
faculty
*NL*
of
loving
that
she
lacked
;
alas
!
it
was
the
possibility
.
Thus
,
from
the
*NL*
very
first
day
,
all
her
sentient
and
thinking
powers
loved
this
kind
*NL*
man
.
She
felt
that
which
she
had
never
felt
before
--
a
sensation
of
*NL*
expansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
no
longer
produced
on
her
the
effect
of
being
old
or
poor
;
she
*NL*
thought
Jean
Valjean
handsome
,
just
as
she
thought
the
hovel
pretty
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
the
effects
of
the
dawn
,
of
childhood
,
of
joy
.
The
novelty
of
*NL*
the
earth
and
of
life
counts
for
something
here
.
Nothing
is
so
charming
*NL*
as
the
coloring
reflection
of
happiness
on
a
garret
.
We
all
have
in
our
*NL*
past
a
delightful
garret
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nature
,
a
difference
of
fifty
years
,
had
set
a
profound
gulf
between
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
and
Cosette
;
destiny
filled
in
this
gulf
.
Destiny
suddenly
*NL*
united
and
wedded
with
its
irresistible
power
these
two
uprooted
*NL*
existences
,
differing
in
age
,
alike
in
sorrow
.
One
,
in
fact
,
completed
*NL*
the
other
.
Cosette
's
instinct
sought
a
father
,
as
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
instinct
sought
a
child
.
To
meet
was
to
find
each
other
.
At
the
*NL*
mysterious
moment
when
their
hands
touched
,
they
were
welded
together
.
*NL*
When
these
two
souls
perceived
each
other
,
they
recognized
each
other
as
*NL*
necessary
to
each
other
,
and
embraced
each
other
closely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
the
words
in
their
most
comprehensive
and
absolute
sense
,
we
*NL*
may
say
that
,
separated
from
every
one
by
the
walls
of
the
tomb
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
the
widower
,
and
Cosette
was
the
orphan
:
this
situation
*NL*
caused
Jean
Valjean
to
become
Cosette
's
father
after
a
celestial
*NL*
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
truth
,
the
mysterious
impression
produced
on
Cosette
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
forest
of
Chelles
by
the
hand
of
Jean
Valjean
grasping
*NL*
hers
in
the
dark
was
not
an
illusion
,
but
a
reality
.
The
entrance
of
*NL*
that
man
into
the
destiny
of
that
child
had
been
the
advent
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Jean
Valjean
had
chosen
his
refuge
well
.
There
he
seemed
*NL*
perfectly
secure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chamber
with
a
dressing-room
,
which
he
occupied
with
Cosette
,
was
*NL*
the
one
whose
window
opened
on
the
boulevard
.
This
being
the
only
window
*NL*
in
the
house
,
no
neighbors
'
glances
were
to
be
feared
from
across
the
*NL*
way
or
at
the
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ground-floor
of
Number
50-52
,
a
sort
of
dilapidated
penthouse
,
*NL*
served
as
a
wagon-house
for
market-gardeners
,
and
no
communication
*NL*
existed
between
it
and
the
first
story
.
It
was
separated
by
the
*NL*
flooring
,
which
had
neither
traps
nor
stairs
,
and
which
formed
the
*NL*
diaphragm
of
the
building
,
as
it
were
.
The
first
story
contained
,
as
we
*NL*
have
said
,
numerous
chambers
and
several
attics
,
only
one
of
which
*NL*
was
occupied
by
the
old
woman
who
took
charge
of
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
housekeeping
;
all
the
rest
was
uninhabited
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
old
woman
,
ornamented
with
the
name
of
the
principal
lodger
,
*NL*
and
in
reality
intrusted
with
the
functions
of
portress
,
who
had
let
*NL*
him
the
lodging
on
Christmas
eve
.
He
had
represented
himself
to
her
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
of
means
who
had
been
ruined
by
Spanish
bonds
,
who
was
coming
*NL*
there
to
live
with
his
little
daughter
.
He
had
paid
her
six
months
in
*NL*
advance
,
and
had
commissioned
the
old
woman
to
furnish
the
chamber
and
*NL*
dressing-room
,
as
we
have
seen
.
It
was
this
good
woman
who
had
lighted
*NL*
the
fire
in
the
stove
,
and
prepared
everything
on
the
evening
of
their
*NL*
arrival
.
*NL*
*NL*
Week
followed
week
;
these
two
beings
led
a
happy
life
in
that
hovel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
laughed
,
chattered
,
and
sang
from
daybreak
.
Children
have
their
*NL*
morning
song
as
well
as
birds
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happened
that
Jean
Valjean
clasped
her
tiny
red
hand
,
all
*NL*
cracked
with
chilblains
,
and
kissed
it
.
The
poor
child
,
who
was
used
*NL*
to
being
beaten
,
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
this
,
and
ran
away
in
*NL*
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
she
became
serious
and
stared
at
her
little
black
gown
.
Cosette
*NL*
was
no
longer
in
rags
;
she
was
in
mourning
.
She
had
emerged
from
misery
,
*NL*
and
she
was
entering
into
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
undertaken
to
teach
her
to
read
.
Sometimes
,
as
he
made
*NL*
the
child
spell
,
he
remembered
that
it
was
with
the
idea
of
doing
evil
*NL*
that
he
had
learned
to
read
in
prison
.
This
idea
had
ended
in
teaching
a
*NL*
child
to
read
.
Then
the
ex-convict
smiled
with
the
pensive
smile
of
the
*NL*
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
in
it
a
premeditation
from
on
high
,
the
will
of
some
one
who
*NL*
was
not
man
,
and
he
became
absorbed
in
revery
.
Good
thoughts
have
their
*NL*
abysses
as
well
as
evil
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
teach
Cosette
to
read
,
and
to
let
her
play
,
this
constituted
nearly
*NL*
the
whole
of
Jean
Valjean
's
existence
.
And
then
he
talked
of
her
mother
,
*NL*
and
he
made
her
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
called
him
father
,
and
knew
no
other
name
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
hours
in
watching
her
dressing
and
undressing
her
doll
,
and
in
*NL*
listening
to
her
prattle
.
Life
,
henceforth
,
appeared
to
him
to
be
full
*NL*
of
interest
;
men
seemed
to
him
good
and
just
;
he
no
longer
reproached
*NL*
any
one
in
thought
;
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
live
to
be
a
very
*NL*
old
man
,
now
that
this
child
loved
him
.
He
saw
a
whole
future
stretching
*NL*
out
before
him
,
illuminated
by
Cosette
as
by
a
charming
light
.
The
best
*NL*
of
us
are
not
exempt
from
egotistical
thoughts
.
At
times
,
he
reflected
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
joy
that
she
would
be
ugly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
only
a
personal
opinion
;
but
,
to
utter
our
whole
thought
,
at
the
*NL*
point
where
Jean
Valjean
had
arrived
when
he
began
to
love
Cosette
,
it
*NL*
is
by
no
means
clear
to
us
that
he
did
not
need
this
encouragement
in
*NL*
order
that
he
might
persevere
in
well-doing
.
He
had
just
viewed
the
*NL*
malice
of
men
and
the
misery
of
society
under
a
new
aspect
--
incomplete
*NL*
aspects
,
which
unfortunately
only
exhibited
one
side
of
the
truth
,
*NL*
the
fate
of
woman
as
summed
up
in
Fantine
,
and
public
authority
as
*NL*
personified
in
Javert
.
He
had
returned
to
prison
,
this
time
for
having
*NL*
done
right
;
he
had
quaffed
fresh
bitterness
;
disgust
and
lassitude
were
*NL*
overpowering
him
;
even
the
memory
of
the
Bishop
probably
suffered
*NL*
a
temporary
eclipse
,
though
sure
to
reappear
later
on
luminous
and
*NL*
triumphant
;
but
,
after
all
,
that
sacred
memory
was
growing
dim
.
*NL*
Who
knows
whether
Jean
Valjean
had
not
been
on
the
eve
of
growing
*NL*
discouraged
and
of
falling
once
more
?
He
loved
and
grew
strong
again
.
*NL*
Alas
!
he
walked
with
no
less
indecision
than
Cosette
.
He
protected
her
,
*NL*
and
she
strengthened
him
.
Thanks
to
him
,
she
could
walk
through
life
;
*NL*
thanks
to
her
,
he
could
continue
in
virtue
.
He
was
that
child
's
stay
,
*NL*
and
she
was
his
prop
.
Oh
,
unfathomable
and
divine
mystery
of
the
*NL*
balances
of
destiny
!

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
REMARKS
OF
THE
PRINCIPAL
TENANT
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
prudent
enough
never
to
go
out
by
day
.
Every
evening
,
*NL*
at
twilight
,
he
walked
for
an
hour
or
two
,
sometimes
alone
,
often
with
*NL*
Cosette
,
seeking
the
most
deserted
side
alleys
of
the
boulevard
,
and
*NL*
entering
churches
at
nightfall
.
He
liked
to
go
to
Saint-Medard
,
which
is
*NL*
the
nearest
church
.
When
he
did
not
take
Cosette
with
him
,
she
remained
*NL*
with
the
old
woman
;
but
the
child
's
delight
was
to
go
out
with
the
good
*NL*
man
.
She
preferred
an
hour
with
him
to
all
her
rapturous
tete-a-tetes
*NL*
with
Catherine
.
He
held
her
hand
as
they
walked
,
and
said
sweet
things
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
turned
out
that
Cosette
was
a
very
gay
little
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
attended
to
the
housekeeping
and
cooking
and
went
to
*NL*
market
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lived
soberly
,
always
having
a
little
fire
,
but
like
people
in
*NL*
very
moderate
circumstances
.
Jean
Valjean
had
made
no
alterations
in
*NL*
the
furniture
as
it
was
the
first
day
;
he
had
merely
had
the
glass
door
*NL*
leading
to
Cosette
's
dressing-room
replaced
by
a
solid
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
wore
his
yellow
coat
,
his
black
breeches
,
and
his
old
hat
.
*NL*
In
the
street
,
he
was
taken
for
a
poor
man
.
It
sometimes
happened
that
*NL*
kind-hearted
women
turned
back
to
bestow
a
sou
on
him
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
accepted
the
sou
with
a
deep
bow
.
It
also
happened
occasionally
that
he
*NL*
encountered
some
poor
wretch
asking
alms
;
then
he
looked
behind
him
*NL*
to
make
sure
that
no
one
was
observing
him
,
stealthily
approached
the
*NL*
unfortunate
man
,
put
a
piece
of
money
into
his
hand
,
often
a
silver
*NL*
coin
,
and
walked
rapidly
away
.
This
had
its
disadvantages
.
He
began
*NL*
to
be
known
in
the
neighborhood
under
the
name
of
the
beggar
who
gives
*NL*
alms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
principal
lodger
,
a
cross-looking
creature
,
who
was
*NL*
thoroughly
permeated
,
so
far
as
her
neighbors
were
concerned
,
with
the
*NL*
inquisitiveness
peculiar
to
envious
persons
,
scrutinized
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
a
great
deal
,
without
his
suspecting
the
fact
.
She
was
a
little
deaf
,
*NL*
which
rendered
her
talkative
.
There
remained
to
her
from
her
past
,
two
*NL*
teeth
,
--
one
above
,
the
other
below
,
--
which
she
was
continually
knocking
*NL*
against
each
other
.
She
had
questioned
Cosette
,
who
had
not
been
able
*NL*
to
tell
her
anything
,
since
she
knew
nothing
herself
except
that
she
had
*NL*
come
from
Montfermeil
.
One
morning
,
this
spy
saw
Jean
Valjean
,
with
*NL*
an
air
which
struck
the
old
gossip
as
peculiar
,
entering
one
of
the
*NL*
uninhabited
compartments
of
the
hovel
.
She
followed
him
with
the
step
*NL*
of
an
old
cat
,
and
was
able
to
observe
him
without
being
seen
,
through
a
*NL*
crack
in
the
door
,
which
was
directly
opposite
him
.
Jean
Valjean
had
his
*NL*
back
turned
towards
this
door
,
by
way
of
greater
security
,
no
doubt
.
The
*NL*
old
woman
saw
him
fumble
in
his
pocket
and
draw
thence
a
case
,
scissors
,
*NL*
and
thread
;
then
he
began
to
rip
the
lining
of
one
of
the
skirts
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
and
from
the
opening
he
took
a
bit
of
yellowish
paper
,
which
he
*NL*
unfolded
.
The
old
woman
recognized
,
with
terror
,
the
fact
that
it
was
*NL*
a
bank-bill
for
a
thousand
francs
.
It
was
the
second
or
third
only
that
*NL*
she
had
seen
in
the
course
of
her
existence
.
She
fled
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
Jean
Valjean
accosted
her
,
and
asked
her
to
go
and
*NL*
get
this
thousand-franc
bill
changed
for
him
,
adding
that
it
was
his
*NL*
quarterly
income
,
which
he
had
received
the
day
before
.
``
Where
?
''
thought
*NL*
the
old
woman
.
``
He
did
not
go
out
until
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
and
*NL*
the
government
bank
certainly
is
not
open
at
that
hour
.
''
The
old
*NL*
woman
went
to
get
the
bill
changed
,
and
mentioned
her
surmises
.
That
*NL*
thousand-franc
note
,
commented
on
and
multiplied
,
produced
a
vast
*NL*
amount
of
terrified
discussion
among
the
gossips
of
the
Rue
des
Vignes
*NL*
Saint-Marcel
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
,
it
chanced
that
Jean
Valjean
was
sawing
some
wood
,
in
*NL*
his
shirt-sleeves
,
in
the
corridor
.
The
old
woman
was
in
the
chamber
,
*NL*
putting
things
in
order
.
She
was
alone
.
Cosette
was
occupied
in
admiring
*NL*
the
wood
as
it
was
sawed
.
The
old
woman
caught
sight
of
the
coat
hanging
*NL*
on
a
nail
,
and
examined
it
.
The
lining
had
been
sewed
up
again
.
The
good
*NL*
woman
felt
of
it
carefully
,
and
thought
she
observed
in
the
skirts
and
*NL*
revers
thicknesses
of
paper
.
More
thousand-franc
bank-bills
,
no
doubt
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
also
noticed
that
there
were
all
sorts
of
things
in
the
pockets
.
*NL*
Not
only
the
needles
,
thread
,
and
scissors
which
she
had
seen
,
but
a
big
*NL*
pocket-book
,
a
very
large
knife
,
and
--
a
suspicious
circumstance
--
several
*NL*
wigs
of
various
colors
.
Each
pocket
of
this
coat
had
the
air
of
being
in
*NL*
a
manner
provided
against
unexpected
accidents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
reached
the
last
days
of
winter
.

CHAPTER
V
--
A
FIVE-FRANC
PIECE
FALLS
ON
THE
GROUND
AND
PRODUCES
A
TUMULT
*NL*
*NL*
Near
Saint-Medard
's
church
there
was
a
poor
man
who
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
crouching
on
the
brink
of
a
public
well
which
had
been
condemned
,
and
*NL*
on
whom
Jean
Valjean
was
fond
of
bestowing
charity
.
He
never
passed
this
*NL*
man
without
giving
him
a
few
sous
.
Sometimes
he
spoke
to
him
.
Those
who
*NL*
envied
this
mendicant
said
that
he
belonged
to
the
police
.
He
was
an
*NL*
ex-beadle
of
seventy-five
,
who
was
constantly
mumbling
his
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
as
Jean
Valjean
was
passing
by
,
when
he
had
not
Cosette
*NL*
with
him
,
he
saw
the
beggar
in
his
usual
place
,
beneath
the
lantern
*NL*
which
had
just
been
lighted
.
The
man
seemed
engaged
in
prayer
,
according
*NL*
to
his
custom
,
and
was
much
bent
over
.
Jean
Valjean
stepped
up
to
him
*NL*
and
placed
his
customary
alms
in
his
hand
.
The
mendicant
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
suddenly
,
stared
intently
at
Jean
Valjean
,
then
dropped
his
head
*NL*
quickly
.
This
movement
was
like
a
flash
of
lightning
.
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
seized
with
a
shudder
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
just
caught
sight
,
*NL*
by
the
light
of
the
street
lantern
,
not
of
the
placid
and
beaming
*NL*
visage
of
the
old
beadle
,
but
of
a
well-known
and
startling
face
.
He
*NL*
experienced
the
same
impression
that
one
would
have
on
finding
one
's
*NL*
self
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
face
to
face
,
in
the
dark
,
with
a
tiger
.
He
*NL*
recoiled
,
terrified
,
petrified
,
daring
neither
to
breathe
,
to
speak
,
*NL*
to
remain
,
nor
to
flee
,
staring
at
the
beggar
who
had
dropped
his
head
,
*NL*
which
was
enveloped
in
a
rag
,
and
no
longer
appeared
to
know
that
he
*NL*
was
there
.
At
this
strange
moment
,
an
instinct
--
possibly
the
mysterious
*NL*
instinct
of
self-preservation
,
--
restrained
Jean
Valjean
from
uttering
a
*NL*
word
.
The
beggar
had
the
same
figure
,
the
same
rags
,
the
same
appearance
*NL*
as
he
had
every
day
.
``
Bah
!
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
am
mad
!
I
am
dreaming
!
*NL*
Impossible
!
''
And
he
returned
profoundly
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hardly
dared
to
confess
,
even
to
himself
,
that
the
face
which
he
*NL*
thought
he
had
seen
was
the
face
of
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
on
thinking
the
matter
over
,
he
regretted
not
having
*NL*
questioned
the
man
,
in
order
to
force
him
to
raise
his
head
a
second
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
at
nightfall
,
he
went
back
.
The
beggar
was
at
his
*NL*
post
.
``
Good
day
,
my
good
man
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
resolutely
,
handing
*NL*
him
a
sou
.
The
beggar
raised
his
head
,
and
replied
in
a
whining
voice
,
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
my
good
sir
.
''
It
was
unmistakably
the
ex-beadle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
felt
completely
reassured
.
He
began
to
laugh
.
``
How
the
*NL*
deuce
could
I
have
thought
that
I
saw
Javert
there
?
''
he
thought
.
``
Am
I
*NL*
going
to
lose
my
eyesight
now
?
''
And
he
thought
no
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
afterwards
,
--
it
might
have
been
at
eight
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
--
he
was
in
his
room
,
and
engaged
in
making
Cosette
spell
aloud
,
*NL*
when
he
heard
the
house
door
open
and
then
shut
again
.
This
struck
him
*NL*
as
singular
.
The
old
woman
,
who
was
the
only
inhabitant
of
the
house
*NL*
except
himself
,
always
went
to
bed
at
nightfall
,
so
that
she
might
not
*NL*
burn
out
her
candles
.
Jean
Valjean
made
a
sign
to
Cosette
to
be
quiet
.
*NL*
He
heard
some
one
ascending
the
stairs
.
It
might
possibly
be
the
old
*NL*
woman
,
who
might
have
fallen
ill
and
have
been
out
to
the
apothecary
's
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
step
was
heavy
,
and
sounded
like
that
of
a
man
;
but
the
old
woman
*NL*
wore
stout
shoes
,
and
there
is
nothing
which
so
strongly
resembles
the
*NL*
step
of
a
man
as
that
of
an
old
woman
.
Nevertheless
,
Jean
Valjean
blew
*NL*
out
his
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
sent
Cosette
to
bed
,
saying
to
her
in
a
low
voice
,
``
Get
into
bed
*NL*
very
softly
''
;
and
as
he
kissed
her
brow
,
the
steps
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
remained
silent
,
motionless
,
with
his
back
towards
the
*NL*
door
,
seated
on
the
chair
from
which
he
had
not
stirred
,
and
holding
his
*NL*
breath
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
expiration
of
a
rather
long
interval
,
he
turned
round
,
as
he
*NL*
heard
nothing
more
,
and
,
as
he
raised
his
eyes
towards
the
door
of
his
*NL*
chamber
,
he
saw
a
light
through
the
keyhole
.
This
light
formed
a
sort
*NL*
of
sinister
star
in
the
blackness
of
the
door
and
the
wall
.
There
was
*NL*
evidently
some
one
there
,
who
was
holding
a
candle
in
his
hand
and
*NL*
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
minutes
elapsed
thus
,
and
the
light
retreated
.
But
he
heard
no
*NL*
sound
of
footsteps
,
which
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
person
who
had
*NL*
been
listening
at
the
door
had
removed
his
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
threw
himself
,
all
dressed
as
he
was
,
on
his
bed
,
and
could
*NL*
not
close
his
eyes
all
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
,
just
as
he
was
falling
into
a
doze
through
fatigue
,
he
was
*NL*
awakened
by
the
creaking
of
a
door
which
opened
on
some
attic
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
corridor
,
then
he
heard
the
same
masculine
footstep
which
had
*NL*
ascended
the
stairs
on
the
preceding
evening
.
The
step
was
approaching
.
*NL*
He
sprang
off
the
bed
and
applied
his
eye
to
the
keyhole
,
which
was
*NL*
tolerably
large
,
hoping
to
see
the
person
who
had
made
his
way
by
night
*NL*
into
the
house
and
had
listened
at
his
door
,
as
he
passed
.
It
was
a
*NL*
man
,
in
fact
,
who
passed
,
this
time
without
pausing
,
in
front
of
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
chamber
.
The
corridor
was
too
dark
to
allow
of
the
person
's
*NL*
face
being
distinguished
;
but
when
the
man
reached
the
staircase
,
a
*NL*
ray
of
light
from
without
made
it
stand
out
like
a
silhouette
,
and
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
had
a
complete
view
of
his
back
.
The
man
was
of
lofty
stature
,
*NL*
clad
in
a
long
frock-coat
,
with
a
cudgel
under
his
arm
.
The
formidable
*NL*
neck
and
shoulders
belonged
to
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
might
have
attempted
to
catch
another
glimpse
of
him
*NL*
through
his
window
opening
on
the
boulevard
,
but
he
would
have
been
*NL*
obliged
to
open
the
window
:
he
dared
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
this
man
had
entered
with
a
key
,
and
like
himself
.
*NL*
Who
had
given
him
that
key
?
What
was
the
meaning
of
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
old
woman
came
to
do
the
work
,
at
seven
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
cast
a
penetrating
glance
on
her
,
but
he
did
not
question
*NL*
her
.
The
good
woman
appeared
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
swept
up
she
remarked
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
Monsieur
may
have
heard
some
one
come
in
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
age
,
and
on
that
boulevard
,
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
was
the
*NL*
dead
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
by
the
way
,
''
he
replied
,
in
the
most
natural
tone
*NL*
possible
.
``
Who
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
new
lodger
who
has
come
into
the
house
,
''
said
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
exactly
;
Dumont
,
or
Daumont
,
or
some
name
of
that
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
is
this
Monsieur
Dumont
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
gazed
at
him
with
her
little
polecat
eyes
,
and
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
gentleman
of
property
,
like
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
had
no
ulterior
meaning
.
Jean
Valjean
thought
he
perceived
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
old
woman
had
taken
her
departure
,
he
did
up
a
hundred
francs
*NL*
which
he
had
in
a
cupboard
,
into
a
roll
,
and
put
it
in
his
pocket
.
In
*NL*
spite
of
all
the
precautions
which
he
took
in
this
operation
so
that
he
*NL*
might
not
be
heard
rattling
silver
,
a
hundred-sou
piece
escaped
from
his
*NL*
hands
and
rolled
noisily
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
darkness
came
on
,
he
descended
and
carefully
scrutinized
both
sides
*NL*
of
the
boulevard
.
He
saw
no
one
.
The
boulevard
appeared
to
be
absolutely
*NL*
deserted
.
It
is
true
that
a
person
can
conceal
himself
behind
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
up
stairs
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
.
''
he
said
to
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
by
the
hand
,
and
they
both
went
out
.

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
ZIGZAGS
OF
STRATEGY
*NL*
*NL*
An
observation
here
becomes
necessary
,
in
view
of
the
pages
which
the
*NL*
reader
is
about
to
peruse
,
and
of
others
which
will
be
met
with
further
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
author
of
this
book
,
who
regrets
the
necessity
of
mentioning
*NL*
himself
,
has
been
absent
from
Paris
for
many
years
.
Paris
has
been
*NL*
transformed
since
he
quitted
it
.
A
new
city
has
arisen
,
which
is
,
after
*NL*
a
fashion
,
unknown
to
him
.
There
is
no
need
for
him
to
say
that
he
loves
*NL*
Paris
:
Paris
is
his
mind
's
natal
city
.
In
consequence
of
demolitions
and
*NL*
reconstructions
,
the
Paris
of
his
youth
,
that
Paris
which
he
bore
away
*NL*
religiously
in
his
memory
,
is
now
a
Paris
of
days
gone
by
.
He
must
*NL*
be
permitted
to
speak
of
that
Paris
as
though
it
still
existed
.
It
is
*NL*
possible
that
when
the
author
conducts
his
readers
to
a
spot
and
says
,
*NL*
``
In
such
a
street
there
stands
such
and
such
a
house
,
''
neither
street
*NL*
nor
house
will
any
longer
exist
in
that
locality
.
Readers
may
verify
*NL*
the
facts
if
they
care
to
take
the
trouble
.
For
his
own
part
,
he
is
*NL*
unacquainted
with
the
new
Paris
,
and
he
writes
with
the
old
Paris
before
*NL*
his
eyes
in
an
illusion
which
is
precious
to
him
.
It
is
a
delight
to
him
*NL*
to
dream
that
there
still
lingers
behind
him
something
of
that
which
he
*NL*
beheld
when
he
was
in
his
own
country
,
and
that
all
has
not
vanished
.
*NL*
So
long
as
you
go
and
come
in
your
native
land
,
you
imagine
that
those
*NL*
streets
are
a
matter
of
indifference
to
you
;
that
those
windows
,
*NL*
those
roofs
,
and
those
doors
are
nothing
to
you
;
that
those
walls
are
*NL*
strangers
to
you
;
that
those
trees
are
merely
the
first
encountered
*NL*
haphazard
;
that
those
houses
,
which
you
do
not
enter
,
are
useless
to
*NL*
you
;
that
the
pavements
which
you
tread
are
merely
stones
.
Later
on
,
*NL*
when
you
are
no
longer
there
,
you
perceive
that
the
streets
are
dear
to
*NL*
you
;
that
you
miss
those
roofs
,
those
doors
;
and
that
those
walls
are
*NL*
necessary
to
you
,
those
trees
are
well
beloved
by
you
;
that
you
entered
*NL*
those
houses
which
you
never
entered
,
every
day
,
and
that
you
have
left
*NL*
a
part
of
your
heart
,
of
your
blood
,
of
your
soul
,
in
those
pavements
.
*NL*
All
those
places
which
you
no
longer
behold
,
which
you
may
never
*NL*
behold
again
,
perchance
,
and
whose
memory
you
have
cherished
,
take
on
*NL*
a
melancholy
charm
,
recur
to
your
mind
with
the
melancholy
of
an
*NL*
apparition
,
make
the
holy
land
visible
to
you
,
and
are
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
the
very
form
of
France
,
and
you
love
them
;
and
you
call
them
up
as
they
*NL*
are
,
as
they
were
,
and
you
persist
in
this
,
and
you
will
submit
to
no
*NL*
change
:
for
you
are
attached
to
the
figure
of
your
fatherland
as
to
the
*NL*
face
of
your
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
we
,
then
,
be
permitted
to
speak
of
the
past
in
the
present
?
That
*NL*
said
,
we
beg
the
reader
to
take
note
of
it
,
and
we
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
instantly
quitted
the
boulevard
and
plunged
into
the
*NL*
streets
,
taking
the
most
intricate
lines
which
he
could
devise
,
*NL*
returning
on
his
track
at
times
,
to
make
sure
that
he
was
not
being
*NL*
followed
.

The
Black
Hunt

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
This
manoeuvre
is
peculiar
to
the
hunted
stag
.
On
soil
where
an
*NL*
imprint
of
the
track
may
be
left
,
this
manoeuvre
possesses
,
among
other
*NL*
advantages
,
that
of
deceiving
the
huntsmen
and
the
dogs
,
by
throwing
*NL*
them
on
the
wrong
scent
.
In
venery
this
is
called
false
re-imbushment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
full
that
night
.
Jean
Valjean
was
not
sorry
for
this
.
The
*NL*
moon
,
still
very
close
to
the
horizon
,
cast
great
masses
of
light
and
*NL*
shadow
in
the
streets
.
Jean
Valjean
could
glide
along
close
to
the
*NL*
houses
on
the
dark
side
,
and
yet
keep
watch
on
the
light
side
.
He
did
*NL*
not
,
perhaps
,
take
sufficiently
into
consideration
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
dark
side
escaped
him
.
Still
,
in
the
deserted
lanes
which
lie
near
the
*NL*
Rue
Poliveau
,
he
thought
he
felt
certain
that
no
one
was
following
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
walked
on
without
asking
any
questions
.
The
sufferings
of
the
*NL*
first
six
years
of
her
life
had
instilled
something
passive
into
her
*NL*
nature
.
Moreover
,
--
and
this
is
a
remark
to
which
we
shall
frequently
*NL*
have
occasion
to
recur
,
--
she
had
grown
used
,
without
being
herself
*NL*
aware
of
it
,
to
the
peculiarities
of
this
good
man
and
to
the
freaks
of
*NL*
destiny
.
And
then
she
was
with
him
,
and
she
felt
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
knew
no
more
where
he
was
going
than
did
Cosette
.
He
*NL*
trusted
in
God
,
as
she
trusted
in
him
.
It
seemed
as
though
he
also
were
*NL*
clinging
to
the
hand
of
some
one
greater
than
himself
;
he
thought
he
*NL*
felt
a
being
leading
him
,
though
invisible
.
However
,
he
had
no
settled
*NL*
idea
,
no
plan
,
no
project
.
He
was
not
even
absolutely
sure
that
it
was
*NL*
Javert
,
and
then
it
might
have
been
Javert
,
without
Javert
knowing
that
*NL*
he
was
Jean
Valjean
.
Was
not
he
disguised
?
Was
not
he
believed
to
be
*NL*
dead
?
Still
,
queer
things
had
been
going
on
for
several
days
.
He
wanted
*NL*
no
more
of
them
.
He
was
determined
not
to
return
to
the
Gorbeau
house
.
*NL*
Like
the
wild
animal
chased
from
its
lair
,
he
was
seeking
a
hole
in
*NL*
which
he
might
hide
until
he
could
find
one
where
he
might
dwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
described
many
and
varied
labyrinths
in
the
Mouffetard
*NL*
quarter
,
which
was
already
asleep
,
as
though
the
discipline
of
the
*NL*
Middle
Ages
and
the
yoke
of
the
curfew
still
existed
;
he
combined
in
*NL*
various
manners
,
with
cunning
strategy
,
the
Rue
Censier
and
the
Rue
*NL*
Copeau
,
the
Rue
du
Battoir-Saint-Victor
and
the
Rue
du
Puits
l'Ermite
.
*NL*
There
are
lodging
houses
in
this
locality
,
but
he
did
not
even
enter
*NL*
one
,
finding
nothing
which
suited
him
.
He
had
no
doubt
that
if
any
one
*NL*
had
chanced
to
be
upon
his
track
,
they
would
have
lost
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
eleven
o'clock
struck
from
Saint-Etienne-du-Mont
,
he
was
traversing
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Pontoise
,
in
front
of
the
office
of
the
commissary
of
police
,
*NL*
situated
at
No.
14
.
A
few
moments
later
,
the
instinct
of
which
we
have
*NL*
spoken
above
made
him
turn
round
.
At
that
moment
he
saw
distinctly
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
commissary
's
lantern
,
which
betrayed
them
,
three
men
*NL*
who
were
following
him
closely
,
pass
,
one
after
the
other
,
under
that
*NL*
lantern
,
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
.
One
of
the
three
entered
the
*NL*
alley
leading
to
the
commissary
's
house
.
The
one
who
marched
at
their
*NL*
head
struck
him
as
decidedly
suspicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
child
,
''
he
said
to
Cosette
;
and
he
made
haste
to
quit
the
Rue
*NL*
Pontoise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
circuit
,
turned
into
the
Passage
des
Patriarches
,
which
was
*NL*
closed
on
account
of
the
hour
,
strode
along
the
Rue
de
l'Epee-de-Bois
*NL*
and
the
Rue
de
l'Arbalete
,
and
plunged
into
the
Rue
des
Postes
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
time
there
was
a
square
formed
by
the
intersection
of
*NL*
streets
,
where
the
College
Rollin
stands
to-day
,
and
where
the
Rue
*NL*
Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve
turns
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
understood
,
of
course
,
that
the
Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve
is
an
*NL*
old
street
,
and
that
a
posting-chaise
does
not
pass
through
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Postes
once
in
ten
years
.
In
the
thirteenth
century
this
Rue
des
Postes
*NL*
was
inhabited
by
potters
,
and
its
real
name
is
Rue
des
Pots
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
cast
a
livid
light
into
this
open
space
.
Jean
Valjean
went
into
*NL*
ambush
in
a
doorway
,
calculating
that
if
the
men
were
still
following
*NL*
him
,
he
could
not
fail
to
get
a
good
look
at
them
,
as
they
traversed
*NL*
this
illuminated
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
point
of
fact
,
three
minutes
had
not
elapsed
when
the
men
made
their
*NL*
appearance
.
There
were
four
of
them
now
.
All
were
tall
,
dressed
in
long
,
*NL*
brown
coats
,
with
round
hats
,
and
huge
cudgels
in
their
hands
.
Their
*NL*
great
stature
and
their
vast
fists
rendered
them
no
less
alarming
*NL*
than
did
their
sinister
stride
through
the
darkness
.
One
would
have
*NL*
pronounced
them
four
spectres
disguised
as
bourgeois
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
in
the
middle
of
the
space
and
formed
a
group
,
like
men
in
*NL*
consultation
.
They
had
an
air
of
indecision
.
The
one
who
appeared
to
be
*NL*
their
leader
turned
round
and
pointed
hastily
with
his
right
hand
in
the
*NL*
direction
which
Jean
Valjean
had
taken
;
another
seemed
to
indicate
the
*NL*
contrary
direction
with
considerable
obstinacy
.
At
the
moment
when
the
*NL*
first
man
wheeled
round
,
the
moon
fell
full
in
his
face
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
recognized
Javert
perfectly
.

*NL*
*NL*
Uncertainty
was
at
an
end
for
Jean
Valjean
:
fortunately
it
still
lasted
*NL*
for
the
men
.
He
took
advantage
of
their
hesitation
.
It
was
time
lost
for
*NL*
them
,
but
gained
for
him
.
He
slipped
from
under
the
gate
where
he
had
*NL*
concealed
himself
,
and
went
down
the
Rue
des
Postes
,
towards
the
region
*NL*
of
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
.
Cosette
was
beginning
to
be
tired
.
He
took
*NL*
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
.
There
were
no
passers-by
,
and
the
*NL*
street
lanterns
had
not
been
lighted
on
account
of
there
being
a
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
redoubled
his
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
strides
he
had
reached
the
Goblet
potteries
,
on
the
front
*NL*
of
which
the
moonlight
rendered
distinctly
legible
the
ancient
*NL*
inscription
:
--

*NL*
A

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
behind
him
the
Rue
de
la
Clef
,
then
the
Fountain
Saint-Victor
,
*NL*
skirted
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
by
the
lower
streets
,
and
reached
the
*NL*
quay
.
There
he
turned
round
.
The
quay
was
deserted
.
The
streets
were
*NL*
deserted
.
There
was
no
one
behind
him
.
He
drew
a
long
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gained
the
Pont
d'Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tolls
were
still
collected
there
at
that
epoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
presented
himself
at
the
toll
office
and
handed
over
a
sou
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
two
sous
,
''
said
the
old
soldier
in
charge
of
the
bridge
.
``
You
are
*NL*
carrying
a
child
who
can
walk
.
Pay
for
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paid
,
vexed
that
his
passage
should
have
aroused
remark
.
Every
flight
*NL*
should
be
an
imperceptible
slipping
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
heavy
cart
was
crossing
the
Seine
at
the
same
time
as
himself
,
and
on
*NL*
its
way
,
like
him
,
to
the
right
bank
.
This
was
of
use
to
him
.
He
could
*NL*
traverse
the
bridge
in
the
shadow
of
the
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
middle
of
the
Bridge
,
Cosette
,
whose
feet
were
benumbed
,
*NL*
wanted
to
walk
.
He
set
her
on
the
ground
and
took
her
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bridge
once
crossed
,
he
perceived
some
timber-yards
on
his
right
.
He
*NL*
directed
his
course
thither
.
In
order
to
reach
them
,
it
was
necessary
to
*NL*
risk
himself
in
a
tolerably
large
unsheltered
and
illuminated
space
.
*NL*
He
did
not
hesitate
.
Those
who
were
on
his
track
had
evidently
lost
the
*NL*
scent
,
and
Jean
Valjean
believed
himself
to
be
out
of
danger
.
Hunted
,
*NL*
yes
;
followed
,
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
street
,
the
Rue
du
Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine
,
opened
out
*NL*
between
two
timber-yards
enclosed
in
walls
.
This
street
was
dark
and
*NL*
narrow
and
seemed
made
expressly
for
him
.
Before
entering
it
he
cast
a
*NL*
glance
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
point
where
he
stood
he
could
see
the
whole
extent
of
the
Pont
*NL*
d'Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
shadows
were
just
entering
on
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
shadows
had
their
backs
turned
to
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
and
were
*NL*
on
their
way
to
the
right
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
shadows
were
the
four
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
shuddered
like
the
wild
beast
which
is
recaptured
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
hope
remained
to
him
;
it
was
,
that
the
men
had
not
,
perhaps
,
stepped
*NL*
on
the
bridge
,
and
had
not
caught
sight
of
him
while
he
was
crossing
the
*NL*
large
illuminated
space
,
holding
Cosette
by
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
case
,
by
plunging
into
the
little
street
before
him
,
he
*NL*
might
escape
,
if
he
could
reach
the
timber-yards
,
the
marshes
,
the
*NL*
market-gardens
,
the
uninhabited
ground
which
was
not
built
upon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
might
commit
himself
to
that
silent
little
*NL*
street
.
He
entered
it
.

CHAPTER
III
--
TO
WIT
,
THE
PLAN
OF
PARIS
IN
1727
*NL*
*NL*
Three
hundred
paces
further
on
,
he
arrived
at
a
point
where
the
street
*NL*
forked
.
It
separated
into
two
streets
,
which
ran
in
a
slanting
line
,
one
*NL*
to
the
right
,
and
the
other
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
before
him
what
resembled
the
two
branches
of
a
Y.
*NL*
Which
should
he
choose
?
He
did
not
hesitate
,
but
took
the
one
on
the
*NL*
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
that
to
the
left
ran
towards
a
suburb
,
that
is
to
say
,
towards
*NL*
inhabited
regions
,
and
the
right
branch
towards
the
open
country
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
towards
deserted
regions
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
they
no
longer
walked
very
fast
.
Cosette
's
pace
retarded
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
up
and
carried
her
again
.
Cosette
laid
her
head
on
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
the
good
man
and
said
not
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
from
time
to
time
and
looked
behind
him
.
He
took
care
to
*NL*
keep
always
on
the
dark
side
of
the
street
.
The
street
was
straight
*NL*
in
his
rear
.
The
first
two
or
three
times
that
he
turned
round
he
saw
*NL*
nothing
;
the
silence
was
profound
,
and
he
continued
his
march
somewhat
*NL*
reassured
.
All
at
once
,
on
turning
round
,
he
thought
he
perceived
in
the
*NL*
portion
of
the
street
which
he
had
just
passed
through
,
far
off
in
the
*NL*
obscurity
,
something
which
was
moving
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rushed
forward
precipitately
rather
than
walked
,
hoping
to
find
some
*NL*
side-street
,
to
make
his
escape
through
it
,
and
thus
to
break
his
scent
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
arrived
at
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
wall
,
however
,
did
not
absolutely
prevent
further
progress
;
it
was
*NL*
a
wall
which
bordered
a
transverse
street
,
in
which
the
one
he
had
taken
*NL*
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
again
,
he
was
obliged
to
come
to
a
decision
;
should
he
go
to
the
*NL*
right
or
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
to
the
right
.
The
fragmentary
lane
was
prolonged
between
*NL*
buildings
which
were
either
sheds
or
barns
,
then
ended
at
a
blind
alley
.
*NL*
The
extremity
of
the
cul-de-sac
was
distinctly
visible
,
--
a
lofty
white
*NL*
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
to
the
left
.
On
that
side
the
lane
was
open
,
and
about
*NL*
two
hundred
paces
further
on
,
ran
into
a
street
of
which
it
was
the
*NL*
affluent
.
On
that
side
lay
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Jean
Valjean
was
meditating
a
turn
to
the
left
,
in
*NL*
an
effort
to
reach
the
street
which
he
saw
at
the
end
of
the
lane
,
he
*NL*
perceived
a
sort
of
motionless
,
black
statue
at
the
corner
of
the
lane
*NL*
and
the
street
towards
which
he
was
on
the
point
of
directing
his
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
one
,
a
man
,
who
had
evidently
just
been
posted
there
,
and
*NL*
who
was
barring
the
passage
and
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
recoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
of
Paris
where
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
,
situated
between
*NL*
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
and
la
Rapee
,
is
one
of
those
which
recent
*NL*
improvements
have
transformed
from
top
to
bottom
,
--
resulting
in
*NL*
disfigurement
according
to
some
,
and
in
a
transfiguration
according
to
*NL*
others
.
The
market-gardens
,
the
timber-yards
,
and
the
old
buildings
*NL*
have
been
effaced
.
To-day
,
there
are
brand-new
,
wide
streets
,
arenas
,
*NL*
circuses
,
hippodromes
,
railway
stations
,
and
a
prison
,
Mazas
,
there
;
*NL*
progress
,
as
the
reader
sees
,
with
its
antidote
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
a
century
ago
,
in
that
ordinary
,
popular
tongue
,
which
is
all
*NL*
compounded
of
traditions
,
which
persists
in
calling
the
Institut
les
*NL*
Quatre-Nations
,
and
the
Opera-Comique
Feydeau
,
the
precise
spot
*NL*
whither
Jean
Valjean
had
arrived
was
called
le
Petit
Picpus
.
The
*NL*
Porte
Saint-Jacques
,
the
Porte
Paris
,
the
Barriere
des
Sergents
,
the
*NL*
Porcherons
,
la
Galiote
,
les
Celestins
,
les
Capucins
,
le
Mail
,
la
Bourbe
,
*NL*
l'Arbre
de
Cracovie
,
la
Petite-Pologne
--
these
are
the
names
of
old
Paris
*NL*
which
survive
amid
the
new
.
The
memory
of
the
populace
hovers
over
these
*NL*
relics
of
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
Le
Petit-Picpus
,
which
,
moreover
,
hardly
ever
had
any
existence
,
and
*NL*
never
was
more
than
the
outline
of
a
quarter
,
had
nearly
the
monkish
*NL*
aspect
of
a
Spanish
town
.
The
roads
were
not
much
paved
;
the
streets
*NL*
were
not
much
built
up
.
With
the
exception
of
the
two
or
three
streets
,
*NL*
of
which
we
shall
presently
speak
,
all
was
wall
and
solitude
there
.
Not
*NL*
a
shop
,
not
a
vehicle
,
hardly
a
candle
lighted
here
and
there
in
the
*NL*
windows
;
all
lights
extinguished
after
ten
o'clock
.
Gardens
,
convents
,
*NL*
timber-yards
,
marshes
;
occasional
lowly
dwellings
and
great
walls
as
*NL*
high
as
the
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
this
quarter
in
the
last
century
.
The
Revolution
snubbed
*NL*
it
soundly
.
The
republican
government
demolished
and
cut
through
it
.
*NL*
Rubbish
shoots
were
established
there
.
Thirty
years
ago
,
this
quarter
*NL*
was
disappearing
under
the
erasing
process
of
new
buildings
.
To-day
,
*NL*
it
has
been
utterly
blotted
out
.
The
Petit-Picpus
,
of
which
no
existing
*NL*
plan
has
preserved
a
trace
,
is
indicated
with
sufficient
clearness
*NL*
in
the
plan
of
1727
,
published
at
Paris
by
Denis
Thierry
,
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
,
opposite
the
Rue
du
Platre
;
and
at
Lyons
,
by
Jean
Girin
,
*NL*
Rue
Merciere
,
at
the
sign
of
Prudence
.
Petit-Picpus
had
,
as
*NL*
we
have
just
mentioned
,
a
Y
of
streets
,
formed
by
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine
,
which
spread
out
in
two
branches
,
taking
on
*NL*
the
left
the
name
of
Little
Picpus
Street
,
and
on
the
right
the
name
of
*NL*
the
Rue
Polonceau
.
The
two
limbs
of
the
Y
were
connected
at
the
apex
*NL*
as
by
a
bar
;
this
bar
was
called
Rue
Droit-Mur
.
The
Rue
Polonceau
ended
*NL*
there
;
Rue
Petit-Picpus
passed
on
,
and
ascended
towards
the
Lenoir
*NL*
market
.
A
person
coming
from
the
Seine
reached
the
extremity
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Polonceau
,
and
had
on
his
right
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
,
turning
abruptly
at
a
*NL*
right
angle
,
in
front
of
him
the
wall
of
that
street
,
and
on
his
right
a
*NL*
truncated
prolongation
of
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
,
which
had
no
issue
and
was
*NL*
called
the
Cul-de-Sac
Genrot
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
here
that
Jean
Valjean
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
just
said
,
on
catching
sight
of
that
black
silhouette
*NL*
standing
on
guard
at
the
angle
of
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
and
the
Rue
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
,
he
recoiled
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
of
it
.
That
phantom
*NL*
was
lying
in
wait
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
for
retreating
was
passed
.
That
which
he
had
perceived
in
*NL*
movement
an
instant
before
,
in
the
distant
darkness
,
was
Javert
and
his
*NL*
squad
without
a
doubt
.
Javert
was
probably
already
at
the
commencement
*NL*
of
the
street
at
whose
end
Jean
Valjean
stood
.
Javert
,
to
all
*NL*
appearances
,
was
acquainted
with
this
little
labyrinth
,
and
had
taken
*NL*
his
precautions
by
sending
one
of
his
men
to
guard
the
exit
.
These
*NL*
surmises
,
which
so
closely
resembled
proofs
,
whirled
suddenly
,
like
a
*NL*
handful
of
dust
caught
up
by
an
unexpected
gust
of
wind
,
through
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
mournful
brain
.
He
examined
the
Cul-de-Sac
Genrot
;
there
he
*NL*
was
cut
off
.
He
examined
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
;
there
stood
a
sentinel
.
*NL*
He
saw
that
black
form
standing
out
in
relief
against
the
white
*NL*
pavement
,
illuminated
by
the
moon
;
to
advance
was
to
fall
into
this
*NL*
man
's
hands
;
to
retreat
was
to
fling
himself
into
Javert
's
arms
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
felt
himself
caught
,
as
in
a
net
,
which
was
slowly
contracting
;
*NL*
he
gazed
heavenward
in
despair
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
GROPINGS
OF
FLIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
understand
what
follows
,
it
is
requisite
to
form
an
exact
*NL*
idea
of
the
Droit-Mur
lane
,
and
,
in
particular
,
of
the
angle
which
one
*NL*
leaves
on
the
left
when
one
emerges
from
the
Rue
Polonceau
into
this
*NL*
lane
.
Droit-Mur
lane
was
almost
entirely
bordered
on
the
right
,
as
far
*NL*
as
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
,
by
houses
of
mean
aspect
;
on
the
left
by
a
*NL*
solitary
building
of
severe
outlines
,
composed
of
numerous
parts
which
*NL*
grew
gradually
higher
by
a
story
or
two
as
they
approached
the
Rue
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
side
;
so
that
this
building
,
which
was
very
lofty
on
the
*NL*
Rue
Petit-Picpus
side
,
was
tolerably
low
on
the
side
adjoining
the
Rue
*NL*
Polonceau
.
There
,
at
the
angle
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
it
descended
to
*NL*
such
a
degree
that
it
consisted
of
merely
a
wall
.
This
wall
did
not
abut
*NL*
directly
on
the
Street
;
it
formed
a
deeply
retreating
niche
,
concealed
*NL*
by
its
two
corners
from
two
observers
who
might
have
been
,
one
in
the
*NL*
Rue
Polonceau
,
the
other
in
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beginning
with
these
angles
of
the
niche
,
the
wall
extended
along
the
*NL*
Rue
Polonceau
as
far
as
a
house
which
bore
the
number
49
,
and
along
the
*NL*
Rue
Droit-Mur
,
where
the
fragment
was
much
shorter
,
as
far
as
the
gloomy
*NL*
building
which
we
have
mentioned
and
whose
gable
it
intersected
,
thus
*NL*
forming
another
retreating
angle
in
the
street
.
This
gable
was
sombre
*NL*
of
aspect
;
only
one
window
was
visible
,
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
two
*NL*
shutters
covered
with
a
sheet
of
zinc
and
kept
constantly
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
state
of
the
places
of
which
we
are
here
giving
a
description
is
*NL*
rigorously
exact
,
and
will
certainly
awaken
a
very
precise
memory
in
the
*NL*
mind
of
old
inhabitants
of
the
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
niche
was
entirely
filled
by
a
thing
which
resembled
a
colossal
*NL*
and
wretched
door
;
it
was
a
vast
,
formless
assemblage
of
perpendicular
*NL*
planks
,
the
upper
ones
being
broader
than
the
lower
,
bound
together
by
*NL*
long
transverse
strips
of
iron
.
At
one
side
there
was
a
carriage
gate
of
*NL*
the
ordinary
dimensions
,
and
which
had
evidently
not
been
cut
more
than
*NL*
fifty
years
previously
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
linden-tree
showed
its
crest
above
the
niche
,
and
the
wall
was
covered
*NL*
with
ivy
on
the
side
of
the
Rue
Polonceau
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
imminent
peril
in
which
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
,
this
sombre
*NL*
building
had
about
it
a
solitary
and
uninhabited
look
which
tempted
him
.
*NL*
He
ran
his
eyes
rapidly
over
it
;
he
said
to
himself
,
that
if
he
could
*NL*
contrive
to
get
inside
it
,
he
might
save
himself
.
First
he
conceived
an
*NL*
idea
,
then
a
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
central
portion
of
the
front
of
this
building
,
on
the
Rue
*NL*
Droit-Mur
side
,
there
were
at
all
the
windows
of
the
different
stories
*NL*
ancient
cistern
pipes
of
lead
.
The
various
branches
of
the
pipes
which
*NL*
led
from
one
central
pipe
to
all
these
little
basins
sketched
out
a
sort
*NL*
of
tree
on
the
front
.
These
ramifications
of
pipes
with
their
hundred
*NL*
elbows
imitated
those
old
leafless
vine-stocks
which
writhe
over
the
*NL*
fronts
of
old
farm-houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
odd
espalier
,
with
its
branches
of
lead
and
iron
,
was
the
first
*NL*
thing
that
struck
Jean
Valjean
.
He
seated
Cosette
with
her
back
against
*NL*
a
stone
post
,
with
an
injunction
to
be
silent
,
and
ran
to
the
spot
where
*NL*
the
conduit
touched
the
pavement
.
Perhaps
there
was
some
way
of
climbing
*NL*
up
by
it
and
entering
the
house
.
But
the
pipe
was
dilapidated
and
past
*NL*
service
,
and
hardly
hung
to
its
fastenings
.
Moreover
,
all
the
windows
*NL*
of
this
silent
dwelling
were
grated
with
heavy
iron
bars
,
even
the
attic
*NL*
windows
in
the
roof
.
And
then
,
the
moon
fell
full
upon
that
facade
,
and
*NL*
the
man
who
was
watching
at
the
corner
of
the
street
would
have
seen
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
in
the
act
of
climbing
.
And
finally
,
what
was
to
be
done
*NL*
with
Cosette
?
How
was
she
to
be
drawn
up
to
the
top
of
a
three-story
*NL*
house
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
up
all
idea
of
climbing
by
means
of
the
drain-pipe
,
and
crawled
*NL*
along
the
wall
to
get
back
into
the
Rue
Polonceau
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
slant
of
the
wall
where
he
had
left
Cosette
,
he
*NL*
noticed
that
no
one
could
see
him
there
.
As
we
have
just
explained
,
he
*NL*
was
concealed
from
all
eyes
,
no
matter
from
which
direction
they
were
*NL*
approaching
;
besides
this
,
he
was
in
the
shadow
.
Finally
,
there
were
*NL*
two
doors
;
perhaps
they
might
be
forced
.
The
wall
above
which
he
saw
the
*NL*
linden-tree
and
the
ivy
evidently
abutted
on
a
garden
where
he
could
,
at
*NL*
least
,
hide
himself
,
although
there
were
as
yet
no
leaves
on
the
trees
,
*NL*
and
spend
the
remainder
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Time
was
passing
;
he
must
act
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
over
the
carriage
door
,
and
immediately
recognized
the
fact
that
*NL*
it
was
impracticable
outside
and
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
other
door
with
more
hope
;
it
was
frightfully
*NL*
decrepit
;
its
very
immensity
rendered
it
less
solid
;
the
planks
were
*NL*
rotten
;
the
iron
bands
--
there
were
only
three
of
them
--
were
rusted
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
though
it
might
be
possible
to
pierce
this
worm-eaten
barrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
examining
it
he
found
that
the
door
was
not
a
door
;
it
had
neither
*NL*
hinges
,
cross-bars
,
lock
,
nor
fissure
in
the
middle
;
the
iron
bands
*NL*
traversed
it
from
side
to
side
without
any
break
.
Through
the
crevices
*NL*
in
the
planks
he
caught
a
view
of
unhewn
slabs
and
blocks
of
stone
*NL*
roughly
cemented
together
,
which
passers-by
might
still
have
seen
there
*NL*
ten
years
ago
.
He
was
forced
to
acknowledge
with
consternation
that
this
*NL*
apparent
door
was
simply
the
wooden
decoration
of
a
building
against
*NL*
which
it
was
placed
.
It
was
easy
to
tear
off
a
plank
;
but
then
,
one
*NL*
found
one
's
self
face
to
face
with
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
--
WHICH
WOULD
BE
IMPOSSIBLE
WITH
GAS
LANTERNS
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
heavy
and
measured
sound
began
to
be
audible
at
some
*NL*
distance
.
Jean
Valjean
risked
a
glance
round
the
corner
of
the
street
.
*NL*
Seven
or
eight
soldiers
,
drawn
up
in
a
platoon
,
had
just
debouched
*NL*
into
the
Rue
Polonceau
.
He
saw
the
gleam
of
their
bayonets
.
They
were
*NL*
advancing
towards
him
;
these
soldiers
,
at
whose
head
he
distinguished
*NL*
Javert
's
tall
figure
,
advanced
slowly
and
cautiously
.
They
halted
*NL*
frequently
;
it
was
plain
that
they
were
searching
all
the
nooks
of
the
*NL*
walls
and
all
the
embrasures
of
the
doors
and
alleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
some
patrol
that
Javert
had
encountered
--
there
could
be
no
*NL*
mistake
as
to
this
surmise
--
and
whose
aid
he
had
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
's
two
acolytes
were
marching
in
their
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
rate
at
which
they
were
marching
,
and
in
consideration
of
the
*NL*
halts
which
they
were
making
,
it
would
take
them
about
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
to
reach
the
spot
where
Jean
Valjean
stood
.
It
was
a
frightful
*NL*
moment
.
A
few
minutes
only
separated
Jean
Valjean
from
that
terrible
*NL*
precipice
which
yawned
before
him
for
the
third
time
.
And
the
galleys
*NL*
now
meant
not
only
the
galleys
,
but
Cosette
lost
to
him
forever
;
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
a
life
resembling
the
interior
of
a
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
thing
which
was
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
this
peculiarity
,
that
he
carried
,
as
one
might
say
,
*NL*
two
beggar
's
pouches
:
in
one
he
kept
his
saintly
thoughts
;
in
the
other
*NL*
the
redoubtable
talents
of
a
convict
.
He
rummaged
in
the
one
or
the
*NL*
other
,
according
to
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
his
other
resources
,
thanks
to
his
numerous
escapes
from
the
*NL*
prison
at
Toulon
,
he
was
,
as
it
will
be
remembered
,
a
past
master
in
the
*NL*
incredible
art
of
crawling
up
without
ladder
or
climbing-irons
,
by
sheer
*NL*
muscular
force
,
by
leaning
on
the
nape
of
his
neck
,
his
shoulders
,
his
*NL*
hips
,
and
his
knees
,
by
helping
himself
on
the
rare
projections
of
the
*NL*
stone
,
in
the
right
angle
of
a
wall
,
as
high
as
the
sixth
story
,
if
need
*NL*
be
;
an
art
which
has
rendered
so
celebrated
and
so
alarming
that
corner
*NL*
of
the
wall
of
the
Conciergerie
of
Paris
by
which
Battemolle
,
condemned
*NL*
to
death
,
made
his
escape
twenty
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
measured
with
his
eyes
the
wall
above
which
he
espied
the
*NL*
linden
;
it
was
about
eighteen
feet
in
height
.
The
angle
which
it
formed
*NL*
with
the
gable
of
the
large
building
was
filled
,
at
its
lower
extremity
,
*NL*
by
a
mass
of
masonry
of
a
triangular
shape
,
probably
intended
to
*NL*
preserve
that
too
convenient
corner
from
the
rubbish
of
those
dirty
*NL*
creatures
called
the
passers-by
.
This
practice
of
filling
up
corners
of
*NL*
the
wall
is
much
in
use
in
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mass
was
about
five
feet
in
height
;
the
space
above
the
summit
of
*NL*
this
mass
which
it
was
necessary
to
climb
was
not
more
than
fourteen
*NL*
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wall
was
surmounted
by
a
flat
stone
without
a
coping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
the
difficulty
,
for
she
did
not
know
how
to
climb
a
wall
.
*NL*
Should
he
abandon
her
?
Jean
Valjean
did
not
once
think
of
that
.
It
*NL*
was
impossible
to
carry
her
.
A
man
's
whole
strength
is
required
to
*NL*
successfully
carry
out
these
singular
ascents
.
The
least
burden
would
*NL*
disturb
his
centre
of
gravity
and
pull
him
downwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rope
would
have
been
required
;
Jean
Valjean
had
none
.
Where
was
he
to
*NL*
get
a
rope
at
midnight
,
in
the
Rue
Polonceau
?
Certainly
,
if
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
had
had
a
kingdom
,
he
would
have
given
it
for
a
rope
at
that
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
extreme
situations
have
their
lightning
flashes
which
sometimes
*NL*
dazzle
,
sometimes
illuminate
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
despairing
glance
fell
on
the
street
lantern-post
of
the
*NL*
blind
alley
Genrot
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
there
were
no
gas-jets
in
the
streets
of
Paris
.
At
*NL*
nightfall
lanterns
placed
at
regular
distances
were
lighted
;
they
were
*NL*
ascended
and
descended
by
means
of
a
rope
,
which
traversed
the
street
*NL*
from
side
to
side
,
and
was
adjusted
in
a
groove
of
the
post
.
The
pulley
*NL*
over
which
this
rope
ran
was
fastened
underneath
the
lantern
in
a
little
*NL*
iron
box
,
the
key
to
which
was
kept
by
the
lamp-lighter
,
and
the
rope
*NL*
itself
was
protected
by
a
metal
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
with
the
energy
of
a
supreme
struggle
,
crossed
the
street
*NL*
at
one
bound
,
entered
the
blind
alley
,
broke
the
latch
of
the
little
box
*NL*
with
the
point
of
his
knife
,
and
an
instant
later
he
was
beside
Cosette
*NL*
once
more
.
He
had
a
rope
.
These
gloomy
inventors
of
expedients
work
*NL*
rapidly
when
they
are
fighting
against
fatality
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
explained
that
the
lanterns
had
not
been
lighted
that
*NL*
night
.
The
lantern
in
the
Cul-de-Sac
Genrot
was
thus
naturally
extinct
,
*NL*
like
the
rest
;
and
one
could
pass
directly
under
it
without
even
*NL*
noticing
that
it
was
no
longer
in
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
the
hour
,
the
place
,
the
darkness
,
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
absorption
,
his
singular
gestures
,
his
goings
and
comings
,
all
had
begun
*NL*
to
render
Cosette
uneasy
.
Any
other
child
than
she
would
have
given
vent
*NL*
to
loud
shrieks
long
before
.
She
contented
herself
with
plucking
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
by
the
skirt
of
his
coat
.
They
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
*NL*
patrol
's
approach
ever
more
and
more
distinctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
said
she
,
in
a
very
low
voice
,
``
I
am
afraid
.
Who
is
coming
*NL*
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
replied
the
unhappy
man
;
``
it
is
Madame
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
shuddered
.
He
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
nothing
.
Do
n't
interfere
with
me
.
If
you
cry
out
,
if
you
weep
,
the
*NL*
Thenardier
is
lying
in
wait
for
you
.
She
is
coming
to
take
you
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
without
haste
,
but
without
making
a
useless
movement
,
with
firm
*NL*
and
curt
precision
,
the
more
remarkable
at
a
moment
when
the
patrol
and
*NL*
Javert
might
come
upon
him
at
any
moment
,
he
undid
his
cravat
,
passed
it
*NL*
round
Cosette
's
body
under
the
armpits
,
taking
care
that
it
should
not
*NL*
hurt
the
child
,
fastened
this
cravat
to
one
end
of
the
rope
,
by
means
of
*NL*
that
knot
which
seafaring
men
call
a
``
swallow
knot
,
''
took
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
rope
in
his
teeth
,
pulled
off
his
shoes
and
stockings
,
which
*NL*
he
threw
over
the
wall
,
stepped
upon
the
mass
of
masonry
,
and
began
*NL*
to
raise
himself
in
the
angle
of
the
wall
and
the
gable
with
as
much
*NL*
solidity
and
certainty
as
though
he
had
the
rounds
of
a
ladder
under
his
*NL*
feet
and
elbows
.
Half
a
minute
had
not
elapsed
when
he
was
resting
on
*NL*
his
knees
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
gazed
at
him
in
stupid
amazement
,
without
uttering
a
word
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
injunction
,
and
the
name
of
Madame
Thenardier
,
had
chilled
her
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
heard
Jean
Valjean
's
voice
crying
to
her
,
though
in
a
*NL*
very
low
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
your
back
against
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
a
word
,
and
do
n't
be
alarmed
,
''
went
on
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
felt
herself
lifted
from
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
she
had
time
to
recover
herself
,
she
was
on
the
top
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
grasped
her
,
put
her
on
his
back
,
took
her
two
tiny
hands
*NL*
in
his
large
left
hand
,
lay
down
flat
on
his
stomach
and
crawled
along
*NL*
on
top
of
the
wall
as
far
as
the
cant
.
As
he
had
guessed
,
there
stood
*NL*
a
building
whose
roof
started
from
the
top
of
the
wooden
barricade
and
*NL*
descended
to
within
a
very
short
distance
of
the
ground
,
with
a
gentle
*NL*
slope
which
grazed
the
linden-tree
.
A
lucky
circumstance
,
for
the
wall
*NL*
was
much
higher
on
this
side
than
on
the
street
side
.
Jean
Valjean
could
*NL*
only
see
the
ground
at
a
great
depth
below
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
reached
the
slope
of
the
roof
,
and
had
not
yet
left
the
*NL*
crest
of
the
wall
,
when
a
violent
uproar
announced
the
arrival
of
the
*NL*
patrol
.
The
thundering
voice
of
Javert
was
audible
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Search
the
blind
alley
!
The
Rue
Droit-Mur
is
guarded
!
so
is
the
Rue
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
.
I
'll
answer
for
it
that
he
is
in
the
blind
alley
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
rushed
into
the
Genrot
alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
allowed
himself
to
slide
down
the
roof
,
still
holding
fast
*NL*
to
Cosette
,
reached
the
linden-tree
,
and
leaped
to
the
ground
.
Whether
*NL*
from
terror
or
courage
,
Cosette
had
not
breathed
a
sound
,
though
her
*NL*
hands
were
a
little
abraded
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
BEGINNING
OF
AN
ENIGMA
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
in
a
sort
of
garden
which
was
very
vast
and
*NL*
of
singular
aspect
;
one
of
those
melancholy
gardens
which
seem
made
to
*NL*
be
looked
at
in
winter
and
at
night
.
This
garden
was
oblong
in
shape
,
*NL*
with
an
alley
of
large
poplars
at
the
further
end
,
tolerably
tall
forest
*NL*
trees
in
the
corners
,
and
an
unshaded
space
in
the
centre
,
where
could
*NL*
be
seen
a
very
large
,
solitary
tree
,
then
several
fruit-trees
,
gnarled
*NL*
and
bristling
like
bushes
,
beds
of
vegetables
,
a
melon
patch
,
whose
*NL*
glass
frames
sparkled
in
the
moonlight
,
and
an
old
well
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
stood
stone
benches
which
seemed
black
with
moss
.
The
alleys
were
*NL*
bordered
with
gloomy
and
very
erect
little
shrubs
.
The
grass
had
half
*NL*
taken
possession
of
them
,
and
a
green
mould
covered
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
beside
him
the
building
whose
roof
had
served
him
as
*NL*
a
means
of
descent
,
a
pile
of
fagots
,
and
,
behind
the
fagots
,
directly
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
a
stone
statue
,
whose
mutilated
face
was
no
longer
*NL*
anything
more
than
a
shapeless
mask
which
loomed
vaguely
through
the
*NL*
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
building
was
a
sort
of
ruin
,
where
dismantled
chambers
were
*NL*
distinguishable
,
one
of
which
,
much
encumbered
,
seemed
to
serve
as
a
*NL*
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
large
building
of
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
,
which
had
a
wing
on
the
Rue
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
,
turned
two
facades
,
at
right
angles
,
towards
this
garden
.
*NL*
These
interior
facades
were
even
more
tragic
than
the
exterior
.
All
*NL*
the
windows
were
grated
.
Not
a
gleam
of
light
was
visible
at
any
one
of
*NL*
them
.
The
upper
story
had
scuttles
like
prisons
.
One
of
those
facades
*NL*
cast
its
shadow
on
the
other
,
which
fell
over
the
garden
like
an
immense
*NL*
black
pall
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
other
house
was
visible
.
The
bottom
of
the
garden
was
lost
in
mist
*NL*
and
darkness
.
Nevertheless
,
walls
could
be
confusedly
made
out
,
which
*NL*
intersected
as
though
there
were
more
cultivated
land
beyond
,
and
the
*NL*
low
roofs
of
the
Rue
Polonceau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
more
wild
and
solitary
than
this
garden
could
be
imagined
.
There
*NL*
was
no
one
in
it
,
which
was
quite
natural
in
view
of
the
hour
;
but
it
*NL*
did
not
seem
as
though
this
spot
were
made
for
any
one
to
walk
in
,
even
*NL*
in
broad
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
first
care
had
been
to
get
hold
of
his
shoes
and
put
them
*NL*
on
again
,
then
to
step
under
the
shed
with
Cosette
.
A
man
who
is
fleeing
*NL*
never
thinks
himself
sufficiently
hidden
.
The
child
,
whose
thoughts
were
*NL*
still
on
the
Thenardier
,
shared
his
instinct
for
withdrawing
from
sight
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
trembled
and
pressed
close
to
him
.
They
heard
the
tumultuous
*NL*
noise
of
the
patrol
searching
the
blind
alley
and
the
streets
;
the
blows
*NL*
of
their
gun-stocks
against
the
stones
;
Javert
's
appeals
to
the
police
*NL*
spies
whom
he
had
posted
,
and
his
imprecations
mingled
with
words
which
*NL*
could
not
be
distinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
it
seemed
as
though
that
*NL*
species
of
stormy
roar
were
becoming
more
distant
.
Jean
Valjean
held
his
*NL*
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
laid
his
hand
lightly
on
Cosette
's
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
solitude
in
which
he
stood
was
so
strangely
calm
,
that
this
*NL*
frightful
uproar
,
close
and
furious
as
it
was
,
did
not
disturb
him
by
so
*NL*
much
as
the
shadow
of
a
misgiving
.
It
seemed
as
though
those
walls
had
*NL*
been
built
of
the
deaf
stones
of
which
the
Scriptures
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
in
the
midst
of
this
profound
calm
,
a
fresh
sound
arose
;
a
*NL*
sound
as
celestial
,
divine
,
ineffable
,
ravishing
,
as
the
other
had
been
*NL*
horrible
.
It
was
a
hymn
which
issued
from
the
gloom
,
a
dazzling
burst
*NL*
of
prayer
and
harmony
in
the
obscure
and
alarming
silence
of
the
night
;
*NL*
women
's
voices
,
but
voices
composed
at
one
and
the
same
time
of
the
pure
*NL*
accents
of
virgins
and
the
innocent
accents
of
children
,
--
voices
which
*NL*
are
not
of
the
earth
,
and
which
resemble
those
that
the
newborn
infant
*NL*
still
hears
,
and
which
the
dying
man
hears
already
.
This
song
proceeded
*NL*
from
the
gloomy
edifice
which
towered
above
the
garden
.
At
the
moment
*NL*
when
the
hubbub
of
demons
retreated
,
one
would
have
said
that
a
choir
of
*NL*
angels
was
approaching
through
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
Jean
Valjean
fell
on
their
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
knew
not
what
it
was
,
they
knew
not
where
they
were
;
but
both
of
*NL*
them
,
the
man
and
the
child
,
the
penitent
and
the
innocent
,
felt
that
*NL*
they
must
kneel
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
voices
had
this
strange
characteristic
,
that
they
did
not
prevent
*NL*
the
building
from
seeming
to
be
deserted
.
It
was
a
supernatural
chant
in
*NL*
an
uninhabited
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
voices
were
singing
,
Jean
Valjean
thought
of
nothing
.
He
no
*NL*
longer
beheld
the
night
;
he
beheld
a
blue
sky
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
*NL*
felt
those
wings
which
we
all
have
within
us
,
unfolding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
song
died
away
.
It
may
have
lasted
a
long
time
.
Jean
Valjean
could
*NL*
not
have
told
.
Hours
of
ecstasy
are
never
more
than
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
fell
silent
again
.
There
was
no
longer
anything
in
the
street
;
*NL*
there
was
nothing
in
the
garden
.
That
which
had
menaced
,
that
which
had
*NL*
reassured
him
,
--
all
had
vanished
.
The
breeze
swayed
a
few
dry
weeds
*NL*
on
the
crest
of
the
wall
,
and
they
gave
out
a
faint
,
sweet
,
melancholy
*NL*
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VII
--
CONTINUATION
OF
THE
ENIGMA
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
wind
had
risen
,
which
indicated
that
it
must
be
between
one
*NL*
and
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
Poor
Cosette
said
nothing
.
As
she
had
*NL*
seated
herself
beside
him
and
leaned
her
head
against
him
,
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
had
fancied
that
she
was
asleep
.
He
bent
down
and
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
Cosette
's
eyes
were
wide
open
,
and
her
thoughtful
air
pained
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sleepy
?
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
cold
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
she
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
still
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
already
forgotten
the
means
which
he
had
employed
to
*NL*
make
Cosette
keep
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
he
,
``
she
is
gone
.
You
need
fear
nothing
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
sighed
as
though
a
load
had
been
lifted
from
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ground
was
damp
,
the
shed
open
on
all
sides
,
the
breeze
grew
more
*NL*
keen
every
instant
.
The
goodman
took
off
his
coat
and
wrapped
it
round
*NL*
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
less
cold
now
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
wait
for
me
a
moment
.
I
will
soon
be
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
quitted
the
ruin
and
crept
along
the
large
building
,
seeking
a
better
*NL*
shelter
.
He
came
across
doors
,
but
they
were
closed
.
There
were
bars
at
*NL*
all
the
windows
of
the
ground
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
after
he
had
turned
the
inner
angle
of
the
edifice
,
he
observed
*NL*
that
he
was
coming
to
some
arched
windows
,
where
he
perceived
a
light
.
*NL*
He
stood
on
tiptoe
and
peeped
through
one
of
these
windows
.
They
all
*NL*
opened
on
a
tolerably
vast
hall
,
paved
with
large
flagstones
,
cut
up
*NL*
by
arcades
and
pillars
,
where
only
a
tiny
light
and
great
shadows
were
*NL*
visible
.
The
light
came
from
a
taper
which
was
burning
in
one
*NL*
corner
.
The
apartment
was
deserted
,
and
nothing
was
stirring
in
it
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
by
dint
of
gazing
intently
he
thought
he
perceived
on
the
*NL*
ground
something
which
appeared
to
be
covered
with
a
winding-sheet
,
and
*NL*
which
resembled
a
human
form
.
This
form
was
lying
face
downward
,
flat
*NL*
on
the
pavement
,
with
the
arms
extended
in
the
form
of
a
cross
,
in
the
*NL*
immobility
of
death
.
One
would
have
said
,
judging
from
a
sort
of
serpent
*NL*
which
undulated
over
the
floor
,
that
this
sinister
form
had
a
rope
round
*NL*
its
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
chamber
was
bathed
in
that
mist
of
places
which
are
sparely
*NL*
illuminated
,
which
adds
to
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
often
said
afterwards
,
that
,
although
many
funereal
*NL*
spectres
had
crossed
his
path
in
life
,
he
had
never
beheld
anything
more
*NL*
blood-curdling
and
terrible
than
that
enigmatical
form
accomplishing
*NL*
some
inexplicable
mystery
in
that
gloomy
place
,
and
beheld
thus
at
*NL*
night
.
It
was
alarming
to
suppose
that
that
thing
was
perhaps
dead
;
and
*NL*
still
more
alarming
to
think
that
it
was
perhaps
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
the
courage
to
plaster
his
face
to
the
glass
,
and
to
watch
*NL*
whether
the
thing
would
move
.
In
spite
of
his
remaining
thus
what
seemed
*NL*
to
him
a
very
long
time
,
the
outstretched
form
made
no
movement
.
All
*NL*
at
once
he
felt
himself
overpowered
by
an
inexpressible
terror
,
and
he
*NL*
fled
.
He
began
to
run
towards
the
shed
,
not
daring
to
look
behind
him
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
,
that
if
he
turned
his
head
,
he
should
see
that
form
*NL*
following
him
with
great
strides
and
waving
its
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
ruin
all
out
of
breath
.
His
knees
were
giving
way
beneath
*NL*
him
;
the
perspiration
was
pouring
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
was
he
?
Who
could
ever
have
imagined
anything
like
that
sort
of
*NL*
sepulchre
in
the
midst
of
Paris
!
What
was
this
strange
house
?
An
edifice
*NL*
full
of
nocturnal
mystery
,
calling
to
souls
through
the
darkness
with
*NL*
the
voice
of
angels
,
and
when
they
came
,
offering
them
abruptly
that
*NL*
terrible
vision
;
promising
to
open
the
radiant
portals
of
heaven
,
and
*NL*
then
opening
the
horrible
gates
of
the
tomb
!
And
it
actually
was
an
*NL*
edifice
,
a
house
,
which
bore
a
number
on
the
street
!
It
was
not
a
dream
!
*NL*
He
had
to
touch
the
stones
to
convince
himself
that
such
was
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cold
,
anxiety
,
uneasiness
,
the
emotions
of
the
night
,
had
given
him
a
*NL*
genuine
fever
,
and
all
these
ideas
were
clashing
together
in
his
brain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
up
to
Cosette
.
She
was
asleep
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
ENIGMA
BECOMES
DOUBLY
MYSTERIOUS
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
had
laid
her
head
on
a
stone
and
fallen
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
beside
her
and
began
to
think
.
Little
by
little
,
as
he
gazed
*NL*
at
her
,
he
grew
calm
and
regained
possession
of
his
freedom
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
clearly
perceived
this
truth
,
the
foundation
of
his
life
henceforth
,
*NL*
that
so
long
as
she
was
there
,
so
long
as
he
had
her
near
him
,
he
should
*NL*
need
nothing
except
for
her
,
he
should
fear
nothing
except
for
her
.
He
*NL*
was
not
even
conscious
that
he
was
very
cold
,
since
he
had
taken
off
his
*NL*
coat
to
cover
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
athwart
this
revery
into
which
he
had
fallen
he
had
heard
*NL*
for
some
time
a
peculiar
noise
.
It
was
like
the
tinkling
of
a
bell
.
This
*NL*
sound
proceeded
from
the
garden
.
It
could
be
heard
distinctly
though
*NL*
faintly
.
It
resembled
the
faint
,
vague
music
produced
by
the
bells
of
*NL*
cattle
at
night
in
the
pastures
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
noise
made
Valjean
turn
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
and
saw
that
there
was
some
one
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
being
resembling
a
man
was
walking
amid
the
bell-glasses
of
the
melon
*NL*
beds
,
rising
,
stooping
,
halting
,
with
regular
movements
,
as
though
he
*NL*
were
dragging
or
spreading
out
something
on
the
ground
.
This
person
*NL*
appeared
to
limp
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
shuddered
with
the
continual
tremor
of
the
unhappy
.
For
*NL*
them
everything
is
hostile
and
suspicious
.
They
distrust
the
day
*NL*
because
it
enables
people
to
see
them
,
and
the
night
because
it
aids
*NL*
in
surprising
them
.
A
little
while
before
he
had
shivered
because
the
*NL*
garden
was
deserted
,
and
now
he
shivered
because
there
was
some
one
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
back
from
chimerical
terrors
to
real
terrors
.
He
said
to
himself
*NL*
that
Javert
and
the
spies
had
,
perhaps
,
not
taken
their
departure
;
that
*NL*
they
had
,
no
doubt
,
left
people
on
the
watch
in
the
street
;
that
if
this
*NL*
man
should
discover
him
in
the
garden
,
he
would
cry
out
for
help
against
*NL*
thieves
and
deliver
him
up
.
He
took
the
sleeping
Cosette
gently
in
his
*NL*
arms
and
carried
her
behind
a
heap
of
old
furniture
,
which
was
out
of
*NL*
use
,
in
the
most
remote
corner
of
the
shed
.
Cosette
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
point
he
scrutinized
the
appearance
of
the
being
in
the
*NL*
melon
patch
.
The
strange
thing
about
it
was
,
that
the
sound
of
the
bell
*NL*
followed
each
of
this
man
's
movements
.
When
the
man
approached
,
the
*NL*
sound
approached
;
when
the
man
retreated
,
the
sound
retreated
;
if
he
*NL*
made
any
hasty
gesture
,
a
tremolo
accompanied
the
gesture
;
when
he
*NL*
halted
,
the
sound
ceased
.
It
appeared
evident
that
the
bell
was
attached
*NL*
to
that
man
;
but
what
could
that
signify
?
Who
was
this
man
who
had
a
*NL*
bell
suspended
about
him
like
a
ram
or
an
ox
?
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
put
these
questions
to
himself
,
he
touched
Cosette
's
hands
.
They
*NL*
were
icy
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
good
God
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
to
her
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
open
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
her
vigorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
wake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
dead
?
''
he
said
to
himself
,
and
sprang
to
his
feet
,
quivering
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
frightful
thoughts
rushed
pell-mell
through
his
mind
.
There
*NL*
are
moments
when
hideous
surmises
assail
us
like
a
cohort
of
furies
,
and
*NL*
violently
force
the
partitions
of
our
brains
.
When
those
we
love
are
in
*NL*
question
,
our
prudence
invents
every
sort
of
madness
.
He
remembered
that
*NL*
sleep
in
the
open
air
on
a
cold
night
may
be
fatal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
pale
,
and
had
fallen
at
full
length
on
the
ground
at
his
*NL*
feet
,
without
a
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
to
her
breathing
:
she
still
breathed
,
but
with
a
respiration
*NL*
which
seemed
to
him
weak
and
on
the
point
of
extinction
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
he
to
warm
her
back
to
life
?
How
was
he
to
rouse
her
?
All
that
*NL*
was
not
connected
with
this
vanished
from
his
thoughts
.
He
rushed
wildly
*NL*
from
the
ruin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
absolutely
necessary
that
Cosette
should
be
in
bed
and
beside
a
*NL*
fire
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IX
--
THE
MAN
WITH
THE
BELL
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
straight
up
to
the
man
whom
he
saw
in
the
garden
.
He
had
taken
*NL*
in
his
hand
the
roll
of
silver
which
was
in
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
's
head
was
bent
down
,
and
he
did
not
see
him
approaching
.
In
a
*NL*
few
strides
Jean
Valjean
stood
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
accosted
him
with
the
cry
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
hundred
francs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
gave
a
start
and
raised
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
earn
a
hundred
francs
,
''
went
on
Jean
Valjean
,
``
if
you
will
*NL*
grant
me
shelter
for
this
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
shone
full
upon
Jean
Valjean
's
terrified
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
so
it
is
you
,
Father
Madeleine
!
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
name
,
thus
pronounced
,
at
that
obscure
hour
,
in
that
unknown
spot
,
*NL*
by
that
strange
man
,
made
Jean
Valjean
start
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
expected
anything
but
that
.
The
person
who
thus
addressed
him
was
*NL*
a
bent
and
lame
old
man
,
dressed
almost
like
a
peasant
,
who
wore
on
his
*NL*
left
knee
a
leather
knee-cap
,
whence
hung
a
moderately
large
bell
.
His
*NL*
face
,
which
was
in
the
shadow
,
was
not
distinguishable
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
goodman
had
removed
his
cap
,
and
exclaimed
,
trembling
all
*NL*
over
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
God
!
How
come
you
here
,
Father
Madeleine
?
Where
did
you
enter
?
*NL*
Dieu-Jesus
!
Did
you
fall
from
heaven
?
There
is
no
trouble
about
that
:
*NL*
if
ever
you
do
fall
,
it
will
be
from
there
.
And
what
a
state
you
are
in
!
*NL*
You
have
no
cravat
;
you
have
no
hat
;
you
have
no
coat
!
Do
you
know
,
you
*NL*
would
have
frightened
any
one
who
did
not
know
you
?
No
coat
!
Lord
God
!
*NL*
Are
the
saints
going
mad
nowadays
?
But
how
did
you
get
in
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
tumbled
over
each
other
.
The
goodman
talked
with
a
rustic
*NL*
volubility
,
in
which
there
was
nothing
alarming
.
All
this
was
uttered
*NL*
with
a
mixture
of
stupefaction
and
naive
kindliness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
and
what
house
is
this
?
''
demanded
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
pardieu
,
this
is
too
much
!
''
exclaimed
the
old
man
.
``
I
am
the
person
*NL*
for
whom
you
got
the
place
here
,
and
this
house
is
the
one
where
you
had
*NL*
me
placed
.
What
!
You
do
n't
recognize
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
;
``
and
how
happens
it
that
you
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saved
my
life
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
.
A
ray
of
moonlight
outlined
his
profile
,
and
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
recognized
old
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
so
it
is
you
?
Yes
,
I
recollect
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
very
lucky
,
''
said
the
old
man
,
in
a
reproachful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
doing
here
?
''
resumed
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
am
covering
my
melons
,
of
course
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
at
the
moment
when
Jean
Valjean
accosted
him
,
old
Fauchelevent
*NL*
held
in
his
hand
the
end
of
a
straw
mat
which
he
was
occupied
in
*NL*
spreading
over
the
melon
bed
.
During
the
hour
or
thereabouts
that
he
had
*NL*
been
in
the
garden
he
had
already
spread
out
a
number
of
them
.
It
was
*NL*
this
operation
which
had
caused
him
to
execute
the
peculiar
movements
*NL*
observed
from
the
shed
by
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
to
myself
,
`
The
moon
is
bright
:
it
is
going
to
freeze
.
What
if
I
*NL*
were
to
put
my
melons
into
their
greatcoats
?
'
And
,
''
he
added
,
looking
at
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
with
a
broad
smile
,
--
``
pardieu
!
you
ought
to
have
done
the
*NL*
same
!
But
how
do
you
come
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
finding
himself
known
to
this
man
,
at
least
only
under
the
*NL*
name
of
Madeleine
,
thenceforth
advanced
only
with
caution
.
He
multiplied
*NL*
his
questions
.
Strange
to
say
,
their
roles
seemed
to
be
reversed
.
It
was
*NL*
he
,
the
intruder
,
who
interrogated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
this
bell
which
you
wear
on
your
knee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
,
''
replied
Fauchelevent
,
``
is
so
that
I
may
be
avoided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
so
that
you
may
be
avoided
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Fauchelevent
winked
with
an
indescribable
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
goodness
!
there
are
only
women
in
this
house
--
many
young
girls
.
It
*NL*
appears
that
I
should
be
a
dangerous
person
to
meet
.
The
bell
gives
them
*NL*
warning
.
When
I
come
,
they
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
house
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
you
know
well
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
you
got
me
the
place
here
as
gardener
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Answer
me
as
though
I
knew
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
this
is
the
Petit-Picpus
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Memories
recurred
to
Jean
Valjean
.
Chance
,
that
is
to
say
,
Providence
,
*NL*
had
cast
him
into
precisely
that
convent
in
the
Quartier
Saint-Antoine
*NL*
where
old
Fauchelevent
,
crippled
by
the
fall
from
his
cart
,
had
been
*NL*
admitted
on
his
recommendation
two
years
previously
.
He
repeated
,
as
*NL*
though
talking
to
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Petit-Picpus
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
,
''
returned
old
Fauchelevent
.
``
But
to
come
to
the
point
,
how
the
*NL*
deuce
did
you
manage
to
get
in
here
,
you
,
Father
Madeleine
?
No
matter
if
*NL*
you
are
a
saint
;
you
are
a
man
as
well
,
and
no
man
enters
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
certainly
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
but
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
must
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
God
!
''
cried
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
drew
near
to
the
old
man
,
and
said
to
him
in
a
grave
*NL*
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauchelevent
,
I
saved
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
the
first
to
recall
it
,
''
returned
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
can
do
to-day
for
me
that
which
I
did
for
you
in
the
olden
*NL*
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
took
in
his
aged
,
trembling
,
and
wrinkled
hands
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
two
robust
hands
,
and
stood
for
several
minutes
as
though
*NL*
incapable
of
speaking
.
At
length
he
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
would
be
a
blessing
from
the
good
God
,
if
I
could
make
you
*NL*
some
little
return
for
that
!
Save
your
life
!
Monsieur
le
Maire
,
dispose
*NL*
of
the
old
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
wonderful
joy
had
transfigured
this
old
man
.
His
countenance
seemed
to
*NL*
emit
a
ray
of
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
me
to
do
?
''
he
resumed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
will
explain
to
you
.
You
have
a
chamber
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
an
isolated
hovel
yonder
,
behind
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
,
*NL*
in
a
corner
which
no
one
ever
looks
into
.
There
are
three
rooms
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hut
was
,
in
fact
,
so
well
hidden
behind
the
ruins
,
and
so
cleverly
*NL*
arranged
to
prevent
it
being
seen
,
that
Jean
Valjean
had
not
perceived
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
``
Now
I
am
going
to
ask
two
things
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
,
Mr.
Mayor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place

you
are
not
to
tell
any
one
what
you
know
about
me

*NL*
In
the
second
,
you
are
not
to
try
to
find
out
anything
more
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
please

I
know
that
you
can
do
nothing
that
is
not
honest
,
*NL*
that
you
have
always
been
a
man
after
the
good
God
's
heart
.
And
then
,
*NL*
moreover
,
you
it
was
who
placed
me
here
.
That
concerns
you
.
I
am
at
your
*NL*
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
settled
then
.
Now
,
come
with
me
.
We
will
go
and
get
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Fauchelevent
,
``
so
there
is
a
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
not
a
word
further
,
and
followed
Jean
Valjean
as
a
dog
follows
*NL*
his
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
Less
than
half
an
hour
afterwards
Cosette
,
who
had
grown
rosy
again
*NL*
before
the
flame
of
a
good
fire
,
was
lying
asleep
in
the
old
gardener
's
*NL*
bed
.
Jean
Valjean
had
put
on
his
cravat
and
coat
once
more
;
his
hat
,
*NL*
which
he
had
flung
over
the
wall
,
had
been
found
and
picked
up
.
While
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
putting
on
his
coat
,
Fauchelevent
had
removed
the
*NL*
bell
and
kneecap
,
which
now
hung
on
a
nail
beside
a
vintage
basket
that
*NL*
adorned
the
wall
.
The
two
men
were
warming
themselves
with
their
elbows
*NL*
resting
on
a
table
upon
which
Fauchelevent
had
placed
a
bit
of
cheese
,
*NL*
black
bread
,
a
bottle
of
wine
,
and
two
glasses
,
and
the
old
man
was
*NL*
saying
to
Jean
Valjean
,
as
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
latter
's
knee
:
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Father
Madeleine
!
You
did
not
recognize
me
immediately
;
you
save
*NL*
people
's
lives
,
and
then
you
forget
them
!
That
is
bad
!
But
they
remember
*NL*
you
!
You
are
an
ingrate
!

CHAPTER
X
--
WHICH
EXPLAINS
HOW
JAVERT
GOT
ON
THE
SCENT
*NL*
*NL*
The
events
of
which
we
have
just
beheld
the
reverse
side
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
had
come
about
in
the
simplest
possible
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jean
Valjean
,
on
the
evening
of
the
very
day
when
Javert
had
*NL*
arrested
him
beside
Fantine
's
death-bed
,
had
escaped
from
the
town
jail
*NL*
of
M.
sur
M.
,
the
police
had
supposed
that
he
had
betaken
himself
to
*NL*
Paris
.
Paris
is
a
maelstrom
where
everything
is
lost
,
and
everything
*NL*
disappears
in
this
belly
of
the
world
,
as
in
the
belly
of
the
sea
.
No
*NL*
forest
hides
a
man
as
does
that
crowd
.
Fugitives
of
every
sort
know
*NL*
this
.
They
go
to
Paris
as
to
an
abyss
;
there
are
gulfs
which
save
.
The
*NL*
police
know
it
also
,
and
it
is
in
Paris
that
they
seek
what
they
*NL*
have
lost
elsewhere
.
They
sought
the
ex-mayor
of
M.
sur
M.
Javert
was
*NL*
summoned
to
Paris
to
throw
light
on
their
researches
.
Javert
had
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
rendered
powerful
assistance
in
the
recapture
of
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
Javert
's
zeal
and
intelligence
on
that
occasion
had
been
remarked
by
*NL*
M.
Chabouillet
,
secretary
of
the
Prefecture
under
Comte
Angles
.
M.
*NL*
Chabouillet
,
who
had
,
moreover
,
already
been
Javert
's
patron
,
had
the
*NL*
inspector
of
M.
sur
M.
attached
to
the
police
force
of
Paris
.
There
*NL*
Javert
rendered
himself
useful
in
divers
and
,
though
the
word
may
seem
*NL*
strange
for
such
services
,
honorable
manners
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
no
longer
thought
of
Jean
Valjean
,
--
the
wolf
of
to-day
causes
these
*NL*
dogs
who
are
always
on
the
chase
to
forget
the
wolf
of
yesterday
,
--
when
,
*NL*
in
December
,
1823
,
he
read
a
newspaper
,
he
who
never
read
newspapers
;
*NL*
but
Javert
,
a
monarchical
man
,
had
a
desire
to
know
the
particulars
of
*NL*
the
triumphal
entry
of
the
``
Prince
Generalissimo
''
into
Bayonne
.
Just
as
*NL*
he
was
finishing
the
article
,
which
interested
him
;
a
name
,
the
name
of
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
attracted
his
attention
at
the
bottom
of
a
page
.
The
paper
*NL*
announced
that
the
convict
Jean
Valjean
was
dead
,
and
published
the
fact
*NL*
in
such
formal
terms
that
Javert
did
not
doubt
it
.
He
confined
himself
*NL*
to
the
remark
,
``
That
's
a
good
entry
.
''
Then
he
threw
aside
the
paper
,
and
*NL*
thought
no
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
afterwards
,
it
chanced
that
a
police
report
was
transmitted
*NL*
from
the
prefecture
of
the
Seine-et-Oise
to
the
prefecture
of
police
in
*NL*
Paris
,
concerning
the
abduction
of
a
child
,
which
had
taken
place
,
under
*NL*
peculiar
circumstances
,
as
it
was
said
,
in
the
commune
of
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
A
little
girl
of
seven
or
eight
years
of
age
,
the
report
said
,
who
had
*NL*
been
intrusted
by
her
mother
to
an
inn-keeper
of
that
neighborhood
,
had
*NL*
been
stolen
by
a
stranger
;
this
child
answered
to
the
name
of
Cosette
,
*NL*
and
was
the
daughter
of
a
girl
named
Fantine
,
who
had
died
in
the
*NL*
hospital
,
it
was
not
known
where
or
when
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
report
came
under
Javert
's
eye
and
set
him
to
thinking
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Fantine
was
well
known
to
him
.
He
remembered
that
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
had
made
him
,
Javert
,
burst
into
laughter
,
by
asking
him
for
a
*NL*
respite
of
three
days
,
for
the
purpose
of
going
to
fetch
that
creature
's
*NL*
child
.
He
recalled
the
fact
that
Jean
Valjean
had
been
arrested
in
Paris
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
when
he
was
stepping
into
the
coach
for
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
Some
signs
had
made
him
suspect
at
the
time
that
this
was
the
second
*NL*
occasion
of
his
entering
that
coach
,
and
that
he
had
already
,
on
the
*NL*
previous
day
,
made
an
excursion
to
the
neighborhood
of
that
village
,
for
*NL*
he
had
not
been
seen
in
the
village
itself
.
What
had
he
been
intending
*NL*
to
do
in
that
region
of
Montfermeil
?
It
could
not
even
be
surmised
.
*NL*
Javert
understood
it
now
.
Fantine
's
daughter
was
there
.
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
going
there
in
search
of
her
.
And
now
this
child
had
been
stolen
by
a
*NL*
stranger
!
Who
could
that
stranger
be
?
Could
it
be
Jean
Valjean
?
But
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
dead
.
Javert
,
without
saying
anything
to
anybody
,
took
the
*NL*
coach
from
the
Pewter
Platter
,
Cul-de-Sac
de
la
Planchette
,
and
made
a
*NL*
trip
to
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
expected
to
find
a
great
deal
of
light
on
the
subject
there
;
he
found
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
few
days
the
Thenardiers
had
chattered
in
their
rage
.
The
*NL*
disappearance
of
the
Lark
had
created
a
sensation
in
the
village
.
He
*NL*
immediately
obtained
numerous
versions
of
the
story
,
which
ended
in
the
*NL*
abduction
of
a
child
.
Hence
the
police
report
.
But
their
first
vexation
*NL*
having
passed
off
,
Thenardier
,
with
his
wonderful
instinct
,
had
*NL*
very
quickly
comprehended
that
it
is
never
advisable
to
stir
up
the
*NL*
prosecutor
of
the
Crown
,
and
that
his
complaints
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
abduction
of
Cosette
would
have
as
their
first
result
to
fix
upon
*NL*
himself
,
and
upon
many
dark
affairs
which
he
had
on
hand
,
the
glittering
*NL*
eye
of
justice
.
The
last
thing
that
owls
desire
is
to
have
a
candle
*NL*
brought
to
them
.
And
in
the
first
place
,
how
explain
the
fifteen
hundred
*NL*
francs
which
he
had
received
?
He
turned
squarely
round
,
put
a
gag
on
*NL*
his
wife
's
mouth
,
and
feigned
astonishment
when
the
stolen
child
was
*NL*
mentioned
to
him
.
He
understood
nothing
about
it
;
no
doubt
he
had
*NL*
grumbled
for
awhile
at
having
that
dear
little
creature
``
taken
from
him
''
*NL*
so
hastily
;
he
should
have
liked
to
keep
her
two
or
three
days
longer
,
*NL*
out
of
tenderness
;
but
her
``
grandfather
''
had
come
for
her
in
the
most
*NL*
natural
way
in
the
world
.
He
added
the
``
grandfather
,
''
which
produced
a
*NL*
good
effect
.
This
was
the
story
that
Javert
hit
upon
when
he
arrived
at
*NL*
Montfermeil
.
The
grandfather
caused
Jean
Valjean
to
vanish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Javert
dropped
a
few
questions
,
like
plummets
,
into
*NL*
Thenardier
's
history
.
``
Who
was
that
grandfather
?
and
what
was
his
name
?
''
*NL*
Thenardier
replied
with
simplicity
:
``
He
is
a
wealthy
farmer
.
I
saw
his
*NL*
passport
.
I
think
his
name
was
M.
Guillaume
Lambert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lambert
is
a
respectable
and
extremely
reassuring
name
.
Thereupon
Javert
*NL*
returned
to
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jean
Valjean
is
certainly
dead
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
I
am
a
ninny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
again
begun
to
forget
this
history
,
when
,
in
the
course
of
*NL*
March
,
1824
,
he
heard
of
a
singular
personage
who
dwelt
in
the
parish
of
*NL*
Saint-Medard
and
who
had
been
surnamed
``
the
mendicant
who
gives
alms
.
''
*NL*
This
person
,
the
story
ran
,
was
a
man
of
means
,
whose
name
no
one
knew
*NL*
exactly
,
and
who
lived
alone
with
a
little
girl
of
eight
years
,
who
*NL*
knew
nothing
about
herself
,
save
that
she
had
come
from
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
Montfermeil
!
that
name
was
always
coming
up
,
and
it
made
Javert
prick
*NL*
up
his
ears
.
An
old
beggar
police
spy
,
an
ex-beadle
,
to
whom
this
person
*NL*
had
given
alms
,
added
a
few
more
details
.
This
gentleman
of
property
was
*NL*
very
shy
,
--
never
coming
out
except
in
the
evening
,
speaking
to
no
one
,
*NL*
except
,
occasionally
to
the
poor
,
and
never
allowing
any
one
to
approach
*NL*
him
.
He
wore
a
horrible
old
yellow
frock-coat
,
which
was
worth
many
*NL*
millions
,
being
all
wadded
with
bank-bills
.
This
piqued
Javert
's
*NL*
curiosity
in
a
decided
manner
.
In
order
to
get
a
close
look
at
this
*NL*
fantastic
gentleman
without
alarming
him
,
he
borrowed
the
beadle
's
*NL*
outfit
for
a
day
,
and
the
place
where
the
old
spy
was
in
the
habit
of
*NL*
crouching
every
evening
,
whining
orisons
through
his
nose
,
and
playing
*NL*
the
spy
under
cover
of
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
suspected
individual
''
did
indeed
approach
Javert
thus
disguised
,
*NL*
and
bestow
alms
on
him
.
At
that
moment
Javert
raised
his
head
,
and
the
*NL*
shock
which
Jean
Valjean
received
on
recognizing
Javert
was
equal
to
the
*NL*
one
received
by
Javert
when
he
thought
he
recognized
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
darkness
might
have
misled
him
;
Jean
Valjean
's
death
was
*NL*
official
;
Javert
cherished
very
grave
doubts
;
and
when
in
doubt
,
Javert
,
*NL*
the
man
of
scruples
,
never
laid
a
finger
on
any
one
's
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
his
man
to
the
Gorbeau
house
,
and
got
``
the
old
woman
''
to
*NL*
talking
,
which
was
no
difficult
matter
.
The
old
woman
confirmed
the
fact
*NL*
regarding
the
coat
lined
with
millions
,
and
narrated
to
him
the
episode
*NL*
of
the
thousand-franc
bill
.
She
had
seen
it
!
She
had
handled
it
!
Javert
*NL*
hired
a
room
;
that
evening
he
installed
himself
in
it
.
He
came
and
*NL*
listened
at
the
mysterious
lodger
's
door
,
hoping
to
catch
the
sound
of
*NL*
his
voice
,
but
Jean
Valjean
saw
his
candle
through
the
key-hole
,
and
*NL*
foiled
the
spy
by
keeping
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
Jean
Valjean
decamped
;
but
the
noise
made
by
the
*NL*
fall
of
the
five-franc
piece
was
noticed
by
the
old
woman
,
who
,
hearing
*NL*
the
rattling
of
coin
,
suspected
that
he
might
be
intending
to
leave
,
and
*NL*
made
haste
to
warn
Javert
.
At
night
,
when
Jean
Valjean
came
out
,
Javert
*NL*
was
waiting
for
him
behind
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
with
two
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
had
demanded
assistance
at
the
Prefecture
,
but
he
had
not
*NL*
mentioned
the
name
of
the
individual
whom
he
hoped
to
seize
;
that
was
*NL*
his
secret
,
and
he
had
kept
it
for
three
reasons
:
in
the
first
place
,
*NL*
because
the
slightest
indiscretion
might
put
Jean
Valjean
on
the
alert
;
*NL*
next
,
because
,
to
lay
hands
on
an
ex-convict
who
had
made
his
escape
*NL*
and
was
reputed
dead
,
on
a
criminal
whom
justice
had
formerly
classed
*NL*
forever
as
among
malefactors
of
the
most
dangerous
sort
,
was
a
*NL*
magnificent
success
which
the
old
members
of
the
Parisian
police
would
*NL*
assuredly
not
leave
to
a
new-comer
like
Javert
,
and
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
being
deprived
of
his
convict
;
and
lastly
,
because
Javert
,
being
an
*NL*
artist
,
had
a
taste
for
the
unforeseen
.
He
hated
those
well-heralded
*NL*
successes
which
are
talked
of
long
in
advance
and
have
had
the
bloom
*NL*
brushed
off
.
He
preferred
to
elaborate
his
masterpieces
in
the
dark
and
*NL*
to
unveil
them
suddenly
at
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
had
followed
Jean
Valjean
from
tree
to
tree
,
then
from
corner
*NL*
to
corner
of
the
street
,
and
had
not
lost
sight
of
him
for
a
single
*NL*
instant
;
even
at
the
moments
when
Jean
Valjean
believed
himself
to
*NL*
be
the
most
secure
Javert
's
eye
had
been
on
him
.
Why
had
not
Javert
*NL*
arrested
Jean
Valjean
?
Because
he
was
still
in
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
remembered
that
at
that
epoch
the
police
was
not
precisely
*NL*
at
its
ease
;
the
free
press
embarrassed
it
;
several
arbitrary
arrests
*NL*
denounced
by
the
newspapers
,
had
echoed
even
as
far
as
the
Chambers
,
and
*NL*
had
rendered
the
Prefecture
timid
.
Interference
with
individual
liberty
*NL*
was
a
grave
matter
.
The
police
agents
were
afraid
of
making
a
mistake
;
*NL*
the
prefect
laid
the
blame
on
them
;
a
mistake
meant
dismissal
.
The
*NL*
reader
can
imagine
the
effect
which
this
brief
paragraph
,
reproduced
*NL*
by
twenty
newspapers
,
would
have
caused
in
Paris
:
``
Yesterday
,
an
aged
*NL*
grandfather
,
with
white
hair
,
a
respectable
and
well-to-do
gentleman
,
*NL*
who
was
walking
with
his
grandchild
,
aged
eight
,
was
arrested
and
*NL*
conducted
to
the
agency
of
the
Prefecture
as
an
escaped
convict
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
repeat
in
addition
that
Javert
had
scruples
of
his
own
;
*NL*
injunctions
of
his
conscience
were
added
to
the
injunctions
of
the
*NL*
prefect
.
He
was
really
in
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
his
back
on
him
and
walked
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sadness
,
uneasiness
,
anxiety
,
depression
,
this
fresh
misfortune
of
being
*NL*
forced
to
flee
by
night
,
to
seek
a
chance
refuge
in
Paris
for
Cosette
*NL*
and
himself
,
the
necessity
of
regulating
his
pace
to
the
pace
of
*NL*
the
child
--
all
this
,
without
his
being
aware
of
it
,
had
altered
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
walk
,
and
impressed
on
his
bearing
such
senility
,
that
the
*NL*
police
themselves
,
incarnate
in
the
person
of
Javert
,
might
,
and
did
in
*NL*
fact
,
make
a
mistake
.
The
impossibility
of
approaching
too
close
,
his
*NL*
costume
of
an
emigre
preceptor
,
the
declaration
of
Thenardier
which
made
*NL*
a
grandfather
of
him
,
and
,
finally
,
the
belief
in
his
death
in
prison
,
*NL*
added
still
further
to
the
uncertainty
which
gathered
thick
in
Javert
's
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
it
occurred
to
him
to
make
an
abrupt
demand
for
his
*NL*
papers
;
but
if
the
man
was
not
Jean
Valjean
,
and
if
this
man
was
not
a
*NL*
good
,
honest
old
fellow
living
on
his
income
,
he
was
probably
some
merry
*NL*
blade
deeply
and
cunningly
implicated
in
the
obscure
web
of
Parisian
*NL*
misdeeds
,
some
chief
of
a
dangerous
band
,
who
gave
alms
to
conceal
*NL*
his
other
talents
,
which
was
an
old
dodge
.
He
had
trusty
fellows
,
*NL*
accomplices
'
retreats
in
case
of
emergencies
,
in
which
he
would
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
take
refuge
.
All
these
turns
which
he
was
making
through
the
*NL*
streets
seemed
to
indicate
that
he
was
not
a
simple
and
honest
man
.
To
*NL*
arrest
him
too
hastily
would
be
``
to
kill
the
hen
that
laid
the
golden
*NL*
eggs
.
''
Where
was
the
inconvenience
in
waiting
?
Javert
was
very
sure
that
*NL*
he
would
not
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
proceeded
in
a
tolerably
perplexed
state
of
mind
,
putting
to
*NL*
himself
a
hundred
questions
about
this
enigmatical
personage
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
quite
late
in
the
Rue
de
Pontoise
,
that
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
brilliant
light
thrown
from
a
dram-shop
,
he
decidedly
recognized
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
in
this
world
two
beings
who
give
a
profound
start
,
--
the
*NL*
mother
who
recovers
her
child
and
the
tiger
who
recovers
his
prey
.
*NL*
Javert
gave
that
profound
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
positively
recognized
Jean
Valjean
,
the
formidable
*NL*
convict
,
he
perceived
that
there
were
only
three
of
them
,
and
he
asked
*NL*
for
reinforcements
at
the
police
station
of
the
Rue
de
Pontoise
.
One
*NL*
puts
on
gloves
before
grasping
a
thorn
cudgel
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
delay
and
the
halt
at
the
Carrefour
Rollin
to
consult
with
his
*NL*
agents
came
near
causing
him
to
lose
the
trail
.
He
speedily
divined
,
*NL*
however
,
that
Jean
Valjean
would
want
to
put
the
river
between
his
*NL*
pursuers
and
himself
.
He
bent
his
head
and
reflected
like
a
blood-hound
*NL*
who
puts
his
nose
to
the
ground
to
make
sure
that
he
is
on
the
right
*NL*
scent
.
Javert
,
with
his
powerful
rectitude
of
instinct
,
went
straight
to
*NL*
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
.
A
word
with
the
toll-keeper
furnished
him
with
*NL*
the
information
which
he
required
:
``
Have
you
seen
a
man
with
a
little
*NL*
girl
?
''
``
I
made
him
pay
two
sous
,
''
replied
the
toll-keeper
.
Javert
*NL*
reached
the
bridge
in
season
to
see
Jean
Valjean
traverse
the
small
*NL*
illuminated
spot
on
the
other
side
of
the
water
,
leading
Cosette
by
*NL*
the
hand
.
He
saw
him
enter
the
Rue
du
Chemin-Vert-Saint-Antoine
;
he
*NL*
remembered
the
Cul-de-Sac
Genrot
arranged
there
like
a
trap
,
and
of
the
*NL*
sole
exit
of
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
into
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
.
He
made
sure
*NL*
of
his
back
burrows
,
as
huntsmen
say
;
he
hastily
despatched
one
of
his
*NL*
agents
,
by
a
roundabout
way
,
to
guard
that
issue
.
A
patrol
which
was
*NL*
returning
to
the
Arsenal
post
having
passed
him
,
he
made
a
requisition
*NL*
on
it
,
and
caused
it
to
accompany
him
.
In
such
games
soldiers
are
aces
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
principle
is
,
that
in
order
to
get
the
best
of
a
wild
*NL*
boar
,
one
must
employ
the
science
of
venery
and
plenty
of
dogs
.
These
*NL*
combinations
having
been
effected
,
feeling
that
Jean
Valjean
was
caught
*NL*
between
the
blind
alley
Genrot
on
the
right
,
his
agent
on
the
left
,
and
*NL*
himself
,
Javert
,
in
the
rear
,
he
took
a
pinch
of
snuff
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
the
game
.
He
experienced
one
ecstatic
and
infernal
moment
;
*NL*
he
allowed
his
man
to
go
on
ahead
,
knowing
that
he
had
him
safe
,
but
*NL*
desirous
of
postponing
the
moment
of
arrest
as
long
as
possible
,
happy
*NL*
at
the
thought
that
he
was
taken
and
yet
at
seeing
him
free
,
gloating
*NL*
over
him
with
his
gaze
,
with
that
voluptuousness
of
the
spider
which
*NL*
allows
the
fly
to
flutter
,
and
of
the
cat
which
lets
the
mouse
run
.
*NL*
Claws
and
talons
possess
a
monstrous
sensuality
,
--
the
obscure
movements
*NL*
of
the
creature
imprisoned
in
their
pincers
.
What
a
delight
this
*NL*
strangling
is
!
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
enjoying
himself
.
The
meshes
of
his
net
were
stoutly
knotted
.
*NL*
He
was
sure
of
success
;
all
he
had
to
do
now
was
to
close
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accompanied
as
he
was
,
the
very
idea
of
resistance
was
impossible
,
*NL*
however
vigorous
,
energetic
,
and
desperate
Jean
Valjean
might
be
.

*NL*
*NL*
Javert
advanced
slowly
,
sounding
,
searching
on
his
way
all
the
nooks
of
*NL*
the
street
like
so
many
pockets
of
thieves
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
reached
the
centre
of
the
web
he
found
the
fly
no
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
exasperation
can
be
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
interrogated
his
sentinel
of
the
Rues
Droit-Mur
and
Petit-Picpus
;
*NL*
that
agent
,
who
had
remained
imperturbably
at
his
post
,
had
not
seen
the
*NL*
man
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happens
that
a
stag
is
lost
head
and
horns
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
he
escapes
although
he
has
the
pack
on
his
very
heels
,
and
then
the
*NL*
oldest
huntsmen
know
not
what
to
say
.
Duvivier

In
a
discomfiture
of
this
sort
,
Artonge
exclaims
,
``
It
was
*NL*
not
a
stag
,
but
a
sorcerer
.
''
Javert
would
have
liked
to
utter
the
same
*NL*
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
disappointment
bordered
for
a
moment
on
despair
and
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
Napoleon
made
mistakes
during
the
war
with
Russia
,
*NL*
that
Alexander
committed
blunders
in
the
war
in
India
,
that
Caesar
made
*NL*
mistakes
in
the
war
in
Africa
,
that
Cyrus
was
at
fault
in
the
war
*NL*
in
Scythia
,
and
that
Javert
blundered
in
this
campaign
against
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
He
was
wrong
,
perhaps
,
in
hesitating
in
his
recognition
of
the
*NL*
exconvict
.
The
first
glance
should
have
sufficed
him
.
He
was
wrong
in
*NL*
not
arresting
him
purely
and
simply
in
the
old
building
;
he
was
wrong
*NL*
in
not
arresting
him
when
he
positively
recognized
him
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Pontoise
.
He
was
wrong
in
taking
counsel
with
his
auxiliaries
in
the
*NL*
full
light
of
the
moon
in
the
Carrefour
Rollin
.
Advice
is
certainly
*NL*
useful
;
it
is
a
good
thing
to
know
and
to
interrogate
those
of
the
dogs
*NL*
who
deserve
confidence
;
but
the
hunter
can
not
be
too
cautious
when
he
is
*NL*
chasing
uneasy
animals
like
the
wolf
and
the
convict
.
Javert
,
by
taking
*NL*
too
much
thought
as
to
how
he
should
set
the
bloodhounds
of
the
pack
on
*NL*
the
trail
,
alarmed
the
beast
by
giving
him
wind
of
the
dart
,
and
so
*NL*
made
him
run
.
Above
all
,
he
was
wrong
in
that
after
he
had
picked
up
the
*NL*
scent
again
on
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
,
he
played
that
formidable
and
*NL*
puerile
game
of
keeping
such
a
man
at
the
end
of
a
thread
.
He
thought
*NL*
himself
stronger
than
he
was
,
and
believed
that
he
could
play
at
the
*NL*
game
of
the
mouse
and
the
lion
.
At
the
same
time
,
he
reckoned
himself
*NL*
as
too
weak
,
when
he
judged
it
necessary
to
obtain
reinforcement
.
Fatal
*NL*
precaution
,
waste
of
precious
time
!
Javert
committed
all
these
blunders
,
*NL*
and
none
the
less
was
one
of
the
cleverest
and
most
correct
spies
that
*NL*
ever
existed
.
He
was
,
in
the
full
force
of
the
term
,
what
is
called
in
*NL*
venery
a
knowing
dog
.
But
what
is
there
that
is
perfect
?
*NL*
*NL*
Great
strategists
have
their
eclipses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
follies
are
often
composed
,
like
the
largest
ropes
,
of
*NL*
a
multitude
of
strands
.
Take
the
cable
thread
by
thread
,
take
all
the
*NL*
petty
determining
motives
separately
,
and
you
can
break
them
one
after
*NL*
the
other
,
and
you
say
,
``
That
is
all
there
is
of
it
!
''
Braid
them
,
twist
*NL*
them
together
;
the
result
is
enormous
:
it
is
Attila
hesitating
between
*NL*
Marcian
on
the
east
and
Valentinian
on
the
west
;
it
is
Hannibal
tarrying
*NL*
at
Capua
;
it
is
Danton
falling
asleep
at
Arcis-sur-Aube
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
that
may
be
,
even
at
the
moment
when
he
saw
that
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
had
escaped
him
,
Javert
did
not
lose
his
head
.
Sure
that
the
convict
who
*NL*
had
broken
his
ban
could
not
be
far
off
,
he
established
sentinels
,
he
*NL*
organized
traps
and
ambuscades
,
and
beat
the
quarter
all
that
night
.
The
*NL*
first
thing
he
saw
was
the
disorder
in
the
street
lantern
whose
rope
*NL*
had
been
cut
.
A
precious
sign
which
,
however
,
led
him
astray
,
since
it
*NL*
caused
him
to
turn
all
his
researches
in
the
direction
of
the
Cul-de-Sac
*NL*
Genrot
.
In
this
blind
alley
there
were
tolerably
low
walls
which
abutted
*NL*
on
gardens
whose
bounds
adjoined
the
immense
stretches
of
waste
land
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
evidently
must
have
fled
in
that
direction
.
The
fact
is
,
*NL*
that
had
he
penetrated
a
little
further
in
the
Cul-de-Sac
Genrot
,
he
*NL*
would
probably
have
done
so
and
have
been
lost
.
Javert
explored
these
*NL*
gardens
and
these
waste
stretches
as
though
he
had
been
hunting
for
a
*NL*
needle
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
he
left
two
intelligent
men
on
the
outlook
,
and
returned
to
*NL*
the
Prefecture
of
Police
,
as
much
ashamed
as
a
police
spy
who
had
been
*NL*
captured
by
a
robber
might
have
been
.

CHAPTER
I
--
NUMBER
62
RUE
PETIT-PICPUS
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
,
half
a
century
ago
,
more
resembled
every
other
carriage
gate
*NL*
than
the
carriage
gate
of
Number
62
Rue
Petit-Picpus
.
This
entrance
,
*NL*
which
usually
stood
ajar
in
the
most
inviting
fashion
,
permitted
a
*NL*
view
of
two
things
,
neither
of
which
have
anything
very
funereal
about
*NL*
them
,
--
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
walls
hung
with
vines
,
and
the
face
*NL*
of
a
lounging
porter
.
Above
the
wall
,
at
the
bottom
of
the
court
,
tall
*NL*
trees
were
visible
.
When
a
ray
of
sunlight
enlivened
the
courtyard
,
when
*NL*
a
glass
of
wine
cheered
up
the
porter
,
it
was
difficult
to
pass
Number
*NL*
62
Little
Picpus
Street
without
carrying
away
a
smiling
impression
of
*NL*
it
.
Nevertheless
,
it
was
a
sombre
place
of
which
one
had
had
a
glimpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
threshold
smiled
;
the
house
prayed
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
succeeded
in
passing
the
porter
,
which
was
not
easy
,
--
which
was
*NL*
even
nearly
impossible
for
every
one
,
for
there
was
an
open
sesame
!
*NL*
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
,
--
if
,
the
porter
once
passed
,
one
entered
*NL*
a
little
vestibule
on
the
right
,
on
which
opened
a
staircase
shut
in
*NL*
between
two
walls
and
so
narrow
that
only
one
person
could
ascend
it
at
*NL*
a
time
,
if
one
did
not
allow
one
's
self
to
be
alarmed
by
a
daubing
of
*NL*
canary
yellow
,
with
a
dado
of
chocolate
which
clothed
this
staircase
,
if
*NL*
one
ventured
to
ascend
it
,
one
crossed
a
first
landing
,
then
a
second
,
*NL*
and
arrived
on
the
first
story
at
a
corridor
where
the
yellow
wash
and
*NL*
the
chocolate-hued
plinth
pursued
one
with
a
peaceable
persistency
.
*NL*
Staircase
and
corridor
were
lighted
by
two
beautiful
windows
.
The
*NL*
corridor
took
a
turn
and
became
dark
.
If
one
doubled
this
cape
,
one
*NL*
arrived
a
few
paces
further
on
,
in
front
of
a
door
which
was
all
the
*NL*
more
mysterious
because
it
was
not
fastened
.
If
one
opened
it
,
one
*NL*
found
one
's
self
in
a
little
chamber
about
six
feet
square
,
tiled
,
*NL*
well-scrubbed
,
clean
,
cold
,
and
hung
with
nankin
paper
with
green
*NL*
flowers
,
at
fifteen
sous
the
roll
.
A
white
,
dull
light
fell
from
a
large
*NL*
window
,
with
tiny
panes
,
on
the
left
,
which
usurped
the
whole
width
*NL*
of
the
room
.
One
gazed
about
,
but
saw
no
one
;
one
listened
,
one
heard
*NL*
neither
a
footstep
nor
a
human
murmur
.
The
walls
were
bare
,
the
chamber
*NL*
was
not
furnished
;
there
was
not
even
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
looked
again
,
and
beheld
on
the
wall
facing
the
door
a
quadrangular
*NL*
hole
,
about
a
foot
square
,
with
a
grating
of
interlacing
iron
bars
,
*NL*
black
,
knotted
,
solid
,
which
formed
squares
--
I
had
almost
said
*NL*
meshes
--
of
less
than
an
inch
and
a
half
in
diagonal
length
.
The
little
*NL*
green
flowers
of
the
nankin
paper
ran
in
a
calm
and
orderly
manner
to
*NL*
those
iron
bars
,
without
being
startled
or
thrown
into
confusion
by
*NL*
their
funereal
contact
.
Supposing
that
a
living
being
had
been
so
*NL*
wonderfully
thin
as
to
essay
an
entrance
or
an
exit
through
the
square
*NL*
hole
,
this
grating
would
have
prevented
it
.
It
did
not
allow
the
passage
*NL*
of
the
body
,
but
it
did
allow
the
passage
of
the
eyes
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
of
the
mind
.
This
seems
to
have
occurred
to
them
,
for
it
had
been
*NL*
re-enforced
by
a
sheet
of
tin
inserted
in
the
wall
a
little
in
the
rear
,
*NL*
and
pierced
with
a
thousand
holes
more
microscopic
than
the
holes
of
*NL*
a
strainer
.
At
the
bottom
of
this
plate
,
an
aperture
had
been
pierced
*NL*
exactly
similar
to
the
orifice
of
a
letter
box
.
A
bit
of
tape
attached
*NL*
to
a
bell-wire
hung
at
the
right
of
the
grated
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
tape
was
pulled
,
a
bell
rang
,
and
one
heard
a
voice
very
near
at
*NL*
hand
,
which
made
one
start
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
?
''
the
voice
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
woman
's
voice
,
a
gentle
voice
,
so
gentle
that
it
was
mournful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
again
,
there
was
a
magical
word
which
it
was
necessary
to
know
.
If
*NL*
one
did
not
know
it
,
the
voice
ceased
,
the
wall
became
silent
once
more
,
*NL*
as
though
the
terrified
obscurity
of
the
sepulchre
had
been
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
knew
the
password
,
the
voice
resumed
,
``
Enter
on
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
then
perceived
on
the
right
,
facing
the
window
,
a
glass
door
*NL*
surmounted
by
a
frame
glazed
and
painted
gray
.
On
raising
the
latch
and
*NL*
crossing
the
threshold
,
one
experienced
precisely
the
same
impression
*NL*
as
when
one
enters
at
the
theatre
into
a
grated
baignoire
,
before
the
*NL*
grating
is
lowered
and
the
chandelier
is
lighted
.
One
was
,
in
fact
,
in
*NL*
a
sort
of
theatre-box
,
narrow
,
furnished
with
two
old
chairs
,
and
a
*NL*
much-frayed
straw
matting
,
sparely
illuminated
by
the
vague
light
from
*NL*
the
glass
door
;
a
regular
box
,
with
its
front
just
of
a
height
to
lean
*NL*
upon
,
bearing
a
tablet
of
black
wood
.
This
box
was
grated
,
only
*NL*
the
grating
of
it
was
not
of
gilded
wood
,
as
at
the
opera
;
it
was
a
*NL*
monstrous
lattice
of
iron
bars
,
hideously
interlaced
and
riveted
to
the
*NL*
wall
by
enormous
fastenings
which
resembled
clenched
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
minutes
passed
;
when
one
's
eyes
began
to
grow
used
to
this
*NL*
cellar-like
half-twilight
,
one
tried
to
pass
the
grating
,
but
got
no
*NL*
further
than
six
inches
beyond
it
.
There
he
encountered
a
barrier
of
*NL*
black
shutters
,
re-enforced
and
fortified
with
transverse
beams
of
wood
*NL*
painted
a
gingerbread
yellow
.
These
shutters
were
divided
into
long
,
*NL*
narrow
slats
,
and
they
masked
the
entire
length
of
the
grating
.
They
*NL*
were
always
closed
.
At
the
expiration
of
a
few
moments
one
heard
a
voice
*NL*
proceeding
from
behind
these
shutters
,
and
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
.
What
do
you
wish
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
beloved
,
sometimes
an
adored
,
voice
.
No
one
was
visible
.
Hardly
*NL*
the
sound
of
a
breath
was
audible
.
It
seemed
as
though
it
were
a
spirit
*NL*
which
had
been
evoked
,
that
was
speaking
to
you
across
the
walls
of
the
*NL*
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
chanced
to
be
within
certain
prescribed
and
very
rare
conditions
,
*NL*
the
slat
of
one
of
the
shutters
opened
opposite
you
;
the
evoked
spirit
*NL*
became
an
apparition
.
Behind
the
grating
,
behind
the
shutter
,
one
*NL*
perceived
so
far
as
the
grating
permitted
sight
,
a
head
,
of
which
only
*NL*
the
mouth
and
the
chin
were
visible
;
the
rest
was
covered
with
a
black
*NL*
veil
.
One
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
black
guimpe
,
and
a
form
that
was
barely
*NL*
defined
,
covered
with
a
black
shroud
.
That
head
spoke
with
you
,
but
did
*NL*
not
look
at
you
and
never
smiled
at
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
which
came
from
behind
you
was
adjusted
in
such
a
manner
that
*NL*
you
saw
her
in
the
white
,
and
she
saw
you
in
the
black
.
This
light
was
*NL*
symbolical
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
your
eyes
plunged
eagerly
through
that
opening
which
*NL*
was
made
in
that
place
shut
off
from
all
glances
.
A
profound
vagueness
*NL*
enveloped
that
form
clad
in
mourning
.
Your
eyes
searched
that
vagueness
,
*NL*
and
sought
to
make
out
the
surroundings
of
the
apparition
.
At
the
*NL*
expiration
of
a
very
short
time
you
discovered
that
you
could
see
*NL*
nothing
.
What
you
beheld
was
night
,
emptiness
,
shadows
,
a
wintry
mist
*NL*
mingled
with
a
vapor
from
the
tomb
,
a
sort
of
terrible
peace
,
a
silence
*NL*
from
which
you
could
gather
nothing
,
not
even
sighs
,
a
gloom
in
which
*NL*
you
could
distinguish
nothing
,
not
even
phantoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
you
beheld
was
the
interior
of
a
cloister
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
interior
of
that
severe
and
gloomy
edifice
which
was
called
*NL*
the
Convent
of
the
Bernardines
of
the
Perpetual
Adoration
.
The
box
in
*NL*
which
you
stood
was
the
parlor
.
The
first
voice
which
had
addressed
you
*NL*
was
that
of
the
portress
who
always
sat
motionless
and
silent
,
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
wall
,
near
the
square
opening
,
screened
by
the
iron
*NL*
grating
and
the
plate
with
its
thousand
holes
,
as
by
a
double
visor
.
*NL*
The
obscurity
which
bathed
the
grated
box
arose
from
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
parlor
,
which
had
a
window
on
the
side
of
the
world
,
had
none
on
the
*NL*
side
of
the
convent
.
Profane
eyes
must
see
nothing
of
that
sacred
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
something
beyond
that
shadow
;
there
was
a
light
;
*NL*
there
was
life
in
the
midst
of
that
death
.
Although
this
was
the
most
*NL*
strictly
walled
of
all
convents
,
we
shall
endeavor
to
make
our
way
into
*NL*
it
,
and
to
take
the
reader
in
,
and
to
say
,
without
transgressing
the
*NL*
proper
bounds
,
things
which
story-tellers
have
never
seen
,
and
have
,
*NL*
therefore
,
never
described
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
OBEDIENCE
OF
MARTIN
VERGA
*NL*
*NL*
This
convent
,
which
in
1824
had
already
existed
for
many
a
long
year
in
*NL*
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
,
was
a
community
of
Bernardines
of
the
obedience
of
*NL*
Martin
Verga
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
Bernardines
were
attached
,
in
consequence
,
not
to
Clairvaux
,
like
*NL*
the
Bernardine
monks
,
but
to
Citeaux
,
like
the
Benedictine
monks
.
In
*NL*
other
words
,
they
were
the
subjects
,
not
of
Saint
Bernard
,
but
of
Saint
*NL*
Benoit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
has
turned
over
old
folios
to
any
extent
knows
that
Martin
*NL*
Verga
founded
in
1425
a
congregation
of
Bernardines-Benedictines
,
*NL*
with
Salamanca
for
the
head
of
the
order
,
and
Alcala
as
the
branch
*NL*
establishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
congregation
had
sent
out
branches
throughout
all
the
Catholic
*NL*
countries
of
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
unusual
in
the
Latin
Church
in
these
grafts
of
one
*NL*
order
on
another
.
To
mention
only
a
single
order
of
Saint-Benoit
,
which
*NL*
is
here
in
question
:
there
are
attached
to
this
order
,
without
counting
*NL*
the
obedience
of
Martin
Verga
,
four
congregations
,
--
two
in
Italy
,
*NL*
Mont-Cassin
and
Sainte-Justine
of
Padua
;
two
in
France
,
Cluny
and
*NL*
Saint-Maur
;
and
nine
orders
,
--
Vallombrosa
,
Granmont
,
the
Celestins
,
*NL*
the
Camaldules
,
the
Carthusians
,
the
Humilies
,
the
Olivateurs
,
the
*NL*
Silvestrins
,
and
lastly
,
Citeaux
;
for
Citeaux
itself
,
a
trunk
for
other
*NL*
orders
,
is
only
an
offshoot
of
Saint-Benoit
.
Citeaux
dates
from
Saint
*NL*
Robert
,
Abbe
de
Molesme
,
in
the
diocese
of
Langres
,
in
1098
.
Now
it
was
*NL*
in
529
that
the
devil
,
having
retired
to
the
desert
of
Subiaco
--
he
*NL*
was
old
--
had
he
turned
hermit
?
--
was
chased
from
the
ancient
temple
of
*NL*
Apollo
,
where
he
dwelt
,
by
Saint-Benoit
,
then
aged
seventeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
rule
of
the
Carmelites
,
who
go
barefoot
,
wear
a
bit
of
willow
*NL*
on
their
throats
,
and
never
sit
down
,
the
harshest
rule
is
that
of
the
*NL*
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
Martin
Verga
.
They
are
clothed
in
black
,
*NL*
with
a
guimpe
,
which
,
in
accordance
with
the
express
command
of
*NL*
Saint-Benoit
,
mounts
to
the
chin
.
A
robe
of
serge
with
large
sleeves
,
*NL*
a
large
woollen
veil
,
the
guimpe
which
mounts
to
the
chin
cut
square
on
*NL*
the
breast
,
the
band
which
descends
over
their
brow
to
their
eyes
,
--
this
*NL*
is
their
dress
.
All
is
black
except
the
band
,
which
is
white
.
The
*NL*
novices
wear
the
same
habit
,
but
all
in
white
.
The
professed
nuns
also
*NL*
wear
a
rosary
at
their
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
Martin
Verga
practise
the
Perpetual
*NL*
Adoration
,
like
the
Benedictines
called
Ladies
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
,
*NL*
who
,
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
,
had
two
houses
in
Paris
,
--
one
at
*NL*
the
Temple
,
the
other
in
the
Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve
.
However
,
the
*NL*
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
the
Petit-Picpus
,
of
whom
we
are
speaking
,
*NL*
were
a
totally
different
order
from
the
Ladies
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
,
*NL*
cloistered
in
the
Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve
and
at
the
Temple
.
There
*NL*
were
numerous
differences
in
their
rule
;
there
were
some
in
their
*NL*
costume
.
The
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
the
Petit-Picpus
wore
the
*NL*
black
guimpe
,
and
the
Benedictines
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
and
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Neuve-Sainte-Genevieve
wore
a
white
one
,
and
had
,
besides
,
on
their
*NL*
breasts
,
a
Holy
Sacrament
about
three
inches
long
,
in
silver
gilt
or
*NL*
gilded
copper
.
The
nuns
of
the
Petit-Picpus
did
not
wear
this
Holy
*NL*
Sacrament
.
The
Perpetual
Adoration
,
which
was
common
to
the
house
of
*NL*
the
Petit-Picpus
and
to
the
house
of
the
Temple
,
leaves
those
two
orders
*NL*
perfectly
distinct
.
Their
only
resemblance
lies
in
this
practice
of
the
*NL*
Ladies
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
and
the
Bernardines
of
Martin
Verga
,
just
*NL*
as
there
existed
a
similarity
in
the
study
and
the
glorification
of
*NL*
all
the
mysteries
relating
to
the
infancy
,
the
life
,
and
death
of
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
and
the
Virgin
,
between
the
two
orders
,
which
were
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
widely
separated
,
and
on
occasion
even
hostile
.
The
Oratory
of
Italy
,
*NL*
established
at
Florence
by
Philip
de
Neri
,
and
the
Oratory
of
France
,
*NL*
established
by
Pierre
de
Berulle
.
The
Oratory
of
France
claimed
the
*NL*
precedence
,
since
Philip
de
Neri
was
only
a
saint
,
while
Berulle
was
a
*NL*
cardinal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
the
harsh
Spanish
rule
of
Martin
Verga
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
this
obedience
fast
all
the
year
*NL*
round
,
abstain
from
meat
,
fast
in
Lent
and
on
many
other
days
which
are
*NL*
peculiar
to
them
,
rise
from
their
first
sleep
,
from
one
to
three
o'clock
*NL*
in
the
morning
,
to
read
their
breviary
and
chant
matins
,
sleep
in
all
*NL*
seasons
between
serge
sheets
and
on
straw
,
make
no
use
of
the
bath
,
*NL*
never
light
a
fire
,
scourge
themselves
every
Friday
,
observe
the
rule
of
*NL*
silence
,
speak
to
each
other
only
during
the
recreation
hours
,
which
are
*NL*
very
brief
,
and
wear
drugget
chemises
for
six
months
in
the
year
,
from
*NL*
September
14th
,
which
is
the
Exaltation
of
the
Holy
Cross
,
until
Easter
.
*NL*
These
six
months
are
a
modification
:
the
rule
says
all
the
year
,
but
*NL*
this
drugget
chemise
,
intolerable
in
the
heat
of
summer
,
produced
fevers
*NL*
and
nervous
spasms
.
The
use
of
it
had
to
be
restricted
.
Even
with
this
*NL*
palliation
,
when
the
nuns
put
on
this
chemise
on
the
14th
of
September
,
*NL*
they
suffer
from
fever
for
three
or
four
days
.
Obedience
,
poverty
,
*NL*
chastity
,
perseverance
in
their
seclusion
,
--
these
are
their
vows
,
which
*NL*
the
rule
greatly
aggravates
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
is
elected
for
three
years
by
the
mothers
,
who
are
called
*NL*
meres
vocales
because
they
have
a
voice
in
the
chapter
.
A
prioress
can
*NL*
only
be
re-elected
twice
,
which
fixes
the
longest
possible
reign
of
a
*NL*
prioress
at
nine
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
never
see
the
officiating
priest
,
who
is
always
hidden
from
them
*NL*
by
a
serge
curtain
nine
feet
in
height
.
During
the
sermon
,
when
the
*NL*
preacher
is
in
the
chapel
,
they
drop
their
veils
over
their
faces
.
They
*NL*
must
always
speak
low
,
walk
with
their
eyes
on
the
ground
and
their
*NL*
heads
bowed
.
One
man
only
is
allowed
to
enter
the
convent
,
--
the
*NL*
archbishop
of
the
diocese
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
really
one
other
,
--
the
gardener
.
But
he
is
always
an
old
man
,
*NL*
and
,
in
order
that
he
may
always
be
alone
in
the
garden
,
and
that
the
*NL*
nuns
may
be
warned
to
avoid
him
,
a
bell
is
attached
to
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
submission
to
the
prioress
is
absolute
and
passive
.
It
is
the
*NL*
canonical
subjection
in
the
full
force
of
its
abnegation
.
As
at
the
*NL*
voice
of
Christ
,
ut
voci
Christi
,
at
a
gesture
,
at
the
first
sign
,
*NL*
ad
nutum
,
ad
primum
signum
,
immediately
,
with
cheerfulness
,
with
*NL*
perseverance
,
with
a
certain
blind
obedience
,
prompte
,
hilariter
,
*NL*
perseveranter
et
caeca
quadam
obedientia
,
as
the
file
in
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
workman
,
quasi
limam
in
manibus
fabri
,
without
power
to
read
or
to
write
*NL*
without
express
permission
,
legere
vel
scribere
non
addiscerit
sine
*NL*
expressa
superioris
licentia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
one
of
them
in
turn
makes
what
they
call
reparation
.
The
reparation
*NL*
is
the
prayer
for
all
the
sins
,
for
all
the
faults
,
for
all
the
*NL*
dissensions
,
for
all
the
violations
,
for
all
the
iniquities
,
for
all
the
*NL*
crimes
committed
on
earth
.
For
the
space
of
twelve
consecutive
hours
,
*NL*
from
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
till
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
or
*NL*
from
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
until
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
the
sister
who
is
making
reparation
remains
on
her
knees
on
the
stone
*NL*
before
the
Holy
Sacrament
,
with
hands
clasped
,
a
rope
around
her
neck
.
*NL*
When
her
fatigue
becomes
unendurable
,
she
prostrates
herself
flat
on
*NL*
her
face
against
the
earth
,
with
her
arms
outstretched
in
the
form
of
a
*NL*
cross
;
this
is
her
only
relief
.
In
this
attitude
she
prays
for
all
the
*NL*
guilty
in
the
universe
.
This
is
great
to
sublimity
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
act
is
performed
in
front
of
a
post
on
which
burns
a
candle
,
it
*NL*
is
called
without
distinction
,
to
make
reparation
or
to
be
at
the
post
.
*NL*
The
nuns
even
prefer
,
out
of
humility
,
this
last
expression
,
which
*NL*
contains
an
idea
of
torture
and
abasement
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
make
reparation
is
a
function
in
which
the
whole
soul
is
absorbed
.
*NL*
The
sister
at
the
post
would
not
turn
round
were
a
thunderbolt
to
fall
*NL*
directly
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
there
is
always
a
sister
kneeling
before
the
Holy
*NL*
Sacrament
.
This
station
lasts
an
hour
.
They
relieve
each
other
like
*NL*
soldiers
on
guard
.
This
is
the
Perpetual
Adoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioresses
and
the
mothers
almost
always
bear
names
stamped
with
*NL*
peculiar
solemnity
,
recalling
,
not
the
saints
and
martyrs
,
but
moments
*NL*
in
the
life
of
Jesus
Christ
:
as
Mother
Nativity
,
Mother
Conception
,
*NL*
Mother
Presentation
,
Mother
Passion
.
But
the
names
of
saints
are
not
*NL*
interdicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
sees
them
,
one
never
sees
anything
but
their
mouths
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
their
teeth
are
yellow
.
No
tooth-brush
ever
entered
that
convent
.
*NL*
Brushing
one
's
teeth
is
at
the
top
of
a
ladder
at
whose
bottom
is
the
*NL*
loss
of
one
's
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
never
say
my
.
They
possess
nothing
of
their
own
,
and
they
must
not
*NL*
attach
themselves
to
anything
.
They
call
everything
our
;
thus
:
our
veil
,
*NL*
our
chaplet
;
if
they
were
speaking
of
their
chemise
,
they
would
say
our
*NL*
chemise
.
Sometimes
they
grow
attached
to
some
petty
object
,
--
to
a
book
*NL*
of
hours
,
a
relic
,
a
medal
that
has
been
blessed
.
As
soon
as
they
become
*NL*
aware
that
they
are
growing
attached
to
this
object
,
they
must
give
it
*NL*
up
.
They
recall
the
words
of
Saint
Therese
,
to
whom
a
great
lady
said
,
*NL*
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
entering
her
order
,
``
Permit
me
,
mother
,
to
*NL*
send
for
a
Bible
to
which
I
am
greatly
attached
.
''
``
Ah
,
you
are
attached
*NL*
to
something
!
In
that
case
,
do
not
enter
our
order
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
person
whatever
is
forbidden
to
shut
herself
up
,
to
have
a
place
*NL*
of
her
own
,
a
chamber
.
They
live
with
their
cells
open
.
When
they
meet
,
*NL*
one
says
,
``
Blessed
and
adored
be
the
most
Holy
Sacrament
of
the
altar
!
''
*NL*
The
other
responds
,
``
Forever
.
''
The
same
ceremony
when
one
taps
at
the
*NL*
other
's
door
.
Hardly
has
she
touched
the
door
when
a
soft
voice
on
the
*NL*
other
side
is
heard
to
say
hastily
,
``
Forever
!
''
Like
all
practices
,
this
*NL*
becomes
mechanical
by
force
of
habit
;
and
one
sometimes
says
forever
*NL*
before
the
other
has
had
time
to
say
the
rather
long
sentence
,
``
Praised
*NL*
and
adored
be
the
most
Holy
Sacrament
of
the
altar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
Visitandines
the
one
who
enters
says
:
``
Ave
Maria
,
''
and
the
one
*NL*
whose
cell
is
entered
says
,
``
Gratia
plena
.
''
It
is
their
way
of
saying
*NL*
good
day
,
which
is
in
fact
full
of
grace
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
each
hour
of
the
day
three
supplementary
strokes
sound
from
the
*NL*
church
bell
of
the
convent
.
At
this
signal
prioress
,
vocal
mothers
,
*NL*
professed
nuns
,
lay-sisters
,
novices
,
postulants
,
interrupt
what
they
*NL*
are
saying
,
what
they
are
doing
,
or
what
they
are
thinking
,
and
all
say
*NL*
in
unison
if
it
is
five
o'clock
,
for
instance
,
``
At
five
o'clock
and
at
*NL*
all
hours
praised
and
adored
be
the
most
Holy
Sacrament
of
the
altar
!
''
*NL*
If
it
is
eight
o'clock
,
``
At
eight
o'clock
and
at
all
hours
!
''
and
so
on
,
*NL*
according
to
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
custom
,
the
object
of
which
is
to
break
the
thread
of
thought
*NL*
and
to
lead
it
back
constantly
to
God
,
exists
in
many
communities
;
the
*NL*
formula
alone
varies
.
Thus
at
The
Infant
Jesus
they
say
,
``
At
this
*NL*
hour
and
at
every
hour
may
the
love
of
Jesus
kindle
my
heart
!
''
The
*NL*
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
Martin
Verga
,
cloistered
fifty
years
ago
at
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
,
chant
the
offices
to
a
solemn
psalmody
,
a
pure
Gregorian
*NL*
chant
,
and
always
with
full
voice
during
the
whole
course
of
the
office
.
*NL*
Everywhere
in
the
missal
where
an
asterisk
occurs
they
pause
,
and
say
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
,
``
Jesus-Marie-Joseph
.
''
For
the
office
of
the
dead
they
adopt
*NL*
a
tone
so
low
that
the
voices
of
women
can
hardly
descend
to
such
a
*NL*
depth
.
The
effect
produced
is
striking
and
tragic
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nuns
of
the
Petit-Picpus
had
made
a
vault
under
their
grand
altar
*NL*
for
the
burial
of
their
community
.
The
Government
,
as
they
say
,
does
not
*NL*
permit
this
vault
to
receive
coffins
so
they
leave
the
convent
when
they
*NL*
die
.
This
is
an
affliction
to
them
,
and
causes
them
consternation
as
an
*NL*
infraction
of
the
rules
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
obtained
a
mediocre
consolation
at
best
,
--
permission
to
be
*NL*
interred
at
a
special
hour
and
in
a
special
corner
in
the
ancient
*NL*
Vaugirard
cemetery
,
which
was
made
of
land
which
had
formerly
belonged
*NL*
to
their
community
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Fridays
the
nuns
hear
high
mass
,
vespers
,
and
all
the
offices
,
as
on
*NL*
Sunday
.
They
scrupulously
observe
in
addition
all
the
little
festivals
*NL*
unknown
to
people
of
the
world
,
of
which
the
Church
of
France
was
so
*NL*
prodigal
in
the
olden
days
,
and
of
which
it
is
still
prodigal
in
Spain
*NL*
and
Italy
.
Their
stations
in
the
chapel
are
interminable
.
As
for
the
*NL*
number
and
duration
of
their
prayers
we
can
convey
no
better
idea
of
*NL*
them
than
by
quoting
the
ingenuous
remark
of
one
of
them
:
``
The
prayers
*NL*
of
the
postulants
are
frightful
,
the
prayers
of
the
novices
are
still
*NL*
worse
,
and
the
prayers
of
the
professed
nuns
are
still
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
a
week
the
chapter
assembles
:
the
prioress
presides
;
the
vocal
*NL*
mothers
assist
.
Each
sister
kneels
in
turn
on
the
stones
,
and
confesses
*NL*
aloud
,
in
the
presence
of
all
,
the
faults
and
sins
which
she
has
*NL*
committed
during
the
week
.
The
vocal
mothers
consult
after
each
*NL*
confession
and
inflict
the
penance
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
confession
in
a
loud
tone
,
for
which
all
faults
in
the
*NL*
least
serious
are
reserved
,
they
have
for
their
venial
offences
what
*NL*
they
call
the
coulpe
.
To
make
one
's
coulpe
means
to
prostrate
one
's
self
*NL*
flat
on
one
's
face
during
the
office
in
front
of
the
prioress
until
*NL*
the
latter
,
who
is
never
called
anything
but
our
mother
,
notifies
the
*NL*
culprit
by
a
slight
tap
of
her
foot
against
the
wood
of
her
stall
that
*NL*
she
can
rise
.
The
coulpe
or
peccavi
,
is
made
for
a
very
small
matter
--
a
*NL*
broken
glass
,
a
torn
veil
,
an
involuntary
delay
of
a
few
seconds
at
an
*NL*
office
,
a
false
note
in
church
,
etc.
;
this
suffices
,
and
the
coulpe
*NL*
is
made
.
The
coulpe
is
entirely
spontaneous
;
it
is
the
culpable
person
*NL*
herself
-LRB-
the
word
is
etymologically
in
its
place
here
-RRB-
who
judges
*NL*
herself
and
inflicts
it
on
herself
.
On
festival
days
and
Sundays
four
*NL*
mother
precentors
intone
the
offices
before
a
large
reading-desk
with
*NL*
four
places
.
One
day
one
of
the
mother
precentors
intoned
a
psalm
*NL*
beginning
with
Ecce
,
and
instead
of
Ecce
she
uttered
aloud
the
three
*NL*
notes
do
si
sol
;
for
this
piece
of
absent-mindedness
she
underwent
a
*NL*
coulpe
which
lasted
during
the
whole
service
:
what
rendered
the
fault
*NL*
enormous
was
the
fact
that
the
chapter
had
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
nun
is
summoned
to
the
parlor
,
even
were
it
the
prioress
herself
,
*NL*
she
drops
her
veil
,
as
will
be
remembered
,
so
that
only
her
mouth
is
*NL*
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
alone
can
hold
communication
with
strangers
.
The
others
can
*NL*
see
only
their
immediate
family
,
and
that
very
rarely
.
If
,
by
chance
,
*NL*
an
outsider
presents
herself
to
see
a
nun
,
or
one
whom
she
has
known
and
*NL*
loved
in
the
outer
world
,
a
regular
series
of
negotiations
is
required
.
*NL*
If
it
is
a
woman
,
the
authorization
may
sometimes
be
granted
;
the
nun
*NL*
comes
,
and
they
talk
to
her
through
the
shutters
,
which
are
opened
only
*NL*
for
a
mother
or
sister
.
It
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
permission
is
*NL*
always
refused
to
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
rule
of
Saint-Benoit
,
aggravated
by
Martin
Verga
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
nuns
are
not
gay
,
rosy
,
and
fresh
,
as
the
daughters
of
other
*NL*
orders
often
are
.
They
are
pale
and
grave
.
Between
1825
and
1830
three
*NL*
of
them
went
mad
.

CHAPTER
III
--
AUSTERITIES
*NL*
*NL*
One
is
a
postulant
for
two
years
at
least
,
often
for
four
;
a
novice
for
*NL*
four
.
It
is
rare
that
the
definitive
vows
can
be
pronounced
*NL*
earlier
than
the
age
of
twenty-three
or
twenty-four
years
.
The
*NL*
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
Martin
Verga
do
not
admit
widows
to
their
*NL*
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
cells
,
they
deliver
themselves
up
to
many
unknown
macerations
,
*NL*
of
which
they
must
never
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
a
novice
makes
her
profession
,
she
is
dressed
in
her
*NL*
handsomest
attire
,
she
is
crowned
with
white
roses
,
her
hair
is
brushed
*NL*
until
it
shines
,
and
curled
.
Then
she
prostrates
herself
;
a
great
black
*NL*
veil
is
thrown
over
her
,
and
the
office
for
the
dead
is
sung
.
Then
the
*NL*
nuns
separate
into
two
files
;
one
file
passes
close
to
her
,
saying
in
*NL*
plaintive
accents
,
``
Our
sister
is
dead
''
;
and
the
other
file
responds
in
*NL*
a
voice
of
ecstasy
,
``
Our
sister
is
alive
in
Jesus
Christ
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
epoch
when
this
story
takes
place
,
a
boarding-school
was
attached
*NL*
to
the
convent
--
a
boarding-school
for
young
girls
of
noble
and
*NL*
mostly
wealthy
families
,
among
whom
could
be
remarked
Mademoiselle
*NL*
de
Saint-Aulaire
and
de
Belissen
,
and
an
English
girl
bearing
the
*NL*
illustrious
Catholic
name
of
Talbot
.
These
young
girls
,
reared
by
these
*NL*
nuns
between
four
walls
,
grew
up
with
a
horror
of
the
world
and
of
the
*NL*
age
.
One
of
them
said
to
us
one
day
,
``
The
sight
of
the
street
pavement
*NL*
made
me
shudder
from
head
to
foot
.
''
They
were
dressed
in
blue
,
with
a
*NL*
white
cap
and
a
Holy
Spirit
of
silver
gilt
or
of
copper
on
their
breast
.
*NL*
On
certain
grand
festival
days
,
particularly
Saint
Martha
's
day
,
they
*NL*
were
permitted
,
as
a
high
favor
and
a
supreme
happiness
,
to
dress
*NL*
themselves
as
nuns
and
to
carry
out
the
offices
and
practice
of
*NL*
Saint-Benoit
for
a
whole
day
.
In
the
early
days
the
nuns
were
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
lending
them
their
black
garments
.
This
seemed
profane
,
and
*NL*
the
prioress
forbade
it
.
Only
the
novices
were
permitted
to
lend
.
It
is
*NL*
remarkable
that
these
performances
,
tolerated
and
encouraged
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
in
the
convent
out
of
a
secret
spirit
of
proselytism
and
in
order
*NL*
to
give
these
children
a
foretaste
of
the
holy
habit
,
were
a
genuine
*NL*
happiness
and
a
real
recreation
for
the
scholars
.
They
simply
amused
*NL*
themselves
with
it
.
It
was
new
;
it
gave
them
a
change
.
Candid
reasons
*NL*
of
childhood
,
which
do
not
,
however
,
succeed
in
making
us
worldlings
*NL*
comprehend
the
felicity
of
holding
a
holy
water
sprinkler
in
one
's
hand
*NL*
and
standing
for
hours
together
singing
hard
enough
for
four
in
front
of
*NL*
a
reading-desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pupils
conformed
,
with
the
exception
of
the
austerities
,
to
all
the
*NL*
practices
of
the
convent
.
There
was
a
certain
young
woman
who
entered
*NL*
the
world
,
and
who
after
many
years
of
married
life
had
not
succeeded
in
*NL*
breaking
herself
of
the
habit
of
saying
in
great
haste
whenever
any
*NL*
one
knocked
at
her
door
,
``
forever
!
''
Like
the
nuns
,
the
pupils
saw
*NL*
their
relatives
only
in
the
parlor
.
Their
very
mothers
did
not
obtain
*NL*
permission
to
embrace
them
.
The
following
illustrates
to
what
a
degree
*NL*
severity
on
that
point
was
carried
.
One
day
a
young
girl
received
a
*NL*
visit
from
her
mother
,
who
was
accompanied
by
a
little
sister
three
*NL*
years
of
age
.
The
young
girl
wept
,
for
she
wished
greatly
to
embrace
*NL*
her
sister
.
Impossible
.
She
begged
that
,
at
least
,
the
child
might
be
*NL*
permitted
to
pass
her
little
hand
through
the
bars
so
that
she
could
*NL*
kiss
it
.
This
was
almost
indignantly
refused
.

GAYETIES

*NL*
None
the
less
,
these
young
girls
filled
this
grave
house
with
charming
*NL*
souvenirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
certain
hours
childhood
sparkled
in
that
cloister
.
The
recreation
*NL*
hour
struck
.
A
door
swung
on
its
hinges
.
The
birds
said
,
``
Good
;
*NL*
here
come
the
children
!
''
An
irruption
of
youth
inundated
that
garden
*NL*
intersected
with
a
cross
like
a
shroud
.
Radiant
faces
,
white
foreheads
,
*NL*
innocent
eyes
,
full
of
merry
light
,
all
sorts
of
auroras
,
were
scattered
*NL*
about
amid
these
shadows
.
After
the
psalmodies
,
the
bells
,
the
peals
,
*NL*
and
knells
and
offices
,
the
sound
of
these
little
girls
burst
forth
on
a
*NL*
sudden
more
sweetly
than
the
noise
of
bees
.
The
hive
of
joy
was
opened
,
*NL*
and
each
one
brought
her
honey
.
They
played
,
they
called
to
each
other
,
*NL*
they
formed
into
groups
,
they
ran
about
;
pretty
little
white
teeth
*NL*
chattered
in
the
corners
;
the
veils
superintended
the
laughs
from
a
*NL*
distance
,
shades
kept
watch
of
the
sunbeams
,
but
what
mattered
it
?
Still
*NL*
they
beamed
and
laughed
.
Those
four
lugubrious
walls
had
their
moment
*NL*
of
dazzling
brilliancy
.
They
looked
on
,
vaguely
blanched
with
the
*NL*
reflection
of
so
much
joy
at
this
sweet
swarming
of
the
hives
.
It
was
*NL*
like
a
shower
of
roses
falling
athwart
this
house
of
mourning
.
The
young
*NL*
girls
frolicked
beneath
the
eyes
of
the
nuns
;
the
gaze
of
impeccability
*NL*
does
not
embarrass
innocence
.
Thanks
to
these
children
,
there
was
,
*NL*
among
so
many
austere
hours
,
one
hour
of
ingenuousness
.
The
little
ones
*NL*
skipped
about
;
the
elder
ones
danced
.
In
this
cloister
play
was
mingled
*NL*
with
heaven
.
Nothing
is
so
delightful
and
so
august
as
all
these
fresh
,
*NL*
expanding
young
souls
.
Homer
would
have
come
thither
to
laugh
with
*NL*
Perrault
;
and
there
was
in
that
black
garden
,
youth
,
health
,
noise
,
*NL*
cries
,
giddiness
,
pleasure
,
happiness
enough
to
smooth
out
the
wrinkles
*NL*
of
all
their
ancestresses
,
those
of
the
epic
as
well
as
those
of
the
*NL*
fairy-tale
,
those
of
the
throne
as
well
as
those
of
the
thatched
cottage
*NL*
from
Hecuba
to
la
Mere-Grand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
house
more
than
anywhere
else
,
perhaps
,
arise
those
children
's
*NL*
sayings
which
are
so
graceful
and
which
evoke
a
smile
that
is
full
of
*NL*
thoughtfulness
.
It
was
between
those
four
gloomy
walls
that
a
child
of
*NL*
five
years
exclaimed
one
day
:
``
Mother
!
one
of
the
big
girls
has
just
*NL*
told
me
that
I
have
only
nine
years
and
ten
months
longer
to
remain
*NL*
here
.
What
happiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
here
,
too
,
that
this
memorable
dialogue
took
place
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
A
Vocal
Mother
.
Why
are
you
weeping
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
-LRB-
aged
six
-RRB-
.
I
told
Alix
that
I
knew
my
French
history
.
She
*NL*
says
that
I
do
not
know
it
,
but
I
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alix
,
the
big
girl
-LRB-
aged
nine
-RRB-
.
No
;
she
does
not
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Mother
.
How
is
that
,
my
child
?
*NL*
*NL*
Alix
.
She
told
me
to
open
the
book
at
random
and
to
ask
her
any
question
*NL*
in
the
book
,
and
she
would
answer
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
not
answer
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
about
it
.
What
did
you
ask
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
opened
the
book
at
random
,
as
she
proposed
,
and
I
put
the
first
*NL*
question
that
I
came
across
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
the
question
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
,
`
What
happened
after
that
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
there
that
that
profound
remark
was
made
anent
a
rather
greedy
*NL*
paroquet
which
belonged
to
a
lady
boarder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
bred
!
it
eats
the
top
of
the
slice
of
bread
and
butter
just
*NL*
like
a
person
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
one
of
the
flagstones
of
this
cloister
that
there
was
once
*NL*
picked
up
a
confession
which
had
been
written
out
in
advance
,
in
order
*NL*
that
she
might
not
forget
it
,
by
a
sinner
of
seven
years
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
accuse
myself
of
having
been
avaricious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
accuse
myself
of
having
been
an
adulteress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
accuse
myself
of
having
raised
my
eyes
to
the
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
one
of
the
turf
benches
of
this
garden
that
a
rosy
mouth
six
*NL*
years
of
age
improvised
the
following
tale
,
which
was
listened
to
by
*NL*
blue
eyes
aged
four
and
five
years
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
were
three
little
cocks
who
owned
a
country
where
there
were
*NL*
a
great
many
flowers
.
They
plucked
the
flowers
and
put
them
in
their
*NL*
pockets
.
After
that
they
plucked
the
leaves
and
put
them
in
their
*NL*
playthings
.
There
was
a
wolf
in
that
country
;
there
was
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
forest
;
and
the
wolf
was
in
the
forest
;
and
he
ate
the
little
cocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
other
poem
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
came
a
blow
with
a
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Punchinello
who
bestowed
it
on
the
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
good
for
her
;
it
hurt
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
a
lady
put
Punchinello
in
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
there
that
a
little
abandoned
child
,
a
foundling
whom
the
convent
*NL*
was
bringing
up
out
of
charity
,
uttered
this
sweet
and
heart-breaking
*NL*
saying
.
She
heard
the
others
talking
of
their
mothers
,
and
she
murmured
*NL*
in
her
corner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
me
,
my
mother
was
not
there
when
I
was
born
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stout
portress
who
could
always
be
seen
hurrying
through
the
*NL*
corridors
with
her
bunch
of
keys
,
and
whose
name
was
Sister
Agatha
.
The
*NL*
big
big
girls
--
those
over
ten
years
of
age
--
called
her
Agathocles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
refectory
,
a
large
apartment
of
an
oblong
square
form
,
which
*NL*
received
no
light
except
through
a
vaulted
cloister
on
a
level
with
the
*NL*
garden
,
was
dark
and
damp
,
and
,
as
the
children
say
,
full
of
beasts
.
All
*NL*
the
places
round
about
furnished
their
contingent
of
insects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
of
its
four
corners
had
received
,
in
the
language
of
the
pupils
,
*NL*
a
special
and
expressive
name
.
There
was
Spider
corner
,
Caterpillar
*NL*
corner
,
Wood-louse
corner
,
and
Cricket
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cricket
corner
was
near
the
kitchen
and
was
highly
esteemed
.
It
was
not
*NL*
so
cold
there
as
elsewhere
.
From
the
refectory
the
names
had
passed
to
*NL*
the
boarding-school
,
and
there
served
as
in
the
old
College
Mazarin
*NL*
to
distinguish
four
nations
.
Every
pupil
belonged
to
one
of
these
four
*NL*
nations
according
to
the
corner
of
the
refectory
in
which
she
sat
at
*NL*
meals
.
One
day
Monseigneur
the
Archbishop
while
making
his
pastoral
*NL*
visit
saw
a
pretty
little
rosy
girl
with
beautiful
golden
hair
enter
the
*NL*
class-room
through
which
he
was
passing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inquired
of
another
pupil
,
a
charming
brunette
with
rosy
cheeks
,
who
*NL*
stood
near
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
spider
,
Monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
And
that
one
yonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
cricket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
a
caterpillar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
!
and
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
wood-louse
,
Monseigneur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
house
of
this
sort
has
its
own
peculiarities
.
At
the
beginning
of
*NL*
this
century
Ecouen
was
one
of
those
strict
and
graceful
places
where
*NL*
young
girls
pass
their
childhood
in
a
shadow
that
is
almost
august
.
At
*NL*
Ecouen
,
in
order
to
take
rank
in
the
procession
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
,
*NL*
a
distinction
was
made
between
virgins
and
florists
.
There
were
also
the
*NL*
``
dais
''
and
the
``
censors
,
''
--
the
first
who
held
the
cords
of
the
dais
,
and
*NL*
the
others
who
carried
incense
before
the
Holy
Sacrament
.
The
flowers
*NL*
belonged
by
right
to
the
florists
.
Four
``
virgins
''
walked
in
advance
.
On
*NL*
the
morning
of
that
great
day
it
was
no
rare
thing
to
hear
the
question
*NL*
put
in
the
dormitory
,
``
Who
is
a
virgin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Campan
used
to
quote
this
saying
of
a
``
little
one
''
of
seven
*NL*
years
,
to
a
``
big
girl
''
of
sixteen
,
who
took
the
head
of
the
procession
,
*NL*
while
she
,
the
little
one
,
remained
at
the
rear
,
``
You
are
a
virgin
,
but
*NL*
I
am
not
.

CHAPTER
V

DISTRACTIONS
*NL*
*NL*
Above
the
door
of
the
refectory
this
prayer
,
which
was
called
the
white
*NL*
Paternoster
,
and
which
possessed
the
property
of
bearing
people
straight
*NL*
to
paradise
,
was
inscribed
in
large
black
letters
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
white
Paternoster
,
which
God
made
,
which
God
said
,
which
God
*NL*
placed
in
paradise
.
In
the
evening
,
when
I
went
to
bed
,
I
found
three
*NL*
angels
sitting
on
my
bed
,
one
at
the
foot
,
two
at
the
head
,
the
good
*NL*
Virgin
Mary
in
the
middle
,
who
told
me
to
lie
down
without
hesitation
.
*NL*
The
good
God
is
my
father
,
the
good
Virgin
is
my
mother
,
the
three
*NL*
apostles
are
my
brothers
,
the
three
virgins
are
my
sisters
.
The
shirt
in
*NL*
which
God
was
born
envelopes
my
body
;
Saint
Margaret
's
cross
is
written
*NL*
on
my
breast
.
Madame
the
Virgin
was
walking
through
the
meadows
,
weeping
*NL*
for
God
,
when
she
met
M.
Saint
John
.
`
Monsieur
Saint
John
,
whence
come
*NL*
you
?
'
'
I
come
from
Ave
Salus
.
'
`
You
have
not
seen
the
good
God
;
where
*NL*
is
he
?
'
`
He
is
on
the
tree
of
the
Cross
,
his
feet
hanging
,
his
hands
*NL*
nailed
,
a
little
cap
of
white
thorns
on
his
head
.
'
Whoever
shall
say
*NL*
this
thrice
at
eventide
,
thrice
in
the
morning
,
shall
win
paradise
at
*NL*
the
last
.

In
1827
this
characteristic
orison
had
disappeared
from
the
wall
under
*NL*
a
triple
coating
of
daubing
paint
.
At
the
present
time
it
is
finally
*NL*
disappearing
from
the
memories
of
several
who
were
young
girls
then
,
and
*NL*
who
are
old
women
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
crucifix
fastened
to
the
wall
completed
the
decoration
of
this
*NL*
refectory
,
whose
only
door
,
as
we
think
we
have
mentioned
,
opened
on
the
*NL*
garden
.
Two
narrow
tables
,
each
flanked
by
two
wooden
benches
,
formed
*NL*
two
long
parallel
lines
from
one
end
to
the
other
of
the
refectory
.
*NL*
The
walls
were
white
,
the
tables
were
black
;
these
two
mourning
colors
*NL*
constitute
the
only
variety
in
convents
.
The
meals
were
plain
,
and
*NL*
the
food
of
the
children
themselves
severe
.
A
single
dish
of
meat
and
*NL*
vegetables
combined
,
or
salt
fish
--
such
was
their
luxury
.
This
meagre
*NL*
fare
,
which
was
reserved
for
the
pupils
alone
,
was
,
nevertheless
,
an
*NL*
exception
.
The
children
ate
in
silence
,
under
the
eye
of
the
mother
*NL*
whose
turn
it
was
,
who
,
if
a
fly
took
a
notion
to
fly
or
to
hum
against
*NL*
the
rule
,
opened
and
shut
a
wooden
book
from
time
to
time
.
This
silence
*NL*
was
seasoned
with
the
lives
of
the
saints
,
read
aloud
from
a
little
*NL*
pulpit
with
a
desk
,
which
was
situated
at
the
foot
of
the
crucifix
.
The
*NL*
reader
was
one
of
the
big
girls
,
in
weekly
turn
.
At
regular
distances
,
*NL*
on
the
bare
tables
,
there
were
large
,
varnished
bowls
in
which
the
*NL*
pupils
washed
their
own
silver
cups
and
knives
and
forks
,
and
into
which
*NL*
they
sometimes
threw
some
scrap
of
tough
meat
or
spoiled
fish
;
this
was
*NL*
punished
.
These
bowls
were
called
ronds
d'eau
.
The
child
who
broke
the
*NL*
silence
``
made
a
cross
with
her
tongue
.
''
Where
?
On
the
ground
.
She
licked
*NL*
the
pavement
.
The
dust
,
that
end
of
all
joys
,
was
charged
with
the
*NL*
chastisement
of
those
poor
little
rose-leaves
which
had
been
guilty
of
*NL*
chirping
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
the
convent
a
book
which
has
never
been
printed
except
as
*NL*
a
unique
copy
,
and
which
it
is
forbidden
to
read
.
It
is
the
rule
of
*NL*
Saint-Benoit
.
An
arcanum
which
no
profane
eye
must
penetrate
.
Nemo
*NL*
regulas
,
seu
constitutiones
nostras
,
externis
communicabit
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pupils
one
day
succeeded
in
getting
possession
of
this
book
,
and
set
*NL*
to
reading
it
with
avidity
,
a
reading
which
was
often
interrupted
by
*NL*
the
fear
of
being
caught
,
which
caused
them
to
close
the
volume
*NL*
precipitately
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
great
danger
thus
incurred
they
derived
but
a
very
moderate
*NL*
amount
of
pleasure
.
The
most
``
interesting
thing
''
they
found
were
some
*NL*
unintelligible
pages
about
the
sins
of
young
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
played
in
an
alley
of
the
garden
bordered
with
a
few
shabby
*NL*
fruit-trees
.
In
spite
of
the
extreme
surveillance
and
the
severity
of
*NL*
the
punishments
administered
,
when
the
wind
had
shaken
the
trees
,
they
*NL*
sometimes
succeeded
in
picking
up
a
green
apple
or
a
spoiled
apricot
or
*NL*
an
inhabited
pear
on
the
sly
.
I
will
now
cede
the
privilege
of
speech
*NL*
to
a
letter
which
lies
before
me
,
a
letter
written
five
and
twenty
*NL*
years
ago
by
an
old
pupil
,
now
Madame
la
Duchesse
de
--
one
of
the
most
*NL*
elegant
women
in
Paris
.
I
quote
literally
:
``
One
hides
one
's
pear
or
*NL*
one
's
apple
as
best
one
may
.
When
one
goes
up
stairs
to
put
the
veil
on
*NL*
the
bed
before
supper
,
one
stuffs
them
under
one
's
pillow
and
at
night
*NL*
one
eats
them
in
bed
,
and
when
one
can
not
do
that
,
one
eats
them
in
the
*NL*
closet
.
''
That
was
one
of
their
greatest
luxuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
--
it
was
at
the
epoch
of
the
visit
from
the
archbishop
to
the
*NL*
convent
--
one
of
the
young
girls
,
Mademoiselle
Bouchard
,
who
was
*NL*
connected
with
the
Montmorency
family
,
laid
a
wager
that
she
would
ask
*NL*
for
a
day
's
leave
of
absence
--
an
enormity
in
so
austere
a
community
.
The
*NL*
wager
was
accepted
,
but
not
one
of
those
who
bet
believed
that
she
would
*NL*
do
it
.
When
the
moment
came
,
as
the
archbishop
was
passing
in
front
of
*NL*
the
pupils
,
Mademoiselle
Bouchard
,
to
the
indescribable
terror
of
her
*NL*
companions
,
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
,
and
said
,
``
Monseigneur
,
a
day
's
*NL*
leave
of
absence
.
''
Mademoiselle
Bouchard
was
tall
,
blooming
,
with
the
*NL*
prettiest
little
rosy
face
in
the
world
.
M.
de
Quelen
smiled
and
said
,
*NL*
``
What
,
my
dear
child
,
a
day
's
leave
of
absence
!
Three
days
if
you
like
.
*NL*
I
grant
you
three
days
.
''
The
prioress
could
do
nothing
;
the
archbishop
*NL*
had
spoken
.
Horror
of
the
convent
,
but
joy
of
the
pupil
.
The
effect
may
*NL*
be
imagined
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stern
cloister
was
not
so
well
walled
off
,
however
,
but
that
the
*NL*
life
of
the
passions
of
the
outside
world
,
drama
,
and
even
romance
,
*NL*
did
not
make
their
way
in
.
To
prove
this
,
we
will
confine
ourselves
to
*NL*
recording
here
and
to
briefly
mentioning
a
real
and
incontestable
fact
,
*NL*
which
,
however
,
bears
no
reference
in
itself
to
,
and
is
not
connected
by
*NL*
any
thread
whatever
with
the
story
which
we
are
relating
.
We
mention
the
*NL*
fact
for
the
sake
of
completing
the
physiognomy
of
the
convent
in
the
*NL*
reader
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
time
there
was
in
the
convent
a
mysterious
person
who
was
*NL*
not
a
nun
,
who
was
treated
with
great
respect
,
and
who
was
addressed
as
*NL*
Madame
Albertine
.
Nothing
was
known
about
her
,
save
that
she
was
mad
,
*NL*
and
that
in
the
world
she
passed
for
dead
.
Beneath
this
history
it
*NL*
was
said
there
lay
the
arrangements
of
fortune
necessary
for
a
great
*NL*
marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
,
hardly
thirty
years
of
age
,
of
dark
complexion
and
tolerably
*NL*
pretty
,
had
a
vague
look
in
her
large
black
eyes
.
Could
she
see
?
There
*NL*
was
some
doubt
about
this
.
She
glided
rather
than
walked
,
she
never
*NL*
spoke
;
it
was
not
quite
known
whether
she
breathed
.
Her
nostrils
were
*NL*
livid
and
pinched
as
after
yielding
up
their
last
sigh
.
To
touch
her
*NL*
hand
was
like
touching
snow
.
She
possessed
a
strange
spectral
grace
.
*NL*
Wherever
she
entered
,
people
felt
cold
.
One
day
a
sister
,
on
seeing
her
*NL*
pass
,
said
to
another
sister
,
``
She
passes
for
a
dead
woman
.
''
``
Perhaps
*NL*
she
is
one
,
''
replied
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hundred
tales
were
told
of
Madame
Albertine
.
This
arose
from
the
*NL*
eternal
curiosity
of
the
pupils
.
In
the
chapel
there
was
a
gallery
*NL*
called
L'OEil
de
Boeuf
.
It
was
in
this
gallery
,
which
had
only
a
*NL*
circular
bay
,
an
oeil
de
boeuf
,
that
Madame
Albertine
listened
to
the
*NL*
offices
.
She
always
occupied
it
alone
because
from
this
gallery
,
being
*NL*
on
the
level
of
the
first
story
,
the
preacher
or
the
officiating
priest
*NL*
could
be
seen
,
which
was
interdicted
to
the
nuns
.
One
day
the
pulpit
was
*NL*
occupied
by
a
young
priest
of
high
rank
,
M.
Le
Duc
de
Rohan
,
peer
of
*NL*
France
,
officer
of
the
Red
Musketeers
in
1815
when
he
was
Prince
de
*NL*
Leon
,
and
who
died
afterward
,
in
1830
,
as
cardinal
and
Archbishop
of
*NL*
Besancon
.
It
was
the
first
time
that
M.
de
Rohan
had
preached
at
the
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
convent
.
Madame
Albertine
usually
preserved
perfect
*NL*
calmness
and
complete
immobility
during
the
sermons
and
services
.
That
*NL*
day
,
as
soon
as
she
caught
sight
of
M.
de
Rohan
,
she
half
rose
,
and
*NL*
said
,
in
a
loud
voice
,
amid
the
silence
of
the
chapel
,
``
Ah
!
Auguste
!
''
*NL*
The
whole
community
turned
their
heads
in
amazement
,
the
preacher
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
,
but
Madame
Albertine
had
relapsed
into
her
immobility
.
A
*NL*
breath
from
the
outer
world
,
a
flash
of
life
,
had
passed
for
an
instant
*NL*
across
that
cold
and
lifeless
face
and
had
then
vanished
,
and
the
mad
*NL*
woman
had
become
a
corpse
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
two
words
,
however
,
had
set
every
one
in
the
convent
who
had
the
*NL*
privilege
of
speech
to
chattering
.
How
many
things
were
contained
in
*NL*
that
``
Ah
!
Auguste
!
''
what
revelations
!
M.
de
Rohan
's
name
really
was
*NL*
Auguste
.
It
was
evident
that
Madame
Albertine
belonged
to
the
very
*NL*
highest
society
,
since
she
knew
M.
de
Rohan
,
and
that
her
own
rank
there
*NL*
was
of
the
highest
,
since
she
spoke
thus
familiarly
of
so
great
a
lord
,
*NL*
and
that
there
existed
between
them
some
connection
,
of
relationship
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
a
very
close
one
in
any
case
,
since
she
knew
his
``
pet
*NL*
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
very
severe
duchesses
,
Mesdames
de
Choiseul
and
de
Serent
,
often
*NL*
visited
the
community
,
whither
they
penetrated
,
no
doubt
,
in
virtue
of
*NL*
the
privilege
Magnates
mulieres
,
and
caused
great
consternation
in
the
*NL*
boarding-school
.
When
these
two
old
ladies
passed
by
,
all
the
poor
young
*NL*
girls
trembled
and
dropped
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
M.
de
Rohan
,
quite
unknown
to
himself
,
was
an
object
of
*NL*
attention
to
the
school-girls
.
At
that
epoch
he
had
just
been
made
,
*NL*
while
waiting
for
the
episcopate
,
vicar-general
of
the
Archbishop
of
*NL*
Paris
.
It
was
one
of
his
habits
to
come
tolerably
often
to
celebrate
the
*NL*
offices
in
the
chapel
of
the
nuns
of
the
Petit-Picpus
.
Not
one
of
the
*NL*
young
recluses
could
see
him
,
because
of
the
serge
curtain
,
but
he
had
*NL*
a
sweet
and
rather
shrill
voice
,
which
they
had
come
to
know
and
to
*NL*
distinguish
.
He
had
been
a
mousquetaire
,
and
then
,
he
was
said
to
be
*NL*
very
coquettish
,
that
his
handsome
brown
hair
was
very
well
dressed
in
*NL*
a
roll
around
his
head
,
and
that
he
had
a
broad
girdle
of
magnificent
*NL*
moire
,
and
that
his
black
cassock
was
of
the
most
elegant
cut
in
the
*NL*
world
.
He
held
a
great
place
in
all
these
imaginations
of
sixteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
sound
from
without
made
its
way
into
the
convent
.
But
there
was
*NL*
one
year
when
the
sound
of
a
flute
penetrated
thither
.
This
was
an
*NL*
event
,
and
the
girls
who
were
at
school
there
at
the
time
still
recall
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
flute
which
was
played
in
the
neighborhood
.
This
flute
always
*NL*
played
the
same
air
,
an
air
which
is
very
far
away
nowadays
,
--
``
My
*NL*
Zetulbe
,
come
reign
o'er
my
soul
,
''
--
and
it
was
heard
two
or
three
*NL*
times
a
day
.
The
young
girls
passed
hours
in
listening
to
it
,
the
vocal
*NL*
mothers
were
upset
by
it
,
brains
were
busy
,
punishments
descended
in
*NL*
showers
.
This
lasted
for
several
months
.
The
girls
were
all
more
or
*NL*
less
in
love
with
the
unknown
musician
.
Each
one
dreamed
that
she
was
*NL*
Zetulbe
.
The
sound
of
the
flute
proceeded
from
the
direction
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Droit-Mur
;
and
they
would
have
given
anything
,
compromised
everything
,
*NL*
attempted
anything
for
the
sake
of
seeing
,
of
catching
a
glance
,
if
only
*NL*
for
a
second
,
of
the
``
young
man
''
who
played
that
flute
so
deliciously
,
*NL*
and
who
,
no
doubt
,
played
on
all
these
souls
at
the
same
time
.
There
*NL*
were
some
who
made
their
escape
by
a
back
door
,
and
ascended
to
the
*NL*
third
story
on
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
side
,
in
order
to
attempt
to
catch
a
*NL*
glimpse
through
the
gaps
.
Impossible
!
One
even
went
so
far
as
to
thrust
*NL*
her
arm
through
the
grating
,
and
to
wave
her
white
handkerchief
.
Two
*NL*
were
still
bolder
.
They
found
means
to
climb
on
a
roof
,
and
risked
their
*NL*
lives
there
,
and
succeeded
at
last
in
seeing
``
the
young
man
.
''
He
was
an
*NL*
old
emigre
gentleman
,
blind
and
penniless
,
who
was
playing
his
flute
in
*NL*
his
attic
,
in
order
to
pass
the
time
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
LITTLE
CONVENT
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
enclosure
of
the
Petit-Picpus
there
were
three
perfectly
*NL*
distinct
buildings
,
--
the
Great
Convent
,
inhabited
by
the
nuns
,
the
*NL*
Boarding-school
,
where
the
scholars
were
lodged
;
and
lastly
,
what
was
*NL*
called
the
Little
Convent
.
It
was
a
building
with
a
garden
,
in
which
*NL*
lived
all
sorts
of
aged
nuns
of
various
orders
,
the
relics
of
cloisters
*NL*
destroyed
in
the
Revolution
;
a
reunion
of
all
the
black
,
gray
,
and
white
*NL*
medleys
of
all
communities
and
all
possible
varieties
;
what
might
be
*NL*
called
,
if
such
a
coupling
of
words
is
permissible
,
a
sort
of
harlequin
*NL*
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Empire
was
established
,
all
these
poor
old
dispersed
and
exiled
*NL*
women
had
been
accorded
permission
to
come
and
take
shelter
under
the
*NL*
wings
of
the
Bernardines-Benedictines
.
The
government
paid
them
a
small
*NL*
pension
,
the
ladies
of
the
Petit-Picpus
received
them
cordially
.
It
was
*NL*
a
singular
pell-mell
.
Each
followed
her
own
rule
,
Sometimes
the
pupils
*NL*
of
the
boarding-school
were
allowed
,
as
a
great
recreation
,
to
pay
them
*NL*
a
visit
;
the
result
is
,
that
all
those
young
memories
have
*NL*
retained
among
other
souvenirs
that
of
Mother
Sainte-Bazile
,
Mother
*NL*
Sainte-Scolastique
,
and
Mother
Jacob
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
refugees
found
herself
almost
at
home
.
She
was
a
nun
of
*NL*
Sainte-Aure
,
the
only
one
of
her
order
who
had
survived
.
The
ancient
*NL*
convent
of
the
ladies
of
Sainte-Aure
occupied
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
eighteenth
century
,
this
very
house
of
the
Petit-Picpus
,
which
belonged
*NL*
later
to
the
Benedictines
of
Martin
Verga
.
This
holy
woman
,
too
poor
to
*NL*
wear
the
magnificent
habit
of
her
order
,
which
was
a
white
robe
with
*NL*
a
scarlet
scapulary
,
had
piously
put
it
on
a
little
manikin
,
which
she
*NL*
exhibited
with
complacency
and
which
she
bequeathed
to
the
house
at
*NL*
her
death
.
In
1824
,
only
one
nun
of
this
order
remained
;
to-day
,
there
*NL*
remains
only
a
doll
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
these
worthy
mothers
,
some
old
society
women
had
obtained
*NL*
permission
of
the
prioress
,
like
Madame
Albertine
,
to
retire
into
the
*NL*
Little
Convent
.
Among
the
number
were
Madame
Beaufort
d'Hautpoul
and
*NL*
Marquise
Dufresne
.
Another
was
never
known
in
the
convent
except
by
*NL*
the
formidable
noise
which
she
made
when
she
blew
her
nose
.
The
pupils
*NL*
called
her
Madame
Vacarmini
-LRB-
hubbub
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
1820
or
1821
,
Madame
de
Genlis
,
who
was
at
that
time
editing
a
*NL*
little
periodical
publication
called
l'Intrepide
,
asked
to
be
allowed
*NL*
to
enter
the
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus
as
lady
resident
.
The
Duc
*NL*
d'Orleans
recommended
her
.
Uproar
in
the
hive
;
the
vocal-mothers
were
*NL*
all
in
a
flutter
;
Madame
de
Genlis
had
made
romances
.
But
she
declared
*NL*
that
she
was
the
first
to
detest
them
,
and
then
,
she
had
reached
her
*NL*
fierce
stage
of
devotion
.
With
the
aid
of
God
,
and
of
the
Prince
,
she
*NL*
entered
.
She
departed
at
the
end
of
six
or
eight
months
,
alleging
as
a
*NL*
reason
,
that
there
was
no
shade
in
the
garden
.
The
nuns
were
delighted
.
*NL*
Although
very
old
,
she
still
played
the
harp
,
and
did
it
very
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
away
she
left
her
mark
in
her
cell
.
Madame
de
Genlis
was
*NL*
superstitious
and
a
Latinist
.
These
two
words
furnish
a
tolerably
good
*NL*
profile
of
her
.
A
few
years
ago
,
there
were
still
to
be
seen
,
pasted
in
*NL*
the
inside
of
a
little
cupboard
in
her
cell
in
which
she
locked
up
her
*NL*
silverware
and
her
jewels
,
these
five
lines
in
Latin
,
written
with
*NL*
her
own
hand
in
red
ink
on
yellow
paper
,
and
which
,
in
her
opinion
,
*NL*
possessed
the
property
of
frightening
away
robbers
:

These
verses
in
sixth
century
Latin
raise
the
question
whether
the
*NL*
two
thieves
of
Calvary
were
named
,
as
is
commonly
believed
,
Dismas
and
*NL*
Gestas
,
or
Dismas
and
Gesmas
.
This
orthography
might
have
confounded
the
*NL*
pretensions
put
forward
in
the
last
century
by
the
Vicomte
de
Gestas
,
of
*NL*
a
descent
from
the
wicked
thief
.
However
,
the
useful
virtue
attached
to
*NL*
these
verses
forms
an
article
of
faith
in
the
order
of
the
Hospitallers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
of
the
house
,
constructed
in
such
a
manner
as
to
separate
the
*NL*
Great
Convent
from
the
Boarding-school
like
a
veritable
intrenchment
,
*NL*
was
,
of
course
,
common
to
the
Boarding-school
,
the
Great
Convent
,
and
*NL*
the
Little
Convent
.
The
public
was
even
admitted
by
a
sort
of
lazaretto
*NL*
entrance
on
the
street
.
But
all
was
so
arranged
,
that
none
of
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
cloister
could
see
a
face
from
the
outside
world
.
*NL*
Suppose
a
church
whose
choir
is
grasped
in
a
gigantic
hand
,
and
*NL*
folded
in
such
a
manner
as
to
form
,
not
,
as
in
ordinary
churches
,
a
*NL*
prolongation
behind
the
altar
,
but
a
sort
of
hall
,
or
obscure
cellar
,
to
*NL*
the
right
of
the
officiating
priest
;
suppose
this
hall
to
be
shut
off
by
*NL*
a
curtain
seven
feet
in
height
,
of
which
we
have
already
spoken
;
in
the
*NL*
shadow
of
that
curtain
,
pile
up
on
wooden
stalls
the
nuns
in
the
choir
*NL*
on
the
left
,
the
school-girls
on
the
right
,
the
lay-sisters
and
the
*NL*
novices
at
the
bottom
,
and
you
will
have
some
idea
of
the
nuns
of
the
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
assisting
at
divine
service
.
That
cavern
,
which
was
called
*NL*
the
choir
,
communicated
with
the
cloister
by
a
lobby
.
The
church
was
*NL*
lighted
from
the
garden
.
When
the
nuns
were
present
at
services
where
*NL*
their
rule
enjoined
silence
,
the
public
was
warned
of
their
presence
*NL*
only
by
the
folding
seats
of
the
stalls
noisily
rising
and
falling
.

SOME
SILHOUETTES
OF
THIS
DARKNESS
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
six
years
which
separate
1819
from
1825
,
the
prioress
of
the
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
was
Mademoiselle
de
Blemeur
,
whose
name
,
in
religion
,
*NL*
was
Mother
Innocente
.
She
came
of
the
family
of
Marguerite
de
Blemeur
,
*NL*
author
of
Lives
of
the
Saints
of
the
Order
of
Saint-Benoit
.
She
had
*NL*
been
re-elected
.
She
was
a
woman
about
sixty
years
of
age
,
short
,
thick
,
*NL*
``
singing
like
a
cracked
pot
,
''
says
the
letter
which
we
have
already
*NL*
quoted
;
an
excellent
woman
,
moreover
,
and
the
only
merry
one
in
the
*NL*
whole
convent
,
and
for
that
reason
adored
.
She
was
learned
,
erudite
,
*NL*
wise
,
competent
,
curiously
proficient
in
history
,
crammed
with
Latin
,
*NL*
stuffed
with
Greek
,
full
of
Hebrew
,
and
more
of
a
Benedictine
monk
than
*NL*
a
Benedictine
nun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sub-prioress
was
an
old
Spanish
nun
,
Mother
Cineres
,
who
was
almost
*NL*
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
esteemed
among
the
vocal
mothers
were
Mother
Sainte-Honorine
;
*NL*
the
treasurer
,
Mother
Sainte-Gertrude
,
the
chief
mistress
of
the
*NL*
novices
;
Mother-Saint-Ange
,
the
assistant
mistress
;
Mother
Annonciation
,
*NL*
the
sacristan
;
Mother
Saint-Augustin
,
the
nurse
,
the
only
one
in
the
*NL*
convent
who
was
malicious
;
then
Mother
Sainte-Mechtilde
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Gauvain
-RRB-
,
very
young
and
with
a
beautiful
voice
;
Mother
des
Anges
*NL*
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
Drouet
-RRB-
,
who
had
been
in
the
convent
of
the
Filles-Dieu
,
*NL*
and
in
the
convent
du
Tresor
,
between
Gisors
and
Magny
;
Mother
*NL*
Saint-Joseph
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
de
Cogolludo
-RRB-
,
Mother
Sainte-Adelaide
*NL*
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
d'Auverney
-RRB-
,
Mother
Misericorde
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Cifuentes
,
who
could
not
resist
austerities
-RRB-
,
Mother
Compassion
*NL*
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
de
la
Miltiere
,
received
at
the
age
of
sixty
in
defiance
*NL*
of
the
rule
,
and
very
wealthy
-RRB-
;
Mother
Providence
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Laudiniere
-RRB-
,
Mother
Presentation
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
de
Siguenza
-RRB-
,
who
was
*NL*
prioress
in
1847
;
and
finally
,
Mother
Sainte-Celigne
-LRB-
sister
of
the
*NL*
sculptor
Ceracchi
-RRB-
,
who
went
mad
;
Mother
Sainte-Chantal
-LRB-
Mademoiselle
de
*NL*
Suzon
-RRB-
,
who
went
mad
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
also
,
among
the
prettiest
of
them
,
a
charming
girl
of
three
*NL*
and
twenty
,
who
was
from
the
Isle
de
Bourbon
,
a
descendant
of
the
*NL*
Chevalier
Roze
,
whose
name
had
been
Mademoiselle
Roze
,
and
who
was
*NL*
called
Mother
Assumption
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Sainte-Mechtilde
,
intrusted
with
the
singing
and
the
choir
,
was
*NL*
fond
of
making
use
of
the
pupils
in
this
quarter
.
She
usually
took
a
*NL*
complete
scale
of
them
,
that
is
to
say
,
seven
,
from
ten
to
sixteen
years
*NL*
of
age
,
inclusive
,
of
assorted
voices
and
sizes
,
whom
she
made
sing
*NL*
standing
,
drawn
up
in
a
line
,
side
by
side
,
according
to
age
,
from
the
*NL*
smallest
to
the
largest
.
This
presented
to
the
eye
,
something
in
the
*NL*
nature
of
a
reed-pipe
of
young
girls
,
a
sort
of
living
Pan-pipe
made
of
*NL*
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
of
the
lay-sisters
whom
the
scholars
loved
most
were
Sister
*NL*
Euphrasie
,
Sister
Sainte-Marguerite
,
Sister
Sainte-Marthe
,
who
was
in
*NL*
her
dotage
,
and
Sister
Sainte-Michel
,
whose
long
nose
made
them
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
women
were
gentle
with
the
children
.
The
nuns
were
severe
only
*NL*
towards
themselves
.
No
fire
was
lighted
except
in
the
school
,
and
the
*NL*
food
was
choice
compared
to
that
in
the
convent
.
Moreover
,
they
lavished
*NL*
a
thousand
cares
on
their
scholars
.
Only
,
when
a
child
passed
near
a
nun
*NL*
and
addressed
her
,
the
nun
never
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rule
of
silence
had
had
this
effect
,
that
throughout
the
whole
*NL*
convent
,
speech
had
been
withdrawn
from
human
creatures
,
and
bestowed
*NL*
on
inanimate
objects
.
Now
it
was
the
church-bell
which
spoke
,
now
it
was
*NL*
the
gardener
's
bell
.
A
very
sonorous
bell
,
placed
beside
the
portress
,
*NL*
and
which
was
audible
throughout
the
house
,
indicated
by
its
varied
*NL*
peals
,
which
formed
a
sort
of
acoustic
telegraph
,
all
the
actions
of
*NL*
material
life
which
were
to
be
performed
,
and
summoned
to
the
parlor
,
in
*NL*
case
of
need
,
such
or
such
an
inhabitant
of
the
house
.
Each
person
*NL*
and
each
thing
had
its
own
peal
.
The
prioress
had
one
and
one
,
the
*NL*
sub-prioress
one
and
two
.
Six-five
announced
lessons
,
so
that
the
pupils
*NL*
never
said
``
to
go
to
lessons
,
''
but
``
to
go
to
six-five
.
''
Four-four
was
*NL*
Madame
de
Genlis
's
signal
.
It
was
very
often
heard
.
``
C'est
le
diable
*NL*
a
quatre
,
''
--
it
's
the
very
deuce
--
said
the
uncharitable
.
Tennine
strokes
*NL*
announced
a
great
event
.
It
was
the
opening
of
the
door
of
seclusion
,
*NL*
a
frightful
sheet
of
iron
bristling
with
bolts
which
only
turned
on
its
*NL*
hinges
in
the
presence
of
the
archbishop
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
the
archbishop
and
the
gardener
,
no
man
entered
*NL*
the
convent
,
as
we
have
already
said
.
The
schoolgirls
saw
two
others
:
*NL*
one
,
the
chaplain
,
the
Abbe
Banes
,
old
and
ugly
,
whom
they
were
*NL*
permitted
to
contemplate
in
the
choir
,
through
a
grating
;
the
other
the
*NL*
drawing-master
,
M.
Ansiaux
,
whom
the
letter
,
of
which
we
have
perused
a
*NL*
few
lines
,
calls
M.
Anciot
,
and
describes
as
a
frightful
old
hunchback
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
seen
that
all
these
men
were
carefully
chosen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
this
curious
house
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
POST
CORDA
LAPIDES
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
sketched
its
moral
face
,
it
will
not
prove
unprofitable
*NL*
to
point
out
,
in
a
few
words
,
its
material
configuration
.
The
reader
*NL*
already
has
some
idea
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus-Sainte-Antoine
filled
almost
the
whole
*NL*
of
the
vast
trapezium
which
resulted
from
the
intersection
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Polonceau
,
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
,
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
,
and
the
unused
lane
,
*NL*
called
Rue
Aumarais
on
old
plans
.
These
four
streets
surrounded
this
*NL*
trapezium
like
a
moat
.
The
convent
was
composed
of
several
buildings
*NL*
and
a
garden
.
The
principal
building
,
taken
in
its
entirety
,
was
a
*NL*
juxtaposition
of
hybrid
constructions
which
,
viewed
from
a
bird
's
-
eye
*NL*
view
,
outlined
,
with
considerable
exactness
,
a
gibbet
laid
flat
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
The
main
arm
of
the
gibbet
occupied
the
whole
of
the
fragment
*NL*
of
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
comprised
between
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
and
the
Rue
*NL*
Polonceau
;
the
lesser
arm
was
a
lofty
,
gray
,
severe
grated
facade
which
*NL*
faced
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
;
the
carriage
entrance
No.
62
marked
its
*NL*
extremity
.
Towards
the
centre
of
this
facade
was
a
low
,
arched
door
,
*NL*
whitened
with
dust
and
ashes
,
where
the
spiders
wove
their
webs
,
*NL*
and
which
was
open
only
for
an
hour
or
two
on
Sundays
,
and
on
rare
*NL*
occasions
,
when
the
coffin
of
a
nun
left
the
convent
.
This
was
the
*NL*
public
entrance
of
the
church
.
The
elbow
of
the
gibbet
was
a
square
*NL*
hall
which
was
used
as
the
servants
'
hall
,
and
which
the
nuns
called
the
*NL*
buttery
.
In
the
main
arm
were
the
cells
of
the
mothers
,
the
sisters
,
and
*NL*
the
novices
.
In
the
lesser
arm
lay
the
kitchens
,
the
refectory
,
backed
*NL*
up
by
the
cloisters
and
the
church
.
Between
the
door
No.
62
and
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
closed
lane
Aumarais
,
was
the
school
,
which
was
not
*NL*
visible
from
without
.
The
remainder
of
the
trapezium
formed
the
garden
,
*NL*
which
was
much
lower
than
the
level
of
the
Rue
Polonceau
,
which
caused
*NL*
the
walls
to
be
very
much
higher
on
the
inside
than
on
the
outside
.
The
*NL*
garden
,
which
was
slightly
arched
,
had
in
its
centre
,
on
the
summit
of
*NL*
a
hillock
,
a
fine
pointed
and
conical
fir-tree
,
whence
ran
,
as
from
*NL*
the
peaked
boss
of
a
shield
,
four
grand
alleys
,
and
,
ranged
by
twos
*NL*
in
between
the
branchings
of
these
,
eight
small
ones
,
so
that
,
if
the
*NL*
enclosure
had
been
circular
,
the
geometrical
plan
of
the
alleys
would
*NL*
have
resembled
a
cross
superposed
on
a
wheel
.
As
the
alleys
all
ended
*NL*
in
the
very
irregular
walls
of
the
garden
,
they
were
of
unequal
length
.
*NL*
They
were
bordered
with
currant
bushes
.
At
the
bottom
,
an
alley
of
tall
*NL*
poplars
ran
from
the
ruins
of
the
old
convent
,
which
was
at
the
angle
of
*NL*
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
to
the
house
of
the
Little
Convent
,
which
was
at
the
*NL*
angle
of
the
Aumarais
lane
.
In
front
of
the
Little
Convent
was
what
was
*NL*
called
the
little
garden
.
To
this
whole
,
let
the
reader
add
a
courtyard
,
*NL*
all
sorts
of
varied
angles
formed
by
the
interior
buildings
,
prison
*NL*
walls
,
the
long
black
line
of
roofs
which
bordered
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Polonceau
for
its
sole
perspective
and
neighborhood
,
and
he
will
*NL*
be
able
to
form
for
himself
a
complete
image
of
what
the
house
of
the
*NL*
Bernardines
of
the
Petit-Picpus
was
forty
years
ago
.
This
holy
house
*NL*
had
been
built
on
the
precise
site
of
a
famous
tennis-ground
of
the
*NL*
fourteenth
to
the
sixteenth
century
,
which
was
called
the
``
tennis-ground
*NL*
of
the
eleven
thousand
devils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
streets
,
moreover
,
were
more
ancient
than
Paris
.
These
names
,
*NL*
Droit-Mur
and
Aumarais
,
are
very
ancient
;
the
streets
which
bear
them
*NL*
are
very
much
more
ancient
still
.
Aumarais
Lane
was
called
Maugout
Lane
;
*NL*
the
Rue
Droit-Mur
was
called
the
Rue
des
Eglantiers
,
for
God
opened
*NL*
flowers
before
man
cut
stones

CHAPTER
IX
--
A
CENTURY
UNDER
A
GUIMPE
*NL*
*NL*
Since
we
are
engaged
in
giving
details
as
to
what
the
convent
of
the
*NL*
Petit-Picpus
was
in
former
times
,
and
since
we
have
ventured
to
open
*NL*
a
window
on
that
discreet
retreat
,
the
reader
will
permit
us
one
other
*NL*
little
digression
,
utterly
foreign
to
this
book
,
but
characteristic
and
*NL*
useful
,
since
it
shows
that
the
cloister
even
has
its
original
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Little
Convent
there
was
a
centenarian
who
came
from
the
Abbey
*NL*
of
Fontevrault
.
She
had
even
been
in
society
before
the
Revolution
.
She
*NL*
talked
a
great
deal
of
M.
de
Miromesnil
,
Keeper
of
the
Seals
under
Louis
*NL*
XVI
.
and
of
a
Presidentess
Duplat
,
with
whom
she
had
been
very
intimate
.
*NL*
It
was
her
pleasure
and
her
vanity
to
drag
in
these
names
on
every
*NL*
pretext
.
She
told
wonders
of
the
Abbey
of
Fontevrault
,
--
that
it
was
like
*NL*
a
city
,
and
that
there
were
streets
in
the
monastery
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
talked
with
a
Picard
accent
which
amused
the
pupils
.
Every
year
,
*NL*
she
solemnly
renewed
her
vows
,
and
at
the
moment
of
taking
the
oath
,
she
*NL*
said
to
the
priest
,
``
Monseigneur
Saint-Francois
gave
it
to
Monseigneur
*NL*
Saint-Julien
,
Monseigneur
Saint-Julien
gave
it
to
Monseigneur
*NL*
Saint-Eusebius
,
Monseigneur
Saint-Eusebius
gave
it
to
Monseigneur
*NL*
Saint-Procopius
,
etc.
,
etc.
;
and
thus
I
give
it
to
you
,
father
.
''
And
the
*NL*
school-girls
would
begin
to
laugh
,
not
in
their
sleeves
,
but
under
*NL*
their
veils
;
charming
little
stifled
laughs
which
made
the
vocal
mothers
*NL*
frown
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
,
the
centenarian
was
telling
stories
.
She
said
*NL*
that
in
her
youth
the
Bernardine
monks
were
every
whit
as
good
as
the
*NL*
mousquetaires
.
It
was
a
century
which
spoke
through
her
,
but
it
was
the
*NL*
eighteenth
century
.
She
told
about
the
custom
of
the
four
wines
,
which
*NL*
existed
before
the
Revolution
in
Champagne
and
Bourgogne
.
When
a
great
*NL*
personage
,
a
marshal
of
France
,
a
prince
,
a
duke
,
and
a
peer
,
traversed
*NL*
a
town
in
Burgundy
or
Champagne
,
the
city
fathers
came
out
to
harangue
*NL*
him
and
presented
him
with
four
silver
gondolas
into
which
they
*NL*
had
poured
four
different
sorts
of
wine
.
On
the
first
goblet
this
*NL*
inscription
could
be
read
,
monkey
wine
;
on
the
second
,
lion
wine
;
on
the
*NL*
third
,
sheep
wine
;
on
the
fourth
,
hog
wine
.
These
four
legends
express
*NL*
the
four
stages
descended
by
the
drunkard
;
the
first
,
intoxication
,
*NL*
which
enlivens
;
the
second
,
that
which
irritates
;
the
third
,
that
which
*NL*
dulls
;
and
the
fourth
,
that
which
brutalizes
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
cupboard
,
under
lock
and
key
,
she
kept
a
mysterious
object
of
which
*NL*
she
thought
a
great
deal
.
The
rule
of
Fontevrault
did
not
forbid
this
.
*NL*
She
would
not
show
this
object
to
anyone
.
She
shut
herself
up
,
which
her
*NL*
rule
allowed
her
to
do
,
and
hid
herself
,
every
time
that
she
desired
to
*NL*
contemplate
it
.
If
she
heard
a
footstep
in
the
corridor
,
she
closed
the
*NL*
cupboard
again
as
hastily
as
it
was
possible
with
her
aged
hands
.
As
*NL*
soon
as
it
was
mentioned
to
her
,
she
became
silent
,
she
who
was
so
fond
*NL*
of
talking
.
The
most
curious
were
baffled
by
her
silence
and
the
most
*NL*
tenacious
by
her
obstinacy
.
Thus
it
furnished
a
subject
of
comment
for
*NL*
all
those
who
were
unoccupied
or
bored
in
the
convent
.
What
could
that
*NL*
treasure
of
the
centenarian
be
,
which
was
so
precious
and
so
secret
?
*NL*
Some
holy
book
,
no
doubt
?
Some
unique
chaplet
?
Some
authentic
relic
?
*NL*
They
lost
themselves
in
conjectures
.
When
the
poor
old
woman
died
,
*NL*
they
rushed
to
her
cupboard
more
hastily
than
was
fitting
,
perhaps
,
and
*NL*
opened
it
.
They
found
the
object
beneath
a
triple
linen
cloth
,
like
some
*NL*
consecrated
paten
.
It
was
a
Faenza
platter
representing
little
Loves
*NL*
flitting
away
pursued
by
apothecary
lads
armed
with
enormous
syringes
.
*NL*
The
chase
abounds
in
grimaces
and
in
comical
postures
.
One
of
the
*NL*
charming
little
Loves
is
already
fairly
spitted
.
He
is
resisting
,
*NL*
fluttering
his
tiny
wings
,
and
still
making
an
effort
to
fly
,
but
the
*NL*
dancer
is
laughing
with
a
satanical
air
.
Moral
:
Love
conquered
by
the
*NL*
colic
.
This
platter
,
which
is
very
curious
,
and
which
had
,
possibly
,
*NL*
the
honor
of
furnishing
Moliere
with
an
idea
,
was
still
in
existence
*NL*
in
September
,
1845
;
it
was
for
sale
by
a
bric-a-brac
merchant
in
the
*NL*
Boulevard
Beaumarchais
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
good
old
woman
would
not
receive
any
visits
from
outside
because
,
*NL*
said
she
,
the
parlor
is
too
gloomy
.

CHAPTER
X
--
ORIGIN
OF
THE
PERPETUAL
ADORATION
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
almost
sepulchral
parlor
,
of
which
we
have
sought
to
*NL*
convey
an
idea
,
is
a
purely
local
trait
which
is
not
reproduced
with
the
*NL*
same
severity
in
other
convents
.
At
the
convent
of
the
Rue
du
Temple
,
*NL*
in
particular
,
which
belonged
,
in
truth
,
to
another
order
,
the
black
*NL*
shutters
were
replaced
by
brown
curtains
,
and
the
parlor
itself
was
a
*NL*
salon
with
a
polished
wood
floor
,
whose
windows
were
draped
in
white
*NL*
muslin
curtains
and
whose
walls
admitted
all
sorts
of
frames
,
a
portrait
*NL*
of
a
Benedictine
nun
with
unveiled
face
,
painted
bouquets
,
and
even
the
*NL*
head
of
a
Turk
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
that
garden
of
the
Temple
convent
,
that
stood
that
famous
*NL*
chestnut-tree
which
was
renowned
as
the
finest
and
the
largest
in
*NL*
France
,
and
which
bore
the
reputation
among
the
good
people
of
the
*NL*
eighteenth
century
of
being
the
father
of
all
the
chestnut
trees
of
the
*NL*
realm
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
,
this
convent
of
the
Temple
was
occupied
by
Benedictines
*NL*
of
the
Perpetual
Adoration
,
Benedictines
quite
different
from
those
who
*NL*
depended
on
Citeaux
.
This
order
of
the
Perpetual
Adoration
is
not
very
*NL*
ancient
and
does
not
go
back
more
than
two
hundred
years
.
In
1649
the
*NL*
holy
sacrament
was
profaned
on
two
occasions
a
few
days
apart
,
in
two
*NL*
churches
in
Paris
,
at
Saint-Sulpice
and
at
Saint-Jean
en
Greve
,
a
rare
*NL*
and
frightful
sacrilege
which
set
the
whole
town
in
an
uproar
.
M.
the
*NL*
Prior
and
Vicar-General
of
Saint-Germain
des
Pres
ordered
a
solemn
*NL*
procession
of
all
his
clergy
,
in
which
the
Pope
's
Nuncio
officiated
.
*NL*
But
this
expiation
did
not
satisfy
two
sainted
women
,
Madame
Courtin
,
*NL*
Marquise
de
Boucs
,
and
the
Comtesse
de
Chateauvieux
.
This
outrage
*NL*
committed
on
``
the
most
holy
sacrament
of
the
altar
,
''
though
but
*NL*
temporary
,
would
not
depart
from
these
holy
souls
,
and
it
seemed
to
*NL*
them
that
it
could
only
be
extenuated
by
a
``
Perpetual
Adoration
''
in
some
*NL*
female
monastery
.
Both
of
them
,
one
in
1652
,
the
other
in
1653
,
made
*NL*
donations
of
notable
sums
to
Mother
Catherine
de
Bar
,
called
of
the
Holy
*NL*
Sacrament
,
a
Benedictine
nun
,
for
the
purpose
of
founding
,
to
this
pious
*NL*
end
,
a
monastery
of
the
order
of
Saint-Benoit
;
the
first
permission
for
*NL*
this
foundation
was
given
to
Mother
Catherine
de
Bar
by
M.
de
Metz
,
Abbe
*NL*
of
Saint-Germain
,
``
on
condition
that
no
woman
could
be
received
unless
*NL*
she
contributed
three
hundred
livres
income
,
which
amounts
to
six
*NL*
thousand
livres
,
to
the
principal
.
''
After
the
Abbe
of
Saint-Germain
,
the
*NL*
king
accorded
letters-patent
;
and
all
the
rest
,
abbatial
charter
,
and
*NL*
royal
letters
,
was
confirmed
in
1654
by
the
Chamber
of
Accounts
and
the
*NL*
Parliament
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
origin
of
the
legal
consecration
of
the
establishment
of
the
*NL*
Benedictines
of
the
Perpetual
Adoration
of
the
Holy
Sacrament
at
Paris
.
*NL*
Their
first
convent
was
``
a
new
building
''
in
the
Rue
Cassette
,
out
of
the
*NL*
contributions
of
Mesdames
de
Boucs
and
de
Chateauvieux
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
order
,
as
it
will
be
seen
,
was
not
to
be
confounded
with
*NL*
the
Benedictine
nuns
of
Citeaux
.
It
mounted
back
to
the
Abbe
of
*NL*
Saint-Germain
des
Pres
,
in
the
same
manner
that
the
ladies
of
the
Sacred
*NL*
Heart
go
back
to
the
general
of
the
Jesuits
,
and
the
sisters
of
charity
*NL*
to
the
general
of
the
Lazarists
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
also
totally
different
from
the
Bernardines
of
the
Petit-Picpus
,
*NL*
whose
interior
we
have
just
shown
.
In
1657
,
Pope
Alexander
VII
.
had
*NL*
authorized
,
by
a
special
brief
,
the
Bernardines
of
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
,
*NL*
to
practise
the
Perpetual
Adoration
like
the
Benedictine
nuns
of
the
*NL*
Holy
Sacrament
.
But
the
two
orders
remained
distinct
none
the
less
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
END
OF
THE
PETIT-PICPUS
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
the
Restoration
,
the
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus
*NL*
was
in
its
decay
;
this
forms
a
part
of
the
general
death
of
the
order
,
*NL*
which
,
after
the
eighteenth
century
,
has
been
disappearing
like
all
*NL*
the
religious
orders
.
Contemplation
is
,
like
prayer
,
one
of
humanity
's
*NL*
needs
;
but
,
like
everything
which
the
Revolution
touched
,
it
will
be
*NL*
transformed
,
and
from
being
hostile
to
social
progress
,
it
will
become
*NL*
favorable
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
of
the
Petit-Picpus
was
becoming
rapidly
depopulated
.
In
1840
,
*NL*
the
Little
Convent
had
disappeared
,
the
school
had
disappeared
.
There
*NL*
were
no
longer
any
old
women
,
nor
young
girls
;
the
first
were
dead
,
the
*NL*
latter
had
taken
their
departure
.
Volaverunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rule
of
the
Perpetual
Adoration
is
so
rigid
in
its
nature
that
it
*NL*
alarms
,
vocations
recoil
before
it
,
the
order
receives
no
recruits
.
In
*NL*
1845
,
it
still
obtained
lay-sisters
here
and
there
.
But
of
professed
*NL*
nuns
,
none
at
all
.
Forty
years
ago
,
the
nuns
numbered
nearly
a
hundred
;
*NL*
fifteen
years
ago
there
were
not
more
than
twenty-eight
of
them
.
How
*NL*
many
are
there
to-day
?
In
1847
,
the
prioress
was
young
,
a
sign
that
*NL*
the
circle
of
choice
was
restricted
.
She
was
not
forty
years
old
.
In
*NL*
proportion
as
the
number
diminishes
,
the
fatigue
increases
,
the
service
*NL*
of
each
becomes
more
painful
;
the
moment
could
then
be
seen
drawing
near
*NL*
when
there
would
be
but
a
dozen
bent
and
aching
shoulders
to
bear
the
*NL*
heavy
rule
of
Saint-Benoit
.
The
burden
is
implacable
,
and
remains
the
*NL*
same
for
the
few
as
for
the
many
.
It
weighs
down
,
it
crushes
.
Thus
they
*NL*
die
.
At
the
period
when
the
author
of
this
book
still
lived
in
Paris
,
*NL*
two
died
.
One
was
twenty-five
years
old
,
the
other
twenty-three
.
This
*NL*
latter
can
say
,
like
Julia
Alpinula
:
``
Hic
jaceo
.
Vixi
annos
viginti
et
*NL*
tres
.
''
It
is
in
consequence
of
this
decay
that
the
convent
gave
up
the
*NL*
education
of
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
not
felt
able
to
pass
before
this
extraordinary
house
without
*NL*
entering
it
,
and
without
introducing
the
minds
which
accompany
us
,
and
*NL*
which
are
listening
to
our
tale
,
to
the
profit
of
some
,
perchance
,
of
*NL*
the
melancholy
history
of
Jean
Valjean
.
We
have
penetrated
into
this
*NL*
community
,
full
of
those
old
practices
which
seem
so
novel
to-day
.
It
*NL*
is
the
closed
garden
,
hortus
conclusus
.
We
have
spoken
of
this
singular
*NL*
place
in
detail
,
but
with
respect
,
in
so
far
,
at
least
,
as
detail
and
*NL*
respect
are
compatible
.
We
do
not
understand
all
,
but
we
insult
nothing
.
*NL*
We
are
equally
far
removed
from
the
hosanna
of
Joseph
de
Maistre
,
who
*NL*
wound
up
by
anointing
the
executioner
,
and
from
the
sneer
of
Voltaire
,
*NL*
who
even
goes
so
far
as
to
ridicule
the
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
illogical
act
on
Voltaire
's
part
,
we
may
remark
,
by
the
way
;
for
*NL*
Voltaire
would
have
defended
Jesus
as
he
defended
Calas
;
and
even
*NL*
for
those
who
deny
superhuman
incarnations
,
what
does
the
crucifix
*NL*
represent
?
The
assassinated
sage
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
nineteenth
century
,
the
religious
idea
is
undergoing
a
crisis
.
*NL*
People
are
unlearning
certain
things
,
and
they
do
well
,
provided
that
,
*NL*
while
unlearning
them
they
learn
this
:
There
is
no
vacuum
in
the
human
*NL*
heart
.
Certain
demolitions
take
place
,
and
it
is
well
that
they
do
,
but
*NL*
on
condition
that
they
are
followed
by
reconstructions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
let
us
study
things
which
are
no
more
.
It
is
necessary
*NL*
to
know
them
,
if
only
for
the
purpose
of
avoiding
them
.
The
counterfeits
*NL*
of
the
past
assume
false
names
,
and
gladly
call
themselves
the
future
.
*NL*
This
spectre
,
this
past
,
is
given
to
falsifying
its
own
passport
.
Let
*NL*
us
inform
ourselves
of

CHAPTER

--
THE
CONVENT
AS
AN
ABSTRACT
IDEA
*NL*
*NL*
This
book
is
a
drama
,
whose
leading
personage
is
the
Infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
is
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
being
the
case
,
and
a
convent
having
happened
to
be
on
our
road
,
it
*NL*
has
been
our
duty
to
enter
it
.
Why
?
Because
the
convent
,
which
is
common
*NL*
to
the
Orient
as
well
as
to
the
Occident
,
to
antiquity
as
well
as
to
*NL*
modern
times
,
to
paganism
,
to
Buddhism
,
to
Mahometanism
,
as
well
as
to
*NL*
Christianity
,
is
one
of
the
optical
apparatuses
applied
by
man
to
the
*NL*
Infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
not
the
place
for
enlarging
disproportionately
on
certain
*NL*
ideas
;
nevertheless
,
while
absolutely
maintaining
our
reserves
,
our
*NL*
restrictions
,
and
even
our
indignations
,
we
must
say
that
every
time
we
*NL*
encounter
man
in
the
Infinite
,
either
well
or
ill
understood
,
we
feel
*NL*
ourselves
overpowered
with
respect
.
There
is
,
in
the
synagogue
,
in
the
*NL*
mosque
,
in
the
pagoda
,
in
the
wigwam
,
a
hideous
side
which
we
execrate
,
*NL*
and
a
sublime
side
,
which
we
adore
.
What
a
contemplation
for
the
mind
,
*NL*
and
what
endless
food
for
thought
,
is
the
reverberation
of
God
upon
the
*NL*
human
wall
!

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
CONVENT
AS
AN
HISTORICAL
FACT
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
point
of
view
of
history
,
of
reason
,
and
of
truth
,
monasticism
*NL*
is
condemned
.
Monasteries
,
when
they
abound
in
a
nation
,
are
clogs
in
*NL*
its
circulation
,
cumbrous
establishments
,
centres
of
idleness
where
*NL*
centres
of
labor
should
exist
.
Monastic
communities
are
to
the
great
*NL*
social
community
what
the
mistletoe
is
to
the
oak
,
what
the
wart
is
*NL*
to
the
human
body
.
Their
prosperity
and
their
fatness
mean
the
*NL*
impoverishment
of
the
country
.
The
monastic
regime
,
good
at
the
*NL*
beginning
of
civilization
,
useful
in
the
reduction
of
the
brutal
by
the
*NL*
spiritual
,
is
bad
when
peoples
have
reached
their
manhood
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
when
it
becomes
relaxed
,
and
when
it
enters
into
its
period
of
disorder
,
*NL*
it
becomes
bad
for
the
very
reasons
which
rendered
it
salutary
in
its
*NL*
period
of
purity
,
because
it
still
continues
to
set
the
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
Claustration
has
had
its
day
.
Cloisters
,
useful
in
the
early
education
*NL*
of
modern
civilization
,
have
embarrassed
its
growth
,
and
are
injurious
*NL*
to
its
development
.
So
far
as
institution
and
formation
with
relation
*NL*
to
man
are
concerned
,
monasteries
,
which
were
good
in
the
tenth
century
,
*NL*
questionable
in
the
fifteenth
,
are
detestable
in
the
nineteenth
.
The
*NL*
leprosy
of
monasticism
has
gnawed
nearly
to
a
skeleton
two
wonderful
*NL*
nations
,
Italy
and
Spain
;
the
one
the
light
,
the
other
the
splendor
of
*NL*
Europe
for
centuries
;
and
,
at
the
present
day
,
these
two
illustrious
*NL*
peoples
are
but
just
beginning
to
convalesce
,
thanks
to
the
healthy
and
*NL*
vigorous
hygiene
of
1789
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
convent
--
the
ancient
female
convent
in
particular
,
such
as
it
still
*NL*
presents
itself
on
the
threshold
of
this
century
,
in
Italy
,
in
Austria
,
*NL*
in
Spain
--
is
one
of
the
most
sombre
concretions
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
The
*NL*
cloister
,
that
cloister
,
is
the
point
of
intersection
of
horrors
.
The
*NL*
Catholic
cloister
,
properly
speaking
,
is
wholly
filled
with
the
black
*NL*
radiance
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Spanish
convent
is
the
most
funereal
of
all
.
There
rise
,
in
*NL*
obscurity
,
beneath
vaults
filled
with
gloom
,
beneath
domes
vague
with
*NL*
shadow
,
massive
altars
of
Babel
,
as
high
as
cathedrals
;
there
immense
*NL*
white
crucifixes
hang
from
chains
in
the
dark
;
there
are
extended
,
all
*NL*
nude
on
the
ebony
,
great
Christs
of
ivory
;
more
than
bleeding
,
--
bloody
;
*NL*
hideous
and
magnificent
,
with
their
elbows
displaying
the
bones
,
their
*NL*
knee-pans
showing
their
integuments
,
their
wounds
showing
their
flesh
,
*NL*
crowned
with
silver
thorns
,
nailed
with
nails
of
gold
,
with
blood
drops
*NL*
of
rubies
on
their
brows
,
and
diamond
tears
in
their
eyes
.
The
diamonds
*NL*
and
rubies
seem
wet
,
and
make
veiled
beings
in
the
shadow
below
weep
,
*NL*
their
sides
bruised
with
the
hair
shirt
and
their
iron-tipped
scourges
,
*NL*
their
breasts
crushed
with
wicker
hurdles
,
their
knees
excoriated
with
*NL*
prayer
;
women
who
think
themselves
wives
,
spectres
who
think
themselves
*NL*
seraphim
.
Do
these
women
think
?
No
.
Have
they
any
will
?
No
.
Do
they
*NL*
love
?
No
.
Do
they
live
?
No
.
Their
nerves
have
turned
to
bone
;
their
*NL*
bones
have
turned
to
stone
.
Their
veil
is
of
woven
night
.
Their
breath
*NL*
under
their
veil
resembles
the
indescribably
tragic
respiration
of
*NL*
death
.
The
abbess
,
a
spectre
,
sanctifies
them
and
terrifies
them
.
*NL*
The
immaculate
one
is
there
,
and
very
fierce
.
Such
are
the
ancient
*NL*
monasteries
of
Spain
.
Lairs
of
terrible
devotion
,
caverns
of
virgins
,
*NL*
ferocious
places
.
*NL*
*NL*
Catholic
Spain
is
more
Roman
than
Rome
herself
.
The
Spanish
convent
was
,
*NL*
above
all
others
,
the
Catholic
convent
.
There
was
a
flavor
of
the
Orient
*NL*
about
it
.
The
archbishop
,
the
kislar-aga
of
heaven
,
locked
up
and
kept
*NL*
watch
over
this
seraglio
of
souls
reserved
for
God
.
The
nun
was
the
*NL*
odalisque
,
the
priest
was
the
eunuch
.
The
fervent
were
chosen
in
dreams
*NL*
and
possessed
Christ
.
At
night
,
the
beautiful
,
nude
young
man
descended
*NL*
from
the
cross
and
became
the
ecstasy
of
the
cloistered
one
.
Lofty
walls
*NL*
guarded
the
mystic
sultana
,
who
had
the
crucified
for
her
sultan
,
from
*NL*
all
living
distraction
.
A
glance
on
the
outer
world
was
infidelity
.
The
*NL*
in
pace
replaced
the
leather
sack
.
That
which
was
cast
into
the
sea
in
*NL*
the
East
was
thrown
into
the
ground
in
the
West
.
In
both
quarters
,
women
*NL*
wrung
their
hands
;
the
waves
for
the
first
,
the
grave
for
the
last
;
here
*NL*
the
drowned
,
there
the
buried
.
Monstrous
parallel
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
the
upholders
of
the
past
,
unable
to
deny
these
things
,
have
*NL*
adopted
the
expedient
of
smiling
at
them
.
There
has
come
into
fashion
*NL*
a
strange
and
easy
manner
of
suppressing
the
revelations
of
history
,
of
*NL*
invalidating
the
commentaries
of
philosophy
,
of
eliding
all
embarrassing
*NL*
facts
and
all
gloomy
questions
.
A
matter
for
declamations
,
say
the
*NL*
clever
.
Declamations
,
repeat
the
foolish
.
Jean-Jacques
a
declaimer
;
*NL*
Diderot
a
declaimer
;
Voltaire
on
Calas
,
Labarre
,
and
Sirven
,
declaimers
.
*NL*
I
know
not
who
has
recently
discovered
that
Tacitus
was
a
declaimer
,
*NL*
that
Nero
was
a
victim
,
and
that
pity
is
decidedly
due
to
``
that
poor
*NL*
Holofernes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Facts
,
however
,
are
awkward
things
to
disconcert
,
and
they
are
*NL*
obstinate
.
The
author
of
this
book
has
seen
,
with
his
own
eyes
,
eight
*NL*
leagues
distant
from
Brussels
,
--
there
are
relics
of
the
Middle
Ages
*NL*
there
which
are
attainable
for
everybody
,
--
at
the
Abbey
of
Villers
,
the
*NL*
hole
of
the
oubliettes
,
in
the
middle
of
the
field
which
was
formerly
*NL*
the
courtyard
of
the
cloister
,
and
on
the
banks
of
the
Thil
,
four
stone
*NL*
dungeons
,
half
under
ground
,
half
under
the
water
.
They
were
in
pace
.
*NL*
Each
of
these
dungeons
has
the
remains
of
an
iron
door
,
a
vault
,
and
a
*NL*
grated
opening
which
,
on
the
outside
,
is
two
feet
above
the
level
of
the
*NL*
river
,
and
on
the
inside
,
six
feet
above
the
level
of
the
ground
.
Four
*NL*
feet
of
river
flow
past
along
the
outside
wall
.
The
ground
is
always
*NL*
soaked
.
The
occupant
of
the
in
pace
had
this
wet
soil
for
his
bed
.
In
*NL*
one
of
these
dungeons
,
there
is
a
fragment
of
an
iron
necklet
riveted
to
*NL*
the
wall
;
in
another
,
there
can
be
seen
a
square
box
made
of
four
slabs
*NL*
of
granite
,
too
short
for
a
person
to
lie
down
in
,
too
low
for
him
to
*NL*
stand
upright
in
.
A
human
being
was
put
inside
,
with
a
coverlid
of
stone
*NL*
on
top
.
This
exists
.
It
can
be
seen
.
It
can
be
touched
.
These
in
pace
,
*NL*
these
dungeons
,
these
iron
hinges
,
these
necklets
,
that
lofty
peep-hole
*NL*
on
a
level
with
the
river
's
current
,
that
box
of
stone
closed
with
a
lid
*NL*
of
granite
like
a
tomb
,
with
this
difference
,
that
the
dead
man
here
*NL*
was
a
living
being
,
that
soil
which
is
but
mud
,
that
vault
hole
,
those
*NL*
oozing
walls
,
--
what
declaimers
!

CHAPTER
III
--
ON
WHAT
CONDITIONS
ONE
CAN
RESPECT
THE
PAST
*NL*
*NL*
Monasticism
,
such
as
it
existed
in
Spain
,
and
such
as
it
still
exists
in
*NL*
Thibet
,
is
a
sort
of
phthisis
for
civilization
.
It
stops
life
short
.
It
*NL*
simply
depopulates
.
Claustration
,
castration
.
It
has
been
the
scourge
*NL*
of
Europe
.
Add
to
this
the
violence
so
often
done
to
the
conscience
,
the
*NL*
forced
vocations
,
feudalism
bolstered
up
by
the
cloister
,
the
right
of
*NL*
the
first-born
pouring
the
excess
of
the
family
into
monasticism
,
the
*NL*
ferocities
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
,
the
in
pace
,
the
closed
mouths
,
*NL*
the
walled-up
brains
,
so
many
unfortunate
minds
placed
in
the
dungeon
*NL*
of
eternal
vows
,
the
taking
of
the
habit
,
the
interment
of
living
souls
.
*NL*
Add
individual
tortures
to
national
degradations
,
and
,
whoever
you
*NL*
may
be
,
you
will
shudder
before
the
frock
and
the
veil
,
--
those
two
*NL*
winding-sheets
of
human
devising
.
Nevertheless
,
at
certain
points
and
in
*NL*
certain
places
,
in
spite
of
philosophy
,
in
spite
of
progress
,
the
spirit
*NL*
of
the
cloister
persists
in
the
midst
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
*NL*
a
singular
ascetic
recrudescence
is
,
at
this
moment
,
astonishing
*NL*
the
civilized
world
.
The
obstinacy
of
antiquated
institutions
in
*NL*
perpetuating
themselves
resembles
the
stubbornness
of
the
rancid
perfume
*NL*
which
should
claim
our
hair
,
the
pretensions
of
the
spoiled
fish
which
*NL*
should
persist
in
being
eaten
,
the
persecution
of
the
child
's
garment
*NL*
which
should
insist
on
clothing
the
man
,
the
tenderness
of
corpses
which
*NL*
should
return
to
embrace
the
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ingrates
!
''
says
the
garment
,
``
I
protected
you
in
inclement
weather
.
Why
*NL*
will
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
me
?
''
``
I
have
just
come
from
the
deep
*NL*
sea
,
''
says
the
fish
.
``
I
have
been
a
rose
,
''
says
the
perfume
.
``
I
have
*NL*
loved
you
,
''
says
the
corpse
.
``
I
have
civilized
you
,
''
says
the
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
there
is
but
one
reply
:
``
In
former
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
dream
of
the
indefinite
prolongation
of
defunct
things
,
and
of
the
*NL*
government
of
men
by
embalming
,
to
restore
dogmas
in
a
bad
condition
,
*NL*
to
regild
shrines
,
to
patch
up
cloisters
,
to
rebless
reliquaries
,
to
*NL*
refurnish
superstitions
,
to
revictual
fanaticisms
,
to
put
new
handles
*NL*
on
holy
water
brushes
and
militarism
,
to
reconstitute
monasticism
and
*NL*
militarism
,
to
believe
in
the
salvation
of
society
by
the
multiplication
*NL*
of
parasites
,
to
force
the
past
on
the
present
,
--
this
seems
strange
.
*NL*
Still
,
there
are
theorists
who
hold
such
theories
.
These
theorists
,
*NL*
who
are
in
other
respects
people
of
intelligence
,
have
a
very
simple
*NL*
process
;
they
apply
to
the
past
a
glazing
which
they
call
social
*NL*
order
,
divine
right
,
morality
,
family
,
the
respect
of
elders
,
antique
*NL*
authority
,
sacred
tradition
,
legitimacy
,
religion
;
and
they
go
about
*NL*
shouting
,
``
Look
!
take
this
,
honest
people
.
''
This
logic
was
known
to
the
*NL*
ancients
.
The
soothsayers
practise
it
.
They
rubbed
a
black
heifer
over
*NL*
with
chalk
,
and
said
,
``
She
is
white
,
Bos
cretatus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
us
,
we
respect
the
past
here
and
there
,
and
we
spare
it
,
above
*NL*
all
,
provided
that
it
consents
to
be
dead
.
If
it
insists
on
being
alive
,
*NL*
we
attack
it
,
and
we
try
to
kill
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Superstitions
,
bigotries
,
affected
devotion
,
prejudices
,
those
forms
all
*NL*
forms
as
they
are
,
are
tenacious
of
life
;
they
have
teeth
and
nails
in
*NL*
their
smoke
,
and
they
must
be
clasped
close
,
body
to
body
,
and
war
must
*NL*
be
made
on
them
,
and
that
without
truce
;
for
it
is
one
of
the
fatalities
*NL*
of
humanity
to
be
condemned
to
eternal
combat
with
phantoms
.
It
is
*NL*
difficult
to
seize
darkness
by
the
throat
,
and
to
hurl
it
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
convent
in
France
,
in
the
broad
daylight
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
is
*NL*
a
college
of
owls
facing
the
light
.
A
cloister
,
caught
in
the
very
act
*NL*
of
asceticism
,
in
the
very
heart
of
the
city
of
'89
and
of
1830
and
*NL*
of
1848
,
Rome
blossoming
out
in
Paris
,
is
an
anachronism
.
In
ordinary
*NL*
times
,
in
order
to
dissolve
an
anachronism
and
to
cause
it
to
vanish
,
*NL*
one
has
only
to
make
it
spell
out
the
date
.
But
we
are
not
in
ordinary
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
fight
,
but
let
us
make
a
distinction
.
The
peculiar
property
of
*NL*
truth
is
never
to
commit
excesses
.
What
need
has
it
of
exaggeration
?
*NL*
There
is
that
which
it
is
necessary
to
destroy
,
and
there
is
that
which
*NL*
it
is
simply
necessary
to
elucidate
and
examine
.
What
a
force
is
kindly
*NL*
and
serious
examination
!
Let
us
not
apply
a
flame
where
only
a
light
is
*NL*
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
given
the
nineteenth
century
,
we
are
opposed
,
as
a
general
*NL*
proposition
,
and
among
all
peoples
,
in
Asia
as
well
as
in
Europe
,
*NL*
in
India
as
well
as
in
Turkey
,
to
ascetic
claustration
.
Whoever
says
*NL*
cloister
,
says
marsh
.
Their
putrescence
is
evident
,
their
stagnation
is
*NL*
unhealthy
,
their
fermentation
infects
people
with
fever
,
and
etiolates
*NL*
them
;
their
multiplication
becomes
a
plague
of
Egypt
.
We
can
not
think
*NL*
without
affright
of
those
lands
where
fakirs
,
bonzes
,
santons
,
Greek
*NL*
monks
,
marabouts
,
talapoins
,
and
dervishes
multiply
even
like
swarms
of
*NL*
vermin
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
said
,
the
religious
question
remains
.
This
question
has
certain
*NL*
mysterious
,
almost
formidable
sides
;
may
we
be
permitted
to
look
at
it
*NL*
fixedly
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
CONVENT
FROM
THE
POINT
OF
VIEW
OF
PRINCIPLES
*NL*
*NL*
Men
unite
themselves
and
dwell
in
communities
.
By
virtue
of
what
right
?
*NL*
By
virtue
of
the
right
of
association
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
shut
themselves
up
at
home
.
By
virtue
of
what
right
?
By
virtue
of
*NL*
the
right
which
every
man
has
to
open
or
shut
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
do
not
come
forth
.
By
virtue
of
what
right
?
By
virtue
of
the
right
*NL*
to
go
and
come
,
which
implies
the
right
to
remain
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
at
home
,
what
do
they
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
speak
in
low
tones
;
they
drop
their
eyes
;
they
toil
.
They
renounce
*NL*
the
world
,
towns
,
sensualities
,
pleasures
,
vanities
,
pride
,
interests
.
*NL*
They
are
clothed
in
coarse
woollen
or
coarse
linen
.
Not
one
of
them
*NL*
possesses
in
his
own
right
anything
whatever
.
On
entering
there
,
each
*NL*
one
who
was
rich
makes
himself
poor
.
What
he
has
,
he
gives
to
all
.
He
*NL*
who
was
what
is
called
noble
,
a
gentleman
and
a
lord
,
is
the
equal
of
*NL*
him
who
was
a
peasant
.
The
cell
is
identical
for
all
.
All
undergo
the
*NL*
same
tonsure
,
wear
the
same
frock
,
eat
the
same
black
bread
,
sleep
on
*NL*
the
same
straw
,
die
on
the
same
ashes
.
The
same
sack
on
their
backs
,
the
*NL*
same
rope
around
their
loins
.
If
the
decision
has
been
to
go
barefoot
,
*NL*
all
go
barefoot
.
There
may
be
a
prince
among
them
;
that
prince
is
the
*NL*
same
shadow
as
the
rest
.
No
titles
.
Even
family
names
have
disappeared
.
*NL*
They
bear
only
first
names
.
All
are
bowed
beneath
the
equality
of
*NL*
baptismal
names
.
They
have
dissolved
the
carnal
family
,
and
constituted
*NL*
in
their
community
a
spiritual
family
.
They
have
no
other
relatives
than
*NL*
all
men
.
They
succor
the
poor
,
they
care
for
the
sick
.
They
elect
those
*NL*
whom
they
obey
.
They
call
each
other
``
my
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
You
stop
me
and
exclaim
,
``
But
that
is
the
ideal
convent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
sufficient
that
it
may
be
the
possible
convent
,
that
I
should
take
*NL*
notice
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thence
it
results
that
,
in
the
preceding
book
,
I
have
spoken
of
a
*NL*
convent
with
respectful
accents
.
The
Middle
Ages
cast
aside
,
Asia
cast
*NL*
aside
,
the
historical
and
political
question
held
in
reserve
,
from
the
*NL*
purely
philosophical
point
of
view
,
outside
the
requirements
of
militant
*NL*
policy
,
on
condition
that
the
monastery
shall
be
absolutely
a
voluntary
*NL*
matter
and
shall
contain
only
consenting
parties
,
I
shall
always
*NL*
consider
a
cloistered
community
with
a
certain
attentive
,
and
,
in
some
*NL*
respects
,
a
deferential
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wherever
there
is
a
community
,
there
is
a
commune
;
where
there
is
a
*NL*
commune
,
there
is
right
.
The
monastery
is
the
product
of
the
formula
:
*NL*
Equality
,
Fraternity
.
Oh
!
how
grand
is
liberty
!
And
what
a
splendid
*NL*
transfiguration
!
Liberty
suffices
to
transform
the
monastery
into
a
*NL*
republic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
these
men
,
or
these
women
who
are
behind
these
four
walls
.
They
*NL*
dress
themselves
in
coarse
woollen
,
they
are
equals
,
they
call
each
*NL*
other
brothers
,
that
is
well
;
but
they
do
something
else
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
gaze
on
the
darkness
,
they
kneel
,
and
they
clasp
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
does
this
signify
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
V
--
PRAYER
*NL*
*NL*
They
pray
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
whom
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
pray
to
God
,
--
what
is
the
meaning
of
these
words
?
*NL*
*NL*
Is
there
an
infinite
beyond
us
?
Is
that
infinite
there
,
inherent
,
*NL*
permanent
;
necessarily
substantial
,
since
it
is
infinite
;
and
because
,
*NL*
if
it
lacked
matter
it
would
be
bounded
;
necessarily
intelligent
,
since
*NL*
it
is
infinite
,
and
because
,
if
it
lacked
intelligence
,
it
would
end
*NL*
there
?
Does
this
infinite
awaken
in
us
the
idea
of
essence
,
while
we
can
*NL*
attribute
to
ourselves
only
the
idea
of
existence
?
In
other
terms
,
is
it
*NL*
not
the
absolute
,
of
which
we
are
only
the
relative
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
that
there
is
an
infinite
without
us
,
is
there
not
*NL*
an
infinite
within
us
?
Are
not
these
two
infinites
-LRB-
what
an
alarming
*NL*
plural
!
-RRB-
superposed
,
the
one
upon
the
other
?
Is
not
this
second
*NL*
infinite
,
so
to
speak
,
subjacent
to
the
first
?
Is
it
not
the
latter
's
*NL*
mirror
,
reflection
,
echo
,
an
abyss
which
is
concentric
with
another
*NL*
abyss
?
Is
this
second
infinity
intelligent
also
?
Does
it
think
?
Does
*NL*
it
love
?
Does
it
will
?
If
these
two
infinities
are
intelligent
,
each
of
*NL*
them
has
a
will
principle
,
and
there
is
an
_
I
_
in
the
upper
infinity
as
*NL*
there
is
an
_
I
_
in
the
lower
infinity
.
The
_
I
_
below
is
the
soul
;
the
*NL*
_
I
_
on
high
is
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
place
the
infinity
here
below
in
contact
,
by
the
medium
of
thought
,
*NL*
with
the
infinity
on
high
,
is
called
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
take
nothing
from
the
human
mind
;
to
suppress
is
bad
.
We
must
*NL*
reform
and
transform
.
Certain
faculties
in
man
are
directed
towards
*NL*
the
Unknown
;
thought
,
revery
,
prayer
.
The
Unknown
is
an
ocean
.
What
*NL*
is
conscience
?
It
is
the
compass
of
the
Unknown
.
Thought
,
revery
,
*NL*
prayer
,
--
these
are
great
and
mysterious
radiations
.
Let
us
respect
them
.
*NL*
Whither
go
these
majestic
irradiations
of
the
soul
?
Into
the
shadow
;
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
to
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandeur
of
democracy
is
to
disown
nothing
and
to
deny
nothing
of
*NL*
humanity
.
Close
to
the
right
of
the
man
,
beside
it
,
at
the
least
,
there
*NL*
exists
the
right
of
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
crush
fanaticism
and
to
venerate
the
infinite
,
such
is
the
law
.
Let
*NL*
us
not
confine
ourselves
to
prostrating
ourselves
before
the
tree
of
*NL*
creation
,
and
to
the
contemplation
of
its
branches
full
of
stars
.
We
*NL*
have
a
duty
to
labor
over
the
human
soul
,
to
defend
the
mystery
against
*NL*
the
miracle
,
to
adore
the
incomprehensible
and
reject
the
absurd
,
*NL*
to
admit
,
as
an
inexplicable
fact
,
only
what
is
necessary
,
to
purify
*NL*
belief
,
to
remove
superstitions
from
above
religion
;
to
clear
God
of
*NL*
caterpillars
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
ABSOLUTE
GOODNESS
OF
PRAYER
*NL*
*NL*
With
regard
to
the
modes
of
prayer
,
all
are
good
,
provided
that
they
are
*NL*
sincere
.
Turn
your
book
upside
down
and
be
in
the
infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
,
as
we
know
,
a
philosophy
which
denies
the
infinite
.
There
is
*NL*
also
a
philosophy
,
pathologically
classified
,
which
denies
the
sun
;
this
*NL*
philosophy
is
called
blindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
erect
a
sense
which
we
lack
into
a
source
of
truth
,
is
a
fine
blind
*NL*
man
's
self-sufficiency
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curious
thing
is
the
haughty
,
superior
,
and
compassionate
airs
which
*NL*
this
groping
philosophy
assumes
towards
the
philosophy
which
beholds
*NL*
God
.
One
fancies
he
hears
a
mole
crying
,
``
I
pity
them
with
their
sun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
,
as
we
know
,
powerful
and
illustrious
atheists
.
At
bottom
,
led
*NL*
back
to
the
truth
by
their
very
force
,
they
are
not
absolutely
sure
that
*NL*
they
are
atheists
;
it
is
with
them
only
a
question
of
definition
,
and
in
*NL*
any
case
,
if
they
do
not
believe
in
God
,
being
great
minds
,
they
prove
*NL*
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
salute
them
as
philosophers
,
while
inexorably
denouncing
their
*NL*
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
remarkable
thing
about
it
is
,
also
,
their
facility
in
paying
*NL*
themselves
off
with
words
.
A
metaphysical
school
of
the
North
,
*NL*
impregnated
to
some
extent
with
fog
,
has
fancied
that
it
has
worked
a
*NL*
revolution
in
human
understanding
by
replacing
the
word
Force
with
the
*NL*
word
Will
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
say
:
``
the
plant
wills
,
''
instead
of
:
``
the
plant
grows
''
:
this
would
be
*NL*
fecund
in
results
,
indeed
,
if
we
were
to
add
:
``
the
universe
wills
.
''
Why
?
*NL*
Because
it
would
come
to
this
:
the
plant
wills
,
therefore
it
has
an
_
I
_
;
*NL*
the
universe
wills
,
therefore
it
has
a
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
us
,
who
,
however
,
in
contradistinction
to
this
school
,
reject
*NL*
nothing
a
priori
,
a
will
in
the
plant
,
accepted
by
this
school
,
appears
*NL*
to
us
more
difficult
to
admit
than
a
will
in
the
universe
denied
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
deny
the
will
of
the
infinite
,
that
is
to
say
,
God
,
is
impossible
on
*NL*
any
other
conditions
than
a
denial
of
the
infinite
.
We
have
demonstrated
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
negation
of
the
infinite
leads
straight
to
nihilism
.
Everything
*NL*
becomes
``
a
mental
conception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
nihilism
,
no
discussion
is
possible
;
for
the
nihilist
logic
doubts
*NL*
the
existence
of
its
interlocutor
,
and
is
not
quite
sure
that
it
exists
*NL*
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
its
point
of
view
,
it
is
possible
that
it
may
be
for
itself
,
only
*NL*
``
a
mental
conception
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
it
does
not
perceive
that
all
which
it
has
denied
it
admits
in
the
*NL*
lump
,
simply
by
the
utterance
of
the
word
,
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
no
way
is
open
to
the
thought
by
a
philosophy
which
makes
all
*NL*
end
in
the
monosyllable
,
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
No
there
is
only
one
reply
,
Yes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nihilism
has
no
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
such
thing
as
nothingness
.
Zero
does
not
exist
.
Everything
*NL*
is
something
.
Nothing
is
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
lives
by
affirmation
even
more
than
by
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
to
see
and
to
show
does
not
suffice
.
Philosophy
should
be
an
*NL*
energy
;
it
should
have
for
effort
and
effect
to
ameliorate
the
condition
*NL*
of
man
.
Socrates
should
enter
into
Adam
and
produce
Marcus
Aurelius
;
in
*NL*
other
words
,
the
man
of
wisdom
should
be
made
to
emerge
from
the
man
*NL*
of
felicity
.
Eden
should
be
changed
into
a
Lyceum
.
Science
should
be
*NL*
a
cordial
.
To
enjoy
,
--
what
a
sad
aim
,
and
what
a
paltry
ambition
!
The
*NL*
brute
enjoys
.
To
offer
thought
to
the
thirst
of
men
,
to
give
them
all
as
*NL*
an
elixir
the
notion
of
God
,
to
make
conscience
and
science
fraternize
*NL*
in
them
,
to
render
them
just
by
this
mysterious
confrontation
;
such
is
*NL*
the
function
of
real
philosophy
.
Morality
is
a
blossoming
out
of
truths
.
*NL*
Contemplation
leads
to
action
.
The
absolute
should
be
practicable
.
It
is
*NL*
necessary
that
the
ideal
should
be
breathable
,
drinkable
,
and
eatable
to
*NL*
the
human
mind
.
It
is
the
ideal
which
has
the
right
to
say
:
Take
,
this
!
*NL*
It
is
on
this
condition
that
it
ceases
to
be
a
sterile
love
of
science
*NL*
and
becomes
the
one
and
sovereign
mode
of
human
rallying
,
and
that
*NL*
philosophy
herself
is
promoted
to
religion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Philosophy
should
not
be
a
corbel
erected
on
mystery
to
gaze
upon
it
*NL*
at
its
ease
,
without
any
other
result
than
that
of
being
convenient
to
*NL*
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
our
part
,
adjourning
the
development
of
our
thought

another

we
will
confine
ourselves
to
saying

we
neither

man
as
a

of
departure
nor
progress
as
an
end
,
without
those
two
*NL*
forces
which
are
their
two
motors
:
faith
and
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Progress
is
the
goal

the
ideal

What

PRECAUTIONS
TO
BE
OBSERVED
IN
BLAME
*NL*
*NL*
History
and
philosophy
have
eternal
duties
,
which
are
,
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
simple
duties
;
to
combat
Caiphas
the
High-priest
,
Draco
the
Lawgiver
,
*NL*
Trimalcion
the
Legislator
,
Tiberius
the
Emperor
;
this
is
clear
,
direct
,
*NL*
and
limpid
,
and
offers
no
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
right
to
live
apart
,
even
with
its
inconveniences
and
its
*NL*
abuses
,
insists
on
being
stated
and
taken
into
account
.
Cenobitism
is
a
*NL*
human
problem
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
speaks
of
convents
,
those
abodes
of
error
,
but
of
innocence
,
*NL*
of
aberration
but
of
good-will
,
of
ignorance
but
of
devotion
,
of
torture
*NL*
but
of
martyrdom
,
it
always
becomes
necessary
to
say
either
yes
or
no
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
convent
is
a
contradiction
.
Its
object
,
salvation
;
its
means
thereto
,
*NL*
sacrifice
.
The
convent
is
supreme
egoism
having
for
its
result
supreme
*NL*
abnegation
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
abdicate
with
the
object
of
reigning
seems
to
be
the
device
of
*NL*
monasticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
cloister
,
one
suffers
in
order
to
enjoy
.
One
draws
a
bill
of
*NL*
exchange
on
death
.
One
discounts
in
terrestrial
gloom
celestial
light
.
*NL*
In
the
cloister
,
hell
is
accepted
in
advance
as
a
post
obit
on
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
taking
of
the
veil
or
the
frock
is
a
suicide
paid
for
with
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
does
not
seem
to
us
,
that
on
such
a
subject
mockery
is
permissible
.
*NL*
All
about
it
is
serious
,
the
good
as
well
as
the
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
just
man
frowns
,
but
never
smiles
with
a
malicious
sneer
.
We
*NL*
understand
wrath
,
but
not
malice
.

*NL*
A
few
words
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
blame
the
church
when
she
is
saturated
with
intrigues
,
we
despise
the
*NL*
spiritual
which
is
harsh
toward
the
temporal
;
but
we
everywhere
honor
*NL*
the
thoughtful
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
salute
the
man
who
kneels
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
faith
;
this
is
a
necessity
for
man
.
Woe
to
him
who
believes
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
is
not
unoccupied
because
one
is
absorbed
.
There
is
visible
labor
*NL*
and
invisible
labor
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
contemplate
is
to
labor
,
to
think
is
to
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
Folded
arms
toil
,
clasped
hands
work
.
A
gaze
fixed
on
heaven
is
a
work
.
*NL*

Thales
remained
motionless
for
four
years
.
He
founded
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
opinion
,
cenobites
are
not
lazy
men
,
and
recluses
are
not
idlers
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
meditate
on
the
Shadow
is
a
serious
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
invalidating
anything
that
we
have
just
said
,
we
believe
that
*NL*
a
perpetual
memory
of
the
tomb
is
proper
for
the
living
.
On
this
point
,
*NL*
the
priest
and
the
philosopher
agree
.
We
must
die
.
The
Abbe
de
la
Trappe
*NL*
replies
to
Horace
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
mingle
with
one
's
life
a
certain
presence
of
the
sepulchre
,
--
this
is
*NL*
the
law
of
the
sage
;
and
it
is
the
law
of
the
ascetic
.
In
this
respect
,
*NL*
the
ascetic
and
the
sage
converge
.
There
is
a
material
growth
;
we
*NL*
admit
it
.
There
is
a
moral
grandeur
;
we
hold
to
that
.
Thoughtless
and
*NL*
vivacious
spirits
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
good
of
those
motionless
figures
on
the
side
of
mystery
?
*NL*
What
purpose
do
they
serve
?
What
do
they
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
In
the
presence
of
the
darkness
which
environs
us
,
and
which
*NL*
awaits
us
,
in
our
ignorance
of
what
the
immense
dispersion
will
make
of
*NL*
us
,
we
reply
:
``
There
is
probably
no
work
more
divine
than
that
performed
*NL*
by
these
souls
.
''
And
we
add
:
``
There
is
probably
no
work
which
is
more
*NL*
useful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
certainly
must
be
some
who
pray
constantly
for
those
who
never
*NL*
pray
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
our
opinion
the
whole
question
lies
in
the
amount
of
thought
that
is
*NL*
mingled
with
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leibnitz
praying
is
grand
,
Voltaire
adoring
is
fine
.
Deo
erexit
*NL*
Voltaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
for
religion
as
against
religions
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
of
the
number
who
believe
in
the
wretchedness
of
orisons
,
and
the
*NL*
sublimity
of
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
at
this
minute
which
we
are
now
traversing
,
--
a
minute
which
*NL*
will
not
,
fortunately
,
leave
its
impress
on
the
nineteenth
century
,
--
at
*NL*
this
hour
,
when
so
many
men
have
low
brows
and
souls
but
little
*NL*
elevated
,
among
so
many
mortals
whose
morality
consists
in
enjoyment
,
*NL*
and
who
are
busied
with
the
brief
and
misshapen
things
of
matter
,
*NL*
whoever
exiles
himself
seems
worthy
of
veneration
to
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
monastery
is
a
renunciation
.
Sacrifice
wrongly
directed
is
still
*NL*
sacrifice
.
To
mistake
a
grave
error
for
a
duty
has
a
grandeur
of
its
*NL*
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taken
by
itself
,
and
ideally
,
and
in
order
to
examine
the
truth
on
all
*NL*
sides
until
all
aspects
have
been
impartially
exhausted
,
the
monastery
,
*NL*
the
female
convent
in
particular
,
--
for
in
our
century
it
is
woman
who
*NL*
suffers
the
most
,
and
in
this
exile
of
the
cloister
there
is
something
*NL*
of
protestation
,
--
the
female
convent
has
incontestably
a
certain
*NL*
majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cloistered
existence
which
is
so
austere
,
so
depressing
,
a
few
of
*NL*
whose
features
we
have
just
traced
,
is
not
life
,
for
it
is
not
liberty
;
*NL*
it
is
not
the
tomb
,
for
it
is
not
plenitude
;
it
is
the
strange
place
*NL*
whence
one
beholds
,
as
from
the
crest
of
a
lofty
mountain
,
on
one
side
*NL*
the
abyss
where
we
are
,
on
the
other
,
the
abyss
whither
we
shall
go
;
it
*NL*
is
the
narrow
and
misty
frontier
separating
two
worlds
,
illuminated
*NL*
and
obscured
by
both
at
the
same
time
,
where
the
ray
of
life
which
has
*NL*
become
enfeebled
is
mingled
with
the
vague
ray
of
death
;
it
is
the
half
*NL*
obscurity
of
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
,
who
do
not
believe
what
these
women
believe
,
but
who
,
like
them
,
*NL*
live
by
faith
,
--
we
have
never
been
able
to
think
without
a
sort
of
*NL*
tender
and
religious
terror
,
without
a
sort
of
pity
,
that
is
full
of
*NL*
envy
,
of
those
devoted
,
trembling
and
trusting
creatures
,
of
these
*NL*
humble
and
august
souls
,
who
dare
to
dwell
on
the
very
brink
of
the
*NL*
mystery
,
waiting
between
the
world
which
is
closed
and
heaven
which
is
*NL*
not
yet
open
,
turned
towards
the
light
which
one
can
not
see
,
possessing
*NL*
the
sole
happiness
of
thinking
that
they
know
where
it
is
,
aspiring
*NL*
towards
the
gulf
,
and
the
unknown
,
their
eyes
fixed
motionless
on
the
*NL*
darkness
,
kneeling

bewildered
,
stupefied

shuddering

half

CHAPTER
I
--
WHICH
TREATS
OF
THE
MANNER
OF
ENTERING
A
CONVENT
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
into
this
house
that
Jean
Valjean
had
,
as
Fauchelevent
expressed
*NL*
it
,
``
fallen
from
the
sky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
scaled
the
wall
of
the
garden
which
formed
the
angle
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Polonceau
.
That
hymn
of
the
angels
which
he
had
heard
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
night
,
was
the
nuns
chanting
matins
;
that
hall
,
of
which
he
had
*NL*
caught
a
glimpse
in
the
gloom
,
was
the
chapel
.
That
phantom
which
he
had
*NL*
seen
stretched
on
the
ground
was
the
sister
who
was
making
reparation
;
*NL*
that
bell
,
the
sound
of
which
had
so
strangely
surprised
him
,
was
the
*NL*
gardener
's
bell
attached
to
the
knee
of
Father
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
once
put
to
bed
,
Jean
Valjean
and
Fauchelevent
had
,
as
we
have
*NL*
already
seen
,
supped
on
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
bit
of
cheese
before
a
*NL*
good
,
crackling
fire
;
then
,
the
only
bed
in
the
hut
being
occupied
by
*NL*
Cosette
,
each
threw
himself
on
a
truss
of
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
shut
his
eyes
,
Jean
Valjean
said
:
``
I
must
remain
here
*NL*
henceforth
.
''
This
remark
trotted
through
Fauchelevent
's
head
all
night
*NL*
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
tell
the
truth
,
neither
of
them
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
feeling
that
he
was
discovered
and
that
Javert
was
on
*NL*
his
scent
,
understood
that
he
and
Cosette
were
lost
if
they
returned
to
*NL*
Paris
.
Then
the
new
storm
which
had
just
burst
upon
him
had
stranded
*NL*
him
in
this
cloister
.
Jean
Valjean
had
,
henceforth
,
but
one
thought
,
--
to
*NL*
remain
there
.
Now
,
for
an
unfortunate
man
in
his
position
,
this
*NL*
convent
was
both
the
safest
and
the
most
dangerous
of
places
;
the
most
*NL*
dangerous
,
because
,
as
no
men
might
enter
there
,
if
he
were
discovered
,
*NL*
it
was
a
flagrant
offence
,
and
Jean
Valjean
would
find
but
one
step
*NL*
intervening
between
the
convent
and
prison
;
the
safest
,
because
,
if
he
*NL*
could
manage
to
get
himself
accepted
there
and
remain
there
,
who
would
*NL*
ever
seek
him
in
such
a
place
?
To
dwell
in
an
impossible
place
was
*NL*
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
side
,
Fauchelevent
was
cudgelling
his
brains
.
He
began
by
*NL*
declaring
to
himself
that
he
understood
nothing
of
the
matter
.
How
had
*NL*
M.
Madeleine
got
there
,
when
the
walls
were
what
they
were
?
Cloister
*NL*
walls
are
not
to
be
stepped
over
.
How
did
he
get
there
with
a
child
?
One
*NL*
can
not
scale
a
perpendicular
wall
with
a
child
in
one
's
arms
.
Who
was
*NL*
that
child
?
Where
did
they
both
come
from
?
Since
Fauchelevent
had
lived
*NL*
in
the
convent
,
he
had
heard
nothing
of
M.
sur
M.
,
and
he
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
what
had
taken
place
there
.
Father
Madeleine
had
an
air
which
*NL*
discouraged
questions
;
and
besides
,
Fauchelevent
said
to
himself
:
``
One
*NL*
does
not
question
a
saint
.
''
M.
Madeleine
had
preserved
all
his
prestige
*NL*
in
Fauchelevent
's
eyes
.
Only
,
from
some
words
which
Jean
Valjean
had
let
*NL*
fall
,
the
gardener
thought
he
could
draw
the
inference
that
M.
Madeleine
*NL*
had
probably
become
bankrupt
through
the
hard
times
,
and
that
he
was
*NL*
pursued
by
his
creditors
;
or
that
he
had
compromised
himself
in
some
*NL*
political
affair
,
and
was
in
hiding
;
which
last
did
not
displease
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
who
,
like
many
of
our
peasants
of
the
North
,
had
an
*NL*
old
fund
of
Bonapartism
about
him
.
While
in
hiding
,
M.
Madeleine
had
*NL*
selected
the
convent
as
a
refuge
,
and
it
was
quite
simple
that
he
should
*NL*
wish
to
remain
there
.
But
the
inexplicable
point
,
to
which
Fauchelevent
*NL*
returned
constantly
and
over
which
he
wearied
his
brain
,
was
that
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
should
be
there
,
and
that
he
should
have
that
little
girl
with
*NL*
him
.
Fauchelevent
saw
them
,
touched
them
,
spoke
to
them
,
and
still
did
*NL*
not
believe
it
possible
.
The
incomprehensible
had
just
made
its
entrance
*NL*
into
Fauchelevent
's
hut
.
Fauchelevent
groped
about
amid
conjectures
,
and
*NL*
could
see
nothing
clearly
but
this
:
``
M.
Madeleine
saved
my
life
.
''
*NL*
This
certainty
alone
was
sufficient
and
decided
his
course
.
He
said
to
*NL*
himself
:
``
It
is
my
turn
now
.
''
He
added
in
his
conscience
:
``
M.
Madeleine
*NL*
did
not
stop
to
deliberate
when
it
was
a
question
of
thrusting
himself
*NL*
under
the
cart
for
the
purpose
of
dragging
me
out
.
''
He
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
save
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
put
many
questions
to
himself
and
made
himself
divers
*NL*
replies
:
``
After
what
he
did
for
me
,
would
I
save
him
if
he
were
a
thief
?
*NL*
Just
the
same
.
If
he
were
an
assassin
,
would
I
save
him
?
Just
the
same
.
*NL*
Since
he
is
a
saint
,
shall
I
save
him
?
Just
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
a
problem
it
was
to
manage
to
have
him
remain
in
the
convent
!
*NL*
Fauchelevent
did
not
recoil
in
the
face
of
this
almost
chimerical
*NL*
undertaking
;
this
poor
peasant
of
Picardy
without
any
other
ladder
*NL*
than
his
self-devotion
,
his
good
will
,
and
a
little
of
that
old
*NL*
rustic
cunning
,
on
this
occasion
enlisted
in
the
service
of
a
generous
*NL*
enterprise
,
undertook
to
scale
the
difficulties
of
the
cloister
,
and
the
*NL*
steep
escarpments
of
the
rule
of
Saint-Benoit
.
Father
Fauchelevent
was
*NL*
an
old
man
who
had
been
an
egoist
all
his
life
,
and
who
,
towards
the
end
*NL*
of
his
days
,
halt
,
infirm
,
with
no
interest
left
to
him
in
the
world
,
*NL*
found
it
sweet
to
be
grateful
,
and
perceiving
a
generous
action
to
be
*NL*
performed
,
flung
himself
upon
it
like
a
man
,
who
at
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
is
dying
,
should
find
close
to
his
hand
a
glass
of
good
wine
which
he
*NL*
had
never
tasted
,
and
should
swallow
it
with
avidity
.
We
may
add
,
*NL*
that
the
air
which
he
had
breathed
for
many
years
in
this
convent
had
*NL*
destroyed
all
personality
in
him
,
and
had
ended
by
rendering
a
good
*NL*
action
of
some
kind
absolutely
necessary
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
he
took
his
resolve
:
to
devote
himself
to
M.
Madeleine
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
just
called
him
a
poor
peasant
of
Picardy
.
That
description
*NL*
is
just
,
but
incomplete
.
At
the
point
of
this
story
which
we
have
now
*NL*
reached
,
a
little
of
Father
Fauchelevent
's
physiology
becomes
useful
.
*NL*
He
was
a
peasant
,
but
he
had
been
a
notary
,
which
added
trickery
to
his
*NL*
cunning
,
and
penetration
to
his
ingenuousness
.
Having
,
through
various
*NL*
causes
,
failed
in
his
business
,
he
had
descended
to
the
calling
of
a
*NL*
carter
and
a
laborer
.
But
,
in
spite
of
oaths
and
lashings
,
which
horses
*NL*
seem
to
require
,
something
of
the
notary
had
lingered
in
him
.
He
had
*NL*
some
natural
wit
;
he
talked
good
grammar
;
he
conversed
,
which
is
a
rare
*NL*
thing
in
a
village
;
and
the
other
peasants
said
of
him
:
``
He
talks
almost
*NL*
like
a
gentleman
with
a
hat
.
''
Fauchelevent
belonged
,
in
fact
,
to
that
*NL*
species
,
which
the
impertinent
and
flippant
vocabulary
of
the
last
*NL*
century
qualified
as
demi-bourgeois
,
demi-lout
,
and
which
the
metaphors
*NL*
showered
by
the
chateau
upon
the
thatched
cottage
ticketed
in
the
*NL*
pigeon-hole
of
the
plebeian
:
rather
rustic
,
rather
citified
;
pepper
and
*NL*
salt
.
Fauchelevent
,
though
sorely
tried
and
harshly
used
by
fate
,
*NL*
worn
out
,
a
sort
of
poor
,
threadbare
old
soul
,
was
,
nevertheless
,
an
*NL*
impulsive
man
,
and
extremely
spontaneous
in
his
actions
;
a
precious
*NL*
quality
which
prevents
one
from
ever
being
wicked
.
His
defects
and
his
*NL*
vices
,
for
he
had
some
,
were
all
superficial
;
in
short
,
his
physiognomy
*NL*
was
of
the
kind
which
succeeds
with
an
observer
.
His
aged
face
had
none
*NL*
of
those
disagreeable
wrinkles
at
the
top
of
the
forehead
,
which
signify
*NL*
malice
or
stupidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
,
Father
Fauchelevent
opened
his
eyes
,
after
having
done
an
*NL*
enormous
deal
of
thinking
,
and
beheld
M.
Madeleine
seated
on
his
truss
*NL*
of
straw
,
and
watching
Cosette
's
slumbers
.
Fauchelevent
sat
up
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
you
are
here
,
how
are
you
going
to
contrive
to
enter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
summed
up
the
situation
and
aroused
Jean
Valjean
from
his
*NL*
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
took
counsel
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
,
``
you
will
begin
by
not
setting
*NL*
foot
outside
of
this
chamber
,
either
you
or
the
child
.
One
step
in
the
*NL*
garden
and
we
are
done
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Madeleine
,
''
resumed
Fauchelevent
,
``
you
have
arrived
at
a
very
*NL*
auspicious
moment
,
I
mean
to
say
a
very
inauspicious
moment
;
one
of
*NL*
the
ladies
is
very
ill
.
This
will
prevent
them
from
looking
much
in
our
*NL*
direction
.
It
seems
that
she
is
dying
.
The
prayers
of
the
forty
hours
*NL*
are
being
said
.
The
whole
community
is
in
confusion
.
That
occupies
them
.
*NL*
The
one
who
is
on
the
point
of
departure
is
a
saint
.
In
fact
,
we
are
*NL*
all
saints
here
;
all
the
difference
between
them
and
me
is
that
they
say
*NL*
`
our
cell
,
'
and
that
I
say
`
my
cabin
.
'
The
prayers
for
the
dying
are
to
*NL*
be
said
,
and
then
the
prayers
for
the
dead
.
We
shall
be
at
peace
here
*NL*
for
to-day
;
but
I
will
not
answer
for
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
''
observed
Jean
Valjean
,
``
this
cottage
is
in
the
niche
of
the
*NL*
wall
,
it
is
hidden
by
a
sort
of
ruin
,
there
are
trees
,
it
is
not
visible
*NL*
from
the
convent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
add
that
the
nuns
never
come
near
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interrogation
mark
which
accentuated
this
``
well
''
signified
:
*NL*
``
it
seems
to
me
that
one
may
remain
concealed
here
?
''
It
was
to
this
*NL*
interrogation
point
that
Fauchelevent
responded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
the
little
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
little
girls
?
''
asked
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Fauchelevent
opened
his
mouth
to
explain
the
words
which
he
had
*NL*
uttered
,
a
bell
emitted
one
stroke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nun
is
dead
,
''
said
he
.
``
There
is
the
knell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
made
a
sign
to
Jean
Valjean
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bell
struck
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
knell
,
Monsieur
Madeleine
.
The
bell
will
continue
to
strike
*NL*
once
a
minute
for
twenty-four
hours
,
until
the
body
is
taken
from
the
*NL*
church
.
--
You
see
,
they
play
.
At
recreation
hours
it
suffices
to
have
a
*NL*
ball
roll
aside
,
to
send
them
all
hither
,
in
spite
of
prohibitions
,
to
*NL*
hunt
and
rummage
for
it
all
about
here
.
Those
cherubs
are
devils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
asked
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
little
girls
.
You
would
be
very
quickly
discovered
.
They
would
*NL*
shriek
:
`
Oh
!
a
man
!
'
There
is
no
danger
to-day
.
There
will
be
no
*NL*
recreation
hour
.
The
day
will
be
entirely
devoted
to
prayers
.
You
hear
*NL*
the
bell
.
As
I
told
you
,
a
stroke
each
minute
.
It
is
the
death
knell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
Father
Fauchelevent
.
There
are
pupils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jean
Valjean
thought
to
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
Cosette
's
education
already
provided
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardine
!
There
are
little
girls
indeed
!
And
they
would
bawl
around
you
!
*NL*
And
they
would
rush
off
!
To
be
a
man
here
is
to
have
the
plague
.
You
see
*NL*
how
they
fasten
a
bell
to
my
paw
as
though
I
were
a
wild
beast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
fell
into
more
and
more
profound
thought
.
--
``
This
convent
*NL*
would
be
our
salvation
,
''
he
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
raised
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
difficulty
is
to
remain
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
,
``
the
difficulty
is
to
get
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
felt
the
blood
rush
back
to
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
get
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Monsieur
Madeleine
.
In
order
to
return
here
it
is
first
necessary
*NL*
to
get
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
waiting
until
another
stroke
of
the
knell
had
sounded
,
*NL*
Fauchelevent
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
be
found
here
in
this
fashion
.
Whence
come
you
?
For
me
,
*NL*
you
fall
from
heaven
,
because
I
know
you
;
but
the
nuns
require
one
to
*NL*
enter
by
the
door
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
they
heard
a
rather
complicated
pealing
from
another
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Fauchelevent
,
``
they
are
ringing
up
the
vocal
mothers
.
They
*NL*
are
going
to
the
chapter
.
They
always
hold
a
chapter
when
any
one
dies
.
*NL*
She
died
at
daybreak
.
People
generally
do
die
at
daybreak
.
But
can
not
*NL*
you
get
out
by
the
way
in
which
you
entered
?
Come
,
I
do
not
ask
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
questioning
you
,
but
how
did
you
get
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
pale
;
the
very
thought
of
descending
again
into
*NL*
that
terrible
street
made
him
shudder
.
You
make
your
way
out
of
a
forest
*NL*
filled
with
tigers
,
and
once
out
of
it
,
imagine
a
friendly
counsel
that
*NL*
shall
advise
you
to
return
thither
!
Jean
Valjean
pictured
to
himself
the
*NL*
whole
police
force
still
engaged
in
swarming
in
that
quarter
,
agents
on
*NL*
the
watch
,
sentinels
everywhere
,
frightful
fists
extended
towards
his
*NL*
collar
,
Javert
at
the
corner
of
the
intersection
of
the
streets
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
!
''
said
he
.
``
Father
Fauchelevent
,
say
that
I
fell
from
the
*NL*
sky
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
believe
it
,
I
believe
it
,
''
retorted
Fauchelevent
.
``
You
have
no
*NL*
need
to
tell
me
that
.
The
good
God
must
have
taken
you
in
his
hand
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
getting
a
good
look
at
you
close
to
,
and
then
dropped
*NL*
you
.
Only
,
he
meant
to
place
you
in
a
man
's
convent
;
he
made
a
mistake
.
*NL*
Come
,
there
goes
another
peal
,
that
is
to
order
the
porter
to
go
and
*NL*
inform
the
municipality
that
the
dead-doctor
is
to
come
here
and
view
a
*NL*
corpse
.
All
that
is
the
ceremony
of
dying
.
These
good
ladies
are
not
*NL*
at
all
fond
of
that
visit
.
A
doctor
is
a
man
who
does
not
believe
in
*NL*
anything
.
He
lifts
the
veil
.
Sometimes
he
lifts
something
else
too
.
How
*NL*
quickly
they
have
had
the
doctor
summoned
this
time
!
What
is
the
matter
?
*NL*
Your
little
one
is
still
asleep
.
What
is
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
your
daughter

You
are
her
grandfather

that
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
easy
enough
for
her
to
get
out
of
here
.
I
have
my
service
*NL*
door
which
opens
on
the
courtyard
.
I
knock
.
The
porter
opens
;
I
have
*NL*
my
vintage
basket
on
my
back
,
the
child
is
in
it
,
I
go
out
.
Father
*NL*
Fauchelevent
goes
out
with
his
basket
--
that
is
perfectly
natural
.
You
*NL*
will
tell
the
child
to
keep
very
quiet
.
She
will
be
under
the
cover

I
*NL*
will
leave
her
for
whatever
time
is
required

a
good
old
friend

a

fruit-seller
whom
I
know
in
the
Rue
Chemin-Vert
,
who
is
deaf
,
and
who
*NL*
has
a
little
bed

I
will
shout
in
the
fruit-seller
's
ear

that
she
is
a
*NL*
niece
of
mine

that
she
is
to
keep
her
for
me
until
to-morrow

Then
*NL*
the
little
one
will
re-enter
with
you

for
I
will
contrive
to
have
you
*NL*
re-enter
.
It
must
be
done
.
But
how
will
you
manage
to
get
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
must
see
me
,
the
whole
point
lies
there
,
Father
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
Find
some
means
of
getting
me
out
in
a
basket
,
under
cover

like
*NL*
Cosette

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
scratched
the
lobe
of
his
ear
with
the
middle
finger
of
his
*NL*
left
hand
,
a
sign
of
serious
embarrassment
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
peal
created
a
diversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
dead-doctor
taking
his
departure
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
.
``
He
*NL*
has
taken
a
look
and
said
:
`
She
is
dead
,
that
is
well
.
'
When
the
doctor
*NL*
has
signed
the
passport
for
paradise
,
the
undertaker
's
company
sends
a
*NL*
coffin
.
If
it
is
a
mother
,
the
mothers
lay
her
out
;
if
she
is
a
sister
,
*NL*
the
sisters
lay
her
out
.
After
which
,
I
nail
her
up
.
That
forms
a
part
*NL*
of
my
gardener
's
duty
.
A
gardener
is
a
bit
of
a
grave-digger
.
She
is
*NL*
placed
in
a
lower
hall
of
the
church
which
communicates
with
the
street
,
*NL*
and
into
which
no
man
may
enter
save
the
doctor
of
the
dead

I
do
n't
*NL*
count
the
undertaker
's
men
and
myself
as
men
.
It
is
in
that
hall
that
I
*NL*
nail
up
the
coffin
.
The
undertaker
's
men
come
and
get
it
,
and
whip
*NL*
up
,
coachman
!
that
's
the
way
one
goes
to
heaven
.
They
fetch
a
box
with
*NL*
nothing
in
it
,
they
take
it
away
again
with
something
in
it

That
's
what
*NL*
a
burial
is
like
.
De
profundis

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
horizontal
ray
of
sunshine
lightly
touched
the
face
of
the
sleeping
*NL*
Cosette
,
who
lay
with
her
mouth
vaguely
open
,
and
had
the
air
of
an
*NL*
angel
drinking
in
the
light
.
Jean
Valjean
had
fallen
to
gazing
at
her
.
*NL*
He
was
no
longer
listening
to
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
one
is
not
listened
to
is
no
reason
for
preserving
silence
.
The
*NL*
good
old
gardener
went
on
tranquilly
with
his
babble
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
grave
is
dug
in
the
Vaugirard
cemetery
.
They
declare
that
they
are
*NL*
going
to
suppress
that
Vaugirard
cemetery
.
It
is
an
ancient
cemetery
*NL*
which
is
outside
the
regulations
,
which
has
no
uniform
,
and
which
is
*NL*
going
to
retire

It
is
a
shame

for
it
is
convenient

I
have
a
friend

there

Father
Mestienne

the
grave-digger

The
nuns
here
possess
one
*NL*
privilege

it
is
to
be
taken
to
that
cemetery
at
nightfall

There
is
*NL*
a
special
permission
from
the
Prefecture
on
their
behalf
.
But
how
many
*NL*
events
have
happened
since
yesterday
!
Mother
Crucifixion
is
dead
,
and
*NL*
Father
Madeleine
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
buried
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
smiling
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
caught
the
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
!
if
you
were
here
for
good
,
it
would
be
a
real
burial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fourth
peal
burst
out
.
Fauchelevent
hastily
detached
the
belled
*NL*
knee-cap
from
its
nail
and
buckled
it
on
his
knee
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
time
it
is
for
me
.
The
Mother
Prioress
wants
me
.
Good
,
now
I
am
*NL*
pricking
myself
on
the
tongue
of
my
buckle
.
Monsieur
Madeleine
,
do
n't
*NL*
stir
from
here
,
and
wait
for
me
.
Something
new
has
come
up
.
If
you
are
*NL*
hungry
,
there
is
wine
,
bread
and
cheese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
hastened
out
of
the
hut
,
crying
:
``
Coming
!
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
watched
him
hurrying
across
the
garden
as
fast
as
his
*NL*
crooked
leg
would
permit
,
casting
a
sidelong
glance
by
the
way
on
his
*NL*
melon
patch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Less
than
ten
minutes
later
,
Father
Fauchelevent
,
whose
bell
put
the
*NL*
nuns
in
his
road
to
flight
,
tapped
gently
at
a
door
,
and
a
gentle
voice
*NL*
replied
:
``
Forever
!
Forever
!
''
that
is
to
say
:
``
Enter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
the
one
leading
to
the
parlor
reserved
for
seeing
the
*NL*
gardener
on
business
.
This
parlor
adjoined
the
chapter
hall
.
The
*NL*
prioress
,
seated
on
the
only
chair
in
the
parlor
,
was
waiting
for
*NL*
Fauchelevent
.

CHAPTER
II
--
FAUCHELEVENT
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
A
DIFFICULTY
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
peculiarity
of
certain
persons
and
certain
professions
,
*NL*
notably
priests
and
nuns
,
to
wear
a
grave
and
agitated
air
on
critical
*NL*
occasions
.
At
the
moment
when
Fauchelevent
entered
,
this
double
form
of
*NL*
preoccupation
was
imprinted
on
the
countenance
of
the
prioress
,
who
was
*NL*
that
wise
and
charming
Mademoiselle
de
Blemeur
,
Mother
Innocente
,
who
*NL*
was
ordinarily
cheerful
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gardener
made
a
timid
bow
,
and
remained
at
the
door
of
the
cell
.
The
*NL*
prioress
,
who
was
telling
her
beads
,
raised
her
eyes
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
is
you
,
Father
Fauvent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
abbreviation
had
been
adopted
in
the
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
bowed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauvent
,
I
have
sent
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
reverend
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
have
I
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
with
a
boldness
which
caused
him
*NL*
inward
terror
,
``
I
have
something
to
say
to
the
very
reverend
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
stared
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
have
a
communication
to
make
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
request
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Goodman
Fauchelevent
,
the
ex-notary
,
belonged
to
the
category
of
*NL*
peasants
who
have
assurance
.
A
certain
clever
ignorance
constitutes
a
*NL*
force
;
you
do
not
distrust
it
,
and
you
are
caught
by
it
.
Fauchelevent
*NL*
had
been
a
success
during
the
something
more
than
two
years
which
he
had
*NL*
passed
in
the
convent
.
Always
solitary
and
busied
about
his
gardening
,
*NL*
he
had
nothing
else
to
do
than
to
indulge
his
curiosity
.
As
he
was
at
a
*NL*
distance
from
all
those
veiled
women
passing
to
and
fro
,
he
saw
before
*NL*
him
only
an
agitation
of
shadows
.
By
dint
of
attention
and
sharpness
*NL*
he
had
succeeded
in
clothing
all
those
phantoms
with
flesh
,
and
those
*NL*
corpses
were
alive
for
him
.
He
was
like
a
deaf
man
whose
sight
grows
*NL*
keener
,
and
like
a
blind
man
whose
hearing
becomes
more
acute
.
He
had
*NL*
applied
himself
to
riddling
out
the
significance
of
the
different
peals
,
*NL*
and
he
had
succeeded
,
so
that
this
taciturn
and
enigmatical
cloister
*NL*
possessed
no
secrets
for
him
;
the
sphinx
babbled
all
her
secrets
in
his
*NL*
ear
.
Fauchelevent
knew
all
and
concealed
all
;
that
constituted
his
art
.
*NL*
The
whole
convent
thought
him
stupid
.
A
great
merit
in
religion
.
The
*NL*
vocal
mothers
made
much
of
Fauchelevent
.
He
was
a
curious
mute
.
He
*NL*
inspired
confidence
.
Moreover
,
he
was
regular
,
and
never
went
out
except
*NL*
for
well-demonstrated
requirements
of
the
orchard
and
vegetable
garden
.
*NL*
This
discretion
of
conduct
had
inured
to
his
credit
.
None
the
less
,
he
*NL*
had
set
two
men
to
chattering
:
the
porter
,
in
the
convent
,
and
he
*NL*
knew
the
singularities
of
their
parlor
,
and
the
grave-digger
,
at
*NL*
the
cemetery
,
and
he
was
acquainted
with
the
peculiarities
of
their
*NL*
sepulture
;
in
this
way
,
he
possessed
a
double
light
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
these
nuns
,
one
as
to
their
life
,
the
other
as
to
their
death
.
But
he
*NL*
did
not
abuse
his
knowledge
.
The
congregation
thought
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
him
.
Old
,
lame
,
blind
to
everything
,
probably
a
little
deaf
into
the
*NL*
bargain
,
--
what
qualities
!
They
would
have
found
it
difficult
to
replace
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
goodman
,
with
the
assurance
of
a
person
who
feels
that
he
is
*NL*
appreciated
,
entered
into
a
rather
diffuse
and
very
deep
rustic
harangue
*NL*
to
the
reverend
prioress
.
He
talked
a
long
time
about
his
age
,
his
*NL*
infirmities
,
the
surcharge
of
years
counting
double
for
him
henceforth
,
*NL*
of
the
increasing
demands
of
his
work
,
of
the
great
size
of
the
garden
,
*NL*
of
nights
which
must
be
passed
,
like
the
last
,
for
instance
,
when
he
had
*NL*
been
obliged
to
put
straw
mats
over
the
melon
beds
,
because
of
the
moon
,
*NL*
and
he
wound
up
as
follows
:
``
That
he
had
a
brother
''
--
-LRB-
the
prioress
made
*NL*
a
movement
-RRB-
,
--
``
a
brother
no
longer
young
''
--
-LRB-
a
second
movement
on
the
*NL*
part
of
the
prioress
,
but
one
expressive
of
reassurance
-RRB-
,
--
``
that
,
if
he
*NL*
might
be
permitted
,
this
brother
would
come
and
live
with
him
and
help
*NL*
him
,
that
he
was
an
excellent
gardener
,
that
the
community
would
receive
*NL*
from
him
good
service
,
better
than
his
own
;
that
,
otherwise
,
if
his
*NL*
brother
were
not
admitted
,
as
he
,
the
elder
,
felt
that
his
health
was
*NL*
broken
and
that
he
was
insufficient
for
the
work
,
he
should
be
obliged
,
*NL*
greatly
to
his
regret
,
to
go
away
;
and
that
his
brother
had
a
little
*NL*
daughter
whom
he
would
bring
with
him
,
who
might
be
reared
for
God
in
*NL*
the
house
,
and
who
might
,
who
knows
,
become
a
nun
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
finished
speaking
,
the
prioress
stayed
the
slipping
of
her
*NL*
rosary
between
her
fingers
,
and
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
procure
a
stout
iron
bar
between
now
and
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
what
purpose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
serve
as
a
lever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
reverend
Mother
,
''
replied
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
,
without
adding
a
word
,
rose
and
entered
the
adjoining
*NL*
room
,
which
was
the
hall
of
the
chapter
,
and
where
the
vocal
mothers
*NL*
were
probably
assembled
.
Fauchelevent
was
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
III
--
MOTHER
INNOCENTE
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elapsed
.
The
prioress
returned
and
seated
*NL*
herself
once
more
on
her
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
interlocutors
seemed
preoccupied
.
We
will
present
a
stenographic
*NL*
report
of
the
dialogue
which
then
ensued
,
to
the
best
of
our
ability
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauvent
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reverend
Mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
the
chapel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
little
cage
there
,
where
I
hear
the
mass
and
the
offices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
have
been
in
the
choir
in
pursuance
of
your
duties
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
or
three
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
stone
to
be
raised
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
slab
of
the
pavement
which
is
at
the
side
of
the
altar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
slab
which
closes
the
vault
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
two
men
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
Ascension
,
who
is
as
strong
as
a
man
,
will
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
is
never
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
only
a
woman
here
to
help
you
.
Each
one
does
what
he
can
.
*NL*
Because
Dom
Mabillon
gives
four
hundred
and
seventeen
epistles
of
*NL*
Saint
Bernard
,
while
Merlonus
Horstius
only
gives
three
hundred
and
*NL*
sixty-seven
,
I
do
not
despise
Merlonus
Horstius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merit
consists
in
working
according
to
one
's
strength
.
A
cloister
is
*NL*
not
a
dock-yard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
woman
is
not
a
man
.
But
my
brother
is
the
strong
one
,
though
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
can
you
get
a
lever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
only
sort
of
key
that
fits
that
sort
of
door

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
ring
in
the
stone
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
put
the
lever
through
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
stone
is
so
arranged
that
it
swings
on
a
pivot

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
,
reverend
Mother

I
will
open
the
vault

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
four
Mother
Precentors
will
help
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
the
vault
is
open
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
closed
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
that
be
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
your
orders

very
reverend
Mother

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fauvent

have
confidence
in
you

open

close
it

before
that

``
What
,
reverend
Mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
must
be
lowered
into
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
ensued
.
The
prioress
,
after
a
pout
of
the
under
lip
which
*NL*
resembled
hesitation
,
broke
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauvent
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Reverend
Mother

*NL*
*NL*

Nothing

bottom

the
garden

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
distinguish
my
own
signal

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
died
at
daybreak

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then

the
wind

blowing

morning

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was

Crucifixion

A
blessed

*NL*
The
prioress
paused
,
moved
her
lips
,
as
though
in
mental
prayer
,
and
*NL*
resumed
:
--
*NL*

Three
years

Crucifixion

``

prioress
indulged
in
another
little
inward
murmur
,
probably
sacred
,
*NL*
then
raised
her
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
her
lifetime

Mother

made
converts
;
after

death

she
*NL*
will
perform

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will

''
replied
Father
Fauchelevent
,
falling
into
step
,
and
striving
*NL*
not
to
flinch
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauvent
,
the
community
has
been
blessed
in
Mother
Crucifixion
.
*NL*
No
doubt
,
it
is
not
granted
to
every
one
to
die
,
like
Cardinal
de
*NL*
Berulle
,
while
saying
the
holy
mass
,
and
to
breathe
forth
their
souls
to
*NL*
God
,
while
pronouncing
these
words
:
Hanc
igitur
oblationem

But
without
*NL*
attaining
to
such
happiness
,
Mother
Crucifixion
's
death
was
very
*NL*
precious
.
She
retained
her
consciousness
to
the
very
last
moment
.
*NL*
She
spoke
to
us
,
then
she
spoke
to
the
angels
.
She
gave
us
her
last
*NL*
commands
.
If
you
had
a
little
more
faith
,
and
if
you
could
have
been
*NL*
in
her
cell
,
she
would
have
cured
your
leg
merely
by
touching
it

*NL*
She
smiled

We
felt
that
she
was
regaining
her
life
in
God
.
There
was
*NL*
something
of
paradise
in
that
death

*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
thought
that
it
was
an
orison
which
she
was
finishing

took
off
several

Fauchelevent
held
*NL*
his

*NL*
*NL*
She
went
on
:

with

that

dismisses

The

looked
fixedly
at

the
gardener

The

stuck
fast
in

made
haste

went
towards

CHAPTER
IV
--
IN
WHICH
JEAN
VALJEAN
HAS
QUITE
THE
AIR
OF
HAVING
READ
*NL*
AUSTIN
CASTILLEJO
*NL*
*NL*
The
strides
of
a
lame
man
are
like
the
ogling
glances
of
a
one-eyed
man
;
*NL*
they
do
not
reach
their
goal
very
promptly
.
Moreover
,
Fauchelevent
*NL*
was
in
a
dilemma
.
He
took
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
to
return
to
his
*NL*
cottage
in
the
garden
.
Cosette
had
waked
up
.
Jean
Valjean
had
placed
her
*NL*
near
the
fire
.
At
the
moment
when
Fauchelevent
entered
,
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
pointing
out
to
her
the
vintner
's
basket
on
the
wall
,
and
saying
to
her
,
*NL*
``
Listen
attentively
to
me
,
my
little
Cosette
.
We
must
go
away
from
this
*NL*
house
,
but
we
shall
return
to
it
,
and
we
shall
be
very
happy
here
.
The
*NL*
good
man
who
lives
here
is
going
to
carry
you
off
on
his
back
in
that
.
*NL*
You
will
wait
for
me
at
a
lady
's
house
.
I
shall
come
to
fetch
you
.
Obey
,
*NL*
and
say
nothing
,
above
all
things
,
unless
you
want
Madame
Thenardier
to
*NL*
get
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
nodded
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
round
at
the
noise
made
by
Fauchelevent
opening
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
arranged
,
and
nothing
is
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
.
``
I
have
*NL*
permission
to
bring
you
in
;
but
before
bringing
you
in
you
must
be
*NL*
got
out
.
That
's
where
the
difficulty
lies
.
It
is
easy
enough
with
the
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
carry
her
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
will
hold
her
tongue
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
answer
for
that

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
,
Father
Madeleine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
after
a
silence
,
fraught
with
anxiety
,
Fauchelevent
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
get
out
as
you
came
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
as
in
the
first
instance
,
contented
himself
with
saying
,
*NL*
``
Impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
grumbled
,
more
to
himself
than
to
Jean
Valjean
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
another
thing
which
bothers
me
.
I
have
said
that
I
would
put
*NL*
earth
in
it
.
When
I
come
to
think
it
over
,
the
earth
instead
of
the
*NL*
corpse
will
not
seem
like
the
real
thing
,
it
wo
n't
do
,
it
will
get
*NL*
displaced
,
it
will
move
about
.
The
men
will
bear
it
.
You
understand
,
*NL*
Father
Madeleine
,
the
government
will
notice
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stared
him
straight
in
the
eye
and
thought
that
he
was
*NL*
raving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
the
de
--
uce
are
you
going
to
get
out
?
It
must
all
be
done
by
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
It
is
to-morrow
that
I
am
to
bring
you
in
.
The
*NL*
prioress
expects
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
explained
to
Jean
Valjean
that
this
was
his
recompense
for
a
*NL*
service
which
he
,
Fauchelevent
,
was
to
render
to
the
community
.
That
it
*NL*
fell
among
his
duties
to
take
part
in
their
burials
,
that
he
nailed
up
*NL*
the
coffins
and
helped
the
grave-digger
at
the
cemetery
.
That
the
nun
*NL*
who
had
died
that
morning
had
requested
to
be
buried
in
the
coffin
which
*NL*
had
served
her
for
a
bed
,
and
interred
in
the
vault
under
the
altar
of
*NL*
the
chapel
.
That
the
police
regulations
forbade
this
,
but
that
she
was
*NL*
one
of
those
dead
to
whom
nothing
is
refused
.
That
the
prioress
and
the
*NL*
vocal
mothers
intended
to
fulfil
the
wish
of
the
deceased
.
That
it
was
*NL*
so
much
the
worse
for
the
government
.
That
he
,
Fauchelevent
,
was
to
nail
*NL*
up
the
coffin
in
the
cell
,
raise
the
stone
in
the
chapel
,
and
lower
the
*NL*
corpse
into
the
vault
.
And
that
,
by
way
of
thanks
,
the
prioress
was
to
*NL*
admit
his
brother
to
the
house
as
a
gardener
,
and
his
niece
as
a
pupil
.
*NL*
That
his
brother
was
M.
Madeleine
,
and
that
his
niece
was
Cosette
.
That
*NL*
the
prioress
had
told
him
to
bring
his
brother
on
the
following
evening
,
*NL*
after
the
counterfeit
interment
in
the
cemetery
.
But
that
he
could
not
*NL*
bring
M.
Madeleine
in
from
the
outside
if
M.
Madeleine
was
not
outside
.
*NL*
That
that
was
the
first
problem
.
And
then
,
that
there
was
another
:
the
*NL*
empty
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
empty
coffin
?
''
asked
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

up

up

as
much
amazement
as

in

Fauchelevent
recoiled

cracked
his

*NL*

Impossible

*NL*
*NL*
What
seemed
unprecedented
to
Fauchelevent
was
,
we
repeat
,
a
simple
*NL*
matter
to
Jean
Valjean
.
Jean
Valjean
had
been
in
worse
straits
than
*NL*
this
.
Any
man
who
has
been
a
prisoner
understands
how
to
contract
*NL*
himself
to
fit
the
diameter
of
the
escape
.
The
prisoner
is
subject
to
*NL*
flight
as
the
sick
man
is
subject
to
a
crisis
which
saves
or
kills
him
.
*NL*
An
escape
is
a
cure
.
What
does
not
a
man
undergo
for
the
sake
of
a
*NL*
cure
?
To
have
himself
nailed
up
in
a
case
and
carried
off
like
a
bale
*NL*
of
goods
,
to
live
for
a
long
time
in
a
box
,
to
find
air
where
there
is
*NL*
none
,
to
economize
his
breath
for
hours
,
to
know
how
to
stifle
without
*NL*
dying
--
this
was
one
of
Jean
Valjean
's
gloomy
talents
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
a
coffin
containing
a
living
being
,
--
that
convict
's
*NL*
expedient
,
--
is
also
an
imperial
expedient
.
If
we
are
to
credit
the
monk
*NL*
Austin
Castillejo
,
this
was
the
means
employed
by
Charles
the
Fifth
,
*NL*
desirous
of
seeing
the
Plombes
for
the
last
time
after
his
abdication
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
her
brought
into
and
carried
out
of
the
monastery
of
Saint-Yuste
*NL*
in
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
who
had
recovered
himself
a
little
,
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
will
you
manage
to
breathe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
breathe

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

box
!
The
mere
thought
of
it
suffocates
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
surely
must
have
a
gimlet
,
you
will
make
a
few
holes
here
and
*NL*
there
,
around
my
mouth
,
and
you
will
nail
the
top
plank
on
loosely

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

And
what
if
you
should
happen

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
who
is
making
his
escape
does
not
cough

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jean
Valjean
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauchelevent
,
we
must
come
to
a
decision
:
I
must
either
be

caught
here
,
or
accept
this
escape
through
the
hearse
.

*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
has
noticed
the
taste
which
cats
have
for
pausing
and
lounging
*NL*
between
the
two
leaves
of
a
half-shut
door
.
Who
is
there
who
has
not
*NL*
said
to
a
cat
,
``
Do
come
in
!
''
There
are
men
who
,
when
an
incident
stands
*NL*
half-open
before
them
,
have
the
same
tendency
to
halt
in
indecision
*NL*
between
two
resolutions
,
at
the
risk
of
getting
crushed
through
the
*NL*
abrupt
closing
of
the
adventure
by
fate
.
The
over-prudent
,
cats
as
they
*NL*
are
,
and
because
they
are
cats
,
sometimes
incur
more
danger
than
*NL*
the
audacious
.
Fauchelevent
was
of
this
hesitating
nature
.
But
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
coolness
prevailed
over
him
in
spite
of
himself
.
He
*NL*
grumbled
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
since
there
is
no
other
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
which
troubles
me
is
what
will
take
place
at
the
*NL*
cemetery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
very
point
that
is
not
troublesome
,
''
exclaimed
*NL*
Fauchelevent
.
``
If
you
are
sure
of
coming
out
of
the
coffin
all
right

I
*NL*
am
sure
of
getting
you
out
of
the
grave

The
grave-digger

a
drunkard

*NL*
and
a
friend
of
mine

He
is
Father
Mestienne

An
old
fellow
of
the
old
*NL*
school

The
grave-digger
puts
the
corpses
in
the
grave
,
and
I
put
the
*NL*
grave-digger
in
my
pocket

I
will
tell
you
what
will
take

dusk

three-quarters

an
hour

gates

you

says
the
prayers

makes
the
sign

the
cross

sprinkles
the
holy

water

takes
his
departure

I

left
alone

I
tell

One

I
lay

take
his
card

Jean

held
out
his

CHAPTER
V
--
IT
IS
NOT
NECESSARY
TO
BE
DRUNK
IN
ORDER
TO
BE
IMMORTAL
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
as
the
sun
was
declining
,
the
very
rare
passers-by
*NL*
on
the
Boulevard
du
Maine
pulled
off
their
hats
to
an
old-fashioned
*NL*
hearse
,
ornamented
with
skulls
,
cross-bones
,
and
tears
.
This
hearse
*NL*
contained
a
coffin
covered
with
a
white
cloth
over
which
spread
a
large
*NL*
black
cross
,
like
a
huge
corpse
with
drooping
arms
.
A
mourning-coach
,
in
*NL*
which
could
be
seen
a
priest
in
his
surplice
,
and
a
choir
boy
in
his
red
*NL*
cap
,
followed
.
Two
undertaker
's
men
in
gray
uniforms
trimmed
with
black
*NL*
walked
on
the
right
and
the
left
of
the
hearse
.
Behind
it
came
an
old
*NL*
man
in
the
garments
of
a
laborer
,
who
limped
along
.
The
procession
was
*NL*
going
in
the
direction
of
the
Vaugirard
cemetery
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handle
of
a
hammer
,
the
blade
of
a
cold
chisel
,
and
the
antennae
of
*NL*
a
pair
of
pincers
were
visible
,
protruding
from
the
man
's
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Vaugirard
cemetery
formed
an
exception
among
the
cemeteries
of
*NL*
Paris
.
It
had
its
peculiar
usages
,
just
as
it
had
its
carriage
*NL*
entrance
and
its
house
door
,
which
old
people
in
the
quarter
,
who
clung
*NL*
tenaciously
to
ancient
words
,
still
called
the
porte
cavaliere
and
the
*NL*
porte
pietonne
.
-LSB-
16
-RSB-
The
Bernardines-Benedictines
of
the
Rue
Petit-Picpus
*NL*
had
obtained
permission
,
as
we
have
already
stated
,
to
be
buried
there
*NL*
in
a
corner
apart
,
and
at
night
,
the
plot
of
land
having
formerly
*NL*
belonged
to
their
community
.
The
grave-diggers
being
thus
bound
to
*NL*
service
in
the
evening
in
summer
and
at
night
in
winter
,
in
this
*NL*
cemetery
,
they
were
subjected
to
a
special
discipline
.
The
gates
of
the
*NL*
Paris
cemeteries
closed
,
at
that
epoch
,
at
sundown
,
and
this
being
a
*NL*
municipal
regulation
,
the
Vaugirard
cemetery
was
bound
by
it
like
the
*NL*
rest
.
The
carriage
gate
and
the
house
door
were
two
contiguous
grated
*NL*
gates
,
adjoining
a
pavilion
built
by
the
architect
Perronet
,
and
*NL*
inhabited
by
the
door-keeper
of
the
cemetery
.
These
gates
,
therefore
,
*NL*
swung
inexorably
on
their
hinges
at
the
instant
when
the
sun
disappeared
*NL*
behind
the
dome
of
the
Invalides
.
If
any
grave-digger
were
delayed
*NL*
after
that
moment
in
the
cemetery
,
there
was
but
one
way
for
him
to
*NL*
get
out
--
his
grave-digger
's
card
furnished
by
the
department
of
public
*NL*
funerals
.
A
sort
of
letter-box
was
constructed
in
the
porter
's
window
.
*NL*
The
grave-digger
dropped
his
card
into
this
box
,
the
porter
heard
it
*NL*
fall
,
pulled
the
rope
,
and
the
small
door
opened
.
If
the
man
had
not
his
*NL*
card
,
he
mentioned
his
name
,
the
porter
,
who
was
sometimes
in
bed
and
*NL*
asleep
,
rose
,
came
out
and
identified
the
man
,
and
opened
the
gate
with
*NL*
his
key
;
the
grave-digger
stepped
out
,
but
had
to
pay
a
fine
of
fifteen
*NL*
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cemetery
,
with
its
peculiarities
outside
the
regulations
,
*NL*
embarrassed
the
symmetry
of
the
administration
.
It
was
suppressed
*NL*
a
little
later
than
1830
.
The
cemetery
of
Mont-Parnasse
,
called
the
*NL*
Eastern
cemetery
,
succeeded
to
it
,
and
inherited
that
famous
dram-shop
*NL*
next
to
the
Vaugirard
cemetery
,
which
was
surmounted
by
a
quince
painted
*NL*
on
a
board
,
and
which
formed
an
angle
,
one
side
on
the
drinkers
'
tables
,
*NL*
and
the
other
on
the
tombs
,
with
this
sign
:
Au
Bon
Coing

*NL*
*NL*
The
Vaugirard
cemetery
was
what
may
be
called
a
faded
cemetery
.
It
*NL*
was
falling
into
disuse
.
Dampness
was
invading
it
,
the
flowers
were
*NL*
deserting
it
.
The
bourgeois
did
not
care
much
about
being
buried
in
*NL*
the
Vaugirard
;
it
hinted
at
poverty
.
Pere-Lachaise
if
you
please
!
to
be
*NL*
buried
in
Pere-Lachaise
is
equivalent
to
having
furniture
of
mahogany
.
*NL*
It
is
recognized
as
elegant
.
The
Vaugirard
cemetery
was
a
venerable
*NL*
enclosure
,
planted
like
an
old-fashioned
French
garden
.
Straight
alleys
,
*NL*
box
,
thuya-trees
,
holly
,
ancient
tombs
beneath
aged
cypress-trees
,
and
*NL*
very
tall
grass
.
In
the
evening
it
was
tragic
there
.
There
were
very
*NL*
lugubrious
lines
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
not
yet
set
when
the
hearse
with
the
white
pall
and
the
*NL*
black
cross
entered
the
avenue
of
the
Vaugirard
cemetery
.
The
lame
man
*NL*
who
followed
it
was
no
other
than
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interment
of
Mother
Crucifixion
in
the
vault
under
the
altar
,
the
*NL*
exit
of
Cosette
,
the
introduction
of
Jean
Valjean
to
the
dead-room
,
--
all
*NL*
had
been
executed
without
difficulty
,
and
there
had
been
no
hitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
remark
in
passing
,
that
the
burial
of
Mother
Crucifixion
under
*NL*
the
altar
of
the
convent
is
a
perfectly
venial
offence
in
our
sight
.
It
*NL*
is
one
of
the
faults
which
resemble
a
duty
.
The
nuns
had
committed
it
,
*NL*
not
only
without
difficulty
,
but
even
with
the
applause
of
their
own
*NL*
consciences
.
In
the
cloister
,
what
is
called
the
``
government
''
is
only
*NL*
an
intermeddling
with
authority
,
an
interference
which
is
always
*NL*
questionable
.
In
the
first
place
,
the
rule
;
as
for
the
code
,
we
shall
*NL*
see
.
Make
as
many
laws
as
you
please
,
men
;
but
keep
them
for
yourselves
.
*NL*
The
tribute
to
Caesar
is
never
anything
but
the
remnants
of
the
tribute
*NL*
to
God
.
A
prince
is
nothing
in
the
presence
of
a
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
limped
along
behind
the
hearse
in
a
very
contented
frame
*NL*
of
mind
.
His
twin
plots
,
the
one
with
the
nuns
,
the
one
for
the
convent
,
*NL*
the
other
against
it
,
the
other
with
M.
Madeleine
,
had
succeeded
,
to
*NL*
all
appearance
.
Jean
Valjean
's
composure
was
one
of
those
powerful
*NL*
tranquillities
which
are
contagious
.
Fauchelevent
no
longer
felt
*NL*
doubtful
as
to
his
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
remained
to
be
done
was
a
mere
nothing
.
Within
the
last
two
years
,
*NL*
he
had
made
good
Father
Mestienne
,
a
chubby-cheeked
person
,
drunk
at
*NL*
least
ten
times
.
He
played
with
Father
Mestienne
.
He
did
what
he
liked
*NL*
with
him
.
He
made
him
dance
according
to
his
whim
.
Mestienne
's
head
*NL*
adjusted
itself
to
the
cap
of
Fauchelevent
's
will
.
Fauchelevent
's
*NL*
confidence
was
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
convoy
entered
the
avenue
leading
to
the
*NL*
cemetery
,
Fauchelevent
glanced
cheerfully
at
the
hearse
,
and
said
half
*NL*
aloud
,
as
he
rubbed
his
big
hands
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
fine
farce
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
the
hearse
halted
;
it
had
reached
the
gate
.
The
permission
*NL*
for
interment
must
be
exhibited
.
The
undertaker
's
man
addressed
himself
*NL*
to
the
porter
of
the
cemetery
.
During
this
colloquy
,
which
always
is
*NL*
productive
of
a
delay
of
from
one
to
two
minutes
,
some
one
,
a
stranger
,
*NL*
came
and
placed
himself
behind
the
hearse
,
beside
Fauchelevent
.
He
was
*NL*
a
sort
of
laboring
man
,
who
wore
a
waistcoat
with
large
pockets
and
*NL*
carried
a
mattock
under
his
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
surveyed
this
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
grave-digger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
man
could
survive
the
blow
of
a
cannon-ball
full
in
the
breast
,
he
*NL*
would
make
the
same
face
that
Fauchelevent
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
grave-digger
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Mestienne
is
the
grave-digger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
He
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
had
expected
anything
but
this
,
that
a
grave-digger
could
*NL*
die
.
It
is
true
,
nevertheless
,
that
grave-diggers
do
die
themselves
.
By
*NL*
dint
of
excavating
graves
for
other
people
,
one
hollows
out
one
's
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
stood
there
with
his
mouth
wide
open
.
He
had
hardly
the
*NL*
strength
to
stammer
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
not
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
he
persisted
feebly
,
``
Father
Mestienne
is
the
grave-digger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
Napoleon
,
Louis
XVIII

After

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
who
was
deadly
pale
,
stared
at
this
Gribier
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
tall
,
thin
,
livid
,
utterly
funereal
man
.
He
had
the
air
of
an
*NL*
unsuccessful
doctor
who
had
turned
grave-digger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
he
,
``
what
queer
things
do
happen
!
Father
Mestienne
is
dead

*NL*
but

Do
you
know

*NL*
We
'll
go
and
have
a

together
presently

*NL*
*NL*
The
man
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
a
student

I
passed
my
fourth
examination

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hearse
had
set
out
again
,
and
was
rolling
up
the
grand
alley
of
the
*NL*
cemetery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
had
slackened
his
pace
.
He
limped
more
out
of
anxiety
than
*NL*
from
infirmity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
walked
on
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
passed
the
unexpected
Gribier
once
more
in
review
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
one
of
those
men
who
,
though
very
young
,
have
the
air
of
age
,
and
*NL*
who
,
though
slender
,
are
extremely
strong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comrade

''
cried
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
who
was
illiterate
but
very
sharp
,
understood
that
he
*NL*
had
to
deal
with
a
formidable
species
of
man
,
with
a
fine
talker

He
*NL*
muttered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

Mestienne

dead

*NL*
*NL*
The
man
replied
:

*NL*
``

repeated
mechanically
:

said
the

authoritatively

*NL*
*NL*
``

Fauchelevent

*NL*
*NL*
``
Business

*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
thought
:
``
I
am
lost

*NL*
*NL*
They
were
only
a
few
turns
of
the
wheel
distant
from
the
small
alley
*NL*
leading
to
the
nuns
'
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peasant
,
I
have
seven
small
children

must
be
fed

As
they
must
eat
,
*NL*
I
can
not
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
,
with
the
satisfaction
of
a
serious
man
who
is
turning
a
*NL*
phrase
well
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
hunger
is
the
enemy
of
my
thirst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hearse
skirted
a
clump
of
cypress-trees
,
quitted
the
grand
alley
,
*NL*
turned
into
a
narrow
one
,
entered
the
waste
land
,
and
plunged
into
*NL*
a
thicket
.
This
indicated
the
immediate
proximity
of
the
place
of
*NL*
sepulture
.
Fauchelevent
slackened
his
pace
,
but
he
could
not
detain
the
*NL*
hearse
.
Fortunately
,
the
soil
,
which
was
light
and
wet
with
the
winter
*NL*
rains
,
clogged
the
wheels
and
retarded
its
speed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
grave-digger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
such
a
nice
little
Argenteuil
wine
,
''
murmured
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Villager
,
''
retorted
the
man
,
``
I
ought
not
be
a
grave-digger

My
*NL*
father
was
a
porter
at
the
Prytaneum
-LSB-
Town-Hall
-RSB-
.
He
destined
me
for
*NL*
literature
.
But
he
had
reverses
.
He
had
losses
on
`
change
.
I
was
obliged
*NL*
to
renounce
the
profession
of
author

But
I
am
still
a
public
writer

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
not
a
grave-digger
,
then
?
''
returned
Fauchelevent
,
clutching
*NL*
at
this
branch
,
feeble
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
does
not
hinder
the
other

I
cumulate

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
did
not
understand
this
last
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
have
a
drink
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
remark
becomes
necessary
.
Fauchelevent
,
whatever
his
anguish
,
*NL*
offered
a
drink
,
but
he
did
not
explain
himself
on
one
point
;
who
was
to
*NL*
pay
?
Generally
,
Fauchelevent
offered
and
Father
Mestienne
paid
.
An
offer
*NL*
of
a
drink
was
the
evident
result
of
the
novel
situation
created
by
the
*NL*
new
grave-digger
,
and
it
was
necessary
to
make
this
offer
,
but
the
old
*NL*
gardener
left
the
proverbial
quarter
of
an
hour
named
after
Rabelais
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
and
that
not
unintentionally
.
As
for
himself
,
Fauchelevent
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
pay
,
troubled
as
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
went
on
with
a
superior
smile
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
must
eat

I
have
accepted
Father
Mestienne

reversion

One
gets

one
has
nearly
completed
his
classes

To
the
labor
*NL*
of
the
hand
I
join
the
labor

arm

I
have

In
the
morning
I
write

in
the

evening
I
dig

Such
is

rustic

*NL*
*NL*
The
hearse
was
still
advancing
.
Fauchelevent
,
uneasy
to
the
last
degree
,
*NL*
was
gazing
about
him
on
all
sides

Great
drops
of
perspiration
trickled
*NL*
down
from
his
brow

*NL*
*NL*
``

continued
the
grave-digger
,
``
a
man

not
serve

choose
between

*NL*
*NL*
The
hearse
halted

*NL*
*NL*
The

boy
alighted
from
the
mourning-coach

then
the
priest

*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
small
front
wheels
of
the
hearse
had
run
up
a
little
on
a

pile
of
earth
,
beyond
which
an
open
grave
was
visible

CHAPTER
VI
--
BETWEEN
FOUR
PLANKS
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
in
the
coffin
?
The
reader
knows
.
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
arranged
things
so
that
he
could
exist
there
,
and
he
*NL*
could
almost
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
strange
thing
to
what
a
degree
security
of
conscience
confers
*NL*
security
of
the
rest
.
Every
combination
thought
out
by
Jean
Valjean
had
*NL*
been
progressing
,
and
progressing
favorably
,
since
the
preceding
day
.
*NL*
He
,
like
Fauchelevent
,
counted
on
Father
Mestienne
.
He
had
no
doubt
*NL*
as
to
the
end
.
Never
was
there
a
more
critical
situation
,
never
more
*NL*
complete
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
four
planks
of
the
coffin
breathe
out
a
kind
of
terrible
peace
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
though
something
of
the
repose
of
the
dead
entered
into
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
depths
of
that
coffin
he
had
been
able
to
follow
,
and
he
had
*NL*
followed
,
all
the
phases
of
the
terrible
drama
which
he
was
playing
with
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
after
Fauchelevent
had
finished
nailing
on
the
upper
plank
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
had
felt
himself
carried
out
,
then
driven
off
.
He
knew
,
from
the
*NL*
diminution
in
the
jolting
,
when
they
left
the
pavements
and
reached
the
*NL*
earth
road
.
He
had
divined
,
from
a
dull
noise
,
that
they
were
crossing
*NL*
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
.
At
the
first
halt
,
he
had
understood
that
they
*NL*
were
entering
the
cemetery
;
at
the
second
halt
,
he
said
to
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
he
felt
hands
seize
the
coffin
,
then
a
harsh
grating
against
*NL*
the
planks
;
he
explained
it
to
himself
as
the
rope
which
was
being
*NL*
fastened
round
the
casket
in
order
to
lower
it
into
the
cavity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
experienced
a
giddiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
undertaker
's
man
and
the
grave-digger
had
probably
allowed
the
*NL*
coffin
to
lose
its
balance
,
and
had
lowered
the
head
before
the
foot
.
He
*NL*
recovered
himself
fully
when
he
felt
himself
horizontal
and
motionless
.
*NL*
He
had
just
touched
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
certain
sensation
of
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
rose
above
him
,
glacial
and
solemn
.
He
heard
Latin
words
,
which
*NL*
he
did
not
understand
,
pass
over
him
,
so
slowly
that
he
was
able
to
*NL*
catch
them
one
by
one
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Qui
dormiunt
in
terrae
pulvere
,
evigilabunt
;
alii
in
vitam
aeternam
,
et
*NL*
alii
in
approbrium
,
ut
videant
semper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
child
's
voice
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
De
profundis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave
voice
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Requiem
aeternam
dona
ei
,
Domine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
's
voice
responded
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Et
lux
perpetua
luceat
ei
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
something
like
the
gentle
patter
of
several
drops
of
rain
on
*NL*
the
plank
which
covered
him
.
It
was
probably
the
holy
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
:
``
This
will
be
over
soon
now
.
Patience
for
a
little
while
*NL*
longer
.
The
priest
will
take
his
departure
.
Fauchelevent
will
take
*NL*
Mestienne
off
to
drink
.
I
shall
be
left
.
Then
Fauchelevent
will
return
*NL*
alone
,
and
I
shall
get
out
.
That
will
be
the
work
of
a
good
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave
voice
resumed
*NL*
*NL*
``
Requiescat
in
pace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
child
's
voice
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
strained
his
ears
,
and
heard
something
like
retreating
*NL*
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
they
are
going
now
,
''
thought
he
.
``
I
am
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
heard
over
his
head
a
sound
which
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
*NL*
clap
of
thunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
shovelful
of
earth
falling
on
the
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
shovelful
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
holes
through
which
he
breathed
had
just
been
stopped
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
third
shovelful
of
earth
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
fourth
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
things
which
are
too
strong
for
the
strongest
man
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
lost
consciousness
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
IN
WHICH
WILL
BE
FOUND
THE
ORIGIN
OF
THE
SAYING
:
DO
N'T
LOSE
*NL*
THE
CARD
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
had
taken
place
above
the
coffin
in
which
lay
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
hearse
had
driven
off
,
when
the
priest
and
the
choir
boy
had
*NL*
entered
the
carriage
again
and
taken
their
departure
,
Fauchelevent
,
who
*NL*
had
not
taken
his
eyes
from
the
grave-digger
,
saw
the
latter
bend
over
*NL*
and
grasp
his
shovel
,
which
was
sticking
upright
in
the
heap
of
dirt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Fauchelevent
took
a
supreme
resolve
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
himself
between
the
grave
and
the
grave-digger
,
crossed
his
*NL*
arms
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
one
to
pay
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
stared
at
him
in
amazement
,
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
,
peasant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
repeated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
one
who
pays
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Argenteuil
wine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
Argenteuil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Bon
Coing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
the
devil
!
''
said
the
grave-digger
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
flung
a
shovelful
of
earth
on
the
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coffin
gave
back
a
hollow
sound
.
Fauchelevent
felt
himself
stagger
*NL*
and
on
the
point
of
falling
headlong
into
the
grave
himself
.
He
shouted
*NL*
in
a
voice
in
which
the
strangling
sound
of
the
death
rattle
began
to
*NL*
mingle
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comrade
!
Before
the
Bon
Coing
is
shut
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
took
some
more
earth
on
his
shovel
.
Fauchelevent
*NL*
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
seized
the
man
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
to
me
,
comrade
.
I
am
the
convent
grave-digger
,
I
have
come
*NL*
to
help
you
.
It
is
a
business
which
can
be
performed
at
night
.
Let
us
*NL*
begin
,
then
,
by
going
for
a
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
spoke
,
and
clung
to
this
desperate
insistence
,
this
melancholy
*NL*
reflection
occurred
to
him
:
``
And
if
he
drinks
,
will
he
get
drunk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Provincial
,
''
said
the
man
,
``
if
you
positively
insist
upon
it
,
I
*NL*
consent
.
We
will
drink
.
After
work
,
never
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
flourished
his
shovel
briskly
.
Fauchelevent
held
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Argenteuil
wine
,
at
six
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
come
,
''
said
the
grave-digger
,
``
you
are
a
bell-ringer
.
Ding
dong
,
*NL*
ding
dong
,
that
's
all
you
know
how
to
say
.
Go
hang
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
threw
in
a
second
shovelful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
had
reached
a
point
where
he
no
longer
knew
what
he
was
*NL*
saying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
and
drink
,
''
he
cried
,
``
since
it
is
I
who
pays
the
bill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
we
have
put
the
child
to
bed
,
''
said
the
grave-digger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
in
a
third
shovelful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
thrust
his
shovel
into
the
earth
and
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
cold
to-night
,
you
see
,
and
the
corpse
would
shriek
out
after
us
*NL*
if
we
were
to
plant
her
there
without
a
coverlet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
as
he
loaded
his
shovel
,
the
grave-digger
bent
over
,
*NL*
and
the
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
gaped
.
Fauchelevent
's
wild
gaze
fell
*NL*
mechanically
into
that
pocket
,
and
there
it
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
not
yet
hidden
behind
the
horizon
;
there
was
still
light
*NL*
enough
to
enable
him
to
distinguish
something
white
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
that
yawning
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sum
total
of
lightning
that
the
eye
of
a
Picard
peasant
can
contain
,
*NL*
traversed
Fauchelevent
's
pupils
.
An
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thrust
his
hand
into
the
pocket
from
behind
,
without
the
*NL*
grave-digger
,
who
was
wholly
absorbed
in
his
shovelful
of
earth
,
*NL*
observing
it
,
and
pulled
out
the
white
object
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
sent
a
fourth
shovelful
tumbling
into
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
he
turned
round
to
get
the
fifth
,
Fauchelevent
looked
calmly
at
*NL*
him
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
you
new
man
,
have
you
your
card
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
card
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sun
is
on
the
point
of
setting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
,
it
is
going
to
put
on
its
nightcap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gate
of
the
cemetery
will
close
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
your
card
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
my
card
?
''
said
the
grave-digger
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
fumbled
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
searched
one
pocket
,
he
proceeded
to
search
the
other
.
He
passed
*NL*
on
to
his
fobs
,
explored
the
first
,
returned
to
the
second
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
have
not
my
card
.
I
must
have
forgotten
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
francs
fine

''
said
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
turned
green
.
Green
is
the
pallor
of
livid
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

he

*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
pieces

sous

said
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grave-digger
dropped
his
shovel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
's
turn
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
now

conscript

''
said
Fauchelevent
,
``
none
of
this
despair

*NL*
There
is
no

committing
suicide

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
The
grave-digger
,
overwhelmed
with
gratitude

shook
his
hand
and
set
off
*NL*
on
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
man
had
disappeared
in
the
thicket
,
Fauchelevent
listened
until
*NL*
he
heard
his
footsteps
die
away
in
the
distance
,
then
he
leaned
over
the
*NL*
grave
,
and
said
in
a
low
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Madeleine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
reply

*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
was
seized
with
a
shudder
.
He
tumbled
rather
than
climbed
*NL*
into
the
grave
,
flung
himself
on
the
head
of
the
coffin
and
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
in
the
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
hardly
able
to
draw
his
breath
for
trembling
,
seized
his
*NL*
cold
chisel
and
his
hammer
,
and
pried
up
the
coffin
lid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
face
appeared
in
the
twilight
;
it
was
pale
and
his
eyes
*NL*
were
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
's
hair
rose
upright
on
his
head
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
then
fell
back
against
the
side
of
the
grave
,
ready
to
swoon
on
the
*NL*
coffin
.
He
stared
at
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
lay
there
pallid
and
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
murmured
in
a
voice
as
faint
as
a
sigh
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
drawing
himself
up
,
and
folding
his
arms
with
such
violence
that
*NL*
his
clenched
fists
came
in
contact
with
his
shoulders
,
he
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
the
way
I
save
his
life
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
poor
man
fell
to
sobbing
.
He
soliloquized
the
while
,
for
it
is
*NL*
an
error
to
suppose
that
the
soliloquy
is
unnatural
.
Powerful
emotion
*NL*
often
talks
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
Father
Mestienne
's
fault

Why
did
that
fool
die
?
What
need
was
*NL*
there
for
him
to
give
up
the
ghost
at
the
very
moment
when
no
one
was
*NL*
expecting
it
?
It
is
he
who
has
killed
M.
Madeleine

Father
Madeleine

*NL*
He
is
in
the
coffin

It

quite

All
is
over

there
any

sense

Ah

Well

and
his
little
*NL*
girl
,
what
am
I
to
do
with
her

What
will
the
fruit-seller
say
?
The
idea
*NL*
of
its
being
possible
for
a
man
like
that
to
die
like
this

When
I

put
himself

Here
's
a
pretty
trick
to
play

good

man
out

myself
.
I
shall
stay
here
.
After
*NL*
having
done
such
a
thing
as
that
!
What
's
the
use
of
being
two
old
men
,
*NL*
if
we
are
two
old
fools
!
But
,
in
the
first
place
,
how
did
he
manage
to
*NL*
enter
the
convent
?
That
was
the
beginning
of
it
all
.
One
should
not
*NL*
do
such
things
.
Father
Madeleine
!
Father
Madeleine
!
Father
Madeleine
!
*NL*
Madeleine
!
Monsieur
Madeleine
!
Monsieur
le
Maire
!
He
does
not
hear
me
.
*NL*
Now
get
out
of
this
scrape
if
you
can
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
tore
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
grating
sound
became
audible
through
the
trees
in
the
distance
.
It
was
*NL*
the
cemetery
gate
closing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
bent
over
Jean
Valjean
,
and
all
at
once
he
bounded
back
and
*NL*
recoiled
so
far
as
the
limits
of
a
grave
permit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
eyes
were
open
and
gazing
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
see
a
corpse
is
alarming
,
to
behold
a
resurrection
is
almost
as
much
*NL*
so
.
Fauchelevent
became
like
stone
,
pale
,
haggard
,
overwhelmed
by
all
*NL*
these
excesses
of
emotion
,
not
knowing
whether
he
had
to
do
with
a
*NL*
living
man
or
a
dead
one
,
and
staring
at
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
gazing
at
*NL*
him
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fell
asleep
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
raised
himself
to
a
sitting
posture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
fell
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
,
good
Virgin
!
How
you
frightened
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
Father
Madeleine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
merely
fainted
.
The
fresh
air
had
revived
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joy
is
the
ebb
of
terror
.
Fauchelevent
found
almost
as
much
difficulty
*NL*
in
recovering
himself
as
Jean
Valjean
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
not
dead
!
Oh
!
How
wise
you
are
!
I
called
you
so
much
that
*NL*
you
came
back
.
When
I
saw
your
eyes
shut
,
I
said
:
`
Good
!
there
he
is
,
*NL*
stifled
,
'
I
should
have
gone
raving
mad
,
mad
enough
for
a
strait
jacket
.
*NL*
They
would
have
put
me
in
Bicetre
.
What
do
you
suppose
I
should
*NL*
have
done
if
you
had
been
dead
?
And
your
little
girl
?
There
's
that
*NL*
fruit-seller
,
--
she
would
never
have
understood
it
!
The
child
is
thrust
*NL*
into
your
arms
,
and
then
--
the
grandfather
is
dead
!
What
a
story
!
good
*NL*
saints
of
paradise
,
what
a
tale
!
Ah
!
you
are
alive
,
that
's
the
best
of
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
cold
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
recalled
Fauchelevent
thoroughly
to
reality
,
and
there
was
*NL*
pressing
need
of
it
.
The
souls
of
these
two
men
were
troubled
even
when
*NL*
they
had
recovered
themselves
,
although
they
did
not
realize
it
,
*NL*
and
there
was
about
them
something
uncanny
,
which
was
the
sinister
*NL*
bewilderment
inspired
by
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
get
out
of
here
quickly
,
''
exclaimed
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumbled
in
his
pocket
,
and
pulled
out
a
gourd
with
which
he
had
*NL*
provided
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
first
,
take
a
drop
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flask
finished
what
the
fresh
air
had
begun
,
Jean
Valjean
swallowed
*NL*
a
mouthful
of
brandy
,
and
regained
full
possession
of
his
faculties
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
out
of
the
coffin
,
and
helped
Fauchelevent
to
nail
on
the
lid
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
minutes
later
they
were
out
of
the
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Fauchelevent
was
perfectly
composed
.
He
took
his
time
.
The
*NL*
cemetery
was
closed
.
The
arrival
of
the
grave-digger
Gribier
was
not
to
*NL*
be
apprehended
.
That
``
conscript
''
was
at
home
busily
engaged
in
looking
*NL*
for
his
card
,
and
at
some
difficulty
in
finding
it
in
his
lodgings
,
*NL*
since
it
was
in
Fauchelevent
's
pocket
.
Without
a
card
,
he
could
not
get
*NL*
back
into
the
cemetery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
took
the
shovel
,
and
Jean
Valjean
the
pick-axe
,
and
*NL*
together
they
buried
the
empty
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
grave
was
full
,
Fauchelevent
said
to
Jean
Valjean
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
go
.
I
will
keep
the
shovel
;
do
you
carry
off
the
mattock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
falling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
experienced
rome
difficulty
in
moving
and
in
walking
.
He
*NL*
had
stiffened
himself
in
that
coffin
,
and
had
become
a
little
like
a
*NL*
corpse
.
The
rigidity
of
death
had
seized
upon
him
between
those
four
*NL*
planks
.
He
had
,
in
a
manner
,
to
thaw
out
,
from
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
benumbed
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
.
``
It
is
a
pity
that
I
have
a
game
*NL*
leg
,
for
otherwise
we
might
step
out
briskly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
,
``
four
paces
will
put
life
into
my
legs
once
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
by
the
alleys
through
which
the
hearse
had
passed
.
On
*NL*
arriving
before
the
closed
gate
and
the
porter
's
pavilion
Fauchelevent
,
*NL*
who
held
the
grave-digger
's
card
in
his
hand
,
dropped
it
into
the
box
,
*NL*
the
porter
pulled
the
rope
,
the
gate
opened
,
and
they
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
everything
is
going
!
''
said
Fauchelevent
;
``
what
a
capital
idea
*NL*
that
was
of
yours
,
Father
Madeleine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
the
Vaugirard
barrier
in
the
simplest
manner
in
the
world
.
*NL*
In
the
neighborhood
of
the
cemetery
,
a
shovel
and
pick
are
equal
to
two
*NL*
passports
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rue
Vaugirard
was
deserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Madeleine
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
as
they
went
along
,
and
raising
*NL*
his
eyes
to
the
houses
,
``
Your
eyes
are
better
than
mine
.
Show
me
No.
*NL*
87
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
one
in
the
street
,
''
said
Fauchelevent
.
``
Give
me
your
*NL*
mattock
and
wait
a
couple
of
minutes
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
entered
No.
87
,
ascended
to
the
very
top
,
guided
by
the
*NL*
instinct
which
always
leads
the
poor
man
to
the
garret
,
and
knocked
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
at
the
door
of
an
attic
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
replied
:
``
Come
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Gribier
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
opened
the
door
.
The
grave-digger
's
dwelling
was
,
like
*NL*
all
such
wretched
habitations
,
an
unfurnished
and
encumbered
garret
.
*NL*
A
packing-case
--
a
coffin
,
perhaps
--
took
the
place
of
a
commode
,
a
*NL*
butter-pot
served
for
a
drinking-fountain
,
a
straw
mattress
served
for
*NL*
a
bed
,
the
floor
served
instead
of
tables
and
chairs
.
In
a
corner
,
on
a
*NL*
tattered
fragment
which
had
been
a
piece
of
an
old
carpet
,
a
thin
*NL*
woman
and
a
number
of
children
were
piled
in
a
heap
.
The
whole
of
this
*NL*
poverty-stricken
interior
bore
traces
of
having
been
overturned
.
One
*NL*
would
have
said
that
there
had
been
an
earthquake
``
for
one
.
''
The
covers
*NL*
were
displaced
,
the
rags
scattered
about
,
the
jug
broken
,
the
mother
had
*NL*
been
crying
,
the
children
had
probably
been
beaten
;
traces
of
a
vigorous
*NL*
and
ill-tempered
search
.
It
was
plain
that
the
grave-digger
had
made
*NL*
a
desperate
search
for
his
card
,
and
had
made
everybody
in
the
garret
,
*NL*
from
the
jug
to
his
wife
,
responsible
for
its
loss
.
He
wore
an
air
of
*NL*
desperation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fauchelevent
was
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
terminate
this
adventure
to
*NL*
take
any
notice
of
this
sad
side
of
his
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
brought
you
back
your
shovel
and
pick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gribier
gazed
at
him
in
stupefaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
,
peasant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to-morrow
morning
you
will
find
your
card
with
the
porter
of
the
*NL*
cemetery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
laid
the
shovel
and
mattock
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
demanded
Gribier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
meaning
of
it
is
,
that
you
dropped
your
card
out
of
your
pocket
,
*NL*
that
I
found
it
on
the
ground
after
you
were
gone
,
that
I
have
buried
*NL*
the
corpse
,
that
I
have
filled
the
grave
,
that
I
have
done
your
work
,
*NL*
that
the
porter
will
return
your
card
to
you
,
and
that
you
will
not
have
*NL*
to
pay
fifteen
francs
.
There
you
have
it
,
conscript
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
villager
!
''
exclaimed
Gribier
,
radiant
.
``
The
next
time
I
will
*NL*
pay
for
the
drinks
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
A
SUCCESSFUL
INTERROGATORY
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
,
in
the
darkness
of
night
,
two
men
and
a
child
presented
*NL*
themselves
at
No.
62
Rue
Petit-Picpus
.
The
elder
of
the
men
lifted
the
*NL*
knocker
and
rapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
Fauchelevent
,
Jean
Valjean
,
and
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
old
men
had
gone
to
fetch
Cosette
from
the
fruiterer
's
in
*NL*
the
Rue
du
Chemin-Vert
,
where
Fauchelevent
had
deposited
her
on
the
*NL*
preceding
day
.
Cosette
had
passed
these
twenty-four
hours
trembling
*NL*
silently
and
understanding
nothing
.
She
trembled
to
such
a
degree
that
*NL*
she
wept
.
She
had
neither
eaten
nor
slept
.
The
worthy
fruit-seller
had
*NL*
plied
her
with
a
hundred
questions
,
without
obtaining
any
other
reply
*NL*
than
a
melancholy
and
unvarying
gaze
.
Cosette
had
betrayed
nothing
of
*NL*
what
she
had
seen
and
heard
during
the
last
two
days
.
She
divined
that
*NL*
they
were
passing
through
a
crisis
.
She
was
deeply
conscious
that
it
was
*NL*
necessary
to
``
be
good
.
''
Who
has
not
experienced
the
sovereign
power
*NL*
of
those
two
words
,
pronounced
with
a
certain
accent
in
the
ear
of
a
*NL*
terrified
little
being
:
Say
nothing
!
Fear
is
mute
.
Moreover
,
no
one
*NL*
guards
a
secret
like
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
,
at
the
expiration
of
these
lugubrious
twenty-four
hours
,
she
*NL*
beheld
Jean
Valjean
again
,
she
gave
vent
to
such
a
cry
of
joy
,
that
any
*NL*
thoughtful
person
who
had
chanced
to
hear
that
cry
,
would
have
guessed
*NL*
that
it
issued
from
an
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
belonged
to
the
convent
and
knew
the
pass-words
.
All
the
*NL*
doors
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
was
solved
the
double
and
alarming
problem
of
how
to
get
out
and
*NL*
how
to
get
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
,
who
had
received
his
instructions
,
opened
the
little
*NL*
servant
's
door
which
connected
the
courtyard
with
the
garden
,
and
which
*NL*
could
still
be
seen
from
the
street
twenty
years
ago
,
in
the
wall
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
court
,
which
faced
the
carriage
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
admitted
all
three
of
them
through
this
door
,
and
from
that
*NL*
point
they
reached
the
inner
,
reserved
parlor
where
Fauchelevent
,
on
the
*NL*
preceding
day
,
had
received
his
orders
from
the
prioress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
,
rosary
in
hand
,
was
waiting
for
them
.
A
vocal
mother
,
with
*NL*
her
veil
lowered
,
stood
beside
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
discreet
candle
lighted
,
one
might
almost
say
,
made
a
show
of
lighting
*NL*
the
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
passed
Jean
Valjean
in
review
.
There
is
nothing
which
*NL*
examines
like
a
downcast
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
questioned
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
brother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
reverend
Mother
,
''
replied
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ultime
Fauchelevent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
really
had
had
a
brother
named
Ultime
,
who
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Picquigny
,
near
Amiens
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
age
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
profession
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gardener
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
good
Christian
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
one
is
in
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
your
little
girl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
reverend
Mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
her
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fauchelevent
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
grandfather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
vocal
mother
said
to
the
prioress
in
a
low
voice
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
answers
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
looked
attentively
at
Cosette
,
and
said
half
aloud
to
the
*NL*
vocal
mother
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
grow
up
ugly
.

*NL*
The
two
mothers
consulted
for
a
few
moments
in
very
low
tones
in
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
parlor
,
then
the
prioress
turned
round
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Fauvent
,
you
will
get
another
knee-cap
with
a
bell
.
Two
will
be
*NL*
required
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
therefore
,
two
bells
were
audible
in
the
garden
,
*NL*
and
the
nuns
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
raise
the
corner
of
*NL*
their
veils
.
At
the
extreme
end
of
the
garden
,
under
the
trees
,
two
*NL*
men
,
Fauvent
and
another
man
,
were
visible
as
they
dug
side
by
side
.
An
*NL*
enormous
event
.
Their
silence
was
broken
to
the
extent
of
saying
to
each
*NL*
other
:
``
He
is
an
assistant
gardener
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
vocal
mothers
added
:
``
He
is
a
brother
of
Father
Fauvent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
,
in
fact
,
regularly
installed
;
he
had
his
belled
*NL*
knee-cap
;
henceforth
he
was
official
.
His
name
was
Ultime
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
powerful
determining
cause
of
his
admission
had
been
the
*NL*
prioress
's
observation
upon
Cosette
:
``
She
will
grow
up
ugly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prioress
,
that
pronounced
prognosticator
,
immediately
took
a
fancy
*NL*
to
Cosette
and
gave
her
a
place
in
the
school
as
a
charity
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
that
is
not
strictly
logical
about
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
vain
that
mirrors
are
banished
from
the
convent
,
women
are
*NL*
conscious
of
their
faces
;
now
,
girls
who
are
conscious
of
their
beauty
*NL*
do
not
easily
become
nuns
;
the
vocation
being
voluntary
in
inverse
*NL*
proportion
to
their
good
looks
,
more
is
to
be
hoped
from
the
ugly
than
*NL*
from
the
pretty
.
Hence
a
lively
taste
for
plain
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
this
adventure
increased
the
importance
of
good
,
old
*NL*
Fauchelevent
;
he
won
a
triple
success
;
in
the
eyes
of
Jean
Valjean
,
whom
*NL*
he
had
saved
and
sheltered
;
in
those
of
grave-digger
Gribier
,
who
said
*NL*
to
himself
:
``
He
spared
me
that
fine
''
;
with
the
convent
,
which
,
being
*NL*
enabled
,
thanks
to
him
,
to
retain
the
coffin
of
Mother
Crucifixion
*NL*
under
the
altar
,
eluded
Caesar
and
satisfied
God
.
There
was
a
coffin
*NL*
containing
a
body
in
the
Petit-Picpus
,
and
a
coffin
without
a
body
in
*NL*
the
Vaugirard
cemetery
,
public
order
had
no
doubt
been
deeply
disturbed
*NL*
thereby
,
but
no
one
was
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
convent
,
its
gratitude
to
Fauchelevent
was
very
great
.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
became
the
best
of
servitors
and
the
most
precious
of
*NL*
gardeners
.
Upon
the
occasion
of
the
archbishop
's
next
visit
,
the
*NL*
prioress
recounted
the
affair
to
his
Grace
,
making
something
of
a
*NL*
confession
at
the
same
time
,
and
yet
boasting
of
her
deed
.
On
leaving
*NL*
the
convent
,
the
archbishop
mentioned
it
with
approval
,
and
in
a
whisper
*NL*
to
M.
de
Latil
,
Monsieur
's
confessor
,
afterwards
Archbishop
of
Reims
*NL*
and
Cardinal
.
This
admiration
for
Fauchelevent
became
widespread
,
for
it
*NL*
made
its
way
to
Rome
.
We
have
seen
a
note
addressed
by
the
then
reigning
*NL*
Pope
,
Leo
XII.
,
to
one
of
his
relatives
,
a
Monsignor
in
the
Nuncio
's
*NL*
establishment
in
Paris
,
and
bearing
,
like
himself
,
the
name
of
Della
*NL*
Genga
;
it
contained
these
lines
:
``
It
appears
that
there
is
in
a
convent
*NL*
in
Paris
an
excellent
gardener
,
who
is
also
a
holy
man
,
named
Fauvent
.
''
*NL*
Nothing
of
this
triumph
reached
Fauchelevent
in
his
hut
;
he
went
on
*NL*
grafting
,
weeding
,
and
covering
up
his
melon
beds
,
without
in
the
least
*NL*
suspecting
his
excellences
and
his
sanctity
.
Neither
did
he
suspect
his
*NL*
glory
,
any
more
than
a
Durham
or
Surrey
bull
whose
portrait
is
published
*NL*
in
the
London
Illustrated
News
,
with
this
inscription
:
``
Bull
which
*NL*
carried
off
the
prize
at
the
Cattle
Show
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
CLOISTERED
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
continued
to
hold
her
tongue
in
the
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
natural
that
Cosette
should
think
herself
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
daughter
.
Moreover
,
as
she
knew
nothing
,
she
could
say
nothing
,
and
*NL*
then
,
she
would
not
have
said
anything
in
any
case
.
As
we
have
just
*NL*
observed
,
nothing
trains
children
to
silence
like
unhappiness
.
Cosette
*NL*
had
suffered
so
much
,
that
she
feared
everything
,
even
to
speak
or
to
*NL*
breathe
.
A
single
word
had
so
often
brought
down
an
avalanche
upon
her
.
*NL*
She
had
hardly
begun
to
regain
her
confidence
since
she
had
been
with
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
She
speedily
became
accustomed
to
the
convent
.
Only
she
*NL*
regretted
Catherine
,
but
she
dared
not
say
so
.
Once
,
however
,
she
did
*NL*
say
to
Jean
Valjean
:
``
Father
,
if
I
had
known
,
I
would
have
brought
her
*NL*
away
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
been
obliged
,
on
becoming
a
scholar
in
the
convent
,
to
don
*NL*
the
garb
of
the
pupils
of
the
house
.
Jean
Valjean
succeeded
in
getting
*NL*
them
to
restore
to
him
the
garments
which
she
laid
aside
.
This
was
the
*NL*
same
mourning
suit
which
he
had
made
her
put
on
when
she
had
quitted
*NL*
the
Thenardiers
'
inn
.
It
was
not
very
threadbare
even
now
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
locked
up
these
garments
,
plus
the
stockings
and
the
shoes
,
with
a
*NL*
quantity
of
camphor
and
all
the
aromatics
in
which
convents
abound
,
in
a
*NL*
little
valise
which
he
found
means
of
procuring
.
He
set
this
valise
on
*NL*
a
chair
near
his
bed
,
and
he
always
carried
the
key
about
his
person
.
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
Cosette
asked
him
one
day
,
``
what
is
there
in
that
box
which
*NL*
smells
so
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Fauchelevent
received
other
recompense
for
his
good
action
,
in
*NL*
addition
to
the
glory
which
we
just
mentioned
,
and
of
which
he
knew
*NL*
nothing
;
in
the
first
place
it
made
him
happy
;
next
,
he
had
much
less
*NL*
work
,
since
it
was
shared
.
Lastly
,
as
he
was
very
fond
of
snuff
,
he
*NL*
found
the
presence
of
M.
Madeleine
an
advantage
,
in
that
he
used
three
*NL*
times
as
much
as
he
had
done
previously
,
and
that
in
an
infinitely
more
*NL*
luxurious
manner
,
seeing
that
M.
Madeleine
paid
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nuns
did
not
adopt
the
name
of
Ultime
;
they
called
Jean
Valjean
the
*NL*
other
Fauvent
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
these
holy
women
had
possessed
anything
of
Javert
's
glance
,
they
*NL*
would
eventually
have
noticed
that
when
there
was
any
errand
to
be
*NL*
done
outside
in
the
behalf
of
the
garden
,
it
was
always
the
elder
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
the
old
,
the
infirm
,
the
lame
man
,
who
went
,
and
never
the
*NL*
other
;
but
whether
it
is
that
eyes
constantly
fixed
on
God
know
not
how
*NL*
to
spy
,
or
whether
they
were
,
by
preference
,
occupied
in
keeping
watch
*NL*
on
each
other
,
they
paid
no
heed
to
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
it
was
well
for
Jean
Valjean
that
he
kept
close
and
did
not
*NL*
stir
out
.
Javert
watched
the
quarter
for
more
than
a
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
convent
was
for
Jean
Valjean
like
an
island
surrounded
by
gulfs
.
*NL*
Henceforth
,
those
four
walls
constituted
his
world
.
He
saw
enough
of
the
*NL*
sky
there
to
enable
him
to
preserve
his
serenity
,
and
Cosette
enough
to
*NL*
remain
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
sweet
life
began
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inhabited
the
old
hut
at
the
end
of
the
garden
,
in
company
with
*NL*
Fauchelevent
.
This
hovel
,
built
of
old
rubbish
,
which
was
still
in
*NL*
existence
in
1845
,
was
composed
,
as
the
reader
already
knows
,
of
three
*NL*
chambers
,
all
of
which
were
utterly
bare
and
had
nothing
beyond
the
*NL*
walls
.
The
principal
one
had
been
given
up
,
by
force
,
for
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
had
opposed
it
in
vain
,
to
M.
Madeleine
,
by
Father
Fauchelevent
.
The
*NL*
walls
of
this
chamber
had
for
ornament
,
in
addition
to
the
two
nails
*NL*
whereon
to
hang
the
knee-cap
and
the
basket
,
a
Royalist
bank-note
*NL*
of
'
93
,
applied
to
the
wall
over
the
chimney-piece
,
and
of
which
the
*NL*
following
is
an
exact
facsimile

This
specimen
of
Vendean
paper
money
had
been
nailed
to
the
wall
by
*NL*
the
preceding
gardener
,
an
old
Chouan
,
who
had
died
in
the
convent
,
and
*NL*
whose
place
Fauchelevent
had
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
worked
in
the
garden
every
day
and
made
himself
very
*NL*
useful
.
He
had
formerly
been
a
pruner
of
trees
,
and
he
gladly
found
*NL*
himself
a
gardener
once
more
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
he
knew
all
*NL*
sorts
of
secrets
and
receipts
for
agriculture
.
He
turned
these
to
*NL*
advantage
.
Almost
all
the
trees
in
the
orchard
were
ungrafted
,
and
wild
.
*NL*
He
budded
them
and
made
them
produce
excellent
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
permission
to
pass
an
hour
with
him
every
day
.
As
the
*NL*
sisters
were
melancholy
and
he
was
kind
,
the
child
made
comparisons
and
*NL*
adored
him
.
At
the
appointed
hour
she
flew
to
the
hut
.
When
she
entered
*NL*
the
lowly
cabin
,
she
filled
it
with
paradise
.
Jean
Valjean
blossomed
*NL*
out
and
felt
his
happiness
increase
with
the
happiness
which
he
afforded
*NL*
Cosette
.
The
joy
which
we
inspire
has
this
charming
property
,
that
,
far
*NL*
from
growing
meagre
,
like
all
reflections
,
it
returns
to
us
more
radiant
*NL*
than
ever
.
At
recreation
hours
,
Jean
Valjean
watched
her
running
and
*NL*
playing
in
the
distance
,
and
he
distinguished
her
laugh
from
that
of
the
*NL*
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Cosette
laughed
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
's
face
had
even
undergone
a
change
,
to
a
certain
extent
.
The
*NL*
gloom
had
disappeared
from
it
.
A
smile
is
the
same
as
sunshine
;
it
*NL*
banishes
winter
from
the
human
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Recreation
over
,
when
Cosette
went
into
the
house
again
,
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
gazed
at
the
windows
of
her
class-room
,
and
at
night
he
rose
to
look
at
*NL*
the
windows
of
her
dormitory
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
has
his
own
ways
,
moreover
;
the
convent
contributed
,
like
Cosette
,
*NL*
to
uphold
and
complete
the
Bishop
's
work
in
Jean
Valjean
.
It
is
certain
*NL*
that
virtue
adjoins
pride
on
one
side
.
A
bridge
built
by
the
devil
*NL*
exists
there
.
Jean
Valjean
had
been
,
unconsciously
,
perhaps
,
tolerably
*NL*
near
that
side
and
that
bridge
,
when
Providence
cast
his
lot
in
the
*NL*
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus
;
so
long
as
he
had
compared
himself
only
to
*NL*
the
Bishop
,
he
had
regarded
himself
as
unworthy
and
had
remained
humble
;
*NL*
but
for
some
time
past
he
had
been
comparing
himself
to
men
in
general
,
*NL*
and
pride
was
beginning
to
spring
up
.
Who
knows
?
He
might
have
ended
by
*NL*
returning
very
gradually
to
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
convent
stopped
him
on
that
downward
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
second
place
of
captivity
which
he
had
seen
.
In
his
youth
,
*NL*
in
what
had
been
for
him
the
beginning
of
his
life
,
and
later
on
,
quite
*NL*
recently
again
,
he
had
beheld
another
,
--
a
frightful
place
,
a
terrible
*NL*
place
,
whose
severities
had
always
appeared
to
him
the
iniquity
of
*NL*
justice
,
and
the
crime
of
the
law
.
Now
,
after
the
galleys
,
he
saw
the
*NL*
cloister
;
and
when
he
meditated
how
he
had
formed
a
part
of
the
galleys
,
*NL*
and
that
he
now
,
so
to
speak
,
was
a
spectator
of
the
cloister
,
he
*NL*
confronted
the
two
in
his
own
mind
with
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
he
crossed
his
arms
and
leaned
on
his
hoe
,
and
slowly
*NL*
descended
the
endless
spirals
of
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recalled
his
former
companions
:
how
wretched
they
were
;
they
rose
at
*NL*
dawn
,
and
toiled
until
night
;
hardly
were
they
permitted
to
sleep
;
they
*NL*
lay
on
camp
beds
,
where
nothing
was
tolerated
but
mattresses
two
inches
*NL*
thick
,
in
rooms
which
were
heated
only
in
the
very
harshest
months
of
*NL*
the
year
;
they
were
clothed
in
frightful
red
blouses
;
they
were
allowed
,
*NL*
as
a
great
favor
,
linen
trousers
in
the
hottest
weather
,
and
a
woollen
*NL*
carter
's
blouse
on
their
backs
when
it
was
very
cold
;
they
drank
no
*NL*
wine
,
and
ate
no
meat
,
except
when
they
went
on
``
fatigue
duty
.
''
They
*NL*
lived
nameless
,
designated
only
by
numbers
,
and
converted
,
after
a
*NL*
manner
,
into
ciphers
themselves
,
with
downcast
eyes
,
with
lowered
*NL*
voices
,
with
shorn
heads
,
beneath
the
cudgel
and
in
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
mind
reverted
to
the
beings
whom
he
had
under
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
beings
also
lived
with
shorn
heads
,
with
downcast
eyes
,
with
*NL*
lowered
voices
,
not
in
disgrace
,
but
amid
the
scoffs
of
the
world
,
*NL*
not
with
their
backs
bruised
with
the
cudgel
,
but
with
their
shoulders
*NL*
lacerated
with
their
discipline
.
Their
names
,
also
,
had
vanished
from
*NL*
among
men
;
they
no
longer
existed
except
under
austere
appellations
.
*NL*
They
never
ate
meat
and
they
never
drank
wine
;
they
often
remained
until
*NL*
evening
without
food
;
they
were
attired
,
not
in
a
red
blouse
,
but
in
a
*NL*
black
shroud
,
of
woollen
,
which
was
heavy
in
summer
and
thin
in
winter
,
*NL*
without
the
power
to
add
or
subtract
anything
from
it
;
without
having
*NL*
even
,
according
to
the
season
,
the
resource
of
the
linen
garment
or
the
*NL*
woollen
cloak
;
and
for
six
months
in
the
year
they
wore
serge
chemises
*NL*
which
gave
them
fever
.
They
dwelt
,
not
in
rooms
warmed
only
during
*NL*
rigorous
cold
,
but
in
cells
where
no
fire
was
ever
lighted
;
they
slept
,
*NL*
not
on
mattresses
two
inches
thick
,
but
on
straw
.
And
finally
,
they
were
*NL*
not
even
allowed
their
sleep
;
every
night
,
after
a
day
of
toil
,
they
*NL*
were
obliged
,
in
the
weariness
of
their
first
slumber
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
they
were
falling
sound
asleep
and
beginning
to
get
warm
,
to
rouse
*NL*
themselves
,
to
rise
and
to
go
and
pray
in
an
ice-cold
and
gloomy
chapel
,
*NL*
with
their
knees
on
the
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
certain
days
each
of
these
beings
in
turn
had
to
remain
for
twelve
*NL*
successive
hours
in
a
kneeling
posture
,
or
prostrate
,
with
face
upon
the
*NL*
pavement
,
and
arms
outstretched
in
the
form
of
a
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
were
men
;
these
were
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
those
men
done
?
They
had
stolen
,
violated
,
pillaged
,
*NL*
murdered
,
assassinated
.
They
were
bandits
,
counterfeiters
,
poisoners
,
*NL*
incendiaries
,
murderers
,
parricides
.
What
had
these
women
done
?
They
had
*NL*
done
nothing
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
one
hand
,
highway
robbery
,
fraud
,
deceit
,
violence
,
sensuality
,
*NL*
homicide
,
all
sorts
of
sacrilege
,
every
variety
of
crime
;
on
the
other
,
*NL*
one
thing
only
,
innocence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perfect
innocence
,
almost
caught
up
into
heaven
in
a
mysterious
*NL*
assumption
,
attached
to
the
earth
by
virtue
,
already
possessing
*NL*
something
of
heaven
through
holiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
one
hand
,
confidences
over
crimes
,
which
are
exchanged
in
*NL*
whispers
;
on
the
other
,
the
confession
of
faults
made
aloud
.
And
what
*NL*
crimes
!
And
what
faults
!
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
one
hand
,
miasms
;
on
the
other
,
an
ineffable
perfume
.
On
the
one
*NL*
hand
,
a
moral
pest
,
guarded
from
sight
,
penned
up
under
the
range
of
*NL*
cannon
,
and
literally
devouring
its
plague-stricken
victims
;
on
*NL*
the
other
,
the
chaste
flame
of
all
souls
on
the
same
hearth
.
There
,
*NL*
darkness
;
here
,
the
shadow
;
but
a
shadow
filled
with
gleams
of
light
,
*NL*
and
of
gleams
full
of
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
strongholds
of
slavery
;
but
in
the
first
,
deliverance
possible
,
*NL*
a
legal
limit
always
in
sight
,
and
then
,
escape
.
In
the
second
,
*NL*
perpetuity
;
the
sole
hope
,
at
the
distant
extremity
of
the
future
,
that
*NL*
faint
light
of
liberty
which
men
call
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
,
men
are
bound
only
with
chains
;
in
the
other
,
chained
by
*NL*
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
flowed
from
the
first
?
An
immense
curse
,
the
gnashing
of
teeth
,
*NL*
hatred
,
desperate
viciousness
,
a
cry
of
rage
against
human
society
,
a
*NL*
sarcasm
against
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
results
flowed
from
the
second
?
Blessings
and
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
these
two
places
,
so
similar
yet
so
unlike
,
these
two
species
*NL*
of
beings
who
were
so
very
unlike
,
were
undergoing
the
same
work
,
*NL*
expiation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
understood
thoroughly
the
expiation
of
the
former
;
that
*NL*
personal
expiation
,
the
expiation
for
one
's
self
.
But
he
did
not
*NL*
understand
that
of
these
last
,
that
of
creatures
without
reproach
and
*NL*
without
stain
,
and
he
trembled
as
he
asked
himself
:
The
expiation
of
*NL*
what
?
What
expiation
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
within
his
conscience
replied
:
``
The
most
divine
of
human
*NL*
generosities
,
the
expiation
for
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
all
personal
theory
is
withheld
;
we
are
only
the
narrator
;
we
*NL*
place
ourselves
at
Jean
Valjean
's
point
of
view
,
and
we
translate
his
*NL*
impressions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
his
eyes
he
had
the
sublime
summit
of
abnegation
,
the
highest
*NL*
possible
pitch
of
virtue
;
the
innocence
which
pardons
men
their
faults
,
*NL*
and
which
expiates
in
their
stead
;
servitude
submitted
to
,
torture
*NL*
accepted
,
punishment
claimed
by
souls
which
have
not
sinned
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
sparing
it
to
souls
which
have
fallen
;
the
love
of
humanity
*NL*
swallowed
up
in
the
love
of
God
,
but
even
there
preserving
its
distinct
*NL*
and
mediatorial
character
;
sweet
and
feeble
beings
possessing
the
misery
*NL*
of
those
who
are
punished
and
the
smile
of
those
who
are
recompensed
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
remembered
that
he
had
dared
to
murmur
!
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
in
the
middle
of
the
night
,
he
rose
to
listen
to
the
grateful
*NL*
song
of
those
innocent
creatures
weighed
down
with
severities
,
and
the
*NL*
blood
ran
cold
in
his
veins
at
the
thought
that
those
who
were
justly
*NL*
chastised
raised
their
voices
heavenward
only
in
blasphemy
,
and
that
he
,
*NL*
wretch
that
he
was
,
had
shaken
his
fist
at
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
striking
thing
which
caused
him
to
meditate
deeply
,
like
*NL*
a
warning
whisper
from
Providence
itself
:
the
scaling
of
that
wall
,
the
*NL*
passing
of
those
barriers
,
the
adventure
accepted
even
at
the
risk
of
*NL*
death
,
the
painful
and
difficult
ascent
,
all
those
efforts
even
,
which
*NL*
he
had
made
to
escape
from
that
other
place
of
expiation
,
he
had
made
in
*NL*
order
to
gain
entrance
into
this
one
.
Was
this
a
symbol
of
his
destiny
?
*NL*
This
house
was
a
prison
likewise
and
bore
a
melancholy
resemblance
to
*NL*
that
other
one
whence
he
had
fled
,
and
yet
he
had
never
conceived
an
*NL*
idea
of
anything
similar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
beheld
gratings
,
bolts
,
iron
bars
--
to
guard
whom
?
Angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
lofty
walls
which
he
had
seen
around
tigers
,
he
now
beheld
once
*NL*
more
around
lambs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
place
of
expiation
,
and
not
of
punishment
;
and
yet
,
it
was
*NL*
still
more
austere
,
more
gloomy
,
and
more
pitiless
than
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
virgins
were
even
more
heavily
burdened
than
the
convicts
.
A
cold
,
*NL*
harsh
wind
,
that
wind
which
had
chilled
his
youth
,
traversed
the
barred
*NL*
and
padlocked
grating
of
the
vultures
;
a
still
harsher
and
more
biting
*NL*
breeze
blew
in
the
cage
of
these
doves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
thought
on
these
things
,
all
that
was
within
him
was
lost
in
*NL*
amazement
before
this
mystery
of
sublimity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
these
meditations
,
his
pride
vanished
.
He
scrutinized
his
own
heart
*NL*
in
all
manner
of
ways
;
he
felt
his
pettiness
,
and
many
a
time
he
wept
.
*NL*
All
that
had
entered
into
his
life
for
the
last
six
months
had
led
him
*NL*
back
towards
the
Bishop
's
holy
injunctions
;
Cosette
through
love
,
the
*NL*
convent
through
humility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
at
eventide
,
in
the
twilight
,
at
an
hour
when
the
garden
was
*NL*
deserted
,
he
could
be
seen
on
his
knees
in
the
middle
of
the
walk
which
*NL*
skirted
the
chapel
,
in
front
of
the
window
through
which
he
had
gazed
on
*NL*
the
night
of
his
arrival
,
and
turned
towards
the
spot
where
,
as
he
knew
,
*NL*
the
sister
was
making
reparation
,
prostrated
in
prayer
.
Thus
he
prayed
*NL*
as
he
knelt
before
the
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
though
he
dared
not
kneel
directly
before
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
that
surrounded
him
,
that
peaceful
garden
,
those
fragrant
*NL*
flowers
,
those
children
who
uttered
joyous
cries
,
those
grave
and
simple
*NL*
women
,
that
silent
cloister
,
slowly
permeated
him
,
and
little
by
little
,
*NL*
his
soul
became
compounded
of
silence
like
the
cloister
,
of
perfume
like
*NL*
the
flowers
,
of
simplicity
like
the
women
,
of
joy
like
the
children
.
*NL*
And
then
he
reflected
that
these
had
been
two
houses
of
God
which
had
*NL*
received
him
in
succession
at
two
critical
moments
in
his
life
:
the
*NL*
first
,
when
all
doors
were
closed
and
when
human
society
rejected
him
;
*NL*
the
second
,
at
a
moment
when
human
society
had
again
set
out
in
pursuit
*NL*
of
him
,
and
when
the
galleys
were
again
yawning
;
and
that
,
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
the
first
,
he
should
have
relapsed
into
crime
,
and
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
the
second
,
into
torment
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
whole
heart
melted
in
gratitude
,
and
he
loved
more
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
years
passed
in
this
manner
;
Cosette
was
growing
up
.

CHAPTER

--
PARVULUS
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
has
a
child
,
and
the
forest
has
a
bird
;
the
bird
is
called
the
*NL*
sparrow
;
the
child
is
called
the
gamin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Couple
these
two
ideas
which
contain
,
the
one
all
the
furnace
,
the
other
*NL*
all
the
dawn
;
strike
these
two
sparks
together
,
Paris
,
childhood
;
there
*NL*
leaps
out
from
them
a
little
being
.
Homuncio
,
Plautus
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
being
is
joyous
.
He
has
not
food
every
day
,
and
he
goes
to
*NL*
the
play
every
evening
,
if
he
sees
good
.
He
has
no
shirt
on
his
body
,
*NL*
no
shoes
on
his
feet
,
no
roof
over
his
head
;
he
is
like
the
flies
of
*NL*
heaven
,
who
have
none
of
these
things
.
He
is
from
seven
to
thirteen
*NL*
years
of
age
,
he
lives
in
bands
,
roams
the
streets
,
lodges
in
the
open
*NL*
air
,
wears
an
old
pair
of
trousers
of
his
father
's
,
which
descend
below
*NL*
his
heels
,
an
old
hat
of
some
other
father
,
which
descends
below
his
*NL*
ears
,
a
single
suspender
of
yellow
listing
;
he
runs
,
lies
in
wait
,
*NL*
rummages
about
,
wastes
time
,
blackens
pipes
,
swears
like
a
convict
,
*NL*
haunts
the
wine-shop
,
knows
thieves
,
calls
gay
women
thou
,
talks
slang
,
*NL*
sings
obscene
songs
,
and
has
no
evil
in
his
heart
.
This
is
because
he
*NL*
has
in
his
heart
a
pearl
,
innocence
;
and
pearls
are
not
to
be
dissolved
*NL*
in
mud
.
So
long
as
man
is
in
his
childhood
,
God
wills
that
he
shall
be
*NL*
innocent
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
one
were
to
ask
that
enormous
city
:
``
What
is
this
?
''
she
would
reply
:
*NL*
``
It
is
my
little
one

CHAPTER
II
--
SOME
OF
HIS
PARTICULAR
CHARACTERISTICS
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
--
the
street
Arab
--
of
Paris
is
the
dwarf
of
the
giant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
not
exaggerate
,
this
cherub
of
the
gutter
sometimes
has
a
shirt
,
*NL*
but
,
in
that
case
,
he
owns
but
one
;
he
sometimes
has
shoes
,
but
then
*NL*
they
have
no
soles
;
he
sometimes
has
a
lodging
,
and
he
loves
it
,
for
*NL*
he
finds
his
mother
there
;
but
he
prefers
the
street
,
because
there
he
*NL*
finds
liberty
.
He
has
his
own
games
,
his
own
bits
of
mischief
,
whose
*NL*
foundation
consists
of
hatred
for
the
bourgeois
;
his
peculiar
metaphors
:
*NL*
to
be
dead
is
to
eat
dandelions
by
the
root
;
his
own
occupations
,
*NL*
calling
hackney-coaches
,
letting
down
carriage-steps
,
establishing
means
*NL*
of
transit
between
the
two
sides
of
a
street
in
heavy
rains
,
which
he
*NL*
calls
making
the
bridge
of
arts
,
crying
discourses
pronounced
by
the
*NL*
authorities
in
favor
of
the
French
people
,
cleaning
out
the
cracks
*NL*
in
the
pavement
;
he
has
his
own
coinage
,
which
is
composed
of
all
the
*NL*
little
morsels
of
worked
copper
which
are
found
on
the
public
streets
.
*NL*
This
curious
money
,
which
receives
the
name
of
loques
--
rags
--
has
*NL*
an
invariable
and
well-regulated
currency
in
this
little
Bohemia
of
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lastly
,
he
has
his
own
fauna
,
which
he
observes
attentively
in
*NL*
the
corners
;
the
lady-bird
,
the
death
's
-
head
plant-louse
,
the
*NL*
daddy-long-legs
,
``
the
devil
,
''
a
black
insect
,
which
menaces
by
twisting
*NL*
about
its
tail
armed
with
two
horns
.
He
has
his
fabulous
monster
,
which
*NL*
has
scales
under
its
belly
,
but
is
not
a
lizard
,
which
has
pustules
on
*NL*
its
back
,
but
is
not
a
toad
,
which
inhabits
the
nooks
of
old
lime-kilns
*NL*
and
wells
that
have
run
dry
,
which
is
black
,
hairy
,
sticky
,
which
crawls
*NL*
sometimes
slowly
,
sometimes
rapidly
,
which
has
no
cry
,
but
which
has
a
*NL*
look
,
and
is
so
terrible
that
no
one
has
ever
beheld
it
;
he
calls
this
*NL*
monster
``
the
deaf
thing
.
''
The
search
for
these
``
deaf
things
''
among
*NL*
the
stones
is
a
joy
of
formidable
nature
.
Another
pleasure
consists
in
*NL*
suddenly
prying
up
a
paving-stone
,
and
taking
a
look
at
the
wood-lice
.
*NL*
Each
region
of
Paris
is
celebrated
for
the
interesting
treasures
which
*NL*
are

There
are
ear-wigs
in
the
timber-yards
of
the
*NL*
Ursulines
,
there
are
millepeds
in
the
Pantheon
,
there
are
tadpoles

the

of
the
Champs-de-Mars

*NL*
As
far
as
sayings
are
concerned
,
this
child
has
as
many
of
them
as
*NL*
Talleyrand
.
He
is
no
less
cynical
,
but
he
is
more
honest
.
He
is
endowed
*NL*
with
a
certain
indescribable
,
unexpected
joviality
;
he
upsets
the
*NL*
composure
of
the
shopkeeper
with
his
wild
laughter
.
He
ranges
boldly
*NL*
from
high
comedy
to
farce
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
funeral
passes
by
.
Among
those
who
accompany
the
dead
there
is
a
*NL*
doctor
.
``
Hey
there
!
''
shouts
some
street
Arab
,
``
how
long
has
it
been
*NL*
customary
for
doctors
to
carry
home
their
own
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
is
in
a
crowd
.
A
grave
man
,
adorned
with
spectacles
and
*NL*
trinkets
,
turns
round
indignantly
:
``
You
good-for-nothing
,
you
have
*NL*
seized
my
wife
's
waist

``

CHAPTER
III
--
HE
IS
AGREEABLE
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
thanks
to
a
few
sous
,
which
he
always
finds
means
*NL*
to
procure
,
the
homuncio
enters
a
theatre
.
On
crossing
that
magic
*NL*
threshold
,
he
becomes
transfigured
;
he
was
the
street
Arab
,
he
becomes
*NL*
the
titi
.
-LSB-
18
-RSB-
Theatres
are
a
sort
of
ship
turned
upside
down
with
the
*NL*
keel
in
the
air
.
It
is
in
that
keel
that
the
titi
huddle
together
.
*NL*
The
titi
is
to
the
gamin
what
the
moth
is
to
the
larva
;
the
same
being
*NL*
endowed
with
wings
and
soaring
.
It
suffices
for
him
to
be
there
,
with
*NL*
his
radiance
of
happiness
,
with
his
power
of
enthusiasm
and
joy
,
with
*NL*
his
hand-clapping
,
which
resembles
a
clapping
of
wings
,
to
confer
on
*NL*
that
narrow
,
dark
,
fetid
,
sordid
,
unhealthy
,
hideous
,
abominable
keel
,
*NL*
the
name
of
Paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bestow
on
an
individual
the
useless
and
deprive
him
of
the
necessary
,
*NL*
and
you
have
the
gamin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
is
not
devoid
of
literary
intuition
.
His
tendency
,
and
we
say
*NL*
it
with
the
proper
amount
of
regret
,
would
not
constitute
classic
*NL*
taste
.
He
is
not
very
academic
by
nature
.
Thus
,
to
give
an
example
,
the
*NL*
popularity
of
Mademoiselle
Mars
among
that
little
audience
of
stormy
*NL*
children
was
seasoned
with
a
touch
of
irony
.
The
gamin
called
her
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Muche
--
``
hide
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
bawls
and
scoffs
and
ridicules
and
fights
,
has
rags
like
a
*NL*
baby
and
tatters
like
a
philosopher
,
fishes
in
the
sewer
,
hunts
in
the
*NL*
cesspool
,
extracts
mirth
from
foulness
,
whips
up
the
squares
with
his
*NL*
wit
,
grins
and
bites
,
whistles
and
sings
,
shouts
,
and
shrieks
,
tempers
*NL*
Alleluia
with
Matantur-lurette
,
chants
every
rhythm
from
the
De
*NL*
Profundis
to
the
Jack-pudding
,
finds
without
seeking
,
knows
what
he
is
*NL*
ignorant
of
,
is
a
Spartan
to
the
point
of
thieving
,
is
mad
to
wisdom
,
is
*NL*
lyrical
to
filth
,
would
crouch
down
on
Olympus
,
wallows
in
the
dunghill
*NL*
and
emerges
from
it
covered
with
stars
.
The
gamin
of
Paris
is
Rabelais
*NL*
in
this
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
not
content
with
his
trousers
unless
they
have
a
watch-pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
is
not
easily
astonished
,
he
is
still
less
easily
terrified
,
he
makes
*NL*
songs
on
superstitions
,
he
takes
the
wind
out
of
exaggerations
,
he
twits
*NL*
mysteries
,
he
thrusts
out
his
tongue
at
ghosts
,
he
takes
the
poetry
out
*NL*
of
stilted
things
,
he
introduces
caricature
into
epic
extravaganzas
.
*NL*
It
is
not
that
he
is
prosaic
;
far
from
that
;
but
he
replaces
the
solemn
*NL*
vision
by
the
farcical
phantasmagoria
.
If
Adamastor
were
to
appear
to
*NL*
him
,
the
street
Arab
would
say
:
``
Hi
there
!
The
bugaboo
!

HE

BE
OF
USE
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
begins
with
the
lounger
and
ends
with
the
street
Arab
,
two
*NL*
beings
of
which
no
other
city
is
capable
;
the
passive
acceptance
,
which
*NL*
contents
itself
with
gazing
,
and
the
inexhaustible
initiative
;
Prudhomme
*NL*
and
Fouillou
.
Paris
alone
has
this
in
its
natural
history
.
The
whole
of
*NL*
the
monarchy
is
contained
in
the
lounger
;
the
whole
of
anarchy
in
the
*NL*
gamin
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pale
child
of
the
Parisian
faubourgs
lives
and
develops
,
makes
*NL*
connections
,
``
grows
supple
''
in
suffering
,
in
the
presence
of
social
*NL*
realities
and
of
human
things
,
a
thoughtful
witness
.
He
thinks
himself
*NL*
heedless
;
and
he
is
not
.
He
looks
and
is
on
the
verge
of
laughter
;
he
is
*NL*
on
the
verge
of
something
else
also
.
Whoever
you
may
be

if
your
name
is
*NL*
Prejudice
,
Abuse
,
Ignorance
,
Oppression
,
Iniquity
,
Despotism

Injustice
,

Fanaticism
,
Tyranny
,
beware
of
the
gaping
gamin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fellow
will
grow
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
what
clay
is
he
made
?
Of
the
first
mud
that
comes
to
hand
.
A
handful
*NL*
of
dirt
,
a
breath
,
and
behold
Adam
.
It
suffices
for
a
God
to
pass
by
.
A
*NL*
God
has
always
passed
over
the
street
Arab
.
Fortune
labors
at
this
tiny
*NL*
being
.
By
the
word
``
fortune
''
we
mean
chance
,
to
some
extent
.
That
pigmy
*NL*
kneaded
out
of
common
earth
,
ignorant
,
unlettered
,
giddy
,
vulgar
,
low
.
*NL*
Will
that
become
an
Ionian
or
a
Boeotian
?
Wait

currit

,
the
Spirit
*NL*
of
Paris
,
that
demon
which
creates
the
children
of
chance
and
the
men
*NL*
of
destiny
,
reversing
the
process
of
the
Latin

,
makes
of

an

CHAPTER
V
--
HIS
FRONTIERS
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
loves
the
city
,
he
also
loves
solitude
,
since
he
has
something
*NL*
of
the
sage
in
him
.
Urbis
amator
,
like
Fuscus
;
ruris
amator
,
like
*NL*
Flaccus
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
roam
thoughtfully
about
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
lounge
,
is
a
fine
*NL*
employment
of
time
in
the
eyes
of
the
philosopher
;
particularly
in
that
*NL*
rather
illegitimate
species
of
campaign
,
which
is
tolerably
ugly
but
*NL*
odd
and
composed
of
two
natures
,
which
surrounds
certain
great
cities
,
*NL*
notably
Paris
.
To
study
the
suburbs
is
to
study
the
amphibious
animal
.
*NL*
End
of
the
trees
,
beginning
of
the
roofs
;
end
of
the
grass
,
beginning
*NL*
of
the
pavements
;
end
of
the
furrows
,
beginning
of
the
shops
,
end
of
*NL*
the
wheel-ruts
,
beginning
of
the
passions
;
end
of
the
divine
murmur
,
*NL*
beginning
of
the
human
uproar
;
hence
an
extraordinary
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
in
these
not
very
attractive
places
,
indelibly
stamped
by
the
*NL*
passing
stroller
with
the
epithet
:
melancholy
,
the
apparently
objectless
*NL*
promenades
of
the
dreamer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
writes
these
lines
has
long
been
a
prowler
about
the
barriers
*NL*
of
Paris
,
and
it
is
for
him
a
source
of
profound
souvenirs
.
That
*NL*
close-shaven
turf
,
those
pebbly
paths
,
that
chalk
,
those
pools
,
*NL*
those
harsh
monotonies
of
waste
and
fallow
lands
,
the
plants
of
early
*NL*
market-garden
suddenly
springing
into
sight
in
a
bottom
,
that
mixture
of
*NL*
the
savage
and
the
citizen
,
those
vast
desert
nooks
where
the
garrison
*NL*
drums
practise
noisily
,
and
produce
a
sort
of
lisping
of
battle
,
those
*NL*
hermits
by
day
and
cut-throats
by
night
,
that
clumsy
mill
which
turns
*NL*
in
the
wind
,
the
hoisting-wheels
of
the
quarries
,
the
tea-gardens
at
the
*NL*
corners
of
the
cemeteries
;
the
mysterious
charm
of
great
,
sombre
walls
*NL*
squarely
intersecting
immense
,
vague
stretches
of
land
inundated
with
*NL*
sunshine
and
full
of
butterflies
,
--
all
this
attracted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
hardly
any
one
on
earth
who
is
not
acquainted
with
those
*NL*
singular
spots
,
the
Glaciere
,
the
Cunette
,
the
hideous
wall
of
Grenelle
*NL*
all
speckled
with
balls
,
Mont-Parnasse
,
the
Fosse-aux-Loups
,
Aubiers
on
*NL*
the
bank
of
the
Marne
,
Mont-Souris
,
the
Tombe-Issoire
,
the
Pierre-Plate
*NL*
de
Chatillon
,
where
there
is
an
old
,
exhausted
quarry
which
no
longer
*NL*
serves
any
purpose
except
to
raise
mushrooms
,
and
which
is
closed
,
on
a
*NL*
level
with
the
ground
,
by
a
trap-door
of
rotten
planks
.
The
campagna
of
*NL*
Rome
is
one
idea
,
the
banlieue
of
Paris
is
another
;
to
behold
nothing
*NL*
but
fields
,
houses
,
or
trees
in
what
a
stretch
of
country
offers
us
,
is
*NL*
to
remain
on
the
surface
;
all
aspects
of
things
are
thoughts
of
God
.
The
*NL*
spot
where
a
plain
effects
its
junction
with
a
city
is
always
stamped
*NL*
with
a
certain
piercing
melancholy
.
Nature
and
humanity
both
appeal
*NL*
to
you
at
the
same
time
there
.
Local
originalities
there
make
their
*NL*
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
,
like
ourselves
,
has
wandered
about
in
these
solitudes
*NL*
contiguous
to
our
faubourgs
,
which
may
be
designated
as
the
limbos
of
*NL*
Paris
,
has
seen
here
and
there
,
in
the
most
desert
spot
,
at
the
*NL*
most
unexpected
moment
,
behind
a
meagre
hedge
,
or
in
the
corner
of
a
*NL*
lugubrious
wall
,
children
grouped
tumultuously
,
fetid
,
muddy
,
*NL*
dusty
,
ragged
,
dishevelled
,
playing
hide-and-seek
,
and
crowned
with
*NL*
corn-flowers
.
All
of
them
are
little
ones
who
have
made
their
escape
*NL*
from
poor
families
.
The
outer
boulevard
is
their
breathing
space
;
the
*NL*
suburbs
belong
to
them
.
There
they
are
eternally
playing
truant
.
There
*NL*
they
innocently
sing
their
repertory
of
dirty
songs
.
There
they
are
,
or
*NL*
rather
,
there
they
exist
,
far
from
every
eye
,
in
the
sweet
light
of
*NL*
May
or
June
,
kneeling
round
a
hole
in
the
ground
,
snapping
marbles
with
*NL*
their
thumbs
,
quarrelling
over
half-farthings
,
irresponsible
,
volatile
,
*NL*
free
and
happy
;
and
,
no
sooner
do
they
catch
sight
of
you
than
they
*NL*
recollect
that
they
have
an
industry
,
and
that
they
must
earn
their
*NL*
living
,
and
they
offer
to
sell
you
an
old
woollen
stocking
filled
*NL*
with
cockchafers
,
or
a
bunch
of
lilacs
.
These
encounters
with
strange
*NL*
children
are
one
of
the
charming
and
at
the
same
time
poignant
graces
of
*NL*
the
environs
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
there
are
little
girls
among
the
throng
of
boys
,
--
are
they
*NL*
their
sisters
?
--
who
are
almost
young
maidens
,
thin
,
feverish
,
with
*NL*
sunburnt
hands
,
covered
with
freckles
,
crowned
with
poppies
and
ears
of
*NL*
rye
,
gay
,
haggard
,
barefooted
.
They
can
be
seen
devouring
cherries
among
*NL*
the
wheat
.
In
the
evening
they
can
be
heard
laughing
.
These
groups
,
*NL*
warmly
illuminated
by
the
full
glow
of
midday
,
or
indistinctly
seen
in
*NL*
the
twilight
,
occupy
the
thoughtful
man
for
a
very
long
time
,
and
these
*NL*
visions
mingle
with
his
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
,
centre
,
banlieue
,
circumference
;
this
constitutes
all
the
earth
*NL*
to
those
children
.
They
never
venture
beyond
this
.
They
can
no
more
*NL*
escape
from
the
Parisian
atmosphere
than
fish
can
escape
from
the
*NL*
water
.
For
them
,
nothing
exists
two
leagues
beyond
the
barriers
:

Ivry
,
Gentilly
,
Arcueil
,
Belleville

CHAPTER
VI
--
A
BIT
OF
HISTORY
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
epoch
,
nearly
contemporary
by
the
way
,
when
the
action
of
this
*NL*
book
takes
place
,
there
was
not
,
as
there
is
to-day
,
a
policeman
at
*NL*
the
corner
of
every
street
-LRB-
a
benefit
which
there
is
no
time
to
discuss
*NL*
here
-RRB-
;
stray
children
abounded
in
Paris
.
The
statistics
give
an
average
*NL*
of
two
hundred
and
sixty
homeless
children
picked
up
annually
at
that
*NL*
period
,
by
the
police
patrols
,
in
unenclosed
lands
,
in
houses
in
process
*NL*
of
construction
,
and
under
the
arches
of
the
bridges
.
One
of
these
*NL*
nests
,
which
has
become
famous
,
produced
``
the
swallows
of
the
bridge
of
*NL*
Arcola
.
''
This
is
,
moreover
,
the
most
disastrous
of
social
symptoms
.
All
*NL*
crimes
of
the
man
begin
in
the
vagabondage
of
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
make
an
exception
in
favor
of
Paris
,
nevertheless
.
In
a
relative
*NL*
measure
,
and
in
spite
of
the
souvenir
which
we
have
just
recalled
,
the
*NL*
exception
is
just
.
While
in
any
other
great
city
the
vagabond
child
is
*NL*
a
lost
man
,
while
nearly
everywhere
the
child
left
to
itself
is
,
in
*NL*
some
sort
,
sacrificed
and
abandoned
to
a
kind
of
fatal
immersion
in
the
*NL*
public
vices
which
devour
in
him
honesty
and
conscience
,
the
street
boy
*NL*
of
Paris
,
we
insist
on
this
point
,
however
defaced
and
injured
on
the
*NL*
surface
,
is
almost
intact
on
the
interior
.
It
is
a
magnificent
thing
to
*NL*
put
on
record
,
and
one
which
shines
forth
in
the
splendid
probity
of
our
*NL*
popular
revolutions
,
that
a
certain
incorruptibility
results
from
the
*NL*
idea
which
exists
in
the
air
of
Paris
,
as
salt
exists
in
the
water
of
*NL*
the
ocean
.
To
breathe
Paris
preserves
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
we
have
just
said
takes
away
nothing
of
the
anguish
of
heart
which
*NL*
one
experiences
every
time
that
one
meets
one
of
these
children
around
*NL*
whom
one
fancies
that
he
beholds
floating
the
threads
of
a
broken
*NL*
family
.
In
the
civilization
of
the
present
day
,
incomplete
as
it
still
*NL*
is
,
it
is
not
a
very
abnormal
thing
to
behold
these
fractured
families
*NL*
pouring
themselves
out
into
the
darkness
,
not
knowing
clearly
what
has
*NL*
become
of
their
children
,
and
allowing
their
own
entrails
to
fall
on
the
*NL*
public
highway
.
Hence
these
obscure
destinies
.
This
is
called
,
for
this
*NL*
sad
thing
has
given
rise
to
an
expression
,
``
to
be
cast
on
the
pavements
*NL*
of
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Let
it
be
said
by
the
way
,
that
this
abandonment
of
children
was
not
*NL*
discouraged
by
the
ancient
monarchy
.
A
little
of
Egypt
and
Bohemia
in
*NL*
the
lower
regions
suited
the
upper
spheres
,
and
compassed
the
aims
of
*NL*
the
powerful
.
The
hatred
of
instruction
for
the
children
of
the
people
*NL*
was
a
dogma
.
What
is
the
use
of
``
half-lights
''
?
Such
was
the
countersign
.
*NL*
Now
,
the
erring
child
is
the
corollary
of
the
ignorant
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
the
monarchy
sometimes
was
in
need
of
children
,
and
in
*NL*
that
case
it
skimmed
the
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
Louis
XIV.
,
not
to
go
any
further
back
,
the
king
rightly
desired
*NL*
to
create
a
fleet
.
The
idea
was
a
good
one
.
But
let
us
consider
*NL*
the
means
.
There
can
be
no
fleet
,
if
,
beside
the
sailing
ship
,
that
*NL*
plaything
of
the
winds
,
and
for
the
purpose
of
towing
it
,
in
case
of
*NL*
necessity
,
there
is
not
the
vessel
which
goes
where
it
pleases
,
either
*NL*
by
means
of
oars
or
of
steam
;
the
galleys
were
then
to
the
marine
what
*NL*
steamers
are
to-day
.
Therefore
,
galleys
were
necessary
;
but
the
galley
*NL*
is
moved
only
by
the
galley-slave
;
hence
,
galley-slaves
were
required
.
*NL*
Colbert
had
the
commissioners
of
provinces
and
the
parliaments
make
*NL*
as
many
convicts
as
possible
.
The
magistracy
showed
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
complaisance
in
the
matter
.
A
man
kept
his
hat
on
in
the
presence
of
a
*NL*
procession
--
it
was
a
Huguenot
attitude
;
he
was
sent
to
the
galleys
.
A
*NL*
child
was
encountered
in
the
streets
;
provided
that
he
was
fifteen
*NL*
years
of
age
and
did
not
know
where
he
was
to
sleep
,
he
was
sent
to
the
*NL*
galleys
.
Grand
reign
;
grand
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
Louis
XV
.
children
disappeared
in
Paris
;
the
police
carried
them
*NL*
off
,
for
what
mysterious
purpose
no
one
knew
.
People
whispered
with
*NL*
terror
monstrous
conjectures
as
to
the
king
's
baths
of
purple
.
Barbier
*NL*
speaks
ingenuously
of
these
things
.
It
sometimes
happened
that
the
*NL*
exempts
of
the
guard
,
when
they
ran
short
of
children
,
took
those
who
*NL*
had
fathers
.
The
fathers
,
in
despair
,
attacked
the
exempts
.
In
that
*NL*
case
,
the
parliament
intervened
and
had
some
one
hung
.
Who
?
The
exempts
?
*NL*
No

the

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
GAMIN
SHOULD
HAVE
HIS
PLACE
IN
THE
CLASSIFICATIONS
OF
*NL*
INDIA
*NL*
*NL*
The
body
of
street
Arabs
in
Paris
almost
constitutes
a
caste
.
One
might
*NL*
almost
say
:
Not
every
one
who
wishes
to
belong
to
it
can
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
gamin
was
printed
for
the
first
time
,
and
reached
popular
*NL*
speech
through
the
literary
tongue
,
in
1834
.
It
is
in
a
little
work
*NL*
entitled
Claude
Gueux
that
this
word
made
its
appearance
.
The
horror
was
*NL*
lively
.
The
word
passed
into
circulation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elements
which
constitute
the
consideration
of
the
gamins
for
each
*NL*
other
are
very
various
.
We
have
known
and
associated
with
one
who
was
*NL*
greatly
respected
and
vastly
admired
because
he
had
seen
a
man
fall
from
*NL*
the
top
of
the
tower
of
Notre-Dame
;
another
,
because
he
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
making
his
way
into
the
rear
courtyard
where
the
statues
of
the
dome
*NL*
of
the
Invalides
had
been
temporarily
deposited
,
and
had
``
prigged
''
some
*NL*
lead
from
them
;
a
third
,
because
he
had
seen
a
diligence
tip
over
;
still
*NL*
another
,
because
he
``
knew
''
a
soldier
who
came
near
putting
out
the
eye
*NL*
of
a
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
explains
that
famous
exclamation
of
a
Parisian
gamin
,
a
profound
*NL*
epiphonema
,
which
the
vulgar
herd
laughs
at
without
comprehending
,
--
Dieu
*NL*
de
Dieu
!
What
ill-luck
I
do
have
!
to
think
that
I
have
never
yet
seen
*NL*
anybody
tumble
from
a
fifth-story
window
!
-LRB-
I
have
pronounced
I
`
ave
and
*NL*
fifth
pronounced
fift
'
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
,
this
saying
of
a
peasant
is
a
fine
one
:
``
Father
So-and-So
,
your
*NL*
wife
has
died
of
her
malady
;
why
did
you
not
send
for
the
doctor
?
''
*NL*
``
What
would
you
have
,
sir
,
we
poor
folks
die
of
ourselves
.
''
But
if
*NL*
the
peasant
's
whole
passivity
lies
in
this
saying
,
the
whole
of
the
*NL*
free-thinking
anarchy
of
the
brat
of
the
faubourgs
is
,
assuredly
,
*NL*
contained
in
this
other
saying
.
A
man
condemned
to
death
is
listening
*NL*
to
his
confessor
in
the
tumbrel
.
The
child
of
Paris
exclaims
:
``
He
is
*NL*
talking
to
his
black
cap
!
Oh
,
the
sneak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
audacity
on
matters
of
religion
sets
off
the
gamin
.
To
be
*NL*
strong-minded
is
an
important
item
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
present
at
executions
constitutes
a
duty
.
He
shows
himself
at
the
*NL*
guillotine
,
and
he
laughs
.
He
calls
it
by
all
sorts
of
pet
names
:
The
*NL*
End
of
the
Soup
,
The
Growler
,
The
Mother
in
the
Blue
-LRB-
the
sky
-RRB-
,
The
Last
*NL*
Mouthful
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
In
order
not
to
lose
anything
of
the
affair
,
he
*NL*
scales
the
walls
,
he
hoists
himself
to
balconies
,
he
ascends
trees
,
he
*NL*
suspends
himself
to
gratings
,
he
clings
fast
to
chimneys
.
The
gamin
is
*NL*
born
a
tiler
as
he
is
born
a
mariner
.
A
roof
inspires
him
with
no
more
*NL*
fear
than
a
mast
.
There
is
no
festival
which
comes
up
to
an
execution
*NL*
on
the
Place
de
Greve
.
Samson
and
the
Abbe
Montes
are
the
truly
popular
*NL*
names
.
They
hoot
at
the
victim
in
order
to
encourage
him
.
They
sometimes
*NL*
admire
him
.
Lacenaire
,
when
a
gamin
,
on
seeing
the
hideous
Dautin
die
*NL*
bravely
,
uttered
these
words
which
contain
a
future
:
``
I
was
jealous
of
*NL*
him
.
''
In
the
brotherhood
of
gamins
Voltaire
is
not
known
,
but
Papavoine
*NL*
is
.
``
Politicians
''
are
confused
with
assassins
in
the
same
legend
.
*NL*
They
have
a
tradition
as
to
everybody
's
last
garment
.
It
is
known
that
*NL*
Tolleron
had
a
fireman
's
cap
,
Avril
an
otter
cap
,
Losvel
a
round
hat
,
*NL*
that
old
Delaporte
was
bald
and
bare-headed
,
that
Castaing
was
all
ruddy
*NL*
and
very
handsome
,
that
Bories
had
a
romantic
small
beard
,
that
Jean
*NL*
Martin
kept
on
his
suspenders
,
that
Lecouffe
and
his
mother
quarrelled
.
*NL*
``
Do
n't
reproach
each
other
for
your
basket
,
''
shouted
a
gamin
to
them
.
*NL*
Another
,
in
order
to
get
a
look
at
Debacker
as
he
passed
,
and
being
too
*NL*
small
in
the
crowd
,
caught
sight
of
the
lantern
on
the
quay
and
climbed
*NL*
it
.
A
gendarme
stationed
opposite
frowned
.
``
Let
me
climb
up
,
m
`
sieu
le
*NL*
gendarme
,
''
said
the
gamin
.
And
,
to
soften
the
heart
of
the
authorities
*NL*
he
added
:
``
I
will
not
fall
.
''
``
I
do
n't
care
if
you
do
,
''
retorted
the
*NL*
gendarme
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
brotherhood
of
gamins
,
a
memorable
accident
counts
for
a
great
*NL*
deal
.
One
reaches
the
height
of
consideration
if
one
chances
to
cut
*NL*
one
's
self
very
deeply
,
``
to
the
very
bone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fist
is
no
mediocre
element
of
respect
.
One
of
the
things
that
the
*NL*
gamin
is
fondest
of
saying
is
:
``
I
am
fine
and
strong
,
come
now
!
''
To
be
*NL*
left-handed
renders
you
very
enviable
.
A
squint
is
highly
esteemed
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
IN
WHICH
THE
READER
WILL
FIND
A
CHARMING
SAYING
OF
THE
*NL*
LAST
KING
*NL*
*NL*
In
summer
,
he
metamorphoses
himself
into
a
frog
;
and
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
when
night
is
falling
,
in
front
of
the
bridges
of
Austerlitz
and
Jena
,
*NL*
from
the
tops
of
coal
wagons
,
and
the
washerwomen
's
boats
,
he
hurls
*NL*
himself
headlong
into
the
Seine
,
and
into
all
possible
infractions
of
*NL*
the
laws
of
modesty
and
of
the
police
.
Nevertheless
the
police
keep
an
*NL*
eye
on
him
,
and
the
result
is
a
highly
dramatic
situation
which
*NL*
once
gave
rise
to
a
fraternal
and
memorable
cry
;
that
cry
which
was
*NL*
celebrated
about
1830
,
is
a
strategic
warning
from
gamin
to
gamin
;
it
*NL*
scans
like
a
verse
from
Homer
,
with
a
notation
as
inexpressible
as
the
*NL*
eleusiac
chant
of
the
Panathenaea
,
and
in
it
one
encounters
again
the
*NL*
ancient
Evohe
.
Here
it
is
:
``
Ohe
,
Titi
,
oheee
!
Here
comes
the
bobby
,
here
*NL*
comes
the
p
`
lice
,
pick
up
your
duds
and
be
off
,
through
the
sewer
with
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
this
gnat
--
that
is
what
he
calls
himself
--
knows
how
to
read
;
*NL*
sometimes
he
knows
how
to
write
;
he
always
knows
how
to
daub
.
He
*NL*
does
not
hesitate
to
acquire
,
by
no
one
knows
what
mysterious
mutual
*NL*
instruction
,
all
the
talents
which
can
be
of
use
to
the
public
;
from
*NL*
1815
to
1830
,
he
imitated
the
cry
of
the
turkey
;
from
1830
to
1848
,
he
*NL*
scrawled
pears
on
the
walls
.
One
summer
evening
,
when
Louis
Philippe
was
*NL*
returning
home
on
foot
,
he
saw
a
little
fellow
,
no
higher
than
his
knee
,
*NL*
perspiring
and
climbing
up
to
draw
a
gigantic
pear
in
charcoal
on
one
*NL*
of
the
pillars
of
the
gate
of
Neuilly
;
the
King
,
with
that
good-nature
*NL*
which
came
to
him
from
Henry
IV.
,
helped
the
gamin
,
finished
the
pear
,
*NL*
and
gave
the
child
a
louis
,
saying
:
``
The
pear
is
on
that
also
.
''

*NL*
The
gamin
loves
uproar
.
A
certain
state
of
violence
pleases
him
.
He
*NL*
execrates
``
the
cures
.
''
One
day
,
in
the
Rue
de
l'Universite
,
one
of
these
*NL*
scamps
was
putting
his
thumb
to
his
nose
at
the
carriage
gate
of
No.
*NL*
69
.
``
Why
are
you
doing
that
at
the
gate
?
''
a
passer-by
asked
.
The
boy
*NL*
replied
:
``
There
is
a
cure
there
.
''
It
was
there
,
in
fact
,
that
the
Papal
*NL*
Nuncio
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
whatever
may
be
the
Voltairianism
of
the
small
gamin
,
if
*NL*
the
occasion
to
become
a
chorister
presents
itself
,
it
is
quite
possible
*NL*
that
he
will
accept
,
and
in
that
case
he
serves
the
mass
civilly
.
There
*NL*
are
two
things
to
which
he
plays
Tantalus
,
and
which
he
always
desires
*NL*
without
ever
attaining
them
:
to
overthrow
the
government
,
and
to
get
his
*NL*
trousers
sewed
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
in
his
perfect
state
possesses
all
the
policemen
of
Paris
,
and
*NL*
can
always
put
the
name
to
the
face
of
any
one
which
he
chances
to
*NL*
meet
.
He
can
tell
them
off
on
the
tips
of
his
fingers
.
He
studies
their
*NL*
habits
,
and
he
has
special
notes
on
each
one
of
them
.
He
reads
the
souls
*NL*
of
the
police
like
an
open
book
.
He
will
tell
you
fluently
and
without
*NL*
flinching
:
``
Such
an
one
is
a
traitor
;
such
another
is
very
malicious
;
*NL*
such
another
is
great
;
such
another
is
ridiculous
.
''
-LRB-
All
these
words
:
*NL*
traitor
,
malicious
,
great
,
ridiculous
,
have
a
particular
meaning
in
his
*NL*
mouth
.
-RRB-
That
one
imagines
that
he
owns
the
Pont-Neuf
,
and
he
prevents

people
from
walking
on

outside
the

Gaminerie
is
a

Mingled

good

it
sometimes
adds
force

as
alcohol

Sometimes
it
is
a
defect

Homer
repeats
himself
*NL*
eternally

granted
;
one
may
say
that
Voltaire
plays
the
gamin

Camille

Desmoulins
was
a
native
of

Championnet

who
treated

miracles
brutally

rose

inundated
the
porticos

he

and
insolent

He
has
*NL*
villainous
teeth
,
because
he
is
badly
fed
and
his
stomach
suffers
,
and
*NL*
handsome
eyes
because
he
has
wit
.
If
Jehovah
himself
were
present
,
he
*NL*
would
go
hopping
up
the
steps
of
paradise
on
one
foot
.
He
is
strong
on
*NL*
boxing
.
All
beliefs
are
possible
to
him
.
He
plays
in
the
gutter
,
and
*NL*
straightens
himself
up
with
a
revolt
;
his
effrontery
persists
even
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
grape-shot
;
he
was
a
scapegrace
,
he
is
a
hero
;
like
the
*NL*
little
Theban
,
he
shakes
the
skin
from
the
lion
;
Barra
the
drummer-boy
*NL*
was
a
gamin
of
Paris
;
he
Shouts
:
``
Forward
!
''
as
the
horse
of
Scripture
*NL*
says
``
Vah
!
''
and
in
a
moment
he
has
passed
from
the
small
brat
to
the
*NL*
giant
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
child
of
the
puddle
is
also
the
child
of
the
ideal

Measure
that

spread
of

which
reaches
from
Moliere

Barra

*NL*
*NL*
To
sum
up
the
whole
,
and
in
one
word
,
the

CHAPTER

ECCE
PARIS
,
ECCE
HOMO
*NL*
*NL*
To
sum
it
all
up
once
more
,
the
Paris
gamin
of
to-day
,
like
the
*NL*
graeculus
of
Rome
in
days
gone
by
,
is
the
infant
populace
with
the
*NL*
wrinkle
of
the
old
world
on
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
is
a
grace
to
the
nation
,
and
at
the
same
time
a
disease
;
a
*NL*
disease
which
must
be
cured
,
how
?
By
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Light
renders
healthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Light
kindles
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
generous
social
irradiations
spring
from
science
,
letters
,
arts
,
*NL*
education
.
Make
men
,
make
men
.
Give
them
light
that
they
may
warm
*NL*
you
.
Sooner
or
later
the
splendid
question
of
universal
education
will
*NL*
present
itself
with
the
irresistible
authority
of
the
absolute
truth
;
*NL*
and
then
,
those
who
govern
under
the
superintendence
of
the
French
idea
*NL*
will
have
to
make
this
choice
;
the
children
of
France
or
the
gamins
of
*NL*
Paris
;
flames
in
the
light
or
will-o
'
-
the-wisps
in
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
expresses
Paris
,
and
Paris
expresses
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Paris
is
a
total
.
Paris
is
the
ceiling
of
the
human
race
.
The
whole
*NL*
of
this
prodigious
city
is
a
foreshortening
of
dead
manners
and
living
*NL*
manners
.
He
who
sees
Paris
thinks
he
sees
the
bottom
of
all
history
with
*NL*
heaven
and
constellations
in
the
intervals
.
Paris
has
a
capital
,
the
*NL*
Town-Hall
,
a
Parthenon
,
Notre-Dame
,
a
Mount
Aventine
,
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Antoine
,
an
Asinarium
,
the
Sorbonne
,
a
Pantheon
,
the
Pantheon
,
a
*NL*
Via
Sacra
,
the
Boulevard
des
Italiens
,
a
temple
of
the
winds
,
opinion
;
*NL*
and
it
replaces
the
Gemoniae
by
ridicule
.
Its
majo
is
called
``
faraud
,
''
*NL*
its
Transteverin
is
the
man
of
the
faubourgs
,
its
hammal
is
the
*NL*
market-porter
,
its
lazzarone
is
the
pegre
,
its
cockney
is
the
native
of
*NL*
Ghent
.
Everything
that
exists
elsewhere
exists
at
Paris
.
The
fishwoman
*NL*
of
Dumarsais
can
retort
on
the
herb-seller
of
Euripides
,
the
*NL*
discobols
Vejanus
lives
again
in
the
Forioso
,
the
tight-rope
dancer
.
*NL*
Therapontigonus
Miles
could
walk
arm
in
arm
with
Vadeboncoeur
the
*NL*
grenadier
,
Damasippus
the
second-hand
dealer
would
be
happy
among
*NL*
bric-a-brac
merchants
,
Vincennes
could
grasp
Socrates
in
its
fist
as
*NL*
just
as
Agora
could
imprison
Diderot
,
Grimod
de
la
Reyniere
discovered
*NL*
larded
roast
beef
,
as
Curtillus
invented
roast
hedgehog
,
we
see
the
*NL*
trapeze
which
figures
in
Plautus
reappear
under
the
vault
of
the
Arc
*NL*
of
l'Etoile
,
the
sword-eater
of
Poecilus
encountered
by
Apuleius
is
a
*NL*
sword-swallower
on
the
Pont
Neuf
,
the
nephew
of
Rameau
and
Curculio
*NL*
the
parasite
make
a
pair
,
Ergasilus
could
get
himself
presented
to
*NL*
Cambaceres
by
d'Aigrefeuille
;
the
four
dandies
of
Rome
:
Alcesimarchus
,
*NL*
Phoedromus
,
Diabolus
,
and
Argyrippus
,
descend
from
Courtille
in
*NL*
Labatut
's
posting-chaise
;
Aulus
Gellius
would
halt
no
longer
in
front
of
*NL*
Congrio
than
would
Charles
Nodier
in
front
of
Punchinello
;
Marto
is
not
*NL*
a
tigress
,
but
Pardalisca
was
not
a
dragon
;
Pantolabus
the
wag
jeers
in
*NL*
the
Cafe
Anglais
at
Nomentanus
the
fast
liver
,
Hermogenus
is
a
tenor
*NL*
in
the
Champs-Elysees
,
and
round
him
,
Thracius
the
beggar
,
clad
like
*NL*
Bobeche
,
takes
up
a
collection
;
the
bore
who
stops
you
by
the
button
*NL*
of
your
coat
in
the
Tuileries
makes
you
repeat
after
a
lapse
of
two
*NL*
thousand
years
Thesprion
's
apostrophe
:
Quis
properantem
me
prehendit
*NL*
pallio
?
The
wine
on
Surene
is
a
parody
of
the
wine
of
Alba
,
the
red
*NL*
border
of
Desaugiers
forms
a
balance
to
the
great
cutting
of
Balatro
,
*NL*
Pere
Lachaise
exhales
beneath
nocturnal
rains
same
gleams
as
the
*NL*
Esquiliae
,
and
the
grave
of
the
poor
bought
for
five
years
,
is
certainly
*NL*
the
equivalent
of
the
slave
's
hived
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seek
something
that
Paris
has
not
.
The
vat
of
Trophonius
contains
*NL*
nothing
that
is
not
in
Mesmer
's
tub
;
Ergaphilas
lives
again
in
*NL*
Cagliostro
;
the
Brahmin
Vasaphanta
become
incarnate
in
the
Comte
de
*NL*
Saint-Germain
;
the
cemetery
of
Saint-Medard
works
quite
as
good
miracles
*NL*
as
the
Mosque
of
Oumoumie
at
Damascus
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
has
an
AEsop-Mayeux
,
and
a
Canidia
,
Mademoiselle
Lenormand
.
It
is
*NL*
terrified
,
like
Delphos
at
the
fulgurating
realities
of
the
vision
;
it
*NL*
makes
tables
turn
as
Dodona
did
tripods
.
It
places
the
grisette
on
the
*NL*
throne
,
as
Rome
placed
the
courtesan
there
;
and
,
taking
it
altogether
,
*NL*
if
Louis
XV
.
is
worse
than
Claudian
,
Madame
Dubarry
is
better
than
*NL*
Messalina
.
Paris
combines
in
an
unprecedented
type
,
which
has
existed
*NL*
and
which
we
have
elbowed
,
Grecian
nudity
,
the
Hebraic
ulcer
,
and
the
*NL*
Gascon
pun
.
It
mingles
Diogenes
,
Job
,
and
Jack-pudding
,
dresses
up
a
*NL*
spectre
in
old
numbers
of
the
Constitutional
,
and
makes
Chodruc
Duclos
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
Plutarch
says
:
the
tyrant
never
grows
old
,
Rome
,
under
Sylla
as
*NL*
under
Domitian
,
resigned
itself
and
willingly
put
water
in
its
wine
.
The
*NL*
Tiber
was
a
Lethe
,
if
the
rather
doctrinary
eulogium
made
of
it
by
Varus
*NL*
Vibiscus
is
to
be
credited
:
Contra
Gracchos
Tiberim
habemus
,
Bibere
*NL*
Tiberim
,
id
est
seditionem
oblivisci
.
Paris
drinks
a
million
litres
of
*NL*
water
a
day
,
but
that
does
not
prevent
it
from
occasionally
beating
the
*NL*
general
alarm
and
ringing
the
tocsin
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
exception
,
Paris
is
amiable
.
It
accepts
everything
royally
;
*NL*
it
is
not
too
particular
about
its
Venus
;
its
Callipyge
is
Hottentot
;
*NL*
provided
that
it
is
made
to
laugh
,
it
condones
;
ugliness
cheers
it
,
*NL*
deformity
provokes
it
to
laughter
,
vice
diverts
it
;
be
eccentric
and
*NL*
you
may
be
an
eccentric
;
even
hypocrisy
,
that
supreme
cynicism
,
does
*NL*
not
disgust
it
;
it
is
so
literary
that
it
does
not
hold
its
nose
before
*NL*
Basile
,
and
is
no
more
scandalized
by
the
prayer
of
Tartuffe
than
Horace
*NL*
was
repelled
by
the
``
hiccup
''
of
Priapus
.
No
trait
of
the
universal
face
*NL*
is
lacking
in
the
profile
of
Paris
.
The
bal
Mabile
is
not
the
polymnia
*NL*
dance
of
the
Janiculum
,
but
the
dealer
in
ladies
'
wearing
apparel
there
*NL*
devours
the
lorette
with
her
eyes
,
exactly
as
the
procuress
Staphyla
*NL*
lay
in
wait
for
the
virgin
Planesium
.
The
Barriere
du
Combat
is
not
*NL*
the
Coliseum
,
but
people
are
as
ferocious
there
as
though
Caesar
were
*NL*
looking
on
.
The
Syrian
hostess
has
more
grace
than
Mother
Saguet
,
*NL*
but
,
if
Virgil
haunted
the
Roman
wine-shop
,
David
d'Angers
,
Balzac
*NL*
and
Charlet
have
sat
at
the
tables
of
Parisian
taverns
.
Paris
reigns
.
*NL*
Geniuses
flash
forth
there
,
the
red
tails
prosper
there
.
Adonai
passes
*NL*
on
his
chariot
with
its
twelve
wheels
of
thunder
and
lightning
;
Silenus
*NL*
makes
his
entry
there
on
his
ass
.
For
Silenus
read
Ramponneau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
is
the
synonym
of
Cosmos
,
Paris
is
Athens
,
Sybaris
,
Jerusalem
,
*NL*
Pantin
.
All
civilizations
are
there
in
an
abridged
form
,
all
barbarisms
*NL*
also
.
Paris
would
greatly
regret
it
if
it
had
not
a
guillotine
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
of
the
Place
de
Greve
is
a
good
thing
.
What
would
all
that
*NL*
eternal
festival
be
without
this
seasoning
?
Our
laws
are
wisely
*NL*
provided
,
and
thanks
to
them
,
this
blade
drips
on
this
Shrove
Tuesday
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
TO
SCOFF
,
TO
REIGN
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
limit
to
Paris
.
No
city
has
had
that
domination
which
*NL*
sometimes
derides
those
whom
it
subjugates
.
To
please
you
,
O
Athenians
!
*NL*
exclaimed
Alexander
.
Paris
makes
more
than
the
law
,
it
makes
the
*NL*
fashion
;
Paris
sets
more
than
the
fashion
,
it
sets
the
routine
.
Paris
*NL*
may
be
stupid
,
if
it
sees
fit
;
it
sometimes
allows
itself
this
luxury
;
*NL*
then
the
universe
is
stupid
in
company
with
it
;
then
Paris
awakes
,
rubs
*NL*
its
eyes
,
says
:
``
How
stupid
I
am
!
''
and
bursts
out
laughing
in
the
face
*NL*
of
the
human
race
.
What
a
marvel
is
such
a
city
!
it
is
a
strange
thing
*NL*
that
this
grandioseness
and
this
burlesque
should
be
amicable
neighbors
,
*NL*
that
all
this
majesty
should
not
be
thrown
into
disorder
by
all
this
*NL*
parody
,
and
that
the
same
mouth
can
to-day
blow
into
the
trump
of
the
*NL*
Judgment
Day
,
and
to-morrow
into
the
reed-flute
!
Paris
has
a
sovereign
*NL*
joviality
.
Its
gayety
is
of
the
thunder
and
its
farce
holds
a
sceptre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Its
tempest
sometimes
proceeds
from
a
grimace
.
Its
explosions
,
its
days
,
*NL*
its
masterpieces
,
its
prodigies
,
its
epics
,
go
forth
to
the
bounds
of
*NL*
the
universe
,
and
so
also
do
its
cock-and-bull
stories
.
Its
laugh
is
the
*NL*
mouth
of
a
volcano
which
spatters
the
whole
earth
.
Its
jests
are
sparks
.
*NL*
It
imposes
its
caricatures
as
well
as
its
ideal
on
people
;
the
highest
*NL*
monuments
of
human
civilization
accept
its
ironies
and
lend
their
*NL*
eternity
to
its
mischievous
pranks
.
It
is
superb
;
it
has
a
prodigious
*NL*
14th
of
July
,
which
delivers
the
globe
;
it
forces
all
nations
to
take
*NL*
the
oath
of
tennis
;
its
night
of
the
4th
of
August
dissolves
in
three
*NL*
hours
a
thousand
years
of
feudalism
;
it
makes
of
its
logic
the
muscle
*NL*
of
unanimous
will
;
it
multiplies
itself
under
all
sorts
of
forms
of
*NL*
the
sublime
;
it
fills
with
its
light
Washington
,
Kosciusko
,
Bolivar
,
*NL*
Bozzaris
,
Riego
,
Bem
,
Manin
,
Lopez
,
John
Brown
,
Garibaldi
;
it
is
*NL*
everywhere
where
the
future
is
being
lighted
up
,
at
Boston
in
1779
,
*NL*
at
the
Isle
de
Leon
in
1820
,
at
Pesth
in
1848
,
at
Palermo
in
1860
,
it
*NL*
whispers
the
mighty
countersign
:
Liberty
,
in
the
ear
of
the
American
*NL*
abolitionists
grouped
about
the
boat
at
Harper
's
Ferry
,
and
in
the
ear
*NL*
of
the
patriots
of
Ancona
assembled
in
the
shadow
,
to
the
Archi
before
*NL*
the
Gozzi
inn
on
the
seashore
;
it
creates
Canaris
;
it
creates
Quiroga
;
*NL*
it
creates
Pisacane
;
it
irradiates
the
great
on
earth
;
it
was
while
*NL*
proceeding
whither
its
breath
urge
them
,
that
Byron
perished
at
*NL*
Missolonghi
,
and
that
Mazet
died
at
Barcelona
;
it
is
the
tribune
under
*NL*
the
feet
of
Mirabeau
,
and
a
crater
under
the
feet
of
Robespierre
;
*NL*
its
books
,
its
theatre
,
its
art
,
its
science
,
its
literature
,
its
*NL*
philosophy
,
are
the
manuals
of
the
human
race
;
it
has
Pascal
,
Regnier
,
*NL*
Corneille
,
Descartes
,
Jean-Jacques
:
Voltaire
for
all
moments
,
Moliere
*NL*
for
all
centuries
;
it
makes
its
language
to
be
talked
by
the
universal
*NL*
mouth
,
and
that
language
becomes
the
word
;
it
constructs
in
all
minds
*NL*
the
idea
of
progress
,
the
liberating
dogmas
which
it
forges
are
for
the
*NL*
generations
trusty
friends
,
and
it
is
with
the
soul
of
its
thinkers
and
*NL*
its
poets
that
all
heroes
of
all
nations
have
been
made
since
1789
;
this
*NL*
does
not
prevent
vagabondism
,
and
that
enormous
genius
which
is
called
*NL*
Paris
,
while
transfiguring
the
world
by
its
light
,
sketches
in
charcoal
*NL*
Bouginier
's
nose
on
the
wall
of
the
temple
of
Theseus
and
writes
*NL*
Credeville
the
thief
on
the
Pyramids
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
is
always
showing
its
teeth
;
when
it
is
not
scolding
it
is
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
Paris
.
The
smoke
of
its
roofs
forms
the
ideas
of
the
universe
.
A
*NL*
heap
of
mud
and
stone
,
if
you
will
,
but
,
above
all
,
a
moral
being
.
It
is
*NL*
more
than
great
,
it
is
immense
.
Why
?
Because
it
is
daring
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
dare
;
that
is
the
price
of
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
sublime
conquests
are
,
more
or
less
,
the
prizes
of
daring
.
In
*NL*
order
that
the
Revolution
should

place

it
does
not
suffice
that
*NL*
Montesquieu
should
foresee

,
that
Diderot
should
preach

that
*NL*
Beaumarchais
should
announce

that

that

*NL*
*NL*
The
cry

Audacity

is
a
Fiat
lux
.
It
is
necessary
,
for
the
sake
of

forward

Daring

CHAPTER
XII
--
THE
FUTURE
LATENT
IN
THE
PEOPLE
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
Parisian
populace
,
even
when
a
man
grown
,
it
is
always
the
*NL*
street
Arab
;
to
paint
the
child
is
to
paint
the
city
;
and
it
is
for
that
*NL*
reason
that
we
have
studied
this
eagle
in
this
arrant
sparrow
.
It
is
in
*NL*
the
faubourgs
,
above
all
,
we
maintain
,
that
the
Parisian
race
appears
;
*NL*
there
is
the
pure
blood
;
there
is
the
true
physiognomy
;
there
this
*NL*
people
toils
and
suffers
,
and
suffering
and
toil
are
the
two
faces
of
*NL*
man
.
There
exist
there
immense
numbers
of
unknown
beings
,
among
whom
*NL*
swarm
types
of
the
strangest
,
from
the
porter
of
la
Rapee
to
the
knacker
*NL*
of
Montfaucon
.
Fex
urbis
,
exclaims
Cicero
;
mob
,
adds
Burke
,
indignantly
;
*NL*
rabble
,
multitude
,
populace
.
These
are
words
and
quickly
uttered
.
But
*NL*
so
be
it
.
What
does
it
matter
?
What
is
it
to
me
if
they
do
go
barefoot
!
*NL*
They
do
not
know
how
to
read
;
so
much
the
worse
.
Would
you
abandon
them
*NL*
for
that
?
Would
you
turn
their
distress
into
a
malediction
?
Can
not
the
*NL*
light
penetrate
these
masses
?
Let
us
return
to
that
cry
:
Light
!
and
let
*NL*
us
obstinately
persist
therein
!
Light
!
Light
!
Who
knows
whether
*NL*
these
opacities
will
not
become
transparent
?
Are
not
revolutions
*NL*
transfigurations
?
Come
,
philosophers
,
teach
,
enlighten
,
light
up
,
think
*NL*
aloud
,
speak
aloud
,
hasten
joyously
to
the
great
sun
,
fraternize
with
*NL*
the
public
place
,
announce
the
good
news
,
spend
your
alphabets
lavishly
,
*NL*
proclaim
rights
,
sing
the
Marseillaises
,
sow
enthusiasms
,
tear
green
*NL*
boughs
from
the
oaks
.
Make
a
whirlwind
of
the
idea
.
This
crowd
may
*NL*
be
rendered
sublime
.
Let
us
learn
how
to
make
use
of
that
vast
*NL*
conflagration
of
principles
and
virtues
,
which
sparkles
,
bursts
forth
*NL*
and
quivers
at
certain
hours
.
These
bare
feet
,
these
bare
arms
,
these
*NL*
rags
,
these
ignorances
,
these
abjectnesses
,
these
darknesses
,
may
be
*NL*
employed
in
the
conquest
of
the
ideal
.
Gaze
past
the
people
,
and
you
*NL*
will
perceive
truth
.
Let
that
vile
sand
which
you
trample
under
foot
be
*NL*
cast
into
the
furnace
,
let
it
melt
and
seethe
there
,
it
will
become
a
*NL*
splendid
crystal
,
and
it
is
thanks
to
it
that
Galileo
and
Newton
will
*NL*
discover
stars
.

LITTLE
GAVROCHE

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Eight
or
nine
years
after
the
events
narrated
in
the
second
part
of
this
*NL*
story
,
people
noticed
on
the
Boulevard
du
Temple
,
and
in
the
regions
of
*NL*
the
Chateau-d'Eau
,
a
little
boy
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
,
who
would
*NL*
have
realized
with
tolerable
accuracy
that
ideal
of
the
gamin
sketched
*NL*
out
above
,
if
,
with
the
laugh
of
his
age
on
his
lips
,
he
had
not
had
a
*NL*
heart
absolutely
sombre
and
empty
.
This
child
was
well
muffled
up
in
a
*NL*
pair
of
man
's
trousers
,
but
he
did
not
get
them
from
his
father
,
and
a
*NL*
woman
's
chemise
,
but
he
did
not
get
it
from
his
mother
.
Some
people
or
*NL*
other
had
clothed
him
in
rags
out
of
charity
.
Still
,
he
had
a
father
and
*NL*
a
mother
.
But
his
father
did
not
think
of
him
,
and
his
mother
did
not
*NL*
love
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
one
of
those
children
most
deserving
of
pity
,
among
all
,
one
of
*NL*
those
who
have
father
and
mother
,
and
who
are
orphans
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
child
never
felt
so
well
as
when
he
was
in
the
street
.
The
*NL*
pavements
were
less
hard
to
him
than
his
mother
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
parents
had
despatched
him
into
life
with
a
kick
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
simply
took
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
boisterous
,
pallid
,
nimble
,
wide-awake
,
jeering
,
lad
,
with
a
*NL*
vivacious
but
sickly
air
.
He
went
and
came
,
sang
,
played
at
hopscotch
,
*NL*
scraped
the
gutters
,
stole
a
little
,
but
,
like
cats
and
sparrows
,
gayly
*NL*
laughed
when
he
was
called
a
rogue
,
and
got
angry
when
called
a
thief
.
*NL*
He
had
no
shelter
,
no
bread
,
no
fire
,
no
love
;
but
he
was
merry
because
*NL*
he
was
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
these
poor
creatures
grow
to
be
men
,
the
millstones
of
the
social
*NL*
order
meet
them
and
crush
them
,
but
so
long
as
they
are
children
,
they
*NL*
escape
because
of
their
smallness
.
The
tiniest
hole
saves
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
abandoned
as
this
child
was
,
it
sometimes
happened
,
every
*NL*
two
or
three
months
,
that
he
said
,
``
Come
,
I
'll
go
and
see
mamma
!
''
Then
*NL*
he
quitted
the
boulevard
,
the
Cirque
,
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
,
descended
*NL*
to
the
quays
,
crossed
the
bridges
,
reached
the
suburbs
,
arrived
at
the
*NL*
Salpetriere
,
and
came
to
a
halt
,
where
?
Precisely
at
that
double
number
*NL*
50-52
with
which
the
reader
is
acquainted
--
at
the
Gorbeau
hovel
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
the
hovel
50-52
generally
deserted
and
eternally
*NL*
decorated
with
the
placard
:
``
Chambers
to
let
,
''
chanced
to
be
,
a
rare
*NL*
thing
,
inhabited
by
numerous
individuals
who
,
however
,
as
is
always
the
*NL*
case
in
Paris
,
had
no
connection
with
each
other
.
All
belonged
to
*NL*
that
indigent
class
which
begins
to
separate
from
the
lowest
of
petty
*NL*
bourgeoisie
in
straitened
circumstances
,
and
which
extends
from
misery
*NL*
to
misery
into
the
lowest
depths
of
society
down
to
those
two
beings
*NL*
in
whom
all
the
material
things
of
civilization
end
,
the
sewer-man
who
*NL*
sweeps
up
the
mud
,
and
the
ragpicker
who
collects
scraps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
principal
lodger
''
of
Jean
Valjean
's
day
was
dead
and
had
been
*NL*
replaced
by
another
exactly
like
her
.
I
know
not
what
philosopher
has
*NL*
said
:
``
Old
women
are
never
lacking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
new
old
woman
was
named
Madame
Bourgon
,
and
had
nothing
remarkable
*NL*
about
her
life
except
a
dynasty
of
three
paroquets
,
who
had
reigned
in
*NL*
succession
over
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
miserable
of
those
who
inhabited
the
hovel
were
a
family
of
*NL*
four
persons
,
consisting
of
father
,
mother
,
and
two
daughters
,
already
*NL*
well
grown
,
all
four
of
whom
were
lodged
in
the
same
attic
,
one
of
the
*NL*
cells
which
we
have
already
mentioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
sight
,
this
family
presented
no
very
special
feature
except
its
*NL*
extreme
destitution
;
the
father
,
when
he
hired
the
chamber
,
had
stated
*NL*
that
his
name
was
Jondrette
.
Some
time
after
his
moving
in
,
which
had
*NL*
borne
a
singular
resemblance
to
the
entrance
of
nothing
at
all
,
to
*NL*
borrow
the
memorable
expression
of
the
principal
tenant
,
this
Jondrette
*NL*
had
said
to
the
woman
,
who
,
like
her
predecessor
,
was
at
the
same
time
*NL*
portress
and
stair-sweeper
:
``
Mother
So-and-So
,
if
any
one
should
chance
*NL*
to
come
and
inquire
for
a
Pole
or
an
Italian
,
or
even
a
Spaniard
,
*NL*
perchance
,
it
is
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
family
was
that
of
the
merry
barefoot
boy
.
He
arrived
there
and
*NL*
found
distress
,
and
,
what
is
still
sadder
,
no
smile
;
a
cold
hearth
*NL*
and
cold
hearts
.
When
he
entered
,
he
was
asked
:
``
Whence
come
you
?
''
He
*NL*
replied
:
``
From
the
street
.
''
When
he
went
away
,
they
asked
him
:
``
Whither
*NL*
are
you
going
?
''
He
replied
:
``
Into
the
streets
.
''
His
mother
said
to
him
:
*NL*
``
What
did
you
come
here
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
child
lived
,
in
this
absence
of
affection
,
like
the
pale
plants
*NL*
which
spring
up
in
cellars
.
It
did
not
cause
him
suffering
,
and
he
*NL*
blamed
no
one
.
He
did
not
know
exactly
how
a
father
and
mother
should
*NL*
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
his
mother
loved
his
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
forgotten
to
mention
,
that
on
the
Boulevard
du
Temple
this
child
*NL*
was
called
Little
Gavroche
.
Why
was
he
called
Little
Gavroche
?
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
because
his
father
's
name
was
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seems
to
be
the
instinct
of
certain
wretched
families
to
break
the
*NL*
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chamber
which
the
Jondrettes
inhabited
in
the
Gorbeau
hovel
was
the
*NL*
last
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
.
The
cell
next
to
it
was
occupied
by
a
*NL*
very
poor
young
man
who
was
called
M.
Marius
.

Marius

--
NINETY
YEARS
AND
THIRTY-TWO
TEETH
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Rue
Boucherat
,
Rue
de
Normandie
and
the
Rue
de
Saintonge
there
*NL*
still
exist
a
few
ancient
inhabitants
who
have
preserved
the
memory
of
a
*NL*
worthy
man
named
M.
Gillenormand
,
and
who
mention
him
with
complaisance
.
*NL*
This
good
man
was
old
when
they
were
young
.
This
silhouette
has
not
yet
*NL*
entirely
disappeared
--
for
those
who
regard
with
melancholy
that
vague
*NL*
swarm
of
shadows
which
is
called
the
past
--
from
the
labyrinth
of
streets
*NL*
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Temple
to
which
,
under
Louis
XIV.
,
the
names
of
*NL*
all
the
provinces
of
France
were
appended
exactly
as
in
our
day
,
the
*NL*
streets
of
the
new
Tivoli
quarter
have
received
the
names
of
all
the
*NL*
capitals
of
Europe
;
a
progression
,
by
the
way
,
in
which
progress
is
*NL*
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.Gillenormand
,
who
was
as
much
alive
as
possible
in
1831
,
was
one
of
*NL*
those
men
who
had
become
curiosities
to
be
viewed
,
simply
because
*NL*
they
have
lived
a
long
time
,
and
who
are
strange
because
they
formerly
*NL*
resembled
everybody
,
and
now
resemble
nobody
.
He
was
a
peculiar
old
man
,
*NL*
and
in
very
truth
,
a
man
of
another
age
,
the
real
,
complete
and
rather
*NL*
haughty
bourgeois
of
the
eighteenth
century
,
who
wore
his
good
,
old
*NL*
bourgeoisie
with
the
air
with
which
marquises
wear
their
marquisates
.
He
*NL*
was
over
ninety
years
of
age
,
his
walk
was
erect
,
he
talked
loudly
,
saw
*NL*
clearly
,
drank
neat
,
ate
,
slept
,
and
snored
.
He
had
all
thirty-two
of
*NL*
his
teeth
.
He
only
wore
spectacles
when
he
read
.
He
was
of
an
amorous
*NL*
disposition
,
but
declared
that
,
for
the
last
ten
years
,
he
had
wholly
*NL*
and
decidedly
renounced
women
.
He
could
no
longer
please
,
he
said
;
he
*NL*
did
not
add
:
``
I
am
too
old
,
''
but
:
``
I
am
too
poor
.
''
He
said
:
``
If
I
were
*NL*
not
ruined
--
Heee
!
''
All
he
had
left
,
in
fact
,
was
an
income
of
about
*NL*
fifteen
thousand
francs
.
His
dream
was
to
come
into
an
inheritance
and
*NL*
to
have
a
hundred
thousand
livres
income
for
mistresses
.
He
did
*NL*
not
belong
,
as
the
reader
will
perceive
,
to
that
puny
variety
of
*NL*
octogenaries
who
,
like
M.
de
Voltaire
,
have
been
dying
all
their
life
;
*NL*
his
was
no
longevity
of
a
cracked
pot
;
this
jovial
old
man
had
always
*NL*
had
good
health
.
He
was
superficial
,
rapid
,
easily
angered
.
He
flew
into
*NL*
a
passion
at
everything
,
generally
quite
contrary
to
all
reason
.
When
*NL*
contradicted
,
he
raised
his
cane
;
he
beat
people
as
he
had
done
in
the
*NL*
great
century
.
He
had
a
daughter
over
fifty
years
of
age
,
and
unmarried
,
*NL*
whom
he
chastised
severely
with
his
tongue
,
when
in
a
rage
,
and
whom
he
*NL*
would
have
liked
to
whip
.
She
seemed
to
him
to
be
eight
years
old
.
He
*NL*
boxed
his
servants
'
ears
soundly
,
and
said
:
``
Ah
!
carogne
!
''
One
of
his
*NL*
oaths
was
:
``
By
the
pantoufloche
of
the
pantouflochade
!
''
He
had
singular
*NL*
freaks
of
tranquillity
;
he
had
himself
shaved
every
day
by
a
barber
who
*NL*
had
been
mad
and
who
detested
him
,
being
jealous
of
M.
Gillenormand
on
*NL*
account
of
his
wife
,
a
pretty
and
coquettish
barberess
.
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
admired
his
own
discernment
in
all
things
,
and
declared
that
he
was
*NL*
extremely
sagacious
;
here
is
one
of
his
sayings
:
``
I
have
,
in
truth
,
some
*NL*
penetration
;
I
am
able
to
say
when
a
flea
bites
me
,
from
what
woman
it
*NL*
came
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
which
he
uttered
the
most
frequently
were
:
the
sensible
man
,
*NL*
and
nature
.
He
did
not
give
to
this
last
word
the
grand
acceptation
*NL*
which
our
epoch
has
accorded
to
it
,
but
he
made
it
enter
,
after
his
own
*NL*
fashion
,
into
his
little
chimney-corner
satires
:
``
Nature
,
''
he
said
,
``
in
*NL*
order
that
civilization
may
have
a
little
of
everything
,
gives
it
even
*NL*
specimens
of
its
amusing
barbarism
.
Europe
possesses
specimens
of
Asia
*NL*
and
Africa
on
a
small
scale
.
The
cat
is
a
drawing-room
tiger
,
the
lizard
*NL*
is
a
pocket
crocodile
.
The
dancers
at
the
opera
are
pink
female
savages
.
*NL*
They
do
not
eat
men
,
they
crunch
them
;
or
,
magicians
that
they
are
,
they
*NL*
transform
them
into
oysters
and
swallow
them
.
The
Caribbeans
leave
only
*NL*
the
bones
,
they
leave
only
the
shell
.
Such
are
our
morals
.
We
do
not
*NL*
devour
,
we
gnaw
;
we
do
not
exterminate
,
we
claw
.

CHAPTER
II
--
LIKE
MASTER
,
LIKE
HOUSE
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
in
the
Marais
,
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
No.
6
.
He
owned
the
*NL*
house
.
This
house
has
since
been
demolished
and
rebuilt
,
and
the
number
*NL*
has
probably
been
changed
in
those
revolutions
of
numeration
which
the
*NL*
streets
of
Paris
undergo
.
He
occupied
an
ancient
and
vast
apartment
*NL*
on
the
first
floor
,
between
street
and
gardens
,
furnished
to
the
very
*NL*
ceilings
with
great
Gobelins
and
Beauvais
tapestries
representing
*NL*
pastoral
scenes
;
the
subjects
of
the
ceilings
and
the
panels
were
*NL*
repeated
in
miniature
on
the
arm-chairs
.
He
enveloped
his
bed
in
a
vast
,
*NL*
nine-leaved
screen
of
Coromandel
lacquer
.
Long
,
full
curtains
hung
from
*NL*
the
windows
,
and
formed
great
,
broken
folds
that
were
very
magnificent
.
*NL*
The
garden
situated
immediately
under
his
windows
was
attached
to
that
*NL*
one
of
them
which
formed
the
angle
,
by
means
of
a
staircase
twelve
or
*NL*
fifteen
steps
long
,
which
the
old
gentleman
ascended
and
descended
with
*NL*
great
agility
.
In
addition
to
a
library
adjoining
his
chamber
,
he
had
a
*NL*
boudoir
of
which
he
thought
a
great
deal
,
a
gallant
and
elegant
retreat
,
*NL*
with
magnificent
hangings
of
straw
,
with
a
pattern
of
flowers
and
*NL*
fleurs-de-lys
made
on
the
galleys
of
Louis
XIV
.
and
ordered
of
his
*NL*
convicts
by
M.
de
Vivonne
for
his
mistress
.
M.
Gillenormand
had
*NL*
inherited
it
from
a
grim
maternal
great-aunt
,
who
had
died
a
*NL*
centenarian
.
He
had
had
two
wives
.
His
manners
were
something
between
*NL*
those
of
the
courtier
,
which
he
had
never
been
,
and
the
lawyer
,
which
*NL*
he
might
have
been
.
He
was
gay
,
and
caressing
when
he
had
a
mind
.
In
*NL*
his
youth
he
had
been
one
of
those
men
who
are
always
deceived
by
their
*NL*
wives
and
never
by
their
mistresses
,
because
they
are
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
the
most
sullen
of
husbands
and
the
most
charming
of
lovers
in
*NL*
existence
.
He
was
a
connoisseur
of
painting
.
He
had
in
his
chamber
a
*NL*
marvellous
portrait
of
no
one
knows
whom
,
painted
by
Jordaens
,
executed
*NL*
with
great
dashes
of
the
brush
,
with
millions
of
details
,
in
a
confused
*NL*
and
hap-hazard
manner
.
M.
Gillenormand
's
attire
was
not
the
habit
of
*NL*
Louis
XIV
.
nor
yet
that
of
Louis
XVI.
;
it
was
that
of
the
Incroyables
*NL*
of
the
Directory
.
He
had
thought
himself
young
up
to
that
period
and
*NL*
had
followed
the
fashions
.
His
coat
was
of
light-weight
cloth
with
*NL*
voluminous
revers
,
a
long
swallow-tail
and
large
steel
buttons
.
With
*NL*
this
he
wore
knee-breeches
and
buckle
shoes
.
He
always
thrust
his
hands
*NL*
into
his
fobs
.
He
said
authoritatively
:
``
The
French
Revolution
is
a
heap
*NL*
of
blackguards
.

CHAPTER
III
--
LUC-ESPRIT
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
age
of
sixteen
,
one
evening
at
the
opera
,
he
had
had
the
honor
*NL*
to
be
stared
at
through
opera-glasses
by
two
beauties
at
the
same
*NL*
time
--
ripe
and
celebrated
beauties
then
,
and
sung
by
Voltaire
,
the
*NL*
Camargo
and
the
Salle
.
Caught
between
two
fires
,
he
had
beaten
a
heroic
*NL*
retreat
towards
a
little
dancer
,
a
young
girl
named
Nahenry
,
who
was
*NL*
sixteen
like
himself
,
obscure
as
a
cat
,
and
with
whom
he
was
in
love
.
*NL*
He
abounded
in
memories
.
He
was
accustomed
to
exclaim
:
``
How
pretty
she
*NL*
was
--
that
Guimard-Guimardini-Guimardinette
,
the
last
time
I
saw
her
*NL*
at
Longchamps
,
her
hair
curled
in
sustained
sentiments
,
with
her
*NL*
come-and-see
of
turquoises
,
her
gown
of
the
color
of
persons
newly
*NL*
arrived
,
and
her
little
agitation
muff
!
''
He
had
worn
in
his
young
*NL*
manhood
a
waistcoat
of
Nain-Londrin
,
which
he
was
fond
of
talking
about
*NL*
effusively
.
``
I
was
dressed
like
a
Turk
of
the
Levant
Levantin
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
Madame
de
Boufflers
,
having
seen
him
by
chance
when
he
was
twenty
,
had
*NL*
described
him
as
``
a
charming
fool
.
''
He
was
horrified
by
all
the
names
*NL*
which
he
saw
in
politics
and
in
power
,
regarding
them
as
vulgar
and
*NL*
bourgeois
.
He
read
the
journals
,
the
newspapers
,
the
gazettes
as
he
*NL*
said
,
stifling
outbursts
of
laughter
the
while
.
``
Oh
!
''
he
said
,
``
what
*NL*
people
these
are
!
Corbiere
!
Humann
!
Casimir
Perier
!
There
's
a
minister
*NL*
for
you
!
I
can
imagine
this
in
a
journal
:
'M
.
Gillenorman
,
minister
!
'
*NL*
that
would
be
a
farce
.
Well
!
They
are
so
stupid
that
it
would
pass
''
;
he
*NL*
merrily
called
everything
by
its
name
,
whether
decent
or
indecent
,
and
*NL*
did
not
restrain
himself
in
the
least
before
ladies
.
He
uttered
coarse
*NL*
speeches
,
obscenities
,
and
filth
with
a
certain
tranquillity
and
lack
*NL*
of
astonishment
which
was
elegant
.
It
was
in
keeping
with
the
*NL*
unceremoniousness
of
his
century
.
It
is
to
be
noted
that
the
age
of
*NL*
periphrase
in
verse
was
the
age
of
crudities
in
prose
.
His
god-father
*NL*
had
predicted
that
he
would
turn
out
a
man
of
genius
,
and
had
bestowed
*NL*
on
him
these
two
significant
names
:
Luc-Esprit
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
--
A
CENTENARIAN
ASPIRANT
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
taken
prizes
in
his
boyhood
at
the
College
of
Moulins
,
where
he
*NL*
was
born
,
and
he
had
been
crowned
by
the
hand
of
the
Duc
de
Nivernais
,
*NL*
whom
he
called
the
Duc
de
Nevers
.
Neither
the
Convention
,
nor
the
death
*NL*
of
Louis
XVI.
,
nor
the
Napoleon
,
nor
the
return
of
the
Bourbons
,
nor
*NL*
anything
else
had
been
able
to
efface
the
memory
of
this
crowning
.
The
*NL*
Duc
de
Nevers
was
,
in
his
eyes
,
the
great
figure
of
the
century
.
``
What
a
*NL*
charming
grand
seigneur
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
what
a
fine
air
he
had
with
his
*NL*
blue
ribbon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
eyes
of
M.
Gillenormand
,
Catherine
the
Second
had
made
reparation
*NL*
for
the
crime
of
the
partition
of
Poland
by
purchasing
,
for
three
*NL*
thousand
roubles
,
the
secret
of
the
elixir
of
gold
,
from
Bestucheff
.
He
*NL*
grew
animated
on
this
subject
:
``
The
elixir
of
gold
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
the
*NL*
yellow
dye
of
Bestucheff
,
General
Lamotte
's
drops
,
in
the
eighteenth
*NL*
century
,
--
this
was
the
great
remedy
for
the
catastrophes
of
love
,
the
*NL*
panacea
against
Venus
,
at
one
louis
the
half-ounce
phial
.
Louis
XV
.
*NL*
sent
two
hundred
phials
of
it
to
the
Pope
.
''
He
would
have
been
greatly
*NL*
irritated
and
thrown
off
his
balance
,
had
any
one
told
him
that
the
*NL*
elixir
of
gold
is
nothing
but
the
perchloride
of
iron
.
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
adored
the
Bourbons
,
and
had
a
horror
of
1789
;
he
was
forever
narrating
*NL*
in
what
manner
he
had
saved
himself
during
the
Terror
,
and
how
he
had
*NL*
been
obliged
to
display
a
vast
deal
of
gayety
and
cleverness
in
order
to
*NL*
escape
having
his
head
cut
off
.
If
any
young
man
ventured
to
pronounce
*NL*
an
eulogium
on
the
Republic
in
his
presence
,
he
turned
purple
and
grew
*NL*
so
angry
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
swooning
.
He
sometimes
alluded
to
*NL*
his
ninety
years
,
and
said
,
``
I
hope
that
I
shall
not
see
ninety-three
*NL*
twice
.
''
On
these
occasions
,
he
hinted
to
people
that
he
meant
to
live
to
*NL*
be
a
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
V
--
BASQUE
AND
NICOLETTE
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
theories
.
Here
is
one
of
them
:
``
When
a
man
is
passionately
fond
*NL*
of
women
,
and
when
he
has
himself
a
wife
for
whom
he
cares
but
little
,
*NL*
who
is
homely
,
cross
,
legitimate
,
with
plenty
of
rights
,
perched
on
the
*NL*
code
,
and
jealous
at
need
,
there
is
but
one
way
of
extricating
himself
*NL*
from
the
quandry
and
of
procuring
peace
,
and
that
is
to
let
his
wife
*NL*
control
the
purse-strings
.
This
abdication
sets
him
free
.
Then
his
*NL*
wife
busies
herself
,
grows
passionately
fond
of
handling
coin
,
gets
her
*NL*
fingers
covered
with
verdigris
in
the
process
,
undertakes
the
education
*NL*
of
half-share
tenants
and
the
training
of
farmers
,
convokes
lawyers
,
*NL*
presides
over
notaries
,
harangues
scriveners
,
visits
limbs
of
the
law
,
*NL*
follows
lawsuits
,
draws
up
leases
,
dictates
contracts
,
feels
herself
the
*NL*
sovereign
,
sells
,
buys
,
regulates
,
promises
and
compromises
,
binds
fast
*NL*
and
annuls
,
yields
,
concedes
and
retrocedes
,
arranges
,
disarranges
,
*NL*
hoards
,
lavishes
;
she
commits
follies
,
a
supreme
and
personal
delight
,
*NL*
and
that
consoles
her
.
While
her
husband
disdains
her
,
she
has
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
ruining
her
husband
.
''
This
theory
M.
Gillenormand
had
*NL*
himself
applied
,
and
it
had
become
his
history
.
His
wife
--
the
second
*NL*
one
--
had
administered
his
fortune
in
such
a
manner
that
,
one
fine
day
,
*NL*
when
M.
Gillenormand
found
himself
a
widower
,
there
remained
to
him
just
*NL*
sufficient
to
live
on
,
by
sinking
nearly
the
whole
of
it
in
an
annuity
*NL*
of
fifteen
thousand
francs
,
three-quarters
of
which
would
expire
with
*NL*
him
.
He
had
not
hesitated
on
this
point
,
not
being
anxious
to
leave
*NL*
a
property
behind
him
.
Besides
,
he
had
noticed
that
patrimonies
are
*NL*
subject
to
adventures
,
and
,
for
instance
,
become
national
property
;
he
*NL*
had
been
present
at
the
avatars
of
consolidated
three
per
cents
,
and
he
*NL*
had
no
great
faith
in
the
Great
Book
of
the
Public
Debt
.
``
All
that
's
*NL*
the
Rue
Quincampois
!
''
he
said
.
His
house
in
the
Rue
Filles-du-Clavaire
*NL*
belonged
to
him
,
as
we
have
already
stated
.
He
had
two
servants
,
``
a
male
*NL*
and
a
female
.
''
When
a
servant
entered
his
establishment
,
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
re-baptized
him
.
He
bestowed
on
the
men
the
name
of
their
province
:
*NL*
Nimois
,
Comtois
,
Poitevin
,
Picard
.
His
last
valet
was
a
big
,
foundered
,
*NL*
short-winded
fellow
of
fifty-five
,
who
was
incapable
of
running
twenty
*NL*
paces
;
but
,
as
he
had
been
born
at
Bayonne
,
M.
Gillenormand
called
him
*NL*
Basque
.
All
the
female
servants
in
his
house
were
called
Nicolette
-LRB-
even
*NL*
the
Magnon
,
of
whom
we
shall
hear
more
farther
on
-RRB-
.
One
day
,
a
haughty
*NL*
cook
,
a
cordon
bleu
,
of
the
lofty
race
of
porters
,
presented
herself
.
*NL*
``
How
much
wages
do
you
want
a
month
?
''
asked
M.
Gillenormand
.
``
Thirty
*NL*
francs
.
''
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
``
Olympie
.
''
``
You
shall
have
fifty
francs
,
*NL*
and
you
shall
be
called
Nicolette
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
IN
WHICH
MAGNON
AND
HER
TWO
CHILDREN
ARE
SEEN
*NL*
*NL*
With
M.
Gillenormand
,
sorrow
was
converted
into
wrath
;
he
was
furious
at
*NL*
being
in
despair
.
He
had
all
sorts
of
prejudices
and
took
all
sorts
*NL*
of
liberties
.
One
of
the
facts
of
which
his
exterior
relief
and
his
*NL*
internal
satisfaction
was
composed
,
was
,
as
we
have
just
hinted
,
that
he
*NL*
had
remained
a
brisk
spark
,
and
that
he
passed
energetically
for
such
.
*NL*
This
he
called
having
``
royal
renown
.
''
This
royal
renown
sometimes
drew
*NL*
down
upon
him
singular
windfalls
.
One
day
,
there
was
brought
to
him
in
*NL*
a
basket
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
basket
of
oysters
,
a
stout
,
newly
*NL*
born
boy
,
who
was
yelling
like
the
deuce
,
and
duly
wrapped
in
*NL*
swaddling-clothes
,
which
a
servant-maid
,
dismissed
six
months
*NL*
previously
,
attributed
to
him
.
M.
Gillenormand
had
,
at
that
time
,
*NL*
fully
completed
his
eighty-fourth
year
.
Indignation
and
uproar
in
the
*NL*
establishment
.
And
whom
did
that
bold
hussy
think
she
could
persuade
to
*NL*
believe
that
?
What
audacity
!
What
an
abominable
calumny
!
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
himself
was
not
at
all
enraged
.
He
gazed
at
the
brat
with
the
amiable
*NL*
smile
of
a
good
man
who
is
flattered
by
the
calumny
,
and
said
in
an
*NL*
aside
:
``
Well
,
what
now
?
What
's
the
matter
?
You
are
finely
taken
aback
,
*NL*
and
really
,
you
are
excessively
ignorant
.
M.
le
Duc
d'Angouleme
,
the
*NL*
bastard
of
his
Majesty
Charles
IX.
,
married
a
silly
jade
of
fifteen
*NL*
when
he
was
eighty-five
;
M.
Virginal
,
Marquis
d'Alluye
,
brother
to
*NL*
the
Cardinal
de
Sourdis
,
Archbishop
of
Bordeaux
,
had
,
at
the
age
of
*NL*
eighty-three
,
by
the
maid
of
Madame
la
Presidente
Jacquin
,
a
son
,
a
*NL*
real
child
of
love
,
who
became
a
Chevalier
of
Malta
and
a
counsellor
of
*NL*
state
;
one
of
the
great
men
of
this
century
,
the
Abbe
Tabaraud
,
is
the
*NL*
son
of
a
man
of
eighty-seven
.
There
is
nothing
out
of
the
ordinary
in
*NL*
these
things
.
And
then
,
the
Bible
!
Upon
that
I
declare
that
this
little
*NL*
gentleman
is
none
of
mine
.
Let
him
be
taken
care
of
.
It
is
not
his
*NL*
fault
.
''
This
manner
of
procedure
was
good-tempered
.
The
woman
,
whose
*NL*
name
was
Magnon
,
sent
him
another
parcel
in
the
following
year
.
It
was
a
*NL*
boy
again
.
Thereupon
,
M.
Gillenormand
capitulated
.
He
sent
the
two
brats
*NL*
back
to
their
mother
,
promising
to
pay
eighty
francs
a
month
for
their
*NL*
maintenance
,
on
the
condition
that
the
said
mother
would
not
do
so
any
*NL*
more
.
He
added
:
``
I
insist
upon
it
that
the
mother
shall
treat
them
well
.
*NL*
I
shall
go
to
see
them
from
time
to
time
.
''
And
this
he
did
.
He
had
had
*NL*
a
brother
who
was
a
priest
,
and
who
had
been
rector
of
the
Academy
of
*NL*
Poitiers
for
three
and
thirty
years
,
and
had
died
at
seventy-nine
.
*NL*
``
I
lost
him
young
,
''
said
he
.
This
brother
,
of
whom
but
little
memory
*NL*
remains
,
was
a
peaceable
miser
,
who
,
being
a
priest
,
thought
himself
*NL*
bound
to
bestow
alms
on
the
poor
whom
he
met
,
but
he
never
gave
them
*NL*
anything
except
bad
or
demonetized
sous
,
thereby
discovering
a
means
of
*NL*
going
to
hell
by
way
of
paradise
.
As
for
M.
Gillenormand
the
elder
,
he
*NL*
never
haggled
over
his
alms-giving
,
but
gave
gladly
and
nobly
.
He
was
*NL*
kindly
,
abrupt
,
charitable
,
and
if
he
had
been
rich
,
his
turn
of
mind
*NL*
would
have
been
magnificent
.
He
desired
that
all
which
concerned
him
*NL*
should
be
done
in
a
grand
manner
,
even
his
rogueries
.
One
day
,
having
*NL*
been
cheated
by
a
business
man
in
a
matter
of
inheritance
,
in
a
gross
*NL*
and
apparent
manner
,
he
uttered
this
solemn
exclamation
:
``
That
was
*NL*
indecently
done
!
I
am
really
ashamed
of
this
pilfering
.
Everything
has
*NL*
degenerated
in
this
century
,
even
the
rascals
.
Morbleu
!
this
is
not
the
*NL*
way
to
rob
a
man
of
my
standing
.
I
am
robbed
as
though
in
a
forest
,
but
*NL*
badly
robbed
.
Silva
,
sint
consule
dignae
!
''
He
had
had
two
wives
,
as
*NL*
we
have
already
mentioned
;
by
the
first
he
had
had
a
daughter
,
who
had
*NL*
remained
unmarried
,
and
by
the
second
another
daughter
,
who
had
died
*NL*
at
about
the
age
of
thirty
,
who
had
wedded
,
through
love
,
or
chance
,
*NL*
or
otherwise
,
a
soldier
of
fortune
who
had
served
in
the
armies
of
the
*NL*
Republic
and
of
the
Empire
,
who
had
won
the
cross
at
Austerlitz
and
had
*NL*
been
made
colonel
at
Waterloo
.
``
He
is
the
disgrace
of
my
family
,
''
*NL*
said
the
old
bourgeois
.
He
took
an
immense
amount
of
snuff
,
and
had
a
*NL*
particularly
graceful
manner
of
plucking
at
his
lace
ruffle
with
the
*NL*
back
of
one
hand
.
He
believed
very
little
in
God
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
RULE
:
RECEIVE
NO
ONE
EXCEPT
IN
THE
EVENING
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
M.
Luc-Esprit
Gillenormand
,
who
had
not
lost
his
hair
,
--
which
*NL*
was
gray
rather
than
white
,
--
and
which
was
always
dressed
in
``
dog
's
*NL*
ears
.
''
To
sum
up
,
he
was
venerable
in
spite
of
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
something
of
the
eighteenth
century
about
him
;
frivolous
and
*NL*
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1814
and
during
the
early
years
of
the
Restoration
,
M.
Gillenormand
,
*NL*
who
was
still
young
,
--
he
was
only
seventy-four
,
--
lived
in
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint
Germain
,
Rue
Servandoni
,
near
Saint-Sulpice
.
He
had
only
retired
*NL*
to
the
Marais
when
he
quitted
society
,
long
after
attaining
the
age
of
*NL*
eighty
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
on
abandoning
society
,
he
had
immured
himself
in
his
habits
.
The
*NL*
principal
one
,
and
that
which
was
invariable
,
was
to
keep
his
door
*NL*
absolutely
closed
during
the
day
,
and
never
to
receive
any
one
whatever
*NL*
except
in
the
evening
.
He
dined
at
five
o'clock
,
and
after
that
his
door
*NL*
was
open
.
That
had
been
the
fashion
of
his
century
,
and
he
would
not
*NL*
swerve
from
it
.
``
The
day
is
vulgar
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
deserves
only
a
*NL*
closed
shutter
.
Fashionable
people
only
light
up
their
minds
when
the
*NL*
zenith
lights
up
its
stars
.
''
And
he
barricaded
himself
against
every
*NL*
one
,
even
had
it
been
the
king
himself
.
This
was
the
antiquated
elegance
*NL*
of
his
day
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
TWO
DO
NOT
MAKE
A
PAIR
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
just
spoken
of
M.
Gillenormand
's
two
daughters
.
They
had
come
*NL*
into
the
world
ten
years
apart
.
In
their
youth
they
had
borne
very
*NL*
little
resemblance
to
each
other
,
either
in
character
or
countenance
,
*NL*
and
had
also
been
as
little
like
sisters
to
each
other
as
possible
.
The
*NL*
youngest
had
a
charming
soul
,
which
turned
towards
all
that
belongs
to
*NL*
the
light
,
was
occupied
with
flowers
,
with
verses
,
with
music
,
which
*NL*
fluttered
away
into
glorious
space
,
enthusiastic
,
ethereal
,
and
was
*NL*
wedded
from
her
very
youth
,
in
ideal
,
to
a
vague
and
heroic
figure
.
The
*NL*
elder
had
also
her
chimera
;
she
espied
in
the
azure
some
very
wealthy
*NL*
purveyor
,
a
contractor
,
a
splendidly
stupid
husband
,
a
million
made
man
,
*NL*
or
even
a
prefect
;
the
receptions
of
the
Prefecture
,
an
usher
in
the
*NL*
antechamber
with
a
chain
on
his
neck
,
official
balls
,
the
harangues
*NL*
of
the
town-hall
,
to
be
``
Madame
la
Prefete
,
''
--
all
this
had
created
a
*NL*
whirlwind
in
her
imagination
.
Thus
the
two
sisters
strayed
,
each
in
her
*NL*
own
dream
,
at
the
epoch
when
they
were
young
girls
.
Both
had
wings
,
the
*NL*
one
like
an
angel
,
the
other
like
a
goose
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
ambition
is
ever
fully
realized
,
here
below
at
least
.
No
paradise
*NL*
becomes
terrestrial
in
our
day
.
The
younger
wedded
the
man
of
her
*NL*
dreams
,
but
she
died
.
The
elder
did
not
marry
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
she
makes
her
entrance
into
this
history
which
we
are
*NL*
relating
,
she
was
an
antique
virtue
,
an
incombustible
prude
,
with
one
of
*NL*
the
sharpest
noses
,
and
one
of
the
most
obtuse
minds
that
it
is
possible
*NL*
to
see
.
A
characteristic
detail
;
outside
of
her
immediate
family
,
no
one
*NL*
had
ever
known
her
first
name
.
She
was
called
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
,
*NL*
the
elder
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
matter
of
cant
,
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
could
have
given
points
*NL*
to
a
miss
.
Her
modesty
was
carried
to
the
other
extreme
of
blackness
.
*NL*
She
cherished
a
frightful
memory
of
her
life
;
one
day
,
a
man
had
beheld
*NL*
her
garter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Age
had
only
served
to
accentuate
this
pitiless
modesty
.
Her
guimpe
was
*NL*
never
sufficiently
opaque
,
and
never
ascended
sufficiently
high
.
She
*NL*
multiplied
clasps
and
pins
where
no
one
would
have
dreamed
of
looking
.
*NL*
The
peculiarity
of
prudery
is
to
place
all
the
more
sentinels
in
*NL*
proportion
as
the
fortress
is
the
less
menaced
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
let
him
who
can
explain
these
antique
mysteries
of
*NL*
innocence
,
she
allowed
an
officer
of
the
Lancers
,
her
grand
nephew
,
*NL*
named
Theodule
,
to
embrace
her
without
displeasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
this
favored
Lancer
,
the
label
:
Prude
,
under
which
we
*NL*
have
classed
her
,
suited
her
to
absolute
perfection
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Gillenormand
was
a
sort
of
twilight
soul
.
Prudery
is
a
demi-virtue
and
a
*NL*
demi-vice
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
prudery
she
added
bigotry
,
a
well-assorted
lining
.
She
belonged
*NL*
to
the
society
of
the
Virgin
,
wore
a
white
veil
on
certain
festivals
,
*NL*
mumbled
special
orisons
,
revered
``
the
holy
blood
,
''
venerated
``
the
sacred
*NL*
heart
,
''
remained
for
hours
in
contemplation
before
a
rococo-jesuit
altar
*NL*
in
a
chapel
which
was
inaccessible
to
the
rank
and
file
of
the
faithful
,
*NL*
and
there
allowed
her
soul
to
soar
among
little
clouds
of
marble
,
and
*NL*
through
great
rays
of
gilded
wood
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
chapel
friend
,
an
ancient
virgin
like
herself
,
named
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Vaubois
,
who
was
a
positive
blockhead
,
and
beside
whom
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
had
the
pleasure
of
being
an
eagle
.
Beyond
*NL*
the
Agnus
Dei
and
Ave
Maria
,
Mademoiselle
Vaubois
had
no
knowledge
of
*NL*
anything
except
of
the
different
ways
of
making
preserves
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Vaubois
,
perfect
in
her
style
,
was
the
ermine
of
stupidity
without
a
*NL*
single
spot
of
intelligence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
it
plainly
,
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
had
gained
rather
than
*NL*
lost
as
she
grew
older
.
This
is
the
case
with
passive
natures
.
She
had
*NL*
never
been
malicious
,
which
is
relative
kindness
;
and
then
,
years
wear
*NL*
away
the
angles
,
and
the
softening
which
comes
with
time
had
come
to
*NL*
her
.
She
was
melancholy
with
an
obscure
sadness
of
which
she
did
not
*NL*
herself
know
the
secret
.
There
breathed
from
her
whole
person
the
stupor
*NL*
of
a
life
that
was
finished
,
and
which
had
never
had
a
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
kept
house
for
her
father
.
M.
Gillenormand
had
his
daughter
near
*NL*
him
,
as
we
have
seen
that
Monseigneur
Bienvenu
had
his
sister
with
him
.
*NL*
These
households
comprised
of
an
old
man
and
an
old
spinster
are
not
*NL*
rare
,
and
always
have
the
touching
aspect
of
two
weaknesses
leaning
on
*NL*
each
other
for
support
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
also
in
this
house
,
between
this
elderly
spinster
and
this
*NL*
old
man
,
a
child
,
a
little
boy
,
who
was
always
trembling
and
mute
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
M.
Gillenormand
.
M.
Gillenormand
never
addressed
this
child
*NL*
except
in
a
severe
voice
,
and
sometimes
,
with
uplifted
cane
:
``
Here
,
sir
!
*NL*
rascal
,
scoundrel
,
come
here
!
--
Answer
me
,
you
scamp
!
Just
let
me
see
*NL*
you
,
you
good-for-nothing
!
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
He
idolized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
his
grandson
.
We
shall
meet
with
this
child
again
later
on

CHAPTER
I
--
AN
ANCIENT
SALON
*NL*
*NL*
When
M.
Gillenormand
lived
in
the
Rue
Servandoni
,
he
had
frequented
*NL*
many
very
good
and
very
aristocratic
salons
.
Although
a
bourgeois
,
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
was
received
in
society
.
As
he
had
a
double
measure
of
wit
,
*NL*
in
the
first
place
,
that
which
was
born
with
him
,
and
secondly
,
that
*NL*
which
was
attributed
to
him
,
he
was
even
sought
out
and
made
much
of
.
He
*NL*
never
went
anywhere
except
on
condition
of
being
the
chief
person
there
.
*NL*
There
are
people
who
will
have
influence
at
any
price
,
and
who
will
have
*NL*
other
people
busy
themselves
over
them
;
when
they
can
not
be
oracles
,
*NL*
they
turn
wags
.
M.
Gillenormand
was
not
of
this
nature
;
his
domination
*NL*
in
the
Royalist
salons
which
he
frequented
cost
his
self-respect
*NL*
nothing
.
He
was
an
oracle
everywhere
.
It
had
happened
to
him
to
hold
his
*NL*
own
against
M.
de
Bonald
,
and
even
against
M.
Bengy-Puy-Vallee
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
1817
,
he
invariably
passed
two
afternoons
a
week
in
a
house
in
*NL*
his
own
neighborhood
,
in
the
Rue
Ferou
,
with
Madame
la
Baronne
de
T.
,
*NL*
a
worthy
and
respectable
person
,
whose
husband
had
been
Ambassador
of
*NL*
France
to
Berlin
under
Louis
XVI
.
Baron
de
T.
,
who
,
during
his
lifetime
,
*NL*
had
gone
very
passionately
into
ecstasies
and
magnetic
visions
,
had
died
*NL*
bankrupt
,
during
the
emigration
,
leaving
,
as
his
entire
fortune
,
*NL*
some
very
curious
Memoirs
about
Mesmer
and
his
tub
,
in
ten
manuscript
*NL*
volumes
,
bound
in
red
morocco
and
gilded
on
the
edges
.
Madame
de
T.
had
*NL*
not
published
the
memoirs
,
out
of
pride
,
and
maintained
herself
on
a
*NL*
meagre
income
which
had
survived
no
one
knew
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
T.
lived
far
from
the
Court
;
``
a
very
mixed
society
,
''
as
she
*NL*
said
,
in
a
noble
isolation
,
proud
and
poor
.
A
few
friends
assembled
*NL*
twice
a
week
about
her
widowed
hearth
,
and
these
constituted
a
purely
*NL*
Royalist
salon
.
They
sipped
tea
there
,
and
uttered
groans
or
cries
of
*NL*
horror
at
the
century
,
the
charter
,
the
Bonapartists
,
the
prostitution
*NL*
of
the
blue
ribbon
,
or
the
Jacobinism
of
Louis
XVIII.
,
according
as
the
*NL*
wind
veered
towards
elegy
or
dithyrambs
;
and
they
spoke
in
low
tones
of
*NL*
the
hopes
which
were
presented
by
Monsieur
,
afterwards
Charles
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
songs
of
the
fishwomen
,
in
which
Napoleon
was
called
Nicolas
,
were
*NL*
received
there
with
transports
of
joy
.
Duchesses
,
the
most
delicate
and
*NL*
charming
women
in
the
world
,
went
into
ecstasies
over
couplets
like
the
*NL*
following
,
addressed
to
``
the
federates
''
:

*NL*
*NL*
There
they
amused
themselves
with
puns
which
were
considered
terrible
,
*NL*
with
innocent
plays
upon
words
which
they
supposed
to
be
venomous
,
with
*NL*
quatrains
,
with
distiches
even
;
thus
,
upon
the
Dessolles
ministry
,
a
*NL*
moderate
cabinet
,
of
which
MM
.
Decazes
and
Deserre
were
members
:

*NL*
*NL*
Or
they
drew
up
a
list
of
the
chamber
of
peers
,
``
an
abominably
Jacobin
*NL*
chamber
,
''
and
from
this
list
they
combined
alliances
of
names
,
in
such
*NL*
a
manner
as
to
form
,
for
example
,
phrases
like
the
following
:
Damas
.
*NL*
Sabran
.
Gouvion-Saint-Cyr
.
--
All
this
was
done
merrily
.
In
that
society
,
*NL*
they
parodied
the
Revolution
.
They
used
I
know
not
what
desires
to
give
*NL*
point
to
the
same
wrath
in
inverse
sense
.
They
sang
their
little
Ca

:

*NL*
Ah

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Songs
are
like
the
guillotine
;
they
chop
away
indifferently
,
to-day
this
*NL*
head
,
to-morrow
that
.
It
is
only
a
variation
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Fualdes
affair
,
which
belongs
to
this
epoch
,
1816
,
they
took
*NL*
part
for
Bastide
and
Jausion
,
because
Fualdes
was
``
a
Buonapartist
.
''
They
*NL*
designated
the
liberals
as
friends
and
brothers
;
this
constituted
the
*NL*
most
deadly
insult
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
certain
church
towers
,
Madame
de
T.
's
salon
had
two
cocks
.
One
of
*NL*
them
was
M.
Gillenormand
,
the
other
was
Comte
de
Lamothe-Valois
,
of
whom
*NL*
it
was
whispered
about
,
with
a
sort
of
respect
:
``
Do
you
know
?
That
is
*NL*
the
Lamothe
of
the
affair
of
the
necklace
.
''
These
singular
amnesties
do
*NL*
occur
in
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
add
the
following
:
in
the
bourgeoisie
,
honored
situations
decay
*NL*
through
too
easy
relations
;
one
must
beware
whom
one
admits
;
in
the
same
*NL*
way
that
there
is
a
loss
of
caloric
in
the
vicinity
of
those
who
are
*NL*
cold
,
there
is
a
diminution
of
consideration
in
the
approach
of
despised
*NL*
persons
.
The
ancient
society
of
the
upper
classes
held
themselves
above
*NL*
this
law
,
as
above
every
other
.
Marigny
,
the
brother
of
the
Pompadour
,
*NL*
had
his
entry
with
M.
le
Prince
de
Soubise
.
In
spite
of
?
No
,
because
.
Du
*NL*
Barry
,
the
god-father
of
the
Vaubernier
,
was
very
welcome
at
the
house
*NL*
of
M.
le
Marechal
de
Richelieu

This

*NL*
the

*NL*
The
Comte
de
Lamothe
,
who
,
in
1815
,
was
an
old
man
seventy-five
years
of
*NL*
age
,
had
nothing
remarkable
about
him
except
his
silent
and
sententious
*NL*
air
,
his
cold
and
angular
face
,
his
perfectly
polished
manners
,
his
coat
*NL*
buttoned
up
to
his
cravat
,
and
his
long
legs
always
crossed
in
long
,
*NL*
flabby
trousers
of
the
hue
of
burnt
sienna
.
His
face
was
the
same
color
*NL*
as
his
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
M.
de
Lamothe
was
``
held
in
consideration
''
in
this
salon
on
account
*NL*
of
his
``
celebrity
''
and
,
strange
to
say
,
though
true
,
because
of
his
name
*NL*
of
Valois
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
M.
Gillenormand
,
his
consideration
was
of
absolutely
first-rate
*NL*
quality
.
He
had
,
in
spite
of
his
levity
,
and
without
its
interfering
in
*NL*
any
way
with
his
dignity
,
a
certain
manner
about
him
which
was
imposing
,
*NL*
dignified
,
honest
,
and
lofty
,
in
a
bourgeois
fashion
;
and
his
great
*NL*
age
added
to
it
.
One
is
not
a
century
with
impunity
.
The
years
finally
*NL*
produce
around
a
head
a
venerable
dishevelment
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
this
,
he
said
things
which
had
the
genuine
sparkle
of
the
*NL*
old
rock
.
Thus
,
when
the
King
of
Prussia
,
after
having
restored
Louis
*NL*
XVIII.
,
came
to
pay
the
latter
a
visit
under
the
name
of
the
Count
de
*NL*
Ruppin
,
he
was
received
by
the
descendant
of
Louis
XIV
.
somewhat
*NL*
as
though
he
had
been
the
Marquis
de
Brandebourg
,
and
with
the
most
*NL*
delicate
impertinence
.
M.
Gillenormand
approved
:
``
All
kings
who
are
*NL*
not
the
King
of
France
,
''
said
he
,
``
are
provincial
kings
.
''
One
day
,
the
*NL*
following
question
was
put
and
the
following
answer
returned
in
his
*NL*
presence
:
``
To
what
was
the
editor
of
the
Courrier
Francais
condemned
?
''
*NL*
``
To
be
suspended
.
''
``
Sus
is
superfluous
,
''
observed
M.
Gillenormand
.

*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Te
Deum
on
the
anniversary
of
the
return
of

,
he
*NL*
said
,
on
seeing
M.

Talleyrand
pass
by
:
``
There
goes
his
Excellency

*NL*
Evil
One
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
was
always
accompanied
by
his
daughter
,
that
tall
*NL*
mademoiselle
,
who
was
over
forty
and
looked
fifty
,
and
by
a
handsome

little
boy
of
seven
years
,
white

rosy

fresh

with
happy
and

in

without
hearing
voices
murmur
*NL*
around
him
:
``
How

What
a

!
Poor

!
''
This
child
*NL*
was
the
one
of
whom
we
dropped
a
word
a
while
ago
.
He
was
called
``
poor

child
,
''
because
he
had
for
a
father
``
a
brigand
of
the
Loire

CHAPTER
II
--
ONE
OF
THE
RED
SPECTRES
OF
THAT
EPOCH
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
had
chanced
to
pass
through
the
little
town
of
Vernon
at
*NL*
this
epoch
,
and
who
had
happened
to
walk
across
that
fine
monumental
*NL*
bridge
,
which
will
soon
be
succeeded
,
let
us
hope
,
by
some
hideous
iron
*NL*
cable
bridge
,
might
have
observed
,
had
he
dropped
his
eyes
over
the
*NL*
parapet
,
a
man
about
fifty
years
of
age
wearing
a
leather
cap
,
and
*NL*
trousers
and
a
waistcoat
of
coarse
gray
cloth
,
to
which
something
yellow
*NL*
which
had
been
a
red
ribbon
,
was
sewn
,
shod
with
wooden
sabots
,
tanned
*NL*
by
the
sun
,
his
face
nearly
black
and
his
hair
nearly
white
,
a
large
*NL*
scar
on
his
forehead
which
ran
down
upon
his
cheek
,
bowed
,
bent
,
*NL*
prematurely
aged
,
who
walked
nearly
every
day
,
hoe
and
sickle
in
hand
,
*NL*
in
one
of
those
compartments
surrounded
by
walls
which
abut
on
the
*NL*
bridge
,
and
border
the
left
bank
of
the
Seine
like
a
chain
of
terraces
,
*NL*
charming
enclosures
full
of
flowers
of
which
one
could
say
,
were
they
*NL*
much
larger
:
``
these
are
gardens
,
''
and
were
they
a
little
smaller
:
``
these
*NL*
are
bouquets
.
''
All
these
enclosures
abut
upon
the
river
at
one
end
,
and
*NL*
on
a
house
at
the
other
.
The
man
in
the
waistcoat
and
the
wooden
shoes
*NL*
of
whom
we
have
just
spoken
,
inhabited
the
smallest
of
these
enclosures
*NL*
and
the
most
humble
of
these
houses
about
1817
.
He
lived
there
alone
and
*NL*
solitary
,
silently
and
poorly
,
with
a
woman
who
was
neither
young
nor
*NL*
old
,
neither
homely
nor
pretty
,
neither
a
peasant
nor
a
bourgeoise
,
who
*NL*
served
him
.
The
plot
of
earth
which
he
called
his
garden
was
celebrated
*NL*
in
the
town
for
the
beauty
of
the
flowers
which
he
cultivated
there
.
*NL*
These
flowers
were
his
occupation
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
labor
,
of
perseverance
,
of
attention
,
and
of
buckets
of
*NL*
water
,
he
had
succeeded
in
creating
after
the
Creator
,
and
he
had
*NL*
invented
certain
tulips
and
certain
dahlias
which
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
forgotten
by
nature
.
He
was
ingenious
;
he
had
forestalled
Soulange
*NL*
Bodin
in
the
formation
of
little
clumps
of
earth
of
heath
mould
,
for
the
*NL*
cultivation
of
rare
and
precious
shrubs
from
America
and
China
.
He
*NL*
was
in
his
alleys
from
the
break
of
day
,
in
summer
,
planting
,
cutting
,
*NL*
hoeing
,
watering
,
walking
amid
his
flowers
with
an
air
of
kindness
,
*NL*
sadness
,
and
sweetness
,
sometimes
standing
motionless
and
thoughtful
*NL*
for
hours
,
listening
to
the
song
of
a
bird
in
the
trees
,
the
babble
of
a
*NL*
child
in
a
house
,
or
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
a
drop
of
dew
at
the
tip
of
*NL*
a
spear
of
grass
,
of
which
the
sun
made
a
carbuncle
.
His
table
was
very
*NL*
plain
,
and
he
drank
more
milk
than
wine
.
A
child
could
make
him
give
*NL*
way
,
and
his
servant
scolded
him
.
He
was
so
timid
that
he
seemed
shy
,
he
*NL*
rarely
went
out
,
and
he
saw
no
one
but
the
poor
people
who
tapped
at
his
*NL*
pane
and
his
cure
,
the
Abbe
Mabeuf
,
a
good
old
man
.
Nevertheless
,
if
the
*NL*
inhabitants
of
the
town
,
or
strangers
,
or
any
chance
comers
,
curious
to
*NL*
see
his
tulips
,
rang
at
his
little
cottage
,
he
opened
his
door
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
He
was
the
``
brigand
of
the
Loire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Any
one
who
had
,
at
the
same
time
,
read
military
memoirs
,
biographies
,
*NL*
the
Moniteur
,
and
the
bulletins
of
the
grand
army
,
would
have
been
*NL*
struck
by
a
name
which
occurs
there
with
tolerable
frequency
,
the
name
*NL*
of
Georges
Pontmercy
.
When
very
young
,
this
Georges
Pontmercy
had
been
*NL*
a
soldier
in
Saintonge
's
regiment
.
The
revolution
broke
out
.
Saintonge
's
*NL*
regiment
formed
a
part
of
the
army
of
the
Rhine
;
for
the
old
regiments
*NL*
of
the
monarchy
preserved
their
names
of
provinces
even
after
the
fall
*NL*
of
the
monarchy
,
and
were
only
divided
into
brigades
in
1794
.
Pontmercy
*NL*
fought
at
Spire
,
at
Worms
,
at
Neustadt
,
at
Turkheim
,
at
Alzey
,
at
*NL*
Mayence
,
where
he
was
one
of
the
two
hundred
who
formed
Houchard
's
*NL*
rearguard
.
It
was
the
twelfth
to
hold
its
ground
against
the
corps
*NL*
of
the
Prince
of
Hesse
,
behind
the
old
rampart
of
Andernach
,
and
only
*NL*
rejoined
the
main
body
of
the
army
when
the
enemy
's
cannon
had
opened
*NL*
a
breach
from
the
cord
of
the
parapet
to
the
foot
of
the
glacis
.
He
was
*NL*
under
Kleber
at
Marchiennes
and
at
the
battle
of
Mont-Palissel
,
where
*NL*
a
ball
from
a
biscaien
broke
his
arm
.
Then
he
passed
to
the
frontier
*NL*
of
Italy
,
and
was
one
of
the
thirty
grenadiers
who
defended
the
Col
*NL*
de
Tende
with
Joubert
.
Joubert
was
appointed
its
adjutant-general
,
and
*NL*
Pontmercy
sub-lieutenant
.
Pontmercy
was
by
Berthier
's
side
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
the
grape-shot
of
that
day
at
Lodi
which
caused
Bonaparte
to
say
:
*NL*
``
Berthier
has
been
cannoneer
,
cavalier
,
and
grenadier
.
''
He
beheld
his
*NL*
old
general
,
Joubert
,
fall
at
Novi
,
at
the
moment
when
,
with
uplifted
*NL*
sabre
,
he
was
shouting
:
``
Forward
!
''
Having
been
embarked
with
his
*NL*
company
in
the
exigencies
of
the
campaign
,
on
board
a
pinnace
which
was
*NL*
proceeding
from
Genoa
to
some
obscure
port
on
the
coast
,
he
fell
into
*NL*
a
wasps
'
-
nest
of
seven
or
eight
English
vessels
.
The
Genoese
commander
*NL*
wanted
to
throw
his
cannon
into
the
sea
,
to
hide
the
soldiers
between
*NL*
decks
,
and
to
slip
along
in
the
dark
as
a
merchant
vessel
.
Pontmercy
had
*NL*
the
colors
hoisted
to
the
peak
,
and
sailed
proudly
past
under
the
guns
*NL*
of
the
British
frigates
.
Twenty
leagues
further
on
,
his
audacity
having
*NL*
increased
,
he
attacked
with
his
pinnace
,
and
captured
a
large
English
*NL*
transport
which
was
carrying
troops
to
Sicily
,
and
which
was
so
loaded
*NL*
down
with
men
and
horses
that
the
vessel
was
sunk
to
the
level
of
the
*NL*
sea
.
In
1805
he
was
in
that
Malher
division
which
took
Gunzberg
from
the
*NL*
Archduke
Ferdinand
.
At
Weltingen
he
received
into
his
arms
,
beneath
a
*NL*
storm
of
bullets
,
Colonel
Maupetit
,
mortally
wounded
at
the
head
of
the
*NL*
9th
Dragoons
.
He
distinguished
himself
at
Austerlitz
in
that
admirable
*NL*
march
in
echelons
effected
under
the
enemy
's
fire
.
When
the
cavalry
of
*NL*
the
Imperial
Russian
Guard
crushed
a
battalion
of
the
4th
of
the
line
,
*NL*
Pontmercy
was
one
of
those
who
took
their
revenge
and
overthrew
the
*NL*
Guard
.
The
Emperor
gave
him
the
cross
.
Pontmercy
saw
Wurmser
at
Mantua
,
*NL*
Melas
,
and
Alexandria
,
Mack
at
Ulm
,
made
prisoners
in
succession
.
*NL*
He
formed
a
part
of
the
eighth
corps
of
the
grand
army
which
Mortier
*NL*
commanded
,
and
which
captured
Hamburg
.
Then
he
was
transferred
to
the
*NL*
55th
of
the
line
,
which
was
the
old
regiment
of
Flanders
.
At
Eylau
*NL*
he
was
in
the
cemetery
where
,
for
the
space
of
two
hours
,
the
heroic
*NL*
Captain
Louis
Hugo
,
the
uncle
of
the
author
of
this
book
,
sustained
*NL*
alone
with
his
company
of
eighty-three
men
every
effort
of
the
hostile
*NL*
army
.
Pontmercy
was
one
of
the
three
who
emerged
alive
from
that
*NL*
cemetery
.
He
was
at
Friedland
.
Then
he
saw
Moscow
.
Then
La
Beresina
,
*NL*
then
Lutzen
,
Bautzen
,
Dresden
,
Wachau
,
Leipzig
,
and
the
defiles
of
*NL*
Gelenhausen
;
then
Montmirail
,
Chateau-Thierry
,
Craon
,
the
banks
of
the
*NL*
Marne
,
the
banks
of
the
Aisne
,
and
the
redoubtable
position
of
Laon
.
At
*NL*
Arnay-Le-Duc
,
being
then
a
captain
,
he
put
ten
Cossacks
to
the
sword
,
*NL*
and
saved
,
not
his
general
,
but
his
corporal
.
He
was
well
slashed
up
on
*NL*
this
occasion
,
and
twenty-seven
splinters
were
extracted
from
his
left
*NL*
arm
alone
.
Eight
days
before
the
capitulation
of
Paris
he
had
just
*NL*
exchanged
with
a
comrade
and
entered
the
cavalry
.
He
had
what
was
called
*NL*
under
the
old
regime
,
the
double
hand
,
that
is
to
say
,
an
equal
aptitude
*NL*
for
handling
the
sabre
or
the
musket
as
a
soldier
,
or
a
squadron
or
*NL*
a
battalion
as
an
officer
.
It
is
from
this
aptitude
,
perfected
by
a
*NL*
military
education
,
which
certain
special
branches
of
the
service
arise
,
*NL*
the
dragoons
,
for
example
,
who
are
both
cavalry-men
and
infantry
at
one
*NL*
and
the
same
time
.
He
accompanied
Napoleon
to
the
Island
of
Elba
.
At
*NL*
Waterloo
,
he
was
chief
of
a
squadron
of
cuirassiers
,
in
Dubois
'
brigade
.
*NL*
It
was
he
who
captured
the
standard
of
the
Lunenburg
battalion
.
He
came
*NL*
and
cast
the
flag
at
the
Emperor
's
feet
.
He
was
covered
with
blood
.
*NL*
While
tearing
down
the
banner
he
had
received
a
sword-cut
across
his
*NL*
face
.
The
Emperor
,
greatly
pleased
,
shouted
to
him
:
``
You
are
a
colonel
,
*NL*
you
are
a
baron
,
you
are
an
officer
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
!
''
Pontmercy
*NL*
replied
:
``
Sire
,
I
thank
you
for
my
widow
.
''
An
hour
later
,
he
fell
in
the
*NL*
ravine
of
Ohain
.
Now
,
who
was
this
Georges
Pontmercy
?
He
was
this
same
*NL*
``
brigand
of
the
Loire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
seen
something
of
his
history
.
After
Waterloo
,
*NL*
Pontmercy
,
who
had
been
pulled
out
of
the
hollow
road
of
Ohain
,
as
it
*NL*
will
be
remembered
,
had
succeeded
in
joining
the
army
,
and
had
dragged
*NL*
himself
from
ambulance
to
ambulance
as
far
as
the
cantonments
of
the
*NL*
Loire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Restoration
had
placed
him
on
half-pay
,
then
had
sent
him
into
*NL*
residence
,
that
is
to
say
,
under
surveillance
,
at
Vernon
.
King
Louis
*NL*
XVIII.
,
regarding
all
that
which
had
taken
place
during
the
Hundred
*NL*
Days
as
not
having
occurred
at
all
,
did
not
recognize
his
quality
as
an
*NL*
officer
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
,
nor
his
grade
of
colonel
,
nor
his
title
*NL*
of
baron
.
He
,
on
his
side
,
neglected
no
occasion
of
signing
himself
*NL*
``
Colonel
Baron
Pontmercy
.
''
He
had
only
an
old
blue
coat
,
and
he
never
*NL*
went
out
without
fastening
to
it
his
rosette
as
an
officer
of
the
Legion
*NL*
of
Honor
.
The
Attorney
for
the
Crown
had
him
warned
that
the
authorities
*NL*
would
prosecute
him
for
``
illegal
''
wearing
of
this
decoration
.
When
this
*NL*
notice
was
conveyed
to
him
through
an
officious
intermediary
,
Pontmercy
*NL*
retorted
with
a
bitter
smile
:
``
I
do
not
know
whether
I
no
longer
*NL*
understand
French
,
or
whether
you
no
longer
speak
it
;
but
the
fact
is
*NL*
that
I
do
not
understand
.
''
Then
he
went
out
for
eight
successive
days
*NL*
with
his
rosette
.
They
dared
not
interfere
with
him
.
Two
or
three
times
*NL*
the
Minister
of
War
and
the
general
in
command
of
the
department
wrote
*NL*
to
him
with
the
following
address
:
``
A
Monsieur
le
Commandant
Pontmercy
.
''
*NL*
He
sent
back
the
letters
with
the
seals
unbroken
.
At
the
same
moment
,
*NL*
Napoleon
at
Saint
Helena
was
treating
in
the
same
fashion
the
missives
*NL*
of
Sir
Hudson
Lowe
addressed
to
General
Bonaparte
.
Pontmercy
had
ended
,
*NL*
may
we
be
pardoned
the
expression
,
by
having
in
his
mouth
the
same
*NL*
saliva
as
his
Emperor
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
,
there
were
at
Rome
Carthaginian
prisoners
who
refused
*NL*
to
salute
Flaminius
,
and
who
had
a
little
of
Hannibal
's
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
encountered
the
district-attorney
in
one
of
the
streets
of
*NL*
Vernon
,
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
said
:
``
Mr.
Crown
Attorney
,
am
I
permitted
*NL*
to
wear
my
scar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
nothing
save
his
meagre
half-pay
as
chief
of
squadron
.
He
had
*NL*
hired
the
smallest
house
which
he
could
find
at
Vernon
.
He
lived
there
*NL*
alone
,
we
have
just
seen
how
.
Under
the
Empire
,
between
two
wars
,
he
*NL*
had
found
time
to
marry
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
.
The
old
bourgeois
,
*NL*
thoroughly
indignant
at
bottom
,
had
given
his
consent
with
a
sigh
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
The
greatest
families
are
forced
into
it
.
''
In
1815
,
Madame
*NL*
Pontmercy
,
an
admirable
woman
in
every
sense
,
by
the
way
,
lofty
in
*NL*
sentiment
and
rare
,
and
worthy
of
her
husband
,
died
,
leaving
a
*NL*
child
.
This
child
had
been
the
colonel
's
joy
in
his
solitude
;
but
the
*NL*
grandfather
had
imperatively
claimed
his
grandson
,
declaring
that
if
*NL*
the
child
were
not
given
to
him
he
would
disinherit
him
.
The
father
had
*NL*
yielded
in
the
little
one
's
interest
,
and
had
transferred
his
love
to
*NL*
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
had
renounced
everything
,
and
neither
stirred
up
mischief
*NL*
nor
conspired
.
He
shared
his
thoughts
between
the
innocent
things
which
*NL*
he
was
then
doing
and
the
great
things
which
he
had
done
.
He
passed
his
*NL*
time
in
expecting
a
pink
or
in
recalling
Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
kept
up
no
relations
with
his
son-in-law
.
The
colonel
*NL*
was
``
a
bandit
''
to
him
.
M.
Gillenormand
never
mentioned
the
colonel
,
*NL*
except
when
he
occasionally
made
mocking
allusions
to
``
his
Baronship
.
''
*NL*
It
had
been
expressly
agreed
that
Pontmercy
should
never
attempt
to
see
*NL*
his
son
nor
to
speak
to
him
,
under
penalty
of
having
the
latter
handed
*NL*
over
to
him
disowned
and
disinherited
.
For
the
Gillenormands
,
Pontmercy
*NL*
was
a
man
afflicted
with
the
plague
.
They
intended
to
bring
up
the
*NL*
child
in
their
own
way
.
Perhaps
the
colonel
was
wrong
to
accept
these
*NL*
conditions
,
but
he
submitted
to
them
,
thinking
that
he
was
doing
right
*NL*
and
sacrificing
no
one
but
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inheritance
of
Father
Gillenormand
did
not
amount
to
much
;
but
the
*NL*
inheritance
of
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
the
elder
was
considerable
.
*NL*
This
aunt
,
who
had
remained
unmarried
,
was
very
rich
on
the
maternal
*NL*
side
,
and
her
sister
's
son
was
her
natural
heir
.
The
boy
,
whose
name
was
*NL*
Marius
,
knew
that
he
had
a
father
,
but
nothing
more
.
No
one
opened
*NL*
his
mouth
to
him
about
it
.
Nevertheless
,
in
the
society
into
which
his
*NL*
grandfather
took
him
,
whispers
,
innuendoes
,
and
winks
,
had
eventually
*NL*
enlightened
the
little
boy
's
mind
;
he
had
finally
understood
something
*NL*
of
the
case
,
and
as
he
naturally
took
in
the
ideas
and
opinions
which
*NL*
were
,
so
to
speak
,
the
air
he
breathed
,
by
a
sort
of
infiltration
and
*NL*
slow
penetration
,
he
gradually
came
to
think
of
his
father
only
with
*NL*
shame
and
with
a
pain
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
growing
up
in
this
fashion
,
the
colonel
slipped
away
every
*NL*
two
or
three
months
,
came
to
Paris
on
the
sly
,
like
a
criminal
breaking
*NL*
his
ban
,
and
went
and
posted
himself
at
Saint-Sulpice
,
at
the
hour
when
*NL*
Aunt
Gillenormand
led
Marius
to
the
mass
.
There
,
trembling
lest
the
aunt
*NL*
should
turn
round
,
concealed
behind
a
pillar
,
motionless
,
not
daring
to
*NL*
breathe
,
he
gazed
at
his
child
.
The
scarred
veteran
was
afraid
of
that
*NL*
old
spinster
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
had
arisen
his
connection
with
the
cure
of
Vernon
,
M.
l'Abbe
*NL*
Mabeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
worthy
priest
was
the
brother
of
a
warden
of
Saint-Sulpice
,
who
had
*NL*
often
observed
this
man
gazing
at
his
child
,
and
the
scar
on
his
cheek
,
*NL*
and
the
large
tears
in
his
eyes
.
That
man
,
who
had
so
manly
an
air
,
yet
*NL*
who
was
weeping
like
a
woman
,
had
struck
the
warden
.
That
face
had
clung
*NL*
to
his
mind
.
One
day
,
having
gone
to
Vernon
to
see
his
brother
,
he
had
*NL*
encountered
Colonel
Pontmercy
on
the
bridge
,
and
had
recognized
the
man
*NL*
of
Saint-Sulpice
.
The
warden
had
mentioned
the
circumstance
to
the
cure
,
*NL*
and
both
had
paid
the
colonel
a
visit
,
on
some
pretext
or
other
.
This
*NL*
visit
led
to
others
.
The
colonel
,
who
had
been
extremely
reserved
at
*NL*
first
,
ended
by
opening
his
heart
,
and
the
cure
and
the
warden
finally
*NL*
came
to
know
the
whole
history
,
and
how
Pontmercy
was
sacrificing
his
*NL*
happiness
to
his
child
's
future
.
This
caused
the
cure
to
regard
him
with
*NL*
veneration
and
tenderness
,
and
the
colonel
,
on
his
side
,
became
fond
*NL*
of
the
cure
.
And
moreover
,
when
both
are
sincere
and
good
,
no
men
so
*NL*
penetrate
each
other
,
and
so
amalgamate
with
each
other
,
as
an
old
*NL*
priest
and
an
old
soldier
.
At
bottom
,
the
man
is
the
same
.
The
one
has
*NL*
devoted
his
life
to
his
country
here
below
,
the
other
to
his
country
on
*NL*
high
;
that
is
the
only
difference
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
a
year
,
on
the
first
of
January
and
on
St.
George
's
day
,
Marius
*NL*
wrote
duty
letters
to
his
father
,
which
were
dictated
by
his
aunt
,
and
*NL*
which
one
would
have
pronounced
to
be
copied
from
some
formula
;
this
was
*NL*
all
that
M.
Gillenormand
tolerated
;
and
the
father
answered
them
with
*NL*
very
tender
letters
which
the
grandfather
thrust
into
his
pocket
unread
.

CHAPTER
III
--
REQUIESCANT
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
de
T.
's
salon
was
all
that
Marius
Pontmercy
knew
of
the
world
.
It
*NL*
was
the
only
opening
through
which
he
could
get
a
glimpse
of
life
.
This
*NL*
opening
was
sombre
,
and
more
cold
than
warmth
,
more
night
than
day
,
came
*NL*
to
him
through
this
skylight
.
This
child
,
who
had
been
all
joy
and
light
*NL*
on
entering
this
strange
world
,
soon
became
melancholy
,
and
,
what
is
*NL*
still
more
contrary
to
his
age
,
grave
.
Surrounded
by
all
those
singular
*NL*
and
imposing
personages
,
he
gazed
about
him
with
serious
amazement
.
*NL*
Everything
conspired
to
increase
this
astonishment
in
him
.
There
were
*NL*
in
Madame
de
T.
's
salon
some
very
noble
ladies
named
Mathan
,
Noe
,
*NL*
Levis
,
--
which
was
pronounced
Levi
,
--
Cambis
,
pronounced
Cambyse
.
These
*NL*
antique
visages
and
these
Biblical
names
mingled
in
the
child
's
mind
*NL*
with
the
Old
Testament
which
he
was
learning
by
heart
,
and
when
they
*NL*
were
all
there
,
seated
in
a
circle
around
a
dying
fire
,
sparely
lighted
*NL*
by
a
lamp
shaded
with
green
,
with
their
severe
profiles
,
their
gray
or
*NL*
white
hair
,
their
long
gowns
of
another
age
,
whose
lugubrious
colors
*NL*
could
not
be
distinguished
,
dropping
,
at
rare
intervals
,
words
which
*NL*
were
both
majestic
and
severe
,
little
Marius
stared
at
them
with
*NL*
frightened
eyes
,
in
the
conviction
that
he
beheld
not
women
,
but
*NL*
patriarchs
and
magi
,
not
real
beings
,
but
phantoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
phantoms
,
priests
were
sometimes
mingled
,
frequenters
of
*NL*
this
ancient
salon
,
and
some
gentlemen
;
the
Marquis
de
Sass
****
,
private
*NL*
secretary
to
Madame
de
Berry
,
the
Vicomte
de
Val
***
,
who
published
,
*NL*
under
the
pseudonyme
of
Charles-Antoine
,
monorhymed
odes
,
the
Prince
de
*NL*
Beauff
*******
,
who
,
though
very
young
,
had
a
gray
head
and
a
pretty
and
*NL*
witty
wife
,
whose
very
low-necked
toilettes
of
scarlet
velvet
with
gold
*NL*
torsades
alarmed
these
shadows
,
the
Marquis
de
C
*****
d'
E
******
,
the
man
*NL*
in
all
France
who
best
understood
``
proportioned
politeness
,
''
the
Comte
*NL*
d'Am
*****
,
the
kindly
man
with
the
amiable
chin
,
and
the
Chevalier
de
*NL*
Port-de-Guy
,
a
pillar
of
the
library
of
the
Louvre
,
called
the
King
's
*NL*
cabinet
,
M.
de
Port-de-Guy
,
bald
,
and
rather
aged
than
old
,
was
wont
*NL*
to
relate
that
in
1793
,
at
the
age
of
sixteen
,
he
had
been
put
in
the
*NL*
galleys
as
refractory
and
chained
with
an
octogenarian
,
the
Bishop
*NL*
of
Mirepoix
,
also
refractory
,
but
as
a
priest
,
while
he
was
so
in
the
*NL*
capacity
of
a
soldier
.
This
was
at
Toulon
.
Their
business
was
to
go
at
*NL*
night
and
gather
up
on
the
scaffold
the
heads
and
bodies
of
the
persons
*NL*
who
had
been
guillotined
during
the
day
;
they
bore
away
on
their
backs
*NL*
these
dripping
corpses
,
and
their
red
galley-slave
blouses
had
a
clot
of
*NL*
blood
at
the
back
of
the
neck
,
which
was
dry
in
the
morning
and
wet
at
*NL*
night
.
These
tragic
tales
abounded
in
Madame
de
T.
's
salon
,
and
by
*NL*
dint
of
cursing
Marat
,
they
applauded
Trestaillon
.
Some
deputies
of
the
*NL*
undiscoverable
variety
played
their
whist
there
;
M.
Thibord
du
Chalard
,
*NL*
M.
Lemarchant
de
Gomicourt
,
and
the
celebrated
scoffer
of
the
right
,
M.
*NL*
Cornet-Dincourt
.
The
bailiff
de
Ferrette
,
with
his
short
breeches
*NL*
and
his
thin
legs
,
sometimes
traversed
this
salon
on
his
way
to
M.
de
*NL*
Talleyrand
.
He
had
been
M.
le
Comte
d'Artois
'
companion
in
pleasures
and
*NL*
unlike
Aristotle
crouching
under
Campaspe
,
he
had
made
the
Guimard
crawl
*NL*
on
all
fours
,
and
in
that
way
he
had
exhibited
to
the
ages
a
philosopher
*NL*
avenged
by
a
bailiff
.
As
for
the
priests
,
there
was
the
Abbe
Halma
,
the
*NL*
same
to
whom
M.
Larose
,
his
collaborator
on
la
Foudre
,
said
:
``
Bah
!
Who
*NL*
is
there
who
is
not
fifty
years
old
?
a
few
greenhorns
perhaps
?
''
The
Abbe
*NL*
Letourneur
,
preacher
to
the
King
,
the
Abbe
Frayssinous
,
who
was
not
,
as
*NL*
yet
,
either
count
,
or
bishop
,
or
minister
,
or
peer
,
and
who
wore
an
old
*NL*
cassock
whose
buttons
were
missing
,
and
the
Abbe
Keravenant
,
Cure
of
*NL*
Saint-Germain-des-Pres
;
also
the
Pope
's
Nuncio
,
then
Monsignor
Macchi
,
*NL*
Archbishop
of
Nisibi
,
later
on
Cardinal
,
remarkable
for
his
long
,
*NL*
pensive
nose
,
and
another
Monsignor
,
entitled
thus
:
Abbate
Palmieri
,
*NL*
domestic
prelate
,
one
of
the
seven
participant
prothonotaries
of
the
*NL*
Holy
See
,
Canon
of
the
illustrious
Liberian
basilica
,
Advocate
of
the
*NL*
saints
,
Postulatore
dei

which
refers
to
matters
of
canonization
,
*NL*
and
signifies
very
nearly
:
Master
of
Requests
of
the
section
of

Paradise
.
Lastly
,
two
cardinals
,
M.
de
la
Luzerne
,
and
M.
de
Cl

*NL*
T
*******
.
The
Cardinal
of
Luzerne
was
a
writer
and
was
destined
to
have
,
*NL*
a
few
years
later
,
the
honor
of
signing
in
the
Conservateur
articles
*NL*
side
by
side
with
Chateaubriand
;
M.
de
Cl
******
T
*******
was
Archbishop
*NL*
of
Toul
****
,
and
often
made
trips
to
Paris
,
to
his
nephew
,
the
Marquis
*NL*
de
T
*******
,
who
was
Minister
of
Marine
and
War
.
The
Cardinal
of
*NL*
Cl
******
T
*******
was
a
merry
little
man
,
who
displayed
his
red
*NL*
stockings
beneath
his
tucked-up
cassock
;
his
specialty
was
a
hatred
of
*NL*
the
Encyclopaedia
,
and
his
desperate
play
at
billiards
,
and
persons
who
,
*NL*
at
that
epoch
,
passed
through
the
Rue
M
*****
on
summer
evenings
,
where
*NL*
the
hotel
de
Cl
******
T
*******
then
stood
,
halted
to
listen
to
the
shock
*NL*
of
the
balls
and
the
piercing
voice
of
the
Cardinal
shouting
to
his
*NL*
conclavist
,
Monseigneur
Cotiret
,
Bishop
in
partibus
of
Caryste
:
``
Mark
,
*NL*
Abbe
,
I
make
a
cannon

''
The
Cardinal
de
Cl
******
T
*******
had
been
*NL*
brought
to
Madame
de
T.
's
by
his
most
intimate
friend
,
M.
de
Roquelaure
,
*NL*
former
Bishop
of
Senlis
,
and
one
of
the
Forty
.
M.
de
Roquelaure
was
*NL*
notable
for
his
lofty
figure
and
his
assiduity
at
the
Academy
;
through
*NL*
the
glass
door
of
the
neighboring
hall
of
the
library
where
the
French
*NL*
Academy
then
held
its
meetings
,
the
curious
could
,
on
every
Tuesday
,
*NL*
contemplate
the
Ex-Bishop
of
Senlis
,
usually
standing
erect
,
freshly
*NL*
powdered
,
in
violet
hose
,
with
his
back
turned
to
the
door
,
apparently
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
allowing
a
better
view
of
his
little
collar
.
All
*NL*
these
ecclesiastics
,
though
for
the
most
part
as
much
courtiers
as
*NL*
churchmen
,
added
to
the
gravity
of
the
T.
salon
,
whose
seigniorial
*NL*
aspect
was
accentuated
by
five
peers
of
France
,
the
Marquis
de
Vib
****
,
*NL*
the
Marquis
de
Tal
***
,
the
Marquis
de
Herb
*******
,
the
Vicomte
Damb
***
,
*NL*
and
the
Duc
de
Val
********
.
This
Duc
de
Val
********
,
although
Prince
de
*NL*
Mon
***
,
that
is
to
say
a
reigning
prince
abroad
,
had
so
high
an
idea
of
*NL*
France
and
its
peerage
,
that
he
viewed
everything
through
their
medium
.
*NL*
It
was
he
who
said
:
``
The
Cardinals
are
the
peers
of
France
of
Rome
;
*NL*
the
lords
are
the
peers
of
France
of
England
.
''
Moreover
,
as
it
is
*NL*
indispensable
that
the
Revolution
should
be
everywhere
in
this
century
,
*NL*
this
feudal
salon
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
dominated
by
a
bourgeois
.
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
reigned
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
lay
the
essence
and
quintessence
of
the
Parisian
white
society
.
*NL*
There
reputations
,
even
Royalist
reputations
,
were
held
in
quarantine
.
*NL*
There
is
always
a
trace
of
anarchy
in
renown
.
Chateaubriand
,
had
he
*NL*
entered
there
,
would
have
produced
the
effect
of
Pere
Duchene
.
Some
of
*NL*
the
scoffed-at
did
,
nevertheless
,
penetrate
thither
on
sufferance
.
Comte
*NL*
Beug
***
was
received
there
,
subject
to
correction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
noble
''
salons
of
the
present
day
no
longer
resemble
those
salons
.
*NL*
The
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
reeks
of
the
fagot
even
now
.
The
Royalists
of
*NL*
to-day
are
demagogues
,
let
us
record
it
to
their
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Madame
de
T.
's
the
society
was
superior
,
taste
was
exquisite
and
*NL*
haughty
,
under
the
cover
of
a
great
show
of
politeness
.
Manners
there
*NL*
admitted
of
all
sorts
of
involuntary
refinements
which
were
the
old
*NL*
regime
itself
,
buried
but
still
alive
.
Some
of
these
habits
,
especially
*NL*
in
the
matter
of
language
,
seem
eccentric
.
Persons
but
superficially
*NL*
acquainted
with
them
would
have
taken
for
provincial
that
which
was
only
*NL*
antique
.
A
woman
was
called
Madame
la
Generale
.
Madame
la
Colonelle
was
*NL*
not
entirely
disused
.
The
charming
Madame
de
Leon
,
in
memory
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
of
the
Duchesses
de
Longueville
and
de
Chevreuse
,
preferred
this
*NL*
appellation
to
her
title
of
Princesse
.
The
Marquise
de
Crequy
was
also
*NL*
called
Madame
la
Colonelle
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
this
little
high
society
which
invented
at
the
Tuileries
the
*NL*
refinement
of
speaking
to
the
King
in
private
as
the
King
,
in
the
third
*NL*
person
,
and
never
as
Your
Majesty
,
the
designation
of
Your
Majesty
*NL*
having
been
``
soiled
by
the
usurper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Men
and
deeds
were
brought
to
judgment
there
.
They
jeered
at
the
age
,
*NL*
which
released
them
from
the
necessity
of
understanding
it
.
They
abetted
*NL*
each
other
in
amazement
.
They
communicated
to
each
other
that
modicum
*NL*
of
light
which
they
possessed
.
Methuselah
bestowed
information
on
*NL*
Epimenides
.
The
deaf
man
made
the
blind
man
acquainted
with
the
course
*NL*
of
things
.
They
declared
that
the
time
which
had
elasped
since
Coblentz
*NL*
had
not
existed
.
In
the
same
manner
that
Louis
XVIII
.
was
by
the
grace
*NL*
of
God
,
in
the
five
and
twentieth
year
of
his
reign
,
the
emigrants
were
,
*NL*
by
rights
,
in
the
five
and
twentieth
year
of
their
adolescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
harmonious
;
nothing
was
too
much
alive
;
speech
hardly
amounted
*NL*
to
a
breath
;
the
newspapers
,
agreeing
with
the
salons
,
seemed
a
papyrus
.
*NL*
There
were
some
young
people
,
but
they
were
rather
dead
.
The
liveries
in
*NL*
the
antechamber
were
antiquated
.
These
utterly
obsolete
personages
were
*NL*
served
by
domestics
of
the
same
stamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
had
the
air
of
having
lived
a
long
time
ago
,
and
of
obstinately
*NL*
resisting
the
sepulchre
.
Nearly
the
whole
dictionary
consisted
of
*NL*
Conserver
,
Conservation
,
Conservateur
;
to
be
in
good
odor
,
--
that
was
the
*NL*
point
.
There
are
,
in
fact
,
aromatics
in
the
opinions
of
these
venerable
*NL*
groups
,
and
their
ideas
smelled
of
it
.
It
was
a
mummified
society
.
The
*NL*
masters
were
embalmed
,
the
servants
were
stuffed
with
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
worthy
old
marquise
,
an
emigree
and
ruined
,
who
had
but
a
solitary
*NL*
maid
,
continued
to
say
:
``
My
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
they
do
in
Madame
de
T.
's
salon
?
They
were
ultra
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
ultra
;
this
word
,
although
what
it
represents
may
not
have
*NL*
disappeared
,
has
no
longer
any
meaning
at
the
present
day
.
Let
us
*NL*
explain
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
ultra
is
to
go
beyond
.
It
is
to
attack
the
sceptre
in
the
name
of
*NL*
the
throne
,
and
the
mitre
in
the
name
of
the
attar
;
it
is
to
ill-treat
*NL*
the
thing
which
one
is
dragging
,
it
is
to
kick
over
the
traces
;
it
is
*NL*
to
cavil
at
the
fagot
on
the
score
of
the
amount
of
cooking
received
by
*NL*
heretics
;
it
is
to
reproach
the
idol
with
its
small
amount
of
idolatry
;
*NL*
it
is
to
insult
through
excess
of
respect
;
it
is
to
discover
that
the
*NL*
Pope
is
not
sufficiently
papish
,
that
the
King
is
not
sufficiently
*NL*
royal
,
and
that
the
night
has
too
much
light
;
it
is
to
be
discontented
*NL*
with
alabaster
,
with
snow
,
with
the
swan
and
the
lily
in
the
name
of
*NL*
whiteness
;
it
is
to
be
a
partisan
of
things
to
the
point
of
becoming
*NL*
their
enemy
;
it
is
to
be
so
strongly
for
,
as
to
be
against
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ultra
spirit
especially
characterizes
the
first
phase
of
the
*NL*
Restoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
in
history
resembles
that
quarter
of
an
hour
which
begins
in
*NL*
1814
and
terminates
about
1820
,
with
the
advent
of
M.
de
Villele
,
*NL*
the
practical
man
of
the
Right
.
These
six
years
were
an
extraordinary
*NL*
moment
;
at
one
and
the
same
time
brilliant
and
gloomy
,
smiling
and
*NL*
sombre
,
illuminated
as
by
the
radiance
of
dawn
and
entirely
covered
,
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
with
the
shadows
of
the
great
catastrophes
which
still
*NL*
filled
the
horizon
and
were
slowly
sinking
into
the
past
.
There
existed
*NL*
in
that
light
and
that
shadow
,
a
complete
little
new
and
old
world
,
*NL*
comic
and
sad
,
juvenile
and
senile
,
which
was
rubbing
its
eyes
;
nothing
*NL*
resembles
an
awakening
like
a
return
;
a
group
which
regarded
France
*NL*
with
ill-temper
,
and
which
France
regarded
with
irony
;
good
old
owls
*NL*
of
marquises
by
the
streetful
,
who
had
returned
,
and
of
ghosts
,
the
*NL*
``
former
''
subjects
of
amazement
at
everything
,
brave
and
noble
gentlemen
*NL*
who
smiled
at
being
in
France
but
wept
also
,
delighted
to
behold
*NL*
their
country
once
more
,
in
despair
at
not
finding
their
monarchy
;
the
*NL*
nobility
of
the
Crusades
treating
the
nobility
of
the
Empire
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
the
nobility
of
the
sword
,
with
scorn
;
historic
races
who
had
*NL*
lost
the
sense
of
history
;
the
sons
of
the
companions
of
Charlemagne
*NL*
disdaining
the
companions
of
Napoleon
.
The
swords
,
as
we
have
just
*NL*
remarked
,
returned
the
insult
;
the
sword
of
Fontenoy
was
laughable
and
*NL*
nothing
but
a
scrap
of
rusty
iron
;
the
sword
of
Marengo
was
odious
and
*NL*
was
only
a
sabre
.
Former
days
did
not
recognize
Yesterday
.
People
no
*NL*
longer
had
the
feeling
for
what
was
grand
.
There
was
some
one
who
called
*NL*
Bonaparte
Scapin
.
This
Society
no
longer
exists
.
Nothing
of
it
,
we
*NL*
repeat
,
exists
to-day
.
When
we
select
from
it
some
one
figure
at
random
,
*NL*
and
attempt
to
make
it
live
again
in
thought
,
it
seems
as
strange
to
us
*NL*
as
the
world
before
the
Deluge
.
It
is
because
it
,
too
,
as
a
matter
of
*NL*
fact
,
has
been
engulfed
in
a
deluge
.
It
has
disappeared
beneath
two
*NL*
Revolutions
.
What
billows
are
ideas
!
How
quickly
they
cover
all
that
it
*NL*
is
their
mission
to
destroy
and
to
bury
,
and
how
promptly
they
create
*NL*
frightful
gulfs
!
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
physiognomy
of
the
salons
of
those
distant
and
candid
times
*NL*
when
M.
Martainville
had
more
wit
than
Voltaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
salons
had
a
literature
and
politics
of
their
own
.
They
believed
*NL*
in
Fievee
.
M.
Agier
laid
down
the
law
in
them
.
They
commentated
M.
*NL*
Colnet
,
the
old
bookseller
and
publicist
of
the
Quay
Malaquais
.
Napoleon
*NL*
was
to
them
thoroughly
the
Corsican
Ogre
.
Later
on
the
introduction
into
*NL*
history
of
M.
le
Marquis
de
Bonaparte
,
Lieutenant-General
of
the
King
's
*NL*
armies
,
was
a
concession
to
the
spirit
of
the
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
salons
did
not
long
preserve
their
purity
.
Beginning
with
1818
,
*NL*
doctrinarians
began
to
spring
up
in
them
,
a
disturbing
shade
.
Their
way
*NL*
was
to
be
Royalists
and
to
excuse
themselves
for
being
so
.
Where
the
*NL*
ultras
were
very
proud
,
the
doctrinarians
were
rather
ashamed
.
They
had
*NL*
wit
;
they
had
silence
;
their
political
dogma
was
suitably
impregnated
*NL*
with
arrogance
;
they
should
have
succeeded
.
They
indulged
,
and
usefully
*NL*
too
,
in
excesses
in
the
matter
of
white
neckties
and
tightly
buttoned
*NL*
coats
.
The
mistake
or
the
misfortune
of
the
doctrinarian
party
was
to
*NL*
create
aged
youth
.
They
assumed
the
poses
of
wise
men
.
They
dreamed
of
*NL*
engrafting
a
temperate
power
on
the
absolute
and
excessive
principle
.
*NL*
They
opposed
,
and
sometimes
with
rare
intelligence
,
conservative
*NL*
liberalism
to
the
liberalism
which
demolishes
.
They
were
heard
to
say
:
*NL*
``
Thanks
for
Royalism
!
It
has
rendered
more
than
one
service
.
It
has
*NL*
brought
back
tradition
,
worship
,
religion
,
respect
.
It
is
faithful
,
*NL*
brave
,
chivalric
,
loving
,
devoted
.
It
has
mingled
,
though
with
regret
,
*NL*
the
secular
grandeurs
of
the
monarchy
with
the
new
grandeurs
of
the
*NL*
nation
.
Its
mistake
is
not
to
understand
the
Revolution
,
the
Empire
,
*NL*
glory
,
liberty
,
young
ideas
,
young
generations
,
the
age
.
But
this
*NL*
mistake
which
it
makes
with
regard
to
us
,
--
have
we
not
sometimes
been
*NL*
guilty
of
it
towards
them
?
The
Revolution
,
whose
heirs
we
are
,
ought
to
*NL*
be
intelligent
on
all
points
.
To
attack
Royalism
is
a
misconstruction
of
*NL*
liberalism
.
What
an
error
!
And
what
blindness
!
Revolutionary
France
is
*NL*
wanting
in
respect
towards
historic
France
,
that
is
to
say
,
towards
its
*NL*
mother
,
that
is
to
say
,
towards
itself
.
After
the
5th
of
September
,
the
*NL*
nobility
of
the
monarchy
is
treated
as
the
nobility
of
the
Empire
was
*NL*
treated
after
the
5th
of
July
.
They
were
unjust
to
the
eagle
,
we
are
*NL*
unjust
to
the
fleur-de-lys
.
It
seems
that
we
must
always
have
something
*NL*
to
proscribe
!
Does
it
serve
any
purpose
to
ungild
the
crown
of
Louis
*NL*
XIV.
,
to
scrape
the
coat
of
arms
of
Henry
IV
.
?
We
scoff
at
M.
de
*NL*
Vaublanc
for
erasing
the
N
's
from
the
bridge
of
Jena
!
What
was
it
that
*NL*
he
did
?
What
are
we
doing
?
Bouvines
belongs
to
us
as
well
as
Marengo
.
*NL*
The
fleurs-de-lys
are
ours
as
well
as
the
N
's
.
That
is
our
patrimony
.
To
*NL*
what
purpose
shall
we
diminish
it
?
We
must
not
deny
our
country
in
the
*NL*
past
any
more
than
in
the
present
.
Why
not
accept
the
whole
of
history
?
*NL*
Why
not
love
the
whole
of
France
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
thus
that
doctrinarians
criticised
and
protected
Royalism
,
which
*NL*
was
displeased
at
criticism
and
furious
at
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ultras
marked
the
first
epoch
of
Royalism
,
congregation
*NL*
characterized
the
second
.
Skill
follows
ardor
.
Let
us
confine
ourselves
*NL*
here
to
this
sketch
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
this
narrative
,
the
author
of
this
book
has
encountered
*NL*
in
his
path
this
curious
moment
of
contemporary
history
;
he
has
been
*NL*
forced
to
cast
a
passing
glance
upon
it
,
and
to
trace
once
more
some
of
*NL*
the
singular
features
of
this
society
which
is
unknown
to-day
.
But
he
*NL*
does
it
rapidly
and
without
any
bitter
or
derisive
idea
.
Souvenirs
both
*NL*
respectful
and
affectionate
,
for
they
touch
his
mother
,
attach
him
to
*NL*
this
past
.
Moreover
,
let
us
remark
,
this
same
petty
world
had
a
grandeur
*NL*
of
its
own
.
One
may
smile
at
it
,
but
one
can
neither
despise
nor
hate
*NL*
it
.
It
was
the
France
of
former
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
Pontmercy
pursued
some
studies
,
as
all
children
do
.
When
he
*NL*
emerged
from
the
hands
of
Aunt
Gillenormand
,
his
grandfather
confided
*NL*
him
to
a
worthy
professor
of
the
most
purely
classic
innocence
.
This
*NL*
young
soul
which
was
expanding
passed
from
a
prude
to
a
vulgar
pedant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
went
through
his
years
of
college
,
then
he
entered
the
law
*NL*
school
.
He
was
a
Royalist
,
fanatical
and
severe
.
He
did
not
love
his
*NL*
grandfather
much
,
as
the
latter
's
gayety
and
cynicism
repelled
him
,
and
*NL*
his
feelings
towards
his
father
were
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
on
the
whole
,
a
cold
and
ardent
,
noble
,
generous
,
proud
,
*NL*
religious
,
enthusiastic
lad
;
dignified
to
harshness
,
pure
to
shyness
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
END
OF
THE
BRIGAND
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
Marius
'
classical
studies
coincided
with
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
's
departure
from
society
.
The
old
man
bade
farewell
to
*NL*
the
Faubourg
Saint-Germain
and
to
Madame
de
T.
's
salon
,
and
established
*NL*
himself
in
the
Mardis
,
in
his
house
of
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
.
*NL*
There
he
had
for
servants
,
in
addition
to
the
porter
,
that
chambermaid
,
*NL*
Nicolette
,
who
had
succeeded
to
Magnon
,
and
that
short-breathed
and
*NL*
pursy
Basque
,
who
have
been
mentioned
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1827
,
Marius
had
just
attained
his
seventeenth
year
.
One
evening
,
on
*NL*
his
return
home
,
he
saw
his
grandfather
holding
a
letter
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marius
,
''
said
M.
Gillenormand
,
``
you
will
set
out
for
Vernon
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
see
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
seized
with
a
trembling
fit
.
He
had
thought
of
everything
*NL*
except
this
--
that
he
should
one
day
be
called
upon
to
see
his
father
.
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
unexpected
,
more
surprising
,
and
,
let
us
admit
*NL*
it
,
more
disagreeable
to
him
.
It
was
forcing
estrangement
into
*NL*
reconciliation
.
It
was
not
an
affliction
,
but
it
was
an
unpleasant
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
in
addition
to
his
motives
of
political
antipathy
,
was
convinced
*NL*
that
his
father
,
the
slasher
,
as
M.
Gillenormand
called
him
on
his
*NL*
amiable
days
,
did
not
love
him
;
this
was
evident
,
since
he
had
abandoned
*NL*
him
to
others
.
Feeling
that
he
was
not
beloved
,
he
did
not
love
.
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
more
simple
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
so
astounded
that
he
did
not
question
M.
Gillenormand
.
The
*NL*
grandfather
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
he
is
ill
.
He
demands
your
presence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
a
pause
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Set
out
to-morrow
morning
.
I
think
there
is
a
coach
which
leaves
the
*NL*
Cour
des
Fontaines
at
six
o'clock
,
and
which
arrives
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
Take
it
.
He
says
that
here
is
haste
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
crushed
the
letter
in
his
hand
and
thrust
it
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
Marius
might
have
set
out
that
very
evening
and
have
been
with
his
*NL*
father
on
the
following
morning
.
A
diligence
from
the
Rue
du
Bouloi
*NL*
took
the
trip
to
Rouen
by
night
at
that
date
,
and
passed
through
Vernon
.
*NL*
Neither
Marius
nor
M.
Gillenormand
thought
of
making
inquiries
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
at
twilight
,
Marius
reached
Vernon
.
People
were
just
*NL*
beginning
to
light
their
candles
.
He
asked
the
first
person
whom
he
*NL*
met
for
``
M.
Pontmercy
's
house
.
''
For
in
his
own
mind
,
he
agreed
with
the
*NL*
Restoration
,
and
like
it
,
did
not
recognize
his
father
's
claim
to
the
*NL*
title
of
either
colonel
or
baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
was
pointed
out
to
him
.
He
rang
;
a
woman
with
a
little
lamp
in
*NL*
her
hand
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Pontmercy
?
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
remained
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
his
house
?
''
demanded
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
nodded
affirmatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
speak
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
shook
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
am
his
son
!
''
persisted
Marius
.
``
He
is
expecting
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
no
longer
expects
you
,
''
said
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
perceived
that
she
was
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
to
the
door
of
a
room
on
the
ground-floor
;
he
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
that
room
,
which
was
lighted
by
a
tallow
candle
standing
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
there
were
three
men
,
one
standing
erect
,
another
*NL*
kneeling
,
and
one
lying
at
full
length
,
on
the
floor
in
his
shirt
.
The
*NL*
one
on
the
floor
was
the
colonel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
two
were
the
doctor
,
and
the
priest
,
who
was
engaged
in
*NL*
prayer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
had
been
attacked
by
brain
fever
three
days
previously
.
As
*NL*
he
had
a
foreboding
of
evil
at
the
very
beginning
of
his
illness
,
he
*NL*
had
written
to
M.
Gillenormand
to
demand
his
son
.
The
malady
had
grown
*NL*
worse
.
On
the
very
evening
of
Marius
'
arrival
at
Vernon
,
the
colonel
had
*NL*
had
an
attack
of
delirium
;
he
had
risen
from
his
bed
,
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
servant
's
efforts
to
prevent
him
,
crying
:
``
My
son
is
not
coming
!
I
shall
*NL*
go
to
meet
him
!
''
Then
he
ran
out
of
his
room
and
fell
prostrate
on
the
*NL*
floor
of
the
antechamber
.
He
had
just
expired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
had
been
summoned
,
and
the
cure
.
The
doctor
had
arrived
too
*NL*
late
.
The
son
had
also
arrived
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
,
a
large
tear
could
be
distinguished
on
*NL*
the
pale
and
prostrate
colonel
's
cheek
,
where
it
had
trickled
from
his
*NL*
dead
eye
.
The
eye
was
extinguished
,
but
the
tear
was
not
yet
dry
.
That
*NL*
tear
was
his
son
's
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gazed
upon
that
man
whom
he
beheld
for
the
first
time
,
on
that
*NL*
venerable
and
manly
face
,
on
those
open
eyes
which
saw
not
,
on
those
*NL*
white
locks
,
those
robust
limbs
,
on
which
,
here
and
there
,
brown
*NL*
lines
,
marking
sword-thrusts
,
and
a
sort
of
red
stars
,
which
indicated
*NL*
bullet-holes
,
were
visible
.
He
contemplated
that
gigantic
sear
which
*NL*
stamped
heroism
on
that
countenance
upon
which
God
had
imprinted
*NL*
goodness
.
He
reflected
that
this
man
was
his
father
,
and
that
this
man
*NL*
was
dead
,
and
a
chill
ran
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sorrow
which
he
felt
was
the
sorrow
which
he
would
have
felt
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
any
other
man
whom
he
had
chanced
to
behold
stretched
out
in
*NL*
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anguish
,
poignant
anguish
,
was
in
that
chamber
.
The
servant-woman
was
*NL*
lamenting
in
a
corner
,
the
cure
was
praying
,
and
his
sobs
were
audible
,
*NL*
the
doctor
was
wiping
his
eyes
;
the
corpse
itself
was
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
the
priest
,
and
the
woman
gazed
at
Marius
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
their
affliction
without
uttering
a
word
;
he
was
the
stranger
there
.
*NL*
Marius
,
who
was
far
too
little
affected
,
felt
ashamed
and
embarrassed
at
*NL*
his
own
attitude
;
he
held
his
hat
in
his
hand
;
and
he
dropped
it
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
in
order
to
produce
the
impression
that
grief
had
deprived
him
of
*NL*
the
strength
to
hold
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
he
experienced
remorse
,
and
he
despised
himself
for
*NL*
behaving
in
this
manner
.
But
was
it
his
fault
?
He
did
not
love
his
*NL*
father
?
Why
should
he
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
colonel
had
left
nothing
.
The
sale
of
big
furniture
barely
paid
the
*NL*
expenses
of
his
burial
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
servant
found
a
scrap
of
paper
,
which
she
handed
to
Marius
.
It
*NL*
contained
the
following
,
in
the
colonel
's
handwriting
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
son
.
--
The
Emperor
made
me
a
Baron
on
the
battle-field
of
*NL*
Waterloo
.
Since
the
Restoration
disputes
my
right
to
this
title
which
I
*NL*
purchased
with
my
blood
,
my
son
shall
take
it
and
bear
it
.
That
he
will
*NL*
be
worthy
of
it
is
a
matter
of
course
.
''
Below
,
the
colonel
had
added
:
*NL*
``
At
that
same
battle
of
Waterloo
,
a
sergeant
saved
my
life
.
The
man
's
*NL*
name
was
Thenardier
.
I
think
that
he
has
recently
been
keeping
a
*NL*
little
inn
,
in
a
village
in
the
neighborhood
of
Paris
,
at
Chelles
or
*NL*
Montfermeil
.
If
my
son
meets
him
,
he
will
do
all
the
good
he
can
to
*NL*
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
took
this
paper
and
preserved
it
,
not
out
of
duty
to
his
father
,
*NL*
but
because
of
that
vague
respect
for
death
which
is
always
imperious
in
*NL*
the
heart
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
remained
of
the
colonel
.
M.
Gillenormand
had
his
sword
and
*NL*
uniform
sold
to
an
old-clothes
dealer
.
The
neighbors
devastated
the
*NL*
garden
and
pillaged
the
rare
flowers
.
The
other
plants
turned
to
nettles
*NL*
and
weeds
,
and
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
remained
only
forty-eight
hours
at
Vernon
.
After
the
interment
he
*NL*
returned
to
Paris
,
and
applied
himself
again
to
his
law
studies
,
with
*NL*
no
more
thought
of
his
father
than
if
the
latter
had
never
lived
.
In
two
*NL*
days
the
colonel
was
buried
,
and
in
three
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
wore
crape
on
his
hat
.
That
was
all
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
UTILITY
OF
GOING
TO
MASS
,
IN
ORDER
TO
BECOME
A
*NL*
REVOLUTIONIST
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
preserved
the
religious
habits
of
his
childhood
.
One
Sunday
,
*NL*
when
he
went
to
hear
mass
at
Saint-Sulpice
,
at
that
same
chapel
of
the
*NL*
Virgin
whither
his
aunt
had
led
him
when
a
small
lad
,
he
placed
himself
*NL*
behind
a
pillar
,
being
more
absent-minded
and
thoughtful
than
usual
on
*NL*
that
occasion
,
and
knelt
down
,
without
paying
any
special
heed
,
upon
a
*NL*
chair
of
Utrecht
velvet
,
on
the
back
of
which
was
inscribed
this
name
:
*NL*
Monsieur
Mabeuf
,
warden
.
Mass
had
hardly
begun
when
an
old
man
presented
*NL*
himself
and
said
to
Marius
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
place
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
stepped
aside
promptly
,
and
the
old
man
took
possession
of
his
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mass
concluded
,
Marius
still
stood
thoughtfully
a
few
paces
distant
;
*NL*
the
old
man
approached
him
again
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
sir
,
for
having
disturbed
you
a
while
ago
,
and
for
*NL*
again
disturbing
you
at
this
moment
;
you
must
have
thought
me
intrusive
,
*NL*
and
I
will
explain
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
no
need
of
that
,
Sir
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
went
on
the
old
man
,
``
I
do
not
wish
you
to
have
a
bad
opinion
of
*NL*
me
.
You
see
,
I
am
attached
to
this
place
.
It
seems
to
me
that
the
mass
*NL*
is
better
from
here
.
Why
?
I
will
tell
you
.
It
is
from
this
place
,
that
*NL*
I
have
watched
a
poor
,
brave
father
come
regularly
,
every
two
or
three
*NL*
months
,
for
the
last
ten
years
,
since
he
had
no
other
opportunity
and
*NL*
no
other
way
of
seeing
his
child
,
because
he
was
prevented
by
family
*NL*
arrangements
.
He
came
at
the
hour
when
he
knew
that
his
son
would
be
*NL*
brought
to
mass
.
The
little
one
never
suspected
that
his
father
was
*NL*
there
.
Perhaps
he
did
not
even
know
that
he
had
a
father
,
poor
innocent
!
*NL*
The
father
kept
behind
a
pillar
,
so
that
he
might
not
be
seen
.
He
gazed
*NL*
at
his
child
and
he
wept
.
He
adored
that
little
fellow
,
poor
man
!
I
*NL*
could
see
that
.
This
spot
has
become
sanctified
in
my
sight
,
and
I
have
*NL*
contracted
a
habit
of
coming
hither
to
listen
to
the
mass
.
I
prefer
it
*NL*
to
the
stall
to
which
I
have
a
right
,
in
my
capacity
of
warden
.
I
knew
*NL*
that
unhappy
gentleman
a
little
,
too
.
He
had
a
father-in-law
,
a
wealthy
*NL*
aunt
,
relatives
,
I
do
n't
know
exactly
what
all
,
who
threatened
to
*NL*
disinherit
the
child
if
he
,
the
father
,
saw
him
.
He
sacrificed
himself
*NL*
in
order
that
his
son
might
be
rich
and
happy
some
day
.
He
was
separated
*NL*
from
him
because
of
political
opinions
.
Certainly
,
I
approve
of
*NL*
political
opinions
,
but
there
are
people
who
do
not
know
where
to
stop
.
*NL*
Mon
Dieu
!
a
man
is
not
a
monster
because
he
was
at
Waterloo
;
a
father
*NL*
is
not
separated
from
his
child
for
such
a
reason
as
that
.
He
was
one
of
*NL*
Bonaparte
's
colonels
.
He
is
dead
,
I
believe
.
He
lived
at
Vernon
,
where
I
*NL*
have
a
brother
who
is
a
cure
,
and
his
name
was
something
like
Pontmarie
*NL*
or
Montpercy
.
He
had
a
fine
sword-cut
,
on
my
honor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pontmercy
,
''
suggested
Marius
,
turning
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
Pontmercy
.
Did
you
know
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
he
was
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
warden
clasped
his
hands
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
are
the
child
!
Yes
,
that
's
true
,
he
must
be
a
man
by
this
*NL*
time
.
Well
!
poor
child
,
you
may
say
that
you
had
a
father
who
loved
you
*NL*
dearly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
offered
his
arm
to
the
old
man
and
conducted
him
to
his
lodgings
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
he
said
to
M.
Gillenormand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
arranged
a
hunting-party
with
some
friends
.
Will
you
permit
me
*NL*
to
be
absent
for
three
days
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
!
''
replied
his
grandfather
.
``
Go
and
amuse
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
said
to
his
daughter
in
a
low
tone
,
and
with
a
wink
,
``
Some
love
*NL*
affair
!
''

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
CONSEQUENCES
OF
HAVING
MET
A
WARDEN
*NL*
*NL*
Where
it
was
that
Marius
went
will
be
disclosed
a
little
further
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
absent
for
three
days
,
then
he
returned
to
Paris
,
went
*NL*
straight
to
the
library
of
the
law-school
and
asked
for
the
files
of
the
*NL*
Moniteur
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
read
the
Moniteur
,
he
read
all
the
histories
of
the
Republic
and
*NL*
the
Empire
,
the
Memorial
de
Sainte-Helene
,
all
the
memoirs
,
all
the
*NL*
newspapers
,
the
bulletins
,
the
proclamations
;
he
devoured
everything
.
*NL*
The
first
time
that
he
came
across
his
father
's
name
in
the
bulletins
of
*NL*
the
grand
army
,
he
had
a
fever
for
a
week
.
He
went
to
see
the
generals
*NL*
under
whom
Georges
Pontmercy
had
served
,
among
others
,
Comte
H.
*NL*
Church-warden
Mabeuf
,
whom
he
went
to
see
again
,
told
him
about
the
life
*NL*
at
Vernon
,
the
colonel
's
retreat
,
his
flowers
,
his
solitude
.
Marius
came
*NL*
to
a
full
knowledge
of
that
rare
,
sweet
,
and
sublime
man
,
that
species
*NL*
of
lion-lamb
who
had
been
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
occupied
as
he
was
with
this
study
which
absorbed
all
*NL*
his
moments
as
well
as
his
thoughts
,
he
hardly
saw
the
Gillenormands
at
*NL*
all
.
He
made
his
appearance
at
meals
;
then
they
searched
for
him
,
and
he
*NL*
was
not
to
be
found
.
Father
Gillenormand
smiled
.
``
Bah
!
bah
!
He
is
just
*NL*
of
the
age
for
the
girls
!
''
Sometimes
the
old
man
added
:
``
The
deuce
!
*NL*
I
thought
it
was
only
an
affair
of
gallantry
,
It
seems
that
it
is
an
*NL*
affair
of
passion
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
passion
,
in
fact
.
Marius
was
on
the
high
road
to
adoring
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
his
ideas
underwent
an
extraordinary
change
.
The
*NL*
phases
of
this
change
were
numerous
and
successive
.
As
this
is
the
*NL*
history
of
many
minds
of
our
day
,
we
think
it
will
prove
useful
to
*NL*
follow
these
phases
step
by
step
and
to
indicate
them
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
history
upon
which
he
had
just
cast
his
eyes
appalled
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
effect
was
to
dazzle
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
that
time
,
the
Republic
,
the
Empire
,
had
been
to
him
only
*NL*
monstrous
words
.
The
Republic
,
a
guillotine
in
the
twilight
;
the
Empire
,
*NL*
a
sword
in
the
night
.
He
had
just
taken
a
look
at
it
,
and
where
he
had
*NL*
expected
to
find
only
a
chaos
of
shadows
,
he
had
beheld
,
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
unprecedented
surprise
,
mingled
with
fear
and
joy
,
stars
sparkling
,
*NL*
Mirabeau
,
Vergniaud
,
Saint-Just
,
Robespierre
,
Camille
,
Desmoulins
,
*NL*
Danton
,
and
a
sun
arise
,
Napoleon
.
He
did
not
know
where
he
stood
.
He
*NL*
recoiled
,
blinded
by
the
brilliant
lights
.
Little
by
little
,
when
his
*NL*
astonishment
had
passed
off
,
he
grew
accustomed
to
this
radiance
,
he
*NL*
contemplated
these
deeds
without
dizziness
,
he
examined
these
personages
*NL*
without
terror
;
the
Revolution
and
the
Empire
presented
themselves
*NL*
luminously
,
in
perspective
,
before
his
mind
's
eye
;
he
beheld
each
of
*NL*
these
groups
of
events
and
of
men
summed
up
in
two
tremendous
facts
:
the
*NL*
Republic
in
the
sovereignty
of
civil
right
restored
to
the
masses
,
*NL*
the
Empire
in
the
sovereignty
of
the
French
idea
imposed
on
Europe
;
he
*NL*
beheld
the
grand
figure
of
the
people
emerge
from
the
Revolution
,
and
*NL*
the
grand
figure
of
France
spring
forth
from
the
Empire
.
He
asserted
*NL*
in
his
conscience
,
that
all
this
had
been
good
.
What
his
dazzled
state
*NL*
neglected
in
this
,
his
first
far
too
synthetic
estimation
,
we
do
not
*NL*
think
it
necessary
to
point
out
here
.
It
is
the
state
of
a
mind
on
the
*NL*
march
that
we
are
recording
.
Progress
is
not
accomplished
in
one
stage
.
*NL*
That
stated
,
once
for
all
,
in
connection
with
what
precedes
as
well
as
*NL*
with
what
is
to
follow
,
we
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
perceived
that
,
up
to
that
moment
,
he
had
comprehended
his
*NL*
country
no
more
than
he
had
comprehended
his
father
.
He
had
not
known
*NL*
either
the
one
or
the
other
,
and
a
sort
of
voluntary
night
had
obscured
*NL*
his
eyes
.
Now
he
saw
,
and
on
the
one
hand
he
admired
,
while
on
the
other
*NL*
he
adored
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
filled
with
regret
and
remorse
,
and
he
reflected
in
despair
that
*NL*
all
he
had
in
his
soul
could
now
be
said
only
to
the
tomb
.
Oh
!
if
his
*NL*
father
had
still
been
in
existence
,
if
he
had
still
had
him
,
if
God
,
in
*NL*
his
compassion
and
his
goodness
,
had
permitted
his
father
to
be
still
*NL*
among
the
living
,
how
he
would
have
run
,
how
he
would
have
precipitated
*NL*
himself
,
how
he
would
have
cried
to
his
father
:
``
Father
!
Here
I
am
!
It
*NL*
is
I
!
I
have
the
same
heart
as
thou
!
I
am
thy
son
!
''
How
he
would
have
*NL*
embraced
that
white
head
,
bathed
his
hair
in
tears
,
gazed
upon
his
scar
,
*NL*
pressed
his
hands
,
adored
his
garment
,
kissed
his
feet
!
Oh
!
Why
had
his
*NL*
father
died
so
early
,
before
his
time
,
before
the
justice
,
the
love
of
*NL*
his
son
had
come
to
him
?
Marius
had
a
continual
sob
in
his
heart
,
which
*NL*
said
to
him
every
moment
:
``
Alas
!
''
At
the
same
time
,
he
became
more
truly
*NL*
serious
,
more
truly
grave
,
more
sure
of
his
thought
and
his
faith
.
At
*NL*
each
instant
,
gleams
of
the
true
came
to
complete
his
reason
.
An
inward
*NL*
growth
seemed
to
be
in
progress
within
him
.
He
was
conscious
of
a
sort
*NL*
of
natural
enlargement
,
which
gave
him
two
things
that
were
new
to
*NL*
him
--
his
father
and
his
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
everything
opens
when
one
has
a
key
,
so
he
explained
to
himself
that
*NL*
which
he
had
hated
,
he
penetrated
that
which
he
had
abhorred
;
henceforth
*NL*
he
plainly
perceived
the
providential
,
divine
and
human
sense
of
the
*NL*
great
things
which
he
had
been
taught
to
detest
,
and
of
the
great
men
*NL*
whom
he
had
been
instructed
to
curse
.
When
he
reflected
on
his
former
*NL*
opinions
,
which
were
but
those
of
yesterday
,
and
which
,
nevertheless
,
*NL*
seemed
to
him
already
so
very
ancient
,
he
grew
indignant
,
yet
he
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
rehabilitation
of
his
father
,
he
naturally
passed
to
the
*NL*
rehabilitation
of
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
latter
,
we
will
confess
,
was
not
effected
without
labor
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
his
infancy
,
he
had
been
imbued
with
the
judgments
of
the
party
of
*NL*
1814
,
on
Bonaparte
.
Now
,
all
the
prejudices
of
the
Restoration
,
all
its
*NL*
interests
,
all
its
instincts
tended
to
disfigure
Napoleon
.
It
execrated
*NL*
him
even
more
than
it
did
Robespierre
.
It
had
very
cleverly
turned
to
*NL*
sufficiently
good
account
the
fatigue
of
the
nation
,
and
the
hatred
of
*NL*
mothers
.
Bonaparte
had
become
an
almost
fabulous
monster
,
and
in
order
*NL*
to
paint
him
to
the
imagination
of
the
people
,
which
,
as
we
lately
*NL*
pointed
out
,
resembles
the
imagination
of
children
,
the
party
of
1814
*NL*
made
him
appear
under
all
sorts
of
terrifying
masks
in
succession
,
from
*NL*
that
which
is
terrible
though
it
remains
grandiose
to
that
which
is
*NL*
terrible
and
becomes
grotesque
,
from
Tiberius
to
the
bugaboo
.
Thus
,
in
*NL*
speaking
of
Bonaparte
,
one
was
free
to
sob
or
to
puff
up
with
*NL*
laughter
,
provided
that
hatred
lay
at
the
bottom
.
Marius
had
never
*NL*
entertained
--
about
that
man
,
as
he
was
called
--
any
other
ideas
in
his
*NL*
mind
.
They
had
combined
with
the
tenacity
which
existed
in
his
nature
.
*NL*
There
was
in
him
a
headstrong
little
man
who
hated
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reading
history
,
on
studying
him
,
especially
in
the
documents
and
*NL*
materials
for
history
,
the
veil
which
concealed
Napoleon
from
the
eyes
*NL*
of
Marius
was
gradually
rent
.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
immense
,
*NL*
and
he
suspected
that
he
had
been
deceived
up
to
that
moment
,
on
*NL*
the
score
of
Bonaparte
as
about
all
the
rest
;
each
day
he
saw
more
*NL*
distinctly
;
and
he
set
about
mounting
,
slowly
,
step
by
step
,
almost
*NL*
regretfully
in
the
beginning
,
then
with
intoxication
and
as
though
*NL*
attracted
by
an
irresistible
fascination
,
first
the
sombre
steps
,
then
*NL*
the
vaguely
illuminated
steps
,
at
last
the
luminous
and
splendid
steps
*NL*
of
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
he
was
alone
in
his
little
chamber
near
the
roof
.
His
candle
*NL*
was
burning
;
he
was
reading
,
with
his
elbows
resting
on
his
table
close
*NL*
to
the
open
window
.
All
sorts
of
reveries
reached
him
from
space
,
and
*NL*
mingled
with
his
thoughts
.
What
a
spectacle
is
the
night
!
One
hears
dull
*NL*
sounds
,
without
knowing
whence
they
proceed
;
one
beholds
Jupiter
,
which
*NL*
is
twelve
hundred
times
larger
than
the
earth
,
glowing
like
a
firebrand
,
*NL*
the
azure
is
black
,
the
stars
shine
;
it
is
formidable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
perusing
the
bulletins
of
the
grand
army
,
those
heroic
strophes
*NL*
penned
on
the
field
of
battle
;
there
,
at
intervals
,
he
beheld
his
*NL*
father
's
name
,
always
the
name
of
the
Emperor
;
the
whole
of
that
great
*NL*
Empire
presented
itself
to
him
;
he
felt
a
flood
swelling
and
rising
*NL*
within
him
;
it
seemed
to
him
at
moments
that
his
father
passed
close
*NL*
to
him
like
a
breath
,
and
whispered
in
his
ear
;
he
gradually
got
into
*NL*
a
singular
state
;
he
thought
that
he
heard
drums
,
cannon
,
trumpets
,
*NL*
the
measured
tread
of
battalions
,
the
dull
and
distant
gallop
of
the
*NL*
cavalry
;
from
time
to
time
,
his
eyes
were
raised
heavenward
,
and
gazed
*NL*
upon
the
colossal
constellations
as
they
gleamed
in
the
measureless
*NL*
depths
of
space
,
then
they
fell
upon
his
book
once
more
,
and
there
they
*NL*
beheld
other
colossal
things
moving
confusedly
.
His
heart
contracted
*NL*
within
him
.
He
was
in
a
transport
,
trembling
,
panting
.
All
at
once
,
*NL*
without
himself
knowing
what
was
in
him
,
and
what
impulse
he
was
*NL*
obeying
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
,
stretched
both
arms
out
of
the
window
,
*NL*
gazed
intently
into
the
gloom
,
the
silence
,
the
infinite
darkness
,
the
*NL*
eternal
immensity
,
and
exclaimed
:
``
Long
live
the
Emperor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
forth
,
all
was
over
;
the
Ogre
of
Corsica
,
--
the
*NL*
usurper
,
--
the
tyrant
,
--
the
monster
who
was
the
lover
of
his
own
*NL*
sisters
,
--
the
actor
who
took
lessons
of
Talma
,
--
the
poisoner
of
*NL*
Jaffa
,
--
the
tiger
,
--
Buonaparte
,
--
all
this
vanished
,
and
gave
place
*NL*
in
his
mind
to
a
vague
and
brilliant
radiance
in
which
shone
,
at
an
*NL*
inaccessible
height
,
the
pale
marble
phantom
of
Caesar
.
The
Emperor
had
*NL*
been
for
his
father
only
the
well-beloved
captain
whom
one
admires
,
for
*NL*
whom
one
sacrifices
one
's
self
;
he
was
something
more
to
Marius
.
He
was
*NL*
the
predestined
constructor
of
the
French
group
,
succeeding
the
Roman
*NL*
group
in
the
domination
of
the
universe
.
He
was
a
prodigious
architect
,
*NL*
of
a
destruction
,
the
continuer
of
Charlemagne
,
of
Louis
XI.
,
of
Henry
*NL*
IV.
,
of
Richelieu
,
of
Louis
XIV.
,
and
of
the
Committee
of
Public
Safety
,
*NL*
having
his
spots
,
no
doubt
,
his
faults
,
his
crimes
even
,
being
a
man
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
;
but
august
in
his
faults
,
brilliant
in
his
spots
,
*NL*
powerful
in
his
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
the
predestined
man
,
who
had
forced
all
nations
to
say
:
``
The
*NL*
great
nation
!
''
He
was
better
than
that
,
he
was
the
very
incarnation
of
*NL*
France
,
conquering
Europe
by
the
sword
which
he
grasped
,
and
the
world
*NL*
by
the
light
which
he
shed
.
Marius
saw
in
Bonaparte
the
dazzling
spectre
*NL*
which
will
always
rise
upon
the
frontier
,
and
which
will
guard
the
*NL*
future
.
Despot
but
dictator
;
a
despot
resulting
from
a
republic
and
*NL*
summing
up
a
revolution
.
Napoleon
became
for
him
the
man-people
as
Jesus
*NL*
Christ
is
the
man-God
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
perceived
,
that
like
all
new
converts
to
a
religion
,
his
*NL*
conversion
intoxicated
him
,
he
hurled
himself
headlong
into
adhesion
*NL*
and
he
went
too
far
.
His
nature
was
so
constructed
;
once
on
the
downward
*NL*
slope
,
it
was
almost
impossible
for
him
to
put
on
the
drag
.
Fanaticism
*NL*
for
the
sword
took
possession
of
him
,
and
complicated
in
his
mind
his
*NL*
enthusiasm
for
the
idea
.
He
did
not
perceive
that
,
along
with
genius
,
*NL*
and
pell-mell
,
he
was
admitting
force
,
that
is
to
say
,
that
he
was
*NL*
installing
in
two
compartments
of
his
idolatry
,
on
the
one
hand
that
*NL*
which
is
divine
,
on
the
other
that
which
is
brutal
.
In
many
respects
,
he
*NL*
had
set
about
deceiving
himself
otherwise
.
He
admitted
everything
.
There
*NL*
is
a
way
of
encountering
error
while
on
one
's
way
to
the
truth
.
He
had
a
*NL*
violent
sort
of
good
faith
which
took
everything
in
the
lump
.
In
the
new
*NL*
path
which
he
had
entered
on
,
in
judging
the
mistakes
of
the
old
regime
,
*NL*
as
in
measuring
the
glory
of
Napoleon
,
he
neglected
the
attenuating
*NL*
circumstances
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
,
a
tremendous
step
had
been
taken
.
Where
he
had
formerly
*NL*
beheld
the
fall
of
the
monarchy
,
he
now
saw
the
advent
of
France
.
His
*NL*
orientation
had
changed
.
What
had
been
his
East
became
the
West
.
He
had
*NL*
turned
squarely
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
revolutions
were
accomplished
within
him
,
without
his
family
*NL*
obtaining
an
inkling
of
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
during
this
mysterious
labor
,
he
had
entirely
shed
his
old
Bourbon
*NL*
and
ultra
skin
,
when
he
had
cast
off
the
aristocrat
,
the
Jacobite
and
*NL*
the
Royalist
,
when
he
had
become
thoroughly
a
revolutionist
,
profoundly
*NL*
democratic
and
republican
,
he
went
to
an
engraver
on
the
Quai
des
*NL*
Orfevres
and
ordered
a
hundred
cards
bearing
this
name
:
Le
Baron
Marius
*NL*
Pontmercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
only
the
strictly
logical
consequence
of
the
change
which
had
*NL*
taken
place
in
him
,
a
change
in
which
everything
gravitated
round
his
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
as
he
did
not
know
any
one
and
could
not
sow
his
cards
with
any
*NL*
porter
,
he
put
them
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
another
natural
consequence
,
in
proportion
as
he
drew
nearer
to
his
*NL*
father
,
to
the
latter
's
memory
,
and
to
the
things
for
which
the
*NL*
colonel
had
fought
five
and
twenty
years
before
,
he
receded
from
his
*NL*
grandfather
.
We
have
long
ago
said
,
that
M.
Gillenormand
's
temper
did
*NL*
not
please
him
.
There
already
existed
between
them
all
the
dissonances
*NL*
of
the
grave
young
man
and
the
frivolous
old
man
.
The
gayety
of
Geronte
*NL*
shocks
and
exasperates
the
melancholy
of
Werther
.
So
long
as
the
same
*NL*
political
opinions
and
the
same
ideas
had
been
common
to
them
both
,
*NL*
Marius
had
met
M.
Gillenormand
there
as
on
a
bridge
.
When
the
bridge
*NL*
fell
,
an
abyss
was
formed
.
And
then
,
over
and
above
all
,
Marius
*NL*
experienced
unutterable
impulses
to
revolt
,
when
he
reflected
that
it
*NL*
was
M.
Gillenormand
who
had
,
from
stupid
motives
,
torn
him
ruthlessly
*NL*
from
the
colonel
,
thus
depriving
the
father
of
the
child
,
and
the
child
*NL*
of
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
pity
for
his
father
,
Marius
had
nearly
arrived
at
aversion
*NL*
for
his
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
of
this
sort
,
however
,
was
betrayed
on
the
exterior
,
as
we
have
*NL*
already
said
.
Only
he
grew
colder
and
colder
;
laconic
at
meals
,
and
rare
*NL*
in
the
house
.
When
his
aunt
scolded
him
for
it
,
he
was
very
gentle
and
*NL*
alleged
his
studies
,
his
lectures
,
the
examinations
,
etc.
,
as
a
pretext
.
*NL*
His
grandfather
never
departed
from
his
infallible
diagnosis
:
``
In
love
!
*NL*
I
know
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
Marius
absented
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
that
he
goes
off
like
this
?
''
said
his
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
these
trips
,
which
were
always
very
brief
,
he
went
to
*NL*
Montfermeil
,
in
order
to
obey
the
injunction
which
his
father
had
*NL*
left
him
,
and
he
sought
the
old
sergeant
to
Waterloo
,
the
inn-keeper
*NL*
Thenardier
.
Thenardier
had
failed
,
the
inn
was
closed
,
and
no
one
knew
*NL*
what
had
become
of
him
.
Marius
was
away
from
the
house
for
four
days
on
*NL*
this
quest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
getting
decidedly
wild
,
''
said
his
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
thought
they
had
noticed
that
he
wore
something
on
his
breast
,
*NL*
under
his
shirt
,
which
was
attached
to
his
neck
by
a
black
ribbon
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
SOME
PETTICOAT
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
mentioned
a
lancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
great-grand-nephew
of
M.
Gillenormand
,
on
the
paternal
side
,
*NL*
who
led
a
garrison
life
,
outside
the
family
and
far
from
the
domestic
*NL*
hearth
.
Lieutenant
Theodule
Gillenormand
fulfilled
all
the
conditions
*NL*
required
to
make
what
is
called
a
fine
officer
.
He
had
``
a
lady
's
waist
,
''
*NL*
a
victorious
manner
of
trailing
his
sword
and
of
twirling
his
mustache
*NL*
in
a
hook
.
He
visited
Paris
very
rarely
,
and
so
rarely
that
Marius
had
*NL*
never
seen
him
.
The
cousins
knew
each
other
only
by
name
.
We
think
*NL*
we
have
said
that
Theodule
was
the
favorite
of
Aunt
Gillenormand
,
who
*NL*
preferred
him
because
she
did
not
see
him
.
Not
seeing
people
permits
one
*NL*
to
attribute
to
them
all
possible
perfections
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
the
elder
returned
to
her
*NL*
apartment
as
much
disturbed
as
her
placidity
was
capable
of
allowing
.
*NL*
Marius
had
just
asked
his
grandfather
's
permission
to
take
a
little
*NL*
trip
,
adding
that
he
meant
to
set
out
that
very
evening
.
``
Go
!
''
had
been
*NL*
his
grandfather
's
reply
,
and
M.
Gillenormand
had
added
in
an
aside
,
as
*NL*
he
raised
his
eyebrows
to
the
top
of
his
forehead
:
``
Here
he
is
passing
*NL*
the
night
out
again
.
''
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
had
ascended
to
*NL*
her
chamber
greatly
puzzled
,
and
on
the
staircase
had
dropped
this
*NL*
exclamation
:
``
This
is
too
much
!
''
--
and
this
interrogation
:
``
But
where
is
*NL*
it
that
he
goes
?
''
She
espied
some
adventure
of
the
heart
,
more
or
less
*NL*
illicit
,
a
woman
in
the
shadow
,
a
rendezvous
,
a
mystery
,
and
she
would
*NL*
not
have
been
sorry
to
thrust
her
spectacles
into
the
affair
.
Tasting
a
*NL*
mystery
resembles
getting
the
first
flavor
of
a
scandal
;
sainted
souls
*NL*
do
not
detest
this
.
There
is
some
curiosity
about
scandal
in
the
secret
*NL*
compartments
of
bigotry
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
was
the
prey
of
a
vague
appetite
for
learning
a
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
get
rid
of
this
curiosity
which
agitated
her
a
little
beyond
*NL*
her
wont
,
she
took
refuge
in
her
talents
,
and
set
about
scalloping
,
*NL*
with
one
layer
of
cotton
after
another
,
one
of
those
embroideries
of
the
*NL*
Empire
and
the
Restoration
,
in
which
there
are
numerous
cart-wheels
.
*NL*
The
work
was
clumsy
,
the
worker
cross
.
She
had
been
seated
at
this
for
*NL*
several
hours
when
the
door
opened
.
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
raised
*NL*
her
nose
.
Lieutenant
Theodule
stood
before
her
,
making
the
regulation
*NL*
salute
.
She
uttered
a
cry
of
delight
.
One
may
be
old
,
one
may
be
a
*NL*
prude
,
one
may
be
pious
,
one
may
be
an
aunt
,
but
it
is
always
agreeable
*NL*
to
see
a
lancer
enter
one
's
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
here
,
Theodule
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
way
through
town
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Embrace
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
goes
!
''
said
Theodule
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
kissed
her
.
Aunt
Gillenormand
went
to
her
writing-desk
and
opened
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
remain
with
us
a
week
at
least
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
this
very
evening
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
possible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mathematically
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remain
,
my
little
Theodule
,
I
beseech
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
says
`
yes
,
'
but
my
orders
say
`
no
.
'
The
matter
is
simple
.
*NL*
They
are
changing
our
garrison
;
we
have
been
at
Melun
,
we
are
being
*NL*
transferred
to
Gaillon
.
It
is
necessary
to
pass
through
Paris
in
order
*NL*
to
get
from
the
old
post
to
the
new
one
.
I
said
:
'
I
am
going
to
see
my
*NL*
aunt
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
something
for
your
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
put
ten
louis
into
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
pleasure
,
you
mean
to
say
,
my
dear
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Theodule
kissed
her
again
,
and
she
experienced
the
joy
of
having
some
of
*NL*
the
skin
scratched
from
her
neck
by
the
braidings
on
his
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
making
the
journey
on
horseback
,
with
your
regiment
?
''
she
asked
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
aunt
.
I
wanted
to
see
you
.
I
have
special
permission
.
My
servant
is
*NL*
taking
my
horse
;
I
am
travelling
by
diligence
.
And
,
by
the
way
,
I
want
*NL*
to
ask
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
my
cousin
Marius
Pontmercy
travelling
so
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
?
''
said
his
aunt
,
suddenly
pricked
to
the
quick
*NL*
with
a
lively
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
my
arrival
,
I
went
to
the
diligence
to
engage
my
seat
in
the
coupe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
traveller
had
already
come
to
engage
a
seat
in
the
imperial
.
I
saw
*NL*
his
name
on
the
card
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marius
Pontmercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wicked
fellow
!
''
exclaimed
his
aunt
.
``
Ah
!
your
cousin
is
not
a
*NL*
steady
lad
like
yourself
.
To
think
that
he
is
to
pass
the
night
in
a

But
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bosh
!
''
said
Theodule
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
an
event
occurred
to
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
the
elder
,
--
an
idea
*NL*
struck
her
.
If
she
had
been
a
man
,
she
would
have
slapped
her
brow
.
She
*NL*
apostrophized
Theodule
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
aware
whether
your
cousin
knows
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
have
seen
him
;
but
he
has
never
deigned
to
notice
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
going

travel
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
does
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
To

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
is
where
Marius
is
going

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
,
like
myself

he
should
stop
on

I
get
down
at
Vernon

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Marius

what
an
ugly

*NL*
While
you

,
are
called
Theodule

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
rather
be
called
Alfred

said
the
officer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
like

there
is

all
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
Theodule
replied
with
the
composure
of
a
man
of
bronze
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
petticoat
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
inward
laugh
which
denotes
certainty
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
evident
,
''
exclaimed
his
aunt
,
who
thought
she
heard
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
speaking
,
and
who
felt
her
conviction
become
irresistible
*NL*
at
that
word
fillette
,
accentuated
in
almost
the
very
same
fashion
by
*NL*
the
granduncle
and
the
grandnephew
.
She
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
us
a
favor
.
Follow
Marius
a
little
.
He
does
not
know
you
,
it
will
be
*NL*
easy
.
Since
a
lass
there
is
,
try
to
get
a
sight
of
her
.
You
must
write
*NL*
us
the
tale
.
It
will
amuse
his
grandfather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Theodule
had
no
excessive
taste
for
this
sort
of
spying
;
but
he
was
much
*NL*
touched
by
the
ten
louis
,
and
he
thought
he
saw
a
chance
for
a
possible
*NL*
sequel
.
He
accepted
the
commission
and
said
:
``
As
you
please
,
aunt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
in
an
aside
,
to
himself
:
``
Here
I
am
a
duenna
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
embraced
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
the
man
to
play
such
pranks
,
Theodule
.
You
obey
discipline
,
*NL*
you
are
the
slave
of
orders
,
you
are
a
man
of
scruples
and
duty
,
and
you
*NL*
would
not
quit
your
family
to
go
and
see
a
creature
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lancer
made
the
pleased
grimace
of
Cartouche
when
praised
for
his
*NL*
probity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
on
the
evening
following
this
dialogue
,
mounted
the
diligence
*NL*
without
suspecting
that
he
was
watched
.
As
for
the
watcher
,
the
*NL*
first
thing
he
did
was
to
fall
asleep
.
His
slumber
was
complete
and
*NL*
conscientious
.
Argus
snored
all
night
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
daybreak
,
the
conductor
of
the
diligence
shouted
:
``
Vernon
!
relay
of
*NL*
Vernon
!
Travellers
for
Vernon
!
''
And
Lieutenant
Theodule
woke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
he
growled
,
still
half
asleep
,
``
this
is
where
I
get
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
his
memory
cleared
by
degrees
,
the
effect
of
waking
,
he
*NL*
recalled
his
aunt
,
the
ten
louis
,
and
the
account
which
he
had
*NL*
undertaken
to
render
of
the
deeds
and
proceedings
of
Marius
.
This
set
*NL*
him
to
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
is
no
longer
in
the
coach
,
''
he
thought
,
as
he
rebuttoned
the
*NL*
waistcoat
of
his
undress
uniform
.
``
He
may
have
stopped
at
Poissy
;
he
may
*NL*
have
stopped
at
Triel
;
if
he
did
not
get
out
at
Meulan
,
he
may
have
got
*NL*
out
at
Mantes
,
unless
he
got
out
at
Rolleboise
,
or
if
he
did
not
go
on
*NL*
as
far
as
Pacy
,
with
the
choice
of
turning
to
the
left
at
Evreus
,
or
to
*NL*
the
right
at
Laroche-Guyon
.
Run
after
him
,
aunty
.
What
the
devil
am
I
to
*NL*
write
to
that
good
old
soul
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
pair
of
black
trousers
descending
from
the
imperial
,
*NL*
made
its
appearance
at
the
window
of
the
coupe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
that
be
Marius
?
''
said
the
lieutenant
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
peasant
girl
,
all
entangled
with
the
horses
and
the
postilions
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
vehicle
,
was
offering
flowers
to
the
travellers
.
``
Give
*NL*
your
ladies
flowers
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
approached
her
and
purchased
the
finest
flowers
in
her
flat
*NL*
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
''
said
Theodule
,
leaping
down
from
the
coupe
,
``
this
piques
my
*NL*
curiosity
.
Who
the
deuce
is
he
going
to
carry
those
flowers
to
?
She
*NL*
must
be
a
splendidly
handsome
woman
for
so
fine
a
bouquet
.
I
want
to
see
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
no
longer
in
pursuance
of
orders
,
but
from
personal
curiosity
,
like
*NL*
dogs
who
hunt
on
their
own
account
,
he
set
out
to
follow
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
paid
no
attention
to
Theodule
.
Elegant
women
descended
from
the
*NL*
diligence
;
he
did
not
glance
at
them
.
He
seemed
to
see
nothing
around
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
pretty
deeply
in
love
!
''
thought
Theodule
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
directed
his
steps
towards
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
,
''
said
Theodule
to
himself
.
``
Rendezvous
seasoned
with
a
bit
of
*NL*
mass
are
the
best
sort
.
Nothing
is
so
exquisite
as
an
ogle
which
passes
*NL*
over
the
good
God
's
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
church
,
Marius
did
not
enter
it
,
but
skirted
the
*NL*
apse
.
He
disappeared
behind
one
of
the
angles
of
the
apse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rendezvous
is
appointed
outside
,
''
said
Theodule
.
``
Let
's
have
a
look
*NL*
at
the
lass
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
advanced
on
the
tips
of
his
boots
towards
the
corner
which
Marius
*NL*
had
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
there
,
he
halted
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
with
his
forehead
clasped
in
his
hands
,
was
kneeling
upon
the
*NL*
grass
on
a
grave
.
He
had
strewn
his
bouquet
there
.
At
the
extremity
of
*NL*
the
grave
,
on
a
little
swelling
which
marked
the
head
,
there
stood
*NL*
a
cross
of
black
wood
with
this
name
in
white
letters
:
COLONEL
BARON
*NL*
PONTMERCY
.
Marius
'
sobs
were
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
``
lass
''
was
a
grave
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
MARBLE
AGAINST
GRANITE
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
hither
that
Marius
had
come
on
the
first
occasion
of
his
*NL*
absenting
himself
from
Paris
.
It
was
hither
that
he
had
come
every
time
*NL*
that
M.
Gillenormand
had
said
:
``
He
is
sleeping
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lieutenant
Theodule
was
absolutely
put
out
of
countenance
by
this
*NL*
unexpected
encounter
with
a
sepulchre
;
he
experienced
a
singular
and
*NL*
disagreeable
sensation
which
he
was
incapable
of
analyzing
,
and
which
*NL*
was
composed
of
respect
for
the
tomb
,
mingled
with
respect
for
the
*NL*
colonel
.
He
retreated
,
leaving
Marius
alone
in
the
cemetery
,
and
*NL*
there
was
discipline
in
this
retreat
.
Death
appeared
to
him
with
large
*NL*
epaulets
,
and
he
almost
made
the
military
salute
to
him
.
Not
knowing
*NL*
what
to
write
to
his
aunt
,
he
decided
not
to
write
at
all
;
and
it
is
*NL*
probable
that
nothing
would
have
resulted
from
the
discovery
made
*NL*
by
Theodule
as
to
the
love
affairs
of
Marius
,
if
,
by
one
of
those
*NL*
mysterious
arrangements
which
are
so
frequent
in
chance
,
the
scene
at
*NL*
Vernon
had
not
had
an
almost
immediate
counter-shock
at
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
returned
from
Vernon
on
the
third
day
,
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
morning
,
descended
at
his
grandfather
's
door
,
and
,
wearied
by
the
two
*NL*
nights
spent
in
the
diligence
,
and
feeling
the
need
of
repairing
his
*NL*
loss
of
sleep
by
an
hour
at
the
swimming-school
,
he
mounted
rapidly
to
*NL*
his
chamber
,
took
merely
time
enough
to
throw
off
his
travelling-coat
,
*NL*
and
the
black
ribbon
which
he
wore
round
his
neck
,
and
went
off
to
the
*NL*
bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
,
who
had
risen
betimes
like
all
old
men
in
good
health
,
*NL*
had
heard
his
entrance
,
and
had
made
haste
to
climb
,
as
quickly
as
his
*NL*
old
legs
permitted
,
the
stairs
to
the
upper
story
where
Marius
lived
,
*NL*
in
order
to
embrace
him
,
and
to
question
him
while
so
doing
,
and
to
find
*NL*
out
where
he
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
youth
had
taken
less
time
to
descend
than
the
old
man
had
to
*NL*
ascend
,
and
when
Father
Gillenormand
entered
the
attic
,
Marius
was
no
*NL*
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bed
had
not
been
disturbed
,
and
on
the
bed
lay
,
outspread
,
but
not
*NL*
defiantly
the
great-coat
and
the
black
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
this
better
,
''
said
M.
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
moment
later
,
he
made
his
entrance
into
the
salon
,
where
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
was
already
seated
,
busily
embroidering
her
*NL*
cart-wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
was
a
triumphant
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
held
in
one
hand
the
great-coat
,
and
in
the
other
the
*NL*
neck-ribbon
,
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Victory
!
We
are
about
to
penetrate
the
mystery
!
We
are
going
to
*NL*
learn
the
most
minute
details
;
we
are
going
to
lay
our
finger
on
the
*NL*
debaucheries
of
our
sly
friend
!
Here
we
have
the
romance
itself
.
I
have
*NL*
the
portrait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
a
case
of
black
shagreen
,
resembling
a
medallion
portrait
,
was
*NL*
suspended
from
the
ribbon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
took
this
case
and
gazed
at
it
for
some
time
without
opening
*NL*
it
,
with
that
air
of
enjoyment
,
rapture
,
and
wrath
,
with
which
a
poor
*NL*
hungry
fellow
beholds
an
admirable
dinner
which
is
not
for
him
,
pass
*NL*
under
his
very
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
this
evidently
is
a
portrait
.
I
know
all
about
such
things
.
That
is
*NL*
worn
tenderly
on
the
heart
.
How
stupid
they
are
!
Some
abominable
fright
*NL*
that
will
make
us
shudder
,
probably
!
Young
men
have
such
bad
taste
*NL*
nowadays
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
see
,
father
,
''
said
the
old
spinster
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
opened
by
the
pressure
of
a
spring
.
They
found
in
it
nothing
*NL*
but
a
carefully
folded
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
same
to
the
same
,
''
said
M.
Gillenormand
,
bursting
with
*NL*
laughter
.
``
I
know
what
it
is
.
A
billet-doux
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
let
us
read
it
!
''
said
the
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
put
on
her
spectacles
.
They
unfolded
the
paper
and
read
as
*NL*
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
son
.
--
The
Emperor
made
me
a
Baron
on
the
battlefield
of
*NL*
Waterloo
.
Since
the
Restoration
disputes
my
right
to
this
title
which
I
*NL*
purchased
with
my
blood
,
my
son
shall
take
it
and
bear
it
.
That
he
will
*NL*
be
worthy
of
it
is
a
matter
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
feelings
of
father
and
daughter
can
not
be
described
.
They
felt
*NL*
chilled
as
by
the
breath
of
a
death
's
-
head
.
They
did
not
exchange
a
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
M.
Gillenormand
said
in
a
low
voice
and
as
though
speaking
to
*NL*
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
slasher
's
handwriting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
aunt
examined
the
paper
,
turned
it
about
in
all
directions
,
then
put
*NL*
it
back
in
its
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
a
little
oblong
packet
,
enveloped
in
blue
paper
,
fell
*NL*
from
one
of
the
pockets
of
the
great-coat
.
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
*NL*
picked
it
up
and
unfolded
the
blue
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
contained
Marius
'
hundred
cards
.
She
handed
one
of
them
to
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
,
who
read
:
Le
Baron
Marius
Pontmercy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
rang
the
bell
.
Nicolette
came
.
M.
Gillenormand
took
the
*NL*
ribbon
,
the
case
,
and
the
coat
,
flung
them
all
on
the
floor
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
room
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carry
those
duds
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
full
hour
passed
in
the
most
profound
silence
.
The
old
man
and
the
old
*NL*
spinster
had
seated
themselves
with
their
backs
to
each
other
,
and
were
*NL*
thinking
,
each
on
his
own
account
,
the
same
things
,
in
all
probability
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
this
hour
,
Aunt
Gillenormand
said
:
--
``
A
pretty
state
*NL*
of
things
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
,
Marius
made
his
appearance
.
He
entered
.
Even
before
*NL*
he
had
crossed
the
threshold
,
he
saw
his
grandfather
holding
one
of
*NL*
his
own
cards
in
his
hand
,
and
on
catching
sight
of
him
,
the
latter
*NL*
exclaimed
with
his
air
of
bourgeois
and
grinning
superiority
which
was
*NL*
something
crushing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
well
!
well
!
well
!
well
!
so
you
are
a
baron
now
.
I
present
you
my
*NL*
compliments
.
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
reddened
slightly
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
that
I
am
the
son
of
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
ceased
to
laugh
,
and
said
harshly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
,
''
retorted
Marius
,
with
downcast
eyes
and
a
severe
air
,
``
was
*NL*
a
humble
and
heroic
man
,
who
served
the
Republic
and
France
gloriously
,
*NL*
who
was
great
in
the
greatest
history
that
men
have
ever
made
,
who
*NL*
lived
in
the
bivouac
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
,
beneath
grape-shot
and
*NL*
bullets
,
in
snow
and
mud
by
day
,
beneath
rain
at
night
,
who
captured
two
*NL*
flags
,
who
received
twenty
wounds
,
who
died
forgotten
and
abandoned
,
and
*NL*
who
never
committed
but
one
mistake
,
which
was
to
love
too
fondly
two
*NL*
ingrates
,
his
country
and
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
more
than
M.
Gillenormand
could
bear
to
hear
.
At
the
word
*NL*
republic
,
he
rose
,
or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
he
sprang
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
Every
word
that
Marius
had
just
uttered
produced
on
the
visage
of
the
*NL*
old
Royalist
the
effect
of
the
puffs
of
air
from
a
forge
upon
a
blazing
*NL*
brand
.
From
a
dull
hue
he
had
turned
red
,
from
red
,
purple
,
and
from
*NL*
purple
,
flame-colored
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marius
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Abominable
child
!
I
do
not
know
what
your
father
*NL*
was
!
I
do
not
wish
to
know
!
I
know
nothing
about
that
,
and
I
do
not
know
*NL*
him
!
But
what
I
do
know
is
,
that
there
never
was
anything
but
scoundrels
*NL*
among
those
men
!
They
were
all
rascals
,
assassins
,
red-caps
,
thieves
!
I
*NL*
say
all
!
I
say
all
!
I
know
not
one
!
I
say
all
!
Do
you
hear
me
,
Marius
!
*NL*
See
here
,
you
are
no
more
a
baron
than
my
slipper
is
!
They
were
all
*NL*
bandits
in
the
service
of
Robespierre
!
All
who
served
B-u-o-naparte
were
*NL*
brigands
!
They
were
all
traitors
who
betrayed
,
betrayed
,
betrayed
their
*NL*
legitimate
king
!
All
cowards
who
fled
before
the
Prussians
and
the
*NL*
English
at
Waterloo
!
That
is
what
I
do
know
!
Whether
Monsieur
your
*NL*
father
comes
in
that
category
,
I
do
not
know
!
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
so
much
*NL*
the
worse
,
your
humble
servant
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
his
turn
,
it
was
Marius
who
was
the
firebrand
and
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
who
was
the
bellows
.
Marius
quivered
in
every
limb
,
he
did
not
know
what
*NL*
would
happen
next
,
his
brain
was
on
fire
.
He
was
the
priest
who
beholds
*NL*
all
his
sacred
wafers
cast
to
the
winds
,
the
fakir
who
beholds
a
*NL*
passer-by
spit
upon
his
idol
.
It
could
not
be
that
such
things
had
been
*NL*
uttered
in
his
presence
.
What
was
he
to
do
?
His
father
had
just
been
*NL*
trampled
under
foot
and
stamped
upon
in
his
presence
,
but
by
whom
?
By
*NL*
his
grandfather
.
How
was
he
to
avenge
the
one
without
outraging
the
*NL*
other
?
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
insult
his
grandfather
and
it
was
*NL*
equally
impossible
for
him
to
leave
his
father
unavenged
.
On
the
one
*NL*
hand
was
a
sacred
grave
,
on
the
other
hoary
locks
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
there
for
several
moments
,
staggering
as
though
intoxicated
,
*NL*
with
all
this
whirlwind
dashing
through
his
head
;
then
he
raised
*NL*
his
eyes
,
gazed
fixedly
at
his
grandfather
,
and
cried
in
a
voice
of
*NL*
thunder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
with
the
Bourbons
,
and
that
great
hog
of
a
Louis
XVIII
.
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
had
been
dead
for
four
years
;
but
it
was
all
the
same
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
who
had
been
crimson
,
turned
whiter
than
his
hair
.
He
*NL*
wheeled
round
towards
a
bust
of
M.
le
Duc
de
Berry
,
which
stood
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
,
and
made
a
profound
bow
,
with
a
sort
of
peculiar
majesty
.
*NL*
Then
he
paced
twice
,
slowly
and
in
silence
,
from
the
fireplace
to
the
*NL*
window
and
from
the
window
to
the
fireplace
,
traversing
the
whole
length
*NL*
of
the
room
,
and
making
the
polished
floor
creak
as
though
he
had
been
a
*NL*
stone
statue
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
second
turn
,
he
bent
over
his
daughter
,
who
was
watching
this
*NL*
encounter
with
the
stupefied
air
of
an
antiquated
lamb
,
and
said
to
her
*NL*
with
a
smile
that
was
almost
calm
:
``
A
baron
like
this
gentleman
,
and
a
*NL*
bourgeois
like
myself
can
not
remain
under
the
same
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
drawing
himself
up
,
all
at
once
,
pallid
,
trembling
,
terrible
,
with
*NL*
his
brow
rendered
more
lofty
by
the
terrible
radiance
of
wrath
,
he
*NL*
extended
his
arm
towards
Marius
and
shouted
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
M.
Gillenormand
said
to
his
daughter
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
send
sixty
pistoles
every
six
months
to
that
blood-drinker
,
*NL*
and
you
will
never
mention
his
name
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
an
immense
reserve
fund
of
wrath
to
get
rid
of
,
and
not
knowing
*NL*
what
to
do
with
it
,
he
continued
to
address
his
daughter
as
you
instead
*NL*
of
thou
for
the
next
three
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
on
his
side
,
had
gone
forth
in
indignation
.
There
was
one
*NL*
circumstance
which
,
it
must
be
admitted
,
aggravated
his
exasperation
.
*NL*
There
are
always
petty
fatalities
of
the
sort
which
complicate
domestic
*NL*
dramas
.
They
augment
the
grievances
in
such
cases
,
although
,
in
reality
,
*NL*
the
wrongs
are
not
increased
by
them
.
While
carrying
Marius
'
``
duds
''
*NL*
precipitately
to
his
chamber
,
at
his
grandfather
's
command
,
Nicolette
*NL*
had
,
inadvertently
,
let
fall
,
probably
,
on
the
attic
staircase
,
which
*NL*
was
dark
,
that
medallion
of
black
shagreen
which
contained
the
paper
*NL*
penned
by
the
colonel
.
Neither
paper
nor
case
could
afterwards
be
found
.
*NL*
Marius
was
convinced
that
``
Monsieur
Gillenormand
''
--
from
that
day
forth
*NL*
he
never
alluded
to
him
otherwise
--
had
flung
``
his
father
's
testament
''
in
*NL*
the
fire
.
He
knew
by
heart
the
few
lines
which
the
colonel
had
written
,
*NL*
and
,
consequently
,
nothing
was
lost
.
But
the
paper
,
the
writing
,
that
*NL*
sacred
relic
,
--
all
that
was
his
very
heart
.
What
had
been
done
with
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
taken
his
departure
without
saying
whither
he
was
going
,
and
*NL*
without
knowing
where
,
with
thirty
francs
,
his
watch
,
and
a
few
clothes
*NL*
in
a
hand-bag
.
He
had
entered
a
hackney-coach
,
had
engaged
it
by
the
*NL*
hour
,
and
had
directed
his
course
at
hap-hazard
towards
the
Latin
*NL*
quarter
.

CHAPTER
I
--
A
GROUP
WHICH
BARELY
MISSED
BECOMING
HISTORIC
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
which
was
,
to
all
appearances
indifferent
,
a
certain
*NL*
revolutionary
quiver
was
vaguely
current
.
Breaths
which
had
started
*NL*
forth
from
the
depths
of
'89
and
'93
were
in
the
air
.
Youth
was
on
*NL*
the
point
,
may
the
reader
pardon
us
the
word
,
of
moulting
.
People
were
*NL*
undergoing
a
transformation
,
almost
without
being
conscious
of
it
,
*NL*
through
the
movement
of
the
age
.
The
needle
which
moves
round
the
*NL*
compass
also
moves
in
souls
.
Each
person
was
taking
that
step
in
advance
*NL*
which
he
was
bound
to
take
.
The
Royalists
were
becoming
liberals
,
*NL*
liberals
were
turning
democrats
.
It
was
a
flood
tide
complicated
with
*NL*
a
thousand
ebb
movements
;
the
peculiarity
of
ebbs
is
to
create
*NL*
intermixtures
;
hence
the
combination
of
very
singular
ideas
;
people
*NL*
adored
both
Napoleon
and
liberty
.
We
are
making
history
here
.
These
*NL*
were
the
mirages
of
that
period
.
Opinions
traverse
phases
.
Voltairian
*NL*
royalism
,
a
quaint
variety
,
had
a
no
less
singular
sequel
,
Bonapartist
*NL*
liberalism
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
groups
of
minds
were
more
serious
.
In
that
direction
,
they
*NL*
sounded
principles
,
they
attached
themselves
to
the
right
.
They
*NL*
grew
enthusiastic
for
the
absolute
,
they
caught
glimpses
of
infinite
*NL*
realizations
;
the
absolute
,
by
its
very
rigidity
,
urges
spirits
towards
*NL*
the
sky
and
causes
them
to
float
in
illimitable
space
.
There
is
nothing
*NL*
like
dogma
for
bringing
forth
dreams
.
And
there
is
nothing
like
dreams
*NL*
for
engendering
the
future
.
Utopia
to-day
,
flesh
and
blood
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
advanced
opinions
had
a
double
foundation
.
A
beginning
of
mystery
*NL*
menaced
``
the
established
order
of
things
,
''
which
was
suspicious
and
*NL*
underhand
.
A
sign
which
was
revolutionary
to
the
highest
degree
.
The
*NL*
second
thoughts
of
power
meet
the
second
thoughts
of
the
populace
in
*NL*
the
mine
.
The
incubation
of
insurrections
gives
the
retort
to
the
*NL*
premeditation
of
coups
d'etat
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
did
not
,
as
yet
,
exist
in
France
any
of
those
vast
underlying
*NL*
organizations
,
like
the
German
tugendbund
and
Italian
Carbonarism
;
but
*NL*
here
and
there
there
were
dark
underminings
,
which
were
in
process
of
*NL*
throwing
off
shoots
.
The
Cougourde
was
being
outlined
at
Aix
;
there
*NL*
existed
at
Paris
,
among
other
affiliations
of
that
nature
,
the
society
*NL*
of
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
were
these
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
?
A
society
which
had
for
its
object
*NL*
apparently
the
education
of
children
,
in
reality
the
elevation
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
declared
themselves
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
,
--
the
Abaisse
,
--
the
*NL*
debased
,
--
that
is
to
say
,
the
people
.
They
wished
to
elevate
the
people
.
*NL*
It
was
a
pun
which
we
should
do
wrong
to
smile
at
.
Puns
are
sometimes
*NL*
serious
factors
in
politics
;
witness
the
Castratus
ad
castra
,
which
made
*NL*
a
general
of
the
army
of
Narses
;
witness
:
Barbari
et
Barberini
;
witness
:
*NL*
Tu
es
Petrus
et
super
hanc
petram
,
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
were
not
numerous
,
it
was
a
secret
society
in
*NL*
the
state
of
embryo
,
we
might
almost
say
a
coterie
,
if
coteries
ended
in
*NL*
heroes
.
They
assembled
in
Paris
in
two
localities
,
near
the
fish-market
,
*NL*
in
a
wine-shop
called
Corinthe
,
of
which
more
will
be
heard
later
on
,
*NL*
and
near
the
Pantheon
in
a
little
cafe
in
the
Rue
Saint-Michel
called
*NL*
the
Cafe
Musain
,
now
torn
down
;
the
first
of
these
meeting-places
was
*NL*
close
to
the
workingman
,
the
second
to
the
students
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assemblies
of
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
were
usually
held
in
a
back
*NL*
room
of
the
Cafe
Musain
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
hall
,
which
was
tolerably
remote
from
the
cafe
,
with
which
it
was
*NL*
connected
by
an
extremely
long
corridor
,
had
two
windows
and
an
exit
*NL*
with
a
private
stairway
on
the
little
Rue
des
Gres
.
There
they
smoked
*NL*
and
drank
,
and
gambled
and
laughed
.
There
they
conversed
in
very
loud
*NL*
tones
about
everything
,
and
in
whispers
of
other
things
.
An
old
map
*NL*
of
France
under
the
Republic
was
nailed
to
the
wall
,
--
a
sign
quite
*NL*
sufficient
to
excite
the
suspicion
of
a
police
agent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
were
students
,
who
were
*NL*
on
cordial
terms
with
the
working
classes
.
Here
are
the
names
of
the
*NL*
principal
ones
.
They
belong
,
in
a
certain
measure
,
to
history
:
Enjolras
,
*NL*
Combeferre
,
Jean
Prouvaire
,
Feuilly
,
Courfeyrac
,
Bahorel
,
Lesgle
or
*NL*
Laigle
,
Joly
,
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
young
men
formed
a
sort
of
family
,
through
the
bond
of
friendship
.
*NL*
All
,
with
the
exception
of
Laigle
,
were
from
the
South
.

*NL*
This
was
a
remarkable
group
.
It
vanished
in
the
invisible
depths
which
*NL*
lie
behind
us
.
At
the
point
of
this
drama
which
we
have
now
reached
,
*NL*
it
will
not
perhaps
be
superfluous
to
throw
a
ray
of
light
upon
these
*NL*
youthful
heads
,
before
the
reader
beholds
them
plunging
into
the
shadow
*NL*
of
a
tragic
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
whose
name
we
have
mentioned
first
of
all
,
--
the
reader
shall
*NL*
see
why
later
on
,
--
was
an
only
son
and
wealthy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
was
a
charming
young
man
,
who
was
capable
of
being
terrible
.
He
*NL*
was
angelically
handsome
.
He
was
a
savage
Antinous
.
One
would
have
said
,
*NL*
to
see
the
pensive
thoughtfulness
of
his
glance
,
that
he
had
already
,
*NL*
in
some
previous
state
of
existence
,
traversed
the
revolutionary
*NL*
apocalypse
.
He
possessed
the
tradition
of
it
as
though
he
had
been
a
*NL*
witness
.
He
was
acquainted
with
all
the
minute
details
of
the
great
*NL*
affair
.
A
pontifical
and
warlike
nature
,
a
singular
thing
in
a
youth
.
He
*NL*
was
an
officiating
priest
and
a
man
of
war
;
from
the
immediate
point
of
*NL*
view
,
a
soldier
of
the
democracy
;
above
the
contemporary
movement
,
the
*NL*
priest
of
the
ideal
.
His
eyes
were
deep
,
his
lids
a
little
red
,
his
*NL*
lower
lip
was
thick
and
easily
became
disdainful
,
his
brow
was
lofty
.
A
*NL*
great
deal
of
brow
in
a
face
is
like
a
great
deal
of
horizon
in
a
view
.
*NL*
Like
certain
young
men
at
the
beginning
of
this
century
and
the
end
of
*NL*
the
last
,
who
became
illustrious
at
an
early
age
,
he
was
endowed
with
*NL*
excessive
youth
,
and
was
as
rosy
as
a
young
girl
,
although
subject
to
*NL*
hours
of
pallor
.
Already
a
man
,
he
still
seemed
a
child
.
His
two
and
*NL*
twenty
years
appeared
to
be
but
seventeen
;
he
was
serious
,
it
did
not
*NL*
seem
as
though
he
were
aware
there
was
on
earth
a
thing
called
woman
.
*NL*
He
had
but
one
passion
--
the
right
;
but
one
thought
--
to
overthrow
*NL*
the
obstacle
.
On
Mount
Aventine
,
he
would
have
been
Gracchus
;
in
the
*NL*
Convention
,
he
would
have
been
Saint-Just
.
He
hardly
saw
the
roses
,
he
*NL*
ignored
spring
,
he
did
not
hear
the
carolling
of
the
birds
;
the
bare
*NL*
throat
of
Evadne
would
have
moved
him
no
more
than
it
would
have
moved
*NL*
Aristogeiton
;
he
,
like
Harmodius
,
thought
flowers
good
for
nothing
*NL*
except
to
conceal
the
sword
.
He
was
severe
in
his
enjoyments
.
He
*NL*
chastely
dropped
his
eyes
before
everything
which
was
not
the
Republic
.
*NL*
He
was
the
marble
lover
of
liberty
.
His
speech
was
harshly
inspired
,
*NL*
and
had
the
thrill
of
a
hymn
.
He
was
subject
to
unexpected
outbursts
of
*NL*
soul
.
Woe
to
the
love-affair
which
should
have
risked
itself
beside
him
!
*NL*
If
any
grisette
of
the
Place
Cambrai
or
the
Rue
Saint-Jean-de-Beauvais
,
*NL*
seeing
that
face
of
a
youth
escaped
from
college
,
that
page
's
mien
,
*NL*
those
long
,
golden
lashes
,
those
blue
eyes
,
that
hair
billowing
in
the
*NL*
wind
,
those
rosy
cheeks
,
those
fresh
lips
,
those
exquisite
teeth
,
had
*NL*
conceived
an
appetite
for
that
complete
aurora
,
and
had
tried
her
beauty
*NL*
on
Enjolras
,
an
astounding
and
terrible
glance
would
have
promptly
shown
*NL*
her
the
abyss
,
and
would
have
taught
her
not
to
confound
the
mighty
*NL*
cherub
of
Ezekiel
with
the
gallant
Cherubino
of
Beaumarchais
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
side
of
Enjolras
,
who
represented
the
logic
of
the
Revolution
,
*NL*
Combeferre
represented
its
philosophy
.
Between
the
logic
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
and
its
philosophy
there
exists
this
difference
--
that
its
*NL*
logic
may
end
in
war
,
whereas
its
philosophy
can
end
only
in
peace
.
*NL*
Combeferre
complemented
and
rectified
Enjolras
.
He
was
less
lofty
,
but
*NL*
broader
.
He
desired
to
pour
into
all
minds
the
extensive
principles
of
*NL*
general
ideas
:
he
said
:
``
Revolution
,
but
civilization
''
;
and
around
the
*NL*
mountain
peak
he
opened
out
a
vast
view
of
the
blue
sky
.
The
Revolution
*NL*
was
more
adapted
for
breathing
with
Combeferre
than
with
Enjolras
.
*NL*
Enjolras
expressed
its
divine
right
,
and
Combeferre
its
natural
right
.
*NL*
The
first
attached
himself
to
Robespierre
;
the
second
confined
himself
*NL*
to
Condorcet
.
Combeferre
lived
the
life
of
all
the
rest
of
the
world
*NL*
more
than
did
Enjolras
.
If
it
had
been
granted
to
these
two
young
men
to
*NL*
attain
to
history
,
the
one
would
have
been
the
just
,
the
other
the
wise
*NL*
man
.
Enjolras
was
the
more
virile
,
Combeferre
the
more
humane
.
Homo
and
*NL*
vir
,
that
was
the
exact
effect
of
their
different
shades
.
Combeferre
was
*NL*
as
gentle
as
Enjolras
was
severe
,
through
natural
whiteness
.
He
loved
*NL*
the
word
citizen
,
but
he
preferred
the
word
man
.
He
would
gladly
*NL*
have
said
:
Hombre
,
like
the
Spanish
.
He
read
everything
,
went
to
*NL*
the
theatres
,
attended
the
courses
of
public
lecturers
,
learned
the
*NL*
polarization
of
light
from
Arago
,
grew
enthusiastic
over
a
lesson
in
*NL*
which
Geoffrey
Sainte-Hilaire
explained
the
double
function
of
the
*NL*
external
carotid
artery
,
and
the
internal
,
the
one
which
makes
the
face
,
*NL*
and
the
one
which
makes
the
brain
;
he
kept
up
with
what
was
going
*NL*
on
,
followed
science
step
by
step
,
compared
Saint-Simon
with
Fourier
,
*NL*
deciphered
hieroglyphics
,
broke
the
pebble
which
he
found
and
reasoned
*NL*
on
geology
,
drew
from
memory
a
silkworm
moth
,
pointed
out
the
faulty
*NL*
French
in
the
Dictionary
of
the
Academy
,
studied
Puysegur
and
Deleuze
,
*NL*
affirmed
nothing
,
not
even
miracles
;
denied
nothing
,
not
even
ghosts
;
*NL*
turned
over
the
files
of
the
Moniteur
,
reflected
.
He
declared
that
the
*NL*
future
lies
in
the
hand
of
the
schoolmaster
,
and
busied
himself
with
*NL*
educational
questions
.
He
desired
that
society
should
labor
without
*NL*
relaxation
at
the
elevation
of
the
moral
and
intellectual
level
,
at
*NL*
coining
science
,
at
putting
ideas
into
circulation
,
at
increasing
the
*NL*
mind
in
youthful
persons
,
and
he
feared
lest
the
present
poverty
of
*NL*
method
,
the
paltriness
from
a
literary
point
of
view
confined
to
two
*NL*
or
three
centuries
called
classic
,
the
tyrannical
dogmatism
of
official
*NL*
pedants
,
scholastic
prejudices
and
routines
should
end
by
converting
our
*NL*
colleges
into
artificial
oyster
beds
.
He
was
learned
,
a
purist
,
exact
,
*NL*
a
graduate
of
the
Polytechnic
,
a
close
student
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
thoughtful
``
even
to
chimaeras
,
''
so
his
friends
said
.
He
believed
in
*NL*
all
dreams
,
railroads
,
the
suppression
of
suffering
in
chirurgical
*NL*
operations
,
the
fixing
of
images
in
the
dark
chamber
,
the
electric
*NL*
telegraph
,
the
steering
of
balloons
.
Moreover
,
he
was
not
much
alarmed
*NL*
by
the
citadels
erected
against
the
human
mind
in
every
direction
,
by
*NL*
superstition
,
despotism
,
and
prejudice
.
He
was
one
of
those
who
think
*NL*
that
science
will
eventually
turn
the
position
.
Enjolras
was
a
chief
,
*NL*
Combeferre
was
a
guide
.
One
would
have
liked
to
fight
under
the
one
and
*NL*
to
march
behind
the
other
.
It
is
not
that
Combeferre
was
not
capable
of
*NL*
fighting
,
he
did
not
refuse
a
hand-to-hand
combat
with
the
obstacle
,
and
*NL*
to
attack
it
by
main
force
and
explosively
;
but
it
suited
him
better
to
*NL*
bring
the
human
race
into
accord
with
its
destiny
gradually
,
by
means
of
*NL*
education
,
the
inculcation
of
axioms
,
the
promulgation
of
positive
laws
;
*NL*
and
,
between
two
lights
,
his
preference
was
rather
for
illumination
than
*NL*
for
conflagration
.
A
conflagration
can
create
an
aurora
,
no
doubt
,
but
*NL*
why
not
await
the
dawn
?
A
volcano
illuminates
,
but
daybreak
furnishes
a
*NL*
still
better
illumination
.
Possibly
,
Combeferre
preferred
the
whiteness
*NL*
of
the
beautiful
to
the
blaze
of
the
sublime
.
A
light
troubled
by
smoke
,
*NL*
progress
purchased
at
the
expense
of
violence
,
only
half
satisfied
this
*NL*
tender
and
serious
spirit
.
The
headlong
precipitation
of
a
people
into
*NL*
the
truth
,
a
'
93
,
terrified
him
;
nevertheless
,
stagnation
was
still
*NL*
more
repulsive
to
him
,
in
it
he
detected
putrefaction
and
death
;
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
he
preferred
scum
to
miasma
,
and
he
preferred
the
torrent
to
the
*NL*
cesspool
,
and
the
falls
of
Niagara
to
the
lake
of
Montfaucon
.
In
*NL*
short
,
he
desired
neither
halt
nor
haste
.
While
his
tumultuous
friends
,
*NL*
captivated
by
the
absolute
,
adored
and
invoked
splendid
revolutionary
*NL*
adventures
,
Combeferre
was
inclined
to
let
progress
,
good
progress
,
take
*NL*
its
own
course
;
he
may
have
been
cold
,
but
he
was
pure
;
methodical
,
but
*NL*
irreproachable
;
phlegmatic
,
but
imperturbable
.
Combeferre
would
have
*NL*
knelt
and
clasped
his
hands
to
enable
the
future
to
arrive
in
all
*NL*
its
candor
,
and
that
nothing
might
disturb
the
immense
and
virtuous
*NL*
evolution
of
the
races
.
The
good
must
be
innocent
,
he
repeated
*NL*
incessantly
.
And
in
fact
,
if
the
grandeur
of
the
Revolution
consists
*NL*
in
keeping
the
dazzling
ideal
fixedly
in
view
,
and
of
soaring
thither
*NL*
athwart
the
lightnings
,
with
fire
and
blood
in
its
talons
,
the
beauty
*NL*
of
progress
lies
in
being
spotless
;
and
there
exists
between
Washington
,
*NL*
who
represents
the
one
,
and
Danton
,
who
incarnates
the
other
,
that
*NL*
difference
which
separates
the
swan
from
the
angel
with
the
wings
of
an
*NL*
eagle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Prouvaire
was
a
still
softer
shade
than
Combeferre
.
His
name
*NL*
was
Jehan
,
owing
to
that
petty
momentary
freak
which
mingled
with
the
*NL*
powerful
and
profound
movement
whence
sprang
the
very
essential
study
*NL*
of
the
Middle
Ages
.
Jean
Prouvaire
was
in
love
;
he
cultivated
a
pot
*NL*
of
flowers
,
played
on
the
flute
,
made
verses
,
loved
the
people
,
pitied
*NL*
woman
,
wept
over
the
child
,
confounded
God
and
the
future
in
the
same
*NL*
confidence
,
and
blamed
the
Revolution
for
having
caused
the
fall
of
a
*NL*
royal
head
,
that
of
Andre
Chenier
.
His
voice
was
ordinarily
delicate
,
*NL*
but
suddenly
grew
manly
.
He
was
learned
even
to
erudition
,
and
almost
an
*NL*
Orientalist
.
Above
all
,
he
was
good
;
and
,
a
very
simple
thing
to
those
*NL*
who
know
how
nearly
goodness
borders
on
grandeur
,
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
poetry
,
he
preferred
the
immense
.
He
knew
Italian
,
Latin
,
Greek
,
and
*NL*
Hebrew
;
and
these
served
him
only
for
the
perusal
of
four
poets
:
Dante
,
*NL*
Juvenal
,
AEschylus
,
and
Isaiah
.
In
French
,
he
preferred
Corneille
to
*NL*
Racine
,
and
Agrippa
d'Aubigne
to
Corneille
.
He
loved
to
saunter
through
*NL*
fields
of
wild
oats
and
corn-flowers
,
and
busied
himself
with
clouds
*NL*
nearly
as
much
as
with
events
.
His
mind
had
two
attitudes
,
one
on
*NL*
the
side
towards
man
,
the
other
on
that
towards
God
;
he
studied
or
*NL*
he
contemplated
.
All
day
long
,
he
buried
himself
in
social
questions
,
*NL*
salary
,
capital
,
credit
,
marriage
,
religion
,
liberty
of
thought
,
*NL*
education
,
penal
servitude
,
poverty
,
association
,
property
,
production
*NL*
and
sharing
,
the
enigma
of
this
lower
world
which
covers
the
human
*NL*
ant-hill
with
darkness
;
and
at
night
,
he
gazed
upon
the
planets
,
those
*NL*
enormous
beings
.
Like
Enjolras
,
he
was
wealthy
and
an
only
son
.
He
spoke
*NL*
softly
,
bowed
his
head
,
lowered
his
eyes
,
smiled
with
embarrassment
,
*NL*
dressed
badly
,
had
an
awkward
air
,
blushed
at
a
mere
nothing
,
and
was
*NL*
very
timid
.
Yet
he
was
intrepid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feuilly
was
a
workingman
,
a
fan-maker
,
orphaned
both
of
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
who
earned
with
difficulty
three
francs
a
day
,
and
had
but
*NL*
one
thought
,
to
deliver
the
world
.
He
had
one
other
preoccupation
,
to
*NL*
educate
himself
;
he
called
this
also
,
delivering
himself
.
He
had
taught
*NL*
himself
to
read
and
write
;
everything
that
he
knew
,
he
had
learned
by
*NL*
himself
.
Feuilly
had
a
generous
heart
.
The
range
of
his
embrace
was
*NL*
immense
.
This
orphan
had
adopted
the
peoples
.
As
his
mother
had
*NL*
failed
him
,
he
meditated
on
his
country
.
He
brooded
with
the
profound
*NL*
divination
of
the
man
of
the
people
,
over
what
we
now
call
the
idea
of
*NL*
the
nationality
,
had
learned
history
with
the
express
object
of
raging
*NL*
with
full
knowledge
of
the
case
.
In
this
club
of
young
Utopians
,
*NL*
occupied
chiefly
with
France
,
he
represented
the
outside
world
.
He
had
*NL*
for
his
specialty
Greece
,
Poland
,
Hungary
,
Roumania
,
Italy
.
He
uttered
*NL*
these
names
incessantly
,
appropriately
and
inappropriately
,
with
the
*NL*
tenacity
of
right
.
The
violations
of
Turkey
on
Greece
and
Thessaly
,
of
*NL*
Russia
on
Warsaw
,
of
Austria
on
Venice
,
enraged
him
.
Above
all
things
,
*NL*
the
great
violence
of
1772
aroused
him
.
There
is
no
more
sovereign
*NL*
eloquence
than
the
true
in
indignation
;
he
was
eloquent
with
that
*NL*
eloquence
.
He
was
inexhaustible
on
that
infamous
date
of
1772
,
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
that
noble
and
valiant
race
suppressed
by
treason
,
and
that
*NL*
three-sided
crime
,
on
that
monstrous
ambush
,
the
prototype
and
pattern
*NL*
of
all
those
horrible
suppressions
of
states
,
which
,
since
that
time
,
*NL*
have
struck
many
a
noble
nation
,
and
have
annulled
their
certificate
of
*NL*
birth
,
so
to
speak
.
All
contemporary
social
crimes
have
their
origin
in
*NL*
the
partition
of
Poland
.
The
partition
of
Poland
is
a
theorem
of
which
*NL*
all
present
political
outrages
are
the
corollaries
.
There
has
not
been
*NL*
a
despot
,
nor
a
traitor
for
nearly
a
century
back
,
who
has
not
signed
,
*NL*
approved
,
counter-signed
,
and

the

Poland
.
When
the
record
of
modern
treasons
was
examined
,
that
was
the
*NL*
first
thing
which
made
its
appearance
.
The
congress
of
Vienna
consulted
*NL*
that
crime
before
consummating
its
own
.
1772
sounded
the
onset
;
1815
*NL*
was
the
death
of
the
game
.
Such
was
Feuilly
's
habitual
text
.
This
*NL*
poor
workingman
had
constituted
himself
the
tutor
of
Justice
,
and
she
*NL*
recompensed
him
by
rendering
him
great
.
The
fact
is
,
that
there
is
*NL*
eternity
in
right
.
Warsaw
can
no
more
be
Tartar
than
Venice
can
be
*NL*
Teuton
.
Kings
lose
their
pains
and
their
honor
in
the
attempt
to
make
*NL*
them
so
.
Sooner
or
later
,
the
submerged
part
floats
to
the
surface
and
*NL*
reappears
.
Greece
becomes
Greece
again
,
Italy
is
once
more
Italy
.
The
*NL*
protest
of
right
against
the
deed
persists
forever
.
The
theft
of
a
*NL*
nation
can
not
be
allowed
by
prescription
.
These
lofty
deeds
of
rascality
*NL*
have
no
future
.
A
nation
can
not
have
its
mark
extracted
like
a
pocket
*NL*
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
had
a
father
who
was
called
M.
de
Courfeyrac
.
One
of
*NL*
the
false
ideas
of
the
bourgeoisie
under
the
Restoration
as
regards
*NL*
aristocracy
and
the
nobility
was
to
believe
in
the
particle
.
The
*NL*
particle
,
as
every
one
knows
,
possesses
no
significance
.
But
the
*NL*
bourgeois
of
the
epoch
of
la
Minerve
estimated
so
highly
that
poor
de
,
*NL*
that
they
thought
themselves
bound
to
abdicate
it
.
M.
de
Chauvelin
*NL*
had
himself
called
M.
Chauvelin
;
M.
de
Caumartin
,
M.
Caumartin

Constant

,

*NL*
Courfeyrac
had
not
wished
to
remain
behind
the
rest
,
and
called
himself
*NL*
plain
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
might
almost
,
so
far
as
Courfeyrac
is
concerned
,
stop
here
,
*NL*
and
confine
ourselves
to
saying
with
regard
to
what
remains
:
``
For
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
see
Tholomyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
had
,
in
fact
,
that
animation
of
youth
which
may
be
called
*NL*
the
beaute
du
diable
of
the
mind
.
Later
on
,
this
disappears
like
the
*NL*
playfulness
of
the
kitten
,
and
all
this
grace
ends
,
with
the
bourgeois
,
*NL*
on
two
legs
,
and
with
the
tomcat
,
on
four
paws
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sort
of
wit
is
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
of
the
*NL*
successive
levies
of
youth
who
traverse
the
schools
,
who
pass
it
from
*NL*
hand
to
hand
,
quasi
cursores
,
and
is
almost
always
exactly
the
same
;
*NL*
so
that
,
as
we
have
just
pointed
out
,
any
one
who
had
listened
to
*NL*
Courfeyrac
in
1828
would
have
thought
he
heard
Tholomyes
in
1817
.
Only
,
*NL*
Courfeyrac
was
an
honorable
fellow
.
Beneath
the
apparent
similarities
*NL*
of
the
exterior
mind
,
the
difference
between
him
and
Tholomyes
was
very
*NL*
great
.
The
latent
man
which
existed
in
the
two
was
totally
different
*NL*
in
the
first
from
what
it
was
in
the
second
.
There
was
in
Tholomyes
a
*NL*
district
attorney
,
and
in
Courfeyrac
a
paladin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
was
the
chief
,
Combeferre
was
the
guide
,
Courfeyrac
was
the
*NL*
centre
.
The
others
gave
more
light
,
he
shed
more
warmth
;
the
truth
is
,
*NL*
that
he
possessed
all
the
qualities
of
a
centre
,
roundness
and
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
had
figured
in
the
bloody
tumult
of
June
,
1822
,
on
the
occasion
*NL*
of
the
burial
of
young
Lallemand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
was
a
good-natured
mortal
,
who
kept
bad
company
,
brave
,
a
*NL*
spendthrift
,
prodigal
,
and
to
the
verge
of
generosity
,
talkative
,
and
*NL*
at
times
eloquent
,
bold
to
the
verge
of
effrontery
;
the
best
fellow
*NL*
possible
;
he
had
daring
waistcoats
,
and
scarlet
opinions
;
a
wholesale
*NL*
blusterer
,
that
is
to
say
,
loving
nothing
so
much
as
a
quarrel
,
unless
*NL*
it
were
an
uprising
;
and
nothing
so
much
as
an
uprising
,
unless
it
were
*NL*
a
revolution
;
always
ready
to
smash
a
window-pane
,
then
to
tear
up
the
*NL*
pavement
,
then
to
demolish
a
government
,
just
to
see
the
effect
of
it
;
*NL*
a
student
in
his
eleventh
year
.
He
had
nosed
about
the
law
,
but
did
not
*NL*
practise
it
.
He
had
taken
for
his
device
:
``
Never
a
lawyer
,
''
and
for
his
*NL*
armorial
bearings
a
nightstand
in
which
was
visible
a
square
cap
.
Every
*NL*
time
that
he
passed
the
law-school
,
which
rarely
happened
,
he
buttoned
*NL*
up
his
frock-coat
,
--
the
paletot
had
not
yet
been
invented
,
--
and
took
*NL*
hygienic
precautions
.
Of
the
school
porter
he
said
:
``
What
a
fine
*NL*
old
man
!
''
and
of
the
dean
,
M.
Delvincourt
:
``
What
a
monument
!
''
In
his
*NL*
lectures
he
espied
subjects
for
ballads
,
and
in
his
professors
occasions
*NL*
for
caricature
.
He
wasted
a
tolerably
large
allowance
,
something
like
*NL*
three
thousand
francs
a
year
,
in
doing
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
peasant
parents
whom
he
had
contrived
to
imbue
with
respect
for
*NL*
their
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
of
them
:
``
They
are
peasants
and
not
bourgeois
;
that
is
the
*NL*
reason
they
are
intelligent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
,
a
man
of
caprice
,
was
scattered
over
numerous
cafes
;
the
others
*NL*
had
habits
,
he
had
none
.
He
sauntered
.
To
stray
is
human
.
To
saunter
*NL*
is
Parisian
.
In
reality
,
he
had
a
penetrating
mind
and
was
more
of
a
*NL*
thinker
than
appeared
to
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
served
as
a
connecting
link
between
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
and
*NL*
other
still
unorganized
groups
,
which
were
destined
to
take
form
later
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
conclave
of
young
heads
,
there
was
one
bald
member
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Marquis
d'Avaray
,
whom
Louis
XVIII
.
made
a
duke
for
having
assisted
*NL*
him
to
enter
a
hackney-coach
on
the
day
when
he
emigrated
,
was
wont
*NL*
to
relate
,
that
in
1814
,
on
his
return
to
France
,
as
the
King
was
*NL*
disembarking
at
Calais
,
a
man
handed
him
a
petition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
request
?
''
said
the
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sire
,
a
post-office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
L'Aigle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
King
frowned
,
glanced
at
the
signature
of
the
petition
and
beheld
*NL*
the
name
written
thus
:
LESGLE
.
This
non-Bonoparte
orthography
touched
*NL*
the
King
and
he
began
to
smile
.
``
Sire
,
''
resumed
the
man
with
the
*NL*
petition
,
``
I
had
for
ancestor
a
keeper
of
the
hounds
surnamed
*NL*
Lesgueules
.
This
surname
furnished
my
name
.
I
am
called
Lesgueules
,
by
*NL*
contraction
Lesgle
,
and
by
corruption
l'Aigle
.
''
This
caused
the
King
*NL*
to
smile
broadly
.
Later
on
he
gave
the
man
the
posting
office
of
Meaux
,
*NL*
either
intentionally
or
accidentally
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bald
member
of
the
group
was
the
son
of
this
Lesgle
,
or
Legle
,
and
*NL*
he
signed
himself
,
Legle
-LSB-
de
Meaux
-RSB-
.
As
an
abbreviation
,
his
companions
*NL*
called
him
Bossuet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
was
a
gay
but
unlucky
fellow
.
His
specialty
was
not
to
succeed
*NL*
in
anything
.
As
an
offset
,
he
laughed
at
everything
.
At
five
and
twenty
*NL*
he
was
bald
.
His
father
had
ended
by
owning
a
house
and
a
field
;
but
*NL*
he
,
the
son
,
had
made
haste
to
lose
that
house
and
field
in
a
bad
*NL*
speculation
.
He
had
nothing
left
.
He
possessed
knowledge
and
wit
,
but
*NL*
all
he
did
miscarried
.
Everything
failed
him
and
everybody
deceived
him
;
*NL*
what
he
was
building
tumbled
down
on
top
of
him
.
If
he
were
splitting
*NL*
wood
,
he
cut
off
a
finger
.
If
he
had
a
mistress
,
he
speedily
discovered
*NL*
that
he
had
a
friend
also
.
Some
misfortune
happened
to
him
every
moment
,
*NL*
hence
his
joviality
.
He
said
:
``
I
live
under
falling
tiles
.
''
He
was
*NL*
not
easily
astonished
,
because
,
for
him
,
an
accident
was
what
he
had
*NL*
foreseen
,
he
took
his
bad
luck
serenely
,
and
smiled
at
the
teasing
of
*NL*
fate
,
like
a
person
who
is
listening
to
pleasantries
.
He
was
poor
,
but
*NL*
his
fund
of
good
humor
was
inexhaustible
.
He
soon
reached
his
last
sou
,
*NL*
never
his
last
burst
of
laughter
.
When
adversity
entered
his
doors
,
he
*NL*
saluted
this
old
acquaintance
cordially
,
he
tapped
all
catastrophes
on
*NL*
the
stomach
;
he
was
familiar
with
fatality
to
the
point
of
calling
it
by
*NL*
its
nickname
:
``
Good
day
,
Guignon
,
''
he
said
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
persecutions
of
fate
had
rendered
him
inventive
.
He
was
full
of
*NL*
resources
.
He
had
no
money
,
but
he
found
means
,
when
it
seemed
good
to
*NL*
him
,
to
indulge
in
``
unbridled
extravagance
.
''
One
night
,
he
went
so
far
*NL*
as
to
eat
a
``
hundred
francs
''
in
a
supper
with
a
wench
,
which
inspired
*NL*
him
to
make
this
memorable
remark
in
the
midst
of
the
orgy
:
``
Pull
off
my
*NL*
boots
,
you
five-louis
jade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
was
slowly
directing
his
steps
towards
the
profession
of
a
*NL*
lawyer
;
he
was
pursuing
his
law
studies
after
the
manner
of
Bahorel
.
*NL*
Bossuet
had
not
much
domicile
,
sometimes
none
at
all
.
He
lodged
now
with
*NL*
one
,
now
with
another
,
most
often
with
Joly
.
Joly
was
studying
medicine
.
*NL*
He
was
two
years
younger
than
Bossuet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joly
was
the
``
malade
imaginaire
''
junior
.
What
he
had
won
in
medicine
was
*NL*
to
be
more
of
an
invalid
than
a
doctor
.
At
three
and
twenty
he
thought
*NL*
himself
a
valetudinarian
,
and
passed
his
life
in
inspecting
his
tongue
*NL*
in
the
mirror
.
He
affirmed
that
man
becomes
magnetic
like
a
needle
,
and
*NL*
in
his
chamber
he
placed
his
bed
with
its
head
to
the
south
,
and
the
*NL*
foot
to
the
north
,
so
that
,
at
night
,
the
circulation
of
his
blood
*NL*
might
not
be
interfered
with
by
the
great
electric
current
of
the
globe
.
*NL*
During
thunder
storms
,
he
felt
his
pulse
.
Otherwise
,
he
was
the
gayest
*NL*
of
them
all
.
All
these
young
,
maniacal
,
puny
,
merry
incoherences
lived
*NL*
in
harmony
together
,
and
the
result
was
an
eccentric
and
agreeable
*NL*
being
whom
his
comrades
,
who
were
prodigal
of
winged
consonants
,
called
*NL*
Jolllly
.
``
You
may
fly
away
on
the
four
L
's
,
''
Jean
Prouvaire
said
to
*NL*
him
.

*NL*
Joly
had
a
trick
of
touching
his
nose
with
the
tip
of
his
cane
,
which
is
*NL*
an
indication
of
a
sagacious
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
young
men
who
differed
so
greatly
,
and
who
,
on
the
whole
,
can
*NL*
only
be
discussed
seriously
,
held
the
same
religion
:
Progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
the
direct
sons
of
the
French
Revolution
.
The
most
giddy
of
*NL*
them
became
solemn
when
they
pronounced
that
date
:
'
89
.
Their
fathers
in
*NL*
the
flesh
had
been
,
either
royalists
,
doctrinaires
,
it
matters
not
what
;
*NL*
this
confusion
anterior
to
themselves
,
who
were
young
,
did
not
concern
*NL*
them
at
all
;
the
pure
blood
of
principle
ran
in
their
veins
.
They
*NL*
attached
themselves
,
without
intermediate
shades
,
to
incorruptible
right
*NL*
and
absolute
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Affiliated
and
initiated
,
they
sketched
out
the
ideal
underground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
all
these
glowing
hearts
and
thoroughly
convinced
minds
,
there
was
*NL*
one
sceptic
.
How
came
he
there
?
By
juxtaposition
.
This
sceptic
's
name
*NL*
was
Grantaire
,
and
he
was
in
the
habit
of
signing
himself
with
this
*NL*
rebus
:
R.
Grantaire
was
a
man
who
took
good
care
not
to
believe
in
*NL*
anything
.
Moreover
,
he
was
one
of
the
students
who
had
learned
the
most
*NL*
during
their
course
at
Paris
;
he
knew
that
the
best
coffee
was
to
be
had
*NL*
at
the
Cafe
Lemblin
,
and
the
best
billiards
at
the
Cafe
Voltaire
,
that
*NL*
good
cakes
and
lasses
were
to
be
found
at
the
Ermitage
,
on
the
Boulevard
*NL*
du
Maine
,
spatchcocked
chickens
at
Mother
Sauget
's
,
excellent
matelotes
*NL*
at
the
Barriere
de
la
Cunette
,
and
a
certain
thin
white
wine
at
the
*NL*
Barriere
du
Com
pat
.
He
knew
the
best
place
for
everything
;
in
*NL*
addition
,
boxing
and
foot-fencing
and
some
dances
;
and
he
was
a
thorough
*NL*
single-stick
player
.
He
was
a
tremendous
drinker
to
boot
.
He
was
*NL*
inordinately
homely
:
the
prettiest
boot-stitcher
of
that
day
,
Irma
*NL*
Boissy
,
enraged
with
his
homeliness
,
pronounced
sentence
on
him
as
*NL*
follows
:
``
Grantaire
is
impossible
''
;
but
Grantaire
's
fatuity
was
not
to
*NL*
be
disconcerted
.
He
stared
tenderly
and
fixedly
at
all
women
,
with
the
*NL*
air
of
saying
to
them
all
:
``
If
I
only
chose
!
''
and
of
trying
to
make
his
*NL*
comrades
believe
that
he
was
in
general
demand
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
those
words
:
rights
of
the
people
,
rights
of
man
,
the
social
*NL*
contract
,
the
French
Revolution
,
the
Republic
,
democracy
,
humanity
,
*NL*
civilization
,
religion
,
progress
,
came
very
near
to
signifying
nothing
*NL*
whatever
to
Grantaire
.
He
smiled
at
them
.
Scepticism
,
that
caries
of
the
*NL*
intelligence
,
had
not
left
him
a
single
whole
idea
.
He
lived
with
irony
.
*NL*
This
was
his
axiom
:
``
There
is
but
one
certainty
,
my
full
glass
.
''
He
*NL*
sneered
at
all
devotion
in
all
parties
,
the
father
as
well
as
the
*NL*
brother
,
Robespierre
junior
as
well
as
Loizerolles
.
``
They
are
greatly
in
*NL*
advance
to
be
dead
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
He
said
of
the
crucifix
:
``
There
is
a
*NL*
gibbet
which
has
been
a
success
.
''
A
rover
,
a
gambler
,
a
libertine
,
*NL*
often
drunk
,
he
displeased
these
young
dreamers
by
humming
incessantly
:
*NL*
``
J'aimons
les
filles
,
et
j'
aimons
le
bon
vin
.
''
Air
:
Vive
Henri
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
sceptic
had
one
fanaticism
.
This
fanaticism
was
neither
a
*NL*
dogma
,
nor
an
idea
,
nor
an
art
,
nor
a
science
;
it
was
a
man
:
Enjolras
.
*NL*
Grantaire
admired
,
loved
,
and
venerated
Enjolras
.
To
whom
did
this
*NL*
anarchical
scoffer
unite
himself
in
this
phalanx
of
absolute
minds
?
To
*NL*
the
most
absolute
.
In
what
manner
had
Enjolras
subjugated
him
?
By
his
*NL*
ideas
?
No
.
By
his
character
.
A
phenomenon
which
is
often
observable
.
*NL*
A
sceptic
who
adheres
to
a
believer
is
as
simple
as
the
law
of
*NL*
complementary
colors
.
That
which
we
lack
attracts
us
.
No
one
loves
the
*NL*
light
like
the
blind
man
.
The
dwarf
adores
the
drum-major
.
The
toad
*NL*
always
has
his
eyes
fixed
on
heaven
.
Why
?
In
order
to
watch
the
bird
in
*NL*
its
flight
.
Grantaire
,
in
whom
writhed
doubt
,
loved
to
watch
faith
*NL*
soar
in
Enjolras
.
He
had
need
of
Enjolras
.
That
chaste
,
healthy
,
firm
,
*NL*
upright
,
hard
,
candid
nature
charmed
him
,
without
his
being
clearly
*NL*
aware
of
it
,
and
without
the
idea
of
explaining
it
to
himself
having
*NL*
occurred
to
him
.
He
admired
his
opposite
by
instinct
.
His
soft
,
*NL*
yielding
,
dislocated
,
sickly
,
shapeless
ideas
attached
themselves
*NL*
to
Enjolras
as
to
a
spinal
column
.
His
moral
backbone
leaned
on
that
*NL*
firmness
.
Grantaire
in
the
presence
of
Enjolras
became
some
one
once
*NL*
more
.
He
was
,
himself
,
moreover
,
composed
of
two
elements
,
which
were
,
*NL*
to
all
appearance
,
incompatible
.
He
was
ironical
and
cordial
.
His
*NL*
indifference
loved
.
His
mind
could
get
along
without
belief
,
but
his
*NL*
heart
could
not
get
along
without
friendship
.
A
profound
contradiction
;
*NL*
for
an
affection
is
a
conviction
.
His
nature
was
thus
constituted
.
There
*NL*
are
men
who
seem
to
be
born
to
be
the
reverse
,
the
obverse
,
the
wrong
*NL*
side
.
They
are
Pollux
,
Patrocles
,
Nisus
,
Eudamidas
,
Ephestion
,
Pechmeja
.
*NL*
They
only
exist
on
condition
that
they
are
backed
up
with
another
man
;
*NL*
their
name
is
a
sequel
,
and
is
only
written
preceded
by
the
conjunction
*NL*
and
;
and
their
existence
is
not
their
own
;
it
is
the
other
side
of
an
*NL*
existence
which
is
not
theirs
.
Grantaire
was
one
of
these
men
.
He
was
*NL*
the
obverse
of
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
might
almost
say
that
affinities
begin
with
the
letters
of
the
*NL*
alphabet
.
In
the
series
O
and
P
are
inseparable
.
You
can
,
at
will
,
*NL*
pronounce
O
and
P
or
Orestes
and
Pylades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
,
Enjolras
'
true
satellite
,
inhabited
this
circle
of
young
men
;
*NL*
he
lived
there
,
he
took
no
pleasure
anywhere
but
there
;
he
followed
them
*NL*
everywhere
.
His
joy
was
to
see
these
forms
go
and
come
through
the
fumes
*NL*
of
wine
.
They
tolerated
him
on
account
of
his
good
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
the
believer
,
disdained
this
sceptic
;
and
,
a
sober
man
*NL*
himself
,
scorned
this
drunkard
.
He
accorded
him
a
little
lofty
pity
.
*NL*
Grantaire
was
an
unaccepted
Pylades
.
Always
harshly
treated
by
Enjolras
,
*NL*
roughly
repulsed
,
rejected
yet
ever
returning
to
the
charge
,
he
said
of
*NL*
Enjolras
:
``
What
fine
marble
!
''

CHAPTER
II
--
BLONDEAU
'S
FUNERAL
ORATION
BY
BOSSUET
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
certain
afternoon
,
which
had
,
as
will
be
seen
hereafter
,
some
*NL*
coincidence
with
the
events
heretofore
related
,
Laigle
de
Meaux
was
to
*NL*
be
seen
leaning
in
a
sensual
manner
against
the
doorpost
of
the
Cafe
*NL*
Musain
.
He
had
the
air
of
a
caryatid
on
a
vacation
;
he
carried
nothing
*NL*
but
his
revery
,
however
.
He
was
staring
at
the
Place
Saint-Michel
.
*NL*
To
lean
one
's
back
against
a
thing
is
equivalent
to
lying
down
while
*NL*
standing
erect
,
which
attitude
is
not
hated
by
thinkers
.
Laigle
de
Meaux
*NL*
was
pondering
without
melancholy
,
over
a
little
misadventure
which
*NL*
had
befallen
him
two
days
previously
at
the
law-school
,
and
which
had
*NL*
modified
his
personal
plans
for
the
future
,
plans
which
were
rather
*NL*
indistinct
in
any
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revery
does
not
prevent
a
cab
from
passing
by
,
nor
the
dreamer
from
*NL*
taking
note
of
that
cab
.
Laigle
de
Meaux
,
whose
eyes
were
straying
about
*NL*
in
a
sort
of
diffuse
lounging
,
perceived
,
athwart
his
somnambulism
,
a
*NL*
two-wheeled
vehicle
proceeding
through
the
place
,
at
a
foot
pace
and
*NL*
apparently
in
indecision
.
For
whom
was
this
cabriolet
?
Why
was
it
*NL*
driving
at
a
walk
?
Laigle
took
a
survey
.
In
it
,
beside
the
coachman
,
sat
*NL*
a
young
man
,
and
in
front
of
the
young
man
lay
a
rather
bulky
hand-bag
.
*NL*
The
bag
displayed
to
passers-by
the
following
name
inscribed
in
large
*NL*
black
letters
on
a
card
which
was
sewn
to
the
stuff
:
MARIUS
PONTMERCY
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
name
caused
Laigle
to
change
his
attitude
.
He
drew
himself
up
and
*NL*
hurled
this
apostrophe
at
the
young
man
in
the
cabriolet
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Marius
Pontmercy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cabriolet
thus
addressed
came
to
a
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
,
who
also
seemed
deeply
buried
in
thought
,
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
M.
Marius
Pontmercy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
looking
for
you
,
''
resumed
Laigle
de
Meaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
so
?
''
demanded
Marius
;
for
it
was
he
:
in
fact
,
he
had
just
quitted
*NL*
his
grandfather
's
,
and
had
before
him
a
face
which
he
now
beheld
for
the
*NL*
first
time
.
``
I
do
not
know
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
do
I
know
you
,
''
responded
Laigle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
thought
he
had
encountered
a
wag
,
the
beginning
of
a
*NL*
mystification
in
the
open
street
.
He
was
not
in
a
very
good
humor
at
the
*NL*
moment
.
He
frowned
.
Laigle
de
Meaux
went
on
imperturbably
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
not
at
the
school
day
before
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
certain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
student
?
''
demanded
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
Like
yourself
.
Day
before
yesterday
,
I
entered
the
school
,
by
*NL*
chance
.
You
know
,
one
does
have
such
freaks
sometimes
.
The
professor
was
*NL*
just
calling
the
roll
.
You
are
not
unaware
that
they
are
very
ridiculous
*NL*
on
such
occasions
.
At
the
third
call
,
unanswered
,
your
name
is
erased
*NL*
from
the
list
.
Sixty
francs
in
the
gulf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
began
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
Blondeau
who
was
making
the
call
.
You
know
Blondeau
,
he
has
a
*NL*
very
pointed
and
very
malicious
nose
,
and
he
delights
to
scent
out
the
*NL*
absent
.
He
slyly
began
with
the
letter
P.
I
was
not
listening
,
not
being
*NL*
compromised
by
that
letter
.
The
call
was
not
going
badly
.
No
erasures
;
*NL*
the
universe
was
present
.
Blondeau
was
grieved
.
I
said
to
myself
:
*NL*
`
Blondeau
,
my
love
,
you
will
not
get
the
very
smallest
sort
of
an
*NL*
execution
to-day
.
'
All
at
once
Blondeau
calls
,
`
Marius
Pontmercy
!
'
No
*NL*
one
answers
.
Blondeau
,
filled
with
hope
,
repeats
more
loudly
:
`
Marius
*NL*
Pontmercy
!
'
And
he
takes
his
pen
.
Monsieur
,
I
have
bowels
of
compassion
.
*NL*
I
said
to
myself
hastily
:
`
Here
's
a
brave
fellow
who
is
going
to
get
*NL*
scratched
out
.
Attention
.
Here
is
a
veritable
mortal
who
is
not
exact
.
*NL*
He
's
not
a
good
student
.
Here
is
none
of
your
heavy-sides
,
a
student
who
*NL*
studies
,
a
greenhorn
pedant
,
strong
on
letters
,
theology
,
science
,
and
*NL*
sapience
,
one
of
those
dull
wits
cut
by
the
square
;
a
pin
by
profession
.
*NL*
He
is
an
honorable
idler
who
lounges
,
who
practises
country
jaunts
,
who
*NL*
cultivates
the
grisette
,
who
pays
court
to
the
fair
sex
,
who
is
at
*NL*
this
very
moment
,
perhaps
,
with
my
mistress
.
Let
us
save
him
.
Death
to
*NL*
Blondeau
!
'
At
that
moment
,
Blondeau
dipped
his
pen
in
,
all
black
with
*NL*
erasures
in
the
ink
,
cast
his
yellow
eyes
round
the
audience
room
,
and
*NL*
repeated
for
the
third
time
:
`
Marius
Pontmercy
!
'
I
replied
:
`
Present
!
'
*NL*
This
is
why
you
were
not
crossed
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
!
--
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
I
was
,
''
added
Laigle
de
Meaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
understand
you

said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laigle
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
is
more
simple

I
was
close
to
the
desk
to
reply
,
and
close
*NL*
to
the
door
for
the
purpose
of
flight
.
The
professor
gazed
at
me
with
a
*NL*
certain
intensity
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
Blondeau
,
who
must
be
the
malicious
*NL*
nose
alluded
to
by
Boileau
,
skipped
to
the
letter
L.
L
is
my
letter
.
I
*NL*
am
from
Meaux
,

my
name
is
Lesgle

*NL*
*NL*
``

Marius

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur

to
this
fine
name

called

I
*NL*
reply

Then
Blondeau
gazes
at
me
,
with
the
gentleness
of
a
*NL*
tiger
,
and
says
to
me
:
`
If
you

you

not
Laigle

A
*NL*
phrase
which
has
a
disobliging
air
for
you
,
but
which
was
lugubrious
*NL*
only
for
me

That
said
,
he
crossed
me
off

*NL*
Marius
exclaimed
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
mortified

``
First

Laigle

``
I

phrases

felt
eulogium

I

There

no

change
required
in

gauntness

Laigle
burst
out
laughing

*NL*
``

delighted

CHAPTER
III
--
MARIUS
'
ASTONISHMENTS
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
days
,
Marius
had
become
Courfeyrac
's
friend
.
Youth
is
the
*NL*
season
for
prompt
welding
and
the
rapid
healing
of
scars
.
Marius
*NL*
breathed
freely
in
Courfeyrac
's
society
,
a
decidedly
new
thing
for
him
.
*NL*
Courfeyrac
put
no
questions
to
him
.
He
did
not
even
think
of
such
a
*NL*
thing
.
At
that
age
,
faces
disclose
everything
on
the
spot
.
Words
are
*NL*
superfluous
.
There
are
young
men
of
whom
it
can
be
said
that
their
*NL*
countenances
chatter
.
One
looks
at
them
and
one
knows
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
however
,
Courfeyrac
abruptly
addressed
this
interrogation
*NL*
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
have
you
any
political
opinions
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
!
''
said
Marius
,
almost
affronted
by
the
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
democrat-Bonapartist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gray
hue
of
a
reassured
rat
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
Courfeyrac
introduced
Marius
at
the
Cafe
Musain
.
*NL*
Then
he
whispered
in
his
ear
,
with
a
smile
:
``
I
must
give
you
your
entry
*NL*
to
the
revolution
.
''
And
he
led
him
to
the
hall
of
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
*NL*
C
.
He
presented
him
to
the
other
comrades
,
saying
this
simple
word
which
*NL*
Marius
did
not
understand
:
``
A
pupil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
fallen
into
a
wasps
'
-
nest
of
wits
.
However
,
although
he
was
*NL*
silent
and
grave
,
he
was
,
none
the
less
,
both
winged
and
armed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
up
to
that
time
solitary
and
inclined
to
soliloquy
,
and
to
*NL*
asides
,
both
by
habit
and
by
taste
,
was
a
little
fluttered
by
this
covey
*NL*
of
young
men
around
him
.
All
these
various
initiatives
solicited
his
*NL*
attention
at
once
,
and
pulled
him
about
.
The
tumultuous
movements
of
*NL*
these
minds
at
liberty
and
at
work
set
his
ideas
in
a
whirl
.
Sometimes
,
*NL*
in
his
trouble
,
they
fled
so
far
from
him
,
that
he
had
difficulty
in
*NL*
recovering
them
.
He
heard
them
talk
of
philosophy
,
of
literature
,
of
*NL*
art
,
of
history
,
of
religion
,
in
unexpected
fashion
.
He
caught
glimpses
*NL*
of
strange
aspects
;
and
,
as
he
did
not
place
them
in
proper
perspective
,
*NL*
he
was
not
altogether
sure
that
it
was
not
chaos
that
he
grasped
.
On
*NL*
abandoning
his
grandfather
's
opinions
for
the
opinions
of
his
father
,
*NL*
he
had
supposed
himself
fixed
;
he
now
suspected
,
with
uneasiness
,
and
*NL*
without
daring
to
avow
it
to
himself
,
that
he
was
not
.
The
angle
*NL*
at
which
he
saw
everything
began
to
be
displaced
anew
.
A
certain
*NL*
oscillation
set
all
the
horizons
of
his
brains
in
motion
.
An
odd
*NL*
internal
upsetting
.
He
almost
suffered
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
as
though
there
were
no
``
consecrated
things
''
for
those
young
*NL*
men
.
Marius
heard
singular
propositions
on
every
sort
of
subject
,
which
*NL*
embarrassed
his
still
timid
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
theatre
poster
presented
itself
,
adorned
with
the
title
of
a
tragedy
*NL*
from
the
ancient
repertory
called
classic
:
``
Down
with
tragedy
dear
to
*NL*
the
bourgeois
!
''
cried
Bahorel
.
And
Marius
heard
Combeferre
reply
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wrong
,
Bahorel
.
The
bourgeoisie
loves
tragedy
,
and
the
*NL*
bourgeoisie
must
be
left
at
peace
on
that
score
.
Bewigged
tragedy
has
*NL*
a
reason
for
its
existence
,
and
I
am
not
one
of
those
who
,
by
order
of
*NL*
AEschylus
,
contest
its
right
to
existence
.
There
are
rough
outlines
in
*NL*
nature
;
there
are
,
in
creation
,
ready-made
parodies
;
a
beak
which
is
not
*NL*
a
beak
,
wings
which
are
not
wings
,
gills
which
are
not
gills
,
paws
which
*NL*
are
not
paws
,
a
cry
of
pain
which
arouses
a
desire
to
laugh
,
there
is
*NL*
the
duck
.
Now
,
since
poultry
exists
by
the
side
of
the
bird
,
I
do
*NL*
not
see
why
classic
tragedy
should
not
exist
in
the
face
of
antique
*NL*
tragedy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Or
chance
decreed
that
Marius
should
traverse
Rue
Jean-Jacques
Rousseau
*NL*
between
Enjolras
and
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
took
his
arm
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pay
attention
.
This
is
the
Rue
Platriere
,
now
called
Rue
Jean-Jacques
*NL*
Rousseau
,
on
account
of
a
singular
household
which
lived
in
it
sixty
*NL*
years
ago
.
This
consisted
of
Jean-Jacques
and
Therese
.
From
time
*NL*
to
time
,
little
beings
were
born
there
.
Therese
gave
birth
to
them
,
*NL*
Jean-Jacques
represented
them
as
foundlings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Enjolras
addressed
Courfeyrac
roughly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
in
the
presence
of
Jean-Jacques
!
I
admire
that
man
.
He
denied
*NL*
his
own
children
,
that
may
be
;
but
he
adopted
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
one
of
these
young
men
articulated
the
word
:
The
Emperor
.
*NL*
Jean
Prouvaire
alone
sometimes
said
Napoleon
;
all
the
others
said
*NL*
``
Bonaparte
.
''
Enjolras
pronounced
it
``
Buonaparte
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
vaguely
surprised
.
Initium
sapientiae

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
BACK
ROOM
OF
THE
CAFE
MUSAIN
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
conversations
among
the
young
men
,
at
which
Marius
was
*NL*
present
and
in
which
he
sometimes
joined
,
was
a
veritable
shock
to
his
*NL*
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
place
in
the
back
room
of
the
Cafe
Musain
.
Nearly
all
the
*NL*
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
had
convened
that
evening
.
The
argand
lamp
was
*NL*
solemnly
lighted
.
They
talked
of
one
thing
and
another
,
without
passion
*NL*
and
with
noise
.
With
the
exception
of
Enjolras
and
Marius
,
who
held
*NL*
their
peace
,
all
were
haranguing
rather
at
hap-hazard
.
Conversations
*NL*
between
comrades
sometimes
are
subject
to
these
peaceable
tumults
.
It
*NL*
was
a
game
and
an
uproar
as
much
as
a
conversation
.
They
tossed
words
*NL*
to
each
other
and
caught
them
up
in
turn
.
They
were
chattering
in
all
*NL*
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
woman
was
admitted
to
this
back
room
,
except
Louison
,
the
dish-washer
*NL*
of
the
cafe
,
who
passed
through
it
from
time
to
time
,
to
go
to
her
*NL*
washing
in
the
``
lavatory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
,
thoroughly
drunk
,
was
deafening
the
corner
of
which
he
had
*NL*
taken
possession
,
reasoning
and
contradicting
at
the
top
of
his
lungs
,
*NL*
and
shouting
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
thirsty
.
Mortals
,
I
am
dreaming
:
that
the
tun
of
Heidelberg
has
an
*NL*
attack
of
apoplexy
,
and
that
I
am
one
of
the
dozen
leeches
which
will
*NL*
be
applied
to
it
.
I
want
a
drink
.
I
desire
to
forget
life
.
Life
is
a
*NL*
hideous
invention
of
I
know
not
whom
.
It
lasts
no
time
at
all
,
and
is
*NL*
worth
nothing
.
One
breaks
one
's
neck
in
living
.
Life
is
a
theatre
set
in
*NL*
which
there
are
but
few
practicable
entrances
.
Happiness
is
an
antique
*NL*
reliquary
painted
on
one
side
only
.
Ecclesiastes
says
:
`
All
is
vanity
.
'
*NL*
I
agree
with
that
good
man
,
who
never
existed
,
perhaps
.
Zero
not
wishing
*NL*
to
go
stark
naked
,
clothed
himself
in
vanity
.
O
vanity
!
The
patching
up
*NL*
of
everything
with
big
words
!
a
kitchen
is
a
laboratory
,
a
dancer
is
a
*NL*
professor
,
an
acrobat
is
a
gymnast
,
a
boxer
is
a
pugilist
,
an
apothecary
*NL*
is
a
chemist
,
a
wigmaker
is
an
artist
,
a
hodman
is
an
architect
,
a
*NL*
jockey
is
a
sportsman
,
a
wood-louse
is
a
pterigybranche
.
Vanity
has
a
*NL*
right
and
a
wrong
side
;
the
right
side
is
stupid
,
it
is
the
negro
with
*NL*
his
glass
beads
;
the
wrong
side
is
foolish
,
it
is
the
philosopher
with
*NL*
his
rags
.
I
weep
over
the
one
and
I
laugh
over
the
other
.
What
are
*NL*
called
honors
and
dignities
,
and
even
dignity
and
honor
,
are
generally
*NL*
of
pinchbeck
.
Kings
make
playthings
of
human
pride
.
Caligula
made
a
*NL*
horse
a
consul
;
Charles
II
.
made
a
knight
of
a
sirloin
.
Wrap
yourself
*NL*
up
now
,
then
,
between
Consul
Incitatus
and
Baronet
Roastbeef
.
As
for
*NL*
the
intrinsic
value
of
people
,
it
is
no
longer
respectable
in
the
least
.
*NL*
Listen
to
the
panegyric
which
neighbor
makes
of
neighbor
.
White
on
white
*NL*
is
ferocious
;
if
the
lily
could
speak
,
what
a
setting
down
it
would
give
*NL*
the
dove
!
A
bigoted
woman
prating
of
a
devout
woman
is
more
venomous
*NL*
than
the
asp
and
the
cobra
.
It
is
a
shame
that
I
am
ignorant
,
otherwise
*NL*
I
would
quote
to
you
a
mass
of
things
;
but
I
know
nothing
.
For
instance
,
*NL*
I
have
always
been
witty
;
when
I
was
a
pupil
of
Gros
,
instead
of
*NL*
daubing
wretched
little
pictures
,
I
passed
my
time
in
pilfering
apples
;
*NL*
rapin
-LSB-
24
-RSB-
is
the
masculine
of
rapine
.
So
much
for
myself
;
as
for
*NL*
the
rest
of
you
,
you
are
worth
no
more
than
I
am
.
I
scoff
at
your
*NL*
perfections
,
excellencies
,
and
qualities
.
Every
good
quality
tends
*NL*
towards
a
defect
;
economy
borders
on
avarice
,
the
generous
man
is
next
*NL*
door
to
the
prodigal
,
the
brave
man
rubs
elbows
with
the
braggart
;
he
*NL*
who
says
very
pious
says
a
trifle
bigoted
;
there
are
just
as
many
vices
*NL*
in
virtue
as
there
are
holes
in
Diogenes
'
cloak
.
Whom
do
you
admire
,
the
*NL*
slain
or
the
slayer
,
Caesar
or
Brutus
?
Generally
men
are
in
favor
of
the
*NL*
slayer
.
Long
live
Brutus
,
he
has
slain
!
There
lies
the
virtue
.
Virtue
,
*NL*
granted
,
but
madness
also
.
There
are
queer
spots
on
those
great
men
.
The
*NL*
Brutus
who
killed
Caesar
was
in
love
with
the
statue
of
a
little
boy
.
*NL*
This
statue
was
from
the
hand
of
the
Greek
sculptor
Strongylion
,
*NL*
who
also
carved
that
figure
of
an
Amazon
known
as
the
Beautiful
Leg
,
*NL*
Eucnemos
,
which
Nero
carried
with
him
in
his
travels
.
This
Strongylion
*NL*
left
but
two
statues
which
placed
Nero
and
Brutus
in
accord
.
Brutus
was
*NL*
in
love
with
the
one
,
Nero
with
the
other
.
All
history
is
nothing
but
*NL*
wearisome
repetition
.
One
century
is
the
plagiarist
of
the
other
.
The
*NL*
battle
of
Marengo
copies
the
battle
of
Pydna
;
the
Tolbiac
of
Clovis
and
*NL*
the
Austerlitz
of
Napoleon
are
as
like
each
other
as
two
drops
of
water
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
attach
much
importance
to
victory
.
Nothing
is
so
stupid
as
to
*NL*
conquer
;
true
glory
lies
in
convincing
.
But
try
to
prove
something
!
If
*NL*
you
are
content
with
success
,
what
mediocrity
,
and
with
conquering
,
what
*NL*
wretchedness
!
Alas
,
vanity
and
cowardice
everywhere
.
Everything
obeys
*NL*
success
,
even
grammar
.
Si
volet
usus
,
says
Horace
.
Therefore
I
disdain
*NL*
the
human
race
.
Shall
we
descend
to
the
party
at
all
?
Do
you
wish
me
*NL*
to
begin
admiring
the
peoples
?
What
people
,
if
you
please
?
Shall
it
be
*NL*
Greece
?
The
Athenians
,
those
Parisians
of
days
gone
by
,
slew
Phocion
,
*NL*
as
we
might
say
Coligny
,
and
fawned
upon
tyrants
to
such
an
extent
that
*NL*
Anacephorus
said
of
Pisistratus
:
``
His
urine
attracts
the
bees
.
''
The
most
*NL*
prominent
man
in
Greece
for
fifty
years
was
that
grammarian
Philetas
,
*NL*
who
was
so
small
and
so
thin
that
he
was
obliged
to
load
his
shoes
with
*NL*
lead
in
order
not
to
be
blown
away
by
the
wind
.
There
stood
on
the
great
*NL*
square
in
Corinth
a
statue
carved
by
Silanion
and
catalogued
by
Pliny
;
*NL*
this
statue
represented
Episthates
.
What
did
Episthates
do
?
He
invented
*NL*
a
trip
.
That
sums
up
Greece
and
glory
.
Let
us
pass
on
to
others
.
Shall
I
*NL*
admire
England
?
Shall
I
admire
France
?
France
?
Why
?
Because
of
Paris
?
*NL*
I
have
just
told
you
my
opinion
of
Athens
.
England
?
Why
?
Because
of
*NL*
London
?
I
hate
Carthage
.
And
then
,
London
,
the
metropolis
of
luxury
,
is
*NL*
the
headquarters
of
wretchedness
.
There
are
a
hundred
deaths
a
year
of
*NL*
hunger
in
the
parish
of
Charing-Cross
alone
.
Such
is
Albion
.
I
add
,
*NL*
as
the
climax
,
that
I
have
seen
an
Englishwoman
dancing
in
a
wreath
of
*NL*
roses
and
blue
spectacles
.
A
fig
then
for
England
!
If
I
do
not
admire
*NL*
John
Bull
,
shall
I
admire
Brother
Jonathan
?
I
have
but
little
taste
for
*NL*
that
slave-holding
brother
.
Take
away
Time
is
money
,
what
remains
of
*NL*
England
?
Take
away
Cotton
is
king
,
what
remains
of
America
?
Germany
is
*NL*
the
lymph
,
Italy
is
the
bile
.
Shall
we
go
into
ecstasies
over
Russia
?
*NL*
Voltaire
admired
it
.
He
also
admired
China
.
I
admit
that
Russia
has
its
*NL*
beauties
,
among
others
,
a
stout
despotism
;
but
I
pity
the
despots
.
*NL*
Their
health
is
delicate
.
A
decapitated
Alexis
,
a
poignarded
Peter
,
*NL*
a
strangled
Paul
,
another
Paul

`
Bah

you

Europe

I
admit
that
Asia
is
a

farce
;

I
do
not
precisely
see
what
you
find
to

you

Gentlemen
*NL*
of

human
race
,
I
tell
you
,
not
a

of
it

It
is
at

there
are

all

Paris
carries
the

,
in

.
In

,
*NL*
even
the

Diogenes
would
have
loved
to
be

better
than
to

Piraeus

Learn
this

Thus
did
Grantaire
,
more
than
intoxicated
,
launch
into
speech
,
catching
*NL*
at
the
dish-washer
in
her
passage
,
from
his
corner
in

room

the
Cafe
Musain

*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
,
extending
his
hand
towards
him
,
tried
to
impose
silence
on
him
,
*NL*
and
Grantaire
began
again
worse
than
ever
:

who
was
plunged
more

high

which
this

the
conclusion

*NL*
Near

an

silent
table

a
sheet
of
paper

an

*NL*
and
a
pen
between
two
glasses
of
brandy

announced
that
a
vaudeville
was
*NL*
being
sketched
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
great
affair
was
being
discussed
in
a
low
voice
,
and
the
two
heads
*NL*
at
work
touched
each
other
:
``
Let

begin
by

Beside
the
vaudeville
aspirants
,
another
group
,
which
was
also
taking
*NL*
advantage
of
the
uproar
to
talk
low
,
was
discussing
a
duel
.
An
old
*NL*
fellow
of
thirty
was
counselling
a
young
one
of
eighteen

explaining
*NL*
to
him
what
sort

adversary

had
to
deal

*NL*
*NL*
``

In

angle
opposite
Grantaire

Joly

playing

talking

*NL*
*NL*
``

Joly

*NL*
``
That

hers

returned
Bahorel

``
One

wrong

one

The
third
corner
was
delivered
up
to
a
poetical
discussion
.
Pagan
*NL*
mythology
was
giving
battle
to
Christian
mythology
.
The
question
was
*NL*
about
Olympus
,
whose
part
was
taken
by
Jean
Prouvaire
,
out
of
pure
*NL*
romanticism
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Prouvaire
was
timid
only
in
repose
.
Once
excited
,
he
burst
forth
,
*NL*
a
sort
of
mirth
accentuated
his
enthusiasm
,
and
he
was
at
once
both
*NL*
laughing
and
lyric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
not
insult
the
gods
,
''
said
he
.
``
The
gods
may
not
have
taken
*NL*
their
departure
.
Jupiter
does
not
impress
me
as
dead
.
The
gods
are
*NL*
dreams
,
you
say
.
Well
,
even
in
nature
,
such
as
it
is
to-day
,
after
the
*NL*
flight
of
these
dreams
,
we
still
find
all
the
grand
old
pagan
myths
.
*NL*
Such
and
such
a
mountain
with
the
profile
of
a
citadel
,
like
the
*NL*
Vignemale
,
for
example
,
is
still
to
me
the
headdress
of
Cybele
;
it
has
*NL*
not
been
proved
to
me
that
Pan
does
not
come
at
night
to
breathe
into
*NL*
the
hollow
trunks
of
the
willows
,
stopping
up
the
holes
in
turn
with
his
*NL*
fingers
,
and
I
have
always
believed
that

had
something
to
do

In
the
last
corner
,
they
were
talking
politics
.
The
Charter
which
had
*NL*
been
granted
was
getting
roughly
handled
.
Combeferre
was
upholding
it
*NL*
weakly
.
Courfeyrac
was
energetically
making
a
breach
in
it
.
On
the
table
*NL*
lay
an
unfortunate
copy
of
the
famous
Touquet
Charter
.
Courfeyrac
had
*NL*
seized
it
,
and
was
brandishing
it
,
mingling
with
his
arguments
the
*NL*
rattling
of
this
sheet
of
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
I
wo
n't
have
any
kings
;
if
it
were
only
from
an
*NL*
economical
point
of
view
,
I
do
n't
want
any
;
a
king
is
a
parasite
.
One
*NL*
does
not
have
kings
gratis
.
Listen
to
this
:
the
dearness
of
kings
.
At
*NL*
the
death
of
Francois
I.
,
the
national
debt
of
France
amounted
to
an
*NL*
income
of
thirty
thousand
livres
;
at
the
death
of
Louis
XIV
.
it
was
two
*NL*
milliards
,
six
hundred
millions
,
at
twenty-eight
livres
the
mark
,
which
*NL*
was
equivalent
in
1760
,
according
to
Desmarets
,
to
four
milliards
,
five
*NL*
hundred
millions
,
which
would
to-day
be
equivalent
to
twelve
milliards

*NL*
In
the
second
place

and
no
offence
to
Combeferre
,
a
charter
granted
is
*NL*
but
a
poor
expedient
of
civilization

To
save
the
transition
,
to
soften
*NL*
the
passage
,
to
deaden
the
shock
,
to
cause
the
nation
to
pass
insensibly
*NL*
from
the
monarchy
to
democracy
by
the
practice
of
constitutional
*NL*
fictions

what
detestable
reasons
all
those
are

No

never

pale

no

side
of
the
hand
which
gives
there
is
the
claw
which
snatches

back

I
refuse
your
charter
point-blank

A
charter
is
a
mask

the
lie

lurks
beneath
it

A
people
which
accepts
a

abdicates

It
was
winter
;
a
couple
of
fagots
were
crackling
in
the
fireplace
.
This
*NL*
was
tempting
,
and
Courfeyrac
could
not
resist
.
He
crumpled
the
poor
*NL*
Touquet
Charter
in
his
fist
,
and
flung
it
in
the
fire
.
The
paper
*NL*
flashed
up
.
Combeferre
watched
the
masterpiece
of
Louis
XVIII

burn
*NL*
philosophically
,

contented
himself
with
saying
:

And
sarcasms

all
the
wild
pyrotechnics
of
dialogue

mounting

together

crossing

CHAPTER
V
--
ENLARGEMENT
OF
HORIZON
*NL*
*NL*
The
shocks
of
youthful
minds
among
themselves
have
this
admirable
*NL*
property
,
that
one
can
never
foresee
the
spark
,
nor
divine
the
lightning
*NL*
flash
.
What
will
dart
out
presently
?
No
one
knows
.
The
burst
of
laughter
*NL*
starts
from
a
tender
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
of
jest
,
the
serious
makes
its
entry
.
Impulses
depend
on
*NL*
the
first
chance
word
.
The
spirit
of
each
is
sovereign
,
jest
suffices
*NL*
to
open
the
field
to
the
unexpected
.
These
are
conversations
with
*NL*
abrupt
turns
,
in
which
the
perspective
changes
suddenly
.
Chance
is
the
*NL*
stage-manager
of
such
conversations
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
severe
thought
,
starting
oddly
from
a
clash
of
words
,
suddenly
*NL*
traversed
the
conflict
of
quips
in
which
Grantaire
,
Bahorel
,
Prouvaire
,
*NL*
Bossuet
,
Combeferre
,
and
Courfeyrac
were
confusedly
fencing
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
does
a
phrase
crop
up
in
a
dialogue
?
Whence
comes
it
that
it
*NL*
suddenly
impresses
itself
on
the
attention
of
those
who
hear
it
?
We
*NL*
have
just
said
,
that
no
one
knows
anything
about
it
.
In
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
uproar
,
Bossuet
all
at
once
terminated
some
apostrophe
to
Combeferre
,
*NL*

``
June
18th

Waterloo

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
name
of
Waterloo
,
Marius
,
who
was
leaning
his
elbows
on
a
table
,
*NL*
beside
a
glass
of
water
,
removed
his
wrist
from
beneath
his
chin
,
and
*NL*
began
to
gaze
fixedly
at
the
audience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
!
''
exclaimed
Courfeyrac
-LRB-
``
Parbleu
''
was
falling
into
disuse
*NL*
at
this
period
-RRB-
,
``
that
number
18
is
strange
and
strikes
me
.
It
is
*NL*
Bonaparte
's
fatal
number
.
Place
Louis
in
front
and
Brumaire
behind
,
you
*NL*
have
the
whole
destiny
of
the
man
,
with
this
significant
peculiarity
,
*NL*
that
the
end
treads
close
on
the
heels
of
the
commencement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
who
had
remained
mute
up
to
that
point
,
broke
the
silence
and
*NL*
addressed
this
remark
to
Combeferre
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
to
say
,
the
crime
and
the
expiation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
crime
overpassed
the
measure
of
what
Marius
,
who
was
already
*NL*
greatly
agitated
by
the
abrupt
evocation
of
Waterloo
,
could
accept
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
walked
slowly
to
the
map
of
France
spread
out
on
the
wall
,
and
*NL*
at
whose
base
an
island
was
visible
in
a
separate
compartment
,
laid
his
*NL*
finger
on
this
compartment
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Corsica
,
a
little
island
which
has
rendered
France
very
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
like
a
breath
of
icy
air
.
All
ceased
talking
.
They
felt
that
*NL*
something
was
on
the
point
of
occurring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
,
replying
to
Bossuet
,
was
just
assuming
an
attitude
of
the
torso
*NL*
to
which
he
was
addicted
.
He
gave
it
up
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
whose
blue
eye
was
not
fixed
on
any
one
,
and
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
gazing
at
space
,
replied
,
without
glancing
at
Marius
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
France
needs
no
Corsica
to
be
great
.
France
is
great
because
she
is
*NL*
France
.
Quia
nomina
leo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
felt
no
desire
to
retreat
;
he
turned
towards
Enjolras
,
and
his
*NL*
voice
burst
forth
with
a
vibration
which
came
from
a
quiver
of
his
very
*NL*
being
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
that
I
should
diminish
France
!
But
amalgamating
Napoleon
*NL*
with
her
is
not
diminishing
her
.
Come
!
let
us
argue
the
question
.
I
am
*NL*
a
new
comer
among
you
,
but
I
will
confess
that
you
amaze
me
.
Where
do
we
*NL*
stand
?
Who
are
we
?
Who
are
you
?
Who
am
I
?
Let
us
come
to
an
explanation
*NL*
about
the
Emperor
.
I
hear
you
say
Buonaparte
,
accenting
the
u
like
the
*NL*
Royalists
.
I
warn
you
that
my
grandfather
does
better
still
;
he
*NL*
says
Buonaparte
'
.
I
thought
you
were
young
men
.
Where
,
then
,
is
your
*NL*
enthusiasm
?
And
what
are
you
doing
with
it
?
Whom
do
you
admire
,
if
you
*NL*
do
not
admire
the
Emperor
?
And
what
more
do
you
want
?
If
you
will
*NL*
have
none
of
that
great
man
,
what
great
men
would
you
like
?
He
had
*NL*
everything
.
He
was
complete
.
He
had
in
his
brain
the
sum
of
human
*NL*
faculties
.
He
made
codes
like
Justinian
,
he
dictated
like
Caesar
,
his
*NL*
conversation
was
mingled
with
the
lightning-flash
of
Pascal
,
with
the
*NL*
thunderclap
of
Tacitus
,
he
made
history
and
he
wrote
it
,
his
bulletins
*NL*
are
Iliads
,
he
combined
the
cipher
of
Newton
with
the
metaphor
of
*NL*
Mahomet
,
he
left
behind
him
in
the
East
words
as
great
as
the
pyramids
,
*NL*
at
Tilsit
he
taught
Emperors
majesty
,
at
the
Academy
of
Sciences
he
*NL*
replied
to
Laplace
,
in
the
Council
of
State
be
held
his
own
against
*NL*
Merlin
,
he
gave
a
soul
to
the
geometry
of
the
first
,
and
to
the
*NL*
chicanery
of
the
last
,
he
was
a
legist
with
the
attorneys
and
sidereal
*NL*
with
the
astronomers
;
like
Cromwell
blowing
out
one
of
two
candles
,
he
*NL*
went
to
the
Temple
to
bargain
for
a
curtain
tassel
;
he
saw
everything
;
*NL*
he
knew
everything
;
which
did
not
prevent
him
from
laughing
*NL*
good-naturedly
beside
the
cradle
of
his
little
child
;
and
all
at
once
,
*NL*
frightened
Europe
lent
an
ear
,
armies
put
themselves
in
motion
,
parks
of
*NL*
artillery
rumbled
,
pontoons
stretched
over
the
rivers
,
clouds
of
cavalry
*NL*
galloped
in
the
storm
,
cries
,
trumpets
,
a
trembling
of
thrones
in
every
*NL*
direction
,
the
frontiers
of
kingdoms
oscillated
on
the
map
,
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
superhuman
sword
was
heard
,
as
it
was
drawn
from
its
sheath
;
they
*NL*
beheld
him
,
him
,
rise
erect
on
the
horizon
with
a
blazing
brand
in
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
a
glow
in
his
eyes
,
unfolding
amid
the
thunder
,
his
two
wings
,
*NL*
the
grand
army
and
the
old
guard
,
and
he
was
the
archangel
of
war
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
held
their
peace
,
and
Enjolras
bowed
his
head
.
Silence
always
*NL*
produces
somewhat
the
effect
of
acquiescence
,
of
the
enemy
being
driven
*NL*
to
the
wall
.
Marius
continued
with
increased
enthusiasm
,
and
almost
*NL*
without
pausing
for
breath
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
just
,
my
friends
!
What
a
splendid
destiny
for
a
nation
to
be
*NL*
the
Empire
of
such
an
Emperor
,
when
that
nation
is
France
and
when
it
*NL*
adds
its
own
genius
to
the
genius
of
that
man
!
To
appear
and
to
reign
,
*NL*
to
march
and
to
triumph
,
to
have
for
halting-places
all
capitals
,
to
*NL*
take
his
grenadiers
and
to
make
kings
of
them
,
to
decree
the
falls
of
*NL*
dynasties
,
and
to
transfigure
Europe
at
the
pace
of
a
charge
;
to
make
*NL*
you
feel
that
when
you
threaten
you
lay
your
hand
on
the
hilt
of
the
*NL*
sword
of
God
;
to
follow
in
a
single
man
,
Hannibal
,
Caesar
,
Charlemagne
;
*NL*
to
be
the
people
of
some
one
who
mingles
with
your
dawns
the
startling
*NL*
announcement
of
a
battle
won
,
to
have
the
cannon
of
the
Invalides
to
*NL*
rouse
you
in
the
morning
,
to
hurl
into
abysses
of
light
prodigious
words
*NL*
which
flame
forever
,
Marengo
,
Arcola
,
Austerlitz
,
Jena
,
Wagram
!
To
cause
*NL*
constellations
of
victories
to
flash
forth
at
each
instant
from
the
*NL*
zenith
of
the
centuries
,
to
make
the
French
Empire
a
pendant
to
the
*NL*
Roman
Empire
,
to
be
the
great
nation
and
to
give
birth
to
the
grand
*NL*
army
,
to
make
its
legions
fly
forth
over
all
the
earth
,
as
a
mountain
*NL*
sends
out
its
eagles
on
all
sides
to
conquer
,
to
dominate
,
to
strike
*NL*
with
lightning
,
to
be
in
Europe
a
sort
of
nation
gilded
through
glory
,
*NL*
to
sound
athwart
the
centuries
a
trumpet-blast
of
Titans
,
to
conquer
*NL*
the
world
twice
,
by
conquest
and
by
dazzling
,
that
is
sublime
;
and
what
*NL*
greater
thing
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
free
,
''
said
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
lowered
his
head
in
his
turn
;
that
cold
and
simple
word
had
*NL*
traversed
his
epic
effusion
like
a
blade
of
steel
,
and
he
felt
it
*NL*
vanishing
within
him
.
When
he
raised
his
eyes
,
Combeferre
was
no
longer
*NL*
there
.
Probably
satisfied
with
his
reply
to
the
apotheosis
,
he
had
*NL*
just
taken
his
departure
,
and
all
,
with
the
exception
of
Enjolras
,
*NL*
had
followed
him
.
The
room
had
been
emptied
.
Enjolras
,
left
alone
with
*NL*
Marius
,
was
gazing
gravely
at
him
.
Marius
,
however
,
having
rallied
his
*NL*
ideas
to
some
extent
,
did
not
consider
himself
beaten
;
there
lingered
in
*NL*
him
a
trace
of
inward
fermentation
which
was
on
the
point
,
no
doubt
,
of
*NL*
translating
itself
into
syllogisms
arrayed
against
Enjolras
,
when
all
of
*NL*
a
sudden
,
they
heard
some
one
singing
on
the
stairs
as
he
went
.
It
was
*NL*
Combeferre
,
and
this
is
what
he
was
singing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Si

avait

qu'il

Je

o

*NL*
J'aime

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
wild
and
tender
accents
with
which
Combeferre
sang
communicated
to
*NL*
this
couplet
a
sort
of
strange
grandeur
.
Marius
,
thoughtfully
,
and
*NL*
with
his
eyes
diked
on
the
ceiling
,
repeated
almost
mechanically
:
``
My
*NL*
mother
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
felt
Enjolras
'
hand
on
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizen

said
Enjolras
to
him
,
``

CHAPTER
VI
--
RES
ANGUSTA
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
left
Marius
profoundly
shaken
,
and
with
a
melancholy
shadow
*NL*
in
his
soul
.
He
felt
what
the
earth
may
possibly
feel
,
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
it
is
torn
open
with
the
iron
,
in
order
that
grain
may
be
deposited
*NL*
within
it
;
it
feels
only
the
wound
;
the
quiver
of
the
germ
and
the
joy
*NL*
of
the
fruit
only
arrive
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
gloomy
.
He
had
but
just
acquired
a
faith
;
must
he
then
reject
*NL*
it
already
?
He
affirmed
to
himself
that
he
would
not
.
He
declared
to
*NL*
himself
that
he
would
not
doubt
,
and
he
began
to
doubt
in
spite
of
*NL*
himself
.
To
stand
between
two
religions
,
from
one
of
which
you
have
*NL*
not
as
yet
emerged
,
and
another
into
which
you
have
not
yet
entered
,
is
*NL*
intolerable
;
and
twilight
is
pleasing
only
to
bat-like
souls
.
Marius
*NL*
was
clear-eyed
,
and
he
required
the
true
light
.
The
half-lights
of
doubt
*NL*
pained
him
.
Whatever
may
have
been
his
desire
to
remain
where
he
was
,
*NL*
he
could
not
halt
there
,
he
was
irresistibly
constrained
to
continue
,
to
*NL*
advance
,
to
examine
,
to
think
,
to
march
further
.
Whither
would
this
lead
*NL*
him
?
He
feared
,
after
having
taken
so
many
steps
which
had
brought
him
*NL*
nearer
to
his
father
,
to
now
take
a
step
which
should
estrange
him
from
*NL*
that
father
.
His
discomfort
was
augmented
by
all
the
reflections
which
*NL*
occurred
to
him
.
An
escarpment
rose
around
him
.
He
was
in
accord
neither
*NL*
with
his
grandfather
nor
with
his
friends
;
daring
in
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
one
,
he
was
behind
the
times
in
the
eyes
of
the
others
,
and
he
*NL*
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
doubly
isolated
,
on
the
side
of
age
and
*NL*
on
the
side
of
youth
.
He
ceased
to
go
to
the
Cafe
Musain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
troubled
state
of
his
conscience
,
he
no
longer
thought
of
*NL*
certain
serious
sides
of
existence
.
The
realities
of
life
do
not
allow
*NL*
themselves
to
be
forgotten
.
They
soon
elbowed
him
abruptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
the
proprietor
of
the
hotel
entered
Marius
'
room
and
said
*NL*
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Courfeyrac
answered
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
have
my
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Request
Courfeyrac
to
come
and
talk
with
me
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
having
made
his
appearance
,
the
host
left
them
.
Marius
then
*NL*
told
him
what
it
had
not
before
occurred
to
him
to
relate
,
that
he
was
*NL*
the
same
as
alone
in
the
world
,
and
had
no
relatives
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
become
of
you
?
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
in
the
least

replied
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going
to
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
francs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
to
lend
you
some
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
clothes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
what
I
have

``
Have
you
trinkets

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
watch

``
Silver

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gold
;
here
it
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
a
clothes-dealer
who
will
take
your
frock-coat
and
a
pair
of
*NL*
trousers

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
then
have
only
a
pair
of
trousers

a
waistcoat

a
hat
and

coat

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
boots

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!

will
not
go
barefoot

What
opulence

``
That
will

enough

``

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever

Anything
honest

is
to

*NL*
``
Do

*NL*

``
No

``

*NL*
``

worse

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
one
of
my
friends

In

The
clothes-dealer
was
sent
for
.
He
paid
twenty
francs
for
the
cast-off
*NL*
garments
.
They
went
to
the
watchmaker
's
.
He
bought
the
watch
for
*NL*
forty-five
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That

said
Marius
to
Courfeyrac
,
on
their
return
to
the
*NL*
hotel

Courfeyrac

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
I
had
forgotten

said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
landlord
presented
his
bill
,
which
had
to
be
paid
on
the
spot
.
It
*NL*
amounted
to
seventy
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
ten
francs
left

said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce

exclaimed
Courfeyrac
,
``
you
will
eat
up
five
francs

*NL*
you
are
learning
English

five

be
*NL*

very
slowly

*NL*
In
the
meantime
Aunt
Gillenormand
,
a
rather
good-hearted
person
at
*NL*
bottom
in
difficulties
,
had
finally
hunted
up
Marius
'
abode
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
on
his
return
from
the
law-school
,
Marius
found
a
letter
*NL*
from
his
aunt
,
and
the
sixty
pistoles
,
that
is
to
say
,
six
hundred
*NL*
francs
in
gold
,
in
a
sealed
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
sent
back
the
thirty
louis
to
his
aunt
,
with
a
respectful
letter
,
*NL*
in
which
he
stated
that
he
had
sufficient
means
of
subsistence
and
that
*NL*
he
should
be
able
thenceforth
to
supply
all
his
needs
.
At
that
moment
,
*NL*
he
had
three
francs
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
aunt
did
not
inform
his
grandfather
of
this
refusal
for
fear
of
*NL*
exasperating
him
.
Besides
,
had
he
not
said
:
``
Let
me
never
hear
the
name
*NL*
of
that
blood-drinker
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
left
the
hotel
de
la
Porte
Saint-Jacques
,
as
he
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
run
in
debt
there

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Life
became
hard
for
Marius
.
It
was
nothing
to
eat
his
clothes
and
his
*NL*
watch
.
He
ate
of
that
terrible
,
inexpressible
thing
that
is
called
de
la
*NL*
vache
enrage
;
that
is
to
say
,
he
endured
great
hardships
and
privations
.
*NL*
A
terrible
thing
it
is
,
containing
days
without
bread
,
nights
without
*NL*
sleep
,
evenings
without
a
candle
,
a
hearth
without
a
fire
,
weeks
without
*NL*
work
,
a
future
without
hope
,
a
coat
out
at
the
elbows
,
an
old
hat
which
*NL*
evokes
the
laughter
of
young
girls
,
a
door
which
one
finds
locked
on
one
*NL*
at
night
because
one
's
rent
is
not
paid
,
the
insolence
of
the
porter
*NL*
and
the
cook-shop
man
,
the
sneers
of
neighbors
,
humiliations
,
dignity
*NL*
trampled
on
,
work
of
whatever
nature
accepted
,
disgusts
,
bitterness
,
*NL*
despondency
.
Marius
learned
how
all
this
is
eaten
,
and
how
such
are
*NL*
often
the
only
things
which
one
has
to
devour
.
At
that
moment
of
his
*NL*
existence
when
a
man
needs
his
pride
,
because
he
needs
love
,
he
felt
*NL*
that
he
was
jeered
at
because
he
was
badly
dressed
,
and
ridiculous
*NL*
because
he
was
poor
.
At
the
age
when
youth
swells
the
heart
with
*NL*
imperial
pride
,
he
dropped
his
eyes
more
than
once
on
his
dilapidated
*NL*
boots
,
and
he
knew
the
unjust
shame
and
the
poignant
blushes
of
*NL*
wretchedness
.
Admirable
and
terrible
trial
from
which
the
feeble
emerge
*NL*
base
,
from
which
the
strong
emerge
sublime
.
A
crucible
into
which
*NL*
destiny
casts
a
man
,
whenever
it
desires
a
scoundrel
or
a
demi-god
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
many
great
deeds
are
performed
in
petty
combats
.
There
are
instances
*NL*
of
bravery
ignored
and
obstinate
,
which
defend
themselves
step
by
*NL*
step
in
that
fatal
onslaught
of
necessities
and
turpitudes
.
Noble
and
*NL*
mysterious
triumphs
which
no
eye
beholds
,
which
are
requited
with
no
*NL*
renown
,
which
are
saluted
with
no
trumpet
blast
.
Life
,
misfortune
,
*NL*
isolation
,
abandonment
,
poverty
,
are
the
fields
of
battle
which
have
*NL*
their
heroes
;
obscure
heroes
,
who
are
,
sometimes
,
grander
than
the
*NL*
heroes
who
win
renown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Firm
and
rare
natures
are
thus
created
;
misery
,
almost
always
a
*NL*
step-mother
,
is
sometimes
a
mother
;
destitution
gives
birth
to
might
of
*NL*
soul
and
spirit
;
distress
is
the
nurse
of
pride
;
unhappiness
is
a
good
*NL*
milk
for
the
magnanimous
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
moment
in
Marius
'
life
,
when
he
swept
his
own
landing
,
when
*NL*
he
bought
his
sou
's
worth
of
Brie
cheese
at
the
fruiterer
's
,
when
he
*NL*
waited
until
twilight
had
fallen
to
slip
into
the
baker
's
and
purchase
*NL*
a
loaf
,
which
he
carried
off
furtively
to
his
attic
as
though
he
had
*NL*
stolen
it
.
Sometimes
there
could
be
seen
gliding
into
the
butcher
's
shop
*NL*
on
the
corner
,
in
the
midst
of
the
bantering
cooks
who
elbowed
him
,
an
*NL*
awkward
young
man
,
carrying
big
books
under
his
arm
,
who
had
a
timid
yet
*NL*
angry
air
,
who
,
on
entering
,
removed
his
hat
from
a
brow
whereon
stood
*NL*
drops
of
perspiration
,
made
a
profound
bow
to
the
butcher
's
astonished
*NL*
wife
,
asked
for
a
mutton
cutlet
,
paid
six
or
seven
sous
for
it
,
wrapped
*NL*
it
up
in
a
paper
,
put
it
under
his
arm
,
between
two
books
,
and
went
*NL*
away
.
It
was
Marius
.
On
this
cutlet
,
which
he
cooked
for
himself
,
he
*NL*
lived
for
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
first
day
he
ate
the
meat
,
on
the
second
he
ate
the
fat
,
on
the
*NL*
third
he
gnawed
the
bone
.
Aunt
Gillenormand
made
repeated
attempts
,
and
*NL*
sent
him
the
sixty
pistoles
several
times
.
Marius
returned
them
on
every
*NL*
occasion
,
saying
that
he
needed
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
still
in
mourning
for
his
father
when
the
revolution
which
we
*NL*
have
just
described
was
effected
within
him
.
From
that
time
forth
,
he
*NL*
had
not
put
off
his
black
garments
.
But
his
garments
were
quitting
him
.
*NL*
The
day
came
when
he
had
no
longer
a
coat
.
The
trousers
would
go
next
.
*NL*
What
was
to
be
done
?
Courfeyrac
,
to
whom
he
had
,
on
his
side
,
done
some
*NL*
good
turns
,
gave
him
an
old
coat
.
For
thirty
sous
,
Marius
got
it
turned
*NL*
by
some
porter
or
other
,
and
it
was
a
new
coat
.
But
this
coat
was
green
.
*NL*
Then
Marius
ceased
to
go
out
until
after
nightfall
.
This
made
his
coat
*NL*
black
.
As
he
wished
always
to
appear
in
mourning
,
he
clothed
himself
*NL*
with
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
this
,
he
got
admitted
to
practice
as
a
lawyer
.
He
was
*NL*
supposed
to
live
in
Courfeyrac
's
room
,
which
was
decent
,
and
where
*NL*
a
certain
number
of
law-books
backed
up
and
completed
by
several
*NL*
dilapidated
volumes
of
romance
,
passed
as
the
library
required
by
the
*NL*
regulations
.
He
had
his
letters
addressed
to
Courfeyrac
's
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marius
became
a
lawyer
,
he
informed
his
grandfather
of
the
fact
*NL*
in
a
letter
which
was
cold
but
full
of
submission
and
respect
.
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
trembled
as
he
took
the
letter
,
read
it
,
tore
it
in
four
*NL*
pieces
,
and
threw
it
into
the
waste-basket
.
Two
or
three
days
later
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
heard
her
father
,
who
was
alone
in
his
room
,
*NL*
talking
aloud
to
himself
.
He
always
did
this
whenever
he
was
greatly
*NL*
agitated
.
She
listened
,
and
the
old
man
was
saying
:
``
If
you
were
not
a
*NL*
fool
,
you
would
know
that
one
can
not
be
a
baron
and
a
lawyer
at
the
same
*NL*
time
.

CHAPTER

--
MARIUS
POOR
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
same
with
wretchedness
as
with
everything
else
.
It
ends
by
*NL*
becoming
bearable
.
It
finally
assumes
a
form
,
and
adjusts
itself
.
One
*NL*
vegetates
,
that
is
to
say
,
one
develops
in
a
certain
meagre
fashion
,
*NL*
which
is
,
however
,
sufficient
for
life
.
This
is
the
mode
in
which
the
*NL*
existence
of
Marius
Pontmercy
was
arranged
:
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
passed
the
worst
straits
;
the
narrow
pass
was
opening
out
a
*NL*
little
in
front
of
him
.
By
dint
of
toil
,
perseverance
,
courage
,
and
*NL*
will
,
he
had
managed
to
draw
from
his
work
about
seven
hundred
francs
a
*NL*
year
.
He
had
learned
German
and
English
;
thanks
to
Courfeyrac
,
who
had
*NL*
put
him
in
communication
with
his
friend
the
publisher
,
Marius
filled
*NL*
the
modest
post
of
utility
man
in
the
literature
of
the
publishing
*NL*
house
.
He
drew
up
prospectuses
,
translated
newspapers
,
annotated
*NL*
editions
,
compiled
biographies
,
etc.
;
net
product
,
year
in
and
year
*NL*
out
,
seven
hundred
francs
.
He
lived
on
it
.
How
?
Not
so
badly
.
We
will
*NL*
explain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
occupied
in
the
Gorbeau
house
,
for
an
annual
sum
of
thirty
*NL*
francs
,
a
den
minus
a
fireplace
,
called
a
cabinet
,
which
contained
only
*NL*
the
most
indispensable
articles
of
furniture
.
This
furniture
belonged
*NL*
to
him
.
He
gave
three
francs
a
month
to
the
old
principal
tenant
to
come
*NL*
and
sweep
his
hole
,
and
to
bring
him
a
little
hot
water
every
morning
,
*NL*
a
fresh
egg
,
and
a
penny
roll
.
He
breakfasted
on
this
egg
and
roll
.
His
*NL*
breakfast
varied
in
cost
from
two
to
four
sous
,
according
as
eggs
*NL*
were
dear
or
cheap
.
At
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
he
descended
the
*NL*
Rue
Saint-Jacques
to
dine
at
Rousseau
's
,
opposite
Basset
's
,
the
*NL*
stamp-dealer
's
,
on
the
corner
of
the
Rue
des
Mathurins
.
He
ate
no
soup
.
*NL*
He
took
a
six-sou
plate
of
meat
,
a
half-portion
of
vegetables
for
three
*NL*
sous
,
and
a
three-sou
dessert
.
For
three
sous
he
got
as
much
bread
as
*NL*
he
wished
.
As
for
wine
,
he
drank
water
.
When
he
paid
at
the
desk
*NL*
where
Madam
Rousseau
,
at
that
period
still
plump
and
rosy
majestically
*NL*
presided
,
he
gave
a
sou
to
the
waiter
,
and
Madam
Rousseau
gave
him
a
*NL*
smile
.
Then
he
went
away
.
For
sixteen
sous
he
had
a
smile
and
a
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Restaurant
Rousseau
,
where
so
few
bottles
and
so
many
water
carafes
*NL*
were
emptied
,
was
a
calming
potion
rather
than
a
restaurant
.
It
no
*NL*
longer
exists
.
The
proprietor
had
a
fine
nickname
:
he
was
called
*NL*
Rousseau
the
Aquatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
breakfast
four
sous
,
dinner
sixteen
sous
;
his
food
cost
him
twenty
*NL*
sous
a
day
;
which
made
three
hundred
and
sixty-five
francs
a
year
.
Add
*NL*
the
thirty
francs
for
rent
,
and
the
thirty-six
francs
to
the
old
woman
,
*NL*
plus
a
few
trifling
expenses
;
for
four
hundred
and
fifty
francs
,
Marius
*NL*
was
fed
,
lodged
,
and
waited
on
.
His
clothing
cost
him
a
hundred
francs
,
*NL*
his
linen
fifty
francs
,
his
washing
fifty
francs
;
the
whole
did
not
*NL*
exceed
six
hundred
and
fifty
francs
.
He
was
rich
.
He
sometimes
lent
ten
*NL*
francs
to
a
friend
.
Courfeyrac
had
once
been
able
to
borrow
sixty
francs
*NL*
of
him
.
As
far
as
fire
was
concerned
,
as
Marius
had
no
fireplace
,
he
had
*NL*
``
simplified
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
always
had
two
complete
suits
of
clothes
,
the
one
old
,
``
for
every
*NL*
day
''
;
the
other
,
brand
new
for
special
occasions
.
Both
were
black
.
He
*NL*
had
but
three
shirts
,
one
on
his
person
,
the
second
in
the
commode
,
and
*NL*
the
third
in
the
washerwoman
's
hands
.
He
renewed
them
as
they
wore
out
.
*NL*
They
were
always
ragged
,
which
caused
him
to
button
his
coat
to
the
*NL*
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
required
years
for
Marius
to
attain
to
this
flourishing
*NL*
condition
.
Hard
years
;
difficult
,
some
of
them
,
to
traverse
,
others
to
*NL*
climb
.
Marius
had
not
failed
for
a
single
day
.
He
had
endured
everything
*NL*
in
the
way
of
destitution
;
he
had
done
everything
except
contract
debts
.
*NL*
He
did
himself
the
justice
to
say
that
he
had
never
owed
any
one
a
sou
.
*NL*
A
debt
was
,
to
him
,
the
beginning
of
slavery
.
He
even
said
to
himself
,
*NL*
that
a
creditor
is
worse
than
a
master
;
for
the
master
possesses
only
*NL*
your
person
,
a
creditor
possesses
your
dignity
and
can
administer
to
*NL*
it
a
box
on
the
ear
.
Rather
than
borrow
,
he
went
without
food
.
He
had
*NL*
passed
many
a
day
fasting
.
Feeling
that
all
extremes
meet
,
and
that
,
*NL*
if
one
is
not
on
one
's
guard
,
lowered
fortunes
may
lead
to
baseness
of
*NL*
soul
,
he
kept
a
jealous
watch
on
his
pride
.
Such
and
such
a
formality
*NL*
or
action
,
which
,
in
any
other
situation
would
have
appeared
merely
a
*NL*
deference
to
him
,
now
seemed
insipidity
,
and
he
nerved
himself
against
*NL*
it
.
His
face
wore
a
sort
of
severe
flush
.
He
was
timid
even
to
rudeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
these
trials
he
had
felt
himself
encouraged
and
even
*NL*
uplifted
,
at
times
,
by
a
secret
force
that
he
possessed
within
himself
.
*NL*
The
soul
aids
the
body
,
and
at
certain
moments
,
raises
it
.
It
is
the
*NL*
only
bird
which
bears
up
its
own
cage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
his
father
's
name
,
another
name
was
graven
in
Marius
'
heart
,
*NL*
the
name
of
Thenardier
.
Marius
,
with
his
grave
and
enthusiastic
nature
,
*NL*
surrounded
with
a
sort
of
aureole
the
man
to
whom
,
in
his
thoughts
,
*NL*
he
owed
his
father
's
life
,
--
that
intrepid
sergeant
who
had
saved
the
*NL*
colonel
amid
the
bullets
and
the
cannon-balls
of
Waterloo
.
He
never
*NL*
separated
the
memory
of
this
man
from
the
memory
of
his
father
,
and
*NL*
he
associated
them
in
his
veneration
.
It
was
a
sort
of
worship
in
two
*NL*
steps
,
with
the
grand
altar
for
the
colonel
and
the
lesser
one
for
*NL*
Thenardier
.
What
redoubled
the
tenderness
of
his
gratitude
towards
*NL*
Thenardier
,
was
the
idea
of
the
distress
into
which
he
knew
that
*NL*
Thenardier
had
fallen
,
and
which
had
engulfed
the
latter
.
Marius
had
*NL*
learned
at
Montfermeil
of
the
ruin
and
bankruptcy
of
the
unfortunate
*NL*
inn-keeper
.
Since
that
time
,
he
had
made
unheard-of
efforts
to
find
*NL*
traces
of
him
and
to
reach
him
in
that
dark
abyss
of
misery
in
which
*NL*
Thenardier
had
disappeared
.
Marius
had
beaten
the
whole
country
;
he
*NL*
had
gone
to
Chelles
,
to
Bondy
,
to
Gourney
,
to
Nogent
,
to
Lagny
.
He
had
*NL*
persisted
for
three
years
,
expending
in
these
explorations
the
little
*NL*
money
which
he
had
laid
by
.
No
one
had
been
able
to
give
him
any
news
of
*NL*
Thenardier
:
he
was
supposed
to
have
gone
abroad
.
His
creditors
had
also
*NL*
sought
him
,
with
less
love
than
Marius
,
but
with
as
much
assiduity
,
and
*NL*
had
not
been
able
to
lay
their
hands
on
him
.
Marius
blamed
himself
,
and
*NL*
was
almost
angry
with
himself
for
his
lack
of
success
in
his
researches
.
*NL*
It
was
the
only
debt
left
him
by
the
colonel
,
and
Marius
made
it
a
*NL*
matter
of
honor
to
pay
it
.
``
What
,
''
he
thought
,
``
when
my
father
lay
dying
*NL*
on
the
field
of
battle
,
did
Thenardier
contrive
to
find
him
amid
the
*NL*
smoke
and
the
grape-shot
,
and
bear
him
off
on
his
shoulders
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
owed
him
nothing
,
and
I
,
who
owe
so
much
to
Thenardier
,
can
not
join
him
*NL*
in
this
shadow
where
he
is
lying
in
the
pangs
of
death
,
and
in
my
*NL*
turn
bring
him
back
from
death
to
life
!
Oh
!
I
will
find
him
!
''
To
find
*NL*
Thenardier
,
in
fact
,
Marius
would
have
given
one
of
his
arms
,
to
rescue
*NL*
him
from
his
misery
,
he
would
have
sacrificed
all
his
blood
.
To
see
*NL*
Thenardier
,
to
render
Thenardier
some
service
,
to
say
to
him
:
``
You
do
*NL*
not
know
me
;
well
,
I
do
know
you
!
Here
I
am
.
Dispose
of
me
!
''
This
was
*NL*
Marius
'
sweetest
and
most
magnificent
dream
.

CHAPTER
III
--
MARIUS
GROWN
UP
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
epoch
,
Marius
was
twenty
years
of
age
.
It
was
three
years
since
*NL*
he
had
left
his
grandfather
.
Both
parties
had
remained
on
the
same
*NL*
terms
,
without
attempting
to
approach
each
other
,
and
without
seeking
to
*NL*
see
each
other
.
Besides
,
what
was
the
use
of
seeing
each
other
?
Marius
*NL*
was
the
brass
vase
,
while
Father
Gillenormand
was
the
iron
pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
admit
that
Marius
was
mistaken
as
to
his
grandfather
's
heart
.
He
had
*NL*
imagined
that
M.
Gillenormand
had
never
loved
him
,
and
that
that
crusty
,
*NL*
harsh
,
and
smiling
old
fellow
who
cursed
,
shouted
,
and
stormed
*NL*
and
brandished
his
cane
,
cherished
for
him
,
at
the
most
,
only
that
*NL*
affection
,
which
is
at
once
slight
and
severe
,
of
the
dotards
of
comedy
.
*NL*
Marius
was
in
error
.
There
are
fathers
who
do
not
love
their
children
;
*NL*
there
exists
no
grandfather
who
does
not
adore
his
grandson
.
At
bottom
,
*NL*
as
we
have
said
,
M.
Gillenormand
idolized
Marius
.
He
idolized
him
after
*NL*
his
own
fashion
,
with
an
accompaniment
of
snappishness
and
boxes
on
the
*NL*
ear
;
but
,
this
child
once
gone
,
he
felt
a
black
void
in
his
heart
;
*NL*
he
would
allow
no
one
to
mention
the
child
to
him
,
and
all
the
while
*NL*
secretly
regretted
that
he
was
so
well
obeyed
.
At
first
,
he
hoped
that
*NL*
this
Buonapartist
,
this
Jacobin
,
this
terrorist
,
this
Septembrist
,
would
*NL*
return
.
But
the
weeks
passed
by
,
years
passed
;
to
M.
Gillenormand
's
*NL*
great
despair
,
the
``
blood-drinker
''
did
not
make
his
appearance
.
``
I
could
*NL*
not
do
otherwise
than
turn
him
out
,
''
said
the
grandfather
to
himself
,
*NL*
and
he
asked
himself
:
``
If
the
thing
were
to
do
over
again
,
would
I
do
*NL*
it
?
''
His
pride
instantly
answered
``
yes
,
''
but
his
aged
head
,
which
he
*NL*
shook
in
silence
,
replied
sadly
``
no
.
''
He
had
his
hours
of
depression
.
*NL*
He
missed
Marius
.
Old
men
need
affection
as
they
need
the
sun
.
It
is
*NL*
warmth
.
Strong
as
his
nature
was
,
the
absence
of
Marius
had
wrought
some
*NL*
change
in
him
.
Nothing
in
the
world
could
have
induced
him
to
take
a
*NL*
step
towards
``
that
rogue
''
;
but
he
suffered
.
He
never
inquired
about
him
,
*NL*
but
he
thought
of
him
incessantly
.
He
lived
in
the
Marais
in
a
more
and
*NL*
more
retired
manner
;
he
was
still
merry
and
violent
as
of
old
,
but
*NL*
his
merriment
had
a
convulsive
harshness
,
and
his
violences
always
*NL*
terminated
in
a
sort
of
gentle
and
gloomy
dejection
.
He
sometimes
said
:
*NL*
``
Oh
!
if
he
only
would
return
,
what
a
good
box
on
the
ear
I
would
give
*NL*
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
his
aunt
,
she
thought
too
little
to
love
much
;
Marius
was
no
*NL*
longer
for
her
much
more
than
a
vague
black
form
;
and
she
eventually
*NL*
came
to
occupy
herself
with
him
much
less
than
with
the
cat
or
the
*NL*
paroquet
which
she
probably
had
.
What
augmented
Father
Gillenormand
's
*NL*
secret
suffering
was
,
that
he
locked
it
all
up
within
his
breast
,
and
*NL*
did
not
allow
its
existence
to
be
divined
.
His
sorrow
was
like
those
*NL*
recently
invented
furnaces
which
consume
their
own
smoke
.
It
sometimes
*NL*
happened
that
officious
busybodies
spoke
to
him
of
Marius
,
and
asked
*NL*
him
:
``
What
is
your
grandson
doing
?
''
``
What
has
become
of
him
?
''
The
old
*NL*
bourgeois
replied
with
a
sigh
,
that
he
was
a
sad
case
,
and
giving
a
*NL*
fillip
to
his
cuff
,
if
he
wished
to
appear
gay
:
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
de
*NL*
Pontmercy
is
practising
pettifogging
in
some
corner
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
old
man
regretted
,
Marius
applauded
himself
.
As
is
the
case
*NL*
with
all
good-hearted
people
,
misfortune
had
eradicated
his
bitterness
.
*NL*
He
only
thought
of
M.
Gillenormand
in
an
amiable
light
,
but
he
had
set
*NL*
his
mind
on
not
receiving
anything
more
from
the
man
who
had
been
*NL*
unkind
to
his
father
.
This
was
the
mitigated
translation
of
his
first
*NL*
indignation
.
Moreover
,
he
was
happy
at
having
suffered
,
and
at
suffering
*NL*
still
.
It
was
for
his
father
's
sake
.
The
hardness
of
his
life
satisfied
*NL*
and
pleased
him
.
He
said
to
himself
with
a
sort
of
joy
that
--
it
was
*NL*
certainly
the
least
he
could
do
;
that
it
was
an
expiation
;
--
that
,
had
*NL*
it
not
been
for
that
,
he
would
have
been
punished
in
some
other
way
and
*NL*
later
on
for
his
impious
indifference
towards
his
father
,
and
such
a
*NL*
father
!
that
it
would
not
have
been
just
that
his
father
should
have
all
*NL*
the
suffering
,
and
he
none
of
it
;
and
that
,
in
any
case
,
what
were
his
*NL*
toils
and
his
destitution
compared
with
the
colonel
's
heroic
life
?
that
,
*NL*
in
short
,
the
only
way
for
him
to
approach
his
father
and
resemble
him
,
*NL*
was
to
be
brave
in
the
face
of
indigence
,
as
the
other
had
been
valiant
*NL*
before
the
enemy
;
and
that
that
was
,
no
doubt
,
what
the
colonel
had
*NL*
meant
to
imply
by
the
words
:
``
He
will
be
worthy
of
it
.
''
Words
which
*NL*
Marius
continued
to
wear
,
not
on
his
breast
,
since
the
colonel
's
writing
*NL*
had
disappeared
,
but
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
on
the
day
when
his
grandfather
had
turned
him
out
of
doors
,
*NL*
he
had
been
only
a
child
,
now
he
was
a
man
.
He
felt
it
.
Misery
,
we
*NL*
repeat
,
had
been
good
for
him
.
Poverty
in
youth
,
when
it
succeeds
,
has
*NL*
this
magnificent
property
about
it
,
that
it
turns
the
whole
will
towards
*NL*
effort
,
and
the
whole
soul
towards
aspiration
.
Poverty
instantly
lays
*NL*
material
life
bare
and
renders
it
hideous
;
hence
inexpressible
bounds
*NL*
towards
the
ideal
life
.
The
wealthy
young
man
has
a
hundred
coarse
and
*NL*
brilliant
distractions
,
horse
races
,
hunting
,
dogs
,
tobacco
,
gaming
,
*NL*
good
repasts
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
;
occupations
for
the
baser
side
*NL*
of
the
soul
,
at
the
expense
of
the
loftier
and
more
delicate
sides
.
*NL*
The
poor
young
man
wins
his
bread
with
difficulty
;
he
eats
;
when
he
has
*NL*
eaten
,
he
has
nothing
more
but
meditation
.
He
goes
to
the
spectacles
*NL*
which
God
furnishes
gratis
;
he
gazes
at
the
sky
,
space
,
the
stars
,
*NL*
flowers
,
children
,
the
humanity
among
which
he
is
suffering
,
the
*NL*
creation
amid
which
he
beams
.
He
gazes
so
much
on
humanity
that
he
*NL*
perceives
its
soul
,
he
gazes
upon
creation
to
such
an
extent
that
he
*NL*
beholds
God
.
He
dreams
,
he
feels
himself
great
;
he
dreams
on
,
and
feels
*NL*
himself
tender
.
From
the
egotism
of
the
man
who
suffers
he
passes
to
the
*NL*
compassion
of
the
man
who
meditates
.
An
admirable
sentiment
breaks
forth
*NL*
in
him
,
forgetfulness
of
self
and
pity
for
all
.
As
he
thinks
of
the
*NL*
innumerable
enjoyments
which
nature
offers
,
gives
,
and
lavishes
to
souls
*NL*
which
stand
open
,
and
refuses
to
souls
that
are
closed
,
he
comes
to
*NL*
pity
,
he
the
millionnaire
of
the
mind
,
the
millionnaire
of
money
.
All
*NL*
hatred
departs
from
his
heart
,
in
proportion
as
light
penetrates
his
*NL*
spirit
.
And
is
he
unhappy
?
No
.
The
misery
of
a
young
man
is
never
*NL*
miserable
.
The
first
young
lad
who
comes
to
hand
,
however
poor
he
may
*NL*
be
,
with
his
strength
,
his
health
,
his
rapid
walk
,
his
brilliant
eyes
,
*NL*
his
warmly
circulating
blood
,
his
black
hair
,
his
red
lips
,
his
white
*NL*
teeth
,
his
pure
breath
,
will
always
arouse
the
envy
of
an
aged
emperor
.
*NL*
And
then
,
every
morning
,
he
sets
himself
afresh
to
the
task
of
earning
*NL*
his
bread
;
and
while
his
hands
earn
his
bread
,
his
dorsal
column
*NL*
gains
pride
,
his
brain
gathers
ideas
.
His
task
finished
,
he
returns
to
*NL*
ineffable
ecstasies
,
to
contemplation
,
to
joys
;
he
beholds
his
feet
set
*NL*
in
afflictions
,
in
obstacles
,
on
the
pavement
,
in
the
nettles
,
sometimes
*NL*
in
the
mire
;
his
head
in
the
light
.
He
is
firm
,
serene
,
gentle
,
peaceful
,
*NL*
attentive
,
serious
,
content
with
little
,
kindly
;
and
he
thanks
God
for
*NL*
having
bestowed
on
him
those
two
forms
of
riches
which
many
a
rich
*NL*
man
lacks
:
work
,
which
makes
him
free
;
and
thought
,
which
makes
him
*NL*
dignified
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
had
happened
with
Marius
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
he
inclined
a
*NL*
little
too
much
to
the
side
of
contemplation
.
From
the
day
when
he
had
*NL*
succeeded
in
earning
his
living
with
some
approach
to
certainty
,
he
had
*NL*
stopped
,
thinking
it
good
to
be
poor
,
and
retrenching
time
from
his
work
*NL*
to
give
to
thought
;
that
is
to
say
,
he
sometimes
passed
entire
days
*NL*
in
meditation
,
absorbed
,
engulfed
,
like
a
visionary
,
in
the
mute
*NL*
voluptuousness
of
ecstasy
and
inward
radiance
.
He
had
thus
propounded
*NL*
the
problem
of
his
life
:
to
toil
as
little
as
possible
at
material
*NL*
labor
,
in
order
to
toil
as
much
as
possible
at
the
labor
which
is
*NL*
impalpable
;
in
other
words
,
to
bestow
a
few
hours
on
real
life
,
and
to
*NL*
cast
the
rest
to
the
infinite
.
As
he
believed
that
he
lacked
nothing
,
he
*NL*
did
not
perceive
that
contemplation
,
thus
understood
,
ends
by
becoming
*NL*
one
of
the
forms
of
idleness
;
that
he
was
contenting
himself
with
*NL*
conquering
the
first
necessities
of
life
,
and
that
he
was
resting
from
*NL*
his
labors
too
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
,
for
this
energetic
and
enthusiastic
nature
,
this
*NL*
could
only
be
a
transitory
state
,
and
that
,
at
the
first
shock
against
*NL*
the
inevitable
complications
of
destiny
,
Marius
would
awaken
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
although
he
was
a
lawyer
,
and
whatever
Father
*NL*
Gillenormand
thought
about
the
matter
,
he
was
not
practising
,
he
was
*NL*
not
even
pettifogging
.
Meditation
had
turned
him
aside
from
pleading
.
To
*NL*
haunt
attorneys
,
to
follow
the
court
,
to
hunt
up
cases
--
what
a
bore
!
Why
*NL*
should
he
do
it
?
He
saw
no
reason
for
changing
the
manner
of
gaining
his
*NL*
livelihood
!
The
obscure
and
ill-paid
publishing
establishment
had
come
*NL*
to
mean
for
him
a
sure
source
of
work
which
did
not
involve
too
much
*NL*
labor
,
as
we
have
explained
,
and
which
sufficed
for
his
wants
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
publishers
for
whom
he
worked
,
M.
Magimel
,
I
think
,
offered
*NL*
to
take
him
into
his
own
house
,
to
lodge
him
well
,
to
furnish
him
with
*NL*
regular
occupation
,
and
to
give
him
fifteen
hundred
francs
a
year
.
To
be
*NL*
well
lodged
!
Fifteen
hundred
francs
!
No
doubt
.
But
renounce
his
liberty
!
*NL*
Be
on
fixed
wages
!
A
sort
of
hired
man
of
letters
!
According
to
Marius
'
*NL*
opinion
,
if
he
accepted
,
his
position
would
become
both
better
and
worse
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
he
acquired
comfort
,
and
lost
his
dignity
;
it
was
a
*NL*
fine
and
complete
unhappiness
converted
into
a
repulsive
and
ridiculous
*NL*
state
of
torture
:
something
like
the
case
of
a
blind
man
who
should
*NL*
recover
the
sight
of
one
eye
.
He
refused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
dwelt
in
solitude
.
Owing
to
his
taste
for
remaining
outside
of
*NL*
everything
,
and
through
having
been
too
much
alarmed
,
he
had
not
entered
*NL*
decidedly
into
the
group
presided
over
by
Enjolras
.
They
had
remained
*NL*
good
friends
;
they
were
ready
to
assist
each
other
on
occasion
in
every
*NL*
possible
way
;
but
nothing
more
.
Marius
had
two
friends
:
one
young
,
*NL*
Courfeyrac
;
and
one
old
,
M.
Mabeuf
.
He
inclined
more
to
the
old
man
.
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
he
owed
to
him
the
revolution
which
had
taken
*NL*
place
within
him
;
to
him
he
was
indebted
for
having
known
and
loved
his
*NL*
father
.
``
He
operated
on
me
for
a
cataract
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
churchwarden
had
certainly
played
a
decisive
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
,
however
,
that
M.
Mabeuf
had
been
anything
but
the
calm
and
*NL*
impassive
agent
of
Providence
in
this
connection
.
He
had
enlightened
*NL*
Marius
by
chance
and
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
,
as
does
a
candle
*NL*
which
some
one
brings
;
he
had
been
the
candle
and
not
the
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Marius
'
inward
political
revolution
,
M.
Mabeuf
was
totally
*NL*
incapable
of
comprehending
it
,
of
willing
or
of
directing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
shall
see
M.
Mabeuf
again
,
later
on
,
a
few
words
will
not
be
*NL*
superfluous
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
M.
MABEUF
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
M.
Mabeuf
said
to
Marius
:
``
Certainly
I
approve
of
*NL*
political
opinions
,
''
he
expressed
the
real
state
of
his
mind
.
All
*NL*
political
opinions
were
matters
of
indifference
to
him
,
and
he
approved
*NL*
them
all
,
without
distinction
,
provided
they
left
him
in
peace
,
as
the
*NL*
Greeks
called
the
Furies
``
the
beautiful
,
the
good
,
the
charming
,
''
the
*NL*
Eumenides
.
M.
Mabeuf
's
political
opinion
consisted
in
a
passionate
love
*NL*
for
plants
,
and
,
above
all
,
for
books
.
Like
all
the
rest
of
the
world
,
*NL*
he
possessed
the
termination
in
ist
,
without
which
no
one
could
exist
at
*NL*
that
time
,
but
he
was
neither
a
Royalist
,
a
Bonapartist
,
a
Chartist
,
*NL*
an
Orleanist
,
nor
an
Anarchist
;
he
was
a
bouquinist
,
a
collector
of
old
*NL*
books
.
He
did
not
understand
how
men
could
busy
themselves
with
*NL*
hating
each
other
because
of
silly
stuff
like
the
charter
,
democracy
,
*NL*
legitimacy
,
monarchy
,
the
republic
,
etc.
,
when
there
were
in
the
world
*NL*
all
sorts
of
mosses
,
grasses
,
and
shrubs
which
they
might
be
looking
at
,
*NL*
and
heaps
of
folios
,
and
even
of
32mos
,
which
they
might
turn
over
.
He
*NL*
took
good
care
not
to
become
useless
;
having
books
did
not
prevent
his
*NL*
reading
,
being
a
botanist
did
not
prevent
his
being
a
gardener
.
When
*NL*
he
made
Pontmercy
's
acquaintance
,
this
sympathy
had
existed
between
the
*NL*
colonel
and
himself
--
that
what
the
colonel
did
for
flowers
,
he
did
for
*NL*
fruits
.
M.
Mabeuf
had
succeeded
in
producing
seedling
pears
as
savory
*NL*
as
the
pears
of
St.
Germain
;
it
is
from
one
of
his
combinations
,
*NL*
apparently
,
that
the
October
Mirabelle
,
now
celebrated
and
no
less
*NL*
perfumed
than
the
summer
Mirabelle
,
owes
its
origin
.
He
went
to
mass
*NL*
rather
from
gentleness
than
from
piety
,
and
because
,
as
he
loved
the
*NL*
faces
of
men
,
but
hated
their
noise
,
he
found
them
assembled
and
silent
*NL*
only
in
church
.
Feeling
that
he
must
be
something
in
the
State
,
he
had
*NL*
chosen
the
career
of
warden
.
However
,
he
had
never
succeeded
in
loving
*NL*
any
woman
as
much
as
a
tulip
bulb
,
nor
any
man
as
much
as
an
Elzevir
.
*NL*
He
had
long
passed
sixty
,
when
,
one
day
,
some
one
asked
him
:
``
Have
you
*NL*
never
been
married
?
''
``
I
have
forgotten
,
''
said
he
.
When
it
sometimes
*NL*
happened
to
him
--
and
to
whom
does
it
not
happen
?
--
to
say
:
``
Oh
!
if
I
were
*NL*
only
rich
!
''
it
was
not
when
ogling
a
pretty
girl
,
as
was
the
case
with
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
,
but
when
contemplating
an
old
book
.
He
lived
alone
*NL*
with
an
old
housekeeper
.
He
was
somewhat
gouty
,
and
when
he
was
asleep
,
*NL*
his
aged
fingers
,
stiffened
with
rheumatism
,
lay
crooked
up
in
the
folds
*NL*
of
his
sheets
.
He
had
composed
and
published
a
Flora
of
the
Environs
of
*NL*
Cauteretz
,
with
colored
plates
,
a
work
which
enjoyed
a
tolerable
*NL*
measure
of
esteem
and
which
sold
well
.
People
rang
his
bell
,
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Mesieres
,
two
or
three
times
a
day
,
to
ask
for
it
.
He
drew
as
much
as
*NL*
two
thousand
francs
a
year
from
it
;
this
constituted
nearly
the
whole
of
*NL*
his
fortune
.
Although
poor
,
he
had
had
the
talent
to
form
for
himself
,
*NL*
by
dint
of
patience
,
privations
,
and
time
,
a
precious
collection
of
rare
*NL*
copies
of
every
sort
.
He
never
went
out
without
a
book
under
his
arm
,
*NL*
and
he
often
returned
with
two
.
The
sole
decoration
of
the
four
rooms
*NL*
on
the
ground
floor
,
which
composed
his
lodgings
,
consisted
of
framed
*NL*
herbariums
,
and
engravings
of
the
old
masters
.
The
sight
of
a
sword
or
*NL*
a
gun
chilled
his
blood
.
He
had
never
approached
a
cannon
in
his
life
,
*NL*
even
at
the
Invalides
.
He
had
a
passable
stomach
,
a
brother
who
was
a
*NL*
cure
,
perfectly
white
hair
,
no
teeth
,
either
in
his
mouth
or
his
mind
,
a
*NL*
trembling
in
every
limb
,
a
Picard
accent
,
an
infantile
laugh
,
the
air
of
*NL*
an
old
sheep
,
and
he
was
easily
frightened
.
Add
to
this
,
that
he
had
no
*NL*
other
friendship
,
no
other
acquaintance
among
the
living
,
than
an
old
*NL*
bookseller
of
the
Porte-Saint-Jacques
,
named
Royal
.
His
dream
was
to
*NL*
naturalize
indigo
in
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
servant
was
also
a
sort
of
innocent
.
The
poor
good
old
woman
was
a
*NL*
spinster
.
Sultan
,
her
cat
,
which
might
have
mewed
Allegri
's
miserere
in
*NL*
the
Sixtine
Chapel
,
had
filled
her
heart
and
sufficed
for
the
quantity
*NL*
of
passion
which
existed
in
her
.
None
of
her
dreams
had
ever
proceeded
*NL*
as
far
as
man
.
She
had
never
been
able
to
get
further
than
her
cat
.
Like
*NL*
him
,
she
had
a
mustache
.
Her
glory
consisted
in
her
caps
,
which
were
*NL*
always
white
.
She
passed
her
time
,
on
Sundays
,
after
mass
,
in
counting
*NL*
over
the
linen
in
her
chest
,
and
in
spreading
out
on
her
bed
the
dresses
*NL*
in
the
piece
which
she
bought
and
never
had
made
up
.
She
knew
how
to
*NL*
read
.
M.
Mabeuf
had
nicknamed
her
Mother
Plutarque
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
had
taken
a
fancy
to
Marius
,
because
Marius
,
being
young
and
*NL*
gentle
,
warmed
his
age
without
startling
his
timidity
.
Youth
combined
*NL*
with
gentleness
produces
on
old
people
the
effect
of
the
sun
without
*NL*
wind
.
When
Marius
was
saturated
with
military
glory
,
with
gunpowder
,
*NL*
with
marches
and
countermarches
,
and
with
all
those
prodigious
battles
*NL*
in
which
his
father
had
given
and
received
such
tremendous
blows
of
the
*NL*
sword
,
he
went
to
see
M.
Mabeuf
,
and
M.
Mabeuf
talked
to
him
of
his
hero
*NL*
from
the
point
of
view
of
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
brother
the
cure
died
about
1830
,
and
almost
immediately
,
as
when
*NL*
the
night
is
drawing
on
,
the
whole
horizon
grew
dark
for
M.
Mabeuf
.
A
*NL*
notary
's
failure
deprived
him
of
the
sum
of
ten
thousand
francs
,
which
*NL*
was
all
that
he
possessed
in
his
brother
's
right
and
his
own
.
The
*NL*
Revolution
of
July
brought
a
crisis
to
publishing
.
In
a
period
of
*NL*
embarrassment
,
the
first
thing
which
does
not
sell
is
a
Flora
.
The
Flora
*NL*
of
the
Environs
of
Cauteretz
stopped
short
.
Weeks
passed
by
without
a
*NL*
single
purchaser
.
Sometimes
M.
Mabeuf
started
at
the
sound
of
the
bell
.
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
said
Mother
Plutarque
sadly
,
``
it
is
the
water-carrier
.
''
*NL*
In
short
,
one
day
,
M.
Mabeuf
quitted
the
Rue
Mesieres
,
abdicated
the
*NL*
functions
of
warden
,
gave
up
Saint-Sulpice
,
sold
not
a
part
of
his
*NL*
books
,
but
of
his
prints
,
--
that
to
which
he
was
the
least
attached
,
--
and
*NL*
installed
himself
in
a
little
house
on
the
Rue
Montparnasse
,
where
,
*NL*
however
,
he
remained
but
one
quarter
for
two
reasons
:
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
the
ground
floor
and
the
garden
cost
three
hundred
francs
,
and
he
*NL*
dared
not
spend
more
than
two
hundred
francs
on
his
rent
;
in
the
second
,
*NL*
being
near
Faton
's
shooting-gallery
,
he
could
hear
the
pistol-shots
;
*NL*
which
was
intolerable
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
carried
off
his
Flora
,
his
copper-plates
,
his
herbariums
,
his
*NL*
portfolios
,
and
his
books
,
and
established
himself
near
the
Salpetriere
,
*NL*
in
a
sort
of
thatched
cottage
of
the
village
of
Austerlitz
,
where
,
*NL*
for
fifty
crowns
a
year
,
he
got
three
rooms
and
a
garden
enclosed
by
a
*NL*
hedge
,
and
containing
a
well
.
He
took
advantage
of
this
removal
to
sell
*NL*
off
nearly
all
his
furniture
.
On
the
day
of
his
entrance
into
his
new
*NL*
quarters
,
he
was
very
gay
,
and
drove
the
nails
on
which
his
engravings
*NL*
and
herbariums
were
to
hang
,
with
his
own
hands
,
dug
in
his
garden
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
day
,
and
at
night
,
perceiving
that
Mother
Plutarque
had
a
*NL*
melancholy
air
,
and
was
very
thoughtful
,
he
tapped
her
on
the
shoulder
*NL*
and
said
to
her
with
a
smile
:
``
We
have
the
indigo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
two
visitors
,
the
bookseller
of
the
Porte-Saint-Jacques
and
Marius
,
*NL*
were
admitted
to
view
the
thatched
cottage
at
Austerlitz
,
a
brawling
*NL*
name
which
was
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
extremely
disagreeable
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
we
have
just
pointed
out
,
brains
which
are
absorbed
in
some
*NL*
bit
of
wisdom
,
or
folly
,
or
,
as
it
often
happens
,
in
both
at
once
,
are
*NL*
but
slowly
accessible
to
the
things
of
actual
life
.
Their
own
destiny
*NL*
is
a
far-off
thing
to
them
.
There
results
from
such
concentration
a
*NL*
passivity
,
which
,
if
it
were
the
outcome
of
reasoning
,
would
resemble
*NL*
philosophy
.
One
declines
,
descends
,
trickles
away
,
even
crumbles
away
,
*NL*
and
yet
is
hardly
conscious
of
it
one
's
self
.
It
always
ends
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
in
an
awakening
,
but
the
awakening
is
tardy
.
In
the
meantime
,
it
*NL*
seems
as
though
we
held
ourselves
neutral
in
the
game
which
is
going
on
*NL*
between
our
happiness
and
our
unhappiness
.
We
are
the
stake
,
and
we
look
*NL*
on
at
the
game
with
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
thus
that
,
athwart
the
cloud
which
formed
about
him
,
when
all
his
*NL*
hopes
were
extinguished
one
after
the
other
,
M.
Mabeuf
remained
rather
*NL*
puerilely
,
but
profoundly
serene
.
His
habits
of
mind
had
the
regular
*NL*
swing
of
a
pendulum
.
Once
mounted
on
an
illusion
,
he
went
for
a
very
*NL*
long
time
,
even
after
the
illusion
had
disappeared
.
A
clock
does
not
*NL*
stop
short
at
the
precise
moment
when
the
key
is
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
had
his
innocent
pleasures
.
These
pleasures
were
inexpensive
*NL*
and
unexpected
;
the
merest
chance
furnished
them
.
One
day
,
Mother
*NL*
Plutarque
was
reading
a
romance
in
one
corner
of
the
room
.
She
was
*NL*
reading
aloud
,
finding
that
she
understood
better
thus
.
To
read
aloud
is
*NL*
to
assure
one
's
self
of
what
one
is
reading
.
There
are
people
who
read
*NL*
very
loud
,
and
who
have
the
appearance
of
giving
themselves
their
word
*NL*
of
honor
as
to
what
they
are
perusing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
this
sort
of
energy
that
Mother
Plutarque
was
reading
the
*NL*
romance
which
she
had
in
hand
.
M.
Mabeuf
heard
her
without
listening
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
her
reading
,
Mother
Plutarque
came
to
this
phrase
.
It
*NL*
was
a
question
of
an
officer
of
dragoons
and
a
beauty
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
The
beauty
pouted
,
and
the
dragoon
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
interrupted
herself
to
wipe
her
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bouddha
and
the
Dragon

''
struck
in
M.
Mabeuf
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Yes
,
it
*NL*
is
true
that
there
was
a
dragon
,
which
,
from
the
depths
of
its
cave
,
*NL*
spouted
flame
through
his
maw
and
set
the
heavens
on
fire
.
Many
stars
*NL*
had
already
been
consumed
by
this
monster
,
which
,
besides
,
had
the
claws
*NL*
of
a
tiger
.
Bouddha
went
into
its
den
and
succeeded
in
converting
the
*NL*
dragon

That
is
a
good
book

*NL*
There
is
no
more
beautiful

fell
into
a
delicious
revery

CHAPTER
V
--
POVERTY
A
GOOD
NEIGHBOR
FOR
MISERY
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
liked
this
candid
old
man
who
saw
himself
gradually
falling
into
*NL*
the
clutches
of
indigence
,
and
who
came
to
feel
astonishment
,
little
*NL*
by
little
,
without
,
however
,
being
made
melancholy
by
it
.
Marius
met
*NL*
Courfeyrac
and
sought
out
M.
Mabeuf
.
Very
rarely
,
however
;
twice
a
month
*NL*
at
most
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
pleasure
consisted
in
taking
long
walks
alone
on
the
outer
*NL*
boulevards
,
or
in
the
Champs-de-Mars
,
or
in
the
least
frequented
alleys
*NL*
of
the
Luxembourg
.
He
often
spent
half
a
day
in
gazing
at
a
market
*NL*
garden
,
the
beds
of
lettuce
,
the
chickens
on
the
dung-heap
,
the
horse
*NL*
turning
the
water-wheel
.
The
passers-by
stared
at
him
in
surprise
,
and
*NL*
some
of
them
thought
his
attire
suspicious
and
his
mien
sinister
.
He
was
*NL*
only
a
poor
young
man
dreaming
in
an
objectless
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
during
one
of
his
strolls
that
he
had
hit
upon
the
Gorbeau
house
,
*NL*
and
,
tempted
by
its
isolation
and
its
cheapness
,
had
taken
up
his
abode
*NL*
there
.
He
was
known
there
only
under
the
name
of
M.
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
his
father
's
old
generals
or
old
comrades
had
invited
him
to
go
*NL*
and
see
them
,
when
they
learned
about
him
.
Marius
had
not
refused
their
*NL*
invitations
.
They
afforded
opportunities
of
talking
about
his
father
.
*NL*
Thus
he
went
from
time
to
time
,
to
Comte
Pajol
,
to
General
Bellavesne
,
*NL*
to
General
Fririon
,
to
the
Invalides
.
There
was
music
and
dancing
there
.
*NL*
On
such
evenings
,
Marius
put
on
his
new
coat
.
But
he
never
went
to
*NL*
these
evening
parties
or
balls
except
on
days
when
it
was
freezing
cold
,
*NL*
because
he
could
not
afford
a
carriage
,
and
he
did
not
wish
to
arrive
*NL*
with
boots
otherwise
than
like
mirrors
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
sometimes
,
but
without
bitterness
:
``
Men
are
so
made
that
in
a
*NL*
drawing-room
you
may
be
soiled
everywhere
except
on
your
shoes
.
In
order
*NL*
to
insure
a
good
reception
there
,
only
one
irreproachable
thing
is
asked
*NL*
of
you
;
your
conscience
?
No
,
your
boots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
passions
except
those
of
the
heart
are
dissipated
by
revery
.
Marius
'
*NL*
political
fevers
vanished
thus
.
The
Revolution
of
1830
assisted
in
the
*NL*
process
,
by
satisfying
and
calming
him
.
He
remained
the
same
,
setting
*NL*
aside
his
fits
of
wrath
.
He
still
held
the
same
opinions
.
Only
,
they
had
*NL*
been
tempered
.
To
speak
accurately
,
he
had
no
longer
any
opinions
,
he
*NL*
had
sympathies
.
To
what
party
did
he
belong
?
To
the
party
of
humanity
.
*NL*
Out
of
humanity
he
chose
France
;
out
of
the
Nation
he
chose
the
people
;
*NL*
out
of
the
people
he
chose
the
woman
.
It
was
to
that
point
above
all
,
*NL*
that
his
pity
was
directed
.
Now
he
preferred
an
idea
to
a
deed
,
a
*NL*
poet
to
a
hero
,
and
he
admired
a
book
like
Job
more
than
an
event
like
*NL*
Marengo
.
And
then
,
when
,
after
a
day
spent
in
meditation
,
he
returned
*NL*
in
the
evening
through
the
boulevards
,
and
caught
a
glimpse
through
*NL*
the
branches
of
the
trees
of
the
fathomless
space
beyond
,
the
nameless
*NL*
gleams
,
the
abyss
,
the
shadow
,
the
mystery
,
all
that
which
is
only
human
*NL*
seemed
very
petty
indeed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
that
he
had
,
and
he
really
had
,
in
fact
,
arrived
at
the
truth
*NL*
of
life
and
of
human
philosophy
,
and
he
had
ended
by
gazing
at
nothing
*NL*
but
heaven
,
the
only
thing
which
Truth
can
perceive
from
the
bottom
of
*NL*
her
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
did
not
prevent
him
from
multiplying
his
plans
,
his
combinations
,
*NL*
his
scaffoldings
,
his
projects
for
the
future
.
In
this
state
of
revery
,
*NL*
an
eye
which
could
have
cast
a
glance
into
Marius
'
interior
would
have
*NL*
been
dazzled
with
the
purity
of
that
soul
.
In
fact
,
had
it
been
given
to
*NL*
our
eyes
of
the
flesh
to
gaze
into
the
consciences
of
others
,
we
should
*NL*
be
able
to
judge
a
man
much
more
surely
according
to
what
he
dreams
,
*NL*
than
according
to
what
he
thinks
.
There
is
will
in
thought
,
there
is
*NL*
none
in
dreams
.
Revery
,
which
is
utterly
spontaneous
,
takes
and
keeps
,
*NL*
even
in
the
gigantic
and
the
ideal
,
the
form
of
our
spirit
.
Nothing
*NL*
proceeds
more
directly
and
more
sincerely
from
the
very
depth
of
our
*NL*
soul
,
than
our
unpremeditated
and
boundless
aspirations
towards
*NL*
the
splendors
of
destiny
.
In
these
aspirations
,
much
more
than
in
*NL*
deliberate
,
rational
coordinated
ideas
,
is
the
real
character
of
a
man
*NL*
to
be
found
.
Our
chimeras
are
the
things
which
the
most
resemble
us
.
*NL*
Each
one
of
us
dreams
of
the
unknown
and
the
impossible
in
accordance
*NL*
with
his
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
middle
of
this
year
1831
,
the
old
woman
who
waited
on
Marius
*NL*
told
him
that
his
neighbors
,
the
wretched
Jondrette
family
,
had
been
*NL*
turned
out
of
doors
.
Marius
,
who
passed
nearly
the
whole
of
his
days
out
*NL*
of
the
house
,
hardly
knew
that
he
had
any
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
they
turned
out
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
do
not
pay
their
rent
;
they
owe
for
two
quarters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
francs
,
''
said
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
thirty
francs
saved
up
in
a
drawer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
he
said
to
the
old
woman
,
``
take
these
twenty-five
francs
.
Pay
*NL*
for
the
poor
people
and
give
them
five
francs
,
and
do
not
tell
them
that
*NL*
it
was
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
SUBSTITUTE
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
the
regiment
to
which
Lieutenant
Theodule
belonged
came
*NL*
to
perform
garrison
duty
in
Paris
.
This
inspired
Aunt
Gillenormand
with
*NL*
a
second
idea
.
She
had
,
on
the
first
occasion
,
hit
upon
the
plan
of
*NL*
having
Marius
spied
upon
by
Theodule
;
now
she
plotted
to
have
Theodule
*NL*
take
Marius
'
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
and
in
case
the
grandfather
should
feel
the
vague
need
of
*NL*
a
young
face
in
the
house
,
--
these
rays
of
dawn
are
sometimes
sweet
to
*NL*
ruin
,
--
it
was
expedient
to
find
another
Marius
.
``
Take
it
as
a
simple
*NL*
erratum
,
''
she
thought
,
``
such
as
one
sees
in
books
.
For
Marius
,
read
*NL*
Theodule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
grandnephew
is
almost
the
same
as
a
grandson
;
in
default
of
a
lawyer
*NL*
one
takes
a
lancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
when
M.
Gillenormand
was
about
to
read
something
in
the
*NL*
Quotidienne
,
his
daughter
entered
and
said
to
him
in
her
sweetest
voice
;
*NL*
for
the
question
concerned
her
favorite
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
Theodule
is
coming
to
present
his
respects
to
you
this
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
Theodule
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
grandnephew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
the
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
back
to
his
reading
,
thought
no
more
of
his
grandnephew
,
*NL*
who
was
merely
some
Theodule
or
other
,
and
soon
flew
into
a
rage
,
which
*NL*
almost
always
happened
when
he
read
.
The
``
sheet
''
which
he
held
,
although
*NL*
Royalist
,
of
course
,
announced
for
the
following
day
,
without
any
*NL*
softening
phrases
,
one
of
these
little
events
which
were
of
daily
*NL*
occurrence
at
that
date
in
Paris
:
``
That
the
students
of
the
schools
*NL*
of
law
and
medicine
were
to
assemble
on
the
Place
du
Pantheon
,
at
*NL*
midday
,
--
to
deliberate
.
''
The
discussion
concerned
one
of
the
questions
*NL*
of
the
moment
,
the
artillery
of
the
National
Guard
,
and
a
conflict
*NL*
between
the
Minister
of
War
and
``
the
citizen
's
militia
,
''
on
the
subject
*NL*
of
the
cannon
parked
in
the
courtyard
of
the
Louvre
.
The
students
were
*NL*
to
``
deliberate
''
over
this
.
It
did
not
take
much
more
than
this
to
swell
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
's
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
Marius
,
who
was
a
student
,
and
who
would
probably
go
with
*NL*
the
rest
,
to
``
deliberate
,
at
midday
,
on
the
Place
du
Pantheon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
indulging
in
this
painful
dream
,
Lieutenant
Theodule
entered
*NL*
clad
in
plain
clothes
as
a
bourgeois
,
which
was
clever
of
him
,
and
*NL*
was
discreetly
introduced
by
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
.
The
lancer
had
*NL*
reasoned
as
follows
:
``
The
old
druid
has
not
sunk
all
his
money
in
a
life
*NL*
pension
.
It
is
well
to
disguise
one
's
self
as
a
civilian
from
time
to
*NL*
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
said
aloud
to
her
father
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Theodule
,
your
grandnephew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
a
low
voice
to
the
lieutenant
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Approve
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lieutenant
,
who
was
but
little
accustomed
to
such
venerable
*NL*
encounters
,
stammered
with
some
timidity
:
``
Good
day
,
uncle
,
''
--
and
made
*NL*
a
salute
composed
of
the
involuntary
and
mechanical
outline
of
the
*NL*
military
salute
finished
off
as
a
bourgeois
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
it
's
you
;
that
is
well
,
sit
down
,
''
said
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
he
totally
forgot
the
lancer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Theodule
seated
himself
,
and
M.
Gillenormand
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
began
to
pace
back
and
forth
,
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
*NL*
talking
aloud
,
and
twitching
,
with
his
irritated
old
fingers
,
at
the
two
*NL*
watches
which
he
wore
in
his
two
fobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
pack
of
brats
!
they
convene
on
the
Place
du
Pantheon
!
by
my
life
!
*NL*
urchins
who
were
with
their
nurses
but
yesterday
!
If
one
were
to
squeeze
*NL*
their
noses
,
milk
would
burst
out
.
And
they
deliberate
to-morrow
,
at
*NL*
midday
.
What
are
we
coming
to
?
What
are
we
coming
to
?
It
is
clear
that
*NL*
we
are
making
for
the
abyss
.
That
is
what
the
descamisados
have
brought
*NL*
us
to
!
To
deliberate
on
the
citizen
artillery
!
To
go
and
jabber
in
the
*NL*
open
air
over
the
jibes
of
the
National
Guard
!
And
with
whom
are
they
to
*NL*
meet
there
?
Just
see
whither
Jacobinism
leads
.
I
will
bet
anything
you
*NL*
like
,
a
million
against
a
counter
,
that
there
will
be
no
one
there
but
*NL*
returned
convicts
and
released
galley-slaves
.
The
Republicans
and
the
*NL*
galley-slaves
,
--
they
form
but
one
nose
and
one
handkerchief
.
Carnot
used
*NL*
to
say
:
`
Where
would
you
have
me
go
,
traitor
?
'
Fouche
replied
:
`
Wherever
*NL*
you
please
,
imbecile
!
'
That
's
what
the
Republicans
are
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Theodule
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
half
turned
his
head
,
saw
Theodule
,
and
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
one
reflects
that
that
scoundrel
was
so
vile
as
to
turn
carbonaro
!
*NL*
Why
did
you
leave
my
house
?
To
go
and
become
a
Republican
!
Pssst
!
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
the
people
want
none
of
your
republic
,
they
have
common
*NL*
sense
,
they
know
well
that
there
always
have
been
kings
,
and
that
there
*NL*
always
will
be
;
they
know
well
that
the
people
are
only
the
people
,
*NL*
after
all
,
they
make
sport
of
it
,
of
your
republic
--
do
you
understand
,
*NL*
idiot
?
Is
it
not
a
horrible
caprice
?
To
fall
in
love
with
Pere
Duchesne
,
*NL*
to
make
sheep
's
-
eyes
at
the
guillotine
,
to
sing
romances
,
and
play
on
*NL*
the
guitar
under
the
balcony
of
'
93
--
it
's
enough
to
make
one
spit
on
all
*NL*
these
young
fellows
,
such
fools
are
they
!
They
are
all
alike
.
Not
one
*NL*
escapes
.
It
suffices
for
them
to
breathe
the
air
which
blows
through
the
*NL*
street
to
lose
their
senses
.
The
nineteenth
century
is
poison
.
The
*NL*
first
scamp
that
happens
along
lets
his
beard
grow
like
a
goat
's
,
*NL*
thinks
himself
a
real
scoundrel
,
and
abandons
his
old
relatives
.
He
's
*NL*
a
Republican
,
he
's
a
romantic
.
What
does
that
mean
,
romantic
?
Do
me
the
*NL*
favor
to
tell
me
what
it
is
.
All
possible
follies
.
A
year
ago
,
they
ran
*NL*
to
Hernani
.
Now
,
I
just
ask
you
,
Hernani
!
antitheses
!
abominations
*NL*
which
are
not
even
written
in
French
!
And
then
,
they
have
cannons
in
the
*NL*
courtyard
of
the
Louvre
.
Such
are
the
rascalities
of
this
age
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
uncle
,
''
said
Theodule
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cannons
in
the
courtyard
of
the
Museum
!
For
what
purpose
?
Do
you
want
*NL*
to
fire
grape-shot
at
the
Apollo
Belvedere
?
What
have
those
cartridges
*NL*
to
do
with
the
Venus
de
Medici
?
Oh
!
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
are
*NL*
all
blackguards
!
What
a
pretty
creature
is
their
Benjamin
Constant
!
And
*NL*
those
who
are
not
rascals
are
simpletons
!
They
do
all
they
can
to
make
*NL*
themselves
ugly
,
they
are
badly
dressed
,
they
are
afraid
of
women
,
in
*NL*
the
presence
of
petticoats
they
have
a
mendicant
air
which
sets
the
*NL*
girls
into
fits
of
laughter
;
on
my
word
of
honor
,
one
would
say
the
poor
*NL*
creatures
were
ashamed
of
love
.
They
are
deformed
,
and
they
complete
*NL*
themselves
by
being
stupid
;
they
repeat
the
puns
of
Tiercelin
and
*NL*
Potier
,
they
have
sack
coats
,
stablemen
's
waistcoats
,
shirts
of
coarse
*NL*
linen
,
trousers
of
coarse
cloth
,
boots
of
coarse
leather
,
and
their
*NL*
rigmarole
resembles
their
plumage
.
One
might
make
use
of
their
jargon
*NL*
to
put
new
soles
on
their
old
shoes
.
And
all
this
awkward
batch
of
brats
*NL*
has
political
opinions
,
if
you
please
.
Political
opinions
should
be
*NL*
strictly
forbidden
.
They
fabricate
systems
,
they
recast
society
,
they
*NL*
demolish
the
monarchy
,
they
fling
all
laws
to
the
earth
,
they
put
the
*NL*
attic
in
the
cellar
's
place
and
my
porter
in
the
place
of
the
King
,
they
*NL*
turn
Europe
topsy-turvy
,
they
reconstruct
the
world
,
and
all
their
love
*NL*
affairs
consist
in
staring
slily
at
the
ankles
of
the
laundresses
as
*NL*
these
women
climb
into
their
carts
.
Ah
!
Marius
!
Ah
!
you
blackguard
!
to
*NL*
go
and
vociferate
on
the
public
place
!
to
discuss
,
to
debate
,
to
take
*NL*
measures
!
They
call
that
measures
,
just
God
!
Disorder
humbles
itself
*NL*
and
becomes
silly
.
I
have
seen
chaos
,
I
now
see
a
mess
.
Students
*NL*
deliberating
on
the
National
Guard
,
--
such
a
thing
could
not
be
seen
*NL*
among
the
Ogibewas
nor
the
Cadodaches
!
Savages
who
go
naked
,
with
their
*NL*
noddles
dressed
like
a
shuttlecock
,
with
a
club
in
their
paws
,
are
less
*NL*
of
brutes
than
those
bachelors
of
arts
!
The
four-penny
monkeys
!
And
they
*NL*
set
up
for
judges
!
Those
creatures
deliberate
and
ratiocinate
!
The
*NL*
end
of
the
world
is
come
!
This
is
plainly
the
end
of
this
miserable
*NL*
terraqueous
globe
!
A
final
hiccough
was
required
,
and
France
has
emitted
*NL*
it
.
Deliberate
,
my
rascals
!
Such
things
will
happen
so
long
as
they
go
*NL*
and
read
the
newspapers
under
the
arcades
of
the
Odeon
.
That
costs
them
*NL*
a
sou
,
and
their
good
sense
,
and
their
intelligence
,
and
their
heart
and
*NL*
their
soul
,
and
their
wits
.
They
emerge
thence
,
and
decamp
from
their
*NL*
families
.
All
newspapers
are
pests
;
all
,
even
the
Drapeau
Blanc
!
At
*NL*
bottom
,
Martainville
was
a
Jacobin
.
Ah
!
just
Heaven
!
you
may
boast
of
*NL*
having
driven
your
grandfather
to
despair
,
that
you
may
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
evident
,
''
said
Theodule
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
profiting
by
the
fact
that
M.
Gillenormand
was
taking
breath
,
the
*NL*
lancer
added
in
a
magisterial
manner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
should
be
no
other
newspaper
than
the
Moniteur
,
and
no
other
book
*NL*
than
the
Annuaire
Militaire

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
their
Sieyes
!
A
regicide
ending
in
a
senator
;
for
that
is
*NL*
the
way

always
end
.
They
give
themselves
a
scar
with
the
address
*NL*
of
thou
as
citizens
,
in
order
to
get
themselves
called
,
eventually

big

I
will
do
myself
the
justice

say
,
*NL*
that
I
have
never
had
any
better
opinion
of
the
philosophies
of
all
*NL*
those

with
hats

They
were

would
have
pronounced

I
declare
to
you

that
your

is
madness

that

humanity
is
a

that

is
a

that
your

*NL*
is
a
monster
,
that
your
young

and
I
maintain
it
against
all

the

M.
Gillenormand
paused

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
SOBRIQUET
:
MODE
OF
FORMATION
OF
FAMILY
NAMES
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
,
at
this
epoch
,
a
handsome
young
man
,
of
medium
stature
,
*NL*
with
thick
and
intensely
black
hair
,
a
lofty
and
intelligent
brow
,
*NL*
well-opened
and
passionate
nostrils
,
an
air
of
calmness
and
sincerity
,
*NL*
and
with
something
indescribably
proud
,
thoughtful
,
and
innocent
over
*NL*
his
whole
countenance
.
His
profile
,
all
of
whose
lines
were
rounded
,
*NL*
without
thereby
losing
their
firmness
,
had
a
certain
Germanic
sweetness
,
*NL*
which
has
made
its
way
into
the
French
physiognomy
by
way
of
Alsace
*NL*
and
Lorraine
,
and
that
complete
absence
of
angles
which
rendered
*NL*
the
Sicambres
so
easily
recognizable
among
the
Romans
,
and
which
*NL*
distinguishes
the
leonine
from
the
aquiline
race
.
He
was
at
that
period
*NL*
of
life
when
the
mind
of
men
who
think
is
composed
,
in
nearly
equal
*NL*
parts
,
of
depth
and
ingenuousness
.
A
grave
situation
being
given
,
he
*NL*
had
all
that
is
required
to
be
stupid
:
one
more
turn
of
the
key
,
and
he
*NL*
might
be
sublime
.
His
manners
were
reserved
,
cold
,
polished
,
not
very
*NL*
genial
.
As
his
mouth
was
charming
,
his
lips
the
reddest
,
and
his
teeth
*NL*
the
whitest
in
the
world
,
his
smile
corrected
the
severity
of
his
face
,
*NL*
as
a
whole
.
At
certain
moments
,
that
pure
brow
and
that
voluptuous
smile
*NL*
presented
a
singular
contrast
.
His
eyes
were
small
,
but
his
glance
was
*NL*
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
period
of
his
most
abject
misery
,
he
had
observed
that
young
*NL*
girls
turned
round
when
he
passed
by
,
and
he
fled
or
hid
,
with
death
in
*NL*
his
soul
.
He
thought
that
they
were
staring
at
him
because
of
his
old
*NL*
clothes
,
and
that
they
were
laughing
at
them
;
the
fact
is
,
that
they
*NL*
stared
at
him
because
of
his
grace
,
and
that
they
dreamed
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
mute
misunderstanding
between
him
and
the
pretty
passers-by
had
*NL*
made
him
shy
.
He
chose
none
of
them
for
the
excellent
reason
that
*NL*
he
fled
from
all
of
them
.
He
lived
thus
indefinitely
,
--
stupidly
,
as
*NL*
Courfeyrac
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
also
said
to
him
:
``
Do
not
aspire
to
be
venerable
''
-LSB-
they
*NL*
called
each
other
thou
;
it
is
the
tendency
of
youthful
friendships
to
*NL*
slip
into
this
mode
of
address
-RSB-
.
``
Let
me
give
you
a
piece
of
advice
,
*NL*
my
dear
fellow
.
Do
n't
read
so
many
books
,
and
look
a
little
more
at
the
*NL*
lasses
.
The
jades
have
some
good
points
about
them
,
O
Marius
!
By
dint
of
*NL*
fleeing
and
blushing
,
you
will
become
brutalized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
other
occasions
,
Courfeyrac
encountered
him
and
said
:
--
``
Good
morning
,
*NL*
Monsieur
l'Abbe
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Courfeyrac
had
addressed
to
him
some
remark
of
this
nature
,
Marius
*NL*
avoided
women
,
both
young
and
old
,
more
than
ever
for
a
week
to
come
,
*NL*
and
he
avoided
Courfeyrac
to
boot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
existed
in
all
the
immensity
of
creation
,
two
women
*NL*
whom
Marius
did
not
flee
,
and
to
whom
he
paid
no
attention
whatever
.
In
*NL*
truth
,
he
would
have
been
very
much
amazed
if
he
had
been
informed
*NL*
that
they
were
women
.
One
was
the
bearded
old
woman
who
swept
out
his
*NL*
chamber
,
and
caused
Courfeyrac
to
say
:
``
Seeing
that
his
servant
woman
*NL*
wears
his
beard
,
Marius
does
not
wear
his
own
beard
.
''
The
other
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
little
girl
whom
he
saw
very
often
,
and
whom
he
never
looked
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
more
than
a
year
,
Marius
had
noticed
in
one
of
the
walks
of
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
,
the
one
which
skirts
the
parapet
of
the
Pepiniere
,
a
man
*NL*
and
a
very
young
girl
,
who
were
almost
always
seated
side
by
side
on
the
*NL*
same
bench
,
at
the
most
solitary
end
of
the
alley
,
on
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
*NL*
side
.
Every
time
that
that
chance
which
meddles
with
the
strolls
of
*NL*
persons
whose
gaze
is
turned
inwards
,
led
Marius
to
that
walk
,
--
and
it
*NL*
was
nearly
every
day
,
--
he
found
this
couple
there
.
The
man
appeared
to
*NL*
be
about
sixty
years
of
age
;
he
seemed
sad
and
serious
;
his
whole
person
*NL*
presented
the
robust
and
weary
aspect
peculiar
to
military
men
who
have
*NL*
retired
from
the
service
.
If
he
had
worn
a
decoration
,
Marius
would
have
*NL*
said
:
``
He
is
an
ex-officer
.
''
He
had
a
kindly
but
unapproachable
air
,
*NL*
and
he
never
let
his
glance
linger
on
the
eyes
of
any
one
.
He
wore
*NL*
blue
trousers
,
a
blue
frock
coat
and
a
broad-brimmed
hat
,
which
always
*NL*
appeared
to
be
new
,
a
black
cravat
,
a
quaker
shirt
,
that
is
to
say
,
it
*NL*
was
dazzlingly
white
,
but
of
coarse
linen
.
A
grisette
who
passed
near
*NL*
him
one
day
,
said
:
``
Here
's
a
very
tidy
widower
.
''
His
hair
was
very
*NL*
white
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
time
that
the
young
girl
who
accompanied
him
came
and
seated
*NL*
herself
on
the
bench
which
they
seemed
to
have
adopted
,
she
was
a
sort
*NL*
of
child
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
of
age
,
so
thin
as
to
be
almost
*NL*
homely
,
awkward
,
insignificant
,
and
with
a
possible
promise
of
*NL*
handsome
eyes
.
Only
,
they
were
always
raised
with
a
sort
of
displeasing
*NL*
assurance
.
Her
dress
was
both
aged
and
childish
,
like
the
dress
of
the
*NL*
scholars
in
a
convent
;
it
consisted
of
a
badly
cut
gown
of
black
merino
.
*NL*
They
had
the
air
of
being
father
and
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
scanned
this
old
man
,
who
was
not
yet
aged
,
and
this
little
*NL*
girl
,
who
was
not
yet
a
person
,
for
a
few
days
,
and
thereafter
paid
no
*NL*
attention
to
them
.
They
,
on
their
side
,
did
not
appear
even
to
see
him
.
*NL*
They
conversed
together
with
a
peaceful
and
indifferent
air
.
The
girl
*NL*
chattered
incessantly
and
merrily
.
The
old
man
talked
but
little
,
and
,
*NL*
at
times
,
he
fixed
on
her
eyes
overflowing
with
an
ineffable
paternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
acquired
the
mechanical
habit
of
strolling
in
that
walk
.
He
*NL*
invariably
found
them
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
way
things
went
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
liked
to
arrive
by
the
end
of
the
alley
which
was
furthest
from
*NL*
their
bench
;
he
walked
the
whole
length
of
the
alley
,
passed
in
front
*NL*
of
them
,
then
returned
to
the
extremity
whence
he
had
come
,
and
began
*NL*
again
.
This
he
did
five
or
six
times
in
the
course
of
his
promenade
,
*NL*
and
the
promenade
was
taken
five
or
six
times
a
week
,
without
its
*NL*
having
occurred
to
him
or
to
these
people
to
exchange
a
greeting
.
That
*NL*
personage
,
and
that
young
girl
,
although
they
appeared
,
--
and
perhaps
*NL*
because
they
appeared
,
--
to
shun
all
glances
,
had
,
naturally
,
caused
some
*NL*
attention
on
the
part
of
the
five
or
six
students
who
strolled
along
*NL*
the
Pepiniere
from
time
to
time
;
the
studious
after
their
lectures
,
*NL*
the
others
after
their
game
of
billiards
.
Courfeyrac
,
who
was
among
the
*NL*
last
,
had
observed
them
several
times
,
but
,
finding
the
girl
homely
,
he
*NL*
had
speedily
and
carefully
kept
out
of
the
way
.
He
had
fled
,
discharging
*NL*
at
them
a
sobriquet
,
like
a
Parthian
dart
.
Impressed
solely
with
*NL*
the
child
's
gown
and
the
old
man
's
hair
,
he
had
dubbed
the
daughter
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Lanoire
,
and
the
father
,
Monsieur
Leblanc
,
so
that
as
no
*NL*
one
knew
them
under
any
other
title
,
this
nickname
became
a
law
in
the
*NL*
default
of
any
other
name
.
The
students
said
:
``
Ah
!
Monsieur
Leblanc
is
*NL*
on
his
bench
.
''
And
Marius
,
like
the
rest
,
had
found
it
convenient
to
*NL*
call
this
unknown
gentleman
Monsieur
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
follow
their
example
,
and
we
shall
say
M.
Leblanc
,
in
order
to
*NL*
facilitate
this
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Marius
saw
them
nearly
every
day
,
at
the
same
hour
,
during
the
first
*NL*
year
.
He
found
the
man
to
his
taste
,
but
the
girl
insipid
.

CHAPTER
II
--
LUX
FACTA
EST
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
second
year
,
precisely
at
the
point
in
this
history
which
the
*NL*
reader
has
now
reached
,
it
chanced
that
this
habit
of
the
Luxembourg
was
*NL*
interrupted
,
without
Marius
himself
being
quite
aware
why
,
and
nearly
*NL*
six
months
elapsed
,
during
which
he
did
not
set
foot
in
the
alley
.
One
*NL*
day
,
at
last
,
he
returned
thither
once
more
;
it
was
a
serene
summer
*NL*
morning
,
and
Marius
was
in
joyous
mood
,
as
one
is
when
the
weather
is
*NL*
fine
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
in
his
heart
all
the
songs
of
the
*NL*
birds
that
he
was
listening
to
,
and
all
the
bits
of
blue
sky
of
which
he
*NL*
caught
glimpses
through
the
leaves
of
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
straight
to
``
his
alley
,
''
and
when
he
reached
the
end
of
it
he
*NL*
perceived
,
still
on
the
same
bench
,
that
well-known
couple
.
Only
,
when
*NL*
he
approached
,
it
certainly
was
the
same
man
;
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
it
was
no
longer
the
same
girl
.
The
person
whom
he
now
beheld
was
a
tall
*NL*
and
beautiful
creature
,
possessed
of
all
the
most
charming
lines
of
a
*NL*
woman
at
the
precise
moment
when
they
are
still
combined
with
all
the
*NL*
most
ingenuous
graces
of
the
child
;
a
pure
and
fugitive
moment
,
which
*NL*
can
be
expressed
only
by
these
two
words
,
--
``
fifteen
years
.
''
She
had
*NL*
wonderful
brown
hair
,
shaded
with
threads
of
gold
,
a
brow
that
seemed
*NL*
made
of
marble
,
cheeks
that
seemed
made
of
rose-leaf
,
a
pale
flush
,
*NL*
an
agitated
whiteness
,
an
exquisite
mouth
,
whence
smiles
darted
like
*NL*
sunbeams
,
and
words
like
music
,
a
head
such
as
Raphael
would
have
given
*NL*
to
Mary
,
set
upon
a
neck
that
Jean
Goujon
would
have
attributed
to
a
*NL*
Venus
.
And
,
in
order
that
nothing
might
be
lacking
to
this
bewitching
*NL*
face
,
her
nose
was
not
handsome
--
it
was
pretty
;
neither
straight
nor
*NL*
curved
,
neither
Italian
nor
Greek
;
it
was
the
Parisian
nose
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
spiritual
,
delicate
,
irregular
,
pure
,
--
which
drives
painters
to
*NL*
despair
,
and
charms
poets
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marius
passed
near
her
,
he
could
not
see
her
eyes
,
which
were
*NL*
constantly
lowered
.
He
saw
only
her
long
chestnut
lashes
,
permeated
with
*NL*
shadow
and
modesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
did
not
prevent
the
beautiful
child
from
smiling
as
she
listened
*NL*
to
what
the
white-haired
old
man
was
saying
to
her
,
and
nothing
could
*NL*
be
more
fascinating
than
that
fresh
smile
,
combined
with
those
drooping
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
,
Marius
thought
that
she
was
another
daughter
of
the
same
*NL*
man
,
a
sister
of
the
former
,
no
doubt
.
But
when
the
invariable
habit
of
*NL*
his
stroll
brought
him
,
for
the
second
time
,
near
the
bench
,
and
he
had
*NL*
examined
her
attentively
,
he
recognized
her
as
the
same
.
In
six
months
*NL*
the
little
girl
had
become
a
young
maiden
;
that
was
all
.
Nothing
is
more
*NL*
frequent
than
this
phenomenon
.
There
is
a
moment
when
girls
blossom
out
*NL*
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
and
become
roses
all
at
once
.
One
left
*NL*
them
children
but
yesterday
;
today
,
one
finds
them
disquieting
to
the
*NL*
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
child
had
not
only
grown
,
she
had
become
idealized
.
As
three
days
*NL*
in
April
suffice
to
cover
certain
trees
with
flowers
,
six
months
had
*NL*
sufficed
to
clothe
her
with
beauty
.
Her
April
had
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
sometimes
sees
people
,
who
,
poor
and
mean
,
seem
to
wake
up
,
pass
*NL*
suddenly
from
indigence
to
luxury
,
indulge
in
expenditures
of
all
sorts
,
*NL*
and
become
dazzling
,
prodigal
,
magnificent
,
all
of
a
sudden
.
That
is
*NL*
the
result
of
having
pocketed
an
income
;
a
note
fell
due
yesterday
.
The
*NL*
young
girl
had
received
her
quarterly
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
she
was
no
longer
the
school-girl
with
her
felt
hat
,
her
*NL*
merino
gown
,
her
scholar
's
shoes
,
and
red
hands
;
taste
had
come
to
her
*NL*
with
beauty
;
she
was
a
well-dressed
person
,
clad
with
a
sort
of
rich
*NL*
and
simple
elegance
,
and
without
affectation
.
She
wore
a
dress
of
black
*NL*
damask
,
a
cape
of
the
same
material
,
and
a
bonnet
of
white
crape
.
Her
*NL*
white
gloves
displayed
the
delicacy
of
the
hand
which
toyed
with
the
*NL*
carved
,
Chinese
ivory
handle
of
a
parasol
,
and
her
silken
shoe
outlined
*NL*
the
smallness
of
her
foot
.
When
one
passed
near
her
,
her
whole
toilette
*NL*
exhaled
a
youthful
and
penetrating
perfume
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
man
,
he
was
the
same
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
time
that
Marius
approached
her
,
the
young
girl
raised
her
*NL*
eyelids
;
her
eyes
were
of
a
deep
,
celestial
blue
,
but
in
that
veiled
*NL*
azure
,
there
was
,
as
yet
,
nothing
but
the
glance
of
a
child
.
She
looked
*NL*
at
Marius
indifferently
,
as
she
would
have
stared
at
the
brat
running
*NL*
beneath
the
sycamores
,
or
the
marble
vase
which
cast
a
shadow
on
the
*NL*
bench
,
and
Marius
,
on
his
side
,
continued
his
promenade
,
and
thought
*NL*
about
something
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
near
the
bench
where
the
young
girl
sat
,
five
or
six
times
,
*NL*
but
without
even
turning
his
eyes
in
her
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
days
,
he
returned
,
as
was
his
wont
,
to
the
Luxembourg
;
*NL*
as
usual
,
he
found
there
``
the
father
and
daughter
;
''
but
he
paid
no
*NL*
further
attention
to
them
.
He
thought
no
more
about
the
girl
now
that
*NL*
she
was
beautiful
than
he
had
when
she
was
homely
.
He
passed
very
near
*NL*
the
bench
where
she
sat
,
because
such
was
his
habit
.

CHAPTER
III
--
EFFECT
OF
THE
SPRING
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
the
air
was
warm
,
the
Luxembourg
was
inundated
with
light
*NL*
and
shade
,
the
sky
was
as
pure
as
though
the
angels
had
washed
it
that
*NL*
morning
,
the
sparrows
were
giving
vent
to
little
twitters
in
the
depths
*NL*
of
the
chestnut-trees
.
Marius
had
thrown
open
his
whole
soul
to
nature
,
*NL*
he
was
not
thinking
of
anything
,
he
simply
lived
and
breathed
,
he
passed
*NL*
near
the
bench
,
the
young
girl
raised
her
eyes
to
him
,
the
two
glances
*NL*
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
there
in
the
young
girl
's
glance
on
this
occasion
?
Marius
could
*NL*
not
have
told
.
There
was
nothing
and
there
was
everything
.
It
was
a
*NL*
strange
flash
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
eyes
,
and
he
pursued
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
had
just
seen
was
no
longer
the
ingenuous
and
simple
eye
of
a
*NL*
child
;
it
was
a
mysterious
gulf
which
had
half
opened
,
then
abruptly
*NL*
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
comes
a
day
when
the
young
girl
glances
in
this
manner
.
Woe
to
him
*NL*
who
chances
to
be
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
That
first
gaze
of
a
soul
which
does
not
,
as
yet
,
know
itself
,
is
*NL*
like
the
dawn
in
the
sky
.
It
is
the
awakening
of
something
radiant
*NL*
and
strange
.
Nothing
can
give
any
idea
of
the
dangerous
charm
of
that
*NL*
unexpected
gleam
,
which
flashes
suddenly
and
vaguely
forth
from
adorable
*NL*
shadows
,
and
which
is
composed
of
all
the
innocence
of
the
present
,
and
*NL*
of
all
the
passion
of
the
future
.
It
is
a
sort
of
undecided
tenderness
*NL*
which
reveals
itself
by
chance
,
and
which
waits
.
It
is
a
snare
which
*NL*
the
innocent
maiden
sets
unknown
to
herself
,
and
in
which
she
captures
*NL*
hearts
without
either
wishing
or
knowing
it
.
It
is
a
virgin
looking
like
*NL*
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
rare
that
a
profound
revery
does
not
spring
from
that
glance
,
*NL*
where
it
falls
.
All
purities
and
all
candors
meet
in
that
celestial
*NL*
and
fatal
gleam
which
,
more
than
all
the
best-planned
tender
glances
of
*NL*
coquettes
,
possesses
the
magic
power
of
causing
the
sudden
blossoming
,
*NL*
in
the
depths
of
the
soul
,
of
that
sombre
flower
,
impregnated
with
*NL*
perfume
and
with
poison
,
which
is
called
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
on
his
return
to
his
garret
,
Marius
cast
his
eyes
over
*NL*
his
garments
,
and
perceived
,
for
the
first
time
,
that
he
had
been
so
*NL*
slovenly
,
indecorous
,
and
inconceivably
stupid
as
to
go
for
his
walk
in
*NL*
the
Luxembourg
with
his
``
every-day
clothes
,
''
that
is
to
say
,
with
a
*NL*
hat
battered
near
the
band
,
coarse
carter
's
boots
,
black
trousers
*NL*
which
showed
white
at
the
knees
,
and
a
black
coat
which
was
pale
at
the
*NL*
elbows
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IV
--
BEGINNING
OF
A
GREAT
MALADY
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
at
the
accustomed
hour
,
Marius
drew
from
his
*NL*
wardrobe
his
new
coat
,
his
new
trousers
,
his
new
hat
,
and
his
new
*NL*
boots
;
he
clothed
himself
in
this
complete
panoply
,
put
on
his
gloves
,
a
*NL*
tremendous
luxury
,
and
set
off
for
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
thither
,
he
encountered
Courfeyrac
,
and
pretended
not
to
see
*NL*
him
.
Courfeyrac
,
on
his
return
home
,
said
to
his
friends
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
met
Marius
'
new
hat
and
new
coat
,
with
Marius
inside
*NL*
them
.
He
was
going
to
pass
an
examination
,
no
doubt
.
He
looked
utterly
*NL*
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
Luxembourg
,
Marius
made
the
tour
of
the
fountain
*NL*
basin
,
and
stared
at
the
swans
;
then
he
remained
for
a
long
time
in
*NL*
contemplation
before
a
statue
whose
head
was
perfectly
black
with
mould
,
*NL*
and
one
of
whose
hips
was
missing
.
Near
the
basin
there
was
a
bourgeois
*NL*
forty
years
of
age
,
with
a
prominent
stomach
,
who
was
holding
by
the
*NL*
hand
a
little
urchin
of
five
,
and
saying
to
him
:
``
Shun
excess
,
my
son
,
*NL*
keep
at
an
equal
distance
from
despotism
and
from
anarchy
.
''
Marius
*NL*
listened
to
this
bourgeois
.
Then
he
made
the
circuit
of
the
basin
once
*NL*
more
.
At
last
he
directed
his
course
towards
``
his
alley
,
''
slowly
,
and
as
*NL*
if
with
regret
.
One
would
have
said
that
he
was
both
forced
to
go
there
*NL*
and
withheld
from
doing
so
.
He
did
not
perceive
it
himself
,
and
thought
*NL*
that
he
was
doing
as
he
always
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
turning
into
the
walk
,
he
saw
M.
Leblanc
and
the
young
girl
at
the
*NL*
other
end
,
``
on
their
bench
.
''
He
buttoned
his
coat
up
to
the
very
top
,
*NL*
pulled
it
down
on
his
body
so
that
there
might
be
no
wrinkles
,
examined
,
*NL*
with
a
certain
complaisance
,
the
lustrous
gleams
of
his
trousers
,
and
*NL*
marched
on
the
bench
.
This
march
savored
of
an
attack
,
and
certainly
*NL*
of
a
desire
for
conquest
.
So
I
say
that
he
marched
on
the
bench
,
as
I
*NL*
should
say
:
``
Hannibal
marched
on
Rome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
all
his
movements
were
purely
mechanical
,
and
he
had
*NL*
interrupted
none
of
the
habitual
preoccupations
of
his
mind
and
labors
.
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
was
thinking
that
the
Manuel
du
Baccalaureat
was
*NL*
a
stupid
book
,
and
that
it
must
have
been
drawn
up
by
rare
idiots
,
to
*NL*
allow
of
three
tragedies
of
Racine
and
only
one
comedy
of
Moliere
being
*NL*
analyzed
therein
as
masterpieces
of
the
human
mind
.
There
was
a
piercing
*NL*
whistling
going
on
in
his
ears
.
As
he
approached
the
bench
,
he
held
*NL*
fast
to
the
folds
in
his
coat
,
and
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
young
girl
.
It
*NL*
seemed
to
him
that
she
filled
the
entire
extremity
of
the
alley
with
a
*NL*
vague
blue
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
proportion
as
he
drew
near
,
his
pace
slackened
more
and
more
.
On
*NL*
arriving
at
some
little
distance
from
the
bench
,
and
long
before
he
had
*NL*
reached
the
end
of
the
walk
,
he
halted
,
and
could
not
explain
to
himself
*NL*
why
he
retraced
his
steps
.
He
did
not
even
say
to
himself
that
he
would
*NL*
not
go
as
far
as
the
end
.
It
was
only
with
difficulty
that
the
young
*NL*
girl
could
have
perceived
him
in
the
distance
and
noted
his
fine
*NL*
appearance
in
his
new
clothes
.
Nevertheless
,
he
held
himself
very
erect
,
*NL*
in
case
any
one
should
be
looking
at
him
from
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
attained
the
opposite
end
,
then
came
back
,
and
this
time
he
*NL*
approached
a
little
nearer
to
the
bench
.
He
even
got
to
within
three
*NL*
intervals
of
trees
,
but
there
he
felt
an
indescribable
impossibility
of
*NL*
proceeding
further
,
and
he
hesitated
.
He
thought
he
saw
the
young
girl
's
*NL*
face
bending
towards
him
.
But
he
exerted
a
manly
and
violent
effort
,
*NL*
subdued
his
hesitation
,
and
walked
straight
ahead
.
A
few
seconds
later
,
*NL*
he
rushed
in
front
of
the
bench
,
erect
and
firm
,
reddening
to
the
very
*NL*
ears
,
without
daring
to
cast
a
glance
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
*NL*
left
,
with
his
hand
thrust
into
his
coat
like
a
statesman
.
At
the
moment
*NL*
when
he
passed
,
--
under
the
cannon
of
the
place
,
--
he
felt
his
heart
beat
*NL*
wildly
.
As
on
the
preceding
day
,
she
wore
her
damask
gown
and
her
crape
*NL*
bonnet
.
He
heard
an
ineffable
voice
,
which
must
have
been
``
her
voice
.
''
*NL*
She
was
talking
tranquilly
.
She
was
very
pretty
.
He
felt
it
,
although
he
*NL*
made
no
attempt
to
see
her
.
``
She
could
not
,
however
,
''
he
thought
,
``
help
*NL*
feeling
esteem
and
consideration
for
me
,
if
she
only
knew
that
I
am
*NL*
the
veritable
author
of
the
dissertation
on
Marcos
Obregon
de
la
Ronde
,
*NL*
which
M.
Francois
de
Neufchateau
put
,
as
though
it
were
his
own
,
at
the
*NL*
head
of
his
edition
of
Gil
Blas
.
''
He
went
beyond
the
bench
as
far
as
the
*NL*
extremity
of
the
walk
,
which
was
very
near
,
then
turned
on
his
heel
and
*NL*
passed
once
more
in
front
of
the
lovely
girl
.
This
time
,
he
was
very
*NL*
pale
.
Moreover
,
all
his
emotions
were
disagreeable
.
As
he
went
further
*NL*
from
the
bench
and
the
young
girl
,
and
while
his
back
was
turned
to
her
,
*NL*
he
fancied
that
she
was
gazing
after
him
,
and
that
made
him
stumble
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
attempt
to
approach
the
bench
again
;
he
halted
near
the
*NL*
middle
of
the
walk
,
and
there
,
a
thing
which
he
never
did
,
he
sat
down
,
*NL*
and
reflecting
in
the
most
profoundly
indistinct
depths
of
his
spirit
,
*NL*
that
after
all
,
it
was
hard
that
persons
whose
white
bonnet
and
black
*NL*
gown
he
admired
should
be
absolutely
insensible
to
his
splendid
trousers
*NL*
and
his
new
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
he
rose
,
as
though
he
were
*NL*
on
the
point
of
again
beginning
his
march
towards
that
bench
which
was
*NL*
surrounded
by
an
aureole
.
But
he
remained
standing
there
,
motionless
.
*NL*
For
the
first
time
in
fifteen
months
,
he
said
to
himself
that
that
*NL*
gentleman
who
sat
there
every
day
with
his
daughter
,
had
,
on
his
side
,
*NL*
noticed
him
,
and
probably
considered
his
assiduity
singular
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
time
,
also
,
he
was
conscious
of
some
irreverence
in
*NL*
designating
that
stranger
,
even
in
his
secret
thoughts
,
by
the
sobriquet
*NL*
of
M.
le
Blanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
thus
for
several
minutes
,
with
drooping
head
,
tracing
figures
*NL*
in
the
sand
,
with
the
cane
which
he
held
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
abruptly
in
the
direction
opposite
to
the
bench
,
to
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
and
his
daughter
,
and
went
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
he
forgot
to
dine
.
At
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
he
perceived
*NL*
this
fact
,
and
as
it
was
too
late
to
go
down
to
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
,
*NL*
he
said
:
``
Never
mind
!
''
and
ate
a
bit
of
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
go
to
bed
until
he
had
brushed
his
coat
and
folded
it
up
with
*NL*
great
care
.

CHAPTER

DIVRS
CLAPS
OF
THUNDER
FALL
ON
MA'AM
BOUGON
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
Ma'am
Bougon
,
as
Courfeyrac
styled
the
old
*NL*
portress-principal-tenant
,
housekeeper
of
the
Gorbeau
hovel
,
Ma'am
*NL*
Bougon
,
whose
name
was
,
in
reality
,
Madame
Burgon
,
as
we
have
found
*NL*
out
,
but
this
iconoclast
,
Courfeyrac
,
respected
nothing
,
--
Ma'am
Bougon
*NL*
observed
,
with
stupefaction
,
that
M.
Marius
was
going
out
again
in
his
*NL*
new
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
Luxembourg
again
,
but
he
did
not
proceed
further
than
his
*NL*
bench
midway
of
the
alley
.
He
seated
himself
there
,
as
on
the
preceding
*NL*
day
,
surveying
from
a
distance
,
and
clearly
making
out
,
the
white
*NL*
bonnet
,
the
black
dress
,
and
above
all
,
that
blue
light
.
He
did
not
stir
*NL*
from
it
,
and
only
went
home
when
the
gates
of
the
Luxembourg
closed
.
He
*NL*
did
not
see
M.
Leblanc
and
his
daughter
retire
.
He
concluded
that
they
*NL*
had
quitted
the
garden
by
the
gate
on
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
.
Later
on
,
*NL*
several
weeks
afterwards
,
when
he
came
to
think
it
over
,
he
could
never
*NL*
recall
where
he
had
dined
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
which
was
the
third
,
Ma'am
Bougon
was
*NL*
thunderstruck
.
Marius
went
out
in
his
new
coat
.
``
Three
days
in
*NL*
succession
!
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
follow
him
,
but
Marius
walked
briskly
,
and
with
immense
*NL*
strides
;
it
was
a
hippopotamus
undertaking
the
pursuit
of
a
chamois
.
*NL*
She
lost
sight
of
him
in
two
minutes
,
and
returned
breathless
,
*NL*
three-quarters
choked
with
asthma
,
and
furious
.
``
If
there
is
any
sense
,
''
*NL*
she
growled
,
``
in
putting
on
one
's
best
clothes
every
day
,
and
making
*NL*
people
run
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
betook
himself
to
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
was
there
with
M.
Leblanc
.
Marius
approached
as
near
as
*NL*
he
could
,
pretending
to
be
busy
reading
a
book
,
but
he
halted
afar
off
,
*NL*
then
returned
and
seated
himself
on
his
bench
,
where
he
spent
four
hours
*NL*
in
watching
the
house-sparrows
who
were
skipping
about
the
walk
,
and
who
*NL*
produced
on
him
the
impression
that
they
were
making
sport
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fortnight
passed
thus
.
Marius
went
to
the
Luxembourg
no
longer
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
strolling
there
,
but
to
seat
himself
always
in
the
same
spot
,
*NL*
and
that
without
knowing
why
.
Once
arrived
there
,
he
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
He
put
on
his
new
coat
every
morning
,
for
the
purpose
of
not
showing
*NL*
himself
,
and
he
began
all
over
again
on
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
decidedly
a
marvellous
beauty
.
The
only
remark
approaching
a
*NL*
criticism
,
that
could
be
made
,
was
,
that
the
contradiction
between
*NL*
her
gaze
,
which
was
melancholy
,
and
her
smile
,
which
was
merry
,
gave
*NL*
a
rather
wild
effect
to
her
face
,
which
sometimes
caused
this
sweet
*NL*
countenance
to
become
strange
without
ceasing
to
be
charming
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
TAKEN
PRISONER
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
the
last
days
of
the
second
week
,
Marius
was
seated
on
his
*NL*
bench
,
as
usual
,
holding
in
his
hand
an
open
book
,
of
which
he
had
not
*NL*
turned
a
page
for
the
last
two
hours
.
All
at
once
he
started
.
An
event
*NL*
was
taking
place
at
the
other
extremity
of
the
walk
.
Leblanc
and
his
*NL*
daughter
had
just
left
their
seat
,
and
the
daughter
had
taken
her
*NL*
father
's
arm
,
and
both
were
advancing
slowly
,
towards
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
alley
where
Marius
was
.
Marius
closed
his
book
,
then
opened
it
again
,
*NL*
then
forced
himself
to
read
;
he
trembled
;
the
aureole
was
coming
*NL*
straight
towards
him
.
``
Ah
!
good
Heavens
!
''
thought
he
,
``
I
shall
not
have
*NL*
time
to
strike
an
attitude
.
''
Still
the
white-haired
man
and
the
girl
*NL*
advanced
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
this
lasted
for
a
century
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
but
a
second
.
``
What
are
they
coming
in
this
direction
for
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
himself
.
``
What
!
She
will
pass
here
?
Her
feet
will
tread
this
sand
,
this
*NL*
walk
,
two
paces
from
me
?
''
He
was
utterly
upset
,
he
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
be
very
handsome
,
he
would
have
liked
to
own
the
cross
.
He
heard
the
*NL*
soft
and
measured
sound
of
their
approaching
footsteps
.
He
imagined
that
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
was
darting
angry
glances
at
him
.
``
Is
that
gentleman
going
to
*NL*
address
me
?
''
he
thought
to
himself
.
He
dropped
his
head
;
when
he
raised
*NL*
it
again
,
they
were
very
near
him
.
The
young
girl
passed
,
and
as
she
*NL*
passed
,
she
glanced
at
him
.
She
gazed
steadily
at
him
,
with
a
pensive
*NL*
sweetness
which
thrilled
Marius
from
head
to
foot
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
she
was
reproaching
him
for
having
allowed
so
long
a
time
to
elapse
*NL*
without
coming
as
far
as
her
,
and
that
she
was
saying
to
him
:
``
I
am
*NL*
coming
myself
.
''
Marius
was
dazzled
by
those
eyes
fraught
with
rays
and
*NL*
abysses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
his
brain
on
fire
.
She
had
come
to
him
,
what
joy
!
And
then
,
how
*NL*
she
had
looked
at
him
!
She
appeared
to
him
more
beautiful
than
he
had
*NL*
ever
seen
her
yet
.
Beautiful
with
a
beauty
which
was
wholly
feminine
and
*NL*
angelic
,
with
a
complete
beauty
which
would
have
made
Petrarch
sing
and
*NL*
Dante
kneel
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
floating
free
in
the
azure
*NL*
heavens
.
At
the
same
time
,
he
was
horribly
vexed
because
there
was
dust
*NL*
on
his
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
felt
sure
that
she
had
looked
at
his
boots
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
followed
her
with
his
eyes
until
she
disappeared
.
Then
he
started
*NL*
up
and
walked
about
the
Luxembourg
garden
like
a
madman
.
It
is
possible
*NL*
that
,
at
times
,
he
laughed
to
himself
and
talked
aloud
.
He
was
so
dreamy
*NL*
when
he
came
near
the
children
's
nurses
,
that
each
one
of
them
thought
*NL*
him
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
quitted
the
Luxembourg
,
hoping
to
find
her
again
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
encountered
Courfeyrac
under
the
arcades
of
the
Odeon
,
and
said
to
*NL*
him
:
``
Come
and
dine
with
me
.
''
They
went
off
to
Rousseau
's
and
spent
*NL*
six
francs
.
Marius
ate
like
an
ogre
.
He
gave
the
waiter
six
sous
.
At
*NL*
dessert
,
he
said
to
Courfeyrac
.
``
Have
you
read
the
paper
?
What
a
fine
*NL*
discourse
Audry
de
Puyraveau
delivered
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
desperately
in
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
he
said
to
Courfeyrac
:
``
I
will
treat
you
to
the
play
.
''
*NL*
They
went
to
the
Porte-Sainte-Martin
to
see
Frederick
in
l'Auberge
des
*NL*
Adrets
.
Marius
was
enormously
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
he
had
a
redoubled
attack
of
shyness
.
On
emerging
*NL*
from
the
theatre
,
he
refused
to
look
at
the
garter
of
a
modiste
who
was
*NL*
stepping
across
a
gutter
,
and
Courfeyrac
,
who
said
:
``
I
should
like
to
*NL*
put
that
woman
in
my
collection
,
''
almost
horrified
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
invited
him
to
breakfast
at
the
Cafe
Voltaire
on
the
*NL*
following
morning
.
Marius
went
thither
,
and
ate
even
more
than
on
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
.
He
was
very
thoughtful
and
very
merry
.
One
would
*NL*
have
said
that
he
was
taking
advantage
of
every
occasion
to
laugh
*NL*
uproariously
.
He
tenderly
embraced
some
man
or
other
from
the
provinces
,
*NL*
who
was
presented
to
him
.
A
circle
of
students
formed
round
the
table
,
*NL*
and
they
spoke
of
the
nonsense
paid
for
by
the
State
which
was
uttered
*NL*
from
the
rostrum
in
the
Sorbonne
,
then
the
conversation
fell
upon
the
*NL*
faults
and
omissions
in
Guicherat
's
dictionaries
and
grammars
.
Marius
*NL*
interrupted
the
discussion
to
exclaim
:
``
But
it
is
very
agreeable
,
all
*NL*
the
same
to
have
the
cross
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
queer
!
''
whispered
Courfeyrac
to
Jean
Prouvaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
responded
Prouvaire
,
``
that
's
serious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
serious
;
in
fact
,
Marius
had
reached
that
first
violent
and
*NL*
charming
hour
with
which
grand
passions
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glance
had
wrought
all
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
mine
is
charged
,
when
the
conflagration
is
ready
,
nothing
is
*NL*
more
simple
.
A
glance
is
a
spark
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
over
with
him
.
Marius
loved
a
woman
.
His
fate
was
entering
*NL*
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glance
of
women
resembles
certain
combinations
of
wheels
,
which
are
*NL*
tranquil
in
appearance
yet
formidable
.
You
pass
close
to
them
every
*NL*
day
,
peaceably
and
with
impunity
,
and
without
a
suspicion
of
anything
.
A
*NL*
moment
arrives
when
you
forget
that
the
thing
is
there
.
You
go
and
come
,
*NL*
dream
,
speak
,
laugh
.
All
at
once
you
feel
yourself
clutched
;
all
is
*NL*
over
.
The
wheels
hold
you
fast
,
the
glance
has
ensnared
you
.
It
has
*NL*
caught
you
,
no
matter
where
or
how
,
by
some
portion
of
your
thought
*NL*
which
was
fluttering
loose
,
by
some
distraction
which
had
attacked
you
.
*NL*
You
are
lost
.
The
whole
of
you
passes
into
it
.
A
chain
of
mysterious
*NL*
forces
takes
possession
of
you
.
You
struggle
in
vain
;
no
more
human
*NL*
succor
is
possible
.
You
go
on
falling
from
gearing
to
gearing
,
from
*NL*
agony
to
agony
,
from
torture
to
torture
,
you
,
your
mind
,
your
fortune
,
*NL*
your
future
,
your
soul
;
and
,
according
to
whether
you
are
in
the
power
*NL*
of
a
wicked
creature
,
or
of
a
noble
heart
,
you
will
not
escape
from
this
*NL*
terrifying
machine

ADVENTURES
OF
THE
LETTER
U
DELIVERED
OVER
TO
CONJECTURES
*NL*
*NL*
Isolation
,
detachment
from
everything
,
pride
,
independence
,
the
taste
*NL*
of
nature
,
the
absence
of
daily
and
material
activity
,
the
life
within
*NL*
himself
,
the
secret
conflicts
of
chastity
,
a
benevolent
ecstasy
towards
*NL*
all
creation
,
had
prepared
Marius
for
this
possession
which
is
called
*NL*
passion
.
His
worship
of
his
father
had
gradually
become
a
religion
,
*NL*
and
,
like
all
religions
,
it
had
retreated
to
the
depths
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
Something
was
required
in
the
foreground
.
Love
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
full
month
elapsed
,
during
which
Marius
went
every
day
to
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
.
When
the
hour
arrived
,
nothing
could
hold
him
back
.
--
``
He
*NL*
is
on
duty
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
Marius
lived
in
a
state
of
delight
.
It
is
*NL*
certain
that
the
young
girl
did
look
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
finally
grown
bold
,
and
approached
the
bench
.
Still
,
he
did
not
*NL*
pass
in
front
of
it
any
more
,
in
obedience
to
the
instinct
of
timidity
*NL*
and
to
the
instinct
of
prudence
common
to
lovers
.
He
considered
it
*NL*
better
not
to
attract
``
the
attention
of
the
father
.
''
He
combined
his
*NL*
stations
behind
the
trees
and
the
pedestals
of
the
statues
with
a
*NL*
profound
diplomacy
,
so
that
he
might
be
seen
as
much
as
possible
by
the
*NL*
young
girl
and
as
little
as
possible
by
the
old
gentleman
.
Sometimes
,
he
*NL*
remained
motionless
by
the
half-hour
together
in
the
shade
of
a
Leonidas
*NL*
or
a
Spartacus
,
holding
in
his
hand
a
book
,
above
which
his
eyes
,
gently
*NL*
raised
,
sought
the
beautiful
girl
,
and
she
,
on
her
side
,
turned
her
*NL*
charming
profile
towards
him
with
a
vague
smile
.
While
conversing
in
the
*NL*
most
natural
and
tranquil
manner
in
the
world
with
the
white-haired
man
,
*NL*
she
bent
upon
Marius
all
the
reveries
of
a
virginal
and
passionate
eye
.
*NL*
Ancient
and
time-honored
manoeuvre
which
Eve
understood
from
the
very
*NL*
first
day
of
the
world
,
and
which
every
woman
understands
from
the
very
*NL*
first
day
of
her
life
!
her
mouth
replied
to
one
,
and
her
glance
replied
*NL*
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
supposed
,
that
M.
Leblanc
finally
noticed
something
,
for
*NL*
often
,
when
Marius
arrived
,
he
rose
and
began
to
walk
about
.
He
had
*NL*
abandoned
their
accustomed
place
and
had
adopted
the
bench
by
the
*NL*
Gladiator
,
near
the
other
end
of
the
walk
,
as
though
with
the
object
*NL*
of
seeing
whether
Marius
would
pursue
them
thither
.
Marius
did
not
*NL*
understand
,
and
committed
this
error
.
``
The
father
''
began
to
grow
*NL*
inexact
,
and
no
longer
brought
``
his
daughter
''
every
day
.
Sometimes
,
he
*NL*
came
alone
.
Then
Marius
did
not
stay
.
Another
blunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
paid
no
heed
to
these
symptoms
.
From
the
phase
of
timidity
,
he
*NL*
had
passed
,
by
a
natural
and
fatal
progress
,
to
the
phase
of
blindness
.
*NL*
His
love
increased
.
He
dreamed
of
it
every
night
.
And
then
,
an
*NL*
unexpected
bliss
had
happened
to
him
,
oil
on
the
fire
,
a
redoubling
of
*NL*
the
shadows
over
his
eyes
.
One
evening
,
at
dusk
,
he
had
found
,
on
*NL*
the
bench
which
``
M.
Leblanc
and
his
daughter
''
had
just
quitted
,
a
*NL*
handkerchief
,
a
very
simple
handkerchief
,
without
embroidery
,
but
white
,
*NL*
and
fine
,
and
which
seemed
to
him
to
exhale
ineffable
perfume
.
He
seized
*NL*
it
with
rapture
.
This
handkerchief
was
marked
with
the
letters
U.
F.
*NL*
Marius
knew
nothing
about
this
beautiful
child
,
--
neither
her
family
*NL*
name
,
her
Christian
name
nor
her
abode
;
these
two
letters
were
the
first
*NL*
thing
of
her
that
he
had
gained
possession
of
,
adorable
initials
,
upon
*NL*
which
he
immediately
began
to
construct
his
scaffolding
.
U
was
evidently
*NL*
the
Christian
name
.
``
Ursule
!
''
he
thought
,
``
what
a
delicious
name
!
''
He
*NL*
kissed
the
handkerchief
,
drank
it
in
,
placed
it
on
his
heart
,
on
his
*NL*
flesh
,
during
the
day
,
and
at
night
,
laid
it
beneath
his
lips
that
he
*NL*
might
fall
asleep
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
that
her
whole
soul
lies
within
it
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
handkerchief
belonged
to
the
old
gentleman
,
who
had
simply
let
it
*NL*
fall
from
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
days
which
followed
the
finding
of
this
treasure
,
he
only
*NL*
displayed
himself
at
the
Luxembourg
in
the
act
of
kissing
the
*NL*
handkerchief
and
laying
it
on
his
heart
.
The
beautiful
child
understood
*NL*
nothing
of
all
this
,
and
signified
it
to
him
by
imperceptible
signs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
modesty
!
''
said
Marius
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
VETERANS
THEMSELVES
CAN
BE
HAPPY
*NL*
*NL*
Since
we
have
pronounced
the
word
modesty
,
and
since
we
conceal
nothing
,
*NL*
we
ought
to
say
that
once
,
nevertheless
,
in
spite
of
his
ecstasies
,
``
his
*NL*
Ursule
''
caused
him
very
serious
grief
.
It
was
on
one
of
the
days
when
*NL*
she
persuaded
M.
Leblanc
to
leave
the
bench
and
stroll
along
the
walk
.
*NL*
A
brisk
May
breeze
was
blowing
,
which
swayed
the
crests
of
the
*NL*
plaintain-trees
.
The
father
and
daughter
,
arm
in
arm
,
had
just
passed
*NL*
Marius
'
bench
.
Marius
had
risen
to
his
feet
behind
them
,
and
was
*NL*
following
them
with
his
eyes
,
as
was
fitting
in
the
desperate
situation
*NL*
of
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
a
gust
of
wind
,
more
merry
than
the
rest
,
and
probably
*NL*
charged
with
performing
the
affairs
of
Springtime
,
swept
down
from
*NL*
the
nursery
,
flung
itself
on
the
alley
,
enveloped
the
young
girl
in
*NL*
a
delicious
shiver
,
worthy
of
Virgil
's
nymphs
,
and
the
fawns
of
*NL*
Theocritus
,
and
lifted
her
dress
,
the
robe
more
sacred
than
that
of
*NL*
Isis
,
almost
to
the
height
of
her
garter
.
A
leg
of
exquisite
shape
*NL*
appeared
.
Marius
saw
it
.
He
was
exasperated
and
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
had
hastily
thrust
down
her
dress
,
with
a
divinely
*NL*
troubled
motion
,
but
he
was
none
the
less
angry
for
all
that
.
He
was
*NL*
alone
in
the
alley
,
it
is
true
.
But
there
might
have
been
some
one
*NL*
there
.
And
what
if
there
had
been
some
one
there
!
Can
any
one
comprehend
*NL*
such
a
thing
?
What
she
had
just
done
is
horrible
!
--
Alas
,
the
poor
child
*NL*
had
done
nothing
;
there
had
been
but
one
culprit
,
the
wind
;
but
Marius
,
*NL*
in
whom
quivered
the
Bartholo
who
exists
in
Cherubin
,
was
determined
to
*NL*
be
vexed
,
and
was
jealous
of
his
own
shadow
.
It
is
thus
,
in
fact
,
that
*NL*
the
harsh
and
capricious
jealousy
of
the
flesh
awakens
in
the
human
*NL*
heart
,
and
takes
possession
of
it
,
even
without
any
right
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
setting
aside
even
that
jealousy
,
the
sight
of
that
charming
leg
had
*NL*
contained
nothing
agreeable
for
him
;
the
white
stocking
of
the
first
*NL*
woman
he
chanced
to
meet
would
have
afforded
him
more
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
``
his
Ursule
,
''
after
having
reached
the
end
of
the
walk
,
retraced
*NL*
her
steps
with
M.
Leblanc
,
and
passed
in
front
of
the
bench
on
which
*NL*
Marius
had
seated
himself
once
more
,
Marius
darted
a
sullen
and
*NL*
ferocious
glance
at
her
.
The
young
girl
gave
way
to
that
slight
*NL*
straightening
up
with
a
backward
movement
,
accompanied
by
a
raising
of
*NL*
the
eyelids
,
which
signifies
:
``
Well
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
``
their
first
quarrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
hardly
made
this
scene
at
her
with
his
eyes
,
when
some
one
*NL*
crossed
the
walk
.
It
was
a
veteran
,
very
much
bent
,
extremely
wrinkled
,
*NL*
and
pale
,
in
a
uniform
of
the
Louis
XV
.
pattern
,
bearing
on
his
breast
*NL*
the
little
oval
plaque
of
red
cloth
,
with
the
crossed
swords
,
the
*NL*
soldier
's
cross
of
Saint-Louis
,
and
adorned
,
in
addition
,
with
a
*NL*
coat-sleeve
,
which
had
no
arm
within
it
,
with
a
silver
chin
and
a
wooden
*NL*
leg
.
Marius
thought
he
perceived
that
this
man
had
an
extremely
well
*NL*
satisfied
air
.
It
even
struck
him
that
the
aged
cynic
,
as
he
hobbled
*NL*
along
past
him
,
addressed
to
him
a
very
fraternal
and
very
merry
wink
,
*NL*
as
though
some
chance
had
created
an
understanding
between
them
,
and
as
*NL*
though
they
had
shared
some
piece
of
good
luck
together
.
What
did
that
*NL*
relic
of
Mars
mean
by
being
so
contented
?
What
had
passed
between
*NL*
that
wooden
leg
and
the
other
?
Marius
reached
a
paroxysm
of
*NL*
jealousy
.
--
``
Perhaps
he
was
there
!
''
he
said
to
himself
;
``
perhaps
he
*NL*
saw
!
''
--
And
he
felt
a
desire
to
exterminate
the
veteran
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
aid
of
time
,
all
points
grow
dull
.
Marius
'
wrath
against
*NL*
``
Ursule
,
''
just
and
legitimate
as
it
was
,
passed
off
.
He
finally
pardoned
*NL*
her
;
but
this
cost
him
a
great
effort
;
he
sulked
for
three
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
and
because
of
all
this
,
his
passion
*NL*
augmented
and
grew
to
madness
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
ECLIPSE
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
just
seen
how
Marius
discovered
,
or
thought
that
he
*NL*
discovered
,
that
She
was
named
Ursule
.
*NL*
*NL*
Appetite
grows
with
loving
.
To
know
that
her
name
was
Ursule
was
a
great
*NL*
deal
;
it
was
very
little
.
In
three
or
four
weeks
,
Marius
had
devoured
*NL*
this
bliss
.
He
wanted
another
.
He
wanted
to
know
where
she
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
committed
his
first
blunder
,
by
falling
into
the
ambush
of
the
*NL*
bench
by
the
Gladiator
.
He
had
committed
a
second
,
by
not
remaining
at
*NL*
the
Luxembourg
when
M.
Leblanc
came
thither
alone
.
He
now
committed
a
*NL*
third
,
and
an
immense
one
.
He
followed
``
Ursule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lived
in
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
in
the
most
unfrequented
spot
,
in
a
*NL*
new
,
three-story
house
,
of
modest
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
forth
,
Marius
added
to
his
happiness
of
seeing
her
at
*NL*
the
Luxembourg
the
happiness
of
following
her
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hunger
was
increasing
.
He
knew
her
first
name
,
at
least
,
a
charming
*NL*
name
,
a
genuine
woman
's
name
;
he
knew
where
she
lived
;
he
wanted
to
know
*NL*
who
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
after
he
had
followed
them
to
their
dwelling
,
and
had
seen
*NL*
them
disappear
through
the
carriage
gate
,
he
entered
in
their
train
and
*NL*
said
boldly
to
the
porter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
gentleman
who
lives
on
the
first
floor
,
who
has
just
come
*NL*
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
porter
.
``
He
is
the
gentleman
on
the
third
floor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
step
gained
.
This
success
emboldened
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
front
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parbleu
!
''
said
the
porter
,
``
the
house
is
only
built
on
the
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
is
that
gentleman
's
business
?
''
began
Marius
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
gentleman
of
property
,
sir
.
A
very
kind
man
who
does
good
to
*NL*
the
unfortunate
,
though
not
rich
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
his
name
?
''
resumed
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
raised
his
head
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
police
spy
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
went
off
quite
abashed
,
but
delighted
.
He
was
getting
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
thought
he
,
``
I
know
that
her
name
is
Ursule
,
that
she
is
the
*NL*
daughter
of
a
gentleman
who
lives
on
his
income
,
and
that
she
lives
*NL*
there
,
on
the
third
floor
,
in
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
M.
Leblanc
and
his
daughter
made
only
a
very
*NL*
brief
stay
in
the
Luxembourg
;
they
went
away
while
it
was
still
broad
*NL*
daylight
.
Marius
followed
them
to
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
as
he
had
taken
up
*NL*
the
habit
of
doing
.
On
arriving
at
the
carriage
entrance
M.
Leblanc
made
*NL*
his
daughter
pass
in
first
,
then
paused
,
before
crossing
the
threshold
,
*NL*
and
stared
intently
at
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
next
day
they
did
not
come
to
the
Luxembourg
.
Marius
waited
for
*NL*
them
all
day
in
vain
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nightfall
,
he
went
to
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
and
saw
a
light
in
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
third
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
about
beneath
the
windows
until
the
light
was
extinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
,
no
one
at
the
Luxembourg
.
Marius
waited
all
day
,
then
went
*NL*
and
did
sentinel
duty
under
their
windows
.
This
carried
him
on
to
ten
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
dinner
took
care
of
itself
.
Fever
nourishes
the
sick
man
,
and
love
*NL*
the
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
a
week
in
this
manner
.
M.
Leblanc
no
longer
appeared
at
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
indulged
in
melancholy
conjectures
;
he
dared
not
watch
the
porte
*NL*
cochere
during
the
day
;
he
contented
himself
with
going
at
night
to
gaze
*NL*
upon
the
red
light
of
the
windows
.
At
times
he
saw
shadows
flit
across
*NL*
them
,
and
his
heart
began
to
beat
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
eighth
day
,
when
he
arrived
under
the
windows
,
there
was
no
light
*NL*
in
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
''
he
said
,
``
the
lamp
is
not
lighted
yet
.
But
it
is
dark
.
Can
they
*NL*
have
gone
out
?
''
He
waited
until
ten
o'clock
.
Until
midnight
.
Until
one
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
Not
a
light
appeared
in
the
windows
of
the
third
story
,
*NL*
and
no
one
entered
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
away
in
a
very
gloomy
frame
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
,
--
for
he
only
existed
from
morrow
to
morrow
,
there
was
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
no
to-day
for
him
,
--
on
the
morrow
,
he
found
no
one
at
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
;
he
had
expected
this
.
At
dusk
,
he
went
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
light
in
the
windows
;
the
shades
were
drawn
;
the
third
floor
was
*NL*
totally
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
rapped
at
the
porte
cochere
,
entered
,
and
said
to
the
porter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
on
the
third
floor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
moved
away
,
''
replied
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
reeled
and
said
feebly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
ago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
living
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he
has
not
left
his
new
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
porter
,
raising
his
eyes
,
recognized
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
So
it
's
you
!
''
said
he
;
``
but
you
are
decidedly
a
spy
then
?

CHAPTER

--
MINES
AND
MINERS
*NL*
*NL*
Human
societies
all
have
what
is
called
in
theatrical
parlance
,
a
third
*NL*
lower
floor
.
The
social
soil
is
everywhere
undermined
,
sometimes
for
*NL*
good
,
sometimes
for
evil
.
These
works
are
superposed
one
upon
the
other
.
*NL*
There
are
superior
mines
and
inferior
mines
.
There
is
a
top
and
a
*NL*
bottom
in
this
obscure
sub-soil
,
which
sometimes
gives
way
beneath
*NL*
civilization
,
and
which
our
indifference
and
heedlessness
trample
under
*NL*
foot
.
The
Encyclopedia
,
in
the
last
century
,
was
a
mine
that
was
*NL*
almost
open
to
the
sky
.
The
shades
,
those
sombre
hatchers
of
primitive
*NL*
Christianity
,
only
awaited
an
opportunity
to
bring
about
an
explosion
*NL*
under
the
Caesars
and
to
inundate
the
human
race
with
light
.
For
in
the
*NL*
sacred
shadows
there
lies
latent
light
.
Volcanoes
are
full
of
a
shadow
*NL*
that
is
capable
of
flashing
forth
.
Every
form
begins
by
being
night
.
The
*NL*
catacombs
,
in
which
the
first
mass
was
said
,
were
not
alone
the
cellar
*NL*
of
Rome
,
they
were
the
vaults
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
the
social
construction
,
that
complicated
marvel
of
a
structure
,
*NL*
there
are
excavations
of
all
sorts
.
There
is
the
religious
mine
,
the
*NL*
philosophical
mine
,
the
economic
mine
,
the
revolutionary
mine
.
Such
and
*NL*
such
a
pick-axe
with
the
idea
,
such
a
pick
with
ciphers
.
Such
another
*NL*
with
wrath
.
People
hail
and
answer
each
other
from
one
catacomb
to
*NL*
another
.
Utopias
travel
about
underground
,
in
the
pipes
.
There
they
*NL*
branch
out
in
every
direction
.
They
sometimes
meet
,
and
fraternize
*NL*
there
.
Jean-Jacques
lends
his
pick
to
Diogenes
,
who
lends
him
his
*NL*
lantern
.
Sometimes
they
enter
into
combat
there
.
Calvin
seizes
Socinius
*NL*
by
the
hair
.
But
nothing
arrests
nor
interrupts
the
tension
of
all
these
*NL*
energies
toward
the
goal
,
and
the
vast
,
simultaneous
activity
,
which
*NL*
goes
and
comes
,
mounts
,
descends
,
and
mounts
again
in
these
obscurities
,
*NL*
and
which
immense
unknown
swarming
slowly
transforms
the
top
and
the
*NL*
bottom
and
the
inside
and
the
outside
.
Society
hardly
even
suspects
this
*NL*
digging
which
leaves
its
surface
intact
and
changes
its
bowels
.
There
*NL*
are
as
many
different
subterranean
stages
as
there
are
varying
works
,
*NL*
as
there
are
extractions
.
What
emerges
from
these
deep
excavations
?
The
*NL*
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deeper
one
goes
,
the
more
mysterious
are
the
toilers
.
The
work
*NL*
is
good
,
up
to
a
degree
which
the
social
philosophies
are
able
to
*NL*
recognize
;
beyond
that
degree
it
is
doubtful
and
mixed
;
lower
down
,
*NL*
it
becomes
terrible
.
At
a
certain
depth
,
the
excavations
are
no
longer
*NL*
penetrable
by
the
spirit
of
civilization
,
the
limit
breathable
by
man
*NL*
has
been
passed
;
a
beginning
of
monsters
is
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
descending
scale
is
a
strange
one
;
and
each
one
of
the
rungs
of
this
*NL*
ladder
corresponds
to
a
stage
where
philosophy
can
find
foothold
,
and
*NL*
where
one
encounters
one
of
these
workmen
,
sometimes
divine
,
sometimes
*NL*
misshapen
.
Below
John
Huss
,
there
is
Luther
;
below
Luther
,
there
is
*NL*
Descartes
;
below
Descartes
,
there
is
Voltaire
;
below
Voltaire
,
there
*NL*
is
Condorcet
;
below
Condorcet
,
there
is
Robespierre
;
below
Robespierre
,
*NL*
there
is
Marat
;
below
Marat
there
is
Babeuf
.
And
so
it
goes
on
.
Lower
*NL*
down
,
confusedly
,
at
the
limit
which
separates
the
indistinct
from
the
*NL*
invisible
,
one
perceives
other
gloomy
men
,
who
perhaps
do
not
exist
as
*NL*
yet
.
The
men
of
yesterday
are
spectres
;
those
of
to-morrow
are
forms
.
*NL*
The
eye
of
the
spirit
distinguishes
them
but
obscurely
.
The
embryonic
*NL*
work
of
the
future
is
one
of
the
visions
of
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
world
in
limbo
,
in
the
state
of
foetus
,
what
an
unheard-of
spectre
!
*NL*
*NL*
Saint-Simon
,
Owen
,
Fourier
,
are
there
also
,
in
lateral
galleries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
,
although
a
divine
and
invisible
chain
unknown
to
themselves
,
*NL*
binds
together
all
these
subterranean
pioneers
who
,
almost
always
,
think
*NL*
themselves
isolated
,
and
who
are
not
so
,
their
works
vary
greatly
,
and
*NL*
the
light
of
some
contrasts
with
the
blaze
of
others
.
The
first
are
*NL*
paradisiacal
,
the
last
are
tragic
.
Nevertheless
,
whatever
may
be
the
*NL*
contrast
,
all
these
toilers
,
from
the
highest
to
the
most
nocturnal
,
*NL*
from
the
wisest
to
the
most
foolish
,
possess
one
likeness
,
and
this
*NL*
is
it
:
disinterestedness
.
Marat
forgets
himself
like
Jesus
.
They
*NL*
throw
themselves
on
one
side
,
they
omit
themselves
,
they
think
not
of
*NL*
themselves
.
They
have
a
glance
,
and
that
glance
seeks
the
absolute
.
The
*NL*
first
has
the
whole
heavens
in
his
eyes
;
the
last
,
enigmatical
though
he
*NL*
may
be
,
has
still
,
beneath
his
eyelids
,
the
pale
beam
of
the
infinite
.
*NL*
Venerate
the
man
,
whoever
he
may
be
,
who
has
this
sign
--
the
starry
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shadowy
eye
is
the
other
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
it
,
evil
commences
.
Reflect
and
tremble
in
the
presence
of
any
one
*NL*
who
has
no
glance
at
all
.
The
social
order
has
its
black
miners
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
point
where
depth
is
tantamount
to
burial
,
and
where
light
*NL*
becomes
extinct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Below
all
these
mines
which
we
have
just
mentioned
,
below
all
these
*NL*
galleries
,
below
this
whole
immense
,
subterranean
,
venous
system
of
*NL*
progress
and
utopia
,
much
further
on
in
the
earth
,
much
lower
than
*NL*
Marat
,
lower
than
Babeuf
,
lower
,
much
lower
,
and
without
any
connection
*NL*
with
the
upper
levels
,
there
lies
the
last
mine
.
A
formidable
spot
.
This
*NL*
is
what
we
have
designated
as
the
le
troisieme
dessous
.
It
is
the
grave
*NL*
of
shadows
.
It
is
the
cellar
of
the
blind
.
Inferi
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
communicates
with
the
abyss
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
II
--
THE
LOWEST
DEPTHS
*NL*
*NL*
There
disinterestedness
vanishes
.
The
demon
is
vaguely
outlined
;
each
*NL*
one
is
for
himself
.
The
_
I
_
in
the
eyes
howls
,
seeks
,
fumbles
,
and
*NL*
gnaws
.
The
social
Ugolino
is
in
this
gulf
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wild
spectres
who
roam
in
this
grave
,
almost
beasts
,
almost
*NL*
phantoms
,
are
not
occupied
with
universal
progress
;
they
are
ignorant
*NL*
both
of
the
idea
and
of
the
word
;
they
take
no
thought
for
anything
*NL*
but
the
satisfaction
of
their
individual
desires
.
They
are
almost
*NL*
unconscious
,
and
there
exists
within
them
a
sort
of
terrible
*NL*
obliteration
.
They
have
two
mothers
,
both
step-mothers
,
ignorance
and
*NL*
misery
.
They
have
a
guide
,
necessity
;
and
for
all
forms
of
satisfaction
,
*NL*
appetite
.
They
are
brutally
voracious
,
that
is
to
say
,
ferocious
,
not
*NL*
after
the
fashion
of
the
tyrant
,
but
after
the
fashion
of
the
tiger
.
*NL*
From
suffering
these
spectres
pass
to
crime
;
fatal
affiliation
,
dizzy
*NL*
creation
,
logic
of
darkness
.
That
which
crawls
in
the
social
third
lower
*NL*
level
is
no
longer
complaint
stifled
by
the
absolute
;
it
is
the
protest
*NL*
of
matter
.
Man
there
becomes
a
dragon
.
To
be
hungry
,
to
be
thirsty
--
that
*NL*
is
the
point
of
departure
;
to
be
Satan
--
that
is
the
point
reached
.
From
*NL*
that
vault
Lacenaire
emerges
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
just
seen
,
in
Book
Fourth
,
one
of
the
compartments
of
the
*NL*
upper
mine
,
of
the
great
political
,
revolutionary
,
and
philosophical
*NL*
excavation
.
There
,
as
we
have
just
said
,
all
is
pure
,
noble
,
dignified
,
*NL*
honest
.
There
,
assuredly
,
one
might
be
misled
;
but
error
is
worthy
of
*NL*
veneration
there
,
so
thoroughly
does
it
imply
heroism
.
The
work
there
*NL*
effected
,
taken
as
a
whole
has
a
name
:
Progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
has
now
come
when
we
must
take
a
look
at
other
depths
,
*NL*
hideous
depths
.
There
exists
beneath
society
,
we
insist
upon
this
point
,
*NL*
and
there
will
exist
,
until
that
day
when
ignorance
shall
be
dissipated
,
*NL*
the
great
cavern
of
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cavern
is
below
all
,
and
is
the
foe
of
all
.
It
is
hatred
,
without
*NL*
exception
.
This
cavern
knows
no
philosophers
;
its
dagger
has
never
cut
*NL*
a
pen
.
Its
blackness
has
no
connection
with
the
sublime
blackness
of
the
*NL*
inkstand
.
Never
have
the
fingers
of
night
which
contract
beneath
this
*NL*
stifling
ceiling
,
turned
the
leaves
of
a
book
nor
unfolded
a
newspaper
.
*NL*
Babeuf
is
a
speculator
to
Cartouche
;
Marat
is
an
aristocrat
to
*NL*
Schinderhannes
.
This
cavern
has
for
its
object
the
destruction
of
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
everything
.
Including
the
upper
superior
mines
,
which
it
execrates
.
*NL*
It
not
only
undermines
,
in
its
hideous
swarming
,
the
actual
social
*NL*
order
;
it
undermines
philosophy
,
it
undermines
human
thought
,
it
*NL*
undermines
civilization
,
it
undermines
revolution
,
it
undermines
*NL*
progress
.
Its
name
is
simply
theft
,
prostitution
,
murder
,
assassination
.
*NL*
It
is
darkness
,
and
it
desires
chaos
.
Its
vault
is
formed
of
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
others
,
those
above
it
,
have
but
one
object
--
to
suppress
it
.
*NL*
It
is
to
this
point
that
philosophy
and
progress
tend
,
with
all
their
*NL*
organs
simultaneously
,
by
their
amelioration
of
the
real
,
as
well
as
by
*NL*
their
contemplation
of
the
absolute
.
Destroy
the
cavern
Ignorance
and
*NL*
you
destroy
the
lair
Crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
condense
,
in
a
few
words
,
a
part
of
what
we
have
just
written
.
*NL*
The
only
social
peril
is
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Humanity
is
identity
.
All
men
are
made
of
the
same
clay
.
There
is
no
*NL*
difference
,
here
below
,
at
least
,
in
predestination
.
The
same
shadow
*NL*
in
front
,
the
same
flesh
in
the
present
,
the
same
ashes
afterwards
.
But
*NL*
ignorance
,
mingled
with
the
human
paste
,
blackens
it
.
This
incurable
*NL*
blackness
takes
possession
of
the
interior
of
a
man
and
is
there
*NL*
converted
into
evil
.

CHAPTER
III
--
BABET
,
GUEULEMER
,
CLAQUESOUS
,
AND
MONTPARNASSE
*NL*
*NL*
A
quartette
of
ruffians
,
Claquesous
,
Gueulemer
,
Babet
,
and
Montparnasse
*NL*
governed
the
third
lower
floor
of
Paris
,
from
1830
to
1835
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gueulemer
was
a
Hercules
of
no
defined
position
.
For
his
lair
he
had
the
*NL*
sewer
of
the
Arche-Marion
.
He
was
six
feet
high
,
his
pectoral
muscles
*NL*
were
of
marble
,
his
biceps
of
brass
,
his
breath
was
that
of
a
cavern
,
*NL*
his
torso
that
of
a
colossus
,
his
head
that
of
a
bird
.
One
thought
one
*NL*
beheld
the
Farnese
Hercules
clad
in
duck
trousers
and
a
cotton
velvet
*NL*
waistcoat
.
Gueulemer
,
built
after
this
sculptural
fashion
,
might
have
*NL*
subdued
monsters
;
he
had
found
it
more
expeditious
to
be
one
.
A
low
*NL*
brow
,
large
temples
,
less
than
forty
years
of
age
,
but
with
crow
's
-
feet
,
*NL*
harsh
,
short
hair
,
cheeks
like
a
brush
,
a
beard
like
that
of
a
wild
*NL*
boar
;
the
reader
can
see
the
man
before
him
.
His
muscles
called
for
*NL*
work
,
his
stupidity
would
have
none
of
it
.
He
was
a
great
,
idle
force
.
*NL*
He
was
an
assassin
through
coolness
.
He
was
thought
to

He
*NL*
had
,
probably
,
somewhat
to
do
with
Marshal
Brune
,
having
been
a
porter
*NL*
at
Avignon
in
1815
.
After
this
stage
,
he
had
turned
ruffian
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
diaphaneity
of
Babet
contrasted
with
the
grossness
of
Gueulemer
.
*NL*
Babet
was
thin
and
learned
.
He
was
transparent
but
impenetrable
.
*NL*
Daylight
was
visible
through
his
bones
,
but
nothing
through
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
declared
that
he
was
a
chemist
.
He
had
been
a
jack
of
all
trades
.
He
had
*NL*
played
in
vaudeville
at
Saint-Mihiel
.
He
was
a
man
of
purpose
,
a
fine
*NL*
talker
,
who
underlined
his
smiles
and
accentuated
his
gestures
.
His
*NL*
occupation
consisted
in
selling
,
in
the
open
air
,
plaster
busts
and
*NL*
portraits
of
``
the
head
of
the
State
.
''
In
addition
to
this
,
he
extracted
*NL*
teeth
.
He
had
exhibited
phenomena
at
fairs
,
and
he
had
owned
a
booth
*NL*
with
a
trumpet
and
this
poster
:
``
Babet

''
This
Take
*NL*
advantage
of
this
opportunity
meant
:
Have
as
many
teeth
extracted
as
*NL*
possible
.
He
had
been
married
and
had
had
children
.
He
did
not
know
what
*NL*
had
become
of
his
wife
and
children
.
He
had
lost
them
as
one
loses
his
*NL*
handkerchief
.
Babet
read
the
papers
,
a
striking
exception
in
the
world
*NL*
to
which
he
belonged
.
One
day
,
at
the
period
when
he
had
his
family
with
*NL*
him
in
his
booth
on
wheels
,
he
had
read
in
the
Messager
,
that
a
woman
*NL*
had
just
given
birth
to
a
child
,
who
was
doing
well
,
and
had
a
calf
's
*NL*
muzzle
,
and
he
exclaimed
:
``
There
's
a
fortune
!
my
wife
has
not
the
wit
to
*NL*
present
me
with
a
child
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
he
had
abandoned
everything
,
in
order
to
``
undertake
Paris
.
''
*NL*
This
was
his
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
Claquesous
?
He
was
night
.
He
waited
until
the
sky
was
daubed
*NL*
with
black
,
before
he
showed
himself
.
At
nightfall
he
emerged
from
the
*NL*
hole
whither
he
returned
before
daylight
.
Where
was
this
hole
?
No
one
*NL*
knew
.
He
only
addressed
his
accomplices
in
the
most
absolute
darkness
,
*NL*
and
with
his
back
turned
to
them
.
Was
his
name
Claquesous
?
Certainly
*NL*
not
.
If
a
candle
was
brought
,
he
put
on
a
mask
.
He
was
a
ventriloquist
.
*NL*
Babet
said
:
``
Claquesous
is
a
nocturne
for
two
voices
.
''
Claquesous
was
*NL*
vague
,
terrible
,
and
a
roamer
.
No
one
was
sure
whether
he
had
a
name
,
*NL*
Claquesous
being
a
sobriquet
;
none
was
sure
that
he
had
a
voice
,
as
his
*NL*
stomach
spoke
more
frequently
than
his
voice
;
no
one
was
sure
that
he
*NL*
had
a
face
,
as
he
was
never
seen
without
his
mask
.
He
disappeared
as
*NL*
though
he
had
vanished
into
thin
air
;
when
he
appeared
,
it
was
as
though
*NL*
he
sprang
from
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lugubrious
being
was
Montparnasse
.
Montparnasse
was
a
child
;
less
than
*NL*
twenty
years
of
age
,
with
a
handsome
face
,
lips
like
cherries
,
charming
*NL*
black
hair
,
the
brilliant
light
of
springtime
in
his
eyes
;
he
had
all
*NL*
vices
and
aspired
to
all
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
digestion
of
evil
aroused
in
him
an
appetite
for
worse
.
It
was
the
*NL*
street
boy
turned
pickpocket
,
and
a
pickpocket
turned
garroter
.
He
was
*NL*
genteel
,
effeminate
,
graceful
,
robust
,
sluggish
,
ferocious
.
The
rim
of
*NL*
his
hat
was
curled
up
on
the
left
side
,
in
order
to
make
room
for
a
tuft
*NL*
of
hair
,
after
the
style
of
1829
.
He
lived
by
robbery
with
violence
.
*NL*
His
coat
was
of
the
best
cut
,
but
threadbare
.
Montparnasse
was
a
*NL*
fashion-plate
in
misery
and
given
to
the
commission
of
murders
.
The
*NL*
cause
of
all
this
youth
's
crimes
was
the
desire
to
be
well-dressed
.
The
*NL*
first
grisette
who
had
said
to
him
:
``
You
are
handsome
!
''
had
cast
the
*NL*
stain
of
darkness
into
his
heart
,
and
had
made
a
Cain
of
this
Abel
.
*NL*
Finding
that
he
was
handsome
,
he
desired
to
be
elegant
:
now
,
the
*NL*
height
of
elegance
is
idleness
;
idleness
in
a
poor
man
means
crime
.
Few
*NL*
prowlers
were
so
dreaded
as
Montparnasse
.
At
eighteen
,
he
had
already
*NL*
numerous
corpses
in
his
past
.
More
than
one
passer-by
lay
with
*NL*
outstretched
arms
in
the
presence
of
this
wretch
,
with
his
face
in
a
*NL*
pool
of
blood
.
Curled
,
pomaded
,
with
laced
waist
,
the
hips
of
a
woman
,
*NL*
the
bust
of
a
Prussian
officer
,
the
murmur
of
admiration
from
the
*NL*
boulevard
wenches
surrounding
him
,
his
cravat
knowingly
tied
,
a
bludgeon
*NL*
in
his
pocket
,
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
;
such
was
this
dandy
of
the
*NL*
sepulchre
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
COMPOSITION
OF
THE
TROUPE
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
ruffians
formed
a
sort
of
Proteus
,
winding
like
a
serpent
*NL*
among
the
police
,
and
striving
to
escape
Vidocq
's
indiscreet
glances
*NL*
``
under
divers
forms
,
tree
,
flame
,
fountain
,
''
lending
each
other
their
*NL*
names
and
their
traps
,
hiding
in
their
own
shadows
,
boxes
with
*NL*
secret
compartments
and
refuges
for
each
other
,
stripping
off
their
*NL*
personalities
,
as
one
removes
his
false
nose
at
a
masked
ball
,
sometimes
*NL*
simplifying
matters
to
the
point
of
consisting
of
but
one
individual
,
*NL*
sometimes
multiplying
themselves
to
such
a
point
that
Coco-Latour
*NL*
himself
took
them
for
a
whole
throng
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
men
were
not
four
men
;
they
were
a
sort
of
mysterious
robber
*NL*
with
four
heads
,
operating
on
a
grand
scale
on
Paris
;
they
were
that
*NL*
monstrous
polyp
of
evil
,
which
inhabits
the
crypt
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
their
ramifications
,
and
to
the
network
underlying
their
*NL*
relations
,
Babet
,
Gueulemer
,
Claquesous
,
and
Montparnasse
were
charged
*NL*
with
the
general
enterprise
of
the
ambushes
of
the
department
of
*NL*
the
Seine
.
The
inventors
of
ideas
of
that
nature
,
men
with
nocturnal
*NL*
imaginations
,
applied
to
them
to
have
their
ideas
executed
.
They
*NL*
furnished
the
canvas
to
the
four
rascals
,
and
the
latter
undertook
the
*NL*
preparation
of
the
scenery
.
They
labored
at
the
stage
setting
.
They
were
*NL*
always
in
a
condition
to
lend
a
force
proportioned
and
suitable
to
*NL*
all
crimes
which
demanded
a
lift
of
the
shoulder
,
and
which
were
*NL*
sufficiently
lucrative
.
When
a
crime
was
in
quest
of
arms
,
they
*NL*
under-let
their
accomplices
.
They
kept
a
troupe
of
actors
of
the
shadows
*NL*
at
the
disposition
of
all
underground
tragedies
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
the
habit
of
assembling
at
nightfall
,
the
hour
when
they
*NL*
woke
up
,
on
the
plains
which
adjoin
the
Salpetriere
.
There
they
held
*NL*
their
conferences
.
They
had
twelve
black
hours
before
them
;
they
*NL*
regulated
their
employment
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Patron-Minette
,
--
such
was
the
name
which
was
bestowed
in
the
*NL*
subterranean
circulation
on
the
association
of
these
four
men
.
In
the
*NL*
fantastic
,
ancient
,
popular
parlance
,
which
is
vanishing
day
by
day
,
*NL*
Patron-Minette
signifies
the
morning
,
the
same
as
entre
chien
et
*NL*
loup
--
between
dog
and
wolf
--
signifies
the
evening
.
This
appellation
,
*NL*
Patron-Minette
,
was
probably
derived
from
the
hour
at
which
their
work
*NL*
ended
,
the
dawn
being
the
vanishing
moment
for
phantoms
and
for
the
*NL*
separation
of
ruffians
.
These
four
men
were
known
under
this
title
.
*NL*
When
the
President
of
the
Assizes
visited
Lacenaire
in
his
prison
,
and
*NL*
questioned
him
concerning
a
misdeed
which
Lacenaire
denied
,
``
Who
did
*NL*
it
?
''
demanded
the
President
.
Lacenaire
made
this
response
,
enigmatical
*NL*
so
far
as
the
magistrate
was
concerned
,
but
clear
to
the
police
:
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
Patron-Minette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
piece
can
sometimes
be
divined
on
the
enunciation
of
the
personages
;
*NL*
in
the
same
manner
a
band
can
almost
be
judged
from
the
list
of
ruffians
*NL*
composing
it
.
Here
are
the
appellations
to
which
the
principal
members
*NL*
of
Patron-Minette
answered
,
--
for
the
names
have
survived

*NL*
We
pass
over
some
,
and
not
the
worst
of
them
.
These
names
have
faces
*NL*
attached
.
They
do
not
express
merely
beings
,
but
species
.
Each
one
of
*NL*
these
names
corresponds
to
a
variety
of
those
misshapen
fungi
from
the
*NL*
under
side
of
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
beings
,
who
were
not
very
lavish
with
their
countenances
,
were
not
*NL*
among
the
men
whom
one
sees
passing
along
the
streets
.
Fatigued
by
the
*NL*
wild
nights
which
they
passed
,
they
went
off
by
day
to
sleep
,
sometimes
*NL*
in
the
lime-kilns
,
sometimes
in
the
abandoned
quarries
of
Montmatre
or
*NL*
Montrouge
,
sometimes
in
the
sewers
.
They
ran
to
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
became
of
these
men
?
They
still
exist
.
They
have
always
existed
.
*NL*
Horace
speaks
of
them
:
Ambubaiarum
collegia
,
pharmacopolae
,
mendici
,
*NL*
mimae
;
and
so
long
as
society
remains
what
it
is
,
they
will
remain
what
*NL*
they
are
.
Beneath
the
obscure
roof
of
their
cavern
,
they
are
continually
*NL*
born
again
from
the
social
ooze
.
They
return
,
spectres
,
but
always
*NL*
identical
;
only
,
they
no
longer
bear
the
same
names
and
they
are
*NL*
no
longer
in
the
same
skins
.
The
individuals
extirpated
,
the
tribe
*NL*
subsists
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
always
have
the
same
faculties
.
From
the
vagrant
to
the
tramp
,
the
*NL*
race
is
maintained
in
its
purity
.
They
divine
purses
in
pockets
,
they
*NL*
scent
out
watches
in
fobs
.
Gold
and
silver
possess
an
odor
for
them
.
*NL*
There
exist
ingenuous
bourgeois
,
of
whom
it
might
be
said
,
that
they
*NL*
have
a
``
stealable
''
air
.
These
men
patiently
pursue
these
bourgeois
.
They
*NL*
experience
the
quivers
of
a
spider
at
the
passage
of
a
stranger
or
of
a
*NL*
man
from
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
men
are
terrible
,
when
one
encounters
them
,
or
catches
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
them
,
towards
midnight
,
on
a
deserted
boulevard
.
They
do
not
seem
*NL*
to
be
men
but
forms
composed
of
living
mists
;
one
would
say
that
they
*NL*
habitually
constitute
one
mass
with
the
shadows
,
that
they
are
in
*NL*
no
wise
distinct
from
them
,
that
they
possess
no
other
soul
than
the
*NL*
darkness
,
and
that
it
is
only
momentarily
and
for
the
purpose
of
living
*NL*
for
a
few
minutes
a
monstrous
life
,
that
they
have
separated
from
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
necessary
to
cause
these
spectres
to
vanish

He
sought

Marius

he

He
fell

pleasure
in
his
thoughts
.
To
everything
that
they
proposed
to
him
*NL*
in
a
whisper
,
he
replied
in
his
darkness
:
``
What
is
the
use
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
heaped
a
hundred
reproaches
on
himself
.
``
Why
did
I
follow
her
?
I
*NL*
was
so
happy
at
the
mere
sight
of
her
!
She
looked
at
me
;
was
not
that
*NL*
immense
?
She
had
the
air
of
loving
me
.
Was
not
that
everything
?
I
wished
*NL*
to
have
,
what
?
There
was
nothing
after
that
.
I
have
been
absurd
.
It
is
*NL*
my
own
fault
,
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
Courfeyrac
,
to
whom
he
confided
nothing
,
--
it
*NL*
was
his
nature
,
--
but
who
made
some
little
guess
at
everything
,
--
that
was
*NL*
his
nature
,
--
had
begun
by
congratulating
him
on
being
in
love
,
though
he
*NL*
was
amazed
at
it
;
then
,
seeing
Marius
fall
into
this
melancholy
state
,
*NL*
he
ended
by
saying
to
him
:
``
I
see
that
you
have
been
simply
an
animal
.
*NL*
Here
,
come
to
the
Chaumiere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
having
confidence
in
a
fine
September
sun
,
Marius
had
allowed
*NL*
himself
to
be
taken
to
the
ball
at
Sceaux
by
Courfeyrac
,
Bossuet
,
and
*NL*
Grantaire
,
hoping
,
what
a
dream
!
that
he
might
,
perhaps
,
find
her
there
.
*NL*
Of
course
he
did
not
see
the
one
he
sought
.
--
``
But
this
is
the
place
,
*NL*
all
the
same
,
where
all
lost
women
are
found
,
''
grumbled
Grantaire
in
an
*NL*
aside
.
Marius
left
his
friends
at
the
ball
and
returned
home
on
foot
,
*NL*
alone
,
through
the
night
,
weary
,
feverish
,
with
sad
and
troubled
eyes
,
*NL*
stunned
by
the
noise
and
dust
of
the
merry
wagons
filled
with
singing
*NL*
creatures
on
their
way
home
from
the
feast
,
which
passed
close
to
*NL*
him
,
as
he
,
in
his
discouragement
,
breathed
in
the
acrid
scent
of
the
*NL*
walnut-trees
,
along
the
road
,
in
order
to
refresh
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
to
living
more
and
more
alone
,
utterly
overwhelmed
,
wholly
given
*NL*
up
to
his
inward
anguish
,
going
and
coming
in
his
pain
like
the
wolf
in
*NL*
the
trap
,
seeking
the
absent
one
everywhere
,
stupefied
by
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
,
he
had
an
encounter
which
produced
on
him
a
*NL*
singular
effect
.
He
met
,
in
the
narrow
streets
in
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
Boulevard
des
Invalides
,
a
man
dressed
like
a
workingman
and
wearing
a
*NL*
cap
with
a
long
visor
,
which
allowed
a
glimpse
of
locks
of
very
*NL*
white
hair
.
Marius
was
struck
with
the
beauty
of
this
white
hair
,
and
*NL*
scrutinized
the
man
,
who
was
walking
slowly
and
as
though
absorbed
in
*NL*
painful
meditation
.
Strange
to
say
,
he
thought
that
he
recognized
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
.
The
hair
was
the
same
,
also
the
profile
,
so
far
as
the
cap
*NL*
permitted
a
view
of
it
,
the
mien
identical
,
only
more
depressed
.
But
why
*NL*
these
workingman
's
clothes
?
What
was
the
meaning
of
this
?
What
signified
*NL*
that
disguise
?
Marius
was
greatly
astonished
.
When
he
recovered
himself
,
*NL*
his
first
impulse
was
to
follow
the
man
;
who
knows
whether
he
did
not
*NL*
hold
at
last
the
clue
which
he
was
seeking
?
In
any
case
,
he
must
see
the
*NL*
man
near
at
hand
,
and
clear
up
the
mystery
.
But
the
idea
occurred
to
him
*NL*
too
late
,
the
man
was
no
longer
there
.
He
had
turned
into
some
little
*NL*
side
street
,
and
Marius
could
not
find
him
.
This
encounter
occupied
*NL*
his
mind
for
three
days
and
then
was
effaced
.
``
After
all
,
''
he
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
``
it
was
probably
only
a
resemblance
.

CHAPTER
II
--
TREASURE
TROVE
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
not
left
the
Gorbeau
house
.
He
paid
no
attention
to
any
one
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
to
tell
the
truth
,
there
were
no
other
inhabitants
in
the
*NL*
house
,
except
himself
and
those
Jondrettes
whose
rent
he
had
once
paid
,
*NL*
without
,
moreover
,
ever
having
spoken
to
either
father
,
mother
,
or
*NL*
daughters
.
The
other
lodgers
had
moved
away
or
had
died
,
or
had
been
*NL*
turned
out
in
default
of
payment
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
during
that
winter
,
the
sun
had
shown
itself
a
little
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
but
it
was
the
2d
of
February
,
that
ancient
Candlemas
*NL*
day
whose
treacherous
sun
,
the
precursor
of
a
six
weeks
'
cold
spell
,
*NL*
inspired
Mathieu
Laensberg
with
these
two
lines
,
which
have
with
justice
*NL*
remained
classic
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Qu'il
luise
ou
qu'il
luiserne
,
*NL*
L'ours
rentre
dans
en
sa

Marius
had
just
emerged
from
his
:
night
was
falling
.
It
was
the
hour
for
*NL*
his
dinner
;
for
he
had
been
obliged
to
take
to
dining
again
,
alas
!
oh
,
*NL*
infirmities
of
ideal
passions
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
crossed
his
threshold
,
where
Ma'am
Bougon
was
sweeping
at
*NL*
the
moment
,
as
she
uttered
this
memorable
monologue
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
there
that
is
cheap
now
?
Everything
is
dear
.
There
is
nothing
*NL*
in
the
world
that
is
cheap
except
trouble
;
you
can
get
that
for
nothing
,
*NL*
the
trouble
of
the
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
slowly
ascended
the
boulevard
towards
the
barrier
,
in
order
to
*NL*
reach
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
.
He
was
walking
along
with
drooping
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
felt
some
one
elbow
him
in
the
dusk
;
he
wheeled
round
,
*NL*
and
saw
two
young
girls
clad
in
rags
,
the
one
tall
and
slim
,
the
other
a
*NL*
little
shorter
,
who
were
passing
rapidly
,
all
out
of
breath
,
in
terror
,
*NL*
and
with
the
appearance
of
fleeing
;
they
had
been
coming
to
meet
him
,
*NL*
had
not
seen
him
,
and
had
jostled
him
as
they
passed
.
Through
the
*NL*
twilight
,
Marius
could
distinguish
their
livid
faces
,
their
wild
heads
,
*NL*
their
dishevelled
hair
,
their
hideous
bonnets
,
their
ragged
petticoats
,
*NL*
and
their
bare
feet
.
They
were
talking
as
they
ran
.
The
taller
said
in
a
*NL*
very
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bobbies
have
come
.
They
came
near
nabbing
me
at
the
half-circle
.
''
*NL*
The
other
answered
:
``
I
saw
them
.
I
bolted
,
bolted
,
bolted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
this
repulsive
slang
,
Marius
understood
that
gendarmes
or
the
*NL*
police
had
come
near
apprehending
these
two
children
,
and
that
the
*NL*
latter
had
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
plunged
among
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
behind
him
,
and
there
*NL*
created
,
for
a
few
minutes
,
in
the
gloom
,
a
sort
of
vague
white
spot
,
*NL*
then
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
halted
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
about
to
pursue
his
way
,
when
his
eye
lighted
on
a
little
grayish
*NL*
package
lying
on
the
ground
at
his
feet
.
He
stooped
and
picked
it
up
.
It
*NL*
was
a
sort
of
envelope
which
appeared
to
contain
papers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
``
those
unhappy
girls
dropped
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
retraced
his
steps
,
he
called
,
he
did
not
find
them
;
he
reflected
*NL*
that
they
must
already
be
far
away
,
put
the
package
in
his
pocket
,
and
*NL*
went
off
to
dine
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
,
he
saw
in
an
alley
of
the
Rue
Mouffetard
,
a
child
's
coffin
,
*NL*
covered
with
a
black
cloth
resting
on
three
chairs
,
and
illuminated
by
a
*NL*
candle
.
The
two
girls
of
the
twilight
recurred
to
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
mothers
!
''
he
thought
.
``
There
is
one
thing
sadder
than
to
see
one
's
*NL*
children
die
;
it
is
to
see
them
leading
an
evil
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
those
shadows
which
had
varied
his
melancholy
vanished
from
his
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
he
fell
back
once
more
into
his
habitual
preoccupations
.
*NL*
He
fell
to
thinking
once
more
of
his
six
months
of
love
and
happiness
*NL*
in
the
open
air
and
the
broad
daylight
,
beneath
the
beautiful
trees
of
*NL*
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
gloomy
my
life
has
become
!
''
he
said
to
himself
.
``
Young
girls
are
*NL*
always
appearing
to
me
,
only
formerly
they
were
angels
and
now
they
are
*NL*
ghouls
.

CHAPTER
III
--
QUADRIFRONS
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
as
he
was
undressing
preparatory
to
going
to
bed
,
his
hand
*NL*
came
in
contact
,
in
the
pocket
of
his
coat
,
with
the
packet
which
he
*NL*
had
picked
up
on
the
boulevard
.
He
had
forgotten
it
.
He
thought
that
it
*NL*
would
be
well
to
open
it
,
and
that
this
package
might
possibly
contain
*NL*
the
address
of
the
young
girls
,
if
it
really
belonged
to
them
,
and
,
in
*NL*
any
case
,
the
information
necessary
to
a
restitution
to
the
person
who
*NL*
had
lost
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
envelope
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
sealed
and
contained
four
letters
,
also
unsealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
bore
addresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
four
exhaled
a
horrible
odor
of
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
was
addressed
:
``
To
Madame
,
Madame
la
Marquise
de
Grucheray
,
*NL*
the
place
opposite
the
Chamber
of
Deputies
,
No
.
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
said
to
himself
,
that
he
should
probably
find
in
it
the
*NL*
information
which
he
sought
,
and
that
,
moreover
,
the
letter
being
open
,
*NL*
it
was
probable
that
it
could
be
read
without
impropriety
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
conceived
as
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
la
Marquise
:
The
virtue
of
clemency
and
piety
is
that
which
most
*NL*
closely
unites
sosiety
.
Turn
your
Christian
spirit
and
cast
a
look
of
*NL*
compassion
on
this
unfortunate
Spanish
victim
of
loyalty
and
attachment
*NL*
to
the
sacred
cause
of
legitimacy
,
who
has
given
with
his
blood
,
*NL*
consecrated
his
fortune
,
evverything
,
to
defend
that
cause
,
and
to-day
*NL*
finds
himself
in
the
greatest
missery
.
He
doubts
not
that
your
honorable
*NL*
person
will
grant
succor
to
preserve
an
existence
exteremely
painful
for
*NL*
a
military
man
of
education
and
honor
full
of
wounds
,
counts
in
advance
*NL*
on
the
humanity
which
animates
you
and
on
the
interest
which
Madame
la
*NL*
Marquise
bears
to
a
nation
so
unfortunate
.
Their
prayer
will
not
be
in
*NL*
vain
,
and
their
gratitude
will
preserve
theirs
charming
souvenir
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
respectful
sentiments
,
with
which
I
have
the
honor
to
be
*NL*
Madame
,
*NL*
Don
Alvares
,
Spanish
Captain
*NL*
of
Cavalry
,
a
royalist
who
*NL*
has
take
refuge
in
France
,
*NL*
who
finds
himself
on
travells
*NL*
for
his
country
,
and
the
*NL*
resources
are
lacking
him
to
*NL*
continue
his
travells
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
address
was
joined
to
the
signature
.
Marius
hoped
to
find
the
address
*NL*
in
the
second
letter
,
whose
superscription
read
:
A
Madame
,
Madame
la
*NL*
Comtesse
de
Montvernet
,
Rue
Cassette
,
No.
9
.
This
is
what
Marius
read
in
*NL*
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
la
Comtesse
:
It
is
an
unhappy
mother
of
a
family
of
six
*NL*
children
the
last
of
which
is
only
eight
months
old
.
I
sick
*NL*
since
my
last
confinement
,
abandoned
by
my
husband
five
months
ago
,
*NL*
haveing
no
resources
in
the
world
the
most
frightful
indigance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hope
of
Madame
la
Comtesse
,
she
has
the
honor
to
be
,
*NL*
Madame
,
with
profound
respect
,
*NL*
Mistress
Balizard
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
turned
to
the
third
letter
,
which
was
a
petition
like
the
*NL*
preceding
;
he
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Pabourgeot
,
Elector
,
wholesale
stocking
merchant
,
*NL*
Rue
Saint-Denis
on
the
corner
of
the
Rue
aux
Fers
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
permit
myself
to
address
you
this
letter
to
beg
you
to
grant
me
*NL*
the
pretious
favor
of
your
simpaties
and
to
interest
yourself
in
a
man
*NL*
of
letters
who
has
just
sent
a
drama
to
the
Theatre-Francais
.
The
subject
*NL*
is
historical
,
and
the
action
takes
place
in
Auvergne
in
the
time
*NL*
of
the
Empire
;
the
style
,
I
think
,
is
natural
,
laconic
,
and
may
have
*NL*
some
merit
.
There
are
couplets
to
be
sung
in
four
places
.
The
comic
,
*NL*
the
serious
,
the
unexpected
,
are
mingled
in
a
variety
of
characters
,
*NL*
and
a
tinge
of
romanticism
lightly
spread
through
all
the
intrigue
*NL*
which
proceeds
misteriously
,
and
ends
,
after
striking
altarations
,
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
many
beautiful
strokes
of
brilliant
scenes
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
principal
object
is
to
satisfi
the
desire
which
progressively
*NL*
animates
the
man
of
our
century
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
fashion
,
*NL*
that
capritious
and
bizarre
weathervane
which
changes
at
almost
*NL*
every
new
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
these
qualities
I
have
reason
to
fear
that
jealousy
,
*NL*
the
egotism
of
priviliged
authors
,
may
obtaine
my
exclusion
from
*NL*
the
theatre
,
for
I
am
not
ignorant
of
the
mortifications
with
which
*NL*
new-comers
are
treated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Monsiuer
Pabourgeot
,
your
just
reputation
as
an
enlightened
protector
*NL*
of
men
of
litters
emboldens
me
to
send
you
my
daughter
who
will
*NL*
explain
our
indigant
situation
to
you
,
lacking
bread
and
fire
*NL*
in
this
wynter
season
.
When
I
say
to
you
that
I
beg
you
to
accept
*NL*
the
dedication
of
my
drama
which
I
desire
to
make
to
you
and
of
all
*NL*
those
that
I
shall
make
,
is
to
prove
to
you
how
great
is
my
ambition
*NL*
to
have
the
honor
of
sheltering
myself
under
your
protection
,
*NL*
and
of
adorning
my
writings
with
your
name
.
If
you
deign
to
honor
*NL*
me
with
the
most
modest
offering
,
I
shall
immediately
occupy
myself
*NL*
in
making
a
piesse
of
verse
to
pay
you
my
tribute
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
Which
I
shall
endeavor
to
render
this
piesse
as
perfect
as
possible
,
*NL*
will
be
sent
to
you
before
it
is
inserted
at
the
beginning
of
the
*NL*
drama
and
delivered
on
the
stage
.
*NL*
To
Monsieur
*NL*
and
Madame
Pabourgeot
,
*NL*
My
most
respectful
complements
,
*NL*
Genflot
,
man
of
letters
.
*NL*
P.
S.
Even
if
it
is
only
forty
sous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excuse
me
for
sending
my
daughter
and
not
presenting
myself
,
*NL*
but
sad
motives
connected
with
the
toilet
do
not
permit
me
,
*NL*
alas
!
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
Marius
opened
the
fourth
letter
.
The
address
ran
:
To
the
*NL*
benevolent
Gentleman
of
the
church
of
Saint-Jacquesdu-haut-Pas
.
It
*NL*
contained
the
following
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Benevolent
Man
:
If
you
deign
to
accompany
my
daughter
,
you
will
*NL*
behold
a
misserable
calamity
,
and
I
will
show
you
my
certificates
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
aspect
of
these
writings
your
generous
soul
will
be
moved
*NL*
with
a
sentiment
of
obvious
benevolence
,
for
true
philosophers
*NL*
always
feel
lively
emotions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Admit
,
compassionate
man
,
that
it
is
necessary
to
suffer
the
most
*NL*
cruel
need
,
and
that
it
is
very
painful
,
for
the
sake
of
obtaining
*NL*
a
little
relief
,
to
get
oneself
attested
by
the
authorities
as
though
*NL*
one
were
not
free
to
suffer
and
to
die
of
inanition
while
waiting
*NL*
to
have
our
misery
relieved
.
Destinies
are
very
fatal
for
several
*NL*
and
too
prodigal
or
too
protecting
for
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
await
your
presence
or
your
offering
,
if
you
deign
to
make
one
,
*NL*
and
I
beseech
you
to
accept
the
respectful
sentiments
with
which
I
*NL*
have
the
honor
to
be
,
*NL*
truly
magnanimous
man
,
*NL*
your
very
humble
*NL*
and
very
obedient
servant
,
*NL*
P.
Fabantou
,
dramatic
artist
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
perusing
these
four
letters
,
Marius
did
not
find
himself
much
*NL*
further
advanced
than
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
not
one
of
the
signers
gave
his
address
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
they
seemed
to
come
from
four
different
individuals
,
Don
Alveras
,
*NL*
Mistress
Balizard
,
the
poet
Genflot
,
and
dramatic
artist
Fabantou
;
but
*NL*
the
singular
thing
about
these
letters
was
,
that
all
four
were
written
*NL*
by
the
same
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
conclusion
was
to
be
drawn
from
this
,
except
that
they
all
come
*NL*
from
the
same
person
?
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
and
this
rendered
the
conjecture
all
the
more
probable
,
the
*NL*
coarse
and
yellow
paper
was
the
same
in
all
four
,
the
odor
of
tobacco
*NL*
was
the
same
,
and
,
although
an
attempt
had
been
made
to
vary
the
*NL*
style
,
the
same
orthographical
faults
were
reproduced
with
the
greatest
*NL*
tranquillity
,
and
the
man
of
letters
Genflot
was
no
more
exempt
from
*NL*
them
than
the
Spanish
captain
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
waste
of
trouble
to
try
to
solve
this
petty
mystery
.
Had
it
not
*NL*
been
a
chance
find
,
it
would
have
borne
the
air
of
a
mystification
.
*NL*
Marius
was
too
melancholy
to
take
even
a
chance
pleasantry
well
,
and
to
*NL*
lend
himself
to
a
game
which
the
pavement
of
the
street
seemed
desirous
*NL*
of
playing
with
him
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
playing
the
part
of
*NL*
the
blind
man
in
blind
man
's
buff
between
the
four
letters
,
and
that
*NL*
they
were
making
sport
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
,
however
,
indicated
that
these
letters
belonged
to
the
two
*NL*
young
girls
whom
Marius
had
met
on
the
boulevard
.
After
all
,
they
were
*NL*
evidently
papers
of
no
value
.
Marius
replaced
them
in
their
envelope
,
*NL*
flung
the
whole
into
a
corner
and
went
to
bed
.
About
seven
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
he
had
just
risen
and
breakfasted
,
and
was
trying
to
settle
*NL*
down
to
work
,
when
there
came
a
soft
knock
at
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
owned
nothing
,
he
never
locked
his
door
,
unless
occasionally
,
*NL*
though
very
rarely
,
when
he
was
engaged
in
some
pressing
work
.
Even
when
*NL*
absent
he
left
his
key
in
the
lock
.
``
You
will
be
robbed
,
''
said
Ma'am
*NL*
Bougon
.
``
Of
what
?
''
said
Marius
.
The
truth
is
,
however
,
that
he
had
,
one
*NL*
day
,
been
robbed
of
an
old
pair
of
boots
,
to
the
great
triumph
of
Ma'am
*NL*
Bougon
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
second
knock
,
as
gentle
as
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
,
Ma'am
Bougon
?
''
asked
Marius
,
without
raising
his
eyes
*NL*
from
the
books
and
manuscripts
on
his
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
which
did
not
belong
to
Ma'am
Bougon
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
sir
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
dull
,
broken
,
hoarse
,
strangled
voice
,
the
voice
of
an
old
man
,
*NL*
roughened
with
brandy
and
liquor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
turned
round
hastily
,
and
beheld
a
young
girl
.

CHAPTER

A
ROSE
IN
MISERY

*NL*
*NL*
A
very
young
girl
was
standing
in
the
half-open
door
.
The
dormer
window
*NL*
of
the
garret
,
through
which
the
light
fell
,
was
precisely
opposite
*NL*
the
door
,
and
illuminated
the
figure
with
a
wan
light
.
She
was
a
frail
,
*NL*
emaciated
,
slender
creature
;
there
was
nothing
but
a
chemise
and
a
*NL*
petticoat
upon
that
chilled
and
shivering
nakedness
.
Her
girdle
was
a
*NL*
string
,
her
head
ribbon
a
string
,
her
pointed
shoulders
emerged
from
her
*NL*
chemise
,
a
blond
and
lymphatic
pallor
,
earth-colored
collar-bones
,
red
*NL*
hands
,
a
half-open
and
degraded
mouth
,
missing
teeth
,
dull
,
bold
,
base
*NL*
eyes
;
she
had
the
form
of
a
young
girl
who
has
missed
her
youth
,
and
the
*NL*
look
of
a
corrupt
old
woman
;
fifty
years
mingled
with
fifteen
;
one
of
*NL*
those
beings
which
are
both
feeble
and
horrible
,
and
which
cause
those
*NL*
to
shudder
whom
they
do
not
cause
to
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
risen
,
and
was
staring
in
a
sort
of
stupor
at
this
being
,
who
*NL*
was
almost
like
the
forms
of
the
shadows
which
traverse
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
heart-breaking
thing
of
all
was
,
that
this
young
girl
had
not
*NL*
come
into
the
world
to
be
homely
.
In
her
early
childhood
she
must
even
*NL*
have
been
pretty
.
The
grace
of
her
age
was
still
struggling
against
the
*NL*
hideous
,
premature
decrepitude
of
debauchery
and
poverty
.
The
remains
of
*NL*
beauty
were
dying
away
in
that
face
of
sixteen
,
like
the
pale
sunlight
*NL*
which
is
extinguished
under
hideous
clouds
at
dawn
on
a
winter
's
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
face
was
not
wholly
unknown
to
Marius
.
He
thought
he
remembered
*NL*
having
seen
it
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
wish
,
Mademoiselle
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
replied
in
her
voice
of
a
drunken
convict
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
letter
for
you
,
Monsieur
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
called
Marius
by
his
name
;
he
could
not
doubt
that
he
was
the
person
*NL*
whom
she
wanted
;
but
who
was
this
girl
?
How
did
she
know
his
name
?
*NL*
*NL*
Without
waiting
for
him
to
tell
her
to
advance
,
she
entered
.
She
entered
*NL*
resolutely
,
staring
,
with
a
sort
of
assurance
that
made
the
heart
bleed
,
*NL*
at
the
whole
room
and
the
unmade
bed
.
Her
feet
were
bare
.
Large
holes
*NL*
in
her
petticoat
permitted
glimpses
of
her
long
legs
and
her
thin
knees
.
*NL*
She
was
shivering
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
a
letter
in
her
hand
,
which
she
presented
to
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
as
he
opened
the
letter
,
noticed
that
the
enormous
wafer
which
*NL*
sealed
it
was
still
moist
.
The
message
could
not
have
come
from
a
*NL*
distance
.
He
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
My
amiable
neighbor
,
young
man
:
I
have
learned
of
your
goodness
to
me
,
*NL*
that
you
paid
my
rent
six
months
ago
.
I
bless
you
,
young
man
.
*NL*
My
eldest
daughter
will
tell
you
that
we
have
been
without
a
morsel
*NL*
of
bread
for
two
days
,
four
persons
and
my
spouse
ill
.
If
I
am
*NL*
not
deseaved
in
my
opinion
,
I
think
I
may
hope
that
your
generous
*NL*
heart
will
melt
at
this
statement
and
the
desire
will
subjugate
you
*NL*
to
be
propitious
to
me
by
daigning
to
lavish
on
me
a
slight
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
with
the
distinguished
consideration
which
is
due
to
the
*NL*
benefactors
of
humanity
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
P.S.
My
eldest
daughter
will
await
your
orders
,
dear
Monsieur
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
,
coming
in
the
very
midst
of
the
mysterious
adventure
which
*NL*
had
occupied
Marius
'
thoughts
ever
since
the
preceding
evening
,
was
like
*NL*
a
candle
in
a
cellar
.
All
was
suddenly
illuminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
letter
came
from
the
same
place
as
the
other
four
.
There
was
the
*NL*
same
writing
,
the
same
style
,
the
same
orthography
,
the
same
paper
,
the
*NL*
same
odor
of
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
five
missives
,
five
histories
,
five
signatures
,
and
a
single
*NL*
signer
.
The
Spanish
Captain
Don
Alvares
,
the
unhappy
Mistress
Balizard
,
*NL*
the
dramatic
poet
Genflot
,
the
old
comedian
Fabantou
,
were
all
four
*NL*
named
Jondrette
,
if
,
indeed
,
Jondrette
himself
were
named
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
lived
in
the
house
for
a
tolerably
long
time
,
and
he
had
had
,
*NL*
as
we
have
said
,
but
very
rare
occasion
to
see
,
to
even
catch
a
glimpse
*NL*
of
,
his
extremely
mean
neighbors
.
His
mind
was
elsewhere
,
and
where
the
*NL*
mind
is
,
there
the
eyes
are
also
.
He
had
been
obliged
more
than
once
to
*NL*
pass
the
Jondrettes
in
the
corridor
or
on
the
stairs
;
but
they
were
mere
*NL*
forms
to
him
;
he
had
paid
so
little
heed
to
them
,
that
,
on
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
,
he
had
jostled
the
Jondrette
girls
on
the
boulevard
,
without
*NL*
recognizing
them
,
for
it
had
evidently
been
they
,
and
it
was
with
great
*NL*
difficulty
that
the
one
who
had
just
entered
his
room
had
awakened
in
*NL*
him
,
in
spite
of
disgust
and
pity
,
a
vague
recollection
of
having
met
*NL*
her
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
he
saw
everything
clearly
.
He
understood
that
his
neighbor
*NL*
Jondrette
,
in
his
distress
,
exercised
the
industry
of
speculating
on
the
*NL*
charity
of
benevolent
persons
,
that
he
procured
addresses
,
and
that
he
*NL*
wrote
under
feigned
names
to
people
whom
he
judged
to
be
wealthy
and
*NL*
compassionate
,
letters
which
his
daughters
delivered
at
their
risk
*NL*
and
peril
,
for
this
father
had
come
to
such
a
pass
,
that
he
risked
his
*NL*
daughters
;
he
was
playing
a
game
with
fate
,
and
he
used
them
as
the
*NL*
stake
.
Marius
understood
that
probably
,
judging
from
their
flight
on
the
*NL*
evening
before
,
from
their
breathless
condition
,
from
their
terror
*NL*
and
from
the
words
of
slang
which
he
had
overheard
,
these
unfortunate
*NL*
creatures
were
plying
some
inexplicably
sad
profession
,
and
that
the
*NL*
result
of
the
whole
was
,
in
the
midst
of
human
society
,
as
it
is
now
*NL*
constituted
,
two
miserable
beings
who
were
neither
girls
nor
women
,
a
*NL*
species
of
impure
and
innocent
monsters
produced
by
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sad
creatures
,
without
name
,
or
sex
,
or
age
,
to
whom
neither
good
nor
*NL*
evil
were
any
longer
possible
,
and
who
,
on
emerging
from
childhood
,
*NL*
have
already
nothing
in
this
world
,
neither
liberty
,
nor
virtue
,
nor
*NL*
responsibility
.
Souls
which
blossomed
out
yesterday
,
and
are
faded
*NL*
to-day
,
like
those
flowers
let
fall
in
the
streets
,
which
are
soiled
*NL*
with
every
sort
of
mire
,
while
waiting
for
some
wheel
to
crush
them
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
while
Marius
bent
a
pained
and
astonished
gaze
on
her
,
the
*NL*
young
girl
was
wandering
back
and
forth
in
the
garret
with
the
audacity
*NL*
of
a
spectre
.
She
kicked
about
,
without
troubling
herself
as
to
her
*NL*
nakedness
.
Occasionally
her
chemise
,
which
was
untied
and
torn
,
fell
*NL*
almost
to
her
waist
.
She
moved
the
chairs
about
,
she
disarranged
the
*NL*
toilet
articles
which
stood
on
the
commode
,
she
handled
Marius
'
clothes
,
*NL*
she
rummaged
about
to
see
what
there
was
in
the
corners
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
''
said
she
,
``
you
have
a
mirror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
hummed
scraps
of
vaudevilles
,
as
though
she
had
been
alone
,
*NL*
frolicsome
refrains
which
her
hoarse
and
guttural
voice
rendered
*NL*
lugubrious
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
indescribable
constraint
,
weariness
,
and
humiliation
were
perceptible
*NL*
beneath
this
hardihood
.
Effrontery
is
a
disgrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
melancholy
than
to
see
her
sport
about
the
room
,
*NL*
and
,
so
to
speak
,
flit
with
the
movements
of
a
bird
which
is
frightened
*NL*
by
the
daylight
,
or
which
has
broken
its
wing
.
One
felt
that
under
other
*NL*
conditions
of
education
and
destiny
,
the
gay
and
over-free
mien
of
this
*NL*
young
girl
might
have
turned
out
sweet
and
charming
.
Never
,
even
among
*NL*
animals
,
does
the
creature
born
to
be
a
dove
change
into
an
osprey
.
That
*NL*
is
only
to
be
seen
among
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
reflected
,
and
allowed
her
to
have
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
she
,
``
books
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
pierced
her
glassy
eye
.
She
resumed
,
and
her
accent
expressed
*NL*
the
happiness
which
she
felt
in
boasting
of
something
,
to
which
no
human
*NL*
creature
is
insensible
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
how
to
read
,
I
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
eagerly
seized
a
book
which
lay
open
on
the
table
,
and
read
with
*NL*
tolerable
fluency
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
General
Bauduin
received
orders
to
take
the
chateau
of
Hougomont
*NL*
which
stands
in
the
middle
of
the
plain
of
Waterloo
,
with
five
*NL*
battalions
of
his
brigade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Waterloo
!
I
know
about
that
.
It
was
a
battle
long
ago
.
My
father
*NL*
was
there
.
My
father
has
served
in
the
armies
.
We
are
fine
Bonapartists
*NL*
in
our
house
,
that
we
are
!
Waterloo
was
against
the
English
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laid
down
the
book
,
caught
up
a
pen
,
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
know
how
to
write
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dipped
her
pen
in
the
ink
,
and
turning
to
Marius
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
see
?
Look
here
,
I
'm
going
to
write
a
word
to
show
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
before
he
had
time
to
answer
,
she
wrote
on
a
sheet
of
white
paper
,
*NL*
which
lay
in
the
middle
of
the
table
:
``
The
bobbies
are
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
throwing
down
the
pen
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
no
faults
of
orthography
.
You
can
look
.
We
have
received
an
*NL*
education
,
my
sister
and
I
.
We
have
not
always
been
as
we
are
now
.
We
*NL*
were
not
made
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
paused
,
fixed
her
dull
eyes
on
Marius
,
and
burst
out
laughing
,
*NL*
saying
,
with
an
intonation
which
contained
every
form
of
anguish
,
*NL*
stifled
by
every
form
of
cynicism
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
began
to
hum
these
words
to
a
gay
air
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
J'ai
faim
,
mon
pere
.
''
I
am
hungry
,
father
.
*NL*
Pas
de

.
I
have
no
food
.
*NL*
J'ai

.
I
am
cold
,
mother
.
*NL*
Pas
de

.
I
have
no
clothes
.
*NL*
Grelotte
,
Lolotte
!
*NL*
Lolotte
!
Shiver
,
*NL*
Sanglote
,
Sob
,
*NL*
Jacquot
!
''
Jacquot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
hardly
finished
this
couplet
,
when
she
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ever
go
to
the
play
,
Monsieur
Marius
?
I
do
.
I
have
a
little
*NL*
brother
who
is
a
friend
of
the
artists
,
and
who
gives
me
tickets
*NL*
sometimes
.
But
I
do
n't
like
the
benches
in
the
galleries
.
One
is
cramped
*NL*
and
uncomfortable
there
.
There
are
rough
people
there
sometimes
;
and
*NL*
people
who
smell
bad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
scrutinized
Marius
,
assumed
a
singular
air
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
Mr.
Marius
,
that
you
are
a
very
handsome
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
the
same
moment
the
same
idea
occurred
to
them
both
,
and
made
*NL*
her
smile
and
him
blush
.
She
stepped
up
to
him
,
and
laid
her
hand
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
:
``
You
pay
no
heed
to
me
,
but
I
know
you
,
Mr.
Marius
.
I
meet
you
*NL*
here
on
the
staircase
,
and
then
I
often
see
you
going
to
a
person
named
*NL*
Father
Mabeuf
who
lives
in
the
direction
of
Austerlitz
,
sometimes
when
I
*NL*
have
been
strolling
in
that
quarter
.
It
is
very
becoming
to
you
to
have
*NL*
your
hair
tumbled
thus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
render
her
voice
soft
,
but
only
succeeded
in
making
it
very
*NL*
deep
.
A
portion
of
her
words
was
lost
in
the
transit
from
her
larynx
to
*NL*
her
lips
,
as
though
on
a
piano
where
some
notes
are
missing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
retreated
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
,
''
said
he
,
with
his
cool
gravity
,
``
I
have
here
a
package
*NL*
which
belongs
to
you
,
I
think
.
Permit
me
to
return
it
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
held
out
the
envelope
containing
the
four
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
clapped
her
hands
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
looking
everywhere
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
eagerly
seized
the
package
and
opened
the
envelope
,
saying
as
*NL*
she
did
so
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dieu
de
Dieu
!
how
my
sister
and
I
have
hunted
!
And
it
was
you
who
found
*NL*
it
!
On
the
boulevard
,
was
it
not
?
It
must
have
been
on
the
boulevard
?
*NL*
You
see
,
we
let
it
fall
when
we
were
running
.
It
was
that
brat
of
a
*NL*
sister
of
mine
who
was
so
stupid
.
When
we
got
home
,
we
could
not
find
it
*NL*
anywhere
.
As
we
did
not
wish
to
be
beaten
,
as
that
is
useless
,
as
that
*NL*
is
entirely
useless
,
as
that
is
absolutely
useless
,
we
said
that
we
had
*NL*
carried
the
letters
to
the
proper
persons
,
and
that
they
had
said
to
us
:
*NL*
`
Nix
.
'
So
here
they
are
,
those
poor
letters
!
And
how
did
you
find
out
*NL*
that
they
belonged
to
me
?
Ah
!
yes
,
the
writing
.
So
it
was
you
that
we
*NL*
jostled
as
we
passed
last
night
.
We
could
n't
see
.
I
said
to
my
sister
:
*NL*
`
Is
it
a
gentleman
?
'
My
sister
said
to
me
:
'
I
think
it
is
a
gentleman
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
she
had
unfolded
the
petition
addressed
to
``
the
*NL*
benevolent
gentleman
of
the
church
of
Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!
''
said
she
,
``
this
is
for
that
old
fellow
who
goes
to
mass
.
By
the
*NL*
way
,
this
is
his
hour
.
I
'll
go
and
carry
it
to
him
.
Perhaps
he
will
give
*NL*
us
something
to
breakfast
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
began
to
laugh
again
,
and
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
it
will
mean
if
we
get
a
breakfast
today
?
It
will
mean
*NL*
that
we
shall
have
had
our
breakfast
of
the
day
before
yesterday
,
our
*NL*
breakfast
of
yesterday
,
our
dinner
of
to-day
,
and
all
that
at
once
,
and
*NL*
this
morning
.
Come
!
Parbleu
!
if
you
are
not
satisfied
,
dogs
,
burst
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reminded
Marius
of
the
wretched
girl
's
errand
to
himself
.
He
*NL*
fumbled
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
found
nothing
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
went
on
,
and
seemed
to
have
no
consciousness
of
Marius
'
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
often
go
off
in
the
evening
.
Sometimes
I
do
n't
come
home
again
.
Last
*NL*
winter
,
before
we
came
here
,
we
lived
under
the
arches
of
the
bridges
.
*NL*
We
huddled
together
to
keep
from
freezing
.
My
little
sister
cried
.
How
*NL*
melancholy
the
water
is
!
When
I
thought
of
drowning
myself
,
I
said
*NL*
to
myself
:
`
No
,
it
's
too
cold
.
'
I
go
out
alone
,
whenever
I
choose
,
I
*NL*
sometimes
sleep
in
the
ditches
.
Do
you
know
,
at
night
,
when
I
walk
along
*NL*
the
boulevard
,
I
see
the
trees
like
forks
,
I
see
houses
,
all
black
and
*NL*
as
big
as
Notre
Dame
,
I
fancy
that
the
white
walls
are
the
river
,
I
say
*NL*
to
myself
:
`
Why
,
there
's
water
there
!
'
The
stars
are
like
the
lamps
in
*NL*
illuminations
,
one
would
say
that
they
smoked
and
that
the
wind
blew
*NL*
them
out
,
I
am
bewildered
,
as
though
horses
were
breathing
in
my
ears
;
*NL*
although
it
is
night
,
I
hear
hand-organs
and
spinning-machines
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
all
.
I
think
people
are
flinging
stones
at
me
,
I
flee
*NL*
without
knowing
whither
,
everything
whirls
and
whirls
.
You
feel
very
*NL*
queer
when
you
have
had
no
food
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
she
stared
at
him
with
a
bewildered
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
searching
and
ransacking
his
pockets
,
Marius
had
finally
*NL*
collected
five
francs
sixteen
sous
.
This
was
all
he
owned
in
the
world
*NL*
for
the
moment
.
``
At
all
events
,
''
he
thought
,
``
there
is
my
dinner
for
*NL*
to-day
,
and
to-morrow
we
will
see
.
''
He
kept
the
sixteen
sous
,
and
handed
*NL*
the
five
francs
to
the
young
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seized
the
coin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
''
said
she
,
``
the
sun
is
shining
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
as
though
the
sun
had
possessed
the
property
of
melting
the
*NL*
avalanches
of
slang
in
her
brain
,
she
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
francs
!
the
shiner
!
a
monarch
!
in
this
hole
!
Ai
n't
this
fine
!
*NL*
You
're
a
jolly
thief
!
I
'm
your
humble
servant
!
Bravo
for
the
good
*NL*
fellows
!
Two
days

wine
!
and
meat
!
and
stew
!
we
'll
have
a
royal
feast
!
*NL*
and
a
good
fill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pulled
her
chemise
up
on
her
shoulders
,
made
a
low
bow
to
Marius
,
*NL*
then
a
familiar
sign
with
her
hand
,
and
went
towards
the
door
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
sir
.
It
's
all
right
.
I
'll
go
and
find
my
old
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
passed
,
she
caught
sight
of
a
dry
crust
of
bread
on
the
commode
,
*NL*
which
was
moulding
there
amid
the
dust
;
she
flung
herself
upon
it
and
*NL*
bit
into
it
,
muttering
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
!
it
's
hard
!
it
breaks
my
teeth

Then
she
departed

CHAPTER
V
--
A
PROVIDENTIAL
PEEP-HOLE
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
lived
for
five
years
in
poverty
,
in
destitution
,
even
in
*NL*
distress
,
but
he
now
perceived
that
he
had
not
known
real
misery
.
True
*NL*
misery
he
had
but
just
had
a
view
of
.
It
was
its
spectre
which
had
just
*NL*
passed
before
his
eyes
.
In
fact
,
he
who
has
only
beheld
the
misery
of
*NL*
man
has
seen
nothing
;
the
misery
of
woman
is
what
he
must
see
;
he
who
*NL*
has
seen
only
the
misery
of
woman
has
seen
nothing
;
he
must
see
the
*NL*
misery
of
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
has
reached
his
last
extremity
,
he
has
reached
his
last
*NL*
resources
at
the
same
time
.
Woe
to
the
defenceless
beings
who
surround
*NL*
him
!
Work
,
wages
,
bread
,
fire
,
courage
,
good
will
,
all
fail
him
*NL*
simultaneously
.
The
light
of
day
seems
extinguished
without
,
the
moral
*NL*
light
within
;
in
these
shadows
man
encounters
the
feebleness
of
the
*NL*
woman
and
the
child
,
and
bends
them
violently
to
ignominy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
all
horrors
become
possible
.
Despair
is
surrounded
with
fragile
*NL*
partitions
which
all
open
on
either
vice
or
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
Health
,
youth
,
honor
,
all
the
shy
delicacies
of
the
young
body
,
the
*NL*
heart
,
virginity
,
modesty
,
that
epidermis
of
the
soul
,
are
manipulated
*NL*
in
sinister
wise
by
that
fumbling
which
seeks
resources
,
which
*NL*
encounters
opprobrium
,
and
which
accommodates
itself
to
it
.
Fathers
,
*NL*
mothers
,
children
,
brothers
,
sisters
,
men
,
women
,
daughters
,
adhere
*NL*
and
become
incorporated
,
almost
like
a
mineral
formation
,
in
that
dusky
*NL*
promiscuousness
of
sexes
,
relationships
,
ages
,
infamies
,
and
innocences
.
*NL*
They
crouch
,
back
to
back
,
in
a
sort
of
hut
of
fate
.
They
exchange
*NL*
woe-begone
glances
.
Oh
,
the
unfortunate
wretches
!
How
pale
they
are
!
How
*NL*
cold
they
are
!
It
seems
as
though
they
dwelt
in
a
planet
much
further
*NL*
from
the
sun
than
ours
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
young
girl
was
to
Marius
a
sort
of
messenger
from
the
realm
of
sad
*NL*
shadows
.
She
revealed
to
him
a
hideous
side
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
almost
reproached
himself
for
the
preoccupations
of
revery
and
*NL*
passion
which
had
prevented
his
bestowing
a
glance
on
his
neighbors
up
*NL*
to
that
day
.
The
payment
of
their
rent
had
been
a
mechanical
movement
,
*NL*
which
any
one
would
have
yielded
to
;
but
he
,
Marius
,
should
have
done
*NL*
better
than
that
.
What
!
only
a
wall
separated
him
from
those
abandoned
*NL*
beings
who
lived
gropingly
in
the
dark
outside
the
pale
of
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
world
,
he
was
elbow
to
elbow
with
them
,
he
was
,
in
some
sort
,
the
*NL*
last
link
of
the
human
race
which
they
touched
,
he
heard
them
live
,
or
*NL*
rather
,
rattle
in
the
death
agony
beside
him
,
and
he
paid
no
heed
to
*NL*
them
!
Every
day
,
every
instant
,
he
heard
them
walking
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
wall
,
he
heard
them
go
,
and
come
,
and
speak
,
and
he
did
not
even
*NL*
lend
an
ear
!
And
groans
lay
in
those
words
,
and
he
did
not
even
listen
*NL*
to
them
,
his
thoughts
were
elsewhere
,
given
up
to
dreams
,
to
impossible
*NL*
radiances
,
to
loves
in
the
air
,
to
follies
;
and
all
the
while
,
human
*NL*
creatures
,
his
brothers
in
Jesus
Christ
,
his
brothers
in
the
people
,
*NL*
were
agonizing
in
vain
beside
him
!
He
even
formed
a
part
of
their
*NL*
misfortune
,
and
he
aggravated
it
.
For
if
they
had
had
another
neighbor
*NL*
who
was
less
chimerical
and
more
attentive
,
any
ordinary
and
charitable
*NL*
man
,
evidently
their
indigence
would
have
been
noticed
,
their
signals
of
*NL*
distress
would
have
been
perceived
,
and
they
would
have
been
taken
hold
*NL*
of
and
rescued
!
They
appeared
very
corrupt
and
very
depraved
,
no
*NL*
doubt
,
very
vile
,
very
odious
even
;
but
those
who
fall
without
becoming
*NL*
degraded
are
rare
;
besides
,
there
is
a
point
where
the
unfortunate
and
*NL*
the
infamous
unite
and
are
confounded
in
a
single
word
,
a
fatal
word
,
*NL*
the
miserable
;
whose
fault
is
this
?
And
then
should
not
the
charity
be
*NL*
all
the
more
profound
,
in
proportion
as
the
fall
is
great
?
*NL*
*NL*
While
reading
himself
this
moral
lesson
,
for
there
were
occasions
on
*NL*
which
Marius
,
like
all
truly
honest
hearts
,
was
his
own
pedagogue
and
*NL*
scolded
himself
more
than
he
deserved
,
he
stared
at
the
wall
which
*NL*
separated
him
from
the
Jondrettes
,
as
though
he
were
able
to
make
his
*NL*
gaze
,
full
of
pity
,
penetrate
that
partition
and
warm
these
wretched
*NL*
people
.
The
wall
was
a
thin
layer
of
plaster
upheld
by
lathes
and
beams
,
*NL*
and
,
as
the
reader
had
just
learned
,
it
allowed
the
sound
of
voices
and
*NL*
words
to
be
clearly
distinguished
.
Only
a
man
as
dreamy
as
Marius
could
*NL*
have
failed
to
perceive
this
long
before
.
There
was
no
paper
pasted
on
*NL*
the
wall
,
either
on
the
side
of
the
Jondrettes
or
on
that
of
Marius
;
the
*NL*
coarse
construction
was
visible
in
its
nakedness
.
Marius
examined
the
*NL*
partition
,
almost
unconsciously
;
sometimes
revery
examines
,
observes
,
*NL*
and
scrutinizes
as
thought
would
.
All
at
once
he
sprang
up
;
he
had
just
*NL*
perceived
,
near
the
top
,
close
to
the
ceiling
,
a
triangular
hole
,
which
*NL*
resulted
from
the
space
between
three
lathes
.
The
plaster
which
should
*NL*
have
filled
this
cavity
was
missing
,
and
by
mounting
on
the
commode
,
*NL*
a
view
could
be
had
through
this
aperture
into
the
Jondrettes
'
attic
.
*NL*
Commiseration
has
,
and
should
have
,
its
curiosity
.
This
aperture
formed
*NL*
a
sort
of
peep-hole
.
It
is
permissible
to
gaze
at
misfortune
like
a
*NL*
traitor
in
order
to
succor
it
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
WILD
MAN
IN
HIS
LAIR
*NL*
*NL*
Cities
,
like
forests
,
have
their
caverns
in
which
all
the
most
wicked
*NL*
and
formidable
creatures
which
they
contain
conceal
themselves
.
Only
,
*NL*
in
cities
,
that
which
thus
conceals
itself
is
ferocious
,
unclean
,
and
*NL*
petty
,
that
is
to
say
,
ugly
;
in
forests
,
that
which
conceals
itself
is
*NL*
ferocious
,
savage
,
and
grand
,
that
is
to
say
,
beautiful
.
Taking
one
lair
*NL*
with
another
,
the
beast
's
is
preferable
to
the
man
's
.
Caverns
are
better
*NL*
than
hovels
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Marius
now
beheld
was
a
hovel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
poor
,
and
his
chamber
was
poverty-stricken
,
but
as
his
*NL*
poverty
was
noble
,
his
garret
was
neat
.
The
den
upon
which
his
eye
now
*NL*
rested
was
abject
,
dirty
,
fetid
,
pestiferous
,
mean
,
sordid
.
The
only
*NL*
furniture
consisted
of
a
straw
chair
,
an
infirm
table
,
some
old
bits
of
*NL*
crockery
,
and
in
two
of
the
corners
,
two
indescribable
pallets
;
all
*NL*
the
light
was
furnished
by
a
dormer
window
of
four
panes
,
draped
with
*NL*
spiders
'
webs
.
Through
this
aperture
there
penetrated
just
enough
light
*NL*
to
make
the
face
of
a
man
appear
like
the
face
of
a
phantom
.
The
walls
*NL*
had
a
leprous
aspect
,
and
were
covered
with
seams
and
scars
,
like
a
*NL*
visage
disfigured
by
some
horrible
malady
;
a
repulsive
moisture
exuded
*NL*
from
them
.
Obscene
sketches
roughly
sketched
with
charcoal
could
be
*NL*
distinguished
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chamber
which
Marius
occupied
had
a
dilapidated
brick
pavement
;
this
*NL*
one
was
neither
tiled
nor
planked
;
its
inhabitants
stepped
directly
*NL*
on
the
antique
plaster
of
the
hovel
,
which
had
grown
black
under
the
*NL*
long-continued
pressure
of
feet
.
Upon
this
uneven
floor
,
where
the
dirt
*NL*
seemed
to
be
fairly
incrusted
,
and
which
possessed
but
one
virginity
,
*NL*
that
of
the
broom
,
were
capriciously
grouped
constellations
of
old
*NL*
shoes
,
socks
,
and
repulsive
rags
;
however
,
this
room
had
a
fireplace
,
*NL*
so
it
was
let
for
forty
francs
a
year
.
There
was
every
sort
of
thing
*NL*
in
that
fireplace
,
a
brazier
,
a
pot
,
broken
boards
,
rags
suspended
*NL*
from
nails
,
a
bird-cage
,
ashes
,
and
even
a
little
fire
.
Two
brands
were
*NL*
smouldering
there
in
a
melancholy
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
which
added
still
more
to
the
horrors
of
this
garret
was
,
that
*NL*
it
was
large
.
It
had
projections
and
angles
and
black
holes
,
the
lower
*NL*
sides
of
roofs
,
bays
,
and
promontories
.
Hence
horrible
,
unfathomable
*NL*
nooks
where
it
seemed
as
though
spiders
as
big
as
one
's
fist
,
wood-lice
*NL*
as
large
as
one
's
foot
,
and
perhaps
even
--
who
knows
?
--
some
monstrous
*NL*
human
beings
,
must
be
hiding
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
pallets
was
near
the
door
,
the
other
near
the
window
.
One
*NL*
end
of
each
touched
the
fireplace
and
faced
Marius
.
In
a
corner
near
the
*NL*
aperture
through
which
Marius
was
gazing
,
a
colored
engraving
in
a
black
*NL*
frame
was
suspended
to
a
nail
on
the
wall
,
and
at
its
bottom
,
in
large
*NL*
letters
,
was
the
inscription
:
THE
DREAM
.
This
represented
a
sleeping
*NL*
woman
,
and
a
child
,
also
asleep
,
the
child
on
the
woman
's
lap
,
an
eagle
*NL*
in
a
cloud
,
with
a
crown
in
his
beak
,
and
the
woman
thrusting
the
*NL*
crown
away
from
the
child
's
head
,
without
awaking
the
latter
;
in
the
*NL*
background
,
Napoleon
in
a
glory
,
leaning
on
a
very
blue
column
with
a
*NL*
yellow
capital
ornamented
with
this
inscription
:
*NL*
*NL*
MARINGO
*NL*
AUSTERLITS
*NL*
IENA
*NL*
WAGRAMME
*NL*
ELOT
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
this
frame
,
a
sort
of
wooden
panel
,
which
was
no
longer
than
it
*NL*
was
broad
,
stood
on
the
ground
and
rested
in
a
sloping
attitude
against
*NL*
the
wall
.
It
had
the
appearance
of
a
picture
with
its
face
turned
to
*NL*
the
wall
,
of
a
frame
probably
showing
a
daub
on
the
other
side
,
of
some
*NL*
pier-glass
detached
from
a
wall
and
lying
forgotten
there
while
waiting
*NL*
to
be
rehung
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
table
,
upon
which
Marius
descried
a
pen
,
ink
,
and
paper
,
sat
*NL*
a
man
about
sixty
years
of
age
,
small
,
thin
,
livid
,
haggard
,
with
a
*NL*
cunning
,
cruel
,
and
uneasy
air
;
a
hideous
scoundrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Lavater
had
studied
this
visage
,
he
would
have
found
the
vulture
*NL*
mingled
with
the
attorney
there
,
the
bird
of
prey
and
the
pettifogger
*NL*
rendering
each
other
mutually
hideous
and
complementing
each
other
;
the
*NL*
pettifogger
making
the
bird
of
prey
ignoble
,
the
bird
of
prey
making
the
*NL*
pettifogger
horrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
had
a
long
gray
beard
.
He
was
clad
in
a
woman
's
chemise
,
which
*NL*
allowed
his
hairy
breast
and
his
bare
arms
,
bristling
with
gray
hair
,
*NL*
to
be
seen
.
Beneath
this
chemise
,
muddy
trousers
and
boots
through
which
*NL*
his
toes
projected
were
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
pipe
in
his
mouth
and
was
smoking
.
There
was
no
bread
in
the
*NL*
hovel
,
but
there
was
still
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
writing
probably
some
more
letters
like
those
which
Marius
had
*NL*
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
corner
of
the
table
lay
an
ancient
,
dilapidated
,
reddish
volume
,
*NL*
and
the
size
,
which
was
the
antique
12mo
of
reading-rooms
,
betrayed
a
*NL*
romance
.
On
the
cover
sprawled
the
following
title
,
printed
in
large
*NL*
capitals
:
GOD
;
THE
KING
;
HONOR
AND
THE
LADIES
;
BY
DUCRAY
DUMINIL
,
1814
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
man
wrote
,
he
talked
aloud
,
and
Marius
heard
his
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
that
there
is
no
equality
,
even
when
you
are
dead
!
Just
look
*NL*
at
Pere
Lachaise
!
The
great
,
those
who
are
rich
,
are
up
above
,
in
the
*NL*
acacia
alley
,
which
is
paved
.
They
can
reach
it
in
a
carriage
.
The
*NL*
little
people
,
the
poor
,
the
unhappy
,
well
,
what
of
them
?
they
are
put
*NL*
down
below
,
where
the
mud
is
up
to
your
knees
,
in
the
damp
places
.
They
*NL*
are
put
there
so
that
they
will
decay
the
sooner
!
You
can
not
go
to
see
*NL*
them
without
sinking
into
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
smote
the
table
with
his
fist
,
and
added
,
as
he
ground
his
*NL*
teeth
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
could
eat
the
whole
world
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
big
woman
,
who
might
be
forty
years
of
age
,
or
a
hundred
,
was
*NL*
crouching
near
the
fireplace
on
her
bare
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
too
,
was
clad
only
in
a
chemise
and
a
knitted
petticoat
patched
*NL*
with
bits
of
old
cloth
.
A
coarse
linen
apron
concealed
the
half
of
her
*NL*
petticoat
.
Although
this
woman
was
doubled
up
and
bent
together
,
it
*NL*
could
be
seen
that
she
was
of
very
lofty
stature
.
She
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
giant
,
beside
her
husband
.
She
had
hideous
hair
,
of
a
reddish
blond
*NL*
which
was
turning
gray
,
and
which
she
thrust
back
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
with
her
enormous
shining
hands
,
with
their
flat
nails
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
her
,
on
the
floor
,
wide
open
,
lay
a
book
of
the
same
form
as
the
*NL*
other
,
and
probably
a
volume
of
the
same
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
of
the
pallets
,
Marius
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
sort
of
tall
pale
*NL*
young
girl
,
who
sat
there
half
naked
and
with
pendant
feet
,
and
who
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
be
listening
or
seeing
or
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
the
younger
sister
of
the
one
who
had
come
to
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
be
eleven
or
twelve
years
of
age
.
On
closer
scrutiny
it
*NL*
was
evident
that
she
really
was
fourteen
.
She
was
the
child
who
had
*NL*
said
,
on
the
boulevard
the
evening
before
:
``
I
bolted
,
bolted
,
bolted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
of
that
puny
sort
which
remains
backward
for
a
long
time
,
*NL*
then
suddenly
starts
up
rapidly
.
It
is
indigence
which
produces
these
*NL*
melancholy
human
plants
.
These
creatures
have
neither
childhood
nor
*NL*
youth
.
At
fifteen
years
of
age
they
appear
to
be
twelve
,
at
sixteen
they
*NL*
seem
twenty
.
To-day
a
little
girl
,
to-morrow
a
woman
.
One
might
say
*NL*
that
they
stride
through
life
,
in
order
to
get
through
with
it
the
more
*NL*
speedily
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
this
being
had
the
air
of
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
no
trace
of
work
was
revealed
in
that
dwelling
;
no
handicraft
,
*NL*
no
spinning-wheel
,
not
a
tool
.
In
one
corner
lay
some
ironmongery
of
*NL*
dubious
aspect
.
It
was
the
dull
listlessness
which
follows
despair
and
*NL*
precedes
the
death
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gazed
for
a
while
at
this
gloomy
interior
,
more
terrifying
than
*NL*
the
interior
of
a
tomb
,
for
the
human
soul
could
be
felt
fluttering
*NL*
there
,
and
life
was
palpitating
there
.
The
garret
,
the
cellar
,
the
lowly
*NL*
ditch
where
certain
indigent
wretches
crawl
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
*NL*
social
edifice
,
is
not
exactly
the
sepulchre
,
but
only
its
antechamber
;
*NL*
but
,
as
the
wealthy
display
their
greatest
magnificence
at
the
entrance
*NL*
of
their
palaces
,
it
seems
that
death
,
which
stands
directly
side
by
*NL*
side
with
them
,
places
its
greatest
miseries
in
that
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
held
his
peace
,
the
woman
spoke
no
word
,
the
young
girl
did
*NL*
not
even
seem
to
breathe
.
The
scratching
of
the
pen
on
the
paper
was
*NL*
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
grumbled
,
without
pausing
in
his
writing
.
``
Canaille
!
canaille
!
*NL*
everybody
is
canaille
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
variation
to
Solomon
's
exclamation
elicited
a
sigh
from
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
yourself
,
my
little
friend
,
''
she
said
.
``
Do
n't
hurt
yourself
,
my
*NL*
dear
.
You
are
too
good
to
write
to
all
those
people
,
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bodies
press
close
to
each
other
in
misery
,
as
in
cold
,
but
hearts
draw
*NL*
apart
.
This
woman
must
have
loved
this
man
,
to
all
appearance
,
judging
*NL*
from
the
amount
of
love
within
her
;
but
probably
,
in
the
daily
and
*NL*
reciprocal
reproaches
of
the
horrible
distress
which
weighed
on
the
*NL*
whole
group
,
this
had
become
extinct
.
There
no
longer
existed
in
her
*NL*
anything
more
than
the
ashes
of
affection
for
her
husband
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
caressing
appellations
had
survived
,
as
is
often
the
case
.
She
called
*NL*
him
:
My
dear
,
my
little
friend
,
my
good
man
,
etc.
,
with
her
mouth
while
*NL*
her
heart
was
silent

resumed

CHAPTER
VII
--
STRATEGY
AND
TACTICS
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
with
a
load
upon
his
breast
,
was
on
the
point
of
descending
*NL*
from
the
species
of
observatory
which
he
had
improvised
,
when
a
sound
*NL*
attracted
his
attention
and
caused
him
to
remain
at
his
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
attic
had
just
burst
open
abruptly
.
The
eldest
girl
made
*NL*
her
appearance
on
the
threshold
.
On
her
feet
,
she
had
large
,
coarse
,
*NL*
men
's
shoes
,
bespattered
with
mud
,
which
had
splashed
even
to
her
red
*NL*
ankles
,
and
she
was
wrapped
in
an
old
mantle
which
hung
in
tatters
.
*NL*
Marius
had
not
seen
it
on
her
an
hour
previously
,
but
she
had
probably
*NL*
deposited
it
at
his
door
,
in
order
that
she
might
inspire
the
more
pity
,
*NL*
and
had
picked
it
up
again
on
emerging
.
She
entered
,
pushed
the
door
to
*NL*
behind
her
,
paused
to
take
breath
,
for
she
was
completely
breathless
,
*NL*
then
exclaimed
with
an
expression
of
triumph
and
joy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
coming
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
turned
his
eyes
towards
her
,
the
woman
turned
her
head
,
the
*NL*
little
sister
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
demanded
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentleman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
philanthropist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
church
of
Saint-Jacques
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
old
fellow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
is
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
following
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
truly
,
he
is
coming
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
coming
in
a
fiacre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
fiacre
.
He
is
Rothschild
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
sure
?
If
he
is
coming
in
a
fiacre
,
how
is
it
that
you
*NL*
arrive
before
him
?
You
gave
him
our
address
at
least
?
Did
you
tell
him
*NL*
that
it
was
the
last
door
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
,
on
the
right
?
If
*NL*
he
only
does
not
make
a
mistake
!
So
you
found
him
at
the
church
?
Did
he
*NL*
read
my
letter
?
What
did
he
say
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ta
,
ta
,
ta
,
''
said
the
girl
,
``
how
you
do
gallop
on
,
my
good
man
!
See
*NL*
here
:
I
entered
the
church
,
he
was
in
his
usual
place
,
I
made
him
a
*NL*
reverence
,
and
I
handed
him
the
letter
;
he
read
it
and
said
to
me
:
*NL*
`
Where
do
you
live
,
my
child
?
'
I
said
:
`
Monsieur
,
I
will
show
you
.
'
He
*NL*
said
to
me
:
`
No
,
give
me
your
address
,
my
daughter
has
some
purchases
to
*NL*
make
,
I
will
take
a
carriage
and
reach
your
house
at
the
same
time
that
*NL*
you
do
.
'
I
gave
him
the
address
.
When
I
mentioned
the
house
,
he
seemed
*NL*
surprised
and
hesitated
for
an
instant
,
then
he
said
:
`
Never
mind
,
I
*NL*
will
come
.
'
When
the
mass
was
finished
,
I
watched
him
leave
the
church
*NL*
with
his
daughter
,
and
I
saw
them
enter
a
carriage
.
I
certainly
did
tell
*NL*
him
the
last
door
in
the
corridor
,
on
the
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
makes
you
think
that
he
will
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
seen
the
fiacre
turn
into
the
Rue
Petit-Banquier
.
That
is
*NL*
what
made
me
run
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
it
was
the
same
fiacre
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
took
notice
of
the
number
,
so
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
the
number
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
440
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
you
are
a
clever
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
stared
boldly
at
her
father
,
and
showing
the
shoes
which
she
*NL*
had
on
her
feet
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
clever
girl
,
possibly
;
but
I
tell
you
I
wo
n't
put
these
shoes
on
*NL*
again
,
and
that
I
wo
n't
,
for
the
sake
of
my
health
,
in
the
first
place
,
*NL*
and
for
the
sake
of
cleanliness
,
in
the
next
.
I
do
n't
know
anything
*NL*
more
irritating
than
shoes
that
squelch
,
and
go
ghi
,
ghi
,
ghi
,
the
whole
*NL*
time
.
I
prefer
to
go
barefoot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
''
said
her
father
,
in
a
sweet
tone
which
contrasted
with
*NL*
the
young
girl
's
rudeness
,
``
but
then
,
you
will
not
be
allowed
to
enter
*NL*
churches
,
for
poor
people
must
have
shoes
to
do
that
.
One
can
not
go
*NL*
barefoot
to
the
good
God
,
''
he
added
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
returning
to
the
subject
which
absorbed
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
sure
that
he
will
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
following
on
my
heels
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
started
up
.
A
sort
of
illumination
appeared
on
his
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wife
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
you
hear
.
Here
is
the
philanthropist
.
Extinguish
*NL*
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
stupefied
mother
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
,
with
the
agility
of
an
acrobat
,
seized
a
broken-nosed
jug
*NL*
which
stood
on
the
chimney
,
and
flung
the
water
on
the
brands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
addressing
his
eldest
daughter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
!
Pull
the
straw
off
that
chair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
did
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
the
chair
,
and
with
one
kick
he
rendered
it
seatless
.
His
leg
*NL*
passed
through
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
withdrew
his
leg
,
he
asked
his
daughter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
cold
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
cold
.
It
is
snowing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
turned
towards
the
younger
girl
who
sat
on
the
bed
near
the
*NL*
window
,
and
shouted
to
her
in
a
thundering
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
get
off
that
bed
,
you
lazy
thing
!
will
you
never
do
anything
?
*NL*
Break
a
pane
of
glass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
jumped
off
the
bed
with
a
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Break
a
pane
!
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
stood
still
in
bewilderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
me
?
''
repeated
her
father
,
``
I
tell
you
to
break
a
pane
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
with
a
sort
of
terrified
obedience
,
rose
on
tiptoe
,
and
*NL*
struck
a
pane
with
her
fist
.
The
glass
broke
and
fell
with
a
loud
*NL*
clatter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
grave
and
abrupt
.
His
glance
swept
rapidly
over
all
the
crannies
*NL*
of
the
garret
.
One
would
have
said
that
he
was
a
general
making
the
*NL*
final
preparation
at
the
moment
when
the
battle
is
on
the
point
of
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
,
who
had
not
said
a
word
so
far
,
now
rose
and
demanded
in
*NL*
a
dull
,
slow
,
languid
voice
,
whence
her
words
seemed
to
emerge
in
a
*NL*
congealed
state
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
to
do
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
into
bed
,
''
replied
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
intonation
admitted
of
no
deliberation
.
The
mother
obeyed
,
and
threw
*NL*
herself
heavily
on
one
of
the
pallets
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
a
sob
became
audible
in
one
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
?
''
cried
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
younger
daughter
exhibited
her
bleeding
fist
,
without
quitting
the
*NL*
corner
in
which
she
was
cowering
.
She
had
wounded
herself
while
breaking
*NL*
the
window
;
she
went
off
,
near
her
mother
's
pallet
and
wept
silently
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
the
mother
's
turn
to
start
up
and
exclaim
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
see
there
!
What
follies
you
commit
!
She
has
cut
herself
breaking
*NL*
that
pane
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
!
''
said
the
man
.
``
I
foresaw
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
So
much
the
better
?
''
retorted
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Peace
!
''
replied
the
father
,
``
I
suppress
the
liberty
of
the
press
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
tearing
the
woman
's
chemise
which
he
was
wearing
,
he
made
a
strip
*NL*
of
cloth
with
which
he
hastily
swathed
the
little
girl
's
bleeding
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
his
eye
fell
with
a
satisfied
expression
on
his
torn
chemise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
chemise
too
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
has
a
good
appearance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
icy
breeze
whistled
through
the
window
and
entered
the
room
.
The
*NL*
outer
mist
penetrated
thither
and
diffused
itself
like
a
whitish
sheet
*NL*
of
wadding
vaguely
spread
by
invisible
fingers
.
Through
the
broken
pane
*NL*
the
snow
could
be
seen
falling
.
The
snow
promised
by
the
Candlemas
sun
*NL*
of
the
preceding
day
had
actually
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
cast
a
glance
about
him
as
though
to
make
sure
that
he
had
*NL*
forgotten
nothing
.
He
seized
an
old
shovel
and
spread
ashes
over
the
wet
*NL*
brands
in
such
a
manner
as
to
entirely
conceal
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
drawing
himself
up
and
leaning
against
the
chimney-piece
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
we
can
receive
the
philanthropist
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
RAY
OF
LIGHT
IN
THE
HOVEL
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
girl
approached
and
laid
her
hand
in
her
father
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Feel
how
cold
I
am
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
replied
the
father
,
``
I
am
much
colder
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
exclaimed
impetuously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
always
have
something
better
than
any
one
else
,
so
you
do
!
even
bad
*NL*
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
with
you
!
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
,
being
eyed
after
a
certain
fashion
,
held
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
reigned
for
a
moment
in
the
hovel
.
The
elder
girl
was
removing
*NL*
the
mud
from
the
bottom
of
her
mantle
,
with
a
careless
air
;
her
younger
*NL*
sister
continued
to
sob
;
the
mother
had
taken
the
latter
's
head
between
*NL*
her
hands
,
and
was
covering
it
with
kisses
,
whispering
to
her
the
*NL*
while
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
treasure
,
I
entreat
you
,
it
is
nothing
of
consequence
,
do
n't
cry
,
*NL*
you
will
anger
your
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
''
exclaimed
the
father
,
``
quite
the
contrary
!
sob
!
sob
!
that
's
*NL*
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
to
the
elder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
!
He
is
not
coming
!
What
if
he
were
not
to
come
!
I
shall
have
*NL*
extinguished
my
fire
,
wrecked
my
chair
,
torn
my
shirt
,
and
broken
my
*NL*
pane
all
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
wounded
the
child
!
''
murmured
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
''
went
on
the
father
,
``
that
it
's
beastly
cold
in
this
*NL*
devil
's
garret
!
What
if
that
man
should
not
come
!
Oh
!
See
there
,
you
!
He
*NL*
makes
us
wait
!
He
says
to
himself
:
`
Well
!
they
will
wait
for
me
!
*NL*
That
's
what
they
're
there
for
.
'
Oh
!
how
I
hate
them
,
and
with
what
joy
,
*NL*
jubilation
,
enthusiasm
,
and
satisfaction
I
could
strangle
all
those
rich

folks

all
those
rich
folks

These
men
who
pretend
to
be
charitable

*NL*
who
put
on
airs

who
go
to
mass
,
who
make
presents
to
the
priesthood
,
*NL*
preachy
,
preachy
,
in
their
skullcaps
,
and
who
think
themselves
above
*NL*
us
,
and
who
come
for
the
purpose
of
humiliating
us
,
and
to
bring
us
*NL*
`
clothes
,
'
as
they
say
!
old
duds
that
are
not
worth
four
sous
!
And
*NL*
bread
!
That
's
not
what
I
want
,
pack
of
rascals
that
they
are
,
it
's
*NL*
money
!
Ah
!
money
!
Never
!
Because
they
say
that
we
would
go
off
and
drink
*NL*
it
up
,
and
that
we
are
drunkards
and
idlers

And
they

What
are

and
what

they
been
in
their
time

Thieves
!
They
never
could

have
become
rich
otherwise

Oh
!
Society
ought
to
be
grasped
by
the
four
*NL*
corners
of
the
cloth
and
tossed
into
the
air
,
all
of
it
!
It
would
all
*NL*
be
smashed
,
very
likely
,
but
at
least
,
no
one
would
have
anything
,
*NL*
and
there
would
be
that
much
gained
!
But
what
is
that
blockhead
of
*NL*
a
benevolent
gentleman
doing
?
Will
he
come
?
Perhaps
the
animal
has
*NL*
forgotten
the
address
!
I
'll
bet
that
that
old
beast
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
there
came
a
light
tap
at
the
door
,
the
man
rushed
to
it
*NL*
and
opened
it
,
exclaiming
,
amid
profound
bows
and
smiles
of
adoration
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enter
,
sir
!
Deign
to
enter
,
most
respected
benefactor
,
and
your
*NL*
charming
young
lady
,
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
of
ripe
age
and
a
young
girl
made
their
appearance
on
the
*NL*
threshold
of
the
attic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
not
quitted
his
post
.
His
feelings
for
the
moment
surpassed
*NL*
the
powers
of
the
human
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
She
!
*NL*
*NL*
Whoever
has
loved
knows
all
the
radiant
meanings
contained
in
those
*NL*
three
letters
of
that
word
:
She
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
she
.
Marius
could
hardly
distinguish
her
through
the
*NL*
luminous
vapor
which
had
suddenly
spread
before
his
eyes
.
It
was
that
*NL*
sweet
,
absent
being
,
that
star
which
had
beamed
upon
him
for
six
months
;
*NL*
it
was
those
eyes
,
that
brow
,
that
mouth
,
that
lovely
vanished
face
*NL*
which
had
created
night
by
its
departure
.
The
vision
had
been
eclipsed
,
*NL*
now
it
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
reappeared
in
that
gloom
,
in
that
garret
,
in
that
misshapen
attic
,
in
*NL*
all
that
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
shuddered
in
dismay
.
What
!
It
was
she
!
The
palpitations
of
his
*NL*
heart
troubled
his
sight
.
He
felt
that
he
was
on
the
brink
of
bursting
*NL*
into
tears
!
What
!
He
beheld
her
again
at
last
,
after
having
sought
her
*NL*
so
long
!
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
lost
his
soul
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
just
found
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
same
as
ever
,
only
a
little
pale
;
her
delicate
face
was
*NL*
framed
in
a
bonnet
of
violet
velvet
,
her
figure
was
concealed
beneath
*NL*
a
pelisse
of
black
satin
.
Beneath
her
long
dress
,
a
glimpse
could
be
*NL*
caught
of
her
tiny
foot
shod
in
a
silken
boot
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
accompanied
by
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
taken
a
few
steps
into
the
room
,
and
had
deposited
a
tolerably
*NL*
bulky
parcel
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
Jondrette
girl
had
retired
behind
the
door
,
and
was
staring
*NL*
with
sombre
eyes
at
that
velvet
bonnet
,
that
silk
mantle
,
and
that
*NL*
charming
,
happy
face
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
JONDRETTE
COMES
NEAR
WEEPING
*NL*
*NL*
The
hovel
was
so
dark
,
that
people
coming
from
without
felt
on
entering
*NL*
it
the
effect
produced
on
entering
a
cellar
.
The
two
new-comers
*NL*
advanced
,
therefore
,
with
a
certain
hesitation
,
being
hardly
able
*NL*
to
distinguish
the
vague
forms
surrounding
them
,
while
they
could
be
*NL*
clearly
seen
and
scrutinized
by
the
eyes
of
the
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
garret
,
who
were
accustomed
to
this
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
approached
,
with
his
sad
but
kindly
look
,
and
said
to
*NL*
Jondrette
the
father
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
in
this
package
you
will
find
some
new
clothes
and
some
*NL*
woollen
stockings
and
blankets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
angelic
benefactor
overwhelms
us
,
''
said
Jondrette
,
bowing
to
the
*NL*
very
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
bending
down
to
the
ear
of
his
eldest
daughter
,
while
the
two
*NL*
visitors
were
engaged
in
examining
this
lamentable
interior
,
he
added
in
*NL*
a
low
and
rapid
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
What
did
I
say
?
Duds
!
No
money
!
They
are
all
alike
!
By
the
way
,
*NL*
how
was
the
letter
to
that
old
blockhead
signed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fabantou
,
''
replied
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dramatic
artist
,
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
lucky
for
Jondrette
,
that
this
had
occurred
to
him
,
for
at
the
*NL*
very
moment
,
M.
Leblanc
turned
to
him
,
and
said
to
him
with
the
air
of
a
*NL*
person
who
is
seeking
to
recall
a
name
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
that
you
are
greatly
to
be
pitied
,
Monsieur
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fabantou
,
''
replied
Jondrette
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Fabantou
,
yes
,
that
is
it
.
I
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dramatic
artist
,
sir
,
and
one
who
has
had
some
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Jondrette
evidently
judged
the
moment
propitious
for
capturing
the
*NL*
``
philanthropist
.
''
He
exclaimed
with
an
accent
which
smacked
at
the
same
*NL*
time
of
the
vainglory
of
the
mountebank
at
fairs
,
and
the
humility
of
*NL*
the
mendicant
on
the
highway
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pupil
of
Talma
!
Sir
!
I
am
a
pupil
of
Talma
!
Fortune
formerly
smiled
*NL*
on
me
--
Alas
!
Now
it
is
misfortune
's
turn
.
You
see
,
my
benefactor
,
no
*NL*
bread
,
no
fire
.
My
poor
babes
have
no
fire
!
My
only
chair
has
no
seat
!
A
*NL*
broken
pane
!
And
in
such
weather
!
My
spouse
in
bed
!
Ill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
woman
!
''
said
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
wounded
!
''
added
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
diverted
by
the
arrival
of
the
strangers
,
had
fallen
to
*NL*
contemplating
``
the
young
lady
,
''
and
had
ceased
to
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cry
!
bawl
!
''
said
Jondrette
to
her
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
he
pinched
her
sore
hand
.
All
this
was
done
with
the
*NL*
talent
of
a
juggler
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
gave
vent
to
loud
shrieks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adorable
young
girl
,
whom
Marius
,
in
his
heart
,
called
``
his
Ursule
,
''
*NL*
approached
her
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
,
dear
child
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
my
beautiful
young
lady
,
''
pursued
Jondrette
``
her
bleeding
*NL*
wrist
!
It
came
through
an
accident
while
working
at
a
machine
to
earn
*NL*
six
sous
a
day
.
It
may
be
necessary
to
cut
off
her
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
?
''
said
the
old
gentleman
,
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
,
taking
this
seriously
,
fell
to
sobbing
more
violently
*NL*
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alas
!
yes
,
my
benefactor
!
''
replied
the
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
minutes
,
Jondrette
had
been
scrutinizing
``
the
benefactor
''
*NL*
in
a
singular
fashion
.
As
he
spoke
,
he
seemed
to
be
examining
the
other
*NL*
attentively
,
as
though
seeking
to
summon
up
his
recollections
.
All
at
*NL*
once
,
profiting
by
a
moment
when
the
new-comers
were
questioning
the
*NL*
child
with
interest
as
to
her
injured
hand
,
he
passed
near
his
wife
,
*NL*
who
lay
in
her
bed
with
a
stupid
and
dejected
air
,
and
said
to
her
in
a
*NL*
rapid
but
very
low
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
look
at
that
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
turning
to
M.
Leblanc
,
and
continuing
his
lamentations
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
sir
!
All
the
clothing
that
I
have
is
my
wife
's
chemise
!
And
*NL*
all
torn
at
that
!
In
the
depths
of
winter
!
I
ca
n't
go
out
for
lack
of
a
*NL*
coat
.
If
I
had
a
coat
of
any
sort
,
I
would
go
and
see
Mademoiselle
Mars
,
*NL*
who
knows
me
and
is
very
fond
of
me
.
Does
she
not
still
reside
in
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Tour-des-Dames
?
Do
you
know
,
sir
?
We
played
together
in
the
*NL*
provinces
.
I
shared
her
laurels
.
Celimene
would
come
to
my
succor
,
sir
!
*NL*
Elmire
would
bestow
alms
on
Belisaire
!
But
no
,
nothing
!
And
not
a
sou
in
*NL*
the
house
!
My
wife
ill
,
and
not
a
sou
!
My
daughter
dangerously
injured
,
*NL*
not
a
sou
!
My
wife
suffers
from
fits
of
suffocation
.
It
comes
from
her
*NL*
age
,
and
besides
,
her
nervous
system
is
affected
.
She
ought
to
have
*NL*
assistance
,
and
my
daughter
also
!
But
the
doctor
!
But
the
apothecary
!
*NL*
How
am
I
to
pay
them
?
I
would
kneel
to
a
penny
,
sir
!
Such
is
the
*NL*
condition
to
which
the
arts
are
reduced
.
And
do
you
know
,
my
charming
*NL*
young
lady
,
and
you
,
my
generous
protector
,
do
you
know
,
you
who
breathe
*NL*
forth
virtue
and
goodness
,
and
who
perfume
that
church
where
my
daughter
*NL*
sees
you
every
day
when
she
says
her
prayers
?
--
For
I
have
brought
up
my
*NL*
children
religiously
,
sir
.
I
did
not
want
them
to
take
to
the
theatre
.
*NL*
Ah
!
the
hussies
!
If
I
catch
them
tripping
!
I
do
not
jest
,
that
I
do
n't
!
*NL*
I
read
them
lessons
on
honor
,
on
morality
,
on
virtue
!
Ask
them
!
They
*NL*
have
got
to
walk
straight
.
They
are
none
of
your
unhappy
wretches
who
*NL*
begin
by
having
no
family
,
and
end
by
espousing
the
public
.
One
is
*NL*
Mamselle
Nobody
,
and
one
becomes
Madame
Everybody
.
Deuce
take
it
!
None
*NL*
of
that
in
the
Fabantou
family
!
I
mean
to
bring
them
up
virtuously
,
and
*NL*
they
shall
be
honest
,
and
nice
,
and
believe
in
God
,
by
the
sacred
name
!
*NL*
Well
,
sir
,
my
worthy
sir
,
do
you
know
what
is
going
to
happen
to-morrow
?
*NL*
To-morrow
is
the
fourth
day
of
February
,
the
fatal
day
,
the
last
day
of
*NL*
grace
allowed
me
by
my
landlord
;
if
by
this
evening
I
have
not
paid
my
*NL*
rent
,
to-morrow
my
oldest
daughter
,
my
spouse
with
her
fever
,
my
child
*NL*
with
her
wound
,
--
we
shall
all
four
be
turned
out
of
here
and
thrown
into
*NL*
the
street
,
on
the
boulevard
,
without
shelter
,
in
the
rain
,
in
the
snow
.
*NL*
There
,
sir
.
I
owe
for
four
quarters
--
a
whole
year
!
that
is
to
say
,
sixty
*NL*
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
lied
.
Four
quarters
would
have
amounted
to
only
forty
francs
,
*NL*
and
he
could
not
owe
four
,
because
six
months
had
not
elapsed
since
*NL*
Marius
had
paid
for
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
drew
five
francs
from
his
pocket
and
threw
them
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
found
time
to
mutter
in
the
ear
of
his
eldest
daughter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
scoundrel
!
What
does
he
think
I
can
do
with
his
five
francs
?
*NL*
That
wo
n't
pay
me
for
my
chair
and
pane
of
glass
!
That
's
what
comes
of
*NL*
incurring
expenses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
M.
Leblanc
had
removed
the
large
brown
great-coat
*NL*
which
he
wore
over
his
blue
coat
,
and
had
thrown
it
over
the
back
of
the
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Fabantou
,
''
he
said
,
``
these
five
francs
are
all
that
I
have
*NL*
about
me
,
but
I
shall
now
take
my
daughter
home
,
and
I
will
return
this
*NL*
evening
,
--
it
is
this
evening
that
you
must
pay
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
's
face
lighted
up
with
a
strange
expression
.
He
replied
*NL*
vivaciously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
respected
sir
.
At
eight
o'clock
,
I
must
be
at
my
landlord
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
be
here
at
six
,
and
I
will
fetch
you
the
sixty
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
benefactor
!
''
exclaimed
Jondrette
,
overwhelmed
.
And
he
added
,
in
a
*NL*
low
tone
:
``
Take
a
good
look
at
him
,
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
had
taken
the
arm
of
the
young
girl
,
once
more
,
and
had
*NL*
turned
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farewell
until
this
evening
,
my
friends
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
o'clock
?
''
said
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
o'clock
precisely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
overcoat
lying
on
the
chair
caught
the
eye
of
the
*NL*
elder
Jondrette
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
forgetting
your
coat
,
sir
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
darted
an
annihilating
look
at
his
daughter
,
accompanied
by
a
*NL*
formidable
shrug
of
the
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
turned
back
and
said
,
with
a
smile
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
forgotten
it
,
I
am
leaving
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
my
protector
!
''
said
Jondrette
,
``
my
august
benefactor
,
I
melt
into
*NL*
tears
!
Permit
me
to
accompany
you
to
your
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
come
out
,
''
answered
M.
Leblanc
,
``
put
on
this
coat
.
It
really
is
*NL*
very
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
did
not
need
to
be
told
twice
.
He
hastily
donned
the
brown
*NL*
great-coat
.
And
all
three
went
out
,
Jondrette
preceding
the
two
*NL*
strangers
.

*NL*
Marius
had
lost
nothing
of
this
entire
scene
,
and
yet
,
in
reality
,
had
*NL*
seen
nothing
.
His
eyes
had
remained
fixed
on
the
young
girl
,
his
heart
*NL*
had
,
so
to
speak
,
seized
her
and
wholly
enveloped
her
from
the
moment
of
*NL*
her
very
first
step
in
that
garret
.
During
her
entire
stay
there
,
he
*NL*
had
lived
that
life
of
ecstasy
which
suspends
material
perceptions
and
*NL*
precipitates
the
whole
soul
on
a
single
point
.
He
contemplated
,
not
that
*NL*
girl
,
but
that
light
which
wore
a
satin
pelisse
and
a
velvet
bonnet
.
The
*NL*
star
Sirius
might
have
entered
the
room
,
and
he
would
not
have
been
any
*NL*
more
dazzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
young
girl
was
engaged
in
opening
the
package
,
unfolding
the
*NL*
clothing
and
the
blankets
,
questioning
the
sick
mother
kindly
,
and
the
*NL*
little
injured
girl
tenderly
,
he
watched
her
every
movement
,
he
sought
*NL*
to
catch
her
words
.
He
knew
her
eyes
,
her
brow
,
her
beauty
,
her
form
,
*NL*
her
walk
,
he
did
not
know
the
sound
of
her
voice
.
He
had
once
fancied
*NL*
that
he
had
caught
a
few
words
at
the
Luxembourg
,
but
he
was
not
*NL*
absolutely
sure
of
the
fact
.
He
would
have
given
ten
years
of
his
life
*NL*
to
hear
it
,
in
order
that
he
might
bear
away
in
his
soul
a
little
of
*NL*
that
music
.
But
everything
was
drowned
in
the
lamentable
exclamations
*NL*
and
trumpet
bursts
of
Jondrette
.
This
added
a
touch
of
genuine
wrath
*NL*
to
Marius
'
ecstasy
.
He
devoured
her
with
his
eyes
.
He
could
not
believe
*NL*
that
it
really
was
that
divine
creature
whom
he
saw
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
those
vile
creatures
in
that
monstrous
lair
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
*NL*
beheld
a
humming-bird
in
the
midst
of
toads
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
took
her
departure
,
he
had
but
one
thought
,
to
follow
her
,
to
*NL*
cling
to
her
trace
,
not
to
quit
her
until
he
learned
where
she
*NL*
lived
,
not
to
lose
her
again
,
at
least
,
after
having
so
miraculously
*NL*
re-discovered
her
.
He
leaped
down
from
the
commode
and
seized
his
hat
.
*NL*
As
he
laid
his
hand
on
the
lock
of
the
door
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
opening
it
,
a
sudden
reflection
caused
him
to
pause
.
The
corridor
was
*NL*
long
,
the
staircase
steep
,
Jondrette
was
talkative
,
M.
Leblanc
had
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
not
yet
regained
his
carriage
;
if
,
on
turning
round
in
the
*NL*
corridor
,
or
on
the
staircase
,
he
were
to
catch
sight
of
him
,
Marius
,
*NL*
in
that
house
,
he
would
,
evidently
,
take
the
alarm
,
and
find
means
to
*NL*
escape
from
him
again
,
and
this
time
it
would
be
final
.
What
was
he
*NL*
to
do
?
Should
he
wait
a
little
?
But
while
he
was
waiting
,
the
carriage
*NL*
might
drive
off
.
Marius
was
perplexed
.
At
last
he
accepted
the
risk
and
*NL*
quitted
his
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
corridor
.
He
hastened
to
the
stairs
.
There
was
*NL*
no
one
on
the
staircase
.
He
descended
in
all
haste
,
and
reached
the
*NL*
boulevard
in
time
to
see
a
fiacre
turning
the
corner
of
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Petit-Banquier
,
on
its
way
back
to
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
rushed
headlong
in
that
direction
.
On
arriving
at
the
angle
of
*NL*
the
boulevard
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
fiacre
again
,
rapidly
descending
*NL*
the
Rue
Mouffetard
;
the
carriage
was
already
a
long
way
off
,
and
there
*NL*
was
no
means
of
overtaking
it
;
what
!
run
after
it
?
Impossible
;
and
*NL*
besides
,
the
people
in
the
carriage
would
assuredly
notice
an
individual
*NL*
running
at
full
speed
in
pursuit
of
a
fiacre
,
and
the
father
would
*NL*
recognize
him
.
At
that
moment
,
wonderful
and
unprecedented
good
luck
,
*NL*
Marius
perceived
an
empty
cab
passing
along
the
boulevard
.
There
was
but
*NL*
one
thing
to
be
done
,
to
jump
into
this
cab
and
follow
the
fiacre
.
That
*NL*
was
sure
,
efficacious
,
and
free
from
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
made
the
driver
a
sign
to
halt
,
and
called
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
wore
no
cravat
,
he
had
on
his
working-coat
,
which
was
destitute
*NL*
of
buttons
,
his
shirt
was
torn
along
one
of
the
plaits
on
the
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
driver
halted
,
winked
,
and
held
out
his
left
hand
to
Marius
,
rubbing
*NL*
his
forefinger
gently
with
his
thumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pay
in
advance
,
''
said
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
recollected
that
he
had
but
sixteen
sous
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forty
sous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
pay
on
my
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
driver
's
only
reply
was
to
whistle
the
air
of
La
Palisse
and
to
whip
*NL*
up
his
horse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
stared
at
the
retreating
cabriolet
with
a
bewildered
air
.
For
the
*NL*
lack
of
four
and
twenty
sous
,
he
was
losing
his
joy
,
his
happiness
,
*NL*
his
love
!
He
had
seen
,
and
he
was
becoming
blind
again
.
He
reflected
*NL*
bitterly
,
and
it
must
be
confessed
,
with
profound
regret
,
on
the
five
*NL*
francs
which
he
had
bestowed
,
that
very
morning
,
on
that
miserable
girl
.
*NL*
If
he
had
had
those
five
francs
,
he
would
have
been
saved
,
he
would
have
*NL*
been
born
again
,
he
would
have
emerged
from
the
limbo
and
darkness
,
he
*NL*
would
have
made
his
escape
from
isolation
and
spleen
,
from
his
widowed
*NL*
state
;
he
might
have
re-knotted
the
black
thread
of
his
destiny
to
that
*NL*
beautiful
golden
thread
,
which
had
just
floated
before
his
eyes
and
*NL*
had
broken
at
the
same
instant
,
once
more
!
He
returned
to
his
hovel
in
*NL*
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
have
told
himself
that
M.
Leblanc
had
promised
to
return
in
*NL*
the
evening
,
and
that
all
he
had
to
do
was
to
set
about
the
matter
more
*NL*
skilfully
,
so
that
he
might
follow
him
on
that
occasion
;
but
,
in
his
*NL*
contemplation
,
it
is
doubtful
whether
he
had
heard
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
was
on
the
point
of
mounting
the
staircase
,
he
perceived
,
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
the
boulevard
,
near
the
deserted
wall
skirting
the
Rue
De
*NL*
la
Barriere-des-Gobelins
,
Jondrette
,
wrapped
in
the
``
philanthropist
's
''
*NL*
great-coat
,
engaged
in
conversation
with
one
of
those
men
of
disquieting
*NL*
aspect
who
have
been
dubbed
by
common
consent
,
prowlers
of
the
barriers
;
*NL*
people
of
equivocal
face
,
of
suspicious
monologues
,
who
present
the
*NL*
air
of
having
evil
minds
,
and
who
generally
sleep
in
the
daytime
,
which
*NL*
suggests
the
supposition
that
they
work
by
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
men
,
standing
there
motionless
and
in
conversation
,
in
the
*NL*
snow
which
was
falling
in
whirlwinds
,
formed
a
group
that
a
policeman
*NL*
would
surely
have
observed
,
but
which
Marius
hardly
noticed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
in
spite
of
his
mournful
preoccupation
,
he
could
not
refrain
from
*NL*
saying
to
himself
that
this
prowler
of
the
barriers
with
whom
Jondrette
*NL*
was
talking
resembled
a
certain
Panchaud
,
alias
Printanier
,
alias
*NL*
Bigrenaille
,
whom
Courfeyrac
had
once
pointed
out
to
him
as
a
very
*NL*
dangerous
nocturnal
roamer
.
This
man
's
name
the
reader
has
learned
in
*NL*
the
preceding
book
.
This
Panchaud
,
alias
Printanier
,
alias
Bigrenaille
,
*NL*
figured
later
on
in
many
criminal
trials
,
and
became
a
notorious
rascal
.
*NL*
He
was
at
that
time
only
a
famous
rascal
.
To-day
he
exists
in
the
state
*NL*
of
tradition
among
ruffians
and
assassins
.
He
was
at
the
head
of
*NL*
a
school
towards
the
end
of
the
last
reign
.
And
in
the
evening
,
at
*NL*
nightfall
,
at
the
hour
when
groups
form
and
talk
in
whispers
,
he
was
*NL*
discussed
at
La
Force
in
the
Fosse-aux-Lions
.
One
might
even
,
in
*NL*
that
prison
,
precisely
at
the
spot
where
the
sewer
which
served
the
*NL*
unprecedented
escape
,
in
broad
daylight
,
of
thirty
prisoners
,
in
1843
,
*NL*
passes
under
the
culvert
,
read
his
name
,
PANCHAUD
,
audaciously
carved
*NL*
by
his
own
hand
on
the
wall
of
the
sewer
,
during
one
of
his
attempts
at
*NL*
flight
.
In
1832
,
the
police
already
had
their
eye
on
him
,
but
he
had
not
*NL*
as
yet
made
a
serious
beginning
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
OFFERS
OF
SERVICE
FROM
MISERY
TO
WRETCHEDNESS
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
ascended
the
stairs
of
the
hovel
with
slow
steps
;
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
he
was
about
to
re-enter
his
cell
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
elder
*NL*
Jondrette
girl
following
him
through
the
corridor
.
The
very
sight
of
*NL*
this
girl
was
odious
to
him
;
it
was
she
who
had
his
five
francs
,
it
was
*NL*
too
late
to
demand
them
back
,
the
cab
was
no
longer
there
,
the
fiacre
*NL*
was
far
away
.
Moreover
,
she
would
not
have
given
them
back
.
As
for
*NL*
questioning
her
about
the
residence
of
the
persons
who
had
just
been
*NL*
there
,
that
was
useless
;
it
was
evident
that
she
did
not
know
,
since
the
*NL*
letter
signed
Fabantou
had
been
addressed
``
to
the
benevolent
gentleman
*NL*
of
the
church
of
Saint-Jacquesdu-Haut-Pas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
entered
his
room
and
pushed
the
door
to
after
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
close
;
he
turned
round
and
beheld
a
hand
which
held
the
door
*NL*
half
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
he
asked
,
``
who
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
Jondrette
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
you
?
''
resumed
Marius
almost
harshly
,
``
still
you
!
What
do
you
want
*NL*
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
to
be
thoughtful
and
did
not
look
at
him
.
She
no
longer
had
*NL*
the
air
of
assurance
which
had
characterized
her
that
morning
.
She
did
*NL*
not
enter
,
but
held
back
in
the
darkness
of
the
corridor
,
where
Marius
*NL*
could
see
her
through
the
half-open
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
will
you
answer
?
''
cried
Marius
.
``
What
do
you
want
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
dull
eyes
,
in
which
a
sort
of
gleam
seemed
to
flicker
*NL*
vaguely
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Marius
,
you
look
sad
.
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
!
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
there
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gave
the
door
another
push
,
but
she
retained
her
hold
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
''
said
she
,
``
you
are
in
the
wrong
.
Although
you
are
not
rich
,
you
*NL*
were
kind
this
morning
.
Be
so
again
now
.
You
gave
me
something
to
eat
,
*NL*
now
tell
me
what
ails
you
.
You
are
grieved
,
that
is
plain
.
I
do
not
want
*NL*
you
to
be
grieved
.
What
can
be
done
for
it
?
Can
I
be
of
any
service
?
*NL*
Employ
me
.
I
do
not
ask
for
your
secrets
,
you
need
not
tell
them
to
me
,
*NL*
but
I
may
be
of
use
,
nevertheless
.
I
may
be
able
to
help
you
,
since
I
*NL*
help
my
father
.
When
it
is
necessary
to
carry
letters
,
to
go
to
houses
,
*NL*
to
inquire
from
door
to
door
,
to
find
out
an
address
,
to
follow
any
one
,
*NL*
I
am
of
service
.
Well
,
you
may
assuredly
tell
me
what
is
the
matter
with
*NL*
you
,
and
I
will
go
and
speak
to
the
persons
;
sometimes
it
is
enough
if
*NL*
some
one
speaks
to
the
persons
,
that
suffices
to
let
them
understand
*NL*
matters
,
and
everything
comes
right
.
Make
use
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
flashed
across
Marius
'
mind
.
What
branch
does
one
disdain
when
*NL*
one
feels
that
one
is
falling
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
near
to
the
Jondrette
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
--
''
he
said
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
interrupted
him
with
a
gleam
of
joy
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
do
call
me
thou
!
I
like
that
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
resumed
,
``
thou
hast
brought
hither
that
old
gentleman
and
his
*NL*
daughter
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
their
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Find
it
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jondrette
's
dull
eyes
had
grown
joyous
,
and
they
now
became
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
what
you
want
?
''
she
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
to
say
,
''
she
resumed
quickly
,
``
you
do
not
know
her
,
but
you
*NL*
wish
to
know
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
them
which
had
turned
into
her
had
something
indescribably
*NL*
significant
and
bitter
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
can
you
do
it
?
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
the
beautiful
lady
's
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
a
shade
in
the
words
``
the
beautiful
lady
''
which
troubled
*NL*
Marius
.
He
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
after
all
,
the
address
of
the
father
and
daughter
.
Their
*NL*
address

indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gazed
fixedly
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
you
give
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
I
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
the
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
head
;
then
,
with
a
brusque
movement
,
she
pulled
to
the
*NL*
door
,
which
closed
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
found
himself
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dropped
into
a
chair
,
with
his
head
and
both
elbows
on
his
bed
,
*NL*
absorbed
in
thoughts
which
he
could
not
grasp
,
and
as
though
a
prey
to
*NL*
vertigo
.
All
that
had
taken
place
since
the
morning
,
the
appearance
of
*NL*
the
angel
,
her
disappearance
,
what
that
creature
had
just
said
to
him
,
a
*NL*
gleam
of
hope
floating
in
an
immense
despair
,
--
this
was
what
filled
his
*NL*
brain
confusedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
was
violently
aroused
from
his
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
the
shrill
,
hard
voice
of
Jondrette
utter
these
words
,
which
*NL*
were
fraught
with
a
strange
interest
for
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
I
am
sure
of
it
,
and
that
I
recognized
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Of
whom
was
Jondrette
speaking
?
Whom
had
he
recognized
?
M.
Leblanc
?
The
*NL*
father
of
``
his
Ursule
''
?
What
!
Did
Jondrette
know
him
?
Was
Marius
about
*NL*
to
obtain
in
this
abrupt
and
unexpected
fashion
all
the
information
*NL*
without
which
his
life
was
so
dark
to
him
?
Was
he
about
to
learn
at
last
*NL*
who
it
was
that
he
loved
,
who
that
young
girl
was
?
Who
her
father
*NL*
was
?
Was
the
dense
shadow
which
enwrapped
them
on
the
point
of
being
*NL*
dispelled
?
Was
the
veil
about
to
be
rent
?
Ah
!
Heavens
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
bounded
rather
than
climbed
upon
his
commode
,
and
resumed
his
post
*NL*
near
the
little
peep-hole
in
the
partition
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
beheld
the
interior
of
Jondrette
's
hovel
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
THE
USE
MADE
OF
M.
LEBLANC
'S
FIVE-FRANC
PIECE
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
in
the
aspect
of
the
family
was
altered
,
except
that
the
wife
*NL*
and
daughters
had
levied
on
the
package
and
put
on
woollen
stockings
and
*NL*
jackets
.
Two
new
blankets
were
thrown
across
the
two
beds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
had
evidently
just
returned
.
He
still
had
the
breathlessness
*NL*
of
out
of
doors
.
His
daughters
were
seated
on
the
floor
near
the
*NL*
fireplace
,
the
elder
engaged
in
dressing
the
younger
's
wounded
hand
.
His
*NL*
wife
had
sunk
back
on
the
bed
near
the
fireplace
,
with
a
face
indicative
*NL*
of
astonishment
.
Jondrette
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
garret
with
long
*NL*
strides
.
His
eyes
were
extraordinary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
,
who
seemed
timid
and
overwhelmed
with
stupor
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
her
husband
,
turned
to
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
really
?
You
are
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
!
Eight
years
have
passed
!
But
I
recognize
him
!
Ah
!
I
recognize
*NL*
him
.
I
knew
him
at
once
!
What
!
Did
n't
it
force
itself
on
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
told
you
:
`
Pay
attention
!
'
Why
,
it
is
his
figure
,
it
is
his
face
,
*NL*
only
older
,
--
there
are
people
who
do
not
grow
old
,
I
do
n't
know
how
they
*NL*
manage
it
,
--
it
is
the
very
sound
of
his
voice
.
He
is
better
dressed
,
*NL*
that
is
all
!
Ah
!
you
mysterious
old
devil
,
I
've
got
you
,
that
I
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
said
to
his
daughters
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
out
of
here
,
you
!
--
It
's
queer
that
it
did
n't
strike
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
arose
to
obey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
stammered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
her
injured
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
air
will
do
it
good
,
''
said
Jondrette
.
``
Be
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
plain
that
this
man
was
of
the
sort
to
whom
no
one
offers
to
*NL*
reply
.
The
two
girls
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
they
were
about
to
pass
through
the
door
,
the
father
*NL*
detained
the
elder
by
the
arm
,
and
said
to
her
with
a
peculiar
accent
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
be
here
at
five
o'clock
precisely
.
Both
of
you
.
I
shall
need
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
redoubled
his
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
being
left
alone
with
his
wife
,
Jondrette
began
to
pace
the
room
*NL*
again
,
and
made
the
tour
of
it
two
or
three
times
in
silence
.
Then
he
*NL*
spent
several
minutes
in
tucking
the
lower
part
of
the
woman
's
chemise
*NL*
which
he
wore
into
his
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
turned
to
the
female
Jondrette
,
folded
his
arms
and
*NL*
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
would
you
like
to
have
me
tell
you
something
?
The
young
lady
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
?
''
retorted
his
wife
,
``
the
young
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
could
not
doubt
that
it
was
really
she
of
whom
they
were
*NL*
speaking
.
He
listened
with
ardent
anxiety
.
His
whole
life
was
in
his
*NL*
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jondrette
had
bent
over
and
spoke
to
his
wife
in
a
whisper
.
Then
he
*NL*
straightened
himself
up
and
concluded
aloud
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
one
?
''
said
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
very
one
,
''
said
the
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
expression
can
reproduce
the
significance
of
the
mother
's
words
.
*NL*
Surprise
,
rage
,
hate
,
wrath
,
were
mingled
and
combined
in
one
monstrous
*NL*
intonation
.
The
pronunciation
of
a
few
words
,
the
name
,
no
doubt
,
which
*NL*
her
husband
had
whispered
in
her
ear
,
had
sufficed
to
rouse
this
huge
,
*NL*
somnolent
woman
,
and
from
being
repulsive
she
became
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
possible
!
''
she
cried
.
``
When
I
think
that
my
daughters
are
*NL*
going
barefoot
,
and
have
not
a
gown
to
their
backs
!
What
!
A
satin
*NL*
pelisse
,
a
velvet
bonnet
,
boots
,
and
everything
;
more
than
two
hundred
*NL*
francs
'
worth
of
clothes
!
so
that
one
would
think
she
was
a
lady
!
No
,
*NL*
you
are
mistaken
!
Why
,
in
the
first
place
,
the
other
was
hideous
,
and
*NL*
this
one
is
not
so
bad-looking
!
She
really
is
not
bad-looking
!
It
ca
n't
*NL*
be
she
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
it
is
she
.
You
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
absolute
assertion
,
the
Jondrette
woman
raised
her
large
,
red
,
*NL*
blonde
face
and
stared
at
the
ceiling
with
a
horrible
expression
.
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
she
seemed
to
Marius
even
more
to
be
feared
than
her
*NL*
husband
.
She
was
a
sow
with
the
look
of
a
tigress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
she
resumed
,
``
that
horrible
,
beautiful
young
lady
,
who
gazed
at
*NL*
my
daughters
with
an
air
of
pity
,
--
she
is
that
beggar
brat
!
Oh
!
I
should
*NL*
like
to
kick
her
stomach
in
for
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
off
of
the
bed
,
and
remained
standing
for
a
moment
,
her
*NL*
hair
in
disorder
,
her
nostrils
dilating
,
her
mouth
half
open
,
her
fists
*NL*
clenched
and
drawn
back
.
Then
she
fell
back
on
the
bed
once
more
.
The
*NL*
man
paced
to
and
fro
and
paid
no
attention
to
his
female
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
silence
lasting
several
minutes
,
he
approached
the
female
*NL*
Jondrette
,
and
halted
in
front
of
her
,
with
folded
arms
,
as
he
had
done
*NL*
a
moment
before
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
shall
I
tell
you
another
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
answered
in
a
low
,
curt
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
fortune
is
made
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
stared
at
him
with
the
look
that
signifies
:
``
Is
the
person
who
*NL*
is
addressing
me
on
the
point
of
going
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thunder
!
It
was
not
so
very
long
ago
that
I
was
a
parishioner
of
*NL*
the
parish
of
*NL*
die-of-hunger-if-you-have-a-fire
,
-
die-of-cold-if-you-have-bread
!
I
have
*NL*
had
enough
of
misery
!
my
share
and
other
people
's
share
!
I
am
not
joking
*NL*
any
longer
,
I
do
n't
find
it
comic
any
more
,
I
've
had
enough
of
puns
,
*NL*
good
God
!
no
more
farces
,
Eternal
Father
!
I
want
to
eat
till
I
am
full
,
*NL*
I
want
to
drink
my
fill

to
gormandize
!
to
sleep

to
do
nothing

I
want
*NL*
to
have
my
turn
,
so
I
do
,
come
now
!
before
I
die
!
I
want
to
be
a
bit
of
*NL*
a
millionnaire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
turn
round
the
hovel
,
and
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
other
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
asked
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
,
winked
,
screwed
up
one
eye
,
and
raised
his
voice
like
*NL*
a
medical
professor
who
is
about
to
make
a
demonstration
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I
mean
by
that
?
Listen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
muttered
the
woman
,
``
not
so
loud
!
These
are
matters
which
must
*NL*
not
be
overheard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
Who
's
here
?
Our
neighbor
?
I
saw
him
go
out
a
little
while
ago
.
*NL*
Besides
,
he
does
n't
listen
,
the
big
booby
.
And
I
tell
you
that
I
saw
him
*NL*
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
by
a
sort
of
instinct
,
Jondrette
lowered
his
voice
,
*NL*
although
not
sufficiently
to
prevent
Marius
hearing
his
words
.
One
*NL*
favorable
circumstance
,
which
enabled
Marius
not
to
lose
a
word
of
this
*NL*
conversation
was
the
falling
snow
which
deadened
the
sound
of
vehicles
*NL*
on
the
boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
Marius
heard
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
carefully
.
The
Croesus
is
caught
,
or
as
good
as
caught
!
That
's
*NL*
all
settled
already
.
Everything
is
arranged
.
I
have
seen
some
people
.
He
*NL*
will
come
here
this
evening
at
six
o'clock
.
To
bring
sixty
francs
,
the
*NL*
rascal
!
Did
you
notice
how
I
played
that
game
on
him
,
my
sixty
francs
,
*NL*
my
landlord
,
my
fourth
of
February
?
I
do
n't
even
owe
for
one
quarter
!
*NL*
Is
n't
he
a
fool
!
So
he
will
come
at
six
o'clock
!
That
's
the
hour
when
*NL*
our
neighbor
goes
to
his
dinner
.
Mother
Bougon
is
off
washing
dishes
in
*NL*
the
city
.
There
's
not
a
soul
in
the
house
.
The
neighbor
never
comes
home
*NL*
until
eleven
o'clock
.
The
children
shall
stand
on
watch
.
You
shall
help
*NL*
us
.
He
will
give
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
if
he
does
not
give
in
?
''
demanded
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
made
a
sinister
gesture
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
fix
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
time
Marius
had
seen
him
laugh
.
The
laugh
was
cold
*NL*
and
sweet
,
and
provoked
a
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
opened
a
cupboard
near
the
fireplace
,
and
drew
from
it
an
old
*NL*
cap
,
which
he
placed
on
his
head
,
after
brushing
it
with
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'm
going
out
.
I
have
some
more
people
that
I
must
see
.
*NL*
Good
ones
.
You
'll
see
how
well
the
whole
thing
will
work
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
away
as
short
a
time
as
possible
,
it
's
a
fine
stroke
of
business
,
do
you
*NL*
look
after
the
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
both
fists
thrust
into
the
pockets
of
his
trousers
,
he
stood
*NL*
for
a
moment
in
thought
,
then
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
it
's
mighty
lucky
,
by
the
way
,
that
he
did
n't
recognize
*NL*
me
!
If
he
had
recognized
me
on
his
side
,
he
would
not
have
come
back
*NL*
again
.
He
would
have
slipped
through
our
fingers
!
It
was
my
beard
that
*NL*
saved
us
!
my
romantic
beard
!
my
pretty
little
romantic
beard
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
broke
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stepped
to
the
window
.
The
snow
was
still
falling
,
and
streaking
the
*NL*
gray
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
beastly
weather
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
lapping
his
overcoat
across
his
breast
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
rind
is
too
large
for
me
.
Never
mind
,
''
he
added
,
``
he
did
a
*NL*
devilish
good
thing
in
leaving
it
for
me
,
the
old
scoundrel
!
If
it
*NL*
had
n't
been
for
that
,
I
could
n't
have
gone
out
,
and
everything
would
*NL*
have
gone
wrong
!
What
small
points
things
hang
on
,
anyway
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
pulling
his
cap
down
over
his
eyes
,
he
quitted
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
barely
had
time
to
take
half
a
dozen
steps
from
the
door
,
when
*NL*
the
door
opened
again
,
and
his
savage
but
intelligent
face
made
its
*NL*
appearance
once
more
in
the
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
near
forgetting

''
said
he
.
``
You
are
to
have
a
brazier
of
*NL*
charcoal
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
flung
into
his
wife
's
apron
the
five-franc
piece
which
the
*NL*
``
philanthropist
''
had
left
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

asked
his

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
``

many

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Something

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whereabouts

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

yes

corner

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
tell
me
how

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
word
from
his
wife
,
Jondrette
closed
the
door
again
,
and
this
*NL*
time
,
Marius
heard
his
step
die
away
in
the
corridor
of
the
hovel
,
and
*NL*
descend
the
staircase
rapidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
At

*NL*
PATER
NOSTER
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
dreamer
as
he
was
,
was
,
as
we
have
said
,
firm
and
energetic
by
*NL*
nature
.
His
habits
of
solitary
meditation
,
while
they
had
developed
in
*NL*
him
sympathy
and
compassion
,
had
,
perhaps
,
diminished
the
faculty
for
*NL*
irritation
,
but
had
left
intact
the
power
of
waxing
indignant
;
he
had
*NL*
the
kindliness
of
a
brahmin
,
and
the
severity
of
a
judge
;
he
took
pity
*NL*
upon
a
toad
,
but
he
crushed
a
viper
.
Now
,
it
was
into
a
hole
of
vipers
*NL*
that
his
glance
had
just
been
directed
,
it
was
a
nest
of
monsters
that
*NL*
he
had
beneath
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
wretches
must
be
stamped
upon
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
one
of
the
enigmas
which
he
had
hoped
to
see
solved
had
been
*NL*
elucidated
;
on
the
contrary
,
all
of
them
had
been
rendered
more
dense
,
*NL*
if
anything
;
he
knew
nothing
more
about
the
beautiful
maiden
of
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
and
the
man
whom
he
called
M.
Leblanc
,
except
that
Jondrette
*NL*
was
acquainted
with
them
.
Athwart
the
mysterious
words
which
had
been
*NL*
uttered
,
the
only
thing
of
which
he
caught
a
distinct
glimpse
was
the
*NL*
fact
that
an
ambush
was
in
course
of
preparation
,
a
dark
but
terrible
*NL*
trap
;
that
both
of
them
were
incurring
great
danger
,
she
probably
,
her
*NL*
father
certainly
;
that
they
must
be
saved
;
that
the
hideous
plots
of
the
*NL*
Jondrettes
must
be
thwarted
,
and
the
web
of
these
spiders
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
scanned
the
female
Jondrette
for
a
moment
.
She
had
pulled
an
old
*NL*
sheet-iron
stove
from
a
corner
,
and
she
was
rummaging
among
the
old
heap
*NL*
of
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
from
the
commode
as
softly
as
possible
,
taking
care
not
to
*NL*
make
the
least
noise
.
Amid
his
terror
as
to
what
was
in
preparation
,
and
*NL*
in
the
horror
with
which
the
Jondrettes
had
inspired
him
,
he
experienced
*NL*
a
sort
of
joy
at
the
idea
that
it
might
be
granted
to
him
perhaps
to
*NL*
render
a
service
to
the
one
whom
he
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
was
it
to
be
done
?
How
warn
the
persons
threatened
?
He
did
not
*NL*
know
their
address
.
They
had
reappeared
for
an
instant
before
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
had
then
plunged
back
again
into
the
immense
depths
of
Paris
.
Should
*NL*
he
wait
for
M.
Leblanc
at
the
door
that
evening
at
six
o'clock
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
of
his
arrival
,
and
warn
him
of
the
trap
?
But
Jondrette
and
his
*NL*
men
would
see
him
on
the
watch
,
the
spot
was
lonely
,
they
were
stronger
*NL*
than
he
,
they
would
devise
means
to
seize
him
or
to
get
him
away
,
and
*NL*
the
man
whom
Marius
was
anxious
to
save
would
be
lost
.
One
o'clock
had
*NL*
just
struck
,
the
trap
was
to
be
sprung
at
six
.
Marius
had
five
hours
*NL*
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
thing
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
on
his
decent
coat
,
knotted
a
silk
handkerchief
round
his
neck
,
*NL*
took
his
hat
,
and
went
out
,
without
making
any
more
noise
than
if
he
had
*NL*
been
treading
on
moss
with
bare
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
Jondrette
woman
continued
to
rummage
among
her
old
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
outside
of
the
house
,
he
made
for
the
Rue
du
Petit-Banquier
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
almost
reached
the
middle
of
this
street
,
near
a
very
low
wall
*NL*
which
a
man
can
easily
step
over
at
certain
points
,
and
which
abuts
on
*NL*
a
waste
space
,
and
was
walking
slowly
,
in
consequence
of
his
preoccupied
*NL*
condition
,
and
the
snow
deadened
the
sound
of
his
steps
;
all
at
once
he
*NL*
heard
voices
talking
very
close
by
.
He
turned
his
head
,
the
street
was
*NL*
deserted
,
there
was
not
a
soul
in
it
,
it
was
broad
daylight
,
and
yet
he
*NL*
distinctly
heard
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
him
to
glance
over
the
wall
which
he
was
skirting
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
in
fact
,
sat
two
men
,
flat
on
the
snow
,
with
their
backs
against
*NL*
the
wall
,
talking
together
in
subdued
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
persons
were
strangers
to
him
;
one
was
a
bearded
man
in
a
*NL*
blouse
,
and
the
other
a
long-haired
individual
in
rags
.
The
bearded
man
*NL*
had
on
a
fez
,
the
other
's
head
was
bare
,
and
the
snow
had
lodged
in
his
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
thrusting
his
head
over
the
wall
,
Marius
could
hear
their
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hairy
one
jogged
the
other
man
's
elbow
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
With
the
assistance
of
Patron-Minette
,
it
ca
n't
fail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
said
the
bearded
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
long-haired
one
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
good
as
a
warrant
for
each
one
,
of
five
hundred
balls
,
and
the
*NL*
worst
that
can
happen
is
five
years
,
six
years
,
ten
years
at
the
most
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
replied
with
some
hesitation
,
and
shivering
beneath
his
fez
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
real
thing
.
You
ca
n't
go
against
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
that
the
affair
ca
n't
go
wrong
,
''
resumed
the
long-haired
*NL*
man
.
``
Father
What
's
-
his-name
's
team
will
be
already
harnessed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
began
to
discuss
a
melodrama
that
they
had
seen
on
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
at
the
Gaite
Theatre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
went
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
the
mysterious
words
of
these
men
,
so
strangely
*NL*
hidden
behind
that
wall
,
and
crouching
in
the
snow
,
could
not
but
bear
*NL*
some
relation
to
Jondrette
's
abominable
projects
.
That
must
be
the
*NL*
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
directed
his
course
towards
the
faubourg
Saint-Marceau
and
asked
at
*NL*
the
first
shop
he
came
to
where
he
could
find
a
commissary
of
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
directed
to
Rue
de
Pontoise
,
No.
14
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thither
Marius
betook
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
passed
a
baker
's
shop
,
he
bought
a
two-penny
roll
,
and
ate
it
,
*NL*
foreseeing
that
he
should
not
dine
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
way
,
he
rendered
justice
to
Providence
.
He
reflected
that
had
he
*NL*
not
given
his
five
francs
to
the
Jondrette
girl
in
the
morning
,
he
*NL*
would
have
followed
M.
Leblanc
's
fiacre
,
and
consequently
have
remained
*NL*
ignorant
of
everything
,
and
that
there
would
have
been
no
obstacle
to
*NL*
the
trap
of
the
Jondrettes
and
that
M.
Leblanc
would
have
been
lost
,
and
*NL*
his
daughter
with
him
,
no
doubt
.

CHAPTER
XIV
--
IN
WHICH
A
POLICE
AGENT
BESTOWS
TWO
FISTFULS
ON
A
LAWYER
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
No.
14
,
Rue
de
Pontoise
,
he
ascended
to
the
first
floor
*NL*
and
inquired
for
the
commissary
of
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
commissary
of
police
is
not
here
,
''
said
a
clerk
;
``
but
there
is
an
*NL*
inspector
who
takes
his
place
.
Would
you
like
to
speak
to
him
?
Are
you
*NL*
in
haste
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clerk
introduced
him
into
the
commissary
's
office
.
There
stood
a
*NL*
tall
man
behind
a
grating
,
leaning
against
a
stove
,
and
holding
up
with
*NL*
both
hands
the
tails
of
a
vast
topcoat
,
with
three
collars
.
His
face
*NL*
was
square
,
with
a
thin
,
firm
mouth
,
thick
,
gray
,
and
very
ferocious
*NL*
whiskers
,
and
a
look
that
was
enough
to
turn
your
pockets
inside
out
.
*NL*
Of
that
glance
it
might
have
been
well
said
,
not
that
it
penetrated
,
but
*NL*
that
it
searched
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
's
air
was
not
much
less
ferocious
nor
less
terrible
than
*NL*
Jondrette
's
;
the
dog
is
,
at
times
,
no
less
terrible
to
meet
than
the
*NL*
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
he
said
to
Marius
,
without
adding
``
monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
Monsieur
le
Commissaire
de
Police
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
absent
.
I
am
here
in
his
stead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
matter
is
very
private
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
great
haste
is
required
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
speak
quick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
calm
,
abrupt
man
was
both
terrifying
and
reassuring
at
one
and
the
*NL*
same
time
.
He
inspired
fear
and
confidence
.
Marius
related
the
adventure
*NL*
to
him
:
That
a
person
with
whom
he
was
not
acquainted
otherwise
than
by
*NL*
sight
,
was
to
be
inveigled
into
a
trap
that
very
evening
;
that
,
as
he
*NL*
occupied
the
room
adjoining
the
den
,
he
,
Marius
Pontmercy
,
a
lawyer
,
*NL*
had
heard
the
whole
plot
through
the
partition
;
that
the
wretch
who
*NL*
had
planned
the
trap
was
a
certain
Jondrette
;
that
there
would
be
*NL*
accomplices
,
probably
some
prowlers
of
the
barriers
,
among
others
a
*NL*
certain
Panchaud
,
alias
Printanier
,
alias
Bigrenaille
;
that
Jondrette
's
*NL*
daughters
were
to
lie
in
wait
;
that
there
was
no
way
of
warning
the
*NL*
threatened
man
,
since
he
did
not
even
know
his
name
;
and
that
,
finally
,
*NL*
all
this
was
to
be
carried
out
at
six
o'clock
that
evening
,
at
the
most
*NL*
deserted
point
of
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
,
in
house
No.
50-52
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sound
of
this
number
,
the
inspector
raised
his
head
,
and
said
*NL*
coldly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
in
the
room
at
the
end
of
the
corridor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
''
answered
Marius
,
and
he
added
:
``
Are
you
acquainted
with
*NL*
that
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
replied
,
as
he
warmed
*NL*
the
heel
of
his
boot
at
the
door
of
the
stove
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apparently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
,
muttering
between
his
teeth
,
and
not
addressing
Marius
so
*NL*
much
as
his
cravat
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patron-Minette
must
have
had
a
hand
in
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
struck
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Patron-Minette
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
did
hear
that
word
pronounced
,
in
fact
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
repeated
to
the
inspector
the
dialogue
between
the
long-haired
*NL*
man
and
the
bearded
man
in
the
snow
behind
the
wall
of
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Petit-Banquier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
muttered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
long-haired
man
must
be
Brujon
,
and
the
bearded
one
Demi-Liard
,
*NL*
alias
Deux-Milliards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
dropped
his
eyelids
again
,
and
became
absorbed
in
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
Father
What
's
-
his-name
,
I
think
I
recognize
him
.
Here
,
I
've
*NL*
burned
my
coat
.
They
always
have
too
much
fire
in
these
cursed
stoves
.
*NL*
Number

.
Former
property

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
glanced
at
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
saw
only
that
bearded
and
that
long-haired
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Panchaud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
n't
see
a
little
imp
of
a
dandy
prowling
about
the
premises
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
a
big
lump
of
matter
,
resembling
an
elephant
in
the
Jardin
des
*NL*
Plantes
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
a
scamp
with
the
air
of
an
old
red
tail
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
the
fourth
,
no
one
sees
him
,
not
even
his
adjutants
,
clerks
,
and
*NL*
employees
.
It
is
not
surprising
that
you
did
not
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Who
are
all
those
persons
?
''
asked
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
this
is
not
the
time
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
relapsed
into
silence
,
then
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
50-52
.
I
know
that
barrack
.
Impossible
to
conceal
ourselves
inside
*NL*
it
without
the
artists
seeing
us
,
and
then
they
will
get
off
simply
*NL*
by
countermanding
the
vaudeville
.
They
are
so
modest
!
An
audience
*NL*
embarrasses
them
.
None
of
that
,
none
of
that
.
I
want
to
hear
them
sing
*NL*
and
make
them
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
monologue
concluded
,
he
turned
to
Marius
,
and
demanded
,
gazing
at
*NL*
him
intently
the
while
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
afraid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
?
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
these
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
than
yourself
!
''
retorted
Marius
rudely
,
who
had
begun
to
notice
*NL*
that
this
police
agent
had
not
yet
said
``
monsieur
''
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
stared
still
more
intently
at
Marius
,
and
continued
with
*NL*
sententious
solemnity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
you
speak
like
a
brave
man
,
and
like
an
honest
man
.
Courage
does
*NL*
not
fear
crime
,
and
honesty
does
not
fear
authority
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
interrupted
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
,
but
what
do
you
intend
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
contented
himself
with
the
remark
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
lodgers
have
pass-keys
with
which
to
get
in
at
night
.
You
must
have
*NL*
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
it
about
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
,
''
said
the
inspector
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
took
his
key
from
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
handed
it
to
the
*NL*
inspector
and
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
take
my
advice
,
you
will
come
in
force
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
inspector
cast
on
Marius
such
a
glance
as
Voltaire
might
have
*NL*
bestowed
on
a
provincial
academician
who
had
suggested
a
rhyme
to
him
;
*NL*
with
one
movement
he
plunged
his
hands
,
which
were
enormous
,
into
the
*NL*
two
immense
pockets
of
his
top-coat
,
and
pulled
out
two
small
steel
*NL*
pistols
,
of
the
sort
called
``
knock-me-downs
.
''
Then
he
presented
them
to
*NL*
Marius
,
saying
rapidly
,
in
a
curt
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
these
.
Go
home
.
Hide
in
your
chamber
,
so
that
you
may
be
supposed
*NL*
to
have
gone
out
.
They
are
loaded
.
Each
one
carries
two
balls
.
You
will
*NL*
keep
watch
;
there
is
a
hole
in
the
wall
,
as
you
have
informed
me
.
These
*NL*
men
will
come
.
Leave
them
to
their
own
devices
for
a
time
.
When
you
*NL*
think
matters
have
reached
a
crisis
,
and
that
it
is
time
to
put
a
stop
*NL*
to
them
,
fire
a
shot
.
Not
too
soon
.
The
rest
concerns
me
.
A
shot
into
*NL*
the
ceiling
,
the
air
,
no
matter
where
.
Above
all
things
,
not
too
soon
.
*NL*
Wait
until
they
begin
to
put
their
project
into
execution
;
you
are
a
*NL*
lawyer
;
you
know
the
proper
point
.
''
Marius
took
the
pistols
and
put
them
*NL*
in
the
side
pocket
of
his
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
makes
a
lump
that
can
be
seen
,
''
said
the
inspector
.
``
Put
them
in
*NL*
your
trousers
pocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
hid
the
pistols
in
his
trousers
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
pursued
the
inspector
,
``
there
is
not
a
minute
more
to
be
lost
by
*NL*
any
one

What
time
is
it
?
Half-past
two
.
Seven
o'clock
is
the
hour
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
o'clock
,
''
answered
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
plenty
of
time
,
''
said
the
inspector
,
``
but
no
more
than
enough
.
*NL*
Do
n't
forget
anything
that
I
have
said
to
you
.
Bang
.
A
pistol
shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rest
easy
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
Marius
laid
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
on
his
way
out
,
*NL*
the
inspector
called
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
if
you
have
occasion
for
my
services
between
now

You

Javert

CHAPTER
XV
--
JONDRETTE
MAKES
HIS
PURCHASES
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
,
about
three
o'clock
,
Courfeyrac
chanced
to
be
*NL*
passing
along
the
Rue
Mouffetard
in
company
with
Bossuet
.
The
snow
had
*NL*
redoubled
in
violence
,
and
filled
the
air
.
Bossuet
was
just
saying
to
*NL*
Courfeyrac
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
would
say
,
to
see
all
these
snow-flakes
fall
,
that
there
was
a
*NL*
plague
of
white
butterflies
in
heaven
.
''
All
at
once
,
Bossuet
caught
*NL*
sight
of
Marius
coming
up
the
street
towards
the
barrier
with
a
peculiar
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
!
''
said
Bossuet
.
``
There
's
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
``
Do
n't
let
's
speak
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
his
air
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
air
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
the
air
of
a
man
who
is
following
some
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
Bossuet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
see
the
eyes
he
is
making
!
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
the
deuce
is
he
following
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
fine
,
flowery
bonneted
wench
!
He
's
in
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
observed
Bossuet
,
``
I
do
n't
see
any
wench
nor
any
flowery
bonnet
*NL*
in
the
street
.
There
's
not
a
woman
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
took
a
survey
,
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
following
a
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
,
in
fact
,
wearing
a
gray
cap
,
and
whose
gray
beard
could
be
*NL*
distinguished
,
although
they
only
saw
his
back
,
was
walking
along
about
*NL*
twenty
paces
in
advance
of
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
dressed
in
a
great-coat
which
was
perfectly
new
and
too
*NL*
large
for
him
,
and
in
a
frightful
pair
of
trousers
all
hanging
in
rags
*NL*
and
black
with
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
?
''
retorted
Courfeyrac
,
``
he
's
a
poet
.
Poets
are
very
fond
of
wearing
*NL*
the
trousers
of
dealers
in
rabbit
skins
and
the
overcoats
of
peers
of
*NL*
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
see
where
Marius
will
go
,
''
said
Bossuet
;
``
let
's
see
where
the
man
*NL*
is
going
,
let
's
follow
them
,
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bossuet
!
''
exclaimed
Courfeyrac
,
``
eagle
of
Meaux
!
You
are
a
prodigious
*NL*
brute
.
Follow
a
man
who
is
following
another
man
,
indeed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
retraced
their
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
,
in
fact
,
seen
Jondrette
passing
along
the
Rue
Mouffetard
,
*NL*
and
was
spying
on
his
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
walked
straight
ahead
,
without
a
suspicion
that
he
was
already
*NL*
held
by
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
quitted
the
Rue
Mouffetard
,
and
Marius
saw
him
enter
one
of
the
most
*NL*
terrible
hovels
in
the
Rue
Gracieuse
;
he
remained
there
about
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
,
then
returned
to
the
Rue
Mouffetard
.
He
halted
at
*NL*
an
ironmonger
's
shop
,
which
then
stood
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Pierre-Lombard
,
and
a
few
minutes
later
Marius
saw
him
emerge
from
the
*NL*
shop
,
holding
in
his
hand
a
huge
cold
chisel
with
a
white
wood
handle
,
*NL*
which
he
concealed
beneath
his
great-coat
.
At
the
top
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Petit-Gentilly
he
turned
to
the
left
and
proceeded
rapidly
to
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Petit-Banquier
.
The
day
was
declining
;
the
snow
,
which
had
ceased
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
had
just
begun
again
.
Marius
posted
himself
on
the
watch
at
the
*NL*
very
corner
of
the
Rue
du
Petit-Banquier
,
which
was
deserted
,
as
usual
,
*NL*
and
did
not
follow
Jondrette
into
it
.
It
was
lucky
that
he
did
so
,
*NL*
for
,
on
arriving
in
the
vicinity
of
the
wall
where
Marius
had
heard
the
*NL*
long-haired
man
and
the
bearded
man
conversing
,
Jondrette
turned
round
,
*NL*
made
sure
that
no
one
was
following
him
,
did
not
see
him
,
then
sprang
*NL*
across
the
wall
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waste
land
bordered
by
this
wall
communicated
with
the
back
yard
of
*NL*
an
ex-livery
stable-keeper
of
bad
repute
,
who
had
failed
and
who
still
*NL*
kept
a
few
old
single-seated
berlins
under
his
sheds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
thought
that
it
would
be
wise
to
profit
by
Jondrette
's
absence
to
*NL*
return
home
;
moreover
,
it
was
growing
late
;
every
evening
,
Ma'am
Bougon
*NL*
when
she
set
out
for
her
dish-washing
in
town
,
had
a
habit
of
locking
*NL*
the
door
,
which
was
always
closed
at
dusk
.
Marius
had
given
his
key
to
*NL*
the
inspector
of
police
;
it
was
important
,
therefore
,
that
he
should
*NL*
make
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
had
arrived
,
night
had
almost
closed
in
;
on
the
horizon
and
in
*NL*
the
immensity
of
space
,
there
remained
but
one
spot
illuminated
by
the
*NL*
sun
,
and
that
was
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
rising
in
a
ruddy
glow
behind
the
low
dome
of
Salpetriere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
returned
to
No.
50-52
with
great
strides
.
The
door
was
still
open
*NL*
when
he
arrived
.
He
mounted
the
stairs
on
tip-toe
and
glided
along
the
*NL*
wall
of
the
corridor
to
his
chamber
.
This
corridor
,
as
the
reader
will
*NL*
remember
,
was
bordered
on
both
sides
by
attics
,
all
of
which
were
,
for
*NL*
the
moment
,
empty
and
to
let
.
Ma'am
Bougon
was
in
the
habit
of
leaving
*NL*
all
the
doors
open
.
As
he
passed
one
of
these
attics
,
Marius
thought
*NL*
he
perceived
in
the
uninhabited
cell
the
motionless
heads
of
four
men
,
*NL*
vaguely
lighted
up
by
a
remnant
of
daylight
,
falling
through
a
dormer
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
made
no
attempt
to
see
,
not
wishing
to
be
seen
himself
.
He
*NL*
succeeded
in
reaching
his
chamber
without
being
seen
and
without
making
*NL*
any
noise
.
It
was
high
time
.
A
moment
later
he
heard
Ma'am
Bougon
take
*NL*
her
departure
,
locking
the
door
of
the
house
behind
her
.

CHAPTER
XVI
--
IN
WHICH
WILL
BE
FOUND
THE
WORDS
TO
AN
ENGLISH
AIR
WHICH
*NL*
WAS
IN
FASHION
IN
1832
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
seated
himself
on
his
bed
.
It
might
have
been
half-past
five
*NL*
o'clock
.
Only
half
an
hour
separated
him
from
what
was
about
to
happen
.
*NL*
He
heard
the
beating
of
his
arteries
as
one
hears
the
ticking
of
a
watch
*NL*
in
the
dark
.
He
thought
of
the
double
march
which
was
going
on
at
that
*NL*
moment
in
the
dark
,
--
crime
advancing
on
one
side
,
justice
coming
up
on
*NL*
the
other
.
He
was
not
afraid
,
but
he
could
not
think
without
a
shudder
*NL*
of
what
was
about
to
take
place
.
As
is
the
case
with
all
those
who
are
*NL*
suddenly
assailed
by
an
unforeseen
adventure
,
the
entire
day
produced
*NL*
upon
him
the
effect
of
a
dream
,
and
in
order
to
persuade
himself
that
he
*NL*
was
not
the
prey
of
a
nightmare
,
he
had
to
feel
the
cold
barrels
of
the
*NL*
steel
pistols
in
his
trousers
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
longer
snowing
;
the
moon
disengaged
itself
more
and
more
*NL*
clearly
from
the
mist
,
and
its
light
,
mingled
with
the
white
reflection
*NL*
of
the
snow
which
had
fallen
,
communicated
to
the
chamber
a
sort
of
*NL*
twilight
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
light
in
the
Jondrette
den
.
Marius
saw
the
hole
in
the
wall
*NL*
shining
with
a
reddish
glow
which
seemed
bloody
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
true
that
the
light
could
not
be
produced
by
a
candle
.
However
,
*NL*
there
was
not
a
sound
in
the
Jondrette
quarters
,
not
a
soul
was
moving
*NL*
there
,
not
a
soul
speaking
,
not
a
breath
;
the
silence
was
glacial
and
*NL*
profound
,
and
had
it
not
been
for
that
light
,
he
might
have
thought
*NL*
himself
next
door
to
a
sepulchre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
softly
removed
his
boots
and
pushed
them
under
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
minutes
elapsed
.
Marius
heard
the
lower
door
turn
on
its
hinges
;
*NL*
a
heavy
step
mounted
the
staircase
,
and
hastened
along
the
corridor
;
the
*NL*
latch
of
the
hovel
was
noisily
lifted
;
it
was
Jondrette
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
,
several
voices
arose
.
The
whole
family
was
in
the
garret
.
*NL*
Only
,
it
had
been
silent
in
the
master
's
absence
,
like
wolf
whelps
in
*NL*
the
absence
of
the
wolf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
I
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
daddy
,
''
yelped
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
's
going
first-rate
,
''
responded
Jondrette
,
``
but
my
feet
are
beastly
*NL*
cold
.
Good
!
You
have
dressed
up
.
You
have
done
well
!
You
must
inspire
*NL*
confidence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
ready
to
go
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
forget
what
I
told
you
.
You
will
do
everything
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rest
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
--
''
said
Jondrette
.
And
he
left
the
phrase
unfinished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
heard
him
lay
something
heavy
on
the
table
,
probably
the
chisel
*NL*
which
he
had
purchased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
said
Jondrette
,
``
have
you
been
eating
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
mother
.
``
I
got
three
large
potatoes
and
some
salt
.
I
*NL*
took
advantage
of
the
fire
to
cook
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
returned
Jondrette
.
``
To-morrow
I
will
take
you
out
to
dine
with
*NL*
me
.
We
will
have
a
duck
and
fixings
.
You
shall
dine
like
Charles
the
*NL*
Tenth
;
all
is
going
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mouse-trap
is
open
.
The
cats
are
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
lowered
his
voice
still
further
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
this
in
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
heard
a
sound
of
charcoal
being
knocked
with
the
tongs
or
some
*NL*
iron
utensil
,
and
Jondrette
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
greased
the
hinges
of
the
door
so
that
they
will
not
squeak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
time
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
six
.
The
half-hour
struck
from
Saint-Medard
a
while
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
ejaculated
Jondrette
;
``
the
children
must
go
and
watch
.
Come
*NL*
you
,
do
you
listen
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
whispering
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
's
voice
became
audible
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
old
Bougon
left
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
that
there
is
no
one
in
our
neighbor
's
room
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
not
been
in
all
day
,
and
you
know
very
well
that
this
is
his
*NL*
dinner
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
''
said
Jondrette
,
``
there
's
no
harm
in
going
to
see
whether
*NL*
he
is
there
.
Here
,
my
girl
,
take
the
candle
and
go
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
fell
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
crawled
silently
under
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
he
concealed
himself
,
when
he
perceived
a
light
through
the
*NL*
crack
of
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
P'pa
,
''
cried
a
voice
,
``
he
is
not
in
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
recognized
the
voice
of
the
eldest
daughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
go
in
?
''
demanded
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
the
girl
,
``
but
as
his
key
is
in
the
door
,
he
must
be
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
in
,
nevertheless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
Marius
saw
the
tall
Jondrette
come
in
with
a
candle
*NL*
in
her
hand
.
She
was
as
she
had
been
in
the
morning
,
only
still
more
*NL*
repulsive
in
this
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
straight
up
to
the
bed
.
Marius
endured
an
indescribable
*NL*
moment
of
anxiety
;
but
near
the
bed
there
was
a
mirror
nailed
to
the
*NL*
wall
,
and
it
was
thither
that
she
was
directing
her
steps
.
She
raised
*NL*
herself
on
tiptoe
and
looked
at
herself
in
it
.
In
the
neighboring
room
,
*NL*
the
sound
of
iron
articles
being
moved
was
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smoothed
her
hair
with
the
palm
of
her
hand
,
and
smiled
into
the
*NL*
mirror
,
humming
with
her
cracked
and
sepulchral
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Nos
amours
ont
dure
toute
une
semaine
,
-LSB-

-RSB-
*NL*
Mais
que
du

*NL*
S'adorer

*NL*
Le

des

durer
toujours
!
*NL*
Devrait
durer
toujours
!
devrait
durer
toujours
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Marius
trembled
.
It
seemed
impossible
to
him
that
she
*NL*
should
not
hear
his
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stepped
to
the
window
and
looked
out
with
the
half-foolish
way
she
*NL*
had
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
ugly
Paris
is
when
it
has
put
on
a
white
chemise
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
to
the
mirror
and
began
again
to
put
on
airs
before
it
,
*NL*
scrutinizing
herself
full-face
and
three-quarters
face
in
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
cried
her
father
,
``
what
are
you
about
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
looking
under
the
bed
and
the
furniture
,
''
she
replied
,
continuing
*NL*
to
arrange
her
hair
;
``
there
's
no
one
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Booby
!
''
yelled
her
father
.
``
Come
here
this
minute
!
And
do
n't
waste
any
*NL*
time
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coming
!
Coming
!
''
said
she
.
``
One
has
no
time
for
anything
in
this
*NL*
hovel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hummed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Vous
me
quittez
pour
aller
a
la
gloire
;
-LSB-
29
-RSB-
*NL*
Mon
triste
coeur
suivra
partout
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
cast
a
parting
glance
in
the
mirror
and
went
out
,
shutting
the
door
*NL*
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
more
,
and
Marius
heard
the
sound
of
the
two
young
girls
'
bare
*NL*
feet
in
the
corridor
,
and
Jondrette
's
voice
shouting
to
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pay
strict
heed
!
One
on
the
side
of
the
barrier
,
the
other
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
Rue
du
Petit-Banquier
.
Do
n't
lose
sight
for
a
moment
of
*NL*
the
door
of
this
house
,
and
the
moment
you
see
anything
,
rush
here
on
*NL*
the
instant
!
as
hard
as
you
can
go
!
You
have
a
key
to
get
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
eldest
girl
grumbled
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
of
standing
watch
in
the
snow
barefoot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
you
shall
have
some
dainty
little
green
silk
boots
!
''
said
the
*NL*
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ran
down
stairs
,
and
a
few
seconds
later
the
shock
of
the
outer
*NL*
door
as
it
banged
to
announced
that
they
were
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
now
remained
in
the
house
only
Marius
,
the
Jondrettes
and
*NL*
probably
,
also
,
the
mysterious
persons
of
whom
Marius
had
caught
a
*NL*
glimpse
in
the
twilight
,
behind
the
door
of
the
unused
attic
.

CHAPTER
XVII
--
THE
USE
MADE
OF
MARIUS
'
FIVE-FRANC
PIECE
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
decided
that
the
moment
had
now
arrived
when
he
must
resume
his
*NL*
post
at
his
observatory
.
In
a
twinkling
,
and
with
the
agility
of
his
*NL*
age
,
he
had
reached
the
hole
in
the
partition
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
of
the
Jondrette
apartment
presented
a
curious
aspect
,
and
*NL*
Marius
found
an
explanation
of
the
singular
light
which
he
had
noticed
.
*NL*
A
candle
was
burning
in
a
candlestick
covered
with
verdigris
,
but
*NL*
that
was
not
what
really
lighted
the
chamber
.
The
hovel
was
completely
*NL*
illuminated
,
as
it
were
,
by
the
reflection
from
a
rather
large
*NL*
sheet-iron
brazier
standing
in
the
fireplace
,
and
filled
with
burning
*NL*
charcoal
,
the
brazier
prepared
by
the
Jondrette
woman
that
morning
.
The
*NL*
charcoal
was
glowing
hot
and
the
brazier
was
red
;
a
blue
flame
flickered
*NL*
over
it
,
and
helped
him
to
make
out
the
form
of
the
chisel
purchased
by
*NL*
Jondrette
in
the
Rue
Pierre-Lombard
,
where
it
had
been
thrust
into
the
*NL*
brazier
to
heat
.
In
one
corner
,
near
the
door
,
and
as
though
prepared
*NL*
for
some
definite
use
,
two
heaps
were
visible
,
which
appeared
to
be
,
the
*NL*
one
a
heap
of
old
iron
,
the
other
a
heap
of
ropes
.
All
this
would
have
*NL*
caused
the
mind
of
a
person
who
knew
nothing
of
what
was
in
preparation
,
*NL*
to
waver
between
a
very
sinister
and
a
very
simple
idea
.
The
lair
thus
*NL*
lighted
up
more
resembled
a
forge
than
a
mouth
of
hell
,
but
Jondrette
,
*NL*
in
this
light
,
had
rather
the
air
of
a
demon
than
of
a
smith
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
heat
of
the
brazier
was
so
great
,
that
the
candle
on
the
table
was
*NL*
melting
on
the
side
next
the
chafing-dish
,
and
was
drooping
over
.
An
old
*NL*
dark-lantern
of
copper
,
worthy
of
Diogenes
turned
Cartouche
,
stood
on
*NL*
the
chimney-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brazier
,
placed
in
the
fireplace
itself
,
beside
the
nearly
extinct
*NL*
brands
,
sent
its
vapors
up
the
chimney
,
and
gave
out
no
odor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
,
entering
through
the
four
panes
of
the
window
,
cast
its
*NL*
whiteness
into
the
crimson
and
flaming
garret
;
and
to
the
poetic
spirit
*NL*
of
Marius
,
who
was
dreamy
even
in
the
moment
of
action
,
it
was
like
a
*NL*
thought
of
heaven
mingled
with
the
misshapen
reveries
of
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
breath
of
air
which
made
its
way
in
through
the
open
pane
,
helped
to
*NL*
dissipate
the
smell
of
the
charcoal
and
to
conceal
the
presence
of
the
*NL*
brazier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jondrette
lair
was
,
if
the
reader
recalls
what
we
have
said
of
the
*NL*
Gorbeau
building
,
admirably
chosen
to
serve
as
the
theatre
of
a
violent
*NL*
and
sombre
deed
,
and
as
the
envelope
for
a
crime
.
It
was
the
most
*NL*
retired
chamber
in
the
most
isolated
house
on
the
most
deserted
*NL*
boulevard
in
Paris
.
If
the
system
of
ambush
and
traps
had
not
already
*NL*
existed
,
they
would
have
been
invented
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
thickness
of
a
house
and
a
multitude
of
uninhabited
rooms
*NL*
separated
this
den
from
the
boulevard
,
and
the
only
window
that
existed
*NL*
opened
on
waste
lands
enclosed
with
walls
and
palisades
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
had
lighted
his
pipe
,
seated
himself
on
the
seatless
chair
,
*NL*
and
was
engaged
in
smoking
.
His
wife
was
talking
to
him
in
a
low
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Marius
had
been
Courfeyrac
,
that
is
to
say
,
one
of
those
men
who
*NL*
laugh
on
every
occasion
in
life
,
he
would
have
burst
with
laughter
when
*NL*
his
gaze
fell
on
the
Jondrette
woman
.
She
had
on
a
black
bonnet
with
*NL*
plumes
not
unlike
the
hats
of
the
heralds-at-arms
at
the
coronation
of
*NL*
Charles
X.
,
an
immense
tartan
shawl
over
her
knitted
petticoat
,
and
the
*NL*
man
's
shoes
which
her
daughter
had
scorned
in
the
morning
.
It
was
this
*NL*
toilette
which
had
extracted
from
Jondrette
the
exclamation
:
``
Good
!
You
*NL*
have
dressed
up
.
You
have
done
well
.
You
must
inspire
confidence
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jondrette
,
he
had
not
taken
off
the
new
surtout
,
which
was
too
*NL*
large
for
him
,
and
which
M.
Leblanc
had
given
him
,
and
his
costume
*NL*
continued
to
present
that
contrast
of
coat
and
trousers
which
*NL*
constituted
the
ideal
of
a
poet
in
Courfeyrac
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
Jondrette
lifted
up
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
!
Now
that
I
think
of
it
.
In
this
weather
,
he
will
come
in
a
*NL*
carriage
.
Light
the
lantern
,
take
it
and
go
down
stairs
.
You
will
stand
*NL*
behind
the
lower
door
.
The
very
moment
that
you
hear
the
carriage
stop
,
*NL*
you
will
open
the
door
,
instantly
,
he
will
come
up
,
you
will
light
the
*NL*
staircase
and
the
corridor
,
and
when
he
enters
here
,
you
will
go
down
*NL*
stairs
again
as
speedily
as
possible
,
you
will
pay
the
coachman
,
and
*NL*
dismiss
the
fiacre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
money
?
''
inquired
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
fumbled
in
his
trousers
pocket
and
handed
her
five
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
replied
with
dignity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
monarch
which
our
neighbor
gave
us
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
?
Two
chairs
will
be
needed
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
sit
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
felt
a
cold
chill
pass
through
his
limbs
at
hearing
this
mild
*NL*
answer
from
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardieu
!
I
'll
go
and
get
one
of
our
neighbor
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
rapid
movement
,
she
opened
the
door
of
the
den
,
and
went
out
*NL*
into
the
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
absolutely
had
not
the
time
to
descend
from
the
commode
,
reach
*NL*
his
bed
,
and
conceal
himself
beneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
candle
,
''
cried
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
would
embarrass
me
,
I
have
the
two
chairs
to
carry
.
*NL*
There
is
moonlight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
heard
Mother
Jondrette
's
heavy
hand
fumbling
at
his
lock
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
The
door
opened
.
He
remained
nailed
to
the
spot
with
the
shock
and
*NL*
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jondrette
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dormer
window
permitted
the
entrance
of
a
ray
of
moonlight
between
*NL*
two
blocks
of
shadow
.
One
of
these
blocks
of
shadow
entirely
covered
the
*NL*
wall
against
which
Marius
was
leaning
,
so
that
he
disappeared
within
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Jondrette
raised
her
eyes
,
did
not
see
Marius
,
took
the
two
*NL*
chairs
,
the
only
ones
which
Marius
possessed
,
and
went
away
,
letting
the
*NL*
door
fall
heavily
to
behind
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
re-entered
the
lair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
the
two
chairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
here
is
the
lantern
.
Go
down
as
quick
as
you
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hastily
obeyed
,
and
Jondrette
was
left
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
the
two
chairs
on
opposite
sides
of
the
table
,
turned
the
*NL*
chisel
in
the
brazier
,
set
in
front
of
the
fireplace
an
old
screen
which
*NL*
masked
the
chafing-dish
,
then
went
to
the
corner
where
lay
the
pile
*NL*
of
rope
,
and
bent
down
as
though
to
examine
something
.
Marius
then
*NL*
recognized
the
fact
,
that
what
he
had
taken
for
a
shapeless
mass
was
a
*NL*
very
well-made
rope-ladder
,
with
wooden
rungs
and
two
hooks
with
which
*NL*
to
attach
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
ladder
,
and
some
large
tools
,
veritable
masses
of
iron
,
which
were
*NL*
mingled
with
the
old
iron
piled
up
behind
the
door
,
had
not
been
in
the
*NL*
Jondrette
hovel
in
the
morning
,
and
had
evidently
been
brought
thither
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
,
during
Marius
'
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
are
the
utensils
of
an
edge-tool
maker
,
''
thought
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Marius
been
a
little
more
learned
in
this
line
,
he
would
have
*NL*
recognized
in
what
he
took
for
the
engines
of
an
edge-tool
maker
,
*NL*
certain
instruments
which
will
force
a
lock
or
pick
a
lock
,
and
others
*NL*
which
will
cut
or
slice
,
the
two
families
of
tools
which
burglars
call
*NL*
cadets
and
fauchants
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fireplace
and
the
two
chairs
were
exactly
opposite
Marius
.
The
*NL*
brazier
being
concealed
,
the
only
light
in
the
room
was
now
furnished
*NL*
by
the
candle
;
the
smallest
bit
of
crockery
on
the
table
or
on
the
*NL*
chimney-piece
cast
a
large
shadow
.
There
was
something
indescribably
*NL*
calm
,
threatening
,
and
hideous
about
this
chamber
.
One
felt
that
there
*NL*
existed
in
it
the
anticipation
of
something
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
had
allowed
his
pipe
to
go
out
,
a
serious
sign
of
*NL*
preoccupation
,
and
had
again
seated
himself
.
The
candle
brought
out
the
*NL*
fierce
and
the
fine
angles
of
his
countenance
.
He
indulged
in
scowls
and
*NL*
in
abrupt
unfoldings
of
the
right
hand
,
as
though
he
were
responding
to
*NL*
the
last
counsels
of
a
sombre
inward
monologue
.
In
the
course
of
one
of
*NL*
these
dark
replies
which
he
was
making
to
himself
,
he
pulled
the
table
*NL*
drawer
rapidly
towards
him
,
took
out
a
long
kitchen
knife
which
was
*NL*
concealed
there
,
and
tried
the
edge
of
its
blade
on
his
nail
.
That
done
,
*NL*
he
put
the
knife
back
in
the
drawer
and
shut
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
on
his
side
,
grasped
the
pistol
in
his
right
pocket
,
drew
it
out
*NL*
and
cocked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pistol
emitted
a
sharp
,
clear
click
,
as
he
cocked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
started
,
half
rose
,
listened
a
moment
,
then
began
to
laugh
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fool
I
am
!
It
's
the
partition
cracking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
kept
the
pistol
in
his
hand
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
--
MARIUS
'
TWO
CHAIRS
FORM
A
VIS-A-VIS
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
the
distant
and
melancholy
vibration
of
a
clock
shook
the
*NL*
panes
.
Six
o'clock
was
striking
from
Saint-Medard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
marked
off
each
stroke
with
a
toss
of
his
head
.
When
the
sixth
*NL*
had
struck
,
he
snuffed
the
candle
with
his
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
room
,
listened
at
the
corridor
,
*NL*
walked
on
again
,
then
listened
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Provided
only
that
he
comes
!
''
he
muttered
,
then
he
returned
to
his
*NL*
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
reseated
himself
when
the
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Jondrette
had
opened
it
,
and
now
remained
in
the
corridor
making
*NL*
a
horrible
,
amiable
grimace
,
which
one
of
the
holes
of
the
dark-lantern
*NL*
illuminated
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enter
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enter
,
my
benefactor
,
''
repeated
Jondrette
,
rising
hastily
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
made
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wore
an
air
of
serenity
which
rendered
him
singularly
venerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
four
louis
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Fabantou
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
is
for
your
rent
and
your
most
*NL*
pressing
necessities
.
We
will
attend
to
the
rest
hereafter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
God
requite
it
to
you
,
my
generous
benefactor
!
''
said
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
rapidly
approaching
his
wife
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dismiss
the
carriage
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
slipped
out
while
her
husband
was
lavishing
salutes
and
offering
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
a
chair
.
An
instant
later
she
returned
and
whispered
in
his
*NL*
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
snow
,
which
had
not
ceased
falling
since
the
morning
,
was
so
deep
*NL*
that
the
arrival
of
the
fiacre
had
not
been
audible
,
and
they
did
not
*NL*
now
hear
its
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
M.
Leblanc
had
seated
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
had
taken
possession
of
the
other
chair
,
facing
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
order
to
form
an
idea
of
the
scene
which
is
to
follow
,
let
the
*NL*
reader
picture
to
himself
in
his
own
mind
,
a
cold
night
,
the
solitudes
*NL*
of
the
Salpetriere
covered
with
snow
and
white
as
winding-sheets
in
*NL*
the
moonlight
,
the
taper-like
lights
of
the
street
lanterns
which
shone
*NL*
redly
here
and
there
along
those
tragic
boulevards
,
and
the
long
rows
*NL*
of
black
elms
,
not
a
passer-by
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
league
around
,
*NL*
the
Gorbeau
hovel
,
at
its
highest
pitch
of
silence
,
of
horror
,
and
of
*NL*
darkness
;
in
that
building
,
in
the
midst
of
those
solitudes
,
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
that
darkness
,
the
vast
Jondrette
garret
lighted
by
a
single
*NL*
candle
,
and
in
that
den
two
men
seated
at
a
table
,
M.
Leblanc
tranquil
,
*NL*
Jondrette
smiling
and
alarming
,
the
Jondrette
woman
,
the
female
wolf
,
*NL*
in
one
corner
,
and
,
behind
the
partition
,
Marius
,
invisible
,
erect
,
not
*NL*
losing
a
word
,
not
missing
a
single
movement
,
his
eye
on
the
watch
,
and
*NL*
pistol
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Marius
experienced
only
an
emotion
of
horror
,
but
no
fear
.
He
*NL*
clasped
the
stock
of
the
pistol
firmly
and
felt
reassured
.
``
I
shall
be
*NL*
able
to
stop
that
wretch
whenever
I
please
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
the
police
were
there
somewhere
in
ambuscade
,
waiting
for
*NL*
the
signal
agreed
upon
and
ready
to
stretch
out
their
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
was
in
hopes
,
that
this
violent
encounter
between
Jondrette
*NL*
and
M.
Leblanc
would
cast
some
light
on
all
the
things
which
he
was
*NL*
interested
in
learning
.

CHAPTER
XIX
--
OCCUPYING
ONE
'S
SELF
WITH
OBSCURE
DEPTHS
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
was
M.
Leblanc
seated
,
when
he
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
*NL*
pallets
,
which
were
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
poor
little
wounded
girl
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
,
''
replied
Jondrette
with
a
heart-broken
and
grateful
smile
,
``
very
*NL*
bad
,
my
worthy
sir
.
Her
elder
sister
has
taken
her
to
the
Bourbe
to
*NL*
have
her
hurt
dressed
.
You
will
see
them
presently
;
they
will
be
back
*NL*
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
Fabantou
seems
to
me
to
be
better
,
''
went
on
M.
Leblanc
,
casting
*NL*
his
eyes
on
the
eccentric
costume
of
the
Jondrette
woman
,
as
she
stood
*NL*
between
him
and
the
door
,
as
though
already
guarding
the
exit
,
and
gazed
*NL*
at
him
in
an
attitude
of
menace
and
almost
of
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
dying
,
''
said
Jondrette
.
``
But
what
do
you
expect
,
sir
!
She
has
so
*NL*
much
courage
,
that
woman
has
!
She
's
not
a
woman
,
she
's
an
ox
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jondrette
,
touched
by
his
compliment
,
deprecated
it
with
the
*NL*
affected
airs
of
a
flattered
monster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
always
too
good
to
me
,
Monsieur
Jondrette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jondrette
!
''
said
M.
Leblanc
,
``
I
thought
your
name
was
Fabantou
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fabantou
,
alias
Jondrette
!
''
replied
the
husband
hurriedly
.
``
An
artistic
*NL*
sobriquet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
launching
at
his
wife
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
which
M.
Leblanc
did
*NL*
not
catch
,
he
continued
with
an
emphatic
and
caressing
inflection
of
*NL*
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
we
have
had
a
happy
life
together
,
this
poor
darling
and
I
!
What
*NL*
would
there
be
left
for
us
if
we
had
not
that
?
We
are
so
wretched
,
my
*NL*
respectable
sir
!
We
have
arms
,
but
there
is
no
work
!
We
have
the
will
,
*NL*
no
work
!
I
do
n't
know
how
the
government
arranges
that
,
but
,
on
my
word
*NL*
of
honor
,
sir
,
I
am
not
Jacobin
,
sir
,
I
am
not
a
bousingot
.
-LSB-
30
-RSB-
I
do
n't
*NL*
wish
them
any
evil
,
but
if
I
were
the
ministers
,
on
my
most
sacred
word
,
*NL*
things
would
be
different
.
Here
,
for
instance
,
I
wanted
to
have
my
*NL*
girls
taught
the
trade
of
paper-box
makers
.
You
will
say
to
me
:
`
What
!
*NL*
a
trade
?
'
Yes
!
A
trade
!
A
simple
trade
!
A
bread-winner
!
What
a
fall
,
*NL*
my
benefactor
!
What
a
degradation
,
when
one
has
been
what
we
have
been
!
*NL*
Alas
!
There
is
nothing
left
to
us
of
our
days
of
prosperity
!
One
thing
*NL*
only
,
a
picture
,
of
which
I
think
a
great
deal
,
but
which
I
am
willing
*NL*
to
part
with
,
for
I
must
live
!
Item
,
one
must
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Jondrette
thus
talked
,
with
an
apparent
incoherence
which
*NL*
detracted
nothing
from
the
thoughtful
and
sagacious
expression
of
his
*NL*
physiognomy
,
Marius
raised
his
eyes
,
and
perceived
at
the
other
end
of
*NL*
the
room
a
person
whom
he
had
not
seen
before
.
A
man
had
just
entered
,
*NL*
so
softly
that
the
door
had
not
been
heard
to
turn
on
its
hinges
.
This
*NL*
man
wore
a
violet
knitted
vest
,
which
was
old
,
worn
,
spotted
,
cut
and
*NL*
gaping
at
every
fold
,
wide
trousers
of
cotton
velvet
,
wooden
shoes
on
*NL*
his
feet
,
no
shirt
,
had
his
neck
bare
,
his
bare
arms
tattooed
,
and
his
*NL*
face
smeared
with
black
.
He
had
seated
himself
in
silence
on
the
nearest
*NL*
bed
,
and
,
as
he
was
behind
Jondrette
,
he
could
only
be
indistinctly
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
sort
of
magnetic
instinct
which
turns
aside
the
gaze
,
caused
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
to
turn
round
almost
at
the
same
moment
as
Marius
.
He
could
not
*NL*
refrain
from
a
gesture
of
surprise
which
did
not
escape
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
see
!
''
exclaimed
Jondrette
,
buttoning
up
his
coat
with
an
air
of
*NL*
complaisance
,
``
you
are
looking
at
your
overcoat
?
It
fits
me
!
My
faith
,
*NL*
but
it
fits
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
that
man
?
''
said
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Him
?
''
ejaculated
Jondrette
,
``
he
's
a
neighbor
of
mine
.
Do
n't
pay
any
*NL*
attention
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbor
was
a
singular-looking
individual
.
However
,
manufactories
*NL*
of
chemical
products
abound
in
the
Faubourg
Saint-Marceau
.
Many
of
the
*NL*
workmen
might
have
black
faces
.
Besides
this
,
M.
Leblanc
's
whole
person
*NL*
was
expressive
of
candid
and
intrepid
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
;
what
were
you
saying
,
M.
Fabantou
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
telling
you
,
sir
,
and
dear
protector
,
''
replied
Jondrette
placing
*NL*
his
elbows
on
the
table
and
contemplating
M.
Leblanc
with
steady
and
*NL*
tender
eyes
,
not
unlike
the
eyes
of
the
boa-constrictor
,
``
I
was
telling
*NL*
you
,
that
I
have
a
picture
to
sell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
slight
sound
came
from
the
door
.
A
second
man
had
just
entered
and
*NL*
seated
himself
on
the
bed
,
behind
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
the
first
,
his
arms
were
bare
,
and
he
had
a
mask
of
ink
or
*NL*
lampblack
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
this
man
had
,
literally
,
glided
into
the
room
,
he
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
prevent
M.
Leblanc
catching
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
them
,
''
said
Jondrette
,
``
they
are
people
who
belong
in
the
*NL*
house
.
So
I
was
saying
,
that
there
remains
in
my
possession
a
valuable
*NL*
picture
.
But
stop
,
sir
,
take
a
look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
went
to
the
wall
at
the
foot
of
which
stood
the
panel
which
we
*NL*
have
already
mentioned
,
and
turned
it
round
,
still
leaving
it
supported
*NL*
against
the
wall
.
It
really
was
something
which
resembled
a
picture
,
and
*NL*
which
the
candle
illuminated
,
somewhat
.
Marius
could
make
nothing
out
of
*NL*
it
,
as
Jondrette
stood
between
the
picture
and
him
;
he
only
saw
a
coarse
*NL*
daub
,
and
a
sort
of
principal
personage
colored
with
the
harsh
crudity
*NL*
of
foreign
canvasses
and
screen
paintings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
painting
by
a
master
,
a
picture
of
great
value
,
my
benefactor
!
I
am
*NL*
as
much
attached
to
it
as
I
am
to
my
two
daughters
;
it
recalls
souvenirs
*NL*
to
me
!
But
I
have
told
you
,
and
I
will
not
take
it
back
,
that
I
am
so
*NL*
wretched
that
I
will
part
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Either
by
chance
,
or
because
he
had
begun
to
feel
a
dawning
uneasiness
,
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
's
glance
returned
to
the
bottom
of
the
room
as
he
examined
*NL*
the
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
now
four
men
,
three
seated
on
the
bed
,
one
standing
near
the
*NL*
door-post
,
all
four
with
bare
arms
and
motionless
,
with
faces
smeared
*NL*
with
black
.
One
of
those
on
the
bed
was
leaning
against
the
wall
,
with
*NL*
closed
eyes
,
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
he
was
asleep
.
He
*NL*
was
old
;
his
white
hair
contrasting
with
his
blackened
face
produced
a
*NL*
horrible
effect
.
The
other
two
seemed
to
be
young
;
one
wore
a
beard
,
the
*NL*
other
wore
his
hair
long
.
None
of
them
had
on
shoes
;
those
who
did
not
*NL*
wear
socks
were
barefooted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
noticed
that
M.
Leblanc
's
eye
was
fixed
on
these
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
friends
.
They
are
neighbors
,
''
said
he
.
``
Their
faces
are
black
*NL*
because
they
work
in
charcoal
.
They
are
chimney-builders
.
Do
n't
trouble
*NL*
yourself
about
them
,
my
benefactor
,
but
buy
my
picture
.
Have
pity
on
*NL*
my
misery
.
I
will
not
ask
you
much
for
it
.
How
much
do
you
think
it
is
*NL*
worth
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
M.
Leblanc
,
looking
Jondrette
full
in
the
eye
,
and
with
the
*NL*
manner
of
a
man
who
is
on
his
guard
,
``
it
is
some
signboard
for
a
tavern
,
*NL*
and
is
worth
about
three
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
replied
sweetly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
your
pocket-book
with
you
?
I
should
be
satisfied
with
a
*NL*
thousand
crowns
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
sprang
up
,
placed
his
back
against
the
wall
,
and
cast
a
rapid
*NL*
glance
around
the
room
.
He
had
Jondrette
on
his
left
,
on
the
side
next
*NL*
the
window
,
and
the
Jondrette
woman
and
the
four
men
on
his
right
,
on
*NL*
the
side
next
the
door
.
The
four
men
did
not
stir
,
and
did
not
even
seem
*NL*
to
be
looking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
had
again
begun
to
speak
in
a
plaintive
tone
,
with
so
vague
*NL*
an
eye
,
and
so
lamentable
an
intonation
,
that
M.
Leblanc
might
have
*NL*
supposed
that
what
he
had
before
him
was
a
man
who
had
simply
gone
mad
*NL*
with
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
not
buy
my
picture
,
my
dear
benefactor
,
''
said
Jondrette
,
``
I
*NL*
shall
be
left
without
resources
;
there
will
be
nothing
left
for
me
but
*NL*
to
throw
myself
into
the
river
.
When
I
think
that
I
wanted
to
have
my
*NL*
two
girls
taught
the
middle-class
paper-box
trade
,
the
making
of
boxes
*NL*
for
New
Year
's
gifts
!
Well
!
A
table
with
a
board
at
the
end
to
keep
the
*NL*
glasses
from
falling
off
is
required
,
then
a
special
stove
is
needed
,
a
*NL*
pot
with
three
compartments
for
the
different
degrees
of
strength
of
*NL*
the
paste
,
according
as
it
is
to
be
used
for
wood
,
paper
,
or
stuff
,
a
*NL*
paring-knife
to
cut
the
cardboard
,
a
mould
to
adjust
it
,
a
hammer
to
*NL*
nail
the
steels
,
pincers
,
how
the
devil
do
I
know
what
all
?
And
all
that
*NL*
in
order
to
earn
four
sous
a
day
!
And
you
have
to
work
fourteen
hours
a
*NL*
day
!
And
each
box
passes
through
the
workwoman
's
hands
thirteen
times
!
*NL*
And
you
ca
n't
wet
the
paper
!
And
you
must
n't
spot
anything
!
And
you
must
*NL*
keep
the
paste
hot
.
The
devil
,
I
tell
you
!
Four
sous
a
day
!
How
do
you
*NL*
suppose
a
man
is
to
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
Jondrette
did
not
look
at
M.
Leblanc
,
who
was
observing
*NL*
him
.
M.
Leblanc
's
eye
was
fixed
on
Jondrette
,
and
Jondrette
's
eye
was
*NL*
fixed
on
the
door
.
Marius
'
eager
attention
was
transferred
from
one
*NL*
to
the
other
.
M.
Leblanc
seemed
to
be
asking
himself
:
``
Is
this
man
an
*NL*
idiot
?
''
Jondrette
repeated
two
or
three
distinct
times
,
with
all
manner
*NL*
of
varying
inflections
of
the
whining
and
supplicating
order
:
``
There
*NL*
is
nothing
left
for
me
but
to
throw
myself
into
the
river
!
I
went
down
*NL*
three
steps
at
the
side
of
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
the
other
day
for
*NL*
that
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
his
dull
eyes
lighted
up
with
a
hideous
flash
;
the
little
*NL*
man
drew
himself
up
and
became
terrible
,
took
a
step
toward
M.
Leblanc
*NL*
and
cried
in
a
voice
of
thunder
:
``
That
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
*NL*
question
!
Do
you
know
me
?

CHAPTER
XX
--
THE
TRAP
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
garret
had
just
opened
abruptly
,
and
allowed
a
view
of
*NL*
three
men
clad
in
blue
linen
blouses
,
and
masked
with
masks
of
black
*NL*
paper
.
The
first
was
thin
,
and
had
a
long
,
iron-tipped
cudgel
;
the
*NL*
second
,
who
was
a
sort
of
colossus
,
carried
,
by
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
handle
,
with
the
blade
downward
,
a
butcher
's
pole-axe
for
slaughtering
*NL*
cattle
.
The
third
,
a
man
with
thick-set
shoulders
,
not
so
slender
as
*NL*
the
first
,
held
in
his
hand
an
enormous
key
stolen
from
the
door
of
some
*NL*
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
the
arrival
of
these
men
was
what
Jondrette
had
been
*NL*
waiting
for
.
A
rapid
dialogue
ensued
between
him
and
the
man
with
the
*NL*
cudgel
,
the
thin
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
everything
ready
?
''
said
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
the
thin
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Montparnasse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
principal
actor
stopped
to
chat
with
your
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
eldest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
carriage
at
the
door
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
team
harnessed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
two
good
horses
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
waiting
where
I
ordered
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
said
Jondrette
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
was
very
pale
.
He
was
scrutinizing
everything
around
him
in
*NL*
the
den
,
like
a
man
who
understands
what
he
has
fallen
into
,
and
his
*NL*
head
,
directed
in
turn
toward
all
the
heads
which
surrounded
him
,
moved
*NL*
on
his
neck
with
an
astonished
and
attentive
slowness
,
but
there
*NL*
was
nothing
in
his
air
which
resembled
fear
.
He
had
improvised
*NL*
an
intrenchment
out
of
the
table
;
and
the
man
,
who
but
an
instant
*NL*
previously
,
had
borne
merely
the
appearance
of
a
kindly
old
man
,
had
*NL*
suddenly
become
a
sort
of
athlete
,
and
placed
his
robust
fist
on
the
*NL*
back
of
his
chair
,
with
a
formidable
and
surprising
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
old
man
,
who
was
so
firm
and
so
brave
in
the
presence
of
such
a
*NL*
danger
,
seemed
to
possess
one
of
those
natures
which
are
as
courageous
*NL*
as
they
are
kind
,
both
easily
and
simply
.
The
father
of
a
woman
whom
we
*NL*
love
is
never
a
stranger
to
us
.
Marius
felt
proud
of
that
unknown
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
of
the
men
,
of
whom
Jondrette
had
said
:
``
They
are
*NL*
chimney-builders
,
''
had
armed
themselves
from
the
pile
of
old
iron
,
one
*NL*
with
a
heavy
pair
of
shears
,
the
second
with
weighing-tongs
,
the
third
*NL*
with
a
hammer
,
and
had
placed
themselves
across
the
entrance
without
*NL*
uttering
a
syllable
.
The
old
man
had
remained
on
the
bed
,
and
had
merely
*NL*
opened
his
eyes
.
The
Jondrette
woman
had
seated
herself
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
decided
that
in
a
few
seconds
more
the
moment
for
intervention
*NL*
would
arrive
,
and
he
raised
his
right
hand
towards
the
ceiling
,
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
corridor
,
in
readiness
to
discharge
his
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jondrette
having
terminated
his
colloquy
with
the
man
with
the
cudgel
,
*NL*
turned
once
more
to
M.
Leblanc
,
and
repeated
his
question
,
accompanying
*NL*
it
with
that
low
,
repressed
,
and
terrible
laugh
which
was
peculiar
to
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
not
recognize
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
looked
him
full
in
the
face
,
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Jondrette
advanced
to
the
table
.
He
leaned
across
the
candle
,
*NL*
crossing
his
arms
,
putting
his
angular
and
ferocious
jaw
close
to
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
's
calm
face
,
and
advancing
as
far
as
possible
without
forcing
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
to
retreat
,
and
,
in
this
posture
of
a
wild
beast
who
is
about
to
*NL*
bite
,
he
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
not
Fabantou
,
my
name
is
not
Jondrette
,
my
name
is
*NL*
Thenardier
.
I
am
the
inn-keeper
of
Montfermeil
!
Do
you
understand
?
*NL*
Thenardier
!
Now
do
you
know
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
almost
imperceptible
flush
crossed
M.
Leblanc
's
brow
,
and
he
replied
*NL*
with
a
voice
which
neither
trembled
nor
rose
above
its
ordinary
level
,
*NL*
with
his
accustomed
placidity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
than
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
did
not
hear
this
reply
.
Any
one
who
had
seen
him
at
that
moment
*NL*
through
the
darkness
would
have
perceived
that
he
was
haggard
,
*NL*
stupid
,
thunder-struck
.
At
the
moment
when
Jondrette
said
:
``
My
name
is
*NL*
Thenardier
,
''
Marius
had
trembled
in
every
limb
,
and
had
leaned
against
*NL*
the
wall
,
as
though
he
felt
the
cold
of
a
steel
blade
through
his
heart
.
*NL*
Then
his
right
arm
,
all
ready
to
discharge
the
signal
shot
,
dropped
*NL*
slowly
,
and
at
the
moment
when
Jondrette
repeated
,
``
Thenardier
,
do
you
*NL*
understand
?
''
Marius
's
faltering
fingers
had
come
near
letting
the
pistol
*NL*
fall
.
Jondrette
,
by
revealing
his
identity
,
had
not
moved
M.
Leblanc
,
*NL*
but
he
had
quite
upset
Marius
.
That
name
of
Thenardier
,
with
which
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
did
not
seem
to
be
acquainted
,
Marius
knew
well
.
Let
the
reader
*NL*
recall
what
that
name
meant
to
him
!
That
name
he
had
worn
on
his
heart
,
*NL*
inscribed
in
his
father
's
testament
!
He
bore
it
at
the
bottom
of
his
*NL*
mind
,
in
the
depths
of
his
memory
,
in
that
sacred
injunction
:
``
A
certain
*NL*
Thenardier
saved
my
life
.
If
my
son
encounters
him
,
he
will
do
him
all
*NL*
the
good
that
lies
in
his
power
.
''
That
name
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
*NL*
was
one
of
the
pieties
of
his
soul
;
he
mingled
it
with
the
name
of
*NL*
his
father
in
his
worship
.
What
!
This
man
was
that
Thenardier
,
that
*NL*
inn-keeper
of
Montfermeil
whom
he
had
so
long
and
so
vainly
sought
!
He
*NL*
had
found
him
at
last
,
and
how
?
His
father
's
saviour
was
a
ruffian
!
*NL*
That
man
,
to
whose
service
Marius
was
burning
to
devote
himself
,
was
*NL*
a
monster
!
That
liberator
of
Colonel
Pontmercy
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
committing
a
crime
whose
scope
Marius
did
not
,
as
yet
,
clearly
*NL*
comprehend
,
but
which
resembled
an
assassination
!
And
against
whom
,
*NL*
great
God
!
what
a
fatality
!
What
a
bitter
mockery
of
fate
!
His
father
*NL*
had
commanded
him
from
the
depths
of
his
coffin
to
do
all
the
good
in
*NL*
his
power
to
this
Thenardier
,
and
for
four
years
Marius
had
cherished
*NL*
no
other
thought
than
to
acquit
this
debt
of
his
father
's
,
and
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
on
the
eve
of
having
a
brigand
seized
in
the
very
*NL*
act
of
crime
by
justice
,
destiny
cried
to
him
:
``
This
is
Thenardier
!
''
*NL*
He
could
at
last
repay
this
man
for
his
father
's
life
,
saved
amid
a
*NL*
hail-storm
of
grape-shot
on
the
heroic
field
of
Waterloo
,
and
repay
it
*NL*
with
the
scaffold
!
He
had
sworn
to
himself
that
if
ever
he
found
that
*NL*
Thenardier
,
he
would
address
him
only
by
throwing
himself
at
his
feet
;
*NL*
and
now
he
actually
had
found
him
,
but
it
was
only
to
deliver
him
over
*NL*
to
the
executioner
!
His
father
said
to
him
:
``
Succor
Thenardier
!
''
And
he
*NL*
replied
to
that
adored
and
sainted
voice
by
crushing
Thenardier
!
He
was
*NL*
about
to
offer
to
his
father
in
his
grave
the
spectacle
of
that
man
who
*NL*
had
torn
him
from
death
at
the
peril
of
his
own
life
,
executed
on
the
*NL*
Place
Saint-Jacques
through
the
means
of
his
son
,
of
that
Marius
to
whom
*NL*
he
had
entrusted
that
man
by
his
will
!
And
what
a
mockery
to
have
so
*NL*
long
worn
on
his
breast
his
father
's
last
commands
,
written
in
his
own
*NL*
hand
,
only
to
act
in
so
horribly
contrary
a
sense
!
But
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
,
now
look
on
that
trap
and
not
prevent
it
!
Condemn
the
victim
and
*NL*
to
spare
the
assassin
!
Could
one
be
held
to
any
gratitude
towards
so
*NL*
miserable
a
wretch
?
All
the
ideas
which
Marius
had
cherished
for
the
*NL*
last
four
years
were
pierced
through
and
through
,
as
it
were
,
by
this
*NL*
unforeseen
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shuddered
.
Everything
depended
on
him
.
Unknown
to
themselves
,
he
*NL*
held
in
his
hand
all
those
beings
who
were
moving
about
there
before
his
*NL*
eyes
.
If
he
fired
his
pistol
,
M.
Leblanc
was
saved
,
and
Thenardier
lost
;
*NL*
if
he
did
not
fire
,
M.
Leblanc
would
be
sacrificed
,
and
,
who
knows
?
*NL*
Thenardier
would
escape
.
Should
he
dash
down
the
one
or
allow
the
other
*NL*
to
fall
?
Remorse
awaited
him
in
either
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
?
What
should
he
choose
?
Be
false
to
the
most
imperious
*NL*
souvenirs
,
to
all
those
solemn
vows
to
himself
,
to
the
most
sacred
duty
,
*NL*
to
the
most
venerated
text
!
Should
he
ignore
his
father
's
testament
,
*NL*
or
allow
the
perpetration
of
a
crime
!
On
the
one
hand
,
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
he
heard
``
his
Ursule
''
supplicating
for
her
father
and
on
the
other
,
*NL*
the
colonel
commending
Thenardier
to
his
care
.
He
felt
that
he
was
going
*NL*
mad
.
His
knees
gave
way
beneath
him
.
And
he
had
not
even
the
time
for
*NL*
deliberation
,
so
great
was
the
fury
with
which
the
scene
before
his
eyes
*NL*
was
hastening
to
its
catastrophe
.
It
was
like
a
whirlwind
of
which
he
*NL*
had
thought
himself
the
master
,
and
which
was
now
sweeping
him
away
.
He
*NL*
was
on
the
verge
of
swooning
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Thenardier
,
whom
we
shall
henceforth
call
by
no
other
*NL*
name
,
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
front
of
the
table
in
a
sort
of
frenzy
*NL*
and
wild
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
the
candle
in
his
fist
,
and
set
it
on
the
chimney-piece
with
*NL*
so
violent
a
bang
that
the
wick
came
near
being
extinguished
,
and
the
*NL*
tallow
bespattered
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
to
M.
Leblanc
with
a
horrible
look
,
and
spit
out
these
*NL*
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Done
for
!
Smoked
brown
!
Cooked
!
Spitchcocked
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
he
began
to
march
back
and
forth
,
in
full
eruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
cried
,
``
so
I
've
found
you
again
at
last
,
Mister
philanthropist
!
*NL*
Mister
threadbare
millionnaire
!
Mister
giver
of
dolls
!
you
old
*NL*
ninny
!
Ah
!
so
you
do
n't
recognize
me
!
No
,
it
was
n't
you
who
came
to
*NL*
Montfermeil
,
to
my
inn
,
eight
years
ago
,
on
Christmas
eve
,
1823
!
It
*NL*
was
n't
you
who
carried
off
that
Fantine
's
child
from
me
!
The
Lark
!
It
*NL*
was
n't
you
who
had
a
yellow
great-coat
!
No
!
Nor
a
package
of
duds
in
*NL*
your
hand
,
as
you
had
this
morning
here
!
Say
,
wife
,
it
seems
to
be
his
*NL*
mania
to
carry
packets
of
woollen
stockings
into
houses
!
Old
charity
*NL*
monger
,
get
out
with
you
!
Are
you
a
hosier
,
Mister
millionnaire
?
You
*NL*
give
away
your
stock
in
trade
to
the
poor
,
holy
man
!
What
bosh
!
merry
*NL*
Andrew
!
Ah
!
and
you
do
n't
recognize
me
?
Well
,
I
recognize
you
,
that
I
*NL*
do
!
I
recognized
you
the
very
moment
you
poked
your
snout
in
here
.
Ah
!
*NL*
you
'll
find
out
presently
,
that
it
is
n't
all
roses
to
thrust
yourself
*NL*
in
that
fashion
into
people
's
houses
,
under
the
pretext
that
they
are
*NL*
taverns
,
in
wretched
clothes
,
with
the
air
of
a
poor
man
,
to
whom
one
*NL*
would
give
a
sou
,
to
deceive
persons
,
to
play
the
generous
,
to
take
away
*NL*
their
means
of
livelihood
,
and
to
make
threats
in
the
woods
,
and
you
*NL*
ca
n't
call
things
quits
because
afterwards
,
when
people
are
ruined
,
you
*NL*
bring
a
coat
that
is
too
large
,
and
two
miserable
hospital
blankets
,
you
*NL*
old
blackguard
,
you
child-stealer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
seemed
to
be
talking
to
himself
for
a
moment
.
One
would
*NL*
have
said
that
his
wrath
had
fallen
into
some
hole
,
like
the
Rhone
;
*NL*
then
,
as
though
he
were
concluding
aloud
the
things
which
he
had
been
*NL*
saying
to
himself
in
a
whisper
,
he
smote
the
table
with
his
fist
,
and
*NL*
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
with
his
goody-goody
air
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
apostrophizing
M.
Leblanc
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parbleu
!
You
made
game
of
me
in
the
past
!
You
are
the
cause
of
all
my
*NL*
misfortunes
!
For
fifteen
hundred
francs
you
got
a
girl
whom
I
had
,
and
*NL*
who
certainly
belonged
to
rich
people
,
and
who
had
already
brought
in
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
money
,
and
from
whom
I
might
have
extracted
enough
to
live
*NL*
on
all
my
life
!
A
girl
who
would
have
made
up
to
me
for
everything
that
*NL*
I
lost
in
that
vile
cook-shop
,
where
there
was
nothing
but
one
continual
*NL*
row
,
and
where
,
like
a
fool
,
I
ate
up
my
last
farthing
!
Oh
!
I
wish
all
*NL*
the
wine
folks
drank
in
my
house
had
been
poison
to
those
who
drank
it
!
*NL*
Well
,
never
mind
!
Say
,
now
!
You
must
have
thought
me
ridiculous
when
you
*NL*
went
off
with
the
Lark
!
You
had
your
cudgel
in
the
forest
.
You
were
the
*NL*
stronger

Revenge
.
I
'm
the
one
to
hold
the
trumps
to-day
!
You
're
in
a
*NL*
sorry
case
,
my
good
fellow
!
Oh
,
but
I
can
laugh
!
Really
,
I
laugh
!
Did
n't
*NL*
he
fall
into
the
trap
!
I
told
him
that
I
was
an
actor
,
that
my
name
was
*NL*
Fabantou
,
that
I
had
played
comedy
with
Mamselle
Mars
,
with
Mamselle
*NL*
Muche
,
that
my
landlord
insisted
on
being
paid
tomorrow
,
the
4th
of
*NL*
February
,
and
he
did
n't
even
notice
that
the
8th
of
January
,
and
not
the
*NL*
4th
of
February
is
the
time
when
the
quarter
runs
out
!
Absurd
idiot
!
*NL*
And
the
four
miserable
Philippes
which
he
has
brought
me
!
Scoundrel
!
*NL*
He
had
n't
the
heart
even
to
go
as
high
as
a
hundred
francs
!
And
how
*NL*
he
swallowed
my
platitudes
!
That
did
amuse
me
.
I
said
to
myself
:
*NL*
`
Blockhead
!
Come
,
I
've
got
you
!
I
lick
your
paws
this
morning
,
but
I
'll
*NL*
gnaw
your
heart
this
evening
!

''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
paused
.
He
was
out
of
breath
.
His
little
,
narrow
chest
panted
*NL*
like
a
forge
bellows
.
His
eyes
were
full
of
the
ignoble
happiness
of
a
*NL*
feeble
,
cruel
,
and
cowardly
creature
,
which
finds
that
it
can
,
at
last
,
*NL*
harass
what
it
has
feared
,
and
insult
what
it
has
flattered
,
the
joy
of
*NL*
a
dwarf
who
should
be
able
to
set
his
heel
on
the
head
of
Goliath
,
the
*NL*
joy
of
a
jackal
which
is
beginning
to
rend
a
sick
bull
,
so
nearly
dead
*NL*
that
he
can
no
longer
defend
himself
,
but
sufficiently
alive
to
suffer
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
did
not
interrupt
him
,
but
said
to
him
when
he
paused
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you

You

poor
man
,
and
anything
but
a
millionnaire

I
do
not
know
you

You
are
*NL*
mistaking
me
for
some
other
person

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

roared
Thenardier
hoarsely
,
``
a
pretty
lie

You

You

Ah

You

You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me

''
said
M.
Leblanc
with
a
politeness
of
accent
,
which
at
*NL*
that
moment
seemed
peculiarly
strange
and
powerful
,
``
I
see
that
you
are
*NL*
a
villain

*NL*
*NL*
Who
has
not
remarked
the
fact
that
odious
creatures
possess
a
*NL*
susceptibility
of
their
own
,
that
monsters
are
ticklish
!
At
this
word
*NL*
``
villain
,
''
the
female
Thenardier
sprang
from
the
bed
,
Thenardier
grasped
*NL*
his
chair
as
though
he
were
about
to
crush
it
in
his
hands
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
stir

''
he
shouted
to
his
wife
;
and
,
turning
to
M.
Leblanc
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

Yes

warm
your

you

forty

the
month

and
green
peas

you
gorge
yourselves

when

you
want
to
know
whether
it
is
cold
,
you
look
in
the
papers
to
see
what
*NL*
the
engineer
Chevalier
's
thermometer
says
about
it
.
We
,
it
is
we
who
are
*NL*
thermometers

We
do
n't
need
to
go
out
and
look
on
the
quay
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
Tour
de
l'Horologe
,
to
find
out
the
number
of
degrees
of
cold

*NL*
we
feel
our
blood
congealing
in

veins

and
the
ice
forming
round
our

and
we
say
:

And
you
come
to

yes
*NL*
our
caverns

for

But
we

But

Just
see
here

Mister

millionnaire
:
I
have
been
a
solid

I

held
a
license

I

And
it
's
quite
possible

that

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Thenardier
took
a
step
towards
the
men
who
stood
near
the
door
,
and
*NL*
added
with
a
shudder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
I
think
that
he
has
dared
to
come
here
and
talk
to
me
like
a
*NL*
cobbler
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
addressing
M.
Leblanc
with
a
fresh
outburst
of
frenzy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
listen
to
this
also
,
Mister
philanthropist
!
I
'm
not
a
suspicious
*NL*
character
,
not
a
bit
of
it
!
I
'm
not
a
man
whose
name
nobody
knows
,
and
*NL*
who
comes
and
abducts
children
from
houses
!
I
'm
an
old
French
soldier
,
*NL*
I
ought
to
have
been
decorated
!
I
was
at
Waterloo
,
so
I
was
!
And
in
the
*NL*
battle
I
saved
a
general
called
the
Comte
of
I
do
n't
know
what
.
He
told
*NL*
me
his
name
,
but
his
beastly
voice
was
so
weak
that
I
did
n't
hear
.
All
I
*NL*
caught
was
Merci
-LSB-
thanks
-RSB-
.
I
'd
rather
have
had
his
name
than
his
thanks
.
*NL*
That
would
have
helped
me
to
find
him
again

The
picture
that
you
see
*NL*
here
,
and
which
was
painted
by
David
at
Bruqueselles
,
--
do
you
know
what
*NL*
it
represents
?
It
represents
me
.
David
wished
to
immortalize
that
*NL*
feat
of
prowess
.
I
have
that
general
on
my
back
,
and
I
am
carrying
him
*NL*
through
the
grape-shot
.
There
's
the
history
of
it
!
That
general
never
*NL*
did
a
single
thing
for
me
;
he
was
no
better
than
the
rest
!
But
none
the
*NL*
less
,
I
saved
his
life
at
the
risk
of
my
own
,
and
I
have
the
certificate

And
now

I
have
had

tell
you
all

let
's
have

I
must
have
an
enormous

exterminate

*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
regained
some
measure
of
control
over
his
anguish
,
and
was
*NL*
listening
.
The
last
possibility
of
doubt
had
just
vanished
.
It
certainly
*NL*
was
the
Thenardier
of
the
will
.
Marius
shuddered
at
that
reproach
of
*NL*
ingratitude
directed
against
his
father
,
and
which
he
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
so
fatally
justifying
.
His
perplexity
was
redoubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
there
was
in
all
these
words
of
Thenardier
,
in
his
accent
,
in
*NL*
his
gesture
,
in
his
glance
which
darted
flames
at
every
word
,
there
*NL*
was
,
in
this
explosion
of
an
evil
nature
disclosing
everything
,
in
that
*NL*
mixture
of
braggadocio
and
abjectness
,
of
pride
and
pettiness
,
of
rage
*NL*
and
folly
,
in
that
chaos
of
real
griefs
and
false
sentiments
,
in
*NL*
that
immodesty
of
a
malicious
man
tasting
the
voluptuous
delights
*NL*
of
violence
,
in
that
shameless
nudity
of
a
repulsive
soul
,
in
that
*NL*
conflagration
of
all
sufferings
combined
with
all
hatreds
,
something
*NL*
which
was
as
hideous
as
evil
,
and
as
heart-rending
as
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
picture
of
the
master
,
the
painting
by
David
which
he
had
proposed
*NL*
that
M.
Leblanc
should
purchase
,
was
nothing
else
,
as
the
reader
has
*NL*
divined
,
than
the
sign
of
his
tavern
painted
,
as
it
will
be
remembered
,
*NL*
by
himself
,
the
only
relic
which
he
had
preserved
from
his
shipwreck
at
*NL*
Montfermeil
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
ceased
to
intercept
Marius
'
visual
ray
,
Marius
could
examine
*NL*
this
thing
,
and
in
the
daub
,
he
actually
did
recognize
a
battle
,
a
*NL*
background
of
smoke
,
and
a
man
carrying
another
man
.
It
was
the
group
*NL*
composed
of
Pontmercy
and
Thenardier
;
the
sergeant
the
rescuer
,
the
*NL*
colonel
rescued
.
Marius
was
like
a
drunken
man
;
this
picture
restored
*NL*
his
father
to
life
in
some
sort
;
it
was
no
longer
the
signboard
of
the
*NL*
wine-shop
at
Montfermeil
,
it
was
a
resurrection
;
a
tomb
had
yawned
,
a
*NL*
phantom
had
risen
there
.
Marius
heard
his
heart
beating
in
his
temples
,
*NL*
he
had
the
cannon
of
Waterloo
in
his
ears
,
his
bleeding
father
,
vaguely
*NL*
depicted
on
that
sinister
panel
terrified
him
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
the
misshapen
spectre
was
gazing
intently
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Thenardier
had
recovered
his
breath
,
he
turned
his
bloodshot
eyes
*NL*
on
M.
Leblanc
,
and
said
to
him
in
a
low
,
curt
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
say
before
we
put
the
handcuffs
on
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
held
his
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
silence
,
a
cracked
voice
launched
this
lugubrious
*NL*
sarcasm
from
the
corridor
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
's
any
wood
to
be
split
,
I
'm
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
man
with
the
axe
,
who
was
growing
merry
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
an
enormous
,
bristling
,
and
clayey
face
made
its
*NL*
appearance
at
the
door
,
with
a
hideous
laugh
which
exhibited
not
teeth
,
*NL*
but
fangs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
face
of
the
man
with
the
butcher
's
axe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
have
you
taken
off
your
mask
?
''
cried
Thenardier
in
a
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
fun
,
''
retorted
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
few
minutes
M.
Leblanc
had
appeared
to
be
watching
and
*NL*
following
all
the
movements
of
Thenardier
,
who
,
blinded
and
dazzled
by
*NL*
his
own
rage
,
was
stalking
to
and
fro
in
the
den
with
full
confidence
*NL*
that
the
door
was
guarded
,
and
of
holding
an
unarmed
man
fast
,
he
being
*NL*
armed
himself
,
of
being
nine
against
one
,
supposing
that
the
female
*NL*
Thenardier
counted
for
but
one
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
his
address
to
the
man
with
the
pole-axe
,
he
had
turned
his
back
*NL*
to
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
seized
this
moment
,
overturned
the
chair
with
his
foot
and
*NL*
the
table
with
his
fist
,
and
with
one
bound
,
with
prodigious
agility
,
*NL*
before
Thenardier
had
time
to
turn
round
,
he
had
reached
the
window
.
To
*NL*
open
it
,
to
scale
the
frame
,
to
bestride
it
,
was
the
work
of
a
second
*NL*
only
.
He
was
half
out
when
six
robust
fists
seized
him
and
dragged
*NL*
him
back
energetically
into
the
hovel
.
These
were
the
three
*NL*
``
chimney-builders
,
''
who
had
flung
themselves
upon
him
.
At
the
same
time
*NL*
the
Thenardier
woman
had
wound
her
hands
in
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
trampling
which
ensued
,
the
other
ruffians
rushed
up
from
the
*NL*
corridor
.
The
old
man
on
the
bed
,
who
seemed
under
the
influence
*NL*
of
wine
,
descended
from
the
pallet
and
came
reeling
up
,
with
a
*NL*
stone-breaker
's
hammer
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
``
chimney-builders
,
''
whose
smirched
face
was
lighted
up
by
*NL*
the
candle
,
and
in
whom
Marius
recognized
,
in
spite
of
his
daubing
,
*NL*
Panchaud
,
alias
Printanier
,
alias
Bigrenaille
,
lifted
above
M.
Leblanc
's
*NL*
head
a
sort
of
bludgeon
made
of
two
balls
of
lead
,
at
the
two
ends
of
a
*NL*
bar
of
iron
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
could
not
resist
this
sight
.
``
My
father
,
''
he
thought
,
``
forgive
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
finger
sought
the
trigger
of
his
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shot
was
on
the
point
of
being
discharged
when
Thenardier
's
voice
*NL*
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
harm
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
desperate
attempt
of
the
victim
,
far
from
exasperating
Thenardier
,
*NL*
had
calmed
him
.
There
existed
in
him
two
men
,
the
ferocious
man
and
*NL*
the
adroit
man
.
Up
to
that
moment
,
in
the
excess
of
his
triumph
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
prey
which
had
been
brought
down
,
and
which
did
not
*NL*
stir
,
the
ferocious
man
had
prevailed
;
when
the
victim
struggled
and
*NL*
tried
to
resist
,
the
adroit
man
reappeared
and
took
the
upper
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
hurt
him
!
''
he
repeated
,
and
without
suspecting
it
,
his
first
*NL*
success
was
to
arrest
the
pistol
in
the
act
of
being
discharged
,
and
to
*NL*
paralyze
Marius
,
in
whose
opinion
the
urgency
of
the
case
disappeared
,
*NL*
and
who
,
in
the
face
of
this
new
phase
,
saw
no
inconvenience
in
waiting
*NL*
a
while
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
knows
whether
some
chance
would
not
arise
which
would
deliver
him
*NL*
from
the
horrible
alternative
of
allowing
Ursule
's
father
to
perish
,
or
*NL*
of
destroying
the
colonel
's
saviour
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
herculean
struggle
had
begun
.
With
one
blow
full
in
the
chest
,
M.
*NL*
Leblanc
had
sent
the
old
man
tumbling
,
rolling
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
,
then
with
two
backward
sweeps
of
his
hand
he
had
overthrown
two
*NL*
more
assailants
,
and
he
held
one
under
each
of
his
knees
;
the
wretches
*NL*
were
rattling
in
the
throat
beneath
this
pressure
as
under
a
granite
*NL*
millstone
;
but
the
other
four
had
seized
the
formidable
old
man
by
both
*NL*
arms
and
the
back
of
his
neck
,
and
were
holding
him
doubled
up
over
the
*NL*
two
``
chimney-builders
''
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
the
master
of
some
and
mastered
by
the
rest
,
crushing
those
*NL*
beneath
him
and
stifling
under
those
on
top
of
him
,
endeavoring
in
vain
*NL*
to
shake
off
all
the
efforts
which
were
heaped
upon
him
,
M.
Leblanc
*NL*
disappeared
under
the
horrible
group
of
ruffians
like
the
wild
boar
*NL*
beneath
a
howling
pile
of
dogs
and
hounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
succeeded
in
overthrowing
him
upon
the
bed
nearest
the
window
,
and
*NL*
there
they
held
him
in
awe
.
The
Thenardier
woman
had
not
released
her
*NL*
clutch
on
his
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
mix
yourself
up
in
this
affair
,
''
said
Thenardier
.
``
You
'll
*NL*
tear
your
shawl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
obeyed
,
as
the
female
wolf
obeys
the
male
wolf
,
with
a
*NL*
growl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Thenardier
,
``
search
him
,
you
other
fellows
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
seemed
to
have
renounced
the
idea
of
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
searched
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
nothing
on
his
person
except
a
leather
purse
containing
six
*NL*
francs
,
and
his
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
put
the
handkerchief
into
his
own
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
No
pocket-book
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nor
watch
,
''
replied
one
of
the
``
chimney-builders
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
,
''
murmured
the
masked
man
who
carried
the
big
key
,
in
the
*NL*
voice
of
a
ventriloquist
,
``
he
's
a
tough
old
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
went
to
the
corner
near
the
door
,
picked
up
a
bundle
of
ropes
*NL*
and
threw
them
at
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tie
him
to
the
leg
of
the
bed
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
catching
sight
of
the
old
man
who
had
been
stretched
across
the
*NL*
room
by
the
blow
from
M.
Leblanc
's
fist
,
and
who
made
no
movement
,
he
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Boulatruelle
dead
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Bigrenaille
,
``
he
's
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweep
him
into
a
corner
,
''
said
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
``
chimney-builders
''
pushed
the
drunken
man
into
the
corner
*NL*
near
the
heap
of
old
iron
with
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Babet
,
''
said
Thenardier
in
a
low
tone
to
the
man
with
the
cudgel
,
``
why
*NL*
did
you
bring
so
many
;
they
were
not
needed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
do
?
''
replied
the
man
with
the
cudgel
,
``
they
all
wanted
to
*NL*
be
in
it
.
This
is
a
bad
season
.
There
's
no
business
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pallet
on
which
M.
Leblanc
had
been
thrown
was
a
sort
of
hospital
*NL*
bed
,
elevated
on
four
coarse
wooden
legs
,
roughly
hewn
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
let
them
take
their
own
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ruffians
bound
him
securely
,
in
an
upright
attitude
,
with
his
feet
*NL*
on
the
ground
at
the
head
of
the
bed
,
the
end
which
was
most
remote
from
*NL*
the
window
,
and
nearest
to
the
fireplace
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
last
knot
had
been
tied
,
Thenardier
took
a
chair
and
seated
*NL*
himself
almost
facing
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
no
longer
looked
like
himself
;
in
the
course
of
a
few
moments
*NL*
his
face
had
passed
from
unbridled
violence
to
tranquil
and
cunning
*NL*
sweetness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
found
it
difficult
to
recognize
in
that
polished
smile
of
a
man
*NL*
in
official
life
the
almost
bestial
mouth
which
had
been
foaming
but
a
*NL*
moment
before
;
he
gazed
with
amazement
on
that
fantastic
and
alarming
*NL*
metamorphosis
,
and
he
felt
as
a
man
might
feel
who
should
behold
a
tiger
*NL*
converted
into
a
lawyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
--
''
said
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
dismissing
with
a
gesture
the
ruffians
who
still
kept
their
hands
on
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
off
a
little
,
and
let
me
have
a
talk
with
the
gentleman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
retired
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
you
did
wrong
to
try
to
jump
out
of
the
window
.
You
might
*NL*
have
broken
your
leg
.
Now
,
if
you
will
permit
me
,
we
will
converse
*NL*
quietly
.
In
the
first
place
,
I
must
communicate
to
you
an
observation
*NL*
which
I
have
made
which
is
,
that
you
have
not
uttered
the
faintest
cry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
right
,
this
detail
was
correct
,
although
it
had
escaped
*NL*
Marius
in
his
agitation
.
M.
Leblanc
had
barely
pronounced
a
few
words
,
*NL*
without
raising
his
voice
,
and
even
during
his
struggle
with
the
six
*NL*
ruffians
near
the
window
he
had
preserved
the
most
profound
and
singular
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon
Dieu
!
You
might
have
shouted
`
stop
thief
'
a
bit
,
and
I
should
not
*NL*
have
thought
it
improper
.
`
Murder
!
'
That
,
too
,
is
said
occasionally
,
*NL*
and
,
so
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
should
not
have
taken
it
in
bad
part
.
*NL*
It
is
very
natural
that
you
should
make
a
little
row
when
you
find
*NL*
yourself
with
persons
who
do
n't
inspire
you
with
sufficient
confidence
.
*NL*
You
might
have
done
that
,
and
no
one
would
have
troubled
you
on
that
*NL*
account
.
You
would
not
even
have
been
gagged
.
And
I
will
tell
you
why
.
*NL*
This
room
is
very
private
.
That
's
its
only
recommendation
,
but
it
has
*NL*
that
in
its
favor
.
You
might
fire
off
a
mortar
and
it
would
produce
*NL*
about
as
much
noise
at
the
nearest
police
station
as
the
snores
of
a
*NL*
drunken
man
.
Here
a
cannon
would
make
a
boum
,
and
the
thunder
would
make
*NL*
a
pouf
.
It
's
a
handy
lodging
.
But
,
in
short
,
you
did
not
shout
,
and
*NL*
it
is
better
so
.
I
present
you
my
compliments
,
and
I
will
tell
you
the
*NL*
conclusion
that
I
draw
from
that
fact
:
My
dear
sir
,
when
a
man
shouts
,
*NL*
who
comes
?
The
police
.
And
after
the
police
?
Justice
.
Well
!
You
have
not
*NL*
made
an
outcry
;
that
is
because
you
do
n't
care
to
have
the
police
and
*NL*
the
courts
come
in
any
more
than
we
do
.
It
is
because
,
--
I
have
long
*NL*
suspected
it
,
--
you
have
some
interest
in
hiding
something
.
On
our
side
*NL*
we
have
the
same
interest
.
So
we
can
come
to
an
understanding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
thus
,
it
seemed
as
though
Thenardier
,
who
kept
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
M.
Leblanc
,
were
trying
to
plunge
the
sharp
points
which
darted
*NL*
from
the
pupils
into
the
very
conscience
of
his
prisoner
.
Moreover
,
his
*NL*
language
,
which
was
stamped
with
a
sort
of
moderated
,
subdued
insolence
*NL*
and
crafty
insolence
,
was
reserved
and
almost
choice
,
and
in
that
*NL*
rascal
,
who
had
been
nothing
but
a
robber
a
short
time
previously
,
one
*NL*
now
felt
``
the
man
who
had
studied
for
the
priesthood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
preserved
by
the
prisoner
,
that
precaution
which
had
been
*NL*
carried
to
the
point
of
forgetting
all
anxiety
for
his
own
life
,
that
*NL*
resistance
opposed
to
the
first
impulse
of
nature
,
which
is
to
utter
*NL*
a
cry
,
all
this
,
it
must
be
confessed
,
now
that
his
attention
had
*NL*
been
called
to
it
,
troubled
Marius
,
and
affected
him
with
painful
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
's
well-grounded
observation
still
further
obscured
for
Marius
*NL*
the
dense
mystery
which
enveloped
that
grave
and
singular
person
on
whom
*NL*
Courfeyrac
had
bestowed
the
sobriquet
of
Monsieur
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
whoever
he
was
,
bound
with
ropes
,
surrounded
with
executioners
,
half
*NL*
plunged
,
so
to
speak
,
in
a
grave
which
was
closing
in
upon
him
to
the
*NL*
extent
of
a
degree
with
every
moment
that
passed
,
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
Thenardier
's
wrath
,
as
in
the
presence
of
his
sweetness
,
this
man
*NL*
remained
impassive
;
and
Marius
could
not
refrain
from
admiring
at
such
a
*NL*
moment
the
superbly
melancholy
visage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
evidently
,
was
a
soul
which
was
inaccessible
to
terror
,
and
which
*NL*
did
not
know
the
meaning
of
despair
.
Here
was
one
of
those
men
who
*NL*
command
amazement
in
desperate
circumstances
.
Extreme
as
was
the
crisis
,
*NL*
inevitable
as
was
the
catastrophe
,
there
was
nothing
here
of
the
agony
*NL*
of
the
drowning
man
,
who
opens
his
horror-filled
eyes
under
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
rose
in
an
unpretending
manner
,
went
to
the
fireplace
,
shoved
*NL*
aside
the
screen
,
which
he
leaned
against
the
neighboring
pallet
,
and
*NL*
thus
unmasked
the
brazier
full
of
glowing
coals
,
in
which
the
prisoner
*NL*
could
plainly
see
the
chisel
white-hot
and
spotted
here
and
there
with
*NL*
tiny
scarlet
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Thenardier
returned
to
his
seat
beside
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
continue
,
''
said
he
.
``
We
can
come
to
an
understanding
.
Let
us
arrange
*NL*
this
matter
in
an
amicable
way
.
I
was
wrong
to
lose
my
temper
just
now
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
what
I
was
thinking
of
,
I
went
a
great
deal
too
far
,
I
said
*NL*
extravagant
things
.
For
example
,
because
you
are
a
millionnaire
,
I
told
*NL*
you
that
I
exacted
money
,
a
lot
of
money
,
a
deal
of
money
.
That
would
*NL*
not
be
reasonable
.
Mon
Dieu
,
in
spite
of
your
riches
,
you
have
expenses
*NL*
of
your
own
--
who
has
not
?
I
do
n't
want
to
ruin
you
,
I
am
not
a
greedy
*NL*
fellow
,
after
all
.
I
am
not
one
of
those
people
who
,
because
they
have
*NL*
the
advantage
of
the
position
,
profit
by
the
fact
to
make
themselves
*NL*
ridiculous
.
Why
,
I
'm
taking
things
into
consideration
and
making
a
*NL*
sacrifice
on
my
side
.
I
only
want
two
hundred
thousand
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
uttered
not
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
I
put
not
a
little
water
in
my
wine
;
I
'm
very
moderate
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
the
state
of
your
fortune
,
but
I
do
know
that
you
do
n't
stick
*NL*
at
money
,
and
a
benevolent
man
like
yourself
can
certainly
give
two
*NL*
hundred
thousand
francs
to
the
father
of
a
family
who
is
out
of
luck
.
*NL*
Certainly
,
you
are
reasonable
,
too
;
you
have
n't
imagined
that
I
should
*NL*
take
all
the
trouble
I
have
to-day
and
organized
this
affair
this
*NL*
evening
,
which
has
been
labor
well
bestowed
,
in
the
opinion
of
these
*NL*
gentlemen
,
merely
to
wind
up
by
asking
you
for
enough
to
go
and
drink
*NL*
red
wine
at
fifteen
sous
and
eat
veal
at
Desnoyer
's
.
Two
hundred
*NL*
thousand
francs
--
it
's
surely
worth
all
that
.
This
trifle
once
out
of
*NL*
your
pocket
,
I
guarantee
you
that
that
's
the
end
of
the
matter
,
and
that
*NL*
you
have
no
further
demands
to
fear
.
You
will
say
to
me
:
`
But
I
have
n't
*NL*
two
hundred
thousand
francs
about
me
.
'
Oh
!
I
'm
not
extortionate
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
demand
that
.
I
only
ask
one
thing
of
you
.
Have
the
goodness
to
write
*NL*
what
I
am
about
to
dictate
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Thenardier
paused
;
then
he
added
,
emphasizing
his
words
,
and
*NL*
casting
a
smile
in
the
direction
of
the
brazier
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
warn
you
that
I
shall
not
admit
that
you
do
n't
know
how
to
write
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
grand
inquisitor
might
have
envied
that
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
pushed
the
table
close
to
M.
Leblanc
,
and
took
an
inkstand
,
*NL*
a
pen
,
and
a
sheet
of
paper
from
the
drawer
which
he
left
half
open
,
and
*NL*
in
which
gleamed
the
long
blade
of
the
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
the
sheet
of
paper
before
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Write
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
spoke
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
expect
me
to
write
?
I
am
bound
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
excuse
me
!
''
ejaculated
Thenardier
,
``
you
are
quite
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
to
Bigrenaille
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Untie
the
gentleman
's
right
arm

''
*NL*
*NL*
Panchaud
,
alias
Printanier
,
alias
Bigrenaille
,
executed
Thenardier
's
*NL*
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
prisoner
's
right
arm
was
free
,
Thenardier
dipped
the
pen
in
the
*NL*
ink
and
presented
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Understand
thoroughly

can
get
you
out

that

*NL*
shall
be
really
grieved

are
forced
to
proceed
to
disagreeable

extremities

I
know
neither
your

I
warn
you

that
you
will
remain
bound
until
the
person
charged
with
carrying
the
*NL*
letter

you
are
about

have
returned

Now

be
so
good
*NL*
as
to
write

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
demanded
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
dictate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
took
the
pen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
began
to
dictate
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter

*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
shuddered
,
and
raised
his
eyes
to
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
down
`
My
dear
daughter

--
''
said
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
instantly

*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
address
her
as
thou

do
you
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who

asked
M.
Leblanc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parbleu

''
cried
Thenardier
,
``
the
little
one
,
the
Lark

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
replied
without
the
slightest
apparent
emotion
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
nevertheless

ejaculated
Thenardier
,
and
he
continued
to
*NL*
dictate
:

*NL*
*NL*
``

waiting
for

Come
with
confidence

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
had
written
the
whole
of
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
erase
`
come
with
confidence

;
that
might
lead
her
to
suppose
that
*NL*
everything
was
not
as
it
should
be
,
and
that
distrust
is
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Leblanc
erased
the
three
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

''
pursued
Thenardier
,
``
sign
it

What
's
your
name

*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
laid
down
the
pen
and
demanded
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
For
whom
is
this
letter

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know

retorted
Thenardier
,
``
for
the
little
one
I
just
told
*NL*
you
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
Thenardier
avoided
naming
the
young
girl
in
*NL*
question
.
He
said
``
the
Lark
,
''
he
said
``
the
little
one
,
''
but
he
did
not
*NL*
pronounce
her
name
--
the
precaution
of
a
clever
man
guarding
his
secret
*NL*
from
his
accomplices
.
To
mention
the
name
was
to
deliver
the
whole
*NL*
``
affair
''
into
their
hands
,
and
to
tell
them
more
about
it
than
there
was
*NL*
any
need
of
their
knowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sign

What
is
your
name

*NL*
*NL*
``
Urbain

said
the
prisoner

*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
with
the
movement
of
a
cat
,
dashed
his
hand
into
his
pocket
*NL*
and
drew
out
the
handkerchief
which
had
been
seized
on
M.
Leblanc
.
He
*NL*
looked
for
the
mark
on
it
,
and
held
it
close
to
the
candle

*NL*
*NL*
``

Well

The
prisoner
signed

``
As

thoughtfully
for
a

he
took

Thenardier
seized

feverish
convulsion

``
Yes

the
man

*NL*
*NL*
And
depositing
his
axe
in
a
corner

he
followed
Madame

*NL*
As
they
set
off

Thenardier
thrust
his
head
through
the
half-open
door

shouted
into

corridor

hoarse

replied

cracking

whip
was

heard

rapidly
retreated

died
away

Thenardier

He
drew

close

folding

his
muddy

at
fear

charcoal-burners

had
a
stupid

either
wrath
*NL*
or
mercy
,
with
a
sort
of
ennui
.
They
were
crowded
together
in
one
corner
*NL*
like
brutes
,
and
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
warmed
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
had
relapsed
into
his
taciturnity
.
A
sombre
calm
had
*NL*
succeeded
to
the
wild
uproar
which
had
filled
the
garret
but
a
few
*NL*
moments
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candle
,
on
which
a
large
``
stranger
''
had
formed
,
cast
but
a
dim
*NL*
light
in
the
immense
hovel
,
the
brazier
had
grown
dull
,
and
all
those
*NL*
monstrous
heads
cast
misshapen
shadows
on
the
walls
and
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sound
was
audible
except
the
quiet
breathing
of
the
old
drunken
man
,
*NL*
who
was
fast
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
waited
in
a
state
of
anxiety
that
was
augmented
by
every
trifle
.
*NL*
The
enigma
was
more
impenetrable
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
this
``
little
one
''
whom
Thenardier
had
called
the
Lark
?
Was
she
*NL*
his
``
Ursule
''
?
The
prisoner
had
not
seemed
to
be
affected
by
that
word
,
*NL*
``
the
Lark
,
''
and
had
replied
in
the
most
natural
manner
in
the
world
:
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
what
you
mean
.
''
On
the
other
hand
,
the
two
letters
U.
F.
*NL*
were
explained
;
they
meant
Urbain
Fabre
;
and
Ursule
was
no
longer
named
*NL*
Ursule
.
This
was
what
Marius
perceived
most
clearly
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sort
of
horrible
fascination
held
him
nailed
to
his
post
,
from
which
*NL*
he
was
observing
and
commanding
this
whole
scene
.
There
he
stood
,
*NL*
almost
incapable
of
movement
or
reflection
,
as
though
annihilated
by
the
*NL*
abominable
things
viewed
at
such
close
quarters
.
He
waited
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
some
incident
,
no
matter
of
what
nature
,
since
he
could
not
collect
*NL*
his
thoughts
and
did
not
know
upon
what
course
to
decide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
any
case
,
''
he
said
,
``
if
she
is
the
Lark
,
I
shall
see
her
,
for
the
*NL*
Thenardier
woman
is
to
bring
her
hither
.
That
will
be
the
end
,
and
then
*NL*
I
will
give
my
life
and
my
blood
if
necessary
,
but
I
will
deliver
her
!
*NL*
Nothing
shall
stop
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
half
an
hour
passed
in
this
manner
.
Thenardier
seemed
to
be
*NL*
absorbed
in
gloomy
reflections
,
the
prisoner
did
not
stir
.
Still
,
Marius
*NL*
fancied
that
at
intervals
,
and
for
the
last
few
moments
,
he
had
heard
a
*NL*
faint
,
dull
noise
in
the
direction
of
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
Thenardier
addressed
the
prisoner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Monsieur
Fabre
,
I
might
as
well
say
it
to
you
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
few
words
appeared
to
be
the
beginning
of
an
explanation
.
Marius
*NL*
strained
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
will
be
back
shortly
,
do
n't
get
impatient
.
I
think
that
the
*NL*
Lark
really
is
your
daughter
,
and
it
seems
to
me
quite
natural
that
you
*NL*
should
keep
her
.
Only
,
listen
to
me
a
bit
.
My
wife
will
go
and
hunt
her
*NL*
up
with
your
letter
.
I
told
my
wife
to
dress
herself
in
the
way
she
did
,
*NL*
so
that
your
young
lady
might
make
no
difficulty
about
following
her
.
*NL*
They
will
both
enter
the
carriage
with
my
comrade
behind
.
Somewhere
,
*NL*
outside
the
barrier
,
there
is
a
trap
harnessed
to
two
very
good
horses
.
*NL*
Your
young
lady
will
be
taken
to
it
.
She
will
alight
from
the
fiacre
.
*NL*
My
comrade
will
enter
the
other
vehicle
with
her
,
and
my
wife
will
come
*NL*
back
here
to
tell
us
:
`
It
's
done
.
'
As
for
the
young
lady
,
no
harm
will
*NL*
be
done
to
her
;
the
trap
will
conduct
her
to
a
place
where
she
will
be
*NL*
quiet
,
and
just
as
soon
as
you
have
handed
over
to
me
those
little
two
*NL*
hundred
thousand
francs
,
she
will
be
returned
to
you
.
If
you
have
me
*NL*
arrested
,
my
comrade
will
give
a
turn
of
his
thumb
to
the
Lark
,
that
's
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
uttered
not
a
syllable
.
After
a
pause
,
Thenardier
*NL*
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
simple
,
as
you
see
.
There
'll
be
no
harm
done
unless
you
wish
*NL*
that
there
should
be
harm
done
.
I
'm
telling
you
how
things
stand
.
I
warn
*NL*
you
so
that
you
may
be
prepared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
:
the
prisoner
did
not
break
the
silence
,
and
Thenardier
*NL*
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
my
wife
returns
and
says
to
me
:
`
The
Lark
is
on
the
way
,
'
we
*NL*
will
release
you
,
and
you
will
be
free
to
go
and
sleep
at
home
.
You
see
*NL*
that
our
intentions
are
not
evil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Terrible
images
passed
through
Marius
'
mind
.
What
!
That
young
girl
whom
*NL*
they
were
abducting
was
not
to
be
brought
back
?
One
of
those
monsters
*NL*
was
to
bear
her
off
into
the
darkness
?
Whither
?
And
what
if
it
were
she
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
it
was
she
.
Marius
felt
his
heart
stop
beating
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
?
Discharge
the
pistol
?
Place
all
those
scoundrels
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
justice
?
But
the
horrible
man
with
the
meat-axe
would
,
none
*NL*
the
less
,
be
out
of
reach
with
the
young
girl
,
and
Marius
reflected
on
*NL*
Thenardier
's
words
,
of
which
he
perceived
the
bloody
significance
:
``
If
*NL*
you
have
me
arrested
,
my
comrade
will
give
a
turn
of
his
thumb
to
the
*NL*
Lark
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
was
not
alone
by
the
colonel
's
testament
,
it
was
by
his
own
*NL*
love
,
it
was
by
the
peril
of
the
one
he
loved
,
that
he
felt
himself
*NL*
restrained
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
frightful
situation
,
which
had
already
lasted
above
half
an
hour
,
*NL*
was
changing
its
aspect
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
sufficient
strength
of
mind
to
review
in
succession
all
the
*NL*
most
heart-breaking
conjectures
,
seeking
hope
and
finding
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tumult
of
his
thoughts
contrasted
with
the
funereal
silence
of
the
*NL*
den
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
silence
,
the
door
at
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
*NL*
was
heard
to
open
and
shut
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
made
a
movement
in
his
bonds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
bourgeoise
,
''
said
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
uttered
the
words
,
when
the
Thenardier
woman
did
in
fact
*NL*
rush
hastily
into
the
room
,
red
,
panting
,
breathless
,
with
flaming
eyes
,
*NL*
and
cried
,
as
she
smote
her
huge
hands
on
her
thighs
simultaneously
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
False
address
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ruffian
who
had
gone
with
her
made
his
appearance
behind
her
and
*NL*
picked
up
his
axe
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
there
!
Rue
Saint-Dominique
,
No.
17
,
no
Monsieur
Urbain
Fabre
!
*NL*
They
know
not
what
it
means
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
choking
,
then
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Thenardier
!
That
old
fellow
has
duped
you
!
You
are
too
good
,
*NL*
you
see
!
If
it
had
been
me
,
I
'd
have
chopped
the
beast
in
four
quarters
*NL*
to
begin
with
!
And
if
he
had
acted
ugly
,
I
'd
have
boiled
him
alive
!
He
*NL*
would
have
been
obliged
to
speak
,
and
say
where
the
girl
is
,
and
where
*NL*
he
keeps
his
shiners
!
That
's
the
way
I
should
have
managed
matters
!
*NL*
People
are
perfectly
right
when
they
say
that
men
are
a
deal
stupider
*NL*
than
women
!
Nobody
at
No.
17
.
It
's
nothing
but
a
big
carriage
gate
!
No
*NL*
Monsieur
Fabre
in
the
Rue
Saint-Dominique
!
And
after
all
that
racing
*NL*
and
fee
to
the
coachman
and
all
!
I
spoke
to
both
the
porter
and
the
*NL*
portress
,
a
fine
,
stout
woman
,
and
they
know
nothing
about
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
breathed
freely
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
,
Ursule
or
the
Lark
,
he
no
longer
knew
what
to
call
her
,
was
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
his
exasperated
wife
vociferated
,
Thenardier
had
seated
himself
on
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
minutes
he
uttered
not
a
word
,
but
swung
his
right
foot
,
*NL*
which
hung
down
,
and
stared
at
the
brazier
with
an
air
of
savage
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
he
said
to
the
prisoner
,
with
a
slow
and
singularly
ferocious
*NL*
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
false
address
?
What
did
you
expect
to
gain
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
gain
time
!
''
cried
the
prisoner
in
a
thundering
voice
,
and
at
the
*NL*
same
instant
he
shook
off
his
bonds
;
they
were
cut
.
The
prisoner
was
*NL*
only
attached
to
the
bed
now
by
one
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
seven
men
had
time
to
collect
their
senses
and
dash
forward
,
*NL*
he
had
bent
down
into
the
fireplace
,
had
stretched
out
his
hand
to
the
*NL*
brazier
,
and
had
then
straightened
himself
up
again
,
and
now
Thenardier
,
*NL*
the
female
Thenardier
,
and
the
ruffians
,
huddled
in
amazement
at
the
*NL*
extremity
of
the
hovel
,
stared
at
him
in
stupefaction
,
as
almost
free
*NL*
and
in
a
formidable
attitude
,
he
brandished
above
his
head
the
red-hot
*NL*
chisel
,
which
emitted
a
threatening
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
judicial
examination
to
which
the
ambush
in
the
Gorbeau
house
*NL*
eventually
gave
rise
,
established
the
fact
that
a
large
sou
piece
,
cut
*NL*
and
worked
in
a
peculiar
fashion
,
was
found
in
the
garret
,
when
the
*NL*
police
made
their
descent
on
it
.
This
sou
piece
was
one
of
those
marvels
*NL*
of
industry
,
which
are
engendered
by
the
patience
of
the
galleys
in
*NL*
the
shadows
and
for
the
shadows
,
marvels
which
are
nothing
else
than
*NL*
instruments
of
escape
.
These
hideous
and
delicate
products
of
wonderful
*NL*
art
are
to
jewellers
'
work
what
the
metaphors
of
slang
are
to
poetry
.
*NL*
There
are
Benvenuto
Cellinis
in
the
galleys
,
just
as
there
are
Villons
*NL*
in
language
.
The
unhappy
wretch
who
aspires
to
deliverance
finds
means
*NL*
sometimes
without
tools
,
sometimes
with
a
common
wooden-handled
knife
,
*NL*
to
saw
a
sou
into
two
thin
plates
,
to
hollow
out
these
plates
without
*NL*
affecting
the
coinage
stamp
,
and
to
make
a
furrow
on
the
edge
of
the
sou
*NL*
in
such
a
manner
that
the
plates
will
adhere
again
.
This
can
be
screwed
*NL*
together
and
unscrewed
at
will
;
it
is
a
box
.
In
this
box
he
hides
a
*NL*
watch-spring
,
and
this
watch-spring
,
properly
handled
,
cuts
good-sized
*NL*
chains
and
bars
of
iron
.
The
unfortunate
convict
is
supposed
to
possess
*NL*
merely
a
sou
;
not
at
all
,
he
possesses
liberty
.
It
was
a
large
sou
of
*NL*
this
sort
which
,
during
the
subsequent
search
of
the
police
,
was
found
*NL*
under
the
bed
near
the
window
.
They
also
found
a
tiny
saw
of
blue
steel
*NL*
which
would
fit
the
sou
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
the
prisoner
had
this
sou
piece
on
his
person
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
the
ruffians
searched
him
,
that
he
contrived
to
conceal
*NL*
it
in
his
hand
,
and
that
afterward
,
having
his
right
hand
free
,
he
*NL*
unscrewed
it
,
and
used
it
as
a
saw
to
cut
the
cords
which
fastened
him
,
*NL*
which
would
explain
the
faint
noise
and
almost
imperceptible
movements
*NL*
which
Marius
had
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
not
been
able
to
bend
down
,
for
fear
of
betraying
himself
,
he
*NL*
had
not
cut
the
bonds
of
his
left
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ruffians
had
recovered
from
their
first
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
easy
,
''
said
Bigrenaille
to
Thenardier
.
``
He
still
holds
by
one
leg
,
*NL*
and
he
ca
n't
get
away
.
I
'll
answer
for
that
.
I
tied
that
paw
for
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
prisoner
had
begun
to
speak
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wretches
,
but
my
life
is
not
worth
the
trouble
of
defending
it
.
*NL*
When
you
think
that
you
can
make
me
speak
,
that
you
can
make
me
write
*NL*
what
I
do
not
choose
to
write
,
that
you
can
make
me
say
what
I
do
not
*NL*
choose
to
say
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stripped
up
his
left
sleeve
,
and
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
he
extended
his
arm
,
and
laid
the
glowing
chisel
*NL*
which
he
held
in
his
left
hand
by
its
wooden
handle
on
his
bare
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crackling
of
the
burning
flesh
became
audible
,
and
the
odor
peculiar
*NL*
to
chambers
of
torture
filled
the
hovel
.

*NL*
Marius
reeled
in
utter
horror
,
the
very
ruffians
shuddered
,
hardly
a
*NL*
muscle
of
the
old
man
's
face
contracted
,
and
while
the
red-hot
iron
*NL*
sank
into
the
smoking
wound
,
impassive
and
almost
august
,
he
fixed
on
*NL*
Thenardier
his
beautiful
glance
,
in
which
there
was
no
hatred
,
and
where
*NL*
suffering
vanished
in
serene
majesty
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
grand
and
lofty
natures
,
the
revolts
of
the
flesh
and
the
senses
*NL*
when
subjected
to
physical
suffering
cause
the
soul
to
spring
forth
,
and
*NL*
make
it
appear
on
the
brow
,
just
as
rebellions
among
the
soldiery
force
*NL*
the
captain
to
show
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wretches
!
''
said
he
,
``
have
no
more
fear
of
me
than
I
have
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
tearing
the
chisel
from
the
wound
,
he
hurled
it
through
the
window
,
*NL*
which
had
been
left
open
;
the
horrible
,
glowing
tool
disappeared
into
*NL*
the
night
,
whirling
as
it
flew
,
and
fell
far
away
on
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
what
you
please
with
me
.
''
He
was
disarmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seize
him
!
''
said
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
of
the
ruffians
laid
their
hands
on
his
shoulder
,
and
the
masked
*NL*
man
with
the
ventriloquist
's
voice
took
up
his
station
in
front
of
him
,
*NL*
ready
to
smash
his
skull
at
the
slightest
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
Marius
heard
below
him
,
at
the
base
of
the
partition
,
*NL*
but
so
near
that
he
could
not
see
who
was
speaking
,
this
colloquy
*NL*
conducted
in
a
low
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
only
one
thing
left
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
his
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
husband
and
wife
taking
counsel
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
walked
slowly
towards
the
table
,
opened
the
drawer
,
and
*NL*
took
out
the
knife
.
Marius
fretted
with
the
handle
of
his
pistol
.
*NL*
Unprecedented
perplexity
!
For
the
last
hour
he
had
had
two
voices
in
his
*NL*
conscience
,
the
one
enjoining
him
to
respect
his
father
's
testament
,
the
*NL*
other
crying
to
him
to
rescue
the
prisoner
.
These
two
voices
continued
*NL*
uninterruptedly
that
struggle
which
tormented
him
to
agony
.
Up
to
that
*NL*
moment
he
had
cherished
a
vague
hope
that
he
should
find
some
means
*NL*
of
reconciling
these
two
duties
,
but
nothing
within
the
limits
of
*NL*
possibility
had
presented
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
peril
was
urgent
,
the
last
bounds
of
delay
had
been
*NL*
reached
;
Thenardier
was
standing
thoughtfully
a
few
paces
distant
from
*NL*
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
cast
a
wild
glance
about
him
,
the
last
mechanical
resource
of
*NL*
despair
.
All
at
once
a
shudder
ran
through
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
his
feet
,
on
the
table
,
a
bright
ray
of
light
from
the
full
moon
*NL*
illuminated
and
seemed
to
point
out
to
him
a
sheet
of
paper
.
On
this
*NL*
paper
he
read
the
following
line
written
that
very
morning
,
in
large
*NL*
letters
,
by
the
eldest
of
the
Thenardier
girls
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
THE
BOBBIES
ARE
HERE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
,
a
flash
,
crossed
Marius
'
mind
;
this
was
the
expedient
of
which
*NL*
he
was
in
search
,
the
solution
of
that
frightful
problem
which
was
*NL*
torturing
him
,
of
sparing
the
assassin
and
saving
the
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knelt
down
on
his
commode
,
stretched
out
his
arm
,
seized
the
sheet
of
*NL*
paper
,
softly
detached
a
bit
of
plaster
from
the
wall
,
wrapped
the
paper
*NL*
round
it
,
and
tossed
the
whole
through
the
crevice
into
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
den
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
high
time
.
Thenardier
had
conquered
his
last
fears
or
his
last
*NL*
scruples
,
and
was
advancing
on
the
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
is
falling
!
''
cried
the
Thenardier
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
asked
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
darted
forward
and
picked
up
the
bit
of
plaster
.
She
handed
it
*NL*
to
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
this
come
from
?
''
demanded
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardie
!
''
ejaculated
his
wife
,
``
where
do
you
suppose
it
came
from
?
*NL*
Through
the
window
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
it
pass
,
''
said
Bigrenaille
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
rapidly
unfolded
the
paper
and
held
it
close
to
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
in
Eponine
's
handwriting
.
The
devil
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
sign
to
his
wife
,
who
hastily
drew
near
,
and
showed
her
the
*NL*
line
written
on
the
sheet
of
paper
,
then
he
added
in
a
subdued
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
The
ladder
!
Let
's
leave
the
bacon
in
the
mousetrap
and
decamp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Without
cutting
that
man
's
throat
?
''
asked
,
the
Thenardier
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
n't
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
what
?
''
resumed
Bigrenaille
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
the
window
,
''
replied
Thenardier
.
``
Since
Ponine
has
thrown
the
*NL*
stone
through
the
window
,
it
indicates
that
the
house
is
not
watched
on
*NL*
that
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mask
with
the
ventriloquist
's
voice
deposited
his
huge
key
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
raised
both
arms
in
the
air
,
and
opened
and
clenched
his
fists
,
*NL*
three
times
rapidly
without
uttering
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
signal
like
the
signal
for
clearing
the
decks
for
action
on
*NL*
board
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ruffians
who
were
holding
the
prisoner
released
him
;
in
the
*NL*
twinkling
of
an
eye
the
rope
ladder
was
unrolled
outside
the
window
,
and
*NL*
solidly
fastened
to
the
sill
by
the
two
iron
hooks
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
paid
no
attention
to
what
was
going
on
around
him
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
be
dreaming
or
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
ladder
was
arranged
,
Thenardier
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
the
bourgeoise
first
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
rushed
headlong
to
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
just
as
he
was
about
to
throw
his
leg
over
,
Bigrenaille
seized
him
*NL*
roughly
by
the
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
,
come
now
,
you
old
dog
,
after
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
us
!
''
yelled
the
ruffians
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
children
,
''
said
Thenardier
,
``
we
are
losing
time
.
The
police
are
*NL*
on
our
heels
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
the
ruffians
,
``
let
's
draw
lots
to
see
who
shall
go
down
*NL*
first
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
mad
!
Are
you
crazy
!
What
a
pack
of
boobies

You
want
to
waste

do
you

Draw

do
you

By

wet

by

short
straw

With

Thrown
into

--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
my
hat
?
''
cried
a
voice
on
the
threshold
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
wheeled
round
.
It
was
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
was
holding
it
out
to
them
with
a
smile
.

CHAPTER
XXI
--
ONE
SHOULD
ALWAYS
BEGIN
BY
ARRESTING
THE
VICTIMS
*NL*
*NL*
At
nightfall
,
Javert
had
posted
his
men
and
had
gone
into
ambush
himself
*NL*
between
the
trees
of
the
Rue
de
la
Barrieredes-Gobelins
which
faced
*NL*
the
Gorbeau
house
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
boulevard
.
He
had
begun
*NL*
operations
by
opening
``
his
pockets
,
''
and
dropping
into
it
the
two
young
*NL*
girls
who
were
charged
with
keeping
a
watch
on
the
approaches
to
the
*NL*
den
.
But
he
had
only
``
caged
''
Azelma
.
As
for
Eponine
,
she
was
not
at
her
*NL*
post
,
she
had
disappeared
,
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
seize
her
.
Then
*NL*
Javert
had
made
a
point
and
had
bent
his
ear
to
waiting
for
the
signal
*NL*
agreed
upon
.
The
comings
and
goings
of
the
fiacres
had
greatly
agitated
*NL*
him
.
At
last
,
he
had
grown
impatient
,
and
,
sure
that
there
was
a
nest
*NL*
there
,
sure
of
being
in
``
luck
,
''
having
recognized
many
of
the
ruffians
*NL*
who
had
entered
,
he
had
finally
decided
to
go
upstairs
without
waiting
*NL*
for
the
pistol-shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
Marius
'
pass-key
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
arrived
just
in
the
nick
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
terrified
ruffians
flung
themselves
on
the
arms
which
they
had
*NL*
abandoned
in
all
the
corners
at
the
moment
of
flight
.
In
less
than
a
*NL*
second
,
these
seven
men
,
horrible
to
behold
,
had
grouped
themselves
in
*NL*
an
attitude
of
defence
,
one
with
his
meat-axe
,
another
with
his
key
,
*NL*
another
with
his
bludgeon
,
the
rest
with
shears
,
pincers
,
and
hammers
.
*NL*
Thenardier
had
his
knife
in
his
fist
.
The
Thenardier
woman
snatched
up
*NL*
an
enormous
paving-stone
which
lay
in
the
angle
of
the
window
and
served
*NL*
her
daughters
as
an
ottoman
.

*NL*
*NL*
Javert
put
on
his
hat
again
,
and
advanced
a
couple
of
paces
into
the
*NL*
room
,
with
arms
folded
,
his
cane
under
one
arm
,
his
sword
in
its
sheath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Halt
there
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
shall
not
go
out
by
the
window
,
you
shall
go
*NL*
through
the
door
.
It
's
less
unhealthy
.
There
are
seven
of
you
,
there
*NL*
are
fifteen
of
us
.
Do
n't
let
's
fall
to
collaring
each
other
like
men
of
*NL*
Auvergne
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bigrenaille
drew
out
a
pistol
which
he
had
kept
concealed
under
his
*NL*
blouse
,
and
put
it
in
Thenardier
's
hand
,
whispering
in
the
latter
's
*NL*
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Javert
.
I
do
n't
dare
fire
at
that
man
.
Do
you
dare
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parbleu
!
''
replied
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
took
the
pistol
and
aimed
at
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
,
who
was
only
three
paces
from
him
,
stared
intently
at
him
and
*NL*
contented
himself
with
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
do
n't
fire
.
You
'll
miss
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
pulled
the
trigger
.
The
pistol
missed
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
tell
you
so
!
''
ejaculated
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bigrenaille
flung
his
bludgeon
at
Javert
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
the
emperor
of
the
fiends
!
I
surrender
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
Javert
asked
the
rest
of
the
ruffians
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
we
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
began
again
calmly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
that
's
good
,
I
said
so
,
you
are
nice
fellows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
ask
one
thing
,
''
said
Bigrenaille
,
``
and
that
is
,
that
I
may
not
*NL*
be
denied
tobacco
while
I
am
in
confinement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Granted
,
''
said
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
round
and
calling
behind
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
squad
of
policemen
,
sword
in
hand
,
and
agents
armed
with
bludgeons
and
*NL*
cudgels
,
rushed
in
at
Javert
's
summons
.
They
pinioned
the
ruffians
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
throng
of
men
,
sparely
lighted
by
the
single
candle
,
filled
the
den
*NL*
with
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handcuff
them
all
!
''
shouted
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
on
!
''
cried
a
voice
which
was
not
the
voice
of
a
man
,
but
of
which
*NL*
no
one
would
ever
have
said
:
``
It
is
a
woman
's
voice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
woman
had
entrenched
herself
in
one
of
the
angles
of
the
*NL*
window
,
and
it
was
she
who
had
just
given
vent
to
this
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
policemen
and
agents
recoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
thrown
off
her
shawl
,
but
retained
her
bonnet
;
her
husband
,
who
*NL*
was
crouching
behind
her
,
was
almost
hidden
under
the
discarded
*NL*
shawl
,
and
she
was
shielding
him
with
her
body
,
as
she
elevated
the
*NL*
paving-stone
above
her
head
with
the
gesture
of
a
giantess
on
the
point
*NL*
of
hurling
a
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beware
!
''
she
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
crowded
back
towards
the
corridor
.
A
broad
open
space
was
cleared
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
garret
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
woman
cast
a
glance
at
the
ruffians
who
had
allowed
*NL*
themselves
to
be
pinioned
,
and
muttered
in
hoarse
and
guttural
*NL*
accents
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cowards
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
smiled
,
and
advanced
across
the
open
space
which
the
Thenardier
*NL*
was
devouring
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
come
near
me
,
''
she
cried
,
``
or
I
'll
crush
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
grenadier
!
''
ejaculated
Javert
;
``
you
've
got
a
beard
like
a
man
,
*NL*
mother
,
but
I
have
claws
like
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
continued
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
,
dishevelled
and
terrible
,
set
her
feet
far
apart
,
threw
*NL*
herself
backwards
,
and
hurled
the
paving-stone
at
Javert
's
head
.
Javert
*NL*
ducked
,
the
stone
passed
over
him
,
struck
the
wall
behind
,
knocked
off
a
*NL*
huge
piece
of
plastering
,
and
,
rebounding
from
angle
to
angle
across
the
*NL*
hovel
,
now
luckily
almost
empty
,
rested
at
Javert
's
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
Javert
reached
the
Thenardier
couple
.
One
of
his
*NL*
big
hands
descended
on
the
woman
's
shoulder
;
the
other
on
the
husband
's
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
handcuffs
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
policemen
trooped
in
in
force
,
and
in
a
few
seconds
Javert
's
order
*NL*
had
been
executed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Thenardier
female
,
overwhelmed
,
stared
at
her
pinioned
hands
,
and
*NL*
at
those
of
her
husband
,
who
had
dropped
to
the
floor
,
and
exclaimed
,
*NL*
weeping
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughters
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
in
the
jug
,
''
said
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
agents
had
caught
sight
of
the
drunken
man
asleep
*NL*
behind
the
door
,
and
were
shaking
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
awoke
,
stammering
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
all
over
,
Jondrette
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
six
pinioned
ruffians
were
standing
,
and
still
preserved
their
*NL*
spectral
mien
;
all
three
besmeared
with
black
,
all
three
masked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
on
your
masks
,
''
said
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
passing
them
in
review
with
a
glance
of
a
Frederick
II
.
at
a
Potsdam
*NL*
parade
,
he
said
to
the
three
``
chimney-builders
''
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
Bigrenaille
!
good
day
,
Brujon
!
good
day
,
Deuxmilliards
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
turning
to
the
three
masked
men
,
he
said
to
the
man
with
the
*NL*
meat-axe
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
Gueulemer
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
the
man
with
the
cudgel
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
Babet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
to
the
ventriloquist
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
health
,
Claquesous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
ruffians
'
prisoner
,
who
,
ever
*NL*
since
the
entrance
of
the
police
,
had
not
uttered
a
word
,
and
had
held
*NL*
his
head
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Untie
the
gentleman
!
''
said
Javert
,
``
and
let
no
one
go
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
he
seated
himself
with
sovereign
dignity
before
the
table
,
*NL*
where
the
candle
and
the
writing-materials
still
remained
,
drew
a
*NL*
stamped
paper
from
his
pocket
,
and
began
to
prepare
his
report
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
written
the
first
lines
,
which
are
formulas
that
never
vary
,
*NL*
he
raised
his
eyes
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
gentleman
whom
these
gentlemen
bound
step
forward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
policemen
glanced
round
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Javert
,
``
where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
prisoner
of
the
ruffians
,
M.
Leblanc
,
M.
Urbain
Fabre
,
the
father
of
*NL*
Ursule
or
the
Lark
,
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
guarded
,
but
the
window
was
not
.
As
soon
as
he
had
found
*NL*
himself
released
from
his
bonds
,
and
while
Javert
was
drawing
up
his
*NL*
report
,
he
had
taken
advantage
of
confusion
,
the
crowd
,
the
darkness
,
*NL*
and
of
a
moment
when
the
general
attention
was
diverted
from
him
,
to
*NL*
dash
out
of
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
agent
sprang
to
the
opening
and
looked
out
.
He
saw
no
one
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rope
ladder
was
still
shaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
ejaculated
Javert
between
his
teeth
,
``
he
must
have
been
the
*NL*
most
valuable
of
the
lot
.

CHAPTER
XXII
--
THE
LITTLE
ONE
WHO
WAS
CRYING
IN
VOLUME
TWO
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
following
that
on
which
these
events
took
place
in
the
house
*NL*
on
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
,
a
child
,
who
seemed
to
be
coming
from
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
,
was
ascending
the
side-alley
on
*NL*
the
right
in
the
direction
of
the
Barriere
de
Fontainebleau
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
fully
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lad
was
pale
,
thin
,
clad
in
rags
,
with
linen
trousers
in
the
month
*NL*
of
February
,
and
was
singing
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
the
Rue
du
Petit-Banquier
,
a
bent
old
woman
was
*NL*
rummaging
in
a
heap
of
refuse
by
the
light
of
a
street
lantern
;
the
*NL*
child
jostled
her
as
he
passed
,
then
recoiled
,
exclaiming
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
!
And
I
took
it
for
an
enormous
,
enormous
dog
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pronounced
the
word
enormous
the
second
time
with
a
jeering
swell
*NL*
of
the
voice
which
might
be
tolerably
well
represented
by
capitals
:
``
an
*NL*
enormous
,
ENORMOUS
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
straightened
herself
up
in
a
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nasty
brat
!
''
she
grumbled
.
``
If
I
had
n't
been
bending
over
,
I
know
well
*NL*
where
I
would
have
planted
my
foot
on
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
was
already
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kisss
!
kisss
!
''
he
cried
.
``
After
that
,
I
do
n't
think
I
was
mistaken
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
,
choking
with
indignation
,
now
rose
completely
upright
,
*NL*
and
the
red
gleam
of
the
lantern
fully
lighted
up
her
livid
face
,
all
*NL*
hollowed
into
angles
and
wrinkles
,
with
crow
's
-
feet
meeting
the
corners
*NL*
of
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
body
was
lost
in
the
darkness
,
and
only
her
head
was
visible
.
One
*NL*
would
have
pronounced
her
a
mask
of
Decrepitude
carved
out
by
a
light
*NL*
from
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
boy
surveyed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
,
''
said
he
,
``
does
not
possess
that
style
of
beauty
which
pleases
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
pursued
his
road
,
and
resumed
his
song
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Le
roi
Coupdesabot
*NL*
S'en
allait
a
la
chasse
,
*NL*
A
la
chasse
aux
corbeaux
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
these
three
lines
he
paused
.
He
had
arrived
in
front
of
*NL*
No.
50-52
,
and
finding
the
door
fastened
,
he
began
to
assault
it
with
*NL*
resounding
and
heroic
kicks
,
which
betrayed
rather
the
man
's
shoes
that
*NL*
he
was
wearing
than
the
child
's
feet
which
he
owned
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
very
old
woman
whom
he
had
encountered
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
Rue
du
Petit-Banquier
hastened
up
behind
him
,
uttering
*NL*
clamorous
cries
and
indulging
in
lavish
and
exaggerated
gestures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
this
?
What
's
this
?
Lord
God
!
He
's
battering
the
door
down
!
He
's
*NL*
knocking
the
house
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
kicks
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
strained
her
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
the
way
buildings
are
treated
nowadays
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
she
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
recognized
the
gamin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
so
it
's
that
imp
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
the
old
lady
,
''
said
the
lad
.
``
Good
day
,
Bougonmuche
.
I
have
*NL*
come
to
see
my
ancestors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
retorted
with
a
composite
grimace
,
and
a
wonderful
*NL*
improvisation
of
hatred
taking
advantage
of
feebleness
and
ugliness
,
*NL*
which
was
,
unfortunately
,
wasted
in
the
dark
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
one
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
retorted
the
boy
,
``
where
's
my
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
La
Force
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
!
And
my
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
Saint-Lazare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
And
my
sisters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Madelonettes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
scratched
his
head
behind
his
ear
,
stared
at
Ma'am
Bougon
,
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
executed
a
pirouette
on
his
heel
;
a
moment
later
,
the
old
woman
,
*NL*
who
had
remained
on
the
door-step
,
heard
him
singing
in
his
clear
,
young
*NL*
voice
,
as
he
plunged
under
the
black
elm-trees
,
in
the
wintry
wind

*NL*
1831
and
1832
,
the
two
years
which
are
immediately
connected
with
the
*NL*
Revolution
of
July
,
form
one
of
the
most
peculiar
and
striking
moments
*NL*
of
history
.
These
two
years
rise
like
two
mountains
midway
between
those
*NL*
which
precede
and
those
which
follow
them
.
They
have
a
revolutionary
*NL*
grandeur
.
Precipices
are
to
be
distinguished
there
.
The
social
masses
,
*NL*
the
very
assizes
of
civilization
,
the
solid
group
of
superposed
and
*NL*
adhering
interests
,
the
century-old
profiles
of
the
ancient
French
*NL*
formation
,
appear
and
disappear
in
them
every
instant
,
athwart
the
storm
*NL*
clouds
of
systems
,
of
passions
,
and
of
theories
.
These
appearances
*NL*
and
disappearances
have
been
designated
as
movement
and
resistance
.
*NL*
At
intervals
,
truth
,
that
daylight
of
the
human
soul
,
can
be
descried
*NL*
shining
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
remarkable
epoch
is
decidedly
circumscribed
and
is
beginning
to
*NL*
be
sufficiently
distant
from
us
to
allow
of
our
grasping
the
principal
*NL*
lines
even
at
the
present
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
make
the
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Restoration
had
been
one
of
those
intermediate
phases
,
hard
to
*NL*
define
,
in
which
there
is
fatigue
,
buzzing
,
murmurs
,
sleep
,
tumult
,
*NL*
and
which
are
nothing
else
than
the
arrival
of
a
great
nation
at
a
*NL*
halting-place
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
epochs
are
peculiar
and
mislead
the
politicians
who
desire
to
*NL*
convert
them
to
profit
.
In
the
beginning
,
the
nation
asks
nothing
but
*NL*
repose
;
it
thirsts
for
but
one
thing
,
peace
;
it
has
but
one
ambition
,
*NL*
to
be
small
.
Which
is
the
translation
of
remaining
tranquil
.
Of
great
*NL*
events
,
great
hazards
,
great
adventures
,
great
men
,
thank
God
,
we
*NL*
have
seen
enough
,
we
have
them
heaped
higher
than
our
heads
.
We
would
*NL*
exchange
Caesar
for
Prusias
,
and
Napoleon
for
the
King
of
Yvetot
.
``
What
*NL*
a
good
little
king
was
he
!
''
We
have
marched
since
daybreak
,
we
have
*NL*
reached
the
evening
of
a
long
and
toilsome
day
;
we
have
made
our
first
*NL*
change
with
Mirabeau
,
the
second
with
Robespierre
,
the
third
with
*NL*
Bonaparte
;
we
are
worn
out
.
Each
one
demands
a
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Devotion
which
is
weary
,
heroism
which
has
grown
old
,
ambitions
which
*NL*
are
sated
,
fortunes
which
are
made
,
seek
,
demand
,
implore
,
solicit
,
*NL*
what
?
A
shelter
.
They
have
it
.
They
take
possession
of
peace
,
of
*NL*
tranquillity
,
of
leisure
;
behold
,
they
are
content
.
But
,
at
the
same
*NL*
time
certain
facts
arise
,
compel
recognition
,
and
knock
at
the
door
in
*NL*
their
turn
.
These
facts
are
the
products
of
revolutions
and
wars
,
they
*NL*
are
,
they
exist
,
they
have
the
right
to
install
themselves
in
society
,
*NL*
and
they
do
install
themselves
therein
;
and
most
of
the
time
,
facts
*NL*
are
the
stewards
of
the
household
and
fouriers
-LSB-
32
-RSB-
who
do
nothing
but
*NL*
prepare
lodgings
for
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
then
,
is
what
appears
to
philosophical
politicians
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
that
weary
men
demand
repose
,
accomplished
facts
demand
*NL*
guarantees
.
Guarantees
are
the
same
to
facts
that
repose
is
to
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
England
demanded
of
the
Stuarts
after
the
Protector
;
this
*NL*
is
what
France
demanded
of
the
Bourbons
after
the
Empire
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
guarantees
are
a
necessity
of
the
times
.
They
must
be
accorded
.
*NL*
Princes
``
grant
''
them
,
but
in
reality
,
it
is
the
force
of
things
which
*NL*
gives
them
.
A
profound
truth
,
and
one
useful
to
know
,
which
the
Stuarts
*NL*
did
not
suspect
in
1662
and
which
the
Bourbons
did
not
even
obtain
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
in
1814
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
predestined
family
,
which
returned
to
France
when
Napoleon
fell
,
had
*NL*
the
fatal
simplicity
to
believe
that
it
was
itself
which
bestowed
,
and
*NL*
that
what
it
had
bestowed
it
could
take
back
again
;
that
the
House
of
*NL*
Bourbon
possessed
the
right
divine
,
that
France
possessed
nothing
,
and
*NL*
that
the
political
right
conceded
in
the
charter
of
Louis
XVIII
.
was
*NL*
merely
a
branch
of
the
right
divine
,
was
detached
by
the
House
of
*NL*
Bourbon
and
graciously
given
to
the
people
until
such
day
as
it
should
*NL*
please
the
King
to
reassume
it
.
Still
,
the
House
of
Bourbon
should
have
*NL*
felt
,
from
the
displeasure
created
by
the
gift
,
that
it
did
not
come
*NL*
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
house
was
churlish
to
the
nineteenth
century
.
It
put
on
an
*NL*
ill-tempered
look
at
every
development
of
the
nation
.
To
make
use
of
a
*NL*
trivial
word
,
that
is
to
say
,
of
a
popular
and
a
true
word
,
it
looked
*NL*
glum
.
The
people
saw
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
thought
it
possessed
strength
because
the
Empire
had
been
carried
*NL*
away
before
it
like
a
theatrical
stage-setting
.
It
did
not
perceive
that
*NL*
it
had
,
itself
,
been
brought
in
in
the
same
fashion
.
It
did
not
perceive
*NL*
that
it
also
lay
in
that
hand
which
had
removed
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
thought
that
it
had
roots
,
because
it
was
the
past
.
It
was
mistaken
;
*NL*
it
formed
a
part
of
the
past
,
but
the
whole
past
was
France
.
The
roots
*NL*
of
French
society
were
not
fixed
in
the
Bourbons
,
but
in
the
nations
.
*NL*
These
obscure
and
lively
roots
constituted
,
not
the
right
of
a
family
,
*NL*
but
the
history
of
a
people
.
They
were
everywhere
,
except
under
the
*NL*
throne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
House
of
Bourbon
was
to
France
the
illustrious
and
bleeding
knot
in
*NL*
her
history
,
but
was
no
longer
the
principal
element
of
her
destiny
,
*NL*
and
the
necessary
base
of
her
politics
.
She
could
get
along
without
the
*NL*
Bourbons
;
she
had
done
without
them
for
two
and
twenty
years
;
there
*NL*
had
been
a
break
of
continuity
;
they
did
not
suspect
the
fact
.
And
how
*NL*
should
they
have
suspected
it
,
they
who
fancied
that
Louis
XVII
.
reigned
*NL*
on
the
9th
of
Thermidor
,
and
that
Louis
XVIII
.
was
reigning
at
the
*NL*
battle
of
Marengo
?
Never
,
since
the
origin
of
history
,
had
princes
been
*NL*
so
blind
in
the
presence
of
facts
and
the
portion
of
divine
authority
*NL*
which
facts
contain
and
promulgate
.
Never
had
that
pretension
here
below
*NL*
which
is
called
the
right
of
kings
denied
to
such
a
point
the
right
from
*NL*
on
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
capital
error
which
led
this
family
to
lay
its
hand
once
more
on
the
*NL*
guarantees
``
granted
''
in
1814
,
on
the
concessions
,
as
it
termed
them
.
*NL*
Sad
.
A
sad
thing
!
What
it
termed
its
concessions
were
our
conquests
;
*NL*
what
it
termed
our
encroachments
were
our
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
hour
seemed
to
it
to
have
come
,
the
Restoration
,
supposing
*NL*
itself
victorious
over
Bonaparte
and
well-rooted
in
the
country
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
believing
itself
to
be
strong
and
deep
,
abruptly
decided
on
its
*NL*
plan
of
action
,
and
risked
its
stroke
.
One
morning
it
drew
itself
up
*NL*
before
the
face
of
France
,
and
,
elevating
its
voice
,
it
contested
the
*NL*
collective
title
and
the
individual
right
of
the
nation
to
sovereignty
,
*NL*
of
the
citizen
to
liberty
.
In
other
words
,
it
denied
to
the
nation
*NL*
that
which
made
it
a
nation
,
and
to
the
citizen
that
which
made
him
a
*NL*
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
foundation
of
those
famous
acts
which
are
called
the
*NL*
ordinances
of
July
.
The
Restoration
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
fell
justly
.
But
,
we
admit
,
it
had
not
been
absolutely
hostile
to
*NL*
all
forms
of
progress
.
Great
things
had
been
accomplished
,
with
it
*NL*
alongside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
Restoration
,
the
nation
had
grown
accustomed
to
calm
*NL*
discussion
,
which
had
been
lacking
under
the
Republic
,
and
to
grandeur
*NL*
in
peace
,
which
had
been
wanting
under
the
Empire
.
France
free
and
*NL*
strong
had
offered
an
encouraging
spectacle
to
the
other
peoples
of
*NL*
Europe
.
The
Revolution
had
had
the
word
under
Robespierre
;
the
cannon
*NL*
had
had
the
word
under
Bonaparte
;
it
was
under
Louis
XVIII
.
and
Charles
*NL*
X.
that
it
was
the
turn
of
intelligence
to
have
the
word
.
The
wind
*NL*
ceased
,
the
torch
was
lighted
once
more
.
On
the
lofty
heights
,
the
*NL*
pure
light
of
mind
could
be
seen
flickering
.
A
magnificent
,
useful
,
and
*NL*
charming
spectacle
.
For
a
space
of
fifteen
years
,
those
great
principles
*NL*
which
are
so
old
for
the
thinker
,
so
new
for
the
statesman
,
could
be
*NL*
seen
at
work
in
perfect
peace
,
on
the
public
square
;
equality
before
the
*NL*
law
,
liberty
of
conscience
,
liberty
of
speech
,
liberty
of
the
press
,
the
*NL*
accessibility
of
all
aptitudes
to
all
functions
.
Thus
it
proceeded
until
*NL*
1830
.
The
Bourbons
were
an
instrument
of
civilization
which
broke
in
the
*NL*
hands
of
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fall
of
the
Bourbons
was
full
of
grandeur
,
not
on
their
side
,
but
*NL*
on
the
side
of
the
nation
.
They
quitted
the
throne
with
gravity
,
but
*NL*
without
authority
;
their
descent
into
the
night
was
not
one
of
those
*NL*
solemn
disappearances
which
leave
a
sombre
emotion
in
history
;
it
*NL*
was
neither
the
spectral
calm
of
Charles
I.
,
nor
the
eagle
scream
of
*NL*
Napoleon
.
They
departed
,
that
is
all
.
They
laid
down
the
crown
,
and
*NL*
retained
no
aureole
.
They
were
worthy
,
but
they
were
not
august
.
They
*NL*
lacked
,
in
a
certain
measure
,
the
majesty
of
their
misfortune
.
Charles
*NL*
X.
during
the
voyage
from
Cherbourg
,
causing
a
round
table
to
be
cut
*NL*
over
into
a
square
table
,
appeared
to
be
more
anxious
about
imperilled
*NL*
etiquette
than
about
the
crumbling
monarchy
.
This
diminution
saddened
*NL*
devoted
men
who
loved
their
persons
,
and
serious
men
who
honored
their
*NL*
race
.
The
populace
was
admirable
.
The
nation
,
attacked
one
morning
with
*NL*
weapons
,
by
a
sort
of
royal
insurrection
,
felt
itself
in
the
possession
*NL*
of
so
much
force
that
it
did
not
go
into
a
rage
.
It
defended
itself
,
*NL*
restrained
itself
,
restored
things
to
their
places
,
the
government
to
*NL*
law
,
the
Bourbons
to
exile
,
alas
!
and
then
halted
!
It
took
the
old
king
*NL*
Charles
X.
from
beneath
that
dais
which
had
sheltered
Louis
XIV
.
and
*NL*
set
him
gently
on
the
ground
.
It
touched
the
royal
personages
only
with
*NL*
sadness
and
precaution
.
It
was
not
one
man
,
it
was
not
a
few
men
,
it
*NL*
was
France
,
France
entire
,
France
victorious
and
intoxicated
with
her
*NL*
victory
,
who
seemed
to
be
coming
to
herself
,
and
who
put
into
practice
,
*NL*
before
the
eyes
of
the
whole
world
,
these
grave
words
of
Guillaume
du
*NL*
Vair
after
the
day
of
the
Barricades
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
easy
for
those
who
are
accustomed
to
skim
the
favors
of
the
*NL*
great
,
and
to
spring
,
like
a
bird
from
bough
to
bough
,
from
an
afflicted
*NL*
fortune
to
a
flourishing
one
,
to
show
themselves
harsh
towards
their
*NL*
Prince
in
his
adversity
;
but
as
for
me
,
the
fortune
of
my
Kings
and
*NL*
especially
of
my
afflicted
Kings
,
will
always
be
venerable
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bourbons
carried
away
with
them
respect
,
but
not
regret
.
As
we
have
*NL*
just
stated
,
their
misfortune
was
greater
than
they
were
.
They
faded
out
*NL*
in
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Revolution
of
July
instantly
had
friends
and
enemies
throughout
the
*NL*
entire
world
.
The
first
rushed
toward
her
with
joy
and
enthusiasm
,
the
*NL*
others
turned
away
,
each
according
to
his
nature
.
At
the
first
blush
,
*NL*
the
princes
of
Europe
,
the
owls
of
this
dawn
,
shut
their
eyes
,
wounded
*NL*
and
stupefied
,
and
only
opened
them
to
threaten
.
A
fright
which
can
be
*NL*
comprehended
,
a
wrath
which
can
be
pardoned
.
This
strange
revolution
had
*NL*
hardly
produced
a
shock
;
it
had
not
even
paid
to
vanquished
royalty
the
*NL*
honor
of
treating
it
as
an
enemy
,
and
of
shedding
its
blood
.
In
the
eyes
*NL*
of
despotic
governments
,
who
are
always
interested
in
having
liberty
*NL*
calumniate
itself
,
the
Revolution
of
July
committed
the
fault
of
being
*NL*
formidable
and
of
remaining
gentle
.
Nothing
,
however
,
was
attempted
or
*NL*
plotted
against
it
.
The
most
discontented
,
the
most
irritated
,
the
most
*NL*
trembling
,
saluted
it
;
whatever
our
egotism
and
our
rancor
may
be
,
a
*NL*
mysterious
respect
springs
from
events
in
which
we
are
sensible
of
the
*NL*
collaboration
of
some
one
who
is
working
above
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Revolution
of
July
is
the
triumph
of
right
overthrowing
the
fact
.
A
*NL*
thing
which
is
full
of
splendor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Right
overthrowing
the
fact
.
Hence
the
brilliancy
of
the
Revolution
of
*NL*
1830
,
hence
,
also
,
its
mildness
.
Right
triumphant
has
no
need
of
being
*NL*
violent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Right
is
the
just
and
the
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
property
of
right
is
to
remain
eternally
beautiful
and
pure
.
The
*NL*
fact
,
even
when
most
necessary
to
all
appearances
,
even
when
most
*NL*
thoroughly
accepted
by
contemporaries
,
if
it
exist
only
as
a
fact
,
and
*NL*
if
it
contain
only
too
little
of
right
,
or
none
at
all
,
is
infallibly
*NL*
destined
to
become
,
in
the
course
of
time
,
deformed
,
impure
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
even
monstrous
.
If
one
desires
to
learn
at
one
blow
,
to
what
degree
of
*NL*
hideousness
the
fact
can
attain
,
viewed
at
the
distance
of
centuries
,
*NL*
let
him
look
at
Machiavelli
.
Machiavelli
is
not
an
evil
genius
,
nor
a
*NL*
demon
,
nor
a
miserable
and
cowardly
writer
;
he
is
nothing
but
the
fact
.
*NL*
And
he
is
not
only
the
Italian
fact
;
he
is
the
European
fact
,
the
*NL*
fact
of
the
sixteenth
century
.
He
seems
hideous
,
and
so
he
is
,
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
moral
idea
of
the
nineteenth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
conflict
of
right
and
fact
has
been
going
on
ever
since
the
origin
*NL*
of
society
.
To
terminate
this
duel
,
to
amalgamate
the
pure
idea
with
the
*NL*
humane
reality
,
to
cause
right
to
penetrate
pacifically
into
the
fact
*NL*
and
the
fact
into
right
,
that
is
the
task
of
sages
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
II
--
BADLY
SEWED
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
task
of
sages
is
one
thing
,
the
task
of
clever
men
is
another
.
*NL*
The
Revolution
of
1830
came
to
a
sudden
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
a
revolution
has
made
the
coast
,
the
skilful
make
haste
to
*NL*
prepare
the
shipwreck
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
skilful
in
our
century
have
conferred
on
themselves
the
title
of
*NL*
Statesmen
;
so
that
this
word
,
statesmen
,
has
ended
by
becoming
somewhat
*NL*
of
a
slang
word
.
It
must
be
borne
in
mind
,
in
fact
,
that
wherever
*NL*
there
is
nothing
but
skill
,
there
is
necessarily
pettiness
.
To
say
``
the
*NL*
skilful
''
amounts
to
saying
``
the
mediocre
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
same
way
,
to
say
``
statesmen
''
is
sometimes
equivalent
to
saying
*NL*
``
traitors
.
''
If
,
then
,
we
are
to
believe
the
skilful
,
revolutions
like
*NL*
the
Revolution
of
July
are
severed
arteries
;
a
prompt
ligature
is
*NL*
indispensable
.
The
right
,
too
grandly
proclaimed
,
is
shaken
.
Also
,
right
*NL*
once
firmly
fixed
,
the
state
must
be
strengthened
.
Liberty
once
assured
,
*NL*
attention
must
be
directed
to
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
sages
are
not
,
as
yet
,
separated
from
the
skilful
,
but
they
*NL*
begin
to
be
distrustful
.
Power
,
very
good
.
But
,
in
the
first
place
,
what
*NL*
is
power
?
In
the
second
,
whence
comes
it
?
The
skilful
do
not
seem
to
*NL*
hear
the
murmured
objection
,
and
they
continue
their
manoeuvres
.
*NL*
*NL*
According
to
the
politicians
,
who
are
ingenious
in
putting
the
mask
*NL*
of
necessity
on
profitable
fictions
,
the
first
requirement
of
a
people
*NL*
after
a
revolution
,
when
this
people
forms
part
of
a
monarchical
*NL*
continent
,
is
to
procure
for
itself
a
dynasty
.
In
this
way
,
say
they
,
*NL*
peace
,
that
is
to
say
,
time
to
dress
our
wounds
,
and
to
repair
*NL*
the
house
,
can
be
had
after
a
revolution
.
The
dynasty
conceals
the
*NL*
scaffolding
and
covers
the
ambulance
.
Now
,
it
is
not
always
easy
to
*NL*
procure
a
dynasty
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
is
absolutely
necessary
,
the
first
man
of
genius
or
even
the
first
*NL*
man
of
fortune
who
comes
to
hand
suffices
for
the
manufacturing
of
a
*NL*
king
.
You
have
,
in
the
first
case
,
Napoleon
;
in
the
second
,
Iturbide
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
first
family
that
comes
to
hand
does
not
suffice
to
make
a
*NL*
dynasty
.
There
is
necessarily
required
a
certain
modicum
of
antiquity
in
*NL*
a
race
,
and
the
wrinkle
of
the
centuries
can
not
be
improvised
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
place
ourselves
at
the
point
of
view
of
the
``
statesmen
,
''
after
*NL*
making
all
allowances
,
of
course
,
after
a
revolution
,
what
are
the
*NL*
qualities
of
the
king
which
result
from
it
?
He
may
be
and
it
is
useful
*NL*
for
him
to
be
a
revolutionary
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
participant
in
his
own
*NL*
person
in
that
revolution
,
that
he
should
have
lent
a
hand
to
it
,
that
*NL*
he
should
have
either
compromised
or
distinguished
himself
therein
,
that
*NL*
he
should
have
touched
the
axe
or
wielded
the
sword
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
are
the
qualities
of
a
dynasty
?
It
should
be
national
;
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
revolutionary
at
a
distance
,
not
through
acts
committed
,
but
by
*NL*
reason
of
ideas
accepted
.
It
should
be
composed
of
past
and
be
historic
;
*NL*
be
composed
of
future
and
be
sympathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
explains
why
the
early
revolutions
contented
themselves
with
*NL*
finding
a
man
,
Cromwell
or
Napoleon
;
and
why
the
second
absolutely
*NL*
insisted
on
finding
a
family
,
the
House
of
Brunswick
or
the
House
of
*NL*
Orleans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Royal
houses
resemble
those
Indian
fig-trees
,
each
branch
of
which
,
*NL*
bending
over
to
the
earth
,
takes
root
and
becomes
a
fig-tree
itself
.
*NL*
Each
branch
may
become
a
dynasty
.
On
the
sole
condition
that
it
shall
*NL*
bend
down
to
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
the
theory
of
the
skilful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
then
,
lies
the
great
art
:
to
make
a
little
render
to
success
the
*NL*
sound
of
a
catastrophe
in
order
that
those
who
profit
by
it
may
tremble
*NL*
from
it
also
,
to
season
with
fear
every
step
that
is
taken
,
to
augment
*NL*
the
curve
of
the
transition
to
the
point
of
retarding
progress
,
to
dull
*NL*
that
aurora
,
to
denounce
and
retrench
the
harshness
of
enthusiasm
,
to
*NL*
cut
all
angles
and
nails
,
to
wad
triumph
,
to
muffle
up
right
,
to
envelop
*NL*
the
giant-people
in
flannel
,
and
to
put
it
to
bed
very
speedily
,
to
*NL*
impose
a
diet
on
that
excess
of
health
,
to
put
Hercules
on
the
treatment
*NL*
of
a
convalescent
,
to
dilute
the
event
with
the
expedient
,
to
offer
to
*NL*
spirits
thirsting
for
the
ideal
that
nectar
thinned
out
with
a
potion
,
*NL*
to
take
one
's
precautions
against
too
much
success
,
to
garnish
the
*NL*
revolution
with
a
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
1830
practised
this
theory
,
already
applied
to
England
by
1688
.
*NL*
*NL*
1830
is
a
revolution
arrested
midway
.
Half
of
progress
,
quasi-right
.
*NL*
Now
,
logic
knows
not
the
``
almost
,
''
absolutely
as
the
sun
knows
not
the
*NL*
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
arrests
revolutions
half-way
?
The
bourgeoisie
?
*NL*
*NL*
Why
?
*NL*
*NL*
Because
the
bourgeoisie
is
interest
which
has
reached
satisfaction
.
*NL*
Yesterday
it
was
appetite
,
to-day
it
is
plenitude
,
to-morrow
it
will
be
*NL*
satiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phenomenon
of
1814
after
Napoleon
was
reproduced
in
1830
after
*NL*
Charles
X
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attempt
has
been
made
,
and
wrongly
,
to
make
a
class
of
the
*NL*
bourgeoisie
.
The
bourgeoisie
is
simply
the
contented
portion
of
the
*NL*
people
.
The
bourgeois
is
the
man
who
now
has
time
to
sit
down
.
A
chair
*NL*
is
not
a
caste
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
through
a
desire
to
sit
down
too
soon
,
one
may
arrest
the
very
march
*NL*
of
the
human
race
.
This
has
often
been
the
fault
of
the
bourgeoisie
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
is
not
a
class
because
one
has
committed
a
fault
.
Selfishness
is
not
*NL*
one
of
the
divisions
of
the
social
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
we
must
be
just
to
selfishness
.
The
state
to
which
that
part
*NL*
of
the
nation
which
is
called
the
bourgeoisie
aspired
after
the
shock
*NL*
of
1830
was
not
the
inertia
which
is
complicated
with
indifference
and
*NL*
laziness
,
and
which
contains
a
little
shame
;
it
was
not
the
slumber
*NL*
which
presupposes
a
momentary
forgetfulness
accessible
to
dreams
;
it
was
*NL*
the
halt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
halt
is
a
word
formed
of
a
singular
double
and
almost
contradictory
*NL*
sense
:
a
troop
on
the
march
,
that
is
to
say
,
movement
;
a
stand
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
halt
is
the
restoration
of
forces
;
it
is
repose
armed
and
on
the
*NL*
alert
;
it
is
the
accomplished
fact
which
posts
sentinels
and
holds
*NL*
itself
on
its
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
halt
presupposes
the
combat
of
yesterday
and
the
combat
of
*NL*
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
partition
between
1830
and
1848
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
we
here
call
combat
may
also
be
designated
as
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bourgeoisie
then
,
as
well
as
the
statesmen
,
required
a
man
who
*NL*
should
express
this
word
Halt
.
An
Although-Because
.
A
composite
*NL*
individuality
,
signifying
revolution
and
signifying
stability
,
in
other
*NL*
terms
,
strengthening
the
present
by
the
evident
compatibility
of
the
*NL*
past
with
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
``
already
found
.
''
His
name
was
Louis
Philippe
d'Orleans
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
221
made
Louis
Philippe
King
.
Lafayette
undertook
the
coronation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
called
it
the
best
of
republics
.
The
town-hall
of
Paris
took
the
*NL*
place
of
the
Cathedral
of
Rheims
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
substitution
of
a
half-throne
for
a
whole
throne
was
``
the
work
of
*NL*
1830
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
skilful
had
finished
,
the
immense
vice
of
their
solution
became
*NL*
apparent
.
All
this
had
been
accomplished
outside
the
bounds
of
absolute
*NL*
right
.
Absolute
right
cried
:
``
I
protest
!
''
then
,
terrible
to
say
,
it
*NL*
retired
into
the
darkness
.

CHAPTER
III
--
LOUIS
PHILIPPE
*NL*
*NL*
Revolutions
have
a
terrible
arm
and
a
happy
hand
,
they
strike
firmly
and
*NL*
choose
well
.
Even
incomplete
,
even
debased
and
abused
and
reduced
to
the
*NL*
state
of
a
junior
revolution
like
the
Revolution
of
1830
,
they
nearly
*NL*
always
retain
sufficient
providential
lucidity
to
prevent
them
from
*NL*
falling
amiss
.
Their
eclipse
is
never
an
abdication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
let
us
not
boast
too
loudly
;
revolutions
also
may
be
*NL*
deceived
,
and
grave
errors
have
been
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
1830
.
1830
,
in
its
deviation
,
had
good
luck
.
In
the
*NL*
establishment
which
entitled
itself
order
after
the
revolution
had
been
*NL*
cut
short
,
the
King
amounted
to
more
than
royalty
.
Louis
Philippe
was
a
*NL*
rare
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
of
a
father
to
whom
history
will
accord
certain
attenuating
*NL*
circumstances
,
but
also
as
worthy
of
esteem
as
that
father
had
been
of
*NL*
blame
;
possessing
all
private
virtues
and
many
public
virtues
;
careful
*NL*
of
his
health
,
of
his
fortune
,
of
his
person
,
of
his
affairs
,
knowing
*NL*
the
value
of
a
minute
and
not
always
the
value
of
a
year
;
sober
,
serene
,
*NL*
peaceable
,
patient
;
a
good
man
and
a
good
prince
;
sleeping
with
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
having
in
his
palace
lackeys
charged
with
the
duty
of
showing
*NL*
the
conjugal
bed
to
the
bourgeois
,
an
ostentation
of
the
regular
*NL*
sleeping-apartment
which
had
become
useful
after
the
former
illegitimate
*NL*
displays
of
the
elder
branch
;
knowing
all
the
languages
of
Europe
,
and
,
*NL*
what
is
more
rare
,
all
the
languages
of
all
interests
,
and
speaking
*NL*
them
;
an
admirable
representative
of
the
``
middle
class
,
''
but
*NL*
outstripping
it
,
and
in
every
way
greater
than
it
;
possessing
excellent
*NL*
sense
,
while
appreciating
the
blood
from
which
he
had
sprung
,
counting
*NL*
most
of
all
on
his
intrinsic
worth
,
and
,
on
the
question
of
his
race
,
*NL*
very
particular
,
declaring
himself
Orleans
and
not
Bourbon
;
thoroughly
*NL*
the
first
Prince
of
the
Blood
Royal
while
he
was
still
only
a
Serene
*NL*
Highness
,
but
a
frank
bourgeois
from
the
day
he
became
king
;
diffuse
in
*NL*
public
,
concise
in
private
;
reputed
,
but
not
proved
to
be
a
miser
;
at
*NL*
bottom
,
one
of
those
economists
who
are
readily
prodigal
at
their
own
*NL*
fancy
or
duty
;
lettered
,
but
not
very
sensitive
to
letters
;
a
gentleman
,
*NL*
but
not
a
chevalier
;
simple
,
calm
,
and
strong
;
adored
by
his
family
and
*NL*
his
household
;
a
fascinating
talker
,
an
undeceived
statesman
,
inwardly
*NL*
cold
,
dominated
by
immediate
interest
,
always
governing
at
the
shortest
*NL*
range
,
incapable
of
rancor
and
of
gratitude
,
making
use
without
mercy
of
*NL*
superiority
on
mediocrity
,
clever
in
getting
parliamentary
majorities
to
*NL*
put
in
the
wrong
those
mysterious
unanimities
which
mutter
dully
under
*NL*
thrones
;
unreserved
,
sometimes
imprudent
in
his
lack
of
reserve
,
but
*NL*
with
marvellous
address
in
that
imprudence
;
fertile
in
expedients
,
in
*NL*
countenances
,
in
masks
;
making
France
fear
Europe
and
Europe
France
!
*NL*
Incontestably
fond
of
his
country
,
but
preferring
his
family
;
assuming
*NL*
more
domination
than
authority
and
more
authority
than
dignity
,
a
*NL*
disposition
which
has
this
unfortunate
property
,
that
as
it
turns
*NL*
everything
to
success
,
it
admits
of
ruse
and
does
not
absolutely
*NL*
repudiate
baseness
,
but
which
has
this
valuable
side
,
that
it
preserves
*NL*
politics
from
violent
shocks
,
the
state
from
fractures
,
and
society
*NL*
from
catastrophes
;
minute
,
correct
,
vigilant
,
attentive
,
sagacious
,
*NL*
indefatigable
;
contradicting
himself
at
times
and
giving
himself
the
*NL*
lie
;
bold
against
Austria
at
Ancona
,
obstinate
against
England
in
Spain
,
*NL*
bombarding
Antwerp
,
and
paying
off
Pritchard
;
singing
the
Marseillaise
*NL*
with
conviction
,
inaccessible
to
despondency
,
to
lassitude
,
to
the
taste
*NL*
for
the
beautiful
and
the
ideal
,
to
daring
generosity
,
to
Utopia
,
to
*NL*
chimeras
,
to
wrath
,
to
vanity
,
to
fear
;
possessing
all
the
forms
*NL*
of
personal
intrepidity
;
a
general
at
Valmy
;
a
soldier
at
Jemappes
;
*NL*
attacked
eight
times
by
regicides
and
always
smiling
.
Brave
as
a
*NL*
grenadier
,
courageous
as
a
thinker
;
uneasy
only
in
the
face
of
the
*NL*
chances
of
a
European
shaking
up
,
and
unfitted
for
great
political
*NL*
adventures
;
always
ready
to
risk
his
life
,
never
his
work
;
disguising
*NL*
his
will
in
influence
,
in
order
that
he
might
be
obeyed
as
an
*NL*
intelligence
rather
than
as
a
king
;
endowed
with
observation
and
not
*NL*
with
divination
;
not
very
attentive
to
minds
,
but
knowing
men
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
requiring
to
see
in
order
to
judge
;
prompt
and
penetrating
*NL*
good
sense
,
practical
wisdom
,
easy
speech
,
prodigious
memory
;
drawing
*NL*
incessantly
on
this
memory
,
his
only
point
of
resemblance
with
Caesar
,
*NL*
Alexander
,
and
Napoleon
;
knowing
deeds
,
facts
,
details
,
dates
,
proper
*NL*
names
,
ignorant
of
tendencies
,
passions
,
the
diverse
geniuses
of
the
*NL*
crowd
,
the
interior
aspirations
,
the
hidden
and
obscure
uprisings
of
*NL*
souls
,
in
a
word
,
all
that
can
be
designated
as
the
invisible
currents
*NL*
of
consciences
;
accepted
by
the
surface
,
but
little
in
accord
with
*NL*
France
lower
down
;
extricating
himself
by
dint
of
tact
;
governing
too
*NL*
much
and
not
enough
;
his
own
first
minister
;
excellent
at
creating
out
*NL*
of
the
pettiness
of
realities
an
obstacle
to
the
immensity
of
ideas
;
*NL*
mingling
a
genuine
creative
faculty
of
civilization
,
of
order
and
*NL*
organization
,
an
indescribable
spirit
of
proceedings
and
chicanery
,
the
*NL*
founder
and
lawyer
of
a
dynasty
;
having
something
of
Charlemagne
and
*NL*
something
of
an
attorney
;
in
short
,
a
lofty
and
original
figure
,
a
*NL*
prince
who
understood
how
to
create
authority
in
spite
of
the
uneasiness
*NL*
of
France
,
and
power
in
spite
of
the
jealousy
of
Europe
.
Louis
Philippe
*NL*
will
be
classed
among
the
eminent
men
of
his
century
,
and
would
be
*NL*
ranked
among
the
most
illustrious
governors
of
history
had
he
loved
*NL*
glory
but
a
little
,
and
if
he
had
had
the
sentiment
of
what
is
great
to
*NL*
the
same
degree
as
the
feeling
for
what
is
useful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
Philippe
had
been
handsome
,
and
in
his
old
age
he
remained
*NL*
graceful
;
not
always
approved
by
the
nation
,
he
always
was
so
by
the
*NL*
masses
;
he
pleased
.
He
had
that
gift
of
charming
.
He
lacked
majesty
;
he
*NL*
wore
no
crown
,
although
a
king
,
and
no
white
hair
,
although
an
old
man
;
*NL*
his
manners
belonged
to
the
old
regime
and
his
habits
to
the
new
;
a
*NL*
mixture
of
the
noble
and
the
bourgeois
which
suited
1830
;
Louis
Philippe
*NL*
was
transition
reigning
;
he
had
preserved
the
ancient
pronunciation
*NL*
and
the
ancient
orthography
which
he
placed
at
the
service
of
opinions
*NL*
modern
;
he
loved
Poland
and
Hungary
,
but
he
wrote
les
Polonois
,
and
he
*NL*
pronounced
les
Hongrais
.
He
wore
the
uniform
of
the
national
guard
,
like
*NL*
Charles
X.
,
and
the
ribbon
of
the
Legion
of
Honor
,
like
Napoleon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
a
little
to
chapel
,
not
at
all
to
the
chase
,
never
to
the
opera
.
*NL*
Incorruptible
by
sacristans
,
by
whippers-in
,
by
ballet-dancers
;
this
*NL*
made
a
part
of
his
bourgeois
popularity
.
He
had
no
heart
.
He
went
out
*NL*
with
his
umbrella
under
his
arm
,
and
this
umbrella
long
formed
a
part
of
*NL*
his
aureole
.
He
was
a
bit
of
a
mason
,
a
bit
of
a
gardener
,
something
*NL*
of
a
doctor
;
he
bled
a
postilion
who
had
tumbled
from
his
horse
;
Louis
*NL*
Philippe
no
more
went
about
without
his
lancet
,
than
did
Henri
IV
.
*NL*
without
his
poniard
.
The
Royalists
jeered
at
this
ridiculous
king
,
the
*NL*
first
who
had
ever
shed
blood
with
the
object
of
healing
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
grievances
against
Louis
Philippe
,
there
is
one
deduction
to
be
*NL*
made
;
there
is
that
which
accuses
royalty
,
that
which
accuses
the
reign
,
*NL*
that
which
accuses
the
King
;
three
columns
which
all
give
different
*NL*
totals
.
Democratic
right
confiscated
,
progress
becomes
a
matter
of
*NL*
secondary
interest
,
the
protests
of
the
street
violently
repressed
,
*NL*
military
execution
of
insurrections
,
the
rising
passed
over
by
arms
,
the
*NL*
Rue
Transnonain
,
the
counsels
of
war
,
the
absorption
of
the
real
*NL*
country
by
the
legal
country
,
on
half
shares
with
three
hundred
thousand
*NL*
privileged
persons
,
--
these
are
the
deeds
of
royalty
;
Belgium
refused
,
*NL*
Algeria
too
harshly
conquered
,
and
,
as
in
the
case
of
India
by
the
*NL*
English
,
with
more
barbarism
than
civilization
,
the
breach
of
faith
,
to
*NL*
Abd-el-Kader
,
Blaye
,
Deutz
bought
,
Pritchard
paid
,
--
these
are
the
doings
*NL*
of
the
reign
;
the
policy
which
was
more
domestic
than
national
was
the
*NL*
doing
of
the
King
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
will
be
seen
,
the
proper
deduction
having
been
made
,
the
King
's
*NL*
charge
is
decreased
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
his
great
fault
;
he
was
modest
in
the
name
of
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whence
arises
this
fault
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
state
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
Philippe
was
rather
too
much
of
a
paternal
king
;
that
incubation
*NL*
of
a
family
with
the
object
of
founding
a
dynasty
is
afraid
of
*NL*
everything
and
does
not
like
to
be
disturbed
;
hence
excessive
timidity
,
*NL*
which
is
displeasing
to
the
people
,
who
have
the
14th
of
July
in
their
*NL*
civil
and
Austerlitz
in
their
military
tradition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
if
we
deduct
the
public
duties
which
require
to
be
fulfilled
*NL*
first
of
all
,
that
deep
tenderness
of
Louis
Philippe
towards
his
*NL*
family
was
deserved
by
the
family
.
That
domestic
group
was
worthy
of
*NL*
admiration
.
Virtues
there
dwelt
side
by
side
with
talents
.
One
of
Louis
*NL*
Philippe
's
daughters
,
Marie
d'Orleans
,
placed
the
name
of
her
race
among
*NL*
artists
,
as
Charles
d'Orleans
had
placed
it
among
poets
.
She
made
of
*NL*
her
soul
a
marble
which
she
named
Jeanne
d'Arc
.
Two
of
Louis
Philippe
's
*NL*
daughters
elicited
from
Metternich
this
eulogium
:
``
They
are
young
people
*NL*
such
as
are
rarely
seen
,
and
princes
such
as
are
never
seen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
without
any
dissimulation
,
and
also
without
any
exaggeration
,
is
*NL*
the
truth
about
Louis
Philippe
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
Prince
Equality
,
to
bear
in
his
own
person
the
contradiction
of
*NL*
the
Restoration
and
the
Revolution
,
to
have
that
disquieting
side
of
the
*NL*
revolutionary
which
becomes
reassuring
in
governing
power
,
therein
lay
*NL*
the
fortune
of
Louis
Philippe
in
1830
;
never
was
there
a
more
complete
*NL*
adaptation
of
a
man
to
an
event
;
the
one
entered
into
the
other
,
and
the
*NL*
incarnation
took
place
.
Louis
Philippe
is
1830
made
man
.
Moreover
,
he
*NL*
had
in
his
favor
that
great
recommendation
to
the
throne
,
exile
.
He
had
*NL*
been
proscribed
,
a
wanderer
,
poor
.
He
had
lived
by
his
own
labor
.
In
*NL*
Switzerland
,
this
heir
to
the
richest
princely
domains
in
France
had
*NL*
sold
an
old
horse
in
order
to
obtain
bread
.
At
Reichenau
,
he
gave
*NL*
lessons
in
mathematics
,
while
his
sister
Adelaide
did
wool
work
and
*NL*
sewed
.
These
souvenirs
connected
with
a
king
rendered
the
bourgeoisie
*NL*
enthusiastic
.
He
had
,
with
his
own
hands
,
demolished
the
iron
cage
of
*NL*
Mont-Saint-Michel
,
built
by
Louis
XI
,
and
used
by
Louis
XV
.
He
was
the
*NL*
companion
of
Dumouriez
,
he
was
the
friend
of
Lafayette
;
he
had
belonged
*NL*
to
the
Jacobins
'
club
;
Mirabeau
had
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
;
Danton
*NL*
had
said
to
him
:
``
Young
man
!
''
At
the
age
of
four
and
twenty
,
in
'
93
,
*NL*
being
then
M.
de
Chartres
,
he
had
witnessed
,
from
the
depth
of
a
box
,
*NL*
the
trial
of
Louis
XVI.
,
so
well
named
that
poor
tyrant
.
The
blind
*NL*
clairvoyance
of
the
Revolution
,
breaking
royalty
in
the
King
and
the
*NL*
King
with
royalty
,
did
so
almost
without
noticing
the
man
in
the
fierce
*NL*
crushing
of
the
idea
,
the
vast
storm
of
the
Assembly-Tribunal
,
the
*NL*
public
wrath
interrogating
,
Capet
not
knowing
what
to
reply
,
the
*NL*
alarming
,
stupefied
vacillation
by
that
royal
head
beneath
that
sombre
*NL*
breath
,
the
relative
innocence
of
all
in
that
catastrophe
,
of
those
*NL*
who
condemned
as
well
as
of
the
man
condemned
,
--
he
had
looked
on
those
*NL*
things
,
he
had
contemplated
that
giddiness
;
he
had
seen
the
centuries
*NL*
appear
before
the
bar
of
the
Assembly-Convention
;
he
had
beheld
,
behind
*NL*
Louis
XVI.
,
that
unfortunate
passer-by
who
was
made
responsible
,
the
*NL*
terrible
culprit
,
the
monarchy
,
rise
through
the
shadows
;
and
there
had
*NL*
lingered
in
his
soul
the
respectful
fear
of
these
immense
justices
of
*NL*
the
populace
,
which
are
almost
as
impersonal
as
the
justice
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trace
left
in
him
by
the
Revolution
was
prodigious
.
Its
memory
was
*NL*
like
a
living
imprint
of
those
great
years
,
minute
by
minute
.
One
day
,
*NL*
in
the
presence
of
a
witness
whom
we
are
not
permitted
to
doubt
,
he
*NL*
rectified
from
memory
the
whole
of
the
letter
A
in
the
alphabetical
list
*NL*
of
the
Constituent
Assembly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
Philippe
was
a
king
of
the
broad
daylight
.
While
he
reigned
the
*NL*
press
was
free
,
the
tribune
was
free
,
conscience
and
speech
were
free
.
*NL*
The
laws
of
September
are
open
to
sight
.
Although
fully
aware
of
the
*NL*
gnawing
power
of
light
on
privileges
,
he
left
his
throne
exposed
to
the
*NL*
light
.
History
will
do
justice
to
him
for
this
loyalty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
Philippe
,
like
all
historical
men
who
have
passed
from
the
scene
,
*NL*
is
to-day
put
on
his
trial
by
the
human
conscience
.
His
case
is
,
as
yet
,
*NL*
only
in
the
lower
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
when
history
speaks
with
its
free
and
venerable
accent
,
has
*NL*
not
yet
sounded
for
him
;
the
moment
has
not
come
to
pronounce
a
definite
*NL*
judgment
on
this
king
;
the
austere
and
illustrious
historian
Louis
Blanc
*NL*
has
himself
recently
softened
his
first
verdict
;
Louis
Philippe
was
*NL*
elected
by
those
two
almosts
which
are
called
the
221
and
1830
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
by
a
half-Parliament
,
and
a
half-revolution
;
and
in
any
case
,
*NL*
from
the
superior
point
of
view
where
philosophy
must
place
itself
,
we
*NL*
can
not
judge
him
here
,
as
the
reader
has
seen
above
,
except
with
certain
*NL*
reservations
in
the
name
of
the
absolute
democratic
principle
;
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
absolute
,
outside
these
two
rights
,
the
right
of
man
in
the
*NL*
first
place
,
the
right
of
the
people
in
the
second
,
all
is
usurpation
;
*NL*
but
what
we
can
say
,
even
at
the
present
day
,
that
after
making
these
*NL*
reserves
is
,
that
to
sum
up
the
whole
,
and
in
whatever
manner
he
is
*NL*
considered
,
Louis
Philippe
,
taken
in
himself
,
and
from
the
point
of
view
*NL*
of
human
goodness
,
will
remain
,
to
use
the
antique
language
of
ancient
*NL*
history
,
one
of
the
best
princes
who
ever
sat
on
a
throne
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
there
against
him
?
That
throne
.
Take
away
Louis
Philippe
the
*NL*
king
,
there
remains
the
man
.
And
the
man
is
good
.
He
is
good
at
times
*NL*
even
to
the
point
of
being
admirable
.
Often
,
in
the
midst
of
his
gravest
*NL*
souvenirs
,
after
a
day
of
conflict
with
the
whole
diplomacy
of
the
*NL*
continent
,
he
returned
at
night
to
his
apartments
,
and
there
,
exhausted
*NL*
with
fatigue
,
overwhelmed
with
sleep
,
what
did
he
do
?
He
took
a
death
*NL*
sentence
and
passed
the
night
in
revising
a
criminal
suit
,
considering
*NL*
it
something
to
hold
his
own
against
Europe
,
but
that
it
was
a
still
*NL*
greater
matter
to
rescue
a
man
from
the
executioner
.
He
obstinately
*NL*
maintained
his
opinion
against
his
keeper
of
the
seals
;
he
disputed
the
*NL*
ground
with
the
guillotine
foot
by
foot
against
the
crown
attorneys
,
*NL*
those
chatterers
of
the
law
,
as
he
called
them
.
Sometimes
the
pile
of
*NL*
sentences
covered
his
table
;
he
examined
them
all
;
it
was
anguish
to
*NL*
him
to
abandon
these
miserable
,
condemned
heads
.
One
day
,
he
said
to
*NL*
the
same
witness
to
whom
we
have
recently
referred
:
``
I
won
seven
last
*NL*
night
.
''
During
the
early
years
of
his
reign
,
the
death
penalty
was
*NL*
as
good
as
abolished
,
and
the
erection
of
a
scaffold
was
a
violence
*NL*
committed
against
the
King
.
The
Greve
having
disappeared
with
the
elder
*NL*
branch
,
a
bourgeois
place
of
execution
was
instituted
under
the
name
*NL*
of
the
Barriere-Saint-Jacques
;
``
practical
men
''
felt
the
necessity
of
*NL*
a
quasi-legitimate
guillotine
;
and
this
was
one
of
the
victories
of
*NL*
Casimir
Perier
,
who
represented
the
narrow
sides
of
the
bourgeoisie
,
*NL*
over
Louis
Philippe
,
who
represented
its
liberal
sides
.
Louis
Philippe
*NL*
annotated
Beccaria
with
his
own
hand
.
After
the
Fieschi
machine
,
he
*NL*
exclaimed
:
``
What
a
pity
that
I
was
not
wounded
!
Then
I
might
have
*NL*
pardoned
!
''
On
another
occasion
,
alluding
to
the
resistance
offered
by
*NL*
his
ministry
,
he
wrote
in
connection
with
a
political
criminal
,
who
is
*NL*
one
of
the
most
generous
figures
of
our
day
:
``
His
pardon
is
granted
;
it
*NL*
only
remains
for
me
to
obtain
it
.
''
Louis
Philippe
was
as
gentle
as
Louis
*NL*
IX
.
and
as
kindly
as
Henri
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
to
our
mind
,
in
history
,
where
kindness
is
the
rarest
of
pearls
,
*NL*
the
man
who
is
kindly
almost
takes
precedence
of
the
man
who
is
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
Philippe
having
been
severely
judged
by
some
,
harshly
,
perhaps
,
by
*NL*
others
,
it
is
quite
natural
that
a
man
,
himself
a
phantom
at
the
present
*NL*
day
,
who
knew
that
king
,
should
come
and
testify
in
his
favor
before
*NL*
history
;
this
deposition
,
whatever
else
it
may
be
,
is
evidently
and
*NL*
above
all
things
,
entirely
disinterested
;
an
epitaph
penned
by
a
dead
*NL*
man
is
sincere
;
one
shade
may
console
another
shade
;
the
sharing
of
the
*NL*
same
shadows
confers
the
right
to
praise
it
;
it
is
not
greatly
to
*NL*
be
feared
that
it
will
ever
be
said
of
two
tombs
in
exile
:
``
This
one
*NL*
flattered
the
other
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
CRACKS
BENEATH
THE
FOUNDATION
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
drama
which
we
are
narrating
is
on
the
point
of
*NL*
penetrating
into
the
depths
of
one
of
the
tragic
clouds
which
envelop
*NL*
the
beginning
of
Louis
Philippe
's
reign
,
it
was
necessary
that
there
*NL*
should
be
no
equivoque
,
and
it
became
requisite
that
this
book
should
*NL*
offer
some
explanation
with
regard
to
this
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
Louis
Philippe
had
entered
into
possession
of
his
royal
authority
*NL*
without
violence
,
without
any
direct
action
on
his
part
,
by
virtue
of
a
*NL*
revolutionary
change
,
evidently
quite
distinct
from
the
real
aim
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
,
but
in
which
he
,
the
Duc
d'Orleans
,
exercised
no
personal
*NL*
initiative
.
He
had
been
born
a
Prince
,
and
he
believed
himself
to
have
*NL*
been
elected
King
.
He
had
not
served
this
mandate
on
himself
;
he
had
not
*NL*
taken
it
;
it
had
been
offered
to
him
,
and
he
had
accepted
it
;
convinced
,
*NL*
wrongly
,
to
be
sure
,
but
convinced
nevertheless
,
that
the
offer
was
in
*NL*
accordance
with
right
and
that
the
acceptance
of
it
was
in
accordance
*NL*
with
duty
.
Hence
his
possession
was
in
good
faith
.
Now
,
we
say
it
in
*NL*
good
conscience
,
Louis
Philippe
being
in
possession
in
perfect
good
*NL*
faith
,
and
the
democracy
being
in
good
faith
in
its
attack
,
the
amount
*NL*
of
terror
discharged
by
the
social
conflicts
weighs
neither
on
the
*NL*
King
nor
on
the
democracy
.
A
clash
of
principles
resembles
a
clash
of
*NL*
elements
.
The
ocean
defends
the
water
,
the
hurricane
defends
the
*NL*
air
,
the
King
defends
Royalty
,
the
democracy
defends
the
people
;
the
*NL*
relative
,
which
is
the
monarchy
,
resists
the
absolute
,
which
is
the
*NL*
republic
;
society
bleeds
in
this
conflict
,
but
that
which
constitutes
*NL*
its
suffering
to-day
will
constitute
its
safety
later
on
;
and
,
in
any
*NL*
case
,
those
who
combat
are
not
to
be
blamed
;
one
of
the
two
parties
is
*NL*
evidently
mistaken
;
the
right
is
not
,
like
the
Colossus
of
Rhodes
,
on
*NL*
two
shores
at
once
,
with
one
foot
on
the
republic
,
and
one
in
Royalty
;
*NL*
it
is
indivisible
,
and
all
on
one
side
;
but
those
who
are
in
error
are
*NL*
so
sincerely
;
a
blind
man
is
no
more
a
criminal
than
a
Vendean
is
a
*NL*
ruffian
.
Let
us
,
then
,
impute
to
the
fatality
of
things
alone
these
*NL*
formidable
collisions
.
Whatever
the
nature
of
these
tempests
may
be
,
*NL*
human
irresponsibility
is
mingled
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
complete
this
exposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
government
of
1830
led
a
hard
life
immediately
.
Born
yesterday
,
it
*NL*
was
obliged
to
fight
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
installed
,
it
was
already
everywhere
conscious
of
vague
movements
*NL*
of
traction
on
the
apparatus
of
July
so
recently
laid
,
and
so
lacking
in
*NL*
solidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Resistance
was
born
on
the
morrow
;
perhaps
even
,
it
was
born
on
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
.
From
month
to
month
the
hostility
increased
,
and
from
*NL*
being
concealed
it
became
patent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Revolution
of
July
,
which
gained
but
little
acceptance
outside
of
*NL*
France
by
kings
,
had
been
diversely
interpreted
in
France
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
delivers
over
to
men
his
visible
will
in
events
,
an
obscure
text
*NL*
written
in
a
mysterious
tongue
.
Men
immediately
make
translations
of
it
;
*NL*
translations
hasty
,
incorrect
,
full
of
errors
,
of
gaps
,
and
of
nonsense
.
*NL*
Very
few
minds
comprehend
the
divine
language
.
The
most
sagacious
,
the
*NL*
calmest
,
the
most
profound
,
decipher
slowly
,
and
when
they
arrive
with
*NL*
their
text
,
the
task
has
long
been
completed
;
there
are
already
twenty
*NL*
translations
on
the
public
place
.
From
each
remaining
springs
a
party
,
*NL*
and
from
each
misinterpretation
a
faction
;
and
each
party
thinks
that
it
*NL*
alone
has
the
true
text
,
and
each
faction
thinks
that
it
possesses
the
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Power
itself
is
often
a
faction
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
,
in
revolutions
,
swimmers
who
go
against
the
current
;
they
are
*NL*
the
old
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
old
parties
who
clung
to
heredity
by
the
grace
of
God
,
think
*NL*
that
revolutions
,
having
sprung
from
the
right
to
revolt
,
one
has
the
*NL*
right
to
revolt
against
them
.
Error
.
For
in
these
revolutions
,
the
one
*NL*
who
revolts
is
not
the
people
;
it
is
the
king
.
Revolution
is
precisely
*NL*
the
contrary
of
revolt
.
Every
revolution
,
being
a
normal
outcome
,
*NL*
contains
within
itself
its
legitimacy
,
which
false
revolutionists
*NL*
sometimes
dishonor
,
but
which
remains
even
when
soiled
,
which
survives
*NL*
even
when
stained
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revolutions
spring
not
from
an
accident
,
but
from
necessity
.
A
*NL*
revolution
is
a
return
from
the
fictitious
to
the
real
.
It
is
because
it
*NL*
must
be
that
it
is
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
the
less
did
the
old
legitimist
parties
assail
the
Revolution
of
*NL*
1830
with
all
the
vehemence
which
arises
from
false
reasoning
.
Errors
*NL*
make
excellent
projectiles
.
They
strike
it
cleverly
in
its
vulnerable
*NL*
spot
,
in
default
of
a
cuirass
,
in
its
lack
of
logic
;
they
attacked
this
*NL*
revolution
in
its
royalty
.
They
shouted
to
it
:
``
Revolution
,
why
this
*NL*
king
?
''
Factions
are
blind
men
who
aim
correctly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
cry
was
uttered
equally
by
the
republicans
.
But
coming
from
*NL*
them
,
this
cry
was
logical
.
What
was
blindness
in
the
legitimists
was
*NL*
clearness
of
vision
in
the
democrats
.
1830
had
bankrupted
the
people
.
*NL*
The
enraged
democracy
reproached
it
with
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
the
attack
of
the
past
and
the
attack
of
the
future
,
the
*NL*
establishment
of
July
struggled
.
It
represented
the
minute
at
*NL*
loggerheads
on
the
one
hand
with
the
monarchical
centuries
,
on
the
other
*NL*
hand
with
eternal
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
,
and
beside
all
this
,
as
it
was
no
longer
revolution
and
had
*NL*
become
a
monarchy
,
1830
was
obliged
to
take
precedence
of
all
Europe
.
To
*NL*
keep
the
peace
,
was
an
increase
of
complication
.
A
harmony
established
*NL*
contrary
to
sense
is
often
more
onerous
than
a
war
.
From
this
secret
*NL*
conflict
,
always
muzzled
,
but
always
growling
,
was
born
armed
peace
,
*NL*
that
ruinous
expedient
of
civilization
which
in
the
harness
of
the
*NL*
European
cabinets
is
suspicious
in
itself
.
The
Royalty
of
July
reared
*NL*
up
,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
caught
it
in
the
harness
of
European
*NL*
cabinets
.
Metternich
would
gladly
have
put
it
in
kicking-straps
.
Pushed
*NL*
on
in
France
by
progress
,
it
pushed
on
the
monarchies
,
those
loiterers
*NL*
in
Europe
.
After
having
been
towed
,
it
undertook
to
tow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
within
her
,
pauperism
,
the
proletariat
,
salary
,
education
,
*NL*
penal
servitude
,
prostitution
,
the
fate
of
the
woman
,
wealth
,
misery
,
*NL*
production
,
consumption
,
division
,
exchange
,
coin
,
credit
,
the
rights
of
*NL*
capital
,
the
rights
of
labor
,
--
all
these
questions
were
multiplied
above
*NL*
society
,
a
terrible
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
of
political
parties
properly
so
called
,
another
movement
became
*NL*
manifest
.
Philosophical
fermentation
replied
to
democratic
fermentation
.
*NL*
The
elect
felt
troubled
as
well
as
the
masses
;
in
another
manner
,
but
*NL*
quite
as
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinkers
meditated
,
while
the
soil
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
people
,
*NL*
traversed
by
revolutionary
currents
,
trembled
under
them
with
*NL*
indescribably
vague
epileptic
shocks
.
These
dreamers
,
some
isolated
,
*NL*
others
united
in
families
and
almost
in
communion
,
turned
over
social
*NL*
questions
in
a
pacific
but
profound
manner
;
impassive
miners
,
who
*NL*
tranquilly
pushed
their
galleries
into
the
depths
of
a
volcano
,
hardly
*NL*
disturbed
by
the
dull
commotion
and
the
furnaces
of
which
they
caught
*NL*
glimpses
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
tranquillity
was
not
the
least
beautiful
spectacle
of
this
agitated
*NL*
epoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
men
left
to
political
parties
the
question
of
rights
,
they
*NL*
occupied
themselves
with
the
question
of
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
well-being
of
man
,
that
was
what
they
wanted
to
extract
from
*NL*
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
raised
material
questions
,
questions
of
agriculture
,
of
industry
,
*NL*
of
commerce
,
almost
to
the
dignity
of
a
religion
.
In
civilization
,
such
*NL*
as
it
has
formed
itself
,
a
little
by
the
command
of
God
,
a
great
deal
by
*NL*
the
agency
of
man
,
interests
combine
,
unite
,
and
amalgamate
in
a
*NL*
manner
to
form
a
veritable
hard
rock
,
in
accordance
with
a
dynamic
law
,
*NL*
patiently
studied
by
economists
,
those
geologists
of
politics
.
These
men
*NL*
who
grouped
themselves
under
different
appellations
,
but
who
may
all
be
*NL*
designated
by
the
generic
title
of
socialists
,
endeavored
to
pierce
that
*NL*
rock
and
to
cause
it
to
spout
forth
the
living
waters
of
human
felicity
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
question
of
the
scaffold
to
the
question
of
war
,
their
works
*NL*
embraced
everything
.
To
the
rights
of
man
,
as
proclaimed
by
the
French
*NL*
Revolution
,
they
added
the
rights
of
woman
and
the
rights
of
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
not
be
surprised
if
,
for
various
reasons
,
we
do
not
*NL*
here
treat
in
a
thorough
manner
,
from
the
theoretical
point
of
view
,
the
*NL*
questions
raised
by
socialism
.
We
confine
ourselves
to
indicating
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
problems
that
the
socialists
proposed
to
themselves
,
cosmogonic
*NL*
visions
,
revery
and
mysticism
being
cast
aside
,
can
be
reduced
to
two
*NL*
principal
problems
.
*NL*
*NL*
First
problem
:
To
produce
wealth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Second
problem
:
To
share
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
problem
contains
the
question
of
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
contains
the
question
of
salary
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
problem
the
employment
of
forces
is
in
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
,
the
distribution
of
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
proper
employment
of
forces
results
public
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
good
distribution
of
enjoyments
results
individual
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
good
distribution
,
not
an
equal
but
an
equitable
distribution
must
*NL*
be
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
these
two
things
combined
,
the
public
power
without
,
individual
*NL*
happiness
within
,
results
social
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Social
prosperity
means
the
man
happy
,
the
citizen
free
,
the
nation
*NL*
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
England
solves
the
first
of
these
two
problems
.
She
creates
wealth
*NL*
admirably
,
she
divides
it
badly
.
This
solution
which
is
complete
on
*NL*
one
side
only
leads
her
fatally
to
two
extremes
:
monstrous
opulence
,
*NL*
monstrous
wretchedness
.
All
enjoyments
for
some
,
all
privations
for
the
*NL*
rest
,
that
is
to
say
,
for
the
people
;
privilege
,
exception
,
monopoly
,
*NL*
feudalism
,
born
from
toil
itself
.
A
false
and
dangerous
situation
,
which
*NL*
sates
public
power
or
private
misery
,
which
sets
the
roots
of
the
State
*NL*
in
the
sufferings
of
the
individual
.
A
badly
constituted
grandeur
in
*NL*
which
are
combined
all
the
material
elements
and
into
which
no
moral
*NL*
element
enters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Communism
and
agrarian
law
think
that
they
solve
the
second
problem
.
*NL*
They
are
mistaken
.
Their
division
kills
production
.
Equal
partition
*NL*
abolishes
emulation
;
and
consequently
labor
.
It
is
a
partition
made
*NL*
by
the
butcher
,
which
kills
that
which
it
divides
.
It
is
therefore
*NL*
impossible
to
pause
over
these
pretended
solutions
.
Slaying
wealth
is
*NL*
not
the
same
thing
as
dividing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
problems
require
to
be
solved
together
,
to
be
well
solved
.
The
*NL*
two
problems
must
be
combined
and
made
but
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Solve
only
the
first
of
the
two
problems
;
you
will
be
Venice
,
you
will
*NL*
be
England
.
You
will
have
,
like
Venice
,
an
artificial
power
,
or
,
like
*NL*
England
,
a
material
power
;
you
will
be
the
wicked
rich
man
.
You
will
die
*NL*
by
an
act
of
violence
,
as
Venice
died
,
or
by
bankruptcy
,
as
England
*NL*
will
fall
.
And
the
world
will
allow
to
die
and
fall
all
that
is
merely
*NL*
selfishness
,
all
that
does
not
represent
for
the
human
race
either
a
*NL*
virtue
or
an
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
well
understood
here
,
that
by
the
words
Venice
,
England
,
we
*NL*
designate
not
the
peoples
,
but
social
structures
;
the
oligarchies
*NL*
superposed
on
nations
,
and
not
the
nations
themselves
.
The
nations
*NL*
always
have
our
respect
and
our
sympathy
.
Venice
,
as
a
people
,
will
live
*NL*
again
;
England
,
the
aristocracy
,
will
fall
,
but
England
,
the
nation
,
is
*NL*
immortal
.
That
said
,
we
continue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Solve
the
two
problems
,
encourage
the
wealthy
,
and
protect
the
poor
,
*NL*
suppress
misery
,
put
an
end
to
the
unjust
farming
out
of
the
feeble
by
*NL*
the
strong
,
put
a
bridle
on
the
iniquitous
jealousy
of
the
man
who
*NL*
is
making
his
way
against
the
man
who
has
reached
the
goal
,
adjust
,
*NL*
mathematically
and
fraternally
,
salary
to
labor
,
mingle
gratuitous
and
*NL*
compulsory
education
with
the
growth
of
childhood
,
and
make
of
science
*NL*
the
base
of
manliness
,
develop
minds
while
keeping
arms
busy
,
be
at
one
*NL*
and
the
same
time
a
powerful
people
and
a
family
of
happy
men
,
render
*NL*
property
democratic
,
not
by
abolishing
it
,
but
by
making
it
universal
,
*NL*
so
that
every
citizen
,
without
exception
,
may
be
a
proprietor
,
an
easier
*NL*
matter
than
is
generally
supposed
;
in
two
words
,
learn
how
to
produce
*NL*
wealth
and
how
to
distribute
it
,
and
you
will
have
at
once
moral
and
*NL*
material
greatness
;
and
you
will
be
worthy
to
call
yourself
France
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
socialism
said
outside
and
above
a
few
sects
which
have
*NL*
gone
astray
;
that
is
what
it
sought
in
facts
,
that
is
what
it
sketched
*NL*
out
in
minds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Efforts
worthy
of
admiration
!
Sacred
attempts
!
*NL*
*NL*
These
doctrines
,
these
theories
,
these
resistances
,
the
unforeseen
*NL*
necessity
for
the
statesman
to
take
philosophers
into
account
,
confused
*NL*
evidences
of
which
we
catch
a
glimpse
,
a
new
system
of
politics
to
be
*NL*
created
,
which
shall
be
in
accord
with
the
old
world
without
too
much
*NL*
disaccord
with
the
new
revolutionary
ideal
,
a
situation
in
which
it
*NL*
became
necessary
to
use
Lafayette
to
defend
Polignac
,
the
intuition
of
*NL*
progress
transparent
beneath
the
revolt
,
the
chambers
and
streets
,
the
*NL*
competitions
to
be
brought
into
equilibrium
around
him
,
his
faith
in
*NL*
the
Revolution
,
perhaps
an
eventual
indefinable
resignation
born
of
the
*NL*
vague
acceptance
of
a
superior
definitive
right
,
his
desire
to
remain
of
*NL*
his
race
,
his
domestic
spirit
,
his
sincere
respect
for
the
people
,
his
*NL*
own
honesty
,
preoccupied
Louis
Philippe
almost
painfully
,
and
there
were
*NL*
moments
when
strong
and
courageous
as
he
was
,
he
was
overwhelmed
by
the
*NL*
difficulties
of
being
a
king
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
under
his
feet
a
formidable
disaggregation
,
which
was
not
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
a
reduction
to
dust
,
France
being
more
France
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Piles
of
shadows
covered
the
horizon
.
A
strange
shade
,
gradually
drawing
*NL*
nearer
,
extended
little
by
little
over
men
,
over
things
,
over
ideas
;
*NL*
a
shade
which
came
from
wraths
and
systems
.
Everything
which
had
been
*NL*
hastily
stifled
was
moving
and
fermenting
.
At
times
the
conscience
of
*NL*
the
honest
man
resumed
its
breathing
,
so
great
was
the
discomfort
*NL*
of
that
air
in
which
sophisms
were
intermingled
with
truths
.
Spirits
*NL*
trembled
in
the
social
anxiety
like
leaves
at
the
approach
of
a
storm
.
*NL*
The
electric
tension
was
such
that
at
certain
instants
,
the
first
comer
,
*NL*
a
stranger
,
brought
light
.
Then
the
twilight
obscurity
closed
in
again
.
*NL*
At
intervals
,
deep
and
dull
mutterings
allowed
a
judgment
to
be
formed
*NL*
as
to
the
quantity
of
thunder
contained
by
the
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
months
had
barely
elapsed
since
the
Revolution
of
July
,
the
year
*NL*
1832
had
opened
with
an
aspect
of
something
impending
and
threatening
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
distress
of
the
people
,
the
laborers
without
bread
,
the
last
Prince
*NL*
de
Conde
engulfed
in
the
shadows
,
Brussels
expelling
the
Nassaus
as
*NL*
Paris
did
the
Bourbons
,
Belgium
offering
herself
to
a
French
Prince
*NL*
and
giving
herself
to
an
English
Prince
,
the
Russian
hatred
of
Nicolas
,
*NL*
behind
us
the
demons
of
the
South
,
Ferdinand
in
Spain
,
Miguel
in
*NL*
Portugal
,
the
earth
quaking
in
Italy
,
Metternich
extending
his
hand
over
*NL*
Bologna
,
France
treating
Austria
sharply
at
Ancona
,
at
the
North
no
one
*NL*
knew
what
sinister
sound
of
the
hammer
nailing
up
Poland
in
her
coffin
,
*NL*
irritated
glances
watching
France
narrowly
all
over
Europe
,
England
,
a
*NL*
suspected
ally
,
ready
to
give
a
push
to
that
which
was
tottering
and
to
*NL*
hurl
herself
on
that
which
should
fall
,
the
peerage
sheltering
itself
*NL*
behind
Beccaria
to
refuse
four
heads
to
the
law
,
the
fleurs-de-lys
*NL*
erased
from
the
King
's
carriage
,
the
cross
torn
from
Notre
Dame
,
*NL*
Lafayette
lessened
,
Laffitte
ruined
,
Benjamin
Constant
dead
in
*NL*
indigence
,
Casimir
Perier
dead
in
the
exhaustion
of
his
power
;
political
*NL*
and
social
malady
breaking
out
simultaneously
in
the
two
capitals
of
the
*NL*
kingdom
,
the
one
in
the
city
of
thought
,
the
other
in
the
city
of
toil
;
*NL*
at
Paris
civil
war
,
at
Lyons
servile
war
;
in
the
two
cities
,
the
same
*NL*
glare
of
the
furnace
;

FACTS
WHENCE
HISTORY
SPRINGS
AND
WHICH
HISTORY
IGNORES
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
April
,
everything
had
become
aggravated
.
The
*NL*
fermentation
entered
the
boiling
state
.
Ever
since
1830
,
petty
partial
*NL*
revolts
had
been
going
on
here
and
there
,
which
were
quickly
suppressed
,
*NL*
but
ever
bursting
forth
afresh
,
the
sign
of
a
vast
underlying
*NL*
conflagration
.
Something
terrible
was
in
preparation
.
Glimpses
could
be
*NL*
caught
of
the
features
still
indistinct
and
imperfectly
lighted
,
of
a
*NL*
possible
revolution
.
France
kept
an
eye
on
Paris
;
Paris
kept
an
eye
on
*NL*
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
,
which
was
in
a
dull
glow
,
was
beginning
its
*NL*
ebullition
.

*NL*
The
wine-shops
of
the
Rue
de
Charonne
were
,
although
the
union
of
*NL*
the
two
epithets
seems
singular
when
applied
to
wine-shops
,
grave
and
*NL*
stormy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
government
was
there
purely
and
simply
called
in
question
.
There
*NL*
people
publicly
discussed
the
question
of
fighting
or
of
keeping
quiet
.
*NL*
There
were
back
shops
where
workingmen
were
made
to
swear
that
they
*NL*
would
hasten
into
the
street
at
the
first
cry
of
alarm
,
and
``
that
they
*NL*
would
fight
without
counting
the
number
of
the
enemy
.
''
This
engagement
*NL*
once
entered
into
,
a
man
seated
in
the
corner
of
the
wine-shop
``
assumed
*NL*
a
sonorous
tone
,
''
and
said
,
``
You
understand
!
You
have
sworn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
they
went
up
stairs
,
to
a
private
room
on
the
first
floor
,
*NL*
and
there
scenes
that
were
almost
masonic
were
enacted
.
They
made
the
*NL*
initiated
take
oaths
to
render
service
to
himself
as
well
as
to
the
*NL*
fathers
of
families
.
That
was
the
formula
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
tap-rooms
,
``
subversive
''
pamphlets
were
read
.
They
treated
the
*NL*
government
with
contempt
,
says
a
secret
report
of
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Words
like
the
following
could
be
heard
there
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
the
names
of
the
leaders
.
We
folks
shall
not
know
the
day
*NL*
until
two
hours
beforehand
.
''
One
workman
said
:
``
There
are
three
hundred
*NL*
of
us
,
let
each
contribute
ten
sous
,
that
will
make
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
francs
with
which
to
procure
powder
and
shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
said
:
``
I
do
n't
ask
for
six
months
,
I
do
n't
ask
for
even
two
.
*NL*
In
less
than
a
fortnight
we
shall
be
parallel
with
the
government
.
With
*NL*
twenty-five
thousand
men
we
can
face
them
.
''
Another
said
:
``
I
do
n't
sleep
*NL*
at
night
,
because
I
make
cartridges
all
night
.
''
From
time
to
time
,
*NL*
men
``
of
bourgeois
appearance
,
and
in
good
coats
''
came
and
``
caused
*NL*
embarrassment
,
''
and
with
the
air
of
``
command
,
''
shook
hands
with
the
most
*NL*
important
,
and
then
went
away
.
They
never
stayed
more
than
ten
minutes
.
*NL*
Significant
remarks
were
exchanged
in
a
low
tone
:
``
The
plot
is
ripe
,
the
*NL*
matter
is
arranged
.
''
``
It
was
murmured
by
all
who
were
there
,
''
to
borrow
*NL*
the
very
expression
of
one
of
those
who
were
present
.
The
exaltation
was
*NL*
such
that
one
day
,
a
workingman
exclaimed
,
before
the
whole
wine-shop
:
*NL*
``
We
have
no
arms
!
''
One
of
his
comrades
replied
:
``
The
soldiers
have
!
''
*NL*
thus
parodying
without
being
aware
of
the
fact
,
Bonaparte
's
proclamation
*NL*
to
the
army
in
Italy
:
``
When
they
had
anything
of
a
more
secret
nature
on
*NL*
hand
,
''
adds
one
report
,
``
they
did
not
communicate
it
to
each
other
.
''
It
*NL*
is
not
easy
to
understand
what
they
could
conceal
after
what
they
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
reunions
were
sometimes
periodical
.
At
certain
ones
of
them
,
there
*NL*
were
never
more
than
eight
or
ten
persons
present
,
and
they
were
always
*NL*
the
same
.
In
others
,
any
one
entered
who
wished
,
and
the
room
was
*NL*
so
full
that
they
were
forced
to
stand
.
Some
went
thither
through
*NL*
enthusiasm
and
passion
;
others
because
it
was
on
their
way
to
their
*NL*
work
.
As
during
the
Revolution
,
there
were
patriotic
women
in
some
of
*NL*
these
wine-shops
who
embraced
new-comers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
expressive
facts
came
to
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
would
enter
a
shop
,
drink
,
and
go
his
way
with
the
remark
:
*NL*
``
Wine-merchant
,
the
revolution
will
pay
what
is
due
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Revolutionary
agents
were
appointed
in
a
wine-shop
facing
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Charonne
.
The
balloting
was
carried
on
in
their
caps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Workingmen
met
at
the
house
of
a
fencing-master
who
gave
lessons
in
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Cotte
.
There
there
was
a
trophy
of
arms
formed
of
wooden
*NL*
broadswords
,
canes
,
clubs
,
and
foils
.
One
day
,
the
buttons
were
removed
*NL*
from
the
foils
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
workman
said
:
``
There
are
twenty-five
of
us
,
but
they
do
n't
count
*NL*
on
me
,
because
I
am
looked
upon
as
a
machine
.
''
Later
on
,
that
machine
*NL*
became
Quenisset
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
indefinite
things
which
were
brewing
gradually
acquired
a
strange
*NL*
and
indescribable
notoriety
.
A
woman
sweeping
off
her
doorsteps
said
*NL*
to
another
woman
:
``
For
a
long
time
,
there
has
been
a
strong
force
busy
*NL*
making
cartridges
.
''
In
the
open
street
,
proclamation
could
be
seen
*NL*
addressed
to
the
National
Guard
in
the
departments
.
One
of
these
*NL*
proclamations
was
signed
:
Burtot
,
wine-merchant
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
a
man
with
his
beard
worn
like
a
collar
and
with
an
Italian
*NL*
accent
mounted
a
stone
post
at
the
door
of
a
liquor-seller
in
the
Marche
*NL*
Lenoir
,
and
read
aloud
a
singular
document
,
which
seemed
to
emanate
from
*NL*
an
occult
power
.
Groups
formed
around
him
,
and
applauded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
passages
which
touched
the
crowd
most
deeply
were
collected
and
*NL*
noted
down
.
''
--
Our
doctrines
are
trammelled
,
our
proclamations
torn
,
our
*NL*
bill-stickers
are
spied
upon
and
thrown
into
prison
.
''
--
``
The
breakdown
*NL*
which
has
recently
taken
place
in
cottons
has
converted
to
us
many
*NL*
mediums
.
''
--
``
The
future
of
nations
is
being
worked
out
in
our
obscure
*NL*
ranks
.
''
--
``
Here
are
the
fixed
terms
:
action
or
reaction
,
revolution
or
*NL*
counter-revolution
.
For
,
at
our
epoch
,
we
no
longer
believe
either
in
*NL*
inertia
or
in
immobility
.
For
the
people
against
the
people
,
that
is
the
*NL*
question
.
There
is
no
other
.
''
--
``
On
the
day
when
we
cease
to
suit
you
,
*NL*
break
us
,
but
up
to
that
day
,
help
us
to
march
on
.
''
All
this
in
broad
*NL*
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
deeds
,
more
audacious
still
,
were
suspicious
in
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
people
by
reason
of
their
very
audacity
.
On
the
4th
of
April
,
1832
,
a
*NL*
passer-by
mounted
the
post
on
the
corner
which
forms
the
angle
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Sainte-Marguerite
and
shouted
:
``
I
am
a
Babouvist
!
''
But
beneath
*NL*
Babeuf
,
the
people
scented
Gisquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
other
things
,
this
man
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
with
property
!
The
opposition
of
the
left
is
cowardly
and
*NL*
treacherous
.
When
it
wants
to
be
on
the
right
side
,
it
preaches
*NL*
revolution
,
it
is
democratic
in
order
to
escape
being
beaten
,
and
*NL*
royalist
so
that
it
may
not
have
to
fight
.
The
republicans
are
beasts
*NL*
with
feathers
.
Distrust
the
republicans
,
citizens
of
the
laboring
*NL*
classes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
,
citizen
spy
!
''
cried
an
artisan
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
shout
put
an
end
to
the
discourse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mysterious
incidents
occurred
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
nightfall
,
a
workingman
encountered
near
the
canal
a
``
very
well
*NL*
dressed
man
,
''
who
said
to
him
:
``
Whither
are
you
bound
,
citizen
?
''
``
Sir
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
workingman
,
``
I
have
not
the
honor
of
your
acquaintance
.
''
``
I
*NL*
know
you
very
well
,
however
.
''
And
the
man
added
:
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed
,
I
*NL*
am
an
agent
of
the
committee
.
You
are
suspected
of
not
being
quite
*NL*
faithful
.
You
know
that
if
you
reveal
anything
,
there
is
an
eye
fixed
on
*NL*
you
.
''
Then
he
shook
hands
with
the
workingman
and
went
away
,
saying
:
``
We
*NL*
shall
meet
again
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
police
,
who
were
on
the
alert
,
collected
singular
dialogues
,
not
*NL*
only
in
the
wine-shops
,
but
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
yourself
received
very
soon
,
''
said
a
weaver
to
a
cabinet-maker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
going
to
be
a
shot
to
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
ragged
pedestrians
exchanged
these
remarkable
replies
,
fraught
with
*NL*
evident
Jacquerie
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
governs
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Philippe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
the
bourgeoisie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
is
mistaken
if
he
thinks
that
we
take
the
word
Jacquerie
in
a
*NL*
bad
sense
.
The
Jacques
were
the
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
two
men
were
heard
to
say
to
each
other
as
they
*NL*
passed
by
:
``
We
have
a
good
plan
of
attack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
the
following
was
caught
of
a
private
conversation
between
four
men
*NL*
who
were
crouching
in
a
ditch
of
the
circle
of
the
Barriere
du
Trone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
possible
will
be
done
to
prevent
his
walking
about
Paris
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
the
he
?
Menacing
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
principal
leaders
,
''
as
they
said
in
the
faubourg
,
held
themselves
*NL*
apart
.
It
was
supposed
that
they
met
for
consultation
in
a
wine-shop
*NL*
near
the
point
Saint-Eustache
.
A
certain
Aug
--
,
chief
of
the
Society
*NL*
aid
for
tailors
,
Rue
Mondetour
,
had
the
reputation
of
serving
as
*NL*
intermediary
central
between
the
leaders
and
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
there
was
always
a
great
deal
of
mystery
about
these
*NL*
leaders
,
and
no
certain
fact
can
invalidate
the
singular
arrogance
of
*NL*
this
reply
made
later
on
by
a
man
accused
before
the
Court
of
Peers
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
your
leader
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
of
none
and
I
recognized
none
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
but
words
,
transparent
but
vague
;
sometimes
idle
*NL*
reports
,
rumors
,
hearsay
.
Other
indications
cropped
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
carpenter
,
occupied
in
nailing
boards
to
a
fence
around
the
ground
*NL*
on
which
a
house
was
in
process
of
construction
,
in
the
Rue
de
Reuilly
*NL*
found
on
that
plot
the
torn
fragment
of
a
letter
on
which
were
still
*NL*
legible
the
following
lines
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
committee
must
take
measures
to
prevent
recruiting
in
the
sections
*NL*
for
the
different
societies
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
as
a
postscript
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
learned
that
there
are
guns
in
the
Rue
du
Faubourg-Poissonniere
,
*NL*
No.

,
to
the
number
of

in

house
of
a
*NL*
gunsmith
in
that
court
.
The
section
owns
no
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
excited
the
carpenter
and
caused
him
to
show
this
thing
to
his
*NL*
neighbors
was
the
fact
,
that
a
few
paces
further
on
he
picked
up
another
*NL*
paper
,
torn
like
the
first
,
and
still
more
significant
,
of
which
we
*NL*
reproduce
a
facsimile
,
because
of
the
historical
interest
attaching
to
*NL*
these
strange
documents

It
was
only
later
on
that
the
persons
who
were
in
the
secret
of
this
*NL*
find
at
the
time
,
learned
the
significance
of
those
four
capital
*NL*
letters
:
quinturions

centurions

the

which

a

meant
April

capital

were
inscribed

very

Finally

this

found
,
still
in
the

,
a
third

on
which
was
written
in

,
but
very
legibly
,
this

The
honest
bourgeois
into
whose
hands
this
list
fell
knew
its
*NL*
significance
.
It
appears
that
this
list
was
the
complete
nomenclature
of
*NL*
the
sections
of
the
fourth
arondissement
of
the
Society
of
the
Rights
*NL*
of
Man
,
with
the
names
and
dwellings
of
the
chiefs
of
sections
.
To-day
,
*NL*
when
all
these
facts
which
were
obscure
are
nothing
more
than
history
,
*NL*
we
may
publish
them
.
It
should
be
added
,
that
the
foundation
of
the
*NL*
Society
of
the
Rights
of
Man
seems
to
have
been
posterior
to
the
date
*NL*
when
this
paper
was
found
.
Perhaps
this
was
only
a
rough
draft
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
according
to
all
the
remarks
and
the
words
,
according
to
written
*NL*
notes
,
material
facts
begin
to
make
their
appearance
.

*NL*
In
the
Rue
Popincourt
,
in
the
house
of
a
dealer
in
bric-abrac
,
there
*NL*
were
seized
seven
sheets
of
gray
paper
,
all
folded
alike
lengthwise
*NL*
and
in
four
;
these
sheets
enclosed
twenty-six
squares
of
this
same
*NL*
gray
paper
folded
in
the
form
of
a
cartridge
,
and
a
card
,
on
which
was
*NL*
written
the
following
:
--

The
report
of
the
seizure
stated
that
the

exhaled
a
strong
smell
*NL*
of

A
mason
returning
from
his
day
's
work
,
left
behind
him
a
little
package
*NL*
on
a
bench
near
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
.
This
package
was
taken
to
*NL*
the
police
station
.
It
was
opened
,
and
in
it
were
found
two
printed
*NL*
dialogues
,
signed
Lahautiere
,
a
song
entitled
:
``
Workmen
,
band
together
,
''
*NL*
and
a
tin
box
full
of
cartridges
.

One
artisan
drinking
with
a
comrade
made
the
latter
feel
him
to
see
how
*NL*
warm
he
was
;
the
other
man
felt
a
pistol
under
his
waistcoat
.

In
a
ditch
on
the
boulevard
,
between
Pere-Lachaise
and
the
Barriere
*NL*
du
Trone
,
at
the
most
deserted
spot
,
some
children
,
while
playing
,
*NL*
discovered
beneath
a
mass
of
shavings
and
refuse
bits
of
wood
,
a
*NL*
bag
containing
a
bullet-mould
,
a
wooden
punch
for
the
preparation
of
*NL*
cartridges
,
a
wooden
bowl
,
in
which
there
were
grains
of
hunting-powder
,
*NL*
and
a
little
cast-iron
pot
whose
interior
presented
evident
traces
of
*NL*
melted
lead
.

*NL*
Police
agents
,
making
their
way
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
at
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
into
the
dwelling
of
a
certain
Pardon
,
who
*NL*
was
afterwards
a
member
of
the
Barricade-Merry
section
and
got
himself
*NL*
killed
in
the
insurrection
of
April
,
1834
,
found
him
standing
near
his
*NL*
bed
,
and
holding
in
his
hand
some
cartridges
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
*NL*
preparing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
hour
when
workingmen
repose
,
two
men
were
seen
to
meet
*NL*
between
the
Barriere
Picpus
and
the
Barriere
Charenton
in
a
little
lane
*NL*
between
two
walls
,
near
a
wine-shop
,
in
front
of
which
there
was
a
``

Siam

One
drew
a
pistol
from
beneath
his
blouse
and
handed
it
to
*NL*
the
other
.
As
he
was
handing
it
to
him
,
he
noticed
that
the
perspiration
*NL*
of
his
chest
had
made
the
powder
damp
.
He
primed
the
pistol
and
added
*NL*
more
powder
to
what
was
already
in
the
pan
.
Then
the
two
men
parted
.

*NL*
A
certain
Gallais
,
afterwards
killed
in
the
Rue
Beaubourg
in
the
affair
*NL*
of
April
,
boasted
of
having
in
his
house
seven
hundred
cartridges
and
*NL*
twenty-four
flints
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
government
one
day
received
a
warning
that
arms
and
two
hundred
*NL*
thousand
cartridges
had
just
been
distributed
in
the
faubourg
.
On
*NL*
the
following
week
thirty
thousand
cartridges
were
distributed
.
The
*NL*
remarkable
point
about
it
was
,
that
the
police
were
not
able
to
seize
a
*NL*
single
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
intercepted
letter
read
:
``
The
day
is
not
far
distant
when
,
within
*NL*
four
hours
by
the
clock
,
eighty
thousand
patriots
will
be
under
arms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
fermentation
was
public
,
one
might
almost
say
tranquil
.
The
*NL*
approaching
insurrection
was
preparing
its
storm
calmly
in
the
face
of
*NL*
the
government
.
No
singularity
was
lacking
to
this
still
subterranean
*NL*
crisis
,
which
was
already
perceptible
.
The
bourgeois
talked
peaceably
to
*NL*
the
working-classes
of
what
was
in
preparation
.
They
said
:
``
How
is
the
*NL*
rising
coming
along
?
''
in
the
same
tone
in
which
they
would
have
said
:
*NL*
``
How
is
your
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
furniture-dealer
,
of
the
Rue
Moreau
,
inquired
:
``
Well
,
when
are
you
*NL*
going
to
make
the
attack
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
shop-keeper
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
attack
will
be
made
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
A
month
ago
,
there
were
fifteen
thousand
of
you
,
now
there
*NL*
are
twenty-five
thousand
.
''
He
offered
his
gun
,
and
a
neighbor
offered
a
*NL*
small
pistol
which
he
was
willing
to
sell
for
seven
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
revolutionary
fever
was
growing
.
Not
a
point
in
Paris
nor
*NL*
in
France
was
exempt
from
it
.
The
artery
was
beating
everywhere
.
Like
*NL*
those
membranes
which
arise
from
certain
inflammations
and
form
in
the
*NL*
human
body
,
the
network
of
secret
societies
began
to
spread
all
over
the
*NL*
country
.
From
the
associations
of
the
Friends
of
the
People
,
which
was
*NL*
at
the
same
time
public
and
secret
,
sprang
the
Society
of
the
Rights
of
*NL*
Man
,
which
also
dated
from
one
of
the
orders
of
the
day
:
Pluviose
,
Year
*NL*
40
of
the
republican
era
,
which
was
destined
to
survive
even
the
mandate
*NL*
of
the
Court
of
Assizes
which
pronounced
its
dissolution
,
and
which
*NL*
did
not
hesitate
to
bestow
on
its
sections
significant
names
like
the
*NL*
following
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Pikes
.
*NL*
Tocsin
.
*NL*
Signal
cannon
.
*NL*
Phrygian

.
*NL*
January

*NL*
The

.
*NL*
Forward

.
*NL*
Robespierre
.
*NL*
Level
.
*NL*
Ca
Ira
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Society
of
the
Rights
of
Man
engendered
the
Society
of
Action
.
These
*NL*
were
impatient
individuals
who
broke
away
and
hastened
ahead
.
Other
*NL*
associations
sought
to
recruit
themselves
from
the
great
mother
*NL*
societies
.
The
members
of
sections
complained
that
they
were
torn
*NL*
asunder
.
Thus
,
the
Gallic
Society
,
and
the
committee
of
organization
of
*NL*
the
Municipalities
.
Thus
the
associations
for
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
*NL*
for
individual
liberty
,
for
the
instruction
of
the
people
against
*NL*
indirect
taxes
.
Then
the
Society
of
Equal
Workingmen
which
was
divided
*NL*
into
three
fractions
,
the
levellers
,
the
communists
,
the
reformers
.
*NL*
Then
the
Army
of
the
Bastilles
,
a
sort
of
cohort
organized
on
a
military
*NL*
footing
,
four
men
commanded
by
a
corporal
,
ten
by
a
sergeant
,
twenty
by
*NL*
a
sub-lieutenant
,
forty
by
a
lieutenant
;
there
were
never
more
than
*NL*
five
men
who
knew
each
other
.
Creation
where
precaution
is
combined
with
*NL*
audacity
and
which
seemed
stamped
with
the
genius
of
Venice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
central
committee
,
which
was
at
the
head
,
had
two
arms
,
the
Society
*NL*
of
Action
,
and
the
Army
of
the
Bastilles
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
legitimist
association
,
the
Chevaliers
of
Fidelity
,
stirred
about
*NL*
among
these
the
republican
affiliations
.
It
was
denounced
and
repudiated
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Parisian
societies
had
ramifications
in
the
principal
cities
,
Lyons
,
*NL*
Nantes
,
Lille
,
Marseilles
,
and
each
had
its
Society
of
the
Rights
of
*NL*
Man
,
the
Charbonniere
,
and
The
Free
Men
.
All
had
a
revolutionary
society
*NL*
which
was
called
the
Cougourde
.
We
have
already
mentioned
this
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Paris
,
the
Faubourg
Saint-Marceau
kept
up
an
equal
buzzing
with
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
,
and
the
schools
were
no
less
moved
than
the
*NL*
faubourgs
.
A
cafe
in
the
Rue
Saint-Hyacinthe
and
the
wine-shop
of
the
*NL*
Seven
Billiards
,
Rue
des
Mathurins-Saint-Jacques
,
served
as
rallying
*NL*
points
for
the
students
.
The
Society
of
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
*NL*
affiliated
to
the
Mutualists
of
Angers
,
and
to
the
Cougourde
of
Aix
,
*NL*
met
,
as
we
have
seen
,
in
the
Cafe
Musain
.
These
same
young
men
assembled
*NL*
also
,
as
we
have
stated
already
,
in
a
restaurant
wine-shop
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Mondetour
which
was
called
Corinthe
.
These
meetings
were
secret
.
Others
*NL*
were
as
public
as
possible
,
and
the
reader
can
judge
of
their
boldness
*NL*
from
these
fragments
of
an
interrogatory
undergone
in
one
of
the
*NL*
ulterior
prosecutions
:
``
Where
was
this
meeting
held
?
''
``
In
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Paix
.
''
``
At
whose
house
?
''
``
In
the
street
.
''
``
What
sections
were
there
?
''
*NL*
``
Only
one
.
''
``
Which
?
''
``
The
Manuel
section
.
''
``
Who
was
its
leader
?
''
*NL*
``
I.
''
``
You
are
too
young
to
have
decided
alone
upon
the
bold
course
of
*NL*
attacking
the
government
.
Where
did
your
instructions
come
from
?
''
``
From
*NL*
the
central
committee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
army
was
mined
at
the
same
time
as
the
population
,
as
was
proved
*NL*
subsequently
by
the
operations
of
Beford
,
Luneville
,
and
Epinard
.
They
*NL*
counted
on
the
fifty-second
regiment
,
on
the
fifth
,
on
the
eighth
,
on
*NL*
the
thirty-seventh
,
and
on
the
twentieth
light
cavalry
.
In
Burgundy
and
*NL*
in
the
southern
towns
they
planted
the
liberty
tree
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
*NL*
pole
surmounted
by
a
red
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
,
more
than
any
other
group
of
the
population
,
*NL*
as
we
stated
in
the
beginning
,
accentuated
this
situation
and
made
*NL*
it
felt
.
That
was
the
sore
point
.
This
old
faubourg
,
peopled
like
*NL*
an
ant-hill
,
laborious
,
courageous
,
and
angry
as
a
hive
of
bees
,
was
*NL*
quivering
with
expectation
and
with
the
desire
for
a
tumult
.
Everything
*NL*
was
in
a
state
of
agitation
there
,
without
any
interruption
,
however
,
of
*NL*
the
regular
work
.
It
is
impossible
to
convey
an
idea
of
this
lively
yet
*NL*
sombre
physiognomy
.
In
this
faubourg
exists
poignant
distress
hidden
*NL*
under
attic
roofs
;
there
also
exist
rare
and
ardent
minds
.
It
is
*NL*
particularly
in
the
matter
of
distress
and
intelligence
that
it
is
*NL*
dangerous
to
have
extremes
meet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
had
also
other
causes
to
tremble
;
for
it
*NL*
received
the
counter-shock
of
commercial
crises
,
of
failures
,
strikes
,
*NL*
slack
seasons
,
all
inherent
to
great
political
disturbances
.
In
times
*NL*
of
revolution
misery
is
both
cause
and
effect
.
The
blow
which
it
deals
*NL*
rebounds
upon
it
.
This
population
full
of
proud
virtue
,
capable
to
the
*NL*
highest
degree
of
latent
heat
,
always
ready
to
fly
to
arms
,
prompt
to
*NL*
explode
,
irritated
,
deep
,
undermined
,
seemed
to
be
only
awaiting
the
*NL*
fall
of
a
spark
.
Whenever
certain
sparks
float
on
the
horizon
chased
*NL*
by
the
wind
of
events
,
it
is
impossible
not
to
think
of
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Antoine
and
of
the
formidable
chance
which
has
placed
at
the
very
*NL*
gates
of
Paris
that
powder-house
of
suffering
and
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wine-shops
of
the
Faubourg
Antoine
,
which
have
been
more
than
*NL*
once
drawn
in
the
sketches
which
the
reader
has
just
perused
,
possess
*NL*
historical
notoriety
.
In
troublous
times
people
grow
intoxicated
there
*NL*
more
on
words
than
on
wine
.
A
sort
of
prophetic
spirit
and
an
afflatus
*NL*
of
the
future
circulates
there
,
swelling
hearts
and
enlarging
souls
.
The
*NL*
cabarets
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
resemble
those
taverns
of
Mont
*NL*
Aventine
erected
on
the
cave
of
the
Sibyl
and
communicating
with
*NL*
the
profound
and
sacred
breath
;
taverns
where
the
tables
were
almost
*NL*
tripods
,
and
where
was
drunk
what
Ennius
calls
the
sibylline
wine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
is
a
reservoir
of
people
.
Revolutionary
*NL*
agitations
create
fissures
there
,
through
which
trickles
the
popular
*NL*
sovereignty
.
This
sovereignty
may
do
evil
;
it
can
be
mistaken
like
any
*NL*
other
;
but
,
even
when
led
astray
,
it
remains
great
.
We
may
say
of
it
as
*NL*
of
the
blind
cyclops
,
Ingens
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
'
93
,
according
as
the
idea
which
was
floating
about
was
good
or
evil
,
*NL*
according
as
it
was
the
day
of
fanaticism
or
of
enthusiasm
,
there
leaped
*NL*
forth
from
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
now
savage
legions
,
now
heroic
*NL*
bands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Savage
.
Let
us
explain
this
word
.
When
these
bristling
men
,
who
in
the
*NL*
early
days
of
the
revolutionary
chaos
,
tattered
,
howling
,
wild
,
with
*NL*
uplifted
bludgeon
,
pike
on
high
,
hurled
themselves
upon
ancient
Paris
in
*NL*
an
uproar
,
what
did
they
want
?
They
wanted
an
end
to
oppression
,
an
*NL*
end
to
tyranny
,
an
end
to
the
sword
,
work
for
men
,
instruction
for
the
*NL*
child
,
social
sweetness
for
the
woman
,
liberty
,
equality
,
fraternity
,
*NL*
bread
for
all
,
the
idea
for
all
,
the
Edenizing
of
the
world
.
Progress
;
*NL*
and
that
holy
,
sweet
,
and
good
thing
,
progress
,
they
claimed
in
terrible
*NL*
wise
,
driven
to
extremities
as
they
were
,
half
naked
,
club
in
fist
,
*NL*
a
roar
in
their
mouths
.
They
were
savages
,
yes
;
but
the
savages
of
*NL*
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
proclaimed
right
furiously
;
they
were
desirous
,
if
only
with
*NL*
fear
and
trembling
,
to
force
the
human
race
to
paradise
.
They
seemed
*NL*
barbarians
,
and
they
were
saviours
.
They
demanded
light
with
the
mask
of
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Facing
these
men
,
who
were
ferocious
,
we
admit
,
and
terrifying
,
but
*NL*
ferocious
and
terrifying
for
good
ends
,
there
are
other
men
,
smiling
,
*NL*
embroidered
,
gilded
,
beribboned
,
starred
,
in
silk
stockings
,
in
white
*NL*
plumes
,
in
yellow
gloves
,
in
varnished
shoes
,
who
,
with
their
elbows
on
*NL*
a
velvet
table
,
beside
a
marble
chimney-piece
,
insist
gently
on
demeanor
*NL*
and
the
preservation
of
the
past
,
of
the
Middle
Ages
,
of
divine
right
,
*NL*
of
fanaticism
,
of
innocence
,
of
slavery
,
of
the
death
penalty
,
of
war
,
*NL*
glorifying
in
low
tones
and
with
politeness
,
the
sword
,
the
stake
,
and
*NL*
the
scaffold
.
For
our
part
,
if
we
were
forced
to
make
a
choice
between
*NL*
the
barbarians
of
civilization
and
the
civilized
men
of
barbarism
,
we
*NL*
should
choose
the
barbarians
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
thank
Heaven
,
still
another
choice
is
possible
.
No
perpendicular
*NL*
fall
is
necessary
,
in
front
any
more
than
in
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
despotism
nor
terrorism
.
We
desire
progress
with
a
gentle
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
takes
care
of
that
.
God
's
whole
policy
consists
in
rendering
slopes
*NL*
less
steep
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
ENJOLRAS
AND
HIS
LIEUTENANTS
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
this
epoch
that
Enjolras
,
in
view
of
a
possible
*NL*
catastrophe
,
instituted
a
kind
of
mysterious
census
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
present
at
a
secret
meeting
at
the
Cafe
Musain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
said
,
mixing
his
words
with
a
few
half-enigmatical
but
*NL*
significant
metaphors
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
proper
that
we
should
know
where
we
stand
and
on
whom
we
may
*NL*
count
.
If
combatants
are
required
,
they
must
be
provided
.
It
can
do
no
*NL*
harm
to
have
something
with
which
to
strike
.
Passers-by
always
have
more
*NL*
chance
of
being
gored
when
there
are
bulls
on
the
road
than
when
there
*NL*
are
none
.
Let
us
,
therefore
,
reckon
a
little
on
the
herd
.
How
many
of
us
*NL*
are
there
?
There
is
no
question
of
postponing
this
task
until
to-morrow
.
*NL*
Revolutionists
should
always
be
hurried
;
progress
has
no
time
to
lose
.
*NL*
Let
us
mistrust
the
unexpected
.
Let
us
not
be
caught
unprepared
.
We
must
*NL*
go
over
all
the
seams
that
we
have
made
and
see
whether
they
hold
fast
.
*NL*
This
business
ought
to
be
concluded
to-day
.
Courfeyrac
,
you
will
see
the
*NL*
polytechnic
students
.
It
is
their
day
to
go
out
.
To-day
is
Wednesday
.
*NL*
Feuilly
,
you
will
see
those
of
the
Glaciere
,
will
you
not
?
Combeferre
*NL*
has
promised
me
to
go
to
Picpus
.
There
is
a
perfect
swarm
and
an
*NL*
excellent
one
there
.
Bahorel
will
visit
the
Estrapade
.
Prouvaire
,
the
*NL*
masons
are
growing
lukewarm
;
you
will
bring
us
news
from
the
lodge
of
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Grenelle-Saint-Honore
.
Joly
will
go
to
Dupuytren
's
clinical
*NL*
lecture
,
and
feel
the
pulse
of
the
medical
school
.
Bossuet
will
take
a
*NL*
little
turn
in
the
court
and
talk
with
the
young
law
licentiates
.
I
will
*NL*
take
charge
of
the
Cougourde
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
arranges
everything
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
important
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
asked
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Barriere
du
Maine
,
''
replied
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
remained
for
a
moment
as
though
absorbed
in
reflection
,
then
he
*NL*
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Barriere
du
Maine
there
are
marble-workers
,
painters
,
and
*NL*
journeymen
in
the
studios
of
sculptors
.
They
are
an
enthusiastic
family
,
*NL*
but
liable
to
cool
off
.
I
do
n't
know
what
has
been
the
matter
with
*NL*
them
for
some
time
past
.
They
are
thinking
of
something
else
.
They
are
*NL*
becoming
extinguished
.
They
pass
their
time
playing
dominoes
.
There
is
*NL*
urgent
need
that
some
one
should
go
and
talk
with
them
a
little
,
but
*NL*
with
firmness
.
They
meet
at
Richefeu
's
.
They
are
to
be
found
there
*NL*
between
twelve
and
one
o'clock
.
Those
ashes
must
be
fanned
into
a
glow
.
*NL*
For
that
errand
I
had
counted
on
that
abstracted
Marius
,
who
is
a
good
*NL*
fellow
on
the
whole
,
but
he
no
longer
comes
to
us
.
I
need
some
one
for
*NL*
the
Barriere
du
Maine

I
have
no
one

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about

Grantaire

even

clock

*NL*
``
Be

Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
wild

replied
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
meditated
for
a
few
moments
,
and
made
the
gesture
of
a
man
who
*NL*
has
taken
a
resolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grantaire
,
''
he
said
gravely
,
``
I
consent
to
try
you
.
You
shall
go
to
the
*NL*
Barriere
du
Maine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
lived
in
furnished
lodgings
very
near
the
Cafe
Musain
.
He
went
*NL*
out
,
and
five
minutes
later
he
returned
.
He
had
gone
home
to
put
on
a
*NL*
Robespierre
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Red
,
''
said
he
as
he
entered
,
and
he
looked
intently
at
Enjolras
.
Then
,
*NL*
with
the
palm
of
his
energetic
hand
,
he
laid
the
two
scarlet
points
of
*NL*
the
waistcoat
across
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
stepping
up
to
Enjolras
,
he
whispered
in
his
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
easy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
jammed
his
hat
on
resolutely
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
the
back
room
of
the
Cafe
Musain
was
*NL*
deserted
.
All
the
friends
of
the
A
B
C
were
gone
,
each
in
his
own
*NL*
direction
,
each
to
his
own
task
.
Enjolras
,
who
had
reserved
the
*NL*
Cougourde
of
Aix
for
himself
,
was
the
last
to
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
members
of
the
Cougourde
of
Aix
who
were
in
Paris
then
met
on
the
*NL*
plain
of
Issy
,
in
one
of
the
abandoned
quarries
which
are
so
numerous
in
*NL*
that
side
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Enjolras
walked
towards
this
place
,
he
passed
the
whole
situation
*NL*
in
review
in
his
own
mind
.
The
gravity
of
events
was
self-evident
.
When
*NL*
facts
,
the
premonitory
symptoms
of
latent
social
malady
,
move
heavily
,
*NL*
the
slightest
complication
stops
and
entangles
them
.
A
phenomenon
whence
*NL*
arises
ruin
and
new
births
.
Enjolras
descried
a
luminous
uplifting
*NL*
beneath
the
gloomy
skirts
of
the
future
.
Who
knows
?
Perhaps
the
moment
*NL*
was
at
hand
.
The
people
were
again
taking
possession
of
right
,
and
*NL*
what
a
fine
spectacle
!
The
revolution
was
again
majestically
taking
*NL*
possession
of
France
and
saying
to
the
world
:
``
The
sequel
to-morrow
!
''
*NL*
Enjolras
was
content
.
The
furnace
was
being
heated
.
He
had
at
that
*NL*
moment
a
powder
train
of
friends
scattered
all
over
Paris
.
He
composed
,
*NL*
in
his
own
mind
,
with
Combeferre
's
philosophical
and
penetrating
*NL*
eloquence
,
Feuilly
's
cosmopolitan
enthusiasm
,
Courfeyrac
's
dash
,
*NL*
Bahorel
's
smile
,
Jean
Prouvaire
's
melancholy
,
Joly
's
science
,
Bossuet
's
*NL*
sarcasms
,
a
sort
of
electric
spark
which
took
fire
nearly
everywhere
at
*NL*
once
.
All
hands
to
work
.
Surely
,
the
result
would
answer
to
the
effort
.
*NL*
This
was
well
.
This
made
him
think
of
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
''
said
he
to
himself
,
``
the
Barriere
du
Maine
will
not
take
me
far
*NL*
out
of
my
way
.
What
if
I
were
to
go
on
as
far
as
Richefeu
's
?
Let
us
have
*NL*
a
look
at
what
Grantaire
is
about
,
and
see
how
he
is
getting
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
o'clock
was
striking
from
the
Vaugirard
steeple
when
Enjolras
*NL*
reached
the
Richefeu
smoking-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pushed
open
the
door
,
entered
,
folded
his
arms
,
letting
the
door
fall
*NL*
to
and
strike
his
shoulders
,
and
gazed
at
that
room
filled
with
tables
,
*NL*
men
,
and
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
broke
forth
from
the
mist
of
smoke
,
interrupted
by
another
*NL*
voice
.
It
was
Grantaire
holding
a
dialogue
with
an
adversary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
was
sitting
opposite
another
figure
,
at
a
marble
Saint-Anne
*NL*
table
,
strewn
with
grains
of
bran
and
dotted
with
dominos
.
He
was
*NL*
hammering
the
table
with
his
fist
,
and
this
is
what
Enjolras
heard
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Double-six

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
LARK
'S
MEADOW
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
witnessed
the
unexpected
termination
of
the
ambush
upon
whose
*NL*
track
he
had
set
Javert
;
but
Javert
had
no
sooner
quitted
the
building
,
*NL*
bearing
off
his
prisoners
in
three
hackney-coaches
,
than
Marius
also
*NL*
glided
out
of
the
house
.
It
was
only
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
Marius
*NL*
betook
himself
to
Courfeyrac
.
Courfeyrac
was
no
longer
the
imperturbable
*NL*
inhabitant
of
the
Latin
Quarter
,
he
had
gone
to
live
in
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Verrerie
``
for
political
reasons
''
;
this
quarter
was
one
where
,
at
that
*NL*
epoch
,
insurrection
liked
to
install
itself
.
Marius
said
to
Courfeyrac
:
*NL*
``
I
have
come
to
sleep
with
you
.
''
Courfeyrac
dragged
a
mattress
off
his
*NL*
bed
,
which
was
furnished
with
two
,
spread
it
out
on
the
floor
,
and
said
:
*NL*
``
There
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
seven
o'clock
on
the
following
morning
,
Marius
returned
to
the
hovel
,
*NL*
paid
the
quarter
's
rent
which
he
owed
to
Ma'am
Bougon
,
had
his
books
,
*NL*
his
bed
,
his
table
,
his
commode
,
and
his
two
chairs
loaded
on
a
*NL*
hand-cart
and
went
off
without
leaving
his
address
,
so
that
when
Javert
*NL*
returned
in
the
course
of
the
morning
,
for
the
purpose
of
questioning
*NL*
Marius
as
to
the
events
of
the
preceding
evening
,
he
found
only
Ma'am
*NL*
Bougon
,
who
answered
:
``
Moved
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ma'am
Bougon
was
convinced
that
Marius
was
to
some
extent
an
accomplice
*NL*
of
the
robbers
who
had
been
seized
the
night
before
.
``
Who
would
ever
*NL*
have
said
it
?
''
she
exclaimed
to
the
portresses
of
the
quarter
,
``
a
young
*NL*
man
like
that
,
who
had
the
air
of
a
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
two
reasons
for
this
prompt
change
of
residence
.
The
first
*NL*
was
,
that
he
now
had
a
horror
of
that
house
,
where
he
had
beheld
,
so
*NL*
close
at
hand
,
and
in
its
most
repulsive
and
most
ferocious
development
,
*NL*
a
social
deformity
which
is
,
perhaps
,
even
more
terrible
than
the
wicked
*NL*
rich
man
,
the
wicked
poor
man
.
The
second
was
,
that
he
did
not
wish
*NL*
to
figure
in
the
lawsuit
which
would
insue
in
all
probability
,
and
be
*NL*
brought
in
to
testify
against
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
thought
that
the
young
man
,
whose
name
he
had
forgotten
,
was
*NL*
afraid
,
and
had
fled
,
or
perhaps
,
had
not
even
returned
home
at
the
time
*NL*
of
the
ambush
;
he
made
some
efforts
to
find
him
,
however
,
but
without
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
passed
,
then
another
.
Marius
was
still
with
Courfeyrac
.
He
had
*NL*
learned
from
a
young
licentiate
in
law
,
an
habitual
frequenter
of
the
*NL*
courts
,
that
Thenardier
was
in
close
confinement
.
Every
Monday
,
*NL*
Marius
had
five
francs
handed
in
to
the
clerk
's
office
of
La
Force
for
*NL*
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Marius
had
no
longer
any
money
,
he
borrowed
the
five
francs
from
*NL*
Courfeyrac
.
It
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
had
ever
borrowed
*NL*
money
.
These
periodical
five
francs
were
a
double
riddle
to
Courfeyrac
*NL*
who
lent
and
to
Thenardier
who
received
them
.
``
To
whom
can
they
go
?
''
*NL*
thought
Courfeyrac
.
``
Whence
can
this
come
to
me
?
''
Thenardier
asked
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Marius
was
heart-broken
.
Everything
had
plunged
through
a
*NL*
trap-door
once
more
.
He
no
longer
saw
anything
before
him
;
his
life
*NL*
was
again
buried
in
mystery
where
he
wandered
fumblingly
.
He
had
for
a
*NL*
moment
beheld
very
close
at
hand
,
in
that
obscurity
,
the
young
girl
whom
*NL*
he
loved
,
the
old
man
who
seemed
to
be
her
father
,
those
unknown
beings
,
*NL*
who
were
his
only
interest
and
his
only
hope
in
this
world
;
and
,
at
the
*NL*
very
moment
when
he
thought
himself
on
the
point
of
grasping
them
,
a
*NL*
gust
had
swept
all
these
shadows
away
.
Not
a
spark
of
certainty
and
*NL*
truth
had
been
emitted
even
in
the
most
terrible
of
collisions
.
No
*NL*
conjecture
was
possible
.
He
no
longer
knew
even
the
name
that
he
thought
*NL*
he
knew
.
It
certainly
was
not
Ursule
.
And
the
Lark
was
a
nickname
.
And
*NL*
what
was
he
to
think
of
the
old
man
?
Was
he
actually
in
hiding
from
*NL*
the
police
?
The
white-haired
workman
whom
Marius
had
encountered
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
Invalides
recurred
to
his
mind
.
It
now
seemed
probable
*NL*
that
that
workingman
and
M.
Leblanc
were
one
and
the
same
person
.
So
he
*NL*
disguised
himself
?
That
man
had
his
heroic
and
his
equivocal
sides
.
Why
*NL*
had
he
not
called
for
help
?
Why
had
he
fled
?
Was
he
,
or
was
he
not
,
*NL*
the
father
of
the
young
girl
?
Was
he
,
in
short
,
the
man
whom
Thenardier
*NL*
thought
that
he
recognized
?
Thenardier
might
have
been
mistaken
.
These
*NL*
formed
so
many
insoluble
problems
.
All
this
,
it
is
true
,
detracted
*NL*
nothing
from
the
angelic
charms
of
the
young
girl
of
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
Heart-rending
distress
;
Marius
bore
a
passion
in
his
heart
,
and
night
*NL*
over
his
eyes
.
He
was
thrust
onward
,
he
was
drawn
,
and
he
could
not
*NL*
stir
.
All
had
vanished
,
save
love
.
Of
love
itself
he
had
lost
the
*NL*
instincts
and
the
sudden
illuminations
.
Ordinarily
,
this
flame
which
*NL*
burns
us
lights
us
also
a
little
,
and
casts
some
useful
gleams
without
.
*NL*
But
Marius
no
longer
even
heard
these
mute
counsels
of
passion
.
He
never
*NL*
said
to
himself
:
``
What
if
I
were
to
go
to
such
a
place
?
What
if
I
were
*NL*
to
try
such
and
such
a
thing
?
''
The
girl
whom
he
could
no
longer
call
*NL*
Ursule
was
evidently
somewhere
;
nothing
warned
Marius
in
what
direction
*NL*
he
should
seek
her
.
His
whole
life
was
now
summed
up
in
two
words
;
*NL*
absolute
uncertainty
within
an
impenetrable
fog
.
To
see
her
once
again
;
*NL*
he
still
aspired
to
this
,
but
he
no
longer
expected
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
crown
all
,
his
poverty
had
returned
.
He
felt
that
icy
breath
close
to
*NL*
him
,
on
his
heels
.
In
the
midst
of
his
torments
,
and
long
before
*NL*
this
,
he
had
discontinued
his
work
,
and
nothing
is
more
dangerous
than
*NL*
discontinued
work
;
it
is
a
habit
which
vanishes
.
A
habit
which
is
easy
*NL*
to
get
rid
of
,
and
difficult
to
take
up
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
certain
amount
of
dreaming
is
good
,
like
a
narcotic
in
discreet
doses
.
*NL*
It
lulls
to
sleep
the
fevers
of
the
mind
at
labor
,
which
are
sometimes
*NL*
severe
,
and
produces
in
the
spirit
a
soft
and
fresh
vapor
which
corrects
*NL*
the
over-harsh
contours
of
pure
thought
,
fills
in
gaps
here
and
there
,
*NL*
binds
together
and
rounds
off
the
angles
of
the
ideas
.
But
too
much
*NL*
dreaming
sinks
and
drowns
.
Woe
to
the
brain-worker
who
allows
himself
to
*NL*
fall
entirely
from
thought
into
revery
!
He
thinks
that
he
can
re-ascend
*NL*
with
equal
ease
,
and
he
tells
himself
that
,
after
all
,
it
is
the
same
*NL*
thing
.
Error
!
*NL*
*NL*
Thought
is
the
toil
of
the
intelligence
,
revery
its
voluptuousness
.
To
*NL*
replace
thought
with
revery
is
to
confound
a
poison
with
a
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
begun
in
that
way
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
.
Passion
had
*NL*
supervened
and
had
finished
the
work
of
precipitating
him
into
chimaeras
*NL*
without
object
or
bottom
.
One
no
longer
emerges
from
one
's
self
except
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
going
off
to
dream
.
Idle
production
.
Tumultuous
and
*NL*
stagnant
gulf
.
And
,
in
proportion
as
labor
diminishes
,
needs
increase
.
*NL*
This
is
a
law
.
Man
,
in
a
state
of
revery
,
is
generally
prodigal
and
*NL*
slack
;
the
unstrung
mind
can
not
hold
life
within
close
bounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
,
in
that
mode
of
life
,
good
mingled
with
evil
,
for
if
*NL*
enervation
is
baleful
,
generosity
is
good
and
healthful
.
But
the
poor
*NL*
man
who
is
generous
and
noble
,
and
who
does
not
work
,
is
lost
.
Resources
*NL*
are
exhausted
,
needs
crop
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fatal
declivity
down
which
the
most
honest
and
the
firmest
as
well
as
*NL*
the
most
feeble
and
most
vicious
are
drawn
,
and
which
ends
in
one
of
two
*NL*
holds
,
suicide
or
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
going
outdoors
to
think
,
the
day
comes
when
one
goes
out
to
*NL*
throw
one
's
self
in
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excess
of
revery
breeds
men
like
Escousse
and
Lebras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
descending
this
declivity
at
a
slow
pace
,
with
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
girl
whom
he
no
longer
saw
.
What
we
have
just
written
seems
*NL*
strange
,
and
yet
it
is
true
.
The
memory
of
an
absent
being
kindles
in
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
heart
;
the
more
it
has
disappeared
,
the
more
it
*NL*
beams
;
the
gloomy
and
despairing
soul
sees
this
light
on
its
horizon
;
*NL*
the
star
of
the
inner
night
.
She
--
that
was
Marius
'
whole
thought
.
He
*NL*
meditated
of
nothing
else
;
he
was
confusedly
conscious
that
his
old
coat
*NL*
was
becoming
an
impossible
coat
,
and
that
his
new
coat
was
growing
old
,
*NL*
that
his
shirts
were
wearing
out
,
that
his
hat
was
wearing
out
,
that
his
*NL*
boots
were
giving
out
,
and
he
said
to
himself
:
``
If
I
could
but
see
her
*NL*
once
again
before
I
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
sweet
idea
alone
was
left
to
him
,
that
she
had
loved
him
,
that
her
*NL*
glance
had
told
him
so
,
that
she
did
not
know
his
name
,
but
that
she
did
*NL*
know
his
soul
,
and
that
,
wherever
she
was
,
however
mysterious
the
place
,
*NL*
she
still
loved
him
perhaps
.
Who
knows
whether
she
were
not
thinking
of
*NL*
him
as
he
was
thinking
of
her
?
Sometimes
,
in
those
inexplicable
hours
*NL*
such
as
are
experienced
by
every
heart
that
loves
,
though
he
had
no
*NL*
reasons
for
anything
but
sadness
and
yet
felt
an
obscure
quiver
of
joy
,
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
:
``
It
is
her
thoughts
that
are
coming
to
me
!
''
Then
he
*NL*
added
:
``
Perhaps
my
thoughts
reach
her
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
illusion
,
at
which
he
shook
his
head
a
moment
later
,
was
*NL*
sufficient
,
nevertheless
,
to
throw
beams
,
which
at
times
resembled
hope
,
*NL*
into
his
soul
.
From
time
to
time
,
especially
at
that
evening
hour
which
*NL*
is
the
most
depressing
to
even
the
dreamy
,
he
allowed
the
purest
,
the
*NL*
most
impersonal
,
the
most
ideal
of
the
reveries
which
filled
his
brain
,
*NL*
to
fall
upon
a
notebook
which
contained
nothing
else
.
He
called
this
*NL*
``
writing
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
his
reason
was
deranged
.
Quite
the
*NL*
contrary
.
He
had
lost
the
faculty
of
working
and
of
moving
firmly
*NL*
towards
any
fixed
goal
,
but
he
was
endowed
with
more
clear-sightedness
*NL*
and
rectitude
than
ever
.
Marius
surveyed
by
a
calm
and
real
,
although
*NL*
peculiar
light
,
what
passed
before
his
eyes
,
even
the
most
indifferent
*NL*
deeds
and
men
;
he
pronounced
a
just
criticism
on
everything
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
honest
dejection
and
candid
disinterestedness
.
His
judgment
,
which
*NL*
was
almost
wholly
disassociated
from
hope
,
held
itself
aloof
and
soared
*NL*
on
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
nothing
escaped
him
,
nothing
deceived
him
,
and
*NL*
every
moment
he
was
discovering
the
foundation
of
life
,
of
humanity
,
and
*NL*
of
destiny
.
Happy
,
even
in
the
midst
of
anguish
,
is
he
to
whom
God
has
*NL*
given
a
soul
worthy
of
love
and
of
unhappiness
!
He
who
has
not
viewed
*NL*
the
things
of
this
world
and
the
heart
of
man
under
this
double
light
*NL*
has
seen
nothing
and
knows
nothing
of
the
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soul
which
loves
and
suffers
is
in
a
state
of
sublimity
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
day
followed
day
,
and
nothing
new
presented
itself
.
It
*NL*
merely
seemed
to
him
,
that
the
sombre
space
which
still
remained
to
be
*NL*
traversed
by
him
was
growing
shorter
with
every
instant
.
He
thought
that
*NL*
he
already
distinctly
perceived
the
brink
of
the
bottomless
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
he
repeated
to
himself
,
``
shall
I
not
see
her
again
before
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
you
have
ascended
the
Rue
Saint-Jacques
,
left
the
barrier
on
one
*NL*
side
and
followed
the
old
inner
boulevard
for
some
distance
,
you
reach
*NL*
the
Rue
de
la
Sante
,
then
the
Glaciere
,
and
,
a
little
while
before
*NL*
arriving
at
the
little
river
of
the
Gobelins
,
you
come
to
a
sort
of
*NL*
field
which
is
the
only
spot
in
the
long
and
monotonous
chain
of
the
*NL*
boulevards
of
Paris
,
where
Ruysdeel
would
be
tempted
to
sit
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
indescribable
there
which
exhales
grace
,
a
green
*NL*
meadow
traversed
by
tightly
stretched
lines
,
from
which
flutter
rags
*NL*
drying
in
the
wind
,
and
an
old
market-gardener
's
house
,
built
in
the
*NL*
time
of
Louis
XIII.
,
with
its
great
roof
oddly
pierced
with
dormer
*NL*
windows
,
dilapidated
palisades
,
a
little
water
amid
poplar-trees
,
*NL*
women
,
voices
,
laughter
;
on
the
horizon
the
Pantheon
,
the
pole
of
*NL*
the
Deaf-Mutes
,
the
Val-de-Grace
,
black
,
squat
,
fantastic
,
amusing
,
*NL*
magnificent
,
and
in
the
background
,
the
severe
square
crests
of
the
*NL*
towers
of
Notre
Dame
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
place
is
worth
looking
at
,
no
one
goes
thither
.
Hardly
one
cart
*NL*
or
wagoner
passes
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
Marius
'
solitary
strolls
led
him
to
this
plot
of
*NL*
ground
,
near
the
water
.
That
day
,
there
was
a
rarity
on
the
boulevard
,
*NL*
a
passer-by
.
Marius
,
vaguely
impressed
with
the
almost
savage
beauty
of
*NL*
the
place
,
asked
this
passer-by
:
--
``
What
is
the
name
of
this
spot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
person
replied
:
``
It
is
the
Lark
's
meadow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:
``
It
was
here
that
Ulbach
killed
the
shepherdess
of
Ivry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
the
word
``
Lark
''
Marius
heard
nothing
more
.
These
sudden
*NL*
congealments
in
the
state
of
revery
,
which
a
single
word
suffices
to
*NL*
evoke
,
do
occur
.
The
entire
thought
is
abruptly
condensed
around
an
*NL*
idea
,
and
it
is
no
longer
capable
of
perceiving
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Lark
was
the
appellation
which
had
replaced
Ursule
in
the
depths
of
*NL*
Marius
'
melancholy
.
--
``
Stop
,
''
said
he
with
a
sort
of
unreasoning
stupor
*NL*
peculiar
to
these
mysterious
asides
,
``
this
is
her
meadow
.
I
shall
know
*NL*
where
she
lives
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
absurd
,
but
irresistible
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
every
day
he
returned
to
that
meadow
of
the
Lark
.

CHAPTER
II
--
EMBRYONIC
FORMATION
OF
CRIMES
IN
THE
INCUBATION
OF
PRISONS
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
's
triumph
in
the
Gorbeau
hovel
seemed
complete
,
but
had
not
been
*NL*
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
and
this
constituted
the
principal
anxiety
,
Javert
*NL*
had
not
taken
the
prisoner
prisoner
.
The
assassinated
man
who
flees
*NL*
is
more
suspicious
than
the
assassin
,
and
it
is
probable
that
this
*NL*
personage
,
who
had
been
so
precious
a
capture
for
the
ruffians
,
would
be
*NL*
no
less
fine
a
prize
for
the
authorities
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
Montparnasse
had
escaped
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
opportunity
of
laying
hands
on
that
``
devil
's
dandy
''
must
be
*NL*
waited
for
.
Montparnasse
had
,
in
fact
,
encountered
Eponine
as
she
stood
*NL*
on
the
watch
under
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
,
and
had
led
her
off
,
*NL*
preferring
to
play
Nemorin
with
the
daughter
rather
than
Schinderhannes
*NL*
with
the
father
.
It
was
well
that
he
did
so
.
He
was
free
.
As
for
*NL*
Eponine
,
Javert
had
caused
her
to
be
seized
;
a
mediocre
consolation
.
*NL*
Eponine
had
joined
Azelma
at
Les
Madelonettes
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
finally
,
on
the
way
from
the
Gorbeau
house
to
La
Force
,
one
of
the
*NL*
principal
prisoners
,
Claquesous
,
had
been
lost
.
It
was
not
known
how
*NL*
this
had
been
effected
,
the
police
agents
and
the
sergeants
``
could
*NL*
not
understand
it
at
all
.
''
He
had
converted
himself
into
vapor
,
he
had
*NL*
slipped
through
the
handcuffs
,
he
had
trickled
through
the
crevices
of
*NL*
the
carriage
,
the
fiacre
was
cracked
,
and
he
had
fled
;
all
that
they
*NL*
were
able
to
say
was
,
that
on
arriving
at
the
prison
,
there
was
no
*NL*
Claquesous
.
Either
the
fairies
or
the
police
had
had
a
hand
in
it
.
Had
*NL*
Claquesous
melted
into
the
shadows
like
a
snow-flake
in
water
?
Had
there
*NL*
been
unavowed
connivance
of
the
police
agents
?
Did
this
man
belong
*NL*
to
the
double
enigma
of
order
and
disorder
?
Was
he
concentric
with
*NL*
infraction
and
repression
?
Had
this
sphinx
his
fore
paws
in
crime
and
*NL*
his
hind
paws
in
authority
?
Javert
did
not
accept
such
comminations
,
and
*NL*
would
have
bristled
up
against
such
compromises
;
but
his
squad
included
*NL*
other
inspectors
besides
himself
,
who
were
more
initiated
than
he
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
although
they
were
his
subordinates
in
the
secrets
of
the
*NL*
Prefecture
,
and
Claquesous
had
been
such
a
villain
that
he
might
make
*NL*
a
very
good
agent
.
It
is
an
excellent
thing
for
ruffianism
and
an
*NL*
admirable
thing
for
the
police
to
be
on
such
intimate
juggling
terms
*NL*
with
the
night
.
These
double-edged
rascals
do
exist
.
However
that
may
*NL*
be
,
Claquesous
had
gone
astray
and
was
not
found
again
.
Javert
appeared
*NL*
to
be
more
irritated
than
amazed
at
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Marius
,
``
that
booby
of
a
lawyer
,
''
who
had
probably
become
*NL*
frightened
,
and
whose
name
Javert
had
forgotten
,
Javert
attached
very
*NL*
little
importance
to
him
.
Moreover
,
a
lawyer
can
be
hunted
up
at
any
*NL*
time
.
But
was
he
a
lawyer
after
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
investigation
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
magistrate
had
thought
it
advisable
not
to
put
one
of
these
men
of
*NL*
the
band
of
Patron
Minette
in
close
confinement
,
in
the
hope
that
he
*NL*
would
chatter
.
This
man
was
Brujon
,
the
long-haired
man
of
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Petit-Banquier
.
He
had
been
let
loose
in
the
Charlemagne
courtyard
,
and
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
watchers
were
fixed
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
name
of
Brujon
is
one
of
the
souvenirs
of
La
Force
.
In
that
hideous
*NL*
courtyard
,
called
the
court
of
the
Batiment-Neuf
-LRB-
New
Building
-RRB-
,
which
*NL*
the
administration
called
the
court
Saint-Bernard
,
and
which
the
robbers
*NL*
called
the
Fosseaux-Lions
-LRB-
The
Lion
's
Ditch
-RRB-
,
on
that
wall
covered
with
*NL*
scales
and
leprosy
,
which
rose
on
the
left
to
a
level
with
the
roofs
,
*NL*
near
an
old
door
of
rusty
iron
which
led
to
the
ancient
chapel
of
the
*NL*
ducal
residence
of
La
Force
,
then
turned
in
a
dormitory
for
ruffians
,
*NL*
there
could
still
be
seen
,
twelve
years
ago
,
a
sort
of
fortress
roughly
*NL*
carved
in
the
stone
with
a
nail
,
and
beneath
it
this
signature
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
BRUJON
,
1811
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Brujon
of
1811
was
the
father
of
the
Brujon
of
1832
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
,
of
whom
the
reader
caught
but
a
glimpse
at
the
Gorbeau
*NL*
house
,
was
a
very
cunning
and
very
adroit
young
spark
,
with
a
bewildered
*NL*
and
plaintive
air
.
It
was
in
consequence
of
this
plaintive
air
that
the
*NL*
magistrate
had
released
him
,
thinking
him
more
useful
in
the
Charlemagne
*NL*
yard
than
in
close
confinement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Robbers
do
not
interrupt
their
profession
because
they
are
in
the
hands
*NL*
of
justice
.
They
do
not
let
themselves
be
put
out
by
such
a
trifle
as
*NL*
that
.
To
be
in
prison
for
one
crime
is
no
reason
for
not
beginning
on
*NL*
another
crime
.
They
are
artists
,
who
have
one
picture
in
the
salon
,
and
*NL*
who
toil
,
none
the
less
,
on
a
new
work
in
their
studios
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brujon
seemed
to
be
stupefied
by
prison
.
He
could
sometimes
be
seen
*NL*
standing
by
the
hour
together
in
front
of
the
sutler
's
window
in
the
*NL*
Charlemagne
yard
,
staring
like
an
idiot
at
the
sordid
list
of
prices
*NL*
which
began
with
:
garlic
,
62
centimes
,
and
ended
with
:
cigar
,
5
*NL*
centimes
.
Or
he
passed
his
time
in
trembling
,
chattering
his
teeth
,
*NL*
saying
that
he
had
a
fever
,
and
inquiring
whether
one
of
the
eight
and
*NL*
twenty
beds
in
the
fever
ward
was
vacant
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
towards
the
end
of
February
,
1832
,
it
was
discovered
that
*NL*
Brujon
,
that
somnolent
fellow
,
had
had
three
different
commissions
*NL*
executed
by
the
errand-men
of
the
establishment
,
not
under
his
own
name
,
*NL*
but
in
the
name
of
three
of
his
comrades
;
and
they
had
cost
him
in
all
*NL*
fifty
sous
,
an
exorbitant
outlay
which
attracted
the
attention
of
the
*NL*
prison
corporal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Inquiries
were
instituted
,
and
on
consulting
the
tariff
of
commissions
*NL*
posted
in
the
convict
's
parlor
,
it
was
learned
that
the
fifty
sous
could
*NL*
be
analyzed
as
follows
:
three
commissions
;
one
to
the
Pantheon
,
ten
*NL*
sous
;
one
to
Val-de-Grace
,
fifteen
sous
;
and
one
to
the
Barriere
de
*NL*
Grenelle
,
twenty-five
sous
.
This
last
was
the
dearest
of
the
whole
*NL*
tariff
.
Now
,
at
the
Pantheon
,
at
the
Val-de-Grace
,
and
at
the
Barriere
*NL*
de
Grenelle
were
situated
the
domiciles
of
the
three
very
redoubtable
*NL*
prowlers
of
the
barriers
,
Kruideniers
,
alias
Bizarre
,
Glorieux
,
an
*NL*
ex-convict
,
and
Barre-Carosse
,
upon
whom
the
attention
of
the
police
was
*NL*
directed
by
this
incident
.
It
was
thought
that
these
men
were
members
*NL*
of
Patron
Minette
;
two
of
those
leaders
,
Babet
and
Gueulemer
,
had
been
*NL*
captured
.
It
was
supposed
that
the
messages
,
which
had
been
addressed
,
*NL*
not
to
houses
,
but
to
people
who
were
waiting
for
them
in
the
street
,
*NL*
must
have
contained
information
with
regard
to
some
crime
that
had
been
*NL*
plotted
.
They
were
in
possession
of
other
indications
;
they
laid
hand
on
*NL*
the
three
prowlers
,
and
supposed
that
they
had
circumvented
some
one
or
*NL*
other
of
Brujon
's
machinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
a
week
after
these
measures
had
been
taken
,
one
night
,
as
the
*NL*
superintendent
of
the
watch
,
who
had
been
inspecting
the
lower
dormitory
*NL*
in
the
Batiment-Neuf
,
was
about
to
drop
his
chestnut
in
the
box
--
this
*NL*
was
the
means
adopted
to
make
sure
that
the
watchmen
performed
their
*NL*
duties
punctually
;
every
hour
a
chestnut
must
be
dropped
into
all
the
*NL*
boxes
nailed
to
the
doors
of
the
dormitories
--
a
watchman
looked
through
*NL*
the
peep-hole
of
the
dormitory
and
beheld
Brujon
sitting
on
his
bed
and
*NL*
writing
something
by
the
light
of
the
hall-lamp
.
The
guardian
entered
,
*NL*
Brujon
was
put
in
a
solitary
cell
for
a
month
,
but
they
were
not
able
to
*NL*
seize
what
he
had
written
.
The
police
learned
nothing
further
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
certain
is
,
that
on
the
following
morning
,
a
``
postilion
''
*NL*
was
flung
from
the
Charlemagne
yard
into
the
Lions
'
Ditch
,
over
the
*NL*
five-story
building
which
separated
the
two
court-yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
prisoners
call
a
``
postilion
''
is
a
pellet
of
bread
artistically
*NL*
moulded
,
which
is
sent
into
Ireland
,
that
is
to
say
,
over
the
roofs
of
a
*NL*
prison
,
from
one
courtyard
to
another
.
Etymology
:
over
England
;
from
one
*NL*
land
to
another
;
into
Ireland
.
This
little
pellet
falls
in
the
yard
.
The
*NL*
man
who
picks
it
up
opens
it
and
finds
in
it
a
note
addressed
to
some
*NL*
prisoner
in
that
yard
.
If
it
is
a
prisoner
who
finds
the
treasure
,
he
*NL*
forwards
the
note
to
its
destination
;
if
it
is
a
keeper
,
or
one
of
the
*NL*
prisoners
secretly
sold
who
are
called
sheep
in
prisons
and
foxes
in
the
*NL*
galleys
,
the
note
is
taken
to
the
office
and
handed
over
to
the
police
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
,
the
postilion
reached
its
address
,
although
the
person
*NL*
to
whom
it
was
addressed
was
,
at
that
moment
,
in
solitary
confinement
.
*NL*
This
person
was
no
other
than
Babet
,
one
of
the
four
heads
of
Patron
*NL*
Minette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
postilion
contained
a
roll
of
paper
on
which
only
these
two
lines
*NL*
were
written
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Babet
.
There
is
an
affair
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
A
gate
on
a
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
Brujon
had
written
the
night
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
male
and
female
searchers
,
Babet
managed
to
pass
the
note
on
*NL*
from
La
Force
to
the
Salpetriere
,
to
a
``
good
friend
''
whom
he
had
and
who
*NL*
was
shut
up
there
.
This
woman
in
turn
transmitted
the
note
to
another
*NL*
woman
of
her
acquaintance
,
a
certain
Magnon
,
who
was
strongly
suspected
*NL*
by
the
police
,
though
not
yet
arrested
.
This
Magnon
,
whose
name
the
*NL*
reader
has
already
seen
,
had
relations
with
the
Thenardier
,
which
will
*NL*
be
described
in
detail
later
on
,
and
she
could
,
by
going
to
see
Eponine
,
*NL*
serve
as
a
bridge
between
the
Salpetriere
and
Les
Madelonettes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
happened
,
that
at
precisely
that
moment
,
as
proofs
were
wanting
*NL*
in
the
investigation
directed
against
Thenardier
in
the
matter
of
his
*NL*
daughters
,
Eponine
and
Azelma
were
released
.
When
Eponine
came
out
,
*NL*
Magnon
,
who
was
watching
the
gate
of
the
Madelonettes
,
handed
her
*NL*
Brujon
's
note
to
Babet
,
charging
her
to
look
into
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
went
to
the
Rue
Plumet
,
recognized
the
gate
and
the
garden
,
*NL*
observed
the
house
,
spied
,
lurked
,
and
,
a
few
days
later
,
brought
to
*NL*
Magnon
,
who
delivers
in
the
Rue
Clocheperce
,
a
biscuit
,
which
Magnon
*NL*
transmitted
to
Babet
's
mistress
in
the
Salpetriere
.
A
biscuit
,
in
the
*NL*
shady
symbolism
of
prisons
,
signifies
:
Nothing
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
that
in
less
than
a
week
from
that
time
,
as
Brujon
and
Babet
met
in
*NL*
the
circle
of
La
Force
,
the
one
on
his
way
to
the
examination
,
the
other
*NL*
on
his
way
from
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
asked
Brujon
,
``
the
Rue
P.
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Biscuit
,
''
replied
Babet
.
Thus
did
the
foetus
of
crime
engendered
by
*NL*
Brujon
in
La
Force
miscarry
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
miscarriage
had
its
consequences
,
however
,
which
were
perfectly
*NL*
distinct
from
Brujon
's
programme
.
The
reader
will
see
what
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
when
we
think
we
are
knotting
one
thread
,
we
are
tying
quite
*NL*
another

CHAPTER
III
--
APPARITION
TO
FATHER
MABEUF
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
no
longer
went
to
see
any
one
,
but
he
sometimes
encountered
*NL*
Father
Mabeuf
by
chance
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Marius
was
slowly
descending
those
melancholy
steps
which
may
be
*NL*
called
the
cellar
stairs
,
and
which
lead
to
places
without
light
,
where
*NL*
the
happy
can
be
heard
walking
overhead
,
M.
Mabeuf
was
descending
on
his
*NL*
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Flora
of
Cauteretz
no
longer
sold
at
all
.
The
experiments
on
indigo
*NL*
had
not
been
successful
in
the
little
garden
of
Austerlitz
,
which
had
*NL*
a
bad
exposure
.
M.
Mabeuf
could
cultivate
there
only
a
few
plants
which
*NL*
love
shade
and
dampness
.
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
become
discouraged
.
He
*NL*
had
obtained
a
corner
in
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
,
with
a
good
exposure
,
*NL*
to
make
his
trials
with
indigo
``
at
his
own
expense
.
''
For
this
purpose
he
*NL*
had
pawned
his
copperplates
of
the
Flora
.
He
had
reduced
his
breakfast
*NL*
to
two
eggs
,
and
he
left
one
of
these
for
his
old
servant
,
to
whom
he
*NL*
had
paid
no
wages
for
the
last
fifteen
months
.
And
often
his
breakfast
*NL*
was
his
only
meal
.
He
no
longer
smiled
with
his
infantile
smile
,
he
had
*NL*
grown
morose
and
no
longer
received
visitors
.
Marius
did
well
not
to
*NL*
dream
of
going
thither
.
Sometimes
,
at
the
hour
when
M.
Mabeuf
was
on
his
*NL*
way
to
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
,
the
old
man
and
the
young
man
passed
*NL*
each
other
on
the
Boulevard
de
l'Hopital
.
They
did
not
speak
,
and
only
*NL*
exchanged
a
melancholy
sign
of
the
head
.
A
heart-breaking
thing
it
is
*NL*
that
there
comes
a
moment
when
misery
looses
bonds
!
Two
men
who
have
*NL*
been
friends
become
two
chance
passers-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Royal
the
bookseller
was
dead
.
M.
Mabeuf
no
longer
knew
his
books
,
*NL*
his
garden
,
or
his
indigo
:
these
were
the
three
forms
which
happiness
,
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
hope
had
assumed
for
him
.
This
sufficed
him
for
his
*NL*
living
.
He
said
to
himself
:
``
When
I
shall
have
made
my
balls
of
blueing
,
*NL*
I
shall
be
rich
,
I
will
withdraw
my
copperplates
from
the
pawn-shop
,
*NL*
I
will
put
my
Flora
in
vogue
again
with
trickery
,
plenty
of
money
and
*NL*
advertisements
in
the
newspapers
and
I
will
buy
,
I
know
well
where
,
a
*NL*
copy
of
Pierre
de
Medine
's
Art
de
Naviguer
,
with
wood-cuts
,
edition
of
*NL*
1655
.
''
In
the
meantime
,
he
toiled
all
day
over
his
plot
of
indigo
,
and
*NL*
at
night
he
returned
home
to
water
his
garden
,
and
to
read
his
books
.
At
*NL*
that
epoch
,
M.
Mabeuf
was
nearly
eighty
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
he
had
a
singular
apparition
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
returned
home
while
it
was
still
broad
daylight
.
Mother
*NL*
Plutarque
,
whose
health
was
declining
,
was
ill
and
in
bed
.
He
had
dined
*NL*
on
a
bone
,
on
which
a
little
meat
lingered
,
and
a
bit
of
bread
that
he
*NL*
had
found
on
the
kitchen
table
,
and
had
seated
himself
on
an
overturned
*NL*
stone
post
,
which
took
the
place
of
a
bench
in
his
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
this
bench
there
rose
,
after
the
fashion
in
orchard-gardens
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
large
chest
,
of
beams
and
planks
,
much
dilapidated
,
a
rabbit-hutch
on
*NL*
the
ground
floor
,
a
fruit-closet
on
the
first
.
There
was
nothing
in
the
*NL*
hutch
,
but
there
were
a
few
apples
in
the
fruit-closet
,
--
the
remains
of
*NL*
the
winter
's
provision
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
had
set
himself
to
turning
over
and
reading
,
with
the
aid
of
*NL*
his
glasses
,
two
books
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
and
in
which
,
*NL*
a
serious
thing
at
his
age
,
he
was
interested
.
His
natural
timidity
*NL*
rendered
him
accessible
to
the
acceptance
of
superstitions
in
a
certain
*NL*
degree
.
The
first
of
these
books
was
the
famous
treatise
of
President
*NL*
Delancre
,
De
l'inconstance
des
Demons
;
the
other
was
a
quarto
by
Mutor
*NL*
de
la
Rubaudiere
,
Sur
les
Diables
de
Vauvert
et
les
Gobelins
de
la
*NL*
Bievre
.
This
last-mentioned
old
volume
interested
him
all
the
more
,
*NL*
because
his
garden
had
been
one
of
the
spots
haunted
by
goblins
in
*NL*
former
times
.
The
twilight
had
begun
to
whiten
what
was
on
high
and
to
*NL*
blacken
all
below
.
As
he
read
,
over
the
top
of
the
book
which
he
held
*NL*
in
his
hand
,
Father
Mabeuf
was
surveying
his
plants
,
and
among
others
a
*NL*
magnificent
rhododendron
which
was
one
of
his
consolations
;
four
days
of
*NL*
heat
,
wind
,
and
sun
without
a
drop
of
rain
,
had
passed
;
the
stalks
were
*NL*
bending
,
the
buds
drooping
,
the
leaves
falling
;
all
this
needed
water
,
*NL*
the
rhododendron
was
particularly
sad
.
Father
Mabeuf
was
one
of
those
*NL*
persons
for
whom
plants
have
souls
.
The
old
man
had
toiled
all
day
over
*NL*
his
indigo
plot
,
he
was
worn
out
with
fatigue
,
but
he
rose
,
laid
*NL*
his
books
on
the
bench
,
and
walked
,
all
bent
over
and
with
tottering
*NL*
footsteps
,
to
the
well
,
but
when
he
had
grasped
the
chain
,
he
could
not
*NL*
even
draw
it
sufficiently
to
unhook
it
.
Then
he
turned
round
and
cast
a
*NL*
glance
of
anguish
toward
heaven
which
was
becoming
studded
with
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
had
that
serenity
which
overwhelms
the
troubles
of
man
*NL*
beneath
an
indescribably
mournful
and
eternal
joy
.
The
night
promised
to
*NL*
be
as
arid
as
the
day
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stars
everywhere
!
''
thought
the
old
man
;
``
not
the
tiniest
cloud
!
Not
a
*NL*
drop
of
water
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
his
head
,
which
had
been
upraised
for
a
moment
,
fell
back
upon
his
*NL*
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
it
again
,
and
once
more
looked
at
the
sky
,
murmuring
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
tear
of
dew
!
A
little
pity
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tried
again
to
unhook
the
chain
of
the
well
,
and
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
he
heard
a
voice
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
Mabeuf
,
would
you
like
to
have
me
water
your
garden
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
a
noise
as
of
a
wild
animal
passing
became
audible
*NL*
in
the
hedge
,
and
he
beheld
emerging
from
the
shrubbery
a
sort
of
tall
,
*NL*
slender
girl
,
who
drew
herself
up
in
front
of
him
and
stared
boldly
at
*NL*
him
.
She
had
less
the
air
of
a
human
being
than
of
a
form
which
had
just
*NL*
blossomed
forth
from
the
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Father
Mabeuf
,
who
was
easily
terrified
,
and
who
was
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
,
quick
to
take
alarm
,
was
able
to
reply
by
a
single
syllable
,
this
*NL*
being
,
whose
movements
had
a
sort
of
odd
abruptness
in
the
darkness
,
had
*NL*
unhooked
the
chain
,
plunged
in
and
withdrawn
the
bucket
,
and
filled
the
*NL*
watering-pot
,
and
the
goodman
beheld
this
apparition
,
which
had
bare
*NL*
feet
and
a
tattered
petticoat
,
running
about
among
the
flower-beds
*NL*
distributing
life
around
her
.
The
sound
of
the
watering-pot
on
the
*NL*
leaves
filled
Father
Mabeuf
's
soul
with
ecstasy
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
*NL*
the
rhododendron
was
happy
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
bucketful
emptied
,
the
girl
drew
a
second
,
then
a
third
.
She
*NL*
watered
the
whole
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
about
her
,
as
she
thus
ran
about
among
paths
,
where
*NL*
her
outline
appeared
perfectly
black
,
waving
her
angular
arms
,
and
with
*NL*
her
fichu
all
in
rags
,
that
resembled
a
bat
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
finished
,
Father
Mabeuf
approached
her
with
tears
in
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
laid
his
hand
on
her
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
will
bless
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
are
an
angel
since
you
take
care
of
*NL*
the
flowers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
replied
.
``
I
am
the
devil
,
but
that
's
all
the
same
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
exclaimed
,
without
either
waiting
for
or
hearing
her
*NL*
response
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
that
I
am
so
unhappy
and
so
poor
,
and
that
I
can
do
nothing
*NL*
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
something
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
where
M.
Marius
lives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
did
not
understand
.
``
What
Monsieur
Marius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
glassy
eyes
and
seemed
to
be
seeking
something
that
had
*NL*
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
man
who
used
to
come
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
M.
Mabeuf
had
searched
his
memory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
--
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
I
know
what
you
mean
.
Wait
!
Monsieur
*NL*
Marius
--
the
Baron
Marius
Pontmercy
,
parbleu
!
He
lives
,
--
or
rather
,
he
no
*NL*
longer
lives
,
--
ah
well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
he
had
bent
over
to
train
a
branch
of
rhododendron
,
and
he
*NL*
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
,
I
know
now
.
He
very
often
passes
along
the
boulevard
,
and
goes
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
Glaciere
,
Rue
Croulebarbe
.
The
meadow
of
the
Lark
.
*NL*
Go
there
.
It
is
not
hard
to
meet
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
M.
Mabeuf
straightened
himself
up
,
there
was
no
longer
any
one
*NL*
there
;
the
girl
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
decidedly
terrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
''
he
thought
,
``
if
my
garden
had
not
been
watered
,
I
should
think
*NL*
that
she
was
a
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
later
,
when
he
was
in
bed
,
it
came
back
to
him
,
and
as
he
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
at
that
confused
moment
when
thought
,
like
that
fabulous
bird
*NL*
which
changes
itself
into
a
fish
in
order
to
cross
the
sea
,
little
by
*NL*
little
assumes
the
form
of
a
dream
in
order
to
traverse
slumber
,
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
in
a
bewildered
way
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
sooth
,
that
greatly
resembles
what
Rubaudiere
narrates
of
the
*NL*
goblins
.
Could
it
have
been
a
goblin
?

CHAPTER
IV
--
AN
APPARITION
TO
MARIUS
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
after
this
visit
of
a
``
spirit
''
to
Farmer
Mabeuf
,
one
*NL*
morning
,
--
it
was
on
a
Monday
,
the
day
when
Marius
borrowed
the
*NL*
hundred-sou
piece
from
Courfeyrac
for
Thenardier
--
Marius
had
put
this
*NL*
coin
in
his
pocket
,
and
before
carrying
it
to
the
clerk
's
office
,
he
*NL*
had
gone
``
to
take
a
little
stroll
,
''
in
the
hope
that
this
would
make
him
*NL*
work
on
his
return
.
It
was
always
thus
,
however
.
As
soon
as
he
rose
,
he
*NL*
seated
himself
before
a
book
and
a
sheet
of
paper
in
order
to
scribble
*NL*
some
translation
;
his
task
at
that
epoch
consisted
in
turning
into
*NL*
French
a
celebrated
quarrel
between
Germans
,
the
Gans
and
Savigny
*NL*
controversy
;
he
took
Savigny
,
he
took
Gans
,
read
four
lines
,
tried
to
*NL*
write
one
,
could
not
,
saw
a
star
between
him
and
his
paper
,
and
rose
*NL*
from
his
chair
,
saying
:
``
I
shall
go
out
.
That
will
put
me
in
spirits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
off
he
went
to
the
Lark
's
meadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
beheld
more
than
ever
the
star
,
and
less
than
ever
Savigny
and
*NL*
Gans
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
returned
home
,
tried
to
take
up
his
work
again
,
and
did
not
succeed
;
*NL*
there
was
no
means
of
re-knotting
a
single
one
of
the
threads
which
*NL*
were
broken
in
his
brain
;
then
he
said
to
himself
:
``
I
will
not
go
out
*NL*
to-morrow
.
It
prevents
my
working
.
''
And
he
went
out
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lived
in
the
Lark
's
meadow
more
than
in
Courfeyrac
's
lodgings
.
That
*NL*
was
his
real
address
:
Boulevard
de
la
Sante
,
at
the
seventh
tree
from
*NL*
the
Rue
Croulebarbe
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
morning
he
had
quitted
the
seventh
tree
and
had
seated
himself
on
*NL*
the
parapet
of
the
River
des
Gobelins
.
A
cheerful
sunlight
penetrated
*NL*
the
freshly
unfolded
and
luminous
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dreaming
of
``
Her
.
''
And
his
meditation
turning
to
a
reproach
,
fell
*NL*
back
upon
himself
;
he
reflected
dolefully
on
his
idleness
,
his
paralysis
*NL*
of
soul
,
which
was
gaining
on
him
,
and
of
that
night
which
was
growing
*NL*
more
dense
every
moment
before
him
,
to
such
a
point
that
he
no
longer
*NL*
even
saw
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
athwart
this
painful
extrication
of
indistinct
ideas
which
*NL*
was
not
even
a
monologue
,
so
feeble
had
action
become
in
him
,
and
he
*NL*
had
no
longer
the
force
to
care
to
despair
,
athwart
this
melancholy
*NL*
absorption
,
sensations
from
without
did
reach
him
.
He
heard
behind
him
,
*NL*
beneath
him
,
on
both
banks
of
the
river
,
the
laundresses
of
the
Gobelins
*NL*
beating
their
linen
,
and
above
his
head
,
the
birds
chattering
and
*NL*
singing
in
the
elm-trees
.
On
the
one
hand
,
the
sound
of
liberty
,
the
*NL*
careless
happiness
of
the
leisure
which
has
wings
;
on
the
other
,
the
*NL*
sound
of
toil
.
What
caused
him
to
meditate
deeply
,
and
almost
reflect
,
*NL*
were
two
cheerful
sounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
in
the
midst
of
his
dejected
ecstasy
,
he
heard
a
familiar
*NL*
voice
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
Here
he
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
eyes
,
and
recognized
that
wretched
child
who
had
come
to
*NL*
him
one
morning
,
the
elder
of
the
Thenardier
daughters
,
Eponine
;
he
knew
*NL*
her
name
now
.
Strange
to
say
,
she
had
grown
poorer
and
prettier
,
*NL*
two
steps
which
it
had
not
seemed
within
her
power
to
take
.
She
had
*NL*
accomplished
a
double
progress
,
towards
the
light
and
towards
distress
.
*NL*
She
was
barefooted
and
in
rags
,
as
on
the
day
when
she
had
so
resolutely
*NL*
entered
his
chamber
,
only
her
rags
were
two
months
older
now
,
the
holes
*NL*
were
larger
,
the
tatters
more
sordid
.
It
was
the
same
harsh
voice
,
*NL*
the
same
brow
dimmed
and
wrinkled
with
tan
,
the
same
free
,
wild
,
and
*NL*
vacillating
glance
.
She
had
besides
,
more
than
formerly
,
in
her
face
*NL*
that
indescribably
terrified
and
lamentable
something
which
sojourn
in
a
*NL*
prison
adds
to
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
bits
of
straw
and
hay
in
her
hair
,
not
like
Ophelia
through
*NL*
having
gone
mad
from
the
contagion
of
Hamlet
's
madness
,
but
because
she
*NL*
had
slept
in
the
loft
of
some
stable
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
spite
of
it
all
,
she
was
beautiful
.
What
a
star
art
thou
,
O
*NL*
youth
!
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
she
had
halted
in
front
of
Marius
with
a
trace
of
joy
*NL*
in
her
livid
countenance
,
and
something
which
resembled
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
for
several
moments
as
though
incapable
of
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
met
you
at
last
!
''
she
said
at
length
.
``
Father
Mabeuf
was
*NL*
right
,
it
was
on
this
boulevard
!
How
I
have
hunted
for
you
!
If
you
only
*NL*
knew
!
Do
you
know
?
I
have
been
in
the
jug
.
A
fortnight
!
They
let
me
out
!
*NL*
seeing
that
there
was
nothing
against
me
,
and
that
,
moreover
,
I
had
not
*NL*
reached
years
of
discretion
.
I
lack
two
months
of
it
.
Oh
!
how
I
have
*NL*
hunted
for
you
!
These
six
weeks
!
So
you
do
n't
live
down
there
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
understand
.
Because
of
that
affair
.
Those
take-downs
are
*NL*
disagreeable
.
You
cleared
out
.
Come
now
!
Why
do
you
wear
old
hats
like
*NL*
this
!
A
young
man
like
you
ought
to
have
fine
clothes
.
Do
you
know
,
*NL*
Monsieur
Marius
,
Father
Mabeuf
calls
you
Baron
Marius
,
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
.
It
is
n't
true
that
you
are
a
baron
?
Barons
are
old
fellows
,
they
*NL*
go
to
the
Luxembourg
,
in
front
of
the
chateau
,
where
there
is
the
most
*NL*
sun
,
and
they
read
the
Quotidienne
for
a
sou
.
I
once
carried
a
letter
to
*NL*
a
baron
of
that
sort
.
He
was
over
a
hundred
years
old
.
Say
,
where
do
you
*NL*
live
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
went
on
,
``
you
have
a
hole
in
your
shirt
.
I
must
sew
it
up
for
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
resumed
with
an
expression
which
gradually
clouded
over
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
seem
glad
to
see
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
held
his
peace
;
she
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
*NL*
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
I
choose
,
nevertheless
,
I
could
force
you
to
look
glad
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
demanded
Marius
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
used
to
call
me
thou
,
''
she
retorted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
what
dost
thou
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
bit
her
lips
;
she
seemed
to
hesitate
,
as
though
a
prey
to
some
sort
*NL*
of
inward
conflict
.
At
last
she
appeared
to
come
to
a
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
worse
,
I
do
n't
care
.
You
have
a
melancholy
air
,
I
want
you
*NL*
to
be
pleased
.
Only
promise
me
that
you
will
smile
.
I
want
to
see
you
*NL*
smile
and
hear
you
say
:
`
Ah
,
well
,
that
's
good
.
'
Poor
Mr.
Marius
!
you
*NL*
know
?
You
promised
me
that
you
would
give
me
anything
I
like
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
Only
speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
Marius
full
in
the
eye
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
the
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
turned
pale
.
All
the
blood
flowed
back
to
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
address
that
you
asked
me
to
get
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
added
,
as
though
with
an
effort
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
address
--
you
know
very
well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
stammered
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
that
young
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
uttered
,
she
sighed
deeply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
sprang
from
the
parapet
on
which
he
had
been
sitting
and
seized
*NL*
her
hand
distractedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Well
!
lead
me
thither
!
Tell
me
!
Ask
of
me
anything
you
wish
!
Where
*NL*
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with
me
,
''
she
responded
.
``
I
do
n't
know
the
street
or
number
very
*NL*
well
;
it
is
in
quite
the
other
direction
from
here
,
but
I
know
the
house
*NL*
well
,
I
will
take
you
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
withdrew
her
hand
and
went
on
,
in
a
tone
which
could
have
rent
*NL*
the
heart
of
an
observer
,
but
which
did
not
even
graze
Marius
in
his
*NL*
intoxicated
and
ecstatic
state
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
how
glad
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
cloud
swept
across
Marius
'
brow
.
He
seized
Eponine
by
the
arm
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swear
one
thing
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Swear
!
''
said
she
,
``
what
does
that
mean
?
Come
!
You
want
me
to
swear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
!
promise
me
,
Eponine
!
Swear
to
me
that
you
will
not
give
*NL*
this
address
to
your
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
to
him
with
a
stupefied
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eponine
!
How
do
you
know
that
my
name
is
Eponine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
what
I
tell
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
seem
to
hear
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nice
!
You
have
called
me
Eponine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
grasped
both
her
arms
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
answer
me
,
in
the
name
of
Heaven
!
pay
attention
to
what
I
am
saying
*NL*
to
you

to
me
that

not
tell
your
father
this
address

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father

''
said
she
.
``
Ah
yes
,
my
father

Be
at
ease

He
's
in
close

confinement

Besides
,
what
do
I
care
for
my
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
not
promise
me
!
''
exclaimed
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
go
of
me
!
''
she
said
,
bursting
into
a
laugh
,
``
how
you
do
shake
me
!
*NL*
Yes
!
Yes
!
I
promise
that

I
swear
that
to

What
is
that
to
me

I
*NL*
will
not

the

Is
that
right

Is
that
it
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
to
any

said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
to
any

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

''
resumed
Marius
,
``
take
me
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Immediately

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along

Ah

how
pleased
he
is
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
steps
she
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
following
me
too
closely
,
Monsieur
Marius
.
Let
me
go
on
ahead
,
*NL*
and
follow
me
so
,
without
seeming
to
do
it
.
A
nice
young
man
like
you
*NL*
must
not
be
seen
with
a
woman
like
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
tongue
can
express
all
that
lay
in
that
word
,
woman
,
thus
pronounced
*NL*
by
that
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
proceeded
a
dozen
paces
and
then
halted
once
more
;
Marius
joined
*NL*
her
.
She
addressed
him
sideways
,
and
without
turning
towards
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
you
know
that
you
promised
me
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
fumbled
in
his
pocket
.
All
that
he
owned
in
the
world
was
the
*NL*
five
francs
intended
for
Thenardier
the
father
.
He
took
them
and
laid
*NL*
them
in
Eponine
's
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
her
fingers
and
let
the
coin
fall
to
the
ground
,
and
gazed
at
*NL*
him
with
a
gloomy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*

money

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
HOUSE
WITH
A
SECRET
*NL*
*NL*
About
the
middle
of
the
last
century
,
a
chief
justice
in
the
Parliament
*NL*
of
Paris
having
a
mistress
and
concealing
the
fact
,
for
at
that
period
*NL*
the
grand
seignors
displayed
their
mistresses
,
and
the
bourgeois
*NL*
concealed
them
,
had
``
a
little
house
''
built
in
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Germain
,
in
the
deserted
Rue
Blomet
,
which
is
now
called
Rue
*NL*
Plumet
,
not
far
from
the
spot
which
was
then
designated
as
Combat
des
*NL*
Animaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
house
was
composed
of
a
single-storied
pavilion
;
two
rooms
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
,
two
chambers
on
the
first
floor
,
a
kitchen
down
stairs
,
*NL*
a
boudoir
up
stairs
,
an
attic
under
the
roof
,
the
whole
preceded
by
a
*NL*
garden
with
a
large
gate
opening
on
the
street
.
This
garden
was
about
*NL*
an
acre
and
a
half
in
extent
.
This
was
all
that
could
be
seen
by
*NL*
passers-by
;
but
behind
the
pavilion
there
was
a
narrow
courtyard
,
and
*NL*
at
the
end
of
the
courtyard
a
low
building
consisting
of
two
rooms
and
*NL*
a
cellar
,
a
sort
of
preparation
destined
to
conceal
a
child
and
nurse
*NL*
in
case
of
need
.
This
building
communicated
in
the
rear
by
a
masked
*NL*
door
which
opened
by
a
secret
spring
,
with
a
long
,
narrow
,
paved
winding
*NL*
corridor
,
open
to
the
sky
,
hemmed
in
with
two
lofty
walls
,
which
,
hidden
*NL*
with
wonderful
art
,
and
lost
as
it
were
between
garden
enclosures
and
*NL*
cultivated
land
,
all
of
whose
angles
and
detours
it
followed
,
ended
in
*NL*
another
door
,
also
with
a
secret
lock
which
opened
a
quarter
of
a
league
*NL*
away
,
almost
in
another
quarter
,
at
the
solitary
extremity
of
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Babylone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
this
the
chief
justice
entered
,
so
that
even
those
who
were
*NL*
spying
on
him
and
following
him
would
merely
have
observed
that
the
*NL*
justice
betook
himself
every
day
in
a
mysterious
way
somewhere
,
and
*NL*
would
never
have
suspected
that
to
go
to
the
Rue
de
Babylone
was
to
go
*NL*
to
the
Rue
Blomet
.
Thanks
to
clever
purchasers
of
land
,
the
magistrate
*NL*
had
been
able
to
make
a
secret
,
sewer-like
passage
on
his
own
property
,
*NL*
and
consequently
,
without
interference
.
Later
on
,
he
had
sold
in
little
*NL*
parcels
,
for
gardens
and
market
gardens
,
the
lots
of
ground
adjoining
*NL*
the
corridor
,
and
the
proprietors
of
these
lots
on
both
sides
thought
*NL*
they
had
a
party
wall
before
their
eyes
,
and
did
not
even
suspect
the
*NL*
long
,
paved
ribbon
winding
between
two
walls
amid
their
flower-beds
and
*NL*
their
orchards
.
Only
the
birds
beheld
this
curiosity
.
It
is
probable
*NL*
that
the
linnets
and
tomtits
of
the
last
century
gossiped
a
great
deal
*NL*
about
the
chief
justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pavilion
,
built
of
stone
in
the
taste
of
Mansard
,
wainscoted
and
*NL*
furnished
in
the
Watteau
style
,
rocaille
on
the
inside
,
old-fashioned
*NL*
on
the
outside
,
walled
in
with
a
triple
hedge
of
flowers
,
had
something
*NL*
discreet
,
coquettish
,
and
solemn
about
it
,
as
befits
a
caprice
of
love
*NL*
and
magistracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
house
and
corridor
,
which
have
now
disappeared
,
were
in
existence
*NL*
fifteen
years
ago
.
In
'93
a
coppersmith
had
purchased
the
house
with
*NL*
the
idea
of
demolishing
it
,
but
had
not
been
able
to
pay
the
price
;
the
*NL*
nation
made
him
bankrupt
.
So
that
it
was
the
house
which
demolished
the
*NL*
coppersmith
.
After
that
,
the
house
remained
uninhabited
,
and
fell
slowly
*NL*
to
ruin
,
as
does
every
dwelling
to
which
the
presence
of
man
does
not
*NL*
communicate
life
.
It
had
remained
fitted
with
its
old
furniture
,
was
*NL*
always
for
sale
or
to
let
,
and
the
ten
or
a
dozen
people
who
passed
*NL*
through
the
Rue
Plumet
were
warned
of
the
fact
by
a
yellow
and
illegible
*NL*
bit
of
writing
which
had
hung
on
the
garden
wall
since
1819
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
the
Restoration
,
these
same
passers-by
might
have
*NL*
noticed
that
the
bill
had
disappeared
,
and
even
that
the
shutters
on
the
*NL*
first
floor
were
open
.
The
house
was
occupied
,
in
fact
.
The
windows
had
*NL*
short
curtains
,
a
sign
that
there
was
a
woman
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
month
of
October
,
1829
,
a
man
of
a
certain
age
had
presented
*NL*
himself
and
had
hired
the
house
just
as
it
stood
,
including
,
of
course
,
*NL*
the
back
building
and
the
lane
which
ended
in
the
Rue
de
Babylone
.
He
*NL*
had
had
the
secret
openings
of
the
two
doors
to
this
passage
repaired
.
*NL*
The
house
,
as
we
have
just
mentioned
,
was
still
very
nearly
furnished
*NL*
with
the
justice
's
old
fitting
;
the
new
tenant
had
ordered
some
*NL*
repairs
,
had
added
what
was
lacking
here
and
there
,
had
replaced
the
*NL*
paving-stones
in
the
yard
,
bricks
in
the
floors
,
steps
in
the
stairs
,
*NL*
missing
bits
in
the
inlaid
floors
and
the
glass
in
the
lattice
windows
,
*NL*
and
had
finally
installed
himself
there
with
a
young
girl
and
an
elderly
*NL*
maid-servant
,
without
commotion
,
rather
like
a
person
who
is
slipping
*NL*
in
than
like
a
man
who
is
entering
his
own
house
.
The
neighbors
did
not
*NL*
gossip
about
him
,
for
the
reason
that
there
were
no
neighbors
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
unobtrusive
tenant
was
Jean
Valjean
,
the
young
girl
was
Cosette
.
*NL*
The
servant
was
a
woman
named
Toussaint
,
whom
Jean
Valjean
had
saved
*NL*
from
the
hospital
and
from
wretchedness
,
and
who
was
elderly
,
a
*NL*
stammerer
,
and
from
the
provinces
,
three
qualities
which
had
decided
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
to
take
her
with
him
.
He
had
hired
the
house
under
the
name
*NL*
of
M.
Fauchelevent
,
independent
gentleman
.
In
all
that
has
been
*NL*
related
heretofore
,
the
reader
has
,
doubtless
,
been
no
less
prompt
than
*NL*
Thenardier
to
recognize
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
had
Jean
Valjean
quitted
the
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus
?
What
had
*NL*
happened
?
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
had
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
that
Jean
Valjean
was
happy
in
the
convent
,
so
*NL*
happy
that
his
conscience
finally
took
the
alarm
.
He
saw
Cosette
every
*NL*
day
,
he
felt
paternity
spring
up
and
develop
within
him
more
and
more
,
*NL*
he
brooded
over
the
soul
of
that
child
,
he
said
to
himself
that
she
*NL*
was
his
,
that
nothing
could
take
her
from
him
,
that
this
would
last
*NL*
indefinitely
,
that
she
would
certainly
become
a
nun
,
being
thereto
*NL*
gently
incited
every
day
,
that
thus
the
convent
was
henceforth
the
*NL*
universe
for
her
as
it
was
for
him
,
that
he
should
grow
old
there
,
and
*NL*
that
she
would
grow
up
there
,
that
she
would
grow
old
there
,
and
that
*NL*
he
should
die
there
;
that
,
in
short
,
delightful
hope
,
no
separation
*NL*
was
possible
.
On
reflecting
upon
this
,
he
fell
into
perplexity
.
He
*NL*
interrogated
himself
.
He
asked
himself
if
all
that
happiness
were
*NL*
really
his
,
if
it
were
not
composed
of
the
happiness
of
another
,
of
*NL*
the
happiness
of
that
child
which
he
,
an
old
man
,
was
confiscating
and
*NL*
stealing
;
if
that
were
not
theft
?
He
said
to
himself
,
that
this
child
*NL*
had
a
right
to
know
life
before
renouncing
it
,
that
to
deprive
her
in
*NL*
advance
,
and
in
some
sort
without
consulting
her
,
of
all
joys
,
under
*NL*
the
pretext
of
saving
her
from
all
trials
,
to
take
advantage
of
her
*NL*
ignorance
of
her
isolation
,
in
order
to
make
an
artificial
vocation
*NL*
germinate
in
her
,
was
to
rob
a
human
creature
of
its
nature
and
to
lie
*NL*
to
God
.
And
who
knows
if
,
when
she
came
to
be
aware
of
all
this
some
*NL*
day
,
and
found
herself
a
nun
to
her
sorrow
,
Cosette
would
not
come
to
*NL*
hate
him
?
A
last
,
almost
selfish
thought
,
and
less
heroic
than
the
rest
,
*NL*
but
which
was
intolerable
to
him
.
He
resolved
to
quit
the
convent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resolved
on
this
;
he
recognized
with
anguish
,
the
fact
that
it
was
*NL*
necessary
.
As
for
objections
,
there
were
none
.
Five
years
'
sojourn
*NL*
between
these
four
walls
and
of
disappearance
had
necessarily
destroyed
*NL*
or
dispersed
the
elements
of
fear
.
He
could
return
tranquilly
among
men
.
*NL*
He
had
grown
old
,
and
all
had
undergone
a
change
.
Who
would
recognize
*NL*
him
now
?
And
then
,
to
face
the
worst
,
there
was
danger
only
for
himself
,
*NL*
and
he
had
no
right
to
condemn
Cosette
to
the
cloister
for
the
reason
*NL*
that
he
had
been
condemned
to
the
galleys
.
Besides
,
what
is
danger
in
*NL*
comparison
with
the
right
?
Finally
,
nothing
prevented
his
being
prudent
*NL*
and
taking
his
precautions
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Cosette
's
education
,
it
was
almost
finished
and
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
determination
once
taken
,
he
awaited
an
opportunity
.
It
was
not
long
*NL*
in
presenting
itself
.
Old
Fauchelevent
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
demanded
an
audience
with
the
revered
prioress
and
told
her
*NL*
that
,
having
come
into
a
little
inheritance
at
the
death
of
his
brother
,
*NL*
which
permitted
him
henceforth
to
live
without
working
,
he
should
leave
*NL*
the
service
of
the
convent
and
take
his
daughter
with
him
;
but
that
,
as
*NL*
it
was
not
just
that
Cosette
,
since
she
had
not
taken
the
vows
,
should
*NL*
have
received
her
education
gratuitously
,
he
humbly
begged
the
Reverend
*NL*
Prioress
to
see
fit
that
he
should
offer
to
the
community
,
as
indemnity
,
*NL*
for
the
five
years
which
Cosette
had
spent
there
,
the
sum
of
five
*NL*
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
that
Jean
Valjean
quitted
the
convent
of
the
Perpetual
*NL*
Adoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
leaving
the
convent
,
he
took
in
his
own
arms
the
little
valise
the
*NL*
key
to
which
he
still
wore
on
his
person
,
and
would
permit
no
porter
to
*NL*
touch
it
.
This
puzzled
Cosette
,
because
of
the
odor
of
embalming
which
*NL*
proceeded
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
state
at
once
,
that
this
trunk
never
quitted
him
more
.
He
always
*NL*
had
it
in
his
chamber
.
It
was
the
first
and
only
thing
sometimes
,
that
*NL*
he
carried
off
in
his
moving
when
he
moved
about
.
Cosette
laughed
at
it
,
*NL*
and
called
this
valise
his
inseparable
,
saying
:
``
I
am
jealous
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Jean
Valjean
did
not
reappear
in
the
open
air
without
*NL*
profound
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
discovered
the
house
in
the
Rue
Plumet
,
and
hid
himself
from
*NL*
sight
there
.
Henceforth
he
was
in
the
possession
of
the
name
:
--
Ultime
*NL*
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
he
hired
two
other
apartments
in
Paris
,
in
order
that
*NL*
he
might
attract
less
attention
than
if
he
were
to
remain
always
in
the
*NL*
same
quarter
,
and
so
that
he
could
,
at
need
,
take
himself
off
at
the
*NL*
slightest
disquietude
which
should
assail
him
,
and
in
short
,
so
that
*NL*
he
might
not
again
be
caught
unprovided
as
on
the
night
when
he
had
*NL*
so
miraculously
escaped
from
Javert
.
These
two
apartments
were
very
*NL*
pitiable
,
poor
in
appearance
,
and
in
two
quarters
which
were
far
remote
*NL*
from
each
other
,
the
one
in
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
the
other
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
from
time
to
time
,
now
to
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
now
to
the
*NL*
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
to
pass
a
month
or
six
weeks
,
without
taking
Toussaint
.
*NL*
He
had
himself
served
by
the
porters
,
and
gave
himself
out
as
a
*NL*
gentleman
from
the
suburbs
,
living
on
his
funds
,
and
having
a
little
*NL*
temporary
resting-place
in
town
.
This
lofty
virtue
had
three
domiciles
*NL*
in
Paris
for
the
sake
of
escaping
from
the
police
.

CHAPTER
II
--
JEAN
VALJEAN
AS
A
NATIONAL
GUARD
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
properly
speaking
,
he
lived
in
the
Rue
Plumet
,
and
he
had
*NL*
arranged
his
existence
there
in
the
following
fashion
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
the
servant
occupied
the
pavilion
;
she
had
the
big
*NL*
sleeping-room
with
the
painted
pier-glasses
,
the
boudoir
with
the
gilded
*NL*
fillets
,
the
justice
's
drawing-room
furnished
with
tapestries
and
vast
*NL*
arm-chairs
;
she
had
the
garden
.
Jean
Valjean
had
a
canopied
bed
of
*NL*
antique
damask
in
three
colors
and
a
beautiful
Persian
rug
purchased
in
*NL*
the
Rue
du
Figuier-Saint-Paul
at
Mother
Gaucher
's
,
put
into
Cosette
's
*NL*
chamber
,
and
,
in
order
to
redeem
the
severity
of
these
magnificent
*NL*
old
things
,
he
had
amalgamated
with
this
bric-a-brac
all
the
gay
and
*NL*
graceful
little
pieces
of
furniture
suitable
to
young
girls
,
an
etagere
,
*NL*
a
bookcase
filled
with
gilt-edged
books
,
an
inkstand
,
a
blotting-book
,
*NL*
paper
,
a
work-table
incrusted
with
mother
of
pearl
,
a
silver-gilt
*NL*
dressing-case
,
a
toilet
service
in
Japanese
porcelain
.
Long
damask
*NL*
curtains
with
a
red
foundation
and
three
colors
,
like
those
on
the
*NL*
bed
,
hung
at
the
windows
of
the
first
floor
.
On
the
ground
floor
,
the
*NL*
curtains
were
of
tapestry
.
All
winter
long
,
Cosette
's
little
house
was
*NL*
heated
from
top
to
bottom
.
Jean
Valjean
inhabited
the
sort
of
porter
's
*NL*
lodge
which
was
situated
at
the
end
of
the
back
courtyard
,
with
a
*NL*
mattress
on
a
folding-bed
,
a
white
wood
table
,
two
straw
chairs
,
an
*NL*
earthenware
water-jug
,
a
few
old
volumes
on
a
shelf
,
his
beloved
valise
*NL*
in
one
corner
,
and
never
any
fire
.
He
dined
with
Cosette
,
and
he
had
a
*NL*
loaf
of
black
bread
on
the
table
for
his
own
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Toussaint
came
,
he
had
said
to
her
:
``
It
is
the
young
lady
who
is
*NL*
the
mistress
of
this
house
.
''
--
``
And
you
,
monsieur
?
''
Toussaint
replied
in
*NL*
amazement
.
--
``
I
am
a
much
better
thing
than
the
master
,
I
am
the
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
been
taught
housekeeping
in
the
convent
,
and
she
regulated
*NL*
their
expenditure
,
which
was
very
modest
.
Every
day
,
Jean
Valjean
put
*NL*
his
arm
through
Cosette
's
and
took
her
for
a
walk
.
He
led
her
to
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
,
to
the
least
frequented
walk
,
and
every
Sunday
he
took
her
*NL*
to
mass
at
Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas
,
because
that
was
a
long
way
off
.
*NL*
As
it
was
a
very
poor
quarter
,
he
bestowed
alms
largely
there
,
and
the
*NL*
poor
people
surrounded
him
in
church
,
which
had
drawn
down
upon
him
*NL*
Thenardier
's
epistle
:
``
To
the
benevolent
gentleman
of
the
church
of
*NL*
Saint-Jacques-du-Haut-Pas
.
''
He
was
fond
of
taking
Cosette
to
visit
the
*NL*
poor
and
the
sick
.
No
stranger
ever
entered
the
house
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
*NL*
Toussaint
brought
their
provisions
,
and
Jean
Valjean
went
himself
for
*NL*
water
to
a
fountain
near
by
on
the
boulevard
.
Their
wood
and
wine
were
*NL*
put
into
a
half-subterranean
hollow
lined
with
rock-work
which
lay
near
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Babylone
and
which
had
formerly
served
the
chief-justice
as
*NL*
a
grotto
;
for
at
the
epoch
of
follies
and
``
Little
Houses
''
no
love
was
*NL*
without
a
grotto
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
door
opening
on
the
Rue
de
Babylone
,
there
was
a
box
destined
for
*NL*
the
reception
of
letters
and
papers
;
only
,
as
the
three
inhabitants
of
*NL*
the
pavilion
in
the
Rue
Plumet
received
neither
papers
nor
letters
,
the
*NL*
entire
usefulness
of
that
box
,
formerly
the
go-between
of
a
love
*NL*
affair
,
and
the
confidant
of
a
love-lorn
lawyer
,
was
now
limited
to
*NL*
the
tax-collector
's
notices
,
and
the
summons
of
the
guard
.
For
M.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
,
independent
gentleman
,
belonged
to
the
national
guard
;
*NL*
he
had
not
been
able
to
escape
through
the
fine
meshes
of
the
census
of
*NL*
1831
.
The
municipal
information
collected
at
that
time
had
even
reached
*NL*
the
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus
,
a
sort
of
impenetrable
and
holy
cloud
,
*NL*
whence
Jean
Valjean
had
emerged
in
venerable
guise
,
and
,
consequently
,
*NL*
worthy
of
mounting
guard
in
the
eyes
of
the
townhall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
or
four
times
a
year
,
Jean
Valjean
donned
his
uniform
and
mounted
*NL*
guard
;
he
did
this
willingly
,
however
;
it
was
a
correct
disguise
which
*NL*
mixed
him
with
every
one
,
and
yet
left
him
solitary
.
Jean
Valjean
had
*NL*
just
attained
his
sixtieth
birthday
,
the
age
of
legal
exemption
;
but
he
*NL*
did
not
appear
to
be
over
fifty
;
moreover
,
he
had
no
desire
to
escape
*NL*
his
sergeant-major
nor
to
quibble
with
Comte
de
Lobau
;
he
possessed
*NL*
no
civil
status
,
he
was
concealing
his
name
,
he
was
concealing
his
*NL*
identity
,
so
he
concealed
his
age
,
he
concealed
everything
;
and
,
as
we
*NL*
have
just
said
,
he
willingly
did
his
duty
as
a
national
guard
;
the
sum
*NL*
of
his
ambition
lay
in
resembling
any
other
man
who
paid
his
taxes
.
This
*NL*
man
had
for
his
ideal
,
within
,
the
angel
,
without
,
the
bourgeois
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
note
one
detail
,
however
;
when
Jean
Valjean
went
out
with
*NL*
Cosette
,
he
dressed
as
the
reader
has
already
seen
,
and
had
the
air
of
*NL*
a
retired
officer
.
When
he
went
out
alone
,
which
was
generally
at
night
,
*NL*
he
was
always
dressed
in
a
workingman
's
trousers
and
blouse
,
and
wore
*NL*
a
cap
which
concealed
his
face
.
Was
this
precaution
or
humility
?
Both
.
*NL*
Cosette
was
accustomed
to
the
enigmatical
side
of
her
destiny
,
and
*NL*
hardly
noticed
her
father
's
peculiarities
.
As
for
Toussaint
,
she
*NL*
venerated
Jean
Valjean
,
and
thought
everything
he
did
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
her
butcher
,
who
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
Jean
Valjean
,
said
to
*NL*
her
:
``
That
's
a
queer
fish
.
''
She
replied
:
``
He
's
a
saint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
Jean
Valjean
nor
Cosette
nor
Toussaint
ever
entered
or
emerged
*NL*
except
by
the
door
on
the
Rue
de
Babylone
.
Unless
seen
through
the
*NL*
garden
gate
it
would
have
been
difficult
to
guess
that
they
lived
in
*NL*
the
Rue
Plumet
.
That
gate
was
always
closed
.
Jean
Valjean
had
left
the
*NL*
garden
uncultivated
,
in
order
not
to
attract
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
,
possibly
,
he
made
a
mistake
.

CHAPTER

FOLIIS
AC
FRONDIBUS
*NL*
*NL*
The
garden
thus
left
to
itself
for
more
than
half
a
century
had
become
*NL*
extraordinary
and
charming
.
The
passers-by
of
forty
years
ago
halted
to
*NL*
gaze
at
it
,
without
a
suspicion
of
the
secrets
which
it
hid
in
its
fresh
*NL*
and
verdant
depths
.
More
than
one
dreamer
of
that
epoch
often
allowed
*NL*
his
thoughts
and
his
eyes
to
penetrate
indiscreetly
between
the
bars
of
*NL*
that
ancient
,
padlocked
gate
,
twisted
,
tottering
,
fastened
to
two
*NL*
green
and
moss-covered
pillars
,
and
oddly
crowned
with
a
pediment
of
*NL*
undecipherable
arabesque
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
stone
bench
in
one
corner
,
one
or
two
mouldy
statues
,
*NL*
several
lattices
which
had
lost
their
nails
with
time
,
were
rotting
on
*NL*
the
wall
,
and
there
were
no
walks
nor
turf
;
but
there
was
enough
grass
*NL*
everywhere
.
Gardening
had
taken
its
departure
,
and
nature
had
returned
.
*NL*
Weeds
abounded
,
which
was
a
great
piece
of
luck
for
a
poor
corner
of
*NL*
land
.
The
festival
of
gilliflowers
was
something
splendid
.
Nothing
*NL*
in
this
garden
obstructed
the
sacred
effort
of
things
towards
life
;
*NL*
venerable
growth
reigned
there
among
them
.
The
trees
had
bent
over
*NL*
towards
the
nettles
,
the
plant
had
sprung
upward
,
the
branch
had
*NL*
inclined
,
that
which
crawls
on
the
earth
had
gone
in
search
of
that
*NL*
which
expands
in
the
air
,
that
which
floats
on
the
wind
had
bent
over
*NL*
towards
that
which
trails
in
the
moss
;
trunks
,
boughs
,
leaves
,
fibres
,
*NL*
clusters
,
tendrils
,
shoots
,
spines
,
thorns
,
had
mingled
,
crossed
,
*NL*
married
,
confounded
themselves
in
each
other
;
vegetation
in
a
deep
*NL*
and
close
embrace
,
had
celebrated
and
accomplished
there
,
under
the
*NL*
well-pleased
eye
of
the
Creator
,
in
that
enclosure
three
hundred
feet
*NL*
square
,
the
holy
mystery
of
fraternity
,
symbol
of
the
human
fraternity
.
*NL*
This
garden
was
no
longer
a
garden
,
it
was
a
colossal
thicket
,
that
is
*NL*
to
say
,
something
as
impenetrable
as
a
forest
,
as
peopled
as
a
city
,
*NL*
quivering
like
a
nest
,
sombre
like
a
cathedral
,
fragrant
like
a
bouquet
,
*NL*
solitary
as
a
tomb
,
living
as
a
throng
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Floreal
-LSB-
34
-RSB-
this
enormous
thicket
,
free
behind
its
gate
and
within
*NL*
its
four
walls
,
entered
upon
the
secret
labor
of
germination
,
quivered
*NL*
in
the
rising
sun
,
almost
like
an
animal
which
drinks
in
the
breaths
of
*NL*
cosmic
love
,
and
which
feels
the
sap
of
April
rising
and
boiling
in
*NL*
its
veins
,
and
shakes
to
the
wind
its
enormous
wonderful
green
locks
,
*NL*
sprinkled
on
the
damp
earth
,
on
the
defaced
statues
,
on
the
crumbling
*NL*
steps
of
the
pavilion
,
and
even
on
the
pavement
of
the
deserted
street
,
*NL*
flowers
like
stars
,
dew
like
pearls
,
fecundity
,
beauty
,
life
,
joy
,
*NL*
perfumes
.
At
midday
,
a
thousand
white
butterflies
took
refuge
there
,
and
*NL*
it
was
a
divine
spectacle
to
see
that
living
summer
snow
whirling
about
*NL*
there
in
flakes
amid
the
shade
.
There
,
in
those
gay
shadows
of
verdure
,
*NL*
a
throng
of
innocent
voices
spoke
sweetly
to
the
soul
,
and
what
the
*NL*
twittering
forgot
to
say
the
humming
completed
.
In
the
evening
,
a
dreamy
*NL*
vapor
exhaled
from
the
garden
and
enveloped
it
;
a
shroud
of
mist
,
a
*NL*
calm
and
celestial
sadness
covered
it
;
the
intoxicating
perfume
of
the
*NL*
honeysuckles
and
convolvulus
poured
out
from
every
part
of
it
,
like
an
*NL*
exquisite
and
subtle
poison
;
the
last
appeals
of
the
woodpeckers
and
*NL*
the
wagtails
were
audible
as
they
dozed
among
the
branches
;
one
felt
the
*NL*
sacred
intimacy
of
the
birds
and
the
trees
;
by
day
the
wings
rejoice
the
*NL*
leaves
,
by
night
the
leaves
protect
the
wings
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
winter
the
thicket
was
black
,
dripping
,
bristling
,
shivering
,
and
*NL*
allowed
some
glimpse
of
the
house
.
Instead
of
flowers
on
the
branches
*NL*
and
dew
in
the
flowers
,
the
long
silvery
tracks
of
the
snails
were
*NL*
visible
on
the
cold
,
thick
carpet
of
yellow
leaves
;
but
in
any
fashion
,
*NL*
under
any
aspect
,
at
all
seasons
,
spring
,
winter
,
summer
,
autumn
,
this
*NL*
tiny
enclosure
breathed
forth
melancholy
,
contemplation
,
solitude
,
*NL*
liberty
,
the
absence
of
man
,
the
presence
of
God
;
and
the
rusty
old
gate
*NL*
had
the
air
of
saying
:
``
This
garden
belongs
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
of
no
avail
that
the
pavements
of
Paris
were
there
on
every
side
,
*NL*
the
classic
and
splendid
hotels
of
the
Rue
de
Varennes
a
couple
of
paces
*NL*
away
,
the
dome
of
the
Invalides
close
at
hand
,
the
Chamber
of
Deputies
*NL*
not
far
off
;
the
carriages
of
the
Rue
de
Bourgogne
and
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Dominique
rumbled
luxuriously
,
in
vain
,
in
the
vicinity
,
in
vain
*NL*
did
the
yellow
,
brown
,
white
,
and
red
omnibuses
cross
each
other
's
*NL*
course
at
the
neighboring
cross-roads
;
the
Rue
Plumet
was
the
desert
;
*NL*
and
the
death
of
the
former
proprietors
,
the
revolution
which
had
passed
*NL*
over
it
,
the
crumbling
away
of
ancient
fortunes
,
absence
,
forgetfulness
,
*NL*
forty
years
of
abandonment
and
widowhood
,
had
sufficed
to
restore
to
*NL*
this
privileged
spot
ferns
,
mulleins
,
hemlock
,
yarrow
,
tall
weeds
,
great
*NL*
crimped
plants
,
with
large
leaves
of
pale
green
cloth
,
lizards
,
beetles
,
*NL*
uneasy
and
rapid
insects
;
to
cause
to
spring
forth
from
the
depths
*NL*
of
the
earth
and
to
reappear
between
those
four
walls
a
certain
*NL*
indescribable
and
savage
grandeur
;
and
for
nature
,
which
disconcerts
*NL*
the
petty
arrangements
of
man
,
and
which
sheds
herself
always
thoroughly
*NL*
where
she
diffuses
herself
at
all
,
in
the
ant
as
well
as
in
the
eagle
,
*NL*
to
blossom
out
in
a
petty
little
Parisian
garden
with
as
much
rude
force
*NL*
and
majesty
as
in
a
virgin
forest
of
the
New
World
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
small
,
in
fact
;
any
one
who
is
subject
to
the
profound
*NL*
and
penetrating
influence
of
nature
knows
this
.
Although
no
absolute
*NL*
satisfaction
is
given
to
philosophy
,
either
to
circumscribe
the
cause
*NL*
or
to
limit
the
effect
,
the
contemplator
falls
into
those
unfathomable
*NL*
ecstasies
caused
by
these
decompositions
of
force
terminating
in
unity
.
*NL*
Everything
toils
at
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Algebra
is
applied
to
the
clouds
;
the
radiation
of
the
star
profits
*NL*
the
rose
;
no
thinker
would
venture
to
affirm
that
the
perfume
of
the
*NL*
hawthorn
is
useless
to
the
constellations
.
Who
,
then
,
can
calculate
the
*NL*
course
of
a
molecule
?
How
do
we
know
that
the
creation
of
worlds
is
not
*NL*
determined
by
the
fall
of
grains
of
sand
?
Who
knows
the
reciprocal
*NL*
ebb
and
flow
of
the
infinitely
great
and
the
infinitely
little
,
the
*NL*
reverberations
of
causes
in
the
precipices
of
being
,
and
the
avalanches
*NL*
of
creation
?
The
tiniest
worm
is
of
importance
;
the
great
is
little
,
the
*NL*
little
is
great
;
everything
is
balanced
in
necessity
;
alarming
vision
*NL*
for
the
mind
.
There
are
marvellous
relations
between
beings
and
things
;
*NL*
in
that
inexhaustible
whole
,
from
the
sun
to
the
grub
,
nothing
despises
*NL*
the
other
;
all
have
need
of
each
other
.
The
light
does
not
bear
away
*NL*
terrestrial
perfumes
into
the
azure
depths
,
without
knowing
what
it
is
*NL*
doing
;
the
night
distributes
stellar
essences
to
the
sleeping
flowers
.
*NL*
All
birds
that
fly
have
round
their
leg
the
thread
of
the
infinite
.
*NL*
Germination
is
complicated
with
the
bursting
forth
of
a
meteor
and
with
*NL*
the
peck
of
a
swallow
cracking
its
egg
,
and
it
places
on
one
level
the
*NL*
birth
of
an
earthworm
and
the
advent
of
Socrates
.
Where
the
telescope
*NL*
ends
,
the
microscope
begins
.
Which
of
the
two
possesses
the
larger
field
*NL*
of
vision
?
Choose
.
A
bit
of
mould
is
a
pleiad
of
flowers
;
a
nebula
is
an
*NL*
ant-hill
of
stars
.
The
same
promiscuousness
,
and
yet
more
unprecedented
,
*NL*
exists
between
the
things
of
the
intelligence
and
the
facts
of
*NL*
substance
.
Elements
and
principles
mingle
,
combine
,
wed
,
multiply
with
*NL*
each
other
,
to
such
a
point
that
the
material
and
the
moral
world
are
*NL*
brought
eventually
to
the
same
clearness
.
The
phenomenon
is
perpetually
*NL*
returning
upon
itself
.
In
the
vast
cosmic
exchanges
the
universal
life
*NL*
goes
and
comes
in
unknown
quantities
,
rolling
entirely
in
the
invisible
*NL*
mystery
of
effluvia
,
employing
everything
,
not
losing
a
single
dream
,
*NL*
not
a
single
slumber
,
sowing
an
animalcule
here
,
crumbling
to
bits
a
*NL*
planet
there
,
oscillating
and
winding
,
making
of
light
a
force
and
of
*NL*
thought
an
element
,
disseminated
and
invisible
,
dissolving
all

*NL*
except
that
geometrical
point
,
the
I

bringing
everything
back
to
the
*NL*
soul-atom
;
expanding
everything
in
God
,
entangling
all
activity
,
from
*NL*
summit

base
,
in
the
obscurity
of
a
dizzy
mechanism
,
attaching
the
*NL*
flight
of
an
insect
to
the
movement
of
the
earth
,
subordinating
,
who

knows

Were
it
only
by
the
identity

the
law

the
evolution

the

comet
in

the
whirling

in
the

Enormous

CHAPTER
IV
--
CHANGE
OF
GATE
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
that
this
garden
,
created
in
olden
days
to
conceal
wanton
*NL*
mysteries
,
had
been
transformed
and
become
fitted
to
shelter
chaste
*NL*
mysteries
.
There
were
no
longer
either
arbors
,
or
bowling
greens
,
or
*NL*
tunnels
,
or
grottos
;
there
was
a
magnificent
,
dishevelled
obscurity
*NL*
falling
like
a
veil
over
all
.
Paphos
had
been
made
over
into
Eden
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
to
say
what
element
of
repentance
had
rendered
this
retreat
*NL*
wholesome
.
This
flower-girl
now
offered
her
blossom
to
the
soul
.
This
*NL*
coquettish
garden
,
formerly
decidedly
compromised
,
had
returned
to
*NL*
virginity
and
modesty
.
A
justice
assisted
by
a
gardener
,
a
goodman
who
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
a
continuation
of
Lamoignon
,
and
another
goodman
who
*NL*
thought
that
he
was
a
continuation
of
Lenotre
,
had
turned
it
about
,
cut
,
*NL*
ruffled
,
decked
,
moulded
it
to
gallantry
;
nature
had
taken
possession
of
*NL*
it
once
more
,
had
filled
it
with
shade
,
and
had
arranged
it
for
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
also
,
in
this
solitude
,
a
heart
which
was
quite
ready
.
Love
*NL*
had
only
to
show
himself
;
he
had
here
a
temple
composed
of
verdure
,
*NL*
grass
,
moss
,
the
sight
of
birds
,
tender
shadows
,
agitated
branches
,
and
*NL*
a
soul
made
of
sweetness
,
of
faith
,
of
candor
,
of
hope
,
of
aspiration
,
*NL*
and
of
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
left
the
convent
when
she
was
still
almost
a
child
;
she
was
*NL*
a
little
more
than
fourteen
,
and
she
was
at
the
``
ungrateful
age
''
;
we
*NL*
have
already
said
,
that
with
the
exception
of
her
eyes
,
she
was
homely
*NL*
rather
than
pretty
;
she
had
no
ungraceful
feature
,
but
she
was
awkward
,
*NL*
thin
,
timid
and
bold
at
once
,
a
grown-up
little
girl
,
in
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
education
was
finished
,
that
is
to
say
,
she
has
been
taught
*NL*
religion
,
and
even
and
above
all
,
devotion
;
then
``
history
,
''
that
is
to
*NL*
say
the
thing
that
bears
that
name
in
convents
,
geography
,
grammar
,
*NL*
the
participles
,
the
kings
of
France
,
a
little
music
,
a
little
drawing
,
*NL*
etc.
;
but
in
all
other
respects
she
was
utterly
ignorant
,
which
is
a
*NL*
great
charm
and
a
great
peril
.
The
soul
of
a
young
girl
should
not
be
*NL*
left
in
the
dark
;
later
on
,
mirages
that
are
too
abrupt
and
too
lively
*NL*
are
formed
there
,
as
in
a
dark
chamber
.
She
should
be
gently
and
*NL*
discreetly
enlightened
,
rather
with
the
reflection
of
realities
than
*NL*
with
their
harsh
and
direct
light
.
A
useful
and
graciously
austere
*NL*
half-light
which
dissipates
puerile
fears
and
obviates
falls
.
There
is
*NL*
nothing
but
the
maternal
instinct
,
that
admirable
intuition
composed
of
*NL*
the
memories
of
the
virgin
and
the
experience
of
the
woman
,
which
knows
*NL*
how
this
half-light
is
to
be
created
and
of
what
it
should
consist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
supplies
the
place
of
this
instinct
.
All
the
nuns
in
the
world
*NL*
are
not
worth
as
much
as
one
mother
in
the
formation
of
a
young
girl
's
*NL*
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
had
no
mother
.
She
had
only
had
many
mothers
,
in
the
plural
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jean
Valjean
,
he
was
,
indeed
,
all
tenderness
,
all
solicitude
;
but
*NL*
he
was
only
an
old
man
and
he
knew
nothing
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
this
work
of
education
,
in
this
grave
matter
of
preparing
a
*NL*
woman
for
life
,
what
science
is
required
to
combat
that
vast
ignorance
*NL*
which
is
called
innocence
!
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
prepares
a
young
girl
for
passions
like
the
convent
.
The
convent
*NL*
turns
the
thoughts
in
the
direction
of
the
unknown
.
The
heart
,
thus
*NL*
thrown
back
upon
itself
,
works
downward
within
itself
,
since
it
can
not
*NL*
overflow
,
and
grows
deep
,
since
it
can
not
expand
.
Hence
visions
,
*NL*
suppositions
,
conjectures
,
outlines
of
romances
,
a
desire
for
*NL*
adventures
,
fantastic
constructions
,
edifices
built
wholly
in
the
inner
*NL*
obscurity
of
the
mind
,
sombre
and
secret
abodes
where
the
passions
*NL*
immediately
find
a
lodgement
as
soon
as
the
open
gate
permits
them
to
*NL*
enter
.
The
convent
is
a
compression
which
,
in
order
to
triumph
over
the
*NL*
human
heart
,
should
last
during
the
whole
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
quitting
the
convent
,
Cosette
could
have
found
nothing
more
sweet
and
*NL*
more
dangerous
than
the
house
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
It
was
the
continuation
*NL*
of
solitude
with
the
beginning
of
liberty
;
a
garden
that
was
closed
,
but
*NL*
a
nature
that
was
acrid
,
rich
,
voluptuous
,
and
fragrant
;
the
same
dreams
*NL*
as
in
the
convent
,
but
with
glimpses
of
young
men
;
a
grating
,
but
one
*NL*
that
opened
on
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
when
she
arrived
there
,
we
repeat
,
she
was
only
a
child
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
gave
this
neglected
garden
over
to
her
.
``
Do
what
you
like
with
*NL*
it
,
''
he
said
to
her
.
This
amused
Cosette
;
she
turned
over
all
the
clumps
*NL*
and
all
the
stones
,
she
hunted
for
``
beasts
''
;
she
played
in
it
,
while
*NL*
awaiting
the
time
when
she
would
dream
in
it
;
she
loved
this
garden
*NL*
for
the
insects
that
she
found
beneath
her
feet
amid
the
grass
,
while
*NL*
awaiting
the
day
when
she
would
love
it
for
the
stars
that
she
would
see
*NL*
through
the
boughs
above
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
she
loved
her
father
,
that
is
to
say
,
Jean
Valjean
,
with
*NL*
all
her
soul
,
with
an
innocent
filial
passion
which
made
the
goodman
*NL*
a
beloved
and
charming
companion
to
her
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
had
been
in
the
habit
of
reading
a
great
deal
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
had
continued
this
practice
;
he
had
come
to
converse
well
;
he
possessed
*NL*
the
secret
riches
and
the
eloquence
of
a
true
and
humble
mind
which
has
*NL*
spontaneously
cultivated
itself
.
He
retained
just
enough
sharpness
to
*NL*
season
his
kindness
;
his
mind
was
rough
and
his
heart
was
soft
.
During
*NL*
their
conversations
in
the
Luxembourg
,
he
gave
her
explanations
of
*NL*
everything
,
drawing
on
what
he
had
read
,
and
also
on
what
he
had
*NL*
suffered
.
As
she
listened
to
him
,
Cosette
's
eyes
wandered
vaguely
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
simple
man
sufficed
for
Cosette
's
thought
,
the
same
as
the
wild
*NL*
garden
sufficed
for
her
eyes
.
When
she
had
had
a
good
chase
after
the
*NL*
butterflies
,
she
came
panting
up
to
him
and
said
:
``
Ah
!
How
I
have
run
!
''
*NL*
He
kissed
her
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
adored
the
goodman
.
She
was
always
at
his
heels
.
Where
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
,
there
happiness
was
.
Jean
Valjean
lived
neither
in
the
*NL*
pavilion
nor
the
garden
;
she
took
greater
pleasure
in
the
paved
back
*NL*
courtyard
,
than
in
the
enclosure
filled
with
flowers
,
and
in
his
little
*NL*
lodge
furnished
with
straw-seated
chairs
than
in
the
great
drawing-room
*NL*
hung
with
tapestry
,
against
which
stood
tufted
easy-chairs
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
sometimes
said
to
her
,
smiling
at
his
happiness
in
being
importuned
:
``
Do
*NL*
go
to
your
own
quarters
!
Leave
me
alone
a
little
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
him
those
charming
and
tender
scoldings
which
are
so
graceful
*NL*
when
they
come
from
a
daughter
to
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
am
very
cold
in
your
rooms
;
why
do
n't
you
have
a
carpet
here
*NL*
and
a
stove
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
child
,
there
are
so
many
people
who
are
better
than
I
and
who
have
*NL*
not
even
a
roof
over
their
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
is
there
a
fire
in
my
rooms
,
and
everything
that
is
needed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
a
woman
and
a
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
must
men
be
cold
and
feel
uncomfortable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certain
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
,
I
shall
come
here
so
often
that
you
will
be
obliged
to
*NL*
have
a
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
she
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
why
do
you
eat
horrible
bread
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
eat
it
,
I
will
eat
it
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
in
order
to
prevent
Cosette
eating
black
bread
,
Jean
Valjean
ate
*NL*
white
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
but
a
confused
recollection
of
her
childhood
.
She
prayed
*NL*
morning
and
evening
for
her
mother
whom
she
had
never
known
.
The
*NL*
Thenardiers
had
remained
with
her
as
two
hideous
figures
in
a
dream
.
She
*NL*
remembered
that
she
had
gone
``
one
day
,
at
night
,
''
to
fetch
water
in
a
*NL*
forest
.
She
thought
that
it
had
been
very
far
from
Paris
.
It
seemed
to
*NL*
her
that
she
had
begun
to
live
in
an
abyss
,
and
that
it
was
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
who
had
rescued
her
from
it
.
Her
childhood
produced
upon
her
the
effect
*NL*
of
a
time
when
there
had
been
nothing
around
her
but
millepeds
,
spiders
,
*NL*
and
serpents
.
When
she
meditated
in
the
evening
,
before
falling
asleep
,
*NL*
as
she
had
not
a
very
clear
idea
that
she
was
Jean
Valjean
's
daughter
,
*NL*
and
that
he
was
her
father
,
she
fancied
that
the
soul
of
her
mother
had
*NL*
passed
into
that
good
man
and
had
come
to
dwell
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
was
seated
,
she
leaned
her
cheek
against
his
white
hair
,
and
*NL*
dropped
a
silent
tear
,
saying
to
herself
:
``
Perhaps
this
man
is
my
*NL*
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
although
this
is
a
strange
statement
to
make
,
in
the
profound
*NL*
ignorance
of
a
girl
brought
up
in
a
convent
,
--
maternity
being
also
*NL*
absolutely
unintelligible
to
virginity
,
--
had
ended
by
fancying
that
she
*NL*
had
had
as
little
mother
as
possible
.
She
did
not
even
know
her
mother
's
*NL*
name
.
Whenever
she
asked
Jean
Valjean
,
Jean
Valjean
remained
silent
.
If
*NL*
she
repeated
her
question
,
he
responded
with
a
smile
.
Once
she
insisted
;
*NL*
the
smile
ended
in
a
tear
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
silence
on
the
part
of
Jean
Valjean
covered
Fantine
with
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
prudence
?
Was
it
respect
?
Was
it
a
fear
that
he
should
deliver
*NL*
this
name
to
the
hazards
of
another
memory
than
his
own
?
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
as
Cosette
had
been
small
,
Jean
Valjean
had
been
willing
to
talk
*NL*
to
her
of
her
mother
;
when
she
became
a
young
girl
,
it
was
impossible
*NL*
for
him
to
do
so
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
no
longer
dared
.
Was
it
*NL*
because
of
Cosette
?
Was
it
because
of
Fantine
?
He
felt
a
certain
*NL*
religious
horror
at
letting
that
shadow
enter
Cosette
's
thought
;
and
of
*NL*
placing
a
third
in
their
destiny
.
The
more
sacred
this
shade
was
to
him
,
*NL*
the
more
did
it
seem
that
it
was
to
be
feared
.
He
thought
of
Fantine
,
*NL*
and
felt
himself
overwhelmed
with
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
darkness
,
he
vaguely
perceived
something
which
appeared
*NL*
to
have
its
finger
on
its
lips
.
Had
all
the
modesty
which
had
been
*NL*
in
Fantine
,
and
which
had
violently
quitted
her
during
her
lifetime
,
*NL*
returned
to
rest
upon
her
after
her
death
,
to
watch
in
indignation
over
*NL*
the
peace
of
that
dead
woman
,
and
in
its
shyness
,
to
keep
her
in
her
*NL*
grave
?
Was
Jean
Valjean
unconsciously
submitting
to
the
pressure
?
We
*NL*
who
believe
in
death
,
are
not
among
the
number
who
will
reject
this
*NL*
mysterious
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
impossibility
of
uttering
,
even
for
Cosette
,
that
name
of
*NL*
Fantine
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Cosette
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
I
saw
my
mother
in
a
dream
last
night
.
She
had
two
big
wings
.
*NL*
My
mother
must
have
been
almost
a
saint
during
her
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Through
martyrdom
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
Jean
Valjean
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Cosette
went
out
with
him
,
she
leaned
on
his
arm
,
proud
and
happy
,
*NL*
in
the
plenitude
of
her
heart
.
Jean
Valjean
felt
his
heart
melt
within
*NL*
him
with
delight
,
at
all
these
sparks
of
a
tenderness
so
exclusive
,
so
*NL*
wholly
satisfied
with
himself
alone
.
The
poor
man
trembled
,
inundated
*NL*
with
angelic
joy
;
he
declared
to
himself
ecstatically
that
this
would
*NL*
last
all
their
lives
;
he
told
himself
that
he
really
had
not
suffered
*NL*
sufficiently
to
merit
so
radiant
a
bliss
,
and
he
thanked
God
,
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
his
soul
,
for
having
permitted
him
to
be
loved
thus
,
he
,
a
*NL*
wretch
,
by
that
innocent
being
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
ROSE
PERCEIVES
THAT
IT
IS
AN
ENGINE
OF
WAR
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
Cosette
chanced
to
look
at
herself
in
her
mirror
,
and
she
said
*NL*
to
herself
:
``
Really
!
''
It
seemed
to
her
almost
that
she
was
pretty
.
This
*NL*
threw
her
in
a
singularly
troubled
state
of
mind
.
Up
to
that
moment
she
*NL*
had
never
thought
of
her
face
.
She
saw
herself
in
her
mirror
,
but
she
*NL*
did
not
look
at
herself
.
And
then
,
she
had
so
often
been
told
that
she
*NL*
was
homely
;
Jean
Valjean
alone
said
gently
:
``
No
indeed
!
no
indeed
!
''
At
*NL*
all
events
,
Cosette
had
always
thought
herself
homely
,
and
had
grown
up
*NL*
in
that
belief
with
the
easy
resignation
of
childhood
.
And
here
,
all
*NL*
at
once
,
was
her
mirror
saying
to
her
,
as
Jean
Valjean
had
said
:
``
No
*NL*
indeed
!
''
That
night
,
she
did
not
sleep
.
``
What
if
I
were
pretty
!
''
she
*NL*
thought
.
``
How
odd
it
would
be
if
I
were
pretty
!
''
And
she
recalled
those
*NL*
of
her
companions
whose
beauty
had
produced
a
sensation
in
the
convent
,
*NL*
and
she
said
to
herself
:
``
What
!
Am
I
to
be
like
Mademoiselle
So-and-So
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
she
looked
at
herself
again
,
not
by
accident
this
time
,
*NL*
and
she
was
assailed
with
doubts
:
``
Where
did
I
get
such
an
idea
?
''
said
*NL*
she
;
``
no
,
I
am
ugly
.
''
She
had
not
slept
well
,
that
was
all
,
her
eyes
*NL*
were
sunken
and
she
was
pale
.
She
had
not
felt
very
joyous
on
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
in
the
belief
that
she
was
beautiful
,
but
it
made
her
*NL*
very
sad
not
to
be
able
to
believe
in
it
any
longer
.
She
did
not
look
at
*NL*
herself
again
,
and
for
more
than
a
fortnight
she
tried
to
dress
her
hair
*NL*
with
her
back
turned
to
the
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
,
after
dinner
,
she
generally
embroidered
in
wool
or
*NL*
did
some
convent
needlework
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
Jean
Valjean
read
*NL*
beside
her
.
Once
she
raised
her
eyes
from
her
work
,
and
was
rendered
*NL*
quite
uneasy
by
the
manner
in
which
her
father
was
gazing
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
another
occasion
,
she
was
passing
along
the
street
,
and
it
seemed
*NL*
to
her
that
some
one
behind
her
,
whom
she
did
not
see
,
said
:
``
A
pretty
*NL*
woman
!
but
badly
dressed
.
''
``
Bah
!
''
she
thought
,
``
he
does
not
mean
me
.
*NL*
I
am
well
dressed
and
ugly
.
''
She
was
then
wearing
a
plush
hat
and
her
*NL*
merino
gown
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
,
one
day
when
she
was
in
the
garden
,
she
heard
poor
old
*NL*
Toussaint
saying
:
``
Do
you
notice
how
pretty
Cosette
is
growing
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
Cosette
did
not
hear
her
father
's
reply
,
but
Toussaint
's
words
caused
*NL*
a
sort
of
commotion
within
her
.
She
fled
from
the
garden
,
ran
up
to
*NL*
her
room
,
flew
to
the
looking-glass
,
--
it
was
three
months
since
she
*NL*
had
looked
at
herself
,
--
and
gave
vent
to
a
cry
.
She
had
just
dazzled
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
beautiful
and
lovely
;
she
could
not
help
agreeing
with
Toussaint
*NL*
and
her
mirror
.
Her
figure
was
formed
,
her
skin
had
grown
white
,
her
*NL*
hair
was
lustrous
,
an
unaccustomed
splendor
had
been
lighted
in
her
blue
*NL*
eyes
.
The
consciousness
of
her
beauty
burst
upon
her
in
an
instant
,
like
*NL*
the
sudden
advent
of
daylight
;
other
people
noticed
it
also
,
Toussaint
*NL*
had
said
so
,
it
was
evidently
she
of
whom
the
passer-by
had
spoken
,
*NL*
there
could
no
longer
be
any
doubt
of
that
;
she
descended
to
the
garden
*NL*
again
,
thinking
herself
a
queen
,
imagining
that
she
heard
the
birds
*NL*
singing
,
though
it
was
winter
,
seeing
the
sky
gilded
,
the
sun
among
*NL*
the
trees
,
flowers
in
the
thickets
,
distracted
,
wild
,
in
inexpressible
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
on
his
side
,
experienced
a
deep
and
undefinable
oppression
*NL*
at
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
he
had
,
for
some
time
past
,
been
contemplating
with
terror
that
*NL*
beauty
which
seemed
to
grow
more
radiant
every
day
on
Cosette
's
sweet
*NL*
face
.
The
dawn
that
was
smiling
for
all
was
gloomy
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
been
beautiful
for
a
tolerably
long
time
before
she
became
*NL*
aware
of
it
herself
.
But
,
from
the
very
first
day
,
that
unexpected
light
*NL*
which
was
rising
slowly
and
enveloping
the
whole
of
the
young
girl
's
*NL*
person
,
wounded
Jean
Valjean
's
sombre
eye
.
He
felt
that
it
was
a
change
*NL*
in
a
happy
life
,
a
life
so
happy
that
he
did
not
dare
to
move
for
fear
*NL*
of
disarranging
something
.
This
man
,
who
had
passed
through
all
manner
*NL*
of
distresses
,
who
was
still
all
bleeding
from
the
bruises
of
fate
,
who
*NL*
had
been
almost
wicked
and
who
had
become
almost
a
saint
,
who
,
after
*NL*
having
dragged
the
chain
of
the
galleys
,
was
now
dragging
the
invisible
*NL*
but
heavy
chain
of
indefinite
misery
,
this
man
whom
the
law
had
not
*NL*
released
from
its
grasp
and
who
could
be
seized
at
any
moment
and
*NL*
brought
back
from
the
obscurity
of
his
virtue
to
the
broad
daylight
of
*NL*
public
opprobrium
,
this
man
accepted
all
,
excused
all
,
pardoned
all
,
and
*NL*
merely
asked
of
Providence
,
of
man
,
of
the
law
,
of
society
,
of
nature
,
*NL*
of
the
world
,
one
thing
,
that
Cosette
might
love
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
That
Cosette
might
continue
to
love
him
!
That
God
would
not
prevent
*NL*
the
heart
of
the
child
from
coming
to
him
,
and
from
remaining
with
him
!
*NL*
Beloved
by
Cosette
,
he
felt
that
he
was
healed
,
rested
,
appeased
,
loaded
*NL*
with
benefits
,
recompensed
,
crowned
.
Beloved
by
Cosette
,
it
was
well
*NL*
with
him
!
He
asked
nothing
more
!
Had
any
one
said
to
him
:
``
Do
you
want
*NL*
anything
better
?
''
he
would
have
answered
:
``
No
.
''
God
might
have
said
to
*NL*
him
:
``
Do
you
desire
heaven
?
''
and
he
would
have
replied
:
``
I
should
lose
*NL*
by
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
which
could
affect
this
situation
,
if
only
on
the
surface
,
*NL*
made
him
shudder
like
the
beginning
of
something
new
.
He
had
never
*NL*
known
very
distinctly
himself
what
the
beauty
of
a
woman
means
;
but
he
*NL*
understood
instinctively
,
that
it
was
something
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
with
terror
on
this
beauty
,
which
was
blossoming
out
ever
more
*NL*
triumphant
and
superb
beside
him
,
beneath
his
very
eyes
,
on
the
innocent
*NL*
and
formidable
brow
of
that
child
,
from
the
depths
of
her
homeliness
,
of
*NL*
his
old
age
,
of
his
misery
,
of
his
reprobation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
:
``
How
beautiful
she
is
!
What
is
to
become
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
moreover
,
lay
the
difference
between
his
tenderness
and
the
*NL*
tenderness
of
a
mother
.
What
he
beheld
with
anguish
,
a
mother
would
have
*NL*
gazed
upon
with
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
symptoms
were
not
long
in
making
their
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
very
morrow
of
the
day
on
which
she
had
said
to
herself
:
*NL*
``
Decidedly
I
am
beautiful
!
''
Cosette
began
to
pay
attention
to
her
*NL*
toilet
.
She
recalled
the
remark
of
that
passer-by
:
``
Pretty
,
but
badly
*NL*
dressed
,
''
the
breath
of
an
oracle
which
had
passed
beside
her
and
had
*NL*
vanished
,
after
depositing
in
her
heart
one
of
the
two
germs
which
are
*NL*
destined
,
later
on
,
to
fill
the
whole
life
of
woman
,
coquetry
.
Love
is
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
faith
in
her
beauty
,
the
whole
feminine
soul
expanded
within
her
.
*NL*
She
conceived
a
horror
for
her
merinos
,
and
shame
for
her
plush
hat
.
Her
*NL*
father
had
never
refused
her
anything
.
She
at
once
acquired
the
whole
*NL*
science
of
the
bonnet
,
the
gown
,
the
mantle
,
the
boot
,
the
cuff
,
the
*NL*
stuff
which
is
in
fashion
,
the
color
which
is
becoming
,
that
science
*NL*
which
makes
of
the
Parisian
woman
something
so
charming
,
so
deep
,
and
so
*NL*
dangerous
.
The
words
heady
woman
were
invented
for
the
Parisienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
less
than
a
month
,
little
Cosette
,
in
that
Thebaid
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Babylone
,
was
not
only
one
of
the
prettiest
,
but
one
of
the
``
best
*NL*
dressed
''
women
in
Paris
,
which
means
a
great
deal
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
have
liked
to
encounter
her
``
passer-by
,
''
to
see
what
he
would
*NL*
say
,
and
to
``
teach
him
a
lesson
!
''
The
truth
is
,
that
she
was
ravishing
*NL*
in
every
respect
,
and
that
she
distinguished
the
difference
between
a
*NL*
bonnet
from
Gerard
and
one
from
Herbaut
in
the
most
marvellous
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
watched
these
ravages
with
anxiety
.
He
who
felt
that
*NL*
he
could
never
do
anything
but
crawl
,
walk
at
the
most
,
beheld
wings
*NL*
sprouting
on
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
from
the
mere
inspection
of
Cosette
's
toilet
,
a
woman
*NL*
would
have
recognized
the
fact
that
she
had
no
mother
.
Certain
little
*NL*
proprieties
,
certain
special
conventionalities
,
were
not
observed
by
*NL*
Cosette
.
A
mother
,
for
instance
,
would
have
told
her
that
a
young
girl
*NL*
does
not
dress
in
damask
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
day
that
Cosette
went
out
in
her
black
damask
gown
and
mantle
,
*NL*
and
her
white
crape
bonnet
,
she
took
Jean
Valjean
's
arm
,
gay
,
radiant
,
*NL*
rosy
,
proud
,
dazzling
.
``
Father
,
''
she
said
,
``
how
do
you
like
me
in
this
*NL*
guise
?
''
Jean
Valjean
replied
in
a
voice
which
resembled
the
bitter
voice
*NL*
of
an
envious
man
:
``
Charming
!
''
He
was
the
same
as
usual
during
their
*NL*
walk
.
On
their
return
home
,
he
asked
Cosette
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
put
on
that
other
gown
and
bonnet
again
,
--
you
know
the
ones
I
*NL*
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
place
in
Cosette
's
chamber
.
Cosette
turned
towards
the
*NL*
wardrobe
where
her
cast-off
schoolgirl
's
clothes
were
hanging
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
disguise
!
''
said
she
.
``
Father
,
what
do
you
want
me
to
do
with
it
?
*NL*
Oh
no
,
the
idea
!
I
shall
never
put
on
those
horrors
again
.
With
that
*NL*
machine
on
my
head
,
I
have
the
air
of
Madame
Mad-dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
heaved
a
deep
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
forth
,
he
noticed
that
Cosette
,
who
had
always
*NL*
heretofore
asked
to
remain
at
home
,
saying
:
``
Father
,
I
enjoy
myself
more
*NL*
here
with
you
,
''
now
was
always
asking
to
go
out
.
In
fact
,
what
is
the
*NL*
use
of
having
a
handsome
face
and
a
delicious
costume
if
one
does
not
*NL*
display
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
also
noticed
that
Cosette
had
no
longer
the
same
taste
for
the
back
*NL*
garden
.
Now
she
preferred
the
garden
,
and
did
not
dislike
to
promenade
*NL*
back
and
forth
in
front
of
the
railed
fence
.
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
shy
,
*NL*
never
set
foot
in
the
garden
.
He
kept
to
his
back
yard
,
like
a
dog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
in
gaining
the
knowledge
that
she
was
beautiful
,
lost
the
grace
*NL*
of
ignoring
it
.
An
exquisite
grace
,
for
beauty
enhanced
by
ingenuousness
*NL*
is
ineffable
,
and
nothing
is
so
adorable
as
a
dazzling
and
innocent
*NL*
creature
who
walks
along
,
holding
in
her
hand
the
key
to
paradise
*NL*
without
being
conscious
of
it
.
But
what
she
had
lost
in
ingenuous
grace
,
*NL*
she
gained
in
pensive
and
serious
charm
.
Her
whole
person
,
permeated
*NL*
with
the
joy
of
youth
,
of
innocence
,
and
of
beauty
,
breathed
forth
a
*NL*
splendid
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
epoch
that
Marius
,
after
the
lapse
of
six
months
,
saw
her
*NL*
once
more
at
the
Luxembourg
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
BATTLE
BEGUN
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
in
her
shadow
,
like
Marius
in
his
,
was
all
ready
to
take
fire
.
*NL*
Destiny
,
with
its
mysterious
and
fatal
patience
,
slowly
drew
together
*NL*
these
two
beings
,
all
charged
and
all
languishing
with
the
stormy
*NL*
electricity
of
passion
,
these
two
souls
which
were
laden
with
love
as
*NL*
two
clouds
are
laden
with
lightning
,
and
which
were
bound
to
overflow
*NL*
and
mingle
in
a
look
like
the
clouds
in
a
flash
of
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glance
has
been
so
much
abused
in
love
romances
that
it
has
finally
*NL*
fallen
into
disrepute
.
One
hardly
dares
to
say
,
nowadays
,
that
two
*NL*
beings
fell
in
love
because
they
looked
at
each
other
.
That
is
the
way
*NL*
people
do
fall
in
love
,
nevertheless
,
and
the
only
way
.
The
rest
is
*NL*
nothing
,
but
the
rest
comes
afterwards
.
Nothing
is
more
real
than
these
*NL*
great
shocks
which
two
souls
convey
to
each
other
by
the
exchange
of
*NL*
that
spark
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
particular
hour
when
Cosette
unconsciously
darted
that
glance
*NL*
which
troubled
Marius
,
Marius
had
no
suspicion
that
he
had
also
launched
*NL*
a
look
which
disturbed
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
caused
her
the
same
good
and
the
same
evil
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
him
for
a
long
time
,
and
she
had
*NL*
scrutinized
him
as
girls
scrutinize
and
see
,
while
looking
elsewhere
.
*NL*
Marius
still
considered
Cosette
ugly
,
when
she
had
already
begun
to
*NL*
think
Marius
handsome
.
But
as
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
,
the
young
man
*NL*
was
nothing
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
she
could
not
refrain
from
saying
to
herself
that
he
had
*NL*
beautiful
hair
,
beautiful
eyes
,
handsome
teeth
,
a
charming
tone
of
voice
*NL*
when
she
heard
him
conversing
with
his
comrades
,
that
he
held
himself
*NL*
badly
when
he
walked
,
if
you
like
,
but
with
a
grace
that
was
all
his
*NL*
own
,
that
he
did
not
appear
to
be
at
all
stupid
,
that
his
whole
person
*NL*
was
noble
,
gentle
,
simple
,
proud
,
and
that
,
in
short
,
though
he
seemed
*NL*
to
be
poor
,
yet
his
air
was
fine
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
their
eyes
met
at
last
,
and
said
to
each
other
those
*NL*
first
,
obscure
,
and
ineffable
things
which
the
glance
lisps
,
Cosette
did
*NL*
not
immediately
understand
.
She
returned
thoughtfully
to
the
house
in
*NL*
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
where
Jean
Valjean
,
according
to
his
custom
,
had
*NL*
come
to
spend
six
weeks
.
The
next
morning
,
on
waking
,
she
thought
of
*NL*
that
strange
young
man
,
so
long
indifferent
and
icy
,
who
now
seemed
to
*NL*
pay
attention
to
her
,
and
it
did
not
appear
to
her
that
this
attention
*NL*
was
the
least
in
the
world
agreeable
to
her
.
She
was
,
on
the
contrary
,
*NL*
somewhat
incensed
at
this
handsome
and
disdainful
individual
.
A
*NL*
substratum
of
war
stirred
within
her
.
It
struck
her
,
and
the
idea
caused
*NL*
her
a
wholly
childish
joy
,
that
she
was
going
to
take
her
revenge
at
*NL*
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knowing
that
she
was
beautiful
,
she
was
thoroughly
conscious
,
though
*NL*
in
an
indistinct
fashion
,
that
she
possessed
a
weapon
.
Women
play
with
*NL*
their
beauty
as
children
do
with
a
knife
.
They
wound
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
recall
Marius
'
hesitations
,
his
palpitations
,
his
*NL*
terrors
.
He
remained
on
his
bench
and
did
not
approach
.
This
vexed
*NL*
Cosette
.
One
day
,
she
said
to
Jean
Valjean
:
``
Father
,
let
us
stroll
about
*NL*
a
little
in
that
direction
.
''
Seeing
that
Marius
did
not
come
to
her
,
*NL*
she
went
to
him
.
In
such
cases
,
all
women
resemble
Mahomet
.
And
then
,
*NL*
strange
to
say
,
the
first
symptom
of
true
love
in
a
young
man
is
*NL*
timidity
;
in
a
young
girl
it
is
boldness
.
This
is
surprising
,
and
yet
*NL*
nothing
is
more
simple
.
It
is
the
two
sexes
tending
to
approach
each
*NL*
other
and
assuming
,
each
the
other
's
qualities
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
,
Cosette
's
glance
drove
Marius
beside
himself
,
and
Marius
'
*NL*
glance
set
Cosette
to
trembling
.
Marius
went
away
confident
,
and
Cosette
*NL*
uneasy
.
From
that
day
forth
,
they
adored
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
that
Cosette
felt
was
a
confused
and
profound
*NL*
melancholy
.
It
seemed
to
her
that
her
soul
had
become
black
since
the
*NL*
day
before
.
She
no
longer
recognized
it
.
The
whiteness
of
soul
in
young
*NL*
girls
,
which
is
composed
of
coldness
and
gayety
,
resembles
snow
.
It
*NL*
melts
in
love
,
which
is
its
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
did
not
know
what
love
was
.
She
had
never
heard
the
word
uttered
*NL*
in
its
terrestrial
sense
.
On
the
books
of
profane
music
which
entered
*NL*
the
convent
,
amour
-LRB-
love
-RRB-
was
replaced
by
tambour
-LRB-
drum
-RRB-
or
pandour
.
*NL*
This
created
enigmas
which
exercised
the
imaginations
of
the
big
girls
,
*NL*
such
as
:
Ah
,
how
delightful
is
the
drum
!
or
,
Pity
is
not
a
pandour
.
But
*NL*
Cosette
had
left
the
convent
too
early
to
have
occupied
herself
much
*NL*
with
the
``
drum
.
''
Therefore
,
she
did
not
know
what
name
to
give
to
what
*NL*
she
now
felt
.
Is
any
one
the
less
ill
because
one
does
not
know
the
name
*NL*
of
one
's
malady
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
loved
with
all
the
more
passion
because
she
loved
ignorantly
.
She
*NL*
did
not
know
whether
it
was
a
good
thing
or
a
bad
thing
,
useful
or
*NL*
dangerous
,
eternal
or
temporary
,
allowable
or
prohibited
;
she
loved
.
She
*NL*
would
have
been
greatly
astonished
,
had
any
one
said
to
her
:
``
You
do
not
*NL*
sleep
?
But
that
is
forbidden
!
You
do
not
eat
?
Why
,
that
is
very
bad
!
You
*NL*
have
oppressions
and
palpitations
of
the
heart
?
That
must
not
be
!
You
*NL*
blush
and
turn
pale
,
when
a
certain
being
clad
in
black
appears
at
the
*NL*
end
of
a
certain
green
walk
?
But
that
is
abominable
!
''
She
would
not
have
*NL*
understood
,
and
she
would
have
replied
:
``
What
fault
is
there
of
mine
in
*NL*
a
matter
in
which
I
have
no
power
and
of
which
I
know
nothing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
turned
out
that
the
love
which
presented
itself
was
exactly
suited
to
*NL*
the
state
of
her
soul
.
It
was
a
sort
of
admiration
at
a
distance
,
a
mute
*NL*
contemplation
,
the
deification
of
a
stranger
.
It
was
the
apparition
of
*NL*
youth
to
youth
,
the
dream
of
nights
become
a
reality
yet
remaining
*NL*
a
dream
,
the
longed-for
phantom
realized
and
made
flesh
at
last
,
but
*NL*
having
as
yet
,
neither
name
,
nor
fault
,
nor
spot
,
nor
exigence
,
nor
*NL*
defect
;
in
a
word
,
the
distant
lover
who
lingered
in
the
ideal
,
a
*NL*
chimaera
with
a
form
.
Any
nearer
and
more
palpable
meeting
would
have
*NL*
alarmed
Cosette
at
this
first
stage
,
when
she
was
still
half
immersed
in
*NL*
the
exaggerated
mists
of
the
cloister
.
She
had
all
the
fears
of
children
*NL*
and
all
the
fears
of
nuns
combined
.
The
spirit
of
the
convent
,
with
*NL*
which
she
had
been
permeated
for
the
space
of
five
years
,
was
still
in
*NL*
the
process
of
slow
evaporation
from
her
person
,
and
made
everything
*NL*
tremble
around
her
.
In
this
situation
he
was
not
a
lover
,
he
was
not
*NL*
even
an
admirer
,
he
was
a
vision
.
She
set
herself
to
adoring
Marius
as
*NL*
something
charming
,
luminous
,
and
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
extreme
innocence
borders
on
extreme
coquetry
,
she
smiled
at
him
with
*NL*
all
frankness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
,
she
looked
forward
to
the
hour
for
their
walk
with
*NL*
impatience
,
she
found
Marius
there
,
she
felt
herself
unspeakably
happy
,
*NL*
and
thought
in
all
sincerity
that
she
was
expressing
her
whole
thought
*NL*
when
she
said
to
Jean
Valjean
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
delicious
garden
that
Luxembourg
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
and
Cosette
were
in
the
dark
as
to
one
another
.
They
did
not
*NL*
address
each
other
,
they
did
not
salute
each
other
,
they
did
not
know
*NL*
each
other
;
they
saw
each
other
;
and
like
stars
of
heaven
which
are
*NL*
separated
by
millions
of
leagues
,
they
lived
by
gazing
at
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
that
Cosette
gradually
became
a
woman
and
developed
,
*NL*
beautiful
and
loving
,
with
a
consciousness
of
her
beauty
,
and
in
*NL*
ignorance
of
her
love
.
She
was
a
coquette
to
boot
through
her
ignorance
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
TO
ONE
SADNESS
OPPOSE
A
SADNESS
AND
A
HALF
*NL*
*NL*
All
situations
have
their
instincts
.
Old
and
eternal
Mother
Nature
*NL*
warned
Jean
Valjean
in
a
dim
way
of
the
presence
of
Marius
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
shuddered
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
soul
.
Jean
Valjean
saw
nothing
,
knew
*NL*
nothing
,
and
yet
he
scanned
with
obstinate
attention
,
the
darkness
*NL*
in
which
he
walked
,
as
though
he
felt
on
one
side
of
him
something
in
*NL*
process
of
construction
,
and
on
the
other
,
something
which
was
crumbling
*NL*
away
.
Marius
,
also
warned
,
and
,
in
accordance
with
the
deep
law
of
God
,
*NL*
by
that
same
Mother
Nature
,
did
all
he
could
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
*NL*
``
the
father
.
''
Nevertheless
,
it
came
to
pass
that
Jean
Valjean
sometimes
*NL*
espied
him
.
Marius
'
manners
were
no
longer
in
the
least
natural
.
He
*NL*
exhibited
ambiguous
prudence
and
awkward
daring
.
He
no
longer
came
quite
*NL*
close
to
them
as
formerly
.
He
seated
himself
at
a
distance
and
pretended
*NL*
to
be
reading
;
why
did
he
pretend
that
?
Formerly
he
had
come
in
his
old
*NL*
coat
,
now
he
wore
his
new
one
every
day
;
Jean
Valjean
was
not
sure
*NL*
that
he
did
not
have
his
hair
curled
,
his
eyes
were
very
queer
,
he
wore
*NL*
gloves
;
in
short
,
Jean
Valjean
cordially
detested
this
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
allowed
nothing
to
be
divined
.
Without
knowing
just
what
was
the
*NL*
matter
with
her
she
was
convinced
that
there
was
something
in
it
,
and
*NL*
that
it
must
be
concealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
coincidence
between
the
taste
for
the
toilet
which
had
*NL*
recently
come
to
Cosette
,
and
the
habit
of
new
clothes
developed
by
*NL*
that
stranger
which
was
very
repugnant
to
Jean
Valjean
.
It
might
be
*NL*
accidental
,
no
doubt
,
certainly
,
but
it
was
a
menacing
accident
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
opened
his
mouth
to
Cosette
about
this
stranger
.
One
day
,
*NL*
however
,
he
could
not
refrain
from
so
doing
,
and
,
with
that
vague
*NL*
despair
which
suddenly
casts
the
lead
into
the
depths
of
its
despair
,
he
*NL*
said
to
her
:
``
What
a
very
pedantic
air
that
young
man
has
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
but
a
year
before
only
an
indifferent
little
girl
,
would
have
*NL*
replied
:
``
Why
,
no
,
he
is
charming
.
''
Ten
years
later
,
with
the
love
*NL*
of
Marius
in
her
heart
,
she
would
have
answered
:
``
A
pedant
,
and
*NL*
insufferable
to
the
sight
!
You
are
right
!
''
--
At
the
moment
in
life
*NL*
and
the
heart
which
she
had
then
attained
,
she
contented
herself
with
*NL*
replying
,
with
supreme
calmness
:
``
That
young
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
she
now
beheld
him
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupid
I
am
!
''
thought
Jean
Valjean
.
``
She
had
not
noticed
him
.
It
is
*NL*
I
who
have
pointed
him
out
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
simplicity
of
the
old
!
oh
,
the
depth
of
children
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
one
of
the
laws
of
those
fresh
years
of
suffering
and
trouble
,
of
*NL*
those
vivacious
conflicts
between
a
first
love
and
the
first
obstacles
,
*NL*
that
the
young
girl
does
not
allow
herself
to
be
caught
in
any
trap
*NL*
whatever
,
and
that
the
young
man
falls
into
every
one
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
had
instituted
an
undeclared
war
against
Marius
,
which
Marius
,
with
*NL*
the
sublime
stupidity
of
his
passion
and
his
age
,
did
not
divine
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
laid
a
host
of
ambushes
for
him
;
he
changed
his
hour
,
he
changed
*NL*
his
bench
,
he
forgot
his
handkerchief
,
he
came
alone
to
the
Luxembourg
;
*NL*
Marius
dashed
headlong
into
all
these
snares
;
and
to
all
the
*NL*
interrogation
marks
planted
by
Jean
Valjean
in
his
pathway
,
he
*NL*
ingenuously
answered
``
yes
.
''
But
Cosette
remained
immured
in
her
apparent
*NL*
unconcern
and
in
her
imperturbable
tranquillity
,
so
that
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
arrived
at
the
following
conclusion
:
``
That
ninny
is
madly
in
love
with
*NL*
Cosette
,
but
Cosette
does
not
even
know
that
he
exists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
None
the
less
did
he
bear
in
his
heart
a
mournful
tremor
.
The
minute
*NL*
when
Cosette
would
love
might
strike
at
any
moment
.
Does
not
everything
*NL*
begin
with
indifference
?
*NL*
*NL*
Only
once
did
Cosette
make
a
mistake
and
alarm
him
.
He
rose
from
his
*NL*
seat
to
depart
,
after
a
stay
of
three
hours
,
and
she
said
:
``
What
,
*NL*
already
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
not
discontinued
his
trips
to
the
Luxembourg
,
as
he
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
do
anything
out
of
the
way
,
and
as
,
above
all
things
,
*NL*
he
feared
to
arouse
Cosette
;
but
during
the
hours
which
were
so
sweet
*NL*
to
the
lovers
,
while
Cosette
was
sending
her
smile
to
the
intoxicated
*NL*
Marius
,
who
perceived
nothing
else
now
,
and
who
now
saw
nothing
in
all
*NL*
the
world
but
an
adored
and
radiant
face
,
Jean
Valjean
was
fixing
on
*NL*
Marius
flashing
and
terrible
eyes
.
He
,
who
had
finally
come
to
believe
*NL*
himself
incapable
of
a
malevolent
feeling
,
experienced
moments
when
*NL*
Marius
was
present
,
in
which
he
thought
he
was
becoming
savage
and
*NL*
ferocious
once
more
,
and
he
felt
the
old
depths
of
his
soul
,
which
*NL*
had
formerly
contained
so
much
wrath
,
opening
once
more
and
rising
up
*NL*
against
that
young
man
.
It
almost
seemed
to
him
that
unknown
craters
*NL*
were
forming
in
his
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
!
he
was
there
,
that
creature
!
What
was
he
there
for
?
He
came
*NL*
creeping
about
,
smelling
out
,
examining
,
trying
!
He
came
,
saying
:
``
Hey
!
*NL*
Why
not
?
''
He
came
to
prowl
about
his
,
Jean
Valjean
's
,
life
!
to
prowl
*NL*
about
his
happiness
,
with
the
purpose
of
seizing
it
and
bearing
it
away
!
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
added
:
``
Yes
,
that
's
it
!
What
is
he
in
search
of
?
An
*NL*
adventure
!
What
does
he
want
?
A
love
affair
!
A
love
affair
!
And
I
?
What
!
*NL*
I
have
been
first
,
the
most
wretched
of
men
,
and
then
the
most
unhappy
,
*NL*
and
I
have
traversed
sixty
years
of
life
on
my
knees
,
I
have
suffered
*NL*
everything
that
man
can
suffer
,
I
have
grown
old
without
having
been
*NL*
young
,
I
have
lived
without
a
family
,
without
relatives
,
without
*NL*
friends
,
without
life
,
without
children
,
I
have
left
my
blood
on
every
*NL*
stone
,
on
every
bramble
,
on
every
mile-post
,
along
every
wall
,
I
have
*NL*
been
gentle
,
though
others
have
been
hard
to
me
,
and
kind
,
although
*NL*
others
have
been
malicious
,
I
have
become
an
honest
man
once
more
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
everything
,
I
have
repented
of
the
evil
that
I
have
done
and
*NL*
have
forgiven
the
evil
that
has
been
done
to
me
,
and
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
I
receive
my
recompense
,
at
the
moment
when
it
is
all
over
,
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
I
am
just
touching
the
goal
,
at
the
moment
when
I
have
what
*NL*
I
desire
,
it
is
well
,
it
is
good
,
I
have
paid
,
I
have
earned
it
,
all
*NL*
this
is
to
take
flight
,
all
this
will
vanish
,
and
I
shall
lose
Cosette
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
lose
my
life
,
my
joy
,
my
soul
,
because
it
has
pleased
a
*NL*
great
booby
to
come
and
lounge
at
the
Luxembourg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
eyes
were
filled
with
a
sad
and
extraordinary
gleam
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
longer
a
man
gazing
at
a
man
;
it
was
no
longer
an
enemy
*NL*
surveying
an
enemy
.
It
was
a
dog
scanning
a
thief
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
knows
the
rest
.
Marius
pursued
his
senseless
course
.
One
day
*NL*
he
followed
Cosette
to
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
.
Another
day
he
spoke
to
*NL*
the
porter
.
The
porter
,
on
his
side
,
spoke
,
and
said
to
Jean
Valjean
:
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
who
is
that
curious
young
man
who
is
asking
for
you
?
''
On
the
*NL*
morrow
Jean
Valjean
bestowed
on
Marius
that
glance
which
Marius
at
last
*NL*
perceived
.
A
week
later
,
Jean
Valjean
had
taken
his
departure
.
He
swore
*NL*
to
himself
that
he
would
never
again
set
foot
either
in
the
Luxembourg
*NL*
or
in
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
.
He
returned
to
the
Rue
Plumet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
did
not
complain
,
she
said
nothing
,
she
asked
no
questions
,
she
*NL*
did
not
seek
to
learn
his
reasons
;
she
had
already
reached
the
point
*NL*
where
she
was
afraid
of
being
divined
,
and
of
betraying
herself
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
had
no
experience
of
these
miseries
,
the
only
miseries
which
*NL*
are
charming
and
the
only
ones
with
which
he
was
not
acquainted
;
the
*NL*
consequence
was
that
he
did
not
understand
the
grave
significance
of
*NL*
Cosette
's
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
merely
noticed
that
she
had
grown
sad
,
and
he
grew
gloomy
.
On
his
*NL*
side
and
on
hers
,
inexperience
had
joined
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
he
made
a
trial
.
He
asked
Cosette
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
come
to
the
Luxembourg
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
ray
illuminated
Cosette
's
pale
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
thither
.
Three
months
had
elapsed
.
Marius
no
longer
went
*NL*
there
.
Marius
was
not
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
Jean
Valjean
asked
Cosette
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
come
to
the
Luxembourg
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
,
sadly
and
gently
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
hurt
by
this
sadness
,
and
heart-broken
at
this
*NL*
gentleness
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
going
on
in
that
mind
which
was
so
young
and
yet
already
so
*NL*
impenetrable
?
What
was
on
its
way
there
within
?
What
was
taking
place
*NL*
in
Cosette
's
soul
?
Sometimes
,
instead
of
going
to
bed
,
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
remained
seated
on
his
pallet
,
with
his
head
in
his
hands
,
and
he
passed
*NL*
whole
nights
asking
himself
:
``
What
has
Cosette
in
her
mind
?
''
and
in
*NL*
thinking
of
the
things
that
she
might
be
thinking
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
at
such
moments
,
what
mournful
glances
did
he
cast
towards
that
*NL*
cloister
,
that
chaste
peak
,
that
abode
of
angels
,
that
inaccessible
*NL*
glacier
of
virtue
!
How
he
contemplated
,
with
despairing
ecstasy
,
that
*NL*
convent
garden
,
full
of
ignored
flowers
and
cloistered
virgins
,
where
*NL*
all
perfumes
and
all
souls
mount
straight
to
heaven
!
How
he
adored
that
*NL*
Eden
forever
closed
against
him
,
whence
he
had
voluntarily
and
madly
*NL*
emerged
!
How
he
regretted
his
abnegation
and
his
folly
in
having
brought
*NL*
Cosette
back
into
the
world
,
poor
hero
of
sacrifice
,
seized
and
hurled
*NL*
to
the
earth
by
his
very
self-devotion
!
How
he
said
to
himself
,
``
What
*NL*
have
I
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
nothing
of
all
this
was
perceptible
to
Cosette
.
No
ill-temper
,
*NL*
no
harshness
.
His
face
was
always
serene
and
kind
.
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
manners
were
more
tender
and
more
paternal
than
ever
.
If
anything
could
*NL*
have
betrayed
his
lack
of
joy
,
it
was
his
increased
suavity
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
side
,
Cosette
languished
.
She
suffered
from
the
absence
of
Marius
*NL*
as
she
had
rejoiced
in
his
presence
,
peculiarly
,
without
exactly
being
*NL*
conscious
of
it
.
When
Jean
Valjean
ceased
to
take
her
on
their
customary
*NL*
strolls
,
a
feminine
instinct
murmured
confusedly
,
at
the
bottom
of
her
*NL*
heart
,
that
she
must
not
seem
to
set
store
on
the
Luxembourg
garden
,
and
*NL*
that
if
this
proved
to
be
a
matter
of
indifference
to
her
,
her
father
*NL*
would
take
her
thither
once
more
.
But
days
,
weeks
,
months
,
elapsed
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
had
tacitly
accepted
Cosette
's
tacit
consent
.
She
regretted
it
.
*NL*
It
was
too
late
.
So
Marius
had
disappeared
;
all
was
over
.
The
day
on
*NL*
which
she
returned
to
the
Luxembourg
,
Marius
was
no
longer
there
.
What
*NL*
was
to
be
done
?
Should
she
ever
find
him
again
?
She
felt
an
anguish
at
*NL*
her
heart
,
which
nothing
relieved
,
and
which
augmented
every
day
;
she
no
*NL*
longer
knew
whether
it
was
winter
or
summer
,
whether
it
was
raining
or
*NL*
shining
,
whether
the
birds
were
singing
,
whether
it
was
the
season
for
*NL*
dahlias
or
daisies
,
whether
the
Luxembourg
was
more
charming
than
*NL*
the
Tuileries
,
whether
the
linen
which
the
laundress
brought
home
*NL*
was
starched
too
much
or
not
enough
,
whether
Toussaint
had
done
``
her
*NL*
marketing
''
well
or
ill
;
and
she
remained
dejected
,
absorbed
,
attentive
*NL*
to
but
a
single
thought
,
her
eyes
vague
and
staring
as
when
one
gazes
by
*NL*
night
at
a
black
and
fathomless
spot
where
an
apparition
has
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
she
did
not
allow
Jean
Valjean
to
perceive
anything
of
this
,
*NL*
except
her
pallor
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
still
wore
her
sweet
face
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pallor
sufficed
but
too
thoroughly
to
trouble
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
Sometimes
he
asked
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
:
``
There
is
nothing
the
matter
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
a
silence
,
when
she
divined
that
he
was
sad
also
,
she
would
*NL*
add
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
father
--
is
there
anything
wrong
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
me
?
Nothing
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
beings
who
had
loved
each
other
so
exclusively
,
and
with
so
*NL*
touching
an
affection
,
and
who
had
lived
so
long
for
each
other
*NL*
now
suffered
side
by
side
,
each
on
the
other
's
account
;
without
*NL*
acknowledging
it
to
each
other
,
without
anger
towards
each
other
,
and
*NL*
with
a
smile
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
CHAIN-GANG
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
the
more
unhappy
of
the
two
.
Youth
,
even
in
its
*NL*
sorrows
,
always
possesses
its
own
peculiar
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
,
Jean
Valjean
suffered
so
greatly
that
he
became
puerile
.
It
is
*NL*
the
property
of
grief
to
cause
the
childish
side
of
man
to
reappear
.
He
*NL*
had
an
unconquerable
conviction
that
Cosette
was
escaping
from
him
.
He
*NL*
would
have
liked
to
resist
,
to
retain
her
,
to
arouse
her
enthusiasm
by
*NL*
some
external
and
brilliant
matter
.
These
ideas
,
puerile
,
as
we
have
*NL*
just
said
,
and
at
the
same
time
senile
,
conveyed
to
him
,
by
their
very
*NL*
childishness
,
a
tolerably
just
notion
of
the
influence
of
gold
lace
on
*NL*
the
imaginations
of
young
girls
.
He
once
chanced
to
see
a
general
on
*NL*
horseback
,
in
full
uniform
,
pass
along
the
street
,
Comte
Coutard
,
the
*NL*
commandant
of
Paris
.
He
envied
that
gilded
man
;
what
happiness
it
*NL*
would
be
,
he
said
to
himself
,
if
he
could
put
on
that
suit
which
was
an
*NL*
incontestable
thing
;
and
if
Cosette
could
behold
him
thus
,
she
would
be
*NL*
dazzled
,
and
when
he
had
Cosette
on
his
arm
and
passed
the
gates
of
the
*NL*
Tuileries
,
the
guard
would
present
arms
to
him
,
and
that
would
suffice
*NL*
for
Cosette
,
and
would
dispel
her
idea
of
looking
at
young
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
unforeseen
shock
was
added
to
these
sad
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
isolated
life
which
they
led
,
and
since
they
had
come
to
dwell
*NL*
in
the
Rue
Plumet
,
they
had
contracted
one
habit
.
They
sometimes
took
*NL*
a
pleasure
trip
to
see
the
sun
rise
,
a
mild
species
of
enjoyment
which
*NL*
befits
those
who
are
entering
life
and
those
who
are
quitting
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
those
who
love
solitude
,
a
walk
in
the
early
morning
is
equivalent
*NL*
to
a
stroll
by
night
,
with
the
cheerfulness
of
nature
added
.
The
streets
*NL*
are
deserted
and
the
birds
are
singing
.
Cosette
,
a
bird
herself
,
liked
*NL*
to
rise
early
.
These
matutinal
excursions
were
planned
on
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
.
He
proposed
,
and
she
agreed
.
It
was
arranged
like
a
plot
,
they
*NL*
set
out
before
daybreak
,
and
these
trips
were
so
many
small
delights
for
*NL*
Cosette
.
These
innocent
eccentricities
please
young
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
inclination
led
him
,
as
we
have
seen
,
to
the
least
*NL*
frequented
spots
,
to
solitary
nooks
,
to
forgotten
places
.
There
then
*NL*
existed
,
in
the
vicinity
of
the
barriers
of
Paris
,
a
sort
of
poor
*NL*
meadows
,
which
were
almost
confounded
with
the
city
,
where
grew
in
*NL*
summer
sickly
grain
,
and
which
,
in
autumn
,
after
the
harvest
had
been
*NL*
gathered
,
presented
the
appearance
,
not
of
having
been
reaped
,
but
*NL*
peeled
.
Jean
Valjean
loved
to
haunt
these
fields
.
Cosette
was
not
bored
*NL*
there
.
It
meant
solitude
to
him
and
liberty
to
her
.
There
,
she
became
a
*NL*
little
girl
once
more
,
she
could
run
and
almost
play
;
she
took
off
her
*NL*
hat
,
laid
it
on
Jean
Valjean
's
knees
,
and
gathered
bunches
of
flowers
.
*NL*
She
gazed
at
the
butterflies
on
the
flowers
,
but
did
not
catch
them
;
*NL*
gentleness
and
tenderness
are
born
with
love
,
and
the
young
girl
who
*NL*
cherishes
within
her
breast
a
trembling
and
fragile
ideal
has
mercy
on
*NL*
the
wing
of
a
butterfly
.
She
wove
garlands
of
poppies
,
which
she
placed
*NL*
on
her
head
,
and
which
,
crossed
and
penetrated
with
sunlight
,
glowing
*NL*
until
they
flamed
,
formed
for
her
rosy
face
a
crown
of
burning
embers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
after
their
life
had
grown
sad
,
they
kept
up
their
custom
of
early
*NL*
strolls
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
in
October
,
therefore
,
tempted
by
the
serene
perfection
of
*NL*
the
autumn
of
1831
,
they
set
out
,
and
found
themselves
at
break
of
*NL*
day
near
the
Barriere
du
Maine
.
It
was
not
dawn
,
it
was
daybreak
;
a
*NL*
delightful
and
stern
moment
.
A
few
constellations
here
and
there
in
the
*NL*
deep
,
pale
azure
,
the
earth
all
black
,
the
heavens
all
white
,
a
quiver
*NL*
amid
the
blades
of
grass
,
everywhere
the
mysterious
chill
of
twilight
.
A
*NL*
lark
,
which
seemed
mingled
with
the
stars
,
was
carolling
at
a
prodigious
*NL*
height
,
and
one
would
have
declared
that
that
hymn
of
pettiness
calmed
*NL*
immensity
.
In
the
East
,
the
Valde-Grace
projected
its
dark
mass
on
the
*NL*
clear
horizon
with
the
sharpness
of
steel
;
Venus
dazzlingly
brilliant
*NL*
was
rising
behind
that
dome
and
had
the
air
of
a
soul
making
its
escape
*NL*
from
a
gloomy
edifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
peace
and
silence
;
there
was
no
one
on
the
road
;
a
few
stray
*NL*
laborers
,
of
whom
they
caught
barely
a
glimpse
,
were
on
their
way
to
*NL*
their
work
along
the
side-paths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
sitting
in
a
cross-walk
on
some
planks
deposited
at
the
*NL*
gate
of
a
timber-yard
.
His
face
was
turned
towards
the
highway
,
his
back
*NL*
towards
the
light
;
he
had
forgotten
the
sun
which
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
rising
;
he
had
sunk
into
one
of
those
profound
absorptions
in
which
the
*NL*
mind
becomes
concentrated
,
which
imprison
even
the
eye
,
and
which
are
*NL*
equivalent
to
four
walls
.
There
are
meditations
which
may
be
called
*NL*
vertical
;
when
one
is
at
the
bottom
of
them
,
time
is
required
to
return
*NL*
to
earth
.
Jean
Valjean
had
plunged
into
one
of
these
reveries
.
He
was
*NL*
thinking
of
Cosette
,
of
the
happiness
that
was
possible
if
nothing
came
*NL*
between
him
and
her
,
of
the
light
with
which
she
filled
his
life
,
a
*NL*
light
which
was
but
the
emanation
of
her
soul
.
He
was
almost
happy
in
*NL*
his
revery
.
Cosette
,
who
was
standing
beside
him
,
was
gazing
at
the
*NL*
clouds
as
they
turned
rosy
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
Cosette
exclaimed
:
``
Father
,
I
should
think
some
one
was
*NL*
coming
yonder
.
''
Jean
Valjean
raised
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
right
.
The
causeway
which
leads
to
the
ancient
Barriere
du
*NL*
Maine
is
a
prolongation
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
of
the
Rue
de
Sevres
,
*NL*
and
is
cut
at
right
angles
by
the
inner
boulevard
.
At
the
elbow
of
the
*NL*
causeway
and
the
boulevard
,
at
the
spot
where
it
branches
,
they
heard
a
*NL*
noise
which
it
was
difficult
to
account
for
at
that
hour
,
and
a
sort
of
*NL*
confused
pile
made
its
appearance
.
Some
shapeless
thing
which
was
coming
*NL*
from
the
boulevard
was
turning
into
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
grew
larger
,
it
seemed
to
move
in
an
orderly
manner
,
though
it
was
*NL*
bristling
and
quivering
;
it
seemed
to
be
a
vehicle
,
but
its
load
could
*NL*
not
be
distinctly
made
out
.
There
were
horses
,
wheels
,
shouts
;
whips
*NL*
were
cracking
.
By
degrees
the
outlines
became
fixed
,
although
bathed
*NL*
in
shadows
.
It
was
a
vehicle
,
in
fact
,
which
had
just
turned
from
the
*NL*
boulevard
into
the
highway
,
and
which
was
directing
its
course
towards
*NL*
the
barrier
near
which
sat
Jean
Valjean
;
a
second
,
of
the
same
aspect
,
*NL*
followed
,
then
a
third
,
then
a
fourth
;
seven
chariots
made
their
*NL*
appearance
in
succession
,
the
heads
of
the
horses
touching
the
rear
of
*NL*
the
wagon
in
front
.
Figures
were
moving
on
these
vehicles
,
flashes
were
*NL*
visible
through
the
dusk
as
though
there
were
naked
swords
there
,
a
*NL*
clanking
became
audible
which
resembled
the
rattling
of
chains
,
and
as
*NL*
this
something
advanced
,
the
sound
of
voices
waxed
louder
,
and
it
turned
*NL*
into
a
terrible
thing
such
as
emerges
from
the
cave
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
drew
nearer
,
it
assumed
a
form
,
and
was
outlined
behind
the
trees
*NL*
with
the
pallid
hue
of
an
apparition
;
the
mass
grew
white
;
the
day
,
*NL*
which
was
slowly
dawning
,
cast
a
wan
light
on
this
swarming
heap
which
*NL*
was
at
once
both
sepulchral
and
living
,
the
heads
of
the
figures
turned
*NL*
into
the
faces
of
corpses
,
and
this
is
what
it
proved
to
be
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
wagons
were
driving
in
a
file
along
the
road
.
The
first
six
were
*NL*
singularly
constructed
.
They
resembled
coopers
'
drays
;
they
consisted
*NL*
of
long
ladders
placed
on
two
wheels
and
forming
barrows
at
their
rear
*NL*
extremities
.
Each
dray
,
or
rather
let
us
say
,
each
ladder
,
was
attached
*NL*
to
four
horses
harnessed
tandem
.
On
these
ladders
strange
clusters
of
*NL*
men
were
being
drawn
.
In
the
faint
light
,
these
men
were
to
be
divined
*NL*
rather
than
seen
.
Twenty-four
on
each
vehicle
,
twelve
on
a
side
,
back
to
*NL*
back
,
facing
the
passers-by
,
their
legs
dangling
in
the
air
,
--
this
was
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
these
men
were
travelling
,
and
behind
their
backs
*NL*
they
had
something
which
clanked
,
and
which
was
a
chain
,
and
on
their
*NL*
necks
something
which
shone
,
and
which
was
an
iron
collar
.
Each
man
had
*NL*
his
collar
,
but
the
chain
was
for
all
;
so
that
if
these
four
and
twenty
*NL*
men
had
occasion
to
alight
from
the
dray
and
walk
,
they
were
seized
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
inexorable
unity
,
and
were
obliged
to
wind
over
the
ground
*NL*
with
the
chain
for
a
backbone
,
somewhat
after
the
fashion
of
millepeds
.
*NL*
In
the
back
and
front
of
each
vehicle
,
two
men
armed
with
muskets
*NL*
stood
erect
,
each
holding
one
end
of
the
chain
under
his
foot
.
The
iron
*NL*
necklets
were
square
.
The
seventh
vehicle
,
a
huge
rack-sided
baggage
*NL*
wagon
,
without
a
hood
,
had
four
wheels
and
six
horses
,
and
carried
a
*NL*
sonorous
pile
of
iron
boilers
,
cast-iron
pots
,
braziers
,
and
chains
,
*NL*
among
which
were
mingled
several
men
who
were
pinioned
and
stretched
at
*NL*
full
length
,
and
who
seemed
to
be
ill
.
This
wagon
,
all
lattice-work
,
*NL*
was
garnished
with
dilapidated
hurdles
which
appeared
to
have
served
for
*NL*
former
punishments
.
These
vehicles
kept
to
the
middle
of
the
road
.
On
*NL*
each
side
marched
a
double
hedge
of
guards
of
infamous
aspect
,
wearing
*NL*
three-cornered
hats
,
like
the
soldiers
under
the
Directory
,
shabby
,
*NL*
covered
with
spots
and
holes
,
muffled
in
uniforms
of
veterans
and
the
*NL*
trousers
of
undertakers
'
men
,
half
gray
,
half
blue
,
which
were
almost
*NL*
hanging
in
rags
,
with
red
epaulets
,
yellow
shoulder
belts
,
short
sabres
,
*NL*
muskets
,
and
cudgels
;
they
were
a
species
of
soldier-blackguards
.
*NL*
These
myrmidons
seemed
composed
of
the
abjectness
of
the
beggar
and
the
*NL*
authority
of
the
executioner
.
The
one
who
appeared
to
be
their
chief
*NL*
held
a
postilion
's
whip
in
his
hand
.
All
these
details
,
blurred
by
the
*NL*
dimness
of
dawn
,
became
more
and
more
clearly
outlined
as
the
light
*NL*
increased
.
At
the
head
and
in
the
rear
of
the
convoy
rode
mounted
*NL*
gendarmes
,
serious
and
with
sword
in
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
procession
was
so
long
that
when
the
first
vehicle
reached
the
*NL*
barrier
,
the
last
was
barely
debauching
from
the
boulevard
.
A
throng
,
*NL*
sprung
,
it
is
impossible
to
say
whence
,
and
formed
in
a
twinkling
,
as
*NL*
is
frequently
the
case
in
Paris
,
pressed
forward
from
both
sides
of
*NL*
the
road
and
looked
on
.
In
the
neighboring
lanes
the
shouts
of
people
*NL*
calling
to
each
other
and
the
wooden
shoes
of
market-gardeners
hastening
*NL*
up
to
gaze
were
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
massed
upon
the
drays
allowed
themselves
to
be
jolted
along
in
*NL*
silence
.
They
were
livid
with
the
chill
of
morning
.
They
all
wore
linen
*NL*
trousers
,
and
their
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
wooden
shoes
.
The
rest
*NL*
of
their
costume
was
a
fantasy
of
wretchedness
.
Their
accoutrements
were
*NL*
horribly
incongruous
;
nothing
is
more
funereal
than
the
harlequin
in
*NL*
rags
.
Battered
felt
hats
,
tarpaulin
caps
,
hideous
woollen
nightcaps
,
*NL*
and
,
side
by
side
with
a
short
blouse
,
a
black
coat
broken
at
the
elbow
;
*NL*
many
wore
women
's
headgear
,
others
had
baskets
on
their
heads
;
hairy
*NL*
breasts
were
visible
,
and
through
the
rent
in
their
garments
tattooed
*NL*
designs
could
be
descried
;
temples
of
Love
,
flaming
hearts
,
Cupids
;
*NL*
eruptions
and
unhealthy
red
blotches
could
also
be
seen
.
Two
or
three
*NL*
had
a
straw
rope
attached
to
the
cross-bar
of
the
dray
,
and
suspended
*NL*
under
them
like
a
stirrup
,
which
supported
their
feet
.
One
of
them
held
*NL*
in
his
hand
and
raised
to
his
mouth
something
which
had
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
black
stone
and
which
he
seemed
to
be
gnawing
;
it
was
bread
which
*NL*
he
was
eating
.
There
were
no
eyes
there
which
were
not
either
dry
,
*NL*
dulled
,
or
flaming
with
an
evil
light
.
The
escort
troop
cursed
,
the
men
*NL*
in
chains
did
not
utter
a
syllable
;
from
time
to
time
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
blow
became
audible
as
the
cudgels
descended
on
shoulder-blades
or
*NL*
skulls
;
some
of
these
men
were
yawning
;
their
rags
were
terrible
;
*NL*
their
feet
hung
down
,
their
shoulders
oscillated
,
their
heads
clashed
*NL*
together
,
their
fetters
clanked
,
their
eyes
glared
ferociously
,
their
*NL*
fists
clenched
or
fell
open
inertly
like
the
hands
of
corpses
;
in
the
*NL*
rear
of
the
convoy
ran
a
band
of
children
screaming
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
file
of
vehicles
,
whatever
its
nature
was
,
was
mournful
.
It
*NL*
was
evident
that
to-morrow
,
that
an
hour
hence
,
a
pouring
rain
might
*NL*
descend
,
that
it
might
be
followed
by
another
and
another
,
and
that
*NL*
their
dilapidated
garments
would
be
drenched
,
that
once
soaked
,
these
*NL*
men
would
not
get
dry
again
,
that
once
chilled
,
they
would
not
again
*NL*
get
warm
,
that
their
linen
trousers
would
be
glued
to
their
bones
by
the
*NL*
downpour
,
that
the
water
would
fill
their
shoes
,
that
no
lashes
from
*NL*
the
whips
would
be
able
to
prevent
their
jaws
from
chattering
,
that
the
*NL*
chain
would
continue
to
bind
them
by
the
neck
,
that
their
legs
would
*NL*
continue
to
dangle
,
and
it
was
impossible
not
to
shudder
at
the
sight
*NL*
of
these
human
beings
thus
bound
and
passive
beneath
the
cold
clouds
of
*NL*
autumn
,
and
delivered
over
to
the
rain
,
to
the
blast
,
to
all
the
furies
*NL*
of
the
air
,
like
trees
and
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Blows
from
the
cudgel
were
not
omitted
even
in
the
case
of
the
sick
men
,
*NL*
who
lay
there
knotted
with
ropes
and
motionless
on
the
seventh
wagon
,
*NL*
and
who
appeared
to
have
been
tossed
there
like
sacks
filled
with
*NL*
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
the
sun
made
its
appearance
;
the
immense
light
of
the
Orient
*NL*
burst
forth
,
and
one
would
have
said
that
it
had
set
fire
to
all
those
*NL*
ferocious
heads
.
Their
tongues
were
unloosed
;
a
conflagration
of
grins
,
*NL*
oaths
,
and
songs
exploded
.
The
broad
horizontal
sheet
of
light
severed
*NL*
the
file
in
two
parts
,
illuminating
heads
and
bodies
,
leaving
feet
and
*NL*
wheels
in
the
obscurity
.
Thoughts
made
their
appearance
on
these
faces
;
*NL*
it
was
a
terrible
moment
;
visible
demons
with
their
masks
removed
,
*NL*
fierce
souls
laid
bare
.
Though
lighted
up
,
this
wild
throng
remained
in
*NL*
gloom
.
Some
,
who
were
gay
,
had
in
their
mouths
quills
through
which
they
*NL*
blew
vermin
over
the
crowd
,
picking
out
the
women
;
the
dawn
accentuated
*NL*
these
lamentable
profiles
with
the
blackness
of
its
shadows
;
there
*NL*
was
not
one
of
these
creatures
who
was
not
deformed
by
reason
of
*NL*
wretchedness
;
and
the
whole
was
so
monstrous
that
one
would
have
*NL*
said
that
the
sun
's
brilliancy
had
been
changed
into
the
glare
of
the
*NL*
lightning
.
The
wagon-load
which
headed
the
line
had
struck
up
a
song
,
*NL*
and
were
shouting
at
the
top
of
their
voices
with
a
haggard
joviality
,
*NL*
a
potpourri
by
Desaugiers
,
then
famous
,
called
The
Vestal
;
the
trees
*NL*
shivered
mournfully
;
in
the
cross-lanes
,
countenances
of
bourgeois
*NL*
listened
in
an
idiotic
delight
to
these
coarse
strains
droned
by
*NL*
spectres
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
sorts
of
distress
met
in
this
procession
as
in
chaos
;
here
were
to
*NL*
be
found
the
facial
angles
of
every
sort
of
beast
,
old
men
,
youths
,
*NL*
bald
heads
,
gray
beards
,
cynical
monstrosities
,
sour
resignation
,
savage
*NL*
grins
,
senseless
attitudes
,
snouts
surmounted
by
caps
,
heads
like
those
*NL*
of
young
girls
with
corkscrew
curls
on
the
temples
,
infantile
visages
,
*NL*
and
by
reason
of
that
,
horrible
thin
skeleton
faces
,
to
which
death
*NL*
alone
was
lacking
.
On
the
first
cart
was
a
negro
,
who
had
been
a
slave
,
*NL*
in
all
probability
,
and
who
could
make
a
comparison
of
his
chains
.
The
*NL*
frightful
leveller
from
below
,
shame
,
had
passed
over
these
brows
;
at
*NL*
that
degree
of
abasement
,
the
last
transformations
were
suffered
by
all
*NL*
in
their
extremest
depths
,
and
ignorance
,
converted
into
dulness
,
was
*NL*
the
equal
of
intelligence
converted
into
despair
.
There
was
no
choice
*NL*
possible
between
these
men
who
appeared
to
the
eye
as
the
flower
of
the
*NL*
mud
.
It
was
evident
that
the
person
who
had
had
the
ordering
of
that
*NL*
unclean
procession
had
not
classified
them
.
These
beings
had
been
*NL*
fettered
and
coupled
pell-mell
,
in
alphabetical
disorder
,
probably
,
and
*NL*
loaded
hap-hazard
on
those
carts
.
Nevertheless
,
horrors
,
when
grouped
*NL*
together
,
always
end
by
evolving
a
result
;
all
additions
of
wretched
men
*NL*
give
a
sum
total
,
each
chain
exhaled
a
common
soul
,
and
each
dray-load
*NL*
had
its
own
physiognomy
.
By
the
side
of
the
one
where
they
were
singing
,
*NL*
there
was
one
where
they
were
howling
;
a
third
where
they
were
begging
;
*NL*
one
could
be
seen
in
which
they
were
gnashing
their
teeth
;
another
load
*NL*
menaced
the
spectators
,
another
blasphemed
God
;
the
last
was
as
silent
*NL*
as
the
tomb
.
Dante
would
have
thought
that
he
beheld
his
seven
circles
*NL*
of
hell
on
the
march
.
The
march
of
the
damned
to
their
tortures
,
*NL*
performed
in
sinister
wise
,
not
on
the
formidable
and
flaming
chariot
*NL*
of
the
Apocalypse
,
but
,
what
was
more
mournful
than
that
,
on
the
gibbet
*NL*
cart
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
guards
,
who
had
a
hook
on
the
end
of
his
cudgel
,
made
a
*NL*
pretence
from
time
to
time
,
of
stirring
up
this
mass
of
human
filth
.
*NL*
An
old
woman
in
the
crowd
pointed
them
out
to
her
little
boy
five
years
*NL*
old
,
and
said
to
him
:
``
Rascal
,
let
that
be
a
warning
to
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
songs
and
blasphemies
increased
,
the
man
who
appeared
to
be
the
*NL*
captain
of
the
escort
cracked
his
whip
,
and
at
that
signal
a
fearful
*NL*
dull
and
blind
flogging
,
which
produced
the
sound
of
hail
,
fell
upon
the
*NL*
seven
dray-loads
;
many
roared
and
foamed
at
the
mouth
;
which
redoubled
*NL*
the
delight
of
the
street
urchins
who
had
hastened
up
,
a
swarm
of
flies
*NL*
on
these
wounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
eyes
had
assumed
a
frightful
expression
.
They
were
no
*NL*
longer
eyes
;
they
were
those
deep
and
glassy
objects
which
replace
the
*NL*
glance
in
the
case
of
certain
wretched
men
,
which
seem
unconscious
*NL*
of
reality
,
and
in
which
flames
the
reflection
of
terrors
and
of
*NL*
catastrophes
.
He
was
not
looking
at
a
spectacle
,
he
was
seeing
a
vision
.
*NL*
He
tried
to
rise
,
to
flee
,
to
make
his
escape
;
he
could
not
move
his
*NL*
feet
.
Sometimes
,
the
things
that
you
see
seize
upon
you
and
hold
you
*NL*
fast
.
He
remained
nailed
to
the
spot
,
petrified
,
stupid
,
asking
himself
,
*NL*
athwart
confused
and
inexpressible
anguish
,
what
this
sepulchral
*NL*
persecution
signified
,
and
whence
had
come
that
pandemonium
which
was
*NL*
pursuing
him
.
All
at
once
,
he
raised
his
hand
to
his
brow
,
a
gesture
*NL*
habitual
to
those
whose
memory
suddenly
returns
;
he
remembered
that
this
*NL*
was
,
in
fact
,
the
usual
itinerary
,
that
it
was
customary
to
make
this
*NL*
detour
in
order
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
encountering
royalty
on
the
*NL*
road
to
Fontainebleau
,
and
that
,
five
and
thirty
years
before
,
he
had
*NL*
himself
passed
through
that
barrier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
no
less
terrified
,
but
in
a
different
way
.
She
did
not
*NL*
understand
;
what
she
beheld
did
not
seem
to
her
to
be
possible
;
at
*NL*
length
she
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
What
are
those
men
in
those
carts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
replied
:
``
Convicts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whither
are
they
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
galleys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
cudgelling
,
multiplied
by
a
hundred
hands
,
became
*NL*
zealous
,
blows
with
the
flat
of
the
sword
were
mingled
with
it
,
it
was
a
*NL*
perfect
storm
of
whips
and
clubs
;
the
convicts
bent
before
it
,
a
hideous
*NL*
obedience
was
evoked
by
the
torture
,
and
all
held
their
peace
,
darting
*NL*
glances
like
chained
wolves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
trembled
in
every
limb
;
she
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
are
they
still
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
''
answered
the
unhappy
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
chain-gang
,
in
fact
,
which
had
set
out
before
daybreak
from
*NL*
Bicetre
,
and
had
taken
the
road
to
Mans
in
order
to
avoid
Fontainebleau
,
*NL*
where
the
King
then
was
.
This
caused
the
horrible
journey
to
last
three
*NL*
or
four
days
longer
;
but
torture
may
surely
be
prolonged
with
the
object
*NL*
of
sparing
the
royal
personage
a
sight
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
returned
home
utterly
overwhelmed
.
Such
encounters
are
*NL*
shocks
,
and
the
memory
that
they
leave
behind
them
resembles
a
thorough
*NL*
shaking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Jean
Valjean
did
not
observe
that
,
on
his
way
back
to
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Babylone
with
Cosette
,
the
latter
was
plying
him
with
other
*NL*
questions
on
the
subject
of
what
they
had
just
seen
;
perhaps
he
was
*NL*
too
much
absorbed
in
his
own
dejection
to
notice
her
words
and
reply
to
*NL*
them
.
But
when
Cosette
was
leaving
him
in
the
evening
,
to
betake
herself
*NL*
to
bed
,
he
heard
her
say
in
a
low
voice
,
and
as
though
talking
to
*NL*
herself
:
``
It
seems
to
me
,
that
if
I
were
to
find
one
of
those
men
in
my
*NL*
pathway
,
oh
,
my
God
,
I
should
die
merely
from
the
sight
of
him
close
at
*NL*
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fortunately
,
chance
ordained
that
on
the
morrow
of
that
tragic
day
,
*NL*
there
was
some
official
solemnity
apropos
of
I
know
not
what
,
--
fetes
in
*NL*
Paris
,
a
review
in
the
Champ
de
Mars
,
jousts
on
the
Seine
,
theatrical
*NL*
performances
in
the
Champs-Elysees
,
fireworks
at
the
Arc
de
l'Etoile
,
*NL*
illuminations
everywhere
.
Jean
Valjean
did
violence
to
his
habits
,
and
*NL*
took
Cosette
to
see
these
rejoicings
,
for
the
purpose
of
diverting
her
*NL*
from
the
memory
of
the
day
before
,
and
of
effacing
,
beneath
the
smiling
*NL*
tumult
of
all
Paris
,
the
abominable
thing
which
had
passed
before
her
.
*NL*
The
review
with
which
the
festival
was
spiced
made
the
presence
of
*NL*
uniforms
perfectly
natural
;
Jean
Valjean
donned
his
uniform
of
a
*NL*
national
guard
with
the
vague
inward
feeling
of
a
man
who
is
betaking
*NL*
himself
to
shelter
.
However
,
this
trip
seemed
to
attain
its
object
.
*NL*
Cosette
,
who
made
it
her
law
to
please
her
father
,
and
to
whom
,
*NL*
moreover
,
all
spectacles
were
a
novelty
,
accepted
this
diversion
*NL*
with
the
light
and
easy
good
grace
of
youth
,
and
did
not
pout
too
*NL*
disdainfully
at
that
flutter
of
enjoyment
called
a
public
fete
;
so
that
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
able
to
believe
that
he
had
succeeded
,
and
that
no
*NL*
trace
of
that
hideous
vision
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
days
later
,
one
morning
,
when
the
sun
was
shining
brightly
,
and
*NL*
they
were
both
on
the
steps
leading
to
the
garden
,
another
infraction
of
*NL*
the
rules
which
Jean
Valjean
seemed
to
have
imposed
upon
himself
,
and
*NL*
to
the
custom
of
remaining
in
her
chamber
which
melancholy
had
caused
*NL*
Cosette
to
adopt
,
Cosette
,
in
a
wrapper
,
was
standing
erect
in
that
*NL*
negligent
attire
of
early
morning
which
envelops
young
girls
in
an
*NL*
adorable
way
and
which
produces
the
effect
of
a
cloud
drawn
over
a
star
;
*NL*
and
,
with
her
head
bathed
in
light
,
rosy
after
a
good
sleep
,
submitting
*NL*
to
the
gentle
glances
of
the
tender
old
man
,
she
was
picking
a
daisy
*NL*
to
pieces
.
Cosette
did
not
know
the
delightful
legend
,
I
love
a
little
,
*NL*
passionately
,
etc.
--
who
was
there
who
could
have
taught
her
?
She
was
*NL*
handling
the
flower
instinctively
,
innocently
,
without
a
suspicion
that
*NL*
to
pluck
a
daisy
apart
is
to
do
the
same
by
a
heart
.
If
there
were
a
*NL*
fourth
,
and
smiling
Grace
called
Melancholy
,
she
would
have
worn
the
air
*NL*
of
that
Grace
.
Jean
Valjean
was
fascinated
by
the
contemplation
of
those
*NL*
tiny
fingers
on
that
flower
,
and
forgetful
of
everything
in
the
radiance
*NL*
emitted
by
that
child
.
A
red-breast
was
warbling
in
the
thicket
,
on
one
*NL*
side
.
White
cloudlets
floated
across
the
sky
,
so
gayly
,
that
one
would
*NL*
have
said
that
they
had
just
been
set
at
liberty
.
Cosette
went
on
*NL*
attentively
tearing
the
leaves
from
her
flower
;
she
seemed
to
be
*NL*
thinking
about
something
;
but
whatever
it
was
,
it
must
be
something
*NL*
charming
;
all
at
once
she
turned
her
head
over
her
shoulder
with
the
*NL*
delicate
languor
of
a
swan
,
and
said
to
Jean
Valjean
:
``
Father
,
what
are
*NL*
the
galleys
like
?

CHAPTER

A
WOUND
WITHOUT
,
HEALING
WITHIN
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
their
life
clouded
over
by
degrees
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
one
diversion
,
which
had
formerly
been
a
happiness
,
remained
to
*NL*
them
,
which
was
to
carry
bread
to
those
who
were
hungry
,
and
clothing
*NL*
to
those
who
were
cold
.
Cosette
often
accompanied
Jean
Valjean
on
these
*NL*
visits
to
the
poor
,
on
which
they
recovered
some
remnants
of
their
*NL*
former
free
intercourse
;
and
sometimes
,
when
the
day
had
been
a
good
*NL*
one
,
and
they
had
assisted
many
in
distress
,
and
cheered
and
warmed
many
*NL*
little
children
,
Cosette
was
rather
merry
in
the
evening
.
It
was
at
this
*NL*
epoch
that
they
paid
their
visit
to
the
Jondrette
den
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
following
that
visit
,
Jean
Valjean
made
his
appearance
in
the
*NL*
pavilion
in
the
morning
,
calm
as
was
his
wont
,
but
with
a
large
wound
on
*NL*
his
left
arm
which
was
much
inflamed
,
and
very
angry
,
which
resembled
a
*NL*
burn
,
and
which
he
explained
in
some
way
or
other
.
This
wound
resulted
*NL*
in
his
being
detained
in
the
house
for
a
month
with
fever
.
He
would
not
*NL*
call
in
a
doctor
.
When
Cosette
urged
him
,
``
Call
the
dog-doctor
,
''
said
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
dressed
the
wound
morning
and
evening
with
so
divine
an
air
and
*NL*
such
angelic
happiness
at
being
of
use
to
him
,
that
Jean
Valjean
felt
*NL*
all
his
former
joy
returning
,
his
fears
and
anxieties
dissipating
,
and
*NL*
he
gazed
at
Cosette
,
saying
:
``
Oh
!
what
a
kindly
wound
!
Oh
!
what
a
good
*NL*
misfortune
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
on
perceiving
that
her
father
was
ill
,
had
deserted
the
pavilion
*NL*
and
again
taken
a
fancy
to
the
little
lodging
and
the
back
courtyard
.
*NL*
She
passed
nearly
all
her
days
beside
Jean
Valjean
and
read
to
him
*NL*
the
books
which
he
desired
.
Generally
they
were
books
of
travel
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
undergoing
a
new
birth
;
his
happiness
was
reviving
in
these
*NL*
ineffable
rays
;
the
Luxembourg
,
the
prowling
young
stranger
,
Cosette
's
*NL*
coldness
,
--
all
these
clouds
upon
his
soul
were
growing
dim
.
He
had
*NL*
reached
the
point
where
he
said
to
himself
:
``
I
imagined
all
that
.
I
am
*NL*
an
old
fool
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
happiness
was
so
great
that
the
horrible
discovery
of
the
*NL*
Thenardiers
made
in
the
Jondrette
hovel
,
unexpected
as
it
was
,
had
,
*NL*
after
a
fashion
,
glided
over
him
unnoticed
.
He
had
succeeded
in
making
*NL*
his
escape
;
all
trace
of
him
was
lost
--
what
more
did
he
care
for
!
he
*NL*
only
thought
of
those
wretched
beings
to
pity
them
.
``
Here
they
are
in
*NL*
prison
,
and
henceforth
they
will
be
incapacitated
for
doing
any
harm
,
''
*NL*
he
thought
,
``
but
what
a
lamentable
family
in
distress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
hideous
vision
of
the
Barriere
du
Maine
,
Cosette
had
not
*NL*
referred
to
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sister
Sainte-Mechtilde
had
taught
Cosette
music
in
the
convent
;
Cosette
*NL*
had
the
voice
of
a
linnet
with
a
soul
,
and
sometimes
,
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
in
the
wounded
man
's
humble
abode
,
she
warbled
melancholy
songs
which
*NL*
delighted
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
came
;
the
garden
was
so
delightful
at
that
season
of
the
year
,
*NL*
that
Jean
Valjean
said
to
Cosette
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
go
there
;
I
want
you
to
stroll
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like
,
father
,
''
said
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
the
sake
of
obeying
her
father
,
she
resumed
her
walks
in
the
*NL*
garden
,
generally
alone
,
for
,
as
we
have
mentioned
,
Jean
Valjean
,
who
*NL*
was
probably
afraid
of
being
seen
through
the
fence
,
hardly
ever
went
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
wound
had
created
a
diversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Cosette
saw
that
her
father
was
suffering
less
,
that
he
was
*NL*
convalescing
,
and
that
he
appeared
to
be
happy
,
she
experienced
a
*NL*
contentment
which
she
did
not
even
perceive
,
so
gently
and
naturally
*NL*
had
it
come
.
Then
,
it
was
in
the
month
of
March
,
the
days
were
growing
*NL*
longer
,
the
winter
was
departing
,
the
winter
always
bears
away
with
it
a
*NL*
portion
of
our
sadness
;
then
came
April
,
that
daybreak
of
summer
,
fresh
*NL*
as
dawn
always
is
,
gay
like
every
childhood
;
a
little
inclined
to
weep
*NL*
at
times
like
the
new-born
being
that
it
is
.
In
that
month
,
nature
*NL*
has
charming
gleams
which
pass
from
the
sky
,
from
the
trees
,
from
the
*NL*
meadows
and
the
flowers
into
the
heart
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
still
too
young
to
escape
the
penetrating
influence
of
that
*NL*
April
joy
which
bore
so
strong
a
resemblance
to
herself
.
Insensibly
,
and
*NL*
without
her
suspecting
the
fact
,
the
blackness
departed
from
her
spirit
.
*NL*
In
spring
,
sad
souls
grow
light
,
as
light
falls
into
cellars
at
midday
.
*NL*
Cosette
was
no
longer
sad
.
However
,
though
this
was
so
,
she
did
not
*NL*
account
for
it
to
herself
.
In
the
morning
,
about
ten
o'clock
,
after
*NL*
breakfast
,
when
she
had
succeeded
in
enticing
her
father
into
the
garden
*NL*
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
and
when
she
was
pacing
up
and
down
in
the
*NL*
sunlight
in
front
of
the
steps
,
supporting
his
left
arm
for
him
,
she
did
*NL*
not
perceive
that
she
laughed
every
moment
and
that
she
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
intoxicated
,
beheld
her
growing
fresh
and
rosy
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
What
a
good
wound
!
''
he
repeated
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
felt
grateful
to
the
Thenardiers
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
wound
once
healed
,
he
resumed
his
solitary
twilight
strolls
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
a
person
can
stroll
alone
in
that
*NL*
fashion
in
the
uninhabited
regions
of
Paris
without
meeting
with
some
*NL*
adventure
.

CHAPTER
II
--
MOTHER
PLUTARQUE
FINDS
NO
DIFFICULTY
IN
EXPLAINING
A
*NL*
PHENOMENON
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
little
Gavroche
had
had
nothing
to
eat
;
he
remembered
*NL*
that
he
had
not
dined
on
the
preceding
day
either
;
this
was
becoming
*NL*
tiresome
.
He
resolved
to
make
an
effort
to
secure
some
supper
.
He
*NL*
strolled
out
beyond
the
Salpetriere
into
deserted
regions
;
that
is
*NL*
where
windfalls
are
to
be
found
;
where
there
is
no
one
,
one
always
*NL*
finds
something
.
He
reached
a
settlement
which
appeared
to
him
to
be
the
*NL*
village
of
Austerlitz
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
of
his
preceding
lounges
he
had
noticed
there
an
old
garden
*NL*
haunted
by
an
old
man
and
an
old
woman
,
and
in
that
garden
,
a
passable
*NL*
apple-tree
.
Beside
the
apple-tree
stood
a
sort
of
fruit-house
,
which
was
*NL*
not
securely
fastened
,
and
where
one
might
contrive
to
get
an
apple
.
One
*NL*
apple
is
a
supper
;
one
apple
is
life
.
That
which
was
Adam
's
ruin
might
*NL*
prove
Gavroche
's
salvation
.
The
garden
abutted
on
a
solitary
,
unpaved
*NL*
lane
,
bordered
with
brushwood
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
houses
;
the
*NL*
garden
was
separated
from
it
by
a
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
directed
his
steps
towards
this
garden
;
he
found
the
lane
,
he
*NL*
recognized
the
apple-tree
,
he
verified
the
fruit-house
,
he
examined
the
*NL*
hedge
;
a
hedge
means
merely
one
stride
.
The
day
was
declining
,
there
was
*NL*
not
even
a
cat
in
the
lane
,
the
hour
was
propitious
.
Gavroche
began
*NL*
the
operation
of
scaling
the
hedge
,
then
suddenly
paused
.
Some
one
was
*NL*
talking
in
the
garden
.
Gavroche
peeped
through
one
of
the
breaks
in
the
*NL*
hedge
.
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
A
couple
of
paces
distant
,
at
the
foot
of
the
hedge
on
the
other
side
,
*NL*
exactly
at
the
point
where
the
gap
which
he
was
meditating
would
have
*NL*
been
made
,
there
was
a
sort
of
recumbent
stone
which
formed
a
bench
,
and
*NL*
on
this
bench
was
seated
the
old
man
of
the
garden
,
while
the
old
woman
*NL*
was
standing
in
front
of
him
.
The
old
woman
was
grumbling
.
Gavroche
,
who
*NL*
was
not
very
discreet
,
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Mabeuf
!
''
said
the
old
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mabeuf
!
''
thought
Gavroche
,
``
that
name
is
a
perfect
farce
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
who
was
thus
addressed
,
did
not
stir
.
The
old
woman
*NL*
repeated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Mabeuf
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
,
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
ground
,
made
up
his
mind
*NL*
to
answer
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
Mother
Plutarque
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
Plutarque
!
''
thought
Gavroche
,
``
another
farcical
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Plutarque
began
again
,
and
the
old
man
was
forced
to
accept
the
*NL*
conversation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
landlord
is
not
pleased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
owe
three
quarters
rent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
three
months
,
we
shall
owe
him
for
four
quarters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
that
he
will
turn
you
out
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will

The
old
woman
went
away
,
the
old
man
remained
alone
.
He
fell
into
*NL*
thought
.
Gavroche
became
thoughtful
also
.
It
was
almost
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
result
of
Gavroche
's
meditation
was
,
that
instead
of
scaling
*NL*
the
hedge
,
he
crouched
down
under
it
.
The
branches
stood
apart
a
little
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
thicket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
exclaimed
Gavroche
mentally
,
``
here
's
a
nook
!
''
and
he
curled
up
*NL*
in
it
.
His
back
was
almost
in
contact
with
Father
Mabeuf
's
bench
.
He
*NL*
could
hear
the
octogenarian
breathe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
by
way
of
dinner
,
he
tried
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cat-nap
,
with
one
eye
open
.
While
he
dozed
,
Gavroche
kept
on
*NL*
the
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twilight
pallor
of
the
sky
blanched
the
earth
,
and
the
lane
formed
a
*NL*
livid
line
between
two
rows
of
dark
bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
in
this
whitish
band
,
two
figures
made
their
appearance
.
*NL*
One
was
in
front
,
the
other
some
distance
in
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
come
two
creatures
,
''
muttered
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
form
seemed
to
be
some
elderly
bourgeois
,
who
was
bent
and
*NL*
thoughtful
,
dressed
more
than
plainly
,
and
who
was
walking
slowly
*NL*
because
of
his
age
,
and
strolling
about
in
the
open
evening
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
was
straight
,
firm
,
slender
.
It
regulated
its
pace
by
that
*NL*
of
the
first
;
but
in
the
voluntary
slowness
of
its
gait
,
suppleness
*NL*
and
agility
were
discernible
.
This
figure
had
also
something
fierce
and
*NL*
disquieting
about
it
,
the
whole
shape
was
that
of
what
was
then
called
*NL*
an
elegant
;
the
hat
was
of
good
shape
,
the
coat
black
,
well
cut
,
*NL*
probably
of
fine
cloth
,
and
well
fitted
in
at
the
waist
.
The
head
was
*NL*
held
erect
with
a
sort
of
robust
grace
,
and
beneath
the
hat
the
pale
*NL*
profile
of
a
young
man
could
be
made
out
in
the
dim
light
.
The
profile
*NL*
had
a
rose
in
its
mouth
.
This
second
form
was
well
known
to
Gavroche
;
it
*NL*
was
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
have
told
nothing
about
the
other
,
except
that
he
was
a
*NL*
respectable
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
immediately
began
to
take
observations
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
two
pedestrians
evidently
had
a
project
connected
with
*NL*
the
other
.
Gavroche
was
well
placed
to
watch
the
course
of
events
.
The
*NL*
bedroom
had
turned
into
a
hiding-place
at
a
very
opportune
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
on
the
hunt
at
such
an
hour
,
in
such
a
place
,
betokened
*NL*
something
threatening
.
Gavroche
felt
his
gamin
's
heart
moved
with
*NL*
compassion
for
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
?
Interfere
?
One
weakness
coming
to
the
aid
of
another
!
*NL*
It
would
be
merely
a
laughing
matter
for
Montparnasse
.
Gavroche
did
not
*NL*
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
the
old
man
,
in
the
first
place
,
and
the
*NL*
child
in
the
second
,
would
make
but
two
mouthfuls
for
that
redoubtable
*NL*
ruffian
eighteen
years
of
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Gavroche
was
deliberating
,
the
attack
took
place
,
abruptly
and
*NL*
hideously
.
The
attack
of
the
tiger
on
the
wild
ass
,
the
attack
of
the
*NL*
spider
on
the
fly
.
Montparnasse
suddenly
tossed
away
his
rose
,
bounded
*NL*
upon
the
old
man
,
seized
him
by
the
collar
,
grasped
and
clung
to
him
,
*NL*
and
Gavroche
with
difficulty
restrained
a
scream
.
A
moment
later
one
of
*NL*
these
men
was
underneath
the
other
,
groaning
,
struggling
,
with
a
knee
*NL*
of
marble
upon
his
breast
.
Only
,
it
was
not
just
what
Gavroche
had
*NL*
expected
.
The
one
who
lay
on
the
earth
was
Montparnasse
;
the
one
who
*NL*
was
on
top
was
the
old
man
.
All
this
took
place
a
few
paces
distant
from
*NL*
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
had
received
the
shock
,
had
returned
it
,
and
that
in
such
*NL*
a
terrible
fashion
,
that
in
a
twinkling
,
the
assailant
and
the
assailed
*NL*
had
exchanged
roles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
hearty
veteran
!
''
thought
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
refrain
from
clapping
his
hands
.
But
it
was
applause
*NL*
wasted
.
It
did
not
reach
the
combatants
,
absorbed
and
deafened
as
they
*NL*
were
,
each
by
the
other
,
as
their
breath
mingled
in
the
struggle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
ensued
.
Montparnasse
ceased
his
struggles
.
Gavroche
indulged
in
*NL*
this
aside
:
``
Can
he
be
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
goodman
had
not
uttered
a
word
,
nor
given
vent
to
a
cry
.
He
rose
to
*NL*
his
feet
,
and
Gavroche
heard
him
say
to
Montparnasse
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
rose
,
but
the
goodman
held
him
fast
.
Montparnasse
's
*NL*
attitude
was
the
humiliated
and
furious
attitude
of
the
wolf
who
has
*NL*
been
caught
by
a
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
looked
on
and
listened
,
making
an
effort
to
reinforce
his
eyes
*NL*
with
his
ears
.
He
was
enjoying
himself
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
repaid
for
his
conscientious
anxiety
in
the
character
of
a
*NL*
spectator
.
He
was
able
to
catch
on
the
wing
a
dialogue
which
borrowed
*NL*
from
the
darkness
an
indescribably
tragic
accent
.
The
goodman
*NL*
questioned
,
Montparnasse
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nineteen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
strong
and
healthy
.
Why
do
you
not
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
bores
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
your
trade
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
idler
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak
seriously
.
Can
anything
be
done
for
you
?
What
would
you
like
to
*NL*
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
thief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
ensued
.
The
old
man
seemed
absorbed
in
profound
thought
.
He
*NL*
stood
motionless
,
and
did
not
relax
his
hold
on
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
moment
the
vigorous
and
agile
young
ruffian
indulged
in
the
*NL*
twitchings
of
a
wild
beast
caught
in
a
snare
.
He
gave
a
jerk
,
tried
a
*NL*
crook
of
the
knee
,
twisted
his
limbs
desperately
,
and
made
efforts
to
*NL*
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
,
and
held
both
his
arms
with
one
*NL*
hand
,
with
the
sovereign
indifference
of
absolute
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
's
revery
lasted
for
some
time
,
then
,
looking
steadily
at
*NL*
Montparnasse
,
he
addressed
to
him
in
a
gentle
voice
,
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
darkness
where
they
stood
,
a
solemn
harangue
,
of
which
Gavroche
did
not
*NL*
lose
a
single
syllable
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
you
are
entering
,
through
indolence
,
on
one
of
the
most
*NL*
laborious
of
lives
.
Ah
!
You
declare
yourself
to
be
an
idler
!
prepare
to
*NL*
toil
.
There
is
a
certain
formidable
machine
,
have
you
seen
it
?
It
is
*NL*
the
rolling-mill
.
You
must
be
on
your
guard
against
it
,
it
is
crafty
*NL*
and
ferocious
;
if
it
catches
hold
of
the
skirt
of
your
coat
,
you
will
be
*NL*
drawn
in
bodily
.
That
machine
is
laziness
.
Stop
while
there
is
yet
time
,
*NL*
and
save
yourself
!
Otherwise
,
it
is
all
over
with
you
;
in
a
short
time
*NL*
you
will
be
among
the
gearing
.
Once
entangled
,
hope
for
nothing
more
.
*NL*
Toil
,
lazybones
!
there
is
no
more
repose
for
you
!
The
iron
hand
of
*NL*
implacable
toil
has
seized
you
.
You
do
not
wish
to
earn
your
living
,
to
*NL*
have
a
task
,
to
fulfil
a
duty
!
It
bores
you
to
be
like
other
men
?
Well
!
*NL*
You
will
be
different
.
Labor
is
the
law
;
he
who
rejects
it
will
find
*NL*
ennui
his
torment
.
You
do
not
wish
to
be
a
workingman
,
you
will
be
a
*NL*
slave
.
Toil
lets
go
of
you
on
one
side
only
to
grasp
you
again
on
the
*NL*
other
.
You
do
not
desire
to
be
its
friend
,
you
shall
be
its
negro
slave
.
*NL*
Ah
!
You
would
have
none
of
the
honest
weariness
of
men
,
you
shall
have
*NL*
the
sweat
of
the
damned
.
Where
others
sing
,
you
will
rattle
in
your
*NL*
throat
.
You
will
see
afar
off
,
from
below
,
other
men
at
work
;
it
will
*NL*
seem
to
you
that
they
are
resting
.
The
laborer
,
the
harvester
,
the
*NL*
sailor
,
the
blacksmith
,
will
appear
to
you
in
glory
like
the
blessed
*NL*
spirits
in
paradise
.
What
radiance
surrounds
the
forge
!
To
guide
the
*NL*
plough
,
to
bind
the
sheaves
,
is
joy
.
The
bark
at
liberty
in
the
wind
,
*NL*
what
delight
!
Do
you
,
lazy
idler
,
delve
,
drag
on
,
roll
,
march
!
Drag
your
*NL*
halter
.
You
are
a
beast
of
burden
in
the
team
of
hell
!
Ah
!
To
do
nothing
*NL*
is
your
object
.
Well
,
not
a
week
,
not
a
day
,
not
an
hour
shall
you
have
*NL*
free
from
oppression
.
You
will
be
able
to
lift
nothing
without
anguish
.
*NL*
Every
minute
that
passes
will
make
your
muscles
crack
.
What
is
a
feather
*NL*
to
others
will
be
a
rock
to
you
.
The
simplest
things
will
become
steep
*NL*
acclivities
.
Life
will
become
monstrous
all
about
you
.
To
go
,
to
come
,
*NL*
to
breathe
,
will
be
just
so
many
terrible
labors
.
Your
lungs
will
*NL*
produce
on
you
the
effect
of
weighing
a
hundred
pounds
.
Whether
you
*NL*
shall
walk
here
rather
than
there
,
will
become
a
problem
that
must
be
*NL*
solved
.
Any
one
who
wants
to
go
out
simply
gives
his
door
a
push
,
and
*NL*
there
he
is
in
the
open
air
.
If
you
wish
to
go
out
,
you
will
be
obliged
*NL*
to
pierce
your
wall
.
What
does
every
one
who
wants
to
step
into
the
*NL*
street
do
?
He
goes
down
stairs
;
you
will
tear
up
your
sheets
,
little
*NL*
by
little
you
will
make
of
them
a
rope
,
then
you
will
climb
out
of
your
*NL*
window
,
and
you
will
suspend
yourself
by
that
thread
over
an
abyss
,
and
*NL*
it
will
be
night
,
amid
storm
,
rain
,
and
the
hurricane
,
and
if
the
rope
*NL*
is
too
short
,
but
one
way
of
descending
will
remain
to
you
,
to
fall
.
To
*NL*
drop
hap-hazard
into
the
gulf
,
from
an
unknown
height
,
on
what
?
On
what
*NL*
is
beneath
,
on
the
unknown
.
Or
you
will
crawl
up
a
chimney-flue
,
at
the
*NL*
risk
of
burning
;
or
you
will
creep
through
a
sewer-pipe
,
at
the
risk
of
*NL*
drowning
;
I
do
not
speak
of
the
holes
that
you
will
be
obliged
to
mask
,
*NL*
of
the
stones
which
you
will
have
to
take
up
and
replace
twenty
times
a
*NL*
day
,
of
the
plaster
that
you
will
have
to
hide
in
your
straw
pallet
.
A
*NL*
lock
presents
itself
;
the
bourgeois
has
in
his
pocket
a
key
made
by
a
*NL*
locksmith
.
If
you
wish
to
pass
out
,
you
will
be
condemned
to
execute
a
*NL*
terrible
work
of
art
;
you
will
take
a
large
sou
,
you
will
cut
it
in
*NL*
two
plates
;
with
what
tools
?
You
will
have
to
invent
them
.
That
is
your
*NL*
business
.
Then
you
will
hollow
out
the
interior
of
these
plates
,
taking
*NL*
great
care
of
the
outside
,
and
you
will
make
on
the
edges
a
thread
,
so
*NL*
that
they
can
be
adjusted
one
upon
the
other
like
a
box
and
its
cover
.
*NL*
The
top
and
bottom
thus
screwed
together
,
nothing
will
be
suspected
.
To
*NL*
the
overseers
it
will
be
only
a
sou
;
to
you
it
will
be
a
box
.
What
will
*NL*
you
put
in
this
box
?
A
small
bit
of
steel
.
A
watch-spring
,
in
which
you
*NL*
will
have
cut
teeth
,
and
which
will
form
a
saw
.
With
this
saw
,
as
long
*NL*
as
a
pin
,
and
concealed
in
a
sou
,
you
will
cut
the
bolt
of
the
lock
,
you
*NL*
will
sever
bolts
,
the
padlock
of
your
chain
,
and
the
bar
at
your
window
,
*NL*
and
the
fetter
on
your
leg
.
This
masterpiece
finished
,
this
prodigy
*NL*
accomplished
,
all
these
miracles
of
art
,
address
,
skill
,
and
patience
*NL*
executed
,
what
will
be
your
recompense
if
it
becomes
known
that
you
*NL*
are
the
author
?
The
dungeon
.
There
is
your
future
.
What
precipices
are
*NL*
idleness
and
pleasure
!
Do
you
know
that
to
do
nothing
is
a
melancholy
*NL*
resolution
?
To
live
in
idleness
on
the
property
of
society
!
to
be
*NL*
useless
,
that
is
to
say
,
pernicious
!
This
leads
straight
to
the
depth
*NL*
of
wretchedness
.
Woe
to
the
man
who
desires
to
be
a
parasite
!
He
will
*NL*
become
vermin
!
Ah
!
So
it
does
not
please
you
to
work
?
Ah
!
You
have
but
*NL*
one
thought
,
to
drink
well
,
to
eat
well
,
to
sleep
well
.
You
will
drink
*NL*
water
,
you
will
eat
black
bread
,
you
will
sleep
on
a
plank
with
a
fetter
*NL*
whose
cold
touch
you
will
feel
on
your
flesh
all
night
long
,
riveted
to
*NL*
your
limbs
.
You
will
break
those
fetters
,
you
will
flee
.
That
is
well
.
*NL*
You
will
crawl
on
your
belly
through
the
brushwood
,
and
you
will
eat
*NL*
grass
like
the
beasts
of
the
forest
.
And
you
will
be
recaptured
.
And
*NL*
then
you
will
pass
years
in
a
dungeon
,
riveted
to
a
wall
,
groping
for
*NL*
your
jug
that
you
may
drink
,
gnawing
at
a
horrible
loaf
of
darkness
*NL*
which
dogs
would
not
touch
,
eating
beans
that
the
worms
have
eaten
*NL*
before
you
.
You
will
be
a
wood-louse
in
a
cellar
.
Ah
!
Have
pity
on
*NL*
yourself
,
you
miserable
young
child
,
who
were
sucking
at
nurse
less
*NL*
than
twenty
years
ago
,
and
who
have
,
no
doubt
,
a
mother
still
alive
!
I
*NL*
conjure
you
,
listen
to
me
,
I
entreat
you
.
You
desire
fine
black
cloth
,
*NL*
varnished
shoes
,
to
have
your
hair
curled
and
sweet-smelling
oils
on
*NL*
your
locks
,
to
please
low
women
,
to
be
handsome
.
You
will
be
shaven
*NL*
clean
,
and
you
will
wear
a
red
blouse
and
wooden
shoes
.
You
want
rings
*NL*
on
your
fingers
,
you
will
have
an
iron
necklet
on
your
neck
.
If
you
*NL*
glance
at
a
woman
,
you
will
receive
a
blow
.
And
you
will
enter
there
at
*NL*
the
age
of
twenty
.
And
you
will
come
out
at
fifty
!
You
will
enter
young
,
*NL*
rosy
,
fresh
,
with
brilliant
eyes
,
and
all
your
white
teeth
,
and
your
*NL*
handsome
,
youthful
hair
;
you
will
come
out
broken
,
bent
,
wrinkled
,
*NL*
toothless
,
horrible
,
with
white
locks
!
Ah
!
my
poor
child
,
you
are
on
the
*NL*
wrong
road
;
idleness
is
counselling
you
badly
;
the
hardest
of
all
work
*NL*
is
thieving
.
Believe
me
,
do
not
undertake
that
painful
profession
of
*NL*
an
idle
man
.
It
is
not
comfortable
to
become
a
rascal
.
It
is
less
*NL*
disagreeable
to
be
an
honest
man
.
Now
go
,
and
ponder
on
what
I
have
said
*NL*
to
you
.
By
the
way
,
what
did
you
want
of
me
?
My
purse
?
Here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
old
man
,
releasing
Montparnasse
,
put
his
purse
in
the
latter
's
*NL*
hand
;
Montparnasse
weighed
it
for
a
moment
,
after
which
he
allowed
it
to
*NL*
slide
gently
into
the
back
pocket
of
his
coat
,
with
the
same
mechanical
*NL*
precaution
as
though
he
had
stolen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
having
been
said
and
done
,
the
goodman
turned
his
back
and
*NL*
tranquilly
resumed
his
stroll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
blockhead
!
''
muttered
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
this
goodman
?
The
reader
has
,
no
doubt
,
already
divined
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
watched
him
with
amazement
,
as
he
disappeared
in
the
dusk
.
*NL*
This
contemplation
was
fatal
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
old
man
was
walking
away
,
Gavroche
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
had
assured
himself
,
with
a
sidelong
glance
,
that
Father
Mabeuf
*NL*
was
still
sitting
on
his
bench
,
probably
sound
asleep
.
Then
the
gamin
*NL*
emerged
from
his
thicket
,
and
began
to
crawl
after
Montparnasse
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
as
the
latter
stood
there
motionless
.
In
this
manner
he
came
up
*NL*
to
Montparnasse
without
being
seen
or
heard
,
gently
insinuated
his
hand
*NL*
into
the
back
pocket
of
that
frock-coat
of
fine
black
cloth
,
seized
the
*NL*
purse
,
withdrew
his
hand
,
and
having
recourse
once
more
to
his
crawling
,
*NL*
he
slipped
away
like
an
adder
through
the
shadows
.
Montparnasse
,
who
*NL*
had
no
reason
to
be
on
his
guard
,
and
who
was
engaged
in
thought
for
the
*NL*
first
time
in
his
life
,
perceived
nothing
.
When
Gavroche
had
once
more
*NL*
attained
the
point
where
Father
Mabeuf
was
,
he
flung
the
purse
over
the
*NL*
hedge
,
and
fled
as
fast
as
his
legs
would
carry
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
purse
fell
on
Father
Mabeuf
's
foot
.
This
commotion
roused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
over
and
picked
up
the
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
understand
in
the
least
,
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
purse
had
two
compartments
;
in
one
of
them
there
was
some
small
*NL*
change
;
in
the
other
lay
six
napoleons
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
,
in
great
alarm
,
referred
the
matter
to
his
housekeeper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
has
fallen
from
heaven

CHAPTER

SOLITUDE
AND
THE
BARRACKS
COMBINED
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
's
grief
,
which
had
been
so
poignant
and
lively
four
or
five
*NL*
months
previously
,
had
,
without
her
being
conscious
of
the
fact
,
entered
*NL*
upon
its
convalescence
.
Nature
,
spring
,
youth
,
love
for
her
father
,
*NL*
the
gayety
of
the
birds
and
flowers
,
caused
something
almost
resembling
*NL*
forgetfulness
to
filter
gradually
,
drop
by
drop
,
into
that
soul
,
which
*NL*
was
so
virgin
and
so
young
.
Was
the
fire
wholly
extinct
there
?
Or
was
*NL*
it
merely
that
layers
of
ashes
had
formed
?
The
truth
is
,
that
she
hardly
*NL*
felt
the
painful
and
burning
spot
any
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
suddenly
thought
of
Marius
:
``
Why
!
''
said
she
,
``
I
no
longer
*NL*
think
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
week
,
she
noticed
a
very
handsome
officer
of
lancers
,
with
*NL*
a
wasp-like
waist
,
a
delicious
uniform
,
the
cheeks
of
a
young
girl
,
a
*NL*
sword
under
his
arm
,
waxed
mustaches
,
and
a
glazed
schapka
,
passing
the
*NL*
gate
.
Moreover
,
he
had
light
hair
,
prominent
blue
eyes
,
a
round
face
,
*NL*
was
vain
,
insolent
and
good-looking
;
quite
the
reverse
of
Marius
.
He
*NL*
had
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
.
Cosette
thought
that
this
officer
doubtless
*NL*
belonged
to
the
regiment
in
barracks
in
the
Rue
de
Babylone
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
she
saw
him
pass
again
.
She
took
note
of
the
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
time
forth
,
was
it
chance
?
she
saw
him
pass
nearly
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
's
comrades
perceived
that
there
was
,
in
that
``
badly
kept
''
*NL*
garden
,
behind
that
malicious
rococo
fence
,
a
very
pretty
creature
,
*NL*
who
was
almost
always
there
when
the
handsome
lieutenant
,
--
who
is
not
*NL*
unknown
to
the
reader
,
and
whose
name
was
Theodule
Gillenormand
,
--
passed
*NL*
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
!
''
they
said
to
him
,
``
there
's
a
little
creature
there
who
is
*NL*
making
eyes
at
you
,
look
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
the
time
,
''
replied
the
lancer
,
``
to
look
at
all
the
girls
who
*NL*
look
at
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
at
the
precise
moment
when
Marius
was
descending
heavily
*NL*
towards
agony
,
and
was
saying
:
``
If
I
could
but
see
her
before
I
*NL*
die
!
''
--
Had
his
wish
been
realized
,
had
he
beheld
Cosette
at
that
moment
*NL*
gazing
at
the
lancer
,
he
would
not
have
been
able
to
utter
a
word
,
and
*NL*
he
would
have
expired
with
grief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whose
fault
was
it
?
No
one
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
possessed
one
of
those
temperaments
which
bury
themselves
in
*NL*
sorrow
and
there
abide
;
Cosette
was
one
of
those
persons
who
plunge
into
*NL*
sorrow
and
emerge
from
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
,
moreover
,
passing
through
that
dangerous
period
,
the
fatal
*NL*
phase
of
feminine
revery
abandoned
to
itself
,
in
which
the
isolated
*NL*
heart
of
a
young
girl
resembles
the
tendrils
of
the
vine
which
cling
,
*NL*
as
chance
directs
,
to
the
capital
of
a
marble
column
or
to
the
post
of
*NL*
a
wine-shop
:
A
rapid
and
decisive
moment
,
critical
for
every
orphan
,
be
*NL*
she
rich
or
poor
,
for
wealth
does
not
prevent
a
bad
choice
;
misalliances
*NL*
are
made
in
very
high
circles
,
real
misalliance
is
that
of
souls
;
and
as
*NL*
many
an
unknown
young
man
,
without
name
,
without
birth
,
without
fortune
,
*NL*
is
a
marble
column
which
bears
up
a
temple
of
grand
sentiments
and
grand
*NL*
ideas
,
so
such
and
such
a
man
of
the
world
satisfied
and
opulent
,
who
*NL*
has
polished
boots
and
varnished
words
,
if
looked
at
not
outside
,
but
*NL*
inside
,
a
thing
which
is
reserved
for
his
wife
,
is
nothing
more
than
a
*NL*
block
obscurely
haunted
by
violent
,
unclean
,
and
vinous
passions
;
the
*NL*
post
of
a
drinking-shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
Cosette
's
soul
contain
?
Passion
calmed
or
lulled
to
sleep
;
*NL*
something
limpid
,
brilliant
,
troubled
to
a
certain
depth
,
and
gloomy
*NL*
lower
down
.
The
image
of
the
handsome
officer
was
reflected
in
*NL*
the
surface
.
Did
a
souvenir
linger
in
the
depths
?
--
Quite
at
the
*NL*
bottom
?
--
Possibly
.
Cosette
did
not
know

CHAPTER
II
--
COSETTE
'S
APPREHENSIONS
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
first
fortnight
in
April
,
Jean
Valjean
took
a
journey
.
This
,
*NL*
as
the
reader
knows
,
happened
from
time
to
time
,
at
very
long
intervals
.
*NL*
He
remained
absent
a
day
or
two
days
at
the
utmost
.
Where
did
he
go
?
No
*NL*
one
knew
,
not
even
Cosette
.
Once
only
,
on
the
occasion
of
one
of
these
*NL*
departures
,
she
had
accompanied
him
in
a
hackney-coach
as
far
as
a
*NL*
little
blind-alley
at
the
corner
of
which
she
read
:
Impasse
de
la
*NL*
Planchette
.
There
he
alighted
,
and
the
coach
took
Cosette
back
to
the
*NL*
Rue
de
Babylone
.
It
was
usually
when
money
was
lacking
in
the
house
that
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
took
these
little
trips
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Jean
Valjean
was
absent
.
He
had
said
:
``
I
shall
return
in
three
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
Cosette
was
alone
in
the
drawing-room
.
In
order
to
get
*NL*
rid
of
her
ennui
,
she
had
opened
her
piano-organ
,
and
had
begun
to
sing
,
*NL*
accompanying
herself
the
while
,
the
chorus
from
Euryanthe
:
``
Hunters
*NL*
astray
in
the
wood
!
''
which
is
probably
the
most
beautiful
thing
in
all
*NL*
the
sphere
of
music
.
When
she
had
finished
,
she
remained
wrapped
in
*NL*
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
*NL*
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
could
not
be
her
father
,
he
was
absent
;
it
could
not
be
Toussaint
,
*NL*
she
was
in
bed
,
and
it
was
ten
o'clock
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stepped
to
the
shutter
of
the
drawing-room
,
which
was
closed
,
and
*NL*
laid
her
ear
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
her
that
it
was
the
tread
of
a
man
,
and
that
he
was
walking
*NL*
very
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
mounted
rapidly
to
the
first
floor
,
to
her
own
chamber
,
opened
a
*NL*
small
wicket
in
her
shutter
,
and
peeped
into
the
garden
.
The
moon
was
at
*NL*
the
full
.
Everything
could
be
seen
as
plainly
as
by
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
the
window
.
The
garden
was
absolutely
calm
,
and
all
that
was
*NL*
visible
was
that
the
street
was
deserted
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
thought
that
she
had
been
mistaken
.
She
thought
that
she
had
*NL*
heard
a
noise
.
It
was
a
hallucination
produced
by
the
melancholy
and
*NL*
magnificent
chorus
of
Weber
,
which
lays
open
before
the
mind
terrified
*NL*
depths
,
which
trembles
before
the
gaze
like
a
dizzy
forest
,
and
in
which
*NL*
one
hears
the
crackling
of
dead
branches
beneath
the
uneasy
tread
of
the
*NL*
huntsmen
of
whom
one
catches
a
glimpse
through
the
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
no
more
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Cosette
was
not
very
timid
by
nature
.
There
flowed
in
her
*NL*
veins
some
of
the
blood
of
the
bohemian
and
the
adventuress
who
runs
*NL*
barefoot
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
she
was
more
of
a
lark
than
a
dove
.
*NL*
There
was
a
foundation
of
wildness
and
bravery
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
at
an
earlier
hour
,
towards
nightfall
,
she
was
*NL*
strolling
in
the
garden
.
In
the
midst
of
the
confused
thoughts
which
*NL*
occupied
her
,
she
fancied
that
she
caught
for
an
instant
a
sound
similar
*NL*
to
that
of
the
preceding
evening
,
as
though
some
one
were
walking
*NL*
beneath
the
trees
in
the
dusk
,
and
not
very
far
from
her
;
but
she
told
*NL*
herself
that
nothing
so
closely
resembles
a
step
on
the
grass
as
the
*NL*
friction
of
two
branches
which
have
moved
from
side
to
side
,
and
she
*NL*
paid
no
heed
to
it
.
Besides
,
she
could
see
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
emerged
from
``
the
thicket
''
;
she
had
still
to
cross
a
small
lawn
to
*NL*
regain
the
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
,
which
had
just
risen
behind
her
,
cast
Cosette
's
shadow
in
*NL*
front
of
her
upon
this
lawn
,
as
she
came
out
from
the
shrubbery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
halted
in
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
her
shadow
,
the
moon
outlined
distinctly
upon
the
turf
another
*NL*
shadow
,
which
was
particularly
startling
and
terrible
,
a
shadow
which
*NL*
had
a
round
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
shadow
of
a
man
,
who
must
have
been
standing
on
the
border
of
*NL*
the
clump
of
shrubbery
,
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
of
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
for
a
moment
without
the
power
to
speak
,
or
cry
,
or
call
,
or
*NL*
stir
,
or
turn
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
summoned
up
all
her
courage
,
and
turned
round
resolutely
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
on
the
ground
.
The
figure
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
re-entered
the
thicket
,
searched
the
corners
boldly
,
went
as
far
as
*NL*
the
gate
,
and
found
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
herself
absolutely
chilled
with
terror
.
Was
this
another
*NL*
hallucination
?
What
!
Two
days
in
succession
!
One
hallucination
might
*NL*
pass
,
but
two
hallucinations
?
The
disquieting
point
about
it
was
,
that
*NL*
the
shadow
had
assuredly
not
been
a
phantom
.
Phantoms
do
not
wear
round
*NL*
hats
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
Jean
Valjean
returned
.
Cosette
told
him
what
she
*NL*
thought
she
had
heard
and
seen
.
She
wanted
to
be
reassured
and
to
see
*NL*
her
father
shrug
his
shoulders
and
say
to
her
:
``
You
are
a
little
goose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
grew
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
not
be
anything
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
her
under
some
pretext
,
and
went
into
the
garden
,
and
she
saw
*NL*
him
examining
the
gate
with
great
attention
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
night
she
woke
up
;
this
time
she
was
sure
,
and
she
distinctly
*NL*
heard
some
one
walking
close
to
the
flight
of
steps
beneath
her
window
.
*NL*
She
ran
to
her
little
wicket
and
opened
it
.
In
point
of
fact
,
there
*NL*
was
a
man
in
the
garden
,
with
a
large
club
in
his
hand
.
Just
as
she
*NL*
was
about
to
scream
,
the
moon
lighted
up
the
man
's
profile
.
It
was
her
*NL*
father
.
She
returned
to
her
bed
,
saying
to
herself
:
``
He
is
very
uneasy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
passed
that
night
and
the
two
succeeding
nights
in
the
*NL*
garden
.
Cosette
saw
him
through
the
hole
in
her
shutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
third
night
,
the
moon
was
on
the
wane
,
and
had
begun
to
rise
*NL*
later
;
at
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
possibly
,
she
heard
a
loud
burst
*NL*
of
laughter
and
her
father
's
voice
calling
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
jumped
out
of
bed
,
threw
on
her
dressing-gown
,
and
opened
her
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
was
standing
on
the
grass-plot
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
waked
you
for
the
purpose
of
reassuring
you
,
''
said
he
;
``
look
,
*NL*
there
is
your
shadow
with
the
round
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pointed
out
to
her
on
the
turf
a
shadow
cast
by
the
moon
,
and
*NL*
which
did
indeed
,
bear
considerable
resemblance
to
the
spectre
of
a
man
*NL*
wearing
a
round
hat
.
It
was
the
shadow
produced
by
a
chimney-pipe
of
*NL*
sheet
iron
,
with
a
hood
,
which
rose
above
a
neighboring
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
joined
in
his
laughter
,
all
her
lugubrious
suppositions
were
*NL*
allayed
,
and
the
next
morning
,
as
she
was
at
breakfast
with
her
father
,
*NL*
she
made
merry
over
the
sinister
garden
haunted
by
the
shadows
of
iron
*NL*
chimney-pots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
became
quite
tranquil
once
more
;
as
for
Cosette
,
she
did
*NL*
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
question
whether
the
chimney-pot
was
*NL*
really
in
the
direction
of
the
shadow
which
she
had
seen
,
or
thought
she
*NL*
had
seen
,
and
whether
the
moon
had
been
in
the
same
spot
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
question
herself
as
to
the
peculiarity
of
a
chimney-pot
*NL*
which
is
afraid
of
being
caught
in
the
act
,
and
which
retires
when
some
*NL*
one
looks
at
its
shadow
,
for
the
shadow
had
taken
the
alarm
when
Cosette
*NL*
had
turned
round
,
and
Cosette
had
thought
herself
very
sure
of
this
.
*NL*
Cosette
's
serenity
was
fully
restored
.
The
proof
appeared
to
her
to
*NL*
be
complete
,
and
it
quite
vanished
from
her
mind
,
whether
there
could
*NL*
possibly
be
any
one
walking
in
the
garden
during
the
evening
or
at
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
later
,
however
,
a
fresh
incident
occurred
.

CHAPTER
III
--
ENRICHED
WITH
COMMENTARIES
BY
TOUSSAINT
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
garden
,
near
the
railing
on
the
street
,
there
was
a
stone
bench
,
*NL*
screened
from
the
eyes
of
the
curious
by
a
plantation
of
yoke-elms
,
*NL*
but
which
could
,
in
case
of
necessity
,
be
reached
by
an
arm
from
the
*NL*
outside
,
past
the
trees
and
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
during
that
same
month
of
April
,
Jean
Valjean
had
gone
out
;
*NL*
Cosette
had
seated
herself
on
this
bench
after
sundown
.
The
breeze
was
*NL*
blowing
briskly
in
the
trees
,
Cosette
was
meditating
;
an
objectless
*NL*
sadness
was
taking
possession
of
her
little
by
little
,
that
invincible
*NL*
sadness
evoked
by
the
evening
,
and
which
arises
,
perhaps
,
who
knows
,
*NL*
from
the
mystery
of
the
tomb
which
is
ajar
at
that
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
Fantine
was
within
that
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
rose
,
slowly
made
the
tour
of
the
garden
,
walking
on
the
*NL*
grass
drenched
in
dew
,
and
saying
to
herself
,
through
the
species
of
*NL*
melancholy
somnambulism
in
which
she
was
plunged
:
``
Really
,
one
needs
*NL*
wooden
shoes
for
the
garden
at
this
hour
.
One
takes
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
to
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
about
to
resume
her
seat
there
,
she
observed
on
the
spot
*NL*
which
she
had
quitted
,
a
tolerably
large
stone
which
had
,
evidently
,
not
*NL*
been
there
a
moment
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
gazed
at
the
stone
,
asking
herself
what
it
meant
.
All
at
once
*NL*
the
idea
occurred
to
her
that
the
stone
had
not
reached
the
bench
all
by
*NL*
itself
,
that
some
one
had
placed
it
there
,
that
an
arm
had
been
thrust
*NL*
through
the
railing
,
and
this
idea
appeared
to
alarm
her
.
This
time
,
the
*NL*
fear
was
genuine
;
the
stone
was
there
.
No
doubt
was
possible
;
she
did
*NL*
not
touch
it
,
fled
without
glancing
behind
her
,
took
refuge
in
the
*NL*
house
,
and
immediately
closed
with
shutter
,
bolt
,
and
bar
the
door-like
*NL*
window
opening
on
the
flight
of
steps
.
She
inquired
of
Toussaint
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
my
father
returned
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
,
Mademoiselle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
We
have
already
noted
once
for
all
the
fact
that
Toussaint
stuttered
.
*NL*
May
we
be
permitted
to
dispense
with
it
for
the
future
.
The
musical
*NL*
notation
of
an
infirmity
is
repugnant
to
us
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
a
thoughtful
man
,
and
given
to
nocturnal
strolls
,
often
*NL*
returned
quite
late
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Toussaint
,
''
went
on
Cosette
,
``
are
you
careful
to
thoroughly
barricade
*NL*
the
shutters
opening
on
the
garden
,
at
least
with
bars
,
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
and
to
put
the
little
iron
things
in
the
little
rings
that
close
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
be
easy
on
that
score
,
Miss.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Toussaint
did
not
fail
in
her
duty
,
and
Cosette
was
well
aware
of
the
*NL*
fact
,
but
she
could
not
refrain
from
adding
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
solitary
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
that
is
concerned
,
''
said
Toussaint
,
``
it
is
true
.
We
might
be
*NL*
assassinated
before
we
had
time
to
say
ouf
!
And
Monsieur
does
not
sleep
*NL*
in
the
house
,
to
boot
.
But
fear
nothing
,
Miss
,
I
fasten
the
shutters
up
*NL*
like
prisons
.
Lone
women
!
That
is
enough
to
make
one
shudder
,
I
believe
*NL*
you
!
Just
imagine
,
what
if
you
were
to
see
men
enter
your
chamber
at
*NL*
night
and
say
:
`
Hold
your
tongue
!
'
and
begin
to
cut
your
throat
.
It
's
*NL*
not
the
dying
so
much
;
you
die
,
for
one
must
die
,
and
that
's
all
right
;
*NL*
it
's
the
abomination
of
feeling
those
people
touch
you
.
And
then
,
their
*NL*
knives
;
they
ca
n't
be
able
to
cut
well
with
them
!
Ah
,
good
gracious
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
,
''
said
Cosette
.
``
Fasten
everything
thoroughly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
terrified
by
the
melodrama
improvised
by
Toussaint
,
and
*NL*
possibly
,
also
,
by
the
recollection
of
the
apparitions
of
the
past
week
,
*NL*
which
recurred
to
her
memory
,
dared
not
even
say
to
her
:
``
Go
and
look
at
*NL*
the
stone
which
has
been
placed
on
the
bench
!
''
for
fear
of
opening
the
*NL*
garden
gate
and
allowing
``
the
men
''
to
enter
.
She
saw
that
all
the
doors
*NL*
and
windows
were
carefully
fastened
,
made
Toussaint
go
all
over
the
*NL*
house
from
garret
to
cellar
,
locked
herself
up
in
her
own
chamber
,
*NL*
bolted
her
door
,
looked
under
her
couch
,
went
to
bed
and
slept
badly
.
*NL*
All
night
long
she
saw
that
big
stone
,
as
large
as
a
mountain
and
full
*NL*
of
caverns
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
sunrise
,
--
the
property
of
the
rising
sun
is
to
make
us
laugh
at
all
*NL*
our
terrors
of
the
past
night
,
and
our
laughter
is
in
direct
proportion
*NL*
to
our
terror
which
they
have
caused
,
--
at
sunrise
Cosette
,
when
she
*NL*
woke
,
viewed
her
fright
as
a
nightmare
,
and
said
to
herself
:
``
What
have
*NL*
I
been
thinking
of
?
It
is
like
the
footsteps
that
I
thought
I
heard
a
*NL*
week
or
two
ago
in
the
garden
at
night
!
It
is
like
the
shadow
of
the
*NL*
chimney-pot
!
Am
I
becoming
a
coward
?
''
The
sun
,
which
was
glowing
through
*NL*
the
crevices
in
her
shutters
,
and
turning
the
damask
curtains
crimson
,
*NL*
reassured
her
to
such
an
extent
that
everything
vanished
from
her
*NL*
thoughts
,
even
the
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
more
a
stone
on
the
bench
than
there
was
a
man
in
a
round
*NL*
hat
in
the
garden
;
I
dreamed
about
the
stone
,
as
I
did
all
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
dressed
herself
,
descended
to
the
garden
,
ran
to
the
bench
,
and
*NL*
broke
out
in
a
cold
perspiration
.
The
stone
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
lasted
only
for
a
moment
.
That
which
is
terror
by
night
is
*NL*
curiosity
by
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah
!
''
said
she
,
``
come
,
let
us
see
what
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
the
stone
,
which
was
tolerably
large
.
Beneath
it
was
*NL*
something
which
resembled
a
letter
.
It
was
a
white
envelope
.
Cosette
*NL*
seized
it
.
There
was
no
address
on
one
side
,
no
seal
on
the
other
.
*NL*
Yet
the
envelope
,
though
unsealed
,
was
not
empty
.
Papers
could
be
seen
*NL*
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
examined
it
.
It
was
no
longer
alarm
,
it
was
no
longer
curiosity
;
*NL*
it
was
a
beginning
of
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
drew
from
the
envelope
its
contents
,
a
little
notebook
of
paper
,
*NL*
each
page
of
which
was
numbered
and
bore
a
few
lines
in
a
very
fine
and
*NL*
rather
pretty
handwriting
,
as
Cosette
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
looked
for
a
name
;
there
was
none
.
To
whom
was
this
addressed
?
*NL*
To
her
,
probably
,
since
a
hand
had
deposited
the
packet
on
her
bench
.
*NL*
From
whom
did
it
come
?
An
irresistible
fascination
took
possession
*NL*
of
her
;
she
tried
to
turn
away
her
eyes
from
the
leaflets
which
were
*NL*
trembling
in
her
hand
,
she
gazed
at
the
sky
,
the
street
,
the
acacias
*NL*
all
bathed
in
light
,
the
pigeons
fluttering
over
a
neighboring
roof
,
*NL*
and
then
her
glance
suddenly
fell
upon
the
manuscript
,
and
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
that
she
must
know
what
it
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
she
read
.

The

the
expansion

a

single

*NL*
Love

How

What

Oh

sufficient
to
cause
the
soul
to
enter
into
the
palace
of
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
God
is
behind
everything
,
but
everything
hides
God
.
Things
are
*NL*
black
,
creatures
are
opaque
.
To
love
a
being
is
to
render
that
being
*NL*
transparent
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
thoughts
are
prayers
.
There
are
moments
when
,
whatever
the
*NL*
attitude
of
the
body
may
be
,
the
soul
is
on
its
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Parted
lovers
beguile
absence
by
a
thousand
chimerical
devices
,
which
*NL*
possess
,
however
,
a
reality
of
their
own
.
They
are
prevented
from
seeing
*NL*
each
other
,
they
can
not
write
to
each
other
;
they
discover
a
multitude
*NL*
of
mysterious
means
to
correspond
.
They
send
each
other
the
song
of
the
*NL*
birds
,
the
perfume
of
the
flowers
,
the
smiles
of
children
,
the
light
of
*NL*
the
sun
,
the
sighings
of
the
breeze
,
the
rays
of
stars
,
all
creation
.
*NL*
And
why
not
?
All
the
works
of
God
are
made
to
serve
love
.
Love
is
*NL*
sufficiently
potent
to
charge
all
nature
with
its
messages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
Spring
!
Thou
art
a
letter
that
I
write
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
future
belongs
to
hearts
even
more
than
it
does
to
minds
.
Love
,
that
*NL*
is
the
only
thing
that
can
occupy
and
fill
eternity
.
In
the
infinite
,
*NL*
the
inexhaustible
is
requisite
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Love
participates
of
the
soul
itself
.
It
is
of
the
same
nature
.
Like
*NL*
it
,
it
is
the
divine
spark
;
like
it
,
it
is
incorruptible
,
indivisible
,
*NL*
imperishable
.
It
is
a
point
of
fire
that
exists
within
us
,
which
is
*NL*
immortal
and
infinite
,
which
nothing
can
confine
,
and
which
nothing
can
*NL*
extinguish
.
We
feel
it
burning
even
to
the
very
marrow
of
our
bones
,
and
*NL*
we
see
it
beaming
in
the
very
depths
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
Love
!
Adorations
!
voluptuousness
of
two
minds
which
understand
each
*NL*
other
,
of
two
hearts
which
exchange
with
each
other
,
of
two
glances
*NL*
which
penetrate
each
other
!
You
will
come
to
me
,
will
you
not
,
bliss
!
*NL*
strolls
by
twos
in
the
solitudes
!
Blessed
and
radiant
days
!
I
have
*NL*
sometimes
dreamed
that
from
time
to
time
hours
detached
themselves
from
*NL*
the
lives
of
the
angels
and
came
here
below
to
traverse
the
destinies
of
*NL*
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
God
can
add
nothing
to
the
happiness
of
those
who
love
,
except
to
give
*NL*
them
endless
duration
.
After
a
life
of
love
,
an
eternity
of
love
is
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
an
augmentation
;
but
to
increase
in
intensity
even
the
ineffable
*NL*
felicity
which
love
bestows
on
the
soul
even
in
this
world
,
is
*NL*
impossible
,
even
to
God
.
God
is
the
plenitude
of
heaven
;
love
is
the
*NL*
plenitude
of
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
You
look
at
a
star
for
two
reasons
,
because
it
is
luminous
,
and
because
*NL*
it
is
impenetrable
.
You
have
beside
you
a
sweeter
radiance
and
a
greater
*NL*
mystery
,
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
of
us
,
whoever
we
may
be
,
have
our
respirable
beings
.
We
lack
*NL*
air
and
we
stifle
.
Then
we
die
.
To
die
for
lack
of
love
is
horrible
.
*NL*
Suffocation
of
the
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
love
has
fused
and
mingled
two
beings
in
a
sacred
and
angelic
*NL*
unity
,
the
secret
of
life
has
been
discovered
so
far
as
they
are
*NL*
concerned
;
they
are
no
longer
anything
more
than
the
two
boundaries
of
*NL*
the
same
destiny
;
they
are
no
longer
anything
but
the
two
wings
of
the
*NL*
same
spirit
.
Love
,
soar
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
a
woman
as
she
passes
before
you
emits
light
as
she
*NL*
walks
,
you
are
lost
,
you
love
.
But
one
thing
remains
for
you
to
do
:
to
*NL*
think
of
her
so
intently
that
she
is
constrained
to
think
of
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
love
commences
can
be
finished
by
God
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
True
love
is
in
despair
and
is
enchanted
over
a
glove
lost
or
a
*NL*
handkerchief
found
,
and
eternity
is
required
for
its
devotion
and
its
*NL*
hopes
.
It
is
composed
both
of
the
infinitely
great
and
the
infinitely
*NL*
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
you
are
a
stone
,
be
adamant
;
if
you
are
a
plant
,
be
the
sensitive
*NL*
plant
;
if
you
are
a
man
,
be
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
suffices
for
love
.
We
have
happiness
,
we
desire
paradise
;
we
*NL*
possess
paradise
,
we
desire
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
ye
who
love
each
other
,
all
this
is
contained
in
love
.
Understand
*NL*
how
to
find
it
there
.
Love
has
contemplation
as
well
as
heaven
,
and
more
*NL*
than
heaven
,
it
has
voluptuousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
she
still
come
to
the
Luxembourg
?
''
``
No
,
sir
.
''
``
This
is
the
church
*NL*
where
she
attends
mass
,
is
it
not
?
''
``
She
no
longer
comes
here
.
''
``
Does
*NL*
she
still
live
in
this
house
?
''
``
She
has
moved
away
.
''
``
Where
has
she
gone
*NL*
to
dwell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
did
not
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
melancholy
thing
not
to
know
the
address
of
one
's
soul
!
*NL*
*NL*
Love
has
its
childishness
,
other
passions
have
their
pettinesses
.
Shame
*NL*
on
the
passions
which
belittle
man
!
Honor
to
the
one
which
makes
a
child
*NL*
of
him
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
one
strange
thing
,
do
you
know
it
?
I
dwell
in
the
night
.
There
*NL*
is
a
being
who
carried
off
my
sky
when
she
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
!
would
that
we
were
lying
side
by
side
in
the
same
grave
,
hand
*NL*
in
hand
,
and
from
time
to
time
,
in
the
darkness
,
gently
caressing
a
*NL*
finger
,
--
that
would
suffice
for
my
eternity
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ye
who
suffer
because
ye
love
,
love
yet
more
.
To
die
of
love
,
is
to
live
*NL*
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Love
.
A
sombre
and
starry
transfiguration
is
mingled
with
this
torture
.
*NL*
There
is
ecstasy
in
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
joy
of
the
birds
!
It
is
because
they
have
nests
that
they
sing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Love
is
a
celestial
respiration
of
the
air
of
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Deep
hearts
,
sage
minds
,
take
life
as
God
has
made
it
;
it
is
a
long
*NL*
trial
,
an
incomprehensible
preparation
for
an
unknown
destiny
.
This
*NL*
destiny
,
the
true
one
,
begins
for
a
man
with
the
first
step
inside
the
*NL*
tomb
.
Then
something
appears
to
him
,
and
he
begins
to
distinguish
the
*NL*
definitive
.
The
definitive
,
meditate
upon
that
word
.
The
living
perceive
*NL*
the
infinite
;
the
definitive
permits
itself
to
be
seen
only
by
the
dead
.
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
love
and
suffer
,
hope
and
contemplate
.
Woe
,
alas
!
to
*NL*
him
who
shall
have
loved
only
bodies
,
forms
,
appearances
!
Death
will
*NL*
deprive
him
of
all
.
Try
to
love
souls
,
you
will
find
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
encountered
in
the
street
,
a
very
poor
young
man
who
was
in
love
.
His
*NL*
hat
was
old
,
his
coat
was
worn
,
his
elbows
were
in
holes
;
water
trickled
*NL*
through
his
shoes
,
and
the
stars
through
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
grand
thing
it
is
to
be
loved
!
What
a
far
grander
thing
it
is
*NL*
to
love
!
The
heart
becomes
heroic
,
by
dint
of
passion
.
It
is
no
longer
*NL*
composed
of
anything
but
what
is
pure
;
it
no
longer
rests
on
anything
*NL*
that
is
not
elevated
and
great
.
An
unworthy
thought
can
no
more
*NL*
germinate
in
it
,
than
a
nettle
on
a
glacier
.
The
serene
and
lofty
soul
,
*NL*
inaccessible
to
vulgar
passions
and
emotions
,
dominating
the
clouds
*NL*
and
the
shades
of
this
world
,
its
follies
,
its
lies
,
its
hatreds
,
its
*NL*
vanities
,
its
miseries
,
inhabits
the
blue
of
heaven
,
and
no
longer
feels
*NL*
anything
but
profound
and
subterranean
shocks
of
destiny
,
as
the
crests
*NL*
of
mountains
feel
the
shocks
of
earthquake
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
If
there
did
not
exist
some
one
who
loved
,
the
sun
would
become
extinct
.

CHAPTER
V
--
COSETTE
AFTER
THE
LETTER
*NL*
*NL*
As
Cosette
read
,
she
gradually
fell
into
thought
.
At
the
very
moment
*NL*
when
she
raised
her
eyes
from
the
last
line
of
the
note-book
,
the
*NL*
handsome
officer
passed
triumphantly
in
front
of
the
gate
,
--
it
was
his
*NL*
hour
;
Cosette
thought
him
hideous
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
resumed
her
contemplation
of
the
book
.
It
was
written
in
the
most
*NL*
charming
of
chirography
,
thought
Cosette
;
in
the
same
hand
,
but
with
*NL*
divers
inks
,
sometimes
very
black
,
again
whitish
,
as
when
ink
has
been
*NL*
added
to
the
inkstand
,
and
consequently
on
different
days
.
It
was
,
*NL*
then
,
a
mind
which
had
unfolded
itself
there
,
sigh
by
sigh
,
irregularly
,
*NL*
without
order
,
without
choice
,
without
object
,
hap-hazard
.
Cosette
*NL*
had
never
read
anything
like
it
.
This
manuscript
,
in
which
she
already
*NL*
perceived
more
light
than
obscurity
,
produced
upon
her
the
effect
of
a
*NL*
half-open
sanctuary
.
Each
one
of
these
mysterious
lines
shone
before
*NL*
her
eyes
and
inundated
her
heart
with
a
strange
radiance
.
The
education
*NL*
which
she
had
received
had
always
talked
to
her
of
the
soul
,
and
never
*NL*
of
love
,
very
much
as
one
might
talk
of
the
firebrand
and
not
of
the
*NL*
flame
.
This
manuscript
of
fifteen
pages
suddenly
and
sweetly
revealed
*NL*
to
her
all
of
love
,
sorrow
,
destiny
,
life
,
eternity
,
the
beginning
,
*NL*
the
end
.
It
was
as
if
a
hand
had
opened
and
suddenly
flung
upon
her
*NL*
a
handful
of
rays
of
light
.
In
these
few
lines
she
felt
a
passionate
,
*NL*
ardent
,
generous
,
honest
nature
,
a
sacred
will
,
an
immense
sorrow
,
and
*NL*
an
immense
despair
,
a
suffering
heart
,
an
ecstasy
fully
expanded
.
What
*NL*
was
this
manuscript
?
A
letter
.
A
letter
without
name
,
without
address
,
*NL*
without
date
,
without
signature
,
pressing
and
disinterested
,
an
enigma
*NL*
composed
of
truths
,
a
message
of
love
made
to
be
brought
by
an
angel
and
*NL*
read
by
a
virgin
,
an
appointment
made
beyond
the
bounds
of
earth
,
the
*NL*
love-letter
of
a
phantom
to
a
shade
.
It
was
an
absent
one
,
tranquil
and
*NL*
dejected
,
who
seemed
ready
to
take
refuge
in
death
and
who
sent
to
the
*NL*
absent
love
,
his
lady
,
the
secret
of
fate
,
the
key
of
life
,
love
.
This
*NL*
had
been
written
with
one
foot
in
the
grave
and
one
finger
in
heaven
.
*NL*
These
lines
,
which
had
fallen
one
by
one
on
the
paper
,
were
what
might
*NL*
be
called
drops
of
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
from
whom
could
these
pages
come
?
Who
could
have
penned
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
did
not
hesitate
a
moment
.
One
man
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
!
*NL*
*NL*
Day
had
dawned
once
more
in
her
spirit
;
all
had
reappeared
.
She
felt
an
*NL*
unheard-of
joy
,
and
a
profound
anguish
.
It
was
he
!
he
who
had
written
!
*NL*
he
was
there
!
it
was
he
whose
arm
had
been
thrust
through
that
railing
!
*NL*
While
she
was
forgetful
of
him
,
he
had
found
her
again
!
But
had
she
*NL*
forgotten
him
?
No
,
never
!
She
was
foolish
to
have
thought
so
for
a
*NL*
single
moment
.
She
had
always
loved
him
,
always
adored
him
.
The
fire
had
*NL*
been
smothered
,
and
had
smouldered
for
a
time
,
but
she
saw
all
plainly
*NL*
now
;
it
had
but
made
headway
,
and
now
it
had
burst
forth
afresh
,
and
*NL*
had
inflamed
her
whole
being
.
This
note-book
was
like
a
spark
which
*NL*
had
fallen
from
that
other
soul
into
hers
.
She
felt
the
conflagration
*NL*
starting
up
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
imbued
herself
thoroughly
with
every
word
of
the
manuscript
:
``
Oh
*NL*
yes
!
''
said
she
,
``
how
perfectly
I
recognize
all
that
!
That
is
what
I
had
*NL*
already
read
in
his
eyes
.
''
As
she
was
finishing
it
for
the
third
time
,
*NL*
Lieutenant
Theodule
passed
the
gate
once
more
,
and
rattled
his
spurs
*NL*
upon
the
pavement
.
Cosette
was
forced
to
raise
her
eyes
.
She
thought
him
*NL*
insipid
,
silly
,
stupid
,
useless
,
foppish
,
displeasing
,
impertinent
,
and
*NL*
extremely
ugly
.
The
officer
thought
it
his
duty
to
smile
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
as
in
shame
and
indignation
.
She
would
gladly
have
*NL*
thrown
something
at
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fled
,
re-entered
the
house
,
and
shut
herself
up
in
her
chamber
to
*NL*
peruse
the
manuscript
once
more
,
to
learn
it
by
heart
,
and
to
dream
.
*NL*
When
she
had
thoroughly
mastered
it
she
kissed
it
and
put
it
in
her
*NL*
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
over
,
Cosette
had
fallen
back
into
deep
,
seraphic
love
.
The
*NL*
abyss
of
Eden
had
yawned
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
long
,
Cosette
remained
in
a
sort
of
bewilderment
.
She
scarcely
*NL*
thought
,
her
ideas
were
in
the
state
of
a
tangled
skein
in
her
brain
,
*NL*
she
could
not
manage
to
conjecture
anything
,
she
hoped
through
a
tremor
,
*NL*
what
?
vague
things
.
She
dared
make
herself
no
promises
,
and
she
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
refuse
herself
anything
.
Flashes
of
pallor
passed
over
her
*NL*
countenance
,
and
shivers
ran
through
her
frame
.
It
seemed
to
her
,
at
*NL*
intervals
,
that
she
was
entering
the
land
of
chimaeras
;
she
said
to
*NL*
herself
:
``
Is
this
reality
?
''
Then
she
felt
of
the
dear
paper
within
her
*NL*
bosom
under
her
gown
,
she
pressed
it
to
her
heart
,
she
felt
its
angles
*NL*
against
her
flesh
;
and
if
Jean
Valjean
had
seen
her
at
the
moment
,
he
*NL*
would
have
shuddered
in
the
presence
of
that
luminous
and
unknown
joy
,
*NL*
which
overflowed
from
beneath
her
eyelids
.
--
``
Oh
yes
!
''
she
thought
,
``
it
*NL*
is
certainly
he
!
This
comes
from
him
,
and
is
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
told
herself
that
an
intervention
of
the
angels
,
a
celestial
*NL*
chance
,
had
given
him
back
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
transfiguration
of
love
!
Oh
dreams
!
That
celestial
chance
,
that
*NL*
intervention
of
the
angels
,
was
a
pellet
of
bread
tossed
by
one
thief
to
*NL*
another
thief
,
from
the
Charlemagne
Courtyard
to
the
Lion
's
Ditch
,
over
*NL*
the
roofs
of
La
Force
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
OLD
PEOPLE
ARE
MADE
TO
GO
OUT
OPPORTUNELY
*NL*
*NL*
When
evening
came
,
Jean
Valjean
went
out
;
Cosette
dressed
herself
.
She
*NL*
arranged
her
hair
in
the
most
becoming
manner
,
and
she
put
on
a
dress
*NL*
whose
bodice
had
received
one
snip
of
the
scissors
too
much
,
and
which
,
*NL*
through
this
slope
,
permitted
a
view
of
the
beginning
of
her
throat
,
and
*NL*
was
,
as
young
girls
say
,
``
a
trifle
indecent
.
''
It
was
not
in
the
least
*NL*
indecent
,
but
it
was
prettier
than
usual
.
She
made
her
toilet
thus
*NL*
without
knowing
why
she
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
she
mean
to
go
out
?
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
she
expecting
a
visitor
?
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dusk
,
she
went
down
to
the
garden
.
Toussaint
was
busy
in
her
kitchen
,
*NL*
which
opened
on
the
back
yard
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
stroll
about
under
the
trees
,
thrusting
aside
the
branches
*NL*
from
time
to
time
with
her
hand
,
because
there
were
some
which
hung
very
*NL*
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
she
reached
the
bench
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
stone
was
still
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
down
,
and
gently
laid
her
white
hand
on
this
stone
as
though
she
*NL*
wished
to
caress
and
thank
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
she
experienced
that
indefinable
impression
which
one
*NL*
undergoes
when
there
is
some
one
standing
behind
one
,
even
when
she
does
*NL*
not
see
the
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
and
rose
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
was
bare
.
He
appeared
to
have
grown
thin
and
pale
.
His
black
*NL*
clothes
were
hardly
discernible
.
The
twilight
threw
a
wan
light
on
*NL*
his
fine
brow
,
and
covered
his
eyes
in
shadows
.
Beneath
a
veil
of
*NL*
incomparable
sweetness
,
he
had
something
about
him
that
suggested
death
*NL*
and
night
.
His
face
was
illuminated
by
the
light
of
the
dying
day
,
and
*NL*
by
the
thought
of
a
soul
that
is
taking
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
be
not
yet
a
ghost
,
and
he
was
no
longer
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
flung
away
his
hat
in
the
thicket
,
a
few
paces
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
though
ready
to
swoon
,
uttered
no
cry
.
She
retreated
slowly
,
*NL*
for
she
felt
herself
attracted
.
He
did
not
stir
.
By
virtue
of
something
*NL*
ineffable
and
melancholy
which
enveloped
him
,
she
felt
the
look
in
his
*NL*
eyes
which
she
could
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
in
her
retreat
,
encountered
a
tree
and
leaned
against
it
.
Had
*NL*
it
not
been
for
this
tree
,
she
would
have
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
heard
his
voice
,
that
voice
which
she
had
really
never
heard
,
*NL*
barely
rising
above
the
rustle
of
the
leaves
,
and
murmuring
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
here
I
am
.
My
heart
is
full
.
I
could
not
live
on
as
I
was
*NL*
living
,
and
I
have
come
.
Have
you
read
what
I
placed
there
on
the
bench
?
*NL*
Do
you
recognize
me
at
all
?
Have
no
fear
of
me
.
It
is
a
long
time
,
you
*NL*
remember
the
day
,
since
you
looked
at
me
at
the
Luxembourg
,
near
the
*NL*
Gladiator
.
And
the
day
when
you
passed
before
me
?
It
was
on
the
16th
of
*NL*
June
and
the
2d
of
July
.
It
is
nearly
a
year
ago
.
I
have
not
seen
you
*NL*
for
a
long
time
.
I
inquired
of
the
woman
who
let
the
chairs
,
and
she
*NL*
told
me
that
she
no
longer
saw
you
.
You
lived
in
the
Rue
de
l'Ouest
,
on
*NL*
the
third
floor
,
in
the
front
apartments
of
a
new
house
,
--
you
see
that
*NL*
I
know
!
I
followed
you
.
What
else
was
there
for
me
to
do
?
And
then
you
*NL*
disappeared
.
I
thought
I
saw
you
pass
once
,
while
I
was
reading
the
*NL*
newspapers
under
the
arcade
of
the
Odeon
.
I
ran
after
you
.
But
no
.
It
*NL*
was
a
person
who
had
a
bonnet
like
yours
.
At
night
I
came
hither
.
Do
*NL*
not
be
afraid
,
no
one
sees
me
.
I
come
to
gaze
upon
your
windows
near
*NL*
at
hand
.
I
walk
very
softly
,
so
that
you
may
not
hear
,
for
you
might
be
*NL*
alarmed
.
The
other
evening
I
was
behind
you
,
you
turned
round
,
I
fled
.
*NL*
Once
,
I
heard
you
singing
.
I
was
happy
.
Did
it
affect
you
because
I
*NL*
heard
you
singing
through
the
shutters
?
That
could
not
hurt
you
.
No
,
*NL*
it
is
not
so
?
You
see
,
you
are
my
angel
!
Let
me
come
sometimes
;
I
think
*NL*
that
I
am
going
to
die
.
If
you
only
knew
!
I
adore
you
.
Forgive
me
,
I
*NL*
speak
to
you
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
I
am
saying
;
I
may
have
displeased
*NL*
you
;
have
I
displeased
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
my
mother
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
sank
down
as
though
on
the
point
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
grasped
her
,
she
fell
,
he
took
her
in
his
arms
,
he
pressed
her
close
,
*NL*
without
knowing
what
he
was
doing
.
He
supported
her
,
though
he
was
*NL*
tottering
himself
.
It
was
as
though
his
brain
were
full
of
smoke
;
*NL*
lightnings
darted
between
his
lips
;
his
ideas
vanished
;
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
he
was
accomplishing
some
religious
act
,
and
that
he
was
committing
*NL*
a
profanation
.
Moreover
,
he
had
not
the
least
passion
for
this
lovely
*NL*
woman
whose
force
he
felt
against
his
breast
.
He
was
beside
himself
with
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
hand
and
laid
it
on
her
heart
.
He
felt
the
paper
there
,
he
*NL*
stammered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
love
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
in
a
voice
so
low
that
it
was
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
*NL*
barely
audible
breath
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
Thou
knowest
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
hid
her
blushing
face
on
the
breast
of
the
superb
and
*NL*
intoxicated
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
upon
the
bench
,
and
she
beside
him
.
They
had
no
words
more
.
The
*NL*
stars
were
beginning
to
gleam
.
How
did
it
come
to
pass
that
their
lips
*NL*
met
?
How
comes
it
to
pass
that
the
birds
sing
,
that
snow
melts
,
that
*NL*
the
rose
unfolds
,
that
May
expands
,
that
the
dawn
grows
white
behind
the
*NL*
black
trees
on
the
shivering
crest
of
the
hills
?
*NL*
*NL*
A
kiss
,
and
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
started
,
and
gazed
into
the
darkness
with
sparkling
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
felt
neither
the
cool
night
,
nor
the
cold
stone
,
nor
the
damp
*NL*
earth
,
nor
the
wet
grass
;
they
looked
at
each
other
,
and
their
hearts
*NL*
were
full
of
thoughts
.
They
had
clasped
hands
unconsciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
ask
him
,
she
did
not
even
wonder
,
how
he
had
entered
there
,
*NL*
and
how
he
had
made
his
way
into
the
garden
.
It
seemed
so
simple
to
her
*NL*
that
he
should
be
there
!
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
,
Marius
'
knee
touched
Cosette
's
knee
,
and
both
*NL*
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
intervals
,
Cosette
stammered
a
word
.
Her
soul
fluttered
on
her
lips
*NL*
like
a
drop
of
dew
on
a
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
they
began
to
talk
to
each
other
.
Effusion
followed
*NL*
silence
,
which
is
fulness
.
The
night
was
serene
and
splendid
overhead
.
*NL*
These
two
beings
,
pure
as
spirits
,
told
each
other
everything
,
their
*NL*
dreams
,
their
intoxications
,
their
ecstasies
,
their
chimaeras
,
their
*NL*
weaknesses
,
how
they
had
adored
each
other
from
afar
,
how
they
had
*NL*
longed
for
each
other
,
their
despair
when
they
had
ceased
to
see
each
*NL*
other
.
They
confided
to
each
other
in
an
ideal
intimacy
,
which
nothing
*NL*
could
augment
,
their
most
secret
and
most
mysterious
thoughts
.
They
*NL*
related
to
each
other
,
with
candid
faith
in
their
illusions
,
all
that
*NL*
love
,
youth
,
and
the
remains
of
childhood
which
still
lingered
about
*NL*
them
,
suggested
to
their
minds
.
Their
two
hearts
poured
themselves
out
*NL*
into
each
other
in
such
wise
,
that
at
the
expiration
of
a
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
,
it
was
the
young
man
who
had
the
young
girl
's
soul
,
and
the
young
*NL*
girl
who
had
the
young
man
's
soul
.
Each
became
permeated
with
the
other
,
*NL*
they
were
enchanted
with
each
other
,
they
dazzled
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
finished
,
when
they
had
told
each
other
everything
,
she
*NL*
laid
her
head
on
his
shoulder
and
asked
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

*NL*
*NL*

said

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
MALICIOUS
PLAYFULNESS
OF
THE
WIND
*NL*
*NL*
Since
1823
,
when
the
tavern
of
Montfermeil
was
on
the
way
to
shipwreck
*NL*
and
was
being
gradually
engulfed
,
not
in
the
abyss
of
a
bankruptcy
,
but
*NL*
in
the
cesspool
of
petty
debts
,
the
Thenardier
pair
had
had
two
other
*NL*
children
;
both
males
.
That
made
five
;
two
girls
and
three
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
had
got
rid
of
the
last
two
,
while
they
were
still
*NL*
young
and
very
small
,
with
remarkable
luck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Got
rid
of
is
the
word
.
There
was
but
a
mere
fragment
of
nature
in
that
*NL*
woman
.
A
phenomenon
,
by
the
way
,
of
which
there
is
more
than
one
example
*NL*
extant
.
Like
the
Marechale
de
La
Mothe-Houdancourt
,
the
Thenardier
was
*NL*
a
mother
to
her
daughters
only
.
There
her
maternity
ended
.
Her
hatred
of
*NL*
the
human
race
began
with
her
own
sons
.
In
the
direction
of
her
sons
her
*NL*
evil
disposition
was
uncompromising
,
and
her
heart
had
a
lugubrious
wall
*NL*
in
that
quarter
.
As
the
reader
has
seen
,
she
detested
the
eldest
;
she
*NL*
cursed
the
other
two
.
Why
?
Because
.
The
most
terrible
of
motives
,
the
*NL*
most
unanswerable
of
retorts
--
Because
.
``
I
have
no
need
of
a
litter
of
*NL*
squalling
brats
,
''
said
this
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
explain
how
the
Thenardiers
had
succeeded
in
getting
rid
of
their
*NL*
last
two
children
;
and
even
in
drawing
profit
from
the
operation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
Magnon
,
who
was
mentioned
a
few
pages
further
back
,
was
the
*NL*
same
one
who
had
succeeded
in
making
old
Gillenormand
support
the
two
*NL*
children
which
she
had
had
.
She
lived
on
the
Quai
des
Celestins
,
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
this
ancient
street
of
the
Petit-Musc
which
afforded
her
the
*NL*
opportunity
of
changing
her
evil
repute
into
good
odor
.
The
reader
will
*NL*
remember
the
great
epidemic
of
croup
which
ravaged
the
river
districts
*NL*
of
the
Seine
in
Paris
thirty-five
years
ago
,
and
of
which
science
took
*NL*
advantage
to
make
experiments
on
a
grand
scale
as
to
the
efficacy
of
*NL*
inhalations
of
alum
,
so
beneficially
replaced
at
the
present
day
by
the
*NL*
external
tincture
of
iodine
.
During
this
epidemic
,
the
Magnon
lost
both
*NL*
her
boys
,
who
were
still
very
young
,
one
in
the
morning
,
the
other
*NL*
in
the
evening
of
the
same
day
.
This
was
a
blow
.
These
children
were
*NL*
precious
to
their
mother
;
they
represented
eighty
francs
a
month
.
These
*NL*
eighty
francs
were
punctually
paid
in
the
name
of
M.
Gillenormand
,
by
*NL*
collector
of
his
rents
,
M.
Barge
,
a
retired
tip-staff
,
in
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Roi-de-Sicile
.
The
children
dead
,
the
income
was
at
an
end
.
The
Magnon
*NL*
sought
an
expedient
.
In
that
dark
free-masonry
of
evil
of
which
she
*NL*
formed
a
part
,
everything
is
known
,
all
secrets
are
kept
,
and
all
lend
*NL*
mutual
aid
.
Magnon
needed
two
children
;
the
Thenardiers
had
two
.
*NL*
The
same
sex
,
the
same
age
.
A
good
arrangement
for
the
one
,
a
good
*NL*
investment
for
the
other
.
The
little
Thenardiers
became
little
Magnons
.
*NL*
Magnon
quitted
the
Quai
des
Celestins
and
went
to
live
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Clocheperce
.
In
Paris
,
the
identity
which
binds
an
individual
to
himself
*NL*
is
broken
between
one
street
and
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
registry
office
being
in
no
way
warned
,
raised
no
objections
,
and
*NL*
the
substitution
was
effected
in
the
most
simple
manner
in
the
world
.
*NL*
Only
,
the
Thenardier
exacted
for
this
loan
of
her
children
,
ten
francs
a
*NL*
month
,
which
Magnon
promised
to
pay
,
and
which
she
actually
did
pay
.
*NL*
It
is
unnecessary
to
add
that
M.
Gillenormand
continued
to
perform
*NL*
his
compact
.
He
came
to
see
the
children
every
six
months
.
He
did
not
*NL*
perceive
the
change
.
``
Monsieur
,
''
Magnon
said
to
him
,
``
how
much
they
*NL*
resemble
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
to
whom
avatars
were
easy
,
seized
this
occasion
to
become
*NL*
Jondrette
.
His
two
daughters
and
Gavroche
had
hardly
had
time
to
*NL*
discover
that
they
had
two
little
brothers
.
When
a
certain
degree
*NL*
of
misery
is
reached
,
one
is
overpowered
with
a
sort
of
spectral
*NL*
indifference
,
and
one
regards
human
beings
as
though
they
were
spectres
.
*NL*
Your
nearest
relations
are
often
no
more
for
you
than
vague
shadowy
*NL*
forms
,
barely
outlined
against
a
nebulous
background
of
life
and
easily
*NL*
confounded
again
with
the
invisible
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
of
the
day
when
she
had
handed
over
her
two
little
*NL*
ones
to
Magnon
,
with
express
intention
of
renouncing
them
forever
,
the
*NL*
Thenardier
had
felt
,
or
had
appeared
to
feel
,
a
scruple
.
She
said
to
her
*NL*
husband
:
``
But
this
is
abandoning
our
children
!
''
Thenardier
,
masterful
*NL*
and
phlegmatic
,
cauterized
the
scruple
with
this
saying
:
``
Jean
Jacques
*NL*
Rousseau
did
even
better
!
''
From
scruples
,
the
mother
proceeded
to
*NL*
uneasiness
:
``
But
what
if
the
police
were
to
annoy
us
?
Tell
me
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Thenardier
,
is
what
we
have
done
permissible
?
''
Thenardier
replied
:
*NL*
``
Everything
is
permissible
.
No
one
will
see
anything
but
true
blue
in
*NL*
it
.
Besides
,
no
one
has
any
interest
in
looking
closely
after
children
*NL*
who
have
not
a
sou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Magnon
was
a
sort
of
fashionable
woman
in
the
sphere
of
crime
.
She
was
*NL*
careful
about
her
toilet
.
She
shared
her
lodgings
,
which
were
furnished
*NL*
in
an
affected
and
wretched
style
,
with
a
clever
gallicized
English
*NL*
thief
.
This
English
woman
,
who
had
become
a
naturalized
Parisienne
,
*NL*
recommended
by
very
wealthy
relations
,
intimately
connected
with
the
*NL*
medals
in
the
Library
and
Mademoiselle
Mar
's
diamonds
,
became
celebrated
*NL*
later
on
in
judicial
accounts
.
She
was
called
Mamselle
Miss.
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
little
creatures
who
had
fallen
to
Magnon
had
no
reason
to
*NL*
complain
of
their
lot
.
Recommended
by
the
eighty
francs
,
they
were
well
*NL*
cared
for
,
as
is
everything
from
which
profit
is
derived
;
they
were
*NL*
neither
badly
clothed
,
nor
badly
fed
;
they
were
treated
almost
like
*NL*
``
little
gentlemen
,
''
--
better
by
their
false
mother
than
by
their
real
*NL*
one
.
Magnon
played
the
lady
,
and
talked
no
thieves
'
slang
in
their
*NL*
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
passed
several
years
.
Thenardier
augured
well
from
the
fact
.
One
*NL*
day
,
he
chanced
to
say
to
Magnon
as
she
handed
him
his
monthly
stipend
*NL*
of
ten
francs
:
``
The
father
must
give
them
some
education
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
these
two
poor
children
,
who
had
up
to
that
time
been
*NL*
protected
tolerably
well
,
even
by
their
evil
fate
,
were
abruptly
hurled
*NL*
into
life
and
forced
to
begin
it
for
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wholesale
arrest
of
malefactors
,
like
that
in
the
Jondrette
garret
,
*NL*
necessarily
complicated
by
investigations
and
subsequent
incarcerations
,
*NL*
is
a
veritable
disaster
for
that
hideous
and
occult
counter-society
*NL*
which
pursues
its
existence
beneath
public
society
;
an
adventure
of
this
*NL*
description
entails
all
sorts
of
catastrophes
in
that
sombre
world
.
The
*NL*
Thenardier
catastrophe
involved
the
catastrophe
of
Magnon
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
a
short
time
after
Magnon
had
handed
to
Eponine
the
note
*NL*
relating
to
the
Rue
Plumet
,
a
sudden
raid
was
made
by
the
police
in
the
*NL*
Rue
Clocheperce
;
Magnon
was
seized
,
as
was
also
Mamselle
Miss
;
and
all
*NL*
the
inhabitants
of
the
house
,
which
was
of
a
suspicious
character
,
were
*NL*
gathered
into
the
net
.
While
this
was
going
on
,
the
two
little
boys
were
*NL*
playing
in
the
back
yard
,
and
saw
nothing
of
the
raid
.
When
they
tried
*NL*
to
enter
the
house
again
,
they
found
the
door
fastened
and
the
house
*NL*
empty
.
A
cobbler
opposite
called
them
to
him
,
and
delivered
to
them
a
*NL*
paper
which
``
their
mother
''
had
left
for
them
.
On
this
paper
there
was
an
*NL*
address
:
M.
Barge
,
collector
of
rents
,
Rue
du
Roi-de-Sicile
,
No.
8
.
The
*NL*
proprietor
of
the
stall
said
to
them
:
``
You
can
not
live
here
any
longer
.
*NL*
Go
there
.
It
is
near
by
.
The
first
street
on
the
left
.
Ask
your
way
from
*NL*
this
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
set
out
,
the
elder
leading
the
younger
,
and
holding
in
his
*NL*
hand
the
paper
which
was
to
guide
them
.
It
was
cold
,
and
his
benumbed
*NL*
little
fingers
could
not
close
very
firmly
,
and
they
did
not
keep
a
very
*NL*
good
hold
on
the
paper
.
At
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Clocheperce
,
a
gust
of
*NL*
wind
tore
it
from
him
,
and
as
night
was
falling
,
the
child
was
not
able
*NL*
to
find
it
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
began
to
wander
aimlessly
through
the
streets
.

CHAPTER
II
--
IN
WHICH
LITTLE
GAVROCHE
EXTRACTS
PROFIT
FROM
NAPOLEON
THE
*NL*
GREAT
*NL*
*NL*
Spring
in
Paris
is
often
traversed
by
harsh
and
piercing
breezes
which
*NL*
do
not
precisely
chill
but
freeze
one
;
these
north
winds
which
sadden
*NL*
the
most
beautiful
days
produce
exactly
the
effect
of
those
puffs
of
*NL*
cold
air
which
enter
a
warm
room
through
the
cracks
of
a
badly
fitting
*NL*
door
or
window
.
It
seems
as
though
the
gloomy
door
of
winter
had
*NL*
remained
ajar
,
and
as
though
the
wind
were
pouring
through
it
.
In
the
*NL*
spring
of
1832
,
the
epoch
when
the
first
great
epidemic
of
this
century
*NL*
broke
out
in
Europe
,
these
north
gales
were
more
harsh
and
piercing
*NL*
than
ever
.
It
was
a
door
even
more
glacial
than
that
of
winter
which
*NL*
was
ajar
.
It
was
the
door
of
the
sepulchre
.
In
these
winds
one
felt
the
*NL*
breath
of
the
cholera
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
meteorological
point
of
view
,
these
cold
winds
possessed
this
*NL*
peculiarity
,
that
they
did
not
preclude
a
strong
electric
tension
.
*NL*
Frequent
storms
,
accompanied
by
thunder
and
lightning
,
burst
forth
at
*NL*
this
epoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
when
these
gales
were
blowing
rudely
,
to
such
a
degree
that
*NL*
January
seemed
to
have
returned
and
that
the
bourgeois
had
resumed
their
*NL*
cloaks
,
Little
Gavroche
,
who
was
always
shivering
gayly
under
his
rags
,
*NL*
was
standing
as
though
in
ecstasy
before
a
wig-maker
's
shop
in
the
*NL*
vicinity
of
the
Orme-Saint-Gervais
.
He
was
adorned
with
a
woman
's
*NL*
woollen
shawl
,
picked
up
no
one
knows
where
,
and
which
he
had
converted
*NL*
into
a
neck
comforter
.
Little
Gavroche
appeared
to
be
engaged
in
intent
*NL*
admiration
of
a
wax
bride
,
in
a
low-necked
dress
,
and
crowned
with
*NL*
orange-flowers
,
who
was
revolving
in
the
window
,
and
displaying
her
*NL*
smile
to
passers-by
,
between
two
argand
lamps
;
but
in
reality
,
he
was
*NL*
taking
an
observation
of
the
shop
,
in
order
to
discover
whether
he
*NL*
could
not
``
prig
''
from
the
shop-front
a
cake
of
soap
,
which
he
would
then
*NL*
proceed
to
sell
for
a
sou
to
a
``
hair-dresser
''
in
the
suburbs
.
He
had
*NL*
often
managed
to
breakfast
off
of
such
a
roll
.
He
called
his
species
of
*NL*
work
,
for
which
he
possessed
special
aptitude
,
``
shaving
barbers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
contemplating
the
bride
,
and
eyeing
the
cake
of
soap
,
he
muttered
*NL*
between
his
teeth
:
``
Tuesday
.
It
was
not
Tuesday
.
Was
it
Tuesday
?
Perhaps
*NL*
it
was
Tuesday
.
Yes
,
it
was
Tuesday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
has
ever
discovered
to
what
this
monologue
referred
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
perchance
,
this
monologue
had
some
connection
with
the
last
*NL*
occasion
on
which
he
had
dined
,
three
days
before
,
for
it
was
now
*NL*
Friday
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barber
in
his
shop
,
which
was
warmed
by
a
good
stove
,
was
shaving
*NL*
a
customer
and
casting
a
glance
from
time
to
time
at
the
enemy
,
that
*NL*
freezing
and
impudent
street
urchin
both
of
whose
hands
were
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
but
whose
mind
was
evidently
unsheathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Gavroche
was
scrutinizing
the
shop-window
and
the
cakes
of
windsor
*NL*
soap
,
two
children
of
unequal
stature
,
very
neatly
dressed
,
and
still
*NL*
smaller
than
himself
,
one
apparently
about
seven
years
of
age
,
the
other
*NL*
five
,
timidly
turned
the
handle
and
entered
the
shop
,
with
a
request
for
*NL*
something
or
other
,
alms
possibly
,
in
a
plaintive
murmur
which
resembled
*NL*
a
groan
rather
than
a
prayer
.
They
both
spoke
at
once
,
and
their
words
*NL*
were
unintelligible
because
sobs
broke
the
voice
of
the
younger
,
and
the
*NL*
teeth
of
the
elder
were
chattering
with
cold
.
The
barber
wheeled
round
*NL*
with
a
furious
look
,
and
without
abandoning
his
razor
,
thrust
back
the
*NL*
elder
with
his
left
hand
and
the
younger
with
his
knee
,
and
slammed
*NL*
his
door
,
saying
:
``
The
idea
of
coming
in
and
freezing
everybody
for
*NL*
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
resumed
their
march
in
tears
.
In
the
meantime
,
a
cloud
*NL*
had
risen
;
it
had
begun
to
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Gavroche
ran
after
them
and
accosted
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
,
brats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
know
where
we
are
to
sleep
,
''
replied
the
elder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
said
Gavroche
.
``
A
great
matter
,
truly
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
bawling
about
that
.
They
must
be
greenies
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
adopting
,
in
addition
to
his
superiority
,
which
was
rather
*NL*
bantering
,
an
accent
of
tender
authority
and
gentle
patronage
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
with
me
,
young
`
uns
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
said
the
elder
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
two
children
followed
him
as
they
would
have
followed
an
*NL*
archbishop
.
They
had
stopped
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
led
them
up
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
Bastille
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Gavroche
walked
along
,
he
cast
an
indignant
backward
glance
at
the
*NL*
barber
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
fellow
has
no
heart
,
the
whiting
,
''
-LSB-
35
-RSB-
he
muttered
.
``
He
's
an
*NL*
Englishman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
who
caught
sight
of
these
three
marching
in
a
file
,
with
*NL*
Gavroche
at
their
head
,
burst
into
noisy
laughter
.
This
laugh
was
*NL*
wanting
in
respect
towards
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
day
,
Mamselle
Omnibus
,
''
said
Gavroche
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
later
,
the
wig-maker
occurred
to
his
mind
once
more
,
and
he
*NL*
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
making
a
mistake
in
the
beast
;
he
's
not
a
whiting
,
he
's
a
serpent
.
*NL*
Barber
,
I
'll
go
and
fetch
a
locksmith
,
and
I
'll
have
a
bell
hung
to
your
*NL*
tail
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
wig-maker
had
rendered
him
aggressive
.
As
he
strode
over
a
gutter
,
*NL*
he
apostrophized
a
bearded
portress
who
was
worthy
to
meet
Faust
on
the
*NL*
Brocken
,
and
who
had
a
broom
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madam
,
''
said
he
,
``
so
you
are
going
out
with
your
horse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
thereupon
,
he
spattered
the
polished
boots
of
a
pedestrian
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
scamp
!
''
shouted
the
furious
pedestrian
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
elevated
his
nose
above
his
shawl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Monsieur
complaining
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
you
!
''
ejaculated
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
office
is
closed
,
''
said
Gavroche
,
``
I
do
not
receive
any
more
*NL*
complaints
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
as
he
went
on
up
the
street
,
he
perceived
a
*NL*
beggar-girl
,
thirteen
or
fourteen
years
old
,
and
clad
in
so
short
a
*NL*
gown
that
her
knees
were
visible
,
lying
thoroughly
chilled
under
a
*NL*
porte-cochere
.
The
little
girl
was
getting
to
be
too
old
for
such
a
*NL*
thing
.
Growth
does
play
these
tricks
.
The
petticoat
becomes
short
at
the
*NL*
moment
when
nudity
becomes
indecent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
!
''
said
Gavroche
.
``
She
has
n't
even
trousers
.
Hold
on
,
take
*NL*
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
unwinding
all
the
comfortable
woollen
which
he
had
around
his
neck
,
*NL*
he
flung
it
on
the
thin
and
purple
shoulders
of
the
beggar-girl
,
where
*NL*
the
scarf
became
a
shawl
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
,
and
received
the
shawl
in
*NL*
silence
.
When
a
certain
stage
of
distress
has
been
reached
in
his
*NL*
misery
,
the
poor
man
no
longer
groans
over
evil
,
no
longer
returns
*NL*
thanks
for
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
:
``
Brrr
!
''
said
Gavroche
,
who
was
shivering
more
than
Saint
*NL*
Martin
,
for
the
latter
retained
one-half
of
his
cloak
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
brrr
!
the
downpour
of
rain
,
redoubled
in
its
spite
,
became
*NL*
furious
.
The
wicked
skies
punish
good
deeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
now
!
''
exclaimed
Gavroche
,
``
what
's
the
meaning
of
this
?
It
's
*NL*
re-raining
!
Good
Heavens
,
if
it
goes
on
like
this
,
I
shall
stop
my
*NL*
subscription
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
set
out
on
the
march
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
''
he
resumed
,
casting
a
glance
at
the
beggar-girl
,
as
*NL*
she
coiled
up
under
the
shawl
,
``
she
's
got
a
famous
peel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
looking
up
at
the
clouds
he
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caught
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
followed
close
on
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
were
passing
one
of
these
heavy
grated
lattices
,
which
indicate
*NL*
a
baker
's
shop
,
for
bread
is
put
behind
bars
like
gold
,
Gavroche
turned
*NL*
round
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
brats
,
have
we
dined
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
replied
the
elder
,
``
we
have
had
nothing
to
eat
since
this
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
neither
father
nor
mother
?
''
resumed
Gavroche
majestically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
us
,
sir
,
we
have
a
papa
and
a
mamma
,
but
we
do
n't
know
where
*NL*
they
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
that
's
better
than
knowing
where
they
are
,
''
said
Gavroche
,
*NL*
who
was
a
thinker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
been
wandering
about
these
two
hours
,
''
continued
the
elder
,
``
we
*NL*
have
hunted
for
things
at
the
corners
of
the
streets
,
but
we
have
found
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
''
ejaculated
Gavroche
,
``
it
's
the
dogs
who
eat
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
,
after
a
pause
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
we
have
lost
our
authors
.
We
do
n't
know
what
we
have
done
with
*NL*
them
.
This
should
not
be
,
gamins
.
It
's
stupid
to
let
old
people
stray
*NL*
off
like
that
.
Come
now
!
we
must
have
a
snooze
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
asked
them
no
questions
.
What
was
more
simple
than
that
they
*NL*
should
have
no
dwelling
place
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
of
the
two
children
,
who
had
almost
entirely
recovered
the
*NL*
prompt
heedlessness
of
childhood
,
uttered
this
exclamation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
queer
,
all
the
same
.
Mamma
told
us
that
she
would
take
us
to
get
a
*NL*
blessed
spray
on
Palm
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bosh
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mamma
,
''
resumed
the
elder
,
``
is
a
lady
who
lives
with
Mamselle
Miss.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tanflute
!
''
retorted
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
he
had
halted
,
and
for
the
last
two
minutes
he
had
been
*NL*
feeling
and
fumbling
in
all
sorts
of
nooks
which
his
rags
contained
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
tossed
his
head
with
an
air
intended
to
be
merely
satisfied
,
*NL*
but
which
was
triumphant
,
in
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
calm
,
young
`
uns
.
Here
's
supper
for
three
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
from
one
of
his
pockets
he
drew
forth
a
sou
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
allowing
the
two
urchins
time
for
amazement
,
he
pushed
both
of
*NL*
them
before
him
into
the
baker
's
shop
,
and
flung
his
sou
on
the
counter
,
*NL*
crying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boy
!
five
centimes
'
worth
of
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baker
,
who
was
the
proprietor
in
person
,
took
up
a
loaf
and
a
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
three
pieces
,
my
boy
!
''
went
on
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
with
dignity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
three
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
seeing
that
the
baker
,
after
scrutinizing
the
three
customers
,
had
*NL*
taken
down
a
black
loaf
,
he
thrust
his
finger
far
up
his
nose
with
*NL*
an
inhalation
as
imperious
as
though
he
had
had
a
pinch
of
the
great
*NL*
Frederick
's
snuff
on
the
tip
of
his
thumb
,
and
hurled
this
indignant
*NL*
apostrophe
full
in
the
baker
's
face
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keksekca
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
of
our
readers
who
might
be
tempted
to
espy
in
this
interpellation
*NL*
of
Gavroche
's
to
the
baker
a
Russian
or
a
Polish
word
,
or
one
of
those
*NL*
savage
cries
which
the
Yoways
and
the
Botocudos
hurl
at
each
other
from
*NL*
bank
to
bank
of
a
river
,
athwart
the
solitudes
,
are
warned
that
it
is
a
*NL*
word
which
they
-LSB-
our
readers
-RSB-
utter
every
day
,
and
which
takes
the
place
*NL*
of
the
phrase
:
``
Qu'est
-
ce
que
c'est
que
cela
?
''
The
baker
understood
*NL*
perfectly
,
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
It
's
bread
,
and
very
good
bread
of
the
second
quality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
larton
brutal
-LSB-
black
bread
-RSB-
!
''
retorted
Gavroche
,
calmly
and
*NL*
coldly
disdainful
.
``
White
bread
,
boy
!
white
bread
-LSB-
larton
savonne
-RSB-
!
I
'm
*NL*
standing
treat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
baker
could
not
repress
a
smile
,
and
as
he
cut
the
white
bread
he
*NL*
surveyed
them
in
a
compassionate
way
which
shocked
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
baker
's
boy
!
''
said
he
,
``
what
are
you
taking
our
measure
like
*NL*
that
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
of
them
placed
end
to
end
would
have
hardly
made
a
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
bread
was
cut
,
the
baker
threw
the
sou
into
his
drawer
,
and
*NL*
Gavroche
said
to
the
two
children
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grub
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
boys
stared
at
him
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
hullo
,
that
's
so
!
they
do
n't
understand
yet
,
they
're
too
small
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
repeated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eat
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
he
held
out
a
piece
of
bread
to
each
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
thinking
that
the
elder
,
who
seemed
to
him
the
more
worthy
of
*NL*
his
conversation
,
deserved
some
special
encouragement
and
ought
to
be
*NL*
relieved
from
all
hesitation
to
satisfy
his
appetite
,
he
added
,
as
be
*NL*
handed
him
the
largest
share
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ram
that
into
your
muzzle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
piece
was
smaller
than
the
others
;
he
kept
this
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
children
,
including
Gavroche
,
were
famished
.
As
they
tore
their
*NL*
bread
apart
in
big
mouthfuls
,
they
blocked
up
the
shop
of
the
baker
,
*NL*
who
,
now
that
they
had
paid
their
money
,
looked
angrily
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
go
into
the
street
again
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
set
off
once
more
in
the
direction
of
the
Bastille
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
,
as
they
passed
the
lighted
shop-windows
,
the
smallest
*NL*
halted
to
look
at
the
time
on
a
leaden
watch
which
was
suspended
from
*NL*
his
neck
by
a
cord
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
is
a
very
green
`
un
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
becoming
thoughtful
,
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
same
,
if
I
had
charge
of
the
babes
I
'd
lock
'em
up
better
than
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
they
were
finishing
their
morsel
of
bread
,
and
had
reached
the
*NL*
angle
of
that
gloomy
Rue
des
Ballets
,
at
the
other
end
of
which
the
low
*NL*
and
threatening
wicket
of
La
Force
was
visible
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
is
that
you
,
Gavroche
?
''
said
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
is
that
you
,
Montparnasse
?
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
had
just
accosted
the
street
urchin
,
and
the
man
was
no
other
*NL*
than
Montparnasse
in
disguise
,
with
blue
spectacles
,
but
recognizable
to
*NL*
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bow-wows
!
''
went
on
Gavroche
,
``
you
've
got
a
hide
the
color
of
a
*NL*
linseed
plaster
,
and
blue
specs
like
a

You
're
putting
on
style
,
*NL*

pon
my

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
''
ejaculated
Montparnasse
,
``
not
so
loud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
drew
Gavroche
hastily
out
of
range
of
the
lighted
shops
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
little
ones
followed
mechanically
,
holding
each
other
by
the
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
ensconced
under
the
arch
of
a
portecochere
,
sheltered
*NL*
from
the
rain
and
from
all
eyes
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
I
'm
going
?
''
demanded
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
Abbey
of
Ascend-with-Regret
,
''
-LSB-
36
-RSB-
replied
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joker
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Montparnasse
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
find
Babet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
exclaimed
Gavroche
,
``
so
her
name
is
Babet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
lowered
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
she
,
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Babet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Babet

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
he
was
buckled

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
undone
the
buckle

''
replied
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
rapidly
related
to
the
gamin
how
,
on
the
morning
of
that
very
*NL*
day
,
Babet
,
having
been
transferred
to
La
Conciergerie
,
had
made
his
*NL*
escape
,
by
turning
to
the
left
instead
of
to
the
right
in
``
the
police
*NL*
office
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
expressed
his
admiration
for
this
skill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dentist
!
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
added
a
few
details
as
to
Babet
's
flight
,
and
ended
with
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
That
's
not
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
as
he
listened
,
had
seized
a
cane
that
Montparnasse
held
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
mechanically
pulled
at
the
upper
part
,
and
the
blade
of
a
*NL*
dagger
made
its
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
pushing
the
dagger
back
in
haste
,
``
you
have
brought
*NL*
along
your
gendarme
disguised
as
a
bourgeois

''
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
winked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce

resumed
Gavroche
,
``
so
you
're
going
to
have
a
bout
with
the
*NL*
bobbies

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

replied
Montparnasse
with
an
indifferent
air
.
``
It
's
*NL*
always
a
good
thing
to
have
a
pin
about
one

*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
persisted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
up
to
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Montparnasse
took
a
grave
tone
,
and
said
,
mouthing
every
syllable
:
*NL*
``
Things

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
abruptly
changing
the
conversation
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
By

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something

He
makes

me
a

a
sermon
and
his

I
put
it
in

A
minute
*NL*
later

I
feel
in

There

nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Except

said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

went
on
Montparnasse
,
``
where
are
you
bound
for

*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
pointed
to
his
two
proteges

and
said
:

*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
,
though
not
naturally
inclined
to
astonishment

could
not
*NL*
restrain
an
exclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

retorted
Gavroche

``

*NL*
*NL*
This
is
another
word
of
the
language

no

writes

every

The
urchin
's
profound
remark
recalled
Montparnasse
to
calmness
and
*NL*
good
sense
.
He
appeared
to
return
to
better
sentiments
with
regard
to

Gavroche
's
lodging

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

elephant
.
Is
it
comfortable
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
``
It
's
really
bully
there
.
There
ai
n't
any
*NL*
draughts
,
as
there
are
under
the
bridges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
get
in
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
get
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
there
is
a
hole
?
''
demanded
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parbleu
!
I
should
say
so
.
But
you
must
n't
tell
.
It
's
between
the
fore
*NL*
legs
.
The
bobbies
have
n't
seen
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
climb
up
?
Yes
,
I
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
turn
of
the
hand
,
cric
,
crac
,
and
it
's
all
over
,
no
one
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
,
Gavroche
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
a
ladder
for
these
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
burst
out
laughing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
devil
did
you
pick
up
those
young
`
uns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
replied
with
great
simplicity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
some
brats
that
a
wig-maker
made
me
a
present
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Montparnasse
had
fallen
to
thinking
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
recognized
me
very
readily
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
from
his
pocket
two
small
objects
which
were
nothing
more
than
*NL*
two
quills
wrapped
in
cotton
,
and
thrust
one
up
each
of
his
nostrils
.
*NL*
This
gave
him
a
different
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
changes
you
,
''
remarked
Gavroche
,
``
you
are
less
homely
so
,
you
*NL*
ought
to
keep
them
on
all
the
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
was
a
handsome
fellow
,
but
Gavroche
was
a
tease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seriously
,
''
demanded
Montparnasse
,
``
how
do
you
like
me
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
his
voice
was
different
also
.
In
a
twinkling
,
Montparnasse
*NL*
had
become
unrecognizable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Do
play
Porrichinelle
for
us
!
''
exclaimed
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
,
who
had
not
been
listening
up
to
this
point
,
being
*NL*
occupied
themselves
in
thrusting
their
fingers
up
their
noses
,
drew
*NL*
near
at
this
name
,
and
stared
at
Montparnasse
with
dawning
joy
and
*NL*
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
Montparnasse
was
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
hand
on
Gavroche
's
shoulder
,
and
said
to
him
,
emphasizing
*NL*
his
words
:
``
Listen
to
what
I
tell
you
,
boy
!
if
I
were
on
the
square
with
*NL*
my
dog
,
my
knife
,
and
my
wife
,
and
if
you
were
to
squander
ten
sous
on
*NL*
me
,
I
would
n't
refuse
to
work
,
but
this
is
n't
Shrove
Tuesday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
odd
phrase
produced
a
singular
effect
on
the
gamin
.
He
wheeled
*NL*
round
hastily
,
darted
his
little
sparkling
eyes
about
him
with
profound
*NL*
attention
,
and
perceived
a
police
sergeant
standing
with
his
back
to
*NL*
them
a
few
paces
off
.
Gavroche
allowed
an
:
``
Ah
!
good
!
''
to
escape
him
,
*NL*
but
immediately
suppressed
it
,
and
shaking
Montparnasse
's
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good
evening
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'm
going
off
to
my
elephant
with
my
*NL*
brats
.
Supposing
that
you
should
need
me
some
night
,
you
can
come
and
*NL*
hunt
me
up
there
.
I
lodge
on
the
entresol
.
There
is
no
porter
.
You
will
*NL*
inquire
for
Monsieur
Gavroche
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
,
''
said
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
parted
,
Montparnasse
betaking
himself
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
the
Greve
,
and
Gavroche
towards
the
Bastille
.
The
little
one
of
five
,
*NL*
dragged
along
by
his
brother
who
was
dragged
by
Gavroche
,
turned
his
*NL*
head
back
several
times
to
watch
``
Porrichinelle
''
as
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ambiguous
phrase
by
means
of
which
Montparnasse
had
warned
Gavroche
*NL*
of
the
presence
of
the
policeman
,
contained
no
other
talisman
than
*NL*
the
assonance
dig
repeated
five
or
six
times
in
different
forms
.
This
*NL*
syllable
,
dig
,
uttered
alone
or
artistically
mingled
with
the
words
of
*NL*
a
phrase
,
means
:
``
Take
care
,
we
can
no
longer
talk
freely
.
''
There
was
*NL*
besides
,
in
Montparnasse
's
sentence
,
a
literary
beauty
which
was
*NL*
lost
upon
Gavroche
,
that
is
mon
dogue
,
ma
dague
et
ma
digue
,
a
slang
*NL*
expression
of
the
Temple
,
which
signifies
my
dog
,
my
knife
,
and
my
wife
,
*NL*
greatly
in
vogue
among
clowns
and
the
red-tails
in
the
great
century
*NL*
when
Moliere
wrote
and
Callot
drew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
years
ago
,
there
was
still
to
be
seen
in
the
southwest
corner
of
*NL*
the
Place
de
la
Bastille
,
near
the
basin
of
the
canal
,
excavated
in
the
*NL*
ancient
ditch
of
the
fortress-prison
,
a
singular
monument
,
which
has
*NL*
already
been
effaced
from
the
memories
of
Parisians
,
and
which
deserved
*NL*
to
leave
some
trace
,
for
it
was
the
idea
of
a
``
member
of
the
Institute
,
*NL*
the
General-in-chief
of
the
army
of
Egypt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
say
monument
,
although
it
was
only
a
rough
model
.
But
this
model
*NL*
itself
,
a
marvellous
sketch
,
the
grandiose
skeleton
of
an
idea
of
*NL*
Napoleon
's
,
which
successive
gusts
of
wind
have
carried
away
and
thrown
,
*NL*
on
each
occasion
,
still
further
from
us
,
had
become
historical
and
had
*NL*
acquired
a
certain
definiteness
which
contrasted
with
its
provisional
*NL*
aspect
.
It
was
an
elephant
forty
feet
high
,
constructed
of
timber
and
*NL*
masonry
,
bearing
on
its
back
a
tower
which
resembled
a
house
,
formerly
*NL*
painted
green
by
some
dauber
,
and
now
painted
black
by
heaven
,
the
wind
,
*NL*
and
time
.
In
this
deserted
and
unprotected
corner
of
the
place
,
the
*NL*
broad
brow
of
the
colossus
,
his
trunk
,
his
tusks
,
his
tower
,
his
*NL*
enormous
crupper
,
his
four
feet
,
like
columns
produced
,
at
night
,
under
*NL*
the
starry
heavens
,
a
surprising
and
terrible
form
.
It
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
symbol
of
popular
force
.
It
was
sombre
,
mysterious
,
and
immense
.
It
was
*NL*
some
mighty
,
visible
phantom
,
one
knew
not
what
,
standing
erect
beside
*NL*
the
invisible
spectre
of
the
Bastille
.
*NL*
*NL*
Few
strangers
visited
this
edifice
,
no
passer-by
looked
at
it
.
It
was
*NL*
falling
into
ruins
;
every
season
the
plaster
which
detached
itself
*NL*
from
its
sides
formed
hideous
wounds
upon
it
.
``
The
aediles
,
''
as
the
*NL*
expression
ran
in
elegant
dialect
,
had
forgotten
it
ever
since
1814
.
*NL*
There
it
stood
in
its
corner
,
melancholy
,
sick
,
crumbling
,
surrounded
*NL*
by
a
rotten
palisade
,
soiled
continually
by
drunken
coachmen
;
cracks
*NL*
meandered
athwart
its
belly
,
a
lath
projected
from
its
tail
,
tall
grass
*NL*
flourished
between
its
legs
;
and
,
as
the
level
of
the
place
had
been
*NL*
rising
all
around
it
for
a
space
of
thirty
years
,
by
that
slow
and
*NL*
continuous
movement
which
insensibly
elevates
the
soil
of
large
towns
,
*NL*
it
stood
in
a
hollow
,
and
it
looked
as
though
the
ground
were
giving
way
*NL*
beneath
it
.
It
was
unclean
,
despised
,
repulsive
,
and
superb
,
ugly
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
the
bourgeois
,
melancholy
in
the
eyes
of
the
thinker
.
There
was
*NL*
something
about
it
of
the
dirt
which
is
on
the
point
of
being
swept
out
,
*NL*
and
something
of
the
majesty
which
is
on
the
point
of
being
decapitated
.
*NL*
As
we
have
said
,
at
night
,
its
aspect
changed
.
Night
is
the
real
element
*NL*
of
everything
that
is
dark
.
As
soon
as
twilight
descended
,
the
old
*NL*
elephant
became
transfigured
;
he
assumed
a
tranquil
and
redoubtable
*NL*
appearance
in
the
formidable
serenity
of
the
shadows
.
Being
of
the
past
,
*NL*
he
belonged
to
night
;
and
obscurity
was
in
keeping
with
his
grandeur
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rough
,
squat
,
heavy
,
hard
,
austere
,
almost
misshapen
,
but
assuredly
*NL*
majestic
monument
,
stamped
with
a
sort
of
magnificent
and
savage
*NL*
gravity
,
has
disappeared
,
and
left
to
reign
in
peace
,
a
sort
of
gigantic
*NL*
stove
,
ornamented
with
its
pipe
,
which
has
replaced
the
sombre
fortress
*NL*
with
its
nine
towers
,
very
much
as
the
bourgeoisie
replaces
the
feudal
*NL*
classes
.
It
is
quite
natural
that
a
stove
should
be
the
symbol
of
an
*NL*
epoch
in
which
a
pot
contains
power
.
This
epoch
will
pass
away
,
people
*NL*
have
already
begun
to
understand
that
,
if
there
can
be
force
in
a
*NL*
boiler
,
there
can
be
no
force
except
in
the
brain
;
in
other
words
,
*NL*
that
which
leads
and
drags
on
the
world
,
is
not
locomotives
,
but
ideas
.
*NL*
Harness
locomotives
to
ideas
,
--
that
is
well
done
;
but
do
not
mistake
the
*NL*
horse
for
the
rider
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
,
to
return
to
the
Place
de
la
Bastille
,
the
architect
*NL*
of
this
elephant
succeeded
in
making
a
grand
thing
out
of
plaster
;
the
*NL*
architect
of
the
stove
has
succeeded
in
making
a
pretty
thing
out
of
*NL*
bronze
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stove-pipe
,
which
has
been
baptized
by
a
sonorous
name
,
and
called
*NL*
the
column
of
July
,
this
monument
of
a
revolution
that
miscarried
,
*NL*
was
still
enveloped
in
1832
,
in
an
immense
shirt
of
woodwork
,
which
we
*NL*
regret
,
for
our
part
,
and
by
a
vast
plank
enclosure
,
which
completed
the
*NL*
task
of
isolating
the
elephant
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
towards
this
corner
of
the
place
,
dimly
lighted
by
the
reflection
*NL*
of
a
distant
street
lamp
,
that
the
gamin
guided
his
two
``
brats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
must
permit
us
to
interrupt
ourselves
here
and
to
remind
him
*NL*
that
we
are
dealing
with
simple
reality
,
and
that
twenty
years
ago
,
the
*NL*
tribunals
were
called
upon
to
judge
,
under
the
charge
of
vagabondage
,
*NL*
and
mutilation
of
a
public
monument
,
a
child
who
had
been
caught
asleep
*NL*
in
this
very
elephant
of
the
Bastille
.
This
fact
noted
,
we
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
in
the
vicinity
of
the
colossus
,
Gavroche
comprehended
the
*NL*
effect
which
the
infinitely
great
might
produce
on
the
infinitely
small
,
*NL*
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
scared
,
infants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
entered
through
a
gap
in
the
fence
into
the
elephant
's
enclosure
*NL*
and
helped
the
young
ones
to
clamber
through
the
breach
.
The
two
*NL*
children
,
somewhat
frightened
,
followed
Gavroche
without
uttering
a
*NL*
word
,
and
confided
themselves
to
this
little
Providence
in
rags
which
*NL*
had
given
them
bread
and
had
promised
them
a
shelter
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
,
extended
along
the
fence
,
lay
a
ladder
which
by
day
served
*NL*
the
laborers
in
the
neighboring
timber-yard
.
Gavroche
raised
it
with
*NL*
remarkable
vigor
,
and
placed
it
against
one
of
the
elephant
's
forelegs
.
*NL*
Near
the
point
where
the
ladder
ended
,
a
sort
of
black
hole
in
the
belly
*NL*
of
the
colossus
could
be
distinguished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
pointed
out
the
ladder
and
the
hole
to
his
guests
,
and
said
to
*NL*
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climb
up
and
go
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
little
boys
exchanged
terrified
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
afraid
,
brats
!
''
exclaimed
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clasped
the
rough
leg
of
the
elephant
,
and
in
a
twinkling
,
without
*NL*
deigning
to
make
use
of
the
ladder
,
he
had
reached
the
aperture
.
He
*NL*
entered
it
as
an
adder
slips
through
a
crevice
,
and
disappeared
within
,
*NL*
and
an
instant
later
,
the
two
children
saw
his
head
,
which
looked
pale
,
*NL*
appear
vaguely
,
on
the
edge
of
the
shadowy
hole
,
like
a
wan
and
whitish
*NL*
spectre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
climb
up
,
young
`
uns
!
You
'll
see
how
snug
it
is
*NL*
here
!
Come
up
,
you
!
''
he
said
to
the
elder
,
``
I
'll
lend
you
a
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
fellows
nudged
each
other
,
the
gamin
frightened
and
inspired
*NL*
them
with
confidence
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
and
then
,
it
was
raining
*NL*
very
hard
.
The
elder
one
undertook
the
risk
.
The
younger
,
on
seeing
his
*NL*
brother
climbing
up
,
and
himself
left
alone
between
the
paws
of
this
*NL*
huge
beast
,
felt
greatly
inclined
to
cry
,
but
he
did
not
dare
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
lad
climbed
,
with
uncertain
steps
,
up
the
rungs
of
the
ladder
;
*NL*
Gavroche
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
encouraging
him
with
exclamations
like
a
*NL*
fencing-master
to
his
pupils
,
or
a
muleteer
to
his
mules
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
!
--
That
's
it
!
--
Come
on
!
--
Put
your
feet
there
!
--
Give
us
*NL*
your
hand
here
!
--
Boldly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
when
the
child
was
within
reach
,
he
seized
him
suddenly
and
*NL*
vigorously
by
the
arm
,
and
pulled
him
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nabbed
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
brat
had
passed
through
the
crack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Gavroche
,
``
wait
for
me
.
Be
so
good
as
to
take
a
seat
,
*NL*
Monsieur
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
making
his
way
out
of
the
hole
as
he
had
entered
it
,
he
slipped
down
*NL*
the
elephant
's
leg
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
,
landed
on
his
feet
in
*NL*
the
grass
,
grasped
the
child
of
five
round
the
body
,
and
planted
him
*NL*
fairly
in
the
middle
of
the
ladder
,
then
he
began
to
climb
up
behind
*NL*
him
,
shouting
to
the
elder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
boost
him
,
do
you
tug
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
in
another
instant
,
the
small
lad
was
pushed
,
dragged
,
pulled
,
*NL*
thrust
,
stuffed
into
the
hole
,
before
he
had
time
to
recover
himself
,
*NL*
and
Gavroche
,
entering
behind
him
,
and
repulsing
the
ladder
with
a
kick
*NL*
which
sent
it
flat
on
the
grass
,
began
to
clap
his
hands
and
to
cry
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
!
Long
live
General
Lafayette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
explosion
over
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
young
`
uns
,
you
are
in
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
was
at
home
,
in
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
unforeseen
utility
of
the
useless
!
Charity
of
great
things
!
Goodness
*NL*
of
giants
!
This
huge
monument
,
which
had
embodied
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
Emperor
's
,
had
become
the
box
of
a
street
urchin
.
The
brat
had
been
*NL*
accepted
and
sheltered
by
the
colossus
.
The
bourgeois
decked
out
in
*NL*
their
Sunday
finery
who
passed
the
elephant
of
the
Bastille
,
were
fond
*NL*
of
saying
as
they
scanned
it
disdainfully
with
their
prominent
eyes
:
*NL*
``
What
's
the
good
of
that
?
''
It
served
to
save
from
the
cold
,
the
frost
,
*NL*
the
hail
,
and
rain
,
to
shelter
from
the
winds
of
winter
,
to
preserve
*NL*
from
slumber
in
the
mud
which
produces
fever
,
and
from
slumber
in
the
*NL*
snow
which
produces
death
,
a
little
being
who
had
no
father
,
no
mother
,
*NL*
no
bread
,
no
clothes
,
no
refuge
.
It
served
to
receive
the
innocent
whom
*NL*
society
repulsed
.
It
served
to
diminish
public
crime
.
It
was
a
lair
*NL*
open
to
one
against
whom
all
doors
were
shut
.
It
seemed
as
though
the
*NL*
miserable
old
mastodon
,
invaded
by
vermin
and
oblivion
,
covered
with
*NL*
warts
,
with
mould
,
and
ulcers
,
tottering
,
worm-eaten
,
abandoned
,
*NL*
condemned
,
a
sort
of
mendicant
colossus
,
asking
alms
in
vain
with
a
*NL*
benevolent
look
in
the
midst
of
the
cross-roads
,
had
taken
pity
on
that
*NL*
other
mendicant
,
the
poor
pygmy
,
who
roamed
without
shoes
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
without
a
roof
over
his
head
,
blowing
on
his
fingers
,
clad
in
rags
,
fed
*NL*
on
rejected
scraps
.
That
was
what
the
elephant
of
the
Bastille
was
good
*NL*
for
.
This
idea
of
Napoleon
,
disdained
by
men
,
had
been
taken
back
by
*NL*
God
.
That
which
had
been
merely
illustrious
,
had
become
august
.
In
order
*NL*
to
realize
his
thought
,
the
Emperor
should
have
had
porphyry
,
brass
,
*NL*
iron
,
gold
,
marble
;
the
old
collection
of
planks
,
beams
and
plaster
*NL*
sufficed
for
God
.
The
Emperor
had
had
the
dream
of
a
genius
;
in
that
*NL*
Titanic
elephant
,
armed
,
prodigious
,
with
trunk
uplifted
,
bearing
its
*NL*
tower
and
scattering
on
all
sides
its
merry
and
vivifying
waters
,
he
*NL*
wished
to
incarnate
the
people
.
God
had
done
a
grander
thing
with
it
,
he
*NL*
had
lodged
a
child
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hole
through
which
Gavroche
had
entered
was
a
breach
which
was
*NL*
hardly
visible
from
the
outside
,
being
concealed
,
as
we
have
stated
,
*NL*
beneath
the
elephant
's
belly
,
and
so
narrow
that
it
was
only
cats
and
*NL*
homeless
children
who
could
pass
through
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
begin
,
''
said
Gavroche
,
``
by
telling
the
porter
that
we
are
not
at
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
plunging
into
the
darkness
with
the
assurance
of
a
person
who
is
*NL*
well
acquainted
with
his
apartments
,
he
took
a
plank
and
stopped
up
the
*NL*
aperture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Gavroche
plunged
into
the
obscurity
.
The
children
heard
the
*NL*
crackling
of
the
match
thrust
into
the
phosphoric
bottle
.
The
chemical
*NL*
match
was
not
yet
in
existence
;
at
that
epoch
the
Fumade
steel
*NL*
represented
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
sudden
light
made
them
blink
;
Gavroche
had
just
managed
to
ignite
one
*NL*
of
those
bits
of
cord
dipped
in
resin
which
are
called
cellar
rats
.
The
*NL*
cellar
rat
,
which
emitted
more
smoke
than
light
,
rendered
the
interior
*NL*
of
the
elephant
confusedly
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
's
two
guests
glanced
about
them
,
and
the
sensation
which
they
*NL*
experienced
was
something
like
that
which
one
would
feel
if
shut
up
in
*NL*
the
great
tun
of
Heidelberg
,
or
,
better
still
,
like
what
Jonah
must
have
*NL*
felt
in
the
biblical
belly
of
the
whale
.
An
entire
and
gigantic
skeleton
*NL*
appeared
enveloping
them
.
Above
,
a
long
brown
beam
,
whence
started
at
*NL*
regular
distances
,
massive
,
arching
ribs
,
represented
the
vertebral
*NL*
column
with
its
sides
,
stalactites
of
plaster
depended
from
them
like
*NL*
entrails
,
and
vast
spiders
'
webs
stretching
from
side
to
side
,
formed
*NL*
dirty
diaphragms
.
Here
and
there
,
in
the
corners
,
were
visible
large
*NL*
blackish
spots
which
had
the
appearance
of
being
alive
,
and
which
*NL*
changed
places
rapidly
with
an
abrupt
and
frightened
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fragments
which
had
fallen
from
the
elephant
's
back
into
his
belly
had
*NL*
filled
up
the
cavity
,
so
that
it
was
possible
to
walk
upon
it
as
on
a
*NL*
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smaller
child
nestled
up
against
his
brother
,
and
whispered
to
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
black
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
remark
drew
an
exclamation
from
Gavroche
.
The
petrified
air
of
the
*NL*
two
brats
rendered
some
shock
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
you
are
gabbling
about
there
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
scoffing
at
me
?
Are
you
turning
up
your
noses
?
Do
you
want
the
*NL*
tuileries
?
Are
you
brutes
?
Come
,
say
!
I
warn
you
that
I
do
n't
belong
to
*NL*
the
regiment
of
simpletons
.
Ah
,
come
now
,
are
you
brats
from
the
Pope
's
*NL*
establishment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
roughness
is
good
in
cases
of
fear
.
It
is
reassuring
.
The
two
*NL*
children
drew
close
to
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
paternally
touched
by
this
confidence
,
passed
from
grave
to
*NL*
gentle
,
and
addressing
the
smaller
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stupid
,
''
said
he
,
accenting
the
insulting
word
,
with
a
caressing
*NL*
intonation
,
``
it
's
outside
that
it
is
black
.
Outside
it
's
raining
,
here
*NL*
it
does
not
rain
;
outside
it
's
cold
,
here
there
's
not
an
atom
of
wind
;
*NL*
outside
there
are
heaps
of
people
,
here
there
's
no
one
;
outside
there
*NL*
ai
n't
even
the
moon
,
here
there
's
my
candle
,
confound
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
began
to
look
upon
the
apartment
with
less
terror
;
but
*NL*
Gavroche
allowed
them
no
more
time
for
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pushed
them
towards
what
we
are
very
glad
to
be
able
to
call
the
*NL*
end
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
stood
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
's
bed
was
complete
;
that
is
to
say
,
it
had
a
mattress
,
a
*NL*
blanket
,
and
an
alcove
with
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mattress
was
a
straw
mat
,
the
blanket
a
rather
large
strip
of
*NL*
gray
woollen
stuff
,
very
warm
and
almost
new
.
This
is
what
the
alcove
*NL*
consisted
of
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Three
rather
long
poles
,
thrust
into
and
consolidated
,
with
the
rubbish
*NL*
which
formed
the
floor
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
belly
of
the
elephant
,
two
*NL*
in
front
and
one
behind
,
and
united
by
a
rope
at
their
summits
,
so
as
to
*NL*
form
a
pyramidal
bundle
.
This
cluster
supported
a
trellis-work
of
brass
*NL*
wire
which
was
simply
placed
upon
it
,
but
artistically
applied
,
and
held
*NL*
by
fastenings
of
iron
wire
,
so
that
it
enveloped
all
three
holes
.
A
row
*NL*
of
very
heavy
stones
kept
this
network
down
to
the
floor
so
that
nothing
*NL*
could
pass
under
it
.
This
grating
was
nothing
else
than
a
piece
of
the
*NL*
brass
screens
with
which
aviaries
are
covered
in
menageries
.
Gavroche
's
*NL*
bed
stood
as
in
a
cage
,
behind
this
net
.
The
whole
resembled
an
*NL*
Esquimaux
tent
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
trellis-work
took
the
place
of
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
moved
aside
the
stones
which
fastened
the
net
down
in
front
,
*NL*
and
the
two
folds
of
the
net
which
lapped
over
each
other
fell
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
on
all
fours
,
brats
!
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
his
guests
enter
the
cage
with
great
precaution
,
then
he
crawled
*NL*
in
after
them
,
pulled
the
stones
together
,
and
closed
the
opening
*NL*
hermetically
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
had
stretched
out
on
the
mat
.
Gavroche
still
had
the
cellar
*NL*
rat
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
he
,
``
go
to
sleep
!
I
'm
going
to
suppress
the
candelabra
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
the
elder
of
the
brothers
asked
Gavroche
,
pointing
to
the
*NL*
netting
,
``
what
's
that
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
,
''
answered
Gavroche
gravely
,
``
is
for
the
rats
.
Go
to
sleep
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
felt
obliged
to
add
a
few
words
of
instruction
for
the
*NL*
benefit
of
these
young
creatures
,
and
he
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
thing
from
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
.
It
's
used
for
fierce
animals
.
*NL*
There
's
a
whole
shopful
of
them
there
.
All
you
've
got
to
do
is
to
climb
*NL*
over
a
wall
,
crawl
through
a
window
,
and
pass
through
a
door
.
You
can
*NL*
get
as
much
as
you
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
he
wrapped
the
younger
one
up
bodily
in
a
fold
of
the
*NL*
blanket
,
and
the
little
one
murmured
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
how
good
that
is
!
It
's
warm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
cast
a
pleased
eye
on
the
blanket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
from
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
,
too
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
took
that
from
*NL*
the
monkeys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
pointing
out
to
the
eldest
the
mat
on
which
he
was
lying
,
a
very
*NL*
thick
and
admirably
made
mat
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
belonged
to
the
giraffe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
he
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
beasts
had
all
these
things
.
I
took
them
away
from
them
.
It
did
n't
*NL*
trouble
them
.
I
told
them
:
`
It
's
for
the
elephant
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
then
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
crawl
over
the
walls
and
you
do
n't
care
a
straw
for
the
government
.
*NL*
So
there
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
gazed
with
timid
and
stupefied
respect
on
this
*NL*
intrepid
and
ingenious
being
,
a
vagabond
like
themselves
,
isolated
*NL*
like
themselves
,
frail
like
themselves
,
who
had
something
admirable
*NL*
and
all-powerful
about
him
,
who
seemed
supernatural
to
them
,
and
whose
*NL*
physiognomy
was
composed
of
all
the
grimaces
of
an
old
mountebank
,
*NL*
mingled
with
the
most
ingenuous
and
charming
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
ventured
the
elder
timidly
,
``
you
are
not
afraid
of
the
*NL*
police
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
contented
himself
with
replying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brat
!
Nobody
says
`
police
,
'
they
say
`
bobbies
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
smaller
had
his
eyes
wide
open
,
but
he
said
nothing
.
As
he
was
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
the
mat
,
the
elder
being
in
the
middle
,
Gavroche
tucked
the
*NL*
blanket
round
him
as
a
mother
might
have
done
,
and
heightened
the
mat
*NL*
under
his
head
with
old
rags
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
form
a
pillow
for
the
*NL*
child
.
Then
he
turned
to
the
elder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
We
're
jolly
comfortable
here
,
ai
n't
we
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
''
replied
the
elder
,
gazing
at
Gavroche
with
the
expression
of
*NL*
a
saved
angel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
poor
little
children
who
had
been
soaked
through
,
began
to
grow
*NL*
warm
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
''
continued
Gavroche
,
``
what
were
you
bawling
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
pointing
out
the
little
one
to
his
brother
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mite
like
that
,
I
've
nothing
to
say
about
,
but
the
idea
of
a
big
*NL*
fellow
like
you
crying
!
It
's
idiotic
;
you
looked
like
a
calf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
,
''
replied
the
child
,
``
we
have
no
lodging
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother
!
''
retorted
Gavroche
,
``
you
do
n't
say
`
lodgings
,
'
you
say
`
crib
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
we
were
afraid
of
being
alone
like
that
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
say

night

you
say
`
darkmans

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
sir
,
''
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen

''
went
on
Gavroche
,
``
you
must
never
bawl
again
over
anything
.
*NL*
I
'll
take
care
of
you
.
You
shall
see
what
fun
we
'll
have
.
In
summer
,
*NL*
we
'll
go
to
the
Glaciere
with
Navet
,
one
of
my
pals
,
we
'll
bathe
in
*NL*
the
Gare
,
we
'll
run
stark
naked
in
front
of
the
rafts
on
the
bridge
at
*NL*
Austerlitz
,
--
that
makes
the
laundresses
raging
.
They
scream
,
they
get
*NL*
mad
,
and
if
you
only
knew
how
ridiculous
they
are
!
We
'll
go
and
see
the
*NL*
man-skeleton
.
And
then
I
'll
take
you
to
the
play
.
I
'll
take
you
to
see
*NL*
Frederick
Lemaitre
.
I
have
tickets
,
I
know
some
of
the
actors
,
I
even
*NL*
played
in
a
piece
once
.
There
were
a
lot
of
us
fellers
,
and
we
ran
*NL*
under
a
cloth
,
and
that
made
the
sea
.
I
'll
get
you
an
engagement
at
my
*NL*
theatre
.
We
'll
go
to
see
the
savages
.
They
ai
n't
real
,
those
savages
*NL*
ai
n't
.
They
wear
pink
tights
that
go
all
in
wrinkles
,
and
you
can
see
*NL*
where
their
elbows
have
been
darned
with
white
.
Then
,
we
'll
go
to
the
*NL*
Opera
.
We
'll
get
in
with
the
hired
applauders
.
The
Opera
claque
is
well
*NL*
managed
.
I
would
n't
associate
with
the
claque
on
the
boulevard
.
At
the
*NL*
Opera
,
just
fancy
!
some
of
them
pay
twenty
sous
,
but
they
're
ninnies
.
*NL*
They
're
called
dishclouts
.
And
then
we
'll
go
to
see
the
guillotine
work
.
*NL*
I
'll
show
you
the
executioner
.
He
lives
in
the
Rue
des
Marais
.
Monsieur
*NL*
Sanson
.
He
has
a
letter-box
at
his
door
.
Ah
!
we
'll
have
famous
fun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
a
drop
of
wax
fell
on
Gavroche
's
finger
,
and
recalled
him
*NL*
to
the
realities
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
deuce
!
''
said
he
,
``
there
's
the
wick
giving
out
.
Attention
!
I
ca
n't
*NL*
spend
more
than
a
sou
a
month
on
my
lighting
.
When
a
body
goes
to
bed
,
*NL*
he
must
sleep
.
We
have
n't
the
time
to
read
M.
Paul
de
Kock
's
*NL*
romances
.
And
besides
,
the
light
might
pass
through
the
cracks
of
the
*NL*
porte-cochere
,
and
all
the
bobbies
need
to
do
is
to
see
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
,
''
remarked
the
elder
timidly
,
--
he
alone
dared
talk
to
*NL*
Gavroche
,
and
reply
to
him
,
``
a
spark
might
fall
in
the
straw
,
and
we
*NL*
must
look
out
and
not
burn
the
house
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
do
n't
say
`
burn
the
house
down
,
'
''
remarked
Gavroche
,
``
they
say
*NL*
`
blaze
the
crib
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
storm
increased
in
violence
,
and
the
heavy
downpour
beat
upon
the
*NL*
back
of
the
colossus
amid
claps
of
thunder
.
``
You
're
taken
in
,
rain
!
''
*NL*
said
Gavroche
.
``
It
amuses
me
to
hear
the
decanter
run
down
the
legs
of
*NL*
the
house
.
Winter
is
a
stupid
;
it
wastes
its
merchandise
,
it
loses
*NL*
its
labor
,
it
ca
n't
wet
us
,
and
that
makes
it
kick
up
a
row
,
old
*NL*
water-carrier
that
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
allusion
to
the
thunder
,
all
the
consequences
of
which
Gavroche
,
in
*NL*
his
character
of
a
philosopher
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
accepted
,
was
*NL*
followed
by
a
broad
flash
of
lightning
,
so
dazzling
that
a
hint
of
it
*NL*
entered
the
belly
of
the
elephant
through
the
crack
.
Almost
at
the
same
*NL*
instant
,
the
thunder
rumbled
with
great
fury
.
The
two
little
creatures
*NL*
uttered
a
shriek
,
and
started
up
so
eagerly
that
the
network
came
near
*NL*
being
displaced
,
but
Gavroche
turned
his
bold
face
to
them
,
and
took
*NL*
advantage
of
the
clap
of
thunder
to
burst
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Calm
down
,
children
.
Do
n't
topple
over
the
edifice
.
That
's
fine
,
*NL*
first-class
thunder
;
all
right
.
That
's
no
slouch
of
a
streak
of
*NL*
lightning
.
Bravo
for
the
good
God
!
Deuce
take
it
!
It
's
almost
as
good
as
*NL*
it
is
at
the
Ambigu
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
he
restored
order
in
the
netting
,
pushed
the
two
children
*NL*
gently
down
on
the
bed
,
pressed
their
knees
,
in
order
to
stretch
them
*NL*
out
at
full
length
,
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
the
good
God
is
lighting
his
candle
,
I
can
blow
out
mine
.
Now
,
*NL*
babes
,
now
,
my
young
humans
,
you
must
shut
your
peepers
.
It
's
very
bad
*NL*
not
to
sleep
.
It
'll
make
you
swallow
the
strainer
,
or
,
as
they
say
,
in
*NL*
fashionable
society
,
stink
in
the
gullet
.
Wrap
yourself
up
well
in
the
*NL*
hide
!
I
'm
going
to
put
out
the
light
.
Are
you
ready
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
murmured
the
elder
,
``
I
'm
all
right
.
I
seem
to
have
feathers
under
*NL*
my
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
do
n't
say
`
head
,
'
''
cried
Gavroche
,
``
they
say
`
nut
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
children
nestled
close
to
each
other
,
Gavroche
finished
*NL*
arranging
them
on
the
mat
,
drew
the
blanket
up
to
their
very
ears
,
then
*NL*
repeated
,
for
the
third
time
,
his
injunction
in
the
hieratical
tongue
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
your
peepers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
snuffed
out
his
tiny
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
the
light
been
extinguished
,
when
a
peculiar
trembling
began
*NL*
to
affect
the
netting
under
which
the
three
children
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
consisted
of
a
multitude
of
dull
scratches
which
produced
a
metallic
*NL*
sound
,
as
if
claws
and
teeth
were
gnawing
at
the
copper
wire
.
This
was
*NL*
accompanied
by
all
sorts
of
little
piercing
cries
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
five-year-old
boy
,
on
hearing
this
hubbub
overhead
,
and
*NL*
chilled
with
terror
,
jogged
his
brother
's
elbow
;
but
the
elder
brother
*NL*
had
already
shut
his
peepers
,
as
Gavroche
had
ordered
.
Then
the
little
*NL*
one
,
who
could
no
longer
control
his
terror
,
questioned
Gavroche
,
but
in
*NL*
a
very
low
tone
,
and
with
bated
breath
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
said
Gavroche
,
who
had
just
closed
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
rats
,
''
replied
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
laid
his
head
down
on
the
mat
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rats
,
in
fact
,
who
swarmed
by
thousands
in
the
carcass
of
the
*NL*
elephant
,
and
who
were
the
living
black
spots
which
we
have
already
*NL*
mentioned
,
had
been
held
in
awe
by
the
flame
of
the
candle
,
so
long
as
*NL*
it
had
been
lighted
;
but
as
soon
as
the
cavern
,
which
was
the
same
*NL*
as
their
city
,
had
returned
to
darkness
,
scenting
what
the
good
*NL*
story-teller
Perrault
calls
``
fresh
meat
,
''
they
had
hurled
themselves
in
*NL*
throngs
on
Gavroche
's
tent
,
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
it
,
and
had
begun
*NL*
to
bite
the
meshes
as
though
seeking
to
pierce
this
new-fangled
trap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
the
little
one
could
not
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
?
''
he
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
rats
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
mice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
reassured
the
child
a
little
.
He
had
seen
white
mice
in
*NL*
the
course
of
his
life
,
and
he
was
not
afraid
of
them
.
Nevertheless
,
he
*NL*
lifted
up
his
voice
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
said
Gavroche
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
have
a
cat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
have
one
,
''
replied
Gavroche
,
``
I
brought
one
here
,
but
they
ate
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
second
explanation
undid
the
work
of
the
first
,
and
the
little
*NL*
fellow
began
to
tremble
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dialogue
between
him
and
Gavroche
began
again
for
the
fourth
time
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
it
that
was
eaten
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
who
ate
the
cat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
rats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
,
in
consternation
,
dismayed
at
the
thought
of
mice
which
ate
*NL*
cats
,
pursued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
would
those
mice
eat
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
they
just
!
''
ejaculated
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
's
terror
had
reached
its
climax
.
But
Gavroche
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
afraid
.
They
ca
n't
get
in
.
And
besides
,
I
'm
here
!
Here
,
catch
*NL*
hold
of
my
hand
.
Hold
your
tongue
and
shut
your
peepers
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
Gavroche
grasped
the
little
fellow
's
hand
across
his
*NL*
brother
.
The
child
pressed
the
hand
close
to
him
,
and
felt
reassured
.
*NL*
Courage
and
strength
have
these
mysterious
ways
of
communicating
*NL*
themselves
.
Silence
reigned
round
them
once
more
,
the
sound
of
their
*NL*
voices
had
frightened
off
the
rats
;
at
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
they
came
raging
back
,
but
in
vain
,
the
three
little
fellows
were
fast
*NL*
asleep
and
heard
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hours
of
the
night
fled
away
.
Darkness
covered
the
vast
Place
de
la
*NL*
Bastille
.
A
wintry
gale
,
which
mingled
with
the
rain
,
blew
in
gusts
,
the
*NL*
patrol
searched
all
the
doorways
,
alleys
,
enclosures
,
and
obscure
nooks
,
*NL*
and
in
their
search
for
nocturnal
vagabonds
they
passed
in
silence
*NL*
before
the
elephant
;
the
monster
,
erect
,
motionless
,
staring
open-eyed
*NL*
into
the
shadows
,
had
the
appearance
of
dreaming
happily
over
his
good
*NL*
deed
;
and
sheltered
from
heaven
and
from
men
the
three
poor
sleeping
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
understand
what
is
about
to
follow
,
the
reader
must
*NL*
remember
,
that
,
at
that
epoch
,
the
Bastille
guard-house
was
situated
at
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
square
,
and
that
what
took
place
in
the
vicinity
of
*NL*
the
elephant
could
neither
be
seen
nor
heard
by
the
sentinel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
end
of
that
hour
which
immediately
precedes
the
dawn
,
a
*NL*
man
turned
from
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
at
a
run
,
made
the
circuit
of
the
*NL*
enclosure
of
the
column
of
July
,
and
glided
between
the
palings
until
he
*NL*
was
underneath
the
belly
of
the
elephant
.
If
any
light
had
illuminated
*NL*
that
man
,
it
might
have
been
divined
from
the
thorough
manner
in
which
*NL*
he
was
soaked
that
he
had
passed
the
night
in
the
rain
.
Arrived
beneath
*NL*
the
elephant
,
he
uttered
a
peculiar
cry
,
which
did
not
belong
to
any
*NL*
human
tongue
,
and
which
a
paroquet
alone
could
have
imitated
.
Twice
he
*NL*
repeated
this
cry
,
of
whose
orthography
the
following
barely
conveys
an
*NL*
idea
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Kirikikiou
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
second
cry
,
a
clear
,
young
,
merry
voice
responded
from
the
belly
*NL*
of
the
elephant
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
immediately
,
the
plank
which
closed
the
hole
was
drawn
aside
,
*NL*
and
gave
passage
to
a
child
who
descended
the
elephant
's
leg
,
and
fell
*NL*
briskly
near
the
man
.
It
was
Gavroche
.
The
man
was
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
his
cry
of
Kirikikiou
,
--
that
was
,
doubtless
,
what
the
child
had
*NL*
meant
,
when
he
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
ask
for
Monsieur
Gavroche
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
it
,
he
had
waked
with
a
start
,
had
crawled
out
of
his
*NL*
``
alcove
,
''
pushing
apart
the
netting
a
little
,
and
carefully
drawing
it
*NL*
together
again
,
then
he
had
opened
the
trap
,
and
descended
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
and
the
child
recognized
each
other
silently
amid
the
gloom
:
*NL*
Montparnasse
confined
himself
to
the
remark
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
need
you
.
Come
,
lend
us
a
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lad
asked
for
no
further
enlightenment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
with
you
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
both
took
their
way
towards
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
,
whence
*NL*
Montparnasse
had
emerged
,
winding
rapidly
through
the
long
file
of
*NL*
market-gardeners
'
carts
which
descend
towards
the
markets
at
that
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
market-gardeners
,
crouching
,
half-asleep
,
in
their
wagons
,
amid
the
*NL*
salads
and
vegetables
,
enveloped
to
their
very
eyes
in
their
mufflers
*NL*
on
account
of
the
beating
rain
,
did
not
even
glance
at
these
strange
*NL*
pedestrians
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
VICISSITUDES
OF
FLIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
had
taken
place
that
same
night
at
the
La
Force
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
An
escape
had
been
planned
between
Babet
,
Brujon
,
Guelemer
,
and
*NL*
Thenardier
,
although
Thenardier
was
in
close
confinement
.
Babet
had
*NL*
arranged
the
matter
for
his
own
benefit
,
on
the
same
day
,
as
the
reader
*NL*
has
seen
from
Montparnasse
's
account
to
Gavroche
.
Montparnasse
was
to
*NL*
help
them
from
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brujon
,
after
having
passed
a
month
in
the
punishment
cell
,
had
had
*NL*
time
,
in
the
first
place
,
to
weave
a
rope
,
in
the
second
,
to
mature
a
*NL*
plan
.
In
former
times
,
those
severe
places
where
the
discipline
of
the
*NL*
prison
delivers
the
convict
into
his
own
hands
,
were
composed
of
four
*NL*
stone
walls
,
a
stone
ceiling
,
a
flagged
pavement
,
a
camp
bed
,
a
grated
*NL*
window
,
and
a
door
lined
with
iron
,
and
were
called
dungeons
;
but
the
*NL*
dungeon
was
judged
to
be
too
terrible
;
nowadays
they
are
composed
of
an
*NL*
iron
door
,
a
grated
window
,
a
camp
bed
,
a
flagged
pavement
,
four
stone
*NL*
walls
,
and
a
stone
ceiling
,
and
are
called
chambers
of
punishment
.
A
*NL*
little
light
penetrates
towards
mid-day
.
The
inconvenient
point
about
*NL*
these
chambers
which
,
as
the
reader
sees
,
are
not
dungeons
,
is
that
they
*NL*
allow
the
persons
who
should
be
at
work
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Brujon
meditated
,
and
he
emerged
from
the
chamber
of
punishment
with
*NL*
a
rope
.
As
he
had
the
name
of
being
very
dangerous
in
the
Charlemagne
*NL*
courtyard
,
he
was
placed
in
the
New
Building
.
The
first
thing
he
found
*NL*
in
the
New
Building
was
Guelemer
,
the
second
was
a
nail
;
Guelemer
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
crime
;
a
nail
,
that
is
to
say
,
liberty
.
Brujon
,
of
whom
it
*NL*
is
high
time
that
the
reader
should
have
a
complete
idea
,
was
,
with
an
*NL*
appearance
of
delicate
health
and
a
profoundly
premeditated
languor
,
a
*NL*
polished
,
intelligent
sprig
,
and
a
thief
,
who
had
a
caressing
glance
,
*NL*
and
an
atrocious
smile
.
His
glance
resulted
from
his
will
,
and
his
*NL*
smile
from
his
nature
.
His
first
studies
in
his
art
had
been
directed
*NL*
to
roofs
.
He
had
made
great
progress
in
the
industry
of
the
men
who
tear
*NL*
off
lead
,
who
plunder
the
roofs
and
despoil
the
gutters
by
the
process
*NL*
called
double
pickings
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstance
which
put
the
finishing
touch
on
the
moment
peculiarly
*NL*
favorable
for
an
attempt
at
escape
,
was
that
the
roofers
were
re-laying
*NL*
and
re-jointing
,
at
that
very
moment
,
a
portion
of
the
slates
on
the
*NL*
prison
.
The
Saint-Bernard
courtyard
was
no
longer
absolutely
isolated
*NL*
from
the
Charlemagne
and
the
Saint-Louis
courts
.
Up
above
there
were
*NL*
scaffoldings
and
ladders
;
in
other
words
,
bridges
and
stairs
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
New
Building
,
which
was
the
most
cracked
and
decrepit
thing
to
be
*NL*
seen
anywhere
in
the
world
,
was
the
weak
point
in
the
prison
.
The
walls
*NL*
were
eaten
by
saltpetre
to
such
an
extent
that
the
authorities
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
line
the
vaults
of
the
dormitories
with
a
sheathing
of
wood
,
*NL*
because
stones
were
in
the
habit
of
becoming
detached
and
falling
on
*NL*
the
prisoners
in
their
beds
.
In
spite
of
this
antiquity
,
the
authorities
*NL*
committed
the
error
of
confining
in
the
New
Building
the
most
*NL*
troublesome
prisoners
,
of
placing
there
``
the
hard
cases
,
''
as
they
say
in
*NL*
prison
parlance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
New
Building
contained
four
dormitories
,
one
above
the
other
,
and
a
*NL*
top
story
which
was
called
the
Bel-Air
-LRB-
Fine
Air
-RRB-
.
A
large
chimney-flue
,
*NL*
probably
from
some
ancient
kitchen
of
the
Dukes
de
la
Force
,
started
*NL*
from
the
groundfloor
,
traversed
all
four
stories
,
cut
the
dormitories
,
*NL*
where
it
figured
as
a
flattened
pillar
,
into
two
portions
,
and
finally
*NL*
pierced
the
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guelemer
and
Brujon
were
in
the
same
dormitory
.
They
had
been
placed
,
by
*NL*
way
of
precaution
,
on
the
lower
story
.
Chance
ordained
that
the
heads
of
*NL*
their
beds
should
rest
against
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
directly
over
their
heads
in
the
top
story
known
as
*NL*
Fine-Air
.
The
pedestrian
who
halts
on
the
Rue
Culture-Sainte-Catherine
,
*NL*
after
passing
the
barracks
of
the
firemen
,
in
front
of
the
porte-cochere
*NL*
of
the
bathing
establishment
,
beholds
a
yard
full
of
flowers
and
shrubs
*NL*
in
wooden
boxes
,
at
the
extremity
of
which
spreads
out
a
little
white
*NL*
rotunda
with
two
wings
,
brightened
up
with
green
shutters
,
the
bucolic
*NL*
dream
of
Jean
Jacques
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
more
than
ten
years
ago
,
there
rose
above
that
rotunda
an
enormous
*NL*
black
,
hideous
,
bare
wall
by
which
it
was
backed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
outer
wall
of
La
Force
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
wall
,
beside
that
rotunda
,
was
Milton
viewed
through
Berquin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lofty
as
it
was
,
this
wall
was
overtopped
by
a
still
blacker
roof
,
which
*NL*
could
be
seen
beyond
.
This
was
the
roof
of
the
New
Building
.
There
*NL*
one
could
descry
four
dormer-windows
,
guarded
with
bars
;
they
were
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
Fine-Air
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
chimney
pierced
the
roof
;
this
was
the
chimney
which
traversed
the
*NL*
dormitories
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bel-Air
,
that
top
story
of
the
New
Building
,
was
a
sort
of
large
*NL*
hall
,
with
a
Mansard
roof
,
guarded
with
triple
gratings
and
double
doors
*NL*
of
sheet
iron
,
which
were
studded
with
enormous
bolts
.
When
one
entered
*NL*
from
the
north
end
,
one
had
on
one
's
left
the
four
dormer-windows
,
on
*NL*
one
's
right
,
facing
the
windows
,
at
regular
intervals
,
four
square
,
*NL*
tolerably
vast
cages
,
separated
by
narrow
passages
,
built
of
masonry
*NL*
to
about
the
height
of
the
elbow
,
and
the
rest
,
up
to
the
roof
,
of
iron
*NL*
bars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
had
been
in
solitary
confinement
in
one
of
these
cages
since
*NL*
the
night
of
the
3d
of
February
.
No
one
was
ever
able
to
discover
how
,
*NL*
and
by
what
connivance
,
he
succeeded
in
procuring
,
and
secreting
a
*NL*
bottle
of
wine
,
invented
,
so
it
is
said
,
by
Desrues
,
with
which
*NL*
a
narcotic
is
mixed
,
and
which
the
band
of
the
Endormeurs
,
or
*NL*
Sleep-compellers
,
rendered
famous
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
,
in
many
prisons
,
treacherous
employees
,
half-jailers
,
*NL*
half-thieves
,
who
assist
in
escapes
,
who
sell
to
the
police
an
*NL*
unfaithful
service
,
and
who
turn
a
penny
whenever
they
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
same
night
,
then
,
when
Little
Gavroche
picked
up
the
two
lost
*NL*
children
,
Brujon
and
Guelemer
,
who
knew
that
Babet
,
who
had
escaped
that
*NL*
morning
,
was
waiting
for
them
in
the
street
as
well
as
Montparnasse
,
*NL*
rose
softly
,
and
with
the
nail
which
Brujon
had
found
,
began
to
pierce
*NL*
the
chimney
against
which
their
beds
stood
.
The
rubbish
fell
on
Brujon
's
*NL*
bed
,
so
that
they
were
not
heard
.
Showers
mingled
with
thunder
shook
*NL*
the
doors
on
their
hinges
,
and
created
in
the
prison
a
terrible
and
*NL*
opportune
uproar
.
Those
of
the
prisoners
who
woke
,
pretended
to
fall
*NL*
asleep
again
,
and
left
Guelemer
and
Brujon
to
their
own
devices
.
Brujon
*NL*
was
adroit
;
Guelemer
was
vigorous
.
Before
any
sound
had
reached
the
*NL*
watcher
,
who
was
sleeping
in
the
grated
cell
which
opened
into
the
*NL*
dormitory
,
the
wall
had
,
been
pierced
,
the
chimney
scaled
,
the
iron
*NL*
grating
which
barred
the
upper
orifice
of
the
flue
forced
,
and
the
two
*NL*
redoubtable
ruffians
were
on
the
roof
.
The
wind
and
rain
redoubled
,
the
*NL*
roof
was
slippery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
good
night
to
leg
it
!
''
said
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
abyss
six
feet
broad
and
eighty
feet
deep
separated
them
from
the
*NL*
surrounding
wall
.
At
the
bottom
of
this
abyss
,
they
could
see
the
musket
*NL*
of
a
sentinel
gleaming
through
the
gloom
.
They
fastened
one
end
of
the
*NL*
rope
which
Brujon
had
spun
in
his
dungeon
to
the
stumps
of
the
iron
bars
*NL*
which
they
had
just
wrenched
off
,
flung
the
other
over
the
outer
wall
,
*NL*
crossed
the
abyss
at
one
bound
,
clung
to
the
coping
of
the
wall
,
got
*NL*
astride
of
it
,
let
themselves
slip
,
one
after
the
other
,
along
the
rope
,
*NL*
upon
a
little
roof
which
touches
the
bath-house
,
pulled
their
rope
after
*NL*
them
,
jumped
down
into
the
courtyard
of
the
bath-house
,
traversed
it
,
*NL*
pushed
open
the
porter
's
wicket
,
beside
which
hung
his
rope
,
pulled
*NL*
this
,
opened
the
porte-cochere
,
and
found
themselves
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three-quarters
of
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
since
they
had
risen
in
bed
in
*NL*
the
dark
,
nail
in
hand
,
and
their
project
in
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
they
had
joined
Babet
and
Montparnasse
,
who
were
*NL*
prowling
about
the
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
broken
their
rope
in
pulling
it
after
them
,
and
a
bit
of
it
*NL*
remained
attached
to
the
chimney
on
the
roof
.
They
had
sustained
no
*NL*
other
damage
,
however
,
than
that
of
scratching
nearly
all
the
skin
off
*NL*
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
Thenardier
was
warned
,
without
any
one
being
able
to
explain
*NL*
how
,
and
was
not
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
night
being
very
dark
,
he
saw
*NL*
two
shadows
pass
along
the
roof
,
in
the
rain
and
squalls
,
in
front
of
*NL*
the
dormer-window
which
was
opposite
his
cage
.
One
halted
at
the
window
,
*NL*
long
enough
to
dart
in
a
glance
.
This
was
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
recognized
him
,
and
understood
.
This
was
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
rated
as
a
burglar
,
and
detained
as
a
measure
of
precaution
*NL*
under
the
charge
of
organizing
a
nocturnal
ambush
,
with
armed
force
,
was
*NL*
kept
in
sight
.
The
sentry
,
who
was
relieved
every
two
hours
,
marched
*NL*
up
and
down
in
front
of
his
cage
with
loaded
musket
.
The
Fine-Air
was
*NL*
lighted
by
a
skylight
.
The
prisoner
had
on
his
feet
fetters
weighing
*NL*
fifty
pounds
.
Every
day
,
at
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
a
jailer
,
*NL*
escorted
by
two
dogs
,
--
this
was
still
in
vogue
at
that
time
,
--
entered
*NL*
his
cage
,
deposited
beside
his
bed
a
loaf
of
black
bread
weighing
two
*NL*
pounds
,
a
jug
of
water
,
a
bowl
filled
with
rather
thin
bouillon
,
in
*NL*
which
swam
a
few
Mayagan
beans
,
inspected
his
irons
and
tapped
the
bars
.
*NL*
This
man
and
his
dogs
made
two
visits
during
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
had
obtained
permission
to
keep
a
sort
of
iron
bolt
which
he
*NL*
used
to
spike
his
bread
into
a
crack
in
the
wall
,
``
in
order
to
preserve
*NL*
it
from
the
rats
,
''
as
he
said
.
As
Thenardier
was
kept
in
sight
,
*NL*
no
objection
had
been
made
to
this
spike
.
Still
,
it
was
remembered
*NL*
afterwards
,
that
one
of
the
jailers
had
said
:
``
It
would
be
better
to
let
*NL*
him
have
only
a
wooden
spike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
sentinel
,
who
was
an
old
soldier
,
was
*NL*
relieved
,
and
replaced
by
a
conscript
.
A
few
moments
later
,
the
man
with
*NL*
the
dogs
paid
his
visit
,
and
went
off
without
noticing
anything
,
except
,
*NL*
possibly
,
the
excessive
youth
and
``
the
rustic
air
''
of
the
``
raw
recruit
.
''
*NL*
Two
hours
afterwards
,
at
four
o'clock
,
when
they
came
to
relieve
the
*NL*
conscript
,
he
was
found
asleep
on
the
floor
,
lying
like
a
log
near
*NL*
Thenardier
's
cage
.
As
for
Thenardier
,
he
was
no
longer
there
.
There
was
*NL*
a
hole
in
the
ceiling
of
his
cage
,
and
,
above
it
,
another
hole
in
the
*NL*
roof
.
One
of
the
planks
of
his
bed
had
been
wrenched
off
,
and
probably
*NL*
carried
away
with
him
,
as
it
was
not
found
.
They
also
seized
in
his
cell
*NL*
a
half-empty
bottle
which
contained
the
remains
of
the
stupefying
wine
*NL*
with
which
the
soldier
had
been
drugged
.
The
soldier
's
bayonet
had
*NL*
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
this
discovery
was
made
,
it
was
assumed
that
*NL*
Thenardier
was
out
of
reach
.
The
truth
is
,
that
he
was
no
longer
in
the
*NL*
New
Building
,
but
that
he
was
still
in
great
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
on
reaching
the
roof
of
the
New
Building
,
had
found
the
*NL*
remains
of
Brujon
's
rope
hanging
to
the
bars
of
the
upper
trap
of
the
*NL*
chimney
,
but
,
as
this
broken
fragment
was
much
too
short
,
he
had
not
*NL*
been
able
to
escape
by
the
outer
wall
,
as
Brujon
and
Guelemer
had
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
turns
from
the
Rue
des
Ballets
into
the
Rue
du
Roi-de-Sicile
,
*NL*
one
almost
immediately
encounters
a
repulsive
ruin
.
There
stood
on
*NL*
that
spot
,
in
the
last
century
,
a
house
of
which
only
the
back
wall
now
*NL*
remains
,
a
regular
wall
of
masonry
,
which
rises
to
the
height
of
the
*NL*
third
story
between
the
adjoining
buildings
.
This
ruin
can
be
recognized
*NL*
by
two
large
square
windows
which
are
still
to
be
seen
there
;
the
middle
*NL*
one
,
that
nearest
the
right
gable
,
is
barred
with
a
worm-eaten
beam
*NL*
adjusted
like
a
prop
.
Through
these
windows
there
was
formerly
visible
a
*NL*
lofty
and
lugubrious
wall
,
which
was
a
fragment
of
the
outer
wall
of
La
*NL*
Force
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
empty
space
on
the
street
left
by
the
demolished
house
is
*NL*
half-filled
by
a
fence
of
rotten
boards
,
shored
up
by
five
stone
posts
.
*NL*
In
this
recess
lies
concealed
a
little
shanty
which
leans
against
the
*NL*
portion
of
the
ruin
which
has
remained
standing
.
The
fence
has
a
gate
,
*NL*
which
,
a
few
years
ago
,
was
fastened
only
by
a
latch
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
crest
of
this
ruin
that
Thenardier
had
succeeded
in
reaching
,
*NL*
a
little
after
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
had
he
got
there
?
That
is
what
no
one
has
ever
been
able
to
explain
*NL*
or
understand
.
The
lightning
must
,
at
the
same
time
,
have
hindered
*NL*
and
helped
him
.
Had
he
made
use
of
the
ladders
and
scaffoldings
of
the
*NL*
slaters
to
get
from
roof
to
roof
,
from
enclosure
to
enclosure
,
from
*NL*
compartment
to
compartment
,
to
the
buildings
of
the
Charlemagne
court
,
*NL*
then
to
the
buildings
of
the
Saint-Louis
court
,
to
the
outer
wall
,
and
*NL*
thence
to
the
hut
on
the
Rue
du
Roi-de-Sicile
?
But
in
that
itinerary
*NL*
there
existed
breaks
which
seemed
to
render
it
an
impossibility
.
Had
*NL*
he
placed
the
plank
from
his
bed
like
a
bridge
from
the
roof
of
the
*NL*
Fine-Air
to
the
outer
wall
,
and
crawled
flat
,
on
his
belly
on
the
coping
*NL*
of
the
outer
wall
the
whole
distance
round
the
prison
as
far
as
the
hut
?
*NL*
But
the
outer
wall
of
La
Force
formed
a
crenellated
and
unequal
line
;
*NL*
it
mounted
and
descended
,
it
dropped
at
the
firemen
's
barracks
,
it
rose
*NL*
towards
the
bath-house
,
it
was
cut
in
twain
by
buildings
,
it
was
not
*NL*
even
of
the
same
height
on
the
Hotel
Lamoignon
as
on
the
Rue
Pavee
;
*NL*
everywhere
occurred
falls
and
right
angles
;
and
then
,
the
sentinels
must
*NL*
have
espied
the
dark
form
of
the
fugitive
;
hence
,
the
route
taken
by
*NL*
Thenardier
still
remains
rather
inexplicable
.
In
two
manners
,
flight
was
*NL*
impossible
.
Had
Thenardier
,
spurred
on
by
that
thirst
for
liberty
which
*NL*
changes
precipices
into
ditches
,
iron
bars
into
wattles
of
osier
,
a
*NL*
legless
man
into
an
athlete
,
a
gouty
man
into
a
bird
,
stupidity
into
*NL*
instinct
,
instinct
into
intelligence
,
and
intelligence
into
genius
,
had
*NL*
Thenardier
invented
a
third
mode
?
No
one
has
ever
found
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marvels
of
escape
can
not
always
be
accounted
for
.
The
man
who
makes
*NL*
his
escape
,
we
repeat
,
is
inspired
;
there
is
something
of
the
star
and
*NL*
of
the
lightning
in
the
mysterious
gleam
of
flight
;
the
effort
towards
*NL*
deliverance
is
no
less
surprising
than
the
flight
towards
the
sublime
,
*NL*
and
one
says
of
the
escaped
thief
:
``
How
did
he
contrive
to
scale
that
*NL*
wall
?
''
in
the
same
way
that
one
says
of
Corneille
:
``
Where
did
he
find
*NL*
the
means
of
dying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
all
events
,
dripping
with
perspiration
,
drenched
with
rain
,
with
his
*NL*
clothes
hanging
in
ribbons
,
his
hands
flayed
,
his
elbows
bleeding
,
his
*NL*
knees
torn
,
Thenardier
had
reached
what
children
,
in
their
figurative
*NL*
language
,
call
the
edge
of
the
wall
of
the
ruin
,
there
he
had
stretched
*NL*
himself
out
at
full
length
,
and
there
his
strength
had
failed
him
.
A
*NL*
steep
escarpment
three
stories
high
separated
him
from
the
pavement
of
*NL*
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rope
which
he
had
was
too
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
waited
,
pale
,
exhausted
,
desperate
with
all
the
despair
which
*NL*
he
had
undergone
,
still
hidden
by
the
night
,
but
telling
himself
that
*NL*
the
day
was
on
the
point
of
dawning
,
alarmed
at
the
idea
of
hearing
the
*NL*
neighboring
clock
of
Saint-Paul
strike
four
within
a
few
minutes
,
an
*NL*
hour
when
the
sentinel
was
relieved
and
when
the
latter
would
be
found
*NL*
asleep
under
the
pierced
roof
,
staring
in
horror
at
a
terrible
depth
,
at
*NL*
the
light
of
the
street
lanterns
,
the
wet
,
black
pavement
,
that
pavement
*NL*
longed
for
yet
frightful
,
which
meant
death
,
and
which
meant
liberty
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
asked
himself
whether
his
three
accomplices
in
flight
had
succeeded
,
*NL*
if
they
had
heard
him
,
and
if
they
would
come
to
his
assistance
.
He
*NL*
listened
.
With
the
exception
of
the
patrol
,
no
one
had
passed
through
*NL*
the
street
since
he
had
been
there
.
Nearly
the
whole
of
the
descent
of
*NL*
the
market-gardeners
from
Montreuil
,
from
Charonne
,
from
Vincennes
,
*NL*
and
from
Bercy
to
the
markets
was
accomplished
through
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Antoine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
o'clock
struck
.
Thenardier
shuddered
.
A
few
moments
later
,
that
*NL*
terrified
and
confused
uproar
which
follows
the
discovery
of
an
escape
*NL*
broke
forth
in
the
prison
.
The
sound
of
doors
opening
and
shutting
,
the
*NL*
creaking
of
gratings
on
their
hinges
,
a
tumult
in
the
guard-house
,
the
*NL*
hoarse
shouts
of
the
turnkeys
,
the
shock
of
musket-butts
on
the
pavement
*NL*
of
the
courts
,
reached
his
ears
.
Lights
ascended
and
descended
past
the
*NL*
grated
windows
of
the
dormitories
,
a
torch
ran
along
the
ridge-pole
of
*NL*
the
top
story
of
the
New
Building
,
the
firemen
belonging
in
the
barracks
*NL*
on
the
right
had
been
summoned
.
Their
helmets
,
which
the
torch
lighted
*NL*
up
in
the
rain
,
went
and
came
along
the
roofs
.
At
the
same
time
,
*NL*
Thenardier
perceived
in
the
direction
of
the
Bastille
a
wan
whiteness
*NL*
lighting
up
the
edge
of
the
sky
in
doleful
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
top
of
a
wall
ten
inches
wide
,
stretched
out
under
the
heavy
*NL*
rains
,
with
two
gulfs
to
right
and
left
,
unable
to
stir
,
subject
to
the
*NL*
giddiness
of
a
possible
fall
,
and
to
the
horror
of
a
certain
arrest
,
*NL*
and
his
thoughts
,
like
the
pendulum
of
a
clock
,
swung
from
one
of
these
*NL*
ideas
to
the
other
:
``
Dead
if
I
fall
,
caught
if
I
stay
.
''
In
the
midst
of
*NL*
this
anguish
,
he
suddenly
saw
,
the
street
being
still
dark
,
a
man
who
*NL*
was
gliding
along
the
walls
and
coming
from
the
Rue
Pavee
,
halt
in
the
*NL*
recess
above
which
Thenardier
was
,
as
it
were
,
suspended
.
Here
this
*NL*
man
was
joined
by
a
second
,
who
walked
with
the
same
caution
,
then
by
*NL*
a
third
,
then
by
a
fourth
.
When
these
men
were
re-united
,
one
of
them
*NL*
lifted
the
latch
of
the
gate
in
the
fence
,
and
all
four
entered
*NL*
the
enclosure
in
which
the
shanty
stood
.
They
halted
directly
under
*NL*
Thenardier
.
These
men
had
evidently
chosen
this
vacant
space
in
order
*NL*
that
they
might
consult
without
being
seen
by
the
passers-by
or
by
the
*NL*
sentinel
who
guards
the
wicket
of
La
Force
a
few
paces
distant
.
It
*NL*
must
be
added
,
that
the
rain
kept
this
sentinel
blocked
in
his
box
.
*NL*
Thenardier
,
not
being
able
to
distinguish
their
visages
,
lent
an
ear
to
*NL*
their
words
with
the
desperate
attention
of
a
wretch
who
feels
himself
*NL*
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
saw
something
resembling
a
gleam
of
hope
flash
before
his
*NL*
eyes
,
--
these
men
conversed
in
slang
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
said
in
a
low
but
distinct
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
cut
.
What
are
we
up
to
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
replied
:
``
It
's
raining
hard
enough
to
put
out
the
very
*NL*
devil
's
fire
.
And
the
bobbies
will
be
along
instanter
.
There
's
a
soldier
*NL*
on
guard
yonder
.
We
shall
get
nabbed
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
words
,
icigo
and
icicaille
,
both
of
which
mean
ici
,
and
which
*NL*
belong
,
the
first
to
the
slang
of
the
barriers
,
the
second
to
the
slang
*NL*
of
the
Temple
,
were
flashes
of
light
for
Thenardier
.
By
the
icigo
he
*NL*
recognized
Brujon
,
who
was
a
prowler
of
the
barriers
,
by
the
icicaille
*NL*
he
knew
Babet
,
who
,
among
his
other
trades
,
had
been
an
old-clothes
*NL*
broker
at
the
Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
antique
slang
of
the
great
century
is
no
longer
spoken
except
in
*NL*
the
Temple
,
and
Babet
was
really
the
only
person
who
spoke
it
in
all
*NL*
its
purity
.
Had
it
not
been
for
the
icicaille
,
Thenardier
would
not
have
*NL*
recognized
him
,
for
he
had
entirely
changed
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
third
man
had
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
hurry
yet
,
let
's
wait
a
bit
.
How
do
we
know
that
he
does
n't
*NL*
stand
in
need
of
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
,
which
was
nothing
but
French
,
Thenardier
recognized
*NL*
Montparnasse
,
who
made
it
a
point
in
his
elegance
to
understand
all
*NL*
slangs
and
to
speak
none
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
fourth
,
he
held
his
peace
,
but
his
huge
shoulders
betrayed
*NL*
him
.
Thenardier
did
not
hesitate
.
It
was
Guelemer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brujon
replied
almost
impetuously
but
still
in
a
low
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
jabbering
about
?
The
tavern-keeper
has
n't
managed
to
cut
*NL*
his
stick
.
He
do
n't
tumble
to
the
racket
,
that
he
do
n't
!
You
have
to
be
*NL*
a
pretty
knowing
cove
to
tear
up
your
shirt
,
cut
up
your
sheet
to
make
*NL*
a
rope
,
punch
holes
in
doors
,
get
up
false
papers
,
make
false
keys
,
file
*NL*
your
irons
,
hang
out
your
cord
,
hide
yourself
,
and
disguise
yourself
!
*NL*
The
old
fellow
has
n't
managed
to
play
it
,
he
does
n't
understand
how
to
*NL*
work
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Babet
added
,
still
in
that
classical
slang
which
was
spoken
by
*NL*
Poulailler
and
Cartouche
,
and
which
is
to
the
bold
,
new
,
highly
colored
*NL*
and
risky
argot
used
by
Brujon
what
the
language
of
Racine
is
to
the
*NL*
language
of
Andre
Chenier
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
tavern-keeper
must
have
been
nabbed
in
the
act
.
You
have
to
be
*NL*
knowing
.
He
's
only
a
greenhorn
.
He
must
have
let
himself
be
taken
in
*NL*
by
a
bobby
,
perhaps
even
by
a
sheep
who
played
it
on
him
as
his
pal
.
*NL*
Listen
,
Montparnasse
,
do
you
hear
those
shouts
in
the
prison
?
You
have
*NL*
seen
all
those
lights
.
He
's
recaptured
,
there
!
He
'll
get
off
with
twenty
*NL*
years
.
I
ai
n't
afraid
,
I
ai
n't
a
coward
,
but
there
ai
n't
anything
more
*NL*
to
do
,
or
otherwise
they
'd
lead
us
a
dance
.
Do
n't
get
mad
,
come
with
us
,
*NL*
let
's
go
drink
a
bottle
of
old
wine
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
does
n't
desert
one
's
friends
in
a
scrape
,
''
grumbled
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
he
's
nabbed
!
''
retorted
Brujon
.
``
At
the
present
moment
,
the
*NL*
inn-keeper
ai
n't
worth
a
ha
`
penny

We
ca
n't
do
nothing
for
him
.
Let
's
be
*NL*
off
.
Every
minute
I
think
a
bobby
has
got
me
in
his
fist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
no
longer
offered
more
than
a
feeble
resistance
;
the
fact
*NL*
is
,
that
these
four
men
,
with
the
fidelity
of
ruffians
who
never
abandon
*NL*
each
other
,
had
prowled
all
night
long
about
La
Force
,
great
as
was
*NL*
their
peril
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
Thenardier
make
his
appearance
on
the
*NL*
top
of
some
wall
.
But
the
night
,
which
was
really
growing
too
fine
,
--
for
*NL*
the
downpour
was
such
as
to
render
all
the
streets
deserted
,
--
the
cold
*NL*
which
was
overpowering
them
,
their
soaked
garments
,
their
hole-ridden
*NL*
shoes
,
the
alarming
noise
which
had
just
burst
forth
in
the
prison
,
the
*NL*
hours
which
had
elapsed
,
the
patrol
which
they
had
encountered
,
the
*NL*
hope
which
was
vanishing
,
all
urged
them
to
beat
a
retreat
.
Montparnasse
*NL*
himself
,
who
was
,
perhaps
,
almost
Thenardier
's
son-in-law
,
yielded
.
A
*NL*
moment
more
,
and
they
would
be
gone
.
Thenardier
was
panting
on
his
wall
*NL*
like
the
shipwrecked
sufferers
of
the
Meduse
on
their
raft
when
they
*NL*
beheld
the
vessel
which
had
appeared
in
sight
vanish
on
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
dared
not
call
to
them
;
a
cry
might
be
heard
and
ruin
everything
.
An
*NL*
idea
occurred
to
him
,
a
last
idea
,
a
flash
of
inspiration
;
he
drew
from
*NL*
his
pocket
the
end
of
Brujon
's
rope
,
which
he
had
detached
from
the
*NL*
chimney
of
the
New
Building
,
and
flung
it
into
the
space
enclosed
by
the
*NL*
fence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rope
fell
at
their
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
widow
,
''
-LSB-
37
-RSB-
said
Babet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
tortouse
!
''
-LSB-
38
-RSB-
said
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tavern-keeper
is
there
,
''
said
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
raised
their
eyes
.
Thenardier
thrust
out
his
head
a
very
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
!
''
said
Montparnasse
,
``
have
you
the
other
end
of
the
rope
,
*NL*
Brujon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knot
the

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
ran
the
risk
,
and
spoke
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
paralyzed
with
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
warm
you
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
budge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
yourself
slide
,
we
'll
catch
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
hands
are
benumbed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
fasten
the
rope
to
the
wall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
one
of
us
must
climb
up
,
''
said
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three
stories
!
''
ejaculated
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ancient
plaster
flue
,
which
had
served
for
a
stove
that
had
been
used
*NL*
in
the
shanty
in
former
times
,
ran
along
the
wall
and
mounted
almost
*NL*
to
the
very
spot
where
they
could
see
Thenardier
.
This
flue
,
then
much
*NL*
damaged
and
full
of
cracks
,
has
since
fallen
,
but
the
marks
of
it
are
*NL*
still
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
narrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
might
get
up
by
the
help
of
that
,
''
said
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
that
flue
?
''
exclaimed
Babet
,
``
a
grown-up
cove
,
never
!
it
would
take
*NL*
a
brat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brat
must
be
got
,
''
resumed
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
to
find
a
young
`
un
?
''
said
Guelemer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
said
Montparnasse
.
``
I
've
got
the
very
article
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
gate
of
the
fence
very
softly
,
made
sure
that
no
one
was
*NL*
passing
along
the
street
,
stepped
out
cautiously
,
shut
the
gate
behind
*NL*
him
,
and
set
off
at
a
run
in
the
direction
of
the
Bastille
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
or
eight
minutes
elapsed
,
eight
thousand
centuries
to
Thenardier
;
*NL*
Babet
,
Brujon
,
and
Guelemer
did
not
open
their
lips
;
at
last
the
gate
*NL*
opened
once
more
,
and
Montparnasse
appeared
,
breathless
,
and
followed
by
*NL*
Gavroche
.
The
rain
still
rendered
the
street
completely
deserted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Gavroche
entered
the
enclosure
and
gazed
at
the
forms
of
these
*NL*
ruffians
with
a
tranquil
air
.
The
water
was
dripping
from
his
hair
.
*NL*
Guelemer
addressed
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
man
,
young
`
un
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
shrugged
his
shoulders
,
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
young
`
un
like
me
's
a
man
,
and
men
like
you
are
babes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
brat
's
tongue
's
well
hung
!
''
exclaimed
Babet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Paris
brat
ai
n't
made
of
straw
,
''
added
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
asked
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Montparnasse
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Climb
up
that
flue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
rope
,
''
said
Babet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
fasten
it
,
''
continued
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
top
of
the
wall
,
''
went
on
Babet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
cross-bar
of
the
window
,
''
added
Brujon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
?
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Guelemer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
examined
the
rope
,
the
flue
,
the
wall
,
the
windows
,
and
made
*NL*
that
indescribable
and
disdainful
noise
with
his
lips
which
signifies
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
man
up
there
whom
you
are
to
save
,
''
resumed
Montparnasse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
?
''
began
Brujon
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Greenhorn
!
''
replied
the
lad
,
as
though
the
question
appeared
a
most
*NL*
unprecedented
one
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
took
off
his
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guelemer
seized
Gavroche
by
one
arm
,
set
him
on
the
roof
of
the
shanty
,
*NL*
whose
worm-eaten
planks
bent
beneath
the
urchin
's
weight
,
and
handed
*NL*
him
the
rope
which
Brujon
had
knotted
together
during
Montparnasse
's
*NL*
absence
.
The
gamin
directed
his
steps
towards
the
flue
,
which
it
was
*NL*
easy
to
enter
,
thanks
to
a
large
crack
which
touched
the
roof
.
At
the
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
on
the
point
of
ascending
,
Thenardier
,
who
saw
life
*NL*
and
safety
approaching
,
bent
over
the
edge
of
the
wall
;
the
first
light
*NL*
of
dawn
struck
white
upon
his
brow
dripping
with
sweat
,
upon
his
livid
*NL*
cheek-bones
,
his
sharp
and
savage
nose
,
his
bristling
gray
beard
,
and
*NL*
Gavroche
recognized
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
it
's
my
father
!
Oh
,
that
wo
n't
hinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
taking
the
rope
in
his
teeth
,
he
resolutely
began
the
ascent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
summit
of
the
hut
,
bestrode
the
old
wall
as
though
it
had
*NL*
been
a
horse
,
and
knotted
the
rope
firmly
to
the
upper
cross-bar
of
the
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
Thenardier
was
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
touched
the
pavement
,
as
soon
as
he
found
himself
out
*NL*
of
danger
,
he
was
no
longer
either
weary
,
or
chilled
or
trembling
;
the
*NL*
terrible
things
from
which
he
had
escaped
vanished
like
smoke
,
all
that
*NL*
strange
and
ferocious
mind
awoke
once
more
,
and
stood
erect
and
free
,
*NL*
ready
to
march
onward
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
this
man
's
first
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
whom
are
we
to
eat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
useless
to
explain
the
sense
of
this
frightfully
transparent
*NL*
remark
,
which
signifies
both
to
kill
,
to
assassinate
,
and
to
plunder
.
To
*NL*
eat
,
true
sense
:
to
devour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
get
well
into
a
corner
,
''
said
Brujon
.
``
Let
's
settle
it
in
three
*NL*
words
,
and
part
at
once
.
There
was
an
affair
that
promised
well
in
the
*NL*
Rue
Plumet
,
a
deserted
street
,
an
isolated
house
,
an
old
rotten
gate
on
*NL*
a
garden
,
and
lone
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
why
not
?
''
demanded
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
girl
,
Eponine
,
went
to
see
about
the
matter
,
''
replied
Babet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
brought
a
biscuit
to
Magnon
,
''
added
Guelemer
.
``
Nothing
to
be
*NL*
made
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
girl
's
no
fool
,
''
said
Thenardier
.
``
Still
,
it
must
be
seen
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
said
Brujon
,
``
it
must
be
looked
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
none
of
the
men
seemed
to
see
Gavroche
,
who
,
during
*NL*
this
colloquy
,
had
seated
himself
on
one
of
the
fence-posts
;
he
waited
*NL*
a
few
moments
,
thinking
that
perhaps
his
father
would
turn
towards
him
,
*NL*
then
he
put
on
his
shoes
again
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
You
do
n't
want
any
more
,
my
men
?
Now
you
're
out
of
your
*NL*
scrape
.
I
'm
off
.
I
must
go
and
get
my
brats
out
of
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
off
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
five
men
emerged
,
one
after
another
,
from
the
enclosure
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Gavroche
had
disappeared
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
des
Ballets
,
*NL*
Babet
took
Thenardier
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
take
a
good
look
at
that
young
`
un
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
young
`

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one
who
climbed
the
wall
and
carried
you
the

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
particularly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
,
but
it
strikes
me
that
it
was
your
son

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bah

said
Thenardier

do
you

CHAPTER
I
--
ORIGIN
*NL*
*NL*
Pigritia
is
a
terrible
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
engenders
a
whole
world
,
la
pegre
,
for
which
read
theft
,
and
a
hell
,
*NL*
la
pegrenne
,
for
which
read
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
idleness
is
the
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
has
a
son
,
theft
,
and
a
daughter
,
hunger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
are
we
at
this
moment
?
In
the
land
of
slang
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
slang
?
It
is
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
a
nation
and
a
dialect
;
*NL*
it
is
theft
in
its
two
kinds
;
people
and
language
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
four
and
thirty
years
ago
,
the
narrator
of
this
grave
and
sombre
*NL*
history
introduced
into
a
work
written
with
the
same
aim
as
this
-LSB-
39
-RSB-
a
*NL*
thief
who
talked
argot
,
there
arose
amazement
and
clamor
.
--
``
What
!
How
!
*NL*
Argot
!
Why
,
argot
is
horrible
!
It
is
the
language
of
prisons
,
galleys
,
*NL*
convicts
,
of
everything
that
is
most
abominable
in
society
!
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
never
understood
this
sort
of
objections
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
that
time
,
two
powerful
romancers
,
one
of
whom
is
a
profound
*NL*
observer
of
the
human
heart
,
the
other
an
intrepid
friend
of
the
people
,
*NL*
Balzac
and
Eugene
Sue
,
having
represented
their
ruffians
as
talking
*NL*
their
natural
language
,
as
the
author
of
The
Last
Day
of
a
Condemned
*NL*
Man
did
in
1828
,
the
same
objections
have
been
raised
.
People
repeated
:
*NL*
``
What
do
authors
mean
by
that
revolting
dialect
?
Slang
is
odious
!
Slang
*NL*
makes
one
shudder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
denies
that
?
Of
course
it
does
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
is
a
question
of
probing
a
wound
,
a
gulf
,
a
society
,
since
when
*NL*
has
it
been
considered
wrong
to
go
too
far
?
to
go
to
the
bottom
?
We
have
*NL*
always
thought
that
it
was
sometimes
a
courageous
act
,
and
,
at
least
,
a
*NL*
simple
and
useful
deed
,
worthy
of
the
sympathetic
attention
which
duty
*NL*
accepted
and
fulfilled
merits
.
Why
should
one
not
explore
everything
,
*NL*
and
study
everything
?
Why
should
one
halt
on
the
way
?
The
halt
is
a
*NL*
matter
depending
on
the
sounding-line
,
and
not
on
the
leadsman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
too
,
it
is
neither
an
attractive
nor
an
easy
task
to
*NL*
undertake
an
investigation
into
the
lowest
depths
of
the
social
order
,
*NL*
where
terra
firma
comes
to
an
end
and
where
mud
begins
,
to
rummage
in
*NL*
those
vague
,
murky
waves
,
to
follow
up
,
to
seize
and
to
fling
,
still
*NL*
quivering
,
upon
the
pavement
that
abject
dialect
which
is
dripping
with
*NL*
filth
when
thus
brought
to
the
light
,
that
pustulous
vocabulary
each
*NL*
word
of
which
seems
an
unclean
ring
from
a
monster
of
the
mire
and
the
*NL*
shadows
.
Nothing
is
more
lugubrious
than
the
contemplation
thus
in
*NL*
its
nudity
,
in
the
broad
light
of
thought
,
of
the
horrible
swarming
of
*NL*
slang
.
It
seems
,
in
fact
,
to
be
a
sort
of
horrible
beast
made
for
the
*NL*
night
which
has
just
been
torn
from
its
cesspool
.
One
thinks
one
beholds
*NL*
a
frightful
,
living
,
and
bristling
thicket
which
quivers
,
rustles
,
*NL*
wavers
,
returns
to
shadow
,
threatens
and
glares
.
One
word
resembles
a
*NL*
claw
,
another
an
extinguished
and
bleeding
eye
,
such
and
such
a
phrase
*NL*
seems
to
move
like
the
claw
of
a
crab
.
All
this
is
alive
with
*NL*
the
hideous
vitality
of
things
which
have
been
organized
out
of
*NL*
disorganization
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
when
has
horror
ever
excluded
study
?
Since
when
has
malady
banished
*NL*
medicine
?
Can
one
imagine
a
naturalist
refusing
to
study
the
viper
,
the
*NL*
bat
,
the
scorpion
,
the
centipede
,
the
tarantula
,
and
one
who
would
*NL*
cast
them
back
into
their
darkness
,
saying
:
``
Oh
!
how
ugly
that
is
!
''
The
*NL*
thinker
who
should
turn
aside
from
slang
would
resemble
a
surgeon
*NL*
who
should
avert
his
face
from
an
ulcer
or
a
wart
.
He
would
be
like
*NL*
a
philologist
refusing
to
examine
a
fact
in
language
,
a
philosopher
*NL*
hesitating
to
scrutinize
a
fact
in
humanity
.
For
,
it
must
be
stated
*NL*
to
those
who
are
ignorant
of
the
case
,
that
argot
is
both
a
literary
*NL*
phenomenon
and
a
social
result
.
What
is
slang
,
properly
speaking
?
It
is
*NL*
the
language
of
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
may
be
stopped
;
the
fact
may
be
put
to
us
in
general
terms
,
which
is
*NL*
one
way
of
attenuating
it
;
we
may
be
told
,
that
all
trades
,
professions
,
*NL*
it
may
be
added
,
all
the
accidents
of
the
social
hierarchy
and
all
*NL*
forms
of
intelligence
,
have
their
own
slang
.
The
merchant
who
says
:
*NL*
``
Montpellier
not
active
,
Marseilles
fine
quality
,
''
the
broker
on
`
change
*NL*
who
says
:
``
Assets

end
of

''
the
gambler
who
says
:
``
Tiers
*NL*
et
tout
,
refait
de

,
''
the
sheriff
of
the
Norman
Isles
who
says
:
*NL*
``
The
holder
in
fee
reverting
to
his
landed
estate
can
not
claim
the
*NL*
fruits
of
that
estate

the
hereditary
seizure
of
the
real
estate
*NL*
by
the
mortgagor
,
''
the
playwright
who
says
:
``
The

was
hissed
,
''
*NL*
the
comedian
who
says

``
I

made

tongue
which

on

that
wonderful

language
of

complete

so
picturesque
,
which
was

spoken
by

*NL*
*NL*
No
doubt
.
But
say
what
we
will
,
this
manner
of
understanding
the
word
*NL*
slang
is
an
extension
which
every
one
will
not
admit
.
For
our
part
,
*NL*
we
reserve
to
the
word
its
ancient
and
precise
,
circumscribed
and
*NL*
determined
significance
,
and
we
restrict
slang
to
slang
.
The
veritable
*NL*
slang
and
the
slang
that
is
pre-eminently
slang
,
if
the
two
words
can
be
*NL*
coupled
thus
,
the
slang
immemorial
which
was
a
kingdom
,
is
nothing
*NL*
else
,
we
repeat
,
than
the
homely
,
uneasy
,
crafty
,
treacherous
,
venomous
,
*NL*
cruel
,
equivocal
,
vile
,
profound
,
fatal
tongue
of
wretchedness
.
There
*NL*
exists
,
at
the
extremity
of
all
abasement
and
all
misfortunes
,
a
last
*NL*
misery
which
revolts
and
makes
up
its
mind
to
enter
into
conflict
*NL*
with
the
whole
mass
of
fortunate
facts
and
reigning
rights
;
a
fearful
*NL*
conflict
,
where
,
now
cunning
,
now
violent
,
unhealthy
and
ferocious
*NL*
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
it
attacks
the
social
order
with
pin-pricks
*NL*
through
vice
,
and
with
club-blows
through
crime
.
To
meet
the
needs
of
*NL*
this
conflict
,
wretchedness
has
invented
a
language
of
combat
,
which
is
*NL*
slang
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
keep
afloat
and
to
rescue
from
oblivion
,
to
hold
above
the
gulf
,
were
*NL*
it
but
a
fragment
of
some
language
which
man
has
spoken
and
which
would
,
*NL*
otherwise
,
be
lost
,
that
is
to
say
,
one
of
the
elements
,
good
or
bad
,
of
*NL*
which
civilization
is
composed
,
or
by
which
it
is
complicated
,
to
extend
*NL*
the
records
of
social
observation
;
is
to
serve
civilization
itself
.
This
*NL*
service
Plautus
rendered
,
consciously
or
unconsciously
,
by
making
two
*NL*
Carthaginian
soldiers
talk
Phoenician
;
that
service
Moliere
rendered
,
*NL*
by
making
so
many
of
his
characters
talk
Levantine
and
all
sorts
of
*NL*
dialects
.
Here
objections
spring
up
afresh
.
Phoenician
,
very
good
!
*NL*
Levantine
,
quite
right
!
Even
dialect
,
let
that
pass
!
They
are
tongues
*NL*
which
have
belonged
to
nations
or
provinces
;
but
slang
!
What
is
the
use
*NL*
of
preserving
slang
?
What
is
the
good
of
assisting
slang
``
to
survive
''
?
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
we
reply
in
one
word
,
only
.
Assuredly
,
if
the
tongue
which
a
*NL*
nation
or
a
province
has
spoken
is
worthy
of
interest
,
the
language
*NL*
which
has
been
spoken
by
a
misery
is
still
more
worthy
of
attention
and
*NL*
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
language
which
has
been
spoken
,
in
France
,
for
example
,
for
*NL*
more
than
four
centuries
,
not
only
by
a
misery
,
but
by
every
possible
*NL*
human
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
we
insist
upon
it
,
the
study
of
social
deformities
and
*NL*
infirmities
,
and
the
task
of
pointing
them
out
with
a
view
to
remedy
,
*NL*
is
not
a
business
in
which
choice
is
permitted
.
The
historian
of
manners
*NL*
and
ideas
has
no
less
austere
a
mission
than
the
historian
of
events
.
*NL*
The
latter
has
the
surface
of
civilization
,
the
conflicts
of
crowns
,
the
*NL*
births
of
princes
,
the
marriages
of
kings
,
battles
,
assemblages
,
great
*NL*
public
men
,
revolutions
in
the
daylight
,
everything
on
the
exterior
;
*NL*
the
other
historian
has
the
interior
,
the
depths
,
the
people
who
toil
,
*NL*
suffer
,
wait
,
the
oppressed
woman
,
the
agonizing
child
,
the
secret
war
*NL*
between
man
and
man
,
obscure
ferocities
,
prejudices
,
plotted
*NL*
iniquities
,
the
subterranean
,
the
indistinct
tremors
of
multitudes
,
the
*NL*
die-of-hunger
,
the
counter-blows
of
the
law
,
the
secret
evolution
of
*NL*
souls
,
the
go-bare-foot
,
the
bare-armed
,
the
disinherited
,
the
orphans
,
*NL*
the
unhappy
,
and
the
infamous
,
all
the
forms
which
roam
through
the
*NL*
darkness
.
He
must
descend
with
his
heart
full
of
charity
,
and
severity
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
as
a
brother
and
as
a
judge
,
to
those
impenetrable
*NL*
casemates
where
crawl
,
pell-mell
,
those
who
bleed
and
those
who
deal
the
*NL*
blow
,
those
who
weep
and
those
who
curse
,
those
who
fast
and
those
*NL*
who
devour
,
those
who
endure
evil
and
those
who
inflict
it
.
Have
these
*NL*
historians
of
hearts
and
souls
duties
at
all
inferior
to
the
historians
*NL*
of
external
facts
?
Does
any
one
think
that
Alighieri
has
any
fewer
*NL*
things
to
say
than
Machiavelli
?
Is
the
under
side
of
civilization
any
*NL*
less
important
than
the
upper
side
merely
because
it
is
deeper
and
more
*NL*
sombre
?
Do
we
really
know
the
mountain
well
when
we
are
not
acquainted
*NL*
with
the
cavern
?
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
,
moreover
,
parenthetically
,
that
from
a
few
words
of
what
*NL*
precedes
a
marked
separation
might
be
inferred
between
the
two
classes
*NL*
of
historians
which
does
not
exist
in
our
mind
.
No
one
is
a
good
*NL*
historian
of
the
patent
,
visible
,
striking
,
and
public
life
of
peoples
,
*NL*
if
he
is
not
,
at
the
same
time
,
in
a
certain
measure
,
the
historian
*NL*
of
their
deep
and
hidden
life
;
and
no
one
is
a
good
historian
of
the
*NL*
interior
unless
he
understands
how
,
at
need
,
to
be
the
historian
of
the
*NL*
exterior
also
.
The
history
of
manners
and
ideas
permeates
the
history
*NL*
of
events
,
and
this
is
true
reciprocally
.
They
constitute
two
different
*NL*
orders
of
facts
which
correspond
to
each
other
,
which
are
always
*NL*
interlaced
,
and
which
often
bring
forth
results
.
All
the
lineaments
*NL*
which
providence
traces
on
the
surface
of
a
nation
have
their
parallels
,
*NL*
sombre
but
distinct
,
in
their
depths
,
and
all
convulsions
of
the
depths
*NL*
produce
ebullitions
on
the
surface
.
True
history
being
a
mixture
of
all
*NL*
things
,
the
true
historian
mingles
in
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Man
is
not
a
circle
with
a
single
centre
;
he
is
an
ellipse
with
a
double
*NL*
focus
.
Facts
form
one
of
these
,
and
ideas
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slang
is
nothing
but
a
dressing-room
where
the
tongue
having
some
*NL*
bad
action
to
perform
,
disguises
itself
.
There
it
clothes
itself
in
*NL*
word-masks
,
in
metaphor-rags
.
In
this
guise
it
becomes
horrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
finds
it
difficult
to
recognize
.
Is
it
really
the
French
tongue
,
the
*NL*
great
human
tongue
?
Behold
it
ready
to
step
upon
the
stage
and
to
retort
*NL*
upon
crime
,
and
prepared
for
all
the
employments
of
the
repertory
of
*NL*
evil
.
It
no
longer
walks
,
it
hobbles
;
it
limps
on
the
crutch
of
the
*NL*
Court
of
Miracles
,
a
crutch
metamorphosable
into
a
club
;
it
is
called
*NL*
vagrancy
;
every
sort
of
spectre
,
its
dressers
,
have
painted
its
face
,
it
*NL*
crawls
and
rears
,
the
double
gait
of
the
reptile
.
Henceforth
,
it
is
apt
*NL*
at
all
roles
,
it
is
made
suspicious
by
the
counterfeiter
,
covered
with
*NL*
verdigris
by
the
forger
,
blacked
by
the
soot
of
the
incendiary
;
and
the
*NL*
murderer
applies
its
rouge
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
listens
,
by
the
side
of
honest
men
,
at
the
portals
of
society
,
*NL*
one
overhears
the
dialogues
of
those
who
are
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
One
distinguishes
questions
and
replies
.
One
perceives
,
without
*NL*
understanding
it
,
a
hideous
murmur
,
sounding
almost
like
human
accents
,
*NL*
but
more
nearly
resembling
a
howl
than
an
articulate
word
.
It
is
slang
.
*NL*
The
words
are
misshapen
and
stamped
with
an
indescribable
and
fantastic
*NL*
bestiality
.
One
thinks
one
hears
hydras
talking
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
unintelligible
in
the
dark
.
It
gnashes
and
whispers
,
completing
*NL*
the
gloom
with
mystery
.
It
is
black
in
misfortune
,
it
is
blacker
still
*NL*
in
crime
;
these
two
blacknesses
amalgamated
,
compose
slang
.
Obscurity
*NL*
in
the
atmosphere
,
obscurity
in
acts
,
obscurity
in
voices
.
Terrible
,
*NL*
toad-like
tongue
which
goes
and
comes
,
leaps
,
crawls
,
slobbers
,
and
*NL*
stirs
about
in
monstrous
wise
in
that
immense
gray
fog
composed
of
rain
*NL*
and
night
,
of
hunger
,
of
vice
,
of
falsehood
,
of
injustice
,
of
nudity
,
of
*NL*
suffocation
,
and
of
winter
,
the
high
noonday
of
the
miserable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
have
compassion
on
the
chastised
.
Alas
!
Who
are
we
ourselves
?
Who
*NL*
am
I
who
now
address
you
?
Who
are
you
who
are
listening
to
me
?
And
are
*NL*
you
very
sure
that
we
have
done
nothing
before
we
were
born
?
The
earth
*NL*
is
not
devoid
of
resemblance
to
a
jail
.
Who
knows
whether
man
is
not
a
*NL*
recaptured
offender
against
divine
justice
?
Look
closely
at
life
.
It
is
*NL*
so
made
,
that
everywhere
we
feel
the
sense
of
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Are
you
what
is
called
a
happy
man
?
Well
!
you
are
sad
every
day
.
Each
*NL*
day
has
its
own
great
grief
or
its
little
care
.
Yesterday
you
were
*NL*
trembling
for
a
health
that
is
dear
to
you
,
to-day
you
fear
for
your
*NL*
own
;
to-morrow
it
will
be
anxiety
about
money
,
the
day
after
to-morrow
*NL*
the
diatribe
of
a
slanderer
,
the
day
after
that
,
the
misfortune
of
some
*NL*
friend
;
then
the
prevailing
weather
,
then
something
that
has
been
broken
*NL*
or
lost
,
then
a
pleasure
with
which
your
conscience
and
your
vertebral
*NL*
column
reproach
you
;
again
,
the
course
of
public
affairs
.
This
without
*NL*
reckoning
in
the
pains
of
the
heart
.
And
so
it
goes
on
.
One
cloud
is
*NL*
dispelled
,
another
forms
.
There
is
hardly
one
day
out
of
a
hundred
which
*NL*
is
wholly
joyous
and
sunny
.
And
you
belong
to
that
small
class
who
are
*NL*
happy
!
As
for
the
rest
of
mankind
,
stagnating
night
rests
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thoughtful
minds
make
but
little
use
of
the
phrase
:
the
fortunate
and
*NL*
the
unfortunate
.
In
this
world
,
evidently
the
vestibule
of
another
,
*NL*
there
are
no
fortunate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
real
human
division
is
this
:
the
luminous
and
the
shady
.
To
diminish
*NL*
the
number
of
the
shady
,
to
augment
the
number
of
the
luminous
,
--
that
*NL*
is
the
object
.
That
is
why
we
cry
:
Education
!
science
!
To
teach
reading
,
*NL*
means
to
light
the
fire
;
every
syllable
spelled
out
sparkles
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
who
says
light
does
not
,
necessarily
,
say
joy
.
People
suffer
*NL*
in
the
light
;
excess
burns
.
The
flame
is
the
enemy
of
the
wing
.
To
burn
*NL*
without
ceasing
to
fly
,
--
therein
lies
the
marvel
of
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
you
shall
have
learned
to
know
,
and
to
love
,
you
will
still
suffer
.
*NL*
The
day
is
born
in
tears
.
The
luminous
weep
,
if
only
over
those
in
*NL*
darkness

CHAPTER
II
--
ROOTS
*NL*
*NL*
Slang
is
the
tongue
of
those
who
sit
in
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thought
is
moved
in
its
most
sombre
depths
,
social
philosophy
is
bidden
*NL*
to
its
most
poignant
meditations
,
in
the
presence
of
that
enigmatic
*NL*
dialect
at
once
so
blighted
and
rebellious
.
Therein
lies
chastisement
*NL*
made
visible
.
Every
syllable
has
an
air
of
being
marked
.
The
words
of
*NL*
the
vulgar
tongue
appear
therein
wrinkled
and
shrivelled
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
beneath
the
hot
iron
of
the
executioner
.
Some
seem
to
be
still
smoking
.
*NL*
Such
and
such
a
phrase
produces
upon
you
the
effect
of
the
shoulder
of
a
*NL*
thief
branded
with
the
fleur-de-lys
,
which
has
suddenly
been
laid
bare
.
*NL*
Ideas
almost
refuse
to
be
expressed
in
these
substantives
which
are
*NL*
fugitives
from
justice
.
Metaphor
is
sometimes
so
shameless
,
that
one
*NL*
feels
that
it
has
worn
the
iron
neck-fetter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
in
spite
of
all
this
,
and
because
of
all
this
,
this
strange
*NL*
dialect
has
by
rights
,
its
own
compartment
in
that
great
impartial
case
*NL*
of
pigeon-holes
where
there
is
room
for
the
rusty
farthing
as
well
as
*NL*
for
the
gold
medal
,
and
which
is
called
literature
.
Slang
,
whether
the
*NL*
public
admit
the
fact
or
not
has
its
syntax
and
its
poetry
.
It
is
a
*NL*
language
.
Yes
,
by
the
deformity
of
certain
terms
,
we
recognize
the
*NL*
fact
that
it
was
chewed
by
Mandrin
,
and
by
the
splendor
of
certain
*NL*
metonymies
,
we
feel
that
Villon
spoke
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
exquisite
and
celebrated
verse
--
*NL*
*NL*
Mais
ou
sont
les
neiges
d'antan
?
*NL*
But
where
are
the
snows
of
years
gone
by
?
*NL*
*NL*
is
a
verse
of
slang
.
Antam
--
ante
annum
--
is
a
word
of
Thunes
slang
,
which
*NL*
signified
the
past
year
,
and
by
extension
,
formerly
.
Thirty-five
years
*NL*
ago
,
at
the
epoch
of
the
departure
of
the
great
chain-gang
,
there
could
*NL*
be
read
in
one
of
the
cells
at
Bicetre
,
this
maxim
engraved
with
a
*NL*
nail
on
the
wall
by
a
king
of
Thunes
condemned
to
the
galleys
:
Les
dabs
*NL*
d'antan
trimaient
siempre
pour
la
pierre
du
Coesre
.
This
means
Kings
in
*NL*
days
gone
by
always
went
and
had
themselves
anointed
.
In
the
opinion
of
*NL*
that
king
,
anointment
meant
the
galleys
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
word
decarade
,
which
expresses
the
departure
of
heavy
vehicles
at
*NL*
a
gallop
,
is
attributed
to
Villon
,
and
it
is
worthy
of
him
.
This
word
,
*NL*
which
strikes
fire
with
all
four
of
its
feet
,
sums
up
in
a
masterly
*NL*
onomatopoeia
the
whole
of
La
Fontaine
's
admirable
verse
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Six
forts
chevaux
tiraient
un
coche
.
*NL*
Six
stout
horses
drew
a
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
purely
literary
point
of
view
,
few
studies
would
prove
more
*NL*
curious
and
fruitful
than
the
study
of
slang
.
It
is
a
whole
language
*NL*
within
a
language
,
a
sort
of
sickly
excrescence
,
an
unhealthy
graft
*NL*
which
has
produced
a
vegetation
,
a
parasite
which
has
its
roots
in
the
*NL*
old
Gallic
trunk
,
and
whose
sinister
foliage
crawls
all
over
one
side
of
*NL*
the
language
.
This
is
what
may
be
called
the
first
,
the
vulgar
aspect
of
*NL*
slang
.
But
,
for
those
who
study
the
tongue
as
it
should
be
studied
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
as
geologists
study
the
earth
,
slang
appears
like
a
veritable
*NL*
alluvial
deposit
.
According
as
one
digs
a
longer
or
shorter
distance
*NL*
into
it
,
one
finds
in
slang
,
below
the
old
popular
French
,
Provencal
,
*NL*
Spanish
,
Italian
,
Levantine
,
that
language
of
the
Mediterranean
ports
,
*NL*
English
and
German
,
the
Romance
language
in
its
three
varieties
,
French
,
*NL*
Italian
,
and
Romance
Romance
,
Latin
,
and
finally
Basque
and
Celtic
.
A
*NL*
profound
and
unique
formation
.
A
subterranean
edifice
erected
in
common
*NL*
by
all
the
miserable
.
Each
accursed
race
has
deposited
its
layer
,
each
*NL*
suffering
has
dropped
its
stone
there
,
each
heart
has
contributed
its
*NL*
pebble
.
A
throng
of
evil
,
base
,
or
irritated
souls
,
who
have
traversed
*NL*
life
and
have
vanished
into
eternity
,
linger
there
almost
entirely
*NL*
visible
still
beneath
the
form
of
some
monstrous
word
.
*NL*

The
old

There
is
one
word

crops
up
*NL*
in
every
language
of
the
continent
,
with
a
sort
of
mysterious
power
and
*NL*
authority
.
It
is
the
word
magnus

on
the
galleys

*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
the
philological
origins
just
indicated
,
slang
possesses
*NL*
other
and
still
more
natural
roots
,
which
spring
,
so
to
speak
,
from
the
*NL*
mind
of
man
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
first
place
,
the
direct
creation
of
words
.
Therein
lies
the
*NL*
mystery
of
tongues
.
To
paint
with
words
,
which
contains
figures
*NL*
one
knows
not
how
or
why
,
is
the
primitive
foundation
of
all
human
*NL*
languages
,
what
may
be
called
their
granite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slang
abounds
in
words
of
this
description
,
immediate
words
,
words
*NL*
created
instantaneously
no
one
knows
either
where
or
by
whom
,
without
*NL*
etymology
,
without
analogies
,
without
derivatives
,
solitary
,
barbarous
,
*NL*
sometimes
hideous
words
,
which
at
times
possess
a
singular
power
of
*NL*
expression
and
which
live
.
The
executioner
,
le
taule
;
the
forest
,
*NL*
le
sabri
;
fear
,
flight
,
taf
;
the
lackey
,
le
larbin
;
the
mineral
,
*NL*
the
prefect
,
the
minister
,
pharos
;
the
devil
,
le
rabouin
.
Nothing
is
*NL*
stranger
than
these
words
which
both
mask
and
reveal
.
Some
,
le
rabouin
,
*NL*
for
example
,
are
at
the
same
time
grotesque
and
terrible
,
and
produce
on
*NL*
you
the
effect
of
a
cyclopean
grimace
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
place
,
metaphor
.
The
peculiarity
of
a
language
which
is
*NL*
desirous
of
saying
all
yet
concealing
all
is
that
it
is
rich
in
figures
.
*NL*
Metaphor
is
an
enigma
,
wherein
the
thief
who
is
plotting
a
stroke
,
*NL*
the
prisoner
who
is
arranging
an
escape
,
take
refuge
.
No
idiom
is
more
*NL*
metaphorical
than
slang
:
devisser
le
coco
-LRB-
to
unscrew
the
nut
-RRB-
,
to
twist
*NL*
the
neck
;
tortiller
-LRB-
to
wriggle
-RRB-
,
to
eat
;
etre
gerbe
,
to
be
tried
;
a
*NL*
rat
,
a
bread
thief
;
il
lansquine
,
it
rains
,
a
striking
,
ancient
figure
*NL*
which
partly
bears
its
date
about
it
,
which
assimilates
long
oblique
*NL*
lines
of
rain
,
with
the
dense
and
slanting
pikes
of
the
lancers
,
and
*NL*
which
compresses
into
a
single
word
the
popular
expression
:
it
rains
*NL*
halberds
.
Sometimes
,
in
proportion
as
slang
progresses
from
the
first
*NL*
epoch
to
the
second
,
words
pass
from
the
primitive
and
savage
sense
to
*NL*
the
metaphorical
sense
.
The
devil
ceases
to
be
le
rabouin
,
and
becomes
*NL*
le
boulanger
-LRB-
the
baker
-RRB-
,
who
puts
the
bread
into
the
oven
.
This
is
*NL*
more
witty
,
but
less
grand
,
something
like
Racine
after
Corneille
,
like
*NL*
Euripides
after
AEschylus
.
Certain
slang
phrases
which
participate
*NL*
in
the
two
epochs
and
have
at
once
the
barbaric
character
and
the
*NL*
metaphorical
character
resemble
phantasmagories
.
Les
sorgueuers
vont
*NL*
solliciter
des
gails
a
la
lune
--
the
prowlers
are
going
to
steal
horses
*NL*
by
night
,
--
this
passes
before
the
mind
like
a
group
of
spectres
.
One
*NL*
knows
not
what
one
sees
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
third
place
,
the
expedient
.
Slang
lives
on
the
language
.
It
uses
*NL*
it
in
accordance
with
its
fancy
,
it
dips
into
it
hap-hazard
,
and
it
*NL*
often
confines
itself
,
when
occasion
arises
,
to
alter
it
in
a
gross
and
*NL*
summary
fashion
.
Occasionally
,
with
the
ordinary
words
thus
deformed
and
*NL*
complicated
with
words
of
pure
slang
,
picturesque
phrases
are
formed
,
in
*NL*
which
there
can
be
felt
the
mixture
of
the
two
preceding
elements
,
the
*NL*
direct
creation
and
the
metaphor
:
le
cab
jaspine
,
je
marronne
que
la
*NL*
roulotte
de
Pantin
trime
dans
le
sabri
,
the
dog
is
barking
,
I
suspect
*NL*
that
the
diligence
for
Paris
is
passing
through
the
woods
.
Le
dab
est
*NL*
sinve
,
la
dabuge
est
merloussiere
,
la
fee
est
bative
,
the
bourgeois
is
*NL*
stupid
,
the
bourgeoise
is
cunning
,
the
daughter
is
pretty
.
Generally
,
*NL*
to
throw
listeners
off
the
track
,
slang
confines
itself
to
adding
to
*NL*
all
the
words
of
the
language
without
distinction
,
an
ignoble
tail
,
a
*NL*
termination
in
aille
,
in
orgue
,
in
iergue
,
or
in
uche
.
Thus
:
Vousiergue
*NL*
trouvaille
bonorgue
ce
gigotmuche
?
Do
you
think
that
leg
of
mutton
*NL*
good
?
A
phrase
addressed
by
Cartouche
to
a
turnkey
in
order
to
find
out
*NL*
whether
the
sum
offered
for
his
escape
suited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
termination
in
mar
has
been
added
recently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slang
,
being
the
dialect
of
corruption
,
quickly
becomes
corrupted
*NL*
itself
.
Besides
this
,
as
it
is
always
seeking
concealment
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
it
feels
that
it
is
understood
,
it
changes
its
form
.
Contrary
to
what
*NL*
happens
with
every
other
vegetation
,
every
ray
of
light
which
falls
*NL*
upon
it
kills
whatever
it
touches
.
Thus
slang
is
in
constant
process
of
*NL*
decomposition
and
recomposition
;
an
obscure
and
rapid
work
which
never
*NL*
pauses
.
It
passes
over
more
ground
in
ten
years
than
a
language
in
ten
*NL*
centuries
.
Thus
le
larton
-LRB-
bread
-RRB-
becomes
le
lartif
;
le
gail
-LRB-
horse
-RRB-
*NL*
becomes
le
gaye
;
la
fertanche
-LRB-
straw
-RRB-
becomes
la
fertille
;
le
momignard
*NL*
-LRB-
brat
-RRB-
,
le
momacque
;
les
fiques
-LRB-
duds
-RRB-
,
frusques
;
la
chique
-LRB-
the
*NL*
church
-RRB-
,
l'egrugeoir
;
le
colabre
-LRB-
neck
-RRB-
,
le
colas
.
The
devil
is
at
*NL*
first
,
gahisto
,
then
le
rabouin
,
then
the
baker
;
the
priest
is
a
*NL*
ratichon
,
then
the
boar
-LRB-
le
sanglier
-RRB-
;
the
dagger
is
le
vingt-deux
*NL*
-LRB-
twenty-two
-RRB-
,
then
le
surin
,
then
le
lingre
;
the
police
are
railles
,
*NL*
then
roussins
,
then
rousses
,
then
marchands
de
lacets
-LRB-
dealers
in
*NL*
stay-laces
-RRB-
,
then
coquers
,
then
cognes
;
the
executioner
is
le
taule
,
*NL*
then
Charlot
,
l'atigeur
,
then
le
becquillard
.
In
the
seventeenth
*NL*
century
,
to
fight
was
``
to
give
each
other
snuff
''
;
in
the
nineteenth
*NL*
it
is
``
to
chew
each
other
's
throats
.
''
There
have
been
twenty
different
*NL*
phrases
between
these
two
extremes
.
Cartouche
's
talk
would
have
been
*NL*
Hebrew
to
Lacenaire
.
All
the
words
of
this
language
are
perpetually
*NL*
engaged
in
flight
like
the
men
who
utter
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
from
time
to
time
,
and
in
consequence
of
this
very
movement
,
*NL*
the
ancient
slang
crops
up
again
and
becomes
new
once
more
.
It
has
its
*NL*
headquarters
where
it
maintains
its
sway
.
The
Temple
preserved
the
slang
*NL*
of
the
seventeenth
century
;
Bicetre
,
when
it
was
a
prison
,
preserved
the
*NL*
slang
of
Thunes
.
There
one
could
hear
the
termination
in
anche
of
*NL*
the
old
Thuneurs
.
Boyanches-tu
-LRB-
bois-tu
-RRB-
,
do
you
drink
?
But
perpetual
*NL*
movement
remains
its
law
,
nevertheless
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
philosopher
succeeds
in
fixing
,
for
a
moment
,
for
purposes
of
*NL*
observation
,
this
language
which
is
incessantly
evaporating
,
he
falls
*NL*
into
doleful
and
useful
meditation
.
No
study
is
more
efficacious
and
*NL*
more
fecund
in
instruction
.
There
is
not
a
metaphor
,
not
an
analogy
,
in
*NL*
slang
,
which
does
not
contain
a
lesson
.
Among
these
men
,
to
beat
means
*NL*
to
feign
;
one
beats
a
malady
;
ruse
is
their
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
them
,
the
idea
of
the
man
is
not
separated
from
the
idea
of
*NL*
darkness
.
The
night
is
called
la
sorgue
;
man
,
l'orgue
.
Man
is
a
*NL*
derivative
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
have
taken
up
the
practice
of
considering
society
in
the
light
*NL*
of
an
atmosphere
which
kills
them
,
of
a
fatal
force
,
and
they
speak
of
*NL*
their
liberty
as
one
would
speak
of
his
health
.
A
man
under
arrest
is
a
*NL*
sick
man
;
one
who
is
condemned
is
a
dead
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
terrible
thing
for
the
prisoner
within
the
four
walls
in
which
*NL*
he
is
buried
,
is
a
sort
of
glacial
chastity
,
and
he
calls
the
dungeon
*NL*
the
castus
.
In
that
funereal
place
,
life
outside
always
presents
itself
*NL*
under
its
most
smiling
aspect
.
The
prisoner
has
irons
on
his
feet
;
you
*NL*
think
,
perhaps
,
that
his
thought
is
that
it
is
with
the
feet
that
one
*NL*
walks
?
No
;
he
is
thinking
that
it
is
with
the
feet
that
one
dances
;
so
,
*NL*
when
he
has
succeeded
in
severing
his
fetters
,
his
first
idea
is
that
*NL*
now
he
can
dance
,
and
he
calls
the
saw
the
bastringue
-LRB-
public-house
*NL*
ball
-RRB-
.
--
A
name
is
a
centre
;
profound
assimilation
.
--
The
ruffian
has
two
*NL*
heads
,
one
of
which
reasons
out
his
actions
and
leads
him
all
his
life
*NL*
long
,
and
the
other
which
he
has
upon
his
shoulders
on
the
day
of
his
*NL*
death
;
he
calls
the
head
which
counsels
him
in
crime
la
sorbonne
,
*NL*
and
the
head
which
expiates
it
la
tronche
.
--
When
a
man
has
no
longer
*NL*
anything
but
rags
upon
his
body
and
vices
in
his
heart
,
when
he
has
*NL*
arrived
at
that
double
moral
and
material
degradation
which
the
word
*NL*
blackguard
characterizes
in
its
two
acceptations
,
he
is
ripe
for
crime
;
*NL*
he
is
like
a
well-whetted
knife
;
he
has
two
cutting
edges
,
his
*NL*
distress
and
his
malice
;
so
slang
does
not
say
a
blackguard
,
it
says
*NL*
un
reguise
.
--
What
are
the
galleys
?
A
brazier
of
damnation
,
a
hell
.
The
*NL*
convict
calls
himself
a
fagot
.
--
And
finally
,
what
name
do
malefactors
*NL*
give
to
their
prison
?
The
college
.
A
whole
penitentiary
system
can
be
*NL*
evolved
from
that
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Does
the
reader
wish
to
know
where
the
majority
of
the
songs
of
the
*NL*
galleys
,
those
refrains
called
in
the
special
vocabulary
lirlonfa
,
have
*NL*
had
their
birth
?
*NL*
*NL*
Let
him
listen
to
what
follows
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
There
existed
at
the
Chatelet
in
Paris
a
large
and
long
cellar
.
This
*NL*
cellar
was
eight
feet
below
the
level
of
the
Seine
.
It
had
neither
*NL*
windows
nor
air-holes
,
its
only
aperture
was
the
door
;
men
could
enter
*NL*
there
,
air
could
not
.
This
vault
had
for
ceiling
a
vault
of
stone
,
and
*NL*
for
floor
ten
inches
of
mud
.
It
was
flagged
;
but
the
pavement
had
rotted
*NL*
and
cracked
under
the
oozing
of
the
water
.
Eight
feet
above
the
floor
,
*NL*
a
long
and
massive
beam
traversed
this
subterranean
excavation
from
side
*NL*
to
side
;
from
this
beam
hung
,
at
short
distances
apart
,
chains
three
*NL*
feet
long
,
and
at
the
end
of
these
chains
there
were
rings
for
the
*NL*
neck
.
In
this
vault
,
men
who
had
been
condemned
to
the
galleys
were
*NL*
incarcerated
until
the
day
of
their
departure
for
Toulon
.
They
were
*NL*
thrust
under
this
beam
,
where
each
one
found
his
fetters
swinging
in
the
*NL*
darkness
and
waiting
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chains
,
those
pendant
arms
,
and
the
necklets
,
those
open
hands
,
*NL*
caught
the
unhappy
wretches
by
the
throat
.
They
were
rivetted
and
*NL*
left
there
.
As
the
chain
was
too
short
,
they
could
not
lie
down
.
They
*NL*
remained
motionless
in
that
cavern
,
in
that
night
,
beneath
that
beam
,
*NL*
almost
hanging
,
forced
to
unheard-of
efforts
to
reach
their
bread
,
jug
,
*NL*
or
their
vault
overhead
,
mud
even
to
mid-leg
,
filth
flowing
to
their
*NL*
very
calves
,
broken
asunder
with
fatigue
,
with
thighs
and
knees
giving
*NL*
way
,
clinging
fast
to
the
chain
with
their
hands
in
order
to
obtain
some
*NL*
rest
,
unable
to
sleep
except
when
standing
erect
,
and
awakened
every
*NL*
moment
by
the
strangling
of
the
collar
;
some
woke
no
more
.
In
order
to
*NL*
eat
,
they
pushed
the
bread
,
which
was
flung
to
them
in
the
mud
,
along
*NL*
their
leg
with
their
heel
until
it
reached
their
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
did
they
remain
thus
?
One
month
,
two
months
,
six
months
*NL*
sometimes
;
one
stayed
a
year
.
It
was
the
antechamber
of
the
galleys
.
*NL*
Men
were
put
there
for
stealing
a
hare
from
the
king
.
In
this
*NL*
sepulchre-hell
,
what
did
they
do
?
What
man
can
do
in
a
sepulchre
,
they
*NL*
went
through
the
agonies
of
death
,
and
what
can
man
do
in
hell
,
they
*NL*
sang
;
for
song
lingers
where
there
is
no
longer
any
hope
.
In
the
waters
*NL*
of
Malta
,
when
a
galley
was
approaching
,
the
song
could
be
heard
before
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
oars
.
Poor
Survincent
,
the
poacher
,
who
had
gone
*NL*
through
the
prison-cellar
of
the
Chatelet
,
said
:
``
It
was
the
rhymes
that
*NL*
kept
me
up
.
''
Uselessness
of
poetry
.
What
is
the
good
of
rhyme
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
this
cellar
that
nearly
all
the
slang
songs
had
their
birth
.
*NL*
It
is
from
the
dungeon
of
the
Grand-Chatelet
of
Paris
that
comes
*NL*
the
melancholy
refrain
of
the
Montgomery
galley
:
``
Timaloumisaine
,
*NL*
timaloumison
.
''
The
majority
of
these
:
*NL*
*NL*
Icicaille
est
la
theatre
Here
is
the
theatre
*NL*
Du
petit
dardant
.
Of
the
little
archer
-LRB-
Cupid
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Do
what
you
will
,
you
can
not
annihilate
that
eternal
relic
in
the
heart
*NL*
of
man
,
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
world
of
dismal
deeds
,
people
keep
their
secrets
.
The
secret
is
*NL*
the
thing
above
all
others
.
The
secret
,
in
the
eyes
of
these
wretches
,
*NL*
is
unity
which
serves
as
a
base
of
union
.
To
betray
a
secret
is
to
*NL*
tear
from
each
member
of
this
fierce
community
something
of
his
own
*NL*
personality
.
To
inform
against
,
in
the
energetic
slang
dialect
,
is
*NL*
called
:
``
to
eat
the
bit
.
''
As
though
the
informer
drew
to
himself
a
*NL*
little
of
the
substance
of
all
and
nourished
himself
on
a
bit
of
each
*NL*
one
's
flesh
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
does
it
signify
to
receive
a
box
on
the
ear
?
Commonplace
metaphor
*NL*
replies
:
``
It
is
to
see
thirty-six
candles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
slang
intervenes
and
takes
it
up
:
Candle
,
camoufle
.
Thereupon
,
the
*NL*
ordinary
tongue
gives
camouflet
-LSB-
42
-RSB-
as
the
synonym
for
soufflet
.
Thus
,
*NL*
by
a
sort
of
infiltration
from
below
upwards
,
with
the
aid
of
metaphor
,
*NL*
that
incalculable
,
trajectory
slang
mounts
from
the
cavern
to
the
*NL*
Academy
;
and
Poulailler
saying
:
``
I
light
my
camoufle
,
''
causes
Voltaire
*NL*
to
write
:
``
Langleviel
La
Beaumelle
deserves
a
hundred
camouflets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Researches
in
slang
mean
discoveries
at
every
step
.
Study
and
*NL*
investigation
of
this
strange
idiom
lead
to
the
mysterious
point
of
*NL*
intersection
of
regular
society
with
society
which
is
accursed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thief
also
has
his
food
for
cannon
,
stealable
matter
,

*NL*
whoever
passes
by
;

-LRB-
Pan
,

-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Slang
is
language
turned
convict
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
thinking
principle
of
man
be
thrust
down
ever
so
low
,
that
it
*NL*
can
be
dragged
and
pinioned
there
by
obscure
tyrannies
of
fatality
,
*NL*
that
it
can
be
bound
by
no
one
knows
what
fetters
in
that
abyss
,
is
*NL*
sufficient
to
create
consternation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
poor
thought
of
miserable
wretches
!
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
will
no
one
come
to
the
succor
of
the
human
soul
in
that
darkness
?
*NL*
Is
it
her
destiny
there
to
await
forever
the
mind
,
the
liberator
,
the
*NL*
immense
rider
of
Pegasi
and
hippo-griffs
,
the
combatant
of
heroes
of
*NL*
the
dawn
who
shall
descend
from
the
azure
between
two
wings
,
the
radiant
*NL*
knight
of
the
future
?
Will
she
forever
summon
in
vain
to
her
assistance
*NL*
the
lance
of
light
of
the
ideal
?
Is
she
condemned
to
hear
the
fearful
*NL*
approach
of
Evil
through
the
density
of
the
gulf
,
and
to
catch
glimpses
,
*NL*
nearer
and
nearer
at
hand
,
beneath
the
hideous
water
of
that
dragon
's
*NL*
head
,
that
maw
streaked
with
foam
,
and
that
writhing
undulation
of
*NL*
claws
,
swellings
,
and
rings
?
Must
it
remain
there
,
without
a
gleam
*NL*
of
light
,
without
hope
,
given
over
to
that
terrible
approach
,
vaguely
*NL*
scented
out
by
the
monster
,
shuddering
,
dishevelled
,
wringing
its
arms
,
*NL*
forever
chained

CHAPTER
III
--
SLANG
WHICH
WEEPS
AND
SLANG
WHICH
LAUGHS
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
reader
perceives
,
slang
in
its
entirety
,
slang
of
four
hundred
*NL*
years
ago
,
like
the
slang
of
to-day
,
is
permeated
with
that
sombre
,
*NL*
symbolical
spirit
which
gives
to
all
words
a
mien
which
is
now
mournful
,
*NL*
now
menacing
.
One
feels
in
it
the
wild
and
ancient
sadness
of
those
*NL*
vagrants
of
the
Court
of
Miracles
who
played
at
cards
with
packs
of
*NL*
their
own
,
some
of
which
have
come
down
to
us
.
The
eight
of
clubs
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
represented
a
huge
tree
bearing
eight
enormous
trefoil
leaves
,
*NL*
a
sort
of
fantastic
personification
of
the
forest
.
At
the
foot
of
this
*NL*
tree
a
fire
was
burning
,
over
which
three
hares
were
roasting
a
huntsman
*NL*
on
a
spit
,
and
behind
him
,
on
another
fire
,
hung
a
steaming
pot
,
whence
*NL*
emerged
the
head
of
a
dog
.
Nothing
can
be
more
melancholy
than
these
*NL*
reprisals
in
painting
,
by
a
pack
of
cards
,
in
the
presence
of
stakes
*NL*
for
the
roasting
of
smugglers
and
of
the
cauldron
for
the
boiling
of
*NL*
counterfeiters
.
The
diverse
forms
assumed
by
thought
in
the
realm
*NL*
of
slang
,
even
song
,
even
raillery
,
even
menace
,
all
partook
of
this
*NL*
powerless
and
dejected
character
.
All
the
songs
,
the
melodies
of
some
*NL*
of
which
have
been
collected
,
were
humble
and
lamentable
to
the
point
of
*NL*
evoking
tears
.
The
pegre
is
always
the
poor
pegre
,
and
he
is
always
*NL*
the
hare
in
hiding
,
the
fugitive
mouse
,
the
flying
bird
.
He
hardly
*NL*
complains
,
he
contents
himself
with
sighing
;
one
of
his
moans
has
come
*NL*
down
to
us
:
``
I
do
not
understand
how
God
,
the
father
of
men
,
can
torture
*NL*
his
children
and
his
grandchildren
and
hear
them
cry
,
without
himself
*NL*
suffering
torture
.
''
-LSB-
43
-RSB-
The
wretch
,
whenever
he
has
time
to
think
,
makes
*NL*
himself
small
before
the
low
,
and
frail
in
the
presence
of
society
;
*NL*
he
lies
down
flat
on
his
face
,
he
entreats
,
he
appeals
to
the
side
of
*NL*
compassion
;
we
feel
that
he
is
conscious
of
his
guilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
the
middle
of
the
last
century
a
change
took
place
,
prison
songs
*NL*
and
thieves
'
ritournelles
assumed
,
so
to
speak
,
an
insolent
and
jovial
*NL*
mien
.
The
plaintive
malure
was
replaced
by
the
larifla
.
We
find
in
the
*NL*
eighteenth
century
,
in
nearly
all
the
songs
of
the
galleys
and
prisons
,
*NL*
a
diabolical
and
enigmatical
gayety
.
We
hear
this
strident
and
lilting
*NL*
refrain
which
we
should
say
had
been
lighted
up
by
a
phosphorescent
*NL*
gleam
,
and
which
seems
to
have
been
flung
into
the
forest
by
a
*NL*
will-o
'
-
the-wisp
playing
the
fife
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Miralabi
suslababo
*NL*
Mirliton
ribonribette
*NL*
Surlababi
mirlababo
*NL*
Mirliton
ribonribo
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
sung
in
a
cellar
or
in
a
nook
of
the
forest
while
cutting
a
*NL*
man
's
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
serious
symptom
.
In
the
eighteenth
century
,
the
ancient
melancholy
of
*NL*
the
dejected
classes
vanishes
.
They
began
to
laugh
.
They
rally
the
grand
*NL*
meg
and
the
grand
dab
.
Given
Louis
XV
.
they
call
the
King
of
France
``
le
*NL*
Marquis
de
Pantin
.
''
And
behold
,
they
are
almost
gay
.
A
sort
of
gleam
*NL*
proceeds
from
these
miserable
wretches
,
as
though
their
consciences
were
*NL*
not
heavy
within
them
any
more
.
These
lamentable
tribes
of
darkness
have
*NL*
no
longer
merely
the
desperate
audacity
of
actions
,
they
possess
the
*NL*
heedless
audacity
of
mind
.
A
sign
that
they
are
losing
the
sense
of
*NL*
their
criminality
,
and
that
they
feel
,
even
among
thinkers
and
dreamers
,
*NL*
some
indefinable
support
which
the
latter
themselves
know
not
of
.
A
*NL*
sign
that
theft
and
pillage
are
beginning
to
filter
into
doctrines
and
*NL*
sophisms
,
in
such
a
way
as
to
lose
somewhat
of
their
ugliness
,
while
*NL*
communicating
much
of
it
to
sophisms
and
doctrines
.
A
sign
,
in
short
,
of
*NL*
some
outbreak
which
is
prodigious
and
near
unless
some
diversion
shall
*NL*
arise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
pause
a
moment
.
Whom
are
we
accusing
here
?
Is
it
the
eighteenth
*NL*
century
?
Is
it
philosophy
?
Certainly
not
.
The
work
of
the
eighteenth
*NL*
century
is
healthy
and
good
and
wholesome
.
The
encyclopedists
,
Diderot
*NL*
at
their
head
;
the
physiocrates
,
Turgot
at
their
head
;
the
philosophers
,
*NL*
Voltaire
at
their
head
;
the
Utopians
,
Rousseau
at
their
head
,
--
these
are
*NL*
four
sacred
legions
.
Humanity
's
immense
advance
towards
the
light
is
due
*NL*
to
them
.
They
are
the
four
vanguards
of
the
human
race
,
marching
towards
*NL*
the
four
cardinal
points
of
progress
.
Diderot
towards
the
beautiful
,
*NL*
Turgot
towards
the
useful
,
Voltaire
towards
the
true
,
Rousseau
towards
*NL*
the
just
.
But
by
the
side
of
and
above
the
philosophers
,
there
were
the
*NL*
sophists
,
a
venomous
vegetation
mingled
with
a
healthy
growth
,
hemlock
*NL*
in
the
virgin
forest
.
While
the
executioner
was
burning
the
great
*NL*
books
of
the
liberators
of
the
century
on
the
grand
staircase
of
the
*NL*
court-house
,
writers
now
forgotten
were
publishing
,
with
the
King
's
*NL*
sanction
,
no
one
knows
what
strangely
disorganizing
writings
,
which
were
*NL*
eagerly
read
by
the
unfortunate
.
Some
of
these
publications
,
odd
to
*NL*
say
,
which
were
patronized
by
a
prince
,
are
to
be
found
in
the
Secret
*NL*
Library
.
These
facts
,
significant
but
unknown
,
were
imperceptible
on
the
*NL*
surface
.
Sometimes
,
in
the
very
obscurity
of
a
fact
lurks
its
danger
.
*NL*
It
is
obscure
because
it
is
underhand
.
Of
all
these
writers
,
the
one
*NL*
who
probably
then
excavated
in
the
masses
the
most
unhealthy
gallery
was
*NL*
Restif
de
La
Bretonne
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
work
,
peculiar
to
the
whole
of
Europe
,
effected
more
ravages
in
*NL*
Germany
than
anywhere
else
.
In
Germany
,
during
a
given
period
,
summed
up
*NL*
by
Schiller
in
his
famous
drama
The
Robbers
,
theft
and
pillage
rose
up
*NL*
in
protest
against
property
and
labor
,
assimilated
certain
specious
and
*NL*
false
elementary
ideas
,
which
,
though
just
in
appearance
,
were
absurd
in
*NL*
reality
,
enveloped
themselves
in
these
ideas
,
disappeared
within
them
,
*NL*
after
a
fashion
,
assumed
an
abstract
name
,
passed
into
the
state
of
*NL*
theory
,
and
in
that
shape
circulated
among
the
laborious
,
suffering
,
and
*NL*
honest
masses
,
unknown
even
to
the
imprudent
chemists
who
had
prepared
*NL*
the
mixture
,
unknown
even
to
the
masses
who
accepted
it
.
Whenever
a
fact
*NL*
of
this
sort
presents
itself
,
the
case
is
grave
.
Suffering
engenders
*NL*
wrath
;
and
while
the
prosperous
classes
blind
themselves
or
fall
asleep
,
*NL*
which
is
the
same
thing
as
shutting
one
's
eyes
,
the
hatred
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
classes
lights
its
torch
at
some
aggrieved
or
ill-made
*NL*
spirit
which
dreams
in
a
corner
,
and
sets
itself
to
the
scrutiny
of
*NL*
society
.
The
scrutiny
of
hatred
is
a
terrible
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
if
the
ill-fortune
of
the
times
so
wills
it
,
those
fearful
*NL*
commotions
which
were
formerly
called
jacqueries
,
beside
which
purely
*NL*
political
agitations
are
the
merest
child
's
play
,
which
are
no
longer
*NL*
the
conflict
of
the
oppressed
and
the
oppressor
,
but
the
revolt
of
*NL*
discomfort
against
comfort
.
Then
everything
crumbles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacqueries
are
earthquakes
of
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
this
peril
,
possibly
imminent
towards
the
close
of
the
eighteenth
*NL*
century
,
which
the
French
Revolution
,
that
immense
act
of
probity
,
cut
*NL*
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
French
Revolution
,
which
is
nothing
else
than
the
idea
armed
with
*NL*
the
sword
,
rose
erect
,
and
,
with
the
same
abrupt
movement
,
closed
the
*NL*
door
of
ill
and
opened
the
door
of
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
put
a
stop
to
torture
,
promulgated
the
truth
,
expelled
miasma
,
*NL*
rendered
the
century
healthy
,
crowned
the
populace
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
said
of
it
that
it
created
man
a
second
time
,
by
giving
him
a
*NL*
second
soul
,
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nineteenth
century
has
inherited
and
profited
by
its
work
,
and
*NL*
to-day
,
the
social
catastrophe
to
which
we
lately
alluded
is
simply
*NL*
impossible
.
Blind
is
he
who
announces
it
!
Foolish
is
he
who
fears
it
!
*NL*
Revolution
is
the
vaccine
of
Jacquerie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
Revolution
,
social
conditions
have
changed
.
Feudal
and
*NL*
monarchical
maladies
no
longer
run
in
our
blood
.
There
is
no
more
of
*NL*
the
Middle
Ages
in
our
constitution
.
We
no
longer
live
in
the
days
when
*NL*
terrible
swarms
within
made
irruptions
,
when
one
heard
beneath
his
feet
*NL*
the
obscure
course
of
a
dull
rumble
,
when
indescribable
elevations
from
*NL*
mole-like
tunnels
appeared
on
the
surface
of
civilization
,
where
the
*NL*
soil
cracked
open
,
where
the
roofs
of
caverns
yawned
,
and
where
one
*NL*
suddenly
beheld
monstrous
heads
emerging
from
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
revolutionary
sense
is
a
moral
sense
.
The
sentiment
of
right
,
once
*NL*
developed
,
develops
the
sentiment
of
duty
.
The
law
of
all
is
*NL*
liberty
,
which
ends
where
the
liberty
of
others
begins
,
according
to
*NL*
Robespierre
's
admirable
definition
.
Since
'
89
,
the
whole
people
has
*NL*
been
dilating
into
a
sublime
individual
;
there
is
not
a
poor
man
,
who
,
*NL*
possessing
his
right
,
has
not
his
ray
of
sun
;
the
die-of-hunger
feels
*NL*
within
him
the
honesty
of
France
;
the
dignity
of
the
citizen
is
an
*NL*
internal
armor
;
he
who
is
free
is
scrupulous
;
he
who
votes
reigns
.
Hence
*NL*
incorruptibility
;
hence
the
miscarriage
of
unhealthy
lusts
;
hence
eyes
*NL*
heroically
lowered
before
temptations
.
The
revolutionary
wholesomeness
*NL*
is
such
,
that
on
a
day
of
deliverance
,
a
14th
of
July
,
a
10th
of
August
,
*NL*
there
is
no
longer
any
populace
.
The
first
cry
of
the
enlightened
and
*NL*
increasing
throngs
is
:
death
to
thieves
!
Progress
is
an
honest
man
;
the
*NL*
ideal
and
the
absolute
do
not
filch
pocket-handkerchiefs
.
By
whom
were
*NL*
the
wagons
containing
the
wealth
of
the
Tuileries
escorted
in
1848
?
By
*NL*
the
rag-pickers
of
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
.
Rags
mounted
guard
over
*NL*
the
treasure
.
Virtue
rendered
these
tatterdemalions
resplendent
.
In
*NL*
those
wagons
in
chests
,
hardly
closed
,
and
some
,
even
,
half-open
,
amid
a
*NL*
hundred
dazzling
caskets
,
was
that
ancient
crown
of
France
,
studded
with
*NL*
diamonds
,
surmounted
by
the
carbuncle
of
royalty
,
by
the
Regent
diamond
,
*NL*
which
was
worth
thirty
millions
.
Barefooted
,
they
guarded
that
crown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
,
no
more
Jacquerie
.
I
regret
it
for
the
sake
of
the
skilful
.
The
*NL*
old
fear
has
produced
its
last
effects
in
that
quarter
;
and
henceforth
*NL*
it
can
no
longer
be
employed
in
politics
.
The
principal
spring
of
the
*NL*
red
spectre
is
broken
.
Every
one
knows
it
now
.
The
scare-crow
scares
*NL*
no
longer
.
The
birds
take
liberties
with
the
mannikin
,
foul
creatures
*NL*
alight
upon
it
,
the
bourgeois
laugh
at
it
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
TWO
DUTIES
:
TO
WATCH
AND
TO
HOPE
*NL*
*NL*
This
being
the
case
,
is
all
social
danger
dispelled
?
Certainly
not
.
*NL*
There
is
no
Jacquerie
;
society
may
rest
assured
on
that
point
;
blood
*NL*
will
no
longer
rush
to
its
head
.
But
let
society
take
heed
to
the
manner
*NL*
in
which
it
breathes
.
Apoplexy
is
no
longer
to
be
feared
,
but
phthisis
*NL*
is
there
.
Social
phthisis
is
called
misery
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
can
perish
from
being
undermined
as
well
as
from
being
struck
by
*NL*
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
not
weary
of
repeating
,
and
sympathetic
souls
must
not
forget
*NL*
that
this
is
the
first
of
fraternal
obligations
,
and
selfish
hearts
must
*NL*
understand
that
the
first
of
political
necessities
consists
in
thinking
*NL*
first
of
all
of
the
disinherited
and
sorrowing
throngs
,
in
solacing
,
*NL*
airing
,
enlightening
,
loving
them
,
in
enlarging
their
horizon
to
a
*NL*
magnificent
extent
,
in
lavishing
upon
them
education
in
every
form
,
in
*NL*
offering
them
the
example
of
labor
,
never
the
example
of
idleness
,
*NL*
in
diminishing
the
individual
burden
by
enlarging
the
notion
of
the
*NL*
universal
aim
,
in
setting
a
limit
to
poverty
without
setting
a
limit
*NL*
to
wealth
,
in
creating
vast
fields
of
public
and
popular
activity
,
in
*NL*
having
,
like
Briareus
,
a
hundred
hands
to
extend
in
all
directions
to
*NL*
the
oppressed
and
the
feeble
,
in
employing
the
collective
power
for
that
*NL*
grand
duty
of
opening
workshops
for
all
arms
,
schools
for
all
aptitudes
,
*NL*
and
laboratories
for
all
degrees
of
intelligence
,
in
augmenting
*NL*
salaries
,
diminishing
trouble
,
balancing
what
should
be
and
what
is
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
in
proportioning
enjoyment
to
effort
and
a
glut
to
need
;
*NL*
in
a
word
,
in
evolving
from
the
social
apparatus
more
light
and
more
*NL*
comfort
for
the
benefit
of
those
who
suffer
and
those
who
are
ignorant
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
let
us
say
it
,
all
this
is
but
the
beginning
.
The
true
question
is
*NL*
this
:
labor
can
not
be
a
law
without
being
a
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
not
insist
upon
this
point
;
this
is
not
the
proper
place
for
*NL*
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
nature
calls
itself
Providence
,
society
should
call
itself
foresight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Intellectual
and
moral
growth
is
no
less
indispensable
than
material
*NL*
improvement
.
To
know
is
a
sacrament
,
to
think
is
the
prime
necessity
,
*NL*
truth
is
nourishment
as
well
as
grain
.
A
reason
which
fasts
from
science
*NL*
and
wisdom
grows
thin
.
Let
us
enter
equal
complaint
against
stomachs
and
*NL*
minds
which
do
not
eat
.
If
there
is
anything
more
heart-breaking
than
*NL*
a
body
perishing
for
lack
of
bread
,
it
is
a
soul
which
is
dying
from
*NL*
hunger
for
the
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
progress
tends
in
the
direction
of
solution
.
Some
day
we
*NL*
shall
be
amazed
.
As
the
human
race
mounts
upward
,
the
deep
layers
emerge
*NL*
naturally
from
the
zone
of
distress
.
The
obliteration
of
misery
will
be
*NL*
accomplished
by
a
simple
elevation
of
level
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
should
do
wrong
were
we
to
doubt
this
blessed
consummation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
past
is
very
strong
,
it
is
true
,
at
the
present
moment
.
It
censures
.
*NL*
This
rejuvenation
of
a
corpse
is
surprising
.
Behold
,
it
is
walking
and
*NL*
advancing
.
It
seems
a
victor
;
this
dead
body
is
a
conqueror
.
He
arrives
*NL*
with
his
legions
,
superstitions
,
with
his
sword
,
despotism
,
with
his
*NL*
banner
,
ignorance
;
a
while
ago
,
he
won
ten
battles
.
He
advances
,
he
*NL*
threatens
,
he
laughs
,
he
is
at
our
doors
.
Let
us
not
despair
,
on
our
*NL*
side
.
Let
us
sell
the
field
on
which
Hannibal
is
encamped
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
have
we
to
fear
,
we
who
believe
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
such
thing
as
a
back-flow
of
ideas
exists
any
more
than
there
exists
*NL*
a
return
of
a
river
on
its
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
let
those
who
do
not
desire
a
future
reflect
on
this
matter
.
When
*NL*
they
say
``
no
''
to
progress
,
it
is
not
the
future
but
themselves
that
*NL*
they
are
condemning
.
They
are
giving
themselves
a
sad
malady
;
they
are
*NL*
inoculating
themselves
with
the
past
.
There
is
but
one
way
of
rejecting
*NL*
To-morrow
,
and
that
is
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
no
death
,
that
of
the
body
as
late
as
possible
,
that
of
the
soul
*NL*
never
,
--
this
is
what
we
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
the
enigma
will
utter
its
word
,
the
sphinx
will
speak
,
the
problem
*NL*
will
be
solved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
the
people
,
sketched
out
by
the
eighteenth
century
,
will
be
*NL*
finished
by
the
nineteenth
.
He
who
doubts
this
is
an
idiot
!
The
future
*NL*
blossoming
,
the
near
blossoming
forth
of
universal
well-being
,
is
a
*NL*
divinely
fatal
phenomenon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immense
combined
propulsions
direct
human
affairs
and
conduct
them
*NL*
within
a
given
time
to
a
logical
state
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
a
state
of
*NL*
equilibrium
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
equity
.
A
force
composed
of
earth
and
*NL*
heaven
results
from
humanity
and
governs
it
;
this
force
is
a
worker
*NL*
of
miracles
;
marvellous
issues
are
no
more
difficult
to
it
than
*NL*
extraordinary
vicissitudes
.
Aided
by
science
,
which
comes
from
one
man
,
*NL*
and
by
the
event
,
which
comes
from
another
,
it
is
not
greatly
alarmed
*NL*
by
these
contradictions
in
the
attitude
of
problems
,
which
seem
*NL*
impossibilities
to
the
vulgar
herd
.
It
is
no
less
skilful
at
causing
a
*NL*
solution
to
spring
forth
from
the
reconciliation
of
ideas
,
than
a
lesson
*NL*
from
the
reconciliation
of
facts
,
and
we
may
expect
anything
from
that
*NL*
mysterious
power
of
progress
,
which
brought
the
Orient
and
the
Occident
*NL*
face
to
face
one
fine
day
,
in
the
depths
of
a
sepulchre
,
and
made
the
*NL*
imaums
converse
with
Bonaparte
in
the
interior
of
the
Great
Pyramid
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
let
there
be
no
halt
,
no
hesitation
,
no
pause
in
the
*NL*
grandiose
onward
march
of
minds
.
Social
philosophy
consists
essentially
*NL*
in
science
and
peace
.
Its
object
is
,
and
its
result
must
be
,
to
dissolve
*NL*
wrath
by
the
study
of
antagonisms
.
It
examines
,
it
scrutinizes
,
it
*NL*
analyzes
;
then
it
puts
together
once
more
,
it
proceeds
by
means
of
*NL*
reduction
,
discarding
all
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
than
once
,
a
society
has
been
seen
to
give
way
before
the
wind
*NL*
which
is
let
loose
upon
mankind
;
history
is
full
of
the
shipwrecks
of
*NL*
nations
and
empires
;
manners
,
customs
,
laws
,
religions
,
--
and
some
fine
*NL*
day
that
unknown
force
,
the
hurricane
,
passes
by
and
bears
them
all
*NL*
away
.
The
civilizations
of
India
,
of
Chaldea
,
of
Persia
,
of
Syria
,
of
*NL*
Egypt
,
have
disappeared
one
after
the
other
.
Why
?
We
know
not
.
What
are
*NL*
the
causes
of
these
disasters
?
We
do
not
know
.
Could
these
societies
*NL*
have
been
saved
?
Was
it
their
fault
?
Did
they
persist
in
the
fatal
vice
*NL*
which
destroyed
them
?
What
is
the
amount
of
suicide
in
these
terrible
*NL*
deaths
of
a
nation
and
a
race
?
Questions
to
which
there
exists
no
reply
.
*NL*
Darkness
enwraps
condemned
civilizations
.
They
sprung
a
leak
,
then
they
*NL*
sank
.
We
have
nothing
more
to
say
;
and
it
is
with
a
sort
of
terror
that
*NL*
we
look
on
,
at
the
bottom
of
that
sea
which
is
called
the
past
,
behind
*NL*
those
colossal
waves
,
at
the
shipwreck
of
those
immense
vessels
,
*NL*
Babylon
,
Nineveh
,
Tarsus
,
Thebes
,
Rome
,
beneath
the
fearful
gusts
which
*NL*
emerge
from
all
the
mouths
of
the
shadows
.
But
shadows
are
there
,
and
*NL*
light
is
here
.
We
are
not
acquainted
with
the
maladies
of
these
ancient
*NL*
civilizations
,
we
do
not
know
the
infirmities
of
our
own
.
Everywhere
*NL*
upon
it
we
have
the
right
of
light
,
we
contemplate
its
beauties
,
we
*NL*
lay
bare
its
defects
.
Where
it
is
ill
,
we
probe
;
and
the
sickness
once
*NL*
diagnosed
,
the
study
of
the
cause
leads
to
the
discovery
of
the
remedy
.
*NL*
Our
civilization
,
the
work
of
twenty
centuries
,
is
its
law
and
its
*NL*
prodigy
;
it
is
worth
the
trouble
of
saving
.
It
will
be
saved
.
It
is
*NL*
already
much
to
have
solaced
it
;
its
enlightenment
is
yet
another
point
.
*NL*
All
the
labors
of
modern
social
philosophies
must
converge
towards
*NL*
this
point
.
The
thinker
of
to-day
has
a
great
duty
--
to
auscultate
*NL*
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
repeat
,
that
this
auscultation
brings
encouragement
;
it
is
by
this
*NL*
persistence
in
encouragement
that
we
wish
to
conclude
these
pages
,
an
*NL*
austere
interlude
in
a
mournful
drama
.
Beneath
the
social
mortality
,
we
*NL*
feel
human
imperishableness
.
The
globe
does
not
perish
,
because
it
has
*NL*
these
wounds
,
craters
,
eruptions
,
sulphur
pits
,
here
and
there
,
nor
*NL*
because
of
a
volcano
which
ejects
its
pus
.
The
maladies
of
the
people
do
*NL*
not
kill
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
any
one
who
follows
the
course
of
social
clinics
shakes
his
*NL*
head
at
times
.
The
strongest
,
the
tenderest
,
the
most
logical
have
their
*NL*
hours
of
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Will
the
future
arrive
?
It
seems
as
though
we
might
almost
put
*NL*
this
question
,
when
we
behold
so
much
terrible
darkness
.
Melancholy
*NL*
face-to-face
encounter
of
selfish
and
wretched
.
On
the
part
of
*NL*
the
selfish
,
the
prejudices
,
shadows
of
costly
education
,
appetite
*NL*
increasing
through
intoxication
,
a
giddiness
of
prosperity
which
dulls
,
*NL*
a
fear
of
suffering
which
,
in
some
,
goes
as
far
as
an
aversion
for
the
*NL*
suffering
,
an
implacable
satisfaction
,
the
I
so
swollen
that
it
bars
the
*NL*
soul
;
on
the
side
of
the
wretched
covetousness
,
envy
,
hatred
of
seeing
*NL*
others
enjoy
,
the
profound
impulses
of
the
human
beast
towards
assuaging
*NL*
its
desires
,
hearts
full
of
mist
,
sadness
,
need
,
fatality
,
impure
and
*NL*
simple
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shall
we
continue
to
raise
our
eyes
to
heaven
?
is
the
luminous
point
*NL*
which
we
distinguish
there
one
of
those
which
vanish
?
The
ideal
*NL*
is
frightful
to
behold
,
thus
lost
in
the
depths
,
small
,
isolated
,
*NL*
imperceptible
,
brilliant
,
but
surrounded
by
those
great
,
black
menaces
,
*NL*
monstrously
heaped
around
it
;
yet
no
more
in
danger
than
a
star
in
the
*NL*
maw
of
the
clouds
.

CHAPTER
I
--
FULL
LIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
probably
understood
that
Eponine
,
having
recognized
*NL*
through
the
gate
,
the
inhabitant
of
that
Rue
Plumet
whither
Magnon
had
*NL*
sent
her
,
had
begun
by
keeping
the
ruffians
away
from
the
Rue
Plumet
,
*NL*
and
had
then
conducted
Marius
thither
,
and
that
,
after
many
days
spent
*NL*
in
ecstasy
before
that
gate
,
Marius
,
drawn
on
by
that
force
which
draws
*NL*
the
iron
to
the
magnet
and
a
lover
towards
the
stones
of
which
is
built
*NL*
the
house
of
her
whom
he
loves
,
had
finally
entered
Cosette
's
garden
as
*NL*
Romeo
entered
the
garden
of
Juliet
.
This
had
even
proved
easier
for
him
*NL*
than
for
Romeo
;
Romeo
was
obliged
to
scale
a
wall
,
Marius
had
only
*NL*
to
use
a
little
force
on
one
of
the
bars
of
the
decrepit
gate
which
*NL*
vacillated
in
its
rusty
recess
,
after
the
fashion
of
old
people
's
teeth
.
*NL*
Marius
was
slender
and
readily
passed
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
was
never
any
one
in
the
street
,
and
as
Marius
never
entered
*NL*
the
garden
except
at
night
,
he
ran
no
risk
of
being
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beginning
with
that
blessed
and
holy
hour
when
a
kiss
betrothed
these
*NL*
two
souls
,
Marius
was
there
every
evening
.
If
,
at
that
period
of
*NL*
her
existence
,
Cosette
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
man
in
the
least
*NL*
unscrupulous
or
debauched
,
she
would
have
been
lost
;
for
there
are
*NL*
generous
natures
which
yield
themselves
,
and
Cosette
was
one
of
them
.
*NL*
One
of
woman
's
magnanimities
is
to
yield
.
Love
,
at
the
height
where
it
*NL*
is
absolute
,
is
complicated
with
some
indescribably
celestial
blindness
*NL*
of
modesty
.
But
what
dangers
you
run
,
O
noble
souls
!
Often
you
give
the
*NL*
heart
,
and
we
take
the
body
.
Your
heart
remains
with
you
,
you
gaze
upon
*NL*
it
in
the
gloom
with
a
shudder
.
Love
has
no
middle
course
;
it
either
*NL*
ruins
or
it
saves
.
All
human
destiny
lies
in
this
dilemma
.
This
dilemma
,
*NL*
ruin
,
or
safety
,
is
set
forth
no
more
inexorably
by
any
fatality
than
*NL*
by
love
.
Love
is
life
,
if
it
is
not
death
.
Cradle
;
also
coffin
.
The
same
*NL*
sentiment
says
``
yes
''
and
``
no
''
in
the
human
heart
.
Of
all
the
things
that
*NL*
God
has
made
,
the
human
heart
is
the
one
which
sheds
the
most
light
,
*NL*
alas
!
and
the
most
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
God
willed
that
Cosette
's
love
should
encounter
one
of
the
loves
which
*NL*
save
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
whole
of
the
month
of
May
of
that
year
1832
,
there
were
*NL*
there
,
in
every
night
,
in
that
poor
,
neglected
garden
,
beneath
that
*NL*
thicket
which
grew
thicker
and
more
fragrant
day
by
day
,
two
beings
*NL*
composed
of
all
chastity
,
all
innocence
,
overflowing
with
all
the
*NL*
felicity
of
heaven
,
nearer
to
the
archangels
than
to
mankind
,
pure
,
*NL*
honest
,
intoxicated
,
radiant
,
who
shone
for
each
other
amid
the
shadows
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
Cosette
that
Marius
had
a
crown
,
and
to
Marius
that
Cosette
*NL*
had
a
nimbus
.
They
touched
each
other
,
they
gazed
at
each
other
,
they
*NL*
clasped
each
other
's
hands
,
they
pressed
close
to
each
other
;
but
there
*NL*
was
a
distance
which
they
did
not
pass
.
Not
that
they
respected
it
;
*NL*
they
did
not
know
of
its
existence
.
Marius
was
conscious
of
a
barrier
,
*NL*
Cosette
's
innocence
;
and
Cosette
of
a
support
,
Marius
'
loyalty
.
The
*NL*
first
kiss
had
also
been
the
last
.
Marius
,
since
that
time
,
had
not
gone
*NL*
further
than
to
touch
Cosette
's
hand
,
or
her
kerchief
,
or
a
lock
of
her
*NL*
hair
,
with
his
lips
.
For
him
,
Cosette
was
a
perfume
and
not
a
woman
.
*NL*
He
inhaled
her
.
She
refused
nothing
,
and
he
asked
nothing
.
Cosette
was
*NL*
happy
,
and
Marius
was
satisfied
.
They
lived
in
this
ecstatic
state
which
*NL*
can
be
described
as
the
dazzling
of
one
soul
by
another
soul
.
It
was
*NL*
the
ineffable
first
embrace
of
two
maiden
souls
in
the
ideal
.
Two
swans
*NL*
meeting
on
the
Jungfrau
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
hour
of
love
,
an
hour
when
voluptuousness
is
absolutely
mute
,
*NL*
beneath
the
omnipotence
of
ecstasy
,
Marius
,
the
pure
and
seraphic
*NL*
Marius
,
would
rather
have
gone
to
a
woman
of
the
town
than
have
raised
*NL*
Cosette
's
robe
to
the
height
of
her
ankle
.
Once
,
in
the
moonlight
,
*NL*
Cosette
stooped
to
pick
up
something
on
the
ground
,
her
bodice
fell
*NL*
apart
and
permitted
a
glimpse
of
the
beginning
of
her
throat
.
Marius
*NL*
turned
away
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
took
place
between
these
two
beings
?
Nothing
.
They
adored
each
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
night
,
when
they
were
there
,
that
garden
seemed
a
living
and
a
sacred
*NL*
spot
.
All
flowers
unfolded
around
them
and
sent
them
incense
;
and
they
*NL*
opened
their
souls
and
scattered
them
over
the
flowers
.
The
wanton
and
*NL*
vigorous
vegetation
quivered
,
full
of
strength
and
intoxication
,
around
*NL*
these
two
innocents
,
and
they
uttered
words
of
love
which
set
the
trees
*NL*
to
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
words
were
these
?
Breaths
.
Nothing
more
.
These
breaths
sufficed
to
*NL*
trouble
and
to
touch
all
nature
round
about
.
Magic
power
which
we
*NL*
should
find
it
difficult
to
understand
were
we
to
read
in
a
book
these
*NL*
conversations
which
are
made
to
be
borne
away
and
dispersed
like
smoke
*NL*
wreaths
by
the
breeze
beneath
the
leaves
.
Take
from
those
murmurs
of
two
*NL*
lovers
that
melody
which
proceeds
from
the
soul
and
which
accompanies
*NL*
them
like
a
lyre
,
and
what
remains
is
nothing
more
than
a
shade
;
you
*NL*
say
:
``
What
!
is
that
all
!
''
eh
!
yes
,
childish
prattle
,
repetitions
,
*NL*
laughter
at
nothing
,
nonsense
,
everything
that
is
deepest
and
most
*NL*
sublime
in
the
world
!
The
only
things
which
are
worth
the
trouble
of
*NL*
saying
and
hearing
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
has
never
heard
,
the
man
who
has
never
uttered
these
*NL*
absurdities
,
these
paltry
remarks
,
is
an
imbecile
and
a
malicious
*NL*
fellow
.
Cosette
said
to
Marius
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
?
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
In
all
this
and
athwart
this
celestial
maidenliness
,
and
without
either
*NL*
of
them
being
able
to
say
how
it
had
come
about
,
they
had
begun
to
call
*NL*
each
other
thou
.
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dost
thou
know
?
My
name
is
Euphrasie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Euphrasie
?
Why
,
no
,
thy
name
is
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Cosette
is
a
very
ugly
name
that
was
given
to
me
when
I
was
*NL*
a
little
thing
.
But
my
real
name
is
Euphrasie
.
Dost
thou
like
that
*NL*
name
--
Euphrasie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
Cosette
is
not
ugly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
it
better
than
Euphrasie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
like
it
better
too
.
Truly
,
it
is
pretty
,
Cosette
.
Call
me
*NL*
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
smile
that
she
added
made
of
this
dialogue
an
idyl
worthy
of
a
*NL*
grove
situated
in
heaven
.
On
another
occasion
she
gazed
intently
at
him
*NL*
and
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
you
are
handsome
,
you
are
good-looking
,
you
are
witty
,
you
*NL*
are
not
at
all
stupid
,
you
are
much
more
learned
than
I
am
,
but
I
bid
*NL*
you
defiance
with
this
word
:
I
love
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Marius
,
in
the
very
heavens
,
thought
he
heard
a
strain
sung
by
a
*NL*
star
.
*NL*
*NL*
Or
she
bestowed
on
him
a
gentle
tap
because
he
coughed
,
and
she
said
to
*NL*
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cough
,
sir
;
I
will
not
have
people
cough
on
my
domain
without
my
*NL*
permission
.
It
's
very
naughty
to
cough
and
to
disturb
me
.
I
want
you
to
*NL*
be
well
,
because
,
in
the
first
place
,
if
you
were
not
well
,
I
should
be
*NL*
very
unhappy
.
What
should
I
do
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
was
simply
divine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
Marius
said
to
Cosette
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
imagine
,
I
thought
at
one
time
that
your
name
was
Ursule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
made
both
of
them
laugh
the
whole
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
another
conversation
,
he
chanced
to
exclaim
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
One
day
,
at
the
Luxembourg
,
I
had
a
good
mind
to
finish
breaking
*NL*
up
a
veteran
!
''
But
he
stopped
short
,
and
went
no
further
.
He
would
have
*NL*
been
obliged
to
speak
to
Cosette
of
her
garter
,
and
that
was
impossible
.
*NL*
This
bordered
on
a
strange
theme
,
the
flesh
,
before
which
that
immense
*NL*
and
innocent
love
recoiled
with
a
sort
of
sacred
fright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
pictured
life
with
Cosette
to
himself
like
this
,
without
anything
*NL*
else
;
to
come
every
evening
to
the
Rue
Plumet
,
to
displace
the
old
and
*NL*
accommodating
bar
of
the
chief-justice
's
gate
,
to
sit
elbow
to
elbow
*NL*
on
that
bench
,
to
gaze
through
the
trees
at
the
scintillation
of
the
*NL*
on-coming
night
,
to
fit
a
fold
of
the
knee
of
his
trousers
into
the
*NL*
ample
fall
of
Cosette
's
gown
,
to
caress
her
thumb-nail
,
to
call
her
*NL*
thou
,
to
smell
of
the
same
flower
,
one
after
the
other
,
forever
,
*NL*
indefinitely
.
During
this
time
,
clouds
passed
above
their
heads
.
Every
*NL*
time
that
the
wind
blows
it
bears
with
it
more
of
the
dreams
of
men
than
*NL*
of
the
clouds
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
chaste
,
almost
shy
love
was
not
devoid
of
gallantry
,
by
any
means
.
*NL*
To
pay
compliments
to
the
woman
whom
a
man
loves
is
the
first
method
of
*NL*
bestowing
caresses
,
and
he
is
half
audacious
who
tries
it
.
A
compliment
*NL*
is
something
like
a
kiss
through
a
veil
.
Voluptuousness
mingles
there
*NL*
with
its
sweet
tiny
point
,
while
it
hides
itself
.
The
heart
draws
back
*NL*
before
voluptuousness
only
to
love
the
more
.
Marius
'
blandishments
,
all
*NL*
saturated
with
fancy
,
were
,
so
to
speak
,
of
azure
hue
.
The
birds
when
*NL*
they
fly
up
yonder
,
in
the
direction
of
the
angels
,
must
hear
such
*NL*
words
.
There
were
mingled
with
them
,
nevertheless
,
life
,
humanity
,
all
*NL*
the
positiveness
of
which
Marius
was
capable
.
It
was
what
is
said
in
*NL*
the
bower
,
a
prelude
to
what
will
be
said
in
the
chamber
;
a
lyrical
*NL*
effusion
,
strophe
and
sonnet
intermingled
,
pleasing
hyperboles
of
*NL*
cooing
,
all
the
refinements
of
adoration
arranged
in
a
bouquet
and
*NL*
exhaling
a
celestial
perfume
,
an
ineffable
twitter
of
heart
to
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
murmured
Marius
,
``
how
beautiful
you
are
!
I
dare
not
look
at
you
.
*NL*
It
is
all
over
with
me
when
I
contemplate
you
.
You
are
a
grace
.
I
know
*NL*
not
what
is
the
matter
with
me
.
The
hem
of
your
gown
,
when
the
tip
of
*NL*
your
shoe
peeps
from
beneath
,
upsets
me
.
And
then
,
what
an
enchanted
*NL*
gleam
when
you
open
your
thought
even
but
a
little
!
You
talk
*NL*
astonishingly
good
sense
.
It
seems
to
me
at
times
that
you
are
a
*NL*
dream
.
Speak
,
I
listen
,
I
admire
.
Oh
Cosette
!
how
strange
it
is
and
how
*NL*
charming
!
I
am
really
beside
myself
.
You
are
adorable
,
Mademoiselle
.
I
*NL*
study
your
feet
with
the
microscope
and
your
soul
with
the
telescope
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Cosette
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
loving
a
little
more
all
the
time
that
has
passed
since
*NL*
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Questions
and
replies
took
care
of
themselves
in
this
dialogue
,
which
*NL*
always
turned
with
mutual
consent
upon
love
,
as
the
little
pith
figures
*NL*
always
turn
on
their
peg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
's
whole
person
was
ingenuousness
,
ingenuity
,
transparency
,
*NL*
whiteness
,
candor
,
radiance
.
It
might
have
been
said
of
Cosette
that
she
*NL*
was
clear
.
She
produced
on
those
who
saw
her
the
sensation
of
April
*NL*
and
dawn
.
There
was
dew
in
her
eyes
.
Cosette
was
a
condensation
of
the
*NL*
auroral
light
in
the
form
of
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
simple
that
Marius
should
admire
her
,
since
he
adored
her
.
*NL*
But
the
truth
is
,
that
this
little
school-girl
,
fresh
from
the
convent
,
*NL*
talked
with
exquisite
penetration
and
uttered
,
at
times
,
all
sorts
of
*NL*
true
and
delicate
sayings
.
Her
prattle
was
conversation
.
She
never
made
*NL*
a
mistake
about
anything
,
and
she
saw
things
justly
.
The
woman
feels
and
*NL*
speaks
with
the
tender
instinct
of
the
heart
,
which
is
infallible
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
understands
so
well
as
a
woman
,
how
to
say
things
that
are
,
at
*NL*
once
,
both
sweet
and
deep
.
Sweetness
and
depth
,
they
are
the
whole
of
*NL*
woman
;
in
them
lies
the
whole
of
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
full
felicity
,
tears
welled
up
to
their
eyes
every
instant
.
A
*NL*
crushed
lady-bug
,
a
feather
fallen
from
a
nest
,
a
branch
of
hawthorn
*NL*
broken
,
aroused
their
pity
,
and
their
ecstasy
,
sweetly
mingled
with
*NL*
melancholy
,
seemed
to
ask
nothing
better
than
to
weep
.
The
most
*NL*
sovereign
symptom
of
love
is
a
tenderness
that
is
,
at
times
,
almost
*NL*
unbearable
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
in
addition
to
this
,
--
all
these
contradictions
are
the
lightning
*NL*
play
of
love
,
--
they
were
fond
of
laughing
,
they
laughed
readily
and
with
*NL*
a
delicious
freedom
,
and
so
familiarly
that
they
sometimes
presented
the
*NL*
air
of
two
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
though
unknown
to
hearts
intoxicated
with
purity
,
nature
is
*NL*
always
present
and
will
not
be
forgotten
.
She
is
there
with
her
brutal
*NL*
and
sublime
object
;
and
however
great
may
be
the
innocence
of
souls
,
one
*NL*
feels
in
the
most
modest
private
interview
,
the
adorable
and
mysterious
*NL*
shade
which
separates
a
couple
of
lovers
from
a
pair
of
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
idolized
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
permanent
and
the
immutable
are
persistent
.
People
live
,
they
smile
,
*NL*
they
laugh
,
they
make
little
grimaces
with
the
tips
of
their
lips
,
they
*NL*
interlace
their
fingers
,
they
call
each
other
thou
,
and
that
does
not
*NL*
prevent
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
lovers
hide
themselves
in
the
evening
,
in
the
twilight
,
in
the
*NL*
invisible
,
with
the
birds
,
with
the
roses
;
they
fascinate
each
other
in
*NL*
the
darkness
with
their
hearts
which
they
throw
into
their
eyes
,
they
*NL*
murmur
,
they
whisper
,
and
in
the
meantime
,
immense
librations
of
the
*NL*
planets
fill
the
infinite
universe
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
BEWILDERMENT
OF
PERFECT
HAPPINESS
*NL*
*NL*
They
existed
vaguely
,
frightened
at
their
happiness
.
They
did
not
notice
*NL*
the
cholera
which
decimated
Paris
precisely
during
that
very
month
.
They
*NL*
had
confided
in
each
other
as
far
as
possible
,
but
this
had
not
extended
*NL*
much
further
than
their
names
.
Marius
had
told
Cosette
that
he
was
an
*NL*
orphan
,
that
his
name
was
Marius
Pontmercy
,
that
he
was
a
lawyer
,
that
*NL*
he
lived
by
writing
things
for
publishers
,
that
his
father
had
been
a
*NL*
colonel
,
that
the
latter
had
been
a
hero
,
and
that
he
,
Marius
,
was
on
*NL*
bad
terms
with
his
grandfather
who
was
rich
.
He
had
also
hinted
at
being
*NL*
a
baron
,
but
this
had
produced
no
effect
on
Cosette
.
She
did
not
*NL*
know
the
meaning
of
the
word
.
Marius
was
Marius
.
On
her
side
,
she
*NL*
had
confided
to
him
that
she
had
been
brought
up
at
the
Petit-Picpus
*NL*
convent
,
that
her
mother
,
like
his
own
,
was
dead
,
that
her
father
's
name
*NL*
was
M.
Fauchelevent
,
that
he
was
very
good
,
that
he
gave
a
great
deal
*NL*
to
the
poor
,
but
that
he
was
poor
himself
,
and
that
he
denied
himself
*NL*
everything
though
he
denied
her
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
in
the
sort
of
symphony
which
Marius
had
lived
since
he
*NL*
had
been
in
the
habit
of
seeing
Cosette
,
the
past
,
even
the
most
recent
*NL*
past
,
had
become
so
confused
and
distant
to
him
,
that
what
Cosette
told
*NL*
him
satisfied
him
completely
.
It
did
not
even
occur
to
him
to
tell
her
*NL*
about
the
nocturnal
adventure
in
the
hovel
,
about
Thenardier
,
about
the
*NL*
burn
,
and
about
the
strange
attitude
and
singular
flight
of
her
father
.
*NL*
Marius
had
momentarily
forgotten
all
this
;
in
the
evening
he
did
not
*NL*
even
know
that
there
had
been
a
morning
,
what
he
had
done
,
where
he
had
*NL*
breakfasted
,
nor
who
had
spoken
to
him
;
he
had
songs
in
his
ears
which
*NL*
rendered
him
deaf
to
every
other
thought
;
he
only
existed
at
the
hours
*NL*
when
he
saw
Cosette
.
Then
,
as
he
was
in
heaven
,
it
was
quite
natural
*NL*
that
he
should
forget
earth
.
Both
bore
languidly
the
indefinable
burden
*NL*
of
immaterial
pleasures
.
Thus
lived
these
somnambulists
who
are
called
*NL*
lovers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
Who
is
there
who
has
not
felt
all
these
things
?
Why
does
there
*NL*
come
an
hour
when
one
emerges
from
this
azure
,
and
why
does
life
go
on
*NL*
afterwards
?
*NL*
*NL*
Loving
almost
takes
the
place
of
thinking
.
Love
is
an
ardent
*NL*
forgetfulness
of
all
the
rest
.
Then
ask
logic
of
passion
if
you
will
.
*NL*
There
is
no
more
absolute
logical
sequence
in
the
human
heart
than
there
*NL*
is
a
perfect
geometrical
figure
in
the
celestial
mechanism
.
For
Cosette
*NL*
and
Marius
nothing
existed
except
Marius
and
Cosette
.
The
universe
*NL*
around
them
had
fallen
into
a
hole
.
They
lived
in
a
golden
minute
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
before
them
,
nothing
behind
.
It
hardly
occurred
to
Marius
*NL*
that
Cosette
had
a
father
.
His
brain
was
dazzled
and
obliterated
.
Of
*NL*
what
did
these
lovers
talk
then
?
We
have
seen
,
of
the
flowers
,
and
*NL*
the
swallows
,
the
setting
sun
and
the
rising
moon
,
and
all
sorts
of
*NL*
important
things
.
They
had
told
each
other
everything
except
everything
.
*NL*
The
everything
of
lovers
is
nothing
.
But
the
father
,
the
realities
,
that
*NL*
lair
,
the
ruffians
,
that
adventure
,
to
what
purpose
?
And
was
he
very
*NL*
sure
that
this
nightmare
had
actually
existed
?
They
were
two
,
and
they
*NL*
adored
each
other
,
and
beyond
that
there
was
nothing
.
Nothing
else
*NL*
existed
.
It
is
probable
that
this
vanishing
of
hell
in
our
rear
is
*NL*
inherent
to
the
arrival
of
paradise
.
Have
we
beheld
demons
?
Are
there
*NL*
any
?
Have
we
trembled
?
Have
we
suffered
?
We
no
longer
know
.
A
rosy
cloud
*NL*
hangs
over
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
these
two
beings
lived
in
this
manner
,
high
aloft
,
with
all
that
*NL*
improbability
which
is
in
nature
;
neither
at
the
nadir
nor
at
the
*NL*
zenith
,
between
man
and
seraphim
,
above
the
mire
,
below
the
ether
,
in
*NL*
the
clouds
;
hardly
flesh
and
blood
,
soul
and
ecstasy
from
head
to
foot
;
*NL*
already
too
sublime
to
walk
the
earth
,
still
too
heavily
charged
with
*NL*
humanity
to
disappear
in
the
blue
,
suspended
like
atoms
which
are
*NL*
waiting
to
be
precipitated
;
apparently
beyond
the
bounds
of
destiny
;
*NL*
ignorant
of
that
rut
;
yesterday
,
to-day
,
to-morrow
;
amazed
,
rapturous
,
*NL*
floating
,
soaring
;
at
times
so
light
that
they
could
take
their
flight
*NL*
out
into
the
infinite
;
almost
prepared
to
soar
away
to
all
eternity
.
*NL*
They
slept
wide-awake
,
thus
sweetly
lulled
.
Oh
!
splendid
lethargy
of
the
*NL*
real
overwhelmed
by
the
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
,
beautiful
as
Cosette
was
,
Marius
shut
his
eyes
in
her
*NL*
presence
.
The
best
way
to
look
at
the
soul
is
through
closed
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
and
Cosette
never
asked
themselves
whither
this
was
to
lead
them
.
*NL*
They
considered
that
they
had
already
arrived
.
It
is
a
strange
claim
on
*NL*
man
's
part
to
wish
that
love
should
lead
to
something
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
BEGINNING
OF
SHADOW
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
suspected
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
who
was
rather
less
dreamy
than
Marius
,
was
gay
,
and
that
*NL*
sufficed
for
Jean
Valjean
's
happiness
.
The
thoughts
which
Cosette
*NL*
cherished
,
her
tender
preoccupations
,
Marius
'
image
which
filled
her
*NL*
heart
,
took
away
nothing
from
the
incomparable
purity
of
her
beautiful
,
*NL*
chaste
,
and
smiling
brow
.
She
was
at
the
age
when
the
virgin
bears
her
*NL*
love
as
the
angel
his
lily
.
So
Jean
Valjean
was
at
ease
.
And
then
,
when
*NL*
two
lovers
have
come
to
an
understanding
,
things
always
go
well
;
the
*NL*
third
party
who
might
disturb
their
love
is
kept
in
a
state
of
perfect
*NL*
blindness
by
a
restricted
number
of
precautions
which
are
always
the
*NL*
same
in
the
case
of
all
lovers
.
Thus
,
Cosette
never
objected
to
any
of
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
proposals
.
Did
she
want
to
take
a
walk
?
``
Yes
,
dear
little
*NL*
father
.
''
Did
she
want
to
stay
at
home
?
Very
good
.
Did
he
wish
to
pass
*NL*
the
evening
with
Cosette
?
She
was
delighted
.
As
he
always
went
to
bed
at
*NL*
ten
o'clock
,
Marius
did
not
come
to
the
garden
on
such
occasions
until
*NL*
after
that
hour
,
when
,
from
the
street
,
he
heard
Cosette
open
the
long
*NL*
glass
door
on
the
veranda
.
Of
course
,
no
one
ever
met
Marius
in
the
*NL*
daytime
.
Jean
Valjean
never
even
dreamed
any
longer
that
Marius
was
in
*NL*
existence
.
Only
once
,
one
morning
,
he
chanced
to
say
to
Cosette
:
``
Why
,
*NL*
you
have
whitewash
on
your
back
!
''
On
the
previous
evening
,
Marius
,
in
a
*NL*
transport
,
had
pushed
Cosette
against
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
Toussaint
,
who
retired
early
,
thought
of
nothing
but
her
sleep
,
and
*NL*
was
as
ignorant
of
the
whole
matter
as
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
never
set
foot
in
the
house
.
When
he
was
with
Cosette
,
they
hid
*NL*
themselves
in
a
recess
near
the
steps
,
in
order
that
they
might
neither
*NL*
be
seen
nor
heard
from
the
street
,
and
there
they
sat
,
frequently
*NL*
contenting
themselves
,
by
way
of
conversation
,
with
pressing
each
*NL*
other
's
hands
twenty
times
a
minute
as
they
gazed
at
the
branches
of
the
*NL*
trees
.
At
such
times
,
a
thunderbolt
might
have
fallen
thirty
paces
from
*NL*
them
,
and
they
would
not
have
noticed
it
,
so
deeply
was
the
revery
of
*NL*
the
one
absorbed
and
sunk
in
the
revery
of
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Limpid
purity
.
Hours
wholly
white
;
almost
all
alike
.
This
sort
of
love
*NL*
is
a
recollection
of
lily
petals
and
the
plumage
of
the
dove
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
extent
of
the
garden
lay
between
them
and
the
street
.
Every
*NL*
time
that
Marius
entered
and
left
,
he
carefully
adjusted
the
bar
of
the
*NL*
gate
in
such
a
manner
that
no
displacement
was
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
usually
went
away
about
midnight
,
and
returned
to
Courfeyrac
's
*NL*
lodgings
.
Courfeyrac
said
to
Bahorel
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
believe
it
?
Marius
comes
home
nowadays
at
one
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
expect
?
There
's
always
a
petard
in
a
seminary
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
,
Courfeyrac
folded
his
arms
,
assumed
a
serious
air
,
and
said
to
*NL*
Marius
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
getting
irregular
in
your
habits
,
young
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
being
a
practical
man
,
did
not
take
in
good
part
this
*NL*
reflection
of
an
invisible
paradise
upon
Marius
;
he
was
not
much
in
the
*NL*
habit
of
concealed
passions
;
it
made
him
impatient
,
and
now
and
then
he
*NL*
called
upon
Marius
to
come
back
to
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
he
threw
him
this
admonition
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
fellow
,
you
produce
upon
me
the
effect
of
being
located
in
*NL*
the
moon
,
the
realm
of
dreams
,
the
province
of
illusions
,
capital
,
*NL*
soap-bubble
.
Come
,
be
a
good
boy
,
what
's
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
nothing
could
induce
Marius
``
to
talk
.
''
They
might
have
torn
out
his
*NL*
nails
before
one
of
the
two
sacred
syllables
of
which
that
ineffable
*NL*
name
,
Cosette
,
was
composed
.
True
love
is
as
luminous
as
the
dawn
and
as
*NL*
silent
as
the
tomb
.
Only
,
Courfeyrac
saw
this
change
in
Marius
,
that
his
*NL*
taciturnity
was
of
the
beaming
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
sweet
month
of
May
,
Marius
and
Cosette
learned
to
know
these
*NL*
immense
delights
.
To
dispute
and
to
say
you
for
thou
,
simply
that
they
*NL*
might
say
thou
the
better
afterwards
.
To
talk
at
great
length
with
very
*NL*
minute
details
,
of
persons
in
whom
they
took
not
the
slightest
interest
*NL*
in
the
world
;
another
proof
that
in
that
ravishing
opera
called
love
,
*NL*
the
libretto
counts
for
almost
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Marius
,
to
listen
to
Cosette
discussing
finery
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Cosette
,
to
listen
to
Marius
talk
in
politics
;
*NL*
*NL*
To
listen
,
knee
pressed
to
knee
,
to
the
carriages
rolling
along
the
Rue
*NL*
de
Babylone
;
*NL*
*NL*
To
gaze
upon
the
same
planet
in
space
,
or
at
the
same
glowworm
gleaming
*NL*
in
the
grass
;
*NL*
*NL*
To
hold
their
peace
together
;
a
still
greater
delight
than
conversation
;
*NL*
*NL*
Etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
divers
complications
were
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
Marius
was
on
his
way
to
the
rendezvous
,
by
way
of
the
*NL*
Boulevard
des
Invalides
.
He
habitually
walked
with
drooping
head
.
As
he
*NL*
was
on
the
point
of
turning
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Plumet
,
he
heard
some
*NL*
one
quite
close
to
him
say
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Monsieur
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
head
and
recognized
Eponine
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
produced
a
singular
effect
upon
him
.
He
had
not
thought
of
that
*NL*
girl
a
single
time
since
the
day
when
she
had
conducted
him
to
the
Rue
*NL*
Plumet
,
he
had
not
seen
her
again
,
and
she
had
gone
completely
out
of
*NL*
his
mind
.
He
had
no
reasons
for
anything
but
gratitude
towards
her
,
he
*NL*
owed
her
his
happiness
,
and
yet
,
it
was
embarrassing
to
him
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
an
error
to
think
that
passion
,
when
it
is
pure
and
happy
,
leads
*NL*
man
to
a
state
of
perfection
;
it
simply
leads
him
,
as
we
have
noted
,
to
*NL*
a
state
of
oblivion
.
In
this
situation
,
man
forgets
to
be
bad
,
but
*NL*
he
also
forgets
to
be
good
.
Gratitude
,
duty
,
matters
essential
and
*NL*
important
to
be
remembered
,
vanish
.
At
any
other
time
,
Marius
would
have
*NL*
behaved
quite
differently
to
Eponine
.
Absorbed
in
Cosette
,
he
had
not
*NL*
even
clearly
put
it
to
himself
that
this
Eponine
was
named
Eponine
*NL*
Thenardier
,
and
that
she
bore
the
name
inscribed
in
his
father
's
will
,
*NL*
that
name
,
for
which
,
but
a
few
months
before
,
he
would
have
so
ardently
*NL*
sacrificed
himself
.
We
show
Marius
as
he
was
.
His
father
himself
was
*NL*
fading
out
of
his
soul
to
some
extent
,
under
the
splendor
of
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
with
some
embarrassment
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
so
it
's
you
,
Eponine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
call
me
you
?
Have
I
done
anything
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
he
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
he
had
nothing
against
her
.
Far
from
it
.
Only
,
he
felt
that
*NL*
he
could
not
do
otherwise
,
now
that
he
used
thou
to
Cosette
,
than
say
*NL*
you
to
Eponine
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
remained
silent
,
she
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
paused
.
It
seemed
as
though
words
failed
that
creature
formerly
*NL*
so
heedless
and
so
bold
.
She
tried
to
smile
and
could
not
.
Then
she
*NL*
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
paused
again
,
and
remained
with
downcast
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Marius
,
''
said
she
suddenly
and
abruptly
;
and
away
she
*NL*
went
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
A
CAB
RUNS
IN
ENGLISH
AND
BARKS
IN
SLANG
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
day
was
the
3d
of
June
,
1832
,
a
date
which
it
is
necessary
*NL*
to
indicate
on
account
of
the
grave
events
which
at
that
epoch
hung
on
*NL*
the
horizon
of
Paris
in
the
state
of
lightning-charged
clouds
.
Marius
,
*NL*
at
nightfall
,
was
pursuing
the
same
road
as
on
the
preceding
evening
,
*NL*
with
the
same
thoughts
of
delight
in
his
heart
,
when
he
caught
sight
*NL*
of
Eponine
approaching
,
through
the
trees
of
the
boulevard
.
Two
days
*NL*
in
succession
--
this
was
too
much
.
He
turned
hastily
aside
,
quitted
the
*NL*
boulevard
,
changed
his
course
and
went
to
the
Rue
Plumet
through
the
Rue
*NL*
Monsieur
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
caused
Eponine
to
follow
him
to
the
Rue
Plumet
,
a
thing
which
*NL*
she
had
not
yet
done
.
Up
to
that
time
,
she
had
contented
herself
with
*NL*
watching
him
on
his
passage
along
the
boulevard
without
ever
seeking
to
*NL*
encounter
him
.
It
was
only
on
the
evening
before
that
she
had
attempted
*NL*
to
address
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Eponine
followed
him
,
without
his
suspecting
the
fact
.
She
saw
him
*NL*
displace
the
bar
and
slip
into
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
approached
the
railing
,
felt
of
the
bars
one
after
the
other
,
and
*NL*
readily
recognized
the
one
which
Marius
had
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
in
a
low
voice
and
in
gloomy
accents
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
that
,
Lisette
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
seated
herself
on
the
underpinning
of
the
railing
,
close
beside
the
*NL*
bar
,
as
though
she
were
guarding
it
.
It
was
precisely
at
the
point
where
*NL*
the
railing
touched
the
neighboring
wall
.
There
was
a
dim
nook
there
,
in
*NL*
which
Eponine
was
entirely
concealed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
thus
for
more
than
an
hour
,
without
stirring
and
without
*NL*
breathing
,
a
prey
to
her
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towards
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
one
of
the
two
or
three
persons
who
*NL*
passed
through
the
Rue
Plumet
,
an
old
,
belated
bourgeois
who
was
making
*NL*
haste
to
escape
from
this
deserted
spot
of
evil
repute
,
as
he
skirted
*NL*
the
garden
railings
and
reached
the
angle
which
it
made
with
the
wall
,
*NL*
heard
a
dull
and
threatening
voice
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
no
longer
surprised
that
he
comes
here
every
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
passer-by
cast
a
glance
around
him
,
saw
no
one
,
dared
not
peer
into
*NL*
the
black
niche
,
and
was
greatly
alarmed
.
He
redoubled
his
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
passer-by
had
reason
to
make
haste
,
for
a
very
few
instants
later
,
*NL*
six
men
,
who
were
marching
separately
and
at
some
distance
from
each
*NL*
other
,
along
the
wall
,
and
who
might
have
been
taken
for
a
gray
patrol
,
*NL*
entered
the
Rue
Plumet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
to
arrive
at
the
garden
railing
halted
,
and
waited
for
the
*NL*
others
;
a
second
later
,
all
six
were
reunited
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
men
began
to
talk
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
place
,
''
said
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
a
cab
-LSB-
dog
-RSB-
in
the
garden
?
''
asked
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
In
any
case
,
I
have
fetched
a
ball
that
we
'll
make
him
*NL*
eat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
some
putty
to
break
the
pane
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
railing
is
old
,
''
interpolated
a
fifth
,
who
had
the
voice
of
a
*NL*
ventriloquist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
the
better
,
''
said
the
second
who
had
spoken
.
``
It
wo
n't
screech
*NL*
under
the
saw
,
and
it
wo
n't
be
hard
to
cut
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sixth
,
who
had
not
yet
opened
his
lips
,
now
began
to
inspect
*NL*
the
gate
,
as
Eponine
had
done
an
hour
earlier
,
grasping
each
bar
in
*NL*
succession
,
and
shaking
them
cautiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
came
to
the
bar
which
Marius
had
loosened
.
As
he
was
on
the
*NL*
point
of
grasping
this
bar
,
a
hand
emerged
abruptly
from
the
darkness
,
*NL*
fell
upon
his
arm
;
he
felt
himself
vigorously
thrust
aside
by
a
push
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
his
breast
,
and
a
hoarse
voice
said
to
him
,
but
not
*NL*
loudly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
dog
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
he
perceived
a
pale
girl
standing
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
underwent
that
shock
which
the
unexpected
always
brings
.
He
*NL*
bristled
up
in
hideous
wise
;
nothing
is
so
formidable
to
behold
as
*NL*
ferocious
beasts
who
are
uneasy
;
their
terrified
air
evokes
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recoiled
and
stammered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
jade
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
in
fact
,
Eponine
,
who
had
addressed
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
apparition
of
Eponine
,
the
other
five
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
Claquesous
,
Guelemer
,
Babet
,
Brujon
,
and
Montparnasse
had
noiselessly
*NL*
drawn
near
,
without
precipitation
,
without
uttering
a
word
,
with
the
*NL*
sinister
slowness
peculiar
to
these
men
of
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
indescribable
but
hideous
tools
were
visible
in
their
hands
.
*NL*
Guelemer
held
one
of
those
pairs
of
curved
pincers
which
prowlers
call
*NL*
fanchons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
see
here
,
what
are
you
about
there
?
What
do
you
want
with
us
?
Are
*NL*
you
crazy
?
''
exclaimed
Thenardier
,
as
loudly
as
one
can
exclaim
and
still
*NL*
speak
low
;
``
what
have
you
come
here
to
hinder
our
work
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
burst
out
laughing
,
and
threw
herself
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
here
,
little
father
,
because
I
am
here
.
Is
n't
a
person
allowed
to
*NL*
sit
on
the
stones
nowadays
?
It
's
you
who
ought
not
to
be
here
.
What
*NL*
have
you
come
here
for
,
since
it
's
a
biscuit
?
I
told
Magnon
so
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
to
be
done
here
.
But
embrace
me
,
my
good
little
father
!
It
's
a
*NL*
long
time
since
I
've
seen
you
!
So
you
're
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
tried
to
disentangle
himself
from
Eponine
's
arms
,
and
*NL*
grumbled
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
.
You
've
embraced
me
.
Yes
,
I
'm
out
.
I
'm
not
in
.
Now
,
get
*NL*
away
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Eponine
did
not
release
her
hold
,
and
redoubled
her
caresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
did
you
manage
it

pa

You
must
have

Where

Tell

*NL*
Thenardier
replied
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Eponine
like
a
spoiled

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
caught
her
father
round
the
neck
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

is
stupid

said
Babet

*NL*
*NL*
``
Make

said
Guelemer
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
ventriloquist
's
voice
repeated
his
distich
:

turned
to

*NL*
*NL*
``

It

*NL*

You

Babet

*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
caught
Montparnasse

hand

*NL*

Eponine
very
gently

this

*NL*
*NL*
It
is
remarkable
that
Eponine
did
not
talk
slang
.
That
frightful
tongue
*NL*
had
become
impossible
to
her
since
she
had
known
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pressed
in
her
hand
,
small
,
bony
,
and
feeble
as
that
of
a
skeleton
,
*NL*
Guelemer
's
huge
,
coarse
fingers
,

continued
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*

No

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

ejaculated
Babet
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pointed
out
to
Eponine
,
across
the
tops
of
the
trees
,
a
light
*NL*
which
was
wandering
about
in
the
mansard
roof
of
the
pavilion
.
It
was
*NL*
Toussaint
,
who
had
stayed
up
to
spread
out
some
linen
to
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
made
a
final
effort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
she
,
``
they

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

cried
Thenardier

When

turned

down

,
we
'll
tell
*NL*
you
what

whether
it

half-farthings

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
pushed
her
aside
with
the
intention
of
entering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

Take

Montparnasse

*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
resumed
in
his
decided
tone
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Decamp

*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
released
Montparnasse
's
hand
,
which
she
had
grasped
again
,
and
*NL*
said
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
mean
to
enter

*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather

grinned
the
ventriloquist
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
set
her
back
against
the
gate
,
faced
the
six
ruffians
who
were
*NL*
armed
to
the
teeth
,
and
to
whom
the
night
lent
the
visages
of
demons
,
*NL*
and
said
in
a
firm
,
low
voice
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
do
n't
mean
that
you

*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
in
amazement

The
ventriloquist
,
however
,
finished
his
grin
.
*NL*
She
went
on
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
!
Listen
well

Now

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'd
do
it

too

''
said
Thenardier
in
a
low
tone
to
Brujon
and
the
*NL*
ventriloquist
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
and
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beginning
with
my
father

*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
stepped
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
close

said
she

*NL*
*NL*
He
retreated

growling
between
his
teeth
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

what
's
the
matter
with
her

*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bitch
!

*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
laugh
in
a
terrible
way
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
like

you
shall
not

I

not

There
are
six

matters

You

Well

*NL*
*NL*
She
advanced
a
pace
nearer
the
ruffians
,
she
was
terrible
,
she
burst
out
*NL*
laughing
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardine

not

to

scare

What

Scare

Oh

yes

much

Because
you
have
*NL*
finical
poppets

*NL*
*NL*
She
fastened
her
intent
gaze
upon
Thenardier
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
even
of
you
,
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
continued
,
as
she
cast
her
blood-shot
,
spectre-like
eyes
upon
*NL*
the
ruffians
in
turn
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
I

picked
up

killed
by

blows

whether

a

nets

the
Isle
of
Swans

*NL*
the
midst
of
rotten
old
corks
and
drowned
dogs

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
forced
to
pause
;
she
was
seized
by
a
dry
cough
,
her
breath
came
*NL*
from
her
weak
and
narrow
chest
like
the
death-rattle
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
to
cry
out

and
people

six

I
represent

*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
made
a
movement
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
approach
!

she
cried

*NL*
*NL*
He
halted
,
and
said
gently
:

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

no

I

*NL*
*NL*
``

Eponine

``

must
live

we
must
eat

*NL*
*NL*
``
Burst

*NL*
*NL*
So
saying
,
she
seated
herself
on
the
underpinning
of
the
fence
and
*NL*
hummed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mon

*NL*
Et

''
And
time
wasted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
set
her
elbow
on
her
knee
and
her
chin
in
her
hand
,
and
she
*NL*
swung
her
foot
with
an
air
of
indifference
.
Her
tattered
gown
permitted
*NL*
a
view
of
her
thin
shoulder-blades
.
The
neighboring
street
lantern
*NL*
illuminated
her
profile
and
her
attitude
.
Nothing
more
resolute
and
more
*NL*
surprising
could
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
six
rascals
,
speechless
and
gloomy
at
being
held
in
check
by
a
girl
,
*NL*
retreated
beneath
the
shadow
cast
by
the
lantern
,
and
held
counsel
with
*NL*
furious
and
humiliated
shrugs
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
she
stared
at
them
with
a
stern
but
peaceful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
something
the
matter
with
her
,
''
said
Babet
.
``
A
reason

Is
she

It
's
a

anyway

Two
women

an
*NL*
old
fellow

lodges
in
the
back-yard

and
curtains

*NL*
at

The

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

go
in
,
then
,
the
rest
of
you

''
exclaimed
Montparnasse
.
``
Do
the

job

I
'll
stay
here
with
the
girl

and

she
fails
us

*NL*
*NL*
He
flashed
the
knife
,
which
he
held
open
in
his
hand
,
in
the
light
of
*NL*
the
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
said
not
a
word
,
and
seemed
ready
for
whatever
the
rest
*NL*
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Brujon
,
who
was
somewhat
of
an
oracle
,
and
who
had
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
*NL*
``
put
up
the
job
,
''
had
not
as
yet
spoken
.
He
seemed
thoughtful
.
He
had
*NL*
the
reputation
of
not
sticking
at
anything
,
and
it
was
known
that
he
*NL*
had
plundered
a
police
post
simply
out
of
bravado
.
Besides
this
he
made
*NL*
verses
and
songs
,
which
gave
him
great
authority
.
*NL*
*NL*
Babet
interrogated
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
say
nothing
,
Brujon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Brujon
remained
silent
an
instant
longer
,
then
he
shook
his
head
in
*NL*
various
ways
,
and
finally
concluded
to
speak
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
;
this
morning
I
came
across
two
sparrows
fighting
,
this
*NL*
evening
I
jostled
a

was
quarrelling
.
All
that
's
bad
.
Let
's
*NL*
quit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
,
Montparnasse
muttered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
!
if
they
had
wanted
,
I
'd
have
cut
her
throat

''
*NL*
*NL*
Babet
responded
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
.
I
do
n't
hit
a
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
corner
of
the
street
they
halted
and
exchanged
the
following
*NL*
enigmatical
dialogue
in
a
low
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
shall
we
go
to
sleep
to-night
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardi

''
*NL*
*NL*
Eponine
,
who
never
took
her
eyes
off
of
them
,
saw
them
retreat
by
the
*NL*
road
by
which
they
had
come
.
She
rose
and
began
to
creep
after
them
*NL*
along
the
walls
and
the
houses
.
She
followed
them
thus
as
far
as
the
*NL*
boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
they
parted
,
and
she
saw
these
six
men
plunge
into
the
gloom
,
*NL*
where
they
appeared
to
melt
away
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THINGS
OF
THE
NIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
departure
of
the
ruffians
,
the
Rue
Plumet
resumed
its
*NL*
tranquil
,
nocturnal
aspect
.
That
which
had
just
taken
place
in
this
*NL*
street
would
not
have
astonished
a
forest
.
The
lofty
trees
,
the
copses
,
*NL*
the
heaths
,
the
branches
rudely
interlaced
,
the
tall
grass
,
exist
in
*NL*
a
sombre
manner
;
the
savage
swarming
there
catches
glimpses
of
sudden
*NL*
apparitions
of
the
invisible
;
that
which
is
below
man
distinguishes
,
*NL*
through
the
mists
,
that
which
is
beyond
man
;
and
the
things
of
which
we
*NL*
living
beings
are
ignorant
there
meet
face
to
face
in
the
night
.
Nature
,
*NL*
bristling
and
wild
,
takes
alarm
at
certain
approaches
in
which
she
*NL*
fancies
that
she
feels
the
supernatural
.
The
forces
of
the
gloom
know
*NL*
each
other
,
and
are
strangely
balanced
by
each
other
.
Teeth
and
claws
*NL*
fear
what
they
can
not
grasp
.
Blood-drinking
bestiality
,
voracious
*NL*
appetites
,
hunger
in
search
of
prey
,
the
armed
instincts
of
nails
*NL*
and
jaws
which
have
for
source
and
aim
the
belly
,
glare
and
smell
out
*NL*
uneasily
the
impassive
spectral
forms
straying
beneath
a
shroud
,
erect
*NL*
in
its
vague
and
shuddering
robe
,
and
which
seem
to
them
to
live
with
*NL*
a
dead
and
terrible
life
.
These
brutalities
,
which
are
only
matter
,
*NL*
entertain
a
confused
fear
of
having
to
deal
with
the
immense
obscurity
*NL*
condensed
into
an
unknown
being
.
A
black
figure
barring
the
way
stops
*NL*
the
wild
beast
short
.
That
which
emerges
from
the
cemetery
intimidates
*NL*
and
disconcerts
that
which
emerges
from
the
cave
;
the
ferocious
fear
the
*NL*
sinister
;
wolves
recoil
when
they
encounter
a
ghoul
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
MARIUS
BECOMES
PRACTICAL
ONCE
MORE
TO
THE
EXTENT
OF
GIVING
*NL*
COSETTE
HIS
ADDRESS
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
sort
of
a
dog
with
a
human
face
was
mounting
guard
over
the
*NL*
gate
,
and
while
the
six
ruffians
were
yielding
to
a
girl
,
Marius
was
by
*NL*
Cosette
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
the
sky
been
more
studded
with
stars
and
more
charming
,
the
*NL*
trees
more
trembling
,
the
odor
of
the
grass
more
penetrating
;
never
had
*NL*
the
birds
fallen
asleep
among
the
leaves
with
a
sweeter
noise
;
never
had
*NL*
all
the
harmonies
of
universal
serenity
responded
more
thoroughly
to
the
*NL*
inward
music
of
love
;
never
had
Marius
been
more
captivated
,
more
happy
,
*NL*
more
ecstatic
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
had
found
Cosette
sad
;
Cosette
had
been
weeping
.
Her
eyes
were
*NL*
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
first
cloud
in
that
wonderful
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
first
word
had
been
:
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
had
replied
:
``
This
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
had
seated
herself
on
the
bench
near
the
steps
,
and
while
he
*NL*
tremblingly
took
his
place
beside
her
,
she
had
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
told
me
this
morning
to
hold
myself
in
readiness
,
because
he
*NL*
has
business
,
and
we
may
go
away
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
shivered
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
one
is
at
the
end
of
one
's
life
,
to
die
means
to
go
away
;
when
one
*NL*
is
at
the
beginning
of
it
,
to
go
away
means
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
last
six
weeks
,
Marius
had
little
by
little
,
slowly
,
by
degrees
,
*NL*
taken
possession
of
Cosette
each
day
.
As
we
have
already
explained
,
in
*NL*
the
case
of
first
love
,
the
soul
is
taken
long
before
the
body
;
later
*NL*
on
,
one
takes
the
body
long
before
the
soul
;
sometimes
one
does
not
take
*NL*
the
soul
at
all
;
the
Faublas
and
the
Prudhommes
add
:
``
Because
there
is
*NL*
none
''
;
but
the
sarcasm
is
,
fortunately
,
a
blasphemy
.
So
Marius
possessed
*NL*
Cosette
,
as
spirits
possess
,
but
he
enveloped
her
with
all
his
soul
,
and
*NL*
seized
her
jealously
with
incredible
conviction
.
He
possessed
her
smile
,
*NL*
her
breath
,
her
perfume
,
the
profound
radiance
of
her
blue
eyes
,
the
*NL*
sweetness
of
her
skin
when
he
touched
her
hand
,
the
charming
mark
which
*NL*
she
had
on
her
neck
,
all
her
thoughts
.
Therefore
,
he
possessed
all
*NL*
Cosette
's
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
incessantly
gazed
at
,
and
he
sometimes
touched
lightly
with
his
*NL*
breath
,
the
short
locks
on
the
nape
of
her
neck
,
and
he
declared
to
*NL*
himself
that
there
was
not
one
of
those
short
hairs
which
did
not
belong
*NL*
to
him
,
Marius
.
He
gazed
upon
and
adored
the
things
that
she
wore
,
her
*NL*
knot
of
ribbon
,
her
gloves
,
her
sleeves
,
her
shoes
,
her
cuffs
,
as
sacred
*NL*
objects
of
which
he
was
the
master
.
He
dreamed
that
he
was
the
lord
of
*NL*
those
pretty
shell
combs
which
she
wore
in
her
hair
,
and
he
even
said
to
*NL*
himself
,
in
confused
and
suppressed
stammerings
of
voluptuousness
which
*NL*
did
not
make
their
way
to
the
light
,
that
there
was
not
a
ribbon
of
her
*NL*
gown
,
not
a
mesh
in
her
stockings
,
not
a
fold
in
her
bodice
,
which
was
*NL*
not
his
.
Beside
Cosette
he
felt
himself
beside
his
own
property
,
his
*NL*
own
thing
,
his
own
despot
and
his
slave
.
It
seemed
as
though
they
had
*NL*
so
intermingled
their
souls
,
that
it
would
have
been
impossible
to
tell
*NL*
them
apart
had
they
wished
to
take
them
back
again
.
--
``
This
is
mine
.
''
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
mine
.
''
``
I
assure
you
that
you
are
mistaken
.
This
is
my
*NL*
property
.
''
``
What
you
are
taking
as
your
own
is
myself
.
''
--
Marius
was
*NL*
something
that
made
a
part
of
Cosette
,
and
Cosette
was
something
which
*NL*
made
a
part
of
Marius
.
Marius
felt
Cosette
within
him
.
To
have
Cosette
,
*NL*
to
possess
Cosette
,
this
,
to
him
,
was
not
to
be
distinguished
from
*NL*
breathing
.
It
was
in
the
midst
of
this
faith
,
of
this
intoxication
,
of
*NL*
this
virgin
possession
,
unprecedented
and
absolute
,
of
this
sovereignty
,
*NL*
that
these
words
:
``
We
are
going
away
,
''
fell
suddenly
,
at
a
blow
,
and
*NL*
that
the
harsh
voice
of
reality
cried
to
him
:
``
Cosette
is
not
yours
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
awoke
.
For
six
weeks
Marius
had
been
living
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
outside
of
life
;
those
words
,
going
away
!
caused
him
to
re-enter
it
*NL*
harshly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
not
a
word
to
say
.
Cosette
merely
felt
that
his
hand
was
very
*NL*
cold
.
She
said
to
him
in
her
turn
:
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
replied
in
so
low
a
tone
that
Cosette
hardly
heard
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
understand
what
you
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
morning
my
father
told
me
to
settle
all
my
little
affairs
and
to
*NL*
hold
myself
in
readiness
,
that
he
would
give
me
his
linen
to
put
in
a
*NL*
trunk
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
go
on
a
journey
,
that
we
were
to
go
away
,
*NL*
that
it
is
necessary
to
have
a
large
trunk
for
me
and
a
small
one
for
*NL*
him
,
and
that
all
is
to
be
ready
in
a
week
from
now
,
and
that
we
might
*NL*
go
to
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
outrageous
!
''
exclaimed
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
,
that
,
at
that
moment
,
no
abuse
of
power
,
no
violence
,
not
*NL*
one
of
the
abominations
of
the
worst
tyrants
,
no
action
of
Busiris
,
of
*NL*
Tiberius
,
or
of
Henry
VIII.
,
could
have
equalled
this
in
atrocity
,
*NL*
in
the
opinion
of
Marius
;
M.
Fauchelevent
taking
his
daughter
off
to
*NL*
England
because
he
had
business
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
demanded
in
a
weak
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
do
you
start
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
say
when
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
shall
you
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
say
when
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
rose
and
said
coldly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
,
shall
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
turned
toward
him
her
beautiful
eyes
,
all
filled
with
anguish
,
*NL*
and
replied
in
a
sort
of
bewilderment
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
England
.
Shall
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
say
you
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
whether
you
will
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
expect
me
to
do
?
''
she
said
,
clasping
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
you
will
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
my
father
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
,
you
will
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
took
Marius
'
hand
,
and
pressed
it
without
replying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
then
I
will
go
elsewhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
felt
rather
than
understood
the
meaning
of
these
words
.
*NL*
She
turned
so
pale
that
her
face
shone
white
through
the
gloom
.
She
*NL*
stammered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
looked
at
her
,
then
raised
his
eyes
to
heaven
,
and
answered
:
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
his
eyes
fell
again
,
he
saw
Cosette
smiling
at
him
.
The
smile
of
a
*NL*
woman
whom
one
loves
possesses
a
visible
radiance
,
even
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
silly
we
are
!
Marius
,
I
have
an
idea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
go
away
,
do
you
go
too
!
I
will
tell
you
where
!
Come
and
join
me
*NL*
wherever
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
now
a
thoroughly
roused
man
.
He
had
fallen
back
into
reality
.
*NL*
He
cried
to
Cosette
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
away
with
you
!
Are
you
mad
?
Why
,
I
should
have
to
have
money
,
and
I
*NL*
have
none
!
Go
to
England
?
But
I
am
in
debt
now
,
I
owe
,
I
do
n't
know
how
*NL*
much
,
more
than
ten
louis
to
Courfeyrac
,
one
of
my
friends
with
whom
you
*NL*
are
not
acquainted
!
I
have
an
old
hat
which
is
not
worth
three
francs
,
*NL*
I
have
a
coat
which
lacks
buttons
in
front
,
my
shirt
is
all
ragged
,
my
*NL*
elbows
are
torn
,
my
boots
let
in
the
water
;
for
the
last
six
weeks
I
*NL*
have
not
thought
about
it
,
and
I
have
not
told
you
about
it
.
You
only
*NL*
see
me
at
night
,
and
you
give
me
your
love
;
if
you
were
to
see
me
in
the
*NL*
daytime
,
you
would
give
me
a
sou
!
Go
to
England
!
Eh
!
I
have
n't
enough
to
*NL*
pay
for
a
passport
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
himself
against
a
tree
which
was
close
at
hand
,
erect
,
his
brow
*NL*
pressed
close
to
the
bark
,
feeling
neither
the
wood
which
flayed
his
*NL*
skin
,
nor
the
fever
which
was
throbbing
in
his
temples
,
and
there
he
*NL*
stood
motionless
,
on
the
point
of
falling
,
like
the
statue
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
a
long
time
thus
.
One
could
remain
for
eternity
in
such
*NL*
abysses
.
At
last
he
turned
round
.
He
heard
behind
him
a
faint
stifled
*NL*
noise
,
which
was
sweet
yet
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Cosette
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
weeping
for
more
than
two
hours
beside
Marius
as
he
*NL*
meditated
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
her
,
fell
at
her
knees
,
and
slowly
prostrating
himself
,
he
*NL*
took
the
tip
of
her
foot
which
peeped
out
from
beneath
her
robe
,
and
*NL*
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
let
him
have
his
way
in
silence
.
There
are
moments
when
a
woman
*NL*
accepts
,
like
a
sombre
and
resigned
goddess
,
the
religion
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
weep
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
when
I
may
be
going
away
,
and
you
can
not
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
replied
,
sobbing
,
by
that
word
from
paradise
which
is
never
more
*NL*
charming
than
amid
tears
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
adore
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
in
a
tone
which
was
an
indescribable
caress
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
weep
.
Tell
me
,
will
you
do
this
for
me
,
and
cease
to
weep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
love
me
?
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
,
I
have
never
given
my
word
of
honor
to
any
one
,
because
my
*NL*
word
of
honor
terrifies
me
.
I
feel
that
my
father
is
by
my
side
.
Well
,
I
*NL*
give
you
my
most
sacred
word
of
honor
,
that
if
you
go
away
I
shall
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
tone
with
which
he
uttered
these
words
there
lay
a
melancholy
so
*NL*
solemn
and
so
tranquil
,
that
Cosette
trembled
.
She
felt
that
chill
which
*NL*
is
produced
by
a
true
and
gloomy
thing
as
it
passes
by
.
The
shock
made
*NL*
her
cease
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
listen
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
not
expect
me
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
expect
me
until
the
day
after
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
day
without
seeing
you
!
But
that
is
impossible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
sacrifice
one
day
in
order
to
gain
our
whole
lives
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Marius
added
in
a
low
tone
and
in
an
aside
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
who
never
changes
his
habits
,
and
he
has
never
received
any
*NL*
one
except
in
the
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
man
are
you
speaking
?
''
asked
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
I
said
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
hope
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
until
the
day
after
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wish
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Cosette
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
his
head
in
both
her
hands
,
raising
herself
on
tiptoe
in
order
*NL*
to
be
on
a
level
with
him
,
and
tried
to
read
his
hope
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
resumed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
I
think
of
it
,
you
ought
to
know
my
address
:
something
might
*NL*
happen
,
one
never
knows
;
I
live
with
that
friend
named
Courfeyrac
,
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Verrerie
,
No.
16
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
searched
in
his
pocket
,
pulled
out
his
penknife
,
and
with
the
blade
*NL*
he
wrote
on
the
plaster
of
the
wall
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
16
Rue
de
la
Verrerie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Cosette
had
begun
to
gaze
into
his
eyes
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
your
thought
,
Marius
;
you
have
some
idea
.
Tell
it
to
me
.
Oh
!
*NL*
tell
me
,
so
that
I
may
pass
a
pleasant
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
my
idea
:
that
it
is
impossible
that
God
should
mean
to
part
us
.
*NL*
Wait
;
expect
me
the
day
after
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
do
until
then
?
''
said
Cosette
.
``
You
are
outside
,
you
go
,
*NL*
and
come
!
How
happy
men
are
!
I
shall
remain
entirely
alone
!
Oh
!
How
sad
*NL*
I
shall
be
!
What
is
it
that
you
are
going
to
do
to-morrow
evening
?
tell
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
try
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
will
pray
to
God
and
I
will
think
of
you
here
,
so
that
you
may
*NL*
be
successful
.
I
will
question
you
no
further
,
since
you
do
not
wish
it
.
*NL*
You
are
my
master
.
I
shall
pass
the
evening
to-morrow
in
singing
that
*NL*
music
from
Euryanthe
that
you
love
,
and
that
you
came
one
evening
to
*NL*
listen
to
,
outside
my
shutters
.
But
day
after
to-morrow
you
will
come
*NL*
early
.
I
shall
expect
you
at
dusk
,
at
nine
o'clock
precisely
,
I
warn
*NL*
you
.
Mon
Dieu
!
how
sad
it
is
that
the
days
are
so
long
!
On
the
stroke
of
*NL*
nine
,
do
you
understand
,
I
shall
be
in
the
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
having
uttered
it
,
moved
by
the
same
thought
,
impelled
by
*NL*
those
electric
currents
which
place
lovers
in
continual
communication
,
*NL*
both
being
intoxicated
with
delight
even
in
their
sorrow
,
they
fell
into
*NL*
each
other
's
arms
,
without
perceiving
that
their
lips
met
while
their
*NL*
uplifted
eyes
,
overflowing
with
rapture
and
full
of
tears
,
gazed
upon
*NL*
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marius
went
forth
,
the
street
was
deserted
.
This
was
the
moment
*NL*
when
Eponine
was
following
the
ruffians
to
the
boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Marius
had
been
dreaming
with
his
head
pressed
to
the
tree
,
an
*NL*
idea
had
crossed
his
mind
;
an
idea
,
alas
!
that
he
himself
judged
to
be
*NL*
senseless
and
impossible
.
He
had
come
to
a
desperate
decision

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
OLD
HEART
AND
THE
YOUNG
HEART
IN
THE
PRESENCE
OF
EACH
*NL*
OTHER
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
Father
Gillenormand
was
well
past
his
ninety-first
*NL*
birthday
.
He
still
lived
with
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
in
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
No.
6
,
in
the
old
house
which
he
owned
.
He
was
,
as
*NL*
the
reader
will
remember
,
one
of
those
antique
old
men
who
await
death
*NL*
perfectly
erect
,
whom
age
bears
down
without
bending
,
and
whom
even
*NL*
sorrow
can
not
curve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
his
daughter
had
been
saying
for
some
time
:
``
My
father
is
*NL*
sinking
.
''
He
no
longer
boxed
the
maids
'
ears
;
he
no
longer
thumped
*NL*
the
landing-place
so
vigorously
with
his
cane
when
Basque
was
slow
in
*NL*
opening
the
door
.
The
Revolution
of
July
had
exasperated
him
for
the
*NL*
space
of
barely
six
months
.
He
had
viewed
,
almost
tranquilly
,
that
*NL*
coupling
of
words
,
in
the
Moniteur
:
M.
Humblot-Conte
,
peer
of
France
.
*NL*
The
fact
is
,
that
the
old
man
was
deeply
dejected
.
He
did
not
bend
,
he
*NL*
did
not
yield
;
this
was
no
more
a
characteristic
of
his
physical
than
*NL*
of
his
moral
nature
,
but
he
felt
himself
giving
way
internally
.
For
four
*NL*
years
he
had
been
waiting
for
Marius
,
with
his
foot
firmly
planted
,
that
*NL*
is
the
exact
word
,
in
the
conviction
that
that
good-for-nothing
young
*NL*
scamp
would
ring
at
his
door
some
day
or
other
;
now
he
had
reached
*NL*
the
point
,
where
,
at
certain
gloomy
hours
,
he
said
to
himself
,
that
*NL*
if
Marius
made
him
wait
much
longer
--
It
was
not
death
that
was
*NL*
insupportable
to
him
;
it
was
the
idea
that
perhaps
he
should
never
see
*NL*
Marius
again
.
The
idea
of
never
seeing
Marius
again
had
never
entered
*NL*
his
brain
until
that
day
;
now
the
thought
began
to
recur
to
him
,
and
*NL*
it
chilled
him
.
Absence
,
as
is
always
the
case
in
genuine
and
natural
*NL*
sentiments
,
had
only
served
to
augment
the
grandfather
's
love
for
the
*NL*
ungrateful
child
,
who
had
gone
off
like
a
flash
.
It
is
during
December
*NL*
nights
,
when
the
cold
stands
at
ten
degrees
,
that
one
thinks
oftenest
of
*NL*
the
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
was
,
or
thought
himself
,
above
all
things
,
incapable
*NL*
of
taking
a
single
step
,
he
--
the
grandfather
,
towards
his
grandson
;
``
I
*NL*
would
die
rather
,
''
he
said
to
himself
.
He
did
not
consider
himself
*NL*
as
the
least
to
blame
;
but
he
thought
of
Marius
only
with
profound
*NL*
tenderness
,
and
the
mute
despair
of
an
elderly
,
kindly
old
man
who
is
*NL*
about
to
vanish
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
lose
his
teeth
,
which
added
to
his
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
,
without
however
acknowledging
it
to
himself
,
for
it
*NL*
would
have
rendered
him
furious
and
ashamed
,
had
never
loved
a
mistress
*NL*
as
he
loved
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
had
placed
in
his
chamber
,
opposite
the
head
of
his
bed
,
so
that
*NL*
it
should
be
the
first
thing
on
which
his
eyes
fell
on
waking
,
an
*NL*
old
portrait
of
his
other
daughter
,
who
was
dead
,
Madame
Pontmercy
,
*NL*
a
portrait
which
had
been
taken
when
she
was
eighteen
.
He
gazed
*NL*
incessantly
at
that
portrait
.
One
day
,
he
happened
to
say
,
as
he
gazed
*NL*
upon
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
the
likeness
is
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
my
sister
?
''
inquired
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
.
``
Yes
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
man
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
him
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
as
he
sat
with
his
knees
pressed
together
,
and
his
eyes
almost
*NL*
closed
,
in
a
despondent
attitude
,
his
daughter
ventured
to
say
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
are
you
as
angry
with
him
as
ever
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
not
daring
to
proceed
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
whom
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
that
poor
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
aged
head
,
laid
his
withered
and
emaciated
fist
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
exclaimed
in
his
most
irritated
and
vibrating
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Marius
,
do
you
say
!
That
gentleman
is
a
knave
,
a
wretched
*NL*
scoundrel
,
a
vain
little
ingrate
,
a
heartless
,
soulless
,
haughty
,
and
*NL*
wicked
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
turned
away
so
that
his
daughter
might
not
see
the
tear
that
*NL*
stood
in
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
he
broke
a
silence
which
had
lasted
four
hours
,
to
say
*NL*
to
his
daughter
point-blank
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
the
honor
to
ask
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
never
to
mention
him
*NL*
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Gillenormand
renounced
every
effort
,
and
pronounced
this
acute
*NL*
diagnosis
:
``
My
father
never
cared
very
much
for
my
sister
after
her
*NL*
folly
.
It
is
clear
that
he
detests
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
her
folly
''
meant
:
``
after
she
had
married
the
colonel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
as
the
reader
has
been
able
to
conjecture
,
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Gillenormand
had
failed
in
her
attempt
to
substitute
her
favorite
,
the
*NL*
officer
of
lancers
,
for
Marius
.
The
substitute
,
Theodule
,
had
not
been
a
*NL*
success
.
M.
Gillenormand
had
not
accepted
the
quid
pro
quo
.
A
vacancy
*NL*
in
the
heart
does
not
accommodate
itself
to
a
stop-gap
.
Theodule
,
on
his
*NL*
side
,
though
he
scented
the
inheritance
,
was
disgusted
at
the
task
*NL*
of
pleasing
.
The
goodman
bored
the
lancer
;
and
the
lancer
shocked
the
*NL*
goodman
.
Lieutenant
Theodule
was
gay
,
no
doubt
,
but
a
chatter-box
,
*NL*
frivolous
,
but
vulgar
;
a
high
liver
,
but
a
frequenter
of
bad
company
;
he
*NL*
had
mistresses
,
it
is
true
,
and
he
had
a
great
deal
to
say
about
them
,
*NL*
it
is
true
also
;
but
he
talked
badly
.
All
his
good
qualities
had
a
*NL*
defect
.
M.
Gillenormand
was
worn
out
with
hearing
him
tell
about
the
*NL*
love
affairs
that
he
had
in
the
vicinity
of
the
barracks
in
the
Rue
*NL*
de
Babylone
.
And
then
,
Lieutenant
Gillenormand
sometimes
came
in
his
*NL*
uniform
,
with
the
tricolored
cockade
.
This
rendered
him
downright
*NL*
intolerable
.
Finally
,
Father
Gillenormand
had
said
to
his
daughter
:
*NL*
``
I
've
had
enough
of
that
Theodule
.
I
have
n't
much
taste
for
warriors
*NL*
in
time
of
peace
.
Receive
him
if
you
choose
.
I
do
n't
know
but
I
prefer
*NL*
slashers
to
fellows
that
drag
their
swords
.
The
clash
of
blades
in
*NL*
battle
is
less
dismal
,
after
all
,
than
the
clank
of
the
scabbard
on
*NL*
the
pavement
.
And
then
,
throwing
out
your
chest
like
a
bully
and
*NL*
lacing
yourself
like
a
girl
,
with
stays
under
your
cuirass
,
is
doubly
*NL*
ridiculous
.
When
one
is
a
veritable
man
,
one
holds
equally
aloof
*NL*
from
swagger
and
from
affected
airs
.
He
is
neither
a
blusterer
nor
a
*NL*
finnicky-hearted
man
.
Keep
your
Theodule
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
vain
that
his
daughter
said
to
him
:
``
But
he
is
your
*NL*
grandnephew
,
nevertheless
,
''
--
it
turned
out
that
M.
Gillenormand
,
who
*NL*
was
a
grandfather
to
the
very
finger-tips
,
was
not
in
the
least
a
*NL*
grand-uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
as
he
had
good
sense
,
and
as
he
had
compared
the
two
,
Theodule
*NL*
had
only
served
to
make
him
regret
Marius
all
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
--
it
was
the
24th
of
June
,
which
did
not
prevent
Father
*NL*
Gillenormand
having
a
rousing
fire
on
the
hearth
,
--
he
had
dismissed
his
*NL*
daughter
,
who
was
sewing
in
a
neighboring
apartment
.
He
was
alone
in
*NL*
his
chamber
,
amid
its
pastoral
scenes
,
with
his
feet
propped
on
the
*NL*
andirons
,
half
enveloped
in
his
huge
screen
of
coromandel
lacquer
,
with
*NL*
its
nine
leaves
,
with
his
elbow
resting
on
a
table
where
burned
two
*NL*
candles
under
a
green
shade
,
engulfed
in
his
tapestry
armchair
,
and
in
*NL*
his
hand
a
book
which
he
was
not
reading
.
He
was
dressed
,
according
*NL*
to
his
wont
,
like
an
incroyable
,
and
resembled
an
antique
portrait
by
*NL*
Garat
.
This
would
have
made
people
run
after
him
in
the
street
,
had
not
*NL*
his
daughter
covered
him
up
,
whenever
he
went
out
,
in
a
vast
bishop
's
*NL*
wadded
cloak
,
which
concealed
his
attire
.
At
home
,
he
never
wore
a
*NL*
dressing
gown
,
except
when
he
rose
and
retired
.
``
It
gives
one
a
look
of
*NL*
age
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
was
thinking
of
Marius
lovingly
and
bitterly
;
and
,
*NL*
as
usual
,
bitterness
predominated
.
His
tenderness
once
soured
always
*NL*
ended
by
boiling
and
turning
to
indignation
.
He
had
reached
the
point
*NL*
where
a
man
tries
to
make
up
his
mind
and
to
accept
that
which
rends
his
*NL*
heart
.
He
was
explaining
to
himself
that
there
was
no
longer
any
reason
*NL*
why
Marius
should
return
,
that
if
he
intended
to
return
,
he
should
*NL*
have
done
it
long
ago
,
that
he
must
renounce
the
idea
.
He
was
trying
to
*NL*
accustom
himself
to
the
thought
that
all
was
over
,
and
that
he
should
*NL*
die
without
having
beheld
``
that
gentleman
''
again
.
But
his
whole
nature
*NL*
revolted
;
his
aged
paternity
would
not
consent
to
this
.
``
Well
!
''
said
*NL*
he
,
--
this
was
his
doleful
refrain
,
--
``
he
will
not
return
!
''
His
bald
head
*NL*
had
fallen
upon
his
breast
,
and
he
fixed
a
melancholy
and
irritated
gaze
*NL*
upon
the
ashes
on
his
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
very
midst
of
his
revery
,
his
old
servant
Basque
entered
,
and
*NL*
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
Monsieur
receive
M.
Marius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
sat
up
erect
,
pallid
,
and
like
a
corpse
which
rises
under
*NL*
the
influence
of
a
galvanic
shock
.
All
his
blood
had
retreated
to
his
*NL*
heart
.
He
stammered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Marius
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
Basque
,
intimidated
and
put
out
of
countenance
*NL*
by
his
master
's
air
;
``
I
have
not
seen
him
.
Nicolette
came
in
and
said
to
*NL*
me
:
`
There
's
a
young
man
here
;
say
that
it
is
M.
Marius
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
stammered
in
a
low
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
him
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
remained
in
the
same
attitude
,
with
shaking
head
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
fixed
on
the
door
.
It
opened
once
more
.
A
young
man
entered
.
It
was
*NL*
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
halted
at
the
door
,
as
though
waiting
to
be
bidden
to
enter
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
almost
squalid
attire
was
not
perceptible
in
the
obscurity
caused
by
*NL*
the
shade
.
Nothing
could
be
seen
but
his
calm
,
grave
,
but
strangely
sad
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
several
minutes
before
Father
Gillenormand
,
dulled
with
amazement
*NL*
and
joy
,
could
see
anything
except
a
brightness
as
when
one
is
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
an
apparition
.
He
was
on
the
point
of
swooning
;
he
saw
*NL*
Marius
through
a
dazzling
light
.
It
certainly
was
he
,
it
certainly
was
*NL*
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
!
After
the
lapse
of
four
years
!
He
grasped
him
entire
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
in
a
single
glance
.
He
found
him
noble
,
handsome
,
distinguished
,
*NL*
well-grown
,
a
complete
man
,
with
a
suitable
mien
and
a
charming
air
.
He
*NL*
felt
a
desire
to
open
his
arms
,
to
call
him
,
to
fling
himself
forward
;
*NL*
his
heart
melted
with
rapture
,
affectionate
words
swelled
and
overflowed
*NL*
his
breast
;
at
length
all
his
tenderness
came
to
the
light
and
reached
*NL*
his
lips
,
and
,
by
a
contrast
which
constituted
the
very
foundation
of
*NL*
his
nature
,
what
came
forth
was
harshness
.
He
said
abruptly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
come
here
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
replied
with
embarrassment
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
would
have
liked
to
have
Marius
throw
himself
into
his
*NL*
arms
.
He
was
displeased
with
Marius
and
with
himself
.
He
was
conscious
*NL*
that
he
was
brusque
,
and
that
Marius
was
cold
.
It
caused
the
goodman
*NL*
unendurable
and
irritating
anxiety
to
feel
so
tender
and
forlorn
*NL*
within
,
and
only
to
be
able
to
be
hard
outside
.
Bitterness
returned
.
He
*NL*
interrupted
Marius
in
a
peevish
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
you
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
``
then
''
signified
:
If
you
do
not
come
to
embrace
me
.
Marius
looked
*NL*
at
his
grandfather
,
whose
pallor
gave
him
a
face
of
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
come
to
beg
my
pardon
?
Do
you
acknowledge
your
faults
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
he
was
putting
Marius
on
the
right
road
,
and
that
``
the
child
''
*NL*
would
yield
.
Marius
shivered
;
it
was
the
denial
of
his
father
that
was
*NL*
required
of
him
;
he
dropped
his
eyes
and
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
exclaimed
the
old
man
impetuously
,
with
a
grief
that
was
*NL*
poignant
and
full
of
wrath
,
``
what
do
you
want
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
clasped
his
hands
,
advanced
a
step
,
and
said
in
a
feeble
and
*NL*
trembling
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
have
pity
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
touched
M.
Gillenormand
;
uttered
a
little
sooner
,
they
would
*NL*
have
rendered
him
tender
,
but
they
came
too
late
.
The
grandfather
rose
;
*NL*
he
supported
himself
with
both
hands
on
his
cane
;
his
lips
were
white
,
*NL*
his
brow
wavered
,
but
his
lofty
form
towered
above
Marius
as
he
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pity
on
you
,
sir
!
It
is
youth
demanding
pity
of
the
old
man
of
*NL*
ninety-one
!
You
are
entering
into
life
,
I
am
leaving
it
;
you
go
to
the
*NL*
play
,
to
balls
,
to
the
cafe
,
to
the
billiard-hall
;
you
have
wit
,
you
*NL*
please
the
women
,
you
are
a
handsome
fellow
;
as
for
me
,
I
spit
on
my
*NL*
brands
in
the
heart
of
summer
;
you
are
rich
with
the
only
riches
that
*NL*
are
really
such
,
I
possess
all
the
poverty
of
age
;
infirmity
,
isolation
!
*NL*
You
have
your
thirty-two
teeth
,
a
good
digestion
,
bright
eyes
,
strength
,
*NL*
appetite
,
health
,
gayety
,
a
forest
of
black
hair
;
I
have
no
longer
even
*NL*
white
hair
,
I
have
lost
my
teeth
,
I
am
losing
my
legs
,
I
am
losing
my
*NL*
memory
;
there
are
three
names
of
streets
that
I
confound
incessantly
,
*NL*
the
Rue
Charlot
,
the
Rue
du
Chaume
,
and
the
Rue
Saint-Claude
,
that
*NL*
is
what
I
have
come
to
;
you
have
before
you
the
whole
future
,
full
of
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
I
am
beginning
to
lose
my
sight
,
so
far
am
I
advancing
*NL*
into
the
night
;
you
are
in
love
,
that
is
a
matter
of
course
,
I
am
*NL*
beloved
by
no
one
in
all
the
world
;
and
you
ask
pity
of
me
!
Parbleu
!
*NL*
Moliere
forgot
that
.
If
that
is
the
way
you
jest
at
the
courthouse
,
*NL*
Messieurs
the
lawyers
,
I
sincerely
compliment
you
.
You
are
droll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
octogenarian
went
on
in
a
grave
and
angry
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
now
,
what
do
you
want
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
I
know
that
my
presence
is
displeasing
to
you
,
but
*NL*
I
have
come
merely
to
ask
one
thing
of
you
,
and
then
I
shall
go
away
*NL*
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
fool
!
''
said
the
old
man
.
``
Who
said
that
you
were
to
go
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
translation
of
the
tender
words
which
lay
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
his
heart
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
my
pardon
!
Throw
yourself
on
my
neck
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
felt
that
Marius
would
leave
him
in
a
few
moments
,
that
*NL*
his
harsh
reception
had
repelled
the
lad
,
that
his
hardness
was
driving
*NL*
him
away
;
he
said
all
this
to
himself
,
and
it
augmented
his
grief
;
and
*NL*
as
his
grief
was
straightway
converted
into
wrath
,
it
increased
his
*NL*
harshness
.
He
would
have
liked
to
have
Marius
understand
,
and
Marius
did
*NL*
not
understand
,
which
made
the
goodman
furious
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
you
deserted
me
,
your
grandfather
,
you
left
my
house
to
go
no
*NL*
one
knows
whither
,
you
drove
your
aunt
to
despair
,
you
went
off
,
it
is
*NL*
easily
guessed
,
to
lead
a
bachelor
life
;
it
's
more
convenient
,
to
play
*NL*
the
dandy
,
to
come
in
at
all
hours
,
to
amuse
yourself
;
you
have
given
me
*NL*
no
signs
of
life
,
you
have
contracted
debts
without
even
telling
me
to
*NL*
pay
them
,
you
have
become
a
smasher
of
windows
and
a
blusterer
,
and
,
at
*NL*
the
end
of
four
years
,
you
come
to
me
,
and
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
*NL*
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
violent
fashion
of
driving
a
grandson
to
tenderness
was
productive
*NL*
only
of
silence
on
the
part
of
Marius
.
M.
Gillenormand
folded
his
arms
;
*NL*
a
gesture
which
with
him
was
peculiarly
imperious
,
and
apostrophized
*NL*
Marius
bitterly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
make
an
end
of
this
.
You
have
come
to
ask
something
of
me
,
you
*NL*
say
?
Well
,
what
?
What
is
it
?
Speak
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Marius
,
with
the
look
of
a
man
who
feels
that
he
is
falling
*NL*
over
a
precipice
,
``
I
have
come
to
ask
your
permission
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
rang
the
bell
.
Basque
opened
the
door
half-way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
my
daughter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
later
,
the
door
was
opened
once
more
,
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
*NL*
did
not
enter
,
but
showed
herself
;
Marius
was
standing
,
mute
,
with
*NL*
pendant
arms
and
the
face
of
a
criminal
;
M.
Gillenormand
was
pacing
back
*NL*
and
forth
in
the
room
.
He
turned
to
his
daughter
and
said
to
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
It
is
Monsieur
Marius
.
Say
good
day
to
him
.
Monsieur
wishes
to
*NL*
marry
.
That
's
all
.
Go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
curt
,
hoarse
sound
of
the
old
man
's
voice
announced
a
strange
degree
*NL*
of
excitement
.
The
aunt
gazed
at
Marius
with
a
frightened
air
,
hardly
*NL*
appeared
to
recognize
him
,
did
not
allow
a
gesture
or
a
syllable
to
*NL*
escape
her
,
and
disappeared
at
her
father
's
breath
more
swiftly
than
a
*NL*
straw
before
the
hurricane
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Father
Gillenormand
had
returned
and
placed
his
back
*NL*
against
the
chimney-piece
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
marry
!
At
one
and
twenty
!
You
have
arranged
that
!
You
have
only
*NL*
a
permission
to
ask
!
a
formality
.
Sit
down
,
sir
.
Well
,
you
have
had
a
*NL*
revolution
since
I
had
the
honor
to
see
you
last
.
The
Jacobins
got
the
*NL*
upper
hand
.
You
must
have
been
delighted
.
Are
you
not
a
Republican
since
*NL*
you
are
a
Baron
?
You
can
make
that
agree
.
The
Republic
makes
a
good
*NL*
sauce
for
the
barony
.
Are
you
one
of
those
decorated
by
July
?
Have
you
*NL*
taken
the
Louvre
at
all
,
sir
?
Quite
near
here
,
in
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
,
*NL*
opposite
the
Rue
des
Nonamdieres
,
there
is
a
cannon-ball
incrusted
in
*NL*
the
wall
of
the
third
story
of
a
house
with
this
inscription
:
`
July
*NL*
28th
,
1830
.
'
Go
take
a
look
at
that
.
It
produces
a
good
effect
.
Ah
!
*NL*
those
friends
of
yours
do
pretty
things
.
By
the
way
,
are
n't
they
*NL*
erecting
a
fountain
in
the
place
of
the
monument
of
M.
le
Duc
de
Berry
?
*NL*
So
you
want
to
marry
?
Whom
?
Can
one
inquire
without
indiscretion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
,
and
,
before
Marius
had
time
to
answer
,
he
added
violently
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
you
have
a
profession
?
A
fortune
made

How
much
do
you
earn
*NL*
at
your
trade
of
lawyer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
''
said
Marius
,
with
a
sort
of
firmness
and
resolution
that
was
*NL*
almost
fierce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
?
Then
all
that
you
have
to
live
upon
is
the
twelve
hundred
*NL*
livres

I
allow
you

*NL*
*NL*
Marius
did
not
reply
.
M.
Gillenormand
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
understand

*NL*
*NL*
``
As

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

ejaculated
the
old
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
exclaimed
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
interrupted
him
with
the
tone
of
a
man
who
is
speaking
*NL*
to
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
one
and
twenty
years
of

worth

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir

''
repeated
Marius
,
in
the
despair
at
the
last
hope
,
which
was
*NL*
vanishing
,
``
I
entreat
you
!
I
conjure
you
in
the
name

clasped

throw
myself
at
your
feet

permit
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
burst
into
a
shout
of
strident
and
mournful
laughter
,
*NL*
coughing
and
laughing
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

ah

to

It

want
to
throw
my
career
,
my
*NL*
future
,
my
youth
,
my
life
to
the
dogs
;
I
wish
to
take
a
plunge
into
*NL*
wretchedness
with
a
woman
around
my
neck
,
that
's
an
idea
,
and
you
must
*NL*
consent
to
it
!

and
the
old
fossil
will
consent

Go

my
lad
,
do
as
*NL*
you
like

attach
your
paving-stone
,
marry
your
Pousselevent

your

Never

never

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
tone
in
which
that
``
never
''
was
uttered
,
Marius
lost
all
hope
.
He
*NL*
traversed
the
chamber
with
slow
steps
,
with
bowed
head
,
tottering
and
*NL*
more
like
a
dying
man
than
like
one
merely
taking
his
departure
.
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
followed
him
with
his
eyes
,
and
at
the
moment
when
the
*NL*
door
opened
,
and
Marius
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
,
he
advanced
four
*NL*
paces
,
with
the
senile
vivacity
of
impetuous
and
spoiled
old
gentlemen
,
*NL*
seized
Marius
by
the
collar
,
brought
him
back
energetically
into
the
*NL*
room
,
flung
him
into
an
armchair
and
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
all
about
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
that
single
word
``
father
''
which
had
effected
this
revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
stared
at
him
in
bewilderment
.
M.
Gillenormand
's
mobile
face
was
*NL*
no
longer
expressive
of
anything
but
rough
and
ineffable
good-nature
.
*NL*
The
grandsire
had
given
way
before
the
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
see
here
,
speak
,
tell
me
about
your
love
affairs
,
jabber
,
tell
me
*NL*
everything
!
Sapristi
!
how
stupid
young
folks
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
--
''
repeated
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
's
entire
countenance
lighted
up
with
indescribable
radiance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
right
,
call
me
father
,
and
you
'll
see
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
now
something
so
kind
,
so
gentle
,
so
openhearted
,
and
so
*NL*
paternal
in
this
brusqueness
,
that
Marius
,
in
the
sudden
transition
from
*NL*
discouragement
to
hope
,
was
stunned
and
intoxicated
by
it
,
as
it
were
.
*NL*
He
was
seated
near
the
table
,
the
light
from
the
candles
brought
out
*NL*
the
dilapidation
of
his
costume
,
which
Father
Gillenormand
regarded
with
*NL*
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
father
--
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
''
interrupted
M.
Gillenormand
,
``
you
really
have
not
a
*NL*
penny
then
?
You
are
dressed
like
a
pickpocket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rummaged
in
a
drawer
,
drew
forth
a
purse
,
which
he
laid
on
the
table
:
*NL*
``
Here
are
a
hundred
louis
,
buy
yourself
a
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
''
pursued
Marius
,
``
my
good
father
,
if
you
only
knew
!
I
love
her
.
*NL*
You
can
not
imagine
it
;
the
first
time
I
saw
her
was
at
the
Luxembourg
,
*NL*
she
came
there
;
in
the
beginning
,
I
did
not
pay
much
heed
to
her
,
and
*NL*
then
,
I
do
n't
know
how
it
came
about
,
I
fell
in
love
with
her
.
Oh
!
how
*NL*
unhappy
that
made
me
!
Now
,
at
last
,
I
see
her
every
day
,
at
her
own
*NL*
home
,
her
father
does
not
know
it
,
just
fancy
,
they
are
going
away
,
it
*NL*
is
in
the
garden
that
we
meet
,
in
the
evening
,
her
father
means
to
take
*NL*
her
to
England
,
then
I
said
to
myself
:
`
I
'll
go
and
see
my
grandfather
*NL*
and
tell
him
all
about
the
affair
.
I
should
go
mad
first
,
I
should
die
,
*NL*
I
should
fall
ill
,
I
should
throw
myself
into
the
water
.
I
absolutely
*NL*
must
marry
her
,
since
I
should
go
mad
otherwise
.

This
is
the
whole
*NL*
truth
,
and
I
do
not
think
that
I
have
omitted
anything

She
lives
in
a
*NL*
garden
with
an
iron
fence

of
the
Invalides

''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
had
seated
himself
,
with
a
beaming
countenance
,
*NL*
beside
Marius
.
As
he
listened
to
him
and
drank
in
the
sound
of
his
*NL*
voice
,
he
enjoyed
at
the
same
time
a
protracted
pinch
of
snuff
.
At
*NL*
the
words
``
Rue
Plumet
''
he
interrupted
his
inhalation
and
allowed
the
*NL*
remainder
of
his
snuff
to
fall
upon
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Why

yes

Your

spoken

about

I
have

heard
of
that

of

in
the
Rue

In
a
*NL*
garden
,
a
Pamela

Your
taste
is
not
bad

She
is
said
to
be
a
very
tidy

creature

Between
ourselves
,
I
think
that
simpleton
of
a
lancer
has
been
*NL*
courting
her
a
bit
.
I
do
n't
know
where
he
did
it
.
However
,
that
's
not
*NL*
to
the
purpose

Besides
,
he
is
not
to
be
believed

He
brags
,
Marius
!
I
*NL*
think
it
quite
proper
that
a
young
man
like
you
should
be
in
love
.
It
's
*NL*
the
right
thing
at
your
age
.
I
like
you
better
as
a
lover
than
as
a
*NL*
Jacobin

I
like
you
better
in
love
with
a
petticoat

sapristi

with
*NL*
twenty
petticoats

than
with
M.

For
my
part
,
I
will
do
*NL*
myself
the
justice
to
say
,
that
in
the
line
of
sans-culottes
,
I
have
*NL*
never
loved
any
one
but
women
.
Pretty
girls
are
pretty
girls
,
the
deuce
!
*NL*
There
's
no
objection
to
that
.
As
for
the
little
one
,
she
receives
you
*NL*
without
her
father
's
knowledge
.
That
's
in
the
established
order
of
*NL*
things
.
I
have
had
adventures
of
that
same
sort
myself
.
More
than
one
.
*NL*
Do
you
know
what
is
done
then
?
One
does
not
take
the
matter
ferociously
;
*NL*
one
does
not
precipitate
himself
into
the
tragic
;
one
does
not
make

says

*NL*
Marius
,
petrified
and
incapable
of
uttering
a
syllable
,
made
a
sign
with
*NL*
his
head
that
he
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
burst
out
laughing
,
winked
his
aged
eye
,
gave
him
a
slap
on
*NL*
the
knee
,
stared
him
full
in
the
face
with
a
mysterious
and
beaming
air
,
*NL*
and
said
to
him
,
with
the
tenderest
of
shrugs
of
the
shoulder
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Booby
!
make

your

*NL*
*NL*
Marius
turned
pale
.
He
had
understood
nothing
of
what
his
grandfather
*NL*
had
just
said
.
This
twaddle
about
the
Rue
Blomet
,
Pamela
,
the
barracks
,
*NL*
the
lancer
,
had
passed
before
Marius
like
a
dissolving
view
.
Nothing
of
*NL*
all
that
could
bear
any
reference
to
Cosette
,
who
was
a
lily
.
The
good
*NL*
man
was
wandering
in
his
mind
.
But
this
wandering
terminated
in
words
*NL*
which
Marius
did
understand
,
and
which
were
a
mortal
insult
to
Cosette
.
*NL*
Those
words
,
``
make
her
your
mistress
,
''
entered
the
heart
of
the
strict
*NL*
young
man
like
a
sword
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
,
picked
up
his
hat
which
lay
on
the
floor
,
and
walked
to
the
*NL*
door
with
a
firm
,
assured
step
.
There
he
turned
round
,
bowed
deeply
to
*NL*
his
grandfather
,
raised
his
head
erect
again
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
years
ago
you
insulted
my
father
;
to-day
you
have
insulted
my
*NL*
wife

I
ask

more
of
you

Farewell

*NL*
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
,
utterly
confounded
,
opened
his
mouth
,
extended
his
*NL*
arms
,
tried
to
rise
,
and
before
he
could
utter
a
word
,
the
door
closed
*NL*
once
more
,
and
Marius
had
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
remained
for
several
minutes
motionless
and
as
though
*NL*
struck
by
lightning
,
without
the
power
to
speak
or
breathe
,
as
though
*NL*
a
clenched
fist
grasped
his
throat
.
At
last
he
tore
himself
from
his
*NL*
arm-chair
,
ran
,
so
far
as
a
man
can
run
at
ninety-one
,
to
the
door
,
*NL*
opened
it
,
and
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
!
Help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
daughter
made
her
appearance
,
then
the
domestics
.
He
began
again
,
*NL*
with
a
pitiful
rattle
:
``
Run
after
him
!
Bring
him
back
!
What
have
I
done
*NL*
to
him
?
He
is
mad

He
is
going
away
!
Ah

my
God
!
Ah
!
my
God
!
This
time
*NL*
he
will
not
come
back
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
window
which
looked
out
on
the
street
,
threw
it
open
with
*NL*
his
aged
and
palsied
hands
,
leaned
out
more
than
half-way
,
while
Basque
*NL*
and
Nicolette
held
him
behind
,
and
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marius

Marius

Marius

*NL*
*NL*
But
Marius
could
no

hear
him
,
for
at
that
moment
he
was
turning
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Saint-Louis

The
octogenarian
raised
his
hands
to
his
temples
two
or
three
times
*NL*
with
an
expression
of
anguish
,
recoiled
tottering
,
and
fell
back
into
an
*NL*
arm-chair
,
pulseless
,
voiceless
,
tearless
,
with
quivering
head
and
lips
*NL*
which
moved
with
a
stupid
air
,
with
nothing
in
his
eyes
and
nothing
*NL*
any
longer
in
his
heart
except
a
gloomy
and
profound
something
which
*NL*
resembled
night

CHAPTER
I
--
JEAN
VALJEAN
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
day
,
towards
four
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
sitting
alone
on
the
back
side
of
one
of
the
most
solitary
slopes
in
the
*NL*
Champ-de-Mars
.
Either
from
prudence
,
or
from
a
desire
to
meditate
,
or
*NL*
simply
in
consequence
of
one
of
those
insensible
changes
of
habit
which
*NL*
gradually
introduce
themselves
into
the
existence
of
every
one
,
he
now
*NL*
rarely
went
out
with
Cosette
.
He
had
on
his
workman
's
waistcoat
,
*NL*
and
trousers
of
gray
linen
;
and
his
long-visored
cap
concealed
his
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
calm
and
happy
now
beside
Cosette
;
that
which
had
,
for
a
time
,
*NL*
alarmed
and
troubled
him
had
been
dissipated
;
but
for
the
last
week
or
*NL*
two
,
anxieties
of
another
nature
had
come
up
.
One
day
,
while
walking
*NL*
on
the
boulevard
,
he
had
caught
sight
of
Thenardier
;
thanks
to
his
*NL*
disguise
,
Thenardier
had
not
recognized
him
;
but
since
that
day
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
had
seen
him
repeatedly
,
and
he
was
now
certain
that
Thenardier
*NL*
was
prowling
about
in
their
neighborhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
been
sufficient
to
make
him
come
to
a
decision
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Paris
was
not
tranquil
:
political
troubles
presented
this
*NL*
inconvenient
feature
,
for
any
one
who
had
anything
to
conceal
in
his
*NL*
life
,
that
the
police
had
grown
very
uneasy
and
very
suspicious
,
and
*NL*
that
while
seeking
to
ferret
out
a
man
like
Pepin
or
Morey
,
they
might
*NL*
very
readily
discover
a
man
like
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
made
up
his
mind
to
quit
Paris
,
and
even
France
,
and
go
*NL*
over
to
England
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
warned
Cosette
.
He
wished
to
set
out
before
the
end
of
the
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
seated
himself
on
the
slope
in
the
Champ-de-Mars
,
turning
over
*NL*
all
sorts
of
thoughts
in
his
mind
,
--
Thenardier
,
the
police
,
the
journey
,
*NL*
and
the
difficulty
of
procuring
a
passport
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
troubled
from
all
these
points
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
Last
of
all
,
an
inexplicable
circumstance
which
had
just
attracted
his
*NL*
attention
,
and
from
which
he
had
not
yet
recovered
,
had
added
to
his
*NL*
state
of
alarm
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
that
very
day
,
when
he
alone
of
the
household
was
*NL*
stirring
,
while
strolling
in
the
garden
before
Cosette
's
shutters
*NL*
were
open
,
he
had
suddenly
perceived
on
the
wall
,
the
following
line
,
*NL*
engraved
,
probably
with
a
nail
:
--
*NL*
*NL*

was
perfectly
fresh
,
the
grooves
in
the
ancient
black
mortar
were
*NL*
white
,
a
tuft
of
nettles
at
the
foot
of
the
wall
was
powdered
with
the
*NL*
fine
,
fresh
plaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
had
probably
been
written
on
the
preceding
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
this
?
A
signal
for
others
?
A
warning
for
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
any
case
,
it
was
evident
that
the
garden
had
been
violated
,
and
that
*NL*
strangers
had
made
their
way
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recalled
the
odd
incidents
which
had
already
alarmed
the
household
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
was
now
filling
in
this
canvas
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
good
care
not
to
speak
to
Cosette
of
the
line
written
on
the
*NL*
wall
,
for
fear
of
alarming
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
his
preoccupations
,
he
perceived
,
from
a
shadow
cast
by
*NL*
the
sun
,
that
some
one
had
halted
on
the
crest
of
the
slope
immediately
*NL*
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
on
the
point
of
turning
round
,
when
a
paper
folded
in
four
fell
*NL*
upon
his
knees
as
though
a
hand
had
dropped
it
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
paper
,
unfolded
it
,
and
read
these
words
written
in
large
*NL*
characters
,
with
a
pencil
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MOVE
AWAY
FROM
YOUR
HOUSE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
sprang
hastily
to
his
feet
;
there
was
no
one
on
the
slope
;
*NL*
he
gazed
all
around
him
and
perceived
a
creature
larger
than
a
*NL*
child
,
not
so
large
as
a
man
,
clad
in
a
gray
blouse
and
trousers
of
*NL*
dust-colored
cotton
velvet
,
who
was
jumping
over
the
parapet
and
who
*NL*
slipped
into
the
moat
of
the
Champde-Mars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
returned
home
at
once
,
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
.

CHAPTER
II
--
MARIUS
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
left
M.
Gillenormand
in
despair
.
He
had
entered
the
house
*NL*
with
very
little
hope
,
and
quitted
it
with
immense
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
and
those
who
have
observed
the
depths
of
the
human
heart
will
*NL*
understand
this
,
the
officer
,
the
lancer
,
the
ninny
,
Cousin
Theodule
,
*NL*
had
left
no
trace
in
his
mind
.
Not
the
slightest
.
The
dramatic
poet
*NL*
might
,
apparently
,
expect
some
complications
from
this
revelation
made
*NL*
point-blank
by
the
grandfather
to
the
grandson
.
But
what
the
drama
would
*NL*
gain
thereby
,
truth
would
lose
.
Marius
was
at
an
age
when
one
believes
*NL*
nothing
in
the
line
of
evil
;
later
on
comes
the
age
when
one
believes
*NL*
everything
.
Suspicions
are
nothing
else
than
wrinkles
.
Early
youth
*NL*
has
none
of
them
.
That
which
overwhelmed
Othello
glides
innocuous
over
*NL*
Candide
.
Suspect
Cosette
!
There
are
hosts
of
crimes
which
Marius
could
*NL*
sooner
have
committed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
wander
about
the
streets
,
the
resource
of
those
who
suffer
.
*NL*
He
thought
of
nothing
,
so
far
as
he
could
afterwards
remember
.
At
two
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
morning
he
returned
to
Courfeyrac
's
quarters
and
flung
*NL*
himself
,
without
undressing
,
on
his
mattress
.
The
sun
was
shining
*NL*
brightly
when
he
sank
into
that
frightful
leaden
slumber
which
permits
*NL*
ideas
to
go
and
come
in
the
brain
.
When
he
awoke
,
he
saw
Courfeyrac
,
*NL*
Enjolras
,
Feuilly
,
and
Combeferre
standing
in
the
room
with
their
hats
*NL*
on
and
all
ready
to
go
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
coming
to
General
Lamarque
's
funeral
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
him
that
Courfeyrac
was
speaking
Chinese
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
out
some
time
after
them
.
He
put
in
his
pocket
the
pistols
which
*NL*
Javert
had
given
him
at
the
time
of
the
adventure
on
the
3d
of
February
,
*NL*
and
which
had
remained
in
his
hands
.
These
pistols
were
still
loaded
.
It
*NL*
would
be
difficult
to
say
what
vague
thought
he
had
in
his
mind
when
he
*NL*
took
them
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
long
he
prowled
about
,
without
knowing
where
he
was
going
;
it
*NL*
rained
at
times
,
he
did
not
perceive
it
;
for
his
dinner
,
he
purchased
a
*NL*
penny
roll
at
a
baker
's
,
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
forgot
it
.
It
appears
*NL*
that
he
took
a
bath
in
the
Seine
without
being
aware
of
it
.
There
are
*NL*
moments
when
a
man
has
a
furnace
within
his
skull
.
Marius
was
passing
*NL*
through
one
of
those
moments
.
He
no
longer
hoped
for
anything
;
this
*NL*
step
he
had
taken
since
the
preceding
evening
.
He
waited
for
night
with
*NL*
feverish
impatience
,
he
had
but
one
idea
clearly
before
his
mind
;
--
this
*NL*
was
,
that
at
nine
o'clock
he
should
see
Cosette
.
This
last
happiness
*NL*
now
constituted
his
whole
future
;
after
that
,
gloom
.
At
intervals
,
as
*NL*
he
roamed
through
the
most
deserted
boulevards
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
*NL*
heard
strange
noises
in
Paris
.
He
thrust
his
head
out
of
his
revery
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Is
there
fighting
on
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
nightfall
,
at
nine
o'clock
precisely
,
as
he
had
promised
Cosette
,
*NL*
he
was
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
When
he
approached
the
grating
he
forgot
*NL*
everything
.
It
was
forty-eight
hours
since
he
had
seen
Cosette
;
he
was
*NL*
about
to
behold
her
once
more
;
every
other
thought
was
effaced
,
and
*NL*
he
felt
only
a
profound
and
unheard-of
joy
.
Those
minutes
in
which
one
*NL*
lives
centuries
always
have
this
sovereign
and
wonderful
property
,
that
*NL*
at
the
moment
when
they
are
passing
they
fill
the
heart
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
displaced
the
bar
,
and
rushed
headlong
into
the
garden
.
Cosette
*NL*
was
not
at
the
spot
where
she
ordinarily
waited
for
him
.
He
traversed
*NL*
the
thicket
,
and
approached
the
recess
near
the
flight
of
steps
:
``
She
*NL*
is
waiting
for
me
there
,
''
said
he
.
Cosette
was
not
there
.
He
raised
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
saw
that
the
shutters
of
the
house
were
closed
.
He
made
the
*NL*
tour
of
the
garden
,
the
garden
was
deserted
.
Then
he
returned
to
*NL*
the
house
,
and
,
rendered
senseless
by
love
,
intoxicated
,
terrified
,
*NL*
exasperated
with
grief
and
uneasiness
,
like
a
master
who
returns
home
at
*NL*
an
evil
hour
,
he
tapped
on
the
shutters
.
He
knocked
and
knocked
again
,
*NL*
at
the
risk
of
seeing
the
window
open
,
and
her
father
's
gloomy
face
*NL*
make
its
appearance
,
and
demand
:
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
This
was
nothing
in
*NL*
comparison
with
what
he
dimly
caught
a
glimpse
of
.
When
he
had
rapped
,
*NL*
he
lifted
up
his
voice
and
called
Cosette
.
--
``
Cosette
!
''
he
cried
;
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
he
repeated
imperiously
.
There
was
no
reply
.
All
was
over
.
No
*NL*
one
in
the
garden
;
no
one
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
fixed
his
despairing
eyes
on
that
dismal
house
,
which
was
as
*NL*
black
and
as
silent
as
a
tomb
and
far
more
empty
.
He
gazed
at
the
stone
*NL*
seat
on
which
he
had
passed
so
many
adorable
hours
with
Cosette
.
Then
he
*NL*
seated
himself
on
the
flight
of
steps
,
his
heart
filled
with
sweetness
*NL*
and
resolution
,
he
blessed
his
love
in
the
depths
of
his
thought
,
and
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
that
,
since
Cosette
was
gone
,
all
that
there
was
left
*NL*
for
him
was
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
heard
a
voice
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
street
,
*NL*
and
which
was
calling
to
him
through
the
trees
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Marius
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Marius
,
are
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Marius
,
''
went
on
the
voice
,
``
your
friends
are
waiting
for
you
at
*NL*
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
voice
was
not
wholly
unfamiliar
to
him
.
It
resembled
the
hoarse
,
*NL*
rough
voice
of
Eponine
.
Marius
hastened
to
the
gate
,
thrust
aside
the
*NL*
movable
bar
,
passed
his
head
through
the
aperture
,
and
saw
some
one
who
*NL*
appeared
to
him
to
be
a
young
man
,
disappearing
at
a
run
into
the
gloom
.

CHAPTER
III
--
M.
MABEUF
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
purse
was
of
no
use
to
M.
Mabeuf
.
M.
Mabeuf
,
in
his
*NL*
venerable
,
infantile
austerity
,
had
not
accepted
the
gift
of
the
stars
;
*NL*
he
had
not
admitted
that
a
star
could
coin
itself
into
louis
d'or
.
He
*NL*
had
not
divined
that
what
had
fallen
from
heaven
had
come
from
Gavroche
.
*NL*
He
had
taken
the
purse
to
the
police
commissioner
of
the
quarter
,
as
*NL*
a
lost
article
placed
by
the
finder
at
the
disposal
of
claimants
.
The
*NL*
purse
was
actually
lost
.
It
is
unnecessary
to
say
that
no
one
claimed
*NL*
it
,
and
that
it
did
not
succor
M.
Mabeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
M.
Mabeuf
had
continued
his
downward
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
experiments
on
indigo
had
been
no
more
successful
in
the
Jardin
des
*NL*
Plantes
than
in
his
garden
at
Austerlitz
.
The
year
before
he
had
owed
*NL*
his
housekeeper
's
wages
;
now
,
as
we
have
seen
,
he
owed
three
quarters
*NL*
of
his
rent
.
The
pawnshop
had
sold
the
plates
of
his
Flora
after
the
*NL*
expiration
of
thirteen
months
.
Some
coppersmith
had
made
stewpans
of
*NL*
them
.
His
copper
plates
gone
,
and
being
unable
to
complete
even
the
*NL*
incomplete
copies
of
his
Flora
which
were
in
his
possession
,
he
had
*NL*
disposed
of
the
text
,
at
a
miserable
price
,
as
waste
paper
,
to
a
*NL*
second-hand
bookseller
.
Nothing
now
remained
to
him
of
his
life
's
work
.
*NL*
He
set
to
work
to
eat
up
the
money
for
these
copies
.
When
he
saw
that
*NL*
this
wretched
resource
was
becoming
exhausted
,
he
gave
up
his
garden
*NL*
and
allowed
it
to
run
to
waste
.
Before
this
,
a
long
time
before
,
he
had
*NL*
given
up
his
two
eggs
and
the
morsel
of
beef
which
he
ate
from
time
*NL*
to
time
.
He
dined
on
bread
and
potatoes
.
He
had
sold
the
last
of
his
*NL*
furniture
,
then
all
duplicates
of
his
bedding
,
his
clothing
and
his
*NL*
blankets
,
then
his
herbariums
and
prints
;
but
he
still
retained
his
most
*NL*
precious
books
,
many
of
which
were
of
the
greatest
rarity
,
among
others
,
*NL*
Les
Quadrins
Historiques
de
la
Bible
,
edition
of
1560
;
La
Concordance
*NL*
des
Bibles
,
by
Pierre
de
Besse
;
Les
Marguerites
de
la
Marguerite
,
of
*NL*
Jean
de
La
Haye
,
with
a
dedication
to
the
Queen
of
Navarre
;
the
book
de
*NL*
la
Charge
et
Dignite
de
l'Ambassadeur
,
by
the
Sieur
de
Villiers
*NL*
Hotman
;
a
Florilegium
Rabbinicum
of
1644
;
a
Tibullus
of
1567
,
with
this
*NL*
magnificent
inscription
:
Venetiis
,
in
aedibus
Manutianis
;
and
lastly
,
a
*NL*
Diogenes
Laertius
,
printed
at
Lyons
in
1644
,
which
contained
the
famous
*NL*
variant
of
the
manuscript
411
,
thirteenth
century
,
of
the
Vatican
,
and
*NL*
those
of
the
two
manuscripts
of
Venice
,
393
and
394
,
consulted
with
*NL*
such
fruitful
results
by
Henri
Estienne
,
and
all
the
passages
in
Doric
*NL*
dialect
which
are
only
found
in
the
celebrated
manuscript
of
the
twelfth
*NL*
century
belonging
to
the
Naples
Library
.
M.
Mabeuf
never
had
any
fire
*NL*
in
his
chamber
,
and
went
to
bed
at
sundown
,
in
order
not
to
consume
*NL*
any
candles
.
It
seemed
as
though
he
had
no
longer
any
neighbors
:
people
*NL*
avoided
him
when
he
went
out
;
he
perceived
the
fact
.
The
wretchedness
of
*NL*
a
child
interests
a
mother
,
the
wretchedness
of
a
young
man
interests
a
*NL*
young
girl
,
the
wretchedness
of
an
old
man
interests
no
one
.
It
is
,
of
*NL*
all
distresses
,
the
coldest
.
Still
,
Father
Mabeuf
had
not
entirely
lost
*NL*
his
childlike
serenity
.
His
eyes
acquired
some
vivacity
when
they
rested
*NL*
on
his
books
,
and
he
smiled
when
he
gazed
at
the
Diogenes
Laertius
,
*NL*
which
was
a
unique
copy
.
His
bookcase
with
glass
doors
was
the
*NL*
only
piece
of
furniture
which
he
had
kept
beyond
what
was
strictly
*NL*
indispensable
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
Mother
Plutarque
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
money
to
buy
any
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
she
called
dinner
was
a
loaf
of
bread
and
four
or
five
potatoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
credit
?
''
suggested
M.
Mabeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
well
that
people
refuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
opened
his
bookcase
,
took
a
long
look
at
all
his
books
,
one
*NL*
after
another
,
as
a
father
obliged
to
decimate
his
children
would
gaze
*NL*
upon
them
before
making
a
choice
,
then
seized
one
hastily
,
put
it
*NL*
in
under
his
arm
and
went
out
.
He
returned
two
hours
later
,
without
*NL*
anything
under
his
arm
,
laid
thirty
sous
on
the
table
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
get
something
for
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
moment
forth
,
Mother
Plutarque
saw
a
sombre
veil
,
which
was
*NL*
never
more
lifted
,
descend
over
the
old
man
's
candid
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
on
the
day
after
,
and
on
the
day
after
that
,
it
*NL*
had
to
be
done
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
went
out
with
a
book
and
returned
with
a
coin
.
As
the
*NL*
second-hand
dealers
perceived
that
he
was
forced
to
sell
,
they
purchased
*NL*
of
him
for
twenty
sous
that
for
which
he
had
paid
twenty
francs
,
*NL*
sometimes
at
those
very
shops
.
Volume
by
volume
,
the
whole
library
*NL*
went
the
same
road
.
He
said
at
times
:
``
But
I
am
eighty
;
''
as
though
he
*NL*
cherished
some
secret
hope
that
he
should
arrive
at
the
end
of
his
days
*NL*
before
reaching
the
end
of
his
books
.
His
melancholy
increased
.
Once
,
*NL*
however
,
he
had
a
pleasure
.
He
had
gone
out
with
a
Robert
Estienne
,
*NL*
which
he
had
sold
for
thirty-five
sous
under
the
Quai
Malaquais
,
and
he
*NL*
returned
with
an
Aldus
which
he
had
bought
for
forty
sous
in
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Gres
.
--
``
I
owe
five
sous
,
''
he
said
,
beaming
on
Mother
Plutarque
.
That
day
*NL*
he
had
no
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
belonged
to
the
Horticultural
Society
.
His
destitution
became
known
*NL*
there
.
The
president
of
the
society
came
to
see
him
,
promised
to
*NL*
speak
to
the
Minister
of
Agriculture
and
Commerce
about
him
,
and
did
*NL*
so
.
--
``
Why
,
what
!
''
exclaimed
the
Minister
,
``
I
should
think
so
!
An
old
*NL*
savant
!
a
botanist
!
an
inoffensive
man
!
Something
must
be
done
for
him
!
''
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
M.
Mabeuf
received
an
invitation
to
dine
with
the
*NL*
Minister
.
Trembling
with
joy
,
he
showed
the
letter
to
Mother
Plutarque
.
*NL*
``
We
are
saved
!
''
said
he
.
On
the
day
appointed
,
he
went
to
the
Minister
's
*NL*
house
.
He
perceived
that
his
ragged
cravat
,
his
long
,
square
coat
,
and
*NL*
his
waxed
shoes
astonished
the
ushers
.
No
one
spoke
to
him
,
not
even
the
*NL*
Minister
.
About
ten
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
while
he
was
still
waiting
*NL*
for
a
word
,
he
heard
the
Minister
's
wife
,
a
beautiful
woman
in
a
*NL*
low-necked
gown
whom
he
had
not
ventured
to
approach
,
inquire
:
``
Who
is
*NL*
that
old
gentleman
?
''
He
returned
home
on
foot
at
midnight
,
in
a
driving
*NL*
rain-storm
.
He
had
sold
an
Elzevir
to
pay
for
a
carriage
in
which
to
go
*NL*
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
acquired
the
habit
of
reading
a
few
pages
in
his
Diogenes
*NL*
Laertius
every
night
,
before
he
went
to
bed
.
He
knew
enough
Greek
to
*NL*
enjoy
the
peculiarities
of
the
text
which
he
owned
.
He
had
now
no
other
*NL*
enjoyment
.
Several
weeks
passed
.
All
at
once
,
Mother
Plutarque
fell
ill
.
*NL*
There
is
one
thing
sadder
than
having
no
money
with
which
to
buy
bread
*NL*
at
the
baker
's
and
that
is
having
no
money
to
purchase
drugs
at
the
*NL*
apothecary
's
.
One
evening
,
the
doctor
had
ordered
a
very
expensive
*NL*
potion
.
And
the
malady
was
growing
worse
;
a
nurse
was
required
.
M.
*NL*
Mabeuf
opened
his
bookcase
;
there
was
nothing
there
.
The
last
volume
had
*NL*
taken
its
departure
.
All
that
was
left
to
him
was
Diogenes
Laertius
.
*NL*
He
put
this
unique
copy
under
his
arm
,
and
went
out
.
It
was
the
4th
of
*NL*
June
,
1832
;
he
went
to
the
Porte
Saint-Jacques
,
to
Royal
's
successor
,
*NL*
and
returned
with
one
hundred
francs
.
He
laid
the
pile
of
five-franc
*NL*
pieces
on
the
old
serving-woman
's
nightstand
,
and
returned
to
his
*NL*
chamber
without
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
morning
,
at
dawn
,
he
seated
himself
on
the
overturned
*NL*
post
in
his
garden
,
and
he
could
be
seen
over
the
top
of
the
hedge
,
*NL*
sitting
the
whole
morning
motionless
,
with
drooping
head
,
his
eyes
*NL*
vaguely
fixed
on
the
withered
flower-beds
.
It
rained
at
intervals
;
the
*NL*
old
man
did
not
seem
to
perceive
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
,
extraordinary
noises
broke
out
in
Paris
.
They
*NL*
resembled
shots
and
the
clamors
of
a
multitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Mabeuf
raised
his
head
.
He
saw
a
gardener
passing
,
and
*NL*
inquired
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gardener
,
spade
on
back
,
replied
in
the
most
unconcerned
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
riots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
riots
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
are
fighting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
they
fighting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
Heavens
!
''
ejaculated
the
gardener
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
direction
?
''
went
on
M.
Mabeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
neighborhood
of
the
Arsenal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Mabeuf
went
to
his
room
,
took
his
hat
,
mechanically
sought
for
a
*NL*
book
to
place
under
his
arm
,
found
none
,
said
:
``
Ah
!
truly
!
''
and
went
off
*NL*
with
a
bewildered
air
.

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
SURFACE
OF
THE
QUESTION
*NL*
*NL*
Of
what
is
revolt
composed
?
Of
nothing
and
of
everything
.
Of
an
*NL*
electricity
disengaged
,
little
by
little
,
of
a
flame
suddenly
darting
*NL*
forth
,
of
a
wandering
force
,
of
a
passing
breath
.
This
breath
encounters
*NL*
heads
which
speak
,
brains
which
dream
,
souls
which
suffer
,
passions
*NL*
which
burn
,
wretchedness
which
howls
,
and
bears
them
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whither
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
random
.
Athwart
the
state
,
the
laws
,
athwart
prosperity
and
the
*NL*
insolence
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Irritated
convictions
,
embittered
enthusiasms
,
agitated
indignations
,
*NL*
instincts
of
war
which
have
been
repressed
,
youthful
courage
which
has
*NL*
been
exalted
,
generous
blindness
;
curiosity
,
the
taste
for
change
,
*NL*
the
thirst
for
the
unexpected
,
the
sentiment
which
causes
one
to
*NL*
take
pleasure
in
reading
the
posters
for
the
new
play
,
and
love
,
*NL*
the
prompter
's
whistle
,
at
the
theatre
;
the
vague
hatreds
,
rancors
,
*NL*
disappointments
,
every
vanity
which
thinks
that
destiny
has
bankrupted
*NL*
it
;
discomfort
,
empty
dreams
,
ambitious
that
are
hedged
about
,
whoever
*NL*
hopes
for
a
downfall
,
some
outcome
,
in
short
,
at
the
very
bottom
,
the
*NL*
rabble
,
that
mud
which
catches
fire
,
--
such
are
the
elements
of
revolt
.
*NL*
That
which
is
grandest
and
that
which
is
basest
;
the
beings
who
prowl
*NL*
outside
of
all
bounds
,
awaiting
an
occasion
,
bohemians
,
vagrants
,
*NL*
vagabonds
of
the
cross-roads
,
those
who
sleep
at
night
in
a
desert
of
*NL*
houses
with
no
other
roof
than
the
cold
clouds
of
heaven
,
those
who
,
*NL*
each
day
,
demand
their
bread
from
chance
and
not
from
toil
,
the
unknown
*NL*
of
poverty
and
nothingness
,
the
bare-armed
,
the
bare-footed
,
belong
to
*NL*
revolt
.
Whoever
cherishes
in
his
soul
a
secret
revolt
against
any
deed
*NL*
whatever
on
the
part
of
the
state
,
of
life
or
of
fate
,
is
ripe
for
riot
,
*NL*
and
,
as
soon
as
it
makes
its
appearance
,
he
begins
to
quiver
,
and
to
*NL*
feel
himself
borne
away
with
the
whirlwind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revolt
is
a
sort
of
waterspout
in
the
social
atmosphere
which
forms
*NL*
suddenly
in
certain
conditions
of
temperature
,
and
which
,
as
it
eddies
*NL*
about
,
mounts
,
descends
,
thunders
,
tears
,
razes
,
crushes
,
demolishes
,
*NL*
uproots
,
bearing
with
it
great
natures
and
small
,
the
strong
man
and
the
*NL*
feeble
mind
,
the
tree
trunk
and
the
stalk
of
straw
.
Woe
to
him
whom
it
*NL*
bears
away
as
well
as
to
him
whom
it
strikes
!
It
breaks
the
one
against
*NL*
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
communicates
to
those
whom
it
seizes
an
indescribable
and
*NL*
extraordinary
power
.
It
fills
the
first-comer
with
the
force
of
events
;
*NL*
it
converts
everything
into
projectiles
.
It
makes
a
cannon-ball
of
a
*NL*
rough
stone
,
and
a
general
of
a
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
are
to
believe
certain
oracles
of
crafty
political
views
,
a
little
*NL*
revolt
is
desirable
from
the
point
of
view
of
power
.
System
:
revolt
*NL*
strengthens
those
governments
which
it
does
not
overthrow
.
It
puts
*NL*
the
army
to
the
test
;
it
consecrates
the
bourgeoisie
,
it
draws
out
*NL*
the
muscles
of
the
police
;
it
demonstrates
the
force
of
the
social
*NL*
framework
.
It
is
an
exercise
in
gymnastics
;
it
is
almost
hygiene
.
Power
*NL*
is
in
better
health
after
a
revolt
,
as
a
man
is
after
a
good
rubbing
*NL*
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revolt
,
thirty
years
ago
,
was
regarded
from
still
other
points
of
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
for
everything
a
theory
,
which
proclaims
itself
``
good
sense
''
;
*NL*
Philintus
against
Alcestis
;
mediation
offered
between
the
false
and
the
*NL*
true
;
explanation
,
admonition
,
rather
haughty
extenuation
which
,
because
*NL*
it
is
mingled
with
blame
and
excuse
,
thinks
itself
wisdom
,
and
is
often
*NL*
only
pedantry
.
A
whole
political
school
called
``
the
golden
mean
''
has
*NL*
been
the
outcome
of
this
.
As
between
cold
water
and
hot
water
,
it
is
*NL*
the
lukewarm
water
party
.
This
school
with
its
false
depth
,
all
on
the
*NL*
surface
,
which
dissects
effects
without
going
back
to
first
causes
,
*NL*
chides
from
its
height
of
a
demi-science
,
the
agitation
of
the
public
*NL*
square
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
we
listen
to
this
school
,
``
The
riots
which
complicated
the
affair
*NL*
of
1830
deprived
that
great
event
of
a
portion
of
its
purity
.
The
*NL*
Revolution
of
July
had
been
a
fine
popular
gale
,
abruptly
followed
*NL*
by
blue
sky
.
They
made
the
cloudy
sky
reappear
.
They
caused
that
*NL*
revolution
,
at
first
so
remarkable
for
its
unanimity
,
to
degenerate
into
*NL*
a
quarrel
.
In
the
Revolution
of
July
,
as
in
all
progress
accomplished
by
*NL*
fits
and
starts
,
there
had
been
secret
fractures
;
these
riots
rendered
*NL*
them
perceptible
.
It
might
have
been
said
:
`
Ah
!
this
is
broken
.
'
After
*NL*
the
Revolution
of
July
,
one
was
sensible
only
of
deliverance
;
after
the
*NL*
riots
,
one
was
conscious
of
a
catastrophe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
revolt
closes
the
shops
,
depresses
the
funds
,
throws
the
Exchange
*NL*
into
consternation
,
suspends
commerce
,
clogs
business
,
precipitates
*NL*
failures
;
no
more
money
,
private
fortunes
rendered
uneasy
,
public
credit
*NL*
shaken
,
industry
disconcerted
,
capital
withdrawing
,
work
at
a
discount
,
*NL*
fear
everywhere
;
counter-shocks
in
every
town
.
Hence
gulfs
.
It
has
been
*NL*
calculated
that
the
first
day
of
a
riot
costs
France
twenty
millions
,
*NL*
the
second
day
forty
,
the
third
sixty
,
a
three
days
'
uprising
costs
*NL*
one
hundred
and
twenty
millions
,
that
is
to
say
,
if
only
the
financial
*NL*
result
be
taken
into
consideration
,
it
is
equivalent
to
a
disaster
,
a
*NL*
shipwreck
or
a
lost
battle
,
which
should
annihilate
a
fleet
of
sixty
*NL*
ships
of
the
line
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
,
historically
,
uprisings
have
their
beauty
;
the
war
of
the
*NL*
pavements
is
no
less
grandiose
,
and
no
less
pathetic
,
than
the
war
of
*NL*
thickets
:
in
the
one
there
is
the
soul
of
forests
,
in
the
other
the
*NL*
heart
of
cities
;
the
one
has
Jean
Chouan
,
the
other
has
a
Jeanne
.
*NL*
Revolts
have
illuminated
with
a
red
glare
all
the
most
original
points
*NL*
of
the
Parisian
character
,
generosity
,
devotion
,
stormy
gayety
,
students
*NL*
proving
that
bravery
forms
part
of
intelligence
,
the
National
Guard
*NL*
invincible
,
bivouacs
of
shopkeepers
,
fortresses
of
street
urchins
,
*NL*
contempt
of
death
on
the
part
of
passers-by
.
Schools
and
legions
clashed
*NL*
together
.
After
all
,
between
the
combatants
,
there
was
only
a
difference
*NL*
of
age
;
the
race
is
the
same
;
it
is
the
same
stoical
men
who
died
at
the
*NL*
age
of
twenty
for
their
ideas
,
at
forty
for
their
families
.
The
*NL*
army
,
always
a
sad
thing
in
civil
wars
,
opposed
prudence
to
audacity
.
*NL*
Uprisings
,
while
proving
popular
intrepidity
,
also
educated
the
courage
*NL*
of
the
bourgeois
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
well
.
But
is
all
this
worth
the
bloodshed
?
And
to
the
bloodshed
*NL*
add
the
future
darkness
,
progress
compromised
,
uneasiness
among
the
*NL*
best
men
,
honest
liberals
in
despair
,
foreign
absolutism
happy
in
these
*NL*
wounds
dealt
to
revolution
by
its
own
hand
,
the
vanquished
of
1830
*NL*
triumphing
and
saying
:
`
We
told
you
so
!
'
Add
Paris
enlarged
,
possibly
,
*NL*
but
France
most
assuredly
diminished
.
Add
,
for
all
must
needs
be
told
,
*NL*
the
massacres
which
have
too
often
dishonored
the
victory
of
order
grown
*NL*
ferocious
over
liberty
gone
mad
.
To
sum
up
all
,
uprisings
have
been
*NL*
disastrous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
speaks
that
approximation
to
wisdom
with
which
the
bourgeoisie
,
*NL*
that
approximation
to
the
people
,
so
willingly
contents
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
our
parts
,
we
reject
this
word
uprisings
as
too
large
,
and
*NL*
consequently
as
too
convenient
.
We
make
a
distinction
between
one
*NL*
popular
movement
and
another
popular
movement
.
We
do
not
inquire
whether
*NL*
an
uprising
costs
as
much
as
a
battle
.
Why
a
battle
,
in
the
first
place
?
*NL*
Here
the
question
of
war
comes
up
.
Is
war
less
of
a
scourge
than
an
*NL*
uprising
is
of
a
calamity
?
And
then
,
are
all
uprisings
calamities
?
And
*NL*
what
if
the
revolt
of
July
did
cost
a
hundred
and
twenty
millions
?
The
*NL*
establishment
of
Philip
V.
in
Spain
cost
France
two
milliards
.
Even
at
*NL*
the
same
price
,
we
should
prefer
the
14th
of
July
.
However
,
we
reject
*NL*
these
figures
,
which
appear
to
be
reasons
and
which
are
only
words
.
An
*NL*
uprising
being
given
,
we
examine
it
by
itself
.
In
all
that
is
said
by
*NL*
the
doctrinarian
objection
above
presented
,
there
is
no
question
of
*NL*
anything
but
effect
,
we
seek
the
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
be
explicit

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
ROOT
OF
THE
MATTER
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
such
a
thing
as
an
uprising
,
and
there
is
such
a
thing
as
*NL*
insurrection
;
these
are
two
separate
phases
of
wrath
;
one
is
in
the
*NL*
wrong
,
the
other
is
in
the
right
.
In
democratic
states
,
the
only
ones
*NL*
which
are
founded
on
justice
,
it
sometimes
happens
that
the
fraction
*NL*
usurps
;
then
the
whole
rises
and
the
necessary
claim
of
its
rights
may
*NL*
proceed
as
far
as
resort
to
arms
.
In
all
questions
which
result
from
*NL*
collective
sovereignty
,
the
war
of
the
whole
against
the
fraction
is
*NL*
insurrection
;
the
attack
of
the
fraction
against
the
whole
is
revolt
;
*NL*
according
as
the
Tuileries
contain
a
king
or
the
Convention
,
they
*NL*
are
justly
or
unjustly
attacked
.
The
same
cannon
,
pointed
against
the
*NL*
populace
,
is
wrong
on
the
10th
of
August
,
and
right
on
the
14th
of
*NL*
Vendemiaire
.
Alike
in
appearance
,
fundamentally
different
in
reality
;
*NL*
the
Swiss
defend
the
false
,
Bonaparte
defends
the
true
.
That
which
*NL*
universal
suffrage
has
effected
in
its
liberty
and
in
its
sovereignty
*NL*
can
not
be
undone
by
the
street
.
It
is
the
same
in
things
pertaining
*NL*
purely
to
civilization
;
the
instinct
of
the
masses
,
clear-sighted
*NL*
to-day
,
may
be
troubled
to-morrow
.
The
same
fury
legitimate
when
*NL*
directed
against
Terray
and
absurd
when
directed
against
Turgot
.
The
*NL*
destruction
of
machines
,
the
pillage
of
warehouses
,
the
breaking
of
*NL*
rails
,
the
demolition
of
docks
,
the
false
routes
of
multitudes
,
the
*NL*
refusal
by
the
people
of
justice
to
progress
,
Ramus
assassinated
by
*NL*
students
,
Rousseau
driven
out
of
Switzerland
and
stoned
,
--
that
is
*NL*
revolt
.
Israel
against
Moses
,
Athens
against
Phocian
,
Rome
against
*NL*
Cicero
,
--
that
is
an
uprising
;
Paris
against
the
Bastille
,
--
that
is
*NL*
insurrection
.
The
soldiers
against
Alexander
,
the
sailors
against
*NL*
Christopher
Columbus
,
--
this
is
the
same
revolt
;
impious
revolt
;
*NL*
why
?
Because
Alexander
is
doing
for
Asia
with
the
sword
that
which
*NL*
Christopher
Columbus
is
doing
for
America
with
the
compass
;
Alexander
*NL*
like
Columbus
,
is
finding
a
world
.
These
gifts
of
a
world
to
*NL*
civilization
are
such
augmentations
of
light
,
that
all
resistance
in
*NL*
that
case
is
culpable
.
Sometimes
the
populace
counterfeits
fidelity
to
*NL*
itself
.
The
masses
are
traitors
to
the
people
.
Is
there
,
for
example
,
*NL*
anything
stranger
than
that
long
and
bloody
protest
of
dealers
in
*NL*
contraband
salt
,
a
legitimate
chronic
revolt
,
which
,
at
the
decisive
*NL*
moment
,
on
the
day
of
salvation
,
at
the
very
hour
of
popular
victory
,
*NL*
espouses
the
throne
,
turns
into
chouannerie
,
and
,
from
having
been
an
*NL*
insurrection
against
,
becomes
an
uprising
for
,
sombre
masterpieces
of
*NL*
ignorance
!
The
contraband
salt
dealer
escapes
the
royal
gibbets
,
and
*NL*
with
a
rope
's
end
round
his
neck
,
mounts
the
white
cockade
.
``
Death
to
*NL*
the
salt
duties
,
''
brings
forth
,
``
Long
live
the
King
!
''
The
assassins
of
*NL*
Saint-Barthelemy
,
the
cut-throats
of
September
,
the
manslaughterers
of
*NL*
Avignon
,
the
assassins
of
Coligny
,
the
assassins
of
Madam
Lamballe
,
the
*NL*
assassins
of
Brune
,
Miquelets
,
Verdets
,
Cadenettes
,
the
companions
of
*NL*
Jehu
,
the
chevaliers
of
Brassard
,
--
behold
an
uprising
.
La
Vendee
is
*NL*
a
grand
,
catholic
uprising
.
The
sound
of
right
in
movement
is
*NL*
recognizable
,
it
does
not
always
proceed
from
the
trembling
of
excited
*NL*
masses
;
there
are
mad
rages
,
there
are
cracked
bells
,
all
tocsins
do
not
*NL*
give
out
the
sound
of
bronze
.
The
brawl
of
passions
and
ignorances
*NL*
is
quite
another
thing
from
the
shock
of
progress
.
Show
me
in
what
*NL*
direction
you
are
going
.
Rise
,
if
you
will
,
but
let
it
be
that
you
may
*NL*
grow
great
.
There
is
no
insurrection
except
in
a
forward
direction
.
Any
*NL*
other
sort
of
rising
is
bad
;
every
violent
step
towards
the
rear
is
a
*NL*
revolt
;
to
retreat
is
to
commit
a
deed
of
violence
against
the
human
*NL*
race
.
Insurrection
is
a
fit
of
rage
on
the
part
of
truth
;
the
pavements
*NL*
which
the
uprising
disturbs
give
forth
the
spark
of
right
.
These
*NL*
pavements
bequeath
to
the
uprising
only
their
mud
.
Danton
against
Louis
*NL*
XIV
.
is
insurrection
;
Hebert
against
Danton
is
revolt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
it
results
that
if
insurrection
in
given
cases
may
be
,
as
*NL*
Lafayette
says
,
the
most
holy
of
duties
,
an
uprising
may
be
the
most
*NL*
fatal
of
crimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
also
a
difference
in
the
intensity
of
heat
;
insurrection
is
*NL*
often
a
volcano
,
revolt
is
often
only
a
fire
of
straw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revolt
,
as
we
have
said
,
is
sometimes
found
among
those
in
power
.
*NL*
Polignac
is
a
rioter
;
Camille
Desmoulins
is
one
of
the
governing
powers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Insurrection
is
sometimes
resurrection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solution
of
everything
by
universal
suffrage
being
an
absolutely
*NL*
modern
fact
,
and
all
history
anterior
to
this
fact
being
,
for
the
space
*NL*
of
four
thousand
years
,
filled
with
violated
right
,
and
the
suffering
of
*NL*
peoples
,
each
epoch
of
history
brings
with
it
that
protest
of
which
it
*NL*
is
capable
.
Under
the
Caesars
,
there
was
no
insurrection
,
but
there
was
*NL*
Juvenal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
facit
indignatio
replaces
the
Gracchi
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
Caesars
,
there
is
the
exile
to
Syene
;
there
is
also
the
man
of
*NL*
the
Annales
.
We
do
not
speak
of
the
immense
exile
of
Patmos
who
,
on
his
*NL*
part
also
,
overwhelms
the
real
world
with
a
protest
in
the
name
of
the
*NL*
ideal
world
,
who
makes
of
his
vision
an
enormous
satire
and
casts
on
*NL*
Rome-Nineveh
,
on
Rome-Babylon
,
on
Rome-Sodom
,
the
flaming
reflection
of
*NL*
the
Apocalypse
.
John
on
his
rock
is
the
sphinx
on
its
pedestal
;
we
may
*NL*
understand
him
,
he
is
a
Jew
,
and
it
is
Hebrew
;
but
the
man
who
writes
*NL*
the
Annales
is
of
the
Latin
race
,
let
us
rather
say
he
is
a
Roman
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
Neros
reign
in
a
black
way
,
they
should
be
painted
to
match
.
The
*NL*
work
of
the
graving-tool
alone
would
be
too
pale
;
there
must
be
poured
*NL*
into
the
channel
a
concentrated
prose
which
bites
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despots
count
for
something
in
the
question
of
philosophers
.
A
word
that
*NL*
is
chained
is
a
terrible
word
.
The
writer
doubles
and
trebles
his
style
*NL*
when
silence
is
imposed
on
a
nation
by
its
master
.
From
this
silence
*NL*
there
arises
a
certain
mysterious
plenitude
which
filters
into
thought
*NL*
and
there
congeals
into
bronze
.
The
compression
of
history
produces
*NL*
conciseness
in
the
historian
.
The
granite
solidity
of
such
and
such
a
*NL*
celebrated
prose
is
nothing
but
the
accumulation
effected
by
the
tyrant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tyranny
constrains
the
writer
to
conditions
of
diameter
which
are
*NL*
augmentations
of
force
.
The
Ciceronian
period
,
which
hardly
sufficed
*NL*
for
Verres
,
would
be
blunted
on
Caligula
.
The
less
spread
of
sail
in
*NL*
the
phrase
,
the
more
intensity
in
the
blow
.
Tacitus
thinks
with
all
his
*NL*
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
honesty
of
a
great
heart
,
condensed
in
justice
and
truth
,
overwhelms
*NL*
as
with
lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Be
it
remarked
,
in
passing
,
that
Tacitus
is
not
historically
superposed
*NL*
upon
Caesar
.
The
Tiberii
were
reserved
for
him
.
Caesar
and
Tacitus
*NL*
are
two
successive
phenomena
,
a
meeting
between
whom
seems
to
be
*NL*
mysteriously
avoided
,
by
the
One
who
,
when
He
sets
the
centuries
on
the
*NL*
stage
,
regulates
the
entrances
and
the
exits
.
Caesar
is
great
,
Tacitus
*NL*
is
great
;
God
spares
these
two
greatnesses
by
not
allowing
them
to
clash
*NL*
with
one
another
.
The
guardian
of
justice
,
in
striking
Caesar
,
might
*NL*
strike
too
hard
and
be
unjust
.
God
does
not
will
it
.
The
great
wars
*NL*
of
Africa
and
Spain
,
the
pirates
of
Sicily
destroyed
,
civilization
*NL*
introduced
into
Gaul
,
into
Britanny
,
into
Germany
,
--
all
this
glory
*NL*
covers
the
Rubicon
.
There
is
here
a
sort
of
delicacy
of
the
divine
*NL*
justice
,
hesitating
to
let
loose
upon
the
illustrious
usurper
the
*NL*
formidable
historian
,
sparing
Caesar
Tacitus
,
and
according
extenuating
*NL*
circumstances
to
genius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
despotism
remains
despotism
,
even
under
the
despot
of
genius
.
*NL*
There
is
corruption
under
all
illustrious
tyrants
,
but
the
moral
pest
is
*NL*
still
more
hideous
under
infamous
tyrants
.
In
such
reigns
,
nothing
veils
*NL*
the
shame
;
and
those
who
make
examples
,
Tacitus
as
well
as
Juvenal
,
*NL*
slap
this
ignominy
which
can
not
reply
,
in
the
face
,
more
usefully
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
all
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rome
smells
worse
under
Vitellius
than
under
Sylla
.
Under
Claudius
and
*NL*
under
Domitian
,
there
is
a
deformity
of
baseness
corresponding
to
the
*NL*
repulsiveness
of
the
tyrant
.
The
villainy
of
slaves
is
a
direct
product
*NL*
of
the
despot
;
a
miasma
exhales
from
these
cowering
consciences
wherein
*NL*
the
master
is
reflected
;
public
powers
are
unclean
;
hearts
are
small
;
*NL*
consciences
are
dull
,
souls
are
like
vermin
;
thus
it
is
under
Caracalla
,
*NL*
thus
it
is
under
Commodus
,
thus
it
is
under
Heliogabalus
,
while
,
from
*NL*
the
Roman
Senate
,
under
Caesar
,
there
comes
nothing
but
the
odor
of
the
*NL*
dung
which
is
peculiar
to
the
eyries
of
the
eagles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
the
advent
,
apparently
tardy
,
of
the
Tacituses
and
the
Juvenals
;
*NL*
it
is
in
the
hour
for
evidence
,
that
the
demonstrator
makes
his
*NL*
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Juvenal
and
Tacitus
,
like
Isaiah
in
Biblical
times
,
like
Dante
in
*NL*
the
Middle
Ages
,
is
man
;
riot
and
insurrection
are
the
multitude
,
which
*NL*
is
sometimes
right
and
sometimes
wrong
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
majority
of
cases
,
riot
proceeds
from
a
material
fact
;
*NL*
insurrection
is
always
a
moral
phenomenon
.
Riot
is
Masaniello
;
*NL*
insurrection
,
Spartacus
.
Insurrection
borders
on
mind
,
riot
on
the
*NL*
stomach
;
Gaster
grows
irritated
;
but
Gaster
,
assuredly
,
is
not
always
in
*NL*
the
wrong
.
In
questions
of
famine
,
riot
,
Buzancais
,
for
example
,
holds
a
*NL*
true
,
pathetic
,
and
just
point
of
departure
.
Nevertheless
,
it
remains
*NL*
a
riot
.
Why
?
It
is
because
,
right
at
bottom
,
it
was
wrong
in
form
.
Shy
*NL*
although
in
the
right
,
violent
although
strong
,
it
struck
at
random
;
it
*NL*
walked
like
a
blind
elephant
;
it
left
behind
it
the
corpses
of
old
*NL*
men
,
of
women
,
and
of
children
;
it
wished
the
blood
of
inoffensive
and
*NL*
innocent
persons
without
knowing
why
.
The
nourishment
of
the
people
is
a
*NL*
good
object
;
to
massacre
them
is
a
bad
means
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
armed
protests
,
even
the
most
legitimate
,
even
that
of
the
10th
of
*NL*
August
,
even
that
of
July
14th
,
begin
with
the
same
troubles
.
Before
*NL*
the
right
gets
set
free
,
there
is
foam
and
tumult
.
In
the
beginning
,
the
*NL*
insurrection
is
a
riot
,
just
as
a
river
is
a
torrent
.
Ordinarily
it
ends
*NL*
in
that
ocean
:
revolution
.
Sometimes
,
however
,
coming
from
those
lofty
*NL*
mountains
which
dominate
the
moral
horizon
,
justice
,
wisdom
,
reason
,
*NL*
right
,
formed
of
the
pure
snow
of
the
ideal
,
after
a
long
fall
from
*NL*
rock
to
rock
,
after
having
reflected
the
sky
in
its
transparency
and
*NL*
increased
by
a
hundred
affluents
in
the
majestic
mien
of
triumph
,
*NL*
insurrection
is
suddenly
lost
in
some
quagmire
,
as
the
Rhine
is
in
a
*NL*
swamp
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
is
of
the
past
,
the
future
is
another
thing
.
Universal
suffrage
*NL*
has
this
admirable
property
,
that
it
dissolves
riot
in
its
inception
,
*NL*
and
,
by
giving
the
vote
to
insurrection
,
it
deprives
it
of
its
arms
.
*NL*
The
disappearance
of
wars
,
of
street
wars
as
well
as
of
wars
on
the
*NL*
frontiers
,
such
is
the
inevitable
progression
.
Whatever
To-day
may
be
,
*NL*
To-morrow
will
be
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
insurrection
,
riot
,
and
points
of
difference
between
the
former
*NL*
and
the
latter
,
--
the
bourgeois
,
properly
speaking
,
knows
nothing
of
such
*NL*
shades
.
In
his
mind
,
all
is
sedition
,
rebellion
pure
and
simple
,
the
*NL*
revolt
of
the
dog
against
his
master
,
an
attempt
to
bite
whom
must
be
*NL*
punished
by
the
chain
and
the
kennel
,
barking
,
snapping
,
until
such
day
*NL*
as
the
head
of
the
dog
,
suddenly
enlarged
,
is
outlined
vaguely
in
the
*NL*
gloom
face
to
face
with
the
lion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
bourgeois
shouts
:
``
Long
live
the
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
explanation
given
,
what
does
the
movement
of
June
,
1832
,
signify
,
*NL*
so
far
as
history
is
concerned
?
Is
it
a
revolt
?
Is
it
an
insurrection
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
happen
to
us
,
in
placing
this
formidable
event
on
the
stage
,
to
*NL*
say
revolt
now
and
then
,
but
merely
to
distinguish
superficial
facts
,
*NL*
and
always
preserving
the
distinction
between
revolt
,
the
form
,
and
*NL*
insurrection
,
the
foundation
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
movement
of
1832
had
,
in
its
rapid
outbreak
and
in
its
melancholy
*NL*
extinction
,
so
much
grandeur
,
that
even
those
who
see
in
it
only
an
*NL*
uprising
,
never
refer
to
it
otherwise
than
with
respect
.
For
them
,
it
*NL*
is
like
a
relic
of
1830
.
Excited
imaginations
,
say
they
,
are
not
to
be
*NL*
calmed
in
a
day
.
A
revolution
can
not
be
cut
off
short
.
It
must
needs
*NL*
undergo
some
undulations
before
it
returns
to
a
state
of
rest
,
like
a
*NL*
mountain
sinking
into
the
plain
.
There
are
no
Alps
without
their
Jura
,
*NL*
nor
Pyrenees
without
the
Asturias
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pathetic
crisis
of
contemporary
history
which
the
memory
of
*NL*
Parisians
calls
``
the
epoch
of
the
riots
,
''
is
certainly
a
characteristic
*NL*
hour
amid
the
stormy
hours
of
this
century
.
A
last
word
,
before
we
enter
*NL*
on
the
recital
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
facts
which
we
are
about
to
relate
belong
to
that
dramatic
and
*NL*
living
reality
,
which
the
historian
sometimes
neglects
for
lack
of
time
*NL*
and
space
.
There
,
nevertheless
,
we
insist
upon
it
,
is
life
,
palpitation
,
*NL*
human
tremor
.
Petty
details
,
as
we
think
we
have
already
said
,
are
,
so
*NL*
to
speak
,
the
foliage
of
great
events
,
and
are
lost
in
the
distance
of
*NL*
history
.
The
epoch
,
surnamed
``
of
the
riots
,
''
abounds
in
details
of
*NL*
this
nature
.
Judicial
inquiries
have
not
revealed
,
and
perhaps
have
not
*NL*
sounded
the
depths
,
for
another
reason
than
history
.
We
shall
therefore
*NL*
bring
to
light
,
among
the
known
and
published
peculiarities
,
things
*NL*
which
have
not
heretofore
been
known
,
about
facts
over
which
have
passed
*NL*
the
forgetfulness
of
some
,
and
the
death
of
others
.
The
majority
of
the
*NL*
actors
in
these
gigantic
scenes
have
disappeared
;
beginning
with
the
*NL*
very
next
day
they
held
their
peace
;
but
of
what
we
shall
relate
,
we
*NL*
shall
be
able
to
say
:
``
We
have
seen
this
.
''
We
alter
a
few
names
,
for
*NL*
history
relates
and
does
not
inform
against
,
but
the
deed
which
we
shall
*NL*
paint
will
be
genuine
.
In
accordance
with
the
conditions
of
the
book
*NL*
which
we
are
now
writing
,
we
shall
show
only
one
side
and
one
episode
,
*NL*
and
certainly
,
the
least
known
at
that
,
of
the
two
days
,
the
5th
and
the
*NL*
6th
of
June
,
1832
,
but
we
shall
do
it
in
such
wise
that
the
reader
may
*NL*
catch
a
glimpse
,
beneath
the
gloomy
veil
which
we
are
about
to
lift
,
of
*NL*
the
real
form
of
this
frightful
public
adventure
.

CHAPTER
III
--
A
BURIAL
;
AN
OCCASION
TO
BE
BORN
AGAIN
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
spring
of
1832
,
although
the
cholera
had
been
chilling
all
*NL*
minds
for
the
last
three
months
and
had
cast
over
their
agitation
an
*NL*
indescribable
and
gloomy
pacification
,
Paris
had
already
long
been
ripe
*NL*
for
commotion
.
As
we
have
said
,
the
great
city
resembles
a
piece
of
*NL*
artillery
;
when
it
is
loaded
,
it
suffices
for
a
spark
to
fall
,
and
the
*NL*
shot
is
discharged
.
In
June
,
1832
,
the
spark
was
the
death
of
General
*NL*
Lamarque
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lamarque
was
a
man
of
renown
and
of
action
.
He
had
had
in
succession
,
*NL*
under
the
Empire
and
under
the
Restoration
,
the
sorts
of
bravery
*NL*
requisite
for
the
two
epochs
,
the
bravery
of
the
battle-field
and
the
*NL*
bravery
of
the
tribune
.
He
was
as
eloquent
as
he
had
been
valiant
;
a
*NL*
sword
was
discernible
in
his
speech
.
Like
Foy
,
his
predecessor
,
after
*NL*
upholding
the
command
,
he
upheld
liberty
;
he
sat
between
the
left
and
*NL*
the
extreme
left
,
beloved
of
the
people
because
he
accepted
the
chances
*NL*
of
the
future
,
beloved
of
the
populace
because
he
had
served
the
*NL*
Emperor
well
;
he
was
,
in
company
with
Comtes
Gerard
and
Drouet
,
one
*NL*
of
Napoleon
's
marshals
in
petto
.
The
treaties
of
1815
removed
him
as
*NL*
a
personal
offence
.
He
hated
Wellington
with
a
downright
hatred
which
*NL*
pleased
the
multitude
;
and
,
for
seventeen
years
,
he
majestically
*NL*
preserved
the
sadness
of
Waterloo
,
paying
hardly
any
attention
to
*NL*
intervening
events
.
In
his
death
agony
,
at
his
last
hour
,
he
clasped
to
*NL*
his
breast
a
sword
which
had
been
presented
to
him
by
the
officers
of
*NL*
the
Hundred
Days
.
Napoleon
had
died
uttering
the
word
army
,
Lamarque
*NL*
uttering
the
word
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
death
,
which
was
expected
,
was
dreaded
by
the
people
as
a
loss
,
and
*NL*
by
the
government
as
an
occasion
.
This
death
was
an
affliction
.
Like
*NL*
everything
that
is
bitter
,
affliction
may
turn
to
revolt
.
This
is
what
*NL*
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
preceding
evening
,
and
on
the
morning
of
the
5th
of
June
,
the
day
*NL*
appointed
for
Lamarque
's
burial
,
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
,
which
the
*NL*
procession
was
to
touch
at
,
assumed
a
formidable
aspect
.
This
tumultuous
*NL*
network
of
streets
was
filled
with
rumors
.
They
armed
themselves
as
best
*NL*
they
might
.
Joiners
carried
off
door-weights
of
their
establishment
*NL*
``
to
break
down
doors
.
''
One
of
them
had
made
himself
a
dagger
of
a
*NL*
stocking-weaver
's
hook
by
breaking
off
the
hook
and
sharpening
the
*NL*
stump
.
Another
,
who
was
in
a
fever
``
to
attack
,
''
slept
wholly
dressed
*NL*
for
three
days
.
A
carpenter
named
Lombier
met
a
comrade
,
who
asked
him
:
*NL*
``
Whither
are
you
going
?
''
``
Eh
!
well
,
I
have
no
weapons
.
''
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
my
timber-yard
to
get
my
compasses
.
''
``
What
for
?
''
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
,
''
said
Lombier
.
A
certain
Jacqueline
,
an
expeditious
man
,
accosted
*NL*
some
passing
artisans
:
``
Come
here
,
you
!
''
He
treated
them
to
ten
sous
'
*NL*
worth
of
wine
and
said
:
``
Have
you
work
?
''
``
No
.
''
``
Go
to
Filspierre
,
*NL*
between
the
Barriere
Charonne
and
the
Barriere
Montreuil
,
and
you
will
*NL*
find
work
.
''
At
Filspierre
's
they
found
cartridges
and
arms
.
Certain
*NL*
well-known
leaders
were
going
the
rounds
,
that
is
to
say
,
running
from
*NL*
one
house
to
another
,
to
collect
their
men
.
At
Barthelemy
's
,
near
the
*NL*
Barriere
du
Trone
,
at
Capel
's
,
near
the
Petit-Chapeau
,
the
drinkers
*NL*
accosted
each
other
with
a
grave
air
.
They
were
heard
to
say
:
``
Have
you
*NL*
your
pistol
?
''
``
Under
my
blouse
.
''
``
And
you
?
''
``
Under
my
shirt
.
''
In
the
*NL*
Rue
Traversiere
,
in
front
of
the
Bland
workshop
,
and
in
the
yard
of
*NL*
the
Maison-Brulee
,
in
front
of
tool-maker
Bernier
's
,
groups
whispered
*NL*
together
.
Among
them
was
observed
a
certain
Mavot
,
who
never
remained
*NL*
more
than
a
week
in
one
shop
,
as
the
masters
always
discharged
him
*NL*
``
because
they
were
obliged
to
dispute
with
him
every
day
.
''
Mavot
was
*NL*
killed
on
the
following
day
at
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
Menilmontant
.
*NL*
Pretot
,
who
was
destined
to
perish
also
in
the
struggle
,
seconded
Mavot
,
*NL*
and
to
the
question
:
``
What
is
your
object
?
''
he
replied
:
``
Insurrection
.
''
*NL*
Workmen
assembled
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
Bercy
,
waited
for
a
*NL*
certain
Lemarin
,
the
revolutionary
agent
for
the
Faubourg
Saint-Marceau
.
*NL*
Watchwords
were
exchanged
almost
publicly
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
5th
of
June
,
accordingly
,
a
day
of
mingled
rain
and
sun
,
General
*NL*
Lamarque
's
funeral
procession
traversed
Paris
with
official
military
*NL*
pomp
,
somewhat
augmented
through
precaution
.
Two
battalions
,
with
draped
*NL*
drums
and
reversed
arms
,
ten
thousand
National
Guards
,
with
their
swords
*NL*
at
their
sides
,
escorted
the
coffin
.
The
hearse
was
drawn
by
young
men
.
*NL*
The
officers
of
the
Invalides
came
immediately
behind
it
,
bearing
laurel
*NL*
branches
.
Then
came
an
innumerable
,
strange
,
agitated
multitude
,
the
*NL*
sectionaries
of
the
Friends
of
the
People
,
the
Law
School
,
the
Medical
*NL*
School
,
refugees
of
all
nationalities
,
and
Spanish
,
Italian
,
German
,
*NL*
and
Polish
flags
,
tricolored
horizontal
banners
,
every
possible
sort
of
*NL*
banner
,
children
waving
green
boughs
,
stone-cutters
and
carpenters
who
*NL*
were
on
strike
at
the
moment
,
printers
who
were
recognizable
by
their
*NL*
paper
caps
,
marching
two
by
two
,
three
by
three
,
uttering
cries
,
nearly
*NL*
all
of
them
brandishing
sticks
,
some
brandishing
sabres
,
without
order
*NL*
and
yet
with
a
single
soul
,
now
a
tumultuous
rout
,
again
a
column
.
*NL*
Squads
chose
themselves
leaders
;
a
man
armed
with
a
pair
of
pistols
in
*NL*
full
view
,
seemed
to
pass
the
host
in
review
,
and
the
files
separated
*NL*
before
him
.
On
the
side
alleys
of
the
boulevards
,
in
the
branches
of
the
*NL*
trees
,
on
balconies
,
in
windows
,
on
the
roofs
,
swarmed
the
heads
of
men
,
*NL*
women
,
and
children
;
all
eyes
were
filled
with
anxiety
.
An
armed
throng
*NL*
was
passing
,
and
a
terrified
throng
looked
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Government
,
on
its
side
,
was
taking
observations
.
It
observed
with
*NL*
its
hand
on
its
sword
.
Four
squadrons
of
carabineers
could
be
seen
in
*NL*
the
Place
Louis
XV
.
in
their
saddles
,
with
their
trumpets
at
their
head
,
*NL*
cartridge-boxes
filled
and
muskets
loaded
,
all
in
readiness
to
march
;
*NL*
in
the
Latin
country
and
at
the
Jardin
des
Plantes
,
the
Municipal
Guard
*NL*
echelonned
from
street
to
street
;
at
the
Halle-aux-Vins
,
a
squadron
of
*NL*
dragoons
;
at
the
Greve
half
of
the
12th
Light
Infantry
,
the
other
*NL*
half
being
at
the
Bastille
;
the
6th
Dragoons
at
the
Celestins
;
and
the
*NL*
courtyard
of
the
Louvre
full
of
artillery
.
The
remainder
of
the
troops
*NL*
were
confined
to
their
barracks
,
without
reckoning
the
regiments
of
the
*NL*
environs
of
Paris
.
Power
being
uneasy
,
held
suspended
over
the
menacing
*NL*
multitude
twenty-four
thousand
soldiers
in
the
city
and
thirty
thousand
*NL*
in
the
banlieue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Divers
reports
were
in
circulation
in
the
cortege
.
Legitimist
tricks
*NL*
were
hinted
at
;
they
spoke
of
the
Duc
de
Reichstadt
,
whom
God
had
marked
*NL*
out
for
death
at
that
very
moment
when
the
populace
were
designating
*NL*
him
for
the
Empire
.
One
personage
,
whose
name
has
remained
unknown
,
*NL*
announced
that
at
a
given
hour
two
overseers
who
had
been
won
over
,
*NL*
would
throw
open
the
doors
of
a
factory
of
arms
to
the
people
.
That
*NL*
which
predominated
on
the
uncovered
brows
of
the
majority
of
those
*NL*
present
was
enthusiasm
mingled
with
dejection
.
Here
and
there
,
also
,
in
*NL*
that
multitude
given
over
to
such
violent
but
noble
emotions
,
there
were
*NL*
visible
genuine
visages
of
criminals
and
ignoble
mouths
which
said
:
``
Let
*NL*
us
plunder
!
''
There
are
certain
agitations
which
stir
up
the
bottoms
of
*NL*
marshes
and
make
clouds
of
mud
rise
through
the
water
.
A
phenomenon
to
*NL*
which
``
well
drilled
''
policemen
are
no
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
procession
proceeded
,
with
feverish
slowness
,
from
the
house
of
the
*NL*
deceased
,
by
way
of
the
boulevards
as
far
as
the
Bastille
.
It
rained
*NL*
from
time
to
time
;
the
rain
mattered
nothing
to
that
throng
.
Many
*NL*
incidents
,
the
coffin
borne
round
the
Vendome
column
,
stones
thrown
at
*NL*
the
Duc
de
Fitz-James
,
who
was
seen
on
a
balcony
with
his
hat
on
his
*NL*
head
,
the
Gallic
cock
torn
from
a
popular
flag
and
dragged
in
the
mire
,
*NL*
a
policeman
wounded
with
a
blow
from
a
sword
at
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
,
*NL*
an
officer
of
the
12th
Light
Infantry
saying
aloud
:
``
I
am
a
Republican
,
''
*NL*
the
Polytechnic
School
coming
up
unexpectedly
against
orders
to
remain
*NL*
at
home
,
the
shouts
of
:
``
Long
live
the
Polytechnique
!
Long
live
the
*NL*
Republic
!
''
marked
the
passage
of
the
funeral
train
.
At
the
Bastille
,
*NL*
long
files
of
curious
and
formidable
people
who
descended
from
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
,
effected
a
junction
with
the
procession
,
and
a
*NL*
certain
terrible
seething
began
to
agitate
the
throng
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
man
was
heard
to
say
to
another
:
``
Do
you
see
that
fellow
with
a
*NL*
red
beard
,
he
's
the
one
who
will
give
the
word
when
we
are
to
fire
.
''
It
*NL*
appears
that
this
red
beard
was
present
,
at
another
riot
,
the
Quenisset
*NL*
affair
,
entrusted
with
this
same
function
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hearse
passed
the
Bastille
,
traversed
the
small
bridge
,
and
reached
*NL*
the
esplanade
of
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
.
There
it
halted
.
The
crowd
,
*NL*
surveyed
at
that
moment
with
a
bird
`
seye
view
,
would
have
presented
the
*NL*
aspect
of
a
comet
whose
head
was
on
the
esplanade
and
whose
tail
spread
*NL*
out
over
the
Quai
Bourdon
,
covered
the
Bastille
,
and
was
prolonged
on
*NL*
the
boulevard
as
far
as
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
.
A
circle
was
traced
*NL*
around
the
hearse
.
The
vast
rout
held
their
peace
.
Lafayette
spoke
and
*NL*
bade
Lamarque
farewell
.
This
was
a
touching
and
august
instant
,
all
*NL*
heads
uncovered
,
all
hearts
beat
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
a
man
on
horseback
,
clad
in
black
,
made
his
appearance
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
the
group
with
a
red
flag
,
others
say
,
with
a
pike
*NL*
surmounted
with
a
red
liberty-cap
.
Lafayette
turned
aside
his
head
.
*NL*
Exelmans
quitted
the
procession
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
red
flag
raised
a
storm
,
and
disappeared
in
the
midst
of
it
.
From
*NL*
the
Boulevard
Bourdon
to
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
one
of
those
clamors
*NL*
which
resemble
billows
stirred
the
multitude
.
Two
prodigious
shouts
went
*NL*
up
:
``
Lamarque
to
the
Pantheon
!
--
Lafayette
to
the
Town-hall
!
''
Some
young
*NL*
men
,
amid
the
declamations
of
the
throng
,
harnessed
themselves
and
*NL*
began
to
drag
Lamarque
in
the
hearse
across
the
bridge
of
Austerlitz
and
*NL*
Lafayette
in
a
hackney-coach
along
the
Quai
Morland
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
crowd
which
surrounded
and
cheered
Lafayette
,
it
was
noticed
*NL*
that
a
German
showed
himself
named
Ludwig
Snyder
,
who
died
a
centenarian
*NL*
afterwards
,
who
had
also
been
in
the
war
of
1776
,
and
who
had
fought
at
*NL*
Trenton
under
Washington
,
and
at
Brandywine
under
Lafayette
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
the
municipal
cavalry
on
the
left
bank
had
been
set
*NL*
in
motion
,
and
came
to
bar
the
bridge
,
on
the
right
bank
the
dragoons
*NL*
emerged
from
the
Celestins
and
deployed
along
the
Quai
Morland
.
The
men
*NL*
who
were
dragging
Lafayette
suddenly
caught
sight
of
them
at
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
quay
and
shouted
:
``
The
dragoons
!
''
The
dragoons
advanced
at
a
*NL*
walk
,
in
silence
,
with
their
pistols
in
their
holsters
,
their
swords
in
*NL*
their
scabbards
,
their
guns
slung
in
their
leather
sockets
,
with
an
air
*NL*
of
gloomy
expectation
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
halted
two
hundred
paces
from
the
little
bridge
.
The
carriage
in
*NL*
which
sat
Lafayette
advanced
to
them
,
their
ranks
opened
and
allowed
it
*NL*
to
pass
,
and
then
closed
behind
it
.
At
that
moment
the
dragoons
and
the
*NL*
crowd
touched
.
The
women
fled
in
terror
.
What
took
place
during
that
*NL*
fatal
minute
?
No
one
can
say
.
It
is
the
dark
moment
when
two
clouds
come
*NL*
together
.
Some
declare
that
a
blast
of
trumpets
sounding
the
charge
was
*NL*
heard
in
the
direction
of
the
Arsenal
others
that
a
blow
from
a
dagger
*NL*
was
given
by
a
child
to
a
dragoon
.
The
fact
is
,
that
three
shots
were
*NL*
suddenly
discharged
:
the
first
killed
Cholet
,
chief
of
the
squadron
,
*NL*
the
second
killed
an
old
deaf
woman
who
was
in
the
act
of
closing
her
*NL*
window
,
the
third
singed
the
shoulder
of
an
officer
;
a
woman
screamed
:
*NL*
``
They
are
beginning
too
soon
!
''
and
all
at
once
,
a
squadron
of
dragoons
*NL*
which
had
remained
in
the
barracks
up
to
this
time
,
was
seen
to
debouch
*NL*
at
a
gallop
with
bared
swords
,
through
the
Rue
Bassompierre
and
the
*NL*
Boulevard
Bourdon
,
sweeping
all
before
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
all
is
said
,
the
tempest
is
loosed
,
stones
rain
down
,
a
fusillade
*NL*
breaks
forth
,
many
precipitate
themselves
to
the
bottom
of
the
bank
,
and
*NL*
pass
the
small
arm
of
the
Seine
,
now
filled
in
,
the
timber-yards
of
the
*NL*
Isle
Louviers
,
that
vast
citadel
ready
to
hand
,
bristle
with
combatants
,
*NL*
stakes
are
torn
up
,
pistol-shots
fired
,
a
barricade
begun
,
the
young
men
*NL*
who
are
thrust
back
pass
the
Austerlitz
bridge
with
the
hearse
at
a
run
,
*NL*
and
the
municipal
guard
,
the
carabineers
rush
up
,
the
dragoons
ply
their
*NL*
swords
,
the
crowd
disperses
in
all
directions
,
a
rumor
of
war
flies
to
*NL*
all
four
quarters
of
Paris
,
men
shout
:
``
To
arms
!
''
they
run
,
tumble
down
,
*NL*
flee
,
resist
.
Wrath
spreads
abroad
the
riot
as
wind
spreads
a
fire
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
EBULLITIONS
OF
FORMER
DAYS
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
extraordinary
than
the
first
breaking
out
of
a
riot
.
*NL*
Everything
bursts
forth
everywhere
at
once
.
Was
it
foreseen
?
Yes
.
Was
it
*NL*
prepared
?
No
.
Whence
comes
it
?
From
the
pavements
.
Whence
falls
it
?
From
*NL*
the
clouds
.
Here
insurrection
assumes
the
character
of
a
plot
;
there
*NL*
of
an
improvisation
.
The
first
comer
seizes
a
current
of
the
throng
*NL*
and
leads
it
whither
he
wills
.
A
beginning
full
of
terror
,
in
which
is
*NL*
mingled
a
sort
of
formidable
gayety
.
First
come
clamors
,
the
shops
are
*NL*
closed
,
the
displays
of
the
merchants
disappear
;
then
come
isolated
*NL*
shots
;
people
flee
;
blows
from
gun-stocks
beat
against
portes
cocheres
,
*NL*
servants
can
be
heard
laughing
in
the
courtyards
of
houses
and
saying
:
*NL*
``
There
's
going
to
be
a
row
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
had
not
elapsed
when
this
is
what
was
taking
place
*NL*
at
twenty
different
spots
in
Paris
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Rue
Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie
,
twenty
young
men
,
bearded
and
*NL*
with
long
hair
,
entered
a
dram-shop
and
emerged
a
moment
later
,
carrying
*NL*
a
horizontal
tricolored
flag
covered
with
crape
,
and
having
at
their
*NL*
head
three
men
armed
,
one
with
a
sword
,
one
with
a
gun
,
and
the
third
*NL*
with
a
pike
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Rue
des
Nonaindieres
,
a
very
well-dressed
bourgeois
,
who
had
a
*NL*
prominent
belly
,
a
sonorous
voice
,
a
bald
head
,
a
lofty
brow
,
a
black
*NL*
beard
,
and
one
of
these
stiff
mustaches
which
will
not
lie
flat
,
offered
*NL*
cartridges
publicly
to
passers-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Rue
Saint-Pierre-Montmartre
,
men
with
bare
arms
carried
about
a
*NL*
black
flag
,
on
which
could
be
read
in
white
letters
this
inscription
:
*NL*
``
Republic
or
Death
!
''
In
the
Rue
des
Jeuneurs
,
Rue
du
Cadran
,
Rue
*NL*
Montorgueil
,
Rue
Mandar
,
groups
appeared
waving
flags
on
which
could
be
*NL*
distinguished
in
gold
letters
,
the
word
section
with
a
number
.
One
of
*NL*
these
flags
was
red
and
blue
with
an
almost
imperceptible
stripe
of
*NL*
white
between
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
pillaged
a
factory
of
small-arms
on
the
Boulevard
Saint-Martin
,
and
*NL*
three
armorers
'
shops
,
the
first
in
the
Rue
Beaubourg
,
the
second
in
the
*NL*
Rue
Michel-le-Comte
,
the
other
in
the
Rue
du
Temple
.
In
a
few
minutes
,
*NL*
the
thousand
hands
of
the
crowd
had
seized
and
carried
off
two
hundred
*NL*
and
thirty
guns
,
nearly
all
double-barrelled
,
sixty-four
swords
,
and
*NL*
eighty-three
pistols
.
In
order
to
provide
more
arms
,
one
man
took
the
*NL*
gun
,
the
other
the
bayonet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
the
Quai
de
la
Greve
,
young
men
armed
with
muskets
installed
*NL*
themselves
in
the
houses
of
some
women
for
the
purpose
of
firing
.
One
*NL*
of
them
had
a
flint-lock
.
They
rang
,
entered
,
and
set
about
making
*NL*
cartridges
.
One
of
these
women
relates
:
``
I
did
not
know
what
cartridges
*NL*
were
;
it
was
my
husband
who
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
cluster
broke
into
a
curiosity
shop
in
the
Rue
des
Vielles
*NL*
Haudriettes
,
and
seized
yataghans
and
Turkish
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
body
of
a
mason
who
had
been
killed
by
a
gun-shot
lay
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
la
Perle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
on
the
right
bank
,
the
left
bank
,
on
the
quays
,
on
the
*NL*
boulevards
,
in
the
Latin
country
,
in
the
quarter
of
the
Halles
,
panting
*NL*
men
,
artisans
,
students
,
members
of
sections
read
proclamations
and
*NL*
shouted
:
``
To
arms
!
''
broke
street
lanterns
,
unharnessed
carriages
,
*NL*
unpaved
the
streets
,
broke
in
the
doors
of
houses
,
uprooted
trees
,
*NL*
rummaged
cellars
,
rolled
out
hogsheads
,
heaped
up
paving-stones
,
rough
*NL*
slabs
,
furniture
and
planks
,
and
made
barricades
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
forced
the
bourgeois
to
assist
them
in
this
.
They
entered
the
*NL*
dwellings
of
women
,
they
forced
them
to
hand
over
the
swords
and
guns
*NL*
of
their
absent
husbands
,
and
they
wrote
on
the
door
,
with
whiting
:
``
The
*NL*
arms
have
been
delivered
''
;
some
signed
``
their
names
''
to
receipts
for
*NL*
the
guns
and
swords
and
said
:
``
Send
for
them
to-morrow
at
the
Mayor
's
*NL*
office
.
''
They
disarmed
isolated
sentinels
and
National
Guardsmen
in
*NL*
the
streets
on
their
way
to
the
Townhall
.
They
tore
the
epaulets
from
*NL*
officers
.
In
the
Rue
du
Cimitiere-Saint-Nicholas
,
an
officer
of
the
*NL*
National
Guard
,
on
being
pursued
by
a
crowd
armed
with
clubs
and
foils
,
*NL*
took
refuge
with
difficulty
in
a
house
,
whence
he
was
only
able
to
*NL*
emerge
at
nightfall
and
in
disguise
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Quartier
Saint-Jacques
,
the
students
swarmed
out
of
their
*NL*
hotels
and
ascended
the
Rue
Saint-Hyacinthe
to
the
Cafe
du
Progress
,
*NL*
or
descended
to
the
Cafe
des
Sept-Billards
,
in
the
Rue
des
Mathurins
.
*NL*
There
,
in
front
of
the
door
,
young
men
mounted
on
the
stone
*NL*
corner-posts
,
distributed
arms
.
They
plundered
the
timber-yard
in
the
*NL*
Rue
Transnonain
in
order
to
obtain
material
for
barricades
.
On
a
single
*NL*
point
the
inhabitants
resisted
,
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Sainte-Avoye
*NL*
and
the
Rue
Simon-Le-Franc
,
where
they
destroyed
the
barricade
with
*NL*
their
own
hands
.
At
a
single
point
the
insurgents
yielded
;
they
*NL*
abandoned
a
barricade
begun
in
the
Rue
de
Temple
after
having
fired
on
*NL*
a
detachment
of
the
National
Guard
,
and
fled
through
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Corderie
.
The
detachment
picked
up
in
the
barricade
a
red
flag
,
a
*NL*
package
of
cartridges
,
and
three
hundred
pistol-balls
.
The
National
*NL*
Guardsmen
tore
up
the
flag
,
and
carried
off
its
tattered
remains
on
the
*NL*
points
of
their
bayonets
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
we
are
here
relating
slowly
and
successively
took
place
*NL*
simultaneously
at
all
points
of
the
city
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
tumult
,
*NL*
like
a
mass
of
tongues
of
lightning
in
one
clap
of
thunder
.
In
less
than
*NL*
an
hour
,
twenty-seven
barricades
sprang
out
of
the
earth
in
the
quarter
*NL*
of
the
Halles
alone
.
In
the
centre
was
that
famous
house
No.
50
,
which
*NL*
was
the
fortress
of
Jeanne
and
her
six
hundred
companions
,
and
which
,
*NL*
flanked
on
the
one
hand
by
a
barricade
at
Saint-Merry
,
and
on
the
other
*NL*
by
a
barricade
of
the
Rue
Maubuee
,
commanded
three
streets
,
the
Rue
*NL*
des
Arcis
,
the
Rue
Saint-Martin
,
and
the
Rue
Aubry-le-Boucher
,
which
*NL*
it
faced
.
The
barricades
at
right
angles
fell
back
,
the
one
of
the
*NL*
Rue
Montorgueil
on
the
Grande-Truanderie
,
the
other
of
the
Rue
*NL*
Geoffroy-Langevin
on
the
Rue
Sainte-Avoye
.
Without
reckoning
innumerable
*NL*
barricades
in
twenty
other
quarters
of
Paris
,
in
the
Marais
,
at
*NL*
Mont-Sainte-Genevieve
;
one
in
the
Rue
Menilmontant
,
where
was
visible
*NL*
a
porte
cochere
torn
from
its
hinges
;
another
near
the
little
bridge
of
*NL*
the
Hotel-Dieu
made
with
an
``
ecossais
,
''
which
had
been
unharnessed
and
*NL*
overthrown
,
three
hundred
paces
from
the
Prefecture
of
Police
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
des
Menetriers
,
a
well-dressed
man
*NL*
distributed
money
to
the
workmen
.
At
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
Grenetat
,
*NL*
a
horseman
made
his
appearance
and
handed
to
the
one
who
seemed
to
be
*NL*
the
commander
of
the
barricade
what
had
the
appearance
of
a
roll
of
*NL*
silver
.
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
``
this
is
to
pay
expenses
,
wine
,
et
caetera
.
''
*NL*
A
light-haired
young
man
,
without
a
cravat
,
went
from
barricade
to
*NL*
barricade
,
carrying
pass-words
.
Another
,
with
a
naked
sword
,
a
blue
*NL*
police
cap
on
his
head
,
placed
sentinels
.
In
the
interior
,
beyond
the
*NL*
barricades
,
the
wine-shops
and
porters
'
lodges
were
converted
into
*NL*
guard-houses
.
Otherwise
the
riot
was
conducted
after
the
most
scientific
*NL*
military
tactics
.
The
narrow
,
uneven
,
sinuous
streets
,
full
of
angles
*NL*
and
turns
,
were
admirably
chosen
;
the
neighborhood
of
the
Halles
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
a
network
of
streets
more
intricate
than
a
forest
.
The
*NL*
Society
of
the
Friends
of
the
People
had
,
it
was
said
,
undertaken
to
*NL*
direct
the
insurrection
in
the
Quartier
Sainte-Avoye
.
A
man
killed
in
*NL*
the
Rue
du
Ponceau
who
was
searched
had
on
his
person
a
plan
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
had
really
undertaken
the
direction
of
the
uprising
was
a
*NL*
sort
of
strange
impetuosity
which
was
in
the
air
.
The
insurrection
*NL*
had
abruptly
built
barricades
with
one
hand
,
and
with
the
other
seized
*NL*
nearly
all
the
posts
of
the
garrison
.
In
less
than
three
hours
,
like
a
*NL*
train
of
powder
catching
fire
,
the
insurgents
had
invaded
and
occupied
,
*NL*
on
the
right
bank
,
the
Arsenal
,
the
Mayoralty
of
the
Place
Royale
,
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
Marais
,
the
Popincourt
arms
manufactory
,
la
Galiote
,
the
*NL*
Chateau-d'Eau
,
and
all
the
streets
near
the
Halles
;
on
the
left
bank
,
*NL*
the
barracks
of
the
Veterans
,
Sainte-Pelagie
,
the
Place
Maubert
,
the
*NL*
powder
magazine
of
the
Deux-Moulins
,
and
all
the
barriers
.
At
five
*NL*
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
they
were
masters
of
the
Bastille
,
of
the
*NL*
Lingerie
,
of
the
Blancs-Manteaux
;
their
scouts
had
reached
the
Place
*NL*
des
Victoires
,
and
menaced
the
Bank
,
the
Petits-Peres
barracks
,
and
the
*NL*
Post-Office
.
A
third
of
Paris
was
in
the
hands
of
the
rioters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conflict
had
been
begun
on
a
gigantic
scale
at
all
points
;
and
,
as
a
*NL*
result
of
the
disarming
domiciliary
visits
,
and
armorers
'
shops
hastily
*NL*
invaded
,
was
,
that
the
combat
which
had
begun
with
the
throwing
of
*NL*
stones
was
continued
with
gun-shots
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
six
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
the
Passage
du
Saumon
became
the
field
*NL*
of
battle
.
The
uprising
was
at
one
end
,
the
troops
were
at
the
other
.
*NL*
They
fired
from
one
gate
to
the
other
.
An
observer
,
a
dreamer
,
the
*NL*
author
of
this
book
,
who
had
gone
to
get
a
near
view
of
this
volcano
,
*NL*
found
himself
in
the
passage
between
the
two
fires
.
All
that
he
had
to
*NL*
protect
him
from
the
bullets
was
the
swell
of
the
two
half-columns
which
*NL*
separate
the
shops
;
he
remained
in
this
delicate
situation
for
nearly
*NL*
half
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
call
to
arms
was
beaten
,
the
National
Guard
armed
in
*NL*
haste
,
the
legions
emerged
from
the
Mayoralities
,
the
regiments
from
*NL*
their
barracks
.
Opposite
the
passage
de
l'Ancre
a
drummer
received
a
*NL*
blow
from
a
dagger
.
Another
,
in
the
Rue
du
Cygne
,
was
assailed
by
thirty
*NL*
young
men
who
broke
his
instrument
,
and
took
away
his
sword
.
Another
was
*NL*
killed
in
the
Rue
Grenier-Saint-Lazare
.
In
the
Rue-Michelle-Comte
,
three
*NL*
officers
fell
dead
one
after
the
other
.
Many
of
the
Municipal
Guards
,
on
*NL*
being
wounded
,
in
the
Rue
des
Lombards
,
retreated
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
the
Cour-Batave
,
a
detachment
of
National
Guards
found
a
red
*NL*
flag
bearing
the
following
inscription
:
Republican
revolution
,
No.
127
.
*NL*
Was
this
a
revolution
,
in
fact
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurrection
had
made
of
the
centre
of
Paris
a
sort
of
inextricable
,
*NL*
tortuous
,
colossal
citadel
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
the
hearth
;
there
,
evidently
,
was
the
question
.
All
the
rest
*NL*
was
nothing
but
skirmishes
.
The
proof
that
all
would
be
decided
there
*NL*
lay
in
the
fact
that
there
was
no
fighting
going
on
there
as
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
some
regiments
,
the
soldiers
were
uncertain
,
which
added
to
the
*NL*
fearful
uncertainty
of
the
crisis
.
They
recalled
the
popular
ovation
*NL*
which
had
greeted
the
neutrality
of
the
53d
of
the
Line
in
July
,
1830
.
*NL*
Two
intrepid
men
,
tried
in
great
wars
,
the
Marshal
Lobau
and
General
*NL*
Bugeaud
,
were
in
command
,
Bugeaud
under
Lobau
.
Enormous
patrols
,
*NL*
composed
of
battalions
of
the
Line
,
enclosed
in
entire
companies
of
the
*NL*
National
Guard
,
and
preceded
by
a
commissary
of
police
wearing
his
scarf
*NL*
of
office
,
went
to
reconnoitre
the
streets
in
rebellion
.
The
insurgents
,
*NL*
on
their
side
,
placed
videttes
at
the
corners
of
all
open
spaces
,
and
*NL*
audaciously
sent
their
patrols
outside
the
barricades
.
Each
side
was
*NL*
watching
the
other
.
The
Government
,
with
an
army
in
its
hand
,
hesitated
;
*NL*
the
night
was
almost
upon
them
,
and
the
Saint-Merry
tocsin
began
to
make
*NL*
itself
heard
.
The
Minister
of
War
at
that
time
,
Marshal
Soult
,
who
had
*NL*
seen
Austerlitz
,
regarded
this
with
a
gloomy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
old
sailors
,
accustomed
to
correct
manoeuvres
and
having
as
*NL*
resource
and
guide
only
tactics
,
that
compass
of
battles
,
are
utterly
*NL*
disconcerted
in
the
presence
of
that
immense
foam
which
is
called
public
*NL*
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
National
Guards
of
the
suburbs
rushed
up
in
haste
and
disorder
.
A
*NL*
battalion
of
the
12th
Light
came
at
a
run
from
Saint-Denis
,
the
14th
of
*NL*
the
Line
arrived
from
Courbevoie
,
the
batteries
of
the
Military
School
*NL*
had
taken
up
their
position
on
the
Carrousel
;
cannons
were
descending
*NL*
from
Vincennes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Solitude
was
formed
around
the
Tuileries
.
Louis
Philippe
was

CHAPTER
V
--
ORIGINALITY
OF
PARIS
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
two
years
,
as
we
have
said
,
Paris
had
witnessed
more
*NL*
than
one
insurrection
.
Nothing
is
,
generally
,
more
singularly
calm
than
*NL*
the
physiognomy
of
Paris
during
an
uprising
beyond
the
bounds
of
*NL*
the
rebellious
quarters
.
Paris
very
speedily
accustoms
herself
to
*NL*
anything
,
--
it
is
only
a
riot
,
--
and
Paris
has
so
many
affairs
on
hand
,
*NL*
that
she
does
not
put
herself
out
for
so
small
a
matter
.
These
colossal
*NL*
cities
alone
can
offer
such
spectacles
.
These
immense
enclosures
alone
*NL*
can
contain
at
the
same
time
civil
war
and
an
odd
and
indescribable
*NL*
tranquillity
.
Ordinarily
,
when
an
insurrection
commences
,
when
the
*NL*
shop-keeper
hears
the
drum
,
the
call
to
arms
,
the
general
alarm
,
he
*NL*
contents
himself
with
the
remark
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
appears
to
be
a
squabble
in
the
Rue
Saint-Martin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Or
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Often
he
adds
carelessly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
somewhere
in
that
direction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
,
when
the
heart-rending
and
mournful
hubbub
of
musketry
and
*NL*
firing
by
platoons
becomes
audible
,
the
shopkeeper
says
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
getting
hot
!
Hullo
,
it
's
getting
hot
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
the
riot
approaches
and
gains
in
force
,
he
shuts
up
his
*NL*
shop
precipitately
,
hastily
dons
his
uniform
,
that
is
to
say
,
he
places
*NL*
his
merchandise
in
safety
and
risks
his
own
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
fire
in
a
square
,
in
a
passage
,
in
a
blind
alley
;
they
take
and
*NL*
re-take
the
barricade
;
blood
flows
,
the
grape-shot
riddles
the
fronts
*NL*
of
the
houses
,
the
balls
kill
people
in
their
beds
,
corpses
encumber
the
*NL*
streets
.
A
few
streets
away
,
the
shock
of
billiard-balls
can
be
heard
in
*NL*
the
cafes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
theatres
open
their
doors
and
present
vaudevilles
;
the
curious
laugh
*NL*
and
chat
a
couple
of
paces
distant
from
these
streets
filled
with
*NL*
war
.
Hackney-carriages
go
their
way
;
passers-by
are
going
to
a
dinner
*NL*
somewhere
in
town
.
Sometimes
in
the
very
quarter
where
the
fighting
is
*NL*
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1831
,
a
fusillade
was
stopped
to
allow
a
wedding
party
to
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
time
of
the
insurrection
of
1839
,
in
the
Rue
Saint-Martin
a
*NL*
little
,
infirm
old
man
,
pushing
a
hand-cart
surmounted
by
a
tricolored
*NL*
rag
,
in
which
he
had
carafes
filled
with
some
sort
of
liquid
,
went
and
*NL*
came
from
barricade
to
troops
and
from
troops
to
the
barricade
,
offering
*NL*
his
glasses
of
cocoa
impartially
,
--
now
to
the
Government
,
now
to
*NL*
anarchy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
can
be
stranger
;
and
this
is
the
peculiar
character
of
uprisings
*NL*
in
Paris
,
which
can
not
be
found
in
any
other
capital
.
To
this
end
,
two
*NL*
things
are
requisite
,
the
size
of
Paris
and
its
gayety
.
The
city
of
*NL*
Voltaire
and
Napoleon
is
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
occasion
,
however
,
in
the
resort
to
arms
of
June
25th
,
1832
,
the
*NL*
great
city
felt
something
which
was
,
perhaps
,
stronger
than
itself
.
It
*NL*
was
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Closed
doors
,
windows
,
and
shutters
were
to
be
seen
everywhere
,
in
the
*NL*
most
distant
and
most
``
disinterested
''
quarters
.
The
courageous
took
to
*NL*
arms
,
the
poltroons
hid
.
The
busy
and
heedless
passer-by
disappeared
.
*NL*
Many
streets
were
empty
at
four
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alarming
details
were
hawked
about
,
fatal
news
was
disseminated
,
--
that
*NL*
they
were
masters
of
the
Bank
;
--
that
there
were
six
hundred
of
them
*NL*
in
the
Cloister
of
Saint-Merry
alone
,
entrenched
and
embattled
in
the
*NL*
church
;
that
the
line
was
not
to
be
depended
on
;
that
Armand
Carrel
*NL*
had
been
to
see
Marshal
Clausel
and
that
the
Marshal
had
said
:
``
Get
a
*NL*
regiment
first
''
;
that
Lafayette
was
ill
,
but
that
he
had
said
to
them
,
*NL*
nevertheless
:
``
I
am
with
you
.
I
will
follow
you
wherever
there
is
room
*NL*
for
a
chair
''
;
that
one
must
be
on
one
's
guard
;
that
at
night
there
would
*NL*
be
people
pillaging
isolated
dwellings
in
the
deserted
corners
of
Paris
*NL*
-LRB-
there
the
imagination
of
the
police
,
that
Anne
Radcliffe
mixed
up
with
*NL*
the
Government
was
recognizable
-RRB-
;
that
a
battery
had
been
established
*NL*
in
the
Rue
Aubry
le
Boucher
;
that
Lobau
and
Bugeaud
were
putting
their
*NL*
heads
together
,
and
that
,
at
midnight
,
or
at
daybreak
at
latest
,
four
*NL*
columns
would
march
simultaneously
on
the
centre
of
the
uprising
,
the
*NL*
first
coming
from
the
Bastille
,
the
second
from
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
,
*NL*
the
third
from
the
Greve
,
the
fourth
from
the
Halles
;
that
perhaps
,
*NL*
also
,
the
troops
would
evacuate
Paris
and
withdraw
to
the
Champ-de-Mars
;
*NL*
that
no
one
knew
what
would
happen
,
but
that
this
time
,
it
certainly
was
*NL*
serious
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
busied
themselves
over
Marshal
Soult
's
hesitations
.
Why
did
not
*NL*
he
attack
at
once
?
It
is
certain
that
he
was
profoundly
absorbed
.
The
*NL*
old
lion
seemed
to
scent
an
unknown
monster
in
that
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
came
,
the
theatres
did
not
open
;
the
patrols
circulated
with
*NL*
an
air
of
irritation
;
passers-by
were
searched
;
suspicious
persons
were
*NL*
arrested
.
By
nine
o'clock
,
more
than
eight
hundred
persons
had
been
*NL*
arrested
,
the
Prefecture
of
Police
was
encumbered
with
them
,
so
was
the
*NL*
Conciergerie
,
so
was
La
Force
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Conciergerie
in
particular
,
the
long
vault
which
is
called
the
*NL*
Rue
de
Paris
was
littered
with
trusses
of
straw
upon
which
lay
a
heap
*NL*
of
prisoners
,
whom
the
man
of
Lyons
,
Lagrange
,
harangued
valiantly
.
*NL*
All
that
straw
rustled
by
all
these
men
,
produced
the
sound
of
a
heavy
*NL*
shower
.
Elsewhere
prisoners
slept
in
the
open
air
in
the
meadows
,
piled
*NL*
on
top
of
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxiety
reigned
everywhere
,
and
a
certain
tremor
which
was
not
habitual
*NL*
with
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
barricaded
themselves
in
their
houses
;
wives
and
mothers
were
*NL*
uneasy
;
nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
this
:
``
Ah
!
my
God
!
He
has
not
come
*NL*
home
!
''
There
was
hardly
even
the
distant
rumble
of
a
vehicle
to
be
*NL*
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
listened
on
their
thresholds
,
to
the
rumors
,
the
shouts
,
the
*NL*
tumult
,
the
dull
and
indistinct
sounds
,
to
the
things
that
were
*NL*
said
:
``
It
is
cavalry
,
''
or
:
``
Those
are
the
caissons
galloping
,
''
to
the
*NL*
trumpets
,
the
drums
,
the
firing
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
that
lamentable
*NL*
alarm
peal
from
Saint-Merry
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
for
the
first
cannon-shot
.
Men
sprang
up
at
the
corners
of
*NL*
the
streets
and
disappeared
,
shouting
:
``
Go
home
!
''
And
people
made
haste
*NL*
to
bolt
their
doors
.
They
said
:
``
How
will
all
this
end
?
''
From
moment
to
*NL*
moment
,
in
proportion
as
the
darkness
descended
,
Paris
seemed
to
take
on
*NL*
a
more
mournful
hue
from
the
formidable
flaming
of
the
revolt
.

WITH

THE
ORIGIN
OF
GAVROCHE
'S
*NL*
POETRY
.
THE
INFLUENCE
OF
AN
ACADEMICIAN
ON
THIS
POETRY
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
instant
when
the
insurrection
,
arising
from
the
shock
of
the
*NL*
populace
and
the
military
in
front
of
the
Arsenal
,
started
a
movement
*NL*
in
advance
and
towards
the
rear
in
the
multitude
which
was
following
the
*NL*
hearse
and
which
,
through
the
whole
length
of
the
boulevards
,
weighed
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
,
on
the
head
of
the
procession
,
there
arose
a
frightful
ebb
.
*NL*
The
rout
was
shaken
,
their
ranks
were
broken
,
all
ran
,
fled
,
made
their
*NL*
escape
,
some
with
shouts
of
attack
,
others
with
the
pallor
of
flight
.
*NL*
The
great
river
which
covered
the
boulevards
divided
in
a
twinkling
,
*NL*
overflowed
to
right
and
left
,
and
spread
in
torrents
over
two
hundred
*NL*
streets
at
once
with
the
roar
of
a
sewer
that
has
broken
loose
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
ragged
child
who
was
coming
down
through
the
Rue
*NL*
Menilmontant
,
holding
in
his
hand
a
branch
of
blossoming
laburnum
which
*NL*
he
had
just
plucked
on
the
heights
of
Belleville
,
caught
sight
of
an
old
*NL*
holster-pistol
in
the
show-window
of
a
bric-a-brac
merchant
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
What
's
-
your-name
,
I
'm
going
to
borrow
your
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
off
he
ran
with
the
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
minutes
later
,
a
flood
of
frightened
bourgeois
who
were
fleeing
*NL*
through
the
Rue
Amelot
and
the
Rue
Basse
,
encountered
the
lad
*NL*
brandishing
his
pistol
and
singing

way
to
the
wars
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
boulevard
he
noticed
that
the
pistol
had
no
trigger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
the
author
of
that
couplet
which
served
to
punctuate
his
march
,
*NL*
and
of
all
the
other
songs
which
he
was
fond
of
singing
on
occasion
?
We
*NL*
know
not
.
Who
does
know
?
Himself
,
perhaps
.
However
,
Gavroche
was
well
*NL*
up
in
all
the
popular
tunes
in
circulation
,
and
he
mingled
with
them
his
*NL*
own
chirpings
.
An
observing
urchin
and
a
rogue
,
he
made
a
potpourri
of
*NL*
the
voices
of
nature
and
the
voices
of
Paris
.
He
combined
the
repertory
*NL*
of
the
birds
with
the
repertory
of
the
workshops
.
He
was
acquainted
with
*NL*
thieves
,
a
tribe
contiguous
to
his
own
.
He
had
,
it
appears
,
been
*NL*
for
three
months
apprenticed
to
a
printer
.
He
had
one
day
executed
a
*NL*
commission
for
M.
Baour-Lormian
,
one
of
the
Forty
.
Gavroche
was
a
gamin
*NL*
of
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Gavroche
had
no
suspicion
of
the
fact
that
when
he
had
offered
*NL*
the
hospitality
of
his
elephant
to
two
brats
on
that
villainously
*NL*
rainy
night
,
it
was
to
his
own
brothers
that
he
had
played
the
part
of
*NL*
Providence
.
His
brothers
in
the
evening
,
his
father
in
the
morning
;
*NL*
that
is
what
his
night
had
been
like
.
On
quitting
the
Rue
des
Ballets
*NL*
at
daybreak
,
he
had
returned
in
haste
to
the
elephant
,
had
artistically
*NL*
extracted
from
it
the
two
brats
,
had
shared
with
them
some
sort
of
*NL*
breakfast
which
he
had
invented
,
and
had
then
gone
away
,
confiding
*NL*
them
to
that
good
mother
,
the
street
,
who
had
brought
him
up
,
almost
*NL*
entirely
.
On
leaving
them
,
he
had
appointed
to
meet
them
at
the
same
*NL*
spot
in
the
evening
,
and
had
left
them
this
discourse
by
way
of
a
*NL*
farewell
:
``
I
break
a
cane
,
otherwise
expressed
,
I
cut
my
stick
,
or
,
as
*NL*
they
say
at
the
court
,
I
file
off
.
If
you
do
n't
find
papa
and
mamma
,
*NL*
young
`
uns
,
come
back
here
this
evening
.
I
'll
scramble
you
up
some
*NL*
supper
,
and
I
'll
give
you
a
shakedown
.
''
The
two
children
,
picked
up
by
*NL*
some
policeman
and
placed
in
the
refuge
,
or
stolen
by
some
mountebank
,
*NL*
or
having
simply
strayed
off
in
that
immense
Chinese
puzzle
of
a
Paris
,
*NL*
did
not
return
.
The
lowest
depths
of
the
actual
social
world
are
full
of
*NL*
these
lost
traces
.
Gavroche
did
not
see
them
again
.
Ten
or
twelve
weeks
*NL*
had
elapsed
since
that
night
.
More
than
once
he
had
scratched
the
back
*NL*
of
his
head
and
said
:
``
Where
the
devil
are
my
two
children
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
he
had
arrived
,
pistol
in
hand
,
in
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Pont-aux-Choux
.
He
noticed
that
there
was
but
one
shop
open
in
that
*NL*
street
,
and
,
a
matter
worthy
of
reflection
,
that
was
a
pastry-cook
's
*NL*
shop
.
This
presented
a
providential
occasion
to
eat
another
*NL*
apple-turnover
before
entering
the
unknown
.
Gavroche
halted
,
fumbled
in
*NL*
his
fob
,
turned
his
pocket
inside
out
,
found
nothing
,
not
even
a
sou
,
*NL*
and
began
to
shout
:
``
Help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
hard
to
miss
the
last
cake
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Gavroche
pursued
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
minutes
later
he
was
in
the
Rue
Saint-Louis
.
While
traversing
the
*NL*
Rue
du
Parc-Royal
,
he
felt
called
upon
to
make
good
the
loss
of
the
*NL*
apple-turnover
which
had
been
impossible
,
and
he
indulged
himself
in
the
*NL*
immense
delight
of
tearing
down
the
theatre
posters
in
broad
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
further
on
,
on
catching
sight
of
a
group
of
comfortable-looking
*NL*
persons
,
who
seemed
to
be
landed
proprietors
,
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
*NL*
and
spit
out
at
random
before
him
this
mouthful
of
philosophical
bile
as
*NL*
they
passed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fat
those
moneyed
men
are
!
They
're
drunk
!
They
just
wallow
in
good
*NL*
dinners
.
Ask
'em
what
they
do
with
their
money
.
They
do
n't
know
.
They
*NL*
eat
it
,
that
's
what
they
do
!
As
much
as
their
bellies
will
hold
.

CHAPTER
II
--
GAVROCHE
ON
THE
MARCH
*NL*
*NL*
The
brandishing
of
a
triggerless
pistol
,
grasped
in
one
's
hand
in
the
*NL*
open
street
,
is
so
much
of
a
public
function
that
Gavroche
felt
his
*NL*
fervor
increasing
with
every
moment
.
Amid
the
scraps
of
the
Marseillaise
*NL*
which
he
was
singing
,
he
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
goes
well
.
I
suffer
a
great
deal
in
my
left
paw
,
I
'm
all
broken
*NL*
up
with
rheumatism
,
but
I
'm
satisfied
,
citizens
.
All
that
the
bourgeois
*NL*
have
to
do
is
to
bear
themselves
well
,
I
'll
sneeze
them
out
subversive
*NL*
couplets
.
What
are
the
police
spies
?
Dogs
.
And
I
'd
just
like
to
have
*NL*
one
of
them
at
the
end
of
my
pistol
.
I
'm
just
from
the
boulevard
,
my
*NL*
friends
.
It
's
getting
hot
there
,
it
's
getting
into
a
little
boil
,
it
's
*NL*
simmering
.
It
's
time
to
skim
the
pot
.
Forward
march
,
men
!
Let
an
impure
*NL*
blood
inundate
the
furrows
!
I
give
my
days
to
my
country
,
I
shall
never
*NL*
see
my
concubine
more
,
Nini
,
finished
,
yes
,
Nini
?
But
never
mind
!
Long
*NL*
live
joy
!
Let
's
fight
,
crebleu
!
I
've
had
enough
of
despotism
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
horse
of
a
lancer
of
the
National
Guard
having
*NL*
fallen
,
Gavroche
laid
his
pistol
on
the
pavement
,
and
picked
up
the
*NL*
man
,
then
he
assisted
in
raising
the
horse
.
After
which
he
picked
up
his
*NL*
pistol
and
resumed
his
way
.
In
the
Rue
de
Thorigny
,
all
was
peace
and
*NL*
silence
.
This
apathy
,
peculiar
to
the
Marais
,
presented
a
contrast
with
*NL*
the
vast
surrounding
uproar
.
Four
gossips
were
chatting
in
a
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Scotland
has
trios
of
witches
,
Paris
has
quartettes
of
old
gossiping
*NL*
hags
;
and
the
``
Thou
shalt
be
King
''
could
be
quite
as
mournfully
hurled
*NL*
at
Bonaparte
in
the
Carrefour
Baudoyer
as
at
Macbeth
on
the
heath
of
*NL*
Armuyr
.
The
croak
would
be
almost
identical
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gossips
of
the
Rue
de
Thorigny
busied
themselves
only
with
their
own
*NL*
concerns
.
Three
of
them
were
portresses
,
and
the
fourth
was
a
rag-picker
*NL*
with
her
basket
on
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
four
of
them
seemed
to
be
standing
at
the
four
corners
of
old
age
,
*NL*
which
are
decrepitude
,
decay
,
ruin
,
and
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rag-picker
was
humble
.
In
this
open-air
society
,
it
is
the
*NL*
rag-picker
who
salutes
and
the
portress
who
patronizes
.
This
is
caused
*NL*
by
the
corner
for
refuse
,
which
is
fat
or
lean
,
according
to
the
will
of
*NL*
the
portresses
,
and
after
the
fancy
of
the
one
who
makes
the
heap
.
There
*NL*
may
be
kindness
in
the
broom
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
rag-picker
was
a
grateful
creature
,
and
she
smiled
,
with
what
a
*NL*
smile
!
on
the
three
portresses
.
Things
of
this
nature
were
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
is
your
cat
still
cross
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
gracious
,
cats
are
naturally
the
enemies
of
dogs
,
you
know
.
It
's
*NL*
the
dogs
who
complain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
people
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
fleas
from
a
cat
do
n't
go
after
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
the
trouble
,
dogs
are
dangerous
.
I
remember
one
year
*NL*
when
there
were
so
many
dogs
that
it
was
necessary
to
put
it
in
the
*NL*
newspapers
.
That
was
at
the
time
when
there
were
at
the
Tuileries
great
*NL*
sheep
that
drew
the
little
carriage
of
the
King
of
Rome
.
Do
you
remember
*NL*
the
King
of
Rome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
liked
the
Duc
de
Bordeau
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
Louis
XVIII
.
I
prefer
Louis
XVIII

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meat
is
awfully
dear
,
is
n't
it
,
Mother
Patagon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
do
n't
mention
it
,
the
butcher
's
shop
is
a
horror
.
A
horrible
*NL*
horror
--
one
ca
n't
afford
anything
but
the
poor
cuts
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
rag-picker
interposed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ladies
,
business
is
dull
.
The
refuse
heaps
are
miserable
.
No
one
throws
*NL*
anything
away

They
eat
everything

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
poorer
people
than
you

Vargouleme

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
's
true
,
''
replied
the
rag-picker
,
with
deference
,
``
I
have
a
*NL*
profession
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
succeeded
,
and
the
rag-picker
,
yielding
to
that
necessity
for
*NL*
boasting
which
lies
at
the
bottom
of
man
,
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
morning
,
on
my
return
home
,
I
pick
over
my
basket
,
I
sort
my
*NL*
things

This
makes
heaps
in
my
room

I
put
the
rags
in
a
basket
,
the
*NL*
cores
and
stalks
in
a
bucket
,
the
linen
in
my
cupboard

the
woollen
*NL*
stuff
in
my
commode

the
old
papers
in
the
corner
of
the
window

*NL*
the
things

are
good

in
my
bowl

the
bits

fireplace

the
old
shoes

my
door

and
the
bones
under
my
bed

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
had
stopped
behind
her
and
was
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
ladies
,
''
said
he
,
``
what
do
you
mean
by
talking
politics
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
assailed
by
a
broadside
,
composed
of
a
quadruple
howl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
another
rascal

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that

's
got
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
'd
like
to
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sort
of
animal
is
never
easy
unless
he
's
overturning
the
*NL*
authorities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
disdainfully
contented
himself
,
by
way
of
reprisal
,
with
*NL*
elevating
the
tip
of
his
nose
with
his
thumb
and
opening
his
hand
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rag-picker
cried
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
malicious
,
bare-pawed
little
wretch
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
one
who
answered
to
the
name
of
Patagon
clapped
her
hands
together
*NL*
in
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
going
to
be
evil
doings

that
's
certain

The
errand-boy
next
*NL*
door
has
a
little
pointed
beard
,
I
have
seen
him
pass
every
day
with
a
*NL*
young
person
in
a
pink
bonnet
on
his
arm
;
to-day
I
saw
him
pass
,
and
*NL*
he
had
a
gun
on
his
arm
.
Mame
Bacheux
says
,
that
last
week
there
was
a
*NL*
revolution
at
--
at
--
at
--
where
's
the
calf

--
at
Pontoise
.
And
then
,
there
*NL*
you
see
him
,
that
horrid
scamp
,
with
his
pistol
!
It
seems
that
the
*NL*
Celestins
are
full
of
pistols
.
What
do
you
suppose
the
Government
can
*NL*
do
with
good-for-nothings
who
do
n't
know
how
to
do
anything
but
contrive
*NL*
ways
of
upsetting
the
world
,
when
we
had
just
begun
to
get
a
little
*NL*
quiet
after
all
the
misfortunes
that
have
happened
,
good
Lord
!
to
that
*NL*
poor
queen
whom
I
saw
pass
in
the
tumbril
!
And
all
this
is
going
to
*NL*
make
tobacco
dearer
.
It
's
infamous
!
And
I
shall
certainly
go
to
see
him
*NL*
beheaded
on
the
guillotine
,
the
wretch
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
the
sniffles

old
lady

''
said
Gavroche
.
``
Blow
your
*NL*
promontory

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
passed
on
.
When
he
was
in
the
Rue
Pavee
,
the
rag-picker
occurred
*NL*
to
his
mind
,
and
he
indulged
in
this
soliloquy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
in
the
wrong
to
insult
the
revolutionists
,
Mother
*NL*
Dust-Heap-Corner

This
pistol
is
in
your
interests

It
's
so
that
you
may
*NL*
have
more
good
things
to
eat
in
your
basket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
heard
a
shout
behind
him
;
it
was
the
portress
Patagon
*NL*
who
had
followed
him
,
and
who
was
shaking
her
fist
at
him
in
the
*NL*
distance
and
crying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
nothing
but
a
bastard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Come
now

''
said
Gavroche
,
``
I
do
n't
care
a
brass
farthing
for
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
afterwards
,
he
passed
the
Hotel
Lamoignon
.
There
he
uttered
this
*NL*
appeal
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forward
march
to
the
battle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
melancholy
.
He
gazed
at
his
pistol
with
*NL*
an
air
of
reproach
which
seemed
an
attempt
to
appease
it
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
off
,
''
said
he
,
``
but
you
wo
n't
go
off

the
attention

A
very
gaunt
*NL*
poodle
came
along
at
the
moment
.
Gavroche
felt
compassion
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
doggy

said
he
,
``
you
must
have
gone

CHAPTER
III
--
JUST
INDIGNATION
OF
A
HAIR-DRESSER
*NL*
*NL*
The
worthy
hair-dresser
who
had
chased
from
his
shop
the
two
little
*NL*
fellows
to
whom
Gavroche
had
opened
the
paternal
interior
of
the
*NL*
elephant
was
at
that
moment
in
his
shop
engaged
in
shaving
an
old
*NL*
soldier
of
the
legion
who
had
served
under
the
Empire
.
They
were
*NL*
talking
.
The
hair-dresser
had
,
naturally
,
spoken
to
the
veteran
of
the
*NL*
riot
,
then
of
General
Lamarque
,
and
from
Lamarque
they
had
passed
to
*NL*
the
Emperor
.
Thence
sprang
up
a
conversation
between
barber
and
*NL*
soldier
which
Prudhomme
,
had
he
been
present
,
would
have
enriched
with
*NL*
arabesques
,
and
which
he
would
have
entitled
:
``
Dialogue
between
the
*NL*
razor
and
the
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
the
Emperor
ride
,
sir
?
''
said
the
barber
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Badly
.
He
did
not
know
how
to
fall
--
so
he
never
fell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
have
fine
horses
?
He
must
have
had
fine
horses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
day
when
he
gave
me
my
cross
,
I
noticed
his
beast
.
It
was
a
*NL*
racing
mare
,
perfectly
white
.
Her
ears
were
very
wide
apart
,
her
saddle
*NL*
deep
,
a
fine
head
marked
with
a
black
star
,
a
very
long
neck
,
strongly
*NL*
articulated
knees
,
prominent
ribs
,
oblique
shoulders
and
a
powerful
*NL*
crupper
.
A
little
more
than
fifteen
hands
in
height
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
horse
,
''
remarked
the
hair-dresser
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
His
Majesty
's
beast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hair-dresser
felt
,
that
after
this
observation
,
a
short
silence
*NL*
would
be
fitting
,
so
he
conformed
himself
to
it
,
and
then
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Emperor
was
never
wounded
but
once
,
was
he
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
soldier
replied
with
the
calm
and
sovereign
tone
of
a
man
who
*NL*
had
been
there
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
heel
.
At
Ratisbon
.
I
never
saw
him
so
well
dressed
as
on
that
*NL*
day
.
He
was
as
neat
as
a
new
sou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
,
Mr.
Veteran
,
you
must
have
been
often
wounded
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
''
said
the
soldier
,
``
ah
!
not
to
amount
to
anything
.
At
Marengo
,
I
*NL*
received
two
sabre-blows
on
the
back
of
my
neck
,
a
bullet
in
the
right
*NL*
arm
at
Austerlitz
,
another
in
the
left
hip
at
Jena
.
At
Friedland
,
*NL*
a
thrust
from
a
bayonet
,
there
,
--
at
the
Moskowa
seven
or
eight
*NL*
lance-thrusts
,
no
matter
where
,
at
Lutzen
a
splinter
of
a
shell
crushed
*NL*
one
of
my
fingers
.
Ah
!
and
then
at
Waterloo
,
a
ball
from
a
biscaien
in
*NL*
the
thigh
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fine
that
is
!
''
exclaimed
the
hair-dresser
,
in
Pindaric
accents
,
``
to
*NL*
die
on
the
field
of
battle
!
On
my
word
of
honor
,
rather
than
die
in
bed
,
*NL*
of
an
illness
,
slowly
,
a
bit
by
bit
each
day
,
with
drugs
,
cataplasms
,
*NL*
syringes
,
medicines
,
I
should
prefer
to
receive
a
cannon-ball
in
my
*NL*
belly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
over
fastidious
,
''
said
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
spoken
when
a
fearful
crash
shook
the
shop
.
The
*NL*
show-window
had
suddenly
been
fractured
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wig-maker
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
good
God
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
it
's
one
of
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cannon-ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
it
is
,
''
said
the
soldier
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
picked
up
something
that
was
rolling
about
the
floor
.
It
was
a
*NL*
pebble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hair-dresser
ran
to
the
broken
window
and
beheld
Gavroche
fleeing
*NL*
at
the
full
speed
,
towards
the
Marche
Saint-Jean
.
As
he
passed
the
*NL*
hair-dresser
's
shop
Gavroche
,
who
had
the
two
brats
still
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
had
not
been
able
to
resist
the
impulse
to
say
good
day
to
him
,
and
had
*NL*
flung
a
stone
through
his
panes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
!
''
shrieked
the
hair-dresser
,
who
from
white
had
turned
blue
,
*NL*
``
that
fellow
returns
and
does
mischief
for
the
pure
pleasure
of
it
.
What
*NL*
has
any
one
done
to
that
gamin

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
CHILD
IS
AMAZED
AT
THE
OLD
MAN
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
in
the
Marche
Saint-Jean
,
where
the
post
had
already
*NL*
been
disarmed
,
Gavroche
had
just
``
effected
a
junction
''
with
a
band
led
*NL*
by
Enjolras
,
Courfeyrac
,
Combeferre
,
and
Feuilly
.
They
were
armed
after
*NL*
a
fashion
.
Bahorel
and
Jean
Prouvaire
had
found
them
and
swelled
the
*NL*
group
.
Enjolras
had
a
double-barrelled
hunting-gun
,
Combeferre
the
gun
*NL*
of
a
National
Guard
bearing
the
number
of
his
legion
,
and
in
his
belt
,
*NL*
two
pistols
which
his
unbuttoned
coat
allowed
to
be
seen
,
Jean
Prouvaire
*NL*
an
old
cavalry
musket
,
Bahorel
a
rifle
;
Courfeyrac
was
brandishing
an
*NL*
unsheathed
sword-cane
.
Feuilly
,
with
a
naked
sword
in
his
hand
,
marched
*NL*
at
their
head
shouting
:
``
Long
live
Poland
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
the
Quai
Morland
.
Cravatless
,
hatless
,
breathless
,
soaked
*NL*
by
the
rain
,
with
lightning
in
their
eyes
.
Gavroche
accosted
them
*NL*
calmly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
we
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
Feuilly
marched
,
or
rather
bounded
,
Bahorel
,
who
was
like
a
fish
*NL*
in
water
in
a
riot
.
He
wore
a
scarlet
waistcoat
,
and
indulged
in
*NL*
the
sort
of
words
which
break
everything
.
His
waistcoat
astounded
a
*NL*
passer-by
,
who
cried
in
bewilderment
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
the
reds
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reds
,
the
reds
!
''
retorted
Bahorel
.
``
A
queer
kind
of
fear
,
*NL*
bourgeois
.
For
my
part
I
do
n't
tremble
before
a
poppy
,
the
little
red
*NL*
hat
inspires
me
with
no
alarm
.
Take
my
advice
,
bourgeois
,
let
's
leave
*NL*
fear
of
the
red
to
horned
cattle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
caught
sight
of
a
corner
of
the
wall
on
which
was
placarded
the
*NL*
most
peaceable
sheet
of
paper
in
the
world
,
a
permission
to
eat
eggs
,
a
*NL*
Lenten
admonition
addressed
by
the
Archbishop
of
Paris
to
his
``
flock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Flock
'
;
a
polite
way
of
saying
geese
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
tore
the
charge
from
the
nail
.
This
conquered
Gavroche
.
From
that
*NL*
instant
Gavroche
set
himself
to
study
Bahorel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bahorel
,
''
observed
Enjolras
,
``
you
are
wrong
.
You
should
have
let
that
*NL*
charge
alone
,
he
is
not
the
person
with
whom
we
have
to
deal
,
you
are
*NL*
wasting
your
wrath
to
no
purpose
.
Take
care
of
your
supply
.
One
does
not
*NL*
fire
out
of
the
ranks
with
the
soul
any
more
than
with
a
gun
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
one
in
his
own
fashion
,
Enjolras
,
''
retorted
Bahorel
.
``
This
*NL*
bishop
's
prose
shocks
me
;
I
want
to
eat
eggs
without
being
permitted
.
*NL*
Your
style
is
the
hot
and
cold
;
I
am
amusing
myself
.
Besides
,
I
'm
not
*NL*
wasting
myself
,
I
'm
getting
a
start
;
and
if
I
tore
down
that
charge
,
*NL*
Hercle
!
't
was
only
to
whet
my
appetite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
word
,
Hercle
,
struck
Gavroche
.
He
sought
all
occasions
for
*NL*
learning
,
and
that
tearer-down
of
posters
possessed
his
esteem
.
He
*NL*
inquired
of
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Hercle
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
cursed
name
of
a
dog
,
in
Latin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Bahorel
recognized
at
a
window
a
pale
young
man
with
a
black
beard
*NL*
who
was
watching
them
as
they
passed
,
probably
a
Friend
of
the
A
B
C
.
He
*NL*
shouted
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quick
,
cartridges
,
para
bellum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fine
man
!
that
's
true
,
''
said
Gavroche
,
who
now
understood
Latin
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tumultuous
retinue
accompanied
them
,
--
students
,
artists
,
young
men
*NL*
affiliated
to
the
Cougourde
of
Aix
,
artisans
,
longshoremen
,
armed
with
*NL*
clubs
and
bayonets
;
some
,
like
Combeferre
,
with
pistols
thrust
into
*NL*
their
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
man
,
who
appeared
to
be
extremely
aged
,
was
walking
in
the
band
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
arms
,
and
he
made
great
haste
,
so
that
he
might
not
be
left
*NL*
behind
,
although
he
had
a
thoughtful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
caught
sight
of
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keksekca
?
''
said
he
to
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
old
duffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
M.
Mabeuf
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
OLD
MAN
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
recount
what
had
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
and
his
friends
had
been
on
the
Boulevard
Bourdon
,
near
the
*NL*
public
storehouses
,
at
the
moment
when
the
dragoons
had
made
their
*NL*
charge
.
Enjolras
,
Courfeyrac
,
and
Combeferre
were
among
those
who
had
*NL*
taken
to
the
Rue
Bassompierre
,
shouting
:
``
To
the
barricades
!
''
In
the
Rue
*NL*
Lesdiguieres
they
had
met
an
old
man
walking
along
.
What
had
attracted
*NL*
their
attention
was
that
the
goodman
was
walking
in
a
zig-zag
,
as
though
*NL*
he
were
intoxicated
.
Moreover
,
he
had
his
hat
in
his
hand
,
although
it
*NL*
had
been
raining
all
the
morning
,
and
was
raining
pretty
briskly
at
the
*NL*
very
time
.
Courfeyrac
had
recognized
Father
Mabeuf
.
He
knew
him
through
*NL*
having
many
times
accompanied
Marius
as
far
as
his
door
.
As
he
was
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
peaceful
and
more
than
timid
habits
of
the
old
*NL*
beadle-book-collector
,
and
was
amazed
at
the
sight
of
him
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
that
uproar
,
a
couple
of
paces
from
the
cavalry
charges
,
almost
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
a
fusillade
,
hatless
in
the
rain
,
and
strolling
about
among
*NL*
the
bullets
,
he
had
accosted
him
,
and
the
following
dialogue
had
been
*NL*
exchanged
between
the
rioter
of
fire
and
the
octogenarian
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
M.
Mabeuf
,
go
to
your
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
going
to
be
a
row
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thrusts
with
the
sword
and
firing
,
M.
Mabeuf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Firing
from
cannon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
.
Where
are
the
rest
of
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
fling
the
government
to
the
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
had
set
out
to
follow
them
.
From
that
moment
forth
he
had
not
*NL*
uttered
a
word
.
His
step
had
suddenly
become
firm
;
artisans
had
offered
*NL*
him
their
arms
;
he
had
refused
with
a
sign
of
the
head
.
He
advanced
*NL*
nearly
to
the
front
rank
of
the
column
,
with
the
movement
of
a
man
who
*NL*
is
marching
and
the
countenance
of
a
man
who
is
sleeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fierce
old
fellow
!
''
muttered
the
students
.
The
rumor
spread
*NL*
through
the
troop
that
he
was
a
former
member
of
the
Convention
,
--
an
old
*NL*
regicide
.
The
mob
had
turned
in
through
the
Rue
de
la
Verrerie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Gavroche
marched
in
front
with
that
deafening
song
which
made
of
*NL*
him
a
sort
of
trumpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sang
:
``

CHAPTER
VI
--
RECRUITS
*NL*
*NL*
The
band
augmented
every
moment
.
Near
the
Rue
des
Billettes
,
a
man
of
*NL*
lofty
stature
,
whose
hair
was
turning
gray
,
and
whose
bold
and
daring
*NL*
mien
was
remarked
by
Courfeyrac
,
Enjolras
,
and
Combeferre
,
but
whom
*NL*
none
of
them
knew
,
joined
them
.
Gavroche
,
who
was
occupied
in
singing
,
*NL*
whistling
,
humming
,
running
on
ahead
and
pounding
on
the
shutters
of
the
*NL*
shops
with
the
butt
of
his
triggerless
pistol
;
paid
no
attention
to
this
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
chanced
that
in
the
Rue
de
la
Verrerie
,
they
passed
in
front
of
*NL*
Courfeyrac
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
happens
just
right
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
,
``
I
have
forgotten
my
purse
,
*NL*
and
I
have
lost
my
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
quitted
the
mob
and
ran
up
to
his
quarters
at
full
speed
.
He
seized
*NL*
an
old
hat
and
his
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
also
seized
a
large
square
coffer
,
of
the
dimensions
of
a
large
*NL*
valise
,
which
was
concealed
under
his
soiled
linen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
descended
again
at
a
run
,
the
portress
hailed
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
de
Courfeyrac
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
your
name
,
portress
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
portress
stood
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
know
perfectly
well
,
I
'm
the
concierge
;
my
name
is
Mother
*NL*
Veuvain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
you
call
me
Monsieur
de
Courfeyrac
again
,
I
shall
call
you
*NL*
Mother
de
Veuvain
.
Now
speak
,
what
's
the
matter
?
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
one
who
wants
to
speak
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
lodge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
devil
!
''
ejaculated
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
person
has
been
waiting
your
return
for
over
an
hour
,
''
said
the
*NL*
portress
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
a
sort
of
pale
,
thin
,
small
,
freckled
,
and
youthful
*NL*
artisan
,
clad
in
a
tattered
blouse
and
patched
trousers
of
ribbed
*NL*
velvet
,
and
who
had
rather
the
air
of
a
girl
accoutred
as
a
man
than
of
*NL*
a
man
,
emerged
from
the
lodge
and
said
to
Courfeyrac
in
a
voice
which
*NL*
was
not
the
least
in
the
world
like
a
woman
's
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Marius
,
if
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
he
return
this
evening
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Courfeyrac
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
my
part
,
I
shall
not
return
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
gazed
steadily
at
him
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
business
is
that
of
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
have
me
carry
your
coffer
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
the
barricades
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
have
me
go
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
!
''
replied
Courfeyrac
.
``
The
street
is
free
,
the
pavements
*NL*
belong
to
every
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
made
his
escape
at
a
run
to
join
his
friends
.
When
he
had
*NL*
rejoined
them
,
he
gave
the
coffer
to
one
of
them
to
carry
.
It
was
only
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
this
that
he
saw
the
young
man
,
who
had
*NL*
actually
followed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mob
does
not
go
precisely
where
it
intends
.
We
have
explained
that
*NL*
a
gust
of
wind
carries
it
away
.
They
overshot
Saint-Merry
and
found
*NL*
themselves
,
without
precisely
knowing
how
,
in
the
Rue
Saint-Denis

HISTORY
OF
CORINTHE
FROM
ITS
FOUNDATION
*NL*
*NL*
The
Parisians
who
nowadays
on
entering
on
the
Rue
Rambuteau
at
the
end
*NL*
near
the
Halles
,
notice
on
their
right
,
opposite
the
Rue
Mondetour
,
a
*NL*
basket-maker
's
shop
having
for
its
sign
a
basket
in
the
form
of
Napoleon
*NL*
the
Great
with
this
inscription
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
NAPOLEON
IS
MADE
*NL*
WHOLLY
OF
WILLOW
,
*NL*
*NL*
have
no
suspicion
of
the
terrible
scenes
which
this
very
spot
witnessed
*NL*
hardly
thirty
years
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
there
that
lay
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
which
ancient
deeds
*NL*
spell
Chanverrerie
,
and
the
celebrated
public-house
called
Corinthe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
remember
all
that
has
been
said
about
the
barricade
*NL*
effected
at
this
point
,
and
eclipsed
,
by
the
way
,
by
the
barricade
*NL*
Saint-Merry
.
It
was
on
this
famous
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Chanvrerie
,
now
fallen
into
profound
obscurity
,
that
we
are
about
to
*NL*
shed
a
little
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
we
be
permitted
to
recur
,
for
the
sake
of
clearness
in
the
recital
,
*NL*
to
the
simple
means
which
we
have
already
employed
in
the
case
of
*NL*
Waterloo
.
Persons
who
wish
to
picture
to
themselves
in
a
tolerably
exact
*NL*
manner
the
constitution
of
the
houses
which
stood
at
that
epoch
near
the
*NL*
Pointe
Saint-Eustache
,
at
the
northeast
angle
of
the
Halles
of
Paris
,
*NL*
where
to-day
lies
the
embouchure
of
the
Rue
Rambuteau
,
have
only
to
*NL*
imagine
an
N
touching
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
with
its
summit
and
the
Halles
*NL*
with
its
base
,
and
whose
two
vertical
bars
should
form
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Grande-Truanderie
,
and
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
and
whose
transverse
*NL*
bar
should
be
formed
by
the
Rue
de
la
Petite-Truanderie
.
The
old
Rue
*NL*
Mondetour
cut
the
three
strokes
of
the
N
at
the
most
crooked
angles
,
*NL*
so
that
the
labyrinthine
confusion
of
these
four
streets
sufficed
to
*NL*
form
,
on
a
space
three
fathoms
square
,
between
the
Halles
and
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Denis
on
the
one
hand
,
and
between
the
Rue
du
Cygne
and
the
Rue
*NL*
des
Precheurs
on
the
other
,
seven
islands
of
houses
,
oddly
cut
up
,
of
*NL*
varying
sizes
,
placed
crosswise
and
hap-hazard
,
and
barely
separated
,
*NL*
like
the
blocks
of
stone
in
a
dock
,
by
narrow
crannies
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
say
narrow
crannies
,
and
we
can
give
no
more
just
idea
of
those
dark
,
*NL*
contracted
,
many-angled
alleys
,
lined
with
eight-story
buildings
.
These
*NL*
buildings
were
so
decrepit
that
,
in
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
and
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Petite-Truanderie
,
the
fronts
were
shored
up
with
beams
running
*NL*
from
one
house
to
another
.
The
street
was
narrow
and
the
gutter
broad
,
*NL*
the
pedestrian
there
walked
on
a
pavement
that
was
always
wet
,
skirting
*NL*
little
stalls
resembling
cellars
,
big
posts
encircled
with
iron
hoops
,
*NL*
excessive
heaps
of
refuse
,
and
gates
armed
with
enormous
,
century-old
*NL*
gratings
.
The
Rue
Rambuteau
has
devastated
all
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
name
of
Mondetour
paints
marvellously
well
the
sinuosities
of
that
*NL*
whole
set
of
streets
.
A
little
further
on
,
they
are
found
still
better
*NL*
expressed
by
the
Rue
Pirouette
,
which
ran
into
the
Rue
Mondetour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
passer-by
who
got
entangled
from
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
la
Chanvrerie
beheld
it
gradually
close
in
before
him
as
though
he
had
*NL*
entered
an
elongated
funnel
.
At
the
end
of
this
street
,
which
was
very
*NL*
short
,
he
found
further
passage
barred
in
the
direction
of
the
Halles
*NL*
by
a
tall
row
of
houses
,
and
he
would
have
thought
himself
in
a
blind
*NL*
alley
,
had
he
not
perceived
on
the
right
and
left
two
dark
cuts
through
*NL*
which
he
could
make
his
escape
.
This
was
the
Rue
Mondetour
,
which
on
*NL*
one
side
ran
into
the
Rue
de
Precheurs
,
and
on
the
other
into
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Cygne
and
the
Petite-Truanderie
.
At
the
bottom
of
this
sort
of
*NL*
cul-de-sac
,
at
the
angle
of
the
cutting
on
the
right
,
there
was
to
be
*NL*
seen
a
house
which
was
not
so
tall
as
the
rest
,
and
which
formed
a
sort
*NL*
of
cape
in
the
street
.
It
is
in
this
house
,
of
two
stories
only
,
that
*NL*
an
illustrious
wine-shop
had
been
merrily
installed
three
hundred
years
*NL*
before
.
This
tavern
created
a
joyous
noise
in
the
very
spot
which
old
*NL*
Theophilus
described
in
the
following
couplet
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
La
branle
le
squelette
horrible
*NL*
D'un
pauvre
amant
qui
se
pendit
.
-LSB-

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
was
good
,
and
tavern-keepers
succeeded
each
other
there
,
*NL*
from
father
to
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
time
of
Mathurin
Regnier
,
this
cabaret
was
called
the
*NL*
Pot-aux-Roses
,
and
as
the
rebus
was
then
in
fashion
,
it
had
for
its
*NL*
sign-board
,
a
post
-LRB-
poteau
-RRB-
painted
rose-color
.
In
the
last
century
,
the
*NL*
worthy
Natoire
,
one
of
the
fantastic
masters
nowadays
despised
by
the
*NL*
stiff
school
,
having
got
drunk
many
times
in
this
wine-shop
at
the
*NL*
very
table
where
Regnier
had
drunk
his
fill
,
had
painted
,
by
way
of
*NL*
gratitude
,
a
bunch
of
Corinth
grapes
on
the
pink
post
.
The
keeper
of
the
*NL*
cabaret
,
in
his
joy
,
had
changed
his
device
and
had
caused
to
be
placed
*NL*
in
gilt
letters
beneath
the
bunch
these
words
:
``
At
the
Bunch
of
Corinth
*NL*
Grapes
''
-LRB-
``
Au
Raisin
de
Corinthe
''
-RRB-
.
Hence
the
name
of
Corinthe
.
Nothing
*NL*
is
more
natural
to
drunken
men
than
ellipses
.
The
ellipsis
is
the
*NL*
zig-zag
of
the
phrase
.
Corinthe
gradually
dethroned
the
Pot-aux-Roses
.
*NL*
The
last
proprietor
of
the
dynasty
,
Father
Hucheloup
,
no
longer
*NL*
acquainted
even
with
the
tradition
,
had
the
post
painted
blue
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
room
on
the
ground
floor
,
where
the
bar
was
situated
,
one
on
the
first
*NL*
floor
containing
a
billiard-table
,
a
wooden
spiral
staircase
piercing
*NL*
the
ceiling
,
wine
on
the
tables
,
smoke
on
the
walls
,
candles
in
broad
*NL*
daylight
,
--
this
was
the
style
of
this
cabaret
.
A
staircase
with
a
*NL*
trap-door
in
the
lower
room
led
to
the
cellar
.
On
the
second
floor
were
*NL*
the
lodgings
of
the
Hucheloup
family
.
They
were
reached
by
a
staircase
*NL*
which
was
a
ladder
rather
than
a
staircase
,
and
had
for
their
entrance
*NL*
only
a
private
door
in
the
large
room
on
the
first
floor
.
Under
the
*NL*
roof
,
in
two
mansard
attics
,
were
the
nests
for
the
servants
.
The
*NL*
kitchen
shared
the
ground-floor
with
the
tap-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Hucheloup
had
,
possibly
,
been
born
a
chemist
,
but
the
fact
is
*NL*
that
he
was
a
cook
;
people
did
not
confine
themselves
to
drinking
alone
*NL*
in
his
wine-shop
,
they
also
ate
there
.
Hucheloup
had
invented
a
capital
*NL*
thing
which
could
be
eaten
nowhere
but
in
his
house
,
stuffed
carps
,
*NL*
which
he
called
carpes
au
gras
.
These
were
eaten
by
the
light
of
a
*NL*
tallow
candle
or
of
a
lamp
of
the
time
of
Louis
XVI.
,
on
tables
to
which
*NL*
were
nailed
waxed
cloths
in
lieu
of
table-cloths
.
People
came
thither
*NL*
from
a
distance
.
Hucheloup
,
one
fine
morning
,
had
seen
fit
to
notify
*NL*
passers-by
of
this
``
specialty
''
;
he
had
dipped
a
brush
in
a
pot
of
black
*NL*
paint
,
and
as
he
was
an
orthographer
on
his
own
account
,
as
well
as
*NL*
a
cook
after
his
own
fashion
,
he
had
improvised
on
his
wall
this
*NL*
remarkable
inscription
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
CARPES
HO
GRAS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
winter
,
the
rain-storms
and
the
showers
had
taken
a
fancy
to
*NL*
obliterate
the
S
which
terminated
the
first
word
,
and
the
G
which
began
*NL*
the
third
;
this
is
what
remained
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
CARPE
HO
RAS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Time
and
rain
assisting
,
a
humble
gastronomical
announcement
had
become
*NL*
a
profound
piece
of
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
way
it
came
about
,
that
though
he
knew
no
French
,
Father
*NL*
Hucheloup
understood
Latin
,
that
he
had
evoked
philosophy
from
his
*NL*
kitchen
,
and
that
,
desirous
simply
of
effacing
Lent
,
he
had
equalled
*NL*
Horace
.
And
the
striking
thing
about
it
was
,
that
that
also
meant
:
*NL*
``
Enter
my
wine-shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
of
all
this
is
in
existence
now
.
The
Mondetour
labyrinth
was
*NL*
disembowelled
and
widely
opened
in
1847
,
and
probably
no
longer
exists
*NL*
at
the
present
moment
.
The
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
and
Corinthe
have
*NL*
disappeared
beneath
the
pavement
of
the
Rue
Rambuteau
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
already
said
,
Corinthe
was
the
meeting-place
if
not
the
*NL*
rallying-point
,
of
Courfeyrac
and
his
friends
.
It
was
Grantaire
who
had
*NL*
discovered
Corinthe
.
He
had
entered
it
on
account
of
the
Carpe
horas
,
*NL*
and
had
returned
thither
on
account
of
the
Carpes
au
gras
.
There
they
*NL*
drank
,
there
they
ate
,
there
they
shouted
;
they
did
not
pay
much
,
they
*NL*
paid
badly
,
they
did
not
pay
at
all
,
but
they
were
always
welcome
.
*NL*
Father
Hucheloup
was
a
jovial
host
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hucheloup
,
that
amiable
man
,
as
was
just
said
,
was
a
wine-shop-keeper
*NL*
with
a
mustache
;
an
amusing
variety
.
He
always
had
an
ill-tempered
air
,
*NL*
seemed
to
wish
to
intimidate
his
customers
,
grumbled
at
the
people
who
*NL*
entered
his
establishment
,
and
had
rather
the
mien
of
seeking
a
quarrel
*NL*
with
them
than
of
serving
them
with
soup
.
And
yet
,
we
insist
upon
*NL*
the
word
,
people
were
always
welcome
there
.
This
oddity
had
attracted
*NL*
customers
to
his
shop
,
and
brought
him
young
men
,
who
said
to
each
*NL*
other
:
``
Come
hear
Father
Hucheloup
growl
.
''
He
had
been
a
fencing-master
.
*NL*
All
of
a
sudden
,
he
would
burst
out
laughing
.
A
big
voice
,
a
good
*NL*
fellow
.
He
had
a
comic
foundation
under
a
tragic
exterior
,
he
asked
*NL*
nothing
better
than
to
frighten
you
,
very
much
like
those
snuff-boxes
*NL*
which
are
in
the
shape
of
a
pistol
.
The
detonation
makes
one
sneeze
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Hucheloup
,
his
wife
,
was
a
bearded
and
a
very
homely
creature
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
1830
,
Father
Hucheloup
died
.
With
him
disappeared
the
secret
of
*NL*
stuffed
carps
.
His
inconsolable
widow
continued
to
keep
the
wine-shop
.
*NL*
But
the
cooking
deteriorated
,
and
became
execrable
;
the
wine
,
which
had
*NL*
always
been
bad
,
became
fearfully
bad
.
Nevertheless
,
Courfeyrac
and
his
*NL*
friends
continued
to
go
to
Corinthe
,
--
out
of
pity
,
as
Bossuet
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Widow
Hucheloup
was
breathless
and
misshapen
and
given
to
rustic
*NL*
recollections
.
She
deprived
them
of
their
flatness
by
her
pronunciation
.
*NL*
She
had
a
way
of
her
own
of
saying
things
,
which
spiced
her
*NL*
reminiscences
of
the
village
and
of
her
springtime
.
It
had
formerly
been
*NL*
her
delight
,
so
she
affirmed
,
to
hear
the
loups-de-gorge
-LRB-
rouges-gorges
-RRB-
*NL*
chanter
dans
les
ogrepines
-LRB-
aubepines
-RRB-
--
to
hear
the
redbreasts
sing
in
*NL*
the
hawthorn-trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hall
on
the
first
floor
,
where
``
the
restaurant
''
was
situated
,
was
*NL*
a
large
and
long
apartment
encumbered
with
stools
,
chairs
,
benches
,
and
*NL*
tables
,
and
with
a
crippled
,
lame
,
old
billiard-table
.
It
was
reached
*NL*
by
a
spiral
staircase
which
terminated
in
the
corner
of
the
room
at
a
*NL*
square
hole
like
the
hatchway
of
a
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
room
,
lighted
by
a
single
narrow
window
,
and
by
a
lamp
that
was
*NL*
always
burning
,
had
the
air
of
a
garret
.
All
the
four-footed
furniture
*NL*
comported
itself
as
though
it
had
but
three
legs
--
the
whitewashed
walls
*NL*
had
for
their
only
ornament
the
following
quatrain
in
honor
of
Mame
*NL*
Hucheloup
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Elle
etonne
a
dix
pas
,
elle
epouvente
a
deux
,
*NL*
Une
verrue
habite
en
son
nez
hasardeux
;
*NL*
On
tremble
a
chaque
instant
qu'elle
ne
vous
la
mouche
*NL*
Et
qu'un
beau
jour
son
nez
ne
tombe
dans
sa
bouche
.

This

*NL*
*NL*
Mame
Hucheloup
,
a
good
likeness
,
went
and
came
from
morning
till
*NL*
night
before
this
quatrain
with
the
most
perfect
tranquillity
.
Two
*NL*
serving-maids
,
named
Matelote
and
Gibelotte
,
-LSB-
49
-RSB-
and
who
had
never
been
*NL*
known
by
any
other
names
,
helped
Mame
Hucheloup
to
set
on
the
tables
*NL*
the
jugs
of
poor
wine
,
and
the
various
broths
which
were
served
to
the
*NL*
hungry
patrons
in
earthenware
bowls
.
Matelote
,
large
,
plump
,
redhaired
,
*NL*
and
noisy
,
the
favorite
ex-sultana
of
the
defunct
Hucheloup
,
was
*NL*
homelier
than
any
mythological
monster
,
be
it
what
it
may
;
still
,
as
it
*NL*
becomes
the
servant
to
always
keep
in
the
rear
of
the
mistress
,
she
was
*NL*
less
homely
than
Mame
Hucheloup
.
Gibelotte
,
tall
,
delicate
,
white
with
a
*NL*
lymphatic
pallor
,
with
circles
round
her
eyes
,
and
drooping
lids
,
always
*NL*
languid
and
weary
,
afflicted
with
what
may
be
called
chronic
lassitude
,
*NL*
the
first
up
in
the
house
and
the
last
in
bed
,
waited
on
every
one
,
even
*NL*
the
other
maid
,
silently
and
gently
,
smiling
through
her
fatigue
with
a
*NL*
vague
and
sleepy
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
entering
the
restaurant
room
,
the
visitor
read
on
the
door
the
*NL*
following
line
written
there
in
chalk
by
Courfeyrac
:
--

peux
et

si
tu

CHAPTER
II
--
PRELIMINARY
GAYETIES
*NL*
*NL*
Laigle
de
Meaux
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
lived
more
with
Joly
than
*NL*
elsewhere
.
He
had
a
lodging
,
as
a
bird
has
one
on
a
branch
.
The
*NL*
two
friends
lived
together
,
ate
together
,
slept
together
.
They
had
*NL*
everything
in
common
,
even
Musichetta
,
to
some
extent
.
They
were
,
what
*NL*
the
subordinate
monks
who
accompany
monks
are
called
,
bini
.
On
the
*NL*
morning
of
the
5th
of
June
,
they
went
to
Corinthe
to
breakfast
.
Joly
,
*NL*
who
was
all
stuffed
up
,
had
a
catarrh
which
Laigle
was
beginning
to
*NL*
share
.
Laigle
's
coat
was
threadbare
,
but
Joly
was
well
dressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
nine
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
when
they
opened
the
door
of
*NL*
Corinthe
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ascended
to
the
first
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matelote
and
Gibelotte
received
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oysters
,
cheese
,
and
ham
,
''
said
Laigle
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
seated
themselves
at
a
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wine-shop
was
empty
;
there
was
no
one
there
but
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gibelotte
,
knowing
Joly
and
Laigle
,
set
a
bottle
of
wine
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
busy
with
their
first
oysters
,
a
head
appeared
at
the
*NL*
hatchway
of
the
staircase
,
and
a
voice
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
passing
by
.
I
smell
from
the
street
a
delicious
odor
of
Brie
*NL*
cheese
.
I
enter
.
''
It
was
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
took
a
stool
and
drew
up
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
Grantaire
,
Gibelotte
placed
two
bottles
of
wine
on
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
made
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
drink
those
two
bottles
?
''
Laigle
inquired
of
*NL*
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
are
ingenious
,
thou
alone
art
ingenuous
.
Two
bottles
never
yet
*NL*
astonished
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
had
begun
by
eating
,
Grantaire
began
by
drinking
.
Half
a
*NL*
bottle
was
rapidly
gulped
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
a
hole
in
your
stomach
?
''
began
Laigle
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
one
in
your
elbow
,
''
said
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
after
having
emptied
his
glass
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
Laigle
of
the
funeral
oration
,
your
coat
is
old
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
hope
so
,
''
retorted
Laigle
.
``
That
's
why
we
get
on
well
*NL*
together
,
my
coat
and
I
.
It
has
acquired
all
my
folds
,
it
does
not
bind
*NL*
me
anywhere
,
it
is
moulded
on
my
deformities
,
it
falls
in
with
all
my
*NL*
movements
,
I
am
only
conscious
of
it
because
it
keeps
me
warm
.
Old
coats
*NL*
are
just
like
old
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
ejaculated
Joly
,
striking
into
the
dialogue
,
``
an
old
goat
*NL*
is
an
old
abi
''
-LRB-
ami
,
friend
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
in
the
mouth
of
a
man
whose
head
is
stuffed
up
,
''
said
*NL*
Grantaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grantaire
,
''
demanded
Laigle
,
``
have
you
just
come
from
the
boulevard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
just
seen
the
head
of
the
procession
pass
,
Joly
and
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
marvellous
sight
,
''
said
Joly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
quiet
this
street
is
!
''
exclaimed
Laigle
.
``
Who
would
suspect
that
*NL*
Paris
was
turned
upside
down
?
How
plainly
it
is
to
be
seen
that
in
*NL*
former
days
there
were
nothing
but
convents
here
!
In
this
neighborhood
!
*NL*
Du
Breul
and
Sauval
give
a
list
of
them
,
and
so
does
the
Abbe
Lebeuf
.
*NL*
They
were
all
round
here
,
they
fairly
swarmed
,
booted
and
barefooted
,
*NL*
shaven
,
bearded
,
gray
,
black
,
white
,
Franciscans
,
Minims
,
Capuchins
,
*NL*
Carmelites
,
Little
Augustines
,
Great
Augustines
,
old
Augustines
--
there
*NL*
was
no
end
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
's
talk
of
monks
,
''
interrupted
Grantaire
,
``
it
makes
one
want
*NL*
to
scratch
one
's
self
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bouh
!
I
've
just
swallowed
a
bad
oyster
.
Now
hypochondria
is
taking
*NL*
possession
of
me
again
.
The
oysters
are
spoiled
,
the
servants
are
ugly
.
*NL*
I
hate
the
human
race
.
I
just
passed
through
the
Rue
Richelieu
,
in
front
*NL*
of
the
big
public
library
.
That
pile
of
oyster-shells
which
is
called
*NL*
a
library
is
disgusting
even
to
think
of
.
What
paper
!
What
ink
!
What
*NL*
scrawling
!
And
all
that
has
been
written
!
What
rascal
was
it
who
said
*NL*
that
man
was
a
featherless
biped
?
-LSB-
51
-RSB-
And
then
,
I
met
a
pretty
girl
of
*NL*
my
acquaintance
,
who
is
as
beautiful
as
the
spring
,
worthy
to
be
called
*NL*
Floreal
,
and
who
is
delighted
,
enraptured
,
as
happy
as
the
angels
,
*NL*
because
a
wretch
yesterday
,
a
frightful
banker
all
spotted
with
*NL*
small-pox
,
deigned
to
take
a
fancy
to
her
!
Alas
!
woman
keeps
on
the
*NL*
watch
for
a
protector
as
much
as
for
a
lover
;
cats
chase
mice
as
well
*NL*
as
birds
.
Two
months
ago
that
young
woman
was
virtuous
in
an
attic
,
she
*NL*
adjusted
little
brass
rings
in
the
eyelet-holes
of
corsets
,
what
do
*NL*
you
call
it
?
She
sewed
,
she
had
a
camp
bed
,
she
dwelt
beside
a
pot
*NL*
of
flowers
,
she
was
contented
.
Now
here
she
is
a
bankeress
.
This
*NL*
transformation
took
place
last
night
.
I
met
the
victim
this
morning
in
*NL*
high
spirits
.
The
hideous
point
about
it
is
,
that
the
jade
is
as
pretty
*NL*
to-day
as
she
was
yesterday
.
Her
financier
did
not
show
in
her
face
.
*NL*
Roses
have
this
advantage
or
disadvantage
over
women
,
that
the
traces
*NL*
left
upon
them
by
caterpillars
are
visible
.
Ah
!
there
is
no
morality
on
*NL*
earth
.
I
call
to
witness
the
myrtle
,
the
symbol
of
love
,
the
laurel
,
*NL*
the
symbol
of
air
,
the
olive
,
that
ninny
,
the
symbol
of
peace
,
the
*NL*
apple-tree
which
came
nearest
rangling
Adam
with
its
pips
,
and
the
*NL*
fig-tree
,
the
grandfather
of
petticoats
.
As
for
right
,
do
you
know
what
*NL*
right
is
?
The
Gauls
covet
Clusium
,
Rome
protects
Clusium
,
and
demands
*NL*
what
wrong
Clusium
has
done
to
them
.
Brennus
answers
:
`
The
wrong
that
*NL*
Alba
did
to
you
,
the
wrong
that
Fidenae
did
to
you
,
the
wrong
that
the
*NL*
Eques
,
the
Volsci
,
and
the
Sabines
have
done
to
you
.
They
were
your
*NL*
neighbors
.
The
Clusians
are
ours
.
We
understand
neighborliness
just
as
*NL*
you
do
.
You
have
stolen
Alba
,
we
shall
take
Clusium
.
'
Rome
said
:
`
You
*NL*
shall
not
take
Clusium
.
'
Brennus
took
Rome
.
Then
he
cried
:
`
Vae
victis
!
'
*NL*
That
is
what
right
is
.
Ah
!
what
beasts
of
prey
there
are
in
this
world
!
*NL*
What
eagles
!
It
makes
my
flesh
creep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
his
glass
to
Joly
,
who
filled
it
,
then
he
drank
and
went
on
,
*NL*
having
hardly
been
interrupted
by
this
glass
of
wine
,
of
which
no
one
,
*NL*
not
even
himself
,
had
taken
any
notice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brennus
,
who
takes
Rome
,
is
an
eagle
;
the
banker
who
takes
the
grisette
*NL*
is
an
eagle
.
There
is
no
more
modesty
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other
.
*NL*
So
we
believe
in
nothing
.
There
is
but
one
reality
:
drink
.
Whatever
your
*NL*
opinion
may
be
in
favor
of
the
lean
cock
,
like
the
Canton
of
Uri
,
or
*NL*
in
favor
of
the
fat
cock
,
like
the
Canton
of
Glaris
,
it
matters
little
,
*NL*
drink
.
You
talk
to
me
of
the
boulevard
,
of
that
procession
,
et
caetera
,
*NL*
et
caetera
.
Come
now
,
is
there
going
to
be
another
revolution
?
This
*NL*
poverty
of
means
on
the
part
of
the
good
God
astounds
me
.
He
has
to
keep
*NL*
greasing
the
groove
of
events
every
moment
.
There
is
a
hitch
,
it
wo
n't
*NL*
work
.
Quick
,
a
revolution
!
The
good
God
has
his
hands
perpetually
black
*NL*
with
that
cart-grease
.
If
I
were
in
his
place
,
I
'd
be
perfectly
simple
*NL*
about
it
,
I
would
not
wind
up
my
mechanism
every
minute
,
I
'd
lead
the
*NL*
human
race
in
a
straightforward
way
,
I
'd
weave
matters
mesh
by
mesh
,
*NL*
without
breaking
the
thread
,
I
would
have
no
provisional
arrangements
,
*NL*
I
would
have
no
extraordinary
repertory
.
What
the
rest
of
you
call
*NL*
progress
advances
by
means
of
two
motors
,
men
and
events
.
But
,
sad
to
*NL*
say
,
from
time
to
time
,
the
exceptional
becomes
necessary
.
The
ordinary
*NL*
troupe
suffices
neither
for
event
nor
for
men
:
among
men
geniuses
are
*NL*
required
,
among
events
revolutions
.
Great
accidents
are
the
law
;
the
*NL*
order
of
things
can
not
do
without
them
;
and
,
judging
from
the
apparition
*NL*
of
comets
,
one
would
be
tempted
to
think
that
Heaven
itself
finds
actors
*NL*
needed
for
its
performance
.
At
the
moment
when
one
expects
it
the
least
,
*NL*
God
placards
a
meteor
on
the
wall
of
the
firmament
.
Some
queer
star
*NL*
turns
up
,
underlined
by
an
enormous
tail
.
And
that
causes
the
death
*NL*
of
Caesar
.
Brutus
deals
him
a
blow
with
a
knife
,
and
God
a
blow
with
a
*NL*
comet
.
Crac
,
and
behold
an
aurora
borealis
,
behold
a
revolution
,
behold
*NL*
a
great
man
;
'93
in
big
letters
,
Napoleon
on
guard
,
the
comet
of
1811
*NL*
at
the
head
of
the
poster
.
Ah
!
what
a
beautiful
blue
theatre
all
studded
*NL*
with
unexpected
flashes
!
Boum
!
Boum
!
extraordinary
show
!
Raise
your
*NL*
eyes
,
boobies
.
Everything
is
in
disorder
,
the
star
as
well
as
the
drama
.
*NL*
Good
God
,
it
is
too
much
and
not
enough
.
These
resources
,
gathered
from
*NL*
exception
,
seem
magnificence
and
poverty
.
My
friends
,
Providence
has
*NL*
come
down
to
expedients
.
What
does
a
revolution
prove
?
That
God
is
in
a
*NL*
quandry
.
He
effects
a
coup
d'etat
because
he
,
God
,
has
not
been
able
to
*NL*
make
both
ends
meet
.
In
fact
,
this
confirms
me
in
my
conjectures
as
*NL*
to
Jehovah
's
fortune
;
and
when
I
see
so
much
distress
in
heaven
and
on
*NL*
earth
,
from
the
bird
who
has
not
a
grain
of
millet
to
myself
without
a
*NL*
hundred
thousand
livres
of
income
,
when
I
see
human
destiny
,
which
is
*NL*
very
badly
worn
,
and
even
royal
destiny
,
which
is
threadbare
,
witness
*NL*
the
Prince
de
Conde
hung
,
when
I
see
winter
,
which
is
nothing
but
a
rent
*NL*
in
the
zenith
through
which
the
wind
blows
,
when
I
see
so
many
rags
even
*NL*
in
the
perfectly
new
purple
of
the
morning
on
the
crests
of
hills
,
when
*NL*
I
see
the
drops
of
dew
,
those
mock
pearls
,
when
I
see
the
frost
,
that
*NL*
paste
,
when
I
see
humanity
ripped
apart
and
events
patched
up
,
and
so
*NL*
many
spots
on
the
sun
and
so
many
holes
in
the
moon
,
when
I
see
so
*NL*
much
misery
everywhere
,
I
suspect
that
God
is
not
rich
.
The
appearance
*NL*
exists
,
it
is
true
,
but
I
feel
that
he
is
hard
up
.
He
gives
a
revolution
*NL*
as
a
tradesman
whose
money-box
is
empty
gives
a
ball
.
God
must
not
be
*NL*
judged
from
appearances
.
Beneath
the
gilding
of
heaven
I
perceive
*NL*
a
poverty-stricken
universe
.
Creation
is
bankrupt
.
That
is
why
I
am
*NL*
discontented
.
Here
it
is
the
4th
of
June
,
it
is
almost
night
;
ever
since
*NL*
this
morning
I
have
been
waiting
for
daylight
to
come
;
it
has
not
come
,
*NL*
and
I
bet
that
it
wo
n't
come
all
day
.
This
is
the
inexactness
of
an
*NL*
ill-paid
clerk
.
Yes
,
everything
is
badly
arranged
,
nothing
fits
anything
*NL*
else
,
this
old
world
is
all
warped
,
I
take
my
stand
on
the
opposition
,
*NL*
everything
goes
awry
;
the
universe
is
a
tease
.
It
's
like
children
,
those
*NL*
who
want
them
have
none
,
and
those
who
do
n't
want
them
have
them
.
Total
:
*NL*
I
'm
vexed
.
Besides
,
Laigle
de
Meaux
,
that
bald-head
,
offends
my
sight
.
*NL*
It
humiliates
me
to
think
that
I
am
of
the
same
age
as
that
baldy
.
*NL*
However
,
I
criticise
,
but
I
do
not
insult
.
The
universe
is
what
it
is
.
*NL*
I
speak
here
without
evil
intent
and
to
ease
my
conscience
.
Receive
,
*NL*
Eternal
Father
,
the
assurance
of
my
distinguished
consideration
.
Ah
!
*NL*
by
all
the
saints
of
Olympus
and
by
all
the
gods
of
paradise
,
I
was
not
*NL*
intended
to
be
a
Parisian
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
rebound
forever
,
like
a
*NL*
shuttlecock
between
two
battledores
,
from
the
group
of
the
loungers
to
*NL*
the
group
of
the
roysterers
.
I
was
made
to
be
a
Turk
,
watching
oriental
*NL*
houris
all
day
long
,
executing
those
exquisite
Egyptian
dances
,
as
*NL*
sensuous
as
the
dream
of
a
chaste
man
,
or
a
Beauceron
peasant
,
or
a
*NL*
Venetian
gentleman
surrounded
by
gentlewomen
,
or
a
petty
German
prince
,
*NL*
furnishing
the
half
of
a
foot-soldier
to
the
Germanic
confederation
,
and
*NL*
occupying
his
leisure
with
drying
his
breeches
on
his
hedge
,
that
is
to
*NL*
say
,
his
frontier
.
Those
are
the
positions
for
which
I
was
born
!
Yes
,
I
*NL*
have
said
a
Turk
,
and
I
will
not
retract
.
I
do
not
understand
how
people
*NL*
can
habitually
take
Turks
in
bad
part
;
Mohammed
had
his
good
points
;
*NL*
respect
for
the
inventor
of
seraglios
with
houris
and
paradises
with
*NL*
odalisques
!
Let
us
not
insult
Mohammedanism
,
the
only
religion
which
is
*NL*
ornamented
with
a
hen-roost
!
Now
,
I
insist
on
a
drink
.
The
earth
is
a
*NL*
great
piece
of
stupidity
.
And
it
appears
that
they
are
going
to
fight
,
*NL*
all
those
imbeciles
,
and
to
break
each
other
's
profiles
and
to
massacre
*NL*
each
other
in
the
heart
of
summer
,
in
the
month
of
June
,
when
they
might
*NL*
go
off
with
a
creature
on
their
arm
,
to
breathe
the
immense
heaps
of
*NL*
new-mown
hay
in
the
meadows
!
Really
,
people
do
commit
altogether
*NL*
too
many
follies
.
An
old
broken
lantern
which
I
have
just
seen
at
a
*NL*
bric-a-brac
merchant
's
suggests
a
reflection
to
my
mind
;
it
is
time
to
*NL*
enlighten
the
human
race
.
Yes
,
behold
me
sad
again
.
That
's
what
comes
*NL*
of
swallowing
an
oyster
and
a
revolution
the
wrong
way
!
I
am
growing
*NL*
melancholy
once
more
.
Oh
!
frightful
old
world
.
People
strive
,
turn
each
*NL*
other
out
,
prostitute
themselves
,
kill
each
other
,
and
get
used
to
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Grantaire
,
after
this
fit
of
eloquence
,
had
a
fit
of
coughing
,
which
*NL*
was
well
earned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
propos
of
revolution
,
''
said
Joly
,
``
it
is
decidedly
abberent
that
*NL*
Barius
is
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does

demanded
Laigle

``

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
exclaimed
Grantaire
.
``
I
can
imagine
it
.
Marius
*NL*
is
a
fog
,
and
he
must
have
found
a
vapor

Marius

of
the

Marie

They
must
make
*NL*
a
queer
pair
of
lovers
.
I
know
just
what
it
is
like
.
Ecstasies
in
which
*NL*
they
forget
to
kiss

Pure
on
earth
,
but
joined
in
heaven

They
are
souls

possessed
of
senses

They
lie
among
the
stars

''
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
was
attacking
his
second
bottle
and
,
possibly
,
his
second
*NL*
harangue
,
when
a
new
personage
emerged
from
the
square
aperture
of
the
*NL*
stairs
.
It
was
a
boy
less
than
ten
years
of
age
,
ragged
,
very
small
,
*NL*
yellow
,
with
an
odd
phiz
,
a
vivacious
eye
,
an
enormous
amount
of
hair
*NL*
drenched
with
rain
,
and
wearing
a
contented
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
unhesitatingly
making
his
choice
among
the
three
,
addressed
*NL*
himself
to
Laigle
de
Meaux
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
Monsieur
Bossuet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is

replied
Laigle
.
``
What

want
with
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This

A
tall
blonde
fellow
on
the
boulevard
said
to
me
:

I
said
:
`
Yes

he
said

It

me
ten

*NL*
*NL*
``

,
turning
to
Grantaire
:

This
made
twenty

handed

In

engaged

half
aloud

``
Now

*NL*
*NL*
This
resolution
once
arrived
at
,
Bossuet
,
Joly
,
and
Grantaire
did
not
*NL*
stir
from
the
wine-shop
.
By
two
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
the
table
at
*NL*
which
they
sat
was
covered
with
empty
bottles
.
Two
candles
were
burning
*NL*
on
it
,
one
in
a
flat
copper
candlestick
which
was
perfectly
green
,
the
*NL*
other
in
the
neck
of
a
cracked
carafe
.
Grantaire
had
seduced
Joly
and
*NL*
Bossuet
to
wine
;
Bossuet
and
Joly
had
conducted
Grantaire
back
towards
*NL*
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Grantaire
,
he
had
got
beyond
wine
,
that
merely
moderate
*NL*
inspirer
of
dreams
,
ever
since
mid-day
.
Wine
enjoys
only
a
conventional
*NL*
popularity
with
serious
drinkers
.
There
is
,
in
fact
,
in
the
matter
*NL*
of
inebriety
,
white
magic
and
black
magic
;
wine
is
only
white
magic
.
*NL*
Grantaire
was
a
daring
drinker
of
dreams
.
The
blackness
of
a
terrible
*NL*
fit
of
drunkenness
yawning
before
him
,
far
from
arresting
him
,
attracted
*NL*
him
.
He
had
abandoned
the
bottle
and
taken
to
the
beerglass
.
The
*NL*
beer-glass
is
the
abyss
.
Having
neither
opium
nor
hashish
on
hand
,
and
*NL*
being
desirous
of
filling
his
brain
with
twilight
,
he
had
had
recourse
*NL*
to
that
fearful
mixture
of
brandy
,
stout
,
absinthe
,
which
produces
the
*NL*
most
terrible
of
lethargies
.
It
is
of
these
three
vapors
,
beer
,
brandy
,
*NL*
and
absinthe
,
that
the
lead
of
the
soul
is
composed
.
They
are
three
*NL*
grooms
;
the
celestial
butterfly
is
drowned
in
them
;
and
there
are
formed
*NL*
there
in
a
membranous
smoke
,
vaguely
condensed
into
the
wing
of
the
bat
,
*NL*
three
mute
furies
,
Nightmare
,
Night
,
and
Death
,
which
hover
about
the
*NL*
slumbering
Psyche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
had
not
yet
reached
that
lamentable
phase
;
far
from
it
.
He
was
*NL*
tremendously
gay
,
and
Bossuet
and
Joly
retorted
.
They
clinked
glasses
.
*NL*
Grantaire
added
to
the
eccentric
accentuation
of
words
and
ideas
,
*NL*
a
peculiarity
of
gesture
;
he
rested
his
left
fist
on
his
knee
with
*NL*
dignity
,
his
arm
forming
a
right
angle
,
and
,
with
cravat
untied
,
seated
*NL*
astride
a
stool
,
his
full
glass
in
his
right
hand
,
he
hurled
solemn
*NL*
words
at
the
big
maid-servant
Matelote
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
doors
of
the
palace
be
thrown
open
!
Let
every
one
be
a
member
*NL*
of
the
French
Academy
and
have
the
right
to
embrace
Madame
Hucheloup
.
*NL*
Let
us
drink
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
to
Madame
Hucheloup
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Woman
ancient
and
consecrated
by
use
,
draw
near
that
I
may
contemplate
*NL*
thee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Joly
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matelote
and
Gibelotte
,
dod
'
t
gib
Grantaire
anything
more
to
drink
.
*NL*
He
has
already
devoured
,
since
this
bording
,
in
wild
prodigality
,
two
*NL*
francs
and
ninety-five
centibes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Grantaire
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
been
unhooking
the
stars
without
my
permission
,
and
putting
*NL*
them
on
the
table
in
the
guise
of
candles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
,
though
very
drunk
,
preserved
his
equanimity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
seated
on
the
sill
of
the
open
window
,
wetting
his
back
in
the
*NL*
falling
rain
,
and
gazing
at
his
two
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
heard
a
tumult
behind
him
,
hurried
footsteps
,
cries
of
*NL*
``
To
arms
!
''
He
turned
round
and
saw
in
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
Enjolras
passing
,
gun
in
hand
,
and
Gavroche
*NL*
with
his
pistol
,
Feuilly
with
his
sword
,
Courfeyrac
with
his
sword
,
and
*NL*
Jean
Prouvaire
with
his
blunderbuss
,
Combeferre
with
his
gun
,
Bahorel
*NL*
with
his
gun
,
and
the
whole
armed
and
stormy
rabble
which
was
following
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
was
not
more
than
a
gunshot
long
.
Bossuet
*NL*
improvised
a
speaking-trumpet
from
his
two
hands
placed
around
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courfeyrac
!
Courfeyrac
!
Hohee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
heard
the
shout
,
caught
sight
of
Bossuet
,
and
advanced
a
few
*NL*
paces
into
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
shouting
:
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
which
*NL*
crossed
a
``
Where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
make
a
barricade
,
''
replied
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
here
!
This
is
a
good
place
!
Make
it
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
Aigle
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
at
a
signal
from
Courfeyrac
,
the
mob
flung
themselves
into
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Chanvrerie
.

CHAPTER
III
--
NIGHT
BEGINS
TO
DESCEND
UPON
GRANTAIRE
*NL*
*NL*
The
spot
was
,
in
fact
,
admirably
adapted
,
the
entrance
to
the
street
*NL*
widened
out
,
the
other
extremity
narrowed
together
into
a
pocket
*NL*
without
exit
.
Corinthe
created
an
obstacle
,
the
Rue
Mondetour
was
easily
*NL*
barricaded
on
the
right
and
the
left
,
no
attack
was
possible
except
*NL*
from
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
that
is
to
say
,
in
front
,
and
in
full
sight
.
*NL*
Bossuet
had
the
comprehensive
glance
of
a
fasting
Hannibal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Terror
had
seized
on
the
whole
street
at
the
irruption
of
the
mob
.
There
*NL*
was
not
a
passer-by
who
did
not
get
out
of
sight
.
In
the
space
of
a
*NL*
flash
of
lightning
,
in
the
rear
,
to
right
and
left
,
shops
,
stables
,
*NL*
area-doors
,
windows
,
blinds
,
attic
skylights
,
shutters
of
every
*NL*
description
were
closed
,
from
the
ground
floor
to
the
roof
.
A
terrified
*NL*
old
woman
fixed
a
mattress
in
front
of
her
window
on
two
clothes-poles
*NL*
for
drying
linen
,
in
order
to
deaden
the
effect
of
musketry
.
The
*NL*
wine-shop
alone
remained
open
;
and
that
for
a
very
good
reason
,
that
the
*NL*
mob
had
rushed
into
it
.
--
``
Ah
my
God
!
Ah
my
God
!
''
sighed
Mame
Hucheloup
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
had
gone
down
to
meet
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joly
,
who
had
placed
himself
at
the
window
,
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courfeyrac
,
you
ought
to
have
brought
an
umbrella
.
You
will
gatch
*NL*
gold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
,
twenty
iron
bars
had
*NL*
been
wrenched
from
the
grated
front
of
the
wine-shop
,
ten
fathoms
of
*NL*
street
had
been
unpaved
;
Gavroche
and
Bahorel
had
seized
in
its
passage
,
*NL*
and
overturned
,
the
dray
of
a
lime-dealer
named
Anceau
;
this
dray
*NL*
contained
three
barrels
of
lime
,
which
they
placed
beneath
the
piles
*NL*
of
paving-stones
:
Enjolras
raised
the
cellar
trap
,
and
all
the
widow
*NL*
Hucheloup
's
empty
casks
were
used
to
flank
the
barrels
of
lime
;
Feuilly
,
*NL*
with
his
fingers
skilled
in
painting
the
delicate
sticks
of
fans
,
had
*NL*
backed
up
the
barrels
and
the
dray
with
two
massive
heaps
of
blocks
of
*NL*
rough
stone
.
Blocks
which
were
improvised
like
the
rest
and
procured
*NL*
no
one
knows
where
.
The
beams
which
served
as
props
were
torn
from
*NL*
the
neighboring
house-fronts
and
laid
on
the
casks
.
When
Bossuet
and
*NL*
Courfeyrac
turned
round
,
half
the
street
was
already
barred
with
*NL*
a
rampart
higher
than
a
man
.
There
is
nothing
like
the
hand
of
the
*NL*
populace
for
building
everything
that
is
built
by
demolishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matelote
and
Gibelotte
had
mingled
with
the
workers
.
Gibelotte
went
and
*NL*
came
loaded
with
rubbish
.
Her
lassitude
helped
on
the
barricade
.
She
*NL*
served
the
barricade
as
she
would
have
served
wine
,
with
a
sleepy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
omnibus
with
two
white
horses
passed
the
end
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
strode
over
the
paving-stones
,
ran
to
it
,
stopped
the
driver
,
*NL*
made
the
passengers
alight
,
offered
his
hand
to
``
the
ladies
,
''
dismissed
*NL*
the
conductor
,
and
returned
,
leading
the
vehicle
and
the
horses
by
the
*NL*
bridle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Omnibuses
,
''
said
he
,
``
do
not
pass
the
Corinthe
.
Non
licet
omnibus
adire
*NL*
Corinthum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
instant
later
,
the
horses
were
unharnessed
and
went
off
at
their
*NL*
will
,
through
the
Rue
Mondetour
,
and
the
omnibus
lying
on
its
side
*NL*
completed
the
bar
across
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mame
Hucheloup
,
quite
upset
,
had
taken
refuge
in
the
first
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
vague
,
and
stared
without
seeing
anything
,
and
she
cried
*NL*
in
a
low
tone
.
Her
terrified
shrieks
did
not
dare
to
emerge
from
her
*NL*
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
end
of
the
world
has
come
,
''
she
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joly
deposited
a
kiss
on
Mame
Hucheloup
's
fat
,
red
,
wrinkled
neck
,
and
*NL*
said
to
Grantaire
:
``
My
dear
fellow
,
I
have
always
regarded
a
woman
's
*NL*
neck
as
an
infinitely
delicate
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Grantaire
attained
to
the
highest
regions
of
dithryamb
.
Matelote
*NL*
had
mounted
to
the
first
floor
once
more
,
Grantaire
seized
her
round
her
*NL*
waist
,
and
gave
vent
to
long
bursts
of
laughter
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matelote
is
homely
!
''
he
cried
:
``
Matelote
is
of
a
dream
of
ugliness
!
*NL*
Matelote
is
a
chimaera
.
This
is
the
secret
of
her
birth
:
a
Gothic
*NL*
Pygmalion
,
who
was
making
gargoyles
for
cathedrals
,
fell
in
love
with
*NL*
one
of
them
,
the
most
horrible
,
one
fine
morning
.
He
besought
Love
to
*NL*
give
it
life
,
and
this
produced
Matelote
.
Look
at
her
,
citizens
!
She
has
*NL*
chromate-of-lead-colored
hair
,
like
Titian
's
mistress
,
and
she
is
a
good
*NL*
girl
.
I
guarantee
that
she
will
fight
well
.
Every
good
girl
contains
*NL*
a
hero
.
As
for
Mother
Hucheloup
,
she
's
an
old
warrior
.
Look
at
her
*NL*
moustaches
!
She
inherited
them
from
her
husband
.
A
hussar
indeed
!
She
*NL*
will
fight
too
.
These
two
alone
will
strike
terror
to
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
banlieue
.
Comrades
,
we
shall
overthrow
the
government
as
true
as
there
*NL*
are
fifteen
intermediary
acids
between
margaric
acid
and
formic
acid
;
*NL*
however
,
that
is
a
matter
of
perfect
indifference
to
me
.
Gentlemen
,
my
*NL*
father
always
detested
me
because
I
could
not
understand
mathematics
.
*NL*
I
understand
only
love
and
liberty
.
I
am
Grantaire
,
the
good
fellow
.
*NL*
Having
never
had
any
money
,
I
never
acquired
the
habit
of
it
,
and
the
*NL*
result
is
that
I
have
never
lacked
it
;
but
,
if
I
had
been
rich
,
there
*NL*
would
have
been
no
more
poor
people
!
You
would
have
seen
!
Oh
,
if
the
*NL*
kind
hearts
only
had
fat
purses
,
how
much
better
things
would
go
!
I
*NL*
picture
myself
Jesus
Christ
with
Rothschild
's
fortune
!
How
much
good
he
*NL*
would
do
!
Matelote
,
embrace
me
!
You
are
voluptuous
and
timid
!
You
have
*NL*
cheeks
which
invite
the
kiss
of
a
sister
,
and
lips
which
claim
the
kiss
*NL*
of
a
lover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
your
tongue
,
you
cask
!
''
said
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
retorted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
the
capitoul
-LSB-
52
-RSB-
and
the
master
of
the
floral
games
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
who
was
standing
on
the
crest
of
the
barricade
,
gun
in
hand
,
*NL*
raised
his
beautiful
,
austere
face
.
Enjolras
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
had
*NL*
something
of
the
Spartan
and
of
the
Puritan
in
his
composition
.
He
would
*NL*
have
perished
at
Thermopylae
with
Leonidas
,
and
burned
at
Drogheda
with
*NL*
Cromwell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grantaire
,
''
he
shouted
,
``
go
get
rid
of
the
fumes
of
your
wine
somewhere
*NL*
else
than
here
.
This
is
the
place
for
enthusiasm
,
not
for
drunkenness
.
*NL*
Do
n't
disgrace
the
barricade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
angry
speech
produced
a
singular
effect
on
Grantaire
.
One
would
*NL*
have
said
that
he
had
had
a
glass
of
cold
water
flung
in
his
face
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
be
rendered
suddenly
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
down
,
put
his
elbows
on
a
table
near
the
window
,
looked
at
*NL*
Enjolras
with
indescribable
gentleness
,
and
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
sleep
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
and
sleep
somewhere
else
,
''
cried
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Grantaire
,
still
keeping
his
tender
and
troubled
eyes
fixed
on
him
,
*NL*
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
sleep
here
,
--
until
I
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
regarded
him
with
disdainful
eyes
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grantaire
,
you
are
incapable
of
believing

of
thinking
,
of
willing

living

dying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
replied
in
a
grave
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stammered
a
few
more
unintelligible
words
,
then
his
head
fell
heavily
*NL*
on
the
table
,
and
,
as
is
the
usual
effect
of
the
second
period
of
*NL*
inebriety
,
into
which
Enjolras
had
roughly
and
abruptly
thrust
him
,
an
*NL*
instant
later
he
had
fallen
asleep
.

CHAPTER
IV

AN
ATTEMPT
TO
CONSOLE
THE
WIDOW
HUCHELOUP
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
,
in
ecstasies
over
the
barricade
,
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

's
the
street
in
its
low-necked
dress
!
How
well
it
looks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
as
he
demolished
the
wine-shop
to
some
extent
,
sought
to
*NL*
console
the
widowed
proprietress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
Hucheloup
,
were
n't
you
complaining
the
other
day
because
you
*NL*
had
had
a
notice
served
on
you
for
infringing
the
law
,
because
Gibelotte
*NL*
shook
a
counterpane
out
of
your
window
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
good
Monsieur
Courfeyrac
.
Ah
!
good
Heavens
,
are
you
going
*NL*
to
put
that
table
of
mine
in
your
horror
,
too
?
And
it
was
for
the
*NL*
counterpane
,
and
also
for
a
pot
of
flowers
which
fell
from
the
attic
*NL*
window
into
the
street
,
that
the
government
collected
a
fine
of
a
*NL*
hundred
francs
.
If
that
is
n't
an
abomination
,
what
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Mother
Hucheloup
,
we
are
avenging
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mother
Hucheloup
did
not
appear
to
understand
very
clearly
the
benefit
*NL*
which
she
was
to
derive
from
these
reprisals
made
on
her
account
.
She
*NL*
was
satisfied
after
the
manner
of
that
Arab
woman
,
who
,
having
received
*NL*
a
box
on
the
ear
from
her
husband
,
went
to
complain
to
her
father
,
and
*NL*
cried
for
vengeance
,
saying
:
``
Father
,
you
owe
my
husband
affront
for
*NL*
affront
.
''
The
father
asked
:
``
On
which
cheek
did
you
receive
the
blow
?
''
*NL*
``
On
the
left
cheek
.
''
The
father
slapped
her
right
cheek
and
said
:
``
Now
*NL*
you
are
satisfied
.
Go
tell
your
husband
that
he
boxed
my
daughter
's
*NL*
ears
,
and
that
I
have
accordingly
boxed
his
wife
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
had
ceased
.
Recruits
had
arrived
.
Workmen
had
brought
under
*NL*
their
blouses
a
barrel
of
powder
,
a
basket
containing
bottles
of
*NL*
vitriol
,
two
or
three
carnival
torches
,
and
a
basket
filled
with
*NL*
fire-pots
,
``
left
over
from
the
King
's
festival
.
''
This
festival
was
very
*NL*
recent
,
having
taken
place
on
the
1st
of
May
.
It
was
said
that
these
*NL*
munitions
came
from
a
grocer
in
the
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
named
Pepin
.
*NL*
They
smashed
the
only
street
lantern
in
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
*NL*
the
lantern
corresponding
to
one
in
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
and
all
*NL*
the
lanterns
in
the
surrounding
streets
,
de
Mondetour
,
du
Cygne
,
des
*NL*
Precheurs
,
and
de
la
Grande
and
de
la
Petite-Truanderie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
Combeferre
,
and
Courfeyrac
directed
everything
.
Two
barricades
*NL*
were
now
in
process
of
construction
at
once
,
both
of
them
resting
on
the
*NL*
Corinthe
house
and
forming
a
right
angle
;
the
larger
shut
off
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
the
other
closed
the
Rue
Mondetour
,
on
the
side
of
*NL*
the
Rue
de
Cygne
.
This
last
barricade
,
which
was
very
narrow
,
was
*NL*
constructed
only
of
casks
and
paving-stones
.
There
were
about
fifty
*NL*
workers
on
it
;
thirty
were
armed
with
guns
;
for
,
on
their
way
,
they
had
*NL*
effected
a
wholesale
loan
from
an
armorer
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
bizarre
and
at
the
same
time
more
motley
than
this
*NL*
troop
.
One
had
a
round-jacket
,
a
cavalry
sabre
,
and
two
holster-pistols
,
*NL*
another
was
in
his
shirt-sleeves
,
with
a
round
hat
,
and
a
powder-horn
*NL*
slung
at
his
side
,
a
third
wore
a
plastron
of
nine
sheets
of
gray
paper
*NL*
and
was
armed
with
a
saddler
's
awl
.
There
was
one
who
was
shouting
:
*NL*
``
Let
us
exterminate
them
to
the
last
man
and
die
at
the
point
of
our
*NL*
bayonet
.
''
This
man
had
no
bayonet
.
Another
spread
out
over
his
coat
the
*NL*
cross-belt
and
cartridge-box
of
a
National
Guardsman
,
the
cover
of
the
*NL*
cartridge-box
being
ornamented
with
this
inscription
in
red
worsted
:
*NL*
Public
Order
.
There
were
a
great
many
guns
bearing
the
numbers
of
the
*NL*
legions
,
few
hats
,
no
cravats
,
many
bare
arms
,
some
pikes
.
Add
to
*NL*
this
,
all
ages
,
all
sorts
of
faces
,
small
,
pale
young
men
,
and
bronzed
*NL*
longshoremen
.
All
were
in
haste
;
and
as
they
helped
each
other
,
they
*NL*
discussed
the
possible
chances
.
That
they
would
receive
succor
about
*NL*
three
o'clock
in
the
morning
--
that
they
were
sure
of
one
regiment
,
that
*NL*
Paris
would
rise
.
Terrible
sayings
with
which
was
mingled
a
sort
of
*NL*
cordial
joviality
.
One
would
have
pronounced
them
brothers
,
but
they
did
*NL*
not
know
each
other
's
names
.
Great
perils
have
this
fine
characteristic
,
*NL*
that
they
bring
to
light
the
fraternity
of
strangers
.
A
fire
had
been
*NL*
lighted
in
the
kitchen
,
and
there
they
were
engaged
in
moulding
into
*NL*
bullets
,
pewter
mugs
,
spoons
,
forks
,
and
all
the
brass
table-ware
of
*NL*
the
establishment
.
In
the
midst
of
it
all
,
they
drank
.
Caps
and
*NL*
buckshot
were
mixed
pell-mell
on
the
tables
with
glasses
of
wine
.
In
*NL*
the
billiard-hall
,
Mame
Hucheloup
,
Matelote
,
and
Gibelotte
,
variously
*NL*
modified
by
terror
,
which
had
stupefied
one
,
rendered
another
*NL*
breathless
,
and
roused
the
third
,
were
tearing
up
old
dish-cloths
and
*NL*
making
lint
;
three
insurgents
were
assisting
them
,
three
bushy-haired
,
*NL*
jolly
blades
with
beards
and
moustaches
,
who
plucked
away
at
the
linen
*NL*
with
the
fingers
of
seamstresses
and
who
made
them
tremble
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
of
lofty
stature
whom
Courfeyrac
,
Combeferre
,
and
Enjolras
had
*NL*
observed
at
the
moment
when
he
joined
the
mob
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Rue
des
Billettes
,
was
at
work
on
the
smaller
barricade
and
was
making
*NL*
himself
useful
there
.
Gavroche
was
working
on
the
larger
one
.
As
for
the
*NL*
young
man
who
had
been
waiting
for
Courfeyrac
at
his
lodgings
,
and
who
*NL*
had
inquired
for
M.
Marius
,
he
had
disappeared
at
about
the
time
when
*NL*
the
omnibus
had
been
overturned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
completely
carried
away
and
radiant
,
had
undertaken
to
get
*NL*
everything
in
readiness
.
He
went
,
came
,
mounted
,
descended
,
re-mounted
,
*NL*
whistled
,
and
sparkled
.
He
seemed
to
be
there
for
the
encouragement
of
*NL*
all
.
Had
he
any
incentive
?
Yes
,
certainly
,
his
poverty
;
had
he
wings
?
*NL*
yes
,
certainly
,
his
joy
.
Gavroche
was
a
whirlwind
.
He
was
constantly
*NL*
visible
,
he
was
incessantly
audible
.
He
filled
the
air
,
as
he
was
*NL*
everywhere
at
once
.
He
was
a
sort
of
almost
irritating
ubiquity
;
no
halt
*NL*
was
possible
with
him
.
The
enormous
barricade
felt
him
on
its
haunches
.
*NL*
He
troubled
the
loungers
,
he
excited
the
idle
,
he
reanimated
the
weary
,
*NL*
he
grew
impatient
over
the
thoughtful
,
he
inspired
gayety
in
some
,
*NL*
and
breath
in
others
,
wrath
in
others
,
movement
in
all
,
now
pricking
*NL*
a
student
,
now
biting
an
artisan
;
he
alighted
,
paused
,
flew
off
again
,
*NL*
hovered
over
the
tumult
,
and
the
effort
,
sprang
from
one
party
to
*NL*
another
,
murmuring
and
humming
,
and
harassed
the
whole
company
;
a
fly
on
*NL*
the
immense
revolutionary
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perpetual
motion
was
in
his
little
arms
and
perpetual
clamor
in
his
*NL*
little
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Courage
!
more
paving-stones
!
more
casks
!
more
machines
!
Where
are
you
*NL*
now

A

plaster
for
me
to
stop
this
hole
with

Your
barricade

is
very
small

It
must
be
carried
up

Put
everything

Gibou

Hullo

's

*NL*
*NL*
This
elicited
an
exclamation
from
the
workers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
glass
door
?
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do
with
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hercules

''
retorted
Gavroche
.
``
A
glass
door
is
an
excellent
*NL*
thing
in
a
barricade

It
does
not
prevent
an
attack

but
it
prevents
the
*NL*
enemy
taking
it

never

*NL*
*NL*
However
,
he
was
furious
over
his
triggerless
pistol
.
He
went
from
one
to
*NL*
another
,
demanding
:
``
A
gun

I
want
a

Why
do

``

said
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now

said
Gavroche
,
``
why
not

I
had
one
in
1830
when
we
had
a
*NL*
dispute
with
Charles
X.

*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
there
are
enough
for
the
men

we
will
give
some

*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
wheeled
round
haughtily
,
and
answered
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
killed
before
me

I

*NL*
*NL*
``

Enjolras

A
dandy
who
had
lost
his
way
and
who
lounged
past
the
end

the
street
*NL*
created
a
diversion

CHAPTER
V
--
PREPARATIONS
*NL*
*NL*
The
journals
of
the
day
which
said
that
that
nearly
impregnable
*NL*
structure
,
of
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
as
they
call
*NL*
it
,
reached
to
the
level
of
the
first
floor
,
were
mistaken
.
The
fact
is
,
*NL*
that
it
did
not
exceed
an
average
height
of
six
or
seven
feet
.
It
was
*NL*
built
in
such
a
manner
that
the
combatants
could
,
at
their
will
,
either
*NL*
disappear
behind
it
or
dominate
the
barrier
and
even
scale
its
crest
by
*NL*
means
of
a
quadruple
row
of
paving-stones
placed
on
top
of
each
other
*NL*
and
arranged
as
steps
in
the
interior
.
On
the
outside
,
the
front
of
the
*NL*
barricade
,
composed
of
piles
of
paving-stones
and
casks
bound
together
*NL*
by
beams
and
planks
,
which
were
entangled
in
the
wheels
of
Anceau
's
dray
*NL*
and
of
the
overturned
omnibus
,
had
a
bristling
and
inextricable
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
aperture
large
enough
to
allow
a
man
to
pass
through
had
been
made
*NL*
between
the
wall
of
the
houses
and
the
extremity
of
the
barricade
which
*NL*
was
furthest
from
the
wine-shop
,
so
that
an
exit
was
possible
at
this
*NL*
point
.
The
pole
of
the
omnibus
was
placed
upright
and
held
up
with
*NL*
ropes
,
and
a
red
flag
,
fastened
to
this
pole
,
floated
over
the
*NL*
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
Mondetour
barricade
,
hidden
behind
the
wine-shop
building
,
*NL*
was
not
visible
.
The
two
barricades
united
formed
a
veritable
redoubt
.
*NL*
Enjolras
and
Courfeyrac
had
not
thought
fit
to
barricade
the
other
*NL*
fragment
of
the
Rue
Mondetour
which
opens
through
the
Rue
des
Precheurs
*NL*
an
issue
into
the
Halles
,
wishing
,
no
doubt
,
to
preserve
a
possible
*NL*
communication
with
the
outside
,
and
not
entertaining
much
fear
of
*NL*
an
attack
through
the
dangerous
and
difficult
street
of
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Precheurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
exception
of
this
issue
which
was
left
free
,
and
which
*NL*
constituted
what
Folard
in
his
strategical
style
would
have
termed
a
*NL*
branch
and
taking
into
account
,
also
,
the
narrow
cutting
arranged
on
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
the
interior
of
the
barricade
,
where
the
wine-shop
*NL*
formed
a
salient
angle
,
presented
an
irregular
square
,
closed
on
all
*NL*
sides
.
There
existed
an
interval
of
twenty
paces
between
the
grand
*NL*
barrier
and
the
lofty
houses
which
formed
the
background
of
the
street
,
*NL*
so
that
one
might
say
that
the
barricade
rested
on
these
houses
,
all
*NL*
inhabited
,
but
closed
from
top
to
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
work
was
performed
without
any
hindrance
,
in
less
than
an
hour
,
*NL*
and
without
this
handful
of
bold
men
seeing
a
single
bear-skin
cap
or
*NL*
a
single
bayonet
make
their
appearance
.
The
very
bourgeois
who
still
*NL*
ventured
at
this
hour
of
riot
to
enter
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
cast
a
*NL*
glance
at
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
caught
sight
of
the
barricade
,
and
*NL*
redoubled
their
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
barricades
being
finished
,
and
the
flag
run
up
,
a
table
was
*NL*
dragged
out
of
the
wine-shop
;
and
Courfeyrac
mounted
on
the
table
.
*NL*
Enjolras
brought
the
square
coffer
,
and
Courfeyrac
opened
it
.
This
*NL*
coffer
was
filled
with
cartridges
.
When
the
mob
saw
the
cartridges
,
a
*NL*
tremor
ran
through
the
bravest
,
and
a
momentary
silence
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
distributed
them
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
one
received
thirty
cartridges
.
Many
had
powder
,
and
set
about
*NL*
making
others
with
the
bullets
which
they
had
run
.
As
for
the
barrel
of
*NL*
powder
,
it
stood
on
a
table
on
one
side
,
near
the
door
,
and
was
held
in
*NL*
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
alarm
beat
which
ran
through
all
Paris
,
did
not
cease
,
but
it
had
*NL*
finally
come
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
monotonous
noise
to
which
they
no
*NL*
longer
paid
any
attention
.
This
noise
retreated
at
times
,
and
again
drew
*NL*
near
,
with
melancholy
undulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
loaded
the
guns
and
carbines
,
all
together
,
without
haste
,
with
*NL*
solemn
gravity
.
Enjolras
went
and
stationed
three
sentinels
outside
the
*NL*
barricades
,
one
in
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
the
second
in
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Precheurs
,
the
third
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
de
la
Petite
Truanderie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
the
barricades
having
been
built
,
the
posts
assigned
,
the
guns
*NL*
loaded
,
the
sentinels
stationed
,
they
waited
,
alone
in
those
redoubtable
*NL*
streets
through
which
no
one
passed
any
longer
,
surrounded
by
those
*NL*
dumb
houses
which
seemed
dead
and
in
which
no
human
movement
palpitated
,
*NL*
enveloped
in
the
deepening
shades
of
twilight
which
was
drawing
on
,
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
that
silence
through
which
something
could
be
felt
*NL*
advancing
,
and
which
had
about
it
something
tragic
and
terrifying
,
*NL*
isolated
,
armed
,
determined
,
and
tranquil
.

WAITING
*NL*
*NL*
During
those
hours
of
waiting
,
what
did
they
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
needs
tell
,
since
this
is
a
matter
of
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
men
made
bullets
and
the
women
lint
,
while
a
large
saucepan
*NL*
of
melted
brass
and
lead
,
destined
to
the
bullet-mould
smoked
over
a
*NL*
glowing
brazier
,
while
the
sentinels
watched
,
weapon
in
hand
,
on
the
*NL*
barricade
,
while
Enjolras
,
whom
it
was
impossible
to
divert
,
kept
an
*NL*
eye
on
the
sentinels
,
Combeferre
,
Courfeyrac
,
Jean
Prouvaire
,
Feuilly
,
*NL*
Bossuet
,
Joly
,
Bahorel
,
and
some
others
,
sought
each
other
out
and
*NL*
united
as
in
the
most
peaceful
days
of
their
conversations
in
their
*NL*
student
life
,
and
,
in
one
corner
of
this
wine-shop
which
had
been
*NL*
converted
into
a
casement
,
a
couple
of
paces
distant
from
the
redoubt
*NL*
which
they
had
built
,
with
their
carbines
loaded
and
primed
resting
*NL*
against
the
backs
of
their
chairs
,
these
fine
young
fellows
,
so
close
to
*NL*
a
supreme
hour
,
began
to
recite
love
verses
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
verses
?
These
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
Vous
rappelez-vous
notre
douce

,
*NL*
Lorsque

Et
que

n'avions
au

d'autre
envie
*NL*
Que
d'etre
bien
mis
et
d'etre
amoureux
,
*NL*
*NL*
Lorsqu'en
ajoutant

*NL*
Nous
ne

Et

Tout

Sous

The
hour
,
the
spot
,
these
souvenirs
of
youth
recalled
,
a
few
stars
*NL*
which
began
to
twinkle
in
the
sky
,
the
funeral
repose
of
those
deserted
*NL*
streets
,
the
imminence
of
the
inexorable
adventure
,
which
was
in
*NL*
preparation
,
gave
a
pathetic
charm
to
these
verses
murmured
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
in
the
dusk
by
Jean
Prouvaire
,
who
,
as
we
have
said
,
was
a
gentle
*NL*
poet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
a
lamp
had
been
lighted
in
the
small
barricade
,
and
in
*NL*
the
large
one
,
one
of
those
wax
torches
such
as
are
to
be
met
with
on
*NL*
Shrove-Tuesday
in
front
of
vehicles
loaded
with
masks
,
on
their
way
*NL*
to
la
Courtille
.
These
torches
,
as
the
reader
has
seen
,
came
from
the
*NL*
Faubourg
Saint-Antoine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
torch
had
been
placed
in
a
sort
of
cage
of
paving-stones
closed
on
*NL*
three
sides
to
shelter
it
from
the
wind
,
and
disposed
in
such
a
fashion
*NL*
that
all
the
light
fell
on
the
flag
.
The
street
and
the
barricade
*NL*
remained
sunk
in
gloom
,
and
nothing
was
to
be
seen
except
the
red
flag
*NL*
formidably
illuminated
as
by
an
enormous
dark-lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
light
enhanced
the
scarlet
of
the
flag
,
with
an
indescribable
and
*NL*
terrible
purple
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
MAN
RECRUITED
IN
THE
RUE
DES
BILLETTES
*NL*
*NL*
Night
was
fully
come
,
nothing
made
its
appearance
.
All
that
they
heard
*NL*
was
confused
noises
,
and
at
intervals
,
fusillades
;
but
these
were
rare
,
*NL*
badly
sustained
and
distant
.
This
respite
,
which
was
thus
prolonged
,
*NL*
was
a
sign
that
the
Government
was
taking
its
time
,
and
collecting
its
*NL*
forces
.
These
fifty
men
were
waiting
for
sixty
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
felt
attacked
by
that
impatience
which
seizes
on
strong
souls
*NL*
on
the
threshold
of
redoubtable
events
.
He
went
in
search
of
Gavroche
,
*NL*
who
had
set
to
making
cartridges
in
the
tap-room
,
by
the
dubious
light
*NL*
of
two
candles
placed
on
the
counter
by
way
of
precaution
,
on
account
of
*NL*
the
powder
which
was
scattered
on
the
tables
.
These
two
candles
cast
no
*NL*
gleam
outside
.
The
insurgents
had
,
moreover
,
taken
pains
not
to
have
any
*NL*
light
in
the
upper
stories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
was
deeply
preoccupied
at
that
moment
,
but
not
precisely
with
*NL*
his
cartridges
.
The
man
of
the
Rue
des
Billettes
had
just
entered
*NL*
the
tap-room
and
had
seated
himself
at
the
table
which
was
the
least
*NL*
lighted
.
A
musket
of
large
model
had
fallen
to
his
share
,
and
he
held
it
*NL*
between
his
legs
.
Gavroche
,
who
had
been
,
up
to
that
moment
,
distracted
*NL*
by
a
hundred
``
amusing
''
things
,
had
not
even
seen
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
entered
,
Gavroche
followed
him
mechanically
with
his
eyes
,
*NL*
admiring
his
gun
;
then
,
all
at
once
,
when
the
man
was
seated
,
the
street
*NL*
urchin
sprang
to
his
feet
.
Any
one
who
had
spied
upon
that
man
up
to
*NL*
that
moment
,
would
have
seen
that
he
was
observing
everything
in
the
*NL*
barricade
and
in
the
band
of
insurgents
,
with
singular
attention
;
but
,
*NL*
from
the
moment
when
he
had
entered
this
room
,
he
had
fallen
into
a
sort
*NL*
of
brown
study
,
and
no
longer
seemed
to
see
anything
that
was
going
on
.
*NL*
The
gamin
approached
this
pensive
personage
,
and
began
to
step
around
*NL*
him
on
tiptoe
,
as
one
walks
in
the
vicinity
of
a
person
whom
one
is
*NL*
afraid
of
waking
.
At
the
same
time
,
over
his
childish
countenance
which
*NL*
was
,
at
once
so
impudent
and
so
serious
,
so
giddy
and
so
profound
,
so
*NL*
gay
and
so
heart-breaking
,
passed
all
those
grimaces
of
an
old
man
which
*NL*
signify
:
Ah
bah
!
impossible
!
My
sight
is
bad
!
I
am
dreaming
!
can
this
*NL*
be
?
no
,
it
is
not
!
but
yes
!
why
,
no
!
etc.
.
Gavroche
balanced
on
his
*NL*
heels
,
clenched
both
fists
in
his
pockets
,
moved
his
neck
around
like
a
*NL*
bird
,
expended
in
a
gigantic
pout
all
the
sagacity
of
his
lower
lip
.
He
*NL*
was
astounded
,
uncertain
,
incredulous
,
convinced
,
dazzled
.
He
had
the
*NL*
mien
of
the
chief
of
the
eunuchs
in
the
slave
mart
,
discovering
a
*NL*
Venus
among
the
blowsy
females
,
and
the
air
of
an
amateur
recognizing
*NL*
a
Raphael
in
a
heap
of
daubs
.
His
whole
being
was
at
work
,
the
instinct
*NL*
which
scents
out
,
and
the
intelligence
which
combines
.
It
was
evident
*NL*
that
a
great
event
had
happened
in
Gavroche
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
most
intense
point
of
this
preoccupation
that
Enjolras
*NL*
accosted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
small
,
''
said
Enjolras
,
``
you
will
not
be
seen
.
Go
out
of
the
*NL*
barricade
,
slip
along
close
to
the
houses
,
skirmish
about
a
bit
in
the
*NL*
streets
,
and
come
back
and
tell
me
what
is
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
raised
himself
on
his
haunches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
little
chaps
are
good
for
something
!
that
's
very
lucky
!
I
'll
*NL*
go
!
In
the
meanwhile
,
trust
to
the
little
fellows
,
and
distrust
the
big
*NL*
ones
.
''
And
Gavroche
,
raising
his
head
and
lowering
his
voice
,
added
,
*NL*
as
he
indicated
the
man
of
the
Rue
des
Billettes
:
``
Do
you
see
that
big
*NL*
fellow
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
police
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
two
weeks
since
he
pulled
me
off
the
cornice
of
the
Port
*NL*
Royal
,
where
I
was
taking
the
air
,
by
my
ear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
hastily
quitted
the
urchin
and
murmured
a
few
words
in
a
very
*NL*
low
tone
to
a
longshoreman
from
the
winedocks
who
chanced
to
be
at
hand
.
*NL*
The
man
left
the
room
,
and
returned
almost
immediately
,
accompanied
by
*NL*
three
others
.
The
four
men
,
four
porters
with
broad
shoulders
,
went
*NL*
and
placed
themselves
without
doing
anything
to
attract
his
attention
,
*NL*
behind
the
table
on
which
the
man
of
the
Rue
des
Billettes
was
leaning
*NL*
with
his
elbows
.
They
were
evidently
ready
to
hurl
themselves
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Enjolras
approached
the
man
and
demanded
of
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
abrupt
query
,
the
man
started
.
He
plunged
his
gaze
deep
into
*NL*
Enjolras
'
clear
eyes
and
appeared
to
grasp
the
latter
's
meaning
.
He
*NL*
smiled
with
a
smile
than
which
nothing
more
disdainful
,
more
energetic
,
*NL*
and
more
resolute
could
be
seen
in
the
world
,
and
replied
with
haughty
*NL*
gravity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
what
it
is
.
Well
,
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
police
spy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
an
agent
of
the
authorities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
made
a
sign
to
the
four
men
.
In
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
before
*NL*
Javert
had
time
to
turn
round
,
he
was
collared
,
thrown
down
,
pinioned
*NL*
and
searched
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
on
him
a
little
round
card
pasted
between
two
pieces
of
*NL*
glass
,
and
bearing
on
one
side
the
arms
of
France
,
engraved
,
and
with
*NL*
this
motto
:
Supervision
and
vigilance
,
and
on
the
other
this
note
:
*NL*
``
JAVERT
,
inspector
of
police
,
aged
fifty-two
,
''
and
the
signature
of
the
*NL*
Prefect
of
Police
of
that
day
,
M.
Gisquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
this
,
he
had
his
watch
and
his
purse
,
which
contained
several
*NL*
gold
pieces
.
They
left
him
his
purse
and
his
watch
.
Under
the
watch
,
*NL*
at
the
bottom
of
his
fob
,
they
felt
and
seized
a
paper
in
an
envelope
,
*NL*
which
Enjolras
unfolded
,
and
on
which
he
read
these
five
lines
,
written
*NL*
in
the
very
hand
of
the
Prefect
of
Police
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
soon
as
his
political
mission
is
accomplished
,
Inspector
Javert
*NL*
will
make
sure
,
by
special
supervision
,
whether
it
is
true
that
the
*NL*
malefactors
have
instituted
intrigues
on
the
right
bank
of
the
Seine
,
*NL*
near
the
Jena
bridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
search
ended
,
they
lifted
Javert
to
his
feet
,
bound
his
arms
behind
*NL*
his
back
,
and
fastened
him
to
that
celebrated
post
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
room
which
had
formerly
given
the
wine-shop
its
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
who
had
looked
on
at
the
whole
of
this
scene
and
had
approved
*NL*
of
everything
with
a
silent
toss
of
his
head
,
stepped
up
to
Javert
and
*NL*
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
mouse
who
has
caught
the
cat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
so
rapidly
executed
,
that
it
was
all
over
when
those
about
*NL*
the
wine-shop
noticed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
had
not
uttered
a
single
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
of
Javert
bound
to
the
post
,
Courfeyrac
,
Bossuet
,
Joly
,
*NL*
Combeferre
,
and
the
men
scattered
over
the
two
barricades
came
running
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
,
with
his
back
to
the
post
,
and
so
surrounded
with
ropes
that
he
*NL*
could
not
make
a
movement
,
raised
his
head
with
the
intrepid
serenity
of
*NL*
the
man
who
has
never
lied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
police
spy
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
to
Javert
:
``
You
will
be
shot
ten
minutes
before
the
*NL*
barricade
is
taken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
replied
in
his
most
imperious
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
at
once
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
saving
our
powder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
finish
the
business
with
a
blow
from
a
knife

*NL*
*NL*
``
Spy
,
''
said
the
handsome
Enjolras
,
``
we
are
judges
and
not
assassins

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
called
Gavroche
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you

go
about
your
business
!
Do
what
I
told
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
!
''
cried
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
halting
as
he
was
on
the
point
of
setting
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
you
will
give
me
his
gun

''
and
he
added
:
``
I
leave
you
the
*NL*
musician
,
but
I
want
the
clarionet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
made
the
military
salute
and
passed
gayly
through
the
opening
*NL*
in
the
large
barricade

CHAPTER
VIII
--
MANY
INTERROGATION
POINTS
WITH
REGARD
TO
A
CERTAIN
LE
*NL*
CABUC
WHOSE
NAME
MAY
NOT
HAVE
BEEN
LE
CABUC
*NL*
*NL*
The
tragic
picture
which
we
have
undertaken
would
not
be
complete
,
the
*NL*
reader
would
not
see
those
grand
moments
of
social
birth-pangs
in
a
*NL*
revolutionary
birth
,
which
contain
convulsion
mingled
with
effort
,
*NL*
in
their
exact
and
real
relief
,
were
we
to
omit
,
in
the
sketch
here
*NL*
outlined
,
an
incident
full
of
epic
and
savage
horror
which
occurred
*NL*
almost
immediately
after
Gavroche
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mobs
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
are
like
a
snowball
,
and
collect
as
they
*NL*
roll
along
,
a
throng
of
tumultuous
men
.
These
men
do
not
ask
each
other
*NL*
whence
they
come
.
Among
the
passers-by
who
had
joined
the
rabble
led
by
*NL*
Enjolras
,
Combeferre
,
and
Courfeyrac
,
there
had
been
a
person
wearing
*NL*
the
jacket
of
a
street
porter
,
which
was
very
threadbare
on
the
*NL*
shoulders
,
who
gesticulated
and
vociferated
,
and
who
had
the
look
of
a
*NL*
drunken
savage
.
This
man
,
whose
name
or
nickname
was
Le
Cabuc
,
and
who
*NL*
was
,
moreover
,
an
utter
stranger
to
those
who
pretended
to
know
him
,
*NL*
was
very
drunk
,
or
assumed
the
appearance
of
being
so
,
and
had
seated
*NL*
himself
with
several
others
at
a
table
which
they
had
dragged
outside
*NL*
of
the
wine-shop
.
This
Cabuc
,
while
making
those
who
vied
with
him
drunk
*NL*
seemed
to
be
examining
with
a
thoughtful
air
the
large
house
at
the
*NL*
extremity
of
the
barricade
,
whose
five
stories
commanded
the
whole
*NL*
street
and
faced
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
.
All
at
once
he
exclaimed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
,
comrades
,
it
is
from
that
house
yonder
that
we
must
fire
.
*NL*
When
we
are
at
the
windows
,
the
deuce
is
in
it
if
any
one
can
advance
*NL*
into
the
street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
the
house
is
closed
,
''
said
one
of
the
drinkers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
knock
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
not
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
break
in
the
door
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Le
Cabuc
runs
to
the
door
,
which
had
a
very
massive
knocker
,
and
knocks
.
*NL*
The
door
opens
not
.
He
strikes
a
second
blow
.
No
one
answers
.
A
third
*NL*
stroke
.
The
same
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
any
one
here
?
''
shouts
Cabuc
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
stirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
seizes
a
gun
and
begins
to
batter
the
door
with
the
butt
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
ancient
alley
door
,
low
,
vaulted
,
narrow
,
solid
,
entirely
of
*NL*
oak
,
lined
on
the
inside
with
a
sheet
of
iron
and
iron
stays
,
a
genuine
*NL*
prison
postern
.
The
blows
from
the
butt
end
of
the
gun
made
the
house
*NL*
tremble
,
but
did
not
shake
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
it
is
probable
that
the
inhabitants
were
disturbed
,
for
a
*NL*
tiny
,
square
window
was
finally
seen
to
open
on
the
third
story
,
and
at
*NL*
this
aperture
appeared
the
reverend
and
terrified
face
of
a
gray-haired
*NL*
old
man
,
who
was
the
porter
,
and
who
held
a
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
was
knocking
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gentlemen
,
''
said
the
porter
,
``
what
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
!
''
said
Cabuc
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
can
not
be
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Open
,
nevertheless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Le
Cabuc
took
his
gun
and
aimed
at
the
porter
;
but
as
he
was
below
,
and
*NL*
as
it
was
very
dark
,
the
porter
did
not
see
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
open
,
yes
or
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
gentlemen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
no
,
my
goo
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
did
not
finish
.
The
shot
was
fired
;
the
ball
entered
under
*NL*
his
chin
and
came
out
at
the
nape
of
his
neck
,
after
traversing
the
*NL*
jugular
vein
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
fell
back
without
a
sigh
.
The
candle
fell
and
was
*NL*
extinguished
,
and
nothing
more
was
to
be
seen
except
a
motionless
head
*NL*
lying
on
the
sill
of
the
small
window
,
and
a
little
whitish
smoke
which
*NL*
floated
off
towards
the
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Le
Cabuc
,
dropping
the
butt
end
of
his
gun
to
the
*NL*
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hardly
uttered
this
word
,
when
he
felt
a
hand
laid
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
with
the
weight
of
an
eagle
's
talon
,
and
he
heard
a
voice
*NL*
saying
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
your
knees
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
murderer
turned
round
and
saw
before
him
Enjolras
'
cold
,
white
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
held
a
pistol
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
hastened
up
at
the
sound
of
the
discharge
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
seized
Cabuc
's
collar
,
blouse
,
shirt
,
and
suspender
with
his
left
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
your
knees
!
''
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
with
an
imperious
motion
,
the
frail
young
man
of
twenty
years
bent
*NL*
the
thickset
and
sturdy
porter
like
a
reed
,
and
brought
him
to
his
knees
*NL*
in
the
mire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Le
Cabuc
attempted
to
resist
,
but
he
seemed
to
have
been
seized
by
a
*NL*
superhuman
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
pale
,
with
bare
neck
and
dishevelled
hair
,
and
his
woman
's
*NL*
face
,
had
about
him
at
that
moment
something
of
the
antique
Themis
.
*NL*
His
dilated
nostrils
,
his
downcast
eyes
,
gave
to
his
implacable
Greek
*NL*
profile
that
expression
of
wrath
and
that
expression
of
Chastity
which
,
*NL*
as
the
ancient
world
viewed
the
matter
,
befit
Justice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
barricade
hastened
up
,
then
all
ranged
themselves
in
a
circle
*NL*
at
a
distance
,
feeling
that
it
was
impossible
to
utter
a
word
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
thing
which
they
were
about
to
behold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Le
Cabuc
,
vanquished
,
no
longer
tried
to
struggle
,
and
trembled
in
every
*NL*
limb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
released
him
and
drew
out
his
watch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Collect
yourself
,
''
said
he
.
``
Think
or
pray
.
You
have
one
minute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
''
murmured
the
murderer
;
then
he
dropped
his
head
and
stammered
a
*NL*
few
inarticulate
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
never
took
his
eyes
off
of
him
:
he
allowed
a
minute
to
pass
,
*NL*
then
he
replaced
his
watch
in
his
fob
.
That
done
,
he
grasped
Le
Cabuc
*NL*
by
the
hair
,
as
the
latter
coiled
himself
into
a
ball
at
his
knees
and
*NL*
shrieked
,
and
placed
the
muzzle
of
the
pistol
to
his
ear
.
Many
of
those
*NL*
intrepid
men
,
who
had
so
tranquilly
entered
upon
the
most
terrible
of
*NL*
adventures
,
turned
aside
their
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
explosion
was
heard
,
the
assassin
fell
to
the
pavement
face
*NL*
downwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
straightened
himself
up
,
and
cast
a
convinced
and
severe
glance
*NL*
around
him
.
Then
he
spurned
the
corpse
with
his
foot
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Throw
that
outside
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
men
raised
the
body
of
the
unhappy
wretch
,
which
was
still
*NL*
agitated
by
the
last
mechanical
convulsions
of
the
life
that
had
fled
,
*NL*
and
flung
it
over
the
little
barricade
into
the
Rue
Mondetour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
was
thoughtful
.
It
is
impossible
to
say
what
grandiose
shadows
*NL*
slowly
spread
over
his
redoubtable
serenity
.
All
at
once
he
raised
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
fell
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizens
,
''
said
Enjolras
,
``
what
that
man
did
is
frightful
,
what
I
have
*NL*
done
is
horrible
.
He
killed
,
therefore
I
killed
him
.
I
had
to
do
it
,
*NL*
because
insurrection
must
have
its
discipline
.
Assassination
is
even
*NL*
more
of
a
crime
here
than
elsewhere
;
we
are
under
the
eyes
of
the
*NL*
Revolution
,
we
are
the
priests
of
the
Republic
,
we
are
the
victims
of
*NL*
duty
,
and
must
not
be
possible
to
slander
our
combat
.
I
have
,
therefore
,
*NL*
tried
that
man
,
and
condemned
him
to
death
.
As
for
myself
,
constrained
*NL*
as
I
am
to
do
what
I
have
done
,
and
yet
abhorring
it
,
I
have
judged
*NL*
myself
also
,
and
you
shall
soon
see
to
what
I
have
condemned
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
listened
to
him
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
share
thy
fate
,
''
cried
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
,
''
replied
Enjolras
.
``
One
word
more
.
In
executing
this
man
,
*NL*
I
have
obeyed
necessity
;
but
necessity
is
a
monster
of
the
old
world
,
*NL*
necessity
's
name
is
Fatality
.
Now
,
the
law
of
progress
is
,
that
monsters
*NL*
shall
disappear
before
the
angels
,
and
that
Fatality
shall
vanish
before
*NL*
Fraternity
.
It
is
a
bad
moment
to
pronounce
the
word
love
.
No
matter
,
I
*NL*
do
pronounce
it
.
And
I
glorify
it
.
Love
,
the
future
is
thine
.
Death
,
I
*NL*
make
use
of
thee
,
but
I
hate
thee
.
Citizens
,
in
the
future
there
will
*NL*
be
neither
darkness
nor
thunderbolts
;
neither
ferocious
ignorance
,
nor
*NL*
bloody
retaliation
.
As
there
will
be
no
more
Satan
,
there
will
be
no
*NL*
more
Michael
.
In
the
future
no
one
will
kill
any
one
else
,
the
earth
*NL*
will
beam
with
radiance
,
the
human
race
will
love
.
The
day
will
come
,
*NL*
citizens
,
when
all
will
be
concord
,
harmony
,
light
,
joy
and
life
;
it
*NL*
will
come
,
and
it
is
in
order
that
it
may
come
that
we
are
about
to
*NL*
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
ceased
.
His
virgin
lips
closed
;
and
he
remained
for
some
time
*NL*
standing
on
the
spot
where
he
had
shed
blood
,
in
marble
immobility
.
His
*NL*
staring
eye
caused
those
about
him
to
speak
in
low
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Prouvaire
and
Combeferre
pressed
each
other
's
hands
silently
,
and
,
*NL*
leaning
against
each
other
in
an
angle
of
the
barricade
,
they
watched
*NL*
with
an
admiration
in
which
there
was
some
compassion
,
that
grave
young
*NL*
man
,
executioner
and
priest
,
composed
of
light
,
like
crystal
,
and
also
*NL*
of
rock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
at
once
that
later
on
,
after
the
action
,
when
the
bodies
were
*NL*
taken
to
the
morgue
and
searched
,
a
police
agent
's
card
was
found
on
Le
*NL*
Cabuc
.
The
author
of
this
book
had
in
his
hands
,
in
1848
,
the
special
*NL*
report
on
this
subject
made
to
the
Prefect
of
Police
in

We
will
add
,
that
if
we
are
to
believe
a
tradition
of
the
police
,
which
*NL*
is
strange
but
probably
well
founded
,
Le
Cabuc
was
Claquesous
.
The
fact
*NL*
is
,
that
dating
from
the
death
of
Le
Cabuc
,
there
was
no
longer
any
*NL*
question
of
Claquesous
.
Claquesous
had
nowhere
left
any
trace
of
his
*NL*
disappearance
;
he
would
seem
to
have
amalgamated
himself
with
the
*NL*
invisible
.
His
life
had
been
all
shadows
,
his
end
was
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
insurgent
group
was
still
under
the
influence
of
the
emotion
*NL*
of
that
tragic
case
which
had
been
so
quickly
tried
and
so
quickly
*NL*
terminated
,
when
Courfeyrac
again
beheld
on
the
barricade
,
the
small
*NL*
young
man
who
had
inquired
of
him
that
morning
for
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
lad
,
who
had

bold
and
reckless
air
,
had
come
by
night

insurgents

CHAPTER
I
--
FROM
THE
RUE
PLUMET
TO
THE
QUARTIER
SAINT-DENIS
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
which
had
summoned
Marius
through
the
twilight
to
the
*NL*
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
had
produced
on
him
the
effect
*NL*
of
the
voice
of
destiny
.
He
wished
to
die
;
the
opportunity
presented
*NL*
itself
;
he
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
tomb
,
a
hand
in
the
darkness
*NL*
offered
him
the
key
.
These
melancholy
openings
which
take
place
in
the
*NL*
gloom
before
despair
,
are
tempting
.
Marius
thrust
aside
the
bar
which
*NL*
had
so
often
allowed
him
to
pass
,
emerged
from
the
garden
,
and
said
:
``
I
*NL*
will
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mad
with
grief
,
no
longer
conscious
of
anything
fixed
or
solid
in
his
*NL*
brain
,
incapable
of
accepting
anything
thenceforth
of
fate
after
those
*NL*
two
months
passed
in
the
intoxication
of
youth
and
love
,
overwhelmed
at
*NL*
once
by
all
the
reveries
of
despair
,
he
had
but
one
desire
remaining
,
to
*NL*
make
a
speedy
end
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
at
rapid
pace
.
He
found
himself
most
opportunely
armed
,
as
he
*NL*
had
Javert
's
pistols
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
man
of
whom
he
thought
that
he
had
caught
a
glimpse
,
had
*NL*
vanished
from
his
sight
in
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
who
had
emerged
from
the
Rue
Plumet
by
the
boulevard
,
traversed
*NL*
the
Esplanade
and
the
bridge
of
the
Invalides
,
the
Champs
Elysees
,
the
*NL*
Place
Louis
XV.
,
and
reached
the
Rue
de
Rivoli
.
The
shops
were
open
*NL*
there
,
the
gas
was
burning
under
the
arcades
,
women
were
making
their
*NL*
purchases
in
the
stalls
,
people
were
eating
ices
in
the
Cafe
Laiter
,
*NL*
and
nibbling
small
cakes
at
the
English
pastry-cook
's
shop
.
Only
a
few
*NL*
posting-chaises
were
setting
out
at
a
gallop
from
the
Hotel
des
Princes
*NL*
and
the
Hotel
Meurice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
entered
the
Rue
Saint-Honore
through
the
Passage
Delorme
.
There
*NL*
the
shops
were
closed
,
the
merchants
were
chatting
in
front
of
their
*NL*
half-open
doors
,
people
were
walking
about
,
the
street
lanterns
were
*NL*
lighted
,
beginning
with
the
first
floor
,
all
the
windows
were
lighted
as
*NL*
usual
.
There
was
cavalry
on
the
Place
du
Palais-Royal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
followed
the
Rue
Saint-Honore
.
In
proportion
as
he
left
the
*NL*
Palais-Royal
behind
him
,
there
were
fewer
lighted
windows
,
the
shops
*NL*
were
fast
shut
,
no
one
was
chatting
on
the
thresholds
,
the
street
grew
*NL*
sombre
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
crowd
increased
in
density
.
For
the
*NL*
passers-by
now
amounted
to
a
crowd
.
No
one
could
be
seen
to
speak
in
*NL*
this
throng
,
and
yet
there
arose
from
it
a
dull
,
deep
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Near
the
fountain
of
the
Arbre-Sec
,
there
were
``
assemblages
''
,
motionless
*NL*
and
gloomy
groups
which
were
to
those
who
went
and
came
as
stones
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
running
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
entrance
to
the
Rue
des
Prouvaires
,
the
crowd
no
longer
walked
.
*NL*
It
formed
a
resisting
,
massive
,
solid
,
compact
,
almost
impenetrable
*NL*
block
of
people
who
were
huddled
together
,
and
conversing
in
low
tones
.
*NL*
There
were
hardly
any
black
coats
or
round
hats
now
,
but
smock
frocks
,
*NL*
blouses
,
caps
,
and
bristling
and
cadaverous
heads
.
This
multitude
*NL*
undulated
confusedly
in
the
nocturnal
gloom
.
Its
whisperings
had
the
*NL*
hoarse
accent
of
a
vibration
.
Although
not
one
of
them
was
walking
,
a
*NL*
dull
trampling
was
audible
in
the
mire
.
Beyond
this
dense
portion
of
*NL*
the
throng
,
in
the
Rue
du
Roule
,
in
the
Rue
des
Prouvaires
,
and
in
the
*NL*
extension
of
the
Rue
Saint-Honore
,
there
was
no
longer
a
single
window
*NL*
in
which
a
candle
was
burning
.
Only
the
solitary
and
diminishing
rows
*NL*
of
lanterns
could
be
seen
vanishing
into
the
street
in
the
distance
.
The
*NL*
lanterns
of
that
date
resembled
large
red
stars
,
hanging
to
ropes
,
and
*NL*
shed
upon
the
pavement
a
shadow
which
had
the
form
of
a
huge
spider
.
*NL*
These
streets
were
not
deserted
.
There
could
be
descried
piles
of
guns
,
*NL*
moving
bayonets
,
and
troops
bivouacking
.
No
curious
observer
passed
that
*NL*
limit
.
There
circulation
ceased
.
There
the
rabble
ended
and
the
army
*NL*
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
willed
with
the
will
of
a
man
who
hopes
no
more
.
He
had
been
*NL*
summoned
,
he
must
go
.
He
found
a
means
to
traverse
the
throng
and
to
*NL*
pass
the
bivouac
of
the
troops
,
he
shunned
the
patrols
,
he
avoided
the
*NL*
sentinels
.
He
made
a
circuit
,
reached
the
Rue
de
Bethisy
,
and
directed
*NL*
his
course
towards
the
Halles
.
At
the
corner
of
the
Rue
des
Bourdonnais
,
*NL*
there
were
no
longer
any
lanterns
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
having
passed
the
zone
of
the
crowd
,
he
had
passed
the
limits
of
*NL*
the
troops
;
he
found
himself
in
something
startling
.
There
was
no
longer
*NL*
a
passer-by
,
no
longer
a
soldier
,
no
longer
a
light
,
there
was
no
one
;
*NL*
solitude
,
silence
,
night
,
I
know
not
what
chill
which
seized
hold
upon
*NL*
one
.
Entering
a
street
was
like
entering
a
cellar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
few
steps
.
Some
one
passed
close
to
him
at
a
run
.
Was
it
a
*NL*
man
?
Or
a
woman
?
Were
there
many
of
them
?
he
could
not
have
told
.
It
had
*NL*
passed
and
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Proceeding
from
circuit
to
circuit
,
he
reached
a
lane
which
he
judged
*NL*
to
be
the
Rue
de
la
Poterie
;
near
the
middle
of
this
street
,
he
came
in
*NL*
contact
with
an
obstacle
.
He
extended
his
hands
.
It
was
an
overturned
*NL*
wagon
;
his
foot
recognized
pools
of
water
,
gullies
,
and
paving-stones
*NL*
scattered
and
piled
up
.
A
barricade
had
been
begun
there
and
abandoned
.
*NL*
He
climbed
over
the
stones
and
found
himself
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
barrier
.
He
walked
very
near
the
street-posts
,
and
guided
himself
along
*NL*
the
walls
of
the
houses
.
A
little
beyond
the
barricade
,
it
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
he
could
make
out
something
white
in
front
of
him
.
He
approached
,
*NL*
it
took
on
a
form
.
It
was
two
white
horses
;
the
horses
of
the
omnibus
*NL*
harnessed
by
Bossuet
in
the
morning
,
who
had
been
straying
at
random
all
*NL*
day
from
street
to
street
,
and
had
finally
halted
there
,
with
the
weary
*NL*
patience
of
brutes
who
no
more
understand
the
actions
of
men
,
than
man
*NL*
understands
the
actions
of
Providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
left
the
horses
behind
him
.
As
he
was
approaching
a
street
which
*NL*
seemed
to
him
to
be
the
Rue
du
Contrat-Social
,
a
shot
coming
no
one
*NL*
knows
whence
,
and
traversing
the
darkness
at
random
,
whistled
close
by
*NL*
him
,
and
the
bullet
pierced
a
brass
shaving-dish
suspended
above
his
*NL*
head
over
a
hairdresser
's
shop
.
This
pierced
shaving-dish
was
still
*NL*
to
be
seen
in
1848
,
in
the
Rue
du
Contrat-Social
,
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
pillars
of
the
market
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
shot
still
betokened
life
.
From
that
instant
forth
he
encountered
*NL*
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
of
this
itinerary
resembled
a
descent
of
black
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
Marius
pressed
forward
.

CHAPTER
II
--
AN
OWL
'S
VIEW
OF
PARIS
*NL*
*NL*
A
being
who
could
have
hovered
over
Paris
that
night
with
the
wing
of
*NL*
the
bat
or
the
owl
would
have
had
beneath
his
eyes
a
gloomy
spectacle
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
old
quarter
of
the
Halles
,
which
is
like
a
city
within
a
*NL*
city
,
through
which
run
the
Rues
Saint-Denis
and
Saint-Martin
,
where
a
*NL*
thousand
lanes
cross
,
and
of
which
the
insurgents
had
made
their
*NL*
redoubt
and
their
stronghold
,
would
have
appeared
to
him
like
a
dark
and
*NL*
enormous
cavity
hollowed
out
in
the
centre
of
Paris
.
There
the
glance
*NL*
fell
into
an
abyss
.
Thanks
to
the
broken
lanterns
,
thanks
to
the
closed
*NL*
windows
,
there
all
radiance
,
all
life
,
all
sound
,
all
movement
ceased
.
*NL*
The
invisible
police
of
the
insurrection
were
on
the
watch
everywhere
,
*NL*
and
maintained
order
,
that
is
to
say
,
night
.
The
necessary
tactics
of
*NL*
insurrection
are
to
drown
small
numbers
in
a
vast
obscurity
,
to
multiply
*NL*
every
combatant
by
the
possibilities
which
that
obscurity
contains
.
At
*NL*
dusk
,
every
window
where
a
candle
was
burning
received
a
shot
.
The
light
*NL*
was
extinguished
,
sometimes
the
inhabitant
was
killed
.
Hence
nothing
was
*NL*
stirring
.
There
was
nothing
but
fright
,
mourning
,
stupor
in
the
houses
;
*NL*
and
in
the
streets
,
a
sort
of
sacred
horror
.
Not
even
the
long
rows
of
*NL*
windows
and
stores
,
the
indentations
of
the
chimneys
,
and
the
roofs
,
*NL*
and
the
vague
reflections
which
are
cast
back
by
the
wet
and
muddy
*NL*
pavements
,
were
visible
.
An
eye
cast
upward
at
that
mass
of
shadows
*NL*
might
,
perhaps
,
have
caught
a
glimpse
here
and
there
,
at
intervals
,
*NL*
of
indistinct
gleams
which
brought
out
broken
and
eccentric
lines
,
and
*NL*
profiles
of
singular
buildings
,
something
like
the
lights
which
go
and
*NL*
come
in
ruins
;
it
was
at
such
points
that
the
barricades
were
situated
.
*NL*
The
rest
was
a
lake
of
obscurity
,
foggy
,
heavy
,
and
funereal
,
above
*NL*
which
,
in
motionless
and
melancholy
outlines
,
rose
the
tower
of
*NL*
Saint-Jacques
,
the
church
of
Saint-Merry
,
and
two
or
three
more
of
those
*NL*
grand
edifices
of
which
man
makes
giants
and
the
night
makes
phantoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
around
this
deserted
and
disquieting
labyrinth
,
in
the
quarters
*NL*
where
the
Parisian
circulation
had
not
been
annihilated
,
and
where
a
*NL*
few
street
lanterns
still
burned
,
the
aerial
observer
might
have
*NL*
distinguished
the
metallic
gleam
of
swords
and
bayonets
,
the
dull
rumble
*NL*
of
artillery
,
and
the
swarming
of
silent
battalions
whose
ranks
were
*NL*
swelling
from
minute
to
minute
;
a
formidable
girdle
which
was
slowly
*NL*
drawing
in
and
around
the
insurrection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invested
quarter
was
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
monstrous
*NL*
cavern
;
everything
there
appeared
to
be
asleep
or
motionless
,
and
,
as
we
*NL*
have
just
seen
,
any
street
which
one
might
come
to
offered
nothing
but
*NL*
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
wild
darkness
,
full
of
traps
,
full
of
unseen
and
formidable
shocks
,
*NL*
into
which
it
was
alarming
to
penetrate
,
and
in
which
it
was
terrible
to
*NL*
remain
,
where
those
who
entered
shivered
before
those
whom
they
awaited
,
*NL*
where
those
who
waited
shuddered
before
those
who
were
coming
.
Invisible
*NL*
combatants
were
entrenched
at
every
corner
of
the
street
;
snares
of
the
*NL*
sepulchre
concealed
in
the
density
of
night
.
All
was
over
.
No
more
*NL*
light
was
to
be
hoped
for
,
henceforth
,
except
the
lightning
of
guns
,
*NL*
no
further
encounter
except
the
abrupt
and
rapid
apparition
of
death
.
*NL*
Where
?
How
?
When
?
No
one
knew
,
but
it
was
certain
and
inevitable
.
In
*NL*
this
place
which
had
been
marked
out
for
the
struggle
,
the
Government
*NL*
and
the
insurrection
,
the
National
Guard
,
and
popular
societies
,
the
*NL*
bourgeois
and
the
uprising
,
groping
their
way
,
were
about
to
come
into
*NL*
contact
.
The
necessity
was
the
same
for
both
.
The
only
possible
issue
*NL*
thenceforth
was
to
emerge
thence
killed
or
conquerors
.
A
situation
so
*NL*
extreme
,
an
obscurity
so
powerful
,
that
the
most
timid
felt
themselves
*NL*
seized
with
resolution
,
and
the
most
daring
with
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
on
both
sides
,
the
fury
,
the
rage
,
and
the
determination
were
*NL*
equal
.
For
the
one
party
,
to
advance
meant
death
,
and
no
one
dreamed
of
*NL*
retreating
;
for
the
other
,
to
remain
meant
death
,
and
no
one
dreamed
of
*NL*
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indispensable
that
all
should
be
ended
on
the
following
day
,
that
*NL*
triumph
should
rest
either
here
or
there
,
that
the
insurrection
should
*NL*
prove
itself
a
revolution
or
a
skirmish
.
The
Government
understood
this
*NL*
as
well
as
the
parties
;
the
most
insignificant
bourgeois
felt
it
.
Hence
*NL*
a
thought
of
anguish
which
mingled
with
the
impenetrable
gloom
of
this
*NL*
quarter
where
all
was
at
the
point
of
being
decided
;
hence
a
redoubled
*NL*
anxiety
around
that
silence
whence
a
catastrophe
was
on
the
point
of
*NL*
emerging
.
Here
only
one
sound
was
audible
,
a
sound
as
heart-rending
*NL*
as
the
death
rattle
,
as
menacing
as
a
malediction
,
the
tocsin
of
*NL*
Saint-Merry
.
Nothing
could
be
more
blood-curdling
than
the
clamor
of
*NL*
that
wild
and
desperate
bell
,
wailing
amid
the
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
often
happens
,
nature
seemed
to
have
fallen
into
accord
with
what
*NL*
men
were
about
to
do
.
Nothing
disturbed
the
harmony
of
the
whole
effect
.
*NL*
The
stars
had
disappeared
,
heavy
clouds
filled
the
horizon
with
their
*NL*
melancholy
folds
.
A
black
sky
rested
on
these
dead
streets
,
as
though
an
*NL*
immense
winding-sheet
were
being
outspread
over
this
immense
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
a
battle
that
was
still
wholly
political
was
in
preparation
in
the
*NL*
same
locality
which
had
already
witnessed
so
many
revolutionary
events
,
*NL*
while
youth
,
the
secret
associations
,
the
schools
,
in
the
name
of
*NL*
principles
,
and
the
middle
classes
,
in
the
name
of
interests
,
were
*NL*
approaching
preparatory
to
dashing
themselves
together
,
clasping
and
*NL*
throwing
each
other
,
while
each
one
hastened
and
invited
the
last
and
*NL*
decisive
hour
of
the
crisis
,
far
away
and
quite
outside
of
this
fatal
*NL*
quarter
,
in
the
most
profound
depths
of
the
unfathomable
cavities
of
*NL*
that
wretched
old
Paris
which
disappears
under
the
splendor
of
happy
*NL*
and
opulent
Paris
,
the
sombre
voice
of
the
people
could
be
heard
giving
*NL*
utterance
to
a
dull
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fearful
and
sacred
voice
which
is
composed
of
the
roar
of
the
brute
*NL*
and
of
the
word
of
God
,
which
terrifies
the
weak
and
which
warns
the
*NL*
wise
,
which
comes
both
from
below
like
the
voice
of
the
lion
,
and
from
*NL*
on
high
like
the
voice
of
the
thunder
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
EXTREME
EDGE
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
reached
the
Halles
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
everything
was
still
calmer
,
more
obscure
and
more
motionless
than
*NL*
in
the
neighboring
streets
.
One
would
have
said
that
the
glacial
peace
*NL*
of
the
sepulchre
had
sprung
forth
from
the
earth
and
had
spread
over
the
*NL*
heavens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
a
red
glow
brought
out
against
this
black
background
the
*NL*
lofty
roofs
of
the
houses
which
barred
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
on
*NL*
the
Saint-Eustache
side
.
It
was
the
reflection
of
the
torch
which
was
*NL*
burning
in
the
Corinthe
barricade
.
Marius
directed
his
steps
towards
*NL*
that
red
light
.
It
had
drawn
him
to
the
Marche-aux-Poirees
,
and
he
*NL*
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
dark
mouth
of
the
Rue
des
Precheurs
.
He
entered
*NL*
it
.
The
insurgents
'
sentinel
,
who
was
guarding
the
other
end
,
did
not
*NL*
see
him
.
He
felt
that
he
was
very
close
to
that
which
he
had
come
in
*NL*
search
of
,
and
he
walked
on
tiptoe
.
In
this
manner
he
reached
the
elbow
*NL*
of
that
short
section
of
the
Rue
Mondetour
which
was
,
as
the
reader
will
*NL*
remember
,
the
only
communication
which
Enjolras
had
preserved
with
the
*NL*
outside
world
.
At
the
corner
of
the
last
house
,
on
his
left
,
he
thrust
*NL*
his
head
forward
,
and
looked
into
the
fragment
of
the
Rue
Mondetour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
beyond
the
angle
of
the
lane
and
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
which
*NL*
cast
a
broad
curtain
of
shadow
,
in
which
he
was
himself
engulfed
,
*NL*
he
perceived
some
light
on
the
pavement
,
a
bit
of
the
wine-shop
,
and
*NL*
beyond
,
a
flickering
lamp
within
a
sort
of
shapeless
wall
,
and
men
*NL*
crouching
down
with
guns
on
their
knees
.
All
this
was
ten
fathoms
*NL*
distant
from
him
.
It
was
the
interior
of
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
houses
which
bordered
the
lane
on
the
right
concealed
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
wine-shop
,
the
large
barricade
,
and
the
flag
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
but
a
step
more
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
unhappy
young
man
seated
himself
on
a
post
,
folded
his
arms
,
*NL*
and
fell
to
thinking
about
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
that
heroic
Colonel
Pontmercy
,
who
had
been
so
proud
a
*NL*
soldier
,
who
had
guarded
the
frontier
of
France
under
the
Republic
,
and
*NL*
had
touched
the
frontier
of
Asia
under
Napoleon
,
who
had
beheld
Genoa
,
*NL*
Alexandria
,
Milan
,
Turin
,
Madrid
,
Vienna
,
Dresden
,
Berlin
,
Moscow
,
who
*NL*
had
left
on
all
the
victorious
battle-fields
of
Europe
drops
of
that
*NL*
same
blood
,
which
he
,
Marius
,
had
in
his
veins
,
who
had
grown
gray
*NL*
before
his
time
in
discipline
and
command
,
who
had
lived
with
his
*NL*
sword-belt
buckled
,
his
epaulets
falling
on
his
breast
,
his
cockade
*NL*
blackened
with
powder
,
his
brow
furrowed
with
his
helmet
,
in
barracks
,
*NL*
in
camp
,
in
the
bivouac
,
in
ambulances
,
and
who
,
at
the
expiration
of
*NL*
twenty
years
,
had
returned
from
the
great
wars
with
a
scarred
cheek
,
a
*NL*
smiling
countenance
,
tranquil
,
admirable
,
pure
as
a
child
,
having
done
*NL*
everything
for
France
and
nothing
against
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
that
his
day
had
also
come
now
,
that
his
hour
had
*NL*
struck
,
that
following
his
father
,
he
too
was
about
to
show
himself
*NL*
brave
,
intrepid
,
bold
,
to
run
to
meet
the
bullets
,
to
offer
his
breast
*NL*
to
bayonets
,
to
shed
his
blood
,
to
seek
the
enemy
,
to
seek
death
,
that
*NL*
he
was
about
to
wage
war
in
his
turn
and
descend
to
the
field
of
battle
,
*NL*
and
that
the
field
of
battle
upon
which
he
was
to
descend
was
the
*NL*
street
,
and
that
the
war
in
which
he
was
about
to
engage
was
civil
war
!
*NL*
*NL*
He
beheld
civil
war
laid
open
like
a
gulf
before
him
,
and
into
this
he
*NL*
was
about
to
fall
.
Then
he
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
thought
of
his
father
's
sword
,
which
his
grandfather
had
sold
to
a
*NL*
second-hand
dealer
,
and
which
he
had
so
mournfully
regretted
.
He
said
to
*NL*
himself
that
that
chaste
and
valiant
sword
had
done
well
to
escape
from
*NL*
him
,
and
to
depart
in
wrath
into
the
gloom
;
that
if
it
had
thus
fled
,
it
*NL*
was
because
it
was
intelligent
and
because
it
had
foreseen
the
future
;
*NL*
that
it
had
had
a
presentiment
of
this
rebellion
,
the
war
of
the
*NL*
gutters
,
the
war
of
the
pavements
,
fusillades
through
cellar-windows
,
*NL*
blows
given
and
received
in
the
rear
;
it
was
because
,
coming
from
*NL*
Marengo
and
Friedland
,
it
did
not
wish
to
go
to
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Chanvrerie
;
it
was
because
,
after
what
it
had
done
with
the
father
,
it
*NL*
did
not
wish
to
do
this
for
the
son
!
He
told
himself
that
if
that
sword
*NL*
were
there
,
if
after
taking
possession
of
it
at
his
father
's
pillow
,
*NL*
he
had
dared
to
take
it
and
carry
it
off
for
this
combat
of
darkness
*NL*
between
Frenchmen
in
the
streets
,
it
would
assuredly
have
scorched
his
*NL*
hands
and
burst
out
aflame
before
his
eyes
,
like
the
sword
of
the
angel
!
*NL*
He
told
himself
that
it
was
fortunate
that
it
was
not
there
and
that
*NL*
it
had
disappeared
,
that
that
was
well
,
that
that
was
just
,
that
his
*NL*
grandfather
had
been
the
true
guardian
of
his
father
's
glory
,
and
that
*NL*
it
was
far
better
that
the
colonel
's
sword
should
be
sold
at
auction
,
*NL*
sold
to
the
old-clothes
man
,
thrown
among
the
old
junk
,
than
that
it
*NL*
should
,
to-day
,
wound
the
side
of
his
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
he
fell
to
weeping
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
horrible
.
But
what
was
he
to
do
?
Live
without
Cosette
he
could
*NL*
not
.
Since
she
was
gone
,
he
must
needs
die
.
Had
he
not
given
her
his
*NL*
word
of
honor
that
he
would
die
?
She
had
gone
knowing
that
;
this
meant
*NL*
that
it
pleased
her
that
Marius
should
die
.
And
then
,
it
was
clear
that
*NL*
she
no
longer
loved
him
,
since
she
had
departed
thus
without
warning
,
*NL*
without
a
word
,
without
a
letter
,
although
she
knew
his
address
!
What
*NL*
was
the
good
of
living
,
and
why
should
he
live
now
?
And
then
,
what
!
*NL*
should
he
retreat
after
going
so
far
?
should
he
flee
from
danger
after
*NL*
having
approached
it
?
should
he
slip
away
after
having
come
and
peeped
*NL*
into
the
barricade
?
slip
away
,
all
in
a
tremble
,
saying
:
``
After
all
,
I
*NL*
have
had
enough
of
it
as
it
is
.
I
have
seen
it
,
that
suffices
,
this
is
*NL*
civil
war
,
and
I
shall
take
my
leave
!
''
Should
he
abandon
his
friends
who
*NL*
were
expecting
him
?
Who
were
in
need
of
him
possibly
!
who
were
a
mere
*NL*
handful
against
an
army
!
Should
he
be
untrue
at
once
to
his
love
,
to
*NL*
country
,
to
his
word
?
Should
he
give
to
his
cowardice
the
pretext
of
*NL*
patriotism
?
But
this
was
impossible
,
and
if
the
phantom
of
his
father
*NL*
was
there
in
the
gloom
,
and
beheld
him
retreating
,
he
would
beat
him
on
*NL*
the
loins
with
the
flat
of
his
sword
,
and
shout
to
him
:
``
March
on
,
you
*NL*
poltroon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
a
prey
to
the
conflicting
movements
of
his
thoughts
,
he
dropped
his
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
raised
it
.
A
sort
of
splendid
rectification
had
just
been
*NL*
effected
in
his
mind
.
There
is
a
widening
of
the
sphere
of
thought
which
*NL*
is
peculiar
to
the
vicinity
of
the
grave
;
it
makes
one
see
clearly
to
*NL*
be
near
death
.
The
vision
of
the
action
into
which
he
felt
that
he
*NL*
was
,
perhaps
,
on
the
point
of
entering
,
appeared
to
him
no
more
*NL*
as
lamentable
,
but
as
superb
.
The
war
of
the
street
was
suddenly
*NL*
transfigured
by
some
unfathomable
inward
working
of
his
soul
,
before
the
*NL*
eye
of
his
thought
.
All
the
tumultuous
interrogation
points
of
revery
*NL*
recurred
to
him
in
throngs
,
but
without
troubling
him
.
He
left
none
of
*NL*
them
unanswered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
see
,
why
should
his
father
be
indignant
?
Are
there
not
cases
*NL*
where
insurrection
rises
to
the
dignity
of
duty
?
What
was
there
that
was
*NL*
degrading
for
the
son
of
Colonel
Pontmercy
in
the
combat
which
was
about
*NL*
to
begin
?
It
is
no
longer
Montmirail
nor
Champaubert
;
it
is
something
*NL*
quite
different
.
The
question
is
no
longer
one
of
sacred
territory
,
--
but
*NL*
of
a
holy
idea
.
The
country
wails
,
that
may
be
,
but
humanity
applauds
.
*NL*
But
is
it
true
that
the
country
does
wail
?
France
bleeds
,
but
liberty
*NL*
smiles
;
and
in
the
presence
of
liberty
's
smile
,
France
forgets
her
*NL*
wound
.
And
then
if
we
look
at
things
from
a
still
more
lofty
point
of
*NL*
view
,
why
do
we
speak
of
civil
war
?
*NL*
*NL*
Civil
war
--
what
does
that
mean
?
Is
there
a
foreign
war
?
Is
not
all
war
*NL*
between
men
,
war
between
brothers
?
War
is
qualified
only
by
its
object
.
*NL*
There
is
no
such
thing
as
foreign
or
civil
war
;
there
is
only
just
and
*NL*
unjust
war
.
Until
that
day
when
the
grand
human
agreement
is
concluded
,
*NL*
war
,
that
at
least
which
is
the
effort
of
the
future
,
which
is
hastening
*NL*
on
against
the
past
,
which
is
lagging
in
the
rear
,
may
be
necessary
.
*NL*
What
have
we
to
reproach
that
war
with
?
War
does
not
become
a
disgrace
,
*NL*
the
sword
does
not
become
a
disgrace
,
except
when
it
is
used
for
*NL*
assassinating
the
right
,
progress
,
reason
,
civilization
,
truth
.
Then
*NL*
war
,
whether
foreign
or
civil
,
is
iniquitous
;
it
is
called
crime
.
*NL*
Outside
the
pale
of
that
holy
thing
,
justice
,
by
what
right
does
*NL*
one
form
of
man
despise
another
?
By
what
right
should
the
sword
of
*NL*
Washington
disown
the
pike
of
Camille
Desmoulins
?
Leonidas
against
the
*NL*
stranger
,
Timoleon
against
the
tyrant
,
which
is
the
greater
?
the
one
is
*NL*
the
defender
,
the
other
the
liberator
.
Shall
we
brand
every
appeal
*NL*
to
arms
within
a
city
's
limits
without
taking
the
object
into
a
*NL*
consideration
?
Then
note
the
infamy
of
Brutus
,
Marcel
,
Arnould
von
*NL*
Blankenheim
,
Coligny
,
Hedgerow
war
?
War
of
the
streets
?
Why
not
?
That
*NL*
was
the
war
of
Ambiorix
,
of
Artevelde
,
of
Marnix
,
of
Pelagius
.
But
*NL*
Ambiorix
fought
against
Rome
,
Artevelde
against
France
,
Marnix
against
*NL*
Spain
,
Pelagius
against
the
Moors
;
all
against
the
foreigner
.
Well
,
the
*NL*
monarchy
is
a
foreigner
;
oppression
is
a
stranger
;
the
right
divine
is
*NL*
a
stranger
.
Despotism
violates
the
moral
frontier
,
an
invasion
violates
*NL*
the
geographical
frontier
.
Driving
out
the
tyrant
or
driving
out
the
*NL*
English
,
in
both
cases
,
regaining
possession
of
one
's
own
territory
.
*NL*
There
comes
an
hour
when
protestation
no
longer
suffices
;
after
*NL*
philosophy
,
action
is
required
;
live
force
finishes
what
the
idea
*NL*
has
sketched
out
;
Prometheus
chained
begins
,
Arostogeiton
ends
;
the
*NL*
encyclopedia
enlightens
souls
,
the
10th
of
August
electrifies
them
.
*NL*
After
AEschylus
,
Thrasybulus
;
after
Diderot
,
Danton
.
Multitudes
have
*NL*
a
tendency
to
accept
the
master
.
Their
mass
bears
witness
to
apathy
.
*NL*
A
crowd
is
easily
led
as
a
whole
to
obedience
.
Men
must
be
stirred
up
,
*NL*
pushed
on
,
treated
roughly
by
the
very
benefit
of
their
deliverance
,
*NL*
their
eyes
must
be
wounded
by
the
true
,
light
must
be
hurled
at
them
*NL*
in
terrible
handfuls
.
They
must
be
a
little
thunderstruck
themselves
at
*NL*
their
own
well-being
;
this
dazzling
awakens
them
.
Hence
the
necessity
*NL*
of
tocsins
and
wars
.
Great
combatants
must
rise
,
must
enlighten
nations
*NL*
with
audacity
,
and
shake
up
that
sad
humanity
which
is
covered
*NL*
with
gloom
by
the
right
divine
,
Caesarian
glory
,
force
,
fanaticism
,
*NL*
irresponsible
power
,
and
absolute
majesty
;
a
rabble
stupidly
occupied
in
*NL*
the
contemplation
,
in
their
twilight
splendor
,
of
these
sombre
triumphs
*NL*
of
the
night
.
Down
with
the
tyrant
!
Of
whom
are
you
speaking
?
Do
you
*NL*
call
Louis
Philippe
the
tyrant
?
No
;
no
more
than
Louis
XVI
.
Both
of
them
*NL*
are
what
history
is
in
the
habit
of
calling
good
kings
;
but
principles
*NL*
are
not
to
be
parcelled
out
,
the
logic
of
the
true
is
rectilinear
,
the
*NL*
peculiarity
of
truth
is
that
it
lacks
complaisance
;
no
concessions
,
*NL*
then
;
all
encroachments
on
man
should
be
repressed
.
There
is
a
divine
*NL*
right
in
Louis
XVI.
,
there
is
because
a
Bourbon
in
Louis
Philippe
;
both
*NL*
represent
in
a
certain
measure
the
confiscation
of
right
,
and
,
in
order
*NL*
to
clear
away
universal
insurrection
,
they
must
be
combated
;
it
must
*NL*
be
done
,
France
being
always
the
one
to
begin
.
When
the
master
falls
*NL*
in
France
,
he
falls
everywhere
.
In
short
,
what
cause
is
more
just
,
and
*NL*
consequently
,
what
war
is
greater
,
than
that
which
re-establishes
*NL*
social
truth
,
restores
her
throne
to
liberty
,
restores
the
people
to
the
*NL*
people
,
restores
sovereignty
to
man
,
replaces
the
purple
on
the
head
of
*NL*
France
,
restores
equity
and
reason
in
their
plenitude
,
suppresses
every
*NL*
germ
of
antagonism
by
restoring
each
one
to
himself
,
annihilates
the
*NL*
obstacle
which
royalty
presents
to
the
whole
immense
universal
concord
,
*NL*
and
places
the
human
race
once
more
on
a
level
with
the
right
?
These
*NL*
wars
build
up
peace
.
An
enormous
fortress
of
prejudices
,
privileges
,
*NL*
superstitions
,
lies
,
exactions
,
abuses
,
violences
,
iniquities
,
and
*NL*
darkness
still
stands
erect
in
this
world
,
with
its
towers
of
hatred
.
*NL*
It
must
be
cast
down
.
This
monstrous
mass
must
be
made
to
crumble
.
To
*NL*
conquer
at
Austerlitz
is
grand
;
to
take
the
Bastille
is
immense
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
one
who
has
not
noticed
it
in
his
own
case
--
the
soul
,
--
and
*NL*
therein
lies
the
marvel
of
its
unity
complicated
with
ubiquity
,
has
*NL*
a
strange
aptitude
for
reasoning
almost
coldly
in
the
most
violent
*NL*
extremities
,
and
it
often
happens
that
heartbroken
passion
and
profound
*NL*
despair
in
the
very
agony
of
their
blackest
monologues
,
treat
subjects
*NL*
and
discuss
theses
.
Logic
is
mingled
with
convulsion
,
and
the
thread
*NL*
of
the
syllogism
floats
,
without
breaking
,
in
the
mournful
storm
of
*NL*
thought
.
This
was
the
situation
of
Marius
'
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
meditated
thus
,
dejected
but
resolute
,
hesitating
in
every
*NL*
direction
,
and
,
in
short
,
shuddering
at
what
he
was
about
to
do
,
his
*NL*
glance
strayed
to
the
interior
of
the
barricade
.
The
insurgents
*NL*
were
here
conversing
in
a
low
voice
,
without
moving
,
and
there
*NL*
was
perceptible
that
quasi-silence
which
marks
the
last
stage
of
*NL*
expectation
.
Overhead
,
at
the
small
window
in
the
third
story
Marius
*NL*
descried
a
sort
of
spectator
who
appeared
to
him
to
be
singularly
*NL*
attentive
.
This
was
the
porter
who
had
been
killed
by
Le
Cabuc
.
Below
,
*NL*
by
the
lights
of
the
torch
,
which
was
thrust
between
the
paving-stones
,
*NL*
this
head
could
be
vaguely
distinguished
.
Nothing
could
be
stranger
,
in
*NL*
that
sombre
and
uncertain
gleam
,
than
that
livid
,
motionless
,
astonished
*NL*
face
,
with
its
bristling
hair
,
its
eyes
fixed
and
staring
,
and
its
*NL*
yawning
mouth
,
bent
over
the
street
in
an
attitude
of
curiosity
.
One
*NL*
would
have
said
that
the
man
who
was
dead
was
surveying
those
who
were
*NL*
about
to
die
.
A
long
trail
of
blood
which
had
flowed
from
that
head
,
*NL*
descended
in
reddish
threads
from
the
window
to
the
height
of
the
first
*NL*
floor
,
where
it
stopped
.

CHAPTER

--
THE
FLAG
:
ACT
FIRST
*NL*
*NL*
As
yet
,
nothing
had
come
.
Ten
o'clock
had
sounded
from
Saint-Merry
.
*NL*
Enjolras
and
Combeferre
had
gone
and
seated
themselves
,
carbines
in
*NL*
hand
,
near
the
outlet
of
the
grand
barricade
.
They
no
longer
addressed
*NL*
each
other
,
they
listened
,
seeking
to
catch
even
the
faintest
and
most
*NL*
distant
sound
of
marching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
in
the
midst
of
the
dismal
calm
,
a
clear
,
gay
,
young
voice
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
come
from
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
rose
and
began
to
sing
*NL*
distinctly
,
to
the
old
popular
air
of
``
By
the
Light
of
the
Moon
,
''
this
*NL*
bit
of
poetry
,
terminated
by
a
cry
like
the
crow
of
a
cock
:
--
*NL*
*NL*

nez
est

,
*NL*
Mon

They
pressed
each
other
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
Gavroche
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
warning
us
,
''
said
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
hasty
rush
troubled
the
deserted
street
;
they
beheld
a
being
more
*NL*
agile
than
a
clown
climb
over
the
omnibus
,
and
Gavroche
bounded
into
the
*NL*
barricade
,
all
breathless
,
saying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
gun
!
Here
they
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
electric
quiver
shot
through
the
whole
barricade
,
and
the
sound
of
*NL*
hands
seeking
their
guns
became
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
my
carbine
?
''
said
Enjolras
to
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
a
big
gun
,
''
replied
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
seized
Javert
's
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
sentinels
had
fallen
back
,
and
had
come
in
almost
at
the
same
moment
*NL*
as
Gavroche
.
They
were
the
sentinels
from
the
end
of
the
street
,
and
the
*NL*
vidette
of
the
Rue
de
la
Petite-Truanderie
.
The
vidette
of
the
Lane
des
*NL*
Precheurs
had
remained
at
his
post
,
which
indicated
that
nothing
was
*NL*
approaching
from
the
direction
of
the
bridges
and
Halles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
of
which
a
few
paving-stones
alone
were
dimly
*NL*
visible
in
the
reflection
of
the
light
projected
on
the
flag
,
offered
*NL*
to
the
insurgents
the
aspect
of
a
vast
black
door
vaguely
opened
into
a
*NL*
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
man
had
taken
up
his
position
for
the
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
Forty-three
insurgents
,
among
whom
were
Enjolras
,
Combeferre
,
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
Bossuet
,
Joly
,
Bahorel
,
and
Gavroche
,
were
kneeling
inside
*NL*
the
large
barricade
,
with
their
heads
on
a
level
with
the
crest
of
the
*NL*
barrier
,
the
barrels
of
their
guns
and
carbines
aimed
on
the
stones
as
*NL*
though
at
loop-holes
,
attentive
,
mute
,
ready
to
fire
.
Six
,
commanded
*NL*
by
Feuilly
,
had
installed
themselves
,
with
their
guns
levelled
at
their
*NL*
shoulders
,
at
the
windows
of
the
two
stories
of
Corinthe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
minutes
passed
thus
,
then
a
sound
of
footsteps
,
measured
,
heavy
,
*NL*
and
numerous
,
became
distinctly
audible
in
the
direction
of
Saint-Leu
.
*NL*
This
sound
,
faint
at
first
,
then
precise
,
then
heavy
and
sonorous
,
*NL*
approached
slowly
,
without
halt
,
without
intermission
,
with
a
tranquil
*NL*
and
terrible
continuity
.
Nothing
was
to
be
heard
but
this
.
It
was
that
*NL*
combined
silence
and
sound
,
of
the
statue
of
the
commander
,
but
this
*NL*
stony
step
had
something
indescribably
enormous
and
multiple
about
it
*NL*
which
awakened
the
idea
of
a
throng
,
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
the
idea
*NL*
of
a
spectre
.
One
thought
one
heard
the
terrible
statue
Legion
marching
*NL*
onward
.
This
tread
drew
near
;
it
drew
still
nearer
,
and
stopped
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
though
the
breathing
of
many
men
could
be
heard
at
the
end
of
*NL*
the
street
.
Nothing
was
to
be
seen
,
however
,
but
at
the
bottom
of
that
*NL*
dense
obscurity
there
could
be
distinguished
a
multitude
of
metallic
*NL*
threads
,
as
fine
as
needles
and
almost
imperceptible
,
which
moved
about
*NL*
like
those
indescribable
phosphoric
networks
which
one
sees
beneath
*NL*
one
's
closed
eyelids
,
in
the
first
mists
of
slumber
at
the
moment
*NL*
when
one
is
dropping
off
to
sleep
.
These
were
bayonets
and
gun-barrels
*NL*
confusedly
illuminated
by
the
distant
reflection
of
the
torch
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pause
ensued
,
as
though
both
sides
were
waiting
.
All
at
once
,
from
the
*NL*
depths
of
this
darkness
,
a
voice
,
which
was
all
the
more
sinister
,
since
*NL*
no
one
was
visible
,
and
which
appeared
to
be
the
gloom
itself
speaking
,
*NL*
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
time
,
the
click
of
guns
,
as
they
were
lowered
into
position
,
*NL*
was
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
replied
in
a
haughty
and
vibrating
tone
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
French
Revolution
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
!
''
shouted
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
empurpled
all
the
facades
in
the
street
as
though
the
door
of
a
*NL*
furnace
had
been
flung
open
,
and
hastily
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fearful
detonation
burst
forth
on
the
barricade
.
The
red
flag
fell
.
*NL*
The
discharge
had
been
so
violent
and
so
dense
that
it
had
cut
the
*NL*
staff
,
that
is
to
say
,
the
very
tip
of
the
omnibus
pole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bullets
which
had
rebounded
from
the
cornices
of
the
houses
penetrated
*NL*
the
barricade
and
wounded
several
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impression
produced
by
this
first
discharge
was
freezing
.
The
attack
*NL*
had
been
rough
,
and
of
a
nature
to
inspire
reflection
in
the
boldest
.
*NL*
It
was
evident
that
they
had
to
deal
with
an
entire
regiment
at
the
very
*NL*
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Comrades
!
''
shouted
Courfeyrac
,
``
let
us
not
waste
our
powder
.
Let
us
*NL*
wait
until
they
are
in
the
street
before
replying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
above
all
,
''
said
Enjolras
,
``
let
us
raise
the
flag
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
picked
up
the
flag
,
which
had
fallen
precisely
at
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
,
the
clatter
of
the
ramrods
in
the
guns
could
be
heard
;
the
*NL*
troops
were
re-loading
their
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
went
on
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
here
with
a
bold
heart
?
Who
will
plant
the
flag
on
the
*NL*
barricade
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
man
responded
.
To
mount
on
the
barricade
at
the
very
moment
when
,
*NL*
without
any
doubt
,
it
was
again
the
object
of
their
aim
,
was
simply
*NL*
death
.
The
bravest
hesitated
to
pronounce
his
own
condemnation
.
Enjolras
*NL*
himself
felt
a
thrill
.
He
repeated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
no
one
volunteer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
II
--
THE
FLAG
:
ACT
SECOND
*NL*
*NL*
Since
they
had
arrived
at
Corinthe
,
and
had
begun
the
construction
of
*NL*
the
barricade
,
no
attention
had
been
paid
to
Father
Mabeuf
.
M.
Mabeuf
*NL*
had
not
quitted
the
mob
,
however
;
he
had
entered
the
ground-floor
of
the
*NL*
wine-shop
and
had
seated
himself
behind
the
counter
.
There
he
had
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
retreated
into
himself
.
He
no
longer
seemed
to
look
or
to
think
.
*NL*
Courfeyrac
and
others
had
accosted
him
two
or
three
times
,
warning
him
*NL*
of
his
peril
,
beseeching
him
to
withdraw
,
but
he
did
not
hear
them
.
*NL*
When
they
were
not
speaking
to
him
,
his
mouth
moved
as
though
he
were
*NL*
replying
to
some
one
,
and
as
soon
as
he
was
addressed
,
his
lips
became
*NL*
motionless
and
his
eyes
no
longer
had
the
appearance
of
being
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
hours
before
the
barricade
was
attacked
,
he
had
assumed
an
*NL*
attitude
which
he
did
not
afterwards
abandon
,
with
both
fists
planted
*NL*
on
his
knees
and
his
head
thrust
forward
as
though
he
were
gazing
over
a
*NL*
precipice
.
Nothing
had
been
able
to
move
him
from
this
attitude
;
it
did
*NL*
not
seem
as
though
his
mind
were
in
the
barricade
.
When
each
had
gone
*NL*
to
take
up
his
position
for
the
combat
,
there
remained
in
the
tap-room
*NL*
where
Javert
was
bound
to
the
post
,
only
a
single
insurgent
with
a
naked
*NL*
sword
,
watching
over
Javert
,
and
himself
,
Mabeuf
.
At
the
moment
of
the
*NL*
attack
,
at
the
detonation
,
the
physical
shock
had
reached
him
and
had
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
awakened
him
;
he
started
up
abruptly
,
crossed
the
room
,
*NL*
and
at
the
instant
when
Enjolras
repeated
his
appeal
:
``
Does
no
one
*NL*
volunteer
?
''
the
old
man
was
seen
to
make
his
appearance
on
the
threshold
*NL*
of
the
wine-shop
.
His
presence
produced
a
sort
of
commotion
in
the
*NL*
different
groups
.
A
shout
went
up
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
voter
!
It
is
the
member
of
the
Convention
!
It
is
the
*NL*
representative
of
the
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
he
did
not
hear
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
strode
straight
up
to
Enjolras
,
the
insurgents
withdrawing
before
him
*NL*
with
a
religious
fear
;
he
tore
the
flag
from
Enjolras
,
who
recoiled
in
*NL*
amazement
and
then
,
since
no
one
dared
to
stop
or
to
assist
him
,
this
*NL*
old
man
of
eighty
,
with
shaking
head
but
firm
foot
,
began
slowly
to
*NL*
ascend
the
staircase
of
paving-stones
arranged
in
the
barricade
.
This
*NL*
was
so
melancholy
and
so
grand
that
all
around
him
cried
:
``
Off
with
your
*NL*
hats
!
''
At
every
step
that
he
mounted
,
it
was
a
frightful
spectacle
;
his
*NL*
white
locks
,
his
decrepit
face
,
his
lofty
,
bald
,
and
wrinkled
brow
,
*NL*
his
amazed
and
open
mouth
,
his
aged
arm
upholding
the
red
banner
,
rose
*NL*
through
the
gloom
and
were
enlarged
in
the
bloody
light
of
the
torch
,
*NL*
and
the
bystanders
thought
that
they
beheld
the
spectre
of
'93
emerging
*NL*
from
the
earth
,
with
the
flag
of
terror
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
reached
the
last
step
,
when
this
trembling
and
terrible
*NL*
phantom
,
erect
on
that
pile
of
rubbish
in
the
presence
of
twelve
hundred
*NL*
invisible
guns
,
drew
himself
up
in
the
face
of
death
and
as
though
*NL*
he
were
more
powerful
than
it
,
the
whole
barricade
assumed
amid
the
*NL*
darkness
,
a
supernatural
and
colossal
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
ensued
one
of
those
silences
which
occur
only
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
prodigies
.
In
the
midst
of
this
silence
,
the
old
man
waved
the
red
flag
*NL*
and
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
live
the
Revolution
!
Long
live
the
Republic
!
Fraternity
!
Equality
!
*NL*
and
Death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Those
in
the
barricade
heard
a
low
and
rapid
whisper
,
like
the
murmur
*NL*
of
a
priest
who
is
despatching
a
prayer
in
haste
.
It
was
probably
the
*NL*
commissary
of
police
who
was
making
the
legal
summons
at
the
other
end
*NL*
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
same
piercing
voice
which
had
shouted
:
``
Who
goes
there
?
''
*NL*
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Retire
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Mabeuf
,
pale
,
haggard
,
his
eyes
lighted
up
with
the
mournful
flame
of
*NL*
aberration
,
raised
the
flag
above
his
head
and
repeated
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
live
the
Republic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
!
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
discharge
,
similar
to
the
first
,
rained
down
upon
the
*NL*
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
man
fell
on
his
knees
,
then
rose
again
,
dropped
the
flag
*NL*
and
fell
backwards
on
the
pavement
,
like
a
log
,
at
full
length
,
with
*NL*
outstretched
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rivulets
of
blood
flowed
beneath
him
.
His
aged
head
,
pale
and
sad
,
*NL*
seemed
to
be
gazing
at
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
those
emotions
which
are
superior
to
man
,
which
make
him
forget
*NL*
even
to
defend
himself
,
seized
upon
the
insurgents
,
and
they
approached
*NL*
the
body
with
respectful
awe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
men
these
regicides
were
!
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
bent
down
to
Enjolras
'
ear
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
for
yourself
alone
,
I
do
not
wish
to
dampen
the
enthusiasm
.
But
*NL*
this
man
was
anything
rather
than
a
regicide
.
I
knew
him
.
His
name
was
*NL*
Father
Mabeuf
.
I
do
not
know
what
was
the
matter
with
him
to-day
.
But
he
*NL*
was
a
brave
blockhead
.
Just
look
at
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
head
of
a
blockhead
and
the
heart
of
a
Brutus
,
''
replied
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
raised
his
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizens
!
This
is
the
example
which
the
old
give
to
the
young
.
We
*NL*
hesitated
,
he
came
!
We
were
drawing
back
,
he
advanced
!
This
is
what
*NL*
those
who
are
trembling
with
age
teach
to
those
who
tremble
with
fear
!
*NL*
This
aged
man
is
august
in
the
eyes
of
his
country
.
He
has
had
a
long
*NL*
life
and
a
magnificent
death
!
Now
,
let
us
place
the
body
under
cover
,
*NL*
that
each
one
of
us
may
defend
this
old
man
dead
as
he
would
his
*NL*
father
living
,
and
may
his
presence
in
our
midst
render
the
barricade
*NL*
impregnable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
of
gloomy
and
energetic
assent
followed
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
bent
down
,
raised
the
old
man
's
head
,
and
fierce
as
he
was
,
he
*NL*
kissed
him
on
the
brow
,
then
,
throwing
wide
his
arms
,
and
handling
this
*NL*
dead
man
with
tender
precaution
,
as
though
he
feared
to
hurt
it
,
he
*NL*
removed
his
coat
,
showed
the
bloody
holes
in
it
to
all
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
our
flag
now
.

CHAPTER
III
--
GAVROCHE
WOULD
HAVE
DONE
BETTER
TO
ACCEPT
ENJOLRAS
'
CARBINE
*NL*
*NL*
They
threw
a
long
black
shawl
of
Widow
Hucheloup
's
over
Father
Mabeuf
.
*NL*
Six
men
made
a
litter
of
their
guns
;
on
this
they
laid
the
body
,
and
*NL*
bore
it
,
with
bared
heads
,
with
solemn
slowness
,
to
the
large
table
in
*NL*
the
tap-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
men
,
wholly
absorbed
in
the
grave
and
sacred
task
in
which
they
*NL*
were
engaged
,
thought
no
more
of
the
perilous
situation
in
which
they
*NL*
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
corpse
passed
near
Javert
,
who
was
still
impassive
,
Enjolras
*NL*
said
to
the
spy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
your
turn
presently
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
all
this
time
,
Little
Gavroche
,
who
alone
had
not
quitted
his
*NL*
post
,
but
had
remained
on
guard
,
thought
he
espied
some
men
stealthily
*NL*
approaching
the
barricade
.
All
at
once
he
shouted
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
Enjolras
,
Jean
Prouvaire
,
Combeferre
,
Joly
,
Bahorel
,
*NL*
Bossuet
,
and
all
the
rest
ran
tumultuously
from
the
wine-shop
.
It
was
*NL*
almost
too
late
.
They
saw
a
glistening
density
of
bayonets
undulating
*NL*
above
the
barricade
.
Municipal
guards
of
lofty
stature
were
making
*NL*
their
way
in
,
some
striding
over
the
omnibus
,
others
through
the
cut
,
*NL*
thrusting
before
them
the
urchin
,
who
retreated
,
but
did
not
flee
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
was
critical
.
It
was
that
first
,
redoubtable
moment
of
*NL*
inundation
,
when
the
stream
rises
to
the
level
of
the
levee
and
when
the
*NL*
water
begins
to
filter
through
the
fissures
of
dike
.
A
second
more
and
*NL*
the
barricade
would
have
been
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bahorel
dashed
upon
the
first
municipal
guard
who
was
entering
,
and
*NL*
killed
him
on
the
spot
with
a
blow
from
his
gun
;
the
second
killed
*NL*
Bahorel
with
a
blow
from
his
bayonet
.
Another
had
already
overthrown
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
who
was
shouting
:
``
Follow
me
!
''
The
largest
of
all
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
colossus
,
marched
on
Gavroche
with
his
bayonet
fixed
.
The
urchin
took
in
*NL*
his
arms
Javert
's
immense
gun
,
levelled
it
resolutely
at
the
giant
,
and
*NL*
fired
.
No
discharge
followed
.
Javert
's
gun
was
not
loaded
.
The
municipal
*NL*
guard
burst
into
a
laugh
and
raised
his
bayonet
at
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
bayonet
had
touched
Gavroche
,
the
gun
slipped
from
the
*NL*
soldier
's
grasp
,
a
bullet
had
struck
the
municipal
guardsman
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
forehead
,
and
he
fell
over
on
his
back
.
A
second
bullet
*NL*
struck
the
other
guard
,
who
had
assaulted
Courfeyrac
in
the
breast
,
and
*NL*
laid
him
low
on
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
work
of
Marius
,
who
had
just
entered
the
barricade
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
BARREL
OF
POWDER
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
still
concealed
in
the
turn
of
the
Rue
Mondetour
,
had
witnessed
,
*NL*
shuddering
and
irresolute
,
the
first
phase
of
the
combat
.
But
he
had
not
*NL*
long
been
able
to
resist
that
mysterious
and
sovereign
vertigo
which
may
*NL*
be
designated
as
the
call
of
the
abyss
.
In
the
presence
of
the
imminence
*NL*
of
the
peril
,
in
the
presence
of
the
death
of
M.
Mabeuf
,
that
melancholy
*NL*
enigma
,
in
the
presence
of
Bahorel
killed
,
and
Courfeyrac
shouting
:
*NL*
``
Follow
me
!
''
of
that
child
threatened
,
of
his
friends
to
succor
or
to
*NL*
avenge
,
all
hesitation
had
vanished
,
and
he
had
flung
himself
into
the
*NL*
conflict
,
his
two
pistols
in
hand
.
With
his
first
shot
he
had
saved
*NL*
Gavroche
,
and
with
the
second
delivered
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
sound
of
the
shots
,
amid
the
cries
of
the
assaulted
guards
,
*NL*
the
assailants
had
climbed
the
entrenchment
,
on
whose
summit
Municipal
*NL*
Guards
,
soldiers
of
the
line
and
National
Guards
from
the
suburbs
could
*NL*
now
be
seen
,
gun
in
hand
,
rearing
themselves
to
more
than
half
the
*NL*
height
of
their
bodies
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
already
covered
more
than
two-thirds
of
the
barrier
,
but
they
did
*NL*
not
leap
into
the
enclosure
,
as
though
wavering
in
the
fear
of
some
*NL*
trap
.
They
gazed
into
the
dark
barricade
as
one
would
gaze
into
a
lion
's
*NL*
den
.
The
light
of
the
torch
illuminated
only
their
bayonets
,
their
*NL*
bear-skin
caps
,
and
the
upper
part
of
their
uneasy
and
angry
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
no
longer
any
weapons
;
he
had
flung
away
his
discharged
*NL*
pistols
after
firing
them
;
but
he
had
caught
sight
of
the
barrel
of
*NL*
powder
in
the
tap-room
,
near
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
turned
half
round
,
gazing
in
that
direction
,
a
soldier
took
aim
at
*NL*
him
.
At
the
moment
when
the
soldier
was
sighting
Marius
,
a
hand
was
laid
*NL*
on
the
muzzle
of
the
gun
and
obstructed
it
.
This
was
done
by
some
one
*NL*
who
had
darted
forward
,
--
the
young
workman
in
velvet
trousers
.
The
shot
*NL*
sped
,
traversed
the
hand
and
possibly
,
also
,
the
workman
,
since
he
fell
,
*NL*
but
the
ball
did
not
strike
Marius
.
All
this
,
which
was
rather
to
be
*NL*
apprehended
than
seen
through
the
smoke
,
Marius
,
who
was
entering
the
*NL*
tap-room
,
hardly
noticed
.
Still
,
he
had
,
in
a
confused
way
,
perceived
*NL*
that
gun-barrel
aimed
at
him
,
and
the
hand
which
had
blocked
it
,
and
he
*NL*
had
heard
the
discharge
.
But
in
moments
like
this
,
the
things
which
one
*NL*
sees
vacillate
and
are
precipitated
,
and
one
pauses
for
nothing
.
One
*NL*
feels
obscurely
impelled
towards
more
darkness
still
,
and
all
is
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurgents
,
surprised
but
not
terrified
,
had
rallied
.
Enjolras
had
*NL*
shouted
:
``
Wait
!
Do
n't
fire
at
random
!
''
In
the
first
confusion
,
they
*NL*
might
,
in
fact
,
wound
each
other
.
The
majority
of
them
had
ascended
*NL*
to
the
window
on
the
first
story
and
to
the
attic
windows
,
whence
they
*NL*
commanded
the
assailants
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
determined
,
with
Enjolras
,
Courfeyrac
,
Jean
Prouvaire
,
and
*NL*
Combeferre
,
had
proudly
placed
themselves
with
their
backs
against
the
*NL*
houses
at
the
rear
,
unsheltered
and
facing
the
ranks
of
soldiers
and
*NL*
guards
who
crowned
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
was
accomplished
without
haste
,
with
that
strange
and
*NL*
threatening
gravity
which
precedes
engagements
.
They
took
aim
,
point
*NL*
blank
,
on
both
sides
:
they
were
so
close
that
they
could
talk
together
*NL*
without
raising
their
voices
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
reached
this
point
where
the
spark
is
on
the
brink
of
*NL*
darting
forth
,
an
officer
in
a
gorget
extended
his
sword
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lay
down
your
arms
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
!
''
replied
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
discharges
took
place
at
the
same
moment
,
and
all
disappeared
in
*NL*
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
acrid
and
stifling
smoke
in
which
dying
and
wounded
lay
with
weak
,
*NL*
dull
groans
.
When
the
smoke
cleared
away
,
the
combatants
on
both
sides
*NL*
could
be
seen
to
be
thinned
out
,
but
still
in
the
same
positions
,
*NL*
reloading
in
silence
.
All
at
once
,
a
thundering
voice
was
heard
,
*NL*
shouting
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
off
with
you
,
or
I
'll
blow
up
the
barricade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
turned
in
the
direction
whence
the
voice
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
entered
the
tap-room
,
and
had
seized
the
barrel
of
powder
,
*NL*
then
he
had
taken
advantage
of
the
smoke
,
and
the
sort
of
obscure
mist
*NL*
which
filled
the
entrenched
enclosure
,
to
glide
along
the
barricade
as
*NL*
far
as
that
cage
of
paving-stones
where
the
torch
was
fixed
.
To
tear
*NL*
it
from
the
torch
,
to
replace
it
by
the
barrel
of
powder
,
to
thrust
the
*NL*
pile
of
stones
under
the
barrel
,
which
was
instantly
staved
in
,
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
horrible
obedience
,
--
all
this
had
cost
Marius
but
the
time
*NL*
necessary
to
stoop
and
rise
again
;
and
now
all
,
National
Guards
,
*NL*
Municipal
Guards
,
officers
,
soldiers
,
huddled
at
the
other
extremity
of
*NL*
the
barricade
,
gazed
stupidly
at
him
,
as
he
stood
with
his
foot
on
the
*NL*
stones
,
his
torch
in
his
hand
,
his
haughty
face
illuminated
by
a
fatal
*NL*
resolution
,
drooping
the
flame
of
the
torch
towards
that
redoubtable
*NL*
pile
where
they
could
make
out
the
broken
barrel
of
powder
,
and
giving
*NL*
vent
to
that
startling
cry
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
off
with
you
,
or
I
'll
blow
up
the
barricade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
on
that
barricade
after
the
octogenarian
was
the
vision
of
the
*NL*
young
revolution
after
the
apparition
of
the
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blow
up
the
barricade
!
''
said
a
sergeant
,
``
and
yourself
with
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
retorted
:
``
And
myself
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
dropped
the
torch
towards
the
barrel
of
powder
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
there
was
no
longer
any
one
on
the
barrier
.
The
assailants
,
*NL*
abandoning
their
dead
and
wounded
,
flowed
back
pell-mell
and
in
disorder
*NL*
towards
the
extremity
of
the
street
,
and
there
were
again
lost
in
the
*NL*
night
.
It
was
a
headlong
flight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barricade
was
free
.

CHAPTER

--
END
OF
THE
VERSES
OF
JEAN
PROUVAIRE
*NL*
*NL*
All
flocked
around
Marius
.
Courfeyrac
flung
himself
on
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
luck
!
''
said
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
came
in
opportunely
!
''
ejaculated
Bossuet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
not
been
for
you
,
I
should
have
been
dead
!
''
began
Courfeyrac
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
not
been
for
you
,
I
should
have
been
gobbled
up
!
''
added
*NL*
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
asked
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
chief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
he
!
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
had
a
furnace
in
his
brain
all
day
long
;
now
it
was
a
*NL*
whirlwind
.
This
whirlwind
which
was
within
him
,
produced
on
him
the
*NL*
effect
of
being
outside
of
him
and
of
bearing
him
away
.
It
seemed
to
him
*NL*
that
he
was
already
at
an
immense
distance
from
life
.
His
two
luminous
*NL*
months
of
joy
and
love
,
ending
abruptly
at
that
frightful
precipice
,
*NL*
Cosette
lost
to
him
,
that
barricade
,
M.
Mabeuf
getting
himself
killed
*NL*
for
the
Republic
,
himself
the
leader
of
the
insurgents
,
--
all
these
*NL*
things
appeared
to
him
like
a
tremendous
nightmare
.
He
was
obliged
to
*NL*
make
a
mental
effort
to
recall
the
fact
that
all
that
surrounded
him
was
*NL*
real
.
Marius
had
already
seen
too
much
of
life
not
to
know
that
nothing
*NL*
is
more
imminent
than
the
impossible
,
and
that
what
it
is
always
*NL*
necessary
to
foresee
is
the
unforeseen
.
He
had
looked
on
at
his
own
*NL*
drama
as
a
piece
which
one
does
not
understand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mists
which
enveloped
his
thoughts
,
he
did
not
recognize
Javert
,
*NL*
who
,
bound
to
his
post
,
had
not
so
much
as
moved
his
head
during
the
*NL*
whole
of
the
attack
on
the
barricade
,
and
who
had
gazed
on
the
revolt
*NL*
seething
around
him
with
the
resignation
of
a
martyr
and
the
majesty
of
*NL*
a
judge
.
Marius
had
not
even
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
assailants
did
not
stir
,
they
could
be
heard
*NL*
marching
and
swarming
through
at
the
end
of
the
street
but
they
did
not
*NL*
venture
into
it
,
either
because
they
were
awaiting
orders
or
because
*NL*
they
were
awaiting
reinforcements
before
hurling
themselves
afresh
on
*NL*
this
impregnable
redoubt
.
The
insurgents
had
posted
sentinels
,
and
some
*NL*
of
them
,
who
were
medical
students
,
set
about
caring
for
the
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
thrown
the
tables
out
of
the
wine-shop
,
with
the
exception
of
*NL*
the
two
tables
reserved
for
lint
and
cartridges
,
and
of
the
one
on
*NL*
which
lay
Father
Mabeuf
;
they
had
added
them
to
the
barricade
,
and
had
*NL*
replaced
them
in
the
tap-room
with
mattresses
from
the
bed
of
the
*NL*
widow
Hucheloup
and
her
servants
.
On
these
mattresses
they
had
laid
the
*NL*
wounded
.
As
for
the
three
poor
creatures
who
inhabited
Corinthe
,
no
one
*NL*
knew
what
had
become
of
them
.
They
were
finally
found
,
however
,
hidden
*NL*
in
the
cellar
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
poignant
emotion
clouded
the
joy
of
the
disencumbered
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
roll
was
called
.
One
of
the
insurgents
was
missing
.
And
who
was
*NL*
it
?
One
of
the
dearest
.
One
of
the
most
valiant
.
Jean
Prouvaire
.
He
*NL*
was
sought
among
the
wounded
,
he
was
not
there
.
He
was
sought
among
the
*NL*
dead
,
he
was
not
there
.
He
was
evidently
a
prisoner
.
Combeferre
said
to
*NL*
Enjolras
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
our
friend
;
we
have
their
agent
.
Are
you
set
on
the
death
of
*NL*
that
spy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Enjolras
;
``
but
less
so
than
on
the
life
of
Jean
*NL*
Prouvaire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
took
place
in
the
tap-room
near
Javert
's
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
resumed
Combeferre
,
``
I
am
going
to
fasten
my
handkerchief
to
*NL*
my
cane
,
and
go
as
a
flag
of
truce
,
to
offer
to
exchange
our
man
for
*NL*
theirs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
said
Enjolras
,
laying
his
hand
on
Combeferre
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
street
there
was
a
significant
clash
of
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
a
manly
voice
shout
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vive
la
France
!
Long
live
France
!
Long
live
the
future
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
recognized
the
voice
of
Prouvaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
passed
,
a
report
rang
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
fell
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
killed
him
,
''
exclaimed
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
glanced
at
Javert
,
and
said
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
friends
have
just
shot
you
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
AGONY
OF
DEATH
AFTER
THE
AGONY
OF
LIFE
*NL*
*NL*
A
peculiarity
of
this
species
of
war
is
,
that
the
attack
of
the
*NL*
barricades
is
almost
always
made
from
the
front
,
and
that
the
assailants
*NL*
generally
abstain
from
turning
the
position
,
either
because
they
*NL*
fear
ambushes
,
or
because
they
are
afraid
of
getting
entangled
in
the
*NL*
tortuous
streets
.
The
insurgents
'
whole
attention
had
been
directed
,
*NL*
therefore
,
to
the
grand
barricade
,
which
was
,
evidently
,
the
spot
always
*NL*
menaced
,
and
there
the
struggle
would
infallibly
recommence
.
But
Marius
*NL*
thought
of
the
little
barricade
,
and
went
thither
.
It
was
deserted
and
*NL*
guarded
only
by
the
fire-pot
which
trembled
between
the
paving-stones
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
Mondetour
alley
,
and
the
branches
of
the
Rue
de
la
Petite
*NL*
Truanderie
and
the
Rue
du
Cygne
were
profoundly
calm
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Marius
was
withdrawing
,
after
concluding
his
inspection
,
he
heard
his
*NL*
name
pronounced
feebly
in
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Marius
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
,
for
he
recognized
the
voice
which
had
called
to
him
two
*NL*
hours
before
through
the
gate
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
the
voice
now
seemed
to
be
nothing
more
than
a
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
about
him
,
but
saw
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
thought
he
had
been
mistaken
,
that
it
was
an
illusion
added
by
*NL*
his
mind
to
the
extraordinary
realities
which
were
clashing
around
*NL*
him
.
He
advanced
a
step
,
in
order
to
quit
the
distant
recess
where
the
*NL*
barricade
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Marius
!
''
repeated
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
he
could
not
doubt
that
he
had
heard
it
distinctly
;
he
looked
*NL*
and
saw
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
your
feet
,
''
said
the
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bent
down
,
and
saw
in
the
darkness
a
form
which
was
dragging
itself
*NL*
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
crawling
along
the
pavement
.
It
was
this
that
had
spoken
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire-pot
allowed
him
to
distinguish
a
blouse
,
torn
trousers
of
*NL*
coarse
velvet
,
bare
feet
,
and
something
which
resembled
a
pool
of
blood
.
*NL*
Marius
indistinctly
made
out
a
pale
head
which
was
lifted
towards
him
*NL*
and
which
was
saying
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
recognize
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eponine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
bent
hastily
down
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
that
unhappy
child
.
She
was
*NL*
dressed
in
men
's
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
come
you
here
?
What
are
you
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
dying
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
words
and
incidents
which
arouse
dejected
beings
.
Marius
cried
*NL*
out
with
a
start
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wounded
!
Wait
,
I
will
carry
you
into
the
room
!
They
will
attend
*NL*
to
you
there
.
Is
it
serious
?
How
must
I
take
hold
of
you
in
order
not
*NL*
to
hurt
you
?
Where
do
you
suffer
?
Help
!
My
God
!
But
why
did
you
come
*NL*
hither
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
tried
to
pass
his
arm
under
her
,
in
order
to
raise
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
uttered
a
feeble
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
hurt
you
?
''
asked
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
only
touched
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
hand
to
Marius
,
and
in
the
middle
of
that
hand
Marius
saw
*NL*
a
black
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
your
hand
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
pierced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierced
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bullet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
see
a
gun
aimed
at
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
a
hand
stopping
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
seized
with
a
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
madness
!
Poor
child
!
But
so
much
the
better
,
if
that
is
all
,
it
is
*NL*
nothing
,
let
me
carry
you
to
a
bed
.
They
will
dress
your
wound
;
one
does
*NL*
not
die
of
a
pierced
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
bullet
traversed
my
hand
,
but
it
came
out
through
my
back
.
It
is
*NL*
useless
to
remove
me
from
this
spot
.
I
will
tell
you
how
you
can
care
*NL*
for
me
better
than
any
surgeon
.
Sit
down
near
me
on
this
stone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
obeyed
;
she
laid
her
head
on
Marius
'
knees
,
and
,
without
looking
at
*NL*
him
,
she
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
How
good
this
is
!
How
comfortable
this
is
!
There
;
I
no
longer
*NL*
suffer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
then
she
turned
her
face
with
an
*NL*
effort
,
and
looked
at
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
,
Monsieur
Marius
?
It
puzzled
me
because
you
entered
*NL*
that
garden
;
it
was
stupid
,
because
it
was
I
who
showed
you
that
house
;
*NL*
and
then
,
I
ought
to
have
said
to
myself
that
a
young
man
like
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
,
and
overstepping
the
sombre
transitions
that
undoubtedly
*NL*
existed
in
her
mind
,
she
resumed
with
a
heartrending
smile
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thought
me
ugly
,
did
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
you
are
lost
!
Now
,
no
one
can
get
out
of
the
barricade
.
It
was
*NL*
I
who
led
you
here
,
by
the
way
!
You
are
going
to
die
,
I
count
upon
that
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
when
I
saw
them
taking
aim
at
you
,
I
put
my
hand
on
the
muzzle
*NL*
of
the
gun
.
How
queer
it
is
!
But
it
was
because
I
wanted
to
die
before
*NL*
you
.
When
I
received
that
bullet
,
I
dragged
myself
here
,
no
one
saw
*NL*
me
,
no
one
picked
me
up
,
I
was
waiting
for
you
,
I
said
:
`
So
he
is
not
*NL*
coming
!
'
Oh
,
if
you
only
knew
.
I
bit
my
blouse
,
I
suffered
so
!
Now
I
am
*NL*
well
.
Do
you
remember
the
day
I
entered
your
chamber
and
when
I
*NL*
looked
at
myself
in
your
mirror
,
and
the
day
when
I
came
to
you
on
the
*NL*
boulevard
near
the
washerwomen
?
How
the
birds
sang
!
That
was
a
long
time
*NL*
ago
.
You
gave
me
a
hundred
sous
,
and
I
said
to
you
:
'
I
do
n't
want
your
*NL*
money
.
'
I
hope
you
picked
up
your
coin
?
You
are
not
rich
.
I
did
not
*NL*
think
to
tell
you
to
pick
it
up
.
The
sun
was
shining
bright
,
and
it
was
*NL*
not
cold
.
Do
you
remember
,
Monsieur
Marius
?
Oh
!
How
happy
I
am
!
Every
*NL*
one
is
going
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
mad
,
grave
,
and
heart-breaking
air
.
Her
torn
blouse
disclosed
*NL*
her
bare
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
talked
,
she
pressed
her
pierced
hand
to
her
breast
,
where
there
*NL*
was
another
hole
,
and
whence
there
spurted
from
moment
to
moment
a
*NL*
stream
of
blood
,
like
a
jet
of
wine
from
an
open
bung-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gazed
at
this
unfortunate
creature
with
profound
compassion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
resumed
,
``
it

She
caught
up
her
blouse
and
bit
it
,
and
her
limbs
stiffened
on
the
*NL*
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
the
young
cock
's
crow
executed
by
little
Gavroche
*NL*
resounded
through
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
had
mounted
a
table
to
load
his
gun
,
and
was
singing
gayly
the
*NL*
song
then
so
popular
:
--

``

Eponine
raised
herself
and
listened
;
then
she
murmured
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
he

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
to
Marius
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My

here

He
must
not
see
me
.
He
would
scold
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
brother

''
inquired
Marius
,
who
was
meditating
in
the
most
bitter
*NL*
and
sorrowful
depths
of
his
heart
on
the
duties
to
the
Thenardiers
which
*NL*
his
father
had
bequeathed
to
him
;
``
who
is
your

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
little
fellow

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
one

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
made
a
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
do
n't
go
away
,
''
said
she
,
``
it
will
not
be
long
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sitting
almost
upright
,
but
her
voice
was
very
low
and
broken
by
*NL*
hiccoughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
intervals
,
the
death
rattle
interrupted
her
.
She
put
her
face
as
near
*NL*
that
of
Marius
as
possible
.
She
added
with
a
strange
expression
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
I
do
not
wish
to
play
you
a
trick

I
have
a

you

I
was
told
to
put
it
in
the
post

I
kept
it
.
I
did
not
want
to
*NL*
have
it
reach
you

But
perhaps
you
will
be
angry
with
me
for
it
when
we
*NL*
meet
again
presently
?
Take
your
letter

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
grasped
Marius
'
hand
convulsively
with
her
pierced
hand
,
but
she
no
*NL*
longer
seemed
to
feel
her
sufferings
.
She
put
Marius
'
hand
in
the
pocket
*NL*
of
her
blouse
.
There
,
in
fact
,
Marius
felt
a
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
took
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
sign
of
satisfaction
and
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
for
my
trouble
,
promise
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
asked
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
She
dropped
her
head
again
on
Marius
'
knees
,
and
her
eyelids
closed
.
He
*NL*
thought
the
poor
soul
had
departed
.
Eponine
remained
motionless
.
All
*NL*
at
once
,
at
the
very
moment
when
Marius
fancied
her
asleep
forever
,
she
*NL*
slowly
opened
her
eyes
in
which
appeared
the
sombre
profundity
of
death
,
*NL*
and
said
to
him
in
a
tone
whose
sweetness
seemed
already
to
proceed
from
*NL*
another
world
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
by
the
way
,
Monsieur
Marius

believe
that

was

tried
to
smile
once
more
and
expired

CHAPTER
VII
--
GAVROCHE
AS
A
PROFOUND
CALCULATOR
OF
DISTANCES
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
kept
his
promise
.
He
dropped
a
kiss
on
that
livid
brow
,
where
the
*NL*
icy
perspiration
stood
in
beads
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
no
infidelity
to
Cosette
;
it
was
a
gentle
and
pensive
farewell
*NL*
to
an
unhappy
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
without
a
tremor
that
he
had
taken
the
letter
which
Eponine
*NL*
had
given
him
.
He
had
immediately
felt
that
it
was
an
event
of
weight
.
*NL*
He
was
impatient
to
read
it
.
The
heart
of
man
is
so
constituted
that
the
*NL*
unhappy
child
had
hardly
closed
her
eyes
when
Marius
began
to
think
of
*NL*
unfolding
this
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
her
gently
on
the
ground
,
and
went
away
.
Something
told
him
that
*NL*
he
could
not
peruse
that
letter
in
the
presence
of
that
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
near
to
a
candle
in
the
tap-room
.
It
was
a
small
note
,
folded
*NL*
and
sealed
with
a
woman
's
elegant
care
.
The
address
was
in
a
woman
's
*NL*
hand
and
ran
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Monsieur
,
Monsieur
Marius
Pontmercy
,
at
M.
Courfeyrac
's
,
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Verrerie
,
No.
16
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
the
seal
and
read
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
,
alas
!
my
father
insists
on
our
setting
out
immediately
.
*NL*
We
shall
be
this
evening

the
Rue

*NL*
In
a

we
shall
be

England
.
COSETTE
.
June
4th
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
innocence
of
their
love
that
Marius
was
not
even
acquainted
*NL*
with
Cosette
's
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
taken
place
may
be
related
in
a
few
words
.
Eponine
had
been
*NL*
the
cause
of
everything
.
After
the
evening
of
the
3d
of
June
she
had
*NL*
cherished
a
double
idea
,
to
defeat
the
projects
of
her
father
and
the
*NL*
ruffians
on
the
house
of
the
Rue
Plumet
,
and
to
separate
Marius
and
*NL*
Cosette
.
She
had
exchanged
rags
with
the
first
young
scamp
she
came
*NL*
across
who
had
thought
it
amusing
to
dress
like
a
woman
,
while
Eponine
*NL*
disguised
herself
like
a
man
.
It
was
she
who
had
conveyed
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
in
the
Champ
de
Mars
the
expressive
warning
:
``
Leave
your
house
.
''
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
,
in
fact
,
returned
home
,
and
had
said
to
Cosette
:
*NL*
``
We
set
out
this
evening
and
we
go
to
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
with
*NL*
Toussaint
.
Next
week
,
we
shall
be
in
London
.
''
Cosette
,
utterly
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
this
unexpected
blow
,
had
hastily
penned
a
couple
of
*NL*
lines
to
Marius
.
But
how
was
she
to
get
the
letter
to
the
post
?
She
*NL*
never
went
out
alone
,
and
Toussaint
,
surprised
at
such
a
commission
,
*NL*
would
certainly
show
the
letter
to
M.
Fauchelevent
.
In
this
dilemma
,
*NL*
Cosette
had
caught
sight
through
the
fence
of
Eponine
in
man
's
clothes
,
*NL*
who
now
prowled
incessantly
around
the
garden
.
Cosette
had
called
to
*NL*
``
this
young
workman
''
and
had
handed
him
five
francs
and
the
letter
,
*NL*
saying
:
``
Carry
this
letter
immediately
to
its
address
.
''
Eponine
had
put
*NL*
the
letter
in
her
pocket
.
The
next
day
,
on
the
5th
of
June
,
she
went
*NL*
to
Courfeyrac
's
quarters
to
inquire
for
Marius
,
not
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
delivering
the
letter
,
but
,
--
a
thing
which
every
jealous
and
loving
soul
*NL*
will
comprehend
,
--
``
to
see
.
''
There
she
had
waited
for
Marius
,
or
at
least
*NL*
for
Courfeyrac
,
still
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
.
When
Courfeyrac
had
*NL*
told
her
:
``
We
are
going
to
the
barricades
,
''
an
idea
flashed
through
her
*NL*
mind
,
to
fling
herself
into
that
death
,
as
she
would
have
done
into
any
*NL*
other
,
and
to
thrust
Marius
into
it
also
.
She
had
followed
Courfeyrac
,
*NL*
had
made
sure
of
the
locality
where
the
barricade
was
in
process
of
*NL*
construction
;
and
,
quite
certain
,
since
Marius
had
received
no
warning
,
*NL*
and
since
she
had
intercepted
the
letter
,
that
he
would
go
at
dusk
to
*NL*
his
trysting
place
for
every
evening
,
she
had
betaken
herself
to
the
Rue
*NL*
Plumet
,
had
there
awaited
Marius
,
and
had
sent
him
,
in
the
name
of
his
*NL*
friends
,
the
appeal
which
would
,
she
thought
,
lead
him
to
the
barricade
.
*NL*
She
reckoned
on
Marius
'
despair
when
he
should
fail
to
find
Cosette
;
she
*NL*
was
not
mistaken
.
She
had
returned
to
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
herself
.
*NL*
What
she
did
there
the
reader
has
just
seen
.
She
died
with
the
tragic
*NL*
joy
of
jealous
hearts
who
drag
the
beloved
being
into
their
own
death
,
*NL*
and
who
say
:
``
No
one
shall
have
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
covered
Cosette
's
letter
with
kisses
.
So
she
loved
him
!
For
one
*NL*
moment
the
idea
occurred
to
him
that
he
ought
not
to
die
now
.
Then
*NL*
he
said
to
himself
:
``
She
is
going
away
.
Her
father
is
taking
her
to
*NL*
England
,
and
my
grandfather
refuses
his
consent
to
the
marriage
.
Nothing
*NL*
is
changed
in
our
fates
.
''
Dreamers
like
Marius
are
subject
to
supreme
*NL*
attacks
of
dejection
,
and
desperate
resolves
are
the
result
.
The
fatigue
*NL*
of
living
is
insupportable
;
death
is
sooner
over
with
.
Then
he
reflected
*NL*
that
he
had
still
two
duties
to
fulfil
:
to
inform
Cosette
of
his
*NL*
death
and
send
her
a
final
farewell
,
and
to
save
from
the
impending
*NL*
catastrophe
which
was
in
preparation
,
that
poor
child
,
Eponine
's
brother
*NL*
and
Thenardier
's
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
pocket-book
about
him
;
the
same
one
which
had
contained
*NL*
the
note-book
in
which
he
had
inscribed
so
many
thoughts
of
love
for
*NL*
Cosette
.
He
tore
out
a
leaf
and
wrote
on
it
a
few
lines
in
pencil
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
marriage
was
impossible
.
I
asked
my
grandfather
,
he
refused
;
I
have
*NL*
no
fortune
,
neither
hast
thou
.
I
hastened
to
thee
,
thou
wert
no
longer
*NL*
there
.
Thou
knowest
the
promise
that
I
gave
thee
,
I
shall
keep
it
.
I
*NL*
die
.
I
love
thee
.
When
thou
readest
this
,
my
soul
will
be
near
thee
,
and
*NL*
thou
wilt
smile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
nothing
wherewith
to
seal
this
letter
,
he
contented
himself
with
*NL*
folding
the
paper
in
four
,
and
added
the
address
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
Mademoiselle
Cosette
Fauchelevent
,
at
M.
Fauchelevent
's
,
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
,
No.
7
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
folded
the
letter
,
he
stood
in
thought
for
a
moment
,
drew
out
*NL*
his
pocket-book
again
,
opened
it
,
and
wrote
,
with
the
same
pencil
,
these
*NL*
four
lines
on
the
first
page
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Marius
Pontmercy

my
body

Filles-du-Calvaire
,

,
in
the
Marais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
pocketbook
back
in
his
pocket
,
then
he
called
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamin
,
at
the
sound
of
Marius
'
voice
,
ran
up
to
him
with
his
merry
*NL*
and
devoted
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
do
something
for
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything

''
said
Gavroche
.
``
Good
God
!
if
it
had
not
been
for
you
,
I
*NL*
should
have
been
done
for

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
this
letter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it

Leave
the
barricade
instantly
''
-LRB-
Gavroche
began
to
scratch
his
*NL*
ear
uneasily
-RRB-
``
and
to-morrow
morning
,
you
will
deliver
it
at
its

's

Rue

No.

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
heroic
child
replied
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
but
!
in
the
meanwhile
the
barricade
will
be
taken
,
and
I
shall
*NL*
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

according

all

appearances

and
will
not
be
taken

to-morrow
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fresh
respite
which
the
assailants
were
granting
to
the
barricade
*NL*
had
,
in
fact
,
been
prolonged
.
It
was
one
of
those
intermissions
which
*NL*
frequently
occur
in
nocturnal
combats
,
which
are
always
followed
by
an
*NL*
increase
of
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Gavroche
,
``
what
if
I
were
to
go
and
carry
your
letter
*NL*
to-morrow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
too
late
.
The
barricade
will
probably
be
blockaded
,
all
*NL*
the
streets
will
be
guarded
,
and
you
will
not
be
able
to
get
out
.
Go
at
*NL*
once

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
could
think
of
no
reply
to
this
,
and
stood
there
in
indecision
,
*NL*
scratching
his
ear
sadly
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
took
the
letter
with
one
of
those
birdlike
movements
*NL*
which
were
common
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
started
off
at
a
run
through
Mondetour
lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
had
occurred
to
Gavroche
which
had
brought
him
to
a
decision
,
*NL*
but
he
had
not
mentioned
it
for
fear
that
Marius
might
offer
some
*NL*
objection
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
idea
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

barely
midnight

comparison
with
the
insurrections
*NL*
of
the
soul
?
Man
is
a
depth
still
greater
than
the
people
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
at
that
very
moment
was
the
prey
of
a
terrible
upheaval
.
Every
sort
of
*NL*
gulf
had
opened
again
within
him
.
He
also
was
trembling
,
like
Paris
,
*NL*
on
the
brink
of
an
obscure
and
formidable
revolution
.
A
few
hours
*NL*
had
sufficed
to
bring
this
about
.
His
destiny
and
his
conscience
had
*NL*
suddenly
been
covered
with
gloom
.
Of
him
also
,
as
well
as
of
Paris
,
it
*NL*
might
have
been
said
:
``
Two
principles
are
face
to
face
.
The
white
angel
*NL*
and
the
black
angel
are
about
to
seize
each
other
on
the
bridge
of
the
*NL*
abyss
.
Which
of
the
two
will
hurl
the
other
over
?
Who
will
carry
the
*NL*
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
evening
preceding
this
same
5th
of
June
,
Jean
Valjean
,
*NL*
accompanied
by
Cosette
and
Toussaint
had
installed
himself
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
.
A
change
awaited
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
not
quitted
the
Rue
Plumet
without
making
an
effort
at
*NL*
resistance
.
For
the
first
time
since
they
had
lived
side
by
side
,
*NL*
Cosette
's
will
and
the
will
of
Jean
Valjean
had
proved
to
be
distinct
,
*NL*
and
had
been
in
opposition
,
at
least
,
if
they
had
not
clashed
.
There
had
*NL*
been
objections
on
one
side
and
inflexibility
on
the
other
.
The
abrupt
*NL*
advice
:
``
Leave
your
house
,
''
hurled
at
Jean
Valjean
by
a
stranger
,
had
*NL*
alarmed
him
to
the
extent
of
rendering
him
peremptory
.
He
thought
that
*NL*
he
had
been
traced
and
followed
.
Cosette
had
been
obliged
to
give
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
had
arrived
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
without
opening
their
lips
,
*NL*
and
without
uttering
a
word
,
each
being
absorbed
in
his
own
personal
*NL*
preoccupation
;
Jean
Valjean
so
uneasy
that
he
did
not
notice
Cosette
's
*NL*
sadness
,
Cosette
so
sad
that
she
did
not
notice
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
uneasiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
taken
Toussaint
with
him
,
a
thing
which
he
had
never
*NL*
done
in
his
previous
absences
.
He
perceived
the
possibility
of
not
*NL*
returning
to
the
Rue
Plumet
,
and
he
could
neither
leave
Toussaint
behind
*NL*
nor
confide
his
secret
to
her
.
Besides
,
he
felt
that
she
was
devoted
and
*NL*
trustworthy
.
Treachery
between
master
and
servant
begins
in
curiosity
.
*NL*
Now
Toussaint
,
as
though
she
had
been
destined
to
be
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
servant
,
was
not
curious
.
She
stammered
in
her
peasant
dialect
of
*NL*
Barneville
:
``
I
am
made
so
;
I
do
my
work
;
the
rest
is
no
affair
of
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
departure
from
the
Rue
Plumet
,
which
had
been
almost
a
flight
,
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
carried
away
nothing
but
the
little
embalmed
valise
,
*NL*
baptized
by
Cosette
``
the
inseparable
.
''
Full
trunks
would
have
required
*NL*
porters
,
and
porters
are
witnesses
.
A
fiacre
had
been
summoned
to
the
*NL*
door
on
the
Rue
de
Babylone
,
and
they
had
taken
their
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
difficulty
that
Toussaint
had
obtained
permission
to
pack
up
*NL*
a
little
linen
and
clothes
and
a
few
toilet
articles
.
Cosette
had
taken
*NL*
only
her
portfolio
and
her
blotting-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
with
a
view
to
augmenting
the
solitude
and
the
mystery
of
*NL*
this
departure
,
had
arranged
to
quit
the
pavilion
of
the
Rue
Plumet
only
*NL*
at
dusk
,
which
had
allowed
Cosette
time
to
write
her
note
to
Marius
.
*NL*
They
had
arrived
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
after
night
had
fully
*NL*
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
gone
to
bed
in
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lodgings
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
were
situated
on
a
back
*NL*
court
,
on
the
second
floor
,
and
were
composed
of
two
sleeping-rooms
,
a
*NL*
dining-room
and
a
kitchen
adjoining
the
dining-room
,
with
a
garret
*NL*
where
there
was
a
folding-bed
,
and
which
fell
to
Toussaint
's
share
.
The
*NL*
dining-room
was
an
antechamber
as
well
,
and
separated
the
two
bedrooms
.
*NL*
The
apartment
was
provided
with
all
necessary
utensils
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
re-acquire
confidence
as
foolishly
as
they
lose
it
;
human
nature
*NL*
is
so
constituted
.
Hardly
had
Jean
Valjean
reached
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
*NL*
Arme
when
his
anxiety
was
lightened
and
by
degrees
dissipated
.
There
*NL*
are
soothing
spots
which
act
in
some
sort
mechanically
on
the
mind
.
*NL*
An
obscure
street
,
peaceable
inhabitants
.
Jean
Valjean
experienced
an
*NL*
indescribable
contagion
of
tranquillity
in
that
alley
of
ancient
Paris
,
*NL*
which
is
so
narrow
that
it
is
barred
against
carriages
by
a
transverse
*NL*
beam
placed
on
two
posts
,
which
is
deaf
and
dumb
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
clamorous
city
,
dimly
lighted
at
mid-day
,
and
is
,
so
to
speak
,
incapable
*NL*
of
emotions
between
two
rows
of
lofty
houses
centuries
old
,
which
hold
*NL*
their
peace
like
ancients
as
they
are
.
There
was
a
touch
of
stagnant
*NL*
oblivion
in
that
street
.
Jean
Valjean
drew
his
breath
once
more
there
.
*NL*
How
could
he
be
found
there
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
care
was
to
place
the
inseparable
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slept
well
.
Night
brings
wisdom
;
we
may
add
,
night
soothes
.
On
the
*NL*
following
morning
he
awoke
in
a
mood
that
was
almost
gay
.
He
thought
the
*NL*
dining-room
charming
,
though
it
was
hideous
,
furnished
with
an
old
round
*NL*
table
,
a
long
sideboard
surmounted
by
a
slanting
mirror
,
a
dilapidated
*NL*
arm-chair
,
and
several
plain
chairs
which
were
encumbered
with
*NL*
Toussaint
's
packages
.
In
one
of
these
packages
Jean
Valjean
's
uniform
of
*NL*
a
National
Guard
was
visible
through
a
rent
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Cosette
,
she
had
had
Toussaint
take
some
broth
to
her
room
,
and
*NL*
did
not
make
her
appearance
until
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
five
o'clock
,
Toussaint
,
who
was
going
and
coming
and
busying
*NL*
herself
with
the
tiny
establishment
,
set
on
the
table
a
cold
chicken
,
*NL*
which
Cosette
,
out
of
deference
to
her
father
,
consented
to
glance
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
Cosette
,
under
the
pretext
of
an
obstinate
sick
headache
,
*NL*
had
bade
Jean
Valjean
good
night
and
had
shut
herself
up
in
her
chamber
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
eaten
a
wing
of
the
chicken
with
a
good
appetite
,
and
*NL*
with
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
having
gradually
recovered
his
serenity
,
*NL*
had
regained
possession
of
his
sense
of
security
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
discussing
this
modest
dinner
,
he
had
,
twice
or
thrice
,
*NL*
noticed
in
a
confused
way
,
Toussaint
's
stammering
words
as
she
said
*NL*
to
him
:
``
Monsieur
,
there
is
something
going
on
,
they
are
fighting
in
*NL*
Paris
.
''
But
absorbed
in
a
throng
of
inward
calculations
,
he
had
paid
no
*NL*
heed
to
it
.
To
tell
the
truth
,
he
had
not
heard
her
.
He
rose
and
began
*NL*
to
pace
from
the
door
to
the
window
and
from
the
window
to
the
door
,
*NL*
growing
ever
more
serene
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
this
calm
,
Cosette
,
his
sole
anxiety
,
recurred
to
his
thoughts
.
Not
*NL*
that
he
was
troubled
by
this
headache
,
a
little
nervous
crisis
,
a
young
*NL*
girl
's
fit
of
sulks
,
the
cloud
of
a
moment
,
there
would
be
nothing
left
*NL*
of
it
in
a
day
or
two
;
but
he
meditated
on
the
future
,
and
,
as
was
his
*NL*
habit
,
he
thought
of
it
with
pleasure
.
After
all
,
he
saw
no
obstacle
to
*NL*
their
happy
life
resuming
its
course
.
At
certain
hours
,
everything
seems
*NL*
impossible
,
at
others
everything
appears
easy
;
Jean
Valjean
was
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
one
of
these
good
hours
.
They
generally
succeed
the
bad
*NL*
ones
,
as
day
follows
night
,
by
virtue
of
that
law
of
succession
and
*NL*
of
contrast
which
lies
at
the
very
foundation
of
nature
,
and
which
*NL*
superficial
minds
call
antithesis
.
In
this
peaceful
street
where
he
had
*NL*
taken
refuge
,
Jean
Valjean
got
rid
of
all
that
had
been
troubling
him
*NL*
for
some
time
past
.
This
very
fact
,
that
he
had
seen
many
shadows
,
made
*NL*
him
begin
to
perceive
a
little
azure
.
To
have
quitted
the
Rue
*NL*
Plumet
without
complications
or
incidents
was
one
good
step
already
*NL*
accomplished
.
Perhaps
it
would
be
wise
to
go
abroad
,
if
only
for
a
few
*NL*
months
,
and
to
set
out
for
London
.
Well
,
they
would
go
.
What
difference
*NL*
did
it
make
to
him
whether
he
was
in
France
or
in
England
,
provided
he
*NL*
had
Cosette
beside
him
?
Cosette
was
his
nation
.
Cosette
sufficed
for
*NL*
his
happiness
;
the
idea
that
he
,
perhaps
,
did
not
suffice
for
Cosette
's
*NL*
happiness
,
that
idea
which
had
formerly
been
the
cause
of
his
fever
*NL*
and
sleeplessness
,
did
not
even
present
itself
to
his
mind
.
He
was
in
a
*NL*
state
of
collapse
from
all
his
past
sufferings
,
and
he
was
fully
entered
*NL*
on
optimism
.
Cosette
was
by
his
side
,
she
seemed
to
be
his
;
an
optical
*NL*
illusion
which
every
one
has
experienced
.
He
arranged
in
his
own
mind
,
*NL*
with
all
sorts
of
felicitous
devices
,
his
departure
for
England
with
*NL*
Cosette
,
and
he
beheld
his
felicity
reconstituted
wherever
he
pleased
,
*NL*
in
the
perspective
of
his
revery
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
paced
to
and
fro
with
long
strides
,
his
glance
suddenly
*NL*
encountered
something
strange
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
inclined
mirror
facing
him
which
surmounted
the
sideboard
,
he
saw
*NL*
the
four
lines
which
follow
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
,
alas
!
my
father
insists
on
our
setting
out
immediately
.
We
*NL*
shall
be
this
evening
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
No.
7
.
In
a
week
we
*NL*
shall
be
in
England
.
COSETTE
.
June
4th
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
halted
,
perfectly
haggard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
on
her
arrival
had
placed
her
blotting-book
on
the
sideboard
in
*NL*
front
of
the
mirror
,
and
,
utterly
absorbed
in
her
agony
of
grief
,
had
*NL*
forgotten
it
and
left
it
there
,
without
even
observing
that
she
had
left
*NL*
it
wide
open
,
and
open
at
precisely
the
page
on
which
she
had
laid
to
*NL*
dry
the
four
lines
which
she
had
penned
,
and
which
she
had
given
in
*NL*
charge
of
the
young
workman
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
The
writing
had
been
*NL*
printed
off
on
the
blotter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mirror
reflected
the
writing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
was
,
what
is
called
in
geometry
,
the
symmetrical
image
;
so
*NL*
that
the
writing
,
reversed
on
the
blotter
,
was
righted
in
the
mirror
and
*NL*
presented
its
natural
appearance
;
and
Jean
Valjean
had
beneath
his
eyes
*NL*
the
letter
written
by
Cosette
to
Marius
on
the
preceding
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
simple
and
withering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stepped
up
to
the
mirror
.
He
read
the
four
lines
again
,
but
*NL*
he
did
not
believe
them
.
They
produced
on
him
the
effect
of
appearing
in
*NL*
a
flash
of
lightning
.
It
was
a
hallucination
,
it
was
impossible
.
It
was
*NL*
not
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
his
perceptions
became
more
precise
;
he
looked
at
*NL*
Cosette
's
blotting-book
,
and
the
consciousness
of
the
reality
returned
*NL*
to
him
.
He
caught
up
the
blotter
and
said
:
``
It
comes
from
there
.
''
*NL*
He
feverishly
examined
the
four
lines
imprinted
on
the
blotter
,
the
*NL*
reversal
of
the
letters
converted
into
an
odd
scrawl
,
and
he
saw
no
*NL*
sense
in
it
.
Then
he
said
to
himself
:
``
But
this
signifies
nothing
;
there
*NL*
is
nothing
written
here
.
''
And
he
drew
a
long
breath
with
inexpressible
*NL*
relief
.
Who
has
not
experienced
those
foolish
joys
in
horrible
instants
?
*NL*
The
soul
does
not
surrender
to
despair
until
it
has
exhausted
all
*NL*
illusions
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
the
blotter
in
his
hand
and
contemplated
it
in
stupid
delight
,
*NL*
almost
ready
to
laugh
at
the
hallucination
of
which
he
had
been
the
*NL*
dupe
.
All
at
once
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
mirror
again
,
and
again
he
*NL*
beheld
the
vision
.
There
were
the
four
lines
outlined
with
inexorable
*NL*
clearness
.
This
time
it
was
no
mirage
.
The
recurrence
of
a
vision
is
a
*NL*
reality
;
it
was
palpable
,
it
was
the
writing
restored
in
the
mirror
.
He
*NL*
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
tottered
,
dropped
the
blotter
,
and
fell
into
the
old
*NL*
arm-chair
beside
the
buffet
,
with
drooping
head
,
and
glassy
eyes
,
in
*NL*
utter
bewilderment
.
He
told
himself
that
it
was
plain
,
that
the
light
of
*NL*
the
world
had
been
eclipsed
forever
,
and
that
Cosette
had
written
that
*NL*
to
some
one
.
Then
he
heard
his
soul
,
which
had
become
terrible
once
*NL*
more
,
give
vent
to
a
dull
roar
in
the
gloom
.
Try
then
the
effect
of
*NL*
taking
from
the
lion
the
dog
which
he
has
in
his
cage
!
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
and
sad
to
say
,
at
that
very
moment
,
Marius
had
not
yet
received
*NL*
Cosette
's
letter
;
chance
had
treacherously
carried
it
to
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
before
delivering
it
to
Marius
.
Up
to
that
day
,
Jean
Valjean
had
not
*NL*
been
vanquished
by
trial
.
He
had
been
subjected
to
fearful
proofs
;
no
*NL*
violence
of
bad
fortune
had
been
spared
him
;
the
ferocity
of
fate
,
armed
*NL*
with
all
vindictiveness
and
all
social
scorn
,
had
taken
him
for
her
prey
*NL*
and
had
raged
against
him
.
He
had
accepted
every
extremity
when
it
had
*NL*
been
necessary
;
he
had
sacrificed
his
inviolability
as
a
reformed
man
,
*NL*
had
yielded
up
his
liberty
,
risked
his
head
,
lost
everything
,
suffered
*NL*
everything
,
and
he
had
remained
disinterested
and
stoical
to
such
a
*NL*
point
that
he
might
have
been
thought
to
be
absent
from
himself
like
a
*NL*
martyr
.
His
conscience
inured
to
every
assault
of
destiny
,
might
have
*NL*
appeared
to
be
forever
impregnable
.
Well
,
any
one
who
had
beheld
his
*NL*
spiritual
self
would
have
been
obliged
to
concede
that
it
weakened
at
*NL*
that
moment
.
It
was
because
,
of
all
the
tortures
which
he
had
undergone
*NL*
in
the
course
of
this
long
inquisition
to
which
destiny
had
doomed
him
,
*NL*
this
was
the
most
terrible
.
Never
had
such
pincers
seized
him
hitherto
.
*NL*
He
felt
the
mysterious
stirring
of
all
his
latent
sensibilities
.
He
felt
*NL*
the
plucking
at
the
strange
chord
.
Alas
!
the
supreme
trial
,
let
us
say
*NL*
rather
,
the
only
trial
,
is
the
loss
of
the
beloved
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
old
Jean
Valjean
certainly
did
not
love
Cosette
otherwise
than
as
*NL*
a
father
;
but
we
have
already
remarked
,
above
,
that
into
this
paternity
*NL*
the
widowhood
of
his
life
had
introduced
all
the
shades
of
love
;
he
*NL*
loved
Cosette
as
his
daughter
,
and
he
loved
her
as
his
mother
,
and
he
*NL*
loved
her
as
his
sister
;
and
,
as
he
had
never
had
either
a
woman
to
*NL*
love
or
a
wife
,
as
nature
is
a
creditor
who
accepts
no
protest
,
that
*NL*
sentiment
also
,
the
most
impossible
to
lose
,
was
mingled
with
the
*NL*
rest
,
vague
,
ignorant
,
pure
with
the
purity
of
blindness
,
unconscious
,
*NL*
celestial
,
angelic
,
divine
;
less
like
a
sentiment
than
like
an
instinct
,
*NL*
less
like
an
instinct
than
like
an
imperceptible
and
invisible
but
real
*NL*
attraction
;
and
love
,
properly
speaking
,
was
,
in
his
immense
tenderness
*NL*
for
Cosette
,
like
the
thread
of
gold
in
the
mountain
,
concealed
and
*NL*
virgin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
recall
the
situation
of
heart
which
we
have
already
*NL*
indicated
.
No
marriage
was
possible
between
them
;
not
even
that
of
*NL*
souls
;
and
yet
,
it
is
certain
that
their
destinies
were
wedded
.
With
the
*NL*
exception
of
Cosette
,
that
is
to
say
,
with
the
exception
of
a
childhood
,
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
never
,
in
the
whole
of
his
long
life
,
known
anything
of
*NL*
that
which
may
be
loved
.
The
passions
and
loves
which
succeed
each
other
*NL*
had
not
produced
in
him
those
successive
green
growths
,
tender
green
or
*NL*
dark
green
,
which
can
be
seen
in
foliage
which
passes
through
the
winter
*NL*
and
in
men
who
pass
fifty
.
In
short
,
and
we
have
insisted
on
it
more
*NL*
than
once
,
all
this
interior
fusion
,
all
this
whole
,
of
which
the
sum
*NL*
total
was
a
lofty
virtue
,
ended
in
rendering
Jean
Valjean
a
father
to
*NL*
Cosette
.
A
strange
father
,
forged
from
the
grandfather
,
the
son
,
the
*NL*
brother
,
and
the
husband
,
that
existed
in
Jean
Valjean
;
a
father
in
whom
*NL*
there
was
included
even
a
mother
;
a
father
who
loved
Cosette
and
adored
*NL*
her
,
and
who
held
that
child
as
his
light
,
his
home
,
his
family
,
his
*NL*
country
,
his
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
when
he
saw
that
the
end
had
absolutely
come
,
that
she
was
escaping
*NL*
from
him
,
that
she
was
slipping
from
his
hands
,
that
she
was
gliding
*NL*
from
him
,
like
a
cloud
,
like
water
,
when
he
had
before
his
eyes
this
*NL*
crushing
proof
:
``
another
is
the
goal
of
her
heart
,
another
is
the
wish
*NL*
of
her
life
;
there
is
a
dearest
one
,
I
am
no
longer
anything
but
her
*NL*
father
,
I
no
longer
exist
''
;
when
he
could
no
longer
doubt
,
when
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
:
``
She
is
going
away
from
me
!
''
the
grief
which
he
felt
*NL*
surpassed
the
bounds
of
possibility
.
To
have
done
all
that
he
had
done
*NL*
for
the
purpose
of
ending
like
this
!
And
the
very
idea
of
being
nothing
!
*NL*
Then
,
as
we
have
just
said
,
a
quiver
of
revolt
ran
through
him
from
*NL*
head
to
foot
.
He
felt
,
even
in
the
very
roots
of
his
hair
,
the
immense
*NL*
reawakening
of
egotism
,
and
the
_
I
_
in
this
man
's
abyss
howled
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
such
a
thing
as
the
sudden
giving
way
of
the
inward
subsoil
.
A
*NL*
despairing
certainty
does
not
make
its
way
into
a
man
without
thrusting
*NL*
aside
and
breaking
certain
profound
elements
which
,
in
some
cases
,
are
*NL*
the
very
man
himself
.
Grief
,
when
it
attains
this
shape
,
is
a
headlong
*NL*
flight
of
all
the
forces
of
the
conscience
.
These
are
fatal
crises
.
Few
*NL*
among
us
emerge
from
them
still
like
ourselves
and
firm
in
duty
.
When
*NL*
the
limit
of
endurance
is
overstepped
,
the
most
imperturbable
virtue
is
*NL*
disconcerted
.
Jean
Valjean
took
the
blotter
again
,
and
convinced
himself
*NL*
afresh
;
he
remained
bowed
and
as
though
petrified
and
with
staring
eyes
,
*NL*
over
those
four
unobjectionable
lines
;
and
there
arose
within
him
such
*NL*
a
cloud
that
one
might
have
thought
that
everything
in
this
soul
was
*NL*
crumbling
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
examined
this
revelation
,
athwart
the
exaggerations
of
revery
,
with
*NL*
an
apparent
and
terrifying
calmness
,
for
it
is
a
fearful
thing
when
a
*NL*
man
's
calmness
reaches
the
coldness
of
the
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
measured
the
terrible
step
which
his
destiny
had
taken
without
his
*NL*
having
a
suspicion
of
the
fact
;
he
recalled
his
fears
of
the
preceding
*NL*
summer
,
so
foolishly
dissipated
;
he
recognized
the
precipice
,
it
was
*NL*
still
the
same
;
only
,
Jean
Valjean
was
no
longer
on
the
brink
,
he
was
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unprecedented
and
heart-rending
thing
about
it
was
that
he
had
*NL*
fallen
without
perceiving
it
.
All
the
light
of
his
life
had
departed
,
*NL*
while
he
still
fancied
that
he
beheld
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
instinct
did
not
hesitate
.
He
put
together
certain
circumstances
,
*NL*
certain
dates
,
certain
blushes
and
certain
pallors
on
Cosette
's
part
,
*NL*
and
he
said
to
himself
:
``
It
is
he
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
divination
of
despair
is
a
sort
of
mysterious
bow
which
never
misses
*NL*
its
aim
.
He
struck
Marius
with
his
first
conjecture
.
He
did
not
know
the
*NL*
name
,
but
he
found
the
man
instantly
.
He
distinctly
perceived
,
in
the
*NL*
background
of
the
implacable
conjuration
of
his
memories
,
the
unknown
*NL*
prowler
of
the
Luxembourg
,
that
wretched
seeker
of
love
adventures
,
that
*NL*
idler
of
romance
,
that
idiot
,
that
coward
,
for
it
is
cowardly
to
come
*NL*
and
make
eyes
at
young
girls
who
have
beside
them
a
father
who
loves
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
he
had
thoroughly
verified
the
fact
that
this
young
man
was
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
this
situation
,
and
that
everything
proceeded
from
that
*NL*
quarter
,
he
,
Jean
Valjean
,
the
regenerated
man
,
the
man
who
had
so
*NL*
labored
over
his
soul
,
the
man
who
had
made
so
many
efforts
to
resolve
*NL*
all
life
,
all
misery
,
and
all
unhappiness
into
love
,
looked
into
his
own
*NL*
breast
and
there
beheld
a
spectre
,
Hate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Great
griefs
contain
something
of
dejection
.
They
discourage
one
with
*NL*
existence
.
The
man
into
whom
they
enter
feels
something
within
him
*NL*
withdraw
from
him
.
In
his
youth
,
their
visits
are
lugubrious
;
later
on
*NL*
they
are
sinister
.
Alas
,
if
despair
is
a
fearful
thing
when
the
blood
is
*NL*
hot
,
when
the
hair
is
black
,
when
the
head
is
erect
on
the
body
like
*NL*
the
flame
on
the
torch
,
when
the
roll
of
destiny
still
retains
its
full
*NL*
thickness
,
when
the
heart
,
full
of
desirable
love
,
still
possesses
beats
*NL*
which
can
be
returned
to
it
,
when
one
has
time
for
redress
,
when
all
*NL*
women
and
all
smiles
and
all
the
future
and
all
the
horizon
are
before
*NL*
one
,
when
the
force
of
life
is
complete
,
what
is
it
in
old
age
,
when
*NL*
the
years
hasten
on
,
growing
ever
paler
,
to
that
twilight
hour
when
one
*NL*
begins
to
behold
the
stars
of
the
tomb
?
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
was
meditating
,
Toussaint
entered
.
Jean
Valjean
rose
and
asked
*NL*
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
quarter
is
it
?
Do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Toussaint
was
struck
dumb
,
and
could
only
answer
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
,
sir
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
began
again
:
``
Did
you
not
tell
me
that
just
now
that
there
*NL*
is
fighting
going
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
yes
,
sir
,
''
replied
Toussaint
.
``
It
is
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Saint-Merry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
mechanical
movement
which
comes
to
us
,
unconsciously
,
from
*NL*
the
most
profound
depths
of
our
thought
.
It
was
,
no
doubt
,
under
*NL*
the
impulse
of
a
movement
of
this
sort
,
and
of
which
he
was
hardly
*NL*
conscious
,
that
Jean
Valjean
,
five
minutes
later
,
found
himself
in
the
*NL*
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bareheaded
,
he
sat
upon
the
stone
post
at
the
door
of
his
house
.
He
*NL*
seemed
to
be
listening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
come
.

*NL*

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
STREET
URCHIN
AN
ENEMY
OF
LIGHT
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
did
he
remain
thus
?
What
was
the
ebb
and
flow
of
this
tragic
*NL*
meditation
?
Did
he
straighten
up
?
Did
he
remain
bowed
?
Had
he
been
*NL*
bent
to
breaking
?
Could
he
still
rise
and
regain
his
footing
in
his
*NL*
conscience
upon
something
solid
?
He
probably
would
not
have
been
able
to
*NL*
tell
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
street
was
deserted
.
A
few
uneasy
bourgeois
,
who
were
rapidly
*NL*
returning
home
,
hardly
saw
him
.
Each
one
for
himself
in
times
of
peril
.
*NL*
The
lamp-lighter
came
as
usual
to
light
the
lantern
which
was
situated
*NL*
precisely
opposite
the
door
of
No.
7
,
and
then
went
away
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
would
not
have
appeared
like
a
living
man
to
any
one
who
had
examined
*NL*
him
in
that
shadow
.
He
sat
there
on
the
post
of
his
door
,
motionless
as
*NL*
a
form
of
ice
.
There
is
congealment
in
despair
.
The
alarm
bells
and
*NL*
a
vague
and
stormy
uproar
were
audible
.
In
the
midst
of
all
these
*NL*
convulsions
of
the
bell
mingled
with
the
revolt
,
the
clock
of
Saint-Paul
*NL*
struck
eleven
,
gravely
and
without
haste
;
for
the
tocsin
is
man
;
the
*NL*
hour
is
God
.
The
passage
of
the
hour
produced
no
effect
on
Jean
Valjean
;
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
did
not
stir
.
Still
,
at
about
that
moment
,
a
brusque
report
*NL*
burst
forth
in
the
direction
of
the
Halles
,
a
second
yet
more
violent
*NL*
followed
;
it
was
probably
that
attack
on
the
barricade
in
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Chanvrerie
which
we
have
just
seen
repulsed
by
Marius
.
At
this
double
*NL*
discharge
,
whose
fury
seemed
augmented
by
the
stupor
of
the
night
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
started
;
he
rose
,
turning
towards
the
quarter
whence
the
noise
*NL*
proceeded
;
then
he
fell
back
upon
the
post
again
,
folded
his
arms
,
and
*NL*
his
head
slowly
sank
on
his
bosom
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
resumed
his
gloomy
dialogue
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
raised
his
eyes
;
some
one
was
walking
in
the
street
,
he
*NL*
heard
steps
near
him
.
He
looked
,
and
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
,
in
*NL*
the
direction
of
the
street
which
ran
into
the
Rue-aux-Archives
,
he
*NL*
perceived
a
young
,
livid
,
and
beaming
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
had
just
arrived
in
the
Rue
l'Homme
Arme
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
was
staring
into
the
air
,
apparently
in
search
of
something
.
He
*NL*
saw
Jean
Valjean
perfectly
well
but
he
took
no
notice
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
after
staring
into
the
air
,
stared
below
;
he
raised
himself
on
*NL*
tiptoe
,
and
felt
of
the
doors
and
windows
of
the
ground
floor
;
they
were
*NL*
all
shut
,
bolted
,
and
padlocked
.
After
having
authenticated
the
fronts
*NL*
of
five
or
six
barricaded
houses
in
this
manner
,
the
urchin
shrugged
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
took
himself
to
task
in
these
terms
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
began
to
stare
into
the
air
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
who
,
an
instant
previously
,
in
his
then
state
of
mind
,
*NL*
would
not
have
spoken
to
or
even
answered
any
one
,
felt
irresistibly
*NL*
impelled
to
accost
that
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
with
you
,
my
little
fellow
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
matter
with
me
is
that
I
am
hungry
,
''
replied
Gavroche
frankly
.
And
*NL*
he
added
:
``
Little
fellow
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
fumbled
in
his
fob
and
pulled
out
a
five-franc
piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Gavroche
,
who
was
of
the
wagtail
species
,
and
who
skipped
*NL*
vivaciously
from
one
gesture
to
another
,
had
just
picked
up
a
stone
.
He
*NL*
had
caught
sight
of
the
lantern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
still
have
your
lanterns
here
.
You
are
*NL*
disobeying
the
regulations
,
my
friend
.
This
is
disorderly
.
Smash
that
*NL*
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
flung
the
stone
at
the
lantern
,
whose
broken
glass
fell
with
*NL*
such
a
clatter
that
the
bourgeois
in
hiding
behind
their
curtains
in
the
*NL*
opposite
house
cried
:
``
There
is
`
Ninety-three
'
come
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lantern
oscillated
violently
,
and
went
out
.
The
street
had
suddenly
*NL*
become
black
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
right
,
old
street
,
''
ejaculated
Gavroche
,
``
put
on
your
*NL*
night-cap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
to
Jean
Valjean
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
that
gigantic
monument
that
you
have
there
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
street
?
It
's
the
Archives
,
is
n't
it
?
I
must
crumble
up
those
big
*NL*
stupids
of
pillars
a
bit
and
make
a
nice
barricade
out
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stepped
up
to
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
creature
,
''
he
said
in
a
low
tone
,
and
speaking
to
himself
,
``
he
is
*NL*
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
laid
the
hundred-sou
piece
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
raised
his
face
,
astonished
at
the
size
of
this
sou
;
he
stared
*NL*
at
it
in
the
darkness
,
and
the
whiteness
of
the
big
sou
dazzled
him
.
*NL*
He
knew
five-franc
pieces
by
hearsay
;
their
reputation
was
agreeable
to
*NL*
him
;
he
was
delighted
to
see
one
close
to
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
contemplate
the
tiger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gazed
at
it
for
several
minutes
in
ecstasy
;
then
,
turning
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
he
held
out
the
coin
to
him
,
and
said
majestically
to
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bourgeois
,
I
prefer
to
smash
lanterns
.
Take
back
your
ferocious
beast
.
*NL*
You
ca
n't
bribe
me
.
That
has
got
five
claws
;
but
it
does
n't
scratch
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
a
mother
?
''
asked
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
you
have
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
returned
Jean
Valjean
,
``
keep
the
money
for
your
mother
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
was
touched
.
Moreover
,
he
had
just
noticed
that
the
man
who
was
*NL*
addressing
him
had
no
hat
,
and
this
inspired
him
with
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Truly
,
''
said
he
,
``
so
it
was
n't
to
keep
me
from
breaking
the
lanterns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Break
whatever
you
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
fine
man
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
put
the
five-franc
piece
into
one
of
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
confidence
having
increased
,
he
added
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
belong
in
this
street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
tell
me
where
No.
7
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
with
No.
7
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
child
paused
,
he
feared
that
he
had
said
too
much
;
he
thrust
*NL*
his
nails
energetically
into
his
hair
and
contented
himself
with
*NL*
replying
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
idea
flashed
through
Jean
Valjean
's
mind
.
Anguish
does
have
these
*NL*
gleams
.
He
said
to
the
lad
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
the
person
who
is
bringing
a
letter
that
I
am
expecting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
?
''
said
Gavroche
.
``
You
are
not
a
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
letter
is
for
Mademoiselle
Cosette
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
,
''
muttered
Gavroche
.
``
Yes
,
I
believe
that
is
the
queer
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
resumed
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
am
the
person
to
whom
you
are
to
*NL*
deliver
the
letter
.
Give
it
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
that
case
,
you
must
know
that
I
was
sent
from
the
barricade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
engulfed
his
hand
in
another
of
his
pockets
and
drew
out
a
*NL*
paper
folded
in
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
made
the
military
salute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Respect
for
despatches
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
comes
from
the
Provisional
*NL*
Government
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
held
the
paper
elevated
above
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
and
fancy
it
's
a

It

for

for
*NL*
the
people
.

fight
and
we
respect
the
fair
sex

are
not

to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
continued
Gavroche
,
``
you
have
the
air
of
an
honest
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
it
to
me
quick

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Catch

of

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
handed
the
paper
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
make
haste
,

What
's
-
your-name
,
for
Mamselle
Cosette

*NL*
waiting

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
was
satisfied
with
himself
for
having
produced
this
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
began
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
to
Saint-Merry
that
the
answer
is
to
be
sent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There

''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
Gavroche
took
himself
off
,
or
,
to
describe
it
more
exactly
,
*NL*
fluttered
away
in
the
direction
whence
he
had
come
with
a
flight
like
*NL*
that
of
an
escaped
bird
.
He
plunged
back
into
the
gloom
as
though
he
*NL*
made
a
hole
in
it
,
with
the
rigid
rapidity
of
a
projectile
;
the
alley
of
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
became
silent
and
solitary
once
more
;
in
a
twinkling
,
that
*NL*
strange
child
,
who
had
about
him
something
of
the
shadow
and
of
the
*NL*
dream
,
had
buried
himself
in
the
mists
of
the
rows
of
black
houses
,
and
*NL*
was
lost
there
,
like
smoke
in
the
dark
;
and
one
might
have
thought
that
*NL*
he
had
dissipated
and
vanished
,
had
there
not
taken
place
,
a
few
minutes
*NL*
after
his
disappearance
,
a
startling
shiver
of
glass
,
and
had
not
the
*NL*
magnificent
crash
of
a
lantern
rattling
down
on
the
pavement
once
more
*NL*
abruptly
awakened
the
indignant
bourgeois
.
It
was
Gavroche
upon
his
way
*NL*
through
the
Rue
du
Chaume
.

CHAPTER
III
--
WHILE
COSETTE
AND
TOUSSAINT
ARE
ASLEEP
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
went
into
the
house
with
Marius
'
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
groped
his
way
up
the
stairs
,
as
pleased
with
the
darkness
as
an
owl
*NL*
who
grips
his
prey
,
opened
and
shut
his
door
softly
,
listened
to
see
*NL*
whether
he
could
hear
any
noise
,
--
made
sure
that
,
to
all
appearances
,
*NL*
Cosette
and
Toussaint
were
asleep
,
and
plunged
three
or
four
matches
*NL*
into
the
bottle
of
the
Fumade
lighter
before
he
could
evoke
a
spark
,
so
*NL*
greatly
did
his
hand
tremble
.
What
he
had
just
done
smacked
of
theft
.
At
*NL*
last
the
candle
was
lighted
;
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
unfolded
*NL*
the
paper
,
and
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
violent
emotions
,
one
does
not
read
,
one
flings
to
the
earth
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
,
the
paper
which
one
holds
,
one
clutches
it
like
a
victim
,
one
*NL*
crushes
it
,
one
digs
into
it
the
nails
of
one
's
wrath
,
or
of
one
's
joy
;
*NL*
one
hastens
to
the
end
,
one
leaps
to
the
beginning
;
attention
is
at
*NL*
fever
heat
;
it
takes
up
in
the
gross
,
as
it
were
,
the
essential
points
;
*NL*
it
seizes
on
one
point
,
and
the
rest
disappears
.
In
Marius
'
note
to
*NL*
Cosette
,
Jean
Valjean
saw
only
these
words
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
die
.
When
thou
readest
this
,
my
soul
will
be
near
thee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
presence
of
these
two
lines
,
he
was
horribly
dazzled
;
he
remained
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
crushed
,
as
it
were
,
by
the
change
of
emotion
which
*NL*
was
taking
place
within
him
,
he
stared
at
Marius
'
note
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
intoxicated
amazement
,
he
had
before
his
eyes
that
splendor
,
the
death
*NL*
of
a
hated
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
uttered
a
frightful
cry
of
inward
joy
.
So
it
was
all
over
.
The
*NL*
catastrophe
had
arrived
sooner
than
he
had
dared
to
hope
.
The
being
who
*NL*
obstructed
his
destiny
was
disappearing
.
That
man
had
taken
himself
off
*NL*
of
his
own
accord
,
freely
,
willingly
.
This
man
was
going
to
his
death
,
*NL*
and
he
,
Jean
Valjean
,
had
had
no
hand
in
the
matter
,
and
it
was
through
*NL*
no
fault
of
his
.
Perhaps
,
even
,
he
is
already
dead
.
Here
his
fever
*NL*
entered
into
calculations
.
No
,
he
is
not
dead
yet
.
The
letter
had
*NL*
evidently
been
intended
for
Cosette
to
read
on
the
following
morning
;
*NL*
after
the
two
discharges
that
were
heard
between
eleven
o'clock
and
*NL*
midnight
,
nothing
more
has
taken
place
;
the
barricade
will
not
be
*NL*
attacked
seriously
until
daybreak
;
but
that
makes
no
difference
,
from
*NL*
the
moment
when
``
that
man
''
is
concerned
in
this
war
,
he
is
lost
;
he
is
*NL*
caught
in
the
gearing
.
Jean
Valjean
felt
himself
delivered
.
So
he
was
*NL*
about
to
find
himself
alone
with
Cosette
once
more
.
The
rivalry
would
*NL*
cease
;
the
future
was
beginning
again
.
He
had
but
to
keep
this
note
in
*NL*
his
pocket
.
Cosette
would
never
know
what
had
become
of
that
man
.
All
*NL*
that
there
requires
to
be
done
is
to
let
things
take
their
own
course
.
*NL*
This
man
can
not
escape
.
If
he
is
not
already
dead
,
it
is
certain
that
he
*NL*
is
about
to
die
.
What
good
fortune
!
*NL*
*NL*
Having
said
all
this
to
himself
,
he
became
gloomy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
down
stairs
and
woke
up
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
an
hour
later
,
Jean
Valjean
went
out
in
the
complete
costume
of
*NL*
a
National
Guard
,
and
with
his
arms
.
The
porter
had
easily
found
in
the
*NL*
neighborhood
the
wherewithal
to
complete
his
equipment
.
He
had
a
loaded
*NL*
gun
and
a
cartridge-box
filled
with
cartridges
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
strode
off
in
the
direction
of
the
markets
.

GAVROCHE

EXCESS
OF
ZEAL
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
,
Gavroche
had
had
an
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
after
having
conscientiously
stoned
the
lantern
in
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Chaume
,
entered
the
Rue
des
Vielles-Haudriettes
,
and
not
seeing
``
even
a
*NL*
cat
''
there
,
he
thought
the
opportunity
a
good
one
to
strike
up
all
the
*NL*
song
of
which
he
was
capable
.
His
march
,
far
from
being
retarded
by
his
*NL*
singing
,
was
accelerated
by
it
.
He
began
to
sow
along
the
sleeping
or
*NL*
terrified
houses
these
incendiary
couplets
:

Gavroche
,
as
he
sang
,
was
lavish
of
his
pantomime

Gesture
is
the
strong
*NL*
point
of
the
refrain

His
face

an
inexhaustible
repertory

*NL*
produced
grimaces
more
convulsing

more
fantastic
than
the
rents

Unfortunately

alone

this
was

romance
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
feline
eye
had
just
descried
,
in
the
recess
of
a
carriage
door
,
*NL*
what
is
called
in
painting
,
an
ensemble
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
person
and
*NL*
a
thing
;
the
thing
was
a
hand-cart
,
the
person
was
a
man
from
Auvergene
*NL*
who
was
sleeping
therein
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shafts
of
the
cart
rested
on
the
pavement
,
and
the
Auvergnat
's
head
*NL*
was
supported
against
the
front
of
the
cart
.
His
body
was
coiled
up
on
*NL*
this
inclined
plane
and
his
feet
touched
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
with
his
experience
of
the
things
of
this
world
,
recognized
*NL*
a
drunken
man
.
He
was
some
corner
errand-man
who
had
drunk
too
much
and
*NL*
was
sleeping
too
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
thought
Gavroche
,
``
that
's
what
the
summer
nights
are
good
*NL*
for
.
We
'll
take
the
cart
for
the
Republic
,
and
leave
the
Auvergnat
for
*NL*
the
Monarchy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
had
just
been
illuminated
by
this
flash
of
light
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
bully
that
cart
would
look
on
our
barricade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Auvergnat
was
snoring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
gently
tugged
at
the
cart
from
behind
,
and
at
the
Auvergnat
*NL*
from
the
front
,
that
is
to
say
,
by
the
feet
,
and
at
the
expiration
of
*NL*
another
minute
the
imperturbable
Auvergnat
was
reposing
flat
on
the
*NL*
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cart
was
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
,
habituated
to
facing
the
unexpected
in
all
quarters
,
had
*NL*
everything
about
him
.
He
fumbled
in
one
of
his
pockets
,
and
pulled
from
*NL*
it
a
scrap
of
paper
and
a
bit
of
red
pencil
filched
from
some
carpenter
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
wrote
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
French
Republic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Received
thy
cart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
signed
it
:
``
GAVROCHE
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
he
put
the
paper
in
the
pocket
of
the
still
snoring
*NL*
Auvergnat
's
velvet
vest
,
seized
the
cart
shafts
in
both
hands
,
and
set
*NL*
off
in
the
direction
of
the
Halles
,
pushing
the
cart
before
him
at
a
*NL*
hard
gallop
with
a
glorious
and
triumphant
uproar
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
perilous
.
There
was
a
post
at
the
Royal
Printing
Establishment
.
*NL*
Gavroche
did
not
think
of
this
.
This
post
was
occupied
by
the
National
*NL*
Guards
of
the
suburbs
.
The
squad
began
to
wake
up
,
and
heads
were
raised
*NL*
from
camp
beds
.
Two
street
lanterns
broken
in
succession
,
that
ditty
*NL*
sung
at
the
top
of
the
lungs
.
This
was
a
great
deal
for
those
cowardly
*NL*
streets
,
which
desire
to
go
to
sleep
at
sunset
,
and
which
put
the
*NL*
extinguisher
on
their
candles
at
such
an
early
hour
.
For
the
last
hour
,
*NL*
that
boy
had
been
creating
an
uproar
in
that
peaceable
arrondissement
,
*NL*
the
uproar
of
a
fly
in
a
bottle
.
The
sergeant
of
the
banlieue
lent
an
*NL*
ear
.
He
waited
.
He
was
a
prudent
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mad
rattle
of
the
cart
,
filled
to
overflowing
the
possible
measure
*NL*
of
waiting
,
and
decided
the
sergeant
to
make
a
reconnaisance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
whole
band
of
them
there
!
''
said
he
,
``
let
us
proceed
gently
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
clear
that
the
hydra
of
anarchy
had
emerged
from
its
box
and
that
*NL*
it
was
stalking
abroad
through
the
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
sergeant
ventured
out
of
the
post
with
cautious
tread
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
Gavroche
,
pushing
his
cart
in
front
of
him
,
and
at
the
very
*NL*
moment
when
he
was
about
to
turn
into
the
Rue
des
Vielles-Haudriettes
,
*NL*
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
uniform
,
a
shako
,
a
plume
,
and
a
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
second
time
,
he
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
,
''
said
he
,
``
it
's
him
.
Good
day
,
public
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
's
amazement
was
always
brief
and
speedily
thawed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
,
you
rascal
?
''
shouted
the
sergeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizen
,
''
retorted
Gavroche
,
``
I
have
n't
called
you
`
bourgeois
'
yet
.
Why
*NL*
do
you
insult
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
,
you
rogue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
,
''
retorted
Gavroche
,
``
perhaps
you
were
a
man
of
wit
yesterday
,
*NL*
but
you
have
degenerated
this
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ask
you
where
are
you
going
,
you
villain
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
replied
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
prettily
.
Really
,
no
one
would
suppose
you
as
old
as
you
are
.
*NL*
You
ought
to
sell
all
your
hair
at
a
hundred
francs
apiece
.
That
would
*NL*
yield
you
five
hundred
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
are
you
going
?
Where
are
you
going
?
Where
are
you
going
,
bandit
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
retorted
again
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
villainous
words
!
You
must
wipe
your
mouth
better
the
first
time
*NL*
that
they
give
you
suck
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
lowered
his
bayonet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
me
where
you
are
going
,
you
wretch
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
General
,
''
said
Gavroche
``
I
'm
on
my
way
to
look
for
a
doctor
for
my
wife
*NL*
who
is
in
labor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
arms
!
''
shouted
the
sergeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
master-stroke
of
strong
men
consists
in
saving
themselves
by
the
*NL*
very
means
that
have
ruined
them
;
Gavroche
took
in
the
whole
situation
*NL*
at
a
glance
.
It
was
the
cart
which
had
told
against
him
,
it
was
the
*NL*
cart
's
place
to
protect
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
sergeant
was
on
the
point
of
making
his
descent
*NL*
on
Gavroche
,
the
cart
,
converted
into
a
projectile
and
launched
with
all
*NL*
the
latter
's
might
,
rolled
down
upon
him
furiously
,
and
the
sergeant
,
*NL*
struck
full
in
the
stomach
,
tumbled
over
backwards
into
the
gutter
while
*NL*
his
gun
went
off
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
of
the
post
had
rushed
out
pell-mell
at
the
sergeant
's
shout
;
*NL*
the
shot
brought
on
a
general
random
discharge
,
after
which
they
*NL*
reloaded
their
weapons
and
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
blind-man
's
-
buff
musketry
lasted
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
*NL*
killed
several
panes
of
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
Gavroche
,
who
had
retraced
his
steps
at
full
speed
,
*NL*
halted
five
or
six
streets
distant
and
seated
himself
,
panting
,
on
the
*NL*
stone
post
which
forms
the
corner
of
the
Enfants-Rouges
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
panting
for
a
few
minutes
,
he
turned
in
the
direction
where
the
*NL*
fusillade
was
raging
,
lifted
his
left
hand
to
a
level
with
his
nose
and
*NL*
thrust
it
forward
three
times
,
as
he
slapped
the
back
of
his
head
with
*NL*
his
right
hand
;
an
imperious
gesture
in
which
Parisian
street-urchindom
*NL*
has
condensed
French
irony
,
and
which
is
evidently
efficacious
,
since
it
*NL*
has
already
lasted
half
a
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gayety
was
troubled
by
one
bitter
reflection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'm
splitting
with
laughter
,
I
'm
twisting
with
*NL*
delight
,
I
abound
in
joy
,
but
I
'm
losing
my
way
,
I
shall
have
to
take
a
*NL*
roundabout
way
.
If
I
only
reach
the
barricade
in
season
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
he
set
out
again
on
a
run
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
as
he
ran
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
by
the
way
,
where
was
I
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
resumed
his
ditty
,
as
he
plunged
rapidly
through
the
streets
,
and
*NL*
this
is
what
died
away
in
the
gloom
:
--
*NL*
*NL*

The
post
's
recourse
to
arms
was
not
without
result

The

was
*NL*
conquered
,
the
drunken

was
taken
prisoner

The

THE

OF
THE
FAUBOURG
SAINT
ANTOINE
AND
THE
SCYLLA
OF
*NL*
THE
FAUBOURG
DU
TEMPLE
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
most
memorable
barricades
which
the
observer
of
social
maladies
*NL*
can
name
do
not
belong
to
the
period
in
which
the
action
of
this
work
*NL*
is
laid
.
These
two
barricades
,
both
of
them
symbols
,
under
two
different
*NL*
aspects
,
of
a
redoubtable
situation
,
sprang
from
the
earth
at
the
time
*NL*
of
the
fatal
insurrection
of
June
,
1848
,
the
greatest
war
of
the
streets
*NL*
that
history
has
ever
beheld
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happens
that
,
even
contrary
to
principles
,
even
contrary
to
*NL*
liberty
,
equality
,
and
fraternity
,
even
contrary
to
the
universal
vote
,
*NL*
even
contrary
to
the
government
,
by
all
for
all
,
from
the
depths
of
its
*NL*
anguish
,
of
its
discouragements
and
its
destitutions
,
of
its
fevers
,
of
*NL*
its
distresses
,
of
its
miasmas
,
of
its
ignorances
,
of
its
darkness
,
that
*NL*
great
and
despairing
body
,
the
rabble
,
protests
against
,
and
that
the
*NL*
populace
wages
battle
against
,
the
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beggars
attack
the
common
right
;
the
ochlocracy
rises
against
demos
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
melancholy
days
;
for
there
is
always
a
certain
amount
of
night
*NL*
even
in
this
madness
,
there
is
suicide
in
this
duel
,
and
those
words
*NL*
which
are
intended
to
be
insults
--
beggars
,
canaille
,
ochlocracy
,
*NL*
populace
--
exhibit
,
alas
!
rather
the
fault
of
those
who
reign
than
the
*NL*
fault
of
those
who
suffer
;
rather
the
fault
of
the
privileged
than
the
*NL*
fault
of
the
disinherited
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
our
own
part
,
we
never
pronounce
those
words
without
pain
and
*NL*
without
respect
,
for
when
philosophy
fathoms
the
facts
to
which
they
*NL*
correspond
,
it
often
finds
many
a
grandeur
beside
these
miseries
.
Athens
*NL*
was
an
ochlocracy
;
the
beggars
were
the
making
of
Holland
;
the
populace
*NL*
saved
Rome
more
than
once
;
and
the
rabble
followed
Jesus
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
thinker
who
has
not
at
times
contemplated
the
magnificences
*NL*
of
the
lower
classes
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
of
this
rabble
that
Saint
Jerome
was
thinking
,
no
doubt
,
and
of
*NL*
all
these
poor
people
and
all
these
vagabonds
and
all
these
miserable
*NL*
people
whence
sprang
the
apostles
and
the
martyrs
,
when
he
uttered
this
*NL*
mysterious
saying
:
``
Fex
urbis
,
lex
orbis
,
''
--
the
dregs
of
the
city
,
the
*NL*
law
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exasperations
of
this
crowd
which
suffers
and
bleeds
,
its
violences
*NL*
contrary
to
all
sense
,
directed
against
the
principles
which
are
its
*NL*
life
,
its
masterful
deeds
against
the
right
,
are
its
popular
coups
*NL*
d'etat
and
should
be
repressed
.
The
man
of
probity
sacrifices
himself
,
*NL*
and
out
of
his
very
love
for
this
crowd
,
he
combats
it
.
But
how
*NL*
excusable
he
feels
it
even
while
holding
out
against
it
!
How
he
*NL*
venerates
it
even
while
resisting
it
!
This
is
one
of
those
rare
moments
*NL*
when
,
while
doing
that
which
it
is
one
's
duty
to
do
,
one
feels
something
*NL*
which
disconcerts
one
,
and
which
would
dissuade
one
from
proceeding
*NL*
further
;
one
persists
,
it
is
necessary
,
but
conscience
,
though
*NL*
satisfied
,
is
sad
,
and
the
accomplishment
of
duty
is
complicated
with
a
*NL*
pain
at
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
June
,
1848
,
let
us
hasten
to
say
,
was
an
exceptional
fact
,
and
almost
*NL*
impossible
of
classification
,
in
the
philosophy
of
history
.
All
the
*NL*
words
which
we
have
just
uttered
,
must
be
discarded
,
when
it
becomes
*NL*
a
question
of
this
extraordinary
revolt
,
in
which
one
feels
the
holy
*NL*
anxiety
of
toil
claiming
its
rights
.
It
was
necessary
to
combat
it
,
and
*NL*
this
was
a
duty
,
for
it
attacked
the
republic
.
But
what
was
June
,
1848
,
*NL*
at
bottom
?
A
revolt
of
the
people
against
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
the
subject
is
not
lost
sight
of
,
there
is
no
digression
;
may
we
,
*NL*
then
,
be
permitted
to
arrest
the
reader
's
attention
for
a
moment
on
the
*NL*
two
absolutely
unique
barricades
of
which
we
have
just
spoken
and
which
*NL*
characterized
this
insurrection
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
blocked
the
entrance
to
the
Faubourg
Saint
Antoine
;
the
other
*NL*
defended
the
approach
to
the
Faubourg
du
Temple
;
those
before
whom
these
*NL*
two
fearful
masterpieces
of
civil
war
reared
themselves
beneath
the
*NL*
brilliant
blue
sky
of
June
,
will
never
forget
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Saint-Antoine
barricade
was
tremendous
;
it
was
three
stories
high
,
*NL*
and
seven
hundred
feet
wide
.
It
barred
the
vast
opening
of
the
faubourg
,
*NL*
that
is
to
say
,
three
streets
,
from
angle
to
angle
;
ravined
,
jagged
,
*NL*
cut
up
,
divided
,
crenelated
,
with
an
immense
rent
,
buttressed
with
piles
*NL*
that
were
bastions
in
themselves
throwing
out
capes
here
and
there
,
*NL*
powerfully
backed
up
by
two
great
promontories
of
houses
of
the
*NL*
faubourg
,
it
reared
itself
like
a
cyclopean
dike
at
the
end
of
the
*NL*
formidable
place
which
had
seen
the
14th
of
July
.
Nineteen
barricades
*NL*
were
ranged
,
one
behind
the
other
,
in
the
depths
of
the
streets
*NL*
behind
this
principal
barricade
.
At
the
very
sight
of
it
,
one
felt
the
*NL*
agonizing
suffering
in
the
immense
faubourg
,
which
had
reached
that
*NL*
point
of
extremity
when
a
distress
may
become
a
catastrophe
.
Of
what
was
*NL*
that
barricade
made
?
Of
the
ruins
of
three
six-story
houses
demolished
*NL*
expressly
,
said
some
.
Of
the
prodigy
of
all
wraths
,
said
others
.
It
wore
*NL*
the
lamentable
aspect
of
all
constructions
of
hatred
,
ruin
.
It
might
be
*NL*
asked
:
Who
built
this
?
It
might
also
be
said
:
Who
destroyed
this
?
It
was
*NL*
the
improvisation
of
the
ebullition
.
Hold
!
take
this
door
!
this
grating
!
*NL*
this
penthouse
!
this
chimney-piece
!
this
broken
brazier
!
this
cracked
*NL*
pot
!
Give
all
!
cast
away
all
!
Push
this
roll
,
dig
,
dismantle
,
overturn
,
*NL*
ruin
everything
!
It
was
the
collaboration
of
the
pavement
,
the
block
of
*NL*
stone
,
the
beam
,
the
bar
of
iron
,
the
rag
,
the
scrap
,
the
broken
pane
,
*NL*
the
unseated
chair
,
the
cabbage-stalk
,
the
tatter
,
the
rag
,
and
the
*NL*
malediction
.
It
was
grand
and
it
was
petty
.
It
was
the
abyss
parodied
*NL*
on
the
public
place
by
hubbub
.
The
mass
beside
the
atom
;
the
strip
of
*NL*
ruined
wall
and
the
broken
bowl
,
--
threatening
fraternization
of
*NL*
every
sort
of
rubbish
.
Sisyphus
had
thrown
his
rock
there
and
Job
his
*NL*
potsherd
.
Terrible
,
in
short
.
It
was
the
acropolis
of
the
barefooted
.
*NL*
Overturned
carts
broke
the
uniformity
of
the
slope
;
an
immense
dray
was
*NL*
spread
out
there
crossways
,
its
axle
pointing
heavenward
,
and
seemed
a
*NL*
scar
on
that
tumultuous
facade
;
an
omnibus
hoisted
gayly
,
by
main
force
,
*NL*
to
the
very
summit
of
the
heap
,
as
though
the
architects
of
this
bit
of
*NL*
savagery
had
wished
to
add
a
touch
of
the
street
urchin
humor
to
their
*NL*
terror
,
presented
its
horseless
,
unharnessed
pole
to
no
one
knows
what
*NL*
horses
of
the
air
.
This
gigantic
heap
,
the
alluvium
of
the
revolt
,
*NL*
figured
to
the
mind
an
Ossa
on
Pelion
of
all
revolutions
;
'93
on
'
89
,
*NL*
the
9th
of
Thermidor
on
the
10th
of
August
,
the
18th
of
Brumaire
on
the
*NL*
11th
of
January
,
Vendemiaire
on
Prairial
,
1848
on
1830
.
The
situation
*NL*
deserved
the
trouble
and
this
barricade
was
worthy
to
figure
on
the
very
*NL*
spot
whence
the
Bastille
had
disappeared
.
If
the
ocean
made
dikes
,
it
*NL*
is
thus
that
it
would
build
.
The
fury
of
the
flood
was
stamped
upon
this
*NL*
shapeless
mass
.
What
flood
?
The
crowd
.
One
thought
one
beheld
hubbub
*NL*
petrified
.
One
thought
one
heard
humming
above
this
barricade
as
though
*NL*
there
had
been
over
their
hive
,
enormous
,
dark
bees
of
violent
progress
.
*NL*
Was
it
a
thicket
?
Was
it
a
bacchanalia
?
Was
it
a
fortress
?
Vertigo
*NL*
seemed
to
have
constructed
it
with
blows
of
its
wings
.
There
was
*NL*
something
of
the
cess-pool
in
that
redoubt
and
something
Olympian
in
*NL*
that
confusion
.
One
there
beheld
in
a
pell-mell
full
of
despair
,
the
*NL*
rafters
of
roofs
,
bits
of
garret
windows
with
their
figured
paper
,
*NL*
window
sashes
with
their
glass
planted
there
in
the
ruins
awaiting
*NL*
the
cannon
,
wrecks
of
chimneys
,
cupboards
,
tables
,
benches
,
howling
*NL*
topsyturveydom
,
and
those
thousand
poverty-stricken
things
,
the
very
*NL*
refuse
of
the
mendicant
,
which
contain
at
the
same
time
fury
and
*NL*
nothingness
.
One
would
have
said
that
it
was
the
tatters
of
a
people
,
*NL*
rags
of
wood
,
of
iron
,
of
bronze
,
of
stone
,
and
that
the
Faubourg
Saint
*NL*
Antoine
had
thrust
it
there
at
its
door
,
with
a
colossal
flourish
of
the
*NL*
broom
making
of
its
misery
its
barricade
.
Blocks
resembling
headsman
's
*NL*
blocks
,
dislocated
chains
,
pieces
of
woodwork
with
brackets
having
*NL*
the
form
of
gibbets
,
horizontal
wheels
projecting
from
the
rubbish
,
*NL*
amalgamated
with
this
edifice
of
anarchy
the
sombre
figure
of
the
old
*NL*
tortures
endured
by
the
people
.
The
barricade
Saint
Antoine
converted
*NL*
everything
into
a
weapon
;
everything
that
civil
war
could
throw
at
the
*NL*
head
of
society
proceeded
thence
;
it
was
not
combat
,
it
was
a
paroxysm
;
*NL*
the
carbines
which
defended
this
redoubt
,
among
which
there
were
some
*NL*
blunderbusses
,
sent
bits
of
earthenware
bones
,
coat-buttons
,
even
the
*NL*
casters
from
night-stands
,
dangerous
projectiles
on
account
of
*NL*
the
brass
.
This
barricade
was
furious
;
it
hurled
to
the
clouds
an
*NL*
inexpressible
clamor
;
at
certain
moments
,
when
provoking
the
army
,
it
*NL*
was
covered
with
throngs
and
tempest
;
a
tumultuous
crowd
of
flaming
*NL*
heads
crowned
it
;
a
swarm
filled
it
;
it
had
a
thorny
crest
of
guns
,
of
*NL*
sabres
,
of
cudgels
,
of
axes
,
of
pikes
and
of
bayonets
;
a
vast
red
flag
*NL*
flapped
in
the
wind
;
shouts
of
command
,
songs
of
attack
,
the
roll
of
*NL*
drums
,
the
sobs
of
women
and
bursts
of
gloomy
laughter
from
the
starving
*NL*
were
to
be
heard
there
.
It
was
huge
and
living
,
and
,
like
the
back
of
an
*NL*
electric
beast
,
there
proceeded
from
it
little
flashes
of
lightning
.
The
*NL*
spirit
of
revolution
covered
with
its
cloud
this
summit
where
rumbled
*NL*
that
voice
of
the
people
which
resembles
the
voice
of
God
;
a
strange
*NL*
majesty
was
emitted
by
this
titanic
basket
of
rubbish
.
It
was
a
heap
of
*NL*
filth
and
it
was
Sinai
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
have
said
previously
,
it
attacked
in
the
name
of
the
*NL*
revolution
--
what
?
The
revolution
.
It
--
that
barricade
,
chance
,
hazard
,
*NL*
disorder
,
terror
,
misunderstanding
,
the
unknown
--
had
facing
it
the
*NL*
Constituent
Assembly
,
the
sovereignty
of
the
people
,
universal
suffrage
,
*NL*
the
nation
,
the
republic
;
and
it
was
the
Carmagnole
bidding
defiance
to
*NL*
the
Marseillaise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immense
but
heroic
defiance
,
for
the
old
faubourg
is
a
hero
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
faubourg
and
its
redoubt
lent
each
other
assistance
.
The
faubourg
*NL*
shouldered
the
redoubt
,
the
redoubt
took
its
stand
under
cover
of
the
*NL*
faubourg
.
The
vast
barricade
spread
out
like
a
cliff
against
which
*NL*
the
strategy
of
the
African
generals
dashed
itself
.
Its
caverns
,
its
*NL*
excrescences
,
its
warts
,
its
gibbosities
,
grimaced
,
so
to
speak
,
and
*NL*
grinned
beneath
the
smoke
.
The
mitraille
vanished
in
shapelessness
;
the
*NL*
bombs
plunged
into
it
;
bullets
only
succeeded
in
making
holes
in
it
;
*NL*
what
was
the
use
of
cannonading
chaos
?
and
the
regiments
,
accustomed
to
*NL*
the
fiercest
visions
of
war
,
gazed
with
uneasy
eyes
on
that
species
of
*NL*
redoubt
,
a
wild
beast
in
its
boar-like
bristling
and
a
mountain
by
its
*NL*
enormous
size
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
a
league
away
,
from
the
corner
of
the
Rue
du
Temple
which
*NL*
debouches
on
the
boulevard
near
the
Chateaud
`
Eau
,
if
one
thrust
one
's
*NL*
head
bodily
beyond
the
point
formed
by
the
front
of
the
Dallemagne
shop
,
*NL*
one
perceived
in
the
distance
,
beyond
the
canal
,
in
the
street
which
*NL*
mounts
the
slopes
of
Belleville
at
the
culminating
point
of
the
rise
,
a
*NL*
strange
wall
reaching
to
the
second
story
of
the
house
fronts
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
hyphen
between
the
houses
on
the
right
and
the
houses
on
the
left
,
as
*NL*
though
the
street
had
folded
back
on
itself
its
loftiest
wall
in
order
*NL*
to
close
itself
abruptly
.
This
wall
was
built
of
paving-stones
.
It
was
*NL*
straight
,
correct
,
cold
,
perpendicular
,
levelled
with
the
square
,
laid
*NL*
out
by
rule
and
line
.
Cement
was
lacking
,
of
course
,
but
,
as
in
the
case
*NL*
of
certain
Roman
walls
,
without
interfering
with
its
rigid
architecture
.
*NL*
The
entablature
was
mathematically
parallel
with
the
base
.
From
distance
*NL*
to
distance
,
one
could
distinguish
on
the
gray
surface
,
almost
invisible
*NL*
loopholes
which
resembled
black
threads
.
These
loopholes
were
separated
*NL*
from
each
other
by
equal
spaces
.
The
street
was
deserted
as
far
as
the
*NL*
eye
could
reach
.
All
windows
and
doors
were
closed
.
In
the
background
*NL*
rose
this
barrier
,
which
made
a
blind
thoroughfare
of
the
street
,
a
*NL*
motionless
and
tranquil
wall
;
no
one
was
visible
,
nothing
was
audible
;
*NL*
not
a
cry
,
not
a
sound
,
not
a
breath
.
A
sepulchre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dazzling
sun
of
June
inundated
this
terrible
thing
with
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
barricade
of
the
Faubourg
of
the
Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
one
arrived
on
the
spot
,
and
caught
sight
of
it
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
,
even
for
the
boldest
,
not
to
become
thoughtful
before
*NL*
this
mysterious
apparition
.
It
was
adjusted
,
jointed
,
imbricated
,
*NL*
rectilinear
,
symmetrical
and
funereal
.
Science
and
gloom
met
there
.
One
*NL*
felt
that
the
chief
of
this
barricade
was
a
geometrician
or
a
spectre
.
*NL*
One
looked
at
it
and
spoke
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
,
if
some
soldier
,
an
officer
or
representative
of
the
*NL*
people
,
chanced
to
traverse
the
deserted
highway
,
a
faint
,
sharp
whistle
*NL*
was
heard
,
and
the
passer-by
fell
dead
or
wounded
,
or
,
if
he
escaped
the
*NL*
bullet
,
sometimes
a
biscaien
was
seen
to
ensconce
itself
in
some
closed
*NL*
shutter
,
in
the
interstice
between
two
blocks
of
stone
,
or
in
the
*NL*
plaster
of
a
wall
.
For
the
men
in
the
barricade
had
made
themselves
two
*NL*
small
cannons
out
of
two
cast-iron
lengths
of
gas-pipe
,
plugged
up
at
*NL*
one
end
with
tow
and
fire-clay
.
There
was
no
waste
of
useless
powder
.
*NL*
Nearly
every
shot
told
.
There
were
corpses
here
and
there
,
and
pools
of
*NL*
blood
on
the
pavement
.
I
remember
a
white
butterfly
which
went
and
came
*NL*
in
the
street
.
Summer
does
not
abdicate
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
neighborhood
,
the
spaces
beneath
the
portes
cocheres
were
*NL*
encumbered
with
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
felt
oneself
aimed
at
by
some
person
whom
one
did
not
see
,
and
one
*NL*
understood
that
guns
were
levelled
at
the
whole
length
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Massed
behind
the
sort
of
sloping
ridge
which
the
vaulted
canal
forms
*NL*
at
the
entrance
to
the
Faubourg
du
Temple
,
the
soldiers
of
the
attacking
*NL*
column
,
gravely
and
thoughtfully
,
watched
this
dismal
redoubt
,
this
*NL*
immobility
,
this
passivity
,
whence
sprang
death
.
Some
crawled
flat
on
*NL*
their
faces
as
far
as
the
crest
of
the
curve
of
the
bridge
,
taking
care
*NL*
that
their
shakos
did
not
project
beyond
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
valiant
Colonel
Monteynard
admired
this
barricade
with
a
*NL*
shudder
.
--
``
How
that
is
built
!
''
he
said
to
a
Representative
.
``
Not
one
*NL*
paving-stone
projects
beyond
its
neighbor
.
It
is
made
of
porcelain
.
''
--
At
*NL*
that
moment
,
a
bullet
broke
the
cross
on
his
breast
,
and
he
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cowards
!
''
people
said
.
``
Let
them
show
themselves
.
Let
us
see
them
!
*NL*
They
dare
not
!
They
are
hiding
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
barricade
of
the
Faubourg
du
Temple
,
defended
by
eighty
men
,
*NL*
attacked
by
ten
thousand
,
held
out
for
three
days
.
On
the
fourth
,
they
*NL*
did
as
at
Zaatcha
,
as
at
Constantine
,
they
pierced
the
houses
,
they
came
*NL*
over
the
roofs
,
the
barricade
was
taken
.
Not
one
of
the
eighty
cowards
*NL*
thought
of
flight
,
all
were
killed
there
with
the
exception
of
the
*NL*
leader
,
Barthelemy
,
of
whom
we
shall
speak
presently
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Saint-Antoine
barricade
was
the
tumult
of
thunders
;
the
barricade
*NL*
of
the
Temple
was
silence
.
The
difference
between
these
two
redoubts
*NL*
was
the
difference
between
the
formidable
and
the
sinister
.
One
seemed
a
*NL*
maw
;
the
other
a
mask
.
*NL*
*NL*
Admitting
that
the
gigantic
and
gloomy
insurrection
of
June
was
composed
*NL*
of
a
wrath
and
of
an
enigma
,
one
divined
in
the
first
barricade
the
*NL*
dragon
,
and
behind
the
second
the
sphinx
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
fortresses
had
been
erected
by
two
men
named
,
the
one
,
*NL*
Cournet
,
the
other
,
Barthelemy
.
Cournet
made
the
Saint-Antoine
*NL*
barricade
;
Barthelemy
the
barricade
of
the
Temple
.
Each
was
the
image
of
*NL*
the
man
who
had
built
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cournet
was
a
man
of
lofty
stature
;
he
had
broad
shoulders
,
a
red
face
,
*NL*
a
crushing
fist
,
a
bold
heart
,
a
loyal
soul
,
a
sincere
and
terrible
eye
.
*NL*
Intrepid
,
energetic
,
irascible
,
stormy
;
the
most
cordial
of
men
,
the
*NL*
most
formidable
of
combatants
.
War
,
strife
,
conflict
,
were
the
very
air
*NL*
he
breathed
and
put
him
in
a
good
humor
.
He
had
been
an
officer
in
the
*NL*
navy
,
and
,
from
his
gestures
and
his
voice
,
one
divined
that
he
sprang
*NL*
from
the
ocean
,
and
that
he
came
from
the
tempest
;
he
carried
the
*NL*
hurricane
on
into
battle
.
With
the
exception
of
the
genius
,
there
was
*NL*
in
Cournet
something
of
Danton
,
as
,
with
the
exception
of
the
divinity
,
*NL*
there
was
in
Danton
something
of
Hercules
.
*NL*
*NL*
Barthelemy
,
thin
,
feeble
,
pale
,
taciturn
,
was
a
sort
of
tragic
street
*NL*
urchin
,
who
,
having
had
his
ears
boxed
by
a
policeman
,
lay
in
wait
for
*NL*
him
,
and
killed
him
,
and
at
seventeen
was
sent
to
the
galleys
.
He
came
*NL*
out
and
made
this
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
on
,
fatal
circumstance
,
in
London
,
proscribed
by
all
,
Barthelemy
*NL*
slew
Cournet
.
It
was
a
funereal
duel
.
Some
time
afterwards
,
caught
in
*NL*
the
gearing
of
one
of
those
mysterious
adventures
in
which
passion
*NL*
plays
a
part
,
a
catastrophe
in
which
French
justice
sees
extenuating
*NL*
circumstances
,
and
in
which
English
justice
sees
only
death
,
Barthelemy
*NL*
was
hanged
.
The
sombre
social
construction
is
so
made
that
,
thanks
to
*NL*
material
destitution
,
thanks
to
moral
obscurity
,
that
unhappy
being
*NL*
who
possessed
an
intelligence
,
certainly
firm
,
possibly
great
,
began
*NL*
in
France
with
the
galleys
,
and
ended
in
England
with
the
gallows
.
*NL*
Barthelemy
,
on
occasion
,
flew
but
one
flag
,
the
black
flag
.

CHAPTER
II
--
WHAT
IS
TO
BE
DONE
IN
THE
ABYSS
IF
ONE
DOES
NOT
CONVERSE
*NL*
*NL*
Sixteen
years
count
in
the
subterranean
education
of
insurrection
,
and
*NL*
June
,
1848
,
knew
a
great
deal
more
about
it
than
June
,
1832
.
So
the
*NL*
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
was
only
an
outline
,
and
an
embryo
*NL*
compared
to
the
two
colossal
barricades
which
we
have
just
sketched
;
but
*NL*
it
was
formidable
for
that
epoch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurgents
under
the
eye
of
Enjolras
,
for
Marius
no
longer
looked
*NL*
after
anything
,
had
made
good
use
of
the
night
.
The
barricade
had
been
*NL*
not
only
repaired
,
but
augmented
.
They
had
raised
it
two
feet
.
Bars
*NL*
of
iron
planted
in
the
pavement
resembled
lances
in
rest
.
All
sorts
of
*NL*
rubbish
brought
and
added
from
all
directions
complicated
the
external
*NL*
confusion
.
The
redoubt
had
been
cleverly
made
over
,
into
a
wall
on
the
*NL*
inside
and
a
thicket
on
the
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
staircase
of
paving-stones
which
permitted
one
to
mount
it
like
the
*NL*
wall
of
a
citadel
had
been
reconstructed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barricade
had
been
put
in
order
,
the
tap-room
disencumbered
,
the
*NL*
kitchen
appropriated
for
the
ambulance
,
the
dressing
of
the
wounded
*NL*
completed
,
the
powder
scattered
on
the
ground
and
on
the
tables
had
been
*NL*
gathered
up
,
bullets
run
,
cartridges
manufactured
,
lint
scraped
,
the
*NL*
fallen
weapons
re-distributed
,
the
interior
of
the
redoubt
cleaned
,
the
*NL*
rubbish
swept
up
,
corpses
removed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
laid
the
dead
in
a
heap
in
the
Mondetour
lane
,
of
which
they
were
*NL*
still
the
masters
.
The
pavement
was
red
for
a
long
time
at
that
spot
.
*NL*
Among
the
dead
there
were
four
National
Guardsmen
of
the
suburbs
.
*NL*
Enjolras
had
their
uniforms
laid
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
had
advised
two
hours
of
sleep
.
Advice
from
Enjolras
was
a
*NL*
command
.
Still
,
only
three
or
four
took
advantage
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feuilly
employed
these
two
hours
in
engraving
this
inscription
on
the
*NL*
wall
which
faced
the
tavern
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
LONG
LIVE
THE
PEOPLES
!
*NL*
*NL*
These
four
words
,
hollowed
out
in
the
rough
stone
with
a
nail
,
could
be
*NL*
still
read
on
the
wall
in
1848
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
women
had
profited
by
the
respite
of
the
night
to
vanish
*NL*
definitely
;
which
allowed
the
insurgents
to
breathe
more
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
found
means
of
taking
refuge
in
some
neighboring
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
greater
part
of
the
wounded
were
able
,
and
wished
,
to
fight
still
.
*NL*
On
a
litter
of
mattresses
and
trusses
of
straw
in
the
kitchen
,
which
had
*NL*
been
converted
into
an
ambulance
,
there
were
five
men
gravely
wounded
,
*NL*
two
of
whom
were
municipal
guardsmen
.
The
municipal
guardsmen
were
*NL*
attended
to
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
tap-room
there
remained
only
Mabeuf
under
his
black
cloth
and
*NL*
Javert
bound
to
his
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
hall
of
the
dead
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
interior
of
this
hall
,
barely
lighted
by
a
candle
at
one
end
,
the
*NL*
mortuary
table
being
behind
the
post
like
a
horizontal
bar
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
vast
,
vague
cross
resulted
from
Javert
erect
and
Mabeuf
lying
prone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pole
of
the
omnibus
,
although
snapped
off
by
the
fusillade
,
was
*NL*
still
sufficiently
upright
to
admit
of
their
fastening
the
flag
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
who
possessed
that
quality
of
a
leader
,
of
always
doing
what
*NL*
he
said
,
attached
to
this
staff
the
bullet-ridden
and
bloody
coat
of
the
*NL*
old
man
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
repast
had
been
possible
.
There
was
neither
bread
nor
meat
.
The
fifty
*NL*
men
in
the
barricade
had
speedily
exhausted
the
scanty
provisions
of
*NL*
the
wine-shop
during
the
sixteen
hours
which
they
had
passed
there
.
At
a
*NL*
given
moment
,
every
barricade
inevitably
becomes
the
raft
of
la
Meduse
.
*NL*
They
were
obliged
to
resign
themselves
to
hunger
.
They
had
then
reached
*NL*
the
first
hours
of
that
Spartan
day
of
the
6th
of
June
when
,
in
the
*NL*
barricade
Saint-Merry
,
Jeanne
,
surrounded
by
the
insurgents
who
demanded
*NL*
bread
,
replied
to
all
combatants
crying
:
``
Something
to
eat
!
''
with
:
``
Why
?
*NL*
It
is
three
o'clock
;
at
four
we
shall
be
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
could
no
longer
eat
,
Enjolras
forbade
them
to
drink
.
He
*NL*
interdicted
wine
,
and
portioned
out
the
brandy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
found
in
the
cellar
fifteen
full
bottles
hermetically
sealed
.
*NL*
Enjolras
and
Combeferre
examined
them
.
Combeferre
when
he
came
up
again
*NL*
said
:
--
``
It
's
the
old
stock
of
Father
Hucheloup
,
who
began
business
as
*NL*
a
grocer
.
''
--
``
It
must
be
real
wine
,
''
observed
Bossuet
.
``
It
's
lucky
that
*NL*
Grantaire
is
asleep
.
If
he
were
on
foot
,
there
would
be
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
difficulty
in
saving
those
bottles
.
''
--
Enjolras
,
in
spite
of
all
murmurs
,
*NL*
placed
his
veto
on
the
fifteen
bottles
,
and
,
in
order
that
no
one
might
*NL*
touch
them
,
he
had
them
placed
under
the
table
on
which
Father
Mabeuf
*NL*
was
lying
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
two
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
they
reckoned
up
their
strength
.
There
*NL*
were
still
thirty-seven
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
began
to
dawn
.
The
torch
,
which
had
been
replaced
in
its
*NL*
cavity
in
the
pavement
,
had
just
been
extinguished
.
The
interior
of
the
*NL*
barricade
,
that
species
of
tiny
courtyard
appropriated
from
the
street
,
*NL*
was
bathed
in
shadows
,
and
resembled
,
athwart
the
vague
,
twilight
*NL*
horror
,
the
deck
of
a
disabled
ship
.
The
combatants
,
as
they
went
*NL*
and
came
,
moved
about
there
like
black
forms
.
Above
that
terrible
*NL*
nesting-place
of
gloom
the
stories
of
the
mute
houses
were
lividly
*NL*
outlined
;
at
the
very
top
,
the
chimneys
stood
palely
out
.
The
sky
was
of
*NL*
that
charming
,
undecided
hue
,
which
may
be
white
and
may
be
blue
.
Birds
*NL*
flew
about
in
it
with
cries
of
joy
.
The
lofty
house
which
formed
the
*NL*
back
of
the
barricade
,
being
turned
to
the
East
,
had
upon
its
roof
a
*NL*
rosy
reflection
.
The
morning
breeze
ruffled
the
gray
hair
on
the
head
of
*NL*
the
dead
man
at
the
third-story
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
delighted
that
the
torch
has
been
extinguished
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
*NL*
to
Feuilly
.
``
That
torch
flickering
in
the
wind
annoyed
me
.
It
had
the
*NL*
appearance
of
being
afraid
.
The
light
of
torches
resembles
the
wisdom
of
*NL*
cowards
;
it
gives
a
bad
light
because
it
trembles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dawn
awakens
minds
as
it
does
the
birds
;
all
began
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joly
,
perceiving
a
cat
prowling
on
a
gutter
,
extracted
philosophy
from
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
cat
?
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
It
is
a
corrective
.
The
good
God
,
*NL*
having
made
the
mouse
,
said
:
`
Hullo
!
I
have
committed
a
blunder
.
'
And
*NL*
so
he
made
the
cat
.
The
cat
is
the
erratum
of
the
mouse
.
The
mouse
,
plus
*NL*
the
cat
,
is
the
proof
of
creation
revised
and
corrected
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Combeferre
,
surrounded
by
students
and
artisans
,
was
speaking
of
the
*NL*
dead
,
of
Jean
Prouvaire
,
of
Bahorel
,
of
Mabeuf
,
and
even
of
Cabuc
,
and
*NL*
of
Enjolras
'
sad
severity
.
He
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Harmodius
and
Aristogiton
,
Brutus
,
Chereas
,
Stephanus
,
Cromwell
,
*NL*
Charlotte
Corday
,
Sand
,
have
all
had
their
moment
of
agony
when
it
was
*NL*
too
late
.
Our
hearts
quiver
so
,
and
human
life
is
such
a
mystery
that
,
*NL*
even
in
the
case
of
a
civic
murder
,
even
in
a
murder
for
liberation
,
if
*NL*
there
be
such
a
thing
,
the
remorse
for
having
struck
a
man
surpasses
the
*NL*
joy
of
having
served
the
human
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
such
are
the
windings
of
the
exchange
of
speech
,
that
,
a
moment
*NL*
later
,
by
a
transition
brought
about
through
Jean
Prouvaire
's
verses
,
*NL*
Combeferre
was
comparing
the
translators
of
the
Georgics
,
Raux
with
*NL*
Cournand
,
Cournand
with
Delille
,
pointing
out
the
passages
translated
*NL*
by
Malfilatre
,
particularly
the
prodigies
of
Caesar
's
death
;
and
at
that
*NL*
word
,
Caesar
,
the
conversation
reverted
to
Brutus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Caesar
,
''
said
Combeferre
,
``
fell
justly
.
Cicero
was
severe
towards
*NL*
Caesar
,
and
he
was
right
.
That
severity
is
not
diatribe
.
When
Zoilus
*NL*
insults
Homer
,
when
Maevius
insults
Virgil
,
when
Vise
insults
Moliere
,
*NL*
when
Pope
insults
Shakspeare
,
when
Frederic
insults
Voltaire
,
it
is
an
*NL*
old
law
of
envy
and
hatred
which
is
being
carried
out
;
genius
attracts
*NL*
insult
,
great
men
are
always
more
or
less
barked
at
.
But
Zoilus
and
*NL*
Cicero
are
two
different
persons
.
Cicero
is
an
arbiter
in
thought
,
just
*NL*
as
Brutus
is
an
arbiter
by
the
sword
.
For
my
own
part
,
I
blame
that
last
*NL*
justice
,
the
blade
;
but
,
antiquity
admitted
it
.
Caesar
,
the
violator
*NL*
of
the
Rubicon
,
conferring
,
as
though
they
came
from
him
,
the
dignities
*NL*
which
emanated
from
the
people
,
not
rising
at
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
senate
,
committed
the
acts
of
a
king
and
almost
of
a
tyrant
,
regia
ac
*NL*
pene
tyrannica
.
He
was
a
great
man
;
so
much
the
worse
,
or
so
much
the
*NL*
better
;
the
lesson
is
but
the
more
exalted
.
His
twenty-three
wounds
*NL*
touch
me
less
than
the
spitting
in
the
face
of
Jesus
Christ
.
Caesar
is
*NL*
stabbed
by
the
senators
;
Christ
is
cuffed
by
lackeys
.
One
feels
the
God
*NL*
through
the
greater
outrage
.

*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
,
who
towered
above
the
interlocutors
from
the
summit
of
a
heap
*NL*
of
paving-stones

exclaimed

rifle

CHAPTER
III
--
LIGHT
AND
SHADOW
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
had
been
to
make
a
reconnaissance
.
He
had
made
his
way
out
*NL*
through
Mondetour
lane
,
gliding
along
close
to
the
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurgents
,
we
will
remark
,
were
full
of
hope
.
The
manner
in
which
*NL*
they
had
repulsed
the
attack
of
the
preceding
night
had
caused
them
to
*NL*
almost
disdain
in
advance
the
attack
at
dawn
.
They
waited
for
it
with
*NL*
a
smile
.
They
had
no
more
doubt
as
to
their
success
than
as
to
their
*NL*
cause
.
Moreover
,
succor
was
,
evidently
,
on
the
way
to
them
.
They
*NL*
reckoned
on
it
.
With
that
facility
of
triumphant
prophecy
which
is
one
*NL*
of
the
sources
of
strength
in
the
French
combatant
,
they
divided
the
*NL*
day
which
was
at
hand
into
three
distinct
phases
.
At
six
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
morning
a
regiment
``
which
had
been
labored
with
,
''
would
turn
;
at
noon
,
*NL*
the
insurrection
of
all
Paris
;
at
sunset
,
revolution
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
heard
the
alarm
bell
of
Saint-Merry
,
which
had
not
been
silent
for
*NL*
an
instant
since
the
night
before
;
a
proof
that
the
other
barricade
,
the
*NL*
great
one
,
Jeanne
's
,
still
held
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
hopes
were
exchanged
between
the
different
groups
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
gay
and
formidable
whisper
which
resembled
the
warlike
hum
of
a
hive
of
*NL*
bees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
reappeared
.
He
returned
from
his
sombre
eagle
flight
into
outer
*NL*
darkness
.
He
listened
for
a
moment
to
all
this
joy
with
folded
arms
,
and
*NL*
one
hand
on
his
mouth
.
Then
,
fresh
and
rosy
in
the
growing
whiteness
of
*NL*
the
dawn
,
he
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
whole
army
of
Paris
is
to
strike
.
A
third
of
the
army
is
bearing
*NL*
down
upon
the
barricades
in
which
you
now
are
.
There
is
the
National
*NL*
Guard
in
addition
.
I
have
picked
out
the
shakos
of
the
fifth
of
the
*NL*
line
,
and
the
standard-bearers
of
the
sixth
legion
.
In
one
hour
you
will
*NL*
be
attacked
.
As
for
the
populace
,
it
was
seething
yesterday
,
to-day
*NL*
it
is
not
stirring
.
There
is
nothing
to
expect
;
nothing
to
hope
for
.
*NL*
Neither
from
a
faubourg
nor
from
a
regiment
.
You
are
abandoned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
fell
upon
the
buzzing
of
the
groups
,
and
produced
on
them
*NL*
the
effect
caused
on
a
swarm
of
bees
by
the
first
drops
of
a
storm
.
A
*NL*
moment
of
indescribable
silence
ensued
,
in
which
death
might
have
been
*NL*
heard
flitting
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
moment
was
brief
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
from
the
obscurest
depths
of
the
groups
shouted
to
Enjolras
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
be
it
.
Let
us
raise
the
barricade
to
a
height
of
twenty
feet
,
and
*NL*
let
us
all
remain
in
it
.
Citizens
,
let
us
offer
the
protests
of
corpses
.
*NL*
Let
us
show
that
,
if
the
people
abandon
the
republicans
,
the
republicans
*NL*
do
not
abandon
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
freed
the
thought
of
all
from
the
painful
cloud
of
*NL*
individual
anxieties
.
It
was
hailed
with
an
enthusiastic
acclamation
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
ever
has
known
the
name
of
the
man
who
spoke
thus
;
he
was
some
*NL*
unknown
blouse-wearer
,
a
stranger
,
a
man
forgotten
,
a
passing
hero
,
that
*NL*
great
anonymous
,
always
mingled
in
human
crises
and
in
social
geneses
*NL*
who
,
at
a
given
moment
,
utters
in
a
supreme
fashion
the
decisive
word
,
*NL*
and
who
vanishes
into
the
shadows
after
having
represented
for
a
minute
,
*NL*
in
a
lightning
flash
,
the
people
and
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
inexorable
resolution
so
thoroughly
impregnated
the
air
of
the
*NL*
6th
of
June
,
1832
,
that
,
almost
at
the
very
same
hour
,
on
the
barricade
*NL*
Saint-Merry
,
the
insurgents
were
raising
that
clamor
which
has
become
a
*NL*
matter
of
history
and
which
has
been
consigned
to
the
documents
in
the
*NL*
case
:
--
``
What
matters
it
whether
they
come
to
our
assistance
or
not
?
Let
*NL*
us
get
ourselves
killed
here
,
to
the
very
last
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
reader
sees
,
the
two
barricades
,
though
materially
isolated
,
were
*NL*
in
communication
with
each
other
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
IV
--
MINUS
FIVE
,
PLUS
ONE
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
man
who
decreed
the
``
protest
of
corpses
''
had
spoken
,
and
had
*NL*
given
this
formula
of
their
common
soul
,
there
issued
from
all
mouths
a
*NL*
strangely
satisfied
and
terrible
cry
,
funereal
in
sense
and
triumphant
*NL*
in
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
live
death
!
Let
us
all
remain
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
all
?
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
!
All
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
position
is
good
;
the
barricade
is
fine
.
Thirty
men
are
enough
.
Why
*NL*
sacrifice
forty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
not
one
will
go
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizens
,
''
cried
Enjolras
,
and
there
was
an
almost
irritated
vibration
*NL*
in
his
voice
,
``
this
republic
is
not
rich
enough
in
men
to
indulge
in
*NL*
useless
expenditure
of
them
.
Vain-glory
is
waste
.
If
the
duty
of
some
is
*NL*
to
depart
,
that
duty
should
be
fulfilled
like
any
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
the
man-principle
,
had
over
his
co-religionists
that
sort
of
*NL*
omnipotent
power
which
emanates
from
the
absolute
.
Still
,
great
as
was
*NL*
this
omnipotence
,
a
murmur
arose
.
A
leader
to
the
very
finger-tips
,
*NL*
Enjolras
,
seeing
that
they
murmured
,
insisted
.
He
resumed
haughtily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
those
who
are
afraid
of
not
numbering
more
than
thirty
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
murmurs
redoubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
observed
a
voice
in
one
group
,
``
it
is
easy
enough
to
talk
*NL*
about
leaving
.
The
barricade
is
hemmed
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
on
the
side
of
the
Halles
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
``
The
Rue
Mondetour
is
*NL*
free
,
and
through
the
Rue
des
Precheurs
one
can
reach
the
Marche
des
*NL*
Innocents
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
,
''
went
on
another
voice
,
``
you
would
be
captured
.
You
would
*NL*
fall
in
with
some
grand
guard
of
the
line
or
the
suburbs
;
they
will
spy
*NL*
a
man
passing
in
blouse
and
cap
.
`
Whence
come
you
?
'
`
Do
n't
you
belong
to
*NL*
the
barricade
?
'
And
they
will
look
at
your
hands
.
You
smell
of
powder
.
*NL*
Shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
without
making
any
reply
,
touched
Combeferre
's
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
the
two
entered
the
tap-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
emerged
thence
a
moment
later
.
Enjolras
held
in
his
outstretched
*NL*
hands
the
four
uniforms
which
he
had
laid
aside
.
Combeferre
followed
,
*NL*
carrying
the
shoulder-belts
and
the
shakos
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
this
uniform
,
''
said
Enjolras
,
``
you
can
mingle
with
the
ranks
and
*NL*
escape
;
here
is
enough
for
four
.
''
And
he
flung
on
the
ground
,
deprived
*NL*
of
its
pavement
,
the
four
uniforms
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
wavering
took
place
in
his
stoical
audience
.
Combeferre
took
the
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
must
have
a
little
pity
.
Do
you
know
what
the
*NL*
question
is
here
?
It
is
a
question
of
women
.
See
here
.
Are
there
*NL*
women
or
are
there
not
?
Are
there
children
or
are
there
not
?
Are
there
*NL*
mothers
,
yes
or
no
,
who
rock
cradles
with
their
foot
and
who
have
a
lot
*NL*
of
little
ones
around
them
?
Let
that
man
of
you
who
has
never
beheld
a
*NL*
nurse
's
breast
raise
his
hand
.
Ah
!
you
want
to
get
yourselves
killed
,
so
*NL*
do
I
--
I
,
who
am
speaking
to
you
;
but
I
do
not
want
to
feel
the
phantoms
*NL*
of
women
wreathing
their
arms
around
me
.
Die
,
if
you
will
,
but
*NL*
do
n't
make
others
die
.
Suicides
like
that
which
is
on
the
brink
of
*NL*
accomplishment
here
are
sublime
;
but
suicide
is
narrow
,
and
does
not
*NL*
admit
of
extension
;
and
as
soon
as
it
touches
your
neighbors
,
suicide
*NL*
is
murder
.
Think
of
the
little
blond
heads
;
think
of
the
white
locks
.
*NL*
Listen
,
Enjolras
has
just
told
me
that
he
saw
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Cygne
a
lighted
casement
,
a
candle
in
a
poor
window
,
on
the
fifth
*NL*
floor
,
and
on
the
pane
the
quivering
shadow
of
the
head
of
an
old
woman
,
*NL*
who
had
the
air
of
having
spent
the
night
in
watching
.
Perhaps
she
is
*NL*
the
mother
of
some
one
of
you
.
Well
,
let
that
man
go
,
and
make
haste
,
to
*NL*
say
to
his
mother
:
`
Here
I
am
,
mother
!
'
Let
him
feel
at
ease
,
the
task
*NL*
here
will
be
performed
all
the
same
.
When
one
supports
one
's
relatives
*NL*
by
one
's
toil
,
one
has
not
the
right
to
sacrifice
one
's
self
.
That
*NL*
is
deserting
one
's
family
.
And
those
who
have
daughters
!
what
are
you
*NL*
thinking
of
?
You
get
yourselves
killed
,
you
are
dead
,
that
is
well
.
And
*NL*
tomorrow
?
Young
girls
without
bread
--
that
is
a
terrible
thing
.
Man
begs
,
*NL*
woman
sells
.
Ah
!
those
charming
and
gracious
beings
,
so
gracious
and
so
*NL*
sweet
,
who
have
bonnets
of
flowers
,
who
fill
the
house
with
purity
,
who
*NL*
sing
and
prattle
,
who
are
like
a
living
perfume
,
who
prove
the
existence
*NL*
of
angels
in
heaven
by
the
purity
of
virgins
on
earth
,
that
Jeanne
,
*NL*
that
Lise
,
that
Mimi
,
those
adorable
and
honest
creatures
who
are
your
*NL*
blessings
and
your
pride
,
ah
!
good
God
,
they
will
suffer
hunger
!
What
do
*NL*
you
want
me
to
say
to
you
?
There
is
a
market
for
human
flesh
;
and
it
*NL*
is
not
with
your
shadowy
hands
,
shuddering
around
them
,
that
you
*NL*
will
prevent
them
from
entering
it
!
Think
of
the
street
,
think
of
the
*NL*
pavement
covered
with
passers-by
,
think
of
the
shops
past
which
women
*NL*
go
and
come
with
necks
all
bare
,
and
through
the
mire
.
These
women
,
*NL*
too
,
were
pure
once
.
Think
of
your
sisters
,
those
of
you
who
have
them
.
*NL*
Misery
,
prostitution
,
the
police
,
Saint-Lazare
--
that
is
what
those
*NL*
beautiful
,
delicate
girls
,
those
fragile
marvels
of
modesty
,
gentleness
*NL*
and
loveliness
,
fresher
than
lilacs
in
the
month
of
May
,
will
come
to
.
*NL*
Ah
!
you
have
got
yourselves
killed
!
You
are
no
longer
on
hand
!
That
*NL*
is
well
;
you
have
wished
to
release
the
people
from
Royalty
,
and
you
*NL*
deliver
over
your
daughters
to
the
police
.
Friends
,
have
a
care
,
have
*NL*
mercy
.
Women
,
unhappy
women
,
we
are
not
in
the
habit
of
bestowing
much
*NL*
thought
on
them
.
We
trust
to
the
women
not
having
received
a
man
's
*NL*
education
,
we
prevent
their
reading
,
we
prevent
their
thinking
,
we
*NL*
prevent
their
occupying
themselves
with
politics
;
will
you
prevent
them
*NL*
from
going
to
the
dead-house
this
evening
,
and
recognizing
your
bodies
?
*NL*
Let
us
see
,
those
who
have
families
must
be
tractable
,
and
shake
hands
*NL*
with
us
and
take
themselves
off
,
and
leave
us
here
alone
to
attend
to
*NL*
this
affair
.
I
know
well
that
courage
is
required
to
leave
,
that
it
is
*NL*
hard
;
but
the
harder
it
is
,
the
more
meritorious
.
You
say
:
'
I
have
a
*NL*
gun
,
I
am
at
the
barricade
;
so
much
the
worse
,
I
shall
remain
there
.
'
So
*NL*
much
the
worse
is
easily
said
.
My
friends
,
there
is
a
morrow
;
you
will
*NL*
not
be
here
to-morrow
,
but
your
families
will
;
and
what
sufferings
!
See
,
*NL*
here
is
a
pretty
,
healthy
child
,
with
cheeks
like
an
apple
,
who
babbles
,
*NL*
prattles
,
chatters
,
who
laughs
,
who
smells
sweet
beneath
your
kiss
,
--
and
*NL*
do
you
know
what
becomes
of
him
when
he
is
abandoned
?
I
have
seen
one
,
*NL*
a
very
small
creature
,
no
taller
than
that
.
His
father
was
dead
.
Poor
*NL*
people
had
taken
him
in
out
of
charity
,
but
they
had
bread
only
for
*NL*
themselves
.
The
child
was
always
hungry
.
It
was
winter
.
He
did
not
cry
.
*NL*
You
could
see
him
approach
the
stove
,
in
which
there
was
never
any
fire
,
*NL*
and
whose
pipe
,
you
know
,
was
of
mastic
and
yellow
clay
.
His
breathing
*NL*
was
hoarse
,
his
face
livid
,
his
limbs
flaccid
,
his
belly
prominent
.
He
*NL*
said
nothing
.
If
you
spoke
to
him
,
he
did
not
answer
.
He
is
dead
.
He
was
*NL*
taken
to
the
Necker
Hospital
,
where
I
saw
him
.
I
was
house-surgeon
in
*NL*
that
hospital
.
Now
,
if
there
are
any
fathers
among
you
,
fathers
whose
*NL*
happiness
it
is
to
stroll
on
Sundays
holding
their
child
's
tiny
hand
in
*NL*
their
robust
hand
,
let
each
one
of
those
fathers
imagine
that
this
child
*NL*
is
his
own
.
That
poor
brat
,
I
remember
,
and
I
seem
to
see
him
now
,
when
*NL*
he
lay
nude
on
the
dissecting
table
,
how
his
ribs
stood
out
on
his
skin
*NL*
like
the
graves
beneath
the
grass
in
a
cemetery
.
A
sort
of
mud
was
found
*NL*
in
his
stomach
.
There
were
ashes
in
his
teeth
.
Come
,
let
us
examine
*NL*
ourselves
conscientiously
and
take
counsel
with
our
heart
.
Statistics
*NL*
show
that
the
mortality
among
abandoned
children
is
fifty-five
per
cent
.
*NL*
I
repeat
,
it
is
a
question
of
women
,
it
concerns
mothers
,
it
concerns
*NL*
young
girls
,
it
concerns
little
children
.
Who
is
talking
to
you
of
*NL*
yourselves
?
We
know
well
what
you
are
;
we
know
well
that
you
are
all
*NL*
brave
,
parbleu
!
we
know
well
that
you
all
have
in
your
souls
the
joy
and
*NL*
the
glory
of
giving
your
life
for
the
great
cause
;
we
know
well
that
you
*NL*
feel
yourselves
elected
to
die
usefully
and
magnificently
,
and
that
each
*NL*
one
of
you
clings
to
his
share
in
the
triumph
.
Very
well
.
But
you
are
*NL*
not
alone
in
this
world
.
There
are
other
beings
of
whom
you
must
think
.
*NL*
You
must
not
be
egoists
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
dropped
their
heads
with
a
gloomy
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
contradictions
of
the
human
heart
at
its
most
sublime
moments
.
*NL*
Combeferre
,
who
spoke
thus
,
was
not
an
orphan
.
He
recalled
the
mothers
*NL*
of
other
men
,
and
forgot
his
own
.
He
was
about
to
get
himself
killed
.
He
*NL*
was
``
an
egoist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
fasting
,
fevered
,
having
emerged
in
succession
from
all
hope
,
*NL*
and
having
been
stranded
in
grief
,
the
most
sombre
of
shipwrecks
,
and
*NL*
saturated
with
violent
emotions
and
conscious
that
the
end
was
near
,
*NL*
had
plunged
deeper
and
deeper
into
that
visionary
stupor
which
always
*NL*
precedes
the
fatal
hour
voluntarily
accepted
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
physiologist
might
have
studied
in
him
the
growing
symptoms
of
that
*NL*
febrile
absorption
known
to
,
and
classified
by
,
science
,
and
which
is
*NL*
to
suffering
what
voluptuousness
is
to
pleasure
.
Despair
,
also
,
has
its
*NL*
ecstasy
.
Marius
had
reached
this
point
.
He
looked
on
at
everything
as
*NL*
from
without
;
as
we
have
said
,
things
which
passed
before
him
seemed
far
*NL*
away
;
he
made
out
the
whole
,
but
did
not
perceive
the
details
.
He
beheld
*NL*
men
going
and
coming
as
through
a
flame
.
He
heard
voices
speaking
as
at
*NL*
the
bottom
of
an
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
moved
him
.
There
was
in
this
scene
a
point
which
pierced
and
*NL*
roused
even
him
.
He
had
but
one
idea
now
,
to
die
;
and
he
did
not
wish
to
*NL*
be
turned
aside
from
it
,
but
he
reflected
,
in
his
gloomy
somnambulism
,
*NL*
that
while
destroying
himself
,
he
was
not
prohibited
from
saving
some
*NL*
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
raised
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enjolras
and
Combeferre
are
right
,
''
said
he
;
``
no
unnecessary
sacrifice
.
*NL*
I
join
them
,
and
you
must
make
haste
.
Combeferre
has
said
convincing
*NL*
things
to
you
.
There
are
some
among
you
who
have
families
,
mothers
,
*NL*
sisters
,
wives
,
children
.
Let
such
leave
the
ranks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Married
men
and
the
supporters
of
families
,
step
out
of
the
ranks
!
''
*NL*
repeated
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
authority
was
great
.
Enjolras
was
certainly
the
head
of
the
*NL*
barricade
,
but
Marius
was
its
savior
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
order
it
,
''
cried
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
entreat
you
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
touched
by
Combeferre
's
words
,
shaken
by
Enjolras
'
order
,
touched
*NL*
by
Marius
'
entreaty
,
these
heroic
men
began
to
denounce
each
other
.
--
``
It
*NL*
is
true
,
''
said
one
young
man
to
a
full
grown
man
,
``
you
are
the
father
*NL*
of
a
family
.
Go
.
''
--
``
It
is
your
duty
rather
,
''
retorted
the
man
,
``
you
have
*NL*
two
sisters
whom
you
maintain
.
''
--
And
an
unprecedented
controversy
broke
*NL*
forth
.
Each
struggled
to
determine
which
should
not
allow
himself
to
be
*NL*
placed
at
the
door
of
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Make
haste
,
''
said
Courfeyrac
,
``
in
another
quarter
of
an
hour
it
will
be
*NL*
too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizens
,
''
pursued
Enjolras
,
``
this
is
the
Republic
,
and
universal
*NL*
suffrage
reigns
.
Do
you
yourselves
designate
those
who
are
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
obeyed
.
After
the
expiration
of
a
few
minutes
,
five
were
*NL*
unanimously
selected
and
stepped
out
of
the
ranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
five
of
them
!
''
exclaimed
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
four
uniforms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
began
the
five
,
``
one
must
stay
behind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
a
struggle
arose
as
to
who
should
remain
,
and
who
should
find
*NL*
reasons
for
the
others
not
remaining
.
The
generous
quarrel
began
afresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
wife
who
loves
you
.
''
--
``
You
have
your
aged
mother
.
''
--
''
You
*NL*
have
neither
father
nor
mother
,
and
what
is
to
become
of
your
three
*NL*
little
brothers
?
''
--
``
You
are
the
father
of
five
children
.
''
--
``
You
have
a
*NL*
right
to
live
,
you
are
only
seventeen
,
it
is
too
early
for
you
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
great
revolutionary
barricades
were
assembling
points
for
heroism
.
*NL*
The
improbable
was
simple
there
.
These
men
did
not
astonish
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quick
,
''
repeated
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Men
shouted
to
Marius
from
the
groups
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
designate
who
is
to
remain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
five
,
``
choose
.
We
will
obey
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
did
not
believe
that
he
was
capable
of
another
emotion
.
Still
,
*NL*
at
this
idea
,
that
of
choosing
a
man
for
death
,
his
blood
rushed
back
*NL*
to
his
heart
.
He
would
have
turned
pale
,
had
it
been
possible
for
him
to
*NL*
become
any
paler
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
towards
the
five
,
who
smiled
upon
him
,
and
each
,
with
his
*NL*
eyes
full
of
that
grand
flame
which
one
beholds
in
the
depths
of
history
*NL*
hovering
over
Thermopylae
,
cried
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
me
!
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Marius
stupidly
counted
them
;
there
were
still
five
of
them
!
Then
*NL*
his
glance
dropped
to
the
four
uniforms
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
fifth
uniform
fell
,
as
if
from
heaven
,
upon
the
other
*NL*
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifth
man
was
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
raised
his
eyes
and
recognized
M.
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
just
entered
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
arrived
by
way
of
Mondetour
lane
,
whither
by
dint
of
inquiries
*NL*
made
,
or
by
instinct
,
or
chance
.
Thanks
to
his
dress
of
a
National
*NL*
Guardsman
,
he
had
made
his
way
without
difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sentinel
stationed
by
the
insurgents
in
the
Rue
Mondetour
had
no
*NL*
occasion
to
give
the
alarm
for
a
single
National
Guardsman
,
and
he
had
*NL*
allowed
the
latter
to
entangle
himself
in
the
street
,
saying
to
himself
:
*NL*
``
Probably
it
is
a
reinforcement
,
in
any
case
it
is
a
prisoner
.
''
The
*NL*
moment
was
too
grave
to
admit
of
the
sentinel
abandoning
his
duty
and
*NL*
his
post
of
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Jean
Valjean
entered
the
redoubt
,
no
one
had
noticed
*NL*
him
,
all
eyes
being
fixed
on
the
five
chosen
men
and
the
four
uniforms
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
also
had
seen
and
heard
,
and
he
had
silently
removed
his
*NL*
coat
and
flung
it
on
the
pile
with
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
emotion
aroused
was
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
this
man
?
''
demanded
Bossuet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
who
saves
others
,
''
replied
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
added
in
a
grave
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
guarantee
satisfied
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
turned
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
,
citizen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
that
we
are
about
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
without
replying
,
helped
the
insurgent
whom
he
was
saving
*NL*
to
don
his
uniform
.

CHAPTER
V
--
THE
HORIZON
WHICH
ONE
BEHOLDS
FROM
THE
SUMMIT
OF
A
BARRICADE
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
all
in
that
fatal
hour
and
that
pitiless
place
,
had
as
*NL*
result
and
culminating
point
Enjolras
'
supreme
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
bore
within
him
the
plenitude
of
the
revolution
;
he
was
*NL*
incomplete
,
however
,
so
far
as
the
absolute
can
be
so
;
he
had
too
much
*NL*
of
Saint-Just
about
him
,
and
not
enough
of
Anacharsis
Cloots
;
still
,
*NL*
his
mind
,
in
the
society
of
the
Friends
of
the
A
B
C
,
had
ended
by
*NL*
undergoing
a
certain
polarization
from
Combeferre
's
ideas
;
for
some
time
*NL*
past
,
he
had
been
gradually
emerging
from
the
narrow
form
of
dogma
,
and
*NL*
had
allowed
himself
to
incline
to
the
broadening
influence
of
progress
,
*NL*
and
he
had
come
to
accept
,
as
a
definitive
and
magnificent
evolution
,
*NL*
the
transformation
of
the
great
French
Republic
,
into
the
immense
*NL*
human
republic
.
As
far
as
the
immediate
means
were
concerned
,
a
violent
*NL*
situation
being
given
,
he
wished
to
be
violent
;
on
that
point
,
he
never
*NL*
varied
;
and
he
remained
of
that
epic
and
redoubtable
school
which
is
*NL*
summed
up
in
the
words
:
``
Eighty-three
.
''
Enjolras
was
standing
erect
on
*NL*
the
staircase
of
paving-stones
,
one
elbow
resting
on
the
stock
of
*NL*
his
gun
.
He
was
engaged
in
thought
;
he
quivered
,
as
at
the
passage
of
*NL*
prophetic
breaths
;
places
where
death
is
have
these
effects
of
tripods
.
*NL*
A
sort
of
stifled
fire
darted
from
his
eyes
,
which
were
filled
with
an
*NL*
inward
look
.
All
at
once
he
threw
back
his
head
,
his
blond
locks
fell
*NL*
back
like
those
of
an
angel
on
the
sombre
quadriga
made
of
stars
,
they
*NL*
were
like
the
mane
of
a
startled
lion
in
the
flaming
of
an
halo
,
and
*NL*
Enjolras
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizens
,
do
you
picture
the
future
to
yourselves
?
The
streets
of
*NL*
cities
inundated
with
light
,
green
branches
on
the
thresholds
,
nations
*NL*
sisters
,
men
just
,
old
men
blessing
children
,
the
past
loving
the
*NL*
present
,
thinkers
entirely
at
liberty
,
believers
on
terms
of
full
*NL*
equality
,
for
religion
heaven
,
God
the
direct
priest
,
human
conscience
*NL*
become
an
altar
,
no
more
hatreds
,
the
fraternity
of
the
workshop
and
the
*NL*
school
,
for
sole
penalty
and
recompense
fame
,
work
for
all
,
right
for
*NL*
all
,
peace
over
all
,
no
more
bloodshed
,
no
more
wars
,
happy
mothers
!
To
*NL*
conquer
matter
is
the
first
step
;
to
realize
the
ideal
is
the
second
.
*NL*
Reflect
on
what
progress
has
already
accomplished
.
Formerly
,
the
*NL*
first
human
races
beheld
with
terror
the
hydra
pass
before
their
eyes
,
*NL*
breathing
on
the
waters
,
the
dragon
which
vomited
flame
,
the
griffin
who
*NL*
was
the
monster
of
the
air
,
and
who
flew
with
the
wings
of
an
eagle
*NL*
and
the
talons
of
a
tiger
;
fearful
beasts
which
were
above
man
.
Man
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
spread
his
snares
,
consecrated
by
intelligence
,
and
*NL*
finally
conquered
these
monsters
.
We
have
vanquished
the
hydra
,
and
*NL*
it
is
called
the
locomotive
;
we
are
on
the
point
of
vanquishing
the
*NL*
griffin
,
we
already
grasp
it
,
and
it
is
called
the
balloon
.
On
the
day
*NL*
when
this
Promethean
task
shall
be
accomplished
,
and
when
man
shall
have
*NL*
definitely
harnessed
to
his
will
the
triple
Chimaera
of
antiquity
,
the
*NL*
hydra
,
the
dragon
and
the
griffin
,
he
will
be
the
master
of
water
,
fire
,
*NL*
and
of
air
,
and
he
will
be
for
the
rest
of
animated
creation
that
which
*NL*
the
ancient
gods
formerly
were
to
him
.
Courage
,
and
onward
!
Citizens
,
*NL*
whither
are
we
going
?
To
science
made
government
,
to
the
force
of
things
*NL*
become
the
sole
public
force
,
to
the
natural
law
,
having
in
itself
its
*NL*
sanction
and
its
penalty
and
promulgating
itself
by
evidence
,
to
a
dawn
*NL*
of
truth
corresponding
to
a
dawn
of
day
.
We
are
advancing
to
the
union
*NL*
of
peoples
;
we
are
advancing
to
the
unity
of
man
.
No
more
fictions
;
*NL*
no
more
parasites
.
The
real
governed
by
the
true
,
that
is
the
goal
.
*NL*
Civilization
will
hold
its
assizes
at
the
summit
of
Europe
,
and
,
*NL*
later
on
,
at
the
centre
of
continents
,
in
a
grand
parliament
of
the
*NL*
intelligence
.
Something
similar
has
already
been
seen
.
The
amphictyons
*NL*
had
two
sittings
a
year
,
one
at
Delphos
the
seat
of
the
gods
,
the
other
*NL*
at
Thermopylae
,
the
place
of
heroes
.
Europe
will
have
her
amphictyons
;
*NL*
the
globe
will
have
its
amphictyons
.
France
bears
this
sublime
future
in
*NL*
her
breast
.
This
is
the
gestation
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
That
which
*NL*
Greece
sketched
out
is
worthy
of
being
finished
by
France
.
Listen
to
me
,
*NL*
you
,
Feuilly
,
valiant
artisan
,
man
of
the
people
.
I
revere
you
.
Yes
,
you
*NL*
clearly
behold
the
future
,
yes
,
you
are
right
.
You
had
neither
father
*NL*
nor
mother
,
Feuilly
;
you
adopted
humanity
for
your
mother
and
right
*NL*
for
your
father
.
You
are
about
to
die
,
that
is
to
say
to
triumph
,
here
.
*NL*
Citizens
,
whatever
happens
to-day
,
through
our
defeat
as
well
as
*NL*
through
our
victory
,
it
is
a
revolution
that
we
are
about
to
create
.
*NL*
As
conflagrations
light
up
a
whole
city
,
so
revolutions
illuminate
the
*NL*
whole
human
race
.
And
what
is
the
revolution
that
we
shall
cause
?
I
have
*NL*
just
told
you
,
the
Revolution
of
the
True
.
From
a
political
point
of
*NL*
view
,
there
is
but
a
single
principle
;
the
sovereignty
of
man
over
*NL*
himself
.
This
sovereignty
of
myself
over
myself
is
called
Liberty
.
Where
*NL*
two
or
three
of
these
sovereignties
are
combined
,
the
state
begins
.
But
*NL*
in
that
association
there
is
no
abdication
.
Each
sovereignty
concedes
a
*NL*
certain
quantity
of
itself
,
for
the
purpose
of
forming
the
common
right
.
*NL*
This
quantity
is
the
same
for
all
of
us
.
This
identity
of
concession
*NL*
which
each
makes
to
all
,
is
called
Equality
.
Common
right
is
nothing
*NL*
else
than
the
protection
of
all
beaming
on
the
right
of
each
.
This
*NL*
protection
of
all
over
each
is
called
Fraternity
.
The
point
of
*NL*
intersection
of
all
these
assembled
sovereignties
is
called
society
.
*NL*
This
intersection
being
a
junction
,
this
point
is
a
knot
.
Hence
what
*NL*
is
called
the
social
bond
.
Some
say
social
contract
;
which
is
the
same
*NL*
thing
,
the
word
contract
being
etymologically
formed
with
the
idea
of
a
*NL*
bond
.
Let
us
come
to
an
understanding
about
equality
;
for
,
if
liberty
*NL*
is
the
summit
,
equality
is
the
base
.
Equality
,
citizens
,
is
not
wholly
a
*NL*
surface
vegetation
,
a
society
of
great
blades
of
grass
and
tiny
oaks
;
a
*NL*
proximity
of
jealousies
which
render
each
other
null
and
void
;
legally
*NL*
speaking
,
it
is
all
aptitudes
possessed
of
the
same
opportunity
;
*NL*
politically
,
it
is
all
votes
possessed
of
the
same
weight
;
religiously
,
*NL*
it
is
all
consciences
possessed
of
the
same
right
.
Equality
has
an
*NL*
organ
:
gratuitous
and
obligatory
instruction
.
The
right
to
the
alphabet
,
*NL*
that
is
where
the
beginning
must
be
made
.
The
primary
school
imposed
*NL*
on
all
,
the
secondary
school
offered
to
all
,
that
is
the
law
.
From
an
*NL*
identical
school
,
an
identical
society
will
spring
.
Yes
,
instruction
!
*NL*
light
!
light
!
everything
comes
from
light
,
and
to
it
everything
returns
.
*NL*
Citizens
,
the
nineteenth
century
is
great
,
but
the
twentieth
century
*NL*
will
be
happy
.
Then
,
there
will
be
nothing
more
like
the
history
of
old
,
*NL*
we
shall
no
longer
,
as
to-day
,
have
to
fear
a
conquest
,
an
invasion
,
*NL*
a
usurpation
,
a
rivalry
of
nations
,
arms
in
hand
,
an
interruption
of
*NL*
civilization
depending
on
a
marriage
of
kings
,
on
a
birth
in
hereditary
*NL*
tyrannies
,
a
partition
of
peoples
by
a
congress
,
a
dismemberment
because
*NL*
of
the
failure
of
a
dynasty
,
a
combat
of
two
religions
meeting
face
*NL*
to
face
,
like
two
bucks
in
the
dark
,
on
the
bridge
of
the
infinite
;
we
*NL*
shall
no
longer
have
to
fear
famine
,
farming
out
,
prostitution
arising
*NL*
from
distress
,
misery
from
the
failure
of
work
and
the
scaffold
and
the
*NL*
sword
,
and
battles
and
the
ruffianism
of
chance
in
the
forest
of
events
.
*NL*
One
might
almost
say
:
There
will
be
no
more
events
.
We
shall
be
happy
.
*NL*
The
human
race
will
accomplish
its
law
,
as
the
terrestrial
globe
*NL*
accomplishes
its
law
;
harmony
will
be
re-established
between
the
soul
*NL*
and
the
star
;
the
soul
will
gravitate
around
the
truth
,
as
the
planet
*NL*
around
the
light
.
Friends
,
the
present
hour
in
which
I
am
addressing
*NL*
you
,
is
a
gloomy
hour
;
but
these
are
terrible
purchases
of
the
future
.
*NL*
A
revolution
is
a
toll
.
Oh
!
the
human
race
will
be
delivered
,
raised
up
,
*NL*
consoled
!
We
affirm
it
on
this
barrier
.
Whence
should
proceed
that
cry
*NL*
of
love
,
if
not
from
the
heights
of
sacrifice
?
Oh
my
brothers
,
this
is
*NL*
the
point
of
junction
,
of
those
who
think
and
of
those
who
suffer
;
this
*NL*
barricade
is
not
made
of
paving-stones
,
nor
of
joists
,
nor
of
bits
of
*NL*
iron
;
it
is
made
of
two
heaps
,
a
heap
of
ideas
,
and
a
heap
of
woes
.
Here
*NL*
misery
meets
the
ideal
.
The
day
embraces
the
night
,
and
says
to
it
:
'
I
*NL*
am
about
to
die
,
and
thou
shalt
be
born
again
with
me
.
'
From
the
embrace
*NL*
of
all
desolations
faith
leaps
forth
.
Sufferings
bring
hither
their
*NL*
agony
and
ideas
their
immortality
.
This
agony
and
this
immortality
are
*NL*
about
to
join
and
constitute
our
death
.
Brothers
,
he
who
dies
here
dies
*NL*
in
the
radiance
of
the
future
,
and
we
are
entering
a
tomb
all
flooded
*NL*
with
the
dawn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
paused
rather
than
became
silent
;
his
lips
continued
to
move
*NL*
silently
,
as
though
he
were
talking
to
himself
,
which
caused
them
all
*NL*
to
gaze
attentively
at
him
,
in
the
endeavor
to
hear
more
.
There
was
no
*NL*
applause
;
but
they
whispered
together
for
a
long
time
.
Speech
being
a
*NL*
breath
,
the
rustling
of
intelligences
resembles
the
rustling
of
leaves
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
MARIUS
HAGGARD
,
JAVERT
LACONIC
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
narrate
what
was
passing
in
Marius
'
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
recall
the
state
of
his
soul
.
We
have
just
recalled
it
,
*NL*
everything
was
a
vision
to
him
now
.
His
judgment
was
disturbed
.
Marius
,
*NL*
let
us
insist
on
this
point
,
was
under
the
shadow
of
the
great
,
dark
*NL*
wings
which
are
spread
over
those
in
the
death
agony
.
He
felt
that
he
*NL*
had
entered
the
tomb
,
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
already
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
wall
,
and
he
no
longer
beheld
the
faces
of
the
living
except
*NL*
with
the
eyes
of
one
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
M.
Fauchelevent
come
there
?
Why
was
he
there
?
What
had
he
come
*NL*
there
to
do
?
Marius
did
not
address
all
these
questions
to
himself
.
*NL*
Besides
,
since
our
despair
has
this
peculiarity
,
that
it
envelops
others
*NL*
as
well
as
ourselves
,
it
seemed
logical
to
him
that
all
the
world
should
*NL*
come
thither
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
he
thought
of
Cosette
with
a
pang
at
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
M.
Fauchelevent
did
not
speak
to
him
,
did
not
look
at
him
,
and
*NL*
had
not
even
the
air
of
hearing
him
,
when
Marius
raised
his
voice
to
*NL*
say
:
``
I
know
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
far
as
Marius
was
concerned
,
this
attitude
of
M.
Fauchelevent
was
*NL*
comforting
,
and
,
if
such
a
word
can
be
used
for
such
impressions
,
*NL*
we
should
say
that
it
pleased
him
.
He
had
always
felt
the
absolute
*NL*
impossibility
of
addressing
that
enigmatical
man
,
who
was
,
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
both
equivocal
and
imposing
.
Moreover
,
it
had
been
a
long
time
since
*NL*
he
had
seen
him
;
and
this
still
further
augmented
the
impossibility
for
*NL*
Marius
'
timid
and
reserved
nature
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
five
chosen
men
left
the
barricade
by
way
of
Mondetour
lane
;
they
*NL*
bore
a
perfect
resemblance
to
members
of
the
National
Guard
.
One
of
them
*NL*
wept
as
he
took
his
leave
.
Before
setting
out
,
they
embraced
those
who
*NL*
remained
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
five
men
sent
back
to
life
had
taken
their
departure
,
Enjolras
*NL*
thought
of
the
man
who
had
been
condemned
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
the
tap-room
.
Javert
,
still
bound
to
the
post
,
was
engaged
in
*NL*
meditation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
anything
?
''
Enjolras
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
replied
:
``
When
are
you
going
to
kill
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
.
We
need
all
our
cartridges
just
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
give
me
a
drink
,
''
said
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
himself
offered
him
a
glass
of
water
,
and
,
as
Javert
was
*NL*
pinioned
,
he
helped
him
to
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
inquired
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
uncomfortable
against
this
post
,
''
replied
Javert
.
``
You
are
not
*NL*
tender
to
have
left
me
to
pass
the
night
here
.
Bind
me
as
you
please
,
*NL*
but
you
surely
might
lay
me
out
on
a
table
like
that
other
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
motion
of
the
head
,
he
indicated
the
body
of
M.
Mabeuf
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
a
long
,
broad
table
at
the
*NL*
end
of
the
room
,
on
which
they
had
been
running
bullets
and
making
*NL*
cartridges
.
All
the
cartridges
having
been
made
,
and
all
the
powder
*NL*
used
,
this
table
was
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Enjolras
'
command
,
four
insurgents
unbound
Javert
from
the
post
.
*NL*
While
they
were
loosing
him
,
a
fifth
held
a
bayonet
against
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
his
arms
tied
behind
his
back
,
they
placed
about
his
feet
a
*NL*
slender
but
stout
whip-cord
,
as
is
done
to
men
on
the
point
of
mounting
*NL*
the
scaffold
,
which
allowed
him
to
take
steps
about
fifteen
inches
in
*NL*
length
,
and
made
him
walk
to
the
table
at
the
end
of
the
room
,
where
*NL*
they
laid
him
down
,
closely
bound
about
the
middle
of
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
further
security
,
and
by
means
of
a
rope
fastened
to
his
neck
,
*NL*
they
added
to
the
system
of
ligatures
which
rendered
every
attempt
*NL*
at
escape
impossible
,
that
sort
of
bond
which
is
called
in
prisons
a
*NL*
martingale
,
which
,
starting
at
the
neck
,
forks
on
the
stomach
,
and
meets
*NL*
the
hands
,
after
passing
between
the
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
binding
Javert
,
a
man
standing
on
the
threshold
was
*NL*
surveying
him
with
singular
attention
.
The
shadow
cast
by
this
man
made
*NL*
Javert
turn
his
head
.
He
raised
his
eyes
,
and
recognized
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
He
did
not
even
start
,
but
dropped
his
lids
proudly
and
confined
himself
*NL*
to
the
remark
:
``
It
is
perfectly
simple
.
''
*NL*
*NL*

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
SITUATION
BECOMES
AGGRAVATED
*NL*
*NL*
The
daylight
was
increasing
rapidly
.
Not
a
window
was
opened
,
not
a
door
*NL*
stood
ajar
;
it
was
the
dawn
but
not
the
awaking
.
The
end
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
la
Chanvrerie
,
opposite
the
barricade
,
had
been
evacuated
by
the
*NL*
troops
,
as
we
have
stated
it
seemed
to
be
free
,
and
presented
itself
to
*NL*
passers-by
with
a
sinister
tranquillity
.
The
Rue
Saint-Denis
was
as
*NL*
dumb
as
the
avenue
of
Sphinxes
at
Thebes
.
Not
a
living
being
in
the
*NL*
cross-roads
,
which
gleamed
white
in
the
light
of
the
sun
.
Nothing
is
so
*NL*
mournful
as
this
light
in
deserted
streets
.
Nothing
was
to
be
seen
,
but
*NL*
there
was
something
to
be
heard
.
A
mysterious
movement
was
going
on
at
*NL*
a
certain
distance
.
It
was
evident
that
the
critical
moment
was
*NL*
approaching
.
As
on
the
previous
evening
,
the
sentinels
had
come
in
;
but
*NL*
this
time
all
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barricade
was
stronger
than
on
the
occasion
of
the
first
attack
.
*NL*
Since
the
departure
of
the
five
,
they
had
increased
its
height
still
*NL*
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
advice
of
the
sentinel
who
had
examined
the
region
of
the
*NL*
Halles
,
Enjolras
,
for
fear
of
a
surprise
in
the
rear
,
came
to
a
serious
*NL*
decision
.
He
had
the
small
gut
of
the
Mondetour
lane
,
which
had
been
*NL*
left
open
up
to
that
time
,
barricaded
.
For
this
purpose
,
they
tore
up
*NL*
the
pavement
for
the
length
of
several
houses
more
.
In
this
manner
,
*NL*
the
barricade
,
walled
on
three
streets
,
in
front
on
the
Rue
de
*NL*
la
Chanvrerie
,
to
the
left
on
the
Rues
du
Cygne
and
de
la
Petite
*NL*
Truanderie
,
to
the
right
on
the
Rue
Mondetour
,
was
really
almost
*NL*
impregnable
;
it
is
true
that
they
were
fatally
hemmed
in
there
.
It
*NL*
had
three
fronts
,
but
no
exit
.
--
``
A
fortress
but
a
rat
hole
too
,
''
said
*NL*
Courfeyrac
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
had
about
thirty
paving-stones
``
torn
up
in
excess
,
''
said
*NL*
Bossuet
,
piled
up
near
the
door
of
the
wine-shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
was
now
so
profound
in
the
quarter
whence
the
attack
must
*NL*
needs
come
,
that
Enjolras
had
each
man
resume
his
post
of
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
allowance
of
brandy
was
doled
out
to
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
more
curious
than
a
barricade
preparing
for
an
assault
.
Each
*NL*
man
selects
his
place
as
though
at
the
theatre
.
They
jostle
,
and
elbow
*NL*
and
crowd
each
other
.
There
are
some
who
make
stalls
of
paving-stones
.
*NL*
Here
is
a
corner
of
the
wall
which
is
in
the
way
,
it
is
removed
;
here
*NL*
is
a
redan
which
may
afford
protection
,
they
take
shelter
behind
it
.
*NL*
Left-handed
men
are
precious
;
they
take
the
places
that
are
inconvenient
*NL*
to
the
rest
.
Many
arrange
to
fight
in
a
sitting
posture
.
They
wish
to
be
*NL*
at
ease
to
kill
,
and
to
die
comfortably
.
In
the
sad
war
of
June
,
1848
,
*NL*
an
insurgent
who
was
a
formidable
marksman
,
and
who
was
firing
from
the
*NL*
top
of
a
terrace
upon
a
roof
,
had
a
reclining-chair
brought
there
for
*NL*
his
use
;
a
charge
of
grape-shot
found
him
out
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
leader
has
given
the
order
to
clear
the
decks
for
action
,
*NL*
all
disorderly
movements
cease
;
there
is
no
more
pulling
from
one
*NL*
another
;
there
are
no
more
coteries
;
no
more
asides
,
there
is
no
more
*NL*
holding
aloof
;
everything
in
their
spirits
converges
in
,
and
changes
*NL*
into
,
a
waiting
for
the
assailants
.
A
barricade
before
the
arrival
of
*NL*
danger
is
chaos
;
in
danger
,
it
is
discipline
itself
.
Peril
produces
*NL*
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Enjolras
had
seized
his
double-barrelled
rifle
,
and
had
*NL*
placed
himself
in
a
sort
of
embrasure
which
he
had
reserved
for
himself
,
*NL*
all
the
rest
held
their
peace
.
A
series
of
faint
,
sharp
noises
resounded
*NL*
confusedly
along
the
wall
of
paving-stones
.
It
was
the
men
cocking
their
*NL*
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
their
attitudes
were
prouder
,
more
confident
than
ever
;
the
*NL*
excess
of
sacrifice
strengthens
;
they
no
longer
cherished
any
hope
,
*NL*
but
they
had
despair
,
despair
,
--
the
last
weapon
,
which
sometimes
gives
*NL*
victory
;
Virgil
has
said
so
.
Supreme
resources
spring
from
extreme
*NL*
resolutions
.
To
embark
in
death
is
sometimes
the
means
of
escaping
a
*NL*
shipwreck
;
and
the
lid
of
the
coffin
becomes
a
plank
of
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
on
the
preceding
evening
,
the
attention
of
all
was
directed
,
we
*NL*
might
almost
say
leaned
upon
,
the
end
of
the
street
,
now
lighted
up
and
*NL*
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
not
long
to
wait
.
A
stir
began
distinctly
in
the
Saint-Leu
*NL*
quarter
,
but
it
did
not
resemble
the
movement
of
the
first
attack
.
A
*NL*
clashing
of
chains
,
the
uneasy
jolting
of
a
mass
,
the
click
of
brass
*NL*
skipping
along
the
pavement
,
a
sort
of
solemn
uproar
,
announced
that
*NL*
some
sinister
construction
of
iron
was
approaching
.
There
arose
a
tremor
*NL*
in
the
bosoms
of
these
peaceful
old
streets
,
pierced
and
built
for
the
*NL*
fertile
circulation
of
interests
and
ideas
,
and
which
are
not
made
for
*NL*
the
horrible
rumble
of
the
wheels
of
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fixity
of
eye
in
all
the
combatants
upon
the
extremity
of
the
street
*NL*
became
ferocious
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
cannon
made
its
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Artillery-men
were
pushing
the
piece
;
it
was
in
firing
trim
;
the
*NL*
fore-carriage
had
been
detached
;
two
upheld
the
gun-carriage
,
four
were
*NL*
at
the
wheels
;
others
followed
with
the
caisson
.
They
could
see
the
*NL*
smoke
of
the
burning
lint-stock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fire
!
''
shouted
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
barricade
fired
,
the
report
was
terrible
;
an
avalanche
of
*NL*
smoke
covered
and
effaced
both
cannon
and
men
;
after
a
few
seconds
,
the
*NL*
cloud
dispersed
,
and
the
cannon
and
men
re-appeared
;
the
gun-crew
had
*NL*
just
finished
rolling
it
slowly
,
correctly
,
without
haste
,
into
position
*NL*
facing
the
barricade
.
Not
one
of
them
had
been
struck
.
Then
the
captain
*NL*
of
the
piece
,
bearing
down
upon
the
breech
in
order
to
raise
the
muzzle
,
*NL*
began
to
point
the
cannon
with
the
gravity
of
an
astronomer
levelling
a
*NL*
telescope
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravo
for
the
cannoneers
!
''
cried
Bossuet
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
whole
barricade
clapped
their
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
squarely
planted
in
the
very
middle
of
the
street
,
*NL*
astride
of
the
gutter
,
the
piece
was
ready
for
action
.
A
formidable
pair
*NL*
of
jaws
yawned
on
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
merrily
now
!
''
ejaculated
Courfeyrac
.
``
That
's
the
brutal
part
of
*NL*
it
.
After
the
fillip
on
the
nose
,
the
blow
from
the
fist
.
The
army
is
*NL*
reaching
out
its
big
paw
to
us
.
The
barricade
is
going
to
be
severely
*NL*
shaken
up
.
The
fusillade
tries
,
the
cannon
takes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
piece
of
eight
,
new
model
,
brass
,
''
added
Combeferre
.
``
Those
*NL*
pieces
are
liable
to
burst
as
soon
as
the
proportion
of
ten
parts
of
tin
*NL*
to
one
hundred
of
brass
is
exceeded
.
The
excess
of
tin
renders
them
too
*NL*
tender
.
Then
it
comes
to
pass
that
they
have
caves
and
chambers
when
*NL*
looked
at
from
the
vent
hole
.
In
order
to
obviate
this
danger
,
and
*NL*
to
render
it
possible
to
force
the
charge
,
it
may
become
necessary
*NL*
to
return
to
the
process
of
the
fourteenth
century
,
hooping
,
and
to
*NL*
encircle
the
piece
on
the
outside
with
a
series
of
unwelded
steel
bands
,
*NL*
from
the
breech
to
the
trunnions
.
In
the
meantime
,
they
remedy
this
*NL*
defect
as
best
they
may
;
they
manage
to
discover
where
the
holes
are
*NL*
located
in
the
vent
of
a
cannon
,
by
means
of
a
searcher
.
But
there
is
a
*NL*
better
method
,
with
Gribeauval
's
movable
star
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
sixteenth
century
,
''
remarked
Bossuet
,
``
they
used
to
rifle
*NL*
cannon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Combeferre
,
``
that
augments
the
projectile
force
,
but
*NL*
diminishes
the
accuracy
of
the
firing
.
In
firing
at
short
range
,
*NL*
the
trajectory
is
not
as
rigid
as
could
be
desired
,
the
parabola
is
*NL*
exaggerated
,
the
line
of
the
projectile
is
no
longer
sufficiently
*NL*
rectilinear
to
allow
of
its
striking
intervening
objects
,
which
is
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
a
necessity
of
battle
,
the
importance
of
which
increases
*NL*
with
the
proximity
of
the
enemy
and
the
precipitation
of
the
discharge
.
*NL*
This
defect
of
the
tension
of
the
curve
of
the
projectile
in
the
rifled
*NL*
cannon
of
the
sixteenth
century
arose
from
the
smallness
of
the
charge
;
*NL*
small
charges
for
that
sort
of
engine
are
imposed
by
the
ballistic
*NL*
necessities
,
such
,
for
instance
,
as
the
preservation
of
the
*NL*
gun-carriage
.
In
short
,
that
despot
,
the
cannon
,
can
not
do
all
that
*NL*
it
desires
;
force
is
a
great
weakness
.
A
cannon-ball
only
travels
*NL*
six
hundred
leagues
an
hour
;
light
travels
seventy
thousand
leagues
a
*NL*
second
.
Such
is
the
superiority
of
Jesus
Christ
over
Napoleon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Reload
your
guns
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
was
the
casing
of
the
barricade
going
to
behave
under
the
*NL*
cannon-balls
?
Would
they
effect
a
breach
?
That
was
the
question
.
While
*NL*
the
insurgents
were
reloading
their
guns
,
the
artillery-men
were
loading
*NL*
the
cannon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
anxiety
in
the
redoubt
was
profound
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shot
sped
the
report
burst
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Present
!
''
shouted
a
joyous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Gavroche
flung
himself
into
the
barricade
just
as
the
ball
dashed
*NL*
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
from
the
direction
of
the
Rue
du
Cygne
,
and
he
had
nimbly
*NL*
climbed
over
the
auxiliary
barricade
which
fronted
on
the
labyrinth
of
*NL*
the
Rue
de
la
Petite
Truanderie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
produced
a
greater
sensation
in
the
barricade
than
the
*NL*
cannon-ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ball
buried
itself
in
the
mass
of
rubbish
.
At
the
most
there
was
an
*NL*
omnibus
wheel
broken
,
and
the
old
Anceau
cart
was
demolished
.
On
seeing
*NL*
this
,
the
barricade
burst
into
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
!
''
shouted
Bossuet
to
the
artillerists
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
ARTILLERY-MEN
COMPEL
PEOPLE
TO
TAKE
THEM
SERIOUSLY
*NL*
*NL*
They
flocked
round
Gavroche
.
But
he
had
no
time
to
tell
anything
.
Marius
*NL*
drew
him
aside
with
a
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
''
said
the
child
,
``
what
are
you
doing
here
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
stared
at
Marius
intently
with
his
epic
effrontery
.
His
eyes
grew
*NL*
larger
with
the
proud
light
within
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
an
accent
of
severity
that
Marius
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
to
come
back
?
Did
you
deliver
my
letter
at
the
address
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
was
not
without
some
compunctions
in
the
matter
of
that
letter
.
*NL*
In
his
haste
to
return
to
the
barricade
,
he
had
got
rid
of
it
rather
*NL*
than
delivered
it
.
He
was
forced
to
acknowledge
to
himself
that
he
had
*NL*
confided
it
rather
lightly
to
that
stranger
whose
face
he
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
make
out
.
It
is
true
that
the
man
was
bareheaded
,
but
that
was
*NL*
not
sufficient
.
In
short
,
he
had
been
administering
to
himself
little
*NL*
inward
remonstrances
and
he
feared
Marius
'
reproaches
.
In
order
to
*NL*
extricate
himself
from
the
predicament
,
he
took
the
simplest
course
;
he
*NL*
lied
abominably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizen
,
I
delivered
the
letter
to
the
porter
.
The
lady
was
asleep
.
She
*NL*
will
have
the
letter
when
she
wakes
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
had
two
objects
in
sending
that
letter
:
to
bid
farewell
to
*NL*
Cosette
and
to
save
Gavroche
.
He
was
obliged
to
content
himself
with
the
*NL*
half
of
his
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
despatch
of
his
letter
and
the
presence
of
M.
Fauchelevent
in
the
*NL*
barricade
,
was
a
coincidence
which
occurred
to
him
.
He
pointed
out
M.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
to
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
that
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
had
,
in
fact
,
as
we
have
just
mentioned
,
seen
Jean
Valjean
only
*NL*
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
troubled
and
unhealthy
conjectures
which
had
outlined
themselves
in
*NL*
Marius
'
mind
were
dissipated
.
Did
he
know
M.
Fauchelevent
's
opinions
?
*NL*
Perhaps
M.
Fauchelevent
was
a
republican
.
Hence
his
very
natural
*NL*
presence
in
this
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
Gavroche
was
shouting
,
at
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
barricade
:
``
My
gun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
had
it
returned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
warned
``
his
comrades
''
as
he
called
them
,
that
the
barricade
was
*NL*
blocked
.
He
had
had
great
difficulty
in
reaching
it
.
A
battalion
of
the
*NL*
line
whose
arms
were
piled
in
the
Rue
de
la
Petite
Truanderie
was
on
*NL*
the
watch
on
the
side
of
the
Rue
du
Cygne
;
on
the
opposite
side
,
the
*NL*
municipal
guard
occupied
the
Rue
des
Precheurs
.
The
bulk
of
the
army
was
*NL*
facing
them
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
information
given
,
Gavroche
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
authorize
you
to
hit
'em
a
tremendous
whack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Enjolras
was
straining
his
ears
and
watching
at
his
*NL*
embrasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assailants
,
dissatisfied
,
no
doubt
,
with
their
shot
,
had
not
*NL*
repeated
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
company
of
infantry
of
the
line
had
come
up
and
occupied
the
end
of
*NL*
the
street
behind
the
piece
of
ordnance
.
The
soldiers
were
tearing
up
*NL*
the
pavement
and
constructing
with
the
stones
a
small
,
low
wall
,
a
*NL*
sort
of
side-work
not
more
than
eighteen
inches
high
,
and
facing
the
*NL*
barricade
.
In
the
angle
at
the
left
of
this
epaulement
,
there
was
*NL*
visible
the
head
of
the
column
of
a
battalion
from
the
suburbs
massed
in
*NL*
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
on
the
watch
,
thought
he
distinguished
the
peculiar
sound
*NL*
which
is
produced
when
the
shells
of
grape-shot
are
drawn
from
the
*NL*
caissons
,
and
he
saw
the
commander
of
the
piece
change
the
elevation
*NL*
and
incline
the
mouth
of
the
cannon
slightly
to
the
left
.
Then
the
*NL*
cannoneers
began
to
load
the
piece
.
The
chief
seized
the
lint-stock
*NL*
himself
and
lowered
it
to
the
vent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Down
with
your
heads
,
hug
the
wall
!
''
shouted
Enjolras
,
``
and
all
on
your
*NL*
knees
along
the
barricade
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurgents
who
were
straggling
in
front
of
the
wine-shop
,
and
*NL*
who
had
quitted
their
posts
of
combat
on
Gavroche
's
arrival
,
rushed
*NL*
pell-mell
towards
the
barricade
;
but
before
Enjolras
'
order
could
be
*NL*
executed
,
the
discharge
took
place
with
the
terrifying
rattle
of
a
round
*NL*
of
grape-shot
.
This
is
what
it
was
,
in
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
charge
had
been
aimed
at
the
cut
in
the
redoubt
,
and
had
there
*NL*
rebounded
from
the
wall
;
and
this
terrible
rebound
had
produced
two
dead
*NL*
and
three
wounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
were
continued
,
the
barricade
was
no
longer
tenable
.
The
*NL*
grape-shot
made
its
way
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
murmur
of
consternation
arose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
prevent
the
second
discharge
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
lowering
his
rifle
,
he
took
aim
at
the
captain
of
the
gun
,
who
,
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
was
bearing
down
on
the
breach
of
his
gun
and
rectifying
*NL*
and
definitely
fixing
its
pointing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
captain
of
the
piece
was
a
handsome
sergeant
of
artillery
,
very
*NL*
young
,
blond
,
with
a
very
gentle
face
,
and
the
intelligent
air
peculiar
*NL*
to
that
predestined
and
redoubtable
weapon
which
,
by
dint
of
perfecting
*NL*
itself
in
horror
,
must
end
in
killing
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
Combeferre
,
who
was
standing
beside
Enjolras
,
scrutinized
this
young
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pity
!
''
said
Combeferre
.
``
What
hideous
things
these
butcheries
*NL*
are
!
Come
,
when
there
are
no
more
kings
,
there
will
be
no
more
war
.
*NL*
Enjolras
,
you
are
taking
aim
at
that
sergeant
,
you
are
not
looking
at
*NL*
him
.
Fancy
,
he
is
a
charming
young
man
;
he
is
intrepid
;
it
is
evident
*NL*
that
he
is
thoughtful
;
those
young
artillery-men
are
very
well
educated
;
*NL*
he
has
a
father
,
a
mother
,
a
family
;
he
is
probably
in
love
;
he
is
not
*NL*
more
than
five
and
twenty
at
the
most
;
he
might
be
your
brother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Combeferre
,
``
he
is
mine
too
.
Well
,
let
us
not
kill
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
alone
.
It
must
be
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
tear
trickled
slowly
down
Enjolras
'
marble
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
moment
,
he
pressed
the
trigger
of
his
rifle
.
The
flame
*NL*
leaped
forth
.
The
artillery-man
turned
round
twice
,
his
arms
extended
in
*NL*
front
of
him
,
his
head
uplifted
,
as
though
for
breath
,
then
he
fell
with
*NL*
his
side
on
the
gun
,
and
lay
there
motionless
.
They
could
see
his
back
,
*NL*
from
the
centre
of
which
there
flowed
directly
a
stream
of
blood
.
The
*NL*
ball
had
traversed
his
breast
from
side
to
side
.
He
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
be
carried
away
and
replaced
by
another
.
Several
minutes
were
*NL*
thus
gained
,
in
fact
.

CHAPTER

--
EMPLOYMENT
OF
THE
OLD
TALENTS
OF
A
POACHER
AND
THAT
*NL*
INFALLIBLE
MARKSMANSHIP
WHICH
INFLUENCED
THE
CONDEMNATION
OF
1796
*NL*
*NL*
Opinions
were
exchanged
in
the
barricade
.
The
firing
from
the
gun
was
*NL*
about
to
begin
again
.
Against
that
grape-shot
,
they
could
not
hold
out
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
longer
.
It
was
absolutely
necessary
to
deaden
the
*NL*
blows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
issued
this
command
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
place
a
mattress
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
none
,
''
said
Combeferre
,
``
the
wounded
are
lying
on
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
seated
apart
on
a
stone
post
,
at
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
tavern
,
with
his
gun
between
his
knees
,
had
,
up
to
that
moment
,
taken
*NL*
no
part
in
anything
that
was
going
on
.
He
did
not
appear
to
hear
the
*NL*
combatants
saying
around
him
:
``
Here
is
a
gun
that
is
doing
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
order
issued
by
Enjolras
,
he
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
that
,
on
the
arrival
of
the
rabble
in
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
an
old
woman
,
foreseeing
the
bullets
,
had
placed
her
*NL*
mattress
in
front
of
her
window
.
This
window
,
an
attic
window
,
was
on
*NL*
the
roof
of
a
six-story
house
situated
a
little
beyond
the
barricade
.
*NL*
The
mattress
,
placed
cross-wise
,
supported
at
the
bottom
on
two
poles
*NL*
for
drying
linen
,
was
upheld
at
the
top
by
two
ropes
,
which
,
at
that
*NL*
distance
,
looked
like
two
threads
,
and
which
were
attached
to
two
nails
*NL*
planted
in
the
window
frames
.
These
ropes
were
distinctly
visible
,
like
*NL*
hairs
,
against
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
some
one
lend
me
a
double-barrelled
rifle
?
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
who
had
just
re-loaded
his
,
handed
it
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
took
aim
at
the
attic
window
and
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
mattress
ropes
was
cut
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mattress
now
hung
by
one
thread
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
fired
the
second
charge
.
The
second
rope
lashed
the
panes
*NL*
of
the
attic
window
.
The
mattress
slipped
between
the
two
poles
and
fell
*NL*
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barricade
applauded
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
voices
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
a
mattress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Combeferre
,
``
but
who
will
go
and
fetch
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mattress
had
,
in
fact
,
fallen
outside
the
barricade
,
between
*NL*
besiegers
and
besieged
.
Now
,
the
death
of
the
sergeant
of
artillery
*NL*
having
exasperated
the
troop
,
the
soldiers
had
,
for
several
minutes
,
*NL*
been
lying
flat
on
their
stomachs
behind
the
line
of
paving-stones
which
*NL*
they
had
erected
,
and
,
in
order
to
supply
the
forced
silence
of
*NL*
the
piece
,
which
was
quiet
while
its
service
was
in
course
of
*NL*
reorganization
,
they
had
opened
fire
on
the
barricade
.
The
insurgents
*NL*
did
not
reply
to
this
musketry
,
in
order
to
spare
their
ammunition
The
*NL*
fusillade
broke
against
the
barricade
;
but
the
street
,
which
it
filled
,
*NL*
was
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stepped
out
of
the
cut
,
entered
the
street
,
traversed
the
*NL*
storm
of
bullets
,
walked
up
to
the
mattress
,
hoisted
it
upon
his
back
,
*NL*
and
returned
to
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
placed
the
mattress
in
the
cut
with
his
own
hands
.
He
fixed
it
there
*NL*
against
the
wall
in
such
a
manner
that
the
artillery-men
should
not
see
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
they
awaited
the
next
discharge
of
grape-shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
long
in
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cannon
vomited
forth
its
package
of
buck-shot
with
a
roar
.
But
there
*NL*
was
no
rebound
.
The
effect
which
they
had
foreseen
had
been
attained
.
*NL*
The
barricade
was
saved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Citizen
,
''
said
Enjolras
to
Jean
Valjean
,
``
the
Republic
thanks
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
admired
and
laughed
.
He
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
immoral
that
a
mattress
should
have
so
much
power
.
Triumph
of
*NL*
that
which
yields
over
that
which
strikes
with
lightning
.
But
never
*NL*
mind
,
glory
to
the
mattress
which
annuls
a
cannon
!

CHAPTER
X
--
DAWN
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
Cosette
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
chamber
was
narrow
,
neat
,
unobtrusive
,
with
a
long
sash-window
,
*NL*
facing
the
East
on
the
back
court-yard
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
knew
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
in
Paris
.
She
had
not
been
*NL*
there
on
the
preceding
evening
,
and
she
had
already
retired
to
her
*NL*
chamber
when
Toussaint
had
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
that
there
is
a
row
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
slept
only
a
few
hours
,
but
soundly
.
She
had
had
sweet
*NL*
dreams
,
which
possibly
arose
from
the
fact
that
her
little
bed
was
very
*NL*
white
.
Some
one
,
who
was
Marius
,
had
appeared
to
her
in
the
light
.
She
*NL*
awoke
with
the
sun
in
her
eyes
,
which
,
at
first
,
produced
on
her
the
*NL*
effect
of
being
a
continuation
of
her
dream
.
Her
first
thought
on
*NL*
emerging
from
this
dream
was
a
smiling
one
.
Cosette
felt
herself
*NL*
thoroughly
reassured
.
Like
Jean
Valjean
,
she
had
,
a
few
hours
*NL*
previously
,
passed
through
that
reaction
of
the
soul
which
absolutely
*NL*
will
not
hear
of
unhappiness
.
She
began
to
cherish
hope
,
with
all
her
*NL*
might
,
without
knowing
why
.
Then
she
felt
a
pang
at
her
heart
.
It
was
*NL*
three
days
since
she
had
seen
Marius
.
But
she
said
to
herself
that
he
*NL*
must
have
received
her
letter
,
that
he
knew
where
she
was
,
and
that
*NL*
he
was
so
clever
that
he
would
find
means
of
reaching
her
.
--
And
that
*NL*
certainly
to-day
,
and
perhaps
that
very
morning
.
--
It
was
broad
daylight
,
*NL*
but
the
rays
of
light
were
very
horizontal
;
she
thought
that
it
was
very
*NL*
early
,
but
that
she
must
rise
,
nevertheless
,
in
order
to
receive
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
that
she
could
not
live
without
Marius
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
*NL*
that
was
sufficient
and
that
Marius
would
come
.
No
objection
was
valid
.
*NL*
All
this
was
certain
.
It
was
monstrous
enough
already
to
have
suffered
*NL*
for
three
days
.
Marius
absent
three
days
,
this
was
horrible
on
the
part
*NL*
of
the
good
God
.
Now
,
this
cruel
teasing
from
on
high
had
been
gone
*NL*
through
with
.
Marius
was
about
to
arrive
,
and
he
would
bring
good
news
.
*NL*
Youth
is
made
thus
;
it
quickly
dries
its
eyes
;
it
finds
sorrow
useless
*NL*
and
does
not
accept
it
.
Youth
is
the
smile
of
the
future
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
an
unknown
quantity
,
which
is
itself
.
It
is
natural
to
it
to
be
*NL*
happy
.
It
seems
as
though
its
respiration
were
made
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Cosette
could
not
remember
what
Marius
had
said
to
her
on
*NL*
the
subject
of
this
absence
which
was
to
last
only
one
day
,
and
what
*NL*
explanation
of
it
he
had
given
her
.
Every
one
has
noticed
with
what
*NL*
nimbleness
a
coin
which
one
has
dropped
on
the
ground
rolls
away
and
*NL*
hides
,
and
with
what
art
it
renders
itself
undiscoverable
.
There
are
*NL*
thoughts
which
play
us
the
same
trick
;
they
nestle
away
in
a
corner
of
*NL*
our
brain
;
that
is
the
end
of
them
;
they
are
lost
;
it
is
impossible
to
*NL*
lay
the
memory
on
them
.
Cosette
was
somewhat
vexed
at
the
useless
little
*NL*
effort
made
by
her
memory
.
She
told
herself
,
that
it
was
very
naughty
*NL*
and
very
wicked
of
her
,
to
have
forgotten
the
words
uttered
by
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
out
of
bed
and
accomplished
the
two
ablutions
of
soul
and
*NL*
body
,
her
prayers
and
her
toilet
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
may
,
in
a
case
of
exigency
,
introduce
the
reader
into
a
nuptial
*NL*
chamber
,
not
into
a
virginal
chamber
.
Verse
would
hardly
venture
it
,
*NL*
prose
must
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
the
interior
of
a
flower
that
is
not
yet
unfolded
,
it
is
whiteness
*NL*
in
the
dark
,
it
is
the
private
cell
of
a
closed
lily
,
which
must
not
be
*NL*
gazed
upon
by
man
so
long
as
the
sun
has
not
gazed
upon
it
.
Woman
in
the
*NL*
bud
is
sacred
.
That
innocent
bud
which
opens
,
that
adorable
half-nudity
*NL*
which
is
afraid
of
itself
,
that
white
foot
which
takes
refuge
in
a
*NL*
slipper
,
that
throat
which
veils
itself
before
a
mirror
as
though
*NL*
a
mirror
were
an
eye
,
that
chemise
which
makes
haste
to
rise
up
and
*NL*
conceal
the
shoulder
for
a
creaking
bit
of
furniture
or
a
passing
*NL*
vehicle
,
those
cords
tied
,
those
clasps
fastened
,
those
laces
drawn
,
*NL*
those
tremors
,
those
shivers
of
cold
and
modesty
,
that
exquisite
*NL*
affright
in
every
movement
,
that
almost
winged
uneasiness
where
there
*NL*
is
no
cause
for
alarm
,
the
successive
phases
of
dressing
,
as
charming
as
*NL*
the
clouds
of
dawn
,
--
it
is
not
fitting
that
all
this
should
be
narrated
,
*NL*
and
it
is
too
much
to
have
even
called
attention
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eye
of
man
must
be
more
religious
in
the
presence
of
the
rising
of
a
*NL*
young
girl
than
in
the
presence
of
the
rising
of
a
star
.
The
possibility
*NL*
of
hurting
should
inspire
an
augmentation
of
respect
.
The
down
on
the
*NL*
peach
,
the
bloom
on
the
plum
,
the
radiated
crystal
of
the
snow
,
the
wing
*NL*
of
the
butterfly
powdered
with
feathers
,
are
coarse
compared
to
that
*NL*
chastity
which
does
not
even
know
that
it
is
chaste
.
The
young
girl
is
*NL*
only
the
flash
of
a
dream
,
and
is
not
yet
a
statue
.
Her
bed-chamber
is
*NL*
hidden
in
the
sombre
part
of
the
ideal
.
The
indiscreet
touch
of
a
glance
*NL*
brutalizes
this
vague
penumbra
.
Here
,
contemplation
is
profanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
shall
,
therefore
,
show
nothing
of
that
sweet
little
flutter
of
*NL*
Cosette
's
rising
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
oriental
tale
relates
how
the
rose
was
made
white
by
God
,
but
that
*NL*
Adam
looked
upon
her
when
she
was
unfolding
,
and
she
was
ashamed
and
*NL*
turned
crimson
.
We
are
of
the
number
who
fall
speechless
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
young
girls
and
flowers
,
since
we
think
them
worthy
of
veneration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
dressed
herself
very
hastily
,
combed
and
dressed
her
hair
,
which
*NL*
was
a
very
simple
matter
in
those
days
,
when
women
did
not
swell
out
*NL*
their
curls
and
bands
with
cushions
and
puffs
,
and
did
not
put
crinoline
*NL*
in
their
locks
.
Then
she
opened
the
window
and
cast
her
eyes
around
her
*NL*
in
every
direction
,
hoping
to
descry
some
bit
of
the
street
,
an
angle
of
*NL*
the
house
,
an
edge
of
pavement
,
so
that
she
might
be
able
to
watch
for
*NL*
Marius
there
.
But
no
view
of
the
outside
was
to
be
had
.
The
back
court
*NL*
was
surrounded
by
tolerably
high
walls
,
and
the
outlook
was
only
on
*NL*
several
gardens
.
Cosette
pronounced
these
gardens
hideous
:
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
her
life
,
she
found
flowers
ugly
.
The
smallest
scrap
of
the
*NL*
gutter
of
the
street
would
have
met
her
wishes
better
.
She
decided
to
*NL*
gaze
at
the
sky
,
as
though
she
thought
that
Marius
might
come
from
that
*NL*
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
she
burst
into
tears
.
Not
that
this
was
fickleness
of
*NL*
soul
;
but
hopes
cut
in
twain
by
dejection
--
that
was
her
case
.
She
had
a
*NL*
confused
consciousness
of
something
horrible
.
Thoughts
were
rife
in
the
*NL*
air
,
in
fact
.
She
told
herself
that
she
was
not
sure
of
anything
,
that
*NL*
to
withdraw
herself
from
sight
was
to
be
lost
;
and
the
idea
that
Marius
*NL*
could
return
to
her
from
heaven
appeared
to
her
no
longer
charming
but
*NL*
mournful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
as
is
the
nature
of
these
clouds
,
calm
returned
to
her
,
and
hope
*NL*
and
a
sort
of
unconscious
smile
,
which
yet
indicated
trust
in
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
in
the
house
was
still
asleep
.
A
country-like
silence
reigned
.
*NL*
Not
a
shutter
had
been
opened
.
The
porter
's
lodge
was
closed
.
Toussaint
*NL*
had
not
risen
,
and
Cosette
,
naturally
,
thought
that
her
father
was
*NL*
asleep
.
She
must
have
suffered
much
,
and
she
must
have
still
been
*NL*
suffering
greatly
,
for
she
said
to
herself
,
that
her
father
had
been
*NL*
unkind
;
but
she
counted
on
Marius
.
The
eclipse
of
such
a
light
was
*NL*
decidedly
impossible
.
Now
and
then
,
she
heard
sharp
shocks
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
and
she
said
:
``
It
is
odd
that
people
should
be
opening
and
*NL*
shutting
their
carriage
gates
so
early
.
''
They
were
the
reports
of
the
*NL*
cannon
battering
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
feet
below
Cosette
's
window
,
in
the
ancient
and
perfectly
black
*NL*
cornice
of
the
wall
,
there
was
a
martin
's
nest
;
the
curve
of
this
nest
*NL*
formed
a
little
projection
beyond
the
cornice
,
so
that
from
above
it
*NL*
was
possible
to
look
into
this
little
paradise
.
The
mother
was
there
,
*NL*
spreading
her
wings
like
a
fan
over
her
brood
;
the
father
fluttered
*NL*
about
,
flew
away
,
then
came
back
,
bearing
in
his
beak
food
and
kisses
.
*NL*
The
dawning
day
gilded
this
happy
thing
,
the
great
law
,
``
Multiply
,
''
lay
*NL*
there
smiling
and
august
,
and
that
sweet
mystery
unfolded
in
the
*NL*
glory
of
the
morning
.
Cosette
,
with
her
hair
in
the
sunlight
,
her
*NL*
soul
absorbed
in
chimeras
,
illuminated
by
love
within
and
by
the
dawn
*NL*
without
,
bent
over
mechanically
,
and
almost
without
daring
to
avow
to
*NL*
herself
that
she
was
thinking
at
the
same
time
of
Marius
,
began
to
gaze
*NL*
at
these
birds
,
at
this
family
,
at
that
male
and
female
,
that
mother
and
*NL*
her
little
ones
,
with
the
profound
trouble
which
a
nest
produces
on
a
*NL*
virgin
.

CHAPTER
XI
--
THE
SHOT
WHICH
MISSES
NOTHING
AND
KILLS
NO
ONE
*NL*
*NL*
The
assailants
'
fire
continued
.
Musketry
and
grape-shot
alternated
,
but
*NL*
without
committing
great
ravages
,
to
tell
the
truth
.
The
top
alone
of
*NL*
the
Corinthe
facade
suffered
;
the
window
on
the
first
floor
,
and
the
*NL*
attic
window
in
the
roof
,
riddled
with
buck-shot
and
biscaiens
,
were
*NL*
slowly
losing
their
shape
.
The
combatants
who
had
been
posted
there
had
*NL*
been
obliged
to
withdraw
.
However
,
this
is
according
to
the
tactics
*NL*
of
barricades
;
to
fire
for
a
long
while
,
in
order
to
exhaust
the
*NL*
insurgents
'
ammunition
,
if
they
commit
the
mistake
of
replying
.
When
it
*NL*
is
perceived
,
from
the
slackening
of
their
fire
,
that
they
have
no
more
*NL*
powder
and
ball
,
the
assault
is
made
.
Enjolras
had
not
fallen
into
this
*NL*
trap
;
the
barricade
did
not
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
every
discharge
by
platoons
,
Gavroche
puffed
out
his
cheek
with
his
*NL*
tongue
,
a
sign
of
supreme
disdain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
for
you
,
''
said
he
,
``
rip
up
the
cloth
.
We
want
some
lint
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
called
the
grape-shot
to
order
for
the
little
effect
which
it
*NL*
produced
,
and
said
to
the
cannon
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
growing
diffuse
,
my
good
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
gets
puzzled
in
battle
,
as
at
a
ball
.
It
is
probable
that
this
*NL*
silence
on
the
part
of
the
redoubt
began
to
render
the
besiegers
uneasy
,
*NL*
and
to
make
them
fear
some
unexpected
incident
,
and
that
they
felt
the
*NL*
necessity
of
getting
a
clear
view
behind
that
heap
of
paving-stones
,
and
*NL*
of
knowing
what
was
going
on
behind
that
impassable
wall
which
received
*NL*
blows
without
retorting
.
The
insurgents
suddenly
perceived
a
helmet
*NL*
glittering
in
the
sun
on
a
neighboring
roof
.
A
fireman
had
placed
his
*NL*
back
against
a
tall
chimney
,
and
seemed
to
be
acting
as
sentinel
.
His
*NL*
glance
fell
directly
down
into
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
an
embarrassing
watcher
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
returned
Enjolras
'
rifle
,
but
he
had
his
own
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
saying
a
word
,
he
took
aim
at
the
fireman
,
and
,
a
second
later
,
*NL*
the
helmet
,
smashed
by
a
bullet
,
rattled
noisily
into
the
street
.
The
*NL*
terrified
soldier
made
haste
to
disappear
.
A
second
observer
took
his
*NL*
place
.
This
one
was
an
officer
.
Jean
Valjean
,
who
had
re-loaded
his
*NL*
gun
,
took
aim
at
the
newcomer
and
sent
the
officer
's
casque
to
join
the
*NL*
soldier
's
.
The
officer
did
not
persist
,
and
retired
speedily
.
This
time
*NL*
the
warning
was
understood
.
No
one
made
his
appearance
thereafter
on
*NL*
that
roof
;
and
the
idea
of
spying
on
the
barricade
was
abandoned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
you
not
kill
the
man
?
''
Bossuet
asked
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
made
no
reply
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
DISORDER
A
PARTISAN
OF
ORDER
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
muttered
in
Combeferre
's
ear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
answer
my
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
man
who
does
good
by
gun-shots
,
''
said
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
have
preserved
some
memory
of
this
already
distant
epoch
*NL*
know
that
the
National
Guard
from
the
suburbs
was
valiant
against
*NL*
insurrections
.
It
was
particularly
zealous
and
intrepid
in
the
days
of
*NL*
June
,
1832
.
A
certain
good
dram-shop
keeper
of
Pantin
des
Vertus
or
*NL*
la
Cunette
,
whose
``
establishment
''
had
been
closed
by
the
riots
,
became
*NL*
leonine
at
the
sight
of
his
deserted
dance-hall
,
and
got
himself
killed
*NL*
to
preserve
the
order
represented
by
a
tea-garden
.
In
that
bourgeois
and
*NL*
heroic
time
,
in
the
presence
of
ideas
which
had
their
knights
,
interests
*NL*
had
their
paladins
.
The
prosiness
of
the
originators
detracted
nothing
*NL*
from
the
bravery
of
the
movement
.
The
diminution
of
a
pile
of
crowns
*NL*
made
bankers
sing
the
Marseillaise
.
They
shed
their
blood
lyrically
for
*NL*
the
counting-house
;
and
they
defended
the
shop
,
that
immense
diminutive
*NL*
of
the
fatherland
,
with
Lacedaemonian
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
bottom
,
we
will
observe
,
there
was
nothing
in
all
this
that
was
not
*NL*
extremely
serious
.
It
was
social
elements
entering
into
strife
,
while
*NL*
awaiting
the
day
when
they
should
enter
into
equilibrium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
sign
of
the
times
was
the
anarchy
mingled
with
governmentalism
*NL*
-LSB-
the
barbarous
name
of
the
correct
party
-RSB-
.
People
were
for
order
in
*NL*
combination
with
lack
of
discipline
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drum
suddenly
beat
capricious
calls
,
at
the
command
of
such
or
*NL*
such
a
Colonel
of
the
National
Guard
;
such
and
such
a
captain
went
into
*NL*
action
through
inspiration
;
such
and
such
National
Guardsmen
fought
,
*NL*
``
for
an
idea
,
''
and
on
their
own
account
.
At
critical
moments
,
on
``
days
''
*NL*
they
took
counsel
less
of
their
leaders
than
of
their
instincts
.
There
*NL*
existed
in
the
army
of
order
,
veritable
guerilleros
,
some
of
the
sword
,
*NL*
like
Fannicot
,
others
of
the
pen
,
like
Henri
Fonfrede
.
*NL*
*NL*
Civilization
,
unfortunately
,
represented
at
this
epoch
rather
by
an
*NL*
aggregation
of
interests
than
by
a
group
of
principles
,
was
or
thought
*NL*
itself
,
in
peril
;
it
set
up
the
cry
of
alarm
;
each
,
constituting
himself
*NL*
a
centre
,
defended
it
,
succored
it
,
and
protected
it
with
his
own
head
;
*NL*
and
the
first
comer
took
it
upon
himself
to
save
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Zeal
sometimes
proceeded
to
extermination
.
A
platoon
of
the
National
*NL*
Guard
would
constitute
itself
on
its
own
authority
a
private
council
of
*NL*
war
,
and
judge
and
execute
a
captured
insurgent
in
five
minutes
.
It
*NL*
was
an
improvisation
of
this
sort
that
had
slain
Jean
Prouvaire
.
Fierce
*NL*
Lynch
law
,
with
which
no
one
party
had
any
right
to
reproach
the
rest
,
*NL*
for
it
has
been
applied
by
the
Republic
in
America
,
as
well
as
by
the
*NL*
monarchy
in
Europe
.
This
Lynch
law
was
complicated
with
mistakes
.
On
one
*NL*
day
of
rioting
,
a
young
poet
,
named
Paul
Aime
Garnier
,
was
pursued
*NL*
in
the
Place
Royale
,
with
a
bayonet
at
his
loins
,
and
only
escaped
by
*NL*
taking
refuge
under
the
porte-cochere
of
No.
6
.
They
shouted
:
--
``
There
's
*NL*
another
of
those
Saint-Simonians
!
''
and
they
wanted
to
kill
him
.
Now
,
he
*NL*
had
under
his
arm
a
volume
of
the
memoirs
of
the
Duc
de
Saint-Simon
.
*NL*
A
National
Guard
had
read
the
words
Saint-Simon
on
the
book
,
and
had
*NL*
shouted
:
``
Death
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
6th
of
June
,
1832
,
a
company
of
the
National
Guards
from
the
*NL*
suburbs
,
commanded
by
the
Captain
Fannicot
,
above
mentioned
,
had
itself
*NL*
decimated
in
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
out
of
caprice
and
its
own
good
*NL*
pleasure
.
This
fact
,
singular
though
it
may
seem
,
was
proved
at
the
*NL*
judicial
investigation
opened
in
consequence
of
the
insurrection
of
*NL*
1832
.
Captain
Fannicot
,
a
bold
and
impatient
bourgeois
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
condottiere
of
the
order
of
those
whom
we
have
just
characterized
,
*NL*
a
fanatical
and
intractable
governmentalist
,
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
temptation
to
fire
prematurely
,
and
the
ambition
of
capturing
the
*NL*
barricade
alone
and
unaided
,
that
is
to
say
,
with
his
company
.
*NL*
Exasperated
by
the
successive
apparition
of
the
red
flag
and
the
old
*NL*
coat
which
he
took
for
the
black
flag
,
he
loudly
blamed
the
generals
and
*NL*
chiefs
of
the
corps
,
who
were
holding
council
and
did
not
think
that
the
*NL*
moment
for
the
decisive
assault
had
arrived
,
and
who
were
allowing
``
the
*NL*
insurrection
to
fry
in
its
own
fat
,
''
to
use
the
celebrated
expression
*NL*
of
one
of
them
.
For
his
part
,
he
thought
the
barricade
ripe
,
and
as
that
*NL*
which
is
ripe
ought
to
fall
,
he
made
the
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
commanded
men
as
resolute
as
himself
,
``
raging
fellows
,
''
as
a
witness
*NL*
said
.
His
company
,
the
same
which
had
shot
Jean
Prouvaire
the
poet
,
was
*NL*
the
first
of
the
battalion
posted
at
the
angle
of
the
street
.
At
the
*NL*
moment
when
they
were
least
expecting
it
,
the
captain
launched
his
men
*NL*
against
the
barricade
.
This
movement
,
executed
with
more
good
will
than
*NL*
strategy
,
cost
the
Fannicot
company
dear
.
Before
it
had
traversed
two
*NL*
thirds
of
the
street
it
was
received
by
a
general
discharge
from
the
*NL*
barricade
.
Four
,
the
most
audacious
,
who
were
running
on
in
front
,
*NL*
were
mown
down
point-blank
at
the
very
foot
of
the
redoubt
,
and
this
*NL*
courageous
throng
of
National
Guards
,
very
brave
men
but
lacking
in
*NL*
military
tenacity
,
were
forced
to
fall
back
,
after
some
hesitation
,
*NL*
leaving
fifteen
corpses
on
the
pavement
.
This
momentary
hesitation
gave
*NL*
the
insurgents
time
to
re-load
their
weapons
,
and
a
second
and
very
*NL*
destructive
discharge
struck
the
company
before
it
could
regain
the
*NL*
corner
of
the
street
,
its
shelter
.
A
moment
more
,
and
it
was
caught
*NL*
between
two
fires
,
and
it
received
the
volley
from
the
battery
piece
*NL*
which
,
not
having
received
the
order
,
had
not
discontinued
its
firing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intrepid
and
imprudent
Fannicot
was
one
of
the
dead
from
this
*NL*
grape-shot
.
He
was
killed
by
the
cannon
,
that
is
to
say
,
by
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
attack
,
which
was
more
furious
than
serious
,
irritated
*NL*
Enjolras
.
--
``
The
fools
!
''
said
he
.
``
They
are
getting
their
own
men
killed
*NL*
and
they
are
using
up
our
ammunition
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
spoke
like
the
real
general
of
insurrection
which
he
*NL*
was
.
Insurrection
and
repression
do
not
fight
with
equal
weapons
.
*NL*
Insurrection
,
which
is
speedily
exhausted
,
has
only
a
certain
number
*NL*
of
shots
to
fire
and
a
certain
number
of
combatants
to
expend
.
An
empty
*NL*
cartridge-box
,
a
man
killed
,
can
not
be
replaced
.
As
repression
has
the
*NL*
army
,
it
does
not
count
its
men
,
and
,
as
it
has
Vincennes
,
it
does
not
*NL*
count
its
shots
.
Repression
has
as
many
regiments
as
the
barricade
has
*NL*
men
,
and
as
many
arsenals
as
the
barricade
has
cartridge-boxes
.
Thus
*NL*
they
are
struggles
of
one
against
a
hundred
,
which
always
end
in
*NL*
crushing
the
barricade
;
unless
the
revolution
,
uprising
suddenly
,
*NL*
flings
into
the
balance
its
flaming
archangel
's
sword
.
This
does
happen
*NL*
sometimes
.
Then
everything
rises
,
the
pavements
begin
to
seethe
,
popular
*NL*
redoubts
abound
.
Paris
quivers
supremely
,
the
quid
divinum
is
given
*NL*
forth
,
a
10th
of
August
is
in
the
air
,
a
29th
of
July
is
in
the
air
,
a
*NL*
wonderful
light
appears
,
the
yawning
maw
of
force
draws
back
,
and
the
*NL*
army
,
that
lion
,
sees
before
it
,
erect
and
tranquil
,
that
prophet
,
*NL*
France

CHAPTER
XIII
--
PASSING
GLEAMS
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
chaos
of
sentiments
and
passions
which
defend
a
barricade
,
there
*NL*
is
a
little
of
everything
;
there
is
bravery
,
there
is
youth
,
honor
,
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
the
ideal
,
conviction
,
the
rage
of
the
gambler
,
and
,
above
*NL*
all
,
intermittences
of
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
these
intermittences
,
one
of
these
vague
quivers
of
hope
suddenly
*NL*
traversed
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
it
was
least
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
''
suddenly
cried
Enjolras
,
who
was
still
on
the
watch
,
``
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
that
Paris
is
waking
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
certain
that
,
on
the
morning
of
the
6th
of
June
,
the
insurrection
*NL*
broke
out
afresh
for
an
hour
or
two
,
to
a
certain
extent
.
The
obstinacy
*NL*
of
the
alarm
peal
of
Saint-Merry
reanimated
some
fancies
.
Barricades
*NL*
were
begun
in
the
Rue
du
Poirier
and
the
Rue
des
Gravilliers
.
In
front
*NL*
of
the
Porte
Saint-Martin
,
a
young
man
,
armed
with
a
rifle
,
attacked
*NL*
alone
a
squadron
of
cavalry
.
In
plain
sight
,
on
the
open
boulevard
,
he
*NL*
placed
one
knee
on
the
ground
,
shouldered
his
weapon
,
fired
,
killed
the
*NL*
commander
of
the
squadron
,
and
turned
away
,
saying
:
``
There
's
another
who
*NL*
will
do
us
no
more
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
put
to
the
sword
.
In
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
a
woman
fired
on
the
*NL*
National
Guard
from
behind
a
lowered
blind
.
The
slats
of
the
blind
could
*NL*
be
seen
to
tremble
at
every
shot
.
A
child
fourteen
years
of
age
*NL*
was
arrested
in
the
Rue
de
la
Cossonerie
,
with
his
pockets
full
of
*NL*
cartridges
.
Many
posts
were
attacked
.
At
the
entrance
to
the
Rue
*NL*
Bertin-Poiree
,
a
very
lively
and
utterly
unexpected
fusillade
welcomed
*NL*
a
regiment
of
cuirrassiers
,
at
whose
head
marched
Marshal
General
*NL*
Cavaignac
de
Barague
.
In
the
Rue
Planche-Mibray
,
they
threw
old
pieces
*NL*
of
pottery
and
household
utensils
down
on
the
soldiers
from
the
roofs
;
a
*NL*
bad
sign
;
and
when
this
matter
was
reported
to
Marshal
Soult
,
Napoleon
's
*NL*
old
lieutenant
grew
thoughtful
,
as
he
recalled
Suchet
's
saying
at
*NL*
Saragossa
:
``
We
are
lost
when
the
old
women
empty
their
pots
de
chambre
*NL*
on
our
heads
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
general
symptoms
which
presented
themselves
at
the
moment
when
*NL*
it
was
thought
that
the
uprising
had
been
rendered
local
,
this
fever
*NL*
of
wrath
,
these
sparks
which
flew
hither
and
thither
above
those
deep
*NL*
masses
of
combustibles
which
are
called
the
faubourgs
of
Paris
,
--
all
*NL*
this
,
taken
together
,
disturbed
the
military
chiefs
.
They
made
haste
to
*NL*
stamp
out
these
beginnings
of
conflagration
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
delayed
the
attack
on
the
barricades
Maubuee
,
de
la
Chanvrerie
and
*NL*
Saint-Merry
until
these
sparks
had
been
extinguished
,
in
order
that
they
*NL*
might
have
to
deal
with
the
barricades
only
and
be
able
to
finish
*NL*
them
at
one
blow
.
Columns
were
thrown
into
the
streets
where
there
was
*NL*
fermentation
,
sweeping
the
large
,
sounding
the
small
,
right
and
left
,
*NL*
now
slowly
and
cautiously
,
now
at
full
charge
.
The
troops
broke
in
*NL*
the
doors
of
houses
whence
shots
had
been
fired
;
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
manoeuvres
by
the
cavalry
dispersed
the
groups
on
the
boulevards
.
This
*NL*
repression
was
not
effected
without
some
commotion
,
and
without
that
*NL*
tumultuous
uproar
peculiar
to
collisions
between
the
army
and
the
*NL*
people
.
This
was
what
Enjolras
had
caught
in
the
intervals
of
the
*NL*
cannonade
and
the
musketry
.
Moreover
,
he
had
seen
wounded
men
passing
*NL*
the
end
of
the
street
in
litters
,
and
he
said
to
Courfeyrac
:
--
``
Those
*NL*
wounded
do
not
come
from
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Their
hope
did
not
last
long
;
the
gleam
was
quickly
eclipsed
.
In
less
*NL*
than
half
an
hour
,
what
was
in
the
air
vanished
,
it
was
a
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
unaccompanied
by
thunder
,
and
the
insurgents
felt
that
sort
of
*NL*
leaden
cope
,
which
the
indifference
of
the
people
casts
over
obstinate
*NL*
and
deserted
men
,
fall
over
them
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
general
movement
,
which
seemed
to
have
assumed
a
vague
outline
,
had
*NL*
miscarried
;
and
the
attention
of
the
minister
of
war
and
the
strategy
of
*NL*
the
generals
could
now
be
concentrated
on
the
three
or
four
barricades
*NL*
which
still
remained
standing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
was
mounting
above
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
insurgent
hailed
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
hungry
here
.
Are
we
really
going
to
die
like
this
,
without
*NL*
anything
to
eat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
who
was
still
leaning
on
his
elbows
at
his
embrasure
,
made
an
*NL*
affirmative
sign
with
his
head
,
but
without
taking
his
eyes
from
the
end
*NL*
of
the
street
.

CHAPTER
XIV
--
WHEREIN
WILL
APPEAR
THE
NAME
OF
ENJOLRAS
'
MISTRESS
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
,
seated
on
a
paving-stone
beside
Enjolras
,
continued
to
*NL*
insult
the
cannon
,
and
each
time
that
that
gloomy
cloud
of
projectiles
*NL*
which
is
called
grape-shot
passed
overhead
with
its
terrible
sound
he
*NL*
assailed
it
with
a
burst
of
irony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
wearing
out
your
lungs
,
poor
,
brutal
,
old
fellow
,
you
pain
me
,
*NL*
you
are
wasting
your
row
.
That
's
not
thunder
,
it
's
a
cough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
bystanders
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
and
Bossuet
,
whose
brave
good
humor
increased
with
the
peril
,
*NL*
like
Madame
Scarron
,
replaced
nourishment
with
pleasantry
,
and
,
as
wine
*NL*
was
lacking
,
they
poured
out
gayety
to
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admire
Enjolras
,
''
said
Bossuet
.
``
His
impassive
temerity
astounds
*NL*
me
.
He
lives
alone
,
which
renders
him
a
little
sad
,
perhaps
;
Enjolras
*NL*
complains
of
his
greatness
,
which
binds
him
to
widowhood
.
The
rest
of
us
*NL*
have
mistresses
,
more
or
less
,
who
make
us
crazy
,
that
is
to
say
,
brave
.
*NL*
When
a
man
is
as
much
in
love
as
a
tiger
,
the
least
that
he
can
do
is
to
*NL*
fight
like
a
lion
.
That
is
one
way
of
taking
our
revenge
for
the
capers
*NL*
that
mesdames
our
grisettes
play
on
us
.
Roland
gets
himself
killed
for
*NL*
Angelique
;
all
our
heroism
comes
from
our
women
.
A
man
without
a
woman
*NL*
is
a
pistol
without
a
trigger
;
it
is
the
woman
that
sets
the
man
off
.
*NL*
Well
,
Enjolras
has
no
woman
.
He
is
not
in
love
,
and
yet
he
manages
to
be
*NL*
intrepid
.
It
is
a
thing
unheard
of
that
a
man
should
be
as
cold
as
ice
*NL*
and
as
bold
as
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
did
not
appear
to
be
listening
,
but
had
any
one
been
near
him
,
*NL*
that
person
would
have
heard
him
mutter
in
a
low
voice
:
``
Patria
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
was
still
laughing
when
Courfeyrac
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
News
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
assuming
the
tone
of
an
usher
making
an
announcement
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Eight-Pounder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
,
a
new
personage
had
entered
on
the
scene
.
This
was
a
second
*NL*
piece
of
ordnance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
artillery-men
rapidly
performed
their
manoeuvres
in
force
and
placed
*NL*
this
second
piece
in
line
with
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
outlined
the
catastrophe
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
,
the
two
pieces
,
rapidly
served
,
were
firing
*NL*
point-blank
at
the
redoubt
;
the
platoon
firing
of
the
line
and
of
the
*NL*
soldiers
from
the
suburbs
sustained
the
artillery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
cannonade
was
audible
at
some
distance
.
At
the
same
time
that
*NL*
the
two
guns
were
furiously
attacking
the
redoubt
from
the
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Chanvrerie
,
two
other
cannons
,
trained
one
from
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
*NL*
the
other
from
the
Rue
Aubry-le-Boucher
,
were
riddling
the
Saint-Merry
*NL*
barricade
.
The
four
cannons
echoed
each
other
mournfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barking
of
these
sombre
dogs
of
war
replied
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
two
pieces
which
was
now
battering
the
barricade
on
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Chanvrerie
was
firing
grape-shot
,
the
other
balls
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
piece
which
was
firing
balls
was
pointed
a
little
high
,
and
the
aim
*NL*
was
calculated
so
that
the
ball
struck
the
extreme
edge
of
the
upper
*NL*
crest
of
the
barricade
,
and
crumbled
the
stone
down
upon
the
insurgents
,
*NL*
mingled
with
bursts
of
grape-shot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
object
of
this
mode
of
firing
was
to
drive
the
insurgents
from
*NL*
the
summit
of
the
redoubt
,
and
to
compel
them
to
gather
close
in
the
*NL*
interior
,
that
is
to
say
,
this
announced
the
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
combatants
once
driven
from
the
crest
of
the
barricade
by
balls
,
*NL*
and
from
the
windows
of
the
cabaret
by
grape-shot
,
the
attacking
columns
*NL*
could
venture
into
the
street
without
being
picked
off
,
perhaps
,
even
,
*NL*
without
being
seen
,
could
briskly
and
suddenly
scale
the
redoubt
,
as
on
*NL*
the
preceding
evening
,
and
,
who
knows
?
take
it
by
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
absolutely
necessary
that
the
inconvenience
of
those
guns
*NL*
should
be
diminished
,
''
said
Enjolras
,
and
he
shouted
:
``
Fire
on
the
*NL*
artillery-men
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
ready
.
The
barricade
,
which
had
long
been
silent
,
poured
forth
*NL*
a
desperate
fire
;
seven
or
eight
discharges
followed
,
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
rage
and
joy
;
the
street
was
filled
with
blinding
smoke
,
and
,
at
the
end
*NL*
of
a
few
minutes
,
athwart
this
mist
all
streaked
with
flame
,
two
thirds
*NL*
of
the
gunners
could
be
distinguished
lying
beneath
the
wheels
of
the
*NL*
cannons
.
Those
who
were
left
standing
continued
to
serve
the
pieces
with
*NL*
severe
tranquillity
,
but
the
fire
had
slackened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Things
are
going
well
now
,
''
said
Bossuet
to
Enjolras
.
``
Success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
shook
his
head
and
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
quarter
of
an
hour
of
this
success
,
and
there
will
not
be
any
*NL*
cartridges
left
in
the
barricade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appears
that
Gavroche
overheard
this
remark
.

CHAPTER
XV
--
GAVROCHE
OUTSIDE
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
suddenly
caught
sight
of
some
one
at
the
base
of
the
*NL*
barricade
,
outside
in
the
street
,
amid
the
bullets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
had
taken
a
bottle
basket
from
the
wine-shop
,
had
made
his
*NL*
way
out
through
the
cut
,
and
was
quietly
engaged
in
emptying
the
full
*NL*
cartridge-boxes
of
the
National
Guardsmen
who
had
been
killed
on
the
*NL*
slope
of
the
redoubt
,
into
his
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
there
?
''
asked
Courfeyrac
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
raised
his
face
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
filling
my
basket
,
citizen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
see
the
grape-shot
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
is
raining
.
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
shouted
:
--
``
Come
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Instanter
,
''
said
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
a
single
bound
he
plunged
into
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
remembered
that
Fannicot
's
company
had
left
behind
it
a
trail
*NL*
of
bodies
.
Twenty
corpses
lay
scattered
here
and
there
on
the
pavement
,
*NL*
through
the
whole
length
of
the
street
.
Twenty
cartouches
for
Gavroche
*NL*
meant
a
provision
of
cartridges
for
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smoke
in
the
street
was
like
a
fog
.
Whoever
has
beheld
a
cloud
which
*NL*
has
fallen
into
a
mountain
gorge
between
two
peaked
escarpments
can
*NL*
imagine
this
smoke
rendered
denser
and
thicker
by
two
gloomy
rows
of
*NL*
lofty
houses
.
It
rose
gradually
and
was
incessantly
renewed
;
hence
a
*NL*
twilight
which
made
even
the
broad
daylight
turn
pale
.
The
combatants
*NL*
could
hardly
see
each
other
from
one
end
of
the
street
to
the
other
,
*NL*
short
as
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
obscurity
,
which
had
probably
been
desired
and
calculated
on
by
the
*NL*
commanders
who
were
to
direct
the
assault
on
the
barricade
,
was
useful
*NL*
to
Gavroche
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
the
folds
of
this
veil
of
smoke
,
and
thanks
to
his
small
size
,
*NL*
he
could
advance
tolerably
far
into
the
street
without
being
seen
.
He
*NL*
rifled
the
first
seven
or
eight
cartridge-boxes
without
much
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crawled
flat
on
his
belly
,
galloped
on
all
fours
,
took
his
basket
*NL*
in
his
teeth
,
twisted
,
glided
,
undulated
,
wound
from
one
dead
body
to
*NL*
another
,
and
emptied
the
cartridge-box
or
cartouche
as
a
monkey
opens
a
*NL*
nut
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
dare
to
shout
to
him
to
return
from
the
barricade
,
which
*NL*
was
quite
near
,
for
fear
of
attracting
attention
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
one
body
,
that
of
a
corporal
,
he
found
a
powder-flask
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
thirst
,
''
said
he
,
putting
it
in
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
advancing
,
he
reached
a
point
where
the
fog
of
the
fusillade
*NL*
became
transparent
.
So
that
the
sharpshooters
of
the
line
ranged
on
*NL*
the
outlook
behind
their
paving-stone
dike
and
the
sharpshooters
of
the
*NL*
banlieue
massed
at
the
corner
of
the
street
suddenly
pointed
out
to
each
*NL*
other
something
moving
through
the
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
Gavroche
was
relieving
a
sergeant
,
who
was
lying
near
*NL*
a
stone
door-post
,
of
his
cartridges
,
a
bullet
struck
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fichtre
!
''
ejaculated
Gavroche
.
``
They
are
killing
my
dead
men
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
second
bullet
struck
a
spark
from
the
pavement
beside
him
.
--
A
third
*NL*
overturned
his
basket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gavroche
looked
and
saw
that
this
came
from
the
men
of
the
banlieue
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sprang
to
his
feet
,
stood
erect
,
with
his
hair
flying
in
the
wind
,
*NL*
his
hands
on
his
hips
,
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
National
Guardsmen
who
were
*NL*
firing
,
and
sang
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
est
laid
a
Nanterre
,
``
Men
are
ugly
at
Nanterre
,
*NL*
C'est
la

;
'T
is
the
fault
of
Voltaire
;
*NL*
Et

And
dull

Palaiseau
,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
Rousseau
.
''
'T
is
the
fault
of
Rousseau
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
picked
up
his
basket
,
replaced
the
cartridges
which
had
fallen
*NL*
from
it
,
without
missing
a
single
one
,
and
,
advancing
towards
the
*NL*
fusillade
,
set
about
plundering
another
cartridge-box
.
There
a
fourth
*NL*
bullet
missed
him
,
again
.
Gavroche
sang
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
ne
suis
pas
notaire
,
``
I
am
not
a
notary
,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
Voltaire
;
'T
is
the
fault
of
Voltaire
;
*NL*
Je
suis
un
petit
oiseau
,
I
'm
a
little
bird
,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
Rousseau
.
''
'T
is
the
fault
of
Rousseau
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fifth
bullet
only
succeeded
in
drawing
from
him
a
third
couplet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joie
est
mon
caractere
,
``
Joy
is
my
character
,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
Voltaire
;
'T
is
the
fault
of

;
*NL*
Misere

,
Misery
is
my

,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
Rousseau
.
''
'T
is
the
fault
of
Rousseau
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
went
on
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
charming
and
terrible
sight
.
Gavroche
,
though
shot
at
,
was
*NL*
teasing
the
fusillade
.
He
had
the
air
of
being
greatly
diverted
.
It
was
*NL*
the
sparrow
pecking
at
the
sportsmen
.
To
each
discharge
he
retorted
*NL*
with
a
couplet
.
They
aimed
at
him
constantly
,
and
always
missed
him
.
The
*NL*
National
Guardsmen
and
the
soldiers
laughed
as
they
took
aim
at
him
.
He
*NL*
lay
down
,
sprang
to
his
feet
,
hid
in
the
corner
of
a
doorway
,
then
made
*NL*
a
bound
,
disappeared
,
re-appeared
,
scampered
away
,
returned
,
replied
to
*NL*
the
grape-shot
with
his
thumb
at
his
nose
,
and
,
all
the
while
,
went
on
*NL*
pillaging
the
cartouches
,
emptying
the
cartridge-boxes
,
and
filling
his
*NL*
basket
.
The
insurgents
,
panting
with
anxiety
,
followed
him
with
their
*NL*
eyes
.
The
barricade
trembled
;
he
sang
.
He
was
not
a
child
,
he
was
not
*NL*
a
man
;
he
was
a
strange
gamin-fairy
.
He
might
have
been
called
the
*NL*
invulnerable
dwarf
of
the
fray
.
The
bullets
flew
after
him
,
he
was
more
*NL*
nimble
than
they
.
He
played
a
fearful
game
of
hide
and
seek
with
death
;
*NL*
every
time
that
the
flat-nosed
face
of
the
spectre
approached
,
the
*NL*
urchin
administered
to
it
a
fillip
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
bullet
,
however
,
better
aimed
or
more
treacherous
than
the
rest
,
*NL*
finally
struck
the
will-o
'
-
the-wisp
of
a
child
.
Gavroche
was
seen
to
*NL*
stagger
,
then
he
sank
to
the
earth
.
The
whole
barricade
gave
vent
to
a
*NL*
cry
;
but
there
was
something
of
Antaeus
in
that
pygmy
;
for
the
gamin
*NL*
to
touch
the
pavement
is
the
same
as
for
the
giant
to
touch
the
earth
;
*NL*
Gavroche
had
fallen
only
to
rise
again
;
he
remained
in
a
sitting
*NL*
posture
,
a
long
thread
of
blood
streaked
his
face
,
he
raised
both
arms
*NL*
in
the
air
,
glanced
in
the
direction
whence
the
shot
had
come
,
and
began
*NL*
to
sing
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Je
suis
tombe
par
terre
,
``
I
have
fallen
to
the
earth
,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
Voltaire
;
'T
is
the
fault
of
Voltaire
;
*NL*
Le
nez
dans
le
ruisseau
,
With
my
nose
in
the
gutter
,
*NL*
C'est
la
faute
a
...
''
'T
is
the
fault
of
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
.
A
second
bullet
from
the
same
marksman
stopped
him
*NL*
short
.
This
time
he
fell
face
downward
on
the
pavement
,
and
moved
no
*NL*
more
.
This
grand
little
soul
had
taken
its
flight
.

CHAPTER
XVI
--
HOW
FROM
A
BROTHER
ONE
BECOMES
A
FATHER
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
same
moment
,
in
the
garden
of
the
Luxembourg
,
--
for
the
gaze
of
*NL*
the
drama
must
be
everywhere
present
,
--
two
children
were
holding
each
*NL*
other
by
the
hand
.
One
might
have
been
seven
years
old
,
the
other
five
.
*NL*
The
rain
having
soaked
them
,
they
were
walking
along
the
paths
on
*NL*
the
sunny
side
;
the
elder
was
leading
the
younger
;
they
were
pale
and
*NL*
ragged
;
they
had
the
air
of
wild
birds
.
The
smaller
of
them
said
:
``
I
am
*NL*
very
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
elder
,
who
was
already
somewhat
of
a
protector
,
was
leading
his
*NL*
brother
with
his
left
hand
and
in
his
right
he
carried
a
small
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
alone
in
the
garden
.
The
garden
was
deserted
,
the
gates
had
*NL*
been
closed
by
order
of
the
police
,
on
account
of
the
insurrection
.
The
*NL*
troops
who
had
been
bivouacking
there
had
departed
for
the
exigencies
of
*NL*
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
did
those
children
come
there
?
Perhaps
they
had
escaped
from
some
*NL*
guard-house
which
stood
ajar
;
perhaps
there
was
in
the
vicinity
,
at
*NL*
the
Barriere
d'Enfer
;
or
on
the
Esplanade
de
l'Observatoire
,
or
in
the
*NL*
neighboring
carrefour
,
dominated
by
the
pediment
on
which
could
be
read
:
*NL*
Invenerunt
parvulum
pannis
involutum
,
some
mountebank
's
booth
from
which
*NL*
they
had
fled
;
perhaps
they
had
,
on
the
preceding
evening
,
escaped
the
*NL*
eye
of
the
inspectors
of
the
garden
at
the
hour
of
closing
,
and
had
*NL*
passed
the
night
in
some
one
of
those
sentry-boxes
where
people
read
the
*NL*
papers
?
The
fact
is
,
they
were
stray
lambs
and
they
seemed
free
.
To
be
*NL*
astray
and
to
seem
free
is
to
be
lost
.
These
poor
little
creatures
were
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
children
were
the
same
over
whom
Gavroche
had
been
put
to
*NL*
some
trouble
,
as
the
reader
will
recollect
.
Children
of
the
Thenardiers
,
*NL*
leased
out
to
Magnon
,
attributed
to
M.
Gillenormand
,
and
now
leaves
*NL*
fallen
from
all
these
rootless
branches
,
and
swept
over
the
ground
by
*NL*
the
wind
.
Their
clothing
,
which
had
been
clean
in
Magnon
's
day
,
and
*NL*
which
had
served
her
as
a
prospectus
with
M.
Gillenormand
,
had
been
*NL*
converted
into
rags
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
these
beings
belonged
to
the
statistics
as
``
Abandoned
*NL*
children
,
''
whom
the
police
take
note
of
,
collect
,
mislay
and
find
again
*NL*
on
the
pavements
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
required
the
disturbance
of
a
day
like
that
to
account
for
these
*NL*
miserable
little
creatures
being
in
that
garden
.
If
the
superintendents
*NL*
had
caught
sight
of
them
,
they
would
have
driven
such
rags
forth
.
Poor
*NL*
little
things
do
not
enter
public
gardens
;
still
,
people
should
reflect
*NL*
that
,
as
children
,
they
have
a
right
to
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
children
were
there
,
thanks
to
the
locked
gates
.
They
were
there
*NL*
contrary
to
the
regulations
.
They
had
slipped
into
the
garden
and
there
*NL*
they
remained
.
Closed
gates
do
not
dismiss
the
inspectors
,
oversight
*NL*
is
supposed
to
continue
,
but
it
grows
slack
and
reposes
;
and
the
*NL*
inspectors
,
moved
by
the
public
anxiety
and
more
occupied
with
the
*NL*
outside
than
the
inside
,
no
longer
glanced
into
the
garden
,
and
had
not
*NL*
seen
the
two
delinquents
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
rained
the
night
before
,
and
even
a
little
in
the
morning
.
But
*NL*
in
June
,
showers
do
not
count
for
much
.
An
hour
after
a
storm
,
it
can
*NL*
hardly
be
seen
that
the
beautiful
blonde
day
has
wept
.
The
earth
,
in
*NL*
summer
,
is
as
quickly
dried
as
the
cheek
of
a
child
.
At
that
period
of
*NL*
the
solstice
,
the
light
of
full
noonday
is
,
so
to
speak
,
poignant
.
It
*NL*
takes
everything
.
It
applies
itself
to
the
earth
,
and
superposes
itself
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
suction
.
One
would
say
that
the
sun
was
thirsty
.
A
shower
*NL*
is
but
a
glass
of
water
;
a
rainstorm
is
instantly
drunk
up
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
everything
was
dripping
,
in
the
afternoon
everything
is
powdered
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
is
so
worthy
of
admiration
as
foliage
washed
by
the
rain
and
*NL*
wiped
by
the
rays
of
sunlight
;
it
is
warm
freshness
.
The
gardens
and
*NL*
meadows
,
having
water
at
their
roots
,
and
sun
in
their
flowers
,
become
*NL*
perfuming-pans
of
incense
,
and
smoke
with
all
their
odors
at
*NL*
once
.
Everything
smiles
,
sings
and
offers
itself
.
One
feels
gently
*NL*
intoxicated
.
The
springtime
is
a
provisional
paradise
,
the
sun
helps
man
*NL*
to
have
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
beings
who
demand
nothing
further
;
mortals
,
who
,
having
*NL*
the
azure
of
heaven
,
say
:
``
It
is
enough
!
''
dreamers
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
wonderful
,
dipping
into
the
idolatry
of
nature
,
indifferent
to
good
and
*NL*
evil
,
contemplators
of
cosmos
and
radiantly
forgetful
of
man
,
who
do
not
*NL*
understand
how
people
can
occupy
themselves
with
the
hunger
of
these
,
*NL*
and
the
thirst
of
those
,
with
the
nudity
of
the
poor
in
winter
,
with
the
*NL*
lymphatic
curvature
of
the
little
spinal
column
,
with
the
pallet
,
the
*NL*
attic
,
the
dungeon
,
and
the
rags
of
shivering
young
girls
,
when
they
*NL*
can
dream
beneath
the
trees
;
peaceful
and
terrible
spirits
they
,
and
*NL*
pitilessly
satisfied
.
Strange
to
say
,
the
infinite
suffices
them
.
That
*NL*
great
need
of
man
,
the
finite
,
which
admits
of
embrace
,
they
ignore
.
*NL*
The
finite
which
admits
of
progress
and
sublime
toil
,
they
do
not
*NL*
think
about
.
The
indefinite
,
which
is
born
from
the
human
and
divine
*NL*
combination
of
the
infinite
and
the
finite
,
escapes
them
.
Provided
that
*NL*
they
are
face
to
face
with
immensity
,
they
smile
.
Joy
never
,
ecstasy
*NL*
forever
.
Their
life
lies
in
surrendering
their
personality
in
*NL*
contemplation
.
The
history
of
humanity
is
for
them
only
a
detailed
*NL*
plan
.
All
is
not
there
;
the
true
All
remains
without
;
what
is
the
use
*NL*
of
busying
oneself
over
that
detail
,
man
?
Man
suffers
,
that
is
quite
*NL*
possible
;
but
look
at
Aldebaran
rising
!
The
mother
has
no
more
milk
,
the
*NL*
new-born
babe
is
dying
.
I
know
nothing
about
that
,
but
just
look
at
this
*NL*
wonderful
rosette
which
a
slice
of
wood-cells
of
the
pine
presents
under
*NL*
the
microscope
!
Compare
the
most
beautiful
Mechlin
lace
to
that
if
you
*NL*
can
!
These
thinkers
forget
to
love
.
The
zodiac
thrives
with
them
to
such
*NL*
a
point
that
it
prevents
their
seeing
the
weeping
child
.
God
eclipses
*NL*
their
souls
.
This
is
a
family
of
minds
which
are
,
at
once
,
great
and
*NL*
petty
.
Horace
was
one
of
them
;
so
was
Goethe
.
La
Fontaine
perhaps
;
*NL*
magnificent
egoists
of
the
infinite
,
tranquil
spectators
of
sorrow
,
who
*NL*
do
not
behold
Nero
if
the
weather
be
fair
,
for
whom
the
sun
conceals
the
*NL*
funeral
pile
,
who
would
look
on
at
an
execution
by
the
guillotine
in
the
*NL*
search
for
an
effect
of
light
,
who
hear
neither
the
cry
nor
the
sob
,
nor
*NL*
the
death
rattle
,
nor
the
alarm
peal
,
for
whom
everything
is
well
,
since
*NL*
there
is
a
month
of
May
,
who
,
so
long
as
there
are
clouds
of
purple
*NL*
and
gold
above
their
heads
,
declare
themselves
content
,
and
who
are
*NL*
determined
to
be
happy
until
the
radiance
of
the
stars
and
the
songs
of
*NL*
the
birds
are
exhausted
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
are
dark
radiances
.
They
have
no
suspicion
that
they
are
to
be
*NL*
pitied
.
Certainly
they
are
so
.
He
who
does
not
weep
does
not
see
.
They
*NL*
are
to
be
admired
and
pitied
,
as
one
would
both
pity
and
admire
a
being
*NL*
at
once
night
and
day
,
without
eyes
beneath
his
lashes
but
with
a
star
*NL*
on
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
indifference
of
these
thinkers
,
is
,
according
to
some
,
a
superior
*NL*
philosophy
.
That
may
be
;
but
in
this
superiority
there
is
some
*NL*
infirmity
.
One
may
be
immortal
and
yet
limp
:
witness
Vulcan
.
One
may
*NL*
be
more
than
man
and
less
than
man
.
There
is
incomplete
immensity
in
*NL*
nature
.
Who
knows
whether
the
sun
is
not
a
blind
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
,
what
?
In
whom
can
we
trust
?
Solem
quis
dicere
falsum
audeat
?
*NL*
Who
shall
dare
to
say
that
the
sun
is
false
?
Thus
certain
geniuses
,
*NL*
themselves
,
certain
Very-Lofty
mortals
,
man-stars
,
may
be
mistaken
?
That
*NL*
which
is
on
high
at
the
summit
,
at
the
crest
,
at
the
zenith
,
that
which
*NL*
sends
down
so
much
light
on
the
earth
,
sees
but
little
,
sees
badly
,
sees
*NL*
not
at
all
?
Is
not
this
a
desperate
state
of
things
?
No
.
But
what
is
*NL*
there
,
then
,
above
the
sun
?
The
god
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
6th
of
June
,
1832
,
about
eleven
o'clock
in
the
morning
,
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
,
solitary
and
depopulated
,
was
charming
.
The
quincunxes
and
*NL*
flower-beds
shed
forth
balm
and
dazzling
beauty
into
the
sunlight
.
The
*NL*
branches
,
wild
with
the
brilliant
glow
of
midday
,
seemed
endeavoring
*NL*
to
embrace
.
In
the
sycamores
there
was
an
uproar
of
linnets
,
sparrows
*NL*
triumphed
,
woodpeckers
climbed
along
the
chestnut
trees
,
administering
*NL*
little
pecks
on
the
bark
.
The
flower-beds
accepted
the
legitimate
*NL*
royalty
of
the
lilies
;
the
most
august
of
perfumes
is
that
which
*NL*
emanates
from
whiteness
.
The
peppery
odor
of
the
carnations
was
*NL*
perceptible
.
The
old
crows
of
Marie
de
Medici
were
amorous
in
the
tall
*NL*
trees
.
The
sun
gilded
,
empurpled
,
set
fire
to
and
lighted
up
the
tulips
,
*NL*
which
are
nothing
but
all
the
varieties
of
flame
made
into
flowers
.
All
*NL*
around
the
banks
of
tulips
the
bees
,
the
sparks
of
these
flame-flowers
,
*NL*
hummed
.
All
was
grace
and
gayety
,
even
the
impending
rain
;
this
relapse
,
*NL*
by
which
the
lilies
of
the
valley
and
the
honeysuckles
were
destined
to
*NL*
profit
,
had
nothing
disturbing
about
it
;
the
swallows
indulged
in
the
*NL*
charming
threat
of
flying
low
.
He
who
was
there
aspired
to
happiness
;
*NL*
life
smelled
good
;
all
nature
exhaled
candor
,
help
,
assistance
,
*NL*
paternity
,
caress
,
dawn
.
The
thoughts
which
fell
from
heaven
were
as
*NL*
sweet
as
the
tiny
hand
of
a
baby
when
one
kisses
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
statues
under
the
trees
,
white
and
nude
,
had
robes
of
shadow
pierced
*NL*
with
light
;
these
goddesses
were
all
tattered
with
sunlight
;
rays
hung
*NL*
from
them
on
all
sides
.
Around
the
great
fountain
,
the
earth
was
already
*NL*
dried
up
to
the
point
of
being
burnt
.
There
was
sufficient
breeze
to
*NL*
raise
little
insurrections
of
dust
here
and
there
.
A
few
yellow
leaves
,
*NL*
left
over
from
the
autumn
,
chased
each
other
merrily
,
and
seemed
to
be
*NL*
playing
tricks
on
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
abundance
of
light
had
something
indescribably
reassuring
about
it
.
*NL*
Life
,
sap
,
heat
,
odors
overflowed
;
one
was
conscious
,
beneath
creation
,
*NL*
of
the
enormous
size
of
the
source
;
in
all
these
breaths
permeated
with
*NL*
love
,
in
this
interchange
of
reverberations
and
reflections
,
in
this
*NL*
marvellous
expenditure
of
rays
,
in
this
infinite
outpouring
of
liquid
*NL*
gold
,
one
felt
the
prodigality
of
the
inexhaustible
;
and
,
behind
this
*NL*
splendor
as
behind
a
curtain
of
flame
,
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
God
,
that
*NL*
millionaire
of
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
sand
,
there
was
not
a
speck
of
mud
;
thanks
to
the
rain
,
*NL*
there
was
not
a
grain
of
ashes
.
The
clumps
of
blossoms
had
just
been
*NL*
bathed
;
every
sort
of
velvet
,
satin
,
gold
and
varnish
,
which
springs
*NL*
from
the
earth
in
the
form
of
flowers
,
was
irreproachable
.
This
*NL*
magnificence
was
cleanly
.
The
grand
silence
of
happy
nature
filled
the
*NL*
garden
.
A
celestial
silence
that
is
compatible
with
a
thousand
sorts
of
*NL*
music
,
the
cooing
of
nests
,
the
buzzing
of
swarms
,
the
flutterings
of
*NL*
the
breeze
.
All
the
harmony
of
the
season
was
complete
in
one
gracious
*NL*
whole
;
the
entrances
and
exits
of
spring
took
place
in
proper
order
;
the
*NL*
lilacs
ended
;
the
jasmines
began
;
some
flowers
were
tardy
,
some
insects
*NL*
in
advance
of
their
time
;
the
van-guard
of
the
red
June
butterflies
*NL*
fraternized
with
the
rear-guard
of
the
white
butterflies
of
May
.
The
*NL*
plantain
trees
were
getting
their
new
skins
.
The
breeze
hollowed
out
*NL*
undulations
in
the
magnificent
enormity
of
the
chestnut-trees
.
It
*NL*
was
splendid
.
A
veteran
from
the
neighboring
barracks
,
who
was
gazing
*NL*
through
the
fence
,
said
:
``
Here
is
the
Spring
presenting
arms
and
in
full
*NL*
uniform
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
nature
was
breakfasting
;
creation
was
at
table
;
this
was
its
hour
;
*NL*
the
great
blue
cloth
was
spread
in
the
sky
,
and
the
great
green
cloth
*NL*
on
earth
;
the
sun
lighted
it
all
up
brilliantly
.
God
was
serving
*NL*
the
universal
repast
.
Each
creature
had
his
pasture
or
his
mess
.
The
*NL*
ring-dove
found
his
hemp-seed
,
the
chaffinch
found
his
millet
,
the
*NL*
goldfinch
found
chickweed
,
the
red-breast
found
worms
,
the
green
finch
*NL*
found
flies
,
the
fly
found
infusoriae
,
the
bee
found
flowers
.
They
ate
*NL*
each
other
somewhat
,
it
is
true
,
which
is
the
misery
of
evil
mixed
with
*NL*
good
;
but
not
a
beast
of
them
all
had
an
empty
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
little
abandoned
creatures
had
arrived
in
the
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
grand
fountain
,
and
,
rather
bewildered
by
all
this
light
,
they
tried
to
*NL*
hide
themselves
,
the
instinct
of
the
poor
and
the
weak
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
even
impersonal
magnificence
;
and
they
kept
behind
the
swans
'
hutch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
and
there
,
at
intervals
,
when
the
wind
blew
,
shouts
,
clamor
,
a
sort
*NL*
of
tumultuous
death
rattle
,
which
was
the
firing
,
and
dull
blows
,
which
*NL*
were
discharges
of
cannon
,
struck
the
ear
confusedly
.
Smoke
hung
over
*NL*
the
roofs
in
the
direction
of
the
Halles
.
A
bell
,
which
had
the
air
of
*NL*
an
appeal
,
was
ringing
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
children
did
not
appear
to
notice
these
noises
.
The
little
one
*NL*
repeated
from
time
to
time
:
``
I
am
hungry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
same
instant
with
the
children
,
another
couple
approached
*NL*
the
great
basin
.
They
consisted
of
a
goodman
,
about
fifty
years
of
age
,
*NL*
who
was
leading
by
the
hand
a
little
fellow
of
six
.
No
doubt
,
a
father
*NL*
and
his
son
.
The
little
man
of
six
had
a
big
brioche
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
certain
houses
abutting
on
the
river
,
in
the
Rues
Madame
*NL*
and
d'Enfer
,
had
keys
to
the
Luxembourg
garden
,
of
which
the
lodgers
*NL*
enjoyed
the
use
when
the
gates
were
shut
,
a
privilege
which
was
*NL*
suppressed
later
on
.
This
father
and
son
came
from
one
of
these
houses
,
*NL*
no
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
poor
little
creatures
watched
``
that
gentleman
''
approaching
,
and
*NL*
hid
themselves
a
little
more
thoroughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
bourgeois
.
The
same
person
,
perhaps
,
whom
Marius
had
one
day
*NL*
heard
,
through
his
love
fever
,
near
the
same
grand
basin
,
counselling
*NL*
his
son
``
to
avoid
excesses
.
''
He
had
an
affable
and
haughty
air
,
and
a
*NL*
mouth
which
was
always
smiling
,
since
it
did
not
shut
.
This
mechanical
*NL*
smile
,
produced
by
too
much
jaw
and
too
little
skin
,
shows
the
teeth
*NL*
rather
than
the
soul
.
The
child
,
with
his
brioche
,
which
he
had
bitten
*NL*
into
but
had
not
finished
eating
,
seemed
satiated
.
The
child
was
dressed
*NL*
as
a
National
Guardsman
,
owing
to
the
insurrection
,
and
the
father
had
*NL*
remained
clad
as
a
bourgeois
out
of
prudence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
and
son
halted
near
the
fountain
where
two
swans
were
sporting
.
*NL*
This
bourgeois
appeared
to
cherish
a
special
admiration
for
the
swans
.
*NL*
He
resembled
them
in
this
sense
,
that
he
walked
like
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
moment
,
the
swans
were
swimming
,
which
is
their
principal
*NL*
talent
,
and
they
were
superb
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
two
poor
little
beings
had
listened
and
if
they
had
been
of
an
*NL*
age
to
understand
,
they
might
have
gathered
the
words
of
this
grave
man
.
*NL*
The
father
was
saying
to
his
son
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sage
lives
content
with
little
.
Look
at
me
,
my
son
.
I
do
not
love
*NL*
pomp
.
I
am
never
seen
in
clothes
decked
with
gold
lace
and
stones
;
I
*NL*
leave
that
false
splendor
to
badly
organized
souls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
deep
shouts
which
proceeded
from
the
direction
of
the
Halles
*NL*
burst
out
with
fresh
force
of
bell
and
uproar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
?
''
inquired
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
Saturnalia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
caught
sight
of
the
two
little
ragged
boys
behind
the
*NL*
green
swan-hutch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
the
beginning
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
after
a
pause
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anarchy
is
entering
this
garden
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
his
son
took
a
bite
of
his
brioche
,
spit
it
out
,
and
,
*NL*
suddenly
burst
out
crying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
crying
about
?
''
demanded
his
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
hungry
any
more
,
''
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
's
smile
became
more
accentuated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
does
not
need
to
be
hungry
in
order
to
eat
a
cake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
cake
tires
me
.
It
is
stale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
want
any
more
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
pointed
to
the
swans
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Throw
it
to
those
palmipeds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
child
hesitated
.
A
person
may
not
want
any
more
of
his
cake
;
but
*NL*
that
is
no
reason
for
giving
it
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
humane
.
You
must
have
compassion
on
animals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
taking
the
cake
from
his
son
,
he
flung
it
into
the
basin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cake
fell
very
near
the
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
swans
were
far
away
,
in
the
centre
of
the
basin
,
and
busy
with
some
*NL*
prey
.
They
had
seen
neither
the
bourgeois
nor
the
brioche
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bourgeois
,
feeling
that
the
cake
was
in
danger
of
being
wasted
,
and
*NL*
moved
by
this
useless
shipwreck
,
entered
upon
a
telegraphic
agitation
,
*NL*
which
finally
attracted
the
attention
of
the
swans
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
perceived
something
floating
,
steered
for
the
edge
like
ships
,
as
*NL*
they
are
,
and
slowly
directed
their
course
toward
the
brioche
,
with
the
*NL*
stupid
majesty
which
befits
white
creatures
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
swans
-LSB-
cygnes
-RSB-
understand
signs
-LSB-
signes
-RSB-
,
''
said
the
bourgeois
,
*NL*
delighted
to
make
a
jest
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
the
distant
tumult
of
the
city
underwent
another
sudden
*NL*
increase
.
This
time
it
was
sinister
.
There
are
some
gusts
of
wind
which
*NL*
speak
more
distinctly
than
others
.
The
one
which
was
blowing
at
that
*NL*
moment
brought
clearly
defined
drum-beats
,
clamors
,
platoon
firing
,
and
*NL*
the
dismal
replies
of
the
tocsin
and
the
cannon
.
This
coincided
with
a
*NL*
black
cloud
which
suddenly
veiled
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
swans
had
not
yet
reached
the
brioche
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
return
home
,
''
said
the
father
,
``
they
are
attacking
the
*NL*
Tuileries
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
grasped
his
son
's
hand
again
.
Then
he
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
the
Tuileries
to
the
Luxembourg
,
there
is
but
the
distance
which
*NL*
separates
Royalty
from
the
peerage
;
that
is
not
far
.
Shots
will
soon
*NL*
rain
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
the
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
is
rain
itself
that
is
about
to
shower
down
;
the
sky
*NL*
is
joining
in
;
the
younger
branch
is
condemned
.
Let
us
return
home
*NL*
quickly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
the
swans
eat
the
brioche
,
''
said
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
imprudent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
led
his
little
bourgeois
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
son
,
regretting
the
swans
,
turned
his
head
back
toward
the
basin
*NL*
until
a
corner
of
the
quincunxes
concealed
it
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
two
little
waifs
had
approached
the
brioche
at
*NL*
the
same
time
as
the
swans
.
It
was
floating
on
the
water
.
The
smaller
of
*NL*
them
stared
at
the
cake
,
the
elder
gazed
after
the
retreating
bourgeois
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
and
son
entered
the
labyrinth
of
walks
which
leads
to
the
grand
*NL*
flight
of
steps
near
the
clump
of
trees
on
the
side
of
the
Rue
Madame
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
they
had
disappeared
from
view
,
the
elder
child
hastily
*NL*
flung
himself
flat
on
his
stomach
on
the
rounding
curb
of
the
basin
,
and
*NL*
clinging
to
it
with
his
left
hand
,
and
leaning
over
the
water
,
on
the
*NL*
verge
of
falling
in
,
he
stretched
out
his
right
hand
with
his
stick
*NL*
towards
the
cake
.
The
swans
,
perceiving
the
enemy
,
made
haste
,
and
in
so
*NL*
doing
,
they
produced
an
effect
of
their
breasts
which
was
of
service
to
*NL*
the
little
fisher
;
the
water
flowed
back
before
the
swans
,
and
one
of
*NL*
these
gentle
concentric
undulations
softly
floated
the
brioche
towards
*NL*
the
child
's
wand
.
Just
as
the
swans
came
up
,
the
stick
touched
the
cake
.
*NL*
The
child
gave
it
a
brisk
rap
,
drew
in
the
brioche
,
frightened
away
the
*NL*
swans
,
seized
the
cake
,
and
sprang
to
his
feet
.
The
cake
was
wet
;
*NL*
but
they
were
hungry
and
thirsty
.
The
elder
broke
the
cake
into
two
*NL*
portions
,
a
large
one
and
a
small
one
,
took
the
small
one
for
himself
,
*NL*
gave
the
large
one
to
his
brother
,
and
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ram
that
into
your
muzzle

which
the
father
had
done
for
his
father

he
*NL*
was
requiting
to
the
son
;
only
,
Thenardier
had
brought
back
his
father
*NL*
alive
;
he
was
bringing
back
the
child
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Marius
re-entered
the
redoubt
with
Gavroche
in
his
arms
,
his
face
,
*NL*
like
the
child
,
was
inundated
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
he
had
stooped
to
lift
Gavroche
,
a
bullet
had
grazed
*NL*
his
head
;
he
had
not
noticed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
untied
his
cravat
and
with
it
bandaged
Marius
'
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
laid
Gavroche
on
the
same
table
with
Mabeuf
,
and
spread
over
the
*NL*
two
corpses
the
black
shawl
.
There
was
enough
of
it
for
both
the
old
man
*NL*
and
the
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
Combeferre
distributed
the
cartridges
from
the
basket
which
he
had
*NL*
brought
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
gave
each
man
fifteen
rounds
to
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
still
in
the
same
place
,
motionless
on
his
stone
post
.
*NL*
When
Combeferre
offered
him
his
fifteen
cartridges
,
he
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
rare
eccentric
,
''
said
Combeferre
in
a
low
voice
to
Enjolras
.
*NL*
``
He
finds
a
way
of
not
fighting
in
this
barricade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
does
not
prevent
him
from
defending
it
,
''
responded
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heroism
has
its
originals
,
''
resumed
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Courfeyrac
,
who
had
overheard
,
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
another
sort
from
Father
Mabeuf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
which
must
be
noted
is
,
that
the
fire
which
was
battering
the
*NL*
barricade
hardly
disturbed
the
interior
.
Those
who
have
never
traversed
*NL*
the
whirlwind
of
this
sort
of
war
can
form
no
idea
of
the
singular
*NL*
moments
of
tranquillity
mingled
with
these
convulsions
.
Men
go
and
*NL*
come
,
they
talk
,
they
jest
,
they
lounge
.
Some
one
whom
we
know
heard
a
*NL*
combatant
say
to
him
in
the
midst
of
the
grape-shot
:
``
We
are
here
as
*NL*
at
a
bachelor
breakfast
.
''
The
redoubt
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
we
*NL*
repeat
,
seemed
very
calm
within
.
All
mutations
and
all
phases
had
been
,
*NL*
or
were
about
to
be
,
exhausted
.
The
position
,
from
critical
,
had
become
*NL*
menacing
,
and
,
from
menacing
,
was
probably
about
to
become
desperate
.
In
*NL*
proportion
as
the
situation
grew
gloomy
,
the
glow
of
heroism
empurpled
*NL*
the
barricade
more
and
more
.
Enjolras
,
who
was
grave
,
dominated
it
,
*NL*
in
the
attitude
of
a
young
Spartan
sacrificing
his
naked
sword
to
the
*NL*
sombre
genius
,
Epidotas
.
*NL*
*NL*
Combeferre
,
wearing
an
apron
,
was
dressing
the
wounds
:
Bossuet
and
*NL*
Feuilly
were
making
cartridges
with
the
powder-flask
picked
up
by
*NL*
Gavroche
on
the
dead
corporal
,
and
Bossuet
said
to
Feuilly
:
``
We
are
soon
*NL*
to
take
the
diligence
for
another
planet
''
;
Courfeyrac
was
disposing
and
*NL*
arranging
on
some
paving-stones
which
he
had
reserved
for
himself
near
*NL*
Enjolras
,
a
complete
arsenal
,
his
sword-cane
,
his
gun
,
two
holster
*NL*
pistols
,
and
a
cudgel
,
with
the
care
of
a
young
girl
setting
a
small
*NL*
dunkerque
in
order
.
Jean
Valjean
stared
silently
at
the
wall
opposite
*NL*
him
.
An
artisan
was
fastening
Mother
Hucheloup
's
big
straw
hat
on
his
*NL*
head
with
a
string
,
``
for
fear
of
sun-stroke
,
''
as
he
said
.
The
young
*NL*
men
from
the
Cougourde
d'Aix
were
chatting
merrily
among
themselves
,
*NL*
as
though
eager
to
speak
patois
for
the
last
time
.
Joly
,
who
had
taken
*NL*
Widow
Hucheloup
's
mirror
from
the
wall
,
was
examining
his
tongue
in
it
.
*NL*
Some
combatants
,
having
discovered
a
few
crusts
of
rather
mouldy
bread
,
*NL*
in
a
drawer
,
were
eagerly
devouring
them
.
Marius
was
disturbed
with
*NL*
regard
to
what
his
father
was
about
to
say
to
him
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
--
THE
VULTURE
BECOME
PREY
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
insist
upon
one
psychological
fact
peculiar
to
barricades
.
*NL*
Nothing
which
is
characteristic
of
that
surprising
war
of
the
streets
*NL*
should
be
omitted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
may
have
been
the
singular
inward
tranquillity
which
we
have
*NL*
just
mentioned
,
the
barricade
,
for
those
who
are
inside
it
,
remains
,
*NL*
none
the
less
,
a
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
of
the
apocalypse
in
civil
war
,
all
the
mists
of
the
*NL*
unknown
are
commingled
with
fierce
flashes
,
revolutions
are
sphinxes
,
*NL*
and
any
one
who
has
passed
through
a
barricade
thinks
he
has
traversed
a
*NL*
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
feelings
to
which
one
is
subject
in
these
places
we
have
pointed
out
*NL*
in
the
case
of
Marius
,
and
we
shall
see
the
consequences
;
they
are
both
*NL*
more
and
less
than
life
.
On
emerging
from
a
barricade
,
one
no
longer
*NL*
knows
what
one
has
seen
there
.
One
has
been
terrible
,
but
one
knows
*NL*
it
not
.
One
has
been
surrounded
with
conflicting
ideas
which
had
human
*NL*
faces
;
one
's
head
has
been
in
the
light
of
the
future
.
There
were
*NL*
corpses
lying
prone
there
,
and
phantoms
standing
erect
.
The
hours
were
*NL*
colossal
and
seemed
hours
of
eternity
.
One
has
lived
in
death
.
Shadows
*NL*
have
passed
by
.
What
were
they
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
has
beheld
hands
on
which
there
was
blood
;
there
was
a
deafening
*NL*
horror
;
there
was
also
a
frightful
silence
;
there
were
open
mouths
which
*NL*
shouted
,
and
other
open
mouths
which
held
their
peace
;
one
was
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
smoke
,
of
night
,
perhaps
.
One
fancied
that
one
had
touched
the
*NL*
sinister
ooze
of
unknown
depths
;
one
stares
at
something
red
on
one
's
*NL*
finger
nails
.
One
no
longer
remembers
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
return
to
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
between
two
discharges
,
the
distant
sound
of
a
clock
*NL*
striking
the
hour
became
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
midday
,
''
said
Combeferre
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
twelve
strokes
had
not
finished
striking
when
Enjolras
sprang
to
his
*NL*
feet
,
and
from
the
summit
of
the
barricade
hurled
this
thundering
shout
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carry
stones
up
into
the
houses
;
line
the
windowsills
and
the
*NL*
roofs
with
them
.
Half
the
men
to
their
guns
,
the
other
half
to
the
*NL*
paving-stones
.
There
is
not
a
minute
to
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
squad
of
sappers
and
miners
,
axe
on
shoulder
,
had
just
made
their
*NL*
appearance
in
battle
array
at
the
end
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
could
only
be
the
head
of
a
column
;
and
of
what
column
?
The
*NL*
attacking
column
,
evidently
;
the
sappers
charged
with
the
demolition
of
*NL*
the
barricade
must
always
precede
the
soldiers
who
are
to
scale
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
,
evidently
,
on
the
brink
of
that
moment
which
M.
*NL*
Clermont-Tonnerre
,
in
1822
,
called
``
the
tug
of
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
'
order
was
executed
with
the
correct
haste
which
is
peculiar
*NL*
to
ships
and
barricades
,
the
only
two
scenes
of
combat
where
escape
*NL*
is
impossible
.
In
less
than
a
minute
,
two
thirds
of
the
stones
which
*NL*
Enjolras
had
had
piled
up
at
the
door
of
Corinthe
had
been
carried
up
to
*NL*
the
first
floor
and
the
attic
,
and
before
a
second
minute
had
elapsed
,
*NL*
these
stones
,
artistically
set
one
upon
the
other
,
walled
up
the
*NL*
sash-window
on
the
first
floor
and
the
windows
in
the
roof
to
half
their
*NL*
height
.
A
few
loop-holes
carefully
planned
by
Feuilly
,
the
principal
*NL*
architect
,
allowed
of
the
passage
of
the
gun-barrels
.
This
armament
of
*NL*
the
windows
could
be
effected
all
the
more
easily
since
the
firing
of
*NL*
grape-shot
had
ceased
.
The
two
cannons
were
now
discharging
ball
*NL*
against
the
centre
of
the
barrier
in
order
to
make
a
hole
there
,
and
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
a
breach
for
the
assault
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
stones
destined
to
the
final
defence
were
in
place
,
Enjolras
*NL*
had
the
bottles
which
he
had
set
under
the
table
where
Mabeuf
lay
,
*NL*
carried
to
the
first
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
to
drink
that
?
''
Bossuet
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
,
''
replied
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
barricaded
the
window
below
,
and
held
in
readiness
the
iron
*NL*
cross-bars
which
served
to
secure
the
door
of
the
wine-shop
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fortress
was
complete
.
The
barricade
was
the
rampart
,
the
wine-shop
*NL*
was
the
dungeon
.
With
the
stones
which
remained
they
stopped
up
the
*NL*
outlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
defenders
of
a
barricade
are
always
obliged
to
be
sparing
of
*NL*
their
ammunition
,
and
as
the
assailants
know
this
,
the
assailants
*NL*
combine
their
arrangements
with
a
sort
of
irritating
leisure
,
expose
*NL*
themselves
to
fire
prematurely
,
though
in
appearance
more
than
in
*NL*
reality
,
and
take
their
ease
.
The
preparations
for
attack
are
always
*NL*
made
with
a
certain
methodical
deliberation
;
after
which
,
the
lightning
*NL*
strikes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
deliberation
permitted
Enjolras
to
take
a
review
of
everything
and
*NL*
to
perfect
everything
.
He
felt
that
,
since
such
men
were
to
die
,
their
*NL*
death
ought
to
be
a
masterpiece
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
Marius
:
``
We
are
the
two
leaders
.
I
will
give
the
last
orders
*NL*
inside
.
Do
you
remain
outside
and
observe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
posted
himself
on
the
lookout
upon
the
crest
of
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
had
the
door
of
the
kitchen
,
which
was
the
ambulance
,
as
the
*NL*
reader
will
remember
,
nailed
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
splashing
of
the
wounded
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
issued
his
final
orders
in
the
tap-room
in
a
curt
,
but
profoundly
*NL*
tranquil
tone
;
Feuilly
listened
and
replied
in
the
name
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
first
floor
,
hold
your
axes
in
readiness
to
cut
the
staircase
.
*NL*
Have
you
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Feuilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
many
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
axes
and
a
pole-axe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
good
.
There
are
now
twenty-six
combatants
of
us
on
foot
.
How
*NL*
many
guns
are
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirty-four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
too
many
.
Keep
those
eight
guns
loaded
like
the
rest
and
at
*NL*
hand
.
Swords
and
pistols
in
your
belts
.
Twenty
men
to
the
barricade
.
Six
*NL*
ambushed
in
the
attic
windows
,
and
at
the
window
on
the
first
floor
to
*NL*
fire
on
the
assailants
through
the
loop-holes
in
the
stones
.
Let
not
a
*NL*
single
worker
remain
inactive
here
.
Presently
,
when
the
drum
beats
the
*NL*
assault
,
let
the
twenty
below
stairs
rush
to
the
barricade
.
The
first
to
*NL*
arrive
will
have
the
best
places
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
arrangements
made
,
he
turned
to
Javert
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
forgetting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
laying
a
pistol
on
the
table
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
last
man
to
leave
this
room
will
smash
the
skull
of
this
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
?
''
inquired
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
let
us
not
mix
their
corpses
with
our
own
.
The
little
barricade
of
*NL*
the
Mondetour
lane
can
be
scaled
.
It
is
only
four
feet
high
.
The
man
is
*NL*
well
pinioned
.
He
shall
be
taken
thither
and
put
to
death
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
some
one
who
was
more
impassive
at
that
moment
than
Enjolras
,
*NL*
it
was
Javert
.
Here
Jean
Valjean
made
his
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
lost
among
the
group
of
insurgents
.
He
stepped
forth
and
*NL*
said
to
Enjolras
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
commander
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thanked
me
a
while
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
name
of
the
Republic
.
The
barricade
has
two
saviors
,
Marius
*NL*
Pontmercy
and
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
that
I
deserve
a
recompense
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
request
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
may
blow
that
man
's
brains
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
raised
his
head
,
saw
Jean
Valjean
,
made
an
almost
imperceptible
*NL*
movement
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Enjolras
,
he
had
begun
to
re-load
his
rifle
;
he
cut
his
eyes
*NL*
about
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
objections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
turned
to
Jean
Valjean
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
spy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
did
,
in
fact
,
take
possession
of
Javert
,
by
seating
*NL*
himself
on
the
end
of
the
table
.
He
seized
the
pistol
,
and
a
faint
click
*NL*
announced
that
he
had
cocked
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
at
the
same
moment
,
a
blast
of
trumpets
became
audible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
!
''
shouted
Marius
from
the
top
of
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
began
to
laugh
with
that
noiseless
laugh
which
was
peculiar
to
*NL*
him
,
and
gazing
intently
at
the
insurgents
,
he
said
to
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
no
better
case
than
I
am
.

CHAPTER

--
JEAN
VALJEAN
TAKES
HIS
REVENGE
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jean
Valjean
was
left
alone
with
Javert
,
he
untied
the
rope
which
*NL*
fastened
the
prisoner
across
the
middle
of
the
body
,
and
the
knot
of
*NL*
which
was
under
the
table
.
After
this
he
made
him
a
sign
to
rise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
obeyed
with
that
indefinable
smile
in
which
the
supremacy
of
*NL*
enchained
authority
is
condensed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
took
Javert
by
the
martingale
,
as
one
would
take
a
beast
of
*NL*
burden
by
the
breast-band
,
and
,
dragging
the
latter
after
him
,
emerged
*NL*
from
the
wine-shop
slowly
,
because
Javert
,
with
his
impeded
limbs
,
could
*NL*
take
only
very
short
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
the
pistol
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
manner
they
crossed
the
inner
trapezium
of
the
barricade
.
The
*NL*
insurgents
,
all
intent
on
the
attack
,
which
was
imminent
,
had
their
*NL*
backs
turned
to
these
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
alone
,
stationed
on
one
side
,
at
the
extreme
left
of
the
*NL*
barricade
,
saw
them
pass
.
This
group
of
victim
and
executioner
was
*NL*
illuminated
by
the
sepulchral
light
which
he
bore
in
his
own
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
with
some
difficulty
,
but
without
relaxing
his
hold
for
*NL*
a
single
instant
,
made
Javert
,
pinioned
as
he
was
,
scale
the
little
*NL*
entrenchment
in
the
Mondetour
lane
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
had
crossed
this
barrier
,
they
found
themselves
alone
in
the
*NL*
lane
.
No
one
saw
them
.
Among
the
heap
they
could
distinguish
a
livid
*NL*
face
,
streaming
hair
,
a
pierced
hand
and
the
half
nude
breast
of
a
*NL*
woman
.
It
was
Eponine
.
The
corner
of
the
houses
hid
them
from
the
*NL*
insurgents
.
The
corpses
carried
away
from
the
barricade
formed
a
*NL*
terrible
pile
a
few
paces
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
gazed
askance
at
this
body
,
and
,
profoundly
calm
,
said
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
strikes
me
that
I
know
that
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
thrust
the
pistol
under
his
arm
and
fixed
on
Javert
a
look
*NL*
which
it
required
no
words
to
interpret
:
``
Javert
,
it
is
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
your
revenge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
drew
from
his
pocket
a
knife
,
and
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
clasp-knife
!
''
exclaimed
Javert
,
``
you
are
right
.
That
suits
you
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
cut
the
martingale
which
Javert
had
about
his
neck
,
then
he
*NL*
cut
the
cords
on
his
wrists
,
then
,
stooping
down
,
he
cut
the
cord
on
his
*NL*
feet
;
and
,
straightening
himself
up
,
he
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
not
easily
astonished
.
Still
,
master
of
himself
though
*NL*
he
was
,
he
could
not
repress
a
start
.
He
remained
open-mouthed
and
*NL*
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
that
I
shall
escape
from
this
place
.
But
if
,
by
chance
,
*NL*
I
do
,
I
live
,
under
the
name
of
Fauchelevent
,
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
*NL*
Arme
,
No.
7
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
snarled
like
a
tiger
,
which
made
him
half
open
one
corner
of
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
he
muttered
between
his
teeth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
began
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
saidst
Fauchelevent
,
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Number
7
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
repeated
in
a
low
voice
:
--
``
Number
7
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
buttoned
up
his
coat
once
more
,
resumed
the
military
stiffness
*NL*
between
his
shoulders
,
made
a
half
turn
,
folded
his
arms
and
,
supporting
*NL*
his
chin
on
one
of
his
hands
,
he
set
out
in
the
direction
of
the
Halles
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
followed
him
with
his
eyes
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
minutes
later
,
Javert
turned
round
and
shouted
to
Jean
Valjean
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
annoy
me
.
Kill
me
,
rather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
himself
did
not
notice
that
he
no
longer
addressed
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
as
``
thou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
off
with
you
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
retreated
slowly
.
A
moment
later
he
turned
the
corner
of
the
Rue
*NL*
des
Precheurs
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Javert
had
disappeared
,
Jean
Valjean
fired
his
pistol
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
returned
to
the
barricade
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
this
is
what
had
taken
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
more
intent
on
the
outside
than
on
the
interior
,
had
not
,
up
to
*NL*
that
time
,
taken
a
good
look
at
the
pinioned
spy
in
the
dark
background
*NL*
of
the
tap-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
beheld
him
in
broad
daylight
,
striding
over
the
barricade
in
*NL*
order
to
proceed
to
his
death
,
he
recognized
him
.
Something
suddenly
*NL*
recurred
to
his
mind
.
He
recalled
the
inspector
of
the
Rue
de
Pontoise
,
*NL*
and
the
two
pistols
which
the
latter
had
handed
to
him
and
which
he
,
*NL*
Marius
,
had
used
in
this
very
barricade
,
and
not
only
did
he
recall
his
*NL*
face
,
but
his
name
as
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
recollection
was
misty
and
troubled
,
however
,
like
all
his
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
an
affirmation
that
he
made
,
but
a
question
which
he
put
to
*NL*
himself
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
not
that
the
inspector
of
police
who
told
me
that
his
name
was
*NL*
Javert
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
there
was
still
time
to
intervene
in
behalf
of
that
man
.
But
,
in
*NL*
the
first
place
,
he
must
know
whether
this
was
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
called
to
Enjolras
,
who
had
just
stationed
himself
at
the
other
*NL*
extremity
of
the
barricade
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Enjolras
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
name
of
yonder
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
police
agent
.
Do
you
know
his
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
He
told
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
sprang
to
his
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
they
heard
the
report
of
the
pistol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
re-appeared
and
cried
:
``
It
is
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
gloomy
chill
traversed
Marius
'
heart
.

CHAPTER
XX
--
THE
DEAD
ARE
IN
THE
RIGHT
AND
THE
LIVING
ARE
NOT
IN
THE
*NL*
WRONG
*NL*
*NL*
The
death
agony
of
the
barricade
was
about
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
contributed
to
its
tragic
majesty
at
that
supreme
moment
;
a
*NL*
thousand
mysterious
crashes
in
the
air
,
the
breath
of
armed
masses
set
*NL*
in
movement
in
the
streets
which
were
not
visible
,
the
intermittent
*NL*
gallop
of
cavalry
,
the
heavy
shock
of
artillery
on
the
march
,
the
firing
*NL*
by
squads
,
and
the
cannonades
crossing
each
other
in
the
labyrinth
*NL*
of
Paris
,
the
smokes
of
battle
mounting
all
gilded
above
the
roofs
,
*NL*
indescribable
and
vaguely
terrible
cries
,
lightnings
of
menace
*NL*
everywhere
,
the
tocsin
of
Saint-Merry
,
which
now
had
the
accents
of
a
*NL*
sob
,
the
mildness
of
the
weather
,
the
splendor
of
the
sky
filled
with
*NL*
sun
and
clouds
,
the
beauty
of
the
day
,
and
the
alarming
silence
of
the
*NL*
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
,
since
the
preceding
evening
,
the
two
rows
of
houses
in
the
Rue
*NL*
de
la
Chanvrerie
had
become
two
walls
;
ferocious
walls
,
doors
closed
,
*NL*
windows
closed
,
shutters
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
those
days
,
so
different
from
those
in
which
we
live
,
when
the
hour
*NL*
was
come
,
when
the
people
wished
to
put
an
end
to
a
situation
,
which
had
*NL*
lasted
too
long
,
with
a
charter
granted
or
with
a
legal
country
,
when
*NL*
universal
wrath
was
diffused
in
the
atmosphere
,
when
the
city
consented
*NL*
to
the
tearing
up
of
the
pavements
,
when
insurrection
made
the
*NL*
bourgeoisie
smile
by
whispering
its
password
in
its
ear
,
then
the
*NL*
inhabitant
,
thoroughly
penetrated
with
the
revolt
,
so
to
speak
,
was
*NL*
the
auxiliary
of
the
combatant
,
and
the
house
fraternized
with
the
*NL*
improvised
fortress
which
rested
on
it
.
When
the
situation
was
not
*NL*
ripe
,
when
the
insurrection
was
not
decidedly
admitted
,
when
the
masses
*NL*
disowned
the
movement
,
all
was
over
with
the
combatants
,
the
city
was
*NL*
changed
into
a
desert
around
the
revolt
,
souls
grew
chilled
,
refuges
*NL*
were
nailed
up
,
and
the
street
turned
into
a
defile
to
help
the
army
to
*NL*
take
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
people
can
not
be
forced
,
through
surprise
,
to
walk
more
quickly
than
*NL*
it
chooses
.
Woe
to
whomsoever
tries
to
force
its
hand
!
A
people
does
not
*NL*
let
itself
go
at
random
.
Then
it
abandons
the
insurrection
to
itself
.
*NL*
The
insurgents
become
noxious
,
infected
with
the
plague
.
A
house
is
an
*NL*
escarpment
,
a
door
is
a
refusal
,
a
facade
is
a
wall
.
This
wall
hears
,
*NL*
sees
and
will
not
.
It
might
open
and
save
you
.
No
.
This
wall
is
a
judge
.
*NL*
It
gazes
at
you
and
condemns
you
.
What
dismal
things
are
closed
houses
.
*NL*
They
seem
dead
,
they
are
living
.
Life
which
is
,
as
it
were
,
suspended
*NL*
there
,
persists
there
.
No
one
has
gone
out
of
them
for
four
and
twenty
*NL*
hours
,
but
no
one
is
missing
from
them
.
In
the
interior
of
that
rock
,
*NL*
people
go
and
come
,
go
to
bed
and
rise
again
;
they
are
a
family
party
*NL*
there
;
there
they
eat
and
drink
;
they
are
afraid
,
a
terrible
thing
!
Fear
*NL*
excuses
this
fearful
lack
of
hospitality
;
terror
is
mixed
with
it
,
an
*NL*
extenuating
circumstance
.
Sometimes
,
even
,
and
this
has
been
actually
*NL*
seen
,
fear
turns
to
passion
;
fright
may
change
into
fury
,
as
prudence
*NL*
does
into
rage
;
hence
this
wise
saying
:
``
The
enraged
moderates
.
''
There
*NL*
are
outbursts
of
supreme
terror
,
whence
springs
wrath
like
a
mournful
*NL*
smoke
.
--
``
What
do
these
people
want
?
What
have
they
come
there
to
do
?
*NL*
Let
them
get
out
of
the
scrape
.
So
much
the
worse
for
them
.
It
is
their
*NL*
fault
.
They
are
only
getting
what
they
deserve
.
It
does
not
concern
*NL*
us
.
Here
is
our
poor
street
all
riddled
with
balls
.
They
are
a
pack
of
*NL*
rascals
.
Above
all
things
,
do
n't
open
the
door
.
''
--
And
the
house
assumes
*NL*
the
air
of
a
tomb
.
The
insurgent
is
in
the
death-throes
in
front
of
*NL*
that
house
;
he
sees
the
grape-shot
and
naked
swords
drawing
near
;
if
*NL*
he
cries
,
he
knows
that
they
are
listening
to
him
,
and
that
no
one
will
*NL*
come
;
there
stand
walls
which
might
protect
him
,
there
are
men
who
might
*NL*
save
him
;
and
these
walls
have
ears
of
flesh
,
and
these
men
have
bowels
*NL*
of
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whom
shall
he
reproach
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
and
every
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
incomplete
times
in
which
we
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
always
at
its
own
risk
and
peril
that
Utopia
is
converted
into
*NL*
revolution
,
and
from
philosophical
protest
becomes
an
armed
protest
,
and
*NL*
from
Minerva
turns
to
Pallas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Utopia
which
grows
impatient
and
becomes
revolt
knows
what
awaits
*NL*
it
;
it
almost
always
comes
too
soon
.
Then
it
becomes
resigned
,
and
*NL*
stoically
accepts
catastrophe
in
lieu
of
triumph
.
It
serves
those
who
*NL*
deny
it
without
complaint
,
even
excusing
them
,
and
even
disculpates
*NL*
them
,
and
its
magnanimity
consists
in
consenting
to
abandonment
.
It
is
*NL*
indomitable
in
the
face
of
obstacles
and
gentle
towards
ingratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
this
ingratitude
,
however
?
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
human
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
Progress
is
man
's
mode
of
existence
.
The
general
life
of
the
human
race
*NL*
is
called
Progress
,
the
collective
stride
of
the
human
race
is
called
*NL*
Progress
.
Progress
advances
;
it
makes
the
great
human
and
terrestrial
*NL*
journey
towards
the
celestial
and
the
divine
;
it
has
its
halting
*NL*
places
where
it
rallies
the
laggard
troop
,
it
has
its
stations
where
it
*NL*
meditates
,
in
the
presence
of
some
splendid
Canaan
suddenly
unveiled
*NL*
on
its
horizon
,
it
has
its
nights
when
it
sleeps
;
and
it
is
one
of
the
*NL*
poignant
anxieties
of
the
thinker
that
he
sees
the
shadow
resting
on
the
*NL*
human
soul
,
and
that
he
gropes
in
darkness
without
being
able
to
awaken
*NL*
that
slumbering
Progress
.

de
Nerval
one
day
to
the
writer
of
*NL*
these
lines
,
confounding
progress
with
God
,
and
taking
the
interruption
*NL*
of
movement
for
the
death
of
Being
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
who
despairs
is
in
the
wrong
.
Progress
infallibly
awakes
,
and
,
in
*NL*
short
,
we
may
say
that
it
marches
on
,
even
when
it
is
asleep
,
for
it
has
*NL*
increased
in
size
.
When
we
behold
it
erect
once
more
,
we
find
it
taller
.
*NL*
To
be
always
peaceful
does
not
depend
on
progress
any
more
than
it
does
*NL*
on
the
stream
;
erect
no
barriers
,
cast
in
no
boulders
;
obstacles
make
*NL*
water
froth
and
humanity
boil
.
Hence
arise
troubles
;
but
after
these
*NL*
troubles
,
we
recognize
the
fact
that
ground
has
been
gained
.
Until
*NL*
order
,
which
is
nothing
else
than
universal
peace
,
has
been
established
,
*NL*
until
harmony
and
unity
reign
,
progress
will
have
revolutions
as
its
*NL*
halting-places
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
,
then
,
is
progress
?
We
have
just
enunciated
it
;
the
permanent
life
*NL*
of
the
peoples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
it
sometimes
happens
,
that
the
momentary
life
of
individuals
offers
*NL*
resistance
to
the
eternal
life
of
the
human
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
admit
without
bitterness
,
that
the
individual
has
his
distinct
*NL*
interests
,
and
can
,
without
forfeiture
,
stipulate
for
his
interest
,
and
*NL*
defend
it
;
the
present
has
its
pardonable
dose
of
egotism
;
momentary
*NL*
life
has
its
rights
,
and
is
not
bound
to
sacrifice
itself
constantly
to
*NL*
the
future
.
The
generation
which
is
passing
in
its
turn
over
the
earth
,
*NL*
is
not
forced
to
abridge
it
for
the
sake
of
the
generations
,
its
equal
,
*NL*
after
all
,
who
will
have
their
turn
later
on
.
--
``
I
exist
,
''
murmurs
that
*NL*
some
one
whose
name
is
All
.
``
I
am
young
and
in
love
,
I
am
old
and
I
*NL*
wish
to
repose
,
I
am
the
father
of
a
family
,
I
toil
,
I
prosper
,
I
am
*NL*
successful
in
business
,
I
have
houses
to
lease
,
I
have
money
in
the
*NL*
government
funds
,
I
am
happy
,
I
have
a
wife
and
children
,
I
have
all
*NL*
this
,
I
desire
to
live
,
leave
me
in
peace
.
''
--
Hence
,
at
certain
hours
,
a
*NL*
profound
cold
broods
over
the
magnanimous
vanguard
of
the
human
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Utopia
,
moreover
,
we
must
admit
,
quits
its
radiant
sphere
when
it
makes
*NL*
war
.
It
,
the
truth
of
to-morrow
,
borrows
its
mode
of
procedure
,
battle
,
*NL*
from
the
lie
of
yesterday
.
It
,
the
future
,
behaves
like
the
past
.
It
,
*NL*
pure
idea
,
becomes
a
deed
of
violence
.
It
complicates
its
heroism
with
*NL*
a
violence
for
which
it
is
just
that
it
should
be
held
to
answer
;
a
*NL*
violence
of
occasion
and
expedient
,
contrary
to
principle
,
and
for
which
*NL*
it
is
fatally
punished
.
The
Utopia
,
insurrection
,
fights
with
the
old
*NL*
military
code
in
its
fist
;
it
shoots
spies
,
it
executes
traitors
;
it
*NL*
suppresses
living
beings
and
flings
them
into
unknown
darkness
.
It
makes
*NL*
use
of
death
,
a
serious
matter
.
It
seems
as
though
Utopia
had
no
longer
*NL*
any
faith
in
radiance
,
its
irresistible
and
incorruptible
force
.
It
*NL*
strikes
with
the
sword
.
Now
,
no
sword
is
simple
.
Every
blade
has
two
*NL*
edges
;
he
who
wounds
with
the
one
is
wounded
with
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
made
this
reservation
,
and
made
it
with
all
severity
,
it
is
*NL*
impossible
for
us
not
to
admire
,
whether
they
succeed
or
not
,
those
the
*NL*
glorious
combatants
of
the
future
,
the
confessors
of
Utopia
.
Even
when
*NL*
they
miscarry
,
they
are
worthy
of
veneration
;
and
it
is
,
perhaps
,
in
*NL*
failure
,
that
they
possess
the
most
majesty
.
Victory
,
when
it
is
in
*NL*
accord
with
progress
,
merits
the
applause
of
the
people
;
but
a
heroic
*NL*
defeat
merits
their
tender
compassion
.
The
one
is
magnificent
,
the
other
*NL*
sublime
.
For
our
own
part
,
we
prefer
martyrdom
to
success
.
John
Brown
is
*NL*
greater
than
Washington
,
and
Pisacane
is
greater
than
Garibaldi
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
is
necessary
that
some
one
should
take
the
part
of
the
*NL*
vanquished
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
are
unjust
towards
these
great
men
who
attempt
the
future
,
when
they
*NL*
fail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Revolutionists
are
accused
of
sowing
fear
abroad
.
Every
barricade
seems
*NL*
a
crime
.
Their
theories
are
incriminated
,
their
aim
suspected
,
their
*NL*
ulterior
motive
is
feared
,
their
conscience
denounced
.
They
are
*NL*
reproached
with
raising
,
erecting
,
and
heaping
up
,
against
the
reigning
*NL*
social
state
,
a
mass
of
miseries
,
of
griefs
,
of
iniquities
,
of
wrongs
,
*NL*
of
despairs
,
and
of
tearing
from
the
lowest
depths
blocks
of
shadow
*NL*
in
order
therein
to
embattle
themselves
and
to
combat
.
People
shout
*NL*
to
them
:
``
You
are
tearing
up
the
pavements
of
hell
!
''
They
might
reply
:
*NL*
``
That
is
because
our
barricade
is
made
of
good
intentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
best
thing
,
assuredly
,
is
the
pacific
solution
.
In
short
,
let
us
*NL*
agree
that
when
we
behold
the
pavement
,
we
think
of
the
bear
,
and
it
is
*NL*
a
good
will
which
renders
society
uneasy
.
But
it
depends
on
society
*NL*
to
save
itself
,
it
is
to
its
own
good
will
that
we
make
our
appeal
.
*NL*
No
violent
remedy
is
necessary
.
To
study
evil
amiably
,
to
prove
its
*NL*
existence
,
then
to
cure
it
.
It
is
to
this
that
we
invite
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
that
may
be
,
even
when
fallen
,
above
all
when
fallen
,
these
men
,
*NL*
who
at
every
point
of
the
universe
,
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
France
,
are
*NL*
striving
for
the
grand
work
with
the
inflexible
logic
of
the
ideal
,
*NL*
are
august
;
they
give
their
life
a
free
offering
to
progress
;
they
*NL*
accomplish
the
will
of
providence
;
they
perform
a
religious
act
.
At
the
*NL*
appointed
hour
,
with
as
much
disinterestedness
as
an
actor
who
answers
*NL*
to
his
cue
,
in
obedience
to
the
divine
stage-manager
,
they
enter
the
*NL*
tomb
.
And
this
hopeless
combat
,
this
stoical
disappearance
they
accept
*NL*
in
order
to
bring
about
the
supreme
and
universal
consequences
,
the
*NL*
magnificent
and
irresistibly
human
movement
begun
on
the
14th
of
July
,
*NL*
1789
;
these
soldiers
are
priests
.
The
French
revolution
is
an
act
of
*NL*
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
there
are
,
and
it
is
proper
to
add
this
distinction
to
the
*NL*
distinctions
already
pointed
out
in
another
chapter
,
--
there
are
accepted
*NL*
revolutions
,
revolutions
which
are
called
revolutions
;
there
are
refused
*NL*
revolutions
,
which
are
called
riots
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
insurrection
which
breaks
out
,
is
an
idea
which
is
passing
its
*NL*
examination
before
the
people
.
If
the
people
lets
fall
a
black
ball
,
the
*NL*
idea
is
dried
fruit
;
the
insurrection
is
a
mere
skirmish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waging
war
at
every
summons
and
every
time
that
Utopia
desires
it
,
is
*NL*
not
the
thing
for
the
peoples
.
Nations
have
not
always
and
at
every
hour
*NL*
the
temperament
of
heroes
and
martyrs
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
positive
.
A
priori
,
insurrection
is
repugnant
to
them
,
in
the
*NL*
first
place
,
because
it
often
results
in
a
catastrophe
,
in
the
second
*NL*
place
,
because
it
always
has
an
abstraction
as
its
point
of
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
,
and
this
is
a
noble
thing
,
it
is
always
for
the
ideal
,
and
for
*NL*
the
ideal
alone
,
that
those
who
sacrifice
themselves
do
thus
sacrifice
*NL*
themselves
.
An
insurrection
is
an
enthusiasm
.
Enthusiasm
may
wax
wroth
;
*NL*
hence
the
appeal
to
arms
.
But
every
insurrection
,
which
aims
at
a
*NL*
government
or
a
regime
,
aims
higher
.
Thus
,
for
instance
,
and
we
*NL*
insist
upon
it
,
what
the
chiefs
of
the
insurrection
of
1832
,
and
,
in
*NL*
particular
,
the
young
enthusiasts
of
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
were
*NL*
combating
,
was
not
precisely
Louis
Philippe
.
The
majority
of
them
,
*NL*
when
talking
freely
,
did
justice
to
this
king
who
stood
midway
between
*NL*
monarchy
and
revolution
;
no
one
hated
him
.
But
they
attacked
the
younger
*NL*
branch
of
the
divine
right
in
Louis
Philippe
as
they
had
attacked
its
*NL*
elder
branch
in
Charles
X.
;
and
that
which
they
wished
to
overturn
in
*NL*
overturning
royalty
in
France
,
was
,
as
we
have
explained
,
the
usurpation
*NL*
of
man
over
man
,
and
of
privilege
over
right
in
the
entire
universe
.
*NL*
Paris
without
a
king
has
as
result
the
world
without
despots
.
This
is
*NL*
the
manner
in
which
they
reasoned
.
Their
aim
was
distant
no
doubt
,
*NL*
vague
perhaps
,
and
it
retreated
in
the
face
of
their
efforts
;
but
it
was
*NL*
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
is
.
And
we
sacrifice
ourselves
for
these
visions
,
which
are
*NL*
almost
always
illusions
for
the
sacrificed
,
but
illusions
with
which
,
*NL*
after
all
,
the
whole
of
human
certainty
is
mingled
.
We
throw
ourselves
*NL*
into
these
tragic
affairs
and
become
intoxicated
with
that
which
we
are
*NL*
about
to
do
.
Who
knows
?
We
may
succeed
.
We
are
few
in
number
,
we
have
a
*NL*
whole
army
arrayed
against
us
;
but
we
are
defending
right
,
the
natural
*NL*
law
,
the
sovereignty
of
each
one
over
himself
from
which
no
abdication
*NL*
is
possible
,
justice
and
truth
,
and
in
case
of
need
,
we
die
like
the
*NL*
three
hundred
Spartans
.
We
do
not
think
of
Don
Quixote
but
of
Leonidas
.
*NL*
And
we
march
straight
before
us
,
and
once
pledged
,
we
do
not
draw
*NL*
back
,
and
we
rush
onwards
with
head
held
low
,
cherishing
as
our
hope
an
*NL*
unprecedented
victory
,
revolution
completed
,
progress
set
free
again
,
*NL*
the
aggrandizement
of
the
human
race
,
universal
deliverance
;
and
in
the
*NL*
event
of
the
worst
,
Thermopylae
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
passages
of
arms
for
the
sake
of
progress
often
suffer
shipwreck
,
*NL*
and
we
have
just
explained
why
.
The
crowd
is
restive
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
the
impulses
of
paladins
.
Heavy
masses
,
the
multitudes
which
are
fragile
*NL*
because
of
their
very
weight
,
fear
adventures
;
and
there
is
a
touch
of
*NL*
adventure
in
the
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
and
we
must
not
forget
this
,
interests
which
are
not
very
*NL*
friendly
to
the
ideal
and
the
sentimental
are
in
the
way
.
Sometimes
the
*NL*
stomach
paralyzes
the
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandeur
and
beauty
of
France
lies
in
this
,
that
she
takes
less
from
*NL*
the
stomach
than
other
nations
:
she
more
easily
knots
the
rope
about
her
*NL*
loins
.
She
is
the
first
awake
,
the
last
asleep
.
She
marches
forwards
.
*NL*
She
is
a
seeker
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
arises
from
the
fact
that
she
is
an
artist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ideal
is
nothing
but
the
culminating
point
of
logic
,
the
same
as
the
*NL*
beautiful
is
nothing
but
the
summit
of
the
true
.
Artistic
peoples
are
*NL*
also
consistent
peoples
.
To
love
beauty
is
to
see
the
light
.
That
is
why
*NL*
the
torch
of
Europe
,
that
is
to
say
of
civilization
,
was
first
borne
by
*NL*
Greece
,
who
passed
it
on
to
Italy
,
who
handed
it
on
to
France
.
Divine
,
*NL*
illuminating
nations
of
scouts
!
Vitaelampada
tradunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
an
admirable
thing
that
the
poetry
of
a
people
is
the
element
of
*NL*
its
progress
.
The
amount
of
civilization
is
measured
by
the
quantity
*NL*
of
imagination
.
Only
,
a
civilizing
people
should
remain
a
manly
people
.
*NL*
Corinth
,
yes
;
Sybaris
,
no
.
Whoever
becomes
effeminate
makes
himself
a
*NL*
bastard
.
He
must
be
neither
a
dilettante
nor
a
virtuoso
:
but
he
must
be
*NL*
artistic
.
In
the
matter
of
civilization
,
he
must
not
refine
,
but
he
must
*NL*
sublime
.
On
this
condition
,
one
gives
to
the
human
race
the
pattern
of
*NL*
the
ideal
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
modern
ideal
has
its
type
in
art
,
and
its
means
is
science
.
It
is
*NL*
through
science
that
it
will
realize
that
august
vision
of
the
poets
,
*NL*
the
socially
beautiful
.
Eden
will
be
reconstructed
by
A+B
.
At
the
point
*NL*
which
civilization
has
now
reached
,
the
exact
is
a
necessary
element
*NL*
of
the
splendid
,
and
the
artistic
sentiment
is
not
only
served
,
but
*NL*
completed
by
the
scientific
organ
;
dreams
must
be
calculated
.
Art
,
which
*NL*
is
the
conqueror
,
should
have
for
support
science
,
which
is
the
walker
;
*NL*
the
solidity
of
the
creature
which
is
ridden
is
of
importance
.
The
*NL*
modern
spirit
is
the
genius
of
Greece
with
the
genius
of
India
as
its
*NL*
vehicle
;
Alexander
on
the
elephant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Races
which
are
petrified
in
dogma
or
demoralized
by
lucre
are
unfit
to
*NL*
guide
civilization
.
Genuflection
before
the
idol
or
before
money
wastes
*NL*
away
the
muscles
which
walk
and
the
will
which
advances
.
Hieratic
or
*NL*
mercantile
absorption
lessens
a
people
's
power
of
radiance
,
lowers
its
*NL*
horizon
by
lowering
its
level
,
and
deprives
it
of
that
intelligence
,
*NL*
at
once
both
human
and
divine
of
the
universal
goal
,
which
makes
*NL*
missionaries
of
nations
.
Babylon
has
no
ideal
;
Carthage
has
no
ideal
.
*NL*
Athens
and
Rome
have
and
keep
,
throughout
all
the
nocturnal
darkness
of
*NL*
the
centuries
,
halos
of
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
France
is
in
the
same
quality
of
race
as
Greece
and
Italy
.
She
is
*NL*
Athenian
in
the
matter
of
beauty
,
and
Roman
in
her
greatness
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
she
is
good
.
She
gives
herself
.
Oftener
than
is
the
case
with
other
*NL*
races
,
is
she
in
the
humor
for
self-devotion
and
sacrifice
.
Only
,
this
*NL*
humor
seizes
upon
her
,
and
again
abandons
her
.
And
therein
lies
the
*NL*
great
peril
for
those
who
run
when
she
desires
only
to
walk
,
or
who
walk
*NL*
on
when
she
desires
to
halt
.
France
has
her
relapses
into
materialism
,
*NL*
and
,
at
certain
instants
,
the
ideas
which
obstruct
that
sublime
brain
*NL*
have
no
longer
anything
which
recalls
French
greatness
and
are
of
the
*NL*
dimensions
of
a
Missouri
or
a
South
Carolina
.
What
is
to
be
done
in
*NL*
such
a
case
?
The
giantess
plays
at
being
a
dwarf
;
immense
France
has
her
*NL*
freaks
of
pettiness
.
That
is
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
there
is
nothing
to
say
.
Peoples
,
like
planets
,
possess
the
*NL*
right
to
an
eclipse
.
And
all
is
well
,
provided
that
the
light
*NL*
returns
and
that
the
eclipse
does
not
degenerate
into
night
.
Dawn
and
*NL*
resurrection
are
synonymous
.
The
reappearance
of
the
light
is
identical
*NL*
with
the
persistence
of
the
_
I
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
state
these
facts
calmly
.
Death
on
the
barricade
or
the
tomb
in
*NL*
exile
,
is
an
acceptable
occasion
for
devotion
.
The
real
name
of
*NL*
devotion
is
disinterestedness
.
Let
the
abandoned
allow
themselves
to
*NL*
be
abandoned
,
let
the
exiled
allow
themselves
to
be
exiled
,
and
let
us
*NL*
confine
ourselves
to
entreating
great
nations
not
to
retreat
too
far
,
*NL*
when
they
do
retreat
.
One
must
not
push
too
far
in
descent
under
pretext
*NL*
of
a
return
to
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matter
exists
,
the
minute
exists
,
interest
exists
,
the
stomach
exists
;
*NL*
but
the
stomach
must
not
be
the
sole
wisdom
.
The
life
of
the
moment
has
*NL*
its
rights
,
we
admit
,
but
permanent
life
has
its
rights
also
.
Alas
!
the
*NL*
fact
that
one
is
mounted
does
not
preclude
a
fall
.
This
can
be
seen
in
*NL*
history
more
frequently
than
is
desirable
:
A
nation
is
great
,
it
tastes
*NL*
the
ideal
,
then
it
bites
the
mire
,
and
finds
it
good
;
and
if
it
be
asked
*NL*
how
it
happens
that
it
has
abandoned
Socrates
for
Falstaff
,
it
replies
:
*NL*
``
Because
I
love
statesmen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
word
more
before
returning
to
our
subject
,
the
conflict
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
battle
like
the
one
which
we
are
engaged
in
describing
is
nothing
else
*NL*
than
a
convulsion
towards
the
ideal
.
Progress
trammelled
is
sickly
,
and
*NL*
is
subject
to
these
tragic
epilepsies
.
With
that
malady
of
progress
,
*NL*
civil
war
,
we
have
been
obliged
to
come
in
contact
in
our
passage
.
This
*NL*
is
one
of
the
fatal
phases
,
at
once
act
and
entr
`
acte
of
that
drama
*NL*
whose
pivot
is
a
social
condemnation
,
and
whose
veritable
title
is
*NL*
Progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Progress
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
cry
to
which
we
frequently
give
utterance
is
our
whole
thought
;
and
,
*NL*
at
the
point
of
this
drama
which
we
have
now
reached
,
the
idea
which
it
*NL*
contains
having
still
more
than
one
trial
to
undergo
,
it
is
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
permitted
to
us
,
if
not
to
lift
the
veil
from
it
,
to
at
least
allow
its
*NL*
light
to
shine
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
which
the
reader
has
under
his
eye
at
this
moment
is
,
from
*NL*
one
end
to
the
other
,
as
a
whole
and
in
detail
,
whatever
may
be
its
*NL*
intermittences
,
exceptions
and
faults
,
the
march
from
evil
to
good
,
from
*NL*
the
unjust
to
the
just
,
from
night
to
day
,
from
appetite
to
conscience
,
*NL*
from
rottenness
to
life
,
from
hell
to
heaven
,
from
nothingness
to
God
.
*NL*
Point
of
departure
:

CHAPTER
XXI
--
THE
HEROES
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
the
drum
beat
the
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
attack
was
a
hurricane
.
On
the
evening
before
,
in
the
darkness
,
*NL*
the
barricade
had
been
approached
silently
,
as
by
a
boa
.
Now
,
in
broad
*NL*
daylight
,
in
that
widening
street
,
surprise
was
decidedly
impossible
,
*NL*
rude
force
had
,
moreover
,
been
unmasked
,
the
cannon
had
begun
the
*NL*
roar
,
the
army
hurled
itself
on
the
barricade
.
Fury
now
became
skill
.
*NL*
A
powerful
detachment
of
infantry
of
the
line
,
broken
at
regular
*NL*
intervals
,
by
the
National
Guard
and
the
Municipal
Guard
on
foot
,
*NL*
and
supported
by
serried
masses
which
could
be
heard
though
not
seen
,
*NL*
debauched
into
the
street
at
a
run
,
with
drums
beating
,
trumpets
*NL*
braying
,
bayonets
levelled
,
the
sappers
at
their
head
,
and
,
*NL*
imperturbable
under
the
projectiles
,
charged
straight
for
the
barricade
*NL*
with
the
weight
of
a
brazen
beam
against
a
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wall
held
firm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurgents
fired
impetuously
.
The
barricade
once
scaled
had
a
mane
*NL*
of
lightning
flashes
.
The
assault
was
so
furious
,
that
for
one
moment
,
*NL*
it
was
inundated
with
assailants
;
but
it
shook
off
the
soldiers
as
the
*NL*
lion
shakes
off
the
dogs
,
and
it
was
only
covered
with
besiegers
as
*NL*
the
cliff
is
covered
with
foam
,
to
re-appear
,
a
moment
later
,
beetling
,
*NL*
black
and
formidable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
column
,
forced
to
retreat
,
remained
massed
in
the
street
,
*NL*
unprotected
but
terrible
,
and
replied
to
the
redoubt
with
a
terrible
*NL*
discharge
of
musketry
.
Any
one
who
has
seen
fireworks
will
recall
the
*NL*
sheaf
formed
of
interlacing
lightnings
which
is
called
a
bouquet
.
Let
*NL*
the
reader
picture
to
himself
this
bouquet
,
no
longer
vertical
but
*NL*
horizontal
,
bearing
a
bullet
,
buck-shot
or
a
biscaien
at
the
tip
of
each
*NL*
one
of
its
jets
of
flame
,
and
picking
off
dead
men
one
after
another
*NL*
from
its
clusters
of
lightning
.
The
barricade
was
underneath
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
both
sides
,
the
resolution
was
equal
.
The
bravery
exhibited
there
*NL*
was
almost
barbarous
and
was
complicated
with
a
sort
of
heroic
ferocity
*NL*
which
began
by
the
sacrifice
of
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
epoch
when
a
National
Guardsman
fought
like
a
Zouave
.
*NL*
The
troop
wished
to
make
an
end
of
it
,
insurrection
was
desirous
of
*NL*
fighting
.
The
acceptance
of
the
death
agony
in
the
flower
of
youth
and
*NL*
in
the
flush
of
health
turns
intrepidity
into
frenzy
.
In
this
fray
,
each
*NL*
one
underwent
the
broadening
growth
of
the
death
hour
.
The
street
was
*NL*
strewn
with
corpses
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
barricade
had
Enjolras
at
one
of
its
extremities
and
Marius
at
the
*NL*
other
.
Enjolras
,
who
carried
the
whole
barricade
in
his
head
,
reserved
*NL*
and
sheltered
himself
;
three
soldiers
fell
,
one
after
the
other
,
under
*NL*
his
embrasure
,
without
having
even
seen
him
;
Marius
fought
unprotected
.
*NL*
He
made
himself
a
target
.
He
stood
with
more
than
half
his
body
above
*NL*
the
breastworks
.
There
is
no
more
violent
prodigal
than
the
avaricious
*NL*
man
who
takes
the
bit
in
his
teeth
;
there
is
no
man
more
terrible
in
*NL*
action
than
a
dreamer
.
Marius
was
formidable
and
pensive
.
In
battle
he
*NL*
was
as
in
a
dream
.
One
would
have
pronounced
him
a
phantom
engaged
in
*NL*
firing
a
gun
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
insurgents
'
cartridges
were
giving
out
;
but
not
their
sarcasms
.
In
*NL*
this
whirlwind
of
the
sepulchre
in
which
they
stood
,
they
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
was
bare-headed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
done
with
your
hat
?
''
Bossuet
asked
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Courfeyrac
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
finally
taken
it
away
from
me
with
cannon-balls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Or
they
uttered
haughty
comments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
any
one
understand
,
''
exclaimed
Feuilly
bitterly
,
``
those
men
,
--
-LSB-
and
*NL*
he
cited
names
,
well-known
names
,
even
celebrated
names
,
some
belonging
*NL*
to
the
old
army
-RSB-
--
who
had
promised
to
join
us
,
and
taken
an
oath
to
aid
*NL*
us
,
and
who
had
pledged
their
honor
to
it
,
and
who
are
our
generals
,
and
*NL*
who
abandon
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Combeferre
restricted
himself
to
replying
with
a
grave
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
people
who
observe
the
rules
of
honor
as
one
observes
the
*NL*
stars
,
from
a
great
distance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
of
the
barricade
was
so
strewn
with
torn
cartridges
that
*NL*
one
would
have
said
that
there
had
been
a
snowstorm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assailants
had
numbers
in
their
favor
;
the
insurgents
had
position
.
*NL*
They
were
at
the
top
of
a
wall
,
and
they
thundered
point-blank
upon
*NL*
the
soldiers
tripping
over
the
dead
and
wounded
and
entangled
in
*NL*
the
escarpment
.
This
barricade
,
constructed
as
it
was
and
admirably
*NL*
buttressed
,
was
really
one
of
those
situations
where
a
handful
of
men
*NL*
hold
a
legion
in
check
.
Nevertheless
,
the
attacking
column
,
constantly
*NL*
recruited
and
enlarged
under
the
shower
of
bullets
,
drew
inexorably
*NL*
nearer
,
and
now
,
little
by
little
,
step
by
step
,
but
surely
,
the
army
*NL*
closed
in
around
the
barricade
as
the
vice
grasps
the
wine-press
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
assault
followed
another
.
The
horror
of
the
situation
kept
*NL*
increasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
burst
forth
on
that
heap
of
paving-stones
,
in
that
Rue
de
la
*NL*
Chanvrerie
,
a
battle
worthy
of
a
wall
of
Troy
.
These
haggard
,
ragged
,
*NL*
exhausted
men
,
who
had
had
nothing
to
eat
for
four
and
twenty
hours
,
who
*NL*
had
not
slept
,
who
had
but
a
few
more
rounds
to
fire
,
who
were
fumbling
*NL*
in
their
pockets
which
had
been
emptied
of
cartridges
,
nearly
all
*NL*
of
whom
were
wounded
,
with
head
or
arm
bandaged
with
black
and
*NL*
blood-stained
linen
,
with
holes
in
their
clothes
from
which
the
blood
*NL*
trickled
,
and
who
were
hardly
armed
with
poor
guns
and
notched
swords
,
*NL*
became
Titans
.
The
barricade
was
ten
times
attacked
,
approached
,
*NL*
assailed
,
scaled
,
and
never
captured
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
form
an
idea
of
this
struggle
,
it
is
necessary
to
imagine
*NL*
fire
set
to
a
throng
of
terrible
courages
,
and
then
to
gaze
at
the
*NL*
conflagration
.
It
was
not
a
combat
,
it
was
the
interior
of
a
furnace
;
*NL*
there
mouths
breathed
the
flame
;
there
countenances
were
extraordinary
.
*NL*
The
human
form
seemed
impossible
there
,
the
combatants
flamed
forth
*NL*
there
,
and
it
was
formidable
to
behold
the
going
and
coming
in
that
red
*NL*
glow
of
those
salamanders
of
the
fray
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
successive
and
simultaneous
scenes
of
this
grand
slaughter
we
*NL*
renounce
all
attempts
at
depicting
.
The
epic
alone
has
the
right
to
fill
*NL*
twelve
thousand
verses
with
a
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
pronounced
this
that
hell
of
Brahmanism
,
the
most
*NL*
redoubtable
of
the
seventeen
abysses
,
which
the
Veda
calls
the
Forest
of
*NL*
Swords
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
fought
hand
to
hand
,
foot
to
foot
,
with
pistol
shots
,
with
blows
of
*NL*
the
sword
,
with
their
fists
,
at
a
distance
,
close
at
hand
,
from
above
,
*NL*
from
below
,
from
everywhere
,
from
the
roofs
of
the
houses
,
from
the
*NL*
windows
of
the
wine-shop
,
from
the
cellar
windows
,
whither
some
had
*NL*
crawled
.
They
were
one
against
sixty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
facade
of
Corinthe
,
half
demolished
,
was
hideous
.
The
window
,
*NL*
tattooed
with
grape-shot
,
had
lost
glass
and
frame
and
was
nothing
now
*NL*
but
a
shapeless
hole
,
tumultuously
blocked
with
paving-stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bossuet
was
killed
;
Feuilly
was
killed
;
Courfeyrac
was
killed
;
*NL*
Combeferre
,
transfixed
by
three
blows
from
a
bayonet
in
the
breast
at
*NL*
the
moment
when
he
was
lifting
up
a
wounded
soldier
,
had
only
time
to
*NL*
cast
a
glance
to
heaven
when
he
expired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
still
fighting
,
was
so
riddled
with
wounds
,
particularly
in
the
*NL*
head
,
that
his
countenance
disappeared
beneath
the
blood
,
and
one
would
*NL*
have
said
that
his
face
was
covered
with
a
red
kerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
alone
was
not
struck
.
When
he
had
no
longer
any
weapon
,
he
*NL*
reached
out
his
hands
to
right
and
left
and
an
insurgent
thrust
some
arm
*NL*
or
other
into
his
fist
.
All
he
had
left
was
the
stumps
of
four
swords
;
*NL*
one
more
than
Francois
I.
at
Marignan
.

In

exploits
,
*NL*
Esplandian
attacks
the
giant
marquis
Swantibore
with
a
cobbler
's
*NL*
shoulder-stick
of
fire

and
the
latter
defends
himself
by
stoning
the
*NL*
hero
with
towers
which
he
plucks
up
by
the
roots

Our

two

*NL*
each
other
,
their
battle-axes
in
hand
,
masked
with
iron
,
gloved
with
*NL*
iron
,
booted
with
iron
,
the
one
caparisoned
in
ermine
,
the
other
draped
*NL*
in
azure
:
Bretagne
with
his
lion
between
the
two
horns
of
his
crown
,
*NL*
Bourbon
helmeted
with
a
monster
fleur
de
lys
on
his
visor
.
But
,
in
order
*NL*
to
be
superb
,
it
is
not
necessary
to
wear
,
like
Yvon
,
the
ducal
morion
,
*NL*
to
have
in
the
fist
,
like
Esplandian
,
a
living
flame
,
or
,
like
Phyles
,
*NL*
father
of
Polydamas
,
to
have
brought
back
from
Ephyra
a
good
suit
of
*NL*
mail
,
a
present
from
the
king
of
men
,
Euphetes
;
it
suffices
to
give
*NL*
one
's
life
for
a
conviction
or
a
loyalty
.
This
ingenuous
little
*NL*
soldier
,
yesterday
a
peasant
of
Bauce
or
Limousin
,
who
prowls
with
his
*NL*
clasp-knife
by
his
side
,
around
the
children
's
nurses
in
the
Luxembourg
*NL*
garden
,
this
pale
young
student
bent
over
a
piece
of
anatomy
or
a
book
,
*NL*
a
blond
youth
who
shaves
his
beard
with
scissors
,
--
take
both
of
them
,
*NL*
breathe
upon
them
with
a
breath
of
duty
,
place
them
face
to
face
in
the
*NL*
Carrefour
Boucherat
or
in
the
blind
alley
Planche-Mibray
,
and
let
the
*NL*
one
fight
for
his
flag
,
and
the
other
for
his
ideal
,
and
let
both
of
*NL*
them
imagine
that
they
are
fighting
for
their
country
;
the
struggle
will
*NL*
be
colossal
;
and
the
shadow
which
this
raw
recruit
and
this
sawbones
*NL*
in
conflict
will
produce
in
that
grand
epic
field
where
humanity
*NL*
is
striving
,
will
equal
the
shadow
cast
by
Megaryon
,
King
of
Lycia
,
*NL*
tiger-filled
,
crushing
in
his
embrace
the
immense
body
of
Ajax
,
equal

CHAPTER
XXII
--
FOOT
TO
FOOT
*NL*
*NL*
When
there
were
no
longer
any
of
the
leaders
left
alive
,
except
Enjolras
*NL*
and
Marius
at
the
two
extremities
of
the
barricade
,
the
centre
,
which
*NL*
had
so
long
sustained
Courfeyrac
,
Joly
,
Bossuet
,
Feuilly
and
Combeferre
,
*NL*
gave
way
.
The
cannon
,
though
it
had
not
effected
a
practicable
breach
,
*NL*
had
made
a
rather
large
hollow
in
the
middle
of
the
redoubt
;
there
,
the
*NL*
summit
of
the
wall
had
disappeared
before
the
balls
,
and
had
crumbled
*NL*
away
;
and
the
rubbish
which
had
fallen
,
now
inside
,
now
outside
,
had
,
*NL*
as
it
accumulated
,
formed
two
piles
in
the
nature
of
slopes
on
the
two
*NL*
sides
of
the
barrier
,
one
on
the
inside
,
the
other
on
the
outside
.
The
*NL*
exterior
slope
presented
an
inclined
plane
to
the
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
final
assault
was
there
attempted
,
and
this
assault
succeeded
.
The
*NL*
mass
bristling
with
bayonets
and
hurled
forward
at
a
run
,
came
up
with
*NL*
irresistible
force
,
and
the
serried
front
of
battle
of
the
attacking
*NL*
column
made
its
appearance
through
the
smoke
on
the
crest
of
the
*NL*
battlements
.
This
time
,
it
was
decisive
.
The
group
of
insurgents
who
*NL*
were
defending
the
centre
retreated
in
confusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
gloomy
love
of
life
awoke
once
more
in
some
of
them
.
Many
,
*NL*
finding
themselves
under
the
muzzles
of
this
forest
of
guns
,
did
not
*NL*
wish
to
die
.
This
is
a
moment
when
the
instinct
of
self-preservation
*NL*
emits
howls
,
when
the
beast
re-appears
in
men
.
They
were
hemmed
in
by
*NL*
the
lofty
,
six-story
house
which
formed
the
background
of
their
redoubt
.
*NL*
This
house
might
prove
their
salvation
.
The
building
was
barricaded
,
and
*NL*
walled
,
as
it
were
,
from
top
to
bottom
.
Before
the
troops
of
the
line
*NL*
had
reached
the
interior
of
the
redoubt
,
there
was
time
for
a
door
to
*NL*
open
and
shut
,
the
space
of
a
flash
of
lightning
was
sufficient
for
*NL*
that
,
and
the
door
of
that
house
,
suddenly
opened
a
crack
and
closed
*NL*
again
instantly
,
was
life
for
these
despairing
men
.
Behind
this
house
,
*NL*
there
were
streets
,
possible
flight
,
space
.
They
set
to
knocking
at
that
*NL*
door
with
the
butts
of
their
guns
,
and
with
kicks
,
shouting
,
calling
,
*NL*
entreating
,
wringing
their
hands
.
No
one
opened
.
From
the
little
window
*NL*
on
the
third
floor
,
the
head
of
the
dead
man
gazed
down
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Enjolras
and
Marius
,
and
the
seven
or
eight
rallied
about
them
,
*NL*
sprang
forward
and
protected
them
.
Enjolras
had
shouted
to
the
soldiers
:
*NL*
``
Do
n't
advance
!
''
and
as
an
officer
had
not
obeyed
,
Enjolras
had
killed
*NL*
the
officer
.
He
was
now
in
the
little
inner
court
of
the
redoubt
,
with
*NL*
his
back
planted
against
the
Corinthe
building
,
a
sword
in
one
hand
,
*NL*
a
rifle
in
the
other
,
holding
open
the
door
of
the
wine-shop
which
he
*NL*
barred
against
assailants
.
He
shouted
to
the
desperate
men
:
--
``
There
is
*NL*
but
one
door
open
;
this
one
.
''
--
And
shielding
them
with
his
body
,
and
*NL*
facing
an
entire
battalion
alone
,
he
made
them
pass
in
behind
him
.
All
*NL*
precipitated
themselves
thither
.
Enjolras
,
executing
with
his
rifle
,
*NL*
which
he
now
used
like
a
cane
,
what
single-stick
players
call
a
``
covered
*NL*
rose
''
round
his
head
,
levelled
the
bayonets
around
and
in
front
of
him
,
*NL*
and
was
the
last
to
enter
;
and
then
ensued
a
horrible
moment
,
when
the
*NL*
soldiers
tried
to
make
their
way
in
,
and
the
insurgents
strove
to
bar
*NL*
them
out
.
The
door
was
slammed
with
such
violence
,
that
,
as
it
fell
back
*NL*
into
its
frame
,
it
showed
the
five
fingers
of
a
soldier
who
had
been
*NL*
clinging
to
it
,
cut
off
and
glued
to
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
remained
outside
.
A
shot
had
just
broken
his
collar
bone
,
he
*NL*
felt
that
he
was
fainting
and
falling
.
At
that
moment
,
with
eyes
already
*NL*
shut
,
he
felt
the
shock
of
a
vigorous
hand
seizing
him
,
and
the
swoon
*NL*
in
which
his
senses
vanished
,
hardly
allowed
him
time
for
the
thought
,
*NL*
mingled
with
a
last
memory
of
Cosette
:
--
``
I
am
taken
prisoner
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
shot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
not
seeing
Marius
among
those
who
had
taken
refuge
in
the
*NL*
wine-shop
,
had
the
same
idea
.
But
they
had
reached
a
moment
when
each
*NL*
man
has
not
the
time
to
meditate
on
his
own
death
.
Enjolras
fixed
the
*NL*
bar
across
the
door
,
and
bolted
it
,
and
double-locked
it
with
key
and
*NL*
chain
,
while
those
outside
were
battering
furiously
at
it
,
the
soldiers
*NL*
with
the
butts
of
their
muskets
,
the
sappers
with
their
axes
.
The
*NL*
assailants
were
grouped
about
that
door
.
The
siege
of
the
wine-shop
was
*NL*
now
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
,
we
will
observe
,
were
full
of
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
death
of
the
artillery-sergeant
had
enraged
them
,
and
then
,
a
still
*NL*
more
melancholy
circumstance
.
During
the
few
hours
which
had
preceded
*NL*
the
attack
,
it
had
been
reported
among
them
that
the
insurgents
were
*NL*
mutilating
their
prisoners
,
and
that
there
was
the
headless
body
of
*NL*
a
soldier
in
the
wine-shop
.
This
sort
of
fatal
rumor
is
the
usual
*NL*
accompaniment
of
civil
wars
,
and
it
was
a
false
report
of
this
kind
*NL*
which
,
later
on
,
produced
the
catastrophe
of
the
Rue
Transnonain
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
door
was
barricaded
,
Enjolras
said
to
the
others
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
sell
our
lives
dearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
approached
the
table
on
which
lay
Mabeuf
and
Gavroche
.
Beneath
*NL*
the
black
cloth
two
straight
and
rigid
forms
were
visible
,
one
large
,
*NL*
the
other
small
,
and
the
two
faces
were
vaguely
outlined
beneath
the
*NL*
cold
folds
of
the
shroud
.
A
hand
projected
from
beneath
the
winding
*NL*
sheet
and
hung
near
the
floor
.
It
was
that
of
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
bent
down
and
kissed
that
venerable
hand
,
just
as
he
had
kissed
*NL*
his
brow
on
the
preceding
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
only
two
kisses
which
he
had
bestowed
in
the
course
of
*NL*
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
abridge
the
tale
.
The
barricade
had
fought
like
a
gate
of
Thebes
;
*NL*
the
wine-shop
fought
like
a
house
of
Saragossa
.
These
resistances
are
*NL*
dogged
.
No
quarter
.
No
flag
of
truce
possible
.
Men
are
willing
to
die
,
*NL*
provided
their
opponent
will
kill
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Suchet
says
:
--
``
Capitulate
,
''
--
Palafox
replies
:
``
After
the
war
with
*NL*
cannon
,
the
war
with
knives
.
''
Nothing
was
lacking
in
the
capture
by
*NL*
assault
of
the
Hucheloup
wine-shop
;
neither
paving-stones
raining
from
*NL*
the
windows
and
the
roof
on
the
besiegers
and
exasperating
the
soldiers
*NL*
by
crushing
them
horribly
,
nor
shots
fired
from
the
attic-windows
and
*NL*
the
cellar
,
nor
the
fury
of
attack
,
nor
,
finally
,
when
the
door
yielded
,
*NL*
the
frenzied
madness
of
extermination
.
The
assailants
,
rushing
into
the
*NL*
wine-shop
,
their
feet
entangled
in
the
panels
of
the
door
which
had
been
*NL*
beaten
in
and
flung
on
the
ground
,
found
not
a
single
combatant
there
.
*NL*
The
spiral
staircase
,
hewn
asunder
with
the
axe
,
lay
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
tap-room
,
a
few
wounded
men
were
just
breathing
their
last
,
every
*NL*
one
who
was
not
killed
was
on
the
first
floor
,
and
from
there
,
through
*NL*
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
,
which
had
formed
the
entrance
of
the
stairs
,
*NL*
a
terrific
fire
burst
forth
.
It
was
the
last
of
their
cartridges
.
When
*NL*
they
were
exhausted
,
when
these
formidable
men
on
the
point
of
death
had
*NL*
no
longer
either
powder
or
ball
,
each
grasped
in
his
hands
two
of
the
*NL*
bottles
which
Enjolras
had
reserved
,
and
of
which
we
have
spoken
,
and
*NL*
held
the
scaling
party
in
check
with
these
frightfully
fragile
clubs
.
*NL*
They
were
bottles
of
aquafortis
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
relate
these
gloomy
incidents
of
carnage
as
they
occurred
.
The
*NL*
besieged
man
,
alas
!
converts
everything
into
a
weapon
.
Greek
fire
did
*NL*
not
disgrace
Archimedes
,
boiling
pitch
did
not
disgrace
Bayard
.
All
war
*NL*
is
a
thing
of
terror
,
and
there
is
no
choice
in
it
.
The
musketry
of
the
*NL*
besiegers
,
though
confined
and
embarrassed
by
being
directed
from
below
*NL*
upwards
,
was
deadly
.
The
rim
of
the
hole
in
the
ceiling
was
speedily
*NL*
surrounded
by
heads
of
the
slain
,
whence
dripped
long
,
red
and
smoking
*NL*
streams
,
the
uproar
was
indescribable
;
a
close
and
burning
smoke
almost
*NL*
produced
night
over
this
combat
.
Words
are
lacking
to
express
horror
*NL*
when
it
has
reached
this
pitch
.
There
were
no
longer
men
in
this
*NL*
conflict
,
which
was
now
infernal
.
They
were
no
longer
giants
matched
*NL*
with
colossi
.
It
resembled
Milton
and
Dante
rather
than
Homer
.
Demons
*NL*
attacked
,
spectres
resisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
heroism
become
monstrous
.

CHAPTER
XXIII
--
ORESTES
FASTING
AND
PYLADES
DRUNK
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
by
dint
of
mounting
on
each
other
's
backs
,
aiding
themselves
*NL*
with
the
skeleton
of
the
staircase
,
climbing
up
the
walls
,
clinging
to
*NL*
the
ceiling
,
slashing
away
at
the
very
brink
of
the
trap-door
,
the
last
*NL*
one
who
offered
resistance
,
a
score
of
assailants
,
soldiers
,
National
*NL*
Guardsmen
,
municipal
guardsmen
,
in
utter
confusion
,
the
majority
*NL*
disfigured
by
wounds
in
the
face
during
that
redoubtable
ascent
,
blinded
*NL*
by
blood
,
furious
,
rendered
savage
,
made
an
irruption
into
the
apartment
*NL*
on
the
first
floor
.
There
they
found
only
one
man
still
on
his
feet
,
*NL*
Enjolras
.
Without
cartridges
,
without
sword
,
he
had
nothing
in
his
hand
*NL*
now
but
the
barrel
of
his
gun
whose
stock
he
had
broken
over
the
head
*NL*
of
those
who
were
entering
.
He
had
placed
the
billiard
table
between
his
*NL*
assailants
and
himself
;
he
had
retreated
into
the
corner
of
the
room
,
*NL*
and
there
,
with
haughty
eye
,
and
head
borne
high
,
with
this
stump
of
a
*NL*
weapon
in
his
hand
,
he
was
still
so
alarming
as
to
speedily
create
an
*NL*
empty
space
around
him
.
A
cry
arose
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
leader
!
It
was
he
who
slew
the
artillery-man
.
It
is
well
that
*NL*
he
has
placed
himself
there
.
Let
him
remain
there
.
Let
us
shoot
him
down
*NL*
on
the
spot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shoot
me
,
''
said
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
flinging
away
his
bit
of
gun-barrel
,
and
folding
his
arms
,
he
*NL*
offered
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
audacity
of
a
fine
death
always
affects
men
.
As
soon
as
Enjolras
*NL*
folded
his
arms
and
accepted
his
end
,
the
din
of
strife
ceased
in
*NL*
the
room
,
and
this
chaos
suddenly
stilled
into
a
sort
of
sepulchral
*NL*
solemnity
.
The
menacing
majesty
of
Enjolras
disarmed
and
motionless
,
*NL*
appeared
to
oppress
this
tumult
,
and
this
young
man
,
haughty
,
bloody
,
*NL*
and
charming
,
who
alone
had
not
a
wound
,
who
was
as
indifferent
as
an
*NL*
invulnerable
being
,
seemed
,
by
the
authority
of
his
tranquil
glance
,
to
*NL*
constrain
this
sinister
rabble
to
kill
him
respectfully
.
His
beauty
,
at
*NL*
that
moment
augmented
by
his
pride
,
was
resplendent
,
and
he
was
fresh
*NL*
and
rosy
after
the
fearful
four
and
twenty
hours
which
had
just
elapsed
,
*NL*
as
though
he
could
no
more
be
fatigued
than
wounded
.
It
was
of
him
,
*NL*
possibly
,
that
a
witness
spoke
afterwards
,
before
the
council
of
*NL*
war
:
``
There
was
an
insurgent
whom
I
heard
called
Apollo
.
''
A
National
*NL*
Guardsman
who
had
taken
aim
at
Enjolras
,
lowered
his
gun
,
saying
:
``
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
I
am
about
to
shoot
a
flower
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Twelve
men
formed
into
a
squad
in
the
corner
opposite
Enjolras
,
and
*NL*
silently
made
ready
their
guns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
sergeant
shouted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
aim
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
officer
intervened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
addressing
Enjolras
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
wish
to
have
your
eyes
bandaged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
you
who
killed
the
artillery
sergeant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
had
waked
up
a
few
moments
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
had
been
asleep
ever
since
the
*NL*
preceding
evening
in
the
upper
room
of
the
wine-shop
,
seated
on
a
chair
*NL*
and
leaning
on
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
realized
in
its
fullest
sense
the
old
metaphor
of
``
dead
drunk
.
''
The
*NL*
hideous
potion
of
absinthe-porter
and
alcohol
had
thrown
him
into
a
*NL*
lethargy
.
His
table
being
small
,
and
not
suitable
for
the
barricade
,
*NL*
he
had
been
left
in
possession
of
it
.
He
was
still
in
the
same
posture
,
*NL*
with
his
breast
bent
over
the
table
,
his
head
lying
flat
on
his
arms
,
*NL*
surrounded
by
glasses
,
beer-jugs
and
bottles
.
His
was
the
overwhelming
*NL*
slumber
of
the
torpid
bear
and
the
satiated
leech
.
Nothing
had
had
any
*NL*
effect
upon
it
,
neither
the
fusillade
,
nor
the
cannon-balls
,
nor
the
*NL*
grape-shot
which
had
made
its
way
through
the
window
into
the
room
where
*NL*
he
was
.
Nor
the
tremendous
uproar
of
the
assault
.
He
merely
replied
to
*NL*
the
cannonade
,
now
and
then
,
by
a
snore
.
He
seemed
to
be
waiting
there
*NL*
for
a
bullet
which
should
spare
him
the
trouble
of
waking
.
Many
corpses
*NL*
were
strewn
around
him
;
and
,
at
the
first
glance
,
there
was
nothing
to
*NL*
distinguish
him
from
those
profound
sleepers
of
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Noise
does
not
rouse
a
drunken
man
;
silence
awakens
him
.
The
fall
*NL*
of
everything
around
him
only
augmented
Grantaire
's
prostration
;
the
*NL*
crumbling
of
all
things
was
his
lullaby
.
The
sort
of
halt
which
the
*NL*
tumult
underwent
in
the
presence
of
Enjolras
was
a
shock
to
this
heavy
*NL*
slumber
.
It
had
the
effect
of
a
carriage
going
at
full
speed
,
which
*NL*
suddenly
comes
to
a
dead
stop
.
The
persons
dozing
within
it
wake
up
.
*NL*
Grantaire
rose
to
his
feet
with
a
start
,
stretched
out
his
arms
,
rubbed
*NL*
his
eyes
,
stared
,
yawned
,
and
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fit
of
drunkenness
reaching
its
end
resembles
a
curtain
which
is
torn
*NL*
away
.
One
beholds
,
at
a
single
glance
and
as
a
whole
,
all
that
it
has
*NL*
concealed
.
All
suddenly
presents
itself
to
the
memory
;
and
the
drunkard
*NL*
who
has
known
nothing
of
what
has
been
taking
place
during
the
last
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
,
has
no
sooner
opened
his
eyes
than
he
is
perfectly
*NL*
informed
.
Ideas
recur
to
him
with
abrupt
lucidity
;
the
obliteration
*NL*
of
intoxication
,
a
sort
of
steam
which
has
obscured
the
brain
,
is
*NL*
dissipated
,
and
makes
way
for
the
clear
and
sharply
outlined
importunity
*NL*
of
realities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Relegated
,
as
he
was
,
to
one
corner
,
and
sheltered
behind
the
*NL*
billiard-table
,
the
soldiers
whose
eyes
were
fixed
on
Enjolras
,
had
not
*NL*
even
noticed
Grantaire
,
and
the
sergeant
was
preparing
to
repeat
his
*NL*
order
:
``
Take
aim
!
''
when
all
at
once
,
they
heard
a
strong
voice
shout
*NL*
beside
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Long
live
the
Republic
!
I
'm
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
had
risen
.
The
immense
gleam
of
the
whole
combat
which
he
*NL*
had
missed
,
and
in
which
he
had
had
no
part
,
appeared
in
the
brilliant
*NL*
glance
of
the
transfigured
drunken
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
:
``
Long
live
the
Republic
!
''
crossed
the
room
with
a
firm
*NL*
stride
and
placed
himself
in
front
of
the
guns
beside
Enjolras
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Finish
both
of
us
at
one
blow
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
turning
gently
to
Enjolras
,
he
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
permit
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
pressed
his
hand
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
smile
was
not
ended
when
the
report
resounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enjolras
,
pierced
by
eight
bullets
,
remained
leaning
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
as
though
the
balls
had
nailed
him
there
.
Only
,
his
head
was
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grantaire
fell
at
his
feet
,
as
though
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
,
the
soldiers
dislodged
the
last
remaining
*NL*
insurgents
,
who
had
taken
refuge
at
the
top
of
the
house
.
They
fired
*NL*
into
the
attic
through
a
wooden
lattice
.
They
fought
under
the
very
*NL*
roof
.
They
flung
bodies
,
some
of
them
still
alive
,
out
through
the
*NL*
windows
.
Two
light-infantrymen
,
who
tried
to
lift
the
shattered
omnibus
,
*NL*
were
slain
by
two
shots
fired
from
the
attic
.
A
man
in
a
blouse
was
*NL*
flung
down
from
it
,
with
a
bayonet
wound
in
the
abdomen
,
and
breathed
*NL*
his
last
on
the
ground
.
A
soldier
and
an
insurgent
slipped
together
*NL*
on
the
sloping
slates
of
the
roof
,
and
,
as
they
would
not
release
each
*NL*
other
,
they
fell
,
clasped
in
a
ferocious
embrace
.
A
similar
conflict
*NL*
went
on
in
the
cellar
.
Shouts
,
shots
,
a
fierce
trampling
.
Then
silence
.
*NL*
The
barricade
was
captured
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soldiers
began
to
search
the
houses
round
about
,
and
to
pursue
the
*NL*
fugitives
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
--
PRISONER
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
,
in
fact
,
a
prisoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
which
had
seized
him
from
behind
and
whose
grasp
he
had
felt
*NL*
at
the
moment
of
his
fall
and
his
loss
of
consciousness
was
that
of
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
taken
no
other
part
in
the
combat
than
to
expose
*NL*
himself
in
it
.
Had
it
not
been
for
him
,
no
one
,
in
that
supreme
phase
*NL*
of
agony
,
would
have
thought
of
the
wounded
.
Thanks
to
him
,
everywhere
*NL*
present
in
the
carnage
,
like
a
providence
,
those
who
fell
were
picked
*NL*
up
,
transported
to
the
tap-room
,
and
cared
for
.
In
the
intervals
,
he
*NL*
reappeared
on
the
barricade
.
But
nothing
which
could
resemble
a
blow
,
*NL*
an
attack
or
even
personal
defence
proceeded
from
his
hands
.
He
held
his
*NL*
peace
and
lent
succor
.
Moreover
he
had
received
only
a
few
scratches
.
*NL*
The
bullets
would
have
none
of
him
.
If
suicide
formed
part
of
what
he
*NL*
had
meditated
on
coming
to
this
sepulchre
,
to
that
spot
,
he
had
*NL*
not
succeeded
.
But
we
doubt
whether
he
had
thought
of
suicide
,
an
*NL*
irreligious
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
in
the
thick
cloud
of
the
combat
,
did
not
appear
to
see
*NL*
Marius
;
the
truth
is
,
that
he
never
took
his
eyes
from
the
latter
.
When
*NL*
a
shot
laid
Marius
low
,
Jean
Valjean
leaped
forward
with
the
agility
of
*NL*
a
tiger
,
fell
upon
him
as
on
his
prey
,
and
bore
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whirlwind
of
the
attack
was
,
at
that
moment
,
so
violently
*NL*
concentrated
upon
Enjolras
and
upon
the
door
of
the
wine-shop
,
that
*NL*
no
one
saw
Jean
Valjean
sustaining
the
fainting
Marius
in
his
arms
,
*NL*
traverse
the
unpaved
field
of
the
barricade
and
disappear
behind
the
*NL*
angle
of
the
Corinthe
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
recall
this
angle
which
formed
a
sort
of
cape
on
the
*NL*
street
;
it
afforded
shelter
from
the
bullets
,
the
grape-shot
,
and
all
*NL*
eyes
,
and
a
few
square
feet
of
space
.
There
is
sometimes
a
chamber
*NL*
which
does
not
burn
in
the
midst
of
a
conflagration
,
and
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
raging
seas
,
beyond
a
promontory
or
at
the
extremity
of
a
blind
alley
*NL*
of
shoals
,
a
tranquil
nook
.
It
was
in
this
sort
of
fold
in
the
interior
*NL*
trapezium
of
the
barricade
,
that
Eponine
had
breathed
her
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
Jean
Valjean
halted
,
let
Marius
slide
to
the
ground
,
placed
his
*NL*
back
against
the
wall
,
and
cast
his
eyes
about
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
was
alarming
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
an
instant
,
for
two
or
three
perhaps
,
this
bit
of
wall
was
a
*NL*
shelter
,
but
how
was
he
to
escape
from
this
massacre
?
He
recalled
the
*NL*
anguish
which
he
had
suffered
in
the
Rue
Polonceau
eight
years
before
,
*NL*
and
in
what
manner
he
had
contrived
to
make
his
escape
;
it
was
difficult
*NL*
then
,
to-day
it
was
impossible
.
He
had
before
him
that
deaf
and
*NL*
implacable
house
,
six
stories
in
height
,
which
appeared
to
be
inhabited
*NL*
only
by
a
dead
man
leaning
out
of
his
window
;
he
had
on
his
right
the
*NL*
rather
low
barricade
,
which
shut
off
the
Rue
de
la
Petite
Truanderie
;
*NL*
to
pass
this
obstacle
seemed
easy
,
but
beyond
the
crest
of
the
barrier
a
*NL*
line
of
bayonets
was
visible
.
The
troops
of
the
line
were
posted
on
the
*NL*
watch
behind
that
barricade
.
It
was
evident
,
that
to
pass
the
barricade
*NL*
was
to
go
in
quest
of
the
fire
of
the
platoon
,
and
that
any
head
which
*NL*
should
run
the
risk
of
lifting
itself
above
the
top
of
that
wall
of
*NL*
stones
would
serve
as
a
target
for
sixty
shots
.
On
his
left
he
had
the
*NL*
field
of
battle
.
Death
lurked
round
the
corner
of
that
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
to
be
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
Only
a
bird
could
have
extricated
itself
from
this
predicament
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
it
was
necessary
to
decide
on
the
instant
,
to
devise
some
expedient
,
*NL*
to
come
to
some
decision
.
Fighting
was
going
on
a
few
paces
away
;
*NL*
fortunately
,
all
were
raging
around
a
single
point
,
the
door
of
the
*NL*
wine-shop
;
but
if
it
should
occur
to
one
soldier
,
to
one
single
soldier
,
*NL*
to
turn
the
corner
of
the
house
,
or
to
attack
him
on
the
flank
,
all
was
*NL*
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
gazed
at
the
house
facing
him
,
he
gazed
at
the
barricade
at
*NL*
one
side
of
him
,
then
he
looked
at
the
ground
,
with
the
violence
of
the
*NL*
last
extremity
,
bewildered
,
and
as
though
he
would
have
liked
to
pierce
*NL*
a
hole
there
with
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
dint
of
staring
,
something
vaguely
striking
in
such
an
agony
began
*NL*
to
assume
form
and
outline
at
his
feet
,
as
though
it
had
been
a
power
*NL*
of
glance
which
made
the
thing
desired
unfold
.
A
few
paces
distant
he
*NL*
perceived
,
at
the
base
of
the
small
barrier
so
pitilessly
guarded
and
*NL*
watched
on
the
exterior
,
beneath
a
disordered
mass
of
paving-stones
*NL*
which
partly
concealed
it
,
an
iron
grating
,
placed
flat
and
on
a
level
*NL*
with
the
soil
.
This
grating
,
made
of
stout
,
transverse
bars
,
was
about
*NL*
two
feet
square
.
The
frame
of
paving-stones
which
supported
it
had
been
*NL*
torn
up
,
and
it
was
,
as
it
were
,
unfastened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
bars
a
view
could
be
had
of
a
dark
aperture
,
something
like
*NL*
the
flue
of
a
chimney
,
or
the
pipe
of
a
cistern
.
Jean
Valjean
darted
*NL*
forward
.
His
old
art
of
escape
rose
to
his
brain
like
an
illumination
.
*NL*
To
thrust
aside
the
stones
,
to
raise
the
grating
,
to
lift
Marius
,
who
*NL*
was
as
inert
as
a
dead
body
,
upon
his
shoulders
,
to
descend
,
with
this
*NL*
burden
on
his
loins
,
and
with
the
aid
of
his
elbows
and
knees
into
that
*NL*
sort
of
well
,
fortunately
not
very
deep
,
to
let
the
heavy
trap
,
upon
*NL*
which
the
loosened
stones
rolled
down
afresh
,
fall
into
its
place
behind
*NL*
him
,
to
gain
his
footing
on
a
flagged
surface
three
metres
below
the
*NL*
surface
,
--
all
this
was
executed
like
that
which
one
does
in
dreams
,
with
*NL*
the
strength
of
a
giant
and
the
rapidity
of
an
eagle
;
this
took
only
a
*NL*
few
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
with
Marius
,
who
was
still
unconscious
,
in
a
*NL*
sort
of
long
,
subterranean
corridor
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
reigned
profound
peace
,
absolute
silence
,
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
impression
which
he
had
formerly
experienced
when
falling
from
the
*NL*
wall
into
the
convent
recurred
to
him
.
Only
,
what
he
was
carrying
to-day
*NL*
was
not
Cosette
;
it
was
Marius
.
He
could
barely
hear
the
formidable
*NL*
tumult
in
the
wine-shop
,
taken
by
assault
,
like
a
vague
murmur
overhead
.

?
For
no
*NL*
reason
.
By
means
of
what
organ
?
By
means
of
its
intestine
.
What
is
its
*NL*
intestine
?
The
sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty-five
millions
is
the
most
moderate
approximative
figure
which
the
*NL*
valuations
of
special
science
have
set
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Science
,
after
having
long
groped
about
,
now
knows
that
the
most
*NL*
fecundating
and
the
most
efficacious
of
fertilizers
is
human
manure
.
*NL*
The
Chinese
,
let
us
confess
it
to
our
shame
,
knew
it
before
us
.
Not
*NL*
a
Chinese
peasant
--
it
is
Eckberg
who
says
this
,
--
goes
to
town
without
*NL*
bringing
back
with
him
,
at
the
two
extremities
of
his
bamboo
pole
,
two
*NL*
full
buckets
of
what
we
designate
as
filth
.
Thanks
to
human
dung
,
the
*NL*
earth
in
China
is
still
as
young
as
in
the
days
of
Abraham
.
Chinese
*NL*
wheat
yields
a
hundred
fold
of
the
seed
.
There
is
no
guano
comparable
*NL*
in
fertility
with
the
detritus
of
a
capital
.
A
great
city
is
the
most
*NL*
mighty
of
dung-makers
.
Certain
success
would
attend
the
experiment
*NL*
of
employing
the
city
to
manure
the
plain
.
If
our
gold
is
manure
,
our
*NL*
manure
,
on
the
other
hand
,
is
gold
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
is
done
with
this
golden
manure
?
It
is
swept
into
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fleets
of
vessels
are
despatched
,
at
great
expense
,
to
collect
the
dung
*NL*
of
petrels
and
penguins
at
the
South
Pole
,
and
the
incalculable
element
*NL*
of
opulence
which
we
have
on
hand
,
we
send
to
the
sea
.
All
the
human
and
*NL*
animal
manure
which
the
world
wastes
,
restored
to
the
land
instead
of
*NL*
being
cast
into
the
water
,
would
suffice
to
nourish
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
heaps
of
filth
at
the
gate-posts
,
those
tumbrils
of
mud
which
*NL*
jolt
through
the
street
by
night
,
those
terrible
casks
of
the
street
*NL*
department
,
those
fetid
drippings
of
subterranean
mire
,
which
the
*NL*
pavements
hide
from
you
,
--
do
you
know
what
they
are
?
They
are
the
meadow
*NL*
in
flower
,
the
green
grass
,
wild
thyme
,
thyme
and
sage
,
they
are
game
,
*NL*
they
are
cattle
,
they
are
the
satisfied
bellows
of
great
oxen
in
the
*NL*
evening
,
they
are
perfumed
hay
,
they
are
golden
wheat
,
they
are
the
*NL*
bread
on
your
table
,
they
are
the
warm
blood
in
your
veins
,
they
are
*NL*
health
,
they
are
joy
,
they
are
life
.
This
is
the
will
of
that
mysterious
*NL*
creation
which
is
transformation
on
earth
and
transfiguration
in
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Restore
this
to
the
great
crucible
;
your
abundance
will
flow
forth
from
*NL*
it
.
The
nutrition
of
the
plains
furnishes
the
nourishment
of
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
You
have
it
in
your
power
to
lose
this
wealth
,
and
to
consider
me
*NL*
ridiculous
to
boot
.
This
will
form
the
master-piece
of
your
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Statisticians
have
calculated
that
France
alone
makes
a
deposit
of
*NL*
half
a
milliard
every
year
,
in
the
Atlantic
,
through
the
mouths
of
her
*NL*
rivers
.
Note
this
:
with
five
hundred
millions
we
could
pay
one
quarter
*NL*
of
the
expenses
of
our
budget
.
The
cleverness
of
man
is
such
that
he
*NL*
prefers
to
get
rid
of
these
five
hundred
millions
in
the
gutter
.
It
is
*NL*
the
very
substance
of
the
people
that
is
carried
off
,
here
drop
by
*NL*
drop
,
there
wave
after
wave
,
the
wretched
outpour
of
our
sewers
into
the
*NL*
rivers
,
and
the
gigantic
collection
of
our
rivers
into
the
ocean
.
Every
*NL*
hiccough
of
our
sewers
costs
us
a
thousand
francs
.
From
this
spring
two
*NL*
results
,
the
land
impoverished
,
and
the
water
tainted
.
Hunger
arising
*NL*
from
the
furrow
,
and
disease
from
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
notorious
,
for
example
,
that
at
the
present
hour
,
the
Thames
is
*NL*
poisoning
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
as
Paris
is
concerned
,
it
has
become
indispensable
of
late
,
to
*NL*
transport
the
mouths
of
the
sewers
down
stream
,
below
the
last
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
double
tubular
apparatus
,
provided
with
valves
and
sluices
,
sucking
up
*NL*
and
driving
back
,
a
system
of
elementary
drainage
,
simple
as
the
lungs
*NL*
of
a
man
,
and
which
is
already
in
full
working
order
in
many
communities
*NL*
in
England
,
would
suffice
to
conduct
the
pure
water
of
the
fields
into
*NL*
our
cities
,
and
to
send
back
to
the
fields
the
rich
water
of
the
cities
,
*NL*
and
this
easy
exchange
,
the
simplest
in
the
world
,
would
retain
among
us
*NL*
the
five
hundred
millions
now
thrown
away
.
People
are
thinking
of
other
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
process
actually
in
use
does
evil
,
with
the
intention
of
doing
good
.
*NL*
The
intention
is
good
,
the
result
is
melancholy
.
Thinking
to
purge
the
*NL*
city
,
the
population
is
blanched
like
plants
raised
in
cellars
.
A
sewer
*NL*
is
a
mistake
.
When
drainage
,
everywhere
,
with
its
double
function
,
*NL*
restoring
what
it
takes
,
shall
have
replaced
the
sewer
,
which
is
a
*NL*
simple
impoverishing
washing
,
then
,
this
being
combined
with
the
data
*NL*
of
a
now
social
economy
,
the
product
of
the
earth
will
be
increased
*NL*
tenfold
,
and
the
problem
of
misery
will
be
singularly
lightened
.
Add
the
*NL*
suppression
of
parasitism
,
and
it
will
be
solved
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
the
public
wealth
flows
away
to
the
river
,
and
leakage
*NL*
takes
place
.
Leakage
is
the
word
.
Europe
is
being
ruined
in
this
manner
*NL*
by
exhaustion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
France
,
we
have
just
cited
its
figures
.
Now
,
Paris
contains
one
*NL*
twenty-fifth
of
the
total
population
of
France
,
and
Parisian
guano
being
*NL*
the
richest
of
all
,
we
understate
the
truth
when
we
value
the
loss
on
*NL*
the
part
of
Paris
at
twenty-five
millions
in
the
half
milliard
which
*NL*
France
annually
rejects
.
These
twenty-five
millions
,
employed
in
*NL*
assistance
and
enjoyment
,
would
double
the
splendor
of
Paris
.
The
*NL*
city
spends
them
in
sewers
.
So
that
we
may
say
that
Paris
's
great
*NL*
prodigality
,
its
wonderful
festival
,
its
Beaujon
folly
,
its
orgy
,
its
*NL*
stream
of
gold
from
full
hands
,
its
pomp
,
its
luxury
,
its
magnificence
,
*NL*
is
its
sewer
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
in
this
manner
that
,
in
the
blindness
of
a
poor
political
economy
,
*NL*
we
drown
and
allow
to
float
down
stream
and
to
be
lost
in
the
gulfs
the
*NL*
well-being
of
all
.
There
should
be
nets
at
Saint-Cloud
for
the
public
*NL*
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
Economically
considered
,
the
matter
can
be
summed
up
thus
:
Paris
is
*NL*
a
spendthrift
.
Paris
,
that
model
city
,
that
patron
of
well-arranged
*NL*
capitals
,
of
which
every
nation
strives
to
possess
a
copy
,
that
*NL*
metropolis
of
the
ideal
,
that
august
country
of
the
initiative
,
of
*NL*
impulse
and
of
effort
,
that
centre
and
that
dwelling
of
minds
,
that
*NL*
nation-city
,
that
hive
of
the
future
,
that
marvellous
combination
of
*NL*
Babylon
and
Corinth
,
would
make
a
peasant
of
the
Fo-Kian
shrug
his
*NL*
shoulders
,
from
the
point
of
view
which
we
have
just
indicated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Imitate
Paris
and
you
will
ruin
yourselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
and
particularly
in
this
immemorial
and
senseless
waste
,
Paris
*NL*
is
itself
an
imitator
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
surprising
exhibitions
of
stupidity
are
not
novel
;
this
is
no
*NL*
young
folly
.
The
ancients
did
like
the
moderns
.
``
The
sewers
of
Rome
,
''
*NL*
says
Liebig
,
``
have
absorbed
all
the
well-being
of
the
Roman
peasant
.
''
*NL*
When
the
Campagna
of
Rome
was
ruined
by
the
Roman
sewer
,
Rome
exhausted
*NL*
Italy
,
and
when
she
had
put
Italy
in
her
sewer
,
she
poured
in
Sicily
,
*NL*
then
Sardinia
,
then
Africa
.
The
sewer
of
Rome
has
engulfed
the
world
.
*NL*
This
cess-pool
offered
its
engulfment
to
the
city
and
the
universe
.
Urbi
*NL*
et
orbi
.
Eternal
city
,
unfathomable
sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rome
sets
the
example
for
these
things
as
well
as
for
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
follows
this
example
with
all
the
stupidity
peculiar
to
*NL*
intelligent
towns
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
requirements
of
the
operation
upon
the
subject
of
which
we
have
*NL*
just
explained
our
views
,
Paris
has
beneath
it
another
Paris
;
a
Paris
*NL*
of
sewers
;
which
has
its
streets
,
its
cross-roads
,
its
squares
,
its
*NL*
blind-alleys
,
its
arteries
,
and
its
circulation
,
which
is
of
mire
and
*NL*
minus
the
human
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
nothing
must
be
flattered
,
not
even
a
great
people
;
where
there
*NL*
is
everything
there
is
also
ignominy
by
the
side
of
sublimity
;
and
,
*NL*
if
Paris
contains
Athens
,
the
city
of
light
,
Tyre
,
the
city
of
might
,
*NL*
Sparta
,
the
city
of
virtue
,
Nineveh
,
the
city
of
marvels
,
it
also
*NL*
contains
Lutetia
,
the
city
of
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
the
stamp
of
its
power
is
there
also
,
and
the
Titanic
sink
of
*NL*
Paris
realizes
,
among
monuments
,
that
strange
ideal
realized
in
humanity
*NL*
by
some
men
like
Macchiavelli
,
Bacon
and
Mirabeau
,
grandiose
vileness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sub-soil
of
Paris
,
if
the
eye
could
penetrate
its
surface
,
would
*NL*
present
the
aspect
of
a
colossal
madrepore
.
A
sponge
has
no
more
*NL*
partitions
and
ducts
than
the
mound
of
earth
for
a
circuit
of
six
*NL*
leagues
round
about
,
on
which
rests
the
great
and
ancient
city
.
Not
to
*NL*
mention
its
catacombs
,
which
are
a
separate
cellar
,
not
to
mention
*NL*
the
inextricable
trellis-work
of
gas
pipes
,
without
reckoning
the
vast
*NL*
tubular
system
for
the
distribution
of
fresh
water
which
ends
in
the
*NL*
pillar
fountains
,
the
sewers
alone
form
a
tremendous
,
shadowy
net-work
*NL*
under
the
two
banks
;
a
labyrinth
which
has
its
slope
for
its
guiding
*NL*
thread
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
appears
,
in
the
humid
mist
,
the
rat
which
seems
the
product
to
*NL*
which
Paris
has
given
birth
.

CHAPTER
II
--
ANCIENT
HISTORY
OF
THE
SEWER
*NL*
*NL*
Let
the
reader
imagine
Paris
lifted
off
like
a
cover
,
the
subterranean
*NL*
net-work
of
sewers
,
from
a
bird
's
eye
view
,
will
outline
on
the
banks
*NL*
a
species
of
large
branch
grafted
on
the
river
.
On
the
right
bank
,
the
*NL*
belt
sewer
will
form
the
trunk
of
this
branch
,
the
secondary
ducts
will
*NL*
form
the
branches
,
and
those
without
exit
the
twigs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
figure
is
but
a
summary
one
and
half
exact
,
the
right
angle
,
which
*NL*
is
the
customary
angle
of
this
species
of
subterranean
ramifications
,
*NL*
being
very
rare
in
vegetation
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
more
accurate
image
of
this
strange
geometrical
plan
can
be
formed
*NL*
by
supposing
that
one
is
viewing
some
eccentric
oriental
alphabet
,
*NL*
as
intricate
as
a
thicket
,
against
a
background
of
shadows
,
and
the
*NL*
misshapen
letters
should
be
welded
one
to
another
in
apparent
confusion
,
*NL*
and
as
at
haphazard
,
now
by
their
angles
,
again
by
their
extremities
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sinks
and
sewers
played
a
great
part
in
the
Middle
Ages
,
in
the
Lower
*NL*
Empire
and
in
the
Orient
of
old
.
The
masses
regarded
these
beds
of
*NL*
decomposition
,
these
monstrous
cradles
of
death
,
with
a
fear
that
was
*NL*
almost
religious
.
The
vermin
ditch
of
Benares
is
no
less
conducive
to
*NL*
giddiness
than
the
lions
'
ditch
of
Babylon
.
Teglath-Phalasar
,
according
*NL*
to
the
rabbinical
books
,
swore
by
the
sink
of
Nineveh
.
It
was
from
the
*NL*
sewer
of
Munster
that
John
of
Leyden
produced
his
false
moon
,
and
it
*NL*
was
from
the
cess-pool
of
Kekscheb
that
oriental
menalchme
,
Mokanna
,
the
*NL*
veiled
prophet
of
Khorassan
,
caused
his
false
sun
to
emerge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
of
men
is
reflected
in
the
history
of
sewers
.
The
*NL*
Germoniae
-LSB-
58
-RSB-
narrated
Rome
.
The
sewer
of
Paris
has
been
an
ancient
and
*NL*
formidable
thing
.
It
has
been
a
sepulchre
,
it
has
served
as
an
asylum
.
*NL*
Crime
,
intelligence
,
social
protest
,
liberty
of
conscience
,
thought
,
*NL*
theft
,
all
that
human
laws
persecute
or
have
persecuted
,
is
hidden
in
*NL*
that
hole
;
the
maillotins
in
the
fourteenth
century
,
the
tire-laine
of
*NL*
the
fifteenth
,
the
Huguenots
in
the
sixteenth
,
Morin
's
illuminated
in
*NL*
the
seventeenth
,
the
chauffeurs
-LSB-
brigands
-RSB-
in
the
eighteenth
.
A
*NL*
hundred
years
ago
,
the
nocturnal
blow
of
the
dagger
emerged
thence
,
the
*NL*
pickpocket
in
danger
slipped
thither
;
the
forest
had
its
cave
,
Paris
had
*NL*
its
sewer
.
Vagrancy
,
that
Gallic
picareria
,
accepted
the
sewer
as
the
*NL*
adjunct
of
the
Cour
des
Miracles
,
and
at
evening
,
it
returned
thither
,
*NL*
fierce
and
sly
,
through
the
Maubuee
outlet
,
as
into
a
bed-chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
natural
,
that
those
who
had
the
blind-alley
Vide-Gousset
,
*NL*
-LSB-
Empty-Pocket
-RSB-
or
the
Rue
Coupe-Gorge
-LSB-
Cut-Throat
-RSB-
,
for
the
scene
of
*NL*
their
daily
labor
,
should
have
for
their
domicile
by
night
the
culvert
*NL*
of
the
Chemin-Vert
,
or
the
catch
basin
of
Hurepoix
.
Hence
a
throng
of
*NL*
souvenirs
.
All
sorts
of
phantoms
haunt
these
long
,
solitary
*NL*
corridors
;
everywhere
is
putrescence
and
miasma
;
here
and
there
are
*NL*
breathing-holes
,
where
Villon
within
converses
with
Rabelais
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sewer
in
ancient
Paris
is
the
rendezvous
of
all
exhaustions
and
*NL*
of
all
attempts
.
Political
economy
therein
spies
a
detritus
,
social
*NL*
philosophy
there
beholds
a

*NL*
The
sewer
is
the
conscience
of
the
city
.
Everything
there
converges
*NL*
and
confronts
everything
else
.
In
that
livid
spot
there
are
shades
,
but
*NL*
there
are
no
longer
any
secrets
.
Each
thing
bears
its
true
form
,
or
at
*NL*
least
,
its
definitive
form
.
The
mass
of
filth
has
this
in
its
favor
,
*NL*
that
it
is
not
a
liar
.
Ingenuousness
has
taken
refuge
there
.
The
mask
*NL*
of
Basil
is
to
be
found
there
,
but
one
beholds
its
cardboard
and
its
*NL*
strings
and
the
inside
as
well
as
the
outside
,
and
it
is
accentuated
*NL*
by
honest
mud
.
Scapin
's
false
nose
is
its
next-door
neighbor
.
All
the
*NL*
uncleannesses
of
civilization
,
once
past
their
use
,
fall
into
this
*NL*
trench
of
truth
,
where
the
immense
social
sliding
ends
.
They
are
*NL*
there
engulfed
,
but
they
display
themselves
there
.
This
mixture
is
a
*NL*
confession
.
There
,
no
more
false
appearances
,
no
plastering
over
is
*NL*
possible
,
filth
removes
its
shirt
,
absolute
denudation
puts
to
the
rout
*NL*
all
illusions
and
mirages
,
there
is
nothing
more
except
what
really
*NL*
exists
,
presenting
the
sinister
form
of
that
which
is
coming
to
an
end
.
*NL*
There
,
the
bottom
of
a
bottle
indicates
drunkenness
,
a
basket-handle
*NL*
tells
a
tale
of
domesticity
;
there
the
core
of
an
apple
which
has
*NL*
entertained
literary
opinions
becomes
an
apple-core
once
more
;
the
*NL*
effigy
on
the
big
sou
becomes
frankly
covered
with
verdigris
,
Caiphas
'
*NL*
spittle
meets
Falstaff
's
puking
,
the
louis-d'or
which
comes
from
*NL*
the
gaming-house
jostles
the
nail
whence
hangs
the
rope
's
end
of
the
*NL*
suicide
.
A
livid
foetus
rolls
along
,
enveloped
in
the
spangles
which
*NL*
danced
at
the
Opera
last
Shrove-Tuesday
,
a
cap
which
has
pronounced
*NL*
judgment
on
men
wallows
beside
a
mass
of
rottenness
which
was
formerly
*NL*
Margoton
's
petticoat
;
it
is
more
than
fraternization
,
it
is
equivalent
*NL*
to
addressing
each
other
as
thou
.
All
which
was
formerly
rouged
,
is
*NL*
washed
free
.
The
last
veil
is
torn
away
.
A
sewer
is
a
cynic
.
It
tells
*NL*
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sincerity
of
foulness
pleases
us
,
and
rests
the
soul
.
When
one
has
*NL*
passed
one
's
time
in
enduring
upon
earth
the
spectacle
of
the
great
airs
*NL*
which
reasons
of
state
,
the
oath
,
political
sagacity
,
human
justice
,
*NL*
professional
probity
,
the
austerities
of
situation
,
incorruptible
robes
*NL*
all
assume
,
it
solaces
one
to
enter
a
sewer
and
to
behold
the
mire
which
*NL*
befits
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
instructive
at
the
same
time
.
We
have
just
said
that
history
*NL*
passes
through
the
sewer
.
The
Saint-Barthelemys
filter
through
there
,
*NL*
drop
by
drop
,
between
the
paving-stones
.
Great
public
assassinations
,
*NL*
political
and
religious
butcheries
,
traverse
this
underground
passage
*NL*
of
civilization
,
and
thrust
their
corpses
there
.
For
the
eye
of
the
*NL*
thinker
,
all
historic
murderers
are
to
be
found
there
,
in
that
hideous
*NL*
penumbra
,
on
their
knees
,
with
a
scrap
of
their
winding-sheet
for
*NL*
an
apron
,
dismally
sponging
out
their
work

Louis

Beneath

hears
the

One
there
breathes
the
enormous
fetidness
*NL*
of
social

One
beholds
reddish

There

*NL*
The

should
enter
these
shadows

They
form
a
part
of

his
laboratory

Philosophy
is
the
microscope
of
the
thought
.
Everything

desires
to
flee
from
it

nothing
escapes
it

Tergiversation
is
*NL*
useless
.
What
side
of
oneself
does
one
display
in
evasions
?
the
shameful
*NL*
side
.
Philosophy
pursues
with
its
glance
,
probes
the
evil
,
and
does
*NL*
not
permit
it
to
escape
into
nothingness
.
In
the
obliteration
of
things
*NL*
which
disappear
,
in
the
watching
of
things

vanish
,
it
recognizes

all
.
It
reconstructs

from
the
rag
,
and
the
woman
from
the
*NL*
scrap
of
her
dress
.
From
the
cess-pool

it
re-constitutes
the
city

from

mud
,
it
reconstructs
manners
;
from

it
infers
the
amphora

or
the

.
By
the
imprint
of

it
*NL*
recognizes
the
difference
which
separates
the
Jewry
of

Judengasse
*NL*
from
the
Jewry
of

.
It
re-discovers
in

remains

CHAPTER
III
--
BRUNESEAU
*NL*
*NL*
The
sewer
of
Paris
in
the
Middle
Ages
was
legendary
.
In
the
sixteenth
*NL*
century
,
Henri
II
.
attempted
a
bore
,
which
failed
.
Not
a
hundred
years
*NL*
ago
,
the
cess-pool
,
Mercier
attests
the
fact
,
was
abandoned
to
itself
,
*NL*
and
fared
as
best
it
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
this
ancient
Paris
,
delivered
over
to
quarrels
,
to
indecision
,
*NL*
and
to
gropings
.
It
was
tolerably
stupid
for
a
long
time
.
Later
on
,
'89
*NL*
showed
how
understanding
comes
to
cities
.
But
in
the
good
,
old
times
,
*NL*
the
capital
had
not
much
head
.
It
did
not
know
how
to
manage
its
own
*NL*
affairs
either
morally
or
materially
,
and
could
not
sweep
out
filth
*NL*
any
better
than
it
could
abuses
.
Everything
presented
an
obstacle
,
*NL*
everything
raised
a
question
.
The
sewer
,
for
example
,
was
refractory
to
*NL*
every
itinerary
.
One
could
no
more
find
one
's
bearings
in
the
sewer
*NL*
than
one
could
understand
one
's
position
in
the
city
;
above
the
*NL*
unintelligible
,
below
the
inextricable
;
beneath
the
confusion
of
tongues
*NL*
there
reigned
the
confusion
of
caverns
;
Daedalus
backed
up
Babel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
the
Paris
sewer
took
a
notion
to
overflow
,
as
though
this
*NL*
misunderstood
Nile
were
suddenly
seized
with
a
fit
of
rage
.
There
*NL*
occurred
,
infamous
to
relate
,
inundations
of
the
sewer
.
At
times
,
that
*NL*
stomach
of
civilization
digested
badly
,
the
cess-pool
flowed
back
into
*NL*
the
throat
of
the
city
,
and
Paris
got
an
after-taste
of
her
own
filth
.
*NL*
These
resemblances
of
the
sewer
to
remorse
had
their
good
points
;
they
*NL*
were
warnings
;
very
badly
accepted
,
however
;
the
city
waxed
indignant
*NL*
at
the
audacity
of
its
mire
,
and
did
not
admit
that
the
filth
should
*NL*
return
.
Drive
it
out
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inundation
of
1802
is
one
of
the
actual
memories
of
Parisians
of
*NL*
the
age
of
eighty
.
The
mud
spread
in
cross-form
over
the
Place
des
*NL*
Victoires
,
where
stands
the
statue
of
Louis
XIV.
;
it
entered
the
Rue
*NL*
Saint-Honore
by
the
two
mouths
to
the
sewer
in
the
Champs-Elysees
,
*NL*
the
Rue
Saint-Florentin
through
the
Saint-Florentin
sewer
,
the
Rue
*NL*
Pierre-a-Poisson
through
the
sewer
de
la
Sonnerie
,
the
Rue
Popincourt
,
*NL*
through
the
sewer
of
the
Chemin-Vert
,
the
Rue
de
la
Roquette
,
through
*NL*
the
sewer
of
the
Rue
de
Lappe
;
it
covered
the
drain
of
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Champs-Elysees
to
the
height
of
thirty-five
centimetres
;
and
,
to
the
*NL*
South
,
through
the
vent
of
the
Seine
,
performing
its
functions
in
*NL*
inverse
sense
,
it
penetrated
the
Rue
Mazarine
,
the
Rue
de
l'Echaude
,
and
*NL*
the
Rue
des
Marais
,
where
it
stopped
at
a
distance
of
one
hundred
and
*NL*
nine
metres
,
a
few
paces
distant
from
the
house
in
which
Racine
had
*NL*
lived
,
respecting
,
in
the
seventeenth
century
,
the
poet
more
than
the
*NL*
King
.
It
attained
its
maximum
depth
in
the
Rue
Saint-Pierre
,
where
*NL*
it
rose
to
the
height
of
three
feet
above
the
flag-stones
of
the
*NL*
water-spout
,
and
its
maximum
length
in
the
Rue
Saint-Sabin
,
where
it
*NL*
spread
out
over
a
stretch
two
hundred
and
thirty-eight
metres
in
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
beginning
of
this
century
,
the
sewer
of
Paris
was
still
a
*NL*
mysterious
place
.
Mud
can
never
enjoy
a
good
fame
;
but
in
this
case
its
*NL*
evil
renown
reached
the
verge
of
the
terrible
.
Paris
knew
,
in
a
confused
*NL*
way
,
that
she
had
under
her
a
terrible
cavern
.
People
talked
of
it
as
*NL*
of
that
monstrous
bed
of
Thebes
in
which
swarmed
centipedes
fifteen
long
*NL*
feet
in
length
,
and
which
might
have
served
Behemoth
for
a
bathtub
.
*NL*
The
great
boots
of
the
sewermen
never
ventured
further
than
certain
*NL*
well-known
points
.
We
were
then
very
near
the
epoch
when
the
scavenger
's
*NL*
carts
,
from
the
summit
of
which
Sainte-Foix
fraternized
with
the
Marquis
*NL*
de
Crequi
,
discharged
their
loads
directly
into
the
sewer
.
As
for
*NL*
cleaning
out
,
--
that
function
was
entrusted
to
the
pouring
rains
which
*NL*
encumbered
rather
than
swept
away
.
Rome
left
some
poetry
to
her
sewer
,
*NL*
and
called
it
the
Gemoniae
;
Paris
insulted
hers
,
and
entitled
it
the
*NL*
Polypus-Hole
.
Science
and
superstition
were
in
accord
,
in
horror
.
The
*NL*
Polypus
hole
was
no
less
repugnant
to
hygiene
than
to
legend
.
The
goblin
*NL*
was
developed
under
the
fetid
covering
of
the
Mouffetard
sewer
;
the
*NL*
corpses
of
the
Marmousets
had
been
cast
into
the
sewer
de
la
Barillerie
;
*NL*
Fagon
attributed
the
redoubtable
malignant
fever
of
1685
to
the
great
*NL*
hiatus
of
the
sewer
of
the
Marais
,
which
remained
yawning
until
1833
in
*NL*
the
Rue
Saint-Louis
,
almost
opposite
the
sign
of
the
Gallant
Messenger
.
*NL*
The
mouth
of
the
sewer
of
the
Rue
de
la
Mortellerie
was
celebrated
for
*NL*
the
pestilences
which
had
their
source
there
;
with
its
grating
of
iron
,
*NL*
with
points
simulating
a
row
of
teeth
,
it
was
like
a
dragon
's
maw
*NL*
in
that
fatal
street
,
breathing
forth
hell
upon
men
.
The
popular
*NL*
imagination
seasoned
the
sombre
Parisian
sink
with
some
indescribably
*NL*
hideous
intermixture
of
the
infinite
.
The
sewer
had
no
bottom
.
The
sewer
*NL*
was
the
lower
world
.
The
idea
of
exploring
these
leprous
regions
did
not
*NL*
even
occur
to
the
police
.
To
try
that
unknown
thing
,
to
cast
the
plummet
*NL*
into
that
shadow
,
to
set
out
on
a
voyage
of
discovery
in
that
abyss
--
who
*NL*
would
have
dared
?
It
was
alarming
.
Nevertheless
,
some
one
did
present
*NL*
himself
.
The
cess-pool
had
its
Christopher
Columbus
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
in
1805
,
during
one
of
the
rare
apparitions
which
the
Emperor
*NL*
made
in
Paris
,
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
,
some
Decres
or
Cretet
or
*NL*
other
,
came
to
the
master
's
intimate
levee
.
In
the
Carrousel
there
was
*NL*
audible
the
clanking
of
swords
of
all
those
extraordinary
soldiers
of
*NL*
the
great
Republic
,
and
of
the
great
Empire
;
then
Napoleon
's
door
was
*NL*
blocked
with
heroes
;
men
from
the
Rhine
,
from
the
Escaut
,
from
the
*NL*
Adige
,
and
from
the
Nile
;
companions
of
Joubert
,
of
Desaix
,
of
Marceau
,
*NL*
of
Hoche
,
of
Kleber
;
the
aerostiers
of
Fleurus
,
the
grenadiers
of
*NL*
Mayence
,
the
pontoon-builders
of
Genoa
,
hussars
whom
the
Pyramids
had
*NL*
looked
down
upon
,
artillerists
whom
Junot
's
cannon-ball
had
spattered
*NL*
with
mud
,
cuirassiers
who
had
taken
by
assault
the
fleet
lying
at
anchor
*NL*
in
the
Zuyderzee
;
some
had
followed
Bonaparte
upon
the
bridge
of
Lodi
,
*NL*
others
had
accompanied
Murat
in
the
trenches
of
Mantua
,
others
had
*NL*
preceded
Lannes
in
the
hollow
road
of
Montebello
.
The
whole
army
of
that
*NL*
day
was
present
there
,
in
the
court-yard
of
the
Tuileries
,
represented
*NL*
by
a
squadron
or
a
platoon
,
and
guarding
Napoleon
in
repose
;
and
that
*NL*
was
the
splendid
epoch
when
the
grand
army
had
Marengo
behind
it
and
*NL*
Austerlitz
before
it
.
--
``
Sire
,
''
said
the
Minister
of
the
Interior
to
*NL*
Napoleon
,
``
yesterday
I
saw
the
most
intrepid
man
in
your
Empire
.
''
--
``
What
*NL*
man
is
that
?
''
said
the
Emperor
brusquely
,
``
and
what
has
he
done
?
''
--
``
He
*NL*
wants
to
do
something
,
Sire
.
''
--
``
What
is
it
?
''
--
``
To
visit
the
sewers
of
*NL*
Paris
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
existed
and
his
name
was
Bruneseau
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
BRUNESEAU
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
visit
took
place
.
It
was
a
formidable
campaign
;
a
nocturnal
battle
*NL*
against
pestilence
and
suffocation
.
It
was
,
at
the
same
time
,
a
voyage
*NL*
of
discovery
.
One
of
the
survivors
of
this
expedition
,
an
intelligent
*NL*
workingman
,
who
was
very
young
at
the
time
,
related
curious
details
with
*NL*
regard
to
it
,
several
years
ago
,
which
Bruneseau
thought
himself
obliged
*NL*
to
omit
in
his
report
to
the
prefect
of
police
,
as
unworthy
of
official
*NL*
style
.
The
processes
of
disinfection
were
,
at
that
epoch
,
extremely
*NL*
rudimentary
.
Hardly
had
Bruneseau
crossed
the
first
articulations
of
*NL*
that
subterranean
network
,
when
eight
laborers
out
of
the
twenty
refused
*NL*
to
go
any
further
.
The
operation
was
complicated
;
the
visit
entailed
the
*NL*
necessity
of
cleaning
;
hence
it
was
necessary
to
cleanse
and
at
the
same
*NL*
time
,
to
proceed
;
to
note
the
entrances
of
water
,
to
count
the
gratings
*NL*
and
the
vents
,
to
lay
out
in
detail
the
branches
,
to
indicate
the
*NL*
currents
at
the
point
where
they
parted
,
to
define
the
respective
bounds
*NL*
of
the
divers
basins
,
to
sound
the
small
sewers
grafted
on
the
principal
*NL*
sewer
,
to
measure
the
height
under
the
key-stone
of
each
drain
,
and
the
*NL*
width
,
at
the
spring
of
the
vaults
as
well
as
at
the
bottom
,
in
order
*NL*
to
determine
the
arrangements
with
regard
to
the
level
of
each
*NL*
water-entrance
,
either
of
the
bottom
of
the
arch
,
or
on
the
soil
of
the
*NL*
street
.
They
advanced
with
toil
.
The
lanterns
pined
away
in
the
foul
*NL*
atmosphere
.
From
time
to
time
,
a
fainting
sewerman
was
carried
out
.
*NL*
At
certain
points
,
there
were
precipices
.
The
soil
had
given
away
,
the
*NL*
pavement
had
crumbled
,
the
sewer
had
changed
into
a
bottomless
well
;
*NL*
they
found
nothing
solid
;
a
man
disappeared
suddenly
;
they
had
great
*NL*
difficulty
in
getting
him
out
again
.
On
the
advice
of
Fourcroy
,
they
*NL*
lighted
large
cages
filled
with
tow
steeped
in
resin
,
from
time
to
time
,
*NL*
in
spots
which
had
been
sufficiently
disinfected
.
In
some
places
,
the
*NL*
wall
was
covered
with
misshapen
fungi
,
--
one
would
have
said
tumors
;
the
*NL*
very
stone
seemed
diseased
within
this
unbreathable
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bruneseau
,
in
his
exploration
,
proceeded
down
hill
.
At
the
point
of
*NL*
separation
of
the
two
water-conduits
of
the
Grand-Hurleur
,
he
deciphered
*NL*
upon
a
projecting
stone
the
date
of
1550
;
this
stone
indicated
the
*NL*
limits
where
Philibert
Delorme
,
charged
by
Henri
II
.
with
visiting
the
*NL*
subterranean
drains
of
Paris
,
had
halted
.
This
stone
was
the
mark
of
*NL*
the
sixteenth
century
on
the
sewer
;
Bruneseau
found
the
handiwork
of
*NL*
the
seventeenth
century
once
more
in
the
Ponceau
drain
of
the
old
Rue
*NL*
Vielle-du-Temple
,
vaulted
between
1600
and
1650
;
and
the
handiwork
of
*NL*
the
eighteenth
in
the
western
section
of
the
collecting
canal
,
walled
*NL*
and
vaulted
in
1740
.
These
two
vaults
,
especially
the
less
ancient
,
that
*NL*
of
1740
,
were
more
cracked
and
decrepit
than
the
masonry
of
the
belt
*NL*
sewer
,
which
dated
from
1412
,
an
epoch
when
the
brook
of
fresh
water
of
*NL*
Menilmontant
was
elevated
to
the
dignity
of
the
Grand
Sewer
of
Paris
,
an
*NL*
advancement
analogous
to
that
of
a
peasant
who
should
become
first
valet
*NL*
de
chambre
to
the
King
;
something
like
Gros-Jean
transformed
into
Lebel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
and
there
,
particularly
beneath
the
Court-House
,
they
thought
they
*NL*
recognized
the
hollows
of
ancient
dungeons
,
excavated
in
the
very
sewer
*NL*
itself
.
Hideous
place
!
An
iron
neck-collar
was
hanging
in
one
of
these
*NL*
cells
.
They
walled
them
all
up
.
Some
of
their
finds
were
singular
;
among
*NL*
others
,
the
skeleton
of
an
ourang-outan
,
who
had
disappeared
from
the
*NL*
Jardin
des
Plantes
in
1800
,
a
disappearance
probably
connected
with
*NL*
the
famous
and
indisputable
apparition
of
the
devil
in
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Bernardins
,
in
the
last
year
of
the
eighteenth
century
.
The
poor
devil
*NL*
had
ended
by
drowning
himself
in
the
sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beneath
this
long
,
arched
drain
which
terminated
at
the
Arche-Marion
,
*NL*
a
perfectly
preserved
rag-picker
's
basket
excited
the
admiration
of
all
*NL*
connoisseurs
.
Everywhere
,
the
mire
,
which
the
sewermen
came
to
handle
*NL*
with
intrepidity
,
abounded
in
precious
objects
,
jewels
of
gold
and
*NL*
silver
,
precious
stones
,
coins
.
If
a
giant
had
filtered
this
cesspool
,
*NL*
he
would
have
had
the
riches
of
centuries
in
his
lair
.
At
the
point
*NL*
where
the
two
branches
of
the
Rue
du
Temple
and
of
the
Rue
Sainte-Avoye
*NL*
separate
,
they
picked
up
a
singular
Huguenot
medal
in
copper
,
bearing
on
*NL*
one
side
the
pig
hooded
with
a
cardinal
's
hat
,
and
on
the
other
,
a
wolf
*NL*
with
a
tiara
on
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
surprising
encounter
was
at
the
entrance
to
the
Grand
Sewer
.
*NL*
This
entrance
had
formerly
been
closed
by
a
grating
of
which
nothing
but
*NL*
the
hinges
remained
.
From
one
of
these
hinges
hung
a
dirty
and
shapeless
*NL*
rag
which
,
arrested
there
in
its
passage
,
no
doubt
,
had
floated
there
*NL*
in
the
darkness
and
finished
its
process
of
being
torn
apart
.
Bruneseau
*NL*
held
his
lantern
close
to
this
rag
and
examined
it
.
It
was
of
very
fine
*NL*
batiste
,
and
in
one
of
the
corners
,
less
frayed
than
the
rest
,
they
*NL*
made
out
a
heraldic
coronet
and
embroidered
above
these
seven
letters
:
*NL*
LAVBESP
.
The
crown
was
the
coronet
of
a
Marquis
,
and
the
seven
letters
*NL*
signified
Laubespine
.
They
recognized
the
fact
,
that
what
they
had
*NL*
before
their
eyes
was
a
morsel
of
the
shroud
of
Marat
.
Marat
in
his
*NL*
youth
had
had
amorous
intrigues
.
This
was
when
he
was
a
member
of
the
*NL*
household
of
the
Comte
d'Artois
,
in
the
capacity
of
physician
to
the
*NL*
Stables
.
From
these
love
affairs
,
historically
proved
,
with
a
great
*NL*
lady
,
he
had
retained
this
sheet
.
As
a
waif
or
a
souvenir
.
At
his
death
,
*NL*
as
this
was
the
only
linen
of
any
fineness
which
he
had
in
his
house
,
*NL*
they
buried
him
in
it
.
Some
old
women
had
shrouded
him
for
the
tomb
in
*NL*
that
swaddling-band
in
which
the
tragic
Friend
of
the
people
had
enjoyed
*NL*
voluptuousness
.
Bruneseau
passed
on
.
They
left
that
rag
where
it
hung
;
*NL*
they
did
not
put
the
finishing
touch
to
it
.
Did
this
arise
from
scorn
*NL*
or
from
respect
?
Marat
deserved
both
.
And
then
,
destiny
was
there
*NL*
sufficiently
stamped
to
make
them
hesitate
to
touch
it
.
Besides
,
the
*NL*
things
of
the
sepulchre
must
be
left
in
the
spot
which
they
select
.
In
*NL*
short
,
the
relic
was
a
strange
one
.
A
Marquise
had
slept
in
it
;
Marat
*NL*
had
rotted
in
it
;
it
had
traversed
the
Pantheon
to
end
with
the
rats
*NL*
of
the
sewer
.
This
chamber
rag
,
of
which
Watteau
would
formerly
have
*NL*
joyfully
sketched
every
fold
,
had
ended
in
becoming
worthy
of
the
fixed
*NL*
gaze
of
Dante
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
visit
to
the
subterranean
stream
of
filth
of
Paris
lasted
*NL*
seven
years
,
from
1805
to
1812
.
As
he
proceeded
,
Bruneseau
drew
,
*NL*
directed
,
and
completed
considerable
works
;
in
1808
he
lowered
the
arch
*NL*
of
the
Ponceau
,
and
,
everywhere
creating
new
lines
,
he
pushed
the
*NL*
sewer
,
in
1809
,
under
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
as
far
as
the
fountain
of
*NL*
the
Innocents
;
in
1810
,
under
the
Rue
Froidmanteau
and
under
the
*NL*
Salpetriere
;
in
1811
under
the
Rue
Neuve-des-Petits-Peres
,
under
the
Rue
*NL*
du
Mail
,
under
the
Rue
de
l'Echarpe
,
under
the
Place
Royale
;
in
1812
,
*NL*
under
the
Rue
de
la
Paix
,
and
under
the
Chaussee
d'Antin
.
At
the
same
*NL*
time
,
he
had
the
whole
net-work
disinfected
and
rendered
healthful
.
In
*NL*
the
second
year
of
his
work
,
Bruneseau
engaged
the
assistance
of
his
*NL*
son-in-law
Nargaud
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
thus
that
,
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
,
ancient
society
*NL*
cleansed
its
double
bottom
,
and
performed
the
toilet
of
its
sewer
.
There
*NL*
was
that
much
clean
,
at
all
events
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tortuous
,
cracked
,
unpaved
,
full
of
fissures
,
intersected
by
gullies
,
*NL*
jolted
by
eccentric
elbows
,
mounting
and
descending
illogically
,
fetid
,
*NL*
wild
,
fierce
,
submerged
in
obscurity
,
with
cicatrices
on
its
pavements
*NL*
and
scars
on
its
walls
,
terrible
,
--
such
was
,
retrospectively
viewed
,
the
*NL*
antique
sewer
of
Paris
.
Ramifications
in
every
direction
,
crossings
,
*NL*
of
trenches
,
branches
,
goose-feet
,
stars
,
as
in
military
mines
,
coecum
,
*NL*
blind
alleys
,
vaults
lined
with
saltpetre
,
pestiferous
pools
,
scabby
*NL*
sweats
,
on
the
walls
,
drops
dripping
from
the
ceilings
,
darkness
;
*NL*
nothing
could
equal
the
horror
of
this
old
,
waste
crypt
,
the
digestive
*NL*
apparatus
of
Babylon
,
a
cavern
,
ditch
,
gulf
pierced
with
streets
,
a
*NL*
titanic
mole-burrow
,
where
the
mind
seems
to
behold
that
enormous
blind
*NL*
mole
,
the
past
,
prowling
through
the
shadows
,
in
the
filth
which
has
*NL*
been
splendor
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
we
repeat
,
was
the
sewer
of
the
past
.

CHAPTER
V
--
PRESENT
PROGRESS
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
the
sewer
is
clean
,
cold
,
straight
,
correct
.
It
almost
realizes
*NL*
the
ideal
of
what
is
understood
in
England
by
the
word
``
respectable
.
''
It
*NL*
is
proper
and
grayish
;
laid
out
by
rule
and
line
;
one
might
almost
say
*NL*
as
though
it
came
out
of
a
bandbox
.
It
resembles
a
tradesman
who
has
*NL*
become
a
councillor
of
state
.
One
can
almost
see
distinctly
there
.
The
*NL*
mire
there
comports
itself
with
decency
.
At
first
,
one
might
readily
*NL*
mistake
it
for
one
of
those
subterranean
corridors
,
which
were
so
common
*NL*
in
former
days
,
and
so
useful
in
flights
of
monarchs
and
princes
,
in
*NL*
those
good
old
times
,
``
when
the
people
loved
their
kings
.
''
The
present
*NL*
sewer
is
a
beautiful
sewer
;
the
pure
style
reigns
there
;
the
classical
*NL*
rectilinear
alexandrine
which
,
driven
out
of
poetry
,
appears
to
have
*NL*
taken
refuge
in
architecture
,
seems
mingled
with
all
the
stones
of
*NL*
that
long
,
dark
and
whitish
vault
;
each
outlet
is
an
arcade
;
the
Rue
de
*NL*
Rivoli
serves
as
pattern
even
in
the
sewer
.
However
,
if
the
geometrical
*NL*
line
is
in
place
anywhere
,
it
is
certainly
in
the
drainage
trench
of
*NL*
a
great
city
.
There
,
everything
should
be
subordinated
to
the
shortest
*NL*
road
.
The
sewer
has
,
nowadays
,
assumed
a
certain
official
aspect
.
The
*NL*
very
police
reports
,
of
which
it
sometimes
forms
the
subject
,
no
longer
*NL*
are
wanting
in
respect
towards
it
.
The
words
which
characterize
it
in
*NL*
administrative
language
are
sonorous
and
dignified
.
What
used
to
be
*NL*
called
a
gut
is
now
called
a
gallery
;
what
used
to
be
called
a
hole
is
*NL*
now
called
a
surveying
orifice
.
Villon
would
no
longer
meet
with
his
*NL*
ancient
temporary
provisional
lodging
.
This
net-work
of
cellars
has
its
*NL*
immemorial
population
of
prowlers
,
rodents
,
swarming
in
greater
numbers
*NL*
than
ever
;
from
time
to
time
,
an
aged
and
veteran
rat
risks
his
head
at
*NL*
the
window
of
the
sewer
and
surveys
the
Parisians
;
but
even
these
vermin
*NL*
grow
tame
,
so
satisfied
are
they
with
their
subterranean
palace
.
The
*NL*
cesspool
no
longer
retains
anything
of
its
primitive
ferocity
.
The
rain
,
*NL*
which
in
former
days
soiled
the
sewer
,
now
washes
it
.
Nevertheless
,
do
*NL*
not
trust
yourself
too
much
to
it
.
Miasmas
still
inhabit
it
.
It
is
*NL*
more
hypocritical
than
irreproachable
.
The
prefecture
of
police
and
*NL*
the
commission
of
health
have
done
their
best
.
But
,
in
spite
of
all
the
*NL*
processes
of
disinfection
,
it
exhales
,
a
vague
,
suspicious
odor
like
*NL*
Tartuffe
after
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
confess
,
that
,
taking
it
all
in
all
,
this
sweeping
is
a
homage
*NL*
which
the
sewer
pays
to
civilization
,
and
as
,
from
this
point
of
view
,
*NL*
Tartuffe
's
conscience
is
a
progress
over
the
Augean
stables
,
it
is
*NL*
certain
that
the
sewers
of
Paris
have
been
improved
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
more
than
progress
;
it
is
transmutation
.
Between
the
ancient
*NL*
and
the
present
sewer
there
is
a
revolution
.
What
has
effected
this
*NL*
revolution
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
whom
all
the
world
forgets
,
and
whom
we
have
mentioned
,

Bruneseau

CHAPTER
VI
--
FUTURE
PROGRESS
*NL*
*NL*
The
excavation
of
the
sewer
of
Paris
has
been
no
slight
task
.
The
last
*NL*
ten
centuries
have
toiled
at
it
without
being
able
to
bring
it
to
a
*NL*
termination
,
any
more
than
they
have
been
able
to
finish
Paris
.
The
*NL*
sewer
,
in
fact
,
receives
all
the
counter-shocks
of
the
growth
of
Paris
.
*NL*
Within
the
bosom
of
the
earth
,
it
is
a
sort
of
mysterious
polyp
with
a
*NL*
thousand
antennae
,
which
expands
below
as
the
city
expands
above
.
Every
*NL*
time
that
the
city
cuts
a
street
,
the
sewer
stretches
out
an
arm
.
The
*NL*
old
monarchy
had
constructed
only
twenty-three
thousand
three
hundred
*NL*
metres
of
sewers
;
that
was
where
Paris
stood
in
this
respect
on
the
*NL*
first
of
January
,
1806
.
Beginning
with
this
epoch
,
of
which
we
shall
*NL*
shortly
speak
,
the
work
was
usefully
and
energetically
resumed
and
*NL*
prosecuted
;
Napoleon
built
--
the
figures
are
curious
--
four
thousand
eight
*NL*
hundred
and
four
metres
;
Louis
XVIII.
,
five
thousand
seven
hundred
*NL*
and
nine
;
Charles
X.
,
ten
thousand
eight
hundred
and
thirty-six
;
*NL*
Louis-Philippe
,
eighty-nine
thousand
and
twenty
;
the
Republic
of
*NL*
1848
,
twenty-three
thousand
three
hundred
and
eighty-one
;
the
present
*NL*
government
,
seventy
thousand
five
hundred
;
in
all
,
at
the
present
time
,
*NL*
two
hundred
and
twenty-six
thousand
six
hundred
and
ten
metres
;
*NL*
sixty
leagues
of
sewers
;
the
enormous
entrails
of
Paris
.
An
obscure
*NL*
ramification
ever
at
work
;
a
construction
which
is
immense
and
ignored
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
reader
sees
,
the
subterranean
labyrinth
of
Paris
is
to-day
*NL*
more
than
ten
times
what
it
was
at
the
beginning
of
the
century
.
It
is
*NL*
difficult
to
form
any
idea
of
all
the
perseverance
and
the
efforts
which
*NL*
have
been
required
to
bring
this
cess-pool
to
the
point
of
relative
*NL*
perfection
in
which
it
now
is
.
It
was
with
great
difficulty
that
the
*NL*
ancient
monarchical
provostship
and
,
during
the
last
ten
years
of
*NL*
the
eighteenth
century
,
the
revolutionary
mayoralty
,
had
succeeded
in
*NL*
perforating
the
five
leagues
of
sewer
which
existed
previous
to
1806
.
*NL*
All
sorts
of
obstacles
hindered
this
operation
,
some
peculiar
to
the
*NL*
soil
,
others
inherent
in
the
very
prejudices
of
the
laborious
population
*NL*
of
Paris
.
Paris
is
built
upon
a
soil
which
is
singularly
rebellious
to
*NL*
the
pick
,
the
hoe
,
the
bore
,
and
to
human
manipulation
.
There
is
nothing
*NL*
more
difficult
to
pierce
and
to
penetrate
than
the
geological
formation
*NL*
upon
which
is
superposed
the
marvellous
historical
formation
called
*NL*
Paris
;
as
soon
as
work
in
any
form
whatsoever
is
begun
and
adventures
*NL*
upon
this
stretch
of
alluvium
,
subterranean
resistances
abound
.
There
*NL*
are
liquid
clays
,
springs
,
hard
rocks
,
and
those
soft
and
deep
quagmires
*NL*
which
special
science
calls
moutardes
.

The
pick
advances
laboriously
*NL*
through
the
calcareous
layers
alternating
with
very
slender
threads
of
*NL*
clay
,
and
schistose
beds
in
plates
incrusted
with
oyster-shells
,
the
*NL*
contemporaries
of
the
pre-Adamite
oceans
.
Sometimes
a
rivulet
suddenly
*NL*
bursts
through
a
vault
that
has
been
begun
,
and
inundates
the
laborers
;
*NL*
or
a
layer
of
marl
is
laid
bare
,
and
rolls
down
with
the
fury
of
a
*NL*
cataract
,
breaking
the
stoutest
supporting
beams
like
glass
.
Quite
*NL*
recently
,
at
Villette
,
when
it
became
necessary
to
pass
the
collecting
*NL*
sewer
under
the
Saint-Martin
canal
without
interrupting
navigation
or
*NL*
emptying
the
canal
,
a
fissure
appeared
in
the
basin
of
the
canal
,
water
*NL*
suddenly
became
abundant
in
the
subterranean
tunnel
,
which
was
beyond
*NL*
the
power
of
the
pumping
engines
;
it
was
necessary
to
send
a
diver
to
*NL*
explore
the
fissure
which
had
been
made
in
the
narrow
entrance
of
the
*NL*
grand
basin
,
and
it
was
not
without
great
difficulty
that
it
was
stopped
*NL*
up
.
Elsewhere
near
the
Seine
,
and
even
at
a
considerable
distance
*NL*
from
the
river
,
as
for
instance
,
at
Belleville
,
Grand-Rue
and
Lumiere
*NL*
Passage
,
quicksands
are
encountered
in
which
one
sticks
fast
,
and
in
*NL*
which
a
man
sinks
visibly
.
Add
suffocation
by
miasmas
,
burial
by
slides
,
*NL*
and
sudden
crumbling
of
the
earth
.
Add
the
typhus
,
with
which
the
*NL*
workmen
become
slowly
impregnated
.
In
our
own
day
,
after
having
*NL*
excavated
the
gallery
of
Clichy
,
with
a
banquette
to
receive
the
*NL*
principal
water-conduit
of
Ourcq
,
a
piece
of
work
which
was
executed
in
*NL*
a

ten

deep

the

of
land-slides
,
and
*NL*
with
the
aid
of
excavations
often
putrid
,
and
of

vaulted
*NL*
the
Bievre
from
the
Boulevard
de

,
as
far
as
the
Seine
;
after
*NL*
having
,
in
order
to
deliver
Paris
from
the
floods
of
Montmartre
and
in
*NL*
order
to
provide
an
outlet
for
that
river-like
pool
nine
hectares
in
*NL*
extent
,
which
crouched
near
the
Barriere
des
Martyrs
,
after
having
,
let
*NL*
us
state
,
constructed
the
line
of
sewers
from
the
Barriere
Blanche
to
*NL*
the
road
of
Aubervilliers
,
in
four
months
,
working
day
and
night
,
at
a
*NL*
depth
of
eleven
metres
;
after
having
--
a
thing
heretofore
unseen
--
made
a
*NL*
subterranean
sewer
in
the
Rue
Barre-du-Bec
,
without
a
trench
,
six
*NL*
metres
below
the
surface
,
the
superintendent
,
Monnot
,
died
.
After
having
*NL*
vaulted
three
thousand
metres
of
sewer
in
all
quarters
of
the
city
,
from
*NL*
the
Rue
Traversiere-Saint-Antoine
to
the
Rue
de
l'Ourcine
,
after
having
*NL*
freed
the
Carrefour
Censier-Mouffetard
from
inundations
of
rain
by
means
*NL*
of
the
branch
of
the
Arbalete
,
after
having
built
the
Saint-Georges
*NL*
sewer
,
on
rock
and
concrete
in
the
fluid
sands
,
after
having
directed
*NL*
the
formidable
lowering
of
the
flooring
of
the
vault
timber
in
the
*NL*
Notre-Dame-de-Nazareth
branch
,
Duleau
the
engineer
died
.
There
are
no
*NL*
bulletins
for
such
acts
of
bravery
as
these
,
which
are
more
useful
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
than
the
brutal
slaughter
of
the
field
of
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sewers
of
Paris
in
1832
were
far
from
being
what
they
are
to-day
.
*NL*
Bruneseau
had
given
the
impulse
,
but
the
cholera
was
required
to
*NL*
bring
about
the
vast
reconstruction
which
took
place
later
on
.
It
is
*NL*
surprising
to
say
,
for
example
,
that
in
1821
,
a
part
of
the
belt
sewer
,
*NL*
called
the
Grand
Canal
,
as
in
Venice
,
still
stood
stagnating
uncovered
*NL*
to
the
sky
,
in
the
Rue
des
Gourdes
.
It
was
only
in
1821
that
the
city
*NL*
of
Paris
found
in
its
pocket
the
two
hundred
and
sixty-thousand
eighty
*NL*
francs
and
six
centimes
required
for
covering
this
mass
of
filth
.
The
*NL*
three
absorbing
wells
,
of
the
Combat
,
the
Cunette
,
and
Saint-Mande
,
with
*NL*
their
discharging
mouths
,
their
apparatus
,
their
cesspools
,
and
their
*NL*
depuratory
branches
,
only
date
from
1836
.
The
intestinal
sewer
of
Paris
*NL*
has
been
made
over
anew
,
and
,
as
we
have
said
,
it
has
been
extended
more
*NL*
than
tenfold
within
the
last
quarter
of
a
century
.

*NL*
Thirty
years
ago
,
at
the
epoch
of
the
insurrection
of
the
5th
and
6th
of
*NL*
June
,
it
was
still
,
in
many
localities
,
nearly
the
same
ancient
sewer
.
*NL*
A
very
great
number
of
streets
which
are
now
convex
were
then
sunken
*NL*
causeways
.
At
the
end
of
a
slope
,
where
the
tributaries
of
a
street
or
*NL*
cross-roads
ended
,
there
were
often
to
be
seen
large
,
square
gratings
*NL*
with
heavy
bars
,
whose
iron
,
polished
by
the
footsteps
of
the
throng
,
*NL*
gleamed
dangerous
and
slippery
for
vehicles
,
and
caused
horses
to
fall
.
*NL*
The
official
language
of
the
Roads
and
Bridges
gave
to
these
gratings
*NL*
the
expressive
name
of
Cassis
.

It
consisted
of
enormous
*NL*
voids
of
stone
catch-basins
sometimes
surrounded
by
stone
posts
,
with
*NL*
monumental
effrontery

*NL*
*NL*
Paris
in
1806
still
had
nearly
the
same
sewers
numerically
as
stated
in
*NL*
1663
;
five
thousand
three
hundred
fathoms
.
After
Bruneseau
,
on
the
1st
*NL*
of
January
,
1832
,
it
had
forty
thousand
three
hundred
metres
.
Between

1806
and
1831
,
there
had
been
built
,
on
an
average
,
seven
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
metres
annually
,
afterwards
eight
and
even
ten
thousand
metres
of
*NL*
galleries
were
constructed
every

,
in
masonry
,
of
small
stones
,
with
*NL*
hydraulic
mortar
which
hardens
under

,
on

At

two
hundred
francs
the

,
the
sixty
leagues
of
Paris
'
sewers
of
the
*NL*
present
day
represent
forty-eight
millions
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
the
economic
progress
which
we
have
indicated
at
the
*NL*
beginning
,
grave
problems
of
public
hygiene
are
connected
with
that
*NL*
immense
question
:
the
sewers
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Paris
is
the
centre
of
two
sheets
,
a
sheet
of
water
and
a
sheet
of
air
.
*NL*
The
sheet
of
water
,
lying
at
a
tolerably
great
depth
underground
,
but
*NL*
already
sounded
by
two
bores
,
is
furnished
by
the
layer
of
green
clay
*NL*
situated
between
the
chalk
and
the
Jurassic
lime-stone
;
this
layer
may
*NL*
be
represented
by
a
disk
five
and
twenty
leagues
in
circumference
;
a
*NL*
multitude
of
rivers
and
brooks
ooze
there
;
one
drinks
the
Seine
,
the
*NL*
Marne
,
the
Yonne
,
the
Oise
,
the
Aisne
,
the
Cher
,
the
Vienne
and
the
*NL*
Loire
in
a
glass
of
water
from
the
well
of
Grenelle
.
The
sheet
of
water
*NL*
is
healthy
,
it
comes
from
heaven
in
the
first
place
and
next
from
the
*NL*
earth
;
the
sheet
of
air
is
unhealthy
,
it
comes
from
the
sewer
.
All
the
*NL*
miasms
of
the
cess-pool
are
mingled
with
the
breath
of
the
city
;
hence
*NL*
this
bad
breath
.
The
air
taken
from
above
a
dung-heap
,
as
has
been
*NL*
scientifically
proved
,
is
purer
than
the
air
taken
from
above
Paris
.
In
*NL*
a
given
time
,
with
the
aid
of
progress
,
mechanisms
become
perfected
,
and
*NL*
as
light
increases
,
the
sheet
of
water
will
be
employed
to
purify
the
*NL*
sheet
of
air
;
that
is
to
say
,
to
wash
the
sewer
.
The
reader
knows
,
that
*NL*
by
``
washing
the
sewer
''
we
mean
:
the
restitution
of
the
filth
to
the
*NL*
earth
;
the
return
to
the
soil
of
dung
and
of
manure
to
the
fields
.
*NL*
Through
this
simple
act
,
the
entire
social
community
will
experience
a
*NL*
diminution
of
misery
and
an
augmentation
of
health
.
At
the
present
hour
,
*NL*
the
radiation
of
diseases
from
Paris
extends
to
fifty
leagues
around
the
*NL*
Louvre
,
taken
as
the
hub
of
this
pestilential
wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
might
say
that
,
for
ten
centuries
,
the
cess-pool
has
been
the
disease
*NL*
of
Paris
.
The
sewer
is
the
blemish
which
Paris
has
in
her
blood
.
The
*NL*
popular
instinct
has
never
been
deceived
in
it
.
The
occupation
of
*NL*
sewermen
was
formerly
almost
as
perilous
,
and
almost
as
repugnant
to
the
*NL*
people
,
as
the
occupation
of
knacker
,
which
was
so
long
held
in
horror
*NL*
and
handed
over
to
the
executioner
.
High
wages
were
necessary
to
induce
*NL*
a
mason
to
disappear
in
that
fetid
mine
;
the
ladder
of
the
cess-pool
*NL*
cleaner
hesitated
to
plunge
into
it
;
it
was
said
,
in
proverbial
form
:
*NL*
``
to
descend
into
the
sewer
is
to
enter
the
grave
;
''
and
all
sorts
of
*NL*
hideous
legends
,
as
we
have
said
,
covered
this
colossal
sink
with
*NL*
terror
;
a
dread
sink-hole
which
bears
the
traces
of
the
revolutions
*NL*
of
the
globe
as
of
the
revolutions
of
man
,
and
where
are
to
be
found
*NL*
vestiges
of
all
cataclysms
from
the
shells
of
the
Deluge
to
the
rag
of
*NL*
Marat

--
THE
SEWER
AND
ITS
SURPRISES
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
sewers
of
Paris
that
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
another
resemblance
between
Paris
and
the
sea
.
As
in
the
ocean
,
*NL*
the
diver
may
disappear
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
transition
was
an
unheard-of
one
.
In
the
very
heart
of
the
city
,
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
escaped
from
the
city
,
and
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
*NL*
in
the
time
required
to
lift
the
cover
and
to
replace
it
,
he
had
passed
*NL*
from
broad
daylight
to
complete
obscurity
,
from
midday
to
midnight
,
from
*NL*
tumult
to
silence
,
from
the
whirlwind
of
thunders
to
the
stagnation
of
*NL*
the
tomb
,
and
,
by
a
vicissitude
far
more
tremendous
even
than
that
of
*NL*
the
Rue
Polonceau
,
from
the
most
extreme
peril
to
the
most
absolute
*NL*
obscurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
abrupt
fall
into
a
cavern
;
a
disappearance
into
the
secret
trap-door
*NL*
of
Paris
;
to
quit
that
street
where
death
was
on
every
side
,
for
that
*NL*
sort
of
sepulchre
where
there
was
life
,
was
a
strange
instant
.
He
*NL*
remained
for
several
seconds
as
though
bewildered
;
listening
,
stupefied
.
*NL*
The
waste-trap
of
safety
had
suddenly
yawned
beneath
him
.
Celestial
*NL*
goodness
had
,
in
a
manner
,
captured
him
by
treachery
.
Adorable
*NL*
ambuscades
of
providence
!
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
the
wounded
man
did
not
stir
,
and
Jean
Valjean
did
not
know
*NL*
whether
that
which
he
was
carrying
in
that
grave
was
a
living
being
or
a
*NL*
dead
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
first
sensation
was
one
of
blindness
.
All
of
a
sudden
,
he
could
see
*NL*
nothing
.
It
seemed
to
him
too
,
that
,
in
one
instant
,
he
had
become
deaf
.
*NL*
He
no
longer
heard
anything
.
The
frantic
storm
of
murder
which
had
been
*NL*
let
loose
a
few
feet
above
his
head
did
not
reach
him
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
thickness
of
the
earth
which
separated
him
from
it
,
as
we
have
said
,
*NL*
otherwise
than
faintly
and
indistinctly
,
and
like
a
rumbling
,
in
the
*NL*
depths
.
He
felt
that
the
ground
was
solid
under
his
feet
;
that
was
all
;
*NL*
but
that
was
enough
.
He
extended
one
arm
and
then
the
other
,
touched
*NL*
the
walls
on
both
sides
,
and
perceived
that
the
passage
was
narrow
;
he
*NL*
slipped
,
and
thus
perceived
that
the
pavement
was
wet
.
He
cautiously
put
*NL*
forward
one
foot
,
fearing
a
hole
,
a
sink
,
some
gulf
;
he
discovered
that
*NL*
the
paving
continued
.
A
gust
of
fetidness
informed
him
of
the
place
in
*NL*
which
he
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
he
was
no
longer
blind
.
A
little
light
*NL*
fell
through
the
man-hole
through
which
he
had
descended
,
and
his
eyes
*NL*
became
accustomed
to
this
cavern
.
He
began
to
distinguish
something
.
The
*NL*
passage
in
which
he
had
burrowed
--
no
other
word
can
better
express
the
*NL*
situation
--
was
walled
in
behind
him
.
It
was
one
of
those
blind
alleys
,
*NL*
which
the
special
jargon
terms
branches
.
In
front
of
him
there
was
*NL*
another
wall
,
a
wall
like
night
.
The
light
of
the
air-hole
died
out
ten
*NL*
or
twelve
paces
from
the
point
where
Jean
Valjean
stood
,
and
barely
cast
*NL*
a
wan
pallor
on
a
few
metres
of
the
damp
walls
of
the
sewer
.
Beyond
,
*NL*
the
opaqueness
was
massive
;
to
penetrate
thither
seemed
horrible
,
an
*NL*
entrance
into
it
appeared
like
an
engulfment
.
A
man
could
,
however
,
*NL*
plunge
into
that
wall
of
fog
and
it
was
necessary
so
to
do
.
Haste
was
*NL*
even
requisite
.
It
occurred
to
Jean
Valjean
that
the
grating
which
he
*NL*
had
caught
sight
of
under
the
flag-stones
might
also
catch
the
eye
of
*NL*
the
soldiery
,
and
that
everything
hung
upon
this
chance
.
They
also
might
*NL*
descend
into
that
well
and
search
it
.
There
was
not
a
minute
to
be
lost
.
*NL*
He
had
deposited
Marius
on
the
ground
,
he
picked
him
up
again
,
--
that
is
*NL*
the
real
word
for
it
,
--
placed
him
on
his
shoulders
once
more
,
and
set
*NL*
out
.
He
plunged
resolutely
into
the
gloom
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
truth
is
,
that
they
were
less
safe
than
Jean
Valjean
fancied
.
Perils
*NL*
of
another
sort
and
no
less
serious
were
awaiting
them
,
perchance
.
After
*NL*
the
lightning-charged
whirlwind
of
the
combat
,
the
cavern
of
miasmas
and
*NL*
traps
;
after
chaos
,
the
sewer
.
Jean
Valjean
had
fallen
from
one
circle
*NL*
of
hell
into
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
advanced
fifty
paces
,
he
was
obliged
to
halt
.
A
problem
*NL*
presented
itself
.
The
passage
terminated
in
another
gut
which
he
*NL*
encountered
across
his
path
.
There
two
ways
presented
themselves
.
Which
*NL*
should
he
take
?
Ought
he
to
turn
to
the
left
or
to
the
right
?
How
was
he
*NL*
to
find
his
bearings
in
that
black
labyrinth
?
This
labyrinth
,
to
which
*NL*
we
have
already
called
the
reader
's
attention
,
has
a
clue
,
which
is
its
*NL*
slope
.
To
follow
to
the
slope
is
to
arrive
at
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
Jean
Valjean
instantly
comprehended
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
that
he
was
probably
in
the
sewer
des
Halles
;
that
*NL*
if
he
were
to
choose
the
path
to
the
left
and
follow
the
slope
,
he
would
*NL*
arrive
,
in
less
than
a
quarter
of
an
hour
,
at
some
mouth
on
the
Seine
*NL*
between
the
Pont
au
Change
and
the
Pont-Neuf
,
that
is
to
say
,
he
would
*NL*
make
his
appearance
in
broad
daylight
on
the
most
densely
peopled
spot
*NL*
in
Paris
.
Perhaps
he
would
come
out
on
some
man-hole
at
the
intersection
*NL*
of
streets
.
Amazement
of
the
passers-by
at
beholding
two
bleeding
men
*NL*
emerge
from
the
earth
at
their
feet
.
Arrival
of
the
police
,
a
call
to
*NL*
arms
of
the
neighboring
post
of
guards
.
Thus
they
would
be
seized
before
*NL*
they
had
even
got
out
.
It
would
be
better
to
plunge
into
that
labyrinth
,
*NL*
to
confide
themselves
to
that
black
gloom
,
and
to
trust
to
Providence
*NL*
for
the
outcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
ascended
the
incline
,
and
turned
to
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
turned
the
angle
of
the
gallery
,
the
distant
glimmer
of
an
*NL*
air-hole
disappeared
,
the
curtain
of
obscurity
fell
upon
him
once
more
,
*NL*
and
he
became
blind
again
.
Nevertheless
,
he
advanced
as
rapidly
as
*NL*
possible
.
Marius
'
two
arms
were
passed
round
his
neck
,
and
the
former
's
*NL*
feet
dragged
behind
him
.
He
held
both
these
arms
with
one
hand
,
and
*NL*
groped
along
the
wall
with
the
other
.
Marius
'
cheek
touched
his
,
and
*NL*
clung
there
,
bleeding
.
He
felt
a
warm
stream
which
came
from
Marius
*NL*
trickling
down
upon
him
and
making
its
way
under
his
clothes
.
But
a
*NL*
humid
warmth
near
his
ear
,
which
the
mouth
of
the
wounded
man
touched
,
*NL*
indicated
respiration
,
and
consequently
,
life
.
The
passage
along
which
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
now
proceeding
was
not
so
narrow
as
the
first
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
walked
through
it
with
considerable
difficulty
.
The
rain
of
the
*NL*
preceding
day
had
not
,
as
yet
,
entirely
run
off
,
and
it
created
a
little
*NL*
torrent
in
the
centre
of
the
bottom
,
and
he
was
forced
to
hug
the
wall
*NL*
in
order
not
to
have
his
feet
in
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
proceeded
in
the
gloom
.
He
resembled
the
beings
of
the
night
*NL*
groping
in
the
invisible
and
lost
beneath
the
earth
in
veins
of
shadow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
little
by
little
,
whether
it
was
that
the
distant
air-holes
*NL*
emitted
a
little
wavering
light
in
this
opaque
gloom
,
or
whether
his
*NL*
eyes
had
become
accustomed
to
the
obscurity
,
some
vague
vision
returned
*NL*
to
him
,
and
he
began
once
more
to
gain
a
confused
idea
,
now
of
the
wall
*NL*
which
he
touched
,
now
of
the
vault
beneath
which
he
was
passing
.
The
*NL*
pupil
dilates
in
the
dark
,
and
the
soul
dilates
in
misfortune
and
ends
*NL*
by
finding
God
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
easy
to
direct
his
course
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
line
of
the
sewer
re-echoes
,
so
to
speak
,
the
line
of
the
streets
*NL*
which
lie
above
it
.
There
were
then
in
Paris
two
thousand
two
hundred
*NL*
streets
.
Let
the
reader
imagine
himself
beneath
that
forest
of
gloomy
*NL*
branches
which
is
called
the
sewer
.
The
system
of
sewers
existing
at
*NL*
that
epoch
,
placed
end
to
end
,
would
have
given
a
length
of
eleven
*NL*
leagues
.
We
have
said
above
,
that
the
actual
net-work
,
thanks
to
the
*NL*
special
activity
of
the
last
thirty
years
,
was
no
less
than
sixty
*NL*
leagues
in
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
began
by
committing
a
blunder
.
He
thought
that
he
was
*NL*
beneath
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
,
and
it
was
a
pity
that
it
was
not
so
.
Under
*NL*
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
there
is
an
old
stone
sewer
which
dates
from
Louis
*NL*
XIII
.
and
which
runs
straight
to
the
collecting
sewer
,
called
the
Grand
*NL*
Sewer
,
with
but
a
single
elbow
,
on
the
right
,
on
the
elevation
of
the
*NL*
ancient
Cour
des
Miracles
,
and
a
single
branch
,
the
Saint-Martin
sewer
,
*NL*
whose
four
arms
describe
a
cross
.
But
the
gut
of
the
Petite-Truanderie
*NL*
the
entrance
to
which
was
in
the
vicinity
of
the
Corinthe
wine-shop
has
*NL*
never
communicated
with
the
sewer
of
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
;
it
ended
*NL*
at
the
Montmartre
sewer
,
and
it
was
in
this
that
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
entangled
.
There
opportunities
of
losing
oneself
abound
.
The
Montmartre
*NL*
sewer
is
one
of
the
most
labyrinthine
of
the
ancient
network
.
*NL*
Fortunately
,
Jean
Valjean
had
left
behind
him
the
sewer
of
the
markets
*NL*
whose
geometrical
plan
presents
the
appearance
of
a
multitude
of
*NL*
parrots
'
roosts
piled
on
top
of
each
other
;
but
he
had
before
him
more
*NL*
than
one
embarrassing
encounter
and
more
than
one
street
corner
--
for
*NL*
they
are
streets
--
presenting
itself
in
the
gloom
like
an
interrogation
*NL*
point
;
first
,
on
his
left
,
the
vast
sewer
of
the
Platriere
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
Chinese
puzzle
,
thrusting
out
and
entangling
its
chaos
of
Ts
and
Zs
*NL*
under
the
Post-Office
and
under
the
rotunda
of
the
Wheat
Market
,
as
far
*NL*
as
the
Seine
,
where
it
terminates
in
a
Y
;
secondly
,
on
his
right
,
the
*NL*
curving
corridor
of
the
Rue
du
Cadran
with
its
three
teeth
,
which
*NL*
are
also
blind
courts
;
thirdly
,
on
his
left
,
the
branch
of
the
*NL*
Mail
,
complicated
,
almost
at
its
inception
,
with
a
sort
of
fork
,
and
*NL*
proceeding
from
zig-zag
to
zig-zag
until
it
ends
in
the
grand
crypt
of
*NL*
the
outlet
of
the
Louvre
,
truncated
and
ramified
in
every
direction
;
and
*NL*
lastly
,
the
blind
alley
of
a
passage
of
the
Rue
des
Jeuneurs
,
without
*NL*
counting
little
ducts
here
and
there
,
before
reaching
the
belt
sewer
,
*NL*
which
alone
could
conduct
him
to
some
issue
sufficiently
distant
to
be
*NL*
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Jean
Valjean
had
any
idea
of
all
that
we
have
here
pointed
out
,
he
*NL*
would
speedily
have
perceived
,
merely
by
feeling
the
wall
,
that
he
was
*NL*
not
in
the
subterranean
gallery
of
the
Rue
Saint-Denis
.
Instead
of
the
*NL*
ancient
stone
,
instead
of
the
antique
architecture
,
haughty
and
royal
*NL*
even
in
the
sewer
,
with
pavement
and
string
courses
of
granite
and
*NL*
mortar
costing
eight
hundred
livres
the
fathom
,
he
would
have
felt
under
*NL*
his
hand
contemporary
cheapness
,
economical
expedients
,
porous
stone
*NL*
filled
with
mortar
on
a
concrete
foundation
,
which
costs
two
hundred
*NL*
francs
the
metre
,
and
the
bourgeoise
masonry
known
as
a
petits
*NL*
materiaux
--
small
stuff
;
but
of
all
this
he
knew
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
advanced
with
anxiety
,
but
with
calmness
,
seeing
nothing
,
knowing
*NL*
nothing
,
buried
in
chance
,
that
is
to
say
,
engulfed
in
providence
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
degrees
,
we
will
admit
,
a
certain
horror
seized
upon
him
.
The
gloom
*NL*
which
enveloped
him
penetrated
his
spirit
.
He
walked
in
an
enigma
.
This
*NL*
aqueduct
of
the
sewer
is
formidable
;
it
interlaces
in
a
dizzy
fashion
.
*NL*
It
is
a
melancholy
thing
to
be
caught
in
this
Paris
of
shadows
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
was
obliged
to
find
and
even
to
invent
his
route
without
seeing
*NL*
it
.
In
this
unknown
,
every
step
that
he
risked
might
be
his
last
.
How
*NL*
was
he
to
get
out
?
should
he
find
an
issue
?
should
he
find
it
in
time
?
*NL*
would
that
colossal
subterranean
sponge
with
its
stone
cavities
,
allow
*NL*
itself
to
be
penetrated
and
pierced
?
should
he
there
encounter
some
*NL*
unexpected
knot
in
the
darkness
?
should
he
arrive
at
the
inextricable
*NL*
and
the
impassable
?
would
Marius
die
there
of
hemorrhage
and
he
of
*NL*
hunger
?
should
they
end
by
both
getting
lost
,
and
by
furnishing
two
*NL*
skeletons
in
a
nook
of
that
night
?
He
did
not
know
.
He
put
all
these
*NL*
questions
to
himself
without
replying
to
them
.
The
intestines
of
Paris
*NL*
form
a
precipice
.
Like
the
prophet
,
he
was
in
the
belly
of
the
monster
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
had
a
surprise
.
At
the
most
unforeseen
moment
,
and
*NL*
without
having
ceased
to
walk
in
a
straight
line
,
he
perceived
that
he
*NL*
was
no
longer
ascending
;
the
water
of
the
rivulet
was
beating
against
*NL*
his
heels
,
instead
of
meeting
him
at
his
toes
.
The
sewer
was
now
*NL*
descending
.
Why
?
Was
he
about
to
arrive
suddenly
at
the
Seine
?
This
*NL*
danger
was
a
great
one
,
but
the
peril
of
retreating
was
still
greater
.
*NL*
He
continued
to
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
towards
the
Seine
that
he
was
proceeding
.
The
ridge
which
*NL*
the
soil
of
Paris
forms
on
its
right
bank
empties
one
of
its
water-sheds
*NL*
into
the
Seine
and
the
other
into
the
Grand
Sewer
.
The
crest
of
this
*NL*
ridge
which
determines
the
division
of
the
waters
describes
a
very
*NL*
capricious
line
.
The
culminating
point
,
which
is
the
point
of
*NL*
separation
of
the
currents
,
is
in
the
Sainte-Avoye
sewer
,
beyond
the
Rue
*NL*
Michelle-Comte
,
in
the
sewer
of
the
Louvre
,
near
the
boulevards
,
and
*NL*
in
the
Montmartre
sewer
,
near
the
Halles
.
It
was
this
culminating
point
*NL*
that
Jean
Valjean
had
reached
.
He
was
directing
his
course
towards
the
*NL*
belt
sewer
;
he
was
on
the
right
path
.
But
he
did
not
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
time
that
he
encountered
a
branch
,
he
felt
of
its
angles
,
and
if
*NL*
he
found
that
the
opening
which
presented
itself
was
smaller
than
the
*NL*
passage
in
which
he
was
,
he
did
not
enter
but
continued
his
route
,
*NL*
rightly
judging
that
every
narrower
way
must
needs
terminate
in
a
blind
*NL*
alley
,
and
could
only
lead
him
further
from
his
goal
,
that
is
to
say
,
*NL*
the
outlet
.
Thus
he
avoided
the
quadruple
trap
which
was
set
for
him
in
*NL*
the
darkness
by
the
four
labyrinths
which
we
have
just
enumerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
certain
moment
,
he
perceived
that
he
was
emerging
from
beneath
*NL*
the
Paris
which
was
petrified
by
the
uprising
,
where
the
barricades
had
*NL*
suppressed
circulation
,
and
that
he
was
entering
beneath
the
living
and
*NL*
normal
Paris
.
Overhead
he
suddenly
heard
a
noise
as
of
thunder
,
distant
*NL*
but
continuous
.
It
was
the
rumbling
of
vehicles
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
walking
for
about
half
an
hour
,
at
least
according
to
the
*NL*
calculation
which
he
made
in
his
own
mind
,
and
he
had
not
yet
thought
of
*NL*
rest
;
he
had
merely
changed
the
hand
with
which
he
was
holding
Marius
.
*NL*
The
darkness
was
more
profound
than
ever
,
but
its
very
depth
reassured
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
saw
his
shadow
in
front
of
him
.
It
was
outlined
on
*NL*
a
faint
,
almost
indistinct
reddish
glow
,
which
vaguely
empurpled
the
*NL*
flooring
vault
underfoot
,
and
the
vault
overhead
,
and
gilded
to
his
*NL*
right
and
to
his
left
the
two
viscous
walls
of
the
passage
.
Stupefied
,
*NL*
he
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
him
,
in
the
portion
of
the
passage
which
he
had
just
passed
*NL*
through
,
at
a
distance
which
appeared
to
him
immense
,
piercing
the
dense
*NL*
obscurity
,
flamed
a
sort
of
horrible
star
which
had
the
air
of
surveying
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
gloomy
star
of
the
police
which
was
rising
in
the
sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
rear
of
that
star
eight
or
ten
forms
were
moving
about
in
a
*NL*
confused
way
,
black
,
upright
,
indistinct
,
horrible
.

CHAPTER
II
--
EXPLANATION
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
of
the
sixth
of
June
,
a
battue
of
the
sewers
had
been
*NL*
ordered
.
It
was
feared
that
the
vanquished
might
have
taken
to
them
for
*NL*
refuge
,
and
Prefect
Gisquet
was
to
search
occult
Paris
while
General
*NL*
Bugeaud
swept
public
Paris
;
a
double
and
connected
operation
which
*NL*
exacted
a
double
strategy
on
the
part
of
the
public
force
,
represented
*NL*
above
by
the
army
and
below
by
the
police
.
Three
squads
of
agents
and
*NL*
sewermen
explored
the
subterranean
drain
of
Paris
,
the
first
on
the
*NL*
right
bank
,
the
second
on
the
left
bank
,
the
third
in
the
city
.
The
*NL*
agents
of
police
were
armed
with
carabines
,
with
bludgeons
,
swords
and
*NL*
poignards
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
was
directed
at
Jean
Valjean
at
that
moment
,
was
the
lantern
*NL*
of
the
patrol
of
the
right
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
patrol
had
just
visited
the
curving
gallery
and
the
three
blind
*NL*
alleys
which
lie
beneath
the
Rue
du
Cadran
.
While
they
were
passing
*NL*
their
lantern
through
the
depths
of
these
blind
alleys
,
Jean
Valjean
had
*NL*
encountered
on
his
path
the
entrance
to
the
gallery
,
had
perceived
*NL*
that
it
was
narrower
than
the
principal
passage
and
had
not
penetrated
*NL*
thither
.
He
had
passed
on
.
The
police
,
on
emerging
from
the
gallery
*NL*
du
Cadran
,
had
fancied
that
they
heard
the
sound
of
footsteps
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
the
belt
sewer
.
They
were
,
in
fact
,
the
steps
of
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
The
sergeant
in
command
of
the
patrol
had
raised
his
lantern
,
*NL*
and
the
squad
had
begun
to
gaze
into
the
mist
in
the
direction
whence
*NL*
the
sound
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
indescribable
moment
for
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
,
if
he
saw
the
lantern
well
,
the
lantern
saw
him
but
ill
.
It
*NL*
was
light
and
he
was
shadow
.
He
was
very
far
off
,
and
mingled
with
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
place
.
He
hugged
the
wall
and
halted
.
Moreover
,
he
did
*NL*
not
understand
what
it
was
that
was
moving
behind
him
.
The
lack
of
sleep
*NL*
and
food
,
and
his
emotions
had
caused
him
also
to
pass
into
the
state
of
*NL*
a
visionary
.
He
beheld
a
gleam
,
and
around
that
gleam
,
forms
.
What
was
*NL*
it
?
He
did
not
comprehend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
having
paused
,
the
sound
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
of
the
patrol
listened
,
and
heard
nothing
,
they
looked
and
saw
*NL*
nothing
.
They
held
a
consultation
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
existed
at
that
epoch
at
this
point
of
the
Montmartre
sewer
a
sort
*NL*
of
cross-roads
called
de
service
,
which
was
afterwards
suppressed
,
on
*NL*
account
of
the
little
interior
lake
which
formed
there
,
swallowing
up
*NL*
the
torrent
of
rain
in
heavy
storms
.
The
patrol
could
form
a
cluster
in
*NL*
this
open
space
.
Jean
Valjean
saw
these
spectres
form
a
sort
of
circle
.
*NL*
These
bull-dogs
'
heads
approached
each
other
closely
and
whispered
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
result
of
this
council
held
by
the
watch
dogs
was
,
that
they
had
*NL*
been
mistaken
,
that
there
had
been
no
noise
,
that
it
was
useless
to
get
*NL*
entangled
in
the
belt
sewer
,
that
it
would
only
be
a
waste
of
time
,
*NL*
but
that
they
ought
to
hasten
towards
Saint-Merry
;
that
if
there
*NL*
was
anything
to
do
,
and
any
``
bousingot
''
to
track
out
,
it
was
in
that
*NL*
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
,
parties
re-sole
their
old
insults
.
In
1832
,
the
word
*NL*
bousingot
formed
the
interim
between
the
word
jacobin
,
which
had
become
*NL*
obsolete
,
and
the
word
demagogue
which
has
since
rendered
such
excellent
*NL*
service
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
gave
orders
to
turn
to
the
left
,
towards
the
watershed
of
*NL*
the
Seine
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
occurred
to
them
to
separate
into
two
squads
,
and
to
go
in
*NL*
both
directions
,
Jean
Valjean
would
have
been
captured
.
All
hung
on
*NL*
that
thread
.
It
is
probable
that
the
instructions
of
the
prefecture
,
*NL*
foreseeing
a
possibility
of
combat
and
insurgents
in
force
,
had
*NL*
forbidden
the
patrol
to
part
company
.
The
patrol
resumed
its
march
,
*NL*
leaving
Jean
Valjean
behind
it
.
Of
all
this
movement
,
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
perceived
nothing
,
except
the
eclipse
of
the
lantern
which
suddenly
*NL*
wheeled
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
taking
his
departure
,
the
Sergeant
,
in
order
to
acquit
his
*NL*
policeman
's
conscience
,
discharged
his
gun
in
the
direction
of
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
The
detonation
rolled
from
echo
to
echo
in
the
crypt
,
like
the
*NL*
rumbling
of
that
titanic
entrail
.
A
bit
of
plaster
which
fell
into
the
*NL*
stream
and
splashed
up
the
water
a
few
paces
away
from
Jean
Valjean
,
*NL*
warned
him
that
the
ball
had
struck
the
arch
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Slow
and
measured
steps
resounded
for
some
time
on
the
timber
work
,
*NL*
gradually
dying
away
as
they
retreated
to
a
greater
distance
;
the
group
*NL*
of
black
forms
vanished
,
a
glimmer
of
light
oscillated
and
floated
,
*NL*
communicating
to
the
vault
a
reddish
glow
which
grew
fainter
,
then
*NL*
disappeared
;
the
silence
became
profound
once
more
,
the
obscurity
became
*NL*
complete
,
blindness
and
deafness
resumed
possession
of
the
shadows
;
*NL*
and
Jean
Valjean
,
not
daring
to
stir
as
yet
,
remained
for
a
long
time
*NL*
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
wall
,
with
straining
ears
,
and
dilated
*NL*
pupils
,
watching
the
disappearance
of
that
phantom
patrol
.
*NL*

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
``
SPUN
''
MAN
*NL*
*NL*
This
justice
must
be
rendered
to
the
police
of
that
period
,
that
even
in
*NL*
the
most
serious
public
junctures
,
it
imperturbably
fulfilled
its
duties
*NL*
connected
with
the
sewers
and
surveillance
.
A
revolt
was
,
in
its
eyes
,
*NL*
no
pretext
for
allowing
malefactors
to
take
the
bit
in
their
own
mouths
,
*NL*
and
for
neglecting
society
for
the
reason
that
the
government
was
in
*NL*
peril
.
The
ordinary
service
was
performed
correctly
in
company
with
the
*NL*
extraordinary
service
,
and
was
not
troubled
by
the
latter
.
In
the
midst
*NL*
of
an
incalculable
political
event
already
begun
,
under
the
pressure
of
*NL*
a
possible
revolution
,
a
police
agent
,
``
spun
''
a
thief
without
allowing
*NL*
himself
to
be
distracted
by
insurrection
and
barricades
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
something
precisely
parallel
which
took
place
on
the
afternoon
*NL*
of
the
6th
of
June
on
the
banks
of
the
Seine
,
on
the
slope
of
the
right
*NL*
shore
,
a
little
beyond
the
Pont
des
Invalides
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
longer
any
bank
there
now
.
The
aspect
of
the
locality
has
*NL*
changed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
bank
,
two
men
,
separated
by
a
certain
distance
,
seemed
to
be
*NL*
watching
each
other
while
mutually
avoiding
each
other
.
The
one
who
was
*NL*
in
advance
was
trying
to
get
away
,
the
one
in
the
rear
was
trying
to
*NL*
overtake
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
a
game
of
checkers
played
at
a
distance
and
in
silence
.
*NL*
Neither
seemed
to
be
in
any
hurry
,
and
both
walked
slowly
,
as
though
*NL*
each
of
them
feared
by
too
much
haste
to
make
his
partner
redouble
his
*NL*
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
would
have
said
that
it
was
an
appetite
following
its
prey
,
and
*NL*
purposely
without
wearing
the
air
of
doing
so
.
The
prey
was
crafty
and
*NL*
on
its
guard
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
proper
relations
between
the
hunted
pole-cat
and
the
hunting
dog
*NL*
were
observed
.
The
one
who
was
seeking
to
escape
had
an
insignificant
*NL*
mien
and
not
an
impressive
appearance
;
the
one
who
was
seeking
to
seize
*NL*
him
was
rude
of
aspect
,
and
must
have
been
rude
to
encounter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
,
conscious
that
he
was
the
more
feeble
,
avoided
the
second
;
*NL*
but
he
avoided
him
in
a
manner
which
was
deeply
furious
;
any
one
who
*NL*
could
have
observed
him
would
have
discerned
in
his
eyes
the
sombre
*NL*
hostility
of
flight
,
and
all
the
menace
that
fear
contains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shore
was
deserted
;
there
were
no
passers-by
;
not
even
a
boatman
nor
*NL*
a
lighter-man
was
in
the
skiffs
which
were
moored
here
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
easy
to
see
these
two
men
,
except
from
the
quay
opposite
,
and
*NL*
to
any
person
who
had
scrutinized
them
at
that
distance
,
the
man
who
was
*NL*
in
advance
would
have
appeared
like
a
bristling
,
tattered
,
and
equivocal
*NL*
being
,
who
was
uneasy
and
trembling
beneath
a
ragged
blouse
,
and
the
*NL*
other
like
a
classic
and
official
personage
,
wearing
the
frock-coat
of
*NL*
authority
buttoned
to
the
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perchance
the
reader
might
recognize
these
two
men
,
if
he
were
to
see
*NL*
them
closer
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
the
object
of
the
second
man
?
*NL*
*NL*
Probably
to
succeed
in
clothing
the
first
more
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
man
clothed
by
the
state
pursues
a
man
in
rags
,
it
is
in
order
*NL*
to
make
of
him
a
man
who
is
also
clothed
by
the
state
.
Only
,
the
whole
*NL*
question
lies
in
the
color
.
To
be
dressed
in
blue
is
glorious
;
to
be
*NL*
dressed
in
red
is
disagreeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
purple
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probably
some
unpleasantness
and
some
purple
of
this
sort
which
*NL*
the
first
man
is
desirous
of
shirking
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
other
allowed
him
to
walk
on
,
and
had
not
seized
him
as
yet
,
it
*NL*
was
,
judging
from
all
appearances
,
in
the
hope
of
seeing
him
lead
up
to
*NL*
some
significant
meeting-place
and
to
some
group
worth
catching
.
This
*NL*
delicate
operation
is
called
``
spinning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
renders
this
conjecture
entirely
probable
is
that
the
buttoned-up
*NL*
man
,
on
catching
sight
from
the
shore
of
a
hackney-coach
on
the
quay
*NL*
as
it
was
passing
along
empty
,
made
a
sign
to
the
driver
;
the
driver
*NL*
understood
,
evidently
recognized
the
person
with
whom
he
had
to
deal
,
*NL*
turned
about
and
began
to
follow
the
two
men
at
the
top
of
the
quay
,
*NL*
at
a
foot-pace
.
This
was
not
observed
by
the
slouching
and
tattered
*NL*
personage
who
was
in
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hackney-coach
rolled
along
the
trees
of
the
Champs-Elysees
.
The
*NL*
bust
of
the
driver
,
whip
in
hand
,
could
be
seen
moving
along
above
the
*NL*
parapet
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
secret
instructions
of
the
police
authorities
to
their
agents
*NL*
contains
this
article
:
``
Always
have
on
hand
a
hackney-coach
,
in
case
of
*NL*
emergency
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
two
men
were
manoeuvring
,
each
on
his
own
side
,
with
*NL*
irreproachable
strategy
,
they
approached
an
inclined
plane
on
the
quay
*NL*
which
descended
to
the
shore
,
and
which
permitted
cab-drivers
arriving
*NL*
from
Passy
to
come
to
the
river
and
water
their
horses
.
This
inclined
*NL*
plane
was
suppressed
later
on
,
for
the
sake
of
symmetry
;
horses
may
die
*NL*
of
thirst
,
but
the
eye
is
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
the
man
in
the
blouse
had
intended
to
ascend
*NL*
this
inclined
plane
,
with
a
view
to
making
his
escape
into
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysees
,
a
place
ornamented
with
trees
,
but
,
in
return
,
much
*NL*
infested
with
policemen
,
and
where
the
other
could
easily
exercise
*NL*
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
point
on
the
quay
is
not
very
far
distant
from
the
house
brought
to
*NL*
Paris
from
Moret
in
1824
,
by
Colonel
Brack
,
and
designated
as
``
the
house
*NL*
of
Francois
I.
''
A
guard
house
is
situated
close
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
great
surprise
of
his
watcher
,
the
man
who
was
being
tracked
did
*NL*
not
mount
by
the
inclined
plane
for
watering
.
He
continued
to
advance
*NL*
along
the
quay
on
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
position
was
visibly
becoming
critical
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
intending
to
do
,
if
not
to
throw
himself
into
the
Seine
?
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
,
there
existed
no
means
of
ascending
to
the
quay
;
there
was
*NL*
no
other
inclined
plane
,
no
staircase
;
and
they
were
near
the
spot
,
*NL*
marked
by
the
bend
in
the
Seine
towards
the
Pont
de
Jena
,
where
the
*NL*
bank
,
growing
constantly
narrower
,
ended
in
a
slender
tongue
,
and
*NL*
was
lost
in
the
water
.
There
he
would
inevitably
find
himself
blocked
*NL*
between
the
perpendicular
wall
on
his
right
,
the
river
on
his
left
and
*NL*
in
front
of
him
,
and
the
authorities
on
his
heels
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
this
termination
of
the
shore
was
hidden
from
sight
by
a
*NL*
heap
of
rubbish
six
or
seven
feet
in
height
,
produced
by
some
demolition
*NL*
or
other
.
But
did
this
man
hope
to
conceal
himself
effectually
behind
*NL*
that
heap
of
rubbish
,
which
one
need
but
skirt
?
The
expedient
would
*NL*
have
been
puerile
.
He
certainly
was
not
dreaming
of
such
a
thing
.
The
*NL*
innocence
of
thieves
does
not
extend
to
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pile
of
rubbish
formed
a
sort
of
projection
at
the
water
's
edge
,
*NL*
which
was
prolonged
in
a
promontory
as
far
as
the
wall
of
the
quay
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
who
was
being
followed
arrived
at
this
little
mound
and
went
*NL*
round
it
,
so
that
he
ceased
to
be
seen
by
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
latter
,
as
he
did
not
see
,
could
not
be
seen
;
he
took
advantage
of
*NL*
this
fact
to
abandon
all
dissimulation
and
to
walk
very
rapidly
.
In
a
*NL*
few
moments
,
he
had
reached
the
rubbish
heap
and
passed
round
it
.
There
*NL*
he
halted
in
sheer
amazement
.
The
man
whom
he
had
been
pursuing
was
no
*NL*
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Total
eclipse
of
the
man
in
the
blouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shore
,
beginning
with
the
rubbish
heap
,
was
only
about
thirty
paces
*NL*
long
,
then
it
plunged
into
the
water
which
beat
against
the
wall
of
the
*NL*
quay
.
The
fugitive
could
not
have
thrown
himself
into
the
Seine
without
*NL*
being
seen
by
the
man
who
was
following
him
.
What
had
become
of
him
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
in
the
buttoned-up
coat
walked
to
the
extremity
of
the
shore
,
*NL*
and
remained
there
in
thought
for
a
moment
,
his
fists
clenched
,
his
eyes
*NL*
searching
.
All
at
once
he
smote
his
brow
.
He
had
just
perceived
,
at
the
*NL*
point
where
the
land
came
to
an
end
and
the
water
began
,
a
large
iron
*NL*
grating
,
low
,
arched
,
garnished
with
a
heavy
lock
and
with
three
massive
*NL*
hinges
.
This
grating
,
a
sort
of
door
pierced
at
the
base
of
the
quay
,
*NL*
opened
on
the
river
as
well
as
on
the
shore
.
A
blackish
stream
passed
*NL*
under
it
.
This
stream
discharged
into
the
Seine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
heavy
,
rusty
iron
bars
,
a
sort
of
dark
and
vaulted
corridor
*NL*
could
be
descried
.
The
man
folded
his
arms
and
stared
at
the
grating
*NL*
with
an
air
of
reproach
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
this
gaze
did
not
suffice
,
he
tried
to
thrust
it
aside
;
he
shook
*NL*
it
,
it
resisted
solidly
.
It
is
probable
that
it
had
just
been
opened
,
*NL*
although
no
sound
had
been
heard
,
a
singular
circumstance
in
so
rusty
a
*NL*
grating
;
but
it
is
certain
that
it
had
been
closed
again
.
This
indicated
*NL*
that
the
man
before
whom
that
door
had
just
opened
had
not
a
hook
but
a
*NL*
key
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evidence
suddenly
burst
upon
the
mind
of
the
man
who
was
trying
to
*NL*
move
the
grating
,
and
evoked
from
him
this
indignant
ejaculation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
too
much
!
A
government
key
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
immediately
regaining
his
composure
,
he
expressed
a
whole
world
*NL*
of
interior
ideas
by
this
outburst
of
monosyllables
accented
almost
*NL*
ironically
:
``
Come
!
Come
!
Come
!
Come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
and
in
the
hope
of
something
or
other
,
either
that
he
should
*NL*
see
the
man
emerge
or
other
men
enter
,
he
posted
himself
on
the
watch
*NL*
behind
a
heap
of
rubbish
,
with
the
patient
rage
of
a
pointer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hackney-coach
,
which
regulated
all
its
movements
on
his
,
had
,
in
its
*NL*
turn
,
halted
on
the
quay
above
him
,
close
to
the
parapet
.
The
coachman
,
*NL*
foreseeing
a
prolonged
wait
,
encased
his
horses
'
muzzles
in
the
bag
of
*NL*
oats
which
is
damp
at
the
bottom
,
and
which
is
so
familiar
to
Parisians
,
*NL*
to
whom
,
be
it
said
in
parenthesis
,
the
Government
sometimes
applies
it
.
*NL*
The
rare
passers-by
on
the
Pont
de
Jena
turned
their
heads
,
before
they
*NL*
pursued
their
way
,
to
take
a
momentary
glance
at
these
two
motionless
*NL*
items
in
the
landscape
,
the
man
on
the
shore
,
the
carriage
on
the
quay
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
HE
ALSO
BEARS
HIS
CROSS
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
resumed
his
march
and
had
not
again
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
march
became
more
and
more
laborious
.
The
level
of
these
vaults
*NL*
varies
;
the
average
height
is
about
five
feet
,
six
inches
,
and
has
been
*NL*
calculated
for
the
stature
of
a
man
;
Jean
Valjean
was
forced
to
bend
*NL*
over
,
in
order
not
to
strike
Marius
against
the
vault
;
at
every
step
*NL*
he
had
to
bend
,
then
to
rise
,
and
to
feel
incessantly
of
the
wall
.
The
*NL*
moisture
of
the
stones
,
and
the
viscous
nature
of
the
timber
framework
*NL*
furnished
but
poor
supports
to
which
to
cling
,
either
for
hand
or
foot
.
*NL*
He
stumbled
along
in
the
hideous
dung-heap
of
the
city
.
The
intermittent
*NL*
gleams
from
the
air-holes
only
appeared
at
very
long
intervals
,
and
were
*NL*
so
wan
that
the
full
sunlight
seemed
like
the
light
of
the
moon
;
all
*NL*
the
rest
was
mist
,
miasma
,
opaqueness
,
blackness
.
Jean
Valjean
was
both
*NL*
hungry
and
thirsty
;
especially
thirsty
;
and
this
,
like
the
sea
,
was
a
*NL*
place
full
of
water
where
a
man
can
not
drink
.
His
strength
,
which
was
*NL*
prodigious
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
and
which
had
been
but
little
decreased
*NL*
by
age
,
thanks
to
his
chaste
and
sober
life
,
began
to
give
way
,
*NL*
nevertheless
.
Fatigue
began
to
gain
on
him
;
and
as
his
strength
*NL*
decreased
,
it
made
the
weight
of
his
burden
increase
.
Marius
,
who
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
dead
,
weighed
him
down
as
inert
bodies
weigh
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
held
him
in
such
a
manner
that
his
chest
was
not
oppressed
,
and
so
that
*NL*
respiration
could
proceed
as
well
as
possible
.
Between
his
legs
he
felt
*NL*
the
rapid
gliding
of
the
rats
.
One
of
them
was
frightened
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
that
he
bit
him
.
From
time
to
time
,
a
breath
of
fresh
air
reached
*NL*
him
through
the
vent-holes
of
the
mouths
of
the
sewer
,
and
re-animated
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
three
hours
past
midday
when
he
reached
the
*NL*
belt-sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
,
at
first
,
astonished
at
this
sudden
widening
.
He
found
himself
,
*NL*
all
at
once
,
in
a
gallery
where
his
outstretched
hands
could
not
reach
*NL*
the
two
walls
,
and
beneath
a
vault
which
his
head
did
not
touch
.
The
*NL*
Grand
Sewer
is
,
in
fact
,
eight
feet
wide
and
seven
feet
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
point
where
the
Montmartre
sewer
joins
the
Grand
Sewer
,
two
other
*NL*
subterranean
galleries
,
that
of
the
Rue
de
Provence
,
and
that
of
the
*NL*
Abattoir
,
form
a
square
.
Between
these
four
ways
,
a
less
sagacious
man
*NL*
would
have
remained
undecided
.
Jean
Valjean
selected
the
broadest
,
that
*NL*
is
to
say
,
the
belt-sewer
.
But
here
the
question
again
came
up
--
should
*NL*
he
descend
or
ascend
?
He
thought
that
the
situation
required
haste
,
and
*NL*
that
he
must
now
gain
the
Seine
at
any
risk
.
In
other
terms
,
he
must
*NL*
descend
.
He
turned
to
the
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
that
he
did
so
,
for
it
is
an
error
to
suppose
that
the
*NL*
belt-sewer
has
two
outlets
,
the
one
in
the
direction
of
Bercy
,
the
other
*NL*
towards
Passy
,
and
that
it
is
,
as
its
name
indicates
,
the
subterranean
*NL*
girdle
of
the
Paris
on
the
right
bank
.
The
Grand
Sewer
,
which
is
,
it
*NL*
must
be
remembered
,
nothing
else
than
the
old
brook
of
Menilmontant
,
*NL*
terminates
,
if
one
ascends
it
,
in
a
blind
sack
,
that
is
to
say
,
at
its
*NL*
ancient
point
of
departure
which
was
its
source
,
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
knoll
of
Menilmontant
.
There
is
no
direct
communication
with
the
*NL*
branch
which
collects
the
waters
of
Paris
beginning
with
the
Quartier
*NL*
Popincourt
,
and
which
falls
into
the
Seine
through
the
Amelot
sewer
*NL*
above
the
ancient
Isle
Louviers
.
This
branch
,
which
completes
the
*NL*
collecting
sewer
,
is
separated
from
it
,
under
the
Rue
Menilmontant
*NL*
itself
,
by
a
pile
which
marks
the
dividing
point
of
the
waters
,
between
*NL*
upstream
and
downstream
.
If
Jean
Valjean
had
ascended
the
gallery
he
*NL*
would
have
arrived
,
after
a
thousand
efforts
,
and
broken
down
with
*NL*
fatigue
,
and
in
an
expiring
condition
,
in
the
gloom
,
at
a
wall
.
He
would
*NL*
have
been
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
case
of
necessity
,
by
retracing
his
steps
a
little
way
,
and
entering
*NL*
the
passage
of
the
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
on
condition
that
he
did
not
*NL*
hesitate
at
the
subterranean
crossing
of
the
Carrefour
Boucherat
,
and
by
*NL*
taking
the
corridor
Saint-Louis
,
then
the
Saint-Gilles
gut
on
the
left
,
*NL*
then
turning
to
the
right
and
avoiding
the
Saint-Sebastian
gallery
,
he
*NL*
might
have
reached
the
Amelot
sewer
,
and
thence
,
provided
that
he
did
*NL*
not
go
astray
in
the
sort
of
F
which
lies
under
the
Bastille
,
he
might
*NL*
have
attained
the
outlet
on
the
Seine
near
the
Arsenal
.
But
in
order
*NL*
to
do
this
,
he
must
have
been
thoroughly
familiar
with
the
enormous
*NL*
madrepore
of
the
sewer
in
all
its
ramifications
and
in
all
its
openings
.
*NL*
Now
,
we
must
again
insist
that
he
knew
nothing
of
that
frightful
drain
*NL*
which
he
was
traversing
;
and
had
any
one
asked
him
in
what
he
was
,
he
*NL*
would
have
answered
:
``
In
the
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
instinct
served
him
well
.
To
descend
was
,
in
fact
,
possible
safety
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
on
his
right
the
two
narrow
passages
which
branch
out
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
claw
under
the
Rue
Laffitte
and
the
Rue
Saint-Georges
and
the
*NL*
long
,
bifurcated
corridor
of
the
Chaussee
d'Antin
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
beyond
an
affluent
,
which
was
,
probably
,
the
Madeleine
branch
,
*NL*
he
halted
.
He
was
extremely
weary
.
A
passably
large
air-hole
,
probably
*NL*
the
man-hole
in
the
Rue
d'Anjou
,
furnished
a
light
that
was
almost
*NL*
vivid
.
Jean
Valjean
,
with
the
gentleness
of
movement
which
a
brother
*NL*
would
exercise
towards
his
wounded
brother
,
deposited
Marius
on
the
*NL*
banquette
of
the
sewer
.
Marius
'
blood-stained
face
appeared
under
the
*NL*
wan
light
of
the
air-hole
like
the
ashes
at
the
bottom
of
a
tomb
.
His
*NL*
eyes
were
closed
,
his
hair
was
plastered
down
on
his
temples
like
a
*NL*
painter
's
brushes
dried
in
red
wash
;
his
hands
hung
limp
and
dead
.
A
*NL*
clot
of
blood
had
collected
in
the
knot
of
his
cravat
;
his
limbs
were
*NL*
cold
,
and
blood
was
clotted
at
the
corners
of
his
mouth
;
his
shirt
had
*NL*
thrust
itself
into
his
wounds
,
the
cloth
of
his
coat
was
chafing
the
*NL*
yawning
gashes
in
the
living
flesh
.
Jean
Valjean
,
pushing
aside
the
*NL*
garments
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
,
laid
his
hand
upon
Marius
'
*NL*
breast
;
his
heart
was
still
beating
.
Jean
Valjean
tore
up
his
shirt
,
*NL*
bandaged
the
young
man
's
wounds
as
well
as
he
was
able
and
stopped
the
*NL*
flowing
blood
;
then
bending
over
Marius
,
who
still
lay
unconscious
*NL*
and
almost
without
breathing
,
in
that
half
light
,
he
gazed
at
him
with
*NL*
inexpressible
hatred
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
disarranging
Marius
'
garments
,
he
had
found
two
things
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
the
roll
which
had
been
forgotten
there
on
the
preceding
*NL*
evening
,
and
Marius
'
pocketbook
.
He
ate
the
roll
and
opened
the
*NL*
pocketbook
.
On
the
first
page
he
found
the
four
lines
written
by
Marius
.
*NL*
The
reader
will
recall
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Marius
Pontmercy
.
Carry
my
body
to
my
grandfather
,
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
,
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
No.
6
,
in
the
Marais
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
read
these
four
lines
by
the
light
of
the
air-hole
,
and
*NL*
remained
for
a
moment
as
though
absorbed
in
thought
,
repeating
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
:
``
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
number
6
,
Monsieur
Gillenormand
.
''
He
*NL*
replaced
the
pocketbook
in
Marius
'
pocket
.
He
had
eaten
,
his
strength
*NL*
had
returned
to
him
;
he
took
Marius
up
once
more
upon
his
back
,
placed
*NL*
the
latter
's
head
carefully
on
his
right
shoulder
,
and
resumed
his
*NL*
descent
of
the
sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grand
Sewer
,
directed
according
to
the
course
of
the
valley
of
*NL*
Menilmontant
,
is
about
two
leagues
long
.
It
is
paved
throughout
a
*NL*
notable
portion
of
its
extent
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
torch
of
the
names
of
the
streets
of
Paris
,
with
which
we
are
*NL*
illuminating
for
the
reader
Jean
Valjean
's
subterranean
march
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
himself
did
not
possess
.
Nothing
told
him
what
zone
of
the
city
*NL*
he
was
traversing
,
nor
what
way
he
had
made
.
Only
the
growing
pallor
of
*NL*
the
pools
of
light
which
he
encountered
from
time
to
time
indicated
to
*NL*
him
that
the
sun
was
withdrawing
from
the
pavement
,
and
that
the
day
*NL*
would
soon
be
over
;
and
the
rolling
of
vehicles
overhead
,
having
become
*NL*
intermittent
instead
of
continuous
,
then
having
almost
ceased
,
he
*NL*
concluded
that
he
was
no
longer
under
central
Paris
,
and
that
he
*NL*
was
approaching
some
solitary
region
,
in
the
vicinity
of
the
outer
*NL*
boulevards
,
or
the
extreme
outer
quays
.
Where
there
are
fewer
houses
and
*NL*
streets
,
the
sewer
has
fewer
air-holes
.
The
gloom
deepened
around
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
Nevertheless
,
he
continued
to
advance
,
groping
his
way
in

CHAPTER
V
--
IN
THE
CASE
OF
SAND
AS
IN
THAT
OF
WOMAN
,
THERE
IS
A
FINENESS
*NL*
WHICH
IS
TREACHEROUS
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
was
entering
the
water
,
and
that
he
no
longer
had
a
*NL*
pavement
under
his
feet
,
but
only
mud
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happens
,
that
on
certain
shores
of
Bretagne
or
Scotland
a
*NL*
man
,
either
a
traveller
or
a
fisherman
,
while
walking
at
low
tide
on
the
*NL*
beach
far
from
shore
,
suddenly
notices
that
for
several
minutes
past
,
*NL*
he
has
been
walking
with
some
difficulty
.
The
beach
under
foot
is
*NL*
like
pitch
;
his
soles
stick
fast
to
it
;
it
is
no
longer
sand
,
it
is
*NL*
bird-lime
.
The
strand
is
perfectly
dry
,
but
at
every
step
that
he
takes
,
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
foot
is
raised
,
the
print
is
filled
with
water
.
The
*NL*
eye
,
however
,
has
perceived
no
change
;
the
immense
beach
is
smooth
and
*NL*
tranquil
,
all
the
sand
has
the
same
aspect
,
nothing
distinguishes
the
*NL*
soil
that
is
solid
from
that
which
is
not
solid
;
the
joyous
little
*NL*
cloud
of
sand-lice
continues
to
leap
tumultuously
under
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
passer-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
pursues
his
way
,
he
walks
on
,
turns
towards
the
land
,
endeavors
*NL*
to
approach
the
shore
.
He
is
not
uneasy
.
Uneasy
about
what
?
Only
he
is
*NL*
conscious
that
the
heaviness
of
his
feet
seems
to
be
increasing
at
every
*NL*
step
that
he
takes
.
All
at
once
he
sinks
in
.
He
sinks
in
two
or
three
*NL*
inches
.
Decidedly
,
he
is
not
on
the
right
road
;
he
halts
to
get
his
*NL*
bearings
.
Suddenly
he
glances
at
his
feet
;
his
feet
have
disappeared
.
*NL*
The
sand
has
covered
them
.
He
draws
his
feet
out
of
the
sand
,
he
tries
*NL*
to
retrace
his
steps
,
he
turns
back
,
he
sinks
in
more
deeply
than
*NL*
before
.
The
sand
is
up
to
his
ankles
,
he
tears
himself
free
from
it
*NL*
and
flings
himself
to
the
left
,
the
sand
reaches
to
mid-leg
,
he
flings
*NL*
himself
to
the
right
,
the
sand
comes
up
to
his
knees
.
Then
,
with
*NL*
indescribable
terror
,
he
recognizes
the
fact
that
he
is
caught
in
a
*NL*
quicksand
,
and
that
he
has
beneath
him
that
frightful
medium
in
which
*NL*
neither
man
can
walk
nor
fish
can
swim
.
He
flings
away
his
burden
,
if
he
*NL*
have
one
,
he
lightens
himself
,
like
a
ship
in
distress
;
it
is
too
late
,
*NL*
the
sand
is
above
his
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shouts
,
he
waves
his
hat
,
or
his
handkerchief
,
the
sand
continually
*NL*
gains
on
him
;
if
the
beach
is
deserted
,
if
the
land
is
too
far
away
,
if
*NL*
the
bank
of
sand
is
too
ill-famed
,
there
is
no
hero
in
the
neighborhood
,
*NL*
all
is
over
,
he
is
condemned
to
be
engulfed
.
He
is
condemned
to
that
*NL*
terrible
interment
,
long
,
infallible
,
implacable
,
which
it
is
impossible
*NL*
to
either
retard
or
hasten
,
which
lasts
for
hours
,
which
will
not
come
*NL*
to
an
end
,
which
seizes
you
erect
,
free
,
in
the
flush
of
health
,
which
*NL*
drags
you
down
by
the
feet
,
which
,
at
every
effort
that
you
attempt
,
at
*NL*
every
shout
that
you
utter
,
draws
you
a
little
lower
,
which
has
the
air
*NL*
of
punishing
you
for
your
resistance
by
a
redoubled
grasp
,
which
forces
*NL*
a
man
to
return
slowly
to
earth
,
while
leaving
him
time
to
survey
the
*NL*
horizon
,
the
trees
,
the
verdant
country
,
the
smoke
of
the
villages
on
*NL*
the
plain
,
the
sails
of
the
ships
on
the
sea
,
the
birds
which
fly
*NL*
and
sing
,
the
sun
and
the
sky
.
This
engulfment
is
the
sepulchre
which
*NL*
assumes
a
tide
,
and
which
mounts
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
towards
*NL*
a
living
man
.
Each
minute
is
an
inexorable
layer-out
of
the
dead
.
The
*NL*
wretched
man
tries
to
sit
down
,
to
lie
down
,
to
climb
;
every
movement
*NL*
that
he
makes
buries
him
deeper
;
he
straightens
himself
up
,
he
sinks
;
he
*NL*
feels
that
he
is
being
swallowed
up
;
he
shrieks
,
implores
,
cries
to
the
*NL*
clouds
,
wrings
his
hands
,
grows
desperate
.
Behold
him
in
the
sand
up
*NL*
to
his
belly
,
the
sand
reaches
to
his
breast
,
he
is
only
a
bust
now
.
*NL*
He
uplifts
his
hands
,
utters
furious
groans
,
clenches
his
nails
on
the
*NL*
beach
,
tries
to
cling
fast
to
that
ashes
,
supports
himself
on
his
elbows
*NL*
in
order
to
raise
himself
from
that
soft
sheath
,
and
sobs
frantically
;
*NL*
the
sand
mounts
higher
.
The
sand
has
reached
his
shoulders
,
the
sand
*NL*
reaches
to
his
throat
;
only
his
face
is
visible
now
.
His
mouth
cries
*NL*
aloud
,
the
sand
fills
it
;
silence
.
His
eyes
still
gaze
forth
,
the
sand
*NL*
closes
them
,
night
.
Then
his
brow
decreases
,
a
little
hair
quivers
above
*NL*
the
sand
;
a
hand
projects
,
pierces
the
surface
of
the
beach
,
waves
and
*NL*
disappears
.
Sinister
obliteration
of
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sometimes
a
rider
is
engulfed
with
his
horse
;
sometimes
the
carter
is
*NL*
swallowed
up
with
his
cart
;
all
founders
in
that
strand
.
It
is
shipwreck
*NL*
elsewhere
than
in
the
water
.
It
is
the
earth
drowning
a
man
.
The
earth
,
*NL*
permeated
with
the
ocean
,
becomes
a
pitfall
.
It
presents
itself
in
the
*NL*
guise
of
a
plain
,
and
it
yawns
like
a
wave
.
The
abyss
is
subject
to
*NL*
these
treacheries
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
melancholy
fate
,
always
possible
on
certain
sea
beaches
,
was
also
*NL*
possible
,
thirty
years
ago
,
in
the
sewers
of
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
important
works
,
undertaken
in
1833
,
the
subterranean
drain
*NL*
of
Paris
was
subject
to
these
sudden
slides
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
filtered
into
certain
subjacent
strata
,
which
were
*NL*
particularly
friable
;
the
foot-way
,
which
was
of
flag-stones
,
as
in
*NL*
the
ancient
sewers
,
or
of
cement
on
concrete
,
as
in
the
new
galleries
,
*NL*
having
no
longer
an
underpinning
,
gave
way
.
A
fold
in
a
flooring
of
this
*NL*
sort
means
a
crack
,
means
crumbling
.
The
framework
crumbled
away
for
a
*NL*
certain
length
.
This
crevice
,
the
hiatus
of
a
gulf
of
mire
,
was
called
a
*NL*
fontis
,
in
the
special
tongue
.
What
is
a
fontis
?
It
is
the
quicksands
of
*NL*
the
seashore
suddenly
encountered
under
the
surface
of
the
earth
;
it
is
*NL*
the
beach
of
Mont
Saint-Michel
in
a
sewer
.
The
soaked
soil
is
in
a
*NL*
state
of
fusion
,
as
it
were
;
all
its
molecules
are
in
suspension
in
soft
*NL*
medium
;
it
is
not
earth
and
it
is
not
water
.
The
depth
is
sometimes
very
*NL*
great
.
Nothing
can
be
more
formidable
than
such
an
encounter
.
If
the
*NL*
water
predominates
,
death
is
prompt
,
the
man
is
swallowed
up
;
if
earth
*NL*
predominates
,
death
is
slow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Can
any
one
picture
to
himself
such
a
death
?
If
being
swallowed
by
the
*NL*
earth
is
terrible
on
the
seashore
,
what
is
it
in
a
cess-pool
?
Instead
of
*NL*
the
open
air
,
the
broad
daylight
,
the
clear
horizon
,
those
vast
sounds
,
*NL*
those
free
clouds
whence
rains
life
,
instead
of
those
barks
descried
*NL*
in
the
distance
,
of
that
hope
under
all
sorts
of
forms
,
of
probable
*NL*
passers-by
,
of
succor
possible
up
to
the
very
last
moment
,
--
instead
*NL*
of
all
this
,
deafness
,
blindness
,
a
black
vault
,
the
inside
of
a
tomb
*NL*
already
prepared
,
death
in
the
mire
beneath
a
cover
!
slow
suffocation
*NL*
by
filth
,
a
stone
box
where
asphyxia
opens
its
claw
in
the
mire
and
*NL*
clutches
you
by
the
throat
;
fetidness
mingled
with
the
death-rattle
;
*NL*
slime
instead
of
the
strand
,
sulfuretted
hydrogen
in
place
of
the
*NL*
hurricane
,
dung
in
place
of
the
ocean
!
And
to
shout
,
to
gnash
one
's
*NL*
teeth
,
and
to
writhe
,
and
to
struggle
,
and
to
agonize
,
with
that
*NL*
enormous
city
which
knows
nothing
of
it
all
,
over
one
's
head
!
*NL*
*NL*
Inexpressible
is
the
horror
of
dying
thus
!
Death
sometimes
redeems
*NL*
his
atrocity
by
a
certain
terrible
dignity
.
On
the
funeral
pile
,
in
*NL*
shipwreck
,
one
can
be
great
;
in
the
flames
as
in
the
foam
,
a
superb
*NL*
attitude
is
possible
;
one
there
becomes
transfigured
as
one
perishes
.
*NL*
But
not
here
.
Death
is
filthy
.
It
is
humiliating
to
expire
.
The
supreme
*NL*
floating
visions
are
abject
.
Mud
is
synonymous
with
shame
.
It
is
*NL*
petty
,
ugly
,
infamous
.
To
die
in
a
butt
of
Malvoisie
,
like
Clarence
,
is
*NL*
permissible
;
in
the
ditch
of
a
scavenger
,
like
Escoubleau
,
is
horrible
.
*NL*
To
struggle
therein
is
hideous
;
at
the
same
time
that
one
is
going
*NL*
through
the
death
agony
,
one
is
floundering
about
.
There
are
shadows
*NL*
enough
for
hell
,
and
mire
enough
to
render
it
nothing
but
a
slough
,
and
*NL*
the
dying
man
knows
not
whether
he
is
on
the
point
of
becoming
a
spectre
*NL*
or
a
frog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
else
the
sepulchre
is
sinister
;
here
it
is
deformed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
depth
of
the
fontis
varied
,
as
well
as
their
length
and
their
*NL*
density
,
according
to
the
more
or
less
bad
quality
of
the
sub-soil
.
*NL*
Sometimes
a
fontis
was
three
or
four
feet
deep
,
sometimes
eight
or
ten
;
*NL*
sometimes
the
bottom
was
unfathomable
.
Here
the
mire
was
almost
solid
,
*NL*
there
almost
liquid
.
In
the
Luniere
fontis
,
it
would
have
taken
a
man
a
*NL*
day
to
disappear
,
while
he
would
have
been
devoured
in
five
minutes
by
*NL*
the
Philippeaux
slough
.
The
mire
bears
up
more
or
less
,
according
to
its
*NL*
density
.
A
child
can
escape
where
a
man
will
perish
.
The
first
law
of
*NL*
safety
is
to
get
rid
of
every
sort
of
load
.
Every
sewerman
who
felt
the
*NL*
ground
giving
way
beneath
him
began
by
flinging
away
his
sack
of
tools
,
*NL*
or
his
back-basket
,
or
his
hod
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fontis
were
due
to
different
causes
:
the
friability
of
the
soil
;
*NL*
some
landslip
at
a
depth
beyond
the
reach
of
man
;
the
violent
summer
*NL*
rains
;
the
incessant
flooding
of
winter
;
long
,
drizzling
showers
.
*NL*
Sometimes
the
weight
of
the
surrounding
houses
on
a
marly
or
sandy
soil
*NL*
forced
out
the
vaults
of
the
subterranean
galleries
and
caused
them
to
*NL*
bend
aside
,
or
it
chanced
that
a
flooring
vault
burst
and
split
under
*NL*
this
crushing
thrust
.
In
this
manner
,
the
heaping
up
of
the
Parthenon
,
*NL*
obliterated
,
a
century
ago
,
a
portion
of
the
vaults
of
Saint-Genevieve
*NL*
hill
.
When
a
sewer
was
broken
in
under
the
pressure
of
the
houses
,
the
*NL*
mischief
was
sometimes
betrayed
in
the
street
above
by
a
sort
of
space
,
*NL*
like
the
teeth
of
a
saw
,
between
the
paving-stones
;
this
crevice
was
*NL*
developed
in
an
undulating
line
throughout
the
entire
length
of
the
*NL*
cracked
vault
,
and
then
,
the
evil
being
visible
,
the
remedy
could
be
*NL*
promptly
applied
.
It
also
frequently
happened
,
that
the
interior
ravages
*NL*
were
not
revealed
by
any
external
scar
,
and
in
that
case
,
woe
to
the
*NL*
sewermen
.
When
they
entered
without
precaution
into
the
sewer
,
they
were
*NL*
liable
to
be
lost
.
Ancient
registers
make
mention
of
several
scavengers
*NL*
who
were
buried
in
fontis
in
this
manner
.
They
give
many
names
;
among
*NL*
others
,
that
of
the
sewerman
who
was
swallowed
up
in
a
quagmire
under
*NL*
the
man-hole
of
the
Rue
Careme-Prenant
,
a
certain
Blaise
Poutrain
;
this
*NL*
Blaise
Poutrain
was
the
brother
of
Nicholas
Poutrain
,
who
was
the
last
*NL*
grave-digger
of
the
cemetery
called
the
Charnier
des
Innocents
,
in
1785
,
*NL*
the
epoch
when
that
cemetery
expired
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
also
that
young
and
charming
Vicomte
d'Escoubleau
,
of
whom
we
*NL*
have
just
spoken
,
one
of
the
heroes
of
the
siege
of
Lerida
,
where
they
*NL*
delivered
the
assault
in
silk
stockings
,
with
violins
at
their
head
.
*NL*
D'Escoubleau
,
surprised
one
night
at
his
cousin
's
,
the
Duchess
de
*NL*
Sourdis
'
,
was
drowned
in
a
quagmire
of
the
Beautreillis
sewer
,
in
which
*NL*
he
had
taken
refuge
in
order
to
escape
from
the
Duke
.
Madame
de
Sourdis
,
*NL*
when
informed
of
his
death
,
demanded
her
smelling-bottle
,
and
forgot
to
*NL*
weep
,
through
sniffling
at
her
salts
.
In
such
cases
,
there
is
no
love
*NL*
which
holds
fast
;
the
sewer
extinguishes
it
.
Hero
refuses
to
wash
the

body
of

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
FONTIS
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
a
fontis
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sort
of
quagmire
was
common
at
that
period
in
the
subsoil
of
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysees
,
difficult
to
handle
in
the
hydraulic
works
and
a
bad
*NL*
preservative
of
the
subterranean
constructions
,
on
account
of
its
*NL*
excessive
fluidity
.
This
fluidity
exceeds
even
the
inconsistency
of
the
*NL*
sands
of
the
Quartier
Saint-Georges
,
which
could
only
be
conquered
by
*NL*
a
stone
construction
on
a
concrete
foundation
,
and
the
clayey
strata
,
*NL*
infected
with
gas
,
of
the
Quartier
des
Martyrs
,
which
are
so
liquid
*NL*
that
the
only
way
in
which
a
passage
was
effected
under
the
gallery
des
*NL*
Martyrs
was
by
means
of
a
cast-iron
pipe
.
When
,
in
1836
,
the
old
stone
*NL*
sewer
beneath
the
Faubourg
Saint-Honore
,
in
which
we
now
see
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
was
demolished
for
the
purpose
of
reconstructing
it
,
the
*NL*
quicksand
,
which
forms
the
subsoil
of
the
Champs-Elysees
as
far
as
the
*NL*
Seine
,
presented
such
an
obstacle
,
that
the
operation
lasted
nearly
*NL*
six
months
,
to
the
great
clamor
of
the
dwellers
on
the
riverside
,
*NL*
particularly
those
who
had
hotels
and
carriages
.
The
work
was
more
than
*NL*
unhealthy
;
it
was
dangerous
.
It
is
true
that
they
had
four
months
and
a
*NL*
half
of
rain
,
and
three
floods
of
the
Seine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fontis
which
Jean
Valjean
had
encountered
was
caused
by
the
downpour
*NL*
of
the
preceding
day
.
The
pavement
,
badly
sustained
by
the
subjacent
*NL*
sand
,
had
given
way
and
had
produced
a
stoppage
of
the
water
.
*NL*
Infiltration
had
taken
place
,
a
slip
had
followed
.
The
dislocated
bottom
*NL*
had
sunk
into
the
ooze
.
To
what
extent
?
Impossible
to
say
.
The
obscurity
*NL*
was
more
dense
there
than
elsewhere
.
It
was
a
pit
of
mire
in
a
cavern
of
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
felt
the
pavement
vanishing
beneath
his
feet
.
He
entered
*NL*
this
slime
.
There
was
water
on
the
surface
,
slime
at
the
bottom
.
He
must
*NL*
pass
it
.
To
retrace
his
steps
was
impossible
.
Marius
was
dying
,
and
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
exhausted
.
Besides
,
where
was
he
to
go
?
Jean
Valjean
advanced
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
pit
seemed
,
for
the
first
few
steps
,
not
to
be
very
deep
.
*NL*
But
in
proportion
as
he
advanced
,
his
feet
plunged
deeper
.
Soon
he
had
*NL*
the
slime
up
to
his
calves
and
water
above
his
knees
.
He
walked
on
,
*NL*
raising
Marius
in
his
arms
,
as
far
above
the
water
as
he
could
.
The
mire
*NL*
now
reached
to
his
knees
,
and
the
water
to
his
waist
.
He
could
no
longer
*NL*
retreat
.
This
mud
,
dense
enough
for
one
man
,
could
not
,
obviously
,
*NL*
uphold
two
.
Marius
and
Jean
Valjean
would
have
stood
a
chance
of
*NL*
extricating
themselves
singly
.
Jean
Valjean
continued
to
advance
,
*NL*
supporting
the
dying
man
,
who
was
,
perhaps
,
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
water
came
up
to
his
arm-pits
;
he
felt
that
he
was
sinking
;
it
was
*NL*
only
with
difficulty
that
he
could
move
in
the
depth
of
ooze
which
*NL*
he
had
now
reached
.
The
density
,
which
was
his
support
,
was
also
*NL*
an
obstacle
.
He
still
held
Marius
on
high
,
and
with
an
unheard-of
*NL*
expenditure
of
force
,
he
advanced
still
;
but
he
was
sinking
.
He
had
only
*NL*
his
head
above
the
water
now
and
his
two
arms
holding
up
Marius
.
In
the
*NL*
old
paintings
of
the
deluge
there
is
a
mother
holding
her
child
thus
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sank
still
deeper
,
he
turned
his
face
to
the
rear
,
to
escape
the
*NL*
water
,
and
in
order
that
he
might
be
able
to
breathe
;
anyone
who
had
*NL*
seen
him
in
that
gloom
would
have
thought
that
what
he
beheld
was
a
*NL*
mask
floating
on
the
shadows
;
he
caught
a
faint
glimpse
above
him
of
the
*NL*
drooping
head
and
livid
face
of
Marius
;
he
made
a
desperate
effort
and
*NL*
launched
his
foot
forward
;
his
foot
struck
something
solid
;
a
point
of
*NL*
support
.
It
was
high
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
straightened
himself
up
,
and
rooted
himself
upon
that
point
of
*NL*
support
with
a
sort
of
fury
.
This
produced
upon
him
the
effect
of
the
*NL*
first
step
in
a
staircase
leading
back
to
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
of
support
,
thus
encountered
in
the
mire
at
the
supreme
*NL*
moment
,
was
the
beginning
of
the
other
water-shed
of
the
pavement
,
which
*NL*
had
bent
but
had
not
given
way
,
and
which
had
curved
under
the
water
*NL*
like
a
plank
and
in
a
single
piece
.
Well
built
pavements
form
a
vault
*NL*
and
possess
this
sort
of
firmness
.
This
fragment
of
the
vaulting
,
partly
*NL*
submerged
,
but
solid
,
was
a
veritable
inclined
plane
,
and
,
once
on
this
*NL*
plane
,
he
was
safe
.
Jean
Valjean
mounted
this
inclined
plane
and
reached
*NL*
the
other
side
of
the
quagmire
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
emerged
from
the
water
,
he
came
in
contact
with
a
stone
and
fell
*NL*
upon
his
knees
.
He
reflected
that
this
was
but
just
,
and
he
remained
*NL*
there
for
some
time
,
with
his
soul
absorbed
in
words
addressed
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
rose
to
his
feet
,
shivering
,
chilled
,
foul-smelling
,
bowed
beneath
*NL*
the
dying
man
whom
he
was
dragging
after
him
,
all
dripping
with
slime
,
*NL*
and
his
soul
filled
with
a
strange
light
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
ONE
SOMETIMES
RUNS
AGROUND
WHEN
ONE
FANCIES
THAT
ONE
IS
*NL*
DISEMBARKING
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
out
on
his
way
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
although
he
had
not
left
his
life
in
the
fontis
,
he
seemed
*NL*
to
have
left
his
strength
behind
him
there
.
That
supreme
effort
had
*NL*
exhausted
him
.
His
lassitude
was
now
such
that
he
was
obliged
to
pause
*NL*
for
breath
every
three
or
four
steps
,
and
lean
against
the
wall
.
Once
*NL*
he
was
forced
to
seat
himself
on
the
banquette
in
order
to
alter
Marius
'
*NL*
position
,
and
he
thought
that
he
should
have
to
remain
there
.
But
if
his
*NL*
vigor
was
dead
,
his
energy
was
not
.
He
rose
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
on
desperately
,
almost
fast
,
proceeded
thus
for
a
hundred
*NL*
paces
,
almost
without
drawing
breath
,
and
suddenly
came
in
contact
with
*NL*
the
wall
.
He
had
reached
an
elbow
of
the
sewer
,
and
,
arriving
at
the
*NL*
turn
with
head
bent
down
,
he
had
struck
the
wall
.
He
raised
his
eyes
,
*NL*
and
at
the
extremity
of
the
vault
,
far
,
very
far
away
in
front
of
him
,
*NL*
he
perceived
a
light
.
This
time
it
was
not
that
terrible
light
;
it
was
*NL*
good
,
white
light
.
It
was
daylight
.
Jean
Valjean
saw
the
outlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
damned
soul
,
who
,
in
the
midst
of
the
furnace
,
should
suddenly
*NL*
perceive
the
outlet
of
Gehenna
,
would
experience
what
Jean
Valjean
felt
.
*NL*
It
would
fly
wildly
with
the
stumps
of
its
burned
wings
towards
that
*NL*
radiant
portal
.
Jean
Valjean
was
no
longer
conscious
of
fatigue
,
he
no
*NL*
longer
felt
Marius
'
weight
,
he
found
his
legs
once
more
of
steel
,
he
ran
*NL*
rather
than
walked
.
As
he
approached
,
the
outlet
became
more
and
more
*NL*
distinctly
defined
.
It
was
a
pointed
arch
,
lower
than
the
vault
,
which
*NL*
gradually
narrowed
,
and
narrower
than
the
gallery
,
which
closed
in
as
*NL*
the
vault
grew
lower
.
The
tunnel
ended
like
the
interior
of
a
funnel
;
*NL*
a
faulty
construction
,
imitated
from
the
wickets
of
penitentiaries
,
*NL*
logical
in
a
prison
,
illogical
in
a
sewer
,
and
which
has
since
been
*NL*
corrected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
reached
the
outlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
was
the
outlet
,
but
he
could
not
get
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arch
was
closed
by
a
heavy
grating
,
and
the
grating
,
which
,
to
all
*NL*
appearance
,
rarely
swung
on
its
rusty
hinges
,
was
clamped
to
its
stone
*NL*
jamb
by
a
thick
lock
,
which
,
red
with
rust
,
seemed
like
an
enormous
*NL*
brick
.
The
keyhole
could
be
seen
,
and
the
robust
latch
,
deeply
sunk
in
*NL*
the
iron
staple
.
The
door
was
plainly
double-locked
.
It
was
one
of
those
*NL*
prison
locks
which
old
Paris
was
so
fond
of
lavishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
the
grating
was
the
open
air
,
the
river
,
the
daylight
,
the
shore
,
*NL*
very
narrow
but
sufficient
for
escape
.
The
distant
quays
,
Paris
,
that
*NL*
gulf
in
which
one
so
easily
hides
oneself
,
the
broad
horizon
,
liberty
.
*NL*
On
the
right
,
down
stream
,
the
bridge
of
Jena
was
discernible
,
on
the
*NL*
left
,
upstream
,
the
bridge
of
the
Invalides
;
the
place
would
have
been
a
*NL*
propitious
one
in
which
to
await
the
night
and
to
escape
.
It
was
one
*NL*
of
the
most
solitary
points
in
Paris
;
the
shore
which
faces
the
*NL*
Grand-Caillou
.
Flies
were
entering
and
emerging
through
the
bars
of
the
*NL*
grating
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
half-past
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
The
day
was
*NL*
declining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
laid
Marius
down
along
the
wall
,
on
the
dry
portion
of
the
*NL*
vaulting
,
then
he
went
to
the
grating
and
clenched
both
fists
round
the
*NL*
bars
;
the
shock
which
he
gave
it
was
frenzied
,
but
it
did
not
move
.
The
*NL*
grating
did
not
stir
.
Jean
Valjean
seized
the
bars
one
after
the
other
,
*NL*
in
the
hope
that
he
might
be
able
to
tear
away
the
least
solid
,
and
to
*NL*
make
of
it
a
lever
wherewith
to
raise
the
door
or
to
break
the
lock
.
Not
*NL*
a
bar
stirred
.
The
teeth
of
a
tiger
are
not
more
firmly
fixed
in
their
*NL*
sockets
.
No
lever
;
no
prying
possible
.
The
obstacle
was
invincible
.
*NL*
There
was
no
means
of
opening
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Must
he
then
stop
there
?
What
was
he
to
do
?
What
was
to
become
of
him
?
*NL*
He
had
not
the
strength
to
retrace
his
steps
,
to
recommence
the
journey
*NL*
which
he
had
already
taken
.
Besides
,
how
was
he
to
again
traverse
that
*NL*
quagmire
whence
he
had
only
extricated
himself
as
by
a
miracle
?
And
*NL*
after
the
quagmire
,
was
there
not
the
police
patrol
,
which
assuredly
*NL*
could
not
be
twice
avoided
?
And
then
,
whither
was
he
to
go
?
What
*NL*
direction
should
he
pursue
?
To
follow
the
incline
would
not
conduct
*NL*
him
to
his
goal
.
If
he
were
to
reach
another
outlet
,
he
would
find
it
*NL*
obstructed
by
a
plug
or
a
grating
.
Every
outlet
was
,
undoubtedly
,
closed
*NL*
in
that
manner
.
Chance
had
unsealed
the
grating
through
which
he
had
*NL*
entered
,
but
it
was
evident
that
all
the
other
sewer
mouths
were
barred
.
*NL*
He
had
only
succeeded
in
escaping
into
a
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
over
.
Everything
that
Jean
Valjean
had
done
was
useless
.
*NL*
Exhaustion
had
ended
in
failure
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
both
caught
in
the
immense
and
gloomy
web
of
death
,
and
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
felt
the
terrible
spider
running
along
those
black
strands
and
*NL*
quivering
in
the
shadows
.
He
turned
his
back
to
the
grating
,
and
fell
*NL*
upon
the
pavement
,
hurled
to
earth
rather
than
seated
,
close
to
Marius
,
*NL*
who
still
made
no
movement
,
and
with
his
head
bent
between
his
knees
.
*NL*
This
was
the
last
drop
of
anguish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
what
was
he
thinking
during
this
profound
depression
?
Neither
of
*NL*
himself
nor
of
Marius
.
He
was
thinking
of
Cosette
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
THE
TORN
COAT-TAIL
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
this
prostration
,
a
hand
was
laid
on
his
shoulder
,
and
a
*NL*
low
voice
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Half
shares
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
person
in
that
gloom
?
Nothing
so
closely
resembles
a
dream
as
*NL*
despair
.
Jean
Valjean
thought
that
he
was
dreaming
.
He
had
heard
no
*NL*
footsteps
.
Was
it
possible
?
He
raised
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
stood
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
was
clad
in
a
blouse
;
his
feet
were
bare
;
he
held
his
shoes
*NL*
in
his
left
hand
;
he
had
evidently
removed
them
in
order
to
reach
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
without
allowing
his
steps
to
be
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
did
not
hesitate
for
an
instant
.
Unexpected
as
was
this
*NL*
encounter
,
this
man
was
known
to
him
.
The
man
was
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
awakened
,
so
to
speak
,
with
a
start
,
Jean
Valjean
,
accustomed
*NL*
to
alarms
,
and
steeled
to
unforeseen
shocks
that
must
be
promptly
*NL*
parried
,
instantly
regained
possession
of
his
presence
of
mind
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
situation
could
not
be
made
worse
,
a
certain
degree
of
*NL*
distress
is
no
longer
capable
of
a
crescendo
,
and
Thenardier
himself
*NL*
could
add
nothing
to
this
blackness
of
this
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
momentary
pause
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
raising
his
right
hand
to
a
level
with
his
forehead
,
formed
*NL*
with
it
a
shade
,
then
he
brought
his
eyelashes
together
,
by
screwing
up
*NL*
his
eyes
,
a
motion
which
,
in
connection
with
a
slight
contraction
of
the
*NL*
mouth
,
characterizes
the
sagacious
attention
of
a
man
who
is
endeavoring
*NL*
to
recognize
another
man
.
He
did
not
succeed
.
Jean
Valjean
,
as
we
have
*NL*
just
stated
,
had
his
back
turned
to
the
light
,
and
he
was
,
moreover
,
*NL*
so
disfigured
,
so
bemired
,
so
bleeding
that
he
would
have
been
*NL*
unrecognizable
in
full
noonday
.
On
the
contrary
,
illuminated
by
the
*NL*
light
from
the
grating
,
a
cellar
light
,
it
is
true
,
livid
,
yet
precise
*NL*
in
its
lividness
,
Thenardier
,
as
the
energetic
popular
metaphor
*NL*
expresses
it
,
immediately
``
leaped
into
''
Jean
Valjean
's
eyes
.
This
*NL*
inequality
of
conditions
sufficed
to
assure
some
advantage
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
in
that
mysterious
duel
which
was
on
the
point
of
beginning
*NL*
between
the
two
situations
and
the
two
men
.
The
encounter
took
place
*NL*
between
Jean
Valjean
veiled
and
Thenardier
unmasked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
immediately
perceived
that
Thenardier
did
not
recognize
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
surveyed
each
other
for
a
moment
in
that
half-gloom
,
as
though
*NL*
taking
each
other
's
measure
.
Thenardier
was
the
first
to
break
the
*NL*
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
going
to
manage
to
get
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
made
no
reply
.
Thenardier
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
impossible
to
pick
the
lock
of
that
gate
.
But
still
you
must
get
*NL*
out
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
true
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
half
shares
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
by
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
killed
that
man
;
that
's
all
right
.
I
have
the
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
pointed
to
Marius
.
He
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
you
,
but
I
want
to
help
you
.
You
must
be
a
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
began
to
comprehend
.
Thenardier
took
him
for
an
assassin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Listen
,
comrade
.
You
did
n't
kill
that
man
without
looking
to
see
what
*NL*
he
had
in
his
pockets
.
Give
me
my
half
.
I
'll
open
the
door
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
half
drawing
from
beneath
his
tattered
blouse
a
huge
key
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
see
how
a
key
to
liberty
is
made
?
Look
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
``
remained
stupid
''
--
the
expression
belongs
to
the
elder
*NL*
Corneille
--
to
such
a
degree
that
he
doubted
whether
what
he
beheld
was
*NL*
real
.
It
was
providence
appearing
in
horrible
guise
,
and
his
good
angel
*NL*
springing
from
the
earth
in
the
form
of
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
thrust
his
fist
into
a
large
pocket
concealed
under
his
*NL*
blouse
,
drew
out
a
rope
and
offered
it
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
'll
give
you
the
rope
to
boot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
rope
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
need
a
stone
also
,
but
you
can
find
one
outside
.
There
's
a
*NL*
heap
of
rubbish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
do
with
a
stone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Idiot
,
you
'll
want
to
sling
that
stiff
into
the
river
,
you
'll
need
a
*NL*
stone
and
a
rope
,
otherwise
it
would
float
on
the
water
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
took
the
rope
.
There
is
no
one
who
does
not
occasionally
*NL*
accept
in
this
mechanical
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
snapped
his
fingers
as
though
an
idea
had
suddenly
occurred
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
see
here
,
comrade
,
how
did
you
contrive
to
get
out
of
that
slough
*NL*
yonder
?
I
have
n't
dared
to
risk
myself
in
it
.
Phew
!
you
do
n't
smell
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
pause
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
asking
you
questions
,
but
you
're
perfectly
right
not
to
answer
.
*NL*
It
's
an
apprenticeship
against
that
cursed
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
*NL*
examining
magistrate
.
And
then
,
when
you
do
n't
talk
at
all
,
you
run
no
*NL*
risk
of
talking
too
loud
.
That
's
no
matter
,
as
I
ca
n't
see
your
face
and
*NL*
as
I
do
n't
know
your
name
,
you
are
wrong
in
supposing
that
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
who
you
are
and
what
you
want
.
I
twig
.
You
've
broken
up
that
gentleman
*NL*
a
bit
;
now
you
want
to
tuck
him
away
somewhere
.
The
river
,
that
great
*NL*
hider
of
folly
,
is
what
you
want
.
I
'll
get
you
out
of
your
scrape
.
*NL*
Helping
a
good
fellow
in
a
pinch
is
what
suits
me
to
a
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
expressing
his
approval
of
Jean
Valjean
's
silence
,
he
endeavored
*NL*
to
force
him
to
talk
.
He
jostled
his
shoulder
in
an
attempt
to
catch
a
*NL*
sight
of
his
profile
,
and
he
exclaimed
,
without
,
however
,
raising
his
*NL*
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apropos
of
that
quagmire
,
you
're
a
hearty
animal
.
Why
did
n't
you
toss
*NL*
the
man
in
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
preserved
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
resumed
,
pushing
the
rag
which
served
him
as
a
cravat
to
the
*NL*
level
of
his
Adam
's
apple
,
a
gesture
which
completes
the
capable
air
of
*NL*
a
serious
man
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
you
acted
wisely
.
The
workmen
,
when
they
come
to-morrow
to
*NL*
stop
up
that
hole
,
would
certainly
have
found
the
stiff
abandoned
there
,
*NL*
and
it
might
have
been
possible
,
thread
by
thread
,
straw
by
straw
,
to
*NL*
pick
up
the
scent
and
reach
you
.
Some
one
has
passed
through
the
sewer
.
*NL*
Who
?
Where
did
he
get
out
?
Was
he
seen
to
come
out
?
The
police
are
full
*NL*
of
cleverness
.
The
sewer
is
treacherous
and
tells
tales
of
you
.
Such
a
*NL*
find
is
a
rarity
,
it
attracts
attention
,
very
few
people
make
use
of
*NL*
the
sewers
for
their
affairs
,
while
the
river
belongs
to
everybody
.
The
*NL*
river
is
the
true
grave
.
At
the
end
of
a
month
they
fish
up
your
man
*NL*
in
the
nets
at
Saint-Cloud
.
Well
,
what
does
one
care
for
that
?
It
's
*NL*
carrion
!
Who
killed
that
man
?
Paris
.
And
justice
makes
no
inquiries
.
You
*NL*
have
done
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
more
loquacious
Thenardier
became
,
the
more
mute
was
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Thenardier
shook
him
by
the
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
's
settle
this
business
.
Let
's
go
shares
.
You
have
seen
my
key
,
*NL*
show
me
your
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
haggard
,
fierce
,
suspicious
,
rather
menacing
,
yet
*NL*
amicable
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
singular
circumstance
;
Thenardier
's
manners
were
not
*NL*
simple
;
he
had
not
the
air
of
being
wholly
at
his
ease
;
while
affecting
*NL*
an
air
of
mystery
,
he
spoke
low
;
from
time
to
time
he
laid
his
finger
on
*NL*
his
mouth
,
and
muttered
,
``
hush
!
''
It
was
difficult
to
divine
why
.
There
*NL*
was
no
one
there
except
themselves
.
Jean
Valjean
thought
that
other
*NL*
ruffians
might
possibly
be
concealed
in
some
nook
,
not
very
far
off
,
and
*NL*
that
Thenardier
did
not
care
to
share
with
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
settle
up
.
How
much
did
the
stiff
have
in
his
bags
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
searched
his
pockets
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
his
habit
,
as
the
reader
will
remember
,
to
always
have
some
*NL*
money
about
him
.
The
mournful
life
of
expedients
to
which
he
had
been
*NL*
condemned
imposed
this
as
a
law
upon
him
.
On
this
occasion
,
however
,
*NL*
he
had
been
caught
unprepared
.
When
donning
his
uniform
of
a
National
*NL*
Guardsman
on
the
preceding
evening
,
he
had
forgotten
,
dolefully
absorbed
*NL*
as
he
was
,
to
take
his
pocket-book
.
He
had
only
some
small
change
in
his
*NL*
fob
.
He
turned
out
his
pocket
,
all
soaked
with
ooze
,
and
spread
out
on
*NL*
the
banquette
of
the
vault
one
louis
d'or
,
two
five-franc
pieces
,
and
*NL*
five
or
six
large
sous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
thrust
out
his
lower
lip
with
a
significant
twist
of
the
*NL*
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
knocked
him
over
cheap
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
to
feeling
the
pockets
of
Jean
Valjean
and
Marius
,
with
the
*NL*
greatest
familiarity
.
Jean
Valjean
,
who
was
chiefly
concerned
in
keeping
*NL*
his
back
to
the
light
,
let
him
have
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
handling
Marius
'
coat
,
Thenardier
,
with
the
skill
of
a
pickpocket
,
*NL*
and
without
being
noticed
by
Jean
Valjean
,
tore
off
a
strip
which
he
*NL*
concealed
under
his
blouse
,
probably
thinking
that
this
morsel
of
*NL*
stuff
might
serve
,
later
on
,
to
identify
the
assassinated
man
and
the
*NL*
assassin
.
However
,
he
found
no
more
than
the
thirty
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
,
''
said
he
,
``
both
of
you
together
have
no
more
than
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
forgetting
his
motto
:
``
half
shares
,
''
he
took
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hesitated
a
little
over
the
large
sous
.
After
due
reflection
,
he
took
*NL*
them
also
,
muttering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
!
You
cut
folks
'
throats
too
cheap
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
he
once
more
drew
the
big
key
from
under
his
blouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
friend
,
you
must
leave
.
It
's
like
the
fair
here
,
you
pay
when
*NL*
you
go
out
.
You
have
paid
,
now
clear
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
,
in
lending
to
this
stranger
the
aid
of
his
key
,
and
in
making
*NL*
some
other
man
than
himself
emerge
from
that
portal
,
the
pure
and
*NL*
disinterested
intention
of
rescuing
an
assassin
?
We
may
be
permitted
to
*NL*
doubt
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
helped
Jean
Valjean
to
replace
Marius
on
his
shoulders
,
then
*NL*
he
betook
himself
to
the
grating
on
tiptoe
,
and
barefooted
,
making
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
a
sign
to
follow
him
,
looked
out
,
laid
his
finger
on
his
mouth
,
*NL*
and
remained
for
several
seconds
,
as
though
in
suspense
;
his
inspection
*NL*
finished
,
he
placed
the
key
in
the
lock
.
The
bolt
slipped
back
and
the
*NL*
gate
swung
open
.
It
neither
grated
nor
squeaked
.
It
moved
very
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
obvious
that
this
gate
and
those
hinges
,
carefully
oiled
,
were
*NL*
in
the
habit
of
opening
more
frequently
than
was
supposed
.
This
*NL*
softness
was
suspicious
;
it
hinted
at
furtive
goings
and
comings
,
silent
*NL*
entrances
and
exits
of
nocturnal
men
,
and
the
wolf-like
tread
of
crime
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sewer
was
evidently
an
accomplice
of
some
mysterious
band
.
This
*NL*
taciturn
grating
was
a
receiver
of
stolen
goods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
opened
the
gate
a
little
way
,
allowing
just
sufficient
space
*NL*
for
Jean
Valjean
to
pass
out
,
closed
the
grating
again
,
gave
the
key
*NL*
a
double
turn
in
the
lock
and
plunged
back
into
the
darkness
,
without
*NL*
making
any
more
noise
than
a
breath
.
He
seemed
to
walk
with
the
velvet
*NL*
paws
of
a
tiger
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
that
hideous
providence
had
retreated
into
the
*NL*
invisibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
found
himself
in
the
open
air
.

CHAPTER
IX
--
MARIUS
PRODUCES
ON
SOME
ONE
WHO
IS
A
JUDGE
OF
THE
MATTER
,
*NL*
THE
EFFECT
OF
BEING
DEAD
*NL*
*NL*
He
allowed
Marius
to
slide
down
upon
the
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
the
open
air
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
miasmas
,
darkness
,
horror
lay
behind
him
.
The
pure
,
healthful
,
*NL*
living
,
joyous
air
that
was
easy
to
breathe
inundated
him
.
Everywhere
*NL*
around
him
reigned
silence
,
but
that
charming
silence
when
the
sun
has
*NL*
set
in
an
unclouded
azure
sky
.
Twilight
had
descended
;
night
was
drawing
*NL*
on
,
the
great
deliverer
,
the
friend
of
all
those
who
need
a
mantle
of
*NL*
darkness
that
they
may
escape
from
an
anguish
.
The
sky
presented
itself
*NL*
in
all
directions
like
an
enormous
calm
.
The
river
flowed
to
his
feet
*NL*
with
the
sound
of
a
kiss
.
The
aerial
dialogue
of
the
nests
bidding
each
*NL*
other
good
night
in
the
elms
of
the
Champs-Elysees
was
audible
.
A
few
*NL*
stars
,
daintily
piercing
the
pale
blue
of
the
zenith
,
and
visible
to
*NL*
revery
alone
,
formed
imperceptible
little
splendors
amid
the
immensity
.
*NL*
Evening
was
unfolding
over
the
head
of
Jean
Valjean
all
the
sweetness
of
*NL*
the
infinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
that
exquisite
and
undecided
hour
which
says
neither
yes
nor
no
.
*NL*
Night
was
already
sufficiently
advanced
to
render
it
possible
to
lose
*NL*
oneself
at
a
little
distance
and
yet
there
was
sufficient
daylight
to
*NL*
permit
of
recognition
at
close
quarters
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
seconds
,
Jean
Valjean
was
irresistibly
overcome
by
that
*NL*
august
and
caressing
serenity
;
such
moments
of
oblivion
do
come
to
men
;
*NL*
suffering
refrains
from
harassing
the
unhappy
wretch
;
everything
is
*NL*
eclipsed
in
the
thoughts
;
peace
broods
over
the
dreamer
like
night
;
and
,
*NL*
beneath
the
twilight
which
beams
and
in
imitation
of
the
sky
which
is
*NL*
illuminated
,
the
soul
becomes
studded
with
stars
.
Jean
Valjean
could
*NL*
not
refrain
from
contemplating
that
vast
,
clear
shadow
which
rested
*NL*
over
him
;
thoughtfully
he
bathed
in
the
sea
of
ecstasy
and
prayer
in
the
*NL*
majestic
silence
of
the
eternal
heavens
.
Then
he
bent
down
swiftly
*NL*
to
Marius
,
as
though
the
sentiment
of
duty
had
returned
to
him
,
and
,
*NL*
dipping
up
water
in
the
hollow
of
his
hand
,
he
gently
sprinkled
a
*NL*
few
drops
on
the
latter
's
face
.
Marius
'
eyelids
did
not
open
;
but
his
*NL*
half-open
mouth
still
breathed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
on
the
point
of
dipping
his
hand
in
the
river
once
*NL*
more
,
when
,
all
at
once
,
he
experienced
an
indescribable
embarrassment
,
*NL*
such
as
a
person
feels
when
there
is
some
one
behind
him
whom
he
does
*NL*
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
already
alluded
to
this
impression
,
with
which
everyone
is
*NL*
familiar
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
was
,
in
fact
,
behind
him
,
as
there
had
been
a
short
while
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
of
lofty
stature
,
enveloped
in
a
long
coat
,
with
folded
arms
,
*NL*
and
bearing
in
his
right
fist
a
bludgeon
of
which
the
leaden
head
was
*NL*
visible
,
stood
a
few
paces
in
the
rear
of
the
spot
where
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
was
crouching
over
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
aid
of
the
darkness
,
it
seemed
a
sort
of
apparition
.
An
*NL*
ordinary
man
would
have
been
alarmed
because
of
the
twilight
,
a
*NL*
thoughtful
man
on
account
of
the
bludgeon
.
Jean
Valjean
recognized
*NL*
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
divined
,
no
doubt
,
that
Thenardier
's
pursuer
was
no
other
*NL*
than
Javert
.
Javert
,
after
his
unlooked-for
escape
from
the
barricade
,
*NL*
had
betaken
himself
to
the
prefecture
of
police
,
had
rendered
a
*NL*
verbal
account
to
the
Prefect
in
person
in
a
brief
audience
,
had
then
*NL*
immediately
gone
on
duty
again
,
which
implied
--
the
note
,
the
reader
will
*NL*
recollect
,
which
had
been
captured
on
his
person
--
a
certain
surveillance
*NL*
of
the
shore
on
the
right
bank
of
the
Seine
near
the
Champs-Elysees
,
*NL*
which
had
,
for
some
time
past
,
aroused
the
attention
of
the
police
.
*NL*
There
he
had
caught
sight
of
Thenardier
and
had
followed
him
.
The
reader
*NL*
knows
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
it
will
be
easily
understood
that
that
grating
,
so
obligingly
*NL*
opened
to
Jean
Valjean
,
was
a
bit
of
cleverness
on
Thenardier
's
part
.
*NL*
Thenardier
intuitively
felt
that
Javert
was
still
there
;
the
man
spied
*NL*
upon
has
a
scent
which
never
deceives
him
;
it
was
necessary
to
fling
*NL*
a
bone
to
that
sleuth-hound
.
An
assassin
,
what
a
godsend
!
Such
an
*NL*
opportunity
must
never
be
allowed
to
slip
.
Thenardier
,
by
putting
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
outside
in
his
stead
,
provided
a
prey
for
the
police
,
forced
*NL*
them
to
relinquish
his
scent
,
made
them
forget
him
in
a
bigger
*NL*
adventure
,
repaid
Javert
for
his
waiting
,
which
always
flatters
a
spy
,
*NL*
earned
thirty
francs
,
and
counted
with
certainty
,
so
far
as
he
himself
*NL*
was
concerned
,
on
escaping
with
the
aid
of
this
diversion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
fallen
from
one
danger
upon
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
encounters
,
this
falling
one
after
the
other
,
from
Thenardier
*NL*
upon
Javert
,
was
a
rude
shock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
did
not
recognize
Jean
Valjean
,
who
,
as
we
have
stated
,
no
longer
*NL*
looked
like
himself
.
He
did
not
unfold
his
arms
,
he
made
sure
of
his
*NL*
bludgeon
in
his
fist
,
by
an
imperceptible
movement
,
and
said
in
a
curt
,
*NL*
calm
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
`
I
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jean
Valjean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
thrust
his
bludgeon
between
his
teeth
,
bent
his
knees
,
inclined
*NL*
his
body
,
laid
his
two
powerful
hands
on
the
shoulders
of
Jean
Valjean
,
*NL*
which
were
clamped
within
them
as
in
a
couple
of
vices
,
scrutinized
*NL*
him
,
and
recognized
him
.
Their
faces
almost
touched
.
Javert
's
look
was
*NL*
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
remained
inert
beneath
Javert
's
grasp
,
like
a
lion
*NL*
submitting
to
the
claws
of
a
lynx
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inspector
Javert
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
have
me
in
your
power
.
Moreover
,
I
*NL*
have
regarded
myself
as
your
prisoner
ever
since
this
morning
.
I
did
not
*NL*
give
you
my
address
with
any
intention
of
escaping
from
you
.
Take
me
.
*NL*
Only
grant
me
one
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
did
not
appear
to
hear
him
.
He
kept
his
eyes
riveted
on
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
His
chin
being
contracted
,
thrust
his
lips
upwards
towards
*NL*
his
nose
,
a
sign
of
savage
revery
.
At
length
he
released
Jean
Valjean
,
*NL*
straightened
himself
stiffly
up
without
bending
,
grasped
his
bludgeon
*NL*
again
firmly
,
and
,
as
though
in
a
dream
,
he
murmured
rather
than
uttered
*NL*
this
question
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
here
?
And
who
is
this
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
abstained
from
addressing
Jean
Valjean
as
thou
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
replied
,
and
the
sound
of
his
voice
appeared
to
rouse
*NL*
Javert
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
with
regard
to
him
that
I
desire
to
speak
to
you
.
Dispose
of
me
*NL*
as
you
see
fit
;
but
first
help
me
to
carry
him
home
.
That
is
all
that
I
*NL*
ask
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
's
face
contracted
as
was
always
the
case
when
any
one
seemed
to
*NL*
think
him
capable
of
making
a
concession
.
Nevertheless
,
he
did
not
say
*NL*
``
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
bent
over
,
drew
from
his
pocket
a
handkerchief
which
*NL*
he
moistened
in
the
water
and
with
which
he
then
wiped
Marius
'
*NL*
blood-stained
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
man
was
at
the
barricade
,
''
said
he
in
a
low
voice
and
as
though
*NL*
speaking
to
himself
.
``
He
is
the
one
they
called
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
spy
of
the
first
quality
,
who
had
observed
everything
,
listened
to
*NL*
everything
,
and
taken
in
everything
,
even
when
he
thought
that
he
was
to
*NL*
die
;
who
had
played
the
spy
even
in
his
agony
,
and
who
,
with
his
elbows
*NL*
leaning
on
the
first
step
of
the
sepulchre
,
had
taken
notes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seized
Marius
'
hand
and
felt
his
pulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
wounded
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
a
dead
man
,
''
said
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
replied
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
have
brought
him
thither
from
the
barricade
?
''
remarked
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
preoccupation
must
indeed
have
been
very
profound
for
him
not
to
*NL*
insist
on
this
alarming
rescue
through
the
sewer
,
and
for
him
not
to
*NL*
even
notice
Jean
Valjean
's
silence
after
his
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
on
his
side
,
seemed
to
have
but
one
thought
.
He
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
lives
in
the
Marais
,
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
with
his
*NL*
grandfather
.
I
do
not
recollect
his
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
fumbled
in
Marius
'
coat
,
pulled
out
his
pocket-book
,
opened
*NL*
it
at
the
page
which
Marius
had
pencilled
,
and
held
it
out
to
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
still
sufficient
light
to
admit
of
reading
.
Besides
this
,
*NL*
Javert
possessed
in
his
eye
the
feline
phosphorescence
of
night
*NL*
birds
.
He
deciphered
the
few
lines
written
by
Marius
,
and
muttered
:
*NL*
``
Gillenormand
,
Rue
des
Filles-du
Calvaire
,
No.
6
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
exclaimed
:
``
Coachman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
will
remember
that
the
hackney-coach
was
waiting
in
case
of
*NL*
need
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
kept
Marius
'
pocket-book
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
later
,
the
carriage
,
which
had
descended
by
the
inclined
plane
*NL*
of
the
watering-place
,
was
on
the
shore
.
Marius
was
laid
upon
the
back
*NL*
seat
,
and
Javert
seated
himself
on
the
front
seat
beside
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
slammed
,
and
the
carriage
drove
rapidly
away
,
ascending
the
*NL*
quays
in
the
direction
of
the
Bastille
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
quitted
the
quays
and
entered
the
streets
.
The
coachman
,
a
black
*NL*
form
on
his
box
,
whipped
up
his
thin
horses
.
A
glacial
silence
reigned
*NL*
in
the
carriage
.
Marius
,
motionless
,
with
his
body
resting
in
the
*NL*
corner
,
and
his
head
drooping
on
his
breast
,
his
arms
hanging
,
his
legs
*NL*
stiff
,
seemed
to
be
awaiting
only
a
coffin
;
Jean
Valjean
seemed
made
of
*NL*
shadow
,
and
Javert
of
stone
,
and
in
that
vehicle
full
of
night
,
whose
*NL*
interior
,
every
time
that
it
passed
in
front
of
a
street
lantern
,
*NL*
appeared
to
be
turned
lividly
wan
,
as
by
an
intermittent
flash
of
*NL*
lightning
,
chance
had
united
and
seemed
to
be
bringing
face
to
face
*NL*
the
three
forms
of
tragic
immobility
,
the
corpse
,
the
spectre
,
and
the
*NL*
statue
.

CHAPTER
X
--
RETURN
OF
THE
SON
WHO
WAS
PRODIGAL
OF
HIS
LIFE
*NL*
*NL*
At
every
jolt
over
the
pavement
,
a
drop
of
blood
trickled
from
Marius
'
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
fully
closed
in
when
the
carriage
arrived
at
No.
6
,
Rue
des
*NL*
Filles-du-Calvaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
the
first
to
alight
;
he
made
sure
with
one
glance
of
the
*NL*
number
on
the
carriage
gate
,
and
,
raising
the
heavy
knocker
of
beaten
*NL*
iron
,
embellished
in
the
old
style
,
with
a
male
goat
and
a
satyr
*NL*
confronting
each
other
,
he
gave
a
violent
peal
.
The
gate
opened
a
little
*NL*
way
and
Javert
gave
it
a
push
.
The
porter
half
made
his
appearance
*NL*
yawning
,
vaguely
awake
,
and
with
a
candle
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everyone
in
the
house
was
asleep
.
People
go
to
bed
betimes
in
the
*NL*
Marais
,
especially
on
days
when
there
is
a
revolt
.
This
good
,
old
*NL*
quarter
,
terrified
at
the
Revolution
,
takes
refuge
in
slumber
,
as
*NL*
children
,
when
they
hear
the
Bugaboo
coming
,
hide
their
heads
hastily
*NL*
under
their
coverlet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
Jean
Valjean
and
the
coachman
had
taken
Marius
out
of
*NL*
the
carriage
,
Jean
Valjean
supporting
him
under
the
armpits
,
and
the
*NL*
coachman
under
the
knees
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
thus
bore
Marius
,
Jean
Valjean
slipped
his
hand
under
the
*NL*
latter
's
clothes
,
which
were
broadly
rent
,
felt
his
breast
,
and
assured
*NL*
himself
that
his
heart
was
still
beating
.
It
was
even
beating
a
little
*NL*
less
feebly
,
as
though
the
movement
of
the
carriage
had
brought
about
a
*NL*
certain
fresh
access
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
addressed
the
porter
in
a
tone
befitting
the
government
,
and
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
porter
of
a
factious
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
person
whose
name
is
Gillenormand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
.
What
do
you
want
with
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
son
is
brought
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
son
?
''
said
the
porter
stupidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
who
,
soiled
and
tattered
,
stood
behind
Javert
,
and
whom
*NL*
the
porter
was
surveying
with
some
horror
,
made
a
sign
to
him
with
his
*NL*
head
that
this
was
not
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
did
not
appear
to
understand
either
Javert
's
words
or
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
sign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
went
to
the
barricade
,
and
here
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
barricade
?
''
ejaculated
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
got
himself
killed
.
Go
waken
his
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
did
not
stir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
along
with
you
!
''
repeated
Javert
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
a
funeral
here
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
Javert
,
the
usual
incidents
of
the
public
highway
were
categorically
*NL*
classed
,
which
is
the
beginning
of
foresight
and
surveillance
,
and
each
*NL*
contingency
had
its
own
compartment
;
all
possible
facts
were
arranged
*NL*
in
drawers
,
as
it
were
,
whence
they
emerged
on
occasion
,
in
variable
*NL*
quantities
;
in
the
street
,
uproar
,
revolt
,
carnival
,
and
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
contented
himself
with
waking
Basque
.
Basque
woke
Nicolette
;
*NL*
Nicolette
roused
great-aunt
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
grandfather
,
they
let
him
sleep
on
,
thinking
that
he
would
*NL*
hear
about
the
matter
early
enough
in
any
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
carried
up
to
the
first
floor
,
without
any
one
in
the
other
*NL*
parts
of
the
house
being
aware
of
the
fact
,
and
deposited
on
an
old
sofa
*NL*
in
M.
Gillenormand
's
antechamber
;
and
while
Basque
went
in
search
of
a
*NL*
physician
,
and
while
Nicolette
opened
the
linen-presses
,
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
felt
Javert
touch
him
on
the
shoulder
.
He
understood
and
descended
the
*NL*
stairs
,
having
behind
him
the
step
of
Javert
who
was
following
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
watched
them
take
their
departure
as
he
had
watched
their
*NL*
arrival
,
in
terrified
somnolence
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
carriage
once
more
,
and
the
coachman
mounted
his
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Inspector
Javert
,
''
said
Jean
,
``
grant
me
yet
another
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
demanded
Javert
roughly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
go
home
for
one
instant
.
Then
you
shall
do
whatever
you
like
*NL*
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
,
with
his
chin
drawn
back
into
*NL*
the
collar
of
his
great-coat
,
then
he
lowered
the
glass
and

:

not
open
their
lips
again
during
the
whole
space
of
their
ride
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
Jean
Valjean
want
?
To
finish
what
he
had
begun
;
to
warn
*NL*
Cosette
,
to
tell
her
where
Marius
was
,
to
give
her
,
possibly
,
some
other
*NL*
useful
information
,
to
take
,
if
he
could
,
certain
final
measures
.
As
*NL*
for
himself
,
so
far
as
he
was
personally
concerned
,
all
was
over
;
he
had
*NL*
been
seized
by
Javert
and
had
not
resisted
;
any
other
man
than
himself
*NL*
in
like
situation
would
,
perhaps
,
have
had
some
vague
thoughts
connected
*NL*
with
the
rope
which
Thenardier
had
given
him
,
and
of
the
bars
of
the
*NL*
first
cell
that
he
should
enter
;
but
,
let
us
impress
it
upon
the
*NL*
reader
,
after
the
Bishop
,
there
had
existed
in
Jean
Valjean
a
profound
*NL*
hesitation
in
the
presence
of
any
violence
,
even
when
directed
against
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suicide
,
that
mysterious
act
of
violence
against
the
unknown
which
may
*NL*
contain
,
in
a
measure
,
the
death
of
the
soul
,
was
impossible
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
entrance
to
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
the
carriage
halted
,
the
way
*NL*
being
too
narrow
to
admit
of
the
entrance
of
vehicles
.
Javert
and
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
alighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
humbly
represented
to
``
monsieur
l'Inspecteur
,
''
that
the
*NL*
Utrecht
velvet
of
his
carriage
was
all
spotted
with
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
assassinated
man
,
and
with
mire
from
the
assassin
.
That
is
the
way
he
*NL*
understood
it
.
He
added
that
an
indemnity
was
due
him
.
At
the
same
time
,
*NL*
drawing
his
certificate
book
from
his
pocket
,
he
begged
the
inspector
to
*NL*
have
the
goodness
to
write
him
``
a
bit
of
an
attestation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
thrust
aside
the
book
which
the
coachman
held
out
to
him
,
and
*NL*
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
you
want
,
including
your
time
of
waiting
and
the
drive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
comes
to
seven
hours
and
a
quarter
,
''
replied
the
man
,
``
and
my
velvet
*NL*
was
perfectly
new
.
Eighty
francs
,
Mr.
Inspector
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
drew
four
napoleons
from
his
pocket
and
dismissed
the
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
fancied
that
it
was
Javert
's
intention
to
conduct
him
on
*NL*
foot
to
the
post
of
the
Blancs-Manteaux
or
to
the
post
of
the
Archives
,
*NL*
both
of
which
are
close
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
the
street
.
It
was
deserted
as
usual
.
Javert
followed
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
They
reached
No.
7
.
Jean
Valjean
knocked
.
The
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
well
,
''
said
Javert
.
``
Go
up
stairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
added
with
a
strange
expression
,
and
as
though
he
were
exerting
an
*NL*
effort
in
speaking
in
this
manner
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
wait
for
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
looked
at
Javert
.
This
mode
of
procedure
was
but
little
in
*NL*
accord
with
Javert
's
habits
.
However
,
he
could
not
be
greatly
surprised
*NL*
that
Javert
should
now
have
a
sort
of
haughty
confidence
in
him
,
the
*NL*
confidence
of
the
cat
which
grants
the
mouse
liberty
to
the
length
of
*NL*
its
claws
,
seeing
that
Jean
Valjean
had
made
up
his
mind
to
surrender
*NL*
himself
and
to
make
an
end
of
it
.
He
pushed
open
the
door
,
entered
the
*NL*
house
,
called
to
the
porter
who
was
in
bed
and
who
had
pulled
the
cord
*NL*
from
his
couch
:
``
It
is
I
!
''
and
ascended
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
at
the
first
floor
,
he
paused
.
All
sorrowful
roads
*NL*
have
their
stations
.
The
window
on
the
landing-place
,
which
was
a
*NL*
sash-window
,
was
open
.
As
in
many
ancient
houses
,
the
staircase
got
its
*NL*
light
from
without
and
had
a
view
on
the
street
.
The
street-lantern
,
*NL*
situated
directly
opposite
,
cast
some
light
on
the
stairs
,
and
thus
*NL*
effected
some
economy
in
illumination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
either
for
the
sake
of
getting
the
air
,
or
mechanically
,
*NL*
thrust
his
head
out
of
this
window
.
He
leaned
out
over
the
street
.
It
*NL*
is
short
,
and
the
lantern
lighted
it
from
end
to
end
.
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
with
amazement
;
there
was
no
longer
any
one
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
had
taken
his
departure
.

CHAPTER
XII
--
THE
GRANDFATHER
*NL*
*NL*
Basque
and
the
porter
had
carried
Marius
into
the
drawing-room
,
as
he
*NL*
still
lay
stretched
out
,
motionless
,
on
the
sofa
upon
which
he
had
been
*NL*
placed
on
his
arrival
.
The
doctor
who
had
been
sent
for
had
hastened
*NL*
thither
.
Aunt
Gillenormand
had
risen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Gillenormand
went
and
came
,
in
affright
,
wringing
her
hands
and
*NL*
incapable
of
doing
anything
but
saying
:
``
Heavens
!
is
it
possible
?
''
At
*NL*
times
she
added
:
``
Everything
will
be
covered
with
blood
.
''
When
her
first
*NL*
horror
had
passed
off
,
a
certain
philosophy
of
the
situation
penetrated
*NL*
her
mind
,
and
took
form
in
the
exclamation
:
``
It
was
bound
to
end
in
this
*NL*
way
!
''
She
did
not
go
so
far
as
:
``
I
told
you
so
!
''
which
is
customary
on
*NL*
this
sort
of
occasion
.
At
the
physician
's
orders
,
a
camp
bed
had
been
*NL*
prepared
beside
the
sofa
.
The
doctor
examined
Marius
,
and
after
having
*NL*
found
that
his
pulse
was
still
beating
,
that
the
wounded
man
had
no
very
*NL*
deep
wound
on
his
breast
,
and
that
the
blood
on
the
corners
of
his
lips
*NL*
proceeded
from
his
nostrils
,
he
had
him
placed
flat
on
the
bed
,
without
*NL*
a
pillow
,
with
his
head
on
the
same
level
as
his
body
,
and
even
a
*NL*
trifle
lower
,
and
with
his
bust
bare
in
order
to
facilitate
respiration
.
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
,
on
perceiving
that
they
were
undressing
*NL*
Marius
,
withdrew
.
She
set
herself
to
telling
her
beads
in
her
own
*NL*
chamber
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
trunk
had
not
suffered
any
internal
injury
;
a
bullet
,
deadened
by
*NL*
the
pocket-book
,
had
turned
aside
and
made
the
tour
of
his
ribs
with
a
*NL*
hideous
laceration
,
which
was
of
no
great
depth
,
and
consequently
,
not
*NL*
dangerous
.
The
long
,
underground
journey
had
completed
the
dislocation
*NL*
of
the
broken
collar-bone
,
and
the
disorder
there
was
serious
.
The
arms
*NL*
had
been
slashed
with
sabre
cuts
.
Not
a
single
scar
disfigured
his
face
;
*NL*
but
his
head
was
fairly
covered
with
cuts
;
what
would
be
the
result
of
*NL*
these
wounds
on
the
head
?
Would
they
stop
short
at
the
hairy
cuticle
,
or
*NL*
would
they
attack
the
brain
?
As
yet
,
this
could
not
be
decided
.
A
grave
*NL*
symptom
was
that
they
had
caused
a
swoon
,
and
that
people
do
not
always
*NL*
recover
from
such
swoons
.
Moreover
,
the
wounded
man
had
been
exhausted
*NL*
by
hemorrhage
.
From
the
waist
down
,
the
barricade
had
protected
the
*NL*
lower
part
of
the
body
from
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Basque
and
Nicolette
tore
up
linen
and
prepared
bandages
;
Nicolette
*NL*
sewed
them
,
Basque
rolled
them
.
As
lint
was
lacking
,
the
doctor
,
for
*NL*
the
time
being
,
arrested
the
bleeding
with
layers
of
wadding
.
Beside
*NL*
the
bed
,
three
candles
burned
on
a
table
where
the
case
of
surgical
*NL*
instruments
lay
spread
out
.
The
doctor
bathed
Marius
'
face
and
hair
with
*NL*
cold
water
.
A
full
pail
was
reddened
in
an
instant
.
The
porter
,
candle
*NL*
in
hand
,
lighted
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
seemed
to
be
pondering
sadly
.
From
time
to
time
,
he
made
a
*NL*
negative
sign
with
his
head
,
as
though
replying
to
some
question
which
*NL*
he
had
inwardly
addressed
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bad
sign
for
the
sick
man
are
these
mysterious
dialogues
of
the
doctor
*NL*
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
moment
when
the
doctor
was
wiping
Marius
'
face
,
and
lightly
*NL*
touching
his
still
closed
eyes
with
his
finger
,
a
door
opened
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
drawing-room
,
and
a
long
,
pallid
figure
made
its
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
revolt
had
,
for
the
past
two
days
,
deeply
agitated
,
enraged
and
*NL*
engrossed
the
mind
of
M.
Gillenormand
.
He
had
not
been
able
to
sleep
*NL*
on
the
previous
night
,
and
he
had
been
in
a
fever
all
day
long
.
In
the
*NL*
evening
,
he
had
gone
to
bed
very
early
,
recommending
that
everything
in
*NL*
the
house
should
be
well
barred
,
and
he
had
fallen
into
a
doze
through
*NL*
sheer
fatigue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Old
men
sleep
lightly
;
M.
Gillenormand
's
chamber
adjoined
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
and
in
spite
of
all
the
precautions
that
had
been
taken
,
*NL*
the
noise
had
awakened
him
.
Surprised
at
the
rift
of
light
which
he
*NL*
saw
under
his
door
,
he
had
risen
from
his
bed
,
and
had
groped
his
way
*NL*
thither
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
astonished
on
the
threshold
,
one
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
*NL*
half-open
door
,
with
his
head
bent
a
little
forward
and
quivering
,
*NL*
his
body
wrapped
in
a
white
dressing-gown
,
which
was
straight
and
as
*NL*
destitute
of
folds
as
a
winding-sheet
;
and
he
had
the
air
of
a
phantom
*NL*
who
is
gazing
into
a
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
the
bed
,
and
on
the
mattress
that
young
man
,
bleeding
,
white
with
*NL*
a
waxen
whiteness
,
with
closed
eyes
and
gaping
mouth
,
and
pallid
lips
,
*NL*
stripped
to
the
waist
,
slashed
all
over
with
crimson
wounds
,
motionless
*NL*
and
brilliantly
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandfather
trembled
from
head
to
foot
as
powerfully
as
ossified
*NL*
limbs
can
tremble
,
his
eyes
,
whose
corneae
were
yellow
on
account
of
*NL*
his
great
age
,
were
veiled
in
a
sort
of
vitreous
glitter
,
his
whole
*NL*
face
assumed
in
an
instant
the
earthy
angles
of
a
skull
,
his
arms
fell
*NL*
pendent
,
as
though
a
spring
had
broken
,
and
his
amazement
was
betrayed
*NL*
by
the
outspreading
of
the
fingers
of
his
two
aged
hands
,
which
quivered
*NL*
all
over
,
his
knees
formed
an
angle
in
front
,
allowing
,
through
*NL*
the
opening
in
his
dressing-gown
,
a
view
of
his
poor
bare
legs
,
all
*NL*
bristling
with
white
hairs
,
and
he
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marius
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Basque
,
``
Monsieur
has
just
been
brought
back
.
He
went
to
the
*NL*
barricade
,
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
!
''
cried
the
old
man
in
a
terrible
voice
.
``
Ah
!
The
rascal
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
sort
of
sepulchral
transformation
straightened
up
this
*NL*
centenarian
as
erect
as
a
young
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
he
,
``
you
are
the
doctor
.
Begin
by
telling
me
one
thing
.
He
*NL*
is
dead
,
is
he
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
who
was
at
the
highest
pitch
of
anxiety
,
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
wrung
his
hands
with
an
outburst
of
terrible
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
dead
!
He
is
dead
!
He
is
dead
!
He
has
got
himself
killed
on
*NL*
the
barricades
!
Out
of
hatred
to
me
!
He
did
that
to
spite
me
!
Ah
!
You
*NL*
blood-drinker
!
This
is
the
way
he
returns
to
me
!
Misery
of
my
life
,
he
*NL*
is
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
to
the
window
,
threw
it
wide
open
as
though
he
were
stifling
,
*NL*
and
,
erect
before
the
darkness
,
he
began
to
talk
into
the
street
,
to
the
*NL*
night
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pierced
,
sabred
,
exterminated
,
slashed
,
hacked
in
pieces
!
Just
look
at
*NL*
that
,
the
villain
!
He
knew
well
that
I
was
waiting
for
him
,
and
that
I
*NL*
had
had
his
room
arranged
,
and
that
I
had
placed
at
the
head
of
my
bed
*NL*
his
portrait
taken
when
he
was
a
little
child
!
He
knew
well
that
he
had
*NL*
only
to
come
back
,
and
that
I
had
been
recalling
him
for
years
,
and
that
*NL*
I
remained
by
my
fireside
,
with
my
hands
on
my
knees
,
not
knowing
what
*NL*
to
do
,
and
that
I
was
mad
over
it
!
You
knew
well
,
that
you
had
but
to
*NL*
return
and
to
say
:
`
It
is
I
,
'
and
you
would
have
been
the
master
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
that
I
should
have
obeyed
you
,
and
that
you
could
have
done
*NL*
whatever
you
pleased
with
your
old
numskull
of
a
grandfather
!
you
knew
*NL*
that
well
,
and
you
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
is
a
Royalist
,
I
will
not
go
!
And
you
went
to
the
barricades
,
*NL*
and
you
got
yourself
killed
out
of
malice
!
To
revenge
yourself
for
what
*NL*
I
said
to
you
about
Monsieur
le
Duc
de
Berry
.
It
is
infamous
!
Go
to
bed
*NL*
then
and
sleep
tranquilly
!
he
is
dead
,
and
this
is
my
awakening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
,
who
was
beginning
to
be
uneasy
in
both
quarters
,
quitted
*NL*
Marius
for
a
moment
,
went
to
M.
Gillenormand
,
and
took
his
arm
.
*NL*
The
grandfather
turned
round
,
gazed
at
him
with
eyes
which
seemed
*NL*
exaggerated
in
size
and
bloodshot
,
and
said
to
him
calmly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
sir
.
I
am
composed
,
I
am
a
man
,
I
witnessed
the
death
of
*NL*
Louis
XVI.
,
I
know
how
to
bear
events
.
One
thing
is
terrible
and
that
is
*NL*
to
think
that
it
is
your
newspapers
which
do
all
the
mischief
.
You
will
*NL*
have
scribblers
,
chatterers
,
lawyers
,
orators
,
tribunes
,
discussions
,
*NL*
progress
,
enlightenment
,
the
rights
of
man
,
the
liberty
of
the
press
,
*NL*
and
this
is
the
way
that
your
children
will
be
brought
home
to
you
.
Ah
!
*NL*
Marius
!
It
is
abominable
!
Killed
!
Dead
before
me
!
A
barricade
!
Ah
,
the
*NL*
scamp
!
Doctor
,
you
live
in
this
quarter
,
I
believe
?
Oh
!
I
know
you
well
.
*NL*
I
see
your
cabriolet
pass
my
window
.
I
am
going
to
tell
you
.
You
are
*NL*
wrong
to
think
that
I
am
angry
.
One
does
not
fly
into
a
rage
against
a
*NL*
dead
man
.
That
would
be
stupid
.
This
is
a
child
whom
I
have
reared
.
*NL*
I
was
already
old
while
he
was
very
young
.
He
played
in
the
Tuileries
*NL*
garden
with
his
little
shovel
and
his
little
chair
,
and
in
order
that
*NL*
the
inspectors
might
not
grumble
,
I
stopped
up
the
holes
that
he
made
in
*NL*
the
earth
with
his
shovel
,
with
my
cane
.
One
day
he
exclaimed
:
Down
with
*NL*
Louis
XVIII
.
!
and
off
he
went
.
It
was
no
fault
of
mine
.
He
was
all
rosy
*NL*
and
blond
.
His
mother
is
dead
.
Have
you
ever
noticed
that
all
little
*NL*
children
are
blond
?
Why
is
it
so
?
He
is
the
son
of
one
of
those
brigands
*NL*
of
the
Loire
,
but
children
are
innocent
of
their
fathers
'
crimes
.
*NL*
I
remember
when
he
was
no
higher
than
that
.
He
could
not
manage
*NL*
to
pronounce
his
Ds
.
He
had
a
way
of
talking
that
was
so
sweet
and
*NL*
indistinct
that
you
would
have
thought
it
was
a
bird
chirping
.
I
*NL*
remember
that
once
,
in
front
of
the
Hercules
Farnese
,
people
formed
a
*NL*
circle
to
admire
him
and
marvel
at
him
,
he
was
so
handsome
,
was
that
*NL*
child
!
He
had
a
head
such
as
you
see
in
pictures
.
I
talked
in
a
deep
*NL*
voice
,
and
I
frightened
him
with
my
cane
,
but
he
knew
very
well
that
it
*NL*
was
only
to
make
him
laugh
.
In
the
morning
,
when
he
entered
my
room
,
I
*NL*
grumbled
,
but
he
was
like
the
sunlight
to
me
,
all
the
same
.
One
can
not
*NL*
defend
oneself
against
those
brats
.
They
take
hold
of
you
,
they
hold
you
*NL*
fast
,
they
never
let
you
go
again
.
The
truth
is
,
that
there
never
was
a
*NL*
cupid
like
that
child
.
Now
,
what
can
you
say
for
your
Lafayettes
,
your
*NL*
Benjamin
Constants
,
and
your
Tirecuir
de
Corcelles
who
have
killed
him
?
*NL*
This
can
not
be
allowed
to
pass
in
this
fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
Marius
,
who
still
lay
livid
and
motionless
,
and
to
whom
*NL*
the
physician
had
returned
,
and
began
once
more
to
wring
his
hands
.
The
*NL*
old
man
's
pallid
lips
moved
as
though
mechanically
,
and
permitted
the
*NL*
passage
of
words
that
were
barely
audible
,
like
breaths
in
the
death
*NL*
agony
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
heartless
lad
!
Ah
!
clubbist
!
Ah
!
wretch
!
Ah
!
Septembrist
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Reproaches
in
the
low
voice
of
an
agonizing
man
,
addressed
to
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
as
it
is
always
indispensable
that
internal
eruptions
*NL*
should
come
to
the
light
,
the
sequence
of
words
returned
,
but
the
*NL*
grandfather
appeared
no
longer
to
have
the
strength
to
utter
them
,
his
*NL*
voice
was
so
weak
,
and
extinct
,
that
it
seemed
to
come
from
the
other
*NL*
side
of
an
abyss
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
the
same
to
me
,
I
am
going
to
die
too
,
that
I
am
.
And
*NL*
to
think
that
there
is
not
a
hussy
in
Paris
who
would
not
have
been
*NL*
delighted
to
make
this
wretch
happy
!
A
scamp
who
,
instead
of
amusing
*NL*
himself
and
enjoying
life
,
went
off
to
fight
and
get
himself
shot
down
*NL*
like
a
brute
!
And
for
whom
?
Why
?
For
the
Republic
!
Instead
of
going
to
*NL*
dance
at
the
Chaumiere
,
as
it
is
the
duty
of
young
folks
to
do
!
What
's
*NL*
the
use
of
being
twenty
years
old
?
The
Republic
,
a
cursed
pretty
folly
!
*NL*
Poor
mothers
,
beget
fine
boys
,
do
!
Come
,
he
is
dead
.
That
will
make
two
*NL*
funerals
under
the
same
carriage
gate
.
So
you
have
got
yourself
arranged
*NL*
like
this
for
the
sake
of
General
Lamarque
's
handsome
eyes
!
What
had
*NL*
that
General
Lamarque
done
to
you
?
A
slasher
!
A
chatter-box
!
To
get
*NL*
oneself
killed
for
a
dead
man
!
If
that
is
n't
enough
to
drive
any
one
*NL*
mad
!
Just
think
of
it
!
At
twenty
!
And
without
so
much
as
turning
his
*NL*
head
to
see
whether
he
was
not
leaving
something
behind
him
!
That
's
the
*NL*
way
poor
,
good
old
fellows
are
forced
to
die
alone
,
now-adays
.
Perish
*NL*
in
your
corner
,
owl
!
Well
,
after
all
,
so
much
the
better
,
that
is
what
*NL*
I
was
hoping
for
,
this
will
kill
me
on
the
spot
.
I
am
too
old
,
I
am
*NL*
a
hundred
years
old
,
I
am
a
hundred
thousand
years
old
,
I
ought
,
by
*NL*
rights
,
to
have
been
dead
long
ago
.
This
blow
puts
an
end
to
it
.
So
all
*NL*
is
over
,
what
happiness
!
What
is
the
good
of
making
him
inhale
ammonia
*NL*
and
all
that
parcel
of
drugs
?
You
are
wasting
your
trouble
,
you
fool
of
*NL*
a
doctor
!
Come
,
he
's
dead
,
completely
dead
.
I
know
all
about
it
,
I
*NL*
am
dead
myself
too
.
He
has
n't
done
things
by
half
.
Yes
,
this
age
is
*NL*
infamous
,
infamous
and
that
's
what
I
think
of
you
,
of
your
ideas
,
of
*NL*
your
systems
,
of
your
masters
,
of
your
oracles
,
of
your
doctors

of
your

scape-graces
of

of
your
rascally
philosophers
,
and
of
all
the
*NL*
revolutions
which
,
for
the
last
sixty
years
,
have
been
frightening
*NL*
the
flocks
of
crows
in
the
Tuileries
!
But
you
were
pitiless
in
getting
*NL*
yourself
killed
like
this
,
I
shall
not
even
grieve
over
your
death
,
do
*NL*
you
understand

you
assassin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
Marius
slowly
opened
his
eyes
,
and
his
glance
,
still
*NL*
dimmed
by
lethargic
wonder

rested
on

cried

JAVERT
DERAILED

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
I
--
JAVERT
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
passed
slowly
down
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
with
drooping
head
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
and
*NL*
likewise
,
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
with
his
hands
behind
his
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
that
day
,
Javert
had
borrowed
from
Napoleon
's
attitudes
,
only
that
*NL*
which
is
expressive
of
resolution
,
with
arms
folded
across
the
chest
;
*NL*
that
which
is
expressive
of
uncertainty
--
with
the
hands
behind
the
*NL*
back
--
had
been
unknown
to
him
.
Now
,
a
change
had
taken
place
;
his
whole
*NL*
person
,
slow
and
sombre
,
was
stamped
with
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
plunged
into
the
silent
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
followed
one
given
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
the
shortest
cut
to
the
Seine
,
reached
the
Quai
des
Ormes
,
*NL*
skirted
the
quay
,
passed
the
Greve
,
and
halted
at
some
distance
from
*NL*
the
post
of
the
Place
du
Chatelet
,
at
the
angle
of
the
Pont
Notre-Dame
.
*NL*
There
,
between
the
Notre-Dame
and
the
Pont
au
Change
on
the
one
hand
,
*NL*
and
the
Quai
de
la
Megisserie
and
the
Quai
aux
Fleurs
on
the
other
,
the
*NL*
Seine
forms
a
sort
of
square
lake
,
traversed
by
a
rapid
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
point
of
the
Seine
is
dreaded
by
mariners
.
Nothing
is
more
*NL*
dangerous
than
this
rapid
,
hemmed
in
,
at
that
epoch
,
and
irritated
by
*NL*
the
piles
of
the
mill
on
the
bridge
,
now
demolished
.
The
two
bridges
,
*NL*
situated
thus
close
together
,
augment
the
peril
;
the
water
hurries
in
*NL*
formidable
wise
through
the
arches
.
It
rolls
in
vast
and
terrible
waves
;
*NL*
it
accumulates
and
piles
up
there
;
the
flood
attacks
the
piles
of
the
*NL*
bridges
as
though
in
an
effort
to
pluck
them
up
with
great
liquid
ropes
.
*NL*
Men
who
fall
in
there
never
re-appear
;
the
best
of
swimmers
are
drowned
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
leaned
both
elbows
on
the
parapet
,
his
chin
resting
in
both
*NL*
hands
,
and
,
while
his
nails
were
mechanically
twined
in
the
abundance
of
*NL*
his
whiskers
,
he
meditated
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
novelty
,
a
revolution
,
a
catastrophe
had
just
taken
place
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
his
being
;
and
he
had
something
upon
which
to
examine
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
was
undergoing
horrible
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
hours
,
Javert
had
ceased
to
be
simple
.
He
was
troubled
;
*NL*
that
brain
,
so
limpid
in
its
blindness
,
had
lost
its
transparency
;
that
*NL*
crystal
was
clouded
.
Javert
felt
duty
divided
within
his
conscience
,
and
*NL*
he
could
not
conceal
the
fact
from
himself
.
When
he
had
so
unexpectedly
*NL*
encountered
Jean
Valjean
on
the
banks
of
the
Seine
,
there
had
been
in
*NL*
him
something
of
the
wolf
which
regains
his
grip
on
his
prey
,
and
of
the
*NL*
dog
who
finds
his
master
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beheld
before
him
two
paths
,
both
equally
straight
,
but
he
beheld
*NL*
two
;
and
that
terrified
him
;
him
,
who
had
never
in
all
his
life
known
*NL*
more
than
one
straight
line
.
And
,
the
poignant
anguish
lay
in
this
,
that
*NL*
the
two
paths
were
contrary
to
each
other
.
One
of
these
straight
lines
*NL*
excluded
the
other
.
Which
of
the
two
was
the
true
one
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
situation
was
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
owe
his
life
to
a
malefactor
,
to
accept
that
debt
and
to
repay
it
;
to
*NL*
be
,
in
spite
of
himself
,
on
a
level
with
a
fugitive
from
justice
,
and
to
*NL*
repay
his
service
with
another
service
;
to
allow
it
to
be
said
to
him
,
*NL*
``
Go
,
''
and
to
say
to
the
latter
in
his
turn
:
``
Be
free
''
;
to
sacrifice
to
*NL*
personal
motives
duty
,
that
general
obligation
,
and
to
be
conscious
,
*NL*
in
those
personal
motives
,
of
something
that
was
also
general
,
and
,
*NL*
perchance
,
superior
,
to
betray
society
in
order
to
remain
true
to
his
*NL*
conscience
;
that
all
these
absurdities
should
be
realized
and
should
*NL*
accumulate
upon
him
,
--
this
was
what
overwhelmed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
thing
had
amazed
him
,
--
this
was
that
Jean
Valjean
should
have
done
*NL*
him
a
favor
,
and
one
thing
petrified
him
,
--
that
he
,
Javert
,
should
have
*NL*
done
Jean
Valjean
a
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
did
he
stand
?
He
sought
to
comprehend
his
position
,
and
could
no
*NL*
longer
find
his
bearings
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
now
?
To
deliver
up
Jean
Valjean
was
bad
;
to
leave
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
at
liberty
was
bad
.
In
the
first
case
,
the
man
of
authority
fell
*NL*
lower
than
the
man
of
the
galleys
,
in
the
second
,
a
convict
rose
above
*NL*
the
law
,
and
set
his
foot
upon
it
.
In
both
cases
,
dishonor
for
him
,
*NL*
Javert
.
There
was
disgrace
in
any
resolution
at
which
he
might
arrive
.
*NL*
Destiny
has
some
extremities
which
rise
perpendicularly
from
the
*NL*
impossible
,
and
beyond
which
life
is
no
longer
anything
but
a
precipice
.
*NL*
Javert
had
reached
one
of
those
extremities
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
his
anxieties
consisted
in
being
constrained
to
think
.
The
very
*NL*
violence
of
all
these
conflicting
emotions
forced
him
to
it
.
Thought
was
*NL*
something
to
which
he
was
unused
,
and
which
was
peculiarly
painful
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
thought
there
always
exists
a
certain
amount
of
internal
rebellion
;
*NL*
and
it
irritated
him
to
have
that
within
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thought
on
any
subject
whatever
,
outside
of
the
restricted
circle
of
his
*NL*
functions
,
would
have
been
for
him
in
any
case
useless
and
a
fatigue
;
*NL*
thought
on
the
day
which
had
just
passed
was
a
torture
.
Nevertheless
,
it
*NL*
was
indispensable
that
he
should
take
a
look
into
his
conscience
,
after
*NL*
such
shocks
,
and
render
to
himself
an
account
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
he
had
just
done
made
him
shudder
.
He
,
Javert
,
had
seen
fit
to
*NL*
decide
,
contrary
to
all
the
regulations
of
the
police
,
contrary
to
the
*NL*
whole
social
and
judicial
organization
,
contrary
to
the
entire
code
,
*NL*
upon
a
release
;
this
had
suited
him
;
he
had
substituted
his
own
affairs
*NL*
for
the
affairs
of
the
public
;
was
not
this
unjustifiable
?
Every
time
*NL*
that
he
brought
himself
face
to
face
with
this
deed
without
a
name
which
*NL*
he
had
committed
,
he
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
Upon
what
should
he
*NL*
decide
?
One
sole
resource
remained
to
him
;
to
return
in
all
haste
to
*NL*
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
and
commit
Jean
Valjean
to
prison
.
It
was
clear
*NL*
that
that
was
what
he
ought
to
do
.
He
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
barred
his
way
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
?
What
?
Is
there
in
the
world
,
anything
outside
of
the
*NL*
tribunals
,
executory
sentences
,
the
police
and
the
authorities
?
Javert
*NL*
was
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
galley-slave
sacred
!
A
convict
who
could
not
be
touched
by
the
law
!
*NL*
And
that
the
deed
of
Javert
!
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
not
a
fearful
thing
that
Javert
and
Jean
Valjean
,
the
man
made
to
*NL*
proceed
with
vigor
,
the
man
made
to
submit
,
--
that
these
two
men
who
were
*NL*
both
the
things
of
the
law
,
should
have
come
to
such
a
pass
,
that
both
*NL*
of
them
had
set
themselves
above
the
law
?
What
then
!
such
enormities
*NL*
were
to
happen
and
no
one
was
to
be
punished
!
Jean
Valjean
,
stronger
*NL*
than
the
whole
social
order
,
was
to
remain
at
liberty
,
and
he
,
Javert
,
*NL*
was
to
go
on
eating
the
government
's
bread
!
*NL*
*NL*
His
revery
gradually
became
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
might
,
athwart
this
revery
,
have
also
reproached
himself
on
*NL*
the
subject
of
that
insurgent
who
had
been
taken
to
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Filles-du-Calvaire
;
but
he
never
even
thought
of
that
.
The
lesser
fault
*NL*
was
lost
in
the
greater
.
Besides
,
that
insurgent
was
,
obviously
,
a
dead
*NL*
man
,
and
,
legally
,
death
puts
an
end
to
pursuit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
the
load
which
weighed
upon
his
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
disconcerted
him
.
All
the
axioms
which
had
served
him
as
*NL*
points
of
support
all
his
life
long
,
had
crumbled
away
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
this
man
.
Jean
Valjean
's
generosity
towards
him
,
Javert
,
crushed
him
.
*NL*
Other
facts
which
he
now
recalled
,
and
which
he
had
formerly
treated
*NL*
as
lies
and
folly
,
now
recurred
to
him
as
realities
.
M.
Madeleine
*NL*
re-appeared
behind
Jean
Valjean
,
and
the
two
figures
were
superposed
in
*NL*
such
fashion
that
they
now
formed
but
one
,
which
was
venerable
.
Javert
*NL*
felt
that
something
terrible
was
penetrating
his
soul
--
admiration
for
*NL*
a
convict
.
Respect
for
a
galley-slave
--
is
that
a
possible
thing
?
He
*NL*
shuddered
at
it
,
yet
could
not
escape
from
it
.
In
vain
did
he
struggle
,
*NL*
he
was
reduced
to
confess
,
in
his
inmost
heart
,
the
sublimity
of
that
*NL*
wretch
.
This
was
odious
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
benevolent
malefactor
,
merciful
,
gentle
,
helpful
,
clement
,
a
convict
,
*NL*
returning
good
for
evil
,
giving
back
pardon
for
hatred
,
preferring
pity
*NL*
to
vengeance
,
preferring
to
ruin
himself
rather
than
to
ruin
his
enemy
,
*NL*
saving
him
who
had
smitten
him
,
kneeling
on
the
heights
of
virtue
,
more
*NL*
nearly
akin
to
an
angel
than
to
a
man
.
Javert
was
constrained
to
admit
*NL*
to
himself
that
this
monster
existed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
could
not
go
on
in
this
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
,
and
we
insist
upon
this
point
,
he
had
not
yielded
without
*NL*
resistance
to
that
monster
,
to
that
infamous
angel
,
to
that
hideous
*NL*
hero
,
who
enraged
almost
as
much
as
he
amazed
him
.
Twenty
times
,
as
he
*NL*
sat
in
that
carriage
face
to
face
with
Jean
Valjean
,
the
legal
tiger
had
*NL*
roared
within
him
.
A
score
of
times
he
had
been
tempted
to
fling
himself
*NL*
upon
Jean
Valjean
,
to
seize
him
and
devour
him
,
that
is
to
say
,
to
*NL*
arrest
him
.
What
more
simple
,
in
fact
?
To
cry
out
at
the
first
post
that
*NL*
they
passed
:
--
``
Here
is
a
fugitive
from
justice
,
who
has
broken
his
ban
!
''
*NL*
to
summon
the
gendarmes
and
say
to
them
:
``
This
man
is
yours
!
''
then
to
*NL*
go
off
,
leaving
that
condemned
man
there
,
to
ignore
the
rest
and
not
to
*NL*
meddle
further
in
the
matter
.
This
man
is
forever
a
prisoner
of
the
law
;
*NL*
the
law
may
do
with
him
what
it
will
.
What
could
be
more
just
?
Javert
*NL*
had
said
all
this
to
himself
;
he
had
wished
to
pass
beyond
,
to
act
,
to
*NL*
apprehend
the
man
,
and
then
,
as
at
present
,
he
had
not
been
able
to
do
*NL*
it
;
and
every
time
that
his
arm
had
been
raised
convulsively
towards
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
collar
,
his
hand
had
fallen
back
again
,
as
beneath
an
*NL*
enormous
weight
,
and
in
the
depths
of
his
thought
he
had
heard
a
voice
,
*NL*
a
strange
voice
crying
to
him
:
--
``
It
is
well
.
Deliver
up
your
savior
.
*NL*
Then
have
the
basin
of
Pontius
Pilate
brought
and
wash
your
claws
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
reflections
reverted
to
himself
and
beside
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
glorified
he
beheld
himself
,
Javert
,
degraded
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
convict
was
his
benefactor
!
*NL*
*NL*
But
then
,
why
had
he
permitted
that
man
to
leave
him
alive
?
He
had
*NL*
the
right
to
be
killed
in
that
barricade
.
He
should
have
asserted
that
*NL*
right
.
It
would
have
been
better
to
summon
the
other
insurgents
to
his
*NL*
succor
against
Jean
Valjean
,
to
get
himself
shot
by
force
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
supreme
anguish
was
the
loss
of
certainty
.
He
felt
that
he
had
been
*NL*
uprooted
.
The
code
was
no
longer
anything
more
than
a
stump
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
He
had
to
deal
with
scruples
of
an
unknown
species
.
There
had
taken
*NL*
place
within
him
a
sentimental
revelation
entirely
distinct
from
legal
*NL*
affirmation
,
his
only
standard
of
measurement
hitherto
.
To
remain
in
his
*NL*
former
uprightness
did
not
suffice
.
A
whole
order
of
unexpected
facts
*NL*
had
cropped
up
and
subjugated
him
.
A
whole
new
world
was
dawning
on
*NL*
his
soul
:
kindness
accepted
and
repaid
,
devotion
,
mercy
,
indulgence
,
*NL*
violences
committed
by
pity
on
austerity
,
respect
for
persons
,
no
more
*NL*
definitive
condemnation
,
no
more
conviction
,
the
possibility
of
a
tear
*NL*
in
the
eye
of
the
law
,
no
one
knows
what
justice
according
to
God
,
*NL*
running
in
inverse
sense
to
justice
according
to
men
.
He
perceived
amid
*NL*
the
shadows
the
terrible
rising
of
an
unknown
moral
sun
;
it
horrified
*NL*
and
dazzled
him
.
An
owl
forced
to
the
gaze
of
an
eagle
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
to
himself
that
it
was
true
that
there
were
exceptional
cases
,
*NL*
that
authority
might
be
put
out
of
countenance
,
that
the
rule
might
*NL*
be
inadequate
in
the
presence
of
a
fact
,
that
everything
could
not
*NL*
be
framed
within
the
text
of
the
code
,
that
the
unforeseen
compelled
*NL*
obedience
,
that
the
virtue
of
a
convict
might
set
a
snare
for
the
virtue
*NL*
of
the
functionary
,
that
destiny
did
indulge
in
such
ambushes
,
and
*NL*
he
reflected
with
despair
that
he
himself
had
not
even
been
fortified
*NL*
against
a
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
forced
to
acknowledge
that
goodness
did
exist
.
This
convict
had
*NL*
been
good
.
And
he
himself
,
unprecedented
circumstance
,
had
just
been
*NL*
good
also
.
So
he
was
becoming
depraved
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
that
he
was
a
coward
.
He
conceived
a
horror
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
's
ideal
,
was
not
to
be
human
,
to
be
grand
,
to
be
sublime
;
it
was
*NL*
to
be
irreproachable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
he
had
just
failed
in
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
had
he
come
to
such
a
pass
?
How
had
all
this
happened
?
He
could
not
*NL*
have
told
himself
.
He
clasped
his
head
in
both
hands
,
but
in
spite
of
*NL*
all
that
he
could
do
,
he
could
not
contrive
to
explain
it
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
certainly
always
entertained
the
intention
of
restoring
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
to
the
law
of
which
Jean
Valjean
was
the
captive
,
and
of
which
*NL*
he
,
Javert
,
was
the
slave
.
Not
for
a
single
instant
while
he
held
him
*NL*
in
his
grasp
had
he
confessed
to
himself
that
he
entertained
the
idea
of
*NL*
releasing
him
.
It
was
,
in
some
sort
,
without
his
consciousness
,
that
his
*NL*
hand
had
relaxed
and
had
let
him
go
free
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
sorts
of
interrogation
points
flashed
before
his
eyes
.
He
put
*NL*
questions
to
himself
,
and
made
replies
to
himself
,
and
his
replies
*NL*
frightened
him
.
He
asked
himself
:
``
What
has
that
convict
done
,
that
*NL*
desperate
fellow
,
whom
I
have
pursued
even
to
persecution
,
and
who
has
*NL*
had
me
under
his
foot
,
and
who
could
have
avenged
himself
,
and
who
*NL*
owed
it
both
to
his
rancor
and
to
his
safety
,
in
leaving
me
my
life
,
in
*NL*
showing
mercy
upon
me
?
His
duty
?
No
.
Something
more
.
And
I
in
showing
*NL*
mercy
upon
him
in
my
turn
--
what
have
I
done
?
My
duty
?
No
.
Something
*NL*
more
.
So
there
is
something
beyond
duty
?
''
Here
he
took
fright
;
his
*NL*
balance
became
disjointed
;
one
of
the
scales
fell
into
the
abyss
,
the
*NL*
other
rose
heavenward
,
and
Javert
was
no
less
terrified
by
the
one
which
*NL*
was
on
high
than
by
the
one
which
was
below
.
Without
being
in
the
least
*NL*
in
the
world
what
is
called
Voltairian
or
a
philosopher
,
or
incredulous
,
*NL*
being
,
on
the
contrary
,
respectful
by
instinct
,
towards
the
established
*NL*
church
,
he
knew
it
only
as
an
august
fragment
of
the
social
whole
;
order
*NL*
was
his
dogma
,
and
sufficed
for
him
;
ever
since
he
had
attained
to
man
's
*NL*
estate
and
the
rank
of
a
functionary
,
he
had
centred
nearly
all
his
*NL*
religion
in
the
police
.
Being
,
--
and
here
we
employ
words
without
the
*NL*
least
irony
and
in
their
most
serious
acceptation
,
being
,
as
we
have
*NL*
said
,
a
spy
as
other
men
are
priests
.
He
had
a
superior
,
M.
Gisquet
;
up
*NL*
to
that
day
he
had
never
dreamed
of
that
other
superior
,
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
new
chief
,
God
,
he
became
unexpectedly
conscious
of
,
and
he
felt
*NL*
embarrassed
by
him
.
This
unforeseen
presence
threw
him
off
his
bearings
;
*NL*
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
this
superior
,
he
,
who
was
not
ignorant
*NL*
of
the
fact
that
the
subordinate
is
bound
always
to
bow
,
that
he
must
*NL*
not
disobey
,
nor
find
fault
,
nor
discuss
,
and
that
,
in
the
presence
of
a
*NL*
superior
who
amazes
him
too
greatly
,
the
inferior
has
no
other
resource
*NL*
than
that
of
handing
in
his
resignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
was
he
to
set
about
handing
in
his
resignation
to
God
?
*NL*
*NL*
However
things
might
stand
,
--
and
it
was
to
this
point
that
he
reverted
*NL*
constantly
,
--
one
fact
dominated
everything
else
for
him
,
and
that
was
,
*NL*
that
he
had
just
committed
a
terrible
infraction
of
the
law
.
He
had
just
*NL*
shut
his
eyes
on
an
escaped
convict
who
had
broken
his
ban
.
He
had
just
*NL*
set
a
galley-slave
at
large
.
He
had
just
robbed
the
laws
of
a
man
who
*NL*
belonged
to
them
.
That
was
what
he
had
done
.
He
no
longer
understood
*NL*
himself
.
The
very
reasons
for
his
action
escaped
him
;
only
their
vertigo
*NL*
was
left
with
him
.
Up
to
that
moment
he
had
lived
with
that
blind
faith
*NL*
which
gloomy
probity
engenders
.
This
faith
had
quitted
him
,
this
probity
*NL*
had
deserted
him
.
All
that
he
had
believed
in
melted
away
.
Truths
which
*NL*
he
did
not
wish
to
recognize
were
besieging
him
,
inexorably
.
Henceforth
,
*NL*
he
must
be
a
different
man
.
He
was
suffering
from
the
strange
pains
of
*NL*
a
conscience
abruptly
operated
on
for
the
cataract
.
He
saw
that
which
*NL*
it
was
repugnant
to
him
to
behold
.
He
felt
himself
emptied
,
useless
,
put
*NL*
out
of
joint
with
his
past
life
,
turned
out
,
dissolved
.
Authority
was
*NL*
dead
within
him
.
He
had
no
longer
any
reason
for
existing
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
terrible
situation
!
to
be
touched
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
granite
and
to
doubt
!
to
be
the
statue
of
Chastisement
cast
in
one
*NL*
piece
in
the
mould
of
the
law
,
and
suddenly
to
become
aware
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
one
cherishes
beneath
one
's
breast
of
bronze
something
absurd
*NL*
and
disobedient
which
almost
resembles
a
heart
!
To
come
to
the
pass
of
*NL*
returning
good
for
good
,
although
one
has
said
to
oneself
up
to
that
day
*NL*
that
that
good
is
evil
!
to
be
the
watch-dog
,
and
to
lick
the
intruder
's
*NL*
hand
!
to
be
ice
and
melt
!
to
be
the
pincers
and
to
turn
into
a
hand
!
*NL*
to
suddenly
feel
one
's
fingers
opening
!
to
relax
one
's
grip
,
--
what
a
*NL*
terrible
thing
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
man-projectile
no
longer
acquainted
with
his
route
and
retreating
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
obliged
to
confess
this
to
oneself
:
infallibility
is
not
*NL*
infallible
,
there
may
exist
error
in
the
dogma
,
all
has
not
been
said
*NL*
when
a
code
speaks
,
society
is
not
perfect
,
authority
is
complicated
*NL*
with
vacillation
,
a
crack
is
possible
in
the
immutable
,
judges
are
but
*NL*
men
,
the
law
may
err
,
tribunals
may
make
a
mistake
!
to
behold
a
rift
in
*NL*
the
immense
blue
pane
of
the
firmament
!
*NL*
*NL*
That
which
was
passing
in
Javert
was
the
Fampoux
of
a
rectilinear
*NL*
conscience
,
the
derailment
of
a
soul
,
the
crushing
of
a
probity
which
*NL*
had
been
irresistibly
launched
in
a
straight
line
and
was
breaking
*NL*
against
God
.
It
certainly
was
singular
that
the
stoker
of
order
,
that
*NL*
the
engineer
of
authority
,
mounted
on
the
blind
iron
horse
with
its
*NL*
rigid
road
,
could
be
unseated
by
a
flash
of
light
!
that
the
immovable
,
*NL*
the
direct
,
the

the
geometrical

the
passive

the
perfect

*NL*
could
bend
!
that
there
should
exist
for
the
locomotive
a
road
to
*NL*
Damascus
!
*NL*
*NL*
God
,
always
within
man
,
and
refractory
,
He
,
the
true
conscience
,
to
the
*NL*
false
;
a
prohibition
to
the
spark
to
die
out
;
an
order
to
the
ray
to
*NL*
remember
the
sun
;
an
injunction
to
the
soul
to
recognize
the
veritable
*NL*
absolute
when
confronted
with
the
fictitious
absolute
,
humanity
*NL*
which
can
not
be
lost
;
the
human
heart
indestructible
;
that
splendid
*NL*
phenomenon
,
the
finest
,
perhaps
,
of
all
our
interior
marvels
,
did
Javert
*NL*
understand
this
?
Did
Javert
penetrate
it
?
Did
Javert
account
for
it
*NL*
to
himself
?
Evidently
he
did
not
.
But
beneath
the
pressure
of
that
*NL*
incontestable
incomprehensibility
he
felt
his
brain
bursting
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
less
the
man
transfigured
than
the
victim
of
this
prodigy
.
In
all
*NL*
this
he
perceived
only
the
tremendous
difficulty
of
existence
.
It
seemed
*NL*
to
him
that
,
henceforth
,
his
respiration
was
repressed
forever
.
He
was
*NL*
not
accustomed
to
having
something
unknown
hanging
over
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
this
point
,
everything
above
him
had
been
,
to
his
gaze
,
merely
a
*NL*
smooth
,
limpid
and
simple
surface
;
there
was
nothing
incomprehensible
,
*NL*
nothing
obscure
;
nothing
that
was
not
defined
,
regularly
disposed
,
*NL*
linked
,
precise
,
circumscribed
,
exact
,
limited
,
closed
,
fully
provided
*NL*
for
;
authority
was
a
plane
surface
;
there
was
no
fall
in
it
,
no
*NL*
dizziness
in
its
presence
.
Javert
had
never
beheld
the
unknown
except
*NL*
from
below
.
The
irregular
,
the
unforeseen
,
the
disordered
opening
of
*NL*
chaos
,
the
possible
slip
over
a
precipice
--
this
was
the
work
of
the
*NL*
lower
regions
,
of
rebels
,
of
the
wicked
,
of
wretches
.
Now
Javert
threw
*NL*
himself
back
,
and
he
was
suddenly
terrified
by
this
unprecedented
*NL*
apparition
:
a
gulf
on
high
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
!
one
was
dismantled
from
top
to
bottom
!
one
was
disconcerted
,
*NL*
absolutely
!
In
what
could
one
trust
!
That
which
had
been
agreed
upon
was
*NL*
giving
way
!
What
!
the
defect
in
society
's
armor
could
be
discovered
by
*NL*
a
magnanimous
wretch
!
What
!
an
honest
servitor
of
the
law
could
suddenly
*NL*
find
himself
caught
between
two
crimes
--
the
crime
of
allowing
a
man
to
*NL*
escape
and
the
crime
of
arresting
him
!
everything
was
not
settled
in
*NL*
the
orders
given
by
the
State
to
the
functionary
!
There
might
be
*NL*
blind
alleys
in
duty
!
What
,
--
all
this
was
real
!
was
it
true
that
an
*NL*
ex-ruffian
,
weighed
down
with
convictions
,
could
rise
erect
and
end
by
*NL*
being
in
the
right
?
Was
this
credible
?
were
there
cases
in
which
the
law
*NL*
should
retire
before
transfigured
crime
,
and
stammer
its
excuses
?
--
Yes
,
*NL*
that
was
the
state
of
the
case
!
and
Javert
saw
it
!
and
Javert
had
*NL*
touched
it
!
and
not
only
could
he
not
deny
it
,
but
he
had
taken
part
*NL*
in
it
.
These
were
realities
.
It
was
abominable
that
actual
facts
could
*NL*
reach
such
deformity
.
If
facts
did
their
duty
,
they
would
confine
*NL*
themselves
to
being
proofs
of
the
law
;
facts
--
it
is
God
who
sends
them
.
*NL*
Was
anarchy
,
then
,
on
the
point
of
now
descending
from
on
high
?
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
--
and
in
the
exaggeration
of
anguish
,
and
the
optical
illusion
*NL*
of
consternation
,
all
that
might
have
corrected
and
restrained
this
*NL*
impression
was
effaced
,
and
society
,
and
the
human
race
,
and
the
*NL*
universe
were
,
henceforth
,
summed
up
in
his
eyes
,
in
one
simple
and
*NL*
terrible
feature
,
--
thus
the
penal
laws
,
the
thing
judged
,
the
force
due
*NL*
to
legislation
,
the
decrees
of
the
sovereign
courts
,
the
magistracy
,
*NL*
the
government
,
prevention
,
repression
,
official
cruelty
,
wisdom
,
legal
*NL*
infallibility
,
the
principle
of
authority
,
all
the
dogmas
on
which
rest
*NL*
political
and
civil
security
,
sovereignty
,
justice
,
public
truth
,
all
*NL*
this
was
rubbish
,
a
shapeless
mass
,
chaos
;
he
himself
,
Javert
,
the
spy
*NL*
of
order
,
incorruptibility
in
the
service
of
the
police
,
the
bull-dog
*NL*
providence
of
society
,
vanquished
and
hurled
to
earth
;
and
,
erect
,
at
*NL*
the
summit
of
all
that
ruin
,
a
man
with
a
green
cap
on
his
head
and
a
*NL*
halo
round
his
brow
;
this
was
the
astounding
confusion
to
which
he
had
*NL*
come
;
this
was
the
fearful
vision
which
he
bore
within
his
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
this
to
be
endured
?
No
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
violent
state
,
if
ever
such
existed
.
There
were
only
two
ways
of
*NL*
escaping
from
it
.
One
was
to
go
resolutely
to
Jean
Valjean
,
and
restore
*NL*
to
his
cell
the
convict
from
the
galleys
.
The
other
...
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
quitted
the
parapet
,
and
,
with
head
erect
this
time
,
betook
*NL*
himself
,
with
a
firm
tread
,
towards
the
station-house
indicated
by
a
*NL*
lantern
at
one
of
the
corners
of
the
Place
du
Chatelet
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
arriving
there
,
he
saw
through
the
window
a
sergeant
of
police
,
and
*NL*
he
entered
.
Policemen
recognize
each
other
by
the
very
way
in
which
they
*NL*
open
the
door
of
a
station-house
.
Javert
mentioned
his
name
,
showed
his
*NL*
card
to
the
sergeant
,
and
seated
himself
at
the
table
of
the
post
on
*NL*
which
a
candle
was
burning
.
On
a
table
lay
a
pen
,
a
leaden
inkstand
and
*NL*
paper
,
provided
in
the
event
of
possible
reports
and
the
orders
of
the
*NL*
night
patrols
.
This
table
,
still
completed
by
its
straw-seated
chair
,
*NL*
is
an
institution
;
it
exists
in
all
police
stations
;
it
is
invariably
*NL*
ornamented
with
a
box-wood
saucer
filled
with
sawdust
and
a
wafer
box
*NL*
of
cardboard
filled
with
red
wafers
,
and
it
forms
the
lowest
stage
of
*NL*
official
style
.
It
is
there
that
the
literature
of
the
State
has
its
*NL*
beginning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
took
a
pen
and
a
sheet
of
paper
,
and
began
to
write
.
This
is
what
*NL*
he
wrote
:
*NL*
*NL*
A
FEW
OBSERVATIONS
FOR
THE
GOOD
OF
THE
SERVICE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
:
I
beg
Monsieur
le
Prefet
to
cast
his
eyes
*NL*
on
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Secondly
:
prisoners
,
on
arriving
after
examination
,
take
off
*NL*
their
shoes
and
stand
barefoot
on
the
flagstones
while
they
are
*NL*
being
searched
.
Many
of
them
cough
on
their
return
to
prison
.
*NL*
This
entails
hospital
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thirdly
:
the
mode
of
keeping
track
of
a
man
with
relays
of
police
*NL*
agents
from
distance
to
distance
,
is
good
,
but
,
on
important
occasions
,
*NL*
it
is
requisite
that
at
least
two
agents
should
never
lose
sight
*NL*
of
each
other
,
so
that
,
in
case
one
agent
should
,
for
any
cause
,
*NL*
grow
weak
in
his
service
,
the
other
may
supervise
him
and
take
*NL*
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fourthly
:
it
is
inexplicable
why
the
special
regulation
of
the
prison
*NL*
of
the
Madelonettes
interdicts
the
prisoner
from
having
a
chair
,
*NL*
even
by
paying
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifthly
:
in
the
Madelonettes
there
are
only
two
bars
to
the
canteen
,
*NL*
so
that
the
canteen
woman
can
touch
the
prisoners
with
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixthly
:
the
prisoners
called
barkers
,
who
summon
the
other
*NL*
prisoners
to
the
parlor
,
force
the
prisoner
to
pay
them
two
sous
*NL*
to
call
his
name
distinctly
.
This
is
a
theft
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventhly
:
for
a
broken
thread
ten
sous
are
withheld
in
the
*NL*
weaving
shop
;
this
is
an
abuse
of
the
contractor
,
since
the
cloth
*NL*
is
none
the
worse
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eighthly
:
it
is
annoying
for
visitors
to
La
Force
to
be
*NL*
obliged
to
traverse
the
boys
'
court
in
order
to
reach
the
parlor
*NL*
of
Sainte-Marie-l'Egyptienne
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ninthly
:
it
is
a
fact
that
any
day
gendarmes
can
be
overheard
*NL*
relating
in
the
court-yard
of
the
prefecture
the
interrogations
put
*NL*
by
the
magistrates
to
prisoners
.
For
a
gendarme
,
who
should
be
*NL*
sworn
to
secrecy
,
to
repeat
what
he
has
heard
in
the
examination
*NL*
room
is
a
grave
disorder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tenthly
:
Mme.
Henry
is
an
honest
woman
;
her
canteen
is
very
neat
;
*NL*
but
it
is
bad
to
have
a
woman
keep
the
wicket
to
the
mouse-trap
*NL*
of
the
secret
cells
.
This
is
unworthy
of
the
Conciergerie
of
a
*NL*
great
civilization
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
wrote
these
lines
in
his
calmest
and
most
correct
chirography
,
*NL*
not
omitting
a
single
comma
,
and
making
the
paper
screech
under
his
pen
.
*NL*
Below
the
last
line
he
signed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
JAVERT
,
*NL*
``
Inspector
of
the
1st
class
.
*NL*
``
The
Post
of
the
Place
du
Chatelet
.
*NL*
``
June
7th
,
1832
,
about
one
o'clock
in
the
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
dried
the
fresh
ink
on
the
paper
,
folded
it
like
a
letter
,
sealed
*NL*
it
,
wrote
on
the
back
:
Note
for
the
administration
,
left
it
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
quitted
the
post
.
The
glazed
and
grated
door
fell
to
behind
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
traversed
the
Place
du
Chatelet
diagonally
,
regained
the
quay
,
*NL*
and
returned
with
automatic
precision
to
the
very
point
which
he
had
*NL*
abandoned
a
quarter
of
an
hour
previously
,
leaned
on
his
elbows
and
*NL*
found
himself
again
in
the
same
attitude
on
the
same
paving-stone
of
the
*NL*
parapet
.
He
did
not
appear
to
have
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
darkness
was
complete
.
It
was
the
sepulchral
moment
which
follows
*NL*
midnight
.
A
ceiling
of
clouds
concealed
the
stars
.
Not
a
single
light
*NL*
burned
in
the
houses
of
the
city
;
no
one
was
passing
;
all
of
the
streets
*NL*
and
quays
which
could
be
seen
were
deserted
;
Notre-Dame
and
the
towers
*NL*
of
the
Court-House
seemed
features
of
the
night
.
A
street
lantern
*NL*
reddened
the
margin
of
the
quay
.
The
outlines
of
the
bridges
lay
*NL*
shapeless
in
the
mist
one
behind
the
other
.
Recent
rains
had
swollen
the
*NL*
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spot
where
Javert
was
leaning
was
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
situated
*NL*
precisely
over
the
rapids
of
the
Seine
,
perpendicularly
above
that
*NL*
formidable
spiral
of
whirlpools
which
loose
and
knot
themselves
again
*NL*
like
an
endless
screw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
bent
his
head
and
gazed
.
All
was
black
.
Nothing
was
to
be
*NL*
distinguished
.
A
sound
of
foam
was
audible
;
but
the
river
could
not
be
*NL*
seen
.
At
moments
,
in
that
dizzy
depth
,
a
gleam
of
light
appeared
,
and
*NL*
undulated
vaguely
,
water
possessing
the
power
of
taking
light
,
no
one
*NL*
knows
whence
,
and
converting
it
into
a
snake
.
The
light
vanished
,
and
*NL*
all
became
indistinct
once
more
.
Immensity
seemed
thrown
open
there
.
*NL*
What
lay
below
was
not
water
,
it
was
a
gulf
.
The
wall
of
the
quay
,
*NL*
abrupt
,
confused
,
mingled
with
the
vapors
,
instantly
concealed
from
*NL*
sight
,
produced
the
effect
of
an
escarpment
of
the
infinite
.
Nothing
was
*NL*
to
be
seen
,
but
the
hostile
chill
of
the
water
and
the
stale
odor
of
*NL*
the
wet
stones
could
be
felt
.
A
fierce
breath
rose
from
this
abyss
.
The
*NL*
flood
in
the
river
,
divined
rather
than
perceived
,
the
tragic
whispering
*NL*
of
the
waves
,
the
melancholy
vastness
of
the
arches
of
the
bridge
,
the
*NL*
imaginable
fall
into
that
gloomy
void
,
into
all
that
shadow
was
full
of
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Javert
remained
motionless
for
several
minutes
,
gazing
at
this
opening
*NL*
of
shadow
;
he
considered
the
invisible
with
a
fixity
that
resembled
*NL*
attention
.
The
water
roared
.
All
at
once
he
took
off
his
hat
and
placed
*NL*
it
on
the
edge
of
the
quay
.
A
moment
later
,
a
tall
black
figure
,
which
*NL*
a
belated
passer-by
in
the
distance
might
have
taken
for
a
phantom
,
*NL*
appeared
erect
upon
the
parapet
of
the
quay
,
bent
over
towards
the
*NL*
Seine
,
then
drew
itself
up
again
,
and
fell
straight
down
into
the
*NL*
shadows
;
a
dull
splash
followed
;
and
the
shadow
alone
was
in
the
secret
*NL*
of
the
convulsions
of
that
obscure
form
which
had
disappeared
beneath
*NL*
the
water
.

CHAPTER
I
--
IN
WHICH
THE
TREE
WITH
THE
ZINC
PLASTER
APPEARS
AGAIN
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
the
events
which
we
have
just
recorded
,
Sieur
*NL*
Boulatruelle
experienced
a
lively
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sieur
Boulatruelle
was
that
road-mender
of
Montfermeil
whom
the
reader
*NL*
has
already
seen
in
the
gloomy
parts
of
this
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boulatruelle
,
as
the
reader
may
,
perchance
,
recall
,
was
a
man
who
*NL*
was
occupied
with
divers
and
troublesome
matters
.
He
broke
stones
and
*NL*
damaged
travellers
on
the
highway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Road-mender
and
thief
as
he
was
,
he
cherished
one
dream
;
he
believed
in
*NL*
the
treasures
buried
in
the
forest
of
Montfermeil
.
He
hoped
some
day
to
*NL*
find
the
money
in
the
earth
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
;
in
the
meanwhile
,
he
*NL*
lived
to
search
the
pockets
of
passers-by
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
for
an
instant
,
he
was
prudent
.
He
had
just
escaped
*NL*
neatly
.
He
had
been
,
as
the
reader
is
aware
,
picked
up
in
Jondrette
's
*NL*
garret
in
company
with
the
other
ruffians
.
Utility
of
a
vice
:
his
*NL*
drunkenness
had
been
his
salvation
.
The
authorities
had
never
been
able
*NL*
to
make
out
whether
he
had
been
there
in
the
quality
of
a
robber
or
a
*NL*
man
who
had
been
robbed
.
An
order
of
nolle
prosequi
,
founded
on
his
well
*NL*
authenticated
state
of
intoxication
on
the
evening
of
the
ambush
,
had
*NL*
set
him
at
liberty
.
He
had
taken
to
his
heels
.
He
had
returned
to
his
*NL*
road
from
Gagny
to
Lagny
,
to
make
,
under
administrative
supervision
,
*NL*
broken
stone
for
the
good
of
the
state
,
with
downcast
mien
,
in
a
very
*NL*
pensive
mood
,
his
ardor
for
theft
somewhat
cooled
;
but
he
was
addicted
*NL*
none
the
less
tenderly
to
the
wine
which
had
recently
saved
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
lively
emotion
which
he
had
experienced
a
short
time
after
*NL*
his
return
to
his
road-mender
's
turf-thatched
cot
,
here
it
is
:
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
Boulatruelle
,
while
on
his
way
as
was
his
wont
,
to
his
*NL*
work
,
and
possibly
also
to
his
ambush
,
a
little
before
daybreak
caught
*NL*
sight
,
through
the
branches
of
the
trees
,
of
a
man
,
whose
back
alone
*NL*
he
saw
,
but
the
shape
of
whose
shoulders
,
as
it
seemed
to
him
at
that
*NL*
distance
and
in
the
early
dusk
,
was
not
entirely
unfamiliar
to
him
.
*NL*
Boulatruelle
,
although
intoxicated
,
had
a
correct
and
lucid
memory
,
a
*NL*
defensive
arm
that
is
indispensable
to
any
one
who
is
at
all
in
conflict
*NL*
with
legal
order
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
the
deuce
have
I
seen
something
like
that
man
yonder
?
''
he
said
*NL*
to
himself
.
But
he
could
make
himself
no
answer
,
except
that
the
man
*NL*
resembled
some
one
of
whom
his
memory
preserved
a
confused
trace
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
apart
from
the
identity
which
he
could
not
manage
to
catch
,
*NL*
Boulatruelle
put
things
together
and
made
calculations
.
This
man
did
*NL*
not
belong
in
the
country-side
.
He
had
just
arrived
there
.
On
foot
,
*NL*
evidently
.
No
public
conveyance
passes
through
Montfermeil
at
that
hour
.
*NL*
He
had
walked
all
night
.
Whence
came
he
?
Not
from
a
very
great
distance
;
*NL*
for
he
had
neither
haversack
,
nor
bundle
.
From
Paris
,
no
doubt
.
Why
was
*NL*
he
in
these
woods
?
why
was
he
there
at
such
an
hour
?
what
had
he
come
*NL*
there
for
?
*NL*
*NL*
Boulatruelle
thought
of
the
treasure
.
By
dint
of
ransacking
his
memory
,
*NL*
he
recalled
in
a
vague
way
that
he
had
already
,
many
years
before
,
had
*NL*
a
similar
alarm
in
connection
with
a
man
who
produced
on
him
the
effect
*NL*
that
he
might
well
be
this
very
individual
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
deuce
,
''
said
Boulatruelle
,
``
I
'll
find
him
again
.
I
'll
discover
*NL*
the
parish
of
that
parishioner
.
This
prowler
of
Patron-Minette
has
a
*NL*
reason
,
and
I
'll
know
it
.
People
ca
n't
have
secrets
in
my
forest
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
have
a
finger
in
the
pie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
his
pick-axe
which
was
very
sharply
pointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
''
he
grumbled
,
``
is
something
that
will
search
the
earth
and
a
*NL*
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
as
one
knots
one
thread
to
another
thread
,
he
took
up
the
line
of
*NL*
march
at
his
best
pace
in
the
direction
which
the
man
must
follow
,
and
*NL*
set
out
across
the
thickets
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
compassed
a
hundred
strides
,
the
day
,
which
was
already
*NL*
beginning
to
break
,
came
to
his
assistance
.
Footprints
stamped
in
the
*NL*
sand
,
weeds
trodden
down
here
and
there
,
heather
crushed
,
young
branches
*NL*
in
the
brushwood
bent
and
in
the
act
of
straightening
themselves
up
*NL*
again
with
the
graceful
deliberation
of
the
arms
of
a
pretty
woman
who
*NL*
stretches
herself
when
she
wakes
,
pointed
out
to
him
a
sort
of
track
.
He
*NL*
followed
it
,
then
lost
it
.
Time
was
flying
.
He
plunged
deeper
into
the
*NL*
woods
and
came
to
a
sort
of
eminence
.
An
early
huntsman
who
was
passing
*NL*
in
the
distance
along
a
path
,
whistling
the
air
of
Guillery
,
suggested
*NL*
to
him
the
idea
of
climbing
a
tree
.
Old
as
he
was
,
he
was
agile
.
There
*NL*
stood
close
at
hand
a
beech-tree
of
great
size
,
worthy
of
Tityrus
and
of
*NL*
Boulatruelle
.
Boulatruelle
ascended
the
beech
as
high
as
he
was
able
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
was
a
good
one
.
On
scrutinizing
the
solitary
waste
on
the
side
*NL*
where
the
forest
is
thoroughly
entangled
and
wild
,
Boulatruelle
suddenly
*NL*
caught
sight
of
his
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hardly
had
he
got
his
eye
upon
him
when
he
lost
sight
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
entered
,
or
rather
,
glided
into
,
an
open
glade
,
at
a
*NL*
considerable
distance
,
masked
by
large
trees
,
but
with
which
*NL*
Boulatruelle
was
perfectly
familiar
,
on
account
of
having
noticed
,
near
*NL*
a
large
pile
of
porous
stones
,
an
ailing
chestnut-tree
bandaged
with
*NL*
a
sheet
of
zinc
nailed
directly
upon
the
bark
.
This
glade
was
the
one
*NL*
which
was
formerly
called
the
Blaru-bottom
.
The
heap
of
stones
,
destined
*NL*
for
no
one
knows
what
employment
,
which
was
visible
there
thirty
years
*NL*
ago
,
is
doubtless
still
there
.
Nothing
equals
a
heap
of
stones
in
*NL*
longevity
,
unless
it
is
a
board
fence
.
They
are
temporary
expedients
.
*NL*
What
a
reason
for
lasting
!
*NL*
*NL*
Boulatruelle
,
with
the
rapidity
of
joy
,
dropped
rather
than
descended
*NL*
from
the
tree
.
The
lair
was
unearthed
,
the
question
now
was
to
seize
the
*NL*
beast
.
That
famous
treasure
of
his
dreams
was
probably
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
no
small
matter
to
reach
that
glade
.
By
the
beaten
paths
,
which
*NL*
indulge
in
a
thousand
teasing
zigzags
,
it
required
a
good
quarter
of
an
*NL*
hour
.
In
a
bee-line
,
through
the
underbrush
,
which
is
peculiarly
dense
,
*NL*
very
thorny
,
and
very
aggressive
in
that
locality
,
a
full
half
hour
was
*NL*
necessary
.
Boulatruelle
committed
the
error
of
not
comprehending
this
.
*NL*
He
believed
in
the
straight
line
;
a
respectable
optical
illusion
which
*NL*
ruins
many
a
man
.
The
thicket
,
bristling
as
it
was
,
struck
him
as
the
*NL*
best
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
take
to
the
wolves
'
Rue
de
Rivoli
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boulatruelle
,
accustomed
to
taking
crooked
courses
,
was
on
this
occasion
*NL*
guilty
of
the
fault
of
going
straight
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
flung
himself
resolutely
into
the
tangle
of
undergrowth
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
to
deal
with
holly
bushes
,
nettles
,
hawthorns
,
eglantines
,
*NL*
thistles
,
and
very
irascible
brambles
.
He
was
much
lacerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
bottom
of
the
ravine
he
found
water
which
he
was
obliged
to
*NL*
traverse
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
reached
the
Blaru-bottom
,
after
the
lapse
of
forty
minutes
,
*NL*
sweating
,
soaked
,
breathless
,
scratched
,
and
ferocious
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
the
glade
.
Boulatruelle
rushed
to
the
heap
of
*NL*
stones
.
It
was
in
its
place
.
It
had
not
been
carried
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
man
,
he
had
vanished
in
the
forest
.
He
had
made
his
escape
.
*NL*
Where
?
in
what
direction
?
into
what
thicket
?
Impossible
to
guess
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
heartrending
to
say
,
there
,
behind
the
pile
of
stones
,
in
front
of
*NL*
the
tree
with
the
sheet
of
zinc
,
was
freshly
turned
earth
,
a
pick-axe
,
*NL*
abandoned
or
forgotten
,
and
a
hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hole
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thief
!
''
shrieked
Boulatruelle
,
shaking
his
fist
at
the
horizon
.

CHAPTER
II
--
MARIUS
,
EMERGING
FROM
CIVIL
WAR
,
MAKES
READY
FOR
DOMESTIC
*NL*
WAR
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
long
time
,
Marius
was
neither
dead
nor
alive
.
For
many
weeks
he
*NL*
lay
in
a
fever
accompanied
by
delirium
,
and
by
tolerably
grave
cerebral
*NL*
symptoms
,
caused
more
by
the
shocks
of
the
wounds
on
the
head
than
by
*NL*
the
wounds
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
repeated
Cosette
's
name
for
whole
nights
in
the
melancholy
loquacity
*NL*
of
fever
,
and
with
the
sombre
obstinacy
of
agony
.
The
extent
of
some
of
*NL*
the
lesions
presented
a
serious
danger
,
the
suppuration
of
large
wounds
*NL*
being
always
liable
to
become
re-absorbed
,
and
consequently
,
to
kill
*NL*
the
sick
man
,
under
certain
atmospheric
conditions
;
at
every
change
of
*NL*
weather
,
at
the
slightest
storm
,
the
physician
was
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Above
all
things
,
''
he
repeated
,
``
let
the
wounded
man
be
subjected
to
no
*NL*
emotion
.
''
The
dressing
of
the
wounds
was
complicated
and
difficult
,
*NL*
the
fixation
of
apparatus
and
bandages
by
cerecloths
not
having
been
*NL*
invented
as
yet
,
at
that
epoch
.
Nicolette
used
up
a
sheet
``
as
big
as
the
*NL*
ceiling
,
''
as
she
put
it
,
for
lint
.
It
was
not
without
difficulty
*NL*
that
the
chloruretted
lotions
and
the
nitrate
of
silver
overcame
the
*NL*
gangrene
.
As
long
as
there
was
any
danger
,
M.
Gillenormand
,
seated
in
*NL*
despair
at
his
grandson
's
pillow
,
was
,
like
Marius
,
neither
alive
nor
*NL*
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
,
sometimes
twice
a
day
,
a
very
well
dressed
gentleman
with
*NL*
white
hair
,
--
such
was
the
description
given
by
the
porter
,
--
came
to
*NL*
inquire
about
the
wounded
man
,
and
left
a
large
package
of
lint
for
the
*NL*
dressings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
on
the
7th
of
September
,
four
months
to
a
day
,
after
the
*NL*
sorrowful
night
when
he
had
been
brought
back
to
his
grandfather
in
a
*NL*
dying
condition
,
the
doctor
declared
that
he
would
answer
for
Marius
.
*NL*
Convalescence
began
.
But
Marius
was
forced
to
remain
for
two
months
more
*NL*
stretched
out
on
a
long
chair
,
on
account
of
the
results
called
up
by
*NL*
the
fracture
of
his
collar-bone
.
There
always
is
a
last
wound
like
that
*NL*
which
will
not
close
,
and
which
prolongs
the
dressings
indefinitely
,
to
*NL*
the
great
annoyance
of
the
sick
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
this
long
illness
and
this
long
convalescence
saved
him
*NL*
from
all
pursuit
.
In
France
,
there
is
no
wrath
,
not
even
of
a
public
*NL*
character
,
which
six
months
will
not
extinguish
.
Revolts
,
in
the
present
*NL*
state
of
society
,
are
so
much
the
fault
of
every
one
,
that
they
are
*NL*
followed
by
a
certain
necessity
of
shutting
the
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
add
,
that
the
inexcusable
Gisquet
order
,
which
enjoined
doctors
*NL*
to
lodge
information
against
the
wounded
,
having
outraged
public
*NL*
opinion
,
and
not
opinion
alone
,
but
the
King
first
of
all
,
the
wounded
*NL*
were
covered
and
protected
by
this
indignation
;
and
,
with
the
exception
*NL*
of
those
who
had
been
made
prisoners
in
the
very
act
of
combat
,
the
*NL*
councils
of
war
did
not
dare
to
trouble
any
one
.
So
Marius
was
left
in
*NL*
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
first
passed
through
all
manner
of
anguish
,
and
then
*NL*
through
every
form
of
ecstasy
.
It
was
found
difficult
to
prevent
his
*NL*
passing
every
night
beside
the
wounded
man
;
he
had
his
big
arm-chair
*NL*
carried
to
Marius
'
bedside
;
he
required
his
daughter
to
take
the
*NL*
finest
linen
in
the
house
for
compresses
and
bandages
.
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Gillenormand
,
like
a
sage
and
elderly
person
,
contrived
to
spare
the
*NL*
fine
linen
,
while
allowing
the
grandfather
to
think
that
he
was
obeyed
.
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
would
not
permit
any
one
to
explain
to
him
,
that
for
the
*NL*
preparation
of
lint
batiste
is
not
nearly
so
good
as
coarse
linen
,
*NL*
nor
new
linen
as
old
linen
.
He
was
present
at
all
the
dressings
of
the
*NL*
wounds
from
which
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
modestly
absented
herself
.
*NL*
When
the
dead
flesh
was
cut
away
with
scissors
,
he
said
:
``
Aie
!
aie
!
''
*NL*
Nothing
was
more
touching
than
to
see
him
with
his
gentle
,
senile
palsy
,
*NL*
offer
the
wounded
man
a
cup
of
his
cooling-draught
.
He
overwhelmed
the
*NL*
doctor
with
questions
.
He
did
not
observe
that
he
asked
the
same
ones
*NL*
over
and
over
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
day
when
the
doctor
announced
to
him
that
Marius
was
out
of
*NL*
danger
,
the
good
man
was
in
a
delirium
.
He
made
his
porter
a
present
of
*NL*
three
louis
.
That
evening
,
on
his
return
to
his
own
chamber
,
he
danced
*NL*
a
gavotte
,
using
his
thumb
and
forefinger
as
castanets
,
and
he
sang
the
*NL*
following
song
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jeanne
est
nee
a
Fougere
``
Amour
,
tu
vis
en
elle

*NL*
Vrai

thou
dwellest
in
her
;
For
't
is
in
her
eyes
that
thou
placest
thy
*NL*
quiver
,
sly
scamp
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
me
,
I
sing
her
,
and
I
love
,
more
than
Diana
herself
,
Jeanne
and
*NL*
her
firm
Breton
breasts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
knelt
upon
a
chair
,
and
Basque
,
who
was
watching
him
through
the
*NL*
half-open
door
,
made
sure
that
he
was
praying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
to
that
time
,
he
had
not
believed
in
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
each
succeeding
phase
of
improvement
,
which
became
more
and
more
*NL*
pronounced
,
the
grandfather
raved
.
He
executed
a
multitude
of
mechanical
*NL*
actions
full
of
joy
;
he
ascended
and
descended
the
stairs
,
without
*NL*
knowing
why
.
A
pretty
female
neighbor
was
amazed
one
morning
at
*NL*
receiving
a
big
bouquet
;
it
was
M.
Gillenormand
who
had
sent
it
to
*NL*
her
.
The
husband
made
a
jealous
scene
.
M.
Gillenormand
tried
to
draw
*NL*
Nicolette
upon
his
knees
.
He
called
Marius
,
``
M.
le
Baron
.
''
He
shouted
:
*NL*
``
Long
live
the
Republic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
moment
,
he
kept
asking
the
doctor
:
``
Is
he
no
longer
in
danger
?
''
*NL*
He
gazed
upon
Marius
with
the
eyes
of
a
grandmother
.
He
brooded
over
him
*NL*
while
he
ate
.
He
no
longer
knew
himself
,
he
no
longer
rendered
himself
*NL*
an
account
of
himself
.
Marius
was
the
master
of
the
house
,
there
was
*NL*
abdication
in
his
joy
,
he
was
the
grandson
of
his
grandson
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
state
of
joy
in
which
he
then
was
,
he
was
the
most
venerable
of
*NL*
children
.
In
his
fear
lest
he
might
fatigue
or
annoy
the
convalescent
,
*NL*
he
stepped
behind
him
to
smile
.
He
was
content
,
joyous
,
delighted
,
*NL*
charming
,
young
.
His
white
locks
added
a
gentle
majesty
to
the
gay
*NL*
radiance
of
his
visage
.
When
grace
is
mingled
with
wrinkles
,
it
is
*NL*
adorable
.
There
is
an
indescribable
aurora
in
beaming
old
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Marius
,
as
he
allowed
them
to
dress
his
wounds
and
care
for
him
,
*NL*
he
had
but
one
fixed
idea
:
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
fever
and
delirium
had
left
him
,
he
did
not
again
pronounce
*NL*
her
name
,
and
it
might
have
been
supposed
that
he
no
longer
thought
of
*NL*
her
.
He
held
his
peace
,
precisely
because
his
soul
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
know
what
had
become
of
Cosette
;
the
whole
affair
of
the
*NL*
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
was
like
a
cloud
in
his
memory
;
shadows
that
were
*NL*
almost
indistinct
,
floated
through
his
mind
,
Eponine
,
Gavroche
,
Mabeuf
,
*NL*
the
Thenardiers
,
all
his
friends
gloomily
intermingled
with
the
smoke
*NL*
of
the
barricade
;
the
strange
passage
of
M.
Fauchelevent
through
that
*NL*
adventure
produced
on
him
the
effect
of
a
puzzle
in
a
tempest
;
he
*NL*
understood
nothing
connected
with
his
own
life
,
he
did
not
know
how
nor
*NL*
by
whom
he
had
been
saved
,
and
no
one
of
those
around
him
knew
this
;
all
*NL*
that
they
had
been
able
to
tell
him
was
,
that
he
had
been
brought
home
*NL*
at
night
in
a
hackney-coach
,
to
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
;
past
,
*NL*
present
,
future
were
nothing
more
to
him
than
the
mist
of
a
vague
idea
;
*NL*
but
in
that
fog
there
was
one
immovable
point
,
one
clear
and
precise
*NL*
outline
,
something
made
of
granite
,
a
resolution
,
a
will
;
to
find
*NL*
Cosette
once
more
.
For
him
,
the
idea
of
life
was
not
distinct
from
the
*NL*
idea
of
Cosette
.
He
had
decreed
in
his
heart
that
he
would
not
accept
*NL*
the
one
without
the
other
,
and
he
was
immovably
resolved
to
exact
of
*NL*
any
person
whatever
,
who
should
desire
to
force
him
to
live
,
--
from
his
*NL*
grandfather
,
from
fate
,
from
hell
,
--
the
restitution
of
his
vanished
*NL*
Eden
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
conceal
from
himself
the
fact
that
obstacles
existed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
here
emphasize
one
detail
,
he
was
not
won
over
and
was
but
little
*NL*
softened
by
all
the
solicitude
and
tenderness
of
his
grandfather
.
In
*NL*
the
first
place
,
he
was
not
in
the
secret
;
then
,
in
his
reveries
of
*NL*
an
invalid
,
which
were
still
feverish
,
possibly
,
he
distrusted
this
*NL*
tenderness
as
a
strange
and
novel
thing
,
which
had
for
its
object
his
*NL*
conquest
.
He
remained
cold
.
The
grandfather
absolutely
wasted
his
poor
*NL*
old
smile
.
Marius
said
to
himself
that
it
was
all
right
so
long
as
he
,
*NL*
Marius
,
did
not
speak
,
and
let
things
take
their
course
;
but
that
when
*NL*
it
became
a
question
of
Cosette
,
he
would
find
another
face
,
and
that
*NL*
his
grandfather
's
true
attitude
would
be
unmasked
.
Then
there
would
*NL*
be
an
unpleasant
scene
;
a
recrudescence
of
family
questions
,
a
*NL*
confrontation
of
positions
,
every
sort
of
sarcasm
and
all
manner
of
*NL*
objections
at
one
and
the
same
time
,
Fauchelevent
,
Coupelevent
,
fortune
,
*NL*
poverty
,
a
stone
about
his
neck
,
the
future
.
Violent
resistance
;
*NL*
conclusion
:
a
refusal
.
Marius
stiffened
himself
in
advance
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
in
proportion
as
he
regained
life
,
the
old
ulcers
of
his
*NL*
memory
opened
once
more
,
he
reflected
again
on
the
past
,
Colonel
*NL*
Pontmercy
placed
himself
once
more
between
M.
Gillenormand
and
him
,
*NL*
Marius
,
he
told
himself
that
he
had
no
true
kindness
to
expect
from
*NL*
a
person
who
had
been
so
unjust
and
so
hard
to
his
father
.
And
*NL*
with
health
,
there
returned
to
him
a
sort
of
harshness
towards
his
*NL*
grandfather
.
The
old
man
was
gently
pained
by
this
.
M.
Gillenormand
,
*NL*
without
however
allowing
it
to
appear
,
observed
that
Marius
,
ever
since
*NL*
the
latter
had
been
brought
back
to
him
and
had
regained
consciousness
,
*NL*
had
not
once
called
him
father
.
It
is
true
that
he
did
not
say
*NL*
``
monsieur
''
to
him
;
but
he
contrived
not
to
say
either
the
one
or
the
*NL*
other
,
by
means
of
a
certain
way
of
turning
his
phrases
.
Obviously
,
a
*NL*
crisis
was
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
almost
always
happens
in
such
cases
,
Marius
skirmished
before
giving
*NL*
battle
,
by
way
of
proving
himself
.
This
is
called
``
feeling
the
ground
.
''
*NL*
One
morning
it
came
to
pass
that
M.
Gillenormand
spoke
slightingly
of
*NL*
the
Convention
,
apropos
of
a
newspaper
which
had
fallen
into
his
*NL*
hands
,
and
gave
vent
to
a
Royalist
harangue
on
Danton
,
Saint-Juste
and
*NL*
Robespierre
.
--
``
The
men
of
'93
were
giants
,
''
said
Marius
with
severity
.
*NL*
The
old
man
held
his
peace
,
and
uttered
not
a
sound
during
the
remainder
*NL*
of
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
who
had
always
present
to
his
mind
the
inflexible
grandfather
of
*NL*
his
early
years
,
interpreted
this
silence
as
a
profound
concentration
*NL*
of
wrath
,
augured
from
it
a
hot
conflict
,
and
augmented
his
preparations
*NL*
for
the
fray
in
the
inmost
recesses
of
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
decided
that
,
in
case
of
a
refusal
,
he
would
tear
off
his
bandages
,
*NL*
dislocate
his
collar-bone
,
that
he
would
lay
bare
all
the
wounds
which
*NL*
he
had
left
,
and
would
reject
all
food
.
His
wounds
were
his
munitions
of
*NL*
war
.
He
would
have
Cosette
or
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
awaited
the
propitious
moment
with
the
crafty
patience
of
the
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
moment
arrived
.

CHAPTER
III
--
MARIUS
ATTACKED
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
M.
Gillenormand
,
while
his
daughter
was
putting
in
order
the
*NL*
phials
and
cups
on
the
marble
of
the
commode
,
bent
over
Marius
and
said
*NL*
to
him
in
his
tenderest
accents
:
``
Look
here
,
my
little
Marius
,
if
I
were
*NL*
in
your
place
,
I
would
eat
meat
now
in
preference
to
fish
.
A
fried
sole
*NL*
is
excellent
to
begin
a
convalescence
with
,
but
a
good
cutlet
is
needed
*NL*
to
put
a
sick
man
on
his
feet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
who
had
almost
entirely
recovered
his
strength
,
collected
*NL*
the
whole
of
it
,
drew
himself
up
into
a
sitting
posture
,
laid
his
two
*NL*
clenched
fists
on
the
sheets
of
his
bed
,
looked
his
grandfather
in
the
*NL*
face
,
assumed
a
terrible
air
,
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
leads
me
to
say
something
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
wish
to
marry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Agreed
,
''
said
his
grandfather
.
--
And
he
burst
out
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
agreed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
agreed
.
You
shall
have
your
little
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
stunned
and
overwhelmed
with
the
dazzling
shock
,
trembled
in
*NL*
every
limb
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
shall
have
her
,
that
pretty
little
girl
of
yours
.
She
comes
*NL*
every
day
in
the
shape
of
an
old
gentleman
to
inquire
after
you
.
Ever
*NL*
since
you
were
wounded
,
she
has
passed
her
time
in
weeping
and
making
*NL*
lint
.
I
have
made
inquiries
.
She
lives
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
No.
*NL*
7
.
Ah
!
There
we
have
it
!
Ah
!
so
you
want
her
!
Well
,
you
shall
have
*NL*
her
.
You
're
caught
.
You
had
arranged
your
little
plot
,
you
had
said
to
*NL*
yourself
:
--
`
I
'm
going
to
signify
this
squarely
to
my
grandfather
,
to
*NL*
that
mummy
of
the
Regency
and
of
the
Directory
,
to
that
ancient
beau
,
*NL*
to
that
Dorante
turned
Geronte
;
he
has
indulged
in
his
frivolities
also
,
*NL*
that
he
has
,
and
he
has
had
his
love
affairs
,
and
his
grisettes
and
his
*NL*
Cosettes
;
he
has
made
his
rustle
,
he
has
had
his
wings
,
he
has
eaten
of
*NL*
the
bread
of
spring
;
he
certainly
must
remember
it
.
'
Ah
!
you
take
the
*NL*
cockchafer
by
the
horns
.
That
's
good
.
I
offer
you
a
cutlet
and
you
*NL*
answer
me
:
`
By
the
way
,
I
want
to
marry
.
'
There
's
a
transition
for
*NL*
you
!
Ah
!
you
reckoned
on
a
bickering
!
You
do
not
know
that
I
am
an
old
*NL*
coward
.
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
You
are
vexed
?
You
did
not
expect
to
*NL*
find
your
grandfather
still
more
foolish
than
yourself
,
you
are
wasting
*NL*
the
discourse
which
you
meant
to
bestow
upon
me
,
Mr.
Lawyer
,
and
that
's
*NL*
vexatious
.
Well
,
so
much
the
worse
,
rage
away
.
I
'll
do
whatever
*NL*
you
wish
,
and
that
cuts
you
short
,
imbecile
!
Listen
.
I
have
made
my
*NL*
inquiries
,
I
'm
cunning
too
;
she
is
charming
,
she
is
discreet
,
it
is
not
*NL*
true
about
the
lancer
,
she
has
made
heaps
of
lint
,
she
's
a
jewel
,
she
*NL*
adores
you
,
if
you
had
died
,
there
would
have
been
three
of
us
,
her
*NL*
coffin
would
have
accompanied
mine
.
I
have
had
an
idea
,
ever
since
you
*NL*
have
been
better
,
of
simply
planting
her
at
your
bedside
,
but
it
is
only
*NL*
in
romances
that
young
girls
are
brought
to
the
bedsides
of
handsome
*NL*
young
wounded
men
who
interest
them
.
It
is
not
done
.
What
would
your
*NL*
aunt
have
said
to
it
?
You
were
nude
three
quarters
of
the
time
,
my
good
*NL*
fellow
.
Ask
Nicolette
,
who
has
not
left
you
for
a
moment
,
if
there
was
*NL*
any
possibility
of
having
a
woman
here
.
And
then
,
what
would
the
doctor
*NL*
have
said
?
A
pretty
girl
does
not
cure
a
man
of
fever
.
In
short
,
it
's
*NL*
all
right
,
let
us
say
no
more
about
it
,
all
's
said
,
all
's
done
,
it
's
all
*NL*
settled
,
take
her
.
Such
is
my
ferocity
.
You
see
,
I
perceived
that
you
*NL*
did
not
love
me
.
I
said
to
myself
:
`
Here
now
,
I
have
my
little
Cosette
*NL*
right
under
my
hand
,
I
'm
going
to
give
her
to
him
,
he
will
be
obliged
*NL*
to
love
me
a
little
then
,
or
he
must
tell
the
reason
why
.
'
Ah
!
so
you
*NL*
thought
that
the
old
man
was
going
to
storm
,
to
put
on
a
big
voice
,
*NL*
to
shout
no
,
and
to
lift
his
cane
at
all
that
aurora
.
Not
a
bit
of
it
.
*NL*
Cosette
,
so
be
it
;
love
,
so
be
it
;
I
ask
nothing
better
.
Pray
take
the
*NL*
trouble
of
getting
married
,
sir
.
Be
happy
,
my
well-beloved
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
the
old
man
burst
forth
into
sobs
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
seized
Marius
'
head
,
and
pressed
it
with
both
arms
against
his
*NL*
breast
,
and
both
fell
to
weeping
.
This
is
one
of
the
forms
of
supreme
*NL*
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
''
cried
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
so
you
love
me
!
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
ineffable
moment
ensued
.
They
were
choking
and
could
not
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
the
old
man
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
!
his
mouth
is
unstopped
at
last
.
He
has
said
:
`
Father
'
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
disengaged
his
head
from
his
grandfather
's
arms
,
and
said
gently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
father
,

that
I
am
quite
well

it
seems
to
me
that
I
might
see

her

*NL*
``
Agreed
again

shall
see

to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

to-day

Let
it
be
to-day

You
have
called
me

worth

will
attend
to
it

hither

Agreed

I
tell
you

It
has
already
been
put
into

This
is
*NL*
the
ending
of
the
elegy
of
the
`
Jeune
Malade
'
by
Andre
Chenier
,
by
Andre
*NL*
Chenier
whose
throat
was
cut
by
the
ras
...
by
the
giants
of

''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
fancied
that
he
detected
a
faint
frown
on
the
part
of
*NL*
Marius
,
who
,
in
truth
,
as
we
must
admit
,
was
no
longer
listening
to
him
,
*NL*
and
who
was
thinking
far
more
of
Cosette
than
of
1793
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandfather
,
trembling
at
having
so
inopportunely
introduced
Andre
*NL*
Chenier
,
resumed
precipitately
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
his
throat
is
not
the
word
.
The
fact
is
that
the
great
*NL*
revolutionary
geniuses
,
who
were
not
malicious
,
that
is
incontestable
,
*NL*
who
were
heroes
,
pardi
!
found
that
Andre
Chenier
embarrassed
them
*NL*
somewhat
,
and
they
had
him
guillot
...
that
is
to
say
,
those
great
*NL*
men
on
the
7th
of
Thermidor
,
besought
Andre
Chenier
,
in
the
interests
of
*NL*
public
safety
,
to
be
so
good
as
to
go
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
,
clutched
by
the
throat
by
his
own
phrase
,
could
not
*NL*
proceed
.
Being
able
neither
to
finish
it
nor
to
retract
it
,
while
his
*NL*
daughter
arranged
the
pillow
behind
Marius
,
who
was
overwhelmed
with
so
*NL*
many
emotions
,
the
old
man
rushed
headlong
,
with
as
much
rapidity
as
*NL*
his
age
permitted
,
from
the
bed-chamber
,
shut
the
door
behind
him
,
and
,
*NL*
purple
,
choking
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
,
his
eyes
starting
from
his
*NL*
head
,
he
found
himself
nose
to
nose
with
honest
Basque
,
who
was
blacking
*NL*
boots
in
the
anteroom
.
He
seized
Basque
by
the
collar
,
and
shouted
full
*NL*
in
his
face
in
fury
:
--
``
By
the
hundred

CHAPTER
IV
--
MADEMOISELLE
GILLENORMAND
ENDS
BY
NO
LONGER
THINKING
IT
A
*NL*
BAD
THING
THAT
M.
FAUCHELEVENT
SHOULD
HAVE
ENTERED
WITH
SOMETHING
UNDER
*NL*
HIS
ARM
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
Marius
beheld
each
other
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
that
interview
was
like
we
decline
to
say
.
There
are
things
which
*NL*
one
must
not
attempt
to
depict
;
the
sun
is
one
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entire
family
,
including
Basque
and
Nicolette
,
were
assembled
in
*NL*
Marius
'
chamber
at
the
moment
when
Cosette
entered
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Precisely
at
that
moment
,
the
grandfather
was
on
the
point
of
blowing
*NL*
his
nose
;
he
stopped
short
,
holding
his
nose
in
his
handkerchief
,
and
*NL*
gazing
over
it
at
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
appeared
on
the
threshold
;
it
seemed
to
him
that
she
was
surrounded
*NL*
by
a
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adorable
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
blew
his
nose
noisily
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
intoxicated
,
delighted
,
frightened
,
in
heaven
.
She
was
as
*NL*
thoroughly
alarmed
as
any
one
can
be
by
happiness
.
She
stammered
all
*NL*
pale
,
yet
flushed
,
she
wanted
to
fling
herself
into
Marius
'
arms
,
and
*NL*
dared
not
.
Ashamed
of
loving
in
the
presence
of
all
these
people
.
People
*NL*
are
pitiless
towards
happy
lovers
;
they
remain
when
the
latter
most
*NL*
desire
to
be
left
alone
.
Lovers
have
no
need
of
any
people
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Cosette
,
and
behind
her
,
there
had
entered
a
man
with
white
hair
*NL*
who
was
grave
yet
smiling
,
though
with
a
vague
and
heartrending
smile
.
*NL*
It
was
``
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
''
;
it
was
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
well
dressed
,
as
the
porter
had
said
,
entirely
in
black
,
in
*NL*
perfectly
new
garments
,
and
with
a
white
cravat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
was
a
thousand
leagues
from
recognizing
in
this
correct
*NL*
bourgeois
,
in
this
probable
notary
,
the
fear-inspiring
bearer
of
the
*NL*
corpse
,
who
had
sprung
up
at
his
door
on
the
night
of
the
7th
of
June
,
*NL*
tattered
,
muddy
,
hideous
,
haggard
,
his
face
masked
in
blood
and
mire
,
*NL*
supporting
in
his
arms
the
fainting
Marius
;
still
,
his
porter
's
scent
*NL*
was
aroused
.
When
M.
Fauchelevent
arrived
with
Cosette
,
the
porter
had
*NL*
not
been
able
to
refrain
from
communicating
to
his
wife
this
aside
:
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
why
it
is
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
fancying
that
I
've
seen
that
face
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Fauchelevent
in
Marius
'
chamber
,
remained
apart
near
the
door
.
He
*NL*
had
under
his
arm
,
a
package
which
bore
considerable
resemblance
to
an
*NL*
octavo
volume
enveloped
in
paper
.
The
enveloping
paper
was
of
a
greenish
*NL*
hue
,
and
appeared
to
be
mouldy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
the
gentleman
always
have
books
like
that
under
his
arm
?
''
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
,
who
did
not
like
books
,
demanded
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
of
Nicolette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
retorted
M.
Gillenormand
,
who
had
overheard
her
,
in
the
same
*NL*
tone
,
``
he
's
a
learned
man
.
What
then
?
Is
that
his
fault
?
Monsieur
*NL*
Boulard
,
one
of
my
acquaintances
,
never
walked
out
without
a
book
under
*NL*
his
arm
either
,
and
he
always
had
some
old
volume
hugged
to
his
heart
*NL*
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
with
a
bow
,
he
said
aloud
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Tranchelevent
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
did
not
do
it
intentionally
,
but
inattention
to
*NL*
proper
names
was
an
aristocratic
habit
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Tranchelevent
,
I
have
the
honor
of
asking
you
,
on
behalf
of
my
*NL*
grandson
,
Baron
Marius
Pontmercy
,
for
the
hand
of
Mademoiselle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Monsieur
Tranchelevent
bowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
settled
,
''
said
the
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
turning
to
Marius
and
Cosette
,
with
both
arms
extended
in
blessing
,
*NL*
he
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Permission
to
adore
each
other
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
require
him
to
repeat
it
twice
.
So
much
the
worse
!
the
*NL*
chirping
began
.
They
talked
low
.
Marius
,
resting
on
his
elbow
on
his
*NL*
reclining
chair
,
Cosette
standing
beside
him
.
``
Oh
,
heavens
!
''
murmured
*NL*
Cosette
,
``
I
see
you
once
again
!
it
is
thou
!
it
is
you
!
The
idea
of
going
*NL*
and
fighting
like
that
!
But
why
?
It
is
horrible
.
I
have
been
dead
for
*NL*
four
months
.
Oh
!
how
wicked
it
was
of
you
to
go
to
that
battle
!
What
had
*NL*
I
done
to
you
?
I
pardon
you
,
but
you
will
never
do
it
again
.
A
little
*NL*
while
ago
,
when
they
came
to
tell
us
to
come
to
you
,
I
still
thought
*NL*
that
I
was
about
to
die
,
but
it
was
from
joy
.
I
was
so
sad
!
I
have
not
*NL*
taken
the
time
to
dress
myself
,
I
must
frighten
people
with
my
looks
!
*NL*
What
will
your
relatives
say
to
see
me
in
a
crumpled
collar
?
Do
speak
!
*NL*
You
let
me
do
all
the
talking
.
We
are
still
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
.
*NL*
It
seems
that
your
shoulder
was
terrible
.
They
told
me
that
you
could
*NL*
put
your
fist
in
it
.
And
then
,
it
seems
that
they
cut
your
flesh
with
*NL*
the
scissors
.
That
is
frightful
.
I
have
cried
till
I
have
no
eyes
left
.
*NL*
It
is
queer
that
a
person
can
suffer
like
that
.
Your
grandfather
has
a
*NL*
very
kindly
air
.
Do
n't
disturb
yourself
,
do
n't
rise
on
your
elbow
,
you
*NL*
will
injure
yourself
.
Oh
!
how
happy
I
am
!
So
our
unhappiness
is
over
!
*NL*
I
am
quite
foolish
.
I
had
things
to
say
to
you
,
and
I
no
longer
know
in
*NL*
the
least
what
they
were
.
Do
you
still
love
me
?
We
live
in
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
.
There
is
no
garden
.
I
made
lint
all
the
time
;
stay
,
sir
,
*NL*
look
,
it
is
your
fault
,
I
have
a
callous
on
my
fingers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Angel
!
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Angel
is
the
only
word
in
the
language
which
can
not
be
worn
out
.
No
*NL*
other
word
could
resist
the
merciless
use
which
lovers
make
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
as
there
were
spectators
,
they
paused
and
said
not
a
word
more
,
*NL*
contenting
themselves
with
softly
touching
each
other
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
turned
towards
those
who
were
in
the
room
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
loud
,
the
rest
of
you
.
Make
a
noise
,
you
people
behind
the
scenes
.
*NL*
Come
,
a
little
uproar
,
the
deuce
!
so
that
the
children
can
chatter
at
*NL*
their
ease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
approaching
Marius
and
Cosette
,
he
said
to
them
in
a
very
low
*NL*
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
each
other
thou
.
Do
n't
stand
on
ceremony
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Gillenormand
looked
on
in
amazement
at
this
irruption
of
light
*NL*
in
her
elderly
household
.
There
was
nothing
aggressive
about
this
*NL*
amazement
;
it
was
not
the
least
in
the
world
like
the
scandalized
and
*NL*
envious
glance
of
an
owl
at
two
turtle-doves
,
it
was
the
stupid
eye
of
a
*NL*
poor
innocent
seven
and
fifty
years
of
age
;
it
was
a
life
which
had
been
*NL*
a
failure
gazing
at
that
triumph
,
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
senior
,
''
said
her
father
to
her
,
``
I
told
you
*NL*
that
this
is
what
would
happen
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
silent
for
a
moment
,
and
then
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
the
happiness
of
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
to
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
pretty
she
is
!
how
pretty
she
is
!
She
's
a
Greuze
.
So
you
are
going
*NL*
to
have
that
all
to
yourself
,
you
scamp
!
Ah
!
my
rogue
,
you
are
getting
*NL*
off
nicely
with
me
,
you
are
happy
;
if
I
were
not
fifteen
years
too
old
,
*NL*
we
would
fight
with
swords
to
see
which
of
us
should
have
her
.
Come
now
!
*NL*
I
am
in
love
with
you
,
mademoiselle
.
It
's
perfectly
simple
.
It
is
your
*NL*
right
.
You
are
in
the
right
.
Ah
!
what
a
sweet
,
charming
little
wedding
*NL*
this
will
make
!
Our
parish
is
Saint-Denis
du
Saint
Sacrament
,
but
I
will
*NL*
get
a
dispensation
so
that
you
can
be
married
at
Saint-Paul
.
The
church
*NL*
is
better
.
It
was
built
by
the
Jesuits
.
It
is
more
coquettish
.
It
is
*NL*
opposite
the
fountain
of
Cardinal
de
Birague
.
The
masterpiece
of
Jesuit
*NL*
architecture
is
at
Namur
.
It
is
called
Saint-Loup
.
You
must
go
there
*NL*
after
you
are
married
.
It
is
worth
the
journey
.
Mademoiselle
,
I
am
quite
*NL*
of
your
mind
,
I
think
girls
ought
to
marry
;
that
is
what
they
are
made
*NL*
for
.
There
is
a
certain
Sainte-Catherine
whom
I
should
always
like
to
*NL*
see
uncoiffed
.

It
's
a
fine
thing
to
remain
a
spinster
,
but
it
is
*NL*
chilly
.
The
Bible
says
:
Multiply
.
In
order
to
save
the
people

Jeanne
*NL*
d'Arc
is
needed
;
but
in
order
to
make
people

what
is
needed
is
Mother
*NL*
Goose
.
So
,
marry
,
my
beauties
.
I
really
do
not
see
the
use
in
remaining
*NL*
a
spinster
!
I
know
that
they
have
their
chapel
apart
in
the
church
,
*NL*
and
that
they
fall
back
on
the
Society
of
the
Virgin
;

sapristi

a
*NL*
handsome
husband
,
a
fine
fellow

and
at
the
expiration
of
a

a
*NL*
big
,
blond
brat
who
nurses
lustily
,
and
who
has
fine
rolls
of
fat
on
his
*NL*
thighs
,
and
who
musses
up
your
breast
in
handfuls
with
his
little
rosy
*NL*
paws
,
laughing
the
while
like
the
dawn
,
--
that
's
better
than
holding
a
*NL*
candle
at
vespers
,
and
chanting
Turris
eburnea

*NL*
The
grandfather
executed
a
pirouette
on
his
eighty-year-old
heels

began

again

He
seated
himself
near
them
,
made
Cosette
sit
down
,
and
took
their
four
*NL*
hands
in
his
aged
and
wrinkled
hands
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
exquisite
,
this
darling
.
She
's
a
masterpiece
,
this
Cosette
!
*NL*
She
is
a
very
little
girl
and
a
very
great
lady
.
She
will
only
be
a
*NL*
Baroness
,
which
is
a
come
down
for
her
;
she
was
born
a
Marquise
.
What
*NL*
eyelashes
she
has
!
Get
it
well
fixed
in
your
noddles
,
my
children
,
that
*NL*
you
are
in
the
true
road
.
Love
each
other
.
Be
foolish
about
it
.
Love
is
*NL*
the
folly
of
men
and
the
wit
of
God
.
Adore
each
other
.
Only
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
suddenly
becoming
gloomy
,
``
what
a
misfortune
!
It
has
just
occurred
to
*NL*
me
!
More
than
half
of
what
I
possess
is
swallowed
up
in
an
annuity
;
so
*NL*
long
as
I
live
,
it
will
not
matter
,
but
after
my
death
,
a
score
of
years
*NL*
hence
,
ah
!
my
poor
children
,
you
will
not

Your

him
by

At
this
point
they
heard
a
grave
and
tranquil
voice
say
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
Euphrasie
Fauchelevent
possesses
six
hundred
thousand
*NL*
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
voice
of
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
he
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
,
no
one
seemed
to
be
aware
that
*NL*
he
was
there
,
and
he
had
remained
standing
erect
and
motionless
,
behind
*NL*
all
these
happy
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
Mademoiselle
Euphrasie
to
do
with
the
question
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
startled
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
she
,
''
replied
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
hundred
thousand
francs

''
resumed
M.
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Minus
fourteen
or
fifteen
thousand
francs
,
possibly
,
''
said
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
laid
on
the
table
the
package
which
Mademoiselle
Gillenormand
had
*NL*
mistaken
for
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
himself
opened
the
package
;
it
was
a
bundle
of
bank-notes
.
*NL*
They
were
turned
over
and
counted
.
There
were
five
hundred
notes
for
a
*NL*
thousand
francs
each
,
and
one
hundred
and
sixty-eight
of
five
hundred
.
*NL*
In
all
,
five
hundred
and
eighty-four
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is

said
M.
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five

murmured
the
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
arranges
things
well

it
not

Mademoiselle

said
the

``

As
for
Marius

Cosette

they
were
gazing

CHAPTER

--
DEPOSIT
YOUR
MONEY
IN
A
FOREST
RATHER
THAN
WITH
A
NOTARY
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
has
,
no
doubt
,
understood
,
without
necessitating
a
lengthy
*NL*
explanation
,
that
Jean
Valjean
,
after
the
Champmathieu
affair
,
had
been
*NL*
able
,
thanks
to
his
first
escape
of
a
few
days
'
duration
,
to
come
to
*NL*
Paris
and
to
withdraw
in
season
,
from
the
hands
of
Laffitte
,
the
*NL*
sum
earned
by
him
,
under
the
name
of
Monsieur
Madeleine
,
at
*NL*
Montreuil-sur-Mer
;
and
that
fearing
that
he
might
be
recaptured
,
--
which
*NL*
eventually
happened
--
he
had
buried
and
hidden
that
sum
in
the
forest
*NL*
of
Montfermeil
,
in
the
locality
known
as
the
Blaru-bottom
.
The
sum
,
*NL*
six
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
francs
,
all
in
bank-bills
,
was
not
very
*NL*
bulky
,
and
was
contained
in
a
box
;
only
,
in
order
to
preserve
the
*NL*
box
from
dampness
,
he
had
placed
it
in
a
coffer
filled
with
chestnut
*NL*
shavings
.
In
the
same
coffer
he
had
placed
his
other
treasures
,
the
*NL*
Bishop
's
candlesticks
.
It
will
be
remembered
that
he
had
carried
off
*NL*
the
candlesticks
when
he
made
his
escape
from
Montreuil-sur-Mer
.
The
man
*NL*
seen
one
evening
for
the
first
time
by
Boulatruelle
,
was
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
Later
on
,
every
time
that
Jean
Valjean
needed
money
,
he
went
to
get
it
*NL*
in
the
Blaru-bottom
.
Hence
the
absences
which
we
have
mentioned
.
He
had
*NL*
a
pickaxe
somewhere
in
the
heather
,
in
a
hiding-place
known
to
himself
*NL*
alone
.
When
he
beheld
Marius
convalescent
,
feeling
that
the
hour
was
at
*NL*
hand
,
when
that
money
might
prove
of
service
,
he
had
gone
to
get
it
;
*NL*
it
was
he
again
,
whom
Boulatruelle
had
seen
in
the
woods
,
but
on
*NL*
this
occasion
,
in
the
morning
instead
of
in
the
evening
.
Boulatreulle
*NL*
inherited
his
pickaxe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
actual
sum
was
five
hundred
and
eighty-four
thousand
,
five
hundred
*NL*
francs
.
Jean
Valjean
withdrew
the
five
hundred
francs
for
himself
.
--
``
We
*NL*
shall
see
hereafter
,
''
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
difference
between
that
sum
and
the
six
hundred
and
thirty
thousand
*NL*
francs
withdrawn
from
Laffitte
represented
his
expenditure
in
ten
years
,
*NL*
from
1823
to
1833
.
The
five
years
of
his
stay
in
the
convent
had
cost
*NL*
only
five
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
set
the
two
candlesticks
on
the
chimney-piece
,
where
they
*NL*
glittered
to
the
great
admiration
of
Toussaint
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Jean
Valjean
knew
that
he
was
delivered
from
Javert
.
The
*NL*
story
had
been
told
in
his
presence
,
and
he
had
verified
the
fact
in
*NL*
the
Moniteur
,
how
a
police
inspector
named
Javert
had
been
found
drowned
*NL*
under
a
boat
belonging
to
some
laundresses
,
between
the
Pont
au
Change
*NL*
and
the
Pont-Neuf
,
and
that
a
writing
left
by
this
man
,
otherwise
*NL*
irreproachable
and
highly
esteemed
by
his
superiors
,
pointed
to
a
fit
*NL*
of
mental
aberration
and
a
suicide
.
--
``
In
fact
,
''
thought
Jean
Valjean
,
*NL*
``
since
he
left
me
at
liberty
,
once
having
got
me
in
his
power
,
he
must
*NL*
have
been
already
mad
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
TWO
OLD
MEN
DO
EVERYTHING
,
EACH
ONE
AFTER
HIS
OWN
*NL*
FASHION
,
TO
RENDER
COSETTE
HAPPY
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
made
ready
for
the
wedding
.
The
doctor
,
on
being
*NL*
consulted
,
declared
that
it
might
take
place
in
February
.
It
was
then
*NL*
December
.
A
few
ravishing
weeks
of
perfect
happiness
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandfather
was
not
the
least
happy
of
them
all
.
He
remained
for
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
at
a
time
gazing
at
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wonderful
,
beautiful
girl
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
And
she
has
so
sweet
and
*NL*
good
an
air
!
she
is
,
without
exception
,
the
most
charming
girl
that
I
*NL*
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
.
Later
on
,
she
'll
have
virtues
with
an
odor
of
*NL*
violets
.
How
graceful
!
one
can
not
live
otherwise
than
nobly
with
such
*NL*
a
creature
.
Marius
,
my
boy
,
you
are
a
Baron
,
you
are
rich
,
do
n't
go
to
*NL*
pettifogging
,
I
beg
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
Marius
had
passed
abruptly
from
the
sepulchre
to
paradise
.
*NL*
The
transition
had
not
been
softened
,
and
they
would
have
been
stunned
,
*NL*
had
they
not
been
dazzled
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
understand
anything
about
it
?
''
said
Marius
to
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Cosette
,
``
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
good
God
is
caring
*NL*
for
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
did
everything
,
smoothed
away
every
difficulty
,
arranged
*NL*
everything
,
made
everything
easy
.
He
hastened
towards
Cosette
's
*NL*
happiness
with
as
much
ardor
,
and
,
apparently
with
as
much
joy
,
as
*NL*
Cosette
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
had
been
a
mayor
,
he
understood
how
to
solve
that
delicate
*NL*
problem
,
with
the
secret
of
which
he
alone
was
acquainted
,
Cosette
's
*NL*
civil
status
.
If
he
were
to
announce
her
origin
bluntly
,
it
might
*NL*
prevent
the
marriage
,
who
knows
?
He
extricated
Cosette
from
all
*NL*
difficulties
.
He
concocted
for
her
a
family
of
dead
people
,
a
sure
means
*NL*
of
not
encountering
any
objections
.
Cosette
was
the
only
scion
of
an
*NL*
extinct
family
;
Cosette
was
not
his
own
daughter
,
but
the
daughter
of
*NL*
the
other
Fauchelevent
.
Two
brothers
Fauchelevent
had
been
gardeners
to
*NL*
the
convent
of
the
Petit-Picpus
.
Inquiry
was
made
at
that
convent
;
the
*NL*
very
best
information
and
the
most
respectable
references
abounded
;
the
*NL*
good
nuns
,
not
very
apt
and
but
little
inclined
to
fathom
questions
of
*NL*
paternity
,
and
not
attaching
any
importance
to
the
matter
,
had
never
*NL*
understood
exactly
of
which
of
the
two
Fauchelevents
Cosette
was
the
*NL*
daughter
.
They
said
what
was
wanted
and
they
said
it
with
zeal
.
An
*NL*
acte
de
notoriete
was
drawn
up
.
Cosette
became
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
,
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Euphrasie
Fauchelevent
.
She
was
declared
an
orphan
,
both
*NL*
father
and
mother
being
dead
.
Jean
Valjean
so
arranged
it
that
he
was
*NL*
appointed
,
under
the
name
of
Fauchelevent
,
as
Cosette
's
guardian
,
with
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
as
supervising
guardian
over
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
five
hundred
and
eighty
thousand
francs
,
they
constituted
*NL*
a
legacy
bequeathed
to
Cosette
by
a
dead
person
,
who
desired
to
*NL*
remain
unknown
.
The
original
legacy
had
consisted
of
five
hundred
and
*NL*
ninety-four
thousand
francs
;
but
ten
thousand
francs
had
been
expended
*NL*
on
the
education
of
Mademoiselle
Euphrasie
,
five
thousand
francs
of
that
*NL*
amount
having
been
paid
to
the
convent
.
This
legacy
,
deposited
in
*NL*
the
hands
of
a
third
party
,
was
to
be
turned
over
to
Cosette
at
her
*NL*
majority
,
or
at
the
date
of
her
marriage
.
This
,
taken
as
a
whole
,
was
*NL*
very
acceptable
,
as
the
reader
will
perceive
,
especially
when
the
sum
*NL*
due
was
half
a
million
.
There
were
some
peculiarities
here
and
there
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
but
they
were
not
noticed
;
one
of
the
interested
parties
*NL*
had
his
eyes
blindfolded
by
love
,
the
others
by
the
six
hundred
thousand
*NL*
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
learned
that
she
was
not
the
daughter
of
that
old
man
whom
she
*NL*
had
so
long
called
father
.
He
was
merely
a
kinsman
;
another
Fauchelevent
*NL*
was
her
real
father
.
At
any
other
time
this
would
have
broken
her
heart
.
*NL*
But
at
the
ineffable
moment
which
she
was
then
passing
through
,
it
cast
*NL*
but
a
slight
shadow
,
a
faint
cloud
,
and
she
was
so
full
of
joy
that
the
*NL*
cloud
did
not
last
long
.
She
had
Marius
.
The
young
man
arrived
,
the
old
*NL*
man
was
effaced
;
such
is
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
then
,
Cosette
had
,
for
long
years
,
been
habituated
to
seeing
enigmas
*NL*
around
her
;
every
being
who
has
had
a
mysterious
childhood
is
always
*NL*
prepared
for
certain
renunciations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
she
continued
to
call
Jean
Valjean
:
Father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
happy
as
the
angels
,
was
enthusiastic
over
Father
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
It
is
true
that
he
overwhelmed
her
with
gallant
compliments
and
*NL*
presents
.
While
Jean
Valjean
was
building
up
for
Cosette
a
normal
*NL*
situation
in
society
and
an
unassailable
status
,
M.
Gillenormand
was
*NL*
superintending
the
basket
of
wedding
gifts
.
Nothing
so
amused
him
as
*NL*
being
magnificent
.
He
had
given
to
Cosette
a
robe
of
Binche
guipure
*NL*
which
had
descended
to
him
from
his
own
grandmother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
fashions
come
up
again
,
''
said
he
,
``
ancient
things
are
the
*NL*
rage
,
and
the
young
women
of
my
old
age
dress
like
the
old
women
of
my
*NL*
childhood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
rifled
his
respectable
chests
of
drawers
in
Coromandel
lacquer
,
with
*NL*
swelling
fronts
,
which
had
not
been
opened
for
years
.
--
``
Let
us
hear
the
*NL*
confession
of
these
dowagers
,
''
he
said
,
``
let
us
see
what
they
have
in
*NL*
their
paunches
.
''
He
noisily
violated
the
pot-bellied
drawers
of
all
*NL*
his
wives
,
of
all
his
mistresses
and
of
all
his
grandmothers
.

and

--
he
lavished
everything
on
*NL*
Cosette
.
Cosette
,
amazed
,
desperately
in
love
with
Marius
,
and
wild
with
*NL*
gratitude
towards
M.
Gillenormand
,
dreamed
of
a
happiness
without
limit
*NL*
clothed
in
satin
and
velvet
.
Her
wedding
basket
seemed
to
her
to
be
*NL*
upheld
by
seraphim
.
Her
soul
flew
out
into
the
azure
depths
,
with
wings
*NL*
of
Mechlin
lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intoxication
of
the
lovers
was
only
equalled
,
as
we
have
already
*NL*
said
,
by
the
ecstasy
of
the
grandfather
.
A
sort
of
flourish
of
trumpets
*NL*
went
on
in
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
,
a
fresh
offering
of
bric-a-brac
from
the
grandfather
to
*NL*
Cosette
.
All
possible
knickknacks
glittered
around
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Marius
,
who
was
fond
of
talking
gravely
in
the
midst
of
his
*NL*
bliss
,
said
,
apropos
of
I
know
not
what
incident
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
men
of
the
revolution
are
so
great
,
that
they
have
the
prestige
of
*NL*
the
ages
,
like
Cato
and
like
Phocion
,
and
each
one
of
them
seems
to
me
*NL*
an
antique
memory
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moire
antique
!
''
exclaimed
the
old
gentleman
.
``
Thanks
,
Marius
.
That
is
*NL*
precisely
the
idea
of
which
I
was
in
search
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
on
the
following
day
,
a
magnificent
dress
of
tea-rose
colored
moire
*NL*
antique
was
added
to
Cosette
's
wedding
presents
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
these
fripperies
,
the
grandfather
extracted
a
bit
of
wisdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
is
all
very
well
;
but
there
must
be
something
else
to
go
with
*NL*
it
.
The
useless
must
be
mingled
with
happiness
.
Happiness
is
only
the
*NL*
necessary
.
Season
that
enormously
with
the
superfluous
for
me
.
A
*NL*
palace
and
her
heart
.
Her
heart
and
the
Louvre
.
Her
heart
and
the
grand
*NL*
waterworks
of
Versailles
.
Give
me
my
shepherdess
and
try
to
make
her
a
*NL*
duchess
.
Fetch
me
Phyllis
crowned
with
corn-flowers
,
and
add
a
hundred
*NL*
thousand
francs
income
.
Open
for
me
a
bucolic
perspective
as
far
as
you
*NL*
can
see
,
beneath
a
marble
colonnade
.
I
consent
to
the
bucolic
and
also
*NL*
to
the
fairy
spectacle
of
marble
and
gold
.
Dry
happiness
resembles
dry
*NL*
bread
.
One
eats
,
but
one
does
not
dine
.
I
want
the
superfluous
,
the
*NL*
useless
,
the
extravagant
,
excess
,
that
which
serves
no
purpose
.
I
*NL*
remember
to
have
seen
,
in
the
Cathedral
of
Strasburg
,
a
clock
,
as
tall
*NL*
as
a
three-story
house
which
marked
the
hours
,
which
had
the
kindness
to
*NL*
indicate
the
hour
,
but
which
had
not
the
air
of
being
made
for
that
;
and
*NL*
which
,
after
having
struck
midday
,
or
midnight
,
--
midday
,
the
hour
of
the
*NL*
sun
,
or
midnight
,
the
hour
of
love
,
--
or
any
other
hour
that
you
like
,
*NL*
gave
you
the
moon
and
the
stars
,
the
earth
and
the
sea
,
birds
and
*NL*
fishes
,
Phoebus
and
Phoebe
,
and
a
host
of
things
which
emerged
from
a
*NL*
niche
,
and
the
twelve
apostles
,
and
the
Emperor
Charles
the
Fifth
,
and
*NL*
Eponine
,
and
Sabinus
,
and
a
throng
of
little
gilded
goodmen
,
who
played
*NL*
on
the
trumpet
to
boot
.
Without
reckoning
delicious
chimes
which
it
*NL*
sprinkled
through
the
air
,
on
every
occasion
,
without
any
one
's
knowing
*NL*
why
.
Is
a
petty
bald
clock-face
which
merely
tells
the
hour
equal
to
*NL*
that
?
For
my
part
,
I
am
of
the
opinion
of
the
big
clock
of
Strasburg
,
*NL*
and
I
prefer
it
to
the
cuckoo
clock
from
the
Black
Forest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
talked
nonsense
in
connection
with
the
wedding
,
and
all
*NL*
the
fripperies
of
the
eighteenth
century
passed
pell-mell
through
his
*NL*
dithyrambs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
ignorant
of
the
art
of
festivals
.
You
do
not
know
how
to
*NL*
organize
a
day
of
enjoyment
in
this
age
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Your
nineteenth
*NL*
century
is
weak
.
It
lacks
excess
.
It
ignores
the
rich
,
it
ignores
the
*NL*
noble
.
In
everything
it
is
clean-shaven
.
Your
third
estate
is
insipid
,
*NL*
colorless
,
odorless
,
and
shapeless
.
The
dreams
of
your
bourgeois
who
*NL*
set
up
,
as
they
express
it
:
a
pretty
boudoir
freshly
decorated
,
violet
,
*NL*
ebony
and
calico
.
Make
way
!
Make
way
!
the
Sieur
Curmudgeon
is
marrying
*NL*
Mademoiselle
Clutch-penny
.
Sumptuousness
and
splendor
.
A
louis
d'or
has
*NL*
been
stuck
to
a
candle
.
There
's
the
epoch
for
you
.
My
demand
is
that
I
*NL*
may
flee
from
it
beyond
the
Sarmatians
.
Ah
!
in
1787
,
I
predict
that
all
*NL*
was
lost
,
from
the
day
when
I
beheld
the
Duc
de
Rohan
,
Prince
de
Leon
,
*NL*
Duc
de
Chabot
,
Duc
de
Montbazon
,
Marquis
de
Sonbise
,
Vicomte
de
Thouars
,
*NL*
peer
of
France
,
go
to
Longchamps
in
a
tapecu
!
That
has
borne
its
fruits
.
*NL*
In
this
century
,
men
attend
to
business
,
they
gamble
on
`
Change
,
they
*NL*
win
money
,
they
are
stingy
.
People
take
care
of
their
surfaces
and
*NL*
varnish
them
;
every
one
is
dressed
as
though
just
out
of
a
band-box
,
*NL*
washed
,
soaped
,
scraped
,
shaved
,
combed
,
waked
,
smoothed
,
rubbed
,
*NL*
brushed
,
cleaned
on
the
outside
,
irreproachable
,
polished
as
a
pebble
,
*NL*
discreet
,
neat
,
and
at
the
same
time
,
death
of
my
life
,
in
the
depths
of
*NL*
their
consciences
they
have
dung-heaps
and
cesspools
that
are
enough
to
*NL*
make
a
cow-herd
who
blows
his
nose
in
his
fingers
,
recoil
.
I
grant
to
*NL*
this
age
the
device
:
`
Dirty
Cleanliness
.
'
Do
n't
be
vexed
,
Marius
,
give
*NL*
me
permission
to
speak
;
I
say
no
evil
of
the
people
as
you
see
,
I
am
*NL*
always
harping
on
your
people
,
but
do
look
favorably
on
my
dealing
a
bit
*NL*
of
a
slap
to
the
bourgeoisie
.
I
belong
to
it
.
He
who
loves
well
lashes
*NL*
well
.
Thereupon
,
I
say
plainly
,
that
now-a-days
people
marry
,
but
that
*NL*
they
no
longer
know
how
to
marry
.
Ah
!
it
is
true
,
I
regret
the
grace
*NL*
of
the
ancient
manners
.
I
regret
everything
about
them
,
their
elegance
,
*NL*
their
chivalry
,
those
courteous
and
delicate
ways
,
that
joyous
luxury
*NL*
which
every
one
possessed
,
music
forming
part
of
the
wedding
,
a
symphony
*NL*
above
stairs
,
a
beating
of
drums
below
stairs
,
the
dances
,
the
joyous
*NL*
faces
round
the
table
,
the
fine-spun
gallant
compliments
,
the
songs
,
the
*NL*
fireworks
,
the
frank
laughter
,
the
devil
's
own
row
,
the
huge
knots
of
*NL*
ribbon
.
I
regret
the
bride
's
garter
.
The
bride
's
garter
is
cousin
to
the
*NL*
girdle
of
Venus
.
On
what
does
the
war
of
Troy
turn
?
On
Helen
's
garter
,
*NL*
parbleu
!
Why
did
they
fight
,
why
did
Diomed
the
divine
break
over
*NL*
the
head
of
Meriones
that
great
brazen
helmet
of
ten
points
?
why
did
*NL*
Achilles
and
Hector
hew
each
other
up
with
vast
blows
of
their
lances
?
*NL*
Because
Helen
allowed
Paris
to
take
her
garter
.
With
Cosette
's
garter
,
*NL*
Homer
would
construct
the
Iliad
.
He
would
put
in
his
poem
,
a
loquacious
*NL*
old
fellow
,
like
me
,
and
he
would
call
him
Nestor
.
My
friends
,
in
bygone
*NL*
days
,
in
those
amiable
days
of
yore
,
people
married
wisely
;
they
had
a
*NL*
good
contract
,
and
then
they
had
a
good
carouse
.
As
soon
as
Cujas
had
*NL*
taken
his
departure
,
Gamacho
entered
.
But
,
in
sooth
!
the
stomach
is
*NL*
an
agreeable
beast
which
demands
its
due
,
and
which
wants
to
have
its
*NL*
wedding
also
.
People
supped
well
,
and
had
at
table
a
beautiful
neighbor
*NL*
without
a
guimpe
so
that
her
throat
was
only
moderately
concealed
.
Oh
!
*NL*
the
large
laughing
mouths
,
and
how
gay
we
were
in
those
days
!
youth
was
*NL*
a
bouquet
;
every
young
man
terminated
in
a
branch
of
lilacs
or
a
tuft
*NL*
of
roses
;
whether
he
was
a
shepherd
or
a
warrior
;
and
if
,
by
chance
,
*NL*
one
was
a
captain
of
dragoons
,
one
found
means
to
call
oneself
Florian
.
*NL*
People
thought
much
of
looking
well
.
They
embroidered
and
tinted
*NL*
themselves
.
A
bourgeois
had
the
air
of
a
flower
,
a
Marquis
had
the
air
*NL*
of
a
precious
stone
.
People
had
no
straps
to
their
boots
,
they
had
no
*NL*
boots
.
They
were
spruce
,
shining
,
waved
,
lustrous
,
fluttering
,
dainty
,
*NL*
coquettish
,
which
did
not
at
all
prevent
their
wearing
swords
by
their
*NL*
sides
.
The
humming-bird
has
beak
and
claws
.
That
was
the
day
of
the
*NL*
Galland
Indies
.
One
of
the
sides
of
that
century
was
delicate
,
the
other
*NL*
was
magnificent
;
and
by
the
green
cabbages
!
people
amused
themselves
.
*NL*
To-day
,
people
are
serious
.
The
bourgeois
is
avaricious
,
the
bourgeoise
*NL*
is
a
prude
;
your
century
is
unfortunate
.
People
would
drive
away
the
*NL*
Graces
as
being
too
low
in
the
neck
.
Alas
!
beauty
is
concealed
as
*NL*
though
it
were
ugliness
.
Since
the
revolution
,
everything
,
including
the
*NL*
ballet-dancers
,
has
had
its
trousers
;
a
mountebank
dancer
must
be
grave
;
*NL*
your
rigadoons
are
doctrinarian
.
It
is
necessary
to
be
majestic
.
People
*NL*
would
be
greatly
annoyed
if
they
did
not
carry
their
chins
in
their
*NL*
cravats
.
The
ideal
of
an
urchin
of
twenty
when
he
marries
,
is
to
*NL*
resemble
M.
Royer-Collard
.
And
do
you
know
what
one
arrives
at
with
*NL*
that
majesty
?
at
being
petty
.
Learn
this
:
joy
is
not
only
joyous
;
it
is
*NL*
great
.
But
be
in
love
gayly
then
,
what
the
deuce
!
marry
,
when
you
marry
,
*NL*
with
fever
and
giddiness
,
and
tumult
,
and
the
uproar
of
happiness
!
Be
*NL*
grave
in
church
,
well
and
good
.
But
,
as
soon
as
the
mass
is
finished
,
*NL*
sarpejou
!
you
must
make
a
dream
whirl
around
the
bride
.
A
marriage
*NL*
should
be
royal
and
chimerical
;
it
should
promenade
its
ceremony
from
*NL*
the
cathedral
of
Rheims
to
the
pagoda
of
Chanteloup
.
I
have
a
horror
*NL*
of
a
paltry
wedding
.
Ventregoulette
!
be
in
Olympus
for
that
one
day
,
*NL*
at
least
.
Be
one
of
the
gods
.
Ah
!
people
might
be
sylphs
.
Games
and
*NL*
Laughter
,
argiraspides
;
they
are
stupids
.
My
friends
,
every
recently
*NL*
made
bridegroom
ought
to
be
Prince
Aldobrandini
.
Profit
by
that
unique
*NL*
minute
in
life
to
soar
away
to
the
empyrean
with
the
swans
and
the
*NL*
eagles
,
even
if
you
do
have
to
fall
back
on
the
morrow
into
the
*NL*
bourgeoisie
of
the
frogs
.
Do
n't
economize
on
the
nuptials
,
do
not
prune
*NL*
them
of
their
splendors
;
do
n't
scrimp
on
the
day
when
you
beam
.
The
*NL*
wedding
is
not
the
housekeeping
.
Oh
!
if
I
were
to
carry
out
my
fancy
,
*NL*
it
would
be
gallant
,
violins
would
be
heard
under
the
trees
.
Here
is
*NL*
my
programme
:
sky-blue
and
silver
.
I
would
mingle
with
the
festival
*NL*
the
rural
divinities
,
I
would
convoke
the
Dryads
and
the
Nereids
.
The
*NL*
nuptials
of
Amphitrite
,
a
rosy
cloud
,
nymphs
with
well
dressed
locks
*NL*
and
entirely
naked
,
an
Academician
offering
quatrains
to
the
goddess
,
a
*NL*
chariot
drawn
by
marine
monsters
.

*NL*

While
the
grandfather
,
in
full
lyrical
effusion
,
was
listening
to
*NL*
himself
,
Cosette
and
Marius
grew
intoxicated
as
they
gazed
freely
at
*NL*
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Gillenormand
surveyed
all
this
with
her
imperturbable
placidity
.
*NL*
Within
the
last
five
or
six
months
she
had
experienced
a
certain
amount
*NL*
of
emotions
.
Marius
returned
,
Marius
brought
back
bleeding
,
Marius
*NL*
brought
back
from
a
barricade
,
Marius
dead
,
then
living
,
Marius
*NL*
reconciled
,
Marius
betrothed
,
Marius
wedding
a
poor
girl
,
Marius
wedding
*NL*
a
millionairess
.
The
six
hundred
thousand
francs
had
been
her
last
*NL*
surprise
.
Then
,
her
indifference
of
a
girl
taking
her
first
communion
*NL*
returned
to
her
.
She
went
regularly
to
service
,
told
her
beads
,
read
her
*NL*
euchology
,
mumbled
Aves
in
one
corner
of
the
house
,
while
I
love
you
*NL*
was
being
whispered
in
the
other
,
and
she
beheld
Marius
and
Cosette
in
a
*NL*
vague
way
,
like
two
shadows
.
The
shadow
was
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
a
certain
state
of
inert
asceticism
in
which
the
soul
,
*NL*
neutralized
by
torpor
,
a
stranger
to
that
which
may
be
designated
as
the
*NL*
business
of
living
,
receives
no
impressions
,
either
human
,
or
pleasant
*NL*
or
painful
,
with
the
exception
of
earthquakes
and
catastrophes
.
This
*NL*
devotion
,
as
Father
Gillenormand
said
to
his
daughter
,
corresponds
to
*NL*
a
cold
in
the
head
.
You
smell
nothing
of
life
.
Neither
any
bad
,
nor
any
*NL*
good
odor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
had
settled
the
elderly
*NL*
spinster
's
indecision
.
Her
father
had
acquired
the
habit
of
taking
her
*NL*
so
little
into
account
,
that
he
had
not
consulted
her
in
the
matter
of
*NL*
consent
to
Marius
'
marriage
.
He
had
acted
impetuously
,
according
to
his
*NL*
wont
,
having
,
a
despot-turned
slave
,
but
a
single
thought
,
--
to
satisfy
*NL*
Marius
.
As
for
the
aunt
,
--
it
had
not
even
occurred
to
him
that
the
aunt
*NL*
existed
,
and
that
she
could
have
an
opinion
of
her
own
,
and
,
sheep
as
*NL*
she
was
,
this
had
vexed
her
.
Somewhat
resentful
in
her
inmost
soul
,
but
*NL*
impassive
externally
,
she
had
said
to
herself
:
``
My
father
has
settled
*NL*
the
question
of
the
marriage
without
reference
to
me
;
I
shall
settle
the
*NL*
question
of
the
inheritance
without
consulting
him
.
''
She
was
rich
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
and
her
father
was
not
.
She
had
reserved
her
decision
on
this
*NL*
point
.
It
is
probable
that
,
had
the
match
been
a
poor
one
,
she
would
*NL*
have
left
him
poor
.
``
So
much
the
worse
for
my
nephew
!
he
is
wedding
a
*NL*
beggar
,
let
him
be
a
beggar
himself
!
''
But
Cosette
's
half-million
pleased
*NL*
the
aunt
,
and
altered
her
inward
situation
so
far
as
this
pair
of
lovers
*NL*
were
concerned
.
One
owes
some
consideration
to
six
hundred
thousand
*NL*
francs
,
and
it
was
evident
that
she
could
not
do
otherwise
than
leave
*NL*
her
fortune
to
these
young
people
,
since
they
did
not
need
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
arranged
that
the
couple
should
live
with
the
grandfather
--
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
insisted
on
resigning
to
them
his
chamber
,
the
finest
in
*NL*
the
house
.
``
That
will
make
me
young
again
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
's
an
old
plan
*NL*
of
mine
.
I
have
always
entertained
the
idea
of
having
a
wedding
in
my
*NL*
chamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
furnished
this
chamber
with
a
multitude
of
elegant
trifles
.
He
had
*NL*
the
ceiling
and
walls
hung
with
an
extraordinary
stuff
,
which
he
had
by
*NL*
him
in
the
piece
,
and
which
he
believed
to
have
emanated
from
Utrecht
*NL*
with
a
buttercup-colored
satin
ground
,
covered
with
velvet
auricula
*NL*
blossoms
.
--
``
It
was
with
that
stuff
,
''
said
he
,
``
that
the
bed
of
the
*NL*
Duchesse
d'Anville
at
la
Roche-Guyon
was
draped
.
''
--
On
the
chimney-piece
,
*NL*
he
set
a
little
figure
in
Saxe
porcelain
,
carrying
a
muff
against
her
*NL*
nude
stomach
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
's
library
became
the
lawyer
's
study
,
which
Marius
*NL*
needed
;
a
study
,
it
will
be
remembered
,
being
required
by
the
council
of
*NL*
the
order
.

CHAPTER
VII
--
THE
EFFECTS
OF
DREAMS
MINGLED
WITH
HAPPINESS
*NL*
*NL*
The
lovers
saw
each
other
every
day
.
Cosette
came
with
M.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
.
--
``
This
is
reversing
things
,
''
said
Mademoiselle
*NL*
Gillenormand
,
``
to
have
the
bride
come
to
the
house
to
do
the
courting
*NL*
like
this
.
''
But
Marius
'
convalescence
had
caused
the
habit
to
become
*NL*
established
,
and
the
arm-chairs
of
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
*NL*
better
adapted
to
interviews
than
the
straw
chairs
of
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
*NL*
Arme
,
had
rooted
it
.
Marius
and
M.
Fauchelevent
saw
each
other
,
but
did
*NL*
not
address
each
other
.
It
seemed
as
though
this
had
been
agreed
upon
.
*NL*
Every
girl
needs
a
chaperon
.
Cosette
could
not
have
come
without
*NL*
M.
Fauchelevent
.
In
Marius
'
eyes
,
M.
Fauchelevent
was
the
condition
*NL*
attached
to
Cosette
.
He
accepted
it
.
By
dint
of
discussing
political
*NL*
matters
,
vaguely
and
without
precision
,
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
*NL*
general
amelioration
of
the
fate
of
all
men
,
they
came
to
say
a
little
*NL*
more
than
``
yes
''
and
``
no
.
''
Once
,
on
the
subject
of
education
,
which
*NL*
Marius
wished
to
have
free
and
obligatory
,
multiplied
under
all
forms
*NL*
lavished
on
every
one
,
like
the
air
and
the
sun
in
a
word
,
respirable
*NL*
for
the
entire
population
,
they
were
in
unison
,
and
they
almost
*NL*
conversed
.
M.
Fauchelevent
talked
well
,
and
even
with
a
certain
*NL*
loftiness
of
language
--
still
he
lacked
something
indescribable
.
M.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
possessed
something
less
and
also
something
more
,
than
a
*NL*
man
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
inwardly
,
and
in
the
depths
of
his
thought
,
surrounded
with
*NL*
all
sorts
of
mute
questions
this
M.
Fauchelevent
,
who
was
to
him
simply
*NL*
benevolent
and
cold
.
There
were
moments
when
doubts
as
to
his
own
*NL*
recollections
occurred
to
him
.
There
was
a
void
in
his
memory
,
a
black
*NL*
spot
,
an
abyss
excavated
by
four
months
of
agony
.
--
Many
things
had
been
*NL*
lost
therein
.
He
had
come
to
the
point
of
asking
himself
whether
it
were
*NL*
really
a
fact
that
he
had
seen
M.
Fauchelevent
,
so
serious
and
so
calm
a
*NL*
man
,
in
the
barricade
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
,
however
,
the
only
stupor
which
the
apparitions
and
the
*NL*
disappearances
of
the
past
had
left
in
his
mind
.
It
must
not
be
supposed
*NL*
that
he
was
delivered
from
all
those
obsessions
of
the
memory
which
*NL*
force
us
,
even
when
happy
,
even
when
satisfied
,
to
glance
sadly
behind
*NL*
us
.
The
head
which
does
not
turn
backwards
towards
horizons
that
have
*NL*
vanished
contains
neither
thought
nor
love
.
At
times
,
Marius
clasped
his
*NL*
face
between
his
hands
,
and
the
vague
and
tumultuous
past
traversed
the
*NL*
twilight
which
reigned
in
his
brain
.
Again
he
beheld
Mabeuf
fall
,
he
*NL*
heard
Gavroche
singing
amid
the
grape-shot
,
he
felt
beneath
his
lips
the
*NL*
cold
brow
of
Eponine
;
Enjolras
,
Courfeyrac
,
Jean
Prouvaire
,
Combeferre
,
*NL*
Bossuet
,
Grantaire
,
all
his
friends
rose
erect
before
him
,
then
*NL*
dispersed
into
thin
air
.
Were
all
those
dear
,
sorrowful
,
valiant
,
*NL*
charming
or
tragic
beings
merely
dreams
?
had
they
actually
existed
?
The
*NL*
revolt
had
enveloped
everything
in
its
smoke
.
These
great
fevers
create
*NL*
great
dreams
.
He
questioned
himself
;
he
felt
himself
;
all
these
vanished
*NL*
realities
made
him
dizzy
.
Where
were
they
all
then
?
was
it
really
true
*NL*
that
all
were
dead
?
A
fall
into
the
shadows
had
carried
off
all
except
*NL*
himself
.
It
all
seemed
to
him
to
have
disappeared
as
though
behind
the
*NL*
curtain
of
a
theatre
.
There
are
curtains
like
this
which
drop
in
life
.
*NL*
God
passes
on
to
the
following
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
himself
--
was
he
actually
the
same
man
?
He
,
the
poor
man
,
was
*NL*
rich
;
he
,
the
abandoned
,
had
a
family
;
he
,
the
despairing
,
was
to
marry
*NL*
Cosette
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
traversed
a
tomb
,
and
that
he
had
*NL*
entered
into
it
black
and
had
emerged
from
it
white
,
and
in
that
tomb
*NL*
the
others
had
remained
.
At
certain
moments
,
all
these
beings
of
the
*NL*
past
,
returned
and
present
,
formed
a
circle
around
him
,
and
overshadowed
*NL*
him
;
then
he
thought
of
Cosette
,
and
recovered
his
serenity
;
but
nothing
*NL*
less
than
this
felicity
could
have
sufficed
to
efface
that
catastrophe
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Fauchelevent
almost
occupied
a
place
among
these
vanished
beings
.
*NL*
Marius
hesitated
to
believe
that
the
Fauchelevent
of
the
barricade
was
*NL*
the
same
as
this
Fauchelevent
in
flesh
and
blood
,
sitting
so
gravely
*NL*
beside
Cosette
.
The
first
was
,
probably
,
one
of
those
nightmares
*NL*
occasioned
and
brought
back
by
his
hours
of
delirium
.
However
,
*NL*
the
natures
of
both
men
were
rigid
,
no
question
from
Marius
to
M.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
was
possible
.
Such
an
idea
had
not
even
occurred
to
him
.
We
*NL*
have
already
indicated
this
characteristic
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
men
who
have
a
secret
in
common
,
and
who
,
by
a
sort
of
tacit
*NL*
agreement
,
exchange
not
a
word
on
the
subject
,
are
less
rare
than
is
*NL*
commonly
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
only
,
did
Marius
make
the
attempt
.
He
introduced
into
the
*NL*
conversation
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
and
,
turning
to
M.
Fauchelevent
,
*NL*
he
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
you
are
acquainted
with
that
street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
idea
of
the
name
of
that
street
,
''
replied
M.
Fauchelevent
,
in
*NL*
the
most
natural
manner
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
response
which
bore
upon
the
name
of
the
street
and
not
upon
the
*NL*
street
itself
,
appeared
to
Marius
to
be
more
conclusive
than
it
really
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
,
''
thought
he
,
``
I
have
been
dreaming
.
I
have
been
subject
to
*NL*
a
hallucination
.
It
was
some
one
who
resembled
him
.
M.
Fauchelevent
was
*NL*
not
there
.

CHAPTER
VIII
--
TWO
MEN
IMPOSSIBLE
TO
FIND
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
enchantment
,
great
as
it
was
,
could
not
efface
from
his
mind
*NL*
other
pre-occupations
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
wedding
was
in
preparation
,
and
while
awaiting
the
date
fixed
*NL*
upon
,
he
caused
difficult
and
scrupulous
retrospective
researches
to
be
*NL*
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
owed
gratitude
in
various
quarters
;
he
owed
it
on
his
father
's
*NL*
account
,
he
owed
it
on
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
Thenardier
;
there
was
the
unknown
man
who
had
brought
him
,
*NL*
Marius
,
back
to
M.
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
endeavored
to
find
these
two
men
,
not
intending
to
marry
,
to
*NL*
be
happy
,
and
to
forget
them
,
and
fearing
that
,
were
these
debts
of
*NL*
gratitude
not
discharged
,
they
would
leave
a
shadow
on
his
life
,
which
*NL*
promised
so
brightly
for
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
him
to
leave
all
these
arrears
of
suffering
behind
*NL*
him
,
and
he
wished
,
before
entering
joyously
into
the
future
,
to
obtain
*NL*
a
quittance
from
the
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Thenardier
was
a
villain
detracted
nothing
from
the
fact
that
he
*NL*
had
saved
Colonel
Pontmercy
.
Thenardier
was
a
ruffian
in
the
eyes
of
all
*NL*
the
world
except
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Marius
,
ignorant
of
the
real
scene
in
the
battle
field
of
Waterloo
,
*NL*
was
not
aware
of
the
peculiar
detail
,
that
his
father
,
so
far
as
*NL*
Thenardier
was
concerned
was
in
the
strange
position
of
being
indebted
*NL*
to
the
latter
for
his
life
,
without
being
indebted
to
him
for
any
*NL*
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
various
agents
whom
Marius
employed
succeeded
in
discovering
*NL*
any
trace
of
Thenardier
.
Obliteration
appeared
to
be
complete
in
*NL*
that
quarter
.
Madame
Thenardier
had
died
in
prison
pending
the
trial
.
*NL*
Thenardier
and
his
daughter
Azelma
,
the
only
two
remaining
of
that
*NL*
lamentable
group
,
had
plunged
back
into
the
gloom
.
The
gulf
of
the
*NL*
social
unknown
had
silently
closed
above
those
beings
.
On
the
surface
*NL*
there
was
not
visible
so
much
as
that
quiver
,
that
trembling
,
those
*NL*
obscure
concentric
circles
which
announce
that
something
has
fallen
in
,
*NL*
and
that
the
plummet
may
be
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madame
Thenardier
being
dead
,
Boulatruelle
being
eliminated
from
the
*NL*
case
,
Claquesous
having
disappeared
,
the
principal
persons
accused
*NL*
having
escaped
from
prison
,
the
trial
connected
with
the
ambush
in
the
*NL*
Gorbeau
house
had
come
to
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
affair
had
remained
rather
obscure
.
The
bench
of
Assizes
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
content
themselves
with
two
subordinates
.
Panchaud
,
alias
*NL*
Printanier
,
alias
Bigrenaille
,
and
Demi-Liard
,
alias
Deux-Milliards
,
who
*NL*
had
been
inconsistently
condemned
,
after
a
hearing
of
both
sides
of
*NL*
the
case
,
to
ten
years
in
the
galleys
.
Hard
labor
for
life
had
been
the
*NL*
sentence
pronounced
against
the
escaped
and
contumacious
accomplices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
the
head
and
leader
,
had
been
,
through
contumacy
,
likewise
*NL*
condemned
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
sentence
was
the
only
information
remaining
about
Thenardier
,
*NL*
casting
upon
that
buried
name
its
sinister
light
like
a
candle
beside
a
*NL*
bier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
by
thrusting
Thenardier
back
into
the
very
remotest
depths
,
*NL*
through
a
fear
of
being
re-captured
,
this
sentence
added
to
the
density
*NL*
of
the
shadows
which
enveloped
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
other
person
,
as
for
the
unknown
man
who
had
saved
Marius
,
*NL*
the
researches
were
at
first
to
some
extent
successful
,
then
came
to
*NL*
an
abrupt
conclusion
.
They
succeeded
in
finding
the
carriage
which
had
*NL*
brought
Marius
to
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
on
the
evening
of
the
*NL*
6th
of
June
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
declared
that
,
on
the
6th
of
June
,
in
obedience
to
the
*NL*
commands
of
a
police-agent
,
he
had
stood
from
three
o'clock
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
until
nightfall
on
the
Quai
des
Champs-Elysees
,
above
the
*NL*
outlet
of
the
Grand
Sewer
;
that
,
towards
nine
o'clock
in
the
evening
,
*NL*
the
grating
of
the
sewer
,
which
abuts
on
the
bank
of
the
river
,
had
*NL*
opened
;
that
a
man
had
emerged
therefrom
,
bearing
on
his
shoulders
*NL*
another
man
,
who
seemed
to
be
dead
;
that
the
agent
,
who
was
on
the
watch
*NL*
at
that
point
,
had
arrested
the
living
man
and
had
seized
the
dead
man
;
*NL*
that
,
at
the
order
of
the
police-agent
,
he
,
the
coachman
,
had
taken
``
all
*NL*
those
folks
''
into
his
carriage
;
that
they
had
first
driven
to
the
Rue
*NL*
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
;
that
they
had
there
deposited
the
dead
man
;
that
*NL*
the
dead
man
was
Monsieur
Marius
,
and
that
he
,
the
coachman
,
recognized
*NL*
him
perfectly
,
although
he
was
alive
``
this
time
''
;
that
afterwards
,
they
*NL*
had
entered
the
vehicle
again
,
that
he
had
whipped
up
his
horses
;
a
few
*NL*
paces
from
the
gate
of
the
Archives
,
they
had
called
to
him
to
halt
;
*NL*
that
there
,
in
the
street
,
they
had
paid
him
and
left
him
,
and
that
the
*NL*
police-agent
had
led
the
other
man
away
;
that
he
knew
nothing
more
;
that
*NL*
the
night
had
been
very
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
as
we
have
said
,
recalled
nothing
.
He
only
remembered
that
he
*NL*
had
been
seized
from
behind
by
an
energetic
hand
at
the
moment
when
he
*NL*
was
falling
backwards
into
the
barricade
;
then
,
everything
vanished
so
*NL*
far
as
he
was
concerned
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
only
regained
consciousness
at
M.
Gillenormand
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
lost
in
conjectures
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
doubt
his
own
identity
.
Still
,
how
had
it
come
to
pass
*NL*
that
,
having
fallen
in
the
Rue
de
la
Chanvrerie
,
he
had
been
picked
*NL*
up
by
the
police-agent
on
the
banks
of
the
Seine
,
near
the
Pont
des
*NL*
Invalides
?
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
had
carried
him
from
the
Quartier
des
Halles
to
the
*NL*
Champs-Elysees
.
And
how
?
Through
the
sewer
.
Unheard-of
devotion
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
?
Who
?
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
man
for
whom
Marius
was
searching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
this
man
,
who
was
his
savior
,
nothing
;
not
a
trace
;
not
the
faintest
*NL*
indication
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
although
forced
to
preserve
great
reserve
,
in
that
direction
,
*NL*
pushed
his
inquiries
as
far
as
the
prefecture
of
police
.
There
,
no
more
*NL*
than
elsewhere
,
did
the
information
obtained
lead
to
any
enlightenment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prefecture
knew
less
about
the
matter
than
did
the
hackney-coachman
.
*NL*
They
had
no
knowledge
of
any
arrest
having
been
made
on
the
6th
of
June
*NL*
at
the
mouth
of
the
Grand
Sewer
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
report
of
any
agent
had
been
received
there
upon
this
matter
,
which
*NL*
was
regarded
at
the
prefecture
as
a
fable
.
The
invention
of
this
fable
*NL*
was
attributed
to
the
coachman
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
coachman
who
wants
a
gratuity
is
capable
of
anything
,
even
of
*NL*
imagination
.
The
fact
was
assured
,
nevertheless
,
and
Marius
could
not
*NL*
doubt
it
,
unless
he
doubted
his
own
identity
,
as
we
have
just
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
about
this
singular
enigma
was
inexplicable
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
become
of
that
man
,
that
mysterious
man
,
whom
the
coachman
had
*NL*
seen
emerge
from
the
grating
of
the
Grand
Sewer
bearing
upon
his
back
*NL*
the
unconscious
Marius
,
and
whom
the
police-agent
on
the
watch
had
*NL*
arrested
in
the
very
act
of
rescuing
an
insurgent
?
What
had
become
of
*NL*
the
agent
himself
?
*NL*
*NL*
Why
had
this
agent
preserved
silence
?
Had
the
man
succeeded
in
making
*NL*
his
escape
?
Had
he
bribed
the
agent
?
Why
did
this
man
give
no
sign
of
*NL*
life
to
Marius
,
who
owed
everything
to
him
?
His
disinterestedness
was
no
*NL*
less
tremendous
than
his
devotion
.
Why
had
not
that
man
appeared
again
?
*NL*
Perhaps
he
was
above
compensation
,
but
no
one
is
above
gratitude
.
Was
he
*NL*
dead
?
Who
was
the
man
?
What
sort
of
a
face
had
he
?
No
one
could
tell
him
*NL*
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
answered
:
``
The
night
was
very
dark
.
''
Basque
and
Nicolette
,
*NL*
all
in
a
flutter
,
had
looked
only
at
their
young
master
all
covered
with
*NL*
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
,
whose
candle
had
lighted
the
tragic
arrival
of
Marius
,
had
*NL*
been
the
only
one
to
take
note
of
the
man
in
question
,
and
this
is
the
*NL*
description
that
he
gave
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
man
was
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
the
blood-stained
clothing
which
he
had
worn
when
he
had
been
*NL*
brought
back
to
his
grandfather
preserved
,
in
the
hope
that
it
would
*NL*
prove
of
service
in
his
researches
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
examining
the
coat
,
it
was
found
that
one
skirt
had
been
torn
in
a
*NL*
singular
way
.
A
piece
was
missing
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
,
Marius
was
speaking
in
the
presence
of
Cosette
and
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
of
the
whole
of
that
singular
adventure
,
of
the
innumerable
*NL*
inquiries
which
he
had
made
,
and
of
the
fruitlessness
of
his
efforts
.
*NL*
The
cold
countenance
of
``
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
''
angered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
exclaimed
,
with
a
vivacity
which
had
something
of
wrath
in
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
man
,
whoever
he
may
have
been
,
was
sublime
.
Do
you
know
what
*NL*
he
did
,
sir
?
He
intervened
like
an
archangel
.
He
must
have
flung
himself
*NL*
into
the
midst
of
the
battle
,
have
stolen
me
away
,
have
opened
the
*NL*
sewer
,
have
dragged
me
into
it
and
have
carried
me
through
it
!
He
*NL*
must
have
traversed
more
than
a
league
and
a
half
in
those
frightful
*NL*
subterranean
galleries
,
bent
over
,
weighed
down
,
in
the
dark
,
in
the
*NL*
cess-pool
,
--
more
than
a
league
and
a
half
,
sir
,
with
a
corpse
upon
his
*NL*
back
!
And
with
what
object
?
With
the
sole
object
of
saving
the
corpse
.
*NL*
And
that
corpse
I
was
.
He
said
to
himself
:
`
There
may
still
be
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
life
there
,
perchance
;
I
will
risk
my
own
existence
for
that
*NL*
miserable
spark
!
'
And
his
existence
he
risked
not
once
but
twenty
times
!
*NL*
And
every
step
was
a
danger
.
The
proof
of
it
is
,
that
on
emerging
from
*NL*
the
sewer
,
he
was
arrested
.
Do
you
know
,
sir
,
that
that
man
did
all
*NL*
this
?
And
he
had
no
recompense
to
expect
.
What
was
I
?
An
insurgent
.
*NL*
What
was
I
?
One
of
the
conquered
.
Oh
!
if
Cosette
's
six
hundred
thousand
*NL*
francs
were
mine
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
yours
,
''
interrupted
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
resumed
Marius
,
``
I
would
give
them
all
to
find
that
man
once
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean

remained
silent

CHAPTER

THE
16TH
OF
FEBRUARY
,
1833
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
of
the
16th
to
the
17th
of
February
,
1833
,
was
a
blessed
*NL*
night
.
Above
its
shadows
heaven
stood
open
.
It
was
the
wedding
night
of
*NL*
Marius
and
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
had
been
adorable
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
not
been
the
grand
festival
dreamed
by
the
grandfather
,
a
fairy
*NL*
spectacle
,
with
a
confusion
of
cherubim
and
Cupids
over
the
heads
of
the
*NL*
bridal
pair
,
a
marriage
worthy
to
form
the
subject
of
a
painting
to
be
*NL*
placed
over
a
door
;
but
it
had
been
sweet
and
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manner
of
marriage
in
1833
was
not
the
same
as
it
is
to-day
.
France
*NL*
had
not
yet
borrowed
from
England
that
supreme
delicacy
of
carrying
off
*NL*
one
's
wife
,
of
fleeing
,
on
coming
out
of
church
,
of
hiding
oneself
with
*NL*
shame
from
one
's
happiness
,
and
of
combining
the
ways
of
a
bankrupt
with
*NL*
the
delights
of
the
Song
of
Songs
.
People
had
not
yet
grasped
to
the
*NL*
full
the
chastity
,
exquisiteness
,
and
decency
of
jolting
their
paradise
*NL*
in
a
posting-chaise
,
of
breaking
up
their
mystery
with
clic-clacs
,
of
*NL*
taking
for
a
nuptial
bed
the
bed
of
an
inn
,
and
of
leaving
behind
them
,
*NL*
in
a
commonplace
chamber
,
at
such
a
night
,
the
most
sacred
of
*NL*
the
souvenirs
of
life
mingled
pell-mell
with
the
tete-a-tete
of
the
*NL*
conductor
of
the
diligence
and
the
maid-servant
of
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
second
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
in
which
we
are
now
*NL*
living
,
the
mayor
and
his
scarf
,
the
priest
and
his
chasuble
,
the
law
*NL*
and
God
no
longer
suffice
;
they
must
be
eked
out
by
the
Postilion
de
*NL*
Lonjumeau
;
a
blue
waistcoat
turned
up
with
red
,
and
with
bell
buttons
,
*NL*
a
plaque
like
a
vantbrace
,
knee-breeches
of
green
leather
,
oaths
to
the
*NL*
Norman
horses
with
their
tails
knotted
up
,
false
galloons
,
varnished
*NL*
hat
,
long
powdered
locks
,
an
enormous
whip
and
tall
boots
.
France
does
*NL*
not
yet
carry
elegance
to
the
length
of
doing
like
the
English
nobility
,
*NL*
and
raining
down
on
the
post-chaise
of
the
bridal
pair
a
hail
storm
*NL*
of
slippers
trodden
down
at
heel
and
of
worn-out
shoes
,
in
memory
of
*NL*
Churchill
,
afterwards
Marlborough
,
or
Malbrouck
,
who
was
assailed
on
*NL*
his
wedding-day
by
the
wrath
of
an
aunt
which
brought
him
good
luck
.
*NL*
Old
shoes
and
slippers
do
not
,
as
yet
,
form
a
part
of
our
nuptial
*NL*
celebrations
;
but
patience
,
as
good
taste
continues
to
spread
,
we
shall
*NL*
come
to
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1833
,
a
hundred
years
ago
,
marriage
was
not
conducted
at
a
full
trot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
say
,
at
that
epoch
,
people
still
imagined
that
a
wedding
was
*NL*
a
private
and
social
festival
,
that
a
patriarchal
banquet
does
not
*NL*
spoil
a
domestic
solemnity
,
that
gayety
,
even
in
excess
,
provided
it
be
*NL*
honest
,
and
decent
,
does
happiness
no
harm
,
and
that
,
in
short
,
it
is
a
*NL*
good
and
a
venerable
thing
that
the
fusion
of
these
two
destinies
whence
*NL*
a
family
is
destined
to
spring
,
should
begin
at
home
,
and
that
the
*NL*
household
should
thenceforth
have
its
nuptial
chamber
as
its
witness
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
people
were
so
immodest
as
to
marry
in
their
own
homes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
marriage
took
place
,
therefore
,
in
accordance
with
this
now
*NL*
superannuated
fashion
,
at
M.
Gillenormand
's
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Natural
and
commonplace
as
this
matter
of
marrying
is
,
the
banns
to
*NL*
publish
,
the
papers
to
be
drawn
up
,
the
mayoralty
,
and
the
church
*NL*
produce
some
complication
.
They
could
not
get
ready
before
the
16th
of
*NL*
February
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
we
note
this
detail
,
for
the
pure
satisfaction
of
being
exact
,
it
*NL*
chanced
that
the
16th
fell
on
Shrove
Tuesday
.
Hesitations
,
scruples
,
*NL*
particularly
on
the
part
of
Aunt
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shrove
Tuesday
!
''
exclaimed
the
grandfather
,
``
so
much
the
better
.
There
*NL*
is
a
proverb
:
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
Let
us
proceed
.
Here
goes
for
the
16th
!
Do
you
want
to
delay
,
Marius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
certainly
not
!
''
replied
the
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
marry
,
then
,
''
cried
the
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Accordingly
,
the
marriage
took
place
on
the
16th
,
notwithstanding
the
*NL*
public
merrymaking
.
It
rained
that
day
,
but
there
is
always
in
the
sky
*NL*
a
tiny
scrap
of
blue
at
the
service
of
happiness
,
which
lovers
see
,
even
*NL*
when
the
rest
of
creation
is
under
an
umbrella
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
preceding
evening
,
Jean
Valjean
handed
to
Marius
,
in
the
presence
*NL*
of
M.
Gillenormand
,
the
five
hundred
and
eighty-four
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
marriage
was
taking
place
under
the
regime
of
community
of
*NL*
property
,
the
papers
had
been
simple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
,
Toussaint
was
of
no
use
to
Jean
Valjean
;
Cosette
inherited
*NL*
her
and
promoted
her
to
the
rank
of
lady
's
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Jean
Valjean
,
a
beautiful
chamber
in
the
Gillenormand
house
had
*NL*
been
furnished
expressly
for
him
,
and
Cosette
had
said
to
him
in
such
*NL*
an
irresistible
manner
:
``
Father
,
I
entreat
you
,
''
that
she
had
almost
*NL*
persuaded
him
to
promise
that
he
would
come
and
occupy
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
before
that
fixed
on
for
the
marriage
,
an
accident
happened
*NL*
to
Jean
Valjean
;
he
crushed
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
.
This
was
not
a
*NL*
serious
matter
;
and
he
had
not
allowed
any
one
to
trouble
himself
*NL*
about
it
,
nor
to
dress
it
,
nor
even
to
see
his
hurt
,
not
even
Cosette
.
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
this
had
forced
him
to
swathe
his
hand
in
a
linen
bandage
,
*NL*
and
to
carry
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
and
had
prevented
his
signing
.
M.
*NL*
Gillenormand
,
in
his
capacity
of
Cosette
's
supervising-guardian
,
had
*NL*
supplied
his
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
will
not
conduct
the
reader
either
to
the
mayor
's
office
or
to
the
*NL*
church
.
One
does
not
follow
a
pair
of
lovers
to
that
extent
,
and
one
is
*NL*
accustomed
to
turn
one
's
back
on
the
drama
as
soon
as
it
puts
a
wedding
*NL*
nosegay
in
its
buttonhole
.
We
will
confine
ourselves
to
noting
an
*NL*
incident
which
,
though
unnoticed
by
the
wedding
party
,
marked
the
*NL*
transit
from
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
to
the
church
of
Saint-Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
epoch
,
the
northern
extremity
of
the
Rue
Saint-Louis
was
in
*NL*
process
of
repaving
.
It
was
barred
off
,
beginning
with
the
Rue
du
*NL*
Pare-Royal
.
It
was
impossible
for
the
wedding
carriages
to
go
directly
*NL*
to
Saint-Paul
.
They
were
obliged
to
alter
their
course
,
and
the
simplest
*NL*
way
was
to
turn
through
the
boulevard
.
One
of
the
invited
guests
*NL*
observed
that
it
was
Shrove
Tuesday
,
and
that
there
would
be
a
jam
*NL*
of
vehicles
.

Why

asked
M.
Gillenormand
--
``
Because
of
the
*NL*
maskers
.
''
--
``
Capital
,
''
said
the
grandfather
,
``
let
us
go
that
way
.
These
*NL*
young
folks
are
on
the
way
to
be
married
;
they
are
about
to
enter
the
*NL*
serious
part
of
life
.
This
will
prepare
them
for
seeing
a
bit
of
the
*NL*
masquerade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
by
way
of
the
boulevard
.
The
first
wedding
coach
held
Cosette
*NL*
and
Aunt
Gillenormand
,
M.
Gillenormand
and
Jean
Valjean
.
Marius
,
still
*NL*
separated
from
his
betrothed
according
to
usage
,
did
not
come
until
*NL*
the
second
.
The
nuptial
train
,
on
emerging
from
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
became
entangled
in
a
long
procession
of
vehicles
*NL*
which
formed
an
endless
chain
from
the
Madeleine
to
the
Bastille
,
and
*NL*
from
the
Bastille
to
the
Madeleine
.
Maskers
abounded
on
the
boulevard
.
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
raining
at
intervals
,
Merry-Andrew
,
*NL*
Pantaloon
and
Clown
persisted
.
In
the
good
humor
of
that
winter
of
1833
,
*NL*
Paris
had
disguised
itself
as
Venice
.
Such
Shrove
Tuesdays
are
no
*NL*
longer
to
be
seen
now-a-days
.
Everything
which
exists
being
a
scattered
*NL*
Carnival
,
there
is
no
longer
any
Carnival
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sidewalks
were
overflowing
with
pedestrians
and
the
windows
with
*NL*
curious
spectators
.
The
terraces
which
crown
the
peristyles
of
the
*NL*
theatres
were
bordered
with
spectators
.
Besides
the
maskers
,
they
stared
*NL*
at
that
procession
--
peculiar
to
Shrove
Tuesday
as
to
Longchamps
,
--
of
*NL*
vehicles
of
every
description
,
citadines
,
tapissieres
,
carioles
,
*NL*
cabriolets
marching
in
order
,
rigorously
riveted
to
each
other
by
the
*NL*
police
regulations
,
and
locked
into
rails
,
as
it
were
.
Any
one
in
*NL*
these
vehicles
is
at
once
a
spectator
and
a
spectacle
.
Police-sergeants
*NL*
maintained
,
on
the
sides
of
the
boulevard
,
these
two
interminable
*NL*
parallel
files
,
moving
in
contrary
directions
,
and
saw
to
it
that
*NL*
nothing
interfered
with
that
double
current
,
those
two
brooks
of
*NL*
carriages
,
flowing
,
the
one
down
stream
,
the
other
up
stream
,
the
*NL*
one
towards
the
Chaussee
d'Antin
,
the
other
towards
the
Faubourg
*NL*
Saint-Antoine
.
The
carriages
of
the
peers
of
France
and
of
the
*NL*
Ambassadors
,
emblazoned
with
coats
of
arms
,
held
the
middle
of
the
way
,
*NL*
going
and
coming
freely
.
Certain
joyous
and
magnificent
trains
,
notably
*NL*
that
of
the
Boeuf
Gras
,
had
the
same
privilege
.
In
this
gayety
of
Paris
,
*NL*
England
cracked
her
whip
;
Lord
Seymour
's
post-chaise
,
harassed
by
a
*NL*
nickname
from
the
populace
,
passed
with
great
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
double
file
,
along
which
the
municipal
guards
galloped
like
*NL*
sheep-dogs
,
honest
family
coaches
,
loaded
down
with
great-aunts
and
*NL*
grandmothers
,
displayed
at
their
doors
fresh
groups
of
children
in
*NL*
disguise
,
Clowns
of
seven
years
of
age
,
Columbines
of
six
,
ravishing
*NL*
little
creatures
,
who
felt
that
they
formed
an
official
part
of
the
*NL*
public
mirth
,
who
were
imbued
with
the
dignity
of
their
harlequinade
,
*NL*
and
who
possessed
the
gravity
of
functionaries
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
time
to
time
,
a
hitch
arose
somewhere
in
the
procession
of
*NL*
vehicles
;
one
or
other
of
the
two
lateral
files
halted
until
the
knot
*NL*
was
disentangled
;
one
carriage
delayed
sufficed
to
paralyze
the
whole
*NL*
line
.
Then
they
set
out
again
on
the
march
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wedding
carriages
were
in
the
file
proceeding
towards
the
Bastille
,
*NL*
and
skirting
the
right
side
of
the
Boulevard
.
At
the
top
of
the
*NL*
Pont-aux-Choux
,
there
was
a
stoppage
.
Nearly
at
the
same
moment
,
the
*NL*
other
file
,
which
was
proceeding
towards
the
Madeleine
,
halted
also
.
At
*NL*
that
point
of
the
file
there
was
a
carriage-load
of
maskers
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
carriages
,
or
to
speak
more
correctly
,
these
wagon-loads
of
*NL*
maskers
are
very
familiar
to
Parisians
.
If
they
were
missing
on
a
Shrove
*NL*
Tuesday
,
or
at
the
Mid-Lent
,
it
would
be
taken
in
bad
part
,
and
people
*NL*
would
say
:
``
There
's
something
behind
that
.
Probably
the
ministry
*NL*
is
about
to
undergo
a
change
.
''
A
pile
of
Cassandras
,
Harlequins
and
*NL*
Columbines
,
jolted
along
high
above
the
passers-by
,
all
possible
*NL*
grotesquenesses
,
from
the
Turk
to
the
savage
,
Hercules
supporting
*NL*
Marquises
,
fishwives
who
would
have
made
Rabelais
stop
up
his
ears
just
*NL*
as
the
Maenads
made
Aristophanes
drop
his
eyes
,
tow
wigs
,
pink
tights
,
*NL*
dandified
hats
,
spectacles
of
a
grimacer
,
three-cornered
hats
of
Janot
*NL*
tormented
with
a
butterfly
,
shouts
directed
at
pedestrians
,
fists
on
*NL*
hips
,
bold
attitudes
,
bare
shoulders
,
immodesty
unchained
;
a
chaos
of
*NL*
shamelessness
driven
by
a
coachman
crowned
with
flowers
;
this
is
what
*NL*
that
institution
was
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
Greece
stood
in
need
of
the
chariot
of
Thespis
,
France
stands
in
need
of
*NL*
the
hackney-coach
of
Vade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
can
be
parodied
,
even
parody
.
The
Saturnalia
,
that
grimace
of
*NL*
antique
beauty
,
ends
,
through
exaggeration
after
exaggeration
,
in
Shrove
*NL*
Tuesday
;
and
the
Bacchanal
,
formerly
crowned
with
sprays
of
vine
leaves
*NL*
and
grapes
,
inundated
with
sunshine
,
displaying
her
marble
breast
in
a
*NL*
divine
semi-nudity
,
having
at
the
present
day
lost
her
shape
under
*NL*
the
soaked
rags
of
the
North
,
has
finally
come
to
be
called
the
*NL*
Jack-pudding
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tradition
of
carriage-loads
of
maskers
runs
back
to
the
most
ancient
*NL*
days
of
the
monarchy
.
The
accounts
of
Louis
XI
.
allot
to
the
bailiff
of
*NL*
the
palace
``
twenty
sous
,
Tournois
,
for
three
coaches
of
mascarades
*NL*
in
the
cross-roads
.
''
In
our
day
,
these
noisy
heaps
of
creatures
are
*NL*
accustomed
to
have
themselves
driven
in
some
ancient
cuckoo
carriage
,
*NL*
whose
imperial
they
load
down
,
or
they
overwhelm
a
hired
landau
,
with
*NL*
its
top
thrown
back
,
with
their
tumultuous
groups
.
Twenty
of
them
ride
*NL*
in
a
carriage
intended
for
six
.
They
cling
to
the
seats
,
to
the
rumble
,
*NL*
on
the
cheeks
of
the
hood
,
on
the
shafts
.
They
even
bestride
the
*NL*
carriage
lamps
.
They
stand
,
sit
,
lie
,
with
their
knees
drawn
up
in
a
*NL*
knot
,
and
their
legs
hanging
.
The
women
sit
on
the
men
's
laps
.
Far
*NL*
away
,
above
the
throng
of
heads
,
their
wild
pyramid
is
visible
.
These
*NL*
carriage-loads
form
mountains
of
mirth
in
the
midst
of
the
rout
.
Colle
,
*NL*
Panard
and
Piron
flow
from
it
,
enriched
with
slang
.
This
carriage
which
*NL*
has
become
colossal
through
its
freight
,
has
an
air
of
conquest
.
Uproar
*NL*
reigns
in
front
,
tumult
behind
.
People
vociferate
,
shout
,
howl
,
there
*NL*
they
break
forth
and
writhe
with
enjoyment
;
gayety
roars
;
sarcasm
flames
*NL*
forth
,
joviality
is
flaunted
like
a
red
flag
;
two
jades
there
drag
farce
*NL*
blossomed
forth
into
an
apotheosis
;
it
is
the
triumphal
car
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
laughter
that
is
too
cynical
to
be
frank
.
In
truth
,
this
laughter
is
*NL*
suspicious
.
This
laughter
has
a
mission
.
It
is
charged
with
proving
the
*NL*
Carnival
to
the
Parisians
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
fishwife
vehicles
,
in
which
one
feels
one
knows
not
what
shadows
,
*NL*
set
the
philosopher
to
thinking
.
There
is
government
therein
.
There
one
*NL*
lays
one
's
finger
on
a
mysterious
affinity
between
public
men
and
public
*NL*
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
certainly
is
sad
that
turpitude
heaped
up
should
give
a
sum
total
*NL*
of
gayety
,
that
by
piling
ignominy
upon
opprobrium
the
people
should
*NL*
be
enticed
,
that
the
system
of
spying
,
and
serving
as
caryatids
to
*NL*
prostitution
should
amuse
the
rabble
when
it
confronts
them
,
that
the
*NL*
crowd
loves
to
behold
that
monstrous
living
pile
of
tinsel
rags
,
half
*NL*
dung
,
half
light
,
roll
by
on
four
wheels
howling
and
laughing
,
that
they
*NL*
should
clap
their
hands
at
this
glory
composed
of
all
shames
,
that
there
*NL*
would
be
no
festival
for
the
populace
,
did
not
the
police
promenade
in
*NL*
their
midst
these
sorts
of
twenty-headed
hydras
of
joy
.
But
what
can
be
*NL*
done
about
it
?
These
be-ribboned
and
be-flowered
tumbrils
of
mire
are
*NL*
insulted
and
pardoned
by
the
laughter
of
the
public
.
The
laughter
of
all
*NL*
is
the
accomplice
of
universal
degradation
.
Certain
unhealthy
festivals
*NL*
disaggregate
the
people
and
convert
them
into
the
populace
.
And
*NL*
populaces
,
like
tyrants
,
require
buffoons
.
The
King
has
Roquelaure
,
*NL*
the
populace
has
the
Merry-Andrew
.
Paris
is
a
great
,
mad
city
on
every
*NL*
occasion
that
it
is
a
great
sublime
city
.
There
the
Carnival
forms
*NL*
part
of
politics
.
Paris
,
--
let
us
confess
it
--
willingly
allows
infamy
to
*NL*
furnish
it
with
comedy
.
She
only
demands
of
her
masters
--
when
she
has
*NL*
masters
--
one
thing
:
``
Paint
me
the
mud
.
''
Rome
was
of
the
same
mind
.
She
*NL*
loved
Nero
.
Nero
was
a
titanic
lighterman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chance
ordained
,
as
we
have
just
said
,
that
one
of
these
shapeless
*NL*
clusters
of
masked
men
and
women
,
dragged
about
on
a
vast
calash
,
should
*NL*
halt
on
the
left
of
the
boulevard
,
while
the
wedding
train
halted
on
the
*NL*
right
.
The
carriage-load
of
masks
caught
sight
of
the
wedding
carriage
*NL*
containing
the
bridal
party
opposite
them
on
the
other
side
of
the
*NL*
boulevard
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hullo
!
''
said
a
masker
,
``
here
's
a
wedding
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sham
wedding
,
''
retorted
another
.
``
We
are
the
genuine
article
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
being
too
far
off
to
accost
the
wedding
party
,
and
fearing
also
,
*NL*
the
rebuke
of
the
police
,
the
two
maskers
turned
their
eyes
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
another
minute
,
the
carriage-load
of
maskers
had
their
*NL*
hands
full
,
the
multitude
set
to
yelling
,
which
is
the
crowd
's
caress
*NL*
to
masquerades
;
and
the
two
maskers
who
had
just
spoken
had
to
face
the
*NL*
throng
with
their
comrades
,
and
did
not
find
the
entire
repertory
of
*NL*
projectiles
of
the
fishmarkets
too
extensive
to
retort
to
the
enormous
*NL*
verbal
attacks
of
the
populace
.
A
frightful
exchange
of
metaphors
took
*NL*
place
between
the
maskers
and
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meanwhile
,
two
other
maskers
in
the
same
carriage
,
a
Spaniard
*NL*
with
an
enormous
nose
,
an
elderly
air
,
and
huge
black
moustache
,
and
a
*NL*
gaunt
fishwife
,
who
was
quite
a
young
girl
,
masked
with
a
loup
,
-LSB-

had
*NL*
also
noticed
the
wedding
,
and
while
their
companions
and
the
passers-by
*NL*
were
exchanging
insults
,
they
had
held
a
dialogue
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
aside
was
covered
by
the
tumult
and
was
lost
in
it
.
The
gusts
of
*NL*
rain
had
drenched
the
front
of
the
vehicle
,
which
was
wide
open
;
the
*NL*
breezes
of
February
are
not
warm
;
as
the
fishwife
,
clad
in
a
low-necked
*NL*
gown
,
replied
to
the
Spaniard
,
she
shivered
,
laughed

coughed

CHAPTER
II
--
JEAN
VALJEAN
STILL
WEARS
HIS
ARM
IN
A
SLING
*NL*
*NL*
To
realize
one
's
dream
.
To
whom
is
this
accorded
?
There
must
be
*NL*
elections
for
this
in
heaven
;
we
are
all
candidates
,
unknown
to
*NL*
ourselves
;
the
angels
vote
.
Cosette
and
Marius
had
been
elected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
both
at
the
mayor
's
office
and
at
church
,
was
dazzling
and
*NL*
touching
.
Toussaint
,
assisted
by
Nicolette
,
had
dressed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
wore
over
a
petticoat
of
white
taffeta
,
her
robe
of
Binche
*NL*
guipure
,
a
veil
of
English
point
,
a
necklace
of
fine
pearls
,
a
wreath
*NL*
of
orange
flowers
;
all
this
was
white
,
and
,
from
the
midst
of
that
*NL*
whiteness
she
beamed
forth
.
It
was
an
exquisite
candor
expanding
and
*NL*
becoming
transfigured
in
the
light
.
One
would
have
pronounced
her
a
*NL*
virgin
on
the
point
of
turning
into
a
goddess
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
handsome
hair
was
lustrous
and
perfumed
;
here
and
there
,
beneath
*NL*
the
thick
curls
,
pale
lines
--
the
scars
of
the
barricade
--
were
visible
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandfather
,
haughty
,
with
head
held
high
,
amalgamating
more
than
*NL*
ever
in
his
toilet
and
his
manners
all
the
elegances
of
the
epoch
of
*NL*
Barras
,
escorted
Cosette
.
He
took
the
place
of
Jean
Valjean
,
who
,
on
*NL*
account
of
his
arm
being
still
in
a
sling
,
could
not
give
his
hand
to
*NL*
the
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
dressed
in
black
,
followed
them
with
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
,
''
said
the
grandfather
to
him
,
``
this
is
a
fine
*NL*
day
.
I
vote
for
the
end
of
afflictions
and
sorrows
.
Henceforth
,
there
*NL*
must
be
no
sadness
anywhere
.
Pardieu
,
I
decree
joy
!
Evil
has
no
right
to
*NL*
exist
.
That
there
should
be
any
unhappy
men
is
,
in
sooth
,
a
disgrace
*NL*
to
the
azure
of
the
sky
.
Evil
does
not
come
from
man
,
who
is
good
at
*NL*
bottom
.
All
human
miseries
have
for
their
capital
and
central
government
*NL*
hell
,
otherwise
,
known
as
the
Devil
's
Tuileries
.
Good
,
here
I
am
*NL*
uttering
demagogical
words
!
As
far
as
I
am
concerned
,
I
have
no
longer
*NL*
any
political
opinions
;
let
all
me
be
rich
,
that
is
to
say
,
mirthful
,
*NL*
and
I
confine
myself
to
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
at
the
conclusion
of
all
the
ceremonies
,
after
having
pronounced
*NL*
before
the
mayor
and
before
the
priest
all
possible
``
yesses
,
''
after
*NL*
having
signed
the
registers
at
the
municipality
and
at
the
sacristy
,
*NL*
after
having
exchanged
their
rings
,
after
having
knelt
side
by
side
*NL*
under
the
pall
of
white
moire
in
the
smoke
of
the
censer
,
they
arrived
,
*NL*
hand
in
hand
,
admired
and
envied
by
all
,
Marius
in
black
,
she
in
white
,
*NL*
preceded
by
the
suisse
,
with
the
epaulets
of
a
colonel
,
tapping
the
*NL*
pavement
with
his
halberd
,
between
two
rows
of
astonished
spectators
,
at
*NL*
the
portals
of
the
church
,
both
leaves
of
which
were
thrown
wide
open
,
*NL*
ready
to
enter
their
carriage
again
,
and
all
being
finished
,
Cosette
*NL*
still
could
not
believe
that
it
was
real
.
She
looked
at
Marius
,
she
*NL*
looked
at
the
crowd
,
she
looked
at
the
sky
:
it
seemed
as
though
she
*NL*
feared
that
she
should
wake
up
from
her
dream
.
Her
amazed
and
uneasy
air
*NL*
added
something
indescribably
enchanting
to
her
beauty
.
They
entered
the
*NL*
same
carriage
to
return
home
,
Marius
beside
Cosette
;
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
and
Jean
Valjean
sat
opposite
them
;
Aunt
Gillenormand
had
withdrawn
one
*NL*
degree
,
and
was
in
the
second
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
children
,
''
said
the
grandfather
,
``
here
you
are
,
Monsieur
le
Baron
*NL*
and
Madame
la
Baronne
,
with
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
livres
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Cosette
,
nestling
close
to
Marius
,
caressed
his
ear
with
an
angelic
*NL*
whisper
:
``
So
it
is
true
.
My
name
is
Marius
.
I
am
Madame
Thou
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
two
creatures
were
resplendent
.
They
had
reached
that
irrevocable
*NL*
and
irrecoverable
moment
,
at
the
dazzling
intersection
of
all
youth
and
*NL*
all
joy
.
They
realized
the
verses
of
Jean
Prouvaire
;
they
were
forty
*NL*
years
old
taken
together
.
It
was
marriage
sublimated
;
these
two
children
*NL*
were
two
lilies
.
They
did
not
see
each
other
,
they
did
not
contemplate
*NL*
each
other
.
Cosette
perceived
Marius
in
the
midst
of
a
glory
;
Marius
*NL*
perceived
Cosette
on
an
altar
.
And
on
that
altar
,
and
in
that
glory
,
the
*NL*
two
apotheoses
mingling
,
in
the
background
,
one
knows
not
how
,
behind
a
*NL*
cloud
for
Cosette
,
in
a
flash
for
Marius
,
there
was
the
ideal
thing
,
the
*NL*
real
thing
,
the
meeting
of
the
kiss
and
the
dream
,
the
nuptial
pillow
.
*NL*
All
the
torments
through
which
they
had
passed
came
back
to
them
in
*NL*
intoxication
.
It
seemed
to
them
that
their
sorrows
,
their
sleepless
*NL*
nights
,
their
tears
,
their
anguish
,
their
terrors
,
their
despair
,
*NL*
converted
into
caresses
and
rays
of
light
,
rendered
still
more
charming
*NL*
the
charming
hour
which
was
approaching
;
and
that
their
griefs
were
but
*NL*
so
many
handmaidens
who
were
preparing
the
toilet
of
joy
.
How
good
it
is
*NL*
to
have
suffered
!
Their
unhappiness
formed
a
halo
round
their
happiness
.
*NL*
The
long
agony
of
their
love
was
terminating
in
an
ascension
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
same
enchantment
in
two
souls
,
tinged
with
voluptuousness
*NL*
in
Marius
,
and
with
modesty
in
Cosette
.
They
said
to
each
other
in
low
*NL*
tones
:
``
We
will
go
back
to
take
a
look
at
our
little
garden
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Plumet
.
''
The
folds
of
Cosette
's
gown
lay
across
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
day
is
an
ineffable
mixture
of
dream
and
of
reality
.
One
*NL*
possesses
and
one
supposes
.
One
still
has
time
before
one
to
divine
.
The
*NL*
emotion
on
that
day
,
of
being
at
mid-day
and
of
dreaming
of
midnight
*NL*
is
indescribable
.
The
delights
of
these
two
hearts
overflowed
upon
the
*NL*
crowd
,
and
inspired
the
passers-by
with
cheerfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
halted
in
the
Rue
Saint-Antoine
,
in
front
of
Saint-Paul
,
to
gaze
*NL*
through
the
windows
of
the
carriage
at
the
orange-flowers
quivering
on
*NL*
Cosette
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
returned
home
to
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
.
Marius
,
*NL*
triumphant
and
radiant
,
mounted
side
by
side
with
Cosette
the
staircase
*NL*
up
which
he
had
been
borne
in
a
dying
condition
.
The
poor
,
who
had
*NL*
trooped
to
the
door
,
and
who
shared
their
purses
,
blessed
them
.
There
*NL*
were
flowers
everywhere
.
The
house
was
no
less
fragrant
than
the
church
;
*NL*
after
the
incense
,
roses
.
They
thought
they
heard
voices
carolling
in
*NL*
the
infinite
;
they
had
God
in
their
hearts
;
destiny
appeared
to
them
*NL*
like
a
ceiling
of
stars
;
above
their
heads
they
beheld
the
light
of
a
*NL*
rising
sun
.
All
at
once
,
the
clock
struck
.
Marius
glanced
at
Cosette
's
*NL*
charming
bare
arm
,
and
at
the
rosy
things
which
were
vaguely
visible
*NL*
through
the
lace
of
her
bodice
,
and
Cosette
,
intercepting
Marius
'
*NL*
glance
,
blushed
to
her
very
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Quite
a
number
of
old
family
friends
of
the
Gillenormand
family
had
*NL*
been
invited
;
they
pressed
about
Cosette
.
Each
one
vied
with
the
rest
in
*NL*
saluting
her
as
Madame
la
Baronne
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
,
Theodule
Gillenormand
,
now
a
captain
,
had
come
from
*NL*
Chartres
,
where
he
was
stationed
in
garrison
,
to
be
present
at
the
*NL*
wedding
of
his
cousin
Pontmercy
.
Cosette
did
not
recognize
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
,
on
his
side
,
habituated
as
he
was
to
have
women
consider
him
*NL*
handsome
,
retained
no
more
recollection
of
Cosette
than
of
any
other
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
right
I
was
not
to
believe
in
that
story
about
the
lancer
!
''
said
*NL*
Father
Gillenormand
,
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
never
been
more
tender
with
Jean
Valjean
.
She
was
in
unison
*NL*
with
Father
Gillenormand
;
while
he
erected
joy
into
aphorisms
and
*NL*
maxims
,
she
exhaled
goodness
like
a
perfume
.
Happiness
desires
that
all
*NL*
the
world
should
be
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
regained
,
for
the
purpose
of
addressing
Jean
Valjean
,
inflections
of
*NL*
voice
belonging
to
the
time
when
she
was
a
little
girl
.
She
caressed
him
*NL*
with
her
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
banquet
had
been
spread
in
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Illumination
as
brilliant
as
the
daylight
is
the
necessary
seasoning
of
*NL*
a
great
joy
.
Mist
and
obscurity
are
not
accepted
by
the
happy
.
They
do
*NL*
not
consent
to
be
black
.
The
night
,
yes
;
the
shadows
,
no
.
If
there
is
no
*NL*
sun
,
one
must
be
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dining-room
was
full
of
gay
things
.
In
the
centre
,
above
the
white
*NL*
and
glittering
table
,
was
a
Venetian
lustre
with
flat
plates
,
with
all
*NL*
sorts
of
colored
birds
,
blue
,
violet
,
red
,
and
green
,
perched
amid
the
*NL*
candles
;
around
the
chandelier
,
girandoles
,
on
the
walls
,
sconces
with
*NL*
triple
and
quintuple
branches
;
mirrors
,
silverware
,
glassware
,
plate
,
*NL*
porcelain
,
faience
,
pottery
,
gold
and
silversmith
's
work
,
all
was
*NL*
sparkling
and
gay
.
The
empty
spaces
between
the
candelabra
were
filled
*NL*
in
with
bouquets
,
so
that
where
there
was
not
a
light
,
there
was
a
*NL*
flower
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
antechamber
,
three
violins
and
a
flute
softly
played
quartettes
*NL*
by
Haydn
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
seated
himself
on
a
chair
in
the
drawing-room
,
behind
*NL*
the
door
,
the
leaf
of
which
folded
back
upon
him
in
such
a
manner
as
to
*NL*
nearly
conceal
him
.
A
few
moments
before
they
sat
down
to
table
,
Cosette
*NL*
came
,
as
though
inspired
by
a
sudden
whim
,
and
made
him
a
deep
courtesy
,
*NL*
spreading
out
her
bridal
toilet
with
both
hands
,
and
with
a
tenderly
*NL*
roguish
glance
,
she
asked
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
are
you
satisfied
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
am
content
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
later
,
Basque
announced
that
dinner
was
served
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
guests
,
preceded
by
M.
Gillenormand
with
Cosette
on
his
arm
,
entered
*NL*
the
dining-room
,
and
arranged
themselves
in
the
proper
order
around
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
large
arm-chairs
figured
on
the
right
and
left
of
the
bride
,
the
*NL*
first
for
M.
Gillenormand
,
the
other
for
Jean
Valjean
.
M.
Gillenormand
*NL*
took
his
seat
.
The
other
arm-chair
remained
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
about
for
M.
Fauchelevent
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
longer
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
M.
Gillenormand
questioned
Basque
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
M.
Fauchelevent
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
replied
Basque
,
``
I
do
,
precisely
.
M.
Fauchelevent
told
me
to
say
*NL*
to
you
,
sir
,
that
he
was
suffering
,
his
injured
hand
was
paining
him
*NL*
somewhat
,
and
that
he
could
not
dine
with
Monsieur
le
Baron
and
Madame
*NL*
la
Baronne
.
That
he
begged
to
be
excused
,
that
he
would
come
to-morrow
.
*NL*
He
has
just
taken
his
departure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
empty
arm-chair
chilled
the
effusion
of
the
wedding
feast
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
But
,
if
M.
Fauchelevent
was
absent
,
M.
Gillenormand
was
present
,
*NL*
and
the
grandfather
beamed
for
two
.
He
affirmed
that
M.
Fauchelevent
had
*NL*
done
well
to
retire
early
,
if
he
were
suffering
,
but
that
it
was
only
a
*NL*
slight
ailment
.
This
declaration
sufficed
.
Moreover
,
what
is
an
obscure
*NL*
corner
in
such
a
submersion
of
joy
?
Cosette
and
Marius
were
passing
*NL*
through
one
of
those
egotistical
and
blessed
moments
when
no
other
*NL*
faculty
is
left
to
a
person
than
that
of
receiving
happiness
.
And
then
,
*NL*
an
idea
occurred
to
M.
Gillenormand
.
--
``
Pardieu
,
this
armchair
is
empty
.
*NL*
Come
hither
,
Marius
.
Your
aunt
will
permit
it
,
although
she
has
a
*NL*
right
to
you
.
This
armchair
is
for
you
.
That
is
legal
and
delightful
.
*NL*
Fortunatus
beside
Fortunata
.
''
--
Applause
from
the
whole
table
.
Marius
*NL*
took
Jean
Valjean
's
place
beside
Cosette
,
and
things
fell
out
so
that
*NL*
Cosette
,
who
had
,
at
first
,
been
saddened
by
Jean
Valjean
's
absence
,
*NL*
ended
by
being
satisfied
with
it
.
From
the
moment
when
Marius
took
his
*NL*
place
,
and
was
the
substitute
,
Cosette
would
not
have
regretted
God
*NL*
himself
.
She
set
her
sweet
little
foot
,
shod
in
white
satin
,
on
Marius
'
*NL*
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arm-chair
being
occupied
,
M.
Fauchelevent
was
obliterated
;
and
*NL*
nothing
was
lacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
five
minutes
afterward
,
the
whole
table
from
one
end
to
the
other
,
*NL*
was
laughing
with
all
the
animation
of
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
dessert
,
M.
Gillenormand
,
rising
to
his
feet
,
with
a
glass
of
*NL*
champagne
in
his
hand
--
only
half
full
so
that
the
palsy
of
his
eighty
*NL*
years
might
not
cause
an
overflow
,
--
proposed
the
health
of
the
married
*NL*
pair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
not
escape
two
sermons
,
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
This
morning
you
*NL*
had
one
from
the
cure
,
this
evening
you
shall
have
one
from
your
*NL*
grandfather
.
Listen
to
me
;
I
will
give
you
a
bit
of
advice
:
Adore
each
*NL*
other
.
I
do
not
make
a
pack
of
gyrations
,
I
go
straight
to
the
mark
,
*NL*
be
happy
.
In
all
creation
,
only
the
turtle-doves
are
wise
.
Philosophers
*NL*
say
:
`
Moderate
your
joys
.
'
I
say
:
`
Give
rein
to
your
joys
.
'
Be
as
*NL*
much
smitten
with
each
other
as
fiends
.
Be
in
a
rage
about
it
.
The
*NL*
philosophers
talk
stuff
and
nonsense
.
I
should
like
to
stuff
their
*NL*
philosophy
down
their
gullets
again
.
Can
there
be
too
many
perfumes
,
*NL*
too
many
open
rose-buds
,
too
many
nightingales
singing
,
too
many
green
*NL*
leaves
,
too
much
aurora
in
life
?
can
people
love
each
other
too
much
?
*NL*
can
people
please
each
other
too
much
?
Take
care
,
Estelle
,
thou
art
too
*NL*
pretty
!
Have
a
care
,
Nemorin
,
thou
art
too
handsome
!
Fine
stupidity
,
*NL*
in
sooth
!
Can
people
enchant
each
other
too
much
,
cajole
each
other
too
*NL*
much
,
charm
each
other
too
much
?
Can
one
be
too
much
alive
,
too
happy
?
*NL*
Moderate
your
joys
.
Ah
,
indeed
!
Down
with
the
philosophers
!
Wisdom
*NL*
consists
in
jubilation
.
Make
merry
,
let
us
make
merry
.
Are
we
happy
*NL*
because
we
are
good
,
or
are
we
good
because
we
are
happy
?
Is
the
Sancy
*NL*
diamond
called
the
Sancy
because
it
belonged
to
Harley
de
Sancy
,
or
*NL*
because
it
weighs
six
hundred
carats
?
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
life
is
*NL*
full
of
such
problems
;
the
important
point
is
to
possess
the
Sancy
and
*NL*
happiness
.
Let
us
be
happy
without
quibbling
and
quirking
.
Let
us
obey
*NL*
the
sun
blindly
.
What
is
the
sun
?
It
is
love
.
He
who
says
love
,
says
*NL*
woman
.
Ah
!
ah
!
behold
omnipotence
--
women
.
Ask
that
demagogue
of
a
Marius
*NL*
if
he
is
not
the
slave
of
that
little
tyrant
of
a
Cosette
.
And
of
his
*NL*
own
free
will
,
too
,
the
coward
!
Woman
!
There
is
no
Robespierre
who
keeps
*NL*
his
place
but
woman
reigns
.
I
am
no
longer
Royalist
except
towards
that
*NL*
royalty
.
What
is
Adam
?
The
kingdom
of
Eve
.
No
'89
for
Eve
.
There
has
*NL*
been
the
royal
sceptre
surmounted
by
a
fleur-de-lys
,
there
has
been
the
*NL*
imperial
sceptre
surmounted
by
a
globe
,
there
has
been
the
sceptre
of
*NL*
Charlemagne
,
which
was
of
iron
,
there
has
been
the
sceptre
of
Louis
the
*NL*
Great
,
which
was
of
gold
,
--
the
revolution
twisted
them
between
its
thumb
*NL*
and
forefinger
,
ha
`
penny
straws
;
it
is
done
with
,
it
is
broken
,
it
lies
*NL*
on
the
earth
,
there
is
no
longer
any
sceptre
,
but
make
me
a
revolution
*NL*
against
that
little
embroidered
handkerchief
,
which
smells
of
patchouli
!
*NL*
I
should
like
to
see
you
do
it
.
Try
.
Why
is
it
so
solid
?
Because
it
is
a
*NL*
gewgaw
.
Ah
!
you
are
the
nineteenth
century
?
Well
,
what
then
?
And
we
*NL*
have
been
as
foolish
as
you
.
Do
not
imagine
that
you
have
effected
*NL*
much
change
in
the
universe
,
because
your
trip-gallant
is
called
the
*NL*
cholera-morbus
,
and
because
your
pourree
is
called
the
cachuca
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
the
women
must
always
be
loved
.
I
defy
you
to
escape
from
that
.
These
*NL*
friends
are
our
angels
.
Yes
,
love
,
woman
,
the
kiss
forms
a
circle
from
*NL*
which
I
defy
you
to
escape
;
and
,
for
my
own
part
,
I
should
be
only
*NL*
too
happy
to
re-enter
it
.
Which
of
you
has
seen
the
planet
Venus
,
the
*NL*
coquette
of
the
abyss
,
the
Celimene
of
the
ocean
,
rise
in
the
infinite
,
*NL*
calming
all
here
below
?
The
ocean
is
a
rough
Alcestis
.
Well
,
grumble
*NL*
as
he
will
,
when
Venus
appears
he
is
forced
to
smile
.
That
brute
beast
*NL*
submits
.
We
are
all
made
so
.
Wrath
,
tempest
,
claps
of
thunder
,
foam
to
*NL*
the
very
ceiling
.
A
woman
enters
on
the
scene
,
a
planet
rises
;
flat
on
*NL*
your
face
!
Marius
was
fighting
six
months
ago
;
to-day
he
is
married
.
*NL*
That
is
well
.
Yes
,
Marius
,
yes
,
Cosette
,
you
are
in
the
right
.
Exist
*NL*
boldly
for
each
other
,
make
us
burst
with
rage
that
we
can
not
do
the
*NL*
same
,
idealize
each
other
,
catch
in
your
beaks
all
the
tiny
blades
of
*NL*
felicity
that
exist
on
earth
,
and
arrange
yourselves
a
nest
for
life
.
*NL*
Pardi
,
to
love
,
to
be
loved
,
what
a
fine
miracle
when
one
is
young
!
*NL*
Do
n't
imagine
that
you
have
invented
that
.
I
,
too
,
have
had
my
dream
,
I
,
*NL*
too
,
have
meditated
,
I
,
too
,
have
sighed
;
I
,
too
,
have
had
a
moonlight
*NL*
soul
.
Love
is
a
child
six
thousand
years
old
.
Love
has
the
right
to
a
*NL*
long
white
beard
.
Methusalem
is
a
street
arab
beside
Cupid
.
For
sixty
*NL*
centuries
men
and
women
have
got
out
of
their
scrape
by
loving
.
The
*NL*
devil
,
who
is
cunning
,
took
to
hating
man
;
man
,
who
is
still
more
*NL*
cunning
,
took
to
loving
woman
.
In
this
way
he
does
more
good
than
*NL*
the
devil
does
him
harm
.
This
craft
was
discovered
in
the
days
of
*NL*
the
terrestrial
paradise
.
The
invention
is
old
,
my
friends
,
but
it
is
*NL*
perfectly
new
.
Profit
by
it
.
Be
Daphnis
and
Chloe
,
while
waiting
to
*NL*
become
Philemon
and
Baucis
.
Manage
so
that
,
when
you
are
with
each
*NL*
other
,
nothing
shall
be
lacking
to
you
,
and
that
Cosette
may
be
the
sun
*NL*
for
Marius
,
and
that
Marius
may
be
the
universe
to
Cosette
.
Cosette
,
let
*NL*
your
fine
weather
be
the
smile
of
your
husband
;
Marius
,
let
your
rain
*NL*
be
your
wife
's
tears
.
And
let
it
never
rain
in
your
household
.
You
have
*NL*
filched
the
winning
number
in
the
lottery
;
you
have
gained
the
great
*NL*
prize
,
guard
it
well
,
keep
it
under
lock
and
key
,
do
not
squander
it
,
*NL*
adore
each
other
and
snap
your
fingers
at
all
the
rest
.
Believe
what
I
*NL*
say
to
you
.
It
is
good
sense
.
And
good
sense
can
not
lie
.
Be
a
religion
*NL*
to
each
other
.
Each
man
has
his
own
fashion
of
adoring
God
.
Saperlotte
!
*NL*
the
best
way
to
adore
God
is
to
love
one
's
wife
.
I
love
thee
!
that
's
*NL*
my
catechism
.
He
who
loves
is
orthodox
.
The
oath
of
Henri
IV
.
places
*NL*
sanctity
somewhere
between
feasting
and
drunkenness
.
Ventre-saint-gris
!
*NL*
I
do
n't
belong
to
the
religion
of
that
oath
.
Woman
is
forgotten
in
it
.
*NL*
This
astonishes
me
on
the
part
of
Henri
IV
.
My
friends
,
long
live
women
!
*NL*
I
am
old
,
they
say
;
it
's
astonishing
how
much
I
feel
in
the
mood
to
*NL*
be
young
.
I
should
like
to
go
and
listen
to
the
bagpipes
in
the
woods
.
*NL*
Children
who
contrive
to
be
beautiful
and
contented
,
--
that
intoxicates
*NL*
me
.
I
would
like
greatly
to
get
married
,
if
any
one
would
have
me
.
It
is
*NL*
impossible
to
imagine
that
God
could
have
made
us
for
anything
but
this
:
*NL*
to
idolize
,
to
coo
,
to
preen
ourselves
,
to
be
dove-like
,
to
be
dainty
,
*NL*
to
bill
and
coo
our
loves
from
morn
to
night
,
to
gaze
at
one
's
image
in
*NL*
one
's
little
wife
,
to
be
proud
,
to
be
triumphant
,
to
plume
oneself
;
that
*NL*
is
the
aim
of
life
.
There
,
let
not
that
displease
you
which
we
used
to
*NL*
think
in
our
day
,
when
we
were
young
folks
.
Ah
!
vertu-bamboche
!
what
*NL*
charming
women
there
were
in
those
days
,
and
what
pretty
little
faces
*NL*
and
what
lovely
lasses
!
I
committed
my
ravages
among
them
.
Then
love
*NL*
each
other
.
If
people
did
not
love
each
other
,
I
really
do
not
see
what
*NL*
use
there
would
be
in
having
any
springtime
;
and
for
my
own
part
,
I
*NL*
should
pray
the
good
God
to
shut
up
all
the
beautiful
things
that
he
*NL*
shows
us
,
and
to
take
away
from
us
and
put
back
in
his
box
,
the
flowers
,
*NL*
the
birds
,
and
the
pretty
maidens
.
My
children
,
receive
an
old
man
's
*NL*
blessing

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
gay
,
lively
and
agreeable
.
The
grandfather
's
sovereign
*NL*
good
humor
gave
the
key-note
to
the
whole
feast
,
and
each
person
*NL*
regulated
his
conduct
on
that
almost
centenarian
cordiality
.
They
danced
*NL*
a
little
,
they
laughed
a
great
deal
;
it
was
an
amiable
wedding
.
Goodman
*NL*
Days
of
Yore
might
have
been
invited
to
it
.
However
,
he
was
present
in
*NL*
the
person
of
Father
Gillenormand
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
tumult
,
then
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
married
pair
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
little
after
midnight
,
the
Gillenormand
house
became
a
temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
we
pause
.
On
the
threshold
of
wedding
nights
stands
a
smiling
angel
*NL*
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
soul
enters
into
contemplation
before
that
sanctuary
where
the
*NL*
celebration
of
love
takes
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
should
be
flashes
of
light
athwart
such
houses
.
The
joy
which
*NL*
they
contain
ought
to
make
its
escape
through
the
stones
of
the
walls
in
*NL*
brilliancy
,
and
vaguely
illuminate
the
gloom
.
It
is
impossible
that
this
*NL*
sacred
and
fatal
festival
should
not
give
off
a
celestial
radiance
to
*NL*
the
infinite
.
Love
is
the
sublime
crucible
wherein
the
fusion
of
the
man
*NL*
and
the
woman
takes
place
;
the
being
one
,
the
being
triple
,
the
being
*NL*
final
,
the
human
trinity
proceeds
from
it
.
This
birth
of
two
souls
into
*NL*
one
,
ought
to
be
an
emotion
for
the
gloom
.
The
lover
is
the
priest
;
*NL*
the
ravished
virgin
is
terrified
.
Something
of
that
joy
ascends
to
God
.
*NL*
Where
true
marriage
is
,
that
is
to
say
,
where
there
is
love
,
the
ideal
*NL*
enters
in
.
A
nuptial
bed
makes
a
nook
of
dawn
amid
the
shadows
.
If
it
*NL*
were
given
to
the
eye
of
the
flesh
to
scan
the
formidable
and
charming
*NL*
visions
of
the
upper
life
,
it
is
probable
that
we
should
behold
the
*NL*
forms
of
night
,
the
winged
unknowns
,
the
blue
passers
of
the
invisible
,
*NL*
bend
down
,
a
throng
of
sombre
heads
,
around
the
luminous
house
,
*NL*
satisfied
,
showering
benedictions
,
pointing
out
to
each
other
the
virgin
*NL*
wife
gently
alarmed
,
sweetly
terrified
,
and
bearing
the
reflection
of
*NL*
human
bliss
upon
their
divine
countenances
.
If
at
that
supreme
hour
,
the
*NL*
wedded
pair
,
dazzled
with
voluptuousness
and
believing
themselves
alone
,
*NL*
were
to
listen
,
they
would
hear
in
their
chamber
a
confused
rustling
of
*NL*
wings
.
Perfect
happiness
implies
a
mutual
understanding
with
the
angels
.
*NL*
That
dark
little
chamber
has
all
heaven
for
its
ceiling
.
When
two
*NL*
mouths
,
rendered
sacred
by
love
,
approach
to
create
,
it
is
impossible
*NL*
that
there
should
not
be
,
above
that
ineffable
kiss
,
a
quivering
*NL*
throughout
the
immense
mystery
of
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
felicities
are
the
true
ones
.
There
is
no
joy
outside
of
these
*NL*
joys
.
Love
is
the
only
ecstasy
.
All
the
rest
weeps
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
love
,
or
to
have
loved
,
--
this
suffices
.
Demand
nothing
more
.
There
*NL*
is
no
other
pearl
to
be
found
in
the
shadowy
folds
of
life
.
To
love
is
a
*NL*
fulfilment
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THE
INSEPARABLE
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
become
of
Jean
Valjean
?
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
having
laughed
,
at
Cosette
's
graceful
command
,
when
*NL*
no
one
was
paying
any
heed
to
him
,
Jean
Valjean
had
risen
and
had
gained
*NL*
the
antechamber
unperceived
.
This
was
the
very
room
which
,
eight
months
*NL*
before
,
he
had
entered
black
with
mud
,
with
blood
and
powder
,
bringing
*NL*
back
the
grandson
to
the
grandfather
.
The
old
wainscoting
was
garlanded
*NL*
with
foliage
and
flowers
;
the
musicians
were
seated
on
the
sofa
on
which
*NL*
they
had
laid
Marius
down
.
Basque
,
in
a
black
coat
,
knee-breeches
,
white
*NL*
stockings
and
white
gloves
,
was
arranging
roses
round
all
of
the
dishes
*NL*
that
were
to
be
served
.
Jean
Valjean
pointed
to
his
arm
in
its
sling
,
*NL*
charged
Basque
to
explain
his
absence
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
long
windows
of
the
dining-room
opened
on
the
street
.
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
stood
for
several
minutes
,
erect
and
motionless
in
the
darkness
,
beneath
*NL*
those
radiant
windows
.
He
listened
.
The
confused
sounds
of
the
banquet
*NL*
reached
his
ear
.
He
heard
the
loud
,
commanding
tones
of
the
grandfather
,
*NL*
the
violins
,
the
clatter
of
the
plates
,
the
bursts
of
laughter
,
and
*NL*
through
all
that
merry
uproar
,
he
distinguished
Cosette
's
sweet
and
*NL*
joyous
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
quitted
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
and
returned
to
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
order
to
return
thither
,
he
took
the
Rue
Saint-Louis
,
the
Rue
*NL*
Culture-Sainte-Catherine
,
and
the
Blancs-Manteaux
;
it
was
a
little
*NL*
longer
,
but
it
was
the
road
through
which
,
for
the
last
three
months
,
*NL*
he
had
become
accustomed
to
pass
every
day
on
his
way
from
the
Rue
de
*NL*
l'Homme
Arme
to
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
,
in
order
to
avoid
the
*NL*
obstructions
and
the
mud
in
the
Rue
Vielle-du-Temple
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
road
,
through
which
Cosette
had
passed
,
excluded
for
him
all
*NL*
possibility
of
any
other
itinerary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
entered
his
lodgings
.
He
lighted
his
candle
and
mounted
*NL*
the
stairs
.
The
apartment
was
empty
.
Even
Toussaint
was
no
longer
there
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
step
made
more
noise
than
usual
in
the
chambers
.
All
the
*NL*
cupboards
stood
open
.
He
penetrated
to
Cosette
's
bedroom
.
There
were
no
*NL*
sheets
on
the
bed
.
The
pillow
,
covered
with
ticking
,
and
without
a
case
*NL*
or
lace
,
was
laid
on
the
blankets
folded
up
on
the
foot
of
the
mattress
,
*NL*
whose
covering
was
visible
,
and
on
which
no
one
was
ever
to
sleep
again
.
*NL*
All
the
little
feminine
objects
which
Cosette
was
attached
to
had
been
*NL*
carried
away
;
nothing
remained
except
the
heavy
furniture
and
the
four
*NL*
walls
.
Toussaint
's
bed
was
despoiled
in
like
manner
.
One
bed
only
was
*NL*
made
up
,
and
seemed
to
be
waiting
some
one
,
and
this
was
Jean
Valjean
's
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
looked
at
the
walls
,
closed
some
of
the
cupboard
doors
,
and
*NL*
went
and
came
from
one
room
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
sought
his
own
chamber
once
more
,
and
set
his
candle
on
a
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
disengaged
his
arm
from
the
sling
,
and
he
used
his
right
hand
as
*NL*
though
it
did
not
hurt
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
his
bed
,
and
his
eyes
rested
,
was
it
by
chance
?
was
it
*NL*
intentionally
?
on
the
inseparable
of
which
Cosette
had
been
jealous
,
on
*NL*
the
little
portmanteau
which
never
left
him
.
On
his
arrival
in
the
Rue
*NL*
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
on
the
4th
of
June
,
he
had
deposited
it
on
a
round
*NL*
table
near
the
head
of
his
bed
.
He
went
to
this
table
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
vivacity
,
took
a
key
from
his
pocket
,
and
opened
the
valise
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
it
he
slowly
drew
forth
the
garments
in
which
,
ten
years
before
,
*NL*
Cosette
had
quitted
Montfermeil
;
first
the
little
gown
,
then
the
black
*NL*
fichu
,
then
the
stout
,
coarse
child
's
shoes
which
Cosette
might
almost
*NL*
have
worn
still
,
so
tiny
were
her
feet
,
then
the
fustian
bodice
,
which
*NL*
was
very
thick
,
then
the
knitted
petticoat
,
next
the
apron
with
pockets
,
*NL*
then
the
woollen
stockings
.
These
stockings
,
which
still
preserved
the
*NL*
graceful
form
of
a
tiny
leg
,
were
no
longer
than
Jean
Valjean
's
hand
.
*NL*
All
this
was
black
of
hue
.
It
was
he
who
had
brought
those
garments
to
*NL*
Montfermeil
for
her
.
As
he
removed
them
from
the
valise
,
he
laid
them
on
*NL*
the
bed
.
He
fell
to
thinking
.
He
called
up
memories
.
It
was
in
winter
,
*NL*
in
a
very
cold
month
of
December
,
she
was
shivering
,
half-naked
,
in
*NL*
rags
,
her
poor
little
feet
were
all
red
in
their
wooden
shoes
.
He
,
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
had
made
her
abandon
those
rags
to
clothe
herself
in
these
*NL*
mourning
habiliments
.
The
mother
must
have
felt
pleased
in
her
grave
,
to
*NL*
see
her
daughter
wearing
mourning
for
her
,
and
,
above
all
,
to
see
that
*NL*
she
was
properly
clothed
,
and
that
she
was
warm
.
He
thought
of
that
*NL*
forest
of
Montfermeil
;
they
had
traversed
it
together
,
Cosette
and
he
;
*NL*
he
thought
of
what
the
weather
had
been
,
of
the
leafless
trees
,
of
the
*NL*
wood
destitute
of
birds
,
of
the
sunless
sky
;
it
mattered
not
,
it
was
*NL*
charming
.
He
arranged
the
tiny
garments
on
the
bed
,
the
fichu
next
to
*NL*
the
petticoat
,
the
stockings
beside
the
shoes
,
and
he
looked
at
them
,
*NL*
one
after
the
other
.
She
was
no
taller
than
that
,
she
had
her
big
doll
*NL*
in
her
arms
,
she
had
put
her
louis
d'or
in
the
pocket
of
that
apron
,
she
*NL*
had
laughed
,
they
walked
hand
in
hand
,
she
had
no
one
in
the
world
but
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
venerable
,
white
head
fell
forward
on
the
bed
,
that
stoical
old
*NL*
heart
broke
,
his
face
was
engulfed
,
so
to
speak
,
in
Cosette
's
garments
,
*NL*
and
if
any
one
had
passed
up
the
stairs
at
that
moment
,
he
would
have
*NL*
heard
frightful
sobs
.

CHAPTER
IV
--
THE
IMMORTAL
LIVER
-LSB-
68
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
and
formidable
struggle
,
of
which
we
have
already
witnessed
so
*NL*
many
phases
,
began
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacob
struggled
with
the
angel
but
one
night
.
Alas
!
how
many
times
have
*NL*
we
beheld
Jean
Valjean
seized
bodily
by
his
conscience
,
in
the
darkness
,
*NL*
and
struggling
desperately
against
it
!
*NL*
*NL*
Unheard-of
conflict
!
At
certain
moments
the
foot
slips
;
at
other
moments
*NL*
the
ground
crumbles
away
underfoot
.
How
many
times
had
that
conscience
,
*NL*
mad
for
the
good
,
clasped
and
overthrown
him
!
How
many
times
had
the
*NL*
truth
set
her
knee
inexorably
upon
his
breast
!
How
many
times
,
hurled
*NL*
to
earth
by
the
light
,
had
he
begged
for
mercy
!
How
many
times
had
*NL*
that
implacable
spark
,
lighted
within
him
,
and
upon
him
by
the
Bishop
,
*NL*
dazzled
him
by
force
when
he
had
wished
to
be
blind
!
How
many
times
*NL*
had
he
risen
to
his
feet
in
the
combat
,
held
fast
to
the
rock
,
leaning
*NL*
against
sophism
,
dragged
in
the
dust
,
now
getting
the
upper
hand
of
his
*NL*
conscience
,
again
overthrown
by
it
!
How
many
times
,
after
an
equivoque
,
*NL*
after
the
specious
and
treacherous
reasoning
of
egotism
,
had
he
heard
*NL*
his
irritated
conscience
cry
in
his
ear
:
``
A
trip
!
you
wretch
!
''
How
many
*NL*
times
had
his
refractory
thoughts
rattled
convulsively
in
his
throat
,
*NL*
under
the
evidence
of
duty
!
Resistance
to
God
.
Funereal
sweats
.
What
*NL*
secret
wounds
which
he
alone
felt
bleed
!
What
excoriations
in
his
*NL*
lamentable
existence
!
How
many
times
he
had
risen
bleeding
,
bruised
,
*NL*
broken
,
enlightened
,
despair
in
his
heart
,
serenity
in
his
soul
!
*NL*
and
,
vanquished
,
he
had
felt
himself
the
conqueror
.
And
,
after
having
*NL*
dislocated
,
broken
,
and
rent
his
conscience
with
red-hot
pincers
,
it
had
*NL*
said
to
him
,
as
it
stood
over
him
,
formidable
,
luminous
,
and
tranquil
:
*NL*
``
Now
,
go
in
peace
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
on
emerging
from
so
melancholy
a
conflict
,
what
a
lugubrious
peace
,
*NL*
alas
!
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
that
night
Jean
Valjean
felt
that
he
was
passing
through
*NL*
his
final
combat
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
heart-rending
question
presented
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Predestinations
are
not
all
direct
;
they
do
not
open
out
in
a
straight
*NL*
avenue
before
the
predestined
man
;
they
have
blind
courts
,
impassable
*NL*
alleys
,
obscure
turns
,
disturbing
crossroads
offering
the
choice
of
many
*NL*
ways
.
Jean
Valjean
had
halted
at
that
moment
at
the
most
perilous
of
*NL*
these
crossroads
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
come
to
the
supreme
crossing
of
good
and
evil
.
He
had
that
*NL*
gloomy
intersection
beneath
his
eyes
.
On
this
occasion
once
more
,
as
had
*NL*
happened
to
him
already
in
other
sad
vicissitudes
,
two
roads
opened
out
*NL*
before
him
,
the
one
tempting
,
the
other
alarming
.
*NL*
*NL*
Which
was
he
to
take
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
counselled
to
the
one
which
alarmed
him
by
that
mysterious
index
*NL*
finger
which
we
all
perceive
whenever
we
fix
our
eyes
on
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
more
,
Jean
Valjean
had
the
choice
between
the
terrible
port
and
the
*NL*
smiling
ambush
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
then
true
?
the
soul
may
recover
;
but
not
fate
.
Frightful
thing
!
an
*NL*
incurable
destiny
!
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
the
problem
which
presented
itself
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
In
what
manner
was
Jean
Valjean
to
behave
in
relation
to
the
happiness
*NL*
of
Cosette
and
Marius
?
It
was
he
who
had
willed
that
happiness
,
it
was
*NL*
he
who
had
brought
it
about
;
he
had
,
himself
,
buried
it
in
his
entrails
,
*NL*
and
at
that
moment
,
when
he
reflected
on
it
,
he
was
able
to
enjoy
the
*NL*
sort
of
satisfaction
which
an
armorer
would
experience
on
recognizing
*NL*
his
factory
mark
on
a
knife
,
on
withdrawing
it
,
all
smoking
,
from
his
*NL*
own
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
Marius
,
Marius
possessed
Cosette
.
They
had
everything
,
even
*NL*
riches
.
And
this
was
his
doing
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
was
he
,
Jean
Valjean
,
to
do
with
this
happiness
,
now
that
*NL*
it
existed
,
now
that
it
was
there
?
Should
he
force
himself
on
this
*NL*
happiness
?
Should
he
treat
it
as
belonging
to
him
?
No
doubt
,
Cosette
did
*NL*
belong
to
another
;
but
should
he
,
Jean
Valjean
,
retain
of
Cosette
all
*NL*
that
he
could
retain
?
Should
he
remain
the
sort
of
father
,
half
seen
but
*NL*
respected
,
which
he
had
hitherto
been
?
Should
he
,
without
saying
a
*NL*
word
,
bring
his
past
to
that
future
?
Should
he
present
himself
there
,
*NL*
as
though
he
had
a
right
,
and
should
he
seat
himself
,
veiled
,
at
that
*NL*
luminous
fireside
?
Should
he
take
those
innocent
hands
into
his
tragic
*NL*
hands
,
with
a
smile
?
Should
he
place
upon
the
peaceful
fender
of
the
*NL*
Gillenormand
drawing-room
those
feet
of
his
,
which
dragged
behind
them
*NL*
the
disgraceful
shadow
of
the
law
?
Should
he
enter
into
participation
in
*NL*
the
fair
fortunes
of
Cosette
and
Marius
?
Should
he
render
the
obscurity
*NL*
on
his
brow
and
the
cloud
upon
theirs
still
more
dense
?
Should
he
*NL*
place
his
catastrophe
as
a
third
associate
in
their
felicity
?
Should
he
*NL*
continue
to
hold
his
peace
?
In
a
word
,
should
he
be
the
sinister
mute
of
*NL*
destiny
beside
these
two
happy
beings
?
*NL*
*NL*
We
must
have
become
habituated
to
fatality
and
to
encounters
with
it
,
in
*NL*
order
to
have
the
daring
to
raise
our
eyes
when
certain
questions
appear
*NL*
to
us
in
all
their
horrible
nakedness
.
Good
or
evil
stands
behind
*NL*
this
severe
interrogation
point
.
What
are
you
going
to
do
?
demands
the
*NL*
sphinx
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
habit
of
trial
Jean
Valjean
possessed
.
He
gazed
intently
at
the
*NL*
sphinx
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
examined
the
pitiless
problem
under
all
its
aspects
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
that
charming
existence
,
was
the
raft
of
this
shipwreck
.
What
*NL*
was
he
to
do
?
To
cling
fast
to
it
,
or
to
let
go
his
hold
?
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
clung
to
it
,
he
should
emerge
from
disaster
,
he
should
ascend
*NL*
again
into
the
sunlight
,
he
should
let
the
bitter
water
drip
from
his
*NL*
garments
and
his
hair
,
he
was
saved
,
he
should
live
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
if
he
let
go
his
hold
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
abyss
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
took
sad
council
with
his
thoughts
.
Or
,
to
speak
more
correctly
,
*NL*
he
fought
;
he
kicked
furiously
internally
,
now
against
his
will
,
now
*NL*
against
his
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
Jean
Valjean
that
he
had
been
able
to
weep
.
That
relieved
*NL*
him
,
possibly
.
But
the
beginning
was
savage
.
A
tempest
,
more
furious
*NL*
than
the
one
which
had
formerly
driven
him
to
Arras
,
broke
loose
within
*NL*
him
.
The
past
surged
up
before
him
facing
the
present
;
he
compared
*NL*
them
and
sobbed
.
The
silence
of
tears
once
opened
,
the
despairing
man
*NL*
writhed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
that
he
had
been
stopped
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
in
this
fight
to
the
death
between
our
egotism
and
our
duty
,
when
*NL*
we
thus
retreat
step
by
step
before
our
immutable
ideal
,
bewildered
,
*NL*
furious
,
exasperated
at
having
to
yield
,
disputing
the
ground
,
hoping
*NL*
for
a
possible
flight
,
seeking
an
escape
,
what
an
abrupt
and
sinister
*NL*
resistance
does
the
foot
of
the
wall
offer
in
our
rear
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
feel
the
sacred
shadow
which
forms
an
obstacle
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
invisible
inexorable
,
what
an
obsession
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
one
is
never
done
with
conscience
.
Make
your
choice
,
Brutus
;
make
*NL*
your
choice
,
Cato
.
It
is
fathomless
,
since
it
is
God
.
One
flings
into
*NL*
that
well
the
labor
of
one
's
whole
life
,
one
flings
in
one
's
fortune
,
*NL*
one
flings
in
one
's
riches
,
one
flings
in
one
's
success
,
one
flings
in
*NL*
one
's
liberty
or
fatherland
,
one
flings
in
one
's
well-being
,
one
flings
*NL*
in
one
's
repose
,
one
flings
in
one
's
joy
!
More
!
more
!
more
!
Empty
the
*NL*
vase
!
tip
the
urn
!
One
must
finish
by
flinging
in
one
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somewhere
in
the
fog
of
the
ancient
hells
,
there
is
a
tun
like
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
not
one
pardonable
,
if
one
at
last
refuses
!
Can
the
inexhaustible
*NL*
have
any
right
?
Are
not
chains
which
are
endless
above
human
strength
?
*NL*
Who
would
blame
Sisyphus
and
Jean
Valjean
for
saying
:
``
It
is
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
obedience
of
matter
is
limited
by
friction
;
is
there
no
limit
to
the
*NL*
obedience
of
the
soul
?
If
perpetual
motion
is
impossible
,
can
perpetual
*NL*
self-sacrifice
be
exacted
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
step
is
nothing
,
it
is
the
last
which
is
difficult
.
What
was
*NL*
the
Champmathieu
affair
in
comparison
with
Cosette
's
marriage
and
of
*NL*
that
which
it
entailed
?
What
is
a
re-entrance
into
the
galleys
,
compared
*NL*
to
entrance
into
the
void
?
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
first
step
that
must
be
descended
,
how
sombre
art
thou
!
Oh
,
second
*NL*
step
,
how
black
art
thou
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
he
refrain
from
turning
aside
his
head
this
time
?
*NL*
*NL*
Martyrdom
is
sublimation
,
corrosive
sublimation
.
It
is
a
torture
which
*NL*
consecrates
.
One
can
consent
to
it
for
the
first
hour
;
one
seats
oneself
*NL*
on
the
throne
of
glowing
iron
,
one
places
on
one
's
head
the
crown
of
hot
*NL*
iron
,
one
accepts
the
globe
of
red
hot
iron
,
one
takes
the
sceptre
of
*NL*
red
hot
iron
,
but
the
mantle
of
flame
still
remains
to
be
donned
,
and
*NL*
comes
there
not
a
moment
when
the
miserable
flesh
revolts
and
when
one
*NL*
abdicates
from
suffering
?
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
Jean
Valjean
entered
into
the
peace
of
exhaustion
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
weighed
,
he
reflected
,
he
considered
the
alternatives
,
the
mysterious
*NL*
balance
of
light
and
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Should
he
impose
his
galleys
on
those
two
dazzling
children
,
or
should
*NL*
he
consummate
his
irremediable
engulfment
by
himself
?
On
one
side
lay
*NL*
the
sacrifice
of
Cosette
,
on
the
other
that
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
what
solution
should
he
arrive
?
What
decision
did
he
come
to
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
resolution
did
he
take
?
What
was
his
own
inward
definitive
response
*NL*
to
the
unbribable
interrogatory
of
fatality
?
What
door
did
he
decide
to
*NL*
open
?
Which
side
of
his
life
did
he
resolve
upon
closing
and
condemning
?
*NL*
Among
all
the
unfathomable
precipices
which
surrounded
him
,
which
was
*NL*
his
choice
?
What
extremity
did
he
accept
?
To
which
of
the
gulfs
did
he
*NL*
nod
his
head
?
*NL*
*NL*
His
dizzy
revery
lasted
all
night
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
there
until
daylight
,
in
the
same
attitude
,
bent
double
over
*NL*
that
bed
,
prostrate
beneath
the
enormity
of
fate
,
crushed
,
perchance
,
*NL*
alas
!
with
clenched
fists
,
with
arms
outspread
at
right
angles
,
like
a
*NL*
man
crucified
who
has
been
un-nailed
,
and
flung
face
down
on
the
earth
.
*NL*
There
he
remained
for
twelve
hours
,
the
twelve
long
hours
of
a
long
*NL*
winter
's
night
,
ice-cold
,
without
once
raising
his
head
,
and
without
*NL*
uttering
a
word
.
He
was
as
motionless
as
a
corpse
,
while
his
thoughts
*NL*
wallowed
on
the
earth
and
soared
,
now
like
the
hydra
,
now
like
the
*NL*
eagle
.
Any
one
to
behold
him
thus
motionless
would
have
pronounced
him
*NL*
dead
;
all
at
once
he
shuddered
convulsively
,
and
his
mouth
,
glued
to
*NL*
Cosette
's
garments
,
kissed
them
;
then
it
could
be
seen
that
he
was
*NL*
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
could
see
?
Since
Jean
Valjean
was
alone
,
and
there
was
no
one
there
.

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
SEVENTH
CIRCLE
AND
THE
EIGHTH
HEAVEN
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
that
follow
weddings
are
solitary
.
People
respect
the
*NL*
meditations
of
the
happy
pair
.
And
also
,
their
tardy
slumbers
,
to
some
*NL*
degree
.
The
tumult
of
visits
and
congratulations
only
begins
later
on
.
*NL*
On
the
morning
of
the
17th
of
February
,
it
was
a
little
past
midday
when
*NL*
Basque
,
with
napkin
and
feather-duster
under
his
arm
,
busy
in
setting
*NL*
his
antechamber
to
rights
,
heard
a
light
tap
at
the
door
.
There
had
been
*NL*
no
ring
,
which
was
discreet
on
such
a
day
.
Basque
opened
the
door
,
and
*NL*
beheld
M.
Fauchelevent
.
He
introduced
him
into
the
drawing-room
,
still
*NL*
encumbered
and
topsy-turvy
,
and
which
bore
the
air
of
a
field
of
battle
*NL*
after
the
joys
of
the
preceding
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dame
,
sir
,
''
remarked
Basque
,
``
we
all
woke
up
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
your
master
up
?
''
asked
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
Monsieur
's
arm
?
''
replied
Basque
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
.
Is
your
master
up
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
one
?
the
old
one
or
the
new
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Pontmercy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
''
said
Basque
,
drawing
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
is
a
Baron
most
of
all
to
his
servants
.
He
counts
for
something
*NL*
with
them
;
they
are
what
a
philosopher
would
call
,
bespattered
with
the
*NL*
title
,
and
that
flatters
them
.
Marius
,
be
it
said
in
passing
,
a
militant
*NL*
republican
as
he
had
proved
,
was
now
a
Baron
in
spite
of
himself
.
A
*NL*
small
revolution
had
taken
place
in
the
family
in
connection
with
*NL*
this
title
.
It
was
now
M.
Gillenormand
who
clung
to
it
,
and
Marius
who
*NL*
detached
himself
from
it
.
But
Colonel
Pontmercy
had
written
:
``
My
son
*NL*
will
bear
my
title
.
''
Marius
obeyed
.
And
then
,
Cosette
,
in
whom
the
woman
*NL*
was
beginning
to
dawn
,
was
delighted
to
be
a
Baroness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
?
''
repeated
Basque
.
``
I
will
go
and
see
.
I
will
tell
*NL*
him
that
M.
Fauchelevent
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Do
not
tell
him
that
it
is
I.
Tell
him
that
some
one
wishes
to
*NL*
speak
to
him
in
private
,
and
mention
no
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
ejaculated
Basque
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
surprise
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
ejaculated
Basque
once
more
,
emitting
his
second
``
ah
!
''
as
an
*NL*
explanation
of
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
remained
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
drawing-room
,
as
we
have
just
said
,
was
in
great
disorder
.
It
seemed
*NL*
as
though
,
by
lending
an
air
,
one
might
still
hear
the
vague
noise
of
*NL*
the
wedding
.
On
the
polished
floor
lay
all
sorts
of
flowers
which
*NL*
had
fallen
from
garlands
and
head-dresses
.
The
wax
candles
,
burned
*NL*
to
stumps
,
added
stalactites
of
wax
to
the
crystal
drops
of
the
*NL*
chandeliers
.
Not
a
single
piece
of
furniture
was
in
its
place
.
In
the
*NL*
corners
,
three
or
four
arm-chairs
,
drawn
close
together
in
a
circle
,
*NL*
had
the
appearance
of
continuing
a
conversation
.
The
whole
effect
was
*NL*
cheerful
.
A
certain
grace
still
lingers
round
a
dead
feast
.
It
has
been
*NL*
a
happy
thing
.
On
the
chairs
in
disarray
,
among
those
fading
flowers
,
*NL*
beneath
those
extinct
lights
,
people
have
thought
of
joy
.
The
sun
*NL*
had
succeeded
to
the
chandelier
,
and
made
its
way
gayly
into
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Several
minutes
elapsed
.
Jean
Valjean
stood
motionless
on
the
spot
where
*NL*
Basque
had
left
him
.
He
was
very
pale
.
His
eyes
were
hollow
,
and
so
*NL*
sunken
in
his
head
by
sleeplessness
that
they
nearly
disappeared
in
*NL*
their
orbits
.
His
black
coat
bore
the
weary
folds
of
a
garment
that
*NL*
has
been
up
all
night
.
The
elbows
were
whitened
with
the
down
which
the
*NL*
friction
of
cloth
against
linen
leaves
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stared
at
the
window
outlined
on
the
polished
floor
at
his
*NL*
feet
by
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
sound
at
the
door
,
and
he
raised
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
entered
,
his
head
well
up
,
his
mouth
smiling
,
an
indescribable
*NL*
light
on
his
countenance
,
his
brow
expanded
,
his
eyes
triumphant
.
He
had
*NL*
not
slept
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
you
,
father
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
on
catching
sight
of
Jean
Valjean
;
*NL*
``
that
idiot
of
a
Basque
had
such
a
mysterious
air
!
But
you
have
come
too
*NL*
early
.
It
is
only
half
past
twelve
.
Cosette
is
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
word
:
``
Father
,
''
said
to
M.
Fauchelevent
by
Marius
,
signified
:
*NL*
supreme
felicity
.
There
had
always
existed
,
as
the
reader
knows
,
a
lofty
*NL*
wall
,
a
coldness
and
a
constraint
between
them
;
ice
which
must
be
broken
*NL*
or
melted
.
Marius
had
reached
that
point
of
intoxication
when
the
wall
*NL*
was
lowered
,
when
the
ice
dissolved
,
and
when
M.
Fauchelevent
was
to
*NL*
him
,
as
to
Cosette
,
a
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
continued
:
his
words
poured
forth
,
as
is
the
peculiarity
of
divine
*NL*
paroxysms
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
glad
I
am
to
see
you
!
If
you
only
knew
how
we
missed
you
yesterday
!
*NL*
Good
morning
,
father
.
How
is
your
hand
?
Better
,
is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
satisfied
with
the
favorable
reply
which
he
had
made
to
himself
,
he
*NL*
pursued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
both
been
talking
about
you
.
Cosette
loves
you
so
dearly
!
You
*NL*
must
not
forget
that
you
have
a
chamber
here
,
We
want
nothing
more
to
*NL*
do
with
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
.
We
will
have
no
more
of
it
at
all
.
How
*NL*
could
you
go
to
live
in
a
street
like
that
,
which
is
sickly
,
which
is
*NL*
disagreeable
,
which
is
ugly
,
which
has
a
barrier
at
one
end
,
where
one
*NL*
is
cold
,
and
into
which
one
can
not
enter
?
You
are
to
come
and
install
*NL*
yourself
here
.
And
this
very
day
.
Or
you
will
have
to
deal
with
Cosette
.
*NL*
She
means
to
lead
us
all
by
the
nose
,
I
warn
you
.
You
have
your
own
*NL*
chamber
here
,
it
is
close
to
ours
,
it
opens
on
the
garden
;
the
trouble
*NL*
with
the
clock
has
been
attended
to
,
the
bed
is
made
,
it
is
all
ready
,
*NL*
you
have
only
to
take
possession
of
it
.
Near
your
bed
Cosette
has
placed
*NL*
a
huge
,
old
,
easy-chair
covered
with
Utrecht
velvet
and
she
has
said
to
*NL*
it
:
`
Stretch
out
your
arms
to
him
.
'
A
nightingale
comes
to
the
clump
of
*NL*
acacias
opposite
your
windows
,
every
spring
.
In
two
months
more
you
will
*NL*
have
it
.
You
will
have
its
nest
on
your
left
and
ours
on
your
right
.
By
*NL*
night
it
will
sing
,
and
by
day
Cosette
will
prattle
.
Your
chamber
faces
*NL*
due
South
.
Cosette
will
arrange
your
books
for
you
,
your
Voyages
of
*NL*
Captain
Cook
and
the
other
,
--
Vancouver
's
and
all
your
affairs
.
I
believe
*NL*
that
there
is
a
little
valise
to
which
you
are
attached
,
I
have
fixed
*NL*
upon
a
corner
of
honor
for
that
.
You
have
conquered
my
grandfather
,
you
*NL*
suit
him
.
We
will
live
together
.
Do
you
play
whist
?
you
will
overwhelm
*NL*
my
grandfather
with
delight
if
you
play
whist
.
It
is
you
who
shall
take
*NL*
Cosette
to
walk
on
the
days
when
I
am
at
the
courts
,
you
shall
give
her
*NL*
your
arm
,
you
know
,
as
you
used
to
,
in
the
Luxembourg
.
We
are
absolutely
*NL*
resolved
to
be
happy
.
And
you
shall
be
included
in
it
,
in
our
happiness
,
*NL*
do
you
hear
,
father
?
Come
,
will
you
breakfast
with
us
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
have
something
to
say
to
you
.
I
am
an
*NL*
ex-convict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
limit
of
shrill
sounds
perceptible
can
be
overleaped
,
as
well
in
*NL*
the
case
of
the
mind
as
in
that
of
the
ear
.
These
words
:
``
I
am
an
*NL*
ex-convict
,
''
proceeding
from
the
mouth
of
M.
Fauchelevent
and
entering
*NL*
the
ear
of
Marius
overshot
the
possible
.
It
seemed
to
him
that
something
*NL*
had
just
been
said
to
him
;
but
he
did
not
know
what
.
He
stood
with
his
*NL*
mouth
wide
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
perceived
that
the
man
who
was
addressing
him
was
frightful
.
*NL*
Wholly
absorbed
in
his
own
dazzled
state
,
he
had
not
,
up
to
that
moment
,
*NL*
observed
the
other
man
's
terrible
pallor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
untied
the
black
cravat
which
supported
his
right
arm
,
*NL*
unrolled
the
linen
from
around
his
hand
,
bared
his
thumb
and
showed
it
*NL*
to
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
the
matter
with
my
hand
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
looked
at
the
thumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has
not
been
anything
the
matter
with
it
,
''
went
on
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
in
fact
,
no
trace
of
any
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
fitting
that
I
should
be
absent
from
your
marriage
.
I
absented
*NL*
myself
as
much
as
was
in
my
power
.
So
I
invented
this
injury
in
order
*NL*
that
I
might
not
commit
a
forgery
,
that
I
might
not
introduce
a
flaw
*NL*
into
the
marriage
documents
,
in
order
that
I
might
escape
from
signing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
meaning
of
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
meaning
of
it
is
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
,
``
that
I
have
been
in
the
*NL*
galleys
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
driving
me
mad
!
''
exclaimed
Marius
in
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
was
nineteen
years
in
the
*NL*
galleys
.
For
theft
.
Then
,
I
was
condemned
for
life
for
theft
,
for
a
*NL*
second
offence
.
At
the
present
moment
,
I
have
broken
my
ban
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
did
Marius
recoil
before
the
reality
,
refuse
the
fact
,
resist
*NL*
the
evidence
,
he
was
forced
to
give
way
.
He
began
to
understand
,
and
,
as
*NL*
always
happens
in
such
cases
,
he
understood
too
much
.
An
inward
shudder
*NL*
of
hideous
enlightenment
flashed
through
him
;
an
idea
which
made
him
*NL*
quiver
traversed
his
mind
.
He
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
wretched
destiny
for
*NL*
himself
in
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
all
,
say
all
!
''
he
cried
.
``
You
are
Cosette
's
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
retreated
a
couple
of
paces
with
a
movement
of
indescribable
*NL*
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
elevated
his
head
with
so
much
majesty
of
attitude
that
he
*NL*
seemed
to
grow
even
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
necessary
that
you
should
believe
me
here
,
sir
;
although
our
oath
*NL*
to
others
may
not
be
received
in
law
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
paused
,
then
,
with
a
sort
of
sovereign
and
sepulchral
authority
,
*NL*
he
added
,
articulating
slowly
,
and
emphasizing
the
syllables
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
You
will
believe
me
.
I
the
father
of
Cosette
!
before
God
,
no
.
*NL*
Monsieur
le
Baron
Pontmercy
,
I
am
a
peasant
of
Faverolles
.
I
earned
my
*NL*
living
by
pruning
trees
.
My
name
is
not
Fauchelevent
,
but
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
I
am
not
related
to
Cosette
.
Reassure
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
will
prove
that
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
.
Since
I
tell
you
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
looked
at
the
man
.
He
was
melancholy
yet
tranquil
.
No
lie
could
*NL*
proceed
from
such
a
calm
.
That
which
is
icy
is
sincere
.
The
truth
could
*NL*
be
felt
in
that
chill
of
the
tomb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
bent
his
head
,
as
though
taking
note
of
this
,
and
*NL*
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
to
Cosette
?
A
passer-by
.
Ten
years
ago
,
I
did
not
know
that
*NL*
she
was
in
existence
.
I
love
her
,
it
is
true
.
One
loves
a
child
whom
one
*NL*
has
seen
when
very
young
,
being
old
oneself
.
When
one
is
old
,
one
feels
*NL*
oneself
a
grandfather
towards
all
little
children
.
You
may
,
it
seems
to
*NL*
me
,
suppose
that
I
have
something
which
resembles
a
heart
.
She
was
an
*NL*
orphan
.
Without
either
father
or
mother
.
She
needed
me
.
That
is
why
I
*NL*
began
to
love
her
.
Children
are
so
weak
that
the
first
comer
,
even
a
man
*NL*
like
me
,
can
become
their
protector
.
I
have
fulfilled
this
duty
towards
*NL*
Cosette
.
I
do
not
think
that
so
slight
a
thing
can
be
called
a
good
*NL*
action
;
but
if
it
be
a
good
action
,
well
,
say
that
I
have
done
it
.
*NL*
Register
this
attenuating
circumstance
.
To-day
,
Cosette
passes
out
of
my
*NL*
life
;
our
two
roads
part
.
Henceforth
,
I
can
do
nothing
for
her
.
She
is
*NL*
Madame
Pontmercy
.
Her
providence
has
changed
.
And
Cosette
gains
by
the
*NL*
change
.
All
is
well
.
As
for
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
,
you
do
not
*NL*
mention
them
to
me
,
but
I
forestall
your
thought
,
they
are
a
deposit
.
*NL*
How
did
that
deposit
come
into
my
hands
?
What
does
that
matter
?
I
*NL*
restore
the
deposit
.
Nothing
more
can
be
demanded
of
me
.
I
complete
*NL*
the
restitution
by
announcing
my
true
name
.
That
concerns
me
.
I
have
a
*NL*
reason
for
desiring
that
you
should
know
who
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Jean
Valjean
looked
Marius
full
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
Marius
experienced
was
tumultuous
and
incoherent
.
Certain
gusts
*NL*
of
destiny
produce
these
billows
in
our
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
have
all
undergone
moments
of
trouble
in
which
everything
within
us
*NL*
is
dispersed
;
we
say
the
first
things
that
occur
to
us
,
which
are
*NL*
not
always
precisely
those
which
should
be
said
.
There
are
sudden
*NL*
revelations
which
one
can
not
bear
,
and
which
intoxicate
like
baleful
*NL*
wine
.
Marius
was
stupefied
by
the
novel
situation
which
presented
itself
*NL*
to
him
,
to
the
point
of
addressing
that
man
almost
like
a
person
who
was
*NL*
angry
with
him
for
this
avowal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
``
do
you
tell
me
all
this
?
Who
forces
you
to
*NL*
do
so
?
You
could
have
kept
your
secret
to
yourself
.
You
are
neither
*NL*
denounced
,
nor
tracked
nor
pursued
.
You
have
a
reason
for
wantonly
*NL*
making
such
a
revelation
.
Conclude
.
There
is
something
more
.
In
what
*NL*
connection
do
you
make
this
confession
?
What
is
your
motive
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
motive
?
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
in
a
voice
so
low
and
dull
that
one
*NL*
would
have
said
that
he
was
talking
to
himself
rather
than
to
Marius
.
*NL*
``
From
what
motive
,
in
fact
,
has
this
convict
just
said
'
I
am
a
convict
'
?
*NL*
Well
,
yes
!
the
motive
is
strange
.
It
is
out
of
honesty
.
Stay
,
the
*NL*
unfortunate
point
is
that
I
have
a
thread
in
my
heart
,
which
keeps
me
*NL*
fast
.
It
is
when
one
is
old
that
that
sort
of
thread
is
particularly
*NL*
solid
.
All
life
falls
in
ruin
around
one
;
one
resists
.
Had
I
been
able
*NL*
to
tear
out
that
thread
,
to
break
it
,
to
undo
the
knot
or
to
cut
it
,
to
*NL*
go
far
away
,
I
should
have
been
safe
.
I
had
only
to
go
away
;
there
are
*NL*
diligences
in
the
Rue
Bouloy
;
you
are
happy
;
I
am
going
.
I
have
tried
*NL*
to
break
that
thread
,
I
have
jerked
at
it
,
it
would
not
break
,
I
tore
my
*NL*
heart
with
it
.
Then
I
said
:
'
I
can
not
live
anywhere
else
than
here
.
'
I
*NL*
must
stay
.
Well
,
yes
,
you
are
right
,
I
am
a
fool
,
why
not
simply
*NL*
remain
here
?
You
offer
me
a
chamber
in
this
house
,
Madame
Pontmercy
is
*NL*
sincerely
attached
to
me
,
she
said
to
the
arm-chair
:
`
Stretch
out
your
*NL*
arms
to
him
,
'
your
grandfather
demands
nothing
better
than
to
have
me
,
I
*NL*
suit
him
,
we
shall
live
together
,
and
take
our
meals
in
common
,
I
shall
*NL*
give
Cosette
my
arm
...
Madame
Pontmercy
,
excuse
me
,
it
is
a
habit
,
we
*NL*
shall
have
but
one
roof
,
one
table
,
one
fire
,
the
same
chimney-corner
*NL*
in
winter
,
the
same
promenade
in
summer
,
that
is
joy
,
that
is
happiness
,
*NL*
that
is
everything
.
We
shall
live
as
one
family
.
One
family
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
word
,
Jean
Valjean
became
wild
.
He
folded
his
arms
,
glared
at
*NL*
the
floor
beneath
his
feet
as
though
he
would
have
excavated
an
abyss
*NL*
therein
,
and
his
voice
suddenly
rose
in
thundering
tones
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
one
family
!
No
.
I
belong
to
no
family
.
I
do
not
belong
to
yours
.
*NL*
I
do
not
belong
to
any
family
of
men
.
In
houses
where
people
are
among
*NL*
themselves
,
I
am
superfluous
.
There
are
families
,
but
there
is
nothing
*NL*
of
the
sort
for
me
.
I
am
an
unlucky
wretch
;
I
am
left
outside
.
Did
I
*NL*
have
a
father
and
mother
?
I
almost
doubt
it
.
On
the
day
when
I
gave
that
*NL*
child
in
marriage
,
all
came
to
an
end
.
I
have
seen
her
happy
,
and
that
*NL*
she
is
with
a
man
whom
she
loves
,
and
that
there
exists
here
a
kind
old
*NL*
man
,
a
household
of
two
angels
,
and
all
joys
in
that
house
,
and
that
it
*NL*
was
well
,
I
said
to
myself
:
`
Enter
thou
not
.
'
I
could
have
lied
,
it
is
*NL*
true
,
have
deceived
you
all
,
and
remained
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
.
So
long
*NL*
as
it
was
for
her
,
I
could
lie
;
but
now
it
would
be
for
myself
,
and
I
*NL*
must
not
.
It
was
sufficient
for
me
to
hold
my
peace
,
it
is
true
,
and
all
*NL*
would
go
on
.
You
ask
me
what
has
forced
me
to
speak
?
a
very
odd
thing
;
*NL*
my
conscience
.
To
hold
my
peace
was
very
easy
,
however
.
I
passed
the
*NL*
night
in
trying
to
persuade
myself
to
it
;
you
questioned
me
,
and
what
I
*NL*
have
just
said
to
you
is
so
extraordinary
that
you
have
the
right
to
do
*NL*
it
;
well
,
yes
,
I
have
passed
the
night
in
alleging
reasons
to
myself
,
*NL*
and
I
gave
myself
very
good
reasons
,
I
have
done
what
I
could
.
But
there
*NL*
are
two
things
in
which
I
have
not
succeeded
;
in
breaking
the
thread
*NL*
that
holds
me
fixed
,
riveted
and
sealed
here
by
the
heart
,
or
in
*NL*
silencing
some
one
who
speaks
softly
to
me
when
I
am
alone
.
That
is
why
*NL*
I
have
come
hither
to
tell
you
everything
this
morning
.
Everything
or
*NL*
nearly
everything
.
It
is
useless
to
tell
you
that
which
concerns
only
*NL*
myself
;
I
keep
that
to
myself
.
You
know
the
essential
points
.
So
I
have
*NL*
taken
my
mystery
and
have
brought
it
to
you
.
And
I
have
disembowelled
my
*NL*
secret
before
your
eyes
.
It
was
not
a
resolution
that
was
easy
to
take
.
*NL*
I
struggled
all
night
long
.
Ah
!
you
think
that
I
did
not
tell
myself
*NL*
that
this
was
no
Champmathieu
affair
,
that
by
concealing
my
name
I
was
*NL*
doing
no
one
any
injury
,
that
the
name
of
Fauchelevent
had
been
given
to
*NL*
me
by
Fauchelevent
himself
,
out
of
gratitude
for
a
service
rendered
to
*NL*
him
,
and
that
I
might
assuredly
keep
it
,
and
that
I
should
be
happy
in
*NL*
that
chamber
which
you
offer
me
,
that
I
should
not
be
in
any
one
's
way
,
*NL*
that
I
should
be
in
my
own
little
corner
,
and
that
,
while
you
would
have
*NL*
Cosette
,
I
should
have
the
idea
that
I
was
in
the
same
house
with
her
.
*NL*
Each
one
of
us
would
have
had
his
share
of
happiness
.
If
I
continued
to
*NL*
be
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
,
that
would
arrange
everything
.
Yes
,
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
my
soul
.
There
was
joy
everywhere
upon
my
surface
,
but
the
*NL*
bottom
of
my
soul
remained
black
.
It
is
not
enough
to
be
happy
,
one
must
*NL*
be
content
.
Thus
I
should
have
remained
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
,
thus
*NL*
I
should
have
concealed
my
true
visage
,
thus
,
in
the
presence
of
your
*NL*
expansion
,
I
should
have
had
an
enigma
,
thus
,
in
the
midst
of
your
full
*NL*
noonday
,
I
should
have
had
shadows
,
thus
,
without
crying
''
ware
,
'
I
*NL*
should
have
simply
introduced
the
galleys
to
your
fireside
,
I
should
*NL*
have
taken
my
seat
at
your
table
with
the
thought
that
if
you
knew
who
*NL*
I
was
,
you
would
drive
me
from
it
,
I
should
have
allowed
myself
to
*NL*
be
served
by
domestics
who
,
had
they
known
,
would
have
said
:
`
How
*NL*
horrible
!
'
I
should
have
touched
you
with
my
elbow
,
which
you
have
a
*NL*
right
to
dislike
,
I
should
have
filched
your
clasps
of
the
hand
!
There
*NL*
would
have
existed
in
your
house
a
division
of
respect
between
venerable
*NL*
white
locks
and
tainted
white
locks
;
at
your
most
intimate
hours
,
when
*NL*
all
hearts
thought
themselves
open
to
the
very
bottom
to
all
the
rest
,
*NL*
when
we
four
were
together
,
your
grandfather
,
you
two
and
myself
,
a
*NL*
stranger
would
have
been
present
!
I
should
have
been
side
by
side
with
*NL*
you
in
your
existence
,
having
for
my
only
care
not
to
disarrange
the
*NL*
cover
of
my
dreadful
pit
.
Thus
,
I
,
a
dead
man
,
should
have
thrust
myself
*NL*
upon
you
who
are
living
beings
.
I
should
have
condemned
her
to
myself
*NL*
forever
.
You
and
Cosette
and
I
would
have
had
all
three
of
our
heads
in
*NL*
the
green
cap
!
Does
it
not
make
you
shudder
?
I
am
only
the
most
crushed
*NL*
of
men
;
I
should
have
been
the
most
monstrous
of
men
.
And
I
should
have
*NL*
committed
that
crime
every
day
!
And
I
should
have
had
that
face
of
night
*NL*
upon
my
visage
every
day
!
every
day
!
And
I
should
have
communicated
to
*NL*
you
a
share
in
my
taint
every
day
!
every
day
!
to
you
,
my
dearly
beloved
,
*NL*
my
children
,
to
you
,
my
innocent
creatures
!
Is
it
nothing
to
hold
one
's
*NL*
peace
?
is
it
a
simple
matter
to
keep
silence
?
No
,
it
is
not
simple
.
*NL*
There
is
a
silence
which
lies
.
And
my
lie
,
and
my
fraud
and
my
*NL*
indignity
,
and
my
cowardice
and
my
treason
and
my
crime
,
I
should
have
*NL*
drained
drop
by
drop
,
I
should
have
spit
it
out
,
then
swallowed
it
*NL*
again
,
I
should
have
finished
at
midnight
and
have
begun
again
at
*NL*
midday
,
and
my
`
good
morning
'
would
have
lied
,
and
my
`
good
night
'
would
*NL*
have
lied
,
and
I
should
have
slept
on
it
,
I
should
have
eaten
it
,
with
*NL*
my
bread
,
and
I
should
have
looked
Cosette
in
the
face
,
and
I
should
*NL*
have
responded
to
the
smile
of
the
angel
by
the
smile
of
the
damned
*NL*
soul
,
and
I
should
have
been
an
abominable
villain
!
Why
should
I
do
*NL*
it
?
in
order
to
be
happy
.
In
order
to
be
happy
.
Have
I
the
right
to
be
*NL*
happy
?
I
stand
outside
of
life
,
Sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
paused
.
Marius
listened
.
Such
chains
of
ideas
and
of
*NL*
anguishes
can
not
be
interrupted
.
Jean
Valjean
lowered
his
voice
once
*NL*
more
,
but
it
was
no
longer
a
dull
voice
--
it
was
a
sinister
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ask
why
I
speak
?
I
am
neither
denounced
,
nor
pursued
,
nor
tracked
,
*NL*
you
say
.
Yes
!
I
am
denounced
!
yes
!
I
am
tracked
!
By
whom
?
By
myself
.
*NL*
It
is
I
who
bar
the
passage
to
myself
,
and
I
drag
myself
,
and
I
push
*NL*
myself
,
and
I
arrest
myself
,
and
I
execute
myself
,
and
when
one
holds
*NL*
oneself
,
one
is
firmly
held
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
seizing
a
handful
of
his
own
coat
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
and
*NL*
extending
it
towards
Marius
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
see
that
fist
?
''
he
continued
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
that
it
holds
*NL*
that
collar
in
such
a
wise
as
not
to
release
it
?
Well
!
conscience
*NL*
is
another
grasp
!
If
one
desires
to
be
happy
,
sir
,
one
must
never
*NL*
understand
duty
;
for
,
as
soon
as
one
has
comprehended
it
,
it
is
*NL*
implacable
.
One
would
say
that
it
punished
you
for
comprehending
it
;
*NL*
but
no
,
it
rewards
you
;
for
it
places
you
in
a
hell
,
where
you
feel
God
*NL*
beside
you
.
One
has
no
sooner
lacerated
his
own
entrails
than
he
is
at
*NL*
peace
with
himself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
with
a
poignant
accent
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
this
is
not
common
sense
,
I
am
an
honest
man
.
It
is
*NL*
by
degrading
myself
in
your
eyes
that
I
elevate
myself
in
my
own
.
This
*NL*
has
happened
to
me
once
before
,
but
it
was
less
painful
then
;
it
was
*NL*
a
mere
nothing
.
Yes
,
an
honest
man
.
I
should
not
be
so
if
,
through
my
*NL*
fault
,
you
had
continued
to
esteem
me
;
now
that
you
despise
me
,
I
am
so
.
*NL*
I
have
that
fatality
hanging
over
me
that
,
not
being
able
to
ever
have
*NL*
anything
but
stolen
consideration
,
that
consideration
humiliates
me
,
*NL*
and
crushes
me
inwardly
,
and
,
in
order
that
I
may
respect
myself
,
it
is
*NL*
necessary
that
I
should
be
despised
.
Then
I
straighten
up
again
.
I
am
*NL*
a
galley-slave
who
obeys
his
conscience
.
I
know
well
that
that
is
most
*NL*
improbable
.
But
what
would
you
have
me
do
about
it
?
it
is
the
fact
.
*NL*
I
have
entered
into
engagements
with
myself
;
I
keep
them
.
There
are
*NL*
encounters
which
bind
us
,
there
are
chances
which
involve
us
in
duties
.
*NL*
You
see
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
various
things
have
happened
to
me
in
the
*NL*
course
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
Jean
Valjean
paused
,
swallowing
his
saliva
with
an
effort
,
as
*NL*
though
his
words
had
a
bitter
after-taste
,
and
then
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
one
has
such
a
horror
hanging
over
one
,
one
has
not
the
right
to
*NL*
make
others
share
it
without
their
knowledge
,
one
has
not
the
right
to
*NL*
make
them
slip
over
one
's
own
precipice
without
their
perceiving
it
,
*NL*
one
has
not
the
right
to
let
one
's
red
blouse
drag
upon
them
,
one
has
no
*NL*
right
to
slyly
encumber
with
one
's
misery
the
happiness
of
others
.
It
is
*NL*
hideous
to
approach
those
who
are
healthy
,
and
to
touch
them
in
the
dark
*NL*
with
one
's
ulcer
.
In
spite
of
the
fact
that
Fauchelevent
lent
me
his
*NL*
name
,
I
have
no
right
to
use
it
;
he
could
give
it
to
me
,
but
I
could
not
*NL*
take
it
.
A
name
is
an
_
I

.
You
see
,
sir
,
that
I
have
thought
somewhat
,
I
*NL*
have
read
a
little
,
although
I
am
a
peasant
;
and
you
see
that
I
*NL*
express
myself
properly
.
I
understand
things
.
I
have
procured
myself
an
*NL*
education
.
Well
,
yes
,
to
abstract
a
name
and
to
place
oneself
under
it
*NL*
is
dishonest
.
Letters
of
the
alphabet
can
be
filched
,
like
a
purse
or
a
*NL*
watch
.
To
be
a
false
signature
in
flesh
and
blood
,
to
be
a
living
false
*NL*
key
,
to
enter
the
house
of
honest
people
by
picking
their
lock
,
never
*NL*
more
to
look
straightforward
,
to
forever
eye
askance
,
to
be
infamous
*NL*
within
the
_
I
_
,
no
!
no
!
no
!
no
!
no

It
is
better
to
suffer
,
to
bleed
,
to
*NL*
weep
,
to
tear
one
's
skin
from
the
flesh
with
one
's
nails
,
to
pass
nights
*NL*
writhing
in
anguish
,
to
devour
oneself
body
and
soul
.
That
is
why
I
have
*NL*
just
told
you
all
this
.
Wantonly
,
as
you
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
painful
breath
,
and
hurled
this
final
word
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
days
gone
by
,
I
stole
a
loaf
of
bread
in
order
to
live
;
to-day
,
in
*NL*
order
to
live
,
I
will
not
steal
a
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
live
!
''
interrupted
Marius
.
``
You
do
not
need
that
name
in
order
to
*NL*
live
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
understand
the
matter
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
raising
and
lowering
*NL*
his
head
several
times
in
succession
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
ensued
.
Both
held
their
peace
,
each
plunged
in
a
gulf
of
*NL*
thoughts
.
Marius
was
sitting
near
a
table
and
resting
the
corner
of
his
*NL*
mouth
on
one
of
his
fingers
,
which
was
folded
back
.
Jean
Valjean
was
*NL*
pacing
to
and
fro
.
He
paused
before
a
mirror
,
and
remained
motionless
.
*NL*
Then
,
as
though
replying
to
some
inward
course
of
reasoning
,
he
said
,
as
*NL*
he
gazed
at
the
mirror
,
which
he
did
not
see
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
,
at
present
,
I
am
relieved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
up
his
march
again
,
and
walked
to
the
other
end
of
the
*NL*
drawing-room
.
At
the
moment
when
he
turned
round
,
he
perceived
that
*NL*
Marius
was
watching
his
walk
.
Then
he
said
,
with
an
inexpressible
*NL*
intonation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
drag
my
leg
a
little
.
Now
you
understand
why
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
fully
round
towards
Marius
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
sir
,
imagine
this
:
I
have
said
nothing
,
I
have
remained
*NL*

Fauchelevent

I
have
taken
my
place
in
your
house
,
I
am
one
of
*NL*
you
,
I
am
in
my
chamber

I
come
to
breakfast
in
the
morning
in
slippers
,
*NL*
in
the
evening
all
three
of
us
go
to
the
play
,
I
accompany
Madame
*NL*
Pontmercy
to
the
Tuileries
,
and
to
the
Place
Royale
,
we
are
together

*NL*
you
think
me
your
equal
;
one
fine
day
you
are
there
,
and
I
am
there
,
we
*NL*
are
conversing
,
we
are
laughing
;
all
at
once
,
you
hear
a
voice
shouting
*NL*
this
name
:
`
Jean
Valjean
!
'
and
behold
,
that
terrible
hand
,
the
police
,
*NL*
darts
from
the
darkness
,
and
abruptly
tears
off
my
mask
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
paused
;
Marius
had
sprung
to
his
feet
with
a
shudder
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
silence
answered
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
that
I
am
right
in
not
holding
my
peace

Be
happy
,
be
*NL*
in
heaven
,
be
the
angel
of
an
angel
,
exist
in
the
sun
,
be
content
*NL*
therewith
,
and
do
not
trouble
yourself
about
the
means
which
a
poor
*NL*
damned
wretch
takes
to
open
his
breast
and
force
his
duty
to
come
forth
;
*NL*
you
have
before
you

sir
,
a
wretched
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
slowly
crossed
the
room
,
and
,
when
he
was
quite
close
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
he
offered
the
latter
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Marius
was
obliged
to
step
up
and
take
that
hand
which
was
not
*NL*
offered
,
Jean
Valjean
let
him
have
his
own
way
,
and
it
seemed
to
Marius
*NL*
that
he
pressed
a
hand
of
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
grandfather
has
friends
,
''
said
Marius
;
``
I
will
procure
your
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
useless
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
``
I
am
believed
to
be
dead
,
and
*NL*
that
suffices
.
The
dead
are
not
subjected
to
surveillance
.
They
are
*NL*
supposed
to
rot
in
peace
.
Death
is
the
same
thing
as
pardon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
disengaging
the
hand
which
Marius
held
,
he
added
,
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
inexorable
dignity
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moreover
,
the
friend
to
whom
I
have
recourse
is
the
doing
of
my
duty
;
*NL*
and
I
need
but
one
pardon
,
that
of
my
conscience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
,
a
door
at
the
other
end
of
the
drawing-room
opened
*NL*
gently
half
way
,
and
in
the
opening
Cosette
's
head
appeared
.
They
saw
*NL*
only
her
sweet
face
,
her
hair
was
in
charming
disorder
,
her
eyelids
were
*NL*
still
swollen
with
sleep
.
She
made
the
movement
of
a
bird
,
which
thrusts
*NL*
its
head
out
of
its
nest
,
glanced
first
at
her
husband
,
then
at
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
,
and
cried
to
them
with
a
smile
,
so
that
they
seemed
to
behold
a
*NL*
smile
at
the
heart
of
a
rose
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
wager
that
you
are
talking
politics
.
How
stupid
that
is
,
instead
*NL*
of
being
with
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
...
''
stammered
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
paused
.
One
would
have
said
that
they
were
two
criminals
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
who
was
radiant
,
continued
to
gaze
at
both
of
them
.
There
was
*NL*
something
in
her
eyes
like
gleams
of
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
caught
you
in
the
very
act
,
''
said
Cosette
.
``
Just
now
,
I
heard
my
*NL*
father
Fauchelevent
through
the
door
saying
:
`
Conscience
...
doing
my
*NL*
duty
...
'
That
is
politics
,
indeed
it
is
.
I
will
not
have
it
.
People
*NL*
should
not
talk
politics
the
very
next
day
.
It
is
not
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
.
Cosette
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
we
are
talking
business
.
We
*NL*
are
discussing
the
best
investment
of
your
six
hundred
thousand
*NL*
francs
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
it
at
all
,
''
interrupted
Cosette
.
``
I
am
coming
.
Does
any
*NL*
body
want
me
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
passing
resolutely
through
the
door
,
she
entered
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
She
was
dressed
in
a
voluminous
white
dressing-gown
,
with
a
thousand
*NL*
folds
and
large
sleeves
which
,
starting
from
the
neck
,
fell
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
In
the
golden
heavens
of
some
ancient
gothic
pictures
,
there
are
these
*NL*
charming
sacks
fit
to
clothe
the
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
contemplated
herself
from
head
to
foot
in
a
long
mirror
,
then
*NL*
exclaimed
,
in
an
outburst
of
ineffable
ecstasy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
once
a
King
and
a
Queen
.
Oh
!
how
happy
I
am
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
said
,
she
made
a
curtsey
to
Marius
and
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
going
to
install
myself
near
you
in
an
*NL*
easy-chair

breakfast
in
half
an
hour

you
shall
say
anything
you
*NL*
like

I
know
well
that
men
must
talk
,
and
I
will
be
very
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
took
her
by
the
arm
and
said
lovingly
to
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
talking
business

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way

''
said
Cosette
,
``
I
have
opened
my
window

pierrots

arrived

*NL*

*NL*

You

No

*NL*
``
You

*NL*
``
Impossible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good

''
said
Cosette
.
``
I
was
going
to
tell
you
some
news

I
could
*NL*
have
told
you
that
your

still
asleep

that
your

is
*NL*
at
mass

that
the
chimney
in
my

smokes
,
that
*NL*
Nicolette
has
sent
for
the
chimney-sweep

that
Toussaint

Nicolette

Well

Ah

it

you
shall

see

gentlemen

that
I

in

can
say

It

Then
who
*NL*
will
be
caught
?
I
beseech
you

my
little
Marius

let
me
stay
here
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

am
I
anybody

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
not
uttered
a
single
word
.
Cosette
turned
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
father
,
I
want
you
to
come
and
embrace
me

What
do

you
mean
by
not
saying
anything
instead
of
taking
my
part
?
who
gave
me
*NL*
such
a
father
as
that
?
You
must
perceive
that
my
family
life
is
very
*NL*
unhappy
.
My
husband
beats
me
.
Come
,
embrace
me
instantly

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
turned
toward
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
you
,
I
shall
make
a
face
at
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
presented
her
brow
to
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
advanced
a
step
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
recoiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
you
are
pale
.
Does
your
arm
hurt
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

well

said
Jean
Valjean

*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you

badly

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``
Embrace

I

not
scold
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
again
she
offered
him
her
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
dropped
a
kiss
upon
that
brow
whereon
rested
a
celestial
*NL*
gleam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smile
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
obeyed
.
It
was
the
smile
of
a
spectre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

defend
me
against
my
husband

*NL*
*NL*
``

ejaculated
Marius

*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
angry

Say

You
can
certainly
talk

you
think
me
very
silly

What
you
say
is
astonishing
!
business
,
*NL*
placing
money
in
a
bank
a
great
matter
truly
.
Men
make
mysteries
out
of
*NL*
nothing

I
am
very
pretty
this
morning
.
Look
at
me
,
Marius
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
an
adorable
shrug
of
the
shoulders
,
and
an
indescribably
*NL*
exquisite
pout
,
she
glanced
at
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
you
!
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
adore
you
!
''
said
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
they
fell
irresistibly
into
each
other
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Cosette
,
adjusting
a
fold
of
her
dressing-gown
,
with
a
*NL*
triumphant
little
grimace
,
``
I
shall
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
,
''
said
Marius
,
in
a
supplicating
tone
.
``
We
have
to
finish
*NL*
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
no
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
assumed
a
grave
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
assure
you
,
Cosette
,
that
it
is
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
put
on
your
man
's
voice
,
sir
.
That
is
well
,
I
go
.
You
,
father
,
*NL*
have
not
upheld
me
.
Monsieur
my
father
,
monsieur
my
husband
,
you
are
*NL*
tyrants
.
I
shall
go
and
tell
grandpapa
.
If
you
think
that
I
am
going
to
*NL*
return
and
talk
platitudes
to
you
,
you
are
mistaken
.
I
am
proud
.
I
shall
*NL*
wait
for
you
now
.
You
shall
see
,
that
it
is
you
who
are
going
to
be
*NL*
bored
without
me
.
I
am
going
,
it
is
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
left
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
seconds
later
,
the
door
opened
once
more
,
her
fresh
and
rosy
head
*NL*
was
again
thrust
between
the
two
leaves
,
and
she
cried
to
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
angry
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
closed
again
,
and
the
shadows
descended
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
though
a
ray
of
sunlight
should
have
suddenly
traversed
the
*NL*
night
,
without
itself
being
conscious
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
made
sure
that
the
door
was
securely
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Cosette
!
''
he
murmured
,
``
when
she
finds
out
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
word
Jean
Valjean
trembled
in
every
limb
.
He
fixed
on
Marius
a
*NL*
bewildered
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
oh
yes
,
it
is
true
,
you
are
going
to
tell
Cosette
about
this
.
*NL*
That
is
right
.
Stay
,
I
had
not
thought
of
that
.
One
has
the
strength
for
*NL*
one
thing
,
but
not
for
another
.
Sir
,
I
conjure
you
,
I
entreat
now
,
sir
,
*NL*
give
me
your
most
sacred
word
of
honor
,
that
you
will
not
tell
her
.
Is
*NL*
it
not
enough
that
you
should
know
it
?
I
have
been
able
to
say
it
myself
*NL*
without
being
forced
to
it
,
I
could
have
told
it
to
the
universe
,
to
the
*NL*
whole
world
,
--
it
was
all
one
to
me
.
But
she
,
she
does
not
know
what
*NL*
it
is
,
it
would
terrify
her
.
What
,
a
convict
!
we
should
be
obliged
to
*NL*
explain
matters
to
her
,
to
say
to
her
:
`
He
is
a
man
who
has
been
in
the
*NL*
galleys
.
'
She
saw
the
chain-gang
pass
by
one
day
.
Oh
!
My
God
!
''
...
He
*NL*
dropped
into
an
arm-chair
and
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
grief
was
not
audible
,
but
from
the
quivering
of
his
shoulders
it
*NL*
was
evident
that
he
was
weeping
.
Silent
tears
,
terrible
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
something
of
suffocation
in
the
sob
.
He
was
seized
with
a
sort
*NL*
of
convulsion
,
he
threw
himself
against
the
back
of
the
chair
as
though
*NL*
to
gain
breath
,
letting
his
arms
fall
,
and
allowing
Marius
to
see
his
*NL*
face
inundated
with
tears
,
and
Marius
heard
him
murmur
,
so
low
that
his
*NL*
voice
seemed
to
issue
from
fathomless
depths
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
would
that
I
could
die
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
at
your
ease
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
I
will
keep
your
secret
for
myself
*NL*
alone
.
''
And
,
less
touched
,
perhaps
,
than
he
ought
to
have
been
,
but
*NL*
forced
,
for
the
last
hour
,
to
familiarize
himself
with
something
*NL*
as
unexpected
as
it
was
dreadful
,
gradually
beholding
the
convict
*NL*
superposed
before
his
very
eyes
,
upon
M.
Fauchelevent
,
overcome
,
*NL*
little
by
little
,
by
that
lugubrious
reality
,
and
led
,
by
the
natural
*NL*
inclination
of
the
situation
,
to
recognize
the
space
which
had
just
been
*NL*
placed
between
that
man
and
himself
,
Marius
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
that
I
should
not
speak
a
word
to
you
with
regard
to
*NL*
the
deposit
which
you
have
so
faithfully
and
honestly
remitted
.
That
is
*NL*
an
act
of
probity
.
It
is
just
that
some
recompense
should
be
bestowed
on
*NL*
you
.
Fix
the
sum
yourself
,
it
shall
be
counted
out
to
you
.
Do
not
fear
*NL*
to
set
it
very
high
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
sir
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
,
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
in
thought
for
a
moment
,
mechanically
passing
the
tip
of
his
*NL*
fore-finger
across
his
thumb-nail
,
then
he
lifted
up
his
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
is
nearly
over
.
But
one
last
thing
remains
for
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
struggled
with
what
seemed
a
last
hesitation
,
and
,
without
*NL*
voice
,
without
breath
,
he
stammered
rather
than
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
that
you
know
,
do
you
think
,
sir
,
you
,
who
are
the
master
,
that
I
*NL*
ought
not
to
see
Cosette
any
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
would
be
better
,
''
replied
Marius
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
see
her
more
,
''
murmured
Jean
Valjean
.
And
he
directed
his
*NL*
steps
towards
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laid
his
hand
on
the
knob
,
the
latch
yielded
,
the
door
opened
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
pushed
it
open
far
enough
to
pass
through
,
stood
motionless
for
*NL*
a
second
,
then
closed
the
door
again
and
turned
to
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
no
longer
pale
,
he
was
livid
.
There
were
no
longer
any
tears
*NL*
in
his
eyes
,
but
only
a
sort
of
tragic
flame
.
His
voice
had
regained
a
*NL*
strange
composure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
,
sir
,
''
he
said
.
``
If
you
will
allow
it
,
I
will
come
to
see
her
.
I
*NL*
assure
you
that
I
desire
it
greatly
.
If
I
had
not
cared
to
see
Cosette
,
*NL*
I
should
not
have
made
to
you
the
confession
that
I
have
made
,
I
should
*NL*
have
gone
away
;
but
,
as
I
desired
to
remain
in
the
place
where
Cosette
*NL*
is
,
and
to
continue
to
see
her
,
I
had
to
tell
you
about
it
honestly
.
You
*NL*
follow
my
reasoning
,
do
you
not
?
it
is
a
matter
easily
understood
.
You
*NL*
see
,
I
have
had
her
with
me
for
more
than
nine
years
.
We
lived
first
*NL*
in
that
hut
on
the
boulevard
,
then
in
the
convent
,
then
near
the
*NL*
Luxembourg
.
That
was
where
you
saw
her
for
the
first
time
.
You
remember
*NL*
her
blue
plush
hat
.
Then
we
went
to
the
Quartier
des
Invalides
,
where
*NL*
there
was
a
railing
on
a
garden
,
the
Rue
Plumet
.
I
lived
in
a
little
*NL*
back
court-yard
,
whence
I
could
hear
her
piano
.
That
was
my
life
.
We
*NL*
never
left
each
other
.
That
lasted
for
nine
years
and
some
months
.
I
*NL*
was
like
her
own
father
,
and
she
was
my
child
.
I
do
not
know
whether
*NL*
you
understand
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
but
to
go
away
now
,
never
to
see
her
*NL*
again
,
never
to
speak
to
her
again
,
to
no
longer
have
anything
,
would
*NL*
be
hard
.
If
you
do
not
disapprove
of
it
,
I
will
come
to
see
Cosette
from
*NL*
time
to
time
.
I
will
not
come
often
.
I
will
not
remain
long
.
You
shall
*NL*
give
orders
that
I
am
to
be
received
in
the
little
waiting-room
.
On
the
*NL*
ground
floor
.
I
could
enter
perfectly
well
by
the
back
door
,
but
that
*NL*
might
create
surprise
perhaps
,
and
it
would
be
better
,
I
think
,
for
me
*NL*
to
enter
by
the
usual
door
.
Truly
,
sir
,
I
should
like
to
see
a
little
*NL*
more
of
Cosette
.
As
rarely
as
you
please
.
Put
yourself
in
my
place
,
*NL*
I
have
nothing
left
but
that
.
And
then
,
we
must
be
cautious
.
If
I
*NL*
no
longer
come
at
all
,
it
would
produce
a
bad
effect
,
it
would
be
*NL*
considered
singular
.
What
I
can
do
,
by
the
way
,
is
to
come
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
night
is
beginning
to
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shall
come
every
evening
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
and
Cosette
will
be
*NL*
waiting
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
kind
,
sir
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
saluted
Jean
Valjean
,
happiness
escorted
despair
to
the
door
,
and
*NL*
these
two
men
parted
.

CHAPTER
II
--
THE
OBSCURITIES
WHICH
A
REVELATION
CAN
CONTAIN
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
quite
upset
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sort
of
estrangement
which
he
had
always
felt
towards
the
man
beside
*NL*
whom
he
had
seen
Cosette
,
was
now
explained
to
him
.
There
was
something
*NL*
enigmatic
about
that
person
,
of
which
his
instinct
had
warned
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
enigma
was
the
most
hideous
of
disgraces
,
the
galleys
.
This
M.
*NL*
Fauchelevent
was
the
convict
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
abruptly
find
such
a
secret
in
the
midst
of
one
's
happiness
resembles
*NL*
the
discovery
of
a
scorpion
in
a
nest
of
turtledoves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
the
happiness
of
Marius
and
Cosette
thenceforth
condemned
to
such
a
*NL*
neighborhood
?
Was
this
an
accomplished
fact
?
Did
the
acceptance
of
that
*NL*
man
form
a
part
of
the
marriage
now
consummated
?
Was
there
nothing
to
be
*NL*
done
?
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Marius
wedded
the
convict
as
well
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
may
one
be
crowned
with
light
and
joy
,
in
vain
may
one
taste
the
*NL*
grand
purple
hour
of
life
,
happy
love
,
such
shocks
would
force
even
the
*NL*
archangel
in
his
ecstasy
,
even
the
demigod
in
his
glory
,
to
shudder
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
is
always
the
case
in
changes
of
view
of
this
nature
,
Marius
asked
*NL*
himself
whether
he
had
nothing
with
which
to
reproach
himself
.
Had
he
*NL*
been
wanting
in
divination
?
Had
he
been
wanting
in
prudence
?
Had
he
*NL*
involuntarily
dulled
his
wits
?
A
little
,
perhaps
.
Had
he
entered
upon
*NL*
this
love
affair
,
which
had
ended
in
his
marriage
to
Cosette
,
without
*NL*
taking
sufficient
precautions
to
throw
light
upon
the
surroundings
?
He
*NL*
admitted
,
--
it
is
thus
,
by
a
series
of
successive
admissions
of
ourselves
*NL*
in
regard
to
ourselves
,
that
life
amends
us
,
little
by
little
,
--
he
*NL*
admitted
the
chimerical
and
visionary
side
of
his
nature
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
internal
cloud
peculiar
to
many
organizations
,
and
which
,
in
paroxysms
*NL*
of
passion
and
sorrow
,
dilates
as
the
temperature
of
the
soul
changes
,
*NL*
and
invades
the
entire
man
,
to
such
a
degree
as
to
render
him
nothing
*NL*
more
than
a
conscience
bathed
in
a
mist
.
We
have
more
than
once
*NL*
indicated
this
characteristic
element
of
Marius
'
individuality
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
recalled
that
,
in
the
intoxication
of
his
love
,
in
the
Rue
Plumet
,
*NL*
during
those
six
or
seven
ecstatic
weeks
,
he
had
not
even
spoke
to
*NL*
Cosette
of
that
drama
in
the
Gorbeau
hovel
,
where
the
victim
had
taken
*NL*
up
such
a
singular
line
of
silence
during
the
struggle
and
the
ensuing
*NL*
flight
.
How
had
it
happened
that
he
had
not
mentioned
this
to
Cosette
?
*NL*
Yet
it
was
so
near
and
so
terrible
!
How
had
it
come
to
pass
that
he
had
*NL*
not
even
named
the
Thenardiers
,
and
,
particularly
,
on
the
day
when
he
*NL*
had
encountered
Eponine
?
He
now
found
it
almost
difficult
to
explain
his
*NL*
silence
of
that
time
.
Nevertheless
,
he
could
account
for
it
.
He
recalled
*NL*
his
benumbed
state
,
his
intoxication
with
Cosette
,
love
absorbing
*NL*
everything
,
that
catching
away
of
each
other
into
the
ideal
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
also
,
like
the
imperceptible
quantity
of
reason
mingled
with
this
*NL*
violent
and
charming
state
of
the
soul
,
a
vague
,
dull
instinct
impelling
*NL*
him
to
conceal
and
abolish
in
his
memory
that
redoubtable
adventure
,
*NL*
contact
with
which
he
dreaded
,
in
which
he
did
not
wish
to
play
any
*NL*
part
,
his
agency
in
which
he
had
kept
secret
,
and
in
which
he
could
be
*NL*
neither
narrator
nor
witness
without
being
an
accuser
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
these
few
weeks
had
been
a
flash
of
lightning
;
there
had
been
*NL*
no
time
for
anything
except
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
having
weighed
everything
,
turned
everything
over
in
his
mind
,
*NL*
examined
everything
,
whatever
might
have
been
the
consequences
if
he
had
*NL*
told
Cosette
about
the
Gorbeau
ambush
,
even
if
he
had
discovered
that
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
a
convict
,
would
that
have
changed
him
,
Marius
?
Would
*NL*
that
have
changed
her
,
Cosette
?
Would
he
have
drawn
back
?
Would
he
have
*NL*
adored
her
any
the
less
?
Would
he
have
refrained
from
marrying
her
?
No
.
*NL*
Then
there
was
nothing
to
regret
,
nothing
with
which
he
need
reproach
*NL*
himself
.
All
was
well
.
There
is
a
deity
for
those
drunken
men
who
are
*NL*
called
lovers
.
Marius
blind
,
had
followed
the
path
which
he
would
have
*NL*
chosen
had
he
been
in
full
possession
of
his
sight
.
Love
had
bandaged
*NL*
his
eyes
,
in
order
to
lead
him
whither
?
To
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
paradise
was
henceforth
complicated
with
an
infernal
*NL*
accompaniment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
ancient
estrangement
towards
this
man
,
towards
this
Fauchelevent
*NL*
who
had
turned
into
Jean
Valjean
,
was
at
present
mingled
with
horror
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
horror
,
let
us
state
,
there
was
some
pity
,
and
even
a
certain
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
thief
,
this
thief
guilty
of
a
second
offence
,
had
restored
that
*NL*
deposit
.
And
what
a
deposit
!
Six
hundred
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
alone
was
in
the
secret
of
that
deposit
.
He
might
have
kept
it
all
,
*NL*
he
had
restored
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
he
had
himself
revealed
his
situation
.
Nothing
forced
him
to
*NL*
this
.
If
any
one
learned
who
he
was
,
it
was
through
himself
.
In
this
*NL*
avowal
there
was
something
more
than
acceptance
of
humiliation
,
there
*NL*
was
acceptance
of
peril
.
For
a
condemned
man
,
a
mask
is
not
a
mask
,
it
*NL*
is
a
shelter
.
A
false
name
is
security
,
and
he
had
rejected
that
false
*NL*
name
.
He
,
the
galley-slave
,
might
have
hidden
himself
forever
in
an
*NL*
honest
family
;
he
had
withstood
this
temptation
.
And
with
what
motive
?
*NL*
Through
a
conscientious
scruple
.
He
himself
explained
this
with
the
*NL*
irresistible
accents
of
truth
.
In
short
,
whatever
this
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
might
be
,
he
was
,
undoubtedly
,
a
conscience
which
was
awakening
.
There
*NL*
existed
some
mysterious
re-habilitation
which
had
begun
;
and
,
to
all
*NL*
appearances
,
scruples
had
for
a
long
time
already
controlled
this
man
.
*NL*
Such
fits
of
justice
and
goodness
are
not
characteristic
of
vulgar
*NL*
natures
.
An
awakening
of
conscience
is
grandeur
of
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
sincere
.
This
sincerity
,
visible
,
palpable
,
*NL*
irrefragable
,
evident
from
the
very
grief
that
it
caused
him
,
rendered
*NL*
inquiries
useless
,
and
conferred
authority
on
all
that
that
man
had
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
for
Marius
,
there
was
a
strange
reversal
of
situations
.
What
*NL*
breathed
from
M.
Fauchelevent
?
distrust
.
What
did
Jean
Valjean
inspire
?
*NL*
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mysterious
balance
of
this
Jean
Valjean
which
the
pensive
Marius
*NL*
struck
,
he
admitted
the
active
principle
,
he
admitted
the
passive
*NL*
principle
,
and
he
tried
to
reach
a
balance
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
all
this
went
on
as
in
a
storm
.
Marius
,
while
endeavoring
to
form
a
*NL*
clear
idea
of
this
man
,
and
while
pursuing
Jean
Valjean
,
so
to
speak
,
in
*NL*
the
depths
of
his
thought
,
lost
him
and
found
him
again
in
a
fatal
mist
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
deposit
honestly
restored
,
the
probity
of
the
confession
--
these
were
*NL*
good
.
This
produced
a
lightening
of
the
cloud
,
then
the
cloud
became
*NL*
black
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troubled
as
were
Marius
'
memories
,
a
shadow
of
them
returned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
what
was
that
adventure
in
the
Jondrette
attic
?
Why
had
that
*NL*
man
taken
to
flight
on
the
arrival
of
the
police
,
instead
of
entering
a
*NL*
complaint
?
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Marius
found
the
answer
.
Because
that
man
was
a
fugitive
from
*NL*
justice
,
who
had
broken
his
ban
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
question
:
Why
had
that
man
come
to
the
barricade
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
Marius
now
once
more
distinctly
beheld
that
recollection
which
had
*NL*
re-appeared
in
his
emotions
like
sympathetic
ink
at
the
application
of
*NL*
heat
.
This
man
had
been
in
the
barricade
.
He
had
not
fought
there
.
What
*NL*
had
he
come
there
for
?
In
the
presence
of
this
question
a
spectre
sprang
*NL*
up
and
replied
:
``
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
recalled
perfectly
now
that
funereal
sight
of
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
dragging
the
pinioned
Javert
out
of
the
barricade
,
and
he
still
heard
*NL*
behind
the
corner
of
the
little
Rue
Mondetour
that
frightful
pistol
*NL*
shot
.
Obviously
,
there
was
hatred
between
that
police
spy
and
the
*NL*
galley-slave
.
The
one
was
in
the
other
's
way
.
Jean
Valjean
had
gone
to
*NL*
the
barricade
for
the
purpose
of
revenging
himself
.
He
had
arrived
late
.
*NL*
He
probably
knew
that
Javert
was
a
prisoner
there
.
The
Corsican
vendetta
*NL*
has
penetrated
to
certain
lower
strata
and
has
become
the
law
there
;
it
*NL*
is
so
simple
that
it
does
not
astonish
souls
which
are
but
half
turned
*NL*
towards
good
;
and
those
hearts
are
so
constituted
that
a
criminal
,
who
*NL*
is
in
the
path
of
repentance
,
may
be
scrupulous
in
the
matter
of
theft
*NL*
and
unscrupulous
in
the
matter
of
vengeance
.
Jean
Valjean
had
killed
*NL*
Javert
.
At
least
,
that
seemed
to
be
evident
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
final
question
,
to
be
sure
;
but
to
this
there
was
no
reply
.
*NL*
This
question
Marius
felt
like
pincers
.
How
had
it
come
to
pass
that
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
existence
had
elbowed
that
of
Cosette
for
so
long
a
*NL*
period
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
melancholy
sport
of
Providence
was
that
which
had
placed
that
child
*NL*
in
contact
with
that
man
?
Are
there
then
chains
for
two
which
are
forged
*NL*
on
high
?
and
does
God
take
pleasure
in
coupling
the
angel
with
the
*NL*
demon
?
So
a
crime
and
an
innocence
can
be
room-mates
in
the
mysterious
*NL*
galleys
of
wretchedness
?
In
that
defiling
of
condemned
persons
which
*NL*
is
called
human
destiny
,
can
two
brows
pass
side
by
side
,
the
one
*NL*
ingenuous
,
the
other
formidable
,
the
one
all
bathed
in
the
divine
*NL*
whiteness
of
dawn
,
the
other
forever
blemished
by
the
flash
of
an
*NL*
eternal
lightning
?
Who
could
have
arranged
that
inexplicable
pairing
*NL*
off
?
In
what
manner
,
in
consequence
of
what
prodigy
,
had
any
community
*NL*
of
life
been
established
between
this
celestial
little
creature
and
that
*NL*
old
criminal
?
*NL*
*NL*
Who
could
have
bound
the
lamb
to
the
wolf
,
and
,
what
was
still
more
*NL*
incomprehensible
,
have
attached
the
wolf
to
the
lamb
?
For
the
wolf
loved
*NL*
the
lamb
,
for
the
fierce
creature
adored
the
feeble
one
,
for
,
during
*NL*
the
space
of
nine
years
,
the
angel
had
had
the
monster
as
her
point
of
*NL*
support
.
Cosette
's
childhood
and
girlhood
,
her
advent
in
the
daylight
,
*NL*
her
virginal
growth
towards
life
and
light
,
had
been
sheltered
by
*NL*
that
hideous
devotion
.
Here
questions
exfoliated
,
so
to
speak
,
into
*NL*
innumerable
enigmas
,
abysses
yawned
at
the
bottoms
of
abysses
,
and
*NL*
Marius
could
no
longer
bend
over
Jean
Valjean
without
becoming
dizzy
.
*NL*
What
was
this
man-precipice
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
symbols
of
Genesis
are
eternal
;
in
human
society
,
such
as
it
now
*NL*
exists
,
and
until
a
broader
day
shall
effect
a
change
in
it
,
there
will
*NL*
always
be
two
men
,
the
one
superior
,
the
other
subterranean
;
the
one
*NL*
which
is
according
to
good
is
Abel
;
the
other
which
is
according
to
evil
*NL*
is
Cain
.
What
was
this
tender
Cain
?
What
was
this
ruffian
religiously
*NL*
absorbed
in
the
adoration
of
a
virgin
,
watching
over
her
,
rearing
her
,
*NL*
guarding
her
,
dignifying
her
,
and
enveloping
her
,
impure
as
he
was
*NL*
himself
,
with
purity
?
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
that
cess-pool
which
had
venerated
that
innocence
to
such
a
*NL*
point
as
not
to
leave
upon
it
a
single
spot
?
What
was
this
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
educating
Cosette
?
What
was
this
figure
of
the
shadows
which
had
for
its
*NL*
only
object
the
preservation
of
the
rising
of
a
star
from
every
shadow
*NL*
and
from
every
cloud
?
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
Jean
Valjean
's
secret
;
that
was
also
God
's
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
presence
of
this
double
secret
,
Marius
recoiled
.
The
one
,
in
some
*NL*
sort
,
reassured
him
as
to
the
other
.
God
was
as
visible
in
this
affair
*NL*
as
was
Jean
Valjean
.
God
has
his
instruments
.
He
makes
use
of
the
tool
*NL*
which
he
wills
.
He
is
not
responsible
to
men
.
Do
we
know
how
God
sets
*NL*
about
the
work
?
Jean
Valjean
had
labored
over
Cosette
.
He
had
,
to
some
*NL*
extent
,
made
that
soul
.
That
was
incontestable
.
Well
,
what
then
?
The
*NL*
workman
was
horrible
;
but
the
work
was
admirable
.
God
produces
his
*NL*
miracles
as
seems
good
to
him
.
He
had
constructed
that
charming
Cosette
,
*NL*
and
he
had
employed
Jean
Valjean
.
It
had
pleased
him
to
choose
this
*NL*
strange
collaborator
for
himself
.
What
account
have
we
to
demand
of
him
?
*NL*
Is
this
the
first
time
that
the
dung-heap
has
aided
the
spring
to
create
*NL*
the
rose
?
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
made
himself
these
replies
,
and
declared
to
himself
that
they
*NL*
were
good
.
He
had
not
dared
to
press
Jean
Valjean
on
all
the
points
*NL*
which
we
have
just
indicated
,
but
he
did
not
confess
to
himself
that
he
*NL*
did
not
dare
to
do
it
.
He
adored
Cosette
,
he
possessed
Cosette
,
Cosette
*NL*
was
splendidly
pure
.
That
was
sufficient
for
him
.
What
enlightenment
did
*NL*
he
need
?
Cosette
was
a
light
.
Does
light
require
enlightenment
?
He
had
*NL*
everything
;
what
more
could
he
desire
?
All
,
--
is
not
that
enough
?
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
personal
affairs
did
not
concern
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
bending
over
the
fatal
shadow
of
that
man
,
he
clung
fast
,
*NL*
convulsively
,
to
the
solemn
declaration
of
that
unhappy
wretch
:
``
I
*NL*
am
nothing
to
Cosette
.
Ten
years
ago
I
did
not
know
that
she
was
in
*NL*
existence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
a
passer-by
.
He
had
said
so
himself
.
Well
,
he
had
*NL*
passed
.
Whatever
he
was
,
his
part
was
finished
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henceforth
,
there
remained
Marius
to
fulfil
the
part
of
Providence
to
*NL*
Cosette
.
Cosette
had
sought
the
azure
in
a
person
like
herself
,
in
her
*NL*
lover
,
her
husband
,
her
celestial
male
.
Cosette
,
as
she
took
her
flight
,
*NL*
winged
and
transfigured
,
left
behind
her
on
the
earth
her
hideous
and
*NL*
empty
chrysalis
,
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
whatever
circle
of
ideas
Marius
revolved
,
he
always
returned
to
a
*NL*
certain
horror
for
Jean
Valjean
.
A
sacred
horror
,
perhaps
,
for
,
as
we
*NL*
have
just
pointed
out
,
he
felt
a
quid
divinum
in
that
man
.
But
do
what
*NL*
he
would
,
and
seek
what
extenuation
he
would
,
he
was
certainly
forced
to
*NL*
fall
back
upon
this
:
the
man
was
a
convict
;
that
is
to
say
,
a
being
who
*NL*
has
not
even
a
place
in
the
social
ladder
,
since
he
is
lower
than
the
*NL*
very
lowest
rung
.
After
the
very
last
of
men
comes
the
convict
.
The
*NL*
convict
is
no
longer
,
so
to
speak
,
in
the
semblance
of
the
living
.
The
*NL*
law
has
deprived
him
of
the
entire
quantity
of
humanity
of
which
it
can
*NL*
deprive
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
on
penal
questions
,
still
held
to
the
inexorable
system
,
though
*NL*
he
was
a
democrat
and
he
entertained
all
the
ideas
of
the
law
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
those
whom
the
law
strikes
.
He
had
not
yet
accomplished
all
*NL*
progress
,
we
admit
.
He
had
not
yet
come
to
distinguish
between
that
*NL*
which
is
written
by
man
and
that
which
is
written
by
God
,
between
law
*NL*
and
right
.
He
had
not
examined
and
weighed
the
right
which
man
takes
to
*NL*
dispose
of
the
irrevocable
and
the
irreparable
.
He
was
not
shocked
by
*NL*
the
word
vindicte
.
He
found
it
quite
simple
that
certain
breaches
of
the
*NL*
written
law
should
be
followed
by
eternal
suffering
,
and
he
accepted
,
*NL*
as
the
process
of
civilization
,
social
damnation
.
He
still
stood
at
this
*NL*
point
,
though
safe
to
advance
infallibly
later
on
,
since
his
nature
was
*NL*
good
,
and
,
at
bottom
,
wholly
formed
of
latent
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
stage
of
his
ideas
,
Jean
Valjean
appeared
to
him
hideous
and
*NL*
repulsive
.
He
was
a
man
reproved
,
he
was
the
convict
.
That
word
was
*NL*
for
him
like
the
sound
of
the
trump
on
the
Day
of
Judgment
;
and
,
after
*NL*
having
reflected
upon
Jean
Valjean
for
a
long
time
,
his
final
gesture
*NL*
had
been
to
turn
away
his
head
.
Vade
retro
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
if
we
must
recognize
and
even
insist
upon
the
fact
,
while
*NL*
interrogating
Jean
Valjean
to
such
a
point
that
Jean
Valjean
had
said
:
*NL*
``
You
are
confessing
me
,
''
had
not
,
nevertheless
,
put
to
him
two
or
three
*NL*
decisive
questions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
that
they
had
not
presented
themselves
to
his
mind
,
but
that
*NL*
he
had
been
afraid
of
them
.
The
Jondrette
attic
?
The
barricade
?
Javert
?
*NL*
Who
knows
where
these
revelations
would
have
stopped
?
Jean
Valjean
did
*NL*
not
seem
like
a
man
who
would
draw
back
,
and
who
knows
whether
Marius
,
*NL*
after
having
urged
him
on
,
would
not
have
himself
desired
to
hold
him
*NL*
back
?
*NL*
*NL*
Has
it
not
happened
to
all
of
us
,
in
certain
supreme
conjunctures
,
to
*NL*
stop
our
ears
in
order
that
we
may
not
hear
the
reply
,
after
we
have
*NL*
asked
a
question
?
It
is
especially
when
one
loves
that
one
gives
way
*NL*
to
these
exhibitions
of
cowardice
.
It
is
not
wise
to
question
sinister
*NL*
situations
to
the
last
point
,
particularly
when
the
indissoluble
side
of
*NL*
our
life
is
fatally
intermingled
with
them
.
What
a
terrible
light
might
*NL*
have
proceeded
from
the
despairing
explanations
of
Jean
Valjean
,
and
who
*NL*
knows
whether
that
hideous
glare
would
not
have
darted
forth
as
far
*NL*
as
Cosette
?
Who
knows
whether
a
sort
of
infernal
glow
would
not
have
*NL*
lingered
behind
it
on
the
brow
of
that
angel
?
The
spattering
of
a
*NL*
lightning-flash
is
of
the
thunder
also
.
Fatality
has
points
of
juncture
*NL*
where
innocence
itself
is
stamped
with
crime
by
the
gloomy
law
of
the
*NL*
reflections
which
give
color
.
The
purest
figures
may
forever
preserve
*NL*
the
reflection
of
a
horrible
association
.
Rightly
or
wrongly
,
Marius
*NL*
had
been
afraid
.
He
already
knew
too
much
.
He
sought
to
dull
his
senses
*NL*
rather
than
to
gain
further
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
dismay
he
bore
off
Cosette
in
his
arms
and
shut
his
eyes
to
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
man
was
the
night
,
the
living
and
horrible
night
.
How
should
he
*NL*
dare
to
seek
the
bottom
of
it
?
It
is
a
terrible
thing
to
interrogate
*NL*
the
shadow
.
Who
knows
what
its
reply
will
be
?
The
dawn
may
be
blackened
*NL*
forever
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
state
of
mind
the
thought
that
that
man
would
,
henceforth
,
come
*NL*
into
any
contact
whatever
with
Cosette
was
a
heartrending
perplexity
to
*NL*
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
almost
reproached
himself
for
not
having
put
those
formidable
*NL*
questions
,
before
which
he
had
recoiled
,
and
from
which
an
implacable
*NL*
and
definitive
decision
might
have
sprung
.
He
felt
that
he
was
too
good
,
*NL*
too
gentle
,
too
weak
,
if
we
must
say
the
word
.
This
weakness
had
led
him
*NL*
to
an
imprudent
concession
.
He
had
allowed
himself
to
be
touched
.
He
*NL*
had
been
in
the
wrong
.
He
ought
to
have
simply
and
purely
rejected
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
Jean
Valjean
played
the
part
of
fire
,
and
that
is
what
he
*NL*
should
have
done
,
and
have
freed
his
house
from
that
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
vexed
with
himself
,
he
was
angry
with
that
whirlwind
of
emotions
*NL*
which
had
deafened
,
blinded
,
and
carried
him
away
.
He
was
displeased
*NL*
with
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
was
he
to
do
now
?
Jean
Valjean
's
visits
were
profoundly
repugnant
*NL*
to
him
.
What
was
the
use
in
having
that
man
in
his
house
?
What
did
the
*NL*
man
want
?
Here
,
he
became
dismayed
,
he
did
not
wish
to
dig
down
,
he
did
*NL*
not
wish
to
penetrate
deeply
;
he
did
not
wish
to
sound
himself
.
He
*NL*
had
promised
,
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
a
promise
;
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
held
his
promise
;
one
must
keep
one
's
word
even
to
a
convict
,
*NL*
above
all
to
a
convict
.
Still
,
his
first
duty
was
to
Cosette
.
In
short
,
*NL*
he
was
carried
away
by
the
repugnance
which
dominated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
turned
over
all
this
confusion
of
ideas
in
his
mind
,
passing
*NL*
from
one
to
the
other
,
and
moved
by
all
of
them
.
Hence
arose
a
profound
*NL*
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
easy
for
him
to
hide
this
trouble
from
Cosette
,
but
love
is
a
*NL*
talent
,
and
Marius
succeeded
in
doing
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
without
any
apparent
object
,
he
questioned
Cosette
,
who
was
as
*NL*
candid
as
a
dove
is
white
and
who
suspected
nothing
;
he
talked
of
her
*NL*
childhood
and
her
youth
,
and
he
became
more
and
more
convinced
that
that
*NL*
convict
had
been
everything
good
,
paternal
and
respectable
that
a
man
*NL*
can
be
towards
Cosette
.
All
that
Marius
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
and
had
*NL*
surmised
was
real
.
That
sinister
nettle
had
loved
and
protected
that
*NL*
lily
.

CHAPTER
I
--
THE
LOWER
CHAMBER
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
at
nightfall
,
Jean
Valjean
knocked
at
the
carriage
*NL*
gate
of
the
Gillenormand
house
.
It
was
Basque
who
received
him
.
Basque
*NL*
was
in
the
courtyard
at
the
appointed
hour
,
as
though
he
had
received
*NL*
his
orders
.
It
sometimes
happens
that
one
says
to
a
servant
:
``
You
will
*NL*
watch
for
Mr.
So
and
So
,
when
he
arrives
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Basque
addressed
Jean
Valjean
without
waiting
for
the
latter
to
approach
*NL*
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
has
charged
me
to
inquire
whether
monsieur
desires
to
*NL*
go
upstairs
or
to
remain
below
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
remain
below
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Basque
,
who
was
perfectly
respectful
,
opened
the
door
of
the
*NL*
waiting-room
and
said
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
and
inform
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
which
Jean
Valjean
entered
was
a
damp
,
vaulted
room
on
the
*NL*
ground
floor
,
which
served
as
a
cellar
on
occasion
,
which
opened
on
the
*NL*
street
,
was
paved
with
red
squares
and
was
badly
lighted
by
a
grated
*NL*
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
chamber
was
not
one
of
those
which
are
harassed
by
the
*NL*
feather-duster
,
the
pope
's
head
brush
,
and
the
broom
.
The
dust
rested
*NL*
tranquilly
there
.
Persecution
of
the
spiders
was
not
organized
there
.
A
*NL*
fine
web
,
which
spread
far
and
wide
,
and
was
very
black
and
ornamented
*NL*
with
dead
flies
,
formed
a
wheel
on
one
of
the
window-panes
.
The
room
,
*NL*
which
was
small
and
low-ceiled
,
was
furnished
with
a
heap
of
empty
*NL*
bottles
piled
up
in
one
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wall
,
which
was
daubed
with
an
ochre
yellow
wash
,
was
scaling
off
in
*NL*
large
flakes
.
At
one
end
there
was
a
chimney-piece
painted
in
black
*NL*
with
a
narrow
shelf
.
A
fire
was
burning
there
;
which
indicated
that
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
's
reply
:
``
I
will
remain
below
,
''
had
been
foreseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
arm-chairs
were
placed
at
the
two
corners
of
the
fireplace
.
Between
*NL*
the
chairs
an
old
bedside
rug
,
which
displayed
more
foundation
thread
*NL*
than
wool
,
had
been
spread
by
way
of
a
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chamber
was
lighted
by
the
fire
on
the
hearth
and
the
twilight
*NL*
falling
through
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
was
fatigued
.
For
days
he
had
neither
eaten
nor
slept
.
He
*NL*
threw
himself
into
one
of
the
arm-chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Basque
returned
,
set
a
lighted
candle
on
the
chimney-piece
and
retired
.
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
his
head
drooping
and
his
chin
resting
on
his
breast
,
*NL*
perceived
neither
Basque
nor
the
candle
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
,
he
drew
himself
up
with
a
start
.
Cosette
was
standing
*NL*
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
not
seen
her
enter
,
but
he
had
felt
that
she
was
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
round
.
He
gazed
at
her
.
She
was
adorably
lovely
.
But
what
he
*NL*
was
contemplating
with
that
profound
gaze
was
not
her
beauty
but
her
*NL*
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
exclaimed
Cosette
,
``
father
,
I
knew
that
you
were
peculiar
,
but
*NL*
I
never
should
have
expected
this
.
What
an
idea
!
Marius
told
me
that
you
*NL*
wish
me
to
receive
you
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
my
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
expected
that
reply
.
Good
.
I
warn
you
that
I
am
going
to
make
a
scene
*NL*
for
you
.
Let
us
begin
at
the
beginning
.
Embrace
me
,
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
offered
him
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
remained
motionless
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
stir
.
I
take
note
of
it
.
Attitude
of
guilt
.
But
never
mind
,
*NL*
I
pardon
you
.
Jesus
Christ
said
:
Offer
the
other
cheek
.
Here
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
presented
her
other
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
did
not
move
.
It
seemed
as
though
his
feet
were
nailed
to
*NL*
the
pavement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
becoming
serious
,
''
said
Cosette
.
``
What
have
I
done
to
you
?
I
*NL*
declare
that
I
am
perplexed

You
owe
me
reparation

You
will
dine
with
*NL*
us
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
dined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not
true

I
will
get
M.
Gillenormand
to
scold
you

reprimand

Come

Go
upstairs
with
me
to
the

drawing-room

Immediately

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Impossible

''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Cosette
lost
ground
a
little
.
She
ceased
to
command
and
passed
to
*NL*
questioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
and
you
choose
the
ugliest
chamber
in
the
house
in
which
to
*NL*
see
me

It
's
horrible
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
knowest
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
caught
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
madame
,
that
I
am
peculiar
,
I
have
my
freaks

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
struck
her
tiny
hands
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Madame
!
...
You
know
!
...
more
novelties
!
What
is
the
meaning
of
*NL*
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
directed
upon
her
that
heartrending
smile
to
which
he
*NL*
occasionally
had
recourse
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wished
to
be
Madame
.
You
are
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
me

`
Jean
,

if
you
like

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
no

I
am
no

Cosette

*NL*
What
does
this
mean
?
why

these

revolutions

are

they

what
has
*NL*
taken
place

in

And

*NL*
And
you
wo

What

I
done
to
you
?
Has
anything

happened
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
as

*NL*
*NL*

Why

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

surely

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
again
with
the
same
smile
as
before
and
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
you
are
Madame
Pontmercy
,
I
certainly
can
be
Monsieur
Jean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
anything
about

All
this

idiotic

ask

I
hope
that
he

not
consent

One
does

have
freaks

one
does
not

one

little
Cosette
grief

That
is
*NL*
wrong

You

no
right

be
wicked
,
you
who
are
so
good

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seized
his
hands
with
vivacity
,
and
raising
them
to
her
face
with
*NL*
an
irresistible
movement
,
she
pressed
them
against
her
neck
beneath
her
*NL*
chin
,
which
is
a
gesture
of
profound
tenderness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
said
to
him
,
``
be
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
what
I
call
being
good

being
nice

coming
and
living

here

here
as
there
are
in
the
Rue
Plumet

living
with

us

quitting
that
hole
of
a
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
not
giving

riddles

being
like
all
the

dining

*NL*
*NL*
He
loosed
her
hands

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
no
longer
need
a
father

you
have
a
husband

*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
became
angry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
no

One
really
does

what
to

things

which
are
not
common
sense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Toussaint
were
here
,
''
resumed
Jean
Valjean
,
like
a
person
who
is
*NL*
driven
to
seek
authorities
,
and
who
clutches
at
every
branch
,
``
she
would
*NL*
be
the
first
to
agree
that
it
is
true
that
I
have
always
had
ways
of
my
*NL*
own
.
There
is
nothing
new
in
this
.
I
always
have
loved
my
black
corner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
cold
here
.
One
can
not
see
distinctly
.
It
is
abominable
,
that
*NL*
it
is

to
wish
to
be
Monsieur
Jean

I
will
not
have
you
say
`
you

to
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
now
,
as
I
was
coming
hither
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
saw
a
piece
*NL*
of
furniture
in
the
Rue
Saint
Louis
.
It
was
at
a
cabinet-maker

If
I
*NL*
were
a
pretty
woman
,
I
would
treat
myself
to
that
bit
of
furniture

A
*NL*
very
neat
toilet
table
in
the
reigning
style
.
What
you
call
rosewood
,
I
*NL*
think
.
It
is
inlaid
.
The
mirror
is
quite
large

There
are
drawers

It
is
*NL*
pretty

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hou
!
the
villainous
bear
!
''
replied
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
supreme
grace
,
setting
her
teeth
and
drawing
back
her
lips
,
she
*NL*
blew
at
Jean
Valjean
.
She
was
a
Grace
copying
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
furious
,
''
she
resumed
.
``
Ever
since
yesterday
,
you
have
made
me
*NL*
rage

all
of
you

I
am
greatly
vexed

I
do
n't
understand
.
You
do
not
*NL*
defend
me
against
Marius
.
Marius
will
not
uphold
me
against
you

I
am
*NL*
all
alone

I
arrange
a
chamber
prettily
.
If
I
could
have
put
the
good
*NL*
God
there
I
would
have
done
it
.
My
chamber
is
left
on
my
hands

My
*NL*
lodger
sends
me
into
bankruptcy

I
order
a
nice
little
dinner
of
*NL*
Nicolette
.
We
will
have
nothing
to
do
with
your
dinner
,
Madame

And
my
*NL*
father
Fauchelevent
wants
me
to
call
him
`
Monsieur
Jean

'
and
to
receive
*NL*
him
in
a
frightful
,
old
,
ugly
cellar
,
where
the
walls
have
beards
,
and
*NL*
where
the
crystal
consists
of
empty
bottles
,
and
the
curtains
are
of
*NL*
spiders

webs
!
You
are
singular
,
I
admit
,
that
is
your
style
,
but
people
*NL*
who
get
married
are
granted
a
truce
.
You
ought
not
to
have
begun
being
*NL*
singular
again
instantly
.
So
you
are
going
to
be
perfectly
contented
in
*NL*
your
abominable
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
.
I
was
very
desperate
indeed
there
,
*NL*
that
I
was
.
What
have
you
against
me
?
You
cause
me
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
grief
.
Fi
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
becoming
suddenly
serious
,
she
gazed
intently
at
Jean
Valjean
and
*NL*
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
angry
with
me
because
I
am
happy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ingenuousness
sometimes
unconsciously
penetrates
deep
.
This
question
,
*NL*
which
was
simple
for
Cosette
,
was
profound
for
Jean
Valjean
.
Cosette
had
*NL*
meant
to
scratch
,
and
she
lacerated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
for
a
moment
without
replying
,
then
,
with
an
inexpressible
*NL*
intonation
,
and
speaking
to
himself
,
he
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
happiness
was
the
object
of
my
life
.
Now
God
may
sign
my
dismissal
.
*NL*
Cosette
,
thou
art
happy
;
my
day
is
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
have
said
thou
to
me
!
''
exclaimed
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
sprang
to
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
in
bewilderment
,
strained
her
wildly
to
his
breast
.
It
*NL*
almost
seemed
to
him
as
though
he
were
taking
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
father
!
''
said
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
enthusiastic
impulse
was
on
the
point
of
becoming
poignant
for
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
He
gently
removed
Cosette
's
arms
,
and
took
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
leave
you
,
Madame
,
they
are
waiting
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
from
the
threshold
,
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
said
thou
to
you
.
Tell
your
husband
that
this
shall
not
happen
*NL*
again
.
Pardon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
quitted
the
room
,
leaving
Cosette
stupefied
at
this
*NL*
enigmatical
farewell
.

CHAPTER
II
--
ANOTHER
STEP
BACKWARDS
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
at
the
same
hour
,
Jean
Valjean
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
asked
him
no
questions
,
was
no
longer
astonished
,
no
longer
*NL*
exclaimed
that
she
was
cold
,
no
longer
spoke
of
the
drawing-room
,
she
*NL*
avoided
saying
either
``
father
''
or
``
Monsieur
Jean
.
''
She
allowed
herself
*NL*
to
be
addressed
as
you
.
She
allowed
herself
to
be
called
Madame
.
Only
,
*NL*
her
joy
had
undergone
a
certain
diminution
.
She
would
have
been
sad
,
if
*NL*
sadness
had
been
possible
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
that
she
had
had
with
Marius
one
of
those
conversations
*NL*
in
which
the
beloved
man
says
what
he
pleases
,
explains
nothing
,
and
*NL*
satisfies
the
beloved
woman
.
The
curiosity
of
lovers
does
not
extend
*NL*
very
far
beyond
their
own
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lower
room
had
made
a
little
toilet
.
Basque
had
suppressed
the
*NL*
bottles
,
and
Nicolette
the
spiders
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
days
which
followed
brought
Jean
Valjean
at
the
same
hour
.
He
*NL*
came
every
day
,
because
he
had
not
the
strength
to
take
Marius
'
words
*NL*
otherwise
than
literally
.
Marius
arranged
matters
so
as
to
be
absent
at
*NL*
the
hours
when
Jean
Valjean
came
.
The
house
grew
accustomed
to
the
novel
*NL*
ways
of
M.
Fauchelevent
.
Toussaint
helped
in
this
direction
:
``
Monsieur
*NL*
has
always
been
like
that
,
''
she
repeated
.
The
grandfather
issued
this
*NL*
decree
:
--
``
He
's
an
original
.
''
And
all
was
said
.
Moreover
,
at
the
age
of
*NL*
ninety-six
,
no
bond
is
any
longer
possible
,
all
is
merely
juxtaposition
;
*NL*
a
newcomer
is
in
the
way
.
There
is
no
longer
any
room
;
all
habits
are
*NL*
acquired
.
M.
Fauchelevent
,
M.
Tranchelevent
,
Father
Gillenormand
*NL*
asked
nothing
better
than
to
be
relieved
from
``
that
gentleman
.
''
He
*NL*
added
:
--
``
Nothing
is
more
common
than
those
originals
.
They
do
all
sorts
*NL*
of
queer
things
.
They
have
no
reason
.
The
Marquis
de
Canaples
was
still
*NL*
worse
.
He
bought
a
palace
that
he
might
lodge
in
the
garret
.
These
are
*NL*
fantastic
appearances
that
people
affect
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
sinister
foundation
.
And
moreover
,
who
*NL*
could
have
guessed
such
a
thing
?
There
are
marshes
of
this
description
*NL*
in
India
.
The
water
seems
extraordinary
,
inexplicable
,
rippling
though
*NL*
there
is
no
wind
,
and
agitated
where
it
should
be
calm
.
One
gazes
at
the
*NL*
surface
of
these
causeless
ebullitions
;
one
does
not
perceive
the
hydra
*NL*
which
crawls
on
the
bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
men
have
a
secret
monster
in
this
same
manner
,
a
dragon
which
gnaws
*NL*
them
,
a
despair
which
inhabits
their
night
.
Such
a
man
resembles
*NL*
other
men
,
he
goes
and
comes
.
No
one
knows
that
he
bears
within
him
a
*NL*
frightful
parasitic
pain
with
a
thousand
teeth
,
which
lives
within
the
*NL*
unhappy
man
,
and
of
which
he
is
dying
.
No
one
knows
that
this
man
is
a
*NL*
gulf
.
He
is
stagnant
but
deep
.
From
time
to
time
,
a
trouble
of
which
*NL*
the
onlooker
understands
nothing
appears
on
his
surface
.
A
mysterious
*NL*
wrinkle
is
formed
,
then
vanishes
,
then
re-appears
;
an
air-bubble
rises
*NL*
and
bursts
.
It
is
the
breathing
of
the
unknown
beast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certain
strange
habits
:
arriving
at
the
hour
when
other
people
are
*NL*
taking
their
leave
,
keeping
in
the
background
when
other
people
*NL*
are
displaying
themselves
,
preserving
on
all
occasions
what
may
be
*NL*
designated
as
the
wall-colored
mantle
,
seeking
the
solitary
walk
,
*NL*
preferring
the
deserted
street
,
avoiding
any
share
in
conversation
,
*NL*
avoiding
crowds
and
festivals
,
seeming
at
one
's
ease
and
living
poorly
,
*NL*
having
one
's
key
in
one
's
pocket
,
and
one
's
candle
at
the
porter
's
*NL*
lodge
,
however
rich
one
may
be
,
entering
by
the
side
door
,
ascending
*NL*
the
private
staircase
,
--
all
these
insignificant
singularities
,
fugitive
*NL*
folds
on
the
surface
,
often
proceed
from
a
formidable
foundation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
weeks
passed
in
this
manner
.
A
new
life
gradually
took
possession
*NL*
of
Cosette
:
the
relations
which
marriage
creates
,
visits
,
the
care
*NL*
of
the
house
,
pleasures
,
great
matters
.
Cosette
's
pleasures
were
not
*NL*
costly
,
they
consisted
in
one
thing
:
being
with
Marius
.
The
great
*NL*
occupation
of
her
life
was
to
go
out
with
him
,
to
remain
with
him
.
It
*NL*
was
for
them
a
joy
that
was
always
fresh
,
to
go
out
arm
in
arm
,
in
the
*NL*
face
of
the
sun
,
in
the
open
street
,
without
hiding
themselves
,
before
*NL*
the
whole
world
,
both
of
them
completely
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
one
vexation
.
Toussaint
could
not
get
on
with
Nicolette
,
the
*NL*
soldering
of
two
elderly
maids
being
impossible
,
and
she
went
away
.
*NL*
The
grandfather
was
well
;
Marius
argued
a
case
here
and
there
;
Aunt
*NL*
Gillenormand
peacefully
led
that
life
aside
which
sufficed
for
her
,
*NL*
beside
the
new
household
.
Jean
Valjean
came
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
address
as
thou
disappeared
,
the
you
,
the
``
Madame
,
''
the
``
Monsieur
*NL*
Jean
,
''
rendered
him
another
person
to
Cosette
.
The
care
which
he
had
*NL*
himself
taken
to
detach
her
from
him
was
succeeding
.
She
became
more
and
*NL*
more
gay
and
less
and
less
tender
.
Yet
she
still
loved
him
sincerely
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
said
to
him
suddenly
:
``
You
used
to
be
my
father
,
you
are
*NL*
no
longer
my
father
,
you
were
my
uncle
,
you
are
no
longer
my
uncle
,
you
*NL*
were
Monsieur
Fauchelevent
,
you
are
Jean
.
Who
are
you
then
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
all
this
.
If
I
did
not
know
how
good
you
are
,
I
should
be
afraid
of
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
lived
in
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
because
he
could
not
make
up
*NL*
his
mind
to
remove
to
a
distance
from
the
quarter
where
Cosette
dwelt
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
,
he
only
remained
a
few
minutes
with
Cosette
,
and
then
went
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
he
acquired
the
habit
of
making
his
visits
less
brief
.
*NL*
One
would
have
said
that
he
was
taking
advantage
of
the
authorization
of
*NL*
the
days
which
were
lengthening
,
he
arrived
earlier
and
departed
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
Cosette
chanced
to
say
``
father
''
to
him
.
A
flash
of
joy
*NL*
illuminated
Jean
Valjean
's
melancholy
old
countenance
.
He
caught
her
*NL*
up
:
``
Say
Jean
.
''
--
``
Ah
!
truly
,
''
she
replied
with
a
burst
of
laughter
,
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Jean
.
''
--
``
That
is
right
,
''
said
he
.
And
he
turned
aside
so
that
*NL*
she
might
not
see
him
wipe
his
eyes
.

CHAPTER
III
--
THEY
RECALL
THE
GARDEN
OF
THE
RUE
PLUMET
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
last
time
.
After
that
last
flash
of
light
,
complete
*NL*
extinction
ensued
.
No
more
familiarity
,
no
more
good-morning
with
a
*NL*
kiss
,
never
more
that
word
so
profoundly
sweet
:
``
My
father
!
''
He
was
at
*NL*
his
own
request
and
through
his
own
complicity
driven
out
of
all
his
*NL*
happinesses
one
after
the
other
;
and
he
had
this
sorrow
,
that
after
*NL*
having
lost
Cosette
wholly
in
one
day
,
he
was
afterwards
obliged
to
lose
*NL*
her
again
in
detail
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
eye
eventually
becomes
accustomed
to
the
light
of
a
cellar
.
In
*NL*
short
,
it
sufficed
for
him
to
have
an
apparition
of
Cosette
every
day
.
*NL*
His
whole
life
was
concentrated
in
that
one
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seated
himself
close
to
her
,
he
gazed
at
her
in
silence
,
or
he
talked
*NL*
to
her
of
years
gone
by
,
of
her
childhood
,
of
the
convent
,
of
her
little
*NL*
friends
of
those
bygone
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
afternoon
,
--
it
was
on
one
of
those
early
days
in
April
,
already
*NL*
warm
and
fresh
,
the
moment
of
the
sun
's
great
gayety
,
the
gardens
which
*NL*
surrounded
the
windows
of
Marius
and
Cosette
felt
the
emotion
of
waking
,
*NL*
the
hawthorn
was
on
the
point
of
budding
,
a
jewelled
garniture
of
*NL*
gillyflowers
spread
over
the
ancient
walls
,
snapdragons
yawned
through
*NL*
the
crevices
of
the
stones
,
amid
the
grass
there
was
a
charming
*NL*
beginning
of
daisies
,
and
buttercups
,
the
white
butterflies
of
the
*NL*
year
were
making
their
first
appearance
,
the
wind
,
that
minstrel
of
the
*NL*
eternal
wedding
,
was
trying
in
the
trees
the
first
notes
of
that
grand
,
*NL*
auroral
symphony
which
the
old
poets
called
the
springtide
,
--
Marius
said
*NL*
to
Cosette
:
--
``
We
said
that
we
would
go
back
to
take
a
look
at
our
garden
*NL*
in
the
Rue
Plumet
.
Let
us
go
thither
.
We
must
not
be
ungrateful
.
''
--
And
*NL*
away
they
flitted
,
like
two
swallows
towards
the
spring
.
This
garden
of
*NL*
the
Rue
Plumet
produced
on
them
the
effect
of
the
dawn
.
They
already
*NL*
had
behind
them
in
life
something
which
was
like
the
springtime
of
their
*NL*
love
.
The
house
in
the
Rue
Plumet
being
held
on
a
lease
,
still
belonged
*NL*
to
Cosette
.
They
went
to
that
garden
and
that
house
.
There
they
*NL*
found
themselves
again
,
there
they
forgot
themselves
.
That
*NL*
evening
,
at
the
usual
hour
,
Jean
Valjean
came
to
the
Rue
des
*NL*
Filles-du-Calvaire
.
--
``
Madame
went
out
with
Monsieur
and
has
not
yet
*NL*
returned
,
''
Basque
said
to
him
.
He
seated
himself
in
silence
,
and
waited
*NL*
an
hour
.
Cosette
did
not
return
.
He
departed
with
drooping
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
was
so
intoxicated
with
her
walk
to
``
their
garden
,
''
and
so
*NL*
joyous
at
having
``
lived
a
whole
day
in
her
past
,
''
that
she
talked
of
*NL*
nothing
else
on
the
morrow
.
She
did
not
notice
that
she
had
not
seen
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
what
way
did
you
go
thither
?
''
Jean
Valjean
asked
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
foot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
did
you
return
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
hackney
carriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
time
,
Jean
Valjean
had
noticed
the
economical
life
led
by
the
*NL*
young
people
.
He
was
troubled
by
it
.
Marius
'
economy
was
severe
,
and
*NL*
that
word
had
its
absolute
meaning
for
Jean
Valjean
.
He
hazarded
a
*NL*
query
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
not
have
a
carriage
of
your
own
?
A
pretty
coupe
would
only
*NL*
cost
you
five
hundred
francs
a
month
.
You
are
rich
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
''
replied
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
like
Toussaint
,
''
resumed
Jean
Valjean
.
``
She
is
gone
.
You
have
not
*NL*
replaced
her
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nicolette
suffices
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ought
to
have
a
maid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
not
Marius
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
a
house
of
your
own
,
your
own
servants
,
a
carriage
,
a
*NL*
box
at
the
theatre
.
There
is
nothing
too
fine
for
you
.
Why
not
profit
by
*NL*
your
riches
?
Wealth
adds
to
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
's
visits
were
not
abridged
.
Far
from
it
.
When
it
is
the
*NL*
heart
which
is
slipping
,
one
does
not
halt
on
the
downward
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jean
Valjean
wished
to
prolong
his
visit
and
to
induce
*NL*
forgetfulness
of
the
hour
,
he
sang
the
praises
of
Marius
;
he
pronounced
*NL*
him
handsome
,
noble
,
courageous
,
witty
,
eloquent
,
good
.
Cosette
outdid
*NL*
him
.
Jean
Valjean
began
again
.
They
were
never
weary
.
Marius
--
that
word
*NL*
was
inexhaustible
;
those
six
letters
contained
volumes
.
In
this
manner
,
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
contrived
to
remain
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
so
sweet
to
see
Cosette
,
to
forget
by
her
side
!
It
alleviated
his
*NL*
wounds
.
It
frequently
happened
that
Basque
came
twice
to
announce
:
*NL*
``
M.
Gillenormand
sends
me
to
remind
Madame
la
Baronne
that
dinner
is
*NL*
served
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
those
days
,
Jean
Valjean
was
very
thoughtful
on
his
return
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
there
,
then
,
any
truth
in
that
comparison
of
the
chrysalis
which
*NL*
had
presented
itself
to
the
mind
of
Marius
?
Was
Jean
Valjean
really
a
*NL*
chrysalis
who
would
persist
,
and
who
would
come
to
visit
his
butterfly
?
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
remained
still
longer
than
usual
.
On
the
following
day
he
*NL*
observed
that
there
was
no
fire
on
the
hearth
.
--
``
Hello
!
''
he
thought
.
``
No
*NL*
fire
.
''
--
And
he
furnished
the
explanation
for
himself
.
--
``
It
is
perfectly
*NL*
simple
.
It
is
April
.
The
cold
weather
has
ceased
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
!
how
cold
it
is
here
!
''
exclaimed
Cosette
when
she
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
it
you
who
told
Basque
not
to
make
a
fire
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
since
we
are
now
in
the
month
of
May
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
we
have
a
fire
until
June
.
One
is
needed
all
the
year
in
this
*NL*
cellar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
that
a
fire
was
unnecessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
like
one
of
your
ideas
!
''
retorted
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
there
was
a
fire
.
But
the
two
arm-chairs
were
*NL*
arranged
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
near
the
door
.
''
--
What
is
the
*NL*
meaning
of
this
?
''
thought
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
for
the
arm-chairs
and
restored
them
to
their
ordinary
place
*NL*
near
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
fire
lighted
once
more
encouraged
him
,
however
.
He
prolonged
the
*NL*
conversation
even
beyond
its
customary
limits
.
As
he
rose
to
take
his
*NL*
leave
,
Cosette
said
to
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
said
a
queer
thing
to
me
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
was
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
said
to
me
:
`
Cosette
,
we
have
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
livres
.
*NL*
Twenty-seven
that
you
own
,
and
three
that
my
grandfather
gives
me
.
'
I
*NL*
replied
:
`
That
makes
thirty
.
'
He
went
on
:
`
Would
you
have
the
courage
to
*NL*
live
on
the
three
thousand
?
'
I
answered
:
`
Yes
,
on
nothing
.
Provided
*NL*
that
it
was
with
you
.
'
And
then
I
asked
:
`
Why
do
you
say
that
to
me
?
'
He
*NL*
replied
:
'
I
wanted
to
know
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
found
not
a
word
to
answer
.
Cosette
probably
expected
some
*NL*
explanation
from
him
;
he
listened
in
gloomy
silence
.
He
went
back
to
the
*NL*
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
;
he
was
so
deeply
absorbed
that
he
mistook
the
*NL*
door
and
instead
of
entering
his
own
house
,
he
entered
the
adjoining
*NL*
dwelling
.
It
was
only
after
having
ascended
nearly
two
stories
that
he
*NL*
perceived
his
error
and
went
down
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mind
was
swarming
with
conjectures
.
It
was
evident
that
Marius
had
*NL*
his
doubts
as
to
the
origin
of
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
,
that
*NL*
he
feared
some
source
that
was
not
pure
,
who
knows
?
that
he
had
even
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
discovered
that
the
money
came
from
him
,
Jean
Valjean
,
that
he
*NL*
hesitated
before
this
suspicious
fortune
,
and
was
disinclined
to
take
*NL*
it
as
his
own
,
--
preferring
that
both
he
and
Cosette
should
remain
poor
,
*NL*
rather
than
that
they
should
be
rich
with
wealth
that
was
not
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
Jean
Valjean
began
vaguely
to
surmise
that
he
was
being
shown
*NL*
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
,
he
underwent
something
like
a
shock
on
entering
*NL*
the
ground-floor
room
.
The
arm-chairs
had
disappeared
.
There
was
not
a
*NL*
single
chair
of
any
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
's
this
!
''
exclaimed
Cosette
as
she
entered
,
``
no
chairs
!
Where
*NL*
are
the
arm-chairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
no
longer
here
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
I
who
told
Basque
to
remove
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
your
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
a
few
minutes
to
stay
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
brief
stay
is
no
reason
for
remaining
standing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
Basque
needed
the
chairs
for
the
drawing-room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
company
this
evening
,
no
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
expect
no
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
had
not
another
word
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
have
the
chairs
carried
off
!
The
other
day
you
had
the
fire
put
out
.
*NL*
How
odd
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Adieu
!
''
murmured
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
say
:
``
Adieu
,
Cosette
.
''
But
he
had
not
the
strength
to
say
:
*NL*
``
Adieu
,
Madame
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
away
utterly
overwhelmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
time
he
had
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
he
did
not
come
.
Cosette
only
observed
the
fact
in
*NL*
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
said
she
,
``
Monsieur
Jean
has
not
been
here
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
felt
a
slight
twinge
at
her
heart
,
but
she
hardly
perceived
it
,
*NL*
being
immediately
diverted
by
a
kiss
from
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
following
day
he
did
not
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
paid
no
heed
to
this
,
passed
her
evening
and
slept
well
that
*NL*
night
,
as
usual
,
and
thought
of
it
only
when
she
woke
.
She
was
so
happy
!
*NL*
She
speedily
despatched
Nicolette
to
M.
Jean
's
house
to
inquire
whether
*NL*
he
were
ill
,
and
why
he
had
not
come
on
the
previous
evening
.
Nicolette
*NL*
brought
back
the
reply
of
M.
Jean
that
he
was
not
ill
.
He
was
busy
.
He
*NL*
would
come
soon
.
As
soon
as
he
was
able
.
Moreover
,
he
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
taking
a
little
journey
.
Madame
must
remember
that
it
was
his
custom
*NL*
to
take
trips
from
time
to
time
.
They
were
not
to
worry
about
him
.
They
*NL*
were
not
to
think
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nicolette
on
entering
M.
Jean
's
had
repeated
to
him
her
mistress
'
very
*NL*
words
.
That
Madame
had
sent
her
to
inquire
why
M.
Jean
bad
not
come
on
*NL*
the
preceding
evening
.
''
--
It
is
two
days
since
I
have
been
there
,
''
said
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
remark
passed
unnoticed
by
Nicolette
,
who
did
not
report
it
to
*NL*
Cosette

CHAPTER
IV
--
ATTRACTION
AND
EXTINCTION
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
last
months
of
spring
and
the
first
months
of
summer
in
1833
,
*NL*
the
rare
passersby
in
the
Marais
,
the
petty
shopkeepers
,
the
loungers
on
*NL*
thresholds
,
noticed
an
old
man
neatly
clad
in
black
,
who
emerged
every
*NL*
day
at
the
same
hour
,
towards
nightfall
,
from
the
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
*NL*
on
the
side
of
the
Rue
Sainte-Croix-de-la-Bretonnerie
,
passed
in
front
*NL*
of
the
Blancs
Manteaux
,
gained
the
Rue
Culture-Sainte-Catherine
,
and
,
*NL*
on
arriving
at
the
Rue
de
l'Echarpe
,
turned
to
the
left
,
and
entered
the
*NL*
Rue
Saint-Louis
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
he
walked
at
a
slow
pace
,
with
his
head
strained
forward
,
seeing
*NL*
nothing
,
hearing
nothing
,
his
eye
immovably
fixed
on
a
point
which
*NL*
seemed
to
be
a
star
to
him
,
which
never
varied
,
and
which
was
no
*NL*
other
than
the
corner
of
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
.
The
nearer
he
*NL*
approached
the
corner
of
the
street
the
more
his
eye
lighted
up
;
a
sort
*NL*
of
joy
illuminated
his
pupils
like
an
inward
aurora
,
he
had
a
fascinated
*NL*
and
much
affected
air
,
his
lips
indulged
in
obscure
movements
,
as
though
*NL*
he
were
talking
to
some
one
whom
he
did
not
see
,
he
smiled
vaguely
and
*NL*
advanced
as
slowly
as
possible
.
One
would
have
said
that
,
while
desirous
*NL*
of
reaching
his
destination
,
he
feared
the
moment
when
he
should
be
*NL*
close
at
hand
.
When
only
a
few
houses
remained
between
him
and
that
*NL*
street
which
appeared
to
attract
him
his
pace
slackened
,
to
such
a
*NL*
degree
that
,
at
times
,
one
might
have
thought
that
he
was
no
longer
*NL*
advancing
at
all
.
The
vacillation
of
his
head
and
the
fixity
of
his
*NL*
eyeballs
suggested
the
thought
of
the
magnetic
needle
seeking
the
pole
.
*NL*
Whatever
time
he
spent
on
arriving
,
he
was
obliged
to
arrive
at
last
;
he
*NL*
reached
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
;
then
he
halted
,
he
trembled
,
he
*NL*
thrust
his
head
with
a
sort
of
melancholy
timidity
round
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
last
house
,
and
gazed
into
that
street
,
and
there
was
in
that
tragic
*NL*
look
something
which
resembled
the
dazzling
light
of
the
impossible
,
*NL*
and
the
reflection
from
a
paradise
that
was
closed
to
him
.
Then
a
tear
,
*NL*
which
had
slowly
gathered
in
the
corner
of
his
lids
,
and
had
become
*NL*
large
enough
to
fall
,
trickled
down
his
cheek
,
and
sometimes
stopped
at
*NL*
his
mouth
.
The
old
man
tasted
its
bitter
flavor
.
Thus
he
remained
for
*NL*
several
minutes
as
though
made
of
stone
,
then
he
returned
by
the
same
*NL*
road
and
with
the
same
step
,
and
,
in
proportion
as
he
retreated
,
his
*NL*
glance
died
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
by
little
,
this
old
man
ceased
to
go
as
far
as
the
corner
of
the
*NL*
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
;
he
halted
half
way
in
the
Rue
Saint-Louis
;
*NL*
sometimes
a
little
further
off
,
sometimes
a
little
nearer
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
he
stopped
at
the
corner
of
the
Rue
Culture-Sainte-Catherine
and
*NL*
looked
at
the
Rue
des
Filles-du-Calvaire
from
a
distance
.
Then
he
*NL*
shook
his
head
slowly
from
right
to
left
,
as
though
refusing
himself
*NL*
something
,
and
retraced
his
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
he
no
longer
came
as
far
as
the
Rue
Saint-Louis
.
He
got
as
far
as
*NL*
the
Rue
Pavee
,
shook
his
head
and
turned
back
;
then
he
went
no
*NL*
further
than
the
Rue
des
Trois-Pavillons
;
then
he
did
not
overstep
the
*NL*
Blancs-Manteaux
.
One
would
have
said
that
he
was
a
pendulum
which
was
*NL*
no
longer
wound
up
,
and
whose
oscillations
were
growing
shorter
before
*NL*
ceasing
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
day
he
emerged
from
his
house
at
the
same
hour
,
he
undertook
the
*NL*
same
trip
,
but
he
no
longer
completed
it
,
and
,
perhaps
without
*NL*
himself
being
aware
of
the
fact
,
he
constantly
shortened
it
.
His
whole
*NL*
countenance
expressed
this
single
idea
:
What
is
the
use
?
--
His
eye
was
*NL*
dim
;
no
more
radiance
.
His
tears
were
also
exhausted
;
they
no
longer
*NL*
collected
in
the
corner
of
his
eye-lid
;
that
thoughtful
eye
was
dry
.
The
*NL*
old
man
's
head
was
still
craned
forward
;
his
chin
moved
at
times
;
the
*NL*
folds
in
his
gaunt
neck
were
painful
to
behold
.
Sometimes
,
when
the
*NL*
weather
was
bad
,
he
had
an
umbrella
under
his
arm
,
but
he
never
opened
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
women
of
the
quarter
said
:
``
He
is
an
innocent
.
''
The
children
*NL*
followed
him
and
laughed
.

CHAPTER
I

PITY
FOR
THE
UNHAPPY
,
BUT
INDULGENCE
FOR
THE
HAPPY
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
happy
!
How
content
one
is
!
How
*NL*
all-sufficient
one
finds
it
!
How
,
being
in
possession
of
the
false
*NL*
object
of
life
,
happiness
,
one
forgets
the
true
object
,
duty
!
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
say
,
however
,
that
the
reader
would
do
wrong
were
he
to
blame
*NL*
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
as
we
have
explained
,
before
his
marriage
,
had
put
no
questions
*NL*
to
M.
Fauchelevent
,
and
,
since
that
time
,
he
had
feared
to
put
any
to
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
.
He
had
regretted
the
promise
into
which
he
had
allowed
*NL*
himself
to
be
drawn
.
He
had
often
said
to
himself
that
he
had
done
*NL*
wrong
in
making
that
concession
to
despair
.
He
had
confined
himself
to
*NL*
gradually
estranging
Jean
Valjean
from
his
house
and
to
effacing
him
,
*NL*
as
much
as
possible
,
from
Cosette
's
mind
.
He
had
,
in
a
manner
,
always
*NL*
placed
himself
between
Cosette
and
Jean
Valjean
,
sure
that
,
in
this
*NL*
way
,
she
would
not
perceive
nor
think
of
the
latter
.
It
was
more
than
*NL*
effacement
,
it
was
an
eclipse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
did
what
he
considered
necessary
and
just
.
He
thought
that
he
had
*NL*
serious
reasons
which
the
reader
has
already
seen
,
and
others
which
will
*NL*
be
seen
later
on
,
for
getting
rid
of
Jean
Valjean
without
harshness
,
but
*NL*
without
weakness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Chance
having
ordained
that
he
should
encounter
,
in
a
case
which
he
had
*NL*
argued
,
a
former
employee
of
the
Laffitte
establishment
,
he
had
acquired
*NL*
mysterious
information
,
without
seeking
it
,
which
he
had
not
been
*NL*
able
,
it
is
true
,
to
probe
,
out
of
respect
for
the
secret
which
he
had
*NL*
promised
to
guard
,
and
out
of
consideration
for
Jean
Valjean
's
perilous
*NL*
position
.
He
believed
at
that
moment
that
he
had
a
grave
duty
to
*NL*
perform
:
the
restitution
of
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
to
some
*NL*
one
whom
he
sought
with
all
possible
discretion
.
In
the
meanwhile
,
he
*NL*
abstained
from
touching
that
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Cosette
,
she
had
not
been
initiated
into
any
of
these
secrets
;
*NL*
but
it
would
be
harsh
to
condemn
her
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
existed
between
Marius
and
her
an
all-powerful
magnetism
,
which
*NL*
caused
her
to
do
,
instinctively
and
almost
mechanically
,
what
Marius
*NL*
wished
.
She
was
conscious
of
Marius
'
will
in
the
direction
of
``
Monsieur
*NL*
Jean
,
''
she
conformed
to
it
.
Her
husband
had
not
been
obliged
to
say
*NL*
anything
to
her
;
she
yielded
to
the
vague
but
clear
pressure
of
his
*NL*
tacit
intentions
,
and
obeyed
blindly
.
Her
obedience
in
this
instance
*NL*
consisted
in
not
remembering
what
Marius
forgot
.
She
was
not
obliged
to
*NL*
make
any
effort
to
accomplish
this
.
Without
her
knowing
why
herself
,
and
*NL*
without
his
having
any
cause
to
accuse
her
of
it
,
her
soul
had
become
*NL*
so
wholly
her
husband
's
that
that
which
was
shrouded
in
gloom
in
Marius
'
*NL*
mind
became
overcast
in
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
not
go
too
far
,
however
;
in
what
concerns
Jean
Valjean
,
this
*NL*
forgetfulness
and
obliteration
were
merely
superficial
.
She
was
rather
*NL*
heedless
than
forgetful
.
At
bottom
,
she
was
sincerely
attached
to
the
*NL*
man
whom
she
had
so
long
called
her
father
;
but
she
loved
her
husband
*NL*
still
more
dearly
.
This
was
what
had
somewhat
disturbed
the
balance
of
*NL*
her
heart
,
which
leaned
to
one
side
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
sometimes
happened
that
Cosette
spoke
of
Jean
Valjean
and
expressed
*NL*
her
surprise
.
Then
Marius
calmed
her
:
``
He
is
absent
,
I
think
.
Did
not
*NL*
he
say
that
he
was
setting
out
on
a
journey
?
''
--
``
That
is
true
,
''
thought
*NL*
Cosette
.
``
He
had
a
habit
of
disappearing
in
this
fashion
.
But
not
for
so
*NL*
long
.
''
Two
or
three
times
she
despatched
Nicolette
to
inquire
in
the
*NL*
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
whether
M.
Jean
had
returned
from
his
journey
.
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
caused
the
answer
``
no
''
to
be
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
asked
nothing
more
,
since
she
had
but
one
need
on
earth
,
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
also
say
that
,
on
their
side
,
Cosette
and
Marius
had
also
*NL*
been
absent
.
They
had
been
to
Vernon
.
Marius
had
taken
Cosette
to
his
*NL*
father
's
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gradually
won
Cosette
away
from
Jean
Valjean
.
Cosette
allowed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
that
which
is
called
,
far
too
harshly
in
certain
cases
,
the
*NL*
ingratitude
of
children
,
is
not
always
a
thing
so
deserving
of
reproach
*NL*
as
it
is
supposed
.
It
is
the
ingratitude
of
nature
.
Nature
,
as
we
have
*NL*
elsewhere
said
,
``
looks
before
her
.
''
Nature
divides
living
beings
into
*NL*
those
who
are
arriving
and
those
who
are
departing
.
Those
who
are
*NL*
departing
are
turned
towards
the
shadows
,
those
who
are
arriving
towards
*NL*
the
light
.
Hence
a
gulf
which
is
fatal
on
the
part
of
the
old
,
and
*NL*
involuntary
on
the
part
of
the
young
.
This
breach
,
at
first
insensible
,
*NL*
increases
slowly
,
like
all
separations
of
branches
.
The
boughs
,
without
*NL*
becoming
detached
from
the
trunk
,
grow
away
from
it
.
It
is
no
fault
of
*NL*
theirs
.
Youth
goes
where
there
is
joy
,
festivals
,
vivid
lights
,
love
.
*NL*
Old
age
goes
towards
the
end
.
They
do
not
lose
sight
of
each
other
,
but
*NL*
there
is
no
longer
a
close
connection
.
Young
people
feel
the
cooling
*NL*
off
of
life
;
old
people
,
that
of
the
tomb
.
Let
us
not
blame
these
poor
*NL*
children
.

CHAPTER

LAST
FLICKERINGS
OF
A
LAMP
WITHOUT
OIL
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
Jean
Valjean
descended
his
staircase
,
took
three
steps
in
the
*NL*
street
,
seated
himself
on
a
post
,
on
that
same
stone
post
where
Gavroche
*NL*
had
found
him
meditating
on
the
night
between
the
5th
and
the
6th
of
*NL*
June
;
he
remained
there
a
few
moments
,
then
went
up
stairs
again
.
This
*NL*
was
the
last
oscillation
of
the
pendulum
.
On
the
following
day
he
did
*NL*
not
leave
his
apartment
.
On
the
day
after
that
,
he
did
not
leave
his
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
portress
,
who
prepared
his
scanty
repasts
,
a
few
cabbages
or
*NL*
potatoes
with
bacon
,
glanced
at
the
brown
earthenware
plate
and
*NL*
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
ate
nothing
yesterday
,
poor
,
dear
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
did
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
plate
is
quite
full
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look

jug

It

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
proves
that
you
have
drunk

it
does
not
prove
that
you

*NL*
eaten

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
what

I

hungry

for
water
?

*NL*

``
That
is

*NL*
``
I
will
eat
to-morrow

*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
at
Trinity
day

Why
not
to-day
?
Is
it
the
thing
to
say
:
'
I
will
eat
*NL*
to-morrow
'
?
The
idea
of
leaving
my
platter
without
even
touching
it
!
My
*NL*
ladyfinger
potatoes
were
so
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
took
the
old
woman
's
hand
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
you
that
I
will
eat
them
,
''
he
said
,
in
his
benevolent
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
pleased
with
you
,
''
replied
the
portress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
saw
no
other
human
creature
than
this
good
woman
.
There
are
*NL*
streets
in
Paris
through
which
no
one
ever
passes
,
and
houses
to
which
*NL*
no
one
ever
comes
.
He
was
in
one
of
those
streets
and
one
of
those
*NL*
houses
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
still
went
out
,
he
had
purchased
of
a
coppersmith
,
for
a
few
*NL*
sous
,
a
little
copper
crucifix
which
he
had
hung
up
on
a
nail
opposite
*NL*
his
bed
.
That
gibbet
is
always
good
to
look
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
passed
,
and
Jean
Valjean
had
not
taken
a
step
in
his
room
.
He
*NL*
still
remained
in
bed
.
The
portress
said
to
her
husband
:
--
``
The
good
man
*NL*
upstairs
yonder
does
not
get
up
,
he
no
longer
eats

he
will
not

long

That
man
has
his
sorrows

that
he
has

You
wo
n't
get
it
out
of
my
*NL*
head
that
his
daughter
has
made
a
bad
marriage

*NL*
*NL*
The
porter
replied
,
with
the
tone
of
marital
sovereignty
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
's
rich
,
let
him
have
a

If

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
he
has
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
will
die

''
said
the
porter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
portress
set
to
scraping
away
the
grass
from
what
she
called
her
*NL*
pavement
,
with
an
old
knife
,
and
,
as
she
tore
out
the
blades
,
she
*NL*
grumbled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
shame
.
Such
a
neat
old
man
!
He
's
as
white
as
a
chicken

*NL*
*NL*
She
caught
sight
of
the
doctor
of
the
quarter
as
he
passed
the
end
of
*NL*
the
street
;
she
took
it
upon
herself
to
request
him
to
come
up
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
on
the
second
floor

said
she

``
You

The
doctor
saw
Jean
Valjean
and
spoke
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
came
down
again
the

interrogated
him

CHAPTER
III
--
A
PEN
IS
HEAVY
TO
THE
MAN
WHO
LIFTED
THE
FAUCHELEVENT
'S
*NL*
CART
*NL*
*NL*
One
evening
Jean
Valjean
found
difficulty
in
raising
himself
on
his
*NL*
elbow
;
he
felt
of
his
wrist
and
could
not
find
his
pulse
;
his
breath
*NL*
was
short
and
halted
at
times
;
he
recognized
the
fact
that
he
was
weaker
*NL*
than
he
had
ever
been
before
.
Then
,
no
doubt
under
the
pressure
of
some
*NL*
supreme
preoccupation
,
he
made
an
effort
,
drew
himself
up
into
a
sitting
*NL*
posture
and
dressed
himself
.
He
put
on
his
old
workingman
's
clothes
.
As
*NL*
he
no
longer
went
out
,
he
had
returned
to
them
and
preferred
them
.
He
*NL*
was
obliged
to
pause
many
times
while
dressing
himself
;
merely
putting
*NL*
his
arms
through
his
waistcoat
made
the
perspiration
trickle
from
his
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
had
been
alone
,
he
had
placed
his
bed
in
the
antechamber
,
in
*NL*
order
to
inhabit
that
deserted
apartment
as
little
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
valise
and
drew
from
it
Cosette
's
outfit
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spread
it
out
on
his
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bishop
's
candlesticks
were
in
their
place
on
the
chimney-piece
.
He
*NL*
took
from
a
drawer
two
wax
candles
and
put
them
in
the
candlesticks
.
*NL*
Then
,
although
it
was
still
broad
daylight
,
--
it
was
summer
,
--
he
lighted
*NL*
them
.
In
the
same
way
candles
are
to
be
seen
lighted
in
broad
daylight
*NL*
in
chambers
where
there
is
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
step
that
he
took
in
going
from
one
piece
of
furniture
to
another
*NL*
exhausted
him
,
and
he
was
obliged
to
sit
down
.
It
was
not
ordinary
*NL*
fatigue
which
expends
the
strength
only
to
renew
it
;
it
was
the
remnant
*NL*
of
all
movement
possible
to
him
,
it
was
life
drained
which
flows
away
*NL*
drop
by
drop
in
overwhelming
efforts
and
which
will
never
be
renewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chair
into
which
he
allowed
himself
to
fall
was
placed
in
front
of
*NL*
that
mirror
,
so
fatal
for
him
,
so
providential
for
Marius
,
in
which
*NL*
he
had
read
Cosette
's
reversed
writing
on
the
blotting
book
.
He
caught
*NL*
sight
of
himself
in
this
mirror
,
and
did
not
recognize
himself
.
He
was
*NL*
eighty
years
old
;
before
Marius
'
marriage
,
he
would
have
hardly
been
*NL*
taken
for
fifty
;
that
year
had
counted
for
thirty
.
What
he
bore
on
his
*NL*
brow
was
no
longer
the
wrinkles
of
age
,
it
was
the
mysterious
mark
of
*NL*
death
.
The
hollowing
of
that
pitiless
nail
could
be
felt
there
.
His
*NL*
cheeks
were
pendulous
;
the
skin
of
his
face
had
the
color
which
would
*NL*
lead
one
to
think
that
it
already
had
earth
upon
it
;
the
corners
of
his
*NL*
mouth
drooped
as
in
the
mask
which
the
ancients
sculptured
on
tombs
.
He
*NL*
gazed
into
space
with
an
air
of
reproach
;
one
would
have
said
that
he
*NL*
was
one
of
those
grand
tragic
beings
who
have
cause
to
complain
of
some
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
that
condition
,
the
last
phase
of
dejection
,
in
which
sorrow
*NL*
no
longer
flows
;
it
is
coagulated
,
so
to
speak
;
there
is
something
on
*NL*
the
soul
like
a
clot
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Night
had
come
.
He
laboriously
dragged
a
table
and
the
old
arm-chair
to
*NL*
the
fireside
,
and
placed
upon
the
table
a
pen
,
some
ink
and
some
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
,
he
had
a
fainting
fit
.
When
he
recovered
consciousness
,
he
*NL*
was
thirsty
.
As
he
could
not
lift
the
jug
,
he
tipped
it
over
painfully
*NL*
towards
his
mouth
,
and
swallowed
a
draught
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
neither
the
pen
nor
the
ink
had
been
used
for
a
long
time
,
the
point
*NL*
of
the
pen
had
curled
up
,
the
ink
had
dried
away
,
he
was
forced
to
rise
*NL*
and
put
a
few
drops
of
water
in
the
ink
,
which
he
did
not
accomplish
*NL*
without
pausing
and
sitting
down
two
or
three
times
,
and
he
was
*NL*
compelled
to
write
with
the
back
of
the
pen
.
He
wiped
his
brow
from
time
*NL*
to
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
turned
towards
the
bed
,
and
,
still
seated
,
for
he
could
not
*NL*
stand
,
he
gazed
at
the
little
black
gown
and
all
those
beloved
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
contemplations
lasted
for
hours
which
seemed
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
shivered
,
he
felt
that
a
child
was
taking
possession
of
*NL*
him
;
he
rested
his
elbows
on
the
table
,
which
was
illuminated
by
the
*NL*
Bishop
's
candles
and
took
up
the
pen
.
His
hand
trembled
.
He
wrote
slowly
*NL*
the
few
following
lines
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
,
I
bless
thee
.
I
am
going
to
explain
to
thee
.
Thy
husband
was
*NL*
right
in
giving
me
to
understand
that
I
ought
to
go
away
;
but
there
is
*NL*
a
little
error
in
what
he
believed
,
though
he
was
in
the
right
.
He
is
*NL*
excellent
.
Love
him
well
even
after
I
am
dead
.
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
love
*NL*
my
darling
child
well
.
Cosette
,
this
paper
will
be
found
;
this
is
what
*NL*
I
wish
to
say
to
thee
,
thou
wilt
see
the
figures
,
if
I
have
the
strength
*NL*
to
recall
them
,
listen
well
,
this
money
is
really
thine
.
Here
is
the
*NL*
whole
matter
:
White
jet
comes
from
Norway
,
black
jet
comes
from
England
,
*NL*
black
glass
jewellery
comes
from
Germany
.
Jet
is
the
lightest
,
the
most
*NL*
precious
,
the
most
costly
.
Imitations
can
be
made
in
France
as
well
as
*NL*
in
Germany
.
What
is
needed
is
a
little
anvil
two
inches
square
,
and
a
*NL*
lamp
burning
spirits
of
wine
to
soften
the
wax
.
The
wax
was
formerly
*NL*
made
with
resin
and
lampblack
,
and
cost
four
livres
the
pound
.
I
*NL*
invented
a
way
of
making
it
with
gum
shellac
and
turpentine
.
It
does
not
*NL*
cost
more
than
thirty
sous
,
and
is
much
better
.
Buckles
are
made
with
*NL*
a
violet
glass
which
is
stuck
fast
,
by
means
of
this
wax
,
to
a
little
*NL*
framework
of
black
iron
.
The
glass
must
be
violet
for
iron
jewellery
,
*NL*
and
black
for
gold
jewellery
.
Spain
buys
a
great
deal
of
it
.
It
is
the
*NL*
country
of
jet
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
paused
,
the
pen
fell
from
his
fingers
,
he
was
seized
by
one
of
*NL*
those
sobs
which
at
times
welled
up
from
the
very
depths
of
his
being
;
*NL*
the
poor
man
clasped
his
head
in
both
hands
,
and
meditated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
he
exclaimed
within
himself
-LSB-
lamentable
cries
,
heard
by
God
*NL*
alone
-RSB-
,
``
all
is
over
.
I
shall
never
see
her
more
.
She
is
a
smile
which
*NL*
passed
over
me
.
I
am
about
to
plunge
into
the
night
without
even
seeing
*NL*
her
again
.
Oh
!
one
minute
,
one
instant
,
to
hear
her
voice
,
to
touch
her
*NL*
dress
,
to
gaze
upon
her
,
upon
her
,
the
angel
!
and
then
to
die
!
It
is
*NL*
nothing
to
die
,
what
is
frightful
is
to
die
without
seeing
her
.
She
*NL*
would
smile
on
me
,
she
would
say
a
word
to
me
,
would
that
do
any
harm
to
*NL*
any
one
?
No
,
all
is
over
,
and
forever
.
Here
I
am
all
alone
.
My
God
!
My
*NL*
God
!
I
shall
never
see
her
again

At
that
moment
there
came
a
knock
at
*NL*
the
door

CHAPTER

A
BOTTLE
OF
INK
WHICH
ONLY
SUCCEEDED
IN
WHITENING
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
day
,
or
to
speak
more
accurately
,
that
same
evening
,
as
Marius
*NL*
left
the
table
,
and
was
on
the
point
of
withdrawing
to
his
study
,
having
*NL*
a
case
to
look
over
,
Basque
handed
him
a
letter
saying
:
``
The
person
who
*NL*
wrote
the
letter
is
in
the
antechamber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
had
taken
the
grandfather
's
arm
and
was
strolling
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
letter
,
like
a
man
,
may
have
an
unprepossessing
exterior
.
Coarse
*NL*
paper
,
coarsely
folded
--
the
very
sight
of
certain
missives
is
*NL*
displeasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
which
Basque
had
brought
was
of
this
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
took
it
.
It
smelled
of
tobacco
.
Nothing
evokes
a
memory
like
an
*NL*
odor
.
Marius
recognized
that
tobacco
.
He
looked
at
the
superscription
:
*NL*
``
To
Monsieur
,
Monsieur
le
Baron
Pommerci
.
At
his
hotel
.
''
The
recognition
*NL*
of
the
tobacco
caused
him
to
recognize
the
writing
as
well
.
It
may
be
*NL*
said
that
amazement
has
its
lightning
flashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
,
as
it
were
,
illuminated
by
one
of
these
flashes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sense
of
smell
,
that
mysterious
aid
to
memory
,
had
just
revived
a
*NL*
whole
world
within
him
.
This
was
certainly
the
paper
,
the
fashion
*NL*
of
folding
,
the
dull
tint
of
ink
;
it
was
certainly
the
well-known
*NL*
handwriting
,
especially
was
it
the
same
tobacco
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jondrette
garret
rose
before
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
,
strange
freak
of
chance
!
one
of
the
two
scents
which
he
had
so
*NL*
diligently
sought
,
the
one
in
connection
with
which
he
had
lately
again
*NL*
exerted
so
many
efforts
and
which
he
supposed
to
be
forever
lost
,
had
*NL*
come
and
presented
itself
to
him
of
its
own
accord
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
eagerly
broke
the
seal
,
and
read
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
:
--
If
the
Supreme
Being

but
I
am
not

I
only
bear
the

I
will
furnish

with
the
simple

of
driving
from

family
*NL*
that
individual
who
has
no

madame

The

This
signature
was
not
false

It
was
merely
a
trifle
abridged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
rigmarole
and
the
orthography
completed
the
revelation
.
*NL*
The
certificate
of
origin
was
complete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
emotion
was
profound
.
After
a
start
of
surprise
,
he
underwent
a
*NL*
feeling
of
happiness
.
If
he
could
now
but
find
that
other
man
of
whom
he
*NL*
was
in
search
,
the
man
who
had
saved
him
,
Marius
,
there
would
be
nothing
*NL*
left
for
him
to
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
opened
the
drawer
of
his
secretary
,
took
out
several
bank-notes
,
*NL*
put
them
in
his
pocket
,
closed
the
secretary
again
,
and
rang
the
bell
.
*NL*
Basque
half
opened
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Show
the
man
in
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Basque
announced
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
Thenard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fresh
surprise
for
Marius
.
The
man
who
entered
was
an
utter
stranger
*NL*
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
man
,
who
was
old
,
moreover
,
had
a
thick
nose
,
his
chin
swathed
in
a
*NL*
cravat
,
green
spectacles
with
a
double
screen
of
green
taffeta
over
his
*NL*
eyes
,
and
his
hair
was
plastered
and
flattened
down
on
his
brow
on
*NL*
a
level
with
his
eyebrows
like
the
wigs
of
English
coachmen
in
``
high
*NL*
life
.
''
His
hair
was
gray
.
He
was
dressed
in
black
from
head
to
foot
,
in
*NL*
garments
that
were
very
threadbare
but
clean
;
a
bunch
of
seals
depending
*NL*
from
his
fob
suggested
the
idea
of
a
watch
.
He
held
in
his
hand
an
old
*NL*
hat
!
He
walked
in
a
bent
attitude
,
and
the
curve
in
his
spine
augmented
*NL*
the
profundity
of
his
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
thing
that
struck
the
observer
was
,
that
this
personage
's
*NL*
coat
,
which
was
too
ample
although
carefully
buttoned
,
had
not
been
made
*NL*
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
a
short
digression
becomes
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
in
Paris
at
that
epoch
,
in
a
low-lived
old
lodging
in
the
Rue
*NL*
Beautreillis
,
near
the
Arsenal
,
an
ingenious
Jew
whose
profession
was
*NL*
to
change
villains
into
honest
men
.
Not
for
too
long
,
which
might
have
*NL*
proved
embarrassing
for
the
villain
.
The
change
was
on
sight
,
for
a
day
*NL*
or
two
,
at
the
rate
of
thirty
sous
a
day
,
by
means
of
a
costume
which
*NL*
resembled
the
honesty
of
the
world
in
general
as
nearly
as
possible
.
*NL*
This
costumer
was
called
``
the
Changer
''
;
the
pickpockets
of
Paris
*NL*
had
given
him
this
name
and
knew
him
by
no
other
.
He
had
a
tolerably
*NL*
complete
wardrobe
.
The
rags
with
which
he
tricked
out
people
were
almost
*NL*
probable
.
He
had
specialties
and
categories
;
on
each
nail
of
his
*NL*
shop
hung
a
social
status
,
threadbare
and
worn
;
here
the
suit
of
a
*NL*
magistrate
,
there
the
outfit
of
a
Cure
,
beyond
the
outfit
of
a
banker
,
*NL*
in
one
corner
the
costume
of
a
retired
military
man
,
elsewhere
*NL*
the
habiliments
of
a
man
of
letters
,
and
further
on
the
dress
of
a
*NL*
statesman
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
creature
was
the
costumer
of
the
immense
drama
which
knavery
plays
*NL*
in
Paris
.
His
lair
was
the
green-room
whence
theft
emerged
,
and
into
*NL*
which
roguery
retreated
.
A
tattered
knave
arrived
at
this
dressing-room
,
*NL*
deposited
his
thirty
sous
and
selected
,
according
to
the
part
which
*NL*
he
wished
to
play
,
the
costume
which
suited
him
,
and
on
descending
the
*NL*
stairs
once
more
,
the
knave
was
a
somebody
.
On
the
following
day
,
the
*NL*
clothes
were
faithfully
returned
,
and
the
Changer
,
who
trusted
the
*NL*
thieves
with
everything
,
was
never
robbed
.
There
was
one
inconvenience
*NL*
about
these
clothes
,
they
``
did
not
fit
''
;
not
having
been
made
for
those
*NL*
who
wore
them
,
they
were
too
tight
for
one
,
too
loose
for
another
and
*NL*
did
not
adjust
themselves
to
any
one
.
Every
pickpocket
who
exceeded
or
*NL*
fell
short
of
the
human
average
was
ill
at
his
ease
in
the
Changer
's
*NL*
costumes
.
It
was
necessary
that
one
should
not
be
either
too
fat
or
*NL*
too
lean
.
The
changer
had
foreseen
only
ordinary
men
.
He
had
taken
the
*NL*
measure
of
the
species
from
the
first
rascal
who
came
to
hand
,
who
is
*NL*
neither
stout
nor
thin
,
neither
tall
nor
short
.
Hence
adaptations
which
*NL*
were
sometimes
difficult
and
from
which
the
Changer
's
clients
extricated
*NL*
themselves
as
best
they
might
.
So
much
the
worse
for
the
exceptions
!
*NL*
The
suit
of
the
statesman
,
for
instance
,
black
from
head
to
foot
,
and
*NL*
consequently
proper
,
would
have
been
too
large
for
Pitt
and
too
small
*NL*
for
Castelcicala
.
The
costume
of
a
statesman
was
designated
as
follows
*NL*
in
the
Changer
's
catalogue
;
we
copy
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
coat
of
black
cloth
,
trowsers
of
black
wool
,
a
silk
waistcoat
,
boots
*NL*
and
linen
.
''
On
the
margin
there
stood
:
ex-ambassador
,
and
a
note
*NL*
which
we
also
copy
:
``
In
a
separate
box
,
a
neatly
frizzed
peruke
,
green
*NL*
glasses
,
seals
,
and
two
small
quills
an
inch
long
,
wrapped
in
cotton
.
''
*NL*
All
this
belonged
to
the
statesman
,
the
ex-ambassador
.
This
whole
*NL*
costume
was
,
if
we
may
so
express
ourselves
,
debilitated
;
the
seams
were
*NL*
white
,
a
vague
button-hole
yawned
at
one
of
the
elbows
;
moreover
,
one
of
*NL*
the
coat
buttons
was
missing
on
the
breast
;
but
this
was
only
detail
;
as
*NL*
the
hand
of
the
statesman
should
always
be
thrust
into
his
coat
and
laid
*NL*
upon
his
heart
,
its
function
was
to
conceal
the
absent
button
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Marius
had
been
familiar
with
the
occult
institutions
of
Paris
,
he
*NL*
would
instantly
have
recognized
upon
the
back
of
the
visitor
whom
*NL*
Basque
had
just
shown
in
,
the
statesman
's
suit
borrowed
from
the
*NL*
pick-me-down-that
shop
of
the
Changer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
disappointment
on
beholding
another
man
than
the
one
whom
he
*NL*
expected
to
see
turned
to
the
newcomer
's
disadvantage
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
surveyed
him
from
head
to
foot
,
while
that
personage
made
exaggerated
*NL*
bows
,
and
demanded
in
a
curt
tone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
replied
with
an
amiable
grin
of
which
the
caressing
smile
of
a
*NL*
crocodile
will
furnish
some
idea
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
impossible
that
I
should
not
have
already
had
the
honor
*NL*
of
seeing
Monsieur
le
Baron
in
society
.
I
think
I
actually
did
meet
*NL*
monsieur
personally
,
several
years
ago
,
at
the
house
of
Madame
la
*NL*
Princesse
Bagration
and
in
the
drawing-rooms
of
his
Lordship
the
Vicomte
*NL*
Dambray
,
peer
of
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
always
a
good
bit
of
tactics
in
knavery
to
pretend
to
recognize
*NL*
some
one
whom
one
does
not
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
paid
attention
to
the
manner
of
this
man
's
speech
.
He
spied
*NL*
on
his
accent
and
gesture
,
but
his
disappointment
increased
;
the
*NL*
pronunciation
was
nasal
and
absolutely
unlike
the
dry
,
shrill
tone
which
*NL*
he
had
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
utterly
routed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
neither
Madame
Bagration
nor
M.
Dambray
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
have
never
*NL*
set
foot
in
the
house
of
either
of
them
in
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
reply
was
ungracious
.
The
personage
,
determined
to
be
gracious
at
*NL*
any
cost
,
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
must
have
been
at
Chateaubriand
's
that
I
have
seen
Monsieur
!
I
*NL*
know
Chateaubriand
very
well
.
He
is
very
affable
.
He
sometimes
says
to
*NL*
me
:
`
Thenard
,
my
friend
...
wo
n't
you
drink
a
glass
of
wine
with
me
?
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
brow
grew
more
and
more
severe
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
had
the
honor
of
being
received
by
M.
de
Chateaubriand
.
*NL*
Let
us
cut
it
short
.
What
do
you
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
bowed
lower
at
that
harsh
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
deign
to
listen
to
me
.
There
is
in
America
,
in
a
*NL*
district
near
Panama
,
a
village
called
la
Joya
.
That
village
is
composed
*NL*
of
a
single
house
,
a
large
,
square
house

three

built
of

bricks
dried
in
the
sun

of
the
square
five
hundred
feet
in
*NL*
length
,
each
story
retreating
twelve
feet
back
of
the
story
below
,
in
*NL*
such
a
manner
as
to
leave
in
front
a
terrace
which
makes
the
circuit
*NL*
of
the
edifice
,
in
the
centre
an
inner
court
where
the
provisions
and
*NL*
munitions
are
kept
;
no
windows
,
loopholes
,
no
doors
,
ladders
,
ladders

to
mount
from

ground

second

from

inner

no
doors

the
chambers

trap-doors

no
staircases

the
*NL*

in
the

the

are
closed

Why

dangerous

it
is
full
of
cannibals

*NL*
``

interrupted
Marius

passed
from

disappointment

``

Marius

The
stranger
stretched
his

out

his
cravat

a

characteristic
of

``

There
was
some
truth
in
this

The
fact
is
,
that
the
contents
of
the
*NL*
epistle
had
slipped
Marius
'
mind
.
He
had
seen
the
writing
rather
than
*NL*
read
the
letter
.
He
could
hardly
recall
it
.
But
a
moment
ago
a
fresh
*NL*
start
had
been
given
him
.
He
had
noted
that
detail
:
``
my
spouse
and
my
*NL*
young
lady

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fixed
a
penetrating
glance
on
the
stranger
.
An
examining
judge
could
*NL*
not
have
done
the
look
better
.
He
almost
lay
in
wait
for
him

*NL*
*NL*
He
confined
himself
to
replying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
State

*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
inserted
his
two
hands
in
both
his
fobs
,
drew
himself
up
*NL*
without
straightening
his
dorsal
column
,
but
scrutinizing
Marius
in
his
*NL*
turn
,
with
the
green
gaze
of
his
spectacles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

more

The

went
on

*NL*
I
speak
of
recent
deeds
,
of
actual
facts
as
still
unknown
to
justice
*NL*
at
this
hour
.
I
continue
.
This
man
has
insinuated
himself
into
your
*NL*
confidence
,
and
almost
into
your
family
under
a
false
name
.
I
am
about
*NL*
to
tell
you
his
real
name
.
And
to
tell
it
to
you
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
listening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
name
is
Jean
Valjean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
tell
you
,
equally
for
nothing
,
who
he
is

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
an
ex-convict

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
it
since
I
have
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
knew
it
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
cold
tone
,
that
double
reply
of
``
I
know
it
,
''
his
laconicism
,
*NL*
which
was
not
favorable
to
dialogue
,
stirred
up
some
smouldering
wrath
*NL*
in
the
stranger
.
He
launched
a
furious
glance
on
the
sly
at
Marius
,
*NL*
which
was
instantly
extinguished
.
Rapid
as
it
was
,
this
glance
was
of
*NL*
the
kind
which
a
man
recognizes
when
he
has
once
beheld
it
;
it
did
not
*NL*
escape
Marius
.
Certain
flashes
can
only
proceed
from
certain
souls
;
*NL*
the
eye
,
that
vent-hole
of
the
thought
,
glows
with
it
;
spectacles
hide
*NL*
nothing
;
try
putting
a
pane
of
glass
over
hell
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
stranger
resumed
with
a
smile
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
permit
myself
to
contradict
Monsieur
le
Baron
.
In
any
case
,
*NL*
you
ought
to
perceive
that
I
am
well
informed
.
Now
what
I
have
to
tell
*NL*
you
is
known
to
myself
alone
.
This
concerns
the
fortune
of
Madame
la
*NL*
Baronne
.
It
is
an
extraordinary
secret
.
It
is
for
sale
--
I
make
you
the
*NL*
first
offer
of
it
.
Cheap
.
Twenty
thousand
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
secret
as
well
as
the
others
,
''
said
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
personage
felt
the
necessity
of
lowering
his
price
a
trifle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
say
ten
thousand
francs
and
I
will
speak

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
to
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
fresh
flash
gleamed
in
the
man
's
eye
.
He
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
must
dine
to-day
,
nevertheless

*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gazed
intently
at
him
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
your
extraordinary

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
not

it

Dier

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thenardier

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
danger
the
porcupine
bristles
up
,
the
beetle
feigns
death
,
the
old
*NL*
guard
forms
in
a
square
;
this
man
burst
into
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
flicked
a
grain
of
dust
from
the
sleeve
of
his
coat
with
a
*NL*
fillip
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
also
Jondrette
the
workman
,
Fabantou
the
comedian
,
Genflot
the
*NL*
poet
,
Don
Alvares
the
Spaniard
,
and
Mistress
Balizard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mistress
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
kept
a
pot-house
at
Montfermeil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pot-house
!
Never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
tell
you
that
your
name
is
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deny
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
you
are
a
rascal
.
Here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Marius
drew
a
bank-note
from
his
pocket
and
flung
it
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
!
Pardon
me
!
five
hundred
francs
!
Monsieur
le
Baron
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
the
man
,
overcome
,
bowed
,
seized
the
note
and
examined
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
hundred
francs
!
''
he
began
again
,
taken
aback
.
And
he
stammered
in
*NL*
a
low
voice
:
``
An
honest
rustler
.
''
-LSB-
69
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Then
brusquely
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
so
be
it
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
``
Let
us
put
ourselves
at
our
ease
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
the
agility
of
a
monkey
,
flinging
back
his
hair
,
tearing
off
*NL*
his
spectacles
,
and
withdrawing
from
his
nose
by
sleight
of
hand
the
two
*NL*
quills
of
which
mention
was
recently
made
,
and
which
the
reader
has
also
*NL*
met
with
on
another
page
of
this
book
,
he
took
off
his
face
as
the
man
*NL*
takes
off
his
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eye
lighted
up
;
his
uneven
brow
,
with
hollows
in
some
places
and
*NL*
bumps
in
others
,
hideously
wrinkled
at
the
top
,
was
laid
bare
,
his
nose
*NL*
had
become
as
sharp
as
a
beak
;
the
fierce
and
sagacious
profile
of
the
*NL*
man
of
prey
reappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
is
infallible
,
''
he
said
in
a
clear
voice
whence
all
*NL*
nasal
twang
had
disappeared
,
``
I
am
Thenardier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
straightened
up
his
crooked
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
for
it
was
really
he
,
was
strangely
surprised
;
he
would
have
*NL*
been
troubled
,
had
he
been
capable
of
such
a
thing
.
He
had
come
to
bring
*NL*
astonishment
,
and
it
was
he
who
had
received
it
.
This
humiliation
had
*NL*
been
worth
five
hundred
francs
to
him
,
and
,
taking
it
all
in
all
,
he
*NL*
accepted
it
;
but
he
was
none
the
less
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beheld
this
Baron
Pontmercy
for
the
first
time
,
and
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
disguise
,
this
Baron
Pontmercy
recognized
him
,
and
recognized
*NL*
him
thoroughly
.
And
not
only
was
this
Baron
perfectly
informed
as
to
*NL*
Thenardier
,
but
he
seemed
well
posted
as
to
Jean
Valjean
.
Who
was
this
*NL*
almost
beardless
young
man
,
who
was
so
glacial
and
so
generous
,
who
knew
*NL*
people
's
names
,
who
knew
all
their
names
,
and
who
opened
his
purse
to
*NL*
them
,
who
bullied
rascals
like
a
judge
,
and
who
paid
them
like
a
dupe
?
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
,
the
reader
will
remember
,
although
he
had
been
Marius
'
*NL*
neighbor
,
had
never
seen
him
,
which
is
not
unusual
in
Paris
;
he
had
*NL*
formerly
,
in
a
vague
way
,
heard
his
daughters
talk
of
a
very
poor
young
*NL*
man
named
Marius
who
lived
in
the
house
.
He
had
written
to
him
,
without
*NL*
knowing
him
,
the
letter
with
which
the
reader
is
acquainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
connection
between
that
Marius
and
M.
le
Baron
Pontmercy
was
possible
*NL*
in
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
name
Pontmercy
,
it
will
be
recalled
that
,
on
the
battlefield
*NL*
of
Waterloo
,
he
had
only
heard
the
last
two
syllables
,
for
which
he
*NL*
always
entertained
the
legitimate
scorn
which
one
owes
to
what
is
merely
*NL*
an
expression
of
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
through
his
daughter
Azelma
,
who
had
started
on
the
scent
of
*NL*
the
married
pair
on
the
16th
of
February
,
and
through
his
own
personal
*NL*
researches
,
he
had
succeeded
in
learning
many
things
,
and
,
from
the
*NL*
depths
of
his
own
gloom
,
he
had
contrived
to
grasp
more
than
one
*NL*
mysterious
clew
.
He
had
discovered
,
by
dint
of
industry
,
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
by
dint
of
induction
,
he
had
guessed
who
the
man
was
whom
he
had
*NL*
encountered
on
a
certain
day
in
the
Grand
Sewer
.
From
the
man
he
had
*NL*
easily
reached
the
name
.
He
knew
that
Madame
la
Baronne
Pontmercy
was
*NL*
Cosette
.
But
he
meant
to
be
discreet
in
that
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Who
was
Cosette
?
He
did
not
know
exactly
himself
.
He
did
,
indeed
,
catch
*NL*
an
inkling
of
illegitimacy
,
the
history
of
Fantine
had
always
seemed
to
*NL*
him
equivocal
;
but
what
was
the
use
of
talking
about
that
?
in
order
to
*NL*
cause
himself
to
be
paid
for
his
silence
?
He
had
,
or
thought
he
had
,
*NL*
better
wares
than
that
for
sale
.
And
,
according
to
all
appearances
,
if
*NL*
he
were
to
come
and
make
to
the
Baron
Pontmercy
this
revelation
--
and
*NL*
without
proof
:
``
Your
wife
is
a
bastard
,
''
the
only
result
would
be
to
*NL*
attract
the
boot
of
the
husband
towards
the
loins
of
the
revealer
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Thenardier
's
point
of
view
,
the
conversation
with
Marius
had
not
*NL*
yet
begun
.
He
ought
to
have
drawn
back
,
to
have
modified
his
strategy
,
*NL*
to
have
abandoned
his
position
,
to
have
changed
his
front
;
but
nothing
*NL*
essential
had
been
compromised
as
yet
,
and
he
had
five
hundred
francs
*NL*
in
his
pocket
.
Moreover
,
he
had
something
decisive
to
say
,
and
,
even
*NL*
against
this
very
well-informed
and
well-armed
Baron
Pontmercy
,
he
felt
*NL*
himself
strong
.
For
men
of
Thenardier
's
nature
,
every
dialogue
is
*NL*
a
combat
.
In
the
one
in
which
he
was
about
to
engage
,
what
was
his
*NL*
situation
?
He
did
not
know
to
whom
he
was
speaking
,
but
he
did
know
of
*NL*
what
he
was
speaking
,
he
made
this
rapid
review
of
his
inner
forces
,
and
*NL*
after
having
said
:
``
I
am
Thenardier
,
''
he
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
become
thoughtful
.
So
he
had
hold
of
Thenardier
at
last
.
*NL*
That
man
whom
he
had
so
greatly
desired
to
find
was
before
him
.
He
could
*NL*
honor
Colonel
Pontmercy
's
recommendation
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
humiliated
that
that
hero
should
have
owned
anything
to
this
*NL*
villain
,
and
that
the
letter
of
change
drawn
from
the
depths
of
the
tomb
*NL*
by
his
father
upon
him
,
Marius
,
had
been
protested
up
to
that
day
.
It
*NL*
also
seemed
to
him
,
in
the
complex
state
of
his
mind
towards
Thenardier
,
*NL*
that
there
was
occasion
to
avenge
the
Colonel
for
the
misfortune
of
*NL*
having
been
saved
by
such
a
rascal
.
In
any
case
,
he
was
content
.
He
*NL*
was
about
to
deliver
the
Colonel
's
shade
from
this
unworthy
creditor
*NL*
at
last
,
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
on
the
point
of
rescuing
his
*NL*
father
's
memory
from
the
debtors
'
prison
.
By
the
side
of
this
duty
there
*NL*
was
another
--
to
elucidate
,
if
possible
,
the
source
of
Cosette
's
fortune
.
*NL*
The
opportunity
appeared
to
present
itself
.
Perhaps
Thenardier
knew
*NL*
something
.
It
might
prove
useful
to
see
the
bottom
of
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
commenced
with
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
had
caused
the
``
honest
rustler
''
to
disappear
in
his
fob
,
and
*NL*
was
gazing
at
Marius
with
a
gentleness
that
was
almost
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
broke
the
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thenardier
,
I
have
told
you
your
name
.
Now
,
would
you
like
to
have
me
*NL*
tell
you
your
secret
--
the
one
that
you
came
here
to
reveal
to
me
?
I
have
*NL*
information
of
my
own
,
also
.
You
shall
see
that
I
know
more
about
it
*NL*
than
you
do
.
Jean
Valjean
,
as
you
have
said
,
is
an
assassin
and
a
thief
.
*NL*
A
thief
,
because
he
robbed
a
wealthy
manufacturer
,
whose
ruin
he
brought
*NL*
about
.
An
assassin
,
because
he
assassinated
police-agent
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
,
sir
,
''
ejaculated
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
make
myself
intelligible
.
In
a
certain
arrondissement
of
the
Pas
*NL*
de
Calais
,
there
was
,
in
1822
,
a
man
who
had
fallen
out
with
justice
,
*NL*
and
who
,
under
the
name
of
M.
Madeleine
,
had
regained
his
status
and
*NL*
rehabilitated
himself
.
This
man
had
become
a
just
man
in
the
full
force
*NL*
of
the
term
.
In
a
trade
,
the
manufacture
of
black
glass
goods
,
he
*NL*
made
the
fortune
of
an
entire
city
.
As
far
as
his
personal
fortune
was
*NL*
concerned
he
made
that
also
,
but
as
a
secondary
matter
,
and
in
some
*NL*
sort
,
by
accident
.
He
was
the
foster-father
of
the
poor
.
He
founded
*NL*
hospitals
,
opened
schools
,
visited
the
sick
,
dowered
young
girls
,
*NL*
supported
widows
,
and
adopted
orphans
;
he
was
like
the
guardian
angel
of
*NL*
the
country
.
He
refused
the
cross
,
he
was
appointed
Mayor
.
A
liberated
*NL*
convict
knew
the
secret
of
a
penalty
incurred
by
this
man
in
former
*NL*
days
;
he
denounced
him
,
and
had
him
arrested
,
and
profited
by
the
arrest
*NL*
to
come
to
Paris
and
cause
the
banker
Laffitte
,
--
I
have
the
fact
from
*NL*
the
cashier
himself
,
--
by
means
of
a
false
signature
,
to
hand
over
to
*NL*
him
the
sum
of
over
half
a
million
which
belonged
to
M.
Madeleine
.
This
*NL*
convict
who
robbed
M.
Madeleine
was
Jean
Valjean
.
As
for
the
other
fact
,
*NL*
you
have
nothing
to
tell
me
about
it
either
.
Jean
Valjean
killed
the
*NL*
agent
Javert
;
he
shot
him
with
a
pistol
.
I
,
the
person
who
is
speaking
*NL*
to
you
,
was

''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
cast
upon
Marius
the
sovereign
glance
of
a
conquered
man
who
*NL*
lays
his
hand
once
more
upon
the
victory
,
and
who
has
just
regained
,
in
*NL*
one
instant
,
all
the
ground
which
he
has
lost
.
But
the
smile
returned
*NL*
instantly
.
The
inferior
's
triumph
in
the
presence
of
his
superior
must
*NL*
be
wheedling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
contented
himself
with
saying
to
Marius
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
we
are
on
the
wrong
track
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
emphasized
this
phrase
by
making
his
bunch
of
seals
execute
an
*NL*
expressive
whirl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
broke
forth
Marius
,
``
do
you
dispute
that
?
These
are
facts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
chimeras
.
The
confidence
with
which
Monsieur
le
Baron
honors
*NL*
me
renders
it
my
duty
to
tell
him
so
.
Truth
and
justice
before
all
*NL*
things
.
I
do
not
like
to
see
folks
accused
unjustly
.
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
did
not
rob
M.
Madeleine
and
Jean
Valjean
did
not
kill
*NL*
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
too
much
!
How
is
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
two
reasons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
they
?
Speak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
first
:
he
did
not
rob
M.
Madeleine
,
because
it
is
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
himself
who
was
M.
Madeleine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
tale
are
you
telling
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
this
is
the
second
:
he
did
not
assassinate
Javert
,
because
the
*NL*
person
who
killed
Javert
was
Javert
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Javert
committed
suicide
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prove
it
!
prove
it
!
''
cried
Marius
beside
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
resumed
,
scanning
his
phrase
after
the
manner
of
the
ancient
*NL*
Alexandrine
measure
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Police-agent-Ja-vert-was-found-drowned-un-der-a-boat-of-the-Pont-au-Change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
prove
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
drew
from
his
pocket
a
large
envelope
of
gray
paper
,
which
*NL*
seemed
to
contain
sheets
folded
in
different
sizes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
my
papers
,
''
he
said
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
in
your
interests
I
desired
to
know
Jean
Valjean
*NL*
thoroughly
.
I
say
that
Jean
Valjean
and
M.
Madeleine
are
one
and
the
*NL*
same
man
,
and
I
say
that
Javert
had
no
other
assassin
than
Javert
.
If
*NL*
I
speak
,
it
is
because
I
have
proofs
.
Not
manuscript
proofs
--
writing
is
*NL*
suspicious
,
handwriting
is
complaisant
,
--
but
printed
proofs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
spoke
,
Thenardier
extracted
from
the
envelope
two
copies
of
*NL*
newspapers
,
yellow
,
faded
,
and
strongly
saturated
with
tobacco
.
One
of
*NL*
these
two
newspapers
,
broken
at
every
fold
and
falling
into
rags
,
seemed
*NL*
much
older
than
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
facts
,
two
proofs
,
''
remarked
Thenardier
.
And
he
offered
the
two
*NL*
newspapers
,
unfolded
,
to
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
is
acquainted
with
these
two
papers
.
One
,
the
most
ancient
,
a
*NL*
number
of
the
Drapeau
Blanc
of
the
25th
of
July
,
1823
,
the
text
of
*NL*
which
can
be
seen
in
the
first
volume
,
established
the
identity
of
M.
*NL*
Madeleine
and
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
,
a
Moniteur
of
the
15th
of
June
,
1832
,
announced
the
suicide
*NL*
of
Javert
,
adding
that
it
appeared
from
a
verbal
report
of
Javert
to
the
*NL*
prefect
that
,
having
been
taken
prisoner
in
the
barricade
of
the
Rue
de
*NL*
la
Chanvrerie
,
he
had
owed
his
life
to
the
magnanimity
of
an
insurgent
*NL*
who
,
holding
him
under
his
pistol
,
had
fired
into
the
air
,
instead
of
*NL*
blowing
out
his
brains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
read
.
He
had
evidence
,
a
certain
date
,
irrefragable
proof
,
these
*NL*
two
newspapers
had
not
been
printed
expressly
for
the
purpose
of
backing
*NL*
up
Thenardier
's
statements
;
the
note
printed
in
the
Moniteur
had
been
an
*NL*
administrative
communication
from
the
Prefecture
of
Police
.
Marius
could
*NL*
not
doubt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
information
of
the
cashier-clerk
had
been
false
,
and
he
himself
had
*NL*
been
deceived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
who
had
suddenly
grown
grand
,
emerged
from
his
cloud
.
*NL*
Marius
could
not
repress
a
cry
of
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
this
unhappy
wretch
is
an
admirable
man
!
the
whole
of
that
*NL*
fortune
really
belonged
to
him
!
he
is
Madeleine
,
the
providence
of
a
*NL*
whole
countryside
!
he
is
Jean
Valjean
,
Javert
's
savior
!
he
is
a
hero
!
he
*NL*
is
a
saint
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
a
saint
,
and
he
's
not
a
hero
!
''
said
Thenardier
.
``
He
's
an
*NL*
assassin
and
a
robber
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
added
,
in
the
tone
of
a
man
who
begins
to
feel
that
he
possesses
*NL*
some
authority
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
be
calm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Robber
,
assassin
--
those
words
which
Marius
thought
had
disappeared
and
*NL*
which
returned
,
fell
upon
him
like
an
ice-cold
shower-bath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Again
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Always
,
''
ejaculated
Thenardier
.
``
Jean
Valjean
did
not
rob
Madeleine
,
*NL*
but
he
is
a
thief
.
He
did
not
kill
Javert
,
but
he
is
a
murderer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
speak
,
''
retorted
Marius
,
``
of
that
miserable
theft
,
committed
*NL*
forty
years
ago
,
and
expiated
,
as
your
own
newspapers
prove
,
by
a
whole
*NL*
life
of
repentance
,
of
self-abnegation
and
of
virtue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
assassination
and
theft
,
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
and
I
repeat
that
I
*NL*
am
speaking
of
actual
facts
.
What
I
have
to
reveal
to
you
is
absolutely
*NL*
unknown
.
It
belongs
to
unpublished
matter
.
And
perhaps
you
will
find
in
*NL*
it
the
source
of
the
fortune
so
skilfully
presented
to
Madame
la
Baronne
*NL*
by
Jean
Valjean
.
I
say
skilfully
,
because
,
by
a
gift
of
that
nature
it
*NL*
would
not
be
so
very
unskilful
to
slip
into
an
honorable
house
whose
*NL*
comforts
one
would
then
share
,
and
,
at
the
same
stroke
,
to
conceal
one
's
*NL*
crime
,
and
to
enjoy
one
's
theft
,
to
bury
one
's
name
and
to
create
for
*NL*
oneself
a
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
might
interrupt
you
at
this
point
,
''
said
Marius
,
``
but
go
on
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
I
will
tell
you
all
,
leaving
the
recompense
to
your
*NL*
generosity

This
secret
is
worth
massive
gold
.
You
will
say
to
me
:
`
Why
*NL*
do
not
you
apply
to
Jean
Valjean
?
'
For
a
very
simple
reason
;
I
know
*NL*
that
he
has
stripped
himself
,
and
stripped
himself
in
your
favor
,
and
I
*NL*
consider
the
combination
ingenious
;
but
he
has
no
longer
a
son

he
would
*NL*
show
me
his
empty
hands
,
and
,
since
I
am
in
need
of
some
money
for
*NL*
my
trip
to
la
Joya
,
I
prefer
you
,
you
who
have
it
all
,
to
him
who
has
*NL*
nothing
.
I
am
a
little
fatigued
,
permit
me
to
take
a
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
seated
himself
and
motioned
to
him
to
do
the
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
installed
himself
on
a
tufted
chair
,
picked
up
his
two
*NL*
newspapers
,
thrust
them
back
into
their
envelope
,
and
murmured
as
he
*NL*
pecked
at
the
Drapeau
Blanc
with
his
nail
:
``
It
cost
me
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
to
get
this
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
done
he
crossed
his
legs
and
stretched
himself
out
on
the
back
of
*NL*
the
chair
,
an
attitude
characteristic
of
people
who
are
sure
of
what
*NL*
they
are
saying
,
then
he
entered
upon
his
subject
gravely
,
emphasizing
*NL*
his
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
on
the
6th
of
June
,
1832
,
about
a
year
ago
,
on
the
*NL*
day
of
the
insurrection
,
a
man
was
in
the
Grand
Sewer
of
Paris
,
at
the
*NL*
point
where
the
sewer
enters
the
Seine
,
between
the
Pont
des
Invalides
*NL*
and
the
Pont
de
Jena
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
abruptly
drew
his
chair
closer
to
that
of
Thenardier
.
Thenardier
*NL*
noticed
this
movement
and
continued
with
the
deliberation
of
an
orator
*NL*
who
holds
his
interlocutor
and
who
feels
his
adversary
palpitating
under
*NL*
his
words
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
man
,
forced
to
conceal
himself
,
and
for
reasons
,
moreover
,
which
*NL*
are
foreign
to
politics
,
had
adopted
the
sewer
as
his
domicile
and
had
*NL*
a
key
to
it
.
It
was
,
I
repeat
,
on
the
6th
of
June
;
it
might
have
been
*NL*
eight
o'clock
in
the
evening
.
The
man
hears
a
noise
in
the
sewer
.
*NL*
Greatly
surprised
,
he
hides
himself
and
lies
in
wait
.
It
was
the
sound
*NL*
of
footsteps
,
some
one
was
walking
in
the
dark
,
and
coming
in
his
*NL*
direction
.
Strange
to
say
,
there
was
another
man
in
the
sewer
besides
*NL*
himself
.
The
grating
of
the
outlet
from
the
sewer
was
not
far
off
.
*NL*
A
little
light
which
fell
through
it
permitted
him
to
recognize
the
*NL*
newcomer
,
and
to
see
that
the
man
was
carrying
something
on
his
back
.
*NL*
He
was
walking
in
a
bent
attitude
.
The
man
who
was
walking
in
a
bent
*NL*
attitude
was
an
ex-convict
,
and
what
he
was
dragging
on
his
shoulders
*NL*
was
a
corpse
.
Assassination
caught
in
the
very
act
,
if
ever
there
was
*NL*
such
a
thing
.
As
for
the
theft
,
that
is
understood
;
one
does
not
kill
*NL*
a
man
gratis
.
This
convict
was
on
his
way
to
fling
the
body
into
the
*NL*
river
.
One
fact
is
to
be
noticed
,
that
before
reaching
the
exit
*NL*
grating
,
this
convict
,
who
had
come
a
long
distance
in
the
sewer
,
must
,
*NL*
necessarily
,
have
encountered
a
frightful
quagmire
where
it
seems
as
*NL*
though
he
might
have
left
the
body
,
but
the
sewermen
would
have
found
*NL*
the
assassinated
man
the
very
next
day
,
while
at
work
on
the
quagmire
,
*NL*
and
that
did
not
suit
the
assassin
's
plans
.
He
had
preferred
to
*NL*
traverse
that
quagmire
with
his
burden
,
and
his
exertions
must
have
been
*NL*
terrible
,
for
it
is
impossible
to
risk
one
's
life
more
completely
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
understand
how
he
could
have
come
out
of
that
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
'
chair
approached
still
nearer
.
Thenardier
took
advantage
of
this
*NL*
to
draw
a
long
breath
.
He
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
a
sewer
is
not
the
Champ
de
Mars
.
One
lacks
*NL*
everything
there
,
even
room
.
When
two
men
are
there
,
they
must
meet
.
*NL*
That
is
what
happened
.
The
man
domiciled
there
and
the
passer-by
were
*NL*
forced
to
bid
each
other
good-day
,
greatly
to
the
regret
of
both
.
The
*NL*
passer-by
said
to
the
inhabitant
:
--
``
You
see
what
I
have
on
my
back
,
I
*NL*
must
get
out
,
you
have
the
key
,
give
it
to
me
.
''
That
convict
was
a
man
*NL*
of
terrible
strength
.
There
was
no
way
of
refusing
.
Nevertheless
,
the
*NL*
man
who
had
the
key
parleyed
,
simply
to
gain
time
.
He
examined
the
dead
*NL*
man
,
but
he
could
see
nothing
,
except
that
the
latter
was
young
,
well
*NL*
dressed
,
with
the
air
of
being
rich
,
and
all
disfigured
with
blood
.
*NL*
While
talking
,
the
man
contrived
to
tear
and
pull
off
behind
,
without
*NL*
the
assassin
perceiving
it
,
a
bit
of
the
assassinated
man
's
coat
.
A
*NL*
document
for
conviction
,
you
understand
;
a
means
of
recovering
the
trace
*NL*
of
things
and
of
bringing
home
the
crime
to
the
criminal
.
He
put
*NL*
this
document
for
conviction
in
his
pocket
.
After
which
he
opened
the
*NL*
grating
,
made
the
man
go
out
with
his
embarrassment
on
his
back
,
closed
*NL*
the
grating
again
,
and
ran
off
,
not
caring
to
be
mixed
up
with
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
adventure
and
above
all
,
not
wishing
to
be
present
*NL*
when
the
assassin
threw
the
assassinated
man
into
the
river
.
Now
you
*NL*
comprehend
.
The
man
who
was
carrying
the
corpse
was
Jean
Valjean
;
the
*NL*
one
who
had
the
key
is
speaking
to
you
at
this
moment
;
and
the
piece
of
*NL*
the
coat
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
completed
his
phrase
by
drawing
from
his
pocket
,
and
holding
,
*NL*
on
a
level
with
his
eyes
,
nipped
between
his
two
thumbs
and
his
two
*NL*
forefingers
,
a
strip
of
torn
black
cloth
,
all
covered
with
dark
spots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
had
sprung
to
his
feet
,
pale
,
hardly
able
to
draw
his
breath
,
*NL*
with
his
eyes
riveted
on
the
fragment
of
black
cloth
,
and
,
without
*NL*
uttering
a
word
,
without
taking
his
eyes
from
that
fragment
,
he
*NL*
retreated
to
the
wall
and
fumbled
with
his
right
hand
along
the
wall
for
*NL*
a
key
which
was
in
the
lock
of
a
cupboard
near
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
the
key
,
opened
the
cupboard
,
plunged
his
arm
into
it
without
*NL*
looking
,
and
without
his
frightened
gaze
quitting
the
rag
which
*NL*
Thenardier
still
held
outspread
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Thenardier
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
,
I
have
the
strongest
of
reasons
for
believing
that
*NL*
the
assassinated
young
man
was
an
opulent
stranger
lured
into
a
trap
by
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
and
the
bearer
of
an
enormous
sum
of
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
young
man
was
myself
,
and
here
is
the
coat
!
''
cried
Marius
,
and
he
*NL*
flung
upon
the
floor
an
old
black
coat
all
covered
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
snatching
the
fragment
from
the
hands
of
Thenardier
,
he
crouched
*NL*
down
over
the
coat
,
and
laid
the
torn
morsel
against
the
tattered
skirt
.
*NL*
The
rent
fitted
exactly
,
and
the
strip
completed
the
coat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thenardier
was
petrified
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
what
he
thought
:
``
I
'm
struck
all
of
a
heap
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
rose
to
his
feet
trembling
,
despairing
,
radiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumbled
in
his
pocket
and
stalked
furiously
to
Thenardier
,
presenting
*NL*
to
him
and
almost
thrusting
in
his
face
his
fist
filled
with
bank-notes
*NL*
for
five
hundred
and
a
thousand
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
an
infamous
wretch
!
you
are
a
liar
,
a
calumniator
,
a
villain
.
*NL*
You
came
to
accuse
that
man
,
you
have
only
justified
him
;
you
wanted
to
*NL*
ruin
him
,
you
have
only
succeeded
in
glorifying
him
.
And
it
is
you
who
*NL*
are
the
thief
!
And
it
is
you
who
are
the
assassin
!
I
saw
you
,
Thenardier
*NL*
Jondrette
,
in
that
lair
on
the
Rue
de
l'Hopital
.
I
know
enough
about
*NL*
you
to
send
you
to
the
galleys
and
even
further
if
I
choose
.
Here
are
a
*NL*
thousand
francs
,
bully
that
you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
flung
a
thousand
franc
note
at
Thenardier
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Jondrette
Thenardier
,
vile
rascal
!
Let
this
serve
you
as
a
lesson
,
*NL*
you
dealer
in
second-hand
secrets
,
merchant
of
mysteries
,
rummager
of
*NL*
the
shadows
,
wretch
!
Take
these
five
hundred
francs
and
get
out
of
here
!
*NL*
Waterloo
protects
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waterloo
!
''
growled
Thenardier
,
pocketing
the
five
hundred
francs
along
*NL*
with
the
thousand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
assassin
!
You
there
saved
the
life
of
a
Colonel
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
General
,
''
said
Thenardier
,
elevating
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
a
Colonel
!
''
repeated
Marius
in
a
rage
.
``
I
would
n't
give
a

penny
*NL*
for
a

And
you
come
here
to
commit
infamies

I
tell
you
that
*NL*
you
have
committed
all
crimes

Go

disappear

Only
be
happy

that
is
all
*NL*
that
I

Ah

here
are
three
thousand

Take

them

You

depart
to-morrow

for
America

with
your

for
your

is
dead

you
abominable
liar

I
shall
watch
over
your
*NL*
departure
,
you
ruffian
,
and
at
that
moment
I
will
count
out
to
you
*NL*
twenty
thousand
francs
.
Go
get
yourself
hung
elsewhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Monsieur
le
Baron
!
''
replied
Thenardier
,
bowing
to
the
very
earth
,
*NL*
``
eternal
gratitude
.
''
And
Thenardier
left
the
room
,
understanding
*NL*
nothing
,
stupefied
and
delighted
with
this
sweet
crushing
beneath
sacks
*NL*
of
gold
,
and
with
that
thunder
which
had
burst
forth
over
his
head
in
*NL*
bank-bills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Struck
by
lightning
he
was
,
but
he
was
also
content
;
and
he
would
*NL*
have
been
greatly
angered
had
he
had
a
lightning
rod
to
ward
off
such
*NL*
lightning
as
that
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
us
finish
with
this
man
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
after
the
events
which
we
are
at
this
moment
narrating
,
he
set
*NL*
out
,
thanks
to
Marius
'
care
,
for
America
under
a
false
name
,
with
his
*NL*
daughter
Azelma
,
furnished
with
a
draft
on
New
York
for
twenty
thousand
*NL*
francs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moral
wretchedness
of
Thenardier
,
the
bourgeois
who
had
missed
*NL*
his
vocation
,
was
irremediable
.
He
was
in
America
what
he
had
been
in
*NL*
Europe
.
Contact
with
an
evil
man
sometimes
suffices
to
corrupt
a
good
*NL*
action
and
to
cause
evil
things
to
spring
from
it
.
With
Marius
'
money
,
*NL*
Thenardier
set
up
as
a
slave-dealer
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
Thenardier
had
left
the
house
,
Marius
rushed
to
the
garden
,
*NL*
where
Cosette
was
still
walking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
Cosette
!
''
he
cried
.
``
Come
!
come
quick
!
Let
us
go
.
Basque
,
a
*NL*
carriage
!
Cosette
,
come
.
Ah
!
My
God
!
It
was
he
who
saved
my
life
!
Let
us
*NL*
not
lose
a
minute
!
Put
on
your
shawl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
thought
him
mad
and
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
breathe
,
he
laid
his
hand
on
his
heart
to
restrain
its
*NL*
throbbing
.
He
paced
back
and
forth
with
huge
strides
,
he
embraced
*NL*
Cosette
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Cosette
!
I
am
an
unhappy
wretch
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
bewildered
.
He
began
to
catch
a
glimpse
in
Jean
Valjean
of
*NL*
some
indescribably
lofty
and
melancholy
figure
.
An
unheard-of
virtue
,
*NL*
supreme
and
sweet
,
humble
in
its
immensity
,
appeared
to
him
.
The
convict
*NL*
was
transfigured
into
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
was
dazzled
by
this
prodigy
.
He
did
not
know
precisely
what
he
*NL*
beheld
,
but
it
was
grand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
,
a
hackney-carriage
stood
in
front
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
helped
Cosette
in
and
darted
in
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Driver
,
''
said
he
,
``
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
Number
7
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
what
happiness
!
''
ejaculated
Cosette
.
``
Rue
de
l'Homme
Arme
,
I
did
*NL*
not
dare
to
speak
to
you
of
that
.
We
are
going
to
see
M.
Jean

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thy
father
!
Cosette
,
thy
father
more
than
ever

Cosette
,
I
guess
it
.
*NL*
You
told
me
that
you
had
never
received
the
letter
that
I
sent
you
by
*NL*
Gavroche
.
It
must
have
fallen
into
his
hands
.
Cosette
,
he
went
to
the
*NL*
barricade
to
save
me
.
As
it
is
a
necessity
with
him
to
be
an
angel
,
he
*NL*
saved
others
also
;
he
saved
Javert
.
He
rescued
me
from
that
gulf
to
give
*NL*
me
to
you
.
He
carried
me
on
his
back
through
that
frightful
sewer
.
Ah
!
I
*NL*
am
a
monster
of
ingratitude
.
Cosette
,
after
having
been
your
providence
,
*NL*
he
became
mine
.
Just
imagine
,
there
was
a
terrible
quagmire
enough
to
*NL*
drown
one
a
hundred
times
over
,
to
drown
one
in
mire
.
Cosette
!
he
made
*NL*
me
traverse
it
.
I
was
unconscious
;
I
saw
nothing
,
I
heard
nothing
,
I
*NL*
could
know
nothing
of
my
own
adventure
.
We
are
going
to
bring
him
back
,
*NL*
to
take
him
with
us
,
whether
he
is
willing
or
not
,
he
shall
never
leave
*NL*
us
again
.
If
only
he
is
at
home
!
Provided
only
that
we
can
find
him
,
*NL*
I
will
pass
the
rest
of
my
life
in
venerating
him
.
Yes
,
that
is
how
it
*NL*
should
be
,
do
you
see
,
Cosette
?
Gavroche
must
have
delivered
my
letter
*NL*
to
him
.
All
is
explained
.
You
understand

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
did
not
understand
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right

she
said
to
him

*NL*
Meanwhile
the
carriage
rolled
on

CHAPTER
V
--
A
NIGHT
BEHIND
WHICH
THERE
IS
DAY
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
round
at
the
knock
which
he
heard
on
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
''
he
said
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
Marius
made
their
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
rushed
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
remained
on
the
threshold
,
leaning
against
the
jamb
of
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sat
erect
in
his
chair
,
his
arms
outstretched
and
trembling
,
*NL*
haggard
,
livid
,
gloomy
,
an
immense
joy
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
stifling
with
emotion
,
fell
upon
Jean
Valjean
's
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
overcome
,
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
!
she
!
you
!
Madame
!
it
is
thou
!
Ah
!
my
God
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
pressed
close
in
Cosette
's
arms
,
he
exclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
thou
!
thou
art
here
!
Thou
dost
pardon
me
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
,
lowering
his
eyelids
,
in
order
to
keep
his
tears
from
flowing
,
*NL*
took
a
step
forward
and
murmured
between
lips
convulsively
contracted
to
*NL*
repress
his
sobs
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
also
,
you
pardon
me
!
''
Jean
Valjean
said
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
could
find
no
words
,
and
Jean
Valjean
added
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
tore
off
her
shawl
and
tossed
her
hat
on
the
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
embarrasses
me
,
''
said
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
seating
herself
on
the
old
man
's
knees
,
she
put
aside
his
white
*NL*
locks
with
an
adorable
movement
,
and
kissed
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
,
bewildered
,
let
her
have
her
own
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
,
who
only
understood
in
a
very
confused
manner
,
redoubled
her
*NL*
caresses
,
as
though
she
desired
to
pay
Marius
'
debt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupid
people
are
!
I
thought
that
I
should
never
see
her
again
.
*NL*
Imagine
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
at
the
very
moment
when
you
entered
,
I
*NL*
was
saying
to
myself
:
`
All
is
over
.
Here
is
her
little
gown
,
I
am
a
*NL*
miserable
man
,
I
shall
never
see
Cosette
again
,
'
and
I
was
saying
that
*NL*
at
the
very
moment
when
you
were
mounting
the
stairs
.
Was
not
I
an
*NL*
idiot
?
Just
see
how
idiotic
one
can
be
!
One
reckons
without
the
good
*NL*
God
.
The
good
God
says
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
fancy
that
you
are
about
to
be
abandoned

stupid

No

No

things

will
not
go
so
.
Come
,
there
is
a
good
man
yonder
who
is
in
need
of
an
*NL*
angel
.
'
And
the
angel
comes
,
and
one
sees
one
's
Cosette
again
!
and
one
*NL*
sees
one
's
little
Cosette
once
more
!
Ah
!
I
was
very
unhappy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
he
could
not
speak
,
then
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
really
needed
to
see
Cosette
a
little
bit
now
and
then
.
A
heart
needs
*NL*
a
bone
to
gnaw
.
But
I
was
perfectly
conscious
that
I
was
in
the
way
.
I
*NL*
gave
myself
reasons
:
`
They
do
not
want
you
,
keep
in
your
own
course

*NL*
one
has
not
the
right
to
cling
eternally

'
Ah
!
God
be
praised
,
I
see
her
*NL*
once
more
!
Dost
thou
know
,
Cosette
,
thy
husband
is
very
handsome
?
Ah
!
*NL*
what
a
pretty
embroidered
collar
thou
hast
on
,
luckily
.
I
am
fond
of
*NL*
that
pattern

It
was
thy
husband
who
chose
it
,
was
it
not

And
then
,
*NL*
thou
shouldst
have
some
cashmere
shawls

Let
me
call
her
thou

Monsieur

Pontmercy

It
will
not
be
for
long

*NL*
*NL*
And
Cosette
began
again
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
wicked
of
you
to
have
left
us
like
that
!
Where
did
you
go

Why
have

you
stayed
away
so
long
?
Formerly
your
journeys
only
lasted
three
or
*NL*
four
days

I
sent
Nicolette
,
the
answer
always
was
:

How

long
have
you
been
back

Why

you
not

Ah

what

he
has
been
ill

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
are
here

Monsieur

repeated
Jean
*NL*
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
word
which
Jean
Valjean
had
just
uttered
once
more
,
all
that
was
*NL*
swelling
Marius
'
heart
found
vent

*NL*
*NL*
He
burst
forth
:

*NL*
``
Cosette
,
do
you
hear
?
he
has
come

that

he
asks
my

you
know
what
he
has
done

what

he
done

He

sacrificed

Behold

He
carried

away

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush

hush

said
Jean
Valjean
in
a
low
voice
.
``
Why
tell
all
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
!

cried
Marius
with
a
wrath
in
which
there
was
veneration
,
``
why
*NL*
did
you
not
tell
it
to
me
?
It
is
your
own
fault

too

You
save
people

*NL*
lives
,
and
you
conceal
it
from
them
!
You
do
more
,
under
the
pretext
of
*NL*
unmasking
yourself
,
you
calumniate
yourself
.
It
is
frightful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
the
truth

''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

''
retorted
Marius
,
``
the
truth
is
the
whole
truth

and
that
you
did
*NL*
not
tell

You
were
Monsieur
Madeleine

why
not
have
said
so
?
You
saved
*NL*
Javert
,
why
not
have
said
so
?
I
owed
my
life
to
you

why
not
have
said
*NL*
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
thought
as
you
do

I
thought
that
you
were
in

It
*NL*
was
necessary
that
I
should
go
away

If
you
had
known
about
that
affair
,
*NL*
of
the
sewer
,
you
would
have
made
me
remain
near
you

I
was
therefore
*NL*
forced
to
hold
my
peace

If
I
had
spoken

it
would
have
caused
*NL*
embarrassment
in
every
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
have
embarrassed
what

embarrassed
whom

retorted
Marius
.
``
Do
*NL*
you
think

off

Ah

good
heavens
!
when
I
reflect
that
it
was
by
an
accident
that
I
have
*NL*
learned
all
this
.
You
form
a
part
of
ourselves

You
are
her
father
,
*NL*
and
mine

You
shall
not
pass
another
day
in
this
dreadful
house

Do
not
*NL*
imagine
that
you
will
be
here
to-morrow

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow

''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
I
shall
not
be
here

but
I
shall
not

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean

replied
Marius
.
``
Ah

come
now

we

*NL*
``

Cosette

``
We

a

If

employ
force

*NL*
*NL*
And
she
laughingly
made
a
movement
to
lift
the
old
man
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
chamber
still
stands
ready
in
our
house

she
went
on

``

there

The
walks
are
sanded
with
river
sand

there
are
tiny
violet

shells

You

eat

I
water
them

And
no

under

Republic

*NL*

they

Marius

The
programme
is
changed
.
If
*NL*
you
only
knew
,
father
,
I
have
had
a
sorrow
,
there
was
a
robin
redbreast
*NL*
which
had
made
her
nest
in
a
hole
in
the
wall
,
and
a
horrible
cat
ate
*NL*
her
.
My
poor
,
pretty
,
little
robin
red-breast
which
used
to
put
her
head
*NL*
out
of
her
window
and
look
at
me
!
I
cried
over
it
.
I
should
have
liked
*NL*
to
kill
the
cat

But
now
nobody
cries
any
more
.
Everybody
laughs
,
*NL*
everybody
is
happy

You
are
going

come
with
us

How
delighted
*NL*
grandfather
will
be
!
You
shall
have
your
plot
in
the

you
shall

cultivate
it
,
and
we
shall
see
whether
your
strawberries
are
as
fine
as
*NL*
mine
.
And
,
then
,
I
shall
do
everything
that
you
wish
,
and
then
,
you
will
*NL*
obey
me
prettily
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
listened
to
her
without
hearing
her
.
He
heard
the
music
of
*NL*
her
voice
rather
than
the
sense
of
her
words
;
one
of
those
large
tears
*NL*
which
are
the
sombre
pearls
of
the
soul
welled
up
slowly
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
proof
that
God
is
good
is
that
she
is
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
!
''
said
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
continued
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
quite
true
that
it
would
be
charming
for
us
to
live
together

*NL*
Their
trees
are
full

birds

I
would
walk
with
Cosette

It
is
sweet
to

be
among
living
people

bid
each
other
`
good-day

who
call
to
each

other
in
the
garden

People
see
each

from
early
morning

We
*NL*
should
each
cultivate

little
corner

She

I

gather
my
roses

That
would
be
charming

*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
said
gently
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tear
did
not
fall
,
it
retreated
,
and
Jean
Valjean
replaced
it
with
a
*NL*
smile

*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
took
both
the
old
man
's
hands
in
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
God

said
she
,
``
your

are
still
colder

Are
you

ill

Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

No

replied
Jean
Valjean

``
I
am
very
well

Only

*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
to
die
presently

''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
Marius
shuddered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
die
!
''
exclaimed
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
that
is
nothing

said
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
breath
,
smiled
and
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cosette
,
thou
wert
talking
to
me

go
on

Speak

so

hear
thy

*NL*
*NL*
Marius
gazed
at
the
old
man
in
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
uttered
a
heartrending
cry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father

my

*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
raised
his
head
towards
her
with
adoration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

yes
,
forbid
me
to
die

Who
knows
?
Perhaps
I
shall
obey

I
was
on
*NL*
the
verge
of
dying
when
you
came
.
That
stopped
me
,
it
seemed
to
me
that
*NL*
I
was
born
again

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
full
of
strength

life

cried
Marius
.
``
Do
you
imagine

can
die

It

I

ask

You
are
going

live

to
live
with
us

and
to
live
a
long
time

We
take
possession

of
you
once
more

There
are
two

us
here
who
will
henceforth
have
no
*NL*
other
thought
than
your
happiness

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
''
resumed
Cosette
,
all
bathed
in
tears
,
``
that
Marius
says
that
*NL*
you
shall
not
die

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
continued
to
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
if
you
were
to
take
possession
of
me
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
would
*NL*
that
make
me
other
than
I
am
?
No
,
God
has
thought
like
you
and
myself
,
*NL*
and
he
does
not
change
his
mind
;
it
is
useful
for
me
to
go
.
Death
is
*NL*
a
good
arrangement
.
God
knows
better
than
we
what
we
need
.
May
you
be
*NL*
happy
,
may
Monsieur
Pontmercy
have
Cosette
,
may
youth
wed
the
morning
,
*NL*
may
there
be
around
you
,
my
children

lilacs
and
nightingales
;
may
your
*NL*
life
be
a
beautiful

sunny
lawn

may
all
the
enchantments
of
heaven
fill
*NL*
your
souls

now
let
me
,
who
am
good

nothing

die

it
is
certain
*NL*
that
all
this
is
right

Come

be
reasonable

nothing
is
possible
now

I
*NL*
am
fully
conscious
that
all
is
over

And
then
,
last
night
,
I
drank
that
*NL*
whole
jug
of
water
.
How
good
thy
husband
is
,
Cosette
!
Thou
art
much
*NL*
better
off
with
him
than
with
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
noise
became
audible
at
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
doctor
entering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-day
,
and
farewell
,
doctor
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
``
Here
are
my
poor
*NL*
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Marius
stepped
up
to
the
doctor
.
He
addressed
to
him
only
this
single
*NL*
word
:
``
Monsieur
?
...
''
But
his
manner
of
pronouncing
it
contained
a
*NL*
complete
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
replied
to
the
question
by
an
expressive
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
things
are
not
agreeable
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
,
``
that
is
no
*NL*
reason
for
being
unjust
towards
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
ensued
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
breasts
were
oppressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
turned
to
Cosette
.
He
began
to
gaze
at
her
as
though
he
*NL*
wished
to
retain
her
features
for
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
depths
of
the
shadow
into
which
he
had
already
descended
,
ecstasy
*NL*
was
still
possible
to
him
when
gazing
at
Cosette
.
The
reflection
of
that
*NL*
sweet
face
lighted
up
his
pale
visage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
doctor
felt
of
his
pulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
it
was
you
that
he
wanted
!
''
he
murmured
,
looking
at
Cosette
and
*NL*
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
bending
down
to
Marius
'
ear
,
he
added
in
a
very
low
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
surveyed
the
doctor
and
Marius
serenely
,
almost
without
*NL*
ceasing
to
gaze
at
Cosette
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
barely
articulate
words
were
heard
to
issue
from
his
mouth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
nothing
to
die
;
it
is
dreadful
not
to
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
at
once
he
rose
to
his
feet
.
These
accesses
of
strength
are
*NL*
sometimes
the
sign
of
the
death
agony
.
He
walked
with
a
firm
step
to
*NL*
the
wall
,
thrusting
aside
Marius
and
the
doctor
who
tried
to
help
him
,
*NL*
detached
from
the
wall
a
little
copper
crucifix
which
was
suspended
*NL*
there
,
and
returned
to
his
seat
with
all
the
freedom
of
movement
of
*NL*
perfect
health
,
and
said
in
a
loud
voice
,
as
he
laid
the
crucifix
on
the
*NL*
table
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Behold
the
great
martyr
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
his
chest
sank
in
,
his
head
wavered
,
as
though
the
intoxication
of
*NL*
the
tomb
were
seizing
hold
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hands
,
which
rested
on
his
knees
,
began
to
press
their
nails
into
*NL*
the
stuff
of
his
trousers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
supported
his
shoulders
,
and
sobbed
,
and
tried
to
speak
to
him
,
*NL*
but
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
words
mingled
with
that
mournful
saliva
which
accompanies
*NL*
tears
,
they
distinguished
words
like
the
following
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
do
not
leave
us
.
Is
it
possible
that
we
have
found
you
only
to
*NL*
lose
you
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
be
said
that
agony
writhes
.
It
goes
,
comes
,
advances
towards
*NL*
the
sepulchre
,
and
returns
towards
life
.
There
is
groping
in
the
action
*NL*
of
dying
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
rallied
after
this
semi-swoon
,
shook
his
brow
as
though
*NL*
to
make
the
shadows
fall
away
from
it
and
became
almost
perfectly
lucid
*NL*
once
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
fold
of
Cosette
's
sleeve
and
kissed
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
coming
back
!
doctor
,
he
is
coming
back
,
''
cried
Marius
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
good
,
both
of
you
,
''
said
Jean
Valjean
.
``
I
am
going
to
tell
you
*NL*
what
has
caused
me
pain
.
What
has
pained
me
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
is
that
*NL*
you
have
not
been
willing
to
touch
that
money
.
That
money
really
belongs
*NL*
to
your
wife
.
I
will
explain
to
you
,
my
children
,
and
for
that
reason
,
*NL*
also
,
I
am
glad
to
see
you
.
Black
jet
comes
from
England
,
white
jet
*NL*
comes
from
Norway
.
All
this
is
in
this
paper
,
which
you
will
read
.
For
*NL*
bracelets
,
I
invented
a
way
of
substituting
for
slides
of
soldered
sheet
*NL*
iron
,
slides
of
iron
laid
together
.
It
is
prettier
,
better
and
less
*NL*
costly
.
You
will
understand
how
much
money
can
be
made
in
that
way
.
So
*NL*
Cosette
's
fortune
is
really
hers
.
I
give
you
these
details
,
in
order
*NL*
that
your
mind
may
be
set
at
rest

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
portress
had
come
upstairs
and
was
gazing
in
at
the
half-open
door
.
*NL*
The
doctor
dismissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
could
not
prevent
this
zealous
woman
from
exclaiming
to
the
dying
*NL*
man
before
she
disappeared
:
``
Would
you
like
a
priest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
had
one
,
''
replied
Jean
Valjean
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
his
finger
he
seemed
to
indicate
a
point
above
his
head
where
*NL*
one
would
have
said
that
he
saw
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
probable
,
in
fact
,
that
the
Bishop
was
present
at
this
death
*NL*
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
gently
slipped
a
pillow
under
his
loins
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
resumed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
no
fear
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
I
adjure
you
.
The
six
hundred
*NL*
thousand
francs
really
belong
to
Cosette
.
My
life
will
have
been
wasted
*NL*
if
you
do
not
enjoy
them
!
We
managed
to
do
very
well
with
those
glass
*NL*
goods
.
We
rivalled
what
is
called
Berlin
jewellery
.
However
,
we
could
*NL*
not
equal
the
black
glass
of
England
.
A
gross
,
which
contains
twelve
*NL*
hundred
very
well
cut
grains
,
only
costs
three
francs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
being
who
is
dear
to
us
is
on
the
point
of
death
,
we
gaze
upon
*NL*
him
with
a
look
which
clings
convulsively
to
him
and
which
would
fain
*NL*
hold
him
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
gave
her
hand
to
Marius
,
and
both
,
mute
with
anguish
,
not
*NL*
knowing
what
to
say
to
the
dying
man
,
stood
trembling
and
despairing
*NL*
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jean
Valjean
sank
moment
by
moment
.
He
was
failing
;
he
was
drawing
near
*NL*
to
the
gloomy
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
breath
had
become
intermittent
;
a
little
rattling
interrupted
it
.
*NL*
He
found
some
difficulty
in
moving
his
forearm
,
his
feet
had
lost
all
*NL*
movement
,
and
in
proportion
as
the
wretchedness
of
limb
and
feebleness
*NL*
of
body
increased
,
all
the
majesty
of
his
soul
was
displayed
and
spread
*NL*
over
his
brow
.
The
light
of
the
unknown
world
was
already
visible
in
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
face
paled
and
smiled
.
Life
was
no
longer
there
,
it
was
something
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
breath
sank
,
his
glance
grew
grander
.
He
was
a
corpse
on
which
the
*NL*
wings
could
be
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
a
sign
to
Cosette
to
draw
near
,
then
to
Marius
;
the
last
minute
*NL*
of
the
last
hour
had
,
evidently
,
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
speak
to
them
in
a
voice
so
feeble
that
it
seemed
to
come
*NL*
from
a
distance
,
and
one
would
have
said
that
a
wall
now
rose
between
*NL*
them
and
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Draw
near
,
draw
near
,
both
of
you
.
I
love
you
dearly
.
Oh
!
how
good
it
*NL*
is
to
die
like
this
!
And
thou
lovest
me
also
,
my
Cosette
.
I
knew
well
*NL*
that
thou
still
felt
friendly
towards
thy
poor
old
man
.
How
kind
it
was
*NL*
of
thee
to
place
that
pillow
under
my
loins
!
Thou
wilt
weep
for
me
a
*NL*
little
,
wilt
thou
not
?
Not
too
much
.
I
do
not
wish
thee
to
have
any
real
*NL*
griefs
.
You
must
enjoy
yourselves
a
great
deal
,
my
children
.
I
forgot
*NL*
to
tell
you
that
the
profit
was
greater
still
on
the
buckles
without
*NL*
tongues
than
on
all
the
rest
.
A
gross
of
a
dozen
dozens
cost
ten
francs
*NL*
and
sold
for
sixty
.
It
really
was
a
good
business
.
So
there
is
no
*NL*
occasion
for
surprise
at
the
six
hundred
thousand
francs
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Pontmercy
.
It
is
honest
money
.
You
may
be
rich
with
a
tranquil
mind
.
*NL*
Thou
must
have
a
carriage
,
a
box
at
the
theatres
now
and
then
,
and
*NL*
handsome
ball
dresses
,
my
Cosette
,
and
then
,
thou
must
give
good
dinners
*NL*
to
thy
friends
,
and
be
very
happy
.
I
was
writing
to
Cosette
a
while
ago
.
*NL*
She
will
find
my
letter
.
I
bequeath
to
her
the
two
candlesticks
which
*NL*
stand
on
the
chimney-piece
.
They
are
of
silver
,
but
to
me
they
are
gold
,
*NL*
they
are
diamonds
;
they
change
candles
which
are
placed
in
them
into
*NL*
wax-tapers
.
I
do
not
know
whether
the
person
who
gave
them
to
me
is
*NL*
pleased
with
me
yonder
on
high
.
I
have
done
what
I
could
.
My
children
,
*NL*
you
will
not
forget
that
I
am
a
poor
man
,
you
will
have
me
buried
in
the
*NL*
first
plot
of
earth
that
you
find
,
under
a
stone
to
mark
the
spot
.
This
*NL*
is
my
wish
.
No
name
on
the
stone
.
If
Cosette
cares
to
come
for
a
little
*NL*
while
now
and
then
,
it
will
give
me
pleasure
.
And
you
too
,
Monsieur
*NL*
Pontmercy
.
I
must
admit
that
I
have
not
always
loved
you
.
I
ask
your
*NL*
pardon
for
that
.
Now
she
and
you
form
but
one
for
me
.
I
feel
very
*NL*
grateful
to
you
.
I
am
sure
that
you
make
Cosette
happy
.
If
you
only
*NL*
knew
,
Monsieur
Pontmercy
,
her
pretty
rosy
cheeks
were
my
delight
;
when
I
*NL*
saw
her
in
the
least
pale
,
I
was
sad
.
In
the
chest
of
drawers
,
there
is
*NL*
a
bank-bill
for
five
hundred
francs
.
I
have
not
touched
it
.
It
is
for
*NL*
the
poor
.
Cosette
,
dost
thou
see
thy
little
gown
yonder
on
the
bed
?
dost
*NL*
thou
recognize
it
?
That
was
ten
years
ago
,
however
.
How
time
flies
!
We
*NL*
have
been
very
happy
.
All
is
over
.
Do
not
weep
,
my
children
,
I
am
not
*NL*
going
very
far
,
I
shall
see
you
from
there
,
you
will
only
have
to
*NL*
look
at
night
,
and
you
will
see
me
smile
.
Cosette
,
dost
thou
remember
*NL*
Montfermeil
?
Thou
wert
in
the
forest
,
thou
wert
greatly
terrified
;
dost
*NL*
thou
remember
how
I
took
hold
of
the
handle
of
the
water-bucket
?
That
*NL*
was
the
first
time
that
I
touched
thy
poor
,
little
hand
.
It
was
so
cold
!
*NL*
Ah
!
your
hands
were
red
then
,
mademoiselle
,
they
are
very
white
now
.
And
*NL*
the
big
doll
!
dost
thou
remember
?
Thou
didst
call
her
Catherine
.
Thou
*NL*
regrettedest
not
having
taken
her
to
the
convent
!
How
thou
didst
make
*NL*
me
laugh
sometimes
,
my
sweet
angel
!
When
it
had
been
raining
,
thou
didst
*NL*
float
bits
of
straw
on
the
gutters
,
and
watch
them
pass
away
.
One
day
*NL*
I
gave
thee
a
willow
battledore
and
a
shuttlecock
with
yellow
,
blue
and
*NL*
green
feathers
.
Thou
hast
forgotten
it
.
Thou
wert
roguish
so
young
!
Thou
*NL*
didst
play
.
Thou
didst
put
cherries
in
thy
ears
.
Those
are
things
of
*NL*
the
past
.
The
forests
through
which
one
has
passed
with
one
's
child
,
the
*NL*
trees
under
which
one
has
strolled
,
the
convents
where
one
has
concealed
*NL*
oneself
,
the
games
,
the
hearty
laughs
of
childhood
,
are
shadows
.
I
*NL*
imagined
that
all
that
belonged
to
me
.
In
that
lay
my
stupidity
.
Those
*NL*
Thenardiers
were
wicked
.
Thou
must
forgive
them
.
Cosette
,
the
moment
*NL*
has
come
to
tell
thee
the
name
of
thy
mother
.
She
was
called
Fantine
.
*NL*
Remember
that
name
--
Fantine
.
Kneel
whenever
thou
utterest
it
.
She
*NL*
suffered
much
.
She
loved
thee
dearly
.
She
had
as
much
unhappiness
as
*NL*
thou
hast
had
happiness
.
That
is
the
way
God
apportions
things
.
He
is
*NL*
there
on
high
,
he
sees
us
all
,
and
he
knows
what
he
does
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
his
great
stars
.
I
am
on
the
verge
of
departure
,
my
children
.
Love
each
*NL*
other
well
and
always
.
There
is
nothing
else
but
that
in
the
world
:
love
*NL*
for
each
other
.
You
will
think
sometimes
of
the
poor
old
man
who
died
*NL*
here
.
Oh
my
Cosette
,
it
is
not
my
fault
,
indeed
,
that
I
have
not
seen
*NL*
thee
all
this
time
,
it
cut
me
to
the
heart
;
I
went
as
far
as
the
corner
*NL*
of
the
street
,
I
must
have
produced
a
queer
effect
on
the
people
who
*NL*
saw
me
pass
,
I
was
like
a
madman
,
I
once
went
out
without
my
hat
.
I
no
*NL*
longer
see
clearly
,
my
children
,
I
had
still
other
things
to
say
,
but
*NL*
never
mind
.
Think
a
little
of
me
.
Come
still
nearer
.
I
die
happy
.
Give
*NL*
me
your
dear
and
well-beloved
heads
,
so
that
I
may
lay
my
hands
upon
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cosette
and
Marius
fell
on
their
knees
,
in
despair
,
suffocating
with
*NL*
tears
,
each
beneath
one
of
Jean
Valjean
's
hands
.
Those
august
hands
no
*NL*
longer
moved
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
fallen
backwards
,
the
light
of
the
candles
illuminated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
white
face
looked
up
to
heaven
,
he
allowed
Cosette
and
Marius
to
*NL*
cover
his
hands
with
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
was
starless
and
extremely
dark
.
No
doubt
,
in
the
gloom
,
some
*NL*
immense
angel
stood
erect
with
wings
outspread
,
awaiting
that
soul
.

CHAPTER
VI
--
THE
GRASS
COVERS
AND
THE
RAIN
EFFACES
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
cemetery
of
Pere-Lachaise
,
in
the
vicinity
of
the
common
grave
,
*NL*
far
from
the
elegant
quarter
of
that
city
of
sepulchres
,
far
from
all
*NL*
the
tombs
of
fancy
which
display
in
the
presence
of
eternity
all
the
*NL*
hideous
fashions
of
death
,
in
a
deserted
corner
,
beside
an
old
wall
,
*NL*
beneath
a
great
yew
tree
over
which
climbs
the
wild
convolvulus
,
amid
*NL*
dandelions
and
mosses
,
there
lies
a
stone
.
That
stone
is
no
more
exempt
*NL*
than
others
from
the
leprosy
of
time
,
of
dampness
,
of
the
lichens
and
*NL*
from
the
defilement
of
the
birds
.
The
water
turns
it
green
,
the
air
*NL*
blackens
it
.
It
is
not
near
any
path
,
and
people
are
not
fond
of
*NL*
walking
in
that
direction
,
because
the
grass
is
high
and
their
feet
*NL*
are
immediately
wet
.
When
there
is
a
little
sunshine
,
the
lizards
*NL*
come
thither
.
All
around
there
is
a
quivering
of
weeds
.
In
the
spring
,
*NL*
linnets
warble
in
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stone
is
perfectly
plain
.
In
cutting
it
the
only
thought
was
the
*NL*
requirements
of
the
tomb
,
and
no
other
care
was
taken
than
to
make
the
*NL*
stone
long
enough
and
narrow
enough
to
cover
a
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
name
is
to
be
read
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
,
many
years
ago
,
a
hand
wrote
upon
it
in
pencil
these
four
lines
,
*NL*
which
have
become
gradually
illegible
beneath
the
rain
and
the
dust
,
and
*NL*
which
are
,
to-day
,
probably
effaced
:
*NL*
*NL*
Il
dort
.
Quoique
le
sort
fut
pour
lui
bien
etrange
,
*NL*
Il
vivait
.
Il
mourut
quand
il
n'eut
plus
son
ange
.
*NL*
La
chose
simplement
d'elle-meme
arriva
,
*NL*
Comme
la
nuit
se
fait
lorsque
le
jour
s
`
en
va.

LETTER
TO
M.
DAELLI
*NL*
*NL*
Publisher
of
the
Italian
translation
of
Les
Miserables
in
Milan
.
*NL*
*NL*
HAUTEVILLE-HOUSE
,
October
18
,
1862
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
You
are
right
,
sir
,
when
you
tell
me
that
Les
Miserables
is
written
for
*NL*
all
nations
.
I
do
not
know
whether
it
will
be
read
by
all
,
but
I
wrote
*NL*
it
for
all
.
It
is
addressed
to
England
as
well
as
to
Spain
,
to
Italy
as
*NL*
well
as
to
France
,
to
Germany
as
well
as
to
Ireland
,
to
Republics
which
*NL*
have
slaves
as
well
as
to
Empires
which
have
serfs
.
Social
problems
*NL*
overstep
frontiers
.
The
sores
of
the
human
race
,
those
great
sores
which
*NL*
cover
the
globe
,
do
not
halt
at
the
red
or
blue
lines
traced
upon
the
*NL*
map
.
In
every
place
where
man
is
ignorant
and
despairing
,
in
every
place
*NL*
where
woman
is
sold
for
bread
,
wherever
the
child
suffers
for
lack
of
*NL*
the
book
which
should
instruct
him
and
of
the
hearth
which
should
warm
*NL*
him
,
the
book
of
Les
Miserables
knocks
at
the
door
and
says
:
``
Open
to
*NL*
me
,
I
come
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
hour
of
civilization
through
which
we
are
now
passing
,
and
which
*NL*
is
still
so
sombre
,
the
miserable
's
name
is
Man
;
he
is
agonizing
in
all
*NL*
climes
,
and
he
is
groaning
in
all
languages
.
*NL*
*NL*
Your
Italy
is
no
more
exempt
from
the
evil
than
is
our
France
.
Your
*NL*
admirable
Italy
has
all
miseries
on
the
face
of
it
.
Does
not
banditism
,
*NL*
that
raging
form
of
pauperism
,
inhabit
your
mountains
?
Few
nations
are
*NL*
more
deeply
eaten
by
that
ulcer
of
convents
which
I
have
endeavored
to
*NL*
fathom
.
In
spite
of
your
possessing
Rome
,
Milan
,
Naples
,
Palermo
,
Turin
,
*NL*
Florence
,
Sienna
,
Pisa
,
Mantua
,
Bologna
,
Ferrara
,
Genoa
,
Venice
,
a
*NL*
heroic
history
,
sublime
ruins
,
magnificent
ruins
,
and
superb
cities
,
*NL*
you
are
,
like
ourselves
,
poor
.
You
are
covered
with
marvels
and
vermin
.
*NL*
Assuredly
,
the
sun
of
Italy
is
splendid
,
but
,
alas
,
azure
in
the
sky
*NL*
does
not
prevent
rags
on
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
us
,
you
have
prejudices
,
superstitions
,
tyrannies
,
fanaticisms
,
*NL*
blind
laws
lending
assistance
to
ignorant
customs
.
You
taste
nothing
of
*NL*
the
present
nor
of
the
future
without
a
flavor
of
the
past
being
mingled
*NL*
with
it
.
You
have
a
barbarian
,
the
monk
,
and
a
savage
,
the
lazzarone
.
*NL*
The
social
question
is
the
same
for
you
as
for
us
.
There
are
a
few
less
*NL*
deaths
from
hunger
with
you
,
and
a
few
more
from
fever
;
your
social
*NL*
hygiene
is
not
much
better
than
ours
;
shadows
,
which
are
Protestant
in
*NL*
England
,
are
Catholic
in
Italy
;
but
,
under
different
names
,
the
vescovo
*NL*
is
identical
with
the
bishop
,
and
it
always
means
night
,
and
of
pretty
*NL*
nearly
the
same
quality
.
To
explain
the
Bible
badly
amounts
to
the
same
*NL*
thing
as
to
understand
the
Gospel
badly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Is
it
necessary
to
emphasize
this

Must
this
melancholy
parallelism
*NL*
be
yet
more
completely
verified
?
Have
you
not
indigent
persons
?
Glance
*NL*
below
.
Have
you
not
parasites
?
Glance
up
.
Does
not
that
hideous
balance
,
*NL*
whose
two
scales
,
pauperism
and
parasitism
,
so
mournfully
preserve
their
*NL*
mutual
equilibrium
,
oscillate
before
you
as
it
does
before
us
?
Where
*NL*
is
your
army
of
schoolmasters
,
the
only
army
which
civilization
*NL*
acknowledges
?
*NL*
*NL*
Where
are
your
free
and
compulsory
schools
?
Does
every
one
know
how
to
*NL*
read
in
the
land
of
Dante
and
of
Michael
Angelo
?
Have
you
made
public
*NL*
schools
of
your
barracks
?
Have
you
not
,
like
ourselves
,
an
opulent
*NL*
war-budget
and
a
paltry
budget
of
education
?
Have
not
you
also
that
*NL*
passive
obedience
which
is
so
easily
converted
into
soldierly
obedience
?
*NL*
military
establishment
which
pushes
the
regulations
to
the
extreme
of
*NL*
firing
upon
Garibaldi
;
that
is
to
say
,
upon
the
living
honor
of
Italy
?
*NL*
Let
us
subject
your
social
order
to
examination
,
let
us
take
it
where
it
*NL*
stands
and
as
it
stands
,
let
us
view
its
flagrant
offences
,
show
me
the
*NL*
woman
and
the
child
.
It
is
by
the
amount
of
protection
with
which
these
*NL*
two
feeble
creatures
are
surrounded
that
the
degree
of
civilization
*NL*
is
to
be
measured
.
Is
prostitution
less
heartrending
in
Naples
than
in
*NL*
Paris
?
What
is
the
amount
of
truth
that
springs
from
your
laws
,
and
what
*NL*
amount
of
justice
springs
from
your
tribunals
?
Do
you
chance
to
be
so
*NL*
fortunate
as
to
be
ignorant
of
the
meaning
of
those
gloomy
words
:
public
*NL*
prosecution
,
legal
infamy
,
prison
,
the
scaffold
,
the
executioner
,
the
*NL*
death
penalty
?
Italians
,
with
you
as
with
us
,
Beccaria
is
dead
and
*NL*
Farinace
is
alive
.
And
then
,
let
us
scrutinize
your
state
reasons
.
*NL*
Have
you
a
government
which
comprehends
the
identity
of
morality
and
*NL*
politics
?
You
have
reached
the
point
where
you
grant
amnesty
to
heroes
!
*NL*
Something
very
similar
has
been
done
in
France
.
Stay
,
let
us
pass
*NL*
miseries
in
review
,
let
each
one
contribute
his
pile
,
you
are
as
rich
*NL*
as
we
.
Have
you
not
,
like
ourselves
,
two
condemnations
,
religious
*NL*
condemnation
pronounced
by
the
priest
,
and
social
condemnation
decreed
*NL*
by
the
judge
?
Oh
,
great
nation
of
Italy
,
thou
resemblest
the
great
*NL*
nation
of
France
!
Alas
!
our
brothers
,
you
are
,
like
ourselves
,
*NL*
Miserables
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
depths
of
the
gloom
wherein
you
dwell
,
you
do
not
see
much
more
*NL*
distinctly
than
we
the
radiant
and
distant
portals
of
Eden
.
Only
,
the
*NL*
priests
are
mistaken
.
These
holy
portals
are
before
and
not
behind
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
resume
.
This
book
,
Les
Miserables
,
is
no
less
your
mirror
than
ours
.
*NL*
Certain
men
,
certain
castes
,
rise
in
revolt
against
this
book
,
--
I
*NL*
understand
that
.
Mirrors
,
those
revealers
of
the
truth
,
are
hated
;
that
*NL*
does
not
prevent
them
from
being
of
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
myself
,
I
have
written
for
all
,
with
a
profound
love
for
my
own
*NL*
country
,
but
without
being
engrossed
by
France
more
than
by
any
other
*NL*
nation
.
In
proportion
as
I
advance
in
life
,
I
grow
more
simple
,
and
I
*NL*
become
more
and
more
patriotic
for
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
is
,
moreover
,
the
tendency
of
our
age
,
and
the
law
of
radiance
*NL*
of
the
French
Revolution
;
books
must
cease
to
be
exclusively
French
,
*NL*
Italian
,
German
,
Spanish
,
or
English
,
and
become
European
,
I
say
more
,
*NL*
human
,
if
they
are
to
correspond
to
the
enlargement
of
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
a
new
logic
of
art
,
and
of
certain
requirements
of
composition
*NL*
which
modify
everything
,
even
the
conditions
,
formerly
narrow
,
of
taste
*NL*
and
language
,
which
must
grow
broader
like
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
France
,
certain
critics
have
reproached
me
,
to
my
great
delight
,
*NL*
with
having
transgressed
the
bounds
of
what
they
call
``
French
taste
''
;
I
*NL*
should
be
glad
if
this
eulogium
were
merited
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
short
,
I
am
doing
what
I
can
,
I
suffer
with
the
same
universal
*NL*
suffering
,
and
I
try
to
assuage
it
,
I
possess
only
the
puny
forces
of
a
*NL*
man
,
and
I
cry
to
all
:
``
Help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
sir
,
is
what
your
letter
prompts
me
to
say
;
I
say
it
for
you
and
*NL*
for
your
country
.
If
I
have
insisted
so
strongly
,
it
is
because
of
one
*NL*
phrase
in
your
letter
.
You
write
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
Italians
,
and
they
are
numerous
,
who
say
:
`
This
book
,
Les
*NL*
Miserables
,
is
a
French
book
.
It
does
not
concern
us
.
Let
the
French
*NL*
read
it
as
a
history
,
we
read
it
as
a
romance
.
'
''
--
Alas
!
I
repeat
,
*NL*
whether
we
be
Italians
or
Frenchmen
,
misery
concerns
us
all
.
Ever
since
*NL*
history
has
been
written
,
ever
since
philosophy
has
meditated
,
misery
*NL*
has
been
the
garment
of
the
human
race
;
the
moment
has
at
length
arrived
*NL*
for
tearing
off
that
rag
,
and
for
replacing
,
upon
the
naked
limbs
of
the
*NL*
Man-People
,
the
sinister
fragment
of
the
past
with
the
grand
purple
robe
*NL*
of
the
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
this
letter
seems
to
you
of
service
in
enlightening
some
minds
and
*NL*
in
dissipating
some
prejudices
,
you
are
at
liberty
to
publish
it
,
*NL*
sir
.
Accept
,
I
pray
you
,
a
renewed
assurance
of
my
very
distinguished
*NL*
sentiments
.

Do
you
remember
our

life
,
when
we
were
both
so

young
,
and
when
we
had
no
other
desire
in
our
hearts
than
to
be
well
*NL*
dressed
and
in
love
?
When
,
by
adding
your
age
to
my
age
,
we
could
*NL*
not
count
forty
years
between
us
,
and
when
,
in
our
humble
and
tiny
*NL*
household
,
everything
was
spring
to
us
even
in
winter
.
Fair
days
!
*NL*
Manuel
was
proud
and
wise
,
Paris
sat
at
sacred
banquets
,
Foy
launched
*NL*
thunderbolts
,
and
your
corsage
had
a
pin
on
which
I
pricked
myself
.
*NL*
Everything
gazed
upon
you
.
A
briefless
lawyer
,
when
I
took
you
to
the
*NL*
Prado
to
dine
,
you
were
so
beautiful
that
the
roses
seemed
to
me
to
turn
*NL*
round
,
and
I
heard
them
say
:
Is
she
not
beautiful
!
How
good
she
smells
!
*NL*
What
billowing
hair
!
Beneath
her
mantle
she
hides
a
wing
.
Her
charming
*NL*
bonnet
is
hardly
unfolded
.
I
wandered
with
thee
,
pressing
thy
supple
*NL*
arm
.
The
passers-by
thought
that
love
bewitched
had
wedded
,
in
our
happy
*NL*
couple
,
the
gentle
month
of
April
to
the
fair
month
of
May
.
We
lived
*NL*
concealed
,
content
,
with
closed
doors
,
devouring
love
,
that
sweet
*NL*
forbidden
fruit
.
My
mouth
had
not
uttered
a
thing
when
thy
heart
had
*NL*
already
responded
.
The
Sorbonne
was
the
bucolic
spot
where
I
adored
thee
*NL*
from
eve
till
morn
.
'T
is
thus
that
an
amorous
soul
applies
the
chart
of
*NL*
the
Tender
to
the
Latin
country
.
O
Place
Maubert
!
O
Place
Dauphine
!
*NL*
When
in
the
fresh
spring-like
hut
thou
didst
draw
thy
stocking
on
thy
*NL*
delicate
leg
,
I
saw
a
star
in
the
depths
of
the
garret
.
I
have
read
*NL*
a
great
deal
of
Plato
,
but
nothing
of
it
remains
by
me
;
better
than
*NL*
Malebranche
and
then
Lamennais
thou
didst
demonstrate
to
me
celestial
*NL*
goodness
with
a
flower
which
thou
gavest
to
me
,
I
obeyed
thee
,
thou
*NL*
didst
submit
to
me
;
oh
gilded
garret
!
to
lace
thee
!
to
behold
thee
going
*NL*
and
coming
from
dawn
in
thy
chemise
,
gazing
at
thy
young
brow
in
thine
*NL*
ancient
mirror
!
And
who
,
then
,
would
forego
the
memory
of
those
days
of
*NL*
aurora
and
the
firmament
,
of
flowers
,
of
gauze
and
of
moire
,
when
love
*NL*
stammers
a
charming
slang
?
Our
gardens
consisted
of
a
pot
of
tulips
;
*NL*
thou
didst
mask
the
window
with
thy
petticoat
;
I
took
the
earthenware
*NL*
bowl
and
I
gave
thee
the
Japanese
cup
.
And
those
great
misfortunes
which
*NL*
made
us
laugh
!
Thy
cuff
scorched
,
thy
boa
lost
!
And
that
dear
portrait
*NL*
of
the
divine
Shakespeare
which
we
sold
one
evening
that
we
might
sup
!
I
*NL*
was
a
beggar
and
thou
wert
charitable
.
I
kissed
thy
fresh
round
arms
*NL*
in
haste
.
A
folio
Dante
served
us
as
a
table
on
which
to
eat
merrily
a
*NL*
centime
's
worth
of
chestnuts
.
The
first
time
that
,
in
my
joyous
den
,
I
*NL*
snatched
a
kiss
from
thy
fiery
lip
,
when
thou
wentest
forth
,
dishevelled
*NL*
and
blushing
,
I
turned
deathly
pale
and
I
believed
in
God
.
Dost
thou
*NL*
recall
our
innumerable
joys
,
and
all
those
fichus
changed
to
rags
?
Oh
!
*NL*
what
sighs
from
our
hearts
full
of
gloom
fluttered
forth
to
the
heavenly
*NL*
depths
!
