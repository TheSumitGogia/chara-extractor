lying

on

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

so

sighed
Meg
,
looking
down
at
her
old
*NL*
dress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

nothing

added
little

with
an
injured

sniff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We

contentedly
,
*NL*
from

*NL*
*NL*
The
four
young
faces
on
which
the
firelight
shone
brightened
at
the
*NL*
cheerful
words
,
but
darkened
again
as
Jo
said
sadly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
n't
got
father
,
and
shall
not
have
him
for
a
long
time

''
She
*NL*
did
n't
say
``
perhaps
never

''
but
each
silently
added
it
,
thinking
of
*NL*
father
far
away
,
where
the
fighting
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
spoke
for
a
minute
;
then
Meg
said
in
an
altered
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
reason
mother
proposed
not
having
any
presents
this
*NL*
Christmas
was
because
it
is
going
to
be
a
hard
winter
for
every
one
;
and
*NL*
she
thinks
we
ought
not
to
spend
money
for
pleasure
,
when
our
men
are
*NL*
suffering
so
in
the
army
.
We
ca
n't
do
much
,
but
we
can
make
our
little
*NL*
sacrifices
,

ought

do
it
gladly

But
I
am
afraid
I
do
n't
;

and
Meg
*NL*
shook
her
head
,
as
she
thought
regretfully
of
all
the
pretty
things
she
*NL*
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
n't
think
the
little
we
should

do
any
good

We
've

each
got
a
dollar
,
and
the
army
would
n't
be
much
helped
by
our
giving
*NL*
that

I
agree
not

expect
anything
from
mother

you
,
but
I
do
want
*NL*
to
buy
Undine
and
Sintram
for
myself

I

wanted
it

long

said
*NL*
Jo
,
who
was
a
bookworm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
planned
to
spend
mine
in
new

said
Beth
,
with
a
little
sigh
,
*NL*
which
no
one
heard
but
the
hearth-brush
and
kettle-holder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
get

Amy
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*

buy

work
hard

cried
Jo
,
examining
the
heels
*NL*
of
her
shoes
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

began
Meg
,
in
the
complaining
tone
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do

half
such

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
naughty
to
fret

but
I
do
think
washing
dishes

keeping
things

tidy
is
the
worst
work
in
the
world

It
makes
me
cross
;
and
my
hands
get
*NL*
so
stiff
,
I
ca
n't
practise
well
at

''
and
Beth
looked
at
her
rough
*NL*
hands
with
a
sigh
that
any
one
could
hear
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

believe
any
of
you
suffer

Amy
;

laughing
.

*NL*
``

proper

Amy
,
*NL*
with
dignity

*NL*
*NL*
``

``

the

observed
Amy

with
a
reproving
look
at
*NL*
the
long
figure
stretched
on
the
rug

Jo
immediately
sat
up

put
her

hands
in

pockets

began
to
whistle

sang
Beth
,
the
peace-maker
,
with
*NL*
such
a
funny
face
that
both
sharp
voices
softened
to
a
laugh
,
and
the
*NL*
``
pecking
''
ended
for
that
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

you
are
both

said
Meg
,
beginning
to
*NL*
lecture
in
her
elder-sisterly
fashion
.
``
You
are
old
enough

leave
off
*NL*
boyish
tricks

behave
better

Josephine

It
did
n't
matter
so
much
*NL*
when
you
were
a
little
girl
;
but
now
you
are
so
tall

turn
up

you
should
remember

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

not

me
one

I
'll
wear

tails
till
I

cried
Jo
,
pulling
off
her
net
,
and
shaking
down
*NL*
a
chestnut
mane
.
``
I
hate
to
think
I

enough

I
ca

get
over
my
disappointment
in
not
being
a
boy

it
's
*NL*
worse
than
ever
now

for
I
'm
dying

I

only
stay

knit

And
Jo
shook
the
*NL*
blue
army-sock
till
the
needles
rattled
like
castanets
,
and
her
ball
*NL*
bounded
across
the
room

*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Jo
!
It
's
too
bad

it

so
you
must
try
to
be
*NL*
contented
with
making
your
name
boyish
,
and
playing
brother
to
us
*NL*
girls

said
Beth
,
stroking
the
rough
head
at
her
knee
with
a
hand
that
*NL*
all
the
dish-washing
and
dusting
in
the
world
could
not
make
ungentle
in
*NL*
its
touch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As

you

Amy

continued
Meg
,
``
you
are
altogether
too
particular

prim

your
nice
manners

refined
ways

of
speaking
,
when
you
do
n't
try
to
be
elegant
;
but
your
absurd
words
are
*NL*
as
bad
as
Jo

slang

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Jo
is
a
tom-boy
and
Amy
a
goose

what
am
I

please

''
asked
Beth
,
*NL*
ready
to
share
the
lecture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
dear
,
and
nothing
else
,
''
answered
Meg
warmly
;
and
no
one
*NL*
contradicted
her
,
for
the
``
Mouse
''
was
the
pet
of
the
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
young
readers
like
to
know
``
how
people
look
,
''
we
will
take
this
*NL*
moment
to
give
them
a
little
sketch
of
the
four
sisters
,
who
sat
*NL*
knitting
away
in
the
twilight
,
while
the
December
snow
fell
quietly
*NL*
without
,
and
the
fire
crackled
cheerfully
within
.
It
was
a
comfortable
*NL*
old
room
,
though
the
carpet
was
faded
and
the
furniture
very
plain
;
for
*NL*
a
good
picture
or
two
hung
on
the
walls
,
books
filled
the
recesses
,
*NL*
chrysanthemums
and
Christmas
roses
bloomed
in
the
windows
,
and
a
*NL*
pleasant
atmosphere
of
home-peace
pervaded
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
,
the
eldest
of
the
four
,
was
sixteen
,
and
very
pretty
,
being
*NL*
plump
and
fair
,
with
large
eyes
,
plenty
of
soft
,
brown
hair
,
a
sweet
*NL*
mouth
,
and
white
hands
,
of
which
she
was
rather
vain
.
Fifteen-year-old
*NL*
Jo
was
very
tall
,
thin
,
and
brown
,
and
reminded
one
of
a
colt
;
for
she
*NL*
never
seemed
to
know
what
to
do
with
her
long
limbs
,
which
were
very
*NL*
much
in
her
way
.
She
had
a
decided
mouth
,
a
comical
nose
,
and
sharp
,
*NL*
gray
eyes
,
which
appeared
to
see
everything
,
and
were
by
turns
fierce
,
*NL*
funny
,
or
thoughtful
.
Her
long
,
thick
hair
was
her
one
beauty
;
but
it
*NL*
was
usually
bundled
into
a
net
,
to
be
out
of
her
way
.
Round
shoulders
*NL*
had
Jo
,
big
hands
and
feet
,
a
fly-away
look
to
her
clothes
,
and
the
*NL*
uncomfortable
appearance
of
a
girl
who
was
rapidly
shooting
up
into
a
*NL*
woman
,
and
did
n't
like
it
.
Elizabeth
--
or
Beth
,
as
every
one
called
*NL*
her
--
was
a
rosy
,
smooth-haired
,
bright-eyed
girl
of
thirteen
,
with
a
shy
*NL*
manner
,
a
timid
voice
,
and
a
peaceful
expression
,
which
was
seldom
*NL*
disturbed
.
Her
father
called
her
``
Little
Tranquillity
,
''
and
the
name
*NL*
suited
her
excellently
;
for
she
seemed
to
live
in
a
happy
world
of
her
*NL*
own
,
only
venturing
out
to
meet
the
few
whom
she
trusted
and
loved
.
Amy
,
*NL*
though
the
youngest
,
was
a
most
important
person
,
--
in
her
own
opinion
at
*NL*
least
.
A
regular
snow-maiden
,
with
blue
eyes
,
and
yellow
hair
,
curling
*NL*
on
her
shoulders
,
pale
and
slender
,
and
always
carrying
herself
like
a
*NL*
young
lady
mindful
of
her
manners
.
What
the
characters
of
the
four
*NL*
sisters
were
we
will
leave
to
be
found
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
struck
six
;
and
,
having
swept
up
the
hearth
,
Beth
put
a
pair
*NL*
of
slippers
down
to
warm
.
Somehow
the
sight
of
the
old
shoes
had
a
good
*NL*
effect
upon
the
girls
;
for
mother
was
coming
,
and
every
one
brightened
*NL*
to
welcome
her
.
Meg
stopped
lecturing
,
and
lighted
the
lamp
,
Amy
got
out
*NL*
of
the
easy-chair
without
being
asked
,
and
Jo
forgot
how
tired
she
was
*NL*
as
she
sat
up
to
hold
the
slippers
nearer
to
the
blaze
.

Meg
,

Jo
cut
in
with
a
decided
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
the
man
of

gone

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell

'll

Beth
;
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
like
you

What
will
we
get
?
''
exclaimed
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
thought
soberly
for
a
minute
;
then
Meg
announced
,
as
if
the
*NL*
idea
was
suggested
by
the
sight
of
her
own
pretty
hands
,
``
I
shall
give
*NL*
her
a
nice

of
gloves

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Jo

*NL*
*NL*
``
Some

said
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
get

she

I

added
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
we
give
the
things
?
''
asked
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put

*NL*

down

in

*NL*

observed
Meg
,
who
was
as
much
a
child
as
ever
about
*NL*
``
dressing-up

frolics

*NL*
*NL*
``

We

returned
*NL*
Amy
,
who
was
not
gifted
with
dramatic
power
,
but
was
chosen
because
she
*NL*
was
small
enough
to
be
borne
out
shrieking
by

and
away
went
Jo

*NL*
with
a
melodramatic
scream

was
truly
thrilling

*NL*
*NL*
Amy
followed
,
but
she
poked
her
hands
out
stiffly
before
her
,
and
jerked
*NL*
herself
along
as
if
she
went
by
machinery
;
and
her
``
Ow

was
more
*NL*
suggestive
of
pins
being
run
into
her
than
of
fear

anguish

Jo
gave
*NL*
a
despairing
groan

Meg
laughed
outright

Beth
let
her
bread

burn
as
she
watched

*NL*
*NL*
Then
things
went
smoothly
,
for
Don
Pedro
defied
the
world
in
a
speech
of
*NL*
two
pages
without
a
single
break
;
Hagar
,
the
witch
,
chanted
an
awful
*NL*
incantation
over
her
kettleful
of
simmering
toads
,
with
weird
effect
;
*NL*
Roderigo
rent
his
chains
asunder
manfully
,
and
Hugo
died
in
agonies
of
*NL*
remorse
and
arsenic
,
with
a
wild
``
Ha

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
best
we

had
yet

said
Meg
,
as
the
dead
villain
sat
up
and
*NL*
rubbed
his
elbows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

exclaimed
Beth
,
who
firmly
believed
that
her

were
gifted
with
wonderful
genius
in
all
things

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Jo
modestly
.

I

`
The

do
the

part

muttered
Jo
,
rolling
her
*NL*
eyes
and
clutching
at
the
air
,
as
she
had
seen
a
famous
tragedian
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

cried
Meg
,
and
the
rehearsal
ended
in
a
*NL*
general
burst
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad

said
a
cheery
voice
at
the
door
,
*NL*
and
actors
and
audience
turned
to
welcome
a
tall
,
motherly
lady
,
with
a
*NL*
``
can-I-help-you
''
look
about
her
which
was
truly
delightful
.
She
was
not
*NL*
elegantly
dressed
,
but
a
noble-looking
woman
,
and
the
girls
thought
the
*NL*
gray
cloak
and
unfashionable
bonnet
covered
the
most
splendid
mother
in
*NL*
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

dearies

how
have
you
got
on

so
much

tired

*NL*
While
making
these
maternal
inquiries
Mrs.
March
got
her
wet
things
off
,
*NL*
her
warm
slippers
on
,
and
sitting
down
in
the
easy-chair
,
drew
Amy
to
*NL*
her
lap
,
preparing
to
enjoy
the
happiest
hour
of
her
busy
day
.
The
girls
*NL*
flew
about
,
trying
to
make
things
comfortable
,
each
in
her
own
way
.
Meg
*NL*
arranged
the
tea-table
;
Jo
brought
wood
and
set
chairs
,
dropping
,
*NL*
overturning
,
and
clattering
everything
she
touched
;
Beth
trotted
to
and
*NL*
fro
between
parlor
and
kitchen
,
quiet
and
busy
;
while
Amy
gave
*NL*
directions
to
every
one

as
she
sat
with
her
hands
folded

*NL*
*NL*
As
they
gathered
about
the
table

Mrs.
March
said
,
with
a
particularly
*NL*
happy
face
,
``
I
've
got

*NL*
*NL*
A
quick
,
bright
smile
went
round
like
a
streak
of
sunshine

Beth
clapped
*NL*
her
hands
,
regardless
of
the
biscuit
she
held
,
and
Jo
tossed
up
her
*NL*
napkin
,
crying

``

*NL*
``
Yes

Mrs.

March
,
patting
her
pocket
as
if
she
had
got
a
treasure
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Jo

choking
in

dropping
her

bread

butter
side
down

on
the
carpet
,
in
her
haste
to
get
at
the
*NL*
treat

*NL*
*NL*
Beth
ate
no
more
,
but
crept
away
,
to
sit
in
her
shadowy
corner
and
brood
*NL*
over
the
delight
to
come
,
till
the
others
were
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
was
so
splendid
in

go

a
chaplain

old

drafted

not
strong
enough

Meg
*NL*
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

a

nurse
,
so
I
could
be
near
him
and
help
him

exclaimed
Jo
,
with
a
groan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
very
disagreeable

sleep
in
a
tent

eat
all

bad-tasting

drink
out

sighed
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
will
he
come
home

Marmee

asked
Beth
,
with
a
little
quiver
in
*NL*
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

many
months

sick

will
stay

do
his

work
faithfully
as
long
as
he
can

we
wo

him
back
a

Now
come

*NL*
*NL*
They
all
drew
to
the
fire
,
mother
in
the
big
chair
with
Beth
at
her
*NL*
feet
,
Meg
and
Amy
perched
on
either
arm
of
the
chair
,
and
Jo
leaning
on
*NL*
the
back
,
where
no
one
would
see
any
sign
of
emotion
if
the
letter
*NL*
should
happen
to
be
touching
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
few
letters
were
written
in
those
hard
times
that
were
not
*NL*
touching
,
especially
those
which
fathers
sent
home
.
In
this
one
little
*NL*
was
said
of
the
hardships
endured
,
the
dangers
faced
,
or
the
*NL*
homesickness
conquered
;
it
was
a
cheerful
,
hopeful
letter
,
full
of
*NL*
lively
descriptions
of
camp
life
,
marches
,
and
military
news
;
and
only
*NL*
at
the
end
did
the
writer
's
heart
overflow
with
fatherly
love
and
*NL*
longing
for
the
little
girls
at
home

hard
days
*NL*
need
not
be
wasted
.
I
know
they
will
remember
all
I
said
to
them
,
that
*NL*
they
will
be
loving
children
to
you
,
will
do
their
duty
faithfully
,
*NL*
fight
their
bosom
enemies
bravely
,
and
conquer
themselves
so
*NL*
beautifully
,
that
when
I
come
back
to
them
I
may
be
fonder
and
prouder
*NL*
than
ever
of
my
little
women
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
sniffed
when
they
came
to
that
part
;
Jo
was
n't
ashamed
of
the
*NL*
great
tear
that
dropped
off
the
end
of
her
nose
,
and
Amy
never
minded
*NL*
the
rumpling
of
her
curls
as
she
hid
her
face
on
her
mother
's
shoulder
*NL*
and
sobbed
out
,
``
I
_
am
_
a
selfish
girl
!
but
I
'll
truly
try
to
be
better
,
*NL*
so
he
may
n't
be
disappointed
in
me
by
and
by
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
all
will
!
''
cried
Meg
.
``
I
think
too
much
of
my
looks
,
and
hate
to
*NL*
work
,
but
wo
n't
any
more
,
if
I
can
help
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
and
be
what
he
loves
to
call
me
,
'
a
little
woman
,
'
and
not
be
*NL*
rough
and
wild
;
but
do
my
duty
here
instead
of
wanting
to
be
somewhere
*NL*
else
,
''
said
Jo
,
thinking
that
keeping
her
temper
at
home
was
a
much
*NL*
harder
task
than
facing
a
rebel
or
two
down
South
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
said
nothing
,
but
wiped
away
her
tears
with
the
blue
army-sock
,
and
*NL*
began
to
knit
with
all
her
might
,
losing
no
time
in
doing
the
duty
that
*NL*
lay
nearest
her
,
while
she
resolved
in
her
quiet
little
soul
to
be
all
*NL*
that
father
hoped
to
find
her
when
the
year
brought
round
the
happy
*NL*
coming
home
.

Mrs.
March
broke
the
silence
that
followed
Jo
's
words
,
by
saying
in
her
*NL*
cheery
voice
,
``
Do
you
remember
how
you
used
to
play
Pilgrim
's
Progress
*NL*
when
you
were
little
things
?
Nothing
delighted
you
more
than
to
have
me
*NL*
tie
my
piece-bags
on
your
backs
for
burdens
,
give
you
hats
and
sticks
*NL*
and
rolls
of
paper
,
and
let
you
travel
through
the
house
from
the
*NL*
cellar
,
which
was
the
City
of
Destruction
,
up
,
up
,
to
the
house-top
,
*NL*
where
you
had
all
the
lovely
things
you
could
collect
to
make
a
*NL*
Celestial
City
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fun
it
was
,
especially
going
by
the
lions
,
fighting
Apollyon
,
and
*NL*
passing
through
the
Valley
where
the
hobgoblins
were
!
''
said
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
liked
the
place
where
the
bundles
fell
off
and
tumbled
down
stairs
,
''
*NL*
said
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
favorite
part
was
when
we
came
out
on
the
flat
roof
where
our
*NL*
flowers
and
arbors
and
pretty
things
were
,
and
all
stood
and
sung
for
*NL*
joy
up
there
in
the
sunshine
,

said
Beth
,
smiling
,
as
if
that
pleasant
*NL*
moment
had
come
back
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
remember
much
about
it
,
except
that
I
was
afraid
of
the
cellar
*NL*
and
the
dark
entry
,
and
always
liked
the
cake
and
milk
we
had
up
at
the
*NL*
top
.
If
I
was
n't
too
old
for
such
things
,
I
'd
rather
like
to
play
it
*NL*
over
again
,
''
said
Amy
,
who
began
to
talk
of
renouncing
childish
things
*NL*
at
the
mature
age
of
twelve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
never
are
too
old
for
this
,
my
dear
,
because
it
is
a
play
we
are
*NL*
playing
all
the
time
in
one
way
or
another
.
Our
burdens
are
here
,
our
*NL*
road
is
before
us
,
and
the
longing
for
goodness
and
happiness
is
the
*NL*
guide
that
leads
us
through
many
troubles
and
mistakes
to
the
peace
*NL*
which
is
a
true
Celestial
City
.
Now
,
my
little
pilgrims
,
suppose
you
*NL*
begin
again
,
not
in
play
,
but
in
earnest
,
and
see
how
far
on
you
can
get
*NL*
before
father
comes
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
mother
?
Where
are
our
bundles
?
''
asked
Amy
,
who
was
a
very
*NL*
literal
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
of
you
told
what
your
burden
was
just
now
,
except
Beth
;
I
rather
*NL*
think
she
has
n't
got
any
,
''
said
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
;
mine
is
dishes
and
dusters
,
and
envying
girls
with
nice
*NL*
pianos
,
and
being
afraid
of
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
's
bundle
was
such
a
funny
one
that
everybody
wanted
to
laugh
;
but
*NL*
nobody
did
,
for
it
would
have
hurt
her
feelings
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
do
it
,
''
said
Meg
thoughtfully
.
``
It
is
only
another
name
for
*NL*
trying
to
be
good
,
and
the
story
may
help
us
;
for
though
we
do
want
to
*NL*
be
good
,
it
's
hard
work
,
and
we
forget
,
and
do
n't
do
our
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
in
the
Slough
of
Despond
to-night
,
and
mother
came
and
pulled
*NL*
us
out
as
Help
did
in
the
book
.
We
ought
to
have
our
roll
of
directions
,
*NL*
like
Christian
.
What
shall
we
do
about
that
?
''
asked
Jo
,
delighted
with
*NL*
the
fancy
which
lent
a
little
romance
to
the
very
dull
task
of
doing
her
*NL*
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
under
your
pillows
,
Christmas
morning
,
and
you
will
find
your
*NL*
guide-book
,
''
replied
Mrs.
March
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
over
the
new
plan
while
old
Hannah
cleared
the
table
;
then
*NL*
out
came
the
four
little
work-baskets
,
and
the
needles
flew
as
the
girls
*NL*
made
sheets
for
Aunt
March
.
It
was
uninteresting
sewing
,
but
to-night
no
*NL*
one
grumbled
.
They
adopted
Jo
's
plan
of
dividing
the
long
seams
into
*NL*
four
parts
,
and
calling
the
quarters
Europe
,
Asia
,
Africa
,
and
America
,
*NL*
and
in
that
way
got
on
capitally
,
especially
when
they
talked
about
the
*NL*
different
countries
as
they
stitched
their
way
through
them
.

*NL*
No

Beth
could
get
much
music
out
of
the
old
piano
;
but
she
had
a
*NL*
way
of
softly
touching
the
yellow
keys
,
and
making
a
pleasant
*NL*
accompaniment
to
the
simple
songs
they
sung
.
Meg
had
a
voice
like
a
*NL*
flute
,
and
she
and
her
mother
led
the
little
choir
.
Amy
chirped
like
a
*NL*
cricket
,
and
Jo
wandered
through
the
airs
at
her
own
sweet
will
,
always
*NL*
coming
out
at
the
wrong
place
with
a
croak
or
a
quaver
that
spoilt
the
*NL*
most
pensive
tune
.
They
had
always
done
this
from
the
time
they
could
*NL*
lisp
*NL*
*NL*
``
Crinkle

crinkle

`

''
*NL*
*NL*
and
it
had
become
a
household
custom
,
for
the
mother
was
a
born
singer
.
*NL*
The
first
sound
in
the
morning
was
her
voice

as
she
went
about
the
*NL*
house
singing
like
a
lark

and
the
last
sound
at
night
was
the
same
*NL*
cheery
sound
,
for
the
girls
never
grew
too
old
for
that
familiar
*NL*
lullaby

A
MERRY
CHRISTMAS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
was
the
first
to
wake
in
the
gray
dawn
of
Christmas
morning
.
No
*NL*
stockings
hung
at
the
fireplace
,
and
for
a
moment
she
felt
as
much
*NL*
disappointed
as
she
did
long
ago
,
when
her
little
sock
fell
down
because
*NL*
it
was
so
crammed
with
goodies
.
Then
she
remembered
her
mother
's
*NL*
promise
,
and
,
slipping
her
hand
under
her
pillow
,
drew
out
a
little
*NL*
crimson-covered
book
.
She
knew
it
very
well
,
for
it
was
that
beautiful
*NL*
old
story
of
the
best
life
ever
lived
,
and
Jo
felt
that
it
was
a
true
*NL*
guide-book
for
any
pilgrim
going
the
long
journey
.
She
woke
Meg
with
a
*NL*
``
Merry
Christmas
,
''
and
bade
her
see
what
was
under
her
pillow
.
A
*NL*
green-covered
book
appeared
,
with
the
same
picture
inside
,
and
a
few
*NL*
words
written
by
their
mother
,
which
made
their
one
present
very
*NL*
precious
in
their
eyes
.
Presently
Beth
and
Amy
woke
,
to
rummage
and
find
*NL*
their
little
books
also
,
--
one
dove-colored
,
the
other
blue
;
and
all
sat
*NL*
looking
at
and
talking
about
them
,
while
the
east
grew
rosy
with
the
*NL*
coming
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
her
small
vanities
,
Margaret
had
a
sweet
and
pious
nature
,
*NL*
which
unconsciously
influenced
her
sisters
,
especially
Jo
,
who
loved
her
*NL*
very
tenderly
,
and
obeyed
her
because
her
advice
was
so
gently
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Girls
,
''
said
Meg
seriously
,
looking
from
the
tumbled
head
beside
her
to
*NL*
the
two
little
night-capped
ones
in
the
room
beyond
,
``
mother
wants
us
to
*NL*
read
and
love
and
mind
these
books
,
and
we
must
begin
at
once
.
We
used
*NL*
to
be
faithful
about
it
;
but
since
father
went
away
,
and
all
this
war
*NL*
trouble
unsettled
us
,
we
have
neglected
many
things
.
You
can
do
as
you
*NL*
please
;
but
_
I
_
shall
keep
my
book
on
the
table
here
,
and
read
a
little
*NL*
every
morning
as
soon
as
I
wake
,
for
I
know
it
will
do
me
good
,
and
help
*NL*
me
through
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
opened
her
new
book
and
began
to
read
.
Jo
put
her
arm
round
*NL*
her
,
and
,
leaning
cheek
to
cheek
,
read
also
,
with
the
quiet
expression
*NL*
so
seldom
seen
on
her
restless
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
Meg
is
!
Come
,
Amy
,
let
's
do
as
they
do
.
I
'll
help
you
with
the
*NL*
hard
words
,
and
they
'll
explain
things
if
we
do
n't
understand
,
''
*NL*
whispered
Beth
,
very
much
impressed
by
the
pretty
books
and
her
sisters
'
*NL*
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
mine
is
blue
,
''
said
Amy
;
and
then
the
rooms
were
very
still
*NL*
while
the
pages
were
softly
turned
,
and
the
winter
sunshine
crept
in
to
*NL*
touch
the
bright
heads
and
serious
faces
with
a
Christmas
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
mother
?
''
asked
Meg
,
as
she
and
Jo
ran
down
to
thank
her
for
*NL*
their
gifts
,
half
an
hour
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goodness
only
knows
.
Some
poor
creeter
come
a-beggin
'
,
and
your
ma
went
*NL*
straight
off
to
see
what
was
needed
.
There
never

was
_
such
a
woman
for
*NL*
givin

away
vittles
and
drink

clothes
and
firin

''
replied
Hannah
,
who
*NL*
had
lived
with
the
family
since
Meg
was
born
,
and
was
considered
by
them
*NL*
all
more
as
a
friend
than
a
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
be
back
soon
,
I
think
;
so
fry
your
cakes
,
and
have
everything
*NL*
ready

said
Meg
,
looking
over
the
presents
which
were
collected
in
a
*NL*
basket
and
kept
under
the
sofa
,
ready
to
be
produced
at
the
proper
time
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
where
is
Amy
's
bottle
of
cologne
?
''
she
added
,
as
the
little
flask
*NL*
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
took
it
out
a
minute
ago
,
and
went
off
with
it
to
put
a
ribbon
on

it

or
some
such
notion

''
replied
Jo
,
dancing
about
the
room
to
take
the
*NL*
first
stiffness
off
the
new
army-slippers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nice
my
handkerchiefs
look
,
do
n't
they
?
Hannah
washed
and
ironed
*NL*
them
for
me
,
and
I
marked
them
all
myself
,
''
said
Beth
,
looking
proudly
*NL*
at
the
somewhat
uneven
letters
which
had
cost
her
such
labor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
the

she
's
gone

put

on

cried
Jo
,
taking
up
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
right
?
I
thought
it
was
better
to
do
it
so
,
because
Meg
's
*NL*
initials
are
'M

M.

and
I
do
n't
want
any

to
use

*NL*
said
Beth
,
looking
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right

dear
,
and
a
very
pretty
idea

quite
sensible

too

no

can
ever
mistake
now

It
will
please

very
much

said
*NL*
Meg
,
with
a
frown
for
Jo
and
a
smile
for
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
mother

Hide
the
basket

cried
Jo
,
as
a
door
slammed
,
*NL*
and
steps
sounded
in
the
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
came
in
hastily
,
and
looked
rather
abashed
when
she
saw
her
sisters
*NL*
all
waiting
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
have
you
been
,
and
what
are
you
hiding
behind

asked
Meg
,
*NL*
surprised
to
see
,
by
her
hood
and
cloak
,
that
lazy
Amy
had
been
out
so
*NL*
early
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

came

to
be
selfish
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
Amy
showed
the
handsome
flask
which
replaced
the
cheap
*NL*
one
;
and
looked
so
earnest
and
humble
in
her
little
effort
to
forget
*NL*
herself
that
Meg
hugged
her
on
the
spot
,
and
Jo
pronounced
her
``
a
*NL*
trump
,
''
while
Beth
ran
to
the
window
,
and
picked
her
finest
rose
to
*NL*
ornament
the
stately
bottle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
I
felt
ashamed
of
my
present
,
after
reading
and
talking
about
*NL*
being
good
this
morning
,
so
I
ran
round
the
corner
and
changed
it
the
*NL*
minute
I
was
up
:
and
I
'm
_
so
_
glad
,
for
mine
is
the
handsomest
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
bang
of
the
street-door
sent
the
basket
under
the
sofa
,
and
the
*NL*
girls
to
the
table
,
eager
for
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merry
Christmas
,
Marmee
!
Many
of
them
!
Thank
you
for
our
books
;
we
read
*NL*
some
,
and
mean
to
every
day
,
''
they
cried
,
in
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Merry
Christmas
,
little
daughters
!
I
'm
glad
you
began
at
once
,
and
hope
*NL*
you
will
keep
on
.
But
I
want
to
say
one
word
before
we
sit
down
.
Not
far
*NL*
away
from
here
lies
a
poor
woman
with
a
little
new-born
baby
.
Six
*NL*
children
are
huddled
into
one
bed
to
keep
from
freezing
,
for
they
have
*NL*
no
fire
.
There
is
nothing
to
eat
over
there
;
and
the
oldest
boy
came
to
*NL*
tell
me
they
were
suffering
hunger
and
cold
.
My
girls
,
will
you
give
*NL*
them
your
breakfast
as
a
Christmas
present
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
all
unusually
hungry
,
having
waited
nearly
an
hour
,
and
for
a
*NL*
minute
no
one
spoke
;
only
a
minute
,
for
Jo
exclaimed
impetuously
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
you
came
before
we
began
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
go
and
help
carry
the
things
to
the
poor
little
children
?
''
asked
*NL*
Beth
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
shall
take
the
cream
and
the
muffins
,
''
added
Amy
,
heroically
giving
*NL*
up
the
articles
she
most
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
was
already
covering
the
buckwheats
,
and
piling
the
bread
into
one
*NL*
big
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
'd
do
it
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
smiling
as
if
satisfied
.
``
You
*NL*
shall
all
go
and
help
me
,
and
when
we
come
back
we
will
have
bread
and
*NL*
milk
for
breakfast
,
and
make
it
up
at
dinner-time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
soon
ready
,
and
the
procession
set
out
.
Fortunately
it
was
*NL*
early
,
and
they
went
through
back
streets
,
so
few
people
saw
them
,
and
*NL*
no
one
laughed
at
the
queer
party
.

The
procession
set
out
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
A
poor
,
bare
,
miserable
room
it
was
,
with
broken
windows
,
no
fire
,
*NL*
ragged
bed-clothes
,
a
sick
mother
,
wailing
baby
,
and
a
group
of
pale
,
*NL*
hungry
children
cuddled
under
one
old
quilt
,
trying
to
keep
warm
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
the
big
eyes
stared
and
the
blue
lips
smiled
as
the
girls
went
in
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
mein
Gott
!
it
is
good
angels
come
to
us
!
''
said
the
poor
woman
,
*NL*
crying
for
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Funny
angels
in
hoods
and
mittens
,
''
said
Jo
,
and
set
them
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
it
really
did
seem
as
if
kind
spirits
had
been
at
work
*NL*
there
.
Hannah
,
who
had
carried
wood
,
made
a
fire
,
and
stopped
up
the
*NL*
broken
panes
with
old
hats
and
her
own
cloak
.
Mrs.
March
gave
the
mother
*NL*
tea
and
gruel
,
and
comforted
her
with
promises
of
help
,
while
she
*NL*
dressed
the
little
baby
as
tenderly
as
if
it
had
been
her
own
.
The
*NL*
girls
,
meantime
,
spread
the
table
,
set
the
children
round
the
fire
,
and
*NL*
fed
them
like
so
many
hungry
birds
,
--
laughing
,
talking
,
and
trying
to
*NL*
understand
the
funny
broken
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Das
ist
gut
!
''
``
Die
Engel-kinder
!
''
cried
the
poor
things
,
as
they
ate
,
*NL*
and
warmed
their
purple
hands
at
the
comfortable
blaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
had
never
been
called
angel
children
before
,
and
thought
it
*NL*
very
agreeable
,
especially
Jo
,
who
had
been
considered
a
``
Sancho
''
ever
*NL*
since
she
was
born
.
That
was
a
very
happy
breakfast
,
though
they
did
n't
*NL*
get
any
of
it
;
and
when
they
went
away
,
leaving
comfort
behind
,
I
think
*NL*
there
were
not
in
all
the
city
four
merrier
people
than
the
hungry
*NL*
little
girls
who
gave
away
their
breakfasts
and
contented
themselves
*NL*
with
bread
and
milk
on
Christmas
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
loving
our
neighbor
better
than
ourselves
,
and
I
like
it
,
''
said
*NL*
Meg
,
as
they
set
out
their
presents
,
while
their
mother
was
upstairs
*NL*
collecting
clothes
for
the
poor
Hummels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
very
splendid
show
,
but
there
was
a
great
deal
of
love
done
up
in
*NL*
the
few
little
bundles
;
and
the
tall
vase
of
red
roses
,
white
*NL*
chrysanthemums
,
and
trailing
vines
,
which
stood
in
the
middle
,
gave
*NL*
quite
an
elegant
air
to
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
coming
!
Strike
up
,
Beth
!
Open
the
door
,
Amy
!
Three
cheers
for
*NL*
Marmee
!
''
cried
Jo
,
prancing
about
,
while
Meg
went
to
conduct
mother
to
*NL*
the
seat
of
honor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
played
her
gayest
march
,
Amy
threw
open
the
door
,
and
Meg
enacted
*NL*
escort
with
great
dignity
.
Mrs.
March
was
both
surprised
and
touched
;
*NL*
and
smiled
with
her
eyes
full
as
she
examined
her
presents
,
and
read
the
*NL*
little
notes
which
accompanied
them
.
The
slippers
went
on
at
once
,
a
new
*NL*
handkerchief
was
slipped
into
her
pocket
,
well
scented
with
Amy
's
*NL*
cologne
,
the
rose
was
fastened
in
her
bosom
,
and
the
nice
gloves
were
*NL*
pronounced
a
``
perfect
fit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
good
deal
of
laughing
and
kissing
and
explaining
,
in
the
*NL*
simple
,
loving
fashion
which
makes
these
home-festivals
so
pleasant
at
*NL*
the
time
,
so
sweet
to
remember
long
afterward
,
and
then
all
fell
to
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
charities
and
ceremonies
took
so
much
time
that
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
day
was
devoted
to
preparations
for
the
evening
festivities
.
Being
*NL*
still
too
young
to
go
often
to
the
theatre
,
and
not
rich
enough
to
*NL*
afford
any
great
outlay
for
private
performances
,
the
girls
put
their
*NL*
wits
to
work
,
and
--
necessity
being
the
mother
of
invention
,
--
made
*NL*
whatever
they
needed
.
Very
clever
were
some
of
their
*NL*
productions
,
--
pasteboard
guitars
,
antique
lamps
made
of
old-fashioned
*NL*
butter-boats
covered
with
silver
paper
,
gorgeous
robes
of
old
cotton
,
*NL*
glittering
with
tin
spangles
from
a
pickle
factory
,
and
armor
covered
*NL*
with
the
same
useful
diamond-shaped
bits
,
left
in
sheets
when
the
lids
*NL*
of
tin
preserve-pots
were
cut
out
.
The
furniture
was
used
to
being
*NL*
turned
topsy-turvy
,
and
the
big
chamber
was
the
scene
of
many
innocent
*NL*
revels
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
gentlemen
were
admitted
;
so
Jo
played
male
parts
to
her
heart
's
*NL*
content
,
and
took
immense
satisfaction
in
a
pair
of
russet-leather
boots
*NL*
given
her
by
a
friend
,
who
knew
a
lady
who
knew
an
actor
.
These
boots
,
*NL*
an
old
foil
,
and
a
slashed
doublet
once
used
by
an
artist
for
some
*NL*
picture
,
were
Jo
's
chief
treasures
,
and
appeared
on
all
occasions
.
The
*NL*
smallness
of
the
company
made
it
necessary
for
the
two
principal
actors
*NL*
to
take
several
parts
apiece
;
and
they
certainly
deserved
some
credit
*NL*
for
the
hard
work
they
did
in
learning
three
or
four
different
parts
,
*NL*
whisking
in
and
out
of
various
costumes
,
and
managing
the
stage
besides
.
*NL*
It
was
excellent
drill
for
their
memories
,
a
harmless
amusement
,
and
*NL*
employed
many
hours
which
otherwise
would
have
been
idle
,
lonely
,
or
*NL*
spent
in
less
profitable
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Christmas
night
,
a
dozen
girls
piled
on
to
the
bed
which
was
the
*NL*
dress-circle
,
and
sat
before
the
blue
and
yellow
chintz
curtains
in
a
*NL*
most
flattering
state
of
expectancy
.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
rustling
*NL*
and
whispering
behind
the
curtain
,
a
trifle
of
lamp-smoke
,
and
an
*NL*
occasional
giggle
from
Amy
,
who
was
apt
to
get
hysterical
in
the
*NL*
excitement
of
the
moment
.
Presently
a
bell
sounded
,
the
curtains
flew
*NL*
apart
,
and
the
Operatic
Tragedy
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
gloomy
wood
,
''
according
to
the
one
play-bill
,
was
represented
by
a
*NL*
few
shrubs
in
pots
,
green
baize
on
the
floor
,
and
a
cave
in
the
*NL*
distance
.
This
cave
was
made
with
a
clothes-horse
for
a
roof
,
bureaus
*NL*
for
walls
;
and
in
it
was
a
small
furnace
in
full
blast
,
with
a
black
pot
*NL*
on
it
,
and
an
old
witch
bending
over
it
.
The
stage
was
dark
,
and
the
*NL*
glow
of
the
furnace
had
a
fine
effect
,
especially
as
real
steam
issued
*NL*
from
the
kettle
when
the
witch
took
off
the
cover
.
A
moment
was
allowed
*NL*
for
the
first
thrill
to
subside
;
then
Hugo
,
the
villain
,
stalked
in
with
*NL*
a
clanking
sword
at
his
side
,
a
slouched
hat
,
black
beard
,
mysterious
*NL*
cloak
,
and
the
boots
.
After
pacing
to
and
fro
in
much
agitation
,
he
*NL*
struck
his
forehead
,
and
burst
out
in
a
wild
strain
,
singing
of
his
*NL*
hatred
to
Roderigo
,
his
love
for
Zara
,
and
his
pleasing
resolution
to
*NL*
kill
the
one
and
win
the
other
.
The
gruff
tones
of
Hugo
's
voice
,
with
an
*NL*
occasional
shout
when
his
feelings
overcame
him
,
were
very
impressive
,
*NL*
and
the
audience
applauded
the
moment
he
paused
for
breath
.
Bowing
with
*NL*
the
air
of
one
accustomed
to
public
praise
,
he
stole
to
the
cavern
,
and
*NL*
ordered
Hagar
to
come
forth
with
a
commanding
``
What
ho
,
minion
!
I
need
*NL*
thee
!

Out
came
Meg
,
with
gray
horse-hair
hanging
about
her
face
,
a
red
and
*NL*
black
robe
,
a
staff
,
and
cabalistic
signs
upon
her
cloak

Hugo
demanded
*NL*
a
potion
to
make
Zara
adore
him
,
and
one
to
destroy
Roderigo
.
Hagar
,
in
*NL*
a
fine
dramatic
melody
,
promised
both
,
and
proceeded
to
call
up
the
*NL*
spirit
who
would
bring
the
love
philter
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hither
,
hither
,
from
thy

,
*NL*
Airy
sprite
,
I
bid
thee
come

*NL*
Born

Charms

canst
thou
brew
?
*NL*
Bring
me
here
,
with
elfin
speed
,
*NL*
The
fragrant
philter
which
I
need
;
*NL*
Make
it
sweet
and
swift
and
strong
,

answer
now
my
song

*NL*
A
soft
strain
of
music
sounded
,
and
then
at
the
back
of
the
cave
*NL*
appeared
a
little
figure
in
cloudy
white
,
with
glittering
wings
,
golden
*NL*
hair
,
and
a
garland
of
roses
on
its
head
.
Waving
a
wand
,
it
sang
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hither
I
come
,
*NL*
From
my
airy
home
,
*NL*
Afar
in
the
silver
moon
.
*NL*
Take
the
magic
spell
,
*NL*
And
use
it
well
,
*NL*
Or
its
power
will
vanish
soon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
dropping
a
small
,
gilded
bottle
at
the
witch
's
feet
,
the
spirit
*NL*
vanished
.
Another
chant
from
Hagar
produced
another
apparition
,
--
not
a
*NL*
lovely
one
;
for
,
with
a
bang
,
an
ugly
black
imp
appeared
,
and
,
having
*NL*
croaked
a
reply
,
tossed
a
dark
bottle
at
Hugo
,
and
disappeared
with
a
*NL*
mocking
laugh
.
Having
warbled
his
thanks
and
put
the
potions
in
his
*NL*
boots
,
Hugo
departed
;
and
Hagar
informed
the
audience
that
,
as
he
had
*NL*
killed
a
few
of
her
friends
in
times
past
,
she
has
cursed
him
,
and
*NL*
intends
to
thwart
his
plans
,
and
be
revenged
on
him
.
Then
the
curtain
*NL*
fell
,
and
the
audience
reposed
and
ate
candy
while
discussing
the
merits
*NL*
of
the
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
deal
of
hammering
went
on
before
the
curtain
rose
again
;
but
when
*NL*
it
became
evident
what
a
masterpiece
of
stage-carpentering
had
been
got
*NL*
up
,
no
one
murmured
at
the
delay
.
It
was
truly
superb
!
A
tower
rose
to
*NL*
the
ceiling
;
half-way
up
appeared
a
window
,
with
a
lamp
burning
at
it
,
*NL*
and
behind
the
white
curtain
appeared
Zara
in
a
lovely
blue
and
silver
*NL*
dress
,
waiting
for
Roderigo
.
He
came
in
gorgeous
array
,
with
plumed
cap
,
*NL*
red
cloak
,
chestnut
love-locks
,
a
guitar
,
and
the
boots
,
of
course
.
*NL*
Kneeling
at
the
foot
of
the
tower
,
he
sang
a
serenade
in
melting
tones
.
*NL*
Zara
replied
,
and
,
after
a
musical
dialogue
,
consented
to
fly
.
Then
came
*NL*
the
grand
effect
of
the
play
.
Roderigo
produced
a
rope-ladder
,
with
five
*NL*
steps
to
it
,
threw
up
one
end
,
and
invited
Zara
to
descend
.
Timidly
she
*NL*
crept
from
her
lattice
,
put
her
hand
on
Roderigo
's
shoulder
,
and
was
*NL*
about
to
leap
gracefully
down
,
when
,
``
Alas
!
alas
for
Zara
!
''
she
forgot
*NL*
her
train
,
--
it
caught
in
the
window
;
the
tower
tottered
,
leaned
forward
,
*NL*
fell
with
a
crash
,
and
buried
the
unhappy
lovers
in
the
ruins
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
universal
shriek
arose
as
the
russet
boots
waved
wildly
from
the
*NL*
wreck
,
and
a
golden
head
emerged
,
exclaiming
,
``
I
told
you
so
!
I
told
you
*NL*
so
!
''
With
wonderful
presence
of
mind
,
Don
Pedro
,
the
cruel
sire
,
rushed
*NL*
in
,
dragged
out
his
daughter
,
with
a
hasty
aside
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
laugh
!
Act
as
if
it
was
all
right
!
''
--
and
,
ordering
Roderigo
up
,
*NL*
banished
him
from
the
kingdom
with
wrath
and
scorn
.
Though
decidedly
*NL*
shaken
by
the
fall
of
the
tower
upon
him
,
Roderigo
defied
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
and
refused
to
stir
.
This
dauntless
example
fired
Zara
:
she
*NL*
also
defied
her
sire
,
and
he
ordered
them
both
to
the
deepest
dungeons
*NL*
of
the
castle
.
A
stout
little
retainer
came
in
with
chains
,
and
led
them
*NL*
away
,
looking
very
much
frightened
,
and
evidently
forgetting
the
speech
*NL*
he
ought
to
have
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Act
third
was
the
castle
hall
;
and
here
Hagar
appeared
,
having
come
to
*NL*
free
the
lovers
and
finish
Hugo
.
She
hears
him
coming
,
and
hides
;
sees
*NL*
him
put
the
potions
into
two
cups
of
wine
,
and
bid
the
timid
little
*NL*
servant
``
Bear
them
to
the
captives
in
their
cells
,
and
tell
them
I
shall
*NL*
come
anon
.
''
The
servant
takes
Hugo
aside
to
tell
him
something
,
and
*NL*
Hagar
changes
the
cups
for
two
others
which
are
harmless
.
Ferdinando
,
*NL*
the
``
minion
,
''
carries
them
away
,
and
Hagar
puts
back
the
cup
which
holds
*NL*
the
poison
meant
for
Roderigo
.
Hugo
,
getting
thirsty
after
a
long
*NL*
warble
,
drinks
it
,
loses
his
wits
,
and
,
after
a
good
deal
of
clutching
*NL*
and
stamping
,
falls
flat
and
dies
;
while
Hagar
informs
him
what
she
has
*NL*
done
in
a
song
of
exquisite
power
and
melody
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
truly
thrilling
scene
,
though
some
persons
might
have
thought
*NL*
that
the
sudden
tumbling
down
of
a
quantity
of
long
hair
rather
marred
*NL*
the
effect
of
the
villain
's
death
.
He
was
called
before
the
curtain
,
and
*NL*
with
great
propriety
appeared
,
leading
Hagar
,
whose
singing
was
*NL*
considered
more
wonderful
than
all
the
rest
of
the
performance
put
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Act
fourth
displayed
the
despairing
Roderigo
on
the
point
of
stabbing
*NL*
himself
,
because
he
has
been
told
that
Zara
has
deserted
him
.
Just
as
*NL*
the
dagger
is
at
his
heart
,
a
lovely
song
is
sung
under
his
window
,
*NL*
informing
him
that
Zara
is
true
,
but
in
danger
,
and
he
can
save
her
,
if
*NL*
he
will
.
A
key
is
thrown
in
,
which
unlocks
the
door
,
and
in
a
spasm
of
*NL*
rapture
he
tears
off
his
chains
,
and
rushes
away
to
find
and
rescue
his
*NL*
lady-love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Act
fifth
opened
with
a
stormy
scene
between
Zara
and
Don
Pedro
.
He
*NL*
wishes
her
to
go
into
a
convent
,
but
she
wo
n't
hear
of
it
;
and
,
after
a
*NL*
touching
appeal
,
is
about
to
faint
,
when
Roderigo
dashes
in
and
demands
*NL*
her
hand
.
Don
Pedro
refuses
,
because
he
is
not
rich
.
They
shout
and
*NL*
gesticulate
tremendously
,
but
can
not
agree
,
and
Roderigo
is
about
to
*NL*
bear
away
the
exhausted
Zara
,
when
the
timid
servant
enters
with
a
*NL*
letter
and
a
bag
from
Hagar
,
who
has
mysteriously
disappeared
.
The
*NL*
latter
informs
the
party
that
she
bequeaths
untold
wealth
to
the
young
*NL*
pair
,
and
an
awful
doom
to
Don
Pedro
,
if
he
does
n't
make
them
happy
.
The
*NL*
bag
is
opened
,
and
several
quarts
of
tin
money
shower
down
upon
the
*NL*
stage
,
till
it
is
quite
glorified
with
the
glitter
.
This
entirely
*NL*
softens
the
``
stern
sire
''
:
he
consents
without
a
murmur
,
all
join
in
a
*NL*
joyful
chorus
,
and
the
curtain
falls
upon
the
lovers
kneeling
to
receive
*NL*
Don
Pedro
's
blessing
in
attitudes
of
the
most
romantic
grace
.

*NL*
*NL*
Tumultuous
applause
followed
,
but
received
an
unexpected
check
;
for
the
*NL*
cot-bed
,
on
which
the
``
dress-circle
''
was
built
,
suddenly
shut
up
,
and
*NL*
extinguished
the
enthusiastic
audience
.
Roderigo
and
Don
Pedro
flew
to
*NL*
the
rescue
,
and
all
were
taken
out
unhurt
,
though
many
were
speechless
*NL*
with
laughter
.
The
excitement
had
hardly
subsided
,
when
Hannah
appeared
,
*NL*
with
``
Mrs.
March
's
compliments
,
and
would
the
ladies
walk
down
to
*NL*
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
surprise
,
even
to
the
actors
;
and
,
when
they
saw
the
table
,
*NL*
they
looked
at
one
another
in
rapturous
amazement
.
It
was
like
Marmee
to
*NL*
get
up
a
little
treat
for
them
;
but
anything
so
fine
as
this
was
*NL*
unheard-of
since
the
departed
days
of
plenty
.
There
was
*NL*
ice-cream
,
--
actually
two
dishes
of
it
,
pink
and
white
,
--
and
cake
and
*NL*
fruit
and
distracting
French
bonbons
,
and
,
in
the
middle
of
the
table
,
*NL*
four
great
bouquets
of
hot-house
flowers
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
quite
took
their
breath
away
;
and
they
stared
first
at
the
table
and
*NL*
then
at
their
mother
,
who
looked
as
if
she
enjoyed
it
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
fairies
?
''
asked
Amy
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
Santa
Claus
,
''
said
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
did
it
''
;
and
Meg
smiled
her
sweetest
,
in
spite
of
her
gray
beard
*NL*
and
white
eyebrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
March
had
a
good
fit
,
and
sent
the
supper
,
''
cried
Jo
,
with
a
*NL*
sudden
inspiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
wrong
.
Old
Mr.
Laurence
sent
it
,
''
replied
Mrs.
March
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Laurence
boy
's
grandfather

What
in
the
world
put
such
a
thing
into
*NL*
his
head

We
do
n't
know
him
!
''
exclaimed
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hannah
told
one
of
his
servants
about
your
breakfast
party
.
He
is
an
*NL*
odd
old
gentleman
,
but
that
pleased
him
.
He
knew
my
father
,
years
ago
;
*NL*
and
he
sent
me
a
polite
note
this
afternoon
,
saying
he
hoped
I
would
*NL*
allow
him
to
express
his
friendly
feeling
toward
my
children
by
sending
*NL*
them
a
few
trifles
in
honor
of
the
day
.
I
could
not
refuse
;
and
so
you
*NL*
have
a
little
feast
at
night
to
make
up
for
the
bread-and-milk
*NL*
breakfast

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

put
it
into

I
know
he
did
!
He
's
a
capital
fellow

and
I
wish
we
could
get
acquainted
.
He
looks
as
if
he
'd
like
to
know
us
;
*NL*
but
he
's
bashful
,
and
Meg
is
so
prim
she
wo
n't
let
me
speak
to
him
when
*NL*
we
pass
,
''
said
Jo
,
as
the
plates
went
round
,
and
the
ice
began
to
melt
*NL*
out
of
sight
,
with
``
Ohs
!
''
and
``
Ahs
!
''
of
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
the
people
who
live
in
the
big
house
next
door

you

*NL*
asked
one
of
the
girls
.
``
My
mother
knows

Mr.
Laurence
;
but
says
he
's
*NL*
very
proud

and
does
n't
like
to
mix
with
his
neighbors

He
keeps
his
*NL*
grandson
shut
up
,
when
he
is
n't
riding
or
walking
with
his
tutor
,
and
*NL*
makes
him
study
very
hard

We
invited
him
to
our
party
,
but
he
did
n't
*NL*
come

Mother
says
he

very
nice

he
never
speaks
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
cat
ran
away
once
,
and
he
brought
her
back
,
and
we
talked
over
the

fence

were
getting
on
capitally

all
about
cricket
,
and
so
*NL*
on
,

when
he
saw
Meg
coming

walked
off

I

know
him
some

day

needs
fun

frolic

THE

``

cried
Meg
,
at
the
foot
of
the
garret
stairs

*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
!

answered
a
husky
voice
from
above
;
and
,
running
up
,
Meg
found
*NL*
her
sister
eating
apples
and
crying
over
the
``
Heir
of
Redclyffe
,
''
*NL*
wrapped
up
in
a
comforter
on
an
old
three-legged
sofa
by
the
sunny
*NL*
window
.
This
was
Jo
's
favorite
refuge
;
and
here
she
loved
to
retire
with
*NL*
half
a
dozen
russets
and
a
nice
book
,
to
enjoy
the
quiet
and
the
society
*NL*
of
a
pet
rat
who
lived
near
by
,
and
did
n't
mind
her
a
particle

As
Meg

appeared

Scrabble
whisked
into

hole

Jo
shook
the
tears
off

``
Your

are
bigger
than
mine
,
and
you
will
stretch
my
glove
*NL*
dreadfully
,
''
began
Meg
,
whose
gloves
were
a
tender
point
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
go
without
.
I
do
n't
care
what
people
say

cried
Jo
,
taking
*NL*
up
her
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
have
it

you
may

only
do
n't
stain
it

behave
nicely

Do

behind

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

worry
about
me

I
'll
be
as
prim

I

*NL*
scrapes
,
if
I
can
help
it

Now
go
and
answer
your
note
,
and
let
me
*NL*
finish
this
splendid
story

*NL*
*NL*
So
Meg
went
away
to
``
accept
with
thanks
,
''
look
over
her
dress
,
and
sing
*NL*
blithely
as
she
did
up
her
one
real
lace
frill
;
while
Jo
finished
her
*NL*
story
,
her
four
apples
,
and
had
a
game
of
romps
with
Scrabble
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
New-Year
's
Eve
the
parlor
was
deserted
,
for
the
two
younger
girls
*NL*
played
dressing-maids
,
and
the
two
elder
were
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
all-important
business
of
``
getting
ready
for
the
party
.
''
Simple
as
the
*NL*
toilets
were
,
there
was
a
great
deal
of
running
up
and
down
,
laughing
*NL*
and
talking
,
and
at
one
time
a
strong
smell
of
burnt
hair
pervaded
the
*NL*
house
.
Meg
wanted
a
few
curls
about
her
face
,
and
Jo
undertook
to
pinch
*NL*
the
papered
locks
with
a
pair
of
hot
tongs
.

``

asked
Beth
,
from
her
perch
on
the
bed

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

the
dampness

Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

it

observed
Amy
,
smoothing
*NL*
her
own
pretty
curls
with
a
superior
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
I
'll
take
off
the
papers

you
'll
see
a
cloud
of
little

said
Jo
,
putting
down
the
tongs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
take
off
the
papers
,
but
no
cloud
of
ringlets
appeared
,
for
the
*NL*
hair
came
with
the
papers
,
and
the
horrified
hair-dresser
laid
a
row
of
*NL*
little
scorched
bundles
on
the
bureau
before
her
victim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

wailed
Meg
,
looking
with
despair
at
the
uneven
frizzle
on
her
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
my
luck

you

I
'm
so
sorry
,
but
the
tongs
were
too
hot
,
and
so
I
've
made
a
*NL*
mess
,

groaned
poor
Jo
,
regarding
the
black
pancakes
with
tears
of
*NL*
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
spoilt

just
frizzle
it

and
tie
your
ribbon
so
the
ends
come
*NL*
on
your
forehead
a
bit
,
and
it
will
look
like
the
last
fashion

I
've
*NL*
seen
many
girls
do
it
so
,

said
Amy
consolingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Serves
me
right
for
trying
to
be
fine

I
wish
I
'd
let
my

alone

*NL*
cried
Meg
petulantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

I
,
it
was
so
smooth
and
pretty

But
it
will
soon
grow
out
again

*NL*
said
Beth
,
coming
to
kiss
and
comfort
the
shorn
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
various
lesser
mishaps
,
Meg
was
finished
at
last
,
and
by
the
*NL*
united
exertions
of
the
family
Jo
's
hair
was
got
up
and
her
dress
on
.
*NL*
They
looked
very
well
in
their
simple
suits
,
--
Meg
in
silvery
drab
,
with
*NL*
a
blue
velvet
snood
,
lace
frills
,
and
the
pearl
pin
;
Jo
in
maroon
,
with
*NL*
a
stiff
,
gentlemanly
linen
collar
,
and
a
white
chrysanthemum
or
two
for
*NL*
her
only
ornament
.
Each
put
on
one
nice
light
glove
,
and
carried
one
*NL*
soiled
one
,
and
all
pronounced
the
effect
``
quite
easy
and
fine
.
''
Meg
's
*NL*
high-heeled
slippers
were
very
tight
,
and
hurt
her
,
though
she
would
not
*NL*
own
it
,
and
Jo
's
nineteen
hair-pins
all
seemed
stuck
straight
into
her
*NL*
head
,
which
was
not
exactly
comfortable
;
but
,
dear
me
,
let
us
be
elegant
*NL*
or
die
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
a
good
time

said
Mrs.
March
,
as
the
sisters
went
*NL*
daintily
down
the
walk
.
``
Do
n't
eat
much
supper

come
away
at
eleven
,
*NL*
when
I
send

''
As
the
gate
clashed
behind
them
,
a
voice
*NL*
cried
from
a
window
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Girls

*NL*
``

cried
Jo
,
adding
,
*NL*
with
a
laugh
,
as
they
went
on
,
``
I
do
believe
Marmee
would
ask
that

we
*NL*
were
all
running
away
from
an
earthquake

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

one

aristocratic

neat
boots

replied
Meg
,
*NL*
who
had
a
good
many
little
``
aristocratic
tastes

of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

n't

said
Meg
,
as
she
turned
from
*NL*
the
glass
in
Mrs.
Gardiner
's
dressing-room
,
after
a
prolonged
prink
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

remind

will
you

returned
Jo
,
giving
her
collar
a
twitch
and
her
*NL*
head
a
hasty
brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

winking

I

lift
my

Mrs.
Gardiner
greeted
them
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Down
they
went
,
feeling
a
trifle
timid
,
for
they
seldom
went
to
parties
,
*NL*
and
,
informal
as
this
little
gathering
was
,
it
was
an
event
to
them
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Gardiner
,
a
stately
old
lady
,
greeted
them
kindly
,
and
handed
them
*NL*
over
to
the
eldest
of
her
six
daughters
.
Meg
knew
Sallie
,
and
was
at
her
*NL*
ease
very
soon
;
but
Jo
,
who
did
n't
care
much
for
girls
or
girlish
*NL*
gossip
,
stood
about
,
with
her
back
carefully
against
the
wall
,
and
felt
*NL*
as
much
out
of
place
as
a
colt
in
a
flower-garden
.
Half
a
dozen
jovial
*NL*
lads
were
talking
about
skates
in
another
part
of
the
room
,
and
she
*NL*
longed
to
go
and
join
them
,
for
skating
was
one
of
the
joys
of
her
life
.
*NL*
She
telegraphed
her
wish
to
Meg
,
but
the
eyebrows
went
up
so
alarmingly
*NL*
that
she
dared
not
stir
.
No
one
came
to
talk
to
her
,
and
one
by
one
the
*NL*
group
near
her
dwindled
away
,
till
she
was
left
alone
.
She
could
not
*NL*
roam
about
and
amuse
herself
,
for
the
burnt
breadth
would
show
,
so
she
*NL*
stared
at
people
rather
forlornly
till
the
dancing
began
.
Meg
was
asked
*NL*
at
once
,
and
the
tight
slippers
tripped
about
so
briskly
that
none
would
*NL*
have
guessed
the
pain
their
wearer
suffered
smilingly
.
Jo
saw
a
big
*NL*
redheaded
youth
approaching
her
corner
,
and
fearing
he
meant
to
engage
*NL*
her
,
she
slipped
into
a
curtained
recess
,
intending
to
peep
and
enjoy
*NL*
herself
in
peace
.
Unfortunately
,
another
bashful
person
had
chosen
the
*NL*
same
refuge
;
for
,
as
the
curtain
fell
behind
her
,
she
found
herself
face
*NL*
to
face
with
the
``
Laurence
boy
.

``
Dear

stammered
Jo
,
preparing
to
*NL*
back
out
as
speedily
as
she
had
bounced
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
boy
laughed
,
and
said
pleasantly
,
though
he
looked
a
little
*NL*
startled
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
me
;
stay
,
if

*NL*
``

'n'

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a

I
only
came
here

strange
at

``

I.

*NL*
The
boy
sat
down
again
and
looked
at
his
pumps
,
till
Jo
said
,
trying
to
*NL*
be
polite
and
easy
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
've
had
the
pleasure

seeing
you

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Next
door

;
and
he
looked
up
and
laughed
outright
,
for
Jo
's
prim
manner
*NL*
was
rather
funny
when
he
remembered
how
they
had
chatted
about
cricket
*NL*
when
he
brought
the
cat
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
put
Jo
at
her
ease
;
and
she
laughed
too
,
as
she
said
,
in
her
*NL*
heartiest
way
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
have
such
a

asked
the
boy
,
trying
to
look
sober
,
*NL*
while
his
black
eyes
shone
with
fun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

with
a
sigh

looking

suited

*NL*
``

*NL*
Laurie
did
n't
seem
to
know
where
to
begin
;
but
Jo
's
eager
questions
soon
*NL*
set
him
going
,
and
he
told
her
how
he
had
been
at
school
in
Vevay
,
where
*NL*
the
boys
never
wore
hats
,
and
had
a
fleet
of
boats
on
the
lake
,
and
for
*NL*
holiday
fun
went
walking
trips
about
Switzerland
with
their
teachers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

there

cried
Jo

``
Did

good-naturedly

*NL*
``

peeped
and
criticised
and
chatted
,
*NL*
till
they
felt
like
old
acquaintances
.
Laurie
's
bashfulness
soon
wore
*NL*
off
;
for
Jo
's
gentlemanly
demeanor
amused
and
set
him
at
his
ease
,
and
*NL*
Jo
was
her
merry
self
again
,
because
her
dress
was
forgotten
,
and
nobody
*NL*
lifted
their
eyebrows
at
her
.
She
liked
the
``
Laurence
boy
''
better
than
*NL*
ever
,
and
took
several
good
looks
at
him
,
so
that
she
might
describe
him
*NL*
to
the
girls
;
for
they
had
no
brothers
,
very
few
male
cousins
,
and
boys
*NL*
were
almost
unknown
creatures
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Curly
black
hair
;
brown
skin
;
big
,
black
eyes
;
handsome
nose
;
fine
*NL*
teeth
;
small
hands
and
feet
;
taller
than
I
am
;
very
polite
,
for
a
boy
,
*NL*
and
altogether
jolly
.
Wonder
how
old
he
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
on
the
tip
of
Jo
's
tongue
to
ask
;
but
she
checked
herself
in
*NL*
time
,
and
,
with
unusual
tact
,
tried
to
find
out
in
a
roundabout
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
are
going
to
college
soon
?
I
see
you
pegging
away
at
your
*NL*
books
,
--
no
,
I
mean
studying
hard
''
;
and
Jo
blushed
at
the
dreadful
*NL*
``
pegging
''
which
had
escaped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
smiled
,
but
did
n't
seem
shocked
,
and
answered
,
with
a
shrug
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
for
a
year
or
two
;
I
wo
n't
go
before
seventeen
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
but
fifteen
?
''
asked
Jo
,
looking
at
the
tall
lad
,
whom
she
*NL*
had
imagined
seventeen
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
,
next
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
I
wish
I
was
going
to
college
!
You
do
n't
look
as
if
you
liked
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
it
!
Nothing
but
grinding
or
skylarking
.
And
I
do
n't
like
the
way
*NL*
fellows
do
either
,
in
this
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
like
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
live
in
Italy
,
and
to
enjoy
myself
in
my
own
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
wanted
very
much
to
ask
what
his
own
way
was
;
but
his
black
brows
*NL*
looked
rather
threatening
as
he
knit
them
;
so
she
changed
the
subject
by
*NL*
saying
,
as
her
foot
kept
time
,
``
That
's
a
splendid
polka
!
Why
do
n't
you
*NL*
go
and
try
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
come
too
,
''
he
answered
,
with
a
gallant
little
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
;
for
I
told
Meg
I
would
n't
,
because
--
''
There
Jo
stopped
,
and
*NL*
looked
undecided
whether
to
tell
or
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
what
?
''
asked
Laurie
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
tell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
have
a
bad
trick
of
standing
before
the
fire
,
and
so
I
burn
my
*NL*
frocks
,
and
I
scorched
this
one
;
and
,
though
it
's
nicely
mended
,
it
*NL*
shows
,
and
Meg
told
me
to
keep
still
,
so
no
one
would
see
it
.
You
may
*NL*
laugh
,
if
you
want
to
;
it
is
funny
,
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Laurie
did
n't
laugh
;
he
only
looked
down
a
minute
,
and
the
*NL*
expression
of
his
face
puzzled
Jo
,
when
he
said
very
gently
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
that
;
I
'll
tell
you
how
we
can
manage
:
there
's
a
long
hall
*NL*
out
there
,
and
we
can
dance
grandly
,
and
no
one
will
see
us
.
Please
*NL*
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
thanked
him
,
and
gladly
went
,
wishing
she
had
two
neat
gloves
,
when
*NL*
she
saw
the
nice
,
pearl-colored
ones
her
partner
wore
.
The
hall
was
*NL*
empty
,
and
they
had
a
grand
polka
;
for
Laurie
danced
well
,
and
taught
*NL*
her
the
German
step
,
which
delighted
Jo
,
being
full
of
swing
and
spring
.
*NL*
When
the
music
stopped
,
they
sat
down
on
the
stairs
to
get
their
breath
;
*NL*
and
Laurie
was
in
the
midst
of
an
account
of
a
students
'
festival
at
*NL*
Heidelberg
,
when
Meg
appeared
in
search
of
her
sister
.
She
beckoned
,
and
*NL*
Jo
reluctantly
followed
her
into
a
side-room
,
where
she
found
her
on
a
*NL*
sofa
,
holding
her
foot
,
and
looking
pale
.
*NL*
*NL*

They
sat
down
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sprained
my
ankle
.
That
stupid
high
heel
turned
,
and
gave
me
a
sad
*NL*
wrench
.
It
aches
so
,
I
can
hardly
stand
,
and
I
do
n't
know
how
I
'm
ever
*NL*
going
to
get
home
,
''
she
said
,
rocking
to
and
fro
in
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
you
'd
hurt
your
feet
with
those
silly
shoes

I
'm
sorry

But
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
what
you
can
do
,
except
get
a
carriage
,
or
stay
here
all
*NL*
night

''
answered
Jo
,
softly
rubbing
the
poor
ankle
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
have
a
carriage
,
without
its
costing
ever
so
much
.
I
dare
say
I
*NL*
ca
n't
get
one
at
all
;
for
most
people
come
in
their
own
,
and
it
's
a
long
*NL*
way
to
the
stable
,
and
no
one
to
send
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
!
It
's
past
nine
,
and
dark
as
Egypt
.
I
ca
n't
stop
here
,
for
*NL*
the
house
is
full
.
Sallie
has
some
girls
staying
with
her
.
I
'll
rest
*NL*
till
Hannah
comes
,
and
then
do
the
best
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
ask
Laurie
;
he
will
go
,
''
said
Jo
,
looking
relieved
as
the
idea
*NL*
occurred
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
,
no
!
Do
n't
ask
or
tell
any
one
.
Get
me
my
rubbers
,
and
put
these
*NL*
slippers
with
our
things
.
I
ca
n't
dance
any
more
;
but
as
soon
as
supper
*NL*
is
over
,
watch
for
Hannah
,
and
tell
me
the
minute
she
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
going
out
to
supper
now

I
'll
stay
with
you
;
I
'd
rather

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
run
along
,
and
bring
me
some
coffee
.
I
'm
so
tired
,
I
ca
n't
*NL*
stir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Meg
reclined
,
with
rubbers
well
hidden
,
and
Jo
went
blundering
away
*NL*
to
the
dining-room
,
which
she
found
after
going
into
a
china-closet
,
and
*NL*
opening
the
door
of
a
room
where
old
Mr.
Gardiner
was
taking
a
little
*NL*
private
refreshment
.
Making
a
dart
at
the
table
,
she
secured
the
coffee
,
*NL*
which
she
immediately
spilt
,
thereby
making
the
front
of
her
dress
as
*NL*
bad
as
the
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
what
a
blunderbuss
I
am
!
''
exclaimed
Jo
,
finishing
Meg
's
glove
*NL*
by
scrubbing
her
gown
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
help
you
?
''
said
a
friendly
voice
;
and
there
was
Laurie
,
with
a
*NL*
full
cup
in
one
hand
and
a
plate
of
ice
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
trying
to
get
something
for
Meg
,
who
is
very
tired
,
and
some
one
*NL*
shook
me
;
and
here
I
am
,
in
a
nice
state
,
''
answered
Jo
,
glancing
*NL*
dismally
from
the
stained
skirt
to
the
coffee-colored
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
bad
!
I
was
looking
for
some
one
to
give
this
to
.
May
I
take
it
to
*NL*
your
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
you
!
I
'll
show
you
where
she
is
.
I
do
n't
offer
to
take
it
*NL*
myself
,
for
I
should
only
get
into
another
scrape
if
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
led
the
way
;
and
,
as
if
used
to
waiting
on
ladies
,
Laurie
drew
up
a
*NL*
little
table
,
brought
a
second
instalment
of
coffee
and
ice
for
Jo
,
and
*NL*
was
so
obliging
that
even
particular
Meg
pronounced
him
a
``
nice
boy
.
''
*NL*
They
had
a
merry
time
over
the
bonbons
and
mottoes
,
and
were
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
a
quiet
game
of
``
Buzz
,
''
with
two
or
three
other
young
people
*NL*
who
had
strayed
in
,
when
Hannah
appeared
.
Meg
forgot
her
foot
,
and
rose
*NL*
so
quickly
that
she
was
forced
to
catch
hold
of
Jo
,
with
an
exclamation
*NL*
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
Do
n't
say
anything
,
''
she
whispered
,
adding
aloud
,
``
It
's
nothing
.
*NL*
I
turned
my
foot
a
little
,
that
's
all
''
;
and
limped
up-stairs
to
put
her
*NL*
things
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hannah
scolded
,
Meg
cried
,
and
Jo
was
at
her
wits
'
end
,
till
she
*NL*
decided
to
take
things
into
her
own
hands
.
Slipping
out
,
she
ran
down
,
*NL*
and
,
finding
a
servant
,
asked
if
he
could
get
her
a
carriage
.
It
*NL*
happened
to
be
a
hired
waiter
,
who
knew
nothing
about
the
neighborhood
;
*NL*
and
Jo
was
looking
round
for
help
,
when
Laurie
,
who
had
heard
what
she
*NL*
said
,
came
up
,
and
offered
his
grandfather
's
carriage
,
which
had
just
*NL*
come
for
him
,
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
early
!
You
ca
n't
mean
to
go
yet
?
''
began
Jo
,
looking
relieved
,
*NL*
but
hesitating
to
accept
the
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
go
early
,
--
I
do
,
truly
!
Please
let
me
take
you
home
?
It
's
all
*NL*
on
my
way
,
you
know
,
and
it
rains
,
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
settled
it
;
and
,
telling
him
of
Meg
's
mishap
,
Jo
gratefully
*NL*
accepted
,
and
rushed
up
to
bring
down
the
rest
of
the
party
.
Hannah
*NL*
hated
rain
as
much
as
a
cat
does
;
so
she
made
no
trouble
,
and
they
*NL*
rolled
away
in
the
luxurious
close
carriage
,
feeling
very
festive
and
*NL*
elegant
.
Laurie
went
on
the
box
;
so
Meg
could
keep
her
foot
up
,
and
the
*NL*
girls
talked
over
their
party
in
freedom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
capital
time
.
Did
you
?
''
asked
Jo
,
rumpling
up
her
hair
,
and
*NL*
making
herself
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
till
I
hurt
myself
.
Sallie
's
friend
,
Annie
Moffat
,
took
a
fancy
to
*NL*
me
,
and
asked
me
to
come
and
spend
a
week
with
her
,
when
Sallie
does
.
*NL*
She
is
going
in
the
spring
,
when
the
opera
comes
;
and
it
will
be
*NL*
perfectly
splendid
,
if
mother
only
lets
me
go
,
''
answered
Meg
,
cheering
*NL*
up
at
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
dancing
with
the
red-headed
man
I
ran
away
from
.
Was
he
*NL*
nice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
!
His
hair
is
auburn
,
not
red
;
and
he
was
very
polite
,
and
I
*NL*
had
a
delicious
redowa
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
looked
like
a
grasshopper
in
a
fit
,
when
he
did
the
new
step
.
Laurie
*NL*
and
I
could
n't
help
laughing
.
Did
you
hear
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
it
was
very
rude
.
What
_
were
_
you
about
all
that
time
,
hidden
*NL*
away
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
told
her
adventures
,
and
,
by
the
time
she
had
finished
,
they
were
at
*NL*
home
.
With
many
thanks
,
they
said
``
Good
night
,
''
and
crept
in
,
hoping
to
*NL*
disturb
no
one
;
but
the
instant
their
door
creaked
,
two
little
*NL*
night-caps
bobbed
up
,
and
two
sleepy
but
eager
voices
cried
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
about
the
party
!
tell
about
the
party
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
what
Meg
called
``
a
great
want
of
manners
,
''
Jo
had
saved
some
*NL*
bonbons
for
the
little
girls
;
and
they
soon
subsided
,
after
hearing
the
*NL*
most
thrilling
events
of
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
declare
,
it
really
seems
like
being
a
fine
young
lady
,
to
come
home
*NL*
from
the
party
in
a
carriage
,
and
sit
in
my
dressing-gown
,
with
a
maid
*NL*
to
wait
on
me
,
''
said
Meg
,
as
Jo
bound
up
her
foot
with
arnica
,
and
*NL*
brushed
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
fine
young
ladies
enjoy
themselves
a
bit
more
than
we
*NL*
do
,
in
spite
of
our
burnt
hair
,
old
gowns
,
one
glove
apiece
,
and
tight
*NL*
slippers
that
sprain
our
ankles
when
we
are
silly
enough
to
wear
them

*NL*
And
I
think
Jo
was
quite
right

sighed
*NL*
Meg
,
the
morning
after
the
party
;
for
,
now
the
holidays
were
over
,
the
*NL*
week
of
merry-making
did
not
fit
her
for
going

easily

the
task
*NL*
she
never
liked

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

would
n't
it
be
fun

answered
Jo
,
yawning
dismally
.

*NL*
``
We

so

so
nice
to
have
little
suppers
and
bouquets
,
and
go
to
parties
,
and
*NL*
drive
home
,
and
read
and
rest
,
and
not
work
.
It
's
like
other
people
,
*NL*
you
know
,
and
I
always
envy
girls
who
do
such
things
;
I
'm
so
fond
of
*NL*
luxury
,
''
said
Meg
,
trying
to
decide
which
of
two
shabby
gowns
was
the
*NL*
least
shabby
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
ca
n't
have
it
,
so
do
n't
let
us
grumble
,
but
shoulder
our
*NL*
bundles
and
trudge
along
as
cheerfully
as
Marmee
does
.
I
'm
sure
Aunt
*NL*
March
is
a
regular
Old
Man
of
the
Sea
to
me
,
but
I
suppose
when
I
've
*NL*
learned
to
carry
her
without
complaining
,
she
will
tumble
off
,
or
get
so
*NL*
light
that
I
sha
'n'
t
mind
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
tickled
Jo
's
fancy
,
and
put
her
in
good
spirits
;
but
Meg
*NL*
did
n't
brighten
,
for
her
burden
,
consisting
of
four
spoilt
children
,
*NL*
seemed
heavier
than
ever
.
She
had
n't
heart
enough
even
to
make
herself
*NL*
pretty
,
as
usual
,
by
putting
on
a
blue
neck-ribbon
,
and
dressing
her
*NL*
hair
in
the
most
becoming
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
use
of
looking
nice
,
when
no
one
sees
me
but
those
cross
*NL*
midgets
,
and
no
one
cares
whether
I
'm
pretty
or
not
?
''
she
muttered
,
*NL*
shutting
her
drawer
with
a
jerk
.
``
I
shall
have
to
toil
and
moil
all
my
*NL*
days
,
with
only
little
bits
of
fun
now
and
then
,
and
get
old
and
ugly
*NL*
and
sour
,
because
I
'm
poor
,
and
ca
n't
enjoy
my
life
as
other
girls
do
.
*NL*
It
's
a
shame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Meg
went
down
,
wearing
an
injured
look
,
and
was
n't
at
all
agreeable
*NL*
at
breakfast-time
.
Every
one
seemed
rather
out
of
sorts
,
and
inclined
to
*NL*
croak
.
Beth
had
a
headache
,
and
lay
on
the
sofa
,
trying
to
comfort
*NL*
herself
with
the
cat
and
three
kittens
;
Amy
was
fretting
because
her
*NL*
lessons
were
not
learned
,
and
she
could
n't
find
her
rubbers
;
Jo
_
would
_
*NL*
whistle
and
make
a
great
racket
getting
ready
;
Mrs.
March
was
very
busy
*NL*
trying
to
finish
a
letter
,
which
must
go
at
once
;
and
Hannah
had
the
*NL*
grumps
,
for
being
up
late
did
n't
suit
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
never
_
was
_
such
a
cross
family
!
''
cried
Jo
,
losing
her
temper
*NL*
when
she
had
upset
an
inkstand
,
broken
both
boot-lacings
,
and
sat
down
*NL*
upon
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
the
crossest
person
in
it
!
''
returned
Amy
,
washing
out
the
sum
,
*NL*
that
was
all
wrong
,
with
the
tears
that
had
fallen
on
her
slate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beth
,
if
you
do
n't
keep
these
horrid
cats
down
cellar
I
'll
have
them
*NL*
drowned
,
''
exclaimed
Meg
angrily
,
as
she
tried
to
get
rid
of
the
kitten
,
*NL*
which
had
scrambled
up
her
back
,
and
stuck
like
a
burr
just
out
of
*NL*
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
laughed
,
Meg
scolded
,
Beth
implored
,
and
Amy
wailed
,
because
she
*NL*
could
n't
remember
how
much
nine
times
twelve
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Girls
,
girls
,
do
be
quiet
one
minute
!
I
_
must
_
get
this
off
by
the
*NL*
early
mail
,
and
you
drive
me
distracted
with
your
worry
,
''
cried
Mrs.
*NL*
March
,
crossing
out
the
third
spoilt
sentence
in
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
momentary
lull
,
broken
by
Hannah
,
who
stalked
in
,
laid
two
*NL*
hot
turn-overs
on
the
table
,
and
stalked
out
again
.
These
turn-overs
*NL*
were
an
institution
;
and
the
girls
called
them
``
muffs
,
''
for
they
had
no
*NL*
others
,
and
found
the
hot
pies
very
comforting
to
their
hands
on
cold
*NL*
mornings
.
Hannah
never
forgot
to
make
them
,
no
matter
how
busy
or
grumpy
*NL*
she
might
be
,
for
the
walk
was
long
and
bleak
;
the
poor
things
got
no
*NL*
other
lunch
,
and
were
seldom
home
before
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cuddle
your
cats
,
and
get
over
your
headache
,
Bethy
.
Good-by
,
Marmee
;
*NL*
we
are
a
set
of
rascals
this
morning
,
but
we
'll
come
home
regular
*NL*
angels
.
Now
then
,
Meg
!
''
and
Jo
tramped
away
,
feeling
that
the
pilgrims
*NL*
were
not
setting
out
as
they
ought
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
always
looked
back
before
turning
the
corner
,
for
their
mother
was
*NL*
always
at
the
window
,
to
nod
and
smile
,
and
wave
her
hand
to
them
.
*NL*
Somehow
it
seemed
as
if
they
could
n't
have
got
through
the
day
without
*NL*
that
;
for
,
whatever
their
mood
might
be
,
the
last
glimpse
of
that
*NL*
motherly
face
was
sure
to
affect
them
like
sunshine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Marmee
shook
her
fist
instead
of
kissing
her
hand
to
us
,
it
would
*NL*
serve
us
right
,
for
more
ungrateful
wretches
than
we
are
were
never
*NL*
seen
,
''
cried
Jo
,
taking
a
remorseful
satisfaction
in
the
snowy
walk
and
*NL*
bitter
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
use
such
dreadful
expressions
,
''
said
Meg
,
from
the
depths
of
the
*NL*
vail
in
which
she
had
shrouded
herself
like
a
nun
sick
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
good
strong
words
,
that
mean
something
,
''
replied
Jo
,
catching
*NL*
her
hat
as
it
took
a
leap
off
her
head
,
preparatory
to
flying
away
*NL*
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Call
yourself
any
names
you
like
;
but
_
I
_
am
neither
a
rascal
nor
a
*NL*
wretch

and
I
do
n't
choose
to
be
called
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
blighted
being
,
and
decidedly
cross
to-day
because
you
ca
n't
*NL*
sit
in
the
lap
of
luxury
all
the
time
.
Poor
dear
,
just
wait
till
I
make
*NL*
my
fortune
,
and
you
shall
revel
in
carriages
and
ice-cream
and
*NL*
high-heeled
slippers
and
posies
and
red-headed
boys
to
dance
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
ridiculous
you
are
,
Jo
!
''
but
Meg
laughed
at
the
nonsense
,
and
felt
*NL*
better
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucky
for
you
I
am
;
for
if
I
put
on
crushed
airs
,
and
tried
to
be
*NL*
dismal
,
as
you
do
,
we
should
be
in
a
nice
state
.
Thank
goodness
,
I
can
*NL*
always
find
something
funny
to
keep
me
up
.
Do
n't
croak
any
more
,
but
*NL*
come
home
jolly
,
there
's
a
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
gave
her
sister
an
encouraging
pat
on
the
shoulder
as
they
parted
for
*NL*
the
day
,
each
going
a
different
way
,
each
hugging
her
little
warm
*NL*
turn-over
,
and
each
trying
to
be
cheerful
in
spite
of
wintry
weather
,
*NL*
hard
work
,
and
the
unsatisfied
desires
of
pleasure-loving
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
March
lost
his
property
in
trying
to
help
an
unfortunate
*NL*
friend
,
the
two
oldest
girls
begged
to
be
allowed
to
do
something
toward
*NL*
their
own
support
,
at
least
.
Believing
that
they
could
not
begin
too
*NL*
early
to
cultivate
energy
,
industry
,
and
independence
,
their
parents
*NL*
consented
,
and
both
fell
to
work
with
the
hearty
good-will
which
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
obstacles
,
is
sure
to
succeed
at
last
.
Margaret
found
a
*NL*
place
as
nursery
governess
,
and
felt
rich
with
her
small
salary
.
As
she
*NL*
said
,
she
_
was
_
``
fond
of
luxury
,
''
and
her
chief
trouble
was
poverty
.
She
*NL*
found
it
harder
to
bear
than
the
others
,
because
she
could
remember
a
*NL*
time
when
home
was
beautiful
,
life
full
of
ease
and
pleasure
,
and
want
*NL*
of
any
kind
unknown
.
She
tried
not
to
be
envious
or
discontented
,
but
it
*NL*
was
very
natural
that
the
young
girl
should
long
for
pretty
things
,
gay
*NL*
friends
,
accomplishments
,
and
a
happy
life
.
At
the
Kings
'
she
daily
saw
*NL*
all
she
wanted
,
for
the
children
's
older
sisters
were
just
out
,
and
Meg
*NL*
caught
frequent
glimpses
of
dainty
ball-dresses
and
bouquets
,
heard
*NL*
lively
gossip
about
theatres
,
concerts
,
sleighing
parties
,
and
*NL*
merry-makings
of
all
kinds
,
and
saw
money
lavished
on
trifles
which
*NL*
would
have
been
so
precious
to
her
.
Poor
Meg
seldom
complained
,
but
a
*NL*
sense
of
injustice
made
her
feel
bitter
toward
every
one
sometimes
,
for
*NL*
she
had
not
yet
learned
to
know
how
rich
she
was
in
the
blessings
which
*NL*
alone
can
make
life
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
happened
to
suit
Aunt
March
,
who
was
lame
,
and
needed
an
active
*NL*
person
to
wait
upon
her
.
The
childless
old
lady
had
offered
to
adopt
one
*NL*
of
the
girls
when
the
troubles
came
,
and
was
much
offended
because
her
*NL*
offer
was
declined
.
Other
friends
told
the
Marches
that
they
had
lost
*NL*
all
chance
of
being
remembered
in
the
rich
old
lady
's
will
;
but
the
*NL*
unworldly
Marches
only
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't
give
up
our
girls
for
a
dozen
fortunes
.
Rich
or
poor
,
we
will
*NL*
keep
together
and
be
happy
in
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
would
n't
speak
to
them
for
a
time
,
but
happening
to
meet
Jo
*NL*
at
a
friend
's
,
something
in
her
comical
face
and
blunt
manners
struck
*NL*
the
old
lady
's
fancy
,
and
she
proposed
to
take
her
for
a
companion
.
This
*NL*
did
not
suit
Jo
at
all
;
but
she
accepted
the
place
since
nothing
better
*NL*
appeared
,
and
,
to
every
one
's
surprise
,
got
on
remarkably
well
with
her
*NL*
irascible
relative
.
There
was
an
occasional
tempest
,
and
once
Jo
had
*NL*
marched
home
,
declaring
she
could
n't
bear
it
any
longer
;
but
Aunt
March
*NL*
always
cleared
up
quickly
,
and
sent
for
her
back
again
with
such
urgency
*NL*
that
she
could
not
refuse
,
for
in
her
heart
she
rather
liked
the
peppery
*NL*
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
suspect
that
the
real
attraction
was
a
large
library
of
fine
books
,
*NL*
which
was
left
to
dust
and
spiders
since
Uncle
March
died
.
Jo
remembered
*NL*
the
kind
old
gentleman
,
who
used
to
let
her
build
railroads
and
bridges
*NL*
with
his
big
dictionaries
,
tell
her
stories
about
the
queer
pictures
in
*NL*
his
Latin
books
,
and
buy
her
cards
of
gingerbread
whenever
he
met
her
in
*NL*
the
street
.
The
dim
,
dusty
room
,
with
the
busts
staring
down
from
the
*NL*
tall
book-cases
,
the
cosy
chairs
,
the
globes
,
and
,
best
of
all
,
the
*NL*
wilderness
of
books
,
in
which
she
could
wander
where
she
liked
,
made
the
*NL*
library
a
region
of
bliss
to
her
.
The
moment
Aunt
March
took
her
nap
,
or
*NL*
was
busy
with
company
,
Jo
hurried
to
this
quiet
place
,
and
,
curling
*NL*
herself
up
in
the
easy-chair
,
devoured
poetry
,
romance
,
history
,
*NL*
travels
,
and
pictures
,
like
a
regular
book-worm
.
But
,
like
all
*NL*
happiness
,
it
did
not
last
long
;
for
as
sure
as
she
had
just
reached
the
*NL*
heart
of
the
story
,
the
sweetest
verse
of
the
song
,
or
the
most
perilous
*NL*
adventure
of
her
traveller
,
a
shrill
voice
called
,
``
Josy-phine
!
*NL*
Josy-phine
!
''
and
she
had
to
leave
her
paradise
to
wind
yarn
,
wash
the
*NL*
poodle
,
or
read
Belsham
's
Essays
by
the
hour
together

*NL*
Jo
's
ambition
was
to
do
something
very
splendid
;
what
it
was
she
had
no
*NL*
idea
,
as
yet
,
but
left
it
for
time
to
tell
her
;
and
,
meanwhile
,
found
*NL*
her
greatest
affliction
in
the
fact
that
she
could
n't
read
,
run
,
and
*NL*
ride
as
much
as
she
liked
.
A
quick
temper
,
sharp
tongue
,
and
restless
*NL*
spirit
were
always
getting
her
into
scrapes
,
and
her
life
was
a
series
*NL*
of
ups
and
downs
,
which
were
both
comic
and
pathetic
.
But
the
training
*NL*
she
received
at
Aunt
March
's
was
just
what
she
needed
;
and
the
thought
*NL*
that
she
was
doing
something
to
support
herself
made
her
happy
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
the
perpetual
``
Josy-phine

''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
was
too
bashful
to
go
to
school
;
it
had
been
tried
,
but
she
*NL*
suffered
so
much
that
it
was
given
up
,
and
she
did
her
lessons
at
home
,
*NL*
with
her
father
.
Even
when
he
went
away
,
and
her
mother
was
called
to
*NL*
devote
her
skill
and
energy
to
Soldiers
'
Aid
Societies
,
Beth
went
*NL*
faithfully
on
by
herself
,
and
did
the
best
she
could
.
She
was
a
*NL*
housewifely
little
creature
,
and
helped
Hannah
keep
home
neat
and
*NL*
comfortable
for
the
workers
,
never
thinking
of
any
reward
but
to
be
*NL*
loved
.
Long
,
quiet
days
she
spent
,
not
lonely
nor
idle
,
for
her
little
*NL*
world
was
peopled
with
imaginary
friends
,
and
she
was
by
nature
a
busy
*NL*
bee
.
There
were
six
dolls
to
be
taken
up
and
dressed
every
morning
,
for
*NL*
Beth
was
a
child
still
,
and
loved
her
pets
as
well
as
ever
.
Not
one
*NL*
whole
or
handsome
one
among
them
;
all
were
outcasts
till
Beth
took
them
*NL*
in
;
for
,
when
her
sisters
outgrew
these
idols
,
they
passed
to
her
,
*NL*
because
Amy
would
have
nothing
old
or
ugly
.
Beth
cherished
them
all
the
*NL*
more
tenderly
for
that
very
reason
,
and
set
up
a
hospital
for
infirm
*NL*
dolls
.
No
pins
were
ever
stuck
into
their
cotton
vitals
;
no
harsh
words
*NL*
or
blows
were
ever
given
them
;
no
neglect
ever
saddened
the
heart
of
the
*NL*
most
repulsive
:
but
all
were
fed
and
clothed
,
nursed
and
caressed
,
with
*NL*
an
affection
which
never
failed
.
One
forlorn
fragment
of
_
dollanity
_
had
*NL*
belonged
to
Jo
;
and
,
having
led
a
tempestuous
life
,
was
left
a
wreck
in
*NL*
the
rag-bag
,
from
which
dreary
poorhouse
it
was
rescued
by
Beth
,
and
*NL*
taken
to
her
refuge
.
Having
no
top
to
its
head
,
she
tied
on
a
neat
*NL*
little
cap
,
and
,
as
both
arms
and
legs
were
gone
,
she
hid
these
*NL*
deficiencies
by
folding
it
in
a
blanket
,
and
devoting
her
best
bed
to
*NL*
this
chronic
invalid
.
If
any
one
had
known
the
care
lavished
on
that
*NL*
dolly
,
I
think
it
would
have
touched
their
hearts
,
even
while
they
*NL*
laughed
.
She
brought
it
bits
of
bouquets
;
she
read
to
it
,
took
it
out
to
*NL*
breathe
the
air
,
hidden
under
her
coat
;
she
sung
it
lullabys
,
and
never
*NL*
went
to
bed
without
kissing
its
dirty
face
,
and
whispering
tenderly
,
``
I
*NL*
hope
you
'll
have
a
good
night
,
my
poor
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
had
her
troubles
as
well
as
the
others
;
and
not
being
an
angel
,
but
*NL*
a
very
human
little
girl
,
she
often
``
wept
a
little
weep
,
''
as
Jo
said
,
*NL*
because
she
could
n't
take
music
lessons
and
have
a
fine
piano
.
She
loved
*NL*
music
so
dearly
,
tried
so
hard
to
learn
,
and
practised
away
so
patiently
*NL*
at
the
jingling
old
instrument
,
that
it
did
seem
as
if
some
one
-LRB-
not
to
*NL*
hint
Aunt
March
-RRB-
ought
to
help
her
.
Nobody
did
,
however
,
and
nobody
saw
*NL*
Beth
wipe
the
tears
off
the
yellow
keys
,
that
would
n't
keep
in
tune
,
*NL*
when
she
was
all
alone
.
She
sang
like
a
little
lark
about
her
work
,
*NL*
never
was
too
tired
to
play
for
Marmee
and
the
girls
,
and
day
after
day
*NL*
said
hopefully
to
herself
,
``
I
know
I
'll
get
my
music
some
time
,
if
I
'm
*NL*
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
are
many
Beths
in
the
world
,
shy
and
quiet
,
sitting
in
corners
*NL*
till
needed
,
and
living
for
others
so
cheerfully
that
no
one
sees
the
*NL*
sacrifices
till
the
little
cricket
on
the
hearth
stops
chirping
,
and
the
*NL*
sweet
,
sunshiny
presence
vanishes
,
leaving
silence
and
shadow
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
anybody
had
asked
Amy
what
the
greatest
trial
of
her
life
was
,
she
*NL*
would
have
answered
at
once
,
``
My
nose
.
''
When
she
was
a
baby
,
Jo
had
*NL*
accidentally
dropped
her
into
the
coal-hod
,
and
Amy
insisted
that
the
*NL*
fall
had
ruined
her
nose
forever
.
It
was
not
big
,
nor
red
,
like
poor
*NL*
``
Petrea
's
''
;
it
was
only
rather
flat
,
and
all
the
pinching
in
the
world
*NL*
could
not
give
it
an
aristocratic
point
.
No
one
minded
it
but
herself
,
*NL*
and
it
was
doing
its
best
to
grow
,
but
Amy
felt
deeply
the
want
of
a
*NL*
Grecian
nose
,
and
drew
whole
sheets
of
handsome
ones
to
console
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Little
Raphael
,
''
as
her
sisters
called
her
,
had
a
decided
talent
for
*NL*
drawing
,
and
was
never
so
happy
as
when
copying
flowers
,
designing
*NL*
fairies
,
or
illustrating
stories
with
queer
specimens
of
art
.
Her
*NL*
teachers
complained
that
,
instead
of
doing
her
sums
,
she
covered
her
*NL*
slate
with
animals
;
the
blank
pages
of
her
atlas
were
used
to
copy
maps
*NL*
on
;
and
caricatures
of
the
most
ludicrous
description
came
fluttering
*NL*
out
of
all
her
books
at
unlucky
moments
.
She
got
through
her
lessons
as
*NL*
well
as
she
could
,
and
managed
to
escape
reprimands
by
being
a
model
of
*NL*
deportment
.
She
was
a
great
favorite
with
her
mates
,
being
*NL*
good-tempered
,
and
possessing
the
happy
art
of
pleasing
without
effort
.
*NL*
Her
little
airs
and
graces
were
much
admired
,
so
were
her
*NL*
accomplishments
;
for
beside
her
drawing
,
she
could
play
twelve
tunes
,
*NL*
crochet
,
and
read
French
without
mispronouncing
more
than
two
thirds
of
*NL*
the
words
.
She
had
a
plaintive
way
of
saying
,
``
When
papa
was
rich
we
did
*NL*
so-and-so
,
''
which
was
very
touching
;
and
her
long
words
were
considered
*NL*
``
perfectly
elegant
''
by
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
spoilt
;
for
every
one
petted
her
,
and
her
*NL*
small
vanities
and
selfishnesses
were
growing
nicely
.
One
thing
,
*NL*
however
,
rather
quenched
the
vanities
;
she
had
to
wear
her
cousin
's
*NL*
clothes
.
Now
Florence
's
mamma
had
n't
a
particle
of
taste
,
and
Amy
*NL*
suffered
deeply
at
having
to
wear
a
red
instead
of
a
blue
bonnet
,
*NL*
unbecoming
gowns
,
and
fussy
aprons
that
did
not
fit
.
Everything
was
*NL*
good
,
well
made
,
and
little
worn
;
but
Amy
's
artistic
eyes
were
much
*NL*
afflicted
,
especially
this
winter
,
when
her
school
dress
was
a
dull
*NL*
purple
,
with
yellow
dots
,
and
no
trimming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
only
comfort
,
''
she
said
to
Meg
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
``
is
,
that
*NL*
mother
do
n't
take
tucks
in
my
dresses
whenever
I
'm
naughty
,
as
Maria
*NL*
Parks
'
mother
does
.
My
dear
,
it
's
really
dreadful
;
for
sometimes
she
is
*NL*
so
bad
,
her
frock
is
up
to
her
knees
,
and
she
ca
n't
come
to
school
.
When
*NL*
I
think
of
this
_
deggerredation
_
,
I
feel
that
I
can
bear
even
my
flat
*NL*
nose
and
purple
gown
,
with
yellow
sky-rockets
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
was
Amy
's
confidant
and
monitor
,
and
,
by
some
strange
attraction
of
*NL*
opposites
,
Jo
was
gentle
Beth
's
.
To
Jo
alone
did
the
shy
child
tell
her
*NL*
thoughts
;
and
over
her
big
,
harum-scarum
sister
,
Beth
unconsciously
*NL*
exercised
more
influence
than
any
one
in
the
family
.
The
two
older
girls
*NL*
were
a
great
deal
to
one
another
,
but
each
took
one
of
the
younger
into
*NL*
her
keeping
,
and
watched
over
her
in
her
own
way
;
``
playing
mother
''
they
*NL*
called
it
,
and
put
their
sisters
in
the
places
of
discarded
dolls
,
with
*NL*
the
maternal
instinct
of
little
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
anybody
got
anything
to
tell
?
It
's
been
such
a
dismal
day
I
'm
*NL*
really
dying
for
some
amusement
,
''
said
Meg
,
as
they
sat
sewing
together
*NL*
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
queer
time
with
aunt
to-day
,
and
,
as
I
got
the
best
of
it
,
I
'll
*NL*
tell
you
about
it
,
''
began
Jo
,
who
dearly
loved
to
tell
stories
.
``
I
was
*NL*
reading
that
everlasting
Belsham
,
and
droning
away
as
I
always
do
,
for
*NL*
aunt
soon
drops
off
,
and
then
I
take
out
some
nice
book
,
and
read
like
*NL*
fury
till
she
wakes
up
.
I
actually
made
myself
sleepy
;
and
,
before
she
*NL*
began
to
nod
,
I
gave
such
a
gape
that
she
asked
me
what
I
meant
by
*NL*
opening
my
mouth
wide
enough
to
take
the
whole
book
in
at
once

I

said
I
,
trying
not
to
be
saucy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
gave
me
a
long
lecture
on
my
sins
,
and
told
me
to
sit
and
*NL*
think
them
over
while
she
just
`
lost
'
herself
for
a
moment
.
She
never
*NL*
finds
herself
very
soon
;
so
the
minute
her
cap
began
to
bob
,
like
a
*NL*
top-heavy
dahlia
,
I
whipped
the
`
Vicar
of
Wakefield
'
out
of
my
pocket
,
*NL*
and
read
away
,
with
one
eye
on
him

one
on
aunt

I
'd
just
got
to
*NL*
where
they
all
tumbled
into
the
water
,
when
I
forgot
,
and
laughed
out
*NL*
loud
.
Aunt
woke
up
;
and
,
being
more
good-natured
after
her
nap
,
told
me
*NL*
to
read
a
bit
,
and
show
what
frivolous
work
I
preferred
to
the
worthy
*NL*
and
instructive
Belsham

I
did
my
very
best

she
liked
it

she
only
said

*NL*
``
Back
I

Once

She
caught
up

I
did

ask
any

of

felt
so
sorry

was
rather
glad

Amy
,
shaking
her
head

as
if
her

had
been
a
deep
one

``
Susie
Perkins
came
to
school

to-day
with

red
carnelian
ring

I
wanted
it
dreadfully

and
*NL*
wished
I
was
her
with
all
my
might

Well
,
she
drew
a
picture
of
Mr.

with
a
monstrous
nose

When
I
went

get
some

Mr.

Laurence
was
in
the
fish-shop

he
did

for
I
kept
behind
a

barrel

he
was
busy
with
Mr.

the
fish-man

A
poor
woman
came

in

asked
Mr.

if
he
would

some
scrubbing

she
had

Mr.

`
No

hooked
up

held
it
out

She

she
took

When
they
had
laughed
at
Beth
's
story
,
they
asked
their
mother
for
one
;
*NL*
and
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
she
said
soberly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
sat
cutting
out
blue
flannel
jackets
to-day
,
at
the
rooms

I
felt
*NL*
very
anxious
about
father
,
and
thought
how
lonely
and
helpless
we
should
*NL*
be
,
if
anything
happened
to
him
.
It
was
not
a
wise
thing
to
do
;

I
*NL*
kept
on
worrying
,
till
an
old
man
came
in
,
with
an
order
for
some
*NL*
clothes
.
He
sat
down
near
me
,
and
I
began
to
talk
to
him
;
for
he
looked
*NL*
poor
and
tired
and
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Have
you
sons
in

I
asked
;
for
the
note
he
brought
was
not
*NL*
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes

ma'am

I
had
four
,
but
two
were
killed

one

*NL*
I
'm
going
to
the
other
,
who
is
very
sick
in

Washington

he
*NL*
answered
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
You
have
done
a
great
deal

I
said
,
feeling

respect
now
,
instead
of
pity

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Not

more
than
I
ought

I
'd
go
myself

*NL*
``
He
spoke
so
cheerfully

looked
so
sincere

and
seemed
so
glad
to
give
*NL*
his
all
,
that
I
was
ashamed
of
myself

I
'd
given
one
man
,
and
thought
it
*NL*
too
much

while
he
gave
four
,
without
grudging
them

I
had
all
my

*NL*
to
comfort
me
at

his
last
son
was
waiting

miles
away

to
say
*NL*
`
good
by

to
him
,
perhaps
!
I
felt
so
rich

so
happy

thinking
of
my

blessings

I
made
him
a
nice

after
a
minute

silence

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
smiled
,
and
began
at
once
;
for
she
had
told
stories
to
this
*NL*
little
audience
for
many
years
,
and
knew
how
to
please
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
upon
a
time
,
there
were
four
girls

who
had
enough
to
eat

*NL*
drink
and
wear

a
good
many
comforts

pleasures

kind
friends

*NL*
parents

who
loved
them
dearly
,
and
yet
they
were
not
contented
.
''
-LRB-
Here
*NL*
the
listeners
stole
sly
looks
at
one
another
,
and
began
to
sew
*NL*
diligently
.
-RRB-
``
These
girls
were
anxious
to
be
good
,
and
made
many
*NL*
excellent
resolutions
;
but
they
did
not
keep
them
very
well
,
and
were
*NL*
constantly
saying
,
`
If
we
only
had
this
,
'
or
`
If
we
could
only
do
that

*NL*
quite
forgetting
how
much
they
already
had
,
and
how
many
pleasant
things
*NL*
they
actually
could
do
.
So
they
asked
an
old
woman
what
spell
they
could
*NL*
use
to
make
them
happy
,
and
she
said
,
`
When
you
feel
discontented

think
*NL*
over
your
blessings
,
and
be
grateful

-LRB-
Here
Jo
looked
up
quickly
,
as
*NL*
if
about
to
speak
,
but
changed
her
mind
,
seeing
that
the
story
was
not
*NL*
done
yet
.
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Being
sensible
girls
,
they
decided
to
try
her
advice
,
and
soon
were
*NL*
surprised
to
see
how
well
off
they
were
.
One
discovered
that
money
*NL*
could
n't
keep
shame
and
sorrow
out
of
rich
people
's
houses
;
another
*NL*
that
,
though
she
was
poor
,
she
was
a
great
deal
happier
,
with
her
youth
,
*NL*
health
,
and
good
spirits
,
than
a
certain
fretful
,
feeble
old
lady
,
who
*NL*
could
n't
enjoy
her
comforts
;
a
third
that
,
disagreeable
as
it
was
to
*NL*
help
get
dinner
,
it
was
harder
still
to
have
to
go
begging
for
it
;
and
*NL*
the
fourth
,
that
even
carnelian
rings
were
not
so
valuable
as
good
*NL*
behavior
.
So
they
agreed
to
stop
complaining
,
to
enjoy
the
blessings
*NL*
already
possessed
,
and
try
to
deserve
them
,
lest
they
should
be
taken
*NL*
away
entirely
,
instead
of
increased
;
and
I
believe
they
were
never
*NL*
disappointed
,
or
sorry
that
they
took
the
old
woman
's
advice
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

that
is
very
cunning
of
you
to
turn
our

give
us
a
sermon
instead
of
a
romance
!

cried
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
kind
of
sermon

It
's
the

said

Beth
thoughtfully
,
putting
the
needles
straight
on
Jo
's
cushion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

complain

careful
than

Amy
morally

*NL*
*NL*
``

Jo

who
could
not
,
for
the
life
of
her
,
*NL*
help
getting
a
morsel
of
fun
out
of
the
little
sermon

took

it

What

''
asked
Meg
,
one
snowy
*NL*
afternoon
,
as
her
sister
came
tramping
through
the
hall
,
in
rubber
*NL*
boots
,
old
sack
and
hood
,
with
a
broom
in
one
hand
and
a
shovel
in
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
out

answered
Jo
,
with
a
mischievous
twinkle
in
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
two
long
walks
this
morning
would
have
been
enough

It
's
*NL*
cold
and
dull
out
;
and
I
advise
you
to
stay
,
warm
and
dry
,
by
the
fire
,
*NL*
as
I
do

said
Meg
,
with
a
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
take
advice
!
Ca
n't
keep
still
all
day
,
and
,
not
being
a
pussycat
,
*NL*
I
do
n't
like
to
doze
by
the
fire
.
I
like
adventures
,
and
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
find
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
went
back
to
toast
her
feet
and
read
``
Ivanhoe
''
;
and
Jo
began
to
dig
*NL*
paths
with
great
energy
.
The
snow
was
light
,
and
with
her
broom
she
soon
*NL*
swept
a
path
all
round
the
garden
,
for
Beth
to
walk
in
when
the
sun
came
*NL*
out
;
and
the
invalid
dolls
needed
air
.
Now
,
the
garden
separated
the
*NL*
Marches
'
house
from
that
of
Mr.
Laurence
.
Both
stood
in
a
suburb
of
the
*NL*
city
,
which
was
still
country-like
,
with
groves
and
lawns
,
large
*NL*
gardens
,
and
quiet
streets
.
A
low
hedge
parted
the
two
estates
.
On
one
*NL*
side
was
an
old
,
brown
house
,
looking
rather
bare
and
shabby
,
robbed
of
*NL*
the
vines
that
in
summer
covered
its
walls
,
and
the
flowers
which
then
*NL*
surrounded
it
.
On
the
other
side
was
a
stately
stone
mansion
,
plainly
*NL*
betokening
every
sort
of
comfort
and
luxury
,
from
the
big
coach-house
*NL*
and
well-kept
grounds
to
the
conservatory
and
the
glimpses
of
lovely
*NL*
things
one
caught
between
the
rich
curtains
.
Yet
it
seemed
a
lonely
,
*NL*
lifeless
sort
of
house
;
for
no
children
frolicked
on
the
lawn
,
no
*NL*
motherly
face
ever
smiled
at
the
windows
,
and
few
people
went
in
and
*NL*
out
,
except
the
old
gentleman
and
his
grandson
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Jo
's
lively
fancy
,
this
fine
house
seemed
a
kind
of
enchanted
palace
,
*NL*
full
of
splendors
and
delights
,
which
no
one
enjoyed
.
She
had
long
*NL*
wanted
to
behold
these
hidden
glories
,
and
to
know
the
``
Laurence
boy
,
''
*NL*
who
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
be
known
,
if
he
only
knew
how
to
*NL*
begin
.
Since
the
party
,
she
had
been
more
eager
than
ever
,
and
had
*NL*
planned
many
ways
of
making
friends
with
him
;
but
he
had
not
been
seen
*NL*
lately
,
and
Jo
began
to
think
he
had
gone
away
,
when
she
one
day
spied
a
*NL*
brown
face
at
an
upper
window
,
looking
wistfully
down
into
their
garden
,
*NL*
where
Beth
and
Amy
were
snow-balling
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
boy
is
suffering
for
society
and
fun
,
''
she
said
to
herself
.
``
His
*NL*
grandpa
does
not
know
what
's
good
for
him
,
and
keeps
him
shut
up
all
*NL*
alone
.
He
needs
a
party
of
jolly
boys
to
play
with
,
or
somebody
young
*NL*
and
lively
.
I
've
a
great
mind
to
go
over
and
tell
the
old
gentleman
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
idea
amused
Jo
,
who
liked
to
do
daring
things
,
and
was
always
*NL*
scandalizing
Meg
by
her
queer
performances
.
The
plan
of
``
going
over
''
was
*NL*
not
forgotten
;
and
when
the
snowy
afternoon
came
,
Jo
resolved
to
try
*NL*
what
could
be
done
.
She
saw
Mr.
Laurence
drive
off
,
and
then
sallied
out
*NL*
to
dig
her
way
down
to
the
hedge
,
where
she
paused
,
and
took
a
survey
.
*NL*
All
quiet
,
--
curtains
down
at
the
lower
windows
;
servants
out
of
sight
,
*NL*
and
nothing
human
visible
but
a
curly
black
head
leaning
on
a
thin
hand
*NL*
at
the
upper
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
he
is
,
''
thought
Jo
,
``
poor
boy
!
all
alone
and
sick
this
dismal
*NL*
day
.
It
's
a
shame
!
I
'll
toss
up
a
snow-ball
,
and
make
him
look
out
,
and
*NL*
then
say
a
kind
word
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
went
a
handful
of
soft
snow
,
and
the
head
turned
at
once
,
showing
a
*NL*
face
which
lost
its
listless
look
in
a
minute
,
as
the
big
eyes
*NL*
brightened
and
the
mouth
began
to
smile
.
Jo
nodded
and
laughed
,
and
*NL*
flourished
her
broom
as
she
called
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
do
?
Are
you
sick
?

With

,
Jo
shouldered
her
broom
and
marched
into
the
house
,
wondering
*NL*
what
they
would
all
say
to
her
.
Laurie
was
in
a
flutter
of
excitement
at
*NL*
the
idea
of
having
company
,
and
flew
about
to
get
ready
;
for
,
as
Mrs.
*NL*
March
said
,
he
was
``
a
little
gentleman
,
''
and
did
honor
to
the
coming
*NL*
guest
by
brushing
his
curly
pate
,
putting
on
a
fresh
collar
,
and
trying
*NL*
to
tidy
up
the
room
,
which
,
in
spite
of
half
a
dozen
servants
,
was
*NL*
anything
but
neat
.
Presently
there
came
a
loud
ring
,
then
a
decided
*NL*
voice
,
asking
for
``
Mr.
Laurie
,
''
and
a
surprised-looking
servant
came
*NL*
running
up
to
announce

to
the
door
*NL*
of
his
little
parlor
to
meet
Jo
,
who
appeared
,
looking
rosy
and
kind
and
*NL*
quite
at
her
ease
,
with
a
covered
dish
in
one
hand
and
Beth
's
three
*NL*
kittens
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
bag
and
baggage
,
''
she
said
briskly
.
``
Mother
sent
her
love
,
*NL*
and
was
glad
if
I
could
do
anything
for
you
.
Meg
wanted
me
to
bring
some
*NL*
of
her
blanc-mange
;
she
makes
it
very
nicely
,
and
Beth
thought
her
cats
*NL*
would
be
comforting
.
I
knew
you
'd
laugh
at
them
,
but
I
could
n't
refuse
,
*NL*
she
was
so
anxious
to
do
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
so
happened
that
Beth
's
funny
loan
was
just
the
thing
;
for
,
in
*NL*
laughing
over
the
kits
,
Laurie
forgot
his
bashfulness
,
and
grew
sociable
*NL*
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
looks
too
pretty
to
eat
,
''
he
said
,
smiling
with
pleasure
,
as
Jo
*NL*
uncovered
the
dish
,
and
showed
the
blanc-mange
,
surrounded
by
a
garland
*NL*
of
green
leaves
,
and
the
scarlet
flowers
of
Amy
's
pet
geranium
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
anything
,
only
they
all
felt
kindly
,
and
wanted
to
show
it
.
*NL*
Tell
the
girl
to
put
it
away
for
your
tea
:
it
's
so
simple
,
you
can
eat
*NL*
it
;
and
,
being
soft
,
it
will
slip
down
without
hurting
your
sore
throat
.
*NL*
What
a
cosy
room
this
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
might
be
if
it
was
kept
nice
;
but
the
maids
are
lazy
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
make
them
mind
.
It
worries
me
,
though
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
right
it
up
in
two
minutes
;
for
it
only
needs
to
have
the
hearth
*NL*
brushed
,
so
,
--
and
the
things
made
straight
on
the
mantelpiece
so
,
--
and
*NL*
the
books
put
here
,
and
the
bottles
there
,
and
your
sofa
turned
from
the
*NL*
light
,
and
the
pillows
plumped
up
a
bit
.
Now
,
then
,
you
're
fixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
he
was
;
for
,
as
she
laughed
and
talked
,
Jo
had
whisked
things
*NL*
into
place
,
and
given
quite
a
different
air
to
the
room
.
Laurie
watched
*NL*
her
in
respectful
silence
;
and
when
she
beckoned
him
to
his
sofa
,
he
sat
*NL*
down
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
,
saying
gratefully
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
you
are
!
Yes
,
that
's
what
it
wanted
.
Now
please
take
the
big
*NL*
chair
,
and
let
me
do
something
to
amuse
my
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
came
to
amuse
you
.
Shall
I
read
aloud
?
''
and
Jo
looked
*NL*
affectionately
toward
some
inviting
books
near
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
I
've
read
all
those
,
and
if
you
do
n't
mind
,
I
'd
rather
*NL*
talk
,
''
answered
Laurie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
;
I
'll
talk
all
day
if
you
'll
only
set
me
going
.
Beth
says
I
*NL*
never
know
when
to
stop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Beth
the
rosy
one
,
who
stays
at
home
a
good
deal
,
and
sometimes
goes
*NL*
out
with
a
little
basket
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
with
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
Beth
;
she
's
my
girl
,
and
a
regular
good
one
she
is
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
pretty
one
is
Meg
,
and
the
curly-haired
one
is
Amy
,
I
believe
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
find
that
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
colored
up
,
but
answered
frankly
,
``
Why
,
you
see
,
I
often
hear
you
*NL*
calling
to
one
another
,
and
when
I
'm
alone
up
here
,
I
ca
n't
help
looking
*NL*
over
at
your
house
,
you
always
seem
to
be
having
such
good
times
.
I
beg
*NL*
your
pardon
for
being
so
rude
,
but
sometimes
you
forget
to
put
down
the
*NL*
curtain
at
the
window
where
the
flowers
are
;
and
when
the
lamps
are
*NL*
lighted
,
it
's
like
looking
at
a
picture
to
see
the
fire
,
and
you
all
*NL*
round
the
table
with
your
mother
;
her
face
is
right
opposite
,
and
it
*NL*
looks
so
sweet
behind
the
flowers
,
I
ca
n't
help
watching
it
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
got
any
mother
,
you
know
;
''
and
Laurie
poked
the
fire
to
hide
a
little
*NL*
twitching
of
the
lips
that
he
could
not
control
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solitary
,
hungry
look
in
his
eyes
went
straight
to
Jo
's
warm
heart
.
*NL*
She
had
been
so
simply
taught
that
there
was
no
nonsense
in
her
head
,
*NL*
and
at
fifteen
she
was
as
innocent
and
frank
as
any
child
.
Laurie
was
*NL*
sick
and
lonely
;
and
,
feeling
how
rich
she
was
in
home-love
and
*NL*
happiness
,
she
gladly
tried
to
share
it
with
him
.
Her
face
was
very
*NL*
friendly
and
her
sharp
voice
unusually
gentle
as
she
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
never
draw
that
curtain
any
more
,
and
I
give
you
leave
to
look
as
*NL*
much
as
you
like
.
I
just
wish
,
though
,
instead
of
peeping
,
you
'd
come
*NL*
over
and
see
us
.
Mother
is
so
splendid
,
she
'd
do
you
heaps
of
good
,
and
*NL*
Beth
would
sing
to
you
if
_
I
_
begged
her
to
,
and
Amy
would
dance
;
Meg
*NL*
and
I
would
make
you
laugh
over
our
funny
stage
properties
,
and
we
'd
*NL*
have
jolly
times
.
Would
n't
your
grandpa
let
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
would
,
if
your
mother
asked
him
.
He
's
very
kind
,
though
he
*NL*
does
not
look
so
;
and
he
lets
me
do
what
I
like
,
pretty
much
,
only
he
's
*NL*
afraid
I
might
be
a
bother
to
strangers
,
''
began
Laurie
,
brightening
more
*NL*
and
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
not
strangers
,
we
are
neighbors
,
and
you
need
n't
think
you
'd
be
*NL*
a
bother
.
We
_
want
_
to
know
you
,
and
I
've
been
trying
to
do
it
this
ever
*NL*
so
long
.
We
have
n't
been
here
a
great
while
,
you
know
,
but
we
have
got
*NL*
acquainted
with
all
our
neighbors
but
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
grandpa
lives
among
his
books
,
and
does
n't
mind
much
what
*NL*
happens
outside
.
Mr.
Brooke
,
my
tutor
,
does
n't
stay
here
,
you
know
,
and
*NL*
I
have
no
one
to
go
about
with
me
,
so
I
just
stop
at
home
and
get
on
as
*NL*
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
bad
.
You
ought
to
make
an
effort
,
and
go
visiting
everywhere
you
*NL*
are
asked
;
then
you
'll
have
plenty
of
friends
,
and
pleasant
places
to
go
*NL*
to
.
Never
mind
being
bashful
;
it
wo
n't
last
long
if
you
keep
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
turned
red
again
,
but
was
n't
offended
at
being
accused
of
*NL*
bashfulness
;
for
there
was
so
much
good-will
in
Jo
,
it
was
impossible
*NL*
not
to
take
her
blunt
speeches
as
kindly
as
they
were
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
your
school
?
''
asked
the
boy
,
changing
the
subject
,
after
a
*NL*
little
pause
,
during
which
he
stared
at
the
fire
,
and
Jo
looked
about
*NL*
her
,
well
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
to
school
;
I
'm
a
business
man
--
girl
,
I
mean
.
I
go
to
wait
on
*NL*
my
great-aunt
,
and
a
dear
,
cross
old
soul
she
is
,
too
,
''
answered
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
opened
his
mouth
to
ask
another
question
;
but
remembering
just
in
*NL*
time
that
it
was
n't
manners
to
make
too
many
inquiries
into
people
's
*NL*
affairs
,
he
shut
it
again
,
and
looked
uncomfortable
.
Jo
liked
his
good
*NL*
breeding
,
and
did
n't
mind
having
a
laugh
at
Aunt
March
,
so
she
gave
him
*NL*
a
lively
description
of
the
fidgety
old
lady
,
her
fat
poodle
,
the
parrot
*NL*
that
talked
Spanish
,
and
the
library
where
she
revelled
.
Laurie
enjoyed
*NL*
that
immensely
;
and
when
she
told
about
the
prim
old
gentleman
who
came
*NL*
once
to
woo
Aunt
March
,
and
,
in
the
middle
of
a
fine
speech
,
how
Poll
*NL*
had
tweaked
his
wig
off
to
his
great
dismay
,
the
boy
lay
back
and
*NL*
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
,
and
a
maid
popped
her
head
*NL*
in
to
see
what
was
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration

Poll
tweaked
off
his
wig
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
does
me
no
end
of
good
.
Tell
on
,
please
,
''
he
said
,
taking
his
*NL*
face
out
of
the
sofa-cushion
,
red
and
shining
with
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
elated
with
her
success
,
Jo
did
``
tell
on
,
''
all
about
their
plays
*NL*
and
plans
,
their
hopes
and
fears
for
father
,
and
the
most
interesting
*NL*
events
of
the
little
world
in
which
the
sisters
lived
.
Then
they
got
to
*NL*
talking
about
books
;
and
to
Jo
's
delight
,
she
found
that
Laurie
loved
*NL*
them
as
well
as
she
did
,
and
had
read
even
more
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
like
them
so
much
,
come
down
and
see
ours
.
Grandpa
is
out
,
so
*NL*
you
need
n't
be
afraid
,
''
said
Laurie
,
getting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
afraid
of
anything
,
''
returned
Jo
,
with
a
toss
of
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
you
are
!
''
exclaimed
the
boy
,
looking
at
her
with
much
*NL*
admiration
,
though
he
privately
thought
she
would
have
good
reason
to
be
*NL*
a
trifle
afraid
of
the
old
gentleman
,
if
she
met
him
in
some
of
his
*NL*
moods
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
atmosphere
of
the
whole
house
being
summer-like
,
Laurie
led
the
way
*NL*
from
room
to
room
,
letting
Jo
stop
to
examine
whatever
struck
her
fancy
;
*NL*
and
so
at
last
they
came
to
the
library
,
where
she
clapped
her
hands
,
*NL*
and
pranced
,
as
she
always
did
when
especially
delighted
.
It
was
lined
*NL*
with
books
,
and
there
were
pictures
and
statues
,
and
distracting
little
*NL*
cabinets
full
of
coins
and
curiosities
,
and
sleepy-hollow
chairs
,
and
*NL*
queer
tables
,
and
bronzes
;
and
,
best
of
all
,
a
great
open
fireplace
,
*NL*
with
quaint
tiles
all
round
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
richness
!
''
sighed
Jo
,
sinking
into
the
depth
of
a
velvet
chair
,
*NL*
and
gazing
about
her
with
an
air
of
intense
satisfaction
.
``
Theodore
*NL*
Laurence
,
you
ought
to
be
the
happiest
boy
in
the
world
,
''
she
added
*NL*
impressively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
fellow
ca
n't
live
on
books
,
''
said
Laurie
,
shaking
his
head
,
as
he
*NL*
perched
on
a
table
opposite
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
could
say
more
,
a
bell
rung
,
and
Jo
flew
up
,
exclaiming
with
*NL*
alarm
,
``
Mercy
me
!
it
's
your
grandpa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
if
it
is
?
You
are
not
afraid
of
anything
,
you
know
,
''
*NL*
returned
the
boy
,
looking
wicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
am
a
little
bit
afraid
of
him
,
but
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
*NL*
be
.
Marmee
said
I
might
come
,
and
I
do
n't
think
you
're
any
the
worse
for
*NL*
it
,
''
said
Jo
,
composing
herself
,
though
she
kept
her
eyes
on
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
great
deal
better
for
it
,
and
ever
so
much
obliged
.
I
'm
only
*NL*
afraid
you
are
very
tired
talking
to
me
;
it
was
_
so
_
pleasant
,
I
*NL*
could
n't
bear
to
stop
,
''
said
Laurie
gratefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
doctor
to
see
you
,
sir
,
''
and
the
maid
beckoned
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
if
I
left
you
for
a
minute
?
I
suppose
I
must
see
him
,
''
*NL*
said
Laurie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mind
me
.
I
'm
as
happy
as
a
cricket
here
,
''
answered
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
went
away
,
and
his
guest
amused
herself
in
her
own
way
.
She
was
*NL*
standing
before
a
fine
portrait
of
the
old
gentleman
,
when
the
door
*NL*
opened
again
,
and
,
without
turning
,
she
said
decidedly
,
``
I
'm
sure
now
*NL*
that
I
should
n't
be
afraid
of
him
,
for
he
's
got
kind
eyes
,
though
his
*NL*
mouth
is
grim
,
and
he
looks
as
if
he
had
a
tremendous
will
of
his
own
.
*NL*
He
is
n't
as
handsome
as
_
my
_
grandfather
,
but
I
like
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
ma'am
,
''
said
a
gruff
voice
behind
her
;
and
there
,
to
her
*NL*
great
dismay
,
stood
old
Mr.
Laurence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jo
blushed
till
she
could
n't
blush
any
redder
,
and
her
heart
began
*NL*
to
beat
uncomfortably
fast
as
she
thought
what
she
had
said
.
For
a
*NL*
minute
a
wild
desire
to
run
away
possessed
her
;
but
that
was
cowardly
,
*NL*
and
the
girls
would
laugh
at
her
:
so
she
resolved
to
stay
,
and
get
out
*NL*
of
the
scrape
as
she
could
.
A
second
look
showed
her
that
the
living
*NL*
eyes
,
under
the
bushy
gray
eyebrows
,
were
kinder
even
than
the
painted
*NL*
ones
;
and
there
was
a
sly
twinkle
in
them
,
which
lessened
her
fear
a
*NL*
good
deal
.
The
gruff
voice
was
gruffer
than
ever
,
as
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
said
abruptly
,
after
that
dreadful

you

*NL*
``
Not

And
you

*NL*

Yes

*NL*
That
answer
pleased
the
old
gentleman
;
he
gave
a
short
laugh
,
shook
*NL*
hands
with
her
,
and
,
putting
his
finger
under
her
chin
,
turned
up
her
*NL*
face
,
examined
it
gravely
,
and
let
it
go

saying

with
a
nod
,
``

what
is

*NL*
``
Thank
you

and
Jo
was
quite
comfortable
after
that
,
for
it
suited
*NL*
her
exactly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
doing
to
this
boy
of
mine
,
hey
?
''
was
the
next
*NL*
question
,
sharply
put
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
trying
to
be
neighborly
,
sir

and
Jo
told
how
her
visit
came
*NL*
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
he
needs
cheering
up
a
bit

do
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
he
seems
a
little
lonely
,
and
young
folks
would
do
him
good
*NL*
perhaps
.
We
are
only
girls
,
but
we
should
be
glad
to
help
if
we
could
,
*NL*
for
we
do
n't
forget
the
splendid
Christmas
present
you
sent
us
,

said
Jo
*NL*
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
,
tut
,
tut
!
that
was
the
boy
's
affair
.
How
is
the
poor
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doing
nicely
,
sir
;
''
and
off
went
Jo
,
talking
very
fast
,
as
she
told
all
*NL*
about
the
Hummels
,
in
whom
her
mother
had
interested
richer
friends
than
*NL*
they
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
her
father
's
way
of
doing
good

I
shall
come
and
see
your
mother
*NL*
some
fine
day
.
Tell
her
so
.
There
's
the
tea-bell
;
we
have
it
early
,
on
*NL*
the
boy
's
account
.
Come
down
,
and
go
on
being
neighborly

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'd
like
to
have
me
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
n't
ask
you
,
if
I
did
n't
;
''
and
Mr.
Laurence
offered
her
his
arm
*NL*
with
old-fashioned
courtesy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
would
_
Meg
say
to
this
?
''
thought
Jo
,
as
she
was
marched
away
,
*NL*
while
her
eyes
danced
with
fun
as
she
imagined
herself
telling
the
story
*NL*
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
!
Why
,
what
the
dickens
has
come
to
the
fellow
?
''
said
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
as
Laurie
came
running
down
stairs
,
and
brought
up
with
a
*NL*
start
of
surprise
at
the
astonishing
sight
of
Jo
arm-in-arm
with
his
*NL*
redoubtable
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
you
'd
come
,
sir
,
''
he
began
,
as
Jo
gave
him
a
triumphant
*NL*
little
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
evident
,
by
the
way
you
racket
down
stairs
.
Come
to
your
tea
,
*NL*
sir
,
and
behave
like
a
gentleman
;
''
and
having
pulled
the
boy
's
hair
by
*NL*
way
of
a
caress
,
Mr.
Laurence
walked
on
,
while
Laurie
went
through
a
*NL*
series
of
comic
evolutions
behind
their
backs
,
which
nearly
produced
an
*NL*
explosion
of
laughter
from
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
did
not
say
much
as
he
drank
his
four
cups
of
tea
,
but
*NL*
he
watched
the
young
people
,
who
soon
chatted
away
like
old
friends
,
and
*NL*
the
change
in
his
grandson
did
not
escape
him
.
There
was
color
,
light
,
*NL*
and
life
in
the
boy
's
face
now
,
vivacity
in
his
manner
,
and
genuine
*NL*
merriment
in
his
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
right
;
the
lad
_
is
_
lonely
.
I
'll
see
what
these
little
girls
can
*NL*
do
for
him
,
''
thought
Mr.
Laurence
,
as
he
looked
and
listened
.
He
liked
*NL*
Jo
,
for
her
odd
,
blunt
ways
suited
him
;
and
she
seemed
to
understand
the
*NL*
boy
almost
as
well
as
if
she
had
been
one
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
Laurences
had
been
what
Jo
called
``
prim
and
poky
,
''
she
would
not
*NL*
have
got
on
at
all
,
for
such
people
always
made
her
shy
and
awkward
;
but
*NL*
finding
them
free
and
easy
,
she
was
so
herself
,
and
made
a
good
*NL*
impression
.
When
they
rose
she
proposed
to
go
,
but
Laurie
said
he
had
*NL*
something
more
to
show
her
,
and
took
her
away
to
the
conservatory
,
which
*NL*
had
been
lighted
for
her
benefit
.
It
seemed
quite
fairylike
to
Jo
,
as
*NL*
she
went
up
and
down
the
walks
,
enjoying
the
blooming
walls
on
either
*NL*
side
,
the
soft
light
,
the
damp
sweet
air
,
and
the
wonderful
vines
and
*NL*
trees
that
hung
above
her
,
--
while
her
new
friend
cut
the
finest
flowers
*NL*
till
his
hands
were
full
;
then
he
tied
them
up
,
saying
,
with
the
happy
*NL*
look
Jo
liked
to
see
,
``
Please
give
these
to
your
mother
,
and
tell
her
I
*NL*
like
the
medicine
she
sent
me
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

Please

*NL*
*NL*
They
found
Mr.
Laurence
standing
before
the
fire
in
the
great
*NL*
drawing-room
,
but
Jo
's
attention
was
entirely
absorbed
by
a
grand
piano
,
*NL*
which
stood
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
play
?
''
she
asked
,
turning
to
Laurie
with
a
respectful
*NL*
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sometimes
,
''
he
answered
modestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
now
.
I
want
to
hear
it
,
so
I
can
tell
Beth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
first
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
how
;
too
stupid
to
learn
,
but
I
love
music
dearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Laurie
played
,
and
Jo
listened
,
with
her
nose
luxuriously
buried
in
*NL*
heliotrope
and
tea-roses
.
Her
respect
and
regard
for
the
``
Laurence
boy
''
*NL*
increased
very
much
,
for
he
played
remarkably
well
,
and
did
n't
put
on
*NL*
any
airs
.
She
wished
Beth
could
hear
him
,
but
she
did
not
say
so
;
only
*NL*
praised
him
till
he
was
quite
abashed
,
and
his
grandfather
came
to
the
*NL*
rescue
.
``
That
will
do
,
that
will
do
,
young
lady
.
Too
many
sugar-plums
*NL*
are
not
good
for
him
.
His
music
is
n't
bad
,
but
I
hope
he
will
do
as
well
*NL*
in
more
important
things
.
Going
?
Well
,
I
'm
much
obliged
to
you
,
and
I
*NL*
hope
you
'll
come
again
.
My
respects
to
your
mother
.
Good-night
,
Doctor
*NL*
Jo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
hands
kindly
,
but
looked
as
if
something
did
not
please
him
.
*NL*
When
they
got
into
the
hall
,
Jo
asked
Laurie
if
she
had
said
anything
*NL*
amiss
.
He
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
was
me
;
he
does
n't
like
to
hear
me
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
some
day
.
John
is
going
home
with
you
,
as
I
ca
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
need
of
that
;
I
am
not
a
young
lady
,
and
it
's
only
a
step
.
Take
care
*NL*
of
yourself
,
wo
n't
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
you
will
come

I
hope

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

*NL*
*NL*
When
all
the
afternoon
's
adventures
had
been
told
,
the
family
felt
*NL*
inclined
to
go
visiting
in
a
body
,
for
each
found
something
very
*NL*
attractive
in
the
big
house
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.
Mrs.
March
*NL*
wanted
to
talk
of
her
father
with
the
old
man
who
had
not
forgotten
him
;
*NL*
Meg
longed
to
walk
in
the
conservatory
;
Beth
sighed
for
the
grand
piano
;
*NL*
and
Amy
was
eager
to
see
the
fine
pictures
and
statues
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
why
did
n't
Mr.
Laurence
like
to
have
Laurie
play
?
''
asked
Jo
,
*NL*
who
was
of
an
inquiring
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sure
,
but
I
think
it
was
because
his
son
,
Laurie
's
father
,
*NL*
married
an
Italian
lady
,
a
musician
,
which
displeased
the
old
man
,
who
*NL*
is
very
proud
.
The
lady
was
good
and
lovely
and
accomplished
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
like
her
,
and
never
saw
his
son
after
he
married
.
They
both
died
*NL*
when
Laurie
was
a
little
child
,
and
then
his
grandfather
took
him
home
.
*NL*
I
fancy
the
boy
,
who
was
born
in
Italy
,
is
not
very
strong
,
and
the
old
*NL*
man
is
afraid
of
losing
him
,
which
makes
him
so
careful
.
Laurie
comes
*NL*
naturally
by
his
love
of
music
,
for
he
is
like
his
mother
,
and
I
dare
*NL*
say
his
grandfather
fears
that
he
may
want
to
be
a
musician
;
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
his
skill
reminds
him
of
the
woman
he
did
not
like
,
and
so
he
*NL*
`
glowered
,
'
as
Jo
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
,
how
romantic
!
''
exclaimed
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
silly
!
''
said
Jo
.
``
Let
him
be
a
musician
,
if
he
wants
to
,
and
not
*NL*
plague
his
life
out
sending
him
to
college
,
when
he
hates
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
he
has
such
handsome
black
eyes
and
pretty
manners
,
I
*NL*
suppose
.
Italians
are
always
nice

said
Meg
,
who
was
a
little
*NL*
sentimental
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
know
about
his
eyes
and
his
manners

You
never
spoke
to
*NL*
him

hardly

cried
Jo
,
who
was
_
not
_
sentimental
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
him
at
the
party
,
and
what
you
tell
shows
that
he
knows
how
to
*NL*
behave
.
That
was
a
nice
little
speech
about
the
medicine
mother
sent
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
meant
the
blanc-mange
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
stupid
you
are
,
child
!
He
meant
you
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
he
?
''
and
Jo
opened
her
eyes
as
if
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
such
a
girl
!
You
do
n't
know
a
compliment
when
you
get
it
,
''
*NL*
said
Meg
,
with
the
air
of
a
young
lady
who
knew
all
about
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
they
are
great
nonsense
,
and
I
'll
thank
you
not
to
be
silly
,
*NL*
and
spoil
my
fun
.
Laurie
's
a
nice
boy
,
and
I
like
him
,
and
I
wo
n't
have
*NL*
any
sentimental
stuff
about
compliments
and
such
rubbish
.
We
'll
all
be
*NL*
good
to
him
,
because
he
has
n't
got
any
mother
,
and
he
_
may
_
come
over
*NL*
and
see
us
,
may
n't
he

Marmee

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Jo
,
your
little
friend
is
very
welcome

and
I
hope
Meg
will
*NL*
remember
that
children

be
children
as
long
as
they
can

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
call
myself

Amy

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

answered
Beth
,
who
had
*NL*
not
heard
a
word
.
``
How
we
got
out

through

Wicket

up
the

that

*NL*
``
We

rather

liked
the
prospect

BETH
FINDS
THE
PALACE
BEAUTIFUL
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
big
house
did
prove
a
Palace
Beautiful
,
though
it
took
some
time
for
*NL*
all
to
get
in
,
and
Beth
found
it
very
hard
to
pass
the
lions
.
Old
Mr.
*NL*
Laurence
was
the
biggest
one
;
but
after
he
had
called
,
said
something
*NL*
funny
or
kind
to
each
one
of
the
girls
,
and
talked
over
old
times
with
*NL*
their
mother
,
nobody
felt
much
afraid
of
him
,
except
timid
Beth
.
The
*NL*
other
lion
was
the
fact
that
they
were
poor
and
Laurie
rich
;
for
this
*NL*
made
them
shy
of
accepting
favors
which
they
could
not
return
.
But
,
*NL*
after
a
while
,
they
found
that
he
considered
them
the
benefactors
,
and
*NL*
could
not
do
enough
to
show
how
grateful
he
was
for
Mrs.
March
's
*NL*
motherly
welcome
,
their
cheerful
society
,
and
the
comfort
he
took
in
*NL*
that
humble
home
of
theirs
.
So
they
soon
forgot
their
pride
,
and
*NL*
interchanged
kindnesses
without
stopping
to
think
which
was
the
greater
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
sorts
of
pleasant
things
happened
about
that
time
;
for
the
new
*NL*
friendship
flourished
like
grass
in
spring
.
Every
one
liked
Laurie
,
and
*NL*
he
privately
informed
his
tutor
that
``
the
Marches
were
regularly
*NL*
splendid
girls
.
''
With
the
delightful
enthusiasm
of
youth
,
they
took
the
*NL*
solitary
boy
into
their
midst
,
and
made
much
of
him
,
and
he
found
*NL*
something
very
charming
in
the
innocent
companionship
of
these
*NL*
simple-hearted
girls
.
Never
having
known
mother
or
sisters
,
he
was
quick
*NL*
to
feel
the
influences
they
brought
about
him
;
and
their
busy
,
lively
*NL*
ways
made
him
ashamed
of
the
indolent
life
he
led
.
He
was
tired
of
*NL*
books
,
and
found
people
so
interesting
now
that
Mr.
Brooke
was
obliged
*NL*
to
make
very
unsatisfactory
reports
;
for
Laurie
was
always
playing
*NL*
truant
,
and
running
over
to
the
Marches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
;
let
him
take
a
holiday
,
and
make
it
up
afterwards
,
''
said
*NL*
the
old
gentleman
.
``
The
good
lady
next
door
says
he
is
studying
too
*NL*
hard
,
and
needs
young
society
,
amusement
,
and
exercise
.
I
suspect
she
is
*NL*
right
,
and
that
I
've
been
coddling
the
fellow
as
if
I
'd
been
his
*NL*
grandmother
.
Let
him
do
what
he
likes
,
as
long
as
he
is
happy
.
He
ca
n't
*NL*
get
into
mischief
in
that
little
nunnery
over
there
;
and
Mrs.
March
is
*NL*
doing
more
for
him
than
we
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
good
times
they
had
,
to
be
sure
!
Such
plays
and
tableaux
,
such
*NL*
sleigh-rides
and
skating
frolics
,
such
pleasant
evenings
in
the
old
*NL*
parlor
,
and
now
and
then
such
gay
little
parties
at
the
great
house
.
Meg
*NL*
could
walk
in
the
conservatory
whenever
she
liked
,
and
revel
in
*NL*
bouquets
;
Jo
browsed
over
the
new
library
voraciously
,
and
convulsed
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
with
her
criticisms
;
Amy
copied
pictures
,
and
enjoyed
*NL*
beauty
to
her
heart
's
content
;
and
Laurie
played
``
lord
of
the
manor
''
in
*NL*
the
most
delightful
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Beth
,
though
yearning
for
the
grand
piano
,
could
not
pluck
up
*NL*
courage
to
go
to
the
``
Mansion
of
Bliss
,
''
as
Meg
called
it
.
She
went
once
*NL*
with
Jo
;
but
the
old
gentleman
,
not
being
aware
of
her
infirmity
,
stared
*NL*
at
her
so
hard
from
under
his
heavy
eyebrows
,
and
said
``
Hey
!
''
so
loud
,
*NL*
that
he
frightened
her
so
much
her
``
feet
chattered
on
the
floor
,
''
she
*NL*
told
her
mother
;
and
she
ran
away
,
declaring
she
would
never
go
there
*NL*
any
more
,
not
even
for
the
dear
piano
.
No
persuasions
or
enticements
*NL*
could
overcome
her
fear
,
till
,
the
fact
coming
to
Mr.
Laurence
's
ear
in
*NL*
some
mysterious
way
,
he
set
about
mending
matters
.
During
one
of
the
*NL*
brief
calls
he
made
,
he
artfully
led
the
conversation
to
music
,
and
*NL*
talked
away
about
great
singers
whom
he
had
seen
,
fine
organs
he
had
*NL*
heard
,
and
told
such
charming
anecdotes
that
Beth
found
it
impossible
to
*NL*
stay
in
her
distant
corner
,
but
crept
nearer
and
nearer
,
as
if
*NL*
fascinated
.
At
the
back
of
his
chair
she
stopped
,
and
stood
listening
,
*NL*
with
her
great
eyes
wide
open
,
and
her
cheeks
red
with
the
excitement
of
*NL*
this
unusual
performance
.
Taking
no
more
notice
of
her
than
if
she
had
*NL*
been
a
fly
,
Mr.
Laurence
talked
on
about
Laurie
's
lessons
and
teachers
;
*NL*
and
presently
,
as
if
the
idea
had
just
occurred
to
him
,
he
said
to
Mrs.
*NL*
March
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
boy
neglects
his
music
now
,
and
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
for
he
was
getting
*NL*
too
fond
of
it
.
But
the
piano
suffers
for
want
of
use
.
Would
n't
some
of
*NL*
your
girls
like
to
run
over
,
and
practise
on
it
now
and
then
,
just
to
*NL*
keep
it
in
tune
,
you
know
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
took
a
step
forward
,
and
pressed
her
hands
tightly
together
to
keep
*NL*
from
clapping
them
,
for
this
was
an
irresistible
temptation
;
and
the
*NL*
thought
of
practising
on
that
splendid
instrument
quite
took
her
breath
*NL*
away
.
Before
Mrs.
March
could
reply
,
Mr.
Laurence
went
on
with
an
odd
*NL*
little
nod
and
smile
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
need
n't
see
or
speak
to
any
one
,
but
run
in
at
any
time
;
for
I
'm
*NL*
shut
up
in
my
study
at
the
other
end
of
the
house
,
Laurie
is
out
a
great
*NL*
deal
,
and
the
servants
are
never
near
the
drawing-room
after
nine
*NL*
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
he
rose
,
as
if
going
,
and
Beth
made
up
her
mind
to
speak
,
for
that
*NL*
last
arrangement
left
nothing
to
be
desired
.
``
Please
tell
the
young
*NL*
ladies
what
I
say
;
and
if
they
do
n't
care
to
come
,
why
,
never
mind
.
''
*NL*
Here
a
little
hand
slipped
into
his
,
and
Beth
looked
up
at
him
with
a
*NL*
face
full
of
gratitude
,
as
she
said
,
in
her
earnest
yet
timid
way
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
sir
,
they
do
care
,
very
,
very
much
!

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are

the
musical

''
he
asked
,
without
any
startling
``
Hey

''
as
he
*NL*
looked
down
at
her
very
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

I
love
it

and
I
'll
come
,
if
you
are
quite
sure
nobody
*NL*
will
hear
me
--
and
be
disturbed
,
''
she
added
,
fearing
to
be
rude
,
and
*NL*
trembling
at
her
own
boldness
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
soul
,
my
dear
.
The
house
is
empty
half
the
day
;
so
come
,
and
drum
*NL*
away
as
much
as
you
like
,
and
I
shall
be
obliged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
you
are
,
sir
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
blushed
like
a
rose
under
the
friendly
look
he
wore
;
but
she
was
*NL*
not
frightened
now
,
and
gave
the
big
hand
a
grateful
squeeze
,
because
*NL*
she
had
no
words
to
thank
him
for
the
precious
gift
he
had
given
her
.
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
softly
stroked
the
hair
off
her
forehead
,
and
,
*NL*
stooping
down
,
he
kissed
her
,
saying
,
in
a
tone
few
people
ever
heard
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
little
girl
once
,
with
eyes
like
these
.
God
bless
you
,
my
dear
!
*NL*
Good
day
,
madam
;
''
and
away
he
went
,
in
a
great
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
had
a
rapture
with
her
mother
,
and
then
rushed
up
to
impart
the
*NL*
glorious
news
to
her
family
of
invalids
,
as
the
girls
were
not
at
home
.
*NL*
How
blithely
she
sung
that
evening
,
and
how
they
all
laughed
at
her
,
*NL*
because
she
woke
Amy
in
the
night
by
playing
the
piano
on
her
face
in
*NL*
her
sleep
.
Next
day
,
having
seen
both
the
old
and
young
gentleman
out
of
*NL*
the
house
,
Beth
,
after
two
or
three
retreats
,
fairly
got
in
at
the
*NL*
side-door
,
and
made
her
way
,
as
noiselessly
as
any
mouse
,
to
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
where
her
idol
stood
.
Quite
by
accident
,
of
course
,
some
*NL*
pretty
,
easy
music
lay
on
the
piano
;
and
,
with
trembling
fingers
,
and
*NL*
frequent
stops
to
listen
and
look
about
,
Beth
at
last
touched
the
great
*NL*
instrument
,
and
straightway
forgot
her
fear
,
herself
,
and
everything
*NL*
else
but
the
unspeakable
delight
which
the
music
gave
her
,
for
it
was
*NL*
like
the
voice
of
a
beloved
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stayed
till
Hannah
came
to
take
her
home
to
dinner
;
but
she
had
no
*NL*
appetite
,
and
could
only
sit
and
smile
upon
every
one
in
a
general
state
*NL*
of
beatitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
that
,
the
little
brown
hood
slipped
through
the
hedge
nearly
every
*NL*
day
,
and
the
great
drawing-room
was
haunted
by
a
tuneful
spirit
that
*NL*
came
and
went
unseen
.
She
never
knew
that
Mr.
Laurence
often
opened
his
*NL*
study-door
to
hear
the
old-fashioned
airs
he
liked
;
she
never
saw
Laurie
*NL*
mount
guard
in
the
hall
to
warn
the
servants
away
;
she
never
suspected
*NL*
that
the
exercise-books
and
new
songs
which
she
found
in
the
rack
were
*NL*
put
there
for
her
especial
benefit
;
and
when
he
talked
to
her
about
*NL*
music
at
home
,
she
only
thought
how
kind
he
was
to
tell
things
that
*NL*
helped
her
so
much
.
So
she
enjoyed
herself
heartily
,
and
found
,
what
*NL*
is
n't
always
the
case
,
that
her
granted
wish
was
all
she
had
hoped
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
because
she
was
so
grateful
for
this
blessing
that
a
*NL*
greater
was
given
her
;
at
any
rate
,
she
deserved
both
.

Mr.

often
opened
his

door
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
I
'm
going
to
work
Mr.
Laurence
a
pair
of
slippers
.
He
is
so
*NL*
kind
to
me
,
I
must
thank
him
,
and
I
do
n't
know
any
other
way
.
Can
I
do
*NL*
it
?
''
asked
Beth
,
a
few
weeks
after
that
eventful
call
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
dear
.
It
will
please
him
very
much
,
and
be
a
nice
way
of
thanking
*NL*
him
.
The
girls
will
help
you
about
them
,
and
I
will
pay
for
the
making
*NL*
up
,
''
replied
Mrs.
March
,
who
took
peculiar
pleasure
in
granting
Beth
's
*NL*
requests
,
because
she
so
seldom
asked
anything
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
many
serious
discussions
with
Meg
and
Jo
,
the
pattern
was
chosen
,
*NL*
the
materials
bought
,
and
the
slippers
begun
.
A
cluster
of
grave
yet
*NL*
cheerful
pansies
,
on
a
deeper
purple
ground
,
was
pronounced
very
*NL*
appropriate
and
pretty
;
and
Beth
worked
away
early
and
late
,
with
*NL*
occasional
lifts
over
hard
parts
.
She
was
a
nimble
little
needle-woman
,
*NL*
and
they
were
finished
before
any
one
got
tired
of
them
.
Then
she
wrote
*NL*
a
very
short
,
simple
note
,
and
,
with
Laurie
's
help
,
got
them
smuggled
on
*NL*
to
the
study-table
one
morning
before
the
old
gentleman
was
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
excitement
was
over
,
Beth
waited
to
see
what
would
happen
.
All
*NL*
that
day
passed
,
and
a
part
of
the
next
,
before
any
acknowledgment
*NL*
arrived
,
and
she
was
beginning
to
fear
she
had
offended
her
crotchety
*NL*
friend
.
On
the
afternoon
of
the
second
day
,
she
went
out
to
do
an
*NL*
errand
,
and
give
poor
Joanna
,
the
invalid
doll
,
her
daily
exercise
.
As
*NL*
she
came
up
the
street
,
on
her
return
,
she
saw
three
,
yes
,
four
,
heads
*NL*
popping
in
and
out
of
the
parlor
windows
,
and
the
moment
they
saw
her
,
*NL*
several
hands
were
waved
,
and
several
joyful
voices
screamed
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
letter
from
the
old
gentleman
!
Come
quick
,
and
read
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Beth
,
he
's
sent
you
--
''
began
Amy
,
gesticulating
with
unseemly
energy
;
*NL*
but
she
got
no
further
,
for
Jo
quenched
her
by
slamming
down
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
hurried
on
in
a
flutter
of
suspense
.
At
the
door
,
her
sisters
*NL*
seized
and
bore
her
to
the
parlor
in
a
triumphal
procession
,
all
*NL*
pointing
,
and
all
saying
at
once
,
``
Look
there
!
look
there
!
''
Beth
did
*NL*
look
,
and
turned
pale
with
delight
and
surprise
;
for
there
stood
a
*NL*
little
cabinet-piano
,
with
a
letter
lying
on
the
glossy
lid
,
directed
,
*NL*
like
a
sign-board
,
to
``
Miss
Elizabeth
March
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
me
?
''
gasped
Beth
,
holding
on
to
Jo
,
and
feeling
as
if
she
should
*NL*
tumble
down
,
it
was
such
an
overwhelming
thing
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
all
for
you
,
my
precious
!
Is
n't
it
splendid
of
him
?
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
he
's
the
dearest
old
man
in
the
world
?
Here
's
the
key
in
the
*NL*
letter
.
We
did
n't
open
it
,
but
we
are
dying
to
know
what
he
says
,
''
cried
*NL*
Jo
,
hugging
her
sister
,
and
offering
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
read
it
!
I
ca
n't
,
I
feel
so
queer
!
Oh
,
it
is
too
lovely
!
''
and
Beth
*NL*
hid
her
face
in
Jo
's
apron
,
quite
upset
by
her
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
opened
the
paper
,
and
began
to
laugh
,
for
the
first
words
she
saw
*NL*
were
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

MARCH

_

Madam

,

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nice
it
sounds
!
I
wish
some
one
would
write
to
me
so
!
''
said
Amy
,
*NL*
who
thought
the
old-fashioned
address
very
elegant
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
I
have
had
many
pairs
of
slippers
in
my
life
,
but
I
never
had
*NL*
any
that
suited
me
so
well
as
yours

continued
Jo
.
*NL*
''
`
Heart
's

ease
is
my
favorite
flower
,
and
these
will
always
*NL*
remind
me

``
There
,
Beth
,
that
's
an
honor
to
be
proud
of
,
I
'm
sure
!
Laurie
told
me
*NL*
how
fond
Mr.
Laurence
used
to
be
of
the
child
who
died
,
and
how
he
kept
*NL*
all
her
little
things
carefully
.
Just
think
,
he
's
given
you
her
piano
.
*NL*
That
comes
of
having
big
blue
eyes
and
loving
music
,
''
said
Jo
,
trying
to
*NL*
soothe
Beth
,
who
trembled
,
and
looked
more
excited
than
she
had
ever
*NL*
been
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
the
cunning
brackets
to
hold
candles
,
and
the
nice
green
silk
,
*NL*
puckered
up
,
with
a
gold
rose
in
the
middle
,
and
the
pretty
rack
and
*NL*
stool
,
all
complete
,
''
added
Meg
,
opening
the
instrument
and
displaying
*NL*
its
beauties
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Your
humble
servant
,
James
Laurence
'
;
only
think
of
his
writing
that
*NL*
to
you
.
I
'll
tell
the
girls
.
They
'll
think
it
's
splendid
,
''
said
Amy
,
*NL*
much
impressed
by
the
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
it
,
honey
.
Let
's
hear
the
sound
of
the
baby-pianny
,
''
said
Hannah
,
*NL*
who
always
took
a
share
in
the
family
joys
and
sorrows
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Beth
tried
it
;
and
every
one
pronounced
it
the
most
remarkable
piano
*NL*
ever
heard
.
It
had
evidently
been
newly
tuned
and
put
in
apple-pie
*NL*
order
;
but
,
perfect
as
it
was
,
I
think
the
real
charm
of
it
lay
in
the
*NL*
happiest
of
all
happy
faces
which
leaned
over
it
,
as
Beth
lovingly
*NL*
touched
the
beautiful
black
and
white
keys
and
pressed
the
bright
*NL*
pedals
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
to
go
and
thank
him
,
''
said
Jo
,
by
way
of
a
joke
;
for
the
*NL*
idea
of
the
child
's
really
going
never
entered
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
mean
to
.
I
guess
I
'll
go
now
,
before
I
get
frightened
thinking
*NL*
about
it
.
''
And
,
to
the
utter
amazement
of
the
assembled
family
,
Beth
*NL*
walked
deliberately
down
the
garden
,
through
the
hedge
,
and
in
at
the
*NL*
Laurences
'
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wish
I
may
die
if
it
ai
n't
the
queerest
thing
I
ever
see
!
The
*NL*
pianny
has
turned
her
head
!
She
'd
never
have
gone
in
her
right
mind
,
''
*NL*
cried
Hannah
,
staring
after
her
,
while
the
girls
were
rendered
quite
*NL*
speechless
by
the
miracle
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
would
have
been
still
more
amazed
if
they
had
seen
what
Beth
did
*NL*
afterward
.
If
you
will
believe
me
,
she
went
and
knocked
at
the
*NL*
study-door
before
she
gave
herself
time
to
think
;
and
when
a
gruff
voice
*NL*
called
out
,
``
Come
in
!
''
she
did
go
in
,
right
up
to
Mr.
Laurence
,
who
*NL*
looked
quite
taken
aback
,
and
held
out
her
hand
,
saying
,
with
only
a
*NL*
small
quaver
in
her
voice
,
``
I
came
to
thank
you
,
sir
,
for
--
''
But
she
*NL*
did
n't
finish
;
for
he
looked
so
friendly
that
she
forgot
her
speech
,
*NL*
and
,
only
remembering
that
he
had
lost
the
little
girl
he
loved
,
she
put
*NL*
both
arms
round
his
neck
,
and
kissed
him
.

If
the
roof
of
the
house
had
suddenly
flown
off
,
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
would
n't
have
been
more
astonished
;
but
he
liked
it
,
--
oh
,
dear
,
yes
,
he
*NL*
liked
it
amazingly
!
--
and
was
so
touched
and
pleased
by
that
confiding
*NL*
little
kiss
that
all
his
crustiness
vanished
;
and
he
just
set
her
on
his
*NL*
knee
,
and
laid
his
wrinkled
cheek
against
her
rosy
one
,
feeling
as
if
he
*NL*
had
got
his
own
little
granddaughter
back
again
.
Beth
ceased
to
fear
him
*NL*
from
that
moment
,
and
sat
there
talking
to
him
as
cosily
as
if
she
had
*NL*
known
him
all
her
life
;
for
love
casts
out
fear
,
and
gratitude
can
*NL*
conquer
pride
.
When
she
went
home
,
he
walked
with
her
to
her
own
gate
,
*NL*
shook
hands
cordially
,
and
touched
his
hat
as
he
marched
back
again
,
*NL*
looking
very
stately
and
erect
,
like
a
handsome
,
soldierly
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
as
he
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
girls
saw
that
performance
,
Jo
began
to
dance
a
jig
,
by
way
of
*NL*
expressing
her
satisfaction
;
Amy
nearly
fell
out
of
the
window
in
her
*NL*
surprise
;
and
Meg
exclaimed
,
with
uplifted
hands
,
``
Well

the

is
coming
to
an
end

said
Amy
,
one
day
,
as
Laurie
*NL*
clattered
by
on
horseback
,
with
a
flourish
of
his
whip
as
he
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
dare

when

too

cried
Jo
,
who
resented
any
slighting
remarks
about
*NL*
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
say
anything
about
his

fire

up
when
I
admire
his
riding

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

my
goodness

that
little
goose
means
a
centaur

and
she
called
him

''
exclaimed
Jo
,
with
a
burst
of
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
be
so
rude
;
it
's
only
a
`
lapse
of
lingy
,
'
as
Mr.
Davis
*NL*
says
,
''
retorted
Amy
,
finishing
Jo
with
her
Latin
.
``
I
just
wish
I
had
a
*NL*
little
of
the
money
Laurie
spends
on
that
horse

she
added
,
as
if
to
*NL*
herself
,
yet
hoping
her
sisters
would
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Meg
kindly
,
for
Jo
had
gone
off
in
another
laugh
at
Amy
's
*NL*
second
blunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
need
it
so
much
;
I
'm
dreadfully
in
debt

and
it
wo
n't

have
the
rag-money
for
a
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In

Amy
?
What
do
you
mean

and
Meg
looked
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

I
owe
at

a
dozen
pickled
limes

I
ca

know

at

shop

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
all
about

Are
limes
the
fashion
now

It
used
to
be
pricking
*NL*
bits
of
rubber
to
make
balls
;
''
and
Meg
tried
to
keep
her
countenance
,
*NL*
Amy
looked
so
grave
and
important
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
,
the
girls
are
always
buying
them
,
and
unless
you
want
to
*NL*
be
thought
mean
,
you
must
do
it
,
too

It
's
nothing
but
limes
now
,
for
*NL*
every
one
is
sucking
them
in
their
desks
in
school-time
,
and
trading
*NL*
them
off
for

she
eats
one
before

offer
even
a
suck

treat
by
turns

I

had
ever
so
many

have

returned

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
will
pay

off

restore

asked
Meg

taking

out
her
purse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

*NL*

``

I
'll
have
a
*NL*
grand
feast
,
for
I
have
n't
tasted
a
lime

I
felt
delicate
*NL*
about
taking
any

as
I
could

I
'm
actually
suffering

for

Next
day
Amy
was
rather
late
at
school
;
but
could
not
resist
the
*NL*
temptation
of
displaying
,
with
pardonable
pride
,
a
moist
brown-paper
*NL*
parcel
,
before
she
consigned
it
to
the
inmost
recesses
of
her
desk
.
*NL*
During
the
next
few
minutes
the
rumor
that
Amy
March
had
got
twenty-four
*NL*
delicious
limes
-LRB-
she
ate
one
on
the
way
-RRB-
,
and
was
going
to
treat
,
*NL*
circulated
through
her
``
set
,
''
and
the
attentions
of
her
friends
became
*NL*
quite
overwhelming
.
Katy
Brown
invited
her
to
her
next
party
on
the
*NL*
spot
;
Mary
Kingsley
insisted
on
lending
her
her
watch
till
recess
;
and
*NL*
Jenny
Snow
,
a
satirical
young
lady
,
who
had
basely
twitted
Amy
upon
her
*NL*
limeless
state
,
promptly
buried
the
hatchet
,
and
offered
to
furnish
*NL*
answers
to
certain
appalling
sums
.
But
Amy
had
not
forgotten
Miss
Snow
's
*NL*
cutting
remarks
about
``
some
persons
whose
noses
were
not
too
flat
to
*NL*
smell
other
people
's
limes
,
and
stuck-up
people
,
who
were
not
too
proud
*NL*
to
ask
for
them
;
''
and
she
instantly
crushed
``
that
Snow
girl
's
''
hopes
by
*NL*
the
withering
telegram
,
``
You
need
n't
be
so
polite
all
of
a
sudden
,
for
*NL*
you
wo
n't
get
any
.
''

*NL*
A
distinguished
personage
happened
to
visit
the
school
that
morning
,
and
*NL*
Amy
's
beautifully
drawn
maps
received
praise
,
which
honor
to
her
foe
*NL*
rankled
in
the
soul
of
Miss
Snow
,
and
caused
Miss
March
to
assume
the
*NL*
airs
of
a
studious
young
peacock
.
But
,
alas
,
alas
!
pride
goes
before
a
*NL*
fall
,
and
the
revengeful
Snow
turned
the
tables
with
disastrous
success
.
*NL*
No
sooner
had
the
guest
paid
the
usual
stale
compliments
,
and
bowed
*NL*
himself
out
,
than
Jenny
,
under
pretence
of
asking
an
important
question
,
*NL*
informed
Mr.
Davis
,
the
teacher
,
that
Amy
March
had
pickled
limes
in
her
*NL*
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Mr.
Davis
had
declared
limes
a
contraband
article
,
and
solemnly
*NL*
vowed
to
publicly
ferrule
the
first
person
who
was
found
breaking
the
*NL*
law
.
This
much-enduring
man
had
succeeded
in
banishing
chewing-gum
after
*NL*
a
long
and
stormy
war
,
had
made
a
bonfire
of
the
confiscated
novels
and
*NL*
newspapers
,
had
suppressed
a
private
post-office
,
had
forbidden
*NL*
distortions
of
the
face
,
nicknames
,
and
caricatures
,
and
done
all
that
*NL*
one
man
could
do
to
keep
half
a
hundred
rebellious
girls
in
order
.
Boys
*NL*
are
trying
enough
to
human
patience
,
goodness
knows
!
but
girls
are
*NL*
infinitely
more
so
,
especially
to
nervous
gentlemen
,
with
tyrannical
*NL*
tempers
,
and
no
more
talent
for
teaching
than
Dr.
Blimber
.
Mr.
Davis
*NL*
knew
any
quantity
of
Greek
,
Latin
,
Algebra
,
and
ologies
of
all
sorts
,
so
*NL*
he
was
called
a
fine
teacher
;
and
manners
,
morals
,
feelings
,
and
*NL*
examples
were
not
considered
of
any
particular
importance
.
It
was
a
most
*NL*
unfortunate
moment
for
denouncing
Amy
,
and
Jenny
knew
it
.
Mr.
Davis
had
*NL*
evidently
taken
his
coffee
too
strong
that
morning
;
there
was
an
east
*NL*
wind
,
which
always
affected
his
neuralgia
;
and
his
pupils
had
not
done
*NL*
him
the
credit
which
he
felt
he
deserved
:
therefore
,
to
use
the
*NL*
expressive
,
if
not
elegant
,
language
of
a
school-girl
,
``
he
was
as
*NL*
nervous
as
a
witch
and
as
cross
as
a
bear
.
''
The
word
``
limes
''
was
like
*NL*
fire
to
powder
;
his
yellow
face
flushed
,
and
he
rapped
on
his
desk
with
*NL*
an
energy
which
made
Jenny
skip
to
her
seat
with
unusual
rapidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
ladies
,
attention
,
if
you
please
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
stern
order
the
buzz
ceased
,
and
fifty
pairs
of
blue
,
black
,
*NL*
gray
,
and
brown
eyes
were
obediently
fixed
upon
his
awful
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
March
,
come
to
the
desk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
rose
to
comply
with
outward
composure
,
but
a
secret
fear
oppressed
*NL*
her
,
for
the
limes
weighed
upon
her
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
with
you
the
limes
you
have
in
your
desk
,
''
was
the
unexpected
*NL*
command
which
arrested
her
before
she
got
out
of
her
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
all
,
''
whispered
her
neighbor
,
a
young
lady
of
great
presence
*NL*
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
hastily
shook
out
half
a
dozen
,
and
laid
the
rest
down
before
Mr.
*NL*
Davis
,
feeling
that
any
man
possessing
a
human
heart
would
relent
when
*NL*
that
delicious
perfume
met
his
nose
.
Unfortunately
,
Mr.
Davis
*NL*
particularly
detested
the
odor
of
the
fashionable
pickle
,
and
disgust
*NL*
added
to
his
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
,
''
stammered
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
the
rest
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
despairing
glance
at
her
set
,
she
obeyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sure
there
are
no
more

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I

Now
take
these
disgusting
things
two
by
two
,
and
throw
them
*NL*
out
of

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
simultaneous
sigh
,
which
created
quite
a
little
gust
,
as
the
*NL*
last
hope
fled
,
and
the
treat
was
ravished
from
their
longing
lips
.
*NL*
Scarlet
with
shame
and
anger
,
Amy
went
to
and
fro
six
dreadful
times
;
*NL*
and
as
each
doomed
couple
--
looking
oh
!
so
plump
and
juicy
--
fell
from
her
*NL*
reluctant
hands
,
a
shout
from
the
street
completed
the
anguish
of
the
*NL*
girls
,
for
it
told
them
that
their
feast
was
being
exulted
over
by
the
*NL*
little
Irish
children
,
who
were
their
sworn
foes
.
This
--
this
was
too
*NL*
much
;
all
flashed
indignant
or
appealing
glances
at
the
inexorable
*NL*
Davis
,
and
one
passionate
lime-lover
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Amy
returned
from
her
last
trip
,
Mr.
Davis
gave
a
portentous
``
Hem
!
''
*NL*
and
said
,
in
his
most
impressive
manner
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
ladies
,
you
remember
what
I
said
to
you
a
week
ago
.
I
am
sorry
*NL*
this
has
happened
,
but
I
never
allow
my
rules
to
be
infringed
,
and
I
*NL*
_
never
_
break
my
word
.
Miss
March
,
hold
out
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
started
,
and
put
both
hands
behind
her
,
turning
on
him
an
imploring
*NL*
look
which
pleaded
for
her
better
than
the
words
she
could
not
utter
.
*NL*
She
was
rather
a
favorite
with
``
old
Davis
,
''
as
,
of
course
,
he
was
*NL*
called
,
and
it
's
my
private
belief
that
he
_
would
_
have
broken
his
word
*NL*
if
the
indignation
of
one
irrepressible
young
lady
had
not
found
vent
in
*NL*
a
hiss
.
That
hiss
,
faint
as
it
was
,
irritated
the
irascible
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
sealed
the
culprit
's
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hand
,
Miss
March
!
''
was
the
only
answer
her
mute
appeal
received
;
*NL*
and
,
too
proud
to
cry
or
beseech
,
Amy
set
her
teeth
,
threw
back
her
*NL*
head
defiantly
,
and
bore
without
flinching
several
tingling
blows
on
her
*NL*
little
palm
.
They
were
neither
many
nor
heavy
,
but
that
made
no
*NL*
difference
to
her
.
For
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
had
been
struck
;
*NL*
and
the
disgrace
,
in
her
eyes
,
was
as
deep
as
if
he
had
knocked
her
*NL*
down
.

*NL*
``
You
will
now
stand
on
the
platform
till
recess
,
''
said
Mr.
Davis
,
*NL*
resolved
to
do
the
thing
thoroughly
,
since
he
had
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
dreadful
.
It
would
have
been
bad
enough
to
go
to
her
seat
,
and
*NL*
see
the
pitying
faces
of
her
friends
,
or
the
satisfied
ones
of
her
few
*NL*
enemies
;
but
to
face
the
whole
school
,
with
that
shame
fresh
upon
her
,
*NL*
seemed
impossible
,
and
for
a
second
she
felt
as
if
she
could
only
drop
*NL*
down
where
she
stood
,
and
break
her
heart
with
crying
.
A
bitter
sense
of
*NL*
wrong
,
and
the
thought
of
Jenny
Snow
,
helped
her
to
bear
it
;
and
,
taking
*NL*
the
ignominious
place
,
she
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
stove-funnel
above
what
*NL*
now
seemed
a
sea
of
faces
,
and
stood
there
,
so
motionless
and
white
that
*NL*
the
girls
found
it
very
hard
to
study
,
with
that
pathetic
figure
before
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
fifteen
minutes
that
followed
,
the
proud
and
sensitive
little
*NL*
girl
suffered
a
shame
and
pain
which
she
never
forgot
.
To
others
it
*NL*
might
seem
a
ludicrous
or
trivial
affair
,
but
to
her
it
was
a
hard
*NL*
experience
;
for
during
the
twelve
years
of
her
life
she
had
been
*NL*
governed
by
love
alone
,
and
a
blow
of
that
sort
had
never
touched
her
*NL*
before
.
The
smart
of
her
hand
and
the
ache
of
her
heart
were
forgotten
*NL*
in
the
sting
of
the
thought
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
to
tell
at
home
,
and
they
will
be
so
disappointed
in
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifteen
minutes
seemed
an
hour
;
but
they
came
to
an
end
at
last
,
and
*NL*
the
word
``
Recess
!
''
had
never
seemed
so
welcome
to
her
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
go
,
Miss
March
,
''
said
Mr.
Davis
,
looking
,
as
he
felt
,
*NL*
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
soon
forget
the
reproachful
glance
Amy
gave
him
,
as
she
went
,
*NL*
without
a
word
to
any
one
,
straight
into
the
ante-room
,
snatched
her
*NL*
things
,
and
left
the
place
``
forever
,
''
as
she
passionately
declared
to
*NL*
herself
.
She
was
in
a
sad
state
when
she
got
home
;
and
when
the
older
*NL*
girls
arrived
,
some
time
later
,
an
indignation
meeting
was
held
at
*NL*
once
.
Mrs.
March
did
not
say
much
,
but
looked
disturbed
,
and
comforted
*NL*
her
afflicted
little
daughter
in
her
tenderest
manner
.
Meg
bathed
the
*NL*
insulted
hand
with
glycerine
and
tears
;
Beth
felt
that
even
her
beloved
*NL*
kittens
would
fail
as
a
balm
for
griefs
like
this
;
Jo
wrath
fully
*NL*
proposed
that
Mr.
Davis
be
arrested
without
delay
;
and
Hannah
shook
her
*NL*
fist
at
the
``
villain
,
''
and
pounded
potatoes
for
dinner
as
if
she
had
him
*NL*
under
her
pestle
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
notice
was
taken
of
Amy
's
flight
,
except
by
her
mates
;
but
the
*NL*
sharp-eyed
demoiselles
discovered
that
Mr.
Davis
was
quite
benignant
in
*NL*
the
afternoon
,
also
unusually
nervous
.
Just
before
school
closed
,
Jo
*NL*
appeared
,
wearing
a
grim
expression
,
as
she
stalked
up
to
the
desk
,
and
*NL*
delivered
a
letter
from
her
mother
;
then
collected
Amy
's
property
,
and
*NL*
departed
,
carefully
scraping
the
mud
from
her
boots
on
the
door-mat
,
as
*NL*
if
she
shook
the
dust
of
the
place
off
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
can
have
a
vacation
from
school
,
but
I
want
you
to
study
a
*NL*
little
every
day
,
with
Beth
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
that
evening
.
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
approve
of
corporal
punishment
,
especially
for
girls
.
I
dislike
Mr.
*NL*
Davis
's
manner
of
teaching
,
and
do
n't
think
the
girls
you
associate
with
*NL*
are
doing
you
any
good
,
so
I
shall
ask
your
father
's
advice
before
I
*NL*
send
you
anywhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good
!
I
wish
all
the
girls
would
leave
,
and
spoil
his
old
*NL*
school
.
It
's
perfectly
maddening
to
think
of
those
lovely
limes
,
''
sighed
*NL*
Amy
,
with
the
air
of
a
martyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
sorry
you
lost
them
,
for
you
broke
the
rules
,
and
deserved
*NL*
some
punishment
for
disobedience
,
''
was
the
severe
reply
,
which
rather
*NL*
disappointed
the
young
lady
,
who
expected
nothing
but
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
you
are
glad
I
was
disgraced
before
the
whole
school
?
''
*NL*
cried
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
chosen
that
way
of
mending
a
fault
,
''
replied
her
*NL*
mother
;
``
but
I
'm
not
sure
that
it
wo
n't
do
you
more
good
than
a
milder
*NL*
method
.
You
are
getting
to
be
rather
conceited
,
my
dear
,
and
it
is
quite
*NL*
time
you
set
about
correcting
it
.
You
have
a
good
many
little
gifts
and
*NL*
virtues
,
but
there
is
no
need
of
parading
them
,
for
conceit
spoils
the
*NL*
finest
genius
.
There
is
not
much
danger
that
real
talent
or
goodness
*NL*
will
be
overlooked
long
;
even
if
it
is
,
the
consciousness
of
possessing
*NL*
and
using
it
well
should
satisfy
one
,
and
the
great
charm
of
all
power
*NL*
is
modesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
!
''
cried
Laurie
,
who
was
playing
chess
in
a
corner
with
Jo
.
``
I
*NL*
knew
a
girl
,
once
,
who
had
a
really
remarkable
talent
for
music
,
and
she
*NL*
did
n't
know
it
;
never
guessed
what
sweet
little
things
she
composed
when
*NL*
she
was
alone
,
and
would
n't
have
believed
it
if
any
one
had
told
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
'd
known
that
nice
girl
;
maybe
she
would
have
helped
me
,
I
'm
so
*NL*
stupid
,
''
said
Beth
,
who
stood
beside
him
,
listening
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
know
her
,
and
she
helps
you
better
than
any
one
else
could
,
''
*NL*
answered
Laurie
,
looking
at
her
with
such
mischievous
meaning
in
his
*NL*
merry
black
eyes
,
that
Beth
suddenly
turned
very
red
,
and
hid
her
face
*NL*
in
the
sofa-cushion
,
quite
overcome
by
such
an
unexpected
discovery
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
let
Laurie
win
the
game
,
to
pay
for
that
praise
of
her
Beth
,
who
*NL*
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
play
for
them
after
her
compliment
.
So
*NL*
Laurie
did
his
best
,
and
sung
delightfully
,
being
in
a
particularly
*NL*
lively
humor
,
for
to
the
Marches
he
seldom
showed
the
moody
side
of
his
*NL*
character
.
When
he
was
gone
,
Amy
,
who
had
been
pensive
all
the
evening
,
*NL*
said
suddenly
,
as
if
busy
over
some
new
idea
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Laurie
an
accomplished
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
he
has
had
an
excellent
education
,
and
has
much
talent
;
he
will
*NL*
make
a
fine
man
,
if
not
spoilt
by
petting
,
''
replied
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
he
is
n't
conceited
,
is
he
?
''
asked
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
in
the
least
;
that
is
why
he
is
so
charming
,
and
we
all
like
him
so
*NL*
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
;
it
's
nice
to
have
accomplishments
,
and
be
elegant
;
but
not
to
*NL*
show
off
,
or
get
perked
up
,
''
said
Amy
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
things
are
always
seen
and
felt
in
a
person
's
manner
and
*NL*
conversation
,
if
modestly
used
;
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
display
*NL*
them
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Any
more
than
it
's
proper

wear
all
your

gowns

ribbons
at
once

folks
may
know
you

added
Jo
;
and
the
*NL*
lecture
ended
in
a
laugh

one
*NL*
Saturday
afternoon

finding
them
getting
ready
to
go
out
,
with
an
*NL*
air
of
secrecy
which
excited
her
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

returned
Jo
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
if
there
_
is
_
anything
mortifying
to
our
feelings
,
when
we
are
*NL*
young
,
it
is
to
be
told
that
;
and
to
be
bidden
to
``

is
*NL*
still
more
trying

Amy
bridled
up
at
this
insult
,
and
determined
*NL*
to
find
out
the
secret
,
if
she
teased
for
an
hour
.
Turning
to
Meg
,
who
*NL*
never
refused
her
anything
very
long
,
she
said
coaxingly
,
``
Do
tell
me

I
*NL*

``

Amy
held

used

well
,
''
began
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
_
she
_
goes
_
I
_
sha
'n'
t
;
and
if
I
do
n't
,
Laurie
wo
n't
like
it
;
and
it
*NL*
will
be
very
rude
,
after
he
invited
only
us
,
to
go
and
drag
in
Amy
.
I
*NL*
should
think
she
'd
hate
to
poke
herself
where
she
is
n't
wanted
,
''
said
Jo
*NL*
crossly
,
for
she
disliked
the
trouble
of
overseeing
a
fidgety
child
,
*NL*
when
she
wanted
to
enjoy
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tone
and
manner
angered
Amy
,
who
began
to
put
her
boots
on
,
saying
,
*NL*
in
her
most
aggravating
way
,
``
I
_
shall
_
go
;
Meg
says
I
may
;
and
if
I
pay
*NL*
for
myself
,
Laurie
has
n't
anything
to
do
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
sit
with
us
,
for
our
seats
are
reserved
,
and
you
must
n't
sit
*NL*
alone
;
so
Laurie
will
give
you
his
place
,
and
that
will
spoil
our
*NL*
pleasure
;
or
he
'll
get
another
seat
for
you
,
and
that
is
n't
proper
,
when
*NL*
you
were
n't
asked
.
You
sha
'n'
t
stir
a
step
;
so
you
may
just
stay
where
*NL*
you
are
,
''
scolded
Jo
,
crosser
than
ever
,
having
just
pricked
her
finger
*NL*
in
her
hurry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
on
the
floor
,
with
one
boot
on
,
Amy
began
to
cry
,
and
Meg
to
*NL*
reason
with
her
,
when
Laurie
called
from
below
,
and
the
two
girls
*NL*
hurried
down
,
leaving
their
sister
wailing
;
for
now
and
then
she
forgot
*NL*
her
grown-up
ways
,
and
acted
like
a
spoilt
child
.
Just
as
the
party
was
*NL*
setting
out
,
Amy
called
over
the
banisters
,
in
a
threatening
tone
,
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
sorry
for
this
,
Jo
March
;
see
if
you
ai
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fiddlesticks
!
''
returned
Jo
,
slamming
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
charming
time
,
for
``
The
Seven
Castles
of
the
Diamond
Lake
''
*NL*
were
as
brilliant
and
wonderful
as
heart
could
wish
.
But
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
comical
red
imps
,
sparkling
elves
,
and
gorgeous
princes
and
*NL*
princesses
,
Jo
's
pleasure
had
a
drop
of
bitterness
in
it
;
the
fairy
*NL*
queen
's
yellow
curls
reminded
her
of
Amy
;
and
between
the
acts
she
*NL*
amused
herself
with
wondering
what
her
sister
would
do
to
make
her
*NL*
``
sorry
for
it
.
''
She
and
Amy
had
had
many
lively
skirmishes
in
the
course
*NL*
of
their
lives
,
for
both
had
quick
tempers
,
and
were
apt
to
be
violent
*NL*
when
fairly
roused
.
Amy
teased
Jo
,
and
Jo
irritated
Amy
,
and
*NL*
semi-occasional
explosions
occurred
,
of
which
both
were
much
ashamed
*NL*
afterward
.
Although
the
oldest
,
Jo
had
the
least
self-control
,
and
had
*NL*
hard
times
trying
to
curb
the
fiery
spirit
which
was
continually
getting
*NL*
her
into
trouble
;
her
anger
never
lasted
long
,
and
,
having
humbly
*NL*
confessed
her
fault
,
she
sincerely
repented
,
and
tried
to
do
better
.
Her
*NL*
sisters
used
to
say
that
they
rather
liked
to
get
Jo
into
a
fury
,
*NL*
because
she
was
such
an
angel
afterward
.
Poor
Jo
tried
desperately
to
be
*NL*
good
,
but
her
bosom
enemy
was
always
ready
to
flame
up
and
defeat
her
;
*NL*
and
it
took
years
of
patient
effort
to
subdue
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
home
,
they
found
Amy
reading
in
the
parlor
.
She
assumed
an
*NL*
injured
air
as
they
came
in
;
never
lifted
her
eyes
from
her
book
,
or
*NL*
asked
a
single
question
.
Perhaps
curiosity
might
have
conquered
*NL*
resentment
,
if
Beth
had
not
been
there
to
inquire
,
and
receive
a
glowing
*NL*
description
of
the
play
.
On
going
up
to
put
away
her
best
hat
,
Jo
's
*NL*
first
look
was
toward
the
bureau
;
for
,
in
their
last
quarrel
,
Amy
had
*NL*
soothed
her
feelings
by
turning
Jo
's
top
drawer
upside
down
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
Everything
was
in
its
place
,
however
;
and
after
a
hasty
glance
*NL*
into
her
various
closets
,
bags
,
and
boxes
,
Jo
decided
that
Amy
had
*NL*
forgiven
and
forgotten
her
wrongs
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
Jo
was
mistaken
;
for
next
day
she
made
a
discovery
which
produced
*NL*
a
tempest
.
Meg
,
Beth
,
and
Amy
were
sitting
together
,
late
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
when
Jo
burst
into
the
room
,
looking
excited
,
and
demanding
*NL*
breathlessly
,
``
Has
any
one
taken
my
book
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
and
Beth
said
``
No
,
''
at
once
,
and
looked
surprised
;
Amy
poked
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
said
nothing
.
Jo
saw
her
color
rise
,
and
was
down
upon
her
in
*NL*
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amy
,
you
've
got
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
where
it
is
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
fib
!
''
cried
Jo
,
taking
her
by
the
shoulders
,
and
looking
*NL*
fierce
enough
to
frighten
a
much
braver
child
than
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
.
I
have
n't
got
it
,
do
n't
know
where
it
is
now
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
something
about
it
,
and
you
'd
better
tell
at
once
,
or
I
'll
*NL*
make
you
,
''
and
Jo
gave
her
a
slight
shake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Scold
as
much
as
you
like
,
you
'll
never
see
your
silly
old
book
again
,
''
*NL*
cried
Amy
,
getting
excited
in
her
turn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
burnt
it
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
I
burnt
it
up
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
my
little
book
I
was
so
fond
of
,
and
worked
over
,
and
meant
to
*NL*
finish
before
father
got
home
?
Have
you
really
burnt
it
?
''
said
Jo
,
*NL*
turning
very
pale
,
while
her
eyes
kindled
and
her
hands
clutched
Amy
*NL*
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
did
!
I
told
you
I
'd
make
you
pay
for
being
so
cross
yesterday
,
*NL*
and
I
have
,
so
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
got
no
farther
,
for
Jo
's
hot
temper
mastered
her
,
and
she
shook
Amy
*NL*
till
her
teeth
chattered
in
her
head
;
crying
,
in
a
passion
of
grief
and
*NL*
anger
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wicked
,
wicked
girl
!
I
never
can
write
it
again
,
and
I
'll
never
*NL*
forgive
you
as
long
as
I
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
flew
to
rescue
Amy
,
and
Beth
to
pacify
Jo
,
but
Jo
was
quite
beside
*NL*
herself
;
and
,
with
a
parting
box
on
her
sister
's
ear
,
she
rushed
out
of
*NL*
the
room
up
to
the
old
sofa
in
the
garret
,
and
finished
her
fight
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
storm
cleared
up
below
,
for
Mrs.
March
came
home
,
and
,
having
heard
*NL*
the
story
,
soon
brought
Amy
to
a
sense
of
the
wrong
she
had
done
her
*NL*
sister
.
Jo
's
book
was
the
pride
of
her
heart
,
and
was
regarded
by
her
*NL*
family
as
a
literary
sprout
of
great
promise
.
It
was
only
half
a
dozen
*NL*
little
fairy
tales
,
but
Jo
had
worked
over
them
patiently
,
putting
her
*NL*
whole
heart
into
her
work
,
hoping
to
make
something
good
enough
to
*NL*
print
.
She
had
just
copied
them
with
great
care
,
and
had
destroyed
the
*NL*
old
manuscript
,
so
that
Amy
's
bonfire
had
consumed
the
loving
work
of
*NL*
several
years
.
It
seemed
a
small
loss
to
others
,
but
to
Jo
it
was
a
*NL*
dreadful
calamity
,
and
she
felt
that
it
never
could
be
made
up
to
her
.
*NL*
Beth
mourned
as
for
a
departed
kitten
,
and
Meg
refused
to
defend
her
*NL*
pet
;
Mrs.
March
looked
grave
and
grieved
,
and
Amy
felt
that
no
one
would
*NL*
love
her
till
she
had
asked
pardon
for
the
act
which
she
now
regretted
*NL*
more
than
any
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
tea-bell
rung
,
Jo
appeared
,
looking
so
grim
and
unapproachable
*NL*
that
it
took
all
Amy
's
courage
to
say
meekly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
forgive
me
,
Jo
;
I
'm
very
,
very
sorry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
shall
forgive
you
,
''
was
Jo
's
stern
answer
;
and
,
from
that
*NL*
moment
,
she
ignored
Amy
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
spoke
of
the
great
trouble
,
--
not
even
Mrs.
March
,
--
for
all
had
*NL*
learned
by
experience
that
when
Jo
was
in
that
mood
words
were
wasted
;
*NL*
and
the
wisest
course
was
to
wait
till
some
little
accident
,
or
her
own
*NL*
generous
nature
,
softened
Jo
's
resentment
,
and
healed
the
breach
.
It
was
*NL*
not
a
happy
evening
;
for
,
though
they
sewed
as
usual
,
while
their
mother
*NL*
read
aloud
from
Bremer
,
Scott
,
or
Edgeworth
,
something
was
wanting
,
and
*NL*
the
sweet
home-peace
was
disturbed
.
They
felt
this
most
when
*NL*
singing-time
came
;
for
Beth
could
only
play
,
Jo
stood
dumb
as
a
stone
,
*NL*
and
Amy
broke
down
,
so
Meg
and
mother
sung
alone
.
But
,
in
spite
of
their
*NL*
efforts
to
be
as
cheery
as
larks
,
the
flute-like
voices
did
not
seem
to
*NL*
chord
as
well
as
usual
,
and
all
felt
out
of
tune
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Jo
received
her
good-night
kiss
,
Mrs.
March
whispered
gently
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
do
n't
let
the
sun
go
down
upon
your
anger
;
forgive
each
other
,
*NL*
help
each
other
,
and
begin
again
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
wanted
to
lay
her
head
down
on
that
motherly
bosom
,
and
cry
her
grief
*NL*
and
anger
all
away
;
but
tears
were
an
unmanly
weakness
,
and
she
felt
so
*NL*
deeply
injured
that
she
really
_
could
n't
_
quite
forgive
yet
.
So
she
*NL*
winked
hard
,
shook
her
head
,
and
said
,
gruffly
because
Amy
was
*NL*
listening
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
an
abominable
thing
,
and
she
do
n't
deserve
to
be
forgiven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
she
marched
off
to
bed
,
and
there
was
no
merry
or
confidential
*NL*
gossip
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
was
much
offended
that
her
overtures
of
peace
had
been
repulsed
,
and
*NL*
began
to
wish
she
had
not
humbled
herself
,
to
feel
more
injured
than
*NL*
ever
,
and
to
plume
herself
on
her
superior
virtue
in
a
way
which
was
*NL*
particularly
exasperating
.
Jo
still
looked
like
a
thunder-cloud
,
and
*NL*
nothing
went
well
all
day
.
It
was
bitter
cold
in
the
morning
;
she
*NL*
dropped
her
precious
turn-over
in
the
gutter
,
Aunt
March
had
an
attack
*NL*
of
fidgets
,
Meg
was
pensive
,
Beth
_
would
_
look
grieved
and
wistful
when
*NL*
she
got
home
,
and
Amy
kept
making
remarks
about
people
who
were
always
*NL*
talking
about
being
good
,
and
yet
would
n't
try
,
when
other
people
set
*NL*
them
a
virtuous
example
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everybody
is
so
hateful
,
I
'll
ask
Laurie
to
go
skating
.
He
is
always
*NL*
kind
and
jolly
,
and
will
put
me
to
rights
,
I
know
,
''
said
Jo
to
herself
,
*NL*
and
off
she
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
heard
the
clash
of
skates
,
and
looked
out
with
an
impatient
*NL*
exclamation
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
she
promised
I
should
go
next
time
,
for
this
is
the
last
ice
we
*NL*
shall
have
.
But
it
's
no
use
to
ask
such
a
cross-patch
to
take
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
that
;
you
_
were
_
very
naughty
,
and
it
_
is
_
hard
to
forgive
*NL*
the
loss
of
her
precious
little
book
;
but
I
think
she
might
do
it
now
,
*NL*
and
I
guess
she
will
,
if
you
try
her
at
the
right
minute
,
''
said
Meg
.
``
Go
*NL*
after
them
;
do
n't
say
anything
till
Jo
has
got
good-natured
with
Laurie
,
*NL*
then
take
a
quiet
minute
,
and
just
kiss
her
,
or
do
some
kind
thing
,
and
*NL*
I
'm
sure
she
'll
be
friends
again
,
with
all
her
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
,
''
said
Amy
,
for
the
advice
suited
her
;
and
,
after
a
flurry
to
*NL*
get
ready
,
she
ran
after
the
friends
,
who
were
just
disappearing
over
*NL*
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
far
to
the
river
,
but
both
were
ready
before
Amy
reached
*NL*
them
.
Jo
saw
her
coming
,
and
turned
her
back
;
Laurie
did
not
see
,
for
he
*NL*
was
carefully
skating
along
the
shore
,
sounding
the
ice
,
for
a
warm
*NL*
spell
had
preceded
the
cold
snap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
on
to
the
first
bend
,
and
see
if
it
's
all
right
,
before
we
*NL*
begin
to
race
,
''
Amy
heard
him
say
,
as
he
shot
away
,
looking
like
a
young
*NL*
Russian
,
in
his
fur-trimmed
coat
and
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
heard
Amy
panting
after
her
run
,
stamping
her
feet
and
blowing
her
*NL*
fingers
,
as
she
tried
to
put
her
skates
on
;
but
Jo
never
turned
,
and
*NL*
went
slowly
zigzagging
down
the
river
,
taking
a
bitter
,
unhappy
sort
of
*NL*
satisfaction
in
her
sister
's
troubles
.
She
had
cherished
her
anger
till
*NL*
it
grew
strong
,
and
took
possession
of
her
,
as
evil
thoughts
and
*NL*
feelings
always
do
,
unless
cast
out
at
once
.
As
Laurie
turned
the
bend
,
*NL*
he
shouted
back
,
--
*NL*

Jo
heard
,
but
Amy
was
just
struggling
to
her
feet
,
and
did
not
catch
a
*NL*
word
.
Jo
glanced
over
her
shoulder
,
and
the
little
demon
she
was
*NL*
harboring
said
in
her
ear
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

whether

not
,
let
her
take
care

*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
had
vanished
round
the
bend
;
Jo
was
just
at
the
turn
,
and
Amy
,
*NL*
far
behind
,
striking
out
toward
the
smoother
ice
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
river
.
For
a
minute
Jo
stood
still
,
with
a
strange
feeling
at
her
heart
;
*NL*
then
she
resolved
to
go
on
,
but
something
held
and
turned
her
round
,
*NL*
just
in
time
to
see
Amy
throw
up
her
hands
and
go
down
,
with
the
sudden
*NL*
crash
of
rotten
ice
,
the
splash
of
water
,
and
a
cry
that
made
Jo
's
heart
*NL*
stand
still
with
fear
.
She
tried
to
call
Laurie
,
but
her
voice
was
gone
;
*NL*
she
tried
to
rush
forward
,
but
her
feet
seemed
to
have
no
strength
in
*NL*
them
;
and
,
for
a
second
,
she
could
only
stand
motionless
,
staring
,
with
*NL*
a
terror-stricken
face
,
at
the
little
blue
hood
above
the
black
water
.
*NL*
Something
rushed
swiftly
by
her
,
and
Laurie
's
voice
cried
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bring
a
rail
;
quick
,
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
she
did
it
,
she
never
knew
;
but
for
the
next
few
minutes
she
worked
*NL*
as
if
possessed
,
blindly
obeying
Laurie
,
who
was
quite
self-possessed
,
*NL*
and
,
lying
flat
,
held
Amy
up
by
his
arm
and
hockey
till
Jo
dragged
a
*NL*
rail
from
the
fence
,
and
together
they
got
the
child
out
,
more
*NL*
frightened
than
hurt
.

while
I
get
off
these
confounded
skates
,
''
cried
Laurie
,
wrapping
*NL*
his
coat
round
Amy
,
and
tugging
away
at
the
straps
,
which
never
seemed
*NL*
so
intricate
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shivering
,
dripping
,
and
crying
,
they
got
Amy
home
;
and
,
after
an
*NL*
exciting
time
of
it
,
she
fell
asleep
,
rolled
in
blankets
,
before
a
hot
*NL*
fire
.
During
the
bustle
Jo
had
scarcely
spoken
;
but
flown
about
,
looking
*NL*
pale
and
wild
,
with
her
things
half
off
,
her
dress
torn
,
and
her
hands
*NL*
cut
and
bruised
by
ice
and
rails
,
and
refractory
buckles
.
When
Amy
was
*NL*
comfortably
asleep
,
the
house
quiet
,
and
Mrs.
March
sitting
by
the
bed
,
*NL*
she
called
Jo
to
her
,
and
began
to
bind
up
the
hurt
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
she
is
safe
?
''
whispered
Jo
,
looking
remorsefully
at
the
*NL*
golden
head
,
which
might
have
been
swept
away
from
her
sight
forever
*NL*
under
the
treacherous
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
safe

she
is
not
hurt

wo
n't

I

you
were
so
sensible
in
covering

replied
*NL*
her
mother
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
would
be

;
and
Jo
dropped
down
beside
the
bed
,
in
a
passion
of
*NL*
penitent
tears
,
telling
all
that
had
happened
,
bitterly
condemning
her
*NL*
hardness
of
heart
,
and
sobbing
out
her
gratitude
for
being
spared
the
*NL*
heavy
punishment
which
might
have
come
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

breaks
out
worse

I
do

what

*NL*
cried
poor
Jo
,
in
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watch

said
Mrs.
March
,
drawing
the
blowzy
*NL*
head
to
her
shoulder
,
and
kissing
the
wet
cheek
so
tenderly
that
Jo
*NL*
cried
harder
than
ever

*NL*
*NL*

savage

*NL*

the

be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yours

Why

you
are
never

and
,
for
the
moment

Jo
*NL*
forgot
remorse
in
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

been

angry
nearly
every

Jo

but
I
have
*NL*
learned
not
to
show
it

and
I
still
hope

learn

feel
it

*NL*
it
may
take

another

*NL*
*NL*
The
patience
and
the
humility
of
the
face
she
loved
so
well
was
a
better
*NL*
lesson
to
Jo
than
the
wisest
lecture
,
the
sharpest
reproof
.
She
felt
*NL*
comforted
at
once
by
the
sympathy
and
confidence
given
her
;
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
her
mother
had
a
fault
like
hers
,
and
tried
to
mend
it
,
*NL*
made
her
own
easier
to
bear
and
strengthened
her
resolution

cure
it

though
forty
years
seemed
rather
a
long
time
to
watch
and
pray
,
to
a
*NL*
girl
of
fifteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

nearer

*NL*
*NL*

when
I
feel
that
they

to
break
out

I
just
go
away

a

*NL*
answered
Mrs.

,
with
a
sigh

a
smile

as
she
smoothed

fastened
up
Jo

dishevelled
hair

*NL*
*NL*

you

``

interrupted
Jo
,
with
a
grateful
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
lost
her
when
I
was
a

on
alone

I

proud

I
had
a
hard

I
never

on

Then
your
father
came
,

I
was
so
happy

I
found
it
easy
to
be

good

But
by

by
,
when
I
had
four
little
daughters
round
me

we
*NL*
were
poor

then
the
old
trouble
began
again
;
for
I
am
not
patient
by

nature

it
tried
me
very
much

see
my
children

anything

*NL*
``

Your

never

patience

never
doubts

always
hopes

works

waits
so
cheerfully

that
*NL*
one
is
ashamed

do
otherwise

him

He
helped

comforted
me

showed
me
that
I
must
try

practise
all
the
virtues
I
would
have

a
startled

look

you

Jo
saw

how
faithfully

*NL*
``

wondering

``
I
gave

Why
should
I
complain

when
we
both
have
merely
done
our
duty

will
surely
be

If

it

you
learn
to
feel
the
strength

tenderness

your
Heavenly
Father
as
*NL*
you
do
that
of

earthly
one

The
more
you
love

trust
Him

the
*NL*
nearer
you
will
feel

Him

the
less
you
will
depend
on
human
power

and
wisdom

His
love

care
never

can
never
be
taken

life-long
peace

cares

sins

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
only
answer
was
to
hold
her

close
,

,
in
the
silence
which
*NL*
followed
,
the
sincerest
prayer
she
had
ever
prayed
left
her
heart
*NL*
without
words
;
for
in
that
sad

yet
happy
hour
,
she
had
learned
not
only
*NL*
the
bitterness
of
remorse
and
despair
,
but
the
sweetness
of
self-denial
*NL*
and
self-control
;
and
,
led
by
her
mother
's
hand
,
she
had
drawn
nearer
to
*NL*
the
Friend
who
welcomes
every

a

stronger

that

any

Amy
stirred

Jo
looked

n't
forgive
her
,
and
to-day
,
*NL*
if
it
had
n't
been
for
Laurie
,
it
might
have
been
too
late
!
How
could
I
*NL*
be
so
wicked
?
''
said
Jo
,
half
aloud
,
as
she
leaned
over
her
sister
,
*NL*
softly
stroking
the
wet
hair
scattered
on
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
she
heard
,
Amy
opened
her
eyes
,
and
held
out
her
arms
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
that
went
straight
to
Jo
's
heart
.
Neither
said
a
word
,
but
they
*NL*
hugged
one
another
close
,
in
spite
of
the
blankets
,
and
everything
was
*NL*
forgiven
and
forgotten
in
one
hearty
kiss
.

it
was
the
most
fortunate
thing
in
the
world
that
those

said
Meg
,
one
April
day
,
as
*NL*
she
stood
packing
the

in
her
room

surrounded
by
her

*NL*
*NL*

And
so
nice
of
Annie

A

fortnight
of

splendid

''
replied
Jo
,
looking
like
a
*NL*
windmill
,
as
she
folded
skirts
with
her
long
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
such
lovely
weather
;
I
'm
so
glad
of
that

added
Beth
,
tidily
*NL*
sorting
neck
and
hair
ribbons
in
her
best
box
,
lent
for
the
great
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
was
going
to
have
a
fine
time
,
and
wear
all
these
nice
*NL*
things
,
''
said
Amy
,
with
her
mouth
full
of
pins
,
as
she
artistically
*NL*
replenished
her
sister
's
cushion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
were
all
going
;
but
,
as
you
ca
n't
,
I
shall
keep
my
*NL*
adventures
to
tell
you
when
I
come
back
.
I
'm
sure
it
's
the
least
I
can
*NL*
do
,
when
you
have
been
so
kind
,
lending
me
things
,
and
helping
me
get
*NL*
ready
,
''
said
Meg
,
glancing
round
the
room
at
the
very
simple
outfit
,
*NL*
which
seemed
nearly
perfect
in
their
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
mother
give
you
out
of
the
treasure-box
?
''
asked
Amy
,
who
had
*NL*
not
been
present
at
the
opening
of
a
certain
cedar
chest
,
in
which
Mrs.
*NL*
March
kept
a
few
relics
of
past
splendor
,
as
gifts
for
her
girls
when
*NL*
the
proper
time
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pair
of
silk
stockings
,
that
pretty
carved
fan
,
and
a
lovely
blue
*NL*
sash
.
I
wanted
the
violet
silk
;
but
there
is
n't
time
to
make
it
over
,
so
*NL*
I
must
be
contented
with
my
old
tarlatan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
look
nicely
over
my
new
muslin
skirt
,
and
the
sash
will
set
it
*NL*
off
beautifully
.
I
wish
I
had
n't
smashed
my
coral
bracelet
,
for
you
*NL*
might
have
had
it
,
''
said
Jo
,
who
loved
to
give
and
lend
,
but
whose
*NL*
possessions
were
usually
too
dilapidated
to
be
of
much
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
lovely
old-fashioned
pearl
set
in
the
treasure-box
;
but
*NL*
mother
said
real
flowers
were
the
prettiest
ornament
for
a
young
girl
,
*NL*
and
Laurie
promised
to
send
me
all
I
want
,
''
replied
Meg
.
``
Now
,
let
me
*NL*
see
;
there
's
my
new
gray
walking-suit
--
just
curl
up
the
feather
in
my
*NL*
hat
,
Beth
,
--
then
my
poplin
,
for
Sunday
,
and
the
small
party
,
--
it
looks
*NL*
heavy
for
spring
,
does
n't
it
?
The
violet
silk
would
be
so
nice
;
oh
,
*NL*
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
;
you
've
got
the
tarlatan
for
the
big
party
,
and
you
always
*NL*
look
like
an
angel
in
white
,
''
said
Amy
,
brooding
over
the
little
store
*NL*
of
finery
in
which
her
soul
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
low-necked
,
and
it
does
n't
sweep
enough
,
but
it
will
have
to
*NL*
do
.
My
blue
house-dress
looks
so
well
,
turned
and
freshly
trimmed
,
that
*NL*
I
feel
as
if
I
'd
got
a
new
one
.
My
silk
sacque
is
n't
a
bit
the
fashion
,
*NL*
and
my
bonnet
does
n't
look
like
Sallie
's
;
I
did
n't
like
to
say
*NL*
anything
,
but
I
was
sadly
disappointed
in
my
umbrella
.
I
told
mother
*NL*
black
,
with
a
white
handle
,
but
she
forgot
,
and
bought
a
green
one
,
with
*NL*
a
yellowish
handle
.
It
's
strong
and
neat
,
so
I
ought
not
to
complain
,
*NL*
but
I
know
I
shall
feel
ashamed
of
it
beside
Annie
's
silk
one
with
a
*NL*
gold
top
,
''
sighed
Meg
,
surveying
the
little
umbrella
with
great
*NL*
disfavor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Change
it
,
''
advised
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
be
so
silly
,
or
hurt
Marmee
's
feelings
,
when
she
took
so
much
*NL*
pains
to
get
my
things
.
It
's
a
nonsensical
notion
of
mine
,
and
I
'm
not
*NL*
going
to
give
up
to
it
.
My
silk
stockings
and
two
pairs
of
new
gloves
*NL*
are
my
comfort
.
You
are
a
dear
,
to
lend
me
yours
,
Jo
.
I
feel
so
rich
,
*NL*
and
sort
of
elegant
,
with
two
new
pairs
,
and
the
old
ones
cleaned
up
for
*NL*
common
;
''
and
Meg
took
a
refreshing
peep
at
her
glove-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Annie
Moffat
has
blue
and
pink
bows
on
her
night-caps
;
would
you
put
*NL*
some
on
mine
?
''
she
asked
,
as
Beth
brought
up
a
pile
of
snowy
muslins
,
*NL*
fresh
from
Hannah
's
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
would
n't
;
for
the
smart
caps
wo
n't
match
the
plain
gowns
,
without
*NL*
any
trimming
on
them
.
Poor
folks
should
n't
rig
,
''
said
Jo
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
I
shall
_
ever
_
be
happy
enough
to
have
real
lace
on
my
*NL*
clothes
,
and
bows
on
my
caps
?
''
said
Meg
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
the
other
day
that
you
'd
be
perfectly
happy
if
you
could
only
*NL*
go
to
Annie
Moffat
's
,
''
observed
Beth
,
in
her
quiet
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
did
!
Well
,
I
_
am
_
happy
,
and
I
_
wo
n't
_
fret
;
but
it
does
seem
as
*NL*
if
the
more
one
gets
the
more
one
wants
,
does
n't
it
?
There
,
now
,
the
*NL*
trays
are
ready
,
and
everything
in
but
my
ball-dress
,
which
I
shall
*NL*
leave
for
mother
to
pack
,
''
said
Meg
,
cheering
up
,
as
she
glanced
from
*NL*
the
half-filled
trunk
to
the
many-times
pressed
and
mended
white
*NL*
tarlatan
,
which
she
called
her
``
ball-dress
,
''
with
an
important
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
was
fine
,
and
Meg
departed
,
in
style
,
for
a
fortnight
of
*NL*
novelty
and
pleasure
.
Mrs.
March
had
consented
to
the
visit
rather
*NL*
reluctantly
,
fearing
that
Margaret
would
come
back
more
discontented
*NL*
than
she
went
.
But
she
had
begged
so
hard
,
and
Sallie
had
promised
to
*NL*
take
good
care
of
her
,
and
a
little
pleasure
seemed
so
delightful
after
*NL*
a
winter
of
irksome
work
,
that
the
mother
yielded
,
and
the
daughter
went
*NL*
to
take
her
first
taste
of
fashionable
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Moffats
_
were
_
very
fashionable
,
and
simple
Meg
was
rather
daunted
,
*NL*
at
first
,
by
the
splendor
of
the
house
and
the
elegance
of
its
*NL*
occupants
.
But
they
were
kindly
people
,
in
spite
of
the
frivolous
life
*NL*
they
led
,
and
soon
put
their
guest
at
her
ease
.
Perhaps
Meg
felt
,
*NL*
without
understanding
why
,
that
they
were
not
particularly
cultivated
or
*NL*
intelligent
people
,
and
that
all
their
gilding
could
not
quite
conceal
*NL*
the
ordinary
material
of
which
they
were
made
.
It
certainly
was
*NL*
agreeable
to
fare
sumptuously
,
drive
in
a
fine
carriage
,
wear
her
best
*NL*
frock
every
day
,
and
do
nothing
but
enjoy
herself
.
It
suited
her
*NL*
exactly
;
and
soon
she
began
to
imitate
the
manners
and
conversation
of
*NL*
those
about
her
;
to
put
on
little
airs
and
graces
,
use
French
phrases
,
*NL*
crimp
her
hair
,
take
in
her
dresses
,
and
talk
about
the
fashions
as
well
*NL*
as
she
could
.
The
more
she
saw
of
Annie
Moffat
's
pretty
things
,
the
more
*NL*
she
envied
her
,
and
sighed
to
be
rich
.
Home
now
looked
bare
and
dismal
*NL*
as
she
thought
of
it
,
work
grew
harder
than
ever
,
and
she
felt
that
she
*NL*
was
a
very
destitute
and
much-injured
girl
,
in
spite
of
the
new
gloves
*NL*
and
silk
stockings
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
much
time
for
repining
,
however
,
for
the
three
young
girls
*NL*
were
busily
employed
in
``
having
a
good
time
.
''
They
shopped
,
walked
,
*NL*
rode
,
and
called
all
day
;
went
to
theatres
and
operas
,
or
frolicked
at
*NL*
home
in
the
evening
;
for
Annie
had
many
friends
,
and
knew
how
to
*NL*
entertain
them
.
Her
older
sisters
were
very
fine
young
ladies
,
and
one
*NL*
was
engaged
,
which
was
extremely
interesting
and
romantic
,
Meg
thought
.
*NL*
Mr.
Moffat
was
a
fat
,
jolly
old
gentleman
,
who
knew
her
father
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Moffat
,
a
fat
,
jolly
old
lady
,
who
took
as
great
a
fancy
to
Meg
as
her
*NL*
daughter
had
done
.
Every
one
petted
her
;
and
``
Daisy
,
''
as
they
called
*NL*
her
,
was
in
a
fair
way
to
have
her
head
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
evening
for
the
``
small
party
''
came
,
she
found
that
the
poplin
*NL*
would
n't
do
at
all
,
for
the
other
girls
were
putting
on
thin
dresses
,
*NL*
and
making
themselves
very
fine
indeed
;
so
out
came
the
tarlatan
,
*NL*
looking
older
,
limper
,
and
shabbier
than
ever
beside
Sallie
's
crisp
new
*NL*
one
.
Meg
saw
the
girls
glance
at
it
and
then
at
one
another
,
and
her
*NL*
cheeks
began
to
burn
,
for
,
with
all
her
gentleness
,
she
was
very
proud
.
*NL*
No
one
said
a
word
about
it
,
but
Sallie
offered
to
dress
her
hair
,
and
*NL*
Annie
to
tie
her
sash
,
and
Belle
,
the
engaged
sister
,
praised
her
white
*NL*
arms
;
but
in
their
kindness
Meg
saw
only
pity
for
her
poverty
,
and
her
*NL*
heart
felt
very
heavy
as
she
stood
by
herself
,
while
the
others
laughed
,
*NL*
chattered
,
and
flew
about
like
gauzy
butterflies
.
The
hard
,
bitter
*NL*
feeling
was
getting
pretty
bad
,
when
the
maid
brought
in
a
box
of
*NL*
flowers
.
Before
she
could
speak
,
Annie
had
the
cover
off
,
and
all
were
*NL*
exclaiming
at
the
lovely
roses
,
heath
,
and
fern
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
for
Belle
,
of
course
;
George
always
sends
her
some
,
but
these
are
*NL*
altogether
ravishing
,
''
cried
Annie
,
with
a
great
sniff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
for
Miss
March
,
the
man
said
.
And
here
's
a
note
,
''
put
in
the
*NL*
maid
,
holding
it
to
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fun
!
Who
are
they
from
?
Did
n't
know
you
had
a
lover
,
''
cried
the
*NL*
girls
,
fluttering
about
Meg
in
a
high
state
of
curiosity
and
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
note
is
from
mother
,
and
the
flowers
from
Laurie
,
''
said
Meg
simply
,
*NL*
yet
much
gratified
that
he
had
not
forgotten
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
indeed
!
''
said
Annie
,
with
a
funny
look
,
as
Meg
slipped
the
note
*NL*
into
her
pocket
,
as
a
sort
of
talisman
against
envy
,
vanity
,
and
false
*NL*
pride
;
for
the
few
loving
words
had
done
her
good
,
and
the
flowers
*NL*
cheered
her
up
by
their
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
almost
happy
again
,
she
laid
by
a
few
ferns
and
roses
for
*NL*
herself
,
and
quickly
made
up
the
rest
in
dainty
bouquets
for
the
*NL*
breasts
,
hair
,
or
skirts
of
her
friends
,
offering
them
so
prettily
that
*NL*
Clara
,
the
elder
sister
,
told
her
she
was
``
the
sweetest
little
thing
she
*NL*
ever
saw
;
''
and
they
looked
quite
charmed
with
her
small
attention
.
*NL*
Somehow
the
kind
act
finished
her
despondency
;
and
when
all
the
rest
*NL*
went
to
show
themselves
to
Mrs.
Moffat
,
she
saw
a
happy
,
bright-eyed
*NL*
face
in
the
mirror
,
as
she
laid
her
ferns
against
her
rippling
hair
,
and
*NL*
fastened
the
roses
in
the
dress
that
did
n't
strike
her
as
so
_
very
_
*NL*
shabby
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
enjoyed
herself
very
much
that
evening
,
for
she
danced
to
her
*NL*
heart
's
content
;
every
one
was
very
kind
,
and
she
had
three
compliments
.
*NL*
Annie
made
her
sing
,
and
some
one
said
she
had
a
remarkably
fine
voice
;
*NL*
Major
Lincoln
asked
who
``
the
fresh
little
girl
,
with
the
beautiful
*NL*
eyes
,
''
was
;
and
Mr.
Moffat
insisted
on
dancing
with
her
,
because
she
*NL*
``
did
n't
dawdle
,
but
had
some
spring
in
her
,
''
as
he
gracefully
expressed
*NL*
it
.
So
,
altogether
,
she
had
a
very
nice
time
,
till
she
overheard
a
bit
*NL*
of
a
conversation
,
which
disturbed
her
extremely
.
She
was
sitting
just
*NL*
inside
the
conservatory
,
waiting
for
her
partner
to
bring
her
an
ice
,
*NL*
when
she
heard
a
voice
ask
,
on
the
other
side
of
the
flowery
wall
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
old
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixteen
or

Here
Meg
's
partner
appeared
,
to
find
her
looking
much
flushed
and
rather
*NL*
agitated
.
She
_
was
_
proud
,
and
her
pride
was
useful
just
then
,
for
it
*NL*
helped
her
hide
her
mortification
,
anger
,
and
disgust
at
what
she
had
*NL*
just
heard
;
for
,
innocent
and
unsuspicious
as
she
was
,
she
could
not
*NL*
help
understanding
the
gossip
of
her
friends
.
She
tried
to
forget
it
,
*NL*
but
could
not
,
and
kept
repeating
to
herself
,
``
Mrs.
M.
has
made
her
*NL*
plans
,
''
``
that
fib
about
her
mamma
,
''
and
``
dowdy
tarlatan
,
''
till
she
was
*NL*
ready
to
cry
,
and
rush
home
to
tell
her
troubles
and
ask
for
advice
.
As
*NL*
that
was
impossible
,
she
did
her
best
to
seem
gay
;
and
,
being
rather
*NL*
excited
,
she
succeeded
so
well
that
no
one
dreamed
what
an
effort
she
*NL*
was
making
.
She
was
very
glad
when
it
was
all
over
,
and
she
was
quiet
in
*NL*
her
bed
,
where
she
could
think
and
wonder
and
fume
till
her
head
ached
*NL*
and
her
hot
cheeks
were
cooled
by
a
few
natural
tears
.
Those
foolish
,
*NL*
yet
well-meant
words
,
had
opened
a
new
world
to
Meg
,
and
much
disturbed
*NL*
the
peace
of
the
old
one
,
in
which
,
till
now
,
she
had
lived
as
happily
*NL*
as
a
child
.
Her
innocent
friendship
with
Laurie
was
spoilt
by
the
silly
*NL*
speeches
she
had
overheard
;
her
faith
in
her
mother
was
a
little
shaken
*NL*
by
the
worldly
plans
attributed
to
her
by
Mrs.
Moffat
,
who
judged
others
*NL*
by
herself
;
and
the
sensible
resolution
to
be
contented
with
the
simple
*NL*
wardrobe
which
suited
a
poor
man
's
daughter
,
was
weakened
by
the
*NL*
unnecessary
pity
of
girls
who
thought
a
shabby
dress
one
of
the
greatest
*NL*
calamities
under
heaven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Meg
had
a
restless
night
,
and
got
up
heavy-eyed
,
unhappy
,
half
*NL*
resentful
toward
her
friends
,
and
half
ashamed
of
herself
for
not
*NL*
speaking
out
frankly
,
and
setting
everything
right
.
Everybody
dawdled
*NL*
that
morning
,
and
it
was
noon
before
the
girls
found
energy
enough
even
*NL*
to
take
up
their
worsted
work
.
Something
in
the
manner
of
her
friends
*NL*
struck
Meg
at
once
;
they
treated
her
with
more
respect
,
she
thought
;
*NL*
took
quite
a
tender
interest
in
what
she
said
,
and
looked
at
her
with
*NL*
eyes
that
plainly
betrayed
curiosity
.
All
this
surprised
and
flattered
*NL*
her
,
though
she
did
not
understand
it
till
Miss
Belle
looked
up
from
her
*NL*
writing
,
and
said
,
with
a
sentimental
air
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daisy
,
dear
,
I
've
sent
an
invitation
to
your
friend
,
Mr.
Laurence
,
for
*NL*
Thursday

We
should
like
to
know
him
,
and
it
's
only
a
proper
compliment
*NL*
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
colored
,
but
a
mischievous
fancy
to
tease
the
girls
made
her
reply
*NL*
demurely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind

but
I
'm
afraid
he
wo
n't
come

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not

asked
Miss

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
too
old

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

do
you

What
is
his
age

cried
Miss
*NL*
Clara
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearly
seventy

I
believe

answered
Meg
,
counting
stitches
,
to
hide
*NL*
the
merriment
in
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sly
creature
!
Of
course
we
meant
the
young
man

exclaimed
Miss
*NL*
Belle
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
n't
any
;
Laurie
is
only
a
little
boy
,
''
and
Meg
laughed
also
at
*NL*
the
queer
look
which
the
sisters
exchanged
as
she
thus
described
her
*NL*
supposed
lover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
your
age

''
Nan
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nearer
my
sister
Jo
's
;
_
I
_
am
seventeen
in
August

''
returned
Meg
,
*NL*
tossing
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
nice
of
him
to
send
you
flowers
,
is
n't
it
?

said
Annie
,
*NL*
looking
wise
about
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
often
does
,
to
all
of
us
;
for
their
house
is
full
,
and
we
are
*NL*
so
fond
of
them
.
My
mother
and
old
Mr.
Laurence
are
friends
,
you
know
,
*NL*
so
it
is
quite
natural
that
we
children
should
play
together
;

and
Meg
*NL*
hoped
they
would
say
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
evident
Daisy
is
n't
out
yet

said
Miss
Clara
to
Belle
,
with
a
*NL*
nod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
a
pastoral
state
of
innocence
all
round

returned
Miss
Belle
,
*NL*
with
a
shrug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
out
to
get
some
little
matters

I

asked
Mrs.

lumbering
in
,
like

an
elephant

in
silk

lace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

Sallie
.
``

n't
want
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I

''
began
Meg
,
but
stopped
,
because
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
*NL*
_
did
_
want
several
things
,
and
could
not
have
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
you
wear
?
''
asked
Sallie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
old
white
one
again

if
I
can
mend
it
fit
to
be
seen

it
got
sadly
*NL*
torn
last
night
,
''
said
Meg
,
trying
to
speak
quite
easily
,
but
feeling
*NL*
very
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
send
home
for
another
?
''
said
Sallie
,
who
was
not
an
*NL*
observing
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
got
any
other
.
''
It
cost
Meg
an
effort
to
say
that
,
but
Sallie
*NL*
did
not
see
it
,
and
exclaimed
,
in
amiable
surprise
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
that
?
How
funny
--
''
She
did
not
finish
her
speech
,
for
Belle
shook
*NL*
her
head
at
her
,
and
broke
in
,
saying
kindly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
;
where
is
the
use
of
having
a
lot
of
dresses

out
?
There
's
no
need
of
sending
home

Daisy
,
even
if
you
had
a
dozen
,
*NL*
for
I
've
got
a
sweet
blue
silk
laid
away

which
I

outgrown

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind

I
do
n't
mind

do

does
*NL*
well
enough
for
a
little
girl
like

said
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
let

please
myself
by
dressing
you
up
in
style

I
admire
to

be
a
regular
little
beauty

with
a
touch
here
and
there

I
*NL*
sha
'n'
t
let
any
one
see
you
till
you
are
done
,
and
then
we
'll
burst
upon
*NL*
them
like
Cinderella
and
her
godmother
,
going
to
the
ball

''
said
Belle
,
*NL*
in
her
persuasive
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
could
n't
refuse
the
offer
so
kindly
made
,
for
a
desire
to
see
if
she
*NL*
would
be
``
a
little
beauty
''
after
touching
up
,
caused
her
to
accept
,
and
*NL*
forget
all
her
former
uncomfortable
feelings
towards
the
Moffats
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
Thursday
evening
,
Belle
shut
herself
up
with
her
maid
;
and
,
*NL*
between
them
,
they
turned
Meg
into
a
fine
lady
.
They
crimped
and
curled
*NL*
her
hair
,
they
polished
her
neck
and
arms
with
some
fragrant
powder
,
*NL*
touched
her
lips
with
coralline
salve
,
to
make
them
redder
,
and
Hortense
*NL*
would
have
added
``
a
_
soupcon
_
of
rouge
,
''
if
Meg
had
not
rebelled
.
They
*NL*
laced
her
into
a
sky-blue
dress
,
which
was
so
tight
she
could
hardly
*NL*
breathe
,
and
so
low
in
the
neck
that
modest
Meg
blushed
at
herself
in
*NL*
the
mirror
.
A
set
of
silver
filagree
was
added
,
bracelets
,
necklace
,
*NL*
brooch
,
and
even
ear-rings
,
for
Hortense
tied
them
on
,
with
a
bit
of
*NL*
pink
silk
,
which
did
not
show
.
A
cluster
of
tea-rosebuds
at
the
bosom
,
*NL*
and
a
_
ruche
_
,
reconciled
Meg
to
the
display
of
her
pretty
white
*NL*
shoulders
,
and
a
pair
of
high-heeled
blue
silk
boots
satisfied
the
last
*NL*
wish
of
her
heart
.
A
laced
handkerchief
,
a
plumy
fan
,
and
a
bouquet
in
a
*NL*
silver
holder
finished
her
off
;
and
Miss
Belle
surveyed
her
with
the
*NL*
satisfaction
of
a
little
girl
with
a
newly
dressed
doll
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mademoiselle
is
charmante
,
tres
jolie
,
is
she
not
?
''
cried
Hortense
,
*NL*
clasping
her
hands
in
an
affected
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
show
yourself
,
''
said
Miss
Belle
,
leading
the
way
to
the
room
*NL*
where
the
others
were
waiting
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Meg
went
rustling
after
,
with
her
long
skirts
trailing
,
her
ear-rings
*NL*
tinkling
,
her
curls
waving
,
and
her
heart
beating
,
she
felt
as
if
her
*NL*
``
fun
''
had
really
begun
at
last
,
for
the
mirror
had
plainly
told
her
that
*NL*
she
_
was
_
``
a
little
beauty
.
''
Her
friends
repeated
the
pleasing
phrase
*NL*
enthusiastically
;
and
,
for
several
minutes
,
she
stood
,
like
the
jackdaw
*NL*
in
the
fable
,
enjoying
her
borrowed
plumes
,
while
the
rest
chattered
*NL*
like
a
party
of
magpies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
I
dress
,
do
you
drill
her

,
in
the
management
of
her
skirt

*NL*
and
those
French
heels
,
or
she
will
trip
herself
up
.
Take
your
silver
*NL*
butterfly
,
and
catch
up
that
long
curl
on
the
left
side
of
her
head

Clara
,
and
do
n't
any
of
you
disturb
the
charming
work
of
my
hands

said
*NL*
Belle
,
as
she
hurried
away
,
looking
well
pleased
with
her
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
to
go
down
,
I
feel
so
queer
and
stiff
and
half-dressed
,

*NL*
said
Meg
to
Sallie
,
as
the
bell
rang
,
and
Mrs.
Moffat
sent
to
ask
the
*NL*
young
ladies
to
appear
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
a
bit
like
yourself

but
you
are
very
nice

I
'm
nowhere

beside
you
,
for
Belle
has
heaps
of
taste
,
and
you
're
quite
French

I
*NL*
assure
you

Let
your
flowers
hang

do
n't
be
so
careful
of
them

and
be
*NL*
sure
you
do
n't
trip

returned
Sallie
,
trying
not
to
care
that
Meg
was
*NL*
prettier
than
herself
.

Keeping
that
warning
carefully
in
mind
,
Margaret
got
safely
down
stairs
,
*NL*
and
sailed
into
the
drawing-rooms
,
where
the
Moffats
and
a
few
early
*NL*
guests
were
assembled
.
She
very
soon
discovered
that
there
is
a
charm
*NL*
about
fine
clothes
which
attracts
a
certain
class
of
people
,
and
secures
*NL*
their
respect
.
Several
young
ladies
,
who
had
taken
no
notice
of
her
*NL*
before
,
were
very
affectionate
all
of
a
sudden
;
several
young
gentlemen
,
*NL*
who
had
only
stared
at
her
at
the
other
party
,
now
not
only
stared
,
but
*NL*
asked
to
be
introduced
,
and
said
all
manner
of
foolish
but
agreeable
*NL*
things
to
her
;
and
several
old
ladies
,
who
sat
on
sofas
,
and
criticised
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
party
,
inquired
who
she
was
,
with
an
air
of
interest
.
*NL*
She
heard
Mrs.
Moffat
reply
to
one
of
them
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Daisy

said
the

putting
up
her
glass
for
another

observation
of
Meg

who
tried
to
look

did
not
pass
away
,
but
she
imagined
herself
acting
*NL*
the
new
part
of
fine
lady
,
and
so
got
on
pretty
well
,
though
the
tight
*NL*
dress
gave
her
a
side-ache
,
the
train
kept
getting
under
her
feet
,
and
*NL*
she
was
in
constant
fear
lest
her
ear-rings
should
fly
off
,
and
get
lost
*NL*
or
broken
.
She
was
flirting
her
fan
and
laughing
at
the
feeble
jokes
of
*NL*
a
young
gentleman
who
tried
to
be
witty
,
when
she
suddenly
stopped
*NL*
laughing
and
looked
confused
;
for
,
just
opposite
,
she
saw
Laurie
.
He
was
*NL*
staring
at
her
with
undisguised
surprise
,
and
disapproval
also
,
she
*NL*
thought
;
for
,
though
he
bowed
and
smiled
,
yet
something
in
his
honest
*NL*
eyes
made
her
blush
,
and
wish
she
had
her
old
dress
on
.
To
complete
her
*NL*
confusion
,
she
saw
Belle
nudge
Annie
,
and
both
glance
from
her
to
*NL*
Laurie
,
who
,
she
was
happy
to
see
,
looked
unusually
boyish
and
shy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silly
creatures
,
to
put
such
thoughts
into
my
head
!
I
wo
n't
care
for
*NL*
it
,
or
let
it
change
me
a
bit
,
''
thought
Meg
,
and
rustled
across
the
room
*NL*
to
shake
hands
with
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you
came
,
I
was
afraid
you
would
n't
,
''
she
said
,
with
her
most
*NL*
grown-up
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
wanted
me
to
come
,
and
tell
her
how
you
looked
,
so
I
did
;
''
answered
*NL*
Laurie
,
without
turning
his
eyes
upon
her
,
though
he
half
smiled
at
her
*NL*
maternal
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
you
tell
her
?
''
asked
Meg
,
full
of
curiosity
to
know
his
*NL*
opinion
of
her
,
yet
feeling
ill
at
ease
with
him
,
for
the
first
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
say
I
did
n't
know
you
;
for
you
look
so
grown-up
,
and
unlike
*NL*
yourself
,
I
'm
quite
afraid
of
you
,
''
he
said
,
fumbling
at
his
*NL*
glove-button
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
absurd
of
you
!
The
girls
dressed
me
up
for
fun
,
and
I
rather
like
*NL*
it
.
Would
n't
Jo
stare
if
she
saw
me
?
''
said
Meg
,
bent
on
making
him
say
*NL*
whether
he
thought
her
improved
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
she
would
,
''
returned
Laurie
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
me
so
?
''
asked
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
was
the
blunt
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
in
an
anxious
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
glanced
at
her
frizzled
head
,
bare
shoulders
,
and
fantastically
*NL*
trimmed
dress
,
with
an
expression
that
abashed
her
more
than
his
answer
,
*NL*
which
had
not
a
particle
of
his
usual
politeness
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
fuss
and
feathers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
altogether
too
much
from
a
lad
younger
than
herself
;
and
Meg
*NL*
walked
away
,
saying
petulantly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
the
rudest
boy
I
ever
saw
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
very
much
ruffled
,
she
went
and
stood
at
a
quiet
window
,
to
cool
*NL*
her
cheeks
,
for
the
tight
dress
gave
her
an
uncomfortably
brilliant
*NL*
color
.
As
she
stood
there
,
Major
Lincoln
passed
by
;
and
,
a
minute
after
,
*NL*
she
heard
him
saying
to
his
mother
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
making
a
fool
of
that
little
girl
;
I
wanted
you
to
see
her
,
*NL*
but
they
have
spoilt
her
entirely
;
she
's
nothing
but
a
doll
,
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
!
''
sighed
Meg
;
``
I
wish
I
'd
been
sensible
,
and
worn
my
own
*NL*
things
;
then
I
should
not
have
disgusted
other
people
,
or
felt
so
*NL*
uncomfortable
and
ashamed
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
leaned
her
forehead
on
the
cool
pane
,
and
stood
half
hidden
by
the
*NL*
curtains
,
never
minding
that
her
favorite
waltz
had
begun
,
till
some
one
*NL*
touched
her
;
and
,
turning
,
she
saw
Laurie
,
looking
penitent
,
as
he
said
,
*NL*
with
his
very
best
bow
,
and
his
hand
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
forgive
my
rudeness
,
and
come
and
dance
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
will
be
too
disagreeable
to
you
,
''
said
Meg
,
trying
to
*NL*
look
offended
,
and
failing
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
of
it
;
I
'm
dying
to
do
it
.
Come
,
I
'll
be
good
;
I
do
n't
like
*NL*
your
gown
,
but
I
do
think
you
are
--
just
splendid
;
''
and
he
waved
his
*NL*
hands
,
as
if
words
failed
to
express
his
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
smiled
and
relented
,
and
whispered
,
as
they
stood
waiting
to
catch
*NL*
the
time
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
care
my
skirt
do
n't
trip
you
up
;
it
's
the
plague
of
my
life
,
and
I
*NL*
was
a
goose
to
wear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pin
it
round
your
neck
,
and
then
it
will
be
useful
,
''
said
Laurie
,
*NL*
looking
down
at
the
little
blue
boots
,
which
he
evidently
approved
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
Away
they
went
,
fleetly
and
gracefully
;
for
,
having
practised
at
home
,
*NL*
they
were
well
matched
,
and
the
blithe
young
couple
were
a
pleasant
*NL*
sight
to
see
,
as
they
twirled
merrily
round
and
round
,
feeling
more
*NL*
friendly
than
ever
after
their
small
tiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laurie
,
I
want
you
to
do
me
a
favor
;
will
you
?
''
said
Meg
,
as
he
stood
*NL*
fanning
her
,
when
her
breath
gave
out
,
which
it
did
very
soon
,
though
*NL*
she
would
not
own
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
I
!
''
said
Laurie
,
with
alacrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
tell
them
at
home
about
my
dress
to-night
.
They
wo
n't
*NL*
understand
the
joke
,
and
it
will
worry
mother
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
did
you
do
it
?
''
said
Laurie
's
eyes
,
so
plainly
that
Meg
*NL*
hastily
added
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
tell
them
,
myself
,
all
about
it
,
and
''
fess
'
to
mother
how
*NL*
silly
I
've
been
.
But
I
'd
rather
do
it
myself
;
so
you
'll
not
tell
,
will
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
give
you
my
word
I
wo
n't
;
only
what
shall
I
say
when
they
ask
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
say
I
looked
pretty
well
,
and
was
having
a
good
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
say
the
first
,
with
all
my
heart
;
but
how
about
the
other
?
You
*NL*
do
n't
look
as
if
you
were
having
a
good
time
;
are
you
?
''
and
Laurie
*NL*
looked
at
her
with
an
expression
which
made
her
answer
,
in
a
whisper
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
just
now
.
Do
n't
think
I
'm
horrid
;
I
only
wanted
a
little
fun
,
*NL*
but
this
sort
does
n't
pay
,
I
find
,
and
I
'm
getting
tired
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
comes
Ned
Moffat
;
what
does
he
want
?
''
said
Laurie
,
knitting
his
*NL*
black
brows
,
as
if
he
did
not
regard
his
young
host
in
the
light
of
a
*NL*
pleasant
addition
to
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
put
his
name
down
for
three
dances
,
and
I
suppose
he
's
coming
for
*NL*
them
.
What
a
bore
!
''
said
Meg
,
assuming
a
languid
air
,
which
amused
*NL*
Laurie
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
speak
to
her
again
till
supper-time
,
when
he
saw
her
drinking
*NL*
champagne
with
Ned
and
his
friend
Fisher
,
who
were
behaving
``
like
a
pair
*NL*
of
fools
,
''
as
Laurie
said
to
himself
,
for
he
felt
a
brotherly
sort
of
*NL*
right
to
watch
over
the
Marches
,
and
fight
their
battles
whenever
a
*NL*
defender
was
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
I
would
n't
,
Meg
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
have
a
splitting
headache
to-morrow
,
if
you
drink
much
of
that
.
*NL*
I
would
n't
Meg
;
your
mother
does
n't
like
it
,
you
know
,
''
he
whispered
,
*NL*
leaning
over
her
chair
,
as
Ned
turned
to
refill
her
glass
,
and
Fisher
*NL*
stooped
to
pick
up
her
fan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
Meg
,
to-night
;
I
'm
'
a
doll
,
'
who
does
all
sorts
of
crazy
*NL*
things
.
To-morrow
I
shall
put
away
my
`
fuss
and
feathers
,
'
and
be
*NL*
desperately
good
again
,
''
she
answered
,
with
an
affected
little
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
to-morrow
was
here
,
then
,
''
muttered
Laurie
,
walking
off
,
*NL*
ill-pleased
at
the
change
he
saw
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
danced
and
flirted
,
chattered
and
giggled
,
as
the
other
girls
did
;
*NL*
after
supper
she
undertook
the
German
,
and
blundered
through
it
,
nearly
*NL*
upsetting
her
partner
with
her
long
skirt
,
and
romping
in
a
way
that
*NL*
scandalized
Laurie
,
who
looked
on
and
meditated
a
lecture
.
But
he
got
no
*NL*
chance
to
deliver
it
,
for
Meg
kept
away
from
him
till
he
came
to
say
*NL*
good-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Remember
!
''
she
said
,
trying
to
smile
,
for
the
splitting
headache
had
*NL*
already
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence
a
la
mort
,
''
replied
Laurie
,
with
a
melodramatic
flourish
,
as
he
*NL*
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
little
bit
of
by-play
excited
Annie
's
curiosity
;
but
Meg
was
too
*NL*
tired
for
gossip
,
and
went
to
bed
,
feeling
as
if
she
had
been
to
a
*NL*
masquerade
,
and
had
n't
enjoyed
herself
as
much
as
she
expected
.
She
was
*NL*
sick
all
the
next
day
,
and
on
Saturday
went
home
,
quite
used
up
with
her
*NL*
fortnight
's
fun
,
and
feeling
that
she
had
``
sat
in
the
lap
of
luxury
''
*NL*
long
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
seem
pleasant
to
be
quiet
,
and
not
have
company
manners
on
all
*NL*
the
time
.
Home
_
is
_
a
nice
place
,
though
it
is
n't
splendid
,
''
said
Meg
,
*NL*
looking
about
her
with
a
restful
expression
,
as
she
sat
with
her
mother
*NL*
and
Jo
on
the
Sunday
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
to
hear
you
say
so
,
dear
,
for
I
was
afraid
home
would
seem
*NL*
dull
and
poor
to
you
,
after
your
fine
quarters
,
''
replied
her
mother
,
who
*NL*
had
given
her
many
anxious
looks
that
day
;
for
motherly
eyes
are
quick
*NL*
to
see
any
change
in
children
's
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
had
told
her
adventures
gayly
,
and
said
over
and
over
what
a
*NL*
charming
time
she
had
had
;
but
something
still
seemed
to
weigh
upon
her
*NL*
spirits
,
and
,
when
the
younger
girls
were
gone
to
bed
,
she
sat
*NL*
thoughtfully
staring
at
the
fire
,
saying
little
,
and
looking
worried
.
As
*NL*
the
clock
struck
nine
,
and
Jo
proposed
bed
,
Meg
suddenly
left
her
chair
,
*NL*
and
,
taking
Beth
's
stool
,
leaned
her
elbows
on
her
mother
's
knee
,
saying
*NL*
bravely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marmee
,
I
want
to
''
fess
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
;
what
is
it
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
go
away
?
''
asked
Jo
discreetly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
;
do
n't
I
always
tell
you
everything
?
I
was
ashamed
to
*NL*
speak
of
it
before
the
children
,
but
I
want
you
to
know
all
the
dreadful
*NL*
things
I
did
at
the
Moffat
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
prepared
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
smiling
,
but
looking
a
little
*NL*
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
they
dressed
me
up
,
but
I
did
n't
tell
you
that
they
powdered
*NL*
and
squeezed
and
frizzled
,
and
made
me
look
like
a
fashion-plate
.
Laurie
*NL*
thought
I
was
n't
proper
;
I
know
he
did
,
though
he
did
n't
say
so
,
and
one
*NL*
man
called
me
'
a
doll
.
'
I
knew
it
was
silly
,
but
they
flattered
me
,
and
*NL*
said
I
was
a
beauty
,
and
quantities
of
nonsense
,
so
I
let
them
make
a
*NL*
fool
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
''
asked
Jo
,
as
Mrs.
March
looked
silently
at
the
downcast
*NL*
face
of
her
pretty
daughter
,
and
could
not
find
it
in
her
heart
to
blame
*NL*
her
little
follies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
drank
champagne
and
romped
and
tried
to
flirt
,
and
was
altogether
*NL*
abominable
,
''
said
Meg
self-reproachfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
something
more
,
I
think
;
''
and
Mrs.
March
smoothed
the
soft
*NL*
cheek
,
which
suddenly
grew
rosy
,
as
Meg
answered
slowly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
's
very
silly
,
but
I
want
to
tell
it
,
because
I
hate
to
have
*NL*
people
say
and
think
such
things
about
us
and
Laurie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
told
the
various
bits
of
gossip
she
had
heard
at
the
Moffats
;
*NL*
and
,
as
she
spoke
,
Jo
saw
her
mother
fold
her
lips
tightly
,
as
if
ill
*NL*
pleased
that
such
ideas
should
be
put
into
Meg
's
innocent
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
if
that
is
n't
the
greatest
rubbish
I
ever
heard
,
''
cried
Jo
*NL*
indignantly
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
pop
out
and
tell
them
so
,
on
the
spot
?

laughed

as

looking
distressed

*NL*
``

Mrs.

gravely
.

little

I
dare
say
,
but
worldly
,
*NL*
ill-bred
,
and
full
of
these
vulgar
ideas
about
young
people
.
I
am
more
*NL*
sorry
than
I
can
express
for
the
mischief
this
visit
may
have
done
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

I
'll
forget
all

*NL*
remember
only
the
good
;
for
I
did
enjoy
a
great

thank

much

said
Meg
,
looking
half
ashamed
of
the
*NL*
confession
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
perfectly
natural

quite
harmless

if
the
liking

not

become
a
passion

one
to
do
foolish
or
unmaidenly
things

Learn
*NL*
to
know
and
value
the
praise
which
is
worth
having

excite
the

admiration

*NL*
*NL*
Margaret
sat
thinking
a
moment
,
while
Jo
stood
with
her
hands
behind
*NL*
her
,
looking
both
interested
and
a
little
perplexed
;
for
it
was
a
new
*NL*
thing
to
see
Meg
blushing
and
talking
about
admiration
,
lovers
,
and
*NL*
things
of
that
sort
;
and
Jo
felt
as
if
,
during
that
fortnight
,
her
*NL*
sister
had
grown
up
amazingly
,
and
was
drifting
away
from
her
into
a
*NL*
world
where
she
could
not
follow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother

do
you
have

Mrs.

said
?

asked
Meg
bashfully

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

my

I
have
a
great
many

all
mothers
do

mine
differ
*NL*
somewhat
from
Mrs.
Moffat

,
I
suspect
.
I
will
tell
you
some
of
them
,
*NL*
for
the
time
has
come
when
a
word
may
set
this
romantic
little
head

heart
of
yours
right
,
on
a
very
serious
subject
.
You
are
young
,
Meg
,
but
*NL*
not
too
young
to
understand
me
;
and
mothers

lips
are
the
fittest
to

speak
of
such
things
to

you

Jo

your

come

listen
to

me
carry
them
out

are
good

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
went
and
sat
on
one
arm
of
the
chair
,
looking
as
if
she
thought
they
*NL*
were
about
to
join
in
some
very
solemn
affair

Holding
a
hand
of
each
,
*NL*
and
watching
the
two
young

wistfully

serious

It

ambitious

not

merely
because

are
rich

have
splendid

Do

As
spring
came
on
,
a
new
set
of
amusements
became
the
fashion
,
and
the
*NL*
lengthening
days
gave
long
afternoons
for
work
and
play
of
all
sorts
.
*NL*
The
garden
had
to
be
put
in
order
,
and
each
sister
had
a
quarter
of
the
*NL*
little
plot
to
do
what
she
liked
with
.
Hannah
used
to
say
,
``
I
'd
know
*NL*
which
each
of

gardings
belonged
to

ef
I
see

and
so
*NL*
she
might
,
for
the
girls
'
tastes
differed
as
much
as
their
characters
.
*NL*
Meg
's
had
roses
and
heliotrope
,
myrtle
,
and
a
little
orange-tree
in
it
.
*NL*
Jo
's
bed
was
never
alike
two
seasons
,
for
she
was
always
trying
*NL*
experiments
;
this
year
it
was
to
be
a
plantation
of
sun-flowers
,
the
*NL*
seeds
of
which
cheerful
and
aspiring
plant
were
to
feed
``
Aunt
*NL*
Cockle-top
''
and
her
family
of
chicks
.
Beth
had
old-fashioned
,
fragrant
*NL*
flowers
in
her
garden
,
--
sweet
peas
and
mignonette
,
larkspur
,
pinks
,
*NL*
pansies
,
and
southernwood
,
with
chickweed
for
the
bird
,
and
catnip
for
*NL*
the
pussies
.
Amy
had
a
bower
in
hers
,
--
rather
small
and
earwiggy
,
but
*NL*
very
pretty
to
look
at
,
--
with
honeysuckles
and
morning-glories
hanging
*NL*
their
colored
horns
and
bells
in
graceful
wreaths
all
over
it
;
tall
,
*NL*
white
lilies
,
delicate
ferns
,
and
as
many
brilliant
,
picturesque
plants
*NL*
as
would
consent
to
blossom
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gardening
,
walks
,
rows
on
the
river
,
and
flower-hunts
employed
the
fine
*NL*
days
;
and
for
rainy
ones
,
they
had
house
diversions
,
--
some
old
,
some
*NL*
new
,
--
all
more
or
less
original
.
One
of
these
was
the
``
P.
C.
''
;
for
,
as
*NL*
secret
societies
were
the
fashion
,
it
was
thought
proper
to
have
one
;
*NL*
and
,
as
all
of
the
girls
admired
Dickens
,
they
called
themselves
the
*NL*
Pickwick
Club
.
With
a
few
interruptions
,
they
had
kept
this
up
for
a
*NL*
year
,
and
met
every
Saturday
evening
in
the
big
garret
,
on
which
*NL*
occasions
the
ceremonies
were
as
follows
:
Three
chairs
were
arranged
in
*NL*
a
row
before
a
table
,
on
which
was
a
lamp
,
also
four
white
badges
,
with
*NL*
a
big
``
P.
C.
''
in
different
colors
on
each
,
and
the
weekly
newspaper
,
*NL*
called
``
The
Pickwick
Portfolio
,
''
to
which
all
contributed
something
;
*NL*
while
Jo
,
who
revelled
in
pens
and
ink
,
was
the
editor
.
At
seven
*NL*
o'clock
,
the
four
members
ascended
to
the
club-room
,
tied
their
badges
*NL*
round
their
heads
,
and
took
their
seats
with
great
solemnity
.
Meg
,
as
*NL*
the
eldest
,
was
Samuel

;
Jo
,
being
of
a
literary

,
Augustus

Tracy

though
*NL*
her
stern
father
bestows
her
hand
,
''
returned
the
troubadour
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
whispered
that
she
loves
the
young
English
artist
who
*NL*
haunts
her
steps
,
and
is
spurned
by
the
old
count
,
''
said
the
*NL*
lady
,
as
they
joined
the
dance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
revel
was
at
its
height
when
a
priest
appeared
,
and
,
*NL*
withdrawing
the
young
pair
to
an
alcove
hung
with
purple
velvet
,
*NL*
he
motioned
them
to
kneel
.
Instant
silence
fell
upon
the
gay
*NL*
throng
;
and
not
a
sound
,
but
the
dash
of
fountains
or
the
rustle
*NL*
of
orange-groves
sleeping
in
the
moonlight
,
broke
the
hush
,
as
*NL*
Count
de
Adelon
spoke
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lords
and
ladies
,
pardon
the
ruse
by
which
I
have
gathered
*NL*
you
here
to
witness
the
marriage
of
my
daughter
.
Father
,
we
wait
*NL*
your
services
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
eyes
turned
toward
the
bridal
party
,
and
a
low
murmur
of
*NL*
amazement
went
through
the
throng
,
for
neither
bride
nor
groom
*NL*
removed
their
masks
.
Curiosity
and
wonder
possessed
all
hearts
,
*NL*
but
respect
restrained
all
tongues
till
the
holy
rite
was
over
.
*NL*
Then
the
eager
spectators
gathered
round
the
count
,
demanding
an
*NL*
explanation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gladly
would
I
give
it
if
I
could
;
but
I
only
know
that
it
was
*NL*
the
whim
of
my
timid
Viola
,
and
I
yielded
to
it
.
Now
,
my
*NL*
children
,
let
the
play
end
.
Unmask
,
and
receive
my
blessing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
neither
bent
the
knee
;
for
the
young
bridegroom
replied
,
in
*NL*
a
tone
that
startled
all
listeners
,
as
the
mask
fell
,
disclosing
*NL*
the
noble
face
of
Ferdinand
Devereux
,
the
artist
lover
;
and
,
*NL*
leaning
on
the
breast
where
now
flashed
the
star
of
an
English
*NL*
earl
,
was
the
lovely
Viola
,
radiant
with
joy
and
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lord
,
you
scornfully
bade
me
claim
your
daughter
when
I
*NL*
could
boast
as
high
a
name
and
vast
a
fortune
as
the
Count
*NL*
Antonio
.
I
can
do
more
;
for
even
your
ambitious
soul
can
not
*NL*
refuse
the
Earl
of
Devereux
and
De
Vere
,
when
he
gives
his
*NL*
ancient
name
and
boundless
wealth
in
return
for
the
beloved
hand
*NL*
of
this
fair
lady
,
now
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
count
stood
like
one
changed
to
stone
;
and
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
bewildered
crowd
,
Ferdinand
added
,
with
a
gay
smile
of
triumph
,
*NL*
``
To
you
,
my
gallant
friends
,
I
can
only
wish
that
your
wooing
*NL*
may
prosper
as
mine
has
done
;

you
may
all
win

by

THE
HISTORY
OF
A
SQUASH
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
upon
a
time
a
farmer
planted
a
little
seed
in
his
garden
,
*NL*
and
after
a
while
it
sprouted
and
became
a
vine
,
and
bore
many
*NL*
squashes
.
One
day
in
October
,
when
they
were
ripe
,
he
picked
one
*NL*
and
took
it
to
market
.
A
grocer-man
bought
and
put
it
in
his
*NL*
shop
.
That
same
morning
,
a
little
girl
,
in
a
brown
hat
and
blue
*NL*
dress
,
with
a
round
face
and
snub
nose
,
went
and
bought
it
for
*NL*
her
mother
.
She
lugged
it
home
,
cut
it
up
,
and
boiled
it
in
the
*NL*
big
pot
;
mashed
some
of
it
,
with
salt
and
butter
,
for
dinner
;
*NL*
and
to
the
rest
she
added
a
pint
of
milk
,
two
eggs
,
four
spoons
*NL*
of
sugar
,
nutmeg
,
and
some
crackers
;
put
it
in
a
deep
dish
,
and
*NL*
baked
it
till
it
was
brown
and
nice
;
and
next
day
it
was
eaten
*NL*
by
a
family

the

I

is
a

I
hope
you
*NL*
will
pardon
his
badness
and
let
him
send
a

because
*NL*
he
ca
n't
write
out
of

as
he
has
so
many
lessons
to
do
*NL*
and
no

in

I
will
try

take
time
by

prepare
some

which
will

A
SAD
ACCIDENT
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Friday
last
,
we
were
startled
by
a
violent
shock
in
our
*NL*
basement
,
followed
by
cries
of
distress
.
On
rushing
,
in
a
body
,
*NL*
to
the
cellar
,
we
discovered
our
beloved
President
prostrate
*NL*
upon
the
floor
,
having
tripped
and
fallen
while
getting
wood
for
*NL*
domestic
purposes
.
A
perfect
scene
of
ruin
met
our
eyes
;
for
in
*NL*
his
fall
Mr.
Pickwick
had
plunged
his
head
and
shoulders
into
a
*NL*
tub
of
water
,
upset
a
keg
of
soft
soap
upon
his
manly
form
,
and
*NL*
torn
his
garments
badly
.
On
being
removed
from
this
perilous
*NL*
situation
,
it
was
discovered
that
he
had
suffered
no
injury
but
*NL*
several
bruises
;
and
,
we
are
happy
to
add
,
is
now
doing
well

tie
a

Jo

sudden
change

tone
made
the

laugh
;
but
all
looked
rather
*NL*
anxious

and
no

said

as
Snodgrass
took

``

A
loud
response
from

followed

to
everybody

surprise

by
a

timid
one
from
Beth

``

Meg

were
contrary

rose
to
say

with
great

``

observed
Pickwick

pulling
the
little
curl
on

forehead

as
she
*NL*
always
did
when
doubtful

*NL*
Up
rose
Snodgrass

very
much
in

``
Sir

I
give
you
my
word

Laurie
wo
n't
do
anything
of

He
likes
to
write
,
and
*NL*
he
'll
give
a
tone
to
our
contributions
,
and
keep
us
from
being
*NL*
sentimental
,
do
n't
you
see
?
We
can
do
so
little
for
him
,
and
he
does
so
*NL*
much
for
us
,
I
think
the
least
we
can
do
is
to
offer
him
a
place
here
,
*NL*
and
make
him
welcome
if
he
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
artful
allusion
to
benefits
conferred
brought
Tupman
to
his
feet
,
*NL*
looking
as
if
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
ought
to
do
it
,
even
if
we
_
are

afraid
.
I
say
he
_
may
_
come
,
*NL*
and
his
grandpa
,
too
,
if
he
likes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
spirited
burst
from
Beth
electrified
the
club
,
and
Jo
left
her
*NL*
seat
to
shake
hands
approvingly
.
``
Now
then

vote
again

Everybody
*NL*
remember
it
's

cried
Snodgrass

replied
three
voices
at

*NL*
*NL*
``

Now

as
Winkle
characteristically
observes

allow

to
present
*NL*
the

and
,
to
the
dismay
of
the
rest
of
the

,
Jo
threw
*NL*
open
the
door
of
the
closet
,
and
displayed
Laurie
sitting

``
You

Jo
,
how

you
?
''
cried
the
three
girls
,
as
*NL*
Snodgrass
led
her
friend
triumphantly
forth
;
and
,
producing
both
a
chair
*NL*
and
a
badge
,
installed
him
in
a
jiffy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
coolness
of
you

rascals
is
amazing
,
''
began
Mr.
Pickwick
,
trying
*NL*
to
get
up
an
awful
frown
,
and
only
succeeding
in
producing
an
amiable
*NL*
smile
.
But
the
new
member
was
equal
to
the
occasion
;
and
,
rising
,
with
a
*NL*
grateful
salutation
to
the
Chair
,
said
,
in
the
most
engaging
manner
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
President
and
ladies
,
--
I
beg
pardon
,
gentlemen
,
--
allow
me
to
*NL*
introduce
myself
as
Sam
Weller
,
the
very
humble
servant
of
the
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
good
!
''
cried
Jo
,
pounding
with
the
handle
of
the
old
warming-pan
*NL*
on
which
she
leaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
faithful
friend
and
noble
patron

''
continued
Laurie
,
with
a
wave
of
*NL*
the
hand
,
``
who
has
so
flatteringly
presented
me
,
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
*NL*
the
base
stratagem
of
to-night
.
I
planned
it
,
and
she
only
gave
in
after
*NL*
lots
of
teasing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
now
,
do
n't
lay
it
all
on
yourself
;
you
know
I
proposed
the
*NL*
cupboard

''
broke
in
Snodgrass
,
who
was
enjoying
the
joke
amazingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
you
mind
what
she
says
.
I
'm
the
wretch
that
did
it
,

,
''
said
*NL*
the
new
member
,
with
a
Welleresque
nod
to
Mr.
Pickwick
.
``
But
on
my
*NL*
honor
,
I
never
will
do
so
again
,
and
henceforth
_
dewote
_
myself
to
the
*NL*
interest
of
this
immortal
club
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
!
hear
!
''
cried
Jo
,
clashing
the
lid
of
the
warming-pan
like
a
*NL*
cymbal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
go
on
!
''
added
Winkle
and
Tupman
,
while
the
President
bowed
*NL*
benignly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
wish
to
say
,
that
as
a
slight
token
of
my
gratitude
for
the
*NL*
honor
done
me
,
and
as
a
means
of
promoting
friendly
relations
between
*NL*
adjoining
nations
,
I
have
set
up
a
post-office
in
the
hedge
in
the
lower
*NL*
corner
of
the
garden
;
a
fine
,
spacious
building
,
with
padlocks
on
the
*NL*
doors
,
and
every
convenience
for
the
mails
,
--
also
the
females
,
if
I
may
*NL*
be
allowed
the
expression
.
It
's
the
old
martin-house
;
but
I
've
stopped
*NL*
up
the
door
,
and
made
the
roof
open
,
so
it
will
hold
all
sorts
of
*NL*
things
,
and
save
our
valuable
time
.
Letters
,
manuscripts
,
books
,
and
*NL*
bundles
can
be
passed
in
there
;
and
,
as
each
nation
has
a
key
,
it
will
*NL*
be
uncommonly
nice
,
I
fancy
.
Allow
me
to
present
the
club
key
;
and
,
*NL*
with
many
thanks
for
your
favor
,
take
my
seat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Great
applause
as
Mr.
Weller
deposited
a
little
key
on
the
table
,
and
*NL*
subsided
;
the
warming-pan
clashed
and
waved
wildly
,
and
it
was
some
time
*NL*
before
order
could
be
restored
.
A
long
discussion
followed
,
and
every
*NL*
one
came
out
surprising
,
for
every
one
did
her
best
;
so
it
was
an
*NL*
unusually
lively
meeting
,
and
did
not
adjourn
till
a
late
hour
,
when
it
*NL*
broke
up
with
three
shrill
cheers
for
the
new
member
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
ever
regretted
the
admittance
of
Sam
Weller
,
for
a
more
devoted
,
*NL*
well-behaved
,
and
jovial
member
no
club
could
have
.
He
certainly
did
add
*NL*
``
spirit
''
to
the
meetings
,
and
``
a
tone
''
to
the
paper
;
for
his
orations
*NL*
convulsed
his
hearers
,
and
his
contributions
were
excellent
,
being
*NL*
patriotic
,
classical
,
comical
,
or
dramatic
,
but
never
sentimental
.
Jo
*NL*
regarded
them
as
worthy
of
Bacon
,
Milton
,
or
Shakespeare
;
and
remodelled
*NL*
her
own
works
with
good
effect
,
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
P.
O.
was
a
capital
little
institution
,
and
flourished
wonderfully
,
*NL*
for
nearly
as
many
queer
things
passed
through
it
as
through
the
real
*NL*
office
.
Tragedies
and
cravats
,
poetry
and
pickles
,
garden-seeds
and
long
*NL*
letters
,
music
and
gingerbread
,
rubbers
,
invitations
,
scoldings
and
*NL*
puppies
.
The
old
gentleman
liked
the
fun
,
and
amused
himself
by
sending
*NL*
odd
bundles
,
mysterious
messages
,
and
funny
telegrams
;
and
his
gardener
,
*NL*
who
was
smitten
with
Hannah
's
charms
,
actually
sent
a
love-letter
to
*NL*
Jo
's
care
.
How
they
laughed
when
the
secret
came
out
,
never
dreaming
how
*NL*
many
love-letters
that
little
post-office
would
hold
in
the
years
to
*NL*
come
!

exclaimed
Meg
,
*NL*
coming
home
one
warm
day
to
find
Jo
laid
upon
the
sofa
in
an
unusual
*NL*
state
of
exhaustion
,
while
Beth
took
off
her
dusty
boots
,
and
Amy
made
*NL*
lemonade
for
the
refreshment
of
the
whole
party

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
March
went
to-day
,
for
which
,
oh

be
joyful

said
Jo
.
``
I
was
*NL*
mortally
afraid
she
'd
ask
me
to
go
with
her
;
if
she
had

I
should
have
*NL*
felt
as
if
I
ought
to
do
it
;
but
Plumfield
is
about
as
gay
as
a
*NL*
churchyard
,
you
know
,
and
I
'd
rather
be
excused
.
We
had
a
flurry
getting
*NL*
the
old
lady
off
,
and
I
had
a
fright
every
time
she
spoke
to
me
,
for
I
*NL*
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
be
through
that
I
was
uncommonly
helpful
and
*NL*
sweet
,
and
feared
she
'd
find
it
impossible
to
part
from
me
.
I
quaked
*NL*
till
she
was
fairly
in
the
carriage
,
and
had
a
final
fright

for
,
as
it

drove
off

popped
out

saying

*NL*
I
did
n't
hear
any
more
,
for
I
basely
turned

fled

I
did
actually
*NL*
run

and
whisked
round
the
corner

where
I
felt
safe

*NL*
``
Poor

she
came
in

Beth
,
as
she
cuddled
her
sister
's
feet
with
a
motherly
air
.

*NL*
``
Aunt

observed
Amy
,
tasting
*NL*
her
mixture
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
means

not
sea-weed

it

particular
about

murmured
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
you
do
all

asked
Amy

changing
the
subject

*NL*
with
tact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
lie
abed
late

replied
Meg
,
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
the
rocking-chair
.
``
I

implored
Amy
,
as
a
return
snub
for
the
``

*NL*
correction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
say

*NL*
``
Well

*NL*
*NL*
``
May

asked
Meg

turning
to
Mrs.

who
sat
sewing

what
they
called

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
try
your

think
by

night
you
will
find

bad
as

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

it
will
be

Fun

cried
Jo
,
rising

glass
in
hand
,
as
the
*NL*
lemonade
went
round
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
all
drank
it
merrily
,
and
began
the
experiment
by
lounging
for
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
day
.
Next
morning
,
Meg
did
not
appear
till
ten
o'clock
;
her
*NL*
solitary
breakfast
did
not
taste
nice
,
and
the
room
seemed
lonely
and
*NL*
untidy
;
for
Jo
had
not
filled
the
vases
,
Beth
had
not
dusted
,
and
Amy
's
*NL*
books
lay
scattered
about
.
Nothing
was
neat
and
pleasant
but
``
Marmee
's
*NL*
corner
,
''
which
looked
as
usual
;
and
there
Meg
sat
,
to
``
rest
and
read
,
''
*NL*
which
meant
yawn
,
and
imagine
what
pretty
summer
dresses
she
would
get
*NL*
with
her
salary
.
Jo
spent
the
morning
on
the
river
,
with
Laurie
,
and
the
*NL*
afternoon
reading
and
crying
over
``
The
Wide
,
Wide
World
,
''
up
in
the
*NL*
apple-tree
.
Beth
began
by
rummaging
everything
out
of
the
big
closet
,
*NL*
where
her
family
resided
;
but
,
getting
tired
before
half
done
,
she
left
*NL*
her
establishment
topsy-turvy
,
and
went
to
her
music
,
rejoicing
that
she
*NL*
had
no
dishes
to
wash
.
Amy
arranged
her
bower
,
put
on
her
best
white
*NL*
frock
,
smoothed
her
curls
,
and
sat
down
to
draw
,
under
the
honeysuckles
,
*NL*
hoping
some
one
would
see
and
inquire
who
the
young
artist
was
.
As
no
*NL*
one
appeared
but
an
inquisitive
daddy-long-legs
,
who
examined
her
work
*NL*
with
interest
,
she
went
to
walk
,
got
caught
in
a
shower
,
and
came
home
*NL*
dripping
.

At
tea-time
they
compared
notes
,
and
all
agreed
that
it
had
been
a
*NL*
delightful
,
though
unusually
long
day
.
Meg
,
who
went
shopping
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
got
a
``
sweet
blue
muslin
,
''
had
discovered
,
after
she
had
*NL*
cut
the
breadths
off
,
that
it
would
n't
wash
,
which
mishap
made
her
*NL*
slightly
cross
.
Jo
had
burnt
the
skin
off
her
nose
boating
,
and
got
a
*NL*
raging
headache
by
reading
too
long
.
Beth
was
worried
by
the
confusion
*NL*
of
her
closet
,
and
the
difficulty
of
learning
three
or
four
songs
at
*NL*
once
;
and
Amy
deeply
regretted
the
damage
done
her
frock
,
for
Katy
*NL*
Brown
's
party
was
to
be
the
next
day
;
and
now
,
like
Flora
McFlimsey
,
she
*NL*
had
``
nothing
to
wear
.
''
But
these
were
mere
trifles
;
and
they
assured
*NL*
their
mother
that
the
experiment
was
working
finely
.
She
smiled
,
said
*NL*
nothing
,
and
,
with
Hannah
's
help
,
did
their
neglected
work
,
keeping
home
*NL*
pleasant
,
and
the
domestic
machinery
running
smoothly
.
It
was
*NL*
astonishing
what
a
peculiar
and
uncomfortable
state
of
things
was
*NL*
produced
by
the
``
resting
and
revelling
''
process
.
The
days
kept
getting
*NL*
longer
and
longer
;
the
weather
was
unusually
variable
,
and
so
were
*NL*
tempers
;
an
unsettled
feeling
possessed
every
one
,
and
Satan
found
*NL*
plenty
of
mischief
for
the
idle
hands
to
do
.
As
the
height
of
luxury
,
*NL*
Meg
put
out
some
of
her
sewing
,
and
then
found
time
hang
so
heavily
that
*NL*
she
fell
to
snipping
and
spoiling
her
clothes
,
in
her
attempts
to
*NL*
furbish
them
up
a
la
Moffat
.
Jo
read
till
her
eyes
gave
out
,
and
she
was
*NL*
sick
of
books
;
got
so
fidgety
that
even
good-natured
Laurie
had
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
her
,
and
so
reduced
in
spirits
that
she
desperately
wished
*NL*
she
had
gone
with
Aunt
March
.
Beth
got
on
pretty
well
,
for
she
was
*NL*
constantly
forgetting
that
it
was
to
be
_
all
play
,
and
no
work
_
,
and
*NL*
fell
back
into
her
old
ways
now
and
then
;
but
something
in
the
air
*NL*
affected
her
,
and
,
more
than
once
,
her
tranquillity
was
much
disturbed
;
*NL*
so
much
so
,
that
,
on
one
occasion
,
she
actually
shook
poor
dear
Joanna
,
*NL*
and
told
her
she
was
``
a
fright
.
''
Amy
fared
worst
of
all
,
for
her
*NL*
resources
were
small
;
and
when
her
sisters
left
her
to
amuse
and
care
*NL*
for
herself
,
she
soon
found
that
accomplished
and
important
little
self
*NL*
a
great
burden
.
She
did
n't
like
dolls
,
fairy-tales
were
childish
,
and
*NL*
one
could
n't
draw
all
the
time
;
tea-parties
did
n't
amount
to
much
,
*NL*
neither
did
picnics
,
unless
very
well
conducted
.
``
If
one
could
have
a
*NL*
fine
house
,
full
of
nice
girls
,
or
go
travelling
,
the
summer
would
be
*NL*
delightful
;
but
to
stay
at
home
with
three
selfish
sisters
and
a
*NL*
grown-up
boy
was
enough
to
try
the
patience
of
a
Boaz
,
''
complained
Miss
*NL*
Malaprop
,
after
several
days
devoted
to
pleasure
,
fretting
,
and
_
ennui
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
would
own
that
they
were
tired
of
the
experiment
;
but
,
by
Friday
*NL*
night
,
each
acknowledged
to
herself
that
she
was
glad
the
week
was
*NL*
nearly
done
.
Hoping
to
impress
the
lesson
more
deeply
,
Mrs.
March
,
who
*NL*
had
a
good
deal
of
humor
,
resolved
to
finish
off
the
trial
in
an
*NL*
appropriate
manner
;
so
she
gave
Hannah
a
holiday
,
and
let
the
girls
*NL*
enjoy
the
full
effect
of
the
play
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
got
up
on
Saturday
morning
,
there
was
no
fire
in
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
no
breakfast
in
the
dining-room
,
and
no
mother
anywhere
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
!
what
_
has
_
happened
?
''
cried
Jo
,
staring
about
her
in
*NL*
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
ran
upstairs
,
and
soon
came
back
again
,
looking
relieved
,
but
rather
*NL*
bewildered
,
and
a
little
ashamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
is
n't
sick
,
only
very
tired
,
and
she
says
she
is
going
to
stay
*NL*
quietly
in
her
room
all
day
,
and
let
us
do
the
best
we
can
.
It
's
a
very
*NL*
queer
thing
for
her
to
do
,
she
does
n't
act
a
bit
like
herself
;
but
she
*NL*
says
it
has
been
a
hard
week
for
her
,
so
we
must
n't
grumble
,
but
take
*NL*
care
of
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
easy
enough
,
and
I
like
the
idea
;
I
'm
aching
for
something
to
*NL*
do
--
that
is
,
some
new
amusement
,
you
know
,
''
added
Jo
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
fact
it
_
was
_
an
immense
relief
to
them
all
to
have
a
little
work
,
*NL*
and
they
took
hold
with
a
will
,
but
soon
realized
the
truth
of
Hannah
's
*NL*
saying
,
``
Housekeeping
ai
n't
no
joke
.
''
There
was
plenty
of
food
in
the
*NL*
larder
,
and
,
while
Beth
and
Amy
set
the
table
,
Meg
and
Jo
got
breakfast
,
*NL*
wondering
,
as
they
did
so
,
why
servants
ever
talked
about
hard
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
take
some
up
to
mother
,
though
she
said
we
were
not
to
think
of
*NL*
her
,
for
she
'd
take
care
of
herself
,
''
said
Meg
,
who
presided
,
and
felt
*NL*
quite
matronly
behind
the
teapot
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
a
tray
was
fitted
out
before
any
one
began
,
and
taken
up
,
with
the
*NL*
cook
's
compliments
.
The
boiled
tea
was
very
bitter
,
the
omelette
*NL*
scorched
,
and
the
biscuits
speckled
with
saleratus
;
but
Mrs.
March
*NL*
received
her
repast
with
thanks
,
and
laughed
heartily
over
it
after
Jo
*NL*
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
souls
,
they
will
have
a
hard
time
,
I
'm
afraid
;
but
they
*NL*
wo
n't
suffer
,
and
it
will
do
them
good
,
''
she
said
,
producing
the
more
*NL*
palatable
viands
with
which
she
had
provided
herself
,
and
disposing
of
*NL*
the
bad
breakfast
,
so
that
their
feelings
might
not
be
hurt
,
--
a
motherly
*NL*
little
deception
,
for
which
they
were
grateful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
were
the
complaints
below
,
and
great
the
chagrin
of
the
head
cook
*NL*
at
her
failures
.
``
Never
mind
,
I
'll
get
the
dinner
,
and
be
servant
;
you
*NL*
be
mistress
,
keep
your
hands
nice
,
see
company
,
and
give
orders
,
''
said
*NL*
Jo
,
who
knew
still
less
than
Meg
about
culinary
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
obliging
offer
was
gladly
accepted
;
and
Margaret
retired
to
the
*NL*
parlor
,
which
she
hastily
put
in
order
by
whisking
the
litter
under
the
*NL*
sofa
,
and
shutting
the
blinds
,
to
save
the
trouble
of
dusting
.
Jo
,
with
*NL*
perfect
faith
in
her
own
powers
,
and
a
friendly
desire
to
make
up
the
*NL*
quarrel
,
immediately
put
a
note
in
the
office
,
inviting
Laurie
to
*NL*
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
see
what
you
have
got
before
you
think
of
having
company
,
''
*NL*
said
Meg
,
when
informed
of
the
hospitable
but
rash
act
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
there
's
corned
beef
and
plenty
of
potatoes
;
and
I
shall
get
some
*NL*
asparagus
,
and
a
lobster
,
`
for
a
relish
,
'
as
Hannah
says
.
We
'll
have
*NL*
lettuce
,
and
make
a
salad
.
I
do
n't
know
how
,
but
the
book
tells
.
I
'll
*NL*
have
blanc-mange
and
strawberries
for
dessert
;
and
coffee
,
too
,
if
you
*NL*
want
to
be
elegant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
try
too
many
messes
,
Jo
,
for
you
ca
n't
make
anything
but
*NL*
gingerbread
and
molasses
candy
,
fit
to
eat
.
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
*NL*
dinner-party
;
and
,
since
you
have
asked
Laurie
on
your
own
*NL*
responsibility
,
you
may
just
take
care
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
you
to
do
anything
but
be
civil
to
him
,
and
help
to
the
*NL*
pudding
.
You
'll
give
me
your
advice
if
I
get
in
a
muddle
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
asked
Jo
,
rather
hurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
do
n't
know
much
,
except
about
bread
,
and
a
few
trifles
.
You
*NL*
had
better
ask
mother
's
leave
before
you
order
anything
,
''
returned
Meg
*NL*
prudently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
shall
;
I
'm
not
a
fool
,
''
and
Jo
went
off
in
a
huff
at
the
*NL*
doubts
expressed
of
her
powers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
what
you
like
,
and
do
n't
disturb
me
;
I
'm
going
out
to
dinner
,
and
*NL*
ca
n't
worry
about
things
at
home
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
when
Jo
spoke
to
*NL*
her
.
``
I
never
enjoyed
housekeeping
,
and
I
'm
going
to
take
a
vacation
*NL*
to-day
,
and
read
,
write
,
go
visiting
,
and
amuse
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
unusual
spectacle
of
her
busy
mother
rocking
comfortably
,
and
*NL*
reading
,
early
in
the
morning
,
made
Jo
feel
as
if
some
natural
*NL*
phenomenon
had
occurred
,
for
an
eclipse
,
an
earthquake
,
or
a
volcanic
*NL*
eruption
would
hardly
have
seemed
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
is
out
of
sorts
,
somehow
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
going
down
*NL*
stairs
.
``
There
's
Beth
crying
;
that
's
a
sure
sign
that
something
is
wrong
*NL*
with
this
family
.
If
Amy
is
bothering
,
I
'll
shake
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
very
much
out
of
sorts
herself
,
Jo
hurried
into
the
parlor
to
*NL*
find
Beth
sobbing
over
Pip
,
the
canary
,
who
lay
dead
in
the
cage
,
with
*NL*
his
little
claws
pathetically
extended
,
as
if
imploring
the
food
for
*NL*
want
of
which
he
had
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
my
fault
--
I
forgot
him
--
there
is
n't
a
seed
or
a
drop
left
.
O
*NL*
Pip
!
O
Pip
!
how
could
I
be
so
cruel
to
you
?
''
cried
Beth
,
taking
the
poor
*NL*
thing
in
her
hands
,
and
trying
to
restore
him
.
*NL*
*NL*

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
peeped
into
his
half-open
eye
,
felt
his
little
heart
,
and
finding
him
*NL*
stiff
and
cold
,
shook
her
head
,
and
offered
her
domino-box
for
a
coffin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
him
in
the
oven
,
and
maybe
he
will
get
warm
and
revive
,
''
said
Amy
*NL*
hopefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
been
starved
,
and
he
sha
'n'
t
be
baked
,
now
he
's
dead
.
I
'll
make
*NL*
him
a
shroud
,
and
he
shall
be
buried
in
the
garden
;
and
I
'll
never
have
*NL*
another
bird
,
never
,
my
Pip
!
for
I
am
too
bad
to
own
one
,
''
murmured
*NL*
Beth
,
sitting
on
the
floor
with
her
pet
folded
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
funeral
shall
be
this
afternoon
,
and
we
will
all
go
.
Now
,
do
n't
*NL*
cry
,
Bethy
;
it
's
a
pity
,
but
nothing
goes
right
this
week
,
and
Pip
has
*NL*
had
the
worst
of
the
experiment
.
Make
the
shroud
,
and
lay
him
in
my
box
;
*NL*
and
,
after
the
dinner-party
,
we
'll
have
a
nice
little
funeral
,
''
said
Jo
,
*NL*
beginning
to
feel
as
if
she
had
undertaken
a
good
deal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
the
others
to
console
Beth
,
she
departed
to
the
kitchen
,
which
*NL*
was
in
a
most
discouraging
state
of
confusion
.
Putting
on
a
big
apron
,
*NL*
she
fell
to
work
,
and
got
the
dishes
piled
up
ready
for
washing
,
when
*NL*
she
discovered
that
the
fire
was
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
sweet
prospect
!
''
muttered
Jo
,
slamming
the
stove-door
open
,
*NL*
and
poking
vigorously
among
the
cinders
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
rekindled
the
fire
,
she
thought
she
would
go
to
market
while
the
*NL*
water
heated
.
The
walk
revived
her
spirits
;
and
,
flattering
herself
that
*NL*
she
had
made
good
bargains
,
she
trudged
home
again
,
after
buying
a
very
*NL*
young
lobster
,
some
very
old
asparagus
,
and
two
boxes
of
acid
*NL*
strawberries
.
By
the
time
she
got
cleared
up
,
the
dinner
arrived
,
and
*NL*
the
stove
was
red-hot
.
Hannah
had
left
a
pan
of
bread
to
rise
,
Meg
had
*NL*
worked
it
up
early
,
set
it
on
the
hearth
for
a
second
rising
,
and
*NL*
forgotten
it
.
Meg
was
entertaining
Sallie
Gardiner
in
the
parlor
,
when
*NL*
the
door
flew
open
,
and
a
floury
,
crocky
,
flushed
,
and
dishevelled
*NL*
figure
appeared
,
demanding
tartly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
is
n't
bread
`
riz
'
enough
when
it
runs
over
the
pans
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sallie
began
to
laugh
;
but
Meg
nodded
,
and
lifted
her
eyebrows
as
high
*NL*
as
they
would
go
,
which
caused
the
apparition
to
vanish
,
and
put
the
*NL*
sour
bread
into
the
oven
without
further
delay
.
Mrs.
March
went
out
,
*NL*
after
peeping
here
and
there
to
see
how
matters
went
,
also
saying
a
word
*NL*
of
comfort
to
Beth
,
who
sat
making
a
winding-sheet
,
while
the
dear
*NL*
departed
lay
in
state
in
the
domino-box
.
A
strange
sense
of
helplessness
*NL*
fell
upon
the
girls
as
the
gray
bonnet
vanished
round
the
corner
;
and
*NL*
despair
seized
them
,
when
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
Miss
Crocker
appeared
,
*NL*
and
said
she
'd
come
to
dinner
.
Now
,
this
lady
was
a
thin
,
yellow
*NL*
spinster
,
with
a
sharp
nose
and
inquisitive
eyes
,
who
saw
everything
,
*NL*
and
gossiped
about
all
she
saw
.
They
disliked
her
,
but
had
been
taught
*NL*
to
be
kind
to
her
,
simply
because
she
was
old
and
poor
,
and
had
few
*NL*
friends
.
So
Meg
gave
her
the
easy-chair
,
and
tried
to
entertain
her
,
*NL*
while
she
asked
questions
,
criticised
everything
,
and
told
stories
of
*NL*
the
people
whom
she
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Language
can
not
describe
the
anxieties
,
experiences
,
and
exertions
which
*NL*
Jo
underwent
that
morning
;
and
the
dinner
she
served
up
became
a
*NL*
standing
joke
.
Fearing
to
ask
any
more
advice
,
she
did
her
best
alone
,
*NL*
and
discovered
that
something
more
than
energy
and
good-will
is
*NL*
necessary
to
make
a
cook
.
She
boiled
the
asparagus
for
an
hour
,
and
was
*NL*
grieved
to
find
the
heads
cooked
off
and
the
stalks
harder
than
ever
.
*NL*
The
bread
burnt
black
;
for
the
salad-dressing
so
aggravated
her
,
that
*NL*
she
let
everything
else
go
till
she
had
convinced
herself
that
she
could
*NL*
not
make
it
fit
to
eat
.
The
lobster
was
a
scarlet
mystery
to
her
,
but
*NL*
she
hammered
and
poked
,
till
it
was
unshelled
,
and
its
meagre
*NL*
proportions
concealed
in
a
grove
of
lettuce-leaves
.
The
potatoes
had
to
*NL*
be
hurried
,
not
to
keep
the
asparagus
waiting
,
and
were
not
done
at
*NL*
last
.
The
blanc-mange
was
lumpy
,
and
the
strawberries
not
as
ripe
as
*NL*
they
looked
,
having
been
skilfully
``
deaconed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
they
can
eat
beef
,
and
bread
and
butter
,
if
they
are
hungry
;
only
*NL*
it
's
mortifying
to
have
to
spend
your
whole
morning
for
nothing
,
''
*NL*
thought
Jo
,
as
she
rang
the
bell
half
an
hour
later
than
usual
,
and
*NL*
stood
,
hot
,
tired
,
and
dispirited
,
surveying
the
feast
spread
for
*NL*
Laurie
,
accustomed
to
all
sorts
of
elegance
,
and
Miss
Crocker
,
whose
*NL*
curious
eyes
would
mark
all
failures
,
and
whose
tattling
tongue
would
*NL*
report
them
far
and
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jo
would
gladly
have
gone
under
the
table
,
as
one
thing
after
*NL*
another
was
tasted
and
left
;
while
Amy
giggled
,
Meg
looked
distressed
,
*NL*
Miss
Crocker
pursed
up
her
lips
,
and
Laurie
talked
and
laughed
with
all
*NL*
his
might
,
to
give
a
cheerful
tone
to
the
festive
scene
.
Jo
's
one
strong
*NL*
point
was
the
fruit
,
for
she
had
sugared
it
well
,
and
had
a
pitcher
of
*NL*
rich
cream
to
eat
with
it
.
Her
hot
cheeks
cooled
a
trifle
,
and
she
drew
*NL*
a
long
breath
,
as
the
pretty
glass
plates
went
round
,
and
every
one
*NL*
looked
graciously
at
the
little
rosy
islands
floating
in
a
sea
of
cream
.
*NL*
Miss
Crocker
tasted
first
,
made
a
wry
face
,
and
drank
some
water
*NL*
hastily
.
Jo
,
who
had
refused
,
thinking
there
might
not
be
enough
,
for
*NL*
they
dwindled
sadly
after
the
picking
over
,
glanced
at
Laurie
,
but
he
*NL*
was
eating
away
manfully
,
though
there
was
a
slight
pucker
about
his
*NL*
mouth
,
and
he
kept
his
eye
fixed
on
his
plate
.
Amy
,
who
was
fond
of
*NL*
delicate
fare
,
took
a
heaping
spoonful
,
choked
,
hid
her
face
in
her
*NL*
napkin
,
and
left
the
table
precipitately
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
is
it
?
''
exclaimed
Jo
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Salt
instead
of
sugar
,
and
the
cream
is
sour
,
''
replied
Meg
,
with
a
*NL*
tragic
gesture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
uttered
a
groan
,
and
fell
back
in
her
chair
;
remembering
that
she
had
*NL*
given
a
last
hasty
powdering
to
the
berries
out
of
one
of
the
two
boxes
*NL*
on
the
kitchen
table
,
and
had
neglected
to
put
the
milk
in
the
*NL*
refrigerator
.
She
turned
scarlet
,
and
was
on
the
verge
of
crying
,
when
*NL*
she
met
Laurie
's
eyes
,
which
_
would
_
look
merry
in
spite
of
his
heroic
*NL*
efforts
;
the
comical
side
of
the
affair
suddenly
struck
her
,
and
she
*NL*
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
her
cheeks
.
So
did
every
one
else
,
even
*NL*
``
Croaker
,
''
as
the
girls
called
the
old
lady
;
and
the
unfortunate
dinner
*NL*
ended
gayly
,
with
bread
and
butter
,
olives
and
fun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
strength
of
mind
enough
to
clear
up
now
,
so
we
will
sober
*NL*
ourselves
with
a
funeral
,
''
said
Jo
,
as
they
rose
;
and
Miss
Crocker
made
*NL*
ready
to
go
,
being
eager
to
tell
the
new
story
at
another
friend
's
*NL*
dinner-table
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
sober
themselves
,
for
Beth
's
sake
;
Laurie
dug
a
grave
under
the
*NL*
ferns
in
the
grove
,
little
Pip
was
laid
in
,
with
many
tears
,
by
his
*NL*
tender-hearted
mistress
,
and
covered
with
moss
,
while
a
wreath
of
*NL*
violets
and
chickweed
was
hung
on
the
stone
which
bore
his
epitaph
,
*NL*
composed
by
Jo
,
while
she
struggled
with
the
dinner
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
lies
Pip
March
,
*NL*
Who
died
the
7th
of
June
;
*NL*
Loved
and
lamented
sore
,
*NL*
And
not
forgotten
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
conclusion
of
the
ceremonies
,
Beth
retired
to
her
room
,
overcome
*NL*
with
emotion
and
lobster
;
but
there
was
no
place
of
repose
,
for
the
beds
*NL*
were
not
made
,
and
she
found
her
grief
much
assuaged
by
beating
up
*NL*
pillows
and
putting
things
in
order
.
Meg
helped
Jo
clear
away
the
*NL*
remains
of
the
feast
,
which
took
half
the
afternoon
,
and
left
them
so
*NL*
tired
that
they
agreed
to
be
contented
with
tea
and
toast
for
supper
.
*NL*
Laurie
took
Amy
to
drive
,
which
was
a
deed
of
charity
,
for
the
sour
*NL*
cream
seemed
to
have
had
a
bad
effect
upon
her
temper
.
Mrs.
March
came
*NL*
home
to
find
the
three
older
girls
hard
at
work
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
;
and
a
glance
at
the
closet
gave
her
an
idea
of
the
success
of
*NL*
one
part
of
the
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
housewives
could
rest
,
several
people
called
,
and
there
was
a
*NL*
scramble
to
get
ready
to
see
them
;
then
tea
must
be
got
,
errands
done
;
*NL*
and
one
or
two
necessary
bits
of
sewing
neglected
till
the
last
minute
.
*NL*
As
twilight
fell
,
dewy
and
still
,
one
by
one
they
gathered
in
the
porch
*NL*
where
the
June
roses
were
budding
beautifully
,
and
each
groaned
or
*NL*
sighed
as
she
sat
down
,
as
if
tired
or
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dreadful
day
this
has
been
!
''
begun
Jo
,
usually
the
first
to
*NL*
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
has
seemed
shorter
than
usual
,
but
_
so
_
uncomfortable
,
''
said
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
like
home
,
''
added
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
seem
so
without
Marmee
and
little
Pip
,
''
sighed
Beth
,
glancing
,
*NL*
with
full
eyes
,
at
the
empty
cage
above
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
mother
,
dear
,
and
you
shall
have
another
bird
to-morrow
,
if
you
*NL*
want
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
Mrs.
March
came
and
took
her
place
among
them
,
looking
as
*NL*
if
her
holiday
had
not
been
much
pleasanter
than
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
satisfied
with
your
experiment
,
girls
,
or
do
you
want
another
*NL*
week
of
it
?
''
she
asked
,
as
Beth
nestled
up
to
her
,
and
the
rest
turned
*NL*
toward
her
with
brightening
faces
,
as
flowers
turn
toward
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
!
''
cried
Jo
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
''
echoed
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
,
then
,
that
it
is
better
to
have
a
few
duties
,
and
live
a
*NL*
little
for
others
,
do
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lounging
and
larking
does
n't
pay
,
''
observed
Jo
,
shaking
her
head
.
``
I
'm
*NL*
tired
of
it
,
and
mean
to
go
to
work
at
something
right
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
you
learn
plain
cooking
;
that
's
a
useful
accomplishment
,
which
*NL*
no
woman
should
be
without
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
laughing
inaudibly
at
the
*NL*
recollection
of
Jo
's
dinner-party
;
for
she
had
met
Miss
Crocker
,
and
*NL*
heard
her
account
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
,
did
you
go
away
and
let
everything
be
,
just
to
see
how
we
'd
get
*NL*
on
?
''
cried
Meg
,
who
had
had
suspicions
all
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
wanted
you
to
see
how
the
comfort
of
all
depends
on
each
doing
*NL*
her
share
faithfully
.
While
Hannah
and
I
did
your
work
,
you
got
on
*NL*
pretty
well
,
though
I
do
n't
think
you
were
very
happy
or
amiable
;
so
I
*NL*
thought
,
as
a
little
lesson
,
I
would
show
you
what
happens
when
every
*NL*
one
thinks
only
of
herself
.
Do
n't
you
feel
that
it
is
pleasanter
to
help
*NL*
one
another
,
to
have
daily
duties
which
make
leisure
sweet
when
it
*NL*
comes
,
and
to
bear
and
forbear
,
that
home
may
be
comfortable
and
lovely
*NL*
to
us
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do

we
do

cried
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
me
advise
you
to
take
up
your
little
burdens
again
;
for
though
*NL*
they
seem
heavy
sometimes
,
they
are
good
for
us
,
and
lighten
as
we
learn
*NL*
to
carry
them
.
Work
is
wholesome
,
and
there
is
plenty
for
every
one
;
it
*NL*
keeps
us
from
_
ennui
_
and
mischief
,
is
good
for
health
and
spirits
,
and
*NL*
gives
us
a
sense
of
power
and
independence
better
than
money
or

fashion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
work
like

love
it
too

if
we
do

said
Jo
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
learn
plain

be

I
can

I
will

not
fond

better
than
fussing
over

Meg

*NL*

I
'll
do
my
lessons
every

not
spend
so
much
time
with
my
music

I
am
a
stupid
thing
,
and
ought
to
be
studying

not
playing

*NL*
was
Beth
's
resolution
;
while
Amy
followed
their
example
by
heroically
*NL*
declaring
,
``
I
shall
learn
to
make
button-holes
,
and
attend
to
my
parts

of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
!
then
I
am
quite
satisfied
with
the
experiment

and
fancy
*NL*
that
we
shall
not
have
to
repeat
it
;
only
do
n't
go
to
the
other
extreme
,
*NL*
and
delve
like
slaves
.
Have
regular
hours
for
work
and
play
;
make
each
*NL*
day
both
useful
and
pleasant
,
and
prove
that
you
understand
the
worth
of
*NL*
time
by
employing
it
well
.
Then
youth
will
be
delightful
,
old
age
will
*NL*
bring
few
regrets

life
become
a
beautiful
success

poverty

Beth
was
post-mistress

for

being
most
at

she
could
attend

*NL*
regularly
,
and
dearly
liked
the
daily
task
of
unlocking
the
little
door

and
distributing
the

One
July
day
she
came
in
with

hands
full

went
about

house
leaving
letters

sat
near

stitching
wristbands

Mrs.

gingham

with
the
little

blowing
about

very

womanly

as
she
sat
sewing
at
her
little
work-table
,
full
of
tidy
white
*NL*
rolls
;
so
unconscious
of
the
thought
in
her
mother
's
mind
as
she
sewed
*NL*
and
sung
,
while
her
fingers
flew
,

her
thoughts
were
busied
with

girlish
fancies

innocent

fresh

Laying

Jo
wet
her

for
she

appreciated

this

doubly
precious

doubly

pinned
the

DEAR
JO
,
*NL*
What
ho
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
English
girls
and
boys
are
coming
to
see
me
to-morrow
and
*NL*
I
want
to
have
a
jolly
time
.
If
it
's
fine
,
I
'm
going
to
pitch
*NL*
my
tent
in
Longmeadow
,
and
row
up
the
whole
crew
to
lunch
and
*NL*
croquet
,
--
have
a
fire
,
make
messes
,
gypsy
fashion
,
and
all
*NL*
sorts
of
larks
.
They
are
nice
people
,
and
like
such
things
.
*NL*
Brooke
will
go
,
to
keep
us
boys
steady
,
and
Kate
Vaughn
will
*NL*
play
propriety
for
the
girls
.
I
want
you
all
to
come
;
ca
n't
let
*NL*
Beth
off
,
at
any
price
,
and
nobody
shall
worry
her
.
Do
n't
*NL*
bother
about
rations
,
--
I
'll
see
to
that
,
and
everything
*NL*
else
,
--
only
do
come
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
!

*NL*
*NL*

Here
's
richness

cried
Jo
,
flying
in
to
tell
the
news
to
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
we
can
go
,
mother
?
it
will
be
such
a
help
to
Laurie
,
for
I
*NL*
can
row
,
and
Meg
see
to
the
lunch
,
and
the
children
be
useful
in
some
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
the
Vaughns
are
not
fine
,
grown-up
people
.
Do
you
know
anything
*NL*
about
them

Jo
?
''
asked
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
that
there
are
four
of

Kate

about

,
who
is

or
*NL*
ten

Laurie
knew
them
abroad
,
and
liked
the
boys
;
I
fancied
,
from
the
*NL*
way
he
primmed
up
his
mouth
in
speaking
of
her
,
that
he
did
n't
admire

*NL*

you

it

Fighting
faults
is
n't
easy

as
I
know

and
a
cheery
word
*NL*
kind
of
gives
a
lift
.
Thank
you

mother
,
''
and
Jo
gave
the
thin
cheek
a
*NL*
grateful
kiss
,
more
precious
to
Mrs.
March
than
if
it
had
given
back
the
*NL*
rosy
roundness
of
her
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
box
of
chocolate
drops

said
*NL*
Amy
,
showing
her
mail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
got
a
note
from
Mr.
Laurence

come
over

him
to-night
,
before
the
lamps
are
lighted
,
and
I
shall
go
,
''
added
Beth
,
*NL*
whose
friendship
with
the
old
gentleman
prospered
finely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
's
fly
round
,
and
do
double
duty
to-day
,
so
that
we
can
play

to-morrow
with
free

said
Jo
,
preparing
to
replace
her
pen
with
a
*NL*
broom
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sun
peeped
into
the
girls
'
room
early
next
morning
,
to
promise
*NL*
them
a
fine
day
,
he
saw
a
comical
sight
.
Each
had
made
such
preparation
*NL*
for
the
fete
as
seemed
necessary
and
proper
.
Meg
had
an
extra
row
of
*NL*
little
curl-papers
across
her
forehead
,
Jo
had
copiously
anointed
her
*NL*
afflicted
face
with
cold
cream
,
Beth
had
taken
Joanna
to
bed
with
her
to
*NL*
atone
for
the
approaching
separation
,
and
Amy
had
capped
the
climax
by
*NL*
putting
a
clothes-pin
on
her
nose
,
to
uplift
the
offending
feature
.
It
*NL*
was
one
of
the
kind
artists
use
to
hold
the
paper
on
their
*NL*
drawing-boards
,
therefore
quite
appropriate
and
effective
for
the
*NL*
purpose
to
which
it
was
now
put
.
This
funny
spectacle
appeared
to
amuse
*NL*
the
sun
,
for
he
burst
out
with
such
radiance
that
Jo
woke
up
,
and
*NL*
roused
all
her
sisters
by
a
hearty
laugh
at
Amy
's
ornament
.

Sunshine
and
laughter
were
good
omens
for
a
pleasure
party
,
and
soon
a
*NL*
lively
bustle
began
in
both
houses
.
Beth
,
who
was
ready
first
,
kept
*NL*
reporting
what
went
on
next
door
,
and
enlivened
her
sisters
'
toilets
by
*NL*
frequent
telegrams
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
goes
the
man
with
the
tent
!
I
see
Mrs.
Barker
doing
up
the
lunch
*NL*
in
a
hamper
and
a
great
basket
.
Now
Mr.
Laurence
is
looking
up
at
the
*NL*
sky
,
and
the
weathercock
;
I
wish
he
would
go
,
too
.
There
's
Laurie
,
*NL*
looking
like
a
sailor
,
--
nice
boy
!
Oh
,
mercy
me
!
here
's
a
carriage
full
*NL*
of
people
--
a
tall
lady
,
a
little
girl
,
and
two
dreadful
boys
.
One
is
*NL*
lame
;
poor
thing
,
he
's
got
a
crutch
.
Laurie
did
n't
tell
us
that
.
Be
*NL*
quick
,
girls
!
it
's
getting
late
.
Why
,
there
is
Ned
Moffat
,
I
do
declare
.
*NL*
Look
,
Meg
,
is
n't
that
the
man
who
bowed
to
you
one
day
,
when
we
were
*NL*
shopping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
is
.
How
queer
that
he
should
come
.
I
thought
he
was
at
the
*NL*
Mountains
.
There
is
Sallie
;
I
'm
glad
she
got
back
in
time
.
Am
I
all
*NL*
right
,
Jo
?
''
cried
Meg
,
in
a
flutter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
regular
daisy
.
Hold
up
your
dress
and
put
your
hat
straight
;
it
looks
*NL*
sentimental
tipped
that
way
,
and
will
fly
off
at
the
first
puff
.
Now
,
*NL*
then
,
come
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Jo
,
you
are
not
going
to
wear
that
awful
hat
?
It
's
too
absurd
!
You
*NL*
shall
_
not
_
make
a
guy
of
yourself
,
''
remonstrated
Meg
,
as
Jo
tied
down
,
*NL*
with
a
red
ribbon
,
the
broad-brimmed
,
old-fashioned
Leghorn
Laurie
had
*NL*
sent
for
a
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
will
,
though
,
for
it
's
capital
,
--
so
shady
,
light
,
and
big
.
It
*NL*
will
make
fun
;
and
I
do
n't
mind
being
a
guy
if
I
'm
comfortable
.
''
With
*NL*
that
Jo
marched
straight
away
,
and
the
rest
followed
,
--
a
bright
little
*NL*
band
of
sisters
,
all
looking
their
best
,
in
summer
suits
,
with
happy
*NL*
faces
under
the
jaunty
hat-brims
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
ran
to
meet
,
and
present
them
to
his
friends
,
in
the
most
cordial
*NL*
manner
.
The
lawn
was
the
reception-room
,
and
for
several
minutes
a
*NL*
lively
scene
was
enacted
there
.
Meg
was
grateful
to
see
that
Miss
Kate
,
*NL*
though
twenty
,
was
dressed
with
a
simplicity
which
American
girls
would
*NL*
do
well
to
imitate
;
and
she
was
much
flattered
by
Mr.
Ned
's
assurances
*NL*
that
he
came
especially
to
see
her
.
Jo
understood
why
Laurie
``
primmed
up
*NL*
his
mouth
''
when
speaking
of
Kate
,
for
that
young
lady
had
a
*NL*
stand-off-don
`
t-touch-me
air
,
which
contrasted
strongly
with
the
free
*NL*
and
easy
demeanor
of
the
other
girls
.
Beth
took
an
observation
of
the
*NL*
new
boys
,
and
decided
that
the
lame
one
was
not
``
dreadful
,
''
but
gentle
*NL*
and
feeble
,
and
she
would
be
kind
to
him
on
that
account
.
Amy
found
*NL*
Grace
a
well-mannered
,
merry
little
person
;
and
after
staring
dumbly
at
*NL*
one
another
for
a
few
minutes
,
they
suddenly
became
very
good
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tents
,
lunch
,
and
croquet
utensils
having
been
sent
on
beforehand
,
the
*NL*
party
was
soon
embarked
,
and
the
two
boats
pushed
off
together
,
leaving
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
waving
his
hat
on
the
shore
.
Laurie
and
Jo
rowed
one
boat
;
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
and
Ned
the
other
;
while
Fred
Vaughn
,
the
riotous
twin
,
did
*NL*
his
best
to
upset
both
by
paddling
about
in
a
wherry
like
a
disturbed
*NL*
water-bug
.
Jo
's
funny
hat
deserved
a
vote
of
thanks
,
for
it
was
of
*NL*
general
utility
;
it
broke
the
ice
in
the
beginning
,
by
producing
a
*NL*
laugh
;
it
created
quite
a
refreshing
breeze
,
flapping
to
and
fro
,
as
she
*NL*
rowed
,
and
would
make
an
excellent
umbrella
for
the
whole
party
,
if
a
*NL*
shower
came
up
,
she
said
.
Kate
looked
rather
amazed
at
Jo
's
proceedings
,
*NL*
especially
as
she
exclaimed
``
Christopher
Columbus
!
''
when
she
lost
her
*NL*
oar
;
and
Laurie
said
,
``
My
dear
fellow
,
did
I
hurt
you
?
''
when
he
tripped
*NL*
over
her
feet
in
taking
his
place
.
But
after
putting
up
her
glass
to
*NL*
examine
the
queer
girl
several
times
,
Miss
Kate
decided
that
she
was
*NL*
``
odd
,
but
rather
clever
,
''
and
smiled
upon
her
from
afar
.

Meg
,
in
the

boat
,
was
delightfully
situated
,
face
to
face
with
the
*NL*
rowers
,
who
both
admired
the
prospect
,
and
feathered
their
oars
with
*NL*
uncommon
``
skill
and
dexterity
.
''
Mr.
Brooke
was
a
grave
,
silent
young
*NL*
man
,
with
handsome
brown
eyes
and
a
pleasant
voice
.
Meg
liked
his
quiet
*NL*
manners
,
and
considered
him
a
walking
encyclopaedia
of
useful
knowledge
.
*NL*
He
never
talked
to
her
much
;
but
he
looked
at
her
a
good
deal
,
and
she
*NL*
felt
sure
that
he
did
not
regard
her
with
aversion
.
Ned
,
being
in
*NL*
college
,
of
course
put
on
all
the
airs
which
Freshmen
think
it
their
*NL*
bounden
duty
to
assume
;
he
was
not
very
wise
,
but
very
good-natured
,
and
*NL*
altogether
an
excellent
person
to
carry
on
a
picnic
.
Sallie
Gardiner
was
*NL*
absorbed
in
keeping
her
white
pique
dress
clean
,
and
chattering
with
the
*NL*
ubiquitous
Fred
,
who
kept
Beth
in
constant
terror
by
his
pranks
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
far
to
Longmeadow
;
but
the
tent
was
pitched
and
the
wickets
*NL*
down
by
the
time
they
arrived
.
A
pleasant
green
field
,
with
three
*NL*
wide-spreading
oaks
in
the
middle
,
and
a
smooth
strip
of
turf
for
*NL*
croquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Welcome
to
Camp
Laurence
!
''
said
the
young
host
,
as
they
landed
,
with
*NL*
exclamations
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brooke
is
commander-in-chief
;
I
am
commissary-general
;
the
other
*NL*
fellows
are
staff-officers

you

ladies
,
are
company

The
tent
is
*NL*
for
your
especial
benefit
,
and
that
oak
is
your
drawing-room
;
this
is
*NL*
the
mess-room
,
and
the
third
is
the
camp-kitchen
.
Now
,
let
's
have
a
game
*NL*
before
it
gets
hot
,
and
then
we
'll
see
about
dinner

''
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
,
Beth
,
Amy
,
and
Grace
sat
down
to
watch
the
game
played
by
the
*NL*
other
eight
.
Mr.
Brooke
chose
Meg
,
Kate
,
and
Fred
;
Laurie
took
Sallie
,
*NL*
Jo
,
and
Ned
.
The
Englishers
played
well
;
but
the
Americans
played
*NL*
better
,
and
contested
every
inch
of
the
ground
as
strongly
as
if
the
*NL*
spirit
of
'76
inspired
them
.
Jo
and
Fred
had
several
skirmishes
,
and
*NL*
once
narrowly
escaped
high
words
.
Jo
was
through
the
last
wicket
,
and
*NL*
had
missed
the
stroke
,
which
failure
ruffled
her
a
good
deal
.
Fred
was
*NL*
close
behind
her
,
and
his
turn
came
before
hers
;
he
gave
a
stroke
,
his
*NL*
ball
hit
the
wicket
,
and
stopped
an
inch
on
the
wrong
side
.
No
one
was
*NL*
very
near
;
and
running
up
to
examine
,
he
gave
it
a
sly
nudge
with
his
*NL*
toe
,
which
put
it
just
an
inch
on
the
right
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
through
!
Now
,
Miss
Jo
,
I
'll
settle
you
,

in

the
young

,
swinging
his
mallet
for
another
blow
.

angrily
.

``

croqueting
her

far
away

*NL*
Jo
opened
her

a

hammering
down
a
wicket

with
all
her
might
,
while
Fred
hit
the
stake
,
and
declared
himself
out
*NL*
with
much
exultation

She
went
off
to
get
her
ball
,
and
was
a
long
time
*NL*
finding
it
,
among
the
bushes
;
but
she
came
back
,
looking
cool
and
quiet
,
*NL*
and
waited
her
turn
patiently
.
It
took
several
strokes
to
regain
the
*NL*
place
she
had
lost
;
and
,
when
she
got
there
,
the
other

had
nearly

for
Kate

was
the
last

one

lay
near
the

*NL*

drew
near
to

the

made

she
*NL*
added
,
as

leaving

untouched
,
she
won
the
game
by
a

stroke

*NL*
Laurie
threw
up
his
hat
;
then
remembered
that
it
would

do
to
exult
*NL*
over
the
defeat
of
his
guests
,
and
stopped
in
the
middle
of
a
cheer
to
*NL*
whisper
to
his
friend
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

Meg
drew
her
aside

under
pretence

Jo
,
biting
her
lips
,
as
she
*NL*
glowered
at
Fred
from
under
her
big
hat

*NL*
*NL*
``

Mr.

looking

So
Jo
,
feeling
that
*NL*
her
late
lessons
in
cookery
were
to
do
her
honor
,
went
to
preside
over
*NL*
the
coffee-pot
,
while
the
children
collected
dry
sticks
,
and
the
boys
*NL*
made
a
fire
,
and
got
water
from
a
spring
near
by
.
Miss
Kate
sketched
,
*NL*
and
Frank
talked
to
Beth
,
who
was
making
little
mats
of
braided
rushes
*NL*
to
serve
as
plates

*NL*
*NL*
The
commander-in-chief
and
his
aids
soon
spread
the
table-cloth
with
an
*NL*
inviting
array
of
eatables
and
drinkables
,
prettily
decorated
with
green
*NL*
leaves
.
Jo
announced
that
the
coffee
was
ready
,
and
every
one
settled
*NL*
themselves
to
a
hearty
meal
;
for
youth
is
seldom
dyspeptic
,
and
exercise
*NL*
develops
wholesome
appetites
.
A
very
merry
lunch
it
was
;
for
everything
*NL*
seemed
fresh
and
funny
,
and
frequent
peals
of
laughter
startled
a
*NL*
venerable
horse
who
fed
near
by
.
There
was
a
pleasing
inequality
in
the
*NL*
table
,
which
produced
many
mishaps
to
cups
and
plates
;
acorns
dropped
*NL*
into
the
milk
,
little
black
ants
partook
of
the
refreshments
without
*NL*
being
invited
,
and
fuzzy
caterpillars
swung
down
from
the
tree
,
to
see
*NL*
what
was
going
on
.
Three
white-headed
children
peeped
over
the
fence
,
*NL*
and
an
objectionable
dog
barked
at
them
from
the
other
side

all
his

Once
on
a
time
,
a
knight
went
out
into
the
world
to
seek
his
fortune
,
*NL*
for
he
had
nothing
but
his
sword
and
his
shield
.
He
travelled
a
long
*NL*
while
,
nearly
eight-and-twenty
years
,
and
had
a
hard
time
of
it
,
till
he
*NL*
came
to
the
palace
of
a
good
old
king
,
who
had
offered
a
reward
to
any
*NL*
one
who
would
tame
and
train
a
fine
but
unbroken
colt
,
of
which
he
was
*NL*
very
fond
.
The
knight
agreed
to
try
,
and
got
on
slowly
but
surely
;
for
*NL*
the
colt
was
a
gallant
fellow
,
and
soon
learned
to
love
his
new
master
,
*NL*
though
he
was
freakish
and
wild
.
Every
day
,
when
he
gave
his
lessons
to
*NL*
this
pet
of
the
king
's
,
the
knight
rode
him
through
the
city
;
and
,
as
*NL*
he
rode
,
he
looked
everywhere
for
a
certain
beautiful
face
,
which
he
had
*NL*
seen
many
times
in
his
dreams
,
but
never
found
.
One
day
,
as
he
went
*NL*
prancing
down
a
quiet
street
,
he
saw
at
the
window
of
a
ruinous
castle
*NL*
the
lovely
face
.
He
was
delighted
,
inquired
who
lived
in
this
old
*NL*
castle
,
and
was
told
that
several
captive
princesses
were
kept
there
by
*NL*
a
spell
,
and
spun
all
day
to
lay
up
money
to
buy
their
liberty
.
The
*NL*
knight
wished
intensely
that
he
could
free
them
;
but
he
was
poor
,
and
*NL*
could
only
go
by
each
day
,
watching
for
the
sweet
face
,
and
longing
to
*NL*
see
it
out
in
the
sunshine
.
At
last
,
he
resolved
to
get
into
the
castle
*NL*
and
ask
how
he
could
help
them
.
He
went
and
knocked
;
the
great
door
flew

open

scuttled

down

Oh

cried
Sallie
,
as
Fred
ended
his
*NL*
rigmarole
,
in
which
he
had
jumbled
together
,
pell-mell
,
nautical
phrases
*NL*
and
facts
,
out
of
one
of
his
favorite
books
.
``
Well
they
went
to
the
*NL*
bottom
,
and
a
nice
mermaid
welcomed
them
,
but
was
much
grieved
on
*NL*
finding
the
box
of
headless
knights
,
and
kindly
pickled
them
in
brine
,
*NL*
hoping
to
discover
the
mystery
about
them
;
for
,
being
a
woman
,
she
was
*NL*
curious
.
By
and
by
a
diver
came
down
,
and
the
mermaid
said
,
`
I
'll
give
*NL*
you
this
box
of
pearls
if
you
can
take
it
up
;
'
for
she
wanted
to
restore
*NL*
the
poor
things
to
life
,
and
could
n't
raise
the
heavy
load
herself
.
So
*NL*
the
diver
hoisted
it
up
,
and
was
much
disappointed
,
on
opening
it
,
to
*NL*
find
no
pearls
.
He
left
it
in
a
great
lonely
field
,
where
it
was
found
*NL*
by
a

``
Little

said
*NL*
Amy
,
when
Sallie
's
invention
gave
out
.
``
The
little
girl
was
sorry
for
*NL*
them
,
and
asked
an
old
woman
what
she
should
do
to
help
them
.
`
Your
*NL*
geese
will
tell
you
,
they
know
everything
,
'
said
the
old
woman
.
So
she
*NL*
asked
what
she
should
use
for
new
heads
,
since
the
old
ones
were
lost
,
*NL*
and
all
the
geese
opened
their
hundred
mouths
and
screamed

*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Cabbages

'
''
continued
Laurie
promptly
.
''
`
Just
the
thing
,
'
said
the
*NL*
girl
,
and
ran
to
get
twelve
fine
ones
from
her
garden
.
She
put
them
on
,
*NL*
the
knights
revived
at
once
,
thanked
her
,
and
went
on
their
way
*NL*
rejoicing
,
never
knowing
the
difference
,
for
there
were
so
many
other
*NL*
heads
like
them
in
the
world
that
no
one
thought
anything
of
it
.
The
*NL*
knight
in
whom
I
'm
interested
went
back
to
find
the
pretty
face
,
and
*NL*
learned
that
the
princesses
had
spun
themselves
free
,
and
all
gone
to
be
*NL*
married
,
but
one
.
He
was
in
a
great
state
of
mind
at
that
;
and
mounting
*NL*
the
colt
,
who
stood
by
him
through
thick
and
thin
,
rushed
to
the
castle
*NL*
to
see
which
was
left
.
Peeping
over
the
hedge
,
he
saw
the
queen
of
his
*NL*
affections
picking
flowers
in
her
garden
.
`
Will
you
give
me
a
rose
?
'
*NL*
said
he
.
`
You
must
come
and
get
it
.
I
ca
n't
come
to
you
;
it
is
n't
*NL*
proper
,
'
said
she
,
as
sweet
as
honey
.
He
tried
to
climb
over
the
hedge
,
*NL*
but
it
seemed
to
grow
higher
and
higher
;
then
he
tried
to
push
through
,
*NL*
but
it
grew
thicker
and
thicker
,
and
he
was
in
despair
.
So
he
patiently
*NL*
broke
twig
after
twig
,
till
he
had
made
a
little
hole
,
through
which
he
*NL*
peeped
,
saying
imploringly
,
`
Let
me
in
!
let
me
in
!
'
But
the
pretty
*NL*
princess
did
not
seem
to
understand
,
for
she
picked
her
roses
quietly
,
*NL*
and
left
him
to
fight
his
way
in
.
Whether
he
did
or
not

will
tell

out

*NL*
``
You

you
to
learn

Miss

strolled
away
,
*NL*
adding
to
herself
,
with
a
shrug
,

an
annoyed

have
rather
a

Mr.

looked
so
contented

cheerful

Meg
was
ashamed

lament
her
hard

*NL*
*NL*
``

glad

of
satisfaction
out
of
it

I

I

said
Mr.

busily
punching
holes
in
the
*NL*
turf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
to
college

I

Meg
's
lips
asked
that
question
,
but
her

eyes
added
,
``
And
what
becomes
of
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

exclaimed
Meg

sorrowfully

Mr.

rather
bitterly

as
he
absently
put
the
dead
rose
in
*NL*
the
hole
he

made

covered
it
up

*NL*

heartily

*NL*
``
Thank

began
Mr.

looking
cheerful
*NL*
again
;
but
before
he
could
finish
his
speech
,
Ned
,
mounted
on
the
old
*NL*
horse
,
came
lumbering
up
to
display
his
equestrian
skill
before
the
*NL*
young
ladies
,
and
there
was
no
more
quiet
that
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

you
love

asked
Grace
of
Amy
,
as
they
stood
resting
,
*NL*
after
a
race
round
the
field
with
the
others
,
led
by
Ned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dote
upon
it

laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see

Jo
is
crazy
about
horses

and
so
am
I
,
but
we
've
only
got
*NL*
an
old
side-saddle
,
and
no
horse
.
Out
in
our
garden
is
an
apple-tree
,
*NL*
that
has
a
nice
low
branch
;
so
Jo
put
the
saddle
on
it

fixed
some
reins
*NL*
on

turns
up

bounce
away
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
funny

laughed
Grace
.
``
I
have
a
pony
at

and
ride
nearly
*NL*
every
day

park

with

;
it
's
very
nice

for
my

full
of

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
shall
go
abroad
some
day

I

rather

to
Rome

the

said
Amy
,
who
had
not
the
remotest
idea
what
*NL*
the
Row
was
,
and
would
n't
have
asked
for
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Frank
,
sitting
just
behind
the
little
girls
,
heard
what
they
were
*NL*
saying
,
and
pushed
his
crutch
away
from
him
with
an
impatient
gesture
as
*NL*
he
watched
the
active
lads
going
through
all
sorts
of
comical
*NL*
gymnastics
.
Beth
,
who
was
collecting
the
scattered
Author-cards
,
looked
*NL*
up
,
and
said
,
in
her
shy
yet
friendly
way
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid

are
tired

can
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Talk
to
me

it
's
dull

answered
Frank
,
who
*NL*
had
evidently
been
used
to
being
made
much
of
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
he
had
asked
her
to
deliver
a
Latin
oration
,
it
would
not
have
seemed
*NL*
a
more
impossible
task
to
bashful
Beth
;
but
there
was
no
place
to
run
*NL*
to
,
no
Jo
to
hide
behind
now
,
and
the
poor
boy
looked
so
wistfully
at
*NL*
her
,
that
she
bravely
resolved
to
try
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
like
to
talk
about

''
she
asked
,
fumbling
over
the
cards
,
*NL*
and
dropping
half
as
she
tried
to
tie
them
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
to
hear
about
cricket
and
boating

hunting

said
*NL*
Frank
,
who
had
not

learned
to
suit
his
amusements
to
his
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
heart
!
what
shall
I
do

I

thought
*NL*
Beth
;
and
,
forgetting
the
boy
's
misfortune
in
her
flurry
,
she
said
,
*NL*
hoping
to
make
him
talk
,
``
I
never

all
about

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
once
;

I
can
never

I
got
hurt
leaping
a

confounded
five-barred
gate
;
so
there

no
more
horses

hounds
for
*NL*
me

said
Frank
,
with
a
sigh
that
made
Beth
hate
herself
for
her
*NL*
innocent
blunder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
deer
are
much
prettier
than
our
ugly
buffaloes

she
said
,
turning
*NL*
to
the
prairies
for
help
,
and
feeling
glad
that
she
had
read
one
of
the
*NL*
boys
'
books
in
which
Jo
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Buffaloes
proved
soothing
and
satisfactory
;
and
,
in
her
eagerness
to
*NL*
amuse
another
,
Beth
forgot
herself
,
and
was
quite
unconscious
of
her
*NL*
sisters
'
surprise
and
delight
at
the
unusual
spectacle
of
Beth
talking
*NL*
away
to
one
of
the
dreadful
boys
,
against
whom
she
had
begged
*NL*
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
her
heart
!
She
pities
him
,
so
she
is
good
to
him

said
Jo
,
*NL*
beaming
at
her
from
the
croquet-ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
said
she
was
a
little
saint
,
''
added
Meg
,
as
if
there
could
be
*NL*
no
further
doubt
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
heard
Frank
laugh
so
much
for
ever
so
long

said
Grace
to
*NL*
Amy
,
as
they
sat
discussing
dolls
,
and
making
tea-sets
out
of
the
*NL*
acorn-cups
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
sister
Beth
is
a
very
_
fastidious
_
girl
,
when
she
likes
to
be
,
''
said
*NL*
Amy
,
well
pleased
at
Beth
's
success
.
She
meant
``
fascinating
,
''
but
as
*NL*
Grace
did
n't
know
the
exact
meaning
of
either
word
,
``
fastidious
''
sounded
*NL*
well
,
and
made
a
good
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
impromptu
circus
,
fox
and
geese
,
and
an
amicable
game
of
croquet
,
*NL*
finished
the
afternoon
.
At
sunset
the
tent
was
struck
,
hampers
packed
,
*NL*
wickets
pulled
up
,
boats
loaded
,
and
the
whole
party
floated
down
the
*NL*
river
,
singing
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
.
Ned
,
getting
sentimental
,
*NL*
warbled
a
serenade
with
the
pensive
refrain
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Alone
,
alone
,
ah
!
woe
,
alone
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
at
the
lines
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
each
are
young
,
we
each
have
a
heart
,
*NL*
Oh
,
why
should
we
stand
thus
coldly
apart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
he
looked
at
Meg
with
such
a
lackadaisical
expression
that
she
laughed
*NL*
outright
and
spoilt
his
song
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
be
so
cruel
to
me
?
''
he
whispered
,
under
cover
of
a
lively
*NL*
chorus
.
``
You
've
kept
close
to
that
starched-up
Englishwoman
all
day
,
and
*NL*
now
you
snub
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
mean
to
;
but
you
looked
so
funny
I
really
could
n't
help
it
,
''
*NL*
replied
Meg
,
passing
over
the
first
part
of
his
reproach
;
for
it
was
*NL*
quite
true
that
she
_
had
_
shunned
him
,
remembering
the
Moffat
party
and
*NL*
the
talk
after
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ned
was
offended
,
and
turned
to
Sallie
for
consolation
,
saying
to
her
*NL*
rather
pettishly
,
``
There
is
n't
a
bit
of
flirt
in
that
girl
,
is
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
particle
;
but
she
's
a
dear
,
''
returned
Sallie
,
defending
her
*NL*
friend
even
while
confessing
her
short-comings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
not
a
stricken
deer
,
any
way
,
''
said
Ned
,
trying
to
be
witty
,
and
*NL*
succeeding
as
well
as
very
young
gentlemen
usually
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
lawn
,
where
it
had
gathered
,
the
little
party
separated
with
*NL*
cordial
good-nights
and
good-byes
,
for
the
Vaughns
were
going
to
Canada
.
*NL*
As
the
four
sisters
went
home
through
the
garden
,
Miss
Kate
looked
after
*NL*
them
,
saying
,
without
the
patronizing
tone
in
her
voice
,
``
In
spite
of
*NL*
their
demonstrative
manners

American
girls
are
very
nice

*NL*

``

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
lay
luxuriously
swinging
to
and
fro
in
his
hammock
,
one
warm
*NL*
September
afternoon
,
wondering
what
his
neighbors
were
about
,
but
too
*NL*
lazy
to
go
and
find
out
.
He
was
in
one
of
his
moods
;
for
the
day
had
*NL*
been
both
unprofitable
and
unsatisfactory
,
and
he
was
wishing
he
could
*NL*
live
it
over
again
.
The
hot
weather
made
him
indolent
,
and
he
had
*NL*
shirked
his
studies
,
tried
Mr.
Brooke
's
patience
to
the
utmost
,
*NL*
displeased
his
grandfather
by
practising
half
the
afternoon
,
frightened
*NL*
the
maid-servants
half
out
of
their
wits
,
by
mischievously
hinting
that
*NL*
one
of
his
dogs
was
going
mad
,
and
,
after
high
words
with
the
stable-man
*NL*
about
some
fancied
neglect
of
his
horse
,
he
had
flung
himself
into
his
*NL*
hammock
,
to
fume
over
the
stupidity
of
the
world
in
general
,
till
the
*NL*
peace
of
the
lovely
day
quieted
him
in
spite
of
himself
.
Staring
up
into
*NL*
the
green
gloom
of
the
horse-chestnut
trees
above
him
,
he
dreamed
dreams
*NL*
of
all
sorts
,
and
was
just
imagining
himself
tossing
on
the
ocean
,
in
a
*NL*
voyage
round
the
world
,
when
the
sound
of
voices
brought
him
ashore
in
a
*NL*
flash
.
Peeping
through
the
meshes
of
the
hammock
,
he
saw
the
Marches
*NL*
coming
out
,
as
if
bound
on
some
expedition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
in
the
world
are
those
girls
about
now
?
''
thought
Laurie
,
opening
*NL*
his
sleepy
eyes
to
take
a
good
look
,
for
there
was
something
rather
*NL*
peculiar
in
the
appearance
of
his
neighbors
.
Each
wore
a
large
,
flapping
*NL*
hat
,
a
brown
linen
pouch
slung
over
one
shoulder
,
and
carried
a
long
*NL*
staff
.
Meg
had
a
cushion
,
Jo
a
book
,
Beth
a
basket
,
and
Amy
a
portfolio
.
*NL*
All
walked
quietly
through
the
garden
,
out
at
the
little
back
gate
,
and
*NL*
began
to
climb
the
hill
that
lay
between
the
house
and
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
cool
!
''
said
Laurie
to
himself
,
``
to
have
a
picnic
and
never
*NL*
ask
me
.
They
ca
n't
be
going
in
the
boat
,
for
they
have
n't
got
the
key
.
*NL*
Perhaps
they
forgot
it
;
I
'll
take
it
to
them
,
and
see
what
's
going
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
possessed
of
half
a
dozen
hats
,
it
took
him
some
time
to
find
*NL*
one
;
then
there
was
a
hunt
for
the
key
,
which
was
at
last
discovered
in
*NL*
his
pocket
;
so
that
the
girls
were
quite
out
of
sight
when
he
leaped
the
*NL*
fence
and
ran
after
them
.
Taking
the
shortest
way
to
the
boat-house
,
he
*NL*
waited
for
them
to
appear
:
but
no
one
came
,
and
he
went
up
the
hill
to
*NL*
take
an
observation
.
A
grove
of
pines
covered
one
part
of
it
,
and
from
*NL*
the
heart
of
this
green
spot
came
a
clearer
sound
than
the
soft
sigh
of
*NL*
the
pines
or
the
drowsy
chirp
of
the
crickets
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's

thought
Laurie
,
peeping
through
the
bushes
,
and
*NL*
looking
wide-awake
and
good-natured
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
_
was
_
rather
a
pretty
little
picture
;
for
the
sisters
sat
together
in
*NL*
the
shady
nook
,
with
sun
and
shadow
flickering
over
them
,
the
aromatic
*NL*
wind
lifting
their
hair
and
cooling
their
hot
cheeks
,
and
all
the
little
*NL*
wood-people
going
on
with
their
affairs
as
if
these
were
no
strangers
,
*NL*
but
old
friends
.
Meg
sat
upon
her
cushion
,
sewing
daintily
with
her
*NL*
white
hands
,
and
looking
as
fresh
and
sweet
as
a
rose
,
in
her
pink
*NL*
dress
,
among
the
green
.
Beth
was
sorting
the
cones
that
lay
thick
under
*NL*
the
hemlock
near
by
,
for
she
made
pretty
things
of
them
.
Amy
was
*NL*
sketching
a
group
of
ferns
,
and
Jo
was
knitting
as
she
read
aloud
.
A
*NL*
shadow
passed
over
the
boy
's
face
as
he
watched
them
,
feeling
that
he
*NL*
ought
to
go
away
,
because
uninvited
;
yet
lingering
,
because
home
seemed
*NL*
very
lonely
,
and
this
quiet
party
in
the
woods
most
attractive
to
his
*NL*
restless
spirit
.
He
stood
so
still
that
a
squirrel
,
busy
with
its
*NL*
harvesting
,
ran
down
a
pine
close
beside
him
,
saw
him
suddenly
and
*NL*
skipped
back
,
scolding
so
shrilly
that
Beth
looked
up
,
espied
the
*NL*
wistful
face
behind
the
birches
,
and
beckoned
with
a
reassuring
smile
.

he
asked

advancing

slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
lifted
her
eyebrows
,
but
Jo
scowled
at
her
defiantly
,
and
said
,
at
*NL*
once
,
``
Of

you
may

We

have
asked

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

no

Meg
,
gravely

graciously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much

I
'll
do
anything

*NL*
dull
as

down

Laurie
sat
down
,

with
a
submissive
expression

to
behold

*NL*
``
Finish

Jo
,
handing
him
the
book

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

was
the
meek
answer
,
as
he
began
,
doing
his
best
to
prove
his
*NL*
gratitude
for
the
favor
of
an
admission
into
the

*NL*
*NL*
The
story
was
not
a
long
one
,
and
,
when

was
finished
,
he
ventured
to
*NL*
ask
a
few
questions
as
a
reward
of
merit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please

I

*NL*
*NL*

Would

of

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

wisely

Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

did

wanted

was
rather
dismal
.
He
did

said
Laurie
,
as
Jo
became
absorbed
in
her
work
,
looking
*NL*
a
trifle
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
n't
she
tell
you
about
this
new
plan

ours
?
Well

we
have
*NL*
tried
not
to
waste
our
holiday
,
but
each
has
had
a
task
,
and
worked
at
*NL*
it
with
a
will
.
The
vacation
is
nearly
over
,
the
stints
are
all
done
,
*NL*
and
we
are
ever
so
glad
that
we
did
n't
dawdle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
should
think
so
;
''
and
Laurie
thought
regretfully
of
his
own
idle
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
likes
to
have
us
out
of
doors
as
much
as
possible
;
so
we
bring
*NL*
our
work
here
,
and
have
nice
times
.
For
the
fun
of
it
we
bring
our
*NL*
things
in
these
bags
,
wear
the
old
hats
,
use
poles
to
climb
the
hill
,
*NL*
and
play
pilgrims
,
as
we
used
to
do
years
ago
.
We
call
this
hill
the
*NL*
`
Delectable
Mountain
,
'
for
we
can
look
far
away
and
see
the
country
*NL*
where
we
hope
to
live
some
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
pointed
,
and
Laurie
sat
up
to
examine
;
for
through
an
opening
in
the
*NL*
wood
one
could
look
across
the
wide
,
blue
river
,
the
meadows
on
the
*NL*
other
side
,
far
over
the
outskirts
of
the
great
city
,
to
the
green
hills
*NL*
that
rose
to
meet
the
sky
.
The
sun
was
low
,
and
the
heavens
plowed
with
*NL*
the
splendor
of
an
autumn
sunset
.
Gold
and
purple
clouds
lay
on
the
*NL*
hill-tops
;
and
rising
high
into
the
ruddy
light
were
silvery
white
*NL*
peaks
,
that
shone
like
the
airy
spires
of
some
Celestial
City
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
beautiful
that
is
!
''
said
Laurie
softly
,
for
he
was
quick
to
see
and
*NL*
feel
beauty
of
any
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
often
so
;
and
we
like
to
watch
it
,
for
it
is
never
the
same
,

*NL*
always
splendid

replied
Amy
,
wishing
she
could
paint
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
talks
about
the
country
where
we
hope
to
live
some
time
,
--
the
real
*NL*
country
,
she
means
,
with
pigs
and
chickens
,
and
haymaking
.
It
would
be
*NL*
nice
,
but
I
wish
the
beautiful
country
up
there
was
real
,

we
could
*NL*
ever
go
to
it

Beth
musingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

enough

answered
Meg
,
with
her
sweet
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
so
long

those
swallows
fly

go
in
at

splendid
gate

*NL*
``
You
'll
get
there

sooner

*NL*
``
You
'll
have
me

deal

*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
boy
's
face
troubled
his
little
friend
;
but
she
said
*NL*
cheerfully
,
with
her
quiet
eyes
on
the
changing
clouds
,
``
If
people

really
want
to
go

in

I
do

believe
there
are
any
locks
on

door

or
any
guards
*NL*
at

I
always
imagine
it

shining
ones
stretch
out
their

up

*NL*
``
Would

it

Jo
,
after
a
little
pause
.

Margaret
seemed
to
find

a

waved
a
brake

before
her
face

as
if
to
disperse
imaginary
gnats

slowly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
and
see
if
it
does
n't
bring
you
something
worth
having

''
replied
*NL*
the
boy
,
laughing
at
the
thought
of
a
charming
little
secret
which
he
*NL*
fancied
he
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
colored
behind
the
brake
,
but
asked
no
questions
,
and
looked
across
*NL*
the
river
with
the
same
expectant
expression
which
Mr.
Brooke
had
worn
*NL*
when
he
told
the
story
of
the
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
we
are
all
alive
ten
years
hence
,
let

meet
,
and
see
how
many
of
us
*NL*
have
got
our
wishes
,
or
how
much
nearer
we
are
then
than
now

said
Jo
,
*NL*
always
ready
with
a
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
!
how
old
I
shall
be
,

twenty-seven
!
''
exclaimed
Meg
who
felt
*NL*
grown
up
already
,
having
just
reached
seventeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
and
I
shall
be
twenty-six
,
Teddy
,
Beth
twenty-four
,
and
Amy
*NL*
twenty-two

What
a
venerable
party
!

said
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
shall
have
done
something
to
be
proud
of
by
that
time

I
'm
*NL*
such
a
lazy
dog

I
'm
afraid
I
shall

dawdle

Jo

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
a
motive

when
you
get
it
,
she
is
sure
you
'll
*NL*
work
splendidly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she

By
Jupiter
I
will

cried
Laurie
,
*NL*
sitting
up
with
sudden
energy
.
``
I
ought
to
be
satisfied

I
do
try
,
but
it
's
working
against
the
grain
,
you
see

*NL*

comes
hard

He
wants
me
to
be
an
India
merchant
,
as
he
was
,
and
I
'd
*NL*
rather
be
shot
.
I
hate
tea

silk

spices

every

his

bring
,

I
do

care
how
soon
they
go
to
the

bottom

I
own
them

Going
to
college
ought

satisfy
him
,
for
if

give
him
four
years
he
ought

let
me
off

he

to
do

*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
spoke
excitedly
,
and
looked
ready
to
carry
his
threat
into
*NL*
execution
on
the
slightest
provocation
;
for
he
was
growing
up
very
fast
,
*NL*
and
,
in
spite
of
his
indolent
ways
,
had
a
young
man
's
hatred
of
*NL*
subjection
,
a
young
man
's
restless
longing
to
try
the
world
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
advise
you
to
sail
away

tried

said
Jo
,
whose
imagination
was
*NL*
fired
by
the
thought
of
such
a
daring
exploit

whose
sympathy
was

excited
by
what
she
called

*NL*
``

take
your
bad

You
should
do
just
what
your

said
Meg
,
in
her
most
maternal
tone

your

sure
he

there
is
no

*NL*
``
What

asked
Laurie

grateful
for
the
good
*NL*
advice

but
objecting
to
the
lecture
,
and
glad
to
turn
the
conversation
*NL*
from
himself
,
after
his
unusual
outbreak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
what
your

told
us
about

how
he
took
good

she
died

would
n't
go
abroad
as
tutor
to
some
nice

person

because
he
would
n't
leave
her
;
and
how
he
provides
now
for
an
*NL*
old
woman
who
nursed
his
mother
;
and
never
tells
any
one
,
but
is
just
as

generous

patient

good
as
he
can
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
he

heartily

as
Meg
paused
,
*NL*
looking
flushed
and
earnest
with
her
story

``
It
's
like

to
find

out
all
about

letting
him
know

tell
all
his

goodness

so
kind

asking
him
over
with

treating

in

He
thought
she
was
just

perfect
,
and
talked
about
it
for
days

days
,

went
on
about
you

all
in
flaming
style

If
ever

replied
Laurie
,
with
his

high

as

called
a
certain
expression

he
occasionally
wore

And

Meg
offered
her
hand
with
a
gesture
both
affectionate
and
timid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ashamed
of
his
momentary
pique
,
Laurie
squeezed
the
kind
little
hand
,
*NL*
and
said
frankly
,
``
I

the

out

*NL*
*NL*
Bent
on
showing
that
he
was
not
offended

he
made
himself
as
agreeable
*NL*
as
possible
,
--
wound
cotton
for
Meg
,
recited
poetry
to
please
Jo
,
shook
*NL*
down
cones
for
Beth

and
helped
Amy
with
her
ferns
,
proving
himself
a
*NL*
fit
person
to
belong
to
the
``
Busy
Bee

In
the
midst
of
an
*NL*
animated
discussion
on
the
domestic
habits
of
turtles
-LRB-
one
of
those
*NL*
amiable
creatures
having
strolled
up
from
the
river
-RRB-
,
the
faint
sound
of
*NL*
a
bell
warned
them
that
Hannah
had
put
the
tea
``
to
draw
,
''
and
they
would
*NL*
just
have
time
to
get
home
to
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May

come
again

asked
Laurie

a
demand
for

just

added
Jo
,
waving
hers
,
like
a
big
*NL*
blue
worsted
banner
,
as
they
parted
at
the
gate

*NL*
*NL*
That
night
,
when
Beth
played
to
Mr.
Laurence
in
the
twilight
,
Laurie
,
*NL*
standing
in
the
shadow
of
the
curtain
,
listened
to
the
little
David
,
*NL*
whose
simple
music
always
quieted
his
moody
spirit
,
and
watched
the
old
*NL*
man
,
who
sat
with
his
gray
head
on
his
hand
,
thinking
tender
thoughts
of
*NL*
the
dead
child
he
had
loved
so
much

Remembering
the
conversation
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
the

said
to
himself

with
the
resolve
to
make
the
*NL*
sacrifice
cheerfully
,
``
I
'll

SECRETS

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
was
very
busy
in
the
garret
,
for
the
October
days
began
to
grow
*NL*
chilly
,
and
the
afternoons
were
short
.
For
two
or
three
hours
the
sun
*NL*
lay
warmly
in
the
high
window
,
showing
Jo
seated
on
the
old
sofa
,
*NL*
writing
busily
,
with
her
papers
spread
out
upon
a
trunk
before
her
,
*NL*
while
Scrabble
,
the
pet
rat
,
promenaded
the
beams
overhead
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
his
oldest
son
,
a
fine
young
fellow
,
who
was
evidently
very
proud
of
*NL*
his
whiskers
.
Quite
absorbed
in
her
work
,
Jo
scribbled
away
till
the
*NL*
last
page
was
filled
,
when
she
signed
her
name
with
a
flourish
,
and
*NL*
threw
down
her
pen
,
exclaiming
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
I
've
done
my
best
!
If
this
wo
n't
suit
I
shall
have
to
wait
till
*NL*
I
can
do
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lying
back
on
the
sofa
,
she
read
the
manuscript
carefully
through
,
*NL*
making
dashes
here
and
there
,
and
putting
in
many
exclamation
points
,
*NL*
which
looked
like
little
balloons
;
then
she
tied
it
up
with
a
smart
red
*NL*
ribbon
,
and
sat
a
minute
looking
at
it
with
a
sober
,
wistful
expression
,
*NL*
which
plainly
showed
how
earnest
her
work
had
been
.
Jo
's
desk
up
here
*NL*
was
an
old
tin
kitchen
,
which
hung
against
the
wall
.
In
it
she
kept
her
*NL*
papers
and
a
few
books
,
safely
shut
away
from
Scrabble
,
who
,
being
*NL*
likewise
of
a
literary
turn
,
was
fond
of
making
a
circulating
library
of
*NL*
such
books
as
were
left
in
his
way
,
by
eating
the
leaves
.
From
this
tin
*NL*
receptacle
Jo
produced
another
manuscript
;
and
,
putting
both
in
her
*NL*
pocket
,
crept
quietly
down
stairs
,
leaving
her
friends
to
nibble
her
*NL*
pens
and
taste
her
ink
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
put
on
her
hat
and
jacket
as
noiselessly
as
possible
,
and
,
going
to
*NL*
the
back
entry
window
,
got
out
upon
the
roof
of
a
low
porch
,
swung
*NL*
herself
down
to
the
grassy
bank
,
and
took
a
roundabout
way
to
the
road
.
*NL*
Once
there
,
she
composed
herself
,
hailed
a
passing
omnibus
,
and
rolled
*NL*
away
to
town
,
looking
very
merry
and
mysterious
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
any
one
had
been
watching
her
,
he
would
have
thought
her
movements
*NL*
decidedly
peculiar
;
for
,
on
alighting
,
she
went
off
at
a
great
pace
till
*NL*
she
reached
a
certain
number
in
a
certain
busy
street
;
having
found
the
*NL*
place
with
some
difficulty
,
she
went
into
the
doorway
,
looked
up
the
*NL*
dirty
stairs
,
and
,
after
standing
stock
still
a
minute
,
suddenly
dived
*NL*
into
the
street
,
and
walked
away
as
rapidly
as
she
came
.
This
*NL*
manoeuvre
she
repeated
several
times
,
to
the
great
amusement
of
a
*NL*
black-eyed
young
gentleman
lounging
in
the
window
of
a
building
*NL*
opposite
.
On
returning
for
the
third
time
,
Jo
gave
herself
a
shake
,
*NL*
pulled
her
hat
over
her
eyes
,
and
walked
up
the
stairs
,
looking
as
if
*NL*
she
were
going
to
have
all
her
teeth
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
dentist
's
sign
,
among
others
,
which
adorned
the
entrance
,
*NL*
and
,
after
staring
a
moment
at
the
pair
of
artificial
jaws
which
slowly
*NL*
opened
and
shut
to
draw
attention
to
a
fine
set
of
teeth
,
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
put
on
his
coat
,
took
his
hat
,
and
went
down
to
post
himself
*NL*
in
the
opposite
doorway
,
saying
,
with
a
smile
and
a
shiver
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
like
her
to
come
alone
,
but
if
she
has
a
bad
time
she
'll
need
some
*NL*
one
to
help
her
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
ten
minutes
Jo
came
running
down
stairs
with
a
very
red
face
,
and
the
*NL*
general
appearance
of
a
person
who
had
just
passed
through
a
trying
*NL*
ordeal
of
some
sort
.
When
she
saw
the
young
gentleman
she
looked
*NL*
anything
but
pleased
,
and
passed
him
with
a
nod
;
but
he
followed
,
asking
*NL*
with
an
air
of
sympathy
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
have
a
bad
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

you
go
alone

ever
saw

you

*NL*
Jo
looked
at
her
friend
as
if
she
did
not
understand
him
;
then
began
to
*NL*
laugh
,
as
if
mightily
amused
at
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
which
I

come
out

must
wait

up

looking
mystified

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
are
you

What
were
you
doing

up
in

billiard
saloon

*NL*
*NL*
``
Begging
your
pardon

ma'am

it
was

a

I
was
taking

lesson
in
fencing

we
'll
make
a
fine
thing
of
the
fencing
scene

*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
burst
out
with
a
hearty
boy
's
laugh
,
which
made
several
*NL*
passers-by
smile
in
spite
of
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``
No

looking
nettled

*NL*

Laurie
walked
in

Jo
watched

wind
had
taken
liberties
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
till
I
'm
stiff
and
old
,
and
have
to
use
a
crutch
.
Do
n't
try
to
*NL*
make
me
grow
up
before
my
time
,
Meg
:
it
's
hard
enough
to
have
you
change
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
;
let
me
be
a
little
girl
as
long
as
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
Jo
bent
over
the
leaves
to
hide
the
trembling
of
her
lips
;
*NL*
for
lately
she
had
felt
that
Margaret
was
fast
getting
to
be
a
woman
,
*NL*
and
Laurie
's
secret
made
her
dread
the
separation
which
must
surely
come
*NL*
some
time
,
and
now
seemed
very
near
.
He
saw
the
trouble
in
her
face
,
and
*NL*
drew
Meg
's
attention
from
it
by
asking
quickly
,
``
Where
have
you
been
*NL*
calling
,
all
so
fine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
Gardiners
'
,
and
Sallie
has
been
telling
me
all
about
Belle
*NL*
Moffat
's
wedding
.
It
was
very
splendid
,
and
they
have
gone
to
spend
the
*NL*
winter
in
Paris
.
Just
think
how
delightful
that
must
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
envy
her
,
Meg
?
''
said
Laurie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
it
!
''
muttered
Jo
,
tying
on
her
hat
with
a
jerk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
asked
Meg
,
looking
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
if
you
care
much
about
riches
,
you
will
never
go
and
marry
a
*NL*
poor
man
,
''
said
Jo
,
frowning
at
Laurie
,
who
was
mutely
warning
her
to
*NL*
mind
what
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
'
_
go
_
and
marry
'
any
one
,
''
observed
Meg
,
walking
on
with
*NL*
great
dignity
,
while
the
others
followed
,
laughing
,
whispering
,
skipping
*NL*
stones
,
and
``
behaving
like
children
,
''
as
Meg
said
to
herself
,
though
she
*NL*
might
have
been
tempted
to
join
them
if
she
had
not
had
her
best
dress
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
or
two
,
Jo
behaved
so
queerly
that
her
sisters
were
quite
*NL*
bewildered
.
She
rushed
to
the
door
when
the
postman
rang
;
was
rude
to
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
whenever
they
met
;
would
sit
looking
at
Meg
with
a
woe-begone
*NL*
face
,
occasionally
jumping
up
to
shake
,
and
then
to
kiss
her
,
in
a
very
*NL*
mysterious
manner
;
Laurie
and
she
were
always
making
signs
to
one
*NL*
another
,
and
talking
about
``
Spread
Eagles
,
''
till
the
girls
declared
they
*NL*
had
both
lost
their
wits
.
On
the
second
Saturday
after
Jo
got
out
of
the
*NL*
window
,
Meg
,
as
she
sat
sewing
at
her
window
,
was
scandalized
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
Laurie
chasing
Jo
all
over
the
garden
,
and
finally
capturing
*NL*
her
in
Amy
's
bower
.
What
went
on
there
,
Meg
could
not
see
;
but
shrieks
*NL*
of
laughter
were
heard
,
followed
by
the
murmur
of
voices
and
a
great
*NL*
flapping
of
newspapers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
we
do
with
that
girl
?
She
never
_
will
_
behave
like
a
young
*NL*
lady
,
''
sighed
Meg
,
as
she
watched
the
race
with
a
disapproving
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
wo
n't
;
she
is
so
funny
and
dear
as
she
is
,
''
said
Beth
,
who
*NL*
had
never
betrayed
that
she
was
a
little
hurt
at
Jo
's
having
secrets
*NL*
with
any
one
but
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
trying
,
but
we
never
can
make
her
_
commy
la
fo
_
,
''
added
Amy
,
*NL*
who
sat
making
some
new
frills
for
herself
,
with
her
curls
tied
up
in
a
*NL*
very
becoming
way
,
--
two
agreeable
things
,
which
made
her
feel
unusually
*NL*
elegant
and
ladylike
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
Jo
bounced
in
,
laid
herself
on
the
sofa
,
and
affected
*NL*
to
read
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have

anything

''
asked
Meg
,
with
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
a
story
;
wo
n't
amount
to
much
,
I

,
''
returned
Jo
,
*NL*
carefully
keeping
the
name
of
the
paper
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
read
it
aloud
;
that
will
amuse
us
and
keep
you
out
of
*NL*
mischief

''
said
Amy
,
in
her
most
grown-up
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
name
?
''
asked
Beth
,
wondering
why
Jo
kept
her
face
behind
the
*NL*
sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Rival
Painters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sounds
well
;
read
it
,
''
said
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
loud
``
Hem
!
''
and
a
long
breath
,
Jo
began
to
read
very
fast
.
The
*NL*
girls
listened
with
interest
,
for
the
tale
was
romantic
,
and
somewhat
*NL*
pathetic
,
as
most
of
the
characters
died
in
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that
about
the
splendid
picture
,
''
was
Amy
's
approving
remark
,
as
*NL*
Jo
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
prefer
the
lovering
part
.
Viola
and
Angelo
are
two
of
our
favorite
*NL*
names
;
is
n't
that
queer
?
''
said
Meg
,
wiping
her
eyes
,
for
the
``
lovering
*NL*
part
''
was
tragical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
wrote
it
?
''
asked
Beth
,
who
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
Jo
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
suddenly
sat
up
,
cast
away
the
paper
,
displaying
a
flushed
*NL*
countenance
,
and
,
with
a
funny
mixture
of
solemnity
and
excitement
,
*NL*
replied
in
a
loud
voice
,
``
Your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

''
cried
Meg
,
dropping
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

said
Amy
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

O

Jo

I

''
and
Beth
ran
to
hug
*NL*
her
sister
,
and
exult
over
this
splendid
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
me
,
how
delighted
they
all
were
,
to
be
sure
!
how
Meg
would
n't
*NL*
believe
it
till
she
saw
the
words
,
``
Miss
Josephine
March
,
''
actually
*NL*
printed
in
the
paper
;
how
graciously
Amy
criticised
the
artistic
parts
*NL*
of
the
story
,
and
offered
hints
for
a
sequel
,
which
unfortunately
*NL*
could
n't
be
carried
out
,
as
the
hero
and
heroine
were
dead
;
how
Beth
got
*NL*
excited
,
and
skipped
and
sung
with
joy
;
how
Hannah
came
in
to
exclaim
*NL*
``
Sakes
alive
,
well
I
never
!
''
in
great
astonishment
at
``
that
Jo
's
*NL*
doin
's
;
''
how
proud
Mrs.
March
was
when
she
knew
it
;
how
Jo
laughed
,
with
*NL*
tears
in
her
eyes
,
as
she
declared
she
might
as
well
be
a
peacock
and
*NL*
done
with
it
;
and
how
the
``
Spread
Eagle
''
might
be
said
to
flap
his
wings
*NL*
triumphantly
over
the
House
of
March
,
as
the
paper
passed
from
hand
to
*NL*
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell

all
about

''
``
When

How
much

``

``

''
cried
the
family
,
*NL*
all
in
one
breath
,
as
they
clustered
about
Jo
;
for
these
foolish
,
*NL*
affectionate
people
made
a
jubilee
of
every
little
household
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
jabbering
,
girls
,
and
I
'll
tell
you
everything
,
''
said
Jo
,
*NL*
wondering
if
Miss
Burney
felt
any
grander
over
her
``
Evelina
''
than
she
*NL*
did
over
her
``
Rival
Painters
.
''
Having
told
how
she
disposed
of
her
*NL*
tales
,
Jo
added
,
``
And
when
I
went
to
get
my
answer
,
the
man
said
he
*NL*
liked
them
both
,
but
did
n't
pay
beginners
,
only
let
them
print
in
his
*NL*
paper
,
and
noticed
the
stories
.
It
was
good
practice
,
he
said
;
and
when
*NL*
the
beginners
improved
,
any
one
would
pay
.
So
I
let
him
have
the
two
*NL*
stories
,
and
to-day
this
was
sent
to
me
,
and
Laurie
caught
me
with
it
,
*NL*
and
insisted
on
seeing
it
,
so
I
let
him
;
and
he
said
it
was
good
,
and
I
*NL*
shall
write
more
,
and
he
's
going
to
get
the
next
paid
for
,
and
I
_
am
_
so
*NL*
happy
,
for
in
time
I
may
be
able
to
support
myself
and
help
the
girls

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
breath
gave
out
here
;
and
,
wrapping
her
head
in
the
paper
,
she
*NL*
bedewed
her
little
story
with
a
few
natural
tears
;
for
to
be
*NL*
independent
,
and
earn
the
praise
of
those
she
loved
were
the
dearest
*NL*
wishes
of
her
heart
,
and
this
seemed
to
be
the
first
step
toward
that

happy

Margaret

standing
at

one
dull
afternoon

looking
out
at

frost-bitten
garden

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

pensively

quite

unconscious

on

*NL*
*NL*
``

took
a
hopeful
view

even
November
.

*NL*
``
I

said
Meg

who
was
out
of
sorts
.
``
We
go
grubbing
along
day
after

leaned
both

Amy

spatted
away
energetically

Beth

who
sat
at

said

smiling

came

Mrs.

usual
question

Laurie
to

whisked

A

interrupted

in

At
the
word
``
telegraph
,
''
Mrs.
March
snatched
it
,
read
the
two
lines
it
*NL*
contained
,
and
dropped
back
into
her
chair
as
white
as
if
the
little
*NL*
paper
had
sent
a
bullet
to
her
heart
.
Laurie
dashed
down
stairs
for
*NL*
water
,
while
Meg
and
Hannah
supported
her
,
and
Jo
read
aloud
,
in
a
*NL*
frightened
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

How
still
the
room
was
as
they
listened
breathlessly
,
how
strangely
the
*NL*
day
darkened
outside
,
and
how
suddenly
the
whole
world
seemed
to
change
,
*NL*
as
the
girls
gathered
about
their
mother
,
feeling
as
if
all
the
*NL*
happiness
and
support
of
their
lives
was
about
to
be
taken
from
them
.
*NL*
Mrs.
March
was
herself
again
directly
;
read
the
message
over
,
and
*NL*
stretched
out
her
arms
to
her
daughters
,
saying
,
in
a
tone
they
never
*NL*
forgot
,
``
I
shall
go
at
once
,
but
it
may
be
too
late

O
children

*NL*
children
,

me
to
bear
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
several
minutes
there
was
nothing
but
the
sound
of
sobbing
in
the
*NL*
room
,
mingled
with
broken
words
of
comfort
,
tender
assurances
of
help
,
*NL*
and
hopeful
whispers
that
died
away
in
tears
.
Poor
Hannah
was
the
first
*NL*
to
recover
,
and
with
unconscious
wisdom
she
set
all
the
rest
a
good
*NL*
example
;
for
,
with
her
,
work
was
the
panacea
for
most
afflictions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
keep
the

wo
n't
waste
no

,
but

''
she
said
,
heartily
,
as
she
wiped
her
*NL*
face
on
her
apron
,
gave
her
mistress
a
warm
shake
of
the
hand
with
her
*NL*
own
hard
one
,
and
went
away
,
to
work
like
three
women
in
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
tried
to
be
calm
,
poor
things
,
as
their
mother
sat
up
,
looking
*NL*
pale
,
but
steady
,
and
put
away
her
grief
to
think
and
plan
for
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
Laurie
?
''
she
asked
presently
,
when
she
had
collected
her
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
decided
on
the
first
duties
to
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
ma'am
.
Oh
,
let
me
do
something
!
''
cried
the
boy
,
hurrying
from
the
*NL*
next
room
,
whither
he
had
withdrawn
,
feeling
that
their
first
sorrow
was
*NL*
too
sacred
for
even
his
friendly
eyes
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send

*NL*
``
What
else

The
horses

I

he
*NL*
said
,
looking
ready
to
fly
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave

''
*NL*
*NL*
Tearing
off
the
blank
side
of
one
of
her
newly
copied
pages
,
Jo
drew
the
*NL*
table
before
her
mother
,
well
knowing
that
money
for
the
long
,
sad
*NL*
journey
must
be
borrowed
,
and
feeling
as
if
she
could
do
anything
to
add
*NL*
a
little
to
the
sum
for
her
father

*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
's
warning
was
evidently
thrown
away
;
for
five
minutes
later
*NL*
Laurie
tore
by
the
window
on
his
own
fleet
horse
,
riding
as
if
for
his
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Writing
,
thinking
,
and
directing
,
all
at
once
,
might
well
bewilder
the
*NL*
poor
lady
,
and
Meg
begged
her
to
sit
quietly
in
her
room
for
a
little
*NL*
while
,
and
let
them
work
.
Every
one
scattered
like
leaves
before
a
gust
*NL*
of
wind
;
and
the
quiet
,
happy
household
was
broken
up
as
suddenly
as
if
*NL*
the
paper
had
been
an
evil
spell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
came
hurrying
back
with
Beth
,
bringing
every
comfort
the
*NL*
kind
old
gentleman
could
think
of
for
the
invalid
,
and
friendliest
*NL*
promises
of
protection
for
the
girls
during
the
mother
's
absence
,
which
*NL*
comforted
her
very
much
.
There
was
nothing
he
did
n't
offer
,
from
his
own
*NL*
dressing-gown
to
himself
as
escort
.
But
that
last
was
impossible
.
Mrs.
*NL*
March
would
not
hear
of
the
old
gentleman
's
undertaking
the
long
*NL*
journey
;
yet
an
expression
of
relief
was
visible
when
he
spoke
of
it
,
*NL*
for
anxiety
ill
fits
one
for
travelling
.
He
saw
the
look
,
knit
his
heavy
*NL*
eyebrows
,
rubbed
his
hands
,
and
marched
abruptly
away
,
saying
he
'd
be
*NL*
back
directly
.
No
one
had
time
to
think
of
him
again
till
,
as
Meg
ran
*NL*
through
the
entry
,
with
a
pair
of
rubbers
in
one
hand
and
a
cup
of
tea
*NL*
in
the
other
,
she
came
suddenly
upon
Mr.
Brooke
.

``
I

very
sorry

''
he
said
,
in
the
kind
,
*NL*
quiet
tone
which
sounded
very
pleasantly
to
her
perturbed
spirit
.
``
I
*NL*
came

myself

to

Mr.

has

commissions

real
satisfaction
*NL*
to
be
of
service
to
her
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Down
dropped
the
rubbers
,
and
the
tea
was
very
near
following
,
as
Meg
*NL*
put
out
her
hand
,
with
a
face
so
full
of
gratitude
,
that
Mr.
Brooke
*NL*
would
have
felt
repaid
for
a
much
greater
sacrifice
than
the
trifling
*NL*
one
of
time
and
comfort
which
he
was
about
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
you
all
are

Mother
will
accept

I
'm
sure

it
will
be
such
*NL*
a
relief
to
know
that
she
has
some
one
to
take
care
of
her
.
Thank
you
*NL*
very
,
very
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
spoke
earnestly
,
and
forgot
herself
entirely
till
something
in
the
*NL*
brown
eyes
looking
down
at
her
made
her
remember
the
cooling
tea
,
and
*NL*
lead
the
way
into
the
parlor
,
saying
she
would
call
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
arranged
by
the
time
Laurie
returned
with
a
note
from
*NL*
Aunt
March
,
enclosing
the
desired
sum
,
and
a
few
lines
repeating
what
*NL*
she
had
often
said
before
,
--
that
she
had
always
told
them
it
was
absurd
*NL*
for
March
to
go
into
the
army
,
always
predicted
that
no
good
would
come
*NL*
of
it
,
and
she
hoped
they
would
take
her
advice
next
time
.
Mrs.
March
*NL*
put
the
note
in
the
fire
,
the
money
in
her
purse
,
and
went
on
with
her
*NL*
preparations
,
with
her
lips
folded
tightly
,
in
a
way
which
Jo
would
have
*NL*
understood
if
she
had
been
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
short
afternoon
wore
away
;
all
the
other
errands
were
done
,
and
Meg
*NL*
and
her
mother
busy
at
some
necessary
needlework
,
while
Beth
and
Amy
got
*NL*
tea
,
and
Hannah
finished
her
ironing
with
what
she
called
a
``
slap
and
a
*NL*
bang
,
''
but
still
Jo
did
not
come
.
They
began
to
get
anxious
;
and
Laurie
*NL*
went
off
to
find
her
,
for
no
one
ever
knew
what
freak
Jo
might
take
into
*NL*
her
head
.
He
missed
her
,
however
,
and
she
came
walking
in
with
a
very
*NL*
queer
expression
of
countenance
,
for
there
was
a
mixture
of
fun
and
*NL*
fear
,
satisfaction
and
regret
,
in
it
,
which
puzzled
the
family
as
much
*NL*
as
did
the
roll
of
bills
she
laid
before
her
mother
,
saying
,
with
a
*NL*
little
choke
in
her
voice
,
``
That
's
my
contribution
towards
making
*NL*
father
comfortable
and
bringing
him
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
where
did
you
get
it
?
Twenty-five
dollars
!
Jo
,
I
hope
you
*NL*
have
n't
done
anything
rash
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
's
mine
honestly
;
I
did
n't
beg
,
borrow
,
or
steal
it
.
I
earned
it
;
*NL*
and
I
do
n't
think
you
'll
blame
me
,
for
I
only
sold
what
was
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
Jo
took
off
her
bonnet
,
and
a
general
outcry
arose
,
for
*NL*
all
her
abundant
hair
was
cut
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
hair
!
Your
beautiful
hair
!
''
``
O
Jo
,
how
could
you
?
Your
one
*NL*
beauty
.
''
``
My
dear
girl
,
there
was
no
need
of
this
.
''
``
She
does
n't
look
*NL*
like
my
Jo
any
more
,
but
I
love
her
dearly
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
every
one
exclaimed
,
and
Beth
hugged
the
cropped
head
tenderly
,
Jo
*NL*
assumed
an
indifferent
air
,
which
did
not
deceive
any
one
a
particle
,
*NL*
and
said
,
rumpling
up
the
brown
bush
,
and
trying
to
look
as
if
she
liked
*NL*
it
,
``
It
does
n't
affect
the
fate
of
the
nation

so
do
n't
wail

Beth
.
It
*NL*
will
be
good
for
my
vanity
;
I
was
getting
too
proud
of
my
wig
.
It
will
*NL*
do
my
brains
good
to
have
that
mop
taken
off
;
my
head
feels
deliciously
*NL*
light
and
cool
,
and
the
barber
said
I
could
soon
have
a
curly
crop
,
*NL*
which
will
be
boyish
,
becoming
,
and
easy
to
keep
in
order

I
'm
*NL*
satisfied

so
please
take
the
money

have

*NL*
``
Tell

to
your
love

But

my
dear

it
was
not
necessary
,
and
I
'm
afraid
you
*NL*
will
regret
it
,
one
of
these
days

said
Mrs.
March
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
!
''
returned
Jo
stoutly
,
feeling
much
relieved
that
her
prank
*NL*
was
not
entirely
condemned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made
you
do
it
?
''
asked
Amy
,
who
would
as
soon
have
thought
of
*NL*
cutting
off
her
head
as
her
pretty
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
wild
to
do
something
for
father

''
replied
Jo
,
as
they
*NL*
gathered
about
the
table
,
for
healthy
young
people
can
eat
even
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
trouble
.
``
I
hate
to
borrow
as
much
as
mother
does

and
I
knew
*NL*
Aunt
March
would
croak
;
she
always
does
,
if
you
ask
for
a
ninepence
.
Meg
*NL*
gave
all
her
quarterly
salary
toward
the
rent
,
and
I
only
got
some
*NL*
clothes
with
mine
,
so
I
felt
wicked
,
and
was
bound
to
have
some
money
,
*NL*
if
I
sold
the
nose
off
my
face
to
get
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
feel
wicked
,
my
child
:
you
had
no
winter
things
,
and
got
*NL*
the
simplest
with
your
own
hard
earnings
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
with
a
look
*NL*
that
warmed
Jo
's
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
the
least
idea
of
selling
my
hair
at
first
,
but
as
I
went
*NL*
along
I
kept
thinking
what
I
could
do
,
and
feeling
as
if
I
'd
like
to
*NL*
dive
into
some
of
the
rich
stores
and
help
myself
.
In
a
barber
's
window
*NL*
I
saw
tails
of
hair
with
the
prices
marked
;
and
one
black
tail
,
not
so
*NL*
thick
as
mine
,
was
forty
dollars
.
It
came
over
me
all
of
a
sudden
that
I
*NL*
had
one
thing
to
make
money
out
of
,
and
without
stopping
to
think
,
I
*NL*
walked
in
,
asked
if
they
bought
hair
,
and
what
they
would
give
for
*NL*
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
how
you
dared
to
do
it

said
Beth
,
in
a
tone
of
awe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
was
a
little
man
who
looked
as
if
he
merely
lived
to
oil
his
*NL*
hair

He
rather
stared
,
at
first
,
as
if
he
was
n't
used
to
having
girls
*NL*
bounce
into
his
shop
and
ask
him
to
buy
their
hair
.
He
said
he
did
n't
*NL*
care
about
mine
,
it
was
n't
the
fashionable
color
,
and
he
never
paid
much
*NL*
for
it
in
the
first
place
;
the
work
put
into
it
made
it
dear
,
and
so
on
.
*NL*
It
was
getting
late
,
and
I
was
afraid
,
if
it
was
n't
done
right
away

*NL*
that
I
should

it
done
at
all

thing
,
I
hate
to
give
it
up
;
so
I
begged
him
to
take
it
,
and
told
him
*NL*
why
I
was
in
such
a
hurry
.
It
was
silly
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
changed
his
*NL*
mind
,
for
I
got
rather
excited
,
and
told
the
story
in
my
topsy-turvy
*NL*
way
,
and
his
wife
heard
,
and
said
so
kindly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Take
it
,
Thomas
,
and
oblige
the
young
lady

I
'd
do
as
much
for
our
*NL*
Jimmy
any
day

I
had
a
spire
of
hair
worth
selling
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
was
Jimmy

asked
Amy
,
who
liked
to
have
things
explained
as
they
*NL*
went
along
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
son

said

was
in

How
friendly
such
things
make

do
n't
they
?
She
talked
away
all
the

the
man
*NL*
clipped
,
and
diverted
my
mind
nicely

``
Did
n't
you
feel
dreadfully
when
the

asked
Meg
,
with
a
*NL*
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
took
a
last
look
at
my
hair
while
the
man
got
his
things
,

that
*NL*
was
the
end
of
it
.
I
never
snivel
over
trifles
like
that
;
I
will
*NL*
confess
,
though
,
I
felt
queer
when
I
saw
the
dear
old
hair
laid
out
on
*NL*
the
table
,
and
felt
only
the
short
,
rough
ends
on
my
head
.
It
almost
*NL*
seemed
as
if
I
'd
an
arm
or
a
leg
off
.
The
woman
saw
me
look
at
it
,
and
*NL*
picked
out
a
long
lock
for
me
to
keep
.
I
'll
give
it
to
you
,
Marmee
,
just
*NL*
to
remember
past
glories
by

for
a
crop
is
so
comfortable
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
I
shall
ever
have
a
mane
again

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
folded
the
wavy
,
chestnut
lock
,
and
laid
it
away
with
a
short
*NL*
gray
one
in
her
desk
.
She
only
said
``
Thank
you
,
deary
,
''
but
something
in
*NL*
her
face
made
the
girls
change
the
subject
,
and
talk
as
cheerfully
as
*NL*
they
could
about
Mr.
Brooke
's
kindness
,
the
prospect
of
a
fine
day
*NL*
to-morrow
,
and
the
happy
times
they
would
have
when
father
came
home
to
*NL*
be
nursed
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
wanted
to
go
to
bed
,
when
,
at
ten
o'clock
,
Mrs.
March
put
by
the
*NL*
last
finished
job
,
and
said
,
``
Come
,
girls
.
''
Beth
went
to
the
piano
and
*NL*
played
the
father
's
favorite
hymn
;
all
began
bravely
,
but
broke
down
*NL*
one
by
one
,
till
Beth
was
left
alone
,
singing
with
all
her
heart
,
for
to
*NL*
her
music
was
always
a
sweet
consoler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
bed
and
do
n't
talk
,
for
we
must
be
up
early

shall
need
all
*NL*
the
sleep
we
can
get
.
Good-night
,
my
darlings

''
said
Mrs.
March
,
as
the
*NL*
hymn
ended
,
for
no
one
cared
to
try
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
kissed
her
quietly
,
and
went
to
bed
as
silently
as
if
the
dear
*NL*
invalid
lay
in
the
next
room
.
Beth
and
Amy
soon
fell
asleep
in
spite
of
*NL*
the
great
trouble
,
but
Meg
lay
awake
,
thinking
the
most
serious
thoughts
*NL*
she
had
ever
known
in
her
short
life
.
Jo
lay
motionless
,
and
her
sister
*NL*
fancied
that
she
was
asleep
,
till
a
stifled
sob
made
her
exclaim
,
as
she
*NL*
touched
a
wet
cheek
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
dear
,
what
is
it
?
Are
you
crying
about
father
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

not
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
--
my
hair
!
''
burst
out
poor
Jo
,
trying
vainly
to
smother
her
emotion
*NL*
in
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
sound
at
all
comical
to
Meg
,
who
kissed
and
caressed
the
*NL*
afflicted
heroine
in
the
tenderest
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
sorry
,
''
protested
Jo
,
with
a
choke
.
``
I
'd
do
it
again
to-morrow
,
*NL*
if
I
could
.
It
's
only
the
vain

selfish
part
of
me
that
goes
and
cries
*NL*
in
this
silly
way
.
Do
n't
tell
any
one
,
it
's
all
over
now
.
I
thought
you
*NL*
were
asleep
,
so
I
just
made
a
little
private
moan
for
my
one
beauty
.
How
*NL*
came
you
to
be
awake
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
sleep
,
I
'm
so
anxious
,
''
said
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Think
about
something
pleasant
,
and
you
'll
soon
drop
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tried
it
,
but
felt
wider
awake
than
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
you
think
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
faces
,
--
eyes
particularly
,
''
answered
Meg
,
smiling
to
herself
,
*NL*
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
color
do
you
like
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brown
--
that
is
,
sometimes
;
blue
are
lovely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
laughed
,
and
Meg
sharply
ordered
her
not
to
talk
,
then
amiably
*NL*
promised
to
make
her
hair
curl
,
and
fell
asleep
to
dream
of
living
in
*NL*
her
castle
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clocks
were
striking
midnight
,
and
the
rooms
were
very
still
,
as
a
*NL*
figure
glided
quietly
from
bed
to
bed
,
smoothing
a
coverlid
here
,
*NL*
settling
a
pillow
there
,
and
pausing
to
look
long
and
tenderly
at
each
*NL*
unconscious
face
,
to
kiss
each
with
lips
that
mutely
blessed
,
and
to
*NL*
pray
the
fervent
prayers
which
only
mothers
utter
.
As
she
lifted
the
*NL*
curtain
to
look
out
into
the
dreary
night
,
the
moon
broke
suddenly
from
*NL*
behind
the
clouds
,
and
shone
upon
her
like
a
bright
,
benignant
face
,
*NL*
which
seemed
to
whisper
in
the
silence
,
``
Be
comforted
,
dear
soul
!
There
*NL*
is
always
light
behind
the
clouds
.

In
the
cold
gray
dawn
the
sisters
lit
their
lamp
,
and
read
their
chapter
*NL*
with
an
earnestness
never
felt
before
;
for
now
the
shadow
of
a
real
*NL*
trouble
had
come
,
the
little
books
were
full
of
help
and
comfort
;
and
,
*NL*
as
they
dressed
,
they
agreed
to
say
good-by
cheerfully
and
hopefully
,
*NL*
and
send
their
mother
on
her
anxious
journey
unsaddened
by
tears
or
*NL*
complaints
from
them
.
Everything
seemed
very
strange
when
they
went
*NL*
down
,
--
so
dim
and
still
outside
,
so
full
of
light
and
bustle
within
.
*NL*
Breakfast
at
that
early
hour
seemed
odd
,
and
even
Hannah
's
familiar
face
*NL*
looked
unnatural
as
she
flew
about
her
kitchen
with
her
night-cap
on
.
*NL*
The
big
trunk
stood
ready
in
the
hall
,
mother
's
cloak
and
bonnet
lay
on
*NL*
the
sofa
,
and
mother
herself
sat
trying
to
eat
,
but
looking
so
pale
and
*NL*
worn
with
sleeplessness
and
anxiety
that
the
girls
found
it
very
hard
to
*NL*
keep
their
resolution
.
Meg
's
eyes
kept
filling
in
spite
of
herself
;
Jo
*NL*
was
obliged
to
hide
her
face
in
the
kitchen
roller
more
than
once
;
and
*NL*
the
little
girls
'
wore
a
grave
,
troubled
expression
,
as
if
sorrow
was
a
*NL*
new
experience
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
talked
much
,
but
as
the
time
drew
very
near
,
and
they
sat
waiting
*NL*
for
the
carriage
,
Mrs.
March
said
to
the
girls
,
who
were
all
busied
*NL*
about
her
,
one
folding
her
shawl
,
another
smoothing
out
the
strings
of
*NL*
her
bonnet
,
a
third
putting
on
her
overshoes
,
and
a
fourth
fastening
up
*NL*
her
travelling
bag
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

n't
grieve

fret

being
idle

The
rattle
of
an
approaching
carriage
made
them
all
start
and
listen
.
*NL*
That
was
the
hard
minute
,
but
the
girls
stood
it
well
:
no
one
cried
,
no
*NL*
one
ran
away
or
uttered
a
lamentation
,
though
their
hearts
were
very
*NL*
heavy
as
they
sent
loving
messages
to
father
,
remembering
,
as
they
*NL*
spoke
,
that
it
might
be
too
late
to
deliver
them
.
They
kissed
their
*NL*
mother
quietly
,
clung
about
her
tenderly
,
and
tried
to
wave
their
hands
*NL*
cheerfully
when
she
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
and
his
grandfather
came
over
to
see
her
off
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
*NL*
looked
so
strong
and
sensible
and
kind
that
the
girls
christened
him
*NL*
``
Mr.
Greatheart
''
on
the
spot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
my
darlings
!
God
bless
and
keep
us
all
!

whispered
Mrs.
March
,
*NL*
as
she
kissed
one
dear
little
face
after
the
other
,
and
hurried
into
the
*NL*
carriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
rolled
away
,
the
sun
came
out
,
and
,
looking
back
,
she
saw
it
*NL*
shining
on
the
group
at
the
gate
,
like
a
good
omen
.
They
saw
it
also
,
*NL*
and
smiled
and
waved
their
hands
;
and
the
last
thing
she
beheld
,
as
she
*NL*
turned
the
corner
,
was
the
four
bright
faces
,
and
behind
them
,
like
a
*NL*
body-guard
,
old
Mr.
Laurence
,
faithful
Hannah
,
and
devoted
Laurie
.

*NL*
``

she
said
,
turning
to
find
fresh
proof
of
*NL*
it
in
the
respectful
sympathy
of
the
young
man
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

returned
Mr.

,
laughing
so
*NL*
infectiously
that
Mrs.
March
could
not
help
smiling
;
and
so
the
long
*NL*
journey
began
with
the
good
omens
of
sunshine
,
smiles
,
and
cheerful
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Jo
,
as
their
neighbors

went
home
to
breakfast

leaving
them
to
rest
and
refresh
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

as

added
Meg
forlornly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
opened
her
lips
to
say
something
,
but
could
only
point
to
the
pile
*NL*
of
nicely-mended
hose
which
lay
on
mother
's
table
,
showing
that
even
in
*NL*
her
last
hurried
moments
she
had
thought
and
worked
for
them
.
It
was
a
*NL*
little
thing
,
but
it
went
straight
to
their
hearts
;
and
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
their
brave
resolutions
,
they
all
broke
down
,
and
cried
bitterly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hannah
wisely
allowed
them
to
relieve
their
feelings
,
and
,
when
the
*NL*
shower
showed
signs
of
clearing
up
,
she
came
to
the
rescue
,
armed
with
a
*NL*
coffee-pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

*NL*
Coffee
was
a
treat
,
and
Hannah
showed
great
tact
in
making
it
that
*NL*
morning
.
No
one
could
resist
her
persuasive
nods
,
or
the
fragrant
*NL*
invitation
issuing
from
the
nose
of
the
coffee-pot
.
They
drew
up
to
the
*NL*
table
,
exchanged
their
handkerchiefs
for
napkins
,
and
in
ten
minutes
*NL*
were
all
right
again

''

see

remember
it
best

Jo

as
she
sipped
with
returning
spirit
.

``

so
red

*NL*
``

in

with
an
important
air

without

and
felt
better
for
it
,
though
Meg
*NL*
shook
her
head
at
the
young

could
find
consolation
in
a

The
sight
of
the
turn-overs
made
Jo
sober
again
;
and
when
the
two
went
*NL*
out
to
their
daily
tasks
,
they
looked
sorrowfully
back
at
the
window
*NL*
where
they
were
accustomed
to
see
their
mother
's
face
.
It
was
gone
;
but
*NL*
Beth
had
remembered
the
little
household
ceremony
,
and
there
she
was
,
*NL*
nodding
away
at
them
like
a
rosy-faced
mandarin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
so
like
my

''
said
Jo
,
waving
her
hat
,
with
a
grateful
face
.
*NL*
``
Good-by

she
added

*NL*

returned
Meg
,
trying
not
to
smile
at
the
*NL*
curly
head
,
which
looked
comically
small
on
her
tall
sister

shoulders

went

*NL*
News
from
their
father
comforted
the
girls
very
much
;
for
,
though
*NL*
dangerously
ill
,
the
presence
of
the
best
and
tenderest
of
nurses
had
*NL*
already
done
him
good
.
Mr.
Brooke
sent
a
bulletin
every
day
,
and
,
as
the
*NL*
head
of
the
family
,
Meg
insisted
on
reading
the
despatches
,
which
grew
*NL*
more
and
more
cheering
as
the
week
passed
.
At
first
,
every
one
was
eager
*NL*
to
write
,
and
plump
envelopes
were
carefully
poked
into
the
letter-box
*NL*
by
one
or
other
of
the
sisters
,
who
felt
rather
important
with
their
*NL*
Washington
correspondence
.
As
one
of
these
packets
contained
*NL*
characteristic
notes
from
the
party
,
we
will
rob
an
imaginary
mail
,
and
*NL*
read
them
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
DEAREST
MOTHER
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
impossible
to
tell
you
how
happy
your
last
letter
made
*NL*
us
,
for
the
news
was
so
good
we
could
n't
help
laughing
and
*NL*
crying
over
it
.
How
very
kind
Mr.
Brooke
is
,
and
how
fortunate
*NL*
that
Mr.
Laurence
's
business
detains
him
near
you
so
long
,
*NL*
since
he
is
so
useful
to
you
and
father
.
The
girls
are
all
as
*NL*
good
as
gold
.
Jo
helps
me
with
the
sewing
,
and
insists
on
doing
*NL*
all
sorts
of
hard
jobs
.
I
should
be
afraid
she
might
overdo
,
if
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
that
her
`
moral
fit
'
would
n't
last
long
.
Beth
is
*NL*
as
regular
about
her
tasks
as
a
clock
,
and
never
forgets
what
*NL*
you
told
her
.
She
grieves
about
father
,
and
looks
sober
except
*NL*
when
she
is
at
her
little
piano
.
Amy
minds
me
nicely
,
and
I
*NL*
take
great
care
of
her
.
She
does
her
own
hair
,
and
I
am
*NL*
teaching
her
to
make
button-holes
and
mend
her
stockings
.
She
*NL*
tries
very
hard
,
and
I
know
you
will
be
pleased
with
her
*NL*
improvement
when
you
come
.
Mr.
Laurence
watches
over
us
like
a
*NL*
motherly
old
hen
,
as
Jo
says
;
and
Laurie
is
very
kind
and
*NL*
neighborly
.
He
and
Jo
keep
us
merry
,
for
we
get
pretty
blue
*NL*
sometimes
,
and
feel
like
orphans
,
with
you
so
far
away
.
Hannah
*NL*
is
a
perfect
saint
;
she
does
not
scold
at
all
,
and
always
calls
*NL*
me
Miss
`
Margaret
,
'
which
is
quite
proper
,
you
know
,
and
treats
*NL*
me
with
respect
.
We
are
all
well
and
busy
;
but
we
long
,
day
*NL*
and
night
,
to
have
you
back
.
Give
my
dearest
love
to
father
,
*NL*
and
believe
me
,
ever
your
own
*NL*
``
MEG

*NL*
*NL*
This
note
,
prettily
written
on
scented
paper
,
was
a
great
contrast
to
*NL*
the
next
,
which
was
scribbled
on
a
big
sheet
of
thin
foreign
paper
,
*NL*
ornamented
with
blots
and
all
manner
of
flourishes
and
curly-tailed
*NL*
letters
:

Three
cheers
for
dear
father
!
Brooke
was
a
trump
to
telegraph
*NL*
right
off
,
and
let
us
know
the
minute
he
was
better
.
I
rushed
*NL*
up
garret
when
the
letter
came
,
and
tried
to
thank
God
for
*NL*
being
so
good
to
us
;
but
I
could
only
cry
,
and
say
,
`
I
'm
glad
!
*NL*
I
'm
glad
!
'
Did
n't
that
do
as
well
as
a
regular
prayer
?
for
I
*NL*
felt
a
great
many
in
my
heart
.
We
have
such
funny
times
;
and
*NL*
now
I
can
enjoy
them
,
for
every
one
is
so
desperately
good
,
*NL*
it
's
like
living
in
a
nest
of
turtle-doves
.
You
'd
laugh
to
see
*NL*
Meg
head
the
table
and
try
to
be
motherish
.
She
gets
prettier
*NL*
every
day
,
and
I
'm
in
love
with
her
sometimes
.
The
children
are
*NL*
regular
archangels
,
and
I
--
well
,
I
'm
Jo
,
and
never
shall
be
*NL*
anything
else
.
Oh
,
I
must
tell
you
that
I
came
near
having
a
*NL*
quarrel
with
Laurie
.
I
freed
my
mind
about
a
silly
little
*NL*
thing
,
and
he
was
offended
.
I
was
right
,
but
did
n't
speak
as
I
*NL*
ought
,
and
he
marched
home
,
saying
he
would
n't
come
again
till
*NL*
I
begged
pardon
.
I
declared
I
would
n't
,
and
got
mad
.
It
lasted
*NL*
all
day
;
I
felt
bad
,
and
wanted
you
very
much
.
Laurie
and
I
are
*NL*
both
so
proud
,
it
's
hard
to
beg
pardon
;
but
I
thought
he
'd
come
*NL*
to
it
,
for
I
_
was
_
in
the
right
.
He
did
n't
come
;
and
just
at
*NL*
night
I
remembered
what
you
said
when
Amy
fell
into
the
river
.
*NL*
I
read
my
little
book
,
felt
better
,
resolved
not
to
let
the
sun
*NL*
set
on
_
my
_
anger
,
and
ran
over
to
tell
Laurie
I
was
sorry
.
I
*NL*
met
him
at
the
gate
,
coming
for
the
same
thing
.
We
both
*NL*
laughed
,
begged
each
other
's
pardon
,
and
felt
all
good
and
*NL*
comfortable
again
.

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
week
the
amount
of
virtue
in
the
old
house
would
have
supplied
the
*NL*
neighborhood
.
It
was
really
amazing
,
for
every
one
seemed
in
a
heavenly
*NL*
frame
of
mind
,
and
self-denial
was
all
the
fashion
.
Relieved
of
their
*NL*
first
anxiety
about
their
father
,
the
girls
insensibly
relaxed
their
*NL*
praiseworthy
efforts
a
little
,
and
began
to
fall
back
into
the
old
ways
.
*NL*
They
did
not
forget
their
motto
,
but
hoping
and
keeping
busy
seemed
to
*NL*
grow
easier
;
and
after
such
tremendous
exertions
,
they
felt
that
*NL*
Endeavor
deserved
a
holiday
,
and
gave
it
a
good
many
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
caught
a
bad
cold
through
neglect
to
cover
the
shorn
head
enough
,
and
*NL*
was
ordered
to
stay
at
home
till
she
was
better
,
for
Aunt
March
did
n't
*NL*
like
to
hear
people
read
with
colds
in
their
heads
.
Jo
liked
this
,
and
*NL*
after
an
energetic
rummage
from
garret
to
cellar
,
subsided
on
the
sofa
*NL*
to
nurse
her
cold
with
arsenicum
and
books
.
Amy
found
that
housework
and
*NL*
art
did
not
go
well
together
,
and
returned
to
her
mud
pies
.
Meg
went
*NL*
daily
to
her
pupils
,
and
sewed
,
or
thought
she
did
,
at
home
,
but
much
*NL*
time
was
spent
in
writing
long
letters
to
her
mother
,
or
reading
the
*NL*
Washington
despatches
over
and
over
.
Beth
kept
on
,
with
only
slight
*NL*
relapses
into
idleness
or
grieving
.
All
the
little
duties
were
*NL*
faithfully
done
each
day
,
and
many
of
her
sisters
'
also
,
for
they
were
*NL*
forgetful
,
and
the
house
seemed
like
a
clock
whose
pendulum
was
gone
*NL*
a-visiting
.
When
her
heart
got
heavy
with
longings
for
mother
or
fears
*NL*
for
father
,
she
went
away
into
a
certain
closet
,
hid
her
face
in
the
*NL*
folds
of
a
certain
dear
old
gown
,
and
made
her
little
moan
and
prayed
*NL*
her
little
prayer
quietly
by
herself
.
Nobody
knew
what
cheered
her
up
*NL*
after
a
sober
fit
,
but
every
one
felt
how
sweet
and
helpful
Beth
was
,
*NL*
and
fell
into
a
way
of
going
to
her
for
comfort
or
advice
in
their
small
*NL*
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
were
unconscious
that
this
experience
was
a
test
of
character
;
and
,
*NL*
when
the
first
excitement
was
over
,
felt
that
they
had
done
well
,
and
*NL*
deserved
praise
.
So
they
did
;
but
their
mistake
was
in
ceasing
to
do
*NL*
well
,
and
they
learned
this
lesson
through
much
anxiety
and
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meg
,
I
wish
you
'd
go
and
see
the
Hummels
;
you
know
mother
told
us
not
*NL*
to
forget
them
,
''
said
Beth
,
ten
days
after
Mrs.
March
's
departure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
too
tired
to
go
this
afternoon
,
''
replied
Meg
,
rocking
comfortably
*NL*
as
she
sewed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
,
Jo
?
''
asked
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
stormy
for
me
with
my
cold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
it
was
almost
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
well
enough
for
me
to
go
out
with
Laurie
,
but
not
well
enough
to
*NL*
go
to
the
Hummels
'
,
''
said
Jo
,
laughing
,
but
looking
a
little
ashamed
of
*NL*
her
inconsistency
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
go
yourself
?
''
asked
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
have
_
been
every
day
,
but
the
baby
is
sick
,
and
I
do
n't
know
what
to
*NL*
do
for
it
.
Mrs.
Hummel
goes
away
to
work
,
and
Lottchen
takes
care
of
it
;
*NL*
but
it
gets
sicker
and
sicker
,
and
I
think
you
or
Hannah
ought
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
spoke
earnestly
,
and
Meg
promised
she
would
go
to-morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
Hannah
for
some
nice
little
mess
,
and
take
it
round
,
Beth
;
the
air
*NL*
will
do
you
good
,
''
said
Jo
,
adding
apologetically
,
``
I
'd
go
,
but
I
want
*NL*
to
finish
my
writing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
head
aches
and
I
'm
tired
,
so
I
thought
may
be
some
of
you
would
go
,
''
*NL*
said
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amy
will
be
in
presently
,
and
she
will
run
down
for
us
,
''
suggested
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
rest
a
little
and
wait
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Beth
lay
down
on
the
sofa
,
the
others
returned
to
their
work
,
and
the
*NL*
Hummels
were
forgotten
.
An
hour
passed
:
Amy
did
not
come
;
Meg
went
to
*NL*
her
room
to
try
on
a
new
dress
;
Jo
was
absorbed
in
her
story
,
and
Hannah
*NL*
was
sound
asleep
before
the
kitchen
fire
,
when
Beth
quietly
put
on
her
*NL*
hood
,
filled
her
basket
with
odds
and
ends
for
the
poor
children
,
and
*NL*
went
out
into
the
chilly
air
,
with
a
heavy
head
,
and
a
grieved
look
in
*NL*
her
patient
eyes
.
It
was
late
when
she
came
back
,
and
no
one
saw
her
*NL*
creep
upstairs
and
shut
herself
into
her
mother
's
room
.
Half
an
hour
*NL*
after
Jo
went
to
``
mother
's
closet
''
for
something
,
and
there
found
Beth
*NL*
sitting
on
the
medicine
chest
,
looking
very
grave
,
with
red
eyes
,
and
a
*NL*
camphor-bottle
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christopher
Columbus
!
What
's
the
matter
?
''
cried
Jo
,
as
Beth
put
out
her
*NL*
hand
as
if
to
warn
her
off
,
and
asked
quickly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
had
the
scarlet
fever
,
have
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Year
's
ago
,
when
Meg
did
.
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
tell
you
.
Oh
,
Jo
,
the
baby
's
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
baby
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Hummel
's
;
it
died
in
my
lap
before
she
got
home
,
''
cried
Beth
,
with
*NL*
a
sob
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
dear
,
how
dreadful
for
you
!
I
ought
to
have
gone
,
''
said
Jo
,
*NL*
taking
her
sister
in
her
arms
as
she
sat
down
in
her
mother
's
big
chair
,
*NL*
with
a
remorseful
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
dreadful
,
Jo
,
only
so
sad
!
I
saw
in
a
minute
that
it
was
*NL*
sicker
,
but
Lottchen
said
her
mother
had
gone
for
a
doctor
,
so
I
took
*NL*
baby
and
let
Lotty
rest
.
It
seemed
asleep
,
but
all
of
a
sudden
it
gave
a
*NL*
little
cry
,
and
trembled
,
and
then
lay
very
still
.
I
tried
to
warm
its
*NL*
feet
,
and
Lotty
gave
it
some
milk
,
but
it
did
n't
stir
,
and
I
knew
it
was
*NL*
dead
.

It
did
n't
stir
,
and
I
knew

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
cry
,
dear
!
What
did
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
sat
and
held
it
softly
till
Mrs.
Hummel
came
with
the
doctor
.
He
*NL*
said
it
was
dead
,
and
looked
at
Heinrich
and
Minna
,
who
have
got
sore
*NL*
throats
.
`
Scarlet
fever
,
ma'am
.
Ought
to
have
called
me
before
,
'
he
said
*NL*
crossly
.
Mrs.
Hummel
told
him
she
was
poor
,
and
had
tried
to
cure
baby
*NL*
herself
,
but
now
it
was
too
late
,
and
she
could
only
ask
him
so
help
the
*NL*
others
,
and
trust
to
charity
for
his
pay
.
He
smiled
then
,
and
was
*NL*
kinder
;
but
it
was
very
sad
,
and
I
cried
with
them
till
he
turned
round
,
*NL*
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
told
me
to
go
home
and
take
belladonna
right
away
,
*NL*
or
I
'd
have
the
fever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
wo
n't
!
''
cried
Jo
,
hugging
her
close
,
with
a
frightened
look
.
``
O
*NL*
Beth
,
if
you
should
be
sick
I
never
could
forgive
myself
!
What
_
shall
_
*NL*
we
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
frightened
,
I
guess
I
sha
n't
have
it
badly
.
I
looked
in
*NL*
mother
's
book
,
and
saw
that
it
begins
with
headache
,
sore
throat
,
and
*NL*
queer
feelings
like
mine
,
so
I
did
take
some
belladonna
,
and
I
feel
*NL*
better
,
''
said
Beth
,
laying
her
cold
hands
on
her
hot
forehead
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
look
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
mother
was
only
at
home
!
''
exclaimed
Jo
,
seizing
the
book
,
and
*NL*
feeling
that
Washington
was
an
immense
way
off
.
She
read
a
page
,
looked
*NL*
at
Beth
,
felt
her
head
,
peeped
into
her
throat
,
and
then
said
gravely
;
*NL*
``
You
've
been
over
the
baby
every
day
for
more
than
a
week
,
and
among
the
*NL*
others
who
are
going
to
have
it
;
so
I
'm
afraid
_
you
_
are
going
to
have
*NL*
it
,
Beth
.
I
'll
call
Hannah
,
she
knows
all
about
sickness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
Amy
come
;
she
never
had
it
,
and
I
should
hate
to
give
it
to
*NL*
her
.
Ca
n't
you
and
Meg
have
it
over
again
?
''
asked
Beth
,
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
not
;
do
n't
care
if
I
do
;
serve
me
right
,
selfish
pig
,
to
let
*NL*
you
go
,
and
stay
writing
rubbish
myself
!
''
muttered
Jo
,
as
she
went
to
*NL*
consult
Hannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
soul
was
wide
awake
in
a
minute
,
and
took
the
lead
at
once
,
*NL*
assuring
Jo
that
there
was
no
need
to
worry
;
every
one
had
scarlet
*NL*
fever
,
and
,
if
rightly
treated
,
nobody
died
,
--
all
of
which
Jo
believed
,
*NL*
and
felt
much
relieved
as
they
went
up
to
call
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'll
tell
you
what
we
'll
do
,
''
said
Hannah
,
when
she
had
examined
*NL*
and
questioned
Beth
;
``
we
will
have
Dr.
Bangs
,
just
to
take
a
look
at
*NL*
you
,
dear
,
and
see
that
we
start
right
;
then
we
'll
send
Amy
off
to
Aunt
*NL*
March
's
,
for
a
spell
,
to
keep
her
out
of
harm
's
way
,
and
one
of
you
*NL*
girls
can
stay
at
home
and
amuse
Beth
for
a
day
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
stay
,
of
course
;
I
'm
oldest
,
''
began
Meg
,
looking
anxious
and
*NL*
self-reproachful
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
shall
,
because
it
's
my
fault
she
is
sick
;
I
told
mother
I
'd
do
the
*NL*
errands
,
and
I
have
n't
,
''
said
Jo
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
will
you
have
,
Beth
?
there
ai
n't
no
need
of
but
one
,
''
said
*NL*
Hannah
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
please
;
''
and
Beth
leaned
her
head
against
her
sister
,
with
a
*NL*
contented
look
,
which
effectually
settled
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
and
tell
Amy
,
''
said
Meg
,
feeling
a
little
hurt
,
yet
rather
*NL*
relieved
,
on
the
whole
,
for
she
did
not
like
nursing
,
and
Jo
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
rebelled
outright
,
and
passionately
declared
that
she
had
rather
*NL*
have
the
fever
than
go
to
Aunt
March
.
Meg
reasoned
,
pleaded
,
and
*NL*
commanded
:
all
in
vain
.
Amy
protested
that
she
would
_
not
_
go
;
and
Meg
*NL*
left
her
in
despair
,
to
ask
Hannah
what
should
be
done
.
Before
she
came
*NL*
back
,
Laurie
walked
into
the
parlor
to
find
Amy
sobbing
,
with
her
head
*NL*
in
the
sofa-cushions
.
She
told
her
story
,
expecting
to
be
consoled
;
but
*NL*
Laurie
only
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
walked
about
the
room
,
*NL*
whistling
softly
,
as
he
knit
his
brows
in
deep
thought
.
Presently
he
sat
*NL*
down
beside
her
,
and
said
,
in
his
most
wheedlesome
tone
,
``
Now
be
a
*NL*
sensible
little
woman
,
and
do
as
they
say
.
No
,
do
n't
cry
,
but
hear
what
*NL*
a
jolly
plan
I
've
got
.
You
go
to
Aunt
March
's
,
and
I
'll
come
and
take
*NL*
you
out
every
day
,
driving
or
walking
,
and
we
'll
have
capital
times
.
*NL*
Wo
n't
that
be
better
than
moping
here
?

``
I
do

began
Amy
,
in
an
*NL*
injured
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
your

it

well

sick

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I

sure
I
do

I
dare
say
I
shall
be
,
for
I

been
with
*NL*
Beth
all
the
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
very
reason
you
ought
to
go
away
at
once

so
that
you
may

escape
it

Change
of
air
and
care
will
keep
you
well

I
dare
say
;
or
,
if
*NL*
it
does
not
entirely
,
you
will
have
the
fever
more
lightly
.
I
advise
you
*NL*
to
be
off
as
soon
as
you
can

for
scarlet
fever
is
no
joke

miss

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
dull
at
Aunt
March

she
is
so
cross

Amy
,
looking
*NL*
rather
frightened

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo

dull
with
me
popping
in
every
day
to
tell
you
how

is

take
you
out
gallivanting
.
The
old
lady
likes
me

and
I
'll
be
as
*NL*
sweet
as
possible
to
her

slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
girl
!
Call
Meg
,
and
tell
her
you
'll
give
in

''
said
Laurie
,
with
an
*NL*
approving
pat
,
which
annoyed
Amy
more
than
the
``
giving
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
and
Jo
came
running
down
to
behold
the
miracle
which
had
been
*NL*
wrought
;
and
Amy
,
feeling
very
precious
and
self-sacrificing
,
promised
*NL*
to
go
,
if
the
doctor
said
Beth
was
going
to
be
ill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
little
dear
?
''
asked
Laurie
;
for
Beth
was
his
especial
pet
,
*NL*
and
he
felt
more
anxious
about
her
than
he
liked
to
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
lying
down
on
mother
's
bed
,
and
feels
better
.
The
baby
's
death
*NL*
troubled
her
,
but
I
dare
say
she
has
only
got
cold
.
Hannah
_
says
_
she
*NL*
thinks
so
;
but
she
_
looks
_
worried

that
makes
me
fidgety

answered
*NL*
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
trying
world
it
is

said
Jo
,
rumpling
up
her
hair
in
a
fretful
*NL*
sort
of
way
.
``
No

we
get
out

another

There

all
at

*NL*
``

your

Jo

and
tell
me
if
I
shall
telegraph

your

anything

asked
Laurie
,
who
never
had
been
reconciled
to
the
loss
of
*NL*
his
friend
's
one
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
troubles
me

said
Meg
.
``
I
think
we
ought

Hannah

it
will
only
make

anxious

Beth
wo

be

long

*NL*
Hannah
knows
just
what
to

said

*NL*

Jo

*NL*
*NL*
``

Laurie
's
answer

he
swung
himself
out
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
great
hopes

observed
Jo
,
watching
him
fly
over
the

fence
with
an
approving
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
very
well

was
Meg
's
somewhat
ungracious
answer
,
*NL*
for
the
subject
did
not
interest
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Bangs
came
,
said
Beth
had
symptoms
of
the
fever
,
but
thought
she
*NL*
would
have
it
lightly
,
though
he
looked
sober
over
the
Hummel
story
.
Amy
*NL*
was
ordered
off
at
once
,
and
provided
with
something
to
ward
off
danger
,
*NL*
she
departed
in
great
state
,
with
Jo
and
Laurie
as
escort

*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
March
received
them
with
her
usual
hospitality

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

she
asked

looking
sharply
over

the
parrot

sitting
on
the

called

*NL*
Amy

was
_
on
the
point
of
crying

but
Laurie
slyly
pulled
the
parrot

*NL*
tail
,
which
caused
Polly
to
utter
an
astonished
croak
,
and
call
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless

in
such
a
funny
way

that
she
laughed
instead

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

asked
the
old

gruffly

squalled
Polly

dancing
on

clawing
at
the

tweaked
him
in

running

DARK
DAYS

Beth

the
fever
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
did
have
the
fever
,
and
was
much
sicker
than
any
one
but
Hannah
and
*NL*
the
doctor
suspected
.
The
girls
knew
nothing
about
illness
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Laurence
was
not
allowed
to
see
her
,
so
Hannah
had
everything
all
her
*NL*
own
way
,
and
busy
Dr.
Bangs
did
his
best
,
but
left
a
good
deal
to
the
*NL*
excellent
nurse
.
Meg
stayed
at
home
,
lest
she
should
infect
the
Kings
,
*NL*
and
kept
house
,
feeling
very
anxious
and
a
little
guilty
when
she
wrote
*NL*
letters
in
which
no
mention
was
made
of
Beth
's
illness
.
She
could
not
*NL*
think
it
right
to
deceive
her
mother
,
but
she
had
been
bidden
to
mind
*NL*
Hannah
,
and
Hannah
would
n't
hear
of
``
Mrs.
March
bein
'
told
,
and
worried
*NL*
just
for
sech
a
trifle
.
''
Jo
devoted
herself
to
Beth
day
and
night
;
not
a
*NL*
hard
task
,
for
Beth
was
very
patient
,
and
bore
her
pain
uncomplainingly
*NL*
as
long
as
she
could
control
herself
.
But
there
came
a
time
when
during
*NL*
the
fever
fits
she
began
to
talk
in
a
hoarse
,
broken
voice
,
to
play
on
*NL*
the
coverlet
,
as
if
on
her
beloved
little
piano
,
and
try
to
sing
with
a
*NL*
throat
so
swollen
that
there
was
no
music
left
;
a
time
when
she
did
not
*NL*
know
the
familiar
faces
round
her
,
but
addressed
them
by
wrong
names
,
*NL*
and
called
imploringly
for
her
mother
.
Then
Jo
grew
frightened
,
Meg
*NL*
begged
to
be
allowed
to
write
the
truth
,
and
even
Hannah
said
she
``
would
*NL*
think
of
it
,
though
there
was
no
danger
_
yet
_
.
''
A
letter
from
Washington
*NL*
added
to
their
trouble
,
for
Mr.
March
had
had
a
relapse
,
and
could
not
*NL*
think
of
coming
home
for
a
long
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
dark
the
days
seemed
now
,
how
sad
and
lonely
the
house
,
and
how
*NL*
heavy
were
the
hearts
of
the
sisters
as
they
worked
and
waited
,
while
*NL*
the
shadow
of
death
hovered
over
the
once
happy
home
!
Then
it
was
that
*NL*
Margaret
,
sitting
alone
with
tears
dropping
often
on
her
work
,
felt
how
*NL*
rich
she
had
been
in
things
more
precious
than
any
luxuries
money
could
*NL*
buy
,
--
in
love
,
protection
,
peace
,
and
health
,
the
real
blessings
of
*NL*
life
.
Then
it
was
that
Jo
,
living
in
the
darkened
room
,
with
that
*NL*
suffering
little
sister
always
before
her
eyes
,
and
that
pathetic
voice
*NL*
sounding
in
her
ears
,
learned
to
see
the
beauty
and
the
sweetness
of
*NL*
Beth
's
nature
,
to
feel
how
deep
and
tender
a
place
she
filled
in
all
*NL*
hearts
,
and
to
acknowledge
the
worth
of
Beth
's
unselfish
ambition
,
to
*NL*
live
for
others
,
and
make
home
happy
by
the
exercise
of
those
simple
*NL*
virtues
which
all
may
possess
,
and
which
all
should
love
and
value
more
*NL*
than
talent
,
wealth
,
or
beauty
.
And
Amy
,
in
her
exile
,
longed
eagerly
to
*NL*
be
at
home
,
that
she
might
work
for
Beth
,
feeling
now
that
no
service
*NL*
would
be
hard
or
irksome
,
and
remembering
,
with
regretful
grief
,
how
*NL*
many
neglected
tasks
those
willing
hands
had
done
for
her
.
Laurie
*NL*
haunted
the
house
like
a
restless
ghost
,
and
Mr.
Laurence
locked
the
*NL*
grand
piano
,
because
he
could
not
bear
to
be
reminded
of
the
young
*NL*
neighbor
who
used
to
make
the
twilight
pleasant
for
him
.
Every
one
*NL*
missed
Beth
.
The
milkman
,
baker
,
grocer
,
and
butcher
inquired
how
she
*NL*
did
;
poor
Mrs.
Hummel
came
to
beg
pardon
for
her
thoughtlessness
,
and
to
*NL*
get
a
shroud
for
Minna
;
the
neighbors
sent
all
sorts
of
comforts
and
*NL*
good
wishes
,
and
even
those
who
knew
her
best
were
surprised
to
find
how
*NL*
many
friends
shy
little
Beth
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
she
lay
on
her
bed
with
old
Joanna
at
her
side
,
for
even
in
*NL*
her
wanderings
she
did
not
forget
her
forlorn
_
protege
_
.
She
longed
for
*NL*
her
cats
,
but
would
not
have
them
brought
,
lest
they
should
get
sick
;
*NL*
and
,
in
her
quiet
hours
,
she
was
full
of
anxiety
about
Jo
.
She
sent
*NL*
loving
messages
to
Amy
,
bade
them
tell
her
mother
that
she
would
write
*NL*
soon
;
and
often
begged
for
pencil
and
paper
to
try
to
say
a
word
,
that
*NL*
father
might
not
think
she
had
neglected
him
.
But
soon
even
these
*NL*
intervals
of
consciousness
ended
,
and
she
lay
hour
after
hour
,
tossing
*NL*
to
and
fro
,
with
incoherent
words
on
her
lips
,
or
sank
into
a
heavy
*NL*
sleep
which
brought
her
no
refreshment
.
Dr.
Bangs
came
twice
a
day
,
*NL*
Hannah
sat
up
at
night
,
Meg
kept
a
telegram
in
her
desk
all
ready
to
*NL*
send
off
at
any
minute
,
and
Jo
never
stirred
from
Beth
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
of
December
was
a
wintry
day
indeed
to
them
,
for
a
bitter
wind
*NL*
blew
,
snow
fell
fast
,
and
the
year
seemed
getting
ready
for
its
death
.
*NL*
When
Dr.
Bangs
came
that
morning
,
he
looked
long
at
Beth
,
held
the
hot
*NL*
hand
in
both
his
own
a
minute
,
and
laid
it
gently
down
,
saying
,
in
a
low
*NL*
tone
,
to
Hannah
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Mrs.
March
_
can
_
leave
her
husband
,
she
'd
better
be
sent
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hannah
nodded
without
speaking
,
for
her
lips
twitched
nervously
;
Meg
*NL*
dropped
down
into
a
chair
as
the
strength
seemed
to
go
out
of
her
limbs
*NL*
at
the
sound
of
those
words
;
and
Jo
,
after
standing
with
a
pale
face
for
*NL*
a
minute
,
ran
to
the
parlor
,
snatched
up
the
telegram
,
and
,
throwing
on
*NL*
her
things
,
rushed
out
into
the
storm
.
She
was
soon
back
,
and
,
while
*NL*
noiselessly
taking
off
her
cloak
,
Laurie
came
in
with
a
letter
,
saying
*NL*
that
Mr.
March
was
mending
again
.
Jo
read
it
thankfully
,
but
the
heavy
*NL*
weight
did
not
seem
lifted
off
her
heart
,
and
her
face
was
so
full
of
*NL*
misery
that
Laurie
asked
quickly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
is
Beth
worse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
sent
for
mother
,
''
said
Jo
,
tugging
at
her
rubber
boots
with
a
*NL*
tragical
expression
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
for
you
,
Jo
!
Did
you
do
it
on
your
own
responsibility
?
''
asked
*NL*
Laurie
,
as
he
seated
her
in
the
hall
chair
,
and
took
off
the
rebellious
*NL*
boots
,
seeing
how
her
hands
shook
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,

doctor
told
us
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Jo
,
it
's
not
so
bad
as
that
?
''
cried
Laurie
,
with
a
startled
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
;
she
does
n't
know
us
,
she
does
n't
even
talk
about
the
*NL*
flocks
of
green
doves
,
as
she
calls
the
vine-leaves
on
the
wall
;
she
*NL*
does
n't
look
like
my
Beth
,
and
there
's
nobody
to
help
us
bear
it
;
mother
*NL*
and
father
both
gone
,
and
God
seems
so
far
away
I
ca
n't
find
Him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
tears
streamed
fast
down
poor
Jo
's
cheeks
,
she
stretched
out
her
*NL*
hand
in
a
helpless
sort
of
way
,
as
if
groping
in
the
dark
,
and
Laurie
*NL*
took
it
in
his
,
whispering
,
as
well
as
he
could
,
with
a
lump
in
his
*NL*
throat
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
here
.
Hold
on
to
me
,
Jo
,
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
speak
,
but
she
did
``
hold
on
,
''
and
the
warm
grasp
of
the
*NL*
friendly
human
hand
comforted
her
sore
heart
,
and
seemed
to
lead
her
*NL*
nearer
to
the
Divine
arm
which
alone
could
uphold
her
in
her
trouble
.
*NL*
Laurie
longed
to
say
something
tender
and
comfortable
,
but
no
fitting
*NL*
words
came
to
him
,
so
he
stood
silent
,
gently
stroking
her
bent
head
as
*NL*
her
mother
used
to
do
.
It
was
the
best
thing
he
could
have
done
;
far
*NL*
more
soothing
than
the
most
eloquent
words
,
for
Jo
felt
the
unspoken
*NL*
sympathy
,
and
,
in
the
silence
,
learned
the
sweet
solace
which
affection
*NL*
administers
to
sorrow
.
Soon
she
dried
the
tears
which
had
relieved
her
,
*NL*
and
looked
up
with
a
grateful
face
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Teddy
,
I
'm
better
now
;
I
do
n't
feel
so
forlorn
,
and
will
try
*NL*
to
bear
it
if
it
comes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
hoping
for
the
best

that
will

Soon
your

then
everything

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
glad
father
is
better
;
now
she
wo
n't
feel
so
bad
about
leaving
*NL*
him

Oh
,
me
!
it
does
seem
as
if
all
the
troubles
came
in
a
heap
,
and
I
*NL*
got
the
heaviest
part
on
my
shoulders
,
''
sighed
Jo
,
spreading
her
wet
*NL*
handkerchief
over
her
knees
to
dry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
Meg
pull
fair
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
looking
indignant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
;
she
tries
to
,
but
she
ca
n't
love
Bethy
as
I
do
;
and
she
wo
n't
*NL*
miss
her
as
I
shall
.
Beth
is
my
conscience
,
and
I
_
ca
n't
_
give
her
up
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
!
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Down
went
Jo
's
face
into
the
wet
handkerchief
,
and
she
cried
*NL*
despairingly
;
for
she
had
kept
up
bravely
till
now
,
and
never
shed
a
*NL*
tear
.
Laurie
drew
his
hand
across
his
eyes
,
but
could
not
speak
till
he
*NL*
had
subdued
the
choky
feeling
in
his
throat
and
steadied
his
lips
.
It
*NL*
might
be
unmanly
,
but
he
could
n't
help
it
,
and
I
am
glad
of
it
.
*NL*
Presently
,
as
Jo
's
sobs
quieted
,
he
said
hopefully
,
``
I
do
n't
think
she
*NL*
will
die
;
she
's
so
good
,
and
we
all
love
her
so
much
,
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
God
will
take
her
away
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
good
and
dear
people
always
do
die
,
''
groaned
Jo
,
but
she
stopped
*NL*
crying
,
for
her
friend
's
words
cheered
her
up
,
in
spite
of
her
own
*NL*
doubts
and
fears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
girl
,
you
're
worn
out
.
It
is
n't
like
you
to
be
forlorn
.
Stop
a
*NL*
bit
;
I
'll
hearten
you
up
in
a
jiffy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
went
off
two
stairs
at
a
time
,
and
Jo
laid
her
wearied
head
down
*NL*
on
Beth
's
little
brown
hood
,
which
no
one
had
thought
of
moving
from
the
*NL*
table
where
she
left
it
.
It
must
have
possessed
some
magic
,
for
the
*NL*
submissive
spirit
of
its
gentle
owner
seemed
to
enter
into
Jo
;
and
,
when
*NL*
Laurie
came
running
down
with
a
glass
of
wine
,
she
took
it
with
a
smile
,
*NL*
and
said
bravely
,
``
I
drink
--
Health
to
my
Beth
!
You
are
a
good
doctor
,
*NL*
Teddy
,
and
_
such
_
a
comfortable
friend
;
how
can
I
ever
pay
you
?
''
she
*NL*
added
,
as
the
wine
refreshed
her
body
,
as
the
kind
words
had
done
her
*NL*
troubled
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
send
in
my
bill
,
by
and
by
;
and
to-night
I
'll
give
you
something
*NL*
that
will
warm
the
cockles
of
your
heart
better
than
quarts
of
wine
,
''
*NL*
said
Laurie
,
beaming
at
her
with
a
face
of
suppressed
satisfaction
at
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
cried
Jo
,
forgetting
her
woes
for
a
minute
,
in
her
wonder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
telegraphed
to
your
mother
yesterday
,
and
Brooke
answered
she
'd
come
*NL*
at
once
,
and
she
'll
be
here
to-night
,
and
everything
will
be
all
right
.
*NL*
Are
n't
you
glad
I
did
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
spoke
very
fast
,
and
turned
red
and
excited
all
in
a
minute
,
for
*NL*
he
had
kept
his
plot
a
secret
,
for
fear
of
disappointing
the
girls
or
*NL*
harming
Beth
.
Jo
grew
quite
white
,
flew
out
of
her
chair
,
and
the
moment
*NL*
he
stopped
speaking
she
electrified
him
by
throwing
her
arms
round
his
*NL*
neck
,
and
crying
out
,
with
a
joyful
cry
,
``
O
Laurie
!
O
mother
!
I
_
am
_
so
*NL*
glad
!
''
She
did
not
weep
again
,
but
laughed
hysterically
,
and
trembled
*NL*
and
clung
to
her
friend
as
if
she
was
a
little
bewildered
by
the
sudden
*NL*
news
.
Laurie
,
though
decidedly
amazed
,
behaved
with
great
presence
of
*NL*
mind
;
he
patted
her
back
soothingly
,
and
,
finding
that
she
was
*NL*
recovering
,
followed
it
up
by
a
bashful
kiss
or
two
,
which
brought
Jo
*NL*
round
at
once
.
Holding
on
to
the
banisters
,
she
put
him
gently
away
,
*NL*
saying
breathlessly
,
``
Oh
,
do
n't
!
I
did
n't
mean
to
;
it
was
dreadful
of
*NL*
me
;
but
you
were
such
a
dear
to
go
and
do
it
in
spite
of
Hannah
that
I
*NL*
could
n't
help
flying
at
you
.
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
and
do
n't
give
me
*NL*
wine
again
;
it
makes
me
act
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
,
''
laughed
Laurie
,
as
he
settled
his
tie
.
``
Why
,
you
see
I
*NL*
got
fidgety
,
and
so
did
grandpa
.
We
thought
Hannah
was
overdoing
the
*NL*
authority
business
,
and
your
mother
ought
to
know
.
She
'd
never
forgive
*NL*
us
if
Beth
--
well
,
if
anything
happened
,
you
know
.
So
I
got
grandpa
to
*NL*
say
it
was
high
time
we
did
something
,
and
off
I
pelted
to
the
office
*NL*
yesterday
,
for
the
doctor
looked
sober
,
and
Hannah
most
took
my
head
off
*NL*
when
I
proposed
a
telegram
.
I
never
_
can
_
bear
to
be
`
lorded
over
;
'
so
*NL*
that
settled
my
mind
,
and
I
did
it
.
Your
mother
will
come
,
I
know
,
and
*NL*
the
late
train
is
in
at
two
,
A.M.
I
shall
go
for
her
;
and
you
've
only
*NL*
got
to
bottle
up
your
rapture
,
and
keep
Beth
quiet
,
till
that
blessed
*NL*
lady
gets
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laurie
,
you
're
an
angel
!
How
shall
I
ever
thank
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fly
at
me
again
;
I
rather
like
it
,
''
said
Laurie
,
looking
*NL*
mischievous
,
--
a
thing
he
had
not
done
for
a
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
.
I
'll
do
it
by
proxy
,
when
your
grandpa
comes
.
Do
n't
*NL*
tease
,
but
go
home
and
rest
,
for
you
'll
be
up
half
the
night
.
Bless
you
,
*NL*
Teddy
,
bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
had
backed
into
a
corner
;
and
,
as
she
finished
her
speech
,
she
*NL*
vanished
precipitately
into
the
kitchen
,
where
she
sat
down
upon
a
*NL*
dresser
,
and
told
the
assembled
cats
that
she
was
``
happy
,
oh
,
_
so
_
*NL*
happy
!
''
while
Laurie
departed
,
feeling
that
he
had
made
rather
a
neat
*NL*
thing
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
interferingest
chap
I
ever
see
;
but
I
forgive
him
,
and
do
*NL*
hope
Mrs.
March
is
coming
on
right
away
,
''
said
Hannah
,
with
an
air
of
*NL*
relief
,
when
Jo
told
the
good
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
had
a
quiet
rapture
,
and
then
brooded
over
the
letter
,
while
Jo
set
*NL*
the
sick-room
in
order
,
and
Hannah
``
knocked
up
a
couple
of
pies
in
case
*NL*
of
company
unexpected
.
''
A
breath
of
fresh
air
seemed
to
blow
through
the
*NL*
house
,
and
something
better
than
sunshine
brightened
the
quiet
rooms
.
*NL*
Everything
appeared
to
feel
the
hopeful
change
;
Beth
's
bird
began
to
*NL*
chirp
again
,
and
a
half-blown
rose
was
discovered
on
Amy
's
bush
in
the
*NL*
window
;
the
fires
seemed
to
burn
with
unusual
cheeriness
;
and
every
time
*NL*
the
girls
met
,
their
pale
faces
broke
into
smiles
as
they
hugged
one
*NL*
another
,
whispering
encouragingly
,
``
Mother
's
coming
,
dear
!
mother
's
*NL*
coming
!
''
Every
one
rejoiced
but
Beth
;
she
lay
in
that
heavy
stupor
,
*NL*
alike
unconscious
of
hope
and
joy
,
doubt
and
danger
.
It
was
a
piteous
*NL*
sight
,
--
the
once
rosy
face
so
changed
and
vacant
,
the
once
busy
hands
so
*NL*
weak
and
wasted
,
the
once
smiling
lips
quite
dumb
,
and
the
once
pretty
,
*NL*
well-kept
hair
scattered
rough
and
tangled
on
the
pillow
.
All
day
she
*NL*
lay
so
,
only
rousing
now
and
then
to
mutter
,
``
Water
!
''
with
lips
so
*NL*
parched
they
could
hardly
shape
the
word
;
all
day
Jo
and
Meg
hovered
*NL*
over
her
,
watching
,
waiting
,
hoping
,
and
trusting
in
God
and
mother
;
and
*NL*
all
day
the
snow
fell
,
the
bitter
wind
raged
,
and
the
hours
dragged
*NL*
slowly
by
.
But
night
came
at
last
;
and
every
time
the
clock
struck
,
the
*NL*
sisters
,
still
sitting
on
either
side
the
bed
,
looked
at
each
other
with
*NL*
brightening
eyes
,
for
each
hour
brought
help
nearer
.
The
doctor
had
been
*NL*
in
to
say
that
some
change
,
for
better
or
worse
,
would
probably
take
*NL*
place
about
midnight
,
at
which
time
he
would
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hannah
,
quite
worn
out
,
lay
down
on
the
sofa
at
the
bed
's
foot
,
and
fell
*NL*
fast
asleep
;
Mr.
Laurence
marched
to
and
fro
in
the
parlor
,
feeling
that
*NL*
he
would
rather
face
a
rebel
battery
than
Mrs.
March
's
anxious
*NL*
countenance
as
she
entered
;
Laurie
lay
on
the
rug
,
pretending
to
rest
,
*NL*
but
staring
into
the
fire
with
the
thoughtful
look
which
made
his
black
*NL*
eyes
beautifully
soft
and
clear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
never
forgot
that
night
,
for
no
sleep
came
to
them
as
they
*NL*
kept
their
watch
,
with
that
dreadful
sense
of
powerlessness
which
comes
*NL*
to
us
in
hours
like
those
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
God
spares
Beth
I
never
will
complain
again
,
''
whispered
Meg
*NL*
earnestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
God
spares
Beth
I
'll
try
to
love
and
serve
Him
all
my
life
,
''
*NL*
answered
Jo
,
with
equal
fervor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
had
no
heart
,
it
aches
so
,
''
sighed
Meg
,
after
a
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
life
is
often
as
hard
as
this
,
I
do
n't
see
how
we
ever
shall
get
*NL*
through
it
,
''
added
her
sister
despondently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
clock
struck
twelve
,
and
both
forgot
themselves
in
watching
*NL*
Beth
,
for
they
fancied
a
change
passed
over
her
wan
face
.
The
house
was
*NL*
still
as
death
,
and
nothing
but
the
wailing
of
the
wind
broke
the
deep
*NL*
hush
.
Weary
Hannah
slept
on
,
and
no
one
but
the
sisters
saw
the
pale
*NL*
shadow
which
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
little
bed
.
An
hour
went
by
,
and
*NL*
nothing
happened
except
Laurie
's
quiet
departure
for
the
station
.
*NL*
Another
hour
,
--
still
no
one
came
;
and
anxious
fears
of
delay
in
the
*NL*
storm
,
or
accidents
by
the
way
,
or
,
worst
of
all
,
a
great
grief
at
*NL*
Washington
,
haunted
the
poor
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
past
two
,
when
Jo
,
who
stood
at
the
window
thinking
how
dreary
*NL*
the
world
looked
in
its
winding-sheet
of
snow
,
heard
a
movement
by
the
*NL*
bed
,
and
,
turning
quickly
,
saw
Meg
kneeling
before
their
mother
's
*NL*
easy-chair
,
with
her
face
hidden
.
A
dreadful
fear
passed
coldly
over
Jo
,
*NL*
as
she
thought
,
``
Beth
is
dead
,
and
Meg
is
afraid
to
tell
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
back
at
her
post
in
an
instant
,
and
to
her
excited
eyes
a
great
*NL*
change
seemed
to
have
taken
place
.
The
fever
flush
and
the
look
of
pain
*NL*
were
gone
,
and
the
beloved
little
face
looked
so
pale
and
peaceful
in
*NL*
its
utter
repose
,
that
Jo
felt
no
desire
to
weep
or
to
lament
.
Leaning
*NL*
low
over
this
dearest
of
her
sisters
,
she
kissed
the
damp
forehead
with
*NL*
her
heart
on
her
lips
,
and
softly
whispered
,
``
Good-by
,
my
Beth
;
*NL*
good-by
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
waked
by
the
stir
,
Hannah
started
out
of
her
sleep
,
hurried
to
the
*NL*
bed
,
looked
at
Beth
,
felt
her
hands
,
listened
at
her
lips
,
and
then
,
*NL*
throwing
her
apron
over
her
head
,
sat
down
to
rock
to
and
fro
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
under
her
breath
,
``
The
fever
's
turned
;
she
's
sleepin
'
*NL*
nat
`
ral
;
her
skin
's
damp
,
and
she
breathes
easy
.
Praise
be
given
!
Oh
,
my
*NL*
goodness
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
girls
could
believe
the
happy
truth
,
the
doctor
came
to
*NL*
confirm
it
.
He
was
a
homely
man
,
but
they
thought
his
face
quite
*NL*
heavenly
when
he
smiled
,
and
said
,
with
a
fatherly
look
at
them
,
``
Yes
,
*NL*
my
dears
,
I
think
the
little
girl
will
pull
through
this
time
.
Keep
the
*NL*
house
quiet
;
let
her
sleep
,
and
when
she
wakes
,
give
her
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
What
they
were
to
give
,
neither
heard
;
for
both
crept
into
the
dark
*NL*
hall
,
and
,
sitting
on
the
stairs
,
held
each
other
close
,
rejoicing
with
*NL*
hearts
too
full
for
words
.
When
they
went
back
to
be
kissed
and
cuddled
*NL*
by
faithful
Hannah
,
they
found
Beth
lying
,
as
she
used
to
do
,
with
her
*NL*
cheek
pillowed
on
her
hand
,
the
dreadful
pallor
gone
,
and
breathing
*NL*
quietly
,
as
if
just
fallen
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
mother
would
only
come
now
!
''
said
Jo
,
as
the
winter
night
began
to
*NL*
wane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
,
''
said
Meg
,
coming
up
with
a
white
,
half-opened
rose
,
``
I
thought
*NL*
this
would
hardly
be
ready
to
lay
in
Beth
's
hand
to-morrow
if
she
--
went
*NL*
away
from
us
.
But
it
has
blossomed
in
the
night
,
and
now
I
mean
to
put
*NL*
it
in
my
vase
here
,
so
that
when
the
darling
wakes
,
the
first
thing
she
*NL*
sees
will
be
the
little
rose
,
and
mother
's
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
the
sun
risen
so
beautifully
,
and
never
had
the
world
seemed
*NL*
so
lovely
,
as
it
did
to
the
heavy
eyes
of
Meg
and
Jo
,
as
they
looked
out
*NL*
in
the
early
morning
,
when
their
long
,
sad
vigil
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
looks
like
a
fairy
world

''
said
Meg
,
smiling
to
herself
,
as
she
*NL*
stood
behind
the
curtain
,
watching
the
dazzling
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
cried
Jo
,
starting
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
there
was
a
sound
of
bells
at
the
door
below
,
a
cry
from
Hannah
,
*NL*
and
then
Laurie
's
voice
saying
,
in
a
joyful
whisper
,
``
Girls

come

AMY

*NL*
While
these
things
were
happening
at
home
,
Amy
was
having
hard
times
at
*NL*
Aunt
March
's
.
She
felt
her
exile
deeply
,
and
,
for
the
first
time
in
her
*NL*
life
,
realized
how
much
she
was
beloved
and
petted
at
home
.
Aunt
March
*NL*
never
petted
any
one
;
she
did
not
approve
of
it
;
but
she
meant
to
be
*NL*
kind
,
for
the
well-behaved
little
girl
pleased
her
very
much
,
and
Aunt
*NL*
March
had
a
soft
place
in
her
old
heart
for
her
nephew
's
children
,
*NL*
though
she
did
n't
think
proper
to
confess
it
.
She
really
did
her
best
to
*NL*
make
Amy
happy
,
but
,
dear
me
,
what
mistakes
she
made
!
Some
old
people
*NL*
keep
young
at
heart
in
spite
of
wrinkles
and
gray
hairs
,
can
sympathize
*NL*
with
children
's
little
cares
and
joys
,
make
them
feel
at
home
,
and
can
*NL*
hide
wise
lessons
under
pleasant
plays
,
giving
and
receiving
friendship
*NL*
in
the
sweetest
way
.
But
Aunt
March
had
not
this
gift
,
and
she
worried
*NL*
Amy
very
much
with
her
rules
and
orders
,
her
prim
ways
,
and
long
,
prosy
*NL*
talks
.
Finding
the
child
more
docile
and
amiable
than
her
sister
,
the
*NL*
old
lady
felt
it
her
duty
to
try
and
counteract
,
as
far
as
possible
,
the
*NL*
bad
effects
of
home
freedom
and
indulgence
.
So
she
took
Amy
in
hand
,
and
*NL*
taught
her
as
she
herself
had
been
taught
sixty
years
ago
,
--
a
process
*NL*
which
carried
dismay
to
Amy
's
soul
,
and
made
her
feel
like
a
fly
in
the
*NL*
web
of
a
very
strict
spider
.

*NL*

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
to
wash
the
cups
every
morning
,
and
polish
up
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
spoons
,
the
fat
silver
teapot
,
and
the
glasses
,
till
they
shone
.
Then
*NL*
she
must
dust
the
room
,
and
what
a
trying
job
that
was
!
Not
a
speck
*NL*
escaped
Aunt
March
's
eye
,
and
all
the
furniture
had
claw
legs
,
and
much
*NL*
carving
,
which
was
never
dusted
to
suit
.
Then
Polly
must
be
fed
,
the
*NL*
lap-dog
combed
,
and
a
dozen
trips
upstairs
and
down
,
to
get
things
,
or
*NL*
deliver
orders
,
for
the
old
lady
was
very
lame
,
and
seldom
left
her
big
*NL*
chair
.
After
these
tiresome
labors
,
she
must
do
her
lessons
,
which
was
a
*NL*
daily
trial
of
every
virtue
she
possessed
.
Then
she
was
allowed
one
hour
*NL*
for
exercise
or
play
,
and
did
n't
she
enjoy
it
?
Laurie
came
every
day
,
*NL*
and
wheedled
Aunt
March
,
till
Amy
was
allowed
to
go
out
with
him
,
when
*NL*
they
walked
and
rode
,
and
had
capital
times
.
After
dinner
,
she
had
to
*NL*
read
aloud
,
and
sit
still
while
the
old
lady
slept
,
which
she
usually
*NL*
did
for
an
hour
,
as
she
dropped
off
over
the
first
page
.
Then
patchwork
*NL*
or
towels
appeared
,
and
Amy
sewed
with
outward
meekness
and
inward
*NL*
rebellion
till
dusk
,
when
she
was
allowed
to
amuse
herself
as
she
liked
*NL*
till
tea-time
.
The
evenings
were
the
worst
of
all
,
for
Aunt
March
fell
*NL*
to
telling
long
stories
about
her
youth
,
which
were
so
unutterably
dull
*NL*
that
Amy
was
always
ready
to
go
to
bed
,
intending
to
cry
over
her
hard
*NL*
fate
,
but
usually
going
to
sleep
before
she
had
squeezed
out
more
than
a
*NL*
tear
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
had
not
been
for
Laurie
,
and
old
Esther
,
the
maid
,
she
felt
that
*NL*
she
never
could
have
got
through
that
dreadful
time
.
The
parrot
alone
*NL*
was
enough
to
drive
her
distracted
,
for
he
soon
felt
that
she
did
not
*NL*
admire
him
,
and
revenged
himself
by
being
as
mischievous
as
possible
.
He
*NL*
pulled
her
hair
whenever
she
came
near
him
,
upset
his
bread
and
milk
to
*NL*
plague
her
when
she
had
newly
cleaned
his
cage
,
made
Mop
bark
by
pecking
*NL*
at
him
while
Madam
dozed
;
called
her
names
before
company
,
and
behaved
*NL*
in
all
respects
like
a
reprehensible
old
bird
.
Then
she
could
not
endure
*NL*
the
dog
,
--
a
fat
,
cross
beast
,
who
snarled
and
yelped
at
her
when
she
*NL*
made
his
toilet
,
and
who
lay
on
his
back
,
with
all
his
legs
in
the
air
*NL*
and
a
most
idiotic
expression
of
countenance
when
he
wanted
something
to
*NL*
eat
,
which
was
about
a
dozen
times
a
day
.
The
cook
was
bad-tempered
,
the
*NL*
old
coachman
deaf
,
and
Esther
the
only
one
who
ever
took
any
notice
of
*NL*
the
young
lady
.

*NL*
Esther
was
a
Frenchwoman
,
who
had
lived
with
``
Madame
,
''
as
she
called
her
*NL*
mistress
,
for
many
years
,
and
who
rather
tyrannized
over
the
old
lady
,
*NL*
who
could
not
get
along
without
her
.
Her
real
name
was
Estelle
,
but
*NL*
Aunt
March
ordered
her
to
change
it
,
and
she
obeyed
,
on
condition
that
*NL*
she
was
never
asked
to
change
her
religion
.
She
took
a
fancy
to
*NL*
Mademoiselle
,
and
amused
her
very
much
,
with
odd
stories
of
her
life
in
*NL*
France
,
when
Amy
sat
with
her
while
she
got
up
Madame
's
laces
.
She
also
*NL*
allowed
her
to
roam
about
the
great
house
,
and
examine
the
curious
and
*NL*
pretty
things
stored
away
in
the
big
wardrobes
and
the
ancient
chests
;
*NL*
for
Aunt
March
hoarded
like
a
magpie
.
Amy
's
chief
delight
was
an
Indian
*NL*
cabinet
,
full
of
queer
drawers
,
little
pigeon-holes
,
and
secret
places
,
*NL*
in
which
were
kept
all
sorts
of
ornaments
,
some
precious
,
some
merely
*NL*
curious
,
all
more
or
less
antique
.
To
examine
and
arrange
these
things
*NL*
gave
Amy
great
satisfaction
,
especially
the
jewel-cases
,
in
which
,
on
*NL*
velvet
cushions
,
reposed
the
ornaments
which
had
adorned
a
belle
forty
*NL*
years
ago
.
There
was
the
garnet
set
which
Aunt
March
wore
when
she
came
*NL*
out
,
the
pearls
her
father
gave
her
on
her
wedding-day
,
her
lover
's
*NL*
diamonds
,
the
jet
mourning
rings
and
pins
,
the
queer
lockets
,
with
*NL*
portraits
of
dead
friends
,
and
weeping
willows
made
of
hair
inside
;
the
*NL*
baby
bracelets
her
one
little
daughter
had
worn
;
Uncle
March
's
big
*NL*
watch
,
with
the
red
seal
so
many
childish
hands
had
played
with
,
and
in
*NL*
a
box
,
all
by
itself
,
lay
Aunt
March
's
wedding-ring
,
too
small
now
for
*NL*
her
fat
finger
,
but
put
carefully
away
,
like
the
most
precious
jewel
of
*NL*
them
all
.

Amy
,
looking
with
great
admiration
at
a

of
gold

,
from
which
hung
a
heavy
cross
of

no

rosary

I

said
Esther
,
*NL*
eying
the
handsome
thing
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
meant
to
use
as
you
use

good-smelling

asked
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

it

be

did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Would

be

asked
Amy
,
who
,
in
her
*NL*
loneliness
,
felt
the
need
of
help
of
some
sort
,
and
found
that
she
was
*NL*
apt
to
forget
her
little
book
,
now
that
Beth
was
not
there
to
remind
her
*NL*
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
excellent

charming

I
shall
gladly

little

you
like
it

Say
nothing
to
Madame

but
*NL*
when
she
sleeps
go
you
and
sit
alone
a
while
to
think
good
thoughts

*NL*
pray
the

to
preserve
your
sister

''
*NL*
*NL*
Esther
was
truly
pious
,
and
quite
sincere
in
her
advice
;
for
she
had
an
*NL*
affectionate
heart
,
and
felt
much
for
the
sisters
in
their
anxiety
.
Amy
*NL*
liked
the
idea
,
and
gave
her
leave
to
arrange
the
light
closet
next
her
*NL*
room
,
hoping
it
would
do
her
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

shut

can
only
have
that
lovely
*NL*
ring
!
It
's
ever
so
much
prettier
than
Kitty
Bryant
's
.
I
do
like
Aunt
*NL*
March
,
after
all
;
''
and
Amy
tried
on
the
blue
ring
with
a
delighted
face
,
*NL*
and
a
firm
resolve
to
earn
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
day
she
was
a
model
of
obedience
,
and
the
old
lady
*NL*
complacently
admired
the
success
of
her
training
.
Esther
fitted
up
the
*NL*
closet
with
a
little
table
,
placed
a
footstool
before
it
,
and
over
it
a
*NL*
picture
taken
from
one
of
the
shut-up
rooms
.
She
thought
it
was
of
no
*NL*
great
value
,
but
,
being
appropriate
,
she
borrowed
it
,
well
knowing
that
*NL*
Madame
would
never
know
it
,
nor
care
if
she
did
.
It
was
,
however
,
a
very
*NL*
valuable
copy
of
one
of
the
famous
pictures
of
the
world
,
and
Amy
's
*NL*
beauty-loving
eyes
were
never
tired
of
looking
up
at
the
sweet
face
of
*NL*
the
divine
mother
,
while
tender
thoughts
of
her
own
were
busy
at
her
*NL*
heart
.
On
the
table
she
laid
her
little
Testament
and
hymn-book
,
kept
a
*NL*
vase
always
full
of
the
best
flowers
Laurie
brought
her
,
and
came
every
*NL*
day
to
``
sit
alone
,
thinking
good
thoughts
,
and
praying
the
dear
God
to
*NL*
preserve
her
sister
.
''
Esther
had
given
her
a
rosary
of
black
beads
,
with
*NL*
a
silver
cross
,
but
Amy
hung
it
up
and
did
not
use
it
,
feeling
doubtful
*NL*
as
to
its
fitness
for
Protestant
prayers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
was
very
sincere
in
all
this
,
for
,
being
left
alone
*NL*
outside
the
safe
home-nest
,
she
felt
the
need
of
some
kind
hand
to
hold
*NL*
by
so
sorely
,
that
she
instinctively
turned
to
the
strong
and
tender
*NL*
Friend
,
whose
fatherly
love
most
closely
surrounds
his
little
children
.
*NL*
She
missed
her
mother
's
help
to
understand
and
rule
herself
,
but
having
*NL*
been
taught
where
to
look
,
she
did
her
best
to
find
the
way
,
and
walk
in
*NL*
it
confidingly
.
But
Amy
was
a
young
pilgrim
,
and
just
now
her
burden
*NL*
seemed
very
heavy
.
She
tried
to
forget
herself
,
to
keep
cheerful
,
and
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
doing
right
,
though
no
one
saw
or
praised
her
for
it
.
In
*NL*
her
first
effort
at
being
very
,
very
good
,
she
decided
to
make
her
will
,
*NL*
as
Aunt
March
had
done
;
so
that
if
she
_
did
_
fall
ill
and
die
,
her
*NL*
possessions
might
be
justly
and
generously
divided
.
It
cost
her
a
pang
*NL*
even
to
think
of
giving
up
the
little
treasures
which
in
her
eyes
were
*NL*
as
precious
as
the
old
lady
's
jewels
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
one
of
her
play-hours
she
wrote
out
the
important
document
as
*NL*
well
as
she
could
,
with
some
help
from
Esther
as
to
certain
legal
terms
,
*NL*
and
,
when
the
good-natured
Frenchwoman
had
signed
her
name
,
Amy
felt
*NL*
relieved
,
and
laid
it
by
to
show
Laurie
,
whom
she
wanted
as
a
second
*NL*
witness
.
As
it
was
a
rainy
day
,
she
went
upstairs
to
amuse
herself
in
*NL*
one
of
the
large
chambers
,
and
took
Polly
with
her
for
company
.
In
this
*NL*
room
there
was
a
wardrobe
full
of
old-fashioned
costumes
,
with
which
*NL*
Esther
allowed
her
to
play
,
and
it
was
her
favorite
amusement
to
array
*NL*
herself
in
the
faded
brocades
,
and
parade
up
and
down
before
the
long
*NL*
mirror
,
making
stately
courtesies
,
and
sweeping
her
train
about
,
with
a
*NL*
rustle
which
delighted
her
ears
.
So
busy
was
she
on
this
day
that
she
*NL*
did
not
hear
Laurie
's
ring
,
nor
see
his
face
peeping
in
at
her
,
as
she
*NL*
gravely
promenaded
to
and
fro
,
flirting
her
fan
and
tossing
her
head
,
on
*NL*
which
she
wore
a
great
pink
turban
,
contrasting
oddly
with
her
blue
*NL*
brocade
dress
and
yellow
quilted
petticoat
.
She
was
obliged
to
walk
*NL*
carefully
,
for
she
had
on
high-heeled
shoes
,
and
,
as
Laurie
told
Jo
*NL*
afterward
,
it
was
a
comical
sight
to
see
her
mince
along
in
her
gay
*NL*
suit
,
with
Polly
sidling
and
bridling
just
behind
her
,
imitating
her
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
,
and
occasionally
stopping
to
laugh
or
exclaim
,
``
Ai
n't
*NL*
we
fine
?
Get
along
,
you
fright
!
Hold
your
tongue
!
Kiss
me
,
dear
!
Ha

Having
with
difficulty
restrained
an
explosion
of
merriment
,
lest
it
*NL*
should
offend
her
majesty
,
Laurie
tapped
,
and
was
graciously
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
and
rest

I
put
these

away
;
then
I
want
to
consult
*NL*
you
about

serious
matter

said
Amy
,
when
she
had
shown
her
*NL*
splendor
,
and
driven
Polly
into
a
corner
.
``
That
bird
is
the
trial
of
my
*NL*
life
,
''
she
continued
,
removing
the
pink
mountain
from
her
head
,
while
*NL*
Laurie
seated
himself
astride
of
a
chair
.
``
Yesterday
,
when
aunt
was
*NL*
asleep
,
and
I
was
trying
to
be
as
still
as
a
mouse
,
Polly
began
to
*NL*
squall
and
flap
about
in
his
cage
;
so
I
went
to
let
him
out
,
and
found
a
*NL*
big
spider
there
.
I
poked
it
out
,
and
it
ran
under
the
bookcase
;
Polly
*NL*
marched
straight
after
it
,
stooped
down
and
peeped
under
the
bookcase
,
*NL*
saying
,
in
his
funny
way
,
with
a
cock
of
his
eye
,
`
Come
out
and
take
a
*NL*
walk
,

dear
.
'
I
_
could
n't
_
help
laughing
,
which
made
Poll
swear
,
and
*NL*
aunt
woke
up
and
scolded
us
both
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
the
spider
accept
the
old
fellow
's
invitation
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
*NL*
yawning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
out
it
came
,
and
away
ran
Polly
,
frightened
to
death
,
and
*NL*
scrambled
up
on
aunt
's
chair
,
calling
out
,
`
Catch
her
!
catch

catch
*NL*

as
I
chased
the
spider
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Oh

cried
the
parrot
,
pecking
at
Laurie

toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
wring
your
neck
if
you
were
mine

''
cried
Laurie
,
*NL*
shaking
his
fist
at
the
bird
,
who
put
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
gravely
*NL*
croaked
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

said
Amy
,
shutting
the

taking
a

out
*NL*
of
her
pocket
.
``

*NL*
Laurie
was
signing
and
sealing
as
he
spoke
,
and
did
not
look
up
till
a
*NL*
great
tear
dropped
on
the
paper

Amy
's
face
was
full
of
trouble
;
but
she
*NL*
only
said
,

Laurie
added

smiling
at
Amy

last

greatest
sacrifice

Then
he

amused

for
an
hour

when

back

with

Laurie
put
his
arm
about
her
with
a
brotherly
gesture
which
*NL*
was
very
comforting

*NL*

When
he
had
gone

she
went
to
her
little

and
,
sitting
in
the

twilight

prayed
for
Beth

with
streaming
tears

an

that

turquoise
rings
would
not

the

nestled
close

girls
*NL*
waited
upon
their
mother
,
for
she
would
not
unclasp
the
thin
hand
which
*NL*
clung
to
hers
even
in
sleep
.
Hannah
had
``
dished
up
''
an
astonishing
*NL*
breakfast
for
the
traveller
,
finding
it
impossible
to
vent
her
*NL*
excitement
in
any
other
way
;
and
Meg
and
Jo
fed
their
mother
like
*NL*
dutiful
young
storks
,
while
they
listened
to
her
whispered
account
of
*NL*
father
's
state
,
Mr.
Brooke
's
promise
to
stay
and
nurse
him
,
the
delays
*NL*
which
the
storm
occasioned
on
the
homeward
journey
,
and
the
unspeakable
*NL*
comfort
Laurie
's
hopeful
face
had
given
her
when
she
arrived
,
worn
out
*NL*
with
fatigue
,
anxiety
,
and
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
a
strange
,
yet
pleasant
day
that
was
!
so
brilliant
and
gay
without
,
*NL*
for
all
the
world
seemed
abroad
to
welcome
the
first
snow
;
so
quiet
and
*NL*
reposeful
within
,
for
every
one
slept
,
spent
with
watching
,
and
a
*NL*
Sabbath
stillness
reigned
through
the
house
,
while
nodding
Hannah
*NL*
mounted
guard
at
the
door
.
With
a
blissful
sense
of
burdens
lifted
off
,
*NL*
Meg
and
Jo
closed
their
weary
eyes
,
and
lay
at
rest
,
like
storm-beaten
*NL*
boats
,
safe
at
anchor
in
a
quiet
harbor
.
Mrs.
March
would
not
leave
*NL*
Beth
's
side
,
but
rested
in
the
big
chair
,
waking
often
to
look
at
,
*NL*
touch
,
and
brood
over
her
child
,
like
a
miser
over
some
recovered
*NL*
treasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
,
meanwhile
,
posted
off
to
comfort
Amy
,
and
told
his
story
so
well
*NL*
that
Aunt
March
actually
``
sniffed
''
herself
,
and
never
once
said
,
``
I
told
*NL*
you
so
.
''
Amy
came
out
so
strong
on
this
occasion
that
I
think
the
good
*NL*
thoughts
in
the
little
chapel
really
began
to
bear
fruit
.
She
dried
her
*NL*
tears
quickly
,
restrained
her
impatience
to
see
her
mother
,
and
never
*NL*
even
thought
of
the
turquoise
ring
,
when
the
old
lady
heartily
agreed
in
*NL*
Laurie
's
opinion
,
that
she
behaved
``
like
a
capital
little
woman
.
''
Even
*NL*
Polly
seemed
impressed
,
for
he
called
her
``
good
girl
,
''
blessed
her
*NL*
buttons
,
and
begged
her
to
``
come
and
take
a
walk
,
dear
,
''
in
his
most
*NL*
affable
tone
.
She
would
very
gladly
have
gone
out
to
enjoy
the
bright
*NL*
wintry
weather
;
but
,
discovering
that
Laurie
was
dropping
with
sleep
in
*NL*
spite
of
manful
efforts
to
conceal
the
fact
,
she
persuaded
him
to
rest
*NL*
on
the
sofa
,
while
she
wrote
a
note
to
her
mother
.
She
was
a
long
time
*NL*
about
it
;
and
,
when
she
returned
,
he
was
stretched
out
,
with
both
arms
*NL*
under
his
head
,
sound
asleep
,
while
Aunt
March
had
pulled
down
the
*NL*
curtains
,
and
sat
doing
nothing
in
an
unusual
fit
of
benignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
while
,
they
began
to
think
he
was
not
going
to
wake
till
night
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
not
sure
that
he
would
,
had
he
not
been
effectually
roused
by
*NL*
Amy
's
cry
of
joy
at
sight
of
her
mother
.
There
probably
were
a
good
*NL*
many
happy
little
girls
in
and
about
the
city
that
day
,
but
it
is
my
*NL*
private
opinion
that
Amy
was
the
happiest
of
all
,
when
she
sat
in
her
*NL*
mother
's
lap
and
told
her
trials
,
receiving
consolation
and
compensation
*NL*
in
the
shape
of
approving
smiles
and
fond
caresses
.
They
were
alone
*NL*
together
in
the
chapel
,
to
which
her
mother
did
not
object
when
its
*NL*
purpose
was
explained
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
I
like
it
very
much
,
dear
,
''
looking
from
the
dusty
*NL*
rosary
to
the
well-worn
little
book
,
and
the
lovely
picture
with
its
*NL*
garland
of
evergreen
.
``
It
is
an
excellent
plan
to
have
some
place
where
*NL*
we
can
go
to
be
quiet
,
when
things
vex
or
grieve
us
.
There
are
a
good
*NL*
many
hard
times
in
this
life
of
ours
,
but
we
can
always
bear
them
if
we
*NL*
ask
help
in
the
right
way
.
I
think
my
little
girl
is
learning
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mother
;
and
when
I
go
home
I
mean
to
have
a
corner
in
the
big
*NL*
closet
to
put
my
books
,
and
the
copy
of
that
picture
which
I
've
tried
to
*NL*
make
.
The
woman
's
face
is
not
good
,
--
it
's
too
beautiful
for
me
to
*NL*
draw
,
--
but
the
baby
is
done
better
,
and
I
love
it
very
much
.
I
like
to
*NL*
think
He
was
a
little
child
once
,
for
then
I
do
n't
seem
so
far
away
,
and
*NL*
that
helps
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Amy
pointed
to
the
smiling
Christ-child
on
his
mother
's
knee
,
Mrs.
*NL*
March
saw
something
on
the
lifted
hand
that
made
her
smile
.
She
said
*NL*
nothing
,
but
Amy
understood
the
look
,
and
,
after
a
minute
's
pause
,
she
*NL*
added
gravely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
speak
to
you
about
this
,
but
I
forgot
it
.
Aunt
gave
me
the
*NL*
ring
to-day
;
she
called
me
to
her
and
kissed
me
,
and
put
it
on
my
*NL*
finger
,
and
said
I
was
a
credit
to
her
,
and
she
'd
like
to
keep
me
*NL*
always
.
She
gave
that
funny
guard
to
keep
the
turquoise
on
,
as
it
's
too
*NL*
big
.
I
'd
like
to
wear
them
,
mother
;
can
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
very
pretty
,
but
I
think
you
're
rather
too
young
for
such
*NL*
ornaments
,
Amy
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
looking
at
the
plump
little
hand
,
with
*NL*
the
band
of
sky-blue
stones
on
the
forefinger
,
and
the
quaint
guard
,
*NL*
formed
of
two
tiny
,
golden
hands
clasped
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
not
to
be
vain
,
''
said
Amy
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
like
it
only
*NL*
because
it
's
so
pretty
;
but
I
want
to
wear
it
as
the
girl
in
the
story
*NL*
wore
her
bracelet
,
to
remind
me
of
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
Aunt
March
?
''
asked
her
mother
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
to
remind
me
not
to
be
selfish
.
''
Amy
looked
so
earnest
and
sincere
*NL*
about
it
,
that
her
mother
stopped
laughing
,
and
listened
respectfully
to
*NL*
the
little
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
thought
a
great
deal
lately
about
my
`
bundle
of
naughties
,
'
and
*NL*
being
selfish
is
the
largest
one
in
it
;
so
I
'm
going
to
try
hard
to
cure
*NL*
it
,
if
I
can
.
Beth
is
n't
selfish
,
and
that
's
the
reason
every
one
loves
*NL*
her
and
feels
so
bad
at
the
thoughts
of
losing
her
.
People
would
n't
feel
*NL*
half
so
bad
about
me
if
I
was
sick
,
and
I
do
n't
deserve
to
have
them
;
*NL*
but
I
'd
like
to
be
loved
and
missed
by
a
great
many
friends
,
so
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
try
and
be
like
Beth
all
I
can
.
I
'm
apt
to
forget
my
*NL*
resolutions
;
but
if
I
had
something
always
about
me
to
remind
me
,
I
*NL*
guess
I
should
do
better
.
May
I
try
this
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
I
have
more
faith
in
the
corner
of
the
big
closet
.
Wear
your
*NL*
ring
,
dear
,
and
do
your
best
;
I
think
you
will
prosper
,
for
the
sincere
*NL*
wish
to
be
good
is
half
the
battle
.
Now
I
must
go
back
to
Beth
.
Keep
up
*NL*
your
heart
,
little
daughter
,
and
we
will
soon
have
you
home
again

*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
while
Meg
was
writing
to
her
father
,
to
report
the
*NL*
traveller
's
safe
arrival
,
Jo
slipped
up
stairs
into
Beth
's
room
,
and
,
*NL*
finding
her
mother
in
her
usual
place
,
stood
a
minute
twisting
her
*NL*
fingers
in
her
hair
,
with
a
worried
gesture
and
an
undecided
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it

deary
?

asked
Mrs.
March
,
holding
out
her
hand
,
with
a
face
*NL*
which
invited
confidence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
tell
you
something

*NL*
*NL*
``
About
Meg

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

you
guessed

Yes

about

though
it
's
a

it
fidgets
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Beth
is
asleep
;
speak
low

all
about
it

That

here

asked
Mrs.

rather
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
should
have
shut
the
door
in
his
face
if

said
Jo
,
*NL*
settling
herself
on
the
floor
at
her
mother
's
feet
.
``
Last
summer
Meg
*NL*
left
a
pair
of
gloves
over
at
the
Laurences

,
and
only
one
was
returned
.
*NL*
We
forgot
all
about
it
,
till
Teddy
told
me
that
Mr.
Brooke
had
it
.
He
*NL*
kept
it
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
,
and
once
it
fell
out
,
and
Teddy
joked
*NL*
him
about
it
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
owned
that
he
liked
Meg
,
but
did
n't
dare
*NL*
say
so
,
she
was
so
young
and
he
so
poor
.
Now
,
is
n't
it
a
_
dread_ful
*NL*
state
of
things
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
Meg
cares
for
him

asked
Mrs.
March
,
with
an
anxious
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
me
!
I
do
n't
know
anything
about
love

such
nonsense

cried
*NL*
Jo
,
with
a
funny
mixture
of
interest
and
contempt
.
``
In
novels

the
girls
*NL*
show
it
by
starting
and
blushing

fainting
away
,
growing
thin
,

acting
like
fools

Now
Meg
does
not
do
anything
of
the
sort
:
she
eats
*NL*
and
drinks
and
sleeps
,
like
a
sensible
creature

she
looks
straight
in

my
face
when
I
talk
about
that
man

only
blushes
a
little
bit
when

Teddy
jokes
about
lovers

I
forbid

do
it

he
does

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

cried
Jo

staring

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.

to
go
petting

helping

just
to

Jo
pulled
her

again
with
a
wrathful
tweak

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

John
went
with

at
Mr.

was
so
devoted
to
poor

father

we
could

getting
fond

He
was
perfectly
open

honorable

he
told
us
he
loved
her
,
but
would
earn
a
*NL*
comfortable
home
before
he
asked
her
to
marry
him

He
only
wanted
our
*NL*
leave
to
love
her
and
work
for
her
,
and
the
right
to
make
her
love
him
*NL*
if
he
could

He
is
a
truly
excellent
young
man
,
and
we
could
not
refuse
*NL*
to
listen
to
him

I
will
not

Meg

engaging
herself

young

``
Of

now
it

worse

This
odd

made
Mrs.

smile

she
said
gravely

I

confide
in

When

read

the
short

pinched

break

Jo
leaned

chin
on

John

business
,
and
not
tell
Meg
a
word
of
it
,
but
all
be
happy
together
as
we
*NL*
always
have
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
wrong
to
sigh
,
Jo
.
It
is
natural
and
right
you
should
all
go
to
*NL*
homes
of
your
own
,
in
time
;
but
I
do
want
to
keep
my
girls
as
long
as
I
*NL*
can
;
and
I
am
sorry
that
this
happened
so
soon
,
for
Meg
is
only
*NL*
seventeen
,
and
it
will
be
some
years
before
John
can
make
a
home
for
*NL*
her
.
Your
father
and
I
have
agreed
that
she
shall
not
bind
herself
in
*NL*
any
way
,
nor
be
married
,
before
twenty
.
If
she
and
John
love
one
*NL*
another
,
they
can
wait
,
and
test
the
love
by
doing
so
.
She
is
*NL*
conscientious
,
and
I
have
no
fear
of
her
treating
him
unkindly
.
My
*NL*
pretty
,
tender-hearted
girl
!
I
hope
things
will
go
happily
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
n't
you
rather
have
her
marry
a
rich
man
?
''
asked
Jo
,
as
her
mother
's
*NL*
voice
faltered
a
little
over
the
last
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Money
is
a
good
and
useful
thing
,
Jo
;
and
I
hope
my
girls
will
never
*NL*
feel
the
need
of
it
too
bitterly
,
nor
be
tempted
by
too
much
.
I
should
*NL*
like
to
know
that
John
was
firmly
established
in
some
good
business
,
*NL*
which
gave
him
an
income
large
enough
to
keep
free
from
debt
and
make
*NL*
Meg
comfortable
.
I
'm
not
ambitious
for
a
splendid
fortune
,
a
fashionable
*NL*
position
,
or
a
great
name
for
my
girls
.
If
rank
and
money
come
with
*NL*
love
and
virtue
,
also
,
I
should
accept
them
gratefully
,
and
enjoy
your
*NL*
good
fortune
;
but
I
know
,
by
experience
,
how
much
genuine
happiness
can
*NL*
be
had
in
a
plain
little
house
,
where
the
daily
bread
is
earned
,
and
*NL*
some
privations
give
sweetness
to
the
few
pleasures
.
I
am
content
to
see
*NL*
Meg
begin
humbly
,
for
,
if
I
am
not
mistaken
,
she
will
be
rich
in
the
*NL*
possession
of
a
good
man
's
heart
,
and
that
is
better
than
a
fortune
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
mother
,
and
quite
agree
;
but
I
'm
disappointed
about
Meg
,
*NL*
for
I
'd
planned
to
have
her
marry
Teddy
by
and
by
,
and
sit
in
the
lap
of
*NL*
luxury
all
her
days
.
Would
n't
it
be
nice
?
''
asked
Jo
,
looking
up
,
with
a
*NL*
brighter
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
younger
than
she
,
you
know
,
''
began
Mrs.
March
;
but
Jo
broke
in
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
little
;
he
's
old
for
his
age
,
and
tall
;
and
can
be
quite
*NL*
grown-up
in
his
manners
if
he
likes
.
Then
he
's
rich
and
generous
and
*NL*
good
,
and
loves
us
all
;
and
_
I
_
say
it
's
a
pity
my
plan
is
spoilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
Laurie
is
hardly
grown
up
enough
for
Meg
,
and
altogether
too
*NL*
much
of
a
weathercock
,
just
now
,
for
any
one
to
depend
on
.
Do
n't
make
*NL*
plans
,
Jo
;
but
let
time
and
their
own
hearts
mate
your
friends
.
We
ca
n't
*NL*
meddle
safely
in
such
matters
,
and
had
better
not
get
`
romantic
*NL*
rubbish

as
you
call
it

into
our
heads

lest
it
spoil
our
friendship

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
;
but
I
hate
to
see
things
going
all
criss-cross
and
*NL*
getting
snarled
up
,
when
a
pull
here
and
a
snip
there
would
straighten
*NL*
it
out

I
wish
wearing
flat-irons
on

keep
us

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
that
about
flat-irons
and

asked
Meg
,
as
she
crept
into
*NL*
the
room
,
with
the
finished
letter
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
of
my
stupid
speeches

I
'm
going

Peggy

said
*NL*
Jo
,
unfolding
herself
,
like
an
animated
puzzle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
,
and
beautifully
written
.
Please
add
that
I
send
my
love
to
*NL*
John

said
Mrs.
March
,
as
she
glanced
over
the
letter
,
and
gave
it
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
call
him
`
John

?
''
asked
Meg
,
smiling
,
with
her
innocent
eyes
*NL*
looking
down
into
her
mother
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
has
been
like
a

to
us
,
and
we
are
very
fond
of
him

*NL*
replied
Mrs.

,
returning
the
look
with
a
keen
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
that

Good-night

was
Meg
's
quiet
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kiss
her
mother
gave
her
was
a
very
tender
one
;
and
,
as
she
went
*NL*
away
,
Mrs.

said
,
with
a
mixture
of
satisfaction
and
regret
,
``
She

LAURIE
MAKES
MISCHIEF
,
AND
JO
MAKES
PEACE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
face
was
a
study
next
day
,
for
the
secret
rather
weighed
upon
her
,
*NL*
and
she
found
it
hard
not
to
look
mysterious
and
important
.
Meg
observed
*NL*
it
,
but
did
not
trouble
herself
to
make
inquiries
,
for
she
had
learned
*NL*
that
the
best
way
to
manage
Jo
was
by
the
law
of
contraries
,
so
she
felt
*NL*
sure
of
being
told
everything
if
she
did
not
ask
.
She
was
rather
*NL*
surprised
,
therefore
,
when
the
silence
remained
unbroken
,
and
Jo
assumed
*NL*
a
patronizing
air
,
which
decidedly
aggravated
Meg
,
who
in
her
turn
*NL*
assumed
an
air
of
dignified
reserve
,
and
devoted
herself
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
This
left
Jo
to
her
own
devices
;
for
Mrs.
March
had
taken
her
place
as
*NL*
nurse
,
and
bade
her
rest
,
exercise
,
and
amuse
herself
after
her
long
*NL*
confinement
.
Amy
being
gone
,
Laurie
was
her
only
refuge
;
and
,
much
as
*NL*
she
enjoyed
his
society
,
she
rather
dreaded
him
just
then
,
for
he
was
an
*NL*
incorrigible
tease
,
and
she
feared
he
would
coax
her
secret
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
quite
right
,
for
the
mischief-loving
lad
no
sooner
suspected
a
*NL*
mystery
than
he
set
himself
to
find
it
out
,
and
led
Jo
a
trying
life
of
*NL*
it
.
He
wheedled
,
bribed
,
ridiculed
,
threatened
,
and
scolded
;
affected
*NL*
indifference
,
that
he
might
surprise
the
truth
from
her
;
declared
he
*NL*
knew
,
then
that
he
did
n't
care
;
and
,
at
last
,
by
dint
of
perseverance
,
*NL*
he
satisfied
himself
that
it
concerned
Meg
and
Mr.
Brooke
.
Feeling
*NL*
indignant
that
he
was
not
taken
into
his
tutor
's
confidence
,
he
set
his
*NL*
wits
to
work
to
devise
some
proper
retaliation
for
the
slight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
meanwhile
had
apparently
forgotten
the
matter
,
and
was
absorbed
in
*NL*
preparations
for
her
father
's
return
;
but
all
of
a
sudden
a
change
*NL*
seemed
to
come
over
her
,
and
,
for
a
day
or
two
,
she
was
quite
unlike
*NL*
herself
.
She
started
when
spoken
to
,
blushed
when
looked
at
,
was
very
*NL*
quiet
,
and
sat
over
her
sewing
,
with
a
timid
,
troubled
look
on
her
face
.
*NL*
To
her
mother
's
inquiries
she
answered
that
she
was
quite
well
,
and
Jo
's
*NL*
she
silenced
by
begging
to
be
let
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
feels
it
in
the
air
--
love
,
I
mean
--
and
she
's
going
very
fast
.
She
's
*NL*
got
most
of
the
symptoms
,
--
is
twittery
and
cross
,
does
n't
eat
,
lies
*NL*
awake
,
and
mopes
in
corners
.
I
caught
her
singing
that
song
he
gave
her
,
*NL*
and
once
she
said
`
John
,
'
as
you
do
,
and
then
turned
as
red
as
a
poppy
.
*NL*
Whatever
shall
we
do
?
''
said
Jo
,
looking
ready
for
any
measures
,
however
*NL*
violent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
but
wait
.
Let
her
alone
,
be
kind
and
patient
,
and
father
's
*NL*
coming
will
settle
everything

replied
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
note
to
you

Meg

all
sealed
up

How
odd
!
Teddy
never
seals

mine

said
Jo
,
next
day
,
as
she
distributed
the
contents
of
the
little
*NL*
post-office
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
and
Jo
were
deep
in
their
own
affairs
,
when
a
sound
from
Meg
*NL*
made
them
look
up
to
see
her
staring
at
her
note
,
with
a
frightened
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
child
,
what
is
it
?
''
cried
her
mother
,
running
to
her
,
while
Jo
tried
*NL*
to
take
the
paper
which
had
done
the
mischief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
a
mistake

he
did
n't
send
it

O
Jo
,
how
could
you

?

and
*NL*
Meg
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
,
crying
as
if
her
heart
was
quite
broken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
I
've
done
nothing

What
's
she
talking
about
?
''
cried
Jo
,
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
's
mild
eyes
kindled
with
anger
as
she
pulled
a
crumpled
note
from
*NL*
her
pocket
,
and
threw
it
at
Jo
,
saying
reproachfully
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wrote
it

bad

cruel

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
hardly
heard
her
,
for
she
and
her
mother
were
reading
the
note

*NL*
was
written
in
a
peculiar

nothing

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
smiled
,
as
if
well
pleased
,
and
Jo
clapped
her
hands
,
*NL*
exclaiming
,
with
a
laugh
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
almost
equal
to
Caroline
Percy
,
who
was
a
pattern
of
prudence
!
*NL*
Tell
on

What
did
he
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
writes
in
a
different
way
entirely
,
telling
me
that
he
never
sent
*NL*
any
love-letter
at
all
,
and
is
very
sorry
that
my
roguish
sister
,
Jo
,
*NL*
should
take
such
liberties
with
our
names
.
It
's
very
kind
and
*NL*
respectful
,
but
think
how
dreadful
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
leaned
against
her
mother
,
looking
the
image
of
despair
,
and
Jo
*NL*
tramped
about
the
room
,
calling
Laurie
names
.
All
of
a
sudden
she
*NL*
stopped
,
caught
up
the
two
notes
,
and
,
after
looking
at
them
closely
,
*NL*
said
decidedly
,
``
I
do
n't
believe
Brooke
ever
saw
either
of
these
*NL*
letters

Teddy
wrote
both
,
and

yours
to
crow
over
me
with
,
because
*NL*
I
would
n't
tell
him
my
secret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
have
any
secrets
,
Jo
;
tell
it
to
mother
,
and
keep
out
of
trouble
,
*NL*
as
I
should
have
done
,

said
Meg
warningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you
,
child
!
Mother
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
Jo

I
'll
comfort
Meg
while
you
go
and
get
Laurie

I
shall
*NL*
sift
the
matter
to
the
bottom
,
and
put
a
stop
to
such
pranks
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Away
ran
Jo
,
and
Mrs.
March
gently
told
Meg
Mr.
Brooke
's
real
feelings
.
*NL*
``
Now
,
dear
,
what
are
your
own
?
Do
you
love
him
enough
to
wait
till
he
*NL*
can
make
a
home
for
you
,
or
will
you
keep
yourself
quite
free
for
the
*NL*
present
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
so
scared
and
worried
,
I
do
n't
want
to
have
anything
to
do
*NL*
with
lovers
for
a
long
while
,
--
perhaps
never
,
''
answered
Meg
petulantly
.
*NL*
``
If
John
_
does
n't
_
know
anything
about
this
nonsense
,
do
n't
tell
him
,
*NL*
and
make
Jo
and
Laurie
hold
their
tongues
.
I
wo
n't
be
deceived
and
*NL*
plagued
and
made
a
fool
of
,
--
it
's
a
shame
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
that
Meg
's
usually
gentle
temper
was
roused
and
her
pride
hurt
by
*NL*
this
mischievous
joke
,
Mrs.
March
soothed
her
by
promises
of
entire
*NL*
silence
,
and
great
discretion
for
the
future
.
The
instant
Laurie
's
step
*NL*
was
heard
in
the
hall
,
Meg
fled
into
the
study
,
and
Mrs.
March
received
*NL*
the
culprit
alone
.
Jo
had
not
told
him
why
he
was
wanted
,
fearing
he
*NL*
would
n't
come
;
but
he
knew
the
minute
he
saw
Mrs.
March
's
face
,
and
*NL*
stood
twirling
his
hat
,
with
a
guilty
air
which
convicted
him
at
once
.
*NL*
Jo
was
dismissed
,
but
chose
to
march
up
and
down
the
hall
like
a
*NL*
sentinel
,
having
some
fear
that
the
prisoner
might
bolt
.
The
sound
of
*NL*
voices
in
the
parlor
rose
and
fell
for
half
an
hour
;
but
what
happened
*NL*
during
that
interview
the
girls
never
knew
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
called
in
,
Laurie
was
standing
by
their
mother
,
with
such
*NL*
a
penitent
face
that
Jo
forgave
him
on
the
spot
,
but
did
not
think
it
*NL*
wise
to
betray
the
fact
.
Meg
received
his
humble
apology
,
and
was
much
*NL*
comforted
by
the
assurance
that
Brooke
knew
nothing
of
the
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
never
tell
him
to
my
dying
day
,
--
wild
horses
sha
'n'
t
drag
it
out
*NL*
of
me
;
so
you
'll
forgive
me
,
Meg
,
and
I
'll
do
anything
to
show
how
*NL*
out-and-out
sorry
I
am
,
''
he
added
,
looking
very
much
ashamed
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
;
but
it
was
a
very
ungentlemanly
thing
to
do
.
I
did
n't
think
*NL*
you
could
be
so
sly
and
malicious
,
Laurie
,
''
replied
Meg
,
trying
to
hide
*NL*
her
maidenly
confusion
under
a
gravely
reproachful
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
altogether
abominable
,
and
I
do
n't
deserve
to
be
spoken
to
for
a
*NL*
month
;
but
you
will
,
though
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
and
Laurie
folded
his
hands
*NL*
together
with
such
an
imploring
gesture
,
as
he
spoke
in
his
irresistibly
*NL*
persuasive
tone
,
that
it
was
impossible
to
frown
upon
him
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
scandalous
behavior
.
Meg
pardoned
him
,
and
Mrs.
March
's
grave
face
*NL*
relaxed
,
in
spite
of
her
efforts
to
keep
sober
,
when
she
heard
him
*NL*
declare
that
he
would
atone
for
his
sins
by
all
sorts
of
penances
,
and
*NL*
abase
himself
like
a
worm
before
the
injured
damsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
stood
aloof
,
meanwhile
,
trying
to
harden
her
heart
against
him
,
and
*NL*
succeeding
only
in
primming
up
her
face
into
an
expression
of
entire
*NL*
disapprobation
.
Laurie
looked
at
her
once
or
twice
,
but
,
as
she
showed
*NL*
no
sign
of
relenting
,
he
felt
injured
,
and
turned
his
back
on
her
till
*NL*
the
others
were
done
with
him
,
when
he
made
her
a
low
bow
,
and
walked
*NL*
off
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
had
gone
,
she
wished
she
had
been
more
forgiving
;
and
when
*NL*
Meg
and
her
mother
went
upstairs
,
she
felt
lonely
,
and
longed
for
Teddy
.
*NL*
After
resisting
for
some
time
,
she
yielded
to
the
impulse
,
and
,
armed
*NL*
with
a
book
to
return
,
went
over
to
the
big
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Mr.
Laurence
in
?
''
asked
Jo
,
of
a
housemaid
,
who
was
coming
down
*NL*
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
do
n't
believe

seeable

*NL*
*NL*
``

ill

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

a
scene
with

his
tantrums
about
something

which
vexes
the

*NL*
``
Where

*NL*
*NL*
Up
went
Jo
,
and
knocked
smartly
on
the
door
of
Laurie
's
little
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
that

I
'll
open

called
out
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
,
in
a
threatening
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
immediately
knocked
again
;
the
door
flew
open
,
and
in
she
bounced
,
*NL*
before
Laurie
could
recover
from
his
surprise
.
Seeing
that
he
really
*NL*
_
was
_
out
of
temper
,
Jo
,
who
knew
how
to
manage
him
,
assumed
a
contrite
*NL*
expression
,
and
going
artistically
down
upon
her
knees
,
said
meekly
,
*NL*
``
Please

wild
as

it

tired

thoughts

blended
temptingly
with

liberty

kindled
as

turned
wistfully
toward

window

they
fell
on
the

her

sorrowful
decision

*NL*

wet-blanket
such
a
proposal
,
but
I
thought
you
had
*NL*
more
spirit
,
''
began
Laurie
insinuatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bad
boy
,
be
quiet
!
Sit
down
and
think
of
your
own
sins
,
do
n't
go
making
*NL*
me
add
to
mine
.
If
I
get
your
grandpa
to
apologize
for
the
shaking
,
will
*NL*
you
give
up
running
away
?
''
asked
Jo
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
you
wo
n't
do
it
,
''
answered
Laurie
,
who
wished
``
to
make
up
,
''
*NL*
but
felt
that
his
outraged
dignity
must
be
appeased
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
can
manage
the
young
one
I
can
the
old
one
,
''
muttered
Jo
,
as
she
*NL*
walked
away
,
leaving
Laurie
bent
over
a
railroad
map
,
with
his
head
*NL*
propped
up
on
both
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
in
!
''
and
Mr.
Laurence
's
gruff
voice
sounded
gruffer
than
ever
,
as
*NL*
Jo
tapped
at
his
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
only
me
,
sir
,
come
to
return
a
book
,
''
she
said
blandly
,
as
she
*NL*
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Want
any
more
?
''
asked
the
old
gentleman
,
looking
grim
and
vexed
,
but
*NL*
trying
not
to
show
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
.
I
like
old
Sam
so
well
,
I
think
I
'll
try
the
second
*NL*
volume
,
''
returned
Jo
,
hoping
to
propitiate
him
by
accepting
a
second
*NL*
dose
of
Boswell
's
``
Johnson
,
''
as
he
had
recommended
that
lively
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shaggy
eyebrows
unbent
a
little
,
as
he
rolled
the
steps
toward
the
*NL*
shelf
where
the
Johnsonian
literature
was
placed
.
Jo
skipped
up
,
and
,
*NL*
sitting
on
the
top
step
,
affected
to
be
searching
for
her
book
,
but
was
*NL*
really
wondering
how
best
to
introduce
the
dangerous
object
of
her
*NL*
visit
.
Mr.
Laurence
seemed
to
suspect
that
something
was
brewing
in
her
*NL*
mind
;
for
,
after
taking
several
brisk
turns
about
the
room
,
he
faced
*NL*
round
on
her
,
speaking
so
abruptly
that
``
Rasselas
''
tumbled
face
downward
*NL*
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
has
that
boy
been
about
?
Do
n't
try
to
shield
him
.
I
know
he
has
*NL*
been
in
mischief
by
the
way
he
acted
when
he
came
home
.
I
ca
n't
get
a
*NL*
word
from
him
;
and
when
I
threatened
to
shake
the
truth
out
of
him
he
*NL*
bolted
upstairs
,
and
locked
himself
into
his
room
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
do
wrong
,
but
we
forgave
him
,
and
all
promised
not
to
say
a
word
*NL*
to
any
one

began
Jo
reluctantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo
n't
do

he
shall
not
shelter
himself
behind
a
promise
from
you

soft-hearted

If
he
's
done
anything
amiss

he
shall
confess

be
punished

Out

Jo

I
wo
n't
be
kept
in

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
looked
so
alarming
and
spoke
so
sharply
that
Jo
would
have
*NL*
gladly
run
away
,
if
she
could
,
but
she
was
perched
aloft
on
the
steps
,
*NL*
and
he
stood
at
the
foot
,
a
lion
in
the
path
,
so
she
had
to
stay
and
*NL*
brave
it
out

Indeed

Laurie

and
been
punished
quite
enough
.
We
do

keep
silence
to
*NL*
shield
him
,
but
some
one
else
,
and
it
will
make
more
trouble
if
you
*NL*
interfere

Please
do

;
it
was
partly
my
fault

but
it
's
all
right

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
threat
sounded
awful
,
but
did
not
alarm
Jo
,
for
she
knew
the
*NL*
irascible
old
gentleman
would
never
lift
a
finger
against
his
grandson
,
*NL*
whatever
he
might
say
to
the
contrary

She
obediently
descended
,
and
*NL*
made
as
light
of
the
prank
as
she
could
without
betraying
Meg
or
*NL*
forgetting
the

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Mr.

,
rubbing
up
his
hair
till
it
looked
as
if
he

had
been
out
in
a
gale
,

smoothing
the
frown
from
his

with
an

air
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Jo
,
trying
to
say
a
kind
word
for
her
*NL*
friend
,
who
seemed
to
get
out
of
one
scrape
only
to
fall
into
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
I

was
the
sharp
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
no

sir
;
you
are
rather
too
kind
sometimes

and
then
just
a

trifle
hasty
when
he
tries
your
patience
.
Do
n't
you
think
you
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
was
determined
to
have
it
out
now
,
and
tried
to
look
quite
placid
,
*NL*
though
she
quaked
a
little
after
her
bold
speech
.
To
her
great
relief
*NL*
and
surprise
,
the
old
gentleman
only
threw
his
spectacles
on
to
the
*NL*
table
with
a
rattle
,
and
exclaimed
frankly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
,
girl
,
I
am
!
I
love
the
boy
,

he
tries
my
patience
past

bearing
,

I
do
n't
know
how
it
will
end
,
if
we
go
on
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you

he
'll
run
away

''
Jo
was
sorry
for
that
speech
the
*NL*
minute
it
was
made
;
she
meant
to
warn
him
that
Laurie
would
not
bear
*NL*
much
restraint
,
and
hoped
he
would
be
more
forbearing
with
the
lad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
's
ruddy
face
changed
suddenly
,
and
he
sat
down
,
with
a
*NL*
troubled
glance
at
the
picture
of
a
handsome
man
,
which
hung
over
his
*NL*
table
.
It
was
Laurie
's
father
,
who
_
had
_
run
away
in
his
youth
,
and
*NL*
married
against
the
imperious
old
man
's
will
.
Jo
fancied
he
remembered
*NL*
and
regretted
the
past
,
and
she
wished
she
had
held
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't
do
it
unless
he
is
very
much
worried
,
and
only
threatens
it
*NL*
sometimes
,
when
he
gets
tired
of
studying
.
I
often
think
I
should
like
*NL*
to
,
especially
since
my
hair
was
cut
;
so
,
if
you
ever
miss
us
,
you
may
*NL*
advertise
for
two
boys
,
and
look
among
the
ships
bound
for
India
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
as
she
spoke
,
and
Mr.
Laurence
looked
relieved
,
evidently
*NL*
taking
the
whole
as
a
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

how
dare
you
talk
in
that
way

Where
's
your
respect
for
me

your

Bless
the
boys

!
What
torments
*NL*
they
are
;
yet
we
ca
n't
do
without
them

he
said
,
pinching
her
cheeks
*NL*
good-humoredly
.
``
Go

bring
that

down

him
not

put

grandfather

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

he
feels
badly

said
he

n't
tell

I
think
the
shaking
hurt
his
feelings
very
*NL*
much

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
tried
to
look
pathetic
,
but
must
have
failed
,
for
Mr.
Laurence
began
*NL*
to
laugh
,
and
she
knew
the
day
was
won
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sorry
for
that
,

ought
to
thank
him
for
not
shaking
me

I
*NL*
suppose

What
the
dickens
does
the
fellow
expect
?
''
and
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
looked
a
trifle
ashamed
of
his
own
testiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
you

I
'd
write
him
an
apology

says
he
wo

*NL*
down
till
he
has
one
,
and
talks
about
Washington
,
and
goes
on
in
an
*NL*
absurd
way
.
A
formal
apology
will
make
him
see
how
foolish
he
is
,
and
*NL*
bring
him
down
quite
amiable
.
Try
it
;
he
likes
fun
,
and
this
way
is
*NL*
better
than
talking

I
'll
carry
it
up
,
and
teach
him
his
duty

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
gave
her
a
sharp
look
,
and
put
on
his
spectacles
,
saying
*NL*
slowly
,
``
You
're
a
sly
puss
,
but
I
do
n't
mind
being
managed
by
you
and
*NL*

Here
,
give
me
a
bit
of
paper
,
and
let
us
have
done
with
this
*NL*
nonsense

*NL*
*NL*
The
note
was
written
in
the
terms
which
one
gentleman
would
use
to
*NL*
another
after
offering
some
deep
insult
.
Jo
dropped
a
kiss
on
the
top
of
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
's
bald
head
,
and
ran
up
to
slip
the
apology
under
Laurie
's
*NL*
door
,
advising
him
,
through
the
key-hole
,
to
be
submissive
,
decorous
,
*NL*
and
a
few
other
agreeable
impossibilities
.
Finding
the
door
locked
*NL*
again
,
she
left
the
note
to
do
its
work
,
and
was
going
quietly
away
,
*NL*
when
the
young
gentleman
slid
down
the
banisters
,
and
waited
for
her
at
*NL*
the
bottom
,
saying
,
with
his
most
virtuous
expression
of
countenance
,
*NL*
``
What
a
good
fellow
you
are

Jo
!
Did
you
get
blown
up

he
added
,
*NL*
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

was
pretty
mild

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

it
all
round

felt

just
ready

go

he
began
apologetically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

whisked
out

*NL*
``

quoting

as
he

went
to
partake
of
humble-pie
dutifully
with
his

who
was

quite

overwhelmingly
respectful
in

all
the

rest

Every

thought
the

blown

the

was
done

for

though
others
forgot
it

Meg
remembered

She
*NL*
never
alluded
to
a
certain
person

she
thought
of
him
a
good

*NL*
dreamed
dreams
more
than
ever

and
once
Jo
,
rummaging
her
sister

desk
*NL*
for
stamps
,
found
a
bit
of
paper
scribbled
over
with
the
words
,
``
Mrs.

''
whereat
she
groaned
tragically
,
and
cast
it
into

fire

*NL*
feeling
that

prank

hastened
the
evil

Like

after

were
the
peaceful
weeks

followed

The
*NL*
invalids
improved
rapidly
,
and
Mr.
March
began
to
talk
of
returning
*NL*
early
in
the
new

Beth
was
soon
able
to
lie
on
the
study
sofa
all

day
,
amusing
herself
with
the
well-beloved
cats
,
at
first

and
,
in
time
,
*NL*
with
doll
's
sewing
,
which
had
fallen
sadly
behindhand
.
Her
once
active
*NL*
limbs
were
so
stiff
and
feeble
that
Jo
took
her
a
daily
airing
about
the
*NL*
house
in
her
strong
arms
.
Meg
cheerfully
blackened
and
burnt
her
white
*NL*
hands
cooking
delicate
messes
for
``
the

''
while
Amy
,
a
loyal
slave
*NL*
of

celebrated
her
return
by
giving
away
as
many
of
her
*NL*
treasures
as
she
could
prevail
on
her
sisters
to
accept
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Christmas
approached
,
the
usual
mysteries
began
to
haunt
the
house
,
*NL*
and
Jo
frequently
convulsed
the
family
by
proposing
utterly
impossible
*NL*
or
magnificently
absurd
ceremonies
,
in
honor
of
this
unusually
merry
*NL*
Christmas

Laurie
was
equally

would
have
had
*NL*
bonfires
,
sky-rockets
,
and
triumphal
arches
,
if
he

his
own
way

*NL*
After
many
skirmishes
and
snubbings
,
the
ambitious
pair
were
considered
*NL*
effectually
quenched
,
and
went
about
with
forlorn
faces

which
were
*NL*
rather
belied
by
explosions

Several

Hannah

that

she
proved
herself
a
true
prophetess
,
for
*NL*
everybody
and
everything
seemed
bound
to
produce
a
grand
success
.
To
*NL*
begin
with
,
Mr.
March
wrote
that
he
should
soon
be
with
them
;
then
Beth
*NL*
felt
uncommonly
well
that
morning
,
and
,
being
dressed
in
her
mother
's
*NL*
gift
,
--
a
soft
crimson
merino
wrapper
,
--
was
borne
in
triumph
to
the
*NL*
window
to
behold
the
offering
of
Jo
and
Laurie
.
The
Unquenchables
had
*NL*
done
their
best
to
be
worthy
of
the
name
,
for
,
like
elves
,
they
had
*NL*
worked
by
night
,
and
conjured
up
a
comical
surprise
.
Out
in
the
garden
*NL*
stood
a
stately
snow-maiden
,
crowned
with
holly
,
bearing
a
basket
of
*NL*
fruit
and
flowers
in
one
hand
,
a
great
roll
of
new
music
in
the
other
,
a
*NL*
perfect
rainbow
of
an
Afghan
round
her
chilly
shoulders
,
and
a
Christmas
*NL*
carol
issuing
from
her
lips

on
a
pink
paper

How
Beth
laughed
when
she
saw
it
,
how
Laurie
ran
up
and
down
to
bring
in
*NL*
the
gifts
,
and
what
ridiculous
speeches
Jo
made
as
she
presented
them
!
*NL*
*NL*
``

here

I
could

one
drop
more

''
said
Beth
,
quite
sighing
with
contentment
as
Jo
*NL*
carried
her
off
to
the
study
to
rest
after
the
excitement
,
and
to
*NL*
refresh
herself
with
some
of
the
delicious
grapes
the
``
Jungfrau
''
had
*NL*
sent
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
am
I

''
added
Jo
,
slapping
the
pocket
wherein
reposed
the
*NL*
long-desired
Undine
and
Sintram
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
am
,
''
echoed
Amy
,
poring
over
the
engraved
copy
of
the
*NL*
Madonna
and
Child
,
which
her
mother
had
given
her
,
in
a
pretty
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
am
!
''
cried
Meg
,
smoothing
the
silvery
folds
of
her
first
*NL*
silk
dress
;
for
Mr.
Laurence
had
insisted
on
giving
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
_
I
_
be
otherwise
?
''
said
Mrs.
March
gratefully
,
as
her
eyes
went
*NL*
from
her
husband
's
letter
to
Beth
's
smiling
face
,
and
her
hand
caressed
*NL*
the
brooch
made
of
gray
and
golden
,
chestnut
and
dark
brown
hair
,
which
*NL*
the
girls
had
just
fastened
on
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
and
then
,
in
this
work-a-day
world
,
things
do
happen
in
the
*NL*
delightful
story-book
fashion
,
and
what
a
comfort
that
is
.
Half
an
hour
*NL*
after
every
one
had
said
they
were
so
happy
they
could
only
hold
one
*NL*
drop
more
,
the
drop
came
.
Laurie
opened
the
parlor
door
,
and
popped
his
*NL*
head
in
very
quietly
.
He
might
just
as
well
have
turned
a
somersault
and
*NL*
uttered
an
Indian
war-whoop
;
for
his
face
was
so
full
of
suppressed
*NL*
excitement
and
his
voice
so
treacherously
joyful
,
that
every
one
jumped
*NL*
up
,
though
he
only
said
,
in
a
queer
,
breathless
voice
,
``
Here
's
another
*NL*
Christmas
present
for
the
March
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
words
were
well
out
of
his
mouth
,
he
was
whisked
away
*NL*
somehow
,
and
in
his
place
appeared
a
tall
man
,
muffled
up
to
the
eyes
,
*NL*
leaning
on
the
arm
of
another
tall
man
,
who
tried
to
say
something
and
*NL*
could
n't
.
Of
course
there
was
a
general
stampede
;
and
for
several
*NL*
minutes
everybody
seemed
to
lose
their
wits
,
for
the
strangest
things
*NL*
were
done
,
and
no
one
said
a
word
.
Mr.
March
became
invisible
in
the
*NL*
embrace
of
four
pairs
of
loving
arms
;
Jo
disgraced
herself
by
nearly
*NL*
fainting
away
,
and
had
to
be
doctored
by
Laurie
in
the
china-closet
;
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
kissed
Meg
entirely
by
mistake
,
as
he
somewhat
incoherently
*NL*
explained
;
and
Amy
,
the
dignified
,
tumbled
over
a
stool
,
and
,
never
*NL*
stopping
to
get
up
,
hugged
and
cried
over
her
father
's
boots
in
the
most
*NL*
touching
manner
.
Mrs.
March
was
the
first
to
recover
herself
,
and
held
*NL*
up
her
hand
with
a
warning
,
``
Hush
!
remember
Beth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
too
late
;
the
study
door
flew
open
,
the
little
red
wrapper
*NL*
appeared
on
the
threshold
,
--
joy
put
strength
into
the
feeble
limbs
,
--
and
*NL*
Beth
ran
straight
into
her
father
's
arms
.
Never
mind
what
happened
just
*NL*
after
that
;
for
the
full
hearts
overflowed
,
washing
away
the
bitterness
*NL*
of
the
past
,
and
leaving
only
the
sweetness
of
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
at
all
romantic
,
but
a
hearty
laugh
set
everybody
straight
*NL*
again
,
for
Hannah
was
discovered
behind
the
door
,
sobbing
over
the
fat
*NL*
turkey
,
which
she
had
forgotten
to
put
down
when
she
rushed
up
from
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
As
the
laugh
subsided
,
Mrs.
March
began
to
thank
Mr.
Brooke
for
*NL*
his
faithful
care
of
her
husband
,
at
which
Mr.
Brooke
suddenly
*NL*
remembered
that
Mr.
March
needed
rest
,
and
,
seizing
Laurie
,
he
*NL*
precipitately
retired
.
Then
the
two
invalids
were
ordered
to
repose
,
*NL*
which
they
did
,
by
both
sitting
in
one
big
chair
,
and
talking
hard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
March
told
how
he
had
longed
to
surprise
them
,
and
how
,
when
the
*NL*
fine
weather
came
,
he
had
been
allowed
by
his
doctor
to
take
advantage
*NL*
of
it
;
how
devoted
Brooke
had
been
,
and
how
he
was
altogether
a
most
*NL*
estimable
and
upright
young
man
.
Why
Mr.
March
paused
a
minute
just
*NL*
there
,
and
,
after
a
glance
at
Meg
,
who
was
violently
poking
the
fire
,
*NL*
looked
at
his
wife
with
an
inquiring
lift
of
the
eyebrows
,
I
leave
you
*NL*
to
imagine
;
also
why
Mrs.
March
gently
nodded
her
head
,
and
asked
,
*NL*
rather
abruptly
,
if
he
would
n't
have
something
to
eat
.
Jo
saw
and
*NL*
understood
the
look
;
and
she
stalked
grimly
away
to
get
wine
and
*NL*
beef-tea
,
muttering
to
herself
,
as
she
slammed
the
door
,
``
I
hate
*NL*
estimable
young
men
with
brown
eyes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
never
_
was
_
such
a
Christmas
dinner
as
they
had
that
day
.
The
fat
*NL*
turkey
was
a
sight
to
behold
,
when
Hannah
sent
him
up
,
stuffed
,
browned
,
*NL*
and
decorated
;
so
was
the
plum-pudding
,
which
quite
melted
in
one
's
*NL*
mouth
;
likewise
the
jellies
,
in
which
Amy
revelled
like
a
fly
in
a
*NL*
honey-pot
.
Everything
turned
out
well
,
which
was
a
mercy
,
Hannah
said
,
*NL*
``
For
my
mind
was
that
flustered
,
mum
,
that
it
's
a
merrycle
I
did
n't
*NL*
roast
the
pudding
,
and
stuff
the
turkey
with
raisins
,
let
alone
bilin
'
*NL*
of
it
in
a
cloth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Laurence
and
his
grandson
dined
with
them
,
also
Mr.
Brooke
,
--
at
whom
*NL*
Jo
glowered
darkly
,
to
Laurie
's
infinite
amusement
.
Two
easy-chairs
*NL*
stood
side
by
side
at
the
head
of
the
table
,
in
which
sat
Beth
and
her
*NL*
father
,
feasting
modestly
on
chicken
and
a
little
fruit
.
They
drank
*NL*
healths
,
told
stories
,
sung
songs
,
``
reminisced
,
''
as
the
old
folks
say
,
*NL*
and
had
a
thoroughly
good
time
.
A
sleigh-ride
had
been
planned
,
but
the
*NL*
girls
would
not
leave
their
father
;
so
the
guests
departed
early
,
and
,
*NL*
as
twilight
gathered
,
the
happy
family
sat
together
round
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
a
year
ago
we
were
groaning
over
the
dismal
Christmas
we
expected
*NL*
to
have
.
Do
you
remember
?
''
asked
Jo
,
breaking
a
short
pause
which
had
*NL*
followed
a
long
conversation
about
many
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
a
pleasant
year
on
the
whole
!
''
said
Meg
,
smiling
at
the
fire
,
*NL*
and
congratulating
herself
on
having
treated
Mr.
Brooke
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
been
a
pretty
hard
one
,
''
observed
Amy
,
watching
the
light
*NL*
shine
on
her
ring
,
with
thoughtful
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
it
's
over
,
because
we
've
got
you
back
,
''
whispered
Beth
,
who
*NL*
sat
on
her
father
's
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
a
rough
road
for
you
to
travel
,
my
little
pilgrims
,
especially
*NL*
the
latter
part
of
it
.
But
you
have
got
on
bravely
;
and
I
think
the
*NL*
burdens
are
in
a
fair
way
to
tumble
off
very
soon
,
''
said
Mr.
March
,
*NL*
looking
with
fatherly
satisfaction
at
the
four
young
faces
gathered
*NL*
round
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
Did
mother
tell
you
?
''
asked
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
;
straws
show
which
way
the
wind
blows
,
and
I
've
made
several
*NL*
discoveries
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
tell
us
what
they
are
!
''
cried
Meg
,
who
sat
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
is
one
;
''
and
taking
up
the
hand
which
lay
on
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
*NL*
he
pointed
to
the
roughened
forefinger
,
a
burn
on
the
back
,
and
two
or
*NL*
three
little
hard
spots
on
the
palm
.
``
I
remember
a
time
when
this
hand
*NL*
was
white
and
smooth
,
and
your
first
care
was
to
keep
it
so
.
It
was
very
*NL*
pretty
then
,
but
to
me
it
is
much
prettier
now
,
--
for
in
these
seeming
*NL*
blemishes
I
read
a
little
history
.
A
burnt-offering
has
been
made
of
*NL*
vanity
;
this
hardened
palm
has
earned
something
better
than
blisters
;
*NL*
and
I
'm
sure
the
sewing
done
by
these
pricked
fingers
will
last
a
long
*NL*
time
,
so
much
good-will
went
into
the
stitches
.
Meg
,
my
dear
,
I
value
*NL*
the
womanly
skill
which
keeps
home
happy
more
than
white
hands
or
*NL*
fashionable
accomplishments
.
I
'm
proud
to
shake
this
good
,
industrious
*NL*
little
hand
,
and
hope
I
shall
not
soon
be
asked
to
give
it
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Meg
had
wanted
a
reward
for
hours
of
patient
labor
,
she
received
it
*NL*
in
the
hearty
pressure
of
her
father
's
hand
and
the
approving
smile
he
*NL*
gave
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
Jo
?
Please
say
something
nice
;
for
she
has
tried
so
hard
,
*NL*
and
been
so
very
,
very
good
to
me
,
''
said
Beth
,
in
her
father
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
laughed
,
and
looked
across
at
the
tall
girl
who
sat
opposite
,
with
an
*NL*
unusually
mild
expression
in
her
brown
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
spite
of
the
curly
crop
,
I
do
n't
see
the
`
son
Jo
'
whom
I
left
a
year
*NL*
ago
,
''
said
Mr.
March
.
``
I
see
a
young
lady
who
pins
her
collar
straight
,
*NL*
laces
her
boots
neatly
,
and
neither
whistles
,
talks
slang
,
nor
lies
on
*NL*
the
rug
as
she
used
to
do
.
Her
face
is
rather
thin
and
pale
,
just
now
,
*NL*
with
watching
and
anxiety
;
but
I
like
to
look
at
it
,
for
it
has
grown
*NL*
gentler
,
and
her
voice
is
lower
;
she
does
n't
bounce
,
but
moves
quietly
,
*NL*
and
takes
care
of
a
certain
little
person
in
a
motherly
way
which
*NL*
delights
me
.
I
rather
miss
my
wild
girl
;
but
if
I
get
a
strong
,
helpful
,
*NL*
tender-hearted
woman
in
her
place
,
I
shall
feel
quite
satisfied
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
whether
the
shearing
sobered
our
black
sheep
,
but
I
do
know
that
in
*NL*
all
Washington
I
could
n't
find
anything
beautiful
enough
to
be
bought
*NL*
with
the
five-and-twenty
dollars
which
my
good
girl
sent
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
keen
eyes
were
rather
dim
for
a
minute
,
and
her
thin
face
grew
rosy
*NL*
in
the
firelight
,
as
she
received
her
father
's
praise
,
feeling
that
she
*NL*
did
deserve
a
portion
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
Beth
,
''
said
Amy
,
longing
for
her
turn
,
but
ready
to
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
so
little
of
her
,
I
'm
afraid
to
say
much
,
for
fear
she
will
*NL*
slip
away
altogether
,
though
she
is
not
so
shy
as
she
used
to
be
,
''
began
*NL*
their
father
cheerfully
;
but
recollecting
how
nearly
he
_
had
_
lost
her
,
*NL*
he
held
her
close
,
saying
tenderly
,
with
her
cheek
against
his
own
,
*NL*
``
I
've
got
you
safe
,
my
Beth
,
and
I
'll
keep
you
so
,
please
God

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
minute
's
silence
,
he
looked
down
at
Amy
,
who
sat
on
the
cricket
*NL*
at
his
feet
,
and
said
,
with
a

hair
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
observed
that
Amy
took
drumsticks
at
dinner
,
ran
errands
for
her
*NL*
mother
all
the
afternoon
,
gave
Meg
her
place
to-night
,
and
has
waited
*NL*
on
every
one
with
patience
and
good-humor
.
I
also
observe
that
she
does
*NL*
not
fret
much
nor
look
in
the
glass
,
and
has
not
even
mentioned
a
very
*NL*
pretty
ring
which
she
wears
;
so
I
conclude
that
she
has
learned
to
think
*NL*
of
other
people
more
and
of
herself
less
,
and
has
decided
to
try
and
*NL*
mould
her
character
as
carefully
as
she
moulds
her
little
clay
figures
.
*NL*
I
am
glad
of
this
;
for
though
I
should
be
very
proud
of
a
graceful
*NL*
statue
made
by
her
,
I
shall
be
infinitely
prouder
of
a
lovable
daughter
,
*NL*
with
a
talent
for
making
life
beautiful
to
herself
and
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
thinking
of
,
Beth
?
''
asked
Jo
,
when
Amy
had
thanked
her
*NL*
father
and
told
about
her
ring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
read
in
`
Pilgrim
's
Progress
'
to-day
,
how
,
after
many
troubles
,
*NL*
Christian
and
Hopeful
came
to
a
pleasant
green
meadow
,
where
lilies
*NL*
bloomed
all
the
year
round
,
and
there
they
rested
happily
,
as
we
do
now
,
*NL*
before
they
went
on
to
their
journey
's
end
,
''
answered
Beth
;
adding
,
as
*NL*
she
slipped
out
of
her
father
's
arms
,
and
went
slowly
to
the
instrument
,
*NL*
``
It
's
singing
time
now
,
and
I
want
to
be
in
my
old
place
.
I
'll
try
to
*NL*
sing
the
song
of
the
shepherd-boy
which
the
Pilgrims
heard
.
I
made
the
*NL*
music
for
father
,
because
he
likes
the
verses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
sitting
at
the
dear
little
piano
,
Beth
softly
touched
the
keys
,
and
,
*NL*
in
the
sweet
voice
they
had
never
thought
to
hear
again
,
sung
to
her
own
*NL*
accompaniment
the
quaint
hymn
,
which
was
a
singularly
fitting
song
for
*NL*
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
that
is
down
need
fear
no
fall
,
*NL*
He
that
is
low
no
pride
;
*NL*
He
that
is
humble
ever
shall
*NL*
Have
God
to
be
his
guide
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
content
with
what
I
have

*NL*
Little
be
it
or
much
;
*NL*
And
,
Lord

contentment
still
I
crave

*NL*
Because

*NL*
*NL*
``
Fulness

THE

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Like
bees
swarming
after
their
queen
,
mother
and
daughters
hovered
about
*NL*
Mr.
March
the
next
day
,
neglecting
everything
to
look
at
,
wait
upon
,
and
*NL*
listen
to
the
new
invalid
,
who
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
killed
by
*NL*
kindness
.
As
he
sat
propped
up
in
a
big
chair
by
Beth
's
sofa
,
with
the
*NL*
other
three
close
by
,
and
Hannah
popping
in
her
head
now
and
then
,
``
to
*NL*
peek
at
the
dear
man
,
''
nothing
seemed
needed
to
complete
their
*NL*
happiness
.
But
something
_
was
_
needed
,
and
the
elder
ones
felt
it
,
*NL*
though
none
confessed
the
fact
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
March
looked
at
one
another
*NL*
with
an
anxious
expression
,
as
their
eyes
followed
Meg
.
Jo
had
sudden
*NL*
fits
of
sobriety
,
and
was
seen
to
shake
her
fist
at
Mr.
Brooke
's
*NL*
umbrella
,
which
had
been
left
in
the
hall
;
Meg
was
absent-minded
,
shy
,
*NL*
and
silent
,
started
when
the
bell
rang
,
and
colored
when
John
's
name
was
*NL*
mentioned
;
Amy
said
``
Every
one
seemed
waiting
for
something
,
and
*NL*
could
n't
settle
down
,
which
was
queer
,
since
father
was
safe
at
home
,
''
*NL*
and
Beth
innocently
wondered
why
their
neighbors
did
n't
run
over
as
*NL*
usual
.

*NL*
Laurie
went
by
in
the
afternoon
,
and
,
seeing
Meg
at
the
window
,
seemed
*NL*
suddenly
possessed
with
a
melodramatic
fit
,
for
he
fell
down
upon
one
*NL*
knee
in
the
snow
,
beat
his
breast
,
tore
his
hair
,
and
clasped
his
hands
*NL*
imploringly
,
as
if
begging
some
boon
;
and
when
Meg
told
him
to
behave
*NL*
himself
and
go
away
,
he
wrung
imaginary
tears
out
of
his
handkerchief
,
*NL*
and
staggered
round
the
corner
as
if
in
utter
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
the
goose
mean
?
''
said
Meg
,
laughing
,
and
trying
to
look
*NL*
unconscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
showing
you
how
your
John
will
go
on
by

Touching

it
?

answered
Jo
scornfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
say
_
my
John
_
,
it
is
n't
proper
or
true
;

but
Meg
's
voice
lingered
*NL*
over
the
words
as
if
they
sounded
pleasant
to
her
.
``
Please
do
n't
plague
*NL*
me

Jo
;
I
've
told
you
I
do

care

about
him

and
there
is
n't
to
*NL*
be
anything

we
are
all
to
be
friendly

go
on
as
before

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
ca
n't

Laurie

mischief

spoilt
you
for

I
see
it

so
does

;
you
are
not

your
*NL*

I
do

hate

pettishly
.

*NL*

said
I
was
too
young

''
began
Meg
,
bending
over
her
work
,
with
a
*NL*
queer
little
smile
,
which
suggested
that
she
did
not
quite
agree
with
*NL*
her
father
on
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
did
speak
,
you
would
n't
know
what
to
say
,
but
would
cry
or
blush
,
*NL*
or
let
him
have
his
own
way

instead
of
giving
a
good
,
decided

No

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
so
silly
and
weak
as
you

I
know
just
what
I
should
say

for
I
've
planned
it
all
,
so
I
need
n't
be
taken
unawares
;
there
's
no
*NL*
knowing
what
may
happen
,
and
I
wished
to
be
prepared

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
could
n't
help
smiling
at
the
important
air
which
Meg
had
*NL*
unconsciously
assumed
,
and
which
was
as
becoming
as
the
pretty
color
*NL*
varying
in
her
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
mind
telling
me
what
you
'd
say
?
''
asked
Jo
more
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
;
you
are
sixteen
now
,
quite
old
enough
to
be
my
confidant
,
*NL*
and
my
experience
will
be
useful
to
you
by
and
by
,
perhaps
,
in
your
own
*NL*
affairs
of
this
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
mean
to
have
any
;
it
's
fun
to
watch
other
people
philander
,
but
I
*NL*
should
feel
like
a
fool
doing
it
myself
,
''
said
Jo
,
looking
alarmed
at
*NL*
the
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
if
you
liked
any
one
very
much
,
and
he
liked
you
.
''
Meg
*NL*
spoke
as
if
to
herself
,
and
glanced
out
at
the
lane
,
where
she
had
often
*NL*
seen
lovers
walking
together
in
the
summer
twilight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
going
to
tell
your
speech
to
that
man
,

said
Jo
,
*NL*
rudely
shortening
her
sister
's
little
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
should
merely
say
,
quite
calmly
and
decidedly
,
`
Thank
you
,
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
,
you
are
very
kind
,
but
I
agree
with
father
that
I
am
too
young
*NL*
to
enter
into
any
engagement
at
present
;
so
please
say
no
more
,
but
let
*NL*
us
be
friends
as
we
were
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
that
's
stiff
and
cool
enough
.
I
do
n't
believe
you
'll
ever
say
it
,
*NL*
and
I
know
he
wo
n't
be
satisfied
if
you
do
.
If
he
goes
on
like
the
*NL*
rejected
lovers
in
books
,
you
'll
give
in
,
rather
than
hurt
his
*NL*
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't

I
shall
tell
him
I
've
made
up
my
mind

and
shall
walk
out
*NL*
of
the
room
with
dignity
.

*NL*
*NL*
Meg
rose
as
she
spoke
,
and
was
just
going
to
rehearse
the
dignified
*NL*
exit
,
when
a
step
in
the
hall
made
her
fly
into
her
seat
,
and
begin
to
*NL*
sew
as
if
her
life
depended
on
finishing
that
particular
seam
in
a
given
*NL*
time
.
Jo
smothered
a
laugh
at
the
sudden
change
,
and
,
when
some
one
gave
*NL*
a
modest
tap
,
opened
the
door
with
a
grim
aspect
,
which
was
anything
but
*NL*
hospitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
afternoon

I
came
to
get
my
umbrella

that
is

to
see
how
your
*NL*
father
finds
himself
to-day

said
Mr.
Brooke
,
getting
a
trifle
confused
*NL*
as
his
eye
went
from
one
tell-tale
face
to
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
very
well

's
in

I
'll

are
*NL*
here
,
''
and
having
jumbled
her
father
and
the
umbrella
well
together
in
*NL*
her
reply
,
Jo
slipped
out
of
the
room
to
give
Meg
a
chance
to
make
her
*NL*
speech
and
air
her
dignity
.
But
the
instant
she
vanished
,
Meg
began
to
*NL*
sidle
towards
the
door
,
murmuring
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
will
like
to
see
you

sit
down

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go

are
you
afraid

and
Mr.
Brooke
looked
so
*NL*
hurt
that
Meg
thought
she
must
have
done
something
very
rude
.
She
*NL*
blushed
up
to
the
little
curls
on
her
forehead
,
for
he
had
never
called
*NL*
her
Margaret
before
,
and
she
was
surprised
to
find
how
natural
and
sweet
*NL*
it
seemed
to
hear
him
say
it
.
Anxious
to
appear
friendly
and
at
her
*NL*
ease
,
she
put
out
her
hand
with
a
confiding
gesture
,
and
said
*NL*
gratefully
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

asked
Mr.
Brooke
,
holding
the
small
hand
fast
in
*NL*
both
his
own
,
and
looking
down
at
Meg
with
so
much
love
in
the
brown
*NL*
eyes
,
that
her
heart
began
to
flutter
,
and
she
both
longed
to
run
away

and
to
stop
and
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

she
said
,
trying
to
withdraw
her

hand
,
and
looking
frightened
in
spite
of
her
denial
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Mr.

tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
moment
for
the
calm
,
proper
speech
,
but
Meg
did
n't
make
it
;
*NL*
she
forgot
every
word
of
it
,
hung
her
head
,
and
answered
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know

''
so
softly
,
that
John
had
to
stoop
down
to
catch
the
foolish
*NL*
little
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
to
think
it
was
worth
the
trouble
,
for
he
smiled
to
himself
as
*NL*
if
quite
satisfied
,
pressed
the
plump
hand
gratefully
,
and
said
,
in
his
*NL*
most
persuasive
tone
,
``
Will
you
try

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

faltered
Meg
,
wondering
why
she
was
so
fluttered

*NL*
rather
enjoying
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll

lesson

*NL*
``
Not

I
chose
to
learn
it

*NL*

broke
in
John
,
getting
possession
of
the
other
hand
,
so
that
*NL*
she
had
no
way
of
hiding
her
face
,
as
he
bent
to
look
into
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
tone
was
properly
beseeching
;
but
,
stealing
a
shy
look
at
him
,
Meg
*NL*
saw
that
his
eyes
were
merry
as
well
as
tender
,
and
that
he
wore
the
*NL*
satisfied
smile
of
one
who
had
no
doubt
of
his
success
.
This
nettled
*NL*
her
;
Annie
Moffat
's
foolish
lessons
in
coquetry
came
into
her
mind
,
and
*NL*
the
love
of
power
,
which
sleeps
in
the
bosoms
of
the
best
of
little
*NL*
women
,
woke
up
all
of
a
sudden
and
took
possession
of
her
.
She
felt
*NL*
excited
and
strange
,
and
,
not
knowing
what
else
to
do
,
followed
a
*NL*
capricious
impulse
,
and
,
withdrawing
her
hands
,
said
petulantly
,
``
I
*NL*
_
do
n't
_
choose
.
Please
go
away
and
let
me
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Mr.
Brooke
looked
as
if
his
lovely
castle
in
the
air
was
tumbling
*NL*
about
his
ears
,
for
he
had
never
seen
Meg
in
such
a
mood
before
,
and
it
*NL*
rather
bewildered
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
mean
that
?
''
he
asked
anxiously
,
following
her
as
she
*NL*
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
;
I
do
n't
want
to
be
worried
about
such
things
.
Father
says
I
*NL*
need
n't
;
it
's
too
soon
and
I
'd
rather
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
n't
I
hope
you
'll
change
your
mind
by
and
by
?
I
'll
wait
,
and
say
*NL*
nothing
till
you
have
had
more
time
.
Do
n't
play
with
me
,
Meg
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
think
that
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
of
me
at
all
.
I
'd
rather
you
would
n't
,
''
said
Meg
,
taking
a
*NL*
naughty
satisfaction
in
trying
her
lover
's
patience
and
her
own
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
grave
and
pale
now
,
and
looked
decidedly
more
like
the
novel
*NL*
heroes
whom
she
admired
;
but
he
neither
slapped
his
forehead
nor
tramped
*NL*
about
the
room
,
as
they
did
;
he
just
stood
looking
at
her
so
wistfully
,
*NL*
so
tenderly
,
that
she
found
her
heart
relenting
in
spite
of
her
.
What
*NL*
would
have
happened
next
I
can
not
say
,
if
Aunt
March
had
not
come
*NL*
hobbling
in
at
this
interesting
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
lady
could
n't
resist
her
longing
to
see
her
nephew
;
for
she
had
*NL*
met
Laurie
as
she
took
her
airing
,
and
,
hearing
of
Mr.
March
's
arrival
,
*NL*
drove
straight
out
to
see
him
.
The
family
were
all
busy
in
the
back
part
*NL*
of
the
house
,
and
she
had
made
her
way
quietly
in
,
hoping
to
surprise
*NL*
them
.
She
did
surprise
two
of
them
so
much
that
Meg
started
as
if
she
*NL*
had
seen
a
ghost
,
and
Mr.
Brooke
vanished
into
the
study
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
me
,
what
's
all
this
?
''
cried
the
old
lady
,
with
a
rap
of
her
cane
,
*NL*
as
she
glanced
from
the
pale
young
gentleman
to
the
scarlet
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
Bless
me
,
what
's
all
this
?
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
father
's
friend
.
I
'm
_
so
_
surprised
to
see
you
!
''
stammered
Meg
,
*NL*
feeling
that
she
was
in
for
a
lecture
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
evident
,
''
returned
Aunt
March
,
sitting
down
.
``
But
what
is
*NL*
father
's
friend
saying
to
make
you
look
like
a
peony
?
There
's
mischief
*NL*
going
on
,
and
I
insist
upon
knowing
what
it
is
,
''
with
another
rap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
merely
talking
.
Mr.
Brooke
came
for
his
umbrella
,
''
began
Meg
,
*NL*
wishing
that
Mr.
Brooke
and
the
umbrella
were
safely
out
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Brooke
?
That
boy
's
tutor
?
Ah
!
I
understand
now
.
I
know
all
about
it
.
Jo
*NL*
blundered
into
a
wrong
message
in
one
of
your
father
's
letters
,
and
I
*NL*
made
her
tell
me
.
You
have
n't
gone
and
accepted
him
,
child
?
''
cried
Aunt
*NL*
March
,
looking
scandalized
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
!
he
'll
hear
.
Sha
'n'
t
I
call
mother
?
''
said
Meg
,
much
troubled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
I
've
something
to
say
to
you
,
and
I
must
free
my
mind
at
once
.
*NL*
Tell
me
,
do
you
mean
to
marry
this
Cook
?
If
you
do
,
not
one
penny
of
my
*NL*
money
ever
goes
to
you
.
Remember
that
,
and
be
a
sensible
girl
,
''
said
the
*NL*
old
lady
impressively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Aunt
March
possessed
in
perfection
the
art
of
rousing
the
spirit
of
*NL*
opposition
in
the
gentlest
people
,
and
enjoyed
doing
it
.
The
best
of
us
*NL*
have
a
spice
of
perversity
in
us
,
especially
when
we
are
young
and
in
*NL*
love
.
If
Aunt
March
had
begged
Meg
to
accept
John
Brooke
,
she
would
*NL*
probably
have
declared
she
could
n't
think
of
it
;
but
as
she
was
*NL*
peremptorily
ordered
_
not
_
to
like
him
,
she
immediately
made
up
her
mind
*NL*
that
she
would
.
Inclination
as
well
as
perversity
made
the
decision
*NL*
easy
,
and
,
being
already
much
excited
,
Meg
opposed
the
old
lady
with
*NL*
unusual
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
marry
whom
I
please
,
Aunt
March
,
and
you
can
leave
your
money
*NL*
to
any
one
you
like
,
''
she
said
,
nodding
her
head
with
a
resolute
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Highty
tighty
!
Is
that
the
way
you
take
my
advice
,
miss
?
You
'll
be
*NL*
sorry
for
it
,
by
and
by
,
when
you
've
tried
love
in
a
cottage
,
and
found
*NL*
it
a
failure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
a
worse
one
than
some
people
find
in
big
houses
,
''
retorted
*NL*
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
March
put
on
her
glasses
and
took
a
look
at
the
girl
,
for
she
did
*NL*
not
know
her
in
this
new
mood
.
Meg
hardly
knew
herself
,
she
felt
so
*NL*
brave
and
independent
,
--
so
glad
to
defend
John
,
and
assert
her
right
to
*NL*
love
him
,
if
she
liked
.
Aunt
March
saw
that
she
had
begun
wrong
,
and
,
*NL*
after
a
little
pause
,
made
a
fresh
start
,
saying
,
as
mildly
as
she
*NL*
could
,
``
Now
,
Meg
,
my
dear
,
be
reasonable
,
and
take
my
advice
.
I
mean
it
*NL*
kindly
,
and
do
n't
want
you
to
spoil
your
whole
life
by
making
a
mistake
*NL*
at
the
beginning
.
You
ought
to
marry
well
,
and
help
your
family
;
it
's
*NL*
your
duty
to
make
a
rich
match
,
and
it
ought
to
be
impressed
upon
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
and
mother
do
n't
think
so
;
they
like
John
,
though
he
_
is
_
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
parents
,
my
dear
,
have
no
more
worldly
wisdom
than
two
babies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
''
cried
Meg
stoutly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
March
took
no
notice
,
but
went
on
with
her
lecture
.
``
This
Rook
is
*NL*
poor
,
and
has
n't
got
any
rich
relations
,
has
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
he
has
many
warm
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca

live
on
friends

try
it

and
see
how
cool
they
'll
grow

He

has
n't
any
business
,
has
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
;
Mr.
Laurence
is
going
to
help
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
wo

last
long
.
James
Laurence
is
a
crotchety
old
fellow
,
and
not
*NL*
to
be
depended
on
.
So
you
intend
to
marry
a
man
without
money
,
position
,
*NL*
or
business
,
and
go
on
working
harder
than
you
do
now
,
when
you
might
be
*NL*
comfortable
all
your
days
by
minding
me

doing
better

I
thought
you
*NL*
had
more
sense
,
Meg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
do
better
if
I
waited
half
my
life

John

wise

's
got
heaps
of
talent

he
's
willing

work

sure
to

on

energetic

brave

Every

proud

to
think
he
cares
for
me

though
I
'm
so
poor
and
young
and
silly

said
*NL*
Meg
,
looking
prettier
than
ever
in
her
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
knows
_
you
_
have
got
rich
relations

child

that
's
the
secret
of
his

liking

I
suspect

*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
March

how
dare
you
say
such
a
thing

John
is
above
such
meanness

*NL*

I
wo
n't
listen
to
you
a
minute
if
you
talk
so

cried
Meg
*NL*
indignantly
,
forgetting
everything
but
the
injustice
of
the
old
lady
's
*NL*
suspicions
.
``
My
John
would
n't
marry
for
money
,
anymore
than
I
would

We
*NL*
are
willing
to
work

and
we
mean
to
wait

I
'm
not
afraid
of
being
poor
,
*NL*
for
I
've
been
happy
so
far
,
and
I
know
I
shall
be
with
him
,
because
he
*NL*
loves
me
,
and
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
stopped
there
,
remembering
all
of
a
sudden
that
she
had
n't
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
;
that
she
had
told
``
her
John
''
to
go
away
,
and
that
he
might
be
*NL*
overhearing
her
inconsistent
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
March
was
very
angry
,
for
she
had
set
her
heart
on
having
her
*NL*
pretty
niece
make
a
fine
match
,
and
something
in
the
girl
's
happy
young
*NL*
face
made
the
lonely
old
woman
feel
both
sad
and
sour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wash
my
hands
of
the
whole
affair
!
You
are
a
wilful
child
,
and
*NL*
you
've
lost
more
than
you
know
by
this
piece
of
folly
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
stop
;
*NL*
I
'm
disappointed
in
you
,
and
have
n't
spirits
to
see
your
father
now
.
*NL*
Do
n't
expect
anything
from
me
when
you
are
married
;
your
Mr.
Book
's
*NL*
friends
must
take
care
of
you

I
'm
done
with
you
forever

''
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
slamming
the
door
in
Meg
's
face
,
Aunt
March
drove
off
in
high
*NL*
dudgeon
.
She
seemed
to
take
all
the
girl
's
courage
with
her
;
for
,
when
*NL*
left
alone
,
Meg
stood
a
moment
,
undecided
whether
to
laugh
or
cry
.
*NL*
Before
she
could
make
up
her
mind
,
she
was
taken
possession
of
by
Mr.
*NL*
Brooke
,
who
said
,
all
in
one
breath
,
``
I
could
n't
help
hearing
,
Meg
.
*NL*
Thank
you
for
defending
me
,
and
Aunt
March
for
proving
that
you
_
do
_
*NL*
care
for
me
a
little
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
how
much
,
till
she
abused
you
,
''
began
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
need
n't
go
away
,
but
may
stay
and
be
happy
,
may
I
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
another
fine
chance
to
make
the
crushing
speech
and
the
stately
*NL*
exit
,
but
Meg
never
thought
of
doing
either
,
and
disgraced
herself
*NL*
forever
in
Jo
's
eyes
by
meekly
whispering
,
``
Yes
,
John
,
''
and
hiding
her
*NL*
face
on
Mr.
Brooke
's
waistcoat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fifteen
minutes
after
Aunt
March
's
departure
,
Jo
came
softly
down
*NL*
stairs
,
paused
an
instant
at
the
parlor
door
,
and
,
hearing
no
sound
*NL*
within
,
nodded
and
smiled
,
with
a
satisfied
expression
,
saying
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
She
has
sent
him
away
as
we
planned
,
and
that
affair
is
*NL*
settled
.
I
'll
go
and
hear
the
fun
,
and
have
a
good
laugh
over
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
poor
Jo
never
got
her
laugh
,
for
she
was
transfixed
upon
the
*NL*
threshold
by
a
spectacle
which
held
her
there
,
staring
with
her
mouth
*NL*
nearly
as
wide
open
as
her
eyes
.
Going
in
to
exult
over
a
fallen
enemy
,
*NL*
and
to
praise
a
strong-minded
sister
for
the
banishment
of
an
*NL*
objectionable
lover
,
it
certainly
_
was
_
a
shock
to
behold
the
aforesaid
*NL*
enemy
serenely
sitting
on
the
sofa
,
with
the
strong-minded
sister
*NL*
enthroned
upon
his
knee
,
and
wearing
an
expression
of
the
most
abject
*NL*
submission
.
Jo
gave
a
sort
of
gasp
,
as
if
a
cold
shower-bath
had
*NL*
suddenly
fallen
upon
her
,
--
for
such
an
unexpected
turning
of
the
tables
*NL*
actually
took
her
breath
away
.
At
the
odd
sound
,
the
lovers
turned
and
*NL*
saw
her
.
Meg
jumped
up
,
looking
both
proud
and
shy
;
but
``
that
man
,
''
as
*NL*
Jo
called
him
,
actually
laughed
,
and
said
coolly
,
as
he
kissed
the
*NL*
astonished
new-comer
,
``
Sister
Jo
,
congratulate
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
adding
insult
to
injury
,
--
it
was
altogether
too
much
,
--
and
,
*NL*
making
some
wild
demonstration
with
her
hands
,
Jo
vanished
without
a
*NL*
word
.
Rushing
upstairs
,
she
startled
the
invalids
by
exclaiming
*NL*
tragically
,
as
she
burst
into
the
room
,
``
Oh
,
_
do
_
somebody
go
down
*NL*
quick
;
John
Brooke
is
acting
dreadfully
,
and
Meg
likes
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
and
Mrs.
March
left
the
room
with
speed
;
and
,
casting
herself
upon
*NL*
the
bed
,
Jo
cried
and
scolded
tempestuously
as
she
told
the
awful
news
*NL*
to
Beth
and
Amy
.
The
little
girls
,
however
,
considered
it
a
most
*NL*
agreeable
and
interesting
event
,
and
Jo
got
little
comfort
from
them
;
so
*NL*
she
went
up
to
her
refuge
in
the
garret
,
and
confided
her
troubles
to
*NL*
the
rats
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
ever
knew
what
went
on
in
the
parlor
that
afternoon
;
but
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
talking
was
done
,
and
quiet
Mr.
Brooke
astonished
his
friends
by
*NL*
the
eloquence
and
spirit
with
which
he
pleaded
his
suit
,
told
his
plans
,
*NL*
and
persuaded
them
to
arrange
everything
just
as
he
wanted
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tea-bell
rang
before
he
had
finished
describing
the
paradise
which
*NL*
he
meant
to
earn
for
Meg
,
and
he
proudly
took
her
in
to
supper
,
both
*NL*
looking
so
happy
that
Jo
had
n't
the
heart
to
be
jealous
or
dismal
.
Amy
*NL*
was
very
much
impressed
by
John
's
devotion
and
Meg
's
dignity
.
Beth
*NL*
beamed
at
them
from
a
distance
,
while
Mr.
and
Mrs.
March
surveyed
the
*NL*
young
couple
with
such
tender
satisfaction
that
it
was
perfectly
evident
*NL*
Aunt
March
was
right
in
calling
them
as
``
unworldly
as
a
pair
of
babies
.
''
*NL*
No
one
ate
much
,
but
every
one
looked
very
happy
,
and
the
old
room
*NL*
seemed
to
brighten
up
amazingly
when
the
first
romance
of
the
family
*NL*
began
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
say
nothing
pleasant
ever
happens
now
,
can
you
,
Meg
?
''
said
*NL*
Amy
,
trying
to
decide
how
she
would
group
the
lovers
in
the
sketch
she
*NL*
was
planning
to
take
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
'm
sure
I
ca
n't
.
How
much
has
happened
since
I
said
that
!
It
seems
*NL*
a
year
ago
,
''
answered
Meg
,
who
was
in
a
blissful
dream
,
lifted
far
above
*NL*
such
common
things
as
bread
and
butter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
joys
come
close
upon
the
sorrows
this
time
,
and
I
rather
think
the
*NL*
changes
have
begun
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
.
``
In
most
families
there
comes
,
now
*NL*
and
then
,
a
year
full
of
events
;
this
has
been
such
an
one
,
but
it
ends
*NL*
well
,
after
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hope
the
next
will
end
better
,
''
muttered
Jo
,
who
found
it
very
hard
to
*NL*
see
Meg
absorbed
in
a
stranger
before
her
face
;
for
Jo
loved
a
few
*NL*
persons
very
dearly
,
and
dreaded
to
have
their
affection
lost
or
*NL*
lessened
in
any
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
the
third
year
from
this
_
will
_
end
better
;
I
mean
it
shall
,
if
*NL*
I
live
to
work
out
my
plans
,
''
said
Mr.
Brooke
,
smiling
at
Meg
,
as
if
*NL*
everything
had
become
possible
to
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
n't
it
seem
very
long
to
wait
?
''
asked
Amy
,
who
was
in
a
hurry
for
*NL*
the
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
so
much
to
learn
before
I
shall
be
ready
,
it
seems
a
short
*NL*
time
to
me
,
''
answered
Meg
,
with
a
sweet
gravity
in
her
face
,
never
seen
*NL*
there
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
only
to
wait
;
_
I
_
am
to
do
the
work
,
''
said
John
,
beginning
his
*NL*
labors
by
picking
up
Meg
's
napkin
,
with
an
expression
which
caused
Jo
to
*NL*
shake
her
head
,
and
then
say
to
herself
,
with
an
air
of
relief
,
as
the
*NL*
front
door
banged
,
``
Here
comes
Laurie
.
Now
we
shall
have
a
little
*NL*
sensible
conversation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jo
was
mistaken
;
for
Laurie
came
prancing
in
,
overflowing
with
*NL*
spirits
,
bearing
a
great
bridal-looking
bouquet
for
``
Mrs.
John
Brooke
,
''
*NL*
and
evidently
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
whole
affair
had
been
*NL*
brought
about
by
his
excellent
management
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Much

''
answered
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
who
felt
at
peace
with
all
mankind
even
his
mischievous
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
if
I
'm
at
the
ends

the
earth
;
for
the
sight
of
Jo
's

*NL*
alone
,
on
that
occasion

would
be
worth
a
long
journey
.
You
do
n't
look
*NL*
festive
,
ma'am
;
what
's
the
matter
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
following
her
into
a
*NL*
corner
of
the
parlor
,
whither
all
had
adjourned
to
greet
Mr.
Laurence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
approve
of
the
match
,
but
I
've
made
up
my
mind
to
bear
it
,
and
*NL*
shall
not
say
a
word
against
it
,
''
said
Jo
solemnly
.
``
You
ca
n't
know
how
*NL*
hard
it
is
for
me
to
give
up
Meg
,
''
she
continued
,
with
a
little
quiver
*NL*
in
her
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
give
her
up
.
You
only
go
halves
,
''
said
Laurie
consolingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
never
can
be
the
same
again
.
I
've
lost
my
dearest
friend
,
''
sighed
*NL*
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
got
me
,
anyhow
.
I
'm
not
good
for
much
,
I
know
;
but
I
'll
stand
*NL*
by
you
,
Jo
,
all
the
days
of
my
life
;
upon
my
word
I
will
!
''
and
Laurie
*NL*
meant
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
will
,
and
I
'm
ever
so
much
obliged
;
you
are
always
a
great
*NL*
comfort
to
me
,
Teddy
,
''
returned
Jo
,
gratefully
shaking
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
do
n't
be
dismal
,
there
's
a
good
fellow
.
It
's
all
right
,
you
*NL*
see
.
Meg
is
happy
;
Brooke
will
fly
round
and
get
settled
immediately
;
*NL*
grandpa
will
attend
to
him
,
and
it
will
be
very
jolly
to
see
Meg
in
her
*NL*
own
little
house
.
We
'll
have
capital
times
after
she
is
gone
,
for
I
*NL*
shall
be
through
college
before
long
,
and
then
we
'll
go
abroad
,
or
some
*NL*
nice
trip
or
other
.
Would
n't
that
console
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
think
it
would
;
but
there
's
no
knowing
what
may
happen
in
*NL*
three
years
,
''
said
Jo
thoughtfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
true
.
Do
n't
you
wish
you
could
take
a
look
forward
,
and
see
*NL*
where
we
shall
all
be
then
?
I
do
,
''
returned
Laurie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
not
,
for
I
might
see
something
sad
;
and
every
one
looks
so
*NL*
happy
now
,
I
do
n't
believe
they
could
be
much
improved
,
''
and
Jo
's
eyes
*NL*
went
slowly
round
the
room
,
brightening
as
they
looked
,
for
the
prospect
*NL*
was
a
pleasant
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Father
and
mother
sat
together
,
quietly
re-living
the
first
chapter
of
*NL*
the
romance
which
for
them
began
some
twenty
years
ago
.
Amy
was
drawing
*NL*
the
lovers
,
who
sat
apart
in
a
beautiful
world
of
their
own
,
the
light
*NL*
of
which
touched
their
faces
with
a
grace
the
little
artist
could
not
*NL*
copy
.
Beth
lay
on
her
sofa
,
talking
cheerily
with
her
old
friend
,
who
*NL*
held
her
little
hand
as
if
he
felt
that
it
possessed
the
power
to
lead
*NL*
him
along
the
peaceful
way
she
walked
.
Jo
lounged
in
her
favorite
low
*NL*
seat
,
with
the
grave
,
quiet
look
which
best
became
her
;
and
Laurie
,
*NL*
leaning
on
the
back
of
her
chair
,
his
chin
on
a
level
with
her
curly
*NL*
head
,
smiled
with
his
friendliest
aspect
,
and
nodded
at
her
in
the
long
*NL*
glass
which
reflected
them
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
So
grouped
,
the
curtain
falls
upon
Meg
,
Jo
,
Beth
,
and
Amy
.
Whether
it
*NL*
ever
rises
again
,
depends
upon
the
reception
given
to
the
first
act
of
*NL*
the
domestic
drama
called
``
LITTLE
WOMEN

In
order
that
we
may
start
afresh
,
and
go
to
Meg
's
wedding
with
free
*NL*
minds
,
it
will
be
well
to
begin
with
a
little
gossip
about
the
Marches
.
*NL*
And
here
let
me
premise
,
that
if
any
of
the
elders
think
there
is
too
*NL*
much
``
lovering
''
in
the
story
,
as
I
fear
they
may
-LRB-
I
'm
not
afraid
the
*NL*
young
folks
will
make
that
objection
-RRB-
,
I
can
only
say
with
Mrs.
March
,
*NL*
``
What
_
can
_
you
expect
when
I
have
four
gay
girls
in
the
house
,
and
a
*NL*
dashing
young
neighbor
over
the
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
years
that
have
passed
have
brought
but
few
changes
to
the
*NL*
quiet
family
.
The
war
is
over
,
and
Mr.
March
safely
at
home
,
busy
with
*NL*
his
books
and
the
small
parish
which
found
in
him
a
minister
by
nature
*NL*
as
by
grace
,
--
a
quiet
,
studious
man
,
rich
in
the
wisdom
that
is
better
*NL*
than
learning
,
the
charity
which
calls
all
mankind
``
brother
,
''
the
piety
*NL*
that
blossoms
into
character
,
making
it
august
and
lovely
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
attributes
,
in
spite
of
poverty
and
the
strict
integrity
which
*NL*
shut
him
out
from
the
more
worldly
successes
,
attracted
to
him
many
*NL*
admirable
persons
,
as
naturally
as
sweet
herbs
draw
bees
,
and
as
*NL*
naturally
he
gave
them
the
honey
into
which
fifty
years
of
hard
*NL*
experience
had
distilled
no
bitter
drop
.
Earnest
young
men
found
the
*NL*
grayheaded
scholar
as
young
at
heart
as
they
;
thoughtful
or
troubled
*NL*
women
instinctively
brought
their
doubts
and
sorrows
to
him
,
sure
of
*NL*
finding
the
gentlest
sympathy
,
the
wisest
counsel
;
sinners
told
their
*NL*
sins
to
the
pure-hearted
old
man
,
and
were
both
rebuked
and
saved
;
*NL*
gifted
men
found
a
companion
in
him
;
ambitious
men
caught
glimpses
of
*NL*
nobler
ambitions
than
their
own
;
and
even
worldlings
confessed
that
his
*NL*
beliefs
were
beautiful
and
true
,
although
``
they
would
n't
pay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
outsiders
,
the
five
energetic
women
seemed
to
rule
the
house
,
and
so
*NL*
they
did
in
many
things
;
but
the
quiet
scholar
,
sitting
among
his
books
,
*NL*
was
still
the
head
of
the
family
,
the
household
conscience
,
anchor
,
and
*NL*
comforter
;
for
to
him
the
busy
,
anxious
women
always
turned
in
troublous
*NL*
times
,
finding
him
,
in
the
truest
sense
of
those
sacred
words
,
husband
*NL*
and
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girls
gave
their
hearts
into
their
mother
's
keeping
,
their
souls
*NL*
into
their
father
's
;
and
to
both
parents
,
who
lived
and
labored
so
*NL*
faithfully
for
them
,
they
gave
a
love
that
grew
with
their
growth
,
and
*NL*
bound
them
tenderly
together
by
the
sweetest
tie
which
blesses
life
and
*NL*
outlives
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
is
as
brisk
and
cheery
,
though
rather
grayer
,
than
when
we
*NL*
saw
her
last
,
and
just
now
so
absorbed
in
Meg
's
affairs
that
the
*NL*
hospitals
and
homes
,
still
full
of
wounded
``
boys
''
and
soldiers
'
widows
,
*NL*
decidedly
miss
the
motherly
missionary
's
visits
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
Brooke
did
his
duty
manfully
for
a
year
,
got
wounded
,
was
sent
*NL*
home
,
and
not
allowed
to
return
.
He
received
no
stars
or
bars
,
but
he
*NL*
deserved
them
,
for
he
cheerfully
risked
all
he
had
;
and
life
and
love
*NL*
are
very
precious
when
both
are
in
full
bloom
.
Perfectly
resigned
to
his
*NL*
discharge
,
he
devoted
himself
to
getting
well
,
preparing
for
business
,
*NL*
and
earning
a
home
for
Meg
.
With
the
good
sense
and
sturdy
independence
*NL*
that
characterized
him
,
he
refused
Mr.
Laurence
's
more
generous
offers
,
*NL*
and
accepted
the
place
of
book-keeper
feeling
better
satisfied
to
begin
*NL*
with
an
honestly-earned
salary
than
by
running
any
risks
with
borrowed
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
had
spent
the
time
in
working
as
well
as
waiting
,
growing
womanly
in
*NL*
character
,
wise
in
housewifely
arts
,
and
prettier
than
ever
;
for
love
is
*NL*
a
great
beautifier
.
She
had
her
girlish
ambitions
and
hopes
,
and
felt
*NL*
some
disappointment
at
the
humble
way
in
which
the
new
life
must
begin
.
*NL*
Ned
Moffat
had
just
married
Sallie
Gardiner
,
and
Meg
could
n't
help
*NL*
contrasting
their
fine
house
and
carriage
,
many
gifts
,
and
splendid
*NL*
outfit
,
with
her
own
,
and
secretly
wishing
she
could
have
the
same
.
But
*NL*
somehow
envy
and
discontent
soon
vanished
when
she
thought
of
all
the
*NL*
patient
love
and
labor
John
had
put
into
the
little
home
awaiting
her
;
*NL*
and
when
they
sat
together
in
the
twilight
,
talking
over
their
small
*NL*
plans
,
the
future
always
grew
so
beautiful
and
bright
that
she
forgot
*NL*
Sallie
's
splendor
,
and
felt
herself
the
richest
,
happiest
girl
in
*NL*
Christendom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
never
went
back
to
Aunt
March
,
for
the
old
lady
took
such
a
fancy
to
*NL*
Amy
that
she
bribed
her
with
the
offer
of
drawing
lessons
from
one
of
*NL*
the
best
teachers
going
;
and
for
the
sake
of
this
advantage
,
Amy
would
*NL*
have
served
a
far
harder
mistress
.
So
she
gave
her
mornings
to
duty
,
her
*NL*
afternoons
to
pleasure
,
and
prospered
finely
.
Jo
,
meantime
,
devoted
*NL*
herself
to
literature
and
Beth
,
who
remained
delicate
long
after
the
*NL*
fever
was
a
thing
of
the
past
.
Not
an
invalid
exactly
,
but
never
again
*NL*
the
rosy
,
healthy
creature
she
had
been
;
yet
always
hopeful
,
happy
,
and
*NL*
serene
,
busy
with
the
quiet
duties
she
loved
,
every
one
's
friend
,
and
an
*NL*
angel
in
the
house
,
long
before
those
who
loved
her
most
had
learned
to
*NL*
know
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
long
as
``
The
Spread
Eagle
''
paid
her
a
dollar
a
column
for
her
*NL*
``
rubbish
,
''
as
she
called
it
,
Jo
felt
herself
a
woman
of
means
,
and
spun
*NL*
her
little
romances
diligently
.
But
great
plans
fermented
in
her
busy
*NL*
brain
and
ambitious
mind
,
and
the
old
tin
kitchen
in
the
garret
held
a
*NL*
slowly
increasing
pile
of
blotted
manuscript
,
which
was
one
day
to
place
*NL*
the
name
of
March
upon
the
roll
of
fame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
,
having
dutifully
gone
to
college
to
please
his
grandfather
,
was
*NL*
now
getting
through
it
in
the
easiest
possible
manner
to
please
*NL*
himself
.
A
universal
favorite
,
thanks
to
money
,
manners
,
much
talent
,
*NL*
and
the
kindest
heart
that
ever
got
its
owner
into
scrapes
by
trying
to
*NL*
get
other
people
out
of
them
,
he
stood
in
great
danger
of
being
spoilt
,
*NL*
and
probably
would
have
been
,
like
many
another
promising
boy
,
if
he
had
*NL*
not
possessed
a
talisman
against
evil
in
the
memory
of
the
kind
old
man
*NL*
who
was
bound
up
in
his
success
,
the
motherly
friend
who
watched
over
*NL*
him
as
if
he
were
her
son
,
and
last
,
but
not
least
by
any
means
,
the
*NL*
knowledge
that
four
innocent
girls
loved
,
admired
,
and
believed
in
him
*NL*
with
all
their
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
only
``
a
glorious
human
boy
,
''
of
course
he
frolicked
and
flirted
,
*NL*
grew
dandified
,
aquatic
,
sentimental
,
or
gymnastic
,
as
college
fashions
*NL*
ordained
;
hazed
and
was
hazed
,
talked
slang
,
and
more
than
once
came
*NL*
perilously
near
suspension
and
expulsion
.
But
as
high
spirits
and
the
*NL*
love
of
fun
were
the
causes
of
these
pranks
,
he
always
managed
to
save
*NL*
himself
by
frank
confession
,
honorable
atonement
,
or
the
irresistible
*NL*
power
of
persuasion
which
he
possessed
in
perfection
.
In
fact
,
he
rather
*NL*
prided
himself
on
his
narrow
escapes
,
and
liked
to
thrill
the
girls
with
*NL*
graphic
accounts
of
his
triumphs
over
wrathful
tutors
,
dignified
*NL*
professors
,
and
vanquished
enemies
.
The
``
men
of
my
class
''
were
heroes
in
*NL*
the
eyes
of
the
girls
,
who
never
wearied
of
the
exploits
of
``
our
*NL*
fellows
,
''
and
were
frequently
allowed
to
bask
in
the
smiles
of
these
*NL*
great
creatures
,
when
Laurie
brought
them
home
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
especially
enjoyed
this
high
honor
,
and
became
quite
a
belle
among
*NL*
them
;
for
her
ladyship
early
felt
and
learned
to
use
the
gift
of
*NL*
fascination
with
which
she
was
endowed
.
Meg
was
too
much
absorbed
in
her
*NL*
private
and
particular
John
to
care
for
any
other
lords
of
creation
,
and
*NL*
Beth
too
shy
to
do
more
than
peep
at
them
,
and
wonder
how
Amy
dared
to
*NL*
order
them
about
so
;
but
Jo
felt
quite
in
her
element
,
and
found
it
very
*NL*
difficult
to
refrain
from
imitating
the
gentlemanly
attitudes
,
phrases
,
*NL*
and
feats
,
which
seemed
more
natural
to
her
than
the
decorums
prescribed
*NL*
for
young
ladies
.
They
all
liked
Jo
immensely
,
but
never
fell
in
love
*NL*
with
her
,
though
very
few
escaped
without
paying
the
tribute
of
a
*NL*
sentimental
sigh
or
two
at
Amy
's
shrine
.
And
speaking
of
sentiment
*NL*
brings
us
very
naturally
to
the
``
Dove-cote
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
the
name
of
the
little
brown
house
which
Mr.
Brooke
had
*NL*
prepared
for
Meg
's
first
home
.
Laurie
had
christened
it
,
saying
it
was
*NL*
highly
appropriate
to
the
gentle
lovers
,
who
``
went
on
together
like
a
*NL*
pair
of
turtle-doves
,
with
first
a
bill
and
then
a
coo
.
''
It
was
a
tiny
*NL*
house
,
with
a
little
garden
behind
,
and
a
lawn
about
as
big
as
a
*NL*
pocket-handkerchief
in
front
.
Here
Meg
meant
to
have
a
fountain
,
*NL*
shrubbery
,
and
a
profusion
of
lovely
flowers
;
though
just
at
present
,
*NL*
the
fountain
was
represented
by
a
weather-beaten
urn
,
very
like
a
*NL*
dilapidated
slop-bowl
;
the
shrubbery
consisted
of
several
young
larches
,
*NL*
undecided
whether
to
live
or
die
;
and
the
profusion
of
flowers
was
*NL*
merely
hinted
by
regiments
of
sticks
,
to
show
where
seeds
were
planted
.
*NL*
But
inside
,
it
was
altogether
charming
,
and
the
happy
bride
saw
no
fault
*NL*
from
garret
to
cellar
.
To
be
sure
,
the
hall
was
so
narrow
,
it
was
*NL*
fortunate
that
they
had
no
piano
,
for
one
never
could
have
been
got
in
*NL*
whole
;
the
dining-room
was
so
small
that
six
people
were
a
tight
fit
;
*NL*
and
the
kitchen
stairs
seemed
built
for
the
express
purpose
of
*NL*
precipitating
both
servants
and
china
pell-mell
into
the
coal-bin
.
But
*NL*
once
get
used
to
these
slight
blemishes
,
and
nothing
could
be
more
*NL*
complete
,
for
good
sense
and
good
taste
had
presided
over
the
*NL*
furnishing
,
and
the
result
was
highly
satisfactory
.
There
were
no
*NL*
marble-topped
tables
,
long
mirrors
,
or
lace
curtains
in
the
little
*NL*
parlor
,
but
simple
furniture
,
plenty
of
books
,
a
fine
picture
or
two
,
a
*NL*
stand
of
flowers
in
the
bay-window
,
and
,
scattered
all
about
,
the
pretty
*NL*
gifts
which
came
from
friendly
hands
,
and
were
the
fairer
for
the
loving
*NL*
messages
they
brought
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
the
Parian
Psyche
Laurie
gave
lost
any
of
its
beauty
*NL*
because
John
put
up
the
bracket
it
stood
upon
;
that
any
upholsterer
*NL*
could
have
draped
the
plain
muslin
curtains
more
gracefully
than
Amy
's
*NL*
artistic
hand
;
or
that
any
store-room
was
ever
better
provided
with
good
*NL*
wishes
,
merry
words
,
and
happy
hopes
,
than
that
in
which
Jo
and
her
*NL*
mother
put
away
Meg
's
few
boxes
,
barrels
,
and
bundles
;
and
I
am
morally
*NL*
certain
that
the
spandy-new
kitchen
never
_
could
_
have
looked
so
cosey
*NL*
and
neat
if
Hannah
had
not
arranged
every
pot
and
pan
a
dozen
times
*NL*
over
,
and
laid
the
fire
all
ready
for
lighting
,
the
minute
``
Mis
.
Brooke
*NL*
came
home
.
''
I
also
doubt
if
any
young
matron
ever
began
life
with
so
*NL*
rich
a
supply
of
dusters
,
holders
,
and
piece-bags
;
for
Beth
made
enough
*NL*
to
last
till
the
silver
wedding
came
round
,
and
invented
three
*NL*
different
kinds
of
dishcloths
for
the
express
service
of
the
bridal
*NL*
china
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
who
hire
all
these
things
done
for
them
never
know
what
they
*NL*
lose
;
for
the
homeliest
tasks
get
beautified
if
loving
hands
do
them
,
*NL*
and
Meg
found
so
many
proofs
of
this
,
that
everything
in
her
small
nest
,
*NL*
from
the
kitchen
roller
to
the
silver
vase
on
her
parlor
table
,
was
*NL*
eloquent
of
home
love
and
tender
forethought
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
happy
times
they
had
planning
together
,
what
solemn
shopping
*NL*
excursions
;
what
funny
mistakes
they
made
,
and
what
shouts
of
laughter
*NL*
arose
over
Laurie
's
ridiculous
bargains
.
In
his
love
of
jokes
,
this
*NL*
young
gentleman
,
though
nearly
through
college
,
was
as
much
of
a
boy
as
*NL*
ever
.
His
last
whim
had
been
to
bring
with
him
,
on
his
weekly
visits
,
*NL*
some
new
,
useful
,
and
ingenious
article
for
the
young
housekeeper
.
Now
a
*NL*
bag
of
remarkable
clothes-pins
;
next
,
a
wonderful
nutmeg-grater
,
which
*NL*
fell
to
pieces
at
the
first
trial
;
a
knife-cleaner
that
spoilt
all
the
*NL*
knives
;
or
a
sweeper
that
picked
the
nap
neatly
off
the
carpet
,
and
left
*NL*
the
dirt
;
labor-saving
soap
that
took
the
skin
off
one
's
hands
;
*NL*
infallible
cements
which
stuck
firmly
to
nothing
but
the
fingers
of
the
*NL*
deluded
buyer
;
and
every
kind
of
tin-ware
,
from
a
toy
savings-bank
for
*NL*
odd
pennies
,
to
a
wonderful
boiler
which
would
wash
articles
in
its
own
*NL*
steam
,
with
every
prospect
of
exploding
in
the
process
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
vain
Meg
begged
him
to
stop
.
John
laughed
at
him
,
and
Jo
called
him
*NL*
``
Mr.
Toodles
.
''
He
was
possessed
with
a
mania
for
patronizing
Yankee
*NL*
ingenuity
,
and
seeing
his
friends
fitly
furnished
forth
.
So
each
week
*NL*
beheld
some
fresh
absurdity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
done
at
last
,
even
to
Amy
's
arranging
different
colored
*NL*
soaps
to
match
the
different
colored
rooms
,
and
Beth
's
setting
the
table
*NL*
for
the
first
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
satisfied
?
Does
it
seem
like
home
,
and
do
you
feel
as
if
you
*NL*
should
be
happy
here
?
''
asked
Mrs.
March
,
as
she
and
her
daughter
went
*NL*
through
the
new
kingdom
,
arm-in-arm
;
for
just
then
they
seemed
to
cling
*NL*
together
more
tenderly
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mother
,
perfectly
satisfied
,
thanks
to
you
all
,
and
_
so
_
happy
*NL*
that
I
ca
n't
talk
about
it
,
''
answered
Meg
,
with
a
look
that
was
better
*NL*
than
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
only
had
a
servant
or
two
it
would
be
all
right
,
''
said
Amy
,
*NL*
coming
out
of
the
parlor
,
where
she
had
been
trying
to
decide
whether
*NL*
the
bronze
Mercury
looked
best
on
the
whatnot
or
the
mantle-piece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mother
and
I
have
talked
that
over
,
and
I
have
made
up
my
mind
to
try
*NL*
her
way
first
.
There
will
be
so
little
to
do
,
that
,
with
Lotty
to
run
my
*NL*
errands
and
help
me
here
and
there
,
I
shall
only
have
enough
work
to
*NL*
keep
me
from
getting
lazy
or
homesick
,
''
answered
Meg
tranquilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sallie
Moffat
has
four
,
''
began
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Meg
had
four
the
house
would
n't
hold
them
,
and
master
and
missis
*NL*
would
have
to
camp
in
the
garden
,
''
broke
in
Jo
,
who
,
enveloped
in
a
big
*NL*
blue
pinafore
,
was
giving
the
last
polish
to
the
doorhandles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sallie
is
n't
a
poor
man
's
wife
,
and
many
maids
are
in
keeping
with
her
*NL*
fine
establishment
.
Meg
and
John
begin
humbly
,
but
I
have
a
feeling
that
*NL*
there
will
be
quite
as
much
happiness
in
the
little
house
as
in
the
big
*NL*
one
.
It
's
a
great
mistake
for
young
girls
like
Meg
to
leave
themselves
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
dress
,
give
orders
,
and
gossip
.
When
I
was
first
*NL*
married
,
I
used
to
long
for
my
new
clothes
to
wear
out
or
get
torn
,
so
*NL*
that
I
might
have
the
pleasure
of
mending
them
;
for
I
got
heartily
sick
*NL*
of
doing
fancy
work
and
tending
my
pocket
handkerchief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
go
into
the
kitchen
and
make
messes
,
as
Sallie
says
she
*NL*
does
,
to
amuse
herself
,
though
they
never
turn
out
well
,
and
the
*NL*
servants
laugh
at
her
,
''
said
Meg
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
after
a
while
;
not
to
`
mess
,
'
but
to
learn
of
Hannah
how
things
*NL*
should
be
done
,
that
my
servants
need
_
not
_
laugh
at
me
.
It
was
play
*NL*
then
;
but
there
came
a
time
when
I
was
truly
grateful
that
I
not
only
*NL*
possessed
the
will
but
the
power
to
cook
wholesome
food
for
my
little
*NL*
girls
,
and
help
myself
when
I
could
no
longer
afford
to
hire
help
.
You
*NL*
begin
at
the
other
end
,
Meg
,
dear
;
but
the
lessons
you
learn
now
will
be
*NL*
of
use
to
you
by
and
by
,
when
John
is
a
richer
man
,
for
the
mistress
of
*NL*
a
house
,
however
splendid
,
should
know
how
work
ought
to
be
done
,
if
she
*NL*
wishes
to
be
well
and
honestly
served
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mother
,
I
'm
sure
of
that
,
''
said
Meg
,
listening
respectfully
to
the
*NL*
little
lecture
;
for
the
best
of
women
will
hold
forth
upon
the
*NL*
all-absorbing
subject
of
housekeeping
.
``
Do
you
know
I
like
this
room
*NL*
most
of
all
in
my
baby-house
,
''
added
Meg
,
a
minute
after
,
as
they
went
*NL*
upstairs
,
and
she
looked
into
her
well-stored
linen-closet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
was
there
,
laying
the
snowy
piles
smoothly
on
the
shelves
,
and
*NL*
exulting
over
the
goodly
array
.
All
three
laughed
as
Meg
spoke
;
for
that
*NL*
linen-closet
was
a
joke
.
You
see
,
having
said
that
if
Meg
married
``
that
*NL*
Brooke
''
she
should
n't
have
a
cent
of
her
money
,
Aunt
March
was
rather
in
*NL*
a
quandary
,
when
time
had
appeased
her
wrath
and
made
her
repent
her
*NL*
vow
.
She
never
broke
her
word
,
and
was
much
exercised
in
her
mind
how
to
*NL*
get
round
it
,
and
at
last
devised
a
plan
whereby
she
could
satisfy
*NL*
herself
.
Mrs.
Carrol
,
Florence
's
mamma
,
was
ordered
to
buy
,
have
made
,
*NL*
and
marked
,
a
generous
supply
of
house
and
table
linen
,
and
send
it
as
*NL*
_
her
_
present
,
all
of
which
was
faithfully
done
;
but
the
secret
leaked
*NL*
out
,
and
was
greatly
enjoyed
by
the
family
;
for
Aunt
March
tried
to
look
*NL*
utterly
unconscious
,
and
insisted
that
she
could
give
nothing
but
the
*NL*
old-fashioned
pearls
,
long
promised
to
the
first
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
housewifely
taste
which
I
am
glad
to
see
.
I
had
a
young
friend
*NL*
who
set
up
housekeeping
with
six
sheets
,
but
she
had
finger
bowls
for
*NL*
company
,
and
that
satisfied
her
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
patting
the
damask
*NL*
table-cloths
,
with
a
truly
feminine
appreciation
of
their
fineness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
a
single
finger-bowl
,
but
this
is
a
`
set
out
'
that
will
last
*NL*
me
all
my
days
,
Hannah
says
;
''
and
Meg
looked
quite
contented
,
as
well
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Toodles
is
coming
,
''
cried
Jo
from
below
;
and
they
all
went
down
to
meet
*NL*
Laurie
,
whose
weekly
visit
was
an
important
event
in
their
quiet
lives
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
,
broad-shouldered
young
fellow
,
with
a
cropped
head
,
a
felt-basin
*NL*
of
a
hat
,
and
a
fly-away
coat
,
came
tramping
down
the
road
at
a
great
*NL*
pace
,
walked
over
the
low
fence
without
stopping
to
open
the
gate
,
*NL*
straight
up
to
Mrs.
March
,
with
both
hands
out
,
and
a
hearty
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
I
am
,
mother
!
Yes
,
it
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
were
in
answer
to
the
look
the
elder
lady
gave
him
;
a
*NL*
kindly
questioning
look
,
which
the
handsome
eyes
met
so
frankly
that
the
*NL*
little
ceremony
closed
,
as
usual
,
with
a
motherly
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Mrs.
John
Brooke
,
with
the
maker
's
congratulations
and
compliments
.
*NL*
Bless
you
,
Beth
!
What
a
refreshing
spectacle
you
are
,
Jo
.
Amy
,
you
are
*NL*
getting
altogether
too
handsome
for
a
single
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Laurie
spoke
,
he
delivered
a
brown
paper
parcel
to
Meg
,
pulled
Beth
's
*NL*
hair-ribbon
,
stared
at
Jo
's
big
pinafore
,
and
fell
into
an
attitude
of
*NL*
mock
rapture
before
Amy
,
then
shook
hands
all
round
,
and
every
one
began
*NL*
to
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
John
?
''
asked
Meg
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stopped
to
get
the
license
for
to-morrow
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
side
won
the
last
match
,
Teddy
?
''
inquired
Jo
,
who
persisted
in
*NL*
feeling
an
interest
in
manly
sports
,
despite
her
nineteen
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ours
,
of
course
.
Wish
you
'd
been
there
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
lovely
Miss
Randal
?
''
asked
Amy
,
with
a
significant
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
cruel
than
ever
;
do
n't
you
see
how
I
'm
pining
away
?
''
and
Laurie
*NL*
gave
his
broad
chest
a
sounding
slap
and
heaved
a
melodramatic
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
last
joke
?
Undo
the
bundle
and
see
,
Meg
,
''
said
Beth
,
eying
*NL*
the
knobby
parcel
with
curiosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
useful
thing
to
have
in
the
house
in
case
of
fire
or
thieves
,
''
*NL*
observed
Laurie
,
as
a
watchman
's
rattle
appeared
,
amid
the
laughter
of
*NL*
the
girls
.

Mrs.

just
*NL*
swing
that
out
of
the
front
window
,
and
it
will
rouse
the
neighborhood
*NL*
in
a
jiffy
.
Nice
thing
,
is

it

''
and
Laurie
gave
them
a
sample
of
its
*NL*
powers
that
made
them
cover
up
their
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
gratitude
for
you
!
and
speaking
of
gratitude
reminds
me
to

mention
that
you
may
thank
Hannah
for
saving
your
wedding-cake
from
*NL*
destruction
.
I
saw
it
going
into
your
house
as
I
came
by
,
and
if
she
*NL*
had
n't
defended
it
manfully
I
'd
have
had
a
pick
at
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder

you
will
ever
grow
up

said
Meg
,
in
a
matronly
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

doing

responded
the
*NL*
young
gentleman
,
whose
head
was
about
level
with
the
little
chandelier
.
*NL*
``
I
suppose
it

added
presently
.

*NL*
``

away

added
Amy
,
tying
a
picturesque
hat
over
her
picturesque
*NL*
curls
,
and
enjoying
the
effect
as
much
as
anybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

in

off
your

it

said
Laurie
,
as
Jo
bestowed
his
especial
*NL*
aversion
in
her
capacious
pocket
,
and
offered
him
her
arm
to
support
his
*NL*
feeble
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Teddy

I
want
to
talk
seriously
to

about
to-morrow

began
Jo
,
*NL*
as
they
strolled
away
together
.

You

Not

*NL*

And
I
implore
you
not

certainly
laugh

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

obscure
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
cry
unless

*NL*
*NL*
``
Such

cut
in
Laurie
,
with
a
*NL*
suggestive
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

``
Exactly

it

asked
Jo
rather
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

Jo
,

look

say

All

right

if
it
was

and
Laurie
stopped
short
,
with
an
injured
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
do
n't
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
do

be
suspicious

want
some
money

said
Laurie
,
*NL*
walking
on
again
,
appeased
by
her
hearty
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spend
a
great
deal

Teddy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
you

I

do

before

it

*NL*
*NL*

kind-hearted

you
let
people
borrow

*NL*
ca
n't
say
`
No

to
any
one

We
heard
about
Henshaw
,
and
all
you
did
for
*NL*
him
.
If
you
always
spent
money
in
that
way
,
no
one
would
blame
you
,

*NL*
said
Jo
warmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
he
made
a
mountain
out
of
a
mole-hill

You
would

have
me
let
*NL*
that
fine
fellow
work
himself
to
death
,
just
for
the
want
of
a
little
*NL*
help
,
when
he
is
worth
a
dozen

lazy
chaps

you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not

I
do

the
use

your

seventeen
*NL*
waistcoats

endless
neckties
,
and
a
new
hat
every
time
you
come
home
.
I
*NL*
thought
you
'd
got
over
the
dandy
period
;
but
every
now
and
then
it
*NL*
breaks
out
in
a
new
spot
.
Just
now
it
's
the
fashion
to
be
hideous
,
--
to
*NL*
make
your
head
look
like
a
scrubbing-brush
,
wear
a
strait-jacket
,
*NL*
orange
gloves
,
and
clumping
,
square-toed
boots
.
If
it
was
cheap
*NL*
ugliness
,
I
'd
say
nothing
;
but
it
costs
as
much
as
the
other
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
get
any
satisfaction
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
threw
back
his
head
,
and
laughed
so
heartily
at
this
attack
,
that
*NL*
the
felt-basin
fell
off
,
and
Jo
walked
on
it
,
which
insult
only
afforded
*NL*
him
an
opportunity
for
expatiating
on
the
advantages
of
a
*NL*
rough-and-ready
costume
,
as
he
folded
up
the
maltreated
hat
,
and
stuffed
*NL*
it
into
his
pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
lecture
any
more
,
there
's
a
good
soul
!
I
have
enough
all
through
*NL*
the
week
,

like
to
enjoy
myself
when
I
come
home

I
'll
get
myself
up
*NL*
regardless
of
expense

to-morrow

be
a
satisfaction
to

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
leave
you

let
your

grow

I

not
*NL*
aristocratic
,

I
do
object
to
being
seen
with
a
person
who
looks
like
*NL*
a
young
prize-fighter

observed
Jo
severely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
unassuming
style
promotes
study
;
that
's
why
we
adopt
it

returned
*NL*
Laurie
,
who
certainly
could
not
be
accused
of
vanity
,
having
voluntarily
*NL*
sacrificed
a
handsome
curly
crop
to
the
demand
for
*NL*
quarter-of-an-inch-long
stubble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Jo
,
I
think
that
little
Parker
is
really
getting
desperate
*NL*
about
Amy
.
He
talks
of
her
constantly
,
writes
poetry
,
and
moons
about
in
*NL*
a
most
suspicious
manner

He
'd
better
nip
his
little
passion
in
the
bud

added
Laurie
,
in
a
confidential
,
elder-brotherly
tone
,
after
*NL*
a
minute
's
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
he
had

we
do
n't
want

Mercy
on
us

what

the
children
thinking
of

and
Jo
*NL*
looked
as
much
scandalized
as
if
Amy
and
little
Parker
were
not
yet
in
*NL*
their
teens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
fast
age

I
do

know
what

are
coming
to

are
*NL*
a
mere
infant
,
but
you
'll
go
next

we
'll
be
left
lamenting

*NL*
said
Laurie
,
shaking
his
head
over
the
degeneracy
of
the
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
alarmed

I

not
one

Nobody
will
want

it
's
a
mercy

there

always
be
one
old
maid
in
a
*NL*
family

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
give
any
one
a
chance

said
Laurie
,
with
a
sidelong
glance
,
*NL*
and
a
little
more
color
than
before
in
his
sunburnt
face
.
``
You
wo
n't
*NL*
show
the
soft
side

your
character

fellow
gets
a
peep
at
it
*NL*
by
accident
,
and
ca
n't
help
showing
that
he
likes
it
,
you
treat
him
as
*NL*
Mrs.
Gummidge
did
her
sweetheart
,
--
throw
cold
water
over
him
,
--
and
get
*NL*
so
thorny

one
dares
touch
or
look
at
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like

think
it

dreadful
to
break
up
families
so

Now
do
n't
*NL*
say
any
more
about
it

Meg

has
turned
all

nothing

lovers

cross

change
the
subject

and
Jo
looked
quite
ready
to
fling
*NL*
cold
water
on
the
slightest
provocation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
his
feelings
might
have
been
,
Laurie
found
a
vent
for
them
in
a
*NL*
long
low
whistle
,
and
the
fearful
prediction
,
as
they
parted
at
the
*NL*
gate
,
``

THE
FIRST
WEDDING
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
June
roses
over
the
porch
were
awake
bright
and
early
on
that
*NL*
morning
,
rejoicing
with
all
their
hearts
in
the
cloudless
sunshine
,
like
*NL*
friendly
little
neighbors
,
as
they
were
.
Quite
flushed
with
excitement
*NL*
were
their
ruddy
faces
,
as
they
swung
in
the
wind
,
whispering
to
one
*NL*
another
what
they
had
seen
;
for
some
peeped
in
at
the
dining-room
*NL*
windows
,
where
the
feast
was
spread
,
some
climbed
up
to
nod
and
smile
at
*NL*
the
sisters
as
they
dressed
the
bride
,
others
waved
a
welcome
to
those
*NL*
who
came
and
went
on
various
errands
in
garden
,
porch
,
and
hall
,
and
*NL*
all
,
from
the
rosiest
full-blown
flower
to
the
palest
baby-bud
,
offered
*NL*
their
tribute
of
beauty
and
fragrance
to
the
gentle
mistress
who
had
*NL*
loved
and
tended
them
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
looked
very
like
a
rose
herself
;
for
all
that
was
best
and
sweetest
*NL*
in
heart
and
soul
seemed
to
bloom
into
her
face
that
day
,
making
it
fair
*NL*
and
tender
,
with
a
charm
more
beautiful
than
beauty
.
Neither
silk
,
lace
,
*NL*
nor
orange-flowers
would
she
have
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
look
strange
or
*NL*
fixed
up
to-day
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
do
n't
want
a
fashionable
wedding
,
but
*NL*
only
those
about
me
whom
I
love
,
and
to
them
I
wish
to
look
and
be
my
*NL*
familiar
self

''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
made
her
wedding
gown
herself
,
sewing
into
it
the
tender
hopes
*NL*
and
innocent
romances
of
a
girlish
heart
.
Her
sisters
braided
up
her
*NL*
pretty
hair
,
and
the
only
ornaments
she
wore
were
the
lilies
of
the
*NL*
valley
,
which
``
her
John
''
liked
best
of
all
the
flowers
that
grew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
_
do
_
look
just
like
our
own
dear
Meg
,
only
so
very
sweet
and
lovely
*NL*
that
I
should
hug
you
if
it
would
n't
crumple
your
dress
,
''
cried
Amy
,
*NL*
surveying
her
with
delight
,
when
all
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
am
satisfied
.
But
please
hug
and
kiss
me
,
every
one
,
and
do
n't
*NL*
mind
my
dress
;
I
want
a
great
many
crumples
of
this
sort
put
into
it
*NL*
to-day
;
''
and
Meg
opened
her
arms
to
her
sisters
,
who
clung
about
her
*NL*
with
April
faces
for
a
minute
,
feeling
that
the
new
love
had
not
changed
*NL*
the
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'm
going
to
tie
John
's
cravat
for
him
,
and
then
to
stay
a
few
*NL*
minutes
with
father
quietly
in
the
study
;
''
and
Meg
ran
down
to
perform
*NL*
these
little
ceremonies
,
and
then
to
follow
her
mother
wherever
she
*NL*
went
,
conscious
that
,
in
spite
of
the
smiles
on
the
motherly
face
,
there
*NL*
was
a
secret
sorrow
hid
in
the
motherly
heart
at
the
flight
of
the
first
*NL*
bird
from
the
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
younger
girls
stand
together
,
giving
the
last
touches
to
their
*NL*
simple
toilet
,
it
may
be
a
good
time
to
tell
of
a
few
changes
which
*NL*
three
years
have
wrought
in
their
appearance
;
for
all
are
looking
their
*NL*
best
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
angles
are
much
softened
;
she
has
learned
to
carry
herself
with
*NL*
ease
,
if
not
grace
.
The
curly
crop
has
lengthened
into
a
thick
coil
,
*NL*
more
becoming
to
the
small
head
atop
of
the
tall
figure
.
There
is
a
*NL*
fresh
color
in
her
brown
cheeks
,
a
soft
shine
in
her
eyes
,
and
only
*NL*
gentle
words
fall
from
her
sharp
tongue
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
has
grown
slender
,
pale
,
and
more
quiet
than
ever
;
the
beautiful
,
*NL*
kind
eyes
are
larger
,
and
in
them
lies
an
expression
that
saddens
one
,
*NL*
although
it
is
not
sad
itself
.
It
is
the
shadow
of
pain
which
touches
*NL*
the
young
face
with
such
pathetic
patience
;
but
Beth
seldom
complains
,
*NL*
and
always
speaks
hopefully
of
``
being
better
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
is
with
truth
considered
``
the
flower
of
the
family
;
''
for
at
sixteen
*NL*
she
has
the
air
and
bearing
of
a
full-grown
woman
--
not
beautiful
,
but
*NL*
possessed
of
that
indescribable
charm
called
grace
.
One
saw
it
in
the
*NL*
lines
of
her
figure
,
the
make
and
motion
of
her
hands
,
the
flow
of
her
*NL*
dress
,
the
droop
of
her
hair
,
--
unconscious
,
yet
harmonious
,
and
as
*NL*
attractive
to
many
as
beauty
itself
.
Amy
's
nose
still
afflicted
her
,
for
*NL*
it
never
_
would
_
grow
Grecian
;
so
did
her
mouth
,
being
too
wide
,
and
*NL*
having
a
decided
chin
.
These
offending
features
gave
character
to
her
*NL*
whole
face
,
but
she
never
could
see
it
,
and
consoled
herself
with
her
*NL*
wonderfully
fair
complexion
,
keen
blue
eyes
,
and
curls
,
more
golden
and
*NL*
abundant
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
three
wore
suits
of
thin
silver
gray
-LRB-
their
best
gowns
for
the
*NL*
summer
-RRB-
,
with
blush-roses
in
hair
and
bosom
;
and
all
three
looked
just
*NL*
what
they
were
,
--
fresh-faced
,
happy-hearted
girls
,
pausing
a
moment
in
*NL*
their
busy
lives
to
read
with
wistful
eyes
the
sweetest
chapter
in
the
*NL*
romance
of
womanhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
to
be
no
ceremonious
performances
,
everything
was
to
be
as
*NL*
natural
and
homelike
as
possible
;
so
when
Aunt
March
arrived
,
she
was
*NL*
scandalized
to
see
the
bride
come
running
to
welcome
and
lead
her
in
,
to
*NL*
find
the
bridegroom
fastening
up
a
garland
that
had
fallen
down
,
and
to
*NL*
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
paternal
minister
marching
upstairs
with
a
grave
*NL*
countenance
,
and
a
wine-bottle
under
each
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
here
's
a
state
of
things
!
''
cried
the
old
lady
,
taking
the
*NL*
seat
of
honor
prepared
for
her
,
and
settling
the
folds
of
her
lavender
*NL*
_
moire
_
with
a
great
rustle
.
``
You
ought
n't
to
be
seen
till
the
last
*NL*
minute
,
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
a
show
,
aunty
,
and
no
one
is
coming
to
stare
at
me
,
to
*NL*
criticise
my
dress
,
or
count
the
cost
of
my
luncheon
.
I
'm
too
happy
to
*NL*
care
what
any
one
says
or
thinks
,
and
I
'm
going
to
have
my
little
*NL*
wedding
just
as
I
like
it
.
John
,
dear
,
here
's
your
hammer
;
''
and
away
*NL*
went
Meg
to
help
``
that
man
''
in
his
highly
improper
employment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Brooke
did
n't
even
say
``
Thank
you
,
''
but
as
he
stooped
for
the
*NL*
unromantic
tool
,
he
kissed
his
little
bride
behind
the
folding-door
,
*NL*
with
a
look
that
made
Aunt
March
whisk
out
her
pocket-handkerchief
,
with
*NL*
a
sudden
dew
in
her
sharp
old
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
crash
,
a
cry
,
and
a
laugh
from
Laurie
,
accompanied
by
the
indecorous
*NL*
exclamation
,
``
Jupiter
Ammon
!
Jo
's
upset
the
cake
again
!
''
caused
a
*NL*
momentary
flurry
,
which
was
hardly
over
when
a
flock
of
cousins
arrived
,
*NL*
and
``
the
party
came
in
,
''
as
Beth
used
to
say
when
a
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
that
young
giant
come
near
me
;
he
worries
me
worse
than
*NL*
mosquitoes
,
''
whispered
the
old
lady
to
Amy
,
as
the
rooms
filled
,
and
*NL*
Laurie
's
black
head
towered
above
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
has
promised
to
be
very
good
to-day
,
and
he
_
can
_
be
perfectly
*NL*
elegant
if
he
likes
,
''
returned
Amy
,
gliding
away
to
warn
Hercules
to
*NL*
beware
of
the
dragon
,
which
warning
caused
him
to
haunt
the
old
lady
*NL*
with
a
devotion
that
nearly
distracted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
bridal
procession
,
but
a
sudden
silence
fell
upon
the
room
*NL*
as
Mr.
March
and
the
young
pair
took
their
places
under
the
green
arch
.
*NL*
Mother
and
sisters
gathered
close
,
as
if
loath
to
give
Meg
up
;
the
*NL*
fatherly
voice
broke
more
than
once
,
which
only
seemed
to
make
the
*NL*
service
more
beautiful
and
solemn
;
the
bridegroom
's
hand
trembled
*NL*
visibly
,
and
no
one
heard
his
replies
;
but
Meg
looked
straight
up
in
her
*NL*
husband
's
eyes
,
and
said
,
``
I
will
!
''
with
such
tender
trust
in
her
own
*NL*
face
and
voice
that
her
mother
's
heart
rejoiced
,
and
Aunt
March
sniffed
*NL*
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
did
_
not
_
cry
,
though
she
was
very
near
it
once
,
and
was
only
saved
*NL*
from
a
demonstration
by
the
consciousness
that
Laurie
was
staring
*NL*
fixedly
at
her
,
with
a
comical
mixture
of
merriment
and
emotion
in
his
*NL*
wicked
black
eyes
.
Beth
kept
her
face
hidden
on
her
mother
's
shoulder
,
*NL*
but
Amy
stood
like
a
graceful
statue
,
with
a
most
becoming
ray
of
*NL*
sunshine
touching
her
white
forehead
and
the
flower
in
her
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
n't
at
all
the
thing
,
I
'm
afraid
,
but
the
minute
she
was
fairly
*NL*
married
,
Meg
cried
,
``
The
first
kiss
for
Marmee
!
''
and
,
turning
,
gave
it
*NL*
with
her
heart
on
her
lips
.
During
the
next
fifteen
minutes
she
looked
*NL*
more
like
a
rose
than
ever
,
for
every
one
availed
themselves
of
their
*NL*
privileges
to
the
fullest
extent
,
from
Mr.
Laurence
to
old
Hannah
,
who
,
*NL*
adorned
with
a
head-dress
fearfully
and
wonderfully
made
,
fell
upon
her
*NL*
in
the
hall
,
crying
,
with
a
sob
and
a
chuckle
,
``
Bless
you
,
deary
,
a
*NL*
hundred
times
!
The
cake
ai
n't
hurt
a
mite
,
and
everything
looks
lovely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
cleared
up
after
that
,
and
said
something
brilliant
,
or
tried
*NL*
to
,
which
did
just
as
well
,
for
laughter
is
ready
when
hearts
are
light
.
*NL*
There
was
no
display
of
gifts
,
for
they
were
already
in
the
little
*NL*
house
,
nor
was
there
an
elaborate
breakfast
,
but
a
plentiful
lunch
of
*NL*
cake
and
fruit
,
dressed
with
flowers
.
Mr.
Laurence
and
Aunt
March
*NL*
shrugged
and
smiled
at
one
another
when
water
,
lemonade
,
and
coffee
were
*NL*
found
to
be
the
only
sorts
of
nectar
which
the
three
Hebes
carried
*NL*
round
.
No
one
said
anything
,
however
,
till
Laurie
,
who
insisted
on
*NL*
serving
the
bride
,
appeared
before
her
,
with
a
loaded
salver
in
his
hand
*NL*
and
a
puzzled
expression
on
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
Jo
smashed
all
the
bottles
by
accident
?
''
he
whispered
,
``
or
am
I
*NL*
merely
laboring
under
a
delusion
that
I
saw
some
lying
about
loose
this
*NL*
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
your
grandfather
kindly
offered
us
his
best
,
and
Aunt
March
*NL*
actually
sent
some
,
but
father
put
away
a
little
for
Beth
,
and
*NL*
despatched
the
rest
to
the
Soldiers
'
Home
.
You
know
he
thinks
that
wine
*NL*
should
be
used
only
in
illness
,
and
mother
says
that
neither
she
nor
her
*NL*
daughters
will
ever
offer
it
to
any
young
man
under
her
roof
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
spoke
seriously
,
and
expected
to
see
Laurie
frown
or
laugh
;
but
he
*NL*
did
neither
,
for
after
a
quick
look
at
her
,
he
said
,
in
his
impetuous
*NL*
way
,
``
I
like
that
!
for
I
've
seen
enough
harm
done
to
wish
other
women
*NL*
would
think
as
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
made
wise
by
experience
,
I
hope
?
''
and
there
was
an
anxious
*NL*
accent
in
Meg
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
give
you
my
word
for
it
.
Do
n't
think
too
well
of
me
,
either
;
this
*NL*
is
not
one
of
my
temptations
.
Being
brought
up
where
wine
is
as
common
*NL*
as
water
,
and
almost
as
harmless
,
I
do
n't
care
for
it
;
but
when
a
pretty
*NL*
girl
offers
it
,
one
does
n't
like
to
refuse
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
,
for
the
sake
of
others
,
if
not
for
your
own
.
Come
,
*NL*
Laurie
,
promise
,
and
give
me
one
more
reason
to
call
this
the
happiest
*NL*
day
of
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
demand
so
sudden
and
so
serious
made
the
young
man
hesitate
a
moment
,
*NL*
for
ridicule
is
often
harder
to
bear
than
self-denial
.
Meg
knew
that
if
*NL*
he
gave
the
promise
he
would
keep
it
at
all
costs
;
and
,
feeling
her
*NL*
power
,
used
it
as
a
woman
may
for
her
friend
's
good
.
She
did
not
speak
,
*NL*
but
she
looked
up
at
him
with
a
face
made
very
eloquent
by
happiness
,
*NL*
and
a
smile
which
said
,
``
No
one
can
refuse
me
anything
to-day
.
''
Laurie
*NL*
certainly
could
not
;
and
,
with
an
answering
smile
,
he
gave
her
his
hand
,
*NL*
saying
heartily
,
``
I
promise
,
Mrs.
Brooke
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
very
,
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
drink
`
long
life
to
your
resolution
,
'
Teddy
,
''
cried
Jo
,
baptizing
*NL*
him
with
a
splash
of
lemonade
,
as
she
waved
her
glass
,
and
beamed
*NL*
approvingly
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
toast
was
drunk
,
the
pledge
made
,
and
loyally
kept
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
many
temptations
;
for
,
with
instinctive
wisdom
,
the
girls
had
seized
a
*NL*
happy
moment
to
do
their
friend
a
service
,
for
which
he
thanked
them
all
*NL*
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
lunch
,
people
strolled
about
,
by
twos
and
threes
,
through
house
*NL*
and
garden
,
enjoying
the
sunshine
without
and
within
.
Meg
and
John
*NL*
happened
to
be
standing
together
in
the
middle
of
the
grass-plot
,
when
*NL*
Laurie
was
seized
with
an
inspiration
which
put
the
finishing
touch
to
*NL*
this
unfashionable
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
married
people
take
hands
and
dance
round
the
new-made
husband
*NL*
and
wife
,
as
the
Germans
do
,
while
we
bachelors
and
spinsters
prance
in
*NL*
couples
outside
!
''
cried
Laurie
,
promenading
down
the
path
with
Amy
,
with
*NL*
such
infectious
spirit
and
skill
that
every
one
else
followed
their
*NL*
example
without
a
murmur
.
Mr.
and
Mrs.
March
,
Aunt
and
Uncle
Carrol
,
*NL*
began
it
;
others
rapidly
joined
in
;
even
Sallie
Moffat
,
after
a
moment
's
*NL*
hesitation
,
threw
her
train
over
her
arm
,
and
whisked
Ned
into
the
ring
.
*NL*
But
the
crowning
joke
was
Mr.
Laurence
and
Aunt
March
;
for
when
the
*NL*
stately
old
gentleman
_
chasseed
_
solemnly
up
to
the
old
lady
,
she
just
*NL*
tucked
her
cane
under
her
arm
,
and
hopped
briskly
away
to
join
hands
*NL*
with
the
rest
,
and
dance
about
the
bridal
pair
,
while
the
young
folks
*NL*
pervaded
the
garden
,
like
butterflies
on
a
midsummer
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Want
of
breath
brought
the
impromptu
ball
to
a
close
,
and
then
people
*NL*
began
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
well
,
my
dear
,
I
heartily
wish
you
well
;
but
I
think
you
'll
*NL*
be
sorry
for
it
,
''
said
Aunt
March
to
Meg
,
adding
to
the
bridegroom
,
as
*NL*
he
led
her
to
the
carriage
,
``
You
've
got
a
treasure
,
young
man
,
see
that
*NL*
you
deserve
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
prettiest
wedding
I
've
been
to
for
an
age
,
Ned
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
why
,
for
there
was
n't
a
bit
of
style
about
it
,
''
observed
Mrs.
Moffat
*NL*
to
her
husband
,
as
they
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laurie
,
my
lad
,
if
you
ever
want
to
indulge
in
this
sort
of
thing
,
get
*NL*
one
of
those
little
girls
to
help
you
,
and
I
shall
be
perfectly
*NL*
satisfied
,
''
said
Mr.
Laurence
,
settling
himself
in
his
easy-chair
to
*NL*
rest
,
after
the
excitement
of
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
my
best
to
gratify
you
,
sir
,
''
was
Laurie
's
unusually
dutiful
*NL*
reply
,
as
he
carefully
unpinned
the
posy
Jo
had
put
in
his
button-hole
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
house
was
not
far
away
,
and
the
only
bridal
journey
Meg
had
*NL*
was
the
quiet
walk
with
John
,
from
the
old
home
to
the
new
.
When
she
*NL*
came
down
,
looking
like
a
pretty
Quakeress
in
her
dove-colored
suit
and
*NL*
straw
bonnet
tied
with
white
,
they
all
gathered
about
her
to
say
*NL*
``
good-by
,
''
as
tenderly
as
if
she
had
been
going
to
make
the
grand
tour
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
feel
that
I
am
separated
from
you
,
Marmee
dear
,
or
that
I
love
*NL*
you
any
the
less
for
loving
John
so
much
,
''
she
said
,
clinging
to
her
*NL*
mother
,
with
full
eyes
,
for
a
moment
.
``
I
shall
come
every
day
,
father
,
*NL*
and
expect
to
keep
my
old
place
in
all
your
hearts
,
though
I
_
am
_
*NL*
married
.
Beth
is
going
to
be
with
me
a
great
deal
,
and
the
other
girls
*NL*
will
drop
in
now
and
then
to
laugh
at
my
housekeeping
struggles
.
Thank
*NL*
you
all
for
my
happy
wedding-day
.
Good-by
,
good-by
!

*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
watching
her
,
with
faces
full
of
love
and
hope
and
tender
*NL*
pride
,
as
she
walked
away
,
leaning
on
her
husband
's
arm
,
with
her
hands
*NL*
full
of
flowers
,
and
the
June
sunshine
brightening
her
happy
face
,
--
and
*NL*
so
Meg
's
married
life
began

*NL*
ARTISTIC
ATTEMPTS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
takes
people
a
long
time
to
learn
the
difference
between
talent
and
*NL*
genius
,
especially
ambitious
young
men
and
women
.
Amy
was
learning
this
*NL*
distinction
through
much
tribulation
;
for
,
mistaking
enthusiasm
for
*NL*
inspiration
,
she
attempted
every
branch
of
art
with
youthful
audacity
.
*NL*
For
a
long
time
there
was
a
lull
in
the
``
mud-pie
''
business
,
and
she
*NL*
devoted
herself
to
the
finest
pen-and-ink
drawing
,
in
which
she
showed
*NL*
such
taste
and
skill
that
her
graceful
handiwork
proved
both
pleasant
*NL*
and
profitable
.
But
overstrained
eyes
soon
caused
pen
and
ink
to
be
laid
*NL*
aside
for
a
bold
attempt
at
poker-sketching
.
While
this
attack
lasted
,
*NL*
the
family
lived
in
constant
fear
of
a
conflagration
;
for
the
odor
of
*NL*
burning
wood
pervaded
the
house
at
all
hours
;
smoke
issued
from
attic
*NL*
and
shed
with
alarming
frequency
,
red-hot
pokers
lay
about
*NL*
promiscuously
,
and
Hannah
never
went
to
bed
without
a
pail
of
water
and
*NL*
the
dinner-bell
at
her
door
,
in
case
of
fire
.
Raphael
's
face
was
found
*NL*
boldly
executed
on
the
under
side
of
the
moulding-board
,
and
Bacchus
on
*NL*
the
head
of
a
beer-barrel
;
a
chanting
cherub
adorned
the
cover
of
the
*NL*
sugar-bucket
,
and
attempts
to
portray
Romeo
and
Juliet
supplied
*NL*
kindlings
for
some
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
fire
to
oil
was
a
natural
transition
for
burnt
fingers
,
and
Amy
*NL*
fell
to
painting
with
undiminished
ardor
.
An
artist
friend
fitted
her
*NL*
out
with
his
cast-off
palettes
,
brushes
,
and
colors
;
and
she
daubed
*NL*
away
,
producing
pastoral
and
marine
views
such
as
were
never
seen
on
*NL*
land
or
sea
.
Her
monstrosities
in
the
way
of
cattle
would
have
taken
*NL*
prizes
at
an
agricultural
fair
;
and
the
perilous
pitching
of
her
vessels
*NL*
would
have
produced
sea-sickness
in
the
most
nautical
observer
,
if
the
*NL*
utter
disregard
to
all
known
rules
of
shipbuilding
and
rigging
had
not
*NL*
convulsed
him
with
laughter
at
the
first
glance
.
Swarthy
boys
and
*NL*
dark-eyed
Madonnas
,
staring
at
you
from
one
corner
of
the
studio
,
*NL*
suggested
Murillo
;
oily-brown
shadows
of
faces
,
with
a
lurid
streak
in
*NL*
the
wrong
place
,
meant
Rembrandt
;
buxom
ladies
and
dropsical
infants
,
*NL*
Rubens
;
and
Turner
appeared
in
tempests
of
blue
thunder
,
orange
*NL*
lightning
,
brown
rain
,
and
purple
clouds
,
with
a
tomato-colored
splash
*NL*
in
the
middle
,
which
might
be
the
sun
or
a
buoy
,
a
sailor
's
shirt
or
a
*NL*
king
's
robe
,
as
the
spectator
pleased
.
*NL*
*NL*
Charcoal
portraits
came
next
;
and
the
entire
family
hung
in
a
row
,
*NL*
looking
as
wild
and
crocky
as
if
just
evoked
from
a
coal-bin
.
Softened
*NL*
into
crayon
sketches
,
they
did
better
;
for
the
likenesses
were
good
,
and
*NL*
Amy
's
hair
,
Jo
's
nose
,
Meg
's
mouth
,
and
Laurie
's
eyes
were
pronounced
*NL*
``
wonderfully
fine
.
''
A
return
to
clay
and
plaster
followed
,
and
ghostly
*NL*
casts
of
her
acquaintances
haunted
corners
of
the
house
,
or
tumbled
off
*NL*
closet-shelves
on
to
people
's
heads
.
Children
were
enticed
in
as
models
,
*NL*
till
their
incoherent
accounts
of
her
mysterious
doings
caused
Miss
Amy
*NL*
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
young
ogress
.
Her
efforts
in
this
line
,
*NL*
however
,
were
brought
to
an
abrupt
close
by
an
untoward
accident
,
which
*NL*
quenched
her
ardor
.
Other
models
failing
her
for
a
time
,
she
undertook
*NL*
to
cast
her
own
pretty
foot
,
and
the
family
were
one
day
alarmed
by
an
*NL*
unearthly
bumping
and
screaming
,
and
running
to
the
rescue
,
found
the
*NL*
young
enthusiast
hopping
wildly
about
the
shed
,
with
her
foot
held
fast
*NL*
in
a
pan-full
of
plaster
,
which
had
hardened
with
unexpected
rapidity
.
*NL*
With
much
difficulty
and
some
danger
she
was
dug
out
;
for
Jo
was
so
*NL*
overcome
with
laughter
while
she
excavated
,
that
her
knife
went
too
far
,
*NL*
cut
the
poor
foot
,
and
left
a
lasting
memorial
of
one
artistic
attempt
,
*NL*
at
least
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
Amy
subsided
,
till
a
mania
for
sketching
from
nature
set
her
*NL*
to
haunting
river
,
field
,
and
wood
,
for
picturesque
studies
,
and
sighing
*NL*
for
ruins
to
copy
.
She
caught
endless
colds
sitting
on
damp
grass
to
*NL*
book
``
a
delicious
bit
,
''
composed
of
a
stone
,
a
stump
,
one
mushroom
,
and
*NL*
a
broken
mullein-stalk
,
or
``
a
heavenly
mass
of
clouds
,
''
that
looked
like
*NL*
a
choice
display
of
feather-beds
when
done
.
She
sacrificed
her
*NL*
complexion
floating
on
the
river
in
the
midsummer
sun
,
to
study
light
*NL*
and
shade
,
and
got
a
wrinkle
over
her
nose
,
trying
after
``
points
of
*NL*
sight
,
''
or
whatever
the
squint-and-string
performance
is
called
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
``
genius
is
eternal
patience
,
''
as
Michael
Angelo
affirms
,
Amy
*NL*
certainly
had
some
claim
to
the
divine
attribute
,
for
she
persevered
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
obstacles
,
failures
,
and
discouragements
,
firmly
believing
*NL*
that
in
time
she
should
do
something
worthy
to
be
called
``
high
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
learning
,
doing
,
and
enjoying
other
things
,
meanwhile
,
for
she
*NL*
had
resolved
to
be
an
attractive
and
accomplished
woman
,
even
if
she
*NL*
never
became
a
great
artist
.
Here
she
succeeded
better
;
for
she
was
one
*NL*
of
those
happily
created
beings
who
please
without
effort
,
make
friends
*NL*
everywhere
,
and
take
life
so
gracefully
and
easily
that
less
fortunate
*NL*
souls
are
tempted
to
believe
that
such
are
born
under
a
lucky
star
.
*NL*
Everybody
liked
her
,
for
among
her
good
gifts
was
tact
.
She
had
an
*NL*
instinctive
sense
of
what
was
pleasing
and
proper
,
always
said
the
right
*NL*
thing
to
the
right
person
,
did
just
what
suited
the
time
and
place
,
and
*NL*
was
so
self-possessed
that
her
sisters
used
to
say
,
``
If
Amy
went
to
*NL*
court
without
any
rehearsal
beforehand
,
she
'd
know
exactly
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
her
weaknesses
was
a
desire
to
move
in
``
our
best
society
,
''
*NL*
without
being
quite
sure
what
the
_
best
_
really
was
.
Money
,
position
,
*NL*
fashionable
accomplishments
,
and
elegant
manners
were
most
desirable
*NL*
things
in
her
eyes
,
and
she
liked
to
associate
with
those
who
possessed
*NL*
them
,
often
mistaking
the
false
for
the
true
,
and
admiring
what
was
not
*NL*
admirable
.
Never
forgetting
that
by
birth
she
was
a
gentlewoman
,
she
*NL*
cultivated
her
aristocratic
tastes
and
feelings
,
so
that
when
the
*NL*
opportunity
came
she
might
be
ready
to
take
the
place
from
which
poverty
*NL*
now
excluded
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lady
,
''
as
her
friends
called
her
,
sincerely
desired
to
be
a
genuine
*NL*
lady
,
and
was
so
at
heart
,
but
had
yet
to
learn
that
money
can
not
buy
*NL*
refinement
of
nature
,
that
rank
does
not
always
confer
nobility
,
and
*NL*
that
true
breeding
makes
itself
felt
in
spite
of
external
drawbacks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
,
mamma
,
''
Amy
said
,
coming
in
,
with
an
*NL*
important
air
,
one
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
little
girl
,
what
is
it
?
''
replied
her
mother
,
in
whose
eyes
the
*NL*
stately
young
lady
still
remained
``
the
baby
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
drawing
class
breaks
up
next
week
,
and
before
the
girls
separate
*NL*
for
the
summer
,
I
want
to
ask
them
out
here
for
a
day
.
They
are
wild
to
*NL*
see
the
river
,
sketch
the
broken
bridge
,
and
copy
some
of
the
things
*NL*
they
admire
in
my
book
.
They
have
been
very
kind
to
me
in
many
ways
,
and
*NL*
I
am
grateful
,
for
they
are
all
rich
,
and
know
I
am
poor
,
yet
they
never
*NL*
made
any
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
they
?
''
and
Mrs.
March
put
the
question
with
what
the
girls
*NL*
called
her
``
Maria
Theresa
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
as
well
as
I
that
it
_
does
_
make
a
difference
with
nearly
*NL*
every
one

so
do
n't
ruffle
up
,
like
a
dear
,
motherly
hen
,
when
your
*NL*
chickens
get
pecked
by
smarter
birds
;
the
ugly
duckling
turned
out

and
Amy
smiled
without
bitterness
,
for
she
possessed
a
*NL*
happy
temper
and
hopeful
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
laughed
,
and
smoothed
down
her
maternal
pride
as
she
asked
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

swan

what
is
your
plan

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

places

want

see

Mrs.
March
knew
that
experience
was
an
excellent
teacher
,
and
when
it
*NL*
was
possible
she
left
her
children
to
learn
alone
the
lessons
which
she
*NL*
would
gladly
have
made
easier
,
if
they
had
not
objected
to
taking
advice
*NL*
as
much
as
they
did
salts
and
senna
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Amy
;
if
your
heart
is
set
upon
it
,
and
you
see
your
way
*NL*
through
without
too
great
an
outlay
of
money
,
time
,
and
temper
,
I
'll
say
*NL*
no
more
.
Talk
it
over
with
the
girls
,
and
whichever
way
you
decide
,
I
'll
*NL*
do
my
best
to
help
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
mother
;
you
are
always
_
so
_
kind
;
''
and
away
went
Amy
to
lay
her
*NL*
plan
before
her
sisters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
agreed
at
once
,
and
promised
her
aid
,
gladly
offering
anything
she
*NL*
possessed
,
from
her
little
house
itself
to
her
very
best
salt-spoons
.
*NL*
But
Jo
frowned
upon
the
whole
project
,
and
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
it
at
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
in
the
world
should
you
spend
your
money
,
worry
your
family
,
and
*NL*
turn
the
house
upside
down
for
a
parcel
of
girls
who
do
n't
care
a
*NL*
sixpence
for
you
?
I
thought
you
had
too
much
pride
and
sense
to
truckle
*NL*
to
any
mortal
woman
just
because
she
wears
French
boots
and
rides
in
a
*NL*
_
coupe
_
,
''
said
Jo
,
who
,
being
called
from
the
tragical
climax
of
her
*NL*
novel
,
was
not
in
the
best
mood
for
social
enterprises
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
do
n't
_
truckle
,
and
I
hate
being
patronized
as
much
as
you
do
!
''
*NL*
returned
Amy
indignantly
,
for
the
two
still
jangled
when
such
questions
*NL*
arose
.
``
The
girls
do
care
for
me
,
and
I
for
them
,
and
there
's
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
kindness
and
sense
and
talent
among
them
,
in
spite
of
what
you
*NL*
call
fashionable
nonsense
.
You
do
n't
care
to
make
people
like
you
,
to
go
*NL*
into
good
society
,
and
cultivate
your
manners
and
tastes
.
I
do
,
and
I
*NL*
mean
to
make
the
most
of
every
chance
that
comes
.
_
You
_
can
go
through
*NL*
the
world
with
your
elbows
out
and
your
nose
in
the
air
,
and
call
it
*NL*
independence
,
if
you
like
.
That
's
not
my
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Amy
whetted
her
tongue
and
freed
her
mind
she
usually
got
the
best
*NL*
of
it
,
for
she
seldom
failed
to
have
common
sense
on
her
side
,
while
Jo
*NL*
carried
her
love
of
liberty
and
hate
of
conventionalities
to
such
an
*NL*
unlimited
extent
that
she
naturally
found
herself
worsted
in
an
*NL*
argument
.
Amy
's
definition
of
Jo
's
idea
of
independence
was
such
a
good
*NL*
hit
that
both
burst
out
laughing
,
and
the
discussion
took
a
more
amiable
*NL*
turn
.
Much
against
her
will
,
Jo
at
length
consented
to
sacrifice
a
day
*NL*
to
Mrs.
Grundy
,
and
help
her
sister
through
what
she
regarded
as
``
a
*NL*
nonsensical
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
invitations
were
sent
,
nearly
all
accepted
,
and
the
following
Monday
*NL*
was
set
apart
for
the
grand
event
.
Hannah
was
out
of
humor
because
her
*NL*
week
's
work
was
deranged
,
and
prophesied
that
``
ef
the
washin
'
and
*NL*
ironin
'
war
n't
done
reg
`
lar
nothin
'
would
go
well
anywheres
.
''
This
hitch
*NL*
in
the
mainspring
of
the
domestic
machinery
had
a
bad
effect
upon
the
*NL*
whole
concern
;
but
Amy
's
motto
was
``
Nil
desperandum
,
''
and
having
made
up
*NL*
her
mind
what
to
do
,
she
proceeded
to
do
it
in
spite
of
all
obstacles
.
*NL*
To
begin
with
,
Hannah
's
cooking
did
n't
turn
out
well
:
the
chicken
was
*NL*
tough
,
the
tongue
too
salt
,
and
the
chocolate
would
n't
froth
properly
.
*NL*
Then
the
cake
and
ice
cost
more
than
Amy
expected
,
so
did
the
wagon
;
and
*NL*
various
other
expenses
,
which
seemed
trifling
at
the
outset
,
counted
up
*NL*
rather
alarmingly
afterward
.
Beth
got
cold
and
took
to
her
bed
,
Meg
had
*NL*
an
unusual
number
of
callers
to
keep
her
at
home
,
and
Jo
was
in
such
a
*NL*
divided
state
of
mind
that
her
breakages
,
accidents
,
and
mistakes
were
*NL*
uncommonly
numerous
,
serious
,
and
trying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
n't
been
for
mother
I
never
should
have
got
through
,
''
as
Amy
*NL*
declared
afterward
,
and
gratefully
remembered
when
``
the
best
joke
of
the
*NL*
season
''
was
entirely
forgotten
by
everybody
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
it
was
not
fair
on
Monday
,
the
young
ladies
were
to
come
on
*NL*
Tuesday
,
--
an
arrangement
which
aggravated
Jo
and
Hannah
to
the
last
*NL*
degree
.
On
Monday
morning
the
weather
was
in
that
undecided
state
which
*NL*
is
more
exasperating
than
a
steady
pour
.
It
drizzled
a
little
,
shone
a
*NL*
little
,
blew
a
little
,
and
did
n't
make
up
its
mind
till
it
was
too
late
*NL*
for
any
one
else
to
make
up
theirs
.
Amy
was
up
at
dawn
,
hustling
people
*NL*
out
of
their
beds
and
through
their
breakfasts
,
that
the
house
might
be
*NL*
got
in
order
.
The
parlor
struck
her
as
looking
uncommonly
shabby
;
but
*NL*
without
stopping
to
sigh
for
what
she
had
not
,
she
skilfully
made
the
*NL*
best
of
what
she
had
,
arranging
chairs
over
the
worn
places
in
the
*NL*
carpet
,
covering
stains
on
the
walls
with
pictures
framed
in
ivy
,
and
*NL*
filling
up
empty
corners
with
home-made
statuary
,
which
gave
an
artistic
*NL*
air
to
the
room
,
as
did
the
lovely
vases
of
flowers
Jo
scattered
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lunch
looked
charmingly
;
and
as
she
surveyed
it
,
she
sincerely
hoped
*NL*
it
would
taste
well
,
and
that
the
borrowed
glass
,
china
,
and
silver
*NL*
would
get
safely
home
again
.
The
carriages
were
promised
,
Meg
and
mother
*NL*
were
all
ready
to
do
the
honors
,
Beth
was
able
to
help
Hannah
behind
the
*NL*
scenes
,
Jo
had
engaged
to
be
as
lively
and
amiable
as
an
absent
mind
,
an
*NL*
aching
head
,
and
a
very
decided
disapproval
of
everybody
and
everything
*NL*
would
allow
,
and
,
as
she
wearily
dressed
,
Amy
cheered
herself
with
*NL*
anticipations
of
the
happy
moment
,
when
,
lunch
safely
over
,
she
should
*NL*
drive
away
with
her
friends
for
an
afternoon
of
artistic
delights
;
for
*NL*
the
``
cherry-bounce
''
and
the
broken
bridge
were
her
strong
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
two
hours
of
suspense
,
during
which
she
vibrated
from
parlor
*NL*
to
porch
,
while
public
opinion
varied
like
the
weathercock
.
A
smart
*NL*
shower
at
eleven
had
evidently
quenched
the
enthusiasm
of
the
young
*NL*
ladies
who
were
to
arrive
at
twelve
,
for
nobody
came
;
and
at
two
the
*NL*
exhausted
family
sat
down
in
a
blaze
of
sunshine
to
consume
the
*NL*
perishable
portions
of
the
feast
,
that
nothing
might
be
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
about
the
weather
to-day
;
they
will
certainly
come
,
so
we
must
*NL*
fly
round
and
be
ready
for
them
,
''
said
Amy
,
as
the
sun
woke
her
next
*NL*
morning
.
She
spoke
briskly
,
but
in
her
secret
soul
she
wished
she
had
*NL*
said
nothing
about
Tuesday
,
for
her
interest
,
like
her
cake
,
was
getting
*NL*
a
little
stale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
get
any
lobsters
,
so
you
will
have
to
do
without
salad
to-day
,
''
*NL*
said
Mr.
March
,
coming
in
half
an
hour
later
,
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
placid
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Use
the
chicken
,
then
;
the
toughness
wo
n't
matter
in
a
salad
,
''
advised
*NL*
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hannah
left
it
on
the
kitchen-table
a
minute
,
and
the
kittens
got
at
*NL*
it
.
I
'm
very
sorry
,
Amy
,
''
added
Beth
,
who
was
still
a
patroness
of
cats
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
_
must
_
have
a
lobster
,
for
tongue
alone
wo
n't
do
,
''
said
Amy
*NL*
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
rush
into
town
and
demand
one
?
''
asked
Jo
,
with
the
magnanimity
*NL*
of
a
martyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
come
bringing
it
home
under
your
arm
,
without
any
paper
,
just
to
*NL*
try
me
.
I
'll
go
myself
,
''
answered
Amy
,
whose
temper
was
beginning
to
*NL*
fail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shrouded
in
a
thick
veil
and
armed
with
a
genteel
travelling-basket
,
she
*NL*
departed
,
feeling
that
a
cool
drive
would
soothe
her
ruffled
spirit
,
and
*NL*
fit
her
for
the
labors
of
the
day
.
After
some
delay
,
the
object
of
her
*NL*
desire
was
procured
,
likewise
a
bottle
of
dressing
,
to
prevent
further
*NL*
loss
of
time
at
home
,
and
off
she
drove
again
,
well
pleased
with
her
own
*NL*
forethought
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
omnibus
contained
only
one
other
passenger
,
a
sleepy
old
lady
,
*NL*
Amy
pocketed
her
veil
,
and
beguiled
the
tedium
of
the
way
by
trying
to
*NL*
find
out
where
all
her
money
had
gone
to
.
So
busy
was
she
with
her
card
*NL*
full
of
refractory
figures
that
she
did
not
observe
a
new-comer
,
who
*NL*
entered
without
stopping
the
vehicle
,
till
a
masculine
voice
said
,
*NL*
``
Good-morning
,
Miss
March
,
''
and
,
looking
up
,
she
beheld
one
of
Laurie
's
*NL*
most
elegant
college
friends
.
Fervently
hoping
that
he
would
get
out
*NL*
before
she
did
,
Amy
utterly
ignored
the
basket
at
her
feet
,
and
,
*NL*
congratulating
herself
that
she
had
on
her
new
travelling
dress
,
*NL*
returned
the
young
man
's
greeting
with
her
usual
suavity
and
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
got
on
excellently
;
for
Amy
's
chief
care
was
soon
set
at
rest
by
*NL*
learning
that
the
gentleman
would
leave
first
,
and
she
was
chatting
away
*NL*
in
a
peculiarly
lofty
strain
,
when
the
old
lady
got
out
.
In
stumbling
to
*NL*
the
door
,
she
upset
the
basket
,
and
--
oh
,
horror
!
--
the
lobster
,
in
all
*NL*
its
vulgar
size
and
brilliancy
,
was
revealed
to
the
highborn
eyes
of
a
*NL*
Tudor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
,
she
's
forgotten
her
dinner
!
''
cried
the
unconscious
youth
,
*NL*
poking
the
scarlet
monster
into
its
place
with
his
cane
,
and
preparing
*NL*
to
hand
out
the
basket
after
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
--
it
's
--
it
's
mine
,
''
murmured
Amy
,
with
a
face
nearly
as
red
*NL*
as
her
fish
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration
:
Please
do
n't
,
it
's
mine
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
really
,
I
beg
pardon
;
it
's
an
uncommonly
fine
one
,
is
n't
it
?
''
said
*NL*
Tudor
,
with
great
presence
of
mind
,
and
an
air
of
sober
interest
that
*NL*
did
credit
to
his
breeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
recovered
herself
in
a
breath
,
set
her
basket
boldly
on
the
seat
,
*NL*
and
said
,
laughing
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
wish
you
were
to
have
some
of
the
salad
he
's
to
make
,
and
to
*NL*
see
the
charming
young
ladies
who
are
to
eat
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
was
tact
,
for
two
of
the
ruling
foibles
of
the
masculine
mind
*NL*
were
touched
:
the
lobster
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
halo
of
pleasing
*NL*
reminiscences
,
and
curiosity
about
``
the
charming
young
ladies
''
diverted
*NL*
his
mind
from
the
comical
mishap
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
he
'll
laugh
and
joke
over
it
with
Laurie
,
but
I
sha
'n'
t
see
*NL*
them
;
that
's
a
comfort
,
''
thought
Amy
,
as
Tudor
bowed
and
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
mention
this
meeting
at
home
-LRB-
though
she
discovered
that
,
*NL*
thanks
to
the
upset
,
her
new
dress
was
much
damaged
by
the
rivulets
of
*NL*
dressing
that
meandered
down
the
skirt
-RRB-
,
but
went
through
with
the
*NL*
preparations
which
now
seemed
more
irksome
than
before
;
and
at
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
all
was
ready
again
.
Feeling
that
the
neighbors
were
interested
*NL*
in
her
movements
,
she
wished
to
efface
the
memory
of
yesterday
's
*NL*
failure
by
a
grand
success
to-day
;
so
she
ordered
the
``
cherry-bounce
,
''
*NL*
and
drove
away
in
state
to
meet
and
escort
her
guests
to
the
banquet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
the
rumble
,
they
're
coming
!
I
'll
go
into
the
porch
to
meet
*NL*
them
;
it
looks
hospitable
,
and
I
want
the
poor
child
to
have
a
good
time
*NL*
after
all
her
trouble
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
.
*NL*
But
after
one
glance
,
she
retired
,
with
an
indescribable
expression
,
*NL*
for
,
looking
quite
lost
in
the
big
carriage
,
sat
Amy
and
one
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
,
Beth
,
and
help
Hannah
clear
half
the
things
off
the
table
;
it
will
*NL*
be
too
absurd
to
put
a
luncheon
for
twelve
before
a
single
girl
,
''
cried
*NL*
Jo
,
hurrying
away
to
the
lower
regions
,
too
excited
to
stop
even
for
a
*NL*
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
came
Amy
,
quite
calm
,
and
delightfully
cordial
to
the
one
guest
who
*NL*
had
kept
her
promise
;
the
rest
of
the
family
,
being
of
a
dramatic
turn
,
*NL*
played
their
parts
equally
well
,
and
Miss
Eliott
found
them
a
most
*NL*
hilarious
set
;
for
it
was
impossible
to
entirely
control
the
merriment
*NL*
which
possessed
them
.
The
remodelled
lunch
being
gayly
partaken
of
,
the
*NL*
studio
and
garden
visited
,
and
art
discussed
with
enthusiasm
,
Amy
*NL*
ordered
a
buggy
-LRB-
alas
for
the
elegant
cherry-bounce
!
-RRB-
and
drove
her
*NL*
friend
quietly
about
the
neighborhood
till
sunset
,
when
``
the
party
went
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
came
walking
in
,
looking
very
tired
,
but
as
composed
as
ever
,
she
*NL*
observed
that
every
vestige
of
the
unfortunate
_
fete
_
had
disappeared
,
*NL*
except
a
suspicious
pucker
about
the
corners
of
Jo
's
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
had
a
lovely
afternoon
for
your
drive
,
dear
,
''
said
her
mother
,
*NL*
as
respectfully
as
if
the
whole
twelve
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Eliott
is
a
very
sweet
girl
,
and
seemed
to
enjoy
herself
,
I
*NL*
thought
,
''
observed
Beth
,
with
unusual
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
you
spare
me
some
of
your
cake
?
I
really
need
some
,
I
have
so
*NL*
much
company
,
and
I
ca
n't
make
such
delicious
stuff
as
yours
,
''
asked
Meg
*NL*
soberly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
all
;
I
'm
the
only
one
here
who
likes
sweet
things
,
and
it
will
*NL*
mould
before
I
can
dispose
of
it
,
''
answered
Amy
,
thinking
with
a
sigh
of
*NL*
the
generous
store
she
had
laid
in
for
such
an
end
as
this
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
pity
Laurie
is
n't
here
to
help
us
,
''
began
Jo
,
as
they
sat
down
*NL*
to
ice-cream
and
salad
for
the
second
time
in
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
warning
look
from
her
mother
checked
any
further
remarks
,
and
the
*NL*
whole
family
ate
in
heroic
silence
,
till
Mr.
March
mildly
observed
,
*NL*
``
Salad
was
one
of
the
favorite
dishes
of
the
ancients
,
and
Evelyn
''
--
here
*NL*
a
general
explosion
of
laughter
cut
short
the
``
history
of
sallets
,
''
to
*NL*
the
great
surprise
of
the
learned
gentleman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bundle
everything
into
a
basket
and
send
it
to
the
Hummels
:
Germans
*NL*
like
messes
.
I
'm
sick
of
the
sight
of
this
;
and
there
's
no
reason
you
*NL*
should
all
die
of
a
surfeit
because
I
've
been
a
fool
,
''
cried
Amy
,
wiping
*NL*
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
_
should
_
have
died
when
I
saw
you
two
girls
rattling
about
*NL*
in
the
what-you-call-it
,
like
two
little
kernels
in
a
very
big
nutshell
,
*NL*
and
mother
waiting
in
state
to
receive
the
throng
,
''
sighed
Jo
,
quite
*NL*
spent
with
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
very
sorry
you
were
disappointed
,
dear
,
but
we
all
did
our
best
to
*NL*
satisfy
you
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
in
a
tone
full
of
motherly
regret
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
am
_
satisfied
;
I
've
done
what
I
undertook
,
and
it
's
not
my
fault
*NL*
that
it
failed
;
I
comfort
myself
with
that
,
''
said
Amy
,
with
a
little
*NL*
quiver
in
her
voice
.
``
I
thank
you
all
very
much
for
helping
me
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
thank
you
still
more
if
you
wo
n't
allude
to
it
for
a
month
,
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
did
for
several
months
;
but
the
word
''
_
fete
_
''
always
produced
a
*NL*
general
smile
,
and
Laurie
's
birthday
gift
to
Amy
was
a
tiny
coral
*NL*
lobster
in
the
shape
of
a
charm
for
her
watch-guard
.

LITERARY
LESSONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Fortune
suddenly
smiled
upon
Jo
,
and
dropped
a
good-luck
penny
in
her
*NL*
path
.
Not
a
golden
penny
,
exactly
,
but
I
doubt
if
half
a
million
would
*NL*
have
given
more
real
happiness
than
did
the
little
sum
that
came
to
her
*NL*
in
this
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
few
weeks
she
would
shut
herself
up
in
her
room
,
put
on
her
*NL*
scribbling
suit
,
and
``
fall
into
a
vortex
,
''
as
she
expressed
it
,
writing
*NL*
away
at
her
novel
with
all
her
heart
and
soul
,
for
till
that
was
*NL*
finished
she
could
find
no
peace
.
Her
``
scribbling
suit
''
consisted
of
a
*NL*
black
woollen
pinafore
on
which
she
could
wipe
her
pen
at
will
,
and
a
*NL*
cap
of
the
same
material
,
adorned
with
a
cheerful
red
bow
,
into
which
*NL*
she
bundled
her
hair
when
the
decks
were
cleared
for
action
.
This
cap
*NL*
was
a
beacon
to
the
inquiring
eyes
of
her
family
,
who
during
these
*NL*
periods
kept
their
distance
,
merely
popping
in
their
heads
*NL*
semi-occasionally
,
to
ask
,
with
interest
,
``
Does
genius
burn
,
Jo
?
''
They
*NL*
did
not
always
venture
even
to
ask
this
question
,
but
took
an
*NL*
observation
of
the
cap
,
and
judged
accordingly
.
If
this
expressive
*NL*
article
of
dress
was
drawn
low
upon
the
forehead
,
it
was
a
sign
that
*NL*
hard
work
was
going
on
;
in
exciting
moments
it
was
pushed
rakishly
*NL*
askew
;
and
when
despair
seized
the
author
it
was
plucked
wholly
off
,
and
*NL*
cast
upon
the
floor
.
At
such
times
the
intruder
silently
withdrew
;
and
*NL*
not
until
the
red
bow
was
seen
gayly
erect
upon
the
gifted
brow
,
did
any
*NL*
one
dare
address
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
think
herself
a
genius
by
any
means
;
but
when
the
writing
*NL*
fit
came
on
,
she
gave
herself
up
to
it
with
entire
abandon
,
and
led
a
*NL*
blissful
life
,
unconscious
of
want
,
care
,
or
bad
weather
,
while
she
sat
*NL*
safe
and
happy
in
an
imaginary
world
,
full
of
friends
almost
as
real
and
*NL*
dear
to
her
as
any
in
the
flesh
.
Sleep
forsook
her
eyes
,
meals
stood
*NL*
untasted
,
day
and
night
were
all
too
short
to
enjoy
the
happiness
which
*NL*
blessed
her
only
at
such
times
,
and
made
these
hours
worth
living
,
even
*NL*
if
they
bore
no
other
fruit
.
The
divine
afflatus
usually
lasted
a
week
*NL*
or
two
,
and
then
she
emerged
from
her
``
vortex
,
''
hungry
,
sleepy
,
cross
,
*NL*
or
despondent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
just
recovering
from
one
of
these
attacks
when
she
was
prevailed
*NL*
upon
to
escort
Miss
Crocker
to
a
lecture
,
and
in
return
for
her
virtue
*NL*
was
rewarded
with
a
new
idea
.
It
was
a
People
's
Course
,
the
lecture
on
*NL*
the
Pyramids
,
and
Jo
rather
wondered
at
the
choice
of
such
a
subject
for
*NL*
such
an
audience
,
but
took
it
for
granted
that
some
great
social
evil
*NL*
would
be
remedied
or
some
great
want
supplied
by
unfolding
the
glories
*NL*
of
the
Pharaohs
to
an
audience
whose
thoughts
were
busy
with
the
price
*NL*
of
coal
and
flour
,
and
whose
lives
were
spent
in
trying
to
solve
harder
*NL*
riddles
than
that
of
the
Sphinx
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
early
;
and
while
Miss
Crocker
set
the
heel
of
her
stocking
,
Jo
*NL*
amused
herself
by
examining
the
faces
of
the
people
who
occupied
the
*NL*
seat
with
them
.
On
her
left
were
two
matrons
,
with
massive
foreheads
,
*NL*
and
bonnets
to
match
,
discussing
Woman
's
Rights
and
making
tatting
.
*NL*
Beyond
sat
a
pair
of
humble
lovers
,
artlessly
holding
each
other
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
a
sombre
spinster
eating
peppermints
out
of
a
paper
bag
,
and
an
*NL*
old
gentleman
taking
his
preparatory
nap
behind
a
yellow
bandanna
.
On
*NL*
her
right
,
her
only
neighbor
was
a
studious-looking
lad
absorbed
in
a
*NL*
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pictorial
sheet
,
and
Jo
examined
the
work
of
art
nearest
her
,
*NL*
idly
wondering
what
unfortuitous
concatenation
of
circumstances
needed
*NL*
the
melodramatic
illustration
of
an
Indian
in
full
war
costume
,
tumbling
*NL*
over
a
precipice
with
a
wolf
at
his
throat
,
while
two
infuriated
young
*NL*
gentlemen
,
with
unnaturally
small
feet
and
big
eyes
,
were
stabbing
each
*NL*
other
close
by
,
and
a
dishevelled
female
was
flying
away
in
the
*NL*
background
with
her
mouth
wide
open
.
Pausing
to
turn
a
page
,
the
lad
saw
*NL*
her
looking
,
and
,
with
boyish
good-nature
,
offered
half
his
paper
,
*NL*
saying
bluntly
,
``
Want
to
read
it
?
That
's
a
first-rate
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
accepted
it
with
a
smile
,
for
she
had
never
outgrown
her
liking
for
*NL*
lads
,
and
soon
found
herself
involved
in
the
usual
labyrinth
of
love
,
*NL*
mystery
,
and
murder
,
for
the
story
belonged
to
that
class
of
light
*NL*
literature
in
which
the
passions
have
a
holiday
,
and
when
the
author
's
*NL*
invention
fails
,
a
grand
catastrophe
clears
the
stage
of
one
half
the
*NL*
_
dramatis
personae
_
,
leaving
the
other
half
to
exult
over
their
downfall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prime
,
is
n't
it
?
''
asked
the
boy
,
as
her
eye
went
down
the
last
*NL*
paragraph
of
her
portion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
and
I
could
do
as
well
as
that
if
we
tried
,
''
returned
Jo
,
*NL*
amused
at
his
admiration
of
the
trash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
I
was
a
pretty
lucky
chap
if
I
could
.
She
makes
a
good
*NL*
living
out
of
such
stories
,
they
say
;
''
and
he
pointed
to
the
name
of
*NL*
Mrs.
S.
L.
A.
N.
G.
Northbury
,
under
the
title
of
the
tale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
her
?
''
asked
Jo
,
with
sudden
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
read
all
her
pieces
,
and
I
know
a
fellow
who
works
in
the
*NL*
office
where
this
paper
is
printed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
say
she
makes
a
good
living
out
of
stories
like
this
?
''
and
Jo
*NL*
looked
more
respectfully
at
the
agitated
group
and
thickly-sprinkled
*NL*
exclamation-points
that
adorned
the
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
she
does
!
She
knows
just
what
folks
like
,
and
gets
paid
well
for
*NL*
writing
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
lecture
began
,
but
Jo
heard
very
little
of
it
,
for
while
Prof.
*NL*
Sands
was
prosing
away
about
Belzoni
,
Cheops
,
scarabei
,
and
*NL*
hieroglyphics
,
she
was
covertly
taking
down
the
address
of
the
paper
,
*NL*
and
boldly
resolving
to
try
for
the
hundred-dollar
prize
offered
in
its
*NL*
columns
for
a
sensational
story
.
By
the
time
the
lecture
ended
and
the
*NL*
audience
awoke
,
she
had
built
up
a
splendid
fortune
for
herself
-LRB-
not
the
*NL*
first
founded
upon
paper
-RRB-
,
and
was
already
deep
in
the
concoction
of
her
*NL*
story
,
being
unable
to
decide
whether
the
duel
should
come
before
the
*NL*
elopement
or
after
the
murder
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
of
her
plan
at
home
,
but
fell
to
work
next
day
,
much
to
*NL*
the
disquiet
of
her
mother
,
who
always
looked
a
little
anxious
when
*NL*
``
genius
took
to
burning
.
''
Jo
had
never
tried
this
style
before
,
*NL*
contenting
herself
with
very
mild
romances
for
the
``
Spread
Eagle
.
''
Her
*NL*
theatrical
experience
and
miscellaneous
reading
were
of
service
now
,
for
*NL*
they
gave
her
some
idea
of
dramatic
effect
,
and
supplied
plot
,
language
,
*NL*
and
costumes
.
Her
story
was
as
full
of
desperation
and
despair
as
her
*NL*
limited
acquaintance
with
those
uncomfortable
emotions
enabled
her
to
*NL*
make
it
,
and
,
having
located
it
in
Lisbon
,
she
wound
up
with
an
*NL*
earthquake
,
as
a
striking
and
appropriate
_
denouement
_
.
The
manuscript
*NL*
was
privately
despatched
,
accompanied
by
a
note
,
modestly
saying
that
if
*NL*
the
tale
did
n't
get
the
prize
,
which
the
writer
hardly
dared
expect
,
she
*NL*
would
be
very
glad
to
receive
any
sum
it
might
be
considered
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Six
weeks
is
a
long
time
to
wait
,
and
a
still
longer
time
for
a
girl
to
*NL*
keep
a
secret
;
but
Jo
did
both
,
and
was
just
beginning
to
give
up
all
*NL*
hope
of
ever
seeing
her
manuscript
again
,
when
a
letter
arrived
which
*NL*
almost
took
her
breath
away
;
for
on
opening
it
,
a
check
for
a
hundred
*NL*
dollars
fell
into
her
lap
.
For
a
minute
she
stared
at
it
as
if
it
had
*NL*
been
a
snake
,
then
she
read
her
letter
and
began
to
cry
.
If
the
amiable
*NL*
gentleman
who
wrote
that
kindly
note
could
have
known
what
intense
*NL*
happiness
he
was
giving
a
fellow-creature
,
I
think
he
would
devote
his
*NL*
leisure
hours
,
if
he
has
any
,
to
that
amusement
;
for
Jo
valued
the
*NL*
letter
more
than
the
money
,
because
it
was
encouraging
;
and
after
years
*NL*
of
effort
it
was
_
so
_
pleasant
to
find
that
she
had
learned
to
do
*NL*
something
,
though
it
was
only
to
write
a
sensation
story
.

*NL*
A
prouder
young
woman
was
seldom
seen
than
she
,
when
,
having
composed
*NL*
herself
,
she
electrified
the
family
by
appearing
before
them
with
the
*NL*
letter
in
one
hand
,
the
check
in
the
other
,
announcing
that
she
had
won
*NL*
the
prize
.
Of
course
there
was
a
great
jubilee
,
and
when
the
story
came
*NL*
every
one
read
and
praised
it
;
though
after
her
father
had
told
her
that
*NL*
the
language
was
good
,
the
romance
fresh
and
hearty
,
and
the
tragedy
*NL*
quite
thrilling
,
he
shook
his
head
,
and
said
in
his
unworldly
way
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
do
better

Aim
at

asked
Amy
,
regarding
the
magic
slip
of
paper
with
a

reverential
eye
.
*NL*

``

promptly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
splendid
!
No
,
I
ca
n't
do
it
,
dear
,
it
would
be
so
selfish
,
''
*NL*
cried
Beth
,
who
had
clapped
her
thin
hands
,
and
taken
a
long
breath
,
as
*NL*
if
pining
for
fresh
ocean-breezes
;
then
stopped
herself
,
and
motioned
*NL*
away
the
check
which
her
sister
waved
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
you
shall
go
,
I
've
set
my
heart
on
it
;
that
's
what
I
tried
for
,
*NL*
and
that
's
why
I
succeeded
.
I
never
get
on
when
I
think
of
myself
alone
,
*NL*
so
it
will
help
me
to
work
for
you
,
do
n't
you
see
?
Besides
,
Marmee
needs
*NL*
the
change
,
and
she
wo
n't
leave
you
,
so
you
_
must
_
go
.
Wo
n't
it
be
fun
*NL*
to
see
you
come
home
plump
and
rosy
again
?
Hurrah
for
Dr.
Jo
,
who
always
*NL*
cures
her
patients
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
sea
side
they
went
,
after
much
discussion
;
and
though
Beth
did
n't
*NL*
come
home
as
plump
and
rosy
as
could
be
desired
,
she
was
much
better
,
*NL*
while
Mrs.
March
declared
she
felt
ten
years
younger
;
so
Jo
was
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
investment
of
her
prize
money
,
and
fell
to
work
with
*NL*
a
cheery
spirit
,
bent
on
earning
more
of
those
delightful
checks
.
She
*NL*
did
earn
several
that
year
,
and
began
to
feel
herself
a
power
in
the
*NL*
house
;
for
by
the
magic
of
a
pen
,
her
``
rubbish
''
turned
into
comforts
for
*NL*
them
all
.
``
The
Duke
's
Daughter
''
paid
the
butcher
's
bill
,
``
A
Phantom
*NL*
Hand
''
put
down
a
new
carpet
,
and
the
``
Curse
of
the
Coventrys
''
proved
the
*NL*
blessing
of
the
Marches
in
the
way
of
groceries
and
gowns
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wealth
is
certainly
a
most
desirable
thing
,
but
poverty
has
its
sunny
*NL*
side
,
and
one
of
the
sweet
uses
of
adversity
is
the
genuine
satisfaction
*NL*
which
comes
from
hearty
work
of
head
or
hand
;
and
to
the
inspiration
of
*NL*
necessity
,
we
owe
half
the
wise
,
beautiful
,
and
useful
blessings
of
the
*NL*
world
.
Jo
enjoyed
a
taste
of
this
satisfaction
,
and
ceased
to
envy
*NL*
richer
girls
,
taking
great
comfort
in
the
knowledge
that
she
could
*NL*
supply
her
own
wants
,
and
need
ask
no
one
for
a
penny
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
notice
was
taken
of
her
stories
,
but
they
found
a
market
;
and
,
*NL*
encouraged
by
this
fact
,
she
resolved
to
make
a
bold
stroke
for
fame
and
*NL*
fortune
.
Having
copied
her
novel
for
the
fourth
time
,
read
it
to
all
her
*NL*
confidential
friends
,
and
submitted
it
with
fear
and
trembling
to
three
*NL*
publishers
,
she
at
last
disposed
of
it
,
on
condition
that
she
would
cut
*NL*
it
down
one
third
,
and
omit
all
the
parts
which
she
particularly
*NL*
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
must
either
bundle
it
back
into
my
tin-kitchen
to
mould
,
pay
for
*NL*
printing
it
myself
,
or
chop
it
up
to
suit
purchasers
,
and
get
what
I
can
*NL*
for
it
.
Fame
is
a
very
good
thing
to
have
in
the
house
,
but
cash
is
more
*NL*
convenient
;
so
I
wish
to
take
the
sense
of
the
meeting
on
this
important
*NL*
subject
,
''
said
Jo
,
calling
a
family
council
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
spoil
your
book
,
my
girl
,
for
there
is
more
in
it
than
you
know
,
*NL*
and
the
idea
is
well
worked
out
.
Let
it
wait
and
ripen
,
''
was
her
*NL*
father
's
advice
;
and
he
practised
as
he
preached
,
having
waited
*NL*
patiently
thirty
years
for
fruit
of
his
own
to
ripen
,
and
being
in
no
*NL*
haste
to
gather
it
,
even
now
,
when
it
was
sweet
and
mellow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
that
Jo
will
profit
more
by
making
the
trial
than
by
*NL*
waiting
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
.
``
Criticism
is
the
best
test
of
such
work
,
for
*NL*
it
will
show
her
both
unsuspected
merits
and
faults
,
and
help
her
to
do
*NL*
better
next
time
.
We
are
too
partial
;
but
the
praise
and
blame
of
*NL*
outsiders
will
prove
useful
,
even
if
she
gets
but
little
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Jo
,
knitting
her
brows
,
``
that
's
just
it
;
I
've
been
fussing
*NL*
over
the
thing
so
long
,
I
really
do
n't
know
whether
it
's
good
,
bad
,
or
*NL*
indifferent
.
It
will
be
a
great
help
to
have
cool
,
impartial
persons
*NL*
take
a
look
at
it
,
and
tell
me
what
they
think
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
leave
out
a
word
of
it
;
you
'll
spoil
it
if
you
do
,
for
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
story
is
more
in
the
minds
than
in
the
actions
of
the
*NL*
people
,
and
it
will
be
all
a
muddle
if
you
do
n't
explain
as
you
go
on
,
''
*NL*
said
Meg
,
who
firmly
believed
that
this
book
was
the
most
remarkable
*NL*
novel
ever
written
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
Mr.
Allen
says
,
`
Leave
out
the
explanations
,
make
it
brief
and
*NL*
dramatic
,
and
let
the
characters
tell
the
story
,
'
''
interrupted
Jo
,
*NL*
turning
to
the
publisher
's
note
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
as
he
tells
you
;
he
knows
what
will
sell
,
and
we
do
n't
.
Make
a
good
,
*NL*
popular
book
,
and
get
as
much
money
as
you
can
.
By
and
by
,
when
,
you
've
*NL*
got
a
name
,
you
can
afford
to
digress
,
and
have
philosophical
and
*NL*
metaphysical
people
in
your
novels
,
''
said
Amy
,
who
took
a
strictly
*NL*
practical
view
of
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Jo
,
laughing
,
``
if
my
people
_
are
_
`
philosophical
and
*NL*
metaphysical
,
'
it
is
n't
my
fault
,
for
I
know
nothing
about
such
things
,
*NL*
except
what
I
hear
father
say
,
sometimes
.
If
I
've
got
some
of
his
wise
*NL*
ideas
jumbled
up
with
my
romance
,
so
much
the
better
for
me
.
Now
,
Beth
,
*NL*
what
do
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
so
like
to
see
it
printed
_
soon
_
,
''
was
all
Beth
said
,
and
*NL*
smiled
in
saying
it
;
but
there
was
an
unconscious
emphasis
on
the
last
*NL*
word
,
and
a
wistful
look
in
the
eyes
that
never
lost
their
childlike
*NL*
candor
,
which
chilled
Jo
's
heart
,
for
a
minute
,
with
a
foreboding
fear
,
*NL*
and
decided
her
to
make
her
little
venture
``
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
with
Spartan
firmness
,
the
young
authoress
laid
her
first-born
on
*NL*
her
table
,
and
chopped
it
up
as
ruthlessly
as
any
ogre
.
In
the
hope
of
*NL*
pleasing
every
one
,
she
took
every
one
's
advice
;
and
,
like
the
old
man
*NL*
and
his
donkey
in
the
fable
,
suited
nobody
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
father
liked
the
metaphysical
streak
which
had
unconsciously
got
*NL*
into
it
;
so
that
was
allowed
to
remain
,
though
she
had
her
doubts
about
*NL*
it
.
Her
mother
thought
that
there
_
was
_
a
trifle
too
much
description
;
*NL*
out
,
therefore
,
it
nearly
all
came
,
and
with
it
many
necessary
links
in
*NL*
the
story
.
Meg
admired
the
tragedy
;
so
Jo
piled
up
the
agony
to
suit
*NL*
her
,
while
Amy
objected
to
the
fun
,
and
,
with
the
best
intentions
in
*NL*
life
,
Jo
quenched
the
sprightly
scenes
which
relieved
the
sombre
*NL*
character
of
the
story
.
Then
,
to
complete
the
ruin
,
she
cut
it
down
one
*NL*
third
,
and
confidingly
sent
the
poor
little
romance
,
like
a
picked
*NL*
robin
,
out
into
the
big
,
busy
world
,
to
try
its
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
it
was
printed
,
and
she
got
three
hundred
dollars
for
it
;
likewise
*NL*
plenty
of
praise
and
blame
,
both
so
much
greater
than
she
expected
that
*NL*
she
was
thrown
into
a
state
of
bewilderment
,
from
which
it
took
her
some
*NL*
time
to
recover
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
,
mother
,
that
criticism
would
help
me
;
but
how
can
it
,
when
*NL*
it
's
so
contradictory
that
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
've
written
a
promising
*NL*
book
or
broken
all
the
ten
commandments
?
''
cried
poor
Jo
,
turning
over
a
*NL*
heap
of
notices
,
the
perusal
of
which
filled
her
with
pride
and
joy
one
*NL*
minute
,
wrath
and
dire
dismay
the
next
.
``
This
man
says
`
An
exquisite
*NL*
book
,
full
of
truth
,
beauty
,
and
earnestness
;
all
is
sweet
,
pure
,
and
*NL*
healthy
,
'
''
continued
the
perplexed
authoress
.
``
The
next
,
`
The
theory
of
*NL*
the
book
is
bad
,
full
of
morbid
fancies
,
spiritualistic
ideas
,
and
*NL*
unnatural
characters
.
'
Now
,
as
I
had
no
theory
of
any
kind
,
do
n't
*NL*
believe
in
Spiritualism
,
and
copied
my
characters
from
life
,
I
do
n't
see
*NL*
how
this
critic
_
can
_
be
right
.
Another
says
,
`
It
's
one
of
the
best
*NL*
American
novels
which
has
appeared
for
years
'
-LRB-
I
know
better
than
that
-RRB-
;
*NL*
and
the
next
asserts
that
`
though
it
is
original
,
and
written
with
great
*NL*
force
and
feeling
,
it
is
a
dangerous
book
.
'
'T
is
n't
!
Some
make
fun
of
*NL*
it
,
some
over-praise
,
and
nearly
all
insist
that
I
had
a
deep
theory
to
*NL*
expound
,
when
I
only
wrote
it
for
the
pleasure
and
the
money
.
I
wish
I
'd
*NL*
printed
it
whole
or
not
at
all
,
for
I
do
hate
to
be
so
misjudged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
family
and
friends
administered
comfort
and
commendation
liberally
;
*NL*
yet
it
was
a
hard
time
for
sensitive
,
high-spirited
Jo
,
who
meant
so
*NL*
well
,
and
had
apparently
done
so
ill
.
But
it
did
her
good
,
for
those
*NL*
whose
opinion
had
real
value
gave
her
the
criticism
which
is
an
author
's
*NL*
best
education
;
and
when
the
first
soreness
was
over
,
she
could
laugh
at
*NL*
her
poor
little
book
,
yet
believe
in
it
still
,
and
feel
herself
the
*NL*
wiser
and
stronger
for
the
buffeting
she
had
received
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
being
a
genius
,
like
Keats
,
it
wo
n't
kill
me
,
''
she
said
stoutly
;
*NL*
``
and
I
've
got
the
joke
on
my
side
,
after
all
;
for
the
parts
that
were
*NL*
taken
straight
out
of
real
life
are
denounced
as
impossible
and
absurd
,
*NL*
and
the
scenes
that
I
made
up
out
of
my
own
silly
head
are
pronounced
*NL*
`
charmingly
natural
,
tender
,
and
true
.
'
So
I
'll
comfort
myself
with
*NL*
that
;
and
when
I
'm
ready
,
I
'll
up
again
and
take
another

DOMESTIC
EXPERIENCES
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Like
most
other
young
matrons
,
Meg
began
her
married
life
with
the
*NL*
determination
to
be
a
model
housekeeper
.
John
should
find
home
a
*NL*
paradise
;
he
should
always
see
a
smiling
face
,
should
fare
sumptuously
*NL*
every
day
,
and
never
know
the
loss
of
a
button
.
She
brought
so
much
*NL*
love
,
energy
,
and
cheerfulness
to
the
work
that
she
could
not
but
*NL*
succeed
,
in
spite
of
some
obstacles
.
Her
paradise
was
not
a
tranquil
*NL*
one
;
for
the
little
woman
fussed
,
was
over-anxious
to
please
,
and
*NL*
bustled
about
like
a
true
Martha
,
cumbered
with
many
cares
.
She
was
too
*NL*
tired
,
sometimes
,
even
to
smile
;
John
grew
dyspeptic
after
a
course
of
*NL*
dainty
dishes
,
and
ungratefully
demanded
plain
fare
.
As
for
buttons
,
she
*NL*
soon
learned
to
wonder
where
they
went
,
to
shake
her
head
over
the
*NL*
carelessness
of
men
,
and
to
threaten
to
make
him
sew
them
on
himself
,
*NL*
and
then
see
if
_
his
_
work
would
stand
impatient
tugs
and
clumsy
fingers
*NL*
any
better
than
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
very
happy
,
even
after
they
discovered
that
they
could
n't
live
*NL*
on
love
alone
.
John
did
not
find
Meg
's
beauty
diminished
,
though
she
*NL*
beamed
at
him
from
behind
the
familiar
coffee-pot
;
nor
did
Meg
miss
any
*NL*
of
the
romance
from
the
daily
parting
,
when
her
husband
followed
up
his
*NL*
kiss
with
the
tender
inquiry
,
``
Shall
I
send
home
veal
or
mutton
for
*NL*
dinner
,
darling
?
''
The
little
house
ceased
to
be
a
glorified
bower
,
but
*NL*
it
became
a
home
,
and
the
young
couple
soon
felt
that
it
was
a
change
*NL*
for
the
better
.
At
first
they
played
keep-house
,
and
frolicked
over
it
*NL*
like
children
;
then
John
took
steadily
to
business
,
feeling
the
cares
of
*NL*
the
head
of
a
family
upon
his
shoulders
;
and
Meg
laid
by
her
cambric
*NL*
wrappers
,
put
on
a
big
apron
,
and
fell
to
work
,
as
before
said
,
with
*NL*
more
energy
than
discretion
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
cooking
mania
lasted
she
went
through
Mrs.
Cornelius
's
Receipt
*NL*
Book
as
if
it
were
a
mathematical
exercise
,
working
out
the
problems
*NL*
with
patience
and
care
.
Sometimes
her
family
were
invited
in
to
help
eat
*NL*
up
a
too
bounteous
feast
of
successes
,
or
Lotty
would
be
privately
*NL*
despatched
with
a
batch
of
failures
,
which
were
to
be
concealed
from
all
*NL*
eyes
in
the
convenient
stomachs
of
the
little
Hummels
.
An
evening
with
*NL*
John
over
the
account-books
usually
produced
a
temporary
lull
in
the
*NL*
culinary
enthusiasm
,
and
a
frugal
fit
would
ensue
,
during
which
the
poor
*NL*
man
was
put
through
a
course
of
bread-pudding
,
hash
,
and
warmed-over
*NL*
coffee
,
which
tried
his
soul
,
although
he
bore
it
with
praiseworthy
*NL*
fortitude
.
Before
the
golden
mean
was
found
,
however
,
Meg
added
to
her
*NL*
domestic
possessions
what
young
couples
seldom
get
on
long
without
,
--
a
*NL*
family
jar
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fired
with
a
housewifely
wish
to
see
her
store-room
stocked
with
*NL*
home-made
preserves
,
she
undertook
to
put
up
her
own
currant
jelly
.
John
*NL*
was
requested
to
order
home
a
dozen
or
so
of
little
pots
,
and
an
extra
*NL*
quantity
of
sugar
,
for
their
own
currants
were
ripe
,
and
were
to
be
*NL*
attended
to
at
once
.
As
John
firmly
believed
that
``
my
wife
''
was
equal
to
*NL*
anything
,
and
took
a
natural
pride
in
her
skill
,
he
resolved
that
she
*NL*
should
be
gratified
,
and
their
only
crop
of
fruit
laid
by
in
a
most
*NL*
pleasing
form
for
winter
use
.
Home
came
four
dozen
delightful
little
*NL*
pots
,
half
a
barrel
of
sugar
,
and
a
small
boy
to
pick
the
currants
for
*NL*
her
.
With
her
pretty
hair
tucked
into
a
little
cap
,
arms
bared
to
the
*NL*
elbow
,
and
a
checked
apron
which
had
a
coquettish
look
in
spite
of
the
*NL*
bib
,
the
young
housewife
fell
to
work
,
feeling
no
doubts
about
her
*NL*
success
;
for
had
n't
she
seen
Hannah
do
it
hundreds
of
times
?
The
array
*NL*
of
pots
rather
amazed
her
at
first
,
but
John
was
so
fond
of
jelly
,
and
*NL*
the
nice
little
jars
would
look
so
well
on
the
top
shelf
,
that
Meg
*NL*
resolved
to
fill
them
all
,
and
spent
a
long
day
picking
,
boiling
,
*NL*
straining
,
and
fussing
over
her
jelly
.
She
did
her
best
;
she
asked
*NL*
advice
of
Mrs.
Cornelius
;
she
racked
her
brain
to
remember
what
Hannah
*NL*
did
that
she
had
left
undone
;
she
reboiled
,
resugared
,
and
restrained
,
*NL*
but
that
dreadful
stuff
would
n't
''
_
jell
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
longed
to
run
home
,
bib
and
all
,
and
ask
mother
to
lend
a
hand
,
but
*NL*
John
and
she
had
agreed
that
they
would
never
annoy
any
one
with
their
*NL*
private
worries
,
experiments
,
or
quarrels
.
They
had
laughed
over
that
*NL*
last
word
as
if
the
idea
it
suggested
was
a
most
preposterous
one
;
but
*NL*
they
had
held
to
their
resolve
,
and
whenever
they
could
get
on
without
*NL*
help
they
did
so
,
and
no
one
interfered
,
for
Mrs.
March
had
advised
the
*NL*
plan
.
So
Meg
wrestled
alone
with
the
refractory
sweetmeats
all
that
hot
*NL*
summer
day
,
and
at
five
o'clock
sat
down
in
her
topsy-turvy
kitchen
,
*NL*
wrung
her
bedaubed
hands
,
lifted
up
her
voice
and
wept
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
in
the
first
flush
of
the
new
life
,
she
had
often
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
husband
shall
always
feel
free
to
bring
a
friend
home
whenever
he
*NL*
likes
.
I
shall
always
be
prepared
;
there
shall
be
no
flurry
,
no
*NL*
scolding
,
no
discomfort
,
but
a
neat
house
,
a
cheerful
wife
,
and
a
good
*NL*
dinner
.
John
,
dear
,
never
stop
to
ask
my
leave
,
invite
whom
you
please
,
*NL*
and
be
sure
of
a
welcome
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
How
charming
that
was
,
to
be
sure
!
John
quite
glowed
with
pride
to
hear
*NL*
her
say
it
,
and
felt
what
a
blessed
thing
it
was
to
have
a
superior
*NL*
wife
.
But
,
although
they
had
had
company
from
time
to
time
,
it
never
*NL*
happened
to
be
unexpected
,
and
Meg
had
never
had
an
opportunity
to
*NL*
distinguish
herself
till
now
.
It
always
happens
so
in
this
vale
of
*NL*
tears
;
there
is
an
inevitability
about
such
things
which
we
can
only
*NL*
wonder
at
,
deplore
,
and
bear
as
we
best
can
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
John
had
not
forgotten
all
about
the
jelly
,
it
really
would
have
been
*NL*
unpardonable
in
him
to
choose
that
day
,
of
all
the
days
in
the
year
,
to
*NL*
bring
a
friend
home
to
dinner
unexpectedly
.
Congratulating
himself
that
*NL*
a
handsome
repast
had
been
ordered
that
morning
,
feeling
sure
that
it
*NL*
would
be
ready
to
the
minute
,
and
indulging
in
pleasant
anticipations
of
*NL*
the
charming
effect
it
would
produce
,
when
his
pretty
wife
came
running
*NL*
out
to
meet
him
,
he
escorted
his
friend
to
his
mansion
,
with
the
*NL*
irrepressible
satisfaction
of
a
young
host
and
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
a
world
of
disappointments
,
as
John
discovered
when
he
reached
the
*NL*
Dove-cote
.
The
front
door
usually
stood
hospitably
open
;
now
it
was
not
*NL*
only
shut
,
but
locked
,
and
yesterday
's
mud
still
adorned
the
steps
.
The
*NL*
parlor-windows
were
closed
and
curtained
,
no
picture
of
the
pretty
wife
*NL*
sewing
on
the
piazza
,
in
white
,
with
a
distracting
little
bow
in
her
*NL*
hair
,
or
a
bright-eyed
hostess
,
smiling
a
shy
welcome
as
she
greeted
her
*NL*
guest
.
Nothing
of
the
sort
,
for
not
a
soul
appeared
,
but
a
*NL*
sanguinary-looking
boy
asleep
under
the
currant-bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
something
has
happened
.
Step
into
the
garden
,
Scott
,
while
I
*NL*
look
up
Mrs.
Brooke
,
''
said
John
,
alarmed
at
the
silence
and
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Round
the
house
he
hurried
,
led
by
a
pungent
smell
of
burnt
sugar
,
and
*NL*
Mr.
Scott
strolled
after
him
,
with
a
queer
look
on
his
face
.
He
paused
*NL*
discreetly
at
a
distance
when
Brooke
disappeared
;
but
he
could
both
see
*NL*
and
hear
,
and
,
being
a
bachelor
,
enjoyed
the
prospect
mightily
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
kitchen
reigned
confusion
and
despair
;
one
edition
of
jelly
was
*NL*
trickled
from
pot
to
pot
,
another
lay
upon
the
floor
,
and
a
third
was
*NL*
burning
gayly
on
the
stove
.
Lotty
,
with
Teutonic
phlegm
,
was
calmly
*NL*
eating
bread
and
currant
wine
,
for
the
jelly
was
still
in
a
hopelessly
*NL*
liquid
state
,
while
Mrs.
Brooke
,
with
her
apron
over
her
head
,
sat
*NL*
sobbing
dismally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
girl
,
what
is
the
matter
?
''
cried
John
,
rushing
in
,
with
*NL*
awful
visions
of
scalded
hands
,
sudden
news
of
affliction
,
and
secret
*NL*
consternation
at
the
thought
of
the
guest
in
the
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
John
,
I
_
am
_
so
tired
and
hot
and
cross
and
worried
!
I
've
been
at
it
*NL*
till
I
'm
all
worn
out
.
Do
come
and
help
me
or
I
_
shall
_
die
!
''
and
the
*NL*
exhausted
housewife
cast
herself
upon
his
breast
,
giving
him
a
sweet
*NL*
welcome
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
for
her
pinafore
had
been
baptized
*NL*
at
the
same
time
as
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
worries
you
,
dear
?
Has
anything
dreadful
happened
?
''
asked
the
*NL*
anxious
John
,
tenderly
kissing
the
crown
of
the
little
cap
,
which
was
*NL*
all
askew
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
sobbed
Meg
despairingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
quick
,
then
.
Do
n't
cry
,
I
can
bear
anything
better
than
that
.
*NL*
Out
with
it
,
love
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
--
the
jelly
wo
n't
jell
and
I
do
n't
know
what
to
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
Brooke
laughed
then
as
he
never
dared
to
laugh
afterward
;
and
the
*NL*
derisive
Scott
smiled
involuntarily
as
he
heard
the
hearty
peal
,
which
*NL*
put
the
finishing
stroke
to
poor
Meg
's
woe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
all
?
Fling
it
out
of
window
,
and
do
n't
bother
any
more
about
*NL*
it
.
I
'll
buy
you
quarts
if
you
want
it
;
but
for
heaven
's
sake
do
n't
have
*NL*
hysterics
,
for
I
've
brought
Jack
Scott
home
to
dinner
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
got
no
further
,
for
Meg
cast
him
off
,
and
clasped
her
hands
with
a
*NL*
tragic
gesture
as
she
fell
into
a
chair
,
exclaiming
in
a
tone
of
mingled
*NL*
indignation
,
reproach
,
and
dismay
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
to
dinner
,
and
everything
in
a
mess
!
John
Brooke
,
how
_
could
_
you
*NL*
do
such
a
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
,
he
's
in
the
garden
!
I
forgot
the
confounded
jelly
,
but
it
ca
n't
*NL*
be
helped
now
,
''
said
John
,
surveying
the
prospect
with
an
anxious
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
sent
word
,
or
told
me
this
morning
,
and
you
ought
to
*NL*
have
remembered
how
busy
I
was
,
''
continued
Meg
petulantly
;
for
even
*NL*
turtle-doves
will
peck
when
ruffled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
it
this
morning
,
and
there
was
no
time
to
send
word
,
for
*NL*
I
met
him
on
the
way
out
.
I
never
thought
of
asking
leave
,
when
you
have
*NL*
always
told
me
to
do
as
I
liked
.
I
never
tried
it
before
,
and
hang
me
if
*NL*
I
ever
do
again
!
''
added
John
,
with
an
aggrieved
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
hope
not
!
Take
him
away
at
once
;
I
ca
n't
see
him
,
and
there
*NL*
is
n't
any
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
like
that
!
Where
's
the
beef
and
vegetables
I
sent
home
,
and
the
*NL*
pudding
you
promised
?
''
cried
John
,
rushing
to
the
larder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
n't
time
to
cook
anything
;
I
meant
to
dine
at
mother
's
.
I
'm
sorry
,
*NL*
but
I
was
_
so
_
busy
;
''
and
Meg
's
tears
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
was
a
mild
man
,
but
he
was
human
;
and
after
a
long
day
's
work
,
to
*NL*
come
home
tired
,
hungry
,
and
hopeful
,
to
find
a
chaotic
house
,
an
empty
*NL*
table
,
and
a
cross
wife
was
not
exactly
conducive
to
repose
of
mind
or
*NL*
manner
.
He
restrained
himself
,
however
,
and
the
little
squall
would
have
*NL*
blown
over
,
but
for
one
unlucky
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
scrape
,
I
acknowledge
;
but
if
you
will
lend
a
hand
,
we
'll
pull
*NL*
through
,
and
have
a
good
time
yet
.
Do
n't
cry
,
dear
,
but
just
exert
*NL*
yourself
a
bit
,
and
knock
us
up
something
to
eat
.
We
're
both
as
hungry
*NL*
as
hunters
,
so
we
sha
'n'
t
mind
what
it
is
.
Give
us
the
cold
meat
,
and
*NL*
bread
and
cheese
;
we
wo
n't
ask
for
jelly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
meant
it
for
a
good-natured
joke
;
but
that
one
word
sealed
his
fate
.
*NL*
Meg
thought
it
was
_
too
_
cruel
to
hint
about
her
sad
failure
,
and
the
*NL*
last
atom
of
patience
vanished
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
get
yourself
out
of
the
scrape
as
you
can
;
I
'm
too
used
up
to
*NL*
`
exert
'
myself
for
any
one
.
It
's
like
a
man
to
propose
a
bone
and
vulgar
*NL*
bread
and
cheese
for
company
.
I
wo
n't
have
anything
of
the
sort
in
my
*NL*
house
.
Take
that
Scott
up
to
mother
's
,
and
tell
him
I
'm
away
,
sick
,
*NL*
dead
,
--
anything
.
I
wo
n't
see
him
,
and
you
two
can
laugh
at
me
and
my
*NL*
jelly
as
much
as
you
like
:
you
wo
n't
have
anything
else
here
;
''
and
*NL*
having
delivered
her
defiance
all
in
one
breath
,
Meg
cast
away
her
*NL*
pinafore
,
and
precipitately
left
the
field
to
bemoan
herself
in
her
own
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
those
two
creatures
did
in
her
absence
,
she
never
knew
;
but
Mr.
*NL*
Scott
was
not
taken
``
up
to
mother
's
,
''
and
when
Meg
descended
,
after
they
*NL*
had
strolled
away
together
,
she
found
traces
of
a
promiscuous
lunch
*NL*
which
filled
her
with
horror
.
Lotty
reported
that
they
had
eaten
``
a
*NL*
much
,
and
greatly
laughed
,
and
the
master
bid
her
throw
away
all
the
*NL*
sweet
stuff
,
and
hide
the
pots
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
longed
to
go
and
tell
mother
;
but
a
sense
of
shame
at
her
own
*NL*
short-comings
,
of
loyalty
to
John
,
``
who
might
be
cruel
,
but
nobody
*NL*
should
know
it
,
''
restrained
her
;
and
after
a
summary
clearing
up
,
she
*NL*
dressed
herself
prettily
,
and
sat
down
to
wait
for
John
to
come
and
be
*NL*
forgiven
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unfortunately
,
John
did
n't
come
,
not
seeing
the
matter
in
that
light
.
He
*NL*
had
carried
it
off
as
a
good
joke
with
Scott
,
excused
his
little
wife
as
*NL*
well
as
he
could
,
and
played
the
host
so
hospitably
that
his
friend
*NL*
enjoyed
the
impromptu
dinner
,
and
promised
to
come
again
.
But
John
was
*NL*
angry
,
though
he
did
not
show
it
;
he
felt
that
Meg
had
got
him
into
a
*NL*
scrape
,
and
then
deserted
him
in
his
hour
of
need
.
``
It
was
n't
fair
to
*NL*
tell
a
man
to
bring
folks
home
any
time
,
with
perfect
freedom
,
and
when
*NL*
he
took
you
at
your
word
,
to
flame
up
and
blame
him
,
and
leave
him
in
*NL*
the
lurch
,
to
be
laughed
at
or
pitied
.
No
,
by
George
,
it
was
n't
!
and
Meg
*NL*
must
know
it
.
''
He
had
fumed
inwardly
during
the
feast
,
but
when
the
*NL*
flurry
was
over
,
and
he
strolled
home
,
after
seeing
Scott
off
,
a
milder
*NL*
mood
came
over
him
.
``
Poor
little
thing
!
it
was
hard
upon
her
when
she
*NL*
tried
so
heartily
to
please
me
.
She
was
wrong
,
of
course
,
but
then
she
*NL*
was
young
.
I
must
be
patient
and
teach
her
.
''
He
hoped
she
had
not
gone
*NL*
home
--
he
hated
gossip
and
interference
.
For
a
minute
he
was
ruffled
*NL*
again
at
the
mere
thought
of
it
;
and
then
the
fear
that
Meg
would
cry
*NL*
herself
sick
softened
his
heart
,
and
sent
him
on
at
a
quicker
pace
,
*NL*
resolving
to
be
calm
and
kind
,
but
firm
,
quite
firm
,
and
show
her
where
*NL*
she
had
failed
in
her
duty
to
her
spouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
likewise
resolved
to
be
``
calm
and
kind
,
but
firm
,
''
and
show
_
him
_
*NL*
his
duty
.
She
longed
to
run
to
meet
him
,
and
beg
pardon
,
and
be
kissed
*NL*
and
comforted
,
as
she
was
sure
of
being
;
but
,
of
course
,
she
did
nothing
*NL*
of
the
sort
,
and
when
she
saw
John
coming
,
began
to
hum
quite
naturally
,
*NL*
as
she
rocked
and
sewed
,
like
a
lady
of
leisure
in
her
best
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
was
a
little
disappointed
not
to
find
a
tender
Niobe
;
but
,
feeling
*NL*
that
his
dignity
demanded
the
first
apology
,
he
made
none
,
only
came
*NL*
leisurely
in
,
and
laid
himself
upon
the
sofa
,
with
the
singularly
*NL*
relevant
remark
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
going
to
have
a
new
moon
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
objection
,
''
was
Meg
's
equally
soothing
remark
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
other
topics
of
general
interest
were
introduced
by
Mr.
Brooke
,
*NL*
and
wet-blanketed
by
Mrs.
Brooke
,
and
conversation
languished
.
John
went
*NL*
to
one
window
,
unfolded
his
paper
,
and
wrapped
himself
in
it
,
*NL*
figuratively
speaking
.
Meg
went
to
the
other
window
,
and
sewed
as
if
new
*NL*
rosettes
for
her
slippers
were
among
the
necessaries
of
life
.
Neither
*NL*
spoke
;
both
looked
quite
``
calm
and
firm
,
''
and
both
felt
desperately
*NL*
uncomfortable
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
''
thought
Meg
,
``
married
life
is
very
trying
,
and
does
need
*NL*
infinite
patience
,
as
well
as
love
,
as
mother
says
.
''
The
word
``
mother
''
*NL*
suggested
other
maternal
counsels
,
given
long
ago
,
and
received
with
*NL*
unbelieving
protests
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
is
a
good
man
,
but
he
has
his
faults
,
and
you
must
learn
to
see
*NL*
and
bear
with
them
,
remembering
your
own
.
He
is
very
decided
,
but
never
*NL*
will
be
obstinate
,
if
you
reason
kindly
,
not
oppose
impatiently
.
He
is
*NL*
very
accurate
,
and
particular
about
the
truth
--
a
good
trait
,
though
you
*NL*
call
him
`
fussy
.
'
Never
deceive
him
by
look
or
word
,
Meg
,
and
he
will
*NL*
give
you
the
confidence
you
deserve
,
the
support
you
need
.
He
has
a
*NL*
temper
,
not
like
ours
,
--
one
flash
,
and
then
all
over
,
--
but
the
white
,
*NL*
still
anger
,
that
is
seldom
stirred
,
but
once
kindled
,
is
hard
to
*NL*
quench
.
Be
careful
,
very
careful
,
not
to
wake
this
anger
against
*NL*
yourself
,
for
peace
and
happiness
depend
on
keeping
his
respect
.
Watch
*NL*
yourself
,
be
the
first
to
ask
pardon
if
you
both
err
,
and
guard
against
*NL*
the
little
piques
,
misunderstandings
,
and
hasty
words
that
often
pave
*NL*
the
way
for
bitter
sorrow
and
regret
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
words
came
back
to
Meg
,
as
she
sat
sewing
in
the
sunset
,
*NL*
especially
the
last
.
This
was
the
first
serious
disagreement
;
her
own
*NL*
hasty
speeches
sounded
both
silly
and
unkind
,
as
she
recalled
them
,
her
*NL*
own
anger
looked
childish
now
,
and
thoughts
of
poor
John
coming
home
to
*NL*
such
a
scene
quite
melted
her
heart
.
She
glanced
at
him
with
tears
in
*NL*
her
eyes
,
but
he
did
not
see
them
;
she
put
down
her
work
and
got
up
,
*NL*
thinking
,
``
I
_
will
_
be
the
first
to
say
,
`
Forgive
me
,
'
''
but
he
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
hear
her
;
she
went
very
slowly
across
the
room
,
for
pride
was
*NL*
hard
to
swallow
,
and
stood
by
him
,
but
he
did
not
turn
his
head
.
For
a
*NL*
minute
she
felt
as
if
she
really
could
n't
do
it
;
then
came
the
thought
,
*NL*
``
This
is
the
beginning
,
I
'll
do
my
part
,
and
have
nothing
to
reproach
*NL*
myself
with
,
''
and
stooping
down
,
she
softly
kissed
her
husband
on
the
*NL*
forehead
.
Of
course
that
settled
it
;
the
penitent
kiss
was
better
than
a
*NL*
world
of
words
,
and
John
had
her
on
his
knee
in
a
minute
,
saying
*NL*
tenderly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
too
bad
to
laugh
at
the
poor
little
jelly-pots
.
Forgive
me
,
*NL*
dear
,
I
never
will
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
,
oh
bless
you
,
yes
,
hundreds
of
times
,
and
so
did
Meg
,
both
*NL*
declaring
that
it
was
the
sweetest
jelly
they
ever
made
;
for
family
*NL*
peace
was
preserved
in
that
little
family
jar
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
Meg
had
Mr.
Scott
to
dinner
by
special
invitation
,
and
*NL*
served
him
up
a
pleasant
feast
without
a
cooked
wife
for
the
first
*NL*
course
;
on
which
occasion
she
was
so
gay
and
gracious
,
and
made
*NL*
everything
go
off
so
charmingly
,
that
Mr.
Scott
told
John
he
was
a
happy
*NL*
fellow
,
and
shook
his
head
over
the
hardships
of
bachelorhood
all
the
*NL*
way
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
autumn
,
new
trials
and
experiences
came
to
Meg
.
Sallie
Moffat
*NL*
renewed
her
friendship
,
was
always
running
out
for
a
dish
of
gossip
at
*NL*
the
little
house
,
or
inviting
``
that
poor
dear
''
to
come
in
and
spend
the
*NL*
day
at
the
big
house
.
It
was
pleasant
,
for
in
dull
weather
Meg
often
*NL*
felt
lonely
;
all
were
busy
at
home
,
John
absent
till
night
,
and
nothing
*NL*
to
do
but
sew
,
or
read
,
or
potter
about
.
So
it
naturally
fell
out
that
*NL*
Meg
got
into
the
way
of
gadding
and
gossiping
with
her
friend
.
Seeing
*NL*
Sallie
's
pretty
things
made
her
long
for
such
,
and
pity
herself
because
*NL*
she
had
not
got
them
.
Sallie
was
very
kind
,
and
often
offered
her
the
*NL*
coveted
trifles
;
but
Meg
declined
them
,
knowing
that
John
would
n't
like
*NL*
it
;
and
then
this
foolish
little
woman
went
and
did
what
John
disliked
*NL*
infinitely
worse
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
her
husband
's
income
,
and
she
loved
to
feel
that
he
trusted
*NL*
her
,
not
only
with
his
happiness
,
but
what
some
men
seem
to
value
*NL*
more
,
--
his
money
.
She
knew
where
it
was
,
was
free
to
take
what
she
*NL*
liked
,
and
all
he
asked
was
that
she
should
keep
account
of
every
penny
,
*NL*
pay
bills
once
a
month
,
and
remember
that
she
was
a
poor
man
's
wife
.
*NL*
Till
now
,
she
had
done
well
,
been
prudent
and
exact
,
kept
her
little
*NL*
account-books
neatly
,
and
showed
them
to
him
monthly
without
fear
.
But
*NL*
that
autumn
the
serpent
got
into
Meg
's
paradise
,
and
tempted
her
,
like
*NL*
many
a
modern
Eve
,
not
with
apples
,
but
with
dress
.
Meg
did
n't
like
to
*NL*
be
pitied
and
made
to
feel
poor
;
it
irritated
her
,
but
she
was
ashamed
*NL*
to
confess
it
,
and
now
and
then
she
tried
to
console
herself
by
buying
*NL*
something
pretty
,
so
that
Sallie
need
n't
think
she
had
to
economize
.
She
*NL*
always
felt
wicked
after
it
,
for
the
pretty
things
were
seldom
*NL*
necessaries
;
but
then
they
cost
so
little
,
it
was
n't
worth
worrying
*NL*
about
;
so
the
trifles
increased
unconsciously
,
and
in
the
shopping
*NL*
excursions
she
was
no
longer
a
passive
looker-on
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
trifles
cost
more
than
one
would
imagine
;
and
when
she
cast
up
*NL*
her
accounts
at
the
end
of
the
month
,
the
sum
total
rather
scared
her
.
*NL*
John
was
busy
that
month
,
and
left
the
bills
to
her
;
the
next
month
he
*NL*
was
absent
;
but
the
third
he
had
a
grand
quarterly
settling
up
,
and
Meg
*NL*
never
forgot
it
.
A
few
days
before
she
had
done
a
dreadful
thing
,
and
it
*NL*
weighed
upon
her
conscience
.
Sallie
had
been
buying
silks
,
and
Meg
*NL*
longed
for
a
new
one
,
--
just
a
handsome
light
one
for
parties
,
her
black
*NL*
silk
was
so
common
,
and
thin
things
for
evening
wear
were
only
proper
*NL*
for
girls
.
Aunt
March
usually
gave
the
sisters
a
present
of
twenty-five
*NL*
dollars
apiece
at
New
Year
;
that
was
only
a
month
to
wait
,
and
here
was
*NL*
a
lovely
violet
silk
going
at
a
bargain
,
and
she
had
the
money
,
if
she
*NL*
only
dared
to
take
it
.
John
always
said
what
was
his
was
hers
;
but
would
*NL*
he
think
it
right
to
spend
not
only
the
prospective
five-and-twenty
,
but
*NL*
another
five-and-twenty
out
of
the
household
fund
?
That
was
the
*NL*
question
.
Sallie
had
urged
her
to
do
it
,
had
offered
to
loan
the
money
,
*NL*
and
with
the
best
intentions
in
life
,
had
tempted
Meg
beyond
her
*NL*
strength
.
In
an
evil
moment
the
shopman
held
up
the
lovely
,
shimmering
*NL*
folds
,
and
said
,
``
A
bargain
,
I
assure
you
,
ma'am
.
''
She
answered
,
``
I
'll
*NL*
take
it
;
''
and
it
was
cut
off
and
paid
for
,
and
Sallie
had
exulted
,
and
*NL*
she
had
laughed
as
if
it
were
a
thing
of
no
consequence
,
and
driven
*NL*
away
,
feeling
as
if
she
had
stolen
something
,
and
the
police
were
after
*NL*
her
.

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
got
home
,
she
tried
to
assuage
the
pangs
of
remorse
by
*NL*
spreading
forth
the
lovely
silk
;
but
it
looked
less
silvery
now
,
did
n't
*NL*
become
her
,
after
all
,
and
the
words
``
fifty
dollars
''
seemed
stamped
like
*NL*
a
pattern
down
each
breadth
.
She
put
it
away
;
but
it
haunted
her
,
not
*NL*
delightfully
,
as
a
new
dress
should
,
but
dreadfully
,
like
the
ghost
of
a
*NL*
folly
that
was
not
easily
laid
.
When
John
got
out
his
books
that
night
,
*NL*
Meg
's
heart
sank
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
her
married
life
,
she
was
*NL*
afraid
of
her
husband
.
The
kind
,
brown
eyes
looked
as
if
they
could
be
*NL*
stern
;
and
though
he
was
unusually
merry
,
she
fancied
he
had
found
her
*NL*
out
,
but
did
n't
mean
to
let
her
know
it
.
The
house-bills
were
all
paid
,
*NL*
the
books
all
in
order
.
John
had
praised
her
,
and
was
undoing
the
old
*NL*
pocket-book
which
they
called
the
``
bank
,
''
when
Meg
,
knowing
that
it
was
*NL*
quite
empty
,
stopped
his
hand
,
saying
nervously
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
n't
seen
my
private
expense
book
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
never
asked
to
see
it
;
but
she
always
insisted
on
his
doing
so
,
and
*NL*
used
to
enjoy
his
masculine
amazement
at
the
queer
things
women
wanted
,
*NL*
and
made
him
guess
what
``
piping
''
was
,
demand
fiercely
the
meaning
of
a
*NL*
``
hug-me-tight
,
''
or
wonder
how
a
little
thing
composed
of
three
rosebuds
,
*NL*
a
bit
of
velvet
,
and
a
pair
of
strings
,
could
possibly
be
a
bonnet
,
and
*NL*
cost
five
or
six
dollars
.
That
night
he
looked
as
if
he
would
like
the
*NL*
fun
of
quizzing
her
figures
and
pretending
to
be
horrified
at
her
*NL*
extravagance
,
as
he
often
did
,
being
particularly
proud
of
his
prudent
*NL*
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
book
was
brought
slowly
out
,
and
laid
down
before
him
.
Meg
*NL*
got
behind
his
chair
under
pretence
of
smoothing
the
wrinkles
out
of
his
*NL*
tired
forehead
,
and
standing
there
,
she
said
,
with
her
panic
increasing
*NL*
with
every
word
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
John
,
dear
,
I
'm
ashamed
to
show
you
my
book
,
for
I
've
really
been
*NL*
dreadfully
extravagant
lately
.
I
go
about
so
much
I
must
have
things
,
*NL*
you
know
,
and
Sallie
advised
my
getting
it
,
so
I
did
;
and
my
New-Year
's
*NL*
money
will
partly
pay
for
it
:
but
I
was
sorry
after
I
'd
done
it
,
for
I
*NL*
knew
you
'd
think
it
wrong
in
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
laughed
,
and
drew
her
round
beside
him
,
saying
good-humoredly
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
and
hide
.
I
wo
n't
beat
you
if
you
_
have
_
got
a
pair
of
killing
*NL*
boots
;
I
'm
rather
proud
of
my
wife
's
feet
,
and
do
n't
mind
if
she
does
*NL*
pay
eight
or
nine
dollars
for
her
boots
,
if
they
are
good
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
had
been
one
of
her
last
``
trifles
,
''
and
John
's
eye
had
fallen
on
it
*NL*
as
he
spoke
.
``
Oh
,
what
_
will
_
he
say
when
he
comes
to
that
awful
fifty
*NL*
dollars
!
''
thought
Meg
,
with
a
shiver
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
worse
than
boots
,
it
's
a
silk
dress
,
''
she
said
,
with
the
calmness
*NL*
of
desperation
,
for
she
wanted
the
worst
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
dear
,
what
is
the
`
dem
'd
total
,
'
as
Mr.
Mantalini
says
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
did
n't
sound
like
John
,
and
she
knew
he
was
looking
up
at
her
with
*NL*
the
straightforward
look
that
she
had
always
been
ready
to
meet
and
*NL*
answer
with
one
as
frank
till
now
.
She
turned
the
page
and
her
head
at
*NL*
the
same
time
,
pointing
to
the
sum
which
would
have
been
bad
enough
*NL*
without
the
fifty
,
but
which
was
appalling
to
her
with
that
added
.
For
a
*NL*
minute
the
room
was
very
still
;
then
John
said
slowly
,
--
but
she
could
*NL*
feel
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
express
no
displeasure
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
that
fifty
is
much
for
a
dress
,
with
all
the
*NL*
furbelows
and
notions
you
have
to
have
to
finish
it
off
these
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
made
or
trimmed
,
''
sighed
Meg
faintly
,
for
a
sudden
*NL*
recollection
of
the
cost
still
to
be
incurred
quite
overwhelmed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
yards
of
silk
seems
a
good
deal
to
cover
one
small
woman
,
*NL*
but
I
've
no
doubt
my
wife
will
look
as
fine
as
Ned
Moffat
's
when
she
*NL*
gets
it
on
,
''
said
John
dryly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
are
angry
,
John
,
but
I
ca
n't
help
it
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
waste
*NL*
your
money
,
and
I
did
n't
think
those
little
things
would
count
up
so
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
resist
them
when
I
see
Sallie
buying
all
she
wants
,
and
pitying
me
*NL*
because
I
do
n't
.
I
try
to
be
contented
,
but
it
is
hard
,
and
I
'm
tired
of
*NL*
being
poor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
words
were
spoken
so
low
she
thought
he
did
not
hear
them
,
but
*NL*
he
did
,
and
they
wounded
him
deeply
,
for
he
had
denied
himself
many
*NL*
pleasures
for
Meg
's
sake
.
She
could
have
bitten
her
tongue
out
the
*NL*
minute
she
had
said
it
,
for
John
pushed
the
books
away
,
and
got
up
,
*NL*
saying
,
with
a
little
quiver
in
his
voice
,
``
I
was
afraid
of
this
;
I
do
*NL*
my
best
,
Meg
.
''
If
he
had
scolded
her
,
or
even
shaken
her
,
it
would
not
*NL*
have
broken
her
heart
like
those
few
words
.
She
ran
to
him
and
held
him
*NL*
close
,
crying
,
with
repentant
tears
,
``
O
John
,
my
dear
,
kind
,
*NL*
hard-working
boy
,
I
did
n't
mean
it
!
It
was
so
wicked
,
so
untrue
and
*NL*
ungrateful
,
how
could
I
say
it
!
Oh
,
how
could
I
say
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
very
kind
,
forgave
her
readily
,
and
did
not
utter
one
reproach
;
*NL*
but
Meg
knew
that
she
had
done
and
said
a
thing
which
would
not
be
*NL*
forgotten
soon
,
although
he
might
never
allude
to
it
again
.
She
had
*NL*
promised
to
love
him
for
better
for
worse
;
and
then
she
,
his
wife
,
had
*NL*
reproached
him
with
his
poverty
,
after
spending
his
earnings
recklessly
.
*NL*
It
was
dreadful
;
and
the
worst
of
it
was
John
went
on
so
quietly
*NL*
afterward
,
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
,
except
that
he
stayed
in
*NL*
town
later
,
and
worked
at
night
when
she
had
gone
to
cry
herself
to
*NL*
sleep
.
A
week
of
remorse
nearly
made
Meg
sick
;
and
the
discovery
that
*NL*
John
had
countermanded
the
order
for
his
new
great-coat
reduced
her
to
a
*NL*
state
of
despair
which
was
pathetic
to
behold
.
He
had
simply
said
,
in
*NL*
answer
to
her
surprised
inquiries
as
to
the
change
,
``
I
ca
n't
afford
it
,
*NL*
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
said
no
more
,
but
a
few
minutes
after
he
found
her
in
the
hall
,
with
*NL*
her
face
buried
in
the
old
great-coat
,
crying
as
if
her
heart
would
*NL*
break
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
long
talk
that
night
,
and
Meg
learned
to
love
her
husband
*NL*
better
for
his
poverty
,
because
it
seemed
to
have
made
a
man
of
him
,
*NL*
given
him
the
strength
and
courage
to
fight
his
own
way
,
and
taught
him
*NL*
a
tender
patience
with
which
to
bear
and
comfort
the
natural
longings
*NL*
and
failures
of
those
he
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
she
put
her
pride
in
her
pocket
,
went
to
Sallie
,
told
the
*NL*
truth
,
and
asked
her
to
buy
the
silk
as
a
favor
.
The
good-natured
Mrs.
*NL*
Moffat
willingly
did
so
,
and
had
the
delicacy
not
to
make
her
a
present
*NL*
of
it
immediately
afterward
.
Then
Meg
ordered
home
the
great-coat
,
and
,
*NL*
when
John
arrived
,
she
put
it
on
,
and
asked
him
how
he
liked
her
new
*NL*
silk
gown
.
One
can
imagine
what
answer
he
made
,
how
he
received
his
*NL*
present
,
and
what
a
blissful
state
of
things
ensued
.
John
came
home
*NL*
early
,
Meg
gadded
no
more
;
and
that
great-coat
was
put
on
in
the
morning
*NL*
by
a
very
happy
husband
,
and
taken
off
at
night
by
a
most
devoted
little
*NL*
wife
.
So
the
year
rolled
round
,
and
at
midsummer
there
came
to
Meg
a
new
*NL*
experience
,
--
the
deepest
and
tenderest
of
a
woman
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
came
sneaking
into
the
kitchen
of
the
Dove-cote
,
one
Saturday
,
*NL*
with
an
excited
face
,
and
was
received
with
the
clash
of
cymbals
;
for
*NL*
Hannah
clapped
her
hands
with
a
saucepan
in
one
and
the
cover
in
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
the
little
mamma
?
Where
is
everybody
?
Why
did
n't
you
tell
me
*NL*
before
I
came
home
?
''
began
Laurie
,
in
a
loud
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Happy
as
a
queen
,
the
dear
!
Every
soul
of
'em
is
upstairs
a
worshipin
'
;
*NL*
we
did
n't
want
no
hurrycanes
round
.
Now
you
go
into
the
parlor
,
and
I
'll
*NL*
send
'em
down
to
you
,
''
with
which
somewhat
involved
reply
Hannah
*NL*
vanished
,
chuckling
ecstatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
Jo
appeared
,
proudly
bearing
a
flannel
bundle
laid
forth
upon
*NL*
a
large
pillow
.
Jo
's
face
was
very
sober
,
but
her
eyes
twinkled
,
and
*NL*
there
was
an
odd
sound
in
her
voice
of
repressed
emotion
of
some
sort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
your
eyes
and
hold
out
your
arms
,
''
she
said
invitingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
backed
precipitately
into
a
corner
,
and
put
his
hands
behind
him
*NL*
with
an
imploring
gesture
:
``
No
,
thank
you
,
I
'd
rather
not
.
I
shall
drop
*NL*
it
or
smash
it
,
as
sure
as
fate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
sha
'n'
t
see
your
nevvy
,
''
said
Jo
decidedly
,
turning
as
if
to
*NL*
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
I
will
!
only
you
must
be
responsible
for
damages
;
''
and
,
obeying
*NL*
orders
,
Laurie
heroically
shut
his
eyes
while
something
was
put
into
his
*NL*
arms
.
A
peal
of
laughter
from
Jo
,
Amy
,
Mrs.
March
,
Hannah
,
and
John
*NL*
caused
him
to
open
them
the
next
minute
,
to
find
himself
invested
with
*NL*
two
babies
instead
of
one
.

*NL*
*NL*
No
wonder
they
laughed
,
for
the
expression
of
his
face
was
droll
enough
*NL*
to
convulse
a
Quaker
,
as
he
stood
and
stared
wildly
from
the
unconscious
*NL*
innocents
to
the
hilarious
spectators
,
with
such
dismay
that
Jo
sat
down
*NL*
on
the
floor
and
screamed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twins
,
by
Jupiter
!
''
was
all
he
said
for
a
minute
;
then
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
women
with
an
appealing
look
that
was
comically
piteous
,
he
added
,
``
Take
*NL*
'em
quick
,
somebody
!
I
'm
going
to
laugh
,
and
I
shall
drop
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
rescued
his
babies
,
and
marched
up
and
down
,
with
one
on
each
arm
,
*NL*
as
if
already
initiated
into
the
mysteries
of
baby-tending
,
while
Laurie
*NL*
laughed
till
the
tears
ran
down
his
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
best
joke
of
the
season
,
is
n't
it
?
I
would
n't
have
you
told

*NL*
for
I
set
my
heart
on
surprising
you
,
and
I
flatter
myself
I
've
done
*NL*
it

said
Jo
,
when
she
got
her
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
was
more
staggered
in
my
life

Is
n't
it
fun

Are

*NL*
What
are
you
going
to

them

Let

have
another

Hold

up

*NL*
Jo

for
upon
my
life
it
's
one
too
many
for

''
returned
Laurie
,
*NL*
regarding
the
infants
with
the
air
of
a
big
,
benevolent
Newfoundland
*NL*
looking
at
a
pair
of
infantile
kittens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Boy

Are

said
the
proud
papa
,
beaming
upon
*NL*
the
little
,
red
squirmers
as
if
they
were
unfledged
angels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
remarkable
children
I
ever
saw

Which
is

?

and
Laurie
bent
*NL*
like
a
well-sweep
to
examine
the
prodigies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amy
put
a
blue
ribbon
on
the

on

can
always

said
wicked
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
they
might
n't
like
it

began
Laurie
,
with
unusual
timidity
*NL*
in
such
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

they
will

they
are
used

it
now

Do
it
this

*NL*
commanded
Jo
,
fearing
he
might
propose
a
proxy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
screwed
up
his
face
,
and
obeyed
with
a
gingerly
peck
at
each
*NL*
little
cheek
that
produced
another
laugh
,
and
made
the
babies
squeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
Laurie
,
delighted
with
a
*NL*
poke
in
the
face
from
a
tiny
fist
,
flapping
aimlessly
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

clapping

At
that
minute
Jo
was
particularly
absorbed
in
dressmaking
;
for
she
was
*NL*
mantua-maker
general
to
the
family
,
and
took
especial
credit
to
herself
*NL*
because
she
could
use
a
needle
as
well
as
a
pen

It
was
very
provoking
*NL*
to
be
arrested
in
the
act

a
first
trying-on
,
and
ordered
out
to
make
*NL*
calls
in
her
best
array
,
on
a
warm
July
day

She
hated
calls
of
the
*NL*
formal
sort
,
and
never
made
any

Amy
compelled
her
with
a
bargain
,
*NL*
bribe

promise

In
the
present
instance

there
was
no
escape

*NL*
having
clashed
her
scissors
rebelliously
,
while
protesting
that
she
*NL*
smelt
thunder
,
she
gave
in
,
put
away
her
work
,
and
taking
up
her
hat
and
*NL*
gloves
with
an
air
of
resignation
,
told
Amy
the
victim
was
ready
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

amazement

*NL*
``

for
my
clothes
than
they
do
for
*NL*
me
,
I
do
n't
wish
to
see
them
.
You
can
dress
for
both
,
and
be
as
elegant
*NL*
as
you
please
:
it
pays
for
you
to
be
fine
;
it
does
n't
for
me
,
and
*NL*
furbelows
only
worry
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
!
''
sighed
Amy
;
``
now
she
's
in
a
contrary
fit
,
and
will
drive
me
*NL*
distracted
before
I
can
get
her
properly
ready
.
I
'm
sure
it
's
no
*NL*
pleasure
to
me
to
go
to-day
,
but
it
's
a
debt
we
owe
society
,
and
there
's
*NL*
no
one
to
pay
it
but
you
and
me
.
I
'll
do
anything
for
you
,
Jo
,
if
you
'll
*NL*
only
dress
yourself
nicely
,
and
come
and
help
me
do
the
civil
.
You
can
*NL*
talk
so
well
,
look
so
aristocratic
in
your
best
things
,
and
behave
so
*NL*
beautifully
,
if
you
try
,
that
I
'm
proud
of
you

I
'm
afraid

go
alone

come

take
care
of
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
an
artful
little
puss
to
flatter
and
wheedle
your
cross
old
*NL*
sister
in
that
way
.
The
idea
of
my
being
aristocratic
and
well-bred
,
and
*NL*
your
being
afraid
to
go
anywhere
alone
!
I
do
n't
know
which
is
the
most
*NL*
absurd
.
Well
,
I
'll
go
if
I
must
,
and
do
my
best
.
You
shall
be
commander
*NL*
of
the
expedition
,
and
I
'll
obey
blindly
;
will
that
satisfy
you
?
''
said
*NL*
Jo
,
with
a
sudden
change
from
perversity
to
lamb-like
submission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
perfect
cherub
!
Now
put
on
all
your
best
things
,
and
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
how
to
behave
at
each
place
,
so
that
you
will
make
a
good
*NL*
impression
.
I
want
people
to
like
you
,
and
they
would
if
you
'd
only
try
*NL*
to
be
a
little
more
agreeable
.
Do
your
hair
the
pretty
way
,
and
put
the
*NL*
pink
rose
in
your
bonnet
;
it
's
becoming
,
and
you
look
too
sober
in
your
*NL*
plain
suit
.
Take
your
light
gloves
and
the
embroidered
handkerchief
.
*NL*
We
'll
stop
at
Meg
's
,
and
borrow
her
white
sunshade
,
and
then
you
can
*NL*
have
my
dove-colored
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Amy
dressed
,
she
issued
her
orders
,
and
Jo
obeyed
them
;
not
*NL*
without
entering
her
protest
,
however
,
for
she
sighed
as
she
rustled
*NL*
into
her
new
organdie
,
frowned
darkly
at
herself
as
she
tied
her
bonnet
*NL*
strings
in
an
irreproachable
bow
,
wrestled
viciously
with
pins
as
she
*NL*
put
on
her
collar
,
wrinkled
up
her
features
generally
as
she
shook
out
*NL*
the
handkerchief
,
whose
embroidery
was
as
irritating
to
her
nose
as
the
*NL*
present
mission
was
to
her
feelings
;
and
when
she
had
squeezed
her
hands
*NL*
into
tight
gloves
with
three
buttons
and
a
tassel
,
as
the
last
touch
of
*NL*
elegance
,
she
turned
to
Amy
with
an
imbecile
expression
of
countenance
,
*NL*
saying
meekly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
perfectly
miserable
;
but
if
you
consider
me
presentable
,
I
die
*NL*
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
highly
satisfactory
;
turn
slowly
round
,
and
let
me
get
a
*NL*
careful
view
.
''
Jo
revolved
,
and
Amy
gave
a
touch
here
and
there
,
then
*NL*
fell
back
,
with
her
head
on
one
side
,
observing
graciously
,
``
Yes
,
you
'll
*NL*
do
;
your
head
is
all
I
could
ask
,
for
that
white
bonnet

with
_
the
rose
*NL*
is
quite
ravishing
.
Hold
back
your
shoulders
,
and
carry
your
hands
*NL*
easily
,
no
matter
if
your
gloves
do
pinch
.
There
's
one
thing
you
can
do
*NL*
well
,
Jo
,
that
is
,
wear
a
shawl

I
ca
n't
;
but
it
's
very
nice
to
see
you
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
so
glad
Aunt
March
gave
you
that
lovely
one
;
it
's
simple
,
but
*NL*
handsome
,
and
those
folds
over
the
arm
are
really
artistic
.
Is
the
point
*NL*
of
my
mantle
in
the
middle
,
and
have
I
looped
my
dress
evenly
?
I
like
to
*NL*
show
my
boots

my
feet

are

pretty

my
nose
is
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
thing
of
beauty
and
a
joy
forever
,
''
said
Jo
,
looking
through
*NL*
her
hand
with
the
air
of
a
connoisseur
at
the
blue
feather
against
the
*NL*
gold
hair
.
``
Am
I
to
drag
my
best
dress
through
the
dust
,
or
loop
it
up
,
*NL*
please
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
it
up
when
you
walk
,
but
drop
it
in
the
house
;
the
sweeping
style
*NL*
suits
you
best
,
and
you
must
learn
to
trail
your
skirts
gracefully
.
You
*NL*
have
n't
half
buttoned
one
cuff
;
do
it
at
once

You
'll
never
look
*NL*
finished
if
you
are
not
careful
about
the
little
details
,
for
they
make
*NL*
up
the
pleasing
whole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
sighed
,
and
proceeded
to
burst
the
buttons
off
her
glove
,
in
doing
up
*NL*
her
cuff
;
but
at
last
both
were
ready
,
and
sailed
away
,
looking
as
*NL*
``
pretty
as
picters
,
''
Hannah
said
,
as
she
hung
out
of
the
upper
window
to
*NL*
watch
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jo
dear
,
the
Chesters
consider
themselves
very
elegant
people

so
*NL*
I
want
you
to
put
on
your
best
deportment

Do
n't
make
any
of
your
abrupt
*NL*
remarks
,
or
do
anything
odd
,
will
you
?
Just
be
calm
,
cool
,
and
*NL*
quiet
,

that
's
safe
and
ladylike
;
and
you
can
easily
do
it
for
fifteen
*NL*
minutes

said
Amy
,
as
they
approached
the
first
place
,
having
borrowed
*NL*
the
white
parasol
and
been
inspected
by
Meg
,
with
a
baby
on
each
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
see
.
`
Calm
,
cool
,
and
quiet
,
'
--
yes
,
I
think
I
can
promise
that
.
*NL*
I
've
played
the
part
of
a
prim
young
lady
on
the
stage
,
and
I
'll
try
it
*NL*
off
.
My
powers
are
great
,
as
you
shall
see
;
so
be
easy
in
your
mind
,
my
*NL*
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
looked
relieved
,
but
naughty
Jo
took
her
at
her
word
;
for
,
during
*NL*
the
first
call
,
she
sat
with
every
limb
gracefully
composed
,
every
fold
*NL*
correctly
draped
,
calm
as
a
summer
sea
,
cool
as
a
snowbank
,
and
as
*NL*
silent
as
a
sphinx
.
In
vain
Mrs.
Chester
alluded
to
her
``
charming
*NL*
novel
,
''
and
the
Misses
Chester
introduced
parties
,
picnics
,
the
opera
,
*NL*
and
the
fashions
;
each
and
all
were
answered
by
a
smile
,
a
bow
,
and
a
*NL*
demure
``
Yes
''
or
``
No
,
''
with
the
chill
on
.
In
vain
Amy
telegraphed
the
*NL*
word
``
Talk
,
''
tried
to
draw
her
out
,
and
administered
covert
pokes
with
*NL*
her
foot
.
Jo
sat
as
if
blandly
unconscious
of
it
all
,
with
deportment
*NL*
like
Maud
's
face
,
``
icily
regular
,
splendidly
null
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
haughty
,
uninteresting
creature
that
oldest
Miss
March
is
!
''
was
*NL*
the
unfortunately
audible
remark
of
one
of
the
ladies
,
as
the
door
*NL*
closed
upon
their
guests
.
Jo
laughed
noiselessly
all
through
the
hall
,
*NL*
but
Amy
looked
disgusted
at
the
failure
of
her
instructions
,
and
very
*NL*
naturally
laid
the
blame
upon
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
you
mistake
me
so
?
I
merely
meant
you
to
be
properly
*NL*
dignified
and
composed
,
and
you
made
yourself
a
perfect
stock
and
*NL*
stone
.
Try
to
be
sociable
at
the
Lambs
'
,
gossip
as
other
girls
do
,
and
*NL*
be
interested
in
dress
and
flirtations
and
whatever
nonsense
comes
up
.
*NL*
They
move
in
the
best
society
,
are
valuable
persons
for
us
to
know
,
and
*NL*
I
would
n't
fail
to
make
a
good
impression
there
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
agreeable
;
I
'll
gossip
and
giggle
,
and
have
horrors
and
*NL*
raptures
over
any
trifle
you
like
.
I
rather
enjoy
this
,
and
now
I
'll
*NL*
imitate
what
is
called

a
charming
girl
;
'
I
can
do
it
,
for
I
have
May
*NL*
Chester
as
a
model
,
and
I
'll
improve
upon
her
.
See
if
the
Lambs
do
n't
*NL*
say
,
`
What
a
lively
,
nice
creature
that
Jo
March
is
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
felt
anxious
,
as
well
she
might
,
for
when
Jo
turned
freakish
there
*NL*
was
no
knowing
where
she
would
stop
.
Amy
's
face
was
a
study
when
she
saw
*NL*
her
sister
skim
into
the
next
drawing-room
,
kiss
all
the
young
ladies
*NL*
with
effusion
,
beam
graciously
upon
the
young
gentlemen
,
and
join
in
the
*NL*
chat
with
a
spirit
which
amazed
the
beholder
.
Amy
was
taken
possession
*NL*
of
by
Mrs.
Lamb
,
with
whom
she
was
a
favorite
,
and
forced
to
hear
a
long
*NL*
account
of
Lucretia
's
last
attack
,
while
three
delightful
young
*NL*
gentlemen
hovered
near
,
waiting
for
a
pause
when
they
might
rush
in
and
*NL*
rescue
her
.
So
situated
,
she
was
powerless
to
check
Jo
,
who
seemed
*NL*
possessed
by
a
spirit
of
mischief
,
and
talked
away
as
volubly
as
the
old
*NL*
lady
.
A
knot
of
heads
gathered
about
her
,
and
Amy
strained
her
ears
to
*NL*
hear
what
was
going
on
;
for
broken
sentences
filled
her
with
alarm
,
*NL*
round
eyes
and
uplifted
hands
tormented
her
with
curiosity
,
and
frequent
*NL*
peals
of
laughter
made
her
wild
to
share
the
fun
.
One
may
imagine
her
*NL*
suffering
on
overhearing
fragments
of
this
sort
of
conversation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
rides
splendidly
,
--
who
taught
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
;
she
used
to
practise
mounting
,
holding
the
reins
,
and
sitting
*NL*
straight
on
an
old
saddle
in
a
tree
.
Now
she
rides
anything
,
for
she
*NL*
does
n't
know
what
fear
is
,
and
the
stable-man
lets
her
have
horses
*NL*
cheap
,
because
she
trains
them
to
carry
ladies
so
well
.
She
has
such
a
*NL*
passion
for
it
,
I
often
tell
her
if
everything
else
fails
she
can
be
a
*NL*
horse-breaker
,
and
get
her
living
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
awful
speech
Amy
contained
herself
with
difficulty
,
for
the
*NL*
impression
was
being
given
that
she
was
rather
a
fast
young
lady
,
which
*NL*
was
her
especial
aversion
.
But
what
could
she
do
?
for
the
old
lady
was
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
her
story
,
and
long
before
it
was
done
Jo
was
off
*NL*
again
,
making
more
droll
revelations
,
and
committing
still
more
fearful
*NL*
blunders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Amy
was
in
despair
that
day
,
for
all
the
good
beasts
were
gone
,
*NL*
and
of
three
left
,
one
was
lame
,
one
blind
,
and
the
other
so
balky
that
*NL*
you
had
to
put
dirt
in
his
mouth
before
he
would
start
.
Nice
animal
for
*NL*
a
pleasure
party
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
did
she
choose
?
''
asked
one
of
the
laughing
gentlemen
,
who
enjoyed
*NL*
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
them
;
she
heard
of
a
young
horse
at
the
farmhouse
over
the
*NL*
river
,
and
,
though
a
lady
had
never
ridden
him
,
she
resolved
to
try
,
*NL*
because
he
was
handsome
and
spirited
.
Her
struggles
were
really
*NL*
pathetic
;
there
was
no
one
to
bring
the
horse
to
the
saddle
,
so
she
took
*NL*
the
saddle
to
the
horse
.
My
dear
creature
,
she
actually
rowed
it
over
*NL*
the
river
,
put
it
on
her
head
,
and
marched
up
to
the
barn
to
the
utter
*NL*
amazement
of
the
old
man
!

Did

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
she
did
,
and
had
a
capital
time

I
expected
to
see
her
*NL*
brought
home
in
fragments
,
but
she
managed
him
perfectly

was
the
*NL*
life

the
party

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
call
that
plucky
!
''
and
young
Mr.
Lamb
turned
an
approving
*NL*
glance
upon
Amy
,
wondering
what
his
mother
could
be
saying
to
make
the
*NL*
girl
look
so
red
and
uncomfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
still
redder
and
more
uncomfortable
a
moment
after
,
when
a
*NL*
sudden
turn
in
the
conversation
introduced
the
subject
of
dress
.
One
of
*NL*
the
young
ladies
asked
Jo
where
she
got
the
pretty
drab
hat
she
wore
to
*NL*
the
picnic
;
and
stupid
Jo
,
instead
of
mentioning
the
place
where
it
was
*NL*
bought
two
years
ago
,
must
needs
answer
,
with
unnecessary
frankness
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Amy
painted
it
;
you
ca
n't
buy
those
soft
shades
,
so
we
paint
ours
*NL*
any
color
we
like
.
It
's
a
great
comfort
to
have
an
artistic
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
that
an
original
idea
?
''
cried
Miss
Lamb
,
who
found
Jo
great
fun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nothing
compared
to
some
of
her
brilliant
performances
.
There
's
*NL*
nothing
the
child
ca
n't
do
.
Why
,
she
wanted
a
pair
of
blue
boots
for
*NL*
Sallie
's
party
,
so
she
just
painted
her
soiled
white
ones
the
loveliest
*NL*
shade
of
sky-blue
you
ever
saw
,
and
they
looked
exactly
like
satin

''
*NL*
added
Jo
,
with
an
air
of
pride
in
her
sister
's
accomplishments
that
*NL*
exasperated
Amy
till
she
felt
that
it
would
be
a
relief
to
throw
her
*NL*
card-case
at
her
.

*NL*
``
We
read
a
story
of
yours
the
other
day

enjoyed
it
very
much
,
''
*NL*
observed
the
elder
Miss
Lamb
,
wishing
to
compliment
the
literary
lady
,
*NL*
who
did
not
look
the
character
just
then
,
it
must
be
confessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
mention
of
her
``
works
''
always
had
a
bad
effect
upon
Jo
,
who
either
*NL*
grew
rigid
and
looked
offended
,
or
changed
the
subject
with
a
_
brusque
_
*NL*
remark
,
as
now
.
``
Sorry
you
could
find
nothing
better
to
read
.
I
write
*NL*
that
rubbish
because
it
sells
,
and
ordinary
people
like
it
.
Are
you
*NL*
going
to
New
York
this
winter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Miss
Lamb
had
``
enjoyed
''
the
story
,
this
speech
was
not
exactly
*NL*
grateful
or
complimentary
.
The
minute
it
was
made
Jo
saw
her
mistake
;
*NL*
but
,
fearing
to
make
the
matter
worse
,
suddenly
remembered
that
it
was
*NL*
for
her
to
make
the
first
move
toward
departure
,
and
did
so
with
an
*NL*
abruptness
that
left
three
people
with
half-finished
sentences
in
their
*NL*
mouths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amy
,
we
_
must
_
go
.
_
Good
_
-
by
,
dear
;
_
do
_
come
and
see
us
;
we
are
*NL*
_
pining
_
for
a
visit
.
I
do
n't
dare
to
ask
_
you
_
,
Mr.
Lamb
;
but
if
you
*NL*
_
should
_
come
,
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
have
the
heart
to
send
you
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
said
this
with
such
a
droll
imitation
of
May
Chester
's
gushing
style
*NL*
that
Amy
got
out
of
the
room
as
rapidly
as
possible
,
feeling
a
strong
*NL*
desire
to
laugh
and
cry
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
I
do
that
well
?
''
asked
Jo
,
with
a
satisfied
air
,
as
they
walked
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
have
been
worse
,
''
was
Amy
's
crushing
reply
.
``
What
*NL*
possessed
you
to
tell
those
stories
about
my
saddle
,
and
the
hats
and
*NL*
boots
,
and
all
the
rest
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
's
funny
,
and
amuses
people
.
They
know
we
are
poor
,
so
it
's
no
*NL*
use
pretending
that
we
have
grooms
,
buy
three
or
four
hats
a
season
,
and
*NL*
have
things
as
easy
and
fine
as
they
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
go
and
tell
them
all
our
little
shifts
,
and
expose
our
*NL*
poverty
in
that
perfectly
unnecessary
way
.
You
have
n't
a
bit
of
proper
*NL*
pride
,
and
never
will
learn
when
to
hold
your
tongue
and
when
to
speak
,
''
*NL*
said
Amy
despairingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jo
looked
abashed
,
and
silently
chafed
the
end
of
her
nose
with
the
*NL*
stiff
handkerchief
,
as
if
performing
a
penance
for
her
misdemeanors
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
shall
I
behave
here
?
''
she
asked
,
as
they
approached
the
third
*NL*
mansion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
please
;
I
wash
my
hands
of
you
,
''
was
Amy
's
short
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
enjoy
myself
.
The
boys
are
at
home
,
and
we
'll
have
a
*NL*
comfortable
time
.
Goodness
knows
I
need
a
little
change
,
for
elegance
*NL*
has
a
bad
effect
upon
my
constitution
,
''
returned
Jo
gruffly
,
being
*NL*
disturbed
by
her
failures
to
suit
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
enthusiastic
welcome
from
three
big
boys
and
several
pretty
children
*NL*
speedily
soothed
her
ruffled
feelings
;
and
,
leaving
Amy
to
entertain
the
*NL*
hostess
and
Mr.
Tudor
,
who
happened
to
be
calling
likewise
,
Jo
devoted
*NL*
herself
to
the
young
folks
,
and
found
the
change
refreshing
.
She
*NL*
listened
to
college
stories
with
deep
interest
,
caressed
pointers
and
*NL*
poodles
without
a
murmur
,
agreed
heartily
that
``
Tom
Brown
was
a
brick
,
''
*NL*
regardless
of
the
improper
form
of
praise
;
and
when
one
lad
proposed
a
*NL*
visit
to
his
turtle-tank
,
she
went
with
an
alacrity
which
caused
mamma
*NL*
to
smile
upon
her
,
as
that
motherly
lady
settled
the
cap
which
was
left
*NL*
in
a
ruinous
condition
by
filial
hugs
,
bear-like
but
affectionate
,
and
*NL*
dearer
to
her
than
the
most
faultless
_
coiffure
_
from
the
hands
of
an
*NL*
inspired
Frenchwoman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
her
sister
to
her
own
devices
,
Amy
proceeded
to
enjoy
herself
to
*NL*
her
heart
's
content
.
Mr.
Tudor
's
uncle
had
married
an
English
lady
who
*NL*
was
third
cousin
to
a
living
lord
,
and
Amy
regarded
the
whole
family
*NL*
with
great
respect
;
for
,
in
spite
of
her
American
birth
and
breeding
,
*NL*
she
possessed
that
reverence
for
titles
which
haunts
the
best
of
*NL*
us
,
--
that
unacknowledged
loyalty
to
the
early
faith
in
kings
which
set
*NL*
the
most
democratic
nation
under
the
sun
in
a
ferment
at
the
coming
of
a
*NL*
royal
yellow-haired
laddie
,
some
years
ago
,
and
which
still
has
*NL*
something
to
do
with
the
love
the
young
country
bears
the
old
,
like
that
*NL*
of
a
big
son
for
an
imperious
little
mother
,
who
held
him
while
she
*NL*
could
,
and
let
him
go
with
a
farewell
scolding
when
he
rebelled
.
But
*NL*
even
the
satisfaction
of
talking
with
a
distant
connection
of
the
*NL*
British
nobility
did
not
render
Amy
forgetful
of
time
;
and
when
the
*NL*
proper
number
of
minutes
had
passed
,
she
reluctantly
tore
herself
from
*NL*
this
aristocratic
society
,
and
looked
about
for
Jo
,
fervently
hoping
*NL*
that
her
incorrigible
sister
would
not
be
found
in
any
position
which
*NL*
should
bring
disgrace
upon
the
name
of
March
.

*NL*
*NL*
It
might
have
been
worse
,
but
Amy
considered
it
bad
;
for
Jo
sat
on
the
*NL*
grass
,
with
an
encampment
of
boys
about
her
,
and
a
dirty-footed
dog
*NL*
reposing
on
the
skirt
of
her
state
and
festival
dress
,
as
she
related
*NL*
one
of
Laurie
's
pranks
to
her
admiring
audience
.
One
small
child
was
*NL*
poking
turtles
with
Amy
's
cherished
parasol
,
a
second
was
eating
*NL*
gingerbread
over
Jo
's
best
bonnet
,
and
a
third
playing
ball
with
her
*NL*
gloves
.
But
all
were
enjoying
themselves
;
and
when
Jo
collected
her
*NL*
damaged
property
to
go
,
her
escort
accompanied
her
,
begging
her
to
come
*NL*
again
,
``
it
was
such
fun
to
hear
about
Laurie
's
larks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
boys
,
are
n't
they
?
I
feel
quite
young
and
brisk
again
after
*NL*
that
,
''
said
Jo
,
strolling
along
with
her
hands
behind
her
,
partly
from
*NL*
habit
,
partly
to
conceal
the
bespattered
parasol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
you
always
avoid
Mr.
Tudor
?
''
asked
Amy
,
wisely
refraining
from
*NL*
any
comment
upon
Jo
's
dilapidated
appearance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
like
him
;
he
puts
on
airs
,
snubs
his
sisters
,
worries
his
father
,
*NL*
and
does
n't
speak
respectfully
of
his
mother
.
Laurie
says
he
is
fast
,
*NL*
and
_
I
_
do
n't
consider
him
a
desirable
acquaintance
;
so
I
let
him
*NL*
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
treat
him
civilly
,
at
least
.
You
gave
him
a
cool
nod
;
and
*NL*
just
now
you
bowed
and
smiled
in
the
politest
way
to
Tommy
Chamberlain
,
*NL*
whose
father
keeps
a
grocery
store
.
If
you
had
just
reversed
the
nod
and
*NL*
the
bow
,
it
would
have
been
right

''
said
Amy
reprovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
would
n't
,
''
returned
perverse
Jo
;
``
I
neither
like

respect

*NL*
admire
Tudor

though
his
grandfather

uncle
's
nephew

was
_
*NL*
third
cousin
to
a
lord

Tommy
is
poor
and
bashful

good
and
very
*NL*
clever
;
I
think
well
of
him
,
and
like
to
show
that
I
do
,
for
he

a

gentleman

brown-paper
parcels

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no

began
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
the
least

my
dear

''
interrupted
Jo
;
``
so
let
us
look
amiable

*NL*
drop
a
card
here

Kings
are
evidently
out

which
I
'm
deeply
*NL*
grateful

*NL*
*NL*
The
family
card-case
having
done
its
duty
,
the
girls
walked
on
,
and
Jo
*NL*
uttered
another
thanksgiving
on
reaching
the
fifth
house
,
and
being
told
*NL*
that
the
young
ladies
were
engaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
let
us
go
home
,
and
never
mind
Aunt
March
to-day
.
We
can
run
down
*NL*
there
any
time
,
and
it
's
really
a
pity
to
trail
through
the
dust
in
our
*NL*
best
bibs

tuckers
,
when
we
are
tired

cross

*NL*
*NL*
``
Speak

Aunt

pay
her
the

compliment

coming
in
style

and
making
a
formal
call
;
it
's
a
little
*NL*
thing
to
do
,

it
gives
her
pleasure
,

I
do
n't
believe
it
will
hurt

your
things
half
so
much

letting

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
good
girl
you
are

said
Jo
,
with
a
repentant
glance
from
*NL*
her
own
damaged
costume
to
that
of
her
sister
,
which
was
fresh
and
*NL*
spotless
still
.

wish

things

think
of
them

it
takes
too
much
*NL*
time
to
do
them
;
so
I
wait
for
a
chance
to
confer
a
great
favor

let
*NL*
the
small
ones
slip
;

they
tell
best
in
the
end

I
fancy

*NL*
*NL*
Amy
smiled
,
and
was
mollified
at
once
,
saying
with
a
maternal
air
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Women
should
learn

agreeable

the
kindnesses
they
receive

If
you

*NL*
remember
that

better

be
pleasant

strong

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

a
greater
not

I
do

saying
that
I

approve
of

any
more
than
you
do

I

not
called

solemn
conviction

which
would
have
*NL*
convulsed
the
``

If

smile
upon
another

duty
,
kept
her
temper
,
and
pleased
*NL*
everybody
,
was
in
a
most
angelic
frame
of
mind
.
This
amiable
spirit
was
*NL*
felt
at
once
,
and
both
the
aunts
``
my
deared
''
her
affectionately
,
looking
*NL*
what
they
afterwards
said
emphatically
,
--
``
That
child
improves
every
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
to
help
about
the
fair
,
dear
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Carrol
,
as
Amy
*NL*
sat
down
beside
her
with
the
confiding
air
elderly
people
like
so
well
*NL*
in
the
young
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
aunt
.
Mrs.
Chester
asked
me
if
I
would
,
and
I
offered
to
tend
a
*NL*
table
,
as
I
have
nothing
but
my
time
to
give
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
,
''
put
in
Jo
decidedly
.
``
I
hate
to
be
patronized
,
and
the
*NL*
Chesters
think
it
's
a
great
favor
to
allow
us
to
help
with
their
highly
*NL*
connected
fair
.
I
wonder
you
consented
,
Amy
:
they
only
want
you
to
*NL*
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
willing
to
work
:
it
's
for
the
freedmen
as
well
as
the
Chesters
,
*NL*
and
I
think
it
very
kind
of
them
to
let
me
share
the
labor
and
the
fun
.
*NL*
Patronage
does
not
trouble
me
when
it
is
well
meant

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
and
proper
.
I
like
your
grateful
spirit
,
my
dear
;
it
's
a
*NL*
pleasure
to
help
people
who
appreciate
our
efforts
:
some
do
not
,
and
*NL*
that
is
trying
,
''
observed
Aunt
March
,
looking
over
her
spectacles
at
Jo
,
*NL*
who
sat
apart
,
rocking
herself
,
with
a
somewhat
morose
expression
.

*NL*
If
Jo
had
only
known
what
a
great
happiness
was
wavering
in
the
balance
*NL*
for
one
of
them
,
she
would
have
turned
dovelike
in
a
minute
;
but
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
we
do
n't
have
windows
in
our
breasts
,
and
can
not
see
what
*NL*
goes
on
in
the
minds
of
our
friends
;
better
for
us
that
we
can
not
as
a
*NL*
general
thing
,
but
now
and
then
it
would
be
such
a
comfort
,
such
a
*NL*
saving
of
time
and
temper
.
By
her
next
speech
,
Jo
deprived
herself
of
*NL*
several
years
of
pleasure
,
and
received
a
timely
lesson
in
the
art
of
*NL*
holding
her
tongue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
like
favors
;
they
oppress
and
make
me
feel
like
a
slave
.
I
'd
*NL*
rather
do
everything
for
myself
,
and
be
perfectly
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ahem
!
''
coughed
Aunt
Carrol
softly
,
with
a
look
at
Aunt
March
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
you
so
,
''
said
Aunt
March
,
with
a
decided
nod
to
Aunt
Carrol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercifully
unconscious
of
what
she
had
done
,
Jo
sat
with
her
nose
in
the
*NL*
air
,
and
a
revolutionary
aspect
which
was
anything
but
inviting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
speak
French
,
dear
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Carrol
,
laying
her
hand
on
*NL*
Amy
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
well
,
thanks
to
Aunt
March
,
who
lets
Esther
talk
to
me
as
often
*NL*
as
I
like
,
''
replied
Amy
,
with
a
grateful
look
,
which
caused
the
old
lady
*NL*
to
smile
affably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
about
languages
?
''
asked
Mrs.
Carrol
of
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
a
word
;
I
'm
very
stupid
about
studying
anything
;
ca
n't
bear
*NL*
French
,
it
's
such
a
slippery
,
silly
sort
of
language
,
''
was
the
_
brusque
_
*NL*
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
look
passed
between
the
ladies
,
and
Aunt
March
said
to
Amy
,
``
You
*NL*
are
quite
strong
and
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

you

things
next

so
that
I
may
be

Rome

whenever
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

You
deserve

I

sure
you
will
some

''
said
*NL*
Aunt
March
,
with
an
approving
pat
on
the
head
,
as
Amy
picked
up
her
ball
*NL*
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cross-patch

the
latch
,
*NL*
Sit
by
the
fire

''
*NL*
*NL*
squalled
Polly
,
bending
down
from
his
perch
on
the
back
of
her
chair
to
*NL*
peep
into
Jo
's
face
,
with
such
a
comical
air
of
impertinent
inquiry
that
*NL*
it
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Most
observing
bird
,
''
said
the
old
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
and
take
a
walk
,
my
dear
?
''
cried
Polly
,
hopping
toward
the
*NL*
china-closet
,
with
a
look
suggestive
of
lump-sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
I
will
.
Come
,
Amy
;
''
and
Jo
brought
the
visit
to
an
end
,
*NL*
feeling
more
strongly
than
ever
that
calls
did
have
a
bad
effect
upon
*NL*
her
constitution
.
She
shook
hands
in
a
gentlemanly
manner
,
but
Amy
*NL*
kissed
both
the
aunts
,
and
the
girls
departed
,
leaving
behind
them
the
*NL*
impression
of
shadow
and
sunshine
;
which
impression
caused
Aunt
March
to
*NL*
say
,
as
they
vanished
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
do
it
,
Mary
;
I
'll
supply
the
money

and
Aunt
Carrol
to
*NL*
reply
decidedly
,
``

CONSEQUENCES
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Chester
's
fair
was
so
very
elegant
and
select
that
it
was
*NL*
considered
a
great
honor
by
the
young
ladies
of
the
neighborhood
to
be
*NL*
invited
to
take
a
table
,
and
every
one
was
much
interested
in
the
*NL*
matter
.
Amy
was
asked
,
but
Jo
was
not
,
which
was
fortunate
for
all
*NL*
parties
,
as
her
elbows
were
decidedly
akimbo
at
this
period
of
her
life
,
*NL*
and
it
took
a
good
many
hard
knocks
to
teach
her
how
to
get
on
easily
.
*NL*
The
``
haughty
,
uninteresting
creature
''
was
let
severely
alone
;
but
Amy
's
*NL*
talent
and
taste
were
duly
complimented
by
the
offer
of
the
art-table
,
*NL*
and
she
exerted
herself
to
prepare
and
secure
appropriate
and
valuable
*NL*
contributions
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
went
on
smoothly
till
the
day
before
the
fair
opened
;
then
*NL*
there
occurred
one
of
the
little
skirmishes
which
it
is
almost
*NL*
impossible
to
avoid
,
when
some
five
and
twenty
women
,
old
and
young
,
*NL*
with
all
their
private
piques
and
prejudices
,
try
to
work
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
Chester
was
rather
jealous
of
Amy
because
the
latter
was
a
greater
*NL*
favorite
than
herself
,
and
,
just
at
this
time
,
several
trifling
*NL*
circumstances
occurred
to
increase
the
feeling
.
Amy
's
dainty
pen-and-ink
*NL*
work
entirely
eclipsed
May
's
painted
vases
,
--
that
was
one
thorn
;
then
*NL*
the
all-conquering
Tudor
had
danced
four
times
with
Amy
,
at
a
late
*NL*
party
,
and
only
once
with
May
,
--
that
was
thorn
number
two
;
but
the
chief
*NL*
grievance
that
rankled
in
her
soul
,
and
gave
her
an
excuse
for
her
*NL*
unfriendly
conduct
,
was
a
rumor
which
some
obliging
gossip
had
whispered
*NL*
to
her
,
that
the
March
girls
had
made
fun
of
her
at
the
Lambs
'
.
All
the
*NL*
blame
of
this
should
have
fallen
upon
Jo
,
for
her
naughty
imitation
had
*NL*
been
too
lifelike
to
escape
detection
,
and
the
frolicsome
Lambs
had
*NL*
permitted
the
joke
to
escape
.
No
hint
of
this
had
reached
the
culprits
,
*NL*
however
,
and
Amy
's
dismay
can
be
imagined
,
when
,
the
very
evening
before
*NL*
the
fair
,
as
she
was
putting
the
last
touches
to
her
pretty
table
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Chester
,
who
,
of
course
,
resented
the
supposed
ridicule
of
her
daughter
,
*NL*
said
,
in
a
bland
tone
,
but
with
a
cold
look
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
find
,
dear
,
that
there
is
some
feeling
among
the
young
ladies
about
*NL*
my
giving
this
table
to
any
one
but
my
girls
.
As
this
is
the
most
*NL*
prominent
,
and
some
say
the
most
attractive
table
of
all
,
and
they
are
*NL*
the
chief
getters-up
of
the
fair
,
it
is
thought
best
for
them
to
take
*NL*
this
place
.
I
'm
sorry
,
but
I
know
you
are
too
sincerely
interested
in
*NL*
the
cause
to
mind
a
little
personal
disappointment
,
and
you
shall
have
*NL*
another
table
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Chester
had
fancied
beforehand
that
it
would
be
easy
to
deliver
*NL*
this
little
speech
;
but
when
the
time
came
,
she
found
it
rather
*NL*
difficult
to
utter
it
naturally
,
with
Amy
's
unsuspicious
eyes
looking
*NL*
straight
at
her
,
full
of
surprise
and
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
felt
that
there
was
something
behind
this
,
but
could
not
guess
what
,
*NL*
and
said
quietly
,
feeling
hurt
,
and
showing
that
she
did
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
had
rather
I
took
no
table
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
have
any
ill
feeling
,
I
beg
;
it
's
merely
a
matter
*NL*
of
expediency
,
you
see
;
my
girls
will
naturally
take
the
lead
,
and
this
*NL*
table
is
considered
their
proper
place
.
_
I
_
think
it
very
appropriate
*NL*
to
you
,
and
feel
very
grateful
for
your
efforts
to
make
it
so
pretty
;
*NL*
but
we
must
give
up
our
private
wishes
,
of
course
,
and
I
will
see
that
*NL*
you
have
a
good
place
elsewhere
.
Would
n't
you
like
the
flower-table
?
The
*NL*
little
girls
undertook
it
,
but
they
are
discouraged
.
You
could
make
a
*NL*
charming
thing
of
it
,
and
the
flower-table
is
always
attractive
,
you
*NL*
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Especially
to
gentlemen
,
''
added
May
,
with
a
look
which
enlightened
Amy
*NL*
as
to
one
cause
of
her
sudden
fall
from
favor
.
She
colored
angrily
,
but
*NL*
took
no
other
notice
of
that
girlish
sarcasm
,
and
answered
,
with
*NL*
unexpected
amiability
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
as
you
please
,
Mrs.
Chester
.
I
'll
give
up
my
place
here
at
*NL*
once
,
and
attend
to
the
flowers
,
if
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
put
your
own
things
on
your
own
table
,
if
you
prefer
,
''
began
*NL*
May
,
feeling
a
little
conscience-stricken
,
as
she
looked
at
the
pretty
*NL*
racks
,
the
painted
shells
,
and
quaint
illuminations
Amy
had
so
carefully
*NL*
made
and
so
gracefully
arranged
.
She
meant
it
kindly
,
but
Amy
mistook
*NL*
her
meaning
,
and
said
quickly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
certainly
,
if
they
are
in
your
way
;
''
and
sweeping
her
contributions
*NL*
into
her
apron
,
pell-mell
,
she
walked
off
,
feeling
that
herself
and
her
*NL*
works
of
art
had
been
insulted
past
forgiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
she
's
mad
.
Oh
,
dear
,
I
wish
I
had
n't
asked
you
to
speak
,
mamma
,
''
*NL*
said
May
,
looking
disconsolately
at
the
empty
spaces
on
her
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Girls
'
quarrels
are
soon
over
,
''
returned
her
mother
,
feeling
a
trifle
*NL*
ashamed
of
her
own
part
in
this
one
,
as
well
she
might
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girls
hailed
Amy
and
her
treasures
with
delight
,
which
*NL*
cordial
reception
somewhat
soothed
her
perturbed
spirit
,
and
she
fell
to
*NL*
work
,
determined
to
succeed
florally
,
if
she
could
not
artistically
.
But
*NL*
everything
seemed
against
her
:
it
was
late
,
and
she
was
tired
;
every
one
*NL*
was
too
busy
with
their
own
affairs
to
help
her
;
and
the
little
girls
*NL*
were
only
hindrances
,
for
the
dears
fussed
and
chattered
like
so
many
*NL*
magpies
,
making
a
great
deal
of
confusion
in
their
artless
efforts
to
*NL*
preserve
the
most
perfect
order
.
The
evergreen
arch
would
n't
stay
firm
*NL*
after
she
got
it
up
,
but
wiggled
and
threatened
to
tumble
down
on
her
*NL*
head
when
the
hanging
baskets
were
filled
;
her
best
tile
got
a
splash
of
*NL*
water
,
which
left
a
sepia
tear
on
the
Cupid
's
cheek
;
she
bruised
her
*NL*
hands
with
hammering
,
and
got
cold
working
in
a
draught
,
which
last
*NL*
affliction
filled
her
with
apprehensions
for
the
morrow
.
Any
girl-reader
*NL*
who
has
suffered
like
afflictions
will
sympathize
with
poor
Amy
,
and
*NL*
wish
her
well
through
with
her
task
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
great
indignation
at
home
when
she
told
her
story
that
*NL*
evening
.
Her
mother
said
it
was
a
shame
,
but
told
her
she
had
done
*NL*
right
;
Beth
declared
she
would
n't
go
to
the
fair
at
all
;
and
Jo
demanded
*NL*
why
she
did
n't
take
all
her
pretty
things
and
leave
those
mean
people
to
*NL*
get
on
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
they
are
mean
is
no
reason
why
I
should
be
.
I
hate
such
things
,
*NL*
and
though
I
think
I
've
a
right
to
be
hurt
,
I
do
n't
intend
to
show
it
.
*NL*
They
will
feel
that
more
than
angry
speeches
or
huffy
actions
,
wo
n't
*NL*
they
,
Marmee
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
right
spirit
,
my
dear
;
a
kiss
for
a
blow
is
always
best

*NL*
though
it
's
not
very
easy
to
give
it
sometimes

said
her
mother
,
with
*NL*
the
air
of
one
who
had
learned
the
difference
between
preaching
and
*NL*
practising
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
various
very
natural
temptations
to
resent
and
retaliate
,
*NL*
Amy
adhered
to
her
resolution
all
the
next
day
,
bent
on
conquering
her
*NL*
enemy
by
kindness
.
She
began
well
,
thanks
to
a
silent
reminder
that
came
*NL*
to
her
unexpectedly
,
but
most
opportunely
.
As
she
arranged
her
table
*NL*
that
morning
,
while
the
little
girls
were
in
an
ante-room
filling
the
*NL*
baskets
,
she
took
up
her
pet
production
,
--
a
little
book
,
the
antique
*NL*
cover
of
which
her
father
had
found
among
his
treasures
,
and
in
which
,
*NL*
on
leaves
of
vellum
,
she
had
beautifully
illuminated
different
texts
.
As
*NL*
she
turned
the
pages
,
rich
in
dainty
devices
,
with
very
pardonable
*NL*
pride
,
her
eye
fell
upon
one
verse
that
made
her
stop
and
think
.
Framed
*NL*
in
a
brilliant
scroll-work
of
scarlet
,
blue
,
and
gold
,
with
little
*NL*
spirits
of
good-will
helping
one
another
up
and
down
among
the
thorns
*NL*
and
flowers
,
were
the
words
,
``
Thou
shalt
love
thy
neighbor
as
thyself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
,
but
I
do
n't
,
''
thought
Amy
,
as
her
eye
went
from
the
bright
*NL*
page
to
May
's
discontented
face
behind
the
big
vases
,
that
could
not
*NL*
hide
the
vacancies
her
pretty
work
had
once
filled
.
Amy
stood
a
minute
,
*NL*
turning
the
leaves
in
her
hand
,
reading
on
each
some
sweet
rebuke
for
*NL*
all
heart-burnings
and
uncharitableness
of
spirit
.
Many
wise
and
true
*NL*
sermons
are
preached
us
every
day
by
unconscious
ministers
in
street
,
*NL*
school
,
office
,
or
home
;
even
a
fair-table
may
become
a
pulpit
,
if
it
*NL*
can
offer
the
good
and
helpful
words
which
are
never
out
of
season
.
*NL*
Amy
's
conscience
preached
her
a
little
sermon
from
that
text
,
then
and
*NL*
there
;
and
she
did
what
many
of
us
do
not
always
do
,
--
took
the
sermon
to
*NL*
heart
,
and
straightway
put
it
in
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
group
of
girls
were
standing
about
May
's
table
,
admiring
the
pretty
*NL*
things
,
and
talking
over
the
change
of
saleswomen
.
They
dropped
their
*NL*
voices
,
but
Amy
knew
they
were
speaking
of
her
,
hearing
one
side
of
the
*NL*
story
,
and
judging
accordingly
.
It
was
not
pleasant
,
but
a
better
spirit
*NL*
had
come
over
her
,
and
presently
a
chance
offered
for
proving
it
.
She
*NL*
heard
May
say
sorrowfully
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
too
bad
,
for
there
is
no
time
to
make
other
things
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
fill
up
with
odds
and
ends
.
The
table
was
just
complete
then
:
*NL*
now
it
's
spoilt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
she
'd
put
them
back
if
you
asked
her
,
''
suggested
some
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
I
after
all
the
fuss
?
''
began
May
,
but
she
did
not
finish
,
for
*NL*
Amy
's
voice
came
across
the
hall
,
saying
pleasantly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
have
them
,
and
welcome
,
without
asking
,
if
you
want
them
.
I
was
*NL*
just
thinking
I
'd
offer
to
put
them
back
,
for
they
belong
to
your
table
*NL*
rather
than
mine
.
Here
they
are
;
please
take
them
,
and
forgive
me
if
I
*NL*
was
hasty
in
carrying
them
away
last
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
spoke
,
Amy
returned
her
contribution
,
with
a
nod
and
a
smile
,
and
*NL*
hurried
away
again
,
feeling
that
it
was
easier
to
do
a
friendly
thing
*NL*
than
it
was
to
stay
and
be
thanked
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
I
call
that
lovely
of
her
,
do
n't
you
?
''
cried
one
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
May
's
answer
was
inaudible
;
but
another
young
lady
,
whose
temper
was
*NL*
evidently
a
little
soured
by
making
lemonade
,
added
,
with
a
disagreeable
*NL*
laugh
,
``
Very
lovely
;
for
she
knew
she
would
n't
sell
them
at
her
own
*NL*
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
that
was
hard
;
when
we
make
little
sacrifices
we
like
to
have
them
*NL*
appreciated
,
at
least
;
and
for
a
minute
Amy
was
sorry
she
had
done
it
,
*NL*
feeling
that
virtue
was
not
always
its
own
reward
.
But
it
is
,
--
as
she
*NL*
presently
discovered
;
for
her
spirits
began
to
rise
,
and
her
table
to
*NL*
blossom
under
her
skilful
hands
;
the
girls
were
very
kind
,
and
that
one
*NL*
little
act
seemed
to
have
cleared
the
atmosphere
amazingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
long
day
,
and
a
hard
one
to
Amy
,
as
she
sat
behind
her
*NL*
table
,
often
quite
alone
,
for
the
little
girls
deserted
very
soon
:
few
*NL*
cared
to
buy
flowers
in
summer
,
and
her
bouquets
began
to
droop
long
*NL*
before
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
art-table
_
was
_
the
most
attractive
in
the
room
;
there
was
a
crowd
*NL*
about
it
all
day
long
,
and
the
tenders
were
constantly
flying
to
and
fro
*NL*
with
important
faces
and
rattling
money-boxes
.
Amy
often
looked
*NL*
wistfully
across
,
longing
to
be
there
,
where
she
felt
at
home
and
happy
,
*NL*
instead
of
in
a
corner
with
nothing
to
do
.
It
might
seem
no
hardship
to
*NL*
some
of
us
;
but
to
a
pretty
,
blithe
young
girl
,
it
was
not
only
tedious
,
*NL*
but
very
trying
;
and
the
thought
of
being
found
there
in
the
evening
by
*NL*
her
family
,
and
Laurie
and
his
friends
,
made
it
a
real
martyrdom
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
go
home
till
night
,
and
then
she
looked
so
pale
and
quiet
*NL*
that
they
knew
the
day
had
been
a
hard
one
,
though
she
made
no
*NL*
complaint
,
and
did
not
even
tell
what
she
had
done
.
Her
mother
gave
her
*NL*
an
extra
cordial
cup
of
tea
,
Beth
helped
her
dress
,
and
made
a
charming
*NL*
little
wreath
for
her
hair
,
while
Jo
astonished
her
family
by
getting
*NL*
herself
up
with
unusual
care
,
and
hinting
darkly
that
the
tables
were
*NL*
about
to
be
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
do
anything
rude
,
pray
,
Jo
.
I
wo
n't
have
any
fuss
made
,
so
let
it
*NL*
all
pass
,
and
behave
yourself
,
''
begged
Amy
,
as
she
departed
early
,
*NL*
hoping
to
find
a
reinforcement
of
flowers
to
refresh
her
poor
little
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
merely
intend
to
make
myself
entrancingly
agreeable
to
every
one
I
*NL*
know
,
and
to
keep
them
in
your
corner
as
long
as
possible
.
Teddy
and
his
*NL*
boys
will
lend
a
hand
,
and
we
'll
have
a
good
time
yet
,
''
returned
Jo
,
*NL*
leaning
over
the
gate
to
watch
for
Laurie
.
Presently
the
familiar
tramp
*NL*
was
heard
in
the
dusk
,
and
she
ran
out
to
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
my
boy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
sure
as
this
is
my
girl
!
''
and
Laurie
tucked
her
hand
under
his
arm
,
*NL*
with
the
air
of
a
man
whose
every
wish
was
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Teddy
,
such
doings
!
''
and
Jo
told
Amy
's
wrongs
with
sisterly
zeal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
flock
of
our
fellows
are
going
to
drive
over
by
and
by
,
and
I
'll
be
*NL*
hanged
if
I
do
n't
make
them
buy
every
flower
she
's
got
,
and
camp
down
*NL*
before
her
table
afterward
,
''
said
Laurie
,
espousing
her
cause
with
*NL*
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
flowers
are
not
at
all
nice
,
Amy
says
,
and
the
fresh
ones
may
not
*NL*
arrive
in
time
.
I
do
n't
wish
to
be
unjust
or
suspicious
,
but
I
should
n't
*NL*
wonder
if
they
never
came
at
all
.
When
people
do
one
mean
thing
they
are
*NL*
very
likely
to
do
another
,
''
observed
Jo
,
in
a
disgusted
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
Hayes
give
you
the
best
out
of
our
gardens
?
I
told
him
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
know
that
;
he
forgot
,
I
suppose
;
and
,
as
your
grandpa
was
*NL*
poorly
,
I
did
n't
like
to
worry
him
by
asking
,
though
I
did
want
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Jo
,
how
could
you
think
there
was
any
need
of
asking
!
They
are
*NL*
just
as
much
yours
as
mine
.
Do
n't
we
always
go
halves
in
everything
?
''
*NL*
began
Laurie
,
in
the
tone
that
always
made
Jo
turn
thorny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
,
I
hope
not
!
half
of
some
of
your
things
would
n't
suit
me
at
*NL*
all
.
But
we
must
n't
stand
philandering
here
;
I
've
got
to
help
Amy
,
so
*NL*
you
go
and
make
yourself
splendid
;
and
if
you
'll
be
so
very
kind
as
to
*NL*
let
Hayes
take
a
few
nice
flowers
up
to
the
Hall
,
I
'll
bless
you
*NL*
forever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Could
n't
you
do
it
now
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
so
suggestively
that
Jo
shut
the
*NL*
gate
in
his
face
with
inhospitable
haste
,
and
called
through
the
bars
,
*NL*
``
Go
away
,
Teddy
;
I
'm
busy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
the
conspirators
,
the
tables
_
were
_
turned
that
night
;
for
*NL*
Hayes
sent
up
a
wilderness
of
flowers
,
with
a
lovely
basket
,
arranged
in
*NL*
his
best
manner
,
for
a
centre-piece
;
then
the
March
family
turned
out
*NL*
_
en
masse
_
,
and
Jo
exerted
herself
to
some
purpose
,
for
people
not
only
*NL*
came
,
but
stayed
,
laughing
at
her
nonsense
,
admiring
Amy
's
taste
,
and
*NL*
apparently
enjoying
themselves
very
much
.
Laurie
and
his
friends
*NL*
gallantly
threw
themselves
into
the
breach
,
bought
up
the
bouquets
,
*NL*
encamped
before
the
table
,
and
made
that
corner
the
liveliest
spot
in
*NL*
the
room
.
Amy
was
in
her
element
now
,
and
,
out
of
gratitude
,
if
nothing
*NL*
more
,
was
as
sprightly
and
gracious
as
possible
,
--
coming
to
the
*NL*
conclusion
,
about
that
time
,
that
virtue
_
was
_
its
own
reward
,
after
*NL*
all
.

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
behaved
herself
with
exemplary
propriety
;
and
when
Amy
was
happily
*NL*
surrounded
by
her
guard
of
honor
,
Jo
circulated
about
the
hall
,
picking
*NL*
up
various
bits
of
gossip
,
which
enlightened
her
upon
the
subject
of
the
*NL*
Chester
change
of
base
.
She
reproached
herself
for
her
share
of
the
*NL*
ill-feeling
,
and
resolved
to
exonerate
Amy
as
soon
as
possible
;
she
also
*NL*
discovered
what
Amy
had
done
about
the
things
in
the
morning
,
and
*NL*
considered
her
a
model
of
magnanimity
.
As
she
passed
the
art-table
,
she
*NL*
glanced
over
it
for
her
sister
's
things
,
but
saw
no
signs
of
them
.
*NL*
``
Tucked
away
out
of
sight
,
I
dare
say
,
''
thought
Jo
,
who
could
forgive
*NL*
her
own
wrongs
,
but
hotly
resented
any
insult
offered
to
her
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Miss
Jo
.
How
does
Amy
get
on
?
''
asked
May
,
with
a
*NL*
conciliatory
air
,
for
she
wanted
to
show
that
she
also
could
be
*NL*
generous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
sold
everything
she
had
that
was
worth
selling
,
and
now
she
is
*NL*
enjoying
herself
.
The
flower-table
is
always
attractive
,
you
know
,
*NL*
`
especially
to
gentlemen
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
_
could
n't
_
resist
giving
that
little
slap
,
but
May
took
it
so
meekly
*NL*
she
regretted
it
a
minute
after
,
and
fell
to
praising
the
great
vases
,
*NL*
which
still
remained
unsold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Amy
's
illumination
anywhere
about
?
I
took
a
fancy
to
buy
that
for
*NL*
father
,
''
said
Jo
,
very
anxious
to
learn
the
fate
of
her
sister
's
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
of
Amy
's
sold
long
ago
;
I
took
care
that
the
right
people
*NL*
saw
them
,
and
they
made
a
nice
little
sum
of
money
for
us
,
''
returned
*NL*
May
,
who
had
overcome
sundry
small
temptations
,
as
well
as
Amy
,
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
gratified
,
Jo
rushed
back
to
tell
the
good
news
;
and
Amy
looked
*NL*
both
touched
and
surprised
by
the
report
of
May
's
words
and
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
gentlemen
,
I
want
you
to
go
and
do
your
duty
by
the
other
tables
*NL*
as
generously
as
you
have
by
mine

especially
the
art-table

she
said
,
*NL*
ordering
out
``
Teddy

as
the
girls
called
the
college
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Charge

is
the
motto
for
that
table
;
but
do
your
*NL*
duty
like
men
,
and
you
'll
get
your
money
's
worth
of
_
art
_
in
every
sense
*NL*
of
the
word
,
''
said
the
irrepressible
Jo
,
as
the
devoted
phalanx
prepared
*NL*
to
take
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
hear
is
to
obey
,
but
March
is
fairer
far
than
May

''
said
little
*NL*
Parker
,
making
a
frantic
effort
to
be
both
witty
and
tender
,
and
getting
*NL*
promptly
quenched
by
Laurie
,
who
said
,
``
Very
well
,
my
son
,
for
a
small
*NL*
boy
!
''
and
walked
him
off
,
with
a
paternal
pat
on
the
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Buy
the
vases
,
''
whispered
Amy
to
Laurie
,
as
a
final
heaping
of
coals
of
*NL*
fire
on
her
enemy
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
May
's
great
delight
,
Mr.
Laurence
not
only
bought
the
vases
,
but
*NL*
pervaded
the
hall
with
one
under
each
arm
.
The
other
gentlemen
*NL*
speculated
with
equal
rashness
in
all
sorts
of
frail
trifles
,
and
*NL*
wandered
helplessly
about
afterward
,
burdened
with
wax
flowers
,
painted
*NL*
fans
,
filigree
portfolios
,
and
other
useful
and
appropriate
purchases
.
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Carrol
was
there
,
heard
the
story
,
looked
pleased
,
and
said
*NL*
something
to
Mrs.
March
in
a
corner
,
which
made
the
latter
lady
beam
*NL*
with
satisfaction
,
and
watch
Amy
with
a
face
full
of
mingled
pride
and
*NL*
anxiety
,
though
she
did
not
betray
the
cause
of
her
pleasure
till
*NL*
several
days
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fair
was
pronounced
a
success
;
and
when
May
bade
Amy
good
night
,
she
*NL*
did
not
``
gush
''
as
usual
,
but
gave
her
an
affectionate
kiss
,
and
a
look
*NL*
which
said
,
``
Forgive
and
forget
.
''
That
satisfied
Amy
;
and
when
she
got
*NL*
home
she
found
the
vases
paraded
on
the
parlor
chimney-piece
,
with
a
*NL*
great
bouquet
in
each
.
``
The
reward
of
merit
for
a
magnanimous
March
,
''
as
*NL*
Laurie
announced
with
a
flourish
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
a
deal
more
principle
and
generosity
and
nobleness
of
character
*NL*
than
I
ever
gave
you
credit
for
,
Amy
.
You
've
behaved
sweetly
,
and
I
*NL*
respect
you
with
all
my
heart
,
''
said
Jo
warmly
,
as
they
brushed
their
*NL*
hair
together
late
that
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
all
do
,
and
love
her
for
being
so
ready
to
forgive
.
It
must
*NL*
have
been
dreadfully
hard
,
after
working
so
long
,
and
setting
your
heart
*NL*
on
selling
your
own
pretty
things
.
I
do
n't
believe
I
could
have
done
it
*NL*
as
kindly
as
you
did
,
''
added
Beth
from
her
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
girls
,
you
need
n't
praise
me
so
;
I
only
did
as
I
'd
be
done
by
.
You
*NL*
laugh
at
me
when
I
say
I
want
to
be
a
lady
,
but
I
mean
a
true
*NL*
gentlewoman
in
mind
and
manners
,
and
I
try
to
do
it
as
far
as
I
know
*NL*
how
.
I
ca
n't
explain
exactly
,
but
I
want
to
be
above
the
little
*NL*
meannesses
and
follies
and
faults
that
spoil
so
many
women
.
I
'm
far
from
*NL*
it
now
,
but
I
do
my
best
,
and
hope
in
time
to
be
what
mother
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
spoke
earnestly
,
and
Jo
said
,
with
a
cordial
hug
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
now
what
you
mean
,
and
I
'll
never
laugh
at
you
again
.
You
*NL*
are
getting
on
faster
than
you
think
,
and
I
'll
take
lessons
of
you
in
*NL*
true
politeness
,
for
you
've
learned
the
secret
,
I
believe
.
Try
away
,
*NL*
deary
;
you
'll
get
your
reward
some
day
,
and
no
one
will
be
more
*NL*
delighted
than
I
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
later
Amy
did
get
her
reward
,
and
poor
Jo
found
it
hard
to
be
*NL*
delighted
.
A
letter
came
from
Aunt
Carrol
,
and
Mrs.
March
's
face
was
*NL*
illuminated
to
such
a
degree
,
when
she
read
it
,
that
Jo
and
Beth
,
who
*NL*
were
with
her
,
demanded
what
the
glad
tidings
were
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aunt
Carrol
is
going
abroad
next
month
,
and
wants
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
to
go
with
her
!
''
burst
in
Jo
,
flying
out
of
her
chair
in
an
*NL*
uncontrollable
rapture
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
dear
,
not
you
;
it
's
Amy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
mother
!
she
's
too
young
;
it
's
my
turn
first
.
I
've
wanted
it
so
*NL*
long
--
it
would
do
me
so
much
good
,
and
be
so
altogether
splendid
--
I
*NL*
_
must
_
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
's
impossible
,
Jo
.
Aunt
says
Amy
,
decidedly
,
and
it
is
not
*NL*
for
us
to
dictate
when
she
offers
such
a
favor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
always
so
.
Amy
has
all
the
fun
and
I
have
all
the
work
.
It
is
n't
*NL*
fair
,
oh
,
it
is
n't
fair
!
''
cried
Jo
passionately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
is
partly
your
own
fault
,
dear
.
When
Aunt
spoke
to
me
the
*NL*
other
day
,
she
regretted
your
blunt
manners
and
too
independent
spirit
;
*NL*
and
here
she
writes
,
as
if
quoting
something
you
had
said
,
--
'
I
planned
*NL*
at
first
to
ask
Jo
;
but
as
``
favors
burden
her
,
''
and
she
``
hates
French
,
''
*NL*
I
think
I
wo
n't
venture
to
invite
her
.
Amy
is
more
docile
,
will
make
a
*NL*
good
companion
for
Flo
,
and
receive
gratefully
any
help
the
trip
may
*NL*
give
her
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
tongue
,
my
abominable
tongue
!
why
ca
n't
I
learn
to
keep
it
*NL*
quiet
?
''
groaned
Jo
,
remembering
words
which
had
been
her
undoing
.
When
*NL*
she
had
heard
the
explanation
of
the
quoted
phrases
,
Mrs.
March
said
*NL*
sorrowfully
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
could
have
gone
,
but
there
is
no
hope
of
it
this
time
;
so
*NL*
try
to
bear
it
cheerfully
,
and
do
n't
sadden
Amy
's
pleasure
by
reproaches
*NL*
or
regrets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
,
''
said
Jo
,
winking
hard
,
as
she
knelt
down
to
pick
up
the
*NL*
basket
she
had
joyfully
upset
.
``
I
'll
take
a
leaf
out
of
her
book
,
and
*NL*
try
not
only
to
seem
glad
,
but
to
be
so
,
and
not
grudge
her
one
minute
*NL*
of
happiness
;
but
it
wo
n't
be
easy
,
for
it
is
a
dreadful
*NL*
disappointment
;
''
and
poor
Jo
bedewed
the
little
fat
pincushion
she
held
*NL*
with
several
very
bitter
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
dear
,
I
'm
very
selfish
,
but
I
could
n't
spare
you
,
and
I
'm
glad
you
*NL*
are
not
going
quite
yet
,
''
whispered
Beth
,
embracing
her
,
basket
and
all
,
*NL*
with
such
a
clinging
touch
and
loving
face
,
that
Jo
felt
comforted
in
*NL*
spite
of
the
sharp
regret
that
made
her
want
to
box
her
own
ears
,
and
*NL*
humbly
beg
Aunt
Carrol
to
burden
her
with
this
favor
,
and
see
how
*NL*
gratefully
she
would
bear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Amy
came
in
,
Jo
was
able
to
take
her
part
in
the
family
*NL*
jubilation
;
not
quite
as
heartily
as
usual
,
perhaps
,
but
without
*NL*
repinings
at
Amy
's
good
fortune
.
The
young
lady
herself
received
the
*NL*
news
as
tidings
of
great
joy
,
went
about
in
a
solemn
sort
of
rapture
,
*NL*
and
began
to
sort
her
colors
and
pack
her
pencils
that
evening
,
leaving
*NL*
such
trifles
as
clothes
,
money
,
and
passports
to
those
less
absorbed
in
*NL*
visions
of
art
than
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
a
mere
pleasure
trip
to
me
,
girls
,
''
she
said
impressively
,
as
*NL*
she
scraped
her
best
palette
.
``
It
will
decide
my
career
;
for
if
I
have
*NL*
any
genius
,
I
shall
find
it
out
in
Rome
,
and
will
do
something
to
prove
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
you
have
n't
?
''
said
Jo
,
sewing
away
,
with
red
eyes
,
at
the
new
*NL*
collars
which
were
to
be
handed
over
to
Amy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
shall
come
home
and
teach
drawing
for
my
living
,
''
replied
the
*NL*
aspirant
for
fame
,
with
philosophic
composure
;
but
she
made
a
wry
face
*NL*
at
the
prospect
,
and
scratched
away
at
her
palette
as
if
bent
on
*NL*
vigorous
measures
before
she
gave
up
her
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
wo
n't
;
you
hate
hard
work
,
and
you
'll
marry
some
rich
man
,
and
*NL*
come
home
to
sit
in
the
lap
of
luxury
all
your
days
,
''
said
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
predictions
sometimes
come
to
pass
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
that
one
*NL*
will
.
I
'm
sure
I
wish
it
would
,
for
if
I
ca
n't
be
an
artist
myself
,
I
*NL*
should
like
to
be
able
to
help
those
who
are
,
''
said
Amy
,
smiling
,
as
if
*NL*
the
part
of
Lady
Bountiful
would
suit
her
better
than
that
of
a
poor
*NL*
drawing-teacher
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
''
said
Jo
,
with
a
sigh
;
``
if
you
wish
it
you
'll
have
it
,
for
your
*NL*
wishes
are
always
granted
--
mine
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
like
to
go
?
''
asked
Amy
,
thoughtfully
patting
her
nose
with
*NL*
her
knife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rather
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
in
a
year
or
two
I
'll
send
for
you
,
and
we
'll
dig
in
the
Forum
*NL*
for
relics
,
and
carry
out
all
the
plans
we
've
made
so
many
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
I
'll
remind
you
of
your
promise
when
that
joyful
day
comes
,
*NL*
if
it
ever
does
,
''
returned
Jo
,
accepting
the
vague
but
magnificent
offer
*NL*
as
gratefully
as
she
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
not
much
time
for
preparation
,
and
the
house
was
in
a
ferment
*NL*
till
Amy
was
off
.
Jo
bore
up
very
well
till
the
last
flutter
of
blue
*NL*
ribbon
vanished
,
when
she
retired
to
her
refuge
,
the
garret
,
and
cried
*NL*
till
she
could
n't
cry
any
more
.
Amy
likewise
bore
up
stoutly
till
the
*NL*
steamer
sailed
;
then
,
just
as
the
gangway
was
about
to
be
withdrawn
,
it
*NL*
suddenly
came
over
her
that
a
whole
ocean
was
soon
to
roll
between
her
*NL*
and
those
who
loved
her
best
,
and
she
clung
to
Laurie
,
the
last
*NL*
lingerer
,
saying
with
a
sob
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
take
care
of
them
for
me
;
and
if
anything
should
happen
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
dear
,
I
will
;
and
if
anything
happens
,
I
'll
come
and
comfort
*NL*
you
,
''
whispered
Laurie
,
little
dreaming
that
he
would
be
called
upon
to
*NL*
keep
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
Amy
sailed
away
to
find
the
old
world
,
which
is
always
new
and
*NL*
beautiful
to
young
eyes
,
while
her
father
and
friend
watched
her
from
*NL*
the
shore
,
fervently
hoping
that
none
but
gentle
fortunes
would
befall
*NL*
the
happy-hearted
girl
,
who
waved
her
hand
to
them
till
they
could
see
*NL*
nothing
but
the
summer
sunshine
dazzling
on
the
sea

DEAREST

Here
I

It

fashionable
place

uncle
stopped
here

years

Every

Aunt

poorly

liked
to
be
let

alone

so
when
I
had
done
what
I
could
for

I
went
and
*NL*
enjoyed
myself

Such
walks
on
deck

such
sunsets

such
splendid

It
was
almost

exciting

went
rushing
on
so
grandly

I

I
did

She
lives
on
the
banks
of
Killarney

*NL*
From
the
glance
of
her
eye
,
*NL*
Shun
danger
and
fly
,
*NL*
For
fatal
's
the
glance
of
Kate
Kearney

*NL*
*NL*
Was
n't
that
nonsensical
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
only
stopped
at
Liverpool
a
few
hours
.
It
's
a
dirty
,
noisy
*NL*
place
,
and
I
was
glad
to
leave
it
.
Uncle
rushed
out
and
bought
a
*NL*
pair
of
dog-skin
gloves
,
some
ugly
,
thick
shoes
,
and
an
*NL*
umbrella
,
and
got
shaved
_
a
la
_
mutton-chop
,
the
first
thing
.
*NL*
Then
he
flattered
himself
that
he
looked
like
a
true
Briton
;
but
*NL*
the
first
time
he
had
the
mud
cleaned
off
his
shoes
,
the
little
*NL*
bootblack
knew
that
an
American
stood
in
them
,
and
said
,
with
a
*NL*
grin
,
`
There
yer
har
,
sir
.
I
've
give
'em
the
latest
Yankee
*NL*
shine
.
'
It
amused
uncle
immensely
.
Oh
,
I
_
must
_
tell
you
what
*NL*
that
absurd
Lennox
did
!
He
got
his
friend
Ward
,
who
came
on
with
*NL*
us
,
to
order
a
bouquet
for
me
,
and
the
first
thing
I
saw
in
my
*NL*
room
was
a
lovely
one
,
with
`
Robert
Lennox
's
compliments
,
'
on
*NL*
the
card
.
Was
n't
that
fun
,
girls
?
I
like
travelling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
_
shall
_
get
to
London
if
I
do
n't
hurry
.
The
trip
was
*NL*
like
riding
through
a
long
picture-gallery
,
full
of
lovely
*NL*
landscapes
.
The
farmhouses
were
my
delight
;
with
thatched
roofs
,
*NL*
ivy
up
to
the
eaves
,
latticed
windows
,
and
stout
women
with
rosy
*NL*
children
at
the
doors
.
The
very
cattle
looked
more
tranquil
than
*NL*
ours
,
as
they
stood
knee-deep
in
clover
,
and
the
hens
had
a
*NL*
contented
cluck
,
as
if
they
never
got
nervous
,
like
Yankee
*NL*
biddies
.
Such
perfect
color
I
never
saw
,
--
the
grass
so
green
,
*NL*
sky
so
blue
,
grain
so
yellow
,
woods
so
dark
,
--
I
was
in
a
rapture
*NL*
all
the
way
.
So
was
Flo
;
and
we
kept
bouncing
from
one
side
to
*NL*
the
other
,
trying
to
see
everything
while
we
were
whisking
along
*NL*
at
the
rate
of
sixty
miles
an
hour
.
Aunt
was
tired
and
went
to
*NL*
sleep
,
but
uncle
read
his
guide-book
,
and
would
n't
be
astonished
*NL*
at
anything
.
This
is
the
way
we
went
on
:
Amy
,
flying
up
,
--
`
Oh
,
*NL*
that
must
be
Kenilworth
,
that
gray
place
among
the
trees
!
'
Flo
,
*NL*
darting
to
my
window
,
--
`
How
sweet
!
We
must
go
there
some
time
,
*NL*
wo
n't
we
,
papa
?
'
Uncle
,
calmly
admiring
his
boots
,
--
`
No
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
not
unless
you
want
beer
;
that
's
a
brewery
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pause
,
--
then
Flo
cried
out
,
`
Bless
me
,
there
's
a
gallows
and
*NL*
a
man
going
up
.
'
`
Where
,
where
?
'
shrieks
Amy
,
staring
out
at
two
*NL*
tall
posts
with
a
cross-beam
and
some
dangling
chains
.
'
A
*NL*
colliery
,
'
remarks
uncle
,
with
a
twinkle
of
the
eye
.
`
Here
's
a
*NL*
lovely
flock
of
lambs
all
lying
down
,
'
says
Amy
.
`
See
,
papa
,
*NL*
are
n't
they
pretty
!
'
added
Flo
sentimentally
.
`
Geese
,
young
*NL*
ladies
,
'
returns
uncle
,
in
a
tone
that
keeps
us
quiet
till
Flo
*NL*
settles
down
to
enjoy
`
The
Flirtations
of
Capt.
Cavendish
,
'
and
*NL*
I
have
the
scenery
all
to
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
rained
when
we
got
to
London
,
and
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
seen
but
fog
and
umbrellas
.
We
rested
,
unpacked
,
*NL*
and
shopped
a
little
between
the
showers
.
Aunt
Mary
got
me
some
*NL*
new
things
,
for
I
came
off
in
such
a
hurry
I
was
n't
half
ready
.
*NL*
A
white
hat
and
blue
feather
,
a
muslin
dress
to
match
,
and
the
*NL*
loveliest
mantle
you
ever
saw
.
Shopping
in
Regent
Street
is
*NL*
perfectly
splendid
;
things
seem
so
cheap
--
nice
ribbons
only
*NL*
sixpence
a
yard
.
I
laid
in
a
stock
,
but
shall
get
my
gloves
in
*NL*
Paris
.
Does
n't
that
sound
sort
of
elegant
and
rich
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flo
and
I
,
for
the
fun
of
it
,
ordered
a
hansom
cab
,
while
aunt
*NL*
and
uncle
were
out
,
and
went
for
a
drive
,
though
we
learned
*NL*
afterward
that
it
was
n't
the
thing
for
young
ladies
to
ride
in
*NL*
them
alone
.
It
was
so
droll
!
for
when
we
were
shut
in
by
the
*NL*
wooden
apron
,
the
man
drove
so
fast
that
Flo
was
frightened
,
and
*NL*
told
me
to
stop
him
.
But
he
was
up
outside
behind
somewhere
,
and
*NL*
I
could
n't
get
at
him
.
He
did
n't
hear
me
call
,
nor
see
me
flap
*NL*
my
parasol
in
front
,
and
there
we
were
,
quite
helpless
,
rattling
*NL*
away
,
and
whirling
around
corners
at
a
break-neck
pace
.
At
last
,
*NL*
in
my
despair
,
I
saw
a
little
door
in
the
roof
,
and
on
poking
it
*NL*
open
,
a
red
eye
appeared
,
and
a
beery
voice
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Now
then
,
mum
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
gave
my
order
as
soberly
as
I
could
,
and
slamming
down
the
*NL*
door
,
with
an
`
Aye
,
aye
,
mum
,
'
the
man
made
his
horse
walk
,
as
*NL*
if
going
to
a
funeral
.
I
poked
again
,
and
said
,
'
A
little
*NL*
faster
;
'
then
off
he
went
,
helter-skelter
,
as
before
,
and
we
*NL*
resigned
ourselves
to
our
fate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-day
was
fair
and
we
went
to
Hyde
Park
,
close
by
,
for
we
are
*NL*
more
aristocratic
than
we
look
.
The
Duke
of
Devonshire
lives
*NL*
near
.
I
often
see
his
footmen
lounging
at
the
back
gate
;
and
the
*NL*
Duke
of
Wellington
's
house
is
not
far
off
.
Such
sights
as
I
saw
,
*NL*
my
dear
!
It
was
as
good
as
Punch
,
for
there
were
fat
dowagers
*NL*
rolling
about
in
their
red
and
yellow
coaches
,
with
gorgeous
*NL*
Jeameses
in
silk
stockings
and
velvet
coats
,
up
behind
,
and
*NL*
powdered
coachmen
in
front
.
Smart
maids
,
with
the
rosiest
*NL*
children
I
ever
saw
;
handsome
girls
,
looking
half
asleep
;
*NL*
dandies
,
in
queer
English
hats
and
lavender
kids
,
lounging
*NL*
about
,
and
tall
soldiers
,
in
short
red
jackets
and
muffin
caps
*NL*
stuck
on
one
side
,
looking
so
funny
I
longed
to
sketch
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rotten
Row
means
'
_
Route
de
Roi
_
,
'
or
the
king
's
way
;
but
now
*NL*
it
's
more
like
a
riding-school
than
anything
else
.
The
horses
*NL*
are
splendid
,
and
the
men
,
especially
the
grooms
,
ride
well
;
but
*NL*
the
women
are
stiff
,
and
bounce
,
which
is
n't
according
to
our
*NL*
rules
.
I
longed
to
show
them
a
tearing
American
gallop
,
for
they
*NL*
trotted
solemnly
up
and
down
,
in
their
scant
habits
and
high
*NL*
hats
,
looking
like
the
women
in
a
toy
Noah
's
Ark.
.
Every
one
*NL*
rides
,
--
old
men
,
stout
ladies
,
little
children
,
--
and
the
young
*NL*
folks
do
a
deal
of
flirting
here
;
I
saw
a
pair
exchange
*NL*
rosebuds
,
for
it
's
the
thing
to
wear
one
in
the
button-hole
,
and
*NL*
I
thought
it
rather
a
nice
little
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
P.M.
to
Westminster
Abbey

but
do
n't
expect
me
to
*NL*
describe
it

that
's
impossible

so
I
'll
only
say
it
was
sublime
!

This
evening
we
are
going
to
see
Fechter

will

It

very
late

but
I
ca
n't
let
my
letter
go
in
the
morning
*NL*
without
telling
you
what
happened
last
evening
.
Who
do
you
think
*NL*
came
in
,
as
we
were
at
tea
?
Laurie
's
English
friends
,
Fred
and
*NL*
Frank
Vaughn
!
I
was
_
so
_
surprised
,
for
I
should
n't
have
known
*NL*
them
but
for
the
cards
.
Both
are
tall
fellows
,
with
whiskers
;
*NL*
Fred
handsome
in
the
English
style
,
and
Frank
much
better
,
for
*NL*
he
only
limps
slightly
,
and
uses
no
crutches
.
They
had
heard
*NL*
from
Laurie
where
we
were
to
be
,
and
came
to
ask
us
to
their
*NL*
house
;
but
uncle
wo
n't
go
,
so
we
shall
return
the
call
,
and
see
*NL*
them
as
we
can
.
They
went
to
the
theatre
with
us
,
and
we
did
*NL*
have
_
such
_
a
good
time
,
for
Frank
devoted
himself
to
Flo
,
and
*NL*
Fred
and
I
talked
over
past
,
present
,
and
future
fun
as
if
we
*NL*
had
known
each
other
all
our
days
.
Tell
Beth
Frank
asked
for
*NL*
her
,
and
was
sorry
to
hear
of
her
ill
health
.
Fred
laughed
when
*NL*
I
spoke
of
Jo
,
and
sent
his
`
respectful
compliments
to
the
big
*NL*
hat
.
'
Neither
of
them
had
forgotten
Camp
Laurence
,
or
the
fun
we
*NL*
had
there
.
What
ages
ago
it
seems
,
does
n't
it
?

``
Aunt
is
tapping
on
the
wall

the
third

feel
like

here
so
late

DEAR
GIRLS

PARIS

In
my
last
I
told
you
about
our
London
visit
,
--
how
kind
the
*NL*
Vaughns
were
,
and
what
pleasant
parties
they
made
for
us
.
I
*NL*
enjoyed
the
trips
to
Hampton
Court
and
the
Kensington
Museum
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
,
--
for
at
Hampton
I
saw
Raphael
's
*NL*
cartoons
,
and
,
at
the
Museum
,
rooms
full
of
pictures
by
Turner
,
*NL*
Lawrence
,
Reynolds
,
Hogarth
,
and
the
other
great
creatures
.
The
*NL*
day
in
Richmond
Park
was
charming
,
for
we
had
a
regular
English
*NL*
picnic
,
and
I
had
more
splendid
oaks
and
groups
of
deer
than
I
*NL*
could
copy
;
also
heard
a
nightingale
,
and
saw
larks
go
up

We
*NL*
`
did
'
London
to
our
hearts

content

thanks
to
Fred
and
Frank
,
*NL*
and
were
sorry
to
go
away
;
for
,
though
English
people
are
slow
*NL*
to
take
you
in

when
they
once
make
up
their
minds
to
do
it
they
*NL*
can
not
be
outdone
in
hospitality
,
_
I
_
think
.
The
Vaughns
hope
to
*NL*
meet
us
in
Rome
next
winter
,
and
I
shall
be
dreadfully
*NL*
disappointed
if
they
do
n't
,
for
Grace
and
I
are
great
friends
,
*NL*

the
boys
very
nice
fellows

Fred

*NL*
``
Well

we
were
hardly
settled
here

when
he
turned
up
again

*NL*
saying
he
had
come
for
a
holiday
,
and
was
going
to
Switzerland

*NL*
Aunt
looked
sober
at
first
,
but
he
was
so
cool
about
it
she
*NL*
could
n't
say
a
word
;
and
now
we
get
on
nicely
,
and
are
very
glad
*NL*
he
came
,
for
he
speaks
French
like
a
native
,
and
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
we
should
do
without
him
.
Uncle
does
n't
know
ten
words
,
and
*NL*
insists
on
talking
English
very
loud
,
as
if
that
would
make
*NL*
people
understand
him

Aunt
's
pronunciation
is
old-fashioned

Flo
and
I
,
though
we
flattered
ourselves
that
we
knew
a
good

deal

very
grateful

Rainy
*NL*
days
I
spend
in
the
Louvre
,
revelling
in
pictures

Jo
would
turn
*NL*
up
her
naughty
nose
at
some
of
the
finest
,
because
she
has
no

soul
for
art

_
I
_
have
,
and
I
'm
cultivating
eye

taste

*NL*
fast
as
I
can

She
would
like
the
relics
of
great

better

seen
her
Napoleon

cocked

gray
coat

Pere

very

many
of

are

Our

sitting

we
look
up

down
the
long

It
is
*NL*
so
pleasant

we
spend
our

too
*NL*
tired

is
altogether
the
most
agreeable
young

Laurie

I

the
Vaughns

very

come

Having
a
quiet
hour
before
we
leave
for
Berne
,
I
'll
try
to
tell
*NL*
you
what
has

some

The
sail
up
the
Rhine
was
perfect
,
and
I
just
sat
and
enjoyed
*NL*
it
with
all
my
might
.
Get
father
's
old
guide-books
,
and
read
*NL*
about
it
;
I
have
n't
words
beautiful
enough
to
describe
it
.
At
*NL*
Coblentz
we
had
a
lovely
time
,
for
some
students
from
Bonn
,
with
*NL*
whom
Fred
got
acquainted
on
the
boat
,
gave
us
a
serenade
.
It
was
*NL*
a
moonlight
night
,
and
,
about
one
o'clock
,
Flo
and
I
were
waked
*NL*
by
the
most
delicious
music
under
our
windows
.
We
flew
up
,
and
*NL*
hid
behind
the
curtains
;
but
sly
peeps
showed
us
Fred
and
the
*NL*
students
singing
away
down
below
.
It
was
the
most
romantic
thing
*NL*
I
ever
saw
,
--
the
river
,
the
bridge
of
boats
,
the
great
fortress
*NL*
opposite
,
moonlight
everywhere
,
and
music
fit
to
melt
a
heart
of
*NL*
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
they
were
done
we
threw
down
some
flowers
,
and
saw
them
*NL*
scramble
for
them
,
kiss
their
hands
to
the
invisible
ladies
,
and
*NL*
go
laughing
away
,
--
to
smoke
and
drink
beer
,
I
suppose
.
Next
*NL*
morning
Fred
showed
me
one
of
the
crumpled
flowers
in
his
*NL*
vest-pocket
,
and
looked
very
sentimental
.
I
laughed
at
him
,
and
*NL*
said
I
did
n't
throw
it
,
but
Flo
,
which
seemed
to
disgust
him
,
*NL*
for
he
tossed
it
out
of
the
window
,
and
turned
sensible
again
.
*NL*
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
going
to
have
trouble
with
that
boy
,
it
begins
to
*NL*
look
like
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
baths
at
Nassau
were
very
gay
,
so
was
Baden-Baden
,
where
*NL*
Fred
lost
some
money
,
and
I
scolded
him
.
He
needs
some
one
to
*NL*
look
after
him
when
Frank
is
not
with
him
.
Kate
said
once
she
*NL*
hoped
he
'd
marry
soon
,
and
I
quite
agree
with
her
that
it
would
*NL*
be
well
for
him
.
Frankfort
was
delightful
;
I
saw
Goethe
's
house
,
*NL*
Schiller
's
statue
,
and
Dannecker
's
famous
`
Ariadne
.
'
It
was
very
*NL*
lovely
,
but
I
should
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
I
had
known
the
*NL*
story
better
.
I
did
n't
like
to
ask
,
as
every
one
knew
it
,
or
*NL*
pretended
they
did
.
I
wish
Jo
would
tell
me
all
about
it
;
I
*NL*
ought
to
have
read
more
,
for
I
find
I
do
n't
know
anything
,
and
*NL*
it
mortifies
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
comes
the
serious
part
,
--
for
it
happened
here
,
and
Fred
is
*NL*
just
gone
.
He
has
been
so
kind
and
jolly
that
we
all
got
quite
*NL*
fond
of
him
;
I
never
thought
of
anything
but
a
travelling
*NL*
friendship
,
till
the
serenade
night
.
Since
then
I
've
begun
to
*NL*
feel
that
the
moonlight
walks
,
balcony
talks
,
and
daily
*NL*
adventures
were
something
more
to
him
than
fun
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
flirted
,
mother
,
truly
,
but
remembered
what
you
said
to
me
,
and
*NL*
have
done
my
very
best
.
I
ca
n't
help
it
if
people
like
me
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
try
to
make
them
,
and
it
worries
me
if
I
do
n't
care
for
*NL*
them
,
though
Jo
says
I
have
n't
got
any
heart
.
Now
I
know
mother
*NL*
will
shake
her
head
,
and
the
girls
say
,
`
Oh
,
the
mercenary
*NL*
little
wretch
!
'
but
I
've
made
up
my
mind
,
and
,
if
Fred
asks
me
,
*NL*
I
shall
accept
him
,
though
I
'm
not
madly
in
love
.
I
like
him
,
*NL*
and
we
get
on
comfortably
together
.
He
is
handsome
,
young
,
*NL*
clever
enough
,
and
very
rich
,
--
ever
so
much
richer
than
the
*NL*
Laurences
.
I
do
n't
think
his
family
would
object
,
and
I
should
*NL*
be
very
happy
,
for
they
are
all
kind
,
well-bred
,
generous
*NL*
people
,
and
they
like
me
.
Fred
,
as
the
eldest
twin
,
will
have
*NL*
the
estate
,
I
suppose
,
and
such
a
splendid
one
as
it
is
!
A
city
*NL*
house
in
a
fashionable
street
,
not
so
showy
as
our
big
houses
,
*NL*
but
twice
as
comfortable
,
and
full
of
solid
luxury
,
such
as
*NL*
English
people
believe
in
.
I
like
it
,
for
it
's
genuine
.
I
've
*NL*
seen
the
plate
,
the
family
jewels
,
the
old
servants
,
and
*NL*
pictures
of
the
country
place
,
with
its
park
,
great
house
,
*NL*
lovely
grounds
,
and
fine
horses
.
Oh
,
it
would
be
all
I
should
*NL*
ask
!
and
I
'd
rather
have
it
than
any
title
such
as
girls
snap
up
*NL*
so
readily
,
and
find
nothing
behind
.
I
may
be
mercenary
,
but
I
*NL*
hate
poverty
,
and
do
n't
mean
to
bear
it
a
minute
longer
than
I
*NL*
can
help
.
One
of
us
_
must
_
marry
well
;
Meg
did
n't
,
Jo
wo
n't
,
*NL*
Beth
ca
n't
yet
,
so
I
shall
,
and
make
everything
cosey
all
round
.
*NL*
I
would
n't
marry
a
man
I
hated
or
despised
.
You
may
be
sure
of
*NL*
that
;
and
,
though
Fred
is
not
my
model
hero
,
he
does
very
well
,
*NL*
and
,
in
time
,
I
should
get
fond
enough
of
him
if
he
was
very
*NL*
fond
of
me
,
and
let
me
do
just
as
I
liked
.
So
I
've
been
turning
*NL*
the
matter
over
in
my
mind
the
last
week
,
for
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
help
seeing
that
Fred
liked
me
.
He
said
nothing
,
but
little
*NL*
things
showed
it
;
he
never
goes
with
Flo
,
always
gets
on
my
side
*NL*
of
the
carriage
,
table
,
or
promenade
,
looks
sentimental
when
we
*NL*
are
alone
,
and
frowns
at
any
one
else
who
ventures
to
speak
to
*NL*
me
.
Yesterday
,
at
dinner
,
when
an
Austrian
officer
stared
at
us
,
*NL*
and
then
said
something
to
his
friend
,
--
a
rakish-looking
*NL*
baron
,
--
about
'
_
ein
wonderschoenes
Bloendchen
_
,
'
Fred
looked
as
*NL*
fierce
as
a
lion
,
and
cut
his
meat
so
savagely
,
it
nearly
flew
*NL*
off
his
plate
.
He
is
n't
one
of
the
cool
,
stiff
Englishmen
,
but
*NL*
is
rather
peppery
,
for
he
has
Scotch
blood
in
him
,
as
one
might
*NL*
guess
from
his
bonnie
blue
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
last
evening
we
went
up
to
the
castle
about
sunset
,
--
at
*NL*
least
all
of
us
but
Fred
,
who
was
to
meet
us
there
,
after
going
*NL*
to
the
Post
Restante
for
letters
.
We
had
a
charming
time
poking
*NL*
about
the
ruins
,
the
vaults
where
the
monster
tun
is
,
and
the
*NL*
beautiful
gardens
made
by
the
elector
,
long
ago
,
for
his
English
*NL*
wife
.
I
liked
the
great
terrace
best
,
for
the
view
was
divine
;
*NL*
so
,
while
the
rest
went
to
see
the
rooms
inside
,
I
sat
there
*NL*
trying
to
sketch
the
gray
stone
lion
's
head
on
the
wall
,
with
*NL*
scarlet
woodbine
sprays
hanging
round
it
.
I
felt
as
if
I
'd
got
*NL*
into
a
romance
,
sitting
there
,
watching
the
Neckar
rolling
*NL*
through
the
valley
,
listening
to
the
music
of
the
Austrian
band
*NL*
below
,
and
waiting
for
my
lover
,
like
a
real
story-book
girl
.
I
*NL*
had
a
feeling
that
something
was
going
to
happen
,
and
I
was
*NL*
ready
for
it
.
I
did
n't
feel
blushy
or
quakey
,
but
quite
cool
,
*NL*
and
only
a
little
excited
.

By
and
by
I
heard
Fred
's
voice
,
and
then
he
came
hurrying
*NL*
through
the
great
arch
to
find
me
.
He
looked
so
troubled
that
I
*NL*
forgot
all
about
myself
,
and
asked
what
the
matter
was
.
He
said
*NL*
he
'd
just
got
a
letter
begging
him
to
come
home
,
for
Frank
was
*NL*
very
ill
;
so
he
was
going
at
once
,
in
the
night
train
,
and
only
*NL*
had
time
to
say
good-by
.
I
was
very
sorry
for
him
,
and
*NL*
disappointed
for
myself
,
but
only
for
a
minute
,
because
he
*NL*
said
,
as
he
shook
hands
,
--
and
said
it
in
a
way
that
I
could
not
*NL*
mistake
,

I
shall
soon
come
back

you
wo

*NL*
``
I
did
n't
promise
,
but
I
looked
at
him
,
and
he
seemed
satisfied
,
*NL*
and
there
was
no
time
for
anything
but
messages
and
good-byes
,
*NL*
for
he
was
off
in
an
hour
,
and
we
all
miss
him
very
much
.
I
know
*NL*
he
wanted
to
speak
,
but
I
think
,
from
something
he
once
hinted
,
*NL*
that
he
had
promised
his
father
not
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
*NL*
yet
awhile
,
for
he
is
a
rash
boy
,
and
the
old
gentleman
dreads
a
*NL*
foreign
daughter-in-law
.
We
shall
soon
meet
in
Rome
;
and
then
,
*NL*
if
I
do
n't
change
my
mind
,
I
'll
say

Yes

thank
you

all

she
is
growing
up

begins
to
dream
dreams

have
*NL*
hopes

fears

fidgets

without
knowing
why

being
able
to
*NL*
explain
them

Why

mother

Beth

eighteen
,
but
we
do

it

treat
her

she
's
a
woman

*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
is

Dear
heart
,
how
fast
you
do
grow
up

''
returned
her
mother
,
*NL*
with
a
sigh
and
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
be
helped

so
you
must
resign
yourself
to
all

let
your
birds
hop
out
of
the
nest
,
one
by

I
promise

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is

Jo

is
gone

Beth
is

feeble

*NL*
``

''
and
Jo
stitched
away
,
with
a
wise
nod
*NL*
which
set
her
mother
's
heart
at
rest
about
her
,
for
the
present
at
*NL*
least
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
apparently
absorbed
in
her
own
affairs
,
Jo
watched
Beth
;
and
,
*NL*
after
many
conflicting
conjectures
,
finally
settled
upon
one
which
*NL*
seemed
to
explain
the
change
in
her
.
A
slight
incident
gave
Jo
the
clue
*NL*
to
the
mystery
,
she
thought
,
and
lively
fancy
,
loving
heart
did
the
*NL*
rest
.
She
was
affecting
to
write
busily
one
Saturday
afternoon
,
when
she
*NL*
and
Beth
were
alone
together
;
yet
as
she
scribbled
,
she
kept
her
eye
on
*NL*
her
sister
,
who
seemed
unusually
quiet
.
Sitting
at
the
window
,
Beth
's
*NL*
work
often
dropped
into
her
lap
,
and
she
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hand
,
*NL*
in
a
dejected
attitude
,
while
her
eyes
rested
on
the
dull
,
autumnal
*NL*
landscape
.
Suddenly
some
one
passed
below
,
whistling
like
an
operatic
*NL*
blackbird
,
and
a
voice
called
out
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

She
leaned
her
head
upon
her
hands
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
serene
!
Coming
in
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
started
,
leaned
forward
,
smiled
and
nodded
,
watched
the
passer-by
*NL*
till
his
quick
tramp
died
away
,
then
said
softly
,
as
if
to
herself
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
strong
and
well
and
happy
that
dear
boy
looks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hum
!
''
said
Jo
,
still
intent
upon
her
sister
's
face
;
for
the
bright
*NL*
color
faded
as
quickly
as
it
came
,
the
smile
vanished
,
and
presently
a
*NL*
tear
lay
shining
on
the
window-ledge
.
Beth
whisked
it
off
,
and
glanced
*NL*
apprehensively
at
Jo
;
but
she
was
scratching
away
at
a
tremendous
rate
,
*NL*
apparently
engrossed
in
``
Olympia
's
Oath
.
''
The
instant
Beth
turned
,
Jo
*NL*
began
her
watch
again
,
saw
Beth
's
hand
go
quietly
to
her
eyes
more
than
*NL*
once
,
and
,
in
her
half-averted
face
,
read
a
tender
sorrow
that
made
her
*NL*
own
eyes
fill
.
Fearing
to
betray
herself
,
she
slipped
away
,
murmuring
*NL*
something
about
needing
more
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
me
,
Beth
loves
Laurie
!
''
she
said
,
sitting
down
in
her
own
*NL*
room
,
pale
with
the
shock
of
the
discovery
which
she
believed
she
had
*NL*
just
made
.
``
I
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
.
What
_
will
_
mother
say
?
I
*NL*
wonder
if
he
--
''
there
Jo
stopped
,
and
turned
scarlet
with
a
sudden
*NL*
thought
.
``
If
he
should
n't
love
back
again
,
how
dreadful
it
would
be
.
He
*NL*
must
;
I
'll
make
him
!
''
and
she
shook
her
head
threateningly
at
the
*NL*
picture
of
the
mischievous-looking
boy
laughing
at
her
from
the
wall
.
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
we
_
are
_
growing
up
with
a
vengeance
.
Here
's
Meg
married
and
a
*NL*
mamma
,
Amy
flourishing
away
at
Paris
,
and
Beth
in
love
.
I
'm
the
only
one
*NL*
that
has
sense
enough
to
keep
out
of
mischief
.
''
Jo
thought
intently
for
*NL*
a
minute
,
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
picture
;
then
she
smoothed
out
her
*NL*
wrinkled
forehead
,
and
said
,
with
a
decided
nod
at
the
face
opposite
,
*NL*
``
No
,
thank
you
,
sir
;
you
're
very
charming
,
but
you
've
no
more
stability
*NL*
than
a
weathercock
;
so
you
need
n't
write
touching
notes
,
and
smile
in
*NL*
that
insinuating
way
,
for
it
wo
n't
do
a
bit
of
good
,
and
I
wo
n't
have
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
sighed
,
and
fell
into
a
reverie
,
from
which
she
did
not
wake
*NL*
till
the
early
twilight
sent
her
down
to
take
new
observations
,
which
*NL*
only
confirmed
her
suspicion
.
Though
Laurie
flirted
with
Amy
and
joked
*NL*
with
Jo
,
his
manner
to
Beth
had
always
been
peculiarly
kind
and
gentle
,
*NL*
but
so
was
everybody
's
;
therefore
,
no
one
thought
of
imagining
that
he
*NL*
cared
more
for
her
than
for
the
others
.
Indeed
,
a
general
impression
had
*NL*
prevailed
in
the
family
,
of
late
,
that
``
our
boy
''
was
getting
fonder
than
*NL*
ever
of
Jo
,
who
,
however
,
would
n't
hear
a
word
upon
the
subject
,
and
*NL*
scolded
violently
if
any
one
dared
to
suggest
it
.
If
they
had
known
the
*NL*
various
tender
passages
of
the
past
year
,
or
rather
attempts
at
tender
*NL*
passages
which
had
been
nipped
in
the
bud
,
they
would
have
had
the
*NL*
immense
satisfaction
of
saying
,
``
I
told
you
so
.
''
But
Jo
hated
*NL*
``
philandering
,
''
and
would
n't
allow
it
,
always
having
a
joke
or
a
smile
*NL*
ready
at
the
least
sign
of
impending
danger
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Laurie
first
went
to
college
,
he
fell
in
love
about
once
a
month
;
*NL*
but
these
small
flames
were
as
brief
as
ardent
,
did
no
damage
,
and
much
*NL*
amused
Jo
,
who
took
great
interest
in
the
alternations
of
hope
,
despair
,
*NL*
and
resignation
,
which
were
confided
to
her
in
their
weekly
*NL*
conferences
.
But
there
came
a
time
when
Laurie
ceased
to
worship
at
many
*NL*
shrines
,
hinted
darkly
at
one
all-absorbing
passion
,
and
indulged
*NL*
occasionally
in
Byronic
fits
of
gloom
.
Then
he
avoided
the
tender
*NL*
subject
altogether
,
wrote
philosophical
notes
to
Jo
,
turned
studious
,
*NL*
and
gave
out
that
he
was
going
to
``
dig
,
''
intending
to
graduate
in
a
*NL*
blaze
of
glory
.
This
suited
the
young
lady
better
than
twilight
*NL*
confidences
,
tender
pressures
of
the
hand
,
and
eloquent
glances
of
the
*NL*
eye
;
for
with
Jo
,
brain
developed
earlier
than
heart
,
and
she
preferred
*NL*
imaginary
heroes
to
real
ones
,
because
,
when
tired
of
them
,
the
former
*NL*
could
be
shut
up
in
the
tin-kitchen
till
called
for
,
and
the
latter
were
*NL*
less
manageable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Things
were
in
this
state
when
the
grand
discovery
was
made
,
and
Jo
*NL*
watched
Laurie
that
night
as
she
had
never
done
before
.
If
she
had
not
*NL*
got
the
new
idea
into
her
head
,
she
would
have
seen
nothing
unusual
in
*NL*
the
fact
that
Beth
was
very
quiet
,
and
Laurie
very
kind
to
her
.
But
*NL*
having
given
the
rein
to
her
lively
fancy
,
it
galloped
away
with
her
at
*NL*
a
great
pace
;
and
common
sense
,
being
rather
weakened
by
a
long
course
*NL*
of
romance
writing
,
did
not
come
to
the
rescue
.
As
usual
,
Beth
lay
on
*NL*
the
sofa
,
and
Laurie
sat
in
a
low
chair
close
by
,
amusing
her
with
all
*NL*
sorts
of
gossip
;
for
she
depended
on
her
weekly
``
spin
,
''
and
he
never
*NL*
disappointed
her
.
But
that
evening
,
Jo
fancied
that
Beth
's
eyes
rested
*NL*
on
the
lively
,
dark
face
beside
her
with
peculiar
pleasure
,
and
that
she
*NL*
listened
with
intense
interest
to
an
account
of
some
exciting
*NL*
cricket-match
,
though
the
phrases
,
``
caught
off
a
tice
,
''
``
stumped
off
his
*NL*
ground
,
''
and
``
the
leg
hit
for
three
,
''
were
as
intelligible
to
her
as
*NL*
Sanscrit
.
She
also
fancied
,
having
set
her
heart
upon
seeing
it
,
that
*NL*
she
saw
a
certain
increase
of
gentleness
in
Laurie
's
manner
,
that
he
*NL*
dropped
his
voice
now
and
then
,
laughed
less
than
usual
,
was
a
little
*NL*
absent-minded
,
and
settled
the
afghan
over
Beth
's
feet
with
an
assiduity
*NL*
that
was
really
almost
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
knows
?
stranger
things
have
happened
,
''
thought
Jo
,
as
she
fussed
*NL*
about
the
room
.
``
She
will
make
quite
an
angel
of
him
,
and
he
will
make
*NL*
life
delightfully
easy
and
pleasant
for
the
dear
,
if
they
only
love
each
*NL*
other
.
I
do
n't
see
how
he
can
help
it
;
and
I
do
believe
he
would
if
the
*NL*
rest
of
us
were
out
of
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
every
one
_
was
_
out
of
the
way
but
herself
,
Jo
began
to
feel
that
*NL*
she
ought
to
dispose
of
herself
with
all
speed
.
But
where
should
she
go
?
*NL*
and
burning
to
lay
herself
upon
the
shrine
of
sisterly
devotion
,
she
sat
*NL*
down
to
settle
that
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
the
old
sofa
was
a
regular
patriarch
of
a
sofa
,
--
long
,
broad
,
*NL*
well-cushioned
,
and
low
;
a
trifle
shabby
,
as
well
it
might
be
,
for
the
*NL*
girls
had
slept
and
sprawled
on
it
as
babies
,
fished
over
the
back
,
rode
*NL*
on
the
arms
,
and
had
menageries
under
it
as
children
,
and
rested
tired
*NL*
heads
,
dreamed
dreams
,
and
listened
to
tender
talk
on
it
as
young
women
.
*NL*
They
all
loved
it
,
for
it
was
a
family
refuge
,
and
one
corner
had
always
*NL*
been
Jo
's
favorite
lounging-place
.
Among
the
many
pillows
that
adorned
*NL*
the
venerable
couch
was
one
,
hard
,
round
,
covered
with
prickly
*NL*
horsehair
,
and
furnished
with
a
knobby
button
at
each
end
;
this
*NL*
repulsive
pillow
was
her
especial
property
,
being
used
as
a
weapon
of
*NL*
defence
,
a
barricade
,
or
a
stern
preventive
of
too
much
slumber
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
knew
this
pillow
well
,
and
had
cause
to
regard
it
with
deep
*NL*
aversion
,
having
been
unmercifully
pummelled
with
it
in
former
days
,
*NL*
when
romping
was
allowed
,
and
now
frequently
debarred
by
it
from
taking
*NL*
the
seat
he
most
coveted
,
next
to
Jo
in
the
sofa
corner
.
If
``
the
*NL*
sausage
''
as
they
called
it
,
stood
on
end
,
it
was
a
sign
that
he
might
*NL*
approach
and
repose
;
but
if
it
lay
flat
across
the
sofa
,
woe
to
the
man
,
*NL*
woman
,
or
child
who
dared
disturb
it
!
That
evening
Jo
forgot
to
*NL*
barricade
her
corner
,
and
had
not
been
in
her
seat
five
minutes
,
before
*NL*
a
massive
form
appeared
beside
her
,
and
,
with
both
arms
spread
over
the
*NL*
sofa-back
,
both
long
legs
stretched
out
before
him
,
Laurie
exclaimed
,
*NL*
with
a
sigh
of
satisfaction
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
_
this
_
is
filling
at
the
price

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
slang
,
''
snapped
Jo
,
slamming
down
the
pillow
.
But
it
was
too
late
,
*NL*
there
was
no
room
for
it
;
and
,
coasting
on
to
the
floor
,
it
disappeared
*NL*
in
a
most
mysterious
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
Jo
,
do
n't
be
thorny
.
After
studying
himself
to
a
skeleton
all
the
*NL*
week

and
ought
to
get
it

``

``

*NL*
*NL*
Anything
more
wheedlesome
than
that
touching
appeal
was
seldom
heard
,
*NL*
but
Jo
quenched
``
her
boy
''
by
turning
on
him
with
the
stern
query
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

continued
*NL*
Jo
reprovingly
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*

As
I

I
'll
*NL*
merely
say
that
I
do

see
any
harm
in
that
pleasant
little
game

*NL*
``
Well

it
does
look
pleasant

I

learn
how

tried

feels
awkward
in

not

*NL*
*NL*
``
Take

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
does
it
very
prettily

and
never
seems
to
go
too
far

I
*NL*
suppose
it
's
natural
to
some
people
to
please
without
trying
,
and
others
*NL*
to
always
say
and
do
the
wrong
thing
in
the
wrong
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you

it
's
really
refreshing
to
see
a
sensible

*NL*
straightforward
girl
,
who
can
be
jolly
and
kind
without
making
a
fool
of
*NL*
herself

Between
ourselves

Jo
,
some
of
the
girls
I
know
really
do
go
on
*NL*
at
such
a
rate
I
'm
ashamed
of
them

They
do
n't
mean
any
harm
,
I
'm
sure
;
*NL*
but
if
they
knew
how
we
fellows
talked
about
them
afterward

they
'd
mend
*NL*
their
ways
,
I
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
the
same
;
and
,
as
their
tongues
are
the
sharpest
,
you
fellows
*NL*
get
the
worst
of
it
,
for
you
are
as
silly
as
they
,
every
bit

If
you
*NL*
behaved
properly
,
they
would
;
but
,
knowing
you
like
their
nonsense
,
they
*NL*
keep
it
up
,
and
then
you
blame
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
you
know
about
it
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Laurie
,
in
a
superior
tone
.
``
We
*NL*
do
n't
like
romps

we
may
act

*NL*
The
pretty

modest

never
talked
about

respectfully

among

Bless
your

soul

If
you
could
be
in

for

you

things

would
astonish
you
a

Upon
my
*NL*
word

when
I
see
one
of
those
harum-scarum

I
always
want
to

with

friend
Cock
Robin

`
Out

upon
you

Bold-faced

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
help
laughing
at
the
funny
conflict
between
*NL*
Laurie
's
chivalrous
reluctance
to
speak
ill
of
womankind
,
and
his
very
*NL*
natural
dislike
of
the
unfeminine
folly
of
which
fashionable
society
*NL*
showed
him
many
samples
.
Jo
knew
that
``
young
Laurence
''
was
regarded
as
a
*NL*
most
eligible
_
parti
_
by
worldly
mammas
,
was
much
smiled
upon
by
their
*NL*
daughters
,
and
flattered
enough
by
ladies
of
all
ages
to
make
a
coxcomb
*NL*
of
him
;
so
she
watched
him
rather
jealously
,
fearing
he
would
be
spoilt
,
*NL*
and
rejoiced
more
than
she
confessed
to
find
that
he
still
believed
in
*NL*
modest
girls
.
Returning
suddenly
to
her
admonitory
tone
,
she
said
,
*NL*
dropping
her
voice
,
``
If
you
_
must
_
have
a

went

Teddy
,
go
and
devote
*NL*
yourself
to
one
of
the
`
pretty

modest
girls

whom
you
do
respect
,
and
*NL*
not
waste
your
time
with
the
silly
ones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
really
advise
it
?
''
and
Laurie
looked
at
her
with
an
odd
mixture
of
*NL*
anxiety
and
merriment
in
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
do
;
but
you
'd
better
wait
till
you
are
through

on
the

whole
,
and
be
fitting
yourself
for
the
place
meantime
.
You
're
not
half
*NL*
good
enough
for

well
,
whoever
the
modest
girl
maybe
,
''
and
Jo
looked
a
*NL*
little
queer
likewise
,
for
a
name
had
almost
escaped
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
'm
not
!
''
acquiesced
Laurie
,
with
an
expression
of
humility
quite
*NL*
new
to
him
,
as
he
dropped
his
eyes
,
and
absently
wound
Jo
's
apron-tassel
*NL*
round
his
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
,
this
will
never
do
,
''
thought
Jo
;
adding
aloud
,
``
Go
and
*NL*
sing
to
me
.
I
'm
dying
for
some
music
,
and
always
like
yours

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
rather
stay
here

thank
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

you
ca
n't

there
is

room

Go
and
make
yourself
useful
,
since
*NL*
you
are
too
big
to
be
ornamental
.
I
thought
you
hated
to
be
tied
to
a
*NL*
woman
's
apron-string
?
''
retorted
Jo
,
quoting
certain
rebellious
words
of
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
that
depends
on
who
wears
the
apron
!
''
and
Laurie
gave
an
audacious
*NL*
tweak
at
the
tassel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
?
''
demanded
Jo
,
diving
for
the
pillow
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fled
at
once
,
and
the
minute
it
was
well
``
Up
with
the
bonnets
of
*NL*
bonnie
Dundee
,
''
she
slipped
away
,
to
return
no
more
till
the
young
*NL*
gentleman
had
departed
in
high
dudgeon
.

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
lay
long
awake
that
night
,
and
was
just
dropping
off
when
the
sound
*NL*
of
a
stifled
sob
made
her
fly
to
Beth
's
bedside
,
with
the
anxious
*NL*
inquiry
,
``
What
is
it
,
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
were
asleep

''
sobbed
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
the
old
pain
,
my
precious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
it
's
a
new
one
;
but
I
can
bear
it
,
''
and
Beth
tried
to
check
her
*NL*
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
all
about
it
,
and
let
me
cure
it
as
I
often
did
the
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
;
there
is
no
cure
.
''
There
Beth
's
voice
gave
way
,
and
,
*NL*
clinging
to
her
sister
,
she
cried
so
despairingly
that
Jo
was
*NL*
frightened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
it
?
Shall
I
call
mother
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
did
not
answer
the
first
question
;
but
in
the
dark
one
hand
went
*NL*
involuntarily
to
her
heart
,
as
if
the
pain
were
there
;
with
the
other
*NL*
she
held
Jo
fast
,
whispering
eagerly
,
``
No
,
no
,
do
n't
call
her
,
do
n't
*NL*
tell
her
.
I
shall
be
better
soon
.
Lie
down
here
and
`
poor
'
my
head
.
I
'll
*NL*
be
quiet
,
and
go
to
sleep
;
indeed
I
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
obeyed
;
but
as
her
hand
went
softly
to
and
fro
across
Beth
's
hot
*NL*
forehead
and
wet
eyelids
,
her
heart
was
very
full
,
and
she
longed
to
*NL*
speak
.
But
young
as
she
was
,
Jo
had
learned
that
hearts
,
like
flowers
,
*NL*
can
not
be
rudely
handled
,
but
must
open
naturally
;
so
,
though
she
*NL*
believed
she
knew
the
cause
of
Beth
's
new
pain
,
she
only
said
,
in
her
*NL*
tenderest
tone
,
``
Does
anything
trouble
you
,
deary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Jo
,
''
after
a
long
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
it
comfort
you
to
tell
me
what
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
now
,
not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
wo
n't
ask
;
but
remember
,
Bethy
,
that
mother
and
Jo
are
always
*NL*
glad
to
hear
and
help
you
,
if
they
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
I
'll
tell
you
by
and
by

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
pain
better
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
much
better
;
you
are
so
comfortable
,
Jo
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
to
sleep
,
dear
;
I
'll
stay
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
cheek
to
cheek
they
fell
asleep
,
and
on
the
morrow
Beth
seemed
quite
*NL*
herself
again
;
for
at
eighteen
,
neither
heads
nor
hearts
ache
long
,
and
*NL*
a
loving
word
can
medicine
most
ills
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jo
had
made
up
her
mind
,
and
,
after
pondering
over
a
project
for
*NL*
some
days
,
she
confided
it
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
asked
me
the
other
day
what
my
wishes
were
.
I
'll
tell
you
one
of
*NL*
them

Marmee
,
''
she
began
,
as
they
sat
alone
together
.
``
I
want
to
go
away
*NL*
somewhere
this
winter
for
a
change
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Jo
?
''
and
her
mother
looked
up
quickly
,
as
if
the
words
suggested
a
*NL*
double
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
eyes
on
her
work
,
Jo
answered
soberly
,
``
I
want
something
new
;
I
*NL*
feel
restless
,
and
anxious
to
be
seeing
,
doing
,
and
learning
more
than
I
*NL*
am
.
I
brood
too
much
over
my
own
small
affairs
,
and
need
stirring
up
,
*NL*
so
,
as
I
can
be
spared
this
winter

I
'd
like
to
hop
a
little
way

try
my
wings

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
will
you
hop
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
New
York

I
had
a
bright
idea
yesterday
,
and
this
is
it
.
You
know
*NL*
Mrs.
Kirke
wrote
to
you
for
some
respectable
young
person
to
teach
her
*NL*
children
and
sew
.
It
's
rather
hard
to
find
just
the
thing
,
but
I
think
I
*NL*
should
suit
if
I
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
go
out
to
service
in
that
great
boarding-house
!
''
and
Mrs.
*NL*
March
looked
surprised
,
but
not
displeased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
exactly
going
out
to
service
;
for
Mrs.
Kirke
is
your

friend

the
kindest
soul
that
ever
lived

and
would
make
things

pleasant
for
me
,
I
know

Her
family
is
separate
from
the
rest

and
no
*NL*
one
knows
me
there

Do
n't
care
if
they
do

it
's
honest
work

I
'm
not
*NL*
ashamed

it

*NL*
``
Nor
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
All

even
if
I

up

down

said
slowly

with
sudden
color
in

her
cheeks

put

Mrs.

would
wonder
at
your
want

she
knew

she

*NL*
rejoice

still
may

*NL*
``
Ah
,
Jo
,
mothers
may
differ
in
their
management
,
but
the
hope
is
the
*NL*
same
in
all
,
--
the
desire
to
see
their
children
happy
.
Meg
is
so
,
and
I
*NL*
am
content
with
her
success
.
You
I
leave
to
enjoy
your
liberty
till
you
*NL*
tire
of
it
;
for
only
then
will
you
find
that
there
is
something
sweeter
.
*NL*
Amy
is
my
chief
care
now
,
but
her
good
sense
will
help
her
.
For
Beth
,
I
*NL*
indulge
no
hopes
except
that
she
may
be
well
.
By
the
way
,
she
seems
*NL*
brighter
this
last
day
or
two
.
Have
you
spoken
to
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
she
owned
she
had
a
trouble
,
and
promised
to
tell
me
by
and
by
.
I
*NL*
said
no
more
,
for
I
think
I
know
it
;
''
and
Jo
told
her
little
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
March
shook
her
head
,
and
did
not
take
so
romantic
a
view
of
the
*NL*
case
,
but
looked
grave
,
and
repeated
her
opinion
that
,
for
Laurie
's
*NL*
sake
,
Jo
should
go
away
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
say
nothing
about
it
to
him
till
the
plan
is
settled
;
then
I
'll
*NL*
run
away
before
he
can
collect
his
wits
and
be
tragical
.
Beth
must
think
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
please
myself
,
as
I
am
,
for
I
ca
n't
talk
about
Laurie
to
*NL*
her
;
but
she
can
pet
and
comfort
him
after
I
'm
gone
,
and
so
cure
him
of
*NL*
this
romantic
notion
.
He
's
been
through
so
many
little
trials
of
the
*NL*
sort
,
he
's
used
to
it
,
and
will
soon
get
over
his
love-lornity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
spoke
hopefully
,
but
could
not
rid
herself
of
the
foreboding
fear
*NL*
that
this
``
little
trial
''
would
be
harder
than
the
others
,
and
that
*NL*
Laurie
would
not
get
over
his
``
love-lornity
''
as
easily
as
heretofore
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plan
was
talked
over
in
a
family
council
,
and
agreed
upon
;
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Kirke
gladly
accepted
Jo
,
and
promised
to
make
a
pleasant
home
for
her
.
*NL*
The
teaching
would
render
her
independent
;
and
such
leisure
as
she
got
*NL*
might
be
made
profitable
by
writing
,
while
the
new
scenes
and
society
*NL*
would
be
both
useful
and
agreeable
.
Jo
liked
the
prospect
and
was
eager
*NL*
to
be
gone
,
for
the
home-nest
was
growing
too
narrow
for
her
restless
*NL*
nature
and
adventurous
spirit
.
When
all
was
settled
,
with
fear
and
*NL*
trembling
she
told
Laurie
;
but
to
her
surprise
he
took
it
very
quietly
.
*NL*
He
had
been
graver
than
usual
of
late
,
but
very
pleasant
;
and
,
when
*NL*
jokingly
accused
of
turning
over
a
new
leaf
,
he
answered
soberly
,
``
So
I
*NL*
am
;
and
I
mean
this
one
shall
stay
turned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
was
very
much
relieved
that
one
of
his
virtuous
fits
should
come
on
*NL*
just
then
,
and
made
her
preparations
with
a
lightened
heart
,
--
for
Beth
*NL*
seemed
more
cheerful
,
--
and
hoped
she
was
doing
the
best
for
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
I
leave
to
your
especial
care
,
''
she
said
,
the
night
before
*NL*
she
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
mean
your
papers
?
''
asked
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
boy
.
Be
very
good
to
him
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
will
;
but
I
ca
n't
fill
your
place
,
and
he
'll
miss
you
*NL*
sadly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wo
n't
hurt
him

so
remember

in

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
my
best

for
your

''
promised
Beth
,
wondering
why
Jo
looked
*NL*
at
her
so
queerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Laurie
said
``
Good-by
,
''
he
whispered
significantly
,
``
It
wo
n't
do
a
*NL*
bit
of
good

My

on

DEAR

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
write
you
a
regular
volume
,
for
I
've
got
heaps
to
*NL*
tell
,
though
I
'm
not
a
fine
young
lady
travelling
on
the
*NL*
continent
.
When
I
lost
sight
of
father
's
dear
old
face
,
I
felt
a
*NL*
trifle
blue
,
and
might
have
shed
a
briny
drop
or
two
,
if
an
*NL*
Irish
lady
with
four
small
children
,
all
crying
more
or
less
,
*NL*
had
n't
diverted
my
mind
;
for
I
amused
myself
by
dropping
*NL*
gingerbread
nuts
over
the
seat
every
time
they
opened
their
*NL*
mouths
to
roar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Soon
the
sun
came
out
,
and
taking
it
as
a
good
omen
,
I
cleared
*NL*
up
likewise
,
and
enjoyed
my
journey
with
all
my
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Kirke
welcomed
me
so
kindly
I
felt
at
home
at
once
,
even
*NL*
in
that
big
house
full
of
strangers
.
She
gave
me
a
funny
little
*NL*
sky-parlor
--
all
she
had
;
but
there
is
a
stove
in
it
,
and
a
nice
*NL*
table
in
a
sunny
window
,
so
I
can
sit
here
and
write
whenever
I
*NL*
like
.
A
fine
view
and
a
church-tower
opposite
atone
for
the
many
*NL*
stairs
,
and
I
took
a
fancy
to
my
den
on
the
spot
.
The
nursery
,
*NL*
where
I
am
to
teach
and
sew
,
is
a
pleasant
room
next
Mrs.
*NL*
Kirke

private
parlor

the
two
little
girls
are
pretty
*NL*
children

rather
spoilt

I
fancy

they
took
to
me
after

telling
them

I

no

I
shall

make
a

I
am

for
the

I
do

bashful

no

believe
it

`
Now
,
my
dear

make
yourself
at
home

said
Mrs.
K.
in
her
*NL*
motherly
way
;
`
I
'm
on
the
drive
from
morning
to
night
,
as
you
*NL*
may
suppose
with
such
a
family
;
but
a
great
anxiety
will
be
off
*NL*
my
mind
if
I
know
the
children
are
safe
with
you
.
My
rooms
are
*NL*
always
open
to
you
,
and
your
own
shall
be
as
comfortable
as
I
*NL*
can
make
it
.
There
are
some
pleasant
people
in
the
house
if
you
*NL*
feel
sociable
,
and
your
evenings
are
always
free
.
Come
to
me
if
*NL*
anything
goes
wrong
,
and
be
as
happy
as
you
can
.
There
's
the
*NL*
tea-bell
;
I
must
run
and
change
my
cap
;
'
and
off
she
bustled
,
*NL*
leaving
me
to
settle
myself
in
my
new
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
went
downstairs
,
soon
after
,
I
saw
something
I
liked
.
The
*NL*
flights
are
very
long
in
this
tall
house
,
and
as
I
stood
waiting
*NL*
at
the
head
of
the
third
one
for
a
little
servant
girl
to
lumber
*NL*
up
,
I
saw
a
gentleman
come
along
behind
her
,
take
the
heavy
hod
*NL*
of
coal
out
of
her
hand
,
carry
it
all
the
way
up
,
put
it
down
at
*NL*
a
door
near
by
,
and
walk
away
,
saying
,
with
a
kind
nod
and
a
*NL*
foreign
accent
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
It
goes
better
so
.
The
little
back
is
too
young
to
haf
such
*NL*
heaviness
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
it
good
of
him
?
I
like
such
things
,
for
,
as
father
says
,
*NL*
trifles
show
character
.
When
I
mentioned
it
to
Mrs.
K.
,
that
*NL*
evening
,
she
laughed
,
and
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
That
must
have
been
Professor
Bhaer
;
he
's
always
doing
things
*NL*
of
that
sort
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
K.
told
me
he
was
from
Berlin
;
very
learned
and
good
,
but
*NL*
poor
as
a
church-mouse
,
and
gives
lessons
to
support
himself
and
*NL*
two
little
orphan
nephews
whom
he
is
educating
here
,
according
*NL*
to
the
wishes
of
his
sister
,
who
married
an
American
.
Not
a
very
*NL*
romantic
story
,
but
it
interested
me
;
and
I
was
glad
to
hear
*NL*
that
Mrs.
K.
lends
him
her
parlor
for
some
of
his
scholars
.
*NL*
There
is
a
glass
door
between
it
and
the
nursery
,
and
I
mean
to
*NL*
peep
at
him
,
and
then
I
'll
tell
you
how
he
looks

He
's
almost
*NL*
forty
,
so
it
's
no
harm

After
tea
and
a
go-to-bed
romp
with
the
little
girls
,
I
*NL*
attacked
the
big
work-basket
,
and
had
a
quiet
evening
chatting
*NL*
with
my
new
friend
.
I
shall
keep
a
journal-letter
,
and
send
it
*NL*
once
a

good-night

``
Had
a
lively
time
in
my

this
morning

the
*NL*
children
acted
like
Sancho
;
and
at
one
time
I
really
thought
I
*NL*
should
shake
them
all
round
.
Some
good
angel
inspired
me
to
try
*NL*
gymnastics
,
and
I
kept
it
up
till
they
were
glad
to
sit
down
and
*NL*
keep
still
.
After
luncheon
,
the
girl
took
them
out
for
a
walk
,
*NL*
and
I
went
to
my
needlework
,
like
little
Mabel
,
`
with
a
willing
*NL*
mind
.
'
I
was
thanking
my
stars
that
I
'd
learned
to
make
nice
*NL*
button-holes
,
when
the
parlor-door
opened
and
shut
,
and
some
one
*NL*
began
to
hum
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
Kennst
du
das
land
,
'
*NL*
*NL*
like
a
big
bumble-bee
.
It
was
dreadfully
improper
,
I
know
,
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
resist
the
temptation
;
and
lifting
one
end
of
the
*NL*
curtain
before
the
glass
door
,
I
peeped
in
.
Professor
Bhaer
was
*NL*
there
;
and
while
he
arranged
his
books
,
I
took
a
good
look
at
*NL*
him
.
A
regular
German
,
--
rather
stout
,
with
brown
hair
tumbled
*NL*
all
over
his
head
,
a
bushy
beard
,
good
nose
,
the
kindest
eyes
I
*NL*
ever
saw
,
and
a
splendid
big
voice
that
does
one
's
ears
good
,
*NL*
after
our
sharp
or
slipshod
American
gabble
.
His
clothes
were
*NL*
rusty
,
his
hands
were
large
,
and
he
had
n't
a
really
handsome
*NL*
feature
in
his
face
,
except
his
beautiful
teeth
;
yet
I
liked
*NL*
him
,
for
he
had
a
fine
head
;
his
linen
was
very
nice
,
and
he
*NL*
looked
like
a
gentleman
,
though
two
buttons
were
off
his
coat
,
*NL*
and
there
was
a
patch
on
one
shoe
.
He
looked
sober
in
spite
of
*NL*
his
humming
,
till
he
went
to
the
window
to
turn
the
hyacinth
*NL*
bulbs
toward
the
sun
,
and
stroke
the
cat
,
who
received
him
like
*NL*
an
old
friend
.
Then
he
smiled
;
and
when
a
tap
came
at
the
door
,
*NL*
called
out
in
a
loud
,
brisk
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Herein
!
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
going
to
run
,
when
I
caught
sight
of
a
morsel
of
a
*NL*
child
carrying
a
big
book
,
and
stopped
to
see
what
was
going
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Me

said
the
mite
,
slamming
down
her
book

*NL*
running
to
meet
him
.

''

Tina

said
the
Professor
,
catching
her
up
,
with
a
*NL*
laugh
,
and
holding
her
so
high
over
his
head
that
she
had
to
*NL*
stoop
her
little
face
to
kiss
him

`
Now
me
mus
tuddy
my

went
on
the
funny
little
thing
;
*NL*
so
he
put
her
up
at
the
table
,
opened
the
great
dictionary
she
*NL*
had
brought
,
and
gave
her
a
paper
and
pencil
,
and
she
scribbled
*NL*
away
,
turning
a
leaf
now
and
then
,
and
passing
her
little
fat
*NL*
finger
down
the
page
,
as
if
finding
a
word
,
so
soberly
that
I
*NL*
nearly
betrayed
myself
by
a
laugh
,
while
Mr.
Bhaer
stood
*NL*
stroking
her
pretty
hair
,
with
a
fatherly
look
,
that
made
me
*NL*
think
she
must
be
his
own
,
though
she
looked
more
French
than
*NL*
German
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
knock
and
the
appearance
of
two
young
ladies
sent
me
*NL*
back
to
my
work
,
and
there
I
virtuously
remained
through
all
the
*NL*
noise
and
gabbling
that
went
on
next
door
.
One
of
the
girls
kept
*NL*
laughing
affectedly
,
and
saying
`
Now
Professor
,
'
in
a
*NL*
coquettish
tone
,
and
the
other
pronounced
her
German
with
an
*NL*
accent
that
must
have
made
it
hard
for
him
to
keep
sober
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
seemed
to
try
his
patience
sorely
;
for
more
than
once
I
*NL*
heard
him
say
emphatically
,
`
No

no

it
is
_
not
_
so
;
you
haf
not
*NL*
attend
to
what
I

and
once
there
was
a
loud
rap

as

Poor

I
pitied

and
when

gone

took
just
*NL*
one
more
peep
,
to
see
if
he
survived
it
.
He
seemed
to
have
*NL*
thrown
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
tired
out
,
and
sat
there
with
*NL*
his
eyes
shut
till
the
clock
struck
two
,
when
he
jumped
up

put
*NL*
his
books
in

pocket

as

ready
for
another
lesson

and
,
*NL*
taking
little
Tina
,
who
had
fallen
asleep
on
the
sofa
,
in
his
*NL*
arms
,
he
carried
her
quietly
away

he
has
a
hard
life

*NL*

Mrs.
Kirke
asked
me
if
I
would
n't
go
down
to
the
five
o'clock
*NL*
dinner
;
and
,
feeling
a
little
bit
homesick
,
I
thought
I
would
,
*NL*
just
to
see
what
sort
of
people
are
under
the
same
roof
with
me
.
*NL*
So
I
made
myself
respectable
,
and
tried
to
slip
in
behind
Mrs.
*NL*
Kirke
;
but
as
she
is
short
,
and
I
'm
tall
,
my
efforts
at
*NL*
concealment
were
rather
a
failure
.
She
gave
me
a
seat
by
her
,
*NL*
and
after
my
face
cooled
off
,
I
plucked
up
courage
,
and
looked
*NL*
about
me
.
The
long
table
was
full
,
and
every
one
intent
on
*NL*
getting
their
dinner
,
--
the
gentlemen
especially
,
who
seemed
to
*NL*
be
eating
on
time
,
for
they
_
bolted
_
in
every
sense
of
the
word
,
*NL*
vanishing
as
soon
as
they
were
done
.
There
was
the
usual
*NL*
assortment
of
young
men
absorbed
in
themselves
;
young
couples
*NL*
absorbed
in
each
other
;
married
ladies
in
their
babies
,
and
old
*NL*
gentlemen
in
politics
.
I
do
n't
think
I
shall
care
to
have
much
*NL*
to
do
with
any
of
them
,
except
one
sweet-faced
maiden
lady
,
who
*NL*
looks
as
if
she
had
something
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cast
away
at
the
very
bottom
of
the
table
was
the
Professor
,
*NL*
shouting
answers
to
the
questions
of
a
very
inquisitive
,
deaf
*NL*
old
gentleman
on
one
side
,
and
talking
philosophy
with
a
*NL*
Frenchman
on
the
other

If
Amy
had
been
here
,
she
'd
have
turned
*NL*
her
back
on
him
forever
,
because
,
sad
to
relate
,
he
had
a
great
*NL*
appetite
,
and
shovelled
in
his
dinner
in
a
manner
which
would
*NL*
have
horrified
`
her
ladyship
.
'
I
did
n't
mind
,
for
I
like

went
upstairs

Yesterday
was
a
quiet
day
,
spent
in
teaching
,
sewing
,
and
*NL*
writing
in
my
little
room
,
which
is
very
cosey
,
with
a
light
and
*NL*
fire
.
I
picked
up
a
few
bits
of
news
,
and
was
introduced
to
the
*NL*
Professor
.
It
seems
that
Tina
is
the
child
of
the
Frenchwoman
*NL*
who
does
the
fine
ironing
in
the
laundry
here
.
The
little
thing
*NL*
has
lost
her
heart
to
Mr.
Bhaer
,
and
follows
him
about
the
house
*NL*
like
a
dog
whenever
he
is
at
home
,
which
delights
him
,
as
he
is
*NL*
very
fond
of
children
,
though
a
`
bacheldore
.
'
Kitty
and
Minnie
*NL*
Kirke
likewise
regard
him
with
affection
,
and
tell
all
sorts
of
*NL*
stories
about
the
plays
he
invents
,
the
presents
he
brings
,
and
*NL*
the
splendid
tales
he
tells
.
The
young
men
quiz
him
,
it
seems
,
*NL*
call
him
Old
Fritz
,
Lager
Beer
,
Ursa
Major
,
and
make
all
manner
*NL*
of
jokes
on
his
name
.
But
he
enjoys
it
like
a
boy
,
Mrs.
K.
says
,
*NL*
and
takes
it
so
good-naturedly
that
they
all
like
him
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
his
foreign
ways
.

The

Minnie

the
room
.
After
a
grand
*NL*
rummage
three
of
the
missing
articles
were
found
,
--
one
over
the
*NL*
bird-cage
,
one
covered
with
ink
,
and
a
third
burnt
brown
,
having
*NL*
been
used
as
a
holder
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Such
a
man
!
'
laughed
good-natured
Mrs.
K.
,
as
she
put
the
*NL*
relics
in
the
rag-bag
.
'
I
suppose
the
others
are
torn
up
to
rig
*NL*
ships
,
bandage
cut
fingers
,
or
make
kite-tails
.
It
's
dreadful
,
*NL*
but
I
ca
n't
scold
him
:
he
's
so
absent-minded
and
good-natured
,
*NL*
he
lets
those
boys
ride
over
him
rough-shod
.
I
agreed
to
do
his
*NL*
washing
and
mending
,
but
he
forgets
to
give
out
his
things
and
I
*NL*
forget
to
look
them
over
,
so
he
comes
to
a
sad
pass
sometimes
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Let
me
mend
them
,
'
said
I.
'
I
do
n't
mind
it
,
and
he
need
n't
*NL*
know
.
I
'd
like
to
,
--
he
's
so
kind
to
me
about
bringing
my
letters
*NL*
and
lending
books
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
have
got
his
things
in
order
,
and
knit
heels
into
two
*NL*
pairs
of
the
socks
,
--
for
they
were
boggled
out
of
shape
with
his
*NL*
queer
darns
.
Nothing
was
said
,
and
I
hoped
he
would
n't
find
it
*NL*
out
,
but
one
day
last
week
he
caught
me
at
it
.
Hearing
the
*NL*
lessons
he
gives
to
others
has
interested
and
amused
me
so
much
*NL*
that
I
took
a
fancy
to
learn
;
for
Tina
runs
in
and
out
,
leaving
*NL*
the
door
open
,
and
I
can
hear
.
I
had
been
sitting
near
this
*NL*
door
,
finishing
off
the
last
sock
,
and
trying
to
understand
what
*NL*
he
said
to
a
new
scholar
,
who
is
as
stupid
as
I
am
.
The
girl
had
*NL*
gone
,
and
I
thought
he
had
also
,
it
was
so
still
,
and
I
was
*NL*
busily
gabbling
over
a
verb
,
and
rocking
to
and
fro
in
a
most
*NL*
absurd
way
,
when
a
little
crow
made
me
look
up
,
and
there
was
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
looking
and
laughing
quietly
,
while
he
made
signs
to
*NL*
Tina
not
to
betray
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
So
!
'
he
said
,
as
I
stopped
and
stared
like
a
goose
,
`
you
peep
*NL*
at
me
,
I
peep
at
you
,
and
that
is
not
bad
;
but
see
,
I
am
not
*NL*
pleasanting
when
I
say
,
haf
you
a
wish
for
German
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Yes
;
but
you
are
too
busy
.
I
am
too
stupid
to
learn
,
'
I
*NL*
blundered
out
,
as
red
as
a
peony
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Prut
!
we
will
make
the
time
,
and
we
fail
not
to
find
the
*NL*
sense
.
At
efening
I
shall
gif
a
little
lesson
with
much
*NL*
gladness
;
for
,
look
you
,
Mees
Marsch
,
I
haf
this
debt
to
pay
,
'
*NL*
and
he
pointed
to
my
work
.
``
Yes
,
''
they
say
to
one
another
,
these
*NL*
so
kind
ladies
,
``
he
is
a
stupid
old
fellow
;
he
will
see
not
what
*NL*
we
do
;
he
will
never
opserve
that
his
sock-heels
go
not
in
holes
*NL*
any
more
,
he
will
think
his
buttons
grow
out
new
when
they
fall
,
*NL*
and
believe
that
strings
make
theirselves
.
''
Ah
!
but
I
haf
an
*NL*
eye
,
and
I
see
much
.
I
haf
a
heart
,
and
I
feel
the
thanks
for
*NL*
this
.
Come
,
a
little
lesson
then
and
now
,
or
no
more
good
fairy
*NL*
works
for
me
and
mine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
I
could
n't
say
anything
after
that
,
and
as
it
really
*NL*
is
a
splendid
opportunity
,
I
made
the
bargain
,
and
we
began
.
I
*NL*
took
four
lessons
,
and
then
I
stuck
fast
in
a
grammatical
bog
.
*NL*
The
Professor
was
very
patient
with
me
,
but
it
must
have
been
*NL*
torment
to
him
,
and
now
and
then
he
'd
look
at
me
with
such
an
*NL*
expression
of
mild
despair
that
it
was
a
toss-up
with
me
whether
*NL*
to
laugh
or
cry
.
I
tried
both
ways
;
and
when
it
came
to
a
sniff
*NL*
of
utter
mortification
and
woe
,
he
just
threw
the
grammar
on
to
*NL*
the
floor
,
and
marched
out
of
the
room
.
I
felt
myself
disgraced
*NL*
and
deserted
forever
,
but
did
n't
blame
him
a
particle
,
and
was
*NL*
scrambling
my
papers
together
,
meaning
to
rush
upstairs
and
*NL*
shake
myself
hard
,
when
in
he
came
,
as
brisk
and
beaming
as
if
*NL*
I
'd
covered
myself
with
glory
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Now
we
shall
try
a
new
way
.
You
and
I
will
read
these
pleasant
*NL*
little
Maerchen
together
,
and
dig
no
more
in
that
dry
book
,
that
*NL*
goes
in
the
corner
for
making
us
trouble
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
spoke
so
kindly
,
and
opened
Hans
Andersen
's
fairy
tales
so
*NL*
invitingly
before
me
,
that
I
was
more
ashamed
than
ever
,
and
*NL*
went
at
my
lesson
in
a
neck-or-nothing
style
that
seemed
to
*NL*
amuse
him
immensely
.
I
forgot
my
bashfulness
,
and
pegged
away
*NL*
-LRB-
no
other
word
will
express
it
-RRB-
with
all
my
might
,
tumbling
over
*NL*
long
words
,
pronouncing
according
to
the
inspiration
of
the
*NL*
minute
,
and
doing
my
very
best
.
When
I
finished
reading
my
first
*NL*
page
,
and
stopped
for
breath
,
he
clapped
his
hands
and
cried
*NL*
out
,
in
his
hearty
way
,
`
Das
ist
gute
!
Now
we
go
well
!
My
turn
.
*NL*
I
do
him
in
German
;
gif
me
your
ear
.
'
And
away
he
went
,
rumbling
*NL*
out
the
words
with
his
strong
voice
,
and
a
relish
which
was
good
*NL*
to
see
as
well
as
hear
.
Fortunately
the
story
was
the
`
Constant
*NL*
Tin
Soldier
,
'
which
is
droll
,
you
know
,
so
I
could
laugh
,
--
and
I
*NL*
did
,
--
though
I
did
n't
understand
half
he
read
,
for
I
could
n't
*NL*
help
it
,
he
was
so
earnest
,
I
so
excited
,
and
the
whole
thing
so
*NL*
comical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
that
we
got
on
better
,
and
now
I
read
my
lessons
pretty
*NL*
well
;
for
this
way
of
studying
suits
me
,
and
I
can
see
that
the
*NL*
grammar
gets
tucked
into
the
tales
and
poetry
as
one
gives
pills
*NL*
in
jelly
.
I
like
it
very
much
,
and
he
does
n't
seem
tired
of
it
*NL*
yet
,
--
which
is
very
good
of
him
,
is
n't
it
?
I
mean
to
give
him
*NL*
something
on
Christmas
,
for
I
dare
not
offer
money
.
Tell
me
*NL*
something
nice
,
Marmee

``
I
'm
glad
Laurie
seems
so
happy
and
busy
,
that
he
has
given
up
*NL*
smoking
,
and
lets
his
hair
grow
.
You
see
Beth
manages
him
better
*NL*
than
I
did
.
I
'm
not
jealous
,
dear
;
do
your
best
,
only
do
n't
make
*NL*
a
saint
of
him
.
I
'm
afraid
I
could
n't
like
him
without
a
spice
*NL*
of
human
naughtiness
.
Read
him
bits
of
my
letters
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
time
to
write
much
,
and
that
will
do
just
as
well

so
comfortable

A

you

my

family

which
of

*NL*
includes
Mr.
L.
and
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
Teddy

I
ca
n't
*NL*
tell
you
how
much
I
enjoyed
your
Christmas
bundle
,
for
I
did
n't
*NL*
get
it
till
night
,
and
had
given
up
hoping
.
Your
letter
came
in
*NL*
the
morning
,
but
you
said
nothing
about
a
parcel
,
meaning
it
*NL*
for
a
surprise
;
so
I
was
disappointed
,
for
I
'd
had
a
`
kind
of
a
*NL*
feeling
'
that
you
would
n't
forget
me
.
I
felt
a
little
low
in
my
*NL*
mind
,
as
I
sat
up
in
my
room
,
after
tea
;
and
when
the
big
,
*NL*
muddy
,
battered-looking
bundle
was
brought
to
me
,
I
just
hugged
*NL*
it
,
and
pranced
.
It
was
so
_
homey
_
and
refreshing
,
that
I
sat
*NL*
down
on
the
floor
and
read
and
looked
and
ate
and
laughed
and
*NL*
cried
,
in
my
usual
absurd
way

The
things
were
just
what
I
*NL*
wanted
,
and
all
the
better
for
being
made
instead
of
bought
.
*NL*
Beth
's
new
`
ink-bib
'
was
capital
;
and
Hannah
's
box
of
hard
*NL*
gingerbread
will
be
a
treasure

I
'll
be
sure
and
wear
the
nice
*NL*
flannels
you
sent

carefully

with

Homer

Milton

you
may
imagine
how
I
felt
when
he
*NL*
brought
it
down

without
its
cover

showed

him

he
will
help
you

for
the
study
of
character
*NL*
in

paint
it

``
I
thanked
him
as
well
as
I
could
,
and
talk
now
about
`
my
*NL*
library

as
if
I
had
a
hundred
books

I
never
knew
how
much
*NL*
there
was
in
Shakespeare
before
;
but
then
I
never
had
a
Bhaer
to
*NL*
explain
it
to
me
.
Now
_
do
n't
_
laugh
at
his
horrid
name
;
it
is
n't
*NL*
pronounced
either
Bear

Beer

you
both
like

I

him

admire
both

feel
rich

my
new
`

Friedrich
Bhaer

'
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
having
much
money
,
or
knowing
what
he
'd
like
,
I
got
several
*NL*
little
things
,
and
put
them
about
the
room
,
where
he
would
find
*NL*
them
unexpectedly
.
They
were
useful
,
pretty
,
or
funny
,
--
a
new
*NL*
standish
on
his
table
,
a
little
vase
for
his
flower
,
--
he
always
*NL*
has
one
,
or
a
bit
of
green
in
a
glass
,
to
keep
him
fresh
,
he
*NL*
says
,
--
and
a
holder
for
his
blower
,
so
that
he
need
n't
burn
up
*NL*
what
Amy
calls
`
mouchoirs

'
I
made
it
like
those
Beth
*NL*
invented
,

a
big
butterfly
with
a
fat
body
,
and
black
and
yellow
*NL*
wings
,
worsted
feelers
,
and
bead
eyes

It
took
his
fancy
*NL*
immensely
,
and
he
put
it
on
his
mantel-piece
as
an
article
of
*NL*
_
vertu
_
;
so
it
was
rather
a
failure
after
all
.
Poor
as
he
is
,
he
*NL*
did
n't
forget
a
servant
or
a
child
in
the
house
;
and
not
a
soul
*NL*
here
,
from
the
French
laundry-woman
to
Miss
Norton

forgot
him

was
so
glad

They
got
up
a
masquerade

a
gay
time
New

Eve

I
*NL*
did

mean
to
go
down
,
having
no
dress

at
the
last
minute
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Kirke
remembered
some
old
brocades
,
and
Miss
Norton
lent
me
*NL*
lace
and
feathers
;
so
I
dressed
up
as
Mrs.
Malaprop
,
and
sailed
*NL*
in
with
a
mask
on
.
No
one
knew
me

for
I
disguised
my
voice
,
and
*NL*
no
one
dreamed
of
the
silent
,
haughty
Miss
March

they
think
*NL*
I
am
very
stiff
and
cool
,
most
of
them
;
and
so
I
am
to
*NL*
whipper-snappers
-RRB-
could
dance
and
dress
,
and
burst
out
into
a
*NL*
`
nice
derangement
of
epitaphs
,
like
an
allegory
on
the
banks
of
*NL*
the
Nile

I
enjoyed
it
very
much
;
and
when
we
unmasked
,
it
was
*NL*
fun
to
see
them
stare
at
me

I
heard
one
of
the
young
men
tell
*NL*
another
that
he
knew
I
'd
been
an
actress

in
fact

seeing
me
at
one
of
the
minor
theatres

Meg
will

Mr.
Bhaer
was
Nick
Bottom
,
and
Tina
was
*NL*
Titania

a
perfect
little
fairy
in
his
arms

To
see
them
dance

was
`
quite
a

to
use
a
Teddy-ism

In

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
XXXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
FRIEND
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
very
happy
in
the
social
atmosphere
about
her
,
and
very
busy
with
*NL*
the
daily
work
that
earned
her
bread
,
and
made
it
sweeter
for
the
*NL*
effort
,
Jo
still
found
time
for
literary
labors
.
The
purpose
which
now
*NL*
took
possession
of
her
was
a
natural
one
to
a
poor
and
ambitious
girl
;
*NL*
but
the
means
she
took
to
gain
her
end
were
not
the
best
.
She
saw
that
*NL*
money
conferred
power
:
money
and
power
,
therefore
,
she
resolved
to
have
;
*NL*
not
to
be
used
for
herself
alone
,
but
for
those
whom
she
loved
more
than
*NL*
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dream
of
filling
home
with
comforts
,
giving
Beth
everything
she
*NL*
wanted
,
from
strawberries
in
winter
to
an
organ
in
her
bedroom
;
going
*NL*
abroad
herself
,
and
always
having
_
more
_
than
enough
,
so
that
she
might
*NL*
indulge
in
the
luxury
of
charity
,
had
been
for
years
Jo
's
most
cherished
*NL*
castle
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
prize-story
experience
had
seemed
to
open
a
way
which
might
,
after
*NL*
long
travelling
and
much
up-hill
work
lead
to
this
delightful
_
chateau
*NL*
en
Espagne
_
.
But
the
novel
disaster
quenched
her
courage
for
a
time
,
for
*NL*
public
opinion
is
a
giant
which
has
frightened
stouter-hearted
Jacks
on
*NL*
bigger
bean-stalks
than
hers
.
Like
that
immortal
hero
,
she
reposed
*NL*
awhile
after
the
first
attempt
,
which
resulted
in
a
tumble
,
and
the
*NL*
least
lovely
of
the
giant
's
treasures
,
if
I
remember
rightly
.
But
the
*NL*
``
up
again
and
take
another
''
spirit
was
as
strong
in
Jo
as
in
Jack
;
so
*NL*
she
scrambled
up
,
on
the
shady
side
this
time
,
and
got
more
booty
,
but
*NL*
nearly
left
behind
her
what
was
far
more
precious
than
the
money-bags
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
to
writing
sensation
stories
;
for
in
those
dark
ages
,
even
*NL*
all-perfect
America
read
rubbish
.
She
told
no
one
,
but
concocted
a
*NL*
``
thrilling
tale
,
''
and
boldly
carried
it
herself
to
Mr.
Dashwood
,
editor
*NL*
of
the
``
Weekly
Volcano
.
''
She
had
never
read
``
Sartor
Resartus
,
''
but
she
*NL*
had
a
womanly
instinct
that
clothes
possess
an
influence
more
powerful
*NL*
over
many
than
the
worth
of
character
or
the
magic
of
manners
.
So
she
*NL*
dressed
herself
in
her
best
,
and
,
trying
to
persuade
herself
that
she
*NL*
was
neither
excited
nor
nervous
,
bravely
climbed
two
pairs
of
dark
and
*NL*
dirty
stairs
to
find
herself
in
a
disorderly
room
,
a
cloud
of
*NL*
cigar-smoke
,
and
the
presence
of
three
gentlemen
,
sitting
with
their
*NL*
heels
rather
higher
than
their
hats
,
which
articles
of
dress
none
of
*NL*
them
took
the
trouble
to
remove
on
her
appearance
.
Somewhat
daunted
by
*NL*
this
reception
,
Jo
hesitated
on
the
threshold
,
murmuring
in
much
*NL*
embarrassment
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
I
was
looking
for
the
`
Weekly
Volcano
'
office
;
I
wished
to
*NL*
see
Mr.
Dashwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Down
went
the
highest
pair
of
heels
,
up
rose
the
smokiest
gentleman
,
*NL*
and
,
carefully
cherishing
his
cigar
between
his
fingers
,
he
advanced
,
*NL*
with
a
nod
,
and
a
countenance
expressive
of
nothing
but
sleep
.
Feeling
*NL*
that
she
must
get
through
the
matter
somehow
,
Jo
produced
her
*NL*
manuscript
,
and
,
blushing
redder
and
redder
with
each
sentence
,
*NL*
blundered
out
fragments
of
the
little
speech
carefully
prepared
for
the
*NL*
occasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
friend
of
mine
desired
me
to
offer
--
a
story
--
just
as
an
*NL*
experiment
--
would
like
your
opinion
--
be
glad
to
write
more
if
this
*NL*
suits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
blushed
and
blundered
,
Mr.
Dashwood
had
taken
the
manuscript
,
*NL*
and
was
turning
over
the
leaves
with
a
pair
of
rather
dirty
fingers
,
and
*NL*
casting
critical
glances
up
and
down
the
neat
pages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
first
attempt
,
I
take
it
?
''
observing
that
the
pages
were
*NL*
numbered
,
covered
only
on
one
side
,
and
not
tied
up
with
a
ribbon
,
--
sure
*NL*
sign
of
a
novice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
;
she
has
had
some
experience
,
and
got
a
prize
for
a
tale
in
the
*NL*
`
Blarneystone
Banner
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
did
she
?
''
and
Mr.
Dashwood
gave
Jo
a
quick
look
,
which
seemed
to
*NL*
take
note
of
everything
she
had
on
,
from
the
bow
in
her
bonnet
to
the
*NL*
buttons
on
her
boots
.
``
Well
,
you
can
leave
it
,
if
you
like
.
We
've
more
*NL*
of
this
sort
of
thing
on
hand
than
we
know
what
to
do
with
at
present
;
*NL*
but
I
'll
run
my
eye
over
it
,
and
give
you
an
answer
next
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Jo
did
_
not
_
like
to
leave
it
,
for
Mr.
Dashwood
did
n't
suit
her
at
*NL*
all
;
but
,
under
the
circumstances
,
there
was
nothing
for
her
to
do
but
*NL*
bow
and
walk
away
,
looking
particularly
tall
and
dignified
,
as
she
was
*NL*
apt
to
do
when
nettled
or
abashed
.
Just
then
she
was
both
;
for
it
was
*NL*
perfectly
evident
,
from
the
knowing
glances
exchanged
among
the
*NL*
gentlemen
,
that
her
little
fiction
of
``
my
friend
''
was
considered
a
good
*NL*
joke
;
and
a
laugh
,
produced
by
some
inaudible
remark
of
the
editor
,
as
*NL*
he
closed
the
door
,
completed
her
discomfiture
.
Half
resolving
never
to
*NL*
return
,
she
went
home
,
and
worked
off
her
irritation
by
stitching
*NL*
pinafores
vigorously
;
and
in
an
hour
or
two
was
cool
enough
to
laugh
*NL*
over
the
scene
,
and
long
for
next
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
went
again
,
Mr.
Dashwood
was
alone
,
whereat
she
rejoiced
;
Mr.
*NL*
Dashwood
was
much
wider
awake
than
before
,
which
was
agreeable
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Dashwood
was
not
too
deeply
absorbed
in
a
cigar
to
remember
his
manners
:
*NL*
so
the
second
interview
was
much
more
comfortable
than
the
first
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
take
this
''
-LRB-
editors
never
say
I
-RRB-
,
``
if
you
do
n't
object
to
a
few
*NL*
alterations
.
It
's
too
long
,
but
omitting
the
passages
I
've
marked
will
*NL*
make
it
just
the
right
length
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
business-like
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
hardly
knew
her
own
MS.
again
,
so
crumpled
and
underscored
were
its
*NL*
pages
and
paragraphs
;
but
,
feeling
as
a
tender
parent
might
on
being
*NL*
asked
to
cut
off
her
baby
's
legs
in
order
that
it
might
fit
into
a
new
*NL*
cradle
,
she
looked
at
the
marked
passages
,
and
was
surprised
to
find
*NL*
that
all
the
moral
reflections
--
which
she
had
carefully
put
in
as
*NL*
ballast
for
much
romance
--
had
been
stricken
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
sir
,
I
thought
every
story
should
have
some
sort
of
a
moral
,
so
I
*NL*
took
care
to
have
a
few
of
my
sinners
repent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dashwood
's
editorial
gravity
relaxed
into
a
smile
,
for
Jo
had
*NL*
forgotten
her
``
friend
,
''
and
spoken
as
only
an
author
could
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
want
to
be
amused
,
not
preached
at
,
you
know
.
Morals
do
n't
sell
*NL*
nowadays
;
''
which
was
not
quite
a
correct
statement
,
by
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
it
would
do
with
these
alterations
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
's
a
new
plot
,
and
pretty
well
worked
up
--
language
good
,
and
so
*NL*
on
,
''
was
Mr.
Dashwood
's
affable
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
--
that
is
,
what
compensation
--
''
began
Jo
,
not
exactly
*NL*
knowing
how
to
express
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
well
,
we
give
from
twenty-five
to
thirty
for
things
of
this
*NL*
sort
.
Pay
when
it
comes
out
,
''
returned
Mr.
Dashwood
,
as
if
that
point
*NL*
had
escaped
him
;
such
trifles
often
do
escape
the
editorial
mind
,
it
is
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
you
can
have
it
,
''
said
Jo
,
handing
back
the
story
,
with
a
*NL*
satisfied
air
;
for
,
after
the
dollar-a-column
work
,
even
twenty-five
*NL*
seemed
good
pay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
my
friend
you
will
take
another
if
she
has
one
better
than
*NL*
this
?
''
asked
Jo
,
unconscious
of
her
little
slip
of
the
tongue
,
and
*NL*
emboldened
by
her
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
'll
look
at
it
;
ca
n't
promise
to
take
it
.
Tell
her
to
make
it
*NL*
short
and
spicy
,
and
never
mind
the
moral
.
What
name
would
your
friend
*NL*
like
to
put
to
it
?
''
in
a
careless
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all
,
if
you
please
;
she
does
n't
wish
her
name
to
appear
,
and
*NL*
has
no
_
nom
de
plume
_
,
''
said
Jo
,
blushing
in
spite
of
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
she
likes
,
of
course
.
The
tale
will
be
out
next
week
;
will
you
*NL*
call
for
the
money
,
or
shall
I
send
it
?
''
asked
Mr.
Dashwood
,
who
felt
a
*NL*
natural
desire
to
know
who
his
new
contributor
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
call
.
Good
morning
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
departed
,
Mr.
Dashwood
put
up
his
feet
,
with
the
graceful
remark
,
*NL*
``
Poor
and
proud
,
as
usual
,
but
she
'll
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Following
Mr.
Dashwood
's
directions
,
and
making
Mrs.
Northbury
her
*NL*
model
,
Jo
rashly
took
a
plunge
into
the
frothy
sea
of
sensational
*NL*
literature
;
but
,
thanks
to
the
life-preserver
thrown
her
by
a
friend
,
*NL*
she
came
up
again
,
not
much
the
worse
for
her
ducking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
most
young
scribblers
,
she
went
abroad
for
her
characters
and
*NL*
scenery
;
and
banditti
,
counts
,
gypsies
,
nuns
,
and
duchesses
appeared
*NL*
upon
her
stage
,
and
played
their
parts
with
as
much
accuracy
and
spirit
*NL*
as
could
be
expected
.
Her
readers
were
not
particular
about
such
trifles
*NL*
as
grammar
,
punctuation
,
and
probability
,
and
Mr.
Dashwood
graciously
*NL*
permitted
her
to
fill
his
columns
at
the
lowest
prices
,
not
thinking
it
*NL*
necessary
to
tell
her
that
the
real
cause
of
his
hospitality
was
the
*NL*
fact
that
one
of
his
hacks
,
on
being
offered
higher
wages
,
had
basely
*NL*
left
him
in
the
lurch
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
soon
became
interested
in
her
work
,
for
her
emaciated
purse
grew
*NL*
stout
,
and
the
little
hoard
she
was
making
to
take
Beth
to
the
mountains
*NL*
next
summer
grew
slowly
but
surely
as
the
weeks
passed
.
One
thing
*NL*
disturbed
her
satisfaction
,
and
that
was
that
she
did
not
tell
them
at
*NL*
home
.
She
had
a
feeling
that
father
and
mother
would
not
approve
,
and
*NL*
preferred
to
have
her
own
way
first
,
and
beg
pardon
afterward
.
It
was
*NL*
easy
to
keep
her
secret
,
for
no
name
appeared
with
her
stories
;
Mr.
*NL*
Dashwood
had
,
of
course
,
found
it
out
very
soon
,
but
promised
to
be
*NL*
dumb
;
and
,
for
a
wonder
,
kept
his
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
it
would
do
her
no
harm
,
for
she
sincerely
meant
to
write
*NL*
nothing
of
which
she
should
be
ashamed
,
and
quieted
all
pricks
of
*NL*
conscience
by
anticipations
of
the
happy
minute
when
she
should
show
her
*NL*
earnings
and
laugh
over
her
well-kept
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mr.
Dashwood
rejected
any
but
thrilling
tales
;
and
,
as
thrills
could
*NL*
not
be
produced
except
by
harrowing
up
the
souls
of
the
readers
,
history
*NL*
and
romance
,
land
and
sea
,
science
and
art
,
police
records
and
lunatic
*NL*
asylums
,
had
to
be
ransacked
for
the
purpose
.
Jo
soon
found
that
her
*NL*
innocent
experience
had
given
her
but
few
glimpses
of
the
tragic
world
*NL*
which
underlies
society
;
so
,
regarding
it
in
a
business
light
,
she
set
*NL*
about
supplying
her
deficiencies
with
characteristic
energy
.
Eager
to
*NL*
find
material
for
stories
,
and
bent
on
making
them
original
in
plot
,
if
*NL*
not
masterly
in
execution
,
she
searched
newspapers
for
accidents
,
*NL*
incidents
,
and
crimes
;
she
excited
the
suspicions
of
public
librarians
*NL*
by
asking
for
works
on
poisons
;
she
studied
faces
in
the
street
,
and
*NL*
characters
,
good
,
bad
,
and
indifferent
,
all
about
her
;
she
delved
in
the
*NL*
dust
of
ancient
times
for
facts
or
fictions
so
old
that
they
were
as
*NL*
good
as
new
,
and
introduced
herself
to
folly
,
sin
,
and
misery
,
as
well
*NL*
as
her
limited
opportunities
allowed
.
She
thought
she
was
prospering
*NL*
finely
;
but
,
unconsciously
,
she
was
beginning
to
desecrate
some
of
the
*NL*
womanliest
attributes
of
a
woman
's
character
.
She
was
living
in
bad
*NL*
society
;
and
,
imaginary
though
it
was
,
its
influence
affected
her
,
for
*NL*
she
was
feeding
heart
and
fancy
on
dangerous
and
unsubstantial
food
,
and
*NL*
was
fast
brushing
the
innocent
bloom
from
her
nature
by
a
premature
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
darker
side
of
life
,
which
comes
soon
enough
to
*NL*
all
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
beginning
to
feel
rather
than
see
this
,
for
much
describing
of
*NL*
other
people
's
passions
and
feelings
set
her
to
studying
and
speculating
*NL*
about
her
own
,
--
a
morbid
amusement
,
in
which
healthy
young
minds
do
not
*NL*
voluntarily
indulge
.
Wrong-doing
always
brings
its
own
punishment
;
and
,
*NL*
when
Jo
most
needed
hers
,
she
got
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
whether
the
study
of
Shakespeare
helped
her
to
read
*NL*
character
,
or
the
natural
instinct
of
a
woman
for
what
was
honest
,
*NL*
brave
,
and
strong
;
but
while
endowing
her
imaginary
heroes
with
every
*NL*
perfection
under
the
sun
,
Jo
was
discovering
a
live
hero
,
who
interested
*NL*
her
in
spite
of
many
human
imperfections
.
Mr.
Bhaer
,
in
one
of
their
*NL*
conversations
,
had
advised
her
to
study
simple
,
true
,
and
lovely
*NL*
characters
,
wherever
she
found
them
,
as
good
training
for
a
writer
.
Jo
*NL*
took
him
at
his
word
,
for
she
coolly
turned
round
and
studied
him
,
--
a
*NL*
proceeding
which
would
have
much
surprised
him
,
had
he
known
it
,
for
the
*NL*
worthy
Professor
was
very
humble
in
his
own
conceit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
everybody
liked
him
was
what
puzzled
Jo
,
at
first
.
He
was
neither
*NL*
rich
nor
great
,
young
nor
handsome
;
in
no
respect
what
is
called
*NL*
fascinating
,
imposing
,
or
brilliant
;
and
yet
he
was
as
attractive
as
a
*NL*
genial
fire
,
and
people
seemed
to
gather
about
him
as
naturally
as
about
*NL*
a
warm
hearth
.
He
was
poor
,
yet
always
appeared
to
be
giving
something
*NL*
away
;
a
stranger
,
yet
every
one
was
his
friend
;
no
longer
young
,
but
as
*NL*
happy-hearted
as
a
boy
;
plain
and
peculiar
,
yet
his
face
looked
*NL*
beautiful
to
many
,
and
his
oddities
were
freely
forgiven
for
his
sake
.
*NL*
Jo
often
watched
him
,
trying
to
discover
the
charm
,
and
,
at
last
,
*NL*
decided
that
it
was
benevolence
which
worked
the
miracle
.
If
he
had
any
*NL*
sorrow
,
``
it
sat
with
its
head
under
its
wing
,
''
and
he
turned
only
his
*NL*
sunny
side
to
the
world
.
There
were
lines
upon
his
forehead
,
but
Time
*NL*
seemed
to
have
touched
him
gently
,
remembering
how
kind
he
was
to
*NL*
others
.
The
pleasant
curves
about
his
mouth
were
the
memorials
of
many
*NL*
friendly
words
and
cheery
laughs
;
his
eyes
were
never
cold
or
hard
,
and
*NL*
his
big
hand
had
a
warm
,
strong
grasp
that
was
more
expressive
than
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
very
clothes
seemed
to
partake
of
the
hospitable
nature
of
the
*NL*
wearer
.
They
looked
as
if
they
were
at
ease
,
and
liked
to
make
him
*NL*
comfortable
;
his
capacious
waistcoat
was
suggestive
of
a
large
heart
*NL*
underneath
;
his
rusty
coat
had
a
social
air
,
and
the
baggy
pockets
*NL*
plainly
proved
that
little
hands
often
went
in
empty
and
came
out
full
;
*NL*
his
very
boots
were
benevolent
,
and
his
collars
never
stiff
and
raspy
*NL*
like
other
people
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
it
!
''
said
Jo
to
herself
,
when
she
at
length
discovered
that
*NL*
genuine
good-will
towards
one
's
fellow-men
could
beautify
and
dignify
*NL*
even
a
stout
German
teacher
,
who
shovelled
in
his
dinner
,
darned
his
own
*NL*
socks
,
and
was
burdened
with
the
name
of
Bhaer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
valued
goodness
highly
,
but
she
also
possessed
a
most
feminine
*NL*
respect
for
intellect
,
and
a
little
discovery
which
she
made
about
the
*NL*
Professor
added
much
to
her
regard
for
him
.
He
never
spoke
of
himself
,
*NL*
and
no
one
ever
knew
that
in
his
native
city
he
had
been
a
man
much
*NL*
honored
and
esteemed
for
learning
and
integrity
,
till
a
countryman
came
*NL*
to
see
him
,
and
,
in
a
conversation
with
Miss
Norton
,
divulged
the
*NL*
pleasing
fact
.
From
her
Jo
learned
it
,
and
liked
it
all
the
better
*NL*
because
Mr.
Bhaer
had
never
told
it
.
She
felt
proud
to
know
that
he
was
*NL*
an
honored
Professor
in
Berlin
,
though
only
a
poor
language-master
in
*NL*
America
;
and
his
homely
,
hard-working
life
was
much
beautified
by
the
*NL*
spice
of
romance
which
this
discovery
gave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
and
a
better
gift
than
intellect
was
shown
her
in
a
most
*NL*
unexpected
manner
.
Miss
Norton
had
the
_
entree
_
into
literary
society
,
*NL*
which
Jo
would
have
had
no
chance
of
seeing
but
for
her
.
The
solitary
*NL*
woman
felt
an
interest
in
the
ambitious
girl
,
and
kindly
conferred
many
*NL*
favors
of
this
sort
both
on
Jo
and
the
Professor
.
She
took
them
with
*NL*
her
,
one
night
,
to
a
select
symposium
,
held
in
honor
of
several
*NL*
celebrities
.
*NL*

A
select
symposium
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
went
prepared
to
bow
down
and
adore
the
mighty
ones
whom
she
had
*NL*
worshipped
with
youthful
enthusiasm
afar
off
.
But
her
reverence
for
*NL*
genius
received
a
severe
shock
that
night
,
and
it
took
her
some
time
to
*NL*
recover
from
the
discovery
that
the
great
creatures
were
only
men
and
*NL*
women
after
all
.
Imagine
her
dismay
,
on
stealing
a
glance
of
timid
*NL*
admiration
at
the
poet
whose
lines
suggested
an
ethereal
being
fed
on
*NL*
``
spirit
,
fire
,
and
dew
,
''
to
behold
him
devouring
his
supper
with
an
*NL*
ardor
which
flushed
his
intellectual
countenance
.
Turning
as
from
a
*NL*
fallen
idol
,
she
made
other
discoveries
which
rapidly
dispelled
her
*NL*
romantic
illusions
.
The
great
novelist
vibrated
between
two
decanters
*NL*
with
the
regularity
of
a
pendulum
;
the
famous
divine
flirted
openly
with
*NL*
one
of
the
Madame
de
Staels
of
the
age
,
who
looked
daggers
at
another
*NL*
Corinne
,
who
was
amiably
satirizing
her
,
after
out-manoeuvring
her
in
*NL*
efforts
to
absorb
the
profound
philosopher
,
who
imbibed
tea
Johnsonianly
*NL*
and
appeared
to
slumber
,
the
loquacity
of
the
lady
rendering
speech
*NL*
impossible
.
The
scientific
celebrities
,
forgetting
their
mollusks
and
*NL*
glacial
periods
,
gossiped
about
art
,
while
devoting
themselves
to
*NL*
oysters
and
ices
with
characteristic
energy
;
the
young
musician
,
who
was
*NL*
charming
the
city
like
a
second
Orpheus
,
talked
horses
;
and
the
specimen
*NL*
of
the
British
nobility
present
happened
to
be
the
most
ordinary
man
of
*NL*
the
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
evening
was
half
over
,
Jo
felt
so
completely
_
desillusionee
_
,
*NL*
that
she
sat
down
in
a
corner
to
recover
herself
.
Mr.
Bhaer
soon
joined
*NL*
her
,
looking
rather
out
of
his
element
,
and
presently
several
of
the
*NL*
philosophers
,
each
mounted
on
his
hobby
,
came
ambling
up
to
hold
an
*NL*
intellectual
tournament
in
the
recess
.
The
conversation
was
miles
beyond
*NL*
Jo
's
comprehension
,
but
she
enjoyed
it
,
though
Kant
and
Hegel
were
*NL*
unknown
gods
,
the
Subjective
and
Objective
unintelligible
terms
;
and
the
*NL*
only
thing
``
evolved
from
her
inner
consciousness
,
''
was
a
bad
headache
*NL*
after
it
was
all
over
.
It
dawned
upon
her
gradually
that
the
world
was
*NL*
being
picked
to
pieces
,
and
put
together
on
new
,
and
,
according
to
the
*NL*
talkers
,
on
infinitely
better
principles
than
before
;
that
religion
was
*NL*
in
a
fair
way
to
be
reasoned
into
nothingness
,
and
intellect
was
to
be
*NL*
the
only
God
.
Jo
knew
nothing
about
philosophy
or
metaphysics
of
any
*NL*
sort
,
but
a
curious
excitement
,
half
pleasurable
,
half
painful
,
came
*NL*
over
her
,
as
she
listened
with
a
sense
of
being
turned
adrift
into
time
*NL*
and
space
,
like
a
young
balloon
out
on
a
holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
round
to
see
how
the
Professor
liked
it
,
and
found
him
*NL*
looking
at
her
with
the
grimmest
expression
she
had
ever
seen
him
wear
.
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
,
and
beckoned
her
to
come
away
;
but
she
was
*NL*
fascinated
,
just
then
,
by
the
freedom
of
Speculative
Philosophy
,
and
*NL*
kept
her
seat
,
trying
to
find
out
what
the
wise
gentlemen
intended
to
*NL*
rely
upon
after
they
had
annihilated
all
the
old
beliefs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Mr.
Bhaer
was
a
diffident
man
,
and
slow
to
offer
his
own
opinions
,
*NL*
not
because
they
were
unsettled
,
but
too
sincere
and
earnest
to
be
*NL*
lightly
spoken
.
As
he
glanced
from
Jo
to
several
other
young
people
,
*NL*
attracted
by
the
brilliancy
of
the
philosophic
pyrotechnics
,
he
knit
his
*NL*
brows
,
and
longed
to
speak
,
fearing
that
some
inflammable
young
soul
*NL*
would
be
led
astray
by
the
rockets
,
to
find
,
when
the
display
was
over
,
*NL*
that
they
had
only
an
empty
stick
or
a
scorched
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
bore
it
as
long
as
he
could
;
but
when
he
was
appealed
to
for
an
*NL*
opinion
,
he
blazed
up
with
honest
indignation
,
and
defended
religion
*NL*
with
all
the
eloquence
of
truth
,
--
an
eloquence
which
made
his
broken
*NL*
English
musical
,
and
his
plain
face
beautiful
.
He
had
a
hard
fight
,
for
*NL*
the
wise
men
argued
well
;
but
he
did
n't
know
when
he
was
beaten
,
and
*NL*
stood
to
his
colors
like
a
man
.
Somehow
,
as
he
talked
,
the
world
got
*NL*
right
again
to
Jo
;
the
old
beliefs
,
that
had
lasted
so
long
,
seemed
*NL*
better
than
the
new
;
God
was
not
a
blind
force
,
and
immortality
was
not
*NL*
a
pretty
fable
,
but
a
blessed
fact
.
She
felt
as
if
she
had
solid
ground
*NL*
under
her
feet
again
;
and
when
Mr.
Bhaer
paused
,
out-talked
,
but
not
one
*NL*
whit
convinced
,
Jo
wanted
to
clap
her
hands
and
thank
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
neither
;
but
she
remembered
this
scene
,
and
gave
the
Professor
*NL*
her
heartiest
respect
,
for
she
knew
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
speak
out
*NL*
then
and
there
,
because
his
conscience
would
not
let
him
be
silent
.
She
*NL*
began
to
see
that
character
is
a
better
possession
than
money
,
rank
,
*NL*
intellect
,
or
beauty
;
and
to
feel
that
if
greatness
is
what
a
wise
man
*NL*
has
defined
it
to
be
,
``
truth
,
reverence
,
and
good-will
,
''
then
her
friend
*NL*
Friedrich
Bhaer
was
not
only
good
,
but
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
belief
strengthened
daily
.
She
valued
his
esteem
,
she
coveted
his
*NL*
respect
,
she
wanted
to
be
worthy
of
his
friendship
;
and
,
just
when
the
*NL*
wish
was
sincerest
,
she
came
near
losing
everything
.
It
all
grew
out
of
*NL*
a
cocked
hat
;
for
one
evening
the
Professor
came
in
to
give
Jo
her
*NL*
lesson
,
with
a
paper
soldier-cap
on
his
head
,
which
Tina
had
put
there
,
*NL*
and
he
had
forgotten
to
take
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
evident
he
does
n't
look
in
his
glass
before
coming
down
,
''
thought
*NL*
Jo
,
with
a
smile
,
as
he
said
``
Goot
efening
,
''
and
sat
soberly
down
,
quite
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
ludicrous
contrast
between
his
subject
and
his
*NL*
head-gear
,
for
he
was
going
to
read
her
the
``
Death
of
Wallenstein
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

*NL*
*NL*
She
said
nothing
at
first
,
for
she
liked
to
hear
him
laugh
out
his
big
,
*NL*
hearty
laugh
,
when
anything
funny
happened
,
so
she
left
him
to
discover
*NL*
it
for
himself
,
and
presently
forgot
all
about
it
;
for
to
hear
a
German
*NL*
read
Schiller
is
rather
an
absorbing
occupation
.
After
the
reading
came
*NL*
the
lesson
,
which
was
a
lively
one
,
for
Jo
was
in
a
gay
mood
that
night
,
*NL*
and
the
cocked-hat
kept
her
eyes
dancing
with
merriment
.
The
Professor
*NL*
did
n't
know
what
to
make
of
her
,
and
stopped
at
last
,
to
ask
,
with
an
*NL*
air
of
mild
surprise
that
was
irresistible
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mees
Marsch
,
for
what
do
you
laugh
in
your
master
's
face
?
Haf
you
no
*NL*
respect
for
me
,
that
you
go
on
so
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
be
respectful
,
sir
,
when
you
forget
to
take
your
hat
off
?
''
*NL*
said
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lifting
his
hand
to
his
head
,
the
absent-minded
Professor
gravely
felt
*NL*
and
removed
the
little
cocked-hat
,
looked
at
it
a
minute
,
and
then
threw
*NL*
back
his
head
,
and
laughed
like
a
merry
bass-viol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
see
him
now
;
it
is
that
imp
Tina
who
makes
me
a
fool
with
my
cap
.
*NL*
Well
,
it
is
nothing
;
but
see
you
,
if
this
lesson
goes
not
well
,
you
too
*NL*
shall
wear
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
lesson
did
not
go
at
all
for
a
few
minutes
,
because
Mr.
Bhaer
*NL*
caught
sight
of
a
picture
on
the
hat
,
and
,
unfolding
it
,
said
,
with
an
*NL*
air
of
great
disgust
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
these
papers
did
not
come
in
the
house
;
they
are
not
for
*NL*
children
to
see
,
nor
young
people
to
read
.
It
is
not
well
,
and
I
haf
no
*NL*
patience
with
those
who
make
this
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
glanced
at
the
sheet
,
and
saw
a
pleasing
illustration
composed
of
a
*NL*
lunatic
,
a
corpse
,
a
villain
,
and
a
viper
.
She
did
not
like
it
;
but
the
*NL*
impulse
that
made
her
turn
it
over
was
not
one
of
displeasure
,
but
fear
,
*NL*
because
,
for
a
minute
,
she
fancied
the
paper
was
the
``
Volcano
.
''
It
was
*NL*
not
,
however
,
and
her
panic
subsided
as
she
remembered
that
,
even
if
it
*NL*
had
been
,
and
one
of
her
own
tales
in
it
,
there
would
have
been
no
name
*NL*
to
betray
her
.
She
had
betrayed
herself
,
however
,
by
a
look
and
a
blush
;
*NL*
for
,
though
an
absent
man
,
the
Professor
saw
a
good
deal
more
than
*NL*
people
fancied
.
He
knew
that
Jo
wrote
,
and
had
met
her
down
among
the
*NL*
newspaper
offices
more
than
once
;
but
as
she
never
spoke
of
it
,
he
asked
*NL*
no
questions
,
in
spite
of
a
strong
desire
to
see
her
work
.
Now
it
*NL*
occurred
to
him
that
she
was
doing
what
she
was
ashamed
to
own
,
and
it
*NL*
troubled
him
.
He
did
not
say
to
himself
,
``
It
is
none
of
my
business
;
*NL*
I
've
no
right
to
say
anything
,
''
as
many
people
would
have
done
;
he
only
*NL*
remembered
that
she
was
young
and
poor
,
a
girl
far
away
from
mother
's
*NL*
love
and
father
's
care
;
and
he
was
moved
to
help
her
with
an
impulse
as
*NL*
quick
and
natural
as
that
which
would
prompt
him
to
put
out
his
hand
to
*NL*
save
a
baby
from
a
puddle
.
All
this
flashed
through
his
mind
in
a
*NL*
minute
,
but
not
a
trace
of
it
appeared
in
his
face
;
and
by
the
time
the
*NL*
paper
was
turned
,
and
Jo
's
needle
threaded
,
he
was
ready
to
say
quite
*NL*
naturally
,
but
very
gravely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
right
to
put
it
from
you
.
I
do
not
like
to
think
that
good
*NL*
young
girls
should
see
such
things
.
They
are
made
pleasant
to
some
,
but
*NL*
I
would
more
rather
give
my
boys
gunpowder
to
play
with
than
this
bad
*NL*
trash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
may
not
be
bad
,
only
silly
,
you
know
;
and
if
there
is
a
demand
for
*NL*
it
,
I
do
n't
see
any
harm
in
supplying
it
.
Many
very
respectable
people
*NL*
make
an
honest
living
out
of
what
are
called
sensation
stories
,
''
said
*NL*
Jo
,
scratching
gathers
so
energetically
that
a
row
of
little
slits
*NL*
followed
her
pin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
demand
for
whiskey
,
but
I
think
you
and
I
do
not
care
to
*NL*
sell
it
.
If
the
respectable
people
knew
what
harm
they
did
,
they
would
*NL*
not
feel
that
the
living
_
was
_
honest
.
They
haf
no
right
to
put
poison
*NL*
in
the
sugar-plum
,
and
let
the
small
ones
eat
it
.
No
;
they
should
think
*NL*
a
little
,
and
sweep
mud
in
the
street
before
they
do
this
thing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
spoke
warmly
,
and
walked
to
the
fire
,
crumpling
the
paper
in
*NL*
his
hands
.
Jo
sat
still
,
looking
as
if
the
fire
had
come
to
her
;
for
her
*NL*
cheeks
burned
long
after
the
cocked
hat
had
turned
to
smoke
,
and
gone
*NL*
harmlessly
up
the
chimney
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
much
to
send
all
the
rest
after
him
,
''
muttered
the
*NL*
Professor
,
coming
back
with
a
relieved
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
thought
what
a
blaze
her
pile
of
papers
upstairs
would
make
,
and
her
*NL*
hard-earned
money
lay
rather
heavily
on
her
conscience
at
that
minute
.
*NL*
Then
she
thought
consolingly
to
herself
,
``
Mine
are
not
like
that
;
they
*NL*
are
only
silly
,
never
bad
,
so
I
wo
n't
be
worried
;
''
and
taking
up
her
*NL*
book
,
she
said
,
with
a
studious
face
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
go
on
,
sir
?
I
'll
be
very
good
and
proper
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
hope
so
,
''
was
all
he
said
,
but
he
meant
more
than
she
imagined
;
*NL*
and
the
grave
,
kind
look
he
gave
her
made
her
feel
as
if
the
words
*NL*
``
Weekly
Volcano
''
were
printed
in
large
type
on
her
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
went
to
her
room
,
she
got
out
her
papers
,
and
carefully
*NL*
re-read
every
one
of
her
stories
.
Being
a
little
short-sighted
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bhaer
sometimes
used
eye-glasses
,
and
Jo
had
tried
them
once
,
smiling
to
*NL*
see
how
they
magnified
the
fine
print
of
her
book
;
now
she
seemed
to
*NL*
have
got
on
the
Professor
's
mental
or
moral
spectacles
also
;
for
the
*NL*
faults
of
these
poor
stories
glared
at
her
dreadfully
,
and
filled
her
*NL*
with
dismay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
_
are
_
trash
,
and
will
soon
be
worse
than
trash
if
I
go
on
;
for
*NL*
each
is
more
sensational
than
the
last
.
I
've
gone
blindly
on
,
hurting
*NL*
myself
and
other
people
,
for
the
sake
of
money
;
I
know
it
's
so
,
for
I
*NL*
ca
n't
read
this
stuff
in
sober
earnest
without
being
horribly
ashamed
of
*NL*
it
;
and
what
_
should
_
I
do
if
they
were
seen
at
home
,
or
Mr.
Bhaer
got
*NL*
hold
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
turned
hot
at
the
bare
idea
,
and
stuffed
the
whole
bundle
into
her
*NL*
stove
,
nearly
setting
the
chimney
afire
with
the
blaze
.
*NL*
*NL*

stuffed
the

bundle
into

-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
best
place
for
such
inflammable
nonsense
;
I
'd
better
*NL*
burn
the
house
down
,
I
suppose
,
than
let
other
people
blow
themselves
up
*NL*
with
my
gunpowder
,
''
she
thought
,
as
she
watched
the
``
Demon
of
the
Jura
''
*NL*
whisk
away
,
a
little
black
cinder
with
fiery
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
nothing
remained
of
all
her
three
months
'
work
except
a
heap
of
*NL*
ashes
,
and
the
money
in
her
lap
,
Jo
looked
sober
,
as
she
sat
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
wondering
what
she
ought
to
do
about
her
wages
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
have
n't
done
much
harm
_
yet
_
,
and
may
keep
this
to
pay
for
my
*NL*
time
,
''
she
said
,
after
a
long
meditation
,
adding
impatiently
,
``
I
almost
*NL*
wish
I
had
n't
any
conscience
,
it
's
so
inconvenient
.
If
I
did
n't
care
*NL*
about
doing
right
,
and
did
n't
feel
uncomfortable
when
doing
wrong
,
I
*NL*
should
get
on
capitally
.
I
ca
n't
help
wishing
sometimes
,
that
father
and
*NL*
mother
had
n't
been
so
particular
about
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
Jo
,
instead
of
wishing
that
,
thank
God
that
``
father
and
mother
*NL*
_
were
_
particular
,
''
and
pity
from
your
heart
those
who
have
no
such
*NL*
guardians
to
hedge
them
round
with
principles
which
may
seem
like
*NL*
prison-walls
to
impatient
youth
,
but
which
will
prove
sure
foundations
*NL*
to
build
character
upon
in
womanhood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
wrote
no
more
sensational
stories
,
deciding
that
the
money
did
not
*NL*
pay
for
her
share
of
the
sensation
;
but
,
going
to
the
other
extreme
,
as
*NL*
is
the
way
with
people
of
her
stamp
,
she
took
a
course
of
Mrs.
Sherwood
,
*NL*
Miss
Edgeworth
,
and
Hannah
More
;
and
then
produced
a
tale
which
might
*NL*
have
been
more
properly
called
an
essay
or
a
sermon
,
so
intensely
moral
*NL*
was
it
.
She
had
her
doubts
about
it
from
the
beginning
;
for
her
lively
*NL*
fancy
and
girlish
romance
felt
as
ill
at
ease
in
the
new
style
as
she
*NL*
would
have
done
masquerading
in
the
stiff
and
cumbrous
costume
of
the
*NL*
last
century
.
She
sent
this
didactic
gem
to
several
markets
,
but
it
*NL*
found
no
purchaser
;
and
she
was
inclined
to
agree
with
Mr.
Dashwood
,
*NL*
that
morals
did
n't
sell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
tried
a
child
's
story
,
which
she
could
easily
have
disposed
of
*NL*
if
she
had
not
been
mercenary
enough
to
demand
filthy
lucre
for
it
.
The
*NL*
only
person
who
offered
enough
to
make
it
worth
her
while
to
try
*NL*
juvenile
literature
was
a
worthy
gentleman
who
felt
it
his
mission
to
*NL*
convert
all
the
world
to
his
particular
belief
.
But
much
as
she
liked
to
*NL*
write
for
children
,
Jo
could
not
consent
to
depict
all
her
naughty
boys
*NL*
as
being
eaten
by
bears
or
tossed
by
mad
bulls
,
because
they
did
not
go
*NL*
to
a
particular
Sabbath-school
,
nor
all
the
good
infants
,
who
did
go
,
as
*NL*
rewarded
by
every
kind
of
bliss
,
from
gilded
gingerbread
to
escorts
of
*NL*
angels
,
when
they
departed
this
life
with
psalms
or
sermons
on
their
*NL*
lisping
tongues
.
So
nothing
came
of
these
trials
;
and
Jo
corked
up
her
*NL*
inkstand
,
and
said
,
in
a
fit
of
very
wholesome
humility
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
anything
;
I
'll
wait
till
I
do
before
I
try
again
,
and
,
*NL*
meantime
,
`
sweep
mud
in
the
street
,
'
if
I
ca
n't
do
better
;
that
's
*NL*
honest
,
at
least
;
''
which
decision
proved
that
her
second
tumble
down
the
*NL*
bean-stalk
had
done
her
some
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
internal
revolutions
were
going
on
,
her
external
life
had
*NL*
been
as
busy
and
uneventful
as
usual
;
and
if
she
sometimes
looked
*NL*
serious
or
a
little
sad
no
one
observed
it
but
Professor
Bhaer
.
He
did
*NL*
it
so
quietly
that
Jo
never
knew
he
was
watching
to
see
if
she
would
*NL*
accept
and
profit
by
his
reproof
;
but
she
stood
the
test
,
and
he
was
*NL*
satisfied
;
for
,
though
no
words
passed
between
them
,
he
knew
that
she
*NL*
had
given
up
writing
.
Not
only
did
he
guess
it
by
the
fact
that
the
*NL*
second
finger
of
her
right
hand
was
no
longer
inky
,
but
she
spent
her
*NL*
evenings
downstairs
now
,
was
met
no
more
among
newspaper
offices
,
and
*NL*
studied
with
a
dogged
patience
,
which
assured
him
that
she
was
bent
on
*NL*
occupying
her
mind
with
something
useful
,
if
not
pleasant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
helped
her
in
many
ways
,
proving
himself
a
true
friend
,
and
Jo
was
*NL*
happy
;
for
,
while
her
pen
lay
idle
,
she
was
learning
other
lessons
*NL*
beside
German
,
and
laying
a
foundation
for
the
sensation
story
of
her
*NL*
own
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
pleasant
winter
and
a
long
one
,
for
she
did
not
leave
Mrs.
*NL*
Kirke
till
June
.
Every
one
seemed
sorry
when
the
time
came
;
the
children
*NL*
were
inconsolable
,
and
Mr.
Bhaer
's
hair
stuck
straight
up
all
over
his
*NL*
head
,
for
he
always
rumpled
it
wildly
when
disturbed
in
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Going
home
?
Ah
,
you
are
happy
that
you
haf
a
home
to
go
in
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
when
she
told
him
,
and
sat
silently
pulling
his
beard
,
in
the
corner
,
*NL*
while
she
held
a
little
levee
on
that
last
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
going
early
,
so
she
bade
them
all
good-by
over
night
;
and
when
*NL*
his
turn
came
,
she
said
warmly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
sir
,
you
wo
n't
forget
to
come
and
see
us
,
if
you
ever
travel
our
*NL*
way
,
will
you
?
I
'll
never
forgive
you
if
you
do
,
for
I
want
them
all
to
*NL*
know
my
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
?
Shall
I
come
?
''
he
asked
,
looking
down
at
her
with
an
eager
*NL*
expression
which
she
did
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
come
next
month
;
Laurie
graduates
then
,
and
you
'd
enjoy
*NL*
Commencement
as
something
new
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
your
best
friend
,
of
whom
you
speak
?
''
he
said
,
in
an
altered
*NL*
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
boy
Teddy
;
I
'm
very
proud
of
him
,
and
should
like
you
to
see
*NL*
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
looked
up
then
,
quite
unconscious
of
anything
but
her
own
pleasure
in
*NL*
the
prospect
of
showing
them
to
one
another
.
Something
in
Mr.
Bhaer
's
*NL*
face
suddenly
recalled
the
fact
that
she
might
find
Laurie
more
than
a
*NL*
``
best
friend
,
''
and
,
simply
because
she
particularly
wished
not
to
look
*NL*
as
if
anything
was
the
matter
,
she
involuntarily
began
to
blush
;
and
the
*NL*
more
she
tried
not
to
,
the
redder
she
grew
.
If
it
had
not
been
for
Tina
*NL*
on
her
knee
,
she
did
n't
know
what
would
have
become
of
her
.
Fortunately
,
*NL*
the
child
was
moved
to
hug
her
;
so
she
managed
to
hide
her
face
an
*NL*
instant
,
hoping
the
Professor
did
not
see
it
.
But
he
did
,
and
his
own
*NL*
changed
again
from
that
momentary
anxiety
to
its
usual
expression
,
as
he
*NL*
said
cordially
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fear
I
shall
not
make
the
time
for
that
,
but
I
wish
the
friend
much
*NL*
success
,
and
you
all
happiness
.
Gott
bless
you
!
''
and
with
that
,
he
shook
*NL*
hands
warmly
,
shouldered
Tina
,
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
the
boys
were
abed
,
he
sat
long
before
his
fire
,
with
the
*NL*
tired
look
on
his
face
,
and
the
''
_
heimweh
_
,
''
or
homesickness
,
lying
*NL*
heavy
at
his
heart
.
Once
,
when
he
remembered
Jo
,
as
she
sat
with
the
*NL*
little
child
in
her
lap
and
that
new
softness
in
her
face
,
he
leaned
his
*NL*
head
on
his
hands
a
minute
,
and
then
roamed
about
the
room
,
as
if
in
*NL*
search
of
something
that
he
could
not
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
for
me
;
I
must
not
hope
it
now
,
''
he
said
to
himself
,
with
a
*NL*
sigh
that
was
almost
a
groan
;
then
,
as
if
reproaching
himself
for
the
*NL*
longing
that
he
could
not
repress
,
he
went
and
kissed
the
two
towzled
*NL*
heads
upon
the
pillow
,
took
down
his
seldom-used
meerschaum
,
and
opened
*NL*
his
Plato
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
his
best
,
and
did
it
manfully
;
but
I
do
n't
think
he
found
that
a
*NL*
pair
of
rampant
boys
,
a
pipe
,
or
even
the
divine
Plato
,
were
very
*NL*
satisfactory
substitutes
for
wife
and
child
and
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Early
as
it
was
,
he
was
at
the
station
,
next
morning
,
to
see
Jo
off
;
*NL*
and
,
thanks
to
him
,
she
began
her
solitary
journey
with
the
pleasant
*NL*
memory
of
a
familiar
face
smiling
its
farewell
,
a
bunch
of
violets
to
*NL*
keep
her
company
,
and
,
best
of
all
,
the
happy
thought
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
the
winter
's
gone
,
and
I
've
written
no
books
,
earned
no
fortune
;
*NL*
but
I

made

I
'll
try
to
keep
him
all
my

life

Whatever
his
motive
might
have
been
,
Laurie
studied
to
some
purpose
that
*NL*
year
,
for
he
graduated
with
honor
,
and
gave
the
Latin
oration
with
the
*NL*
grace
of
a
Phillips
and
the
eloquence
of
a
Demosthenes
,
so
his
friends
*NL*
said
.
They
were
all
there
,
his
grandfather
,
--
oh
,
so
proud
!
--
Mr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
March
,
John
and
Meg
,
Jo
and
Beth
,
and
all
exulted
over
him
with
the
*NL*
sincere
admiration
which
boys
make
light
of
at
the
time
,
but
fail
to
win
*NL*
from
the
world
by
any
after-triumphs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
to
stay
for
this
confounded
supper
,
but
I
shall
be
home
early
*NL*
to-morrow
;
you
'll
come
and
meet
me
as
usual

girls
?
''
Laurie
said
,
as
he
*NL*
put
the
sisters
into
the
carriage
after
the
joys
of
the
day
were
over
.
*NL*
He
said
``
girls
,
''
but
he
meant
Jo
,
for
she
was
the
only
one
who
kept
up
*NL*
the
old
custom
;
she
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
her
splendid
,
successful
*NL*
boy
anything
,
and
answered
warmly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
come
,
Teddy
,
rain
or
shine
,
and
march
before
you
,
playing
'
_
Hail
*NL*

conquering
hero
comes

,
'
on
a
jews-harp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
thanked
her
with
a
look
that
made
her
think
,
in
a
sudden
panic
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
deary
me
!
I
know
he
'll
say
something
,
and
then
what
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evening
meditation
and
morning
work
somewhat
allayed
her
fears
,
and
*NL*
having
decided
that
she
would
n't
be
vain
enough
to
think
people
were
*NL*
going
to
propose
when
she
had
given
them
every
reason
to
know
what
her
*NL*
answer
would
be
,
she
set
forth
at
the
appointed
time
,
hoping
Teddy
*NL*
would
n't
do
anything
to
make
her
hurt
his
poor
little
feelings
.
A
call
*NL*
at
Meg
's
,
and
a
refreshing
sniff
and
sip
at
the
Daisy
and
Demijohn
,
*NL*
still
further
fortified
her
for
the
_
tete-a-tete
_
,
but
when
she
saw
a
*NL*
stalwart
figure
looming
in
the
distance
,
she
had
a
strong
desire
to
turn
*NL*
about
and
run
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
jews-harp
,
Jo
?
''
cried
Laurie
,
as
soon
as
he
was
within
*NL*
speaking
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
forgot
it
;
''
and
Jo
took
heart
again
,
for
that
salutation
could
not
be
*NL*
called
lover-like
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
always
used
to
take
his
arm
on
these
occasions
;
now
she
did
not
,
and
*NL*
he
made
no
complaint
,
which
was
a
bad
sign
,
but
talked
on
rapidly
about
*NL*
all
sorts
of
far-away
subjects
,
till
they
turned
from
the
road
into
the
*NL*
little
path
that
led
homeward
through
the
grove
.
Then
he
walked
more
*NL*
slowly
,
suddenly
lost
his
fine
flow
of
language
,
and
,
now
and
then
,
a
*NL*
dreadful
pause
occurred
.
To
rescue
the
conversation
from
one
of
the
*NL*
wells
of
silence
into
which
it
kept
falling
,
Jo
said
hastily
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
must
have
a
good
long
holiday
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
intend
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
his
resolute
tone
made
Jo
look
up
quickly
to
find
him
*NL*
looking
down
at
her
with
an
expression
that
assured
her
the
dreaded
*NL*
moment
had
come
,
and
made
her
put
out
her
hand
with
an
imploring
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Teddy
,
please
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
and
you
_
must
_
hear
me
.
It
's
no
use
,
Jo
;
we
've
got
to
have
it
*NL*
out
,
and
the
sooner
the
better
for
both
of
us
,
''
he
answered
,
getting
*NL*
flushed
and
excited
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
what
you
like
,
then
;
I
'll
listen
,
''
said
Jo
,
with
a
desperate
sort
*NL*
of
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
was
a
young
lover
,
but
he
was
in
earnest
,
and
meant
to
``
have
it
*NL*
out
,
''
if
he
died
in
the
attempt
;
so
he
plunged
into
the
subject
with
*NL*
characteristic
impetuosity
,
saying
in
a
voice
that
_
would
_
get
choky
now
*NL*
and
then
,
in
spite
of
manful
efforts
to
keep
it
steady
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
loved
you
ever
since
I
've
known
you
,
Jo
;
could
n't
help
it
,
you
've
*NL*
been
so
good
to
me
.
I
've
tried
to
show
it
,
but
you
would
n't
let
me
;
now
*NL*
I
'm
going
to
make
you
hear
,
and
give
me
an
answer
,
for
I
_
ca
n't
_
go
on
*NL*
so
any
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
save
you
this
;
I
thought
you
'd
understand
--
''
began
Jo
,
*NL*
finding
it
a
great
deal
harder
than
she
expected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
did
;
but
girls
are
so
queer
you
never
know
what
they
mean
.
*NL*
They
say
No
when
they
mean
Yes
,
and
drive
a
man
out
of
his
wits
just
for
*NL*
the
fun
of
it
,
''
returned
Laurie
,
entrenching
himself
behind
an
*NL*
undeniable
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
do
n't
.
I
never
wanted
to
make
you
care
for
me
so
,
and
I
went
away
*NL*
to
keep
you
from
it
if
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
;
it
was
like
you
,
but
it
was
no
use
.
I
only
loved
you
all
*NL*
the
more
,
and
I
worked
hard
to
please
you
,
and
I
gave
up
billiards
and
*NL*
everything
you
did
n't
like
,
and
waited
and
never
complained
,
for
I
hoped
*NL*
you
'd
love
me
,
though
I
'm
not
half
good
enough
--
''
here
there
was
a
choke
*NL*
that
could
n't
be
controlled
,
so
he
decapitated
buttercups
while
he
*NL*
cleared
his
``
confounded
throat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
are
;
you
're
a
great
deal
too
good
for
me
,
and
I
'm
so
grateful
*NL*
to
you
,
and
so
proud
and
fond
of
you
,
I
do
n't
see
why
I
ca
n't
love
you
*NL*
as
you
want
me
to
.
I
've
tried
,
but
I
ca
n't
change
the
feeling
,
and
it
*NL*
would
be
a
lie
to
say
I
do
when
I
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
truly
,
Jo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
short
,
and
caught
both
her
hands
as
he
put
his
question
with
*NL*
a
look
that
she
did
not
soon
forget
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
truly
,
dear

*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
the
grove
now
,
close
by
the
stile
;
and
when
the
last
words
*NL*
fell
reluctantly
from
Jo
's
lips
,
Laurie
dropped
her
hands
and
turned
as
*NL*
if
to
go
on
,
but
for
once
in
his
life
that
fence
was
too
much
for
him
;
*NL*
so
he
just
laid
his
head
down
on
the
mossy
post
,
and
stood
so
still
that
*NL*
Jo
was
frightened
.

do
any
good

I
wish
you
would
n't
take
it
so
hard

I
ca
n't
help
it
;
*NL*
you
know
it
's
impossible
for
people
to
make
themselves
love
other
people
*NL*
if
they
do
n't

''
cried
Jo
inelegantly
but
remorsefully
,
as
she
softly
*NL*
patted
his
shoulder
,
remembering
the
time
when
he
had
comforted
her
so
*NL*
long
ago
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
sometimes
,
''
said
a
muffled
voice
from
the
post
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
's
the
right
sort
of
love

I
'd
rather
not
try

it

was
the
decided
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
long
pause
,
while
a
blackbird
sung
blithely
on
the
willow
by
*NL*
the
river
,
and
the
tall
grass
rustled
in
the
wind
.
Presently
Jo
said
*NL*
very
soberly
,
as
she
sat
down
on
the
step
of
the
stile
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laurie
,
I
want
to
tell
you
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
as
if
he
had
been
shot
,
threw
up
his
head
,
and
cried
out
,
in
*NL*
a
fierce
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Do
n't
_
tell
me
that
,
Jo
;
I
ca
n't
bear
it
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
what
?
''
she
asked
,
wondering
at
his
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you
love
that
old
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
old
man
?
''
demanded
Jo
,
thinking
he
must
mean
his
grandfather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
devilish
Professor
you
were
always
writing
about
.
If
you
say
you
*NL*
love
him
,
I
know
I
shall
do
something
desperate
;
''
and
he
looked
as
if
he
*NL*
would
keep
his
word
,
as
he
clenched
his
hands
,
with
a
wrathful
spark
in
*NL*
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
wanted
to
laugh
,
but
restrained
herself
,
and
said
warmly
,
for
she
,
*NL*
too
,
was
getting
excited
with
all
this
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
swear

next

Pray

do
n't
fly
into
a
*NL*
passion
;
I
want
to
be
kind

but
I
know
I
shall
get
angry
if
you
abuse

Professor

the

idea

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
after
a
while
,
and
then
what
will
become
of
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``

'll
love
some

all
this

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
ca
n't

any

and
I
'll
never
forget

*NL*
never

''
with
a
stamp
to
emphasize
his
passionate
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
_
shall
_
I
do
with
him
?
''
sighed
Jo
,
finding
that
emotions
were
more
*NL*
unmanageable
than
she
expected
.
``
You
have
n't
heard
what
I
wanted
to
tell
*NL*
you
.
Sit
down
and
listen
;
for
indeed
I
want
to
do
right
and
make
you
*NL*
happy
,
''
she
said
,
hoping
to
soothe
him
with
a
little
reason
,
which
*NL*
proved
that
she
knew
nothing
about
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
a
ray
of
hope
in
that
last
speech
,
Laurie
threw
himself
down
on
*NL*
the
grass
at
her
feet
,
leaned
his
arm
on
the
lower
step
of
the
stile
,
*NL*
and
looked
up
at
her
with
an
expectant
face
.
Now
that
arrangement
was
*NL*
not
conducive
to
calm
speech
or
clear
thought
on
Jo
's
part
;
for
how
*NL*
_
could
_
she
say
hard
things
to
her
boy
while
he
watched
her
with
eyes
*NL*
full
of
love
and
longing
,
and
lashes
still
wet
with
the
bitter
drop
or
*NL*
two
her
hardness
of
heart
had
wrung
from
him
?
She
gently
turned
his
head
*NL*
away
,
saying
,
as
she
stroked
the
wavy
hair
which
had
been
allowed
to
*NL*
grow
for
her
sake
,
--
how
touching
that
was
,
to
be
sure
!
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
agree
with
mother
that
you
and
I
are
not
suited
to
each
other
,
*NL*
because
our
quick
tempers
and
strong
wills
would
probably
make
us
very
*NL*
miserable
,
if
we
were
so
foolish
as
to
--
''
Jo
paused
a
little
over
the
*NL*
last
word
,
but
Laurie
uttered
it
with
a
rapturous
expression
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marry
,
--
no
,
we
should
n't
!
If
you
loved
me

Jo
,
I
should
be
a

saint
,
for
you

make
me
anything
you
like

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
ca
n't

've
tried
it
and
failed

and
I
wo
n't
risk
our
happiness
*NL*
by
such
a
serious
experiment
.
We
do
n't
agree
and
we
never
shall
;
so
*NL*
we
'll
be
good
friends
all
our
lives
,
but
we
wo
n't
go
and
do
anything
*NL*
rash
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
we
will
if
we
get
the
chance
,
''
muttered
Laurie
rebelliously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
do
be
reasonable
,
and
take
a
sensible
view
of
the
case

''
implored
*NL*
Jo
,
almost
at
her
wit
's
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
be
reasonable

I
do
n't
want
to

call

view

it
wo

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
little
quiver
in
Jo
's
voice
,
and
,
thinking
it
a
good
omen
,
*NL*
Laurie
turned
round
,
bringing
all
his
persuasive
powers
to
bear
as
he
*NL*
said
,
in
the
wheedlesome
tone
that
had
never
been
so

*NL*
``
Do
n't

us

dear

Every

*NL*
Not
until
months
afterward
did
Jo
understand
how
she
had
the
strength
of
*NL*
mind
to
hold
fast
to
the
resolution
she
had
made
when
she
decided
that
*NL*
she
did
not
love
her
boy
,
and
never
could
.
It
was
very
hard
to
do
,
but
*NL*
she
did
it
,
knowing
that
delay
was
both
useless
and
cruel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
`
Yes
'
truly
,
so
I
wo
n't
say
it
at
all
.
You
'll
see
that
I
'm
*NL*
right
,
by
and
by
,
and
thank
me
for
it
''
--
she
began
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
hanged
if
I
do
!
''
and
Laurie
bounced
up
off
the
grass
,
burning
*NL*
with
indignation
at
the
bare
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
will
!
''
persisted
Jo
;
``
you
'll
get
over
this
after
a
while
,
and
*NL*
find
some
lovely
,
accomplished
girl
,
who
will
adore
you
,
and
make
a
fine
*NL*
mistress
for
your
fine
house
.
I
should
n't
.
I
'm
homely
and
awkward
and
*NL*
odd
and
old
,
and
you
'd
be
ashamed
of
me
,
and
we
should
quarrel
,
--
we
*NL*
ca
n't
help
it
even
now
,
you
see
,
--
and
I
should
n't
like
elegant
society
*NL*
and
you
would
,
and
you
'd
hate
my
scribbling
,
and
I
could
n't
get
on
*NL*
without
it
,
and
we
should
be
unhappy
,
and
wish
we
had
n't
done
it
,
and
*NL*
everything
would
be
horrid
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
more
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
finding
it
hard
to
listen
patiently
to
*NL*
this
prophetic
burst
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
more
,
except
that
I
do
n't
believe
I
shall
ever
marry
.
I
'm
happy
*NL*
as
I
am
,
and
love
my
liberty
too
well
to
be
in
any
hurry
to
give
it
up
*NL*
for
any
mortal
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
better
!
''
broke
in
Laurie
.
``
You
think
so
now
;
but
there
'll
come
a
*NL*
time
when
you
_
will
_
care
for
somebody
,
and
you
'll
love
him
*NL*
tremendously
,
and
live
and
die
for
him
.
I
know
you
will
,
it
's
your
way
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
have
to
stand
by
and
see
it
;
''
and
the
despairing
lover
cast
*NL*
his
hat
upon
the
ground
with
a
gesture
that
would
have
seemed
comical
,
*NL*
if
his
face
had
not
been
so
tragical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
_
will
_
live
and
die
for
him
,
if
he
ever
comes
and
makes
me
love
*NL*
him
in
spite
of
myself
,
and
you
must
do
the
best
you
can
!
''
cried
Jo
,
*NL*
losing
patience
with
poor
Teddy
.
``
I
've
done
my
best
,
but
you
_
wo
n't
_
be
*NL*
reasonable
,
and
it
's
selfish
of
you
to
keep
teasing
for
what
I
ca
n't
*NL*
give
.
I
shall
always
be
fond
of
you
,
very
fond
indeed
,
as
a
friend
,
but
*NL*
I
'll
never
marry
you
;
and
the
sooner
you
believe
it
,
the
better
for
both
*NL*
of
us
,
--
so
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
speech
was
like
fire
to
gunpowder
.
Laurie
looked
at
her
a
minute
as
*NL*
if
he
did
not
quite
know
what
to
do
with
himself
,
then
turned
sharply
*NL*
away
,
saying
,
in
a
desperate
sort
of
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
be
sorry
some
day
,
Jo
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
where
are
you
going
?
''
she
cried
,
for
his
face
frightened
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
the
devil
!
''
was
the
consoling
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
minute
Jo
's
heart
stood
still
,
as
he
swung
himself
down
the
bank
,
*NL*
toward
the
river
;
but
it
takes
much
folly
,
sin
,
or
misery
to
send
a
*NL*
young
man
to
a
violent
death
,
and
Laurie
was
not
one
of
the
weak
sort
*NL*
who
are
conquered
by
a
single
failure
.
He
had
no
thought
of
a
*NL*
melodramatic
plunge
,
but
some
blind
instinct
led
him
to
fling
hat
and
*NL*
coat
into
his
boat
,
and
row
away
with
all
his
might
,
making
better
time
*NL*
up
the
river
than
he
had
done
in
many
a
race
.
Jo
drew
a
long
breath
and
*NL*
unclasped
her
hands
as
she
watched
the
poor
fellow
trying
to
outstrip
*NL*
the
trouble
which
he
carried
in
his
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
him
good
,
and
he
'll
come
home
in
such
a
tender
,
penitent
*NL*
state
of
mind
,
that
I
sha
'n'
t
dare
to
see
him
,
''
she
said
;
adding
,
as
she
*NL*
went
slowly
home
,
feeling
as
if
she
had
murdered
some
innocent
thing
,
*NL*
and
buried
it
under
the
leaves
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
must
go
and
prepare
Mr.
Laurence
to
be
very
kind
to
my
poor
boy
.
*NL*
I
wish
he
'd
love
Beth
;
perhaps
he
may
,
in
time
,
but
I
begin
to
think
I
*NL*
was
mistaken
about
her
.
Oh
dear
!
how
can
girls
like
to
have
lovers
and
*NL*
refuse
them
.
I
think
it
's
dreadful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
sure
that
no
one
could
do
it
so
well
as
herself
,
she
went
straight
*NL*
to
Mr.
Laurence
,
told
the
hard
story
bravely
through
,
and
then
broke
*NL*
down
,
crying
so
dismally
over
her
own
insensibility
that
the
kind
old
*NL*
gentleman
,
though
sorely
disappointed
,
did
not
utter
a
reproach
.
He
*NL*
found
it
difficult
to
understand
how
any
girl
could
help
loving
Laurie
,
*NL*
and
hoped
she
would
change
her
mind
,
but
he
knew
even
better
than
Jo
*NL*
that
love
can
not
be
forced
,
so
he
shook
his
head
sadly
,
and
resolved
to
*NL*
carry
his
boy
out
of
harm
's
way
;
for
Young
Impetuosity
's
parting
words
*NL*
to
Jo
disturbed
him
more
than
he
would
confess
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Laurie
came
home
,
dead
tired
,
but
quite
composed
,
his
grandfather
*NL*
met
him
as
if
he
knew
nothing
,
and
kept
up
the
delusion
very
*NL*
successfully
for
an
hour
or
two
.
But
when
they
sat
together
in
the
*NL*
twilight
,
the
time
they
used
to
enjoy
so
much
,
it
was
hard
work
for
the
*NL*
old
man
to
ramble
on
as
usual
,
and
harder
still
for
the
young
one
to
*NL*
listen
to
praises
of
the
last
year
's
success
,
which
to
him
now
seemed
*NL*
love
's
labor
lost
.
He
bore
it
as
long
as
he
could
,
then
went
to
his
*NL*
piano
,
and
began
to
play
.
The
windows
were
open
;
and
Jo
,
walking
in
the
*NL*
garden
with
Beth
,
for
once
understood
music
better
than
her
sister
,
for
*NL*
he
played
the
``
Sonata
Pathetique
,
''
and
played
it
as
he
never
did
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
fine
,
I
dare
say
,
but
it
's
sad
enough
to
make
one
cry
;
give
*NL*
us
something
gayer
,
lad
,
''
said
Mr.
Laurence
,
whose
kind
old
heart
was
*NL*
full
of
sympathy
,
which
he
longed
to
show
,
but
knew
not
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
dashed
into
a
livelier
strain
,
played
stormily
for
several
*NL*
minutes
,
and
would
have
got
through
bravely
,
if
,
in
a
momentary
lull
,
*NL*
Mrs.
March
's
voice
had
not
been
heard
calling
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
dear
,
come
in
;
I
want
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Just
what
Laurie
longed
to
say
,
with
a
different
meaning
!
As
he
*NL*
listened
,
he
lost
his
place
;
the
music
ended
with
a
broken
chord
,
and
*NL*
the
musician
sat
silent
in
the
dark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stand
this
,
''
muttered
the
old
gentleman
.
Up
he
got
,
groped
his
*NL*
way
to
the
piano
,
laid
a
kind
hand
on
either
of
the
broad
shoulders
,
and
*NL*
said
,
as
gently
as
a
woman
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
my
boy
,
I
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
for
an
instant
;
then
Laurie
asked
sharply
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
told
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
there
's
an
end
of
it
!
''
and
he
shook
off
his
grandfather
's
hands
*NL*
with
an
impatient
motion
;
for
,
though
grateful
for
the
sympathy
,
his
*NL*
man
's
pride
could
not
bear
a
man
's
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
quite
;
I
want
to
say
one
thing
,
and
then
there
shall
be
an
end
of
*NL*
it
,
''
returned
Mr.
Laurence
,
with
unusual
mildness
.
``
You
wo
n't
care
to
*NL*
stay
at
home
just
now
,
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
intend
to
run
away
from
a
girl
.
Jo
ca
n't
prevent
my
seeing
her
,
*NL*
and
I
shall
stay
and
do
it
as
long
as
I
like
,
''
interrupted
Laurie
,
in
a
*NL*
defiant
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
are
the
gentleman
I
think
you
.
I
'm
disappointed
,
but
the
*NL*
girl
ca
n't
help
it
;
and
the
only
thing
left
for
you
to
do
is
to
go
away
*NL*
for
a
time
.
Where
will
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anywhere
.
I
do
n't
care
what
becomes
of
me
;
''
and
Laurie
got
up
,
with
a
*NL*
reckless
laugh
,
that
grated
on
his
grandfather
's
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
like
a
man
,
and
do
n't
do
anything
rash
,
for
God
's
sake
.
Why
not
*NL*
go
abroad
,
as
you
planned
,
and
forget
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
've
been
wild
to
go
,
and
I
promised
you
should
when
you
got
*NL*
through
college
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
but
I
did
n't
mean
to
go
alone
!
''
and
Laurie
walked
fast
through
the
*NL*
room
,
with
an
expression
which
it
was
well
his
grandfather
did
not
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
ask
you
to
go
alone
;
there
's
some
one
ready
and
glad
to
go
with
*NL*
you
,
anywhere
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
,
sir
?
''
stopping
to
listen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
came
back
as
quickly
as
he
went
,
and
put
out
his
hand
,
saying
*NL*
huskily
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
a
selfish
brute
;
but
--
you
know
--
grandfather
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lord
help
me
,
yes
,
I
do
know

for
I
've
been
through
it
all
before

once
*NL*
in
my
own
young
days
,
and
then
with
your
father
.
Now
,
my
dear
boy
,
just
*NL*
sit
quietly
down
,
and
hear
my
plan
.
It
's
all
settled
,
and
can
be
carried
*NL*
out
at
once
,
''
said
Mr.
Laurence
,
keeping
hold
of
the
young
man
,
as
if
*NL*
fearful
that
he
would
break
away
,
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
sir
,
what
is
it
?
''
and
Laurie
sat
down
,
without
a
sign
of
interest
*NL*
in
face
or
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
business
in
London
that
needs
looking
after
;
I
meant
you
*NL*
should
attend
to
it
;
but
I
can
do
it
better
myself
,
and
things
here
will
*NL*
get
on
very
well
with
Brooke
to
manage
them
.
My
partners
do
almost
*NL*
everything
;
I
'm
merely
holding
on
till
you
take
my
place
,
and
can
be
off
*NL*
at
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
hate
travelling
,
sir
;
I
ca
n't
ask
it
of
you
at
your
age
,
''
began
*NL*
Laurie
,
who
was
grateful
for
the
sacrifice
,
but
much
preferred
to
go
*NL*
alone
,
if
he
went
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
gentleman
knew
that
perfectly
well
,
and
particularly
desired
to
*NL*
prevent
it
;
for
the
mood
in
which
he
found
his
grandson
assured
him
that
*NL*
it
would
not
be
wise
to
leave
him
to
his
own
devices
.
So
,
stifling
a
*NL*
natural
regret
at
the
thought
of
the
home
comforts
he
would
leave
behind
*NL*
him
,
he
said
stoutly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bless
your
soul
,
I
'm
not
superannuated
yet
.
I
quite
enjoy
the
idea
;
it
*NL*
will
do
me
good
,
and
my
old
bones
wo
n't
suffer
,
for
travelling
nowadays
*NL*
is
almost
as
easy
as
sitting
in
a
chair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
restless
movement
from
Laurie
suggested
that
_
his
_
chair
was
not
easy
,
*NL*
or
that
he
did
not
like
the
plan
,
and
made
the
old
man
add
hastily
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
to
be
a
marplot
or
a
burden
;
I
go
because
I
think
you
'd
*NL*
feel
happier
than
if
I
was
left
behind
.
I
do
n't
intend
to
gad
about
with
*NL*
you
,
but
leave
you
free
to
go
where
you
like
,
while
I
amuse
myself
in
my
*NL*
own
way
.
I
've
friends
in
London
and
Paris
,
and
should
like
to
visit
*NL*
them
;
meantime
you
can
go
to
Italy
,
Germany
,
Switzerland
,
where
you
*NL*
will
,
and
enjoy
pictures
,
music
,
scenery
,
and
adventures
to
your
heart
's
*NL*
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Laurie
felt
just
then
that
his
heart
was
entirely
broken
,
and
the
*NL*
world
a
howling
wilderness
;
but
at
the
sound
of
certain
words
which
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
artfully
introduced
into
his
closing
sentence
,
the
broken
*NL*
heart
gave
an
unexpected
leap
,
and
a
green

suddenly
*NL*
appeared
in
the
howling
wilderness
.
He
sighed
,
and
then
said
,
in
a
*NL*
spiritless
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
you
like

;
it
does
n't
matter
where
I
go
or
what
I
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
to
me
,
remember
that
,
my
lad
;
I
give
you
entire
liberty
,
but
I
*NL*
trust
you
to
make
an
honest
use
of
it
.
Promise
me
that

Laurie

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anything
you
like
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
,
''
thought
the
old
gentleman
.
``
You
do
n't
care
now
,
but
there
'll
*NL*
come
a
time
when
that
promise
will
keep
you
out
of
mischief
,
or
I
'm
much
*NL*
mistaken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
an
energetic
individual
,
Mr.
Laurence
struck
while
the
iron
was
*NL*
hot
;
and
before
the
blighted
being
recovered
spirit
enough
to
rebel
,
*NL*
they
were
off
.
During
the
time
necessary
for
preparation
,
Laurie
bore
*NL*
himself
as
young
gentlemen
usually
do
in
such
cases
.
He
was
moody
,
*NL*
irritable
,
and
pensive
by
turns
;
lost
his
appetite
,
neglected
his
dress
,
*NL*
and
devoted
much
time
to
playing
tempestuously
on
his
piano
;
avoided
Jo
,
*NL*
but
consoled
himself
by
staring
at
her
from
his
window
,
with
a
tragical
*NL*
face
that
haunted
her
dreams
by
night
,
and
oppressed
her
with
a
heavy
*NL*
sense
of
guilt
by
day
.
Unlike
some
sufferers
,
he
never
spoke
of
his
*NL*
unrequited
passion
,
and
would
allow
no
one
,
not
even
Mrs.
March
,
to
*NL*
attempt
consolation
or
offer
sympathy
.
On
some
accounts
,
this
was
a
*NL*
relief
to
his
friends
;
but
the
weeks
before
his
departure
were
very
*NL*
uncomfortable
,
and
every
one
rejoiced
that
the
``
poor
,
dear
fellow
was
*NL*
going
away
to
forget
his
trouble
,
and
come
home
happy
.
''
Of
course
,
he
*NL*
smiled
darkly
at
their
delusion
,
but
passed
it
by
,
with
the
sad
*NL*
superiority
of
one
who
knew
that
his
fidelity
,
like
his
love
,
was
*NL*
unalterable
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
parting
came
he
affected
high
spirits
,
to
conceal
certain
*NL*
inconvenient
emotions
which
seemed
inclined
to
assert
themselves
.
This
*NL*
gayety
did
not
impose
upon
anybody
,
but
they
tried
to
look
as
if
it
did
,
*NL*
for
his
sake
,
and
he
got
on
very
well
till
Mrs.
March
kissed
him
,
with
*NL*
a
whisper
full
of
motherly
solicitude
;
then
,
feeling
that
he
was
going
*NL*
very
fast
,
he
hastily
embraced
them
all
round
,
not
forgetting
the
*NL*
afflicted
Hannah
,
and
ran
downstairs
as
if
for
his
life
.
Jo
followed
a
*NL*
minute
after
to
wave
her
hand
to
him
if
he
looked
round
.
He
did
look
*NL*
round
,
came
back
,
put
his
arms
about
her
,
as
she
stood
on
the
step
above
*NL*
him
,
and
looked
up
at
her
with
a
face
that
made
his
short
appeal
both
*NL*
eloquent
and
pathetic
.
*NL*
*NL*

Jo

That
was
all
,
except
a
little
pause
;
then
Laurie
straightened
himself
*NL*
up
,
said
``
It
's
all

never

and
went
away
without
another
*NL*
word
.
Ah
,
but
it
was
n't
all
right
,
and
Jo
_
did
_
mind
;
for
while
the
*NL*
curly
head
lay
on
her
arm
a
minute
after
her
hard
answer
,
she
felt
as
if
*NL*
she
had
stabbed
her
dearest
friend
;
and
when
he
left
her
without
a
look

behind
him
,
she
knew
that
the
boy

never
would
come
again

BETH
'S
SECRET
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jo
came
home
that
spring
,
she
had
been
struck
with
the
change
in
*NL*
Beth
.
No
one
spoke
of
it
or
seemed
aware
of
it
,
for
it
had
come
too
*NL*
gradually
to
startle
those
who
saw
her
daily
;
but
to
eyes
sharpened
by
*NL*
absence
,
it
was
very
plain
;
and
a
heavy
weight
fell
on
Jo
's
heart
as
she
*NL*
saw
her
sister
's
face
.
It
was
no
paler
and
but
little
thinner
than
in
*NL*
the
autumn
;
yet
there
was
a
strange
,
transparent
look
about
it
,
as
if
*NL*
the
mortal
was
being
slowly
refined
away
,
and
the
immortal
shining
*NL*
through
the
frail
flesh
with
an
indescribably
pathetic
beauty
.
Jo
saw
*NL*
and
felt
it
,
but
said
nothing
at
the
time
,
and
soon
the
first
impression
*NL*
lost
much
of
its
power
;
for
Beth
seemed
happy
,
no
one
appeared
to
doubt
*NL*
that
she
was
better
;
and
,
presently
,
in
other
cares
,
Jo
for
a
time
*NL*
forgot
her
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
Laurie
was
gone
,
and
peace
prevailed
again
,
the
vague
anxiety
*NL*
returned
and
haunted
her
.
She
had
confessed
her
sins
and
been
forgiven
;
*NL*
but
when
she
showed
her
savings
and
proposed
the
mountain
trip
,
Beth
had
*NL*
thanked
her
heartily
,
but
begged
not
to
go
so
far
away
from
home
.
*NL*
Another
little
visit
to
the
seashore
would
suit
her
better
,
and
,
as
*NL*
grandma
could
not
be
prevailed
upon
to
leave
the
babies
,
Jo
took
Beth
*NL*
down
to
the
quiet
place
,
where
she
could
live
much
in
the
open
air
,
and
*NL*
let
the
fresh
sea-breezes
blow
a
little
color
into
her
pale
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
fashionable
place
,
but
,
even
among
the
pleasant
people
*NL*
there
,
the
girls
made
few
friends
,
preferring
to
live
for
one
another
.
*NL*
Beth
was
too
shy
to
enjoy
society
,
and
Jo
too
wrapped
up
in
her
to
care
*NL*
for
any
one
else
;
so
they
were
all
in
all
to
each
other
,
and
came
and
*NL*
went
,
quite
unconscious
of
the
interest
they
excited
in
those
about
*NL*
them
,
who
watched
with
sympathetic
eyes
the
strong
sister
and
the
feeble
*NL*
one
,
always
together
,
as
if
they
felt
instinctively
that
a
long
*NL*
separation
was
not
far
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
feel
it
,
yet
neither
spoke
of
it
;
for
often
between
ourselves
*NL*
and
those
nearest
and
dearest
to
us
there
exists
a
reserve
which
it
is
*NL*
very
hard
to
overcome
.
Jo
felt
as
if
a
veil
had
fallen
between
her
heart
*NL*
and
Beth
's
;
but
when
she
put
out
her
hand
to
lift
it
up
,
there
seemed
*NL*
something
sacred
in
the
silence
,
and
she
waited
for
Beth
to
speak
.
She
*NL*
wondered
,
and
was
thankful
also
,
that
her
parents
did
not
seem
to
see
*NL*
what
she
saw
;
and
,
during
the
quiet
weeks
,
when
the
shadow
grew
so
plain
*NL*
to
her
,
she
said
nothing
of
it
to
those
at
home
,
believing
that
it
would
*NL*
tell
itself
when
Beth
came
back
no
better
.
She
wondered
still
more
if
*NL*
her
sister
really
guessed
the
hard
truth
,
and
what
thoughts
were
passing
*NL*
through
her
mind
during
the
long
hours
when
she
lay
on
the
warm
rocks
,
*NL*
with
her
head
in
Jo
's
lap
,
while
the
winds
blew
healthfully
over
her
,
*NL*
and
the
sea
made
music
at
her
feet
.

*NL*
One
day
Beth
told
her
.
Jo
thought
she
was
asleep
,
she
lay
so
still
;
and
,
*NL*
putting
down
her
book
,
sat
looking
at
her
with
wistful
eyes
,
trying
to
*NL*
see
signs
of
hope
in
the
faint
color
on
Beth
's
cheeks
.
But
she
could
not
*NL*
find
enough
to
satisfy
her
,
for
the
cheeks
were
very
thin
,
and
the
hands
*NL*
seemed
too
feeble
to
hold
even
the
rosy
little
shells
they
had
been
*NL*
gathering
.
It
came
to
her
then
more
bitterly
than
ever
that
Beth
was
*NL*
slowly
drifting
away
from
her
,
and
her
arms
instinctively
tightened
*NL*
their
hold
upon
the
dearest
treasure
she
possessed
.
For
a
minute
her
*NL*
eyes
were
too
dim
for
seeing
,
and
,
when
they
cleared
,
Beth
was
looking
*NL*
up
at
her
so
tenderly
that
there
was
hardly
any
need
for
her
to
say
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
dear
,
I
'm
glad
you
know
it
.
I
've
tried
to
tell
you
,
but
I
*NL*
could
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
answer
except
her
sister
's
cheek
against
her
own
,
not
even
*NL*
tears
;
for
when
most
deeply
moved
,
Jo
did
not
cry
.
She
was
the
weaker
,
*NL*
then
,
and
Beth
tried
to
comfort
and
sustain
her
,
with
her
arms
about
*NL*
her
,
and
the
soothing
words
she
whispered
in
her
ear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
known
it
for
a
good
while
,
dear
,
and
,
now
I
'm
used
to
it
,
it
is
n't
*NL*
hard
to
think
of
or
to
bear
.
Try
to
see
it
so
,
and
do
n't
be
troubled
*NL*
about
me
,
because
it
's
best
;
indeed
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
this
what
made
you
so
unhappy
in
the
autumn
,
Beth
?
You
did
not
feel
*NL*
it
then
,
and
keep
it
to
yourself
so
long
,
did
you
?
''
asked
Jo
,
refusing
*NL*
to
see
or
say
that
it
_
was
_
best
,
but
glad
to
know
that
Laurie
had
no
*NL*
part
in
Beth
's
trouble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
gave
up
hoping
then
,
but
I
did
n't
like
to
own
it

I
tried
to
*NL*
think
it
was
a
sick
fancy
,
and
would
not
let
it
trouble
any
one
.
But
*NL*
when
I
saw
you
all
so
well
and
strong
,
and
full
of
happy
plans
,
it
was
*NL*
hard
to
feel
that
I
could
never
be
like

then
I
was
miserable

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Beth

you
did

tell

did

*NL*
could
you
shut
me
out
,
and
bear
it
all
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
voice
was
full
of
tender
reproach
,
and
her
heart
ached
to
think
of
*NL*
the
solitary
struggle
that
must
have
gone
on
while
Beth
learned
to
say
*NL*
good-by
to
health
,
love
,
and
life
,
and
take
up
her
cross
so
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
was
wrong

I
tried
to
do
right

I

n't

said
anything

I
hoped
I
was

cried
Jo
,
glad
to
say
all

truth

*NL*
Beth
looked
so
amazed
at

idea
that
Jo
smiled
in
spite
of
her
pain
,
*NL*
and
added
softly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
did
n't

I
was
afraid

love-lornity
all

``

as

``

do

can

he
never

I

hope
he
truly

''
*NL*

``

said
Jo
decidedly
.
``

I

lose

feel
*NL*
more
sure
that
I
shall
never

cried
poor
*NL*
Jo
rebelliously
,
for
her
spirit
was
far
less
piously
submissive
than
*NL*
Beth
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Simple
,
sincere
people
seldom
speak
much
of
their
piety
;
it
shows
itself
*NL*
in
acts
,
rather
than
in
words
,
and
has
more
influence
than
homilies
or
*NL*
protestations
.
Beth
could
not
reason
upon
or
explain
the
faith
that
gave
*NL*
her
courage
and
patience
to
give
up
life
,
and
cheerfully
wait
for
death
.
*NL*
Like
a
confiding
child
,
she
asked
no
questions
,
but
left
everything
to
*NL*
God
and
nature
,
Father
and
mother
of
us
all
,
feeling
sure
that
they
,
and
*NL*
they
only
,
could
teach
and
strengthen
heart
and
spirit
for
this
life
and
*NL*
the
life
to
come
.
She
did
not
rebuke
Jo
with
saintly
speeches
,
only
*NL*
loved
her
better
for
her
passionate
affection
,
and
clung
more
closely
to
*NL*
the
dear
human
love
,
from
which
our
Father
never
means
us
to
be
weaned
,
*NL*
but
through
which
He
draws
us
closer
to
Himself
.
She
could
not
say
,
``
I

*NL*
glad
to
go
,
''
for
life
was
very
sweet
to
her
;
she
could
only
sob
out
,
``
I
*NL*
try
to
be
willing
,
''
while
she
held
fast
to
Jo
,
as
the
first
bitter
wave
*NL*
of
this
great
sorrow
broke
over
them
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
Beth
said
,
with
recovered
serenity
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
tell
them
this
when
we
go
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
they
will
see
it
without
words
,
''
sighed
Jo
;
for
now
it
seemed
*NL*
to
her
that
Beth
changed
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
;
I
've
heard
that
the
people
who
love
best
are
often
*NL*
blindest
to
such
things
.
If
they
do
n't
see
it
,
you
will
tell
them
for
*NL*
me
.
I
do
n't
want
any
secrets
,
and
it
's
kinder
to
prepare
them
.
Meg
has
*NL*
John
and
the
babies
to
comfort
her
,
but
you
must
stand
by
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
wo
n't
you
,
Jo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
can
;
but
,
Beth
,
I
do
n't
give
up
yet
;
I
'm
going
to
believe
that
it
*NL*
_
is
_
a
sick
fancy
,
and
not
let
you
think
it
's
true
,
''
said
Jo
,
trying
to
*NL*
speak
cheerfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beth
lay
a
minute
thinking
,
and
then
said
in
her
quiet
way
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
how
to
express
myself
,
and
should
n't
try
,
to
any
one
but
*NL*
you
,
because
I
ca
n't
speak
out
,
except
to
my
Jo
.
I
only
mean
to
say
*NL*
that
I
have
a
feeling
that
it
never
was
intended
I
should
live
long
.
I
'm
*NL*
not
like
the
rest
of
you
;
I
never
made
any
plans
about
what
I
'd
do
when
*NL*
I
grew
up
;
I
never
thought
of
being
married
,
as
you
all
did
.
I
could
n't
*NL*
seem
to
imagine
myself
anything
but
stupid
little
Beth
,
trotting
about
*NL*
at
home
,
of
no
use
anywhere
but
there
.
I
never
wanted
to
go
away
,
and
*NL*
the
hard
part
now
is
the
leaving
you
all
.
I
'm
not
afraid
,
but
it
seems
*NL*
as
if
I
should
be
homesick
for
you
even
in
heaven
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
could
not
speak
;
and
for
several
minutes
there
was
no
sound
but
the
*NL*
sigh
of
the
wind
and
the
lapping
of
the
tide
.
A
white-winged
gull
flew
*NL*
by
,
with
the
flash
of
sunshine
on
its
silvery
breast
;
Beth
watched
it
*NL*
till
it
vanished
,
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
sadness
.
A
little
*NL*
gray-coated
sand-bird
came
tripping
over
the
beach
,
``
peeping
''
softly
to
*NL*
itself
,
as
if
enjoying
the
sun
and
sea
;
it
came
quite
close
to
Beth
,
*NL*
looked
at
her
with
a
friendly
eye
,
and
sat
upon
a
warm
stone
,
dressing
*NL*
its
wet
feathers
,
quite
at
home
.
Beth
smiled
,
and
felt
comforted
,
for
*NL*
the
tiny
thing
seemed
to
offer
its
small
friendship
,
and
remind
her
that
*NL*
a
pleasant
world
was
still
to
be
enjoyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
little
bird
!
See
,
Jo
,
how
tame
it
is
.
I
like
peeps
better
than
the
*NL*
gulls
:
they
are
not
so
wild
and
handsome
,
but
they
seem
happy
,
confiding
*NL*
little
things
.
I
used
to
call
them
my
birds
,
last
summer
;
and
mother
*NL*
said
they
reminded
her
of
me
,
--
busy
,
quaker-colored
creatures
,
always
*NL*
near
the
shore
,
and
always
chirping
that
contented
little
song
of
*NL*
theirs
.
You
are
the
gull
,
Jo
,
strong
and
wild
,
fond
of
the
storm
and
the
*NL*
wind
,
flying
far
out
to
sea
,
and
happy
all
alone
.
Meg
is
the
*NL*
turtle-dove
,
and
Amy
is
like
the
lark
she
writes
about
,
trying
to
get
up
*NL*
among
the
clouds
,
but
always
dropping
down
into
its
nest
again
.
Dear
*NL*
little
girl
!
she
's
so
ambitious
,
but
her
heart
is
good
and
tender
;
and
*NL*
no
matter
how
high
she
flies
,
she
never
will
forget
home
.
I
hope
I
shall
*NL*
see
her
again
,
but
she
seems
_
so
_
far
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
coming
in
the
spring
,
and
I
mean
that
you
shall
be
all
ready
to
*NL*
see
and
enjoy
her
.
I
'm
going
to
have
you
well
and
rosy
by
that
time
,
''
*NL*
began
Jo
,
feeling
that
of
all
the
changes
in
Beth
,
the
talking
change
*NL*
was
the
greatest
,
for
it
seemed
to
cost
no
effort
now
,
and
she
thought
*NL*
aloud
in
a
way
quite
unlike
bashful
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
dear
,
do
n't
hope
any
more
;
it
wo
n't
do
any
good
,
I
'm
sure
of
that
.
*NL*
We
wo
n't
be
miserable
,
but
enjoy
being
together
while
we
wait
.
We
'll
*NL*
have
happy
times
,
for
I
do
n't
suffer
much
,
and
I
think
the
tide
will
go
*NL*
out
easily
,
if
you
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
leaned
down
to
kiss
the
tranquil
face
;
and
with
that
silent
kiss
,
she
*NL*
dedicated
herself
soul
and
body
to
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
right
:
there
was
no
need
of
any
words
when
they
got
home
,
for
*NL*
father
and
mother
saw
plainly
,
now
,
what
they
had
prayed
to
be
saved
*NL*
from
seeing
.
Tired
with
her
short
journey
,
Beth
went
at
once
to
bed
,
*NL*
saying
how
glad
she
was
to
be
at
home
;
and
when
Jo
went
down
,
she
found
*NL*
that
she
would
be
spared
the
hard
task
of
telling
Beth
's
secret
.
Her
*NL*
father
stood
leaning
his
head
on
the
mantelpiece
,
and
did
not
turn
as
*NL*
she
came
in
;
but
her
mother
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
for
help
,
and
*NL*
Jo
went
to
comfort
her
without
a
word
.

NEW
IMPRESSIONS
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
three
o'clock
in
the
afternoon
,
all
the
fashionable
world
at
Nice
may
*NL*
be
seen
on
the
Promenade
des
Anglais
,
--
a
charming
place
;
for
the
wide
*NL*
walk
,
bordered
with
palms
,
flowers
,
and
tropical
shrubs
,
is
bounded
on
*NL*
one
side
by
the
sea
,
on
the
other
by
the
grand
drive
,
lined
with
hotels
*NL*
and
villas
,
while
beyond
lie
orange-orchards
and
the
hills
.
Many
nations
*NL*
are
represented
,
many
languages
spoken
,
many
costumes
worn
;
and
,
on
a
*NL*
sunny
day
,
the
spectacle
is
as
gay
and
brilliant
as
a
carnival
.
Haughty
*NL*
English
,
lively
French
,
sober
Germans
,
handsome
Spaniards
,
ugly
*NL*
Russians
,
meek
Jews
,
free-and-easy
Americans
,
all
drive
,
sit
,
or
saunter
*NL*
here
,
chatting
over
the
news
,
and
criticising
the
latest
celebrity
who
*NL*
has
arrived
,
--
Ristori
or
Dickens
,
Victor
Emmanuel
or
the
Queen
of
the
*NL*
Sandwich
Islands
.
The
equipages
are
as
varied
as
the
company
,
and
*NL*
attract
as
much
attention
,
especially
the
low
basket-barouches
in
which
*NL*
ladies
drive
themselves
,
with
a
pair
of
dashing
ponies
,
gay
nets
to
keep
*NL*
their
voluminous
flounces
from
overflowing
the
diminutive
vehicles
,
and
*NL*
little
grooms
on
the
perch
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
this
walk
,
on
Christmas
Day
,
a
tall
young
man
walked
slowly
,
with
*NL*
his
hands
behind
him
,
and
a
somewhat
absent
expression
of
countenance
.
*NL*
He
looked
like
an
Italian
,
was
dressed
like
an
Englishman
,
and
had
the
*NL*
independent
air
of
an
American
,
--
a
combination
which
caused
sundry
pairs
*NL*
of
feminine
eyes
to
look
approvingly
after
him
,
and
sundry
dandies
in
*NL*
black
velvet
suits
,
with
rose-colored
neckties
,
buff
gloves
,
and
*NL*
orange-flowers
in
their
button-holes
,
to
shrug
their
shoulders
,
and
then
*NL*
envy
him
his
inches
.
There
were
plenty
of
pretty
faces
to
admire
,
but
*NL*
the
young
man
took
little
notice
of
them
,
except
to
glance
,
now
and
*NL*
then
,
at
some
blonde
girl
,
or
lady
in
blue
.
Presently
he
strolled
out
of
*NL*
the
promenade
,
and
stood
a
moment
at
the
crossing
,
as
if
undecided
*NL*
whether
to
go
and
listen
to
the
band
in
the
Jardin
Publique
,
or
to
*NL*
wander
along
the
beach
toward
Castle
Hill
.
The
quick
trot
of
ponies
'
*NL*
feet
made
him
look
up
,
as
one
of
the
little
carriages
,
containing
a
*NL*
single
lady
,
came
rapidly
down
the
street
.
The
lady
was
young
,
blonde
,
*NL*
and
dressed
in
blue
.
He
stared
a
minute
,
then
his
whole
face
woke
up
,
*NL*
and
,
waving
his
hat
like
a
boy
,
he
hurried
forward
to
meet
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Laurie
,
is
it
really
you
?
I
thought
you
'd
never
come
!
''
cried
Amy
,
*NL*
dropping
the
reins
,
and
holding
out
both
hands
,
to
the
great
*NL*
scandalization
of
a
French
mamma
,
who
hastened
her
daughter
's
steps
,
*NL*
lest
she
should
be
demoralized
by
beholding
the
free
manners
of
these
*NL*
``
mad
English
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
detained
by
the
way
,
but
I
promised
to
spend
Christmas
with
you

*NL*
and
here
I
am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
your

When
did
you
come
?
Where
are
you
staying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
--
last
night
--
at
the
Chauvain
.
I
called
at
your
hotel
,
but
you

were
all
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
so
much
to

I
do
n't
know
where
to
begin
!
Get
in
,
and
we
can
*NL*
talk
at
our
ease

I
was
going

a
drive

longing

company

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
happens
then

ball

*NL*
*NL*
``
A
Christmas
party
at
our
hotel

There
are
many
Americans
there
,
and
*NL*
they
give
it
in
honor
of
the
day

You
'll
go
with

of

?
Aunt
*NL*
will
be
charmed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
Where
now
?
''
asked
Laurie
,
leaning
back
and
folding
his
arms
,
*NL*
a
proceeding
which
suited
Amy
,
who
preferred
to
drive
;
for
her
*NL*
parasol-whip
and
blue
reins
over
the
white
ponies
'
backs
,
afforded
her
*NL*
infinite
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
the
banker
's
first
,
for
letters
,
and
then
to
Castle
Hill
;
*NL*
the
view
is
so
lovely
,
and
I
like
to
feed
the
peacocks
.
Have
you
ever
*NL*
been
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Often
,
years
ago
;
but
I
do
n't
mind
having
a
look
at
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
tell
me
all
about
yourself

The
last
I
heard
of
you

your
*NL*
grandfather
wrote
that
he
expected
you
from
Berlin

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
spent
a
month
there

and
then
joined
him
in
Paris

where
he
has
*NL*
settled
for
the
winter
.
He
has
friends
there
,
and
finds
plenty
to
amuse
*NL*
him
;
so
I
go
and
come
,
and
we
get
on
capitally
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
sociable
arrangement

''
said
Amy
,
missing
something
in
Laurie
's
*NL*
manner
,
though
she
could
n't
tell
what
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
see
he
hates
to
travel
,
and
I
hate
to
keep
still
;
so
we
each
*NL*
suit
ourselves
,
and
there
is
no
trouble
.
I
am
often
with
him
,
and
he
*NL*
enjoys
my
adventures
,
while
I
like
to
feel
that
some
one
is
glad
to
see
*NL*
me
when
I
get
back
from
my
wanderings
.
Dirty
old
hole
,
is
n't
it
?
''
he
*NL*
added
,
with
a
look
of
disgust
,
as
they
drove
along
the
boulevard
to
the
*NL*
Place
Napoleon
,
in
the
old
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
dirt
is
picturesque
,
so
I
do
n't
mind
.
The
river
and
the
hills
are
*NL*
delicious
,
and
these
glimpses
of
the
narrow
cross-streets
are
my
*NL*
delight
.
Now
we
shall
have
to
wait
for
that
procession
to
pass
;
it
's
*NL*
going
to
the
Church
of
St.
John
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Laurie
listlessly
watched
the
procession
of
priests
under
their
*NL*
canopies
,
white-veiled
nuns
bearing
lighted
tapers
,
and
some
brotherhood
*NL*
in
blue
,
chanting
as
they
walked
,
Amy
watched
him
,
and
felt
a
new
sort
*NL*
of
shyness
steal
over
her
;
for
he
was
changed
,
and
she
could
not
find
*NL*
the
merry-faced
boy
she
left
in
the
moody-looking
man
beside
her
.
He
was
*NL*
handsomer
than
ever
,
and
greatly
improved
,
she
thought
;
but
now
that
the
*NL*
flush
of
pleasure
at
meeting
her
was
over
,
he
looked
tired
and
*NL*
spiritless
,
--
not
sick
,
nor
exactly
unhappy
,
but
older
and
graver
than
a
*NL*
year
or
two
of
prosperous
life
should
have
made
him
.
She
could
n't
*NL*
understand
it
,
and
did
not
venture
to
ask
questions
;
so
she
shook
her
*NL*
head
,
and
touched
up
her
ponies
,
as
the
procession
wound
away
across
the
*NL*
arches
of
the
Paglioni
bridge
,
and
vanished
in
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Que
pensez
vous
_
?
''
she
said
,
airing
her
French
,
which
had
improved
in
*NL*
quantity
,
if
not
in
quality
,
since
she
came
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
mademoiselle
has
made
good
use
of
her
time
,
and
the
result
is
*NL*
charming

''
replied
Laurie
,
bowing
,
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
,
and
an
*NL*
admiring
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
blushed
with
pleasure
,
but
somehow
the
compliment
did
not
satisfy
*NL*
her
like
the
blunt
praises
he
used
to
give
her
at
home
,
when
he
*NL*
promenaded
round
her
on
festival
occasions
,
and
told
her
she
was
*NL*
``
altogether
jolly
,
''
with
a
hearty
smile
and
an
approving
pat
on
the
*NL*
head
.
She
did
n't
like
the
new
tone
;
for
,
though
not
_
blase
_
,
it
sounded
*NL*
indifferent
in
spite
of
the
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
's
the
way
he
's
going
to
grow
up
,
I
wish
he
'd
stay
a
boy
,
''
she
*NL*
thought
,
with
a
curious
sense
of
disappointment
and
discomfort
,
trying
*NL*
meantime
to
seem
quite
easy
and
gay
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Avigdor
's
she
found
the
precious
home-letters
,
and
,
giving
the
reins
*NL*
to
Laurie
,
read
them
luxuriously
as
they
wound
up
the
shady
road
between
*NL*
green
hedges
,
where
tea-roses
bloomed
as
freshly
as
in
June
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beth
is
very
poorly
,
mother
says
.
I
often
think
I
ought
to
go
home
,
but
*NL*
they
all
say
`
stay
;
'
so
I
do
,
for
I
shall
never
have
another
chance
like
*NL*
this
,
''
said
Amy
,
looking
sober
over
one
page
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
right
,
there
;
you
could
do
nothing
at
home
,
and
it
is
a
*NL*
great
comfort
to
them
to
know
that
you
are
well
and
happy
,
and
enjoying
*NL*
so
much
,
my
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
a
little
nearer
,
and
looked
more
like
his
old
self
,
as
he
said
*NL*
that
;
and
the
fear
that
sometimes
weighed
on
Amy
's
heart
was
lightened
,
*NL*
for
the
look
,
the
act
,
the
brotherly
``
my
dear
,
''
seemed
to
assure
her
*NL*
that
if
any
trouble
did
come
,
she
would
not
be
alone
in
a
strange
land
.
*NL*
Presently
she
laughed
,
and
showed
him
a
small
sketch
of
Jo
in
her
*NL*
scribbling-suit
,
with
the
bow
rampantly
erect
upon
her
cap
,
and
issuing
*NL*
from
her
mouth
the
words
,
``
Genius
burns
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
smiled
,
took
it
,
put
it
in
his
vest-pocket
,
``
to
keep
it
from
*NL*
blowing
away
,
''
and
listened
with
interest
to
the
lively
letter
Amy
read
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
be
a
regularly
merry
Christmas
to
me
,
with
presents
in
the
*NL*
morning
,
you
and
letters
in
the
afternoon
,
and
a
party
at
night
,
''
said
*NL*
Amy
,
as
they
alighted
among
the
ruins
of
the
old
fort
,
and
a
flock
of
*NL*
splendid
peacocks
came
trooping
about
them
,
tamely
waiting
to
be
fed
.
*NL*
While
Amy
stood
laughing
on
the
bank
above
him
as
she
scattered
crumbs
*NL*
to
the
brilliant
birds
,
Laurie
looked
at
her
as
she
had
looked
at
him
,
*NL*
with
a
natural
curiosity
to
see
what
changes
time
and
absence
had
*NL*
wrought
.
He
found
nothing
to
perplex
or
disappoint
,
much
to
admire
and
*NL*
approve
;
for
,
overlooking
a
few
little
affectations
of
speech
and
*NL*
manner
,
she
was
as
sprightly
and
graceful
as
ever
,
with
the
addition
of
*NL*
that
indescribable
something
in
dress
and
bearing
which
we
call
*NL*
elegance
.
Always
mature
for
her
age
,
she
had
gained
a
certain
_
aplomb
_
*NL*
in
both
carriage
and
conversation
,
which
made
her
seem
more
of
a
woman
*NL*
of
the
world
than
she
was
;
but
her
old
petulance
now
and
then
showed
*NL*
itself
,
her
strong
will
still
held
its
own
,
and
her
native
frankness
was
*NL*
unspoiled
by
foreign
polish
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
did
not
read
all
this
while
he
watched
her
feed
the
peacocks
,
but
*NL*
he
saw
enough
to
satisfy
and
interest
him
,
and
carried
away
a
pretty
*NL*
little
picture
of
a
bright-faced
girl
standing
in
the
sunshine
,
which
*NL*
brought
out
the
soft
hue
of
her
dress
,
the
fresh
color
of
her
cheeks
,
*NL*
the
golden
gloss
of
her
hair
,
and
made
her
a
prominent
figure
in
the
*NL*
pleasant
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
came
up
on
to
the
stone
plateau
that
crowns
the
hill
,
Amy
waved
*NL*
her
hand
as
if
welcoming
him
to
her
favorite
haunt
,
and
said
,
pointing
*NL*
here
and
there
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
the
Cathedral
and
the
Corso
,
the
fishermen
dragging
*NL*
their
nets
in
the
bay
,
and
the
lovely
road
to
Villa
Franca
,
Schubert
's
*NL*
Tower
,
just
below
,
and
,
best
of
all
,
that
speck
far
out
to
sea
which
*NL*
they
say
is
Corsica
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
remember
;
it
's
not
much
changed
,
''
he
answered
,
without
enthusiasm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
Jo
would
give
for
a
sight
of
that
famous
speck
!
''
said
Amy
,
feeling
*NL*
in
good
spirits
,
and
anxious
to
see
him
so
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
was
all
he
said
,
but
he
turned
and
strained
his
eyes
to
see
the
*NL*
island
which
a
greater
usurper
than
even
Napoleon
now
made
interesting
*NL*
in
his
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
a
good
look
at
it
for
her
sake
,
and
then
come
and
tell
me
what
you
*NL*
have
been
doing
with
yourself
all
this
while
,
''
said
Amy
,
seating
*NL*
herself
,
ready
for
a
good
talk
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
not
get
it
;
for
,
though
he
joined
her
,
and
answered
all
her
*NL*
questions
freely
,
she
could
only
learn
that
he
had
roved
about
the
*NL*
continent
and
been
to
Greece
.
So
,
after
idling
away
an
hour
,
they
drove
*NL*
home
again
;
and
,
having
paid
his
respects
to
Mrs.
Carrol
,
Laurie
left
*NL*
them
,
promising
to
return
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
be
recorded
of
Amy
that
she
deliberately
``
prinked
''
that
night
.
*NL*
Time
and
absence
had
done
its
work
on
both
the
young
people
;
she
had
*NL*
seen
her
old
friend
in
a
new
light
,
not
as
``
our
boy
,
''
but
as
a
handsome
*NL*
and
agreeable
man
,
and
she
was
conscious
of
a
very
natural
desire
to
*NL*
find
favor
in
his
sight
.
Amy
knew
her
good
points
,
and
made
the
most
of
*NL*
them
,
with
the
taste
and
skill
which
is
a
fortune
to
a
poor
and
pretty
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tarlatan
and
tulle
were
cheap
at
Nice
,
so
she
enveloped
herself
in
them
*NL*
on
such
occasions
,
and
,
following
the
sensible
English
fashion
of
simple
*NL*
dress
for
young
girls
,
got
up
charming
little
toilettes
with
fresh
*NL*
flowers
,
a
few
trinkets
,
and
all
manner
of
dainty
devices
,
which
were
*NL*
both
inexpensive
and
effective
.
It
must
be
confessed
that
the
artist
*NL*
sometimes
got
possession
of
the
woman
,
and
indulged
in
antique
*NL*
_
coiffures
_
,
statuesque
attitudes
,
and
classic
draperies
.
But
,
dear
*NL*
heart
,
we
all
have
our
little
weaknesses
,
and
find
it
easy
to
pardon
*NL*
such
in
the
young
,
who
satisfy
our
eyes
with
their
comeliness
,
and
keep
*NL*
our
hearts
merry
with
their
artless
vanities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
want
him
to
think
I
look
well
,
and
tell
them
so
at
home
,
''
said
Amy
*NL*
to
herself
,
as
she
put
on
Flo
's
old
white
silk
ball-dress
,
and
covered
*NL*
it
with
a
cloud
of
fresh
illusion
,
out
of
which
her
white
shoulders
and
*NL*
golden
head
emerged
with
a
most
artistic
effect
.
Her
hair
she
had
the
*NL*
sense
to
let
alone
,
after
gathering
up
the
thick
waves
and
curls
into
a
*NL*
Hebe-like
knot
at
the
back
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
the
fashion
,
but
it
's
becoming
,
and
I
ca
n't
afford
to
make
a
*NL*
fright
of
myself
,
''
she
used
to
say
,
when
advised
to
frizzle
,
puff
,
or
*NL*
braid
,
as
the
latest
style
commanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
no
ornaments
fine
enough
for
this
important
occasion
,
Amy
looped
*NL*
her
fleecy
skirts
with
rosy
clusters
of
azalea
,
and
framed
the
white
*NL*
shoulders
in
delicate
green
vines
.
Remembering
the
painted
boots
,
she
*NL*
surveyed
her
white
satin
slippers
with
girlish
satisfaction
,
and
*NL*
_
chasseed
_
down
the
room
,
admiring
her
aristocratic
feet
all
by
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
new
fan
just
matches
my
flowers
,
my
gloves
fit
to
a
charm
,
and
the
*NL*
real
lace
on
aunt
's
_
mouchoir
_
gives
an
air
to
my
whole
dress
.
If
I
only
*NL*
had
a
classical
nose
and
mouth
I
should
be
perfectly
happy
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
surveying
herself
with
a
critical
eye
,
and
a
candle
in
each
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
this
affliction
,
she
looked
unusually
gay
and
graceful
as
*NL*
she
glided
away
;
she
seldom
ran
,
--
it
did
not
suit
her
style
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
for
,
being
tall
,
the
stately
and
Junoesque
was
more
appropriate
*NL*
than
the
sportive
or
piquante
.
She
walked
up
and
down
the
long
saloon
*NL*
while
waiting
for
Laurie
,
and
once
arranged
herself
under
the
*NL*
chandelier
,
which
had
a
good
effect
upon
her
hair
;
then
she
thought
*NL*
better
of
it
,
and
went
away
to
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
as
if
ashamed
*NL*
of
the
girlish
desire
to
have
the
first
view
a
propitious
one
.
It
so
*NL*
happened
that
she
could
not
have
done
a
better
thing
,
for
Laurie
came
in
*NL*
so
quietly
she
did
not
hear
him
;
and
,
as
she
stood
at
the
distant
*NL*
window
,
with
her
head
half
turned
,
and
one
hand
gathering
up
her
dress
,
*NL*
the
slender
,
white
figure
against
the
red
curtains
was
as
effective
as
a
*NL*
well-placed
statue
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Diana
!
''
said
Laurie
,
with
the
look
of
satisfaction
she
*NL*
liked
to
see
in
his
eyes
when
they
rested
on
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
evening
,
Apollo
!
''
she
answered
,
smiling
back
at
him
,
for
he
,
too
,
*NL*
looked
unusually
_
debonnaire
_
,
and
the
thought
of
entering
the
ball-room
*NL*
on
the
arm
of
such
a
personable
man
caused
Amy
to
pity
the
four
plain
*NL*
Misses
Davis
from
the
bottom
of
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
your
flowers
;
I
arranged
them
myself
,
remembering
that
you
*NL*
did
n't
like
what
Hannah
calls
a
`
sot-bookay
,
'
''
said
Laurie
,
handing
her
*NL*
a
delicate
nosegay
,
in
a
holder
that
she
had
long
coveted
as
she
daily
*NL*
passed
it
in
Cardiglia
's
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Illustration

Here
are
your
flowers
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
kind
you
are
!
''
she
exclaimed
gratefully
.
``
If
I
'd
known
you
were
*NL*
coming
I
'd
have
had
something
ready
for
you
to-day
,
though
not
as
pretty
*NL*
as
this
,
I
'm
afraid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
it
is
n't
what
it
should
be
,
but
you
have
improved
it
,
''
he
*NL*
added
,
as
she
snapped
the
silver
bracelet
on
her
wrist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
do
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
liked
that
sort
of
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
from
you
;
it
does
n't
sound
natural
,
and
I
like
your
old
bluntness
*NL*
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
it
,
''
he
answered
,
with
a
look
of
relief
;
then
buttoned
her
*NL*
gloves
for
her
,
and
asked
if
his
tie
was
straight
,
just
as
he
used
to
do
*NL*
when
they
went
to
parties
together
,
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
assembled
in
the
long
_
salle
a
manger
_
,
that
evening
,
was
*NL*
such
as
one
sees
nowhere
but
on
the
Continent
.
The
hospitable
Americans
*NL*
had
invited
every
acquaintance
they
had
in
Nice
,
and
,
having
no
*NL*
prejudice
against
titles
,
secured
a
few
to
add
lustre
to
their
Christmas
*NL*
ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Russian
prince
condescended
to
sit
in
a
corner
for
an
hour
,
and
talk
*NL*
with
a
massive
lady
,
dressed
like
Hamlet
's
mother
,
in
black
velvet
,
with
*NL*
a
pearl
bridle
under
her
chin
.
A
Polish
count
,
aged
eighteen
,
devoted
*NL*
himself
to
the
ladies
,
who
pronounced
him
``
a
fascinating
dear
,
''
and
a
*NL*
German
Serene
Something
,
having
come
for
the
supper
alone
,
roamed
*NL*
vaguely
about
,
seeking
what
he
might
devour
.
Baron
Rothschild
's
private
*NL*
secretary
,
a
large-nosed
Jew
,
in
tight
boots
,
affably
beamed
upon
the
*NL*
world
,
as
if
his
master
's
name
crowned
him
with
a
golden
halo
;
a
stout
*NL*
Frenchman
,
who
knew
the
Emperor
,
came
to
indulge
his
mania
for
dancing
,
*NL*
and
Lady
de
Jones
,
a
British
matron
,
adorned
the
scene
with
her
little
*NL*
family
of
eight
.
Of
course
,
there
were
many
light-footed
,
shrill-voiced
*NL*
American
girls
,
handsome
,
lifeless-looking
English
ditto
,
and
a
few
*NL*
plain
but
piquante
French
demoiselles
;
likewise
the
usual
set
of
*NL*
travelling
young
gentlemen
,
who
disported
themselves
gayly
,
while
mammas
*NL*
of
all
nations
lined
the
walls
,
and
smiled
upon
them
benignly
when
they
*NL*
danced
with
their
daughters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Any
young
girl
can
imagine
Amy
's
state
of
mind
when
she
``
took
the
stage
''
*NL*
that
night
,
leaning
on
Laurie
's
arm
.
She
knew
she
looked
well
,
she
loved
*NL*
to
dance
,
she
felt
that
her
foot
was
on
her
native
heath
in
a
ball-room
,
*NL*
and
enjoyed
the
delightful
sense
of
power
which
comes
when
young
girls
*NL*
first
discover
the
new
and
lovely
kingdom
they
are
born
to
rule
by
*NL*
virtue
of
beauty
,
youth
,
and
womanhood
.
She
did
pity
the
Davis
girls
,
*NL*
who
were
awkward
,
plain
,
and
destitute
of
escort
,
except
a
grim
papa
and
*NL*
three
grimmer
maiden
aunts
,
and
she
bowed
to
them
in
her
friendliest
*NL*
manner
as
she
passed
;
which
was
good
of
her
,
as
it
permitted
them
to
see
*NL*
her
dress
,
and
burn
with
curiosity
to
know
who
her
distinguished-looking
*NL*
friend
might
be
.
With
the
first
burst
of
the
band
,
Amy
's
color
rose
,
her
*NL*
eyes
began
to
sparkle
,
and
her
feet
to
tap
the
floor
impatiently
;
for
*NL*
she
danced
well
,
and
wanted
Laurie
to
know
it
:
therefore
the
shock
she
*NL*
received
can
better
be
imagined
than
described
,
when
he
said
,
in
a
*NL*
perfectly
tranquil
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
care
to
dance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
usually
does
at
a
ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
amazed
look
and
quick
answer
caused
Laurie
to
repair
his
error
as
*NL*
fast
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
meant
the
first
dance
.
May
I
have
the
honor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
give
you
one
if
I
put
off
the
Count
.
He
dances
divinely
;
but
he
*NL*
will
excuse
me
,
as
you
are
an
old
friend
,
''
said
Amy
,
hoping
that
the
*NL*
name
would
have
a
good
effect
,
and
show
Laurie
that
she
was
not
to
be
*NL*
trifled
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice
little
boy
,
but
rather
a
short
Pole
to
support
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
A
daughter
of
the
gods
,
*NL*
Divinely
tall
,
and
most
divinely
fair
,
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
was
all
the
satisfaction
she
got
,
however
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
set
in
which
they
found
themselves
was
composed
of
English
,
and
Amy
*NL*
was
compelled
to
walk
decorously
through
a
cotillon
,
feeling
all
the
*NL*
while
as
if
she
could
dance
the
Tarantula
with
a
relish
.
Laurie
resigned
*NL*
her
to
the
``
nice
little
boy
,
''
and
went
to
do
his
duty
to
Flo
,
without
*NL*
securing
Amy
for
the
joys
to
come
,
which
reprehensible
want
of
*NL*
forethought
was
properly
punished
,
for
she
immediately
engaged
herself
*NL*
till
supper
,
meaning
to
relent
if
he
then
gave
any
signs
of
penitence
.
*NL*
She
showed
him
her
ball-book
with
demure
satisfaction
when
he
strolled
,
*NL*
instead
of
rushing
,
up
to
claim
her
for
the
next
,
a
glorious
*NL*
polka-redowa
;
but
his
polite
regrets
did
n't
impose
upon
her
,
and
when
*NL*
she
gallopaded
away
with
the
Count
,
she
saw
Laurie
sit
down
by
her
aunt
*NL*
with
an
actual
expression
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
unpardonable
;
and
Amy
took
no
more
notice
of
him
for
a
long
*NL*
while
,
except
a
word
now
and
then
,
when
she
came
to
her
chaperon
,
*NL*
between
the
dances
,
for
a
necessary
pin
or
a
moment
's
rest
.
Her
anger
*NL*
had
a
good
effect
,
however
,
for
she
hid
it
under
a
smiling
face
,
and
*NL*
seemed
unusually
blithe
and
brilliant
.
Laurie
's
eyes
followed
her
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
for
she
neither
romped
nor
sauntered
,
but
danced
with
spirit
*NL*
and
grace
,
making
the
delightsome
pastime
what
it
should
be
.
He
very
*NL*
naturally
fell
to
studying
her
from
this
new
point
of
view
;
and
,
before
*NL*
the
evening
was
half
over
,
had
decided
that
``
little
Amy
was
going
to
*NL*
make
a
very
charming
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lively
scene
,
for
soon
the
spirit
of
the
social
season
took
*NL*
possession
of
every
one
,
and
Christmas
merriment
made
all
faces
shine
,
*NL*
hearts
happy
,
and
heels
light
.
The
musicians
fiddled
,
tooted
,
and
banged
*NL*
as
if
they
enjoyed
it
;
everybody
danced
who
could
,
and
those
who
*NL*
could
n't
admired
their
neighbors
with
uncommon
warmth
.
The
air
was
dark
*NL*
with
Davises
,
and
many
Joneses
gambolled
like
a
flock
of
young
giraffes
.
*NL*
The
golden
secretary
darted
through
the
room
like
a
meteor
,
with
a
*NL*
dashing
Frenchwoman
,
who
carpeted
the
floor
with
her
pink
satin
train
.
*NL*
The
Serene
Teuton
found
the
supper-table
,
and
was
happy
,
eating
steadily
*NL*
through
the
bill
of
fare
,
and
dismayed
the
_
garcons
_
by
the
ravages
he
*NL*
committed
.
But
the
Emperor
's
friend
covered
himself
with
glory
,
for
he
*NL*
danced
everything
,
whether
he
knew
it
or
not
,
and
introduced
impromptu
*NL*
pirouettes
when
the
figures
bewildered
him
.
The
boyish
abandon
of
that
*NL*
stout
man
was
charming
to
behold
;
for
,
though
he
``
carried
weight
,
''
he
*NL*
danced
like
an
india-rubber
ball
.
He
ran
,
he
flew
,
he
pranced
;
his
face
*NL*
glowed
,
his
bald
head
shone
;
his
coat-tails
waved
wildly
,
his
pumps
*NL*
actually
twinkled
in
the
air
,
and
when
the
music
stopped
,
he
wiped
the
*NL*
drops
from
his
brow
,
and
beamed
upon
his
fellow-men
like
a
French
*NL*
Pickwick
without
glasses
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
and
her
Pole
distinguished
themselves
by
equal
enthusiasm
,
but
more
*NL*
graceful
agility
;
and
Laurie
found
himself
involuntarily
keeping
time
to
*NL*
the
rhythmic
rise
and
fall
of
the
white
slippers
as
they
flew
by
as
*NL*
indefatigably
as
if
winged
.
When
little
Vladimir
finally
relinquished
*NL*
her
,
with
assurances
that
he
was
``
desolated
to
leave
so
early
,
''
she
was
*NL*
ready
to
rest
,
and
see
how
her
recreant
knight
had
borne
his
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
successful
;
for
,
at
three-and-twenty
,
blighted
affections
*NL*
find
a
balm
in
friendly
society
,
and
young
nerves
will
thrill
,
young
*NL*
blood
dance
,
and
healthy
young
spirits
rise
,
when
subjected
to
the
*NL*
enchantment
of
beauty
,
light
,
music
,
and
motion
.
Laurie
had
a
waked-up
*NL*
look
as
he
rose
to
give
her
his
seat
;
and
when
he
hurried
away
to
bring
*NL*
her
some
supper
,
she
said
to
herself
,
with
a
satisfied
smile
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
I
thought
that
would
do
him
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
like
Balzac
's
`
Femme
peinte
par
elle-meme
,
'
''
he
said
,
as
he
*NL*
fanned
her
with
one
hand
,
and
held
her
coffee-cup
in
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
rouge
wo
n't
come
off
;
''
and
Amy
rubbed
her
brilliant
cheek
,
and
*NL*
showed
him
her
white
glove
with
a
sober
simplicity
that
made
him
laugh
*NL*
outright
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
call
this
stuff
?
''
he
asked
,
touching
a
fold
of
her
dress
*NL*
that
had
blown
over
his
knee
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Illusion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
name
for
it
;
it
's
very
pretty
--
new
thing
,
is
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
as
old
as
the
hills
;
you
have
seen
it
on
dozens
of
girls
,
and
you
*NL*
never
found
out
that
it
was
pretty
till
now
--
_
stupide
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
saw
it
on
you
before
,
which
accounts
for
the
mistake
,
you
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
of
that
,
it
is
forbidden
;
I
'd
rather
take
coffee
than
compliments
*NL*
just
now
.
No
,
do
n't
lounge
,
it
makes
me
nervous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
sat
bolt
upright
,
and
meekly
took
her
empty
plate
,
feeling
an
odd
*NL*
sort
of
pleasure
in
having
``
little
Amy
''
order
him
about
;
for
she
had
*NL*
lost
her
shyness
now
,
and
felt
an
irresistible
desire
to
trample
on
him
,
*NL*
as
girls
have
a
delightful
way
of
doing
when
lords
of
creation
show
any
*NL*
signs
of
subjection
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
learn
all
this
sort
of
thing
?
''
he
asked
,
with
a
quizzical
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
`
this
sort
of
thing
'
is
rather
a
vague
expression
,
would
you
kindly
*NL*
explain
?
''
returned
Amy
,
knowing
perfectly
well
what
he
meant
,
but
*NL*
wickedly
leaving
him
to
describe
what
is
indescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
the
general
air
,
the
style
,
the
self-possession
,
*NL*
the
--
the
--
illusion
--
you
know
,
''
laughed
Laurie
,
breaking
down
,
and
*NL*
helping
himself
out
of
his
quandary
with
the
new
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
was
gratified
,
but
,
of
course
,
did
n't
show
it
,
and
demurely
*NL*
answered
,
``
Foreign
life
polishes
one
in
spite
of
one
's
self
;
I
study
as
*NL*
well
as
play
;
and
as
for
this
''
--
with
a
little
gesture
toward
her
*NL*
dress
--
``
why
,
tulle
is
cheap
,
posies
to
be
had
for
nothing
,
and
I
am
used
*NL*
to
making
the
most
of
my
poor
little
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
rather
regretted
that
last
sentence
,
fearing
it
was
n't
in
good
*NL*
taste
;
but
Laurie
liked
her
the
better
for
it
,
and
found
himself
both
*NL*
admiring
and
respecting
the
brave
patience
that
made
the
most
of
*NL*
opportunity
,
and
the
cheerful
spirit
that
covered
poverty
with
flowers
.
*NL*
Amy
did
not
know
why
he
looked
at
her
so
kindly
,
nor
why
he
filled
up
*NL*
her
book
with
his
own
name
,
and
devoted
himself
to
her
for
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
evening
,
in
the
most
delightful
manner
;
but
the
impulse
that
wrought
*NL*
this
agreeable
change
was
the
result
of
one
of
the
new
impressions
which
*NL*
both
of
them
were
unconsciously
giving
and
receiving
.

ON
THE
SHELF
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
France
the
young
girls
have
a
dull
time
of
it
till
they
are
married
,
*NL*
when
''
_
Vive
la
liberte
_
''
becomes
their
motto
.
In
America
,
as
every
one
*NL*
knows
,
girls
early
sign
the
declaration
of
independence
,
and
enjoy
their
*NL*
freedom
with
republican
zest
;
but
the
young
matrons
usually
abdicate
*NL*
with
the
first
heir
to
the
throne
,
and
go
into
a
seclusion
almost
as
*NL*
close
as
a
French
nunnery
,
though
by
no
means
as
quiet
.
Whether
they
*NL*
like
it
or
not
,
they
are
virtually
put
upon
the
shelf
as
soon
as
the
*NL*
wedding
excitement
is
over
,
and
most
of
them
might
exclaim
,
as
did
a
*NL*
very
pretty
woman
the
other
day
,
``
I
'm
as
handsome
as
ever
,
but
no
one
*NL*
takes
any
notice
of
me
because
I
'm
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
being
a
belle
or
even
a
fashionable
lady
,
Meg
did
not
experience
*NL*
this
affliction
till
her
babies
were
a
year
old
,
for
in
her
little
world
*NL*
primitive
customs
prevailed
,
and
she
found
herself
more
admired
and
*NL*
beloved
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
was
a
womanly
little
woman
,
the
maternal
instinct
was
very
*NL*
strong
,
and
she
was
entirely
absorbed
in
her
children
,
to
the
utter
*NL*
exclusion
of
everything
and
everybody
else
.
Day
and
night
she
brooded
*NL*
over
them
with
tireless
devotion
and
anxiety
,
leaving
John
to
the
tender
*NL*
mercies
of
the
help
,
for
an
Irish
lady
now
presided
over
the
kitchen
*NL*
department
.
Being
a
domestic
man
,
John
decidedly
missed
the
wifely
*NL*
attentions
he
had
been
accustomed
to
receive
;
but
,
as
he
adored
his
*NL*
babies
,
he
cheerfully
relinquished
his
comfort
for
a
time
,
supposing
,
*NL*
with
masculine
ignorance
,
that
peace
would
soon
be
restored
.
But
three
*NL*
months
passed
,
and
there
was
no
return
of
repose
;
Meg
looked
worn
and
*NL*
nervous
,
the
babies
absorbed
every
minute
of
her
time
,
the
house
was
*NL*
neglected
,
and
Kitty
,
the
cook
,
who
took
life
``
aisy
,
''
kept
him
on
short
*NL*
commons
.
When
he
went
out
in
the
morning
he
was
bewildered
by
small
*NL*
commissions
for
the
captive
mamma
;
if
he
came
gayly
in
at
night
,
eager
*NL*
to
embrace
his
family
,
he
was
quenched
by
a
``
Hush
!
they
are
just
asleep
*NL*
after
worrying
all
day
.
''
If
he
proposed
a
little
amusement
at
home
,
``
No
,
*NL*
it
would
disturb
the
babies
.
''
If
he
hinted
at
a
lecture
or
concert
,
he
*NL*
was
answered
with
a
reproachful
look
,
and
a
decided
``
Leave
my
children
*NL*
for
pleasure
,
never
!
''
His
sleep
was
broken
by
infant
wails
and
visions
*NL*
of
a
phantom
figure
pacing
noiselessly
to
and
fro
in
the
watches
of
the
*NL*
night
;
his
meals
were
interrupted
by
the
frequent
flight
of
the
*NL*
presiding
genius
,
who
deserted
him
,
half-helped
,
if
a
muffled
chirp
*NL*
sounded
from
the
nest
above
;
and
when
he
read
his
paper
of
an
evening
,
*NL*
Demi
's
colic
got
into
the
shipping-list
,
and
Daisy
's
fall
affected
the
*NL*
price
of
stocks
,
for
Mrs.
Brooke
was
only
interested
in
domestic
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
man
was
very
uncomfortable
,
for
the
children
had
bereft
him
of
*NL*
his
wife
;
home
was
merely
a
nursery
,
and
the
perpetual
``
hushing
''
made
*NL*
him
feel
like
a
brutal
intruder
whenever
he
entered
the
sacred
precincts
*NL*
of
Babyland
.
He
bore
it
very
patiently
for
six
months
,
and
,
when
no
*NL*
signs
of
amendment
appeared
,
he
did
what
other
paternal
exiles
*NL*
do
,
--
tried
to
get
a
little
comfort
elsewhere
.
Scott
had
married
and
gone
*NL*
to
housekeeping
not
far
off
,
and
John
fell
into
the
way
of
running
over
*NL*
for
an
hour
or
two
of
an
evening
,
when
his
own
parlor
was
empty
,
and
his
*NL*
own
wife
singing
lullabies
that
seemed
to
have
no
end
.
Mrs.
Scott
was
a
*NL*
lively
,
pretty
girl
,
with
nothing
to
do
but
be
agreeable
,
and
she
*NL*
performed
her
mission
most
successfully
.
The
parlor
was
always
bright
*NL*
and
attractive
,
the
chessboard
ready
,
the
piano
in
tune
,
plenty
of
gay
*NL*
gossip
,
and
a
nice
little
supper
set
forth
in
tempting
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
John
would
have
preferred
his
own
fireside
if
it
had
not
been
so
lonely
;
*NL*
but
as
it
was
,
he
gratefully
took
the
next
best
thing
,
and
enjoyed
his
*NL*
neighbor
's
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
rather
approved
of
the
new
arrangement
at
first
,
and
found
it
a
*NL*
relief
to
know
that
John
was
having
a
good
time
instead
of
dozing
in
the
*NL*
parlor
,
or
tramping
about
the
house
and
waking
the
children
.
But
by
and
*NL*
by
,
when
the
teething
worry
was
over
,
and
the
idols
went
to
sleep
at
*NL*
proper
hours
,
leaving
mamma
time
to
rest
,
she
began
to
miss
John
,
and
*NL*
find
her
work-basket
dull
company
,
when
he
was
not
sitting
opposite
in
*NL*
his
old
dressing-gown
,
comfortably
scorching
his
slippers
on
the
fender
.
*NL*
She
would
not
ask
him
to
stay
at
home
,
but
felt
injured
because
he
did
*NL*
not
know
that
she
wanted
him
without
being
told
,
entirely
forgetting
the
*NL*
many
evenings
he
had
waited
for
her
in
vain
.
She
was
nervous
and
worn
*NL*
out
with
watching
and
worry
,
and
in
that
unreasonable
frame
of
mind
*NL*
which
the
best
of
mothers
occasionally
experience
when
domestic
cares
*NL*
oppress
them
.
Want
of
exercise
robs
them
of
cheerfulness
,
and
too
much
*NL*
devotion
to
that
idol
of
American
women
,
the
teapot
,
makes
them
feel
as
*NL*
if
they
were
all
nerve
and
no
muscle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
would
say
,
looking
in
the
glass
,
``
I
'm
getting
old
and
ugly
;
*NL*
John
does
n't
find
me
interesting
any
longer
,
so
he
leaves
his
faded
wife
*NL*
and
goes
to
see
his
pretty
neighbor
,
who
has
no
incumbrances
.
Well
,
the
*NL*
babies
love
me
;
they
do
n't
care
if
I
am
thin
and
pale
,
and
have
n't
time
*NL*
to
crimp
my
hair
;
they
are
my
comfort
,
and
some
day
John
will
see
what
*NL*
I
've
gladly
sacrificed
for
them
,
wo
n't
he
,
my
precious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
which
pathetic
appeal
Daisy
would
answer
with
a
coo
,
or
Demi
with
a
*NL*
crow
,
and
Meg
would
put
by
her
lamentations
for
a
maternal
revel
,
which
*NL*
soothed
her
solitude
for
the
time
being
.
But
the
pain
increased
as
*NL*
politics
absorbed
John
,
who
was
always
running
over
to
discuss
*NL*
interesting
points
with
Scott
,
quite
unconscious
that
Meg
missed
him
.
*NL*
Not
a
word
did
she
say
,
however
,
till
her
mother
found
her
in
tears
one
*NL*
day
,
and
insisted
on
knowing
what
the
matter
was
,
for
Meg
's
drooping
*NL*
spirits
had
not
escaped
her
observation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
tell
any
one
except
you
,
mother

but
I
really
do
need

for

if
John
goes
on
so
much
longer
I
might
as
well
be
widowed

''
*NL*
replied
Mrs.
Brooke
,
drying
her
tears
on
Daisy
's
bib
,
with
an
injured
*NL*
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Goes
on
how

''
asked
her
mother
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

away

*NL*
Meg
drew
her
low
chair
beside
her
mother
's
,
and
,
with
a
little
*NL*
interruption
in
either
lap
,
the
two
women
rocked
and
talked
lovingly
*NL*
together
,
feeling
that
the
tie
of
motherhood
made
them
more
one
than
*NL*
ever

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
only
made
the

A

Meg

one
that
had
better
be
remedied

an
idea

My

it

you

Not

you
owe
something
to
John

do

feel

has
his

part
to
do
,

he
will
do
it
gladly
and
faithfully

it
will
be

better

*NL*
``
You
really

so

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it

Meg
,
for
I
've
tried
it
;
and
I
seldom
give
advice
unless
I
've
*NL*
proved
its
practicability
.
When
you
and
Jo
were
little
,
I
went
on
just
*NL*
as
you
are
,
feeling
as
if
I
did
n't
do
my
duty
unless
I
devoted
myself
*NL*
wholly
to
you
.
Poor
father
took
to
his
books
,
after
I
had
refused
all
*NL*
offers
of
help
,
and
left
me
to
try
my
experiment
alone

I
struggled
*NL*
along
as
well
as
I
could
,
but
Jo
was
too
much
for
me

I
nearly
spoilt
*NL*
her
by
indulgence

You
were
poorly
,
and
I
worried
about
you
till
I
fell
*NL*
sick
myself

Then
father
came
to
the
rescue
,
quietly
managed
everything

*NL*

made
himself
so
helpful
that
I
saw
my
mistake
,
and
never
have
been
*NL*
able
to
get
on
without
him
since
.
That
is
the
secret
of
our
home
*NL*
happiness
:
he
does
not
let
business
wean
him
from
the
little
cares
and
*NL*
duties
that
affect
us
all
,
and
I
try
not
to
let
domestic
worries
destroy
*NL*
my
interest
in
his
pursuits

our
part
alone
in
many
things

at
home
we
work
together

always

It

Demi

it

none

Then
I

do
what
I
have
often

proposed

let
Hannah
come
and
help
you

she
is
a
capital
nurse

you

may
trust

precious

need

John
would
find

Go
out
more

keep
cheerful

understand

This
is
just
the
time

Meg

when
young
married
people
are
apt
to
grow
*NL*
apart

and
the
very
time
when
they
ought

be
most

for
the

God
bless

*NL*
*NL*
Meg
did
think
it
over
,
found
it
good

and
acted
upon
it
,
though
the
*NL*
first
attempt
was
not
made
exactly
as
she
planned
to
have
it
.
Of
course
*NL*
the
children
tyrannized
over
her
,
and
ruled
the
house
as
soon
as
they
*NL*
found
out
that
kicking
and
squalling
brought
them
whatever
they
wanted
.
*NL*
Mamma
was
an
abject
slave
to
their
caprices
,
but
papa
was
not
so
easily
*NL*
subjugated
,
and
occasionally
afflicted
his
tender
spouse
by
an
attempt
*NL*
at
paternal
discipline
with
his
obstreperous
son
.
For
Demi
inherited
a
*NL*
trifle
of
his
sire
's
firmness
of
character
,
--
we
wo
n't
call
it
*NL*
obstinacy
,
--
and
when
he
made
up
his
little
mind
to
have
or
to
do
*NL*
anything
,
all
the
king
's
horses
and
all
the
king
's
men
could
not
change
*NL*
that
pertinacious
little
mind
.
Mamma
thought
the
dear
too
young
to
be
*NL*
taught
to
conquer
his
prejudices
,
but
papa
believed
that
it
never
was
*NL*
too
soon
to
learn
obedience
;
so
Master
Demi
early
discovered
that
when
*NL*
he
undertook
to
``
wrastle
''
with
``
parpar
,
''
he
always
got
the
worst
of
it
;
*NL*
yet
,
like
the
Englishman
,
Baby
respected
the
man
who
conquered
him
,
and
*NL*
loved
the
father
whose
grave
``
No
,
no
,
''
was
more
impressive
than
all
*NL*
mamma
's
love-pats
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
days
after
the
talk
with
her
mother
,
Meg
resolved
to
try
a
social
*NL*
evening
with
John
;
so
she
ordered
a
nice
supper
,
set
the
parlor
in
*NL*
order
,
dressed
herself
prettily
,
and
put
the
children
to
bed
early
,
that
*NL*
nothing
should
interfere
with
her
experiment
.
But
,
unfortunately
,
Demi
's
*NL*
most
unconquerable
prejudice
was
against
going
to
bed
,
and
that
night
he
*NL*
decided
to
go
on
a
rampage
;
so
poor
Meg
sung
and
rocked
,
told
stories
*NL*
and
tried
every
sleep-provoking
wile
she
could
devise
,
but
all
in
vain
,
*NL*
the
big
eyes
would
n't
shut
;
and
long
after
Daisy
had
gone
to
byelow
,
*NL*
like
the
chubby
little
bunch
of
good-nature
she
was
,
naughty
Demi
lay
*NL*
staring
at
the
light
,
with
the
most
discouragingly
wide-awake
expression
*NL*
of
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
Demi
lie
still
like
a
good
boy
,
while
mamma
runs
down
and
gives
*NL*
poor
papa
his
tea
?
''
asked
Meg
,
as
the
hall-door
softly
closed
,
and
the
*NL*
well-known
step
went
tiptoeing
into
the
dining-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
has
tea
!
''
said
Demi
,
preparing
to
join
in
the
revel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
I
'll
save
you
some
little
cakies
for
breakfast
,
if
you
'll
go
*NL*
bye-by
like
Daisy
.
Will
you
,
lovey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iss
!
''
and
Demi
shut
his
eyes
tight
,
as
if
to
catch
sleep
and
hurry
the
*NL*
desired
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Taking
advantage
of
the
propitious
moment
,
Meg
slipped
away
,
and
ran
*NL*
down
to
greet
her
husband
with
a
smiling
face
,
and
the
little
blue
bow
*NL*
in
her
hair
which
was
his
especial
admiration
.
He
saw
it
at
once
,
and
*NL*
said
,
with
pleased
surprise
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
little
mother
,
how
gay
we
are
to-night
.
Do
you
expect
company
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
you
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
a
birthday
,
anniversary
,
or
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
'm
tired
of
being
a
dowdy
,
so
I
dressed
up
as
a
change
.
You
always
*NL*
make
yourself
nice
for
table
,
no
matter
how
tired
you
are
;
so
why
*NL*
should
n't
I
when
I
have
the
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
it
out
of
respect
to
you
,
my
dear
,
''
said
old-fashioned
John
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ditto
,
ditto
,
Mr.
Brooke
,
''
laughed
Meg
,
looking
young
and
pretty
again
,
*NL*
as
she
nodded
to
him
over
the
teapot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
altogether
delightful
,
and
like
old
times
.
This
tastes
*NL*
right
.
I
drink
your
health
,
dear
.
''
And
John
sipped
his
tea
with
an
air
*NL*
of
reposeful
rapture
,
which
was
of
very
short
duration
,
however
;
for
,
as
*NL*
he
put
down
his
cup
,
the
door-handle
rattled
mysteriously
,
and
a
little
*NL*
voice
was
heard
,
saying
impatiently
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Opy
doy
;
me
's
tummin
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
that
naughty
boy
.
I
told
him
to
go
to
sleep
alone
,
and
here
he
is
,
*NL*
downstairs
,
getting
his
death
a-cold
pattering
over
that
canvas

said
*NL*
Meg
,
answering
the
call
.

*NL*
``

announced
Demi
,
in
a
joyful
tone
,
as
he
entered
,
with
his
*NL*
long
night-gown
gracefully
festooned
over
his
arm
,
and
every
curl
*NL*
bobbing
gayly
as
he
pranced
about
the
table
,
eying
the
``

with
*NL*
loving
glances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
the
artful
one
,
preparing
to
climb
the
paternal
*NL*
knee
,
and
revel
in
forbidden
joys
.
But
John
shook
his
head
,
and
said
to
*NL*
Meg
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
told
him

stay
up

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

of

Come

Demi

''
and
Meg
led
her
son
away
,
feeling
a
*NL*
strong
desire
to
spank
the
little
marplot
who
hopped
beside
her
,
*NL*
laboring
under
the
delusion
that
the
bribe
was
to
be
administered
as
*NL*
soon
as
they
reached
the
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
was
he
disappointed
;
for
that
short-sighted
woman
actually
gave
him
*NL*
a
lump
of
sugar
,
tucked
him
into
his
bed
,
and
forbade
any
more
*NL*
promenades
till
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Iss
!
''
said
Demi
the
perjured
,
blissfully
sucking
his
sugar
,
and
*NL*
regarding
his
first
attempt
as
eminently
successful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
returned
to
her
place
,
and
supper
was
progressing
pleasantly
,
when
*NL*
the
little
ghost
walked
again
,
and
exposed
the
maternal
delinquencies
by
*NL*
boldly
demanding
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
sudar
,
marmar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
this
wo
n't
do

''
said
John
,
hardening
his
heart
against
the
engaging
*NL*
little
sinner
.
``
We
shall
never
know
any
peace
till
that
child
learns
to
*NL*
go
to

properly

You
have
made
a
slave
of
yourself
long
enough
;
give
*NL*
him
one
lesson
,
and
then
there
will
be
an
end
of
it

Put

*NL*
and
leave

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
wo
n't

he
never
does

unless

sit
by

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

Demi

go

,
and
get
into
your
bed
,
as

you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
S'ant

''
replied
the
young
rebel
,
helping
himself
to
the
coveted
*NL*
``
cakie
,
''
and
beginning
to
eat
the
same
with
calm
audacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
never
say
that
to

I
shall
carry
you
if
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
`
way
;
me
do
n't
love
parpar
;
''
and
Demi
retired
to
his
mother
's
skirts
*NL*
for
protection
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
even
that
refuge
proved
unavailing
,
for
he
was
delivered
over
to
the
*NL*
enemy
,
with
a
``
Be
gentle
with
him
,
John
,
''
which
struck
the
culprit
with
*NL*
dismay
;
for
when
mamma
deserted
him
,
then
the
judgment-day
was
at
hand
.
*NL*
Bereft
of
his
cake
,
defrauded
of
his
frolic
,
and
borne
away
by
a
strong
*NL*
hand
to
that
detested
bed
,
poor
Demi
could
not
restrain
his
wrath
,
but
*NL*
openly
defied
papa
,
and
kicked
and
screamed
lustily
all
the
way
*NL*
upstairs
.
The
minute
he
was
put
into
bed
on
one
side
,
he
rolled
out
on
*NL*
the
other
,
and
made
for
the
door
,
only
to
be
ignominiously
caught
up
by
*NL*
the
tail
of
his
little
toga
,
and
put
back
again
,
which
lively
*NL*
performance
was
kept
up
till
the
young
man
's
strength
gave
out
,
when
he
*NL*
devoted
himself
to
roaring
at
the
top
of
his
voice
.
This
vocal
exercise
*NL*
usually
conquered
Meg
;
but
John
sat
as
unmoved
as
the
post
which
is
*NL*
popularly
believed
to
be
deaf
.
No
coaxing
,
no
sugar
,
no
lullaby
,
no
*NL*
story
;
even
the
light
was
put
out
,
and
only
the
red
glow
of
the
fire
*NL*
enlivened
the
``
big
dark
''
which
Demi
regarded
with
curiosity
rather
than
*NL*
fear
.
This
new
order
of
things
disgusted
him
,
and
he
howled
dismally
for
*NL*
``
marmar
,
''
as
his
angry
passions
subsided
,
and
recollections
of
his
*NL*
tender
bondwoman
returned
to
the
captive
autocrat
.
The
plaintive
wail
*NL*
which
succeeded
the
passionate
roar
went
to
Meg
's
heart
,
and
she
ran
up
*NL*
to
say
beseechingly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
stay
with
him
;
he
'll
be
good
,
now
,
John
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
I
've
told
him
he
must
go
to
sleep
,
as
you
bid
him
;
and
he
*NL*
must
,
if
I
stay
here
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
'll
cry
himself
sick
,
''
pleaded
Meg
,
reproaching
herself
for
*NL*
deserting
her
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
he
wo
n't
,
he
's
so
tired
he
will
soon
drop
off
,
and
then
the
matter
*NL*
is
settled
;
for
he
will
understand
that
he
has
got
to
mind
.
Do
n't
*NL*
interfere
;
I
'll
manage
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
my
child
,
and
I
ca
n't
have
his
spirit
broken
by
harshness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
my
child

and
I
wo
n't
have
his
temper
spoilt
by
indulgence
.
Go
*NL*
down
,
my
dear
,
and
leave
the
boy
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
John
spoke
in
that
masterful
tone
,
Meg
always
obeyed
,
and
never
*NL*
regretted
her
docility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
let
me
kiss
him
once
,
John
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
Demi
,
say
`
good-night
'
to
mamma
,
and
let
her
go
and
rest
,
*NL*
for
she
is
very
tired
with
taking
care
of
you
all
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
always
insisted
upon
it
that
the
kiss
won
the
victory
;
for
after
it
*NL*
was
given
,
Demi
sobbed
more
quietly
,
and
lay
quite
still
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
bed
,
whither
he
had
wriggled
in
his
anguish
of
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
man
,
he
's
worn
out
with
sleep
and
crying
.
I
'll
cover
him
*NL*
up
,
and
then
go
and
set
Meg
's
heart
at
rest
,
''
thought
John
,
creeping
to
*NL*
the
bedside
,
hoping
to
find
his
rebellious
heir
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
n't
;
for
the
moment
his
father
peeped
at
him
,
Demi
's
eyes
*NL*
opened
,
his
little
chin
began
to
quiver
,
and
he
put
up
his
arms
,
saying
,
*NL*
with
a
penitent
hiccough
,
``
Me
's
dood
,
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sitting
on
the
stairs
,
outside
,
Meg
wondered
at
the
long
silence
which
*NL*
followed
the
uproar
;
and
,
after
imagining
all
sorts
of
impossible
*NL*
accidents
,
she
slipped
into
the
room
,
to
set
her
fears
at
rest
.
Demi
lay
*NL*
fast
asleep
;
not
in
his
usual
spread-eagle
attitude
,
but
in
a
subdued
*NL*
bunch
,
cuddled
close
in
the
circle
of
his
father
's
arm
and
holding
his
*NL*
father
's
finger
,
as
if
he
felt
that
justice
was
tempered
with
mercy
,
and
*NL*
had
gone
to
sleep
a
sadder
and
a
wiser
baby
.
So
held
,
John
had
waited
*NL*
with
womanly
patience
till
the
little
hand
relaxed
its
hold
;
and
,
while
*NL*
waiting
,
had
fallen
asleep
,
more
tired
by
that
tussle
with
his
son
than
*NL*
with
his
whole
day
's
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Meg
stood
watching
the
two
faces
on
the
pillow
,
she
smiled
to
*NL*
herself
,
and
then
slipped
away
again
,
saying
,
in
a
satisfied
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
need
fear
that
John
will
be
too
harsh
with
my
babies
:
he
_
does
_
*NL*
know
how
to
manage
them
,
and
will
be
a
great
help
,
for
Demi
_
is
_
getting
*NL*
too
much
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
John
came
down
at
last
,
expecting
to
find
a
pensive
or
reproachful
*NL*
wife
,
he
was
agreeably
surprised
to
find
Meg
placidly
trimming
a
bonnet
,
*NL*
and
to
be
greeted
with
the
request
to
read
something
about
the
election
,
*NL*
if
he
was
not
too
tired
.
John
saw
in
a
minute
that
a
revolution
of
some
*NL*
kind
was
going
on
,
but
wisely
asked
no
questions
,
knowing
that
Meg
was
*NL*
such
a
transparent
little
person
,
she
could
n't
keep
a
secret
to
save
her
*NL*
life
,
and
therefore
the
clew
would
soon
appear
.
He
read
a
long
debate
*NL*
with
the
most
amiable
readiness
,
and
then
explained
it
in
his
most
lucid
*NL*
manner
,
while
Meg
tried
to
look
deeply
interested
,
to
ask
intelligent
*NL*
questions
,
and
keep
her
thoughts
from
wandering
from
the
state
of
the
*NL*
nation
to
the
state
of
her
bonnet
.
In
her
secret
soul
,
however
,
she
*NL*
decided
that
politics
were
as
bad
as
mathematics
,
and
that
the
mission
*NL*
of
politicians
seemed
to
be
calling
each
other
names
;
but
she
kept
these
*NL*
feminine
ideas
to
herself
,
and
when
John
paused
,
shook
her
head
,
and
*NL*
said
with
what
she
thought
diplomatic
ambiguity
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
really
do
n't
see
what
we
are
coming
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
John
laughed
,
and
watched
her
for
a
minute
,
as
she
poised
a
pretty
*NL*
little
preparation
of
lace
and
flowers
on
her
hand
,
and
regarded
it
with
*NL*
the
genuine
interest
which
his
harangue
had
failed
to
waken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
trying
to
like
politics
for
my
sake
,
so
I
'll
try
and
like
*NL*
millinery
for
hers
,
that
's
only
fair

''
thought
John
the
Just
,
adding
*NL*
aloud
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
very
pretty
;
is
it
what
you
call

``

and
*NL*
Meg
illustrated
by
putting
on
the
bonnet
,
and
regarding
him
with
an
air

of
calm
satisfaction
that
was
irresistible

*NL*
*NL*

and
John
kissed
the
smiling
face
,
to
the
great
*NL*
detriment
of
the
rosebud
under
the
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
had
a
talk
with
Marmee
the

and
told
her
how
nervous

cross
and
out
of

I
felt

she
said
I
needed

I
'm
to

then
have

*NL*
I
'm
going
to
make
home
what
it
used
to
be
,
if
I
can
.
You
do
n't
object
,
I
*NL*
hope
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Never
mind
what
John
said
,
or
what
a
very
narrow
escape
the
little
*NL*
bonnet
had
from
utter
ruin
;
all
that
we
have
any
business
to
know
,
is
*NL*
that
John
did
_
not
_
appear
to
object
,
judging
from
the
changes
which
*NL*
gradually
took
place
in
the
house
and
its
inmates
.
It
was
not
all
*NL*
Paradise
by
any
means
,
but
every
one
was
better
for
the
division
of
*NL*
labor
system
;
the
children
throve
under
the
paternal
rule
,
for
accurate
,
*NL*
steadfast
John
brought
order
and
obedience
into
Babydom
,
while
Meg
*NL*
recovered
her
spirits
and
composed
her
nerves
by
plenty
of
wholesome
*NL*
exercise
,
a
little
pleasure
,
and
much
confidential
conversation
with
her
*NL*
sensible
husband
.
Home
grew
home-like
again
,
and
John
had
no
wish
to
*NL*
leave
it
,
unless
he
took
Meg
with
him
.
The
Scotts
came
to
the
Brookes
'
*NL*
now
,
and
every
one
found
the
little
house
a
cheerful
place
,
full
of
*NL*
happiness
,
content
,
and
family
love
.
Even
gay
Sallie
Moffatt
liked
to
go
*NL*
there
.
``
It
is
always
so
quiet
and
pleasant
here
;
it
does
me
good
,
Meg
,
''
*NL*
she
used
to
say
,
looking
about
her
with
wistful
eyes
,
as
if
trying
to
*NL*
discover
the
charm
,
that
she
might
use
it
in
her
great
house
,
full
of
*NL*
splendid
loneliness
;
for
there
were
no
riotous
,
sunny-faced
babies
*NL*
there
,
and
Ned
lived
in
a
world
of
his
own
,
where
there
was
no
place
for
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
household
happiness
did
not
come
all
at
once
,
but
John
and
Meg
had
*NL*
found
the
key
to
it
,
and
each
year
of
married
life
taught
them
how
to
*NL*
use
it
,
unlocking
the
treasuries
of
real
home-love
and
mutual
*NL*
helpfulness
,
which
the
poorest
may
possess
,
and
the
richest
can
not
buy
.
*NL*
This
is
the
sort
of
shelf
on
which
young
wives
and
mothers
may
consent
*NL*
to
be
laid
,
safe
from
the
restless
fret
and
fever
of
the
world
,
finding
*NL*
loyal
lovers
in
the
little
sons
and
daughters
who
cling
to
them
,
*NL*
undaunted
by
sorrow
,
poverty
,
or
age
;
walking
side
by
side
,
through
fair
*NL*
and
stormy
weather
,
with
a
faithful
friend
,
who
is
,
in
the
true
sense
of
*NL*
the
good
old
Saxon
word
,
the
``
house-band
,
''
and
learning
,
as
Meg
learned
,
*NL*
that
a
woman
's
happiest
kingdom
is
home
,
her
highest
honor
the
art
of
*NL*
ruling
it
,
not
as
a
queen
,
but
a
wise
wife
and
mother
.

LAZY
LAURENCE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
went
to
Nice
intending
to
stay
a
week
,
and
remained
a
month
.
He
*NL*
was
tired
of
wandering
about
alone
,
and
Amy
's
familiar
presence
seemed
*NL*
to
give
a
home-like
charm
to
the
foreign
scenes
in
which
she
bore
a
*NL*
part
.
He
rather
missed
the
``
petting
''
he
used
to
receive
,
and
enjoyed
a
*NL*
taste
of
it
again
;
for
no
attentions
,
however
flattering
,
from
*NL*
strangers
,
were
half
so
pleasant
as
the
sisterly
adoration
of
the
girls
*NL*
at
home
.
Amy
never
would
pet
him
like
the
others
,
but
she
was
very
glad
*NL*
to
see
him
now
,
and
quite
clung
to
him
,
feeling
that
he
was
the
*NL*
representative
of
the
dear
family
for
whom
she
longed
more
than
she
*NL*
would
confess
.
They
naturally
took
comfort
in
each
other
's
society
,
and
*NL*
were
much
together
,
riding
,
walking
,
dancing
,
or
dawdling
,
for
,
at
Nice
,
*NL*
no
one
can
be
very
industrious
during
the
gay
season
.
But
,
while
*NL*
apparently
amusing
themselves
in
the
most
careless
fashion
,
they
were
*NL*
half-consciously
making
discoveries
and
forming
opinions
about
each
*NL*
other
.
Amy
rose
daily
in
the
estimation
of
her
friend
,
but
he
sunk
in
*NL*
hers
,
and
each
felt
the
truth
before
a
word
was
spoken
.
Amy
tried
to
*NL*
please
,
and
succeeded
,
for
she
was
grateful
for
the
many
pleasures
he
*NL*
gave
her
,
and
repaid
him
with
the
little
services
to
which
womanly
women
*NL*
know
how
to
lend
an
indescribable
charm
.
Laurie
made
no
effort
of
any
*NL*
kind
,
but
just
let
himself
drift
along
as
comfortably
as
possible
,
*NL*
trying
to
forget
,
and
feeling
that
all
women
owed
him
a
kind
word
*NL*
because
one
had
been
cold
to
him
.
It
cost
him
no
effort
to
be
generous
,
*NL*
and
he
would
have
given
Amy
all
the
trinkets
in
Nice
if
she
would
have
*NL*
taken
them
;
but
,
at
the
same
time
,
he
felt
that
he
could
not
change
the
*NL*
opinion
she
was
forming
of
him
,
and
he
rather
dreaded
the
keen
blue
eyes
*NL*
that
seemed
to
watch
him
with
such
half-sorrowful
,
half-scornful
*NL*
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
rest
have
gone
to
Monaco
for
the
day
;
I
preferred
to
stay
at
*NL*
home
and
write
letters
.
They
are
done
now
,
and
I
am
going
to
Valrosa
to
*NL*
sketch
;
will
you
come
?
''
said
Amy
,
as
she
joined
Laurie
one
lovely
day
*NL*
when
he
lounged
in
as
usual
,
about
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
;
but
is
n't
it
rather
warm
for
such
a
long
walk
?
''
he
answered
*NL*
slowly
,
for
the
shaded
_
salon
_
looked
inviting
,
after
the
glare
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
have
the
little
carriage
,
and
Baptiste
can
drive
,
so
*NL*
you
'll
have
nothing
to
do
but
hold
your
umbrella
and
keep
your
gloves
*NL*
nice
,
''
returned
Amy
,
with
a
sarcastic
glance
at
the
immaculate
kids
,
*NL*
which
were
a
weak
point
with
Laurie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
'll
go
with
pleasure
;
''
and
he
put
out
his
hand
for
her
*NL*
sketch-book
.
But
she
tucked
it
under
her
arm
with
a
sharp
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
trouble
yourself
;
it
's
no
exertion
to
me
,
but
_
you
_
do
n't
look
*NL*
equal
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
lifted
his
eyebrows
,
and
followed
at
a
leisurely
pace
as
she
ran
*NL*
downstairs
;
but
when
they
got
into
the
carriage
he
took
the
reins
*NL*
himself
,
and
left
little
Baptiste
nothing
to
do
but
fold
his
arms
and
*NL*
fall
asleep
on
his
perch
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
never
quarrelled
,
--
Amy
was
too
well-bred
,
and
just
now
Laurie
*NL*
was
too
lazy
;
so
,
in
a
minute
he
peeped
under
her
hat-brim
with
an
*NL*
inquiring
air
;
she
answered
with
a
smile
,
and
they
went
on
together
in
*NL*
the
most
amicable
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
lovely
drive
,
along
winding
roads
rich
in
the
picturesque
*NL*
scenes
that
delight
beauty-loving
eyes
.
Here
an
ancient
monastery
,
*NL*
whence
the
solemn
chanting
of
the
monks
came
down
to
them
.
There
a
*NL*
bare-legged
shepherd
,
in
wooden
shoes
,
pointed
hat
,
and
rough
jacket
*NL*
over
one
shoulder
,
sat
piping
on
a
stone
,
while
his
goats
skipped
among
*NL*
the
rocks
or
lay
at
his
feet
.
Meek
,
mouse-colored
donkeys
,
laden
with
*NL*
panniers
of
freshly-cut
grass
,
passed
by
,
with
a
pretty
girl
in
a
*NL*
_
capaline
_
sitting
between
the
green
piles
,
or
an
old
woman
spinning
*NL*
with
a
distaff
as
she
went
.
Brown
,
soft-eyed
children
ran
out
from
the
*NL*
quaint
stone
hovels
to
offer
nosegays
,
or
bunches
of
oranges
still
on
*NL*
the
bough
.
Gnarled
olive-trees
covered
the
hills
with
their
dusky
*NL*
foliage
,
fruit
hung
golden
in
the
orchard
,
and
great
scarlet
anemones
*NL*
fringed
the
roadside
;
while
beyond
green
slopes
and
craggy
heights
,
the
*NL*
Maritime
Alps
rose
sharp
and
white
against
the
blue
Italian
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Valrosa
well
deserved
its
name
,
for
,
in
that
climate
of
perpetual
*NL*
summer
,
roses
blossomed
everywhere
.
They
overhung
the
archway
,
thrust
*NL*
themselves
between
the
bars
of
the
great
gate
with
a
sweet
welcome
to
*NL*
passers-by
,
and
lined
the
avenue
,
winding
through
lemon-trees
and
*NL*
feathery
palms
up
to
the
villa
on
the
hill
.
Every
shadowy
nook
,
where
*NL*
seats
invited
one
to
stop
and
rest
,
was
a
mass
of
bloom
;
every
cool
*NL*
grotto
had
its
marble
nymph
smiling
from
a
veil
of
flowers
,
and
every
*NL*
fountain
reflected
crimson
,
white
,
or
pale
pink
roses
,
leaning
down
to
*NL*
smile
at
their
own
beauty
.
Roses
covered
the
walls
of
the
house
,
draped
*NL*
the
cornices
,
climbed
the
pillars
,
and
ran
riot
over
the
balustrade
of
*NL*
the
wide
terrace
,
whence
one
looked
down
on
the
sunny
Mediterranean
,
and
*NL*
the
white-walled
city
on
its
shore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
regular
honeymoon
Paradise
,
is
n't
it
?
Did
you
ever
see
such
*NL*
roses
?
''
asked
Amy
,
pausing
on
the
terrace
to
enjoy
the
view
,
and
a
*NL*
luxurious
whiff
of
perfume
that
came
wandering
by
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
nor
felt
such
thorns
,
''
returned
Laurie
,
with
his
thumb
in
his
*NL*
mouth
,
after
a
vain
attempt
to
capture
a
solitary
scarlet
flower
that
*NL*
grew
just
beyond
his
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
lower
down
,
and
pick
those
that
have
no
thorns
,
''
said
Amy
,
*NL*
gathering
three
of
the
tiny
cream-colored
ones
that
starred
the
wall
*NL*
behind
her
.
She
put
them
in
his
button-hole
,
as
a
peace-offering
,
and
he
*NL*
stood
a
minute
looking
down
at
them
with
a
curious
expression
,
for
in
*NL*
the
Italian
part
of
his
nature
there
was
a
touch
of
superstition
,
and
*NL*
he
was
just
then
in
that
state
of
half-sweet
,
half-bitter
melancholy
,
*NL*
when
imaginative
young
men
find
significance
in
trifles
,
and
food
for
*NL*
romance
everywhere
.
He
had
thought
of
Jo
in
reaching
after
the
thorny
*NL*
red
rose
,
for
vivid
flowers
became
her
,
and
she
had
often
worn
ones
like
*NL*
that
from
the
greenhouse
at
home
.
The
pale
roses
Amy
gave
him
were
the
*NL*
sort
that
the
Italians
lay
in
dead
hands
,
never
in
bridal
wreaths
,
and
,
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
he
wondered
if
the
omen
was
for
Jo
or
for
himself
;
but
the
*NL*
next
instant
his
American
common-sense
got
the
better
of
sentimentality
,
*NL*
and
he
laughed
a
heartier
laugh
than
Amy
had
heard
since
he
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
good
advice
;
you
'd
better
take
it
and
save
your
fingers
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
thinking
her
speech
amused
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
I
will
,
''
he
answered
in
jest
,
and
a
few
months
later
he
did
*NL*
it
in
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laurie
,
when
are
you
going
to
your
grandfather
?
''
she
asked
presently
,
*NL*
as
she
settled
herself
on
a
rustic
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
said
that
a
dozen
times
within
the
last
three
weeks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
;
short
answers
save
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
expects
you
,
and
you
really
ought
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hospitable
creature
!
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
n't
you
do
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natural
depravity
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Natural
indolence
,
you
mean
.
It
's
really
dreadful
!
''
and
Amy
looked
*NL*
severe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
bad
as
it
seems
,
for
I
should
only
plague
him
if
I
went
,
so
I
*NL*
might
as
well
stay
,
and
plague
you
a
little
longer
,
you
can
bear
it
*NL*
better
;
in
fact
,
I
think
it
agrees
with
you
excellently
;
''
and
Laurie
*NL*
composed
himself
for
a
lounge
on
the
broad
ledge
of
the
balustrade
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
shook
her
head
,
and
opened
her
sketch-book
with
an
air
of
*NL*
resignation
;
but
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
lecture
``
that
boy
,
''
and
in
*NL*
a
minute
she
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
doing
just
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Watching
lizards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
I
mean
what
do
you
intend
and
wish
to
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smoke
a
cigarette
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
provoking
you
are
!
I
do
n't
approve
of
cigars
,
and
I
will
only
allow
*NL*
it
on
condition
that
you
let
me
put
you
into
my
sketch

I
need
a

figure

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all

me

full-length

three-quarters

on
my
head

my
heels

I
should
respectfully
suggest
a

recumbent
posture
,
then
put
yourself
in
also
,
and
call
it

_

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
as
you
are

and
go
to
sleep
if
you
like
.
_
I
_
intend
to
work
hard

''
*NL*
said
Amy
,
in
her
most
energetic
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
delightful
enthusiasm
!
''
and
he
leaned
against
a
tall
urn
with
an
*NL*
air
of
entire
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
would
Jo
say
if
she
saw
you
now
?
''
asked
Amy
impatiently
,
hoping
to
*NL*
stir
him
up
by
the
mention
of
her
still
more
energetic
sister
's
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
usual
,
`
Go
away
,
Teddy
,
I
'm
busy
!

''
He
laughed
as
he
spoke
,
but
the
*NL*
laugh
was
not
natural
,
and
a
shade
passed
over
his
face
,
for
the
*NL*
utterance
of
the
familiar
name
touched
the
wound
that
was
not
healed
*NL*
yet
.
Both
tone
and
shadow
struck
Amy
,
for
she
had
seen
and
heard
them
*NL*
before
,
and
now
she
looked
up
in
time
to
catch
a
new
expression
on
*NL*
Laurie
's
face
,
--
a
hard
,
bitter
look
,
full
of
pain
,
dissatisfaction
,
and
*NL*
regret
.
It
was
gone
before
she
could
study
it
,
and
the
listless
*NL*
expression
back
again
.
She
watched
him
for
a
moment
with
artistic
*NL*
pleasure
,
thinking
how
like
an
Italian
he
looked
,
as
he
lay
basking
in
*NL*
the
sun
with
uncovered
head
,
and
eyes
full
of
southern
dreaminess
;
for
*NL*
he
seemed
to
have
forgotten
her
,
and
fallen
into
a
reverie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
like
the
effigy
of
a
young
knight
asleep
on
his
tomb
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
carefully
tracing
the
well-cut
profile
defined
against
the
dark
*NL*
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
I
was
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
foolish
wish
,
unless
you
have
spoilt
your
life
.
You
are
so
*NL*
changed
,
I
sometimes
think
--
''
there
Amy
stopped
,
with
a
half-timid
,
*NL*
half-wistful
look
,
more
significant
than
her
unfinished
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
saw
and
understood
the
affectionate
anxiety
which
she
hesitated
*NL*
to
express
,
and
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
,
said
,
just
as
he
used
to
*NL*
say
it
to
her
mother
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
satisfied
her
and
set
at
rest
the
doubts
that
had
begun
to
worry
*NL*
her
lately
.
It
also
touched
her
,
and
she
showed
that
it
did
,
by
the
*NL*
cordial
tone
in
which
she
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
of
that
!
I
did
n't
think
you
'd
been
a
very
bad
boy
,
but
I
*NL*
fancied
you
might
have
wasted
money
at
that
wicked
Baden-Baden
,
lost
*NL*
your
heart
to
some
charming
Frenchwoman
with
a
husband
,
or
got
into
some
*NL*
of
the
scrapes
that
young
men
seem
to
consider
a
necessary
part
of
a
*NL*
foreign
tour
.
Do
n't
stay
out
there
in
the
sun
;
come
and
lie
on
the
grass
*NL*
here
,
and
`
let
us
be
friendly
,
'
as
Jo
used
to
say
when
we
got
in
the
*NL*
sofa-corner
and
told
secrets
.

*NL*
Laurie
obediently
threw
himself
down
on
the
turf
,
and
began
to
amuse
*NL*
himself
by
sticking
daisies
into
the
ribbons
of
Amy
's
hat
,
that
lay
*NL*
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
all
ready
for

and
he
glanced
up
with
a
decided
*NL*
expression
of
interest
in
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
none
to
tell

may
begin

*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

about

know
.
When
do
you
begin
your
great
work
of

Raphaella

''
he
*NL*
asked
,
changing
the
subject
abruptly
after
another
pause
,
in
which
he
*NL*
had
been
wondering
if
Amy
knew
his
secret
,
and
wanted
to
talk
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
she
answered
,
with
a
despondent
but
decided
air
.
``
Rome
took
all
*NL*
the
vanity
out
of
me
;
for
after
seeing
the
wonders
there
,
I
felt
too
*NL*
insignificant
to
live
,
and
gave
up
all
my
foolish
hopes
in
despair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
,
with
so
much
energy
and
talent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
just
why
,
--
because
talent
is
n't
genius
,
and
no
amount
of
energy
*NL*
can
make
it
so
.
I
want
to
be
great
,
or
nothing
.
I
wo
n't
be
a
*NL*
common-place
dauber
,
so
I
do
n't
intend
to
try
any
more
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
yourself
now

I
may
ask
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Polish
up
my

an
ornament

if
I
get
the
*NL*
chance

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
characteristic
speech
,
and
sounded
daring
;
but
audacity
becomes
*NL*
young
people
,
and
Amy
's
ambition
had
a
good
foundation
.
Laurie
smiled
,
*NL*
but
he
liked
the
spirit
with
which
she
took
up
a
new
purpose
when
a
*NL*
long-cherished
one
died
,
and
spent
no
time
lamenting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
and
here
is
where
Fred
Vaughn
comes
in
,
I
fancy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
preserved
a
discreet
silence
,
but
there
was
a
conscious
look
in
her
*NL*
downcast
face
,
that
made
Laurie
sit
up
and
say
gravely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
'm
going
to
play
brother
,
and
ask
questions

May
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
promise

*NL*
*NL*
``
Your

You
are

woman
of
the
world
*NL*
enough
yet
to
hide
your
feelings
,
my
dear
.
I
heard
rumors
about
Fred
and
*NL*
you
last
year
,
and
it
's
my
private
opinion
that
,
if
he
had
not
been
*NL*
called
home
so
suddenly
and
detained
so
long
,
something
would
have
come
*NL*
of
it
--
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
not
for
me
to
say
,
''
was
Amy
's
prim
reply
;
but
her
lips
would
*NL*
smile
,
and
there
was
a
traitorous
sparkle
of
the
eye
,
which
betrayed
*NL*
that
she
knew
her
power
and
enjoyed
the
knowledge
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
engaged
,
I
hope
?
''
and
Laurie
looked
very
elder-brotherly
*NL*
and
grave
all
of
a
sudden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
be
,
if
he
comes
back
and
goes
properly
down
upon
his
*NL*
knees
,
wo

you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
likely

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you

*NL*
``
But
you

Bless
my

what
*NL*
unearthly
prudence
!
He
's
a
good
fellow
,
Amy
,
but
not
the
man
I
fancied
*NL*
you

like

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
rich
,
a
gentleman
,
and
has
delightful
manners
,
''
began
Amy
,
trying
*NL*
to
be
quite
cool
and
dignified
,
but
feeling
a
little
ashamed
of
herself
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
the
sincerity
of
her
intentions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
;
queens
of
society
ca
n't
get
on
without
money
,
so
you
mean
*NL*
to
make
a
good
match
,
and
start
in
that
way
?
Quite
right
and
proper
,
as
*NL*
the
world
goes
,
but
it
sounds
odd
from
the
lips
of
one
of
your
mother
's
*NL*
girls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
nevertheless
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
speech
,
but
the
quiet
decision
with
which
it
was
uttered
*NL*
contrasted
curiously
with
the
young
speaker
.
Laurie
felt
this
*NL*
instinctively
,
and
laid
himself
down
again
,
with
a
sense
of
*NL*
disappointment
which
he
could
not
explain
.
His
look
and
silence
,
as
well
*NL*
as
a
certain
inward
self-disapproval
,
ruffled
Amy
,
and
made
her
resolve
*NL*
to
deliver
her
lecture
without
delay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
'd
do
me
the
favor
to
rouse
yourself
a
little
,
''
she
said
*NL*
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
it
for
me
,
there
's
a
dear
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
,
if
I
tried
;
''
and
she
looked
as
if
she
would
like
doing
it
in
*NL*
the
most
summary
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
,
then
;
I
give
you
leave
,
''
returned
Laurie
,
who
enjoyed
having
some
*NL*
one
to
tease
,
after
his
long
abstinence
from
his
favorite
pastime
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
be
angry
in
five
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
never
angry
with
you
.
It
takes
two
flints
to
make
a
fire
:
you
are
*NL*
as
cool
and
soft
as
snow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
what
I
can
do
;
snow
produces
a
glow
and
a
tingle
,
if
*NL*
applied
rightly
.
Your
indifference
is
half
affectation
,
and
a
good
*NL*
stirring
up
would
prove
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Stir
away
;
it
wo
n't
hurt
me

it
may
amuse
you

the
big
man
said
*NL*
when
his
little
wife
beat
him
.
Regard
me
in
the
light
of
a
husband
or
a
*NL*
carpet
,

beat
till
you
are
tired

that
sort
of
exercise
agrees
*NL*
with
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Being
decidedly
nettled
herself
,
and
longing
to
see
him
shake
off
the
*NL*
apathy
that
so
altered
him
,
Amy
sharpened
both
tongue
and
pencil
,
and
*NL*
began
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Flo
and
I
have
got
a
new
name
for
you

it
's
`
Lazy
Laurence

How
do

*NL*
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
it
would
annoy
him
;
but
he
only
folded
his
arms
under
his
*NL*
head
,
with
an
imperturbable
``
That
's
not
bad
.
Thank
you

ladies

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
know

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
despise
you

*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
even
said
``
I
hate
you
,
''
in
a
petulant
or
coquettish
tone
,
he
*NL*
would
have
laughed
,
and
rather
liked
it
;
but
the
grave
,
almost
sad
,
*NL*
accent
of
her
voice
made
him
open
his
eyes
,
and
ask
quickly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
if
you
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
with
every
chance
for
being
good

useful

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Pray

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought

talk
about

themselves

*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
_
I

selfish

The
question
slipped
out
involuntarily
and
in
a
tone
*NL*
of
surprise
,
for
the
one
virtue
on
which
he
prided
himself
was
*NL*
generosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
selfish

continued
Amy
,
in
a
calm
,
cool
voice
,
twice
as
*NL*
effective
,
just
then
,
as
an
angry
one
.
``
I
'll
show
you
how
,
for
I
've
*NL*
studied
you
while
we
have
been
frolicking

and
I
'm
not
at
all
satisfied
*NL*
with
you
.
Here
you
have
been
abroad
nearly
six
months
,
and
done
nothing
*NL*
but
waste
time
and
money
and
disappoint
your
friends

*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
a

to
have
any
pleasure
after
a
four-years
grind

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
look
as

you

at
any
rate
,
you
are
none
the
*NL*
better
for
it
,
as
far
as
I
can
see
.
I
said
,
when
we
first
met
,
that
you
*NL*
had
improved
.
Now
I
take
it
all
back
,
for
I
do
n't
think
you
half
so
nice
*NL*
as
when
I
left
you
at
home
.
You
have
grown
abominably
lazy
;
you
like
*NL*
gossip
,
and
waste
time
on
frivolous
things
;
you
are
contented
to
be
*NL*
petted
and
admired
by
silly
people

instead

being
loved

respected

by
wise
ones

With
money

talent

position

health

beauty

like
that

Old
Vanity

the
truth

help
saying

it
,

with
all
these
splendid
things
to
use
and
enjoy
,
you
can
find
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
dawdle
;
and
,
instead
of
being
the
man
you
might
and
*NL*
ought
to
be
,
you
are
only
--
''
There
she
stopped
,
with
a
look
that
had
*NL*
both
pain
and
pity
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saint
Laurence
on
a
gridiron

''
added
Laurie
,
blandly
finishing
the
*NL*
sentence
.
But
the
lecture
began
to
take
effect
,
for
there
was
a
*NL*
wide-awake
sparkle
in
his
eyes
now
,
and
a
half-angry
,
half-injured
*NL*
expression
replaced
the
former
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
supposed
you
'd
take
it
so

You
men
tell
us
we
are
angels
,
and
say
we
*NL*
can
make
you
what
we
will
;
but
the
instant
we
honestly
try
to
do
you
*NL*
good
,
you
laugh
at
us
,
and
wo
n't
listen
,
which
proves
how
much
your
*NL*
flattery
is
worth
.
''
Amy
spoke
bitterly
,
and
turned
her
back
on
the
*NL*
exasperating
martyr
at
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
minute
a
hand
came
down
over
the
page
,
so
that
she
could
not
draw
,
*NL*
and
Laurie
's
voice
said
,
with
a
droll
imitation
of
a
penitent
child
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
be
good
,
oh
,
I
will
be
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amy
did
not
laugh
,
for
she
was
in
earnest
;
and
,
tapping
on
the
*NL*
outspread
hand
with
her
pencil
,
said
soberly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't
you
ashamed

It

and
looks
as
if
it
never
did
anything
but
wear
Jouvin
's
best
*NL*
gloves
,
and
pick
flowers
for
ladies
.
You
are
not
a
dandy
,
thank
Heaven
!
*NL*
so
I
'm
glad
to
see
there
are
no
diamonds
or
big
seal-rings
on
it
,
only
*NL*
the
little
old
one
Jo
gave
you
so
long
ago
.
Dear
soul
,
I
wish
she
was
*NL*
here
to
help
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hand
vanished
as
suddenly
as
it
came
,
and
there
was
energy
enough
in
*NL*
the
echo
of
her
wish
to
suit
even
Amy
.
She
glanced
down
at
him
with
a
*NL*
new
thought
in
her
mind
;
but
he
was
lying
with
his
hat
half
over
his
*NL*
face
,
as
if
for
shade
,
and
his
mustache
hid
his
mouth
.
She
only
saw
his
*NL*
chest
rise
and
fall
,
with
a
long
breath
that
might
have
been
a
sigh
,
and
*NL*
the
hand
that
wore
the
ring
nestled
down
into
the
grass
,
as
if
to
hide
*NL*
something
too
precious
or
too
tender
to
be
spoken
of
.
All
in
a
minute
*NL*
various
hints
and
trifles
assumed
shape
and
significance
in
Amy
's
mind
,
*NL*
and
told
her
what
her
sister
never
had
confided
to
her
.
She
remembered
*NL*
that
Laurie
never
spoke
voluntarily
of
Jo
;
she
recalled
the
shadow
on
*NL*
his
face
just
now
,
the
change
in
his
character
,
and
the
wearing
of
the
*NL*
little
old
ring
,
which
was
no
ornament
to
a
handsome
hand
.
Girls
are
*NL*
quick
to
read
such
signs
and
feel
their
eloquence
.
Amy
had
fancied
that
*NL*
perhaps
a
love
trouble
was
at
the
bottom
of
the
alteration
,
and
now
she
*NL*
was
sure
of
it
.
Her
keen
eyes
filled
,
and
,
when
she
spoke
again
,
it
was
*NL*
in
a
voice
that
could
be
beautifully
soft
and
kind
when
she
chose
to
*NL*
make
it
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
I
have
no
right
to
talk
so
to
you
,
Laurie
;
and
if
you
were
n't
*NL*
the
sweetest-tempered
fellow
in
the
world
,
you
'd
be
very
angry
with
me
.
*NL*
But
we
are
all
so
fond
and
proud
of
you
,
I
could
n't
bear
to
think
they
*NL*
should
be
disappointed
in
you
at
home
as
I
have
been
,
though
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
they
would
understand
the
change
better
than
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
they
would
,
''
came
from
under
the
hat
,
in
a
grim
tone
,
quite
as
*NL*
touching
as
a
broken
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
ought
to
have
told
me
,
and
not
let
me
go
blundering
and
scolding
,
*NL*
when
I
should
have
been
more
kind
and
patient
than
ever
.
I
never
did
*NL*
like
that
Miss
Randal
,
and
now
I
hate
her
!
''
said
artful
Amy
,
wishing
to
*NL*
be
sure
of
her
facts
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
Miss
Randal
!
''
and
Laurie
knocked
the
hat
off
his
face
with
a
look
*NL*
that
left
no
doubt
of
his
sentiments
toward
that
young
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
pardon
;
I
thought
--
''
and
there
she
paused
diplomatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
did
n't
;
you
knew
perfectly
well
I
never
cared
for
any
one
but
*NL*
Jo
.
''
Laurie
said
that
in
his
old
,
impetuous
tone
,
and
turned
his
face
*NL*
away
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
think
so
;
but
as
they
never
said
anything
about
it
,
and
you
came
*NL*
away
,
I
supposed
I
was
mistaken
.
And
Jo
would
n't
be
kind
to
you
?
Why
,
I
*NL*
was
sure
she
loved
you
dearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
_
was
_
kind
,
but
not
in
the
right
way
;
and
it
's
lucky
for
her
she
*NL*
did
n't
love
me
,
if
I
'm
the
good-for-nothing
fellow
you
think
me
.
It
's
*NL*
her
fault
,
though
,
and
you
may
tell
her
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
hard
,
bitter
look
came
back
again
as
he
said
that
,
and
it
troubled
*NL*
Amy
,
for
she
did
not
know
what
balm
to
apply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
wrong
,
I
did
n't
know
.
I
'm
very
sorry
I
was
so
cross
,
but
I
ca
n't
*NL*
help
wishing
you
'd
bear
it
better
,
Teddy
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
that
's
her
name
for
me
!
''
and
Laurie
put
up
his
hand
with
a
quick
*NL*
gesture
to
stop
the
words
spoken
in
Jo
's
half-kind
,
half-reproachful
*NL*
tone
.
``
Wait
till
you
've
tried
it
yourself
,
''
he
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
as
*NL*
he
pulled
up
the
grass
by
the
handful
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
take
it
manfully
,
and
be
respected
if
I
could
n't
be
loved
,
''
said
*NL*
Amy
,
with
the
decision
of
one
who
knew
nothing
about
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
Laurie
flattered
himself
that
he
_
had
_
borne
it
remarkably
well
,
*NL*
making
no
moan
,
asking
no
sympathy
,
and
taking
his
trouble
away
to
live
*NL*
it
down
alone
.
Amy
's
lecture
put
the
matter
in
a
new
light
,
and
for
the
*NL*
first
time
it
did
look
weak
and
selfish
to
lose
heart
at
the
first
*NL*
failure
,
and
shut
himself
up
in
moody
indifference
.
He
felt
as
if
*NL*
suddenly
shaken
out
of
a
pensive
dream
,
and
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
*NL*
sleep
again
.
Presently
he
sat
up
,
and
asked
slowly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
Jo
would
despise
me
as
you
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
she
saw
you
now
.
She
hates
lazy
people
.
Why
do
n't
you
do
*NL*
something
splendid
,
and
_
make
_
her
love
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
my
best
,
but
it
was
no
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Graduating
well
,
you
mean
?
That
was
no
more
than
you
ought
to
have
*NL*
done
,
for
your
grandfather
's
sake
.
It
would
have
been
shameful
to
fail
*NL*
after
spending
so
much
time
and
money
,
when
every
one
knew
you
_
could
_
*NL*
do
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
fail
,
say
what
you
will
,
for
Jo
would
n't
love
me
,
''
began
Laurie
,
*NL*
leaning
his
head
on
his
hand
in
a
despondent
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
you
did
n't
,
and
you
'll
say
so
in
the
end
,
for
it
did
you
good
,
and
*NL*
proved
that
you
could
do
something
if
you
tried
.
If
you
'd
only
set
about
*NL*
another
task
of
some
sort
,
you
'd
soon
be
your
hearty
,
happy
self
again
,
*NL*
and
forget
your
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Try
it
and
see
.
You
need
n't
shrug
your
shoulders
,
and
think
,
`
Much
she
*NL*
knows
about
such
things
.
'
I
do
n't
pretend
to
be
wise
,
but
I
_
am
_
*NL*
observing
,
and
I
see
a
great
deal
more
than
you
'd
imagine
.
I
'm
*NL*
interested
in
other
people
's
experiences
and
inconsistencies
;
and
,
*NL*
though
I
ca
n't
explain
,
I
remember
and
use
them
for
my
own
benefit
.
Love
*NL*
Jo
all
your
days
,
if
you
choose
,
but
do
n't
let
it
spoil
you
,
for
it
's
*NL*
wicked
to
throw
away
so
many
good
gifts
because
you
ca
n't
have
the
one
*NL*
you
want
.
There
,
I
wo
n't
lecture
any
more
,
for
I
know
you
'll
wake
up
and
*NL*
be
a
man
in
spite
of
that
hardhearted
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Neither
spoke
for
several
minutes
.
Laurie
sat
turning
the
little
ring
on
*NL*
his
finger
,
and
Amy
put
the
last
touches
to
the
hasty
sketch
she
had
*NL*
been
working
at
while
she
talked
.
Presently
she
put
it
on
his
knee
,
*NL*
merely
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
and
then
he
smiled
,
as
he
could
not
well
help
doing
,
for
it
*NL*
was
capitally
done
,
--
the
long
,
lazy
figure
on
the
grass
,
with
listless
*NL*
face
,
half-shut
eyes
,
and
one
hand
holding
a
cigar
,
from
which
came
the
*NL*
little
wreath
of
smoke
that
encircled
the
dreamer
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
you
draw
!
''
he
said
,
with
genuine
surprise
and
pleasure
at
her
*NL*
skill
,
adding
,
with
a
half-laugh
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you
are
:
this
is
as
you
were
;
''
and
Amy
laid
another
sketch
beside
*NL*
the
one
he
held
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
nearly
so
well
done
,
but
there
was
a
life
and
spirit
in
it
*NL*
which
atoned
for
many
faults
,
and
it
recalled
the
past
so
vividly
that
a
*NL*
sudden
change
swept
over
the
young
man
's
face
as
he
looked
.
Only
a
rough
*NL*
sketch
of
Laurie
taming
a
horse
;
hat
and
coat
were
off
,
and
every
line
*NL*
of
the
active
figure
,
resolute
face
,
and
commanding
attitude
,
was
full
*NL*
of
energy
and
meaning
.
The
handsome
brute
,
just
subdued
,
stood
arching
*NL*
his
neck
under
the
tightly
drawn
rein
,
with
one
foot
impatiently
pawing
*NL*
the
ground
,
and
ears
pricked
up
as
if
listening
for
the
voice
that
had
*NL*
mastered
him
.
In
the
ruffled
mane
,
the
rider
's
breezy
hair
and
erect
*NL*
attitude
,
there
was
a
suggestion
of
suddenly
arrested
motion
,
of
*NL*
strength
,
courage
,
and
youthful
buoyancy
,
that
contrasted
sharply
with
*NL*
the
supine
grace
of
the
''
_
Dolce
far
niente
_
''
sketch
.
Laurie
said
*NL*
nothing
;
but
,
as
his
eye
went
from
one
to
the
other
,
Amy
saw
him
flush
*NL*
up
and
fold
his
lips
together
as
if
he
read
and
accepted
the
little
*NL*
lesson
she
had
given
him
.
That
satisfied
her
;
and
,
without
waiting
for
*NL*
him
to
speak
,
she
said
,
in
her
sprightly
way
,
--

you
played
Rarey
with
Puck
,
and
we
all
*NL*
looked
on
?
Meg
and
Beth
were
frightened
,
but
Jo
clapped
and
pranced
,
and
*NL*
I
sat
on
the
fence
and
drew
you
.
I
found
that
sketch
in
my
portfolio
the
*NL*
other
day
,
touched
it
up
,
and
kept
it
to
show
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Much
obliged

You
've
improved
immensely

then

I
congratulate

May
I
venture

suggest
in
'
a
honeymoon
Paradise
'
that
five
*NL*
o'clock
is
the
dinner-hour
at
your
hotel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
rose
as
he
spoke
,
returned
the
pictures
with
a
smile
and
a
bow
,
*NL*
and
looked
at
his
watch
,
as
if
to
remind
her
that
even
moral
lectures
*NL*
should
have
an
end
.
He
tried
to
resume
his
former
easy
,
indifferent
air
,
*NL*
but
it
_
was
_
an
affectation
now
,
for
the
rousing
had
been
more
*NL*
efficacious
than
he
would
confess
.
Amy
felt
the
shade
of
coldness
in
his
*NL*
manner
,
and
said
to
herself
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
've
offended
him
.
Well
,
if
it
does
him
good
,
I
'm
glad
;
if
it
makes
*NL*
him
hate
me
,
I
'm
sorry
;
but
it
's
true
,
and
I
ca
n't
take
back
a
word
of
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
laughed
and
chatted
all
the
way
home
;
and
little
Baptiste
,
up
*NL*
behind
,
thought
that
monsieur
and
mademoiselle
were
in
charming
spirits
.
*NL*
But
both
felt
ill
at
ease
;
the
friendly
frankness
was
disturbed
,
the
*NL*
sunshine
had
a
shadow
over
it
,
and
despite
their
apparent
gayety
,
there
*NL*
was
a
secret
discontent
in
the
heart
of
each
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
we
see
you
this
evening
,
_
mon
frere
_
?
''
asked
Amy
as
they
parted
*NL*
at
her
aunt
's
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unfortunately
I
have
an
engagement
.
_
Au
revoir
,
mademoiselle
_
,
''
and
*NL*
Laurie
bent
as
if
to
kiss
her
hand
,
in
the
foreign
fashion
,
which
became
*NL*
him
better
than
many
men
.
Something
in
his
face
made
Amy
say
quickly
and
*NL*
warmly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
be
yourself
with
me
,
Laurie
,
and
part
in
the
good
old
way
.
I
'd
*NL*
rather
have
a
hearty
English
hand-shake
than
all
the
sentimental
*NL*
salutations
in
France
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-by

and
with
these
words
,
uttered
in
the
tone
she
liked
,
*NL*
Laurie
left
her
,
after
a
hand-shake
almost
painful
in
its
heartiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
instead
of
the
usual
call
,
Amy
received
a
note
which
made
*NL*
her
smile
at
the
beginning
and
sigh
at
the
end
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

``

said
Amy
,
with
an
approving
smile
;
the
*NL*
next
minute
her
face
fell
as
she
glanced
about
the
empty
room
,
adding
,
*NL*
with
an
involuntary
sigh

THE
VALLEY
OF
THE
SHADOW
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
bitterness
was
over
,
the
family
accepted
the
inevitable
,
*NL*
and
tried
to
bear
it
cheerfully
,
helping
one
another
by
the
increased
*NL*
affection
which
comes
to
bind
households
tenderly
together
in
times
of
*NL*
trouble
.
They
put
away
their
grief
,
and
each
did
his
or
her
part
toward
*NL*
making
that
last
year
a
happy
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pleasantest
room
in
the
house
was
set
apart
for
Beth
,
and
in
it
was
*NL*
gathered
everything
that
she
most
loved
,
--
flowers
,
pictures
,
her
piano
,
*NL*
the
little
work-table
,
and
the
beloved
pussies
.
Father
's
best
books
*NL*
found
their
way
there
,
mother
's
easy-chair
,
Jo
's
desk
,
Amy
's
finest
*NL*
sketches
;
and
every
day
Meg
brought
her
babies
on
a
loving
pilgrimage
,
*NL*
to
make
sunshine
for
Aunty
Beth
.
John
quietly
set
apart
a
little
sum
,
*NL*
that
he
might
enjoy
the
pleasure
of
keeping
the
invalid
supplied
with
*NL*
the
fruit
she
loved
and
longed
for
;
old
Hannah
never
wearied
of
*NL*
concocting
dainty
dishes
to
tempt
a
capricious
appetite
,
dropping
tears
*NL*
as
she
worked
;
and
from
across
the
sea
came
little
gifts
and
cheerful
*NL*
letters
,
seeming
to
bring
breaths
of
warmth
and
fragrance
from
lands
*NL*
that
know
no
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
,
cherished
like
a
household
saint
in
its
shrine
,
sat
Beth
,
tranquil
*NL*
and
busy
as
ever
;
for
nothing
could
change
the
sweet
,
unselfish
nature
,
*NL*
and
even
while
preparing
to
leave
life
,
she
tried
to
make
it
happier
for
*NL*
those
who
should
remain
behind
.
The
feeble
fingers
were
never
idle
,
and
*NL*
one
of
her
pleasures
was
to
make
little
things
for
the
school-children
*NL*
daily
passing
to
and
fro
,
--
to
drop
a
pair
of
mittens
from
her
window
for
*NL*
a
pair
of
purple
hands
,
a
needle-book
for
some
small
mother
of
many
*NL*
dolls
,
pen-wipers
for
young
penmen
toiling
through
forests
of
pot-hooks
,
*NL*
scrap-books
for
picture-loving
eyes
,
and
all
manner
of
pleasant
devices
,
*NL*
till
the
reluctant
climbers
up
the
ladder
of
learning
found
their
way
*NL*
strewn
with
flowers
,
as
it
were
,
and
came
to
regard
the
gentle
giver
as
*NL*
a
sort
of
fairy
godmother
,
who
sat
above
there
,
and
showered
down
gifts
*NL*
miraculously
suited
to
their
tastes
and
needs
.
If
Beth
had
wanted
any
*NL*
reward
,
she
found
it
in
the
bright
little
faces
always
turned
up
to
her
*NL*
window
,
with
nods
and
smiles
,
and
the
droll
little
letters
which
came
to
*NL*
her
,
full
of
blots
and
gratitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
few
months
were
very
happy
ones
,
and
Beth
often
used
to
look
*NL*
round
,
and
say
``
How
beautiful
this
is
!
''
as
they
all
sat
together
in
her
*NL*
sunny
room
,
the
babies
kicking
and
crowing
on
the
floor
,
mother
and
*NL*
sisters
working
near
,
and
father
reading
,
in
his
pleasant
voice
,
from
*NL*
the
wise
old
books
which
seemed
rich
in
good
and
comfortable
words
,
as
*NL*
applicable
now
as
when
written
centuries
ago
;
a
little
chapel
,
where
a
*NL*
paternal
priest
taught
his
flock
the
hard
lessons
all
must
learn
,
trying
*NL*
to
show
them
that
hope
can
comfort
love
,
and
faith
make
resignation
*NL*
possible
.
Simple
sermons
,
that
went
straight
to
the
souls
of
those
who
*NL*
listened
;
for
the
father
's
heart
was
in
the
minister
's
religion
,
and
the
*NL*
frequent
falter
in
the
voice
gave
a
double
eloquence
to
the
words
he
*NL*
spoke
or
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
for
all
that
this
peaceful
time
was
given
them
as
*NL*
preparation
for
the
sad
hours
to
come
;
for
,
by
and
by
,
Beth
said
the
*NL*
needle
was
``
so
heavy
,
''
and
put
it
down
forever
;
talking
wearied
her
,
*NL*
faces
troubled
her
,
pain
claimed
her
for
its
own
,
and
her
tranquil
*NL*
spirit
was
sorrowfully
perturbed
by
the
ills
that
vexed
her
feeble
*NL*
flesh
.
Ah
me
!
such
heavy
days
,
such
long
,
long
nights
,
such
aching
*NL*
hearts
and
imploring
prayers
,
when
those
who
loved
her
best
were
forced
*NL*
to
see
the
thin
hands
stretched
out
to
them
beseechingly
,
to
hear
the
*NL*
bitter
cry
,
``
Help
me
,
help
me
!
''
and
to
feel
that
there
was
no
help
.
A
*NL*
sad
eclipse
of
the
serene
soul
,
a
sharp
struggle
of
the
young
life
with
*NL*
death
;
but
both
were
mercifully
brief
,
and
then
,
the
natural
rebellion
*NL*
over
,
the
old
peace
returned
more
beautiful
than
ever
.
With
the
wreck
of
*NL*
her
frail
body
,
Beth
's
soul
grew
strong
;
and
,
though
she
said
little
,
*NL*
those
about
her
felt
that
she
was
ready
,
saw
that
the
first
pilgrim
*NL*
called
was
likewise
the
fittest
,
and
waited
with
her
on
the
shore
,
*NL*
trying
to
see
the
Shining
Ones
coming
to
receive
her
when
she
crossed
*NL*
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
never
left
her
for
an
hour
since
Beth
had
said
,
``
I
feel
stronger
when
*NL*
you
are
here
.
''
She
slept
on
a
couch
in
the
room
,
waking
often
to
renew
*NL*
the
fire
,
to
feed
,
lift
,
or
wait
upon
the
patient
creature
who
seldom
*NL*
asked
for
anything
,
and
``
tried
not
to
be
a
trouble
.
''
All
day
she
haunted
*NL*
the
room
,
jealous
of
any
other
nurse
,
and
prouder
of
being
chosen
then
*NL*
than
of
any
honor
her
life
ever
brought
her
.
Precious
and
helpful
hours
*NL*
to
Jo
,
for
now
her
heart
received
the
teaching
that
it
needed
;
lessons
*NL*
in
patience
were
so
sweetly
taught
her
that
she
could
not
fail
to
learn
*NL*
them
;
charity
for
all
,
the
lovely
spirit
that
can
forgive
and
truly
*NL*
forget
unkindness
,
the
loyalty
to
duty
that
makes
the
hardest
easy
,
and
*NL*
the
sincere
faith
that
fears
nothing
,
but
trusts
undoubtingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Often
,
when
she
woke
,
Jo
found
Beth
reading
in
her
well-worn
little
*NL*
book
,
heard
her
singing
softly
,
to
beguile
the
sleepless
night
,
or
saw
*NL*
her
lean
her
face
upon
her
hands
,
while
slow
tears
dropped
through
the
*NL*
transparent
fingers
;
and
Jo
would
lie
watching
her
,
with
thoughts
too
*NL*
deep
for
tears
,
feeling
that
Beth
,
in
her
simple
,
unselfish
way
,
was
*NL*
trying
to
wean
herself
from
the
dear
old
life
,
and
fit
herself
for
the
*NL*
life
to
come
,
by
sacred
words
of
comfort
,
quiet
prayers
,
and
the
music
*NL*
she
loved
so
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
this
did
more
for
Jo
than
the
wisest
sermons
,
the
saintliest
*NL*
hymns
,
the
most
fervent
prayers
that
any
voice
could
utter
;
for
,
with
*NL*
eyes
made
clear
by
many
tears
,
and
a
heart
softened
by
the
tenderest
*NL*
sorrow
,
she
recognized
the
beauty
of
her
sister
's
life
,
--
uneventful
,
*NL*
unambitious
,
yet
full
of
the
genuine
virtues
which
``
smell
sweet
,
and
*NL*
blossom
in
the
dust
,
''
the
self-forgetfulness
that
makes
the
humblest
on
*NL*
earth
remembered
soonest
in
heaven
,
the
true
success
which
is
possible
*NL*
to
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
when
Beth
looked
among
the
books
upon
her
table
,
to
find
*NL*
something
to
make
her
forget
the
mortal
weariness
that
was
almost
as
*NL*
hard
to
bear
as
pain
,
as
she
turned
the
leaves
of
her
old
favorite
*NL*
Pilgrim
's
Progress
,
she
found
a
little
paper
,
scribbled
over
in
Jo
's
*NL*
hand
.
The
name
caught
her
eye
,
and
the
blurred
look
of
the
lines
made
*NL*
her
sure
that
tears
had
fallen
on
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Jo
!
she
's
fast
asleep
,
so
I
wo
n't
wake
her
to
ask
leave
;
she
shows
*NL*
me
all
her
things
,
and
I
do
n't
think
she
'll
mind
if
I
look
at
this
,
''
*NL*
thought
Beth
,
with
a
glance
at
her
sister
,
who
lay
on
the
rug
,
with
the
*NL*
tongs
beside
her
,
ready
to
wake
up
the
minute
the
log
fell
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
MY
BETH
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sitting
patient
in
the
shadow
*NL*
Till
the
blessed
light
shall
come
,
*NL*
A
serene
and
saintly
presence
*NL*
Sanctifies
our
troubled
home
.
*NL*
Earthly
joys
and
hopes
and
sorrows
*NL*
Break
like
ripples
on
the
strand
*NL*
Of
the
deep
and
solemn
river
*NL*
Where
her
willing
feet
now
stand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
my
sister
,
passing
from
me
,
*NL*
Out
of
human
care
and
strife
,
*NL*
Leave
me
,
as
a
gift
,
those
virtues
*NL*
Which
have
beautified
your
life
.
*NL*
Dear
,
bequeath
me
that
great
patience
*NL*
Which
has
power
to
sustain
*NL*
A
cheerful
,
uncomplaining
spirit
*NL*
In
its
prison-house
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
,
for
I
need
it
sorely
,
*NL*
Of
that
courage
,
wise
and
sweet
,
*NL*
Which
has
made
the
path
of
duty
*NL*
Green
beneath
your
willing
feet

*NL*
Give
me
that
unselfish
nature
,
*NL*
That
with
charity
divine
*NL*
Can
pardon
wrong
for
love
's
dear
sake

*NL*
Meek

mine

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thus
our
parting
daily
loseth
*NL*
Something
of
its
bitter
pain
,
*NL*
And
while
learning
this
hard
lesson
,
*NL*
My
great
loss
becomes
my
gain
.
*NL*
For
the
touch
of
grief
will
render
*NL*
My
wild
nature
more
serene
,
*NL*
Give
to
life
new
aspirations
,
*NL*
A
new
trust
in
the
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Henceforth
,
safe
across
the
river

*NL*
I
shall
see
forevermore
*NL*
A
beloved

household
spirit
*NL*
Waiting
for
me
on
the
shore
.
*NL*
Hope
and
faith
,
born
of
my
sorrow
,
*NL*
Guardian
angels
shall
become
,
*NL*
And
the
sister
gone
before
me
*NL*
By

''
*NL*
*NL*
Blurred
and
blotted
,
faulty
and
feeble
,
as
the
lines
were
,
they
brought
*NL*
a
look
of
inexpressible
comfort
to
Beth
's
face
,
for
her
one
regret
had
*NL*
been
that
she
had
done
so
little
;
and
this
seemed
to
assure
her
that
her
*NL*
life
had
not
been
useless
,
that
her
death
would
not
bring
the
despair
*NL*
she
feared
.
As
she
sat
with
the
paper
folded
between
her
hands
,
the
*NL*
charred
log
fell
asunder
.
Jo
started
up
,
revived
the
blaze
,
and
crept
to
*NL*
the
bedside
,
hoping
Beth
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
asleep

but
so
happy

you
would
n't
care

Have
I
been
all
that
to
you

Jo
?
''
she
asked
,
with
*NL*
wistful
,
humble
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Beth
,
so
much
,
so
much
!
''
and
Jo
's
head
went
down
upon
the
pillow
,
*NL*
beside
her
sister
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
do
n't
feel
as

wasted
my
life

I
'm
not
so
good
as
you
make
*NL*
me
,
but
I
_
have
_
tried
to
do
right
;
and
now
,
when
it
's
too
late
to
*NL*
begin
even
to
do
better
,
it
's
such
a
comfort
to
know
that

loves

me
so
much

feels
as

I

helped
them
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
More
than
any
one
in

world

Beth

I
used
to
think
I
could
n't
let
*NL*
you
go
;
but
I
'm
learning
to
feel
that
I
do
n't
lose
you
;
that
you
'll
be
*NL*
more
to
me
than
ever
,
and
death
ca
n't
part
us
,
though
it
seems
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
can
not

and
I
do

fear
it
any
longer

for
I

sure
I
shall
*NL*
be
your
Beth
still
,
to
love
and
help
you
more
than

You
must
take
*NL*
my
place
,
Jo
,
and
be
everything
to
father

mother
when
I
'm
gone
.
They
*NL*
will
turn
to
you
,
do
n't
fail
them

and
if
it
's
hard
to
work
alone
,
*NL*
remember
that
I
do
n't
forget
you
,
and
that
you
'll
be
happier
in
doing
*NL*
that
than
writing
splendid
books
or
seeing
all
the
world
;
for
love
is
*NL*
the
only
thing
that
we
can
carry
with
us
when
we
go
,
and
it
makes
the
*NL*
end
so
easy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
,
Beth
;
''
and
then
and
there
Jo
renounced
her
old
ambition
,
*NL*
pledged
herself
to
a
new
and
better
one
,
acknowledging
the
poverty
of
*NL*
other
desires
,
and
feeling
the
blessed
solace
of
a
belief
in
the
*NL*
immortality
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
spring
days
came
and
went
,
the
sky
grew
clearer
,
the
earth
*NL*
greener
,
the
flowers
were
up
fair
and
early
,
and
the
birds
came
back
in
*NL*
time
to
say
good-by
to
Beth
,
who
,
like
a
tired
but
trustful
child
,
clung
*NL*
to
the
hands
that
had
led
her
all
her
life
,
as
father
and
mother
guided
*NL*
her
tenderly
through
the
Valley
of
the
Shadow
,
and
gave
her
up
to
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seldom
,
except
in
books
,
do
the
dying
utter
memorable
words
,
see
*NL*
visions
,
or
depart
with
beatified
countenances
;
and
those
who
have
sped
*NL*
many
parting
souls
know
that
to
most
the
end
comes
as
naturally
and
*NL*
simply
as
sleep
.
As
Beth
had
hoped
,
the
``
tide
went
out
easily
;
''
and
in
*NL*
the
dark
hour
before
the
dawn
,
on
the
bosom
where
she
had
drawn
her
*NL*
first
breath
,
she
quietly
drew
her
last
,
with
no
farewell
but
one
loving
*NL*
look
,
one
little
sigh
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
tears
and
prayers
and
tender
hands
,
mother
and
sisters
made
her
*NL*
ready
for
the
long
sleep
that
pain
would
never

again
,
seeing
with
*NL*
grateful
eyes
the
beautiful
serenity
that
soon
replaced
the
pathetic
*NL*
patience
that
had
wrung
their
hearts
so
long
,
and
feeling
,
with
reverent
*NL*
joy
,
that
to
their
darling
death
was
a
benignant
angel
,
not
a
phantom
*NL*
full
of
dread
.

When
morning
came
,
for
the
first
time
in
many
months
the
fire
was
out
,
*NL*
Jo
's
place
was
empty
,
and
the
room
was
very
still
.
But
a
bird
sang
*NL*
blithely
on
a
budding
bough
,
close
by
,
the
snow-drops
blossomed
freshly
*NL*
at
the
window
,
and
the
spring
sunshine
streamed
in
like
a
benediction
*NL*
over
the
placid
face
upon
the
pillow
,
--
a
face
so
full
of
painless
peace
*NL*
that
those
who
loved
it
best
smiled
through
their
tears
,
and
thanked
God
*NL*
that
Beth
was
well
at
last
.

LEARNING
TO
FORGET
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
's
lecture
did
Laurie
good
,
though
,
of
course
,
he
did
not
own
it
till
*NL*
long
afterward
;
men
seldom
do
,
for
when
women
are
the
advisers
,
the
*NL*
lords
of
creation
do
n't
take
the
advice
till
they
have
persuaded
*NL*
themselves
that
it
is
just
what
they
intended
to
do
;
then
they
act
upon
*NL*
it
,
and
,
if
it
succeeds
,
they
give
the
weaker
vessel
half
the
credit
of
*NL*
it
;
if
it
fails
,
they
generously
give
her
the
whole
.
Laurie
went
back
to
*NL*
his
grandfather
,
and
was
so
dutifully
devoted
for
several
weeks
that
the
*NL*
old
gentleman
declared
the
climate
of
Nice
had
improved
him
wonderfully
,
*NL*
and
he
had
better
try
it
again
.
There
was
nothing
the
young
gentleman
*NL*
would
have
liked
better
,
but
elephants
could
not
have
dragged
him
back
*NL*
after
the
scolding
he
had
received
;
pride
forbid
,
and
whenever
the
*NL*
longing
grew
very
strong
,
he
fortified
his
resolution
by
repeating
the
*NL*
words
that
had
made
the
deepest
impression
,
``
I
despise
you
;
''
``
Go
and
do
*NL*
something
splendid
that
will
_
make
_
her
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
turned
the
matter
over
in
his
mind
so
often
that
he
soon
brought
*NL*
himself
to
confess
that
he
_
had
_
been
selfish
and
lazy
;
but
then
when
a
*NL*
man
has
a
great
sorrow
,
he
should
be
indulged
in
all
sorts
of
vagaries
*NL*
till
he
has
lived
it
down
.
He
felt
that
his
blighted
affections
were
*NL*
quite
dead
now
;
and
,
though
he
should
never
cease
to
be
a
faithful
*NL*
mourner
,
there
was
no
occasion
to
wear
his
weeds
ostentatiously
.
Jo
*NL*
_
would
n't
_
love
him
,
but
he
might
_
make
_
her
respect
and
admire
him
by
*NL*
doing
something
which
should
prove
that
a
girl
's
``
No
''
had
not
spoilt
his
*NL*
life
.
He
had
always
meant
to
do
something
,
and
Amy
's
advice
was
quite
*NL*
unnecessary
.
He
had
only
been
waiting
till
the
aforesaid
blighted
*NL*
affections
were
decently
interred
;
that
being
done
,
he
felt
that
he
was
*NL*
ready
to
``
hide
his
stricken
heart
,
and
still
toil
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Goethe
,
when
he
had
a
joy
or
a
grief
,
put
it
into
a
song
,
so
Laurie
*NL*
resolved
to
embalm
his
love-sorrow
in
music
,
and
compose
a
Requiem
which
*NL*
should
harrow
up
Jo
's
soul
and
melt
the
heart
of
every
hearer
.
Therefore
*NL*
the
next
time
the
old
gentleman
found
him
getting
restless
and
moody
,
*NL*
and
ordered
him
off
,
he
went
to
Vienna
,
where
he
had
musical
friends
,
*NL*
and
fell
to
work
with
the
firm
determination
to
distinguish
himself
.
*NL*
But
,
whether
the
sorrow
was
too
vast
to
be
embodied
in
music
,
or
music
*NL*
too
ethereal
to
uplift
a
mortal
woe
,
he
soon
discovered
that
the
Requiem
*NL*
was
beyond
him
,
just
at
present
.
It
was
evident
that
his
mind
was
not
in
*NL*
working
order
yet
,
and
his
ideas
needed
clarifying
;
for
often
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
plaintive
strain
,
he
would
find
himself
humming
a
dancing
*NL*
tune
that
vividly
recalled
the
Christmas
ball
at
Nice
,
especially
the
*NL*
stout
Frenchman
,
and
put
an
effectual
stop
to
tragic
composition
for
the
*NL*
time
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
tried
an
Opera
,
for
nothing
seemed
impossible
in
the
beginning
;
*NL*
but
here
,
again
,
unforeseen
difficulties
beset
him
.
He
wanted
Jo
for
his
*NL*
heroine
,
and
called
upon
his
memory
to
supply
him
with
tender
*NL*
recollections
and
romantic
visions
of
his
love
.
But
memory
turned
*NL*
traitor
;
and
,
as
if
possessed
by
the
perverse
spirit
of
the
girl
,
would
*NL*
only
recall
Jo
's
oddities
,
faults
,
and
freaks
,
would
only
show
her
in
*NL*
the
most
unsentimental
aspects
,
--
beating
mats
with
her
head
tied
up
in
*NL*
a
bandanna
,
barricading
herself
with
the
sofa-pillow
,
or
throwing
cold
*NL*
water
over
his
passion
_
a
la
_
Gummidge
,
--
and
an
irresistible
laugh
*NL*
spoilt
the
pensive
picture
he
was
endeavoring
to
paint
.
Jo
would
n't
be
*NL*
put
into
the
Opera
at
any
price
,
and
he
had
to
give
her
up
with
a
``
Bless
*NL*
that
girl
,
what
a
torment
she
is
!
''
and
a
clutch
at
his
hair
,
as
became
a
*NL*
distracted
composer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
looked
about
him
for
another
and
a
less
intractable
damsel
to
*NL*
immortalize
in
melody
,
memory
produced
one
with
the
most
obliging
*NL*
readiness
.
This
phantom
wore
many
faces
,
but
it
always
had
golden
hair
,
*NL*
was
enveloped
in
a
diaphanous
cloud
,
and
floated
airily
before
his
*NL*
mind
's
eye
in
a
pleasing
chaos
of
roses
,
peacocks
,
white
ponies
,
and
*NL*
blue
ribbons
.
He
did
not
give
the
complacent
wraith
any
name
,
but
he
*NL*
took
her
for
his
heroine
,
and
grew
quite
fond
of
her
,
as
well
he
might
;
*NL*
for
he
gifted
her
with
every
gift
and
grace
under
the
sun
,
and
escorted
*NL*
her
,
unscathed
,
through
trials
which
would
have
annihilated
any
mortal
*NL*
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thanks
to
this
inspiration
,
he
got
on
swimmingly
for
a
time
,
but
*NL*
gradually
the
work
lost
its
charm
,
and
he
forgot
to
compose
,
while
he
*NL*
sat
musing
,
pen
in
hand
,
or
roamed
about
the
gay
city
to
get
new
ideas
*NL*
and
refresh
his
mind
,
which
seemed
to
be
in
a
somewhat
unsettled
state
*NL*
that
winter
.
He
did
not
do
much
,
but
he
thought
a
great
deal
and
was
*NL*
conscious
of
a
change
of
some
sort
going
on
in
spite
of
himself
.
``
It
's
*NL*
genius
simmering
,
perhaps
.
I
'll
let
it
simmer
,
and
see
what
comes
of
*NL*
it
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
secret
suspicion
,
all
the
while
,
that
it
was
n't
*NL*
genius
,
but
something
far
more
common
.
Whatever
it
was
,
it
simmered
to
*NL*
some
purpose
,
for
he
grew
more
and
more
discontented
with
his
desultory
*NL*
life
,
began
to
long
for
some
real
and
earnest
work
to
go
at
,
soul
and
*NL*
body
,
and
finally
came
to
the
wise
conclusion
that
every
one
who
loved
*NL*
music
was
not
a
composer
.
Returning
from
one
of
Mozart
's
grand
operas
,
*NL*
splendidly
performed
at
the
Royal
Theatre
,
he
looked
over
his
own
,
*NL*
played
a
few
of
the
best
parts
,
sat
staring
up
at
the
busts
of
*NL*
Mendelssohn
,
Beethoven
,
and
Bach
,
who
stared
benignly
back
again
;
then
*NL*
suddenly
he
tore
up
his
music-sheets
,
one
by
one
,
and
,
as
the
last
*NL*
fluttered
out
of
his
hand
,
he
said
soberly
to
himself
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
right
!
Talent
is
n't
genius
,
and
you
ca
n't
make
it
so
.
That
*NL*
music
has
taken
the
vanity
out
of
me
as
Rome
took
it
out
of
her
,
and
I
*NL*
wo
n't
be
a
humbug
any
longer
.
Now
what
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
seemed
a
hard
question
to
answer
,
and
Laurie
began
to
wish
he
had
*NL*
to
work
for
his
daily
bread
.
Now
,
if
ever
,
occurred
an
eligible
*NL*
opportunity
for
``
going
to
the
devil
,
''
as
he
once
forcibly
expressed
it
,
*NL*
for
he
had
plenty
of
money
and
nothing
to
do
,
and
Satan
is
proverbially
*NL*
fond
of
providing
employment
for
full
and
idle
hands
.
The
poor
fellow
*NL*
had
temptations
enough
from
without
and
from
within
,
but
he
withstood
*NL*
them
pretty
well
;
for
,
much
as
he
valued
liberty
,
he
valued
good
faith
*NL*
and
confidence
more
,
so
his
promise
to
his
grandfather
,
and
his
desire
*NL*
to
be
able
to
look
honestly
into
the
eyes
of
the
women
who
loved
him
,
*NL*
and
say
``
All
's
well
,
''
kept
him
safe
and
steady
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
likely
some
Mrs.
Grundy
will
observe
,
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
;
boys
*NL*
will
be
boys
,
young
men
must
sow
their
wild
oats
,
and
women
must
not
*NL*
expect
miracles
.
''
I
dare
say
_
you
_
do
n't
,
Mrs.
Grundy
,
but
it
's
true
*NL*
nevertheless
.
Women
work
a
good
many
miracles
,
and
I
have
a
persuasion
*NL*
that
they
may
perform
even
that
of
raising
the
standard
of
manhood
by
*NL*
refusing
to
echo
such
sayings
.
Let
the
boys
be
boys
,
the
longer
the
*NL*
better
,
and
let
the
young
men
sow
their
wild
oats
if
they
must
;
but
*NL*
mothers
,
sisters
,
and
friends
may
help
to
make
the
crop
a
small
one
,
and
*NL*
keep
many
tares
from
spoiling
the
harvest
,
by
believing
,
and
showing
*NL*
that
they
believe
,
in
the
possibility
of
loyalty
to
the
virtues
which
*NL*
make
men
manliest
in
good
women
's
eyes
.
If
it
_
is
_
a
feminine
delusion
,
*NL*
leave
us
to
enjoy
it
while
we
may
,
for
without
it
half
the
beauty
and
*NL*
the
romance
of
life
is
lost
,
and
sorrowful
forebodings
would
embitter
*NL*
all
our
hopes
of
the
brave
,
tender-hearted
little
lads
,
who
still
love
*NL*
their
mothers
better
than
themselves
,
and
are
not
ashamed
to
own
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
thought
that
the
task
of
forgetting
his
love
for
Jo
would
absorb
*NL*
all
his
powers
for
years
;
but
,
to
his
great
surprise
,
he
discovered
it
*NL*
grew
easier
every
day
.
He
refused
to
believe
it
at
first
,
got
angry
with
*NL*
himself
,
and
could
n't
understand
it
;
but
these
hearts
of
ours
are
*NL*
curious
and
contrary
things
,
and
time
and
nature
work
their
will
in
*NL*
spite
of
us
.
Laurie
's
heart
_
would
n't
_
ache
;
the
wound
persisted
in
*NL*
healing
with
a
rapidity
that
astonished
him
,
and
,
instead
of
trying
to
*NL*
forget
,
he
found
himself
trying
to
remember
.
He
had
not
foreseen
this
*NL*
turn
of
affairs
,
and
was
not
prepared
for
it
.
He
was
disgusted
with
*NL*
himself
,
surprised
at
his
own
fickleness
,
and
full
of
a
queer
mixture
of
*NL*
disappointment
and
relief
that
he
could
recover
from
such
a
tremendous
*NL*
blow
so
soon
.
He
carefully
stirred
up
the
embers
of
his
lost
love
,
but
*NL*
they
refused
to
burst
into
a
blaze
:
there
was
only
a
comfortable
glow
*NL*
that
warmed
and
did
him
good
without
putting
him
into
a
fever
,
and
he
*NL*
was
reluctantly
obliged
to
confess
that
the
boyish
passion
was
slowly
*NL*
subsiding
into
a
more
tranquil
sentiment
,
very
tender
,
a
little
sad
and
*NL*
resentful
still
,
but
that
was
sure
to
pass
away
in
time
,
leaving
a
*NL*
brotherly
affection
which
would
last
unbroken
to
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
word
``
brotherly
''
passed
through
his
mind
in
one
of
these
*NL*
reveries
,
he
smiled
,
and
glanced
up
at
the
picture
of
Mozart
that
was
*NL*
before
him
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
he
was
a
great
man
;
and
when
he
could
n't
have
one
sister
he
took
*NL*
the
other
,
and
was
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
did
not
utter
the
words
,
but
he
thought
them
;
and
the
next
*NL*
instant
kissed
the
little
old
ring
,
saying
to
himself
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
!
I
have
n't
forgotten
,
I
never
can
.
I
'll
try
again
,
and
if
*NL*
that
fails
,
why
,
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
his
sentence
unfinished
,
he
seized
pen
and
paper
and
wrote
to
*NL*
Jo
,
telling
her
that
he
could
not
settle
to
anything
while
there
was
the
*NL*
least
hope
of
her
changing
her
mind
.
Could
n't
she
,
would
n't
she
,
and
let
*NL*
him
come
home
and
be
happy
?
While
waiting
for
an
answer
he
did
nothing
,
*NL*
but
he
did
it
energetically
,
for
he
was
in
a
fever
of
impatience
.
It
*NL*
came
at
last
,
and
settled
his
mind
effectually
on
one
point
,
for
Jo
*NL*
decidedly
could
n't
and
would
n't
.
She
was
wrapped
up
in
Beth
,
and
never
*NL*
wished
to
hear
the
word
``
love
''
again
.
Then
she
begged
him
to
be
happy
*NL*
with
somebody
else
,
but
always
to
keep
a
little
corner
of
his
heart
for
*NL*
his
loving
sister
Jo
.
In
a
postscript
she
desired
him
not
to
tell
Amy
*NL*
that
Beth
was
worse
;
she
was
coming
home
in
the
spring
,
and
there
was
no
*NL*
need
of
saddening
the
remainder
of
her
stay
.
That
would
be
time
enough
,
*NL*
please
God
,
but
Laurie
must
write
to
her
often
,
and
not
let
her
feel
*NL*
lonely
,
homesick
,
or
anxious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
will
,
at
once
.
Poor
little
girl
;
it
will
be
a
sad
going
home
for
*NL*
her
,
I
'm
afraid
;
''
and
Laurie
opened
his
desk
,
as
if
writing
to
Amy
had
*NL*
been
the
proper
conclusion
of
the
sentence
left
unfinished
some
weeks
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
did
not
write
the
letter
that
day
;
for
,
as
he
rummaged
out
his
*NL*
best
paper
,
he
came
across
something
which
changed
his
purpose
.
Tumbling
*NL*
about
in
one
part
of
the
desk
,
among
bills
,
passports
,
and
business
*NL*
documents
of
various
kinds
,
were
several
of
Jo
's
letters
,
and
in
another
*NL*
compartment
were
three
notes
from
Amy
,
carefully
tied
up
with
one
of
her
*NL*
blue
ribbons
,
and
sweetly
suggestive
of
the
little
dead
roses
put
away
*NL*
inside
.
With
a
half-repentant
,
half-amused
expression
,
Laurie
gathered
*NL*
up
all
Jo
's
letters
,
smoothed
,
folded
,
and
put
them
neatly
into
a
small
*NL*
drawer
of
the
desk
,
stood
a
minute
turning
the
ring
thoughtfully
on
his
*NL*
finger
,
then
slowly
drew
it
off
,
laid
it
with
the
letters
,
locked
the
*NL*
drawer
,
and
went
out
to
hear
High
Mass
at
Saint
Stefan
's
,
feeling
as
if
*NL*
there
had
been
a
funeral
;
and
,
though
not
overwhelmed
with
affliction
,
*NL*
this
seemed
a
more
proper
way
to
spend
the
rest
of
the
day
than
in
*NL*
writing
letters
to
charming
young
ladies
.

The
letter
went
very
soon
,
however
,
and
was
promptly
answered
,
for
Amy
*NL*
_
was
_
homesick
,
and
confessed
it
in
the
most
delightfully
confiding
*NL*
manner
.
The
correspondence
flourished
famously
,
and
letters
flew
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
with
unfailing
regularity
,
all
through
the
early
spring
.
Laurie
*NL*
sold
his
busts
,
made
allumettes
of
his
opera
,
and
went
back
to
Paris
,
*NL*
hoping
somebody
would
arrive
before
long
.
He
wanted
desperately
to
go
to
*NL*
Nice
,
but
would
not
till
he
was
asked
;
and
Amy
would
not
ask
him
,
for
*NL*
just
then
she
was
having
little
experiences
of
her
own
,
which
made
her
*NL*
rather
wish
to
avoid
the
quizzical
eyes
of
``
our
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fred
Vaughn
had
returned
,
and
put
the
question
to
which
she
had
once
*NL*
decided
to
answer
``
Yes
,
thank
you
;
''
but
now
she
said
,
``
No
,
thank
you
,
''
*NL*
kindly
but
steadily
;
for
,
when
the
time
came
,
her
courage
failed
her
,
*NL*
and
she
found
that
something
more
than
money
and
position
was
needed
to
*NL*
satisfy
the
new
longing
that
filled
her
heart
so
full
of
tender
hopes
*NL*
and
fears
.
The
words
,
``
Fred
is
a
good
fellow
,
but
not
at
all
the
man
I
*NL*
fancied
you
would
ever
like
,
''
and
Laurie
's
face
when
he
uttered
them
,
*NL*
kept
returning
to
her
as
pertinaciously
as
her
own
did
when
she
said
in
*NL*
look
,
if
not
in
words
,
``
I
shall
marry
for
money
.
''
It
troubled
her
to
*NL*
remember
that
now
,
she
wished
she
could
take
it
back
,
it
sounded
so
*NL*
unwomanly
.
She
did
n't
want
Laurie
to
think
her
a
heartless
,
worldly
*NL*
creature
;
she
did
n't
care
to
be
a
queen
of
society
now
half
so
much
as
*NL*
she
did
to
be
a
lovable
woman
;
she
was
so
glad
he
did
n't
hate
her
for
*NL*
the
dreadful
things
she
said
,
but
took
them
so
beautifully
,
and
was
*NL*
kinder
than
ever
.
His
letters
were
such
a
comfort
,
for
the
home
letters
*NL*
were
very
irregular
,
and
were
not
half
so
satisfactory
as
his
when
they
*NL*
did
come
.
It
was
not
only
a
pleasure
,
but
a
duty
to
answer
them
,
for
the
*NL*
poor
fellow
was
forlorn
,
and
needed
petting
,
since
Jo
persisted
in
being
*NL*
stony-hearted
.
She
ought
to
have
made
an
effort
,
and
tried
to
love
him
;
*NL*
it
could
n't
be
very
hard
,
many
people
would
be
proud
and
glad
to
have
*NL*
such
a
dear
boy
care
for
them
;
but
Jo
never
would
act
like
other
girls
,
*NL*
so
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
be
very
kind
,
and
treat
him
like
a
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
all
brothers
were
treated
as
well
as
Laurie
was
at
this
period
,
they
*NL*
would
be
a
much
happier
race
of
beings
than
they
are
.
Amy
never
lectured
*NL*
now
;
she
asked
his
opinion
on
all
subjects
;
she
was
interested
in
*NL*
everything
he
did
,
made
charming
little
presents
for
him
,
and
sent
him
*NL*
two
letters
a
week
,
full
of
lively
gossip
,
sisterly
confidences
,
and
*NL*
captivating
sketches
of
the
lovely
scenes
about
her
.
As
few
brothers
are
*NL*
complimented
by
having
their
letters
carried
about
in
their
sisters
'
*NL*
pockets
,
read
and
reread
diligently
,
cried
over
when
short
,
kissed
when
*NL*
long
,
and
treasured
carefully
,
we
will
not
hint
that
Amy
did
any
of
*NL*
these
fond
and
foolish
things
.
But
she
certainly
did
grow
a
little
pale
*NL*
and
pensive
that
spring
,
lost
much
of
her
relish
for
society
,
and
went
*NL*
out
sketching
alone
a
good
deal
.
She
never
had
much
to
show
when
she
*NL*
came
home
,
but
was
studying
nature
,
I
dare
say
,
while
she
sat
for
hours
,
*NL*
with
her
hands
folded
,
on
the
terrace
at
Valrosa
,
or
absently
sketched
*NL*
any
fancy
that
occurred
to
her
,
--
a
stalwart
knight
carved
on
a
tomb
,
a
*NL*
young
man
asleep
in
the
grass
,
with
his
hat
over
his
eyes
,
or
a
*NL*
curly-haired
girl
in
gorgeous
array
,
promenading
down
a
ball-room
on
the
*NL*
arm
of
a
tall
gentleman
,
both
faces
being
left
a
blur
according
to
the
*NL*
last
fashion
in
art
,
which
was
safe
,
but
not
altogether
satisfactory
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
aunt
thought
that
she
regretted
her
answer
to
Fred
;
and
,
finding
*NL*
denials
useless
and
explanations
impossible
,
Amy
left
her
to
think
what
*NL*
she
liked
,
taking
care
that
Laurie
should
know
that
Fred
had
gone
to
*NL*
Egypt
.
That
was
all
,
but
he
understood
it
,
and
looked
relieved
,
as
he
*NL*
said
to
himself
,
with
a
venerable
air
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
she
would
think
better
of
it
.
Poor
old
fellow
!
I
've
been
*NL*
through
it
all
,
and
I
can
sympathize
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
he
heaved
a
great
sigh
,
and
then
,
as
if
he
had
discharged
his
*NL*
duty
to
the
past
,
put
his
feet
up
on
the
sofa
,
and
enjoyed
Amy
's
letter
*NL*
luxuriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
these
changes
were
going
on
abroad
,
trouble
had
come
at
home
;
but
*NL*
the
letter
telling
that
Beth
was
failing
never
reached
Amy
,
and
when
the
*NL*
next
found
her
,
the
grass
was
green
above
her
sister
.
The
sad
news
met
*NL*
her
at
Vevay
,
for
the
heat
had
driven
them
from
Nice
in
May
,
and
they
*NL*
had
travelled
slowly
to
Switzerland
,
by
way
of
Genoa
and
the
Italian
*NL*
lakes
.
She
bore
it
very
well
,
and
quietly
submitted
to
the
family
decree
*NL*
that
she
should
not
shorten
her
visit
,
for
,
since
it
was
too
late
to
say
*NL*
good-by
to
Beth
,
she
had
better
stay
,
and
let
absence
soften
her
sorrow
.
*NL*
But
her
heart
was
very
heavy
;
she
longed
to
be
at
home
,
and
every
day
*NL*
looked
wistfully
across
the
lake
,
waiting
for
Laurie
to
come
and
comfort
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
come
very
soon
;
for
the
same
mail
brought
letters
to
them
both
,
*NL*
but
he
was
in
Germany
,
and
it
took
some
days
to
reach
him
.
The
moment
he
*NL*
read
it
,
he
packed
his
knapsack
,
bade
adieu
to
his
fellow-pedestrians
,
*NL*
and
was
off
to
keep
his
promise
,
with
a
heart
full
of
joy
and
sorrow
,
*NL*
hope
and
suspense
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
knew
Vevay
well
;
and
as
soon
as
the
boat
touched
the
little
quay
,
he
*NL*
hurried
along
the
shore
to
La
Tour
,
where
the
Carrols
were
living
_
en
*NL*
pension
_
.
The
_
garcon
_
was
in
despair
that
the
whole
family
had
gone
to
*NL*
take
a
promenade
on
the
lake
;
but
no
,
the
blond
mademoiselle
might
be
in
*NL*
the
chateau
garden
.
If
monsieur
would
give
himself
the
pain
of
sitting
*NL*
down
,
a
flash
of
time
should
present
her
.
But
monsieur
could
not
wait
*NL*
even
``
a
flash
of
time
,
''
and
,
in
the
middle
of
the
speech
,
departed
to
*NL*
find
mademoiselle
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
pleasant
old
garden
on
the
borders
of
the
lovely
lake
,
with
chestnuts
*NL*
rustling
overhead
,
ivy
climbing
everywhere
,
and
the
black
shadow
of
the
*NL*
tower
falling
far
across
the
sunny
water
.
At
one
corner
of
the
wide
,
low
*NL*
wall
was
a
seat
,
and
here
Amy
often
came
to
read
or
work
,
or
console
*NL*
herself
with
the
beauty
all
about
her
.
She
was
sitting
here
that
day
,
*NL*
leaning
her
head
on
her
hand
,
with
a
homesick
heart
and
heavy
eyes
,
*NL*
thinking
of
Beth
,
and
wondering
why
Laurie
did
not
come
.
She
did
not
*NL*
hear
him
cross
the
court-yard
beyond
,
nor
see
him
pause
in
the
archway
*NL*
that
led
from
the
subterranean
path
into
the
garden
.
He
stood
a
minute
,
*NL*
looking
at
her
with
new
eyes
,
seeing
what
no
one
had
ever
seen
*NL*
before
,
--
the
tender
side
of
Amy
's
character
.
Everything
about
her
mutely
*NL*
suggested
love
and
sorrow
,
--
the
blotted
letters
in
her
lap
,
the
black
*NL*
ribbon
that
tied
up
her
hair
,
the
womanly
pain
and
patience
in
her
face
;
*NL*
even
the
little
ebony
cross
at
her
throat
seemed
pathetic
to
Laurie
,
for
*NL*
he
had
given
it
to
her
,
and
she
wore
it
as
her
only
ornament
.
If
he
had
*NL*
any
doubts
about
the
reception
she
would
give
him
,
they
were
set
at
*NL*
rest
the
minute
she
looked
up
and
saw
him
;
for
,
dropping
everything
,
she
*NL*
ran
to
him
,
exclaiming
,
in
a
tone
of
unmistakable
love
and
longing
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Laurie
,
Laurie
,
I
knew
you
'd
come
to
me
!

O
Laurie
,
Laurie
,
I
knew
you
'd
come
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
everything
was
said
and
settled
then
;
for
,
as
they
stood
*NL*
together
quite
silent
for
a
moment
,
with
the
dark
head
bent
down
*NL*
protectingly
over
the
light
one
,
Amy
felt
that
no
one
could
comfort
and
*NL*
sustain
her
so
well
as
Laurie
,
and
Laurie
decided
that
Amy
was
the
only
*NL*
woman
in
the
world
who
could
fill
Jo
's
place
,
and
make
him
happy
.
He
did
*NL*
not
tell
her
so
;
but
she
was
not
disappointed
,
for
both
felt
the
truth
,
*NL*
were
satisfied
,
and
gladly
left
the
rest
to
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
minute
Amy
went
back
to
her
place
;
and
,
while
she
dried
her
tears
,
*NL*
Laurie
gathered
up
the
scattered
papers
,
finding
in
the
sight
of
sundry
*NL*
well-worn
letters
and
suggestive
sketches
good
omens
for
the
future
.
As
*NL*
he
sat
down
beside
her
,
Amy
felt
shy
again
,
and
turned
rosy
red
at
the
*NL*
recollection
of
her
impulsive
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
n't
help
it
;
I
felt
so
lonely
and
sad
,
and
was
so
very
glad
to
*NL*
see
you
.
It
was
such
a
surprise
to
look
up
and
find
you
,
just
as
I
was
*NL*
beginning
to
fear
you
would
n't
come
,
''
she
said
,
trying
in
vain
to
speak
*NL*
quite
naturally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
came
the
minute
I
heard
.
I
wish
I
could
say
something
to
comfort
you
*NL*
for
the
loss
of
dear
little
Beth
;
but
I
can
only
feel
,
and
--
''
He
could
*NL*
not
get
any
further
,
for
he
,
too
,
turned
bashful
all
of
a
sudden
,
and
*NL*
did
not
quite
know
what
to
say
.
He
longed
to
lay
Amy
's
head
down
on
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
tell
her
to
have
a
good
cry
,
but
he
did
not
dare
;
so
took
*NL*
her
hand
instead
,
and
gave
it
a
sympathetic
squeeze
that
was
better
than
*NL*
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
n't
say
anything
;
this
comforts
me
,
''
she
said
softly
.
``
Beth
is
*NL*
well
and
happy
,
and
I
must
n't
wish
her
back
;
but
I
dread
the
going
home
,
*NL*
much
as
I
long
to
see
them
all
.
We
wo
n't
talk
about
it
now
,
for
it
makes
*NL*
me
cry
,
and
I
want
to
enjoy
you
while
you
stay
.
You
need
n't
go
right
*NL*
back

need
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
if
you
want
me
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
so
much

Aunt
and
Flo
are
very
kind
;
but
you
seem
like
one
of
the
*NL*
family
,
and
it
would
be
so
comfortable
to
have
you
for
a
little
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Amy
spoke
and
looked
so
like
a
homesick
child
,
whose
heart
was
full
,
*NL*
that
Laurie
forgot
his
bashfulness
all
at
once
,
and
gave
her
just
what
*NL*
she
wanted
,
--
the
petting
she
was
used
to
and
the
cheerful
conversation
*NL*
she
needed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
little
soul
,
you
look
as
if
you
'd
grieved
yourself
half-sick
!
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
take
care
of
you
,
so
do
n't
cry
any
more
,
but
come
and
walk
*NL*
about
with
me
;
the
wind
is
too
chilly
for
you
to
sit
still
,
''
he
said
,
in
*NL*
the
half-caressing
,
half-commanding
way
that
Amy
liked
,
as
he
tied
on
*NL*
her
hat
,
drew
her
arm
through
his
,
and
began
to
pace
up
and
down
the
*NL*
sunny
walk
,
under
the
new-leaved
chestnuts
.
He
felt
more
at
ease
upon
*NL*
his
legs
;
and
Amy
found
it
very
pleasant
to
have
a
strong
arm
to
lean
*NL*
upon
,
a
familiar
face
to
smile
at
her
,
and
a
kind
voice
to
talk
*NL*
delightfully
for
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quaint
old
garden
had
sheltered
many
pairs
of
lovers
,
and
seemed
*NL*
expressly
made
for
them
,
so
sunny
and
secluded
was
it
,
with
nothing
but
*NL*
the
tower
to
overlook
them
,
and
the
wide
lake
to
carry
away
the
echo
of
*NL*
their
words
,
as
it
rippled
by
below
.
For
an
hour
this
new
pair
walked
*NL*
and
talked
,
or
rested
on
the
wall
,
enjoying
the
sweet
influences
which
*NL*
gave
such
a
charm
to
time
and
place
;
and
when
an
unromantic
dinner-bell
*NL*
warned
them
away
,
Amy
felt
as
if
she
left
her
burden
of
loneliness
and
*NL*
sorrow
behind
her
in
the
chateau
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
Mrs.
Carrol
saw
the
girl
's
altered
face
,
she
was
illuminated
*NL*
with
a
new
idea
,
and
exclaimed
to
herself
,
``
Now
I
understand
it
*NL*
all
,
--
the
child
has
been
pining
for
young
Laurence
.
Bless
my
heart
,
I
*NL*
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
praiseworthy
discretion
,
the
good
lady
said
nothing
,
and
betrayed
*NL*
no
sign
of
enlightenment
;
but
cordially
urged
Laurie
to
stay
,
and
begged
*NL*
Amy
to
enjoy
his
society
,
for
it
would
do
her
more
good
than
so
much
*NL*
solitude
.
Amy
was
a
model
of
docility
;
and
,
as
her
aunt
was
a
good
deal
*NL*
occupied
with
Flo
,
she
was
left
to
entertain
her
friend
,
and
did
it
with
*NL*
more
than
her
usual
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
Nice
,
Laurie
had
lounged
and
Amy
had
scolded
;
at
Vevay
,
Laurie
was
*NL*
never
idle
,
but
always
walking
,
riding
,
boating
,
or
studying
,
in
the
*NL*
most
energetic
manner
,
while
Amy
admired
everything
he
did
,
and
followed
*NL*
his
example
as
far
and
as
fast
as
she
could
.
He
said
the
change
was
*NL*
owing
to
the
climate
,
and
she
did
not
contradict
him
,
being
glad
of
a
*NL*
like
excuse
for
her
own
recovered
health
and
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
invigorating
air
did
them
both
good
,
and
much
exercise
worked
*NL*
wholesome
changes
in
minds
as
well
as
bodies
.
They
seemed
to
get
clearer
*NL*
views
of
life
and
duty
up
there
among
the
everlasting
hills
;
the
fresh
*NL*
winds
blew
away
desponding
doubts
,
delusive
fancies
,
and
moody
mists
;
*NL*
the
warm
spring
sunshine
brought
out
all
sorts
of
aspiring
ideas
,
tender
*NL*
hopes
,
and
happy
thoughts
;
the
lake
seemed
to
wash
away
the
troubles
of
*NL*
the
past
,
and
the
grand
old
mountains
to
look
benignly
down
upon
them
,
*NL*
saying
,
``
Little
children
,
love
one
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
the
new
sorrow
,
it
was
a
very
happy
time
,
so
happy
that
*NL*
Laurie
could
not
bear
to
disturb
it
by
a
word
.
It
took
him
a
little
*NL*
while
to
recover
from
his
surprise
at
the
rapid
cure
of
his
first
,
and
,
*NL*
as
he
had
firmly
believed
,
his
last
and
only
love
.
He
consoled
himself
*NL*
for
the
seeming
disloyalty
by
the
thought
that
Jo
's
sister
was
almost
*NL*
the
same
as
Jo
's
self
,
and
the
conviction
that
it
would
have
been
*NL*
impossible
to
love
any
other
woman
but
Amy
so
soon
and
so
well
.
His
*NL*
first
wooing
had
been
of
the
tempestuous
order
,
and
he
looked
back
upon
*NL*
it
as
if
through
a
long
vista
of
years
,
with
a
feeling
of
compassion
*NL*
blended
with
regret
.
He
was
not
ashamed
of
it
,
but
put
it
away
as
one
of
*NL*
the
bitter-sweet
experiences
of
his
life
,
for
which
he
could
be
grateful
*NL*
when
the
pain
was
over
.
His
second
wooing
he
resolved
should
be
as
calm
*NL*
and
simple
as
possible
;
there
was
no
need
of
having
a
scene
,
hardly
any
*NL*
need
of
telling
Amy
that
he
loved
her
;
she
knew
it
without
words
,
and
*NL*
had
given
him
his
answer
long
ago
.
It
all
came
about
so
naturally
that
*NL*
no
one
could
complain
,
and
he
knew
that
everybody
would
be
pleased
,
even
*NL*
Jo
.
But
when
our
first
little
passion
has
been
crushed
,
we
are
apt
to
be
*NL*
wary
and
slow
in
making
a
second
trial
;
so
Laurie
let
the
days
pass
,
*NL*
enjoying
every
hour
,
and
leaving
to
chance
the
utterance
of
the
word
*NL*
that
would
put
an
end
to
the
first
and
sweetest
part
of
his
new
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
rather
imagined
that
the
_
denouement
_
would
take
place
in
the
*NL*
chateau
garden
by
moonlight
,
and
in
the
most
graceful
and
decorous
*NL*
manner
;
but
it
turned
out
exactly
the
reverse
,
for
the
matter
was
*NL*
settled
on
the
lake
,
at
noonday
,
in
a
few
blunt
words
.
They
had
been
*NL*
floating
about
all
the
morning
,
from
gloomy
St.
Gingolf
to
sunny
*NL*
Montreux
,
with
the
Alps
of
Savoy
on
one
side
,
Mont
St.
Bernard
and
the
*NL*
Dent
du
Midi
on
the
other
,
pretty
Vevay
in
the
valley
,
and
Lausanne
upon
*NL*
the
hill
beyond
,
a
cloudless
blue
sky
overhead
,
and
the
bluer
lake
*NL*
below
,
dotted
with
the
picturesque
boats
that
look
like
white-winged
*NL*
gulls
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
talking
of
Bonnivard
,
as
they
glided
past
Chillon
,
and
of
*NL*
Rousseau
,
as
they
looked
up
at
Clarens
,
where
he
wrote
his
``
Heloise
.
''
*NL*
Neither
had
read
it
,
but
they
knew
it
was
a
love-story
,
and
each
*NL*
privately
wondered
if
it
was
half
as
interesting
as
their
own
.
Amy
had
*NL*
been
dabbling
her
hand
in
the
water
during
the
little
pause
that
fell
*NL*
between
them
,
and
,
when
she
looked
up
,
Laurie
was
leaning
on
his
oars
,
*NL*
with
an
expression
in
his
eyes
that
made
her
say
hastily
,
merely
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
saying
something
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
be
tired
;
rest
a
little
,
and
let
me
row
:
it
will
do
me
good
;
*NL*
for
,
since
you
came
,
I
have
been
altogether
lazy
and
luxurious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
tired
;
but
you
may
take
an
oar
,
if
you
like
.
There
's
room
*NL*
enough
,
though
I
have
to
sit
nearly
in
the
middle
,
else
the
boat
wo
n't
*NL*
trim
,
''
returned
Laurie
,
as
if
he
rather
liked
the
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
that
she
had
not
mended
matters
much
,
Amy
took
the
offered
third
*NL*
of
a
seat
,
shook
her
hair
over
her
face
,
and
accepted
an
oar
.
She
rowed
*NL*
as
well
as
she
did
many
other
things
;
and
,
though
she
used
both
hands
,
*NL*
and
Laurie
but
one
,
the
oars
kept
time
,
and
the
boat
went
smoothly
*NL*
through
the
water
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
well
we
pull
together
,
do
n't
we
?
''
said
Amy
,
who
objected
to
silence
*NL*
just
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
well
that
I
wish
we
might
always
pull
in
the
same
boat
.
Will
you
,
*NL*
Amy
?
''
very
tenderly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Laurie
,
''
very
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
both
stopped
rowing
,
and
unconsciously
added
a
pretty
little
*NL*
_
tableau
_
of
human
love
and
happiness
to
the
dissolving
views
reflected
*NL*
in
the
lake
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
XLII
.
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
ALONE
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
easy
to
promise
self-abnegation
when
self
was
wrapped
up
in
*NL*
another
,
and
heart
and
soul
were
purified
by
a
sweet
example
;
but
when
*NL*
the
helpful
voice
was
silent
,
the
daily
lesson
over
,
the
beloved
*NL*
presence
gone
,
and
nothing
remained
but
loneliness
and
grief
,
then
Jo
*NL*
found
her
promise
very
hard
to
keep
.
How
could
she
``
comfort
father
and
*NL*
mother
,
''
when
her
own
heart
ached
with
a
ceaseless
longing
for
her
*NL*
sister
;
how
could
she
``
make
the
house
cheerful
,
''
when
all
its
light
and
*NL*
warmth
and
beauty
seemed
to
have
deserted
it
when
Beth
left
the
old
home
*NL*
for
the
new
;
and
where
in
all
the
world
could
she
``
find
some
useful
,
*NL*
happy
work
to
do
,
''
that
would
take
the
place
of
the
loving
service
which
*NL*
had
been
its
own
reward
?
She
tried
in
a
blind
,
hopeless
way
to
do
her
*NL*
duty
,
secretly
rebelling
against
it
all
the
while
,
for
it
seemed
unjust
*NL*
that
her
few
joys
should
be
lessened
,
her
burdens
made
heavier
,
and
life
*NL*
get
harder
and
harder
as
she
toiled
along
.
Some
people
seemed
to
get
all
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
some
all
shadow
;
it
was
not
fair
,
for
she
tried
more
than
*NL*
Amy
to
be
good
,
but
never
got
any
reward
,
only
disappointment
,
trouble
,
*NL*
and
hard
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Jo
,
these
were
dark
days
to
her
,
for
something
like
despair
came
*NL*
over
her
when
she
thought
of
spending
all
her
life
in
that
quiet
house
,
*NL*
devoted
to
humdrum
cares
,
a
few
small
pleasures
,
and
the
duty
that
never
*NL*
seemed
to
grow
any
easier
.
``
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
I
was
n't
meant
for
a
life
*NL*
like
this
,
and
I
know
I
shall
break
away
and
do
something
desperate
if
*NL*
somebody
do
n't
come
and
help
me
,
''
she
said
to
herself
,
when
her
first
*NL*
efforts
failed
,
and
she
fell
into
the
moody
,
miserable
state
of
mind
*NL*
which
often
comes
when
strong
wills
have
to
yield
to
the
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
some
one
did
come
and
help
her
,
though
Jo
did
not
recognize
her
good
*NL*
angels
at
once
,
because
they
wore
familiar
shapes
,
and
used
the
simple
*NL*
spells
best
fitted
to
poor
humanity
.
Often
she
started
up
at
night
,
*NL*
thinking
Beth
called
her
;
and
when
the
sight
of
the
little
empty
bed
*NL*
made
her
cry
with
the
bitter
cry
of
an
unsubmissive
sorrow
,
``
O
Beth
,
*NL*
come
back
!
come
back
!
''
she
did
not
stretch
out
her
yearning
arms
in
*NL*
vain
;
for
,
as
quick
to
hear
her
sobbing
as
she
had
been
to
hear
her
*NL*
sister
's
faintest
whisper
,
her
mother
came
to
comfort
her
,
not
with
*NL*
words
only
,
but
the
patient
tenderness
that
soothes
by
a
touch
,
tears
*NL*
that
were
mute
reminders
of
a
greater
grief
than
Jo
's
,
and
broken
*NL*
whispers
,
more
eloquent
than
prayers
,
because
hopeful
resignation
went
*NL*
hand-in-hand
with
natural
sorrow
.
Sacred
moments
,
when
heart
talked
to
*NL*
heart
in
the
silence
of
the
night
,
turning
affliction
to
a
blessing
,
*NL*
which
chastened
grief
and
strengthened
love
.
Feeling
this
,
Jo
's
burden
*NL*
seemed
easier
to
bear
,
duty
grew
sweeter
,
and
life
looked
more
*NL*
endurable
,
seen
from
the
safe
shelter
of
her
mother
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
aching
heart
was
a
little
comforted
,
troubled
mind
likewise
found
*NL*
help
;
for
one
day
she
went
to
the
study
,
and
,
leaning
over
the
good
gray
*NL*
head
lifted
to
welcome
her
with
a
tranquil
smile
,
she
said
,
very
*NL*
humbly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
talk
to
me
as
you
did
to
Beth
.
I
need
it
more
than
she
did
,
for
*NL*
I
'm
all
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
nothing
can
comfort
me
like
this
,
''
he
answered
,
with
a
falter
*NL*
in
his
voice
,
and
both
arms
round
her
,
as
if
he
,
too
,
needed
help
,
and
*NL*
did
not
fear
to
ask
it
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
Then
,
sitting
in
Beth
's
little
chair
close
beside
him
,
Jo
told
her
*NL*
troubles
,
--
the
resentful
sorrow
for
her
loss
,
the
fruitless
efforts
that
*NL*
discouraged
her
,
the
want
of
faith
that
made
life
look
so
dark
,
and
all
*NL*
the
sad
bewilderment
which
we
call
despair
.
She
gave
him
entire
*NL*
confidence
,
he
gave
her
the
help
she
needed
,
and
both
found
consolation
*NL*
in
the
act
;
for
the
time
had
come
when
they
could
talk
together
not
only
*NL*
as
father
and
daughter
,
but
as
man
and
woman
,
able
and
glad
to
serve
*NL*
each
other
with
mutual
sympathy
as
well
as
mutual
love
.
Happy
,
*NL*
thoughtful
times
there
in
the
old
study
which
Jo
called
``
the
church
of
*NL*
one
member
,
''
and
from
which
she
came
with
fresh
courage
,
recovered
*NL*
cheerfulness
,
and
a
more
submissive
spirit
;
for
the
parents
who
had
*NL*
taught
one
child
to
meet
death
without
fear
,
were
trying
now
to
teach
*NL*
another
to
accept
life
without
despondency
or
distrust
,
and
to
use
its
*NL*
beautiful
opportunities
with
gratitude
and
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
helps
had
Jo
,
--
humble
,
wholesome
duties
and
delights
that
would
*NL*
not
be
denied
their
part
in
serving
her
,
and
which
she
slowly
learned
to
*NL*
see
and
value
.
Brooms
and
dishcloths
never
could
be
as
distasteful
as
*NL*
they
once
had
been
,
for
Beth
had
presided
over
both
;
and
something
of
*NL*
her
housewifely
spirit
seemed
to
linger
round
the
little
mop
and
the
old
*NL*
brush
,
that
was
never
thrown
away
.
As
she
used
them
,
Jo
found
herself
*NL*
humming
the
songs
Beth
used
to
hum
,
imitating
Beth
's
orderly
ways
,
and
*NL*
giving
the
little
touches
here
and
there
that
kept
everything
fresh
and
*NL*
cosey
,
which
was
the
first
step
toward
making
home
happy
,
though
she
*NL*
did
n't
know
it
,
till
Hannah
said
with
an
approving
squeeze
of
the
*NL*
hand
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
thoughtful
creter
,
you
're
determined
we
sha
'n'
t
miss
that
dear
lamb
*NL*
ef
you
can
help
it
.
We
do
n't
say
much
,
but
we
see
it
,
and
the
Lord
will
*NL*
bless
you
for

,
see
ef
He
do
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
sat
sewing
together
,
Jo
discovered
how
much
improved
her
sister
*NL*
Meg
was
;
how
well
she
could
talk
,
how
much
she
knew
about
good
,
womanly
*NL*
impulses
,
thoughts
,
and
feelings
,
how
happy
she
was
in
husband
and
*NL*
children
,
and
how
much
they
were
all
doing
for
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marriage
is
an
excellent
thing
,
after
all
.
I
wonder
if
I
should
blossom
*NL*
out
half
as
well
as
you
have
,
if
I
tried
it
?
''
said
Jo
,
as
she
*NL*
constructed
a
kite
for
Demi
,
in
the
topsy-turvy
nursery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
just
what
you
need
to
bring
out
the
tender
,
womanly
half
of
your
*NL*
nature
,
Jo
.
You
are
like
a
chestnut-burr
,
prickly
outside
,
but
*NL*
silky-soft
within
,
and
a
sweet
kernel
,
if
one
can
only
get
at
it
.
Love
*NL*
will
make
you
show
your
heart
some
day
,
and
then
the
rough
burr
will
*NL*
fall
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frost
opens
chestnut-burrs
,
ma'am
,
and
it
takes
a
good
shake
to
bring
*NL*
them
down
.
Boys
go
nutting
,
and
I
do
n't
care
to
be
bagged
by
them
,
''
*NL*
returned
Jo
,
pasting
away
at
the
kite
which
no
wind
that
blows
would
*NL*
ever
carry
up
,
for
Daisy
had
tied
herself
on
as
a
bob
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
laughed
,
for
she
was
glad
to
see
a
glimmer
of
Jo
's
old
spirit
,
but
*NL*
she
felt
it
her
duty
to
enforce
her
opinion
by
every
argument
in
her
*NL*
power
;
and
the
sisterly
chats
were
not
wasted
,
especially
as
two
of
*NL*
Meg
's
most
effective
arguments
were
the
babies
,
whom
Jo
loved
tenderly
.
*NL*
Grief
is
the
best
opener
for
some
hearts
,
and
Jo
's
was
nearly
ready
for
*NL*
the
bag
:
a
little
more
sunshine
to
ripen
the
nut
,
then
,
not
a
boy
's
*NL*
impatient
shake
,
but
a
man
's
hand
reached
up
to
pick
it
gently
from
the
*NL*
burr
,
and
find
the
kernel
sound
and
sweet
.
If
she
had
suspected
this
,
*NL*
she
would
have
shut
up
tight
,
and
been
more
prickly
than
ever
;
*NL*
fortunately
she
was
n't
thinking
about
herself
,
so
,
when
the
time
came
,
*NL*
down
she
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
she
had
been
the
heroine
of
a
moral
story-book
,
she
ought
at
*NL*
this
period
of
her
life
to
have
become
quite
saintly
,
renounced
the
*NL*
world
,
and
gone
about
doing
good
in
a
mortified
bonnet
,
with
tracts
in
*NL*
her
pocket
.
But
,
you
see
,
Jo
was
n't
a
heroine
;
she
was
only
a
struggling
*NL*
human
girl
,
like
hundreds
of
others
,
and
she
just
acted
out
her
nature
,
*NL*
being
sad
,
cross
,
listless
,
or
energetic
,
as
the
mood
suggested
.
It
's
*NL*
highly
virtuous
to
say
we
'll
be
good
,
but
we
ca
n't
do
it
all
at
once
,
*NL*
and
it
takes
a
long
pull
,
a
strong
pull
,
and
a
pull
all
together
,
*NL*
before
some
of
us
even
get
our
feet
set
in
the
right
way
.
Jo
had
got
so
*NL*
far
,
she
was
learning
to
do
her
duty
,
and
to
feel
unhappy
if
she
did
*NL*
not
;
but
to
do
it
cheerfully
--
ah
,
that
was
another
thing
!
She
had
often
*NL*
said
she
wanted
to
do
something
splendid
,
no
matter
how
hard
;
and
now
*NL*
she
had
her
wish
,
for
what
could
be
more
beautiful
than
to
devote
her
*NL*
life
to
father
and
mother
,
trying
to
make
home
as
happy
to
them
as
they
*NL*
had
to
her
?
And
,
if
difficulties
were
necessary
to
increase
the
splendor
*NL*
of
the
effort
,
what
could
be
harder
for
a
restless
,
ambitious
girl
than
*NL*
to
give
up
her
own
hopes
,
plans
,
and
desires
,
and
cheerfully
live
for
*NL*
others
?
*NL*
*NL*
Providence
had
taken
her
at
her
word
;
here
was
the
task
,
not
what
she
*NL*
had
expected
,
but
better
,
because
self
had
no
part
in
it
:
now
,
could
she
*NL*
do
it
?
She
decided
that
she
would
try
;
and
,
in
her
first
attempt
,
she
*NL*
found
the
helps
I
have
suggested
.
Still
another
was
given
her
,
and
she
*NL*
took
it
,
not
as
a
reward
,
but
as
a
comfort
,
as
Christian
took
the
*NL*
refreshment
afforded
by
the
little
arbor
where
he
rested
,
as
he
climbed
*NL*
the
hill
called
Difficulty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
write
?
That
always
used
to
make
you
happy
,
''
said
her
*NL*
mother
,
once
,
when
the
desponding
fit
overshadowed
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
no
heart
to
write
,
and
if
I
had
,
nobody
cares
for
my
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
;
write
something
for
us
,
and
never
mind
the
rest
of
the
world
.
*NL*
Try
it
,
dear
;
I
'm
sure
it
would
do
you
good
,
and
please
us
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
believe
I
can
;
''
but
Jo
got
out
her
desk
,
and
began
to
overhaul
*NL*
her
half-finished
manuscripts
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
afterward
her
mother
peeped
in
,
and
there
she
was
,
scratching
*NL*
away
,
with
her
black
pinafore
on
,
and
an
absorbed
expression
,
which
*NL*
caused
Mrs.
March
to
smile
,
and
slip
away
,
well
pleased
with
the
success
*NL*
of
her
suggestion
.
Jo
never
knew
how
it
happened
,
but
something
got
into
*NL*
that
story
that
went
straight
to
the
hearts
of
those
who
read
it
;
for
,
*NL*
when
her
family
had
laughed
and
cried
over
it
,
her
father
sent
it
,
much
*NL*
against
her
will
,
to
one
of
the
popular
magazines
,
and
,
to
her
utter
*NL*
surprise
,
it
was
not
only
paid
for
,
but
others
requested
.
Letters
from
*NL*
several
persons
,
whose
praise
was
honor
,
followed
the
appearance
of
the
*NL*
little
story
,
newspapers
copied
it
,
and
strangers
as
well
as
friends
*NL*
admired
it
.
For
a
small
thing
it
was
a
great
success
;
and
Jo
was
more
*NL*
astonished
than
when
her
novel
was
commended
and
condemned
all
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
understand
it
.
What
_
can
_
there
be
in
a
simple
little
story
*NL*
like
that
,
to
make
people
praise
it
so
?
''
she
said
,
quite
bewildered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
truth
in
it
,
Jo
,
that
's
the
secret
;
humor
and
pathos
make
it
*NL*
alive
,
and
you
have
found
your
style
at
last
.
You
wrote
with
no
thought
*NL*
of
fame
or
money
,
and
put
your
heart
into
it
,
my
daughter
;
you
have
had
*NL*
the
bitter
,
now
comes
the
sweet
.
Do
your
best
,
and
grow
as
happy
as
we
*NL*
are
in
your
success
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
there
_
is
_
anything
good
or
true
in
what
I
write
,
it
is
n't
mine
;
I
*NL*
owe
it
all
to
you
and
mother
and
to
Beth
,
''
said
Jo
,
more
touched
by
her
*NL*
father
's
words
than
by
any
amount
of
praise
from
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
,
taught
by
love
and
sorrow
,
Jo
wrote
her
little
stories
,
and
sent
*NL*
them
away
to
make
friends
for
themselves
and
her
,
finding
it
a
very
*NL*
charitable
world
to
such
humble
wanderers
;
for
they
were
kindly
*NL*
welcomed
,
and
sent
home
comfortable
tokens
to
their
mother
,
like
dutiful
*NL*
children
whom
good
fortune
overtakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Amy
and
Laurie
wrote
of
their
engagement
,
Mrs.
March
feared
that
Jo
*NL*
would
find
it
difficult
to
rejoice
over
it
,
but
her
fears
were
soon
set
*NL*
at
rest
;
for
,
though
Jo
looked
grave
at
first
,
she
took
it
very
quietly
,
*NL*
and
was
full
of
hopes
and
plans
for
``
the
children
''
before
she
read
the
*NL*
letter
twice
.
It
was
a
sort
of
written
duet
,
wherein
each
glorified
the
*NL*
other
in
lover-like
fashion
,
very
pleasant
to
read
and
satisfactory
to
*NL*
think
of
,
for
no
one
had
any
objection
to
make
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
like
it
,
mother
?
''
said
Jo
,
as
they
laid
down
the
closely
written
*NL*
sheets
,
and
looked
at
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
hoped
it
would
be
so
,
ever
since
Amy
wrote
that
she
had
refused
*NL*
Fred

I
felt
sure
then
that
something
better
than
what
you
call
the
*NL*
`
mercenary
spirit
'
had
come
over
her
,
and
a
hint
here
and
there
in
her
*NL*
letters
made
me
suspect
that
love
and
Laurie
would
win
the
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sharp
you
are
,
Marmee
,
and
how
silent

You
never
said
a
word

me

*NL*
*NL*
``
Mothers
have
need
of
sharp
eyes

discreet

was
half
afraid
to
put
the
idea
into
your

should
write

congratulate
them
before
the
thing

settled

silly

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew

sincere

seeing
that
you
are
very
lonely

sometimes
there
is
a
hungry
look
in
your
eyes
that
goes
to
my
heart

thing

am

lonely

perhaps
if

I
might
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

''
and
Mrs.
March
smiled
her
wise
smile
,
as
Jo
turned
back
the
*NL*
leaves
to
read
what
Amy
said
of
Laurie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
beautiful
to
be
loved
as
Laurie
loves
me

he
is
n't
*NL*
sentimental

say
much
about
it
,
but
I
see
and
feel
it
in
all
he
*NL*
says
and
does
,
and
it
makes
me
so
happy
and
so
humble
that
I
do
n't
seem
*NL*
to
be
the
same
girl
I
was
.
I
never
knew
how
good
and
generous
and
tender
*NL*
he
was
till
now
,
for
he
lets
me
read
his
heart
,
and
I
find
it
full
of
*NL*
noble
impulses
and
hopes
and
purposes
,
and
am
so
proud
to
know
it
's
*NL*
mine
.
He
says
he
feels
as
if
he
`
could
make
a
prosperous
voyage
now
*NL*
with
me
aboard
as
mate
,
and
lots
of
love

I
pray
he
may
,

try
to
be
all

believes

I
love
my
gallant

all

my
heart

soul

might
,

never
will
desert
him
,
while
God
lets
*NL*
us
be
together

O
mother

I
never
knew
how
much
like
heaven
this
world

could
be

when
two
people
love
and
live
for
one
another

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that

our
cool

Truly

work
*NL*
miracles

How
very

very
happy
they
must
be

And
Jo
laid
the
rustling
*NL*
sheets
together
with
a
careful
hand
,
as
one
might
shut
the
covers
of
a
*NL*
lovely
romance
,
which
holds
the
reader
fast
till
the
end
comes
,
and
he
*NL*
finds
himself
alone
in
the
work-a-day
world
again

*NL*
*NL*
By
and
by
Jo
roamed
away
upstairs
,
for
it
was
rainy
,
and
she
could
not
*NL*
walk
.
A
restless
spirit
possessed
her
,
and
the
old
feeling
came
again
,
*NL*
not
bitter
as
it
once
was
,
but
a
sorrowfully
patient
wonder
why
one
*NL*
sister
should
have
all
she
asked
,
the
other
nothing
.
It
was
not
true
;
*NL*
she
knew
that
,
and
tried
to
put
it
away
,
but
the
natural
craving
for
*NL*
affection
was
strong
,
and
Amy
's
happiness
woke
the
hungry
longing
for
*NL*
some
one
to
``
love
with
heart
and
soul
,
and
cling
to

God
let
them
*NL*
be
together

''
*NL*
*NL*
Up
in
the
garret
,
where
Jo
's
unquiet
wanderings
ended
,
stood
four
little
*NL*
wooden
chests
in
a
row
,
each
marked
with
its
owner
's
name
,
and
each
*NL*
filled
with
relics
of
the
childhood
and
girlhood
ended
now
for
all
.
Jo
*NL*
glanced
into
them
,
and
when
she
came
to
her
own
,
leaned
her
chin
on
the
*NL*
edge
,
and
stared
absently
at
the
chaotic
collection
,
till
a
bundle
of
*NL*
old
exercise-books
caught
her
eye
.
She
drew
them
out
,
turned
them
over
,
*NL*
and
re-lived
that
pleasant
winter
at
kind
Mrs.
Kirke
's
.
She
had
smiled
*NL*
at
first
,
then
she
looked
thoughtful
,
next
sad
,
and
when
she
came
to
a
*NL*
little
message
written
in
the
Professor
's
hand
,
her
lips
began
to
*NL*
tremble
,
the
books
slid
out
of
her
lap
,
and
she
sat
looking
at
the
*NL*
friendly
words
,
as
if
they
took
a
new
meaning
,
and
touched
a
tender
spot
*NL*
in
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
me
,
my
friend
.
I
may
be
a
little
late
,
but
I
shall
surely
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
if
he
only
would
!
So
kind
,
so
good
,
so
patient
with
me
always
;
my
*NL*
dear
old
Fritz
,
I
did
n't
value
him
half
enough
when
I
had
him
,
but
now
*NL*
how
I
should
love
to
see
him
,
for
every
one
seems
going
away
from
me
,
*NL*
and
I
'm
all
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
holding
the
little
paper
fast
,
as
if
it
were
a
promise
yet
to
be
*NL*
fulfilled
,
Jo
laid
her
head
down
on
a
comfortable
rag-bag
,
and
cried
,
as
*NL*
if
in
opposition
to
the
rain
pattering
on
the
roof
.

SURPRISES
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
was
alone
in
the
twilight
,
lying
on
the
old
sofa
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
thinking
.
It
was
her
favorite
way
of
spending
the
hour
of
*NL*
dusk
;
no
one
disturbed
her
,
and
she
used
to
lie
there
on
Beth
's
little
*NL*
red
pillow
,
planning
stories
,
dreaming
dreams
,
or
thinking
tender
*NL*
thoughts
of
the
sister
who
never
seemed
far
away
.
Her
face
looked
tired
,
*NL*
grave
,
and
rather
sad
;
for
to-morrow
was
her
birthday
,
and
she
was
*NL*
thinking
how
fast
the
years
went
by
,
how
old
she
was
getting
,
and
how
*NL*
little
she
seemed
to
have
accomplished
.
Almost
twenty-five
,
and
nothing
*NL*
to
show
for
it
.
Jo
was
mistaken
in
that
;
there
was
a
good
deal
to
show
,
*NL*
and
by
and
by
she
saw
,
and
was
grateful
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
old
maid
,
that
's
what
I
'm
to
be
.
A
literary
spinster
,
with
a
pen
for
*NL*
a
spouse
,
a
family
of
stories
for
children
,
and
twenty
years
hence
a
*NL*
morsel
of
fame
,
perhaps
;
when
,
like
poor
Johnson
,
I
'm
old
,
and
ca
n't
*NL*
enjoy
it
,
solitary
,
and
ca
n't
share
it
,
independent
,
and
do
n't
need
it
.
*NL*
Well
,
I
need
n't
be
a
sour
saint
nor
a
selfish
sinner
;
and
,
I
dare
say
,
*NL*
old
maids
are
very
comfortable
when
they
get
used
to
it
;
but
--
''
and
*NL*
there
Jo
sighed
,
as
if
the
prospect
was
not
inviting
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seldom
is
,
at
first
,
and
thirty
seems
the
end
of
all
things
to
*NL*
five-and-twenty
;
but
it
's
not
so
bad
as
it
looks
,
and
one
can
get
on
*NL*
quite
happily
if
one
has
something
in
one
's
self
to
fall
back
upon
.
At
*NL*
twenty-five
,
girls
begin
to
talk
about
being
old
maids
,
but
secretly
*NL*
resolve
that
they
never
will
be
;
at
thirty
they
say
nothing
about
it
,
*NL*
but
quietly
accept
the
fact
,
and
,
if
sensible
,
console
themselves
by
*NL*
remembering
that
they
have
twenty
more
useful
,
happy
years
,
in
which
*NL*
they
may
be
learning
to
grow
old
gracefully
.
Do
n't
laugh
at
the
*NL*
spinsters
,
dear
girls
,
for
often
very
tender
,
tragical
romances
are
*NL*
hidden
away
in
the
hearts
that
beat
so
quietly
under
the
sober
gowns
,
*NL*
and
many
silent
sacrifices
of
youth
,
health
,
ambition
,
love
itself
,
make
*NL*
the
faded
faces
beautiful
in
God
's
sight
.
Even
the
sad
,
sour
sisters
*NL*
should
be
kindly
dealt
with
,
because
they
have
missed
the
sweetest
part
*NL*
of
life
,
if
for
no
other
reason
;
and
,
looking
at
them
with
compassion
,
*NL*
not
contempt
,
girls
in
their
bloom
should
remember
that
they
too
may
*NL*
miss
the
blossom
time
;
that
rosy
cheeks
do
n't
last
forever
,
that
silver
*NL*
threads
will
come
in
the
bonnie
brown
hair
,
and
that
,
by
and
by
,
*NL*
kindness
and
respect
will
be
as
sweet
as
love
and
admiration
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentlemen
,
which
means
boys
,
be
courteous
to
the
old
maids
,
no
matter
*NL*
how
poor
and
plain
and
prim
,
for
the
only
chivalry
worth
having
is
that
*NL*
which
is
the
readiest
to
pay
deference
to
the
old
,
protect
the
feeble
,
*NL*
and
serve
womankind
,
regardless
of
rank
,
age
,
or
color
.
Just
recollect
*NL*
the
good
aunts
who
have
not
only
lectured
and
fussed
,
but
nursed
and
*NL*
petted
,
too
often
without
thanks
;
the
scrapes
they
have
helped
you
out
*NL*
of
,
the
``
tips
''
they
have
given
you
from
their
small
store
,
the
stitches
*NL*
the
patient
old
fingers
have
set
for
you
,
the
steps
the
willing
old
feet
*NL*
have
taken
,
and
gratefully
pay
the
dear
old
ladies
the
little
attentions
*NL*
that
women
love
to
receive
as
long
as
they
live
.
The
bright-eyed
girls
*NL*
are
quick
to
see
such
traits
,
and
will
like
you
all
the
better
for
them
;
*NL*
and
if
death
,
almost
the
only
power
that
can
part
mother
and
son
,
*NL*
should
rob
you
of
yours
,
you
will
be
sure
to
find
a
tender
welcome
and
*NL*
maternal
cherishing
from
some
Aunt
Priscilla
,
who
has
kept
the
warmest
*NL*
corner
of
her
lonely
old
heart
for
the
``
the
best
nevvy
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
must
have
fallen
asleep
-LRB-
as
I
dare
say
my
reader
has
during
this
*NL*
little
homily
-RRB-
,
for
suddenly
Laurie
's
ghost
seemed
to
stand
before
*NL*
her
,
--
a
substantial
,
lifelike
ghost
,
--
leaning
over
her
,
with
the
very
*NL*
look
he
used
to
wear
when
he
felt
a
good
deal
and
did
n't
like
to
show
*NL*
it
.
But
,
like
Jenny
in
the
ballad
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
could
not
think
it
he
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
lay
staring
up
at
him
in
startled
silence
,
till
he
stooped
and
*NL*
kissed
her
.
Then
she
knew
him
,
and
flew
up
,
crying
joyfully
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
my
Teddy
!
O
my
Teddy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Jo
,
you
are
glad
to
see
me
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Glad
!
My
blessed
boy
,
words
ca
n't
express
my
gladness
.
Where
's
Amy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
mother
has
got
her
down
at
Meg
's
.
We
stopped
there
by
the
way
,
and
*NL*
there
was
no
getting
my
wife
out
of
their
clutches
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
what
?
''
cried
Jo
,
for
Laurie
uttered
those
two
words
with
an
*NL*
unconscious
pride
and
satisfaction
which
betrayed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
the
dickens
!
now
I
've
done
it
;
''
and
he
looked
so
guilty
that
Jo
was
*NL*
down
upon
him
like
a
flash
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
gone
and
got
married
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
please
,
but
I
never
will
again
;
''
and
he
went
down
upon
his
knees
,
*NL*
with
a
penitent
clasping
of
hands
,
and
a
face
full
of
mischief
,
mirth
,
*NL*
and
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Actually
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
so
,
thank
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
on
us
!
What
dreadful
thing
will
you
do
next
?
''
and
Jo
fell
into
*NL*
her
seat
,
with
a
gasp
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
characteristic
,
but
not
exactly
complimentary
,
congratulation
,
''
*NL*
returned
Laurie
,
still
in
an
abject
attitude
,
but
beaming
with
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
you
expect
,
when
you
take
one
's
breath
away
,
creeping
in
like
*NL*
a
burglar
,
and
letting
cats
out
of
bags
like
that
?
Get
up
,
you
*NL*
ridiculous
boy
,
and
tell
me
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
,
unless
you
let
me
come
in
my
old
place
,
and
promise
not
to
*NL*
barricade
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
laughed
at
that
as
she
had
not
done
for
many
a
long
day
,
and
patted
*NL*
the
sofa
invitingly
,
as
she
said
,
in
a
cordial
tone
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
old
pillow
is
up
garret
,
and
we
do
n't
need
it
now
;
so
,
come
and
*NL*
`
fess
,
Teddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
it
sounds
to
hear
you
say
`
Teddy
'
!
No
one
ever
calls
me
that
*NL*
but
you
;
''
and
Laurie
sat
down
,
with
an
air
of
great
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
Amy
call
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lord
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
like
her
.
Well
,
you
look
it
;
''
and
Jo
's
eyes
plainly
betrayed
*NL*
that
she
found
her
boy
comelier
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pillow
was
gone
,
but
there
_
was
_
a
barricade
,
nevertheless
,
--
a
*NL*
natural
one
,
raised
by
time
,
absence
,
and
change
of
heart
.
Both
felt
it
,
*NL*
and
for
a
minute
looked
at
one
another
as
if
that
invisible
barrier
cast
*NL*
a
little
shadow
over
them
.
It
was
gone
directly
,
however
,
for
Laurie
*NL*
said
,
with
a
vain
attempt
at
dignity
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
I
look
like
a
married
man
and
the
head
of
a
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
,
and
you
never
will
.
You
've
grown
bigger
and
bonnier
,
but
you
*NL*
are
the
same
scapegrace
as
ever
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
really
,
Jo
,
you
ought
to
treat
me
with
more
respect
,
''
began
*NL*
Laurie
,
who
enjoyed
it
all
immensely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
,
when
the
mere
idea
of
you
,
married
and
settled
,
is
so
*NL*
irresistibly
funny
that
I
ca
n't
keep
sober
!
''
answered
Jo
,
smiling
all
*NL*
over
her
face
,
so
infectiously
that
they
had
another
laugh
,
and
then
*NL*
settled
down
for
a
good
talk
,
quite
in
the
pleasant
old
fashion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
no
use
your
going
out
in
the
cold
to
get
Amy
,
for
they
are
all
*NL*
coming
up
presently
.
I
could
n't
wait
;
I
wanted
to
be
the
one
to
tell
you
*NL*
the
grand
surprise
,
and
have
`
first
skim
,
'
as
we
used
to
say
when
we
*NL*
squabbled
about
the
cream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
did
,
and
spoilt
your
story
by
beginning
at
the
wrong
end
.
*NL*
Now
,
start
right
,
and
tell
me
how
it
all
happened
;
I
'm
pining
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
did
it
to
please
Amy
,
''
began
Laurie
,
with
a
twinkle
that
made
*NL*
Jo
exclaim
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fib
number
one
;
Amy
did
it
to
please
you
.
Go
on
,
and
tell
the
truth
,
if
*NL*
you
can
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
she
's
beginning
to
marm
it
;
is
n't
it
jolly
to
hear
her
?
''
said
*NL*
Laurie
to
the
fire
,
and
the
fire
glowed
and
sparkled
as
if
it
quite
*NL*
agreed
.
``
It
's
all
the
same
,
you
know
,
she
and
I
being
one
.
We
planned
to
*NL*
come
home
with
the
Carrols
,
a
month
or
more
ago
,
but
they
suddenly
*NL*
changed
their
minds
,
and
decided
to
pass
another
winter
in
Paris
.
But
*NL*
grandpa
wanted
to
come
home
;
he
went
to
please
me
,
and
I
could
n't
let
*NL*
him
go
alone
,
neither
could
I
leave
Amy
;
and
Mrs.
Carrol
had
got
English
*NL*
notions
about
chaperons
and
such
nonsense
,
and
would
n't
let
Amy
come
*NL*
with
us
.
So
I
just
settled
the
difficulty
by
saying
,
`
Let
's
be
married
,
*NL*
and
then
we
can
do
as
we
like
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
did
;
you
always
have
things
to
suit
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
always
;
''
and
something
in
Laurie
's
voice
made
Jo
say
hastily
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
ever
get
aunt
to
agree
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
hard
work
;
but
,
between
us
,
we
talked
her
over
,
for
we
had
heaps
*NL*
of
good
reasons
on
our
side
.
There
was
n't
time
to
write
and
ask
leave
,
*NL*
but
you
all
liked
it
,
had
consented
to
it
by
and
by
,
and
it
was
only
*NL*
`
taking
Time
by
the
fetlock

as
my
wife
says
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
n't

proud
of

and
do
n't
we
like
to
say
them
?
''
*NL*
interrupted
Jo
,
addressing
the
fire
in
her
turn
,
and
watching
with
*NL*
delight
the
happy
light
it
seemed
to
kindle
in
the
eyes
that
had
been
so
*NL*
tragically
gloomy
when
she
saw
them
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
trifle
,
perhaps
;
she
's
such
a
captivating
little
woman
I
ca
n't
help
*NL*
being
proud
of
her
.
Well
,
then
,
uncle
and
aunt
were
there
to
play
*NL*
propriety
;
we
were
so
absorbed
in
one
another
we
were
of
no
mortal
use
*NL*
apart
,
and
that
charming
arrangement
would
make
everything
easy
all
*NL*
round
;
so
we
did
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
,
where
,
how
?
''
asked
Jo
,
in
a
fever
of
feminine
interest
and
*NL*
curiosity
,
for
she
could
not
realize
it
a
particle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Six
weeks
ago
,
at
the
American
consul
's
,
in
Paris
;
a
very
quiet
*NL*
wedding
,
of
course
,
for
even
in
our
happiness
we
did
n't
forget
dear
*NL*
little
Beth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
put
her
hand
in
his
as
he
said
that
,
and
Laurie
gently
smoothed
the
*NL*
little
red
pillow
,
which
he
remembered
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
n't
you
let
us
know
afterward
?
''
asked
Jo
,
in
a
quieter
tone
,
*NL*
when
they
had
sat
quite
still
a
minute
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wanted
to
surprise
you
;
we
thought
we
were
coming
directly
home
,
at
*NL*
first
;
but
the
dear
old
gentleman
,
as
soon
as
we
were
married
,
found
he
*NL*
could
n't
be
ready
under
a
month
,
at
least
,
and
sent
us
off
to
spend
our
*NL*
honeymoon
wherever
we
liked
.
Amy
had
once
called
Valrosa
a
regular
*NL*
honeymoon
home
,
so
we
went
there
,
and
were
as
happy
as
people
are
but
*NL*
once
in
their
lives
.
My
faith
!
was
n't
it
love
among
the
roses
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laurie
seemed
to
forget
Jo
for
a
minute
,
and
Jo
was
glad
of
it
;
for
the
*NL*
fact
that
he
told
her
these
things
so
freely
and
naturally
assured
her
*NL*
that
he
had
quite
forgiven
and
forgotten
.
She
tried
to
draw
away
her
*NL*
hand
;
but
,
as
if
he
guessed
the
thought
that
prompted
the
*NL*
half-involuntary
impulse
,
Laurie
held
it
fast
,
and
said
,
with
a
manly
*NL*
gravity
she
had
never
seen
in
him
before
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
,
dear
,
I
want
to
say
one
thing
,
and
then
we
'll
put
it
by
forever
.
As
*NL*
I
told
you
in
my
letter
,
when
I
wrote
that
Amy
had
been
so
kind
to
me
,
I
*NL*
never
shall
stop
loving
you
;
but
the
love
is
altered
,
and
I
have
learned
*NL*
to
see
that
it
is
better
as
it
is
.
Amy
and
you
change
places
in
my
*NL*
heart
,
that
's
all
.
I
think
it
was
meant
to
be
so
,
and
would
have
come
*NL*
about
naturally
,
if
I
had
waited
,
as
you
tried
to
make
me
;
but
I
never
*NL*
could
be
patient
,
and
so
I
got
a
heartache
.
I
was
a
boy
then
,
headstrong
*NL*
and
violent
;
and
it
took
a
hard
lesson
to
show
me
my
mistake
.
For
it
*NL*
_
was
_
one
,
Jo
,
as
you
said
,
and
I
found
it
out
,
after
making
a
fool
of
*NL*
myself
.
Upon
my
word
,
I
was
so
tumbled
up
in
my
mind
,
at
one
time
,
that
*NL*
I
did
n't
know
which
I
loved
best
,
you
or
Amy
,
and
tried
to
love
both
*NL*
alike
;
but
I
could
n't
,
and
when
I
saw
her
in
Switzerland
,
everything
*NL*
seemed
to
clear
up
all
at
once
.
You
both
got
into
your
right
places
,
and
*NL*
I
felt
sure
that
it
was
well
off
with
the
old
love
before
it
was
on
with
*NL*
the
new
;
that
I
could
honestly
share
my
heart
between
sister
Jo
and
wife
*NL*
Amy
,
and
love
them
both
dearly
.
Will
you
believe
it
,
and
go
back
to
the
*NL*
happy
old
times
when
we
first
knew
one
another
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
believe
it
,
with
all
my
heart
;
but
,
Teddy
,
we
never
can
be
boy
and
*NL*
girl
again
:
the
happy
old
times
ca
n't
come
back
,
and
we
must
n't
expect
*NL*
it
.
We
are
man
and
woman
now
,
with
sober
work
to
do
,
for
playtime
is
*NL*
over
,
and
we
must
give
up
frolicking
.
I
'm
sure
you
feel
this
;
I
see
the
*NL*
change
in
you
,
and
you
'll
find
it
in
me
.
I
shall
miss
my
boy
,
but
I
*NL*
shall
love
the
man
as
much
,
and
admire
him
more
,
because
he
means
to
be
*NL*
what
I
hoped
he
would
.
We
ca
n't
be
little
playmates
any
longer
,
but
we
*NL*
will
be
brother
and
sister
,
to
love
and
help
one
another
all
our
lives
,
*NL*
wo
n't
we
,
Laurie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
say
a
word
,
but
took
the
hand
she
offered
him
,
and
laid
his
*NL*
face
down
on
it
for
a
minute
,
feeling
that
out
of
the
grave
of
a
boyish
*NL*
passion
,
there
had
risen
a
beautiful
,
strong
friendship
to
bless
them
*NL*
both
.
Presently
Jo
said
cheerfully
,
for
she
did
n't
want
the
coming
home
*NL*
to
be
a
sad
one
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
make
it
true
that
you
children
are
really
married
,
and
going
to
*NL*
set
up
housekeeping
.
Why
,
it
seems
only
yesterday
that
I
was
buttoning
*NL*
Amy
's
pinafore
,
and
pulling
your
hair
when
you
teased
.
Mercy
me
,
how
*NL*
time
does
fly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
one
of
the
children
is
older
than
yourself
,
you
need
n't
talk
so
like
*NL*
a
grandma
.
I
flatter
myself
I
'm
a
`
gentleman
growed
,
'
as
Peggotty
said
*NL*
of
David
;
and
when
you
see
Amy
,
you
'll
find
her
rather
a
precocious
*NL*
infant
,
''
said
Laurie
,
looking
amused
at
her
maternal
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
be
a
little
older
in
years
,
but
I
'm
ever
so
much
older
in
*NL*
feeling

Teddy
.
Women
always
are
;
and
this
last
year
has
been
such
a
*NL*
hard
one
that
I
feel
forty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Jo
!
we
left
you
to
bear
it
alone
,
while
we
went
pleasuring

You
*NL*

older

here
's
a
line

and
there
's
another
;
unless
you
smile
,
your
*NL*
eyes
look
sad
,
and
when
I
touched
the
cushion
,
just
now
,
I
found
a
tear
*NL*
on
it
.
You
've
had
a
great
deal
to
bear
,
and
had
to
bear
it
all
alone

*NL*
What
a
selfish
beast
I
've
been
!
''
and
Laurie
pulled
his
own
hair
,
with
a
*NL*
remorseful
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Jo
only
turned
over
the
traitorous
pillow
,
and
answered
,
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
she
tried
to
make
quite
cheerful
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
had
father
and
mother
to
help
me

the
dear
babies
to
comfort
me
,
*NL*
and
the
thought
that
you
and
Amy
were
safe
and
happy
,
to
make
the
*NL*
troubles
here
easier
to
bear
.
I
_
am
_
lonely
,
sometimes
,
but
I
dare
say
*NL*
it
's
good
for
me
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
never
shall
be
again
,
''
broke
in
Laurie
,
putting
his
arm
about
her
,
*NL*
as
if
to
fence
out
every
human
ill
.
``
Amy
and
I
ca
n't
get
on
without
*NL*
you
,
so
you
must
come
and
teach
`
the
children
'
to
keep
house
,
and
go
*NL*
halves
in
everything
,
just
as
we
used
to
do
,
and
let
us
pet
you

be
blissfully
happy

friendly
together

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
should
n't
be
in

it
would
be
very
pleasant

I
begin
to
*NL*
feel
quite
young
already
;
for
,
somehow
,
all
my
troubles
seemed
to
fly
*NL*
away
when
you
came

You
always
were
a
comfort

Teddy

and
Jo
leaned
her
*NL*
head
on
his
shoulder
,
just
as
she
did
years
ago
,
when
Beth
lay
ill
,
and
*NL*
Laurie
told
her
to
hold
on
to
him

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
down
at
her
,
wondering
if
she
remembered
the
time

Jo
was
*NL*
smiling
to
herself
,
as
if
,
in
truth
,
her
troubles
_
had
_
all
vanished
at
*NL*
his
coming

*NL*
``
You
are

still

dropping
tears
about
one
minute

laughing
the
next

look
a
little
wicked
now
;
what
is
it

grandma

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
wondering
how
you

get
on
together

``
Like
angels

*NL*
``
Yes

which
rules

*NL*
``
I
do

telling

now

at

I
let
her
think

so
,

it
pleases
her

you
know

By
and
by
we
shall
take
turns

for

marriage

halves
one

rights
and
doubles
one

duties

*NL*
``
You
'll
go
on

will
rule
you
all
the
days
of
your
*NL*
life

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
she
does
it
so
imperceptibly

I
do

mind
*NL*
much

She
is
the
sort
of
woman
who
knows
how
to
rule
well
;
in
fact

I
*NL*
rather
like
it
,
for
she
winds
one
round
her
finger
as
softly
and
*NL*
prettily
as
a
skein
of
silk
,

makes
you
feel
as

doing
you

a
favor
all
the

*NL*
``
That
ever

enjoying

it

cried
Jo
,
with
uplifted
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
good
to
see
Laurie
square
his
shoulders
,
and
smile
with
masculine
*NL*
scorn
at
that
insinuation
,
as
he
replied
,
with
his
``
high
and
mighty
''
*NL*
air
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amy
is
too
well-bred
for
that

am
not
the
sort

I
respect
ourselves

one
another
too
much
ever
to

tyrannize
or
quarrel

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
liked
that
,
and
thought
the
new
dignity
very
becoming
,
but
the
boy
*NL*
seemed
changing
very
fast
into
the
man
,
and
regret
mingled
with
her
*NL*
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
of
that
;
Amy
and
you
never
did
quarrel
as
we
used
to

She
is

the
sun
and
I
the
wind

in
the
fable

the
sun
managed
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
can
blow
him
up
as
well

laughed
Laurie
.
``
Such
a

lecture
as
I
got
at

give
you
my

a

worse

rouser

I
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
*NL*
sometime

never

,
after
telling
me
that

despised
*NL*

was
ashamed

she
lost
her
heart

despicable
party

good-for-nothing

``

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
look
as
if
I
needed
it

do

said
Laurie
,
getting
up
and
*NL*
striking
an
attitude
which
suddenly
changed
from
the
imposing
to
the
*NL*
rapturous
,
as
Amy
's
voice
was
heard
calling
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
?
Where
's
my
dear
old
Jo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
trooped
the
whole
family
,
and
every
one
was
hugged
and
kissed
all
*NL*
over
again
,
and
,
after
several
vain
attempts
,
the
three
wanderers
were
*NL*
set
down
to
be
looked
at
and
exulted
over
.
Mr.
Laurence
,
hale
and
hearty
*NL*
as
ever
,
was
quite
as
much
improved
as
the
others
by
his
foreign
tour
,
*NL*
for
the
crustiness
seemed
to
be
nearly
gone
,
and
the
old-fashioned
*NL*
courtliness
had
received
a
polish
which
made
it
kindlier
than
ever
.
It
*NL*
was
good
to
see
him
beam
at
``
my
children
,
''
as
he
called
the
young
pair
;
*NL*
it
was
better
still
to
see
Amy
pay
him
the
daughterly
duty
and
affection
*NL*
which
completely
won
his
old
heart
;
and
best
of
all
,
to
watch
Laurie
*NL*
revolve
about
the
two
,
as
if
never
tired
of
enjoying
the
pretty
picture
*NL*
they
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
minute
she
put
her
eyes
upon
Amy
,
Meg
became
conscious
that
her
own
*NL*
dress
had
n't
a
Parisian
air
,
that
young
Mrs.
Moffat
would
be
entirely
*NL*
eclipsed
by
young
Mrs.
Laurence
,
and
that
``
her
ladyship
''
was
altogether
*NL*
a
most
elegant
and
graceful
woman
.
Jo
thought
,
as
she
watched
the
pair
,
*NL*
``
How
well
they
look
together
!
I
was
right
,
and
Laurie
has
found
the
*NL*
beautiful
,
accomplished
girl
who
will
become
his
home
better
than
clumsy
*NL*
old
Jo
,
and
be
a
pride
,
not
a
torment
to
him
.
''
Mrs.
March
and
her
*NL*
husband
smiled
and
nodded
at
each
other
with
happy
faces
,
for
they
saw
*NL*
that
their
youngest
had
done
well
,
not
only
in
worldly
things
,
but
the
*NL*
better
wealth
of
love
,
confidence
,
and
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
Amy
's
face
was
full
of
the
soft
brightness
which
betokens
a
peaceful
*NL*
heart
,
her
voice
had
a
new
tenderness
in
it
,
and
the
cool
,
prim
carriage
*NL*
was
changed
to
a
gentle
dignity
,
both
womanly
and
winning
.
No
little
*NL*
affectations
marred
it
,
and
the
cordial
sweetness
of
her
manner
was
more
*NL*
charming
than
the
new
beauty
or
the
old
grace
,
for
it
stamped
her
at
*NL*
once
with
the
unmistakable
sign
of
the
true
gentlewoman
she
had
hoped
to
*NL*
become
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Love
has
done
much
for
our
little
girl
,
''
said
her
mother
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
had
a
good
example
before
her
all
her
life
,
my
dear
,
''
Mr.
March
*NL*
whispered
back
,
with
a
loving
look
at
the
worn
face
and
gray
head
beside
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daisy
found
it
impossible
to
keep
her
eyes
of
her
``
pitty
aunty
,
''
but
*NL*
attached
herself
like
a
lap-dog
to
the
wonderful
chatelaine
full
of
*NL*
delightful
charms
.
Demi
paused
to
consider
the
new
relationship
before
*NL*
he
compromised
himself
by
the
rash
acceptance
of
a
bribe
,
which
took
the
*NL*
tempting
form
of
a
family
of
wooden
bears
from
Berne
.
A
flank
movement
*NL*
produced
an
unconditional
surrender
,
however
,
for
Laurie
knew
where
to
*NL*
have
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Young
man
,
when
I
first
had
the
honor
of
making
your
acquaintance
you
*NL*
hit
me
in
the

now
I
demand
the
satisfaction
of
a
gentleman
;
''
and
*NL*
with
that
the
tall
uncle
proceeded
to
toss
and
tousle
the
small
nephew
*NL*
in
a
way
that
damaged
his
philosophical
dignity
as
much
as
it
delighted
*NL*
his
boyish
soul
.

muttered
old
Hannah
,
who
could
not
*NL*
resist
frequent
``
peeks
''
through
the
slide
as
she
set
the
table
in
a
most
*NL*
decidedly
promiscuous
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mercy
on
us
,
how
they
did
talk
!
first
one
,
then
the
other
,
then
all
*NL*
burst
out
together
,
trying
to
tell
the
history
of
three
years
in
half
an
*NL*
hour
.
It
was
fortunate
that
tea
was
at
hand
,
to
produce
a
lull
and
*NL*
provide
refreshment
,
for
they
would
have
been
hoarse
and
faint
if
they
*NL*
had
gone
on
much
longer
.
Such
a
happy
procession
as
filed
away
into
the
*NL*
little
dining-room
!
Mr.
March
proudly
escorted
``
Mrs.
Laurence
;
''
Mrs.
*NL*
March
as
proudly
leaned
on
the
arm
of
``
my
son
;
''
the
old
gentleman
took
*NL*
Jo
,
with
a
whispered
``
You
must
be
my
girl
now
,
''
and
a
glance
at
the
*NL*
empty
corner
by
the
fire
,
that
made
Jo
whisper
back
,
with
trembling
*NL*
lips
,
``
I
'll
try
to
fill
her
place
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
twins
pranced
behind
,
feeling
that
the
millennium
was
at
hand
,
for
*NL*
every
one
was
so
busy
with
the
new-comers
that
they
were
left
to
revel
*NL*
at
their
own
sweet
will
,
and
you
may
be
sure
they
made
the
most
of
the
*NL*
opportunity
.
Did
n't
they
steal
sips
of
tea
,
stuff
gingerbread
_
ab
*NL*
libitum
_
,
get
a
hot
biscuit
apiece
,
and
,
as
a
crowning
trespass
,
did
n't
*NL*
they
each
whisk
a
captivating
little
tart
into
their
tiny
pockets
,
there
*NL*
to
stick
and
crumble
treacherously
,
teaching
them
that
both
human
nature
*NL*
and
pastry
are
frail
?
Burdened
with
the
guilty
consciousness
of
the
*NL*
sequestered
tarts
,
and
fearing
that
Dodo
's
sharp
eyes
would
pierce
the
*NL*
thin
disguise
of
cambric
and
merino
which
hid
their
booty
,
the
little
*NL*
sinners
attached
themselves
to
``
Dranpa
,
''
who
had
n't
his
spectacles
on
.
*NL*
Amy
,
who
was
handed
about
like
refreshments
,
returned
to
the
parlor
on
*NL*
Father
Laurence
's
arm
;
the
others
paired
off
as
before
,
and
this
*NL*
arrangement
left
Jo
companionless
.
She
did
not
mind
it
at
the
minute
,
*NL*
for
she
lingered
to
answer
Hannah
's
eager
inquiry
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
Miss
Amy
ride
in
her
coop

lovely
*NL*
silver
dishes
that
's
stored
away
over

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
n't
wonder
if
she
drove
six
white
horses
,
ate
off
gold
plate
,
and
*NL*
wore
diamonds
and
point-lace
every
day
.
Teddy
thinks
nothing
too
good
*NL*
for
her
,
''
returned
Jo
with
infinite
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
there
is
!
Will
you
have
hash
or
fish-balls
for
breakfast
?
''
*NL*
asked
Hannah
,
who
wisely
mingled
poetry
and
prose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
;
''
and
Jo
shut
the
door
,
feeling
that
food
was
an
*NL*
uncongenial
topic
just
then
.
She
stood
a
minute
looking
at
the
party
*NL*
vanishing
above
,
and
,
as
Demi
's
short
plaid
legs
toiled
up
the
last
*NL*
stair
,
a
sudden
sense
of
loneliness
came
over
her
so
strongly
that
she
*NL*
looked
about
her
with
dim
eyes
,
as
if
to
find
something
to
lean
upon
,
*NL*
for
even
Teddy
had
deserted
her
.
If
she
had
known
what
birthday
gift
was
*NL*
coming
every
minute
nearer
and
nearer
,
she
would
not
have
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
I
'll
weep
a
little
weep
when
I
go
to
bed
;
it
wo
n't
do
to
be
*NL*
dismal
now
.
''
Then
she
drew
her
hand
over
her
eyes
,
--
for
one
of
her
*NL*
boyish
habits
was
never
to
know
where
her
handkerchief
was
,
--
and
had
*NL*
just
managed
to
call
up
a
smile
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
*NL*
porch-door
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
opened
it
with
hospitable
haste
,
and
started
as
if
another
ghost
had
*NL*
come
to
surprise
her
;
for
there
stood
a
tall
,
bearded
gentleman
,
beaming
*NL*
on
her
from
the
darkness
like
a
midnight
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
Mr.
Bhaer
,
I
_
am
_
so
glad
to
see
you
!
''
cried
Jo
,
with
a
clutch
,
as
if
*NL*
she
feared
the
night
would
swallow
him
up
before
she
could
get
him
in
.

''
and
the
Professor
*NL*
paused
as
the
sound
of
voices
and
the
tap
of
dancing
feet
came
down
to
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
we
have

only
the

My

and

have
just

and
we
are
all
very
happy
.
Come

,
and
make
one
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
a
very
social
man
,
I
think
Mr.
Bhaer
would
have
gone
decorously
*NL*
away
,
and
come
again
another
day
;
but
how
could
he
,
when
Jo
shut
the
*NL*
door
behind
him
,
and
bereft
him
of
his
hat
?
Perhaps
her
face
had
*NL*
something
to
do
with
it
,
for
she
forgot
to
hide
her
joy
at
seeing
him
,
*NL*
and
showed
it
with
a
frankness
that
proved
irresistible
to
the
solitary
*NL*
man
,
whose
welcome
far
exceeded
his
boldest
hopes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
shall
not
be
Monsieur
de

I

so
gladly

all

You

ill
,
my
friend
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
the
question
abruptly
,
for
,
as
Jo
hung
up
his
coat
,
the
light
*NL*
fell
on
her
face
,
and
he
saw
a
change
in
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
ill
,
but
tired
and
sorrowful
.
We
have
had
trouble
since
I
saw
you
*NL*
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
,
I
know
.
My
heart
was
sore
for
you
when
I
heard
that
;
''
and
he
*NL*
shook
hands
again
,
with
such
a
sympathetic
face
that
Jo
felt
as
if
no
*NL*
comfort
could
equal
the
look
of
the
kind
eyes
,
the
grasp
of
the
big
,
*NL*
warm
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
mother
,
this
is
my
friend
,
Professor
Bhaer
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
*NL*
face
and
tone
of
such
irrepressible
pride
and
pleasure
that
she
might
as
*NL*
well
have
blown
a
trumpet
and
opened
the
door
with
a
flourish
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
stranger
had
had
any
doubts
about
his
reception
,
they
were
set
at
*NL*
rest
in
a
minute
by
the
cordial
welcome
he
received
.
Every
one
greeted
*NL*
him
kindly
,
for
Jo
's
sake
at
first
,
but
very
soon
they
liked
him
for
his
*NL*
own
.
They
could
not
help
it
,
for
he
carried
the
talisman
that
opens
all
*NL*
hearts
,
and
these
simple
people
warmed
to
him
at
once
,
feeling
even
the
*NL*
more
friendly
because
he
was
poor
;
for
poverty
enriches
those
who
live
*NL*
above
it
,
and
is
a
sure
passport
to
truly
hospitable
spirits
.
Mr.
Bhaer
*NL*
sat
looking
about
him
with
the
air
of
a
traveller
who
knocks
at
a
*NL*
strange
door
,
and
,
when
it
opens
,
finds
himself
at
home
.
The
children
*NL*
went
to
him
like
bees
to
a
honey-pot
;
and
,
establishing
themselves
on
*NL*
each
knee
,
proceeded
to
captivate
him
by
rifling
his
pockets
,
pulling
*NL*
his
beard
,
and
investigating
his
watch
,
with
juvenile
audacity
.
The
*NL*
women
telegraphed
their
approval
to
one
another
,
and
Mr.
March
,
feeling
*NL*
that
he
had
got
a
kindred
spirit
,
opened
his
choicest
stores
for
his
*NL*
guest
's
benefit
,
while
silent
John
listened
and
enjoyed
the
talk
,
but
*NL*
said
not
a
word
,
and
Mr.
Laurence
found
it
impossible
to
go
to
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Jo
had
not
been
otherwise
engaged
,
Laurie
's
behavior
would
have
*NL*
amused
her
;
for
a
faint
twinge
,
not
of
jealousy
,
but
something
like
*NL*
suspicion
,
caused
that
gentleman
to
stand
aloof
at
first
,
and
observe
*NL*
the
new-comer
with
brotherly
circumspection
.
But
it
did
not
last
long
.
*NL*
He
got
interested
in
spite
of
himself
,
and
,
before
he
knew
it
,
was
drawn
*NL*
into
the
circle
;
for
Mr.
Bhaer
talked
well
in
this
genial
atmosphere
,
*NL*
and
did
himself
justice
.
He
seldom
spoke
to
Laurie
,
but
he
looked
at
him
*NL*
often
,
and
a
shadow
would
pass
across
his
face
,
as
if
regretting
his
own
*NL*
lost
youth
,
as
he
watched
the
young
man
in
his
prime
.
Then
his
eye
would
*NL*
turn
to
Jo
so
wistfully
that
she
would
have
surely
answered
the
mute
*NL*
inquiry
if
she
had
seen
it
;
but
Jo
had
her
own
eyes
to
take
care
of
,
*NL*
and
,
feeling
that
they
could
not
be
trusted
,
she
prudently
kept
them
on
*NL*
the
little
sock
she
was
knitting
,
like
a
model
maiden
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stealthy
glance
now
and
then
refreshed
her
like
sips
of
fresh
water
*NL*
after
a
dusty
walk
,
for
the
sidelong
peeps
showed
her
several
propitious
*NL*
omens
.
Mr.
Bhaer
's
face
had
lost
the
absent-minded
expression
,
and
*NL*
looked
all
alive
with
interest
in
the
present
moment
,
actually
young
and
*NL*
handsome
,
she
thought
,
forgetting
to
compare
him
with
Laurie
,
as
she
*NL*
usually
did
strange
men
,
to
their
great
detriment
.
Then
he
seemed
quite
*NL*
inspired
,
though
the
burial
customs
of
the
ancients
,
to
which
the
*NL*
conversation
had
strayed
,
might
not
be
considered
an
exhilarating
topic
.
*NL*
Jo
quite
glowed
with
triumph
when
Teddy
got
quenched
in
an
argument
,
and
*NL*
thought
to
herself
,
as
she
watched
her
father
's
absorbed
face
,
``
How
he
*NL*
would
enjoy
having
such
a
man
as
my
Professor
to
talk
with
every
day
!
''
*NL*
Lastly
,
Mr.
Bhaer
was
dressed
in
a
new
suit
of
black
,
which
made
him
*NL*
look
more
like
a
gentleman
than
ever
.
His
bushy
hair
had
been
cut
and
*NL*
smoothly
brushed
,
but
did
n't
stay
in
order
long
,
for
,
in
exciting
*NL*
moments
,
he
rumpled
it
up
in
the
droll
way
he
used
to
do
;
and
Jo
liked
*NL*
it
rampantly
erect
better
than
flat
,
because
she
thought
it
gave
his
*NL*
fine
forehead
a
Jove-like
aspect
.
Poor
Jo
,
how
she
did
glorify
that
*NL*
plain
man
,
as
she
sat
knitting
away
so
quietly
,
yet
letting
nothing
*NL*
escape
her
,
not
even
the
fact
that
Mr.
Bhaer
actually
had
gold
*NL*
sleeve-buttons
in
his
immaculate
wristbands
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
old
fellow
!
He
could
n't
have
got
himself
up
with
more
care
if
he
'd
*NL*
been
going
a-wooing
,
''
said
Jo
to
herself
;
and
then
a
sudden
thought
,
*NL*
born
of
the
words
,
made
her
blush
so
dreadfully
that
she
had
to
drop
her
*NL*
ball
,
and
go
down
after
it
to
hide
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manoeuvre
did
not
succeed
as
well
as
she
expected
,
however
;
for
,
*NL*
though
just
in
the
act
of
setting
fire
to
a
funeral-pile
,
the
Professor
*NL*
dropped
his
torch
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
and
made
a
dive
after
the
*NL*
little
blue
ball
.
Of
course
they
bumped
their
heads
smartly
together
,
*NL*
saw
stars
,
and
both
came
up
flushed
and
laughing
,
without
the
ball
,
to
*NL*
resume
their
seats
,
wishing
they
had
not
left
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
knew
where
the
evening
went
to
;
for
Hannah
skilfully
abstracted
*NL*
the
babies
at
an
early
hour
,
nodding
like
two
rosy
poppies
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Laurence
went
home
to
rest
.
The
others
sat
round
the
fire
,
talking
*NL*
away
,
utterly
regardless
of
the
lapse
of
time
,
till
Meg
,
whose
maternal
*NL*
mind
was
impressed
with
a
firm
conviction
that
Daisy
had
tumbled
out
of
*NL*
bed
,
and
Demi
set
his
night-gown
afire
studying
the
structure
of
*NL*
matches
,
made
a
move
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
have
our
sing
,
in
the
good
old
way
,
for

are
all
together
*NL*
again
once
more
,
''
said
Jo
,
feeling
that
a
good
shout
would
be
a
safe
and
*NL*
pleasant
vent
for
the
jubilant
emotions
of
her
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
not
_
all
_
there
.
But
no
one
found
the
words
thoughtless
or
*NL*
untrue
;
for
Beth
still
seemed
among
them
,
a
peaceful
presence
,
*NL*
invisible
,
but
dearer
than
ever
,
since
death
could
not
break
the
*NL*
household
league
that
love
made
indissoluble
.
The
little
chair
stood
in
*NL*
its
old
place
;
the
tidy
basket
,
with
the
bit
of
work
she
left
unfinished
*NL*
when
the
needle
grew
``
so
heavy
,
''
was
still
on
its
accustomed
shelf
;
the
*NL*
beloved
instrument
,
seldom
touched
now
,
had
not
been
moved
;
and
above
it
*NL*
Beth
's
face
,
serene
and
smiling
,
as
in
the
early
days
,
looked
down
upon
*NL*
them
,
seeming
to
say
,
``
Be
happy
.
I
am
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Play
something
,
Amy
.
Let
them
hear
how
much
you
have
improved
,
''
said
*NL*
Laurie
,
with
pardonable
pride
in
his
promising
pupil
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Amy
whispered
,
with
full
eyes
,
as
she
twirled
the
faded
stool
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-night
,
dear
.
I
ca
n't
show
off
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
did
show
something
better
than
brilliancy
or
skill
;
for
she
sung
*NL*
Beth
's
songs
with
a
tender
music
in
her
voice
which
the
best
master
*NL*
could
not
have
taught
,
and
touched
the
listeners
'
hearts
with
a
sweeter
*NL*
power
than
any
other
inspiration
could
have
given
her
.
The
room
was
very
*NL*
still
,
when
the
clear
voice
failed
suddenly
at
the
last
line
of
Beth
's
*NL*
favorite
hymn
.
It
was
hard
to
say
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Earth
hath
no
sorrow
that
heaven
can
not
heal
;
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
Amy
leaned
against
her
husband
,
who
stood
behind
her
,
feeling
that
*NL*
her
welcome
home
was
not
quite
perfect
without
Beth
's
kiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
we
must
finish
with
Mignon
's
song
;
for
Mr.
Bhaer
sings
that
,
''
said
*NL*
Jo
,
before
the
pause
grew
painful
.
And
Mr.
Bhaer
cleared
his
throat
with
*NL*
a
gratified
``
Hem
!
''
as
he
stepped
into
the
corner
where
Jo
stood
,
*NL*
saying
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
sing
with
me
?
We
go
excellently
well
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
pleasing
fiction
,
by
the
way
;
for
Jo
had
no
more
idea
of
music
than
a
*NL*
grasshopper
.
But
she
would
have
consented
if
he
had
proposed
to
sing
a
*NL*
whole
opera
,
and
warbled
away
,
blissfully
regardless
of
time
and
tune
.
*NL*
It
did
n't
much
matter
;
for
Mr.
Bhaer
sang
like
a
true
German
,
heartily
*NL*
and
well
;
and
Jo
soon
subsided
into
a
subdued
hum
,
that
she
might
listen
*NL*
to
the
mellow
voice
that
seemed
to
sing
for
her
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-

:
Mr.
Bhaer
sang
heartily
-RSB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
Know
`
st
thou
the
land
*NL*
where
the
citron
blooms
,
''
*NL*
*NL*
used
to
be
the
Professor
's
favorite
line
,
for
``
das
land
''
meant
Germany
*NL*
to
him
;
but
now
he
seemed
to
dwell
,
with
peculiar
warmth
and
melody
,
*NL*
upon
the
words
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
oh
there
,
might
I
with
thee
,
*NL*
O
my
beloved
,
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
and
one
listener
was
so
thrilled
by
the
tender
invitation
that
she
*NL*
longed
to
say
she
did
know
the
land
,
and
would
joyfully
depart
thither
*NL*
whenever
he
liked
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
song
was
considered
a
great
success
,
and
the
singer
retired
covered
*NL*
with
laurels
.
But
a
few
minutes
afterward
,
he
forgot
his
manners
*NL*
entirely
,
and
stared
at
Amy
putting
on
her
bonnet
;
for
she
had
been
*NL*
introduced
simply
as
``
my
sister
,
''
and
no
one
had
called
her
by
her
new
*NL*
name
since
he
came
.
He
forgot
himself
still
further
when
Laurie
said
,
in
*NL*
his
most
gracious
manner
,
at
parting
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
wife
and
I
are
very
glad
to
meet
you
,
sir
.
Please
remember
that
*NL*
there
is
always
a
welcome
waiting
for
you
over
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
Professor
thanked
him
so
heartily
,
and
looked
so
suddenly
*NL*
illuminated
with
satisfaction
,
that
Laurie
thought
him
the
most
*NL*
delightfully
demonstrative
old
fellow
he
ever
met
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
too
shall
go
;
but
I
shall
gladly
come
again
,
if
you
will
gif
me
*NL*
leave
,
dear
madame
,
for
a
little
business
in
the
city
will
keep
me
here
*NL*
some
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
to
Mrs.
March
,
but
he
looked
at
Jo
;
and
the
mother
's
voice
gave
*NL*
as
cordial
an
assent
as
did
the
daughter
's
eyes
;
for
Mrs.
March
was
not
*NL*
so
blind
to
her
children
's
interest
as
Mrs.
Moffat
supposed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suspect
that
is
a
wise
man
,
''
remarked
Mr.
March
,
with
placid
*NL*
satisfaction
,
from
the
hearth-rug
,
after
the
last
guest
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
he
is
a
good
one
,
''
added
Mrs.
March
,
with
decided
approval
,
as
*NL*
she
wound
up
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
'd
like
him
,
''
was
all
Jo
said
,
as
she
slipped
away
to
her
*NL*
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
what
the
business
was
that
brought
Mr.
Bhaer
to
the
city
,
*NL*
and
finally
decided
that
he
had
been
appointed
to
some
great
honor
,
*NL*
somewhere
,
but
had
been
too
modest
to
mention
the
fact
.
If
she
had
seen
*NL*
his
face
when
,
safe
in
his
own
room
,
he
looked
at
the
picture
of
a
*NL*
severe
and
rigid
young
lady
,
with
a
good
deal
of
hair
,
who
appeared
to
*NL*
be
gazing
darkly
into
futurity
,
it
might
have
thrown
some
light
upon
the
*NL*
subject
,
especially
when
he
turned
off
the
gas
,
and
kissed
the
picture
*NL*
in
the
dark
.

*NL*
``

*NL*
Mrs.

pressed

wore

asking

for
her
maternal
covetousness

suggested
Jo

Jo
had
grown
quite
her
own
saucy
self
again
since

came
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly

me
pointing

of

an

round
to
the

I
have

had

I
was

after

said
Amy
,
with
a

matronly
air
,
which
delighted
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
going

asked
*NL*
Jo
,
buttoning
Amy
's
cloak
as
she
used
to
button
her
pinafores
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Amy

what
is
she
going
to
do

asked
Mrs.

,
well
pleased
at
*NL*
Laurie
's
decision
,
and
the
energy
with
which
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
After

*NL*
``

answered
Amy
,
resolving
that
there
*NL*
should
be
a
home
with
a
good
wife
in
it
before
she
set
up
a

salon

as
a
*NL*
queen
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
happy

observed
Mr.
March
,
finding
it
*NL*
difficult
to
become
absorbed
in
his
Aristotle
after
the
young
couple
had
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
think

added
Mrs.

,
with
the
restful

expression
of
a
pilot
who
has
brought
a

safely
into

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

and
Jo
sighed
,
then
smiled
brightly
as

Professor
Bhaer
opened
the
gate
with
an
impatient
push
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
in
the
evening
,
when
his
mind
had
been
set
at
rest
about
the
*NL*
bootjack
,
Laurie
said
suddenly
to
his
wife
,
who
was
flitting
about
,
*NL*
arranging
her
new
art
treasures

richer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

Laurie

Amy
caught
herself
up
short
as
*NL*
the
words
escaped
her
,
and
looked
at
her

who
replied

with

malicious
gravity

you
once
thought
it
your

duty

that
accounts

perhaps

I
sometimes

I
might
show
how
much
I
love

and
Amy
,
*NL*
who
was
very
dignified
in
public
and
very
fond
in
private
,
gave
*NL*
convincing
proofs
of
the
truth
of
her
words

*NL*
``

It
would
break
my
heart

you
did

believe
that
I

gladly
pull
in

wo

paused

Laurie
had
received
many
compliments
in

life

never
one
that
*NL*
suited
him
better
,
as
he
plainly
showed
,
though
he
did
laugh
at
his
*NL*
wife
's
peculiar
taste
,

she
said
slowly
,

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Amy
looked
up
at

was
satisfied
;
her

fear
*NL*
vanished
forever
,

she
thanked
him

with

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Laurie
,
when
they
*NL*
began
to
pace
up

down
the

arm-in-arm

doing

There
's
one

of
poverty

that
I
particularly
like
to
help
.
Out-and-out
beggars
get
taken
care
of

*NL*

poor

fare
badly

because
they

knows
how

do
it

delicately

I
must
say
,
I
like
to
serve
a
decayed
gentleman
better
than
a
*NL*
blarneying
beggar
;
I
suppose
it
's
wrong
,

I
do
,
though
it
is
*NL*
harder

*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
it
takes
a
gentleman
to
do
it

added
the
other
member
of
the

domestic
admiration
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
I
'm
afraid
I
do

deserve
that
pretty
compliment

But
I
was
*NL*
going
to
say
that
while
I
was
dawdling
about
abroad
,
I
saw
a
good
many
*NL*
talented
young
fellows
making
all
sorts
of
sacrifices

and
enduring
real

hardships

that
they
might
realize

Splendid
fellows

some
*NL*
of
them

working
like
heroes
,
poor
and
friendless
,
but
so
full
of
*NL*
courage

patience

and
ambition
,
that
I
was
ashamed
of
myself
,
and
*NL*
longed
to
give
them
a
right
good
lift
.
Those
are
people
whom
it
's
a
*NL*
satisfaction
to
help
,
for
if
they
've
got
genius
,
it
's
an
honor
to
be
*NL*
allowed
to
serve
them
,
and
not
let
it
be
lost
or
delayed
for
want
of
*NL*
fuel
to
keep
the
pot
boiling
;
if
they
have
n't
,
it
's
a
pleasure
to
*NL*
comfort
the
poor
souls
,

keep
them
from
despair
when
they
find
it
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
;
and
there
's
another
class
who
ca
n't
ask

and
who
suffer
in
*NL*
silence
.
I
know
something
of
it
,
for
I
belonged
to
it
before
you
made
a
*NL*
princess
of
me
,
as
the
king
does
the
beggar-maid
in
the
old
story
.
*NL*
Ambitious
girls
have
a
hard
time
,
Laurie
,
and
often
have
to
see
youth
,
*NL*
health
,
and
precious
opportunities
go
by
,
just
for
want
of
a
little
help
*NL*
at
the
right
minute
.
People
have
been
very
kind
to
me
;
and
whenever
I
*NL*
see
girls
struggling
along
,
as
we
used
to
do
,
I
want
to
put
out
my
hand
*NL*
and
help
them
,
as
I
was
helped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
shall
,
like
an
angel
as
you
are

''
cried
Laurie
,
resolving
,
*NL*
with
a
glow
of
philanthropic
zeal
,
to
found
and
endow
an
institution
for
*NL*
the
express
benefit
of
young
women
with
artistic
tendencies
.
``
Rich
*NL*
people
have
no
right
to
sit
down
and
enjoy
themselves
,
or
let
their
*NL*
money
accumulate
for
others
to
waste
.
It
's
not
half
so
sensible
to
leave
*NL*
legacies
when
one
dies
as
it
is
to
use
the
money
wisely
while
alive
,
and
*NL*
enjoy
making
one
's
fellow-creatures
happy
with
it
.
We
'll
have
a
good
*NL*
time
ourselves
,
and
add
an
extra
relish
to
our
own
pleasure
by
giving
*NL*
other
people
a
generous
taste
.
Will
you
be
a
little
Dorcas
,
going
about
*NL*
emptying
a
big
basket
of
comforts
,
and
filling
it
up
with
good
deeds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
my
heart

if
you
will
be

gallantly

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
bargain

we
shall
get
the
best
of
it

*NL*
*NL*
So
the
young
pair
shook
hands
upon
it
,
and
then
paced
happily
on
again
,
*NL*
feeling
that
their
pleasant
home
was
more
home-like
because
they
hoped
*NL*
to
brighten
other
homes
,
believing
that
their
own
feet
would
walk
more
*NL*
uprightly
along
the
flowery
path
before
them
,
if
they
smoothed
rough
*NL*
ways
for
other
feet
,
and
feeling
that
their
hearts
were
more
closely
*NL*
knit
together
by
a
love
which
could
tenderly
remember
those
less
blest
*NL*
than
they

DAISY
AND
DEMI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
feel
that
I
have
done
my
duty
as
humble
historian
of
the
March
*NL*
family
,
without
devoting
at
least
one
chapter
to
the
two
most
precious
*NL*
and
important
members
of
it
.
Daisy
and
Demi
had
now
arrived
at
years
of
*NL*
discretion
;
for
in
this
fast
age
babies
of
three
or
four
assert
their
*NL*
rights
,
and
get
them
,
too
,
which
is
more
than
many
of
their
elders
do
.
*NL*
If
there
ever
were
a
pair
of
twins
in
danger
of
being
utterly
spoilt
by
*NL*
adoration
,
it
was
these
prattling
Brookes
.
Of
course
they
were
the
most
*NL*
remarkable
children
ever
born
,
as
will
be
shown
when
I
mention
that
they
*NL*
walked
at
eight
months
,
talked
fluently
at
twelve
months
,
and
at
two
*NL*
years
they
took
their
places
at
table
,
and
behaved
with
a
propriety
*NL*
which
charmed
all
beholders
.
At
three
,
Daisy
demanded
a
``
needler
,
''
and
*NL*
actually
made
a
bag
with
four
stitches
in
it
;
she
likewise
set
up
*NL*
housekeeping
in
the
sideboard
,
and
managed
a
microscopic
cooking-stove
*NL*
with
a
skill
that
brought
tears
of
pride
to
Hannah
's
eyes
,
while
Demi
*NL*
learned
his
letters
with
his
grandfather
,
who
invented
a
new
mode
of
*NL*
teaching
the
alphabet
by
forming
the
letters
with
his
arms
and
legs
,
*NL*
thus
uniting
gymnastics
for
head
and
heels
.
The
boy
early
developed
a
*NL*
mechanical
genius
which
delighted
his
father
and
distracted
his
mother
,
*NL*
for
he
tried
to
imitate
every
machine
he
saw
,
and
kept
the
nursery
in
a
*NL*
chaotic
condition
,
with
his
``
sewin-sheen
,
''
--
a
mysterious
structure
of
*NL*
string
,
chairs
,
clothes-pins
,
and
spools
,
for
wheels
to
go
``
wound
and
*NL*
wound
;
''
also
a
basket
hung
over
the
back
of
a
big
chair
,
in
which
he
*NL*
vainly
tried
to
hoist
his
too
confiding
sister
,
who
,
with
feminine
*NL*
devotion
,
allowed
her
little
head
to
be
bumped
till
rescued
,
when
the
*NL*
young
inventor
indignantly
remarked
,
``
Why
,
marmar
,
dat
's
my
lellywaiter
,
*NL*
and
me
's
trying
to
pull
her
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
utterly
unlike
in
character
,
the
twins
got
on
remarkably
well
*NL*
together
,
and
seldom
quarrelled
more
than
thrice
a
day
.
Of
course
,
Demi
*NL*
tyrannized
over
Daisy
,
and
gallantly
defended
her
from
every
other
*NL*
aggressor
;
while
Daisy
made
a
galley-slave
of
herself
,
and
adored
her
*NL*
brother
as
the
one
perfect
being
in
the
world
.
A
rosy
,
chubby
,
sunshiny
*NL*
little
soul
was
Daisy
,
who
found
her
way
to
everybody
's
heart
,
and
*NL*
nestled
there
.
One
of
the
captivating
children
,
who
seem
made
to
be
*NL*
kissed
and
cuddled
,
adorned
and
adored
like
little
goddesses
,
and
*NL*
produced
for
general
approval
on
all
festive
occasions
.
Her
small
*NL*
virtues
were
so
sweet
that
she
would
have
been
quite
angelic
if
a
few
*NL*
small
naughtinesses
had
not
kept
her
delightfully
human
.
It
was
all
fair
*NL*
weather
in
her
world
,
and
every
morning
she
scrambled
up
to
the
window
*NL*
in
her
little
night-gown
to
look
out
,
and
say
,
no
matter
whether
it
*NL*
rained
or
shone
,
``
Oh
,
pitty
day
,
oh
,
pitty
day
!
''
Every
one
was
a
friend
,
*NL*
and
she
offered
kisses
to
a
stranger
so
confidingly
that
the
most
*NL*
inveterate
bachelor
relented
,
and
baby-lovers
became
faithful
*NL*
worshippers
.

she
once
said

opening
her
arms
,
with
her
spoon
in
*NL*
one
hand
,
and
her
mug
in
the
other
,
as
if
eager
to
embrace

nourish
*NL*
the

As
she
grew
,
her
mother
began
to
feel
that
the
Dovecote
would
be
blest
*NL*
by
the
presence
of
an
inmate
as
serene
and
loving
as
that
which
had
*NL*
helped
to
make
the
old
house
home
,
and
to
pray
that
she
might
be
spared
*NL*
a
loss
like
that
which
had
lately
taught
them
how
long
they
had
*NL*
entertained
an
angel
unawares
.
Her
grandfather
often
called
her
``
Beth
,
''
*NL*
and
her
grandmother
watched
over
her
with
untiring
devotion
,
as
if
*NL*
trying
to
atone
for
some
past
mistake
,
which
no
eye
but
her
own
could
*NL*
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Demi
,
like
a
true
Yankee
,
was
of
an
inquiring
turn
,
wanting
to
know
*NL*
everything
,
and
often
getting
much
disturbed
because
he
could
not
get
*NL*
satisfactory
answers
to
his
perpetual
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
also
possessed
a
philosophic
bent
,
to
the
great
delight
of
his
*NL*
grandfather
,
who
used
to
hold
Socratic
conversations
with
him
,
in
which
*NL*
the
precocious
pupil
occasionally
posed
his
teacher
,
to
the
undisguised
*NL*
satisfaction
of
the
womenfolk
.

resting

took

Demi
felt

as
if
expecting

then
gravely

,

``

A
careful
explanation
followed
,
to
which
he
listened
so
attentively
that
*NL*
his
anxious
grandmother
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``

to
him

*NL*
Now
,
Demi
,
tell
me
where
you
keep
your
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
the
boy
had
replied
like
Alcibiades
,
``
By
the
gods
,
Socrates
,
I
can
not
*NL*
tell
,
''
his
grandfather
would
not
have
been
surprised
;
but
when
,
after
*NL*
standing
a
moment
on
one
leg
,
like
a
meditative
young
stork
,
he
*NL*
answered
,
in
a
tone
of
calm
conviction
,
``
In
my
little
belly
,
''
the
old
*NL*
gentleman
could
only
join
in
grandma
's
laugh
,
and
dismiss
the
class
in
*NL*
metaphysics
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
might
have
been
cause
for
maternal
anxiety
,
if
Demi
had
not
given
*NL*
convincing
proofs
that
he
was
a
true
boy
,
as
well
as
a
budding
*NL*
philosopher
;
for
,
often
,
after
a
discussion
which
caused
Hannah
to
*NL*
prophesy
,
with
ominous
nods
,
``
That
child
ai
n't
long
for
this
world
,
''
he
*NL*
would
turn
about
and
set
her
fears
at
rest
by
some
of
the
pranks
with
*NL*
which
dear
,
dirty
,
naughty
little
rascals
distract
and
delight
their
*NL*
parents
'
souls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meg
made
many
moral
rules
,
and
tried
to
keep
them
;
but
what
mother
was
*NL*
ever
proof
against
the
winning
wiles
,
the
ingenious
evasions
,
or
the
*NL*
tranquil
audacity
of
the
miniature
men
and
women
who
so
early
show
*NL*
themselves
accomplished
Artful

?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
raisins
,
Demi
,

'll
make

sick

''
says
mamma
to
the
young
*NL*
person
who
offers
his
services
in
the
kitchen
with
unfailing
regularity
*NL*
on
plum-pudding
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
He
reluctantly
departs
,
but
his
wrongs
weigh
upon
his
spirit
;
and
,
by
*NL*
and
by
,
when
an
opportunity
comes
to
redress
them
,
he
outwits
mamma
by
a
*NL*
shrewd
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

I
'll

anything

says
*NL*
Meg
,
as
she
leads
her
assistant
cooks
upstairs
,
when
the
pudding
is
*NL*
safely
bouncing
in
the
pot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

asks
Demi
,
with
a
brilliant
idea
in
his
well-powdered
*NL*
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
truly
;
anything
you
say

''
replies
the
short-sighted
parent
,
*NL*
preparing
herself
to
sing
``
The
Three
Little
Kittens
''
half
a
dozen
times
*NL*
over

or
to
take
her
family
to
``
Buy

penny
bun
,
''
regardless
of
wind
or
*NL*
limb
.
But
Demi
corners
her
by
the
cool
reply
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
we
'll
go
and
eat
up

*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Dodo
was
chief
playmate
and
_
confidante
_
of
both
children
,
and
the
*NL*
trio
turned
the
little
house
topsy-turvy
.
Aunt
Amy
was
as
yet
only
a
*NL*
name
to
them
,
Aunt
Beth
soon
faded
into
a
pleasantly
vague
memory
,
but
*NL*
Aunt
Dodo
was
a
living
reality
,
and
they
made
the
most
of
her
,
for
which
*NL*
compliment
she
was
deeply
grateful
.
But
when
Mr.
Bhaer
came
,
Jo
*NL*
neglected
her
playfellows
,
and
dismay
and
desolation
fell
upon
their
*NL*
little
souls
.
Daisy
,
who
was
fond
of
going
about
peddling
kisses
,
lost
*NL*
her
best
customer
and
became
bankrupt
;
Demi
,
with
infantile
penetration
,
*NL*
soon
discovered
that
Dodo
liked
to
play
with
``
the
bear-man
''
better
than
*NL*
she
did
with
him
;
but
,
though
hurt
,
he
concealed
his
anguish
,
for
he
*NL*
had
n't
the
heart
to
insult
a
rival
who
kept
a
mine
of
chocolate-drops
in
*NL*
his
waistcoat-pocket
,
and
a
watch
that
could
be
taken
out
of
its
case
*NL*
and
freely
shaken
by
ardent
admirers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
persons
might
have
considered
these
pleasing
liberties
as
bribes
;
*NL*
but
Demi
did
n't
see
it
in
that
light
,
and
continued
to
patronize
the
*NL*
``
bear-man
''
with
pensive
affability
,
while
Daisy
bestowed
her
small
*NL*
affections
upon
him
at
the
third
call
,
and
considered
his
shoulder
her
*NL*
throne
,
his
arm
her
refuge
,
his
gifts
treasures
of
surpassing
worth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gentlemen
are
sometimes
seized
with
sudden
fits
of
admiration
for
the
*NL*
young
relatives
of
ladies
whom
they
honor
with
their
regard
;
but
this
*NL*
counterfeit
philoprogenitiveness
sits
uneasily
upon
them
,
and
does
not
*NL*
deceive
anybody
a
particle
.
Mr.
Bhaer
's
devotion
was
sincere
,
however
*NL*
likewise
effective
,
--
for
honesty
is
the
best
policy
in
love
as
in
law
;
*NL*
he
was
one
of
the
men
who
are
at
home
with
children
,
and
looked
*NL*
particularly
well
when
little
faces
made
a
pleasant
contrast
with
his
*NL*
manly
one
.
His
business
,
whatever
it
was
,
detained
him
from
day
to
day
,
*NL*
but
evening
seldom
failed
to
bring
him
out
to
see
--
well
,
he
always
asked
*NL*
for
Mr.
March
,
so
I
suppose
_
he
_
was
the
attraction
.
The
excellent
papa
*NL*
labored
under
the
delusion
that
he
was
,
and
revelled
in
long
discussions
*NL*
with
the
kindred
spirit
,
till
a
chance
remark
of
his
more
observing
*NL*
grandson
suddenly
enlightened
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
came
in
one
evening
to
pause
on
the
threshold
of
the
study
,
*NL*
astonished
by
the
spectacle
that
met
his
eye
.
Prone
upon
the
floor
lay
*NL*
Mr.
March
,
with
his
respectable
legs
in
the
air
,
and
beside
him
,
*NL*
likewise
prone
,
was
Demi
,
trying
to
imitate
the
attitude
with
his
own
*NL*
short
,
scarlet-stockinged
legs
,
both
grovellers
so
seriously
absorbed
*NL*
that
they
were
unconscious
of
spectators
,
till
Mr.
Bhaer
laughed
his
*NL*
sonorous
laugh
,
and
Jo
cried
out
,
with
a
scandalized
face
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
,
father
,
here
's
the
Professor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Down
went
the
black
legs
and
up
came
the
gray
head
,
as
the
preceptor
*NL*
said
,
with
undisturbed
dignity
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good

Mr.
Bhaer

Excuse
me
for
a

;

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
and
,
after
a
few
convulsive
efforts
,
the
red
legs
took
*NL*
the
shape
of
a
pair
of
compasses
,
and
the
intelligent
pupil
triumphantly
*NL*
shouted
,
``

``

laughed
Jo
,
as
her
parent
gathered
himself
up
,
and
*NL*
her
nephew
tried
to
stand
on
his
head
,
as
the
only
mode
of
expressing
*NL*
his
satisfaction
that
school
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
been
at
to-day

''
asked
Mr.
Bhaer
,
picking
up
the
*NL*
gymnast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

*NL*
*NL*
``

began

,
with
artless
frankness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prut

thou
beginnest
early
.
What
did
the
little
Mary
say
to
that
?
''
*NL*
asked
Mr.
Bhaer
,
continuing
to
confess
the
young
sinner
,
who
stood
upon
*NL*
his
knee
,
exploring
the
waistcoat-pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
liked
it
,
and
she
kissed
me
,
and
I
liked
it
.
_
Do
n't
_

*NL*
boys
like

''
added
Demi
,
with
his
mouth
full
,
and
an
air
of
*NL*
bland
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
precocious
chick
!
Who
put
that
into
your
head
?
''
said
Jo
,
enjoying
*NL*
the
innocent
revelations
as
much
as
the
Professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
n't
in
mine
head
;
it
's
in
mine

,
''
answered
literal
Demi
,
*NL*
putting
out
his
tongue
,
with
a
chocolate-drop
on
it
,
thinking
she
*NL*
alluded
to
confectionery
,
not
ideas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thou
shouldst
save
some
for
the
little
friend
:
sweets
to
the
sweet

*NL*
mannling
;
''
and
Mr.
Bhaer
offered
Jo
some
,
with
a
look
that
made
her
*NL*
wonder
if
chocolate
was
not
the
nectar
drunk
by
the
gods
.
Demi
also
saw
*NL*
the
smile
,
was
impressed
by
it
,
and
artlessly
inquired
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
great
boys
like
great
girls
,
too

Fessor

''
*NL*
*NL*
Like
young
Washington
,
Mr.
Bhaer
``
could
n't
tell
a
lie
;
''
so
he
gave
the
*NL*
somewhat
vague
reply
that
he
believed
they
did
sometimes
,
in
a
tone
that
*NL*
made
Mr.
March
put
down
his
clothes-brush
,
glance
at
Jo
's
retiring
face
,
*NL*
and
then
sink
into
his
chair
,
looking
as
if
the
``
precocious
chick
''
had
*NL*
put
an
idea
into
_
his
_
head
that
was
both
sweet
and
sour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
Dodo
,
when
she
caught
him
in
the
china-closet
half
an
hour
*NL*
afterward
,
nearly
squeezed
the
breath
out
of
his
little
body
with
a
*NL*
tender
embrace
,
instead
of
shaking
him
for
being
there
,
and
why
she
*NL*
followed
up
this
novel
performance
by
the
unexpected
gift
of
a
big
slice
*NL*
of
bread
and
jelly
,
remained
one
of
the
problems
over
which
Demi
puzzled
*NL*
his
small
wits
,
and
was
forced
to
leave
unsolved
forever
.

While

were
taking
conjugal
strolls
over
velvet
carpets
,
*NL*
as
they
set
their
house
in
order

planned
a
blissful

Mr.
*NL*
Bhaer
and

were
enjoying
promenades
of
a
different
sort
,
along
muddy
*NL*
roads
and
sodden
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
do
take
a
walk
toward
evening
,
and
I
do
n't
know
why
I
should
*NL*
give
it
up
,
just
because
I
often
happen
to
meet
the
Professor
on
his
way
*NL*
out
,
''
said
Jo
to
herself
,
after
two
or
three
encounters
;
for
,
though
*NL*
there
were
two
paths
to
Meg
's
,
whichever
one
she
took
she
was
sure
to
*NL*
meet
him
,
either
going
or
returning
.
He
was
always
walking
rapidly
,
and
*NL*
never
seemed
to
see
her
till
quite
close
,
when
he
would
look
as
if
his
*NL*
short-sighted
eyes
had
failed
to
recognize
the
approaching
lady
till
*NL*
that
moment
.
Then
,
if
she
was
going
to
Meg
's
,
he
always
had
something
*NL*
for
the
babies
;
if
her
face
was
turned
homeward
,
he
had
merely
strolled
*NL*
down
to
see
the
river
,
and
was
just
about
returning
,
unless
they
were
*NL*
tired
of
his
frequent
calls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
circumstances
,
what
could
Jo
do
but
greet
him
civilly
,
and
*NL*
invite
him
in
?
If
she
_
was
_
tired
of
his
visits
,
she
concealed
her
*NL*
weariness
with
perfect
skill
,
and
took
care
that
there
should
be
coffee
*NL*
for
supper
,
``
as
Friedrich

I
mean
Mr.
Bhaer
--
does
n't

*NL*
*NL*
By
the
second
week
,
every
one
knew
perfectly
well
what
was
going
on
,
yet
*NL*
every
one
tried
to
look
as
if
they
were
stone-blind
to
the
changes
in
*NL*
Jo
's
face
.
They
never
asked
why
she
sang
about
her
work
,
did
up
her
hair
*NL*
three
times
a
day
,
and
got
so
blooming
with
her
evening
exercise
;
and
no
*NL*
one
seemed
to
have
the
slightest
suspicion
that
Professor
Bhaer
,
while
*NL*
talking
philosophy
with
the
father
,
was
giving
the
daughter
lessons
in
*NL*
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
could
n't
even
lose
her
heart
in
a
decorous
manner
,
but
sternly
tried
*NL*
to
quench
her
feelings
;
and
,
failing
to
do
so
,
led
a
somewhat
agitated
*NL*
life
.
She
was
mortally
afraid
of
being
laughed
at
for
surrendering
,
*NL*
after
her
many
and
vehement
declarations
of
independence
.
Laurie
was
her
*NL*
especial
dread
;
but
,
thanks
to
the
new
manager
,
he
behaved
with
*NL*
praiseworthy
propriety
,
never
called
Mr.
Bhaer
``
a
capital
old
fellow
''
in
*NL*
public
,
never
alluded
,
in
the
remotest
manner
,
to
Jo
's
improved
*NL*
appearance
,
or
expressed
the
least
surprise
at
seeing
the
Professor
's
*NL*
hat
on
the
Marches
'
hall-table
nearly
every
evening
.
But
he
exulted
in
*NL*
private
and
longed
for
the
time
to
come
when
he
could
give
Jo
a
piece
of
*NL*
plate
,
with
a
bear
and
a
ragged
staff
on
it
as
an
appropriate
*NL*
coat-of-arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
fortnight
,
the
Professor
came
and
went
with
lover-like
regularity
;
*NL*
then
he
stayed
away
for
three
whole
days
,
and
made
no
sign
,
--
a
*NL*
proceeding
which
caused
everybody
to
look
sober
,
and
Jo
to
become
*NL*
pensive
,
at
first
,
and
then
--
alas
for
romance
!
--
very
cross
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disgusted
,
I
dare
say
,
and
gone
home
as
suddenly
as
he
came
.
It
's
*NL*
nothing
to
me
,
of
course
;
but
I
_
should
_
think
he
would
have
come
and
*NL*
bid
us
good-by
,
like
a
gentleman

she
said
to
herself
,
with
a
*NL*
despairing
look
at
the
gate
,
as
she
put
on
her
things
for
the
customary
*NL*
walk
,
one
dull
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
better
take
the
little
umbrella
,
dear

it
looks

said
*NL*
her
mother
,
observing
that
she
had
on
her
new
bonnet
,
but
not
alluding
*NL*
to
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

returned
Jo
,
pulling
out
the
bow
under
her
chin
before
the
*NL*
glass
as
an
excuse
for
not
looking
at
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
want
some
twilled
silesia
,
a
paper
of
number
nine
needles
,
and
*NL*
two
yards
of
narrow
lavender
ribbon
.
Have
you
got
your
thick
boots
on
,
*NL*
and
something
warm
under
your
cloak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
,
''
answered
Jo
absently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
happen
to
meet
Mr.
Bhaer
,
bring
him
home
to
tea

I
quite
long
to
*NL*
see
the
dear
man

''
added
Mrs.
March
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
heard
_
that
_
,
but
made
no
answer
,
except
to
kiss
her
mother
,
and
walk
*NL*
rapidly
away
,
thinking
with
a
glow
of
gratitude
,
in
spite
of
her
*NL*
heartache
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
good
she
is
to
me
!
What
_
do
_
girls
do
who
have
n't
any
mothers
to
*NL*
help
them
through
their
troubles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dry-goods
stores
were
not
down
among
the
counting-houses
,
banks
,
and
*NL*
wholesale
warerooms
,
where
gentlemen
most
do
congregate
;
but
Jo
found
*NL*
herself
in
that
part
of
the
city
before
she
did
a
single
errand
,
*NL*
loitering
along
as
if
waiting
for
some
one
,
examining
engineering
*NL*
instruments
in
one
window
and
samples
of
wool
in
another
with
most
*NL*
unfeminine
interest
;
tumbling
over
barrels
,
being
half-smothered
by
*NL*
descending
bales
,
and
hustled
unceremoniously
by
busy
men
who
looked
as
*NL*
if
they
wondered
``
how
the
deuce
she
got
there
.
''
A
drop
of
rain
on
her
*NL*
cheek
recalled
her
thoughts
from
baffled
hopes
to
ruined
ribbons
;
for
*NL*
the
drops
continued
to
fall
,
and
,
being
a
woman
as
well
as
a
lover
,
she
*NL*
felt
that
,
though
it
was
too
late
to
save
her
heart
,
she
might
her
*NL*
bonnet
.
Now
she
remembered
the
little
umbrella
,
which
she
had
forgotten
*NL*
to
take
in
her
hurry
to
be
off
;
but
regret
was
unavailing
,
and
nothing
*NL*
could
be
done
but
borrow
one
or
submit
to
a
drenching
.
She
looked
up
at
*NL*
the
lowering
sky
,
down
at
the
crimson
bow
already
flecked
with
black
,
*NL*
forward
along
the
muddy
street
,
then
one
long
,
lingering
look
behind
,
at
*NL*
a
certain
grimy
warehouse
,
with
``
Hoffmann
,
Swartz
,
&
Co.
''
over
the
door
,
*NL*
and
said
to
herself
,
with
a
sternly
reproachful
air
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
serves
me
right
!
What
business
had
I
to
put
on
all
my
best
things
*NL*
and
come
philandering
down
here
,
hoping
to
see
the
Professor
?
Jo
,
I
'm
*NL*
ashamed
of
you
!
No
,
you
shall
_
not
_
go
there
to
borrow
an
umbrella
,
or
*NL*
find
out
where
he
is
,
from
his
friends
.
You
shall
trudge
away
,
and
do
*NL*
your
errands
in
the
rain
;
and
if
you
catch
your
death
and
ruin
your
*NL*
bonnet
,
it
's
no
more
than
you
deserve
.
Now
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
that
she
rushed
across
the
street
so
impetuously
that
she
narrowly
*NL*
escaped
annihilation
from
a
passing
truck
,
and
precipitated
herself
into
*NL*
the
arms
of
a
stately
old
gentleman
,
who
said
,
``
I
beg
pardon
,
ma'am
,
''
*NL*
and
looked
mortally
offended
.
Somewhat
daunted
,
Jo
righted
herself
,
*NL*
spread
her
handkerchief
over
the
devoted
ribbons
,
and
,
putting
*NL*
temptation
behind
her
,
hurried
on
,
with
increasing
dampness
about
the
*NL*
ankles
,
and
much
clashing
of
umbrellas
overhead
.
The
fact
that
a
*NL*
somewhat
dilapidated
blue
one
remained
stationary
above
the
unprotected
*NL*
bonnet
,
attracted
her
attention
;
and
,
looking
up
,
she
saw
Mr.
Bhaer
*NL*
looking
down
.

``

bravely
under

horse-noses

fast
through
much
mud
.
What
do
you
down
here
,
my
*NL*
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
shopping
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
smiled
,
as
he
glanced
from
the
pickle-factory
on
one
side
,
to
*NL*
the
wholesale
hide
and
leather
concern
on
the
other
;
but
he
only
said
*NL*
politely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
haf
no

May
I
go
also
,
and
take
for
you
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
thank
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
's
cheeks
were
as
red
as
her
ribbon
,
and
she
wondered
what
he
thought
*NL*
of
her
;
but
she
did
n't
care
,
for
in
a
minute
she
found
herself
walking
*NL*
away
arm-in-arm
with
her
Professor
,
feeling
as
if
the
sun
had
suddenly
*NL*
burst
out
with
uncommon
brilliancy
,
that
the
world
was
all
right
again
,
*NL*
and
that
one
thoroughly
happy
woman
was
paddling
through
the
wet
that
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
you
had
gone
,
''
said
Jo
hastily
,
for
she
knew
he
was
looking
*NL*
at
her
.
Her
bonnet
was
n't
big
enough
to
hide
her
face
,
and
she
feared
he
*NL*
might
think
the
joy
it
betrayed
unmaidenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
believe
that
I
should
go
with
no
farewell
to
those
who
haf
been
*NL*
so
heavenly
kind
to
me
?
''
he
asked
so
reproachfully
that
she
felt
as
if
*NL*
she
had
insulted
him
by
the
suggestion
,
and
answered
heartily
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
_
I
_
did
n't
;
I
knew
you
were
busy
about
your
own
affairs
,
but
we
*NL*
rather
missed
you
,

father
and
mother
especially
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
always
glad
to
see
you
,

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
anxiety
to
keep
her
voice
quite
calm
,
Jo
made
it
rather
cool
,
and
*NL*
the
frosty
little
monosyllable
at
the
end
seemed
to
chill
the
Professor
,
*NL*
for
his
smile
vanished
,
as
he
said
gravely
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thank
you
,
and
come
one
time
more
before
I
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Jo
,
for
the
bitterness
of
disappointment
*NL*
was
in
that
short
reply
of
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ought
to
think
so
,
for
I
haf
a
way
opened
to
me
by
which
I
can
make

my
bread

gif
my
Juenglings
much

*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
,
please
!
I
like
to
know
all
about
the

the

said
Jo
*NL*
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
so
kind
,
I
gladly
tell
you

My
friends
find
for
me
a
place
in
*NL*
a
college
,
where
I
teach
as
at
home
,
and
earn
enough
to
make
the
way
*NL*
smooth
for
Franz
and
Emil
.
For
this
I
should
be
grateful
,
should
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
should
.
How
splendid
it
will
be
to
have
you
doing
what
you
*NL*
like
,
and
be
able
to
see
you
often
,
and
the
boys
!
''
cried
Jo
,
clinging
to
*NL*
the
lads
as
an
excuse
for
the
satisfaction
she
could
not
help
betraying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
but
we
shall
not
meet
often
,
I
fear
;
this
place
is
at
the
West
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
away
!
''
and
Jo
left
her
skirts
to
their
fate
,
as
if
it
did
n't
*NL*
matter
now
what
became
of
her
clothes
or
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
could
read
several
languages
,
but
he
had
not
learned
to
read
*NL*
women
yet
.
He
flattered
himself
that
he
knew
Jo
pretty
well
,
and
was
,
*NL*
therefore
,
much
amazed
by
the
contradictions
of
voice
,
face
,
and
manner
,
*NL*
which
she
showed
him
in
rapid
succession
that
day
,
for
she
was
in
half
a
*NL*
dozen
different
moods
in
the
course
of
half
an
hour
.
When
she
met
him
*NL*
she
looked
surprised
,
though
it
was
impossible
to
help
suspecting
that
*NL*
she
had
come
for
that
express
purpose
.
When
he
offered
her
his
arm
,
she
*NL*
took
it
with
a
look
that
filled
him
with
delight
;
but
when
he
asked
if
*NL*
she
missed
him
,
she
gave
such
a
chilly
,
formal
reply
that
despair
fell
*NL*
upon
him
.
On
learning
his
good
fortune
she
almost
clapped
her
hands
:
was
*NL*
the
joy
all
for
the
boys
?
Then
,
on
hearing
his
destination
,
she
said
,
*NL*
``
So
far
away
!
''
in
a
tone
of
despair
that
lifted
him
on
to
a
pinnacle
of
*NL*
hope
;
but
the
next
minute
she
tumbled
him
down
again
by
observing
,
like
*NL*
one
entirely
absorbed
in
the
matter
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
place
for
my
errands
;
will
you
come
in
?
It
wo
n't
take
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
rather
prided
herself
upon
her
shopping
capabilities
,
and
*NL*
particularly
wished
to
impress
her
escort
with
the
neatness
and
despatch
*NL*
with
which
she
would
accomplish
the
business
.
But
,
owing
to
the
flutter
*NL*
she
was
in
,
everything
went
amiss
;
she
upset
the
tray
of
needles
,
forgot
*NL*
the
silesia
was
to
be
``
twilled
''
till
it
was
cut
off
,
gave
the
wrong
*NL*
change
,
and
covered
herself
with
confusion
by
asking
for
lavender
ribbon
*NL*
at
the
calico
counter
.
Mr.
Bhaer
stood
by
,
watching
her
blush
and
*NL*
blunder
;
and
,
as
he
watched
,
his
own
bewilderment
seemed
to
subside
,
*NL*
for
he
was
beginning
to
see
that
on
some
occasions
women
,
like
dreams
,
*NL*
go
by
contraries
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
out
,
he
put
the
parcel
under
his
arm
with
a
more
cheerful
*NL*
aspect
,
and
splashed
through
the
puddles
as
if
he
rather
enjoyed
it
,
on
*NL*
the
whole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
we
not
do
a
little
what
you
call
shopping
for
the
babies
,
and
*NL*
haf
a
farewell
feast
to-night
if
I
go
for
my
last
call
at
your
so
*NL*
pleasant
home
?
''
he
asked
,
stopping
before
a
window
full
of
fruit
and
*NL*
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
we
buy
?
''
said
Jo
,
ignoring
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
,
and
*NL*
sniffing
the
mingled
odors
with
an
affectation
of
delight
as
they
went
*NL*
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
they
haf
oranges
and
figs
?
''
asked
Mr.
Bhaer
,
with
a
paternal
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
eat
them
when
they
can
get
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
care
for
nuts
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
a
squirrel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hamburg
grapes
;
yes
,
we
shall
surely
drink
to
the
Fatherland
in
those
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
frowned
upon
that
piece
of
extravagance
,
and
asked
why
he
did
n't
buy
*NL*
a
frail
of
dates
,
a
cask
of
raisins
,
and
a
bag
of
almonds
,
and
done
with
*NL*
it
?
Whereat
Mr.
Bhaer
confiscated
her
purse
,
produced
his
own
,
and
*NL*
finished
the
marketing
by
buying
several
pounds
of
grapes
,
a
pot
of
rosy
*NL*
daisies
,
and
a
pretty
jar
of
honey
,
to
be
regarded
in
the
light
of
a
*NL*
demijohn
.
Then
,
distorting
his
pockets
with
the
knobby
bundles
,
and
*NL*
giving
her
the
flowers
to
hold
,
he
put
up
the
old
umbrella
,
and
they
*NL*
travelled
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Marsch
,
I
haf
a
great
favor
to
ask
of
you

began
the
Professor
,
*NL*
after
a
moist
promenade
of
half
a
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
''
and
Jo
's
heart
began
to
beat
so
hard
she
was
afraid
he
would
*NL*
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
bold
to
say
it
in
spite
of
the
rain

because
so
short
a
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

and
Jo
nearly
crushed
the
small
flower-pot
with
the
sudden
*NL*
squeeze
she
gave
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
get
a
little
dress

help

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

and
Jo
felt
as
calm
and
cool
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
as
if
she
had
*NL*
stepped
into
a
refrigerator
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

Yes

thick

warm

be
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll

added
Jo
to
herself
;
then
,
with
a
mental
*NL*
shake
,
she
entered
into
the
business
with
an
energy
which
was
pleasant
*NL*
to
behold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
left
it
all
to
her
,
so
she
chose
a
pretty
gown
for
Tina
,
and
*NL*
then
ordered
out
the
shawls
.
The
clerk
,
being
a
married
man
,
*NL*
condescended
to
take
an
interest
in
the
couple
,
who
appeared
to
be

shopping
for
their

*NL*
*NL*
``

throwing

it
,
''
answered
the
Professor
,
smiling
to
*NL*
himself
as
he
paid
for
it
,
while
Jo
continued
to
rummage
the
counters
*NL*
like
a
confirmed
bargain-hunter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
shall
we
go
home
?
''
he
asked
,
as
if
the
words
were
very
pleasant
to
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
it
's
late
,
and
I
'm
_
so
_
tired
.
''
Jo
's
voice
was
more
pathetic
than
*NL*
she
knew
;
for
now
the
sun
seemed
to
have
gone
in
as
suddenly
as
it
came
*NL*
out
,
the
world
grew
muddy
and
miserable
again
,
and
for
the
first
time
*NL*
she
discovered
that
her
feet
were
cold
,
her
head
ached
,
and
that
her
*NL*
heart
was
colder
than
the
former
,
fuller
of
pain
than
the
latter
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bhaer
was
going
away
;
he
only
cared
for
her
as
a
friend
;
it
was
all
a
*NL*
mistake
,
and
the
sooner
it
was
over
the
better
.
With
this
idea
in
her
*NL*
head
,
she
hailed
an
approaching
omnibus
with
such
a
hasty
gesture
that
*NL*
the
daisies
flew
out
of
the
pot
and
were
badly
damaged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
our
omniboos
,
''
said
the
Professor
,
waving
the
loaded
*NL*
vehicle
away
,
and
stopping
to
pick
up
the
poor
little
flowers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
I
did
n't
see
the
name
distinctly
.
Never
mind
,
I
can
*NL*
walk
.
I
'm
used
to
plodding
in
the
mud
,
''
returned
Jo
,
winking
hard
,
*NL*
because
she
would
have
died
rather
than
openly
wipe
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
saw
the
drops
on
her
cheeks
,
though
she
turned
her
head
away
;
*NL*
the
sight
seemed
to
touch
him
very
much
,
for
,
suddenly
stooping
down
,
he
*NL*
asked
in
a
tone
that
meant
a
great
deal
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heart
's
dearest
,
why
do
you
cry
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
,
if
Jo
had
not
been
new
to
this
sort
of
thing
she
would
have
said
*NL*
she
was
n't
crying
,
had
a
cold
in
her
head
,
or
told
any
other
feminine
*NL*
fib
proper
to
the
occasion
;
instead
of
which
that
undignified
creature
*NL*
answered
,
with
an
irrepressible
sob
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
you
are
going
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ach
,
mein
Gott
,
that
is
_
so
_
good
!
''
cried
Mr.
Bhaer
,
managing
to
clasp
*NL*
his
hands
in
spite
of
the
umbrella
and
the
bundles
.
``
Jo
,
I
haf
nothing
*NL*
but
much
love
to
gif
you
;
I
came
to
see
if
you
could
care
for
it
,
and
I
*NL*
waited
to
be
sure
that
I
was
something
more
than
a
friend
.
Am
I
?
Can
*NL*
you
make
a
little
place
in
your
heart
for
old
Fritz
?
''
he
added
,
all
in
*NL*
one
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
said
Jo
;
and
he
was
quite
satisfied
,
for
she
folded
both
*NL*
hands
over
his
arm
,
and
looked
up
at
him
with
an
expression
that
plainly
*NL*
showed
how
happy
she
would
be
to
walk
through
life
beside
him
,
even
*NL*
though
she
had
no
better
shelter
than
the
old
umbrella
,
if
he
carried
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
certainly
proposing
under
difficulties
,
for
,
even
if
he
had
*NL*
desired
to
do
so
,
Mr.
Bhaer
could
not
go
down
upon
his
knees
,
on
account
*NL*
of
the
mud
;
neither
could
he
offer
Jo
his
hand
,
except
figuratively
,
for
*NL*
both
were
full
;
much
less
could
he
indulge
in
tender
demonstrations
in
*NL*
the
open
street
,
though
he
was
near
it
:
so
the
only
way
in
which
he
*NL*
could
express
his
rapture
was
to
look
at
her
,
with
an
expression
which
*NL*
glorified
his
face
to
such
a
degree
that
there
actually
seemed
to
be
*NL*
little
rainbows
in
the
drops
that
sparkled
on
his
beard
.
If
he
had
not
*NL*
loved
Jo
very
much
,
I
do
n't
think
he
could
have
done
it
_
then
_
,
for
she
*NL*
looked
far
from
lovely
,
with
her
skirts
in
a
deplorable
state
,
her
*NL*
rubber
boots
splashed
to
the
ankle
,
and
her
bonnet
a
ruin
.
Fortunately
,
*NL*
Mr.
Bhaer
considered
her
the
most
beautiful
woman
living
,
and
she
found
*NL*
him
more
``
Jove-like
''
than
ever
,
though
his
hat-brim
was
quite
limp
with
*NL*
the
little
rills
trickling
thence
upon
his
shoulders
-LRB-
for
he
held
the
*NL*
umbrella
all
over
Jo
-RRB-
,
and
every
finger
of
his
gloves
needed
mending
.
*NL*
*NL*
Passers-by
probably
thought
them
a
pair
of
harmless
lunatics
,
for
they
*NL*
entirely
forgot
to
hail
a
`
bus
,
and
strolled
leisurely
along
,
oblivious
*NL*
of
deepening
dusk
and
fog
.
Little
they
cared
what
anybody
thought
,
for
*NL*
they
were
enjoying
the
happy
hour
that
seldom
comes
but
once
in
any
*NL*
life
,
the
magical
moment
which
bestows
youth
on
the
old
,
beauty
on
the
*NL*
plain
,
wealth
on
the
poor
,
and
gives
human
hearts
a
foretaste
of
heaven
.
*NL*
The
Professor
looked
as
if
he
had
conquered
a
kingdom
,
and
the
world
had
*NL*
nothing
more
to
offer
him
in
the
way
of
bliss
;
while
Jo
trudged
beside
*NL*
him
,
feeling
as
if
her
place
had
always
been
there
,
and
wondering
how
*NL*
she
ever
could
have
chosen
any
other
lot
.
Of
course
,
she
was
the
first
*NL*
to
speak
--
intelligibly
,
I
mean
,
for
the
emotional
remarks
which
followed
*NL*
her
impetuous
``
Oh
,
yes
!
''
were
not
of
a
coherent
or
reportable
*NL*
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friedrich
,
why
did
n't
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
heaven
,
she
gifs
me
the
name
that
no
one
speaks
since
Minna
died
!
''
*NL*
cried
the
Professor
,
pausing
in
a
puddle
to
regard
her
with
grateful
*NL*
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
call
you
so
to
myself
--
I
forgot
;
but
I
wo
n't
,
unless
you
like

it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
it

it
is
more
sweet
to
me
than
I
can
tell
.
Say
`
thou
,
'
also
,
and
*NL*
I
shall
say
your
language
is
almost
as
beautiful
as
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
`
thou
'
a
little
sentimental
?
''
asked
Jo
,
privately
thinking
it
a
*NL*
lovely
monosyllable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sentimental
?
Yes
.
Thank
Gott
,
we
Germans
believe
in
sentiment
,
and
keep
*NL*
ourselves
young
mit
it
.
Your
English
`
you
'
is
so
cold
,
say
`
thou
,
'
*NL*
heart
's
dearest
,
it
means
so
much
to
me
,
''
pleaded
Mr.
Bhaer
,
more
like
a
*NL*
romantic
student
than
a
grave
professor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
why
did
n't
thou
tell
me
all
this
sooner
?
''
asked
Jo
*NL*
bashfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
shall
haf
to
show
thee
all
my
heart
,
and
I
so
gladly
will
,
*NL*
because
thou
must
take
care
of
it
hereafter
.
See
,
then
,
my
Jo
,
--
ah
,
the
*NL*
dear
,
funny
little
name
!
--
I
had
a
wish
to
tell
something
the
day
I
said
*NL*
good-by
,
in
New
York
;
but
I
thought
the
handsome
friend
was
betrothed
to
*NL*
thee
,
and
so
I
spoke
not
.
Wouldst
thou
have
said
`
Yes
,
'
then
,
if
I
_
had
_
*NL*
spoken
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
'm
afraid
not
,
for
I
did
n't
have
any
heart
just
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prut
!
that
I
do
not
believe
.
It
was
asleep
till
the
fairy
prince
came
*NL*
through
the
wood
,
and
waked
it
up
.
Ah
,
well
,
`
Die
erste
Liebe
ist
die
*NL*
beste

but
that
I
should
not
expect
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

the

is

the
best

so
be
contented
,
for
I
never
had
*NL*
another

Teddy

only
a
boy

and
soon
got
over
his
little
fancy

''
said
*NL*
Jo
,
anxious
to
correct
the
Professor
's
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
!
then
I
shall
rest
happy
,
and
be
sure
that
thou
givest
me
all
.
I
*NL*

long

selfish

wilt
find

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
that

cried
Jo
,
delighted
with
her
new
name
.
``
Now
tell
me
what
*NL*
brought
you
,
at
last
,
just
when
I
most
wanted
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
;
''
and
Mr.
Bhaer
took
a
little
worn
paper
out
of
his
*NL*
waistcoat-pocket
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
unfolded
it
,
and
looked
much
abashed
,
for
it
was
one
of
her
own
*NL*
contributions
to
a
paper
that
paid
for
poetry
,
which
accounted
for
her
*NL*
sending
it
an
occasional
attempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
that
bring
you
?
''
she
asked
,
wondering
what
he
meant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
it
by
chance
;
I
knew
it
by
the
names
and
the
initials
,
and
in
*NL*
it
there
was
one
little
verse
that
seemed
to
call
me
.
Read
and
find
him
;
*NL*
I
will
see
that
you
go
not
in

wet

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
obeyed
,

hastily
skimmed
through
the

had

christened

one
day

very
lonely

had
a
good
cry
on

I
never
thought

go

tell

said
Jo
,
tearing
up
the
verses
the
*NL*
Professor
had
treasured
so
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
go

it
has
done

haf
a

said
Mr.
*NL*
Bhaer
,
with
a
smile
,
as
he
watched
the
fragments
fly
away
on
the
wind
.
*NL*
``
Yes

he
added
earnestly
,
``
I
read
that

whispered
Jo
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
no

soon
I
began
to

I
said

cried
Mr.

,
with
a
defiant
*NL*
nod
,
as
if
the
walls
of
mist
closing
round

were
barriers
which
he
*NL*
was
to
surmount

knock
down

*NL*
*NL*
Jo
thought
that
was
splendid

resolved

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
made

she
asked
presently

finding
it
so

pleasant
to
ask
confidential
questions

get
delightful
answers
that
*NL*
she
could
not
keep
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not
easy

I

could
haf
a
prospect
of

give
you

I
ask

up

decidedly

adding
,
in
a
softer
tone

``
Do

The
Professor
found
that
so
touching
that
he
would
have
been
glad
of
his
*NL*
handkerchief
,
if
he
could
have
got
at

Jo
wiped
his

eyes
for
him

said

laughing
,
as

took
away
a
bundle

two
,

*NL*
*NL*

added
resolutely

*NL*

quite

*NL*
Jo
never

never
would
learn
to
be

for
when
he
said
that
as
they
*NL*
stood
upon

steps

she
just
put
both

into

whispering

tenderly
,
``

,
stooping
down

kissed
her
Friedrich

under

was
dreadful

she
would
have
done
it
if
the
*NL*
flock
of
draggle-tailed
sparrows
on

hedge
had
been

for
*NL*
she
was
very
far
gone
indeed

and
quite
regardless
of
everything

her
*NL*
own
happiness
.
Though
it
came
in
such
a
very
simple
guise

that
was
the
*NL*
crowning
moment
of
both
their
lives

light

peace
waiting

Jo
led

in

HARVEST

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
year
Jo
and
her
Professor
worked
and
waited
,
hoped
and
loved
,
met
*NL*
occasionally
,
and
wrote
such
voluminous
letters
that
the
rise
in
the
*NL*
price
of
paper
was
accounted
for
,
Laurie
said
.
The
second
year
began
*NL*
rather
soberly
,
for
their
prospects
did
not
brighten
,
and
Aunt
March
*NL*
died
suddenly
.
But
when
their
first
sorrow
was
over
,
--
for
they
loved
the
*NL*
old
lady
in
spite
of
her
sharp
tongue
,
--
they
found
they
had
cause
for
*NL*
rejoicing
,
for
she
had
left
Plumfield
to
Jo
,
which
made
all
sorts
of
*NL*
joyful
things
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
fine
old
place
,
and
will
bring
a
handsome
sum
;
for
of
course
you
*NL*
intend
to
sell
it
,
''
said
Laurie
,
as
they
were
all
talking
the
matter
*NL*
over
,
some
weeks
later
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
,
''
was
Jo
's
decided
answer
,
as
she
petted
the
fat
poodle
,
*NL*
whom
she
had
adopted
,
out
of
respect
to
his
former
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
to
live
there

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
my
dear
girl

it

an
immense
house

and
will
take
a
power
of
*NL*
money
to
keep
it
in
order
.
The
garden
and
orchard
alone
need
two
or
*NL*
three
men
,
and
farming
is
n't
in
Bhaer

line

I
take
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'll
try
his

at
it
there

propose
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
expect
to
live
on

produce

Well

that
sounds

paradisiacal

you
'll
find
it
desperate

work

*NL*
``
The
crop
we
are
going
to
raise
is
a
profitable

Jo
laughed

Of
what
is
this
fine
crop
to
consist

*NL*

cried
*NL*
Laurie
,
appealing
to
the
family

who
looked
as
much
surprised
as
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it

said
Mrs.
March
decidedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
do
I
,

added
her
husband
,
who
welcomed
the
thought
of
a
chance
for
*NL*
trying
the
Socratic
method
of
education
on
modern
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
an
immense
care
for
Jo

said
Meg
,
stroking
the
head
of
her
*NL*
one
all-absorbing
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jo
can
do

about

cried
Mr.
Laurence
,
who
had
been
longing
to
lend
the
lovers
a

hand
,

knew
that
they

refuse

*NL*
*NL*

she
prudently
waits
to
turn

over
in
her
mind
before
she
*NL*
speaks

Now
,
my
dear
people

''
continued
Jo
earnestly
,
``
just
understand
*NL*
that
this
is
n't
a
new
idea

but
a
long-cherished

Before
my
*NL*
Fritz
came
,
I
used
to
think
how
,
when
I
'd
made
my
fortune

and
no
one

needed
me
at
home

I
'd
hire

pick
up
some
poor

forlorn

little
lads

who
had
n't
any
mothers

and
take
care
of
them

and
make

life
jolly
for
them

it
was
too

I
see
so
many
going
to

for

of

at

right

I
love
so
to
do
anything
for

seem

troubles

should

like

be

Mrs.
March
held
out
her
hand
to
Jo
,
who
took
it
,
smiling
,
with
tears
in
*NL*
her
eyes
,
and
went
on
in
the
old
enthusiastic
way
,
which
they
had
not
*NL*
seen
for
a
long
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
told
my
plan
to
Fritz
once

and
he
said
it
was
just
what
he
would
*NL*
like
,
and
agreed
to
try
it
when
we
got
rich
.
Bless
his
dear
heart
,
he
's
*NL*
been
doing
it
all
his
life
,
--
helping
poor

,
I
mean

not
getting
*NL*
rich

that
he
'll
never
be

money
does
n't
stay
in

pocket
long
enough

lay
up
any

But
now
,
thanks
to
my
good
old
aunt

who
loved
me
better
*NL*
than
I
ever
deserved

_
I
'm

rich

at

I
feel
so
,
and
we
can
live
at
*NL*
Plumfield
perfectly
well
,
if
we
have
a
flourishing
school
.
It
's
just
the
*NL*
place
for
boys

the
house
is
big

and
the
furniture
strong

plain

*NL*
There
's
plenty
of
room
for
dozens
inside
,
and
splendid
grounds
outside
.
*NL*
They
could
help
in
the
garden
and
orchard
:
such
work
is
healthy
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
,
sir
?
Then
Fritz
can
train
and
teach
in
his
own
way
,
and
father
will
*NL*
help
him
.
I
can
feed
and
nurse
and
pet
and
scold
them
;

mother
will
*NL*
be
my
stand-by

I
've
always
longed
for
lots
of
boys

never
had
*NL*
enough
;
now
I
can
fill
the
house
full

and
revel
in
the
little
dears
to
*NL*
my
heart

content

Think
what
luxury

Plumfield
my

and
a

wilderness

to
enjoy
it
with

As
Jo
waved
her
hands

gave
a
sigh

rapture

the

went
off

into
a
gale

merriment

plucky
*NL*
little
souls
,
--
but
they
feel
it
.
I
've
been
through
something
of
it
,
and
*NL*
I
know
all
about
it
.
I
've
a
special
interest
in
such
young
bears
,
and
*NL*
like
to
show
them
that
I
see
the
warm
,
honest
,
well-meaning
boys
'
*NL*
hearts
,
in
spite
of
the
clumsy
arms
and
legs
and
the
topsy-turvy
heads
.
*NL*
I
've
had
experience
,
too
,
for
have
n't
I
brought
up
one
boy
to
be
a
pride
*NL*
and
honor
to
his
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
testify
that
you
tried
to
do
it
,
''
said
Laurie
,
with
a
grateful
*NL*
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
've
succeeded
beyond
my
hopes
;
for
here
you
are
,
a
steady
,
*NL*
sensible
business
man
,
doing
heaps
of
good
with
your
money
,
and
laying
*NL*
up
the
blessings
of
the
poor
,
instead
of
dollars
.
But
you
are
not
merely
*NL*
a
business
man
:
you
love
good
and
beautiful
things
,
enjoy
them
yourself
,
*NL*
and
let
others
go
halves
,
as
you
always
did
in
the
old
times
.
I
_
am
_
*NL*
proud
of
you
,
Teddy
,
for
you
get
better
every
year
,
and
every
one
feels
*NL*
it
,
though
you
wo
n't
let
them
say
so
.
Yes
,
and
when
I
have
my
flock
,
*NL*
I
'll
just
point
to
you
,
and
say
,
`
There
's
your
model
,
my
lads
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Laurie
did
n't
know
where
to
look
;
for
,
man
though
he
was
,
something
*NL*
of
the
old
bashfulness
came
over
him
as
this
burst
of
praise
made
all
*NL*
faces
turn
approvingly
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
Jo
,
that
's
rather
too
much
,
''
he
began
,
just
in
his
old
boyish
*NL*
way
.
``
You
have
all
done
more
for
me
than
I
can
ever
thank
you
for
,
*NL*
except
by
doing
my
best
not
to
disappoint
you
.
You
have
rather
cast
me
*NL*
off
lately
,
Jo
,
but
I
've
had
the
best
of
help
,
nevertheless
;
so
,
if
I
've
*NL*
got
on
at
all
,
you
may
thank
these
two
for
it
;
''
and
he
laid
one
hand
*NL*
gently
on
his
grandfather
's
white
head
,
the
other
on
Amy
's
golden
one
,
*NL*
for
the
three
were
never
far
apart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
think
that
families
are
the
most
beautiful
things
in
all
the
*NL*
world
!
''
burst
out
Jo
,
who
was
in
an
unusually
uplifted
frame
of
mind
*NL*
just
then
.
``
When
I
have
one
of
my
own
,
I
hope
it
will
be
as
happy
as
the
*NL*
three
I
know
and
love
the
best
.
If
John
and
my
Fritz
were
only
here
,
it
*NL*
would
be
quite
a
little
heaven
on
earth
,
''
she
added
more
quietly
.
And
*NL*
that
night
,
when
she
went
to
her
room
,
after
a
blissful
evening
of
*NL*
family
counsels
,
hopes
,
and
plans
,
her
heart
was
so
full
of
happiness
*NL*
that
she
could
only
calm
it
by
kneeling
beside
the
empty
bed
always
near
*NL*
her
own
,
and
thinking
tender
thoughts
of
Beth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
astonishing
year
altogether
,
for
things
seemed
to
happen
*NL*
in
an
unusually
rapid
and
delightful
manner
.
Almost
before
she
knew
*NL*
where
she
was
,
Jo
found
herself
married
and
settled
at
Plumfield
.
Then
a
*NL*
family
of
six
or
seven
boys
sprung
up
like
mushrooms
,
and
flourished
*NL*
surprisingly
,
poor
boys
as
well
as
rich
;
for
Mr.
Laurence
was
*NL*
continually
finding
some
touching
case
of
destitution
,
and
begging
the
*NL*
Bhaers
to
take
pity
on
the
child
,
and
he
would
gladly
pay
a
trifle
for
*NL*
its
support
.
In
this
way
the
sly
old
gentleman
got
round
proud
Jo
,
and
*NL*
furnished
her
with
the
style
of
boy
in
which
she
most
delighted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
it
was
up-hill
work
at
first
,
and
Jo
made
queer
mistakes
;
but
*NL*
the
wise
Professor
steered
her
safely
into
calmer
waters
,
and
the
most
*NL*
rampant
ragamuffin
was
conquered
in
the
end
.
How
Jo
did
enjoy
her
*NL*
``
wilderness
of
boys
,
''
and
how
poor
,
dear
Aunt
March
would
have
lamented
*NL*
had
she
been
there
to
see
the
sacred
precincts
of
prim
,
well-ordered
*NL*
Plumfield
overrun
with
Toms
,
Dicks
,
and
Harrys
!
There
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
poetic
justice
about
it
,
after
all
,
for
the
old
lady
had
been
the
terror
*NL*
of
the
boys
for
miles
round
;
and
now
the
exiles
feasted
freely
on
*NL*
forbidden
plums
,
kicked
up
the
gravel
with
profane
boots
unreproved
,
and
*NL*
played
cricket
in
the
big
field
where
the
irritable
``
cow
with
a
crumpled
*NL*
horn
''
used
to
invite
rash
youths
to
come
and
be
tossed
.
It
became
a
sort
*NL*
of
boys
'
paradise
,
and
Laurie
suggested
that
it
should
be
called
the
*NL*
``
Bhaer-garten
,
''
as
a
compliment
to
its
master
and
appropriate
to
its
*NL*
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
never
was
a
fashionable
school
,
and
the
Professor
did
not
lay
up
a
*NL*
fortune
;
but
it
_
was
_
just
what
Jo
intended
it
to
be
,
--
``
a
happy
,
*NL*
homelike
place
for
boys
,
who
needed
teaching
,
care
,
and
kindness
.
''
*NL*
Every
room
in
the
big
house
was
soon
full
;
every
little
plot
in
the
*NL*
garden
soon
had
its
owner
;
a
regular
menagerie
appeared
in
barn
and
*NL*
shed
,
for
pet
animals
were
allowed
;
and
,
three
times
a
day
,
Jo
smiled
at
*NL*
her
Fritz
from
the
head
of
a
long
table
lined
on
either
side
with
rows
*NL*
of
happy
young
faces
,
which
all
turned
to
her
with
affectionate
eyes
,
*NL*
confiding
words
,
and
grateful
hearts
,
full
of
love
for
``
Mother
Bhaer
.
''
*NL*
She
had
boys
enough
now
,
and
did
not
tire
of
them
,
though
they
were
not
*NL*
angels
,
by
any
means
,
and
some
of
them
caused
both
Professor
and
*NL*
Professorin
much
trouble
and
anxiety
.
But
her
faith
in
the
good
spot
*NL*
which
exists
in
the
heart
of
the
naughtiest
,
sauciest
,
most
tantalizing
*NL*
little
ragamuffin
gave
her
patience
,
skill
,
and
,
in
time
,
success
;
for
*NL*
no
mortal
boy
could
hold
out
long
with
Father
Bhaer
shining
on
him
as
*NL*
benevolently
as
the
sun
,
and
Mother
Bhaer
forgiving
him
seventy
times
*NL*
seven
.
Very
precious
to
Jo
was
the
friendship
of
the
lads
;
their
*NL*
penitent
sniffs
and
whispers
after
wrong-doing
;
their
droll
or
touching
*NL*
little
confidences
;
their
pleasant
enthusiasms
,
hopes
,
and
plans
;
even
*NL*
their
misfortunes
,
for
they
only
endeared
them
to
her
all
the
more
.
*NL*
There
were
slow
boys
and
bashful
boys
;
feeble
boys
and
riotous
boys
;
*NL*
boys
that
lisped
and
boys
that
stuttered
;
one
or
two
lame
ones
;
and
a
*NL*
merry
little
quadroon
,
who
could
not
be
taken
in
elsewhere
,
but
who
was
*NL*
welcome
to
the
``
Bhaer-garten
,
''
though
some
people
predicted
that
his
*NL*
admission
would
ruin
the
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
;
Jo
was
a
very
happy
woman
there
,
in
spite
of
hard
work
,
much
*NL*
anxiety
,
and
a
perpetual
racket
.
She
enjoyed
it
heartily
,
and
found
the
*NL*
applause
of
her
boys
more
satisfying
than
any
praise
of
the
world
;
for
*NL*
now
she
told
no
stories
except
to
her
flock
of
enthusiastic
believers
*NL*
and
admirers
.
As
the
years
went
on
,
two
little
lads
of
her
own
came
to
*NL*
increase
her
happiness
,
--
Rob
,
named
for
grandpa
,
and
Teddy
,
a
*NL*
happy-go-lucky
baby
,
who
seemed
to
have
inherited
his
papa
's
sunshiny
*NL*
temper
as
well
as
his
mother
's
lively
spirit
.
How
they
ever
grew
up
*NL*
alive
in
that
whirlpool
of
boys
was
a
mystery
to
their
grandma
and
*NL*
aunts
;
but
they
flourished
like
dandelions
in
spring
,
and
their
rough
*NL*
nurses
loved
and
served
them
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
a
great
many
holidays
at
Plumfield
,
and
one
of
the
most
*NL*
delightful
was
the
yearly
apple-picking
;
for
then
the
Marches
,
*NL*
Laurences
,
Brookes
,
and
Bhaers
turned
out
in
full
force
,
and
made
a
day
*NL*
of
it
.
Five
years
after
Jo
's
wedding
,
one
of
these
fruitful
festivals
*NL*
occurred
,
--
a
mellow
October
day
,
when
the
air
was
full
of
an
*NL*
exhilarating
freshness
which
made
the
spirits
rise
,
and
the
blood
dance
*NL*
healthily
in
the
veins
.
The
old
orchard
wore
its
holiday
attire
;
*NL*
golden-rod
and
asters
fringed
the
mossy
walls
;
grasshoppers
skipped
*NL*
briskly
in
the
sere
grass
,
and
crickets
chirped
like
fairy
pipers
at
a
*NL*
feast
;
squirrels
were
busy
with
their
small
harvesting
;
birds
twittered
*NL*
their
adieux
from
the
alders
in
the
lane
;
and
every
tree
stood
ready
to
*NL*
send
down
its
shower
of
red
or
yellow
apples
at
the
first
shake
.
*NL*
Everybody
was
there
;
everybody
laughed
and
sang
,
climbed
up
and
tumbled
*NL*
down
;
everybody
declared
that
there
never
had
been
such
a
perfect
day
or
*NL*
such
a
jolly
set
to
enjoy
it
;
and
every
one
gave
themselves
up
to
the
*NL*
simple
pleasures
of
the
hour
as
freely
as
if
there
were
no
such
things
*NL*
as
care
or
sorrow
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
March
strolled
placidly
about
,
quoting
Tusser
,
Cowley
,
and
Columella
*NL*
to
Mr.
Laurence
,
while
enjoying
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
gentle
apple
's
winey
juice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Professor
charged
up
and
down
the
green
aisles
like
a
stout
Teutonic
*NL*
knight
,
with
a
pole
for
a
lance
,
leading
on
the
boys
,
who
made
a
hook
*NL*
and
ladder
company
of
themselves
,
and
performed
wonders
in
the
way
of
*NL*
ground
and
lofty
tumbling
.
Laurie
devoted
himself
to
the
little
ones
,
*NL*
rode
his
small
daughter
in
a
bushel-basket
,
took
Daisy
up
among
the
*NL*
birds
'
nests
,
and
kept
adventurous
Rob
from
breaking
his
neck
.
Mrs.
*NL*
March
and
Meg
sat
among
the
apple
piles
like
a
pair
of
Pomonas
,
sorting
*NL*
the
contributions
that
kept
pouring
in
;
while
Amy
,
with
a
beautiful
*NL*
motherly
expression
in
her
face
,
sketched
the
various
groups
,
and
*NL*
watched
over
one
pale
lad
,
who
sat
adoring
her
with
his
little
crutch
*NL*
beside
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jo
was
in
her
element
that
day
,
and
rushed
about
,
with
her
gown
pinned
*NL*
up
,
her
hat
anywhere
but
on
her
head
,
and
her
baby
tucked
under
her
arm
,
*NL*
ready
for
any
lively
adventure
which
might
turn
up
.
Little
Teddy
bore
a
*NL*
charmed
life
,
for
nothing
ever
happened
to
him
,
and
Jo
never
felt
any
*NL*
anxiety
when
he
was
whisked
up
into
a
tree
by
one
lad
,
galloped
off
on
*NL*
the
back
of
another
,
or
supplied
with
sour
russets
by
his
indulgent
*NL*
papa
,
who
labored
under
the
Germanic
delusion
that
babies
could
digest
*NL*
anything
,
from
pickled
cabbage
to
buttons
,
nails
,
and
their
own
small
*NL*
shoes
.
She
knew
that
little
Ted
would
turn
up
again
in
time
,
safe
and
*NL*
rosy
,
dirty
and
serene
,
and
she
always
received
him
back
with
a
hearty
*NL*
welcome
,
for
Jo
loved
her
babies
tenderly
.

At
four
o'clock
a
lull
took
place
,
and
baskets
remained
empty
,
while
the
*NL*
apple-pickers
rested
,
and
compared
rents
and
bruises
.
Then
Jo
and
Meg
,
*NL*
with
a
detachment
of
the
bigger
boys
,
set
forth
the
supper
on
the
grass
,
*NL*
for
an
out-of-door
tea
was
always
the
crowning
joy
of
the
day
.
The
land
*NL*
literally
flowed
with
milk
and
honey
on
such
occasions
,
for
the
lads
*NL*
were
not
required
to
sit
at
table
,
but
allowed
to
partake
of
refreshment
*NL*
as
they
liked
,
--
freedom
being
the
sauce
best
beloved
by
the
boyish
soul
.
*NL*
They
availed
themselves
of
the
rare
privilege
to
the
fullest
extent
,
for
*NL*
some
tried
the
pleasing
experiment
of
drinking
milk
while
standing
on
*NL*
their
heads
,
others
lent
a
charm
to
leap-frog
by
eating
pie
in
the
*NL*
pauses
of
the
game
,
cookies
were
sown
broadcast
over
the
field
,
and
*NL*
apple-turnovers
roosted
in
the
trees
like
a
new
style
of
bird
.
The
*NL*
little
girls
had
a
private
tea-party
,
and
Ted
roved
among
the
edibles
at
*NL*
his
own
sweet
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
no
one
could
eat
any
more
,
the
Professor
proposed
the
first
regular
*NL*
toast
,
which
was
always
drunk
at
such
times
,
--
``
Aunt
March
,
God
bless
*NL*
her
!
''
A
toast
heartily
given
by
the
good
man
,
who
never
forgot
how
much
*NL*
he
owed
her
,
and
quietly
drunk
by
the
boys
,
who
had
been
taught
to
*NL*
keep
her
memory
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
grandma
's
sixtieth
birthday
!
Long
life
to
her
,
with
three
times
*NL*
three
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
given
with
a
will
,
as
you
may
well
believe
;
and
the
cheering
*NL*
once
begun
,
it
was
hard
to
stop
it
.
Everybody
's
health
was
proposed
,
*NL*
from
Mr.
Laurence
,
who
was
considered
their
special
patron
,
to
the
*NL*
astonished
guinea-pig
,
who
had
strayed
from
its
proper
sphere
in
search
*NL*
of
its
young
master
.
Demi
,
as
the
oldest
grandchild
,
then
presented
the
*NL*
queen
of
the
day
with
various
gifts
,
so
numerous
that
they
were
*NL*
transported
to
the
festive
scene
in
a
wheelbarrow
.
Funny
presents
,
some
*NL*
of
them
,
but
what
would
have
been
defects
to
other
eyes
were
ornaments
*NL*
to
grandma
's
,
--
for
the
children
's
gifts
were
all
their
own
.
Every
stitch
*NL*
Daisy
's
patient
little
fingers
had
put
into
the
handkerchiefs
she
hemmed
*NL*
was
better
than
embroidery
to
Mrs.
March
;
Demi
's
shoe-box
was
a
miracle

skill
,

would

;
Rob
's
footstool
had
*NL*
a
wiggle
in
its
uneven
legs
,
that
she
declared
was
very
soothing
;
and
no
*NL*
page
of
the
costly
book
Amy
's
child
gave
her
was
so
fair
as
that
on
*NL*
which
appeared
,
in
tipsy
capitals
,
the
words
,
--
``
To
dear
Grandma
,
from
*NL*
her
little
Beth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
this
ceremony
the
boys
had
mysteriously
disappeared
;
and
,
when
*NL*
Mrs.
March
had
tried
to
thank
her
children
,
and
broken
down
,
while
Teddy
*NL*
wiped
her
eyes
on
his
pinafore
,
the
Professor
suddenly
began
to
sing
.
*NL*
Then
,
from
above
him
,
voice
after
voice
took
up
the
words
,
and
from
tree
*NL*
to
tree
echoed
the
music
of
the
unseen
choir
,
as
the
boys
sung
,
with
all
*NL*
their
hearts
,
the
little
song
Jo
had
written
,
Laurie
set
to
music
,
and
*NL*
the
Professor
trained
his
lads
to
give
with
the
best
effect
.
This
was
*NL*
something
altogether
new
,
and
it
proved
a
grand
success
;
for
Mrs.
March
*NL*
could
n't
get
over
her
surprise
,
and
insisted
on
shaking
hands
with
every
*NL*
one
of
the
featherless
birds
,
from
tall
Franz
and
Emil
to
the
little
*NL*
quadroon
,
who
had
the
sweetest
voice
of
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
the
boys
dispersed
for
a
final
lark
,
leaving
Mrs.
March
and
*NL*
her
daughters
under
the
festival
tree
.

*NL*
taking
Teddy

out
of

milk-pitcher

in

was

rapturously
churning

*NL*
``

asked
Amy
,
smiling
as
she
*NL*
watched
Laurie
and
John
playing
cricket
with
the
boys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
fellows
!
It
does
my
heart
good
to
see
them
forget
business
,
and
*NL*
frolic
for
a
day
,
''
answered
Jo
,
who
now
spoke
in
a
maternal
way
of
all
*NL*
mankind
.
``
Yes
,
I
remember
;
but
the
life
I
wanted
then
seems
selfish
,
*NL*
lonely
,
and
cold
to
me
now
.
I
have
n't
given
up
the
hope
that
I
may
write
*NL*
a
good
book
yet
,
but
I
can
wait
,
and
I
'm
sure
it
will
be
all
the
better
*NL*
for
such
experiences
and
illustrations
as
these
;
''
and
Jo
pointed
from
*NL*
the
lively
lads
in
the
distance
to
her
father
,
leaning
on
the
*NL*
Professor
's
arm
,
as
they
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
sunshine
,
deep
in
one
*NL*
of
the
conversations
which
both
enjoyed
so
much
,
and
then
to
her
mother
,
*NL*
sitting
enthroned
among
her
daughters
,
with
their
children
in
her
lap
*NL*
and
at
her
feet
,
as
if
all
found
help
and
happiness
in
the
face
which
*NL*
never
could
grow
old
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
castle
was
the
most
nearly
realized
of
all
.
I
asked
for
splendid
*NL*
things
,
to
be
sure
,
but
in
my
heart
I
knew
I
should
be
satisfied
,
if
I
*NL*
had
a
little
home
,
and
John
,
and
some
dear
children
like
these
.
I
've
got
*NL*
them
all
,
thank
God
,
and
am
the
happiest
woman
in
the
world
;
''
and
Meg
*NL*
laid
her
hand
on
her
tall
boy
's
head
,
with
a
face
full
of
tender
and
*NL*
devout
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
castle
is
very
different
from
what
I
planned
,
but
I
would
not
alter
*NL*
it
,
though
,
like
Jo
,
I
do
n't
relinquish
all
my
artistic
hopes
,
or
*NL*
confine
myself
to
helping
others
fulfil
their
dreams
of
beauty
.
I
've
*NL*
begun
to
model
a
figure
of
baby
,
and
Laurie
says
it
is
the
best
thing
*NL*
I
've
ever
done
.
I
think
so
myself
,
and
mean
to
do
it
in
marble
,
so
that
,
*NL*
whatever
happens
,
I
may
at
least
keep
the
image
of
my
little
angel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
Amy
spoke
,
a
great
tear
dropped
on
the
golden
hair
of
the
sleeping
*NL*
child
in
her
arms
;
for
her
one
well-beloved
daughter
was
a
frail
little
*NL*
creature
and
the
dread
of
losing
her
was
the
shadow
over
Amy
's
sunshine
.
*NL*
This
cross
was
doing
much
for
both
father
and
mother
,
for
one
love
and
*NL*
sorrow
bound
them
closely
together
.
Amy
's
nature
was
growing
sweeter
,
*NL*
deeper
,
and
more
tender
;
Laurie
was
growing
more
serious
,
strong
,
and
*NL*
firm
;
and
both
were
learning
that
beauty
,
youth
,
good
fortune
,
even
love
*NL*
itself
,
can
not
keep
care
and
pain
,
loss
and
sorrow
,
from
the
most
blest
;
*NL*
for
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Into
each
life
some
rain
must
fall
,
*NL*
Some
days
must
be
dark
and
sad
and
dreary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
growing
better
,
I
am
sure
of
it
,
my
dear
.
Do
n't
despond
,
but
*NL*
hope
and
keep
happy
,
''
said
Mrs.
March
,
as
tender-hearted
Daisy
stooped
*NL*
from
her
knee
,
to
lay
her
rosy
cheek
against
her
little
cousin
's
pale
*NL*
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
ought
to
,
while
I
have
you
to
cheer
me
up
,
Marmee
,
and
Laurie
*NL*
to
take
more
than
half
of
every
burden
,
''
replied
Amy
warmly
.
``
He
never
*NL*
lets
me
see
his
anxiety
,
but
is
so
sweet
and
patient
with
me
,
so
devoted
*NL*
to
Beth
,
and
such
a
stay
and
comfort
to
me
always
,
that
I
ca
n't
love
him
*NL*
enough
.
So
,
in
spite
of
my
one
cross
,
I
can
say
with
Meg
,
`
Thank
God
,
*NL*
I
'm
a
happy
woman
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
need
for
me
to
say
it
,
for
every
one
can
see
that
I
'm
far
*NL*
happier
than
I
deserve
,
''
added
Jo
,
glancing
from
her
good
husband
to
her
*NL*
chubby
children
,
tumbling
on
the
grass
beside
her
.
``
Fritz
is
getting
*NL*
gray
and
stout
;
I
'm
growing
as
thin
as
a
shadow
,
and
am
thirty
;
we
never
*NL*
shall
be
rich
,
and
Plumfield
may
burn
up
any
night
,
for
that
*NL*
incorrigible
Tommy
Bangs
_
will
_
smoke
sweet-fern
cigars
under
the
*NL*
bed-clothes
,
though
he
's
set
himself
afire
three
times
already
.
But
in
*NL*
spite
of
these
unromantic
facts
,
I
have
nothing
to
complain
of
,
and
*NL*
never
was
so
jolly
in
my
life
.
Excuse
the
remark
,
but
living
among
boys
,
*NL*
I
ca
n't
help
using
their
expressions
now
and
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Jo
,
I
think
your
harvest
will
be
a
good
one
,
''
began
Mrs.
March
,
*NL*
frightening
away
a
big
black
cricket
that
was
staring
Teddy
out
of
*NL*
countenance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
half
so
good
as
yours
,
mother
.
Here
it
is
,
and
we
never
can
thank
*NL*
you
enough
for
the
patient
sowing
and
reaping
you
have
done
,
''
cried
Jo
,
*NL*
with
the
loving
impetuosity
which
she
never
could
outgrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
there
will
be
more
wheat
and
fewer
tares
every
year
,
''
said
Amy
*NL*
softly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
large
sheaf
,
but
I
know
there
's
room
in
your
heart

it

Marmee

''
added
Meg
's
tender
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Touched
to
the
heart
,
Mrs.
March
could
only
stretch
out
her
arms
,
as
if
*NL*
to
gather
children
and
grandchildren
to
herself
,
and
say
,
with
face
and
*NL*
voice
full
of
motherly
love
,
gratitude
,
and
humility
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
O

my
girls

however
long
you
may
live

I
never

wish
you
a

happiness
