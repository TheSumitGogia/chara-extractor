A
good
many
of
my
radical
friends
express
a
certain
kindly
*NL*
condescension
when
they
speak
of
Edward
Bellamy
's
``
Looking
Backward
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
you
know
,
''
they
say
,
``
that
it
really
is
n't
first-rate
*NL*
economics
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
in
further
conversation
I
have
known
a
very
large
number
of
*NL*
these
same
somewhat
scornful
Socialists
to
admit
,
``
You
know
,
the
first
*NL*
thing
that
got
me
started
to
thinking
about
Socialism
was
Bellamy
's
*NL*
`
Looking
Backward
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
beginning
it
has
been
a
highly
provocative
book
.
It
is
now
.
*NL*
Many
of
the
questions
both
of
mood
and
technique
are
even
more
*NL*
pertinent
in
the
year
1931
than
they
were
in
1887
.
A
critic
of
the
*NL*
_

Transcript
_
said
,
when
the
novel
first
appeared
,
that
the
new
*NL*
State
imagined
by
Bellamy
was
all
very
well
,
but
that
the
author
lost
*NL*
much
of
his
effectiveness
by
putting
his
Utopia
a
scant
fifty
years
*NL*
ahead
,
and
that
he
might
much
better
have
made
it
seventy-five
*NL*
centuries
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
the
fifty
years
assigned
for
changing
the
world
*NL*
utterly
are
almost
gone
by
now
.
Not
everything
which
was
predicted
in
*NL*
``
Looking
Backward
''
has
come
to
pass
.
But
the
laugh
is
not
against
*NL*
Bellamy
,
but
against
his
critic
.
Some
of
the
things
which
must
have
*NL*
seemed
most
improbable
of
all
to
the
_

_
man
of
1887
are
now
*NL*
actually
in
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
one
respect
Edward
Bellamy
set
down
a
picture
of
modern
American
*NL*
life
which
is
almost
a
hundred
per
cent
realized
.
It
startled
me
to
*NL*
read
the
passage
in
which
Edith
shows
the
musical
schedule
to
Julian
*NL*
West
,
and
tells
him
to
choose
which
selection
he
wishes
to
have
*NL*
brought
through
the
air
into
the
music
room
.
It
is
true
that
Bellamy
*NL*
imagined
this
broadcasting
to
be
done
over
telephone
wires
,
as
is
*NL*
indeed
the
case
to-day
in
some
phases
of
national
hook-ups
.
But
*NL*
consider
this
quotation
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
-LSB-
Dr.
Leete
-RSB-
showed
how
,
by
turning
a
screw
,
the
volume
of
the
*NL*
music
could
be
made
to
fill
the
room
,
or
die
away
to
an
echo
so
faint
*NL*
and
far
that
one
could
scarcely
be
sure
whether
he
heard
or
imagined
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
might
almost
have
been
lifted
bodily
from
an
article
in
some
*NL*
newspaper
radio
column
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Bellamy
did
see
with
clear
vision
things
and
factors
much
more
*NL*
important
than
the
possibility
of
hearing
a
sermon
without
going
to
*NL*
church
.
Much
which
is
now
established
in
Soviet
Russia
bears
at
least
*NL*
a
likeness
to
the
industrial
army
visioned
in
this
prophetic
book
.
*NL*
However
,
Communism
can
scarcely
claim
Bellamy
as
its
own
,
for
he
*NL*
emphasizes
repeatedly
the
non-violent
features
of
the
revolution
which
*NL*
he
imagined
.
Indeed
,
at
one
point
he
argues
that
the
left-wingers
of
*NL*
his
own
day
impeded
change
by
the
very
excesses
of
their
technical
*NL*
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
in
his
book
no
acceptance
of
a
transitional
stage
of
class
*NL*
dictatorship
.
He
sees
the
change
coming
through
a
general
recognition
*NL*
of
the
failings
of
the
capitalist
system
.
Indeed
,
he
sees
a
point
in
*NL*
economic
development
where
capitalism
may
not
even
be
good
enough
for
*NL*
the
capitalist
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
strict
Marxian
Socialist
this
is
profound
and
ridiculous
*NL*
heresy
.
To
me
it
does
not
seem
fantastic
.
And
things
have
happened
in
*NL*
the
world
already
which
were
not
dreamt
of
in
Karl
Marx
's
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
point
I
wish
to
stress
is
the
prevalent
notion
that
all
radical
*NL*
movements
in
America
stem
from
the
writings
of
foreign
authors
.
Now
,
*NL*
Bellamy
,
of
course
,
was
familiar
with
the
pioneer
work
of
Marx
.
And
*NL*
that
part
of
it
which
he
liked
he
took
over
.
Nevertheless
,
he
*NL*
developed
a
contribution
which
was
entirely
his
own
.
It
is
irrelevant
*NL*
to
say
that
,
after
all
,
the
two
men
differed
largely
in
their
view
of
*NL*
the
technique
by
which
the
new
world
was
to
be
accomplished
.
A
*NL*
difference
in
technique
,
as
Trotzky
knows
to
his
sorrow
,
may
be
as
*NL*
profound
as
a
difference
in
principle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bellamy
was
essentially
a
New-Englander
.
His
background
was
that
of
*NL*
Boston
and
its
remote
suburbs
.
And
when
he
preaches
the
necessity
of
*NL*
the
cooperative
commonwealth
,
he
does
it
with
a
Yankee
twang
.
In
fact
,
*NL*
he
is
as
essentially
native
American
as
Norman
Thomas
,
the
present
*NL*
leader
of
the
Socialist
Party
in
this
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
can
not
confess
any
vast
interest
in
the
love
story
which
serves
as
a
*NL*
thread
for
Bellamy
's
vision
of
a
reconstructed
society
.
But
it
can
be
*NL*
said
that
it
is
so
palpably
a
thread
of
sugar
crystal
that
it
need
not
*NL*
get
in
the
way
of
any
reader
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
among
those
who
first
became
interested
in
Socialism
through
*NL*
reading
``
Looking
Backward
''
when
I
was
a
freshman
in
college
.
It
came
*NL*
in
the
first
half-year
of
a
course
which
was
designed
to
prove
that
*NL*
all
radical
panaceas
were
fundamentally
unsound
in
their
conception
.
*NL*
The
professor
played
fair
.
He
gave
us
the
arguments
for
the
radical
*NL*
cause
in
the
fall
and
winter
,
and
proceeded
to
demolish
them
in
spring
*NL*
and
early
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
one
learns
in
the
winter
sticks
more
than
words
uttered
in
*NL*
the
warmth
of
drowsy
May
and
June
.
Possibly
I
took
more
cuts
toward
*NL*
the
end
of
the
lecture
course
.
All
I
can
remember
is
the
arguments
in
*NL*
favor
of
the
radical
plans
.
Their
fallacies
I
have
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
differ
from
Bellamy
's
condescending
converts
because
I
feel
that
he
*NL*
is
close
to
an
entirely
practical
and
possible
scheme
of
life
.
Since
*NL*
much
of
the
fantastic
quality
of
his
vision
has
been
rubbed
down
into
*NL*
reality
within
half
a
century
,
I
think
there
is
at
least
a
fair
chance
*NL*
that
another
fifty
years
will
confirm
Edward
Bellamy
's
position
as
one
*NL*
of
the
most
authentic
prophets
of
our
age
.

*NL*
*NL*
The
great
poet
's
lines
express
Edward
Bellamy
's
aim
in
writing
his
*NL*
famous
book
.
That
aim
would
realize
in
our
country
's
daily
being
the
*NL*
Great
Declaration
that
gave
us
national
existence
;
would
,
in
equality
*NL*
of
opportunity
,
give
man
his
own
earth
to
stand
on
,
and
thereby
--
the
*NL*
race
for
the
first
time
enabled
to
enter
unhampered
upon
the
use
of
*NL*
its
God-given
possibilities
--
achieve
a
progress
unexampled
and
*NL*
marvelous
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
now
twelve
years
since
the
writing
of
`
Looking
Backward
'
changed
*NL*
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
the
younger
American
authors
into
an
*NL*
impassioned
social
reformer
whose
work
was
destined
to
have
momentous
*NL*
effect
upon
the
movement
of
his
age
.
His
quality
had
hitherto
been
*NL*
manifest
in
romances
like
`
Doctor
Heidenhof
's
Process
'
and
`
Miss
*NL*
Ludington
's
Sister
,
'
and
in
many
short
stories
exquisite
in
their
*NL*
imaginative
texture
and
largely
distinguished
by
a
strikingly
original
*NL*
development
of
psychical
themes
.
Tales
like
`
The
Blindman
's
World
'
and
*NL*
`
To
Whom
This
May
Come
'
will
long
linger
in
the
memory
of
magazine
*NL*
readers
of
the
past
twenty
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Doctor
Heidenhof
'
was
at
once
recognized
as
a
psychological
study
of
*NL*
uncommon
power
.
``
Its
writer
,
''
said
an
English
review
,
``
is
the
lineal
*NL*
intellectual
descendant
of
Hawthorne
.
''
Nor
was
there
in
America
any
*NL*
lack
of
appreciation
of
that
originality
and
that
distinction
of
style
*NL*
which
mark
Edward
Bellamy
's
early
work
.
In
all
this
there
was
a
strong
*NL*
dominant
note
prophetic
of
the
author
's
future
activity
.
That
note
was
*NL*
a
steadfast
faith
in
the
intrinsic
goodness
of
human
nature
,
a
sense
*NL*
of
the
meaning
of
love
in
its
true
and
universal
sense
.
`
Looking
*NL*
Backward
,
'
though
ostensibly
a
romance
,
is
universally
recognized
as
a
*NL*
great
economic
treatise
in
a
framework
of
fiction
.
Without
this
guise
*NL*
it
could
not
have
obtained
the
foothold
that
it
did
;
there
is
just
*NL*
enough
of
the
skillful
novelist
's
touch
in
its
composition
to
give
*NL*
plausibility
to
the
book
and
exert
a
powerful
influence
upon
the
*NL*
popular
imagination
.
The
ingenious
device
by
which
a
man
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
is
transferred
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
,
and
the
*NL*
vivid
dramatic
quality
of
the
dream
at
the
end
of
the
book
,
are
*NL*
instances
of
the
art
of
the
trained
novelist
which
make
the
work
*NL*
unique
of
its
kind
.
Neither
could
the
book
have
been
a
success
had
not
*NL*
the
world
been
ripe
for
its
reception
.
The
materials
were
ready
and
*NL*
waiting
;
the
spark
struck
fire
in
the
midst
of
them
.
Little
more
than
*NL*
a
decade
has
followed
its
publication
,
and
the
world
is
filled
with
*NL*
the
agitation
that
it
helped
kindle
.
It
has
given
direction
to
*NL*
economic
thought
and
shape
to
political
action
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edward
Bellamy
was
born
in
1850
,
--
almost
exactly
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
century
whose
closing
years
he
was
destined
so
notably
to
affect
.
His
*NL*
home
has
always
been
in
his
native
village
of
Chicopee
Falls
,
*NL*
Massachusetts
,
now
a
portion
of
the
city
of
Chicopee
,
one
of
the
group
*NL*
of
municipalities
of
which
Springfield
is
the
nucleus
.
He
lived
on
*NL*
Church
Street
in
a
house
long
the
home
of
his
father
,
a
beloved
*NL*
Baptist
clergyman
of
the
town
.
His
clerical
ancestry
is
perhaps
*NL*
responsible
for
his
essentially
religious
nature
.
His
maternal
*NL*
grandfather
was
the
Rev.
Benjamin
Putnam
,
one
of
the
early
pastors
of
*NL*
Springfield
,
and
among
his
paternal
ancestors
was
Dr.
Joseph
Bellamy
*NL*
of
Bethlehem
,
Connecticut
,
a
distinguished
theologian
of
revolutionary
*NL*
days
,
a
friend
of
Jonathan
Edwards
,
and
the
preceptor
of
Aaron
Burr
.
*NL*
He
,
however
,
outgrew
with
his
boyhood
all
trammels
of
sect
.
But
this
*NL*
inherited
trait
marked
his
social
views
with
a
strongly
*NL*
anti-materialistic
and
spiritual
cast
;
an
ethical
purpose
dominated
*NL*
his
ideas
,
and
he
held
that
a
merely
material
prosperity
would
not
be
*NL*
worth
the
working
for
as
a
social
ideal
.
An
equality
in
material
*NL*
well-being
,
however
,
he
regarded
as
the
soil
essential
for
the
true
*NL*
spiritual
development
of
the
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Bellamy
entered
Union
College
at
Schenectady
,
but
was
not
*NL*
graduated
.
After
a
year
in
Germany
he
studied
law
and
entered
the
bar
,
*NL*
but
never
practiced
.
A
literary
career
appealed
to
him
more
strongly
,
*NL*
and
journalism
seemed
the
more
available
gateway
thereto
.
His
first
*NL*
newspaper
experience
was
on
the
staff
of
the
New
York
`
Evening
Post
,
'
*NL*
and
from
that
journal
he
went
to
the
Springfield
`
Union
.
'
Besides
his
*NL*
European
trip
,
a
journey
to
Hawaii
by
way
of
Panama
and
a
return
*NL*
across
the
continent
gave
a
considerable
geographical
range
to
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
world
at
large
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
notable
that
his
first
public
utterance
,
made
before
a
local
*NL*
lyceum
when
a
youth
in
his
teens
,
was
devoted
to
sentiments
of
social
*NL*
reform
that
foreshadowed
his
future
work
.
When
`
Looking
Backward
'
was
*NL*
the
sensation
of
the
year
,
a
newspaper
charge
brought
against
Mr.
*NL*
Bellamy
was
that
he
was
``
posing
for
notoriety
.
''
To
those
who
know
the
*NL*
retiring
,
modest
,
and
almost
diffident
personality
of
the
author
,
*NL*
nothing
could
have
been
more
absurd
.
All
opportunities
to
make
money
*NL*
upon
the
magnificent
advertising
given
by
a
phenomenal
literary
*NL*
success
were
disregarded
.
There
were
offers
of
lecture
engagements
*NL*
that
would
have
brought
quick
fortune
,
requests
from
magazine
editors
*NL*
for
articles
and
stories
on
any
terms
that
he
might
name
,
proffered
*NL*
inducements
from
publishers
to
write
a
new
book
and
to
take
advantage
*NL*
of
the
occasion
to
make
a
volume
of
his
short
stories
with
the
*NL*
assurance
of
a
magnificent
sale
,
--
to
all
this
he
was
strikingly
*NL*
indifferent
.
Two
or
three
public
addresses
,
a
few
articles
in
the
*NL*
reviews
,
and
for
a
while
the
editorship
of
`
The
New
Nation
,
'
a
weekly
*NL*
periodical
which
he
established
in
Boston
,
--
this
was
the
sum
of
his
*NL*
public
activity
until
he
should
have
made
himself
ready
for
a
second
*NL*
sustained
effort
.
To
all
sordid
incentives
he
was
as
indifferent
as
if
*NL*
he
had
been
a
child
of
his
new
order
,
a
century
later
.
The
hosts
of
*NL*
personal
friends
whom
his
work
made
for
him
knew
him
as
a
winsome
*NL*
personality
;
and
really
to
know
him
was
to
love
him
.
His
nature
was
*NL*
keenly
sympathetic
;
his
conversation
ready
and
charming
,
quickly
*NL*
responsive
to
suggestion
,
illuminated
by
gentle
humor
and
occasionally
*NL*
a
flash
of
playful
satire
.
He
disliked
controversy
,
with
its
waste
of
*NL*
energy
in
profitless
discussion
,
and
jestingly
averred
that
if
there
*NL*
were
any
reformers
living
in
his
neighborhood
he
should
move
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cardinal
features
of
`
Looking
Backward
,
'
that
distinguish
it
from
*NL*
the
generality
of
Utopian
literature
,
lie
in
its
definite
scheme
of
*NL*
industrial
organization
on
a
national
basis
,
and
the
equal
share
*NL*
allotted
to
all
persons
in
the
products
of
industry
,
or
the
public
*NL*
income
,
on
the
same
ground
that
men
share
equally
in
the
free
gifts
of
*NL*
nature
,
like
air
to
breathe
and
water
to
drink
;
it
being
absolutely
*NL*
impossible
to
determine
any
equitable
ratio
between
individual
*NL*
industrial
effort
and
individual
share
in
industrial
product
on
a
*NL*
graded
basis
.
The
book
,
however
,
was
little
more
than
an
outline
of
*NL*
the
system
,
and
,
after
an
interval
devoted
to
continuous
thought
and
*NL*
study
,
many
points
called
for
elaboration
.
Mr.
Bellamy
gave
his
last
*NL*
years
and
his
ripest
efforts
to
an
exposition
of
the
economical
and
*NL*
ethical
basis
of
the
new
order
which
he
held
that
the
natural
course
*NL*
of
social
evolution
would
establish
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Equality
'
is
the
title
of
his
last
book
.
It
is
a
more
elaborate
work
*NL*
than
`
Looking
Backward
,
'
and
in
fact
is
a
comprehensive
economic
*NL*
treatise
upon
the
subject
that
gives
it
its
name
.
It
is
a
sequel
to
*NL*
its
famous
predecessor
,
and
its
keynote
is
given
in
the
remark
that
*NL*
the
immortal
preamble
of
the
American
Declaration
of
Independence
*NL*
-LRB-
characterized
as
the
true
constitution
of
the
United
States
-RRB-
,
*NL*
logically
contained
the
entire
statement
of
universal
economic
*NL*
equality
guaranteed
by
the
nation
collectively
to
its
members
*NL*
individually
.
``
The
corner-stone
of
our
state
is
economic
equality
,
and
*NL*
is
not
that
the
obvious
,
necessary
,
and
only
adequate
pledge
of
these
*NL*
three
rights
,
--
life
,
liberty
,
and
happiness
?
What
is
life
without
its
*NL*
material
basis
,
and
what
is
an
equal
right
to
life
but
a
right
to
an
*NL*
equal
material
basis
for
it
?
What
is
liberty
?
How
can
men
be
free
who
*NL*
must
ask
the
right
to
labor
and
to
live
from
their
fellow-men
and
seek
*NL*
their
bread
from
the
hands
of
others
?
How
else
can
any
government
*NL*
guarantee
liberty
to
men
save
by
providing
them
a
means
of
labor
and
*NL*
of
life
coupled
with
independence
;
and
how
could
that
be
done
unless
*NL*
the
government
conducted
the
economic
system
upon
which
employment
and
*NL*
maintenance
depend
?
Finally
,
what
is
implied
in
the
equal
right
of
all
*NL*
to
the
pursuit
of
happiness
?
What
form
of
happiness
,
so
far
as
it
*NL*
depends
at
all
upon
material
facts
,
is
not
bound
up
with
economic
*NL*
conditions
;
and
how
shall
an
equal
opportunity
for
the
pursuit
of
*NL*
happiness
be
guaranteed
to
all
save
by
a
guarantee
of
economic
*NL*
equality
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
is
so
full
of
ideas
,
so
replete
with
suggestive
aspects
,
so
*NL*
rich
in
quotable
parts
,
as
to
form
an
arsenal
of
argument
for
apostles
*NL*
of
the
new
democracy
.
As
with
`
Looking
Backward
,
'
the
humane
and
*NL*
thoughtful
reader
will
lay
down
`
Equality
'
and
regard
the
world
about
*NL*
him
with
a
feeling
akin
to
that
with
which
the
child
of
the
tenement
*NL*
returns
from
his
``
country
week
''
to
the
foul
smells
,
the
discordant
*NL*
noises
,
the
incessant
strife
of
the
wonted
environment
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
writing
of
`
Equality
'
was
a
task
too
great
for
the
physical
*NL*
strength
and
vitality
of
its
author
.
His
health
,
never
robust
,
gave
*NL*
way
completely
,
and
the
book
was
finished
by
an
indomitable
and
*NL*
inflexible
dominion
of
the
powerful
mind
over
the
failing
body
which
*NL*
was
nothing
short
of
heroic
.
Consumption
,
that
common
New
England
*NL*
inheritance
,
developed
suddenly
,
and
in
September
of
1897
Mr.
Bellamy
*NL*
went
with
his
family
to
Denver
,
willing
to
seek
the
cure
which
he
*NL*
scarcely
hoped
to
find
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
welcome
accorded
to
him
in
the
West
,
where
his
work
had
met
with
*NL*
widespread
and
profound
attention
,
was
one
of
his
latest
and
greatest
*NL*
pleasures
.
Letters
came
from
mining
camps
,
from
farms
and
villages
,
*NL*
the
writers
all
longing
to
do
something
for
him
to
show
their
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
singular
modesty
already
spoken
of
as
characterizing
Mr.
Bellamy
,
*NL*
and
an
entire
unwillingness
to
accept
any
personal
and
public
*NL*
recognition
,
had
perhaps
kept
him
from
a
realization
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
his
fame
was
international
.
But
the
author
of
a
book
which
in
ten
*NL*
years
had
sold
nearly
a
million
of
copies
in
England
and
America
,
and
*NL*
which
had
been
translated
into
German
,
French
,
Russian
,
Italian
,
*NL*
Arabic
,
Bulgarian
,
and
several
other
languages
and
dialects
,
found
*NL*
himself
not
among
strangers
,
although
two
thousand
miles
from
the
home
*NL*
of
his
lifetime
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
greatly
appreciated
and
gratefully
acknowledged
his
welcome
to
*NL*
Colorado
,
which
he
left
in
April
,
1898
,
when
he
realized
that
his
life
*NL*
was
rapidly
drawing
to
a
close
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
died
on
Sunday
morning
,
May
22
,
after
a
month
in
the
old
home
which
*NL*
he
had
eagerly
desired
to
see
again
,
leaving
a
widow
and
two
young
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
simple
service
held
there
,
with
his
kindred
and
the
friends
of
*NL*
a
lifetime
about
him
,
the
following
passages
from
`
Looking
Backward
'
*NL*
and
`
Equality
'
were
read
as
a
fitting
expression
,
in
his
own
words
,
of
*NL*
that
hope
for
the
bettering
and
uplifting
of
Humanity
,
which
was
the
*NL*
real
passion
of
his
noble
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Said
not
the
serpent
in
the
old
story
,
`
If
you
eat
of
the
fruit
of
*NL*
the
tree
of
knowledge
you
shall
be
as
gods
?
'
The
promise
was
true
in
*NL*
words
,
but
apparently
there
was
some
mistake
about
the
tree
.
Perhaps
*NL*
it
was
the
tree
of
selfish
knowledge
,
or
else
the
fruit
was
not
ripe
.
*NL*
The
story
is
obscure
.
Christ
later
said
the
same
thing
when
he
told
*NL*
men
that
they
might
be
the
sons
of
God
.
But
he
made
no
mistake
as
to
*NL*
the
tree
he
showed
them
,
and
the
fruit
was
ripe
.
It
was
the
fruit
of
*NL*
love
,
for
universal
love
is
at
once
the
seed
and
fruit
,
cause
and
*NL*
effect
,
of
the
highest
and
completest
knowledge
.
Through
boundless
*NL*
love
man
becomes
a
god
,
for
thereby
is
he
made
conscious
of
his
*NL*
oneness
with
God
,
and
all
things
are
put
under
his
feet
.
`
If
we
love
*NL*
one
another
,
God
dwelleth
in
us
and
his
love
is
perfected
in
us
.
'
`
He
*NL*
that
loveth
his
brother
dwelleth
in
the
light
.
'
`
If
any
man
say
,
I
*NL*
love
God
,
and
hateth
his
brother
,
he
is
a
liar
.
'
`
He
that
loveth
not
*NL*
his
brother
abideth
in
death
.
'
`
God
is
love
,
and
he
that
dwelleth
in
*NL*
love
dwelleth
in
God
.
'
`
Every
one
that
loveth
knoweth
God

He
that
*NL*
loveth
not
knoweth
not

*NL*
``
Here
is
the
very
distillation
of
Christ
's
teaching
as
to
the
*NL*
conditions
of
entering
on
the
divine
life
.
In
this
we
find
the
*NL*
sufficient
explanation
why
the
revelation
which
came
to
Christ
so
long
*NL*
ago
and
to
other
illumined
souls
could
not
possibly
be
received
by
*NL*
mankind
in
general
so
long
as
an
inhuman
social
order
made
a
wall
*NL*
between
man
and
God
,
and
why
,
the
moment
that
wall
was
cast
down
,
the
*NL*
revelation
flooded
the
earth
like
a
sunburst
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
If
we
love
one
another
,
God
dwelleth
in
us
,
'
and
mark
how
the
words
*NL*
were
made
good
in
the
way
by
which
at
last
the
race
found
God
!
It
was
*NL*
not
,
remember
,
by
directly
,
purposely
,
or
consciously
seeking
God
.
The
*NL*
great
enthusiasm
of
humanity
which
overthrew
the
older
and
brought
in
*NL*
the
fraternal
society
was
not
primarily
or
consciously
a
Godward
*NL*
aspiration
at
all
.
It
was
essentially
a
humane
movement
.
It
was
a
*NL*
melting
and
flowing
forth
of
men
's
hearts
toward
one
another
;
a
rush
*NL*
of
contrite
,
repentant
tenderness
;
an
impassioned
impulse
of
mutual
*NL*
love
and
self-devotion
to
the
common
weal
.
But
`
if
we
love
one
*NL*
another
,
God
dwelleth
in
us
,
'
and
so
man
found
it
.
It
appears
that
*NL*
there
came
a
moment
,
the
most
transcendent
moment
in
the
history
of
*NL*
the
race
of
man
,
when
with
the
fraternal
glow
of
this
world
of
*NL*
new-found
embracing
brothers
there
seems
to
have
mingled
the
ineffable
*NL*
thrill
of
a
divine
participation
,
as
if
the
hand
of
God
were
clasped
*NL*
over
the
joined
hands
of
men
.
And
so
it
has
continued
to
this
day
and
*NL*
shall
for
evermore
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
seers
and
poets
in
exalted
moments
had
seen
that
death
was
but
a
*NL*
step
in
life
,
but
this
seemed
to
most
of
you
to
have
been
a
hard
*NL*
saying
.
Nowadays
,
as
life
advances
toward
its
close
,
instead
of
being
*NL*
shadowed
by
gloom
,
it
is
marked
by
an
access
of
impassioned
expectancy
*NL*
which
would
cause
the
young
to
envy
the
old
,
but
for
the
knowledge
*NL*
that
in
a
little
while
the
same
door
will
be
opened
to
them
.
In
your
*NL*
day
the
undertone
of
life
seems
to
have
been
one
of
unutterable
*NL*
sadness
,
which
,
like
the
moaning
of
the
sea
to
those
who
live
near
the
*NL*
ocean
,
made
itself
audible
whenever
for
a
moment
the
noise
and
bustle
*NL*
of
petty
engrossments
ceased
.
Now
this
undertone
is
so
exultant
that
*NL*
we
are
still
to
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ask
what
we
look
for
when
unnumbered
generations
shall
have
*NL*
passed
away
?
I
answer
,
the
way
stretches
far
before
us
,
but
the
end
is
*NL*
lost
in
light
.
For
twofold
is
the
return
of
man
to
God
,
`
who
is
our
*NL*
home
,
'
the
return
of
the
individual
by
the
way
of
death
,
and
the
*NL*
return
of
the
race
by
the
fulfillment
of
its
evolution
,
when
the
*NL*
divine
secret
hidden
in
the
germ
shall
be
perfectly
unfolded
.
With
a
*NL*
tear
for
the
dark
past
,
turn
we
then
to
the
dazzling
future
,
and
,
*NL*
veiling
our
eyes
,
press
forward
.
The
long
and
weary
winter
of
the
race
*NL*
is
ended
.
Its
summer
has
begun

Humanity
has
burst
the
chrysalis
.
The
*NL*
heavens
are
before
it

There
are
those
who
have
made
strenuous
objections
to
the
ideals
of

Edward
Bellamy
on
the
ground

they
are
based
on
nothing
better
*NL*
than
purely
material
well-being

.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Living
as
we
do
in
the
closing
year
of
the
twentieth
century
,
enjoying
*NL*
the
blessings
of
a
social
order
at
once
so
simple
and
logical
that
it
*NL*
seems
but
the
triumph
of
common
sense
,
it
is
no
doubt
difficult
for
*NL*
those
whose
studies
have
not
been
largely
historical
to
realize
that
*NL*
the
present
organization
of
society
is
,
in
its
completeness
,
less
than
*NL*
a
century
old
.
No
historical
fact
is
,
however
,
better
established
than
*NL*
that
till
nearly
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
was
the
general
*NL*
belief
that
the
ancient
industrial
system
,
with
all
its
shocking
*NL*
social
consequences
,
was
destined
to
last
,
with
possibly
a
little
*NL*
patching
,
to
the
end
of
time
.
How
strange
and
wellnigh
incredible
does
*NL*
it
seem
that
so
prodigious
a
moral
and
material
transformation
as
has
*NL*
taken
place
since
then
could
have
been
accomplished
in
so
brief
an
*NL*
interval
?
The
readiness
with
which
men
accustom
themselves
,
as
*NL*
matters
of
course
,
to
improvements
in
their
condition
,
which
,
when
*NL*
anticipated
,
seemed
to
leave
nothing
more
to
be
desired
,
could
not
be
*NL*
more
strikingly
illustrated
.
What
reflection
could
be
better
*NL*
calculated
to
moderate
the
enthusiasm
of
reformers
who
count
for
their
*NL*
reward
on
the
lively
gratitude
of
future
ages
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
object
of
this
volume
is
to
assist
persons
who
,
while
desiring
to
*NL*
gain
a
more
definite
idea
of
the
social
contrasts
between
the
*NL*
nineteenth
and
twentieth
centuries
,
are
daunted
by
the
formal
aspect
*NL*
of
the
histories
which
treat
the
subject
.
Warned
by
a
teacher
's
*NL*
experience
that
learning
is
accounted
a
weariness
to
the
flesh
,
the
*NL*
author
has
sought
to
alleviate
the
instructive
quality
of
the
book
by
*NL*
casting
it
in
the
form
of
a
romantic
narrative
,
which
he
would
be
glad
*NL*
to
fancy
not
wholly
devoid
of
interest
on
its
own
account
.

The
reader
,
to
whom
modern
social
institutions
and
their
underlying
*NL*
principles
are
matters
of
course
,
may
at
times
find
Dr.
Leete
's
*NL*
explanations
of
them
rather
trite
,
--
but
it
must
be
remembered
that
to
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
's
guest
they
were
not
matters
of
course
,
and
that
this
book
*NL*
is
written
for
the
express
purpose
of
inducing
the
reader
to
forget
*NL*
for
the
nonce
that
they
are
so
to
him
.
One
word
more
.
The
almost
*NL*
universal
theme
of
the
writers
and
orators
who
have
celebrated
this
*NL*
bi-millennial
epoch
has
been
the
future
rather
than
the
past
,
not
the
*NL*
advance
that
has
been
made
,
but
the
progress
that
shall
be
made
,
ever
*NL*
onward
and
upward
,
till
the
race
shall
achieve
its
ineffable
destiny
.
*NL*
This
is
well
,
wholly
well
,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
nowhere
can
we
find
*NL*
more
solid
ground
for
daring
anticipations
of
human
development
during
*NL*
the
next
one
thousand
years
,
than
by
``
Looking
Backward
''
upon
the
*NL*
progress
of
the
last
one
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
this
volume
may
be
so
fortunate
as
to
find
readers
whose
interest
*NL*
in
the
subject
shall
incline
them
to
overlook
the
deficiencies
of
the
*NL*
treatment
is
the
hope
in
which
the
author
steps
aside
and
leaves
Mr.
*NL*
Julian
West
to
speak
for
himself
.

CHAPTER
I.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
first
saw
the
light
in
the
city
of
Boston
in
the
year
1857
.
``
What
!
''
*NL*
you
say
,
``
eighteen
fifty-seven
?
That
is
an
odd
slip
.
He
means
nineteen
*NL*
fifty-seven
,
of
course
.
''
I
beg
pardon
,
but
there
is
no
mistake
.
It
was
*NL*
about
four
in
the
afternoon
of
December
the
26th
,
one
day
after
*NL*
Christmas
,
in
the
year
1857
,
not
1957
,
that
I
first
breathed
the
east
*NL*
wind
of
Boston
,
which
,
I
assure
the
reader
,
was
at
that
remote
period
*NL*
marked
by
the
same
penetrating
quality
characterizing
it
in
the
*NL*
present
year
of
grace
,
2000
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
statements
seem
so
absurd
on
their
face
,
especially
when
I
add
*NL*
that
I
am
a
young
man
apparently
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
,
that
no
*NL*
person
can
be
blamed
for
refusing
to
read
another
word
of
what
*NL*
promises
to
be
a
mere
imposition
upon
his
credulity
.
Nevertheless
I
*NL*
earnestly
assure
the
reader
that
no
imposition
is
intended
,
and
will
*NL*
undertake
,
if
he
shall
follow
me
a
few
pages
,
to
entirely
convince
him
*NL*
of
this
.
If
I
may
,
then
,
provisionally
assume
,
with
the
pledge
of
*NL*
justifying
the
assumption
,
that
I
know
better
than
the
reader
when
I
*NL*
was
born
,
I
will
go
on
with
my
narrative
.
As
every
schoolboy
knows
,
in
*NL*
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
civilization
of
to-day
,
*NL*
or
anything
like
it
,
did
not
exist
,
although
the
elements
which
were
*NL*
to
develop
it
were
already
in
ferment
.
Nothing
had
,
however
,
occurred
*NL*
to
modify
the
immemorial
division
of
society
into
the
four
classes
,
or
*NL*
nations
,
as
they
may
be
more
fitly
called
,
since
the
differences
*NL*
between
them
were
far
greater
than
those
between
any
nations
nowadays
,
*NL*
of
the
rich
and
the
poor
,
the
educated
and
the
ignorant
.
I
myself
was
*NL*
rich
and
also
educated
,
and
possessed
,
therefore
,
all
the
elements
of
*NL*
happiness
enjoyed
by
the
most
fortunate
in
that
age
.
Living
in
luxury
,
*NL*
and
occupied
only
with
the
pursuit
of
the
pleasures
and
refinements
of
*NL*
life
,
I
derived
the
means
of
my
support
from
the
labor
of
others
,
*NL*
rendering
no
sort
of
service
in
return
.
My
parents
and
grandparents
*NL*
had
lived
in
the
same
way
,
and
I
expected
that
my
descendants
,
if
I
*NL*
had
any
,
would
enjoy
a
like
easy
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
could
I
live
without
service
to
the
world
?
you
ask
.
Why
should
*NL*
the
world
have
supported
in
utter
idleness
one
who
was
able
to
render
*NL*
service
?
The
answer
is
that
my
great-grandfather
had
accumulated
a
sum
*NL*
of
money
on
which
his
descendants
had
ever
since
lived
.
The
sum
,
you
*NL*
will
naturally
infer
,
must
have
been
very
large
not
to
have
been
*NL*
exhausted
in
supporting
three
generations
in
idleness
.
This
,
however
,
*NL*
was
not
the
fact
.
The
sum
had
been
originally
by
no
means
large
.
It
*NL*
was
,
in
fact
,
much
larger
now
that
three
generations
had
been
*NL*
supported
upon
it
in
idleness
,
than
it
was
at
first
.
This
mystery
of
*NL*
use
without
consumption
,
of
warmth
without
combustion
,
seems
like
*NL*
magic
,
but
was
merely
an
ingenious
application
of
the
art
now
happily
*NL*
lost
but
carried
to
great
perfection
by
your
ancestors
,
of
shifting
*NL*
the
burden
of
one
's
support
on
the
shoulders
of
others
.
The
man
who
*NL*
had
accomplished
this
,
and
it
was
the
end
all
sought
,
was
said
to
live
*NL*
on
the
income
of
his
investments
.
To
explain
at
this
point
how
the
*NL*
ancient
methods
of
industry
made
this
possible
would
delay
us
too
*NL*
much
.
I
shall
only
stop
now
to
say
that
interest
on
investments
was
a
*NL*
species
of
tax
in
perpetuity
upon
the
product
of
those
engaged
in
*NL*
industry
which
a
person
possessing
or
inheriting
money
was
able
to
*NL*
levy
.
It
must
not
be
supposed
that
an
arrangement
which
seems
so
*NL*
unnatural
and
preposterous
according
to
modern
notions
was
never
*NL*
criticised
by
your
ancestors
.
It
had
been
the
effort
of
law-givers
and
*NL*
prophets
from
the
earliest
ages
to
abolish
interest
,
or
at
least
to
*NL*
limit
it
to
the
smallest
possible
rate
.
All
these
efforts
had
,
*NL*
however
,
failed
,
as
they
necessarily
must
so
long
as
the
ancient
*NL*
social
organizations
prevailed
.
At
the
time
of
which
I
write
,
the
*NL*
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
governments
had
generally
given
*NL*
up
trying
to
regulate
the
subject
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
way
of
attempting
to
give
the
reader
some
general
impression
of
the
*NL*
way
people
lived
together
in
those
days
,
and
especially
of
the
*NL*
relations
of
the
rich
and
poor
to
one
another
,
perhaps
I
can
not
do
*NL*
better
than
to
compare
society
as
it
then
was
to
a
prodigious
coach
*NL*
which
the
masses
of
humanity
were
harnessed
to
and
dragged
toilsomely
*NL*
along
a
very
hilly
and
sandy
road
.
The
driver
was
hunger
,
and
*NL*
permitted
no
lagging
,
though
the
pace
was
necessarily
very
slow
.
*NL*
Despite
the
difficulty
of
drawing
the
coach
at
all
along
so
hard
a
*NL*
road
,
the
top
was
covered
with
passengers
who
never
got
down
,
even
at
*NL*
the
steepest
ascents
.
These
seats
on
top
were
very
breezy
and
*NL*
comfortable
.
Well
up
out
of
the
dust
,
their
occupants
could
enjoy
the
*NL*
scenery
at
their
leisure
,
or
critically
discuss
the
merits
of
the
*NL*
straining
team
.
Naturally
such
places
were
in
great
demand
and
the
*NL*
competition
for
them
was
keen
,
every
one
seeking
as
the
first
end
in
*NL*
life
to
secure
a
seat
on
the
coach
for
himself
and
to
leave
it
to
his
*NL*
child
after
him
.
By
the
rule
of
the
coach
a
man
could
leave
his
seat
*NL*
to
whom
he
wished
,
but
on
the
other
hand
there
were
many
accidents
by
*NL*
which
it
might
at
any
time
be
wholly
lost
.
For
all
that
they
were
so
*NL*
easy
,
the
seats
were
very
insecure
,
and
at
every
sudden
jolt
of
the
*NL*
coach
persons
were
slipping
out
of
them
and
falling
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
where
they
were
instantly
compelled
to
take
hold
of
the
rope
and
help
*NL*
to
drag
the
coach
on
which
they
had
before
ridden
so
pleasantly
.
It
*NL*
was
naturally
regarded
as
a
terrible
misfortune
to
lose
one
's
seat
,
*NL*
and
the
apprehension
that
this
might
happen
to
them
or
their
friends
*NL*
was
a
constant
cloud
upon
the
happiness
of
those
who
rode
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
did
they
think
only
of
themselves
?
you
ask
.
Was
not
their
very
*NL*
luxury
rendered
intolerable
to
them
by
comparison
with
the
lot
of
*NL*
their
brothers
and
sisters
in
the
harness
,
and
the
knowledge
that
*NL*
their
own
weight
added
to
their
toil
?
Had
they
no
compassion
for
*NL*
fellow
beings
from
whom
fortune
only
distinguished
them
?
Oh
,
yes
;
*NL*
commiseration
was
frequently
expressed
by
those
who
rode
for
those
who
*NL*
had
to
pull
the
coach
,
especially
when
the
vehicle
came
to
a
bad
place
*NL*
in
the
road
,
as
it
was
constantly
doing
,
or
to
a
particularly
steep
*NL*
hill
.
At
such
times
,
the
desperate
straining
of
the
team
,
their
*NL*
agonized
leaping
and
plunging
under
the
pitiless
lashing
of
hunger
,
*NL*
the
many
who
fainted
at
the
rope
and
were
trampled
in
the
mire
,
made
a
*NL*
very
distressing
spectacle
,
which
often
called
forth
highly
creditable
*NL*
displays
of
feeling
on
the
top
of
the
coach
.
At
such
times
the
*NL*
passengers
would
call
down
encouragingly
to
the
toilers
of
the
rope
,
*NL*
exhorting
them
to
patience
,
and
holding
out
hopes
of
possible
*NL*
compensation
in
another
world
for
the
hardness
of
their
lot
,
while
*NL*
others
contributed
to
buy
salves
and
liniments
for
the
crippled
and
*NL*
injured
.
It
was
agreed
that
it
was
a
great
pity
that
the
coach
should
*NL*
be
so
hard
to
pull
,
and
there
was
a
sense
of
general
relief
when
the
*NL*
specially
bad
piece
of
road
was
gotten
over
.
This
relief
was
not
,
*NL*
indeed
,
wholly
on
account
of
the
team
,
for
there
was
always
some
*NL*
danger
at
these
bad
places
of
a
general
overturn
in
which
all
would
*NL*
lose
their
seats
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
must
in
truth
be
admitted
that
the
main
effect
of
the
spectacle
of
*NL*
the
misery
of
the
toilers
at
the
rope
was
to
enhance
the
passengers
'
*NL*
sense
of
the
value
of
their
seats
upon
the
coach
,
and
to
cause
them
to
*NL*
hold
on
to
them
more
desperately
than
before
.
If
the
passengers
could
*NL*
only
have
felt
assured
that
neither
they
nor
their
friends
would
ever
*NL*
fall
from
the
top
,
it
is
probable
that
,
beyond
contributing
to
the
*NL*
funds
for
liniments
and
bandages
,
they
would
have
troubled
themselves
*NL*
extremely
little
about
those
who
dragged
the
coach
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
well
aware
that
this
will
appear
to
the
men
and
women
of
the
*NL*
twentieth
century
an
incredible
inhumanity
,
but
there
are
two
facts
,
*NL*
both
very
curious
,
which
partly
explain
it
.
In
the
first
place
,
it
was
*NL*
firmly
and
sincerely
believed
that
there
was
no
other
way
in
which
*NL*
Society
could
get
along
,
except
the
many
pulled
at
the
rope
and
the
*NL*
few
rode
,
and
not
only
this
,
but
that
no
very
radical
improvement
even
*NL*
was
possible
,
either
in
the
harness
,
the
coach
,
the
roadway
,
or
the
*NL*
distribution
of
the
toil
.
It
had
always
been
as
it
was
,
and
it
always
*NL*
would
be
so
.
It
was
a
pity
,
but
it
could
not
be
helped
,
and
philosophy
*NL*
forbade
wasting
compassion
on
what
was
beyond
remedy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
fact
is
yet
more
curious
,
consisting
in
a
singular
*NL*
hallucination
which
those
on
the
top
of
the
coach
generally
shared
,
*NL*
that
they
were
not
exactly
like
their
brothers
and
sisters
who
pulled
*NL*
at
the
rope
,
but
of
finer
clay
,
in
some
way
belonging
to
a
higher
*NL*
order
of
beings
who
might
justly
expect
to
be
drawn
.
This
seems
*NL*
unaccountable
,
but
,
as
I
once
rode
on
this
very
coach
and
shared
that
*NL*
very
hallucination
,
I
ought
to
be
believed
.
The
strangest
thing
about
*NL*
the
hallucination
was
that
those
who
had
but
just
climbed
up
from
the
*NL*
ground
,
before
they
had
outgrown
the
marks
of
the
rope
upon
their
*NL*
hands
,
began
to
fall
under
its
influence
.
As
for
those
whose
parents
*NL*
and
grandparents
before
them
had
been
so
fortunate
as
to
keep
their
*NL*
seats
on
the
top
,
the
conviction
they
cherished
of
the
essential
*NL*
difference
between
their
sort
of
humanity
and
the
common
article
was
*NL*
absolute
.
The
effect
of
such
a
delusion
in
moderating
fellow
feeling
*NL*
for
the
sufferings
of
the
mass
of
men
into
a
distant
and
philosophical
*NL*
compassion
is
obvious
.
To
it
I
refer
as
the
only
extenuation
I
can
*NL*
offer
for
the
indifference
which
,
at
the
period
I
write
of
,
marked
my
*NL*
own
attitude
toward
the
misery
of
my
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
1887
I
came
to
my
thirtieth
year
.
Although
still
unmarried
,
I
was
*NL*
engaged
to
wed
Edith
Bartlett
.
She
,
like
myself
,
rode
on
the
top
of
*NL*
the
coach
.
That
is
to
say
,
not
to
encumber
ourselves
further
with
an
*NL*
illustration
which
has
,
I
hope
,
served
its
purpose
of
giving
the
*NL*
reader
some
general
impression
of
how
we
lived
then
,
her
family
was
*NL*
wealthy
.
In
that
age
,
when
money
alone
commanded
all
that
was
*NL*
agreeable
and
refined
in
life
,
it
was
enough
for
a
woman
to
be
rich
to
*NL*
have
suitors
;
but
Edith
Bartlett
was
beautiful
and
graceful
also
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
lady
readers
,
I
am
aware
,
will
protest
at
this
.
``
Handsome
she
might
*NL*
have
been
,
''
I
hear
them
saying
,
``
but
graceful
never
,
in
the
costumes
*NL*
which
were
the
fashion
at
that
period
,
when
the
head
covering
was
a
*NL*
dizzy
structure
a
foot
tall
,
and
the
almost
incredible
extension
of
*NL*
the
skirt
behind
by
means
of
artificial
contrivances
more
thoroughly
*NL*
dehumanized
the
form
than
any
former
device
of
dressmakers
.
Fancy
any
*NL*
one
graceful
in
such
a
costume
!
''
The
point
is
certainly
well
taken
,
*NL*
and
I
can
only
reply
that
while
the
ladies
of
the
twentieth
century
*NL*
are
lovely
demonstrations
of
the
effect
of
appropriate
drapery
in
*NL*
accenting
feminine
graces
,
my
recollection
of
their
great-grandmothers
*NL*
enables
me
to
maintain
that
no
deformity
of
costume
can
wholly
*NL*
disguise
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
marriage
only
waited
on
the
completion
of
the
house
which
I
was
*NL*
building
for
our
occupancy
in
one
of
the
most
desirable
parts
of
the
*NL*
city
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
part
chiefly
inhabited
by
the
rich
.
For
it
*NL*
must
be
understood
that
the
comparative
desirability
of
different
*NL*
parts
of
Boston
for
residence
depended
then
,
not
on
natural
features
,
*NL*
but
on
the
character
of
the
neighboring
population
.
Each
class
or
*NL*
nation
lived
by
itself
,
in
quarters
of
its
own
.
A
rich
man
living
*NL*
among
the
poor
,
an
educated
man
among
the
uneducated
,
was
like
one
*NL*
living
in
isolation
among
a
jealous
and
alien
race
.
When
the
house
had
*NL*
been
begun
,
its
completion
by
the
winter
of
1886
had
been
expected
.
*NL*
The
spring
of
the
following
year
found
it
,
however
,
yet
incomplete
,
*NL*
and
my
marriage
still
a
thing
of
the
future
.
The
cause
of
a
delay
*NL*
calculated
to
be
particularly
exasperating
to
an
ardent
lover
was
a
*NL*
series
of
strikes
,
that
is
to
say
,
concerted
refusals
to
work
on
the
*NL*
part
of
the
brick-layers
,
masons
,
carpenters
,
painters
,
plumbers
,
and
*NL*
other
trades
concerned
in
house
building
.
What
the
specific
causes
of
*NL*
these
strikes
were
I
do
not
remember
.
Strikes
had
become
so
common
at
*NL*
that
period
that
people
had
ceased
to
inquire
into
their
particular
*NL*
grounds
.
In
one
department
of
industry
or
another
,
they
had
been
*NL*
nearly
incessant
ever
since
the
great
business
crisis
of
1873
.
In
fact
*NL*
it
had
come
to
be
the
exceptional
thing
to
see
any
class
of
laborers
*NL*
pursue
their
avocation
steadily
for
more
than
a
few
months
at
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reader
who
observes
the
dates
alluded
to
will
of
course
recognize
*NL*
in
these
disturbances
of
industry
the
first
and
incoherent
phase
of
*NL*
the
great
movement
which
ended
in
the
establishment
of
the
modern
*NL*
industrial
system
with
all
its
social
consequences
.
This
is
all
so
*NL*
plain
in
the
retrospect
that
a
child
can
understand
it
,
but
not
being
*NL*
prophets
,
we
of
that
day
had
no
clear
idea
what
was
happening
to
us
.
*NL*
What
we
did
see
was
that
industrially
the
country
was
in
a
very
queer
*NL*
way
.
The
relation
between
the
workingman
and
the
employer
,
between
*NL*
labor
and
capital
,
appeared
in
some
unaccountable
manner
to
have
*NL*
become
dislocated
.
The
working
classes
had
quite
suddenly
and
very
*NL*
generally
become
infected
with
a
profound
discontent
with
their
*NL*
condition
,
and
an
idea
that
it
could
be
greatly
bettered
if
they
only
*NL*
knew
how
to
go
about
it
.
On
every
side
,
with
one
accord
,
they
*NL*
preferred
demands
for
higher
pay
,
shorter
hours
,
better
dwellings
,
*NL*
better
educational
advantages
,
and
a
share
in
the
refinements
and
*NL*
luxuries
of
life
,
demands
which
it
was
impossible
to
see
the
way
to
*NL*
granting
unless
the
world
were
to
become
a
great
deal
richer
than
it
*NL*
then
was
.
Though
they
knew
something
of
what
they
wanted
,
they
knew
*NL*
nothing
of
how
to
accomplish
it
,
and
the
eager
enthusiasm
with
which
*NL*
they
thronged
about
any
one
who
seemed
likely
to
give
them
any
light
*NL*
on
the
subject
lent
sudden
reputation
to
many
would-be
leaders
,
some
*NL*
of
whom
had
little
enough
light
to
give
.
However
chimerical
the
*NL*
aspirations
of
the
laboring
classes
might
be
deemed
,
the
devotion
*NL*
with
which
they
supported
one
another
in
the
strikes
,
which
were
their
*NL*
chief
weapon
,
and
the
sacrifices
which
they
underwent
to
carry
them
*NL*
out
left
no
doubt
of
their
dead
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
final
outcome
of
the
labor
troubles
,
which
was
the
phrase
by
*NL*
which
the
movement
I
have
described
was
most
commonly
referred
to
,
the
*NL*
opinions
of
the
people
of
my
class
differed
according
to
individual
*NL*
temperament
.
The
sanguine
argued
very
forcibly
that
it
was
in
the
very
*NL*
nature
of
things
impossible
that
the
new
hopes
of
the
workingmen
could
*NL*
be
satisfied
,
simply
because
the
world
had
not
the
wherewithal
to
*NL*
satisfy
them
.
It
was
only
because
the
masses
worked
very
hard
and
*NL*
lived
on
short
commons
that
the
race
did
not
starve
outright
,
and
no
*NL*
considerable
improvement
in
their
condition
was
possible
while
the
*NL*
world
,
as
a
whole
,
remained
so
poor
.
It
was
not
the
capitalists
whom
*NL*
the
laboring
men
were
contending
with
,
these
maintained
,
but
the
*NL*
iron-bound
environment
of
humanity
,
and
it
was
merely
a
question
of
*NL*
the
thickness
of
their
skulls
when
they
would
discover
the
fact
and
*NL*
make
up
their
minds
to
endure
what
they
could
not
cure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
less
sanguine
admitted
all
this
.
Of
course
the
workingmen
's
*NL*
aspirations
were
impossible
of
fulfillment
for
natural
reasons
,
but
*NL*
there
were
grounds
to
fear
that
they
would
not
discover
this
fact
*NL*
until
they
had
made
a
sad
mess
of
society
They
had
the
votes
and
the
*NL*
power
to
do
so
if
they
pleased
,
and
their
leaders
meant
they
should
.
*NL*
Some
of
these
desponding
observers
went
so
far
as
to
predict
an
*NL*
impending
social
cataclysm
.
Humanity
,
they
argued
,
having
climbed
to
*NL*
the
top
round
of
the
ladder
of
civilization
,
was
about
to
take
a
*NL*
header
into
chaos
,
after
which
it
would
doubtless
pick
itself
up
,
turn
*NL*
round
,
and
begin
to
climb
again
.
Repeated
experiences
of
this
sort
in
*NL*
historic
and
prehistoric
times
possibly
accounted
for
the
puzzling
*NL*
bumps
on
the
human
cranium
.
Human
history
,
like
all
great
movements
,
*NL*
was
cyclical
,
and
returned
to
the
point
of
beginning
.
The
idea
of
*NL*
indefinite
progress
in
a
right
line
was
a
chimera
of
the
imagination
,
*NL*
with
no
analogue
in
nature
.
The
parabola
of
a
comet
was
perhaps
a
yet
*NL*
better
illustration
of
the
career
of
humanity
.
Tending
upward
and
*NL*
sunward
from
the
aphelion
of
barbarism
,
the
race
attained
the
*NL*
perihelion
of
civilization
only
to
plunge
downward
once
more
to
its
*NL*
nether
goal
in
the
regions
of
chaos
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
of
course
,
was
an
extreme
opinion
,
but
I
remember
serious
men
*NL*
among
my
acquaintances
who
,
in
discussing
the
signs
of
the
times
,
*NL*
adopted
a
very
similar
tone
.
It
was
no
doubt
the
common
opinion
of
*NL*
thoughtful
men
that
society
was
approaching
a
critical
period
which
*NL*
might
result
in
great
changes
.
The
labor
troubles
,
their
causes
,
*NL*
course
,
and
cure
,
took
lead
of
all
other
topics
in
the
public
prints
,
*NL*
and
in
serious
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nervous
tension
of
the
public
mind
could
not
have
been
more
*NL*
strikingly
illustrated
than
it
was
by
the
alarm
resulting
from
the
*NL*
talk
of
a
small
band
of
men
who
called
themselves
anarchists
,
and
*NL*
proposed
to
terrify
the
American
people
into
adopting
their
ideas
by
*NL*
threats
of
violence
,
as
if
a
mighty
nation
which
had
but
just
put
down
*NL*
a
rebellion
of
half
its
own
numbers
,
in
order
to
maintain
its
*NL*
political
system
,
were
likely
to
adopt
a
new
social
system
out
of
*NL*
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
one
of
the
wealthy
,
with
a
large
stake
in
the
existing
order
of
*NL*
things
,
I
naturally
shared
the
apprehensions
of
my
class
.
The
*NL*
particular
grievance
I
had
against
the
working
classes
at
the
time
of
*NL*
which
I
write
,
on
account
of
the
effect
of
their
strikes
in
postponing
*NL*
my
wedded
bliss
,
no
doubt
lent
a
special
animosity
to
my
feeling
*NL*
toward
them
.

CHAPTER
II
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
thirtieth
day
of
May
,
1887
,
fell
on
a
Monday
.
It
was
one
of
the
*NL*
annual
holidays
of
the
nation
in
the
latter
third
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
being
set
apart
under
the
name
of
Decoration
Day
,
for
doing
*NL*
honor
to
the
memory
of
the
soldiers
of
the
North
who
took
part
in
the
*NL*
war
for
the
preservation
of
the
union
of
the
States
.
The
survivors
of
*NL*
the
war
,
escorted
by
military
and
civic
processions
and
bands
of
*NL*
music
,
were
wont
on
this
occasion
to
visit
the
cemeteries
and
lay
*NL*
wreaths
of
flowers
upon
the
graves
of
their
dead
comrades
,
the
*NL*
ceremony
being
a
very
solemn
and
touching
one
.
The
eldest
brother
of
*NL*
Edith
Bartlett
had
fallen
in
the
war
,
and
on
Decoration
Day
the
family
*NL*
was
in
the
habit
of
making
a
visit
to
Mount
Auburn
,
where
he
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
asked
permission
to
make
one
of
the
party
,
and
,
on
our
return
to
*NL*
the
city
at
nightfall
,
remained
to
dine
with
the
family
of
my
*NL*
betrothed
.
In
the
drawing-room
,
after
dinner
,
I
picked
up
an
evening
*NL*
paper
and
read
of
a
fresh
strike
in
the
building
trades
,
which
would
*NL*
probably
still
further
delay
the
completion
of
my
unlucky
house
.
I
*NL*
remember
distinctly
how
exasperated
I
was
at
this
,
and
the
*NL*
objurgations
,
as
forcible
as
the
presence
of
the
ladies
permitted
,
*NL*
which
I
lavished
upon
workmen
in
general
,
and
these
strikers
in
*NL*
particular
.
I
had
abundant
sympathy
from
those
about
me
,
and
the
*NL*
remarks
made
in
the
desultory
conversation
which
followed
,
upon
the
*NL*
unprincipled
conduct
of
the
labor
agitators
,
were
calculated
to
make
*NL*
those
gentlemen
's
ears
tingle
.
It
was
agreed
that
affairs
were
going
*NL*
from
bad
to
worse
very
fast
,
and
that
there
was
no
telling
what
we
*NL*
should
come
to
soon
.
``
The
worst
of
it
,
''
I
remember
Mrs.
Bartlett
's
*NL*
saying
,
``
is
that
the
working
classes
all
over
the
world
seem
to
be
*NL*
going
crazy
at
once
.
In
Europe
it
is
far
worse
even
than
here
.
I
'm
*NL*
sure
I
should
not
dare
to
live
there
at
all
.
I
asked
Mr.
Bartlett
the
*NL*
other
day
where
we
should
emigrate
to
if
all
the
terrible
things
took
*NL*
place
which
those
socialists
threaten
.
He
said
he
did
not
know
any
*NL*
place
now
where
society
could
be
called
stable
except
Greenland
,
*NL*
Patagonia
,
and
the
Chinese
Empire
.
''
``
Those
Chinamen
knew
what
they
*NL*
were
about
,
''
somebody
added
,
``
when
they
refused
to
let
in
our
western
*NL*
civilization
.
They
knew
what
it
would
lead
to
better
than
we
did
.
They
*NL*
saw
it
was
nothing
but
dynamite
in
disguise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
,
I
remember
drawing
Edith
apart
and
trying
to
persuade
her
*NL*
that
it
would
be
better
to
be
married
at
once
without
waiting
for
the
*NL*
completion
of
the
house
,
spending
the
time
in
travel
till
our
home
*NL*
was
ready
for
us
.
She
was
remarkably
handsome
that
evening
,
the
*NL*
mourning
costume
that
she
wore
in
recognition
of
the
day
setting
off
*NL*
to
great
advantage
the
purity
of
her
complexion
.
I
can
see
her
even
*NL*
now
with
my
mind
's
eye
just
as
she
looked
that
night
.
When
I
took
my
*NL*
leave
she
followed
me
into
the
hall
and
I
kissed
her
good-by
as
usual
.
*NL*
There
was
no
circumstance
out
of
the
common
to
distinguish
this
*NL*
parting
from
previous
occasions
when
we
had
bade
each
other
good-by
*NL*
for
a
night
or
a
day
.
There
was
absolutely
no
premonition
in
my
mind
,
*NL*
or
I
am
sure
in
hers
,
that
this
was
more
than
an
ordinary
separation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ah
,
well
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
hour
at
which
I
had
left
my
betrothed
was
a
rather
early
one
for
a
*NL*
lover
,
but
the
fact
was
no
reflection
on
my
devotion
.
I
was
a
*NL*
confirmed
sufferer
from
insomnia
,
and
although
otherwise
perfectly
*NL*
well
had
been
completely
fagged
out
that
day
,
from
having
slept
*NL*
scarcely
at
all
the
two
previous
nights
.
Edith
knew
this
and
had
*NL*
insisted
on
sending
me
home
by
nine
o'clock
,
with
strict
orders
to
go
*NL*
to
bed
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
in
which
I
lived
had
been
occupied
by
three
generations
of
*NL*
the
family
of
which
I
was
the
only
living
representative
in
the
direct
*NL*
line
.
It
was
a
large
,
ancient
wooden
mansion
,
very
elegant
in
an
*NL*
old-fashioned
way
within
,
but
situated
in
a
quarter
that
had
long
*NL*
since
become
undesirable
for
residence
,
from
its
invasion
by
tenement
*NL*
houses
and
manufactories
.
It
was
not
a
house
to
which
I
could
think
of
*NL*
bringing
a
bride
,
much
less
so
dainty
a
one
as
Edith
Bartlett
.
I
had
*NL*
advertised
it
for
sale
,
and
meanwhile
merely
used
it
for
sleeping
*NL*
purposes
,
dining
at
my
club
.
One
servant
,
a
faithful
colored
man
by
*NL*
the
name
of
Sawyer
,
lived
with
me
and
attended
to
my
few
wants
.
One
*NL*
feature
of
the
house
I
expected
to
miss
greatly
when
I
should
leave
*NL*
it
,
and
this
was
the
sleeping
chamber
which
I
had
built
under
the
*NL*
foundations
.
I
could
not
have
slept
in
the
city
at
all
,
with
its
never
*NL*
ceasing
nightly
noises
,
if
I
had
been
obliged
to
use
an
upstairs
*NL*
chamber
.
But
to
this
subterranean
room
no
murmur
from
the
upper
world
*NL*
ever
penetrated
.
When
I
had
entered
it
and
closed
the
door
,
I
was
*NL*
surrounded
by
the
silence
of
the
tomb
.
In
order
to
prevent
the
*NL*
dampness
of
the
subsoil
from
penetrating
the
chamber
,
the
walls
had
*NL*
been
laid
in
hydraulic
cement
and
were
very
thick
,
and
the
floor
was
*NL*
likewise
protected
.
In
order
that
the
room
might
serve
also
as
a
vault
*NL*
equally
proof
against
violence
and
flames
,
for
the
storage
of
*NL*
valuables
,
I
had
roofed
it
with
stone
slabs
hermetically
sealed
,
and
*NL*
the
outer
door
was
of
iron
with
a
thick
coating
of
asbestos
.
A
small
*NL*
pipe
,
communicating
with
a
wind-mill
on
the
top
of
the
house
,
insured
*NL*
the
renewal
of
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
might
seem
that
the
tenant
of
such
a
chamber
ought
to
be
able
to
*NL*
command
slumber
,
but
it
was
rare
that
I
slept
well
,
even
there
,
two
*NL*
nights
in
succession
.
So
accustomed
was
I
to
wakefulness
that
I
minded
*NL*
little
the
loss
of
one
night
's
rest
.
A
second
night
,
however
,
spent
in
*NL*
my
reading
chair
instead
of
my
bed
,
tired
me
out
,
and
I
never
allowed
*NL*
myself
to
go
longer
than
that
without
slumber
,
from
fear
of
nervous
*NL*
disorder
.
From
this
statement
it
will
be
inferred
that
I
had
at
my
*NL*
command
some
artificial
means
for
inducing
sleep
in
the
last
resort
,
*NL*
and
so
in
fact
I
had
.
If
after
two
sleepless
nights
I
found
myself
on
*NL*
the
approach
of
the
third
without
sensations
of
drowsiness
,
I
called
*NL*
in
Dr.
Pillsbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
doctor
by
courtesy
only
,
what
was
called
in
those
days
an
*NL*
``
irregular
''
or
``
quack
''
doctor
.
He
called
himself
a
``
Professor
of
*NL*
Animal
Magnetism
.
''
I
had
come
across
him
in
the
course
of
some
amateur
*NL*
investigations
into
the
phenomena
of
animal
magnetism
.
I
do
n't
think
*NL*
he
knew
anything
about
medicine
,
but
he
was
certainly
a
remarkable
*NL*
mesmerist
.
It
was
for
the
purpose
of
being
put
to
sleep
by
his
*NL*
manipulations
that
I
used
to
send
for
him
when
I
found
a
third
night
*NL*
of
sleeplessness
impending
.
Let
my
nervous
excitement
or
mental
*NL*
preoccupation
be
however
great
,
Dr.
Pillsbury
never
failed
,
after
a
*NL*
short
time
,
to
leave
me
in
a
deep
slumber
,
which
continued
till
I
was
*NL*
aroused
by
a
reversal
of
the
mesmerizing
process
.
The
process
for
*NL*
awaking
the
sleeper
was
much
simpler
than
that
for
putting
him
to
*NL*
sleep
,
and
for
convenience
I
had
made
Dr.
Pillsbury
teach
Sawyer
how
*NL*
to
do
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
faithful
servant
alone
knew
for
what
purpose
Dr.
Pillsbury
visited
*NL*
me
,
or
that
he
did
so
at
all
.
Of
course
,
when
Edith
became
my
wife
I
*NL*
should
have
to
tell
her
my
secrets
.
I
had
not
hitherto
told
her
this
,
*NL*
because
there
was
unquestionably
a
slight
risk
in
the
mesmeric
sleep
,
*NL*
and
I
knew
she
would
set
her
face
against
my
practice
.
The
risk
,
of
*NL*
course
,
was
that
it
might
become
too
profound
and
pass
into
a
trance
*NL*
beyond
the
mesmerizer
's
power
to
break
,
ending
in
death
.
Repeated
*NL*
experiments
had
fully
convinced
me
that
the
risk
was
next
to
nothing
*NL*
if
reasonable
precautions
were
exercised
,
and
of
this
I
hoped
,
though
*NL*
doubtingly
,
to
convince
Edith
.
I
went
directly
home
after
leaving
her
,
*NL*
and
at
once
sent
Sawyer
to
fetch
Dr.
Pillsbury
.
Meanwhile
I
sought
my
*NL*
subterranean
sleeping
chamber
,
and
exchanging
my
costume
for
a
*NL*
comfortable
dressing-gown
,
sat
down
to
read
the
letters
by
the
evening
*NL*
mail
which
Sawyer
had
laid
on
my
reading
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
was
from
the
builder
of
my
new
house
,
and
confirmed
what
I
*NL*
had
inferred
from
the
newspaper
item
.
The
new
strikes
,
he
said
,
had
*NL*
postponed
indefinitely
the
completion
of
the
contract
,
as
neither
*NL*
masters
nor
workmen
would
concede
the
point
at
issue
without
a
long
*NL*
struggle
.
Caligula
wished
that
the
Roman
people
had
but
one
neck
that
*NL*
he
might
cut
it
off
,
and
as
I
read
this
letter
I
am
afraid
that
for
a
*NL*
moment
I
was
capable
of
wishing
the
same
thing
concerning
the
laboring
*NL*
classes
of
America
.
The
return
of
Sawyer
with
the
doctor
interrupted
*NL*
my
gloomy
meditations
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
he
had
with
difficulty
been
able
to
secure
his
*NL*
services
,
as
he
was
preparing
to
leave
the
city
that
very
night
.
The
*NL*
doctor
explained
that
since
he
had
seen
me
last
he
had
learned
of
a
*NL*
fine
professional
opening
in
a
distant
city
,
and
decided
to
take
*NL*
prompt
advantage
of
it
.
On
my
asking
,
in
some
panic
,
what
I
was
to
do
*NL*
for
some
one
to
put
me
to
sleep
,
he
gave
me
the
names
of
several
*NL*
mesmerizers
in
Boston
who
,
he
averred
,
had
quite
as
great
powers
as
*NL*
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Somewhat
relieved
on
this
point
,
I
instructed
Sawyer
to
rouse
me
at
*NL*
nine
o'clock
next
morning
,
and
,
lying
down
on
the
bed
in
my
*NL*
dressing-gown
,
assumed
a
comfortable
attitude
,
and
surrendered
myself
*NL*
to
the
manipulations
of
the
mesmerizer
.
Owing
,
perhaps
,
to
my
*NL*
unusually
nervous
state
,
I
was
slower
than
common
in
losing
*NL*
consciousness
,
but
at
length
a
delicious
drowsiness
stole
over
me
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
going

open
his
eyes

He
had
better
see
but
one
of

first

*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
me
,
then
,
that
you
will
not
tell
him

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
voice
was
a
man
's
,
the
second
a
woman
's
,
and
both
spoke
in
*NL*
whispers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
see
how
he
seems
,
''
replied
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
promise
me
,
''
persisted
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
her
have
her
way
,
''
whispered
a
third
voice
,
also
a
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
I
promise
,
then
,
''
answered
the
man
.
``
Quick
,
go
!
He
is
*NL*
coming
out
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rustle
of
garments
and
I
opened
my
eyes
.
A
fine
looking
*NL*
man
of
perhaps
sixty
was
bending
over
me
,
an
expression
of
much
*NL*
benevolence
mingled
with
great
curiosity
upon
his
features
.
He
was
an
*NL*
utter
stranger
.
I
raised
myself
on
an
elbow
and
looked
around
.
The
*NL*
room
was
empty
.
I
certainly
had
never
been
in
it
before
,
or
one
*NL*
furnished
like
it
.
I
looked
back
at
my
companion
.
He
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
feel
?
''
he
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
am
I
?
''
I
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
in
my
house
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
came
I
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
will
talk
about
that
when
you
are
stronger
.
Meanwhile
,
I
beg
you
*NL*
will
feel
no
anxiety
.
You
are
among
friends
and
in
good
hands
.
How
do
*NL*
you
feel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
bit
queerly
,
''
I
replied
,
``
but
I
am
well
,
I
suppose
.
Will
you
tell
*NL*
me
how
I
came
to
be
indebted
to
your
hospitality
?
What
has
happened
to
*NL*
me
?
How
came
I
here
?
It
was
in
my
own
house
that
I
went
to
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
time
enough
for
explanations
later
,
''
my
unknown
host
*NL*
replied
,
with
a
reassuring
smile
.
``
It
will
be
better
to
avoid
*NL*
agitating
talk
until
you
are
a
little
more
yourself
.
Will
you
oblige
*NL*
me
by
taking
a
couple
of
swallows
of
this
mixture
?
It
will
do
you
*NL*
good
.
I
am
a
physician
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
repelled
the
glass
with
my
hand
and
sat
up
on
the
couch
,
although
*NL*
with
an
effort
,
for
my
head
was
strangely
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
insist
upon
knowing
at
once
where
I
am
and
what
you
have
been
doing
*NL*
with
me
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
responded
my
companion
,
``
let
me
beg
that
you
will
not
*NL*
agitate
yourself
.
I
would
rather
you
did
not
insist
upon
explanations
*NL*
so
soon
,
but
if
you
do
,
I
will
try
to
satisfy
you
,
provided
you
will
*NL*
first
take
this
draught
,
which
will
strengthen
you
somewhat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
thereupon
drank
what
he
offered
me
.
Then
he
said
,
``
It
is
not
so
*NL*
simple
a
matter
as
you
evidently
suppose
to
tell
you
how
you
came
*NL*
here
.
You
can
tell
me
quite
as
much
on
that
point
as
I
can
tell
you
.
*NL*
You
have
just
been
roused
from
a
deep
sleep
,
or
,
more
properly
,
*NL*
trance
.
So
much
I
can
tell
you
.
You
say
you
were
in
your
own
house
*NL*
when
you
fell
into
that
sleep
.
May
I
ask
you
when
that
was
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
?
''
I
replied
,
``
when
?
Why
,
last
evening
,
of
course
,
at
about
ten
*NL*
o'clock
.
I
left
my
man
Sawyer
orders
to
call
me
at
nine
o'clock
.
What
*NL*
has
become
of
Sawyer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca

precisely

replied
my
companion
,
regarding
me
*NL*
with
a
curious
expression
,
``
but
I
am
sure
that
he
is
excusable
for
not
*NL*
being
here
.
And
now
can
you
tell
me
a
little
more
explicitly
when
it
*NL*
was
that
you
fell
into
that
sleep

the
date

I
mean

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

last
night

of
course

I
said
so

did
n't

overslept
an
entire
day

Great

that
can
not
be
possible

*NL*
and
yet
I
have
an
odd
sensation
of
having
slept
a
long
time

It
was

Decoration

I
went
to
sleep

incredible

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
see

replied
my
companion
;
``
you
say
that
it
was

``

I
stared
blankly
at
him
,
incapable
of
speech
,
for
some
moments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
what
year
?
''
I
feebly
echoed
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

if
you
please
?
After
you
have
told

that
I
shall
*NL*
be
able
to
tell

how
long
you
have
slept
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
year
1887

''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
insisted
that
I
should
take
another
draught
from
the
*NL*
glass
,
and
felt
my
pulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sir
,
''
he
said
,
``
your
manner
indicates
that
you
are
a
man
of
*NL*
culture
,
which
I
am
aware
was
by
no
means
the
matter
of
course
in
your
*NL*
day
it
now
is
.
No
doubt
,
then
,
you
have
yourself
made
the
observation
*NL*
that
nothing
in
this
world
can
be
truly
said
to
be
more
wonderful
than
*NL*
anything
else
.
The
causes
of
all
phenomena
are
equally
adequate
,
and
*NL*
the
results
equally
matters
of
course
.
That
you
should
be
startled
by
*NL*
what
I
shall
tell
you
is
to
be
expected
;
but
I
am
confident
that
you
*NL*
will
not
permit
it
to
affect
your
equanimity
unduly
.
Your
appearance
*NL*
is
that
of
a
young
man
of
barely
thirty
,
and
your
bodily
condition
*NL*
seems
not
greatly
different
from
that
of
one
just
roused
from
a
*NL*
somewhat
too
long
and
profound
sleep
,
and
yet
this
is
the
tenth
day
*NL*
of
September
in
the
year
2000
,
and
you
have
slept
exactly
one
hundred
*NL*
and
thirteen
years
,
three
months
,
and
eleven
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Feeling
partially
dazed
,
I
drank
a
cup
of
some
sort
of
broth
at
my
*NL*
companion
's
suggestion
,
and
,
immediately
afterward
becoming
very
*NL*
drowsy
,
went
off
into
a
deep
sleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
awoke
it
was
broad
daylight
in
the
room
,
which
had
been
lighted
*NL*
artificially
when
I
was
awake
before
.
My
mysterious
host
was
sitting
*NL*
near
.
He
was
not
looking
at
me
when
I
opened
my
eyes
,
and
I
had
a
good
*NL*
opportunity
to
study
him
and
meditate
upon
my
extraordinary
situation
,
*NL*
before
he
observed
that
I
was
awake
.
My
giddiness
was
all
gone
,
and
my
*NL*
mind
perfectly
clear
.
The
story
that
I
had
been
asleep
one
hundred
and
*NL*
thirteen
years
,
which
,
in
my
former
weak
and
bewildered
condition
,
I
*NL*
had
accepted
without
question
,
recurred
to
me
now
only
to
be
rejected
*NL*
as
a
preposterous
attempt
at
an
imposture
,
the
motive
of
which
it
was
*NL*
impossible
remotely
to
surmise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
extraordinary
had
certainly
happened
to
account
for
my
*NL*
waking
up
in
this
strange
house
with
this
unknown
companion
,
but
my
*NL*
fancy
was
utterly
impotent
to
suggest
more
than
than
the
wildest
guess
*NL*
as
to
what
that
something
might
have
been
.
Could
it
be
that
I
was
the
*NL*
victim
of
some
sort
of
conspiracy
?
It
looked
so
,
certainly
;
and
yet
,
*NL*
if
human
lineaments
ever
gave
true
evidence
,
it
was
certain
that
this
*NL*
man
by
my
side
,
with
a
face
so
refined
and
ingenuous
,
was
no
party
to
*NL*
any
scheme
of
crime
or
outrage
.
Then
it
occurred
to
me
to
question
if
*NL*
I
might
not
be
the
butt
of
some
elaborate
practical
joke
on
the
part
*NL*
of
friends
who
had
somehow
learned
the
secret
of
my
underground
*NL*
chamber
and
taken
this
means
of
impressing
me
with
the
peril
of
*NL*
mesmeric
experiments
.
There
were
great
difficulties
in
the
way
of
this
*NL*
theory
;
Sawyer
would
never
have
betrayed
me
,
nor
had
I
any
friends
at
*NL*
all
likely
to
undertake
such
an
enterprise
;
nevertheless
the
*NL*
supposition
that
I
was
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
seemed
on
the
*NL*
whole
the
only
one
tenable
.
Half
expecting
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
some
*NL*
familiar
face
grinning
from
behind
a
chair
or
curtain
,
I
looked
*NL*
carefully
about
the
room
.
When
my
eyes
next
rested
on
my
companion
,
he
*NL*
was
looking
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
had
a
fine
nap
of
twelve
hours
,
''
he
said
briskly
,
``
and
I
can
*NL*
see
that
it
has
done
you
good
.
You
look
much
better
.
Your
color
is
*NL*
good
and
your
eyes
are
bright
.
How
do
you
feel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
felt
better
,
''
I
said
,
sitting
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
remember
your
first
waking
,
no
doubt
,
''
he
pursued
,
``
and
your
*NL*
surprise
when
I
told
you
how
long
you
had
been
asleep
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
,
I
believe
,
that
I
had
slept
one
hundred
and
thirteen
*NL*
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
admit
,
''
I
said
,
with
an
ironical
smile
,
``
that
the
story
was
*NL*
rather
an
improbable
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extraordinary
,
I
admit
,
''
he
responded
,
``
but
given
the
proper
*NL*
conditions
,
not
improbable
nor
inconsistent
with
what
we
know
of
the
*NL*
trance
state
.
When
complete
,
as
in
your
case
,
the
vital
functions
are
*NL*
absolutely
suspended
,
and
there
is
no
waste
of
the
tissues
.
No
limit
*NL*
can
be
set
to
the
possible
duration
of
a
trance
when
the
external
*NL*
conditions
protect
the
body
from
physical
injury
.
This
trance
of
yours
*NL*
is
indeed
the
longest
of
which
there
is
any
positive
record
,
but
there
*NL*
is
no
known
reason
wherefore
,
had
you
not
been
discovered
and
had
the
*NL*
chamber
in
which
we
found
you
continued
intact
,
you
might
not
have
*NL*
remained
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
till
,
at
the
end
of
*NL*
indefinite
ages
,
the
gradual
refrigeration
of
the
earth
had
destroyed
*NL*
the
bodily
tissues
and
set
the
spirit
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
to
admit
that
,
if
I
were
indeed
the
victim
of
a
practical
joke
,
*NL*
its
authors
had
chosen
an
admirable
agent
for
carrying
out
their
*NL*
imposition
.
The
impressive
and
even
eloquent
manner
of
this
man
would
*NL*
have
lent
dignity
to
an
argument
that
the
moon
was
made
of
cheese
.
The
*NL*
smile
with
which
I
had
regarded
him
as
he
advanced
his
trance
*NL*
hypothesis
did
not
appear
to
confuse
him
in
the
slightest
degree
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
will
go
on
and
favor
me
with
some
particulars
*NL*
as
to
the
circumstances
under
which
you
discovered
this
chamber
of
*NL*
which
you
speak
,
and
its
contents
.
I
enjoy
good
fiction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
this
case
,
''
was
the
grave
reply
,
``
no
fiction
could
be
so
strange
*NL*
as
the
truth
.
You
must
know
that
these
many
years
I
have
been
*NL*
cherishing
the
idea
of
building
a
laboratory
in
the
large
garden
*NL*
beside
this
house
,
for
the
purpose
of
chemical
experiments
for
which
I
*NL*
have
a
taste
.
Last
Thursday
the
excavation
for
the
cellar
was
at
last
*NL*
begun
.
It
was
completed
by
that
night
,
and
Friday
the
masons
were
to
*NL*
have
come
.
Thursday
night
we
had
a
tremendous
deluge
of
rain
,
and
*NL*
Friday
morning
I
found
my
cellar
a
frog-pond
and
the
walls
quite
*NL*
washed
down
.
My
daughter
,
who
had
come
out
to
view
the
disaster
with
*NL*
me
,
called
my
attention
to
a
corner
of
masonry
laid
bare
by
the
*NL*
crumbling
away
of
one
of
the
walls
.
I
cleared
a
little
earth
from
it
,
*NL*
and
,
finding
that
it
seemed
part
of
a
large
mass
,
determined
to
*NL*
investigate
it
.
The
workmen
I
sent
for
unearthed
an
oblong
vault
some
*NL*
eight
feet
below
the
surface
,
and
set
in
the
corner
of
what
had
*NL*
evidently
been
the
foundation
walls
of
an
ancient
house
.
A
layer
of
*NL*
ashes
and
charcoal
on
the
top
of
the
vault
showed
that
the
house
above
*NL*
had
perished
by
fire
.
The
vault
itself
was
perfectly
intact
,
the
*NL*
cement
being
as
good
as
when
first
applied
.
It
had
a
door
,
but
this
we
*NL*
could
not
force
,
and
found
entrance
by
removing
one
of
the
flagstones
*NL*
which
formed
the
roof
.
The
air
which
came
up
was
stagnant
but
pure
,
*NL*
dry
and
not
cold
.
Descending
with
a
lantern
,
I
found
myself
in
an
*NL*
apartment
fitted
up
as
a
bedroom
in
the
style
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
.
On
the
bed
lay
a
young
man
.
That
he
was
dead
and
must
have
*NL*
been
dead
a
century
was
of
course
to
be
taken
for
granted
;
but
the
*NL*
extraordinary
state
of
preservation
of
the
body
struck
me
and
the
*NL*
medical
colleagues
whom
I
had
summoned
with
amazement
.
That
the
art
of
*NL*
such
embalming
as
this
had
ever
been
known
we
should
not
have
*NL*
believed
,
yet
here
seemed
conclusive
testimony
that
our
immediate
*NL*
ancestors
had
possessed
it
.
My
medical
colleagues
,
whose
curiosity
was
*NL*
highly
excited
,
were
at
once
for
undertaking
experiments
to
test
the
*NL*
nature
of
the
process
employed
,
but
I
withheld
them
.
My
motive
in
so
*NL*
doing
,
at
least
the
only
motive
I
now
need
speak
of
,
was
the
*NL*
recollection
of
something
I
once
had
read
about
the
extent
to
which
*NL*
your
contemporaries
had
cultivated
the
subject
of
animal
magnetism
.
It
*NL*
had
occurred
to
me
as
just
conceivable
that
you
might
be
in
a
trance
,
*NL*
and
that
the
secret
of
your
bodily
integrity
after
so
long
a
time
was
*NL*
not
the
craft
of
an
embalmer
,
but
life
.
So
extremely
fanciful
did
this
*NL*
idea
seem
,
even
to
me
,
that
I
did
not
risk
the
ridicule
of
my
fellow
*NL*
physicians
by
mentioning
it
,
but
gave
some
other
reason
for
postponing
*NL*
their
experiments
.
No
sooner
,
however
,
had
they
left
me
,
than
I
set
on
*NL*
foot
a
systematic
attempt
at
resuscitation
,
of
which
you
know
the
*NL*
result
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Had
its
theme
been
yet
more
incredible
,
the
circumstantiality
of
this
*NL*
narrative
,
as
well
as
the
impressive
manner
and
personality
of
the
*NL*
narrator
,
might
have
staggered
a
listener
,
and
I
had
begun
to
feel
*NL*
very
strangely
,
when
,
as
he
closed
,
I
chanced
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
my
*NL*
reflection
in
a
mirror
hanging
on
the
wall
of
the
room
.
I
rose
and
*NL*
went
up
to
it
.
The
face
I
saw
was
the
face
to
a
hair
and
a
line
and
*NL*
not
a
day
older
than
the
one
I
had
looked
at
as
I
tied
my
cravat
*NL*
before
going
to
Edith
that
Decoration
Day
,
which
,
as
this
man
would
*NL*
have
me
believe
,
was
celebrated
one
hundred
and
thirteen
years
before
.
*NL*
At
this
,
the
colossal
character
of
the
fraud
which
was
being
attempted
*NL*
on
me
,
came
over
me
afresh
.
Indignation
mastered
my
mind
as
I
realized
*NL*
the
outrageous
liberty
that
had
been
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
probably
surprised
,
''
said
my
companion
,
``
to
see
that
,
*NL*
although
you
are
a
century
older
than
when
you
lay
down
to
sleep
in
*NL*
that
underground
chamber
,
your
appearance
is
unchanged
.
That
should
*NL*
not
amaze
you
.
It
is
by
virtue
of
the
total
arrest
of
the
vital
*NL*
functions
that
you
have
survived
this
great
period
of
time
.
If
your
*NL*
body
could
have
undergone
any
change
during
your
trance
,
it
would
long
*NL*
ago
have
suffered
dissolution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
''
I
replied
,
turning
to
him
,
``
what
your
motive
can
be
in
reciting
*NL*
to
me
with
a
serious
face
this
remarkable
farrago
,
I
am
utterly
unable
*NL*
to
guess
;
but
you
are
surely
yourself
too
intelligent
to
suppose
that
*NL*
anybody
but
an
imbecile
could
be
deceived
by
it
.
Spare
me
any
more
of
*NL*
this
elaborate
nonsense
and
once
for
all
tell
me
whether
you
refuse
to
*NL*
give
me
an
intelligible
account
of
where
I
am
and
how
I
came
here
.
If
*NL*
so
,
I
shall
proceed
to
ascertain
my
whereabouts
for
myself
,
whoever
*NL*
may
hinder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
not
,
then
,
believe
that
this
is
the
year
2000
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
it
necessary
to
ask
me
that
?
''
I
returned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
replied
my
extraordinary
host
.
``
Since
I
can
not
convince
*NL*
you
,
you
shall
convince
yourself
.
Are
you
strong
enough
to
follow
me
*NL*
upstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
as
strong
as
I
ever
was
,
''
I
replied
angrily
,
``
as
I
may
have
to
*NL*
prove
if
this
jest
is
carried
much
farther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
,
sir
,
''
was
my
companion
's
response
,
``
that
you
will
not
allow
*NL*
yourself
to
be
too
fully
persuaded
that
you
are
the
victim
of
a
trick
,
*NL*
lest
the
reaction
,
when
you
are
convinced
of
the
truth
of
my
*NL*
statements
,
should
be
too
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
of
concern
,
mingled
with
commiseration
,
with
which
he
said
*NL*
this
,
and
the
entire
absence
of
any
sign
of
resentment
at
my
hot
*NL*
words
,
strangely
daunted
me
,
and
I
followed
him
from
the
room
with
an
*NL*
extraordinary
mixture
of
emotions
.
He
led
the
way
up
two
flights
of
*NL*
stairs
and
then
up
a
shorter
one
,
which
landed
us
upon
a
belvedere
on
*NL*
the
house-top
.
``
Be
pleased
to
look
around
you
,
''
he
said
,
as
we
reached
*NL*
the
platform
,
``
and
tell
me
if
this
is
the
Boston
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
my
feet
lay
a
great
city
.
Miles
of
broad
streets
,
shaded
by
trees
*NL*
and
lined
with
fine
buildings
,
for
the
most
part
not
in
continuous
*NL*
blocks
but
set
in
larger
or
smaller
inclosures
,
stretched
in
every
*NL*
direction
.
Every
quarter
contained
large
open
squares
filled
with
*NL*
trees
,
among
which
statues
glistened
and
fountains
flashed
in
the
late
*NL*
afternoon
sun
.
Public
buildings
of
a
colossal
size
and
an
*NL*
architectural
grandeur
unparalleled
in
my
day
raised
their
stately
*NL*
piles
on
every
side
.
Surely
I
had
never
seen
this
city
nor
one
*NL*
comparable
to
it
before
.
Raising
my
eyes
at
last
towards
the
horizon
,
*NL*
I
looked
westward
.
That
blue
ribbon
winding
away
to
the
sunset
,
was
it
*NL*
not
the
sinuous
Charles
?
I
looked
east
;
Boston
harbor
stretched
before
*NL*
me
within
its
headlands
,
not
one
of
its
green
islets
missing
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
then
that
I
had
been
told
the
truth
concerning
the
prodigious
*NL*
thing
which
had
befallen
me
.

CHAPTER
IV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
faint
,
but
the
effort
to
realize
my
position
made
me
very
*NL*
giddy
,
and
I
remember
that
my
companion
had
to
give
me
a
strong
arm
as
*NL*
he
conducted
me
from
the
roof
to
a
roomy
apartment
on
the
upper
floor
*NL*
of
the
house
,
where
he
insisted
on
my
drinking
a
glass
or
two
of
good
*NL*
wine
and
partaking
of
a
light
repast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
are
going
to
be
all
right
now
,
''
he
said
cheerily
.
``
I
*NL*
should
not
have
taken
so
abrupt
a
means
to
convince
you
of
your
*NL*
position
if
your
course
,
while
perfectly
excusable
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
had
not
rather
obliged
me
to
do
so
.
I
confess
,
''
he
*NL*
added
laughing
,
``
I
was
a
little
apprehensive
at
one
time
that
I
should
*NL*
undergo
what
I
believe
you
used
to
call
a
knockdown
in
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
if
I
did
not
act
rather
promptly
.
I
remembered
that
the
*NL*
Bostonians
of
your
day
were
famous
pugilists
,
and
thought
best
to
lose
*NL*
no
time
.
I
take
it
you
are
now
ready
to
acquit
me
of
the
charge
of
*NL*
hoaxing
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
told
me
,
''
I
replied
,
profoundly
awed
,
``
that
a
thousand
*NL*
years
instead
of
a
hundred
had
elapsed
since
I
last
looked
on
this
*NL*
city

I
should
now
believe
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
century
has
passed

''
he
answered
,
``
but
many
a
millennium
in
*NL*
the
world
's
history
has
seen
changes
less
extraordinary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
he
added
,
extending
his
hand
with
an
air
of
irresistible
*NL*
cordiality
,
``
let
me
give
you
a
hearty
welcome
to
the
Boston
of
the
*NL*
twentieth
century
and
to
this
house

My
name
is
Leete

Dr.
Leete

*NL*
call
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

I
said
as
I
shook
his
hand
,
``
is
Julian
West

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
most
happy
in
making
your
acquaintance

''
he
responded
.
*NL*
``
Seeing
that
this
house
is
built
on
the
site
of
your
own
,
I
hope
you
*NL*
will
find
it
easy
to
make
yourself
at
home
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
my
refreshment
Dr.
Leete
offered
me
a
bath
and
a
change
of
*NL*
clothing
,
of
which
I
gladly
availed
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
did
not
appear
that
any
very
startling
revolution
in
men
's
attire
*NL*
had
been
among
the
great
changes
my
host
had
spoken
of
,
for
,
barring
a
*NL*
few
details
,
my
new
habiliments
did
not
puzzle
me
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Physically
,
I
was
now
myself
again
.
But
mentally
,
how
was
it
with
me
,
*NL*
the
reader
will
doubtless
wonder
.
What
were
my
intellectual
*NL*
sensations
,
he
may
wish
to
know
,
on
finding
myself
so
suddenly
dropped
*NL*
as
it
were
into
a
new
world
.
In
reply
let
me
ask
him
to
suppose
*NL*
himself
suddenly
,
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
transported
from
earth
,
*NL*
say
,
to
Paradise
or
Hades
.
What
does
he
fancy
would
be
his
own
*NL*
experience
?
Would
his
thoughts
return
at
once
to
the
earth
he
had
just
*NL*
left
,
or
would
he
,
after
the
first
shock
,
wellnigh
forget
his
former
*NL*
life
for
a
while
,
albeit
to
be
remembered
later
,
in
the
interest
*NL*
excited
by
his
new
surroundings
?
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
if
his
*NL*
experience
were
at
all
like
mine
in
the
transition
I
am
describing
,
*NL*
the
latter
hypothesis
would
prove
the
correct
one
.
The
impressions
of
*NL*
amazement
and
curiosity
which
my
new
surroundings
produced
occupied
my
*NL*
mind
,
after
the
first
shock
,
to
the
exclusion
of
all
other
thoughts
.
*NL*
For
the
time
the
memory
of
my
former
life
was
,
as
it
were
,
in
*NL*
abeyance
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
sooner
did
I
find
myself
physically
rehabilitated
through
the
kind
*NL*
offices
of
my
host
,
than
I
became
eager
to
return
to
the
house-top
;
*NL*
and
presently
we
were
comfortably
established
there
in
easy-chairs
,
*NL*
with
the
city
beneath
and
around
us
.
After
Dr.
Leete
had
responded
to
*NL*
numerous
questions
on
my
part
,
as
to
the
ancient
landmarks
I
missed
*NL*
and
the
new
ones
which
had
replaced
them
,
he
asked
me
what
point
of
*NL*
the
contrast
between
the
new
and
the
old
city
struck
me
most
forcibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
speak
of
small
things
before
great
,
''
I
responded
,
``
I
really
think
*NL*
that
the
complete
absence
of
chimneys
and
their
smoke
is
the
detail
*NL*
that
first
impressed
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
ejaculated
my
companion
with
an
air
of
much
interest
,
``
I
had
*NL*
forgotten
the
chimneys
,
it
is
so
long
since
they
went
out
of
use
.
It
*NL*
is
nearly
a
century
since
the
crude
method
of
combustion
on
which
you
*NL*
depended
for
heat
became
obsolete
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
general
,
''
I
said
,
``
what
impresses
me
most
about
the
city
is
the
*NL*
material
prosperity
on
the
part
of
the
people
which
its
magnificence
*NL*
implies
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
give
a
great
deal
for
just
one
glimpse
of
the
Boston
of
your
*NL*
day
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
No
doubt
,
as
you
imply
,
the
cities
of
that
*NL*
period
were
rather
shabby
affairs
.
If
you
had
the
taste
to
make
them
*NL*
splendid
,
which
I
would
not
be
so
rude
as
to
question
,
the
general
*NL*
poverty
resulting
from
your
extraordinary
industrial
system
would
not
*NL*
have
given
you
the
means
.
Moreover
,
the
excessive
individualism
which
*NL*
then
prevailed
was
inconsistent
with
much
public
spirit
.
What
little
*NL*
wealth
you
had
seems
almost
wholly
to
have
been
lavished
in
private
*NL*
luxury
.
Nowadays
,
on
the
contrary
,
there
is
no
destination
of
the
*NL*
surplus
wealth
so
popular
as
the
adornment
of
the
city
,
which
all
*NL*
enjoy
in
equal
degree
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
had
been
setting
as
we
returned
to
the
house-top
,
and
as
we
*NL*
talked
night
descended
upon
the
city
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
growing
dark
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
.
``
Let
us
descend
into
the
house
;
*NL*
I
want
to
introduce
my
wife
and
daughter
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
words
recalled
to
me
the
feminine
voices
which
I
had
heard
*NL*
whispering
about
me
as
I
was
coming
back
to
conscious
life
;
and
,
most
*NL*
curious
to
learn
what
the
ladies
of
the
year
2000
were
like
,
I
*NL*
assented
with
alacrity
to
the
proposition
.
The
apartment
in
which
we
*NL*
found
the
wife
and
daughter
of
my
host
,
as
well
as
the
entire
interior
*NL*
of
the
house
,
was
filled
with
a
mellow
light
,
which
I
knew
must
be
*NL*
artificial
,
although
I
could
not
discover
the
source
from
which
it
was
*NL*
diffused
.
Mrs.
Leete
was
an
exceptionally
fine
looking
and
well
*NL*
preserved
woman
of
about
her
husband
's
age
,
while
the
daughter
,
who
*NL*
was
in
the
first
blush
of
womanhood
,
was
the
most
beautiful
girl
I
had
*NL*
ever
seen
.
Her
face
was
as
bewitching
as
deep
blue
eyes
,
delicately
*NL*
tinted
complexion
,
and
perfect
features
could
make
it
,
but
even
had
*NL*
her
countenance
lacked
special
charms
,
the
faultless
luxuriance
of
her
*NL*
figure
would
have
given
her
place
as
a
beauty
among
the
women
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
.
Feminine
softness
and
delicacy
were
in
this
lovely
*NL*
creature
deliciously
combined
with
an
appearance
of
health
and
*NL*
abounding
physical
vitality
too
often
lacking
in
the
maidens
with
whom
*NL*
alone
I
could
compare
her
.
It
was
a
coincidence
trifling
in
comparison
*NL*
with
the
general
strangeness
of
the
situation
,
but
still
striking
,
*NL*
that
her
name
should
be
Edith
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
that
followed
was
certainly
unique
in
the
history
of
*NL*
social
intercourse
,
but
to
suppose
that
our
conversation
was
*NL*
peculiarly
strained
or
difficult
would
be
a
great
mistake
.
I
believe
*NL*
indeed
that
it
is
under
what
may
be
called
unnatural
,
in
the
sense
of
*NL*
extraordinary
,
circumstances
that
people
behave
most
naturally
,
for
*NL*
the
reason
,
no
doubt
,
that
such
circumstances
banish
artificiality
.
I
*NL*
know
at
any
rate
that
my
intercourse
that
evening
with
these
*NL*
representatives
of
another
age
and
world
was
marked
by
an
ingenuous
*NL*
sincerity
and
frankness
such
as
but
rarely
crown
long
acquaintance
.
No
*NL*
doubt
the
exquisite
tact
of
my
entertainers
had
much
to
do
with
this
.
*NL*
Of
course
there
was
nothing
we
could
talk
of
but
the
strange
*NL*
experience
by
virtue
of
which
I
was
there
,
but
they
talked
of
it
with
*NL*
an
interest
so
naive
and
direct
in
its
expression
as
to
relieve
the
*NL*
subject
to
a
great
degree
of
the
element
of
the
weird
and
the
uncanny
*NL*
which
might
so
easily
have
been
overpowering
.
One
would
have
supposed
*NL*
that
they
were
quite
in
the
habit
of
entertaining
waifs
from
another
*NL*
century
,
so
perfect
was
their
tact
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
my
own
part
,
never
do
I
remember
the
operations
of
my
mind
to
have
*NL*
been
more
alert
and
acute
than
that
evening
,
or
my
intellectual
*NL*
sensibilities
more
keen
.
Of
course
I
do
not
mean
that
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
my
amazing
situation
was
for
a
moment
out
of
mind
,
*NL*
but
its
chief
effect
thus
far
was
to
produce
a
feverish
elation
,
a
*NL*
sort
of
mental
intoxication
.

*NL*
*NL*
Edith
Leete
took
little
part
in
the
conversation
,
but
when
several
*NL*
times
the
magnetism
of
her
beauty
drew
my
glance
to
her
face
,
I
found
*NL*
her
eyes
fixed
on
me
with
an
absorbed
intensity
,
almost
like
*NL*
fascination
.
It
was
evident
that
I
had
excited
her
interest
to
an
*NL*
extraordinary
degree
,
as
was
not
astonishing
,
supposing
her
to
be
a
*NL*
girl
of
imagination
.
Though
I
supposed
curiosity
was
the
chief
motive
*NL*
of
her
interest
,
it
could
but
affect
me
as
it
would
not
have
done
had
*NL*
she
been
less
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
as
well
as
the
ladies
,
seemed
greatly
interested
in
my
*NL*
account
of
the
circumstances
under
which
I
had
gone
to
sleep
in
the
*NL*
underground
chamber
.
All
had
suggestions
to
offer
to
account
for
my
*NL*
having
been
forgotten
there
,
and
the
theory
which
we
finally
agreed
on
*NL*
offers
at
least
a
plausible
explanation
,
although
whether
it
be
in
its
*NL*
details
the
true
one
,
nobody
,
of
course
,
will
ever
know
.
The
layer
of
*NL*
ashes
found
above
the
chamber
indicated
that
the
house
had
been
burned
*NL*
down
.
Let
it
be
supposed
that
the
conflagration
had
taken
place
the
*NL*
night
I
fell
asleep
.
It
only
remains
to
assume
that
Sawyer
lost
his
*NL*
life
in
the
fire
or
by
some
accident
connected
with
it
,
and
the
rest
*NL*
follows
naturally
enough
.
No
one
but
he
and
Dr.
Pillsbury
either
knew
*NL*
of
the
existence
of
the
chamber
or
that
I
was
in
it
,
and
Dr.
*NL*
Pillsbury
,
who
had
gone
that
night
to
New
Orleans
,
had
probably
never
*NL*
heard
of
the
fire
at
all
.
The
conclusion
of
my
friends
,
and
of
the
*NL*
public
,
must
have
been
that
I
had
perished
in
the
flames
.
An
*NL*
excavation
of
the
ruins
,
unless
thorough
,
would
not
have
disclosed
the
*NL*
recess
in
the
foundation
walls
connecting
with
my
chamber
.
To
be
sure
,
*NL*
if
the
site
had
been
again
built
upon
,
at
least
immediately
,
such
an
*NL*
excavation
would
have
been
necessary
,
but
the
troublous
times
and
the
*NL*
undesirable
character
of
the
locality
might
well
have
prevented
*NL*
rebuilding
.
The
size
of
the
trees
in
the
garden
now
occupying
the
site
*NL*
indicated
,
Dr.
Leete
said
,
that
for
more
than
half
a
century
at
least
*NL*
it
had
been
open
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LSB-
Footnote

:
In
accounting
for
this
state
of
mind
it
must
be
*NL*
remembered
that
,
except
for
the
topic
of
our
conversations
,
there
was
*NL*
in
my
surroundings
next
to
nothing
to
suggest
what
had
befallen
me
.
*NL*
Within
a
block
of
my
home
in
the
old
Boston
I
could
have
found
social
*NL*
circles
vastly
more
foreign
to
me
.
The
speech
of
the
Bostonians
of
the
*NL*
twentieth
century
differs
even
less
from
that
of
their
cultured
*NL*
ancestors
of
the
nineteenth
than
did
that
of
the
latter
from
the
*NL*
language
of
Washington
and
Franklin
,
while
the
differences
between
the
*NL*
style
of
dress
and
furniture
of
the
two
epochs
are
not
more
marked
*NL*
than
I
have
known
fashion
to
make
in
the
time
of
one
generation

CHAPTER
V.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
ladies
retired
,
leaving
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
and
myself
alone
,
he
sounded
me
as
to
my
disposition
for
sleep
,
*NL*
saying
that
if
I
felt
like
it
my
bed
was
ready
for
me
;
but
if
I
was
*NL*
inclined
to
wakefulness
nothing
would
please
him
better
than
to
bear
*NL*
me
company
.
``
I
am
a
late
bird
,
myself
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
,
without
*NL*
suspicion
of
flattery
,
I
may
say
that
a
companion
more
interesting
*NL*
than
yourself
could
scarcely
be
imagined
.
It
is
decidedly
not
often
*NL*
that
one
has
a
chance
to
converse
with
a
man
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
I
had
been
looking
forward
all
the
evening
with
some
dread
to
the
*NL*
time
when
I
should
be
alone
,
on
retiring
for
the
night
.
Surrounded
by
*NL*
these
most
friendly
strangers
,
stimulated
and
supported
by
their
*NL*
sympathetic
interest
,
I
had
been
able
to
keep
my
mental
balance
.
Even
*NL*
then
,
however
,
in
pauses
of
the
conversation
I
had
had
glimpses
,
vivid
*NL*
as
lightning
flashes
,
of
the
horror
of
strangeness
that
was
waiting
to
*NL*
be
faced
when
I
could
no
longer
command
diversion
.
I
knew
I
could
not
*NL*
sleep
that
night
,
and
as
for
lying
awake
and
thinking
,
it
argues
no
*NL*
cowardice
,
I
am
sure
,
to
confess
that
I
was
afraid
of
it
.
When
,
in
*NL*
reply
to
my
host
's
question
,
I
frankly
told
him
this
,
he
replied
that
*NL*
it
would
be
strange
if
I
did
not
feel
just
so
,
but
that
I
need
have
no
*NL*
anxiety
about
sleeping
;
whenever
I
wanted
to
go
to
bed
,
he
would
give
*NL*
me
a
dose
which
would
insure
me
a
sound
night
's
sleep
without
fail
.
*NL*
Next
morning
,
no
doubt
,
I
would
awake
with
the
feeling
of
an
old
*NL*
citizen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
I
acquire
that
,
''
I
replied
,
``
I
must
know
a
little
more
about
*NL*
the
sort
of
Boston
I
have
come
back
to
.
You
told
me
when
we
were
upon
*NL*
the
house-top
that
though
a
century
only
had
elapsed
since
I
fell
*NL*
asleep
,
it
had
been
marked
by
greater
changes
in
the
conditions
of
*NL*
humanity
than
many
a
previous
millennium
.
With
the
city
before
me
I
*NL*
could
well
believe
that
,
but
I
am
very
curious
to
know
what
some
of
*NL*
the
changes
have
been
.
To
make
a
beginning
somewhere
,
for
the
subject
*NL*
is
doubtless
a
large
one
,
what
solution
,
if
any
,
have
you
found
for
*NL*
the
labor
question
?
It
was
the
Sphinx
's
riddle
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
and
when
I
dropped
out
the
Sphinx
was
threatening
to
devour
*NL*
society
,
because
the
answer
was
not
forthcoming
.
It
is
well
worth
*NL*
sleeping
a
hundred
years
to
learn
what
the
right
answer
was
,
if
,
*NL*
indeed
,
you
have
found
it
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
no
such
thing
as
the
labor
question
is
known
nowadays
,
''
replied
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
``
and
there
is
no
way
in
which
it
could
arise
,
I
suppose
we
*NL*
may
claim
to
have
solved
it
.
Society
would
indeed
have
fully
deserved
*NL*
being
devoured
if
it
had
failed
to
answer
a
riddle
so
entirely
simple
.
*NL*
In
fact
,
to
speak
by
the
book
,
it
was
not
necessary
for
society
to
*NL*
solve
the
riddle
at
all
.
It
may
be
said
to
have
solved
itself
.
The
*NL*
solution
came
as
the
result
of
a
process
of
industrial
evolution
which
*NL*
could
not
have
terminated
otherwise
.
All
that
society
had
to
do
was
to
*NL*
recognize
and
cooperate
with
that
evolution
,
when
its
tendency
had
*NL*
become
unmistakable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
only
say
,
''
I
answered
,
``
that
at
the
time
I
fell
asleep
no
such
*NL*
evolution
had
been
recognized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
in
1887
that
you
fell
into
this
sleep
,
I
think
you
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
May
30th
,
1887
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
companion
regarded
me
musingly
for
some
moments
.
Then
he
observed
,
*NL*
``
And
you
tell
me
that
even
then
there
was
no
general
recognition
of
*NL*
the
nature
of
the
crisis
which
society
was
nearing
?
Of
course
,
I
fully
*NL*
credit
your
statement
.
The
singular
blindness
of
your
contemporaries
*NL*
to
the
signs
of
the
times
is
a
phenomenon
commented
on
by
many
of
our
*NL*
historians
,
but
few
facts
of
history
are
more
difficult
for
us
to
*NL*
realize
,
so
obvious
and
unmistakable
as
we
look
back
seem
the
*NL*
indications
,
which
must
also
have
come
under
your
eyes
,
of
the
*NL*
transformation
about
to
come
to
pass
.
I
should
be
interested
,
Mr.
*NL*
West
,
if
you
would
give
me
a
little
more
definite
idea
of
the
view
*NL*
which
you
and
men
of
your
grade
of
intellect
took
of
the
state
and
*NL*
prospects
of
society
in
1887
.
You
must
,
at
least
,
have
realized
that
*NL*
the
widespread
industrial
and
social
troubles
,
and
the
underlying
*NL*
dissatisfaction
of
all
classes
with
the
inequalities
of
society
,
and
*NL*
the
general
misery
of
mankind
,
were
portents
of
great
changes
of
some
*NL*
sort
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
,
indeed
,
fully
realize
that
,
''
I
replied
.
``
We
felt
that
society
*NL*
was
dragging
anchor
and
in
danger
of
going
adrift
.
Whither
it
would
*NL*
drift
nobody
could
say
,
but
all
feared
the
rocks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nevertheless
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
the
set
of
the
current
was
perfectly
*NL*
perceptible
if
you
had
but
taken
pains
to
observe
it
,
and
it
was
not
*NL*
toward
the
rocks
,
but
toward
a
deeper
channel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
a
popular
proverb
,
''
I
replied
,
``
that
`
hindsight
is
better
than
*NL*
foresight
,
'
the
force
of
which
I
shall
now
,
no
doubt
,
appreciate
more
*NL*
fully
than
ever
.
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
the
prospect
was
such
when
I
*NL*
went
into
that
long
sleep
that
I
should
not
have
been
surprised
had
I
*NL*
looked
down
from
your
house-top
to-day
on
a
heap
of
charred
and
*NL*
moss-grown
ruins
instead
of
this
glorious
city
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
had
listened
to
me
with
close
attention
and
nodded
*NL*
thoughtfully
as
I
finished
speaking
.
``
What
you
have
said
,
''
he
*NL*
observed
,
``
will
be
regarded
as
a
most
valuable
vindication
of
Storiot
,
*NL*
whose
account
of
your
era
has
been
generally
thought
exaggerated
in
*NL*
its
picture
of
the
gloom
and
confusion
of
men
's
minds
.
That
a
period
*NL*
of
transition
like
that
should
be
full
of
excitement
and
agitation
was
*NL*
indeed
to
be
looked
for
;
but
seeing
how
plain
was
the
tendency
of
the
*NL*
forces
in
operation
,
it
was
natural
to
believe
that
hope
rather
than
*NL*
fear
would
have
been
the
prevailing
temper
of
the
popular
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
not
yet
told
me
what
was
the
answer
to
the
riddle
which
you
*NL*
found
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
am
impatient
to
know
by
what
contradiction
of
*NL*
natural
sequence
the
peace
and
prosperity
which
you
now
seem
to
enjoy
*NL*
could
have
been
the
outcome
of
an
era
like
my
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
''
replied
my
host
,
``
but
do
you
smoke
?
''
It
was
not
till
our
*NL*
cigars
were
lighted
and
drawing
well
that
he
resumed
.
``
Since
you
are
*NL*
in
the
humor
to
talk
rather
than
to
sleep
,
as
I
certainly
am
,
perhaps
*NL*
I
can
not
do
better
than
to
try
to
give
you
enough
idea
of
our
modern
*NL*
industrial
system
to
dissipate
at
least
the
impression
that
there
is
*NL*
any
mystery
about
the
process
of
its
evolution
.
The
Bostonians
of
your
*NL*
day
had
the
reputation
of
being
great
askers
of
questions
,
and
I
am
*NL*
going
to
show
my
descent
by
asking
you
one
to
begin
with
.
What
should
*NL*
you
name
as
the
most
prominent
feature
of
the
labor
troubles
of
your
*NL*
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
the
strikes
,
of
course
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
;
but
what
made
the
strikes
so
formidable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
great
labor
organizations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
was
the
motive
of
these
great
organizations
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
workmen
claimed
they
had
to
organize
to
get
their
rights
from
the
*NL*
big
corporations
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
just
it
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
;
``
the
organization
of
labor
and
the
*NL*
strikes
were
an
effect
,
merely
,
of
the
concentration
of
capital
in
*NL*
greater
masses
than
had
ever
been
known
before
.
Before
this
*NL*
concentration
began
,
while
as
yet
commerce
and
industry
were
conducted
*NL*
by
innumerable
petty
concerns
with
small
capital
,
instead
of
a
small
*NL*
number
of
great
concerns
with
vast
capital
,
the
individual
workman
was
*NL*
relatively
important
and
independent
in
his
relations
to
the
employer
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
when
a
little
capital
or
a
new
idea
was
enough
to
start
a
*NL*
man
in
business
for
himself
,
workingmen
were
constantly
becoming
*NL*
employers
and
there
was
no
hard
and
fast
line
between
the
two
classes
.
*NL*
Labor
unions
were
needless
then
,
and
general
strikes
out
of
the
*NL*
question
.
But
when
the
era
of
small
concerns
with
small
capital
was
*NL*
succeeded
by
that
of
the
great
aggregations
of
capital
,
all
this
was
*NL*
changed
.
The
individual
laborer
,
who
had
been
relatively
important
to
*NL*
the
small
employer
,
was
reduced
to
insignificance
and
powerlessness
*NL*
over
against
the
great
corporation
,
while
at
the
same
time
the
way
*NL*
upward
to
the
grade
of
employer
was
closed
to
him
.
Self-defense
drove
*NL*
him
to
union
with
his
fellows
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
records
of
the
period
show
that
the
outcry
against
the
*NL*
concentration
of
capital
was
furious
.
Men
believed
that
it
threatened
*NL*
society
with
a
form
of
tyranny
more
abhorrent
than
it
had
ever
*NL*
endured
.
They
believed
that
the
great
corporations
were
preparing
for
*NL*
them
the
yoke
of
a
baser
servitude
than
had
ever
been
imposed
on
the
*NL*
race
,
servitude
not
to
men
but
to
soulless
machines
incapable
of
any
*NL*
motive
but
insatiable
greed
.
Looking
back
,
we
can
not
wonder
at
their
*NL*
desperation
,
for
certainly
humanity
was
never
confronted
with
a
fate
*NL*
more
sordid
and
hideous
than
would
have
been
the
era
of
corporate
*NL*
tyranny
which
they
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Meanwhile
,
without
being
in
the
smallest
degree
checked
by
the
clamor
*NL*
against
it
,
the
absorption
of
business
by
ever
larger
monopolies
*NL*
continued
.
In
the
United
States
there
was
not
,
after
the
beginning
of
*NL*
the
last
quarter
of
the
century
,
any
opportunity
whatever
for
*NL*
individual
enterprise
in
any
important
field
of
industry
,
unless
*NL*
backed
by
a
great
capital
.
During
the
last
decade
of
the
century
,
such
*NL*
small
businesses
as
still
remained
were
fast-failing
survivals
of
a
*NL*
past
epoch
,
or
mere
parasites
on
the
great
corporations
,
or
else
*NL*
existed
in
fields
too
small
to
attract
the
great
capitalists
.
Small
*NL*
businesses
,
as
far
as
they
still
remained
,
were
reduced
to
the
*NL*
condition
of
rats
and
mice
,
living
in
holes
and
corners
,
and
counting
*NL*
on
evading
notice
for
the
enjoyment
of
existence
.
The
railroads
had
*NL*
gone
on
combining
till
a
few
great
syndicates
controlled
every
rail
in
*NL*
the
land
.
In
manufactories
,
every
important
staple
was
controlled
by
a
*NL*
syndicate
.
These
syndicates
,
pools
,
trusts
,
or
whatever
their
name
,
*NL*
fixed
prices
and
crushed
all
competition
except
when
combinations
as
*NL*
vast
as
themselves
arose
.
Then
a
struggle
,
resulting
in
a
still
*NL*
greater
consolidation
,
ensued
.
The
great
city
bazar
crushed
its
*NL*
country
rivals
with
branch
stores
,
and
in
the
city
itself
absorbed
its
*NL*
smaller
rivals
till
the
business
of
a
whole
quarter
was
concentrated
*NL*
under
one
roof
,
with
a
hundred
former
proprietors
of
shops
serving
as
*NL*
clerks
.
Having
no
business
of
his
own
to
put
his
money
in
,
the
small
*NL*
capitalist
,
at
the
same
time
that
he
took
service
under
the
*NL*
corporation
,
found
no
other
investment
for
his
money
but
its
stocks
*NL*
and
bonds
,
thus
becoming
doubly
dependent
upon
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
that
the
desperate
popular
opposition
to
the
consolidation
*NL*
of
business
in
a
few
powerful
hands
had
no
effect
to
check
it
proves
*NL*
that
there
must
have
been
a
strong
economical
reason
for
it
.
The
small
*NL*
capitalists
,
with
their
innumerable
petty
concerns
,
had
in
fact
*NL*
yielded
the
field
to
the
great
aggregations
of
capital
,
because
they
*NL*
belonged
to
a
day
of
small
things
and
were
totally
incompetent
to
the
*NL*
demands
of
an
age
of
steam
and
telegraphs
and
the
gigantic
scale
of
*NL*
its
enterprises
.
To
restore
the
former
order
of
things
,
even
if
*NL*
possible
,
would
have
involved
returning
to
the
day
of
stage-coaches
.
*NL*
Oppressive
and
intolerable
as
was
the
regime
of
the
great
*NL*
consolidations
of
capital
,
even
its
victims
,
while
they
cursed
it
,
*NL*
were
forced
to
admit
the
prodigious
increase
of
efficiency
which
had
*NL*
been
imparted
to
the
national
industries
,
the
vast
economies
effected
*NL*
by
concentration
of
management
and
unity
of
organization
,
and
to
*NL*
confess
that
since
the
new
system
had
taken
the
place
of
the
old
the
*NL*
wealth
of
the
world
had
increased
at
a
rate
before
undreamed
of
.
To
be
*NL*
sure
this
vast
increase
had
gone
chiefly
to
make
the
rich
richer
,
*NL*
increasing
the
gap
between
them
and
the
poor
;
but
the
fact
remained
*NL*
that
,
as
a
means
merely
of
producing
wealth
,
capital
had
been
proved
*NL*
efficient
in
proportion
to
its
consolidation
.
The
restoration
of
the
*NL*
old
system
with
the
subdivision
of
capital
,
if
it
were
possible
,
might
*NL*
indeed
bring
back
a
greater
equality
of
conditions
,
with
more
*NL*
individual
dignity
and
freedom
,
but
it
would
be
at
the
price
of
*NL*
general
poverty
and
the
arrest
of
material
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
there
,
then
,
no
way
of
commanding
the
services
of
the
mighty
*NL*
wealth-producing
principle
of
consolidated
capital
without
bowing
down
*NL*
to
a
plutocracy
like
that
of
Carthage
?
As
soon
as
men
began
to
ask
*NL*
themselves
these
questions
,
they
found
the
answer
ready
for
them
.
The
*NL*
movement
toward
the
conduct
of
business
by
larger
and
larger
*NL*
aggregations
of
capital
,
the
tendency
toward
monopolies
,
which
had
*NL*
been
so
desperately
and
vainly
resisted
,
was
recognized
at
last
,
in
*NL*
its
true
significance
,
as
a
process
which
only
needed
to
complete
its
*NL*
logical
evolution
to
open
a
golden
future
to
humanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Early
in
the
last
century
the
evolution
was
completed
by
the
final
*NL*
consolidation
of
the
entire
capital
of
the
nation
.
The
industry
and
*NL*
commerce
of
the
country
,
ceasing
to
be
conducted
by
a
set
of
*NL*
irresponsible
corporations
and
syndicates
of
private
persons
at
their
*NL*
caprice
and
for
their
profit
,
were
intrusted
to
a
single
syndicate
*NL*
representing
the
people
,
to
be
conducted
in
the
common
interest
for
*NL*
the
common
profit
.
The
nation
,
that
is
to
say
,
organized
as
the
one
*NL*
great
business
corporation
in
which
all
other
corporations
were
*NL*
absorbed
;
it
became
the
one
capitalist
in
the
place
of
all
other
*NL*
capitalists
,
the
sole
employer
,
the
final
monopoly
in
which
all
*NL*
previous
and
lesser
monopolies
were
swallowed
up
,
a
monopoly
in
the
*NL*
profits
and
economies
of
which
all
citizens
shared
.
The
epoch
of
*NL*
trusts
had
ended
in
The
Great
Trust
.
In
a
word
,
the
people
of
the
*NL*
United
States
concluded
to
assume
the
conduct
of
their
own
business
,
*NL*
just
as
one
hundred
odd
years
before
they
had
assumed
the
conduct
of
*NL*
their
own
government
,
organizing
now
for
industrial
purposes
on
*NL*
precisely
the
same
grounds
that
they
had
then
organized
for
political
*NL*
purposes
.
At
last
,
strangely
late
in
the
world
's
history
,
the
obvious
*NL*
fact
was
perceived
that
no
business
is
so
essentially
the
public
*NL*
business
as
the
industry
and
commerce
on
which
the
people
's
livelihood
*NL*
depends
,
and
that
to
entrust
it
to
private
persons
to
be
managed
for
*NL*
private
profit
is
a
folly
similar
in
kind
,
though
vastly
greater
in
*NL*
magnitude
,
to
that
of
surrendering
the
functions
of
political
*NL*
government
to
kings
and
nobles
to
be
conducted
for
their
personal
*NL*
glorification
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
stupendous
change
as
you
describe
,
''
said
I
,
``
did
not
,
of
*NL*
course
,
take
place
without
great
bloodshed
and
terrible
convulsions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
there
was
absolutely
no
*NL*
violence
.
The
change
had
been
long
foreseen
.
Public
opinion
had
become
*NL*
fully
ripe
for
it
,
and
the
whole
mass
of
the
people
was
behind
it
.
*NL*
There
was
no
more
possibility
of
opposing
it
by
force
than
by
*NL*
argument
.
On
the
other
hand
the
popular
sentiment
toward
the
great
*NL*
corporations
and
those
identified
with
them
had
ceased
to
be
one
of
*NL*
bitterness
,
as
they
came
to
realize
their
necessity
as
a
link
,
a
*NL*
transition
phase
,
in
the
evolution
of
the
true
industrial
system
.
The
*NL*
most
violent
foes
of
the
great
private
monopolies
were
now
forced
to
*NL*
recognize
how
invaluable
and
indispensable
had
been
their
office
in
*NL*
educating
the
people
up
to
the
point
of
assuming
control
of
their
own
*NL*
business
.
Fifty
years
before
,
the
consolidation
of
the
industries
of
*NL*
the
country
under
national
control
would
have
seemed
a
very
daring
*NL*
experiment
to
the
most
sanguine
.
But
by
a
series
of
object
lessons
,
*NL*
seen
and
studied
by
all
men
,
the
great
corporations
had
taught
the
*NL*
people
an
entirely
new
set
of
ideas
on
this
subject
.
They
had
seen
for
*NL*
many
years
syndicates
handling
revenues
greater
than
those
of
states
,
*NL*
and
directing
the
labors
of
hundreds
of
thousands
of
men
with
an
*NL*
efficiency
and
economy
unattainable
in
smaller
operations
.
It
had
come
*NL*
to
be
recognized
as
an
axiom
that
the
larger
the
business
the
simpler
*NL*
the
principles
that
can
be
applied
to
it
;
that
,
as
the
machine
is
*NL*
truer
than
the

so
the
system
,
which
in
a
great
concern
does
the
*NL*
work
of
the
master
's
eye
in
a
small
business
,
turns
out
more
accurate
*NL*
results
.
Thus
it
came
about
that
,
thanks
to
the
corporations
*NL*
themselves
,
when
it
was
proposed
that
the
nation
should
assume
their
*NL*
functions
,
the
suggestion
implied
nothing
which
seemed
impracticable
*NL*
even
to
the
timid
.
To
be
sure
it
was
a
step
beyond
any
yet
taken
,
a
*NL*
broader
generalization
,
but
the
very
fact
that
the
nation
would
be
the
*NL*
sole
corporation
in
the
field
would
,
it
was
seen
,
relieve
the
*NL*
undertaking
of
many
difficulties
with
which
the
partial
monopolies
had
*NL*
contended

*NL*
Dr.
Leete
ceased
speaking
,
and
I
remained
silent
,
endeavoring
to
form
*NL*
some
general
conception
of
the
changes
in
the
arrangements
of
society
*NL*
implied
in
the
tremendous
revolution
which
he
had
described
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
I
said
,
``
The
idea
of
such
an
extension
of
the
functions
of
*NL*
government
is
,
to
say
the
least
,
rather
overwhelming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Extension
!
''
he
repeated
,
``
where
is
the
extension
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
my
day
,
''
I
replied
,
``
it
was
considered
that
the
proper
functions
*NL*
of
government
,
strictly
speaking
,
were
limited
to
keeping
the
peace
*NL*
and
defending
the
people
against
the
public
enemy
,
that
is
,
to
the
*NL*
military
and
police
powers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
in
heaven
's
name
,
who
are
the
public
enemies
?
''
exclaimed
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
.
``
Are
they
France
,
England
,
Germany
,
or
hunger
,
cold
,
and
*NL*
nakedness
?
In
your
day
governments
were
accustomed
,
on
the
slightest
*NL*
international
misunderstanding
,
to
seize
upon
the
bodies
of
citizens
*NL*
and
deliver
them
over
by
hundreds
of
thousands
to
death
and
*NL*
mutilation
,
wasting
their
treasures
the
while
like
water
;
and
all
this
*NL*
oftenest
for
no
imaginable
profit
to
the
victims
.
We
have
no
wars
*NL*
now
,
and
our
governments
no
war
powers
,
but
in
order
to
protect
every
*NL*
citizen
against
hunger
,
cold
,
and
nakedness
,
and
provide
for
all
his
*NL*
physical
and
mental
needs
,
the
function
is
assumed
of
directing
his
*NL*
industry
for
a
term
of
years
.
No
,
Mr.
West
,
I
am
sure
on
reflection
*NL*
you
will
perceive
that
it
was
in
your
age
,
not
in
ours
,
that
the
*NL*
extension
of
the
functions
of
governments
was
extraordinary
.
Not
even
*NL*
for
the
best
ends
would
men
now
allow
their
governments
such
powers
as
*NL*
were
then
used
for
the
most
maleficent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leaving
comparisons
aside
,
''
I
said
,
``
the
demagoguery
and
corruption
*NL*
of
our
public
men
would
have
been
considered
,
in
my
day
,
insuperable
*NL*
objections
to
any
assumption
by
government
of
the
charge
of
the
*NL*
national
industries
.
We
should
have
thought
that
no
arrangement
could
*NL*
be
worse
than
to
entrust
the
politicians
with
control
of
the
*NL*
wealth-producing
machinery
of
the
country
.
Its
material
interests
were
*NL*
quite
too
much
the
football
of
parties
as
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
you
were
right
,
''
rejoined
Dr.
Leete
,
``
but
all
that
is
*NL*
changed
now
.
We
have
no
parties
or
politicians
,
and
as
for
demagoguery
*NL*
and
corruption
,
they
are
words
having
only
an
historical
*NL*
significance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Human
nature
itself
must
have
changed
very
much
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
,
''
was
Dr.
Leete
's
reply
,
``
but
the
conditions
of
human
*NL*
life
have
changed
,
and
with
them
the
motives
of
human
action
.
The
*NL*
organization
of
society
with
you
was
such
that
officials
were
under
a
*NL*
constant
temptation
to
misuse
their
power
for
the
private
profit
of
*NL*
themselves
or
others
.
Under
such
circumstances
it
seems
almost
strange
*NL*
that
you
dared
entrust
them
with
any
of
your
affairs
.
Nowadays
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary
,
society
is
so
constituted
that
there
is
absolutely
no
way
in
*NL*
which
an
official
,
however
ill-disposed
,
could
possibly
make
any
*NL*
profit
for
himself
or
any
one
else
by
a
misuse
of
his
power
.
Let
him
*NL*
be
as
bad
an
official
as
you
please
,
he
can
not
be
a
corrupt
one
.
There
*NL*
is
no
motive
to
be
.
The
social
system
no
longer
offers
a
premium
on
*NL*
dishonesty
.
But
these
are
matters
which
you
can
only
understand
as
you
*NL*
come
,
with
time
,
to
know
us
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
not
yet
told
me
how
you
have
settled
the
labor
problem
.
*NL*
It
is
the
problem
of
capital
which
we
have
been
discussing
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
``
After
the
nation
had
assumed
conduct
of
the
mills
,
machinery
,
*NL*
railroads
,
farms
,
mines
,
and
capital
in
general
of
the
country
,
the
*NL*
labor
question
still
remained
.
In
assuming
the
responsibilities
of
*NL*
capital
the
nation
had
assumed
the
difficulties
of
the
capitalist
's
*NL*
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
moment
the
nation
assumed
the
responsibilities
of
capital
those
*NL*
difficulties
vanished
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
The
national
organization
*NL*
of
labor
under
one
direction
was
the
complete
solution
of
what
was
,
*NL*
in
your
day
and
under
your
system
,
justly
regarded
as
the
insoluble
*NL*
labor
problem
.
When
the
nation
became
the
sole
employer
,
all
the
*NL*
citizens
,
by
virtue
of
their
citizenship
,
became
employees
,
to
be
*NL*
distributed
according
to
the
needs
of
industry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
,
''
I
suggested
,
``
you
have
simply
applied
the
principle
of
*NL*
universal
military
service
,
as
it
was
understood
in
our
day
,
to
the
*NL*
labor
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
that
was
something
which
followed
as
a
matter
*NL*
of
course
as
soon
as
the
nation
had
become
the
sole
capitalist
.
The
*NL*
people
were
already
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
the
obligation
of
*NL*
every
citizen
,
not
physically
disabled
,
to
contribute
his
military
*NL*
services
to
the
defense
of
the
nation
was
equal
and
absolute
.
That
it
*NL*
was
equally
the
duty
of
every
citizen
to
contribute
his
quota
of
*NL*
industrial
or
intellectual
services
to
the
maintenance
of
the
nation
*NL*
was
equally
evident
,
though
it
was
not
until
the
nation
became
the
*NL*
employer
of
labor
that
citizens
were
able
to
render
this
sort
of
*NL*
service
with
any
pretense
either
of
universality
or
equity
.
No
*NL*
organization
of
labor
was
possible
when
the
employing
power
was
*NL*
divided
among
hundreds
or
thousands
of
individuals
and
corporations
,
*NL*
between
which
concert
of
any
kind
was
neither
desired
,
nor
indeed
*NL*
feasible
.
It
constantly
happened
then
that
vast
numbers
who
desired
to
*NL*
labor
could
find
no
opportunity
,
and
on
the
other
hand
,
those
who
*NL*
desired
to
evade
a
part
or
all
of
their
debt
could
easily
do
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Service
,
now
,
I
suppose
,
is
compulsory
upon
all
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
rather
a
matter
of
course
than
of
compulsion
,
''
replied
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
.
``
It
is
regarded
as
so
absolutely
natural
and
reasonable
that
*NL*
the
idea
of
its
being
compulsory
has
ceased
to
be
thought
of
.
He
would
*NL*
be
thought
to
be
an
incredibly
contemptible
person
who
should
need
*NL*
compulsion
in
such
a
case
.
Nevertheless
,
to
speak
of
service
being
*NL*
compulsory
would
be
a
weak
way
to
state
its
absolute
inevitableness
.
*NL*
Our
entire
social
order
is
so
wholly
based
upon
and
deduced
from
it
*NL*
that
if
it
were
conceivable
that
a
man
could
escape
it
,
he
would
be
*NL*
left
with
no
possible
way
to
provide
for
his
existence

He
would
have
*NL*
excluded
himself
from

world

cut
himself
off
from
his
kind

in
a

word

committed
suicide

Oh
,
no
;
it
both
begins
later
and
ends
earlier
than
the
average
*NL*
working
period
in
your
day

Your
workshops
were
filled
with
children
*NL*
and
old
men
,
but
we
hold
the
period
of
youth
sacred
to
education

the
period

maturity

when
the
physical

equally
sacred

twenty-four

beginning
at

close

the

After
forty-five

while
discharged

the

still

The

CHAPTER
VII

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
after
you
have
mustered
your
industrial
army
into
service

''
I
*NL*
said
,
``
that
I
should
expect
the
chief
difficulty
to
arise
,
for
there
*NL*
its
analogy
with
a
military
army
must
cease
.
Soldiers
have
all
the
*NL*
same
thing
,
and
a
very
simple
thing
,
to
do
,
namely
,
to
practice
the
*NL*
manual
of
arms
,
to
march
and
stand
guard
.
But
the
industrial
army
must
*NL*
learn
and
follow
two
or
three
hundred
diverse
trades
and
avocations
.
*NL*
What
administrative
talent
can
be
equal
to
determining
wisely
what
*NL*
trade
or
business
every
individual
in
a
great
nation
shall
pursue
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
administration
has
nothing
to
do
with
determining
that
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
does
determine
it
,
then
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
man
for
himself
in
accordance
with
his
natural
aptitude
,
the
*NL*
utmost
pains
being
taken
to
enable
him
to
find
out
what
his
natural
*NL*
aptitude
really
is
.
The
principle
on
which
our
industrial
army
is
*NL*
organized
is
that
a
man
's
natural
endowments
,
mental
and
physical
,
*NL*
determine
what
he
can
work
at
most
profitably
to
the
nation
and
most
*NL*
satisfactorily
to
himself
.
While
the
obligation
of
service
in
some
*NL*
form
is
not
to
be
evaded
,
voluntary
election
,
subject
only
to
*NL*
necessary
regulation
,
is
depended
on
to
determine
the
particular
sort
*NL*
of
service
every
man
is
to
render
.
As
an
individual
's
satisfaction
*NL*
during
his
term
of
service
depends
on
his
having
an
occupation
to
his
*NL*
taste
,
parents
and
teachers
watch
from
early
years
for
indications
of
*NL*
special
aptitudes
in
children
.
A
thorough
study
of
the
National
*NL*
industrial
system
,
with
the
history
and
rudiments
of
all
the
great
*NL*
trades
,
is
an
essential
part
of
our
educational
system
.
While
manual
*NL*
training
is
not
allowed
to
encroach
on
the
general
intellectual
*NL*
culture
to
which
our
schools
are
devoted
,
it
is
carried
far
enough
to
*NL*
give
our
youth
,
in
addition
to
their
theoretical
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
national
industries
,
mechanical
and
agricultural
,
a
certain
*NL*
familiarity
with
their
tools
and
methods
.
Our
schools
are
constantly
*NL*
visiting
our
workshops
,
and
often
are
taken
on
long
excursions
to
*NL*
inspect
particular
industrial
enterprises
.
In
your
day
a
man
was
not
*NL*
ashamed
to
be
grossly
ignorant
of
all
trades
except
his
own
,
but
such
*NL*
ignorance
would
not
be
consistent
with
our
idea
of
placing
every
one
*NL*
in
a
position
to
select
intelligently
the
occupation
for
which
he
has
*NL*
most
taste
.
Usually
long
before
he
is
mustered
into
service
a
young
*NL*
man
has
found
out
the
pursuit
he
wants
to
follow
,
has
acquired
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
knowledge
about
it
,
and
is
waiting
impatiently
the
time
when
*NL*
he
can
enlist
in
its
ranks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
,
''
I
said
,
``
it
can
hardly
be
that
the
number
of
volunteers
for
*NL*
any
trade
is
exactly
the
number
needed
in
that
trade
.
It
must
be
*NL*
generally
either
under
or
over
the
demand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
supply
of
volunteers
is
always
expected
to
fully
equal
the
*NL*
demand
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
It
is
the
business
of
the
administration
*NL*
to
see
that
this
is
the
case
.
The
rate
of
volunteering
for
each
trade
*NL*
is
closely
watched
.
If
there
be
a
noticeably
greater
excess
of
*NL*
volunteers
over
men
needed
in
any
trade
,
it
is
inferred
that
the
trade
*NL*
offers
greater
attractions
than
others
.
On
the
other
hand
,
if
the
*NL*
number
of
volunteers
for
a
trade
tends
to
drop
below
the
demand
,
it
is
*NL*
inferred
that
it
is
thought
more
arduous
.
It
is
the
business
of
the
*NL*
administration
to
seek
constantly
to
equalize
the
attractions
of
the
*NL*
trades
,
so
far
as
the
conditions
of
labor
in
them
are
concerned
,
so
*NL*
that
all
trades
shall
be
equally
attractive
to
persons
having
natural
*NL*
tastes
for
them
.
This
is
done
by
making
the
hours
of
labor
in
*NL*
different
trades
to
differ
according
to
their
arduousness
.
The
lighter
*NL*
trades
,
prosecuted
under
the
most
agreeable
circumstances
,
have
in
*NL*
this
way
the
longest
hours
,
while
an
arduous
trade
,
such
as
mining
,
*NL*
has
very
short
hours
.
There
is
no
theory
,
no
_
a
priori
_
rule
,
by
which
*NL*
the
respective
attractiveness
of
industries
is
determined
.
The
*NL*
administration
,
in
taking
burdens
off
one
class
of
workers
and
adding
*NL*
them
to
other
classes
,
simply
follows
the
fluctuations
of
opinion
*NL*
among
the
workers
themselves
as
indicated
by
the
rate
of
*NL*
volunteering
.
The
principle
is
that
no
man
's
work
ought
to
be
,
on
the
*NL*
whole
,
harder
for
him
than
any
other
man
's
for
him
,
the
workers
*NL*
themselves
to
be
the
judges
.
There
are
no
limits
to
the
application
of
*NL*
this
rule
.
If
any
particular
occupation
is
in
itself
so
arduous
or
so
*NL*
oppressive
that
,
in
order
to
induce
volunteers
,
the
day
's
work
in
it
*NL*
had
to
be
reduced
to
ten
minutes
,
it
would
be
done
.
If
,
even
then
,
no
*NL*
man
was
willing
to
do
it
,
it
would
remain
undone
.
But
of
course
,
in
*NL*
point
of
fact
,
a
moderate
reduction
in
the
hours
of
labor
,
or
addition
*NL*
of
other
privileges
,
suffices
to
secure
all
needed
volunteers
for
any
*NL*
occupation
necessary
to
men
.
If
,
indeed
,
the
unavoidable
difficulties
*NL*
and
dangers
of
such
a
necessary
pursuit
were
so
great
that
no
*NL*
inducement
of
compensating
advantages
would
overcome
men
's
repugnance
*NL*
to
it
,
the
administration
would
only
need
to
take
it
out
of
the
common
*NL*
order
of
occupations
by
declaring
it
`
extra
hazardous
,
'
and
those
who
*NL*
pursued
it
especially
worthy
of
the
national
gratitude
,
to
be
overrun
*NL*
with
volunteers
.
Our
young
men
are
very
greedy
of
honor
,
and
do
not
*NL*
let
slip
such
opportunities
.
Of
course
you
will
see
that
dependence
on
*NL*
the
purely
voluntary
choice
of
avocations
involves
the
abolition
in
*NL*
all
of
anything
like
unhygienic
conditions
or
special
peril
to
life
*NL*
and
limb
.
Health
and
safety
are
conditions
common
to
all
industries
.
*NL*
The
nation
does
not
maim
and
slaughter
its
workmen
by
thousands
,
as
*NL*
did
the
private
capitalists
and
corporations
of
your
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
there
are
more
who
want
to
enter
a
particular
trade
than
there
*NL*
is
room
for
,
how
do
you
decide
between
the
applicants
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Preference
is
given
to
those
who
have
acquired
the
most
knowledge
of
*NL*
the
trade
they
wish
to
follow
.
No
man
,
however
,
who
through
successive
*NL*
years
remains
persistent
in
his
desire
to
show
what
he
can
do
at
any
*NL*
particular
trade
,
is
in
the
end
denied
an
opportunity
.
Meanwhile
,
if
a
*NL*
man
can
not
at
first
win
entrance
into
the
business
he
prefers
,
he
has
*NL*
usually
one
or
more
alternative
preferences
,
pursuits
for
which
he
has
*NL*
some
degree
of
aptitude
,
although
not
the
highest
.
Every
one
,
indeed
,
*NL*
is
expected
to
study
his
aptitudes
so
as
to
have
not
only
a
first
*NL*
choice
as
to
occupation
,
but
a
second
or
third
,
so
that
if
,
either
at
*NL*
the
outset
of
his
career
or
subsequently
,
owing
to
the
progress
of
*NL*
invention
or
changes
in
demand
,
he
is
unable
to
follow
his
first
*NL*
vocation
,
he
can
still
find
reasonably
congenial
employment
.
This
*NL*
principle
of
secondary
choices
as
to
occupation
is
quite
important
in
*NL*
our
system
.
I
should
add
,
in
reference
to
the
counter-possibility
of
*NL*
some
sudden
failure
of
volunteers
in
a
particular
trade
,
or
some
*NL*
sudden
necessity
of
an
increased
force
,
that
the
administration
,
while
*NL*
depending
on
the
voluntary
system
for
filling
up
the
trades
as
a
rule
,
*NL*
holds
always
in
reserve
the
power
to
call
for
special
volunteers
,
or
*NL*
draft
any
force
needed
from
any
quarter
.
Generally
,
however
,
all
needs
*NL*
of
this
sort
can
be
met
by
details
from
the
class
of
unskilled
or
*NL*
common
laborers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
this
class
of
common
laborers
recruited
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Surely
*NL*
nobody
voluntarily
enters
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
the
grade
to
which
all
new
recruits
belong
for
the
first
three
*NL*
years
of
their
service
.
It
is
not
till
after
this
period
,
during
which
*NL*
he
is
assignable
to
any
work
at
the
discretion
of
his
superiors
,
that
*NL*
the
young
man
is
allowed
to
elect
a
special
avocation
.
These
three
*NL*
years
of
stringent
discipline
none
are
exempt
from
,
and
very
glad
our
*NL*
young
men
are
to
pass
from
this
severe
school
into
the
comparative
*NL*
liberty
of
the
trades
.
If
a
man
were
so
stupid
as
to
have
no
choice
as
*NL*
to
occupation
,
he
would
simply
remain
a
common
laborer
;
but
such
*NL*
cases
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
are
not
common
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Having
once
elected
and
entered
on
a
trade
or
occupation
,
''
I
*NL*
remarked
,
``
I
suppose
he
has
to
stick
to
it
the
rest
of
his
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
necessarily
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
;
``
while
frequent
and
merely
*NL*
capricious
changes
of
occupation
are
not
encouraged
or
even
permitted
,
*NL*
every
worker
is
allowed
,
of
course
,
under
certain
regulations
and
in
*NL*
accordance
with
the
exigencies
of
the
service
,
to
volunteer
for
*NL*
another
industry
which
he
thinks
would
suit
him
better
than
his
first
*NL*
choice
.
In
this
case
his
application
is
received
just
as
if
he
were
*NL*
volunteering
for
the
first
time
,
and
on
the
same
terms
.
Not
only
*NL*
this
,
but
a
worker
may
likewise
,
under
suitable
regulations
and
not
*NL*
too
frequently
,
obtain
a
transfer
to
an
establishment
of
the
same
*NL*
industry
in
another
part
of
the
country
which
for
any
reason
he
may
*NL*
prefer
.
Under
your
system
a
discontented
man
could
indeed
leave
his
*NL*
work
at
will
,
but
he
left
his
means
of
support
at
the
same
time
,
and
*NL*
took
his
chances
as
to
future
livelihood
.
We
find
that
the
number
of
*NL*
men
who
wish
to
abandon
an
accustomed
occupation
for
a
new
one
,
and
*NL*
old
friends
and
associations
for
strange
ones
,
is
small
.
It
is
only
*NL*
the
poorer
sort
of
workmen
who
desire
to
change
even
as
frequently
as
*NL*
our
regulations
permit
.
Of
course
transfers
or
discharges
,
when
health
*NL*
demands
them
,
are
always
given
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
an
industrial
system
,
I
should
think
this
might
be
extremely
*NL*
efficient
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
I
do
n't
see
that
it
makes
any
provision
for
*NL*
the
professional
classes
,
the
men
who
serve
the
nation
with
brains
*NL*
instead
of
hands
.
Of
course
you
ca
n't
get
along
without
the
*NL*
brain-workers
.
How
,
then
,
are
they
selected
from
those
who
are
to
*NL*
serve
as
farmers
and
mechanics
?
That
must
require
a
very
delicate
sort
*NL*
of
sifting
process
,
I
should
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
does
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
;
``
the
most
delicate
possible
test
is
*NL*
needed
here
,
and
so
we
leave
the
question
whether
a
man
shall
be
a
*NL*
brain
or
hand
worker
entirely
to
him
to
settle
.
At
the
end
of
the
term
*NL*
of
three
years
as
a
common
laborer
,
which
every
man
must
serve
,
it
is
*NL*
for
him
to
choose
,
in
accordance
to
his
natural
tastes
,
whether
he
*NL*
will
fit
himself
for
an
art
or
profession
,
or
be
a
farmer
or
mechanic
.
*NL*
If
he
feels
that
he
can
do
better
work
with
his
brains
than
his
*NL*
muscles
,
he
finds
every
facility
provided
for
testing
the
reality
of
*NL*
his
supposed
bent
,
of
cultivating
it
,
and
if
fit
of
pursuing
it
as
his
*NL*
avocation
.
The
schools
of
technology
,
of
medicine
,
of
art
,
of
music
,
*NL*
of
histrionics
,
and
of
higher
liberal
learning
are
always
open
to
*NL*
aspirants
without
condition
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
not
the
schools
flooded
with
young
men
whose
only
motive
is
to
*NL*
avoid
work
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
smiled
a
little
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
is
at
all
likely
to
enter
the
professional
schools
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
avoiding
work
,
I
assure
you
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
are
intended
*NL*
for
those
with
special
aptitude
for
the
branches
they
teach
,
and
any
*NL*
one
without
it
would
find
it
easier
to
do
double
hours
at
his
trade
*NL*
than
try
to
keep
up
with
the
classes
.
Of
course
many
honestly
mistake
*NL*
their
vocation
,
and
,
finding
themselves
unequal
to
the
requirements
of
*NL*
the
schools
,
drop
out
and
return
to
the
industrial
service
;
no
*NL*
discredit
attaches
to
such
persons
,
for
the
public
policy
is
to
*NL*
encourage
all
to
develop
suspected
talents
which
only
actual
tests
can
*NL*
prove
the
reality
of
.
The
professional
and
scientific
schools
of
your
*NL*
day
depended
on
the
patronage
of
their
pupils
for
support
,
and
the
*NL*
practice
appears
to
have
been
common
of
giving
diplomas
to
unfit
*NL*
persons
,
who
afterwards
found
their
way
into
the
professions
.
Our
*NL*
schools
are
national
institutions
,
and
to
have
passed
their
tests
is
a
*NL*
proof
of
special
abilities
not
to
be
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
opportunity
for
a
professional
training
,
''
the
doctor
continued
,
*NL*
``
remains
open
to
every
man
till
the
age
of
thirty
is
reached
,
after
*NL*
which
students
are
not
received

as
there
would
remain
too
brief
a
*NL*
period
before
the
age
of
discharge
in
which
to
serve
the
nation
in
*NL*
their
professions
.
In
your
day
young
men
had
to
choose
their
*NL*
professions
very
young
,
and
therefore
,
in
a
large
proportion
of
*NL*
instances
,
wholly
mistook
their
vocations
.
It
is
recognized
nowadays
*NL*
that
the
natural
aptitudes
of
some
are
later
than
those
of
others
in
*NL*
developing
,
and
therefore
,
while
the
choice
of
profession
may
be
made
*NL*
as
early
as
twenty-four
,
it
remains
open
for
six
years
longer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
question
which
had
a
dozen
times
before
been
on
my
lips
now
found
*NL*
utterance
,
a
question
which
touched
upon
what
,
in
my
time
,
had
been
*NL*
regarded
the
most
vital
difficulty
in
the
way
of
any
final
settlement
*NL*
of
the
industrial
problem
.
``
It
is
an
extraordinary
thing
,
''
I
said
,
*NL*
``
that
you
should
not
yet
have
said
a
word
about
the
method
of
*NL*
adjusting
wages
.
Since
the
nation
is
the
sole
employer
,
the
government
*NL*
must
fix
the
rate
of
wages
and
determine
just
how
much
everybody
shall
*NL*
earn
,
from
the
doctors
to
the
diggers
.
All
I
can
say
is
,
that
this
*NL*
plan
would
never
have
worked
with
us
,
and
I
do
n't
see
how
it
can
now
*NL*
unless
human
nature
has
changed

In
my
day
,
nobody
was
satisfied
with
*NL*
his
wages
or
salary
.
Even
if
he
felt
he
received
enough
,
he
was
sure
*NL*
his
neighbor
had
too
much
,
which
was
as
bad
.
If
the
universal
*NL*
discontent
on
this
subject
,
instead
of
being
dissipated
in
curses
and
*NL*
strikes
directed
against
innumerable

could
have
been

concentrated
upon
one

that
the

the
strongest
ever

not

two
pay
days

*NL*
Dr.
Leete
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
very
true
,
''
he
said
,
``
a
general
strike
would
most
probably
*NL*
have
followed
the
first
pay
day

a
strike
directed

government
is
a
revolution

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

then
,
do
you
avoid
a
revolution
every
pay
day

I
demanded
.
``
Has
*NL*
some
prodigious
philosopher

he
did

gave
me
a

CHAPTER
VIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
I
awoke
I
felt
greatly
refreshed
,
and
lay
a
considerable
time
in
*NL*
a
dozing
state
,
enjoying
the
sensation
of
bodily
comfort
.
The
*NL*
experiences
of
the
day
previous
,
my
waking
to
find
myself
in
the
year
*NL*
2000
,
the
sight
of
the
new
Boston
,
my
host
and
his
family
,
and
the
*NL*
wonderful
things
I
had
heard
,
were
a
blank
in
my
memory
.
I
thought
I
*NL*
was
in
my
bed-chamber
at
home
,
and
the
half-dreaming
,
half-waking
*NL*
fancies
which
passed
before
my
mind
related
to
the
incidents
and
*NL*
experiences
of
my
former
life
.
Dreamily
I
reviewed
the
incidents
of
*NL*
Decoration
Day
,
my
trip
in
company
with
Edith
and
her
parents
to
Mount
*NL*
Auburn
,
and
my
dining
with
them
on
our
return
to
the
city
.
I
recalled
*NL*
how
extremely
well
Edith
had
looked
,
and
from
that
fell
to
thinking
of
*NL*
our
marriage
;
but
scarcely
had
my
imagination
begun
to
develop
this
*NL*
delightful
theme
than
my
waking
dream
was
cut
short
by
the
*NL*
recollection
of
the
letter
I
had
received
the
night
before
from
the
*NL*
builder
announcing
that
the
new
strikes
might
postpone
indefinitely
*NL*
the
completion
of
the
new
house
.
The
chagrin
which
this
recollection
*NL*
brought
with
it
effectually
roused
me
.
I
remembered
that
I
had
an
*NL*
appointment
with
the
builder
at
eleven
o'clock
,
to
discuss
the
strike
,
*NL*
and
opening
my
eyes
,
looked
up
at
the
clock
at
the
foot
of
my
bed
to
*NL*
see
what
time
it
was
.
But
no
clock
met
my
glance
,
and
what
was
more
,
I
*NL*
instantly
perceived
that
I
was
not
in
my
room
.
Starting
up
on
my
*NL*
couch
,
I
stared
wildly
round
the
strange
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
it
must
have
been
many
seconds
that
I
sat
up
thus
in
bed
*NL*
staring
about
,
without
being
able
to
regain
the
clew
to
my
personal
*NL*
identity
.
I
was
no
more
able
to
distinguish
myself
from
pure
being
*NL*
during
those
moments
than
we
may
suppose
a
soul
in
the
rough
to
be
*NL*
before
it
has
received
the
ear-marks
,
the
individualizing
touches
*NL*
which
make
it
a
person
.
Strange
that
the
sense
of
this
inability
*NL*
should
be
such
anguish
!
but
so
we
are
constituted
.
There
are
no
words
*NL*
for
the
mental
torture
I
endured
during
this
helpless
,
eyeless
groping
*NL*
for
myself
in
a
boundless
void
.
No
other
experience
of
the
mind
gives
*NL*
probably
anything
like
the
sense
of
absolute
intellectual
arrest
from
*NL*
the
loss
of
a
mental
fulcrum
,
a
starting
point
of
thought
,
which
comes
*NL*
during
such
a
momentary
obscuration
of
the
sense
of
one
's
identity
.
I
*NL*
trust
I
may
never
know
what
it
is
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
do
not
know
how
long
this
condition
had
lasted
,
--
it
seemed
an
*NL*
interminable
time
,
--
when
,
like
a
flash
,
the
recollection
of
everything
*NL*
came
back
to
me
.
I
remembered
who
and
where
I
was
,
and
how
I
had
come
*NL*
here
,
and
that
these
scenes
as
of
the
life
of
yesterday
which
had
*NL*
been
passing
before
my
mind
concerned
a
generation
long
,
long
ago
*NL*
mouldered
to
dust
.
Leaping
from
bed
,
I
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
*NL*
clasping
my
temples
with
all
my
might
between
my
hands
to
keep
them
*NL*
from
bursting
.
Then
I
fell
prone
on
the
couch
,
and
,
burying
my
face
in
*NL*
the
pillow
,
lay
with
out
motion
.
The
reaction
which
was
inevitable
,
*NL*
from
the
mental
elation
,
the
fever
of
the
intellect
that
had
been
the
*NL*
first
effect
of
my
tremendous
experience
,
had
arrived
.
The
emotional
*NL*
crisis
which
had
awaited
the
full
realization
of
my
actual
position
,
*NL*
and
all
that
it
implied
,
was
upon
me
,
and
with
set
teeth
and
laboring
*NL*
chest
,
gripping
the
bedstead
with
frenzied
strength
,
I
lay
there
and
*NL*
fought
for
my
sanity
.
In
my
mind
,
all
had
broken
loose
,
habits
of
*NL*
feeling
,
associations
of
thought
,
ideas
of
persons
and
things
,
all
had
*NL*
dissolved
and
lost
coherence
and
were
seething
together
in
apparently
*NL*
irretrievable
chaos
.
There
were
no
rallying
points
,
nothing
was
left
*NL*
stable
.
There
only
remained
the
will
,
and
was
any
human
will
strong
*NL*
enough
to
say
to
such
a
weltering
sea
``
Peace
,
be
still
''
?
I
dared
not
*NL*
think
.
Every
effort
to
reason
upon
what
had
befallen
me
,
and
realize
*NL*
what
it
implied
,
set
up
an
intolerable
swimming
of
the
brain
.
The
idea
*NL*
that
I
was
two
persons
,
that
my
identity
was
double
,
began
to
*NL*
fascinate
me
with
its
simple
solution
of
my
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
knew
that
I
was
on
the
verge
of
losing
my
mental
balance
.
If
I
lay
*NL*
there
thinking
,
I
was
doomed
.
Diversion
of
some
sort
I
must
have
,
at
*NL*
least
the
diversion
of
physical
exertion
.
I
sprang
up
,
and
,
hastily
*NL*
dressing
,
opened
the
door
of
my
room
and
went
down-stairs
.
The
hour
*NL*
was
very
early
,
it
being
not
yet
fairly
light
,
and
I
found
no
one
in
*NL*
the
lower
part
of
the
house
.
There
was
a
hat
in
the
hall
,
and
,
opening
*NL*
the
front
door
,
which
was
fastened
with
a
slightness
indicating
that
*NL*
burglary
was
not
among
the
perils
of
the
modern
Boston
,
I
found
myself
*NL*
on
the
street
.
For
two
hours
I
walked
or
ran
through
the
streets
of
*NL*
the
city
,
visiting
most
quarters
of
the
peninsular
part
of
the
town
.
*NL*
None
but
an
antiquarian
who
knows
something
of
the
contrast
which
the
*NL*
Boston
of
to-day
offers
to
the
Boston
of
the
nineteenth
century
can
*NL*
begin
to
appreciate
what
a
series
of
bewildering
surprises
I
underwent
*NL*
during
that
time
.
Viewed
from
the
house-top
the
day
before
,
the
city
*NL*
had
indeed
appeared
strange
to
me
,
but
that
was
only
in
its
general
*NL*
aspect
.
How
complete
the
change
had
been
I
first
realized
now
that
I
*NL*
walked
the
streets
.
The
few
old
landmarks
which
still
remained
only
*NL*
intensified
this
effect
,
for
without
them
I
might
have
imagined
myself
*NL*
in
a
foreign
town
.
A
man
may
leave
his
native
city
in
childhood
,
and
*NL*
return
fifty
years
later
,
perhaps
,
to
find
it
transformed
in
many
*NL*
features
.
He
is
astonished
,
but
he
is
not
bewildered
.
He
is
aware
of
a
*NL*
great
lapse
of
time
,
and
of
changes
likewise
occurring
in
himself
*NL*
meanwhile
.
He
but
dimly
recalls
the
city
as
he
knew
it
when
a
child
.
*NL*
But
remember
that
there
was
no
sense
of
any
lapse
of
time
with
me
.
So
*NL*
far
as
my
consciousness
was
concerned
,
it
was
but
yesterday
,
but
a
few
*NL*
hours
,
since
I
had
walked
these
streets
in
which
scarcely
a
feature
*NL*
had
escaped
a
complete
metamorphosis
.
The
mental
image
of
the
old
city
*NL*
was
so
fresh
and
strong
that
it
did
not
yield
to
the
impression
of
the
*NL*
actual
city
,
but
contended
with
it
,
so
that
it
was
first
one
and
then
*NL*
the
other
which
seemed
the
more
unreal
.
There
was
nothing
I
saw
which
*NL*
was
not
blurred
in
this
way
,
like
the
faces
of
a
composite
photograph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
I
stood
again
at
the
door
of
the
house
from
which
I
had
come
*NL*
out
.
My
feet
must
have
instinctively
brought
me
back
to
the
site
of
my
*NL*
old
home
,
for
I
had
no
clear
idea
of
returning
thither
.
It
was
no
more
*NL*
homelike
to
me
than
any
other
spot
in
this
city
of
a
strange
*NL*
generation
,
nor
were
its
inmates
less
utterly
and
necessarily
*NL*
strangers
than
all
the
other
men
and
women
now
on
the
earth
.
Had
the
*NL*
door
of
the
house
been
locked
,
I
should
have
been
reminded
by
its
*NL*
resistance
that
I
had
no
object
in
entering
,
and
turned
away
,
but
it
*NL*
yielded
to
my
hand
,
and
advancing
with
uncertain
steps
through
the
*NL*
hall
,
I
entered
one
of
the
apartments
opening
from
it
.
Throwing
myself
*NL*
into
a
chair
,
I
covered
my
burning
eyeballs
with
my
hands
to
shut
out
*NL*
the
horror
of
strangeness
.
My
mental
confusion
was
so
intense
as
to
*NL*
produce
actual
nausea
.
The
anguish
of
those
moments
,
during
which
my
*NL*
brain
seemed
melting
,
or
the
abjectness
of
my
sense
of
helplessness
,
*NL*
how
can
I
describe
?
In
my
despair
I
groaned
aloud
.
I
began
to
feel
*NL*
that
unless
some
help
should
come
I
was
about
to
lose
my
mind
.
And
*NL*
just
then
it
did
come
.
I
heard
the
rustle
of
drapery
,
and
looked
up
.
*NL*
Edith
Leete
was
standing
before
me
.
Her
beautiful
face
was
full
of
the
*NL*
most
poignant
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
is
the
matter
,
Mr.
West
?
''
she
said
.
``
I
was
here
when
you
*NL*
came
in
.
I
saw
how
dreadfully
distressed
you
looked
,
and
when
I
heard
*NL*
you
groan
,
I
could
not
keep
silent
.
What
has
happened
to
you
?
Where
*NL*
have
you
been
?
Ca
n't
I
do
something
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
she
involuntarily
held
out
her
hands
in
a
gesture
of
*NL*
compassion
as
she
spoke
.
At
any
rate
I
had
caught
them
in
my
own
and
*NL*
was
clinging
to
them
with
an
impulse
as
instinctive
as
that
which
*NL*
prompts
the
drowning
man
to
seize
upon
and
cling
to
the
rope
which
is
*NL*
thrown
him
as
he
sinks
for
the
last
time
.
As
I
looked
up
into
her
*NL*
compassionate
face
and
her
eyes
moist
with
pity
,
my
brain
ceased
to
*NL*
whirl
.
The
tender
human
sympathy
which
thrilled
in
the
soft
pressure
*NL*
of
her
fingers
had
brought
me
the
support
I
needed
.
Its
effect
to
calm
*NL*
and
soothe
was
like
that
of
some
wonder-working
elixir
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
you
,
''
I
said
,
after
a
few
moments
.
``
He
must
have
sent
you
*NL*
to
me
just
now
.
I
think
I
was
in
danger
of
going
crazy
if
you
had
not
*NL*
come
.
''
At
this
the
tears
came
into
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
West
!
''
she
cried
.
``
How
heartless
you
must
have
thought
us
!
*NL*
How
could
we
leave
you
to
yourself
so
long
!
But
it
is
over
now
,
is
it
*NL*
not
?
You
are
better
,
surely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
thanks
to
you
.
If
you
will
not
go
away
quite
yet
,
I
*NL*
shall
be
myself
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
will
not
go
away
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
little
quiver
of
her
*NL*
face
,
more
expressive
of
her
sympathy
than
a
volume
of
words
.
``
You
*NL*
must
not
think
us
so
heartless
as
we
seemed
in
leaving
you
so
by
*NL*
yourself
.
I
scarcely
slept
last
night
,
for
thinking
how
strange
your
*NL*
waking
would
be
this
morning
;
but
father
said
you
would
sleep
till
*NL*
late
.
He
said
that
it
would
be
better
not
to
show
too
much
sympathy
*NL*
with
you
at
first
,
but
to
try
to
divert
your
thoughts
and
make
you
*NL*
feel
that
you
were
among
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
indeed
made
me
feel
that
,
''
I
answered
.
``
But
you
see
it
is
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
a
jolt
to
drop
a
hundred
years
,
and
although
I
did
not
*NL*
seem
to
feel
it
so
much
last
night
,
I
have
had
very
odd
sensations
*NL*
this
morning
.
''
While
I
held
her
hands
and
kept
my
eyes
on
her
face
,
I
*NL*
could
already
even
jest
a
little
at
my
plight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
thought
of
such
a
thing
as
your
going
out
in
the
city
alone
so
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
Oh
,
Mr.
West
,
where
have
you
*NL*
been
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
I
told
her
of
my
morning
's
experience
,
from
my
first
waking
till
*NL*
the
moment
I
had
looked
up
to
see
her
before
me
,
just
as
I
have
told
*NL*
it
here
.
She
was
overcome
by
distressful
pity
during
the
recital
,
and
,
*NL*
though
I
had
released
one
of
her
hands
,
did
not
try
to
take
from
me
*NL*
the
other
,
seeing
,
no
doubt
,
how
much
good
it
did
me
to
hold
it
.
``
I
*NL*
can
think
a
little
what
this
feeling
must
been
like
,
''
she
said
.
``
It
*NL*
must
have
been
terrible
.
And
to
think
you
were
left
alone
to
struggle
*NL*
with
it
!
Can
you
ever
forgive
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
gone
now
.
You
have
driven
it
quite
away
for
the
present
,
''
I
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
not
let
it
return
again
,
''
she
queried
anxiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
quite
say
that
,
''
I
replied
.
``
It
might
be
too
early
to
say
*NL*
that
,
considering
how
strange
everything
will
still
be
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
not
try
to
contend
with
it
alone
again
,
at
least
,
''
she
*NL*
persisted
.
``
Promise
that
you
will
come
to
us
,
and
let
us
sympathize
*NL*
with
you
,
and
try
to
help
you
.
Perhaps
we
ca
n't
do
much
,
but
it
will
*NL*
surely
be
better
than
to
try
to
bear
such
feelings
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
come
to
you
if
you
will
let
me
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
yes
,
I
beg
you
will
,
''
she
said
eagerly
.
``
I
would
do
anything
*NL*
to
help
you
that
I
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
you
need
do
is
to
be
sorry
for
me
,
as
you
seem
to
be
now
,
''
I
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
understood
,
then
,
''
she
said
,
smiling
with
wet
eyes
,
``
that
you
*NL*
are
to
come
and
tell
me
next
time
,
and
not
run
all
over
Boston
among
*NL*
strangers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
assumption
that
we
were
not
strangers
seemed
scarcely
strange
,
so
*NL*
near
within
these
few
minutes
had
my
trouble
and
her
sympathetic
tears
*NL*
brought
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
promise
,
when
you
come
to
me
,
''
she
added
,
with
an
expression
*NL*
of
charming
archness
,
passing
,
as
she
continued
,
into
one
of
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
``
to
seem
as
sorry
for
you
as
you
wish
,
but
you
must
not
*NL*
for
a
moment
suppose
that
I
am
really
sorry
for
you
at
all
,
or
that
I
*NL*
think
you
will
long
be
sorry
for
yourself
.
I
know
,
as
well
as
I
know
*NL*
that
the
world
now
is
heaven
compared
with
what
it
was
in
your
day
,
*NL*
that
the
only
feeling
you
will
have
after
a
little
while
will
be
one
*NL*
of
thankfulness
to
God
that
your
life
in
that
age
was
so
strangely
cut
*NL*
off
,
to
be
returned
to
you
in
this

CHAPTER
IX
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Leete
were
evidently
not
a
little
startled
to
learn
,
when
*NL*
they
presently
appeared
,
that
I
had
been
all
over
the
city
alone
that
*NL*
morning
,
and
it
was
apparent
that
they
were
agreeably
surprised
to
see
*NL*
that
I
seemed
so
little
agitated
after
the
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
stroll
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
be
a
very
interesting
one
,
''
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Leete
,
as
we
sat
down
to
table
soon
after
.
``
You
must
have
*NL*
seen
a
good
many
new
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
very
little
that
was
not
new

''
I
replied
.
``
But
I
think
what
*NL*
surprised
me
as
much
as
anything
was
not
to
find
any
stores
on
*NL*
Washington
Street
,
or
any
banks
on
State
.
What
have
you
done
with
the
*NL*
merchants
and
bankers
?
Hung
them
all
,
perhaps
,
as
the
anarchists
*NL*
wanted
to
do
in
my
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
so
bad
as
that
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
We
have
simply
dispensed
*NL*
with
them
.
Their
functions
are
obsolete
in
the
modern
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
sells
you
things
when
you
want
to
buy
them
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
neither
selling
nor
buying
nowadays
;
the
distribution
of
*NL*
goods
is
effected
in
another
way
.
As
to
the
bankers
,
having
no
money
*NL*
we
have
no
use
for
those
gentry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Leete
,
''
said
I
,
turning
to
Edith
,
``
I
am
afraid
that
your
father
*NL*
is
making
sport
of
me
.
I
do
n't
blame
him
,
for
the
temptation
my
*NL*
innocence
offers
must
be
extraordinary
.
But
,
really
,
there
are
limits
*NL*
to
my
credulity
as
to
possible
alterations
in
the
social
system
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
has
no
idea
of
jesting
,
I
am
sure

''
she
replied
,
with
a
*NL*
reassuring
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conversation
took
another
turn
then
,
the
point
of
ladies
'
fashions
*NL*
in
the
nineteenth
century
being
raised
,
if
I
remember
rightly
,
by
Mrs.
*NL*
Leete
,
and
it
was
not
till
after
breakfast
,
when
the
doctor
had
*NL*
invited
me
up
to
the
house-top
,
which
appeared
to
be
a
favorite
resort
*NL*
of
his
,
that
he
recurred
to
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
surprised
,
''
he
said
,
``
at
my
saying
that
we
got
along
without
*NL*
money
or
trade
,
but
a
moment
's
reflection
will
show
that
trade
existed
*NL*
and
money
was
needed
in
your
day
simply
because
the
business
of
*NL*
production
was
left
in
private
hands
,
and
that
,
consequently
,
they
are
*NL*
superfluous
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
at
once
see
how
that
follows
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
very
simple
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
.
``
When
innumerable
different
and
*NL*
independent
persons
produced
the
various
things
needful
to
life
and
*NL*
comfort
,
endless
exchanges
between
individuals
were
requisite
in
*NL*
order
that
they
might
supply
themselves
with
what
they
desired
.
These
*NL*
exchanges
constituted
trade
,
and
money
was
essential
as
their
medium
.
*NL*
But
as
soon
as
the
nation
became
the
sole
producer
of
all
sorts
of
*NL*
commodities
,
there
was
no
need
of
exchanges
between
individuals
that
*NL*
they
might
get
what
they
required
.
Everything
was
procurable
from
one
*NL*
source
,
and
nothing
could
be
procured
anywhere
else
.
A
system
of
*NL*
direct
distribution
from
the
national
storehouses
took
the
place
of
*NL*
trade
,
and
for
this
money
was
unnecessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
this
distribution
managed
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
simplest
possible
plan
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
A
credit
*NL*
corresponding
to
his
share
of
the
annual
product
of
the
nation
is
*NL*
given
to
every
citizen
on
the
public
books
at
the
beginning
of
each
*NL*
year
,
and
a
credit
card
issued
him
with
which
he
procures
at
the
*NL*
public
storehouses
,
found
in
every
community
,
whatever
he
desires
*NL*
whenever
he
desires
it
.
This
arrangement
,
you
will
see
,
totally
*NL*
obviates
the
necessity
for
business
transactions
of
any
sort
between
*NL*
individuals
and
consumers
.
Perhaps
you
would
like
to
see
what
our
*NL*
credit-cards
are
like
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
observe
,
''
he
pursued
as
I
was
curiously
examining
the
piece
of
*NL*
pasteboard
he
gave
me
,
``
that
this
card
is
issued
for
a
certain
number
*NL*
of
dollars
.
We
have
kept
the
old
word
,
but
not
the
substance
.
The
*NL*
term
,
as
we
use
it
,
answers
to
no
real
thing
,
but
merely
serves
as
an
*NL*
algebraical
symbol
for
comparing
the
values
of
products
with
one
*NL*
another
.
For
this
purpose
they
are
all
priced
in
dollars
and
cents
,
*NL*
just
as
in
your
day
.
The
value
of
what
I
procure
on
this
card
is
*NL*
checked
off
by
the
clerk
,
who
pricks
out
of
these
tiers
of
squares
the
*NL*
price
of
what
I
order
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
wanted
to
buy
something
of
your
neighbor
,
could
you
transfer
*NL*
part
of
your
credit
to
him
as
consideration
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
our
neighbors
have
nothing
*NL*
to
sell
us
,
but
in
any
event
our
credit
would
not
be
transferable
,
*NL*
being
strictly
personal
.
Before
the
nation
could
even
think
of
*NL*
honoring
any
such
transfer
as
you
speak
of
,
it
would
be
bound
to
*NL*
inquire
into
all
the
circumstances
of
the
transaction
,
so
as
to
be
*NL*
able
to
guarantee
its
absolute
equity
.
It
would
have
been
reason
*NL*
enough
,
had
there
been
no
other
,
for
abolishing
money
,
that
its
*NL*
possession
was
no
indication
of
rightful
title
to
it
.
In
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
man
who
had
stolen
it
or
murdered
for
it
,
it
was
as
good
as
in
*NL*
those
which
had
earned
it
by
industry
.
People
nowadays
interchange
*NL*
gifts
and
favors
out
of
friendship
,
but
buying
and
selling
is
*NL*
considered
absolutely
inconsistent
with
the
mutual
benevolence
and
*NL*
disinterestedness
which
should
prevail
between
citizens
and
the
sense
*NL*
of
community
of
interest
which
supports
our
social
system
.
According
*NL*
to
our
ideas
,
buying
and
selling
is
essentially
anti-social
in
all
*NL*
its
tendencies
.
It
is
an
education
in
self-seeking
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
others
,
and
no
society
whose
citizens
are
trained
in
such
a
school
can
*NL*
possibly
rise
above
a
very
low
grade
of
civilization
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
you
have
to
spend
more
than
your
card
in
any
one
year
?
''
I
*NL*
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
provision
is
so
ample
that
we
are
more
likely
not
to
spend
it
*NL*
all
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
But
if
extraordinary
expenses
should
exhaust
*NL*
it
,
we
can
obtain
a
limited
advance
on
the
next
year
's
credit
,
though
*NL*
this
practice
is
not
encouraged
,
and
a
heavy
discount
is
charged
to
*NL*
check
it
.
Of
course
if
a
man
showed
himself
a
reckless
spendthrift
he
*NL*
would
receive
his
allowance
monthly
or
weekly
instead
of
yearly
,
or
if
*NL*
necessary
not
be
permitted
to
handle
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
do
n't
spend
your
allowance
,
I
suppose
it
accumulates
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
also
permitted
to
a
certain
extent
when
a
special
outlay
is
*NL*
anticipated
.
But
unless
notice
to
the
contrary
is
given
,
it
is
*NL*
presumed
that
the
citizen
who
does
not
fully
expend
his
credit
did
not
*NL*
have
occasion
to
do
so
,
and
the
balance
is
turned
into
the
general
*NL*
surplus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
system
does
not
encourage
saving
habits
on
the
part
of
*NL*
citizens
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
intended
to
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
The
nation
is
rich
,
and
does
*NL*
not
wish
the
people
to
deprive
themselves
of
any
good
thing
.
In
your
*NL*
day
,
men
were
bound
to
lay
up
goods
and
money
against
coming
failure
*NL*
of
the
means
of
support
and
for
their
children
.
This
necessity
made
*NL*
parsimony
a
virtue
.
But
now
it
would
have
no
such
laudable
object
,
*NL*
and
,
having
lost
its
utility
,
it
has
ceased
to
be
regarded
as
a
*NL*
virtue
.
No
man
any
more
has
any
care
for
the
morrow
,
either
for
*NL*
himself
or
his
children
,
for
the
nation
guarantees
the
nurture
,
*NL*
education
,
and
comfortable
maintenance
of
every
citizen
from
the
*NL*
cradle
to
the
grave
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
sweeping
guarantee
!
''
I
said
.
``
What
certainty
can
there
be
*NL*
that
the
value
of
a
man
's
labor
will
recompense
the
nation
for
its
*NL*
outlay
on
him
?
On
the
whole
,
society
may
be
able
to
support
all
its
*NL*
members
,
but
some
must
earn
less
than
enough
for
their
support
,
and
*NL*
others
more
;
and
that
brings
us
back
once
more
to
the
wages
question
,
*NL*
on
which
you
have
hitherto
said
nothing
.
It
was
at
just
this
point
,
if
*NL*
you
remember
,
that
our
talk
ended
last
evening
;
and
I
say
again
,
as
I
*NL*
did
then
,
that
here
I
should
suppose
a
national
industrial
system
like
*NL*
yours
would
find
its
main
difficulty
.
How
,
I
ask
once
more
,
can
you
*NL*
adjust
satisfactorily
the
comparative
wages
or
remuneration
of
the
*NL*
multitude
of
avocations
,
so
unlike
and
so
incommensurable
,
which
are
*NL*
necessary
for
the
service
of
society
?
In
our
day
the
market
rate
*NL*
determined
the
price
of
labor
of
all
sorts
,
as
well
as
of
goods
.
The
*NL*
employer
paid
as
little
as
he
could
,
and
the
worker
got
as
much
.
It
*NL*
was
not
a
pretty
system
ethically
,
I
admit
;
but
it
did
,
at
least
,
*NL*
furnish
us
a
rough
and
ready
formula
for
settling
a
question
which
*NL*
must
be
settled
ten
thousand
times
a
day
if
the
world
was
ever
going
*NL*
to
get
forward
.
There
seemed
to
us
no
other
practicable
way
of
doing
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
it
was
the
only
practicable
way
under
a
*NL*
system
which
made
the
interests
of
every
individual
antagonistic
to
*NL*
those
of
every
other
;
but
it
would
have
been
a
pity
if
humanity
could
*NL*
never
have
devised
a
better
plan
,
for
yours
was
simply
the
application
*NL*
to
the
mutual
relations
of
men
of
the
devil
's
maxim
,
`
Your
necessity
*NL*
is
my
opportunity
.
'
The
reward
of
any
service
depended
not
upon
its
*NL*
difficulty
,
danger
,
or
hardship
,
for
throughout
the
world
it
seems
*NL*
that
the
most
perilous
,
severe
,
and
repulsive
labor
was
done
by
the
*NL*
worst
paid
classes
;
but
solely
upon
the
strait
of
those
who
needed
the
*NL*
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
that
is
conceded
,
''
I
said
.
``
But
,
with
all
its
defects
,
the
plan
*NL*
of
settling
prices
by
the
market
rate
was
a
practical
plan
;
and
I
*NL*
can
not
conceive
what
satisfactory
substitute
you
can
have
devised
for
*NL*
it
.
The
government
being
the
only
possible
employer
,
there
is
of
*NL*
course
no
labor
market
or
market
rate
.
Wages
of
all
sorts
must
be
*NL*
arbitrarily
fixed
by
the
government
.
I
can
not
imagine
a
more
complex
*NL*
and
delicate
function
than
that
must
be
,
or
one
,
however
performed
,
*NL*
more
certain
to
breed
universal
dissatisfaction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
but
I
think
you
exaggerate
*NL*
the
difficulty
.
Suppose
a
board
of
fairly
sensible
men
were
charged
*NL*
with
settling
the
wages
for
all
sorts
of
trades
under
a
system
which
,
*NL*
like
ours
,
guaranteed
employment
to
all
,
while
permitting
the
choice
*NL*
of
avocations
.
Do
n't
you
see
that
,
however
unsatisfactory
the
first
*NL*
adjustment
might
be
,
the
mistakes
would
soon
correct
themselves
?
The
*NL*
favored
trades
would
have
too
many
volunteers
,
and
those
discriminated
*NL*
against
would
lack
them
till
the
errors
were
set
right
.
But
this
is
*NL*
aside
from
the
purpose
,
for
,
though
this
plan
would
,
I
fancy
,
be
*NL*
practicable
enough
,
it
is
no
part
of
our
system
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
,
then
,
do
you
regulate
wages
?
''
I
once
more
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
did
not
reply
till
after
several
moments
of
meditative
*NL*
silence
.
``
I
know
,
of
course
,
''
he
finally
said
,
``
enough
of
the
old
*NL*
order
of
things
to
understand
just
what
you
mean
by
that
question
;
and
*NL*
yet
the
present
order
is
so
utterly
different
at
this
point
that
I
am
*NL*
a
little
at
loss
how
to
answer
you
best
.
You
ask
me
how
we
regulate
*NL*
wages
;
I
can
only
reply
that
there
is
no
idea
in
the
modern
social
*NL*
economy
which
at
all
corresponds
with
what
was
meant
by
wages
in
your
*NL*
day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
mean
that
you
have
no
money
to
pay
wages
in
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
``
But
the
credit
given
the
worker
at
the
government
storehouse
answers
*NL*
to
his
wages
with
us

How
is
the
amount
of
the
credit
given
*NL*
respectively
to
the
workers
in
different
lines
determined
?
By
what
*NL*
title
does
the
individual
claim
his
particular
share
?
What
is
the
*NL*
basis
of
allotment
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
title
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
is
his
humanity
.
The
basis
of
his
*NL*
claim
is
the
fact
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

I
repeated
,
incredulously

The
readers
of
this
book
never
having
practically
known
any
other

arrangement
,
or
perhaps
very
carefully
considered
the
historical
*NL*
accounts

former
epochs
in

a
very
different

prevailed
,
*NL*
can
not
be
expected

stupor

Dr.

simple
statement
plunged
me
.

smiling
,
``

to
your
idea
of
wages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
I
had
pulled
myself
together
sufficiently
to
voice
some
*NL*
of
the
criticisms
which
,
man
of
the
nineteenth
century
as
I
was
,
came
*NL*
uppermost
in
my
mind
,
upon
this
to
me
astounding
arrangement
.
``
Some
*NL*
men
do
twice
the
work
of
others
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
Are
the
clever
workmen
*NL*
content
with
a
plan
that
ranks
them
with
the
indifferent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
leave
no
possible
ground
for
any
complaint
of
injustice
,
''
replied
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
``
by
requiring
precisely
the
same
measure
of
service
from
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
you
do
that
,
I
should
like
to
know
,
when
no
two
men
's
powers
*NL*
are
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
simpler
,
''
was
Dr.
Leete
's
reply
.
``
We
require
of
each
*NL*
that
he
shall
make
the
same
effort
;
that
is
,
we
demand
of
him
the
best
*NL*
service
it
is
in
his
power
to
give
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
supposing
all
do
the
best
they
can
,
''
I
answered
,
``
the
amount
of
*NL*
the
product
resulting
is
twice
greater
from
one
man
than
from
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
;
``
but
the
amount
of
the
resulting
*NL*
product
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
question
,
which
is
one
of
*NL*
desert
.
Desert
is
a
moral
question
,
and
the
amount
of
the
product
a
*NL*
material
quantity
.
It
would
be
an
extraordinary
sort
of
logic
which
*NL*
should
try
to
determine
a
moral
question
by
a
material
standard
.
The
*NL*
amount
of
the
effort
alone
is
pertinent
to
the
question
of
desert
.
All
*NL*
men
who
do
their
best
,
do
the
same
.
A
man
's
endowments
,
however
*NL*
godlike
,
merely
fix
the
measure
of
his
duty
.
The
man
of
great
*NL*
endowments
who
does
not
do
all
he
might
,
though
he
may
do
more
than
a
*NL*
man
of
small
endowments
who
does
his
best
,
is
deemed
a
less
deserving
*NL*
worker
than
the
latter
,
and
dies
a
debtor
to
his
fellows
.
The
Creator
*NL*
sets
men
's
tasks
for
them
by
the
faculties
he
gives
them
;
we
simply
*NL*
exact
their
fulfillment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
that
is
very
fine
philosophy
,
''
I
said
;
``
nevertheless
it
*NL*
seems
hard
that
the
man
who
produces
twice
as
much
as
another
,
even
if
*NL*
both
do
their
best
,
should
have
only
the
same
share
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
,
indeed
,
seem
so
to
you
?
''
responded
Dr.
Leete
.
``
Now
,
do
you
*NL*
know
,
that
seems
very
curious
to
me
?
The
way
it
strikes
people
*NL*
nowadays
is
,
that
a
man
who
can
produce
twice
as
much
as
another
with
*NL*
the
same
effort
,
instead
of
being
rewarded
for
doing
so
,
ought
to
be
*NL*
punished
if
he
does
not
do
so
.
In
the
nineteenth
century
,
when
a
horse
*NL*
pulled
a
heavier
load
than
a
goat
,
I
suppose
you
rewarded
him
.
Now
,
we
*NL*
should
have
whipped
him
soundly
if
he
had
not
,
on
the
ground
that
,
*NL*
being
much
stronger
,
he
ought
to
.
It
is
singular
how
ethical
standards
*NL*
change
.
''
The
doctor
said
this
with
such
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
that
I
*NL*
was
obliged
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
the
real
reason
that
we
rewarded
men
for
*NL*
their
endowments
,
while
we
considered
those
of
horses
and
goats
merely
*NL*
as
fixing
the
service
to
be
severally
required
of
them
,
was
that
the
*NL*
animals
,
not
being
reasoning
beings
,
naturally
did
the
best
they
*NL*
could
,
whereas
men
could
only
be
induced
to
do
so
by
rewarding
them
*NL*
according
to
the
amount
of
their
product
.
That
brings
me
to
ask
why
,
*NL*
unless
human
nature
has
mightily
changed
in
a
hundred
years
,
you
are
*NL*
not
under
the
same
necessity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
are
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
I
do
n't
think
there
has
been
any
change
*NL*
in
human
nature
in
that
respect
since
your
day
.
It
is
still
so
*NL*
constituted
that
special
incentives
in
the
form
of
prizes
,
and
*NL*
advantages
to
be
gained
,
are
requisite
to
call
out
the
best
endeavors
*NL*
of
the
average
man
in
any
direction
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
inducement
,
''
I
asked
,
``
can
a
man
have
to
put
forth
his
best
*NL*
endeavors
when
,
however
much
or
little
he
accomplishes
,
his
income
*NL*
remains
the
same
?
High
characters
may
be
moved
by
devotion
to
the
*NL*
common
welfare
under
such
a
system
,
but
does
not
the
average
man
tend
*NL*
to
rest
back
on
his
oar
,
reasoning
that
it
is
of
no
use
to
make
a
*NL*
special
effort
,
since
the
effort
will
not
increase
his
income
,
nor
its
*NL*
withholding
diminish
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
then
really
seem
to
you
,
''
answered
my
companion
,
``
that
human
*NL*
nature
is
insensible
to
any
motives
save
fear
of
want
and
love
of
*NL*
luxury
,
that
you
should
expect
security
and
equality
of
livelihood
to
*NL*
leave
them
without
possible
incentives
to
effort
?
Your
contemporaries
*NL*
did
not
really
think
so
,
though
they
might
fancy
they
did
.
When
it
was
*NL*
a
question
of
the
grandest
class
of
efforts
,
the
most
absolute
*NL*
self-devotion
,
they
depended
on
quite
other
incentives
.
Not
higher
*NL*
wages
,
but
honor
and
the
hope
of
men
's
gratitude
,
patriotism
and
the
*NL*
inspiration
of
duty
,
were
the
motives
which
they
set
before
their
*NL*
soldiers
when
it
was
a
question
of
dying
for
the
nation
,
and
never
*NL*
was
there
an
age
of
the
world
when
those
motives
did
not
call
out
what
*NL*
is
best
and
noblest
in
men
.
And
not
only
this
,
but
when
you
come
to
*NL*
analyze
the
love
of
money
which
was
the
general
impulse
to
effort
in
*NL*
your
day
,
you
find
that
the
dread
of
want
and
desire
of
luxury
was
but
*NL*
one
of
several
motives
which
the
pursuit
of
money
represented
;
the
*NL*
others
,
and
with
many
the
more
influential
,
being
desire
of
power
,
of
*NL*
social
position
,
and
reputation
for
ability
and
success
.
So
you
see
*NL*
that
though
we
have
abolished
poverty
and
the
fear
of
it
,
and
*NL*
inordinate
luxury
with
the
hope
of
it
,
we
have
not
touched
the
greater
*NL*
part
of
the
motives
which
underlay
the
love
of
money
in
former
times
,
*NL*
or
any
of
those
which
prompted
the
supremer
sorts
of
effort
.
The
*NL*
coarser
motives
,
which
no
longer
move
us
,
have
been
replaced
by
higher
*NL*
motives
wholly
unknown
to
the
mere
wage
earners
of
your
age
.
Now
that
*NL*
industry
of
whatever
sort
is
no
longer
self-service
,
but
service
of
*NL*
the
nation
,
patriotism
,
passion
for
humanity
,
impel
the
worker
as
in
*NL*
your
day
they
did
the
soldier
.
The
army
of
industry
is
an
army
,
not
*NL*
alone
by
virtue
of
its
perfect
organization
,
but
by
reason
also
of
the
*NL*
ardor
of
self-devotion
which
animates
its
members
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
as
you
used
to
supplement
the
motives
of
patriotism
with
the
love
*NL*
of
glory
,
in
order
to
stimulate
the
valor
of
your
soldiers
,
so
do
we
.
*NL*
Based
as
our
industrial
system
is
on
the
principle
of
requiring
the
*NL*
same
unit
of
effort
from
every
man
,
that
is
,
the
best
he
can
do
,
you
*NL*
will
see
that
the
means
by
which
we
spur
the
workers
to
do
their
best
*NL*
must
be
a
very
essential
part
of
our
scheme
.
With
us
,
diligence
in
the
*NL*
national
service
is
the
sole
and
certain
way
to
public
repute
,
social
*NL*
distinction
,
and
official
power
.
The
value
of
a
man
's
services
to
*NL*
society
fixes
his
rank
in
it
.
Compared
with
the
effect
of
our
social
*NL*
arrangements
in
impelling
men
to
be
zealous
in
business
,
we
deem
the
*NL*
object-lessons
of
biting
poverty
and
wanton
luxury
on
which
you
*NL*
depended
a
device
as
weak
and
uncertain
as
it
was
barbaric
.
The
lust
*NL*
of
honor
even
in
your
sordid
day
notoriously
impelled
men
to
more
*NL*
desperate
effort
than
the
love
of
money
could
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
extremely
interested
,
''
I
said
,
``
to
learn
something
of
*NL*
what
these
social
arrangements
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
scheme
in
its
details
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
is
of
course
very
*NL*
elaborate
,
for
it
underlies
the
entire
organization
of
our
industrial
*NL*
army
;
but
a
few
words
will
give
you
a
general
idea
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
our
talk
was
charmingly
interrupted
by
the
emergence
*NL*
upon
the
aerial
platform
where
we
sat
of
Edith
Leete
.
She
was
dressed
*NL*
for
the
street
,
and
had
come
to
speak
to
her
father
about
some
*NL*
commission
she
was
to
do
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
Edith
,
''
he
exclaimed
,
as
she
was
about
to
leave
us
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
``
I
wonder
if
Mr.
West
would
not
be
interested
in
visiting
*NL*
the
store
with
you
?
I
have
been
telling
him
something
about
our
system
*NL*
of
distribution
,
and
perhaps
he
might
like
to
see
it
in
practical
*NL*
operation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughter
,
''
he
added
,
turning
to
me
,
``
is
an
indefatigable
shopper
,
*NL*
and
can
tell
you
more
about
the
stores
than
I
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
proposition
was
naturally
very
agreeable
to
me
,
and
Edith
being
*NL*
good
enough
to
say
that
she
should
be
glad
to
have
my
company
,
we
left
*NL*
the
house
together

CHAPTER
X.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
going
to
explain
our
way
of
shopping
to
you
,
''
said
my
*NL*
companion
,
as
we
walked
along
the
street
,
``
you
must
explain
your
way
*NL*
to
me
.
I
have
never
been
able
to
understand
it
from
all
I
have
read
on
*NL*
the
subject
.
For
example
,
when
you
had
such
a
vast
number
of
shops
,
*NL*
each
with
its
different
assortment
,
how
could
a
lady
ever
settle
upon
*NL*
any
purchase
till
she
had
visited
all
the
shops
?
for
,
until
she
had
,
*NL*
she
could
not
know
what
there
was
to
choose
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
as
you
suppose
;
that
was
the
only
way
she
could
know
,
''
I
*NL*
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Father
calls
me
an
indefatigable
shopper
,
but
I
should
soon
be
a
very
*NL*
fatigued
one
if
I
had
to
do
as
they
did
,
''
was
Edith
's
laughing
*NL*
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
loss
of
time
in
going
from
shop
to
shop
was
indeed
a
waste
which
*NL*
the
busy
bitterly
complained
of
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
as
for
the
ladies
of
*NL*
the
idle
class
,
though
they
complained
also
,
I
think
the
system
was
*NL*
really
a
godsend
by
furnishing
a
device
to
kill
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
say
there
were
a
thousand
shops
in
a
city
,
hundreds
,
perhaps
,
of
*NL*
the
same
sort
,
how
could
even
the
idlest
find
time
to
make
their
*NL*
rounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
really
could
not
visit
all
,
of
course
,
''
I
replied
.
``
Those
who
*NL*
did
a
great
deal
of
buying
,
learned
in
time
where
they
might
expect
to
*NL*
find
what
they
wanted
.
This
class
had
made
a
science
of
the
*NL*
specialties
of
the
shops
,
and
bought
at
advantage
,
always
getting
the
*NL*
most
and
best
for
the
least
money
.
It
required
,
however
,
long
*NL*
experience
to
acquire
this
knowledge
.
Those
who
were
too
busy
,
or
*NL*
bought
too
little
to
gain
it
,
took
their
chances
and
were
generally
*NL*
unfortunate
,
getting
the
least
and
worst
for
the
most
money
.
It
was
*NL*
the
merest
chance
if
persons
not
experienced
in
shopping
received
the
*NL*
value
of
their
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
did
you
put
up
with
such
a
shockingly
inconvenient
*NL*
arrangement
when
you
saw
its
faults
so
plainly
?
''
Edith
asked
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
like
all
our
social
arrangements
,
''
I
replied
.
``
You
can
see
*NL*
their
faults
scarcely
more
plainly
than
we
did
,
but
we
saw
no
remedy
*NL*
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
we
are
at
the
store
of
our
ward
,
''
said
Edith
,
as
we
turned
in
at
*NL*
the
great
portal
of
one
of
the
magnificent
public
buildings
I
had
*NL*
observed
in
my
morning
walk
.
There
was
nothing
in
the
exterior
aspect
*NL*
of
the
edifice
to
suggest
a
store
to
a
representative
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
.
There
was
no
display
of
goods
in
the
great
*NL*
windows
,
or
any
device
to
advertise
wares
,
or
attract
custom
.
Nor
was
*NL*
there
any
sort
of
sign
or
legend
on
the
front
of
the
building
to
*NL*
indicate
the
character
of
the
business
carried
on
there
;
but
instead
,
*NL*
above
the
portal
,
standing
out
from
the
front
of
the
building
,
a
*NL*
majestic
life-size
group
of
statuary
,
the
central
figure
of
which
was
*NL*
a
female
ideal
of
Plenty
,
with
her
cornucopia
.
Judging
from
the
*NL*
composition
of
the
throng
passing
in
and
out
,
about
the
same
*NL*
proportion
of
the
sexes
among
shoppers
obtained
as
in
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
.
As
we
entered
,
Edith
said
that
there
was
one
of
these
great
*NL*
distributing
establishments
in
each
ward
of
the
city
,
so
that
no
*NL*
residence
was
more
than
five
or
ten
minutes
'
walk
from
one
of
them
.
It
*NL*
was
the
first
interior
of
a
twentieth-century
public
building
that
I
*NL*
had
ever
beheld
,
and
the
spectacle
naturally
impressed
me
deeply
.
I
*NL*
was
in
a
vast
hall
full
of
light
,
received
not
alone
from
the
windows
*NL*
on
all
sides
,
but
from
the
dome
,
the
point
of
which
was
a
hundred
feet
*NL*
above
.
Beneath
it
,
in
the
centre
of
the
hall
,
a
magnificent
fountain
*NL*
played
,
cooling
the
atmosphere
to
a
delicious
freshness
with
its
*NL*
spray
.
The
walls
and
ceiling
were
frescoed
in
mellow
tints
,
calculated
*NL*
to
soften
without
absorbing
the
light
which
flooded
the
interior
.
*NL*
Around
the
fountain
was
a
space
occupied
with
chairs
and
sofas
,
on
*NL*
which
many
persons
were
seated
conversing
.
Legends
on
the
walls
all
*NL*
about
the
hall
indicated
to
what
classes
of
commodities
the
counters
*NL*
below
were
devoted
.
Edith
directed
her
steps
towards
one
of
these
,
*NL*
where
samples
of
muslin
of
a
bewildering
variety
were
displayed
,
and
*NL*
proceeded
to
inspect
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
the
clerk
?
''
I
asked
,
for
there
was
no
one
behind
the
*NL*
counter
,
and
no
one
seemed
coming
to
attend
to
the
customer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
need
of
the
clerk
yet
,
''
said
Edith
;
``
I
have
not
made
my
*NL*
selection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
principal
business
of
clerks
to
help
people
to
make
their
*NL*
selections
in
my
day
,
''
I
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
To
tell
people
what
they
wanted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
and
oftener
to
induce
them
to
buy
what
they
did
n't
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
did
not
ladies
find
that
very
impertinent
?
''
Edith
asked
,
*NL*
wonderingly
.
``
What
concern
could
it
possibly
be
to
the
clerks
whether
*NL*
people
bought
or
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
their
sole
concern
,
''
I
answered
.
``
They
were
hired
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
getting
rid
of
the
goods
,
and
were
expected
to
do
their
*NL*
utmost
,
short
of
the
use
of
force
,
to
compass
that
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
How
stupid
I
am
to
forget
!
''
said
Edith
.
``
The
storekeeper
and
*NL*
his
clerks
depended
for
their
livelihood
on
selling
the
goods
in
your
*NL*
day
.
Of
course
that
is
all
different
now
.
The
goods
are
the
nation
's
.
*NL*
They
are
here
for
those
who
want
them
,
and
it
is
the
business
of
the
*NL*
clerks
to
wait
on
people
and
take
their
orders
;
but
it
is
not
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
clerk
or
the
nation
to
dispose
of
a
yard
or
a
pound
of
*NL*
anything
to
anybody
who
does
not
want
it
.
''
She
smiled
as
she
added
,
*NL*
``
How
exceedingly
odd
it
must
have
seemed
to
have
clerks
trying
to
*NL*
induce
one
to
take
what
one
did
not
want
,
or
was
doubtful
about
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
even
a
twentieth-century
clerk
might
make
himself
useful
in
*NL*
giving
you
information
about
the
goods
,
though
he
did
not
tease
you
to
*NL*
buy
them
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Edith
,
``
that
is
not
the
business
of
the
clerk
.
These
*NL*
printed
cards
,
for
which
the
government
authorities
are
responsible
,
*NL*
give
us
all
the
information
we
can
possibly
need
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
saw
then
that
there
was
fastened
to
each
sample
a
card
containing
in
*NL*
succinct
form
a
complete
statement
of
the
make
and
materials
of
the
*NL*
goods
and
all
its
qualities
,
as
well
as
price
,
leaving
absolutely
no
*NL*
point
to
hang
a
question
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
clerk
has
,
then
,
nothing
to
say
about
the
goods
he
sells
?
''
I
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
at
all
.
It
is
not
necessary
that
he
should
know
or
profess
to
*NL*
know
anything
about
them
.
Courtesy
and
accuracy
in
taking
orders
are
*NL*
all
that
are
required
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
prodigious
amount
of
lying
that
simple
arrangement
saves
!
''
I
*NL*
ejaculated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
that
all
the
clerks
misrepresented
their
goods
in
your
*NL*
day
?
''
Edith
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
forbid
that
I
should
say
so
!
''
I
replied
,
``
for
there
were
many
who
*NL*
did
not
,
and
they
were
entitled
to
especial
credit
,
for
when
one
's
*NL*
livelihood
and
that
of
his
wife
and
babies
depended
on
the
amount
of
*NL*
goods
he
could
dispose
of
,
the
temptation
to
deceive
the
customer
--
or
*NL*
let
him
deceive
himself
--
was
wellnigh
overwhelming
.
But
,
Miss
Leete
,
I
*NL*
am
distracting
you
from
your
task
with
my
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all

I
have
made
my
selections

''
With
that
she
touched
a
*NL*
button
,
and
in
a
moment
a
clerk
appeared
.
He
took
down
her
order
on
a
*NL*
tablet
with
a
pencil
which
made
two
copies
,
of
which
he
gave
one
to
*NL*
her
,
and
enclosing
the
counterpart
in
a
small
receptacle
,
dropped
it
*NL*
into
a
transmitting
tube
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
duplicate
of
the
order

''
said
Edith
as
she
turned
away
from
the
*NL*
counter
,
after
the
clerk
had
punched
the
value
of
her
purchase
out
of
*NL*
the
credit
card
she
gave
him
,
``
is
given
to
the
purchaser

so

mistakes
in
filling
it

be
easily
traced
and
rectified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
very
quick
about
your
selections
,
''
I
said
.
``
May
I
ask
how
*NL*
you
knew
that
you
might
not
have
found
something
to
suit
you
better
in
*NL*
some
of
the
other
stores
?
But
probably
you
are
required
to
buy
in
your
*NL*
own
district
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
,
''
she
replied
.
``
We
buy
where
we
please
,
though
naturally
most
*NL*
often
near
home
.
But
I
should
have
gained
nothing
by
visiting
other
*NL*
stores
.
The
assortment
in
all
is
exactly
the
same
,
representing
as
it
*NL*
does
in
each
case
samples
of
all
the
varieties
produced
or
imported
by
*NL*
the
United
States
.
That
is
why
one
can
decide
quickly
,
and
never
need
*NL*
visit
two
stores
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
is
this
merely
a
sample
store
?
I
see
no
clerks
cutting
off
goods
*NL*
or
marking
bundles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
our
stores
are
sample
stores
,
except
as
to
a
few
classes
of
*NL*
articles
.
The
goods
,
with
these
exceptions
,
are
all
at
the
great
*NL*
central
warehouse
of
the
city
,
to
which
they
are
shipped
directly
from
*NL*
the
producers
.
We
order
from
the
sample
and
the
printed
statement
of
*NL*
texture
,
make
,
and
qualities
.
The
orders
are
sent
to
the
warehouse
,
*NL*
and
the
goods
distributed
from
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
be
a
tremendous
saving
of
handling
,
''
I
said
.
``
By
our
*NL*
system
,
the
manufacturer
sold
to
the
wholesaler
,
the
wholesaler
to
the
*NL*
retailer
,
and
the
retailer
to
the
consumer
,
and
the
goods
had
to
be
*NL*
handled
each
time
.
You
avoid
one
handling
of
the
goods
,
and
eliminate
*NL*
the
retailer
altogether
,
with
his
big
profit
and
the
army
of
clerks
it
*NL*
goes
to
support
.
Why
,
Miss
Leete
,
this
store
is
merely
the
order
*NL*
department
of
a
wholesale
house
,
with
no
more
than
a
wholesaler
's
*NL*
complement
of
clerks
.
Under
our
system
of
handling
the
goods
,
*NL*
persuading
the
customer
to
buy
them
,
cutting
them
off
,
and
packing
*NL*
them
,
ten
clerks
would
not
do
what
one
does
here
.
The
saving
must
be
*NL*
enormous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
so
,
''
said
Edith
,
``
but
of
course
we
have
never
known
any
*NL*
other
way
.
But
,
Mr.
West
,
you
must
not
fail
to
ask
father
to
take
you
*NL*
to
the
central
warehouse
some
day
,
where
they
receive
the
orders
from
*NL*
the
different
sample
houses
all
over
the
city
and
parcel
out
and
send
*NL*
the
goods
to
their
destinations
.
He
took
me
there
not
long
ago
,
and
*NL*
it
was
a
wonderful
sight
.
The
system
is
certainly
perfect
;
for
*NL*
example
,
over
yonder
in
that
sort
of
cage
is
the
dispatching
clerk
.
*NL*
The
orders
,
as
they
are
taken
by
the
different
departments
in
the
*NL*
store
,
are
sent
by
transmitters
to
him
.
His
assistants
sort
them
and
*NL*
enclose
each
class
in
a
carrier-box
by
itself
.
The
dispatching
clerk
*NL*
has
a
dozen
pneumatic
transmitters
before
him
answering
to
the
general
*NL*
classes
of
goods
,
each
communicating
with
the
corresponding
department
*NL*
at
the
warehouse
.
He
drops
the
box
of
orders
into
the
tube
it
calls
*NL*
for
,
and
in
a
few
moments
later
it
drops
on
the
proper
desk
in
the
*NL*
warehouse
,
together
with
all
the
orders
of
the
same
sort
from
the
*NL*
other
sample
stores
.
The
orders
are
read
off
,
recorded
,
and
sent
to
be
*NL*
filled
,
like
lightning
.
The
filling
I
thought
the
most
interesting
*NL*
part
.
Bales
of
cloth
are
placed
on
spindles
and
turned
by
machinery
,
*NL*
and
the
cutter
,
who
also
has
a
machine
,
works
right
through
one
bale
*NL*
after
another
till
exhausted
,
when
another
man
takes
his
place
;
and
it
*NL*
is
the
same
with
those
who
fill
the
orders
in
any
other
staple
.
The
*NL*
packages
are
then
delivered
by
larger
tubes
to
the
city
districts
,
and
*NL*
thence
distributed
to
the
houses
.
You
may
understand
how
quickly
it
is
*NL*
all
done
when
I
tell
you
that
my
order
will
probably
be
at
home
sooner
*NL*
than
I
could
have
carried
it
from
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
manage
in
the
thinly
settled
rural
districts
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
system
is
the
same
,
''
Edith
explained
;
``
the
village
sample
shops
*NL*
are
connected
by
transmitters
with
the
central
county
warehouse
,
which
*NL*
may
be
twenty
miles
away
.
The
transmission
is
so
swift
,
though
,
that
*NL*
the
time
lost
on
the
way
is
trifling
.
But
,
to
save
expense
,
in
many
*NL*
counties
one
set
of
tubes
connect
several
villages
with
the
warehouse
,
*NL*
and
then
there
is
time
lost
waiting
for
one
another
.
Sometimes
it
is
*NL*
two
or
three
hours
before
goods
ordered
are
received
.
It
was
so
where
*NL*
I
was
staying
last
summer
,
and
I
found
it
quite
inconvenient

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
must
be
many
other
respects
also
,
no
doubt
,
in
which
the
*NL*
country
stores
are
inferior
to
the
city
stores
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
Edith
answered
,
``
they
are
otherwise
precisely
as
good

The
*NL*

shop

smallest
village
,
just
like
this
one

gives
you
*NL*
your
choice
of
all
the
varieties
of
goods
the
nation
has
,
for
the
*NL*
county
warehouse
draws
on
the
same
source
as
the
city
warehouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
walked
home
I
commented
on
the
great
variety
in
the
size
and
*NL*
cost
of
the
houses
.
``
How
is
it
,
''
I
asked
,
``
that
this
difference
is
*NL*
consistent
with
the
fact
that
all
citizens
have
the
same
income
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
,
''
Edith
explained
,
``
although
the
income
is
the
same
,
personal
*NL*
taste
determines
how
the
individual
shall
spend
it
.
Some
like
fine
*NL*
horses
;
others
,
like
myself
,
prefer
pretty
clothes
;
and
still
others
*NL*
want
an
elaborate
table
.
The
rents
which
the
nation
receives
for
these
*NL*
houses
vary
,
according
to
size
,
elegance
,
and
location
,
so
that
*NL*
everybody
can
find
something
to
suit
.
The
larger
houses
are
usually
*NL*
occupied
by
large
families
,
in
which
there
are
several
to
contribute
*NL*
to
the
rent
;
while
small
families
,
like
ours
,
find
smaller
houses
more
*NL*
convenient
and
economical
.
It
is
a
matter
of
taste
and
convenience
*NL*
wholly
.
I
have
read
that
in
old
times
people
often
kept
up
*NL*
establishments
and
did
other
things
which
they
could
not
afford
for
*NL*
ostentation
,
to
make
people
think
them
richer
than
they
were

Was
it
*NL*
really
so

Mr.
West

*NL*
*NL*

I
shall

I
replied

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
you
see
,
it
could
not

known

When

returned

not
visible

ought
to
apologize
for
inquiring

said

It
is
not

question

ask
one
another

but
I
have
read
that
in
your
day
,
*NL*
even
among
the
cultured
class
,
there
were
some
who
did
not
care
for
*NL*
music

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
remember
,
in
excuse

I
said

``
that
we
had
some
rather

absurd
kinds

music

*NL*
``
Yes

she
said
,
``
I
know
that

some
of
ours
now

Nothing

said

``
To
me

she
exclaimed

laughing

Did

Seeing
that
I
was
a
little
abashed
,
she
subdued
her
merriment
and
*NL*
explained
.
``
Of
course
,
we
all
sing
nowadays
as
a
matter
of
course
in
*NL*
the
training
of
the
voice
,
and
some
learn
to
play
instruments
for
*NL*
their
private
amusement
;
but
the
professional
music
is
so
much
grander
*NL*
and
more
perfect
than
any
performance
of
ours
,
and
so
easily
commanded
*NL*
when
we
wish
to
hear
it
,
that
we
do
n't
think
of
calling
our
singing
or
*NL*
playing
music
at
all
.
All
the
really
fine
singers
and
players
are
in
*NL*
the
musical
service
,
and
the
rest
of
us
hold
our
peace
for
the
main
*NL*
part
.
But
would
you
really
like
to
hear
some
music
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
assured
her
once
more
that
I
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
then
,
into
the
music
room
,
''
she
said
,
and
I
followed
her
into
*NL*
an
apartment
finished
,
without
hangings
,
in
wood
,
with
a
floor
of
*NL*
polished
wood
.
I
was
prepared
for
new
devices
in
musical
instruments
,
*NL*
but
I
saw
nothing
in
the
room
which
by
any
stretch
of
imagination
*NL*
could
be
conceived
as
such
.
It
was
evident
that
my
puzzled
appearance
*NL*
was
affording
intense
amusement
to
Edith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
look
at
to-day
's
music
,
''
she
said
,
handing
me
a
card
,
``
and
*NL*
tell
me
what
you
would
prefer
.
It
is
now
five
o'clock
,
you
will
*NL*
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
card
bore
the
date
``
September
12
,
2000
,
''
and
contained
the
longest
*NL*
programme
of
music
I
had
ever
seen
.
It
was
as
various
as
it
was
long
,
*NL*
including
a
most
extraordinary
range
of
vocal
and
instrumental
solos
,
*NL*
duets
,
quartettes
,
and
various
orchestral
combinations
.
I
remained
*NL*
bewildered
by
the
prodigious
list
until
Edith
's
pink
finger-tip
*NL*
indicated
a
particular
section
of
it
,
where
several
selections
were
*NL*
bracketed
,
with
the
words
``
5
P.M.
''
against
them
;
then
I
observed
*NL*
that
this
prodigious
programme
was
an
all-day
one
,
divided
into
*NL*
twenty-four
sections
answering
to
the
hours
.
There
were
but
a
few
*NL*
pieces
of
music
in
the
``
5
P.M.
''
section
,
and
I
indicated
an
organ
*NL*
piece
as
my
preference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
you
like
the
organ
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
think
there
is
*NL*
scarcely
any
music
that
suits
my
mood
oftener
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
me
sit
down
comfortably
,
and
,
crossing
the
room
,
so
far
as
I
*NL*
could
see
,
merely
touched
one
or
two
screws
,
and
at
once
the
room
was
*NL*
filled
with
the
music
of
a
grand
organ
anthem
;
filled
,
not
flooded
,
*NL*
for
,
by
some
means
,
the
volume
of
melody
had
been
perfectly
graduated
*NL*
to
the
size
of
the
apartment
.
I
listened
,
scarcely
breathing
,
to
the
*NL*
close
.
Such
music
,
so
perfectly
rendered
,
I
had
never
expected
to
*NL*
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Grand
!
''
I
cried
,
as
the
last
great
wave
of
sound
broke
and
ebbed
away
*NL*
into
silence
.
``
Bach
must
be
at
the
keys
of
that
organ
;
but
where
is
*NL*
the
organ
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
a
moment
,
please
,
''
said
Edith
;
``
I
want
to
have
you
listen
to
*NL*
this
waltz
before
you
ask
any
questions
.
I
think
it
is
perfectly
*NL*
charming
;
''
and
as
she
spoke
the
sound
of
violins
filled
the
room
with
*NL*
the
witchery
of
a
summer
night
.
When
this
had
also
ceased
,
she
said
:
*NL*
``
There
is
nothing
in
the
least
mysterious
about
the
music
,
as
you
seem
*NL*
to
imagine
.
It
is
not
made
by
fairies
or
genii
,
but
by
good
,
honest
,
*NL*
and
exceedingly
clever
human
hands
.
We
have
simply
carried
the
idea
of
*NL*
labor
saving
by
cooperation
into
our
musical
service
as
into
*NL*
everything
else
.
There
are
a
number
of
music
rooms
in
the
city
,
*NL*
perfectly
adapted
acoustically
to
the
different
sorts
of
music
.
These
*NL*
halls
are
connected
by
telephone
with
all
the
houses
of
the
city
whose
*NL*
people
care
to
pay
the
small
fee
,
and
there
are
none
,
you
may
be
sure
,
*NL*
who
do
not
.
The
corps
of
musicians
attached
to
each
hall
is
so
large
*NL*
that
,
although
no
individual
performer
,
or
group
of
performers
,
has
*NL*
more
than
a
brief
part
,
each
day
's
programme
lasts
through
the
*NL*
twenty-four
hours
.
There
are
on
that
card
for
to-day
,
as
you
will
see
*NL*
if
you
observe
closely
,
distinct
programmes
of
four
of
these
concerts
,
*NL*
each
of
a
different
order
of
music
from
the
others
,
being
now
*NL*
simultaneously
performed
,
and
any
one
of
the
four
pieces
now
going
on
*NL*
that
you
prefer
,
you
can
hear
by
merely
pressing
the
button
which
will
*NL*
connect
your
house-wire
with
the
hall
where
it
is
being
rendered
.
The
*NL*
programmes
are
so
coordinated
that
the
pieces
at
any
one
time
*NL*
simultaneously
proceeding
in
the
different
halls
usually
offer
a
*NL*
choice
,
not
only
between
instrumental
and
vocal
,
and
between
different
*NL*
sorts
of
instruments
;
but
also
between
different
motives
from
grave
to
*NL*
gay
,
so
that
all
tastes
and
moods
can
be
suited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
appears
to
me
,
Miss
Leete
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
if
we
could
have
devised
*NL*
an
arrangement
for
providing
everybody
with
music
in
their
homes
,
*NL*
perfect
in
quality
,
unlimited
in
quantity
,
suited
to
every
mood
,
and
*NL*
beginning
and
ceasing
at
will
,
we
should
have
considered
the
limit
of
*NL*
human
felicity
already
attained
,
and
ceased
to
strive
for
further
*NL*
improvements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
never
could
imagine
how
those
among
you
who
depended
at
*NL*
all
on
music
managed
to
endure
the
old-fashioned
system
for
providing
*NL*
it
,
''
replied
Edith
.
``
Music
really
worth
hearing
must
have
been
,
I
*NL*
suppose
,
wholly
out
of
the
reach
of
the
masses
,
and
attainable
by
the
*NL*
most
favored
only
occasionally
,
at
great
trouble
,
prodigious
expense
,
*NL*
and
then
for
brief
periods
,
arbitrarily
fixed
by
somebody
else
,
and
in
*NL*
connection
with
all
sorts
of
undesirable
circumstances
.
Your
concerts
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
and
operas
!
How
perfectly
exasperating
it
must
have
*NL*
been
,
for
the
sake
of
a
piece
or
two
of
music
that
suited
you
,
to
have
*NL*
to
sit
for
hours
listening
to
what
you
did
not
care
for
!
Now
,
at
a
*NL*
dinner
one
can
skip
the
courses
one
does
not
care
for
.
Who
would
ever
*NL*
dine
,
however
hungry
,
if
required
to
eat
everything
brought
on
the
*NL*
table
?
and
I
am
sure
one
's
hearing
is
quite
as
sensitive
as
one
's
*NL*
taste
.
I
suppose
it
was
these
difficulties
in
the
way
of
commanding
*NL*
really
good
music
which
made
you
endure
so
much
playing
and
singing
in
*NL*
your
homes
by
people
who
had
only
the
rudiments
of
the
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
replied
,
``
it
was
that
sort
of
music
or
none
for
most
of
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
well
,
''
Edith
sighed
,
``
when
one
really
considers
,
it
is
not
so
*NL*
strange
that
people
in
those
days
so
often
did
not
care
for
music
.
I
*NL*
dare
say
I
should
have
detested
it
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
I
understand
you
rightly
,
''
I
inquired
,
``
that
this
musical
*NL*
programme
covers
the
entire
twenty-four
hours
?
It
seems
to
on
this
*NL*
card
,
certainly
;
but
who
is
there
to
listen
to
music
between
say
*NL*
midnight
and
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
many
,
''
Edith
replied
.
``
Our
people
keep
all
hours
;
but
if
the
*NL*
music
were
provided
from
midnight
to
morning
for
no
others
,
it
still
*NL*
would
be
for
the
sleepless
,
the
sick
,
and
the
dying
.
All
our
*NL*
bedchambers
have
a
telephone
attachment
at
the
head
of
the
bed
by
*NL*
which
any
person
who
may
be
sleepless
can
command
music
at
pleasure
,
*NL*
of
the
sort
suited
to
the
mood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
there
such
an
arrangement
in
the
room
assigned
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
certainly
;
and
how
stupid
,
how
very
stupid
,
of
me
not
to
think
*NL*
to
tell
you
of
that
last
night
!
Father
will
show
you
about
the
*NL*
adjustment
before
you
go
to
bed
to-night
,
however
;
and
with
the
*NL*
receiver
at
your
ear
,
I
am
quite
sure
you
will
be
able
to
snap
your

fingers
at
all
sorts
of
uncanny
feelings
if
they
trouble
you
again

*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Dr.
Leete
asked
us
about
our
visit
to
the
store
,
and
in
*NL*
the
course
of
the
desultory
comparison
of
the
ways
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
and
the
twentieth
,
which
followed
,
something
raised
the
*NL*
question
of
inheritance
.
``
I
suppose
,
''
I
said
,
``
the
inheritance
of
*NL*
property
is
not
now
allowed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
there
is
no
interference
with
*NL*
it
.
In
fact
,
you
will
find
,
Mr.
West
,
as
you
come
to
know
us
,
that
*NL*
there
is
far
less
interference
of
any
sort
with
personal
liberty
*NL*
nowadays
than
you
were
accustomed
to
.
We
require
,
indeed
,
by
law
that
*NL*
every
man
shall
serve
the
nation
for
a
fixed
period
,
instead
of
*NL*
leaving
him
his
choice
,
as
you
did
,
between
working
,
stealing
,
or
*NL*
starving
.
With
the
exception
of
this
fundamental
law
,
which
is
,
*NL*
indeed
,
merely
a
codification
of
the
law
of
nature
--
the
edict
of
*NL*
Eden
--
by
which
it
is
made
equal
in
its
pressure
on
men
,
our
system
*NL*
depends
in
no
particular
upon
legislation
,
but
is
entirely
voluntary
,
*NL*
the
logical
outcome
of
the
operation
of
human
nature
under
rational
*NL*
conditions
.
This
question
of
inheritance
illustrates
just
that
point
.
*NL*
The
fact
that
the
nation
is
the
sole
capitalist
and
land-owner
of
*NL*
course
restricts
the
individual
's
possessions
to
his
annual
credit
,
*NL*
and
what
personal
and
household
belongings
he
may
have
procured
with
*NL*
it
.
His
credit
,
like
an
annuity
in
your
day
,
ceases
on
his
death
,
with
*NL*
the
allowance
of
a
fixed
sum
for
funeral
expenses
.
His
other
*NL*
possessions
he
leaves
as
he
pleases
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
to
prevent
,
in
course
of
time
,
such
accumulations
of
valuable
*NL*
goods
and
chattels
in
the
hands
of
individuals
as
might
seriously
*NL*
interfere
with
equality
in
the
circumstances
of
citizens
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
matter
arranges
itself
very
simply
,
''
was
the
reply
.
``
Under
the
*NL*
present
organization
of
society
,
accumulations
of
personal
property
*NL*
are
merely
burdensome
the
moment
they
exceed
what
adds
to
the
real
*NL*
comfort
.
In
your
day
,
if
a
man
had
a
house
crammed
full
with
gold
and
*NL*
silver
plate
,
rare
china
,
expensive
furniture
,
and
such
things
,
he
was
*NL*
considered
rich
,
for
these
things
represented
money
,
and
could
at
any
*NL*
time
be
turned
into
it
.
Nowadays
a
man
whom
the
legacies
of
a
hundred
*NL*
relatives
,
simultaneously
dying
,
should
place
in
a
similar
position
,
*NL*
would
be
considered
very
unlucky
.
The
articles
,
not
being
salable
,
*NL*
would
be
of
no
value
to
him
except
for
their
actual
use
or
the
*NL*
enjoyment
of
their
beauty
.
On
the
other
hand
,
his
income
remaining
the
*NL*
same
,
he
would
have
to
deplete
his
credit
to
hire
houses
to
store
the
*NL*
goods
in
,
and
still
further
to
pay
for
the
service
of
those
who
took
*NL*
care
of
them
.
You
may
be
very
sure
that
such
a
man
would
lose
no
time
*NL*
in
scattering
among
his
friends
possessions
which
only
made
him
the
*NL*
poorer
,
and
that
none
of
those
friends
would
accept
more
of
them
than
*NL*
they
could
easily
spare
room
for
and
time
to
attend
to
.
You
see
,
then
,
*NL*
that
to
prohibit
the
inheritance
of
personal
property
with
a
view
to
*NL*
prevent
great
accumulations
would
be
a
superfluous
precaution
for
the
*NL*
nation
.
The
individual
citizen
can
be
trusted
to
see
that
he
is
not
*NL*
overburdened
.
So
careful
is
he
in
this
respect
,
that
the
relatives
*NL*
usually
waive
claim
to
most
of
the
effects
of
deceased
friends
,
*NL*
reserving
only
particular
objects
.
The
nation
takes
charge
of
the
*NL*
resigned
chattels
,
and
turns
such
as
are
of
value
into
the
common
*NL*
stock
once
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spoke
of
paying
for
service
to
take
care
of
your
houses
,
''
said
I
;
*NL*
``
that
suggests
a
question
I
have
several
times
been
on
the
point
of
*NL*
asking
.
How
have
you
disposed
of
the
problem
of
domestic
service
?
Who
*NL*
are
willing
to
be
domestic
servants
in
a
community
where
all
are
*NL*
social
equals
?
Our
ladies
found
it
hard
enough
to
find
such
even
when
*NL*
there
was
little
pretense
of
social
equality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
precisely
because
we
are
all
social
equals
whose
equality
*NL*
nothing
can
compromise
,
and
because
service
is
honorable
,
in
a
society
*NL*
whose
fundamental
principle
is
that
all
in
turn
shall
serve
the
rest
,
*NL*
that
we
could
easily
provide
a
corps
of
domestic
servants
such
as
you
*NL*
never
dreamed
of
,
if
we
needed
them

replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
But
we
do
*NL*
not
need
them

``
Who
does
your
housework

then

I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
none
to
do

''
said
Mrs.
Leete
,
to
whom
I
had
addressed
this
*NL*
question
.
``
Our
washing

all
done

cheap

*NL*
Electricity
,
of

,
takes
the
place
of
all
fires
and
lighting
.
We
*NL*
choose
houses
no
larger
than
we
need
,
and
furnish
them
so
as
to
*NL*
involve
the
minimum
of
trouble
to
keep
them
in
order
.
We
have
no
use
*NL*
for
domestic
servants

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
that
you
had
in
the
poorer
classes
a
*NL*
boundless
supply
of
serfs
on
whom
you
could
impose
all
sorts
of
*NL*
painful
and
disagreeable
tasks
,
made
you
indifferent
to
devices
to
*NL*
avoid
the
necessity
for
them
.
But
now
that
we
all
have
to
do
in
turn
*NL*
whatever
work
is
done
for
society
,
every
individual
in
the
nation
has
*NL*
the
same
interest
,
and
a
personal
one
,
in
devices
for
lightening
the
*NL*
burden
.
This
fact
has
given
a
prodigious
impulse
to
labor-saving
*NL*
inventions
in
all
sorts
of
industry
,
of
which
the
combination
of
the
*NL*
maximum
of
comfort
and
minimum
of
trouble
in
household
arrangements
*NL*
was
one
of
the
earliest
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
case
of
special
emergencies
in
the
household

''
pursued
Dr.
Leete
,
*NL*
``
such
as
extensive
cleaning

renovation

sickness

*NL*
we
can
always
secure
assistance
from
the
industrial
force

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
recompense
these
assistants
,
since
you
have
no
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
not
pay
them

of
course
,
but
the
nation
for
them

Their
*NL*
services
can
be
obtained
by
application
at
the
proper
bureau

*NL*
their
value
is

*NL*
``
What
a

I
exclaimed

*NL*
``
In
my
day

even

the

martyrs
to
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
said
Mrs.
Leete
,
``
I
have
read
something
of
that
;
enough
to
*NL*
convince
me
that
,
badly
off
as
the
men

too
,
were
in
your
day

they
*NL*
were
more
fortunate

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
broad
shoulders
of
the
nation
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
bear
now
like
a
*NL*
feather
the
burden
that
broke
the
backs
of
the
women
of
your
day

*NL*
Their
misery
came
,
with
all
your
other
miseries
,
from
that
incapacity
*NL*
for
cooperation
which
followed
from
the
individualism
on
which
your
*NL*
social
system
was
founded
,
from
your
inability
to
perceive
that
you
*NL*
could
make
ten
times
more
profit
out
of
your
fellow

by
uniting
*NL*
with

than
by

The
wonder
is
,
not
that
you
*NL*
did
not
live
more
comfortably
,
but
that
you
were
able
to
live
together
*NL*
at
all
,
who
were
all
confessedly
bent
on
making
one
another
your

securing

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

there

you
are
so
vehement

Mr.

will
think

him

''
laughingly
interposed
Edith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
want
a
doctor
,
''
I
asked
,
``
do
you
simply
apply
to
the
proper
*NL*
bureau
and
take
any
one
that
may
be
sent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
rule
would
not
work
well
in
the
case
of
physicians
,
''
replied
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
.
``
The
good
a
physician
can
do
a
patient
depends
largely
on
his
*NL*
acquaintance
with
his
constitutional
tendencies
and
condition
.
The
*NL*
patient
must
be
able
,
therefore
,
to
call
in
a
particular
doctor
,
and
*NL*
he
does
so
just
as
patients
did
in
your
day
.
The
only
difference
is
*NL*
that
,
instead
of
collecting
his
fee
for
himself
,
the
doctor
collects
*NL*
it
for
the
nation
by
pricking
off
the
amount
,
according
to
a
regular
*NL*
scale
for
medical
attendance
,
from
the
patient
's
credit
card
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
imagine
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
if
the
fee
is
always
the
same
,
and
a
*NL*
doctor
may
not
turn
away
patients
,
as
I
suppose
he
may
not
,
the
good
*NL*
doctors
are
called
constantly
and
the
poor
doctors
left
in
idleness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
if
you
will
overlook
the
apparent
conceit
of
the
*NL*
remark
from
a
retired
physician
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
with
a
smile
,
``
we
*NL*
have
no
poor
doctors
.
Anybody
who
pleases
to
get
a
little
smattering
*NL*
of
medical
terms
is
not
now
at
liberty
to
practice
on
the
bodies
of
*NL*
citizens
,
as
in
your
day
.
None
but
students
who
have
passed
the
severe
*NL*
tests
of
the
schools
,
and
clearly
proved
their
vocation
,
are
permitted
*NL*
to
practice
.
Then
,
too
,
you
will
observe
that
there
is
nowadays
no
*NL*
attempt
of
doctors
to
build
up
their
practice
at
the
expense
of
other
*NL*
doctors
.
There
would
be
no
motive
for
that
.
For
the
rest
,
the
doctor
*NL*
has
to
render
regular
reports
of
his
work
to
the
medical
bureau

if
he

well
employed

CHAPTER
XII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
questions
which
I
needed
to
ask
before
I
could
acquire
even
an
*NL*
outline
acquaintance
with
the
institutions
of
the
twentieth
century
*NL*
being
endless
,
and
Dr.
Leete
's
good-nature
appearing
equally
so
,
we
*NL*
sat
up
talking
for
several
hours
after
the
ladies
left
us
.
Reminding
*NL*
my
host
of
the
point
at
which
our
talk
had
broken
off
that
morning
,
I
*NL*
expressed
my
curiosity
to
learn
how
the
organization
of
the
industrial
*NL*
army
was
made
to
afford
a
sufficient
stimulus
to
diligence
in
the
lack
*NL*
of
any
anxiety
on
the
worker
's
part
as
to
his
livelihood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
understand
in
the
first
place
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
that
*NL*
the
supply
of
incentives
to
effort
is
but
one
of
the
objects
sought
in
*NL*
the
organization
we
have
adopted
for
the
army
.
The
other
,
and
equally
*NL*
important
,
is
to
secure
for
the
file-leaders
and
captains
of
the
*NL*
force
,
and
the
great
officers
of
the
nation
,
men
of
proven
abilities
,
*NL*
who
are
pledged
by
their
own
careers
to
hold
their
followers
up
to
*NL*
their
highest
standard
of
performance
and
permit
no
lagging
.
With
a
*NL*
view
to
these
two
ends
the
industrial
army
is
organized
.
First
comes
*NL*
the
unclassified
grade
of
common
laborers
,
men
of
all
work
,
to
which
*NL*
all
recruits
during
their
first
three
years
belong
.
This
grade
is
a
*NL*
sort
of
school
,
and
a
very
strict
one
,
in
which
the
young
men
are
*NL*
taught
habits
of
obedience
,
subordination
,
and
devotion
to
duty
.
While
*NL*
the
miscellaneous
nature
of
the
work
done
by
this
force
prevents
the
*NL*
systematic
grading
of
the
workers
which
is
afterwards
possible
,
yet
*NL*
individual
records
are
kept
,
and
excellence
receives
distinction
*NL*
corresponding
with
the
penalties
that
negligence
incurs
.
It
is
not
,
*NL*
however
,
policy
with
us
to
permit
youthful
recklessness
or
*NL*
indiscretion
,
when
not
deeply
culpable
,
to
handicap
the
future
careers
*NL*
of
young
men
,
and
all
who
have
passed
through
the
unclassified
grade
*NL*
without
serious
disgrace
have
an
equal
opportunity
to
choose
the
life
*NL*
employment
they
have
most
liking
for
.
Having
selected
this
,
they
enter
*NL*
upon
it
as
apprentices
.
The
length
of
the
apprenticeship
naturally
*NL*
differs
in
different
occupations
.
At
the
end
of
it
the
apprentice
*NL*
becomes
a
full
workman
,
and
a
member
of
his
trade
or
guild
.
Now
not
*NL*
only
are
the
individual
records
of
the
apprentices
for
ability
and
*NL*
industry
strictly
kept
,
and
excellence
distinguished
by
suitable
*NL*
distinctions
,
but
upon
the
average
of
his
record
during
apprenticeship
*NL*
the
standing
given
the
apprentice
among
the
full
workmen
depends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
the
internal
organizations
of
different
industries
,
mechanical
*NL*
and
agricultural
,
differ
according
to
their
peculiar
conditions
,
they
*NL*
agree
in
a
general
division
of
their
workers
into
first
,
second
,
and
*NL*
third
grades
,
according
to
ability
,
and
these
grades
are
in
many
cases
*NL*
subdivided
into
first
and
second
classes
.
According
to
his
standing
as
*NL*
an
apprentice
a
young
man
is
assigned
his
place
as
a
first
,
second
,
or
*NL*
third
grade
worker
.
Of
course
only
young
men
of
unusual
ability
pass
*NL*
directly
from
apprenticeship
into
the
first
grade
of
the
workers
.
The
*NL*
most
fall
into
the
lower
grades
,
working
up
as
they
grow
more
*NL*
experienced
,
at
the
periodical
regradings
.
These
regradings
take
place
*NL*
in
each
industry
at
intervals
corresponding
with
the
length
of
the
*NL*
apprenticeship
to
that
industry
,
so
that
merit
never
need
wait
long
to
*NL*
rise
,
nor
can
any
rest
on
past
achievements
unless
they
would
drop
*NL*
into
a
lower
rank
.
One
of
the
notable
advantages
of
a
high
grading
is
*NL*
the
privilege
it
gives
the
worker
in
electing
which
of
the
various
*NL*
branches
or
processes
of
his
industry
he
will
follow
as
his
specialty
.
*NL*
Of
course
it
is
not
intended
that
any
of
these
processes
shall
be
*NL*
disproportionately
arduous
,
but
there
is
often
much
difference
between
*NL*
them
,
and
the
privilege
of
election
is
accordingly
highly
prized
.
So
*NL*
far
as
possible
,
indeed
,
the
preferences
even
of
the
poorest
workmen
*NL*
are
considered
in
assigning
them
their
line
of
work
,
because
not
only
*NL*
their
happiness
but
their
usefulness
is
thus
enhanced
.
While
,
however
,
*NL*
the
wish
of
the
lower
grade
man
is
consulted
so
far
as
the
exigencies
*NL*
of
the
service
permit
,
he
is
considered
only
after
the
upper
grade
men
*NL*
have
been
provided
for
,
and
often
he
has
to
put
up
with
second
or
*NL*
third
choice
,
or
even
with
an
arbitrary
assignment
when
help
is
*NL*
needed
.
This
privilege
of
election
attends
every
regrading
,
and
when
a
*NL*
man
loses
his
grade
he
also
risks
having
to
exchange
the
sort
of
work
*NL*
he
likes
for
some
other
less
to
his
taste
.
The
results
of
each
*NL*
regrading
,
giving
the
standing
of
every
man
in
his
industry
,
are
*NL*
gazetted
in
the
public
prints
,
and
those
who
have
won
promotion
since
*NL*
the
last
regrading
receive
the
nation
's
thanks
and
are
publicly
*NL*
invested
with
the
badge
of
their
new
rank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
may
this
badge
be
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
industry
has
its
emblematic
device
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
and
*NL*
this
,
in
the
shape
of
a
metallic
badge
so
small
that
you
might
not
see
*NL*
it
unless
you
knew
where
to
look
,
is
all
the
insignia
which
the
men
of
*NL*
the
army
wear
,
except
where
public
convenience
demands
a
distinctive
*NL*
uniform
.
This
badge
is
the
same
in
form
for
all
grades
of
industry
,
*NL*
but
while
the
badge
of
the
third
grade
is
iron
,
that
of
the
second
*NL*
grade
is
silver
,
and
that
of
the
first
is
gilt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apart
from
the
grand
incentive
to
endeavor
afforded
by
the
fact
that
*NL*
the
high
places
in
the
nation
are
open
only
to
the
highest
class
men
,
*NL*
and
that
rank
in
the
army
constitutes
the
only
mode
of
social
*NL*
distinction
for
the
vast
majority
who
are
not
aspirants
in
art
,
*NL*
literature
,
and
the
professions
,
various
incitements
of
a
minor
,
but
*NL*
perhaps
equally
effective
,
sort
are
provided
in
the
form
of
special
*NL*
privileges
and
immunities
in
the
way
of
discipline
,
which
the
superior
*NL*
class
men
enjoy
.
These
,
while
intended
to
be
as
little
as
possible
*NL*
invidious
to
the
less
successful
,
have
the
effect
of
keeping
*NL*
constantly
before
every
man
's
mind
the
great
desirability
of
attaining
*NL*
the
grade
next
above
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
obviously
important
that
not
only
the
good
but
also
the
*NL*
indifferent
and
poor
workmen
should
be
able
to
cherish
the
ambition
of
*NL*
rising
.
Indeed
,
the
number
of
the
latter
being
so
much
greater
,
it
is
*NL*
even
more
essential
that
the
ranking
system
should
not
operate
to
*NL*
discourage
them
than
that
it
should
stimulate
the
others
.
It
is
to
*NL*
this
end
that
the
grades
are
divided
into
classes
.
The
grades
as
well
*NL*
as
the
classes
being
made
numerically
equal
at
each
regrading
,
there
*NL*
is
not
at
any
time
,
counting
out
the
officers
and
the
unclassified
and
*NL*
apprentice
grades
,
over
one-ninth
of
the
industrial
army
in
the
lowest
*NL*
class
,
and
most
of
this
number
are
recent
apprentices
,
all
of
whom
*NL*
expect
to
rise
.
Those
who
remain
during
the
entire
term
of
service
in
*NL*
the
lowest
class
are
but
a
trifling
fraction
of
the
industrial
army
,
*NL*
and
likely
to
be
as
deficient
in
sensibility
to
their
position
as
in
*NL*
ability
to
better
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
even
necessary
that
a
worker
should
win
promotion
to
a
*NL*
higher
grade
to
have
at
least
a
taste
of
glory
.
While
promotion
*NL*
requires
a
general
excellence
of
record
as
a
worker
,
honorable
*NL*
mention
and
various
sorts
of
prizes
are
awarded
for
excellence
less
*NL*
than
sufficient
for
promotion
,
and
also
for
special
feats
and
single
*NL*
performances
in
the
various
industries
.
There
are
many
minor
*NL*
distinctions
of
standing
,
not
only
within
the
grades
but
within
the
*NL*
classes
,
each
of
which
acts
as
a
spur
to
the
efforts
of
a
group
.
It
is
*NL*
intended
that
no
form
of
merit
shall
wholly
fail
of
recognition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
actual
neglect
of
work
,
positively
bad
work
,
or
other
overt
*NL*
remissness
on
the
part
of
men
incapable
of
generous
motives
,
the
*NL*
discipline
of
the
industrial
army
is
far
too
strict
to
allow
anything
*NL*
whatever
of
the
sort
.
A
man
able
to
do
duty

and
persistently
*NL*
refusing

sentenced

solitary
imprisonment

``
The
lowest
grade
of
the
officers
of
the
industrial
army
,
that
of
*NL*
assistant
foremen
or
lieutenants
,
is
appointed
out
of
men
who
have
*NL*
held
their
place
for
two
years
in
the
first
class
of
the
first
grade
.
*NL*
Where
this
leaves
too
large
a
range
of
choice
,
only
the
first
group
of
*NL*
this
class
are
eligible
.
No
one
thus
comes
to
the
point
of
commanding
*NL*
men
until
he
is
about
thirty
years
old
.
After
a
man
becomes
an
*NL*
officer
,
his
rating
of
course
no
longer
depends
on
the
efficiency
of
*NL*
his
own
work
,
but
on
that
of
his
men
.
The
foremen
are
appointed
from
*NL*
among
the
assistant
foremen
,
by
the
same
exercise
of
discretion
*NL*
limited
to
a
small
eligible
class
.
In
the
appointments
to
the
still
*NL*
higher
grades
another
principle
is
introduced
,
which
it
would
take
*NL*
too
much
time
to
explain
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
such
a
system
of
grading
as
I
have
described
would
have
*NL*
been
impracticable
applied
to
the
small
industrial
concerns
of
your
*NL*
day
,
in
some
of
which
there
were
hardly
enough
employees
to
have
left
*NL*
one
apiece
for
the
classes
.
You
must
remember
that
,
under
the
national
*NL*
organization
of
labor
,
all
industries
are
carried
on
by
great
bodies
*NL*
of
men
,
many
of
your
farms
or
shops
being
combined
as
one
.
It
is
also
*NL*
owing
solely
to
the
vast
scale
on
which
each
industry
is
organized
,
*NL*
with
coordinate
establishments
in
every
part
of
the
country
,
that
we
*NL*
are
able
by
exchanges
and
transfers
to
fit
every
man
so
nearly
with
*NL*
the
sort
of
work
he
can
do
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
Mr.
West
,
I
will
leave
it
to
you
,
on
the
bare
outline
of
its
*NL*
features
which
I
have
given
,
if
those
who
need
special
incentives
to
*NL*
do
their
best
are
likely
to
lack
them
under
our
system
.
Does
it
not
*NL*
seem
to
you
that
men
who
found
themselves
obliged
,
whether
they
wished
*NL*
or
not
,
to
work
,
would
under
such
a
system
be
strongly
impelled
to
do
*NL*
their
best
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
that
it
seemed
to
me
the
incentives
offered
were
,
if
any
*NL*
objection
were
to
be
made
,
too
strong
;
that
the
pace
set
for
the
young
*NL*
men
was
too
hot
;
and
such
,
indeed
,
I
would
add
with
deference
,
still
*NL*
remains
my
opinion
,
now
that
by
longer
residence
among
you
I
have
*NL*
become
better
acquainted
with
the
whole
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
however
,
desired
me
to
reflect
,
and
I
am
ready
to
say
that
*NL*
it
is
perhaps
a
sufficient
reply
to
my
objection
,
that
the
worker
's
*NL*
livelihood
is
in
no
way
dependent
on
his
ranking
,
and
anxiety
for
that
*NL*
never
embitters
his
disappointments
;
that
the
working
hours
are
short
,
*NL*
the
vacations
regular
,
and
that
all
emulation
ceases
at
forty-five
,
*NL*
with
the
attainment
of
middle
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
two
or
three
other
points
I
ought
to
refer
to
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
``
to
prevent
your
getting
mistaken
impressions
.
In
the
first
place
,
you
*NL*
must
understand
that
this
system
of
preferment
given
the
more
*NL*
efficient
workers
over
the
less
so
,
in
no
way
contravenes
the
*NL*
fundamental
idea
of
our
social
system
,
that
all
who
do
their
best
are
*NL*
equally
deserving
,
whether
that
best
be
great
or
small
.
I
have
shown
*NL*
that
the
system
is
arranged
to
encourage
the
weaker
as
well
as
the
*NL*
stronger
with
the
hope
of
rising
,
while
the
fact
that
the
stronger
are
*NL*
selected
for
the
leaders
is
in
no
way
a
reflection
upon
the
weaker
,
*NL*
but
in
the
interest
of
the
common
weal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
imagine
,
either
,
because
emulation
is
given
free
play
as
an
*NL*
incentive
under
our
system
,
that
we
deem
it
a
motive
likely
to
appeal
*NL*
to
the
nobler
sort
of
men
,
or
worthy
of
them
.
Such
as
these
find
their
*NL*
motives
within
,
not
without
,
and
measure
their
duty
by
their
own
*NL*
endowments
,
not
by
those
of
others
.
So
long
as
their
achievement
is
*NL*
proportioned
to
their
powers
,
they
would
consider
it
preposterous
to
*NL*
expect
praise
or
blame
because
it
chanced
to
be
great
or
small
.
To
*NL*
such
natures
emulation
appears
philosophically
absurd
,
and
despicable
*NL*
in
a
moral
aspect
by
its
substitution
of
envy
for
admiration
,
and
*NL*
exultation
for
regret
,
in
one
's
attitude
toward
the
successes
and
the
*NL*
failures
of
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
all
men
,
even
in
the
last
year
of
the
twentieth
century
,
are
not
*NL*
of
this
high
order
,
and
the
incentives
to
endeavor
requisite
for
those
*NL*
who
are
not
must
be
of
a
sort
adapted
to
their
inferior
natures
.
For
*NL*
these
,
then
,
emulation
of
the
keenest
edge
is
provided
as
a
constant
*NL*
spur
.
Those
who
need
this
motive
will
feel
it
.
Those
who
are
above
its
*NL*
influence
do
not
need
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
fail
to
mention
,
''
resumed
the
doctor
,
``
that
for
those
*NL*
too
deficient
in
mental
or
bodily
strength
to
be
fairly
graded
with
*NL*
the
main
body
of
workers
,
we
have
a
separate
grade
,
unconnected
with
*NL*
the
others
,
--
a
sort
of
invalid
corps
,
the
members
of
which
are
*NL*
provided
with
a
light
class
of
tasks
fitted
to
their
strength
.
All
our
*NL*
sick
in
mind
and
body
,
all
our
deaf
and
dumb
,
and
lame
and
blind
and
*NL*
crippled
,
and
even
our
insane
,
belong
to
this
invalid
corps
,
and
bear
*NL*
its
insignia
.
The
strongest
often
do
nearly
a
man
's
work
,
the
*NL*
feeblest
,
of
course
,
nothing
;
but
none
who
can
do
anything
are
willing
*NL*
quite
to
give
up
.
In
their
lucid
intervals
,
even
our
insane
are
eager
*NL*
to
do
what
they
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
pretty
idea
of
the
invalid
corps
,
''
I
said
.
``
Even
a
*NL*
barbarian
from
the
nineteenth
century
can
appreciate
that
.
It
is
a
*NL*
very
graceful
way
of
disguising
charity
,
and
must
be
grateful
to
the
*NL*
feelings
of
its
recipients
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Charity
!
''
repeated
Dr.
Leete
.
``
Did
you
suppose
that
we
consider
the
*NL*
incapable
class
we
are
talking
of
objects
of
charity
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
naturally
,
''
I
said
,
``
inasmuch
as
they
are
incapable
of
*NL*
self-support
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
here
the
doctor
took
me
up
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
capable
of
self-support
?
''
he
demanded
.
``
There
is
no
such
thing
*NL*
in
a
civilized
society
as
self-support
.
In
a
state
of
society
so
*NL*
barbarous
as
not
even
to
know
family
cooperation
,
each
individual
may
*NL*
possibly
support
himself
,
though
even
then
for
a
part
of
his
life
*NL*
only
;
but
from
the
moment
that
men
begin
to
live
together
,
and
*NL*
constitute
even
the
rudest
sort
of
society
,
self-support
becomes
*NL*
impossible
.
As
men
grow
more
civilized
,
and
the
subdivision
of
*NL*
occupations
and
services
is
carried
out
,
a
complex
mutual
dependence
*NL*
becomes
the
universal
rule
.
Every
man
,
however
solitary
may
seem
his
*NL*
occupation
,
is
a
member
of
a
vast
industrial
partnership
,
as
large
as
*NL*
the
nation
,
as
large
as
humanity
.
The
necessity
of
mutual
dependence
*NL*
should
imply
the
duty
and
guarantee
of
mutual
support
;
and
that
it
did
*NL*
not
in
your
day
constituted
the
essential
cruelty
and
unreason
of
your
*NL*
system
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
all
be
so
,
''
I
replied
,
``
but
it
does
not
touch
the
case
of
*NL*
those
who
are
unable
to
contribute
anything
to
the
product
of
*NL*
industry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
I
told
you
this
morning
,
at
least
I
thought
I
did
,
''
replied
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
``
that
the
right
of
a
man
to
maintenance
at
the
nation
's
*NL*
table
depends
on
the
fact
that
he
is
a
man
,
and
not
on
the
amount
of
*NL*
health
and
strength
he
may
have
,
so
long
as
he
does
his
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
so
,
''
I
answered
,
``
but
I
supposed
the
rule
applied
only
to
*NL*
the
workers
of
different
ability
.
Does
it
also
hold
of
those
who
can
*NL*
do
nothing
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they
not
also
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
to
understand
,
then
,
that
the
lame
,
the
blind
,
the
sick
,
and
the
*NL*
impotent
,
are
as
well
off
as
the
most
efficient
,
and
have
the
same
*NL*
income
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
was
the
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
idea
of
charity
on
such
a
scale
,
''
I
answered
,
``
would
have
made
*NL*
our
most
enthusiastic
philanthropists
gasp
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
a
sick
brother
at
home
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
unable
to
*NL*
work
,
would
you
feed
him
on
less
dainty
food
,
and
lodge
and
clothe
him
*NL*
more
poorly
,
than
yourself
?
More
likely
far
,
you
would
give
him
the
*NL*
preference
;
nor
would
you
think
of
calling
it
charity
.
Would
not
the
*NL*
word
,
in
that
connection
,
fill
you
with
indignation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
I
replied
;
``
but
the
cases
are
not
parallel
.
There
is
a
*NL*
sense
,
no
doubt
,
in
which
all
men
are
brothers
;
but
this
general
sort
*NL*
of
brotherhood
is
not
to
be
compared
,
except
for
rhetorical
purposes
,
*NL*
to
the
brotherhood
of
blood
,
either
as
to
its
sentiment
or
its
*NL*
obligations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
speaks
the
nineteenth
century
!
''
exclaimed
Dr.
Leete
.
``
Ah
,
Mr.
*NL*
West
,
there
is
no
doubt
as
to
the
length
of
time
that
you
slept
.
If
I
*NL*
were
to
give
you
,
in
one
sentence
,
a
key
to
what
may
seem
the
*NL*
mysteries
of
our
civilization
as
compared
with
that
of
your
age
,
I
*NL*
should
say
that
it
is
the
fact
that
the
solidarity
of
the
race
and
the
*NL*
brotherhood
of
man
,
which
to
you
were
but
fine
phrases
,
are
,
to
our
*NL*
thinking
and
feeling
,
ties
as
real
and
as
vital
as
physical
*NL*
fraternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
even
setting
that
consideration
aside
,
I
do
not
see
why
it
so
*NL*
surprises
you
that
those
who
can
not
work
are
conceded
the
full
right
*NL*
to
live
on
the
produce
of
those
who
can
.
Even
in
your
day
,
the
duty
of
*NL*
military
service
for
the
protection
of
the
nation
,
to
which
our
*NL*
industrial
service
corresponds
,
while
obligatory
on
those
able
to
*NL*
discharge
it
,
did
not
operate
to
deprive
of
the
privileges
of
*NL*
citizenship
those
who
were
unable
.
They
stayed
at
home
,
and
were
*NL*
protected
by
those
who
fought
,
and
nobody
questioned
their
right
to
*NL*
be
,
or
thought
less
of
them
.
So
,
now
,
the
requirement
of
industrial
*NL*
service
from
those
able
to
render
it
does
not
operate
to
deprive
of
*NL*
the
privileges
of
citizenship
,
which
now
implies
the
citizen
's
*NL*
maintenance
,
him
who
can
not
work
.
The
worker
is
not
a
citizen
because
*NL*
he
works
,
but
works
because
he
is
a
citizen
.
As
you
recognize
the
duty
*NL*
of
the
strong
to
fight
for
the
weak
,
we
,
now
that
fighting
is
gone
by
,
*NL*
recognize
his
duty
to
work
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
solution
which
leaves
an
unaccounted-for
residuum
is
no
solution
at
*NL*
all
;
and
our
solution
of
the
problem
of
human
society
would
have
been
*NL*
none
at
all
had
it
left
the
lame
,
the
sick
,
and
the
blind
outside
with
*NL*
the
beasts
,
to
fare
as
they
might
.
Better
far
have
left
the
strong
and
*NL*
well
unprovided
for
than
these
burdened
ones
,
toward
whom
every
heart
*NL*
must
yearn
,
and
for
whom
ease
of
mind
and
body
should
be
provided
,
if
*NL*
for
no
others
.
Therefore
it
is
,
as
I
told
you
this
morning
,
that
the
*NL*
title
of
every
man
,
woman
,
and
child
to
the
means
of
existence
rests
*NL*
on
no
basis
less
plain
,
broad
,
and
simple
than
the
fact
that
they
are
*NL*
fellows
of
one
race
--
members
of
one
human
family
.
The
only
coin
*NL*
current
is
the
image
of
God
,
and
that
is
good
for
all
we
have
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
there
is
no
feature

civilization

your
epoch
so
*NL*
repugnant

modern

neglect
with
which
you
treated
your
*NL*
dependent
classes

had
no

no
feeling
of
brotherhood

*NL*
how
was
it
that
you
did
not
see

robbing

incapable

plain
right

unprovided

*NL*
*NL*
``

I
said

``
How
happened
it

was
Dr.

``
that
your

produce
more

What
did
you
do
with

Did
*NL*
you
not
rob
them

you
put
them
off
with
crusts
,
who
were
entitled
*NL*
to
sit

did
you
not
add

to

*NL*
called

*NL*
``
Ah
,
Mr.
West
,
''
Dr.
Leete
continued
,
as
I
did
not
respond
,
``
what
I
do
*NL*
not
understand
is
,
setting
aside
all
considerations
either
of
justice
*NL*
or
brotherly
feeling
toward
the
crippled
and
defective
,
how
the
*NL*
workers
of
your
day
could
have
had
any
heart
for
their
work
,
knowing
*NL*
that
their
children
,
or
grand-children
,
if
unfortunate
,
would
be
*NL*
deprived
of
the
comforts
and
even
necessities
of
life
.
It
is
a
mystery
*NL*
how
men
with
children
could
favor
a
system
under
which
they
were
*NL*
rewarded
beyond
those
less
endowed
with
bodily
strength

mental
*NL*
power

For

by
the

discrimination
by
which
the

the

for
whom
he
would
give
his
life
,
being
perchance
weaker
than
*NL*
others
,
might
be
reduced
to
crusts
and
beggary

How
men
dared
leave
*NL*
children
behind
them

I
have
never
been
able
to

NOTE
.
--
Although
in
his
talk
on
the
previous
evening
Dr.
Leete
*NL*
had
emphasized
the
pains
taken
to
enable
every
man
to
*NL*
ascertain
and
follow
his
natural
bent
in
choosing
an
*NL*
occupation
,
it
was
not
till
I
learned
that
the
worker
's
*NL*
income
is
the
same
in
all
occupations
that
I
realized
how
*NL*
absolutely
he
may
be
counted
on
to
do
so
,
and
thus
,
by
*NL*
selecting
the
harness
which
sets
most
lightly
on
himself
,
*NL*
find
that
in
which
he
can
pull
best
.
The
failure
of
my
age
in
*NL*
any
systematic
or
effective
way
to
develop
and
utilize
the
*NL*
natural
aptitudes
of
men
for
the
industries
and
intellectual
*NL*
avocations
was
one
of
the
great
wastes
,
as
well
as
one
of
the
*NL*
most
common
causes
of
unhappiness
in
that
time
.
The
vast
*NL*
majority
of
my
contemporaries
,
though
nominally
free
to
do
*NL*
so
,
never
really
chose
their
occupations
at
all
,
but
were
*NL*
forced
by
circumstances
into
work
for
which
they
were
*NL*
relatively
inefficient
,
because
not
naturally
fitted
for
it
.
*NL*
The
rich
,
in
this
respect
,
had
little
advantage
over
the
*NL*
poor
.
The
latter
,
indeed
,
being
generally
deprived
of
*NL*
education
,
had
no
opportunity
even
to
ascertain
the
natural
*NL*
aptitudes
they
might
have
,
and
on
account
of
their
poverty
*NL*
were
unable
to
develop
them
by
cultivation
even
when
*NL*
ascertained
.
The
liberal
and
technical
professions
,
except
by
*NL*
favorable
accident
,
were
shut
to
them
,
to
their
own
great
*NL*
loss
and
that
of
the
nation
.
On
the
other
hand
,
the
*NL*
well-to-do
,
although
they
could
command
education
and
*NL*
opportunity
,
were
scarcely
less
hampered
by
social
prejudice
,
*NL*
which
forbade
them
to
pursue
manual
avocations
,
even
when
*NL*
adapted
to
them
,
and
destined
them
,
whether
fit
or
unfit
,
to
*NL*
the
professions
,
thus
wasting
many
an
excellent
*NL*
handicraftsman
.
Mercenary
considerations
,
tempting
men
to
*NL*
pursue
money-making
occupations
for
which
they
were
unfit
,
*NL*
instead
of
less
remunerative
employments
for
which
they
were
*NL*
fit
,
were
responsible
for
another
vast
perversion
of
talent
.
*NL*
All
these
things
now
are
changed
.
Equal
education
and
*NL*
opportunity
must
needs
bring
to
light
whatever
aptitudes
a
*NL*
man
has
,
and
neither
social
prejudices
nor
mercenary
*NL*
considerations
hamper
him
in
the
choice
of
his
life
work
.

CHAPTER
XIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
Edith
had
promised
he
should
do
,
Dr.
Leete
accompanied
me
to
my
*NL*
bedroom
when
I
retired
,
to
instruct
me
as
to
the
adjustment
of
the
*NL*
musical
telephone
.
He
showed
how
,
by
turning
a
screw
,
the
volume
of
*NL*
the
music
could
be
made
to
fill
the
room
,
or
die
away
to
an
echo
so
*NL*
faint
and
far
that
one
could
scarcely
be
sure
whether
he
heard
or
*NL*
imagined
it
.
If
,
of
two
persons
side
by
side
,
one
desired
to
listen
to
*NL*
music
and
the
other
to
sleep
,
it
could
be
made
audible
to
one
and
*NL*
inaudible
to
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
strongly
advise
you
to
sleep
if
you
can
to-night
,
Mr.
West
,
*NL*
in
preference
to
listening
to
the
finest
tunes
in
the
world
,
''
the
*NL*
doctor
said
,
after
explaining
these
points
.
``
In
the
trying
experience
*NL*
you
are
just
now
passing
through
,
sleep
is
a
nerve
tonic
for
which
*NL*
there
is
no
substitute
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mindful
of
what
had
happened
to
me
that
very
morning
,
I
promised
to
*NL*
heed
his
counsel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
he
said
,
``
then
I
will
set
the
telephone
at
eight
*NL*
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
explained
that
,
by
a
clock-work
combination
,
a
person
could
arrange
*NL*
to
be
awakened
at
any
hour
by
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
began
to
appear
,
as
has
since
fully
proved
to
be
the
case
,
that
I
*NL*
had
left
my
tendency
to
insomnia
behind
me
with
the
other
discomforts
*NL*
of
existence
in
the
nineteenth
century
;
for
though
I
took
no
sleeping
*NL*
draught
this
time
,
yet
,
as
the
night
before
,
I
had
no
sooner
touched
*NL*
the
pillow
than
I
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
dreamed
that
I
sat
on
the
throne
of
the
Abencerrages
in
the
*NL*
banqueting
hall
of
the
Alhambra
,
feasting
my
lords
and
generals
,
who
*NL*
next
day
were
to
follow
the
crescent
against
the
Christian
dogs
of
*NL*
Spain
.
The
air
,
cooled
by
the
spray
of
fountains
,
was
heavy
with
the
*NL*
scent
of
flowers
.
A
band
of
Nautch
girls
,
round-limbed
and
*NL*
luscious-lipped
,
danced
with
voluptuous
grace
to
the
music
of
brazen
*NL*
and
stringed
instruments
.
Looking
up
to
the
latticed
galleries
,
one
*NL*
caught
a
gleam
now
and
then
from
the
eye
of
some
beauty
of
the
royal
*NL*
harem
,
looking
down
upon
the
assembled
flower
of
Moorish
chivalry
.
*NL*
Louder
and
louder
clashed
the
cymbals
,
wilder
and
wilder
grew
the
*NL*
strain
,
till
the
blood
of
the
desert
race
could
no
longer
resist
the
*NL*
martial
delirium
,
and
the
swart
nobles
leaped
to
their
feet
;
a
*NL*
thousand
scimitars
were
bared
,
and
the
cry
,
``
Allah
il
Allah
!
''
shook
*NL*
the
hall
and
awoke
me
,
to
find
it
broad
daylight
,
and
the
room
*NL*
tingling
with
the
electric
music
of
the
``
Turkish
Reveille
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
breakfast-table
,
when
I
told
my
host
of
my
morning
's
*NL*
experience
,
I
learned
that
it
was
not
a
mere
chance
that
the
piece
of
*NL*
music
which
awakened
me
was
a
reveille
.
The
airs
played
at
one
of
the
*NL*
halls
during
the
waking
hours
of
the
morning
were
always
of
an
*NL*
inspiring
type
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
have
not
thought
to
ask
you
anything
about
*NL*
the
state
of
Europe
.
Have
the
societies
of
the
Old
World
also
been
*NL*
remodeled
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
the
great
nations
of
Europe
as
well
as
*NL*
Australia
,
Mexico
,
and
parts
of
South
America
,
are
now
organized
*NL*
industrially
like
the
United
States
,
which
was
the
pioneer
of
the
*NL*
evolution
.
The
peaceful
relations
of
these
nations
are
assured
by
a
*NL*
loose
form
of
federal
union
of
world-wide
extent
.
An
international
*NL*
council
regulates
the
mutual
intercourse
and
commerce
of
the
members
*NL*
of
the
union
and
their
joint
policy
toward
the
more
backward
races
,
*NL*
which
are
gradually
being
educated
up
to
civilized
institutions
.
*NL*
Complete
autonomy
within
its
own
limits
is
enjoyed
by
every
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
carry
on
commerce
without
money
?
''
I
said
.
``
In
trading
with
*NL*
other
nations
,
you
must
use
some
sort
of
money
,
although
you
dispense
*NL*
with
it
in
the
internal
affairs
of
the
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
;
money
is
as
superfluous
in
our
foreign
as
in
our
internal
*NL*
relations
.
When
foreign
commerce
was
conducted
by
private
enterprise
,
*NL*
money
was
necessary
to
adjust
it
on
account
of
the
multifarious
*NL*
complexity
of
the
transactions
;
but
nowadays
it
is
a
function
of
the
*NL*
nations
as
units
.
There
are
thus
only
a
dozen
or
so
merchants
in
the
*NL*
world
,
and
their
business
being
supervised
by
the
international
*NL*
council
,
a
simple
system
of
book
accounts
serves
perfectly
to
regulate
*NL*
their
dealings
.
Customs
duties
of
every
sort
are
of
course
*NL*
superfluous
.
A
nation
simply
does
not
import
what
its
government
does
*NL*
not
think
requisite
for
the
general
interest
.
Each
nation
has
a
bureau
*NL*
of
foreign
exchange
,
which
manages
its
trading
.
For
example
,
the
*NL*
American
bureau
,
estimating
such
and
such
quantities
of
French
goods
*NL*
necessary
to
America
for
a
given
year
,
sends
the
order
to
the
French
*NL*
bureau
,
which
in
turn
sends
its
order
to
our
bureau
.
The
same
is
done
*NL*
mutually
by
all
the
nations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
are
the
prices
of
foreign
goods
settled
,
since
there
is
no
*NL*
competition
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
price
at
which
one
nation
supplies
another
with
goods
,
''
replied
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
``
must
be
that
at
which
it
supplies
its
own
citizens
.
So
you
*NL*
see
there
is
no
danger
of
misunderstanding
.
Of
course
no
nation
is
*NL*
theoretically
bound
to
supply
another
with
the
product
of
its
own
*NL*
labor
,
but
it
is
for
the
interest
of
all
to
exchange
some
commodities
.
*NL*
If
a
nation
is
regularly
supplying
another
with
certain
goods
,
notice
*NL*
is
required
from
either
side
of
any
important
change
in
the
relation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
if
a
nation
,
having
a
monopoly
of
some
natural
product
,
*NL*
should
refuse
to
supply
it
to
the
others
,
or
to
one
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
a
case
has
never
occurred
,
and
could
not
without
doing
the
*NL*
refusing
party
vastly
more
harm
than
the
others
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
*NL*
``
In
the
first
place
,
no
favoritism
could
be
legally
shown
.
The
law
*NL*
requires
that
each
nation
shall
deal
with
the
others
,
in
all
respects
,
*NL*
on
exactly
the
same
footing
.
Such
a
course
as
you
suggest
would
cut
*NL*
off
the
nation
adopting
it
from
the
remainder
of
the
earth
for
all
*NL*
purposes
whatever
.
The
contingency
is
one
that
need
not
give
us
much
*NL*
anxiety
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
I
,
``
supposing
a
nation
,
having
a
natural
monopoly
in
some
*NL*
product
of
which
it
exports
more
than
it
consumes
,
should
put
the
*NL*
price
away
up
,
and
thus
,
without
cutting
off
the
supply
,
make
a
profit
*NL*
out
of
its
neighbors
'
necessities
?
Its
own
citizens
would
of
course
*NL*
have
to
pay
the
higher
price
on
that
commodity
,
but
as
a
body
would
*NL*
make
more
out
of
foreigners
than
they
would
be
out
of
pocket
*NL*
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
you
come
to
know
how
prices
of
all
commodities
are
determined
*NL*
nowadays
,
you
will
perceive
how
impossible
it
is
that
they
could
be
*NL*
altered
,
except
with
reference
to
the
amount
or
arduousness
of
the
*NL*
work
required
respectively
to
produce
them
,
''
was
Dr.
Leete
's
reply
.
*NL*
``
This
principle
is
an
international
as
well
as
a
national
guarantee
;
*NL*
but
even
without
it
the
sense
of
community
of
interest
,
international
*NL*
as
well
as
national
,
and
the
conviction
of
the
folly
of
selfishness
,
*NL*
are
too
deep
nowadays
to
render
possible
such
a
piece
of
sharp
*NL*
practice
as
you
apprehend
.
You
must
understand
that
we
all
look
*NL*
forward
to
an
eventual
unification
of
the
world
as
one
nation
.
That
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
will
be
the
ultimate
form
of
society
,
and
will
realize
*NL*
certain
economic
advantages
over
the
present
federal
system
of
*NL*
autonomous
nations
.
Meanwhile
,
however
,
the
present
system
works
so
*NL*
nearly
perfectly
that
we
are
quite
content
to
leave
to
posterity
the
*NL*
completion
of
the
scheme
.
There
are
,
indeed
,
some
who
hold
that
it
*NL*
never
will
be
completed
,
on
the
ground
that
the
federal
plan
is
not
*NL*
merely
a
provisional
solution
of
the
problem
of
human
society
,
but
the
*NL*
best
ultimate
solution
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
manage
,
''
I
asked
,
``
when
the
books
of
any
two
nations
do
*NL*
not
balance
?
Supposing
we
import
more
from
France
than
we
export
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
the
end
of
each
year
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
``
the
books
of
every
*NL*
nation
are
examined
.
If
France
is
found
in
our
debt
,
probably
we
are
*NL*
in
the
debt
of
some
nation
which
owes
France
,
and
so
on
with
all
the
*NL*
nations
.
The
balances
that
remain
after
the
accounts
have
been
cleared
*NL*
by
the
international
council
should
not
be
large
under
our
system
.
*NL*
Whatever
they
may
be
,
the
council
requires
them
to
be
settled
every
*NL*
few
years
,
and
may
require
their
settlement
at
any
time
if
they
are
*NL*
getting
too
large
;
for
it
is
not
intended
that
any
nation
shall
run
*NL*
largely
in
debt
to
another
,
lest
feelings
unfavorable
to
amity
should
*NL*
be
engendered
.
To
guard
further
against
this
,
the
international
*NL*
council
inspects
the
commodities
interchanged
by
the
nations
,
to
see
*NL*
that
they
are
of
perfect
quality

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
are
the
balances
finally
settled
with
,
seeing
that
you
have
*NL*
no
money

*NL*
*NL*
``
In
national
staples
;
a
basis
of
agreement

in
what
proportions
,
for
settlement
of
accounts
,
being
a
*NL*
preliminary
to
trade
relations
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Emigration
is
another
point
I
want
to
ask
you
about
,
''
said
I.
``
With
*NL*
every
nation
organized
as
a
close
industrial
partnership
,
monopolizing
*NL*
all
means
of
production
in
the
country
,
the
emigrant
,
even
if
he
were
*NL*
permitted
to
land
,
would
starve
.
I
suppose
there
is
no
emigration
*NL*
nowadays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
there
is
constant
emigration
,
by
which
I
suppose
you
*NL*
mean
removal
to
foreign
countries
for
permanent
residence
,
''
replied
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
.
``
It
is
arranged
on
a
simple
international
arrangement
of
*NL*
indemnities
.
For
example
,
if
a
man
at
twenty-one
emigrates
from
*NL*
England
to
America
,
England
loses
all
the
expense
of
his
maintenance
*NL*
and
education
,
and
America
gets
a
workman
for
nothing
.
America
*NL*
accordingly
makes
England
an
allowance
.
The
same
principle
,
varied
to
*NL*
suit
the
case
,
applies
generally
.
If
the
man
is
near
the
term
of
his
*NL*
labor
when
he
emigrates
,
the
country
receiving
him
has
the
allowance
.
*NL*
As
to
imbecile
persons
,
it
is
deemed
best
that
each
nation
should
be
*NL*
responsible
for
its
own
,
and
the
emigration
of
such
must
be
under
*NL*
full
guarantees
of
support
by
his
own
nation
.
Subject
to
these
*NL*
regulations
,
the
right
of
any
man
to
emigrate
at
any
time
is
*NL*
unrestricted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
about
mere
pleasure
trips
;
tours
of
observation
?
How
can
a
*NL*
stranger
travel
in
a
country
whose
people
do
not
receive
money
,
and
*NL*
are
themselves
supplied
with
the
means
of
life
on
a
basis
not
extended
*NL*
to
him
?
His
own
credit
card
can
not
,
of
course
,
be
good
in
other
lands
.
*NL*
How
does
he
pay
his
way
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
American
credit
card
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
is
just
as
good
in
*NL*
Europe
as
American
gold
used
to
be
,
and
on
precisely
the
same
*NL*
condition
,
namely
,
that
it
be
exchanged
into
the
currency
of
the
*NL*
country
you
are
traveling
in
.
An
American
in
Berlin
takes
his
credit
*NL*
card
to
the
local
office
of
the
international
council
,
and
receives
in
*NL*
exchange
for
the
whole
or
part
of
it
a
German
credit
card
,
the
amount
*NL*
being
charged
against
the
United
States
in
favor
of
Germany
on
the
*NL*
international
account
.

``
Perhaps
Mr.
West
would
like
to
dine
at
the
Elephant
to-day
,
''
said
*NL*
Edith
,
as
we
left
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
name
we
give
to
the
general
dining-house
of
our
ward
,
''
*NL*
explained
her
father
.
``
Not
only
is
our
cooking
done
at
the
public
*NL*
kitchens
,
as
I
told
you
last
night
,
but
the
service
and
quality
of
the
*NL*
meals
are
much
more
satisfactory
if
taken
at
the
dining-house
.
The
*NL*
two
minor
meals
of
the
day
are
usually
taken
at
home
,
as
not
worth
the
*NL*
trouble
of
going
out
;
but
it
is
general
to
go
out
to
dine
.
We
have
not
*NL*
done
so
since
you
have
been
with
us
,
from
a
notion
that
it
would
be
*NL*
better
to
wait
till
you
had
become
a
little
more
familiar
with
our
*NL*
ways
.
What
do
you
think
?
Shall
we
take
dinner
at
the
dining-house
*NL*
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
said
that
I
should
be
very
much
pleased
to
do
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
long
after
,
Edith
came
to
me
,
smiling
,
and
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Last
night
,
as
I
was
thinking
what
I
could
do
to
make
you
feel
at
*NL*
home
until
you
came
to
be
a
little
more
used
to
us
and
our
ways
,
an
*NL*
idea
occurred
to
me
.
What
would
you
say
if
I
were
to
introduce
you
to
*NL*
some
very
nice
people
of
your
own
times
,
whom
I
am
sure
you
used
to
be
*NL*
well
acquainted
with
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
replied
,
rather
vaguely
,
that
it
would
certainly
be
very
agreeable
,
*NL*
but
I
did
not
see
how
she
was
going
to
manage
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
with
me
,
''
was
her
smiling
reply
,
``
and
see
if
I
am
not
as
good
as
*NL*
my
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
susceptibility
to
surprise
had
been
pretty
well
exhausted
by
the
*NL*
numerous
shocks
it
had
received
,
but
it
was
with
some
wonderment
that
*NL*
I
followed
her
into
a
room
which
I
had
not
before
entered
.
It
was
a
*NL*
small
,
cosy
apartment
,
walled
with
cases
filled
with
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
are
your
friends
,
''
said
Edith
,
indicating
one
of
the
cases
,
and
*NL*
as
my
eye
glanced
over
the
names
on
the
backs
of
the
volumes
,
*NL*
Shakespeare
,
Milton
,
Wordsworth
,
Shelley
,
Tennyson
,
Defoe
,
Dickens
,
*NL*
Thackeray
,
Hugo
,
Hawthorne
,
Irving
,
and
a
score
of
other
great
writers
*NL*
of
my
time
and
all
time
,
I
understood
her
meaning
.
She
had
indeed
made
*NL*
good
her
promise
in
a
sense
compared
with
which
its
literal
*NL*
fulfillment
would
have
been
a
disappointment
.
She
had
introduced
me
to
*NL*
a
circle
of
friends
whom
the
century
that
had
elapsed
since
last
I
*NL*
communed
with
them
had
aged
as
little
as
it
had
myself
.
Their
spirit
*NL*
was
as
high
,
their
wit
as
keen
,
their
laughter
and
their
tears
as
*NL*
contagious
,
as
when
their
speech
had
whiled
away
the
hours
of
a
former
*NL*
century
.
Lonely
I
was
not
and
could
not
be
more
,
with
this
goodly
*NL*
companionship
,
however
wide
the
gulf
of
years
that
gaped
between
me
*NL*
and
my
old
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
glad
I
brought
you
here
,
''
exclaimed
Edith
,
radiant
,
as
she
*NL*
read
in
my
face
the
success
of
her
experiment
.
``
It
was
a
good
idea
,
*NL*
was
it
not
,
Mr.
West
?
How
stupid
in
me
not
to
think
of
it
before
!
I
*NL*
will
leave
you
now
with
your
old
friends
,
for
I
know
there
will
be
no
*NL*
company
for
you
like
them
just
now
;
but
remember
you
must
not
let
old
*NL*
friends
make
you
quite
forget
new
ones
!
''
and
with
that
smiling
caution
*NL*
she
left
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
Attracted
by
the
most
familiar
of
the
names
before
me
,
I
laid
my
hand
*NL*
on
a
volume
of
Dickens
,
and
sat
down
to
read
.
He
had
been
my
prime
*NL*
favorite
among
the
book-writers
of
the
century
,
--
I
mean
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
--
and
a
week
had
rarely
passed
in
my
old
life
during
which
I
*NL*
had
not
taken
up
some
volume
of
his
works
to
while
away
an
idle
hour
.
*NL*
Any
volume
with
which
I
had
been
familiar
would
have
produced
an
*NL*
extraordinary
impression
,
read
under
my
present
circumstances
,
but
my
*NL*
exceptional
familiarity
with
Dickens
,
and
his
consequent
power
to
call
*NL*
up
the
associations
of
my
former
life
,
gave
to
his
writings
an
effect
*NL*
no
others
could
have
had
,
to
intensify
,
by
force
of
contrast
,
my
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
strangeness
of
my
present
environment
.
However
new
*NL*
and
astonishing
one
's
surroundings
,
the
tendency
is
to
become
a
part
*NL*
of
them
so
soon
that
almost
from
the
first
the
power
to
see
them
*NL*
objectively
and
fully
measure
their
strangeness
,
is
lost
.
That
power
,
*NL*
already
dulled
in
my
case
,
the
pages
of
Dickens
restored
by
carrying
*NL*
me
back
through
their
associations
to
the
standpoint
of
my
former
*NL*
life
.
With
a
clearness
which
I
had
not
been
able
before
to
attain
,
I
*NL*
saw
now
the
past
and
present
,
like
contrasting
pictures
,
side
by
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
genius
of
the
great
novelist
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
like
that
*NL*
of
Homer
,
might
indeed
defy
time
;
but
the
setting
of
his
pathetic
*NL*
tales
,
the
misery
of
the
poor
,
the
wrongs
of
power
,
the
pitiless
*NL*
cruelty
of
the
system
of
society
,
had
passed
away
as
utterly
as
Circe
*NL*
and
the
sirens
,
Charybdis
and
Cyclops
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
hour
or
two
that
I
sat
there
with
Dickens
open
before
me
,
I
*NL*
did
not
actually
read
more
than
a
couple
of
pages
.
Every
paragraph
,
*NL*
every
phrase
,
brought
up
some
new
aspect
of
the
world-transformation
*NL*
which
had
taken
place
,
and
led
my
thoughts
on
long
and
widely
*NL*
ramifying
excursions
.
As
meditating
thus
in
Dr.
Leete
's
library
I
*NL*
gradually
attained
a
more
clear
and
coherent
idea
of
the
prodigious
*NL*
spectacle
which
I
had
been
so
strangely
enabled
to
view
,
I
was
filled
*NL*
with
a
deepening
wonder
at
the
seeming
capriciousness
of
the
fate
that
*NL*
had
given
to
one
who
so
little
deserved
it
,
or
seemed
in
any
way
set
*NL*
apart
for
it
,
the
power
alone
among
his
contemporaries
to
stand
upon
*NL*
the
earth
in
this
latter
day
.
I
had
neither
foreseen
the
new
world
nor
*NL*
toiled
for
it
,
as
many
about
me
had
done
regardless
of
the
scorn
of
*NL*
fools
or
the
misconstruction
of
the
good
.
Surely
it
would
have
been
*NL*
more
in
accordance
with
the
fitness
of
things
had
one
of
those
*NL*
prophetic
and
strenuous
souls
been
enabled
to
see
the
travail
of
his
*NL*
soul
and
be
satisfied
;
he
,
for
example
,
a
thousand
times
rather
than
*NL*
I
,
who
,
having
beheld
in
a
vision
the
world
I
looked
on
,
sang
of
it
in
*NL*
words
that
again
and
again
,
during
these
last
wondrous
days
,
had
rung
*NL*
in
my
mind
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
dipt
into
the
future
,
far
as
human
eye
could
see
.
*NL*
Saw
the
vision
of
the
world
,
and
all
the
wonder
that
would
be
;
*NL*
*NL*
Till
the
war-drum
throbbed
no
longer
,
and
the
battle-flags
were
furled
.
*NL*
In
the
Parliament
of
man
,
the
federation
of
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
common
sense
of
most
shall
hold
a
fretful
realm
in
awe
,
*NL*
And
the
kindly
earth
shall
slumber
,
lapt
in
universal
law
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
I
doubt
not
through
the
ages
one
increasing
purpose
runs
,
*NL*
And
the
thoughts
of
men
are
widened
with
the
process
of
the
suns
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
What
though
,
in
his
old
age
,
he
momentarily
lost
faith
in
his
own
*NL*
prediction
,
as
prophets
in
their
hours
of
depression
and
doubt
*NL*
generally
do
;
the
words
had
remained
eternal
testimony
to
the
seership
*NL*
of
a
poet
's
heart
,
the
insight
that
is
given
to
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
still
in
the
library
when
some
hours
later
Dr.
Leete
sought
me
*NL*
there
.
``
Edith
told
me
of
her
idea
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
thought
it
an
*NL*
excellent
one
.
I
had
a
little
curiosity
what
writer
you
would
first
*NL*
turn
to
.
Ah
,
Dickens
!
You
admired
him
,
then
!
That
is
where
we
moderns
*NL*
agree
with
you
.
Judged
by
our
standards
,
he
overtops
all
the
writers
*NL*
of
his
age
,
not
because
his
literary
genius
was
highest
,
but
because
*NL*
his
great
heart
beat
for
the
poor
,
because
he
made
the
cause
of
the
*NL*
victims
of
society
his
own
,
and
devoted
his
pen
to
exposing
its
*NL*
cruelties
and
shams
.
No
man
of
his
time
did
so
much
as
he
to
turn
*NL*
men
's
minds
to
the
wrong
and
wretchedness
of
the
old
order
of
things
,
*NL*
and
open
their
eyes
to
the
necessity
of
the
great
change
that
was
*NL*
coming
,
although
he
himself
did
not
clearly
foresee
it
.

CHAPTER
XIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
heavy
rainstorm
came
up
during
the
day
,
and
I
had
concluded
that
the
*NL*
condition
of
the
streets
would
be
such
that
my
hosts
would
have
to
*NL*
give
up
the
idea
of
going
out
to
dinner
,
although
the
dining-hall
I
*NL*
had
understood
to
be
quite
near
.
I
was
much
surprised
when
at
the
*NL*
dinner
hour
the
ladies
appeared
prepared
to
go
out
,
but
without
either
*NL*
rubbers
or
umbrellas
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mystery
was
explained
when
we
found
ourselves
on
the
street
,
for
a
*NL*
continuous
waterproof
covering
had
been
let
down
so
as
to
inclose
the
*NL*
sidewalk
and
turn
it
into
a
well
lighted
and
perfectly
dry
corridor
,
*NL*
which
was
filled
with
a
stream
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
dressed
for
*NL*
dinner
.
At
the
corners
the
entire
open
space
was
similarly
roofed
in
.
*NL*
Edith
Leete
,
with
whom
I
walked
,
seemed
much
interested
in
learning
*NL*
what
appeared
to
be
entirely
new
to
her
,
that
in
the
stormy
weather
*NL*
the
streets
of
the
Boston
of
my
day
had
been
impassable
,
except
to
*NL*
persons
protected
by
umbrellas
,
boots
,
and
heavy
clothing
.
``
Were
*NL*
sidewalk
coverings
not
used
at
all
?
''
she
asked
.
They
were
used
,
I
*NL*
explained
,
but
in
a
scattered
and
utterly
unsystematic
way
,
being
*NL*
private
enterprises
.
She
said
to
me
that
at
the
present
time
all
the
*NL*
streets
were
provided
against
inclement
weather
in
the
manner
I
saw
,
*NL*
the
apparatus
being
rolled
out
of
the
way
when
it
was
unnecessary
.
She
*NL*
intimated
that
it
would
be
considered
an
extraordinary
imbecility
to
*NL*
permit
the
weather
to
have
any
effect
on
the
social
movements
of
the
*NL*
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
who
was
walking
ahead
,
overhearing
something
of
our
talk
,
*NL*
turned
to
say
that
the
difference
between
the
age
of
individualism
and
*NL*
that
of
concert
was
well
characterized
by
the
fact
that
,
in
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
,
when
it
rained
,
the
people
of
Boston
put
up
three
*NL*
hundred
thousand
umbrellas
over
as
many
heads
,
and
in
the
twentieth
*NL*
century
they
put
up
one
umbrella
over
all
the
heads
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
walked
on
,

The
private
umbrella
is
father
's
*NL*
favorite
figure
to
illustrate
the
old
way
when
everybody
lived
for
*NL*
himself
and
his
family
.
There
is
a
nineteenth
century
painting
at
the
*NL*
Art
Gallery
representing
a
crowd
of
people
in
the
rain
,
each
one
*NL*
holding
his
umbrella
over
himself
and
his
wife
,
and
giving
his
*NL*
neighbors
the
drippings
,
which
he
claims
must
have
been
meant
by
the
*NL*
artist
as
a
satire
on
his
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
entered
a
large
building
into
which
a
stream
of
people
was
*NL*
pouring
.
I
could
not
see
the
front
,
owing
to
the
awning
,
but
,
if
in
*NL*
correspondence
with
the
interior
,
which
was
even
finer
than
the
store
*NL*
I
visited
the
day
before
,
it
would
have
been
magnificent
.
My
companion
*NL*
said
that
the
sculptured
group
over
the
entrance
was
especially
*NL*
admired
.
Going
up
a
grand
staircase
we
walked
some
distance
along
a
*NL*
broad
corridor
with
many
doors
opening
upon
it
.
At
one
of
these
,
which
*NL*
bore
my
host
's
name
,
we
turned
in
,
and
I
found
myself
in
an
elegant
*NL*
dining-room
containing
a
table
for
four
.
Windows
opened
on
a
courtyard
*NL*
where
a
fountain
played
to
a
great
height
and
music
made
the
air
*NL*
electric
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
at
home
here
,
''
I
said
,
as
we
seated
ourselves
at
table
,
and
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
touched
an
annunciator
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
,
in
fact
,
a
part
of
our
house
,
slightly
detached
from
the
*NL*
rest
,
''
he
replied
.
``
Every
family
in
the
ward
has
a
room
set
apart
in
*NL*
this
great
building
for
its
permanent
and
exclusive
use
for
a
small
*NL*
annual
rental
.
For
transient
guests
and
individuals
there
is
*NL*
accommodation
on
another
floor
.
If
we
expect
to
dine
here
,
we
put
in
*NL*
our
orders
the
night
before
,
selecting
anything
in
market
,
according
*NL*
to
the
daily
reports
in
the
papers
.
The
meal
is
as
expensive
or
as
*NL*
simple
as
we
please
,
though
of
course
everything
is
vastly
cheaper
as
*NL*
well
as
better
than
it
would
be
if
prepared
at
home
.
There
is
actually
*NL*
nothing
which
our
people
take
more
interest
in
than
the
perfection
of
*NL*
the
catering
and
cooking
done
for
them
,
and
I
admit
that
we
are
a
*NL*
little
vain
of
the
success
that
has
been
attained
by
this
branch
of
*NL*
the
service
.
Ah
,
my
dear
Mr.
West
,
though
other
aspects
of
your
*NL*
civilization
were
more
tragical
,
I
can
imagine
that
none
could
have
*NL*
been
more
depressing
than
the
poor
dinners
you
had
to
eat
,
that
is
,
*NL*
all
of
you
who
had
not
great
wealth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
have
found
none
of
us
disposed
to
disagree
with
you
on
that
*NL*
point
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
,
a
fine-looking
young
fellow
,
wearing
a
slightly
*NL*
distinctive
uniform
,
now
made
his
appearance
.
I
observed
him
closely
,
*NL*
as
it
was
the
first
time
I
had
been
able
to
study
particularly
the
*NL*
bearing
of
one
of
the
enlisted
members
of
the
industrial
army
.
This
*NL*
young
man
,
I
knew
from
what
I
had
been
told
,
must
be
highly
educated
,
*NL*
and
the
equal
,
socially
and
in
all
respects
,
of
those
he
served
.
But
*NL*
it
was
perfectly
evident
that
to
neither
side
was
the
situation
in
the
*NL*
slightest
degree
embarrassing
.
Dr.
Leete
addressed
the
young
man
in
a
*NL*
tone
devoid
,
of
course
,
as
any
gentleman
's
would
be
,
of
*NL*
superciliousness
,
but
at
the
same
time
not
in
any
way
deprecatory
,
*NL*
while
the
manner
of
the
young
man
was
simply
that
of
a
person
intent
*NL*
on
discharging
correctly
the
task
he
was
engaged
in
,
equally
without
*NL*
familiarity
or
obsequiousness
.
It
was
,
in
fact
,
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
soldier
on
duty
,
but
without
the
military
stiffness
.
As
the
youth
left
*NL*
the
room
,
I
said
,
``
I
can
not
get
over
my
wonder
at
seeing
a
young
man
*NL*
like
that
serving
so
contentedly
in
a
menial
position
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
that
word
`
menial
'
?
I
never
heard
it
,
''
said
Edith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
obsolete
now
,
''
remarked
her
father
.
``
If
I
understand
it
*NL*
rightly
,
it
applied
to
persons
who
performed
particularly
disagreeable
*NL*
and
unpleasant
tasks
for
others
,
and
carried
with
it
an
implication
of
*NL*
contempt
.
Was
it
not
so
,
Mr.
West
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
about
it
,
''
I
said
.
``
Personal
service
,
such
as
waiting
on
*NL*
tables
,
was
considered
menial
,
and
held
in
such
contempt
,
in
my
day
,
*NL*
that
persons
of
culture
and
refinement
would
suffer
hardship
before
*NL*
condescending
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
strangely
artificial
idea
,
''
exclaimed
Mrs.
Leete
,
wonderingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
these
services
had
to
be
rendered
,
''
said
Edith
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
''
I
replied
.
``
But
we
imposed
them
on
the
poor
,
and
those
*NL*
who
had
no
alternative
but
starvation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
increased
the
burden
you
imposed
on
them
by
adding
your
*NL*
contempt
,
''
remarked
Dr.
Leete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
clearly
understand
,
''
said
Edith
.
``
Do
you
mean
that
*NL*
you
permitted
people
to
do
things
for
you
which
you
despised
them
for
*NL*
doing
,
or
that
you
accepted
services
from
them
which
you
would
have
*NL*
been
unwilling
to
render
them
?
You
ca
n't
surely
mean
that
,
Mr.
West
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
was
obliged
to
tell
her
that
the
fact
was
just
as
she
had
stated
.
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
,
however
,
came
to
my
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
understand
why
Edith
is
surprised
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
must
know
that
*NL*
nowadays
it
is
an
axiom
of
ethics
that
to
accept
a
service
from
*NL*
another
which
we
would
be
unwilling
to
return
in
kind
,
if
need
were
,
*NL*
is
like
borrowing
with
the
intention
of
not
repaying
,
while
to
enforce
*NL*
such
a
service
by
taking
advantage
of
the
poverty
or
necessity
of
a
*NL*
person
would
be
an
outrage
like
forcible
robbery
.
It
is
the
worst
*NL*
thing
about
any
system
which
divides
men
,
or
allows
them
to
be
*NL*
divided
,
into
classes
and
castes
,
that
it
weakens
the
sense
of
a
*NL*
common
humanity
.
Unequal
distribution
of
wealth
,
and
,
still
more
*NL*
effectually
,
unequal
opportunities
of
education
and
culture
,
divided
*NL*
society
in
your
day
into
classes
which
in
many
respects
regarded
each
*NL*
other
as
distinct
races
.
There
is
not
,
after
all
,
such
a
difference
as
*NL*
might
appear
between
our
ways
of
looking
at
this
question
of
service
.
*NL*
Ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
cultured
class
in
your
day
would
no
more
*NL*
have
permitted
persons
of
their
own
class
to
render
them
services
they
*NL*
would
scorn
to
return
than
we
would
permit
anybody
to
do
so
.
The
poor
*NL*
and
the
uncultured
,
however
,
they
looked
upon
as
of
another
kind
from
*NL*
themselves
.
The
equal
wealth
and
equal
opportunities
of
culture
which
*NL*
all
persons
now
enjoy
have
simply
made
us
all
members
of
one
class
,
*NL*
which
corresponds
to
the
most
fortunate
class
with
you
.
Until
this
*NL*
equality
of
condition
had
come
to
pass
,
the
idea
of
the
solidarity
of
*NL*
humanity
,
the
brother
hood
of
all
men
,
could
never
have
become
the
*NL*
real
conviction
and
practical
principle
of
action
it
is
nowadays
.
In
*NL*
your
day
the
same
phrases
were
indeed
used
,
but
they
were
phrases
*NL*
merely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
the
waiters
,
also
,
volunteer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
The
waiters
are
young
men
in
the
*NL*
unclassified
grade
of
the
industrial
army
who
are
assignable
to
all
*NL*
sorts
of
miscellaneous
occupations
not
requiring
special
skill
.
*NL*
Waiting
on
table
is
one
of
these
,
and
every
young
recruit
is
given
a
*NL*
taste
of
it
.
I
myself
served
as
a
waiter
for
several
months
in
this
*NL*
very
dining-house
some
forty
years
ago
.
Once
more
you
must
remember
*NL*
that
there
is
recognized
no
sort
of
difference
between
the
dignity
of
*NL*
the
different
sorts
of
work
required
by
the
nation
.
The
individual
is
*NL*
never
regarded
,
nor
regards
himself
,
as
the
servant
of
those
he
*NL*
serves
,
nor
is
he
in
any
way
dependent
upon
them
.
It
is
always
the
*NL*
nation
which
he
is
serving
.
No
difference
is
recognized
between
a
*NL*
waiter
's
functions
and
those
of
any
other
worker
.
The
fact
that
his
is
*NL*
a
personal
service
is
indifferent
from
our
point
of
view
.
So
is
a
*NL*
doctor
's
.
I
should
as
soon
expect
our
waiter
to-day
to
look
down
on
me
*NL*
because
I
served
him
as
a
doctor
,
as
think
of
looking
down
on
him
*NL*
because
he
serves
me
as
a
waiter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
my
entertainers
conducted
me
about
the
building
,
of
which
*NL*
the
extent
,
the
magnificent
architecture
and
richness
of
*NL*
embellishment
,
astonished
me
.
It
seemed
that
it
was
not
merely
a
*NL*
dining-hall
,
but
likewise
a
great
pleasure-house
and
social
rendezvous
*NL*
of
the
quarter
,
and
no
appliance
of
entertainment
or
recreation
seemed
*NL*
lacking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
find
illustrated
here
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
when
I
had
expressed
my
*NL*
admiration
,
``
what
I
said
to
you
in
our
first
conversation
,
when
you
*NL*
were
looking
out
over
the
city
,
as
to
the
splendor
of
our
public
and
*NL*
common
life
as
compared
with
the
simplicity
of
our
private
and
home
*NL*
life
,
and
the
contrast
which
,
in
this
respect
,
the
twentieth
bears
to
*NL*
the
nineteenth
century
.
To
save
ourselves
useless
burdens
,
we
have
as
*NL*
little
gear
about
us
at
home
as
is
consistent
with
comfort
,
but
the
*NL*
social
side
of
our
life
is
ornate
and
luxurious
beyond
anything
the
*NL*
world
ever
knew
before
.
All
the
industrial
and
professional
guilds
*NL*
have
clubhouses
as
extensive
as
this
,
as
well
as
country
,
mountain
,

and
seaside
houses
for
sport

*NL*
NOTE
.
In
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
it
became
*NL*
a
practice
of
needy
young
men
at
some
of
the
colleges
of
the
*NL*
country
to
earn
a
little
money
for
their
term
bills
by
*NL*
serving
as
waiters
on
tables
at
hotels
during
the
long
summer
*NL*
vacation
.
It
was
claimed
,
in
reply
to
critics
who
expressed
*NL*
the
prejudices
of
the
time
in
asserting
that
persons
*NL*
voluntarily
following
such
an
occupation
could
not
be
*NL*
gentlemen
,
that
they
were
entitled
to
praise
for
vindicating
,
*NL*
by
their
example
,
the
dignity
of
all
honest
and
necessary
*NL*
labor
.
The
use
of
this
argument
illustrates
a
common
*NL*
confusion
in
thought
on
the
part
of
my
former
contemporaries
.
*NL*
The
business
of
waiting
on
tables
was
in
no
more
need
of
*NL*
defense
than
most
of
the
other
ways
of
getting
a
living
in
*NL*
that
day
,
but
to
talk
of
dignity
attaching
to
labor
of
any
*NL*
sort
under
the
system
then
prevailing
was
absurd
.
There
is
no
*NL*
way
in
which
selling
labor
for
the
highest
price
it
will
*NL*
fetch
is
more
dignified
than
selling
goods
for
what
can
be
*NL*
got
.
Both
were
commercial
transactions
to
be
judged
by
the
*NL*
commercial
standard
.
By
setting
a
price
in
money
on
his
*NL*
service
,
the
worker
accepted
the
money
measure
for
it
,
and
*NL*
renounced
all
clear
claim
to
be
judged
by
any
other
.
The
*NL*
sordid
taint
which
this
necessity
imparted
to
the
noblest
and
*NL*
the
highest
sorts
of
service
was
bitterly
resented
by
*NL*
generous
souls
,
but
there
was
no
evading
it
.
There
was
no
*NL*
exemption
,
however
transcendent
the
quality
of
one
's
service
,
*NL*
from
the
necessity
of
haggling
for
its
price
in
the
*NL*
market-place
.
The
physician
must
sell
his
healing
and
the
*NL*
apostle
his
preaching
like
the
rest
.
The
prophet
,
who
had
*NL*
guessed
the
meaning
of
God
,
must
dicker
for
the
price
of
the
*NL*
revelation
,
and
the
poet
hawk
his
visions
in
printers
'
row
.
*NL*
If
I
were
asked
to
name
the
most
distinguishing
felicity
of
*NL*
this
age
,
as
compared
to
that
in
which
I
first
saw
the
light
,
*NL*
I
should
say
that
to
me
it
seems
to
consist
in
the
dignity
*NL*
you
have
given
to
labor
by
refusing
to
set
a
price
upon
it
*NL*
and
abolishing
the
market-place
forever
.
By
requiring
of
*NL*
every
man
his
best
you
have
made
God
his
task-master
,
and
by
*NL*
making
honor
the
sole
reward
of
achievement
you
have
imparted
*NL*
to
all
service
the
distinction
peculiar
in
my
day
to
the

soldier

When

in

we
came
to

we
succumbed
to
the
temptation
of
the
luxurious
leather
chairs
with

which
it
was
furnished
,

sat
down
in
one
of

book-lined
alcoves

to
rest
and

enthusiastically

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
judge
,
then
,
that
there
has
been
some
notable
literature
produced
*NL*
in
this
century
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
.
``
It
has
been
an
era
of
unexampled
intellectual
*NL*
splendor
.
Probably
humanity
never
before
passed
through
a
moral
and
*NL*
material
evolution
,
at
once
so
vast
in
its
scope
and
brief
in
its
time
*NL*
of
accomplishment
,
as
that
from
the
old
order
to
the
new
in
the
early
*NL*
part
of
this
century
.
When
men
came
to
realize
the
greatness
of
the
*NL*
felicity
which
had
befallen
them
,
and
that
the
change
through
which
*NL*
they
had
passed
was
not
merely
an
improvement
in
details
of
their
*NL*
condition
,
but
the
rise
of
the
race
to
a
new
plane
of
existence
with
*NL*
an
illimitable
vista
of
progress
,
their
minds
were
affected
in
all
*NL*
their
faculties
with
a
stimulus
,
of
which
the
outburst
of
the
mediaeval
*NL*
renaissance
offers
a
suggestion
but
faint
indeed
.
There
ensued
an
era
*NL*
of
mechanical
invention
,
scientific
discovery
,
art
,
musical
and
*NL*
literary
productiveness
to
which
no
previous
age
of
the
world
offers
*NL*
anything
comparable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
said
I
,
``
talking
of
literature
,
how
are
books
published
*NL*
now
?
Is
that
also
done
by
the
nation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
do
you
manage
it
?
Does
the
government
publish
everything
that
*NL*
is
brought
it
as
a
matter
of
course
,
at
the
public
expense
,
or
does
*NL*
it
exercise
a
censorship
and
print
only
what
it
approves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither
way
.
The
printing
department
has
no
censorial
powers
.
It
is
*NL*
bound
to
print
all
that
is
offered
it
,
but
prints
it
only
on
condition
*NL*
that
the
author
defray
the
first
cost
out
of
his
credit
.
He
must
pay
*NL*
for
the
privilege
of
the
public
ear
,
and
if
he
has
any
message
worth
*NL*
hearing
we
consider
that
he
will
be
glad
to
do
it
.
Of
course
,
if
*NL*
incomes
were
unequal
,
as
in
the
old
times
,
this
rule
would
enable
only
*NL*
the
rich
to
be
authors
,
but
the
resources
of
citizens
being
equal
,
it
*NL*
merely
measures
the
strength
of
the
author
's
motive
.
The
cost
of
an
*NL*
edition
of
an
average
book
can
be
saved
out
of
a
year
's
credit
by
the
*NL*
practice
of
economy
and
some
sacrifices
.
The
book
,
on
being
published
,
*NL*
is
placed
on
sale
by
the
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
author
receiving
a
royalty
on
the
sales
as
with
us
,
I
suppose
,
''
I
*NL*
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
as
with
you
,
certainly
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
but
nevertheless
in
*NL*
one
way
.
The
price
of
every
book
is
made
up
of
the
cost
of
its
*NL*
publication
with
a
royalty
for
the
author
.
The
author
fixes
this
*NL*
royalty
at
any
figure
he
pleases
.
Of
course
if
he
puts
it
unreasonably
*NL*
high
it
is
his
own
loss
,
for
the
book
will
not
sell
.
The
amount
of
*NL*
this
royalty
is
set
to
his
credit
and
he
is
discharged
from
other
*NL*
service
to
the
nation
for
so
long
a
period
as
this
credit
at
the
rate
*NL*
of
allowance
for
the
support
of
citizens
shall
suffice
to
support
him
.
*NL*
If
his
book
be
moderately
successful
,
he
has
thus
a
furlough
for
*NL*
several
months
,
a
year
,
two
or
three
years
,
and
if
he
in
the
mean
time
*NL*
produces
other
successful
work
,
the
remission
of
service
is
extended
*NL*
so
far
as
the
sale
of
that
may
justify
.
An
author
of
much
acceptance
*NL*
succeeds
in
supporting
himself
by
his
pen
during
the
entire
period
of
*NL*
service
,
and
the
degree
of
any
writer
's
literary
ability
,
as
*NL*
determined
by
the
popular
voice
,
is
thus
the
measure
of
the
*NL*
opportunity
given
him
to
devote
his
time
to
literature
.
In
this
*NL*
respect
the
outcome
of
our
system
is
not
very
dissimilar
to
that
of
*NL*
yours
,
but
there
are
two
notable
differences
.
In
the
first
place
,
the
*NL*
universally
high
level
of
education
nowadays
gives
the
popular
verdict
*NL*
a
conclusiveness
on
the
real
merit
of
literary
work
which
in
your
day
*NL*
it
was
as
far
as
possible
from
having
.
In
the
second
place
,
there
is
*NL*
no
such
thing
now
as
favoritism
of
any
sort
to
interfere
with
the
*NL*
recognition
of
true
merit
.
Every
author
has
precisely
the
same
*NL*
facilities
for
bringing
his
work
before
the
popular
tribunal
.
To
judge
*NL*
from
the
complaints
of
the
writers
of
your
day
,
this
absolute
equality
*NL*
of
opportunity
would
have
been
greatly
prized
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
the
recognition
of
merit
in
other
fields
of
original
genius
,
such
*NL*
as
music
,
art
,
invention
,
design
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
suppose
you
follow
a
*NL*
similar
principle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
,
``
although
the
details
differ
.
In
art
,
for
example
,
*NL*
as
in
literature
,
the
people
are
the
sole
judges
.
They
vote
upon
the
*NL*
acceptance
of
statues
and
paintings
for
the
public
buildings
,
and
*NL*
their
favorable
verdict
carries
with
it
the
artist
's
remission
from
*NL*
other
tasks
to
devote
himself
to
his
vocation
.
On
copies
of
his
work
*NL*
disposed
of
,
he
also
derives
the
same
advantage
as
the
author
on
sales
*NL*
of
his
books
.
In
all
these
lines
of
original
genius
the
plan
pursued
*NL*
is
the
same
,
--
to
offer
a
free
field
to
aspirants
,
and
as
soon
as
*NL*
exceptional
talent
is
recognized
to
release
it
from
all
trammels
and
*NL*
let
it
have
free
course
.
The
remission
of
other
service
in
these
cases
*NL*
is
not
intended
as
a
gift
or
reward
,
but
as
the
means
of
obtaining
*NL*
more
and
higher
service
.
Of
course
there
are
various
literary
,
art
,
*NL*
and
scientific
institutes
to
which
membership
comes
to
the
famous
and
*NL*
is
greatly
prized
.
The
highest
of
all
honors
in
the
nation
,
higher
*NL*
than
the
presidency
,
which
calls
merely
for
good
sense
and
devotion
to
*NL*
duty
,
is
the
red
ribbon
awarded
by
the
vote
of
the
people
to
the
great
*NL*
authors
,
artists
,
engineers
,
physicians
,
and
inventors
of
the
*NL*
generation
.
Not
over
a
certain
number
wear
it
at
any
one
time
,
though
*NL*
every
bright
young
fellow
in
the
country
loses
innumerable
nights
'
*NL*
sleep
dreaming
of
it
.
I
even
did
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
if
mamma
and
I
would
have
thought
any
more
of
you
with
it
,
''
*NL*
exclaimed
Edith
;
``
not
that
it
is
n't
,
of
course
,
a
very
fine
thing
to
*NL*
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
no
choice
,
my
dear
,
but
to
take
your
father
as
you
found
him
*NL*
and
make
the
best
of
him
,
''
Dr.
Leete
replied
;
``
but
as
for
your
*NL*
mother
,
there
,
she
would
never
have
had
me
if
I
had
not
assured
her
*NL*
that
I
was
bound
to
get
the
red
ribbon
or
at
least
the
blue
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
extravagance
Mrs.
Leete
's
only
comment
was
a
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
periodicals
and
newspapers
?
''
I
said
.
``
I
wo
n't
deny
that
*NL*
your
book
publishing
system
is
a
considerable
improvement
on
ours
,
*NL*
both
as
to
its
tendency
to
encourage
a
real
literary
vocation
,
and
,
*NL*
quite
as
important
,
to
discourage
mere
scribblers
;
but
I
do
n't
see
how
*NL*
it
can
be
made
to
apply
to
magazines
and
newspapers
.
It
is
very
well
*NL*
to
make
a
man
pay
for
publishing
a
book
,
because
the
expense
will
be
*NL*
only
occasional
;
but
no
man
could
afford
the
expense
of
publishing
a
*NL*
newspaper
every
day
in
the
year
.
It
took
the
deep
pockets
of
our
*NL*
private
capitalists
to
do
that
,
and
often
exhausted
even
them
before
*NL*
the
returns
came
in
.
If
you
have
newspapers
at
all
,
they
must
,
I
*NL*
fancy
,
be
published
by
the
government
at
the
public
expense
,
with
*NL*
government
editors
,
reflecting
government
opinions
.
Now
,
if
your
*NL*
system
is
so
perfect
that
there
is
never
anything
to
criticise
in
the
*NL*
conduct
of
affairs
,
this
arrangement
may
answer
.
Otherwise
I
should
*NL*
think
the
lack
of
an
independent
unofficial
medium
for
the
expression
*NL*
of
public
opinion
would
have
most
unfortunate
results
.
Confess
,
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
,
that
a
free
newspaper
press
,
with
all
that
it
implies
,
was
a
*NL*
redeeming
incident
of
the
old
system
when
capital
was
in
private
*NL*
hands
,
and
that
you
have
to
set
off
the
loss
of
that
against
your
*NL*
gains
in
other
respects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
ca
n't
give
you
even
that
consolation
,
''
replied
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
,
laughing
.
``
In
the
first
place
,
Mr.
West
,
the
newspaper
press
is
*NL*
by
no
means
the
only
or
,
as
we
look
at
it
,
the
best
vehicle
for
*NL*
serious
criticism
of
public
affairs
.
To
us
,
the
judgments
of
your
*NL*
newspapers
on
such
themes
seem
generally
to
have
been
crude
and
*NL*
flippant
,
as
well
as
deeply
tinctured
with
prejudice
and
bitterness
.
*NL*
In
so
far
as
they
may
be
taken
as
expressing
public
opinion
,
they
give
*NL*
an
unfavorable
impression
of
the
popular
intelligence
,
while
so
far
as
*NL*
they
may
have
formed
public
opinion
,
the
nation
was
not
to
be
*NL*
felicitated
.
Nowadays
,
when
a
citizen
desires
to
make
a
serious
*NL*
impression
upon
the
public
mind
as
to
any
aspect
of
public
affairs
,
he
*NL*
comes
out
with
a
book
or
pamphlet
,
published
as
other
books
are
.
But
*NL*
this
is
not
because
we
lack
newspapers
and
magazines
,
or
that
they
*NL*
lack
the
most
absolute
freedom
.
The
newspaper
press
is
organized
so
as
*NL*
to
be
a
more
perfect
expression
of
public
opinion
than
it
possibly
*NL*
could
be
in
your
day
,
when
private
capital
controlled
and
managed
it
*NL*
primarily
as
a
money-making
business
,
and
secondarily
only
as
a
*NL*
mouthpiece
for
the
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
''
said
I
,
``
if
the
government
prints
the
papers
at
the
public
*NL*
expense
,
how
can
it
fail
to
control
their
policy
?
Who
appoints
the
*NL*
editors
,
if
not
the
government
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
government
does
not
pay
the
expense
of
the
papers
,
nor
appoint
*NL*
their
editors
,
nor
in
any
way
exert
the
slightest
influence
on
their
*NL*
policy
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
The
people
who
take
the
paper
pay
the
*NL*
expense
of
its
publication
,
choose
its
editor
,
and
remove
him
when
*NL*
unsatisfactory
.
You
will
scarcely
say
,
I
think
,
that
such
a
newspaper
*NL*
press
is
not
a
free
organ
of
popular
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Decidedly
I
shall
not
,
''
I
replied
,
``
but
how
is
it
practicable
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
simpler
.
Supposing
some
of
my
neighbors
or
myself
*NL*
think
we
ought
to
have
a
newspaper
reflecting
our
opinions
,
and
*NL*
devoted
especially
to
our
locality
,
trade
,
or
profession
.
We
go
about
*NL*
among
the
people
till
we
get
the
names
of
such
a
number
that
their
*NL*
annual
subscriptions
will
meet
the
cost
of
the
paper
,
which
is
little
*NL*
or
big
according
to
the
largeness
of
its
constituency
.
The
amount
of
*NL*
the
subscriptions
marked
off
the
credits
of
the
citizens
guarantees
*NL*
the
nation
against
loss
in
publishing
the
paper
,
its
business
,
you
*NL*
understand
,
being
that
of
a
publisher
purely
,
with
no
option
to
refuse
*NL*
the
duty
required
.
The
subscribers
to
the
paper
now
elect
somebody
as
*NL*
editor
,
who
,
if
he
accepts
the
office
,
is
discharged
from
other
*NL*
service
during
his
incumbency
.
Instead
of
paying
a
salary
to
him
,
as
*NL*
in
your
day
,
the
subscribers
pay
the
nation
an
indemnity
equal
to
the
*NL*
cost
of
his
support
for
taking
him
away
from
the
general
service
.
He
*NL*
manages
the
paper
just
as
one
of
your
editors
did
,
except
that
he
has
*NL*
no
counting-room
to
obey
,
or
interests
of
private
capital
as
against
*NL*
the
public
good
to
defend
.
At
the
end
of
the
first
year
,
the
*NL*
subscribers
for
the
next
either
reelect
the
former
editor
or
choose
*NL*
any
one
else
to
his
place
.
An
able
editor
,
of
course
,
keeps
his
place
*NL*
indefinitely
.
As
the
subscription
list
enlarges
,
the
funds
of
the
*NL*
paper
increase
,
and
it
is
improved
by
the
securing
of
more
and
better
*NL*
contributors
,
just
as
your
papers
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
the
staff
of
contributors
recompensed
,
since
they
can
not
be
*NL*
paid
in
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
editor
settles
with
them
the
price
of
their
wares
.
The
amount
is
*NL*
transferred
to
their
individual
credit
from
the
guarantee
credit
of
*NL*
the
paper
,
and
a
remission
of
service
is
granted
the
contributor
for
a
*NL*
length
of
time
corresponding
to
the
amount
credited
him
,
just
as
to
*NL*
other
authors
.
As
to
magazines
,
the
system
is
the
same
.
Those
*NL*
interested
in
the
prospectus
of
a
new
periodical
pledge
enough

subscriptions
to
run
it
for
a
year

select
their
editor

who
*NL*
recompenses
his
contributors
just

printing
*NL*
bureau
furnishing
the
necessary
force

material
for
publication

as

no
longer
desired

he
*NL*
simply
resumes
his
place
in
the
industrial
army
.
I
should
add
that
,
*NL*
though
ordinarily
the
editor
is
elected
only
at
the
end
of
the
year
,
*NL*
and
as
a
rule
is
continued
in
office
for
a
term
of
years
,
in
case
of
*NL*
any
sudden
change
he
should
give
to
the
tone
of
the
paper
,
provision
*NL*
is
made
for
taking
the
sense
of
the
subscribers
as
to
his
removal
at
*NL*
any
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
However
earnestly
a
man
may
long
for
leisure
for
purposes
of
study
or
*NL*
meditation
,
''
I
remarked
,
``
he
can
not
get
out
of
the
harness
,
if
I
*NL*
understand
you
rightly
,
except
in
these
two
ways
you
have
mentioned
.
*NL*
He
must
either
by
literary
,
artistic
,
or
inventive
productiveness
*NL*
indemnify
the
nation
for
the
loss
of
his
services
,
or
must
get
a
*NL*
sufficient
number
of
other
people
to
contribute
to
such
an
indemnity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
most
certain
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
that
no
able-bodied
man
*NL*
nowadays
can
evade
his
share
of
work
and
live
on
the
toil
of
others
,
*NL*
whether
he
calls
himself
by
the
fine
name
of
student
or
confesses
to
*NL*
being
simply
lazy
.
At
the
same
time
our
system
is
elastic
enough
to
*NL*
give
free
play
to
every
instinct
of
human
nature
which
does
not
aim
at
*NL*
dominating
others
or
living
on
the
fruit
of
others
'
labor
.
There
is
*NL*
not
only
the
remission
by
indemnification
but
the
remission
by
*NL*
abnegation
.
Any
man
in
his
thirty-third
year
,
his
term
of
service
*NL*
being
then
half
done
,
can
obtain
an
honorable
discharge
from
the
army
,
*NL*
provided
he
accepts
for
the
rest
of
his
life
one
half
the
rate
of
*NL*
maintenance
other
citizens
receive
.
It
is
quite
possible
to
live
on
*NL*
this
amount
,
though
one
must
forego
the
luxuries
and
elegancies
of
*NL*
life
,
with
some
,
perhaps
,
of
its
comforts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
ladies
retired
that
evening
,
Edith
brought
me
a
book
and
*NL*
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
should
be
wakeful
to-night
,
Mr.
West
,
you
might
be
interested
*NL*
in
looking
over
this
story
by
Berrian
.
It
is
considered
his
*NL*
masterpiece
,
and
will
at
least
give
you
an
idea
what
the
stories
*NL*
nowadays
are
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
sat
up
in
my
room
that
night
reading
``
Penthesilia
''
till
it
grew
gray
*NL*
in
the
east
,
and
did
not
lay
it
down
till
I
had
finished
it
.
And
yet
*NL*
let
no
admirer
of
the
great
romancer
of
the
twentieth
century
resent
*NL*
my
saying
that
at
the
first
reading
what
most
impressed
me
was
not
so
*NL*
much
what
was
in
the
book
as
what
was
left
out
of
it
.
The
*NL*
story-writers
of
my
day
would
have
deemed
the
making
of
bricks
without
*NL*
straw
a
light
task
compared
with
the
construction
of
a
romance
from
*NL*
which
should
be
excluded
all
effects
drawn
from
the
contrasts
of
*NL*
wealth
and
poverty
,
education
and
ignorance
,
coarseness
and
*NL*
refinement
,
high
and
low
,
all
motives
drawn
from
social
pride
and
*NL*
ambition
,
the
desire
of
being
richer
or
the
fear
of
being
poorer
,
*NL*
together
with
sordid
anxieties
of
any
sort
for
one
's
self
or
others
;
a
*NL*
romance
in
which
there
should
,
indeed
,
be
love
galore
,
but
love
*NL*
unfretted
by
artificial
barriers
created
by
differences
of
station
or
*NL*
possessions
,
owning
no
other
law
but
that
of
the
heart
.
The
reading
of
*NL*
``
Penthesilia
''
was
of
more
value
than
almost
any
amount
of
explanation
*NL*
would
have
been
in
giving
me
something
like
a
general
impression
of
*NL*
the
social
aspect
of
the
twentieth
century
.
The
information
Dr.
Leete
*NL*
had
imparted
was
indeed
extensive
as
to
facts
,
but
they
had
affected
*NL*
my
mind
as
so
many
separate
impressions
,
which
I
had
as
yet
succeeded
*NL*
but
imperfectly
in
making
cohere
.
Berrian
put
them
together
for
me
in
*NL*
a
picture

with
the
intolerable

CHAPTER
XVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
I
rose
somewhat
before
the
breakfast
hour
.
As
I
descended
*NL*
the
stairs
,
Edith
stepped
into
the
hall
from
the
room
which
had
been
*NL*
the
scene
of
the
morning
interview
between
us
described
some
chapters
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
a
charmingly
arch
expression
,
``
you
thought
*NL*
to
slip
out
unbeknown
for
another
of
those
solitary
morning
rambles
*NL*
which
have
such
nice
effects
on
you
.
But
you
see
I
am
up
too
early
for
*NL*
you
this
time
.
You
are
fairly
caught
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
discredit
the
efficacy
of
your
own
cure
,
''
I
said
,
``
by
supposing
*NL*
that
such
a
ramble
would
now
be
attended
with
bad
consequences
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
to
hear
that
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
was
in
here
arranging
some
*NL*
flowers
for
the
breakfast
table
when
I
heard
you
come
down
,
and
*NL*
fancied
I
detected
something
surreptitious
in
your
step
on
the
*NL*
stairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
me
injustice
,
''
I
replied
.
``
I
had
no
idea
of
going
out
at
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
her
effort
to
convey
an
impression
that
my
interception
was
*NL*
purely
accidental
,
I
had
at
the
time
a
dim
suspicion
of
what
I
*NL*
afterwards
learned
to
be
the
fact
,
namely
,
that
this
sweet
creature
,
*NL*
in
pursuance
of
her
self-assumed
guardianship
over
me
,
had
risen
for
*NL*
the
last
two
or
three
mornings
at
an
unheard-of
hour
,
to
insure
*NL*
against
the
possibility
of
my
wandering
off
alone
in
case
I
should
be
*NL*
affected
as
on
the
former
occasion
.
Receiving
permission
to
assist
her
*NL*
in
making
up
the
breakfast
bouquet
,
I
followed
her
into
the
room
from
*NL*
which
she
had
emerged
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
,
''
she
asked
,
``
that
you
are
quite
done
with
those
*NL*
terrible
sensations
you
had
that
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
say
that
I
do
not
have
times
of
feeling
decidedly
queer
,
''
I
*NL*
replied
,
``
moments
when
my
personal
identity
seems
an
open
question
.
It
*NL*
would
be
too
much
to
expect
after
my
experience
that
I
should
not
have
*NL*
such
sensations
occasionally
,
but
as
for
being
carried
entirely
off
my
*NL*
feet
,
as
I
was
on
the
point
of
being
that
morning
,
I
think
the
danger
*NL*
is
past
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
never
forget
how
you
looked
that
morning
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
merely
saved
my
life
,
''
I
continued
,
``
I
might
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
find
words
to
express
my
gratitude
,
but
it
was
my
reason
you
saved
,
*NL*
and
there
are
no
words
that
would
not
belittle
my
debt
to
you
.
''
I
*NL*
spoke
with
emotion
,
and
her
eyes
grew
suddenly
moist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
too
much
to
believe
all
this
,
''
she
said
,
``
but
it
is
very
*NL*
delightful
to
hear
you
say
it
.
What
I
did
was
very
little
.
I
was
very
*NL*
much
distressed
for
you
,
I
know
.
Father
never
thinks
anything
ought
to
*NL*
astonish
us
when
it
can
be
explained
scientifically
,
as
I
suppose
this
*NL*
long
sleep
of
yours
can
be
,
but
even
to
fancy
myself
in
your
place
*NL*
makes
my
head
swim
.
I
know
that
I
could
not
have
borne
it
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
depend
,
''
I
replied
,
``
on
whether
an
angel
came
to
support
*NL*
you
with
her
sympathy
in
the
crisis
of
your
condition
,
as
one
came
to
*NL*
me
.
''
If
my
face
at
all
expressed
the
feelings
I
had
a
right
to
have
*NL*
toward
this
sweet
and
lovely
young
girl
,
who
had
played
so
angelic
a
*NL*
role
toward
me
,
its
expression
must
have
been
very
worshipful
just
*NL*
then
.
The
expression
or
the
words
,
or
both
together
,
caused
her
now
to
*NL*
drop
her
eyes
with
a
charming
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
the
matter
of
that
,
''
I
said
,
``
if
your
experience
has
not
been
as
*NL*
startling
as
mine
,
it
must
have
been
rather
overwhelming
to
see
a
man
*NL*
belonging
to
a
strange
century
,
and
apparently
a
hundred
years
dead
,
*NL*
raised
to
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seemed
indeed
strange
beyond
any
describing
at
first
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
``
but
when
we
began
to
put
ourselves
in
your
place
,
and
realize
how
*NL*
much
stranger
it
must
seem
to
you
,
I
fancy
we
forgot
our
own
feelings
*NL*
a
good
deal
,
at
least
I
know
I
did
.
It
seemed
then
not
so
much
*NL*
astounding
as
interesting
and
touching
beyond
anything
ever
heard
of
*NL*
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
does
it
not
come
over
you
as
astounding
to
sit
at
table
with
me
,
*NL*
seeing
who
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
remember
that
you
do
not
seem
so
strange
to
us
as
we
must
to
*NL*
you
,
''
she
answered
.
``
We
belong
to
a
future
of
which
you
could
not
form
*NL*
an
idea
,
a
generation
of
which
you
knew
nothing
until
you
saw
us
.
But
*NL*
you
belong
to
a
generation
of
which
our
forefathers
were
a
part
.
We
*NL*
know
all
about
it
;
the
names
of
many
of
its
members
are
household
*NL*
words
with
us

We
have
made
a
study
of
your
ways
of
living
and
*NL*
thinking
;
nothing
you
say
or
do
surprises
us
,
while
we
say
and
do
*NL*
nothing
which
does
not
seem
strange
to
you

So
you
see
,
Mr.
West
,
that
*NL*
if
you
feel
that
you
can
,
in
time
,
get
accustomed
to
us

you
must
not
*NL*
be
surprised

from
the

scarcely
found
you
strange

all

``
I
had
not

it
in
that
way

I
replied

There
is
indeed
*NL*
much
in
what

One
can
look
back
a
thousand
years
easier

forward
fifty
.
A
century
is
not
so
very
long
a
retrospect

I
might
*NL*
have
known
your
great-grand-parents

Possibly
I
did

Did
they
live
in

Boston

``
I

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
replied

``
Now
I
think
,
they
did

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
a
very
large
circle
of
acquaintances
in
the
city

I
said
.
``
It

is
not
unlikely
that

known

well

Would

I
should
chance

to
be
able
to
tell
you
all
about
your
great-grandfather

for
*NL*
instance

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
interesting

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
your
genealogy
well
enough

the
Boston
of

day

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
then
,
you
will
some
time
tell

what
some
of
their

*NL*
were

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
engrossed
in
arranging
a
troublesome
spray
of
green
,
and
did
*NL*
not
reply
at
once
.
Steps
upon
the
stairway
indicated
that
the
other
*NL*
members
of
the
family
were
descending
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

some
time

she
said

*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
,
Dr.
Leete
suggested
taking
me
to
inspect
the
central
*NL*
warehouse
and
observe
actually
in
operation
the
machinery
of
*NL*
distribution
,
which
Edith
had
described
to
me
.
As
we
walked
away
from
*NL*
the
house
I
said
,
``
It
is
now
several
days
that
I
have
been
living
in
*NL*
your
household
on
a
most
extraordinary
footing
,
or
rather
on
none
at
*NL*
all
.
I
have
not
spoken
of
this
aspect
of
my
position
before
because
*NL*
there
were
so
many
other
aspects
yet
more
extraordinary
.
But
now
that
*NL*
I
am
beginning
a
little
to
feel
my
feet
under
me
,
and
to
realize
that
,
*NL*
however
I
came
here
,
I
am
here
,
and
must
make
the
best
of
it
,
I
must
*NL*
speak
to
you
on
this
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
for
your
being
a
guest
in
my
house
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
I
pray
*NL*
you
not
to
begin
to
be
uneasy
on
that
point
,
for
I
mean
to
keep
you
a
*NL*
long
time
yet
.
With
all
your
modesty
,
you
can
but
realize
that
such
a
*NL*
guest
as
yourself
is
an
acquisition
not
willingly
to
be
parted
with
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
,
doctor
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
would
be
absurd
,
certainly
,
for
me
to
*NL*
affect
any
oversensitiveness
about
accepting
the
temporary
hospitality
*NL*
of
one
to
whom
I
owe
it
that
I
am
not
still
awaiting
the
end
of
the
*NL*
world
in
a
living
tomb
.
But
if
I
am
to
be
a
permanent
citizen
of
this
*NL*
century
I
must
have
some
standing
in
it
.
Now
,
in
my
time
a
person
more
*NL*
or
less
entering
the
world
,
however
he
got
in
,
would
not
be
noticed
in
*NL*
the
unorganized
throng
of
men
,
and
might
make
a
place
for
himself
*NL*
anywhere
he
chose
if
he
were
strong
enough
.
But
nowadays
everybody
is
*NL*
a
part
of
a
system
with
a
distinct
place
and
function
.
I
am
outside
*NL*
the
system
,
and
do
n't
see
how
I
can
get
in
;
there
seems
no
way
to
get
*NL*
in
,
except
to
be
born
in
or
to
come
in
as
an
emigrant
from
some
other
*NL*
system
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
laughed
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
admit
,
''
he
said
,
``
that
our
system
is
defective
in
lacking
provision
*NL*
for
cases
like
yours
,
but
you
see
nobody
anticipated
additions
to
the
*NL*
world
except
by
the
usual
process
.
You
need
,
however
,
have
no
fear
*NL*
that
we
shall
be
unable
to
provide
both
a
place
and
occupation
for
you
*NL*
in
due
time
.
You
have
as
yet
been
brought
in
contact
only
with
the
*NL*
members
of
my
family
,
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
I
have
kept
your
*NL*
secret
.
On
the
contrary
,
your
case
,
even
before
your
resuscitation
,
*NL*
and
vastly
more
since
,
has
excited
the
profoundest
interest
in
the
*NL*
nation
.
In
view
of
your
precarious
nervous
condition
,
it
was
thought
*NL*
best
that
I
should
take
exclusive
charge
of
you
at
first
,
and
that
you
*NL*
should
,
through
me
and
my
family
,
receive
some
general
idea
of
the
*NL*
sort
of
world
you
had
come
back
to
before
you
began
to
make
the
*NL*
acquaintance
generally
of
its
inhabitants
.
As
to
finding
a
function
*NL*
for
you
in
society
,
there
was
no
hesitation
as
to
what
that
would
be
.
*NL*
Few
of
us
have
it
in
our
power
to
confer
so
great
a
service
on
the
*NL*
nation
as
you
will
be
able
to
when
you
leave
my
roof
,
which
,
however
,
*NL*
you
must
not
think
of
doing
for
a
good
time
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
can
I
possibly
do
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Perhaps
you
imagine
I
have
some
*NL*
trade
,
or
art
,
or
special
skill
.
I
assure
you
I
have
none
whatever
.
I
*NL*
never
earned
a
dollar
in
my
life
,
or
did
an
hour
's
work
.
I
am
strong
,
*NL*
and
might
be
a
common
laborer
,
but
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
were
the
most
efficient
service
you
were
able
to
render
the
*NL*
nation
,
you
would
find
that
avocation
considered
quite
as
respectable
*NL*
as
any
other
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
;
``
but
you
can
do
something
else
*NL*
better
.
You
are
easily
the
master
of
all
our
historians
on
questions
*NL*
relating
to
the
social
condition
of
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
to
us
one
of
the
most
absorbingly
interesting
periods
of
*NL*
history
;
and
whenever
in
due
time
you
have
sufficiently
familiarized
*NL*
yourself
with
our
institutions
,
and
are
willing
to
teach
us
something
*NL*
concerning
those
of
your
day
,
you
will
find
an
historical
lectureship
*NL*
in
one
of
our
colleges
awaiting
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
!
very
good
indeed
,
''
I
said
,
much
relieved
by
so
practical
a
*NL*
suggestion
on
a
point
which
had
begun
to
trouble
me
.
``
If
your
people
*NL*
are
really
so
much
interested
in
the
nineteenth
century

there
will
*NL*
indeed
be
an
occupation
ready-made
for
me
.
I
do
n't
think
there
is
*NL*
anything
else
that
I
could
possibly
earn
my
salt
at
,
but
I
certainly
*NL*
may
claim
without
conceit
to
have
some
special
qualifications
for
such
*NL*
a
post
as
you
describe

CHAPTER
XVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
found
the
processes
at
the
warehouse
quite
as
interesting
as
Edith
*NL*
had
described
them
,
and
became
even
enthusiastic
over
the
truly
*NL*
remarkable
illustration
which
is
seen
there
of
the
prodigiously
*NL*
multiplied
efficiency
which
perfect
organization
can
give
to
labor
.
It
*NL*
is
like
a
gigantic
mill
,
into
the
hopper
of
which
goods
are
being
*NL*
constantly
poured
by
the
train-load
and
ship-load
,
to
issue
at
the
*NL*
other
end
in
packages
of
pounds
and
ounces
,
yards
and
inches
,
pints
*NL*
and
gallons
,
corresponding
to
the
infinitely
complex
personal
needs
of
*NL*
half
a
million
people
.
Dr.
Leete
,
with
the
assistance
of
data
*NL*
furnished
by
me
as
to
the
way
goods
were
sold
in
my
day
,
figured
out
*NL*
some
astounding
results
in
the
way
of
the
economies
effected
by
the
*NL*
modern
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
we
set
out
homeward
,
I
said
:
``
After
what
I
have
seen
to-day
,
*NL*
together
with
what
you
have
told
me
,
and
what
I
learned
under
Miss
*NL*
Leete
's
tutelage
at
the
sample
store
,
I
have
a
tolerably
clear
idea
of
*NL*
your
system
of
distribution
,
and
how
it
enables
you
to
dispense
with
a
*NL*
circulating
medium
.
But
I
should
like
very
much
to
know
something
more
*NL*
about
your
system
of
production
.
You
have
told
me
in
general
how
your
*NL*
industrial
army
is
levied
and
organized
,
but
who
directs
its
efforts
?
*NL*
What
supreme
authority
determines
what
shall
be
done
in
every
*NL*
department
,
so
that
enough
of
everything
is
produced
and
yet
no
labor
*NL*
wasted
?
It
seems
to
me
that
this
must
be
a
wonderfully
complex
and
*NL*
difficult
function
,
requiring
very
unusual
endowments
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
it
indeed
seem
so
to
you
?
''
responded
Dr.
Leete
.
``
I
assure
you
*NL*
that
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
,
but
on
the
other
hand
so
simple
,
and
*NL*
depending
on
principles
so
obvious
and
easily
applied
,
that
the
*NL*
functionaries
at
Washington
to
whom
it
is
trusted
require
to
be
*NL*
nothing
more
than
men
of
fair
abilities
to
discharge
it
to
the
entire
*NL*
satisfaction
of
the
nation
.
The
machine
which
they
direct
is
indeed
a
*NL*
vast
one
,
but
so
logical
in
its
principles
and
direct
and
simple
in
*NL*
its
workings
,
that
it
all
but
runs
itself
;
and
nobody
but
a
fool
could
*NL*
derange
it
,
as
I
think
you
will
agree
after
a
few
words
of
*NL*
explanation
.
Since
you
already
have
a
pretty
good
idea
of
the
working
*NL*
of
the
distributive
system
,
let
us
begin
at
that
end
.
Even
in
your
day
*NL*
statisticians
were
able
to
tell
you
the
number
of
yards
of
cotton
,
*NL*
velvet
,
woolen
,
the
number
of
barrels
of
flour
,
potatoes
,
butter
,
*NL*
number
of
pairs
of
shoes
,
hats
,
and
umbrellas
annually
consumed
by
the
*NL*
nation
.
Owing
to
the
fact
that
production
was
in
private
hands
,
and
*NL*
that
there
was
no
way
of
getting
statistics
of
actual
distribution
,
*NL*
these
figures
were
not
exact
,
but
they
were
nearly
so
.
Now
that
every
*NL*
pin
which
is
given
out
from
a
national
warehouse
is
recorded
,
of
*NL*
course
the
figures
of
consumption
for
any
week
,
month
,
or
year
,
in
the
*NL*
possession
of
the
department
of
distribution
at
the
end
of
that
*NL*
period
,
are
precise
.
On
these
figures
,
allowing
for
tendencies
to
*NL*
increase
or
decrease
and
for
any
special
causes
likely
to
affect
*NL*
demand
,
the
estimates
,
say
for
a
year
ahead
,
are
based
.
These
*NL*
estimates
,
with
a
proper
margin
for
security
,
having
been
accepted
by
*NL*
the
general
administration
,
the
responsibility
of
the
distributive
*NL*
department
ceases
until
the
goods
are
delivered
to
it
.
I
speak
of
the
*NL*
estimates
being
furnished
for
an
entire
year
ahead
,
but
in
reality
*NL*
they
cover
that
much
time
only
in
case
of
the
great
staples
for
which
*NL*
the
demand
can
be
calculated
on
as
steady
.
In
the
great
majority
of
*NL*
smaller
industries
for
the
product
of
which
popular
taste
fluctuates
,
*NL*
and
novelty
is
frequently
required
,
production
is
kept
barely
ahead
of
*NL*
consumption
,
the
distributive
department
furnishing
frequent
estimates
*NL*
based
on
the
weekly
state
of
demand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
the
entire
field
of
productive
and
constructive
industry
is
*NL*
divided
into
ten
great
departments
,
each
representing
a
group
of
*NL*
allied
industries
,
each
particular
industry
being
in
turn
represented
*NL*
by
a
subordinate
bureau
,
which
has
a
complete
record
of
the
plant
and
*NL*
force
under
its
control
,
of
the
present
product
,
and
means
of
*NL*
increasing
it
.
The
estimates
of
the
distributive
department
,
after
*NL*
adoption
by
the
administration
,
are
sent
as
mandates
to
the
ten
great
*NL*
departments
,
which
allot
them
to
the
subordinate
bureaus
representing
*NL*
the
particular
industries
,
and
these
set
the
men
at
work
.
Each
bureau
*NL*
is
responsible
for
the
task
given
it
,
and
this
responsibility
is
*NL*
enforced
by
departmental
oversight
and
that
of
the
administration
;
nor
*NL*
does
the
distributive
department
accept
the
product
without
its
own
*NL*
inspection
;
while
even
if
in
the
hands
of
the
consumer
an
article
*NL*
turns
out
unfit
,
the
system
enables
the
fault
to
be
traced
back
to
the
*NL*
original
workman
.
The
production
of
the
commodities
for
actual
public
*NL*
consumption
does
not
,
of
course
,
require
by
any
means
all
the
national
*NL*
force
of
workers
.
After
the
necessary
contingents
have
been
detailed
*NL*
for
the
various
industries
,
the
amount
of
labor
left
for
other
*NL*
employment
is
expended
in
creating
fixed
capital
,
such
as
buildings
,
*NL*
machinery
,
engineering
works
,
and
so
forth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
point
occurs
to
me
,
''
I
said
,
``
on
which
I
should
think
there
might
*NL*
be
dissatisfaction
.
Where
there
is
no
opportunity
for
private
*NL*
enterprise
,
how
is
there
any
assurance
that
the
claims
of
small
*NL*
minorities
of
the
people
to
have
articles
produced
,
for
which
there
is
*NL*
no
wide
demand
,
will
be
respected
?
An
official
decree
at
any
moment
*NL*
may
deprive
them
of
the
means
of
gratifying
some
special
taste
,
merely
*NL*
because
the
majority
does
not
share
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
tyranny
indeed
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
and
you
may
be
*NL*
very
sure
that
it
does
not
happen
with
us
,
to
whom
liberty
is
as
dear
*NL*
as
equality
or
fraternity
.
As
you
come
to
know
our
system
better
,
you
*NL*
will
see
that
our
officials
are
in
fact
,
and
not
merely
in
name
,
the
*NL*
agents
and
servants
of
the
people
.
The
administration
has
no
power
to
*NL*
stop
the
production
of
any
commodity
for
which
there
continues
to
be
a
*NL*
demand
.
Suppose
the
demand
for
any
article
declines
to
such
a
point
*NL*
that
its
production
becomes
very
costly
.
The
price
has
to
be
raised
in
*NL*
proportion
,
of
course
,
but
as
long
as
the
consumer
cares
to
pay
it
,
*NL*
the
production
goes
on
.
Again
,
suppose
an
article
not
before
produced
*NL*
is
demanded
.
If
the
administration
doubts
the
reality
of
the
demand
,
a
*NL*
popular
petition
guaranteeing
a
certain
basis
of
consumption
compels
*NL*
it
to
produce
the
desired
article
.
A
government
,
or
a
majority
,
which
*NL*
should
undertake
to
tell
the
people
,
or
a
minority
,
what
they
were
to
*NL*
eat
,
drink
,
or
wear
,
as
I
believe
governments
in
America
did
in
your
*NL*
day
,
would
be
regarded
as
a
curious
anachronism
indeed
.
Possibly
you
*NL*
had
reasons
for
tolerating
these
infringements
of
personal
*NL*
independence
,
but
we
should
not
think
them
endurable
.
I
am
glad
you
*NL*
raised
this
point
,
for
it
has
given
me
a
chance
to
show
you
how
much
*NL*
more
direct
and
efficient
is
the
control
over
production
exercised
by
*NL*
the
individual
citizen
now
than
it
was
in
your
day
,
when
what
you
*NL*
called
private
initiative
prevailed
,
though
it
should
have
been
*NL*
called
capitalist
initiative
,
for
the
average
private
citizen
had
*NL*
little
enough
share
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
speak
of
raising
the
price
of
costly
articles
,
''
I
said
.
``
How
can
*NL*
prices
be
regulated
in
a
country
where
there
is
no
competition
between
*NL*
buyers
or
sellers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
as
they
were
with
you
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
You
think
that
needs
*NL*
explaining
,
''
he
added
,
as
I
looked
incredulous
,
``
but
the
explanation
*NL*
need
not
be
long
;
the
cost
of
the
labor
which
produced
it
was
*NL*
recognized
as
the
legitimate
basis
of
the
price
of
an
article
in
your
*NL*
day
,
and
so
it
is
in
ours
.
In
your
day
,
it
was
the
difference
in
wages
*NL*
that
made
the
difference
in
the
cost
of
labor
;
now
it
is
the
relative
*NL*
number
of
hours
constituting
a
day
's
work
in
different
trades
,
the
*NL*
maintenance
of
the
worker
being
equal
in
all
cases
.
The
cost
of
a
*NL*
man
's
work
in
a
trade
so
difficult
that
in
order
to
attract
volunteers
*NL*
the
hours
have
to
be
fixed
at
four
a
day
is
twice
as
great
as
that
in
*NL*
a
trade
where
the
men
work
eight
hours
.
The
result
as
to
the
cost
of
*NL*
labor
,
you
see
,
is
just
the
same
as
if
the
man
working
four
hours
were
*NL*
paid
,
under
your
system
,
twice
the
wages
the
other
gets
.
This
*NL*
calculation
applied
to
the
labor
employed
in
the
various
processes
of
*NL*
a
manufactured
article
gives
its
price
relatively
to
other
articles
.
*NL*
Besides
the
cost
of
production
and
transportation
,
the
factor
of
*NL*
scarcity
affects
the
prices
of
some
commodities
.
As
regards
the
great
*NL*
staples
of
life
,
of
which
an
abundance
can
always
be
secured
,
*NL*
scarcity
is
eliminated
as
a
factor
.
There
is
always
a
large
surplus
*NL*
kept
on
hand
from
which
any
fluctuations
of
demand
or
supply
can
be
*NL*
corrected
,
even
in
most
cases
of
bad
crops
.
The
prices
of
the
staples
*NL*
grow
less
year
by
year
,
but
rarely
,
if
ever
,
rise
.
There
are
,
however
,
*NL*
certain
classes
of
articles
permanently
,
and
others
temporarily
,
*NL*
unequal
to
the
demand
,
as
,
for
example
,
fresh
fish
or
dairy
products
*NL*
in
the
latter
category
,
and
the
products
of
high
skill
and
rare
*NL*
materials
in
the
other
.
All
that
can
be
done
here
is
to
equalize
the
*NL*
inconvenience
of
the
scarcity
.
This
is
done
by
temporarily
raising
the
*NL*
price
if
the
scarcity
be
temporary
,
or
fixing
it
high
if
it
be
*NL*
permanent
.
High
prices
in
your
day
meant
restriction
of
the
articles
*NL*
affected
to
the
rich
,
but
nowadays
,
when
the
means
of
all
are
the
*NL*
same
,
the
effect
is
only
that
those
to
whom
the
articles
seem
most
*NL*
desirable
are
the
ones
who
purchase
them
.
Of
course
the
nation
,
as
any
*NL*
other
caterer
for
the
public
needs
must
be
,
is
frequently
left
with
*NL*
small
lots
of
goods
on
its
hands
by
changes
in
taste
,
unseasonable
*NL*
weather
,
and
various
other
causes
.
These
it
has
to
dispose
of
at
a
*NL*
sacrifice
just
as
merchants
often
did
in
your
day
,
charging
up
the
*NL*
loss
to
the
expenses
of
the
business
.
Owing
,
however
,
to
the
vast
body
*NL*
of
consumers
to
which
such
lots
can
be
simultaneously
offered
,
there
*NL*
is
rarely
any
difficulty
in
getting
rid
of
them
at
trifling
loss
.
I
*NL*
have
given
you
now
some
general
notion
of
our
system
of
production
,
*NL*
as
well
as
distribution
.
Do
you
find
it
as
complex
as
you
expected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
admitted
that
nothing
could
be
much
simpler
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
that
it
is
within
the
truth
to
say
that
*NL*
the
head
of
one
of
the
myriad
private
businesses
of
your
day
,
who
had
*NL*
to
maintain
sleepless
vigilance
against
the
fluctuations
of
the
*NL*
market
,
the
machinations
of
his
rivals
,
and
the
failure
of
his
*NL*
debtors
,
had
a
far
more
trying
task
than
the
group
of
men
at
*NL*
Washington
who
nowadays
direct
the
industries
of
the
entire
nation
.
*NL*
All
this
merely
shows
,
my
dear
fellow
,
how
much
easier
it
is
to
do
*NL*
things
the
right
way
than
the
wrong
.
It
is
easier
for
a
general
up
in
*NL*
a
balloon
,
with
perfect
survey
of
the
field
,
to
manoeuvre
a
million
men
*NL*
to
victory
than
for
a
sergeant
to
manage
a
platoon
in
a
thicket
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
general
of
this
army
,
including
the
flower
of
the
manhood
of
the
*NL*
nation
,
must
be
the
foremost
man
in
the
country
,
really
greater
even
*NL*
than
the
President
of
the
United
States
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
the
President
of
the
United
States
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
or
*NL*
rather
the
most
important
function
of
the
presidency
is
the
headship
*NL*
of
the
industrial
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
is
he
chosen
?
''
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
explained
to
you
before
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
when
I
was
describing
*NL*
the
force
of
the
motive
of
emulation
among
all
grades
of
the
*NL*
industrial
army
,
that
the
line
of
promotion
for
the
meritorious
lies
*NL*
through
three
grades
to
the
officer
's
grade
,
and
thence
up
through
the
*NL*
lieutenancies
to
the
captaincy
or
foremanship
,
and
superintendency
or
*NL*
colonel
's
rank
.
Next
,
with
an
intervening
grade
in
some
of
the
larger
*NL*
trades
,
come
the
general
of
the
guild
,
under
whose
immediate
control
*NL*
all
the
operations
of
the
trade
are
conducted
.
This
officer
is
at
the
*NL*
head
of
the
national
bureau
representing
his
trade
,
and
is
responsible
*NL*
for
its
work
to
the
administration
.
The
general
of
his
guild
holds
a
*NL*
splendid
position
,
and
one
which
amply
satisfies
the
ambition
of
most
*NL*
men
,
but
above
his
rank
,
which
may
be
compared
--
to
follow
the
military
*NL*
analogies
familiar
to
you
--
to
that
of
a
general
of
division
or
*NL*
major-general
,
is
that
of
the
chiefs
of
the
ten
great
departments
,
or
*NL*
groups
of
allied
trades
.
The
chiefs
of
these
ten
grand
divisions
of
*NL*
the
industrial
army
may
be
compared
to
your
commanders
of
army
corps
,
*NL*
or
lieutenant-generals
,
each
having
from
a
dozen
to
a
score
of
*NL*
generals
of
separate
guilds
reporting
to
him
.
Above
these
ten
great
*NL*
officers
,
who
form
his
council
,
is
the
general-in-chief
,
who
is
the
*NL*
President
of
the
United
States
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
general-in-chief
of
the
industrial
army
must
have
passed
through
*NL*
all
the
grades
below
him
,
from
the
common
laborers
up
.
Let
us
see
how
*NL*
he
rises
.
As
I
have
told
you
,
it
is
simply
by
the
excellence
of
his
*NL*
record
as
a
worker
that
one
rises
through
the
grades
of
the
privates
*NL*
and
becomes
a
candidate
for
a
lieutenancy
.
Through
the
lieutenancies
*NL*
he
rises
to
the
colonelcy
,
or
superintendent
's
position
,
by
*NL*
appointment
from
above
,
strictly
limited
to
the
candidates
of
the
best
*NL*
records
.
The
general
of
the
guild
appoints
to
the
ranks
under
him
,
but
*NL*
he
himself
is
not
appointed
,
but
chosen
by
suffrage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
suffrage
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
Is
not
that
ruinous
to
the
discipline
of
*NL*
the
guild
,
by
tempting
the
candidates
to
intrigue
for
the
support
of
*NL*
the
workers
under
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
it
would
be
,
no
doubt
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
if
the
workers
had
any
*NL*
suffrage
to
exercise
,
or
anything
to
say
about
the
choice
.
But
they
*NL*
have
nothing
.
Just
here
comes
in
a
peculiarity
of
our
system
.
The
*NL*
general
of
the
guild
is
chosen
from
among
the
superintendents
by
vote
*NL*
of
the
honorary
members
of
the
guild
,
that
is
,
of
those
who
have
*NL*
served
their
time
in
the
guild
and
received
their
discharge
.
As
you
*NL*
know
,
at
the
age
of
forty-five
we
are
mustered
out
of
the
army
of
*NL*
industry
,
and
have
the
residue
of
life
for
the
pursuit
of
our
own
*NL*
improvement
or
recreation
.
Of
course
,
however
,
the
associations
of
our
*NL*
active
lifetime
retain
a
powerful
hold
on
us
.
The
companionships
we
*NL*
formed
then
remain
our
companionships
till
the
end
of
life
.
We
always
*NL*
continue
honorary
members
of
our
former
guilds
,
and
retain
the
keenest
*NL*
and
most
jealous
interest
in
their
welfare
and
repute
in
the
hands
of
*NL*
the
following
generation
.
In
the
clubs
maintained
by
the
honorary
*NL*
members
of
the
several
guilds
,
in
which
we
meet
socially
,
there
are
no
*NL*
topics
of
conversation
so
common
as
those
which
relate
to
these
*NL*
matters
,
and
the
young
aspirants
for
guild
leadership
who
can
pass
the
*NL*
criticism
of
us
old
fellows
are
likely
to
be
pretty
well
equipped
.
*NL*
Recognizing
this
fact
,
the
nation
entrusts
to
the
honorary
members
of
*NL*
each
guild
the
election
of
its
general
,
and
I
venture
to
claim
that
no
*NL*
previous
form
of
society
could
have
developed
a
body
of
electors
so
*NL*
ideally
adapted
to
their
office
,
as
regards
absolute
impartiality
,
*NL*
knowledge
of
the
special
qualifications
and
record
of
candidates
,
*NL*
solicitude
for
the
best
result
,
and
complete
absence
of
self-interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Each
of
the
ten
lieutenant-generals
or
heads
of
departments
is
*NL*
himself
elected
from
among
the
generals
of
the
guilds
grouped
as
a
*NL*
department
,
by
vote
of
the
honorary
members
of
the
guilds
thus
*NL*
grouped
.
Of
course
there
is
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
each
guild
to
*NL*
vote
for
its
own
general
,
but
no
guild
of
any
group
has
nearly
enough
*NL*
votes
to
elect
a
man
not
supported
by
most
of
the
others
.
I
assure
you
*NL*
that
these
elections
are
exceedingly
lively
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
President
,
I
suppose
,
is
selected
from
among
the
ten
heads
of
the
*NL*
great
departments
,
''
I
suggested
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Precisely
,
but
the
heads
of
departments
are
not
eligible
to
the
*NL*
presidency
till
they
have
been
a
certain
number
of
years
out
of
*NL*
office
.
It
is
rarely
that
a
man
passes
through
all
the
grades
to
the
*NL*
headship
of
a
department
much
before
he
is
forty
,
and
at
the
end
of
a
*NL*
five
years
'
term
he
is
usually
forty-five
.
If
more
,
he
still
serves
*NL*
through
his
term
,
and
if
less
,
he
is
nevertheless
discharged
from
the
*NL*
industrial
army
at
its
termination
.
It
would
not
do
for
him
to
return
*NL*
to
the
ranks
.
The
interval
before
he
is
a
candidate
for
the
presidency
*NL*
is
intended
to
give
time
for
him
to
recognize
fully
that
he
has
*NL*
returned
into
the
general
mass
of
the
nation
,
and
is
identified
with
*NL*
it
rather
than
with
the
industrial
army
.
Moreover
,
it
is
expected
that
*NL*
he
will
employ
this
period
in
studying
the
general
condition
of
the
*NL*
army
,
instead
of
that
of
the
special
group
of
guilds
of
which
he
was
*NL*
the
head
.
From
among
the
former
heads
of
departments
who
may
be
*NL*
eligible
at
the
time
,
the
President
is
elected
by
vote
of
all
the
men
*NL*
of
the
nation
who
are
not
connected
with
the
industrial
army
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
army
is
not
allowed
to
vote
for
President
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
not
.
That
would
be
perilous
to
its
discipline
,
which
it
is
*NL*
the
business
of
the
President
to
maintain
as
the
representative
of
the
*NL*
nation
at
large
.
His
right
hand
for
this
purpose
is
the
inspectorate
,
*NL*
a
highly
important
department
of
our
system
;
to
the
inspectorate
come
*NL*
all
complaints
or
information
as
to
defects
in
goods
,
insolence
or
*NL*
inefficiency
of
officials
,
or
dereliction
of
any
sort
in
the
public
*NL*
service
.
The
inspectorate
,
however
,
does
not
wait
for
complaints
.
Not
*NL*
only
is
it
on
the
alert
to
catch
and
sift
every
rumor
of
a
fault
in
*NL*
the
service
,
but
it
is
its
business
,
by
systematic
and
constant
*NL*
oversight
and
inspection
of
every
branch
of
the
army
,
to
find
out
what
*NL*
is
going
wrong
before
anybody
else
does
.
The
President
is
usually
not
*NL*
far
from
fifty
when
elected
,
and
serves
five
years
,
forming
an
*NL*
honorable
exception
to
the
rule
of
retirement
at
forty-five
.
At
the
*NL*
end
of
his
term
of
office
,
a
national
Congress
is
called
to
receive
*NL*
his
report
and
approve
or
condemn
it
.
If
it
is
approved
,
Congress
*NL*
usually
elects
him
to
represent
the
nation
for
five
years
more
in
the
*NL*
international
council
.
Congress
,
I
should
also
say
,
passes
on
the
*NL*
reports
of
the
outgoing
heads
of
departments
,
and
a
disapproval
*NL*
renders
any
one
of
them
ineligible
for
President
.
But
it
is
rare
,
*NL*
indeed
,
that
the
nation
has
occasion
for
other
sentiments
than
those
*NL*
of
gratitude
toward
its
high
officers
.
As
to
their
ability
,
to
have
*NL*
risen
from
the
ranks
,
by
tests
so
various
and
severe
,
to
their
*NL*
positions
,
is
proof
in
itself
of
extraordinary
qualities
,
while
as
to
*NL*
faithfulness
,
our
social
system
leaves
them
absolutely
without
any
*NL*
other
motive
than
that
of
winning
the
esteem
of
their
fellow
citizens
.
*NL*
Corruption
is
impossible
in
a
society
where
there
is
neither
poverty
*NL*
to
be
bribed
nor
wealth
to
bribe
,
while
as
to
demagoguery
or
intrigue
*NL*
for
office
,
the
conditions
of
promotion
render
them
out
of
the
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
point
I
do
not
quite
understand
,
''
I
said
.
``
Are
the
members
of
the
*NL*
liberal
professions
eligible
to
the
presidency
?
and
if
so
,
how
are
*NL*
they
ranked
with
those
who
pursue
the
industries
proper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
have
no
ranking
with
them
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
The
members
of
*NL*
the
technical
professions
,
such
as
engineers
and
architects
,
have
a
*NL*
ranking

constructive
guilds
;
but
the
members
of
the
liberal
*NL*
professions

the
doctors

teachers
,
as
well

the
artists

men
*NL*
of
letters

obtain
remissions

not

industrial
army

On
this
ground
they
vote
for

not

One
of
its
main
duties
being
the
*NL*
control

discipline
of
the
industrial
army
,
it
is
essential
that

reasonable

I
said

``
No

the

nothing

some
time
after
the
ladies
had
retired
,
*NL*
talking
with
Dr.
Leete
about
the
effect
of
the
plan
of
exempting
men
*NL*
from
further
service
to
the
nation
after
the
age
of
forty-five
,
a
*NL*
point
brought
up
by
his
account
of
the
part
taken
by
the
retired
*NL*
citizens
in
the
government
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
forty-five
,
''
said
I
,
``
a
man
still
has
ten
years
of
good
manual
*NL*
labor
in
him
,
and
twice
ten
years
of
good
intellectual
service
.
To
be
*NL*
superannuated
at
that
age
and
laid
on
the
shelf
must
be
regarded
*NL*
rather
as
a
hardship
than
a
favor
by
men
of
energetic
dispositions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Mr.
West
,
''
exclaimed
Dr.
Leete
,
beaming
upon
me
,
``
you
can
not
*NL*
have
any
idea
of
the
piquancy
your
nineteenth
century
ideas
have
for
*NL*
us
of
this
day
,
the
rare
quaintness
of
their
effect
.
Know
,
O
child
of
*NL*
another
race
and
yet
the
same
,
that
the
labor
we
have
to
render
as
our
*NL*
part
in
securing
for
the
nation
the
means
of
a
comfortable
physical
*NL*
existence
is
by
no
means
regarded
as
the
most
important
,
the
most
*NL*
interesting
,
or
the
most
dignified
employment
of
our
powers
.
We
look
*NL*
upon
it
as
a
necessary
duty
to
be
discharged
before
we
can
fully
*NL*
devote
ourselves
to
the
higher
exercise
of
our
faculties
,
the
*NL*
intellectual
and
spiritual
enjoyments
and
pursuits
which
alone
mean
*NL*
life
.
Everything
possible
is
indeed
done
by
the
just
distribution
of
*NL*
burdens
,
and
by
all
manner
of
special
attractions
and
incentives
to
*NL*
relieve
our
labor
of
irksomeness
,
and
,
except
in
a
comparative
sense
,
*NL*
it
is
not
usually
irksome
,
and
is
often
inspiring
.
But
it
is
not
our
*NL*
labor
,
but
the
higher
and
larger
activities
which
the
performance
of
*NL*
our
task
will
leave
us
free
to
enter
upon
,
that
are
considered
the
*NL*
main
business
of
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
all
,
nor
the
majority
,
have
those
scientific
,
artistic
,
*NL*
literary
,
or
scholarly
interests
which
make
leisure
the
one
thing
*NL*
valuable
to
their
possessors
.
Many
look
upon
the
last
half
of
life
*NL*
chiefly
as
a
period
for
enjoyment
of
other
sorts
;
for
travel
,
for
*NL*
social
relaxation
in
the
company
of
their
lifetime
friends
;
a
time
*NL*
for
the
cultivation
of
all
manner
of
personal
idiosyncrasies
and
*NL*
special
tastes
,
and
the
pursuit
of
every
imaginable
form
of
*NL*
recreation
;
in
a
word
,
a
time
for
the
leisurely
and
unperturbed
*NL*
appreciation
of
the
good
things
of
the
world
which
they
have
helped
to
*NL*
create
.
But
whatever
the
differences
between
our
individual
tastes
as
*NL*
to
the
use
we
shall
put
our
leisure
to
,
we
all
agree
in
looking
*NL*
forward
to
the
date
of
our
discharge
as
the
time
when
we
shall
first
*NL*
enter
upon
the
full
enjoyment
of
our
birthright
,
the
period
when
we
*NL*
shall
first
really
attain
our
majority
and
become
enfranchised
from
*NL*
discipline
and
control
,
with
the
fee
of
our
lives
vested
in
*NL*
ourselves
.
As
eager
boys
in
your
day
anticipated
twenty-one
,
so
men
*NL*
nowadays
look
forward
to
forty-five
.
At
twenty-one
we
become
men
,
but
*NL*
at
forty-five
we
renew
youth
.
Middle
age
and
what
you
would
have
*NL*
called
old
age
are
considered
,
rather
than
youth
,
the
enviable
time
of
*NL*
life
.
Thanks
to
the
better
conditions
of
existence
nowadays
,
and
above
*NL*
all
the
freedom
of
every
one
from
care
,
old
age
approaches
many
years
*NL*
later
and
has
an
aspect
far
more
benign
than
in
past
times
.
Persons
of
*NL*
average
constitution
usually
live
to
eighty-five
or
ninety
,
and
at
*NL*
forty-five
we
are
physically
and
mentally
younger
,
I
fancy
,
than
you
*NL*
were
at
thirty-five
.
It
is
a
strange
reflection
that
at
forty-five
,
*NL*
when
we
are
just
entering
upon
the
most
enjoyable
period
of
life
,
you
*NL*
already
began
to
think
of
growing
old
and
to
look
backward
.
With
you
*NL*
it
was
the
forenoon
,
with
us
it
is
the
afternoon
,
which
is
the
*NL*
brighter
half
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
I
remember
that
our
talk
branched
into
the
subject
of
*NL*
popular
sports
and
recreations
at
the
present
time
as
compared
with
*NL*
those
of
the
nineteenth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
one
respect
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
there
is
a
marked
difference
.
The
*NL*
professional
sportsmen
,
which
were
such
a
curious
feature
of
your
day
,
*NL*
we
have
nothing
answering
to
,
nor
are
the
prizes
for
which
our
*NL*
athletes
contend
money
prizes
,
as
with
you
.
Our
contests
are
always
*NL*
for
glory
only
.
The
generous
rivalry
existing
between
the
various
*NL*
guilds
,
and
the
loyalty
of
each
worker
to
his
own
,
afford
a
constant
*NL*
stimulation
to
all
sorts
of
games
and
matches
by
sea
and
land
,
in
*NL*
which
the
young
men
take
scarcely
more
interest
than
the
honorary
*NL*
guildsmen
who
have
served
their
time
.
The
guild
yacht
races
off
*NL*
Marblehead
take
place
next
week
,
and
you
will
be
able
to
judge
for
*NL*
yourself
of
the
popular
enthusiasm
which
such
events
nowadays
call
out
*NL*
as
compared
with
your
day
.
The
demand
for
'
_
panem
et
circenses
_
'
*NL*
preferred
by
the
Roman
populace
is
recognized
nowadays
as
a
wholly
*NL*
reasonable
one
.
If
bread
is
the
first
necessity
of
life
,
recreation
is
*NL*
a
close
second
,
and
the
nation
caters
for
both
.
Americans
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
were
as
unfortunate
in
lacking
an
adequate
*NL*
provision
for
the
one
sort
of
need
as
for
the
other
.
Even
if
the
*NL*
people
of
that
period
had
enjoyed
larger
leisure
they
would
,
I
fancy
,
*NL*
have
often
been
at
a
loss
how
to
pass
it
agreeably
.
We
are
never
in
*NL*
that
predicament
.

CHAPTER
XIX
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
course
of
an
early
morning
constitutional
I
visited
*NL*
Charlestown
.
Among
the
changes
,
too
numerous
to
attempt
to
indicate
,
*NL*
which
mark
the
lapse
of
a
century
in
that
quarter
,
I
particularly
*NL*
noted
the
total
disappearance
of
the
old
state
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
went
before
my
day
,
but
I
remember
hearing
about
it
,
''
said
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
,
when
I
alluded
to
the
fact
at
the
breakfast
table
.
``
We
have
no
*NL*
jails
nowadays
.
All
cases
of
atavism
are
treated
in
the
hospitals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
atavism
!
''
I
exclaimed
,
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
yes
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
The
idea
of
dealing
punitively
with
*NL*
those
unfortunates
was
given
up
at
least
fifty
years
ago
,
and
I
think
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
understand
you
,
''
I
said
.
``
Atavism
in
my
day
was
a
word
*NL*
applied
to
the
cases
of
persons
in
whom
some
trait
of
a
remote
*NL*
ancestor
recurred
in
a
noticeable
manner
.
Am
I
to
understand
that
*NL*
crime
is
nowadays
looked
upon
as
the
recurrence
of
an
ancestral
*NL*
trait
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
with
a
smile
half
humorous
,
half
*NL*
deprecating
,
``
but
since
you
have
so
explicitly
asked
the
question
,
I
*NL*
am
forced
to
say
that
the
fact
is
precisely
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
what
I
had
already
learned
of
the
moral
contrasts
between
the
*NL*
nineteenth
and
the
twentieth
centuries
,
it
was
doubtless
absurd
in
me
*NL*
to
begin
to
develop
sensitiveness
on
the
subject
,
and
probably
if
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
had
not
spoken
with
that
apologetic
air
and
Mrs.
Leete
and
Edith
*NL*
shown
a
corresponding
embarrassment
,
I
should
not
have
flushed
,
as
I
*NL*
was
conscious
I
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
not
in
much
danger
of
being
vain
of
my
generation
before
,
''
I
*NL*
said
;
``
but
,
really
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
your
generation
,
Mr.
West
,
''
interposed
Edith
.
``
It
is
the
one
*NL*
in
which
you
are
living
,
you
know
,
and
it
is
only
because
we
are
alive
*NL*
now
that
we
call
it
ours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
I
will
try
to
think
of
it
so
,
''
I
said
,
and
as
my
eyes
met
*NL*
hers
their
expression
quite
cured
my
senseless
sensitiveness
.
``
After
*NL*
all
,
''
I
said
,
with
a
laugh
,
``
I
was
brought
up
a
Calvinist
,
and
ought
*NL*
not
to
be
startled
to
hear
crime
spoken
of
as
an
ancestral
trait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
point
of
fact
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
our
use
of
the
word
is
no
*NL*
reflection
at
all
on
your
generation
,
if
,
begging
Edith
's
pardon
,
we
*NL*
may
call
it
yours
,
so
far
as
seeming
to
imply
that
we
think
ourselves
,
*NL*
apart
from
our
circumstances
,
better
than
you
were
.
In
your
day
fully
*NL*
nineteen
twentieths
of
the
crime
,
using
the
word
broadly
to
include
*NL*
all
sorts
of
misdemeanors
,
resulted
from
the
inequality
in
the
*NL*
possessions
of
individuals
;
want
tempted
the
poor
,
lust
of
greater
*NL*
gains
,
or
the
desire
to
preserve
former
gains
,
tempted
the
well-to-do
.
*NL*
Directly
or
indirectly
,
the
desire
for
money
,
which
then
meant
every
*NL*
good
thing
,
was
the
motive
of
all
this
crime
,
the
taproot
of
a
vast
*NL*
poison
growth
,
which
the
machinery
of
law
,
courts
,
and
police
could
*NL*
barely
prevent
from
choking
your
civilization
outright
.
When
we
made
*NL*
the
nation
the
sole
trustee
of
the
wealth
of
the
people
,
and
*NL*
guaranteed
to
all
abundant
maintenance
,
on
the
one
hand
abolishing
*NL*
want
,
and
on
the
other
checking
the
accumulation
of
riches
,
we
cut
*NL*
this
root
,
and
the
poison
tree
that
overshadowed
your
society
*NL*
withered
,
like
Jonah
's
gourd
,
in
a
day
.
As
for
the
comparatively
small
*NL*
class
of
violent
crimes
against
persons
,
unconnected
with
any
idea
of
*NL*
gain
,
they
were
almost
wholly
confined
,
even
in
your
day
,
to
the
*NL*
ignorant
and
bestial
;
and
in
these
days
,
when
education
and
good
*NL*
manners
are
not
the
monopoly
of
a
few
,
but
universal
,
such
atrocities
*NL*
are
scarcely
ever
heard
of
.
You
now
see
why
the
word
``
atavism
''
is
used
*NL*
for
crime
.
It
is
because
nearly
all
forms
of
crime
known
to
you
are
*NL*
motiveless
now
,
and
when
they
appear
can
only
be
explained
as
the
*NL*
outcropping
of
ancestral
traits
.
You
used
to
call
persons
who
stole
,
*NL*
evidently
without
any
rational
motive
,
kleptomaniacs
,
and
when
the
*NL*
case
was
clear
deemed
it
absurd
to
punish
them
as
thieves
.
Your
*NL*
attitude
toward
the
genuine
kleptomaniac
is
precisely
ours
toward
the
*NL*
victim
of
atavism
,
an
attitude
of
compassion
and
firm
but
gentle
*NL*
restraint
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
courts
must
have
an
easy
time
of
it
,
''
I
observed
.
``
With
no
*NL*
private
property
to
speak
of
,
no
disputes
between
citizens
over
*NL*
business
relations
,
no
real
estate
to
divide
or
debts
to
collect
,
*NL*
there
must
be
absolutely
no
civil
business
at
all
for
them
;
and
with
*NL*
no
offenses
against
property
,
and
mighty
few
of
any
sort
to
provide
*NL*
criminal
cases
,
I
should
think
you
might
almost
do
without
judges
and
*NL*
lawyers
altogether
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
without
the
lawyers
,
certainly
,
''
was
Dr.
Leete
's
reply
.
``
It
*NL*
would
not
seem
reasonable
to
us
,
in
a
case
where
the
only
interest
of
*NL*
the
nation
is
to
find
out
the
truth
,
that
persons
should
take
part
in
*NL*
the
proceedings
who
had
an
acknowledged
motive
to
color
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
who
defends
the
accused
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
is
a
criminal
he
needs
no
defense
,
for
he
pleads
guilty
in
most
*NL*
instances
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
The
plea
of
the
accused
is
not
a
mere
*NL*
formality
with
us
,
as
with
you
.
It
is
usually
the
end
of
the
case
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
mean
that
the
man
who
pleads
not
guilty
is
thereupon
*NL*
discharged
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
mean
that
.
He
is
not
accused
on
light
grounds
,
and
if
he
*NL*
denies
his
guilt
,
must
still
be
tried
.
But
trials
are
few
,
for
in
most
*NL*
cases
the
guilty
man
pleads
guilty
.
When
he
makes
a
false
plea
and
is
*NL*
clearly
proved
guilty
,
his
penalty
is
doubled
.
Falsehood
is
,
however
,
*NL*
so
despised
among
us
that
few
offenders
would
lie
to
save
themselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
most
astounding
thing
you
have
yet
told
me
,
''
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
``
If
lying
has
gone
out
of
fashion
,
this
is
indeed
the
`
new
heavens
and
*NL*
the
new
earth
wherein
dwelleth
righteousness
,
'
which
the
prophet
*NL*
foretold
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Such
is
,
in
fact
,
the
belief
of
some
persons
nowadays
,
''
was
the
*NL*
doctor
's
answer
.
``
They
hold
that
we
have
entered
upon
the
millennium
,
*NL*
and
the
theory
from
their
point
of
view
does
not
lack
plausibility
.
*NL*
But
as
to
your
astonishment
at
finding
that
the
world
has
outgrown
*NL*
lying
,
there
is
really
no
ground
for
it
.
Falsehood
,
even
in
your
day
,
*NL*
was
not
common
between
gentlemen
and
ladies
,
social
equals
.
The
lie
of
*NL*
fear
was
the
refuge
of
cowardice
,
and
the
lie
of
fraud
the
device
of
*NL*
the
cheat
.
The
inequalities
of
men
and
the
lust
of
acquisition
offered
*NL*
a
constant
premium
on
lying
at
that
time
.
Yet
even
then
,
the
man
who
*NL*
neither
feared
another
nor
desired
to
defraud
him
scorned
falsehood
.
*NL*
Because
we
are
now
all
social
equals
,
and
no
man
either
has
anything
*NL*
to
fear
from
another
or
can
gain
anything
by
deceiving
him
,
the
*NL*
contempt
of
falsehood
is
so
universal
that
it
is
rarely
,
as
I
told
*NL*
you
,
that
even
a
criminal
in
other
respects
will
be
found
willing
to
*NL*
lie
.
When
,
however
,
a
plea
of
not
guilty
is
returned
,
the
judge
*NL*
appoints
two
colleagues
to
state
the
opposite
sides
of
the
case
.
How
*NL*
far
these
men
are
from
being
like
your
hired
advocates
and
*NL*
prosecutors
,
determined
to
acquit
or
convict
,
may
appear
from
the
fact
*NL*
that
unless
both
agree
that
the
verdict
found
is
just
,
the
case
is
*NL*
tried
over
,
while
anything
like
bias
in
the
tone
of
either
of
the
*NL*
judges
stating
the
case
would
be
a
shocking
scandal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
understand
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
it
is
a
judge
who
states
each
side
of
*NL*
the
case
as
well
as
a
judge
who
hears
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
The
judges
take
turns
in
serving
on
the
bench
and
at
the
*NL*
bar
,
and
are
expected
to
maintain
the
judicial
temper
equally
whether
*NL*
in
stating
or
deciding
a
case
.
The
system
is
indeed
in
effect
that
of
*NL*
trial
by
three
judges
occupying
different
points
of
view
as
to
the
*NL*
case
.
When
they
agree
upon
a
verdict
,
we
believe
it
to
be
as
near
to
*NL*
absolute
truth
as
men
well
can
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
given
up
the
jury
system

then
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
well
enough
as
a
corrective
in
the
days
of
hired
advocates
,
*NL*
and
a
bench
sometimes
venal
,
and
often
with
a
tenure
that
made
it
*NL*
dependent
,
but
is
needless
now
.
No
conceivable
motive
but
justice
*NL*
could
actuate
our
judges
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
these
magistrates
selected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
an
honorable
exception
to
the
rule
which
discharges
all
men
*NL*
from
service
at
the
age
of
forty-five
.
The
President
of
the
nation
*NL*
appoints
the
necessary
judges
year
by
year
from
the
class
reaching
*NL*
that
age
.
The
number
appointed
is
,
of
course
,
exceedingly
few
,
and
*NL*
the
honor
so
high
that
it
is
held
an
offset
to
the
additional
term
of
*NL*
service
which
follows
,
and
though
a
judge
's
appointment
may
be
*NL*
declined
,
it
rarely
is

The
term
is
five
years
,
without
eligibility

reappointment

The
members
of
the
Supreme
Court
,
which
is
the
guardian

of
the

are
selected
from
among
the

vacancy
in
that
court
occurs
,
those
of
the
lower
judges

expire
that
year

select
,
as
their
last
official
act
,
the
one
of
their
*NL*
colleagues
left
on
the
bench
whom
they
deem
fittest
to
fill
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
being
no
legal
profession
to
serve
as
a
school
for
judges
,
''
I
*NL*
said
,
``
they
must
,
of
course
,
come
directly
from
the
law
school
to
the
*NL*
bench

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
no
such
things
as
law
schools
,
''
replied
the
doctor
,
smiling
.
*NL*
``
The
law
as
a
special
science
is
obsolete
.
It
was
a
system
of
*NL*
casuistry
which
the
elaborate
artificiality
of
the
old
order
of
*NL*
society
absolutely
required
to
interpret
it
,
but
only
a
few
of
the
*NL*
plainest
and
simplest
legal
maxims
have
any
application
to
the
*NL*
existing
state
of
the
world
.
Everything
touching
the
relations
of
men
*NL*
to
one
another
is
now
simpler
,
beyond
any
comparison
,
than
in
your
*NL*
day
.
We
should
have
no
sort
of
use
for
the
hair-splitting
experts
who
*NL*
presided
and
argued
in
your
courts
.
You
must
not
imagine
,
however
,
*NL*
that
we
have
any
disrespect
for
those
ancient
worthies
because
we
have
*NL*
no
use
for
them
.
On
the
contrary
,
we
entertain
an
unfeigned
respect
,
*NL*
amounting
almost
to
awe
,
for
the
men
who
alone
understood
and
were
*NL*
able
to
expound
the
interminable
complexity
of
the
rights
of
property
,
*NL*
and
the
relations
of
commercial
and
personal
dependence
involved
in
*NL*
your
system
.
What
,
indeed
,
could
possibly
give
a
more
powerful
*NL*
impression
of
the
intricacy
and
artificiality
of
that
system
than
the
*NL*
fact
that
it
was
necessary
to
set
apart
from
other
pursuits
the
cream
*NL*
of
the
intellect
of
every
generation
,
in
order
to
provide
a
body
of
*NL*
pundits
able
to
make
it
even
vaguely
intelligible
to
those
whose
fates
*NL*
it
determined
.
The
treatises
of
your
great
lawyers
,
the
works
of
*NL*
Blackstone
and
Chitty
,
of
Story
and
Parsons
,
stand
in
our
museums
,
*NL*
side
by
side
with
the
tomes
of
Duns
Scotus
and
his
fellow
scholastics
,
*NL*
as
curious
monuments
of
intellectual
subtlety
devoted
to
subjects
*NL*
equally
remote
from
the
interests
of
modern
men
.
Our
judges
are
simply
*NL*
widely
informed
,
judicious
,
and
discreet
men
of
ripe
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
fail
to
speak
of
one
important
function
of
the
minor
*NL*
judges
,
''
added
Dr.
Leete
.
``
This
is
to
adjudicate
all
cases
where
a
*NL*
private
of
the
industrial
army
makes
a
complaint
of
unfairness
against
*NL*
an
officer
.
All
such
questions
are
heard
and
settled
without
appeal
by
*NL*
a
single
judge
,
three
judges
being
required
only
in
graver
cases
.
The
*NL*
efficiency
of
industry
requires
the
strictest
discipline
in
the
army
*NL*
of
labor
,
but
the
claim
of
the
workman
to
just
and
considerate
*NL*
treatment
is
backed
by
the
whole
power
of
the
nation
.
The
officer
*NL*
commands
and
the
private
obeys
,
but
no
officer
is
so
high
that
he
*NL*
would
dare
display
an
overbearing
manner
toward
a
workman
of
the
*NL*
lowest
class
.
As
for
churlishness
or
rudeness
by
an
official
of
any
*NL*
sort
,
in
his
relations
to
the
public
,
not
one
among
minor
offenses
is
*NL*
more
sure
of
a
prompt
penalty
than
this
.
Not
only
justice
but
civility
*NL*
is
enforced
by
our
judges
in
all
sorts
of
intercourse
.
No
value
of
*NL*
service
is
accepted
as
a
set-off
to
boorish
or
offensive
manners
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
me
,
as
Dr.
Leete
was
speaking
,
that
in
all
his
talk
I
*NL*
had
heard
much
of
the
nation
and
nothing
of
the
state
governments
.
Had
*NL*
the
organization
of
the
nation
as
an
industrial
unit
done
away
with
*NL*
the
states
?
I
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Necessarily
,
''
he
replied
.
``
The
state
governments
would
have
*NL*
interfered
with
the
control
and
discipline
of
the
industrial
army
,
*NL*
which
,
of
course
,
required
to
be
central
and
uniform
.
Even
if
the
*NL*
state
governments
had
not
become
inconvenient
for
other
reasons
,
they
*NL*
were
rendered
superfluous
by
the
prodigious
simplification
in
the
task
*NL*
of
government
since
your
day
.
Almost
the
sole
function
of
the
*NL*
administration
now
is
that
of
directing
the
industries
of
the
country
.
*NL*
Most
of
the
purposes
for
which
governments
formerly
existed
no
longer
*NL*
remain
to
be
subserved
.
We
have
no
army
or
navy
,
and
no
military
*NL*
organization
.
We
have
no
departments
of
state
or
treasury
,
no
excise
*NL*
or
revenue
services
,
no
taxes
or
tax
collectors
.
The
only
function
*NL*
proper
of
government
,
as
known
to
you
,
which
still
remains
,
is
the
*NL*
judiciary
and
police
system
.
I
have
already
explained
to
you
how
*NL*
simple
is
our
judicial
system
as
compared
with
your
huge
and
complex
*NL*
machine
.
Of
course
the
same
absence
of
crime
and
temptation
to
it
,
*NL*
which
make
the
duties
of
judges
so
light
,
reduces
the
number
and
*NL*
duties
of
the
police
to
a
minimum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
with
no
state
legislatures
,
and
Congress
meeting
only
once
in
*NL*
five
years
,
how
do
you
get
your
legislation
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
no
legislation
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
that
is
,
next
to
none
.
*NL*
It
is
rarely
that
Congress
,
even
when
it
meets
,
considers
any
new
laws
*NL*
of
consequence
,
and
then
it
only
has
power
to
commend
them
to
the
*NL*
following
Congress
,
lest
anything
be
done
hastily
.
If
you
will
*NL*
consider
a
moment
,
Mr.
West
,
you
will
see
that
we
have
nothing
to
make
*NL*
laws
about
.
The
fundamental
principles
on
which
our
society
is
founded
*NL*
settle
for
all
time
the
strifes
and
misunderstandings
which
in
your
*NL*
day
called
for
legislation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fully
ninety-nine
hundredths
of
the
laws
of
that
time
concerned
the
*NL*
definition
and
protection
of
private
property
and
the
relations
of
*NL*
buyers
and
sellers
.
There
is
neither
private
property
,
beyond
personal
*NL*
belongings
,
now
,
nor
buying
and
selling
,
and
therefore
the
occasion
of
*NL*
nearly
all
the
legislation
formerly
necessary
has
passed
away
.
*NL*
Formerly
,
society
was
a
pyramid
poised
on
its
apex
.
All
the
*NL*
gravitations
of
human
nature
were
constantly
tending
to
topple
it
*NL*
over
,
and
it
could
be
maintained
upright
,
or
rather
upwrong
-LRB-
if
you
*NL*
will
pardon
the
feeble
witticism
-RRB-
,
by
an
elaborate
system
of
*NL*
constantly
renewed
props
and
buttresses
and
guy-ropes
in
the
form
of
*NL*
laws
.
A
central
Congress
and
forty
state
legislatures
,
turning
out
*NL*
some
twenty
thousand
laws
a
year
,
could
not
make
new
props
fast
enough
*NL*
to
take
the
place
of
those
which
were
constantly
breaking
down
or
*NL*
becoming
ineffectual
through
some
shifting
of
the
strain
.
Now
society
*NL*
rests
on
its
base
,
and
is
in
as
little
need
of
artificial
supports
as
*NL*
the
everlasting
hills
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
at
least
municipal
governments
besides
the
one
central
*NL*
authority
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
and
they
have
important
and
extensive
functions
in
looking
*NL*
out
for
the
public
comfort
and
recreation
,
and
the
improvement
and
*NL*
embellishment
of
the
villages
and
cities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
having
no
control
over
the
labor
of
their
people
,
or
means
of
*NL*
hiring
it
,
how
can
they
do
anything
?

``
Every
town

public
works

a
certain
proportion
of
the
quota
of
labor
its
citizens
*NL*
contribute
to
the
nation

This
proportion

CHAPTER
XX

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
Edith
casually
inquired
if
I
had
yet
revisited
the
*NL*
underground
chamber
in
the
garden
in
which
I
had
been
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet

''
I
replied
.
``
To
be
frank
,
I
have
shrunk
thus
far
from
doing
*NL*
so
,
lest
the
visit
might
revive
old
associations
rather
too
strongly
*NL*
for
my
mental
equilibrium
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
!
''
she
said
,
``
I
can
imagine
that
you
have
done
well
to
stay
*NL*
away
.
I
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
am
glad
you
spoke
of
it
.
The
danger
,
if
there
was
*NL*
any
,
existed
only
during
the
first
day
or
two
.
Thanks
to
you
,
chiefly
*NL*
and
always
,
I
feel
my
footing
now
so
firm
in
this
new
world
,
that
if
*NL*
you
will
go
with
me
to
keep
the
ghosts
off
,
I
should
really
like
to
*NL*
visit
the
place
this
afternoon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edith
demurred
at
first
,
but
,
finding
that
I
was
in
earnest
,
consented
*NL*
to
accompany
me
.
The
rampart
of
earth
thrown
up
from
the
excavation
*NL*
was
visible
among
the
trees
from
the
house
,
and
a
few
steps
brought
us
*NL*
to
the
spot
.
All
remained
as
it
was
at
the
point
when
work
was
*NL*
interrupted
by
the
discovery
of
the
tenant
of
the
chamber
,
save
that
*NL*
the
door
had
been
opened
and
the
slab
from
the
roof
replaced
.
*NL*
Descending
the
sloping
sides
of
the
excavation
,
we
went
in
at
the
door
*NL*
and
stood
within
the
dimly-lighted
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
just
as
I
had
beheld
it
last
on
that
evening
one
*NL*
hundred
and
thirteen
years
previous
,
just
before
closing
my
eyes
for
*NL*
that
long
sleep
.
I
stood
for
some
time
silently
looking
about
me
.
I
*NL*
saw
that
my
companion
was
furtively
regarding
me
with
an
expression
of
*NL*
awed
and
sympathetic
curiosity
.
I
put
out
my
hand
to
her
and
she
*NL*
placed
hers
in
it
,
the
soft
fingers
responding
with
a
reassuring
*NL*
pressure
to
my
clasp
.
Finally
she
whispered
,
``
Had
we
not
better
go
out
*NL*
now
?
You
must
not
try
yourself
too
far
.
Oh
,
how
strange
it
must
be
to
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
''
I
replied
,
``
it
does
not
seem
strange
;
that
is
the
*NL*
strangest
part
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
strange
?
''
she
echoed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
so
,
''
I
replied
.
``
The
emotions
with
which
you
evidently
credit
*NL*
me
,
and
which
I
anticipated
would
attend
this
visit
,
I
simply
do
not
*NL*
feel
.
I
realize
all
that
these
surroundings
suggest
,
but
without
the
*NL*
agitation
I
expected
.
You
ca
n't
be
nearly
as
much
surprised
at
this
as
*NL*
I
am
myself
.
Ever
since
that
terrible
morning
when
you
came
to
my
*NL*
help
,
I
have
tried
to
avoid
thinking
of
my
former
life
,
just
as
I
have
*NL*
avoided
coming
here
,
for
fear
of
the
agitating
effects
.
I
am
for
all
*NL*
the
world
like
a
man
who
has
permitted
an
injured
limb
to
lie
*NL*
motionless
under
the
impression
that
it
is
exquisitely
sensitive
,
and
*NL*
on
trying
to
move
it
finds
that
it
is
paralyzed

``
Do
you
mean
your
memory
is
gone

*NL*

``
Not
at
all

I
remember
everything
connected
with
my
former
life
,

*NL*
with
a
total
lack
of
keen
sensation
.
I
remember
it
for
clearness
as
if
*NL*
it
had
been
but
a
day
since
then
,
but
my
feelings
about
what
I
*NL*
remember
are
as
faint
as
if
to
my
consciousness
,
as
well
as
in
fact
,
a
*NL*
hundred
years
had
intervened
.
Perhaps
it
is
possible
to
explain
this
,
*NL*
too
.
The
effect
of
change
in
surroundings
is
like
that
of
lapse
of
*NL*
time
in
making
the
past
seem
remote
.
When
I
first
woke
from
that
*NL*
trance
,
my
former
life
appeared
as
yesterday
,
but
now
,
since
I
have
*NL*
learned
to
know
my
new
surroundings
,
and
to
realize
the
prodigious
*NL*
changes
that
have
transformed
the
world
,
I
no
longer
find
it
hard
,
but
*NL*
very
easy
,
to
realize
that
I
have
slept
a
century
.
Can
you
conceive
of
*NL*
such
a
thing
as
living
a
hundred
years
in
four
days
?
It
really
seems
*NL*
to
me
that
I
have
done
just
that
,
and
that
it
is
this
experience
which
*NL*
has
given
so
remote
and
unreal
an
appearance
to
my
former
life
.
Can
*NL*
you
see
how
such
a
thing
might
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
conceive
it
,
''
replied
Edith
,
meditatively
,
``
and
I
think
we
*NL*
ought
all
to
be
thankful
that
it
is
so
,
for
it
will
save
you
much
*NL*
suffering
,
I
am
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Imagine
,
''
I
said
,
in
an
effort
to
explain
,
as
much
to
myself
as
to
*NL*
her
,
the
strangeness
of
my
mental
condition
,
``
that
a
man
first
heard
*NL*
of
a
bereavement
many
,
many
years
,
half
a
lifetime
perhaps
,
after
the
*NL*
event
occurred
.
I
fancy
his
feeling
would
be
perhaps
something
as
mine
*NL*
is
.
When
I
think
of
my
friends
in
the
world
of
that
former
day
,
and
*NL*
the
sorrow
they
must
have
felt
for
me
,
it
is
with
a
pensive
pity
,
*NL*
rather
than
keen
anguish
,
as
of
a
sorrow
long
,
long
ago
ended
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
told
us
nothing
yet
of
your
friends
,
''
said
Edith
.
``
Had
you
*NL*
many
to
mourn
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
I
had
very
few
relatives
,
none
nearer
than
cousins
,
''
I
*NL*
replied
.
``
But
there
was
one
,
not
a
relative
,
but
dearer
to
me
than
any
*NL*
kin
of
blood
.
She
had
your
name
.
She
was
to
have
been
my
wife
soon
.
Ah
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
me
!
''
sighed
the
Edith
by
my
side
.
``
Think
of
the
heartache
she
must
*NL*
have
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
deep
feeling
of
this
gentle
girl
touched
a
chord
in
*NL*
my
benumbed
heart
.
My
eyes
,
before
so
dry
,
were
flooded
with
the
tears
*NL*
that
had
till
now
refused
to
come
.
When
I
had
regained
my
composure
,
I
*NL*
saw
that
she
too
had
been
weeping
freely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
God
bless
your
tender
heart
,
''
I
said
.
``
Would
you
like
to
see
her
*NL*
picture
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
locket
with
Edith
Bartlett
's
picture
,
secured
about
my
neck
*NL*
with
a
gold
chain
,
had
lain
upon
my
breast
all
through
that
long
*NL*
sleep
,
and
removing
this
I
opened
and
gave
it
to
my
companion
.
She
*NL*
took
it
with
eagerness
,
and
after
poring
long
over
the
sweet
face
,
*NL*
touched
the
picture
with
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
that
she
was
good
and
lovely
enough
to
well
deserve
your
*NL*
tears
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
remember
her
heartache
was
over
long
ago
,
and
*NL*
she
has
been
in
heaven
for
nearly
a
century
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
so
.
Whatever
her
sorrow
had
once
been
,
for
nearly
a
*NL*
century
she
had
ceased
to
weep
,
and
,
my
sudden
passion
spent
,
my
own
*NL*
tears
dried
away
.
I
had
loved
her
very
dearly
in
my
other
life
,
but
it
*NL*
was
a
hundred
years
ago
!
I
do
not
know
but
some
may
find
in
this
*NL*
confession
evidence
of
lack
of
feeling
,
but
I
think
,
perhaps
,
that
*NL*
none
can
have
had
an
experience
sufficiently
like
mine
to
enable
them
*NL*
to
judge
me
.
As
we
were
about
to
leave
the
chamber
,
my
eye
rested
upon
*NL*
the
great
iron
safe
which
stood
in
one
corner
.
Calling
my
companion
's
*NL*
attention
to
it
,
I
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
my
strong
room
as
well
as
my
sleeping
room
.
In
the
safe
*NL*
yonder
are
several
thousand
dollars
in
gold
,
and
any
amount
of
*NL*
securities
.
If
I
had
known
when
I
went
to
sleep
that
night
just
how
*NL*
long
my
nap
would
be
,
I
should
still
have
thought
that
the
gold
was
a
*NL*
safe
provision
for
my
needs
in
any
country
or
any
century
,
however
*NL*
distant
.
That
a
time
would
ever
come
when
it
would
lose
its
purchasing
*NL*
power
,
I
should
have
considered
the
wildest
of
fancies
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
here
I
wake
up
to
find
myself
among
a
people
of
whom
a
cartload
of
*NL*
gold
will
not
procure
a
loaf
of
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
might
be
expected
,
I
did
not
succeed
in
impressing
Edith
that
there
*NL*
was
anything
remarkable
in
this
fact
.
``
Why
in
the
world
should
it
?
''
*NL*
she
merely
asked
.

CHAPTER
XXI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
suggested
by
Dr.
Leete
that
we
should
devote
the
next
*NL*
morning
to
an
inspection
of
the
schools
and
colleges
of
the
city
,
with
*NL*
some
attempt
on
his
own
part
at
an
explanation
of
the
educational
*NL*
system
of
the
twentieth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
see
,
''
said
he
,
as
we
set
out
after
breakfast
,
``
many
very
*NL*
important
differences
between
our
methods
of
education
and
yours
,
but
*NL*
the
main
difference
is
that
nowadays
all
persons
equally
have
those
*NL*
opportunities
of
higher
education
which
in
your
day
only
an
*NL*
infinitesimal
portion
of
the
population
enjoyed
.
We
should
think
we
*NL*
had
gained
nothing
worth
speaking
of
,
in
equalizing
the
physical
*NL*
comfort
of
men
,
without
this
educational
equality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
cost
must
be
very
great
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
took
half
the
revenue
of
the
nation
,
nobody
would
grudge
it
,
''
*NL*
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
nor
even
if
it
took
it
all
save
a
bare
pittance
.
*NL*
But
in
truth
the
expense
of
educating
ten
thousand
youth
is
not
ten
*NL*
nor
five
times
that
of
educating
one
thousand
.
The
principle
which
*NL*
makes
all
operations
on
a
large
scale
proportionally
cheaper
than
on
a
*NL*
small
scale
holds
as
to
education
also
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
College
education
was
terribly
expensive
in
my
day
,
''
said
I.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
have
not
been
misinformed
by
our
historians
,
''
Dr.
Leete
*NL*
answered
,
``
it
was
not
college
education
but
college
dissipation
and
*NL*
extravagance
which
cost
so
highly
.
The
actual
expense
of
your
colleges
*NL*
appears
to
have
been
very
low
,
and
would
have
been
far
lower
if
their
*NL*
patronage
had
been
greater
.
The
higher
education
nowadays
is
as
cheap
*NL*
as
the
lower
,
as
all
grades
of
teachers
,
like
all
other
workers
,
*NL*
receive
the
same
support
.
We
have
simply
added
to
the
common
school
*NL*
system
of
compulsory
education
,
in
vogue
in
Massachusetts
a
hundred
*NL*
years
ago
,
a
half
dozen
higher
grades
,
carrying
the
youth
to
the
age
*NL*
of
twenty-one
and
giving
him
what
you
used
to
call
the
education
of
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
instead
of
turning
him
loose
at
fourteen
or
fifteen
with
no
*NL*
mental
equipment
beyond
reading
,
writing
,
and
the
multiplication
*NL*
table
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Setting
aside
the
actual
cost
of
these
additional
years
of
*NL*
education
,
''
I
replied
,
``
we
should
not
have
thought
we
could
afford
the
*NL*
loss
of
time
from
industrial
pursuits
.
Boys
of
the
poorer
classes
*NL*
usually
went
to
work
at
sixteen
or
younger
,
and
knew
their
trade
at
*NL*
twenty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
not
concede
you
any
gain
even
in
material
product
by
that
*NL*
plan
,
''
Dr.
Leete
replied
.
``
The
greater
efficiency
which
education
*NL*
gives
to
all
sorts
of
labor
,
except
the
rudest
,
makes
up
in
a
short
*NL*
period
for
the
time
lost
in
acquiring
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
should
also
have
been
afraid
,
''
said
I
,
``
that
a
high
education
,
*NL*
while
it
adapted
men
to
the
professions
,
would
set
them
against
manual
*NL*
labor
of
all
sorts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
the
effect
of
high
education
in
your
day
,
I
have
read
,
''
*NL*
replied
the
doctor
;
``
and
it
was
no
wonder
,
for
manual
labor
meant
*NL*
association
with
a
rude
,
coarse
,
and
ignorant
class
of
people
.
There
*NL*
is
no
such
class
now
.
It
was
inevitable
that
such
a
feeling
should
*NL*
exist
then
,
for
the
further
reason
that
all
men
receiving
a
high
*NL*
education
were
understood
to
be
destined
for
the
professions
or
for
*NL*
wealthy
leisure
,
and
such
an
education
in
one
neither
rich
nor
*NL*
professional
was
a
proof
of
disappointed
aspirations
,
an
evidence
of
*NL*
failure
,
a
badge
of
inferiority
rather
than
superiority
.
Nowadays
,
of
*NL*
course
,
when
the
highest
education
is
deemed
necessary
to
fit
a
man
*NL*
merely
to
live
,
without
any
reference
to
the
sort
of
work
he
may
do
,
*NL*
its
possession
conveys
no
such
implication
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
all
,
''
I
remarked
,
``
no
amount
of
education
can
cure
natural
*NL*
dullness
or
make
up
for
original
mental
deficiencies
.
Unless
the
*NL*
average
natural
mental
capacity
of
men
is
much
above
its
level
in
my
*NL*
day
,
a
high
education
must
be
pretty
nearly
thrown
away
on
a
large
*NL*
element
of
the
population
.
We
used
to
hold
that
a
certain
amount
of
*NL*
susceptibility
to
educational
influences
is
required
to
make
a
mind
*NL*
worth
cultivating
,
just
as
a
certain
natural
fertility
in
soil
is
*NL*
required
if
it
is
to
repay
tilling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
I
am
glad
you
used
that
illustration
,
for
it
is
*NL*
just
the
one
I
would
have
chosen
to
set
forth
the
modern
view
of
*NL*
education
.
You
say
that
land
so
poor
that
the
product
will
not
repay
*NL*
the
labor
of
tilling
is
not
cultivated
.
Nevertheless
,
much
land
that
*NL*
does
not
begin
to
repay
tilling
by
its
product
was
cultivated
in
your
*NL*
day
and
is
in
ours
.
I
refer
to
gardens
,
parks
,
lawns
,
and
,
in
general
,
*NL*
to
pieces
of
land
so
situated
that
,
were
they
left
to
grow
up
to
weeds
*NL*
and
briers
,
they
would
be
eyesores
and
inconveniences
to
all
about
.
*NL*
They
are
therefore
tilled
,
and
though
their
product
is
little
,
there
*NL*
is
yet
no
land
that
,
in
a
wider
sense
,
better
repays
cultivation
.
So
*NL*
it
is
with
the
men
and
women
with
whom
we
mingle
in
the
relations
of
*NL*
society
,
whose
voices
are
always
in
our
ears
,
whose
behavior
in
*NL*
innumerable
ways
affects
our
enjoyment
,
--
who
are
,
in
fact
,
as
much
*NL*
conditions
of
our
lives
as
the
air
we
breathe
,
or
any
of
the
physical
*NL*
elements
on
which
we
depend
.
If
,
indeed
,
we
could
not
afford
to
*NL*
educate
everybody
,
we
should
choose
the
coarsest
and
dullest
by
*NL*
nature
,
rather
than
the
brightest
,
to
receive
what
education
we
could
*NL*
give
.
The
naturally
refined
and
intellectual
can
better
dispense
with
*NL*
aids
to
culture
than
those
less
fortunate
in
natural
endowments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
borrow
a
phrase
which
was
often
used
in
your
day
,
we
should
not
*NL*
consider
life
worth
living
if
we
had
to
be
surrounded
by
a
population
*NL*
of
ignorant
,
boorish
,
coarse
,
wholly
uncultivated
men
and
women
,
as
*NL*
was
the
plight
of
the
few
educated
in
your
day
.
Is
a
man
satisfied
,
*NL*
merely
because
he
is
perfumed
himself
,
to
mingle
with
a
malodorous
*NL*
crowd
?
Could
he
take
more
than
a
very
limited
satisfaction
,
even
in
a
*NL*
palatial
apartment
,
if
the
windows
on
all
four
sides
opened
into
*NL*
stable
yards
?
And
yet
just
that
was
the
situation
of
those
considered
*NL*
most
fortunate
as
to
culture
and
refinement
in
your
day
.
I
know
that
*NL*
the
poor
and
ignorant
envied
the
rich
and
cultured
then
;
but
to
us
the
*NL*
latter
,
living
as
they
did
,
surrounded
by
squalor
and
brutishness
,
*NL*
seem
little
better
off
than
the
former
.
The
cultured
man
in
your
age
*NL*
was
like
one
up
to
the
neck
in
a
nauseous
bog
solacing
himself
with
a
*NL*
smelling
bottle
.
You
see
,
perhaps
,
now
,
how
we
look
at
this
question
*NL*
of
universal
high
education
.
No
single
thing
is
so
important
to
every
*NL*
man
as
to
have
for
neighbors
intelligent
,
companionable
persons
.
There
*NL*
is
nothing
,
therefore
,
which
the
nation
can
do
for
him
that
will
*NL*
enhance
so
much
his
own
happiness
as
to
educate
his
neighbors
.
When
it
*NL*
fails
to
do
so
,
the
value
of
his
own
education
to
him
is
reduced
by
*NL*
half
,
and
many
of
the
tastes
he
has
cultivated
are
made
positive
*NL*
sources
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
educate
some
to
the
highest
degree
,
and
leave
the
mass
wholly
*NL*
uncultivated
,
as
you
did
,
made
the
gap
between
them
almost
like
that
*NL*
between
different
natural
species
,
which
have
no
means
of
*NL*
communication
.
What
could
be
more
inhuman
than
this
consequence
of
a
*NL*
partial
enjoyment
of
education
!
Its
universal
and
equal
enjoyment
*NL*
leaves
,
indeed
,
the
differences
between
men
as
to
natural
endowments
*NL*
as
marked
as
in
a
state
of
nature
,
but
the
level
of
the
lowest
is
*NL*
vastly
raised
.
Brutishness
is
eliminated
.
All
have
some
inkling
of
the
*NL*
humanities
,
some
appreciation
of
the
things
of
the
mind
,
and
an
*NL*
admiration
for
the
still
higher
culture
they
have
fallen
short
of
.
*NL*
They
have
become
capable
of
receiving
and
imparting
,
in
various
*NL*
degrees
,
but
all
in
some
measure
,
the
pleasures
and
inspirations
of
a
*NL*
refined
social
life
.
The
cultured
society
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
--
what
did
it
consist
of
but
here
and
there
a
few
microscopic
*NL*
oases
in
a
vast
,
unbroken
wilderness
?
The
proportion
of
individuals
*NL*
capable
of
intellectual
sympathies
or
refined
intercourse
,
to
the
mass
*NL*
of
their
contemporaries
,
used
to
be
so
infinitesimal
as
to
be
in
any
*NL*
broad
view
of
humanity
scarcely
worth
mentioning
.
One
generation
of
*NL*
the
world
to-day
represents
a
greater
volume
of
intellectual
life
than
*NL*
any
five
centuries
ever
did
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
still
another
point
I
should
mention
in
stating
the
grounds
*NL*
on
which
nothing
less
than
the
universality
of
the
best
education
*NL*
could
now
be
tolerated
,
''
continued
Dr.
Leete
,
``
and
that
is
,
the
*NL*
interest
of
the
coming
generation
in
having
educated
parents
.
To
put
*NL*
the
matter
in
a
nutshell
,
there
are
three
main
grounds
on
which
our
*NL*
educational
system
rests
:
first
,
the
right
of
every
man
to
the
*NL*
completest
education
the
nation
can
give
him
on
his
own
account
,
as
*NL*
necessary
to
his
enjoyment
of
himself
;
second
,
the
right
of
his
*NL*
fellow-citizens
to
have
him
educated
,
as
necessary
to
their
enjoyment
*NL*
of
his
society
;
third
,
the
right
of
the
unborn
to
be
guaranteed
an
*NL*
intelligent
and
refined
parentage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
shall
not
describe
in
detail
what
I
saw
in
the
schools
that
day
.
*NL*
Having
taken
but
slight
interest
in
educational
matters
in
my
former
*NL*
life
,
I
could
offer
few
comparisons
of
interest
.
Next
to
the
fact
of
*NL*
the
universality
of
the
higher
as
well
as
the
lower
education
,
I
was
*NL*
most
struck
with
the
prominence
given
to
physical
culture
,
and
the
*NL*
fact
that
proficiency
in
athletic
feats
and
games
as
well
as
in
*NL*
scholarship
had
a
place
in
the
rating
of
the
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
faculty
of
education
,
''
Dr.
Leete
explained
,
``
is
held
to
the
same
*NL*
responsibility
for
the
bodies
as
for
the
minds
of
its
charges
.
The
*NL*
highest
possible
physical
,
as
well
as
mental
,
development
of
every
one
*NL*
is
the
double
object
of
a
curriculum
which
lasts
from
the
age
of
six
*NL*
to
that
of
twenty-one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
magnificent
health
of
the
young
people
in
the
schools
impressed
me
*NL*
strongly
.
My
previous
observations
,
not
only
of
the
notable
personal
*NL*
endowments
of
the
family
of
my
host
,
but
of
the
people
I
had
seen
in
*NL*
my
walks
abroad
,
had
already
suggested
the
idea
that
there
must
have
*NL*
been
something
like
a
general
improvement
in
the
physical
standard
of
*NL*
the
race
since
my
day
,
and
now
,
as
I
compared
these
stalwart
young
men
*NL*
and
fresh
,
vigorous
maidens
with
the
young
people
I
had
seen
in
the
*NL*
schools
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
I
was
moved
to
impart
my
thought
to
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
.
He
listened
with
great
interest
to
what
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
testimony
on
this
point
,
''
he
declared
,
``
is
invaluable
.
We
*NL*
believe
that
there
has
been
such
an
improvement
as
you
speak
of
,
but
*NL*
of
course
it
could
only
be
a
matter
of
theory
with
us
.
It
is
an
*NL*
incident
of
your
unique
position
that
you
alone
in
the
world
of
to-day
*NL*
can
speak
with
authority
on
this
point
.
Your
opinion
,
when
you
state
*NL*
it
publicly
,
will
,
I
assure
you
,
make
a
profound
sensation
.
For
the
*NL*
rest
it
would
be
strange
,
certainly
,
if
the
race
did
not
show
an
*NL*
improvement
.
In
your
day
,
riches
debauched
one
class
with
idleness
of
*NL*
mind
and
body
,
while
poverty
sapped
the
vitality
of
the
masses
by
*NL*
overwork
,
bad
food
,
and
pestilent
homes
.
The
labor
required
of
*NL*
children
,
and
the
burdens
laid
on
women
,
enfeebled
the
very
springs
of
*NL*
life
.
Instead
of
these
maleficent
circumstances
,
all
now
enjoy
the
*NL*
most
favorable
conditions
of
physical
life
;
the
young
are
carefully
*NL*
nurtured
and
studiously
cared
for
;
the
labor
which
is
required
of
all
*NL*
is
limited
to
the
period
of
greatest
bodily
vigor
,
and
is
never
*NL*
excessive
;
care
for
one
's
self
and
one
's
family
,
anxiety
as
to
*NL*
livelihood
,
the
strain
of
a
ceaseless
battle
for
life
--
all
these
*NL*
influences
,
which
once
did
so
much
to
wreck
the
minds
and
bodies
of
*NL*
men
and
women
,
are
known
no
more
.
Certainly
,
an
improvement
of
the
*NL*
species
ought
to
follow
such
a
change
.
In
certain
specific
respects
we
*NL*
know
,
indeed
,
that
the
improvement
has
taken
place
.
Insanity
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
which
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
so
terribly
common
a
*NL*
product
of
your
insane
mode
of
life
,
has
almost
disappeared
,
with
its
*NL*
alternative
,
suicide
.

CHAPTER
XXII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
had
made
an
appointment
to
meet
the
ladies
at
the
dining-hall
for
*NL*
dinner
,
after
which
,
having
some
engagement
,
they
left
us
sitting
at
*NL*
table
there
,
discussing
our
wine
and
cigars
with
a
multitude
of
other
*NL*
matters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doctor
,
''
said
I
,
in
the
course
of
our
talk
,
``
morally
speaking
,
your
*NL*
social
system
is
one
which
I
should
be
insensate
not
to
admire
in
*NL*
comparison
with
any
previously
in
vogue
in
the
world
,
and
especially
*NL*
with
that
of
my
own
most
unhappy
century
.
If
I
were
to
fall
into
a
*NL*
mesmeric
sleep
to-night
as
lasting
as
that
other
,
and
meanwhile
the
*NL*
course
of
time
were
to
take
a
turn
backward
instead
of
forward
,
and
I
*NL*
were
to
wake
up
again
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
when
I
had
told
my
*NL*
friends
what
I
had
seen
,
they
would
every
one
admit
that
your
world
*NL*
was
a
paradise
of
order
,
equity
,
and
felicity
.
But
they
were
a
very
*NL*
practical
people
,
my
contemporaries
,
and
after
expressing
their
*NL*
admiration
for
the
moral
beauty
and
material
splendor
of
the
system
,
*NL*
they
would
presently
begin
to
cipher
and
ask
how
you
got
the
money
to
*NL*
make
everybody
so
happy
;
for
certainly
,
to
support
the
whole
nation
at
*NL*
a
rate
of
comfort
,
and
even
luxury
,
such
as
I
see
around
me
,
must
*NL*
involve
vastly
greater
wealth
than
the
nation
produced
in
my
day
.
Now
,
*NL*
while
I
could
explain
to
them
pretty
nearly
everything
else
of
the
*NL*
main
features
of
your
system
,
I
should
quite
fail
to
answer
this
*NL*
question
,
and
failing
there
,
they
would
tell
me
,
for
they
were
very
*NL*
close
cipherers
,
that
I
had
been
dreaming
;
nor
would
they
ever
believe
*NL*
anything
else
.
In
my
day
,
I
know
that
the
total
annual
product
of
the
*NL*
nation
,
although
it
might
have
been
divided
with
absolute
equality
,
*NL*
would
not
have
come
to
more
than
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
per
*NL*
head
,
not
very
much
more
than
enough
to
supply
the
necessities
of
life
*NL*
with
few
or
any
of
its
comforts
.
How
is
it
that
you
have
so
much
*NL*
more
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
very
pertinent
question
,
Mr.
West
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
and
*NL*
I
should
not
blame
your
friends
,
in
the
case
you
supposed
,
if
they
*NL*
declared
your
story
all
moonshine
,
failing
a
satisfactory
reply
to
it
.
*NL*
It
is
a
question
which
I
can
not
answer
exhaustively
at
any
one
*NL*
sitting
,
and
as
for
the
exact
statistics
to
bear
out
my
general
*NL*
statements
,
I
shall
have
to
refer
you
for
them
to
books
in
my
library
,
*NL*
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
pity
to
leave
you
to
be
put
to
confusion
*NL*
by
your
old
acquaintances
,
in
case
of
the
contingency
you
speak
of
,
*NL*
for
lack
of
a
few
suggestions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
us
begin
with
a
number
of
small
items
wherein
we
economize
wealth
*NL*
as
compared
with
you
.
We
have
no
national
,
state
,
county
,
or
*NL*
municipal
debts
,
or
payments
on
their
account
.
We
have
no
sort
of
*NL*
military
or
naval
expenditures
for
men
or
materials
,
no
army
,
navy
,
or
*NL*
militia
.
We
have
no
revenue
service
,
no
swarm
of
tax
assessors
and
*NL*
collectors
.
As
regards
our
judiciary
,
police
,
sheriffs
,
and
jailers
,
*NL*
the
force
which
Massachusetts
alone
kept
on
foot
in
your
day
far
more
*NL*
than
suffices
for
the
nation
now
.
We
have
no
criminal
class
preying
*NL*
upon
the
wealth
of
society
as
you
had
.
The
number
of
persons
,
more
or
*NL*
less
absolutely
lost
to
the
working
force
through
physical
disability
,
*NL*
of
the
lame
,
sick
,
and
debilitated
,
which
constituted
such
a
burden
on
*NL*
the
able-bodied
in
your
day
,
now
that
all
live
under
conditions
of
*NL*
health
and
comfort
,
has
shrunk
to
scarcely
perceptible
proportions
,
*NL*
and
with
every
generation
is
becoming
more
completely
eliminated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
item
wherein
we
save
is
the
disuse
of
money
and
the
thousand
*NL*
occupations
connected
with
financial
operations
of
all
sorts
,
whereby
*NL*
an
army
of
men
was
formerly
taken
away
from
useful
employments
.
Also
*NL*
consider
that
the
waste
of
the
very
rich
in
your
day
on
inordinate
*NL*
personal
luxury
has
ceased
,
though
,
indeed
,
this
item
might
easily
be
*NL*
over-estimated
.
Again
,
consider
that
there
are
no
idlers
now
,
rich
or
*NL*
poor
,
--
no
drones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
important
cause
of
former
poverty
was
the
vast
waste
of
labor
*NL*
and
materials
which
resulted
from
domestic
washing
and
cooking
,
and
*NL*
the
performing
separately
of
innumerable
other
tasks
to
which
we
apply
*NL*
the
cooperative
plan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
larger
economy
than
any
of
these
--
yes
,
of
all
together
--
is
effected
*NL*
by
the
organization
of
our
distributing
system
,
by
which
the
work
done
*NL*
once
by
the
merchants
,
traders
,
storekeepers
,
with
their
various
*NL*
grades
of
jobbers
,
wholesalers
,
retailers
,
agents
,
commercial
*NL*
travelers
,
and
middlemen
of
all
sorts
,
with
an
excessive
waste
of
*NL*
energy
in
needless
transportation
and
interminable
handlings
,
is
*NL*
performed
by
one-tenth
the
number
of
hands
and
an
unnecessary
turn
of
*NL*
not
one
wheel
.
Something
of
what
our
distributing
system
is
like
you
*NL*
know
.
Our
statisticians
calculate
that
one
eightieth
part
of
our
*NL*
workers
suffices
for
all
the
processes
of
distribution
which
in
your
*NL*
day
required
one
eighth
of
the
population
,
so
much
being
withdrawn
*NL*
from
the
force
engaged
in
productive
labor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
begin
to
see
,
''
I
said
,
``
where
you
get
your
greater
wealth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
but
you
scarcely
do
as
yet
.
*NL*
The
economies
I
have
mentioned
thus
far
,
in
the
aggregate
,
considering
*NL*
the
labor
they
would
save
directly
and
indirectly
through
saving
of
*NL*
material
,
might
possibly
be
equivalent
to
the
addition
to
your
annual
*NL*
production
of
wealth
of
one-half
its
former
total
.
These
items
are
,
*NL*
however
,
scarcely
worth
mentioning
in
comparison
with
other
prodigious
*NL*
wastes
,
now
saved
,
which
resulted
inevitably
from
leaving
the
*NL*
industries
of
the
nation
to
private
enterprise
.
However
great
the
*NL*
economies
your
contemporaries
might
have
devised
in
the
consumption
*NL*
of
products
,
and
however
marvelous
the
progress
of
mechanical
*NL*
invention
,
they
could
never
have
raised
themselves
out
of
the
slough
*NL*
of
poverty
so
long
as
they
held
to
that
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
mode
more
wasteful
for
utilizing
human
energy
could
be
devised
,
*NL*
and
for
the
credit
of
the
human
intellect
it
should
be
remembered
that
*NL*
the
system
never
was
devised
,
but
was
merely
a
survival
from
the
rude
*NL*
ages
when
the
lack
of
social
organization
made
any
sort
of
cooperation
*NL*
impossible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
readily
admit
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
our
industrial
system
was
*NL*
ethically
very
bad
,
but
as
a
mere
wealth-making
machine
,
apart
from
*NL*
moral
aspects
,
it
seemed
to
us
admirable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
I
said
,
''
responded
the
doctor
,
``
the
subject
is
too
large
to
*NL*
discuss
at
length
now
,
but
if
you
are
really
interested
to
know
the
*NL*
main
criticisms
which
we
moderns
make
on
your
industrial
system
as
*NL*
compared
with
our
own
,
I
can
touch
briefly
on
some
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
wastes
which
resulted
from
leaving
the
conduct
of
industry
to
*NL*
irresponsible
individuals
,
wholly
without
mutual
understanding
or
*NL*
concert
,
were
mainly
four
:
first
,
the
waste
by
mistaken
undertakings
;
*NL*
second
,
the
waste
from
the
competition
and
mutual
hostility
of
those
*NL*
engaged
in
industry
;
third
,
the
waste
by
periodical
gluts
and
crises
,
*NL*
with
the
consequent
interruptions
of
industry
;
fourth
,
the
waste
from
*NL*
idle
capital
and
labor
,
at
all
times
.
Any
one
of
these
four
great
*NL*
leaks
,
were
all
the
others
stopped
,
would
suffice
to
make
the
*NL*
difference
between
wealth
and
poverty
on
the
part
of
a
nation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
the
waste
by
mistaken
undertakings
,
to
begin
with
.
In
your
day
*NL*
the
production
and
distribution
of
commodities
being
without
concert
*NL*
or
organization
,
there
was
no
means
of
knowing
just
what
demand
there
*NL*
was
for
any
class
of
products
,
or
what
was
the
rate
of
supply
.
*NL*
Therefore
,
any
enterprise
by
a
private
capitalist
was
always
a
*NL*
doubtful
experiment
.
The
projector
having
no
general
view
of
the
field
*NL*
of
industry
and
consumption
,
such
as
our
government
has
,
could
never
*NL*
be
sure
either
what
the
people
wanted
,
or
what
arrangements
other
*NL*
capitalists
were
making
to
supply
them
.
In
view
of
this
,
we
are
not
*NL*
surprised
to
learn
that
the
chances
were
considered
several
to
one
in
*NL*
favor
of
the
failure
of
any
given
business
enterprise
,
and
that
it
was
*NL*
common
for
persons
who
at
last
succeeded
in
making
a
hit
to
have
*NL*
failed
repeatedly
.
If
a
shoemaker
,
for
every
pair
of
shoes
he
*NL*
succeeded
in
completing
,
spoiled
the
leather
of
four
or
five
pair
,
*NL*
besides
losing
the
time
spent
on
them
,
he
would
stand
about
the
same
*NL*
chance
of
getting
rich
as
your
contemporaries
did
with
their
system
of
*NL*
private
enterprise
,
and
its
average
of
four
or
five
failures
to
one
*NL*
success
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
of
the
great
wastes
was
that
from
competition
.
The
field
of
*NL*
industry
was
a
battlefield
as
wide
as
the
world
,
in
which
the
workers
*NL*
wasted
,
in
assailing
one
another
,
energies
which
,
if
expended
in
*NL*
concerted
effort
,
as
to-day
,
would
have
enriched
all
.
As
for
mercy
or
*NL*
quarter
in
this
warfare
,
there
was
absolutely
no
suggestion
of
it
.
To
*NL*
deliberately
enter
a
field
of
business
and
destroy
the
enterprises
of
*NL*
those
who
had
occupied
it
previously
,
in
order
to
plant
one
's
own
*NL*
enterprise
on
their
ruins
,
was
an
achievement
which
never
failed
to
*NL*
command
popular
admiration
.
Nor
is
there
any
stretch
of
fancy
in
*NL*
comparing
this
sort
of
struggle
with
actual
warfare
,
so
far
as
*NL*
concerns
the
mental
agony
and
physical
suffering
which
attended
the
*NL*
struggle
,
and
the
misery
which
overwhelmed
the
defeated
and
those
*NL*
dependent
on
them
.
Now
nothing
about
your
age
is
,
at
first
sight
,
more
*NL*
astounding
to
a
man
of
modern
times
than
the
fact
that
men
engaged
in
*NL*
the
same
industry
,
instead
of
fraternizing
as
comrades
and
co-laborers
*NL*
to
a
common
end
,
should
have
regarded
each
other
as
rivals
and
enemies
*NL*
to
be
throttled
and
overthrown
.
This
certainly
seems
like
sheer
*NL*
madness
,
a
scene
from
bedlam
.
But
more
closely
regarded
,
it
is
seen
to
*NL*
be
no
such
thing
.
Your
contemporaries
,
with
their
mutual
*NL*
throat-cutting
,
knew
very
well
what
they
were
at
.
The
producers
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
were
not
,
like
ours
,
working
together
for
the
*NL*
maintenance
of
the
community
,
but
each
solely
for
his
own
maintenance
*NL*
at
the
expense
of
the
community
.
If
,
in
working
to
this
end
,
he
at
the
*NL*
same
time
increased
the
aggregate
wealth
,
that
was
merely
incidental
.
*NL*
It
was
just
as
feasible
and
as
common
to
increase
one
's
private
hoard
*NL*
by
practices
injurious
to
the
general
welfare
.
One
's
worst
enemies
*NL*
were
necessarily
those
of
his
own
trade
,
for
,
under
your
plan
of
*NL*
making
private
profit
the
motive
of
production
,
a
scarcity
of
the
*NL*
article
he
produced
was
what
each
particular
producer
desired
.
It
was
*NL*
for
his
interest
that
no
more
of
it
should
be
produced
than
he
himself
*NL*
could
produce
.
To
secure
this
consummation
as
far
as
circumstances
*NL*
permitted
,
by
killing
off
and
discouraging
those
engaged
in
his
line
*NL*
of
industry
,
was
his
constant
effort
.
When
he
had
billed
off
all
he
*NL*
could
,
his
policy
was
to
combine
with
those
he
could
not
kill
,
and
*NL*
convert
their
mutual
warfare
into
a
warfare
upon
the
public
at
large
*NL*
by
cornering
the
market
,
as
I
believe
you
used
to
call
it
,
and
putting
*NL*
up
prices
to
the
highest
point
people
would
stand
before
going
without
*NL*
the
goods
.
The
day
dream
of
the
nineteenth
century
producer
was
to
*NL*
gain
absolute
control
of
the
supply
of
some
necessity
of
life
,
so
that
*NL*
he
might
keep
the
public
at
the
verge
of
starvation
,
and
always
*NL*
command
famine
prices
for
what
he
supplied
.
This
,
Mr.
West
,
is
what
*NL*
was
called
in
the
nineteenth
century
a
system
of
production
.
I
will
*NL*
leave
it
to
you
if
it
does
not
seem
,
in
some
of
its
aspects
,
a
great
*NL*
deal
more
like
a
system
for
preventing
production
.
Some
time
when
we
*NL*
have
plenty
of
leisure
I
am
going
to
ask
you
to
sit
down
with
me
and
*NL*
try
to
make
me
comprehend
,
as
I
never
yet
could
,
though
I
have
*NL*
studied
the
matter
a
great
deal
,
how
such
shrewd
fellows
as
your
*NL*
contemporaries
appear
to
have
been
in
many
respects
ever
came
to
*NL*
entrust
the
business
of
providing
for
the
community
to
a
class
whose
*NL*
interest
it
was
to
starve
it
.
I
assure
you
that
the
wonder
with
us
is
,
*NL*
not
that
the
world
did
not
get
rich
under
such
a
system
,
but
that
it
*NL*
did
not
perish
outright
from
want
.
This
wonder
increases
as
we
go
on
*NL*
to
consider
some
of
the
other
prodigious
wastes
that
characterized
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Apart
from
the
waste
of
labor
and
capital
by
misdirected
industry
,
*NL*
and
that
from
the
constant
bloodletting
of
your
industrial
warfare
,
*NL*
your
system
was
liable
to
periodical
convulsions
,
overwhelming
alike
*NL*
the
wise
and
unwise
,
the
successful
cut-throat
as
well
as
his
victim
.
*NL*
I
refer
to
the
business
crises
at
intervals
of
five
to
ten
years
,
*NL*
which
wrecked
the
industries
of
the
nation
,
prostrating
all
weak
*NL*
enterprises
and
crippling
the
strongest
,
and
were
followed
by
long
*NL*
periods
,
often
of
many
years
,
of
so-called
dull
times
,
during
which
*NL*
the
capitalists
slowly
regathered
their
dissipated
strength
while
the
*NL*
laboring
classes
starved
and
rioted
.
Then
would
ensue
another
brief
*NL*
season
of
prosperity
,
followed
in
turn
by
another
crisis
and
the
*NL*
ensuing
years
of
exhaustion
.
As
commerce
developed
,
making
the
nations
*NL*
mutually
dependent
,
these
arises
became
world-wide
,
while
the
*NL*
obstinacy
of
the
ensuing
state
of
collapse
increased
with
the
area
*NL*
affected
by
the
convulsions
,
and
the
consequent
lack
of
rallying
*NL*
centres
.
In
proportion
as
the
industries
of
the
world
multiplied
and
*NL*
became
complex
,
and
the
volume
of
capital
involved
was
increased
,
*NL*
these
business
cataclysms
became
more
frequent
,
till
,
in
the
latter
*NL*
part
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
there
were
two
years
of
bad
times
to
*NL*
one
of
good
,
and
the
system
of
industry
,
never
before
so
extended
or
*NL*
so
imposing
,
seemed
in
danger
of
collapsing
by
its
own
weight
.
After
*NL*
endless
discussions
,
your
economists
appear
by
that
time
to
have
*NL*
settled
down
to
the
despairing
conclusion
that
there
was
no
more
*NL*
possibility
of
preventing
or
controlling
these
crises
than
if
they
had
*NL*
been
drouths
or
hurricanes
.
It
only
remained
to
endure
them
as
*NL*
necessary
evils
,
and
when
they
had
passed
over
to
build
up
again
the
*NL*
shattered
structure
of
industry
,
as
dwellers
in
an
earthquake
country
*NL*
keep
on
rebuilding
their
cities
on
the
same
site
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
considering
the
causes
of
the
trouble
inherent
in
their
*NL*
industrial
system
,
your
contemporaries
were
certainly
correct
.
They
*NL*
were
in
its
very
basis
,
and
must
needs
become
more
and
more
maleficent
*NL*
as
the
business
fabric
grew
in
size
and
complexity
.
One
of
these
*NL*
causes
was
the
lack
of
any
common
control
of
the
different
industries
,
*NL*
and
the
consequent
impossibility
of
their
orderly
and
coordinate
*NL*
development
.
It
inevitably
resulted
from
this
lack
that
they
were
*NL*
continually
getting
out
of
step
with
one
another
and
out
of
relation
*NL*
with
the
demand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
the
latter
there
was
no
criterion
such
as
organized
distribution
*NL*
gives
us
,
and
the
first
notice
that
it
had
been
exceeded
in
any
group
*NL*
of
industries
was
a
crash
of
prices
,
bankruptcy
of
producers
,
stoppage
*NL*
of
production
,
reduction
of
wages
,
or
discharge
of
workmen
.
This
*NL*
process
was
constantly
going
on
in
many
industries
,
even
in
what
were
*NL*
called
good
times
,
but
a
crisis
took
place
only
when
the
industries
*NL*
affected
were
extensive
.
The
markets
then
were
glutted
with
goods
,
of
*NL*
which
nobody
wanted
beyond
a
sufficiency
at
any
price
.
The
wages
and
*NL*
profits
of
those
making
the
glutted
classes
of
goods
being
reduced
or
*NL*
wholly
stopped
,
their
purchasing
power
as
consumers
of
other
classes
*NL*
of
goods
,
of
which
there
was
no
natural
glut
,
was
taken
away
,
and
,
as
*NL*
a
consequence
,
goods
of
which
there
was
no
natural
glut
became
*NL*
artificially
glutted
,
till
their
prices
also
were
broken
down
,
and
*NL*
their
makers
thrown
out
of
work
and
deprived
of
income
.
The
crisis
was
*NL*
by
this
time
fairly
under
way
,
and
nothing
could
check
it
till
a
*NL*
nation
's
ransom
had
been
wasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
cause
,
also
inherent
in
your
system
,
which
often
produced
and
*NL*
always
terribly
aggravated
crises
,
was
the
machinery
of
money
and
*NL*
credit
.
Money
was
essential
when
production
was
in
many
private
hands
,
*NL*
and
buying
and
selling
was
necessary
to
secure
what
one
wanted
.
It
*NL*
was
,
however
,
open
to
the
obvious
objection
of
substituting
for
food
,
*NL*
clothing
,
and
other
things
a
merely
conventional
representative
of
*NL*
them
.
The
confusion
of
mind
which
this
favored
,
between
goods
and
*NL*
their
representative
,
led
the
way
to
the
credit
system
and
its
*NL*
prodigious
illusions
.
Already
accustomed
to
accept
money
for
*NL*
commodities
,
the
people
next
accepted
promises
for
money
,
and
ceased
*NL*
to
look
at
all
behind
the
representative
for
the
thing
represented
.
*NL*
Money
was
a
sign
of
real
commodities
,
but
credit
was
but
the
sign
of
a
*NL*
sign
.
There
was
a
natural
limit
to
gold
and
silver
,
that
is
,
money
*NL*
proper
,
but
none
to
credit
,
and
the
result
was
that
the
volume
of
*NL*
credit
,
that
is
,
the
promises
of
money
,
ceased
to
bear
any
*NL*
ascertainable
proportion
to
the
money
,
still
less
to
the
commodities
,
*NL*
actually
in
existence
.
Under
such
a
system
,
frequent
and
periodical
*NL*
crises
were
necessitated
by
a
law
as
absolute
as
that
which
brings
to
*NL*
the
ground
a
structure
overhanging
its
centre
of
gravity
.
It
was
one
*NL*
of
your
fictions
that
the
government
and
the
banks
authorized
by
it
*NL*
alone
issued
money
;
but
everybody
who
gave
a
dollar
's
credit
issued
*NL*
money
to
that
extent
,
which
was
as
good
as
any
to
swell
the
*NL*
circulation
till
the
next
crises
.
The
great
extension
of
the
credit
*NL*
system
was
a
characteristic
of
the
latter
part
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
and
accounts
largely
for
the
almost
incessant
business
crises
*NL*
which
marked
that
period
.
Perilous
as
credit
was
,
you
could
not
*NL*
dispense
with
its
use
,
for
,
lacking
any
national
or
other
public
*NL*
organization
of
the
capital
of
the
country
,
it
was
the
only
means
you
*NL*
had
for
concentrating
and
directing
it
upon
industrial
enterprises
.
It
*NL*
was
in
this
way
a
most
potent
means
for
exaggerating
the
chief
peril
*NL*
of
the
private
enterprise
system
of
industry
by
enabling
particular
*NL*
industries
to
absorb
disproportionate
amounts
of
the
disposable
*NL*
capital
of
the
country
,
and
thus
prepare
disaster
.
Business
*NL*
enterprises
were
always
vastly
in
debt
for
advances
of
credit
,
both
to
*NL*
one
another
and
to
the
banks
and
capitalists
,
and
the
prompt
*NL*
withdrawal
of
this
credit
at
the
first
sign
of
a
crisis
was
generally
*NL*
the
precipitating
cause
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
the
misfortune
of
your
contemporaries
that
they
had
to
cement
*NL*
their
business
fabric
with
a
material
which
an
accident
might
at
any
*NL*
moment
turn
into
an
explosive
.
They
were
in
the
plight
of
a
man
*NL*
building
a
house
with
dynamite
for
mortar
,
for
credit
can
be
compared
*NL*
with
nothing
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
see
how
needless
were
these
convulsions
of
business
*NL*
which
I
have
been
speaking
of
,
and
how
entirely
they
resulted
from
*NL*
leaving
industry
to
private
and
unorganized
management
,
just
consider
*NL*
the
working
of
our
system
.
Overproduction
in
special
lines
,
which
was
*NL*
the
great
hobgoblin
of
your
day
,
is
impossible
now
,
for
by
the
*NL*
connection
between
distribution
and
production
supply
is
geared
to
*NL*
demand
like
an
engine
to
the
governor
which
regulates
its
speed
.
Even
*NL*
suppose
by
an
error
of
judgment
an
excessive
production
of
some
*NL*
commodity
.
The
consequent
slackening
or
cessation
of
production
in
*NL*
that
line
throws
nobody
out
of
employment
.
The
suspended
workers
are
*NL*
at
once
found
occupation
in
some
other
department
of
the
vast
workshop
*NL*
and
lose
only
the
time
spent
in
changing
,
while
,
as
for
the
glut
,
the
*NL*
business
of
the
nation
is
large
enough
to
carry
any
amount
of
product
*NL*
manufactured
in
excess
of
demand
till
the
latter
overtakes
it
.
In
such
*NL*
a
case
of
over-production
,
as
I
have
supposed
,
there
is
not
with
us
,
*NL*
as
with
you
,
any
complex
machinery
to
get
out
of
order
and
magnify
a
*NL*
thousand
times
the
original
mistake
.
Of
course
,
having
not
even
money
,
*NL*
we
still
less
have
credit
.
All
estimates
deal
directly
with
the
real
*NL*
things
,
the
flour
,
iron
,
wood
,
wool
,
and
labor
,
of
which
money
and
*NL*
credit
were
for
you
the
very
misleading
representatives
.
In
our
*NL*
calculations
of
cost
there
can
be
no
mistakes
.
Out
of
the
annual
*NL*
product
the
amount
necessary
for
the
support
of
the
people
is
taken
,
*NL*
and
the
requisite
labor
to
produce
the
next
year
's
consumption
*NL*
provided
for
.
The
residue
of
the
material
and
labor
represents
what
*NL*
can
be
safely
expended
in
improvements
.
If
the
crops
are
bad
,
the
*NL*
surplus
for
that
year
is
less
than
usual
,
that
is
all
.
Except
for
*NL*
slight
occasional
effects
of
such
natural
causes
,
there
are
no
*NL*
fluctuations
of
business
;
the
material
prosperity
of
the
nation
flows
*NL*
on
uninterruptedly
from
generation
to
generation
,
like
an
ever
*NL*
broadening
and
deepening
river

Your

Mr.
West

continued
the
doctor

``
like
either
*NL*
of
the
great
wastes
I
mentioned
before

were
enough
,
alone
,
to
have
*NL*
kept
your
noses
to
the
grindstone
forever
;
but
I
have
still
to
speak
*NL*
of
one
other
great
cause
of
your
poverty
,
and
that
was
the
idleness
of
*NL*
a
great
part
of
your
capital
and
labor
.
With
us
it
is
the
business
of
*NL*
the
administration
to
keep
in
constant
employment
every
ounce
of
*NL*
available
capital
and
labor
in
the
country
.
In
your
day
there
was
no
*NL*
general
control
of
either
capital
or
labor
,
and
a
large
part
of
both
*NL*
failed
to
find
employment
.
`
Capital
,
'
you
used
to
say
,
`
is
naturally
*NL*
timid
,
'
and
it
would
certainly
have
been
reckless
if
it
had
not
been
*NL*
timid
in
an
epoch
when
there
was
a
large
preponderance
of
probability
*NL*
that
any
particular
business
venture
would
end
in
failure
.
There
was
*NL*
no
time
when
,
if
security
could
have
been
guaranteed
it
,
the
amount
of
*NL*
capital
devoted
to
productive
industry
could
not
have
been
greatly
*NL*
increased
.
The
proportion
of
it
so
employed
underwent
constant
*NL*
extraordinary
fluctuations
,
according
to
the
greater
or
less
feeling
*NL*
of
uncertainty
as
to
the
stability
of
the
industrial
situation
,
so
*NL*
that
the
output
of
the
national
industries
greatly
varied
in
different
*NL*
years
.
But
for
the
same
reason
that
the
amount
of
capital
employed
at
*NL*
times
of
special
insecurity
was
far
less
than
at
times
of
somewhat
*NL*
greater
security
,
a
very
large
proportion
was
never
employed
at
all
,
*NL*
because
the
hazard
of
business
was
always
very
great
in
the
best
of
*NL*
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
should
be
also
noted
that
the
great
amount
of
capital
always
*NL*
seeking
employment
where
tolerable
safety
could
be
insured
terribly
*NL*
embittered
the
competition
between
capitalists
when
a
promising
*NL*
opening
presented
itself
.
The
idleness
of
capital
,
the
result
of
its
*NL*
timidity
,
of
course
meant
the
idleness
of
labor
in
corresponding
*NL*
degree
.
Moreover
,
every
change
in
the
adjustments
of
business
,
every
*NL*
slightest
alteration
in
the
condition
of
commerce
or
manufactures
,
not
*NL*
to
speak
of
the
innumerable
business
failures
that
took
place
yearly
,
*NL*
even
in
the
best
of
times
,
were
constantly
throwing
a
multitude
of
men
*NL*
out
of
employment
for
periods
of
weeks
or
months
,
or
even
years
.
A
*NL*
great
number
of
these
seekers
after
employment
were
constantly
*NL*
traversing
the
country
,
becoming
in
time
professional
vagabonds
,
then
*NL*
criminals
.
`
Give
us
work
!
'
was
the
cry
of
an
army
of
the
unemployed
at
*NL*
nearly
all
seasons
,
and
in
seasons
of
dullness
in
business
this
army
*NL*
swelled
to
a
host
so
vast
and
desperate
as
to
threaten
the
stability
*NL*
of
the
government
.
Could
there
conceivably
be
a
more
conclusive
*NL*
demonstration
of
the
imbecility
of
the
system
of
private
enterprise
as
*NL*
a
method
for
enriching
a
nation
than
the
fact
that
,
in
an
age
of
such
*NL*
general
poverty
and
want
of
everything
,
capitalists
had
to
throttle
*NL*
one
another
to
find
a
safe
chance
to
invest
their
capital
and
workmen
*NL*
rioted
and
burned
because
they
could
find
no
work
to
do
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Mr.
West
,
''
continued
Dr.
Leete
,
``
I
want
you
to
bear
in
mind
that
*NL*
these
points
of
which
I
have
been
speaking
indicate
only
negatively
*NL*
the
advantages
of
the
national
organization
of
industry
by
showing
*NL*
certain
fatal
defects
and
prodigious
imbecilities
of
the
systems
of
*NL*
private
enterprise
which
are
not
found
in
it
.
These
alone
,
you
must
*NL*
admit
,
would
pretty
well
explain
why
the
nation
is
so
much
richer
than
*NL*
in
your
day
.
But
the
larger
half
of
our
advantage
over
you
,
the
*NL*
positive
side
of
it
,
I
have
yet
barely
spoken
of
.
Supposing
the
system
*NL*
of
private
enterprise
in
industry
were
without
any
of
the
great
leaks
*NL*
I
have
mentioned
;
that
there
were
no
waste
on
account
of
misdirected
*NL*
effort
growing
out
of
mistakes
as
to
the
demand
,
and
inability
to
*NL*
command
a
general
view
of
the
industrial
field
.
Suppose
,
also
,
there
*NL*
were
no
neutralizing
and
duplicating
of
effort
from
competition
.
*NL*
Suppose
,
also
,
there
were
no
waste
from
business
panics
and
crises
*NL*
through
bankruptcy
and
long
interruptions
of
industry
,
and
also
none
*NL*
from
the
idleness
of
capital
and
labor
.
Supposing
these
evils
,
which
*NL*
are
essential
to
the
conduct
of
industry
by
capital
in
private
hands
,
*NL*
could
all
be
miraculously
prevented
,
and
the
system
yet
retained
;
even
*NL*
then
the
superiority
of
the
results
attained
by
the
modern
industrial
*NL*
system
of
national
control
would
remain
overwhelming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
used
to
have
some
pretty
large
textile
manufacturing
*NL*
establishments
,
even
in
your
day
,
although
not
comparable
with
ours
.
*NL*
No
doubt
you
have
visited
these
great
mills
in
your
time
,
covering
*NL*
acres
of
ground
,
employing
thousands
of
hands
,
and
combining
under
one
*NL*
roof
,
under
one
control
,
the
hundred
distinct
processes
between
,
say
,
*NL*
the
cotton
bale
and
the
bale
of
glossy
calicoes
.
You
have
admired
the
*NL*
vast
economy
of
labor
as
of
mechanical
force
resulting
from
the
*NL*
perfect
interworking
with
the
rest
of
every
wheel
and
every
hand
.
No
*NL*
doubt
you
have
reflected
how
much
less
the
same
force
of
workers
*NL*
employed
in
that
factory
would
accomplish
if
they
were
scattered
,
each
*NL*
man
working
independently
.
Would
you
think
it
an
exaggeration
to
say
*NL*
that
the
utmost
product
of
those
workers
,
working
thus
apart
,
however
*NL*
amicable
their
relations
might
be
,
was
increased
not
merely
by
a
*NL*
percentage
,
but
many
fold
,
when
their
efforts
were
organized
under
one
*NL*
control
?
Well
now
,
Mr.
West
,
the
organization
of
the
industry
of
the
*NL*
nation
under
a
single
control
,
so
that
all
its
processes
interlock
,
*NL*
has
multiplied
the
total
product
over
the
utmost
that
could
be
done
*NL*
under
the
former
system
,
even
leaving
out
of
account
the
four
great
*NL*
wastes
mentioned
,
in
the
same
proportion
that
the
product
of
those
*NL*
millworkers
was
increased
by
cooperation
.
The
effectiveness
of
the
*NL*
working
force
of
a
nation
,
under
the
myriad-headed
leadership
of
*NL*
private
capital
,
even
if
the
leaders
were
not
mutual
enemies
,
as
*NL*
compared
with
that
which
it
attains
under
a
single
head
,
may
be
*NL*
likened
to
the
military
efficiency
of
a
mob
,
or
a
horde
of
barbarians
*NL*
with
a
thousand
petty
chiefs
,
as
compared
with
that
of
a
disciplined
*NL*
army
under
one
general
--
such
a
fighting
machine
,
for
example
,
as
the
*NL*
German
army
in
the
time
of
Von
Moltke
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
After
what
you
have
told
me
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
do
not
so
much
wonder
that
*NL*
the
nation
is
richer
now
than
then
,
but
that
you
are
not
all
*NL*
Croesuses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
we
are
pretty
well
off
.
The
rate
at
which
*NL*
we
live
is
as
luxurious
as
we
could
wish
.
The
rivalry
of
ostentation
,
*NL*
which
in
your
day
led
to
extravagance
in
no
way
conducive
to
comfort
,
*NL*
finds
no
place
,
of
course
,
in
a
society
of
people
absolutely
equal
in
*NL*
resources
,
and
our
ambition
stops
at
the
surroundings
which
minister
*NL*
to
the
enjoyment
of
life
.
We
might
,
indeed
,
have
much
larger
incomes
,
*NL*
individually
,
if
we
chose
so
to
use
the
surplus
of
our
product
,
but
we
*NL*
prefer
to
expend
it
upon
public
works
and
pleasures
in
which
all
*NL*
share
,
upon
public
halls
and
buildings
,
art
galleries
,
bridges
,
*NL*
statuary
,
means
or
transit
,
and
the
conveniences
of
our
cities
,
great
*NL*
musical
and
theatrical
exhibitions
,
and
in
providing
on
a
vast
scale
*NL*
for
the
recreations
of
the
people
.
You
have
not
begun
to
see
how
we
*NL*
live
yet
,
Mr.
West
.
At
home
we
have
comfort
,
but
the
splendor
of
our
*NL*
life
is
,
on
its
social
side
,
that
which
we
share
with
our
fellows
.
*NL*
When
you
know
more
of
it
you
will
see
where
the
money
goes
,
as
you
*NL*
used
to
say
,
and
I
think
you
will
agree
that
we
do
well
so
to
expend
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
observed
Dr.
Leete
,
as
we
strolled
homeward
from
the
*NL*
dining
hall
,
``
that
no
reflection
would
have
cut
the
men
of
your
*NL*
wealth-worshiping
century
more
keenly
than
the
suggestion
that
they
*NL*
did
not
know
how
to
make
money
.
Nevertheless
,
that
is
just
the
verdict
*NL*
history
has
passed
on
them
.
Their
system
of
unorganized
and
*NL*
antagonistic
industries
was
as
absurd
economically
as
it
was
morally
*NL*
abominable
.
Selfishness
was
their
only
science
,
and
in
industrial
*NL*
production
selfishness
is
suicide
.
Competition
,
which
is
the
instinct
*NL*
of
selfishness
,
is
another
word
for
dissipation
of
energy
,
while
*NL*
combination
is
the
secret
of
efficient
production
;
and
not
till
the
*NL*
idea
of
increasing
the
individual
hoard
gives
place
to
the
idea
of
*NL*
increasing
the
common
stock
can
industrial
combination
be
realized
,
*NL*
and
the
acquisition
of
wealth
really
begin
.
Even
if
the
principle
of
*NL*
share
and
share
alike
for
all
men
were
not
the
only
humane
and
*NL*
rational
basis
for
a
society
,
we
should
still
enforce
it
as
*NL*
economically
expedient
,
seeing
that
until
the
disintegrating
influence
*NL*
of
self-seeking
is
suppressed
no
true
concert
of
industry
is
*NL*
possible

CHAPTER
XXIII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
as
I
sat
with
Edith
in
the
music
room
,
listening
to
some
*NL*
pieces
in
the
programme
of
that
day
which
had
attracted
my
notice
,
I
*NL*
took
advantage
of
an
interval
in
the
music
to
say
,
``
I
have
a
question
*NL*
to
ask
you
which
I
fear
is
rather
indiscreet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
quite
sure
it
is
not
that
,
''
she
replied
,
encouragingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
in
the
position
of
an
eavesdropper
,
''
I
continued
,
``
who
,
having
*NL*
overheard
a
little
of
a
matter
not
intended
for
him
,
though
seeming
to
*NL*
concern
him
,
has
the
impudence
to
come
to
the
speaker
for
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
eavesdropper
!
''
she
repeated
,
looking
puzzled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
an
excusable
one
,
as
I
think
you
will
admit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
mysterious
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
``
so
mysterious
that
often
I
have
doubted
whether
I
*NL*
really
overheard
at
all
what
I
am
going
to
ask
you
about
,
or
only
*NL*
dreamed
it
.
I
want
you
to
tell
me
.
The
matter
is
this
:
When
I
was
*NL*
coming
out
of
that
sleep
of
a
century
,
the
first
impression
of
which
I
*NL*
was
conscious
was
of
voices
talking
around
me
,
voices
that
afterwards
*NL*
I
recognized
as
your
father
's
,
your
mother
's
,
and
your
own
.
First
,
I
*NL*
remember
your
father
's
voice
saying
,
`
He
is
going
to
open
his
eyes
.
He
*NL*
had
better
see
but
one
person
at
first
.
'
Then
you
said
,
if
I
did
not
*NL*
dream
it
all
,
`
Promise
me
,
then
,
that
you
will
not
tell
him
.
'
Your
*NL*
father
seemed
to
hesitate
about
promising
,
but
you
insisted
,
and
your
*NL*
mother
interposing
,
he
finally
promised
,
and
when
I
opened
my
eyes
I
*NL*
saw
only
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
been
quite
serious
when
I
said
that
I
was
not
sure
that
I
had
*NL*
not
dreamed
the
conversation
I
fancied
I
had
overheard
,
so
*NL*
incomprehensible
was
it
that
these
people
should
know
anything
of
me
,
*NL*
a
contemporary
of
their
great-grandparents
,
which
I
did
not
know
*NL*
myself
.
But
when
I
saw
the
effect
of
my
words
upon
Edith
,
I
knew
that
*NL*
it
was
no
dream
,
but
another
mystery
,
and
a
more
puzzling
one
than
any
*NL*
I
had
before
encountered
.
For
from
the
moment
that
the
drift
of
my
*NL*
question
became
apparent
,
she
showed
indications
of
the
most
acute
*NL*
embarrassment
.
Her
eyes
,
always
so
frank
and
direct
in
expression
,
had
*NL*
dropped
in
a
panic
before
mine
,
while
her
face
crimsoned
from
neck
to
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pardon
me
,
''
I
said
,
as
soon
as
I
had
recovered
from
bewilderment
at
*NL*
the
extraordinary
effect
of
my
words
.
``
It
seems
,
then
,
that
I
was
not
*NL*
dreaming
.
There
is
some
secret
,
something
about
me
,
which
you
are
*NL*
withholding
from
me
.
Really
,
does
n't
it
seem
a
little
hard
that
a
*NL*
person
in
my
position
should
not
be
given
all
the
information
possible
*NL*
concerning
himself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
not
concern
you
--
that
is
,
not
directly
.
It
is
not
about
*NL*
you
--
exactly
,
''
she
replied
,
scarcely
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
concerns
me
in
some
way
,
''
I
persisted
.
``
It
must
be
something
*NL*
that
would
interest
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
even
that
,
''
she
replied
,
venturing
a
momentary
glance
at
*NL*
my
face
,
furiously
blushing
,
and
yet
with
a
quaint
smile
flickering
*NL*
about
her
lips
which
betrayed
a
certain
perception
of
humor
in
the
*NL*
situation
despite
its
embarrassment
,
--
``
I
am
not
sure
that
it
would
*NL*
even
interest
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
would
have
told
me
,
''
I
insisted
,
with
an
accent
of
*NL*
reproach
.
``
It
was
you
who
forbade
him
.
He
thought
I
ought
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
reply
.
She
was
so
entirely
charming
in
her
confusion
that
*NL*
I
was
now
prompted
,
as
much
by
the
desire
to
prolong
the
situation
as
*NL*
by
my
original
curiosity
,
to
importune
her
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
never
to
know
?
Will
you
never
tell
me
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
depends
,
''
she
answered
,
after
a
long
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
what
?
''
I
persisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
you
ask
too
much
,
''
she
replied
.
Then
,
raising
to
mine
a
face
*NL*
which
inscrutable
eyes
,
flushed
cheeks
,
and
smiling
lips
combined
to
*NL*
render
perfectly
bewitching
,
she
added
,
``
What
should
you
think
if
I
*NL*
said
that
it
depended
on
--
yourself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
myself
?
''
I
echoed
.
``
How
can
that
possibly
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
West
,
we
are
losing
some
charming
music
,
''
was
her
only
reply
to
*NL*
this
,
and
turning
to
the
telephone
,
at
a
touch
of
her
finger
she
set
*NL*
the
air
to
swaying
to
the
rhythm
of
an
adagio
.
After
that
she
took
*NL*
good
care
that
the
music
should
leave
no
opportunity
for
conversation
.
*NL*
She
kept
her
face
averted
from
me
,
and
pretended
to
be
absorbed
in
the
*NL*
airs
,
but
that
it
was
a
mere
pretense
the
crimson
tide
standing
at
*NL*
flood
in
her
cheeks
sufficiently
betrayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
length
she
suggested
that
I
might
have
heard
all
I
cared
to
,
*NL*
for
that
time
,
and
we
rose
to
leave
the
room
,
she
came
straight
up
to
*NL*
me
and
said
,
without
raising
her
eyes
,
``
Mr.
West
,
you
say
I
have
been
*NL*
good
to
you
.
I
have
not
been
particularly
so
,
but
if
you
think
I
have
,
*NL*
I
want
you
to
promise
me
that
you
will
not
try
again
to
make
me
tell
*NL*
you
this
thing
you
have
asked
to-night
,
and
that
you
will
not
try
to
*NL*
find
it
out
from
any
one
else
,
--
my
father
or
mother
,
for
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
an
appeal
there
was
but
one
reply
possible
.
``
Forgive
me
for
*NL*
distressing
you
.
Of
course
I
will
promise
,
''
I
said
.
``
I
would
never
*NL*
have
asked
you
if
I
had
fancied
it
could
distress
you
.
But
do
you
*NL*
blame
me
for
being
curious
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
blame
you
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
some
time
,
''
I
added
,
``
if
I
do
not
tease
you
,
you
may
tell
me
of
*NL*
your
own
accord
.
May
I
not
hope
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
perhaps
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
up
,
she
read
my
face
with
a
quick
,
deep
glance
.
``
Yes
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
``
I
think
I
may
tell
you
--
some
time
;
''
and
so
our
conversation
*NL*
ended
,
for
she
gave
me
no
chance
to
say
anything
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
I
do
n't
think
even
Dr.
Pillsbury
could
have
put
me
to
*NL*
sleep
,
till
toward
morning
at
least
.
Mysteries
had
been
my
accustomed
*NL*
food
for
days
now
,
but
none
had
before
confronted
me
at
once
so
*NL*
mysterious
and
so
fascinating
as
this
,
the
solution
of
which
Edith
*NL*
Leete
had
forbidden
me
even
to
seek
.
It
was
a
double
mystery
.
How
,
in
*NL*
the
first
place
,
was
it
conceivable
that
she
should
know
any
secret
*NL*
about
me
,
a
stranger
from
a
strange
age
?
In
the
second
place
,
even
if
*NL*
she
should
know
such
a
secret
,
how
account
for
the
agitating
effect
*NL*
which
the
knowledge
of
it
seemed
to
have
upon
her
?
There
are
puzzles
*NL*
so
difficult
that
one
can
not
even
get
so
far
as
a
conjecture
as
to
the
*NL*
solution
,
and
this
seemed
one
of
them
.
I
am
usually
of
too
practical
a
*NL*
turn
to
waste
time
on
such
conundrums
;
but
the
difficulty
of
a
riddle
*NL*
embodied
in
a
beautiful
young
girl
does
not
detract
from
its
*NL*
fascination
.
In
general
,
no
doubt
,
maidens
'
blushes
may
be
safely
*NL*
assumed
to
tell
the
same
tale
to
young
men
in
all
ages
and
races
,
but
*NL*
to
give
that
interpretation
to
Edith
's
crimson
cheeks
would
,
*NL*
considering
my
position
and
the
length
of
time
I
had
known
her
,
and
*NL*
still
more
the
fact
that
this
mystery
dated
from
before
I
had
known
*NL*
her
at
all
,
be
a
piece
of
utter
fatuity
.
And
yet
she
was
an
angel
,
and
*NL*
I
should
not
have
been
a
young
man
if
reason
and
common
sense
had
been
*NL*
able
quite
to
banish
a
roseate
tinge
from
my
dreams
that
night
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
I
went
down
stairs
early
in
the
hope
of
seeing
Edith
*NL*
alone
.
In
this
,
however
,
I
was
disappointed
.
Not
finding
her
in
the
*NL*
house
,
I
sought
her
in
the
garden
,
but
she
was
not
there
.
In
the
*NL*
course
of
my
wanderings
I
visited
the
underground
chamber
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
there
to
rest
.
Upon
the
reading
table
in
the
chamber
several
*NL*
periodicals
and
newspapers
lay
,
and
thinking
that
Dr.
Leete
might
be
*NL*
interested
in
glancing
over
a
Boston
daily
of
1887
,
I
brought
one
of
*NL*
the
papers
with
me
into
the
house
when
I
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast
I
met
Edith
.
She
blushed
as
she
greeted
me
,
but
was
*NL*
perfectly
self-possessed
.
As
we
sat
at
table
,
Dr.
Leete
amused
himself
*NL*
with
looking
over
the
paper
I
had
brought
in
.
There
was
in
it
,
as
in
*NL*
all
the
newspapers
of
that
date
,
a
great
deal
about
the
labor
*NL*
troubles
,
strikes
,
lockouts
,
boycotts
,
the
programmes
of
labor
*NL*
parties
,
and
the
wild
threats
of
the
anarchists
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
the
way
,
''
said
I
,
as
the
doctor
read
aloud
to
us
some
of
these
*NL*
items
,
``
what
part
did
the
followers
of
the
red
flag
take
in
the
*NL*
establishment
of
the
new
order
of
things
?
They
were
making
*NL*
considerable
noise
the
last
thing
that
I
knew
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
except
to
hinder
it
,
of
course
,
''
*NL*
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
They
did
that
very
effectually
while
they
lasted
,
*NL*
for
their
talk
so
disgusted
people
as
to
deprive
the
best
considered
*NL*
projects
for
social
reform
of
a
hearing
.
The
subsidizing
of
those
*NL*
fellows
was
one
of
the
shrewdest
moves
of
the
opponents
of
reform
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Subsidizing
them
!
''
I
exclaimed
in
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
.
``
No
historical
authority
nowadays
*NL*
doubts
that
they
were
paid
by
the
great
monopolies
to
wave
the
red
*NL*
flag
and
talk
about
burning
,
sacking
,
and
blowing
people
up
,
in
order
,
*NL*
by
alarming
the
timid
,
to
head
off
any
real
reforms
.
What
astonishes
*NL*
me
most
is
that
you
should
have
fallen
into
the
trap
so
*NL*
unsuspectingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
your
grounds
for
believing
that
the
red
flag
party
was
*NL*
subsidized
?
''
I
inquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
simply
because
they
must
have
seen
that
their
course
made
a
*NL*
thousand
enemies
of
their
professed
cause
to
one
friend
.
Not
to
*NL*
suppose
that
they
were
hired
for
the
work
is
to
credit
them
with
an
*NL*
inconceivable
folly
.

In
the
United
States
,
of
all
countries
,
no
*NL*
party
could
intelligently
expect
to
carry
its
point
without
first
*NL*
winning
over
to
its
ideas
a
majority
of
the
nation
,
as
the
national
*NL*
party
eventually
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
national
party
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
``
That
must
have
arisen
after
my
*NL*
day
.
I
suppose
it
was
one
of
the
labor
parties
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
The
labor
parties
,
as
such
,
never
could
*NL*
have
accomplished
anything
on
a
large
or
permanent
scale
.
For
purposes
*NL*
of
national
scope
,
their
basis
as
merely
class
organizations
was
too
*NL*
narrow
.
It
was
not
till
a
rearrangement
of
the
industrial
and
social
*NL*
system
on
a
higher
ethical
basis
,
and
for
the
more
efficient
*NL*
production
of
wealth
,
was
recognized
as
the
interest
,
not
of
one
*NL*
class
,
but
equally
of
all
classes
,
of
rich
and
poor
,
cultured
and
*NL*
ignorant
,
old

young
,
weak
and
strong
,
men
and
women
,
that
there
*NL*
was
any
prospect
that
it
would
be
achieved
.
Then
the
national
party
*NL*
arose
to
carry
it
out
by
political
methods
.
It
probably
took
that
name
*NL*
because
its
aim
was
to
nationalize
the
functions
of
production
and
*NL*
distribution
.
Indeed
,
it
could
not
well
have
had
any
other
name
,
for
*NL*
its
purpose
was
to
realize
the
idea
of
the
nation
with
a
grandeur
and
*NL*
completeness
never
before
conceived
,
not
as
an
association
of
men
for
*NL*
certain
merely
political
functions
affecting
their
happiness
only
*NL*
remotely
and
superficially
,
but
as
a
family
,
a
vital
union
,
a
common
*NL*
life
,
a
mighty
heaven-touching
tree
whose
leaves
are
its
people
,
fed
*NL*
from
its
veins
,
and
feeding
it
in
turn
.
The
most
patriotic
of
all
*NL*
possible
parties
,
it
sought
to
justify
patriotism
and
raise
it
from
*NL*
an
instinct
to
a
rational
devotion
,
by
making
the
native
land
truly
a
*NL*
father
land
,
a
father
who
kept
the
people
alive
and
was
not
merely
an
*NL*
idol
for
which
they
were
expected
to
die

they
were

,
at

there

CHAPTER
XXV
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
personality
of
Edith
Leete
had
naturally
impressed
me
strongly
*NL*
ever
since
I
had
come
,
in
so
strange
a
manner
,
to
be
an
inmate
of
her
*NL*
father
's
house
,
and
it
was
to
be
expected
that
after
what
had
happened
*NL*
the
night
previous
,
I
should
be
more
than
ever
preoccupied
with
*NL*
thoughts
of
her
.
From
the
first
I
had
been
struck
with
the
air
of
*NL*
serene
frankness
and
ingenuous
directness
,
more
like
that
of
a
noble
*NL*
and
innocent
boy
than
any
girl
I
had
ever
known
,
which
characterized
*NL*
her
.
I
was
curious
to
know
how
far
this
charming
quality
might
be
*NL*
peculiar
to
herself
,
and
how
far
possibly
a
result
of
alterations
in
*NL*
the
social
position
of
women
which
might
have
taken
place
since
my
*NL*
time
.
Finding
an
opportunity
that
day
,
when
alone
with
Dr.
Leete
,
I
*NL*
turned
the
conversation
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
women
nowadays
,
having
been
relieved
of
the
*NL*
burden
of
housework
,
have
no
employment
but
the
cultivation
of
their
*NL*
charms
and
graces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
far
as
we
men
are
concerned
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
we
should
*NL*
consider
that
they
amply
paid
their
way
,
to
use
one
of
your
forms
of
*NL*
expression
,
if
they
confined
themselves
to
that
occupation
,
but
you
*NL*
may
be
very
sure
that
they
have
quite
too
much
spirit
to
consent
to
be
*NL*
mere
beneficiaries
of
society
,
even
as
a
return
for
ornamenting
it
.
*NL*
They
did
,
indeed
,
welcome
their
riddance
from
housework
,
because
that
*NL*
was
not
only
exceptionally
wearing
in
itself
,
but
also
wasteful
,
in
*NL*
the
extreme
,
of
energy
,
as
compared
with
the
cooperative
plan
;
but
*NL*
they
accepted
relief
from
that
sort
of
work
only
that
they
might
*NL*
contribute
in
other
and
more
effectual
,
as
well
as
more
agreeable
,
*NL*
ways
to
the
common
weal
.
Our
women
,
as
well
as
our
men
,
are
members
of
*NL*
the
industrial
army
,
and
leave
it
only
when
maternal
duties
claim
*NL*
them
.
The
result
is
that
most
women
,
at
one
time
or
another
of
their
*NL*
lives
,
serve
industrially
some
five
or
ten
or
fifteen
years
,
while
*NL*
those
who
have
no
children
fill
out
the
full
term
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
does
not
,
then
,
necessarily
leave
the
industrial
service
on
*NL*
marriage
?
''
I
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
than
a
man
,
''
replied
the
doctor
.
``
Why
on
earth
should
she
?
*NL*
Married
women
have
no
housekeeping
responsibilities
now
,
you
know
,
and
*NL*
a
husband
is
not
a
baby
that
he
should
be
cared
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
thought
one
of
the
most
grievous
features
of
our
civilization
*NL*
that
we
required
so
much
toil
from
women
,
''
I
said
;
``
but
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
you
get
more
out
of
them
than
we
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
laughed
.
``
Indeed
we
do
,
just
as
we
do
out
of
our
men
.
Yet
*NL*
the
women
of
this
age
are
very
happy
,
and
those
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
unless
contemporary
references
greatly
mislead
us
,
were
very
*NL*
miserable
.
The
reason
that
women
nowadays
are
so
much
more
efficient
*NL*
co-laborers
with
the
men
,
and
at
the
same
time
are
so
happy
,
is
that
,
*NL*
in
regard
to
their
work
as
well
as
men
's
,
we
follow
the
principle
of
*NL*
providing
every
one
the
kind
of
occupation
he
or
she
is
best
adapted
*NL*
to
.
Women
being
inferior
in
strength
to
men
,
and
further
disqualified
*NL*
industrially
in
special
ways
,
the
kinds
of
occupation
reserved
for
*NL*
them
,
and
the
conditions
under
which
they
pursue
them
,
have
reference
*NL*
to
these
facts
.
The
heavier
sorts
of
work
are
everywhere
reserved
for
*NL*
men
,
the
lighter
occupations
for
women
.
Under
no
circumstances
is
a
*NL*

follow
any
employment
not
perfectly
adapted
,
both
*NL*
as
to
kind
and
degree
of
labor
,
to
her
sex
.
Moreover
,
the
hours
of
*NL*
women
's
work
are
considerably
shorter
than
those
of
men
's
,
more
*NL*
frequent
vacations
are
granted
,
and
the
most
careful
provision
is
made
*NL*
for
rest
when
needed
.
The
men
of
this
day
so
well
appreciate
that
they
*NL*
owe
to
the
beauty
and
grace
of
women
the
chief
zest
of
their
lives
and
*NL*
their
main
incentive
to
effort
,
that
they
permit
them
to
work
at
all
*NL*
only
because
it
is
fully
understood
that
a
certain
regular
requirement
*NL*
of
labor
,
of
a
sort
adapted
to
their
powers
,
is
well
for
body
and
*NL*
mind
,
during
the
period
of
maximum
physical
vigor
.
We
believe
that
*NL*
the
magnificent
health
which
distinguishes
our
women
from
those
of
*NL*
your
day
,
who
seem
to
have
been
so
generally
sickly
,
is
owing
largely
*NL*
to
the
fact
that
all
alike
are
furnished
with
healthful
and
*NL*
inspiriting
occupation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understood
you
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
the
women-workers
belong
to
the
army
*NL*
of
industry
,
but
how
can
they
be
under
the
same
system
of
ranking
and
*NL*
discipline
with
the
men
,
when
the
conditions
of
their
labor
are
so
*NL*
different
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
under
an
entirely
different
discipline
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
*NL*
``
and
constitute
rather
an
allied
force
than
an
integral
part
of
the
*NL*
army
of
the
men
.
They
have
a
woman
general-in-chief
and
are
under
*NL*
exclusively
feminine
regime
.
This
general
,
as
also
the
higher
*NL*
officers
,
is
chosen
by
the
body
of
women
who
have
passed
the
time
of
*NL*
service
,
in
correspondence
with
the
manner
in
which
the
chiefs
of
the
*NL*
masculine
army
and
the
President
of
the
nation
are
elected
.
The
*NL*
general
of
the
women
's
army
sits
in
the
cabinet
of
the
President
and
*NL*
has
a
veto
on
measures
respecting
women
's
work
,
pending
appeals
to
*NL*
Congress
.
I
should
have
said
,
in
speaking
of
the
judiciary
,
that
we
*NL*
have
women
on
the
bench
,
appointed
by
the
general
of
the
women
,
as
*NL*
well
as
men
.
Causes
in
which
both
parties
are
women
are
determined
by
*NL*
women
judges
,
and
where
a
man
and
a
woman
are
parties
to
a
case
,
a
*NL*
judge
of
either
sex
must
consent
to
the
verdict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Womanhood
seems
to
be
organized
as
a
sort
of
_
imperium
in
imperio
_
in
*NL*
your
system
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
some
extent
,
''
Dr.
Leete
replied
;
``
but
the
inner
_
imperium
_
is
one
*NL*
from
which
you
will
admit
there
is
not
likely
to
be
much
danger
to
the
*NL*
nation
.
The
lack
of
some
such
recognition
of
the
distinct
*NL*
individuality
of
the
sexes
was
one
of
the
innumerable
defects
of
your
*NL*
society
.
The
passional
attraction
between
men
and
women
has
too
often
*NL*
prevented
a
perception
of
the
profound
differences
which
make
the
*NL*
members
of
each
sex
in
many
things
strange
to
the
other
,
and
capable
*NL*
of
sympathy
only
with
their
own
.
It
is
in
giving
full
play
to
the
*NL*
differences
of
sex
rather
than
in
seeking
to
obliterate
them
,
as
was
*NL*
apparently
the
effort
of
some
reformers
in
your
day
,
that
the
*NL*
enjoyment
of
each
by
itself
and
the
piquancy
which
each
has
for
the
*NL*
other
,
are
alike
enhanced
.
In
your
day
there
was
no
career
for
women
*NL*
except
in
an
unnatural
rivalry
with
men
.
We
have
given
them
a
world
of
*NL*
their
own
,
with
its
emulations
,
ambitions
,
and
careers
,
and
I
assure
*NL*
you
they
are
very
happy
in
it
.
It
seems
to
us
that
women
were
more
*NL*
than
any
other
class
the
victims
of
your
civilization
.
There
is
*NL*
something
which
,
even
at
this
distance
of
time
,
penetrates
one
with
*NL*
pathos
in
the
spectacle
of
their
ennuied
,
undeveloped
lives
,
stunted
*NL*
at
marriage
,
their
narrow
horizon
,
bounded
so
often
,
physically
,
by
*NL*
the
four
walls
of
home
,
and
morally
by
a
petty
circle
of
personal
*NL*
interests
.
I
speak
now
,
not
of
the
poorer
classes
,
who
were
generally
*NL*
worked
to
death
,
but
also
of
the
well-to-do
and
rich
.
From
the
great
*NL*
sorrows
,
as
well
as
the
petty
frets
of
life
,
they
had
no
refuge
in
the
*NL*
breezy
outdoor
world
of
human
affairs
,
nor
any
interests
save
those
of
*NL*
the
family
.
Such
an
existence
would
have
softened
men
's
brains
or
*NL*
driven
them
mad
.
All
that
is
changed
to-day
.
No
woman
is
heard
*NL*
nowadays
wishing
she
were
a
man
,
nor
parents
desiring
boy
rather
than
*NL*
girl
children
.
Our
girls
are
as
full
of
ambition
for
their
careers
as
*NL*
our
boys
.
Marriage
,
when
it
comes
,
does
not
mean
incarceration
for
*NL*
them
,
nor
does
it
separate
them
in
any
way
from
the
larger
interests
*NL*
of
society
,
the
bustling
life
of
the
world
.
Only
when
maternity
fills
*NL*
a
woman
's
mind
with
new
interests
does
she
withdraw
from
the
world
for
*NL*
a
time
.
Afterwards
,
and
at
any
time
,
she
may
return
to
her
place
among
*NL*
her
comrades
,
nor
need
she
ever
lose
touch
with
them
.
Women
are
a
very
*NL*
happy
race
nowadays
,
as
compared
with
what
they
ever
were
before
in
*NL*
the
world
's
history
,
and
their
power
of
giving
happiness
to
men
has
*NL*
been
of
course
increased
in
proportion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
imagine
it
possible
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
the
interest
which
girls
*NL*
take
in
their
careers
as
members
of
the
industrial
army
and
candidates
*NL*
for
its
distinctions
might
have
an
effect
to
deter
them
from
*NL*
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
smiled
.
``
Have
no
anxiety
on
that
score
,
Mr.
West
,
''
he
*NL*
replied
.
``
The
Creator
took
very
good
care
that
whatever
other
*NL*
modifications
the
dispositions
of
men
and
women
might
with
time
take
*NL*
on
,
their
attraction
for
each
other
should
remain
constant
.
The
mere
*NL*
fact
that
in
an
age
like
yours
,
when
the
struggle
for
existence
must
*NL*
have
left
people
little
time
for
other
thoughts
,
and
the
future
was
so
*NL*
uncertain
that
to
assume
parental
responsibilities
must
have
often
*NL*
seemed
like
a
criminal
risk
,
there
was
even
then
marrying
and
giving
*NL*
in
marriage
,
should
be
conclusive
on
this
point
.
As
for
love
nowadays
,
*NL*
one
of
our
authors
says
that
the
vacuum
left
in
the
minds
of
men
and
*NL*
women
by
the
absence
of
care
for
one
's
livelihood
has
been
entirely
*NL*
taken
up
by
the
tender
passion
.
That
,
however
,
I
beg
you
to
believe
,
*NL*
is
something
of
an
exaggeration
.
For
the
rest
,
so
far
is
marriage
from
*NL*
being
an
interference
with
a
woman
's
career
,
that
the
higher
positions
*NL*
in
the
feminine
army
of
industry
are
intrusted
only
to
women
who
have
*NL*
been
both
wives
and
mothers
,
as
they
alone
fully
represent
their
sex
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
credit
cards
issued
to
the
women
just
as
to
the
men
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
credits
of
the
women
,
I
suppose
,
are
for
smaller
sums
,
owing
to
*NL*
the
frequent
suspension
of
their
labor
on
account
of
family
*NL*
responsibilities
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smaller
!
''
exclaimed
Dr.
Leete
,
``
oh
,
no
!
The
maintenance
of
all
our
*NL*
people
is
the
same
.
There
are
no
exceptions
to
that
rule
,
but
if
any
*NL*
difference
were
made
on
account
of
the
interruptions
you
speak
of
,
it
*NL*
would
be
by
making
the
woman
's
credit
larger
,
not
smaller
.
Can
you
*NL*
think
of
any
service
constituting
a
stronger
claim
on
the
nation
's
*NL*
gratitude
than
bearing
and
nursing
the
nation
's
children
?
According
to
*NL*
our
view
,
none
deserve
so
well
of
the
world
as
good
parents
.
There
is
*NL*
no
task
so
unselfish
,
so
necessarily
without
return
,
though
the
heart
*NL*
is
well
rewarded
,
as
the
nurture
of
the
children
who
are
to
make
the
*NL*
world
for
one
another
when
we
are
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
seem
to
follow
,
from
what
you
have
said
,
that
wives
are
in
*NL*
no
way
dependent
on
their
husbands
for
maintenance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
are
not
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
,
``
nor
children
on
their
*NL*
parents
either
,
that
is
,
for
means
of
support
,
though
of
course
they
*NL*
are
for
the
offices
of
affection
.
The
child
's
labor
,
when
he
grows
up
,
*NL*
will
go
to
increase
the
common
stock
,
not
his
parents
'
,
who
will
be
*NL*
dead
,
and
therefore
he
is
properly
nurtured
out
of
the
common
stock
.
*NL*
The
account
of
every
person
,
man
,
woman
,
and
child
,
you
must
*NL*
understand
,
is
always
with
the
nation
directly
,
and
never
through
any
*NL*
intermediary
,
except
,
of
course
,
that
parents
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
*NL*
act
for
children
as
their
guardians
.
You
see
that
it
is
by
virtue
of
*NL*
the
relation
of
individuals
to
the
nation
,
of
their
membership
in
it
,
*NL*
that
they
are
entitled
to
support
;
and
this
title
is
in
no
way
*NL*
connected
with
or
affected
by
their
relations
to
other
individuals
who
*NL*
are
fellow
members
of
the
nation
with
them
.
That
any
person
should
be
*NL*
dependent
for
the
means
of
support
upon
another
would
be
shocking
to
*NL*
the
moral
sense
as
well
as
indefensible
on
any
rational
social
theory
.
*NL*
What
would
become
of
personal
liberty
and
dignity
under
such
an
*NL*
arrangement
?
I
am
aware
that
you
called
yourselves
free
in
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
.
The
meaning
of
the
word
could
not
then
,
however
,
*NL*
have
been
at
all
what
it
is
at
present
,
or
you
certainly
would
not
*NL*
have
applied
it
to
a
society
of
which
nearly
every
member
was
in
a
*NL*
position
of
galling
personal
dependence
upon
others
as
to
the
very
*NL*
means
of
life
,
the
poor
upon
the
rich
,
or
employed
upon
employer
,
*NL*
women
upon
men
,
children
upon
parents
.
Instead
of
distributing
the
*NL*
product
of
the
nation
directly
to
its
members
,
which
would
seem
the
*NL*
most
natural
and
obvious
method
,
it
would
actually
appear
that
you
had
*NL*
given
your
minds
to
devising
a
plan
of
hand
to
hand
distribution
,
*NL*
involving
the
maximum
of
personal
humiliation
to
all
classes
of
*NL*
recipients
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
regards
the
dependence
of
women
upon
men
for
support
,
which
then
*NL*
was
usual
,
of
course
,
natural
attraction
in
case
of
marriages
of
love
*NL*
must
often
have
made
it
endurable
,
though
for
spirited
women
I
should
*NL*
fancy
it
must
always
have
remained
humiliating
.
What
,
then
,
must
it
*NL*
have
been
in
the
innumerable
cases
where
women
,
with
or
without
the
*NL*
form
of
marriage
,
had
to
sell
themselves
to
men
to
get
their
living
?
*NL*
Even
your
contemporaries
,
callous
as
they
were
to
most
of
the
*NL*
revolting
aspects
of
their
society
,
seem
to
have
had
an
idea
that
this
*NL*
was
not
quite
as
it
should
be
;
but
,
it
was
still
only
for
pity
's
sake
*NL*
that
they
deplored
the
lot
of
the
women
.
It
did
not
occur
to
them
that
*NL*
it
was
robbery
as
well
as
cruelty
when
men
seized
for
themselves
the
*NL*
whole
product
of
the
world
and
left
women
to
beg
and
wheedle
for
their
*NL*
share

Why
--
but
bless
me
,
Mr.
West
,
I
am
really
running
on
at
a
*NL*
remarkable
rate
,
just
as
if
the
robbery
,
the
sorrow
,
and
the
shame
*NL*
which
those
poor
women
endured
were
not
over
a
century
since
,
or
as
if
*NL*
you
were
responsible
for
what
you
no
doubt
deplored
as
much
as
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
bear
my
share
of
responsibility
for
the
world
as
it
then
was
,
''
*NL*
I
replied
.
``
All
I
can
say
in
extenuation
is
that
until
the
nation
was
*NL*
ripe
for
the
present
system
of
organized
production
and
distribution
,
*NL*
no
radical
improvement
in
the
position
of
woman
was
possible
.
The
root
*NL*
of
her
disability
,
as
you
say
,
was
her
personal
dependence
upon
man
*NL*
for
her
livelihood
,
and
I
can
imagine
no
other
mode
of
social
*NL*
organization
than
that
you
have
adopted
,
which
would
have
set
woman
*NL*
free
of
man
at
the
same
time
that
it
set
men
free
of
one
another
.
I
*NL*
suppose
,
by
the
way
,
that
so
entire
a
change
in
the
position
of
women
*NL*
can
not
have
taken
place
without
affecting
in
marked
ways
the
social
*NL*
relations
of
the
sexes
.
That
will
be
a
very
interesting
study
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
change
you
will
observe
,
''
said
Dr.
Leete
,
``
will
chiefly
be
,
I
*NL*
think
,
the
entire
frankness
and
unconstraint
which
now
characterizes
*NL*
those
relations
,
as
compared
with
the
artificiality
which
seems
to
*NL*
have
marked
them
in
your
time
.
The
sexes
now
meet
with
the
ease
of
*NL*
perfect
equals
,
suitors
to
each
other
for
nothing
but
love
.
In
your
*NL*
time
the
fact
that
women
were
dependent
for
support
on
men
made
the
*NL*
woman
in
reality
the
one
chiefly
benefited
by
marriage
.
This
fact
,
so
*NL*
far
as
we
can
judge
from
contemporary
records
,
appears
to
have
been
*NL*
coarsely
enough
recognized
among
the
lower
classes
,
while
among
the
*NL*
more
polished
it
was
glossed
over
by
a
system
of
elaborate
*NL*
conventionalities
which
aimed
to
carry
the
precisely
opposite
meaning
,
*NL*
namely
,
that
the
man
was
the
party
chiefly
benefited
.
To
keep
up
this
*NL*
convention
it
was
essential
that
he
should
always
seem
the
suitor
.
*NL*
Nothing
was
therefore
considered
more
shocking
to
the
proprieties
than
*NL*
that
a
woman
should
betray
a
fondness
for
a
man
before
he
had
*NL*
indicated
a
desire
to
marry

Why
,
we
actually
have
in
our
*NL*
libraries
books
,
by
authors
of
your
day
,
written
for
no
other
purpose
*NL*
than
to
discuss
the
question
whether
,
under
any
conceivable
*NL*
circumstances
,
a
woman
might
,
without
discredit
to
her
sex
,
reveal
an
*NL*
unsolicited
love
.
All
this
seems
exquisitely
absurd
to
us
,
and
yet
we
*NL*
know
that
,
given
your
circumstances
,
the
problem
might
have
a
serious
*NL*
side
.
When
for
a
woman
to
proffer
her
love
to
a
man
was
in
effect
to
*NL*
invite
him
to
assume
the
burden
of
her
support
,
it
is
easy
to
see
that
*NL*
pride
and
delicacy
might
well
have
checked
the
promptings
of
the
*NL*
heart
.
When
you
go
out
into
our
society
,
Mr.
West
,
you
must
be
*NL*
prepared
to
be
often
cross-questioned
on
this
point
by
our
young
*NL*
people
,
who
are
naturally
much
interested
in
this
aspect
of
*NL*
old-fashioned
manners

``
But
*NL*
the
fact

means
*NL*
even
more

perhaps
,
than
you
probably
at

realize

It
means
that

for
the
first

in
human
history
the
principle
of
sexual

,
*NL*
with
its

to
accept
as
the

of
their

men
whom
they
neither
*NL*
can
love
nor

Wealth
and
rank
no

from
*NL*
personal
qualities

Gold
no

gilds

of

The
gifts
of
person
,
mind
,
and
disposition
;
beauty
,
wit
,
*NL*
eloquence
,
kindness
,
generosity
,
geniality
,
courage

are
sure
of
*NL*
transmission
to
posterity
.
Every
generation
is
sifted
through
a
little
*NL*
finer
mesh
than
the
last
.
The
attributes
that
human
nature
admires
are
*NL*
preserved
,
those
that
repel
it
are
left
behind
.
There
are
,
of
course
,
*NL*
a
great
many
women
who
with
love
must
mingle
admiration
,
and
seek
to
*NL*
wed
greatly
,
but
these
not
the
less
obey
the
same
law
,
for
to
wed
*NL*
greatly
now
is
not
to
marry
men
of
fortune
or
title
,
but
those
who
*NL*
have
risen
above
their
fellows
by
the
solidity
or
brilliance
of
their
*NL*
services
to
humanity
.
These
form
nowadays
the
only
aristocracy
with
*NL*
which
alliance
is
distinction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
speaking
,
a
day
or
two
ago
,
of
the
physical
superiority
of
*NL*
our
people
to
your
contemporaries
.
Perhaps
more
important
than
any
of
*NL*
the
causes
I
mentioned
then
as
tending
to
race
purification
has
been
*NL*
the
effect
of
untrammeled
sexual
selection
upon
the
quality
of
two
or
*NL*
three
successive
generations
.
I
believe
that
when
you
have
made
a
*NL*
fuller
study
of
our
people
you
will
find
in
them
not
only
a
physical
,
*NL*
but
a
mental
and
moral
improvement
.
It
would
be
strange
if
it
were
not
*NL*
so
,
for
not
only
is
one
of
the
great
laws
of
nature
now
freely
working
*NL*
out
the
salvation
of
the
race
,
but
a
profound
moral
sentiment
has
come
*NL*
to
its
support
.
Individualism
,
which
in
your
day
was
the
animating
*NL*
idea
of
society
,
not
only
was
fatal
to
any
vital
sentiment
of
*NL*
brotherhood
and
common
interest
among
living
men
,
but
equally
to
any
*NL*
realization
of
the
responsibility
of
the
living
for
the
generation
to
*NL*
follow
.
To-day
this
sense
of
responsibility
,
practically
unrecognized
*NL*
in
all
previous
ages
,
has
become
one
of
the
great
ethical
ideas
of
the
*NL*
race
,
reinforcing
,
with
an
intense
conviction
of
duty
,
the
natural
*NL*
impulse
to
seek
in
marriage
the
best
and
noblest
of
the
other
sex
.
The
*NL*
result
is
,
that
not
all
the
encouragements
and
incentives
of
every
*NL*
sort
which
we
have
provided
to
develop
industry
,
talent
,
genius
,
*NL*
excellence
of
whatever
kind
,
are
comparable
in
their
effect
on
our
*NL*
young
men
with
the
fact
that
our
women
sit
aloft
as
judges
of
the
*NL*
race
and
reserve
themselves
to
reward
the
winners
.
Of
all
the
whips
,
*NL*
and
spurs
,
and
baits
,
and
prizes
,
there
is
none
like
the
thought
of
*NL*
the
radiant
faces
which
the
laggards
will
find
averted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Celibates
nowadays
are
almost
invariably
men
who
have
failed
to
*NL*
acquit
themselves
creditably
in
the
work
of
life
.
The
woman
must
be
a
*NL*
courageous
one
,
with
a
very
evil
sort
of
courage
,
too
,
whom
pity
for
*NL*
one
of
these
unfortunates
should
lead
to
defy
the
opinion
of
her
*NL*
generation
--
for
otherwise
she
is
free
--
so
far
as
to
accept
him
for
a
*NL*
husband
.
I
should
add
that
,
more
exacting
and
difficult
to
resist
than
*NL*
any
other
element
in
that
opinion
,
she
would
find
the
sentiment
of
her
*NL*
own
sex
.
Our
women
have
risen
to
the
full
height
of
their
*NL*
responsibility
as
the
wardens
of
the
world
to
come
,
to
whose
keeping
*NL*
the
keys
of
the
future
are
confided
.
Their
feeling
of
duty
in
this
*NL*
respect
amounts
to
a
sense
of
religious
consecration

It
is
a
cult
in
*NL*
which
they
educate
their
daughters
from
childhood
.

After
going
to
my
room
that
night
,
I
sat
up
late
to
read
a
romance
of
*NL*
Berrian
,
handed
me
by
Dr.
Leete
,
the
plot
of
which
turned
on
a
*NL*
situation
suggested
by
his
last
words
,
concerning
the
modern
view
of
*NL*
parental
responsibility
.
A
similar
situation
would
almost
certainly
*NL*
have
been
treated
by
a
nineteenth
century
romancist
so
as
to
excite
*NL*
the
morbid
sympathy
of
the
reader
with
the
sentimental
selfishness
of
*NL*
the
lovers
,
and
his
resentment
toward
the
unwritten
law
which
they
*NL*
outraged
.
I
need
not
describe
--
for
who
has
not
read
``
Ruth
Elton

''
--
how
*NL*
different
is
the
course
which
Berrian
takes
,
and
with
what
tremendous
*NL*
effect
he
enforces
the
principle
which
he
states
:
``
Over
the
unborn
our
*NL*
power
is
that
of
God
,
and
our
responsibility
like
His
toward
us

As
we

acquit
ourselves
toward
them

deal

CHAPTER
XXVI
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
think
if
a
person
were
ever
excusable
for
losing
track
of
the
days
*NL*
of
the
week
,
the
circumstances
excused
me
.
Indeed
,
if
I
had
been
told
*NL*
that
the
method
of
reckoning
time
had
been
wholly
changed
and
the
days
*NL*
were
now
counted
in
lots
of
five
,
ten
,
or
fifteen
instead
of
seven
,
I
*NL*
should
have
been
in
no
way
surprised
after
what
I
had
already
heard
*NL*
and
seen
of
the
twentieth
century
.
The
first
time
that
any
inquiry
as
*NL*
to
the
days
of
the
week
occurred
to
me
was
the
morning
following
the
*NL*
conversation
related
in
the
last
chapter
.
At
the
breakfast
table
Dr.
*NL*
Leete
asked
me
if
I
would
care
to
hear
a
sermon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Sunday
,
then
?
''
I
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
replied
.
``
It
was
on
Friday
,
you
see
,
when
we
made
the
lucky
*NL*
discovery
of
the
buried
chamber
to
which
we
owe
your
society
this
*NL*
morning
.
It
was
on
Saturday
morning
,
soon
after
midnight
,
that
you
*NL*
first
awoke
,
and
Sunday
afternoon
when
you
awoke
the
second
time
with
*NL*
faculties
fully
regained
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
still
have
Sundays
and
sermons
,
''
I
said
.
``
We
had
prophets
who
*NL*
foretold
that
long
before
this
time
the
world
would
have
dispensed
*NL*
with
both
.
I
am
very
curious
to
know
how
the
ecclesiastical
systems
*NL*
fit
in
with
the
rest
of
your
social
arrangements
.
I
suppose
you
have
a
*NL*
sort
of
national
church
with
official
clergymen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
laughed
,
and
Mrs.
Leete
and
Edith
seemed
greatly
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Mr.
West
,
''
Edith
said
,
``
what
odd
people
you
must
think
us
.
You
*NL*
were
quite
done
with
national
religious
establishments
in
the
*NL*
nineteenth
century
,
and
did
you
fancy
we
had
gone
back
to
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
can
voluntary
churches
and
an
unofficial
clerical
profession
*NL*
be
reconciled
with
national
ownership
of
all
buildings
,
and
the
*NL*
industrial
service
required
of
all
men
?
''
I
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
religious
practices
of
the
people
have
naturally
changed
*NL*
considerably
in
a
century
,
''
replied
Dr.
Leete
;
``
but
supposing
them
to
*NL*
have
remained
unchanged
,
our
social
system
would
accommodate
them
*NL*
perfectly
.
The
nation
supplies
any
person
or
number
of
persons
with
*NL*
buildings
on
guarantee
of
the
rent
,
and
they
remain
tenants
while
they
*NL*
pay
it
.
As
for
the
clergymen
,
if
a
number
of
persons
wish
the
services
*NL*
of
an
individual
for
any
particular
end
of
their
own
,
apart
from
the
*NL*
general
service
of
the
nation
,
they
can
always
secure
it
,
with
that
*NL*
individual
's
own
consent
,
of
course
,
just
as
we
secure
the
service
of
*NL*
our
editors
,
by
contributing
from
their
credit-cards
an
indemnity
to
*NL*
the
nation
for
the
loss
of
his
services
in
general
industry
.
This
*NL*
indemnity
paid
the
nation
for
the
individual
answers
to
the
salary
in
*NL*
your
day
paid
to
the
individual
himself
;
and
the
various
applications
*NL*
of
this
principle
leave
private
initiative
full
play
in
all
details
to
*NL*
which
national
control
is
not
applicable
.
Now
,
as
to
hearing
a
sermon
*NL*
to-day
,
if
you
wish
to
do
so
,
you
can
either
go
to
a
church
to
hear
it
*NL*
or
stay
at
home
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
am
I
to
hear
it
if
I
stay
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
by
accompanying
us
to
the
music
room
at
the
proper
hour
and
*NL*
selecting
an
easy
chair
.
There
are
some
who
still
prefer
to
hear
*NL*
sermons
in
church
,
but
most
of
our
preaching
,
like
our
musical
*NL*

is
not
in
public
,
but
delivered
in
acoustically

If

I
shall
be
glad

accompany
you

I
really
do
n't

you
are

hear

a

An
hour
or
two
later
,
as
I
sat
reading
in
the
library

Edith
came
for

me
,
and
I
followed
her
to
the
music
room

Dr.

We
had
not
more
than
seated
ourselves
comfortably
when
*NL*
the
tinkle
of
a
bell
was
heard
,
and
a
few
moments
after
the
voice
of
a
*NL*
man
,
at
the
pitch
of
ordinary
conversation
,
addressed
us
,
with
an
*NL*
effect
of
proceeding
from
an
invisible
person
in
the
room

This
was

what
the

said

``
We
have
had
among
us

during

a
critic
from
the

nineteenth

representative
of
the
epoch

our

great-grandparents

It
would
be
strange
if
a

not

the
lines
Mr.
Barton
is
*NL*
laying
down
,
and
if
so
,
you
need
not
be
cheated
out
of
a
sermon
.
She
*NL*
will
connect
us
with
Mr.
Sweetser
's
speaking
room
if
you
say
so
,
and
I
*NL*
can
still
promise
you
a
very
good
discourse
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
said

``
Believe
me
,
I
would
much
rather
hear
what
Mr.

Barton
has
to
say

*NL*
*NL*
``
As
you

my

*NL*
*NL*
When
her
father
spoke
to
me
Edith
had
touched
a
screw
,
and
the
voice
*NL*
of
Mr.
Barton
had
ceased
abruptly
.
Now
at
another
touch
the
room
was
*NL*
once
more
filled
with
the
earnest
sympathetic
tones
which
had
already
*NL*
impressed
me
most
favorably
.

*NL*
``
I
venture
to
assume
that
one
effect
has
been
common
with
us
as
a
*NL*
result
of
this
effort
at
retrospection
,
and
that
it
has
been
to
leave
*NL*
us
more
than
ever
amazed
at
the
stupendous
change
which
one
brief
*NL*
century
has
made
in
the
material
and
moral
conditions
of
humanity
.
*NL*

``
Still
,
as
regards
the
contrast
between
the
poverty
of
the
nation
and
*NL*
the
world
in
the
nineteenth
century
and
their
wealth
now
,
it
is
not
*NL*
greater
,
possibly
,
than
had
been
before
seen
in
human
history
,
perhaps
*NL*
not
greater
,
for
example
,
than
that
between
the
poverty
of
this
*NL*
country
during
the
earliest
colonial
period
of
the
seventeenth
century
*NL*
and
the
relatively
great
wealth
it
had
attained
at
the
close
of
the
*NL*
nineteenth
,
or
between
the
England
of
William
the
Conqueror
and
that
*NL*
of
Victoria
.
Although
the
aggregate
riches
of
a
nation
did
not
then
,
*NL*
as
now
,
afford
any
accurate
criterion
of
the
masses
of
its
people
,
yet
*NL*
instances
like
these
afford
partial
parallels
for
the
merely
material
*NL*
side
of
the
contrast
between
the
nineteenth
and
the
twentieth
*NL*
centuries
.
It
is
when
we
contemplate
the
moral
aspect
of
that
contrast
*NL*
that
we
find
ourselves
in
the
presence
of
a
phenomenon
for
which
*NL*
history
offers
no
precedent
,
however
far
back
we
may
cast
our
eye
.
One
*NL*
might
almost
be
excused
who
should
exclaim
,
`
Here
,
surely
,
is
*NL*
something
like
a
miracle
!
'
Nevertheless
,
when
we
give
over
idle
*NL*
wonder
,
and
begin
to
examine
the
seeming
prodigy
critically
,
we
find
*NL*
it
no
prodigy
at
all
,
much
less
a
miracle
.
It
is
not
necessary
to
*NL*
suppose
a
moral
new
birth
of
humanity
,
or
a
wholesale
destruction
of
*NL*
the
wicked
and
survival
of
the
good
,
to
account
for
the
fact
before
*NL*
us
.
It
finds
its
simple
and
obvious
explanation
in
the
reaction
of
a
*NL*
changed
environment
upon
human
nature
.
It
means
merely
that
a
form
of
*NL*
society
which
was
founded
on
the
pseudo
self-interest
of
selfishness
,
*NL*
and
appealed
solely
to
the
anti-social
and
brutal
side
of
human
*NL*
nature
,
has
been
replaced
by
institutions
based
on
the
true
*NL*
self-interest
of
a
rational
unselfishness
,
and
appealing
to
the
social
*NL*
and
generous
instincts
of
men
.

*NL*
``
My
friends
,
if
you
would
see
men
again
the
beasts
of
prey
they
seemed
*NL*
in
the
nineteenth
century
,
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
restore
the
old
*NL*
social
and
industrial
system
,
which
taught
them
to
view
their
natural
*NL*
prey
in
their
fellow-men
,
and
find
their
gain
in
the
loss
of
others
.
*NL*
No
doubt
it
seems
to
you
that
no
necessity
,
however
dire
,
would
have
*NL*
tempted
you
to
subsist
on
what
superior
skill
or
strength
enabled
you
*NL*
to
wrest
from
others
equally
needy
.
But
suppose
it
were
not
merely
*NL*
your
own
life
that
you
were
responsible
for
.
I
know
well
that
there
*NL*
must
have
been
many
a
man
among
our
ancestors
who
,
if
it
had
been
*NL*
merely
a
question
of
his
own
life
,
would
sooner
have
given
it
up
than
*NL*
nourished
it
by
bread
snatched
from
others
.
But
this
he
was
not
*NL*
permitted
to
do
.
He
had
dear
lives
dependent
on
him
.
Men
loved
women
*NL*
in
those
days
,
as
now
.
God
knows
how
they
dared
be
fathers
,
but
they
*NL*
had
babies
as
sweet
,
no
doubt
,
to
them
as
ours
to
us
,
whom
they
must
*NL*
feed
,
clothe
,
educate
.
The
gentlest
creatures
are
fierce
when
they
*NL*
have
young
to
provide
for
,
and
in
that
wolfish
society
the
struggle
*NL*
for
bread
borrowed
a
peculiar
desperation
from
the
tenderest
*NL*
sentiments
.
For
the
sake
of
those
dependent
on
him
,
a
man
might
not
*NL*
choose
,
but
must
plunge
into
the
foul
fight
,
--
cheat
,
overreach
,
*NL*
supplant
,
defraud
,
buy
below
worth
and
sell
above
,
break
down
the
*NL*
business
by
which
his
neighbor
fed
his
young
ones
,
tempt
men
to
buy
*NL*
what
they
ought
not
and
to
sell
what
they
should
not
,
grind
his
*NL*
laborers
,
sweat
his
debtors
,
cozen
his
creditors
.
Though
a
man
sought
*NL*
it
carefully
with
tears
,
it
was
hard
to
find
a
way
in
which
he
could
*NL*
earn
a
living
and
provide
for
his
family
except
by
pressing
in
before
*NL*
some
weaker
rival
and
taking
the
food
from
his
mouth
.
Even
the
*NL*
ministers
of
religion
were
not
exempt
from
this
cruel
necessity
.
While
*NL*
they
warned
their
flocks
against
the
love
of
money
,
regard
for
their
*NL*
families
compelled
them
to
keep
an
outlook
for
the
pecuniary
prizes
of
*NL*
their
calling
.
Poor
fellows
,
theirs
was
indeed
a
trying
business
,
*NL*
preaching
to
men
a
generosity
and
unselfishness
which
they
and
*NL*
everybody
knew
would
,
in
the
existing
state
of
the
world
,
reduce
to
*NL*
poverty
those
who
should
practice
them
,
laying
down
laws
of
conduct
*NL*
which
the
law
of
self-preservation
compelled
men
to
break
.
Looking
on
*NL*
the
inhuman
spectacle
of
society
,
these
worthy
men
bitterly
bemoaned
*NL*
the
depravity
of
human
nature
;
as
if
angelic
nature
would
not
have
*NL*
been
debauched
in
such
a
devil
's
school
!
Ah
,
my
friends
,
believe
me
,
*NL*
it
is
not
now
in
this
happy
age
that
humanity
is
proving
the
divinity
*NL*
within
it
.
It
was
rather
in
those
evil
days
when
not
even
the
fight
*NL*
for
life
with
one
another
,
the
struggle
for
mere
existence
,
in
which
*NL*
mercy
was
folly
,
could
wholly
banish
generosity
and
kindness
from
the
*NL*
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
hard
to
understand
the
desperation
with
which
men
and
*NL*
women
,
who
under
other
conditions
would
have
been
full
of
gentleness
*NL*
and
ruth
,
fought
and
tore
each
other
in
the
scramble
for
gold
,
when
we
*NL*
realize
what
it
meant
to
miss
it
,
what
poverty
was
in
that
day
.
For
*NL*
the
body
it
was
hunger
and
thirst
,
torment
by
heat
and
frost
,
in
*NL*
sickness
neglect
,
in
health
unremitting
toil
;
for
the
moral
nature
it
*NL*
meant
oppression
,
contempt
,
and
the
patient
endurance
of
indignity
,
*NL*
brutish
associations
from
infancy
,
the
loss
of
all
the
innocence
of
*NL*
childhood
,
the
grace
of
womanhood
,
the
dignity
of
manhood
;
for
the
*NL*
mind
it
meant
the
death
of
ignorance
,
the
torpor
of
all
those
*NL*
faculties
which
distinguish
us
from
brutes
,
the
reduction
of
life

a
*NL*
round

bodily

alternative

``
Some
two
or
three
centuries
ago
an
act
of
barbarity
was
committed
in
*NL*
India
,
which
,
though
the
number
of
lives
destroyed
was
but
a
few
*NL*
score
,
was
attended
by
such
peculiar
horrors
that
its
memory
is
likely
*NL*
to
be
perpetual
.
A
number
of
English
prisoners
were
shut
up
in
a
room
*NL*
containing
not
enough
air
to
supply
one-tenth
their
number
.
The
*NL*
unfortunates
were
gallant
men
,
devoted
comrades
in
service
,
but
,
as
*NL*
the
agonies
of
suffocation
began
to
take
hold
on
them
,
they
forgot
all
*NL*
else
,
and
became
involved
in
a
hideous
struggle
,
each
one
for
himself
,
*NL*
and
against
all
others
,
to
force
a
way
to
one
of
the
small
apertures
*NL*
of
the
prison
at
which
alone
it
was
possible
to
get
a
breath
of
air
.
*NL*
It
was
a
struggle
in
which
men
became
beasts
,
and
the
recital
of
its
*NL*
horrors
by
the
few
survivors
so
shocked
our
forefathers
that
for
a
*NL*
century
later
we
find
it
a
stock
reference
in
their
literature
as
a
*NL*
typical
illustration
of
the
extreme
possibilities
of
human
misery
,
as
*NL*
shocking
in
its
moral
as
its
physical
aspect
.
They
could
scarcely
have
*NL*
anticipated
that
to
us
the
Black
Hole
of
Calcutta
,
with
its
press
of
*NL*
maddened
men
tearing
and
trampling
one
another
in
the
struggle
to
win
*NL*
a
place
at
the
breathing
holes
,
would
seem
a
striking
type
of
the
*NL*
society
of
their
age
.
It
lacked
something
of
being
a
complete
type
,
*NL*
however
,
for
in
the
Calcutta
Black
Hole
there
were
no
tender
women
,
no
*NL*
little
children
and
old
men
and
women
,
no
cripples
.
They
were
at
least
*NL*
all
men
,
strong
to
bear
,
who
suffered
.

*NL*
``
When
we
reflect
that
the
ancient
order
of
which
I
have
been
speaking
*NL*
was
prevalent
up
to
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
while
to
us
the
*NL*
new
order
which
succeeded
it
already
seems
antique
,
even
our
parents
*NL*
having
known
no
other
,
we
can
not
fail
to
be
astounded
at
the
*NL*
suddenness
with
which
a
transition
so
profound
beyond
all
previous
*NL*
experience
of
the
race
must
have
been
effected
.
Some
observation
of
*NL*
the
state
of
men
's
minds
during
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
will
,
however
,
in
great
measure
,
dissipate
this
astonishment
.
*NL*
Though
general
intelligence
in
the
modern
sense
could
not
be
said
to
*NL*
exist
in
any
community
at
that
time
,
yet
,
as
compared
with
previous
*NL*
generations
,
the
one
then
on
the
stage
was
intelligent
.
The
inevitable
*NL*
consequence
of
even
this
comparative
degree
of
intelligence
had
been
a
*NL*
perception
of
the
evils
of
society
,
such
as
had
never
before
been
*NL*
general
.
It
is
quite
true
that
these
evils
had
been
even
worse
,
much
*NL*
worse
,
in
previous
ages
.
It
was
the
increased
intelligence
of
the
*NL*
masses
which
made
the
difference
,
as
the
dawn
reveals
the
squalor
of
*NL*
surroundings
which
in
the
darkness
may
have
seemed
tolerable
.
The
*NL*
keynote
of
the
literature
of
the
period
was
one
of
compassion
for
the
*NL*
poor
and
unfortunate
,
and
indignant
outcry
against
the
failure
of
the
*NL*
social
machinery
to
ameliorate
the
miseries
of
men
.
It
is
plain
from
*NL*
these
outbursts
that
the
moral
hideousness
of
the
spectacle
about
them
*NL*
was
,
at
least
by
flashes
,
fully
realized
by
the
best
of
the
men
of
*NL*
that
time
,
and
that
the
lives
of
some
of
the
more
sensitive
and
*NL*
generous
hearted
of
them
were
rendered
wellnigh
unendurable
by
the
*NL*
intensity
of
their
sympathies
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Although
the
idea
of
the
vital
unity
of
the
family
of
mankind
,
the
*NL*
reality
of
human
brotherhood
,
was
very
far
from
being
apprehended
by
*NL*
them
as
the
moral
axiom
it
seems
to
us
,
yet
it
is
a
mistake
to
suppose
*NL*
that
there
was
no
feeling
at
all
corresponding
to
it
.
I
could
read
you
*NL*
passages
of
great
beauty
from
some
of
their
writers
which
show
that
*NL*
the
conception
was
clearly
attained
by
a
few
,
and
no
doubt
vaguely
by
*NL*
many
more
.
Moreover
,
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
was
in
name
Christian
,
and
the
fact
that
the
entire
commercial
*NL*
and
industrial
frame
of
society
was
the
embodiment
of
the
*NL*
anti-Christian
spirit
must
have
had
some
weight
,
though
I
admit
it
was
*NL*
strangely
little
,
with
the
nominal
followers
of
Jesus
Christ

When
we
inquire
why
it
did
not
have
more
,
why
,
in
general
,
long
after
*NL*
a
vast
majority
of
men
had
agreed
as
to
the
crying
abuses
of
the
*NL*
existing
social
arrangement
,
they
still
tolerated
it
,
or
contented
*NL*
themselves
with
talking
of
petty
reforms
in
it
,
we
come
upon
an
*NL*
extraordinary
fact
.
It
was
the
sincere
belief
of
even
the
best
of
men
*NL*
at
that
epoch
that
the
only
stable
elements
in
human
nature
,
on
which
*NL*
a
social
system
could
be
safely
founded
,
were
its
worst
propensities
.
*NL*
They
had
been
taught
and
believed
that
greed
and
self-seeking
were
all
*NL*
that
held
mankind
together
,
and
that
all
human
associations
would
fall
*NL*
to
pieces
if
anything
were
done
to
blunt
the
edge
of
these
motives
or
*NL*
curb
their
operation
.
In
a
word
,
they
believed
--
even
those
who
longed
*NL*
to
believe
otherwise
--
the
exact
reverse
of
what
seems
to
us
*NL*
self-evident
;
they
believed
,
that
is
,
that
the
anti-social
qualities
*NL*
of
men
,
and
not
their
social
qualities
,
were
what
furnished
the
*NL*
cohesive
force
of
society
.
It
seemed
reasonable
to
them
that
men
lived
*NL*
together
solely
for
the
purpose
of
overreaching
and
oppressing
one
*NL*
another
,
and
of
being
overreached
and
oppressed
,
and
that
while
a
*NL*
society
that
gave
full
scope
to
these
propensities
could
stand
,
there
*NL*
would
be
little
chance
for
one
based
on
the
idea
of
cooperation
for
*NL*
the
benefit
of
all
.
It
seems
absurd
to
expect
any
one
to
believe
that
*NL*
convictions
like
these
were
ever
seriously
entertained
by
men
;
but
*NL*
that
they
were
not
only
entertained
by
our
great-grandfathers
,
but
*NL*
were
responsible
for
the
long
delay
in
doing
away
with
the
ancient
*NL*
order
,
after
a
conviction
of
its
intolerable
abuses
had
become
*NL*
general
,
is
as
well
established
as
any
fact
in
history
can
be
.
Just
*NL*
here
you
will
find
the
explanation
of
the
profound
pessimism
of
the
*NL*
literature
of
the
last
quarter
of
the
nineteenth
century
,
the
note
of
*NL*
melancholy
in
its
poetry
,
and
the
cynicism
of
its
humor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Feeling
that
the
condition
of
the
race
was
unendurable
,
they
had
no
*NL*
clear
hope
of
anything
better
.
They
believed
that
the
evolution
of
*NL*
humanity
had
resulted
in
leading
it
into
a
_
cul
de
sac
_
,
and
that
*NL*
there
was
no
way
of
getting
forward
.
The
frame
of
men
's
minds
at
this
*NL*
time
is
strikingly
illustrated
by
treatises
which
have
come
down
to
*NL*
us
,
and
may
even
now
be
consulted
in
our
libraries
by
the
curious
,
in
*NL*
which
laborious
arguments
are
pursued
to
prove
that
despite
the
evil
*NL*
plight
of
men
,
life
was
still
,
by
some
slight
preponderance
of
*NL*
considerations
,
probably
better
worth
living
than
leaving
.
Despising
*NL*
themselves
,
they
despised
their
Creator
.
There
was
a
general
decay
of
*NL*
religious
belief
.
Pale
and
watery
gleams
,
from
skies
thickly
veiled
by
*NL*
doubt
and
dread
,
alone
lighted
up
the
chaos
of
earth
.
That
men
should
*NL*
doubt
Him
whose
breath
is
in
their
nostrils
,
or
dread
the
hands
that
*NL*
moulded
them
,
seems
to
us
indeed
a
pitiable
insanity
;
but
we
must
*NL*
remember
that
children
who
are
brave
by
day
have
sometimes
foolish
*NL*
fears
at
night
.
The
dawn
has
come
since
then
.
It
is
very
easy
to
*NL*
believe
in
the
fatherhood
of
God
in
the
twentieth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Briefly
,
as
must
needs
be
in
a
discourse
of
this
character
,
I
have
*NL*
adverted
to
some
of
the
causes
which
had
prepared
men
's
minds
for
the
*NL*
change
from
the
old
to
the
new
order
,
as
well
as
some
causes
of
the
*NL*
conservatism
of
despair
which
for
a
while
held
it
back
after
the
time
*NL*
was
ripe
.
To
wonder
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
change
was
*NL*
completed
after
its
possibility
was
first
entertained
is
to
forget
the
*NL*
intoxicating
effect
of
hope
upon
minds
long
accustomed
to
despair
.
The
*NL*
sunburst
,
after
so
long
and
dark
a
night
,
must
needs
have
had
a
*NL*
dazzling
effect
.
From
the
moment
men
allowed
themselves
to
believe
*NL*
that
humanity
after
all
had
not
been
meant
for
a
dwarf
,
that
its
squat
*NL*
stature
was
not
the
measure
of
its
possible
growth
,
but
that
it
stood
*NL*
upon
the
verge
of
an
avatar
of
limitless
development
,
the
reaction
*NL*
must
needs
have
been
overwhelming
.
It
is
evident
that
nothing
was
able
*NL*
to
stand
against
the
enthusiasm
which
the
new
faith
inspired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
at
last
,
men
must
have
felt
,
was
a
cause
compared
with
which
*NL*
the
grandest
of
historic
causes
had
been
trivial
.
It
was
doubtless
*NL*
because
it
could
have
commanded
millions
of
martyrs
,
that
none
were
*NL*
needed
.
The
change
of
a
dynasty
in
a
petty
kingdom
of
the
old
world
*NL*
often
cost
more
lives
than
did
the
revolution
which
set
the
feet
of
*NL*
the
human
race
at
last
in
the
right
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Doubtless
it
ill
beseems
one
to
whom
the
boon
of
life
in
our
*NL*
resplendent
age
has
been
vouchsafed
to
wish
his
destiny
other
,
and
yet
*NL*
I
have
often
thought
that
I
would
fain
exchange
my
share
in
this
*NL*
serene
and
golden
day
for
a
place
in
that
stormy
epoch
of
transition
,
*NL*
when
heroes
burst
the
barred
gate
of
the
future
and
revealed
to
the
*NL*
kindling
gaze
of
a
hopeless
race
,
in
place
of
the
blank
wall
that
had
*NL*
closed
its
path
,
a
vista
of
progress
whose
end
,
for
very
excess
of
*NL*
light
,
still
dazzles
us
.
Ah
,
my
friends
!
who
will
say
that
to
have
*NL*
lived
then
,
when
the
weakest
influence
was
a
lever
to
whose
touch
the
*NL*
centuries
trembled
,
was
not
worth
a
share
even
in
this
era
of
*NL*
fruition
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
the
story
of
that
last
,
greatest
,
and
most
bloodless
of
*NL*
revolutions
.
In
the
time
of
one
generation
men
laid
aside
the
social
*NL*
traditions
and
practices
of
barbarians
,
and
assumed
a
social
order
*NL*
worthy
of
rational
and
human
beings
.
Ceasing
to
be
predatory
in
their
*NL*
habits
,
they
became
co-workers
,
and
found
in
fraternity
,
at
once
,
the
*NL*
science
of
wealth
and
happiness
.
`
What
shall
I
eat
and
drink
,
and
*NL*
wherewithal
shall
I
be
clothed
?
'
stated
as
a
problem
beginning
and
*NL*
ending
in
self
,
had
been
an
anxious
and
an
endless
one
.
But
when
once
*NL*
it
was
conceived
,
not
from
the
individual
,
but
the
fraternal
*NL*
standpoint
,
`
What
shall
we
eat
and
drink
,
and
wherewithal
shall
we
be
*NL*
clothed
?
'
--
its
difficulties
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poverty
with
servitude
had
been
the
result
,
for
the
mass
of
humanity
,
*NL*
of
attempting
to
solve
the
problem
of
maintenance
from
the
individual
*NL*
standpoint
,
but
no
sooner
had
the
nation
become
the
sole
capitalist
*NL*
and
employer
than
not
alone
did
plenty
replace
poverty
,
but
the
last
*NL*
vestige
of
the
serfdom
of
man
to
man
disappeared
from
earth
.
Human
*NL*
slavery
,
so
often
vainly
scotched
,
at
last
was
killed
.
The
means
of
*NL*
subsistence
no
longer
doled
out
by
men
to
women
,
by
employer
to
*NL*
employed
,
by
rich
to
poor
,
was
distributed
from
a
common
stock
as
*NL*
among
children
at
the
father
's
table
.
It
was
impossible
for
a
man
any
*NL*
longer
to
use
his
fellow-men
as
tools
for
his
own
profit
.
His
esteem
*NL*
was
the
only
sort
of
gain
he
could
thenceforth
make
out
of
him
.
There
*NL*
was
no
more
either
arrogance
or
servility
in
the
relations
of
human
*NL*
beings
to
one
another
.
For
the
first
time
since
the
creation
every
man
*NL*
stood
up
straight
before
God
.
The
fear
of
want
and
the
lust
of
gain
*NL*
became
extinct
motives
when
abundance
was
assured
to
all
and
*NL*
immoderate
possessions
made
impossible
of
attainment
.
There
were
no
*NL*
more
beggars
nor
almoners
.
Equity
left
charity
without
an
occupation
.
*NL*
The
ten
commandments
became
wellnigh
obsolete
in
a
world
where
there
*NL*
was
no
temptation
to
theft
,
no
occasion
to
lie
either
for
fear
or
*NL*
favor
,
no
room
for
envy
where
all
were
equal
,
and
little
provocation
*NL*
to
violence
where
men
were
disarmed
of
power
to
injure
one
another
.
*NL*
Humanity
's
ancient
dream
of
liberty
,
equality
,
fraternity
,
mocked
by
*NL*
so
many
ages
,
at
last
was
realized
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
in
the
old
society
the
generous
,
the
just
,
the
tender-hearted
had
*NL*
been
placed
at
a
disadvantage
by
the
possession
of
those
qualities
,
so
*NL*
in
the
new
society
the
cold-hearted
,
the
greedy
,
and
self-seeking
*NL*
found
themselves
out
of
joint
with
the
world
.
Now
that
the
conditions
*NL*
of
life
for
the
first
time
ceased
to
operate
as
a
forcing
process
to
*NL*
develop
the
brutal
qualities
of
human
nature
,
and
the
premium
which
*NL*
had
heretofore
encouraged
selfishness
was
not
only
removed
,
but
placed
*NL*
upon
unselfishness
,
it
was
for
the
first
time
possible
to
see
what
*NL*
unperverted
human
nature
really
was
like
.
The
depraved
tendencies
,
*NL*
which
had
previously
overgrown
and
obscured
the
better
to
so
large
an
*NL*
extent
,
now
withered
like
cellar
fungi
in
the
open
air
,
and
the
nobler
*NL*
qualities
showed
a
sudden
luxuriance
which
turned
cynics
into
*NL*
panegyrists
and
for
the
first
time
in
human
history
tempted
mankind
to
*NL*
fall
in
love
with
itself
.
Soon
was
fully
revealed
,
what
the
divines
*NL*
and
philosophers
of
the
old
world
never
would
have
believed
,
that
*NL*
human
nature
in
its
essential
qualities
is
good
,
not
bad
,
that
men
by
*NL*
their
natural
intention
and
structure
are
generous
,
not
selfish
,
*NL*
pitiful
,
not
cruel
,
sympathetic
,
not
arrogant
,
godlike
in
aspirations
,
*NL*
instinct
with
divinest
impulses
of
tenderness
and
self-sacrifice
,
*NL*
images
of
God
indeed
,
not
the
travesties
upon
Him
they
had
seemed
.
The
*NL*
constant
pressure
,
through
numberless
generations
,
of
conditions
of
*NL*
life
which
might
have
perverted
angels
,
had
not
been
able
to
*NL*
essentially
alter
the
natural
nobility
of
the
stock
,
and
these
*NL*
conditions
once
removed
,
like
a
bent
tree
,
it
had
sprung
back
to
its
*NL*
normal
uprightness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
put
the
whole
matter
in
the
nutshell
of
a
parable
,
let
me
compare
*NL*
humanity
in
the
olden
time
to
a
rosebush
planted
in
a
swamp
,
watered
*NL*
with
black
bog-water
,
breathing
miasmatic
fogs
by
day
,
and
chilled
*NL*
with
poison
dews
at
night
.
Innumerable
generations
of
gardeners
had
*NL*
done
their
best
to
make
it
bloom
,
but
beyond
an
occasional
half-opened
*NL*
bud
with
a
worm
at
the
heart
,
their
efforts
had
been
unsuccessful
.
*NL*
Many
,
indeed
,
claimed
that
the
bush
was
no
rosebush
at
all
,
but
a
*NL*
noxious
shrub
,
fit
only
to
be
uprooted
and
burned
.
The
gardeners
,
for
*NL*
the
most
part
,
however
,
held
that
the
bush
belonged
to
the
rose
*NL*
family
,
but
had
some
ineradicable
taint
about
it
,
which
prevented
the
*NL*
buds
from
coming
out
,
and
accounted
for
its
generally
sickly
*NL*
condition
.
There
were
a
few
,
indeed
,
who
maintained
that
the
stock
was
*NL*
good
enough
,
that
the
trouble
was
in
the
bog
,
and
that
under
more
*NL*
favorable
conditions
the
plant
might
be
expected
to
do
better
.
But
*NL*
these
persons
were
not
regular
gardeners
,
and
being
condemned
by
the
*NL*
latter
as
mere
theorists
and
day
dreamers
,
were
for
the
most
part
,
so
*NL*
regarded
by
the
people
.
Moreover
,
urged
some
eminent
moral
*NL*
philosophers
,
even
conceding
for
the
sake
of
the
argument
that
the
*NL*
bush
might
possibly
do
better
elsewhere
,
it
was
a
more
valuable
*NL*
discipline
for
the
buds
to
try
to
bloom
in
a
bog
than
it
would
be
*NL*
under
more
favorable
conditions
.
The
buds
that
succeeded
in
opening
*NL*
might
indeed
be
very
rare
,
and
the
flowers
pale
and
scentless
,
but
*NL*
they
represented
far
more
moral
effort
than
if
they
had
bloomed
*NL*
spontaneously
in
a
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
regular
gardeners
and
the
moral
philosophers
had
their
way
.
The
*NL*
bush
remained
rooted
in
the
bog
,
and
the
old
course
of
treatment
went
*NL*
on
.
Continually
new
varieties
of
forcing
mixtures
were
applied
to
the
*NL*
roots
,
and
more
recipes
than
could
be
numbered
,
each
declared
by
its
*NL*
advocates
the
best
and
only
suitable
preparation
,
were
used
to
kill
*NL*
the
vermin
and
remove
the
mildew
.
This
went
on
a
very
long
time
.
*NL*
Occasionally
some
one
claimed
to
observe
a
slight
improvement
in
the
*NL*
appearance
of
the
bush
,
but
there
were
quite
as
many
who
declared
that
*NL*
it
did
not
look
so
well
as
it
used
to
.
On
the
whole
there
could
not
be
*NL*
said
to
be
any
marked
change
.
Finally
,
during
a
period
of
general
*NL*
despondency
as
to
the
prospects
of
the
bush
where
it
was
,
the
idea
of
*NL*
transplanting
it
was
again
mooted
,
and
this
time
found
favor
.
`
Let
us
*NL*
try
it
,
'
was
the
general
voice
.
`
Perhaps
it
may
thrive
better
*NL*
elsewhere
,
and
here
it
is
certainly
doubtful
if
it
be
worth
*NL*
cultivating
longer
.
'
So
it
came
about
that
the
rosebush
of
humanity
*NL*
was
transplanted
,
and
set
in
sweet
,
warm
,
dry
earth
,
where
the
sun
*NL*
bathed
it
,
the
stars
wooed
it
,
and
the
south
wind
caressed
it
.
Then
it
*NL*
appeared
that
it
was
indeed
a
rosebush
.
The
vermin
and
the
mildew
*NL*
disappeared
,
and
the
bush
was
covered
with
most
beautiful
red
roses
,
*NL*
whose
fragrance
filled
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pledge
of
the
destiny
appointed
for
us
that
the
Creator
has
*NL*
set
in
our
hearts
an
infinite
standard
of
achievement
,
judged
by
which
*NL*
our
past
attainments
seem
always
insignificant
,
and
the
goal
never
*NL*
nearer
.
Had
our
forefathers
conceived
a
state
of
society
in
which
men
*NL*
should
live
together
like
brethren
dwelling
in
unity
,
without
strifes
*NL*
or
envying
,
violence
or
overreaching
,
and
where
,
at
the
price
of
a
*NL*
degree
of
labor
not
greater
than
health
demands
,
in
their
chosen
*NL*
occupations
,
they
should
be
wholly
freed
from
care
for
the
morrow
and
*NL*
left
with
no
more
concern
for
their
livelihood
than
trees
which
are
*NL*
watered
by
unfailing
streams
,
--
had
they
conceived
such
a
condition
,
I
*NL*
say
,
it
would
have
seemed
to
them
nothing
less
than
paradise
.
They
*NL*
would
have
confounded
it
with
their
idea
of
heaven
,
nor
dreamed
that
*NL*
there
could
possibly
lie
further
beyond
anything
to
be
desired
or
*NL*
striven
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
is
it
with
us
who
stand
on
this
height
which
they
gazed
up
*NL*
to
?
Already
we
have
wellnigh
forgotten
,
except
when
it
is
especially
*NL*
called
to
our
minds
by
some
occasion
like
the
present
,
that
it
was
*NL*
not
always
with
men
as
it
is
now
.
It
is
a
strain
on
our
imaginations
*NL*
to
conceive
the
social
arrangements
of
our
immediate
ancestors
.
We
*NL*
find
them
grotesque
.
The
solution
of
the
problem
of
physical
*NL*
maintenance
so
as
to
banish
care
and
crime
,
so
far
from
seeming
to
us
*NL*
an
ultimate
attainment
,
appears
but
as
a
preliminary
to
anything
like
*NL*
real
human
progress
.
We
have
but
relieved
ourselves
of
an
impertinent
*NL*
and
needless
harassment
which
hindered
our
ancestors
from
undertaking
*NL*
the
real
ends
of
existence
.
We
are
merely
stripped
for
the
race
;
no
*NL*
more
.
We
are
like
a
child
which
has
just
learned
to
stand
upright
and
*NL*
to
walk
.
It
is
a
great
event
,
from
the
child
's
point
of
view
,
when
he
*NL*
first
walks
.
Perhaps
he
fancies
that
there
can
be
little
beyond
that
*NL*
achievement
,
but
a
year
later
he
has
forgotten
that
he
could
not
*NL*
always
walk
.
His
horizon
did
but
widen
when
he
rose
,
and
enlarge
as
he
*NL*
moved
.
A
great
event
indeed
,
in
one
sense
,
was
his
first
step
,
but
*NL*
only
as
a
beginning
,
not
as
the
end
.
His
true
career
was
but
then
*NL*
first
entered
on
.
The
enfranchisement
of
humanity
in
the
last
century
,
*NL*
from
mental
and
physical
absorption
in
working
and
scheming
for
the
*NL*
mere
bodily
necessities
,
may
be
regarded
as
a
species
of
second
birth
*NL*
of
the
race
,
without
which
its
first
birth
to
an
existence
that
was
*NL*
but
a
burden
would
forever
have
remained
unjustified
,
but
whereby
it
*NL*
is
now
abundantly
vindicated
.
Since
then
,
humanity
has
entered
on
a
*NL*
new
phase
of
spiritual
development
,
an
evolution
of
higher
faculties
,
*NL*
the
very
existence
of
which
in
human
nature
our
ancestors
scarcely
*NL*
suspected
.
In
place
of
the
dreary
hopelessness
of
the
nineteenth
*NL*
century
,
its
profound
pessimism
as
to
the
future
of
humanity
,
the
*NL*
animating
idea
of
the
present
age
is
an
enthusiastic
conception
of
the
*NL*
opportunities
of
our
earthly
existence
,
and
the
unbounded
*NL*
possibilities
of
human
nature
.
The
betterment
of
mankind
from
*NL*
generation
to
generation
,
physically
,
mentally
,
morally
,
is
recognized
*NL*
as
the
one
great
object
supremely
worthy
of
effort
and
of
sacrifice
.
*NL*
We
believe
the
race
for
the
first
time
to
have
entered
on
the
*NL*
realization
of
God
's
ideal
of
it
,
and
each
generation
must
now
be
a
*NL*
step
upward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
ask
what
we
look
for
when
unnumbered
generations
shall
have
*NL*
passed
away
?
I
answer
,
the
way
stretches
far
before
us
,
but
the
end
is
*NL*
lost
in
light
.
For
twofold
is
the
return
of
man
to
God
`
who
is
our
*NL*
home
,
'
the
return
of
the
individual
by
the
way
of
death
,
and
the
*NL*
return
of
the
race
by
the
fulfilment
of
the
evolution
,
when
the
divine
*NL*
secret
hidden
in
the
germ
shall
be
perfectly
unfolded
.
With
a
tear
for
*NL*
the
dark
past
,
turn
we
then
to
the
dazzling
future
,
and
,
veiling
our
*NL*
eyes
,
press
forward
.
The
long
and
weary
winter
of
the
race
is
ended
.
*NL*
Its
summer
has
begun
.
Humanity
has
burst
the
chrysalis
.
The
heavens
*NL*
are
before
it
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
never
could
tell
just
why
,
but
Sunday
afternoon
during
my
old
life
*NL*
had
been
a
time
when
I
was
peculiarly
subject
to
melancholy
,
when
the
*NL*
color
unaccountably
faded
out
of
all
the
aspects
of
life
,
and
*NL*
everything
appeared
pathetically
uninteresting
.
The
hours
,
which
in
*NL*
general
were
wont
to
bear
me
easily
on
their
wings
,
lost
the
power
of
*NL*
flight
,
and
toward
the
close
of
the
day
,
drooping
quite
to
earth
,
had
*NL*
fairly
to
be
dragged
along
by
main
strength
.
Perhaps
it
was
partly
*NL*
owing
to
the
established
association
of
ideas
that
,
despite
the
utter
*NL*
change
in
my
circumstances
,
I
fell
into
a
state
of
profound
depression
*NL*
on
the
afternoon
of
this
my
first
Sunday
in
the
twentieth
century
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
,
however
,
on
the
present
occasion
a
depression
without
*NL*
specific
cause
,
the
mere
vague
melancholy
I
have
spoken
of
,
but
a
*NL*
sentiment
suggested
and
certainly
quite
justified
by
my
position
.
The
*NL*
sermon
of
Mr.
Barton
,
with
its
constant
implication
of
the
vast
moral
*NL*
gap
between
the
century
to
which
I
belonged
and
that
in
which
I
found
*NL*
myself
,
had
had
an
effect
strongly
to
accentuate
my
sense
of
*NL*
loneliness
in
it
.
Considerately
and
philosophically
as
he
had
spoken
,
*NL*
his
words
could
scarcely
have
failed
to
leave
upon
my
mind
a
strong
*NL*
impression
of
the
mingled
pity
,
curiosity
,
and
aversion
which
I
,
as
a
*NL*
representative
of
an
abhorred
epoch
,
must
excite
in
all
around
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
extraordinary
kindness
with
which
I
had
been
treated
by
Dr.
Leete
*NL*
and
his
family
,
and
especially
the
goodness
of
Edith
,
had
hitherto
*NL*
prevented
my
fully
realizing
that
their
real
sentiment
toward
me
must
*NL*
necessarily
be
that
of
the
whole
generation
to
which
they
belonged
.
*NL*
The
recognition
of
this
,
as
regarded
Dr.
Leete
and
his
amiable
wife
,
*NL*
however
painful
,
I
might
have
endured
,
but
the
conviction
that
Edith
*NL*
must
share
their
feeling
was
more
than
I
could
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crushing
effect
with
which
this
belated
perception
of
a
fact
so
*NL*
obvious
came
to
me
opened
my
eyes
fully
to
something
which
perhaps
the
*NL*
reader
has
already
suspected
,
--
I
loved
Edith
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
it
strange
that
I
did
?
The
affecting
occasion
on
which
our
*NL*
intimacy
had
begun
,
when
her
hands
had
drawn
me
out
of
the
whirlpool
*NL*
of
madness
;
the
fact
that
her
sympathy
was
the
vital
breath
which
had
*NL*
set
me
up
in
this
new
life
and
enabled
me
to
support
it
;
my
habit
of
*NL*
looking
to
her
as
the
mediator
between
me
and
the
world
around
in
a
*NL*
sense
that
even
her
father
was
not
,
--
these
were
circumstances
that
had
*NL*
predetermined
a
result
which
her
remarkable
loveliness
of
person
and
*NL*
disposition
would
alone
have
accounted
for
.
It
was
quite
inevitable
*NL*
that
she
should
have
come
to
seem
to
me
,
in
a
sense
quite
different
*NL*
from
the
usual
experience
of
lovers
,
the
only
woman
in
this
world
.
Now
*NL*
that
I
had
become
suddenly
sensible
of
the
fatuity
of
the
hopes
I
had
*NL*
begun
to
cherish
,
I
suffered
not
merely
what
another
lover
might
,
but
*NL*
in
addition
a
desolate
loneliness
,
an
utter
forlornness
,
such
as
no
*NL*
other
lover
,
however
unhappy
,
could
have
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
hosts
evidently
saw
that
I
was
depressed
in
spirits
,
and
did
their
*NL*
best
to
divert
me
.
Edith
especially
,
I
could
see
,
was
distressed
for
*NL*
me
,
but
according
to
the
usual
perversity
of
lovers
,
having
once
been
*NL*
so
mad
as
to
dream
of
receiving
something
more
from
her
,
there
was
no
*NL*
longer
any
virtue
for
me
in
a
kindness
that
I
knew
was
only
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
nightfall
,
after
secluding
myself
in
my
room
most
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
,
I
went
into
the
garden
to
walk
about
.
The
day
was
overcast
,
*NL*
with
an
autumnal
flavor
in
the
warm
,
still
air
.
Finding
myself
near
*NL*
the
excavation
,
I
entered
the
subterranean
chamber
and
sat
down
there
.
*NL*
``
This
,
''
I
muttered
to
myself
,
``
is
the
only
home
I
have
.
Let
me
stay
*NL*
here
,
and
not
go
forth
any
more
.
''
Seeking
aid
from
the
familiar
*NL*
surroundings
,
I
endeavored
to
find
a
sad
sort
of
consolation
in
*NL*
reviving
the
past
and
summoning
up
the
forms
and
faces
that
were
about
*NL*
me
in
my
former
life
.
It
was
in
vain
.
There
was
no
longer
any
life
in
*NL*
them
.
For
nearly
one
hundred
years
the
stars
had
been
looking
down
on
*NL*
Edith
Bartlett
's
grave
,
and
the
graves
of
all
my
generation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
past
was
dead
,
crushed
beneath
a
century
's
weight
,
and
from
the
*NL*
present
I
was
shut
out
.
There
was
no
place
for
me
anywhere
.
I
was
*NL*
neither
dead
nor
properly
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
for
following
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
looked
up
.
Edith
stood
in
the
door
of
the
subterranean
room
,
*NL*
regarding
me
smilingly
,
but
with
eyes
full
of
sympathetic
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Send
me
away
if
I
am
intruding
on
you
,
''
she
said
;
``
but
we
saw
that
*NL*
you
were
out
of
spirits
,
and
you
know
you
promised
to
let
me
know
if
*NL*
that
were
so
.
You
have
not
kept
your
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
rose
and
came
to
the
door
,
trying
to
smile
,
but
making
,
I
fancy
,
*NL*
rather
sorry
work
of
it
,
for
the
sight
of
her
loveliness
brought
home
*NL*
to
me
the
more
poignantly
the
cause
of
my
wretchedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
feeling
a
little
lonely
,
that
is
all
,
''
I
said
.
``
Has
it
never
*NL*
occurred
to
you
that
my
position
is
so
much
more
utterly
alone
than
*NL*
any
human
being
's
ever
was
before
that
a
new
word
is
really
needed
to
*NL*
describe
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
must
not
talk
that
way
,
--
you
must
not
let
yourself
feel
that
*NL*
way
,
--
you
must
not
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
moistened
eyes
.
``
Are
we
not
*NL*
your
friends
?
It
is
your
own
fault
if
you
will
not
let
us
be
.
You
need
*NL*
not
be
lonely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
good
to
me
beyond
my
power
of
understanding
,
''
I
said
,
``
but
*NL*
do
n't
you
suppose
that
I
know
it
is
pity
merely
,
sweet
pity
,
but
pity
*NL*
only
.
I
should
be
a
fool
not
to
know
that
I
can
not
seem
to
you
as
*NL*
other
men
of
your
own
generation
do
,
but
as
some
strange
uncanny
*NL*
being
,
a
stranded
creature
of
an
unknown
sea
,
whose
forlornness
*NL*
touches
your
compassion
despite
its
grotesqueness
.
I
have
been
so
*NL*
foolish
,
you
were
so
kind
,
as
to
almost
forget
that
this
must
needs
be
*NL*
so
,
and
to
fancy
I
might
in
time
become
naturalized
,
as
we
used
to
*NL*
say
,
in
this
age
,
so
as
to
feel
like
one
of
you
and
to
seem
to
you
*NL*
like
the
other
men
about
you
.
But
Mr.
Barton
's
sermon
taught
me
how
*NL*
vain
such
a
fancy
is
,
how
great
the
gulf
between
us
must
seem
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
miserable
sermon
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
fairly
crying
now
in
her
*NL*
sympathy
,
``
I
wanted
you
not
to
hear
it
.
What
does
he
know
of
you
?
He
*NL*
has
read
in
old
musty
books
about
your
times
,
that
is
all
.
What
do
you
*NL*
care
about
him
,
to
let
yourself
be
vexed
by
anything
he
said
?
Is
n't
it
*NL*
anything
to
you
,
that
we
who
know
you
feel
differently
?
Do
n't
you
care
*NL*
more
about
what
we
think
of
you
than
what
he
does
who
never
saw
you
?
*NL*
Oh
,
Mr.
West
!
you
do
n't
know
,
you
ca
n't
think
,
how
it
makes
me
feel
to
*NL*
see
you
so
forlorn
.
I
ca
n't
have
it
so
.
What
can
I
say
to
you
?
How
can
*NL*
I
convince
you
how
different
our
feeling
for
you
is
from
what
you
*NL*
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
before
,
in
that
other
crisis
of
my
fate
when
she
had
come
to
me
,
*NL*
she
extended
her
hands
towards
me
in
a
gesture
of
helpfulness
,
and
,
as
*NL*
then
,
I
caught
and
held
them
in
my
own
;
her
bosom
heaved
with
strong
*NL*
emotion
,
and
little
tremors
in
the
fingers
which
I
clasped
emphasized
*NL*
the
depth
of
her
feeling
.
In
her
face
,
pity
contended
in
a
sort
of
*NL*
divine
spite
against
the
obstacles
which
reduced
it
to
impotence
.
*NL*
Womanly
compassion
surely
never
wore
a
guise
more
lovely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
beauty
and
such
goodness
quite
melted
me
,
and
it
seemed
that
the
*NL*
only
fitting
response
I
could
make
was
to
tell
her
just
the
truth
.
Of
*NL*
course
I
had
not
a
spark
of
hope
,
but
on
the
other
hand
I
had
no
fear
*NL*
that
she
would
be
angry
.
She
was
too
pitiful
for
that
.
So
I
said
*NL*
presently
,
``
It
is
very
ungrateful
in
me
not
to
be
satisfied
with
such
*NL*
kindness
as
you
have
shown
me
,
and
are
showing
me
now
.
But
are
you
so
*NL*
blind
as
not
to
see
why
they
are
not
enough
to
make
me
happy
?
Do
n't
*NL*
you
see
that
it
is
because
I
have
been
mad
enough
to
love
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
my
last
words
she
blushed
deeply
and
her
eyes
fell
before
mine
,
but
*NL*
she
made
no
effort
to
withdraw
her
hands
from
my
clasp
.
For
some
*NL*
moments
she
stood
so
,
panting
a
little
.
Then
blushing
deeper
than
*NL*
ever
,
but
with
a
dazzling
smile
,
she
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
it
is
not
you
who
are
blind
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
,
but
it
was
enough
,
for
it
told
me
that
,
unaccountable
,
*NL*
incredible
as
it
was
,
this
radiant
daughter
of
a
golden
age
had
*NL*
bestowed
upon
me
not
alone
her
pity
,
but
her
love
.
Still
,
I
half
*NL*
believed
I
must
be
under
some
blissful
hallucination
even
as
I
clasped
*NL*
her
in
my
arms
.
``
If
I
am
beside
myself
,
''
I
cried
,
``
let
me
remain
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
I
whom
you
must
think
beside
myself
,
''
she
panted
,
escaping
from
*NL*
my
arms
when
I
had
barely
tasted
the
sweetness
of
her
lips
.
``
Oh
!
oh
!
*NL*
what
must
you
think
of
me
almost
to
throw
myself
in
the
arms
of
one
I
*NL*
have
known
but
a
week
?
I
did
not
mean
that
you
should
find
it
out
so
*NL*
soon
,
but
I
was
so
sorry
for
you
I
forgot
what
I
was
saying
.
No
,
no
;
*NL*
you
must
not
touch
me
again
till
you
know
who
I
am
.
After
that
,
sir
,
*NL*
you
shall
apologize
to
me
very
humbly
for
thinking
,
as
I
know
you
do
,
*NL*
that
I
have
been
over
quick
to
fall
in
love
with
you
.
After
you
know
*NL*
who
I
am
,
you
will
be
bound
to
confess
that
it
was
nothing
less
than
*NL*
my
duty
to
fall
in
love
with
you
at
first
sight
,
and
that
no
girl
of
*NL*
proper
feeling
in
my
place
could
do
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
may
be
supposed
,
I
would
have
been
quite
content
to
waive
*NL*
explanations
,
but
Edith
was
resolute
that
there
should
be
no
more
*NL*
kisses
until
she
had
been
vindicated
from
all
suspicion
of
*NL*
precipitancy
in
the
bestowal
of
her
affections
,
and
I
was
fain
to
*NL*
follow
the
lovely
enigma
into
the
house
.
Having
come
where
her
mother
*NL*
was
,
she
blushingly
whispered
something
in
her
ear
and
ran
away
,
*NL*
leaving
us
together
.
It
then
appeared
that
,
strange
as
my
experience
*NL*
had
been
,
I
was
now
first
to
know
what
was
perhaps
its
strangest
*NL*
feature
.
From
Mrs.
Leete
I
learned
that
Edith
was
the
great-granddaughter
*NL*
of
no
other
than
my
lost
love
,
Edith
Bartlett
.
After
mourning
me
for
*NL*
fourteen
years
,
she
had
made
a
marriage
of
esteem
,
and
left
a
son
who
*NL*
had
been
Mrs.
Leete
's
father
.
Mrs.
Leete
had
never
seen
her
*NL*
grandmother
,
but
had
heard
much
of
her
,
and
,
when
her
daughter
was
*NL*
born
,
gave
her
the
name
of
Edith
.
This
fact
might
have
tended
to
*NL*
increase
the
interest
which
the
girl
took
,
as
she
grew
up
,
in
all
that
*NL*
concerned
her
ancestress
,
and
especially
the
tragic
story
of
the
*NL*
supposed
death
of
the
lover
,
whose
wife
she
expected
to
be
,
in
the
*NL*
conflagration
of
his
house
.
It
was
a
tale
well
calculated
to
touch
the
*NL*
sympathy
of
a
romantic
girl
,
and
the
fact
that
the
blood
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
heroine
was
in
her
own
veins
naturally
heightened
Edith
's
*NL*
interest
in
it
.
A
portrait
of
Edith
Bartlett
and
some
of
her
papers
,
*NL*
including
a
packet
of
my
own
letters
,
were
among
the
family
heirlooms
.
*NL*
The
picture
represented
a
very
beautiful
young
woman
about
whom
it
was
*NL*
easy
to
imagine
all
manner
of
tender
and
romantic
things
.
My
letters
*NL*
gave
Edith
some
material
for
forming
a
distinct
idea
of
my
*NL*
personality
,
and
both
together
sufficed
to
make
the
sad
old
story
very
*NL*
real
to
her
.
She
used
to
tell
her
parents
,
half
jestingly
,
that
she
*NL*
would
never
marry
till
she
found
a
lover
like
Julian
West
,
and
there
*NL*
were
none
such
nowadays
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
all
this
,
of
course
,
was
merely
the
daydreaming
of
a
girl
whose
*NL*
mind
had
never
been
taken
up
by
a
love
affair
of
her
own
,
and
would
*NL*
have
had
no
serious
consequence
but
for
the
discovery
that
morning
of
*NL*
the
buried
vault
in
her
father
's
garden
and
the
revelation
of
the
*NL*
identity
of
its
inmate
.
For
when
the
apparently
lifeless
form
had
been
*NL*
borne
into
the
house
,
the
face
in
the
locket
found
upon
the
breast
was
*NL*
instantly
recognized
as
that
of
Edith
Bartlett
,
and
by
that
fact
,
*NL*
taken
in
connection
with
the
other
circumstances
,
they
knew
that
I
was
*NL*
no
other
than
Julian
West
.
Even
had
there
been
no
thought
,
as
at
first
*NL*
there
was
not
,
of
my
resuscitation
,
Mrs.
Leete
said
she
believed
that
*NL*
this
event
would
have
affected
her
daughter
in
a
critical
and
*NL*
life-long
manner
.
The
presumption
of
some
subtle
ordering
of
destiny
,
*NL*
involving
her
fate
with
mine
,
would
under
all
circumstances
have
*NL*
possessed
an
irresistible
fascination
for
almost
any
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
when
I
came
back
to
life
a
few
hours
afterward
,
and
from
the
*NL*
first
seemed
to
turn
to
her
with
a
peculiar
dependence
and
to
find
a
*NL*
special
solace
in
her
company
,
she
had
been
too
quick
in
giving
her
*NL*
love
at
the
first
sign
of
mine
,
I
could
now
,
her
mother
said
,
judge
*NL*
for
myself
.
If
I
thought
so
,
I
must
remember
that
this
,
after
all
,
was
*NL*
the
twentieth
and
not
the
nineteenth
century
,
and
love
was
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
now
quicker
in
growth
,
as
well
as
franker
in
utterance
than
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
Mrs.
Leete
I
went
to
Edith
.
When
I
found
her
,
it
was
first
of
all
*NL*
to
take
her
by
both
hands
and
stand
a
long
time
in
rapt
contemplation
*NL*
of
her
face
.
As
I
gazed
,
the
memory
of
that
other
Edith
,
which
had
*NL*
been
affected
as
with
a
benumbing
shock
by
the
tremendous
experience
*NL*
that
had
parted
us
,
revived
,
and
my
heart
was
dissolved
with
tender
*NL*
and
pitiful
emotions
,
but
also
very
blissful
ones
.
For
she
who
brought
*NL*
to
me
so
poignantly
the
sense
of
my
loss
was
to
make
that
loss
good
.
*NL*
It
was
as
if
from
her
eyes
Edith
Bartlett
looked
into
mine
,
and
smiled
*NL*
consolation
to
me
.
My
fate
was
not
alone
the
strangest
,
but
the
most
*NL*
fortunate
that
ever
befell
a
man
.
A
double
miracle
had
been
wrought
*NL*
for
me
.
I
had
not
been
stranded
upon
the
shore
of
this
strange
world
*NL*
to
find
myself
alone
and
companionless
.
My
love
,
whom
I
had
dreamed
*NL*
lost
,
had
been
reembodied
for
my
consolation
.
When
at
last
,
in
an
*NL*
ecstasy
of
gratitude
and
tenderness
,
I
folded
the
lovely
girl
in
my
*NL*
arms
,
the
two
Ediths
were
blended
in
my
thought
,
nor
have
they
ever
*NL*
since
been
clearly
distinguished
.
I
was
not
long
in
finding
that
on
*NL*
Edith
's
part
there
was
a
corresponding
confusion
of
identities
.
Never
,
*NL*
surely
,
was
there
between
freshly
united
lovers
a
stranger
talk
than
*NL*
ours
that
afternoon
.
She
seemed
more
anxious
to
have
me
speak
of
Edith
*NL*
Bartlett
than
of
herself
,
of
how
I
had
loved
her
than
how
I
loved
*NL*
herself
,
rewarding
my
fond
words
concerning
another
woman
with
tears
*NL*
and
tender
smiles
and
pressures
of
the
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
not
love
me
too
much
for
myself
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
shall
be
very
*NL*
jealous
for
her
.
I
shall
not
let
you
forget
her
.
I
am
going
to
tell
*NL*
you
something
which
you
may
think
strange
.
Do
you
not
believe
that
*NL*
spirits
sometimes
come
back
to
the
world
to
fulfill
some
work
that
lay
*NL*
near
their
hearts
?
What
if
I
were
to
tell
you
that
I
have
sometimes
*NL*
thought
that
her
spirit
lives
in
me
,
--
that
Edith
Bartlett
,
not
Edith
*NL*
Leete
,
is
my
real
name
.
I
can
not
know
it
;
of
course
none
of
us
can
*NL*
know
who
we
really
are
;
but
I
can
feel
it
.
Can
you
wonder
that
I
have
*NL*
such
a
feeling
,
seeing
how
my
life
was
affected
by
her
and
by
you
,
*NL*
even
before
you
came
.
So
you
see
you
need
not
trouble
to
love
me
at
*NL*
all
,
if
only
you
are
true
to
her
.
I
shall
not
be
likely
to
be
*NL*
jealous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Leete
had
gone
out
that
afternoon
,
and
I
did
not
have
an
interview
*NL*
with
him
till
later
.
He
was
not
,
apparently
,
wholly
unprepared
for
the
*NL*
intelligence
I
conveyed
,
and
shook
my
hand
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
any
ordinary
circumstances
,
Mr.
West
,
I
should
say
that
this
*NL*
step
had
been
taken
on
rather
short
acquaintance
;
but
these
are
*NL*
decidedly
not
ordinary
circumstances
.
In
fairness
,
perhaps
I
ought
to
*NL*
tell
you
,
''
he
added
,
smilingly
,
``
that
while
I
cheerfully
consent
to
*NL*
the
proposed
arrangement
,
you
must
not
feel
too
much
indebted
to
me
,
*NL*
as
I
judge
my
consent
is
a
mere
formality
.
From
the
moment
the
secret
*NL*
of
the
locket
was
out
,
it
had
to
be
,
I
fancy
.
Why
,
bless
me
,
if
Edith
*NL*
had
not
been
there
to
redeem
her
great-grandmother
's
pledge
,
I
really
*NL*
apprehend
that
Mrs.
Leete
's
loyalty
to
me
would
have
suffered
a
severe
*NL*
strain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
the
garden
was
bathed
in
moonlight
,
and
till
midnight
*NL*
Edith
and
I
wandered
to
and
fro
there
,
trying
to
grow
accustomed
to
*NL*
our
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
should
I
have
done
if
you
had
not
cared
for
me
?
''
she
exclaimed
.
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
you
were
not
going
to
.
What
should
I
have
done
then
,
*NL*
when
I
felt
I
was
consecrated
to
you
!
As
soon
as
you
came
back
to
*NL*
life
,
I
was
as
sure
as
if
she
had
told
me
that
I
was
to
be
to
you
what
*NL*
she
could
not
be
,
but
that
could
only
be
if
you
would
let
me
.
Oh
,
how
*NL*
I
wanted
to
tell
you
that
morning
,
when
you
felt
so
terribly
strange
*NL*
among
us
,
who
I
was
,
but
dared
not
open
my
lips
about
that
,
or
let
*NL*
father
or
mother
''
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
have
been
what
you
would
not
let
your
father
tell
me
!
''
I
*NL*
exclaimed
,
referring
to
the
conversation
I
had
overheard
as
I
came
out
*NL*
of
my
trance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
was
,
''
Edith
laughed
.
``
Did
you
only
just
guess
that
?
*NL*
Father
being
only
a
man
,
thought
that
it
would
make
you
feel
among
*NL*
friends
to
tell
you
who
we
were
.
He
did
not
think
of
me
at
all
.
But
*NL*
mother
knew
what
I
meant
,
and
so
I
had
my
way
.
I
could
never
have
*NL*
looked
you
in
the
face
if
you
had
known
who
I
was
.
It
would
have
been
*NL*
forcing
myself
on
you
quite
too
boldly
.
I
am
afraid
you
think
I
did
*NL*
that
to-day
,
as
it
was
.
I
am
sure
I
did
not
mean
to
,
for
I
know
girls
*NL*
were
expected
to
hide
their
feelings
in
your
day
,
and
I
was
dreadfully
*NL*
afraid
of
shocking
you
.
Ah
me
,
how
hard
it
must
have
been
for
them
to
*NL*
have
always
had
to
conceal
their
love
like
a
fault
.
Why
did
they
think
*NL*
it
such
a
shame
to
love
any
one
till
they
had
been
given
permission
?
*NL*
It
is
so
odd
to
think
of
waiting
for
permission
to
fall
in
love
.
Was
*NL*
it
because
men
in
those
days
were
angry
when
girls
loved
them
?
That
is
*NL*
not
the
way
women
would
feel
,
I
am
sure
,
or
men
either
,
I
think
,
now
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
understand
it
at
all
.
That
will
be
one
of
the
curious
things
*NL*
about
the
women
of
those
days
that
you
will
have
to
explain
to
me
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
Edith
Bartlett
was
so
foolish
as
the
others
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
sundry
ineffectual
attempts
at
parting
,
she
finally
insisted
*NL*
that
we
must
say
good
night
.
I
was
about
to
imprint
upon
her
lips
the
*NL*
positively
last
kiss
,
when
she
said
,
with
an
indescribable
archness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
troubles
me
.
Are
you
sure
that
you
quite
forgive
Edith
*NL*
Bartlett
for
marrying
any
one
else
?
The
books
that
have
come
down
to
*NL*
us
make
out
lovers
of
your
time
more
jealous
than
fond
,
and
that
is
*NL*
what
makes
me
ask
.
It
would
be
a
great
relief
to
me
if
I
could
feel
*NL*
sure
that
you
were
not
in
the
least
jealous
of
my
great-grandfather
*NL*
for
marrying
your
sweetheart
.
May
I
tell
my
great-grandmother
's
*NL*
picture
when
I
go
to
my
room
that
you
quite
forgive
her
for
proving
*NL*
false
to
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Will
the
reader
believe
it
,
this
coquettish
quip
,
whether
the
speaker
*NL*
herself
had
any
idea
of
it
or
not
,
actually
touched
and
with
the
*NL*
touching
cured
a
preposterous
ache
of
something
like
jealousy
which
I
*NL*
had
been
vaguely
conscious
of
ever
since
Mrs.
Leete
had
told
me
of
*NL*
Edith
Bartlett
's
marriage
.
Even
while
I
had
been
holding
Edith
*NL*
Bartlett
's
great-granddaughter
in
my
arms
,
I
had
not
,
till
this
*NL*
moment
,
so
illogical
are
some
of
our
feelings
,
distinctly
realized
*NL*
that
but
for
that
marriage
I
could
not
have
done
so
.
The
absurdity
of
*NL*
this
frame
of
mind
could
only
be
equalled
by
the
abruptness
with
which
*NL*
it
dissolved
as
Edith
's
roguish
query
cleared
the
fog
from
my
*NL*
perceptions
.
I
laughed
as
I
kissed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
assure
her
of
my
entire
forgiveness
,
''
I
said
,
``
although
if
it
*NL*
had
been
any
man
but
your
great-grandfather
whom
she
married
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
a
very
different
matter
.

*NL*
On
reaching
my
chamber
that
night
I
did
not
open
the
musical
telephone
*NL*
that
I
might
be
lulled
to
sleep
with
soothing
tunes
,
as
had
become
my
*NL*
habit
.
For
once
my
thoughts
made
better
music
than
even
twentieth
*NL*
century
orchestras
discourse
,
and
it
held
me
enchanted
till
well
*NL*
toward
morning
,
when
I
fell
asleep

``
It
's
a
little
after
the
time
you
told
me
to
wake

*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
was
the
voice
of
my
man
Sawyer
.
I
started
bolt
upright
in
*NL*
bed
and
stared
around
.
I
was
in
my
underground
chamber
.
The
mellow
*NL*
light
of
the
lamp
which
always
burned
in
the
room
when
I
occupied
it
*NL*
illumined
the
familiar
walls
and
furnishings
.
By
my
bedside
,
with
the
*NL*
glass
of
sherry
in
his
hand
which
Dr.
Pillsbury
prescribed
on
first

rousing
from
a
mesmeric
sleep

way
of
awakening
the
torpid
physical

Sawyer
.

*NL*
``
Better
take

right
off

said
,
as
I
stared
blankly
at
*NL*
him
.
``
You
look
kind
of
flushed
like
,
sir
,
and
you
need
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
I
tossed
off
the
liquor
and
began
to
realize
what
had
happened
to
me
.
*NL*
It
was
,
of
course
,
very
plain
.
All
that
about
the
twentieth
century
*NL*
had
been
a
dream
.
I
had
but
dreamed
of
that
enlightened
and
care-free
*NL*
race
of
men
and
their
ingeniously
simple
institutions
,
of
the
glorious
*NL*
new
Boston
with
its
domes
and
pinnacles
,
its
gardens
and
fountains
,
*NL*
and
its
universal
reign
of
comfort
.
The
amiable
family
which
I
had
*NL*
learned
to
know
so
well
,
my
genial
host
and
Mentor
,
Dr.
Leete
,
his
*NL*
wife
,
and
their
daughter
,
the
second
and
more
beauteous
Edith
,
my
*NL*
betrothed
,
--
these
,
too
,
had
been
but
figments
of
a
vision
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
considerable
time
I
remained
in
the
attitude
in
which
this
*NL*
conviction
had
come
over
me
,
sitting
up
in
bed
gazing
at
vacancy
,
*NL*
absorbed
in
recalling
the
scenes
and
incidents
of
my
fantastic
*NL*
experience
.
Sawyer
,
alarmed
at
my
looks
,
was
meanwhile
anxiously
*NL*
inquiring
what
was
the
matter
with
me
.
Roused
at
length
by
his
*NL*
importunities
to
a
recognition
of
my
surroundings
,
I
pulled
myself
*NL*
together
with
an
effort
and
assured
the
faithful
fellow
that
I
was
all
*NL*
right
.
``
I
have
had
an
extraordinary
dream
,
that
's
all
,
Sawyer
,
''
I
*NL*
said
,
``
a
most-ex-traor-dinary-dream
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
dressed
in
a
mechanical
way
,
feeling
lightheaded
and
oddly
uncertain
*NL*
of
myself
,
and
sat
down
to
the
coffee
and
rolls
which
Sawyer
was
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
providing
for
my
refreshment
before
I
left
the
house
.
The
*NL*
morning
newspaper
lay
by
the
plate
.
I
took
it
up
,
and
my
eye
fell
on
*NL*
the
date
,
May
31
,
1887
.
I
had
known
,
of
course
,
from
the
moment
I
*NL*
opened
my
eyes
that
my
long
and
detailed
experience
in
another
century
*NL*
had
been
a
dream
,
and
yet
it
was
startling
to
have
it
so
conclusively
*NL*
demonstrated
that
the
world
was
but
a
few
hours
older
than
when
I
had
*NL*
lain
down
to
sleep
.

Glancing

''

*
*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
indeed
the
nineteenth
century
to
which
I
had
awaked
;
there
*NL*
could
be
no
kind
of
doubt
about
that
.
Its
complete
microcosm
this
*NL*
summary
of
the
day
's
news
had
presented
,
even
to
that
last
*NL*
unmistakable
touch
of
fatuous
self-complacency
.
Coming
after
such
a
*NL*
damning
indictment
of
the
age
as
that
one
day
's
chronicle
of
*NL*
world-wide
bloodshed
,
greed
,
and
tyranny
,
was
a
bit
of
cynicism
worthy
*NL*
of
Mephistopheles
,
and
yet
of
all
whose
eyes
it
had
met
this
morning
I
*NL*
was
,
perhaps
,
the
only
one
who
perceived
the
cynicism
,
and
but
*NL*
yesterday
I
should
have
perceived
it
no
more
than
the
others
.
That
*NL*
strange
dream
it
was
which
had
made
all
the
difference
.
For
I
know
not
*NL*
how
long
,
I
forgot
my
surroundings
after
this
,
and
was
again
in
fancy
*NL*
moving
in
that
vivid
dream-world
,
in
that
glorious
city
,
with
its
*NL*
homes
of
simple
comfort
and
its
gorgeous
public
palaces
.
Around
me
*NL*
were
again
faces
unmarred
by
arrogance
or
servility
,
by
envy
or
greed
,
*NL*
by
anxious
care
or
feverish
ambition
,
and
stately
forms
of
men
and
*NL*
women
who
had
never
known
fear
of
a
fellow
man
or
depended
on
his
*NL*
favor
,
but
always
,
in
the
words
of
that
sermon
which
still
rang
in
my
*NL*
ears
,
had
``
stood
up
straight
before
God
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
profound
sigh
and
a
sense
of
irreparable
loss
,
not
the
less
*NL*
poignant
that
it
was
a
loss
of
what
had
never
really
been
,
I
roused
at
*NL*
last
from
my
reverie
,
and
soon
after
left
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
dozen
times
between
my
door
and
Washington
Street
I
had
to
stop
and
*NL*
pull
myself
together
,
such
power
had
been
in
that
vision
of
the
Boston
*NL*
of
the
future
to
make
the
real
Boston
strange
.
The
squalor
and
*NL*
malodorousness
of
the
town
struck
me
,
from
the
moment
I
stood
upon
the
*NL*
street
,
as
facts
I
had
never
before
observed
.
But
yesterday
,
moreover
,
*NL*
it
had
seemed
quite
a
matter
of
course
that
some
of
my
fellow-citizens
*NL*
should
wear
silks
,
and
others
rags
,
that
some
should
look
well
fed
,
*NL*
and
others
hungry
.
Now
on
the
contrary
the
glaring
disparities
in
the
*NL*
dress
and
condition
of
the
men
and
women
who
brushed
each
other
on
the
*NL*
sidewalks
shocked
me
at
every
step
,
and
yet
more
the
entire
*NL*
indifference
which
the
prosperous
showed
to
the
plight
of
the
*NL*
unfortunate
.
Were
these
human
beings
,
who
could
behold
the
*NL*
wretchedness
of
their
fellows
without
so
much
as
a
change
of
*NL*
countenance
?
And
yet
,
all
the
while
,
I
knew
well
that
it
was
I
who
had
*NL*
changed
,
and
not
my
contemporaries
.
I
had
dreamed
of
a
city
whose
*NL*
people
fared
all
alike
as
children
of
one
family
and
were
one
*NL*
another
's
keepers
in
all
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
feature
of
the
real
Boston
,
which
assumed
the
extraordinary
*NL*
effect
of
strangeness
that
marks
familiar
things
seen
in
a
new
light
,
*NL*
was
the
prevalence
of
advertising
.
There
had
been
no
personal
*NL*
advertising
in
the
Boston
of
the
twentieth
century
,
because
there
was
*NL*
no
need
of
any
,
but
here
the
walls
of
the
buildings
,
the
windows
,
the
*NL*
broadsides
of
the
newspapers
in
every
hand
,
the
very
pavements
,
*NL*
everything
in
fact
in
sight
,
save
the
sky
,
were
covered
with
the
*NL*
appeals
of
individuals
who
sought
,
under
innumerable
pretexts
,
to
*NL*
attract
the
contributions
of
others
to
their
support
.
However
the
*NL*
wording
might
vary
,
the
tenor
of
all
these
appeals
was
the
same
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Help
John
Jones
.
Never
mind
the
rest
.
They
are
frauds
.
I
,
John
Jones
,
*NL*
am
the
right
one
.
Buy
of
me
.
Employ
me
.
Visit
me
.
Hear
me
,
John
Jones
.
*NL*
Look
at
me
.
Make
no
mistake
,
John
Jones
is
the
man
and
nobody
else
.
*NL*
Let
the
rest
starve
,
but
for
God
's
sake
remember
John
Jones
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
the
pathos
or
the
moral
repulsiveness
of
the
spectacle
most
*NL*
impressed
me
,
so
suddenly
become
a
stranger
in
my
own
city
,
I
know
*NL*
not
.
Wretched
men
,
I
was
moved
to
cry
,
who
,
because
they
will
not
*NL*
learn
to
be
helpers
of
one
another
,
are
doomed
to
be
beggars
of
one
*NL*
another
from
the
least
to
the
greatest
!
This
horrible
babel
of
*NL*
shameless
self-assertion
and
mutual
depreciation
,
this
stunning
clamor
*NL*
of
conflicting
boasts
,
appeals
,
and
adjurations
,
this
stupendous
*NL*
system
of
brazen
beggary
,
what
was
it
all
but
the
necessity
of
a
*NL*
society
in
which
the
opportunity
to
serve
the
world
according
to
his
*NL*
gifts
,
instead
of
being
secured
to
every
man
as
the
first
object
of
*NL*
social
organization
,
had
to
be
fought
for
!
*NL*
*NL*
I
reached
Washington
Street
at
the
busiest
point
,
and
there
I
stood
*NL*
and
laughed
aloud
,
to
the
scandal
of
the
passers-by
.
For
my
life
I
*NL*
could
not
have
helped
it
,
with
such
a
mad
humor
was
I
moved
at
sight
*NL*
of
the
interminable
rows
of
stores
on
either
side
,
up
and
down
the
*NL*
street
so
far
as
I
could
see
,
--
scores
of
them
,
to
make
the
spectacle
*NL*
more
utterly
preposterous
,
within
a
stone
's
throw
devoted
to
selling
*NL*
the
same
sort
of
goods
.
Stores
!
stores
!
stores
!
miles
of
stores
!
ten
*NL*
thousand
stores
to
distribute
the
goods
needed
by
this
one
city
,
which
*NL*
in
my
dream
had
been
supplied
with
all
things
from
a
single
warehouse
,
*NL*
as
they
were
ordered
through
one
great
store
in
every
quarter
,
where
*NL*
the
buyer
,
without
waste
of
time
or
labor
,
found
under
one
roof
the
*NL*
world
's
assortment
in
whatever
line
he
desired
.
There
the
labor
of
*NL*
distribution
had
been
so
slight
as
to
add
but
a
scarcely
perceptible
*NL*
fraction
to
the
cost
of
commodities
to
the
user
.
The
cost
of
*NL*
production
was
virtually
all
he
paid
.
But
here
the
mere
distribution
*NL*
of
the
goods
,
their
handling
alone
,
added
a
fourth
,
a
third
,
a
half
*NL*
and
more
,
to
the
cost
.
All
these
ten
thousand
plants
must
be
paid
for
,
*NL*
their
rent
,
their
staffs
of
superintendence
,
their
platoons
of
*NL*
salesmen
,
their
ten
thousand
sets
of
accountants
,
jobbers
,
and
*NL*
business
dependents
,
with
all
they
spent
in
advertising
themselves
and
*NL*
fighting
one
another
,
and
the
consumers
must
do
the
paying
.
What
a
*NL*
famous
process
for
beggaring
a
nation
!
*NL*
*NL*
Were
these
serious
men
I
saw
about
me
,
or
children
,
who
did
their
*NL*
business
on
such
a
plan
?
Could
they
be
reasoning
beings
,
who
did
not
*NL*
see
the
folly
which
,
when
the
product
is
made
and
ready
for
use
,
*NL*
wastes
so
much
of
it
in
getting
it
to
the
user
?
If
people
eat
with
a
*NL*
spoon
that
leaks
half
its
contents
between
bowl
and
lip
,
are
they
not
*NL*
likely
to
go
hungry
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
had
passed
through
Washington
Street
thousands
of
times
before
and
*NL*
viewed
the
ways
of
those
who
sold
merchandise
,
but
my
curiosity
*NL*
concerning
them
was
as
if
I
had
never
gone
by
their
way
before
.
I
took
*NL*
wondering
note
of
the
show
windows
of
the
stores
,
filled
with
goods
*NL*
arranged
with
a
wealth
of
pains
and
artistic
device
to
attract
the
*NL*
eye
.
I
saw
the
throngs
of
ladies
looking
in
,
and
the
proprietors
*NL*
eagerly
watching
the
effect
of
the
bait
.
I
went
within
and
noted
the
*NL*
hawk-eyed
floor-walker
watching
for
business
,
overlooking
the
clerks
,
*NL*
keeping
them
up
to
their
task
of
inducing
the
customers
to
buy
,
buy
,
*NL*
buy
,
for
money
if
they
had
it
,
for
credit
if
they
had
it
not
,
to
buy
*NL*
what
they
wanted
not
,
more
than
they
wanted
,
what
they
could
not
*NL*
afford
.
At
times
I
momentarily
lost
the
clue
and
was
confused
by
the
*NL*
sight
.
Why
this
effort
to
induce
people
to
buy
?
Surely
that
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
the
legitimate
business
of
distributing
products
to
*NL*
those
who
needed
them
.
Surely
it
was
the
sheerest
waste
to
force
upon
*NL*
people
what
they
did
not
want
,
but
what
might
be
useful
to
another
.
*NL*
The
nation
was
so
much
the
poorer
for
every
such
achievement
.
What
*NL*
were
these
clerks
thinking
of
?
Then
I
would
remember
that
they
were
*NL*
not
acting
as
distributors
like
those
in
the
store
I
had
visited
in
*NL*
the
dream
Boston
.
They
were
not
serving
the
public
interest
,
but
their
*NL*
immediate
personal
interest
,
and
it
was
nothing
to
them
what
the
*NL*
ultimate
effect
of
their
course
on
the
general
prosperity
might
be
,
if
*NL*
but
they
increased
their
own
hoard
,
for
these
goods
were
their
own
,
*NL*
and
the
more
they
sold
and
the
more
they
got
for
them
,
the
greater
*NL*
their
gain
.
The
more
wasteful
the
people
were
,
the
more
articles
they
*NL*
did
not
want
which
they
could
be
induced
to
buy
,
the
better
for
these
*NL*
sellers
.
To
encourage
prodigality
was
the
express
aim
of
the
ten
*NL*
thousand
stores
of
Boston
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
were
these
storekeepers
and
clerks
a
whit
worse
men
than
any
*NL*
others
in
Boston
.
They
must
earn
a
living
and
support
their
families
,
*NL*
and
how
were
they
to
find
a
trade
to
do
it
by
which
did
not
*NL*
necessitate
placing
their
individual
interests
before
those
of
others
*NL*
and
that
of
all
?
They
could
not
be
asked
to
starve
while
they
waited
*NL*
for
an
order
of
things
such
as
I
had
seen
in
my
dream
,
in
which
the
*NL*
interest
of
each
and
that
of
all
were
identical
.
But
,
God
in
heaven
!
*NL*
what
wonder
,
under
such
a
system
as
this
about
me
--
what
wonder
that
*NL*
the
city
was
so
shabby
,
and
the
people
so
meanly
dressed
,
and
so
many
*NL*
of
them
ragged
and
hungry
!
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
it
was
that
I
drifted
over
into
South
Boston
and
*NL*
found
myself
among
the
manufacturing
establishments
.
I
had
been
in
*NL*
this
quarter
of
the
city
a
hundred
times
before
,
just
as
I
had
been
on
*NL*
Washington
Street
,
but
here
,
as
well
as
there
,
I
now
first
perceived
*NL*
the
true
significance
of
what
I
witnessed
.
Formerly
I
had
taken
pride
*NL*
in
the
fact
that
,
by
actual
count
,
Boston
had
some
four
thousand
*NL*
independent
manufacturing
establishments
;
but
in
this
very
*NL*
multiplicity
and
independence
I
recognized
now
the
secret
of
the
*NL*
insignificant
total
product
of
their
industry
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Washington
Street
had
been
like
a
lane
in
Bedlam
,
this
was
a
*NL*
spectacle
as
much
more
melancholy
as
production
is
a
more
vital
*NL*
function
,
than
distribution
.
For
not
only
were
these
four
thousand
*NL*
establishments
not
working
in
concert
,
and
for
that
reason
alone
*NL*
operating
at
prodigious
disadvantage
,
but
,
as
if
this
did
not
involve
*NL*
a
sufficiently
disastrous
loss
of
power
,
they
were
using
their
utmost
*NL*
skill
to
frustrate
one
another
's
effort
,
praying
by
night
and
working
*NL*
by
day
for
the
destruction
of
one
another
's
enterprises
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
roar
and
rattle
of
wheels
and
hammers
resounding
from
every
side
*NL*
was
not
the
hum
of
a
peaceful
industry
,
but
the
clangor
of
swords
*NL*
wielded
by
foemen
.
These
mills
and
shops
were
so
many
forts
,
each
*NL*
under
its
own
flag
,
its
guns
trained
on
the
mills
and
shops
about
it
,
*NL*
and
its
sappers
busy
below
,
undermining
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
each
one
of
these
forts
the
strictest
organization
of
industry
*NL*
was
insisted
on
;
the
separate
gangs
worked
under
a
single
central
*NL*
authority
.
No
interference
and
no
duplicating
of
work
were
permitted
.
*NL*
Each
had
his
allotted
task
,
and
none
were
idle
.
By
what
hiatus
in
the
*NL*
logical
faculty
,
by
what
lost
link
of
reasoning
,
account
,
then
,
for
*NL*
the
failure
to
recognize
the
necessity
of
applying
the
same
principle
*NL*
to
the
organization
of
the
national
industries
as
a
whole
,
to
see
that
*NL*
if
lack
of
organization
could
impair
the
efficiency
of
a
shop
,
it
must
*NL*
have
effects
as
much
more
disastrous
in
disabling
the
industries
of
*NL*
the
nation
at
large
as
the
latter
are
vaster
in
volume
and
more
*NL*
complex
in
the
relationship
of
their
parts
.
*NL*
*NL*
People
would
be
prompt
enough
to
ridicule
an
army
in
which
there
were
*NL*
neither
companies
,
battalions
,
regiments
,
brigades
,
divisions
,
or
army
*NL*
corps
,
--
no
unit
of
organization
,
in
fact
,
larger
than
the
corporal
's
*NL*
squad
,
with
no
officer
higher
than
a
corporal
,
and
all
the
corporals
*NL*
equal
in
authority
.
And
yet
just
such
an
army
were
the
manufacturing
*NL*
industries
of
nineteenth
century
Boston
,
an
army
of
four
thousand
*NL*
independent
squads
led
by
four
thousand
independent
corporals
,
each
*NL*
with
a
separate
plan
of
campaign
.
*NL*
*NL*
Knots
of
idle
men
were
to
be
seen
here
and
there
on
every
side
,
some
*NL*
idle
because
they
could
find
no
work
at
any
price
,
others
because
they
*NL*
could
not
get
what
they
thought
a
fair
price
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
accosted
some
of
the
latter
,
and
they
told
me
their
grievances
.
It
*NL*
was
very
little
comfort
I
could
give
them
.
``
I
am
sorry
for
you
,
''
I
*NL*
said
.
``
You
get
little
enough
,
certainly
,
and
yet
the
wonder
to
me
is
,
*NL*
not
that
industries
conducted
as
these
are
do
not
pay
you
living
*NL*
wages
,
but
that
they
are
able
to
pay
you
any
wages
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Making
my
way
back
again
after
this
to
the
peninsular
city
,
toward
*NL*
three
o'clock
I
stood
on
State
Street
,
staring
,
as
if
I
had
never
seen
*NL*
them
before
,
at
the
banks
and
brokers
'
offices
,
and
other
financial
*NL*
institutions
,
of
which
there
had
been
in
the
State
Street
of
my
vision
*NL*
no
vestige
.
Business
men
,
confidential
clerks
,
and
errand
boys
were
*NL*
thronging
in
and
out
of
the
banks
,
for
it
wanted
but
a
few
minutes
of
*NL*
the
closing
hour
.
Opposite
me
was
the
bank
where
I
did
business
,
and
*NL*
presently
I
crossed
the
street
,
and
,
going
in
with
the
crowd
,
stood
in
*NL*
a
recess
of
the
wall
looking
on
at
the
army
of
clerks
handling
money
,
*NL*
and
the
cues
of
depositors
at
the
tellers
'
windows
.
An
old
gentleman
*NL*
whom
I
knew
,
a
director
of
the
bank
,
passing
me
and
observing
my
*NL*
contemplative
attitude
,
stopped
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Interesting
sight
,
is
n't
it
,
Mr.
West
,
''
he
said
.
``
Wonderful
piece
of
*NL*
mechanism
;
I
find
it
so
myself
.
I
like
sometimes
to
stand
and
look
on
*NL*
at
it
just
as
you
are
doing
.
It
's
a
poem
,
sir
,
a
poem
,
that
's
what
I
*NL*
call
it
.
Did
you
ever
think
,
Mr.
West
,
that
the
bank
is
the
heart
of
*NL*
the
business
system
?
From
it
and
to
it
,
in
endless
flux
and
reflux
,
*NL*
the
life
blood
goes
.
It
is
flowing
in
now
.
It
will
flow
out
again
in
*NL*
the
morning
;
''
and
pleased
with
his
little
conceit
,
the
old
man
passed
*NL*
on
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
I
should
have
considered
the
simile
apt
enough
,
but
since
*NL*
then
I
had
visited
a
world
incomparably
more
affluent
than
this
,
in
*NL*
which
money
was
unknown
and
without
conceivable
use
.
I
had
learned
*NL*
that
it
had
a
use
in
the
world
around
me
only
because
the
work
of
*NL*
producing
the
nation
's
livelihood
,
instead
of
being
regarded
as
the
*NL*
most
strictly
public
and
common
of
all
concerns
,
and
as
such
conducted
*NL*
by
the
nation
,
was
abandoned
to
the
hap-hazard
efforts
of
individuals
.
*NL*
This
original
mistake
necessitated
endless
exchanges
to
bring
about
*NL*
any
sort
of
general
distribution
of
products
.
These
exchanges
money
*NL*
effected
--
how
equitably
,
might
be
seen
in
a
walk
from
the
tenement
*NL*
house
districts
to
the
Back
Bay
--
at
the
cost
of
an
army
of
men
taken
*NL*
from
productive
labor
to
manage
it
,
with
constant
ruinous
breakdowns
*NL*
of
its
machinery
,
and
a
generally
debauching
influence
on
mankind
*NL*
which
had
justified
its
description
,
from
ancient
time
,
as
the
``
root
*NL*
of
all
evil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
for
the
poor
old
bank
director
with
his
poem
!
He
had
mistaken
the
*NL*
throbbing
of
an
abscess
for
the
beating
of
the
heart
.
What
he
called
*NL*
``
a
wonderful
piece
of
mechanism
''
was
an
imperfect
device
to
remedy
an
*NL*
unnecessary
defect
,
the
clumsy
crutch
of
a
self-made
cripple
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
banks
had
closed
I
wandered
aimlessly
about
the
business
*NL*
quarter
for
an
hour
or
two
,
and
later
sat
a
while
on
one
of
the
*NL*
benches
of
the
Common
,
finding
an
interest
merely
in
watching
the
*NL*
throngs
that
passed
,
such
as
one
has
in
studying
the
populace
of
a
*NL*
foreign
city
,
so
strange
since
yesterday
had
my
fellow
citizens
and
*NL*
their
ways
become
to
me
.
For
thirty
years
I
had
lived
among
them
,
and
*NL*
yet
I
seemed
to
have
never
noted
before
how
drawn
and
anxious
were
*NL*
their
faces
,
of
the
rich
as
of
the
poor
,
the
refined
,
acute
faces
of
*NL*
the
educated
as
well
as
the
dull
masks
of
the
ignorant
.
And
well
it
*NL*
might
be
so
,
for
I
saw
now
,
as
never
before
I
had
seen
so
plainly
,
*NL*
that
each
as
he
walked
constantly
turned
to
catch
the
whispers
of
a
*NL*
spectre
at
his
ear
,
the
spectre
of
Uncertainty
.
``
Do
your
work
never
so
*NL*
well
,
''
the
spectre
was
whispering
,
--
``
rise
early
and
toil
till
late
,
*NL*
rob
cunningly
or
serve
faithfully
,
you
shall
never
know
security
.
Rich
*NL*
you
may
be
now
and
still
come
to
poverty
at
last
.
Leave
never
so
much
*NL*
wealth
to
your
children
,
you
can
not
buy
the
assurance
that
your
son
*NL*
may
not
be
the
servant
of
your
servant
,
or
that
your
daughter
will
not
*NL*
have
to
sell
herself
for
bread
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
passing
by
thrust
an
advertising
card
in
my
hand
,
which
set
*NL*
forth
the
merits
of
some
new
scheme
of
life
insurance
.
The
incident
*NL*
reminded
me
of
the
only
device
,
pathetic
in
its
admission
of
the
*NL*
universal
need
it
so
poorly
supplied
,
which
offered
these
tired
and
*NL*
hunted
men
and
women
even
a
partial
protection
from
uncertainty
.
By
*NL*
this
means
,
those
already
well-to-do
,
I
remembered
,
might
purchase
a
*NL*
precarious
confidence
that
after
their
death
their
loved
ones
would
*NL*
not
,
for
a
while
at
least
,
be
trampled
under
the
feet
of
men
.
But
this
*NL*
was
all
,
and
this
was
only
for
those
who
could
pay
well
for
it
.
What
*NL*
idea
was
possible
to
these
wretched
dwellers
in
the
land
of
Ishmael
,
*NL*
where
every
man
's
hand
was
against
each
and
the
hand
of
each
against
*NL*
every
other
,
of
true
life
insurance
as
I
had
seen
it
among
the
people
*NL*
of
that
dream
land
,
each
of
whom
,
by
virtue
merely
of
his
membership
*NL*
in
the
national
family
,
was
guaranteed
against
need
of
any
sort
,
by
a
*NL*
policy
underwritten
by
one
hundred
million
fellow
countrymen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
time
after
this
it
was
that
I
recall
a
glimpse
of
myself
standing
*NL*
on
the
steps
of
a
building
on
Tremont
Street
,
looking
at
a
military
*NL*
parade
.
A
regiment
was
passing
.
It
was
the
first
sight
in
that
dreary
*NL*
day
which
had
inspired
me
with
any
other
emotions
than
wondering
pity
*NL*
and
amazement
.
Here
at
last
were
order
and
reason
,
an
exhibition
of
*NL*
what
intelligent
cooperation
can
accomplish
.
The
people
who
stood
*NL*
looking
on
with
kindling
faces
,
--
could
it
be
that
the
sight
had
for
*NL*
them
no
more
than
but
a
spectacular
interest
?
Could
they
fail
to
see
*NL*
that
it
was
their
perfect
concert
of
action
,
their
organization
under
*NL*
one
control
,
which
made
these
men
the
tremendous
engine
they
were
,
*NL*
able
to
vanquish
a
mob
ten
times
as
numerous
?
Seeing
this
so
plainly
,
*NL*
could
they
fail
to
compare
the
scientific
manner
in
which
the
nation
*NL*
went
to
war
with
the
unscientific
manner
in
which
it
went
to
work
?
*NL*
Would
they
not
query
since
what
time
the
killing
of
men
had
been
a
*NL*
task
so
much
more
important
than
feeding
and
clothing
them
,
that
a
*NL*
trained
army
should
be
deemed
alone
adequate
to
the
former
,
while
the
*NL*
latter
was
left
to
a
mob
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
toward
nightfall
,
and
the
streets
were
thronged
with
the
*NL*
workers
from
the
stores
,
the
shops
,
and
mills
.
Carried
along
with
the
*NL*
stronger
part
of
the
current
,
I
found
myself
,
as
it
began
to
grow
*NL*
dark
,
in
the
midst
of
a
scene
of
squalor
and
human
degradation
such
as
*NL*
only
the
South
Cove
tenement
district
could
present
.
I
had
seen
the
*NL*
mad
wasting
of
human
labor
;
here
I
saw
in
direst
shape
the
want
that
*NL*
waste
had
bred
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
black
doorways
and
windows
of
the
rookeries
on
every
side
*NL*
came
gusts
of
fetid
air
.
The
streets
and
alleys
reeked
with
the
*NL*
effluvia
of
a
slave
ship
's
between-decks
.
As
I
passed
I
had
glimpses
*NL*
within
of
pale
babies
gasping
out
their
lives
amid
sultry
stenches
,
of
*NL*
hopeless-faced
women
deformed
by
hardship
,
retaining
of
womanhood
no
*NL*
trait
save
weakness
,
while
from
the
windows
leered
girls
with
brows
of
*NL*
brass
.
Like
the
starving
bands
of
mongrel
curs
that
infest
the
streets
*NL*
of
Moslem
towns
,
swarms
of
half-clad
brutalized
children
filled
the
*NL*
air
with
shrieks
and
curses
as
they
fought
and
tumbled
among
the
*NL*
garbage
that
littered
the
court-yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
in
all
this
that
was
new
to
me
.
Often
had
I
passed
*NL*
through
this
part
of
the
city
and
witnessed
its
sights
with
feelings
*NL*
of
disgust
mingled
with
a
certain
philosophical
wonder
at
the
*NL*
extremities
mortals
will
endure
and
still
cling
to
life
.
But
not
alone
*NL*
as
regarded
the
economical
follies
of
this
age
,
but
equally
as
touched
*NL*
its
moral
abominations
,
scales
had
fallen
from
my
eyes
since
that
*NL*
vision
of
another
century
.
No
more
did
I
look
upon
the
woful
dwellers
*NL*
in
this
Inferno
with
a
callous
curiosity
as
creatures
scarcely
human
.
*NL*
I
saw
in
them
my
brothers
and
sisters
,
my
parents
,
my
children
,
flesh
*NL*
of
my
flesh
,
blood
of
my
blood
.
The
festering
mass
of
human
*NL*
wretchedness
about
me
offended
not
now
my
senses
merely
,
but
pierced
*NL*
my
heart
like
a
knife
,
so
that
I
could
not
repress
sighs
and
groans
.
I
*NL*
not
only
saw
but
felt
in
my
body
all
that
I
saw
.
*NL*
*NL*
Presently
,
too
,
as
I
observed
the
wretched
beings
about
me
more
*NL*
closely
,
I
perceived
that
they
were
all
quite
dead
.
Their
bodies
were
*NL*
so
many
living
sepulchres
.
On
each
brutal
brow
was
plainly
written
the
*NL*
_
hic
jacet
_
of
a
soul
dead
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
I
looked
,
horror
struck
,
from
one
death
's
head
to
another
,
I
was
*NL*
affected
by
a
singular
hallucination
.
Like
a
wavering
translucent
*NL*
spirit
face
superimposed
upon
each
of
these
brutish
masks
I
saw
the
*NL*
ideal
,
the
possible
face
that
would
have
been
the
actual
if
mind
and
*NL*
soul
had
lived
.
It
was
not
till
I
was
aware
of
these
ghostly
faces
,
*NL*
and
of
the
reproach
that
could
not
be
gainsaid
which
was
in
their
*NL*
eyes
,
that
the
full
piteousness
of
the
ruin
that
had
been
wrought
was
*NL*
revealed
to
me
.
I
was
moved
with
contrition
as
with
a
strong
agony
,
*NL*
for
I
had
been
one
of
those
who
had
endured
that
these
things
should
*NL*
be
.
I
had
been
one
of
those
who
,
well
knowing
that
they
were
,
had
not
*NL*
desired
to
hear
or
be
compelled
to
think
much
of
them
,
but
had
gone
on
*NL*
as
if
they
were
not
,
seeking
my
own
pleasure
and
profit
.
Therefore
now
*NL*
I
found
upon
my
garments
the
blood
of
this
great
multitude
of
*NL*
strangled
souls
of
my
brothers
.
The
voice
of
their
blood
cried
out
*NL*
against
me
from
the
ground
.
Every
stone
of
the
reeking
pavements
,
*NL*
every
brick
of
the
pestilential
rookeries
,
found
a
tongue
and
called
*NL*
after
me
as
I
fled
:
What
hast
thou
done
with
thy
brother
Abel
?
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
no
clear
recollection
of
anything
after
this
till
I
found
*NL*
myself
standing
on
the
carved
stone
steps
of
the
magnificent
home
of
*NL*
my
betrothed
in
Commonwealth
avenue
.
Amid
the
tumult
of
my
thoughts
*NL*
that
day
,
I
had
scarcely
once
thought
of
her
,
but
now
obeying
some
*NL*
unconscious
impulse
my
feet
had
found
the
familiar
way
to
her
door
.
I
*NL*
was
told
that
the
family
were
at
dinner
,
but
word
was
sent
out
that
I
*NL*
should
join
them
at
table
.
Besides
the
family
,
I
found
several
guests
*NL*
present
,
all
known
to
me
.
The
table
glittered
with
plate
and
costly
*NL*
china
.
The
ladies
were
sumptuously
dressed
and
wore
the
jewels
of
*NL*
queens
.
The
scene
was
one
of
costly
elegance
and
lavish
luxury
.
The
*NL*
company
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
there
was
plentiful
laughter
and
*NL*
a
running
fire
of
jests
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
me
it
was
as
if
,
in
wandering
through
the
place
of
doom
,
my
blood
*NL*
turned
to
tears
by
its
sights
,
and
my
spirit
attuned
to
sorrow
,
pity
,
*NL*
and
despair
,
I
had
happened
in
some
glade
upon
a
merry
party
of
*NL*
roisterers
.
I
sat
in
silence
until
Edith
began
to
rally
me
upon
my
*NL*
sombre
looks
,
What
ailed
me
?
The
others
presently
joined
in
the
*NL*
playful
assault
,
and
I
became
a
target
for
quips
and
jests
.
Where
had
*NL*
I
been
,
and
what
had
I
seen
to
make
such
a
dull
fellow
of
me
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
been
in
Golgotha
,
''
at
last
I
answered
.
``
I
have
seen
Humanity
*NL*
hanging
on
a
cross
!
Do
none
of
you
know
what
sights
the
sun
and
stars
*NL*
look
down
on
in
this
city
,
that
you
can
think
and
talk
of
anything
*NL*
else
?
Do
you
not
know
that
close
to
your
doors
a
great
multitude
of
*NL*
men
and
women
,
flesh
of
your
flesh
,
live
lives
that
are
one
agony
from
*NL*
birth
to
death
?
Listen
!
their
dwellings
are
so
near
that
if
you
hush
*NL*
your
laughter
you
will
hear
their
grievous
voices
,
the
piteous
crying
*NL*
of
the
little
ones
that
suckle
poverty
,
the
hoarse
curses
of
men
*NL*
sodden
in
misery
,
turned
half-way
back
to
brutes
,
the
chaffering
of
an
*NL*
army
of
women
selling
themselves
for
bread
.
With
what
have
you
stopped
*NL*
your
ears
that
you
do
not
hear
these
doleful
sounds
?
For
me
,
I
can
*NL*
hear
nothing
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Silence
followed
my
words
.
A
passion
of
pity
had
shaken
me
as
I
spoke
,
*NL*
but
when
I
looked
around
upon
the
company
,
I
saw
that
,
far
from
being
*NL*
stirred
as
I
was
,
their
faces
expressed
a
cold
and
hard
astonishment
,
*NL*
mingled
in
Edith
's
with
extreme
mortification
,
in
her
father
's
with
*NL*
anger
.
The
ladies
were
exchanging
scandalized
looks
,
while
one
of
the
*NL*
gentlemen
had
put
up
his
eyeglass
and
was
studying
me
with
an
air
of
*NL*
scientific
curiosity
,
When
I
saw
that
things
which
were
to
me
so
*NL*
intolerable
moved
them
not
at
all
,
that
words
that
melted
my
heart
to
*NL*
speak
had
only
offended
them
with
the
speaker
,
I
was
at
first
stunned
*NL*
and
then
overcome
with
a
desperate
sickness
and
faintness
at
the
*NL*
heart
.
What
hope
was
there
for
the
wretched
,
for
the
world
,
if
*NL*
thoughtful
men
and
tender
women
were
not
moved
by
things
like
these
!
*NL*
Then
I
bethought
myself
that
it
must
be
because
I
had
not
spoken
*NL*
aright
.
No
doubt
I
had
put
the
case
badly
.
They
were
angry
because
*NL*
they
thought
I
was
berating
them
,
when
God
knew
I
was
merely
thinking
*NL*
of
the
horror
of
the
fact
without
any
attempt
to
assign
the
*NL*
responsibility
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
restrained
my
passion
,
and
tried
to
speak
calmly
and
logically
that
*NL*
I
might
correct
this
impression
.
I
told
them
that
I
had
not
meant
to
*NL*
accuse
them
,
as
if
they
,
or
the
rich
in
general
,
were
responsible
for
*NL*
the
misery
of
the
world
.
True
indeed
it
was
,
that
the
superfluity
*NL*
which
they
wasted
would
,
otherwise
bestowed
,
relieve
much
bitter
*NL*
suffering
.
These
costly
viands
,
these
rich
wines
,
these
gorgeous
*NL*
fabrics
and
glistening
jewels
represented
the
ransom
of
many
lives
.
*NL*
They
were
verily
not
without
the
guiltiness
of
those
who
waste
in
a
*NL*
land
stricken
with
famine
.
Nevertheless
,
all
the
waste
of
all
the
*NL*
rich
,
were
it
saved
,
would
go
but
a
little
way
to
cure
the
poverty
of
*NL*
the
world
.
There
was
so
little
to
divide
that
even
if
the
rich
went
*NL*
share
and
share
with
the
poor
,
there
would
be
but
a
common
fare
of
*NL*
crusts
,
albeit
made
very
sweet
then
by
brotherly
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
folly
of
men
,
not
their
hard-heartedness
,
was
the
great
cause
of
*NL*
the
world
's
poverty
.
It
was
not
the
crime
of
man
,
nor
of
any
class
of
*NL*
men
,
that
made
the
race
so
miserable
,
but
a
hideous
,
ghastly
mistake
,
*NL*
a
colossal
world-darkening
blunder
.
And
then
I
showed
them
how
four
*NL*
fifths
of
the
labor
of
men
was
utterly
wasted
by
the
mutual
warfare
,
*NL*
the
lack
of
organization
and
concert
among
the
workers
.
Seeking
to
*NL*
make
the
matter
very
plain
,
I
instanced
the
case
of
arid
lands
where
*NL*
the
soil
yielded
the
means
of
life
only
by
careful
use
of
the
*NL*
watercourses
for
irrigation
.
I
showed
how
in
such
countries
it
was
*NL*
counted
the
most
important
function
of
the
government
to
see
that
the
*NL*
water
was
not
wasted
by
the
selfishness
or
ignorance
of
individuals
,
*NL*
since
otherwise
there
would
be
famine
.
To
this
end
its
use
was
*NL*
strictly
regulated
and
systematized
,
and
individuals
of
their
mere
*NL*
caprice
were
not
permitted
to
dam
it
or
divert
it
,
or
in
any
way
to
*NL*
tamper
with
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
labor
of
men
,
I
explained
,
was
the
fertilizing
stream
which
alone
*NL*
rendered
earth
habitable
.
It
was
but
a
scanty
stream
at
best
,
and
its
*NL*
use
required
to
be
regulated
by
a
system
which
expended
every
drop
to
*NL*
the
best
advantage
,
if
the
world
were
to
be
supported
in
abundance
.
*NL*
But
how
far
from
any
system
was
the
actual
practice
!
Every
man
wasted
*NL*
the
precious
fluid
as
he
wished
,
animated
only
by
the
equal
motives
of
*NL*
saving
his
own
crop
and
spoiling
his
neighbor
's
,
that
his
might
sell
*NL*
the
better
.
What
with
greed
and
what
with
spite
some
fields
were
*NL*
flooded
while
others
were
parched
,
and
half
the
water
ran
wholly
to
*NL*
waste
.
In
such
a
land
,
though
a
few
by
strength
or
cunning
might
win
*NL*
the
means
of
luxury
,
the
lot
of
the
great
mass
must
be
poverty
,
and
of
*NL*
the
weak
and
ignorant
bitter
want
and
perennial
famine
.
*NL*
*NL*
Let
but
the
famine-stricken
nation
assume
the
function
it
had
*NL*
neglected
,
and
regulate
for
the
common
good
the
course
of
the
*NL*
life-giving
stream
,
and
the
earth
would
bloom
like
one
garden
,
and
*NL*
none
of
its
children
lack
any
good
thing
.
I
described
the
physical
*NL*
felicity
,
mental
enlightenment
,
and
moral
elevation
which
would
then
*NL*
attend
the
lives
of
all
men
.
With
fervency
I
spoke
of
that
new
world
,
*NL*
blessed
with
plenty
,
purified
by
justice
and
sweetened
by
brotherly
*NL*
kindness
,
the
world
of
which
I
had
indeed
but
dreamed
,
but
which
might
*NL*
so
easily
be
made
real
.
But
when
I
had
expected
now
surely
the
faces
*NL*
around
me
to
light
up
with
emotions
akin
to
mine
,
they
grew
ever
more
*NL*
dark
,
angry
,
and
scornful
.
Instead
of
enthusiasm
,
the
ladies
showed
*NL*
only
aversion
and
dread
,
while
the
men
interrupted
me
with
shouts
of
*NL*
reprobation
and
contempt
.
``
Madman
!
''
``
Pestilent
fellow
!
''
``
Fanatic
!
''
*NL*
``
Enemy
of
society
!
''
were
some
of
their
cries
,
and
the
one
who
had
*NL*
before
taken
his
eyeglass
to
me
exclaimed
,
``
He
says
we
are
to
have
no
*NL*
more
poor
.
Ha
!
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Put
the
fellow
out
!
''
exclaimed
the
father
of
my
betrothed
,
and
at
the
*NL*
signal
the
men
sprang
from
their
chairs
and
advanced
upon
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
to
me
that
my
heart
would
burst
with
the
anguish
of
finding
*NL*
that
what
was
to
me
so
plain
and
so
all-important
was
to
them
*NL*
meaningless
,
and
that
I
was
powerless
to
make
it
other
.
So
hot
had
*NL*
been
my
heart
that
I
had
thought
to
melt
an
iceberg
with
its
glow
,
*NL*
only
to
find
at
last
the
overmastering
chill
seizing
my
own
vitals
.
It
*NL*
was
not
enmity
that
I
felt
toward
them
as
they
thronged
me
,
but
pity
*NL*
only
,
for
them
and
for
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
despairing
,
I
could
not
give
over
.
Still
I
strove
with
them
.
*NL*
Tears
poured
from
my
eyes
.
In
my
vehemence
I
became
inarticulate
.
I
*NL*
panted
,
I
sobbed
,
I
groaned
,
and
immediately
afterward
found
myself
*NL*
sitting
upright
in
bed
in
my
room
in
Dr.
Leete
's
house
,
and
the
*NL*
morning
sun
shining
through
the
open
window
into
my
eyes
.
I
was
*NL*
gasping
.
The
tears
were
streaming
down
my
face
,
and
I
quivered
in
*NL*
every
nerve
.
*NL*
*NL*
*
*
*
*
*
*NL*
*NL*
As
with
an
escaped
convict
who
dreams
that
he
has
been
recaptured
and
*NL*
brought
back
to
his
dark
and
reeking
dungeon
,
and
opens
his
eyes
to
*NL*
see
the
heaven
's
vault
spread
above
him
,
so
it
was
with
me
,
as
I
*NL*
realized
that
my
return
to
the
nineteenth
century
had
been
the
dream
,
*NL*
and
my
presence
in
the
twentieth
was
the
reality
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cruel
sights
which
I
had
witnessed
in
my
vision
,
and
could
so
well
*NL*
confirm
from
the
experience
of
my
former
life
,
though
they
had
,
alas
!
*NL*
once
been
,
and
must
in
the
retrospect
to
the
end
of
time
move
the
*NL*
compassionate
to
tears
,
were
,
God
be
thanked
,
forever
gone
by
.
Long
*NL*
ago
oppressor
and
oppressed
,
prophet
and
scorner
,
had
been
dust
.
For
*NL*
generations
,
rich
and
poor
had
been
forgotten
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
that
moment
,
while
yet
I
mused
with
unspeakable
thankfulness
*NL*
upon
the
greatness
of
the
world
's
salvation
and
my
privilege
in
*NL*
beholding
it
,
there
suddenly
pierced
me
like
a
knife
a
pang
of
shame
,
*NL*
remorse
,
and
wondering
self-reproach
,
that
bowed
my
head
upon
my
*NL*
breast
and
made
me
wish
the
grave
had
hid
me
with
my
fellows
from
the
*NL*
sun
.
For
I
had
been
a
man
of
that
former
time
.
What
had
I
done
to
help
*NL*
on
the
deliverance
whereat
I
now
presumed
to
rejoice
?
I
who
had
lived
*NL*
in
those
cruel
,
insensate
days
,
what
had
I
done
to
bring
them
to
an
*NL*
end
?
I
had
been
every
whit
as
indifferent
to
the
wretchedness
of
my
*NL*
brothers
,
as
cynically
incredulous
of
better
things
,
as
besotted
a
*NL*
worshipper
of
Chaos
and
Old
Night
,
as
any
of
my
fellows
.
So
far
as
my
*NL*
personal
influence
went
,
it
had
been
exerted
rather
to
hinder
than
to
*NL*
help
forward
the
enfranchisement
of
the
race
which
was
even
then
*NL*
preparing
.
What
right
had
I
to
hail
a
salvation
which
reproached
me
,
*NL*
to
rejoice
in
a
day
whose
dawning
I
had
mocked
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
for
you
,
better
for
you
,
''
a
voice
within
me
rang
,
``
had
this
*NL*
evil
dream
been
the
reality
,
and
this
fair
reality
the
dream
;
better
*NL*
your
part
pleading
for
crucified
humanity
with
a
scoffing
generation
,
*NL*
than
here
,
drinking
of
wells
you
digged
not
,
and
eating
of
trees
whose
*NL*
husbandmen
you
stoned
;
''
and
my
spirit
answered
,
``
Better
,
truly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
at
length
I
raised
my
bowed
head
and
looked
forth
from
the
*NL*
window
,
Edith
,
fresh
as
the
morning
,
had
come
into
the
garden
and
was
*NL*
gathering
flowers
.
I
hastened
to
descend
to
her
.
Kneeling
before
her
,
*NL*
with
my
face
in
the
dust
,
I
confessed
with
tears
how
little
was
my
*NL*
worth
to
breathe
the
air
of
this
golden
century
,
and
how
infinitely
*NL*
less
to
wear
upon
my
breast
its
consummate
flower
.
Fortunate
is
he
*NL*
who
,
with
a
case
so
desperate
as
mine
,
finds
a
judge
so
merciful

The
Transcript
of
March

,
*NL*
1888
,
contained
a
review
of
_
Looking
Backward
_
,
in
response
to
which
I
*NL*
beg
to
be
allowed
a
word
.
The
description
to
which
the
book
is
*NL*
devoted
,
of
the
radically
new
social
and
industrial
institutions
and
*NL*
arrangements
supposed
to
be
enjoyed
by
the
people
of
the
United
States
*NL*
in
the
twentieth
century
,
is
not
objected
to
as
depicting
a
degree
of
*NL*
human
felicity
and
moral
development
necessarily
unattainable
by
the
*NL*
race
,
provided
time
enough
had
been
allowed
for
its
evolution
from
the
*NL*
present
chaotic
state
of
society
.
In
failing
to
allow
this
,
the
*NL*
reviewer
thinks
that
the
author
has
made
an
absurd
mistake
,
which
*NL*
seriously
detracts
from
the
value
of
the
book
as
a
work
of
realistic
*NL*
imagination
.
Instead
of
placing
the
realization
of
the
ideal
social
*NL*
state
a
scant
fifty
years
ahead
,
it
is
suggested
that
he
should
have
*NL*
made
his
figure
seventy-five
centuries
.
There
is
certainly
a
large
*NL*
discrepancy
between
seventy-five
centuries
and
fifty
years
,
and
if
the
*NL*
reviewer
is
correct
in
his
estimate
of
the
probable
rate
of
human
*NL*
progress
,
the
outlook
of
the
world
is
decidedly
discouraging
.
But
is
*NL*
he
right
?
I
think
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
Looking
Backward
_
,
although
in
form
a
fanciful
romance
,
is
intended
,
*NL*
in
all
seriousness
,
as
a
forecast
,
in
accordance
with
the
principles
*NL*
of
evolution
,
of
the
next
stage
in
the
industrial
and
social
*NL*
development
of
humanity
,
especially
in
this
country
;
and
no
part
of
it
*NL*
is
believed
by
the
author
to
be
better
supported
by
the
indications
of
*NL*
probability
than
the
implied
prediction
that
the
dawn
of
the
new
era
*NL*
is
already
near
at
hand
,
and
that
the
full
day
will
swiftly
follow
.
*NL*
Does
this
seem
at
first
thought
incredible
,
in
view
of
the
vastness
of
*NL*
the
changes
presupposed
?
What
is
the
teaching
of
history
,
but
that
*NL*
great
national
transformations
,
while
ages
in
unnoticed
preparation
,
*NL*
when
once
inaugurated
,
are
accomplished
with
a
rapidity
and
resistless
*NL*
momentum
proportioned
to
their
magnitude
,
not
limited
by
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
In
1759
,
when
Quebec
fell
,
the
might
of
England
in
America
seemed
*NL*
irresistible
,
and
the
vassalage
of
the
colonies
assured
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
thirty
years
later
,
the
first
President
of
the
American
Republic
was
*NL*
inaugurated
.
In
1849
,
after
Novara
,
Italian
prospects
appeared
as
*NL*
hopeless
as
at
any
time
since
the
Middle
Ages
;
yet
only
fifteen
years
*NL*
after
,
Victor
Emmanuel
was
crowned
King
of
United
Italy
.
In
1864
,
the
*NL*
fulfillment
of
the
thousand-year
dream
of
German
unity
was
apparently
*NL*
as
far
off
as
ever
.
Seven
years
later
it
had
been
realized
,
and
*NL*
William
had
assumed
at
Versailles
the
Crown
of
Barbarossa
.
In
1832
,
*NL*
the
original
Anti-slavery
Society
was
formed
in
Boston
by
a
few
*NL*
so-called
visionaries
.
Thirty-eight
years
later
,
in
1870
,
the
society
*NL*
disbanded
,
its
programme
fully
carried
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
precedents
do
not
,
of
course
,
prove
that
any
such
industrial
and
*NL*
social
transformation
as
is
outlined
in
_
Looking
Backward
_
is
*NL*
impending
;
but
they
do
show
that
,
when
the
moral
and
economical
*NL*
conditions
for
it
are
ripe
,
it
may
be
expected
to
go
forward
with
*NL*
great
rapidity
.
On
no
other
stage
are
the
scenes
shifted
with
a
*NL*
swiftness
so
like
magic
as
on
the
great
stage
of
history
when
once
the
*NL*
hour
strikes
.
The
question
is
not
,
then
,
how
extensive
the
*NL*
scene-shifting
must
be
to
set
the
stage
for
the
new
fraternal
*NL*
civilization
,
but
whether
there
are
any
special
indications
that
a
*NL*
social
transformation
is
at
hand
.
The
causes
that
have
been
bringing
*NL*
it
ever
nearer
have
been
at
work
from
immemorial
time
.
To
the
stream
*NL*
of
tendency
setting
toward
an
ultimate
realization
of
a
form
of
*NL*
society
which
,
while
vastly
more
efficient
for
material
prosperity
,
*NL*
should
also
satisfy
and
not
outrage
the
moral
instincts
,
every
sigh
of
*NL*
poverty
,
every
tear
of
pity
,
every
humane
impulse
,
every
generous
*NL*
enthusiasm
,
every
true
religious
feeling
,
every
act
by
which
men
have
*NL*
given
effect
to
their
mutual
sympathy
by
drawing
more
closely
together
*NL*
for
any
purpose
,
have
contributed
from
the
beginnings
of
*NL*
civilization
.
That
this
long
stream
of
influence
,
ever
widening
and
*NL*
deepening
,
is
at
last
about
to
sweep
away
the
barriers
it
has
so
long
*NL*
sapped
,
is
at
least
one
obvious
interpretation
of
the
present
*NL*
universal
ferment
of
men
's
minds
as
to
the
imperfections
of
present
*NL*
social
arrangements
.
Not
only
are
the
toilers
of
the
world
engaged
in
*NL*
something
like
a
world-wide
insurrection
,
but
true
and
humane
men
and
*NL*
women
,
of
every
degree
,
are
in
a
mood
of
exasperation
,
verging
on
*NL*
absolute
revolt
,
against
social
conditions
that
reduce
life
to
a
*NL*
brutal
struggle
for
existence
,
mock
every
dictate
of
ethics
and
*NL*
religion
,
and
render
wellnigh
futile
the
efforts
of
philanthropy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
an
iceberg
,
floating
southward
from
the
frozen
North
,
is
gradually
*NL*
undermined
by
warmer
seas
,
and
,
become
at
last
unstable
,
churns
the
*NL*
sea
to
yeast
for
miles
around
by
the
mighty
rockings
that
portend
its
*NL*
overturn
,
so
the
barbaric
industrial
and
social
system
,
which
has
come
*NL*
down
to
us
from
savage
antiquity
,
undermined
by
the
modern
humane
*NL*
spirit
,
riddled
by
the
criticism
of
economic
science
,
is
shaking
the
*NL*
world
with
convulsions
that
presage
its
collapse
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
thoughtful
men
agree
that
the
present
aspect
of
society
is
*NL*
portentous
of
great
changes
.
The
only
question
is
,
whether
they
will
*NL*
be
for
the
better
or
the
worse
.
Those
who
believe
in
man
's
essential
*NL*
nobleness
lean
to
the
former
view
,
those
who
believe
in
his
essential
*NL*
baseness
to
the
latter
.
For
my
part
,
I
hold
to
the
former
opinion
.
*NL*
_
Looking
Backward
_
was
written
in
the
belief
that
the
Golden
Age
lies
*NL*
before
us
and
not
behind
us
,
and
is
not
far
away
.
Our
children
will
*NL*
surely
see
it
,
and
we
,
too
,
who
are
already
men
and
women
,
if
we
*NL*
deserve
it
by
our
faith
and
by
our
works
.
