LORD
JIM
*NL*
*NL*
BY
JOSEPH
CONRAD

AUTHOR
'S
NOTE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
novel
first
appeared
in
book
form
a
notion
got
about
that
*NL*
I
had
been
bolted
away
with
.
Some
reviewers
maintained
that
the
work
*NL*
starting
as
a
short
story
had
got
beyond
the
writer
's
control
.
One
or
*NL*
two
discovered
internal
evidence
of
the
fact
,
which
seemed
to
amuse
*NL*
them
.
They
pointed
out
the
limitations
of
the
narrative
form
.
They
*NL*
argued
that
no
man
could
have
been
expected
to
talk
all
that
time
,
and
*NL*
other
men
to
listen
so
long
.
It
was
not
,
they
said
,
very
credible
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
thinking
it
over
for
something
like
sixteen
years
,
I
am
not
so
*NL*
sure
about
that
.
Men
have
been
known
,
both
in
the
tropics
and
in
*NL*
the
temperate
zone
,
to
sit
up
half
the
night
`
swapping
yarns
'
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
is
but
one
yarn
,
yet
with
interruptions
affording
some
measure
*NL*
of
relief
;
and
in
regard
to
the
listeners
'
endurance
,
the
postulate
*NL*
must
be
accepted
that
the
story
was
interesting
.
It
is
the
necessary
*NL*
preliminary
assumption
.
If
I
had
n't
believed
that
it
was
interesting
I
*NL*
could
never
have
begun
to
write
it
.
As
to
the
mere
physical
possibility
*NL*
we
all
know
that
some
speeches
in
Parliament
have
taken
nearer
six
than
*NL*
three
hours
in
delivery
;
whereas
all
that
part
of
the
book
which
is
*NL*
Marlow
's
narrative
can
be
read
through
aloud
,
I
should
say
,
in
less
than
*NL*
three
hours
.
Besides
--
though
I
have
kept
strictly
all
such
insignificant
*NL*
details
out
of
the
tale
--
we
may
presume
that
there
must
have
been
*NL*
refreshments
on
that
night
,
a
glass
of
mineral
water
of
some
sort
to
*NL*
help
the
narrator
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
,
seriously
,
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
,
that
my
first
thought
was
*NL*
of
a
short
story
,
concerned
only
with
the
pilgrim
ship
episode
;
nothing
*NL*
more
.
And
that
was
a
legitimate
conception
.
After
writing
a
few
pages
,
*NL*
however
,
I
became
for
some
reason
discontented
and
I
laid
them
aside
for
*NL*
a
time
.
I
did
n't
take
them
out
of
the
drawer
till
the
late
Mr.
William
*NL*
Blackwood
suggested
I
should
give
something
again
to
his
magazine
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
then
that
I
perceived
that
the
pilgrim
ship
episode
was
a
*NL*
good
starting-point
for
a
free
and
wandering
tale
;
that
it
was
an
event
,
*NL*
too
,
which
could
conceivably
colour
the
whole
`
sentiment
of
existence
'
*NL*
in
a
simple
and
sensitive
character
.
But
all
these
preliminary
moods
*NL*
and
stirrings
of
spirit
were
rather
obscure
at
the
time
,
and
they
do
not
*NL*
appear
clearer
to
me
now
after
the
lapse
of
so
many
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
few
pages
I
had
laid
aside
were
not
without
their
weight
in
the
*NL*
choice
of
subject
.
But
the
whole
was
re-written
deliberately
.
When
I
sat
*NL*
down
to
it
I
knew
it
would
be
a
long
book
,
though
I
did
n't
foresee
that
*NL*
it
would
spread
itself
over
thirteen
numbers
of
Maga
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
been
asked
at
times
whether
this
was
not
the
book
of
mine
I
liked
*NL*
best
.
I
am
a
great
foe
to
favouritism
in
public
life
,
in
private
life
,
*NL*
and
even
in
the
delicate
relationship
of
an
author
to
his
works
.
As
a
*NL*
matter
of
principle
I
will
have
no
favourites
;
but
I
do
n't
go
so
far
*NL*
as
to
feel
grieved
and
annoyed
by
the
preference
some
people
give
to
*NL*
my
Lord
Jim
.
I
wo
n't
even
say
that
I
`
fail
to
understand
...
'
No
!
But
*NL*
once
I
had
occasion
to
be
puzzled
and
surprised
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
friend
of
mine
returning
from
Italy
had
talked
with
a
lady
there
who
*NL*
did
not
like
the
book
.
I
regretted
that
,
of
course
,
but
what
surprised
*NL*
me
was
the
ground
of
her
dislike
.
`
You
know
,
'
she
said
,
`
it
is
all
so
*NL*
morbid
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
pronouncement
gave
me
food
for
an
hour
's
anxious
thought
.
Finally
*NL*
I
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
,
making
due
allowances
for
the
subject
*NL*
itself
being
rather
foreign
to
women
's
normal
sensibilities
,
the
lady
*NL*
could
not
have
been
an
Italian
.
I
wonder
whether
she
was
European
at
*NL*
all
?
In
any
case
,
no
Latin
temperament
would
have
perceived
anything
*NL*
morbid
in
the
acute
consciousness
of
lost
honour
.
Such
a
consciousness
*NL*
may
be
wrong
,
or
it
may
be
right
,
or
it
may
be
condemned
as
artificial
;
*NL*
and
,
perhaps
,
my
Jim
is
not
a
type
of
wide
commonness
.
But
I
can
*NL*
safely
assure
my
readers
that
he
is
not
the
product
of
coldly
perverted
*NL*
thinking
.
He
's
not
a
figure
of
Northern
Mists
either
.
One
sunny
morning
,
*NL*
in
the
commonplace
surroundings
of
an
Eastern
roadstead
,
I
saw
his
form
*NL*
pass
by
--
appealing
--
significant
--
under
a
cloud
--
perfectly
silent
.
Which
*NL*
is
as
it
should
be
.
It
was
for
me
,
with
all
the
sympathy
of
which
I
was
*NL*
capable
,
to
seek
fit
words
for
his
meaning
.
He
was
`
one
of
us
'
.

LORD
JIM
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
1
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
an
inch
,
perhaps
two
,
under
six
feet
,
powerfully
built
,
and
he
*NL*
advanced
straight
at
you
with
a
slight
stoop
of
the
shoulders
,
head
*NL*
forward
,
and
a
fixed
from-under
stare
which
made
you
think
of
a
charging
*NL*
bull
.
His
voice
was
deep
,
loud
,
and
his
manner
displayed
a
kind
of
*NL*
dogged
self-assertion
which
had
nothing
aggressive
in
it
.
It
seemed
*NL*
a
necessity
,
and
it
was
directed
apparently
as
much
at
himself
as
at
*NL*
anybody
else
.
He
was
spotlessly
neat
,
apparelled
in
immaculate
white
*NL*
from
shoes
to
hat
,
and
in
the
various
Eastern
ports
where
he
got
his
*NL*
living
as
ship-chandler
's
water-clerk
he
was
very
popular
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
water-clerk
need
not
pass
an
examination
in
anything
under
the
sun
,
*NL*
but
he
must
have
Ability
in
the
abstract
and
demonstrate
it
practically
.
*NL*
His
work
consists
in
racing
under
sail
,
steam
,
or
oars
against
other
*NL*
water-clerks
for
any
ship
about
to
anchor
,
greeting
her
captain
*NL*
cheerily
,
forcing
upon
him
a
card
--
the
business
card
of
the
*NL*
ship-chandler
--
and
on
his
first
visit
on
shore
piloting
him
firmly
but
*NL*
without
ostentation
to
a
vast
,
cavern-like
shop
which
is
full
of
things
*NL*
that
are
eaten
and
drunk
on
board
ship
;
where
you
can
get
everything
*NL*
to
make
her
seaworthy
and
beautiful
,
from
a
set
of
chain-hooks
for
her
*NL*
cable
to
a
book
of
gold-leaf
for
the
carvings
of
her
stern
;
and
where
*NL*
her
commander
is
received
like
a
brother
by
a
ship-chandler
he
has
never
*NL*
seen
before
.
There
is
a
cool
parlour
,
easy-chairs
,
bottles
,
cigars
,
*NL*
writing
implements
,
a
copy
of
harbour
regulations
,
and
a
warmth
of
*NL*
welcome
that
melts
the
salt
of
a
three
months
'
passage
out
of
a
seaman
's
*NL*
heart
.
The
connection
thus
begun
is
kept
up
,
as
long
as
the
ship
remains
*NL*
in
harbour
,
by
the
daily
visits
of
the
water-clerk
.
To
the
captain
he
*NL*
is
faithful
like
a
friend
and
attentive
like
a
son
,
with
the
patience
*NL*
of
Job
,
the
unselfish
devotion
of
a
woman
,
and
the
jollity
of
a
boon
*NL*
companion
.
Later
on
the
bill
is
sent
in
.
It
is
a
beautiful
and
humane
*NL*
occupation
.
Therefore
good
water-clerks
are
scarce
.
When
a
water-clerk
*NL*
who
possesses
Ability
in
the
abstract
has
also
the
advantage
of
having
*NL*
been
brought
up
to
the
sea
,
he
is
worth
to
his
employer
a
lot
of
money
*NL*
and
some
humouring
.
Jim
had
always
good
wages
and
as
much
humouring
*NL*
as
would
have
bought
the
fidelity
of
a
fiend
.
Nevertheless
,
with
black
*NL*
ingratitude
he
would
throw
up
the
job
suddenly
and
depart
.
To
his
*NL*
employers
the
reasons
he
gave
were
obviously
inadequate
.
They
said
*NL*
`
Confounded
fool
!
'
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
.
This
was
their
*NL*
criticism
on
his
exquisite
sensibility
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
white
men
in
the
waterside
business
and
to
the
captains
of
ships
*NL*
he
was
just
Jim
--
nothing
more
.
He
had
,
of
course
,
another
name
,
but
he
*NL*
was
anxious
that
it
should
not
be
pronounced
.
His
incognito
,
which
had
*NL*
as
many
holes
as
a
sieve
,
was
not
meant
to
hide
a
personality
but
a
*NL*
fact
.
When
the
fact
broke
through
the
incognito
he
would
leave
*NL*
suddenly
the
seaport
where
he
happened
to
be
at
the
time
and
go
to
*NL*
another
--
generally
farther
east
.
He
kept
to
seaports
because
he
was
a
*NL*
seaman
in
exile
from
the
sea
,
and
had
Ability
in
the
abstract
,
which
is
*NL*
good
for
no
other
work
but
that
of
a
water-clerk
.
He
retreated
in
good
*NL*
order
towards
the
rising
sun
,
and
the
fact
followed
him
casually
but
*NL*
inevitably
.
Thus
in
the
course
of
years
he
was
known
successively
in
*NL*
Bombay
,
in
Calcutta
,
in
Rangoon
,
in
Penang
,
in
Batavia
--
and
in
each
of
*NL*
these
halting-places
was
just
Jim
the
water-clerk
.
Afterwards
,
when
his
*NL*
keen
perception
of
the
Intolerable
drove
him
away
for
good
from
seaports
*NL*
and
white
men
,
even
into
the
virgin
forest
,
the
Malays
of
the
jungle
*NL*
village
,
where
he
had
elected
to
conceal
his
deplorable
faculty
,
added
a
*NL*
word
to
the
monosyllable
of
his
incognito
.
They
called
him
Tuan
Jim
:
as
*NL*
one
might
say
--
Lord
Jim
.
*NL*
*NL*
Originally
he
came
from
a
parsonage
.
Many
commanders
of
fine
*NL*
merchant-ships
come
from
these
abodes
of
piety
and
peace
.
Jim
's
father
*NL*
possessed
such
certain
knowledge
of
the
Unknowable
as
made
for
the
*NL*
righteousness
of
people
in
cottages
without
disturbing
the
ease
of
mind
*NL*
of
those
whom
an
unerring
Providence
enables
to
live
in
mansions
.
The
*NL*
little
church
on
a
hill
had
the
mossy
greyness
of
a
rock
seen
through
a
*NL*
ragged
screen
of
leaves
.
It
had
stood
there
for
centuries
,
but
the
trees
*NL*
around
probably
remembered
the
laying
of
the
first
stone
.
Below
,
the
*NL*
red
front
of
the
rectory
gleamed
with
a
warm
tint
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
grass-plots
,
flower-beds
,
and
fir-trees
,
with
an
orchard
at
the
back
,
*NL*
a
paved
stable-yard
to
the
left
,
and
the
sloping
glass
of
greenhouses
*NL*
tacked
along
a
wall
of
bricks
.
The
living
had
belonged
to
the
family
for
*NL*
generations
;
but
Jim
was
one
of
five
sons
,
and
when
after
a
course
of
*NL*
light
holiday
literature
his
vocation
for
the
sea
had
declared
itself
,
*NL*
he
was
sent
at
once
to
a
`
training-ship
for
officers
of
the
mercantile
*NL*
marine
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
learned
there
a
little
trigonometry
and
how
to
cross
top-gallant
*NL*
yards
.
He
was
generally
liked
.
He
had
the
third
place
in
navigation
*NL*
and
pulled
stroke
in
the
first
cutter
.
Having
a
steady
head
with
an
*NL*
excellent
physique
,
he
was
very
smart
aloft
.
His
station
was
in
the
*NL*
fore-top
,
and
often
from
there
he
looked
down
,
with
the
contempt
of
a
*NL*
man
destined
to
shine
in
the
midst
of
dangers
,
at
the
peaceful
multitude
*NL*
of
roofs
cut
in
two
by
the
brown
tide
of
the
stream
,
while
scattered
*NL*
on
the
outskirts
of
the
surrounding
plain
the
factory
chimneys
rose
*NL*
perpendicular
against
a
grimy
sky
,
each
slender
like
a
pencil
,
and
*NL*
belching
out
smoke
like
a
volcano
.
He
could
see
the
big
ships
departing
,
*NL*
the
broad-beamed
ferries
constantly
on
the
move
,
the
little
boats
*NL*
floating
far
below
his
feet
,
with
the
hazy
splendour
of
the
sea
in
the
*NL*
distance
,
and
the
hope
of
a
stirring
life
in
the
world
of
adventure
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
lower
deck
in
the
babel
of
two
hundred
voices
he
would
forget
*NL*
himself
,
and
beforehand
live
in
his
mind
the
sea-life
of
light
*NL*
literature
.
He
saw
himself
saving
people
from
sinking
ships
,
cutting
*NL*
away
masts
in
a
hurricane
,
swimming
through
a
surf
with
a
line
;
or
as
a
*NL*
lonely
castaway
,
barefooted
and
half
naked
,
walking
on
uncovered
reefs
*NL*
in
search
of
shellfish
to
stave
off
starvation
.
He
confronted
savages
on
*NL*
tropical
shores
,
quelled
mutinies
on
the
high
seas
,
and
in
a
small
boat
*NL*
upon
the
ocean
kept
up
the
hearts
of
despairing
men
--
always
an
example
*NL*
of
devotion
to
duty
,
and
as
unflinching
as
a
hero
in
a
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Something
's
up
.
Come
along
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaped
to
his
feet
.
The
boys
were
streaming
up
the
ladders
.
Above
*NL*
could
be
heard
a
great
scurrying
about
and
shouting
,
and
when
he
got
*NL*
through
the
hatchway
he
stood
still
--
as
if
confounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
dusk
of
a
winter
's
day
.
The
gale
had
freshened
since
noon
,
*NL*
stopping
the
traffic
on
the
river
,
and
now
blew
with
the
strength
of
a
*NL*
hurricane
in
fitful
bursts
that
boomed
like
salvoes
of
great
guns
firing
*NL*
over
the
ocean
.
The
rain
slanted
in
sheets
that
flicked
and
subsided
,
*NL*
and
between
whiles
Jim
had
threatening
glimpses
of
the
tumbling
tide
,
*NL*
the
small
craft
jumbled
and
tossing
along
the
shore
,
the
motionless
*NL*
buildings
in
the
driving
mist
,
the
broad
ferry-boats
pitching
*NL*
ponderously
at
anchor
,
the
vast
landing-stages
heaving
up
and
down
and
*NL*
smothered
in
sprays
.
The
next
gust
seemed
to
blow
all
this
away
.
The
*NL*
air
was
full
of
flying
water
.
There
was
a
fierce
purpose
in
the
gale
,
a
*NL*
furious
earnestness
in
the
screech
of
the
wind
,
in
the
brutal
tumult
of
*NL*
earth
and
sky
,
that
seemed
directed
at
him
,
and
made
him
hold
his
breath
*NL*
in
awe
.
He
stood
still
.
It
seemed
to
him
he
was
whirled
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
jostled
.
`
Man
the
cutter
!
'
Boys
rushed
past
him
.
A
coaster
*NL*
running
in
for
shelter
had
crashed
through
a
schooner
at
anchor
,
and
one
*NL*
of
the
ship
's
instructors
had
seen
the
accident
.
A
mob
of
boys
clambered
*NL*
on
the
rails
,
clustered
round
the
davits
.
`
Collision
.
Just
ahead
of
us
.
*NL*
Mr.
Symons
saw
it
.
'
A
push
made
him
stagger
against
the
mizzen-mast
,
and
*NL*
he
caught
hold
of
a
rope
.
The
old
training-ship
chained
to
her
moorings
*NL*
quivered
all
over
,
bowing
gently
head
to
wind
,
and
with
her
scanty
*NL*
rigging
humming
in
a
deep
bass
the
breathless
song
of
her
youth
at
sea
.
*NL*
`
Lower
away
!
'
He
saw
the
boat
,
manned
,
drop
swiftly
below
the
rail
,
*NL*
and
rushed
after
her
.
He
heard
a
splash
.
`
Let
go
;
clear
the
falls
!
'
He
*NL*
leaned
over
.
The
river
alongside
seethed
in
frothy
streaks
.
The
cutter
*NL*
could
be
seen
in
the
falling
darkness
under
the
spell
of
tide
and
wind
,
*NL*
that
for
a
moment
held
her
bound
,
and
tossing
abreast
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
A
yelling
voice
in
her
reached
him
faintly
:
`
Keep
stroke
,
you
young
*NL*
whelps
,
if
you
want
to
save
anybody
!
Keep
stroke
!
'
And
suddenly
she
*NL*
lifted
high
her
bow
,
and
,
leaping
with
raised
oars
over
a
wave
,
broke
*NL*
the
spell
cast
upon
her
by
the
wind
and
tide
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
felt
his
shoulder
gripped
firmly
.
`
Too
late
,
youngster
.
'
The
captain
*NL*
of
the
ship
laid
a
restraining
hand
on
that
boy
,
who
seemed
on
the
*NL*
point
of
leaping
overboard
,
and
Jim
looked
up
with
the
pain
of
conscious
*NL*
defeat
in
his
eyes
.
The
captain
smiled
sympathetically
.
`
Better
luck
*NL*
next
time
.
This
will
teach
you
to
be
smart
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
A
shrill
cheer
greeted
the
cutter
.
She
came
dancing
back
half
full
of
*NL*
water
,
and
with
two
exhausted
men
washing
about
on
her
bottom
boards
.
*NL*
The
tumult
and
the
menace
of
wind
and
sea
now
appeared
very
contemptible
*NL*
to
Jim
,
increasing
the
regret
of
his
awe
at
their
inefficient
menace
.
*NL*
Now
he
knew
what
to
think
of
it
.
It
seemed
to
him
he
cared
nothing
for
*NL*
the
gale
.
He
could
affront
greater
perils
.
He
would
do
so
--
better
than
*NL*
anybody
.
Not
a
particle
of
fear
was
left
.
Nevertheless
he
brooded
apart
*NL*
that
evening
while
the
bowman
of
the
cutter
--
a
boy
with
a
face
like
*NL*
a
girl
's
and
big
grey
eyes
--
was
the
hero
of
the
lower
deck
.
Eager
*NL*
questioners
crowded
round
him
.
He
narrated
:
'
I
just
saw
his
head
*NL*
bobbing
,
and
I
dashed
my
boat-hook
in
the
water
.
It
caught
in
his
*NL*
breeches
and
I
nearly
went
overboard
,
as
I
thought
I
would
,
only
old
*NL*
Symons
let
go
the
tiller
and
grabbed
my
legs
--
the
boat
nearly
swamped
.
*NL*
Old
Symons
is
a
fine
old
chap
.
I
do
n't
mind
a
bit
him
being
grumpy
with
*NL*
us
.
He
swore
at
me
all
the
time
he
held
my
leg
,
but
that
was
only
his
*NL*
way
of
telling
me
to
stick
to
the
boat-hook
.
Old
Symons
is
awfully
*NL*
excitable
--
is
n't
he
?
No
--
not
the
little
fair
chap
--
the
other
,
the
big
*NL*
one
with
a
beard
.
When
we
pulled
him
in
he
groaned
,
``
Oh
,
my
leg
!
oh
,
*NL*
my
leg
!
''
and
turned
up
his
eyes
.
Fancy
such
a
big
chap
fainting
like
*NL*
a
girl
.
Would
any
of
you
fellows
faint
for
a
jab
with
a
boat-hook
?
--
I
*NL*
would
n't
.
It
went
into
his
leg
so
far
.
'
He
showed
the
boat-hook
,
which
*NL*
he
had
carried
below
for
the
purpose
,
and
produced
a
sensation
.
`
No
,
*NL*
silly
!
It
was
not
his
flesh
that
held
him
--
his
breeches
did
.
Lots
of
*NL*
blood
,
of
course
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
thought
it
a
pitiful
display
of
vanity
.
The
gale
had
ministered
to
*NL*
a
heroism
as
spurious
as
its
own
pretence
of
terror
.
He
felt
angry
with
*NL*
the
brutal
tumult
of
earth
and
sky
for
taking
him
unawares
and
checking
*NL*
unfairly
a
generous
readiness
for
narrow
escapes
.
Otherwise
he
was
*NL*
rather
glad
he
had
not
gone
into
the
cutter
,
since
a
lower
achievement
*NL*
had
served
the
turn
.
He
had
enlarged
his
knowledge
more
than
those
who
*NL*
had
done
the
work
.
When
all
men
flinched
,
then
--
he
felt
sure
--
he
alone
*NL*
would
know
how
to
deal
with
the
spurious
menace
of
wind
and
seas
.
He
*NL*
knew
what
to
think
of
it
.
Seen
dispassionately
,
it
seemed
contemptible
.
*NL*
He
could
detect
no
trace
of
emotion
in
himself
,
and
the
final
effect
of
*NL*
a
staggering
event
was
that
,
unnoticed
and
apart
from
the
noisy
crowd
of
*NL*
boys
,
he
exulted
with
fresh
certitude
in
his
avidity
for
adventure
,
and
*NL*
in
a
sense
of
many-sided
courage
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
2
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
After
two
years
of
training
he
went
to
sea
,
and
entering
the
regions
so
*NL*
well
known
to
his
imagination
,
found
them
strangely
barren
of
adventure
.
*NL*
He
made
many
voyages
.
He
knew
the
magic
monotony
of
existence
between
*NL*
sky
and
water
:
he
had
to
bear
the
criticism
of
men
,
the
exactions
of
the
*NL*
sea
,
and
the
prosaic
severity
of
the
daily
task
that
gives
bread
--
but
*NL*
whose
only
reward
is
in
the
perfect
love
of
the
work
.
This
reward
eluded
*NL*
him
.
Yet
he
could
not
go
back
,
because
there
is
nothing
more
enticing
,
*NL*
disenchanting
,
and
enslaving
than
the
life
at
sea
.
Besides
,
his
*NL*
prospects
were
good
.
He
was
gentlemanly
,
steady
,
tractable
,
with
a
*NL*
thorough
knowledge
of
his
duties
;
and
in
time
,
when
yet
very
young
,
he
*NL*
became
chief
mate
of
a
fine
ship
,
without
ever
having
been
tested
by
*NL*
those
events
of
the
sea
that
show
in
the
light
of
day
the
inner
worth
of
*NL*
a
man
,
the
edge
of
his
temper
,
and
the
fibre
of
his
stuff
;
that
reveal
*NL*
the
quality
of
his
resistance
and
the
secret
truth
of
his
pretences
,
not
*NL*
only
to
others
but
also
to
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
once
in
all
that
time
he
had
again
a
glimpse
of
the
earnestness
in
*NL*
the
anger
of
the
sea
.
That
truth
is
not
so
often
made
apparent
as
people
*NL*
might
think
.
There
are
many
shades
in
the
danger
of
adventures
and
*NL*
gales
,
and
it
is
only
now
and
then
that
there
appears
on
the
face
of
*NL*
facts
a
sinister
violence
of
intention
--
that
indefinable
something
which
*NL*
forces
it
upon
the
mind
and
the
heart
of
a
man
,
that
this
complication
*NL*
of
accidents
or
these
elemental
furies
are
coming
at
him
with
a
purpose
*NL*
of
malice
,
with
a
strength
beyond
control
,
with
an
unbridled
cruelty
*NL*
that
means
to
tear
out
of
him
his
hope
and
his
fear
,
the
pain
of
his
*NL*
fatigue
and
his
longing
for
rest
:
which
means
to
smash
,
to
destroy
,
to
*NL*
annihilate
all
he
has
seen
,
known
,
loved
,
enjoyed
,
or
hated
;
all
that
is
*NL*
priceless
and
necessary
--
the
sunshine
,
the
memories
,
the
future
;
which
*NL*
means
to
sweep
the
whole
precious
world
utterly
away
from
his
sight
by
*NL*
the
simple
and
appalling
act
of
taking
his
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
,
disabled
by
a
falling
spar
at
the
beginning
of
a
week
of
which
his
*NL*
Scottish
captain
used
to
say
afterwards
,
`
Man
!
it
's
a
pairfect
meeracle
*NL*
to
me
how
she
lived
through
it
!
'
spent
many
days
stretched
on
his
back
,
*NL*
dazed
,
battered
,
hopeless
,
and
tormented
as
if
at
the
bottom
of
an
*NL*
abyss
of
unrest
.
He
did
not
care
what
the
end
would
be
,
and
in
his
lucid
*NL*
moments
overvalued
his
indifference
.
The
danger
,
when
not
seen
,
has
*NL*
the
imperfect
vagueness
of
human
thought
.
The
fear
grows
shadowy
;
and
*NL*
Imagination
,
the
enemy
of
men
,
the
father
of
all
terrors
,
unstimulated
,
*NL*
sinks
to
rest
in
the
dullness
of
exhausted
emotion
.
Jim
saw
nothing
*NL*
but
the
disorder
of
his
tossed
cabin
.
He
lay
there
battened
down
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
a
small
devastation
,
and
felt
secretly
glad
he
had
not
to
go
on
*NL*
deck
.
But
now
and
again
an
uncontrollable
rush
of
anguish
would
grip
*NL*
him
bodily
,
make
him
gasp
and
writhe
under
the
blankets
,
and
then
the
*NL*
unintelligent
brutality
of
an
existence
liable
to
the
agony
of
such
*NL*
sensations
filled
him
with
a
despairing
desire
to
escape
at
any
cost
.
*NL*
Then
fine
weather
returned
,
and
he
thought
no
more
about
It
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
lameness
,
however
,
persisted
,
and
when
the
ship
arrived
at
an
*NL*
Eastern
port
he
had
to
go
to
the
hospital
.
His
recovery
was
slow
,
and
he
*NL*
was
left
behind
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
two
other
patients
in
the
white
men
's
ward
:
the
purser
*NL*
of
a
gunboat
,
who
had
broken
his
leg
falling
down
a
hatchway
;
and
a
kind
*NL*
of
railway
contractor
from
a
neighbouring
province
,
afflicted
by
*NL*
some
mysterious
tropical
disease
,
who
held
the
doctor
for
an
ass
,
and
*NL*
indulged
in
secret
debaucheries
of
patent
medicine
which
his
Tamil
*NL*
servant
used
to
smuggle
in
with
unwearied
devotion
.
They
told
each
other
*NL*
the
story
of
their
lives
,
played
cards
a
little
,
or
,
yawning
and
in
*NL*
pyjamas
,
lounged
through
the
day
in
easy-chairs
without
saying
a
word
.
*NL*
The
hospital
stood
on
a
hill
,
and
a
gentle
breeze
entering
through
the
*NL*
windows
,
always
flung
wide
open
,
brought
into
the
bare
room
the
softness
*NL*
of
the
sky
,
the
languor
of
the
earth
,
the
bewitching
breath
of
the
*NL*
Eastern
waters
.
There
were
perfumes
in
it
,
suggestions
of
infinite
*NL*
repose
,
the
gift
of
endless
dreams
.
Jim
looked
every
day
over
the
*NL*
thickets
of
gardens
,
beyond
the
roofs
of
the
town
,
over
the
fronds
of
*NL*
palms
growing
on
the
shore
,
at
that
roadstead
which
is
a
thoroughfare
*NL*
to
the
East
,
--
at
the
roadstead
dotted
by
garlanded
islets
,
lighted
by
*NL*
festal
sunshine
,
its
ships
like
toys
,
its
brilliant
activity
resembling
*NL*
a
holiday
pageant
,
with
the
eternal
serenity
of
the
Eastern
sky
overhead
*NL*
and
the
smiling
peace
of
the
Eastern
seas
possessing
the
space
as
far
as
*NL*
the
horizon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
he
could
walk
without
a
stick
,
he
descended
into
the
town
to
*NL*
look
for
some
opportunity
to
get
home
.
Nothing
offered
just
then
,
and
,
*NL*
while
waiting
,
he
associated
naturally
with
the
men
of
his
calling
in
*NL*
the
port
.
These
were
of
two
kinds
.
Some
,
very
few
and
seen
there
but
*NL*
seldom
,
led
mysterious
lives
,
had
preserved
an
undefaced
energy
with
the
*NL*
temper
of
buccaneers
and
the
eyes
of
dreamers
.
They
appeared
to
live
*NL*
in
a
crazy
maze
of
plans
,
hopes
,
dangers
,
enterprises
,
ahead
of
*NL*
civilisation
,
in
the
dark
places
of
the
sea
;
and
their
death
was
the
*NL*
only
event
of
their
fantastic
existence
that
seemed
to
have
a
reasonable
*NL*
certitude
of
achievement
.
The
majority
were
men
who
,
like
himself
,
*NL*
thrown
there
by
some
accident
,
had
remained
as
officers
of
country
*NL*
ships
.
They
had
now
a
horror
of
the
home
service
,
with
its
harder
*NL*
conditions
,
severer
view
of
duty
,
and
the
hazard
of
stormy
oceans
.
They
*NL*
were
attuned
to
the
eternal
peace
of
Eastern
sky
and
sea
.
They
*NL*
loved
short
passages
,
good
deck-chairs
,
large
native
crews
,
and
the
*NL*
distinction
of
being
white
.
They
shuddered
at
the
thought
of
hard
work
,
*NL*
and
led
precariously
easy
lives
,
always
on
the
verge
of
dismissal
,
*NL*
always
on
the
verge
of
engagement
,
serving
Chinamen
,
Arabs
,
*NL*
half-castes
--
would
have
served
the
devil
himself
had
he
made
it
easy
*NL*
enough
.
They
talked
everlastingly
of
turns
of
luck
:
how
So-and-so
got
*NL*
charge
of
a
boat
on
the
coast
of
China
--
a
soft
thing
;
how
this
one
had
*NL*
an
easy
billet
in
Japan
somewhere
,
and
that
one
was
doing
well
in
the
*NL*
Siamese
navy
;
and
in
all
they
said
--
in
their
actions
,
in
their
looks
,
in
*NL*
their
persons
--
could
be
detected
the
soft
spot
,
the
place
of
decay
,
the
*NL*
determination
to
lounge
safely
through
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Jim
that
gossiping
crowd
,
viewed
as
seamen
,
seemed
at
first
more
*NL*
unsubstantial
than
so
many
shadows
.
But
at
length
he
found
a
fascination
*NL*
in
the
sight
of
those
men
,
in
their
appearance
of
doing
so
well
on
*NL*
such
a
small
allowance
of
danger
and
toil
.
In
time
,
beside
the
original
*NL*
disdain
there
grew
up
slowly
another
sentiment
;
and
suddenly
,
giving
up
*NL*
the
idea
of
going
home
,
he
took
a
berth
as
chief
mate
of
the
Patna
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Patna
was
a
local
steamer
as
old
as
the
hills
,
lean
like
a
*NL*
greyhound
,
and
eaten
up
with
rust
worse
than
a
condemned
water-tank
.
She
*NL*
was
owned
by
a
Chinaman
,
chartered
by
an
Arab
,
and
commanded
by
a
sort
*NL*
of
renegade
New
South
Wales
German
,
very
anxious
to
curse
publicly
*NL*
his
native
country
,
but
who
,
apparently
on
the
strength
of
Bismarck
's
*NL*
victorious
policy
,
brutalised
all
those
he
was
not
afraid
of
,
and
wore
a
*NL*
`
blood-and-iron
'
air
,
'
combined
with
a
purple
nose
and
a
red
moustache
.
*NL*
After
she
had
been
painted
outside
and
whitewashed
inside
,
eight
hundred
*NL*
pilgrims
-LRB-
more
or
less
-RRB-
were
driven
on
board
of
her
as
she
lay
with
*NL*
steam
up
alongside
a
wooden
jetty
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
streamed
aboard
over
three
gangways
,
they
streamed
in
urged
by
*NL*
faith
and
the
hope
of
paradise
,
they
streamed
in
with
a
continuous
tramp
*NL*
and
shuffle
of
bare
feet
,
without
a
word
,
a
murmur
,
or
a
look
back
;
and
*NL*
when
clear
of
confining
rails
spread
on
all
sides
over
the
deck
,
flowed
*NL*
forward
and
aft
,
overflowed
down
the
yawning
hatchways
,
filled
the
inner
*NL*
recesses
of
the
ship
--
like
water
filling
a
cistern
,
like
water
flowing
*NL*
into
crevices
and
crannies
,
like
water
rising
silently
even
with
the
*NL*
rim
.
Eight
hundred
men
and
women
with
faith
and
hopes
,
with
affections
*NL*
and
memories
,
they
had
collected
there
,
coming
from
north
and
south
*NL*
and
from
the
outskirts
of
the
East
,
after
treading
the
jungle
paths
,
*NL*
descending
the
rivers
,
coasting
in
praus
along
the
shallows
,
crossing
in
*NL*
small
canoes
from
island
to
island
,
passing
through
suffering
,
meeting
*NL*
strange
sights
,
beset
by
strange
fears
,
upheld
by
one
desire
.
They
*NL*
came
from
solitary
huts
in
the
wilderness
,
from
populous
campongs
,
from
*NL*
villages
by
the
sea
.
At
the
call
of
an
idea
they
had
left
their
forests
,
*NL*
their
clearings
,
the
protection
of
their
rulers
,
their
prosperity
,
*NL*
their
poverty
,
the
surroundings
of
their
youth
and
the
graves
of
their
*NL*
fathers
.
They
came
covered
with
dust
,
with
sweat
,
with
grime
,
with
*NL*
rags
--
the
strong
men
at
the
head
of
family
parties
,
the
lean
old
men
*NL*
pressing
forward
without
hope
of
return
;
young
boys
with
fearless
eyes
*NL*
glancing
curiously
,
shy
little
girls
with
tumbled
long
hair
;
the
timid
*NL*
women
muffled
up
and
clasping
to
their
breasts
,
wrapped
in
loose
ends
of
*NL*
soiled
head-cloths
,
their
sleeping
babies
,
the
unconscious
pilgrims
of
*NL*
an
exacting
belief
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Look
at
dese
cattle
,
'
said
the
German
skipper
to
his
new
chief
mate
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
Arab
,
the
leader
of
that
pious
voyage
,
came
last
.
He
walked
slowly
*NL*
aboard
,
handsome
and
grave
in
his
white
gown
and
large
turban
.
A
string
*NL*
of
servants
followed
,
loaded
with
his
luggage
;
the
Patna
cast
off
and
*NL*
backed
away
from
the
wharf
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
headed
between
two
small
islets
,
crossed
obliquely
the
*NL*
anchoring-ground
of
sailing-ships
,
swung
through
half
a
circle
in
the
*NL*
shadow
of
a
hill
,
then
ranged
close
to
a
ledge
of
foaming
reefs
.
The
*NL*
Arab
,
standing
up
aft
,
recited
aloud
the
prayer
of
travellers
by
sea
.
*NL*
He
invoked
the
favour
of
the
Most
High
upon
that
journey
,
implored
His
*NL*
blessing
on
men
's
toil
and
on
the
secret
purposes
of
their
hearts
;
the
*NL*
steamer
pounded
in
the
dusk
the
calm
water
of
the
Strait
;
and
far
astern
*NL*
of
the
pilgrim
ship
a
screw-pile
lighthouse
,
planted
by
unbelievers
on
*NL*
a
treacherous
shoal
,
seemed
to
wink
at
her
its
eye
of
flame
,
as
if
in
*NL*
derision
of
her
errand
of
faith
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
cleared
the
Strait
,
crossed
the
bay
,
continued
on
her
way
through
*NL*
the
`
One-degree
'
passage
.
She
held
on
straight
for
the
Red
Sea
under
a
*NL*
serene
sky
,
under
a
sky
scorching
and
unclouded
,
enveloped
in
a
fulgor
*NL*
of
sunshine
that
killed
all
thought
,
oppressed
the
heart
,
withered
all
*NL*
impulses
of
strength
and
energy
.
And
under
the
sinister
splendour
of
*NL*
that
sky
the
sea
,
blue
and
profound
,
remained
still
,
without
a
stir
,
*NL*
without
a
ripple
,
without
a
wrinkle
--
viscous
,
stagnant
,
dead
.
The
*NL*
Patna
,
with
a
slight
hiss
,
passed
over
that
plain
,
luminous
and
smooth
,
*NL*
unrolled
a
black
ribbon
of
smoke
across
the
sky
,
left
behind
her
on
the
*NL*
water
a
white
ribbon
of
foam
that
vanished
at
once
,
like
the
phantom
of
*NL*
a
track
drawn
upon
a
lifeless
sea
by
the
phantom
of
a
steamer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
morning
the
sun
,
as
if
keeping
pace
in
his
revolutions
with
the
*NL*
progress
of
the
pilgrimage
,
emerged
with
a
silent
burst
of
light
exactly
*NL*
at
the
same
distance
astern
of
the
ship
,
caught
up
with
her
at
noon
,
*NL*
pouring
the
concentrated
fire
of
his
rays
on
the
pious
purposes
of
the
*NL*
men
,
glided
past
on
his
descent
,
and
sank
mysteriously
into
the
sea
*NL*
evening
after
evening
,
preserving
the
same
distance
ahead
of
her
*NL*
advancing
bows
.
The
five
whites
on
board
lived
amidships
,
isolated
from
*NL*
the
human
cargo
.
The
awnings
covered
the
deck
with
a
white
roof
from
*NL*
stem
to
stern
,
and
a
faint
hum
,
a
low
murmur
of
sad
voices
,
alone
*NL*
revealed
the
presence
of
a
crowd
of
people
upon
the
great
blaze
of
the
*NL*
ocean
.
Such
were
the
days
,
still
,
hot
,
heavy
,
disappearing
one
by
one
*NL*
into
the
past
,
as
if
falling
into
an
abyss
for
ever
open
in
the
wake
*NL*
of
the
ship
;
and
the
ship
,
lonely
under
a
wisp
of
smoke
,
held
on
her
*NL*
steadfast
way
black
and
smouldering
in
a
luminous
immensity
,
as
if
*NL*
scorched
by
a
flame
flicked
at
her
from
a
heaven
without
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
nights
descended
on
her
like
a
benediction
.

CHAPTER
3
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
marvellous
stillness
pervaded
the
world
,
and
the
stars
,
together
with
*NL*
the
serenity
of
their
rays
,
seemed
to
shed
upon
the
earth
the
assurance
*NL*
of
everlasting
security
.
The
young
moon
recurved
,
and
shining
low
in
the
*NL*
west
,
was
like
a
slender
shaving
thrown
up
from
a
bar
of
gold
,
and
the
*NL*
Arabian
Sea
,
smooth
and
cool
to
the
eye
like
a
sheet
of
ice
,
extended
*NL*
its
perfect
level
to
the
perfect
circle
of
a
dark
horizon
.
The
propeller
*NL*
turned
without
a
check
,
as
though
its
beat
had
been
part
of
the
scheme
*NL*
of
a
safe
universe
;
and
on
each
side
of
the
Patna
two
deep
folds
of
*NL*
water
,
permanent
and
sombre
on
the
unwrinkled
shimmer
,
enclosed
within
*NL*
their
straight
and
diverging
ridges
a
few
white
swirls
of
foam
bursting
*NL*
in
a
low
hiss
,
a
few
wavelets
,
a
few
ripples
,
a
few
undulations
that
,
*NL*
left
behind
,
agitated
the
surface
of
the
sea
for
an
instant
after
the
*NL*
passage
of
the
ship
,
subsided
splashing
gently
,
calmed
down
at
last
*NL*
into
the
circular
stillness
of
water
and
sky
with
the
black
speck
of
the
*NL*
moving
hull
remaining
everlastingly
in
its
centre
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
on
the
bridge
was
penetrated
by
the
great
certitude
of
unbounded
*NL*
safety
and
peace
that
could
be
read
on
the
silent
aspect
of
nature
like
*NL*
the
certitude
of
fostering
love
upon
the
placid
tenderness
of
a
mother
's
*NL*
face
.
Below
the
roof
of
awnings
,
surrendered
to
the
wisdom
of
white
men
*NL*
and
to
their
courage
,
trusting
the
power
of
their
unbelief
and
the
iron
*NL*
shell
of
their
fire-ship
,
the
pilgrims
of
an
exacting
faith
slept
*NL*
on
mats
,
on
blankets
,
on
bare
planks
,
on
every
deck
,
in
all
the
dark
*NL*
corners
,
wrapped
in
dyed
cloths
,
muffled
in
soiled
rags
,
with
their
*NL*
heads
resting
on
small
bundles
,
with
their
faces
pressed
to
bent
*NL*
forearms
:
the
men
,
the
women
,
the
children
;
the
old
with
the
young
,
the
*NL*
decrepit
with
the
lusty
--
all
equal
before
sleep
,
death
's
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
draught
of
air
,
fanned
from
forward
by
the
speed
of
the
ship
,
passed
*NL*
steadily
through
the
long
gloom
between
the
high
bulwarks
,
swept
over
*NL*
the
rows
of
prone
bodies
;
a
few
dim
flames
in
globe-lamps
were
hung
*NL*
short
here
and
there
under
the
ridge-poles
,
and
in
the
blurred
circles
*NL*
of
light
thrown
down
and
trembling
slightly
to
the
unceasing
vibration
*NL*
of
the
ship
appeared
a
chin
upturned
,
two
closed
eyelids
,
a
dark
hand
*NL*
with
silver
rings
,
a
meagre
limb
draped
in
a
torn
covering
,
a
head
bent
*NL*
back
,
a
naked
foot
,
a
throat
bared
and
stretched
as
if
offering
itself
*NL*
to
the
knife
.
The
well-to-do
had
made
for
their
families
shelters
with
*NL*
heavy
boxes
and
dusty
mats
;
the
poor
reposed
side
by
side
with
all
they
*NL*
had
on
earth
tied
up
in
a
rag
under
their
heads
;
the
lone
old
men
slept
,
*NL*
with
drawn-up
legs
,
upon
their
prayer-carpets
,
with
their
hands
over
*NL*
their
ears
and
one
elbow
on
each
side
of
the
face
;
a
father
,
his
*NL*
shoulders
up
and
his
knees
under
his
forehead
,
dozed
dejectedly
by
a
*NL*
boy
who
slept
on
his
back
with
tousled
hair
and
one
arm
commandingly
*NL*
extended
;
a
woman
covered
from
head
to
foot
,
like
a
corpse
,
with
a
piece
*NL*
of
white
sheeting
,
had
a
naked
child
in
the
hollow
of
each
arm
;
the
*NL*
Arab
's
belongings
,
piled
right
aft
,
made
a
heavy
mound
of
broken
*NL*
outlines
,
with
a
cargo-lamp
swung
above
,
and
a
great
confusion
of
*NL*
vague
forms
behind
:
gleams
of
paunchy
brass
pots
,
the
foot-rest
of
a
*NL*
deck-chair
,
blades
of
spears
,
the
straight
scabbard
of
an
old
sword
*NL*
leaning
against
a
heap
of
pillows
,
the
spout
of
a
tin
coffee-pot
.
The
*NL*
patent
log
on
the
taffrail
periodically
rang
a
single
tinkling
stroke
*NL*
for
every
mile
traversed
on
an
errand
of
faith
.
Above
the
mass
of
*NL*
sleepers
a
faint
and
patient
sigh
at
times
floated
,
the
exhalation
of
a
*NL*
troubled
dream
;
and
short
metallic
clangs
bursting
out
suddenly
in
the
*NL*
depths
of
the
ship
,
the
harsh
scrape
of
a
shovel
,
the
violent
slam
of
a
*NL*
furnace-door
,
exploded
brutally
,
as
if
the
men
handling
the
mysterious
*NL*
things
below
had
their
breasts
full
of
fierce
anger
:
while
the
slim
high
*NL*
hull
of
the
steamer
went
on
evenly
ahead
,
without
a
sway
of
her
bare
*NL*
masts
,
cleaving
continuously
the
great
calm
of
the
waters
under
the
*NL*
inaccessible
serenity
of
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
paced
athwart
,
and
his
footsteps
in
the
vast
silence
were
loud
to
*NL*
his
own
ears
,
as
if
echoed
by
the
watchful
stars
:
his
eyes
,
roaming
*NL*
about
the
line
of
the
horizon
,
seemed
to
gaze
hungrily
into
the
*NL*
unattainable
,
and
did
not
see
the
shadow
of
the
coming
event
.
The
only
*NL*
shadow
on
the
sea
was
the
shadow
of
the
black
smoke
pouring
heavily
from
*NL*
the
funnel
its
immense
streamer
,
whose
end
was
constantly
dissolving
in
*NL*
the
air
.
Two
Malays
,
silent
and
almost
motionless
,
steered
,
one
on
each
*NL*
side
of
the
wheel
,
whose
brass
rim
shone
fragmentarily
in
the
oval
*NL*
of
light
thrown
out
by
the
binnacle
.
Now
and
then
a
hand
,
with
black
*NL*
fingers
alternately
letting
go
and
catching
hold
of
revolving
spokes
,
*NL*
appeared
in
the
illumined
part
;
the
links
of
wheel-chains
ground
heavily
*NL*
in
the
grooves
of
the
barrel
.
Jim
would
glance
at
the
compass
,
would
*NL*
glance
around
the
unattainable
horizon
,
would
stretch
himself
till
his
*NL*
joints
cracked
,
with
a
leisurely
twist
of
the
body
,
in
the
very
excess
*NL*
of
well-being
;
and
,
as
if
made
audacious
by
the
invincible
aspect
of
the
*NL*
peace
,
he
felt
he
cared
for
nothing
that
could
happen
to
him
to
the
end
*NL*
of
his
days
.
From
time
to
time
he
glanced
idly
at
a
chart
pegged
*NL*
out
with
four
drawing-pins
on
a
low
three-legged
table
abaft
the
*NL*
steering-gear
case
.
The
sheet
of
paper
portraying
the
depths
of
the
sea
*NL*
presented
a
shiny
surface
under
the
light
of
a
bull
's
-
eye
lamp
lashed
to
*NL*
a
stanchion
,
a
surface
as
level
and
smooth
as
the
glimmering
surface
of
*NL*
the
waters
.
Parallel
rulers
with
a
pair
of
dividers
reposed
on
it
;
the
*NL*
ship
's
position
at
last
noon
was
marked
with
a
small
black
cross
,
and
*NL*
the
straight
pencil-line
drawn
firmly
as
far
as
Perim
figured
the
course
*NL*
of
the
ship
--
the
path
of
souls
towards
the
holy
place
,
the
promise
of
*NL*
salvation
,
the
reward
of
eternal
life
--
while
the
pencil
with
its
sharp
*NL*
end
touching
the
Somali
coast
lay
round
and
still
like
a
naked
ship
's
*NL*
spar
floating
in
the
pool
of
a
sheltered
dock
.
`
How
steady
she
goes
,
'
*NL*
thought
Jim
with
wonder
,
with
something
like
gratitude
for
this
high
*NL*
peace
of
sea
and
sky
.
At
such
times
his
thoughts
would
be
full
of
*NL*
valorous
deeds
:
he
loved
these
dreams
and
the
success
of
his
imaginary
*NL*
achievements
.
They
were
the
best
parts
of
life
,
its
secret
truth
,
its
*NL*
hidden
reality
.
They
had
a
gorgeous
virility
,
the
charm
of
vagueness
,
*NL*
they
passed
before
him
with
an
heroic
tread
;
they
carried
his
soul
away
*NL*
with
them
and
made
it
drunk
with
the
divine
philtre
of
an
unbounded
*NL*
confidence
in
itself
.
There
was
nothing
he
could
not
face
.
He
was
so
*NL*
pleased
with
the
idea
that
he
smiled
,
keeping
perfunctorily
his
eyes
*NL*
ahead
;
and
when
he
happened
to
glance
back
he
saw
the
white
streak
of
*NL*
the
wake
drawn
as
straight
by
the
ship
's
keel
upon
the
sea
as
the
black
*NL*
line
drawn
by
the
pencil
upon
the
chart
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ash-buckets
racketed
,
clanking
up
and
down
the
stoke-hold
*NL*
ventilators
,
and
this
tin-pot
clatter
warned
him
the
end
of
his
watch
*NL*
was
near
.
He
sighed
with
content
,
with
regret
as
well
at
having
to
*NL*
part
from
that
serenity
which
fostered
the
adventurous
freedom
of
his
*NL*
thoughts
.
He
was
a
little
sleepy
too
,
and
felt
a
pleasurable
languor
*NL*
running
through
every
limb
as
though
all
the
blood
in
his
body
had
*NL*
turned
to
warm
milk
.
His
skipper
had
come
up
noiselessly
,
in
pyjamas
and
*NL*
with
his
sleeping-jacket
flung
wide
open
.
Red
of
face
,
only
half
awake
,
*NL*
the
left
eye
partly
closed
,
the
right
staring
stupid
and
glassy
,
he
hung
*NL*
his
big
head
over
the
chart
and
scratched
his
ribs
sleepily
.
There
was
*NL*
something
obscene
in
the
sight
of
his
naked
flesh
.
His
bared
breast
*NL*
glistened
soft
and
greasy
as
though
he
had
sweated
out
his
fat
in
his
*NL*
sleep
.
He
pronounced
a
professional
remark
in
a
voice
harsh
and
dead
,
*NL*
resembling
the
rasping
sound
of
a
wood-file
on
the
edge
of
a
plank
;
the
*NL*
fold
of
his
double
chin
hung
like
a
bag
triced
up
close
under
the
hinge
*NL*
of
his
jaw
.
Jim
started
,
and
his
answer
was
full
of
deference
;
but
*NL*
the
odious
and
fleshy
figure
,
as
though
seen
for
the
first
time
in
a
*NL*
revealing
moment
,
fixed
itself
in
his
memory
for
ever
as
the
incarnation
*NL*
of
everything
vile
and
base
that
lurks
in
the
world
we
love
:
in
our
own
*NL*
hearts
we
trust
for
our
salvation
,
in
the
men
that
surround
us
,
in
the
*NL*
sights
that
fill
our
eyes
,
in
the
sounds
that
fill
our
ears
,
and
in
the
*NL*
air
that
fills
our
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thin
gold
shaving
of
the
moon
floating
slowly
downwards
had
lost
*NL*
itself
on
the
darkened
surface
of
the
waters
,
and
the
eternity
beyond
*NL*
the
sky
seemed
to
come
down
nearer
to
the
earth
,
with
the
augmented
*NL*
glitter
of
the
stars
,
with
the
more
profound
sombreness
in
the
lustre
of
*NL*
the
half-transparent
dome
covering
the
flat
disc
of
an
opaque
sea
.
The
*NL*
ship
moved
so
smoothly
that
her
onward
motion
was
imperceptible
to
the
*NL*
senses
of
men
,
as
though
she
had
been
a
crowded
planet
speeding
through
*NL*
the
dark
spaces
of
ether
behind
the
swarm
of
suns
,
in
the
appalling
and
*NL*
calm
solitudes
awaiting
the
breath
of
future
creations
.
`
Hot
is
no
name
*NL*
for
it
down
below
,
'
said
a
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
smiled
without
looking
round
.
The
skipper
presented
an
unmoved
*NL*
breadth
of
back
:
it
was
the
renegade
's
trick
to
appear
pointedly
unaware
*NL*
of
your
existence
unless
it
suited
his
purpose
to
turn
at
you
with
a
*NL*
devouring
glare
before
he
let
loose
a
torrent
of
foamy
,
abusive
jargon
*NL*
that
came
like
a
gush
from
a
sewer
.
Now
he
emitted
only
a
sulky
grunt
;
*NL*
the
second
engineer
at
the
head
of
the
bridge-ladder
,
kneading
with
*NL*
damp
palms
a
dirty
sweat-rag
,
unabashed
,
continued
the
tale
of
his
*NL*
complaints
.
The
sailors
had
a
good
time
of
it
up
here
,
and
what
was
the
*NL*
use
of
them
in
the
world
he
would
be
blowed
if
he
could
see
.
The
poor
*NL*
devils
of
engineers
had
to
get
the
ship
along
anyhow
,
and
they
could
*NL*
very
well
do
the
rest
too
;
by
gosh
they
--
`
Shut
up
!
'
growled
the
German
*NL*
stolidly
.
`
Oh
yes
!
Shut
up
--
and
when
anything
goes
wrong
you
fly
to
*NL*
us
,
do
n't
you
?
'
went
on
the
other
.
He
was
more
than
half
cooked
,
he
*NL*
expected
;
but
anyway
,
now
,
he
did
not
mind
how
much
he
sinned
,
because
*NL*
these
last
three
days
he
had
passed
through
a
fine
course
of
training
*NL*
for
the
place
where
the
bad
boys
go
when
they
die
--
b
`
gosh
,
he
*NL*
had
--
besides
being
made
jolly
well
deaf
by
the
blasted
racket
below
.
*NL*
The
durned
,
compound
,
surface-condensing
,
rotten
scrap-heap
rattled
and
*NL*
banged
down
there
like
an
old
deck-winch
,
only
more
so
;
and
what
made
*NL*
him
risk
his
life
every
night
and
day
that
God
made
amongst
the
refuse
*NL*
of
a
breaking-up
yard
flying
round
at
fifty-seven
revolutions
,
was
more
*NL*
than
_
he
_
could
tell
.
He
must
have
been
born
reckless
,
b
`
gosh
.
*NL*
He
...
`
Where
did
you
get
drink
?
'
inquired
the
German
,
very
savage
;
but
*NL*
motionless
in
the
light
of
the
binnacle
,
like
a
clumsy
effigy
of
a
*NL*
man
cut
out
of
a
block
of
fat
.
Jim
went
on
smiling
at
the
retreating
*NL*
horizon
;
his
heart
was
full
of
generous
impulses
,
and
his
thought
was
*NL*
contemplating
his
own
superiority
.
`
Drink
!
'
repeated
the
engineer
with
*NL*
amiable
scorn
:
he
was
hanging
on
with
both
hands
to
the
rail
,
a
shadowy
*NL*
figure
with
flexible
legs
.
`
Not
from
you
,
captain
.
You
're
far
too
mean
,
*NL*
b
`
gosh
.
You
would
let
a
good
man
die
sooner
than
give
him
a
drop
of
*NL*
schnapps
.
That
's
what
you
Germans
call
economy
.
Penny
wise
,
pound
*NL*
foolish
.
'
He
became
sentimental
.
The
chief
had
given
him
a
four-finger
*NL*
nip
about
ten
o'clock
--
`
only
one
,
s
`
elp
me
!
'
--
good
old
chief
;
but
as
to
*NL*
getting
the
old
fraud
out
of
his
bunk
--
a
five-ton
crane
could
n't
do
*NL*
it
.
Not
it
.
Not
to-night
anyhow
.
He
was
sleeping
sweetly
like
a
little
*NL*
child
,
with
a
bottle
of
prime
brandy
under
his
pillow
.
From
the
thick
*NL*
throat
of
the
commander
of
the
Patna
came
a
low
rumble
,
on
which
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
word
schwein
fluttered
high
and
low
like
a
capricious
*NL*
feather
in
a
faint
stir
of
air
.
He
and
the
chief
engineer
had
been
*NL*
cronies
for
a
good
few
years
--
serving
the
same
jovial
,
crafty
,
old
*NL*
Chinaman
,
with
horn-rimmed
goggles
and
strings
of
red
silk
plaited
into
*NL*
the
venerable
grey
hairs
of
his
pigtail
.
The
quay-side
opinion
in
the
*NL*
Patna
's
home-port
was
that
these
two
in
the
way
of
brazen
peculation
*NL*
`
had
done
together
pretty
well
everything
you
can
think
of
.
'
Outwardly
*NL*
they
were
badly
matched
:
one
dull-eyed
,
malevolent
,
and
of
soft
fleshy
*NL*
curves
;
the
other
lean
,
all
hollows
,
with
a
head
long
and
bony
like
the
*NL*
head
of
an
old
horse
,
with
sunken
cheeks
,
with
sunken
temples
,
with
an
*NL*
indifferent
glazed
glance
of
sunken
eyes
.
He
had
been
stranded
out
East
*NL*
somewhere
--
in
Canton
,
in
Shanghai
,
or
perhaps
in
Yokohama
;
he
probably
*NL*
did
not
care
to
remember
himself
the
exact
locality
,
nor
yet
the
cause
*NL*
of
his
shipwreck
.
He
had
been
,
in
mercy
to
his
youth
,
kicked
quietly
*NL*
out
of
his
ship
twenty
years
ago
or
more
,
and
it
might
have
been
so
much
*NL*
worse
for
him
that
the
memory
of
the
episode
had
in
it
hardly
a
trace
*NL*
of
misfortune
.
Then
,
steam
navigation
expanding
in
these
seas
and
men
*NL*
of
his
craft
being
scarce
at
first
,
he
had
`
got
on
'
after
a
sort
.
He
*NL*
was
eager
to
let
strangers
know
in
a
dismal
mumble
that
he
was
`
an
old
*NL*
stager
out
here
.
'
When
he
moved
,
a
skeleton
seemed
to
sway
loose
in
his
*NL*
clothes
;
his
walk
was
mere
wandering
,
and
he
was
given
to
wander
thus
*NL*
around
the
engine-room
skylight
,
smoking
,
without
relish
,
doctored
*NL*
tobacco
in
a
brass
bowl
at
the
end
of
a
cherrywood
stem
four
feet
long
,
*NL*
with
the
imbecile
gravity
of
a
thinker
evolving
a
system
of
philosophy
*NL*
from
the
hazy
glimpse
of
a
truth
.
He
was
usually
anything
but
free
with
*NL*
his
private
store
of
liquor
;
but
on
that
night
he
had
departed
from
his
*NL*
principles
,
so
that
his
second
,
a
weak-headed
child
of
Wapping
,
what
*NL*
with
the
unexpectedness
of
the
treat
and
the
strength
of
the
stuff
,
*NL*
had
become
very
happy
,
cheeky
,
and
talkative
.
The
fury
of
the
New
South
*NL*
Wales
German
was
extreme
;
he
puffed
like
an
exhaust-pipe
,
and
Jim
,
*NL*
faintly
amused
by
the
scene
,
was
impatient
for
the
time
when
he
could
*NL*
get
below
:
the
last
ten
minutes
of
the
watch
were
irritating
like
a
*NL*
gun
that
hangs
fire
;
those
men
did
not
belong
to
the
world
of
heroic
*NL*
adventure
;
they
were
n't
bad
chaps
though
.
Even
the
skipper
himself
...
*NL*
His
gorge
rose
at
the
mass
of
panting
flesh
from
which
issued
*NL*
gurgling
mutters
,
a
cloudy
trickle
of
filthy
expressions
;
but
he
was
*NL*
too
pleasurably
languid
to
dislike
actively
this
or
any
other
thing
.
The
*NL*
quality
of
these
men
did
not
matter
;
he
rubbed
shoulders
with
them
,
but
*NL*
they
could
not
touch
him
;
he
shared
the
air
they
breathed
,
but
he
was
*NL*
different
...
Would
the
skipper
go
for
the
engineer
?
...
The
life
*NL*
was
easy
and
he
was
too
sure
of
himself
--
too
sure
of
himself
to
...
*NL*
The
line
dividing
his
meditation
from
a
surreptitious
doze
on
his
feet
*NL*
was
thinner
than
a
thread
in
a
spider
's
web
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
engineer
was
coming
by
easy
transitions
to
the
consideration
*NL*
of
his
finances
and
of
his
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
's
drunk
?
I
?
No
,
no
,
captain
!
That
wo
n't
do
.
You
ought
to
know
by
*NL*
this
time
the
chief
ai
n't
free-hearted
enough
to
make
a
sparrow
drunk
,
*NL*
b
`
gosh
.
I
've
never
been
the
worse
for
liquor
in
my
life
;
the
stuff
ai
n't
*NL*
made
yet
that
would
make
_
me
_
drunk
.
I
could
drink
liquid
fire
against
*NL*
your
whisky
peg
for
peg
,
b
`
gosh
,
and
keep
as
cool
as
a
cucumber
.
If
I
*NL*
thought
I
was
drunk
I
would
jump
overboard
--
do
away
with
myself
,
b
`
gosh
.
*NL*
I
would
!
Straight
!
And
I
wo
n't
go
off
the
bridge
.
Where
do
you
expect
*NL*
me
to
take
the
air
on
a
night
like
this
,
eh
?
On
deck
amongst
that
vermin
*NL*
down
there
?
Likely
--
ai
n't
it
!
And
I
am
not
afraid
of
anything
you
can
*NL*
do
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
The
German
lifted
two
heavy
fists
to
heaven
and
shook
them
a
little
*NL*
without
a
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
fear
is
,
'
pursued
the
engineer
,
with
the
enthusiasm
*NL*
of
sincere
conviction
.
'
I
am
not
afraid
of
doing
all
the
bloomin
'
work
*NL*
in
this
rotten
hooker
,
b
`
gosh
!
And
a
jolly
good
thing
for
you
that
there
*NL*
are
some
of
us
about
the
world
that
are
n't
afraid
of
their
lives
,
or
*NL*
where
would
you
be
--
you
and
this
old
thing
here
with
her
plates
like
*NL*
brown
paper
--
brown
paper
,
s
`
elp
me
?
It
's
all
very
fine
for
you
--
you
*NL*
get
a
power
of
pieces
out
of
her
one
way
and
another
;
but
what
about
*NL*
me
--
what
do
I
get
?
A
measly
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
a
month
and
*NL*
find
yourself
.
I
wish
to
ask
you
respectfully
--
respectfully
,
mind
--
who
*NL*
would
n't
chuck
a
dratted
job
like
this
?
`
Tai
n't
safe
,
s
`
elp
me
,
it
*NL*
ai
n't
!
Only
I
am
one
of
them
fearless
fellows
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
let
go
the
rail
and
made
ample
gestures
as
if
demonstrating
in
*NL*
the
air
the
shape
and
extent
of
his
valour
;
his
thin
voice
darted
in
*NL*
prolonged
squeaks
upon
the
sea
,
he
tiptoed
back
and
forth
for
the
better
*NL*
emphasis
of
utterance
,
and
suddenly
pitched
down
head-first
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
clubbed
from
behind
.
He
said
`
Damn
!
'
as
he
tumbled
;
an
instant
*NL*
of
silence
followed
upon
his
screeching
:
Jim
and
the
skipper
staggered
*NL*
forward
by
common
accord
,
and
catching
themselves
up
,
stood
very
stiff
*NL*
and
still
gazing
,
amazed
,
at
the
undisturbed
level
of
the
sea
.
Then
they
*NL*
looked
upwards
at
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
had
happened
?
The
wheezy
thump
of
the
engines
went
on
.
Had
the
*NL*
earth
been
checked
in
her
course
?
They
could
not
understand
;
and
*NL*
suddenly
the
calm
sea
,
the
sky
without
a
cloud
,
appeared
formidably
*NL*
insecure
in
their
immobility
,
as
if
poised
on
the
brow
of
yawning
*NL*
destruction
.
The
engineer
rebounded
vertically
full
length
and
collapsed
*NL*
again
into
a
vague
heap
.
This
heap
said
`
What
's
that
?
'
in
the
muffled
*NL*
accents
of
profound
grief
.
A
faint
noise
as
of
thunder
,
of
thunder
*NL*
infinitely
remote
,
less
than
a
sound
,
hardly
more
than
a
vibration
,
*NL*
passed
slowly
,
and
the
ship
quivered
in
response
,
as
if
the
thunder
had
*NL*
growled
deep
down
in
the
water
.
The
eyes
of
the
two
Malays
at
the
wheel
*NL*
glittered
towards
the
white
men
,
but
their
dark
hands
remained
closed
*NL*
on
the
spokes
.
The
sharp
hull
driving
on
its
way
seemed
to
rise
a
few
*NL*
inches
in
succession
through
its
whole
length
,
as
though
it
had
become
*NL*
pliable
,
and
settled
down
again
rigidly
to
its
work
of
cleaving
the
*NL*
smooth
surface
of
the
sea
.
Its
quivering
stopped
,
and
the
faint
noise
*NL*
of
thunder
ceased
all
at
once
,
as
though
the
ship
had
steamed
across
a
*NL*
narrow
belt
of
vibrating
water
and
of
humming
air

CHAPTER
4
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
or
so
afterwards
,
when
Jim
,
in
answer
to
pointed
questions
,
*NL*
tried
to
tell
honestly
the
truth
of
this
experience
,
he
said
,
speaking
*NL*
of
the
ship
:
`
She
went
over
whatever
it
was
as
easy
as
a
snake
crawling
*NL*
over
a
stick
.
'
The
illustration
was
good
:
the
questions
were
aiming
at
*NL*
facts
,
and
the
official
Inquiry
was
being
held
in
the
police
court
of
an
*NL*
Eastern
port
.
He
stood
elevated
in
the
witness-box
,
with
burning
cheeks
*NL*
in
a
cool
lofty
room
:
the
big
framework
of
punkahs
moved
gently
to
and
*NL*
fro
high
above
his
head
,
and
from
below
many
eyes
were
looking
at
him
*NL*
out
of
dark
faces
,
out
of
white
faces
,
out
of
red
faces
,
out
of
faces
*NL*
attentive
,
spellbound
,
as
if
all
these
people
sitting
in
orderly
rows
*NL*
upon
narrow
benches
had
been
enslaved
by
the
fascination
of
his
voice
.
*NL*
It
was
very
loud
,
it
rang
startling
in
his
own
ears
,
it
was
the
only
*NL*
sound
audible
in
the
world
,
for
the
terribly
distinct
questions
that
*NL*
extorted
his
answers
seemed
to
shape
themselves
in
anguish
and
pain
*NL*
within
his
breast
,
--
came
to
him
poignant
and
silent
like
the
*NL*
terrible
questioning
of
one
's
conscience
.
Outside
the
court
the
sun
*NL*
blazed
--
within
was
the
wind
of
great
punkahs
that
made
you
shiver
,
the
*NL*
shame
that
made
you
burn
,
the
attentive
eyes
whose
glance
stabbed
.
The
*NL*
face
of
the
presiding
magistrate
,
clean
shaved
and
impassible
,
looked
at
*NL*
him
deadly
pale
between
the
red
faces
of
the
two
nautical
assessors
.
The
*NL*
light
of
a
broad
window
under
the
ceiling
fell
from
above
on
the
heads
*NL*
and
shoulders
of
the
three
men
,
and
they
were
fiercely
distinct
in
the
*NL*
half-light
of
the
big
court-room
where
the
audience
seemed
composed
of
*NL*
staring
shadows
.
They
wanted
facts
.
Facts
!
They
demanded
facts
from
him
,
*NL*
as
if
facts
could
explain
anything
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
you
had
concluded
you
had
collided
with
something
floating
awash
,
*NL*
say
a
water-logged
wreck
,
you
were
ordered
by
your
captain
to
go
forward
*NL*
and
ascertain
if
there
was
any
damage
done
.
Did
you
think
it
likely
from
*NL*
the
force
of
the
blow
?
'
asked
the
assessor
sitting
to
the
left
.
He
had
*NL*
a
thin
horseshoe
beard
,
salient
cheek-bones
,
and
with
both
elbows
on
*NL*
the
desk
clasped
his
rugged
hands
before
his
face
,
looking
at
Jim
with
*NL*
thoughtful
blue
eyes
;
the
other
,
a
heavy
,
scornful
man
,
thrown
back
in
*NL*
his
seat
,
his
left
arm
extended
full
length
,
drummed
delicately
with
his
*NL*
finger-tips
on
a
blotting-pad
:
in
the
middle
the
magistrate
upright
in
*NL*
the
roomy
arm-chair
,
his
head
inclined
slightly
on
the
shoulder
,
had
his
*NL*
arms
crossed
on
his
breast
and
a
few
flowers
in
a
glass
vase
by
the
side
*NL*
of
his
inkstand
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
,
'
said
Jim
.
'
I
was
told
to
call
no
one
and
to
make
no
noise
*NL*
for
fear
of
creating
a
panic
.
I
thought
the
precaution
reasonable
.
I
*NL*
took
one
of
the
lamps
that
were
hung
under
the
awnings
and
went
forward
.
*NL*
After
opening
the
forepeak
hatch
I
heard
splashing
in
there
.
I
lowered
*NL*
then
the
lamp
the
whole
drift
of
its
lanyard
,
and
saw
that
the
forepeak
*NL*
was
more
than
half
full
of
water
already
.
I
knew
then
there
must
be
a
*NL*
big
hole
below
the
water-line
.
'
He
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yes
,
'
said
the
big
assessor
,
with
a
dreamy
smile
at
the
blotting-pad
;
*NL*
his
fingers
played
incessantly
,
touching
the
paper
without
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
think
of
danger
just
then
.
I
might
have
been
a
little
*NL*
startled
:
all
this
happened
in
such
a
quiet
way
and
so
very
suddenly
.
I
*NL*
knew
there
was
no
other
bulkhead
in
the
ship
but
the
collision
bulkhead
*NL*
separating
the
forepeak
from
the
forehold
.
I
went
back
to
tell
the
*NL*
captain
.
I
came
upon
the
second
engineer
getting
up
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
bridge-ladder
:
he
seemed
dazed
,
and
told
me
he
thought
his
left
arm
was
*NL*
broken
;
he
had
slipped
on
the
top
step
when
getting
down
while
I
was
*NL*
forward
.
He
exclaimed
,
``
My
God
!
That
rotten
bulkhead
'll
give
way
in
a
*NL*
minute
,
and
the
damned
thing
will
go
down
under
us
like
a
lump
of
lead
.
''
*NL*
He
pushed
me
away
with
his
right
arm
and
ran
before
me
up
the
ladder
,
*NL*
shouting
as
he
climbed
.
His
left
arm
hung
by
his
side
.
I
followed
up
in
*NL*
time
to
see
the
captain
rush
at
him
and
knock
him
down
flat
on
his
back
.
*NL*
He
did
not
strike
him
again
:
he
stood
bending
over
him
and
speaking
*NL*
angrily
but
quite
low
.
I
fancy
he
was
asking
him
why
the
devil
he
did
n't
*NL*
go
and
stop
the
engines
,
instead
of
making
a
row
about
it
on
deck
.
I
*NL*
heard
him
say
,
``
Get
up
!
Run
!
fly
!
''
He
swore
also
.
The
engineer
slid
down
*NL*
the
starboard
ladder
and
bolted
round
the
skylight
to
the
engine-room
*NL*
companion
which
was
on
the
port
side
.
He
moaned
as
he
ran
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
slowly
;
he
remembered
swiftly
and
with
extreme
vividness
;
he
*NL*
could
have
reproduced
like
an
echo
the
moaning
of
the
engineer
for
*NL*
the
better
information
of
these
men
who
wanted
facts
.
After
his
first
*NL*
feeling
of
revolt
he
had
come
round
to
the
view
that
only
a
meticulous
*NL*
precision
of
statement
would
bring
out
the
true
horror
behind
the
*NL*
appalling
face
of
things
.
The
facts
those
men
were
so
eager
to
know
had
*NL*
been
visible
,
tangible
,
open
to
the
senses
,
occupying
their
place
in
*NL*
space
and
time
,
requiring
for
their
existence
a
fourteen-hundred-ton
*NL*
steamer
and
twenty-seven
minutes
by
the
watch
;
they
made
a
whole
that
*NL*
had
features
,
shades
of
expression
,
a
complicated
aspect
that
could
be
*NL*
remembered
by
the
eye
,
and
something
else
besides
,
something
invisible
,
*NL*
a
directing
spirit
of
perdition
that
dwelt
within
,
like
a
malevolent
*NL*
soul
in
a
detestable
body
.
He
was
anxious
to
make
this
clear
.
This
*NL*
had
not
been
a
common
affair
,
everything
in
it
had
been
of
the
utmost
*NL*
importance
,
and
fortunately
he
remembered
everything
.
He
wanted
to
go
on
*NL*
talking
for
truth
's
sake
,
perhaps
for
his
own
sake
also
;
and
while
his
*NL*
utterance
was
deliberate
,
his
mind
positively
flew
round
and
round
the
*NL*
serried
circle
of
facts
that
had
surged
up
all
about
him
to
cut
him
off
*NL*
from
the
rest
of
his
kind
:
it
was
like
a
creature
that
,
finding
itself
*NL*
imprisoned
within
an
enclosure
of
high
stakes
,
dashes
round
and
round
,
*NL*
distracted
in
the
night
,
trying
to
find
a
weak
spot
,
a
crevice
,
a
place
*NL*
to
scale
,
some
opening
through
which
it
may
squeeze
itself
and
escape
.
*NL*
This
awful
activity
of
mind
made
him
hesitate
at
times
in
his
*NL*
speech
...
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
captain
kept
on
moving
here
and
there
on
the
bridge
;
he
seemed
calm
*NL*
enough
,
only
he
stumbled
several
times
;
and
once
as
I
stood
speaking
to
*NL*
him
he
walked
right
into
me
as
though
he
had
been
stone-blind
.
He
made
*NL*
no
definite
answer
to
what
I
had
to
tell
.
He
mumbled
to
himself
;
all
I
*NL*
heard
of
it
were
a
few
words
that
sounded
like
``
confounded
steam
!
''
and
*NL*
``
infernal
steam
!
''
--
something
about
steam
.
I
thought
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
becoming
irrelevant
;
a
question
to
the
point
cut
short
his
*NL*
speech
,
like
a
pang
of
pain
,
and
he
felt
extremely
discouraged
and
*NL*
weary
.
He
was
coming
to
that
,
he
was
coming
to
that
--
and
now
,
checked
*NL*
brutally
,
he
had
to
answer
by
yes
or
no
.
He
answered
truthfully
by
a
*NL*
curt
`
Yes
,
I
did
'
;
and
fair
of
face
,
big
of
frame
,
with
young
,
gloomy
*NL*
eyes
,
he
held
his
shoulders
upright
above
the
box
while
his
soul
writhed
*NL*
within
him
.
He
was
made
to
answer
another
question
so
much
to
the
point
*NL*
and
so
useless
,
then
waited
again
.
His
mouth
was
tastelessly
dry
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
been
eating
dust
,
then
salt
and
bitter
as
after
a
drink
*NL*
of
sea-water
.
He
wiped
his
damp
forehead
,
passed
his
tongue
over
parched
*NL*
lips
,
felt
a
shiver
run
down
his
back
.
The
big
assessor
had
dropped
his
*NL*
eyelids
,
and
drummed
on
without
a
sound
,
careless
and
mournful
;
the
eyes
*NL*
of
the
other
above
the
sunburnt
,
clasped
fingers
seemed
to
glow
with
*NL*
kindliness
;
the
magistrate
had
swayed
forward
;
his
pale
face
hovered
*NL*
near
the
flowers
,
and
then
dropping
sideways
over
the
arm
of
his
chair
,
*NL*
he
rested
his
temple
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
.
The
wind
of
the
punkahs
*NL*
eddied
down
on
the
heads
,
on
the
dark-faced
natives
wound
about
in
*NL*
voluminous
draperies
,
on
the
Europeans
sitting
together
very
hot
and
in
*NL*
drill
suits
that
seemed
to
fit
them
as
close
as
their
skins
,
and
holding
*NL*
their
round
pith
hats
on
their
knees
;
while
gliding
along
the
walls
the
*NL*
court
peons
,
buttoned
tight
in
long
white
coats
,
flitted
rapidly
to
and
*NL*
fro
,
running
on
bare
toes
,
red-sashed
,
red
turban
on
head
,
as
noiseless
*NL*
as
ghosts
,
and
on
the
alert
like
so
many
retrievers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jim
's
eyes
,
wandering
in
the
intervals
of
his
answers
,
rested
upon
a
*NL*
white
man
who
sat
apart
from
the
others
,
with
his
face
worn
and
clouded
,
*NL*
but
with
quiet
eyes
that
glanced
straight
,
interested
and
clear
.
Jim
*NL*
answered
another
question
and
was
tempted
to
cry
out
,
`
What
's
the
good
*NL*
of
this
!
what
's
the
good
!
'
He
tapped
with
his
foot
slightly
,
bit
his
*NL*
lip
,
and
looked
away
over
the
heads
.
He
met
the
eyes
of
the
white
man
.
*NL*
The
glance
directed
at
him
was
not
the
fascinated
stare
of
the
others
.
*NL*
It
was
an
act
of
intelligent
volition
.
Jim
between
two
questions
forgot
*NL*
himself
so
far
as
to
find
leisure
for
a
thought
.
This
fellow
--
ran
the
*NL*
thought
--
looks
at
me
as
though
he
could
see
somebody
or
something
past
*NL*
my
shoulder
.
He
had
come
across
that
man
before
--
in
the
street
perhaps
.
*NL*
He
was
positive
he
had
never
spoken
to
him
.
For
days
,
for
many
days
,
*NL*
he
had
spoken
to
no
one
,
but
had
held
silent
,
incoherent
,
and
endless
*NL*
converse
with
himself
,
like
a
prisoner
alone
in
his
cell
or
like
a
*NL*
wayfarer
lost
in
a
wilderness
.
At
present
he
was
answering
questions
*NL*
that
did
not
matter
though
they
had
a
purpose
,
but
he
doubted
whether
*NL*
he
would
ever
again
speak
out
as
long
as
he
lived
.
The
sound
of
his
own
*NL*
truthful
statements
confirmed
his
deliberate
opinion
that
speech
was
*NL*
of
no
use
to
him
any
longer
.
That
man
there
seemed
to
be
aware
of
his
*NL*
hopeless
difficulty
.
Jim
looked
at
him
,
then
turned
away
resolutely
,
as
*NL*
after
a
final
parting
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
later
on
,
many
times
,
in
distant
parts
of
the
world
,
Marlow
showed
*NL*
himself
willing
to
remember
Jim
,
to
remember
him
at
length
,
in
detail
*NL*
and
audibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
it
would
be
after
dinner
,
on
a
verandah
draped
in
motionless
*NL*
foliage
and
crowned
with
flowers
,
in
the
deep
dusk
speckled
by
fiery
*NL*
cigar-ends
.
The
elongated
bulk
of
each
cane-chair
harboured
a
silent
*NL*
listener
.
Now
and
then
a
small
red
glow
would
move
abruptly
,
and
*NL*
expanding
light
up
the
fingers
of
a
languid
hand
,
part
of
a
face
in
*NL*
profound
repose
,
or
flash
a
crimson
gleam
into
a
pair
of
pensive
eyes
*NL*
overshadowed
by
a
fragment
of
an
unruffled
forehead
;
and
with
the
very
*NL*
first
word
uttered
Marlow
's
body
,
extended
at
rest
in
the
seat
,
would
*NL*
become
very
still
,
as
though
his
spirit
had
winged
its
way
back
into
the
*NL*
lapse
of
time
and
were
speaking
through
his
lips
from
the
past
.

CHAPTER
5
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Oh
yes
.
I
attended
the
inquiry
,
'
he
would
say
,
`
and
to
this
day
I
*NL*
have
n't
left
off
wondering
why
I
went
.
I
am
willing
to
believe
each
of
*NL*
us
has
a
guardian
angel
,
if
you
fellows
will
concede
to
me
that
each
of
*NL*
us
has
a
familiar
devil
as
well
.
I
want
you
to
own
up
,
because
I
do
n't
*NL*
like
to
feel
exceptional
in
any
way
,
and
I
know
I
have
him
--
the
devil
,
*NL*
I
mean
.
I
have
n't
seen
him
,
of
course
,
but
I
go
upon
circumstantial
*NL*
evidence
.
He
is
there
right
enough
,
and
,
being
malicious
,
he
lets
me
in
*NL*
for
that
kind
of
thing
.
What
kind
of
thing
,
you
ask
?
Why
,
the
inquiry
*NL*
thing
,
the
yellow-dog
thing
--
you
would
n't
think
a
mangy
,
native
tyke
*NL*
would
be
allowed
to
trip
up
people
in
the
verandah
of
a
magistrate
's
*NL*
court
,
would
you
?
--
the
kind
of
thing
that
by
devious
,
unexpected
,
truly
*NL*
diabolical
ways
causes
me
to
run
up
against
men
with
soft
spots
,
with
*NL*
hard
spots
,
with
hidden
plague
spots
,
by
Jove
!
and
loosens
their
tongues
*NL*
at
the
sight
of
me
for
their
infernal
confidences
;
as
though
,
forsooth
,
*NL*
I
had
no
confidences
to
make
to
myself
,
as
though
--
God
help
me
!
--
I
*NL*
did
n't
have
enough
confidential
information
about
myself
to
harrow
my
*NL*
own
soul
till
the
end
of
my
appointed
time
.
And
what
I
have
done
to
be
*NL*
thus
favoured
I
want
to
know
.
I
declare
I
am
as
full
of
my
own
concerns
*NL*
as
the
next
man
,
and
I
have
as
much
memory
as
the
average
pilgrim
in
*NL*
this
valley
,
so
you
see
I
am
not
particularly
fit
to
be
a
receptacle
of
*NL*
confessions
.
Then
why
?
Ca
n't
tell
--
unless
it
be
to
make
time
pass
away
*NL*
after
dinner
.
Charley
,
my
dear
chap
,
your
dinner
was
extremely
good
,
and
*NL*
in
consequence
these
men
here
look
upon
a
quiet
rubber
as
a
tumultuous
*NL*
occupation
.
They
wallow
in
your
good
chairs
and
think
to
themselves
,
*NL*
``
Hang
exertion
.
Let
that
Marlow
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Talk
?
So
be
it
.
And
it
's
easy
enough
to
talk
of
Master
Jim
,
after
a
*NL*
good
spread
,
two
hundred
feet
above
the
sea-level
,
with
a
box
of
decent
*NL*
cigars
handy
,
on
a
blessed
evening
of
freshness
and
starlight
that
would
*NL*
make
the
best
of
us
forget
we
are
only
on
sufferance
here
and
got
to
*NL*
pick
our
way
in
cross
lights
,
watching
every
precious
minute
and
every
*NL*
irremediable
step
,
trusting
we
shall
manage
yet
to
go
out
decently
in
*NL*
the
end
--
but
not
so
sure
of
it
after
all
--
and
with
dashed
little
help
to
*NL*
expect
from
those
we
touch
elbows
with
right
and
left
.
Of
course
there
*NL*
are
men
here
and
there
to
whom
the
whole
of
life
is
like
an
after-dinner
*NL*
hour
with
a
cigar
;
easy
,
pleasant
,
empty
,
perhaps
enlivened
by
some
*NL*
fable
of
strife
to
be
forgotten
before
the
end
is
told
--
before
the
end
*NL*
is
told
--
even
if
there
happens
to
be
any
end
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
eyes
met
his
for
the
first
time
at
that
inquiry
.
You
must
know
*NL*
that
everybody
connected
in
any
way
with
the
sea
was
there
,
because
the
*NL*
affair
had
been
notorious
for
days
,
ever
since
that
mysterious
cable
*NL*
message
came
from
Aden
to
start
us
all
cackling
.
I
say
mysterious
,
*NL*
because
it
was
so
in
a
sense
though
it
contained
a
naked
fact
,
about
*NL*
as
naked
and
ugly
as
a
fact
can
well
be
.
The
whole
waterside
talked
*NL*
of
nothing
else
.
First
thing
in
the
morning
as
I
was
dressing
in
my
*NL*
state-room
,
I
would
hear
through
the
bulkhead
my
Parsee
Dubash
jabbering
*NL*
about
the
Patna
with
the
steward
,
while
he
drank
a
cup
of
tea
,
*NL*
by
favour
,
in
the
pantry
.
No
sooner
on
shore
I
would
meet
some
*NL*
acquaintance
,
and
the
first
remark
would
be
,
``
Did
you
ever
hear
of
*NL*
anything
to
beat
this
?
''
and
according
to
his
kind
the
man
would
smile
*NL*
cynically
,
or
look
sad
,
or
let
out
a
swear
or
two
.
Complete
strangers
*NL*
would
accost
each
other
familiarly
,
just
for
the
sake
of
easing
their
*NL*
minds
on
the
subject
:
every
confounded
loafer
in
the
town
came
in
for
*NL*
a
harvest
of
drinks
over
this
affair
:
you
heard
of
it
in
the
harbour
*NL*
office
,
at
every
ship-broker
's
,
at
your
agent
's
,
from
whites
,
from
*NL*
natives
,
from
half-castes
,
from
the
very
boatmen
squatting
half
naked
on
*NL*
the
stone
steps
as
you
went
up
--
by
Jove
!
There
was
some
indignation
,
not
*NL*
a
few
jokes
,
and
no
end
of
discussions
as
to
what
had
become
of
them
,
*NL*
you
know
.
This
went
on
for
a
couple
of
weeks
or
more
,
and
the
opinion
*NL*
that
whatever
was
mysterious
in
this
affair
would
turn
out
to
be
tragic
*NL*
as
well
,
began
to
prevail
,
when
one
fine
morning
,
as
I
was
standing
*NL*
in
the
shade
by
the
steps
of
the
harbour
office
,
I
perceived
four
men
*NL*
walking
towards
me
along
the
quay
.
I
wondered
for
a
while
where
that
*NL*
queer
lot
had
sprung
from
,
and
suddenly
,
I
may
say
,
I
shouted
to
myself
,
*NL*
``
Here
they
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
they
were
,
sure
enough
,
three
of
them
as
large
as
life
,
and
one
*NL*
much
larger
of
girth
than
any
living
man
has
a
right
to
be
,
just
landed
*NL*
with
a
good
breakfast
inside
of
them
from
an
outward-bound
Dale
Line
*NL*
steamer
that
had
come
in
about
an
hour
after
sunrise
.
There
could
be
no
*NL*
mistake
;
I
spotted
the
jolly
skipper
of
the
Patna
at
the
first
glance
:
*NL*
the
fattest
man
in
the
whole
blessed
tropical
belt
clear
round
that
good
*NL*
old
earth
of
ours
.
Moreover
,
nine
months
or
so
before
,
I
had
come
*NL*
across
him
in
Samarang
.
His
steamer
was
loading
in
the
Roads
,
and
he
was
*NL*
abusing
the
tyrannical
institutions
of
the
German
empire
,
and
soaking
*NL*
himself
in
beer
all
day
long
and
day
after
day
in
De
Jongh
's
back-shop
,
*NL*
till
De
Jongh
,
who
charged
a
guilder
for
every
bottle
without
as
much
*NL*
as
the
quiver
of
an
eyelid
,
would
beckon
me
aside
,
and
,
with
his
little
*NL*
leathery
face
all
puckered
up
,
declare
confidentially
,
``
Business
is
*NL*
business
,
but
this
man
,
captain
,
he
make
me
very
sick
.
Tfui
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
looking
at
him
from
the
shade
.
He
was
hurrying
on
a
little
in
*NL*
advance
,
and
the
sunlight
beating
on
him
brought
out
his
bulk
in
a
*NL*
startling
way
.
He
made
me
think
of
a
trained
baby
elephant
walking
*NL*
on
hind-legs
.
He
was
extravagantly
gorgeous
too
--
got
up
in
a
soiled
*NL*
sleeping-suit
,
bright
green
and
deep
orange
vertical
stripes
,
with
a
*NL*
pair
of
ragged
straw
slippers
on
his
bare
feet
,
and
somebody
's
cast-off
*NL*
pith
hat
,
very
dirty
and
two
sizes
too
small
for
him
,
tied
up
with
a
*NL*
manilla
rope-yarn
on
the
top
of
his
big
head
.
You
understand
a
man
like
*NL*
that
has
n't
the
ghost
of
a
chance
when
it
comes
to
borrowing
clothes
.
*NL*
Very
well
.
On
he
came
in
hot
haste
,
without
a
look
right
or
left
,
passed
*NL*
within
three
feet
of
me
,
and
in
the
innocence
of
his
heart
went
on
*NL*
pelting
upstairs
into
the
harbour
office
to
make
his
deposition
,
or
*NL*
report
,
or
whatever
you
like
to
call
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
appears
he
addressed
himself
in
the
first
instance
to
the
principal
*NL*
shipping-master
.
Archie
Ruthvel
had
just
come
in
,
and
,
as
his
story
*NL*
goes
,
was
about
to
begin
his
arduous
day
by
giving
a
dressing-down
to
*NL*
his
chief
clerk
.
Some
of
you
might
have
known
him
--
an
obliging
little
*NL*
Portuguese
half-caste
with
a
miserably
skinny
neck
,
and
always
on
the
*NL*
hop
to
get
something
from
the
shipmasters
in
the
way
of
eatables
--
a
*NL*
piece
of
salt
pork
,
a
bag
of
biscuits
,
a
few
potatoes
,
or
what
not
.
One
*NL*
voyage
,
I
recollect
,
I
tipped
him
a
live
sheep
out
of
the
remnant
of
my
*NL*
sea-stock
:
not
that
I
wanted
him
to
do
anything
for
me
--
he
could
n't
,
*NL*
you
know
--
but
because
his
childlike
belief
in
the
sacred
right
to
*NL*
perquisites
quite
touched
my
heart
.
It
was
so
strong
as
to
be
almost
*NL*
beautiful
.
The
race
--
the
two
races
rather
--
and
the
climate
...
*NL*
However
,
never
mind
.
I
know
where
I
have
a
friend
for
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
,
Ruthvel
says
he
was
giving
him
a
severe
lecture
--
on
official
*NL*
morality
,
I
suppose
--
when
he
heard
a
kind
of
subdued
commotion
at
his
*NL*
back
,
and
turning
his
head
he
saw
,
in
his
own
words
,
something
round
and
*NL*
enormous
,
resembling
a
sixteen-hundred-weight
sugar-hogshead
wrapped
in
*NL*
striped
flannelette
,
up-ended
in
the
middle
of
the
large
floor
space
*NL*
in
the
office
.
He
declares
he
was
so
taken
aback
that
for
quite
an
*NL*
appreciable
time
he
did
not
realise
the
thing
was
alive
,
and
sat
still
*NL*
wondering
for
what
purpose
and
by
what
means
that
object
had
been
*NL*
transported
in
front
of
his
desk
.
The
archway
from
the
ante-room
was
*NL*
crowded
with
punkah-pullers
,
sweepers
,
police
peons
,
the
coxswain
and
*NL*
crew
of
the
harbour
steam-launch
,
all
craning
their
necks
and
almost
*NL*
climbing
on
each
other
's
backs
.
Quite
a
riot
.
By
that
time
the
fellow
*NL*
had
managed
to
tug
and
jerk
his
hat
clear
of
his
head
,
and
advanced
with
*NL*
slight
bows
at
Ruthvel
,
who
told
me
the
sight
was
so
discomposing
that
*NL*
for
some
time
he
listened
,
quite
unable
to
make
out
what
that
apparition
*NL*
wanted
.
It
spoke
in
a
voice
harsh
and
lugubrious
but
intrepid
,
and
*NL*
little
by
little
it
dawned
upon
Archie
that
this
was
a
development
of
*NL*
the
Patna
case
.
He
says
that
as
soon
as
he
understood
who
it
was
before
*NL*
him
he
felt
quite
unwell
--
Archie
is
so
sympathetic
and
easily
upset
--
but
*NL*
pulled
himself
together
and
shouted
``
Stop
!
I
ca
n't
listen
to
you
.
You
*NL*
must
go
to
the
Master
Attendant
.
I
ca
n't
possibly
listen
to
you
.
Captain
*NL*
Elliot
is
the
man
you
want
to
see
.
This
way
,
this
way
.
''
He
jumped
*NL*
up
,
ran
round
that
long
counter
,
pulled
,
shoved
:
the
other
let
him
,
*NL*
surprised
but
obedient
at
first
,
and
only
at
the
door
of
the
private
*NL*
office
some
sort
of
animal
instinct
made
him
hang
back
and
snort
like
*NL*
a
frightened
bullock
.
``
Look
here
!
what
's
up
?
Let
go
!
Look
here
!
''
Archie
*NL*
flung
open
the
door
without
knocking
.
``
The
master
of
the
Patna
,
sir
,
''
*NL*
he
shouts
.
``
Go
in
,
captain
.
''
He
saw
the
old
man
lift
his
head
from
some
*NL*
writing
so
sharp
that
his
nose-nippers
fell
off
,
banged
the
door
to
,
and
*NL*
fled
to
his
desk
,
where
he
had
some
papers
waiting
for
his
signature
:
*NL*
but
he
says
the
row
that
burst
out
in
there
was
so
awful
that
he
*NL*
could
n't
collect
his
senses
sufficiently
to
remember
the
spelling
of
*NL*
his
own
name
.
Archie
's
the
most
sensitive
shipping-master
in
the
two
*NL*
hemispheres
.
He
declares
he
felt
as
though
he
had
thrown
a
man
to
a
*NL*
hungry
lion
.
No
doubt
the
noise
was
great
.
I
heard
it
down
below
,
and
I
*NL*
have
every
reason
to
believe
it
was
heard
clear
across
the
Esplanade
as
*NL*
far
as
the
band-stand
.
Old
father
Elliot
had
a
great
stock
of
words
and
*NL*
could
shout
--
and
did
n't
mind
who
he
shouted
at
either
.
He
would
have
*NL*
shouted
at
the
Viceroy
himself
.
As
he
used
to
tell
me
:
``
I
am
as
high
as
*NL*
I
can
get
;
my
pension
is
safe
.
I
've
a
few
pounds
laid
by
,
and
if
they
*NL*
do
n't
like
my
notions
of
duty
I
would
just
as
soon
go
home
as
not
.
I
am
*NL*
an
old
man
,
and
I
have
always
spoken
my
mind
.
All
I
care
for
now
is
to
*NL*
see
my
girls
married
before
I
die
.
''
He
was
a
little
crazy
on
that
*NL*
point
.
His
three
daughters
were
awfully
nice
,
though
they
resembled
him
*NL*
amazingly
,
and
on
the
mornings
he
woke
up
with
a
gloomy
view
of
their
*NL*
matrimonial
prospects
the
office
would
read
it
in
his
eye
and
tremble
,
*NL*
because
,
they
said
,
he
was
sure
to
have
somebody
for
breakfast
.
However
,
*NL*
that
morning
he
did
not
eat
the
renegade
,
but
,
if
I
may
be
allowed
to
*NL*
carry
on
the
metaphor
,
chewed
him
up
very
small
,
so
to
speak
,
and
--
ah
!
*NL*
ejected
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
in
a
very
few
moments
I
saw
his
monstrous
bulk
descend
in
haste
*NL*
and
stand
still
on
the
outer
steps
.
He
had
stopped
close
to
me
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
profound
meditation
:
his
large
purple
cheeks
quivered
.
He
*NL*
was
biting
his
thumb
,
and
after
a
while
noticed
me
with
a
sidelong
vexed
*NL*
look
.
The
other
three
chaps
that
had
landed
with
him
made
a
little
group
*NL*
waiting
at
some
distance
.
There
was
a
sallow-faced
,
mean
little
chap
*NL*
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
and
a
long
individual
in
a
blue
flannel
coat
,
*NL*
as
dry
as
a
chip
and
no
stouter
than
a
broomstick
,
with
drooping
grey
*NL*
moustaches
,
who
looked
about
him
with
an
air
of
jaunty
imbecility
.
The
*NL*
third
was
an
upstanding
,
broad-shouldered
youth
,
with
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
pockets
,
turning
his
back
on
the
other
two
who
appeared
to
be
talking
*NL*
together
earnestly
.
He
stared
across
the
empty
Esplanade
.
A
ramshackle
*NL*
gharry
,
all
dust
and
venetian
blinds
,
pulled
up
short
opposite
the
*NL*
group
,
and
the
driver
,
throwing
up
his
right
foot
over
his
knee
,
gave
*NL*
himself
up
to
the
critical
examination
of
his
toes
.
The
young
chap
,
*NL*
making
no
movement
,
not
even
stirring
his
head
,
just
stared
into
the
*NL*
sunshine
.
This
was
my
first
view
of
Jim
.
He
looked
as
unconcerned
and
*NL*
unapproachable
as
only
the
young
can
look
.
There
he
stood
,
clean-limbed
,
*NL*
clean-faced
,
firm
on
his
feet
,
as
promising
a
boy
as
the
sun
ever
shone
*NL*
on
;
and
,
looking
at
him
,
knowing
all
he
knew
and
a
little
more
too
,
I
*NL*
was
as
angry
as
though
I
had
detected
him
trying
to
get
something
out
of
*NL*
me
by
false
pretences
.
He
had
no
business
to
look
so
sound
.
I
thought
*NL*
to
myself
--
well
,
if
this
sort
can
go
wrong
like
that
...
and
I
felt
*NL*
as
though
I
could
fling
down
my
hat
and
dance
on
it
from
sheer
*NL*
mortification
,
as
I
once
saw
the
skipper
of
an
Italian
barque
do
because
*NL*
his
duffer
of
a
mate
got
into
a
mess
with
his
anchors
when
making
a
*NL*
flying
moor
in
a
roadstead
full
of
ships
.
I
asked
myself
,
seeing
him
*NL*
there
apparently
so
much
at
ease
--
is
he
silly
?
is
he
callous
?
He
seemed
*NL*
ready
to
start
whistling
a
tune
.
And
note
,
I
did
not
care
a
rap
about
*NL*
the
behaviour
of
the
other
two
.
Their
persons
somehow
fitted
the
tale
*NL*
that
was
public
property
,
and
was
going
to
be
the
subject
of
an
official
*NL*
inquiry
.
``
That
old
mad
rogue
upstairs
called
me
a
hound
,
''
said
the
*NL*
captain
of
the
Patna
.
I
ca
n't
tell
whether
he
recognised
me
--
I
rather
*NL*
think
he
did
;
but
at
any
rate
our
glances
met
.
He
glared
--
I
smiled
;
*NL*
hound
was
the
very
mildest
epithet
that
had
reached
me
through
the
open
*NL*
window
.
``
Did
he
?
''
I
said
from
some
strange
inability
to
hold
my
tongue
.
*NL*
He
nodded
,
bit
his
thumb
again
,
swore
under
his
breath
:
then
lifting
his
*NL*
head
and
looking
at
me
with
sullen
and
passionate
impudence
--
``
Bah
!
the
*NL*
Pacific
is
big
,
my
friendt
.
You
damned
Englishmen
can
do
your
worst
;
I
*NL*
know
where
there
's
plenty
room
for
a
man
like
me
:
I
am
well
aguaindt
*NL*
in
Apia
,
in
Honolulu
,
in
...
''
He
paused
reflectively
,
while
without
*NL*
effort
I
could
depict
to
myself
the
sort
of
people
he
was
``
aguaindt
''
*NL*
with
in
those
places
.
I
wo
n't
make
a
secret
of
it
that
I
had
been
*NL*
``
aguaindt
''
with
not
a
few
of
that
sort
myself
.
There
are
times
when
*NL*
a
man
must
act
as
though
life
were
equally
sweet
in
any
company
.
I
've
*NL*
known
such
a
time
,
and
,
what
's
more
,
I
sha
n't
now
pretend
to
pull
a
long
*NL*
face
over
my
necessity
,
because
a
good
many
of
that
bad
company
from
*NL*
want
of
moral
--
moral
--
what
shall
I
say
?
--
posture
,
or
from
some
other
*NL*
equally
profound
cause
,
were
twice
as
instructive
and
twenty
times
more
*NL*
amusing
than
the
usual
respectable
thief
of
commerce
you
fellows
ask
*NL*
to
sit
at
your
table
without
any
real
necessity
--
from
habit
,
from
*NL*
cowardice
,
from
good-nature
,
from
a
hundred
sneaking
and
inadequate
*NL*
reasons
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
Englishmen
are
all
rogues
,
''
went
on
my
patriotic
Flensborg
or
*NL*
Stettin
Australian
.
I
really
do
n't
recollect
now
what
decent
little
*NL*
port
on
the
shores
of
the
Baltic
was
defiled
by
being
the
nest
of
that
*NL*
precious
bird
.
``
What
are
you
to
shout
?
Eh
?
You
tell
me
?
You
no
better
*NL*
than
other
people
,
and
that
old
rogue
he
make
Gottam
fuss
with
me
.
''
His
*NL*
thick
carcass
trembled
on
its
legs
that
were
like
a
pair
of
pillars
;
it
*NL*
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
``
That
's
what
you
English
always
make
--
make
*NL*
a
tam
'
fuss
--
for
any
little
thing
,
because
I
was
not
born
in
your
*NL*
tam
'
country
.
Take
away
my
certificate
.
Take
it
.
I
do
n't
want
the
*NL*
certificate
.
A
man
like
me
do
n't
want
your
verfluchte
certificate
.
I
*NL*
shpit
on
it
.
''
He
spat
.
``
I
vill
an
Amerigan
citizen
begome
,
''
he
cried
,
*NL*
fretting
and
fuming
and
shuffling
his
feet
as
if
to
free
his
ankles
from
*NL*
some
invisible
and
mysterious
grasp
that
would
not
let
him
get
away
*NL*
from
that
spot
.
He
made
himself
so
warm
that
the
top
of
his
bullet
head
*NL*
positively
smoked
.
Nothing
mysterious
prevented
me
from
going
away
:
*NL*
curiosity
is
the
most
obvious
of
sentiments
,
and
it
held
me
there
to
see
*NL*
the
effect
of
a
full
information
upon
that
young
fellow
who
,
hands
*NL*
in
pockets
,
and
turning
his
back
upon
the
sidewalk
,
gazed
across
the
*NL*
grass-plots
of
the
Esplanade
at
the
yellow
portico
of
the
Malabar
Hotel
*NL*
with
the
air
of
a
man
about
to
go
for
a
walk
as
soon
as
his
friend
is
*NL*
ready
.
That
's
how
he
looked
,
and
it
was
odious
.
I
waited
to
see
him
*NL*
overwhelmed
,
confounded
,
pierced
through
and
through
,
squirming
like
an
*NL*
impaled
beetle
--
and
I
was
half
afraid
to
see
it
too
--
if
you
understand
*NL*
what
I
mean
.
Nothing
more
awful
than
to
watch
a
man
who
has
been
found
*NL*
out
,
not
in
a
crime
but
in
a
more
than
criminal
weakness
.
The
commonest
*NL*
sort
of
fortitude
prevents
us
from
becoming
criminals
in
a
legal
sense
;
*NL*
it
is
from
weakness
unknown
,
but
perhaps
suspected
,
as
in
some
parts
of
*NL*
the
world
you
suspect
a
deadly
snake
in
every
bush
--
from
weakness
*NL*
that
may
lie
hidden
,
watched
or
unwatched
,
prayed
against
or
manfully
*NL*
scorned
,
repressed
or
maybe
ignored
more
than
half
a
lifetime
,
not
one
*NL*
of
us
is
safe
.
We
are
snared
into
doing
things
for
which
we
get
called
*NL*
names
,
and
things
for
which
we
get
hanged
,
and
yet
the
spirit
may
well
*NL*
survive
--
survive
the
condemnation
,
survive
the
halter
,
by
Jove
!
And
*NL*
there
are
things
--
they
look
small
enough
sometimes
too
--
by
which
some
of
*NL*
us
are
totally
and
completely
undone
.
I
watched
the
youngster
there
.
*NL*
I
liked
his
appearance
;
I
knew
his
appearance
;
he
came
from
the
right
*NL*
place
;
he
was
one
of
us
.
He
stood
there
for
all
the
parentage
of
his
*NL*
kind
,
for
men
and
women
by
no
means
clever
or
amusing
,
but
whose
very
*NL*
existence
is
based
upon
honest
faith
,
and
upon
the
instinct
of
courage
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
mean
military
courage
,
or
civil
courage
,
or
any
special
kind
of
*NL*
courage
.
I
mean
just
that
inborn
ability
to
look
temptations
straight
in
*NL*
the
face
--
a
readiness
unintellectual
enough
,
goodness
knows
,
but
without
*NL*
pose
--
a
power
of
resistance
,
do
n't
you
see
,
ungracious
if
you
like
,
but
*NL*
priceless
--
an
unthinking
and
blessed
stiffness
before
the
outward
and
*NL*
inward
terrors
,
before
the
might
of
nature
and
the
seductive
corruption
*NL*
of
men
--
backed
by
a
faith
invulnerable
to
the
strength
of
facts
,
to
the
*NL*
contagion
of
example
,
to
the
solicitation
of
ideas
.
Hang
ideas
!
They
are
*NL*
tramps
,
vagabonds
,
knocking
at
the
back-door
of
your
mind
,
each
taking
*NL*
a
little
of
your
substance
,
each
carrying
away
some
crumb
of
that
belief
*NL*
in
a
few
simple
notions
you
must
cling
to
if
you
want
to
live
decently
*NL*
and
would
like
to
die
easy
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
has
nothing
to
do
with
Jim
,
directly
;
only
he
was
outwardly
so
*NL*
typical
of
that
good
,
stupid
kind
we
like
to
feel
marching
right
and
*NL*
left
of
us
in
life
,
of
the
kind
that
is
not
disturbed
by
the
vagaries
of
*NL*
intelligence
and
the
perversions
of
--
of
nerves
,
let
us
say
.
He
was
the
*NL*
kind
of
fellow
you
would
,
on
the
strength
of
his
looks
,
leave
in
charge
*NL*
of
the
deck
--
figuratively
and
professionally
speaking
.
I
say
I
would
,
*NL*
and
I
ought
to
know
.
Have
n't
I
turned
out
youngsters
enough
in
my
time
,
*NL*
for
the
service
of
the
Red
Rag
,
to
the
craft
of
the
sea
,
to
the
craft
*NL*
whose
whole
secret
could
be
expressed
in
one
short
sentence
,
and
yet
*NL*
must
be
driven
afresh
every
day
into
young
heads
till
it
becomes
the
*NL*
component
part
of
every
waking
thought
--
till
it
is
present
in
every
*NL*
dream
of
their
young
sleep
!
The
sea
has
been
good
to
me
,
but
when
I
*NL*
remember
all
these
boys
that
passed
through
my
hands
,
some
grown
up
now
*NL*
and
some
drowned
by
this
time
,
but
all
good
stuff
for
the
sea
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
I
have
done
badly
by
it
either
.
Were
I
to
go
home
to-morrow
,
I
bet
*NL*
that
before
two
days
passed
over
my
head
some
sunburnt
young
chief
mate
*NL*
would
overtake
me
at
some
dock
gateway
or
other
,
and
a
fresh
deep
voice
*NL*
speaking
above
my
hat
would
ask
:
``
Do
n't
you
remember
me
,
sir
?
Why
!
*NL*
little
So-and-so
.
Such
and
such
a
ship
.
It
was
my
first
voyage
.
''
And
I
*NL*
would
remember
a
bewildered
little
shaver
,
no
higher
than
the
back
of
*NL*
this
chair
,
with
a
mother
and
perhaps
a
big
sister
on
the
quay
,
very
*NL*
quiet
but
too
upset
to
wave
their
handkerchiefs
at
the
ship
that
glides
*NL*
out
gently
between
the
pier-heads
;
or
perhaps
some
decent
middle-aged
*NL*
father
who
had
come
early
with
his
boy
to
see
him
off
,
and
stays
all
the
*NL*
morning
,
because
he
is
interested
in
the
windlass
apparently
,
and
stays
*NL*
too
long
,
and
has
got
to
scramble
ashore
at
last
with
no
time
at
all
*NL*
to
say
good-bye
.
The
mud
pilot
on
the
poop
sings
out
to
me
in
a
drawl
,
*NL*
``
Hold
her
with
the
check
line
for
a
moment
,
Mister
Mate
.
There
's
a
*NL*
gentleman
wants
to
get
ashore
...
Up
with
you
,
sir
.
Nearly
got
*NL*
carried
off
to
Talcahuano
,
did
n't
you
?
Now
's
your
time
;
easy
does
*NL*
it
...
All
right
.
Slack
away
again
forward
there
.
''
The
tugs
,
smoking
*NL*
like
the
pit
of
perdition
,
get
hold
and
churn
the
old
river
into
fury
;
*NL*
the
gentleman
ashore
is
dusting
his
knees
--
the
benevolent
steward
has
*NL*
shied
his
umbrella
after
him
.
All
very
proper
.
He
has
offered
his
bit
of
*NL*
sacrifice
to
the
sea
,
and
now
he
may
go
home
pretending
he
thinks
*NL*
nothing
of
it
;
and
the
little
willing
victim
shall
be
very
sea-sick
*NL*
before
next
morning
.
By-and-by
,
when
he
has
learned
all
the
little
*NL*
mysteries
and
the
one
great
secret
of
the
craft
,
he
shall
be
fit
to
live
*NL*
or
die
as
the
sea
may
decree
;
and
the
man
who
had
taken
a
hand
in
this
*NL*
fool
game
,
in
which
the
sea
wins
every
toss
,
will
be
pleased
to
have
his
*NL*
back
slapped
by
a
heavy
young
hand
,
and
to
hear
a
cheery
sea-puppy
*NL*
voice
:
``
Do
you
remember
me
,
sir
?
The
little
So-and-so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tell
you
this
is
good
;
it
tells
you
that
once
in
your
life
at
least
*NL*
you
had
gone
the
right
way
to
work
.
I
have
been
thus
slapped
,
and
I
have
*NL*
winced
,
for
the
slap
was
heavy
,
and
I
have
glowed
all
day
long
and
gone
*NL*
to
bed
feeling
less
lonely
in
the
world
by
virtue
of
that
hearty
thump
.
*NL*
Do
n't
I
remember
the
little
So-and-so
's
!
I
tell
you
I
ought
to
know
the
*NL*
right
kind
of
looks
.
I
would
have
trusted
the
deck
to
that
youngster
on
*NL*
the
strength
of
a
single
glance
,
and
gone
to
sleep
with
both
eyes
--
and
,
*NL*
by
Jove
!
it
would
n't
have
been
safe
.
There
are
depths
of
horror
in
that
*NL*
thought
.
He
looked
as
genuine
as
a
new
sovereign
,
but
there
was
some
*NL*
infernal
alloy
in
his
metal
.
How
much
?
The
least
thing
--
the
least
*NL*
drop
of
something
rare
and
accursed
;
the
least
drop
!
--
but
he
made
*NL*
you
--
standing
there
with
his
do
n't
-
care-hang
air
--
he
made
you
wonder
*NL*
whether
perchance
he
were
nothing
more
rare
than
brass
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
n't
believe
it
.
I
tell
you
I
wanted
to
see
him
squirm
for
*NL*
the
honour
of
the
craft
.
The
other
two
no-account
chaps
spotted
their
*NL*
captain
,
and
began
to
move
slowly
towards
us
.
They
chatted
together
as
*NL*
they
strolled
,
and
I
did
not
care
any
more
than
if
they
had
not
been
*NL*
visible
to
the
naked
eye
.
They
grinned
at
each
other
--
might
have
been
*NL*
exchanging
jokes
,
for
all
I
know
.
I
saw
that
with
one
of
them
it
was
a
*NL*
case
of
a
broken
arm
;
and
as
to
the
long
individual
with
grey
moustaches
*NL*
he
was
the
chief
engineer
,
and
in
various
ways
a
pretty
notorious
*NL*
personality
.
They
were
nobodies
.
They
approached
.
The
skipper
gazed
*NL*
in
an
inanimate
way
between
his
feet
:
he
seemed
to
be
swollen
to
an
*NL*
unnatural
size
by
some
awful
disease
,
by
the
mysterious
action
of
an
*NL*
unknown
poison
.
He
lifted
his
head
,
saw
the
two
before
him
waiting
,
*NL*
opened
his
mouth
with
an
extraordinary
,
sneering
contortion
of
his
*NL*
puffed
face
--
to
speak
to
them
,
I
suppose
--
and
then
a
thought
seemed
to
*NL*
strike
him
.
His
thick
,
purplish
lips
came
together
without
a
sound
,
he
*NL*
went
off
in
a
resolute
waddle
to
the
gharry
and
began
to
jerk
at
the
*NL*
door-handle
with
such
a
blind
brutality
of
impatience
that
I
expected
to
*NL*
see
the
whole
concern
overturned
on
its
side
,
pony
and
all
.
The
driver
,
*NL*
shaken
out
of
his
meditation
over
the
sole
of
his
foot
,
displayed
at
*NL*
once
all
the
signs
of
intense
terror
,
and
held
with
both
hands
,
looking
*NL*
round
from
his
box
at
this
vast
carcass
forcing
its
way
into
his
*NL*
conveyance
.
The
little
machine
shook
and
rocked
tumultuously
,
and
the
*NL*
crimson
nape
of
that
lowered
neck
,
the
size
of
those
straining
thighs
,
*NL*
the
immense
heaving
of
that
dingy
,
striped
green-and-orange
back
,
the
*NL*
whole
burrowing
effort
of
that
gaudy
and
sordid
mass
,
troubled
one
's
*NL*
sense
of
probability
with
a
droll
and
fearsome
effect
,
like
one
of
those
*NL*
grotesque
and
distinct
visions
that
scare
and
fascinate
one
in
a
fever
.
*NL*
He
disappeared
.
I
half
expected
the
roof
to
split
in
two
,
the
little
box
*NL*
on
wheels
to
burst
open
in
the
manner
of
a
ripe
cotton-pod
--
but
it
only
*NL*
sank
with
a
click
of
flattened
springs
,
and
suddenly
one
venetian
blind
*NL*
rattled
down
.
His
shoulders
reappeared
,
jammed
in
the
small
opening
;
his
*NL*
head
hung
out
,
distended
and
tossing
like
a
captive
balloon
,
perspiring
,
*NL*
furious
,
spluttering
.
He
reached
for
the
gharry-wallah
with
vicious
*NL*
flourishes
of
a
fist
as
dumpy
and
red
as
a
lump
of
raw
meat
.
He
roared
*NL*
at
him
to
be
off
,
to
go
on
.
Where
?
Into
the
Pacific
,
perhaps
.
The
driver
*NL*
lashed
;
the
pony
snorted
,
reared
once
,
and
darted
off
at
a
gallop
.
*NL*
Where
?
To
Apia
?
To
Honolulu
?
He
had
6000
miles
of
tropical
belt
to
*NL*
disport
himself
in
,
and
I
did
not
hear
the
precise
address
.
A
snorting
*NL*
pony
snatched
him
into
``
Ewigkeit
''
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
,
and
I
*NL*
never
saw
him
again
;
and
,
what
's
more
,
I
do
n't
know
of
anybody
that
ever
*NL*
had
a
glimpse
of
him
after
he
departed
from
my
knowledge
sitting
inside
*NL*
a
ramshackle
little
gharry
that
fled
round
the
corner
in
a
white
smother
*NL*
of
dust
.
He
departed
,
disappeared
,
vanished
,
absconded
;
and
absurdly
*NL*
enough
it
looked
as
though
he
had
taken
that
gharry
with
him
,
for
*NL*
never
again
did
I
come
across
a
sorrel
pony
with
a
slit
ear
and
a
*NL*
lackadaisical
Tamil
driver
afflicted
by
a
sore
foot
.
The
Pacific
is
*NL*
indeed
big
;
but
whether
he
found
a
place
for
a
display
of
his
talents
*NL*
in
it
or
not
,
the
fact
remains
he
had
flown
into
space
like
a
witch
on
a
*NL*
broomstick
.
The
little
chap
with
his
arm
in
a
sling
started
to
run
after
*NL*
the
carriage
,
bleating
,
``
Captain
!
I
say
,
Captain
!
I
sa-a-ay
!
''
--
but
after
*NL*
a
few
steps
stopped
short
,
hung
his
head
,
and
walked
back
slowly
.
At
the
*NL*
sharp
rattle
of
the
wheels
the
young
fellow
spun
round
where
he
stood
.
*NL*
He
made
no
other
movement
,
no
gesture
,
no
sign
,
and
remained
facing
in
*NL*
the
new
direction
after
the
gharry
had
swung
out
of
sight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
this
happened
in
much
less
time
than
it
takes
to
tell
,
since
I
am
*NL*
trying
to
interpret
for
you
into
slow
speech
the
instantaneous
effect
of
*NL*
visual
impressions
.
Next
moment
the
half-caste
clerk
,
sent
by
Archie
*NL*
to
look
a
little
after
the
poor
castaways
of
the
Patna
,
came
upon
the
*NL*
scene
.
He
ran
out
eager
and
bareheaded
,
looking
right
and
left
,
and
*NL*
very
full
of
his
mission
.
It
was
doomed
to
be
a
failure
as
far
as
the
*NL*
principal
person
was
concerned
,
but
he
approached
the
others
with
fussy
*NL*
importance
,
and
,
almost
immediately
,
found
himself
involved
in
a
violent
*NL*
altercation
with
the
chap
that
carried
his
arm
in
a
sling
,
and
who
*NL*
turned
out
to
be
extremely
anxious
for
a
row
.
He
was
n't
going
to
be
*NL*
ordered
about
--
``
not
he
,
b
`
gosh
.
''
He
would
n't
be
terrified
with
a
pack
*NL*
of
lies
by
a
cocky
half-bred
little
quill-driver
.
He
was
not
going
to
be
*NL*
bullied
by
``
no
object
of
that
sort
,
''
if
the
story
were
true
``
ever
so
''
!
*NL*
He
bawled
his
wish
,
his
desire
,
his
determination
to
go
to
bed
.
``
If
you
*NL*
were
n't
a
God-forsaken
Portuguee
,
''
I
heard
him
yell
,
``
you
would
know
*NL*
that
the
hospital
is
the
right
place
for
me
.
''
He
pushed
the
fist
of
*NL*
his
sound
arm
under
the
other
's
nose
;
a
crowd
began
to
collect
;
the
*NL*
half-caste
,
flustered
,
but
doing
his
best
to
appear
dignified
,
tried
to
*NL*
explain
his
intentions
.
I
went
away
without
waiting
to
see
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
so
happened
that
I
had
a
man
in
the
hospital
at
the
time
,
and
*NL*
going
there
to
see
about
him
the
day
before
the
opening
of
the
Inquiry
,
*NL*
I
saw
in
the
white
men
's
ward
that
little
chap
tossing
on
his
back
,
with
*NL*
his
arm
in
splints
,
and
quite
light-headed
.
To
my
great
surprise
the
*NL*
other
one
,
the
long
individual
with
drooping
white
moustache
,
had
also
*NL*
found
his
way
there
.
I
remembered
I
had
seen
him
slinking
away
during
*NL*
the
quarrel
,
in
a
half
prance
,
half
shuffle
,
and
trying
very
hard
not
*NL*
to
look
scared
.
He
was
no
stranger
to
the
port
,
it
seems
,
and
in
his
*NL*
distress
was
able
to
make
tracks
straight
for
Mariani
's
billiard-room
*NL*
and
grog-shop
near
the
bazaar
.
That
unspeakable
vagabond
,
Mariani
,
who
*NL*
had
known
the
man
and
had
ministered
to
his
vices
in
one
or
two
other
*NL*
places
,
kissed
the
ground
,
in
a
manner
of
speaking
,
before
him
,
and
*NL*
shut
him
up
with
a
supply
of
bottles
in
an
upstairs
room
of
his
infamous
*NL*
hovel
.
It
appears
he
was
under
some
hazy
apprehension
as
to
his
personal
*NL*
safety
,
and
wished
to
be
concealed
.
However
,
Mariani
told
me
a
long
time
*NL*
after
-LRB-
when
he
came
on
board
one
day
to
dun
my
steward
for
the
price
*NL*
of
some
cigars
-RRB-
that
he
would
have
done
more
for
him
without
asking
*NL*
any
questions
,
from
gratitude
for
some
unholy
favour
received
very
*NL*
many
years
ago
--
as
far
as
I
could
make
out
.
He
thumped
twice
his
brawny
*NL*
chest
,
rolled
enormous
black-and-white
eyes
glistening
with
tears
:
*NL*
``
Antonio
never
forget
--
Antonio
never
forget
!
''
What
was
the
precise
*NL*
nature
of
the
immoral
obligation
I
never
learned
,
but
be
it
what
it
may
,
*NL*
he
had
every
facility
given
him
to
remain
under
lock
and
key
,
with
a
*NL*
chair
,
a
table
,
a
mattress
in
a
corner
,
and
a
litter
of
fallen
plaster
*NL*
on
the
floor
,
in
an
irrational
state
of
funk
,
and
keeping
up
his
pecker
*NL*
with
such
tonics
as
Mariani
dispensed
.
This
lasted
till
the
evening
of
*NL*
the
third
day
,
when
,
after
letting
out
a
few
horrible
screams
,
he
found
*NL*
himself
compelled
to
seek
safety
in
flight
from
a
legion
of
centipedes
.
*NL*
He
burst
the
door
open
,
made
one
leap
for
dear
life
down
the
crazy
*NL*
little
stairway
,
landed
bodily
on
Mariani
's
stomach
,
picked
himself
up
,
*NL*
and
bolted
like
a
rabbit
into
the
streets
.
The
police
plucked
him
off
*NL*
a
garbage-heap
in
the
early
morning
.
At
first
he
had
a
notion
they
were
*NL*
carrying
him
off
to
be
hanged
,
and
fought
for
liberty
like
a
hero
,
but
*NL*
when
I
sat
down
by
his
bed
he
had
been
very
quiet
for
two
days
.
His
lean
*NL*
bronzed
head
,
with
white
moustaches
,
looked
fine
and
calm
on
the
pillow
,
*NL*
like
the
head
of
a
war-worn
soldier
with
a
child-like
soul
,
had
it
not
*NL*
been
for
a
hint
of
spectral
alarm
that
lurked
in
the
blank
glitter
of
*NL*
his
glance
,
resembling
a
nondescript
form
of
a
terror
crouching
silently
*NL*
behind
a
pane
of
glass
.
He
was
so
extremely
calm
,
that
I
began
to
*NL*
indulge
in
the
eccentric
hope
of
hearing
something
explanatory
of
the
*NL*
famous
affair
from
his
point
of
view
.
Why
I
longed
to
go
grubbing
into
*NL*
the
deplorable
details
of
an
occurrence
which
,
after
all
,
concerned
me
*NL*
no
more
than
as
a
member
of
an
obscure
body
of
men
held
together
by
a
*NL*
community
of
inglorious
toil
and
by
fidelity
to
a
certain
standard
of
*NL*
conduct
,
I
ca
n't
explain
.
You
may
call
it
an
unhealthy
curiosity
if
you
*NL*
like
;
but
I
have
a
distinct
notion
I
wished
to
find
something
.
Perhaps
,
*NL*
unconsciously
,
I
hoped
I
would
find
that
something
,
some
profound
and
*NL*
redeeming
cause
,
some
merciful
explanation
,
some
convincing
shadow
of
an
*NL*
excuse
.
I
see
well
enough
now
that
I
hoped
for
the
impossible
--
for
the
*NL*
laying
of
what
is
the
most
obstinate
ghost
of
man
's
creation
,
of
the
*NL*
uneasy
doubt
uprising
like
a
mist
,
secret
and
gnawing
like
a
worm
,
and
*NL*
more
chilling
than
the
certitude
of
death
--
the
doubt
of
the
sovereign
*NL*
power
enthroned
in
a
fixed
standard
of
conduct
.
It
is
the
hardest
thing
*NL*
to
stumble
against
;
it
is
the
thing
that
breeds
yelling
panics
and
good
*NL*
little
quiet
villainies
;
it
's
the
true
shadow
of
calamity
.
Did
I
believe
*NL*
in
a
miracle
?
and
why
did
I
desire
it
so
ardently
?
Was
it
for
my
own
*NL*
sake
that
I
wished
to
find
some
shadow
of
an
excuse
for
that
young
*NL*
fellow
whom
I
had
never
seen
before
,
but
whose
appearance
alone
added
a
*NL*
touch
of
personal
concern
to
the
thoughts
suggested
by
the
knowledge
of
*NL*
his
weakness
--
made
it
a
thing
of
mystery
and
terror
--
like
a
hint
of
a
*NL*
destructive
fate
ready
for
us
all
whose
youth
--
in
its
day
--
had
resembled
*NL*
his
youth
?
I
fear
that
such
was
the
secret
motive
of
my
prying
.
I
was
,
*NL*
and
no
mistake
,
looking
for
a
miracle
.
The
only
thing
that
at
*NL*
this
distance
of
time
strikes
me
as
miraculous
is
the
extent
of
my
*NL*
imbecility
.
I
positively
hoped
to
obtain
from
that
battered
and
shady
*NL*
invalid
some
exorcism
against
the
ghost
of
doubt
.
I
must
have
been
*NL*
pretty
desperate
too
,
for
,
without
loss
of
time
,
after
a
few
indifferent
*NL*
and
friendly
sentences
which
he
answered
with
languid
readiness
,
just
as
*NL*
any
decent
sick
man
would
do
,
I
produced
the
word
Patna
wrapped
up
in
a
*NL*
delicate
question
as
in
a
wisp
of
floss
silk
.
I
was
delicate
selfishly
;
*NL*
I
did
not
want
to
startle
him
;
I
had
no
solicitude
for
him
;
I
was
not
*NL*
furious
with
him
and
sorry
for
him
:
his
experience
was
of
no
importance
,
*NL*
his
redemption
would
have
had
no
point
for
me
.
He
had
grown
old
in
minor
*NL*
iniquities
,
and
could
no
longer
inspire
aversion
or
pity
.
He
repeated
*NL*
Patna
?
interrogatively
,
seemed
to
make
a
short
effort
of
memory
,
and
*NL*
said
:
``
Quite
right
.
I
am
an
old
stager
out
here
.
I
saw
her
go
down
.
''
I
*NL*
made
ready
to
vent
my
indignation
at
such
a
stupid
lie
,
when
he
added
*NL*
smoothly
,
``
She
was
full
of
reptiles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
made
me
pause
.
What
did
he
mean
?
The
unsteady
phantom
of
terror
*NL*
behind
his
glassy
eyes
seemed
to
stand
still
and
look
into
mine
*NL*
wistfully
.
``
They
turned
me
out
of
my
bunk
in
the
middle
watch
to
look
*NL*
at
her
sinking
,
''
he
pursued
in
a
reflective
tone
.
His
voice
sounded
*NL*
alarmingly
strong
all
at
once
.
I
was
sorry
for
my
folly
.
There
was
*NL*
no
snowy-winged
coif
of
a
nursing
sister
to
be
seen
flitting
in
the
*NL*
perspective
of
the
ward
;
but
away
in
the
middle
of
a
long
row
of
empty
*NL*
iron
bedsteads
an
accident
case
from
some
ship
in
the
Roads
sat
up
brown
*NL*
and
gaunt
with
a
white
bandage
set
rakishly
on
the
forehead
.
Suddenly
my
*NL*
interesting
invalid
shot
out
an
arm
thin
like
a
tentacle
and
clawed
*NL*
my
shoulder
.
``
Only
my
eyes
were
good
enough
to
see
.
I
am
famous
for
my
*NL*
eyesight
.
That
's
why
they
called
me
,
I
expect
.
None
of
them
was
quick
*NL*
enough
to
see
her
go
,
but
they
saw
that
she
was
gone
right
enough
,
and
*NL*
sang
out
together
--
like
this
.
''
...
A
wolfish
howl
searched
the
very
*NL*
recesses
of
my
soul
.
``
Oh
!
make
`
im
dry
up
,
''
whined
the
accident
case
*NL*
irritably
.
``
You
do
n't
believe
me
,
I
suppose
,
''
went
on
the
other
,
with
*NL*
an
air
of
ineffable
conceit
.
``
I
tell
you
there
are
no
such
eyes
as
mine
*NL*
this
side
of
the
Persian
Gulf
.
Look
under
the
bed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
I
stooped
instantly
.
I
defy
anybody
not
to
have
done
so
.
*NL*
``
What
can
you
see
?
''
he
asked
.
``
Nothing
,
''
I
said
,
feeling
awfully
ashamed
*NL*
of
myself
.
He
scrutinised
my
face
with
wild
and
withering
contempt
.
*NL*
``
Just
so
,
''
he
said
,
``
but
if
I
were
to
look
I
could
see
--
there
's
no
eyes
*NL*
like
mine
,
I
tell
you
.
''
Again
he
clawed
,
pulling
at
me
downwards
in
his
*NL*
eagerness
to
relieve
himself
by
a
confidential
communication
.
``
Millions
*NL*
of
pink
toads
.
There
's
no
eyes
like
mine
.
Millions
of
pink
toads
.
It
's
*NL*
worse
than
seeing
a
ship
sink
.
I
could
look
at
sinking
ships
and
smoke
*NL*
my
pipe
all
day
long
.
Why
do
n't
they
give
me
back
my
pipe
?
I
would
get
*NL*
a
smoke
while
I
watched
these
toads
.
The
ship
was
full
of
them
.
They
've
*NL*
got
to
be
watched
,
you
know
.
''
He
winked
facetiously
.
The
perspiration
*NL*
dripped
on
him
off
my
head
,
my
drill
coat
clung
to
my
wet
back
:
the
*NL*
afternoon
breeze
swept
impetuously
over
the
row
of
bedsteads
,
the
stiff
*NL*
folds
of
curtains
stirred
perpendicularly
,
rattling
on
brass
rods
,
the
*NL*
covers
of
empty
beds
blew
about
noiselessly
near
the
bare
floor
all
*NL*
along
the
line
,
and
I
shivered
to
the
very
marrow
.
The
soft
wind
of
the
*NL*
tropics
played
in
that
naked
ward
as
bleak
as
a
winter
's
gale
in
an
old
*NL*
barn
at
home
.
``
Do
n't
you
let
him
start
his
hollering
,
mister
,
''
hailed
*NL*
from
afar
the
accident
case
in
a
distressed
angry
shout
that
came
*NL*
ringing
between
the
walls
like
a
quavering
call
down
a
tunnel
.
The
*NL*
clawing
hand
hauled
at
my
shoulder
;
he
leered
at
me
knowingly
.
``
The
ship
*NL*
was
full
of
them
,
you
know
,
and
we
had
to
clear
out
on
the
strict
Q.T.
,
''
*NL*
he
whispered
with
extreme
rapidity
.
``
All
pink
.
All
pink
--
as
big
as
*NL*
mastiffs
,
with
an
eye
on
the
top
of
the
head
and
claws
all
round
their
*NL*
ugly
mouths
.
Ough
!
Ough
!
''
Quick
jerks
as
of
galvanic
shocks
disclosed
*NL*
under
the
flat
coverlet
the
outlines
of
meagre
and
agitated
legs
;
he
let
*NL*
go
my
shoulder
and
reached
after
something
in
the
air
;
his
body
trembled
*NL*
tensely
like
a
released
harp-string
;
and
while
I
looked
down
,
the
*NL*
spectral
horror
in
him
broke
through
his
glassy
gaze
.
Instantly
his
face
*NL*
of
an
old
soldier
,
with
its
noble
and
calm
outlines
,
became
decomposed
*NL*
before
my
eyes
by
the
corruption
of
stealthy
cunning
,
of
an
abominable
*NL*
caution
and
of
desperate
fear
.
He
restrained
a
cry
--
``
Ssh
!
what
are
they
*NL*
doing
now
down
there
?
''
he
asked
,
pointing
to
the
floor
with
fantastic
*NL*
precautions
of
voice
and
gesture
,
whose
meaning
,
borne
upon
my
mind
in
a
*NL*
lurid
flash
,
made
me
very
sick
of
my
cleverness
.
``
They
are
all
asleep
,
''
*NL*
I
answered
,
watching
him
narrowly
.
That
was
it
.
That
's
what
he
wanted
*NL*
to
hear
;
these
were
the
exact
words
that
could
calm
him
.
He
drew
a
long
*NL*
breath
.
``
Ssh
!
Quiet
,
steady
.
I
am
an
old
stager
out
here
.
I
know
them
*NL*
brutes
.
Bash
in
the
head
of
the
first
that
stirs
.
There
's
too
many
of
*NL*
them
,
and
she
wo
n't
swim
more
than
ten
minutes
.
''
He
panted
again
.
``
Hurry
*NL*
up
,
''
he
yelled
suddenly
,
and
went
on
in
a
steady
scream
:
``
They
are
all
*NL*
awake
--
millions
of
them
.
They
are
trampling
on
me
!
Wait
!
Oh
,
wait
!
*NL*
I
'll
smash
them
in
heaps
like
flies
.
Wait
for
me
!
Help
!
H-e-elp
!
''
An
*NL*
interminable
and
sustained
howl
completed
my
discomfiture
.
I
saw
in
*NL*
the
distance
the
accident
case
raise
deplorably
both
his
hands
to
his
*NL*
bandaged
head
;
a
dresser
,
aproned
to
the
chin
showed
himself
in
the
*NL*
vista
of
the
ward
,
as
if
seen
in
the
small
end
of
a
telescope
.
I
*NL*
confessed
myself
fairly
routed
,
and
without
more
ado
,
stepping
out
*NL*
through
one
of
the
long
windows
,
escaped
into
the
outside
gallery
.
The
*NL*
howl
pursued
me
like
a
vengeance
.
I
turned
into
a
deserted
landing
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
all
became
very
still
and
quiet
around
me
,
and
I
descended
*NL*
the
bare
and
shiny
staircase
in
a
silence
that
enabled
me
to
compose
my
*NL*
distracted
thoughts
.
Down
below
I
met
one
of
the
resident
surgeons
*NL*
who
was
crossing
the
courtyard
and
stopped
me
.
``
Been
to
see
your
man
,
*NL*
Captain
?
I
think
we
may
let
him
go
to-morrow
.
These
fools
have
no
*NL*
notion
of
taking
care
of
themselves
,
though
.
I
say
,
we
've
got
the
chief
*NL*
engineer
of
that
pilgrim
ship
here
.
A
curious
case
.
D.T.
's
of
the
worst
*NL*
kind
.
He
has
been
drinking
hard
in
that
Greek
's
or
Italian
's
grog-shop
*NL*
for
three
days
.
What
can
you
expect
?
Four
bottles
of
that
kind
of
brandy
*NL*
a
day
,
I
am
told
.
Wonderful
,
if
true
.
Sheeted
with
boiler-iron
inside
I
*NL*
should
think
.
The
head
,
ah
!
the
head
,
of
course
,
gone
,
but
the
curious
*NL*
part
is
there
's
some
sort
of
method
in
his
raving
.
I
am
trying
to
*NL*
find
out
.
Most
unusual
--
that
thread
of
logic
in
such
a
delirium
.
*NL*
Traditionally
he
ought
to
see
snakes
,
but
he
does
n't
.
Good
old
*NL*
tradition
's
at
a
discount
nowadays
.
Eh
!
His
--
er
--
visions
are
batrachian
.
*NL*
Ha
!
ha
!
No
,
seriously
,
I
never
remember
being
so
interested
in
a
case
*NL*
of
jim-jams
before
.
He
ought
to
be
dead
,
do
n't
you
know
,
after
such
a
*NL*
festive
experiment
.
Oh
!
he
is
a
tough
object
.
Four-and-twenty
years
of
*NL*
the
tropics
too
.
You
ought
really
to
take
a
peep
at
him
.
Noble-looking
*NL*
old
boozer
.
Most
extraordinary
man
I
ever
met
--
medically
,
of
course
.
*NL*
Wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
been
all
along
exhibiting
the
usual
polite
signs
of
interest
,
*NL*
but
now
assuming
an
air
of
regret
I
murmured
of
want
of
time
,
and
shook
*NL*
hands
in
a
hurry
.
``
I
say
,
''
he
cried
after
me
;
``
he
ca
n't
attend
that
*NL*
inquiry
.
Is
his
evidence
material
,
you
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Not
in
the
least
,

I
called
back
from
the
gateway

*NL*
CHAPTER
6
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
authorities
were
evidently
of
the
same
opinion
.
The
inquiry
was
not
*NL*
adjourned
.
It
was
held
on
the
appointed
day
to
satisfy
the
law
,
and
it
*NL*
was
well
attended
because
of
its
human
interest
,
no
doubt
.
There
was
no
*NL*
incertitude
as
to
facts
--
as
to
the
one
material
fact
,
I
mean
.
How
the
*NL*
Patna
came
by
her
hurt
it
was
impossible
to
find
out
;
the
court
did
not
*NL*
expect
to
find
out
;
and
in
the
whole
audience
there
was
not
a
man
who
*NL*
cared
.
Yet
,
as
I
've
told
you
,
all
the
sailors
in
the
port
attended
,
and
*NL*
the
waterside
business
was
fully
represented
.
Whether
they
knew
it
or
*NL*
not
,
the
interest
that
drew
them
here
was
purely
psychological
--
the
*NL*
expectation
of
some
essential
disclosure
as
to
the
strength
,
the
power
,
*NL*
the
horror
,
of
human
emotions
.
Naturally
nothing
of
the
kind
could
be
*NL*
disclosed
.
The
examination
of
the
only
man
able
and
willing
to
face
*NL*
it
was
beating
futilely
round
the
well-known
fact
,
and
the
play
of
*NL*
questions
upon
it
was
as
instructive
as
the
tapping
with
a
hammer
on
*NL*
an
iron
box
,
were
the
object
to
find
out
what
's
inside
.
However
,
an
*NL*
official
inquiry
could
not
be
any
other
thing
.
Its
object
was
not
the
*NL*
fundamental
why
,
but
the
superficial
how
,
of
this
affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
young
chap
could
have
told
them
,
and
,
though
that
very
thing
*NL*
was
the
thing
that
interested
the
audience
,
the
questions
put
to
him
*NL*
necessarily
led
him
away
from
what
to
me
,
for
instance
,
would
have
*NL*
been
the
only
truth
worth
knowing
.
You
ca
n't
expect
the
constituted
*NL*
authorities
to
inquire
into
the
state
of
a
man
's
soul
--
or
is
it
only
of
*NL*
his
liver
?
Their
business
was
to
come
down
upon
the
consequences
,
and
*NL*
frankly
,
a
casual
police
magistrate
and
two
nautical
assessors
are
not
*NL*
much
good
for
anything
else
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
imply
these
fellows
were
*NL*
stupid
.
The
magistrate
was
very
patient
.
One
of
the
assessors
was
a
*NL*
sailing-ship
skipper
with
a
reddish
beard
,
and
of
a
pious
disposition
.
*NL*
Brierly
was
the
other
.
Big
Brierly
.
Some
of
you
must
have
heard
of
Big
*NL*
Brierly
--
the
captain
of
the
crack
ship
of
the
Blue
Star
line
.
That
's
the
*NL*
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
seemed
consumedly
bored
by
the
honour
thrust
upon
him
.
He
had
never
*NL*
in
his
life
made
a
mistake
,
never
had
an
accident
,
never
a
mishap
,
*NL*
never
a
check
in
his
steady
rise
,
and
he
seemed
to
be
one
of
those
lucky
*NL*
fellows
who
know
nothing
of
indecision
,
much
less
of
self-mistrust
.
*NL*
At
thirty-two
he
had
one
of
the
best
commands
going
in
the
Eastern
*NL*
trade
--
and
,
what
's
more
,
he
thought
a
lot
of
what
he
had
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
like
it
in
the
world
,
and
I
suppose
if
you
had
asked
him
*NL*
point-blank
he
would
have
confessed
that
in
his
opinion
there
was
not
*NL*
such
another
commander
.
The
choice
had
fallen
upon
the
right
man
.
The
*NL*
rest
of
mankind
that
did
not
command
the
sixteen-knot
steel
steamer
Ossa
*NL*
were
rather
poor
creatures
.
He
had
saved
lives
at
sea
,
had
rescued
*NL*
ships
in
distress
,
had
a
gold
chronometer
presented
to
him
by
the
*NL*
underwriters
,
and
a
pair
of
binoculars
with
a
suitable
inscription
from
*NL*
some
foreign
Government
,
in
commemoration
of
these
services
.
He
was
*NL*
acutely
aware
of
his
merits
and
of
his
rewards
.
I
liked
him
well
enough
,
*NL*
though
some
I
know
--
meek
,
friendly
men
at
that
--
could
n't
stand
him
at
*NL*
any
price
.
I
have
n't
the
slightest
doubt
he
considered
himself
vastly
my
*NL*
superior
--
indeed
,
had
you
been
Emperor
of
East
and
West
,
you
could
not
*NL*
have
ignored
your
inferiority
in
his
presence
--
but
I
could
n't
get
up
any
*NL*
real
sentiment
of
offence
.
He
did
not
despise
me
for
anything
I
could
*NL*
help
,
for
anything
I
was
--
do
n't
you
know
?
I
was
a
negligible
quantity
*NL*
simply
because
I
was
not
_
the
_
fortunate
man
of
the
earth
,
not
Montague
*NL*
Brierly
in
command
of
the
Ossa
,
not
the
owner
of
an
inscribed
gold
*NL*
chronometer
and
of
silver-mounted
binoculars
testifying
to
the
*NL*
excellence
of
my
seamanship
and
to
my
indomitable
pluck
;
not
possessed
*NL*
of
an
acute
sense
of
my
merits
and
of
my
rewards
,
besides
the
love
and
*NL*
worship
of
a
black
retriever
,
the
most
wonderful
of
its
kind
--
for
never
*NL*
was
such
a
man
loved
thus
by
such
a
dog
.
No
doubt
,
to
have
all
this
*NL*
forced
upon
you
was
exasperating
enough
;
but
when
I
reflected
that
I
was
*NL*
associated
in
these
fatal
disadvantages
with
twelve
hundred
millions
of
*NL*
other
more
or
less
human
beings
,
I
found
I
could
bear
my
share
of
his
*NL*
good-natured
and
contemptuous
pity
for
the
sake
of
something
indefinite
*NL*
and
attractive
in
the
man
.
I
have
never
defined
to
myself
this
*NL*
attraction
,
but
there
were
moments
when
I
envied
him
.
The
sting
of
life
*NL*
could
do
no
more
to
his
complacent
soul
than
the
scratch
of
a
pin
to
the
*NL*
smooth
face
of
a
rock
.
This
was
enviable
.
As
I
looked
at
him
,
flanking
*NL*
on
one
side
the
unassuming
pale-faced
magistrate
who
presided
at
the
*NL*
inquiry
,
his
self-satisfaction
presented
to
me
and
to
the
world
a
*NL*
surface
as
hard
as
granite
.
He
committed
suicide
very
soon
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
No
wonder
Jim
's
case
bored
him
,
and
while
I
thought
with
something
*NL*
akin
to
fear
of
the
immensity
of
his
contempt
for
the
young
man
under
*NL*
examination
,
he
was
probably
holding
silent
inquiry
into
his
own
case
.
*NL*
The
verdict
must
have
been
of
unmitigated
guilt
,
and
he
took
the
secret
*NL*
of
the
evidence
with
him
in
that
leap
into
the
sea
.
If
I
understand
*NL*
anything
of
men
,
the
matter
was
no
doubt
of
the
gravest
import
,
one
of
*NL*
those
trifles
that
awaken
ideas
--
start
into
life
some
thought
with
which
*NL*
a
man
unused
to
such
a
companionship
finds
it
impossible
to
live
.
I
am
*NL*
in
a
position
to
know
that
it
was
n't
money
,
and
it
was
n't
drink
,
and
it
*NL*
was
n't
woman
.
He
jumped
overboard
at
sea
barely
a
week
after
the
end
of
*NL*
the
inquiry
,
and
less
than
three
days
after
leaving
port
on
his
outward
*NL*
passage
;
as
though
on
that
exact
spot
in
the
midst
of
waters
he
had
*NL*
suddenly
perceived
the
gates
of
the
other
world
flung
open
wide
for
his
*NL*
reception
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yet
it
was
not
a
sudden
impulse
.
His
grey-headed
mate
,
a
first-rate
*NL*
sailor
and
a
nice
old
chap
with
strangers
,
but
in
his
relations
with
*NL*
his
commander
the
surliest
chief
officer
I
've
ever
seen
,
would
tell
the
*NL*
story
with
tears
in
his
eyes
.
It
appears
that
when
he
came
on
deck
in
*NL*
the
morning
Brierly
had
been
writing
in
the
chart-room
.
``
It
was
ten
*NL*
minutes
to
four
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
the
middle
watch
was
not
relieved
yet
of
*NL*
course
.
He
heard
my
voice
on
the
bridge
speaking
to
the
second
mate
,
and
*NL*
called
me
in
.
I
was
loth
to
go
,
and
that
's
the
truth
,
Captain
Marlow
--
I
*NL*
could
n't
stand
poor
Captain
Brierly
,
I
tell
you
with
shame
;
we
never
*NL*
know
what
a
man
is
made
of
.
He
had
been
promoted
over
too
many
heads
,
*NL*
not
counting
my
own
,
and
he
had
a
damnable
trick
of
making
you
feel
*NL*
small
,
nothing
but
by
the
way
he
said
`
Good
morning
.
'
I
never
addressed
*NL*
him
,
sir
,
but
on
matters
of
duty
,
and
then
it
was
as
much
as
I
could
do
*NL*
to
keep
a
civil
tongue
in
my
head
.
''
-LRB-
He
flattered
himself
there
.
I
often
*NL*
wondered
how
Brierly
could
put
up
with
his
manners
for
more
than
half
*NL*
a
voyage
.
-RRB-
``
I
've
a
wife
and
children
,
''
he
went
on
,
``
and
I
had
been
ten
*NL*
years
in
the
Company
,
always
expecting
the
next
command
--
more
fool
I.
*NL*
Says
he
,
just
like
this
:
`
Come
in
here
,
Mr.
Jones
,
'
in
that
swagger
*NL*
voice
of
his
--
`
Come
in
here
,
Mr.
Jones
.
'
In
I
went
.
`
We
'll
lay
down
her
*NL*
position
,
'
says
he
,
stooping
over
the
chart
,
a
pair
of
dividers
in
hand
.
*NL*
By
the
standing
orders
,
the
officer
going
off
duty
would
have
done
that
*NL*
at
the
end
of
his
watch
.
However
,
I
said
nothing
,
and
looked
on
while
he
*NL*
marked
off
the
ship
's
position
with
a
tiny
cross
and
wrote
the
date
and
*NL*
the
time
.
I
can
see
him
this
moment
writing
his
neat
figures
:
seventeen
,
*NL*
eight
,
four
A.M.
.
The
year
would
be
written
in
red
ink
at
the
top
of
*NL*
the
chart
.
He
never
used
his
charts
more
than
a
year
,
Captain
Brierly
*NL*
did
n't
.
I
've
the
chart
now
.
When
he
had
done
he
stands
looking
down
*NL*
at
the
mark
he
had
made
and
smiling
to
himself
,
then
looks
up
at
me
.
*NL*
`
Thirty-two
miles
more
as
she
goes
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
then
we
shall
be
*NL*
clear
,
and
you
may
alter
the
course
twenty
degrees
to
the
southward
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
We
were
passing
to
the
north
of
the
Hector
Bank
that
voyage
.
I
said
,
*NL*
`
All
right
,
sir
,
'
wondering
what
he
was
fussing
about
,
since
I
had
to
*NL*
call
him
before
altering
the
course
anyhow
.
Just
then
eight
bells
were
*NL*
struck
:
we
came
out
on
the
bridge
,
and
the
second
mate
before
going
off
*NL*
mentions
in
the
usual
way
--
`
Seventy-one
on
the
log
.
'
Captain
Brierly
*NL*
looks
at
the
compass
and
then
all
round
.
It
was
dark
and
clear
,
and
*NL*
all
the
stars
were
out
as
plain
as
on
a
frosty
night
in
high
latitudes
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
says
with
a
sort
of
a
little
sigh
:
'
I
am
going
aft
,
and
*NL*
shall
set
the
log
at
zero
for
you
myself
,
so
that
there
can
be
no
*NL*
mistake
.
Thirty-two
miles
more
on
this
course
and
then
you
are
safe
.
*NL*
Let
's
see
--
the
correction
on
the
log
is
six
per
cent
.
additive
;
say
,
*NL*
then
,
thirty
by
the
dial
to
run
,
and
you
may
come
twenty
degrees
to
*NL*
starboard
at
once
.
No
use
losing
any
distance
--
is
there
?
'
I
had
never
*NL*
heard
him
talk
so
much
at
a
stretch
,
and
to
no
purpose
as
it
seemed
*NL*
to
me
.
I
said
nothing
.
He
went
down
the
ladder
,
and
the
dog
,
that
was
*NL*
always
at
his
heels
whenever
he
moved
,
night
or
day
,
followed
,
*NL*
sliding
nose
first
,
after
him
.
I
heard
his
boot-heels
tap
,
tap
on
the
*NL*
after-deck
,
then
he
stopped
and
spoke
to
the
dog
--
`
Go
back
,
Rover
.
On
*NL*
the
bridge
,
boy
!
Go
on
--
get
.
'
Then
he
calls
out
to
me
from
the
dark
,
*NL*
`
Shut
that
dog
up
in
the
chart-room
,
Mr.
Jones
--
will
you
?
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
This
was
the
last
time
I
heard
his
voice
,
Captain
Marlow
.
These
are
*NL*
the
last
words
he
spoke
in
the
hearing
of
any
living
human
being
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
At
this
point
the
old
chap
's
voice
got
quite
unsteady
.
``
He
was
afraid
*NL*
the
poor
brute
would
jump
after
him
,
do
n't
you
see
?
''
he
pursued
with
*NL*
a
quaver
.
``
Yes
,
Captain
Marlow
.
He
set
the
log
for
me
;
he
--
would
you
*NL*
believe
it
?
--
he
put
a
drop
of
oil
in
it
too
.
There
was
the
oil-feeder
*NL*
where
he
left
it
near
by
.
The
boat-swain
's
mate
got
the
hose
along
aft
*NL*
to
wash
down
at
half-past
five
;
by-and-by
he
knocks
off
and
runs
up
on
*NL*
the
bridge
--
`
Will
you
please
come
aft
,
Mr.
Jones
,
'
he
says
.
`
There
's
a
*NL*
funny
thing
.
I
do
n't
like
to
touch
it
.
'
It
was
Captain
Brierly
's
gold
*NL*
chronometer
watch
carefully
hung
under
the
rail
by
its
chain
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
As
soon
as
my
eyes
fell
on
it
something
struck
me
,
and
I
knew
,
sir
.
My
*NL*
legs
got
soft
under
me
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
seen
him
go
over
;
and
I
could
*NL*
tell
how
far
behind
he
was
left
too
.
The
taffrail-log
marked
eighteen
*NL*
miles
and
three-quarters
,
and
four
iron
belaying-pins
were
missing
round
*NL*
the
mainmast
.
Put
them
in
his
pockets
to
help
him
down
,
I
suppose
;
but
,
*NL*
Lord
!
what
's
four
iron
pins
to
a
powerful
man
like
Captain
Brierly
.
*NL*
Maybe
his
confidence
in
himself
was
just
shook
a
bit
at
the
last
.
That
's
*NL*
the
only
sign
of
fluster
he
gave
in
his
whole
life
,
I
should
think
;
but
*NL*
I
am
ready
to
answer
for
him
,
that
once
over
he
did
not
try
to
swim
a
*NL*
stroke
,
the
same
as
he
would
have
had
pluck
enough
to
keep
up
all
day
*NL*
long
on
the
bare
chance
had
he
fallen
overboard
accidentally
.
Yes
,
sir
.
*NL*
He
was
second
to
none
--
if
he
said
so
himself
,
as
I
heard
him
once
.
He
*NL*
had
written
two
letters
in
the
middle
watch
,
one
to
the
Company
and
the
*NL*
other
to
me
.
He
gave
me
a
lot
of
instructions
as
to
the
passage
--
I
had
*NL*
been
in
the
trade
before
he
was
out
of
his
time
--
and
no
end
of
hints
*NL*
as
to
my
conduct
with
our
people
in
Shanghai
,
so
that
I
should
keep
the
*NL*
command
of
the
Ossa
.
He
wrote
like
a
father
would
to
a
favourite
son
,
*NL*
Captain
Marlow
,
and
I
was
five-and-twenty
years
his
senior
and
had
*NL*
tasted
salt
water
before
he
was
fairly
breeched
.
In
his
letter
to
the
*NL*
owners
--
it
was
left
open
for
me
to
see
--
he
said
that
he
had
always
done
*NL*
his
duty
by
them
--
up
to
that
moment
--
and
even
now
he
was
not
betraying
*NL*
their
confidence
,
since
he
was
leaving
the
ship
to
as
competent
a
seaman
*NL*
as
could
be
found
--
meaning
me
,
sir
,
meaning
me
!
He
told
them
that
if
*NL*
the
last
act
of
his
life
did
n't
take
away
all
his
credit
with
them
,
they
*NL*
would
give
weight
to
my
faithful
service
and
to
his
warm
recommendation
,
*NL*
when
about
to
fill
the
vacancy
made
by
his
death
.
And
much
more
like
*NL*
this
,
sir
.
I
could
n't
believe
my
eyes
.
It
made
me
feel
queer
all
over
,
''
*NL*
went
on
the
old
chap
,
in
great
perturbation
,
and
squashing
something
*NL*
in
the
corner
of
his
eye
with
the
end
of
a
thumb
as
broad
as
a
spatula
.
*NL*
``
You
would
think
,
sir
,
he
had
jumped
overboard
only
to
give
an
unlucky
*NL*
man
a
last
show
to
get
on
.
What
with
the
shock
of
him
going
in
this
*NL*
awful
rash
way
,
and
thinking
myself
a
made
man
by
that
chance
,
I
was
*NL*
nearly
off
my
chump
for
a
week
.
But
no
fear
.
The
captain
of
the
Pelion
*NL*
was
shifted
into
the
Ossa
--
came
aboard
in
Shanghai
--
a
little
popinjay
,
*NL*
sir
,
in
a
grey
check
suit
,
with
his
hair
parted
in
the
middle
.
`
Aw
--
I
*NL*
am
--
aw
--
your
new
captain
,
Mister
--
Mister
--
aw
--
Jones
.
'
He
was
drowned
in
*NL*
scent
--
fairly
stunk
with
it
,
Captain
Marlow
.
I
dare
say
it
was
the
look
*NL*
I
gave
him
that
made
him
stammer
.
He
mumbled
something
about
my
natural
*NL*
disappointment
--
I
had
better
know
at
once
that
his
chief
officer
got
*NL*
the
promotion
to
the
Pelion
--
he
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
of
*NL*
course
--
supposed
the
office
knew
best
--
sorry
...
Says
I
,
`
Do
n't
*NL*
you
mind
old
Jones
,
sir
;
dam
'
his
soul
,
he
's
used
to
it
.
'
I
could
see
*NL*
directly
I
had
shocked
his
delicate
ear
,
and
while
we
sat
at
our
first
*NL*
tiffin
together
he
began
to
find
fault
in
a
nasty
manner
with
this
and
*NL*
that
in
the
ship
.
I
never
heard
such
a
voice
out
of
a
Punch
and
Judy
*NL*
show
.
I
set
my
teeth
hard
,
and
glued
my
eyes
to
my
plate
,
and
held
my
*NL*
peace
as
long
as
I
could
;
but
at
last
I
had
to
say
something
.
Up
*NL*
he
jumps
tiptoeing
,
ruffling
all
his
pretty
plumes
,
like
a
little
*NL*
fighting-cock
.
`
You
'll
find
you
have
a
different
person
to
deal
with
*NL*
than
the
late
Captain
Brierly
.
'
`
I
've
found
it
,
'
says
I
,
very
glum
,
but
*NL*
pretending
to
be
mighty
busy
with
my
steak
.
`
You
are
an
old
ruffian
,
*NL*
Mister
--
aw
--
Jones
;
and
what
's
more
,
you
are
known
for
an
old
ruffian
*NL*
in
the
employ
,
'
he
squeaks
at
me
.
The
damned
bottle-washers
stood
about
*NL*
listening
with
their
mouths
stretched
from
ear
to
ear
.
'
I
may
be
a
hard
*NL*
case
,
'
answers
I
,
`
but
I
ai
n't
so
far
gone
as
to
put
up
with
the
sight
*NL*
of
you
sitting
in
Captain
Brierly
's
chair
.
'
With
that
I
lay
down
my
*NL*
knife
and
fork
.
`
You
would
like
to
sit
in
it
yourself
--
that
's
where
the
*NL*
shoe
pinches
,
'
he
sneers
.
I
left
the
saloon
,
got
my
rags
together
,
and
*NL*
was
on
the
quay
with
all
my
dunnage
about
my
feet
before
the
*NL*
stevedores
had
turned
to
again
.
Yes
.
Adrift
--
on
shore
--
after
ten
years
'
*NL*
service
--
and
with
a
poor
woman
and
four
children
six
thousand
miles
*NL*
off
depending
on
my
half-pay
for
every
mouthful
they
ate
.
Yes
,
sir
!
*NL*
I
chucked
it
rather
than
hear
Captain
Brierly
abused
.
He
left
me
his
*NL*
night-glasses
--
here
they
are
;
and
he
wished
me
to
take
care
of
the
*NL*
dog
--
here
he
is
.
Hallo
,
Rover
,
poor
boy
.
Where
's
the
captain
,
Rover
?
''
*NL*
The
dog
looked
up
at
us
with
mournful
yellow
eyes
,
gave
one
desolate
*NL*
bark
,
and
crept
under
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
this
was
taking
place
,
more
than
two
years
afterwards
,
on
board
*NL*
that
nautical
ruin
the
Fire-Queen
this
Jones
had
got
charge
of
--
quite
*NL*
by
a
funny
accident
,
too
--
from
Matherson
--
mad
Matherson
they
generally
*NL*
called
him
--
the
same
who
used
to
hang
out
in
Hai-phong
,
you
know
,
before
*NL*
the
occupation
days
.
The
old
chap
snuffled
on
--
*NL*
*NL*

``
Ay
,
sir
,
Captain
Brierly
will
be
remembered
here

if
there

no

place

I
wrote
fully
to
his
father
and
did
not
get
a
word
in
*NL*
reply
--
neither
Thank
you

not

`
The
sight
of
that
watery-eyed
old
Jones
mopping
his
bald
head
with
a
*NL*
red
cotton
handkerchief
,
the
sorrowing
yelp
of
the
dog
,
the
squalor
of
*NL*
that
fly-blown
cuddy
which
was
the
only
shrine
of
his
memory
,
threw
a
*NL*
veil
of
inexpressibly
mean
pathos
over
Brierly
's
remembered
figure
,
the
*NL*
posthumous
revenge
of
fate
for
that
belief
in
his
own
splendour
which
*NL*
had
almost
cheated
his
life
of
its
legitimate
terrors
.
Almost
!
Perhaps
*NL*
wholly
.
Who
can
tell
what
flattering
view
he
had
induced
himself
to
take
*NL*
of
his
own
suicide
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Why
did
he
commit
the
rash
act
,
Captain
Marlow
--
can
you
think
?
''
asked
*NL*
Jones
,
pressing
his
palms
together
.
``
Why
?
It
beats
me
!
Why
?
''
He
slapped
*NL*
his
low
and
wrinkled
forehead
.
``
If
he
had
been
poor
and
old
and
in
*NL*
debt
--
and
never
a
show
--
or
else
mad

But
he
was
n't
of
the
kind
that
*NL*
goes
mad
,
not
he
.
You
trust
me
.
What
a
mate
do
n't
know
about
his
skipper
*NL*
is
n't
worth
knowing

Young
,
healthy
,
well
off
,
no
cares
...
I
sit
*NL*
here
sometimes
thinking
,
thinking
,
till
my
head
fairly
begins
to
buzz
.
*NL*
There
was
some
reason
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
may
depend
on
it
,
Captain
Jones

said
I
,
``
it
was
n't
anything
that
*NL*
would
have
disturbed
much
either
of
us
two

I
said
;
and
then
,
as
if
*NL*
a
light
had
been
flashed
into
the
muddle
of
his
brain
,
poor
old
Jones
*NL*
found
a
last
word
of
amazing
profundity
.
He
blew
his
nose
,
nodding
at
me
*NL*
dolefully
:
``
Ay
,
ay
!
neither
you
nor
I
,

had
ever
thought
so
much
of
*NL*
ourselves

''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
the
recollection
of
my
last
conversation
with
Brierly
is
*NL*
tinged
with
the
knowledge
of
his
end
that
followed
so
close
upon
it
.
I
*NL*
spoke
with
him
for
the
last
time
during
the
progress
of
the
inquiry
.
It
*NL*
was
after
the
first
adjournment
,
and
he
came
up
with
me
in
the
street
.
*NL*
He
was
in
a
state
of
irritation
,
which
I
noticed
with
surprise
,
his
*NL*
usual
behaviour
when
he
condescended
to
converse
being
perfectly
*NL*
cool
,
with
a
trace
of
amused
tolerance
,
as
if
the
existence
of
his
*NL*
interlocutor
had
been
a
rather
good
joke
.
``
They
caught
me
for
that
*NL*
inquiry
,
you
see
,
''
he
began
,
and
for
a
while
enlarged
complainingly
upon
*NL*
the
inconveniences
of
daily
attendance
in
court
.
``
And
goodness
knows
how
*NL*
long
it
will
last
.
Three
days
,
I
suppose
.
''
I
heard
him
out
in
silence
;
*NL*
in
my
then
opinion
it
was
a
way
as
good
as
another
of
putting
on
side
.
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
it
?
It
is
the
stupidest
set-out
you
can
imagine
,
''
he
*NL*
pursued
hotly
.
I
remarked
that
there
was
no
option
.
He
interrupted
me
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
pent-up
violence
.
``
I
feel
like
a
fool
all
the
time
.
''
I
*NL*
looked
up
at
him
.
This
was
going
very
far
--
for
Brierly
--
when
talking
of
*NL*
Brierly
.
He
stopped
short
,
and
seizing
the
lapel
of
my
coat
,
gave
it
*NL*
a
slight
tug
.
``
Why
are
we
tormenting
that
young
chap
?
''
he
asked
.
This
*NL*
question
chimed
in
so
well
to
the
tolling
of
a
certain
thought
of
mine
*NL*
that
,
with
the
image
of
the
absconding
renegade
in
my
eye
,
I
answered
*NL*
at
once
,
``
Hanged
if
I
know
,
unless
it
be
that
he
lets
you
.
''
I
was
*NL*
astonished
to
see
him
fall
into
line
,
so
to
speak
,
with
that
utterance
,
*NL*
which
ought
to
have
been
tolerably
cryptic
.
He
said
angrily
,
``
Why
,
yes
.
*NL*
Ca
n't
he
see
that
wretched
skipper
of
his
has
cleared
out
?
What
does
he
*NL*
expect
to
happen
?
Nothing
can
save
him
.
He
's
done
for
.
''
We
walked
on
*NL*
in
silence
a
few
steps
.
``
Why
eat
all
that
dirt
?
''
he
exclaimed
,
with
an
*NL*
oriental
energy
of
expression
--
about
the
only
sort
of
energy
you
can
*NL*
find
a
trace
of
east
of
the
fiftieth
meridian
.
I
wondered
greatly
at
the
*NL*
direction
of
his
thoughts
,
but
now
I
strongly
suspect
it
was
strictly
in
*NL*
character
:
at
bottom
poor
Brierly
must
have
been
thinking
of
himself
.
*NL*
I
pointed
out
to
him
that
the
skipper
of
the
Patna
was
known
to
have
*NL*
feathered
his
nest
pretty
well
,
and
could
procure
almost
anywhere
the
*NL*
means
of
getting
away
.
With
Jim
it
was
otherwise
:
the
Government
was
*NL*
keeping
him
in
the
Sailors
'
Home
for
the
time
being
,
and
probably
he
*NL*
had
n't
a
penny
in
his
pocket
to
bless
himself
with
.
It
costs
some
money
*NL*
to
run
away
.
``
Does
it
?
Not
always
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
bitter
laugh
,
and
*NL*
to
some
further
remark
of
mine
--
``
Well
,
then
,
let
him
creep
twenty
feet
*NL*
underground
and
stay
there
!
By
heavens
!
_
I
_
would
.
''
I
do
n't
know
why
his
*NL*
tone
provoked
me
,
and
I
said
,
``
There
is
a
kind
of
courage
in
facing
*NL*
it
out
as
he
does
,
knowing
very
well
that
if
he
went
away
nobody
would
*NL*
trouble
to
run
after
him
.
''
``
Courage
be
hanged
!
''
growled
Brierly
.
``
That
*NL*
sort
of
courage
is
of
no
use
to
keep
a
man
straight
,
and
I
do
n't
care
*NL*
a
snap
for
such
courage
.
If
you
were
to
say
it
was
a
kind
of
cowardice
*NL*
now
--
of
softness
.
I
tell
you
what
,
I
will
put
up
two
hundred
rupees
if
*NL*
you
put
up
another
hundred
and
undertake
to
make
the
beggar
clear
out
*NL*
early
to-morrow
morning
.
The
fellow
's
a
gentleman
if
he
ai
n't
fit
to
*NL*
be
touched
--
he
will
understand
.
He
must
!
This
infernal
publicity
is
too
*NL*
shocking
:
there
he
sits
while
all
these
confounded
natives
,
serangs
,
*NL*
lascars
,
quartermasters
,
are
giving
evidence
that
's
enough
to
burn
a
man
*NL*
to
ashes
with
shame
.
This
is
abominable
.
Why
,
Marlow
,
do
n't
you
think
,
*NL*
do
n't
you
feel
,
that
this
is
abominable
;
do
n't
you
now
--
come
--
as
a
*NL*
seaman
?
If
he
went
away
all
this
would
stop
at
once
.
''
Brierly
said
these
*NL*
words
with
a
most
unusual
animation
,
and
made
as
if
to
reach
after
his
*NL*
pocket-book
.
I
restrained
him
,
and
declared
coldly
that
the
cowardice
*NL*
of
these
four
men
did
not
seem
to
me
a
matter
of
such
great
importance
.
*NL*
``
And
you
call
yourself
a
seaman
,
I
suppose
,
''
he
pronounced
angrily
.
I
*NL*
said
that
's
what
I
called
myself
,
and
I
hoped
I
was
too
.
He
heard
me
*NL*
out
,
and
made
a
gesture
with
his
big
arm
that
seemed
to
deprive
me
of
*NL*
my
individuality
,
to
push
me
away
into
the
crowd
.
``
The
worst
of
it
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
is
that
all
you
fellows
have
no
sense
of
dignity
;
you
do
n't
think
*NL*
enough
of
what
you
are
supposed
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
had
been
walking
slowly
meantime
,
and
now
stopped
opposite
the
*NL*
harbour
office
,
in
sight
of
the
very
spot
from
which
the
immense
captain
*NL*
of
the
Patna
had
vanished
as
utterly
as
a
tiny
feather
blown
away
in
a
*NL*
hurricane
.
I
smiled
.
Brierly
went
on
:
``
This
is
a
disgrace
.
We
've
got
all
*NL*
kinds
amongst
us
--
some
anointed
scoundrels
in
the
lot
;
but
,
hang
it
,
we
*NL*
must
preserve
professional
decency
or
we
become
no
better
than
so
many
*NL*
tinkers
going
about
loose
.
We
are
trusted
.
Do
you
understand
?
--
trusted
!
*NL*
Frankly
,
I
do
n't
care
a
snap
for
all
the
pilgrims
that
ever
came
out
of
*NL*
Asia
,
but
a
decent
man
would
not
have
behaved
like
this
to
a
full
cargo
*NL*
of
old
rags
in
bales
.
We
are
n't
an
organised
body
of
men
,
and
the
only
*NL*
thing
that
holds
us
together
is
just
the
name
for
that
kind
of
decency
.
*NL*
Such
an
affair
destroys
one
's
confidence
.
A
man
may
go
pretty
near
*NL*
through
his
whole
sea-life
without
any
call
to
show
a
stiff
upper
lip
.
*NL*
But
when
the
call
comes
...
Aha
!
...
If
I
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
broke
off
,
and
in
a
changed
tone
,
``
I
'll
give
you
two
hundred
rupees
*NL*
now
,
Marlow
,
and
you
just
talk
to
that
chap
.
Confound
him
!
I
wish
he
had
*NL*
never
come
out
here
.
Fact
is
,
I
rather
think
some
of
my
people
know
his
.
*NL*
The
old
man
's
a
parson
,
and
I
remember
now
I
met
him
once
when
staying
*NL*
with
my
cousin
in
Essex
last
year
.
If
I
am
not
mistaken
,
the
old
*NL*
chap
seemed
rather
to
fancy
his
sailor
son
.
Horrible
.
I
ca
n't
do
it
*NL*
myself
--
but
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
,
apropos
of
Jim
,
I
had
a
glimpse
of
the
real
Brierly
a
few
days
*NL*
before
he
committed
his
reality
and
his
sham
together
to
the
keeping
of
*NL*
the
sea
.
Of
course
I
declined
to
meddle
.
The
tone
of
this
last
``
but
*NL*
you
''
-LRB-
poor
Brierly
could
n't
help
it
-RRB-
,
that
seemed
to
imply
I
was
no
*NL*
more
noticeable
than
an
insect
,
caused
me
to
look
at
the
proposal
with
*NL*
indignation
,
and
on
account
of
that
provocation
,
or
for
some
other
*NL*
reason
,
I
became
positive
in
my
mind
that
the
inquiry
was
a
severe
*NL*
punishment
to
that
Jim
,
and
that
his
facing
it
--
practically
of
his
own
*NL*
free
will
--
was
a
redeeming
feature
in
his
abominable
case
.
I
had
n't
been
*NL*
so
sure
of
it
before
.
Brierly
went
off
in
a
huff
.
At
the
time
his
state
*NL*
of
mind
was
more
of
a
mystery
to
me
than
it
is
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Next
day
,
coming
into
court
late
,
I
sat
by
myself
.
Of
course
I
could
*NL*
not
forget
the
conversation
I
had
with
Brierly
,
and
now
I
had
them
both
*NL*
under
my
eyes
.
The
demeanour
of
one
suggested
gloomy
impudence
and
of
*NL*
the
other
a
contemptuous
boredom
;
yet
one
attitude
might
not
have
been
*NL*
truer
than
the
other
,
and
I
was
aware
that
one
was
not
true
.
Brierly
was
*NL*
not
bored
--
he
was
exasperated
;
and
if
so
,
then
Jim
might
not
have
been
*NL*
impudent
.
According
to
my
theory
he
was
not
.
I
imagined
he
was
hopeless
.
*NL*
Then
it
was
that
our
glances
met
.
They
met
,
and
the
look
he
gave
me
was
*NL*
discouraging
of
any
intention
I
might
have
had
to
speak
to
him
.
Upon
*NL*
either
hypothesis
--
insolence
or
despair
--
I
felt
I
could
be
of
no
use
to
*NL*
him
.
This
was
the
second
day
of
the
proceedings
.
Very
soon
after
that
*NL*
exchange
of
glances
the
inquiry
was
adjourned
again
to
the
next
day
.
The
*NL*
white
men
began
to
troop
out
at
once
.
Jim
had
been
told
to
stand
down
*NL*
some
time
before
,
and
was
able
to
leave
amongst
the
first
.
I
saw
his
*NL*
broad
shoulders
and
his
head
outlined
in
the
light
of
the
door
,
and
*NL*
while
I
made
my
way
slowly
out
talking
with
some
one
--
some
stranger
who
*NL*
had
addressed
me
casually
--
I
could
see
him
from
within
the
court-room
*NL*
resting
both
elbows
on
the
balustrade
of
the
verandah
and
turning
his
*NL*
back
on
the
small
stream
of
people
trickling
down
the
few
steps
.
There
*NL*
was
a
murmur
of
voices
and
a
shuffle
of
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
next
case
was
that
of
assault
and
battery
committed
upon
a
*NL*
money-lender
,
I
believe
;
and
the
defendant
--
a
venerable
villager
with
a
*NL*
straight
white
beard
--
sat
on
a
mat
just
outside
the
door
with
his
sons
,
*NL*
daughters
,
sons-in-law
,
their
wives
,
and
,
I
should
think
,
half
the
*NL*
population
of
his
village
besides
,
squatting
or
standing
around
him
.
A
*NL*
slim
dark
woman
,
with
part
of
her
back
and
one
black
shoulder
bared
,
*NL*
and
with
a
thin
gold
ring
in
her
nose
,
suddenly
began
to
talk
in
a
*NL*
high-pitched
,
shrewish
tone
.
The
man
with
me
instinctively
looked
up
*NL*
at
her
.
We
were
then
just
through
the
door
,
passing
behind
Jim
's
burly
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Whether
those
villagers
had
brought
the
yellow
dog
with
them
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
.
Anyhow
,
a
dog
was
there
,
weaving
himself
in
and
out
amongst
*NL*
people
's
legs
in
that
mute
stealthy
way
native
dogs
have
,
and
my
*NL*
companion
stumbled
over
him
.
The
dog
leaped
away
without
a
sound
;
the
*NL*
man
,
raising
his
voice
a
little
,
said
with
a
slow
laugh
,
``
Look
at
that
*NL*
wretched
cur
,
''
and
directly
afterwards
we
became
separated
by
a
lot
of
*NL*
people
pushing
in
.
I
stood
back
for
a
moment
against
the
wall
while
the
*NL*
stranger
managed
to
get
down
the
steps
and
disappeared
.
I
saw
Jim
spin
*NL*
round
.
He
made
a
step
forward
and
barred
my
way
.
We
were
alone
;
he
*NL*
glared
at
me
with
an
air
of
stubborn
resolution
.
I
became
aware
I
was
*NL*
being
held
up
,
so
to
speak
,
as
if
in
a
wood
.
The
verandah
was
empty
by
*NL*
then
,
the
noise
and
movement
in
court
had
ceased
:
a
great
silence
fell
*NL*
upon
the
building
,
in
which
,
somewhere
far
within
,
an
oriental
voice
*NL*
began
to
whine
abjectly
.
The
dog
,
in
the
very
act
of
trying
to
sneak
in
*NL*
at
the
door
,
sat
down
hurriedly
to
hunt
for
fleas
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Did
you
speak
to
me
?
''
asked
Jim
very
low
,
and
bending
forward
,
not
so
*NL*
much
towards
me
but
at
me
,
if
you
know
what
I
mean
.
I
said
``
No
''
at
once
.
*NL*
Something
in
the
sound
of
that
quiet
tone
of
his
warned
me
to
be
on
my
*NL*
defence
.
I
watched
him
.
It
was
very
much
like
a
meeting
in
a
wood
,
only
*NL*
more
uncertain
in
its
issue
,
since
he
could
possibly
want
neither
my
*NL*
money
nor
my
life
--
nothing
that
I
could
simply
give
up
or
defend
with
*NL*
a
clear
conscience
.
``
You
say
you
did
n't
,
''
he
said
,
very
sombre
.
``
But
I
*NL*
heard
.
''
``
Some
mistake
,
''
I
protested
,
utterly
at
a
loss
,
and
never
taking
*NL*
my
eyes
off
him
.
To
watch
his
face
was
like
watching
a
darkening
sky
*NL*
before
a
clap
of
thunder
,
shade
upon
shade
imperceptibly
coming
on
,
the
*NL*
doom
growing
mysteriously
intense
in
the
calm
of
maturing
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
As
far
as
I
know
,
I
have
n't
opened
my
lips
in
your
hearing
,
''
I
*NL*
affirmed
with
perfect
truth
.
I
was
getting
a
little
angry
,
too
,
at
the
*NL*
absurdity
of
this
encounter
.
It
strikes
me
now
I
have
never
in
my
life
*NL*
been
so
near
a
beating
--
I
mean
it
literally
;
a
beating
with
fists
.
I
*NL*
suppose
I
had
some
hazy
prescience
of
that
eventuality
being
in
the
*NL*
air
.
Not
that
he
was
actively
threatening
me
.
On
the
contrary
,
he
was
*NL*
strangely
passive
--
do
n't
you
know
?
but
he
was
lowering
,
and
,
though
not
*NL*
exceptionally
big
,
he
looked
generally
fit
to
demolish
a
wall
.
The
*NL*
most
reassuring
symptom
I
noticed
was
a
kind
of
slow
and
ponderous
*NL*
hesitation
,
which
I
took
as
a
tribute
to
the
evident
sincerity
of
my
*NL*
manner
and
of
my
tone
.
We
faced
each
other
.
In
the
court
the
assault
*NL*
case
was
proceeding
.
I
caught
the
words
:
``
Well
--
buffalo
--
stick
--
in
the
*NL*
greatness
of
my
fear
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
did
you
mean
by
staring
at
me
all
the
morning
?
''
said
Jim
at
last
.
*NL*
He
looked
up
and
looked
down
again
.
``
Did
you
expect
us
all
to
sit
with
*NL*
downcast
eyes
out
of
regard
for
your
susceptibilities
?
''
I
retorted
*NL*
sharply
.
I
was
not
going
to
submit
meekly
to
any
of
his
nonsense
.
He
*NL*
raised
his
eyes
again
,
and
this
time
continued
to
look
me
straight
*NL*
in
the
face
.
``
No
.
That
's
all
right
,
''
he
pronounced
with
an
air
of
*NL*
deliberating
with
himself
upon
the
truth
of
this
statement
--
``
that
's
all
*NL*
right
.
I
am
going
through
with
that
.
Only
''
--
and
there
he
spoke
a
little
*NL*
faster
--
``
I
wo
n't
let
any
man
call
me
names
outside
this
court
.
There
was
*NL*
a
fellow
with
you
.
You
spoke
to
him
--
oh
yes
--
I
know
;
't
is
all
very
fine
.
*NL*
You
spoke
to
him
,
but
you
meant
me
to
hear
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
assured
him
he
was
under
some
extraordinary
delusion
.
I
had
no
*NL*
conception
how
it
came
about
.
``
You
thought
I
would
be
afraid
to
resent
*NL*
this
,
''
he
said
,
with
just
a
faint
tinge
of
bitterness
.
I
was
interested
*NL*
enough
to
discern
the
slightest
shades
of
expression
,
but
I
was
not
in
*NL*
the
least
enlightened
;
yet
I
do
n't
know
what
in
these
words
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
just
the
intonation
of
that
phrase
,
induced
me
suddenly
to
make
all
*NL*
possible
allowances
for
him
.
I
ceased
to
be
annoyed
at
my
unexpected
*NL*
predicament
.
It
was
some
mistake
on
his
part
;
he
was
blundering
,
and
I
*NL*
had
an
intuition
that
the
blunder
was
of
an
odious
,
of
an
unfortunate
*NL*
nature
.
I
was
anxious
to
end
this
scene
on
grounds
of
decency
,
just
as
*NL*
one
is
anxious
to
cut
short
some
unprovoked
and
abominable
confidence
.
*NL*
The
funniest
part
was
,
that
in
the
midst
of
all
these
considerations
*NL*
of
the
higher
order
I
was
conscious
of
a
certain
trepidation
as
to
*NL*
the
possibility
--
nay
,
likelihood
--
of
this
encounter
ending
in
some
*NL*
disreputable
brawl
which
could
not
possibly
be
explained
,
and
would
make
*NL*
me
ridiculous
.
I
did
not
hanker
after
a
three
days
'
celebrity
as
the
man
*NL*
who
got
a
black
eye
or
something
of
the
sort
from
the
mate
of
the
Patna
.
*NL*
He
,
in
all
probability
,
did
not
care
what
he
did
,
or
at
any
rate
would
*NL*
be
fully
justified
in
his
own
eyes
.
It
took
no
magician
to
see
he
was
*NL*
amazingly
angry
about
something
,
for
all
his
quiet
and
even
torpid
*NL*
demeanour
.
I
do
n't
deny
I
was
extremely
desirous
to
pacify
him
at
all
*NL*
costs
,
had
I
only
known
what
to
do
.
But
I
did
n't
know
,
as
you
may
well
*NL*
imagine
.
It
was
a
blackness
without
a
single
gleam
.
We
confronted
each
*NL*
other
in
silence
.
He
hung
fire
for
about
fifteen
seconds
,
then
made
a
*NL*
step
nearer
,
and
I
made
ready
to
ward
off
a
blow
,
though
I
do
n't
think
I
*NL*
moved
a
muscle
.
``
If
you
were
as
big
as
two
men
and
as
strong
as
six
,
''
*NL*
he
said
very
softly
,
``
I
would
tell
you
what
I
think
of
you
.
You
...
''
*NL*
``
Stop
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
This
checked
him
for
a
second
.
``
Before
you
tell
me
*NL*
what
you
think
of
me
,
''
I
went
on
quickly
,
``
will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
*NL*
it
is
I
've
said
or
done
?
''
During
the
pause
that
ensued
he
surveyed
me
*NL*
with
indignation
,
while
I
made
supernatural
efforts
of
memory
,
in
which
*NL*
I
was
hindered
by
the
oriental
voice
within
the
court-room
expostulating
*NL*
with
impassioned
volubility
against
a
charge
of
falsehood
.
Then
we
spoke
*NL*
almost
together
.
``
I
will
soon
show
you
I
am
not
,
''
he
said
,
in
a
tone
*NL*
suggestive
of
a
crisis
.
``
I
declare
I
do
n't
know
,
''
I
protested
earnestly
*NL*
at
the
same
time
.
He
tried
to
crush
me
by
the
scorn
of
his
glance
.
*NL*
``
Now
that
you
see
I
am
not
afraid
you
try
to
crawl
out
of
it
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Who
's
a
cur
now
--
hey
?
''
Then
,
at
last
,
I
understood
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
been
scanning
my
features
as
though
looking
for
a
place
where
*NL*
he
would
plant
his
fist
.
``
I
will
allow
no
man
,
''
...
he
mumbled
*NL*
threateningly
.
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
hideous
mistake
;
he
had
given
himself
*NL*
away
utterly
.
I
ca
n't
give
you
an
idea
how
shocked
I
was
.
I
suppose
he
*NL*
saw
some
reflection
of
my
feelings
in
my
face
,
because
his
expression
*NL*
changed
just
a
little
.
``
Good
God
!
''
I
stammered
,
``
you
do
n't
think
*NL*
I
...
''
``
But
I
am
sure
I
've
heard
,
''
he
persisted
,
raising
his
voice
for
*NL*
the
first
time
since
the
beginning
of
this
deplorable
scene
.
Then
with
a
*NL*
shade
of
disdain
he
added
,
``
It
was
n't
you
,
then
?
Very
well
;
I
'll
find
*NL*
the
other
.
''
``
Do
n't
be
a
fool
,
''
I
cried
in
exasperation
;
``
it
was
n't
that
*NL*
at
all
.
''
``
I
've
heard
,
''
he
said
again
with
an
unshaken
and
sombre
*NL*
perseverance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
may
be
those
who
could
have
laughed
at
his
pertinacity
;
I
did
n't
.
*NL*
Oh
,
I
did
n't
!
There
had
never
been
a
man
so
mercilessly
shown
up
by
*NL*
his
own
natural
impulse
.
A
single
word
had
stripped
him
of
his
*NL*
discretion
--
of
that
discretion
which
is
more
necessary
to
the
decencies
*NL*
of
our
inner
being
than
clothing
is
to
the
decorum
of
our
body
.
``
Do
n't
*NL*
be
a
fool
,
''
I
repeated
.
``
But
the
other
man
said
it
,
you
do
n't
deny
*NL*
that
?
''
he
pronounced
distinctly
,
and
looking
in
my
face
without
*NL*
flinching
.
``
No
,
I
do
n't
deny
,
''
said
I
,
returning
his
gaze
.
At
last
his
*NL*
eyes
followed
downwards
the
direction
of
my
pointing
finger
.
He
appeared
*NL*
at
first
uncomprehending
,
then
confounded
,
and
at
last
amazed
and
scared
*NL*
as
though
a
dog
had
been
a
monster
and
he
had
never
seen
a
dog
before
.
*NL*
``
Nobody
dreamt
of
insulting
you
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
contemplated
the
wretched
animal
,
that
moved
no
more
than
an
effigy
:
*NL*
it
sat
with
ears
pricked
and
its
sharp
muzzle
pointed
into
the
doorway
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
snapped
at
a
fly
like
a
piece
of
mechanism
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
looked
at
him
.
The
red
of
his
fair
sunburnt
complexion
deepened
*NL*
suddenly
under
the
down
of
his
cheeks
,
invaded
his
forehead
,
spread
to
*NL*
the
roots
of
his
curly
hair
.
His
ears
became
intensely
crimson
,
and
even
*NL*
the
clear
blue
of
his
eyes
was
darkened
many
shades
by
the
rush
of
blood
*NL*
to
his
head
.
His
lips
pouted
a
little
,
trembling
as
though
he
had
been
*NL*
on
the
point
of
bursting
into
tears
.
I
perceived
he
was
incapable
*NL*
of
pronouncing
a
word
from
the
excess
of
his
humiliation
.
From
*NL*
disappointment
too
--
who
knows
?
Perhaps
he
looked
forward
to
that
*NL*
hammering
he
was
going
to
give
me
for
rehabilitation
,
for
appeasement
?
*NL*
Who
can
tell
what
relief
he
expected
from
this
chance
of
a
row
?
He
*NL*
was
naive
enough
to
expect
anything
;
but
he
had
given
himself
away
for
*NL*
nothing
in
this
case
.
He
had
been
frank
with
himself
--
let
alone
*NL*
with
me
--
in
the
wild
hope
of
arriving
in
that
way
at
some
effective
*NL*
refutation
,
and
the
stars
had
been
ironically
unpropitious
.
He
made
an
*NL*
inarticulate
noise
in
his
throat
like
a
man
imperfectly
stunned
by
a
*NL*
blow
on
the
head
.
It
was
pitiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
catch
up
again
with
him
till
well
outside
the
gate
.
I
had
even
*NL*
to
trot
a
bit
at
the
last
,
but
when
,
out
of
breath
at
his
elbow
,
I
taxed
*NL*
him
with
running
away
,
he
said
,
``
Never
!
''
and
at
once
turned
at
bay
.
I
*NL*
explained
I
never
meant
to
say
he
was
running
away
from
_
me
_
.
``
From
no
*NL*
man
--
from
not
a
single
man
on
earth
,
''
he
affirmed
with
a
stubborn
mien
.
*NL*
I
forbore
to
point
out
the
one
obvious
exception
which
would
hold
good
*NL*
for
the
bravest
of
us
;
I
thought
he
would
find
out
by
himself
very
soon
.
*NL*
He
looked
at
me
patiently
while
I
was
thinking
of
something
to
say
,
but
*NL*
I
could
find
nothing
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
,
and
he
began
to
walk
on
.
*NL*
I
kept
up
,
and
anxious
not
to
lose
him
,
I
said
hurriedly
that
I
could
n't
*NL*
think
of
leaving
him
under
a
false
impression
of
my
--
of
my
--
I
stammered
.
*NL*
The
stupidity
of
the
phrase
appalled
me
while
I
was
trying
to
finish
*NL*
it
,
but
the
power
of
sentences
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
sense
or
the
*NL*
logic
of
their
construction
.
My
idiotic
mumble
seemed
to
please
him
.
He
*NL*
cut
it
short
by
saying
,
with
courteous
placidity
that
argued
an
*NL*
immense
power
of
self-control
or
else
a
wonderful
elasticity
of
*NL*
spirits
--
``
Altogether
my
mistake
.
''
I
marvelled
greatly
at
this
*NL*
expression
:
he
might
have
been
alluding
to
some
trifling
occurrence
.
*NL*
Had
n't
he
understood
its
deplorable
meaning
?
``
You
may
well
forgive
me
,
''
*NL*
he
continued
,
and
went
on
a
little
moodily
,
``
All
these
staring
people
in
*NL*
court
seemed
such
fools
that
--
that
it
might
have
been
as
I
supposed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
opened
suddenly
a
new
view
of
him
to
my
wonder
.
I
looked
at
him
*NL*
curiously
and
met
his
unabashed
and
impenetrable
eyes
.
``
I
ca
n't
put
up
*NL*
with
this
kind
of
thing
,
''
he
said
,
very
simply
,
``
and
I
do
n't
mean
to
.
In
*NL*
court
it
's
different
;
I
've
got
to
stand
that
--
and
I
can
do
it
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
pretend
I
understood
him
.
The
views
he
let
me
have
of
himself
*NL*
were
like
those
glimpses
through
the
shifting
rents
in
a
thick
fog
--
bits
*NL*
of
vivid
and
vanishing
detail
,
giving
no
connected
idea
of
the
general
*NL*
aspect
of
a
country
.
They
fed
one
's
curiosity
without
satisfying
it
;
*NL*
they
were
no
good
for
purposes
of
orientation
.
Upon
the
whole
he
was
*NL*
misleading
.
That
's
how
I
summed
him
up
to
myself
after
he
left
me
late
*NL*
in
the
evening
.
I
had
been
staying
at
the
Malabar
House
for
a
few
days
,
*NL*
and
on
my
pressing
invitation
he
dined
with
me
there
.

CHAPTER
7
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
outward-bound
mail-boat
had
come
in
that
afternoon
,
and
the
*NL*
big
dining-room
of
the
hotel
was
more
than
half
full
of
people
with
*NL*
a-hundred-pounds-round-the-world
tickets
in
their
pockets
.
There
were
*NL*
married
couples
looking
domesticated
and
bored
with
each
other
in
the
*NL*
midst
of
their
travels
;
there
were
small
parties
and
large
parties
,
*NL*
and
lone
individuals
dining
solemnly
or
feasting
boisterously
,
but
all
*NL*
thinking
,
conversing
,
joking
,
or
scowling
as
was
their
wont
at
home
;
*NL*
and
just
as
intelligently
receptive
of
new
impressions
as
their
trunks
*NL*
upstairs
.
Henceforth
they
would
be
labelled
as
having
passed
through
*NL*
this
and
that
place
,
and
so
would
be
their
luggage
.
They
would
cherish
*NL*
this
distinction
of
their
persons
,
and
preserve
the
gummed
tickets
on
*NL*
their
portmanteaus
as
documentary
evidence
,
as
the
only
permanent
trace
*NL*
of
their
improving
enterprise
.
The
dark-faced
servants
tripped
without
*NL*
noise
over
the
vast
and
polished
floor
;
now
and
then
a
girl
's
laugh
*NL*
would
be
heard
,
as
innocent
and
empty
as
her
mind
,
or
,
in
a
sudden
hush
*NL*
of
crockery
,
a
few
words
in
an
affected
drawl
from
some
wit
embroidering
*NL*
for
the
benefit
of
a
grinning
tableful
the
last
funny
story
of
shipboard
*NL*
scandal
.
Two
nomadic
old
maids
,
dressed
up
to
kill
,
worked
acrimoniously
*NL*
through
the
bill
of
fare
,
whispering
to
each
other
with
faded
lips
,
*NL*
wooden-faced
and
bizarre
,
like
two
sumptuous
scarecrows
.
A
little
wine
*NL*
opened
Jim
's
heart
and
loosened
his
tongue
.
His
appetite
was
good
,
too
,
*NL*
I
noticed
.
He
seemed
to
have
buried
somewhere
the
opening
episode
of
*NL*
our
acquaintance
.
It
was
like
a
thing
of
which
there
would
be
no
more
*NL*
question
in
this
world
.
And
all
the
time
I
had
before
me
these
blue
,
*NL*
boyish
eyes
looking
straight
into
mine
,
this
young
face
,
these
capable
*NL*
shoulders
,
the
open
bronzed
forehead
with
a
white
line
under
the
roots
*NL*
of
clustering
fair
hair
,
this
appearance
appealing
at
sight
to
all
*NL*
my
sympathies
:
this
frank
aspect
,
the
artless
smile
,
the
youthful
*NL*
seriousness
.
He
was
of
the
right
sort
;
he
was
one
of
us
.
He
talked
*NL*
soberly
,
with
a
sort
of
composed
unreserve
,
and
with
a
quiet
bearing
*NL*
that
might
have
been
the
outcome
of
manly
self-control
,
of
impudence
,
of
*NL*
callousness
,
of
a
colossal
unconsciousness
,
of
a
gigantic
deception
.
Who
*NL*
can
tell
!
From
our
tone
we
might
have
been
discussing
a
third
person
,
*NL*
a
football
match
,
last
year
's
weather
.
My
mind
floated
in
a
sea
of
*NL*
conjectures
till
the
turn
of
the
conversation
enabled
me
,
without
being
*NL*
offensive
,
to
remark
that
,
upon
the
whole
,
this
inquiry
must
have
been
*NL*
pretty
trying
to
him
.
He
darted
his
arm
across
the
tablecloth
,
and
*NL*
clutching
my
hand
by
the
side
of
my
plate
,
glared
fixedly
.
I
was
*NL*
startled
.
``
It
must
be
awfully
hard
,
''
I
stammered
,
confused
by
this
*NL*
display
of
speechless
feeling
.
``
It
is
--
hell
,
''
he
burst
out
in
a
muffled
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
movement
and
these
words
caused
two
well-groomed
male
*NL*
globe-trotters
at
a
neighbouring
table
to
look
up
in
alarm
from
their
*NL*
iced
pudding
.
I
rose
,
and
we
passed
into
the
front
gallery
for
coffee
*NL*
and
cigars
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
On
little
octagon
tables
candles
burned
in
glass
globes
;
clumps
of
*NL*
stiff-leaved
plants
separated
sets
of
cosy
wicker
chairs
;
and
between
*NL*
the
pairs
of
columns
,
whose
reddish
shafts
caught
in
a
long
row
the
*NL*
sheen
from
the
tall
windows
,
the
night
,
glittering
and
sombre
,
seemed
*NL*
to
hang
like
a
splendid
drapery
.
The
riding
lights
of
ships
winked
afar
*NL*
like
setting
stars
,
and
the
hills
across
the
roadstead
resembled
rounded
*NL*
black
masses
of
arrested
thunder-clouds
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
could
n't
clear
out
,
''
Jim
began
.
``
The
skipper
did
--
that
's
all
very
*NL*
well
for
him
.
I
could
n't
,
and
I
would
n't
.
They
all
got
out
of
it
in
one
*NL*
way
or
another
,
but
it
would
n't
do
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
listened
with
concentrated
attention
,
not
daring
to
stir
in
my
chair
;
*NL*
I
wanted
to
know
--
and
to
this
day
I
do
n't
know
,
I
can
only
guess
.
He
*NL*
would
be
confident
and
depressed
all
in
the
same
breath
,
as
if
some
*NL*
conviction
of
innate
blamelessness
had
checked
the
truth
writhing
within
*NL*
him
at
every
turn
.
He
began
by
saying
,
in
the
tone
in
which
a
man
would
*NL*
admit
his
inability
to
jump
a
twenty-foot
wall
,
that
he
could
never
*NL*
go
home
now
;
and
this
declaration
recalled
to
my
mind
what
Brierly
had
*NL*
said
,
``
that
the
old
parson
in
Essex
seemed
to
fancy
his
sailor
son
not
a
*NL*
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ca
n't
tell
you
whether
Jim
knew
he
was
especially
``
fancied
,
''
but
the
*NL*
tone
of
his
references
to
``
my
Dad
''
was
calculated
to
give
me
a
notion
*NL*
that
the
good
old
rural
dean
was
about
the
finest
man
that
ever
had
been
*NL*
worried
by
the
cares
of
a
large
family
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
.
*NL*
This
,
though
never
stated
,
was
implied
with
an
anxiety
that
there
should
*NL*
be
no
mistake
about
it
,
which
was
really
very
true
and
charming
,
but
*NL*
added
a
poignant
sense
of
lives
far
off
to
the
other
elements
of
the
*NL*
story
.
``
He
has
seen
it
all
in
the
home
papers
by
this
time
,
''
said
Jim
.
*NL*
``
I
can
never
face
the
poor
old
chap
.
''
I
did
not
dare
to
lift
my
eyes
*NL*
at
this
till
I
heard
him
add
,
``
I
could
never
explain
.
He
would
n't
*NL*
understand
.
''
Then
I
looked
up
.
He
was
smoking
reflectively
,
and
after
*NL*
a
moment
,
rousing
himself
,
began
to
talk
again
.
He
discovered
at
once
*NL*
a
desire
that
I
should
not
confound
him
with
his
partners
in
--
in
crime
,
*NL*
let
us
call
it
.
He
was
not
one
of
them
;
he
was
altogether
of
another
*NL*
sort
.
I
gave
no
sign
of
dissent
.
I
had
no
intention
,
for
the
sake
of
*NL*
barren
truth
,
to
rob
him
of
the
smallest
particle
of
any
saving
grace
*NL*
that
would
come
in
his
way
.
I
did
n't
know
how
much
of
it
he
believed
*NL*
himself
.
I
did
n't
know
what
he
was
playing
up
to
--
if
he
was
playing
up
*NL*
to
anything
at
all
--
and
I
suspect
he
did
not
know
either
;
for
it
is
my
*NL*
belief
no
man
ever
understands
quite
his
own
artful
dodges
to
escape
*NL*
from
the
grim
shadow
of
self-knowledge
.
I
made
no
sound
all
the
time
*NL*
he
was
wondering
what
he
had
better
do
after
``
that
stupid
inquiry
was
*NL*
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Apparently
he
shared
Brierly
's
contemptuous
opinion
of
these
*NL*
proceedings
ordained
by
law
.
He
would
not
know
where
to
turn
,
he
*NL*
confessed
,
clearly
thinking
aloud
rather
than
talking
to
me
.
Certificate
*NL*
gone
,
career
broken
,
no
money
to
get
away
,
no
work
that
he
could
obtain
*NL*
as
far
as
he
could
see
.
At
home
he
could
perhaps
get
something
;
but
it
*NL*
meant
going
to
his
people
for
help
,
and
that
he
would
not
do
.
He
*NL*
saw
nothing
for
it
but
ship
before
the
mast
--
could
get
perhaps
a
*NL*
quartermaster
's
billet
in
some
steamer
.
Would
do
for
a
quartermaster
.
*NL*
...
``
Do
you
think
you
would
?
''
I
asked
pitilessly
.
He
jumped
up
,
and
*NL*
going
to
the
stone
balustrade
looked
out
into
the
night
.
In
a
moment
he
*NL*
was
back
,
towering
above
my
chair
with
his
youthful
face
clouded
yet
by
*NL*
the
pain
of
a
conquered
emotion
.
He
had
understood
very
well
I
did
not
*NL*
doubt
his
ability
to
steer
a
ship
.
In
a
voice
that
quavered
a
bit
he
*NL*
asked
me
why
did
I
say
that
?
I
had
been
``
no
end
kind
''
to
him
.
I
had
not
*NL*
even
laughed
at
him
when
--
here
he
began
to
mumble
--
``
that
mistake
,
you
*NL*
know
--
made
a
confounded
ass
of
myself
.
''
I
broke
in
by
saying
rather
*NL*
warmly
that
for
me
such
a
mistake
was
not
a
matter
to
laugh
at
.
He
sat
*NL*
down
and
drank
deliberately
some
coffee
,
emptying
the
small
cup
to
the
*NL*
last
drop
.
``
That
does
not
mean
I
admit
for
a
moment
the
cap
fitted
,
''
*NL*
he
declared
distinctly
.
``
No
?
''
I
said
.
``
No
,
''
he
affirmed
with
quiet
*NL*
decision
.
``
Do
you
know
what
_
you
_
would
have
done
?
Do
you
?
And
you
*NL*
do
n't
think
yourself
''
...
he
gulped
something
...
``
you
do
n't
think
*NL*
yourself
a
--
a
--
cur
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
with
this
--
upon
my
honour
!
--
he
looked
up
at
me
inquisitively
.
It
*NL*
was
a
question
it
appears
--
a
bona
fide
question
!
However
,
he
did
n't
wait
*NL*
for
an
answer
.
Before
I
could
recover
he
went
on
,
with
his
eyes
straight
*NL*
before
him
,
as
if
reading
off
something
written
on
the
body
of
the
*NL*
night
.
``
It
is
all
in
being
ready
.
I
was
n't
;
not
--
not
then
.
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
to
excuse
myself
;
but
I
would
like
to
explain
--
I
would
like
somebody
to
*NL*
understand
--
somebody
--
one
person
at
least
!
You
!
Why
not
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
solemn
,
and
a
little
ridiculous
too
,
as
they
always
are
,
those
*NL*
struggles
of
an
individual
trying
to
save
from
the
fire
his
idea
of
what
*NL*
his
moral
identity
should
be
,
this
precious
notion
of
a
convention
,
only
*NL*
one
of
the
rules
of
the
game
,
nothing
more
,
but
all
the
same
so
terribly
*NL*
effective
by
its
assumption
of
unlimited
power
over
natural
instincts
,
*NL*
by
the
awful
penalties
of
its
failure
.
He
began
his
story
quietly
*NL*
enough
.
On
board
that
Dale
Line
steamer
that
had
picked
up
these
four
*NL*
floating
in
a
boat
upon
the
discreet
sunset
glow
of
the
sea
,
they
had
*NL*
been
after
the
first
day
looked
askance
upon
.
The
fat
skipper
told
some
*NL*
story
,
the
others
had
been
silent
,
and
at
first
it
had
been
accepted
.
*NL*
You
do
n't
cross-examine
poor
castaways
you
had
the
good
luck
to
save
,
*NL*
if
not
from
cruel
death
,
then
at
least
from
cruel
suffering
.
Afterwards
,
*NL*
with
time
to
think
it
over
,
it
might
have
struck
the
officers
of
the
*NL*
Avondale
that
there
was
``
something
fishy
''
in
the
affair
;
but
of
course
*NL*
they
would
keep
their
doubts
to
themselves
.
They
had
picked
up
the
*NL*
captain
,
the
mate
,
and
two
engineers
of
the
steamer
Patna
sunk
at
sea
,
*NL*
and
that
,
very
properly
,
was
enough
for
them
.
I
did
not
ask
Jim
about
*NL*
the
nature
of
his
feelings
during
the
ten
days
he
spent
on
board
.
From
*NL*
the
way
he
narrated
that
part
I
was
at
liberty
to
infer
he
was
partly
*NL*
stunned
by
the
discovery
he
had
made
--
the
discovery
about
himself
--
and
*NL*
no
doubt
was
at
work
trying
to
explain
it
away
to
the
only
man
who
*NL*
was
capable
of
appreciating
all
its
tremendous
magnitude
.
You
must
*NL*
understand
he
did
not
try
to
minimise
its
importance
.
Of
that
I
am
sure
;
*NL*
and
therein
lies
his
distinction
.
As
to
what
sensations
he
experienced
*NL*
when
he
got
ashore
and
heard
the
unforeseen
conclusion
of
the
tale
in
*NL*
which
he
had
taken
such
a
pitiful
part
,
he
told
me
nothing
of
them
,
and
*NL*
it
is
difficult
to
imagine
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
wonder
whether
he
felt
the
ground
cut
from
under
his
feet
?
I
wonder
?
*NL*
But
no
doubt
he
managed
to
get
a
fresh
foothold
very
soon
.
He
was
ashore
*NL*
a
whole
fortnight
waiting
in
the
Sailors
'
Home
,
and
as
there
were
six
or
*NL*
seven
men
staying
there
at
the
time
,
I
had
heard
of
him
a
little
.
*NL*
Their
languid
opinion
seemed
to
be
that
,
in
addition
to
his
other
*NL*
shortcomings
,
he
was
a
sulky
brute
.
He
had
passed
these
days
on
the
*NL*
verandah
,
buried
in
a
long
chair
,
and
coming
out
of
his
place
of
*NL*
sepulture
only
at
meal-times
or
late
at
night
,
when
he
wandered
on
the
*NL*
quays
all
by
himself
,
detached
from
his
surroundings
,
irresolute
and
*NL*
silent
,
like
a
ghost
without
a
home
to
haunt
.
``
I
do
n't
think
I
've
spoken
*NL*
three
words
to
a
living
soul
in
all
that
time
,
''
he
said
,
making
me
very
*NL*
sorry
for
him
;
and
directly
he
added
,
``
One
of
these
fellows
would
have
*NL*
been
sure
to
blurt
out
something
I
had
made
up
my
mind
not
to
put
up
*NL*
with
,
and
I
did
n't
want
a
row
.
No
!
Not
then
.
I
was
too
--
too
...
I
*NL*
had
no
heart
for
it
.
''
``
So
that
bulkhead
held
out
after
all
,
''
I
remarked
*NL*
cheerfully
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
murmured
,
``
it
held
.
And
yet
I
swear
to
you
I
felt
*NL*
it
bulge
under
my
hand
.
''
``
It
's
extraordinary
what
strains
old
iron
will
*NL*
stand
sometimes
,
''
I
said
.
Thrown
back
in
his
seat
,
his
legs
stiffly
out
*NL*
and
arms
hanging
down
,
he
nodded
slightly
several
times
.
You
could
not
*NL*
conceive
a
sadder
spectacle
.
Suddenly
he
lifted
his
head
;
he
sat
up
;
*NL*
he
slapped
his
thigh
.
``
Ah
!
what
a
chance
missed
!
My
God
!
what
a
chance
*NL*
missed
!
''
he
blazed
out
,
but
the
ring
of
the
last
``
missed
''
resembled
a
*NL*
cry
wrung
out
by
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
was
silent
again
with
a
still
,
far-away
look
of
fierce
yearning
*NL*
after
that
missed
distinction
,
with
his
nostrils
for
an
instant
dilated
,
*NL*
sniffing
the
intoxicating
breath
of
that
wasted
opportunity
.
If
you
*NL*
think
I
was
either
surprised
or
shocked
you
do
me
an
injustice
in
more
*NL*
ways
than
one
!
Ah
,
he
was
an
imaginative
beggar
!
He
would
give
himself
*NL*
away
;
he
would
give
himself
up
.
I
could
see
in
his
glance
darted
into
*NL*
the
night
all
his
inner
being
carried
on
,
projected
headlong
into
the
*NL*
fanciful
realm
of
recklessly
heroic
aspirations
.
He
had
no
leisure
to
*NL*
regret
what
he
had
lost
,
he
was
so
wholly
and
naturally
concerned
for
*NL*
what
he
had
failed
to
obtain
.
He
was
very
far
away
from
me
who
watched
*NL*
him
across
three
feet
of
space
.
With
every
instant
he
was
penetrating
*NL*
deeper
into
the
impossible
world
of
romantic
achievements
.
He
got
to
*NL*
the
heart
of
it
at
last
!
A
strange
look
of
beatitude
overspread
his
*NL*
features
,
his
eyes
sparkled
in
the
light
of
the
candle
burning
between
*NL*
us
;
he
positively
smiled
!
He
had
penetrated
to
the
very
heart
--
to
*NL*
the
very
heart
.
It
was
an
ecstatic
smile
that
your
faces
--
or
mine
*NL*
either
--
will
never
wear
,
my
dear
boys
.
I
whisked
him
back
by
saying
,
``
If
*NL*
you
had
stuck
to
the
ship
,
you
mean
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
turned
upon
me
,
his
eyes
suddenly
amazed
and
full
of
pain
,
with
a
*NL*
bewildered
,
startled
,
suffering
face
,
as
though
he
had
tumbled
down
*NL*
from
a
star
.
Neither
you
nor
I
will
ever
look
like
this
on
any
man
.
He
*NL*
shuddered
profoundly
,
as
if
a
cold
finger-tip
had
touched
his
heart
.
*NL*
Last
of
all
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
not
in
a
merciful
mood
.
He
provoked
one
by
his
contradictory
*NL*
indiscretions
.
``
It
is
unfortunate
you
did
n't
know
beforehand
!
''
I
*NL*
said
with
every
unkind
intention
;
but
the
perfidious
shaft
fell
*NL*
harmless
--
dropped
at
his
feet
like
a
spent
arrow
,
as
it
were
,
and
he
did
*NL*
not
think
of
picking
it
up
.
Perhaps
he
had
not
even
seen
it
.
Presently
,
*NL*
lolling
at
ease
,
he
said
,
``
Dash
it
all
!
I
tell
you
it
bulged
.
I
was
*NL*
holding
up
my
lamp
along
the
angle-iron
in
the
lower
deck
when
a
*NL*
flake
of
rust
as
big
as
the
palm
of
my
hand
fell
off
the
plate
,
all
of
*NL*
itself
.
''
He
passed
his
hand
over
his
forehead
.
``
The
thing
stirred
and
*NL*
jumped
off
like
something
alive
while
I
was
looking
at
it
.
''
``
That
made
*NL*
you
feel
pretty
bad
,
''
I
observed
casually
.
``
Do
you
suppose
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
``
that
I
was
thinking
of
myself
,
with
a
hundred
and
sixty
people
at
my
*NL*
back
,
all
fast
asleep
in
that
fore
-
`
tween-deck
alone
--
and
more
of
them
*NL*
aft
;
more
on
the
deck
--
sleeping
--
knowing
nothing
about
it
--
three
times
*NL*
as
many
as
there
were
boats
for
,
even
if
there
had
been
time
?
I
expected
*NL*
to
see
the
iron
open
out
as
I
stood
there
and
the
rush
of
water
going
*NL*
over
them
as
they
lay
...
What
could
I
do
--
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
can
easily
picture
him
to
myself
in
the
peopled
gloom
of
the
*NL*
cavernous
place
,
with
the
light
of
the
globe-lamp
falling
on
a
small
*NL*
portion
of
the
bulkhead
that
had
the
weight
of
the
ocean
on
the
other
*NL*
side
,
and
the
breathing
of
unconscious
sleepers
in
his
ears
.
I
can
see
*NL*
him
glaring
at
the
iron
,
startled
by
the
falling
rust
,
overburdened
by
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
an
imminent
death
.
This
,
I
gathered
,
was
the
second
*NL*
time
he
had
been
sent
forward
by
that
skipper
of
his
,
who
,
I
rather
*NL*
think
,
wanted
to
keep
him
away
from
the
bridge
.
He
told
me
that
his
*NL*
first
impulse
was
to
shout
and
straightway
make
all
those
people
*NL*
leap
out
of
sleep
into
terror
;
but
such
an
overwhelming
sense
of
his
*NL*
helplessness
came
over
him
that
he
was
not
able
to
produce
a
sound
.
This
*NL*
is
,
I
suppose
,
what
people
mean
by
the
tongue
cleaving
to
the
roof
of
*NL*
the
mouth
.
``
Too
dry
,
''
was
the
concise
expression
he
used
in
reference
to
*NL*
this
state
.
Without
a
sound
,
then
,
he
scrambled
out
on
deck
through
*NL*
the
number
one
hatch
.
A
windsail
rigged
down
there
swung
against
him
*NL*
accidentally
,
and
he
remembered
that
the
light
touch
of
the
canvas
on
*NL*
his
face
nearly
knocked
him
off
the
hatchway
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
confessed
that
his
knees
wobbled
a
good
deal
as
he
stood
on
the
*NL*
foredeck
looking
at
another
sleeping
crowd
.
The
engines
having
been
*NL*
stopped
by
that
time
,
the
steam
was
blowing
off
.
Its
deep
rumble
made
*NL*
the
whole
night
vibrate
like
a
bass
string
.
The
ship
trembled
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
saw
here
and
there
a
head
lifted
off
a
mat
,
a
vague
form
uprise
in
*NL*
sitting
posture
,
listen
sleepily
for
a
moment
,
sink
down
again
into
the
*NL*
billowy
confusion
of
boxes
,
steam-winches
,
ventilators
.
He
was
aware
*NL*
all
these
people
did
not
know
enough
to
take
intelligent
notice
of
*NL*
that
strange
noise
.
The
ship
of
iron
,
the
men
with
white
faces
,
all
the
*NL*
sights
,
all
the
sounds
,
everything
on
board
to
that
ignorant
and
pious
*NL*
multitude
was
strange
alike
,
and
as
trustworthy
as
it
would
for
ever
*NL*
remain
incomprehensible
.
It
occurred
to
him
that
the
fact
was
fortunate
.
*NL*
The
idea
of
it
was
simply
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
remember
he
believed
,
as
any
other
man
would
have
done
in
*NL*
his
place
,
that
the
ship
would
go
down
at
any
moment
;
the
bulging
,
*NL*
rust-eaten
plates
that
kept
back
the
ocean
,
fatally
must
give
way
,
all
*NL*
at
once
like
an
undermined
dam
,
and
let
in
a
sudden
and
overwhelming
*NL*
flood
.
He
stood
still
looking
at
these
recumbent
bodies
,
a
doomed
man
*NL*
aware
of
his
fate
,
surveying
the
silent
company
of
the
dead
.
They
_
were
_
*NL*
dead
!
Nothing
could
save
them
!
There
were
boats
enough
for
half
of
them
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
there
was
no
time
.
No
time
!
No
time
!
It
did
not
seem
worth
*NL*
while
to
open
his
lips
,
to
stir
hand
or
foot
.
Before
he
could
shout
*NL*
three
words
,
or
make
three
steps
,
he
would
be
floundering
in
a
sea
*NL*
whitened
awfully
by
the
desperate
struggles
of
human
beings
,
clamorous
*NL*
with
the
distress
of
cries
for
help
.
There
was
no
help
.
He
imagined
*NL*
what
would
happen
perfectly
;
he
went
through
it
all
motionless
by
the
*NL*
hatchway
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
--
he
went
through
it
to
the
very
last
*NL*
harrowing
detail
.
I
think
he
went
through
it
again
while
he
was
telling
*NL*
me
these
things
he
could
not
tell
the
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
saw
as
clearly
as
I
see
you
now
that
there
was
nothing
I
could
do
.
*NL*
It
seemed
to
take
all
life
out
of
my
limbs
.
I
thought
I
might
just
as
*NL*
well
stand
where
I
was
and
wait
.
I
did
not
think
I
had
many
*NL*
seconds
...
''
Suddenly
the
steam
ceased
blowing
off
.
The
noise
,
he
*NL*
remarked
,
had
been
distracting
,
but
the
silence
at
once
became
*NL*
intolerably
oppressive
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
thought
I
would
choke
before
I
got
drowned
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
protested
he
did
not
think
of
saving
himself
.
The
only
distinct
*NL*
thought
formed
,
vanishing
,
and
re-forming
in
his
brain
,
was
:
eight
*NL*
hundred
people
and
seven
boats
;
eight
hundred
people
and
seven
boats
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Somebody
was
speaking
aloud
inside
my
head
,
''
he
said
a
little
wildly
.
*NL*
``
Eight
hundred
people
and
seven
boats
--
and
no
time
!
Just
think
of
it
.
''
*NL*
He
leaned
towards
me
across
the
little
table
,
and
I
tried
to
avoid
his
*NL*
stare
.
``
Do
you
think
I
was
afraid
of
death
?
''
he
asked
in
a
voice
very
*NL*
fierce
and
low
.
He
brought
down
his
open
hand
with
a
bang
that
made
the
*NL*
coffee-cups
dance
.
``
I
am
ready
to
swear
I
was
not
--
I
was
not
...
By
*NL*
God
--
no
!
''
He
hitched
himself
upright
and
crossed
his
arms
;
his
chin
fell
*NL*
on
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
soft
clashes
of
crockery
reached
us
faintly
through
the
high
*NL*
windows
.
There
was
a
burst
of
voices
,
and
several
men
came
out
in
high
*NL*
good-humour
into
the
gallery
.
They
were
exchanging
jocular
reminiscences
*NL*
of
the
donkeys
in
Cairo
.
A
pale
anxious
youth
stepping
softly
on
long
*NL*
legs
was
being
chaffed
by
a
strutting
and
rubicund
globe-trotter
about
*NL*
his
purchases
in
the
bazaar
.
``
No
,
really
--
do
you
think
I
've
been
done
*NL*
to
that
extent
?
''
he
inquired
very
earnest
and
deliberate
.
The
band
moved
*NL*
away
,
dropping
into
chairs
as
they
went
;
matches
flared
,
illuminating
*NL*
for
a
second
faces
without
the
ghost
of
an
expression
and
the
flat
glaze
*NL*
of
white
shirt-fronts
;
the
hum
of
many
conversations
animated
with
the
*NL*
ardour
of
feasting
sounded
to
me
absurd
and
infinitely
remote
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Some
of
the
crew
were
sleeping
on
the
number
one
hatch
within
reach
of
*NL*
my
arm
,
''
began
Jim
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
know
they
kept
Kalashee
watch
in
that
ship
,
all
hands
sleeping
*NL*
through
the
night
,
and
only
the
reliefs
of
quartermasters
and
look-out
*NL*
men
being
called
.
He
was
tempted
to
grip
and
shake
the
shoulder
of
the
*NL*
nearest
lascar
,
but
he
did
n't
.
Something
held
his
arms
down
along
his
*NL*
sides
.
He
was
not
afraid
--
oh
no
!
only
he
just
could
n't
--
that
's
all
.
He
*NL*
was
not
afraid
of
death
perhaps
,
but
I
'll
tell
you
what
,
he
was
afraid
*NL*
of
the
emergency
.
His
confounded
imagination
had
evoked
for
him
all
*NL*
the
horrors
of
panic
,
the
trampling
rush
,
the
pitiful
screams
,
boats
*NL*
swamped
--
all
the
appalling
incidents
of
a
disaster
at
sea
he
had
ever
*NL*
heard
of
.
He
might
have
been
resigned
to
die
but
I
suspect
he
wanted
*NL*
to
die
without
added
terrors
,
quietly
,
in
a
sort
of
peaceful
trance
.
A
*NL*
certain
readiness
to
perish
is
not
so
very
rare
,
but
it
is
seldom
*NL*
that
you
meet
men
whose
souls
,
steeled
in
the
impenetrable
armour
of
*NL*
resolution
,
are
ready
to
fight
a
losing
battle
to
the
last
;
the
desire
*NL*
of
peace
waxes
stronger
as
hope
declines
,
till
at
last
it
conquers
the
*NL*
very
desire
of
life
.
Which
of
us
here
has
not
observed
this
,
or
maybe
*NL*
experienced
something
of
that
feeling
in
his
own
person
--
this
extreme
*NL*
weariness
of
emotions
,
the
vanity
of
effort
,
the
yearning
for
rest
?
*NL*
Those
striving
with
unreasonable
forces
know
it
well
,
--
the
shipwrecked
*NL*
castaways
in
boats
,
wanderers
lost
in
a
desert
,
men
battling
against
the
*NL*
unthinking
might
of
nature
,
or
the
stupid
brutality
of
crowds
.

CHAPTER
8
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
How
long
he
stood
stock-still
by
the
hatch
expecting
every
moment
to
*NL*
feel
the
ship
dip
under
his
feet
and
the
rush
of
water
take
him
at
the
*NL*
back
and
toss
him
like
a
chip
,
I
can
not
say
.
Not
very
long
--
two
minutes
*NL*
perhaps
.
A
couple
of
men
he
could
not
make
out
began
to
converse
*NL*
drowsily
,
and
also
,
he
could
not
tell
where
,
he
detected
a
curious
*NL*
noise
of
shuffling
feet
.
Above
these
faint
sounds
there
was
that
awful
*NL*
stillness
preceding
a
catastrophe
,
that
trying
silence
of
the
moment
*NL*
before
the
crash
;
then
it
came
into
his
head
that
perhaps
he
would
have
*NL*
time
to
rush
along
and
cut
all
the
lanyards
of
the
gripes
,
so
that
the
*NL*
boats
would
float
as
the
ship
went
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Patna
had
a
long
bridge
,
and
all
the
boats
were
up
there
,
four
on
*NL*
one
side
and
three
on
the
other
--
the
smallest
of
them
on
the
port-side
*NL*
and
nearly
abreast
of
the
steering
gear
.
He
assured
me
,
with
evident
*NL*
anxiety
to
be
believed
,
that
he
had
been
most
careful
to
keep
them
ready
*NL*
for
instant
service
.
He
knew
his
duty
.
I
dare
say
he
was
a
good
enough
*NL*
mate
as
far
as
that
went
.
``
I
always
believed
in
being
prepared
for
the
*NL*
worst
,
''
he
commented
,
staring
anxiously
in
my
face
.
I
nodded
my
approval
*NL*
of
the
sound
principle
,
averting
my
eyes
before
the
subtle
unsoundness
*NL*
of
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
started
unsteadily
to
run
.
He
had
to
step
over
legs
,
avoid
stumbling
*NL*
against
the
heads
.
Suddenly
some
one
caught
hold
of
his
coat
from
below
,
*NL*
and
a
distressed
voice
spoke
under
his
elbow
.
The
light
of
the
lamp
he
*NL*
carried
in
his
right
hand
fell
upon
an
upturned
dark
face
whose
eyes
*NL*
entreated
him
together
with
the
voice
.
He
had
picked
up
enough
of
the
*NL*
language
to
understand
the
word
water
,
repeated
several
times
in
a
tone
*NL*
of
insistence
,
of
prayer
,
almost
of
despair
.
He
gave
a
jerk
to
get
away
,
*NL*
and
felt
an
arm
embrace
his
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
The
beggar
clung
to
me
like
a
drowning
man
,
''
he
said
impressively
.
*NL*
``
Water
,
water
!
What
water
did
he
mean
?
What
did
he
know
?
As
calmly
as
*NL*
I
could
I
ordered
him
to
let
go
.
He
was
stopping
me
,
time
was
pressing
,
*NL*
other
men
began
to
stir
;
I
wanted
time
--
time
to
cut
the
boats
adrift
.
*NL*
He
got
hold
of
my
hand
now
,
and
I
felt
that
he
would
begin
to
shout
.
It
*NL*
flashed
upon
me
it
was
enough
to
start
a
panic
,
and
I
hauled
off
with
*NL*
my
free
arm
and
slung
the
lamp
in
his
face
.
The
glass
jingled
,
the
light
*NL*
went
out
,
but
the
blow
made
him
let
go
,
and
I
ran
off
--
I
wanted
to
get
*NL*
at
the
boats
;
I
wanted
to
get
at
the
boats
.
He
leaped
after
me
from
*NL*
behind
.
I
turned
on
him
.
He
would
not
keep
quiet
;
he
tried
to
shout
;
I
*NL*
had
half
throttled
him
before
I
made
out
what
he
wanted
.
He
wanted
some
*NL*
water
--
water
to
drink
;
they
were
on
strict
allowance
,
you
know
,
and
*NL*
he
had
with
him
a
young
boy
I
had
noticed
several
times
.
His
child
was
*NL*
sick
--
and
thirsty
.
He
had
caught
sight
of
me
as
I
passed
by
,
and
was
*NL*
begging
for
a
little
water
.
That
's
all
.
We
were
under
the
bridge
,
in
*NL*
the
dark
.
He
kept
on
snatching
at
my
wrists
;
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
*NL*
him
.
I
dashed
into
my
berth
,
grabbed
my
water-bottle
,
and
thrust
it
into
*NL*
his
hands
.
He
vanished
.
I
did
n't
find
out
till
then
how
much
I
was
in
*NL*
want
of
a
drink
myself
.
''
He
leaned
on
one
elbow
with
a
hand
over
his
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
felt
a
creepy
sensation
all
down
my
backbone
;
there
was
something
*NL*
peculiar
in
all
this
.
The
fingers
of
the
hand
that
shaded
his
brow
*NL*
trembled
slightly
.
He
broke
the
short
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
These
things
happen
only
once
to
a
man
and
...
Ah
!
well
!
When
I
got
*NL*
on
the
bridge
at
last
the
beggars
were
getting
one
of
the
boats
off
the
*NL*
chocks
.
A
boat
!
I
was
running
up
the
ladder
when
a
heavy
blow
fell
on
*NL*
my
shoulder
,
just
missing
my
head
.
It
did
n't
stop
me
,
and
the
chief
*NL*
engineer
--
they
had
got
him
out
of
his
bunk
by
then
--
raised
the
*NL*
boat-stretcher
again
.
Somehow
I
had
no
mind
to
be
surprised
at
anything
.
*NL*
All
this
seemed
natural
--
and
awful
--
and
awful
.
I
dodged
that
miserable
*NL*
maniac
,
lifted
him
off
the
deck
as
though
he
had
been
a
little
child
,
*NL*
and
he
started
whispering
in
my
arms
:
`
Do
n't
!
do
n't
!
I
thought
you
were
*NL*
one
of
them
niggers
.
'
I
flung
him
away
,
he
skidded
along
the
bridge
and
*NL*
knocked
the
legs
from
under
the
little
chap
--
the
second
.
The
skipper
,
*NL*
busy
about
the
boat
,
looked
round
and
came
at
me
head
down
,
growling
*NL*
like
a
wild
beast
.
I
flinched
no
more
than
a
stone
.
I
was
as
solid
*NL*
standing
there
as
this
,
''
he
tapped
lightly
with
his
knuckles
the
wall
*NL*
beside
his
chair
.
``
It
was
as
though
I
had
heard
it
all
,
seen
it
all
,
*NL*
gone
through
it
all
twenty
times
already
.
I
was
n't
afraid
of
them
.
I
*NL*
drew
back
my
fist
and
he
stopped
short
,
muttering
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
''
`
Ah
!
it
's
you
.
Lend
a
hand
quick
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
That
's
what
he
said
.
Quick
!
As
if
anybody
could
be
quick
enough
.
*NL*
`
Are
n't
you
going
to
do
something
?
'
I
asked
.
`
Yes
.
Clear
out
,
'
he
*NL*
snarled
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
do
n't
think
I
understood
then
what
he
meant
.
The
other
two
had
*NL*
picked
themselves
up
by
that
time
,
and
they
rushed
together
to
the
boat
.
*NL*
They
tramped
,
they
wheezed
,
they
shoved
,
they
cursed
the
boat
,
the
ship
,
*NL*
each
other
--
cursed
me
.
All
in
mutters
.
I
did
n't
move
,
I
did
n't
speak
.
*NL*
I
watched
the
slant
of
the
ship
.
She
was
as
still
as
if
landed
on
the
*NL*
blocks
in
a
dry
dock
--
only
she
was
like
this
,
''
He
held
up
his
hand
,
*NL*
palm
under
,
the
tips
of
the
fingers
inclined
downwards
.
``
Like
this
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
.
``
I
could
see
the
line
of
the
horizon
before
me
,
as
clear
as
a
*NL*
bell
,
above
her
stem-head
;
I
could
see
the
water
far
off
there
black
*NL*
and
sparkling
,
and
still
--
still
as
a-pond
,
deadly
still
,
more
still
than
*NL*
ever
sea
was
before
--
more
still
than
I
could
bear
to
look
at
.
Have
you
*NL*
watched
a
ship
floating
head
down
,
checked
in
sinking
by
a
sheet
of
old
*NL*
iron
too
rotten
to
stand
being
shored
up
?
Have
you
?
Oh
yes
,
shored
up
?
I
*NL*
thought
of
that
--
I
thought
of
every
mortal
thing
;
but
can
you
shore
up
a
*NL*
bulkhead
in
five
minutes
--
or
in
fifty
for
that
matter
?
Where
was
I
going
*NL*
to
get
men
that
would
go
down
below
?
And
the
timber
--
the
timber
!
Would
*NL*
you
have
had
the
courage
to
swing
the
maul
for
the
first
blow
if
you
*NL*
had
seen
that
bulkhead
?
Do
n't
say
you
would
:
you
had
not
seen
it
;
nobody
*NL*
would
.
Hang
it
--
to
do
a
thing
like
that
you
must
believe
there
is
a
*NL*
chance
,
one
in
a
thousand
,
at
least
,
some
ghost
of
a
chance
;
and
you
*NL*
would
not
have
believed
.
Nobody
would
have
believed
.
You
think
me
a
*NL*
cur
for
standing
there
,
but
what
would
you
have
done
?
What
!
You
ca
n't
*NL*
tell
--
nobody
can
tell
.
One
must
have
time
to
turn
round
.
What
would
you
*NL*
have
me
do
?
Where
was
the
kindness
in
making
crazy
with
fright
all
those
*NL*
people
I
could
not
save
single-handed
--
that
nothing
could
save
?
Look
*NL*
here
!
As
true
as
I
sit
on
this
chair
before
you
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
drew
quick
breaths
at
every
few
words
and
shot
quick
glances
at
my
*NL*
face
,
as
though
in
his
anguish
he
were
watchful
of
the
effect
.
He
was
*NL*
not
speaking
to
me
,
he
was
only
speaking
before
me
,
in
a
dispute
with
*NL*
an
invisible
personality
,
an
antagonistic
and
inseparable
partner
of
his
*NL*
existence
--
another
possessor
of
his
soul
.
These
were
issues
beyond
the
*NL*
competency
of
a
court
of
inquiry
:
it
was
a
subtle
and
momentous
quarrel
*NL*
as
to
the
true
essence
of
life
,
and
did
not
want
a
judge
.
He
wanted
*NL*
an
ally
,
a
helper
,
an
accomplice
.
I
felt
the
risk
I
ran
of
being
*NL*
circumvented
,
blinded
,
decoyed
,
bullied
,
perhaps
,
into
taking
a
definite
*NL*
part
in
a
dispute
impossible
of
decision
if
one
had
to
be
fair
to
all
*NL*
the
phantoms
in
possession
--
to
the
reputable
that
had
its
claims
and
*NL*
to
the
disreputable
that
had
its
exigencies
.
I
ca
n't
explain
to
you
who
*NL*
have
n't
seen
him
and
who
hear
his
words
only
at
second
hand
the
mixed
*NL*
nature
of
my
feelings
.
It
seemed
to
me
I
was
being
made
to
comprehend
*NL*
the
Inconceivable
--
and
I
know
of
nothing
to
compare
with
the
discomfort
*NL*
of
such
a
sensation
.
I
was
made
to
look
at
the
convention
that
lurks
in
*NL*
all
truth
and
on
the
essential
sincerity
of
falsehood
.
He
appealed
to
*NL*
all
sides
at
once
--
to
the
side
turned
perpetually
to
the
light
of
day
,
*NL*
and
to
that
side
of
us
which
,
like
the
other
hemisphere
of
the
moon
,
*NL*
exists
stealthily
in
perpetual
darkness
,
with
only
a
fearful
ashy
light
*NL*
falling
at
times
on
the
edge
.
He
swayed
me
.
I
own
to
it
,
I
own
up
.
The
*NL*
occasion
was
obscure
,
insignificant
--
what
you
will
:
a
lost
youngster
,
*NL*
one
in
a
million
--
but
then
he
was
one
of
us
;
an
incident
as
completely
*NL*
devoid
of
importance
as
the
flooding
of
an
ant-heap
,
and
yet
the
mystery
*NL*
of
his
attitude
got
hold
of
me
as
though
he
had
been
an
individual
*NL*
in
the
forefront
of
his
kind
,
as
if
the
obscure
truth
involved
were
*NL*
momentous
enough
to
affect
mankind
's
conception
of
itself
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
Marlow
paused
to
put
new
life
into
his
expiring
cheroot
,
seemed
to
*NL*
forget
all
about
the
story
,
and
abruptly
began
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
fault
of
course
.
One
has
no
business
really
to
get
interested
.
It
's
*NL*
a
weakness
of
mine
.
His
was
of
another
kind
.
My
weakness
consists
in
not
*NL*
having
a
discriminating
eye
for
the
incidental
--
for
the
externals
--
no
*NL*
eye
for
the
hod
of
the
rag-picker
or
the
fine
linen
of
the
next
man
.
*NL*
Next
man
--
that
's
it
.
I
have
met
so
many
men
,
'
he
pursued
,
with
momentary
*NL*
sadness
--
`
met
them
too
with
a
certain
--
certain
--
impact
,
let
us
say
;
like
*NL*
this
fellow
,
for
instance
--
and
in
each
case
all
I
could
see
was
merely
*NL*
the
human
being
.
A
confounded
democratic
quality
of
vision
which
may
be
*NL*
better
than
total
blindness
,
but
has
been
of
no
advantage
to
me
,
I
can
*NL*
assure
you
.
Men
expect
one
to
take
into
account
their
fine
linen
.
But
*NL*
I
never
could
get
up
any
enthusiasm
about
these
things
.
Oh
!
it
's
a
*NL*
failing
;
it
's
a
failing
;
and
then
comes
a
soft
evening
;
a
lot
of
men
too
*NL*
indolent
for
whist
--
and
a
story
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
again
to
wait
for
an
encouraging
remark
,
perhaps
,
but
nobody
*NL*
spoke
;
only
the
host
,
as
if
reluctantly
performing
a
duty
,
murmured
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
are
so
subtle
,
Marlow
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
?
I
?
'
said
Marlow
in
a
low
voice
.
`
Oh
no
!
But
_
he
_
was
;
and
try
as
I
*NL*
may
for
the
success
of
this
yarn
,
I
am
missing
innumerable
shades
--
they
*NL*
were
so
fine
,
so
difficult
to
render
in
colourless
words
.
Because
he
*NL*
complicated
matters
by
being
so
simple
,
too
--
the
simplest
poor
*NL*
devil
!
...
By
Jove
!
he
was
amazing
.
There
he
sat
telling
me
that
just
*NL*
as
I
saw
him
before
my
eyes
he
would
n't
be
afraid
to
face
anything
--
and
*NL*
believing
in
it
too
.
I
tell
you
it
was
fabulously
innocent
and
it
was
*NL*
enormous
,
enormous
!
I
watched
him
covertly
,
just
as
though
I
had
*NL*
suspected
him
of
an
intention
to
take
a
jolly
good
rise
out
of
me
.
He
*NL*
was
confident
that
,
on
the
square
,
``
on
the
square
,
mind
!
''
there
was
*NL*
nothing
he
could
n't
meet
.
Ever
since
he
had
been
``
so
high
''
--
``
quite
a
*NL*
little
chap
,
''
he
had
been
preparing
himself
for
all
the
difficulties
*NL*
that
can
beset
one
on
land
and
water
.
He
confessed
proudly
to
this
kind
*NL*
of
foresight
.
He
had
been
elaborating
dangers
and
defences
,
expecting
*NL*
the
worst
,
rehearsing
his
best
.
He
must
have
led
a
most
exalted
*NL*
existence
.
Can
you
fancy
it
?
A
succession
of
adventures
,
so
much
glory
,
*NL*
such
a
victorious
progress
!
and
the
deep
sense
of
his
sagacity
crowning
*NL*
every
day
of
his
inner
life
.
He
forgot
himself
;
his
eyes
shone
;
and
with
*NL*
every
word
my
heart
,
searched
by
the
light
of
his
absurdity
,
was
growing
*NL*
heavier
in
my
breast
.
I
had
no
mind
to
laugh
,
and
lest
I
should
smile
I
*NL*
made
for
myself
a
stolid
face
.
He
gave
signs
of
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
is
always
the
unexpected
that
happens
,
''
I
said
in
a
propitiatory
*NL*
tone
.
My
obtuseness
provoked
him
into
a
contemptuous
``
Pshaw
!
''
I
suppose
*NL*
he
meant
that
the
unexpected
could
n't
touch
him
;
nothing
less
than
the
*NL*
unconceivable
itself
could
get
over
his
perfect
state
of
preparation
.
He
*NL*
had
been
taken
unawares
--
and
he
whispered
to
himself
a
malediction
upon
*NL*
the
waters
and
the
firmament
,
upon
the
ship
,
upon
the
men
.
Everything
*NL*
had
betrayed
him
!
He
had
been
tricked
into
that
sort
of
high-minded
*NL*
resignation
which
prevented
him
lifting
as
much
as
his
little
finger
,
*NL*
while
these
others
who
had
a
very
clear
perception
of
the
actual
*NL*
necessity
were
tumbling
against
each
other
and
sweating
desperately
over
*NL*
that
boat
business
.
Something
had
gone
wrong
there
at
the
last
moment
.
*NL*
It
appears
that
in
their
flurry
they
had
contrived
in
some
mysterious
*NL*
way
to
get
the
sliding
bolt
of
the
foremost
boat-chock
jammed
tight
,
and
*NL*
forthwith
had
gone
out
of
the
remnants
of
their
minds
over
the
deadly
*NL*
nature
of
that
accident
.
It
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
,
the
fierce
*NL*
industry
of
these
beggars
toiling
on
a
motionless
ship
that
floated
*NL*
quietly
in
the
silence
of
a
world
asleep
,
fighting
against
time
for
the
*NL*
freeing
of
that
boat
,
grovelling
on
all-fours
,
standing
up
in
despair
,
*NL*
tugging
,
pushing
,
snarling
at
each
other
venomously
,
ready
to
kill
,
*NL*
ready
to
weep
,
and
only
kept
from
flying
at
each
other
's
throats
by
*NL*
the
fear
of
death
that
stood
silent
behind
them
like
an
inflexible
and
*NL*
cold-eyed
taskmaster
.
Oh
yes
!
It
must
have
been
a
pretty
sight
.
He
*NL*
saw
it
all
,
he
could
talk
about
it
with
scorn
and
bitterness
;
he
had
a
*NL*
minute
knowledge
of
it
by
means
of
some
sixth
sense
,
I
conclude
,
because
*NL*
he
swore
to
me
he
had
remained
apart
without
a
glance
at
them
and
at
the
*NL*
boat
--
without
one
single
glance
.
And
I
believe
him
.
I
should
think
he
*NL*
was
too
busy
watching
the
threatening
slant
of
the
ship
,
the
suspended
*NL*
menace
discovered
in
the
midst
of
the
most
perfect
security
--
fascinated
*NL*
by
the
sword
hanging
by
a
hair
over
his
imaginative
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
in
the
world
moved
before
his
eyes
,
and
he
could
depict
to
*NL*
himself
without
hindrance
the
sudden
swing
upwards
of
the
dark
sky-line
,
*NL*
the
sudden
tilt
up
of
the
vast
plain
of
the
sea
,
the
swift
still
rise
,
*NL*
the
brutal
fling
,
the
grasp
of
the
abyss
,
the
struggle
without
hope
,
the
*NL*
starlight
closing
over
his
head
for
ever
like
the
vault
of
a
tomb
--
the
*NL*
revolt
of
his
young
life
--
the
black
end
.
He
could
!
By
Jove
!
who
*NL*
could
n't
?
And
you
must
remember
he
was
a
finished
artist
in
that
*NL*
peculiar
way
,
he
was
a
gifted
poor
devil
with
the
faculty
of
swift
and
*NL*
forestalling
vision
.
The
sights
it
showed
him
had
turned
him
into
cold
*NL*
stone
from
the
soles
of
his
feet
to
the
nape
of
his
neck
;
but
there
*NL*
was
a
hot
dance
of
thoughts
in
his
head
,
a
dance
of
lame
,
blind
,
mute
*NL*
thoughts
--
a
whirl
of
awful
cripples
.
Did
n't
I
tell
you
he
confessed
*NL*
himself
before
me
as
though
I
had
the
power
to
bind
and
to
loose
?
He
*NL*
burrowed
deep
,
deep
,
in
the
hope
of
my
absolution
,
which
would
have
been
*NL*
of
no
good
to
him
.
This
was
one
of
those
cases
which
no
solemn
deception
*NL*
can
palliate
,
where
no
man
can
help
;
where
his
very
Maker
seems
to
*NL*
abandon
a
sinner
to
his
own
devices
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
stood
on
the
starboard
side
of
the
bridge
,
as
far
as
he
could
get
*NL*
from
the
struggle
for
the
boat
,
which
went
on
with
the
agitation
*NL*
of
madness
and
the
stealthiness
of
a
conspiracy
.
The
two
Malays
had
*NL*
meantime
remained
holding
to
the
wheel
.
Just
picture
to
yourselves
*NL*
the
actors
in
that
,
thank
God
!
unique
,
episode
of
the
sea
,
four
beside
*NL*
themselves
with
fierce
and
secret
exertions
,
and
three
looking
on
in
*NL*
complete
immobility
,
above
the
awnings
covering
the
profound
ignorance
*NL*
of
hundreds
of
human
beings
,
with
their
weariness
,
with
their
dreams
,
*NL*
with
their
hopes
,
arrested
,
held
by
an
invisible
hand
on
the
brink
of
*NL*
annihilation
.
For
that
they
were
so
,
makes
no
doubt
to
me
:
given
the
*NL*
state
of
the
ship
,
this
was
the
deadliest
possible
description
of
*NL*
accident
that
could
happen
.
These
beggars
by
the
boat
had
every
reason
*NL*
to
go
distracted
with
funk
.
Frankly
,
had
I
been
there
,
I
would
not
have
*NL*
given
as
much
as
a
counterfeit
farthing
for
the
ship
's
chance
to
keep
*NL*
above
water
to
the
end
of
each
successive
second
.
And
still
she
*NL*
floated
!
These
sleeping
pilgrims
were
destined
to
accomplish
their
*NL*
whole
pilgrimage
to
the
bitterness
of
some
other
end
.
It
was
as
if
the
*NL*
Omnipotence
whose
mercy
they
confessed
had
needed
their
humble
testimony
*NL*
on
earth
for
a
while
longer
,
and
had
looked
down
to
make
a
sign
,
*NL*
``
Thou
shalt
not
!
''
to
the
ocean
.
Their
escape
would
trouble
me
as
a
*NL*
prodigiously
inexplicable
event
,
did
I
not
know
how
tough
old
iron
can
*NL*
be
--
as
tough
sometimes
as
the
spirit
of
some
men
we
meet
now
and
then
,
*NL*
worn
to
a
shadow
and
breasting
the
weight
of
life
.
Not
the
least
*NL*
wonder
of
these
twenty
minutes
,
to
my
mind
,
is
the
behaviour
of
the
two
*NL*
helmsmen
.
They
were
amongst
the
native
batch
of
all
sorts
brought
over
*NL*
from
Aden
to
give
evidence
at
the
inquiry
.
One
of
them
,
labouring
under
*NL*
intense
bashfulness
,
was
very
young
,
and
with
his
smooth
,
yellow
,
*NL*
cheery
countenance
looked
even
younger
than
he
was
.
I
remember
perfectly
*NL*
Brierly
asking
him
,
through
the
interpreter
,
what
he
thought
of
it
at
*NL*
the
time
,
and
the
interpreter
,
after
a
short
colloquy
,
turning
to
the
*NL*
court
with
an
important
air
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
says
he
thought
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
other
,
with
patient
blinking
eyes
,
a
blue
cotton
handkerchief
,
*NL*
faded
with
much
washing
,
bound
with
a
smart
twist
over
a
lot
of
grey
*NL*
wisps
,
his
face
shrunk
into
grim
hollows
,
his
brown
skin
made
darker
by
*NL*
a
mesh
of
wrinkles
,
explained
that
he
had
a
knowledge
of
some
evil
thing
*NL*
befalling
the
ship
,
but
there
had
been
no
order
;
he
could
not
remember
*NL*
an
order
;
why
should
he
leave
the
helm
?
To
some
further
questions
he
*NL*
jerked
back
his
spare
shoulders
,
and
declared
it
never
came
into
his
*NL*
mind
then
that
the
white
men
were
about
to
leave
the
ship
through
*NL*
fear
of
death
.
He
did
not
believe
it
now
.
There
might
have
been
secret
*NL*
reasons
.
He
wagged
his
old
chin
knowingly
.
Aha
!
secret
reasons
.
He
was
*NL*
a
man
of
great
experience
,
and
he
wanted
_
that
_
white
Tuan
to
know
--
he
*NL*
turned
towards
Brierly
,
who
did
n't
raise
his
head
--
that
he
had
acquired
*NL*
a
knowledge
of
many
things
by
serving
white
men
on
the
sea
for
a
great
*NL*
number
of
years
--
and
,
suddenly
,
with
shaky
excitement
he
poured
upon
*NL*
our
spellbound
attention
a
lot
of
queer-sounding
names
,
names
of
*NL*
dead-and-gone
skippers
,
names
of
forgotten
country
ships
,
names
of
*NL*
familiar
and
distorted
sound
,
as
if
the
hand
of
dumb
time
had
been
at
*NL*
work
on
them
for
ages
.
They
stopped
him
at
last
.
A
silence
fell
upon
*NL*
the
court
,
--
a
silence
that
remained
unbroken
for
at
least
a
minute
,
and
*NL*
passed
gently
into
a
deep
murmur
.
This
episode
was
the
sensation
of
*NL*
the
second
day
's
proceedings
--
affecting
all
the
audience
,
affecting
*NL*
everybody
except
Jim
,
who
was
sitting
moodily
at
the
end
of
the
first
*NL*
bench
,
and
never
looked
up
at
this
extraordinary
and
damning
witness
*NL*
that
seemed
possessed
of
some
mysterious
theory
of
defence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
these
two
lascars
stuck
to
the
helm
of
that
ship
without
*NL*
steerage-way
,
where
death
would
have
found
them
if
such
had
been
their
*NL*
destiny
.
The
whites
did
not
give
them
half
a
glance
,
had
probably
*NL*
forgotten
their
existence
.
Assuredly
Jim
did
not
remember
it
.
He
*NL*
remembered
he
could
do
nothing
;
he
could
do
nothing
,
now
he
was
alone
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
do
but
to
sink
with
the
ship
.
No
use
making
a
*NL*
disturbance
about
it
.
Was
there
?
He
waited
upstanding
,
without
a
sound
,
*NL*
stiffened
in
the
idea
of
some
sort
of
heroic
discretion
.
The
first
*NL*
engineer
ran
cautiously
across
the
bridge
to
tug
at
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Come
and
help
!
For
God
's
sake
,
come
and
help
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
ran
back
to
the
boat
on
the
points
of
his
toes
,
and
returned
*NL*
directly
to
worry
at
his
sleeve
,
begging
and
cursing
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
believe
he
would
have
kissed
my
hands
,
''
said
Jim
savagely
,
``
and
,
*NL*
next
moment
,
he
starts
foaming
and
whispering
in
my
face
,
`
If
I
had
*NL*
the
time
I
would
like
to
crack
your
skull
for
you
.
'
I
pushed
him
away
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
caught
hold
of
me
round
the
neck
.
Damn
him
!
I
hit
him
.
I
*NL*
hit
out
without
looking
.
`
Wo
n't
you
save
your
own
life
--
you
infernal
*NL*
coward
?
'
he
sobs
.
Coward
!
He
called
me
an
infernal
coward
!
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
*NL*
ha
!
He
called
me
--
ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
thrown
himself
back
and
was
shaking
with
laughter
.
I
had
never
*NL*
in
my
life
heard
anything
so
bitter
as
that
noise
.
It
fell
like
a
blight
*NL*
on
all
the
merriment
about
donkeys
,
pyramids
,
bazaars
,
or
what
not
.
*NL*
Along
the
whole
dim
length
of
the
gallery
the
voices
dropped
,
the
pale
*NL*
blotches
of
faces
turned
our
way
with
one
accord
,
and
the
silence
*NL*
became
so
profound
that
the
clear
tinkle
of
a
teaspoon
falling
on
*NL*
the
tesselated
floor
of
the
verandah
rang
out
like
a
tiny
and
silvery
*NL*
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
must
n't
laugh
like
this
,
with
all
these
people
about
,
''
I
*NL*
remonstrated
.
``
It
is
n't
nice
for
them
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
gave
no
sign
of
having
heard
at
first
,
but
after
a
while
,
with
a
*NL*
stare
that
,
missing
me
altogether
,
seemed
to
probe
the
heart
of
some
*NL*
awful
vision
,
he
muttered
carelessly
--
``
Oh
!
they
'll
think
I
am
drunk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
after
that
you
would
have
thought
from
his
appearance
he
would
*NL*
never
make
a
sound
again
.
But
--
no
fear
!
He
could
no
more
stop
telling
*NL*
now
than
he
could
have
stopped
living
by
the
mere
exertion
of
his
will
.

CHAPTER
9
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
was
saying
to
myself
,
`
Sink
--
curse
you
!
Sink
!
'
''
These
were
the
*NL*
words
with
which
he
began
again
.
He
wanted
it
over
.
He
was
severely
left
*NL*
alone
,
and
he
formulated
in
his
head
this
address
to
the
ship
in
a
*NL*
tone
of
imprecation
,
while
at
the
same
time
he
enjoyed
the
privilege
of
*NL*
witnessing
scenes
--
as
far
as
I
can
judge
--
of
low
comedy
.
They
were
still
*NL*
at
that
bolt
.
The
skipper
was
ordering
,
``
Get
under
and
try
to
lift
''
;
and
*NL*
the
others
naturally
shirked
.
You
understand
that
to
be
squeezed
flat
*NL*
under
the
keel
of
a
boat
was
n't
a
desirable
position
to
be
caught
in
if
*NL*
the
ship
went
down
suddenly
.
``
Why
do
n't
you
--
you
the
strongest
?
''
whined
*NL*
the
little
engineer
.
``
Gott-for-dam
!
I
am
too
thick
,
''
spluttered
the
*NL*
skipper
in
despair
.
It
was
funny
enough
to
make
angels
weep
.
They
stood
*NL*
idle
for
a
moment
,
and
suddenly
the
chief
engineer
rushed
again
at
Jim
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Come
and
help
,
man
!
Are
you
mad
to
throw
your
only
chance
away
?
Come
*NL*
and
help
,
man
!
Man
!
Look
there
--
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
at
last
Jim
looked
astern
where
the
other
pointed
with
maniacal
*NL*
insistence
.
He
saw
a
silent
black
squall
which
had
eaten
up
already
*NL*
one-third
of
the
sky
.
You
know
how
these
squalls
come
up
there
about
*NL*
that
time
of
the
year
.
First
you
see
a
darkening
of
the
horizon
--
no
*NL*
more
;
then
a
cloud
rises
opaque
like
a
wall
.
A
straight
edge
of
vapour
*NL*
lined
with
sickly
whitish
gleams
flies
up
from
the
southwest
,
swallowing
*NL*
the
stars
in
whole
constellations
;
its
shadow
flies
over
the
waters
,
and
*NL*
confounds
sea
and
sky
into
one
abyss
of
obscurity
.
And
all
is
still
.
*NL*
No
thunder
,
no
wind
,
no
sound
;
not
a
flicker
of
lightning
.
Then
in
*NL*
the
tenebrous
immensity
a
livid
arch
appears
;
a
swell
or
two
like
*NL*
undulations
of
the
very
darkness
run
past
,
and
suddenly
,
wind
and
rain
*NL*
strike
together
with
a
peculiar
impetuosity
as
if
they
had
burst
through
*NL*
something
solid
.
Such
a
cloud
had
come
up
while
they
were
n't
looking
.
*NL*
They
had
just
noticed
it
,
and
were
perfectly
justified
in
surmising
*NL*
that
if
in
absolute
stillness
there
was
some
chance
for
the
ship
to
keep
*NL*
afloat
a
few
minutes
longer
,
the
least
disturbance
of
the
sea
would
make
*NL*
an
end
of
her
instantly
.
Her
first
nod
to
the
swell
that
precedes
the
*NL*
burst
of
such
a
squall
would
be
also
her
last
,
would
become
a
plunge
,
*NL*
would
,
so
to
speak
,
be
prolonged
into
a
long
dive
,
down
,
down
to
the
*NL*
bottom
.
Hence
these
new
capers
of
their
fright
,
these
new
antics
in
*NL*
which
they
displayed
their
extreme
aversion
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
was
black
,
black
,
''
pursued
Jim
with
moody
steadiness
.
``
It
had
*NL*
sneaked
upon
us
from
behind
.
The
infernal
thing
!
I
suppose
there
had
*NL*
been
at
the
back
of
my
head
some
hope
yet
.
I
do
n't
know
.
But
that
was
*NL*
all
over
anyhow
.
It
maddened
me
to
see
myself
caught
like
this
.
I
was
*NL*
angry
,
as
though
I
had
been
trapped
.
I
_
was
_
trapped
!
The
night
was
hot
,
*NL*
too
,
I
remember
.
Not
a
breath
of
air
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
remembered
so
well
that
,
gasping
in
the
chair
,
he
seemed
to
sweat
*NL*
and
choke
before
my
eyes
.
No
doubt
it
maddened
him
;
it
knocked
him
over
*NL*
afresh
--
in
a
manner
of
speaking
--
but
it
made
him
also
remember
that
*NL*
important
purpose
which
had
sent
him
rushing
on
that
bridge
only
to
slip
*NL*
clean
out
of
his
mind
.
He
had
intended
to
cut
the
lifeboats
clear
of
the
*NL*
ship
.
He
whipped
out
his
knife
and
went
to
work
slashing
as
though
he
*NL*
had
seen
nothing
,
had
heard
nothing
,
had
known
of
no
one
on
board
.
They
*NL*
thought
him
hopelessly
wrong-headed
and
crazy
,
but
dared
not
protest
*NL*
noisily
against
this
useless
loss
of
time
.
When
he
had
done
he
returned
*NL*
to
the
very
same
spot
from
which
he
had
started
.
The
chief
was
there
,
*NL*
ready
with
a
clutch
at
him
to
whisper
close
to
his
head
,
scathingly
,
as
*NL*
though
he
wanted
to
bite
his
ear
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
silly
fool
!
do
you
think
you
'll
get
the
ghost
of
a
show
when
all
*NL*
that
lot
of
brutes
is
in
the
water
?
Why
,
they
will
batter
your
head
for
*NL*
you
from
these
boats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
wrung
his
hands
,
ignored
,
at
Jim
's
elbow
.
The
skipper
kept
up
a
*NL*
nervous
shuffle
in
one
place
and
mumbled
,
``
Hammer
!
hammer
!
Mein
Gott
!
*NL*
Get
a
hammer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
little
engineer
whimpered
like
a
child
,
but
,
broken
arm
and
all
,
*NL*
he
turned
out
the
least
craven
of
the
lot
as
it
seems
,
and
,
actually
,
*NL*
mustered
enough
pluck
to
run
an
errand
to
the
engine-room
.
No
trifle
,
it
*NL*
must
be
owned
in
fairness
to
him
.
Jim
told
me
he
darted
desperate
looks
*NL*
like
a
cornered
man
,
gave
one
low
wail
,
and
dashed
off
.
He
was
back
*NL*
instantly
clambering
,
hammer
in
hand
,
and
without
a
pause
flung
himself
*NL*
at
the
bolt
.
The
others
gave
up
Jim
at
once
and
ran
off
to
assist
.
*NL*
He
heard
the
tap
,
tap
of
the
hammer
,
the
sound
of
the
released
chock
*NL*
falling
over
.
The
boat
was
clear
.
Only
then
he
turned
to
look
--
only
*NL*
then
.
But
he
kept
his
distance
--
he
kept
his
distance
.
He
wanted
me
to
*NL*
know
he
had
kept
his
distance
;
that
there
was
nothing
in
common
between
*NL*
him
and
these
men
--
who
had
the
hammer
.
Nothing
whatever
.
It
is
more
than
*NL*
probable
he
thought
himself
cut
off
from
them
by
a
space
that
could
*NL*
not
be
traversed
,
by
an
obstacle
that
could
not
be
overcome
,
by
a
chasm
*NL*
without
bottom
.
He
was
as
far
as
he
could
get
from
them
--
the
whole
*NL*
breadth
of
the
ship
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
feet
were
glued
to
that
remote
spot
and
his
eyes
to
their
*NL*
indistinct
group
bowed
together
and
swaying
strangely
in
the
common
*NL*
torment
of
fear
.
A
hand-lamp
lashed
to
a
stanchion
above
a
little
table
*NL*
rigged
up
on
the
bridge
--
the
Patna
had
no
chart-room
amidships
--
threw
a
*NL*
light
on
their
labouring
shoulders
,
on
their
arched
and
bobbing
backs
.
*NL*
They
pushed
at
the
bow
of
the
boat
;
they
pushed
out
into
the
night
;
they
*NL*
pushed
,
and
would
no
more
look
back
at
him
.
They
had
given
him
up
as
if
*NL*
indeed
he
had
been
too
far
,
too
hopelessly
separated
from
themselves
,
to
*NL*
be
worth
an
appealing
word
,
a
glance
,
or
a
sign
.
They
had
no
leisure
to
*NL*
look
back
upon
his
passive
heroism
,
to
feel
the
sting
of
his
abstention
.
*NL*
The
boat
was
heavy
;
they
pushed
at
the
bow
with
no
breath
to
spare
for
*NL*
an
encouraging
word
:
but
the
turmoil
of
terror
that
had
scattered
their
*NL*
self-command
like
chaff
before
the
wind
,
converted
their
desperate
*NL*
exertions
into
a
bit
of
fooling
,
upon
my
word
,
fit
for
knockabout
clowns
*NL*
in
a
farce
.
They
pushed
with
their
hands
,
with
their
heads
,
they
pushed
*NL*
for
dear
life
with
all
the
weight
of
their
bodies
,
they
pushed
with
all
*NL*
the
might
of
their
souls
--
only
no
sooner
had
they
succeeded
in
canting
*NL*
the
stem
clear
of
the
davit
than
they
would
leave
off
like
one
man
and
*NL*
start
a
wild
scramble
into
her
.
As
a
natural
consequence
the
boat
would
*NL*
swing
in
abruptly
,
driving
them
back
,
helpless
and
jostling
against
each
*NL*
other
.
They
would
stand
nonplussed
for
a
while
,
exchanging
in
fierce
*NL*
whispers
all
the
infamous
names
they
could
call
to
mind
,
and
go
at
it
*NL*
again
.
Three
times
this
occurred
.
He
described
it
to
me
with
morose
*NL*
thoughtfulness
.
He
had
n't
lost
a
single
movement
of
that
comic
business
.
*NL*
``
I
loathed
them
.
I
hated
them
.
I
had
to
look
at
all
that
,
''
he
said
*NL*
without
emphasis
,
turning
upon
me
a
sombrely
watchful
glance
.
``
Was
ever
*NL*
there
any
one
so
shamefully
tried
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
took
his
head
in
his
hands
for
a
moment
,
like
a
man
driven
to
*NL*
distraction
by
some
unspeakable
outrage
.
These
were
things
he
could
not
*NL*
explain
to
the
court
--
and
not
even
to
me
;
but
I
would
have
been
little
*NL*
fitted
for
the
reception
of
his
confidences
had
I
not
been
able
at
times
*NL*
to
understand
the
pauses
between
the
words
.
In
this
assault
upon
*NL*
his
fortitude
there
was
the
jeering
intention
of
a
spiteful
and
*NL*
vile
vengeance
;
there
was
an
element
of
burlesque
in
his
ordeal
--
a
*NL*
degradation
of
funny
grimaces
in
the
approach
of
death
or
dishonour
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
related
facts
which
I
have
not
forgotten
,
but
at
this
distance
of
*NL*
time
I
could
n't
recall
his
very
words
:
I
only
remember
that
he
managed
*NL*
wonderfully
to
convey
the
brooding
rancour
of
his
mind
into
the
bare
*NL*
recital
of
events
.
Twice
,
he
told
me
,
he
shut
his
eyes
in
the
certitude
*NL*
that
the
end
was
upon
him
already
,
and
twice
he
had
to
open
them
again
.
*NL*
Each
time
he
noted
the
darkening
of
the
great
stillness
.
The
shadow
of
*NL*
the
silent
cloud
had
fallen
upon
the
ship
from
the
zenith
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
have
extinguished
every
sound
of
her
teeming
life
.
He
could
no
longer
*NL*
hear
the
voices
under
the
awnings
.
He
told
me
that
each
time
he
closed
*NL*
his
eyes
a
flash
of
thought
showed
him
that
crowd
of
bodies
,
laid
out
*NL*
for
death
,
as
plain
as
daylight
.
When
he
opened
them
,
it
was
to
see
the
*NL*
dim
struggle
of
four
men
fighting
like
mad
with
a
stubborn
boat
.
``
They
*NL*
would
fall
back
before
it
time
after
time
,
stand
swearing
at
each
other
,
*NL*
and
suddenly
make
another
rush
in
a
bunch
...
Enough
to
make
you
*NL*
die
laughing
,
''
he
commented
with
downcast
eyes
;
then
raising
them
for
a
*NL*
moment
to
my
face
with
a
dismal
smile
,
``
I
ought
to
have
a
merry
life
*NL*
of
it
,
by
God
!
for
I
shall
see
that
funny
sight
a
good
many
times
yet
*NL*
before
I
die
.
''
His
eyes
fell
again
.
``
See
and
hear
...
See
and
hear
,
''
*NL*
he
repeated
twice
,
at
long
intervals
,
filled
by
vacant
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
roused
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
made
up
my
mind
to
keep
my
eyes
shut
,
''
he
said
,
``
and
I
could
n't
.
I
*NL*
could
n't
,
and
I
do
n't
care
who
knows
it
.
Let
them
go
through
that
kind
*NL*
of
thing
before
they
talk
.
Just
let
them
--
and
do
better
--
that
's
all
.
The
*NL*
second
time
my
eyelids
flew
open
and
my
mouth
too
.
I
had
felt
the
*NL*
ship
move
.
She
just
dipped
her
bows
--
and
lifted
them
gently
--
and
slow
!
*NL*
everlastingly
slow
;
and
ever
so
little
.
She
had
n't
done
that
much
for
*NL*
days
.
The
cloud
had
raced
ahead
,
and
this
first
swell
seemed
to
travel
*NL*
upon
a
sea
of
lead
.
There
was
no
life
in
that
stir
.
It
managed
,
though
,
*NL*
to
knock
over
something
in
my
head
.
What
would
you
have
done
?
You
are
*NL*
sure
of
yourself
--
are
n't
you
?
What
would
you
do
if
you
felt
now
--
this
*NL*
minute
--
the
house
here
move
,
just
move
a
little
under
your
chair
.
Leap
!
*NL*
By
heavens
!
you
would
take
one
spring
from
where
you
sit
and
land
in
*NL*
that
clump
of
bushes
yonder
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
flung
his
arm
out
at
the
night
beyond
the
stone
balustrade
.
I
held
*NL*
my
peace
.
He
looked
at
me
very
steadily
,
very
severe
.
There
could
be
no
*NL*
mistake
:
I
was
being
bullied
now
,
and
it
behoved
me
to
make
no
sign
lest
*NL*
by
a
gesture
or
a
word
I
should
be
drawn
into
a
fatal
admission
about
*NL*
myself
which
would
have
had
some
bearing
on
the
case
.
I
was
not
disposed
*NL*
to
take
any
risk
of
that
sort
.
Do
n't
forget
I
had
him
before
me
,
and
*NL*
really
he
was
too
much
like
one
of
us
not
to
be
dangerous
.
But
if
you
*NL*
want
to
know
I
do
n't
mind
telling
you
that
I
did
,
with
a
rapid
glance
,
*NL*
estimate
the
distance
to
the
mass
of
denser
blackness
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
grass-plot
before
the
verandah
.
He
exaggerated
.
I
would
have
landed
*NL*
short
by
several
feet
--
and
that
's
the
only
thing
of
which
I
am
fairly
*NL*
certain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
last
moment
had
come
,
as
he
thought
,
and
he
did
not
move
.
His
feet
*NL*
remained
glued
to
the
planks
if
his
thoughts
were
knocking
about
loose
*NL*
in
his
head
.
It
was
at
this
moment
too
that
he
saw
one
of
the
men
around
*NL*
the
boat
step
backwards
suddenly
,
clutch
at
the
air
with
raised
arms
,
*NL*
totter
and
collapse
.
He
did
n't
exactly
fall
,
he
only
slid
gently
into
a
*NL*
sitting
posture
,
all
hunched
up
,
and
with
his
shoulders
propped
against
*NL*
the
side
of
the
engine-room
skylight
.
``
That
was
the
donkey-man
.
*NL*
A
haggard
,
white-faced
chap
with
a
ragged
moustache
.
Acted
third
*NL*
engineer
,
''
he
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Dead
,
''
I
said
.
We
had
heard
something
of
that
in
court
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
So
they
say
,
''
he
pronounced
with
sombre
indifference
.
``
Of
course
I
*NL*
never
knew
.
Weak
heart
.
The
man
had
been
complaining
of
being
out
of
*NL*
sorts
for
some
time
before
.
Excitement
.
Over-exertion
.
Devil
only
knows
.
*NL*
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
It
was
easy
to
see
he
did
not
want
to
die
either
.
Droll
,
*NL*
is
n't
it
?
May
I
be
shot
if
he
had
n't
been
fooled
into
killing
himself
!
*NL*
Fooled
--
neither
more
nor
less
.
Fooled
into
it
,
by
heavens
!
just
as
*NL*
I
...
Ah
!
If
he
had
only
kept
still
;
if
he
had
only
told
them
to
go
to
*NL*
the
devil
when
they
came
to
rush
him
out
of
his
bunk
because
the
ship
*NL*
was
sinking
!
If
he
had
only
stood
by
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
*NL*
called
them
names
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
got
up
,
shook
his
fist
,
glared
at
me
,
and
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
A
chance
missed
,
eh
?
''
I
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Why
do
n't
you
laugh
?
''
he
said
.
``
A
joke
hatched
in
hell
.
Weak
*NL*
heart
!
...
I
wish
sometimes
mine
had
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
irritated
me
.
``
Do
you
?
''
I
exclaimed
with
deep-rooted
irony
.
``
Yes
!
*NL*
Ca
n't
_
you
_
understand
?
''
he
cried
.
``
I
do
n't
know
what
more
you
could
*NL*
wish
for
,
''
I
said
angrily
.
He
gave
me
an
utterly
uncomprehending
glance
.
*NL*
This
shaft
had
also
gone
wide
of
the
mark
,
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
*NL*
bother
about
stray
arrows
.
Upon
my
word
,
he
was
too
unsuspecting
;
he
was
*NL*
not
fair
game
.
I
was
glad
that
my
missile
had
been
thrown
away
,
--
that
he
*NL*
had
not
even
heard
the
twang
of
the
bow
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
he
could
not
know
at
the
time
the
man
was
dead
.
The
next
*NL*
minute
--
his
last
on
board
--
was
crowded
with
a
tumult
of
events
and
*NL*
sensations
which
beat
about
him
like
the
sea
upon
a
rock
.
I
use
the
*NL*
simile
advisedly
,
because
from
his
relation
I
am
forced
to
believe
*NL*
he
had
preserved
through
it
all
a
strange
illusion
of
passiveness
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
not
acted
but
had
suffered
himself
to
be
handled
by
the
*NL*
infernal
powers
who
had
selected
him
for
the
victim
of
their
practical
*NL*
joke
.
The
first
thing
that
came
to
him
was
the
grinding
surge
of
the
*NL*
heavy
davits
swinging
out
at
last
--
a
jar
which
seemed
to
enter
his
body
*NL*
from
the
deck
through
the
soles
of
his
feet
,
and
travel
up
his
spine
to
*NL*
the
crown
of
his
head
.
Then
,
the
squall
being
very
near
now
,
another
*NL*
and
a
heavier
swell
lifted
the
passive
hull
in
a
threatening
heave
that
*NL*
checked
his
breath
,
while
his
brain
and
his
heart
together
were
pierced
*NL*
as
with
daggers
by
panic-stricken
screams
.
``
Let
go
!
For
God
's
sake
,
*NL*
let
go
!
Let
go
!
She
's
going
.
''
Following
upon
that
the
boat-falls
ripped
*NL*
through
the
blocks
,
and
a
lot
of
men
began
to
talk
in
startled
tones
*NL*
under
the
awnings
.
``
When
these
beggars
did
break
out
,
their
yelps
were
*NL*
enough
to
wake
the
dead
,
''
he
said
.
Next
,
after
the
splashing
shock
*NL*
of
the
boat
literally
dropped
in
the
water
,
came
the
hollow
noises
of
*NL*
stamping
and
tumbling
in
her
,
mingled
with
confused
shouts
:
``
Unhook
!
*NL*
Unhook
!
Shove
!
Unhook
!
Shove
for
your
life
!
Here
's
the
squall
down
on
*NL*
us
...
''
He
heard
,
high
above
his
head
,
the
faint
muttering
of
the
*NL*
wind
;
he
heard
below
his
feet
a
cry
of
pain
.
A
lost
voice
alongside
*NL*
started
cursing
a
swivel
hook
.
The
ship
began
to
buzz
fore
and
aft
*NL*
like
a
disturbed
hive
,
and
,
as
quietly
as
he
was
telling
me
of
all
*NL*
this
--
because
just
then
he
was
very
quiet
in
attitude
,
in
face
,
in
*NL*
voice
--
he
went
on
to
say
without
the
slightest
warning
as
it
were
,
``
I
*NL*
stumbled
over
his
legs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
was
the
first
I
heard
of
his
having
moved
at
all
.
I
could
not
*NL*
restrain
a
grunt
of
surprise
.
Something
had
started
him
off
at
last
,
but
*NL*
of
the
exact
moment
,
of
the
cause
that
tore
him
out
of
his
immobility
,
*NL*
he
knew
no
more
than
the
uprooted
tree
knows
of
the
wind
that
laid
it
*NL*
low
.
All
this
had
come
to
him
:
the
sounds
,
the
sights
,
the
legs
of
the
*NL*
dead
man
--
by
Jove
!
The
infernal
joke
was
being
crammed
devilishly
down
*NL*
his
throat
,
but
--
look
you
--
he
was
not
going
to
admit
of
any
sort
of
*NL*
swallowing
motion
in
his
gullet
.
It
's
extraordinary
how
he
could
cast
*NL*
upon
you
the
spirit
of
his
illusion
.
I
listened
as
if
to
a
tale
of
black
*NL*
magic
at
work
upon
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
went
over
sideways
,
very
gently
,
and
this
is
the
last
thing
I
*NL*
remember
seeing
on
board
,
''
he
continued
.
``
I
did
not
care
what
he
did
.
*NL*
It
looked
as
though
he
were
picking
himself
up
:
I
thought
he
was
picking
*NL*
himself
up
,
of
course
:
I
expected
him
to
bolt
past
me
over
the
rail
and
*NL*
drop
into
the
boat
after
the
others
.
I
could
hear
them
knocking
about
*NL*
down
there
,
and
a
voice
as
if
crying
up
a
shaft
called
out
`
George
!
'
*NL*
Then
three
voices
together
raised
a
yell
.
They
came
to
me
separately
:
*NL*
one
bleated
,
another
screamed
,
one
howled
.
Ough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shivered
a
little
,
and
I
beheld
him
rise
slowly
as
if
a
steady
*NL*
hand
from
above
had
been
pulling
him
out
of
the
chair
by
his
hair
.
Up
,
*NL*
slowly
--
to
his
full
height
,
and
when
his
knees
had
locked
stiff
the
hand
*NL*
let
him
go
,
and
he
swayed
a
little
on
his
feet
.
There
was
a
suggestion
*NL*
of
awful
stillness
in
his
face
,
in
his
movements
,
in
his
very
voice
when
*NL*
he
said
``
They
shouted
''
--
and
involuntarily
I
pricked
up
my
ears
for
*NL*
the
ghost
of
that
shout
that
would
be
heard
directly
through
the
false
*NL*
effect
of
silence
.
``
There
were
eight
hundred
people
in
that
ship
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
impaling
me
to
the
back
of
my
seat
with
an
awful
blank
stare
.
*NL*
``
Eight
hundred
living
people
,
and
they
were
yelling
after
the
one
dead
*NL*
man
to
come
down
and
be
saved
.
`
Jump
,
George
!
Jump
!
Oh
,
jump
!
'
I
stood
*NL*
by
with
my
hand
on
the
davit
.
I
was
very
quiet
.
It
had
come
over
pitch
*NL*
dark
.
You
could
see
neither
sky
nor
sea
.
I
heard
the
boat
alongside
go
*NL*
bump
,
bump
,
and
not
another
sound
down
there
for
a
while
,
but
the
ship
*NL*
under
me
was
full
of
talking
noises
.
Suddenly
the
skipper
howled
`
Mein
*NL*
Gott
!
The
squall
!
The
squall
!
Shove
off
!
'
With
the
first
hiss
of
rain
,
*NL*
and
the
first
gust
of
wind
,
they
screamed
,
`
Jump
,
George
!
We
'll
catch
*NL*
you
!
Jump
!
'
The
ship
began
a
slow
plunge
;
the
rain
swept
over
her
like
*NL*
a
broken
sea
;
my
cap
flew
off
my
head
;
my
breath
was
driven
back
into
*NL*
my
throat
.
I
heard
as
if
I
had
been
on
the
top
of
a
tower
another
wild
*NL*
screech
,
`
Geo-o-o-orge
!
Oh
,
jump
!
'
She
was
going
down
,
down
,
head
first
*NL*
under
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
raised
his
hand
deliberately
to
his
face
,
and
made
picking
motions
*NL*
with
his
fingers
as
though
he
had
been
bothered
with
cobwebs
,
and
*NL*
afterwards
he
looked
into
the
open
palm
for
quite
half
a
second
before
*NL*
he
blurted
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
had
jumped
...
''
He
checked
himself
,
averted
his
gaze
...
``
It
*NL*
seems
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
clear
blue
eyes
turned
to
me
with
a
piteous
stare
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
him
standing
before
me
,
dumfounded
and
hurt
,
I
was
oppressed
by
a
sad
*NL*
sense
of
resigned
wisdom
,
mingled
with
the
amused
and
profound
pity
of
*NL*
an
old
man
helpless
before
a
childish
disaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Looks
like
it
,
''
I
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
knew
nothing
about
it
till
I
looked
up
,
''
he
explained
hastily
.
And
*NL*
that
's
possible
,
too
.
You
had
to
listen
to
him
as
you
would
to
a
small
*NL*
boy
in
trouble
.
He
did
n't
know
.
It
had
happened
somehow
.
It
would
never
*NL*
happen
again
.
He
had
landed
partly
on
somebody
and
fallen
across
a
*NL*
thwart
.
He
felt
as
though
all
his
ribs
on
his
left
side
must
be
broken
;
*NL*
then
he
rolled
over
,
and
saw
vaguely
the
ship
he
had
deserted
uprising
*NL*
above
him
,
with
the
red
side-light
glowing
large
in
the
rain
like
a
fire
*NL*
on
the
brow
of
a
hill
seen
through
a
mist
.
``
She
seemed
higher
than
a
*NL*
wall
;
she
loomed
like
a
cliff
over
the
boat
...
I
wished
I
could
die
,
''
*NL*
he
cried
.
``
There
was
no
going
back
.
It
was
as
if
I
had
jumped
into
a
*NL*
well
--
into
an
everlasting
deep
hole
...

*NL*
CHAPTER
10
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
locked
his
fingers
together
and
tore
them
apart
.
Nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
true
:
he
had
indeed
jumped
into
an
everlasting
deep
hole
.
He
had
*NL*
tumbled
from
a
height
he
could
never
scale
again
.
By
that
time
the
boat
*NL*
had
gone
driving
forward
past
the
bows
.
It
was
too
dark
just
then
*NL*
for
them
to
see
each
other
,
and
,
moreover
,
they
were
blinded
and
half
*NL*
drowned
with
rain
.
He
told
me
it
was
like
being
swept
by
a
flood
through
*NL*
a
cavern
.
They
turned
their
backs
to
the
squall
;
the
skipper
,
it
seems
,
*NL*
got
an
oar
over
the
stern
to
keep
the
boat
before
it
,
and
for
two
or
*NL*
three
minutes
the
end
of
the
world
had
come
through
a
deluge
in
a
pitchy
*NL*
blackness
.
The
sea
hissed
``
like
twenty
thousand
kettles
.
''
That
's
his
*NL*
simile
,
not
mine
.
I
fancy
there
was
not
much
wind
after
the
first
gust
;
*NL*
and
he
himself
had
admitted
at
the
inquiry
that
the
sea
never
got
up
*NL*
that
night
to
any
extent
.
He
crouched
down
in
the
bows
and
stole
a
*NL*
furtive
glance
back
.
He
saw
just
one
yellow
gleam
of
the
mast-head
light
*NL*
high
up
and
blurred
like
a
last
star
ready
to
dissolve
.
``
It
terrified
me
*NL*
to
see
it
still
there
,
''
he
said
.
That
's
what
he
said
.
What
terrified
him
*NL*
was
the
thought
that
the
drowning
was
not
over
yet
.
No
doubt
he
wanted
*NL*
to
be
done
with
that
abomination
as
quickly
as
possible
.
Nobody
in
the
*NL*
boat
made
a
sound
.
In
the
dark
she
seemed
to
fly
,
but
of
course
she
*NL*
could
not
have
had
much
way
.
Then
the
shower
swept
ahead
,
and
the
great
,
*NL*
distracting
,
hissing
noise
followed
the
rain
into
distance
and
died
out
.
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
be
heard
then
but
the
slight
wash
about
the
boat
's
*NL*
sides
.
Somebody
's
teeth
were
chattering
violently
.
A
hand
touched
his
*NL*
back
.
A
faint
voice
said
,
``
You
there
?
''
Another
cried
out
shakily
,
*NL*
``
She
's
gone
!
''
and
they
all
stood
up
together
to
look
astern
.
They
saw
no
*NL*
lights
.
All
was
black
.
A
thin
cold
drizzle
was
driving
into
their
faces
.
*NL*
The
boat
lurched
slightly
.
The
teeth
chattered
faster
,
stopped
,
and
*NL*
began
again
twice
before
the
man
could
master
his
shiver
sufficiently
to
*NL*
say
,
``
Ju-ju-st
in
ti-ti-me
...
Brrrr
.
''
He
recognised
the
voice
of
the
*NL*
chief
engineer
saying
surlily
,
``
I
saw
her
go
down
.
I
happened
to
turn
my
*NL*
head
.
''
The
wind
had
dropped
almost
completely
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
watched
in
the
dark
with
their
heads
half
turned
to
windward
as
if
*NL*
expecting
to
hear
cries
.
At
first
he
was
thankful
the
night
had
covered
*NL*
up
the
scene
before
his
eyes
,
and
then
to
know
of
it
and
yet
to
have
*NL*
seen
and
heard
nothing
appeared
somehow
the
culminating
point
of
an
*NL*
awful
misfortune
.
``
Strange
,
is
n't
it
?
''
he
murmured
,
interrupting
himself
*NL*
in
his
disjointed
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
did
not
seem
so
strange
to
me
.
He
must
have
had
an
unconscious
*NL*
conviction
that
the
reality
could
not
be
half
as
bad
,
not
half
as
*NL*
anguishing
,
appalling
,
and
vengeful
as
the
created
terror
of
his
*NL*
imagination
.
I
believe
that
,
in
this
first
moment
,
his
heart
was
wrung
*NL*
with
all
the
suffering
,
that
his
soul
knew
the
accumulated
savour
of
all
*NL*
the
fear
,
all
the
horror
,
all
the
despair
of
eight
hundred
human
beings
*NL*
pounced
upon
in
the
night
by
a
sudden
and
violent
death
,
else
why
should
*NL*
he
have
said
,
``
It
seemed
to
me
that
I
must
jump
out
of
that
accursed
*NL*
boat
and
swim
back
to
see
--
half
a
mile
--
more
--
any
distance
--
to
the
very
*NL*
spot
...
''
?
Why
this
impulse
?
Do
you
see
the
significance
?
Why
back
to
*NL*
the
very
spot
?
Why
not
drown
alongside
--
if
he
meant
drowning
?
Why
back
*NL*
to
the
very
spot
,
to
see
--
as
if
his
imagination
had
to
be
soothed
by
the
*NL*
assurance
that
all
was
over
before
death
could
bring
relief
?
I
defy
any
*NL*
one
of
you
to
offer
another
explanation
.
It
was
one
of
those
bizarre
and
*NL*
exciting
glimpses
through
the
fog
.
It
was
an
extraordinary
disclosure
.
*NL*
He
let
it
out
as
the
most
natural
thing
one
could
say
.
He
fought
down
*NL*
that
impulse
and
then
he
became
conscious
of
the
silence
.
He
mentioned
*NL*
this
to
me
.
A
silence
of
the
sea
,
of
the
sky
,
merged
into
one
indefinite
*NL*
immensity
still
as
death
around
these
saved
,
palpitating
lives
.
*NL*
``
You
might
have
heard
a
pin
drop
in
the
boat
,
''
he
said
with
a
queer
*NL*
contraction
of
his
lips
,
like
a
man
trying
to
master
his
sensibilities
*NL*
while
relating
some
extremely
moving
fact
.
A
silence
!
God
alone
,
who
had
*NL*
willed
him
as
he
was
,
knows
what
he
made
of
it
in
his
heart
.
``
I
did
n't
*NL*
think
any
spot
on
earth
could
be
so
still
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
could
n't
*NL*
distinguish
the
sea
from
the
sky
;
there
was
nothing
to
see
and
nothing
*NL*
to
hear
.
Not
a
glimmer
,
not
a
shape
,
not
a
sound
.
You
could
have
*NL*
believed
that
every
bit
of
dry
land
had
gone
to
the
bottom
;
that
every
*NL*
man
on
earth
but
I
and
these
beggars
in
the
boat
had
got
drowned
.
''
He
*NL*
leaned
over
the
table
with
his
knuckles
propped
amongst
coffee-cups
,
*NL*
liqueur-glasses
,
cigar-ends
.
``
I
seemed
to
believe
it
.
Everything
was
*NL*
gone
and
--
all
was
over
...
''
he
fetched
a
deep
sigh
...
``
with
me
.
''
'
*NL*
*NL*
Marlow
sat
up
abruptly
and
flung
away
his
cheroot
with
force
.
It
made
*NL*
a
darting
red
trail
like
a
toy
rocket
fired
through
the
drapery
of
*NL*
creepers
.
Nobody
stirred
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Hey
,
what
do
you
think
of
it
?
'
he
cried
with
sudden
animation
.
`
Was
n't
*NL*
he
true
to
himself
,
was
n't
he
?
His
saved
life
was
over
for
want
of
*NL*
ground
under
his
feet
,
for
want
of
sights
for
his
eyes
,
for
want
of
*NL*
voices
in
his
ears
.
Annihilation
--
hey
!
And
all
the
time
it
was
only
a
*NL*
clouded
sky
,
a
sea
that
did
not
break
,
the
air
that
did
not
stir
.
Only
a
*NL*
night
;
only
a
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
lasted
for
a
while
,
and
then
they
were
suddenly
and
unanimously
*NL*
moved
to
make
a
noise
over
their
escape
.
``
I
knew
from
the
first
she
*NL*
would
go
.
''
``
Not
a
minute
too
soon
.
''
``
A
narrow
squeak
,
b
`
gosh
!
''
He
said
*NL*
nothing
,
but
the
breeze
that
had
dropped
came
back
,
a
gentle
draught
*NL*
freshened
steadily
,
and
the
sea
joined
its
murmuring
voice
to
this
*NL*
talkative
reaction
succeeding
the
dumb
moments
of
awe
.
She
was
gone
!
She
*NL*
was
gone
!
Not
a
doubt
of
it
.
Nobody
could
have
helped
.
They
repeated
the
*NL*
same
words
over
and
over
again
as
though
they
could
n't
stop
themselves
.
*NL*
Never
doubted
she
would
go
.
The
lights
were
gone
.
No
mistake
.
The
*NL*
lights
were
gone
.
Could
n't
expect
anything
else
.
She
had
to
go
...
He
*NL*
noticed
that
they
talked
as
though
they
had
left
behind
them
nothing
but
*NL*
an
empty
ship
.
They
concluded
she
would
not
have
been
long
when
she
once
*NL*
started
.
It
seemed
to
cause
them
some
sort
of
satisfaction
.
They
assured
*NL*
each
other
that
she
could
n't
have
been
long
about
it
--
``
Just
shot
down
*NL*
like
a
flat-iron
.
''
The
chief
engineer
declared
that
the
mast-head
light
*NL*
at
the
moment
of
sinking
seemed
to
drop
``
like
a
lighted
match
you
throw
*NL*
down
.
''
At
this
the
second
laughed
hysterically
.
``
I
am
g-g-glad
,
I
am
*NL*
gla-a-a-d
.
''
His
teeth
went
on
``
like
an
electric
rattle
,
''
said
Jim
,
*NL*
``
and
all
at
once
he
began
to
cry
.
He
wept
and
blubbered
like
a
child
,
*NL*
catching
his
breath
and
sobbing
`
Oh
dear
!
oh
dear
!
oh
dear
!
'
He
would
*NL*
be
quiet
for
a
while
and
start
suddenly
,
`
Oh
,
my
poor
arm
!
oh
,
my
poor
*NL*
a-a-a-arm
!
'
I
felt
I
could
knock
him
down
.
Some
of
them
sat
in
the
*NL*
stern-sheets
.
I
could
just
make
out
their
shapes
.
Voices
came
to
me
,
*NL*
mumble
,
mumble
,
grunt
,
grunt
.
All
this
seemed
very
hard
to
bear
.
I
was
*NL*
cold
too
.
And
I
could
do
nothing
.
I
thought
that
if
I
moved
I
would
have
*NL*
to
go
over
the
side
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
hand
groped
stealthily
,
came
in
contact
with
a
liqueur-glass
,
and
*NL*
was
withdrawn
suddenly
as
if
it
had
touched
a
red-hot
coal
.
I
pushed
the
*NL*
bottle
slightly
.
``
Wo
n't
you
have
some
more
?
''
I
asked
.
He
looked
at
me
*NL*
angrily
.
``
Do
n't
you
think
I
can
tell
you
what
there
is
to
tell
without
*NL*
screwing
myself
up
?
''
he
asked
.
The
squad
of
globe-trotters
had
gone
to
*NL*
bed
.
We
were
alone
but
for
a
vague
white
form
erect
in
the
shadow
,
that
,
*NL*
being
looked
at
,
cringed
forward
,
hesitated
,
backed
away
silently
.
It
*NL*
was
getting
late
,
but
I
did
not
hurry
my
guest
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
midst
of
his
forlorn
state
he
heard
his
companions
begin
to
*NL*
abuse
some
one
.
``
What
kept
you
from
jumping
,
you
lunatic
?
''
said
a
*NL*
scolding
voice
.
The
chief
engineer
left
the
stern-sheets
,
and
could
*NL*
be
heard
clambering
forward
as
if
with
hostile
intentions
against
``
the
*NL*
greatest
idiot
that
ever
was
.
''
The
skipper
shouted
with
rasping
effort
*NL*
offensive
epithets
from
where
he
sat
at
the
oar
.
He
lifted
his
head
*NL*
at
that
uproar
,
and
heard
the
name
``
George
,
''
while
a
hand
in
the
dark
*NL*
struck
him
on
the
breast
.
``
What
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
,
you
*NL*
fool
?
''
queried
somebody
,
with
a
sort
of
virtuous
fury
.
``
They
were
after
*NL*
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
They
were
abusing
me
--
abusing
me
...
by
the
name
of
*NL*
George
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
paused
to
stare
,
tried
to
smile
,
turned
his
eyes
away
and
went
on
.
*NL*
``
That
little
second
puts
his
head
right
under
my
nose
,
`
Why
,
it
's
that
*NL*
blasted
mate
!
'
`
What
!
'
howls
the
skipper
from
the
other
end
of
the
boat
.
*NL*
`
No
!
'
shrieks
the
chief
.
And
he
too
stooped
to
look
at
my
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
wind
had
left
the
boat
suddenly
.
The
rain
began
to
fall
again
,
and
*NL*
the
soft
,
uninterrupted
,
a
little
mysterious
sound
with
which
the
sea
*NL*
receives
a
shower
arose
on
all
sides
in
the
night
.
``
They
were
too
taken
*NL*
aback
to
say
anything
more
at
first
,
''
he
narrated
steadily
,
``
and
what
*NL*
could
I
have
to
say
to
them
?
''
He
faltered
for
a
moment
,
and
made
an
*NL*
effort
to
go
on
.
``
They
called
me
horrible
names
.
''
His
voice
,
sinking
to
*NL*
a
whisper
,
now
and
then
would
leap
up
suddenly
,
hardened
by
the
passion
*NL*
of
scorn
,
as
though
he
had
been
talking
of
secret
abominations
.
``
Never
*NL*
mind
what
they
called
me
,
''
he
said
grimly
.
``
I
could
hear
hate
in
their
*NL*
voices
.
A
good
thing
too
.
They
could
not
forgive
me
for
being
in
that
*NL*
boat
.
They
hated
it
.
It
made
them
mad
...
''
He
laughed
short
...
*NL*
``
But
it
kept
me
from
--
Look
!
I
was
sitting
with
my
arms
crossed
,
on
the
*NL*
gunwale
!
...
''
He
perched
himself
smartly
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
*NL*
crossed
his
arms
...
``
Like
this
--
see
?
One
little
tilt
backwards
and
*NL*
I
would
have
been
gone
--
after
the
others
.
One
little
tilt
--
the
least
*NL*
bit
--
the
least
bit
.
''
He
frowned
,
and
tapping
his
forehead
with
the
tip
*NL*
of
his
middle
finger
,
``
It
was
there
all
the
time
,
''
he
said
impressively
.
*NL*
``
All
the
time
--
that
notion
.
And
the
rain
--
cold
,
thick
,
cold
as
melted
*NL*
snow
--
colder
--
on
my
thin
cotton
clothes
--
I
'll
never
be
so
cold
again
in
*NL*
my
life
,
I
know
.
And
the
sky
was
black
too
--
all
black
.
Not
a
star
,
not
*NL*
a
light
anywhere
.
Nothing
outside
that
confounded
boat
and
those
two
*NL*
yapping
before
me
like
a
couple
of
mean
mongrels
at
a
tree
'd
thief
.
Yap
!
*NL*
yap
!
`
What
you
doing
here
?
You
're
a
fine
sort
!
Too
much
of
a
bloomin
'
*NL*
gentleman
to
put
your
hand
to
it
.
Come
out
of
your
trance
,
did
you
?
To
*NL*
sneak
in
?
Did
you
?
'
Yap
!
yap
!
`
You
ai
n't
fit
to
live
!
'
Yap
!
yap
!
Two
of
*NL*
them
together
trying
to
out-bark
each
other
.
The
other
would
bay
from
*NL*
the
stern
through
the
rain
--
could
n't
see
him
--
could
n't
make
it
out
--
some
*NL*
of
his
filthy
jargon
.
Yap
!
yap
!
Bow-ow-ow-ow-ow
!
Yap
!
yap
!
It
was
sweet
*NL*
to
hear
them
;
it
kept
me
alive
,
I
tell
you
.
It
saved
my
life
.
At
it
they
*NL*
went
,
as
if
trying
to
drive
me
overboard
with
the
noise
!
...
'
I
wonder
*NL*
you
had
pluck
enough
to
jump
.
You
ai
n't
wanted
here
.
If
I
had
known
who
*NL*
it
was
,
I
would
have
tipped
you
over
--
you
skunk
!
What
have
you
done
with
*NL*
the
other
?
Where
did
you
get
the
pluck
to
jump
--
you
coward
?
What
's
to
*NL*
prevent
us
three
from
firing
you
overboard
?
'
...
They
were
out
of
*NL*
breath
;
the
shower
passed
away
upon
the
sea
.
Then
nothing
.
There
was
*NL*
nothing
round
the
boat
,
not
even
a
sound
.
Wanted
to
see
me
overboard
,
*NL*
did
they
?
Upon
my
soul
!
I
think
they
would
have
had
their
wish
if
they
*NL*
had
only
kept
quiet
.
Fire
me
overboard
!
Would
they
?
`
Try
,
'
I
said
.
'
I
*NL*
would
for
twopence
.
'
`
Too
good
for
you
,
'
they
screeched
together
.
It
was
*NL*
so
dark
that
it
was
only
when
one
or
the
other
of
them
moved
that
I
was
*NL*
quite
sure
of
seeing
him
.
By
heavens
!
I
only
wish
they
had
tried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
could
n't
help
exclaiming
,
``
What
an
extraordinary
affair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Not
bad
--
eh
?
''
he
said
,
as
if
in
some
sort
astounded
.
``
They
pretended
*NL*
to
think
I
had
done
away
with
that
donkey-man
for
some
reason
or
other
.
*NL*
Why
should
I
?
And
how
the
devil
was
I
to
know
?
Did
n't
I
get
somehow
*NL*
into
that
boat
?
into
that
boat
--
I
...
''
The
muscles
round
his
lips
*NL*
contracted
into
an
unconscious
grimace
that
tore
through
the
mask
of
his
*NL*
usual
expression
--
something
violent
,
short-lived
and
illuminating
like
*NL*
a
twist
of
lightning
that
admits
the
eye
for
an
instant
into
the
secret
*NL*
convolutions
of
a
cloud
.
``
I
did
.
I
was
plainly
there
with
them
--
was
n't
*NL*
I
?
Is
n't
it
awful
a
man
should
be
driven
to
do
a
thing
like
that
--
and
be
*NL*
responsible
?
What
did
I
know
about
their
George
they
were
howling
after
?
*NL*
I
remembered
I
had
seen
him
curled
up
on
the
deck
.
`
Murdering
coward
!
'
*NL*
the
chief
kept
on
calling
me
.
He
did
n't
seem
able
to
remember
any
other
*NL*
two
words
.
I
did
n't
care
,
only
his
noise
began
to
worry
me
.
`
Shut
up
,
'
I
*NL*
said
.
At
that
he
collected
himself
for
a
confounded
screech
.
`
You
killed
*NL*
him
!
You
killed
him
!
'
`
No
,
'
I
shouted
,
`
but
I
will
kill
you
directly
.
'
I
*NL*
jumped
up
,
and
he
fell
backwards
over
a
thwart
with
an
awful
loud
thump
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
know
why
.
Too
dark
.
Tried
to
step
back
I
suppose
.
I
stood
still
*NL*
facing
aft
,
and
the
wretched
little
second
began
to
whine
,
`
You
*NL*
ai
n't
going
to
hit
a
chap
with
a
broken
arm
--
and
you
call
yourself
a
*NL*
gentleman
,
too
.
'
I
heard
a
heavy
tramp
--
one
--
two
--
and
wheezy
grunting
.
*NL*
The
other
beast
was
coming
at
me
,
clattering
his
oar
over
the
stern
.
I
*NL*
saw
him
moving
,
big
,
big
--
as
you
see
a
man
in
a
mist
,
in
a
dream
.
`
Come
*NL*
on
,
'
I
cried
.
I
would
have
tumbled
him
over
like
a
bale
of
shakings
.
He
*NL*
stopped
,
muttered
to
himself
,
and
went
back
.
Perhaps
he
had
heard
the
*NL*
wind
.
I
did
n't
.
It
was
the
last
heavy
gust
we
had
.
He
went
back
to
his
*NL*
oar
.
I
was
sorry
.
I
would
have
tried
to
--
to
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
opened
and
closed
his
curved
fingers
,
and
his
hands
had
an
eager
and
*NL*
cruel
flutter
.
``
Steady
,
steady
,
''
I
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Eh
?
What
?
I
am
not
excited
,
''
he
remonstrated
,
awfully
hurt
,
and
with
*NL*
a
convulsive
jerk
of
his
elbow
knocked
over
the
cognac
bottle
.
I
started
*NL*
forward
,
scraping
my
chair
.
He
bounced
off
the
table
as
if
a
mine
had
*NL*
been
exploded
behind
his
back
,
and
half
turned
before
he
alighted
,
*NL*
crouching
on
his
feet
to
show
me
a
startled
pair
of
eyes
and
a
face
*NL*
white
about
the
nostrils
.
A
look
of
intense
annoyance
succeeded
.
*NL*
``
Awfully
sorry
.
How
clumsy
of
me
!
''
he
mumbled
,
very
vexed
,
while
the
*NL*
pungent
odour
of
spilt
alcohol
enveloped
us
suddenly
with
an
atmosphere
*NL*
of
a
low
drinking-bout
in
the
cool
,
pure
darkness
of
the
night
.
The
*NL*
lights
had
been
put
out
in
the
dining-hall
;
our
candle
glimmered
*NL*
solitary
in
the
long
gallery
,
and
the
columns
had
turned
black
from
*NL*
pediment
to
capital
.
On
the
vivid
stars
the
high
corner
of
the
Harbour
*NL*
Office
stood
out
distinct
across
the
Esplanade
,
as
though
the
sombre
*NL*
pile
had
glided
nearer
to
see
and
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
assumed
an
air
of
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
dare
say
I
am
less
calm
now
than
I
was
then
.
I
was
ready
for
*NL*
anything
.
These
were
trifles
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
had
a
lively
time
of
it
in
that
boat
,
''
I
remarked
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
was
ready
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
After
the
ship
's
lights
had
gone
,
anything
*NL*
might
have
happened
in
that
boat
--
anything
in
the
world
--
and
the
world
*NL*
no
wiser
.
I
felt
this
,
and
I
was
pleased
.
It
was
just
dark
enough
too
.
*NL*
We
were
like
men
walled
up
quick
in
a
roomy
grave
.
No
concern
with
*NL*
anything
on
earth
.
Nobody
to
pass
an
opinion
.
Nothing
mattered
.
''
For
the
*NL*
third
time
during
this
conversation
he
laughed
harshly
,
but
there
was
*NL*
no
one
about
to
suspect
him
of
being
only
drunk
.
``
No
fear
,
no
law
,
no
*NL*
sounds
,
no
eyes
--
not
even
our
own
,
till
--
till
sunrise
at
least
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
struck
by
the
suggestive
truth
of
his
words
.
There
is
something
*NL*
peculiar
in
a
small
boat
upon
the
wide
sea
.
Over
the
lives
borne
from
*NL*
under
the
shadow
of
death
there
seems
to
fall
the
shadow
of
madness
.
*NL*
When
your
ship
fails
you
,
your
whole
world
seems
to
fail
you
;
the
world
*NL*
that
made
you
,
restrained
you
,
took
care
of
you
.
It
is
as
if
the
souls
*NL*
of
men
floating
on
an
abyss
and
in
touch
with
immensity
had
been
set
*NL*
free
for
any
excess
of
heroism
,
absurdity
,
or
abomination
.
Of
course
,
as
*NL*
with
belief
,
thought
,
love
,
hate
,
conviction
,
or
even
the
visual
aspect
*NL*
of
material
things
,
there
are
as
many
shipwrecks
as
there
are
men
,
and
*NL*
in
this
one
there
was
something
abject
which
made
the
isolation
more
*NL*
complete
--
there
was
a
villainy
of
circumstances
that
cut
these
men
off
*NL*
more
completely
from
the
rest
of
mankind
,
whose
ideal
of
conduct
had
*NL*
never
undergone
the
trial
of
a
fiendish
and
appalling
joke
.
They
were
*NL*
exasperated
with
him
for
being
a
half-hearted
shirker
:
he
focussed
on
*NL*
them
his
hatred
of
the
whole
thing
;
he
would
have
liked
to
take
a
signal
*NL*
revenge
for
the
abhorrent
opportunity
they
had
put
in
his
way
.
Trust
*NL*
a
boat
on
the
high
seas
to
bring
out
the
Irrational
that
lurks
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
every
thought
,
sentiment
,
sensation
,
emotion
.
It
was
part
of
*NL*
the
burlesque
meanness
pervading
that
particular
disaster
at
sea
that
*NL*
they
did
not
come
to
blows
.
It
was
all
threats
,
all
a
terribly
effective
*NL*
feint
,
a
sham
from
beginning
to
end
,
planned
by
the
tremendous
disdain
*NL*
of
the
Dark
Powers
whose
real
terrors
,
always
on
the
verge
of
triumph
,
*NL*
are
perpetually
foiled
by
the
steadfastness
of
men
.
I
asked
,
after
*NL*
waiting
for
a
while
,
``
Well
,
what
happened
?
''
A
futile
question
.
I
knew
*NL*
too
much
already
to
hope
for
the
grace
of
a
single
uplifting
touch
,
for
*NL*
the
favour
of
hinted
madness
,
of
shadowed
horror
.
``
Nothing
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
*NL*
meant
business
,
but
they
meant
noise
only
.
Nothing
happened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
the
rising
sun
found
him
just
as
he
had
jumped
up
first
in
the
bows
*NL*
of
the
boat
.
What
a
persistence
of
readiness
!
He
had
been
holding
the
*NL*
tiller
in
his
hand
,
too
,
all
the
night
.
They
had
dropped
the
rudder
*NL*
overboard
while
attempting
to
ship
it
,
and
I
suppose
the
tiller
got
*NL*
kicked
forward
somehow
while
they
were
rushing
up
and
down
that
boat
*NL*
trying
to
do
all
sorts
of
things
at
once
so
as
to
get
clear
of
the
*NL*
side
.
It
was
a
long
heavy
piece
of
hard
wood
,
and
apparently
he
had
been
*NL*
clutching
it
for
six
hours
or
so
.
If
you
do
n't
call
that
being
ready
!
*NL*
Can
you
imagine
him
,
silent
and
on
his
feet
half
the
night
,
his
face
to
*NL*
the
gusts
of
rain
,
staring
at
sombre
forms
watchful
of
vague
movements
,
*NL*
straining
his
ears
to
catch
rare
low
murmurs
in
the
stern-sheets
!
*NL*
Firmness
of
courage
or
effort
of
fear
?
What
do
you
think
?
And
the
*NL*
endurance
is
undeniable
too
.
Six
hours
more
or
less
on
the
defensive
;
*NL*
six
hours
of
alert
immobility
while
the
boat
drove
slowly
or
floated
*NL*
arrested
,
according
to
the
caprice
of
the
wind
;
while
the
sea
,
calmed
,
*NL*
slept
at
last
;
while
the
clouds
passed
above
his
head
;
while
the
sky
*NL*
from
an
immensity
lustreless
and
black
,
diminished
to
a
sombre
and
*NL*
lustrous
vault
,
scintillated
with
a
greater
brilliance
,
faded
to
the
*NL*
east
,
paled
at
the
zenith
;
while
the
dark
shapes
blotting
the
low
*NL*
stars
astern
got
outlines
,
relief
became
shoulders
,
heads
,
faces
,
*NL*
features
,
--
confronted
him
with
dreary
stares
,
had
dishevelled
hair
,
torn
*NL*
clothes
,
blinked
red
eyelids
at
the
white
dawn
.
``
They
looked
as
though
*NL*
they
had
been
knocking
about
drunk
in
gutters
for
a
week
,
''
he
described
*NL*
graphically
;
and
then
he
muttered
something
about
the
sunrise
being
of
a
*NL*
kind
that
foretells
a
calm
day
.
You
know
that
sailor
habit
of
referring
*NL*
to
the
weather
in
every
connection
.
And
on
my
side
his
few
mumbled
words
*NL*
were
enough
to
make
me
see
the
lower
limb
of
the
sun
clearing
the
*NL*
line
of
the
horizon
,
the
tremble
of
a
vast
ripple
running
over
all
the
*NL*
visible
expanse
of
the
sea
,
as
if
the
waters
had
shuddered
,
giving
birth
*NL*
to
the
globe
of
light
,
while
the
last
puff
of
the
breeze
would
stir
the
*NL*
air
in
a
sigh
of
relief
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
They
sat
in
the
stern
shoulder
to
shoulder
,
with
the
skipper
in
the
*NL*
middle
,
like
three
dirty
owls
,
and
stared
at
me
,
''
I
heard
him
say
*NL*
with
an
intention
of
hate
that
distilled
a
corrosive
virtue
into
the
*NL*
commonplace
words
like
a
drop
of
powerful
poison
falling
into
a
glass
*NL*
of
water
;
but
my
thoughts
dwelt
upon
that
sunrise
.
I
could
imagine
*NL*
under
the
pellucid
emptiness
of
the
sky
these
four
men
imprisoned
in
the
*NL*
solitude
of
the
sea
,
the
lonely
sun
,
regardless
of
the
speck
of
life
,
*NL*
ascending
the
clear
curve
of
the
heaven
as
if
to
gaze
ardently
from
a
*NL*
greater
height
at
his
own
splendour
reflected
in
the
still
ocean
.
``
They
*NL*
called
out
to
me
from
aft
,
''
said
Jim
,
``
as
though
we
had
been
chums
*NL*
together
.
I
heard
them
.
They
were
begging
me
to
be
sensible
and
drop
*NL*
that
`
blooming
piece
of
wood
.
'
Why
_
would
_
I
carry
on
so
?
They
had
n't
*NL*
done
me
any
harm
--
had
they
?
There
had
been
no
harm
...
No
harm
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
face
crimsoned
as
though
he
could
not
get
rid
of
the
air
in
his
*NL*
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
No
harm
!
''
he
burst
out
.
``
I
leave
it
to
you
.
You
can
understand
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
you
?
You
see
it
--
do
n't
you
?
No
harm
!
Good
God
!
What
more
could
they
have
*NL*
done
?
Oh
yes
,
I
know
very
well
--
I
jumped
.
Certainly
.
I
jumped
!
I
told
*NL*
you
I
jumped
;
but
I
tell
you
they
were
too
much
for
any
man
.
It
was
*NL*
their
doing
as
plainly
as
if
they
had
reached
up
with
a
boat-hook
and
*NL*
pulled
me
over
.
Ca
n't
you
see
it
?
You
must
see
it
.
Come
.
Speak
--
straight
*NL*
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
uneasy
eyes
fastened
upon
mine
,
questioned
,
begged
,
challenged
,
*NL*
entreated
.
For
the
life
of
me
I
could
n't
help
murmuring
,
``
You
've
been
*NL*
tried
.
''
``
More
than
is
fair
,
''
he
caught
up
swiftly
.
``
I
was
n't
given
half
*NL*
a
chance
--
with
a
gang
like
that
.
And
now
they
were
friendly
--
oh
,
so
*NL*
damnably
friendly
!
Chums
,
shipmates
.
All
in
the
same
boat
.
Make
the
best
*NL*
of
it
.
They
had
n't
meant
anything
.
They
did
n't
care
a
hang
for
George
.
*NL*
George
had
gone
back
to
his
berth
for
something
at
the
last
moment
and
*NL*
got
caught
.
The
man
was
a
manifest
fool
.
Very
sad
,
of
course
...
*NL*
Their
eyes
looked
at
me
;
their
lips
moved
;
they
wagged
their
heads
at
*NL*
the
other
end
of
the
boat
--
three
of
them
;
they
beckoned
--
to
me
.
Why
*NL*
not
?
Had
n't
I
jumped
?
I
said
nothing
.
There
are
no
words
for
the
sort
of
*NL*
things
I
wanted
to
say
.
If
I
had
opened
my
lips
just
then
I
would
have
*NL*
simply
howled
like
an
animal
.
I
was
asking
myself
when
I
would
wake
up
.
*NL*
They
urged
me
aloud
to
come
aft
and
hear
quietly
what
the
skipper
had
to
*NL*
say
.
We
were
sure
to
be
picked
up
before
the
evening
--
right
in
the
track
*NL*
of
all
the
Canal
traffic
;
there
was
smoke
to
the
north-west
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
gave
me
an
awful
shock
to
see
this
faint
,
faint
blur
,
this
low
*NL*
trail
of
brown
mist
through
which
you
could
see
the
boundary
of
sea
and
*NL*
sky
.
I
called
out
to
them
that
I
could
hear
very
well
where
I
was
.
The
*NL*
skipper
started
swearing
,
as
hoarse
as
a
crow
.
He
was
n't
going
to
talk
*NL*
at
the
top
of
his
voice
for
_
my
_
accommodation
.
`
Are
you
afraid
they
*NL*
will
hear
you
on
shore
?
'
I
asked
.
He
glared
as
if
he
would
have
liked
to
*NL*
claw
me
to
pieces
.
The
chief
engineer
advised
him
to
humour
me
.
He
*NL*
said
I
was
n't
right
in
my
head
yet
.
The
other
rose
astern
,
like
a
thick
*NL*
pillar
of
flesh
--
and
talked
--
talked
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
remained
thoughtful
.
``
Well
?
''
I
said
.
``
What
did
I
care
what
story
*NL*
they
agreed
to
make
up
?
''
he
cried
recklessly
.
``
They
could
tell
what
they
*NL*
jolly
well
liked
.
It
was
their
business
.
I
knew
the
story
.
Nothing
*NL*
they
could
make
people
believe
could
alter
it
for
me
.
I
let
him
talk
,
*NL*
argue
--
talk
,
argue
.
He
went
on
and
on
and
on
.
Suddenly
I
felt
my
legs
*NL*
give
way
under
me
.
I
was
sick
,
tired
--
tired
to
death
.
I
let
fall
the
*NL*
tiller
,
turned
my
back
on
them
,
and
sat
down
on
the
foremost
thwart
.
I
*NL*
had
enough
.
They
called
to
me
to
know
if
I
understood
--
was
n't
it
true
,
*NL*
every
word
of
it
?
It
was
true
,
by
God
!
after
their
fashion
.
I
did
not
*NL*
turn
my
head
.
I
heard
them
palavering
together
.
`
The
silly
ass
wo
n't
say
*NL*
anything
.
'
`
Oh
,
he
understands
well
enough
.
'
`
Let
him
be
;
he
will
be
all
*NL*
right
.
'
`
What
can
he
do
?
'
What
could
I
do
?
Were
n't
we
all
in
the
same
*NL*
boat
?
I
tried
to
be
deaf
.
The
smoke
had
disappeared
to
the
northward
.
*NL*
It
was
a
dead
calm
.
They
had
a
drink
from
the
water-breaker
,
and
I
drank
*NL*
too
.
Afterwards
they
made
a
great
business
of
spreading
the
boat-sail
*NL*
over
the
gunwales
.
Would
I
keep
a
look-out
?
They
crept
under
,
out
of
my
*NL*
sight
,
thank
God
!
I
felt
weary
,
weary
,
done
up
,
as
if
I
had
n't
had
one
*NL*
hour
's
sleep
since
the
day
I
was
born
.
I
could
n't
see
the
water
for
the
*NL*
glitter
of
the
sunshine
.
From
time
to
time
one
of
them
would
creep
out
,
*NL*
stand
up
to
take
a
look
all
round
,
and
get
under
again
.
I
could
hear
*NL*
spells
of
snoring
below
the
sail
.
Some
of
them
could
sleep
.
One
of
them
*NL*
at
least
.
I
could
n't
!
All
was
light
,
light
,
and
the
boat
seemed
to
be
*NL*
falling
through
it
.
Now
and
then
I
would
feel
quite
surprised
to
find
*NL*
myself
sitting
on
a
thwart
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
began
to
walk
with
measured
steps
to
and
fro
before
my
chair
,
one
*NL*
hand
in
his
trousers-pocket
,
his
head
bent
thoughtfully
,
and
his
right
*NL*
arm
at
long
intervals
raised
for
a
gesture
that
seemed
to
put
out
of
his
*NL*
way
an
invisible
intruder
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
suppose
you
think
I
was
going
mad
,
''
he
began
in
a
changed
tone
.
``
And
*NL*
well
you
may
,
if
you
remember
I
had
lost
my
cap
.
The
sun
crept
all
the
*NL*
way
from
east
to
west
over
my
bare
head
,
but
that
day
I
could
not
come
*NL*
to
any
harm
,
I
suppose
.
The
sun
could
not
make
me
mad

''
His
right
*NL*
arm
put
aside
the
idea
of
madness
...
``
Neither
could
it
kill
*NL*
me
...
''
Again
his
arm
repulsed
a
shadow
...
''
_
That
_
rested
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Did
it
?
''
I
said
,
inexpressibly
amazed
at
this
new
turn
,
and
I
looked
*NL*
at
him
with
the
same
sort
of
feeling
I
might
be
fairly
conceived
to
*NL*
experience
had
he
,
after
spinning
round
on
his
heel
,
presented
an
*NL*
altogether
new
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
did
n't
get
brain
fever
,
I
did
not
drop
dead
either
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
*NL*
did
n't
bother
myself
at
all
about
the
sun
over
my
head
.
I
was
thinking
*NL*
as
coolly
as
any
man
that
ever
sat
thinking
in
the
shade
.
That
greasy
*NL*
beast
of
a
skipper
poked
his
big
cropped
head
from
under
the
canvas
*NL*
and
screwed
his
fishy
eyes
up
at
me
.
`
Donnerwetter
!
you
will
die

'
he
*NL*
growled
,
and
drew
in
like
a
turtle
.
I
had
seen
him
.
I
had
heard
him
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
interrupt
me
.
I
was
thinking
just
then
that
I
would
n't
.

*NL*
*NL*
`
He
tried
to
sound
my
thought
with
an
attentive
glance
dropped
on
me
*NL*
in
passing
.
``
Do
you
mean
to
say
you
had
been
deliberating
with
yourself
*NL*
whether
you
would
die
?
''
I
asked
in
as
impenetrable
a
tone
as
I
could
*NL*
command
.
He
nodded
without
stopping
.
``
Yes
,
it
had
come
to
that
as
I
sat
*NL*
there
alone
,
''
he
said
.
He
passed
on
a
few
steps
to
the
imaginary
end
*NL*
of
his
beat
,
and
when
he
flung
round
to
come
back
both
his
hands
were
*NL*
thrust
deep
into
his
pockets
.
He
stopped
short
in
front
of
my
chair
and
*NL*
looked
down
.
``
Do
n't
you
believe
it
?
''
he
inquired
with
tense
curiosity
.
*NL*
I
was
moved
to
make
a
solemn
declaration
of
my
readiness
to
believe
*NL*
implicitly
anything
he
thought
fit
to
tell
me

CHAPTER
11
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
heard
me
out
with
his
head
on
one
side
,
and
I
had
another
glimpse
*NL*
through
a
rent
in
the
mist
in
which
he
moved
and
had
his
being
.
The
dim
*NL*
candle
spluttered
within
the
ball
of
glass
,
and
that
was
all
I
had
to
*NL*
see
him
by
;
at
his
back
was
the
dark
night
with
the
clear
stars
,
whose
*NL*
distant
glitter
disposed
in
retreating
planes
lured
the
eye
into
the
*NL*
depths
of
a
greater
darkness
;
and
yet
a
mysterious
light
seemed
to
show
*NL*
me
his
boyish
head
,
as
if
in
that
moment
the
youth
within
him
had
,
for
*NL*
a
moment
,
glowed
and
expired
.
``
You
are
an
awful
good
sort
to
listen
like
*NL*
this
,
''
he
said
.
``
It
does
me
good
.
You
do
n't
know
what
it
is
to
me
.
You
*NL*
do
n't
''
...
words
seemed
to
fail
him
.
It
was
a
distinct
glimpse
.
He
was
*NL*
a
youngster
of
the
sort
you
like
to
see
about
you
;
of
the
sort
you
like
*NL*
to
imagine
yourself
to
have
been
;
of
the
sort
whose
appearance
claims
*NL*
the
fellowship
of
these
illusions
you
had
thought
gone
out
,
extinct
,
*NL*
cold
,
and
which
,
as
if
rekindled
at
the
approach
of
another
flame
,
give
*NL*
a
flutter
deep
,
deep
down
somewhere
,
give
a
flutter
of
light
...
of
*NL*
heat
!
...
Yes
;
I
had
a
glimpse
of
him
then
...
and
it
was
not
the
*NL*
last
of
that
kind
...
``
You
do
n't
know
what
it
is
for
a
fellow
in
my
*NL*
position
to
be
believed
--
make
a
clean
breast
of
it
to
an
elder
man
.
It
*NL*
is
so
difficult
--
so
awfully
unfair
--
so
hard
to
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
mists
were
closing
again
.
I
do
n't
know
how
old
I
appeared
to
*NL*
him
--
and
how
much
wise
.
Not
half
as
old
as
I
felt
just
then
;
not
half
*NL*
as
uselessly
wise
as
I
knew
myself
to
be
.
Surely
in
no
other
craft
as
in
*NL*
that
of
the
sea
do
the
hearts
of
those
already
launched
to
sink
or
swim
*NL*
go
out
so
much
to
the
youth
on
the
brink
,
looking
with
shining
eyes
upon
*NL*
that
glitter
of
the
vast
surface
which
is
only
a
reflection
of
his
*NL*
own
glances
full
of
fire
.
There
is
such
magnificent
vagueness
in
*NL*
the
expectations
that
had
driven
each
of
us
to
sea
,
such
a
glorious
*NL*
indefiniteness
,
such
a
beautiful
greed
of
adventures
that
are
their
own
*NL*
and
only
reward
.
What
we
get
--
well
,
we
wo
n't
talk
of
that
;
but
can
one
*NL*
of
us
restrain
a
smile
?
In
no
other
kind
of
life
is
the
illusion
more
*NL*
wide
of
reality
--
in
no
other
is
the
beginning
_
all
_
illusion
--
the
*NL*
disenchantment
more
swift
--
the
subjugation
more
complete
.
Had
n't
we
all
*NL*
commenced
with
the
same
desire
,
ended
with
the
same
knowledge
,
carried
*NL*
the
memory
of
the
same
cherished
glamour
through
the
sordid
days
of
*NL*
imprecation
?
What
wonder
that
when
some
heavy
prod
gets
home
the
bond
*NL*
is
found
to
be
close
;
that
besides
the
fellowship
of
the
craft
there
is
*NL*
felt
the
strength
of
a
wider
feeling
--
the
feeling
that
binds
a
man
to
a
*NL*
child
.
He
was
there
before
me
,
believing
that
age
and
wisdom
can
find
*NL*
a
remedy
against
the
pain
of
truth
,
giving
me
a
glimpse
of
himself
as
a
*NL*
young
fellow
in
a
scrape
that
is
the
very
devil
of
a
scrape
,
the
sort
*NL*
of
scrape
greybeards
wag
at
solemnly
while
they
hide
a
smile
.
And
he
*NL*
had
been
deliberating
upon
death
--
confound
him
!
He
had
found
that
to
*NL*
meditate
about
because
he
thought
he
had
saved
his
life
,
while
all
its
*NL*
glamour
had
gone
with
the
ship
in
the
night
.
What
more
natural
!
It
*NL*
was
tragic
enough
and
funny
enough
in
all
conscience
to
call
aloud
for
*NL*
compassion
,
and
in
what
was
I
better
than
the
rest
of
us
to
refuse
him
*NL*
my
pity
?
And
even
as
I
looked
at
him
the
mists
rolled
into
the
rent
,
and
*NL*
his
voice
spoke
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
was
so
lost
,
you
know
.
It
was
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
not
expect
*NL*
to
happen
to
one
.
It
was
not
like
a
fight
,
for
instance
.

*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
was
not
,

I
admitted
.
He
appeared
changed
,
as
if
he
had
suddenly
*NL*
matured
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
One
could
n't
be
sure
,
''
he
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Ah
!
You
were
not
sure
,
''
I
said
,
and
was
placated
by
the
sound
of
*NL*
a
faint
sigh
that
passed
between
us
like
the
flight
of
a
bird
in
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Well
,
I
was
n't
,
''
he
said
courageously
.
``
It
was
something
like
that
*NL*
wretched
story
they
made
up
.
It
was
not
a
lie
--
but
it
was
n't
truth
all
*NL*
the
same
.
It
was
something
...
One
knows
a
downright
lie
.
There
was
*NL*
not
the
thickness
of
a
sheet
of
paper
between
the
right
and
the
wrong
of
*NL*
this
affair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
How
much
more
did
you
want
?
''
I
asked
;
but
I
think
I
spoke
so
low
that
*NL*
he
did
not
catch
what
I
said
.
He
had
advanced
his
argument
as
though
*NL*
life
had
been
a
network
of
paths
separated
by
chasms
.
His
voice
sounded
*NL*
reasonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Suppose
I
had
not

I
mean
to
say
,

I
had
stuck
to
the
ship

How
much
longer
?
Say
a
minute
--
half
a
minute
.
Come
.
In
thirty
*NL*
seconds
,
as
it
seemed
certain
then
,
I
would
have
been
overboard
;
and
do
*NL*
you
think
I
would
not
have
laid
hold
of
the
first
thing
that
came
in
my
*NL*
way

oar

life-buoy
,
grating
--
anything
?
Would
n't
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
be
saved

''
I
interjected
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
would
have
meant
to
be

''
he
retorted
.
``
And
that
's
more
than
I
meant
*NL*
when
I

...
he
shivered
as
if
about
to
swallow
some
nauseous
*NL*
drug
...
``
jumped
,

he
pronounced
with
a
convulsive
effort
,
whose
*NL*
stress
,
as
if
propagated
by
the
waves
of
the
air
,
made
my
body
stir
a
*NL*
little
in
the
chair
.
He
fixed
me
with
lowering
eyes
.
``
Do
n't
you
believe
*NL*
me
?
''
he
cried
.
``
I
swear
!
...
Confound
it
!
You
got
me
here
to
talk

*NL*

You
must
!
...
You
said
you
would
believe

''
``
Of
course
I
do
,
''
*NL*
I
protested
,
in
a
matter-of-fact
tone
which
produced
a
calming
effect
.
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
''
he
said
.
``
Of
course
I
would
n't
have
talked
to
you
about
*NL*
all
this
if
you
had
not
been
a
gentleman
.
I
ought
to
have
known

I
*NL*
am
--
I
am
--
a
gentleman
too
...
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
I
said
hastily
.
He
was
*NL*
looking
me
squarely
in
the
face
,
and
withdrew
his
gaze
slowly
.
``
Now
you
*NL*
understand
why
I
did
n't
after
all
...
did
n't
go
out
in
that
way

I
*NL*
was
n't
going
to
be
frightened
at
what
I
had
done
.
And
,
anyhow
,
if
I
had
*NL*
stuck
to
the
ship
I
would
have
done
my
best
to
be
saved
.
Men
have
been
*NL*
known
to
float
for
hours
--
in
the
open
sea

and
be
picked
up
not
much
the
*NL*
worse
for
it

I
might
have
lasted
it
out
better
than
many
others

*NL*
There
's
nothing
the
matter
with
my
heart
.
''
He
withdrew
his
right
fist
*NL*
from
his
pocket
,
and
the
blow
he
struck
on
his
chest
resounded
like
a
*NL*
muffled
detonation
in
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
No
,
''
I
said
.
He
meditated
,
with
his
legs
slightly
apart
and
his
*NL*
chin
sunk
.
``
A
hair
's
-
breadth
,
''
he
muttered
.
``
Not
the
breadth
of
a
hair
*NL*
between
this
and
that
.
And
at
the
time
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
is
difficult
to
see
a
hair
at
midnight
,
''
I
put
in
,
a
little
*NL*
viciously
I
fear
.
Do
n't
you
see
what
I
mean
by
the
solidarity
of
the
*NL*
craft
?
I
was
aggrieved
against
him
,
as
though
he
had
cheated
me
--
me
!
--
of
*NL*
a
splendid
opportunity
to
keep
up
the
illusion
of
my
beginnings
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
robbed
our
common
life
of
the
last
spark
of
its
glamour
.
*NL*
``
And
so
you
cleared
out
--
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Jumped
,
''
he
corrected
me
incisively
.
``
Jumped
--
mind
!
''
he
repeated
,
and
*NL*
I
wondered
at
the
evident
but
obscure
intention
.
``
Well
,
yes
!
Perhaps
I
*NL*
could
not
see
then
.
But
I
had
plenty
of
time
and
any
amount
of
light
*NL*
in
that
boat
.
And
I
could
think
,
too
.
Nobody
would
know
,
of
course
,
but
*NL*
this
did
not
make
it
any
easier
for
me
.
You
've
got
to
believe
that
,
too
.
*NL*
I
did
not
want
all
this
talk
...
No
...
Yes
...
I
wo
n't
*NL*
lie
...
I
wanted
it
:
it
is
the
very
thing
I
wanted
--
there
.
Do
you
*NL*
think
you
or
anybody
could
have
made
me
if
I
...
I
am
--
I
am
not
afraid
*NL*
to
tell
.
And
I
was
n't
afraid
to
think
either
.
I
looked
it
in
the
face
.
I
*NL*
was
n't
going
to
run
away
.
At
first
--
at
night
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
*NL*
those
fellows
I
might
have
...
No
!
by
heavens
!
I
was
not
going
to
give
*NL*
them
that
satisfaction
.
They
had
done
enough
.
They
made
up
a
story
,
and
*NL*
believed
it
for
all
I
know
.
But
I
knew
the
truth
,
and
I
would
live
it
*NL*
down
--
alone
,
with
myself
.
I
was
n't
going
to
give
in
to
such
a
beastly
*NL*
unfair
thing
.
What
did
it
prove
after
all
?
I
was
confoundedly
cut
up
.
*NL*
Sick
of
life
--
to
tell
you
the
truth
;
but
what
would
have
been
the
good
*NL*
to
shirk
it
--
in
--
in
--
that
way
?
That
was
not
the
way
.
I
believe
--
I
*NL*
believe
it
would
have
--
it
would
have
ended
--
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
been
walking
up
and
down
,
but
with
the
last
word
he
turned
short
*NL*
at
me
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
do
_
you
_
believe
?
''
he
asked
with
violence
.
A
pause
ensued
,
and
*NL*
suddenly
I
felt
myself
overcome
by
a
profound
and
hopeless
fatigue
,
as
*NL*
though
his
voice
had
startled
me
out
of
a
dream
of
wandering
through
*NL*
empty
spaces
whose
immensity
had
harassed
my
soul
and
exhausted
my
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
''
...
Would
have
ended
nothing
,
''
he
muttered
over
me
obstinately
,
*NL*
after
a
little
while
.
``
No
!
the
proper
thing
was
to
face
it
out
--
alone
*NL*
for
myself
--
wait
for
another
chance

find
out

CHAPTER
12
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
around
everything
was
still
as
far
as
the
ear
could
reach
.
The
mist
*NL*
of
his
feelings
shifted
between
us
,
as
if
disturbed
by
his
struggles
,
*NL*
and
in
the
rifts
of
the
immaterial
veil
he
would
appear
to
my
staring
*NL*
eyes
distinct
of
form
and
pregnant
with
vague
appeal
like
a
symbolic
*NL*
figure
in
a
picture
.
The
chill
air
of
the
night
seemed
to
lie
on
my
*NL*
limbs
as
heavy
as
a
slab
of
marble
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
see
,
''
I
murmured
,
more
to
prove
to
myself
that
I
could
break
my
*NL*
state
of
numbness
than
for
any
other
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
The
Avondale
picked
us
up
just
before
sunset
,
''
he
remarked
moodily
.
*NL*
``
Steamed
right
straight
for
us
.
We
had
only
to
sit
and
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
a
long
interval
,
he
said
,
``
They
told
their
story
.
''
And
again
*NL*
there
was
that
oppressive
silence
.
``
Then
only
I
knew
what
it
was
I
had
*NL*
made
up
my
mind
to
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
said
nothing
,
''
I
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
could
I
say
?
''
he
asked
,
in
the
same
low
tone
...
``
Shock
*NL*
slight
.
Stopped
the
ship
.
Ascertained
the
damage
.
Took
measures
to
get
*NL*
the
boats
out
without
creating
a
panic
.
As
the
first
boat
was
lowered
*NL*
ship
went
down
in
a
squall
.
Sank
like
lead
...
What
could
be
more
*NL*
clear
''
...
he
hung
his
head
...
``
and
more
awful
?
''
His
lips
quivered
*NL*
while
he
looked
straight
into
my
eyes
.
``
I
had
jumped
--
had
n't
I
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
,
dismayed
.
``
That
's
what
I
had
to
live
down
.
The
story
did
n't
*NL*
matter
.
''
...
He
clasped
his
hands
for
an
instant
,
glanced
right
and
*NL*
left
into
the
gloom
:
``
It
was
like
cheating
the
dead
,
''
he
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
there
were
no
dead
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
went
away
from
me
at
this
.
That
is
the
only
way
I
can
describe
it
.
*NL*
In
a
moment
I
saw
his
back
close
to
the
balustrade
.
He
stood
there
for
*NL*
some
time
,
as
if
admiring
the
purity
and
the
peace
of
the
night
.
Some
*NL*
flowering-shrub
in
the
garden
below
spread
its
powerful
scent
through
*NL*
the
damp
air
.
He
returned
to
me
with
hasty
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
that
did
not
matter
,
''
he
said
,
as
stubbornly
as
you
please
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Perhaps
not
,
''
I
admitted
.
I
began
to
have
a
notion
he
was
too
much
for
*NL*
me
.
After
all
,
what
did
_
I
_
know
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Dead
or
not
dead
,
I
could
not
get
clear
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
had
to
live
;
*NL*
had
n't
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Well
,
yes
--
if
you
take
it
in
that
way
,
''
I
mumbled
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
was
glad
,
of
course
,
''
he
threw
out
carelessly
,
with
his
mind
fixed
*NL*
on
something
else
.
``
The
exposure
,
''
he
pronounced
slowly
,
and
lifted
*NL*
his
head
.
``
Do
you
know
what
was
my
first
thought
when
I
heard
?
I
was
*NL*
relieved
.
I
was
relieved
to
learn
that
those
shouts
--
did
I
tell
you
I
*NL*
had
heard
shouts
?
No
?
Well
,
I
did
.
Shouts
for
help
...
blown
along
*NL*
with
the
drizzle
.
Imagination
,
I
suppose
.
And
yet
I
can
hardly
...
How
*NL*
stupid
...
The
others
did
not
.
I
asked
them
afterwards
.
They
all
*NL*
said
No
.
No
?
And
I
was
hearing
them
even
then
!
I
might
have
known
--
but
*NL*
I
did
n't
think
--
I
only
listened
.
Very
faint
screams
--
day
after
day
.
Then
*NL*
that
little
half-caste
chap
here
came
up
and
spoke
to
me
.
`
The
*NL*
Patna
...
French
gunboat
...
towed
successfully
to
Aden
...
*NL*
Investigation
...
Marine
Office
...
Sailors
'
Home
...
arrangements
*NL*
made
for
your
board
and
lodging
!
'
I
walked
along
with
him
,
and
I
enjoyed
*NL*
the
silence
.
So
there
had
been
no
shouting
.
Imagination
.
I
had
to
*NL*
believe
him
.
I
could
hear
nothing
any
more
.
I
wonder
how
long
I
could
*NL*
have
stood
it
.
It
was
getting
worse
,
too
...
I
mean
--
louder
.
''
`
He
fell
*NL*
into
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
I
had
heard
nothing
!
Well
--
so
be
it
.
But
the
lights
!
The
lights
*NL*
did
go
!
We
did
not
see
them
.
They
were
not
there
.
If
they
had
been
,
I
*NL*
would
have
swam
back
--
I
would
have
gone
back
and
shouted
alongside
--
I
*NL*
would
have
begged
them
to
take
me
on
board
...
I
would
have
had
my
*NL*
chance
...
You
doubt
me
?
...
How
do
you
know
how
I
felt
?
...
What
*NL*
right
have
you
to
doubt
?
...
I
very
nearly
did
it
as
it
was
--
do
you
*NL*
understand
?
''
His
voice
fell
.
``
There
was
not
a
glimmer
--
not
a
glimmer
,
''
*NL*
he
protested
mournfully
.
``
Do
n't
you
understand
that
if
there
had
been
,
*NL*
you
would
not
have
seen
me
here
?
You
see
me
--
and
you
doubt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
shook
my
head
negatively
.
This
question
of
the
lights
being
lost
*NL*
sight
of
when
the
boat
could
not
have
been
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
*NL*
from
the
ship
was
a
matter
for
much
discussion
.
Jim
stuck
to
it
that
*NL*
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
after
the
first
shower
had
cleared
away
;
*NL*
and
the
others
had
affirmed
the
same
thing
to
the
officers
of
the
*NL*
Avondale
.
Of
course
people
shook
their
heads
and
smiled
.
One
old
skipper
*NL*
who
sat
near
me
in
court
tickled
my
ear
with
his
white
beard
to
murmur
,
*NL*
``
Of
course
they
would
lie
.
''
As
a
matter
of
fact
nobody
lied
;
not
even
*NL*
the
chief
engineer
with
his
story
of
the
mast-head
light
dropping
like
a
*NL*
match
you
throw
down
.
Not
consciously
,
at
least
.
A
man
with
his
liver
in
*NL*
such
a
state
might
very
well
have
seen
a
floating
spark
in
the
corner
of
*NL*
his
eye
when
stealing
a
hurried
glance
over
his
shoulder
.
They
had
seen
*NL*
no
light
of
any
sort
though
they
were
well
within
range
,
and
they
could
*NL*
only
explain
this
in
one
way
:
the
ship
had
gone
down
.
It
was
obvious
*NL*
and
comforting
.
The
foreseen
fact
coming
so
swiftly
had
justified
their
*NL*
haste
.
No
wonder
they
did
not
cast
about
for
any
other
explanation
.
Yet
*NL*
the
true
one
was
very
simple
,
and
as
soon
as
Brierly
suggested
it
the
*NL*
court
ceased
to
bother
about
the
question
.
If
you
remember
,
the
ship
had
*NL*
been
stopped
,
and
was
lying
with
her
head
on
the
course
steered
through
*NL*
the
night
,
with
her
stern
canted
high
and
her
bows
brought
low
down
in
*NL*
the
water
through
the
filling
of
the
fore-compartment
.
Being
thus
out
of
*NL*
trim
,
when
the
squall
struck
her
a
little
on
the
quarter
,
she
swung
head
*NL*
to
wind
as
sharply
as
though
she
had
been
at
anchor
.
By
this
change
in
*NL*
her
position
all
her
lights
were
in
a
very
few
moments
shut
off
from
*NL*
the
boat
to
leeward
.
It
may
very
well
be
that
,
had
they
been
seen
,
they
*NL*
would
have
had
the
effect
of
a
mute
appeal
--
that
their
glimmer
lost
in
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
cloud
would
have
had
the
mysterious
power
of
the
*NL*
human
glance
that
can
awaken
the
feelings
of
remorse
and
pity
.
It
would
*NL*
have
said
,
``
I
am
here
--
still
here
''
...
and
what
more
can
the
eye
of
*NL*
the
most
forsaken
of
human
beings
say
?
But
she
turned
her
back
on
them
*NL*
as
if
in
disdain
of
their
fate
:
she
had
swung
round
,
burdened
,
to
glare
*NL*
stubbornly
at
the
new
danger
of
the
open
sea
which
she
so
strangely
*NL*
survived
to
end
her
days
in
a
breaking-up
yard
,
as
if
it
had
been
her
*NL*
recorded
fate
to
die
obscurely
under
the
blows
of
many
hammers
.
What
*NL*
were
the
various
ends
their
destiny
provided
for
the
pilgrims
I
am
*NL*
unable
to
say
;
but
the
immediate
future
brought
,
at
about
nine
o'clock
*NL*
next
morning
,
a
French
gunboat
homeward
bound
from
Reunion
.
The
report
*NL*
of
her
commander
was
public
property
.
He
had
swept
a
little
out
of
*NL*
his
course
to
ascertain
what
was
the
matter
with
that
steamer
floating
*NL*
dangerously
by
the
head
upon
a
still
and
hazy
sea
.
There
was
an
ensign
,
*NL*
union
down
,
flying
at
her
main
gaff
-LRB-
the
serang
had
the
sense
to
make
a
*NL*
signal
of
distress
at
daylight
-RRB-
;
but
the
cooks
were
preparing
the
food
*NL*
in
the
cooking-boxes
forward
as
usual
.
The
decks
were
packed
as
close
*NL*
as
a
sheep-pen
:
there
were
people
perched
all
along
the
rails
,
jammed
on
*NL*
the
bridge
in
a
solid
mass
;
hundreds
of
eyes
stared
,
and
not
a
sound
was
*NL*
heard
when
the
gunboat
ranged
abreast
,
as
if
all
that
multitude
of
lips
*NL*
had
been
sealed
by
a
spell
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Frenchman
hailed
,
could
get
no
intelligible
reply
,
and
after
*NL*
ascertaining
through
his
binoculars
that
the
crowd
on
deck
did
not
look
*NL*
plague-stricken
,
decided
to
send
a
boat
.
Two
officers
came
on
board
,
*NL*
listened
to
the
serang
,
tried
to
talk
with
the
Arab
,
could
n't
make
head
*NL*
or
tail
of
it
:
but
of
course
the
nature
of
the
emergency
was
obvious
*NL*
enough
.
They
were
also
very
much
struck
by
discovering
a
white
man
,
dead
*NL*
and
curled
up
peacefully
on
the
bridge
.
``
Fort
intrigues
par
ce
cadavre
,
''
*NL*
as
I
was
informed
a
long
time
after
by
an
elderly
French
lieutenant
whom
*NL*
I
came
across
one
afternoon
in
Sydney
,
by
the
merest
chance
,
in
a
sort
*NL*
of
cafe
,
and
who
remembered
the
affair
perfectly
.
Indeed
this
affair
,
*NL*
I
may
notice
in
passing
,
had
an
extraordinary
power
of
defying
the
*NL*
shortness
of
memories
and
the
length
of
time
:
it
seemed
to
live
,
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
uncanny
vitality
,
in
the
minds
of
men
,
on
the
tips
of
their
*NL*
tongues
.
I
've
had
the
questionable
pleasure
of
meeting
it
often
,
years
*NL*
afterwards
,
thousands
of
miles
away
,
emerging
from
the
remotest
possible
*NL*
talk
,
coming
to
the
surface
of
the
most
distant
allusions
.
Has
it
not
*NL*
turned
up
to-night
between
us
?
And
I
am
the
only
seaman
here
.
I
am
the
*NL*
only
one
to
whom
it
is
a
memory
.
And
yet
it
has
made
its
way
out
!
But
if
*NL*
two
men
who
,
unknown
to
each
other
,
knew
of
this
affair
met
accidentally
*NL*
on
any
spot
of
this
earth
,
the
thing
would
pop
up
between
them
as
sure
*NL*
as
fate
,
before
they
parted
.
I
had
never
seen
that
Frenchman
before
,
and
*NL*
at
the
end
of
an
hour
we
had
done
with
each
other
for
life
:
he
did
not
*NL*
seem
particularly
talkative
either
;
he
was
a
quiet
,
massive
chap
in
a
*NL*
creased
uniform
,
sitting
drowsily
over
a
tumbler
half
full
of
some
*NL*
dark
liquid
.
His
shoulder-straps
were
a
bit
tarnished
,
his
clean-shaved
*NL*
cheeks
were
large
and
sallow
;
he
looked
like
a
man
who
would
be
given
*NL*
to
taking
snuff
--
do
n't
you
know
?
I
wo
n't
say
he
did
;
but
the
habit
would
*NL*
have
fitted
that
kind
of
man
.
It
all
began
by
his
handing
me
a
number
of
*NL*
Home
News
,
which
I
did
n't
want
,
across
the
marble
table
.
I
said
``
Merci
.
''
*NL*
We
exchanged
a
few
apparently
innocent
remarks
,
and
suddenly
,
before
*NL*
I
knew
how
it
had
come
about
,
we
were
in
the
midst
of
it
,
and
he
was
*NL*
telling
me
how
much
they
had
been
``
intrigued
by
that
corpse
.
''
It
turned
*NL*
out
he
had
been
one
of
the
boarding
officers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
the
establishment
where
we
sat
one
could
get
a
variety
of
foreign
*NL*
drinks
which
were
kept
for
the
visiting
naval
officers
,
and
he
took
a
*NL*
sip
of
the
dark
medical-looking
stuff
,
which
probably
was
nothing
more
*NL*
nasty
than
cassis
a
l'eau
,
and
glancing
with
one
eye
into
the
tumbler
,
*NL*
shook
his
head
slightly
.
``
Impossible
de
comprendre
--
vous
concevez
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
with
a
curious
mixture
of
unconcern
and
thoughtfulness
.
I
could
*NL*
very
easily
conceive
how
impossible
it
had
been
for
them
to
understand
.
*NL*
Nobody
in
the
gunboat
knew
enough
English
to
get
hold
of
the
story
as
*NL*
told
by
the
serang
.
There
was
a
good
deal
of
noise
,
too
,
round
the
two
*NL*
officers
.
``
They
crowded
upon
us
.
There
was
a
circle
round
that
dead
*NL*
man
-LRB-
autour
de
ce
mort
-RRB-
,
''
he
described
.
``
One
had
to
attend
to
the
most
*NL*
pressing
.
These
people
were
beginning
to
agitate
themselves
--
Parbleu
!
*NL*
A
mob
like
that
--
do
n't
you
see
?
''
he
interjected
with
philosophic
*NL*
indulgence
.
As
to
the
bulkhead
,
he
had
advised
his
commander
that
the
*NL*
safest
thing
was
to
leave
it
alone
,
it
was
so
villainous
to
look
at
.
*NL*
They
got
two
hawsers
on
board
promptly
-LRB-
en
toute
hale
-RRB-
and
took
the
*NL*
Patna
in
tow
--
stern
foremost
at
that
--
which
,
under
the
circumstances
,
*NL*
was
not
so
foolish
,
since
the
rudder
was
too
much
out
of
the
water
to
*NL*
be
of
any
great
use
for
steering
,
and
this
manoeuvre
eased
the
strain
on
*NL*
the
bulkhead
,
whose
state
,
he
expounded
with
stolid
glibness
,
demanded
*NL*
the
greatest
care
-LRB-
exigeait
les
plus
grands
menagements
-RRB-
.
I
could
not
*NL*
help
thinking
that
my
new
acquaintance
must
have
had
a
voice
in
most
of
*NL*
these
arrangements
:
he
looked
a
reliable
officer
,
no
longer
very
active
,
*NL*
and
he
was
seamanlike
too
,
in
a
way
,
though
as
he
sat
there
,
with
his
*NL*
thick
fingers
clasped
lightly
on
his
stomach
,
he
reminded
you
of
one
*NL*
of
those
snuffy
,
quiet
village
priests
,
into
whose
ears
are
poured
the
*NL*
sins
,
the
sufferings
,
the
remorse
of
peasant
generations
,
on
whose
faces
*NL*
the
placid
and
simple
expression
is
like
a
veil
thrown
over
the
mystery
*NL*
of
pain
and
distress
.
He
ought
to
have
had
a
threadbare
black
soutane
*NL*
buttoned
smoothly
up
to
his
ample
chin
,
instead
of
a
frock-coat
with
*NL*
shoulder-straps
and
brass
buttons
.
His
broad
bosom
heaved
regularly
*NL*
while
he
went
on
telling
me
that
it
had
been
the
very
devil
of
a
job
,
*NL*
as
doubtless
-LRB-
sans
doute
-RRB-
I
could
figure
to
myself
in
my
quality
of
a
*NL*
seaman
-LRB-
en
votre
qualite
de
marin
-RRB-
.
At
the
end
of
the
period
he
inclined
*NL*
his
body
slightly
towards
me
,
and
,
pursing
his
shaved
lips
,
allowed
the
*NL*
air
to
escape
with
a
gentle
hiss
.
``
Luckily
,
''
he
continued
,
``
the
sea
was
*NL*
level
like
this
table
,
and
there
was
no
more
wind
than
there
is
here
.
''
*NL*
...
The
place
struck
me
as
indeed
intolerably
stuffy
,
and
very
hot
;
*NL*
my
face
burned
as
though
I
had
been
young
enough
to
be
embarrassed
and
*NL*
blushing
.
They
had
directed
their
course
,
he
pursued
,
to
the
nearest
*NL*
English
port
``
naturellement
,
''
where
their
responsibility
ceased
,
``
Dieu
*NL*
merci
.
''
...
He
blew
out
his
flat
cheeks
a
little
...
``
Because
,
*NL*
mind
you
-LRB-
notez
bien
-RRB-
,
all
the
time
of
towing
we
had
two
quartermasters
*NL*
stationed
with
axes
by
the
hawsers
,
to
cut
us
clear
of
our
tow
in
case
*NL*
she
...
''
He
fluttered
downwards
his
heavy
eyelids
,
making
his
meaning
*NL*
as
plain
as
possible
...
``
What
would
you
!
One
does
what
one
can
*NL*
-LRB-
on
fait
ce
qu'on
peut
-RRB-
,
''
and
for
a
moment
he
managed
to
invest
*NL*
his
ponderous
immobility
with
an
air
of
resignation
.
``
Two
*NL*
quartermasters
--
thirty
hours
--
always
there
.
Two
!
''
he
repeated
,
lifting
*NL*
up
his
right
hand
a
little
,
and
exhibiting
two
fingers
.
This
was
*NL*
absolutely
the
first
gesture
I
saw
him
make
.
It
gave
me
the
opportunity
*NL*
to
``
note
''
a
starred
scar
on
the
back
of
his
hand
--
effect
of
a
gunshot
*NL*
clearly
;
and
,
as
if
my
sight
had
been
made
more
acute
by
this
discovery
,
*NL*
I
perceived
also
the
seam
of
an
old
wound
,
beginning
a
little
below
the
*NL*
temple
and
going
out
of
sight
under
the
short
grey
hair
at
the
side
of
*NL*
his
head
--
the
graze
of
a
spear
or
the
cut
of
a
sabre
.
He
clasped
his
*NL*
hands
on
his
stomach
again
.
``
I
remained
on
board
that
--
that
--
my
memory
*NL*
is
going
-LRB-
s
`
en
va

.
Ah
!
Patt-na
.
C'est

Patt-na

.
It
is
*NL*
droll
how
one
forgets
.
I
stayed
on
that
ship
thirty
hours
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
did
!
''
I
exclaimed
.
Still
gazing
at
his
hands
,
he
pursed
his
lips
a
*NL*
little
,
but
this
time
made
no
hissing
sound
.
``
It
was
judged
proper
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
lifting
his
eyebrows
dispassionately
,
``
that
one
of
the
officers
*NL*
should
remain
to
keep
an
eye
open
-LRB-
pour
ouvrir

''
...
he
sighed
*NL*
idly
...
``
and
for
communicating
by
signals
with
the
towing
ship
--
do
*NL*
you
see
?
--
and
so
on
.
For
the
rest
,
it
was
my
opinion
too
.
We
made
our
*NL*
boats
ready
to
drop
over
--
and
I
also
on
that
ship
took
measures
...
*NL*
Enfin
!
One
has
done
one
's
possible
.
It
was
a
delicate
position
.
Thirty
*NL*
hours
!
They
prepared
me
some
food
.
As
for
the
wine
--
go
and
whistle
for
*NL*
it
--
not
a
drop
.
''
In
some
extraordinary
way
,
without
any
marked
change
in
*NL*
his
inert
attitude
and
in
the
placid
expression
of
his
face
,
he
managed
*NL*
to
convey
the
idea
of
profound
disgust
.
``
I
--
you
know
--
when
it
comes
to
*NL*
eating
without
my
glass
of
wine
--
I
am
nowhere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
afraid
he
would
enlarge
upon
the
grievance
,
for
though
he
did
n't
*NL*
stir
a
limb
or
twitch
a
feature
,
he
made
one
aware
how
much
he
was
*NL*
irritated
by
the
recollection
.
But
he
seemed
to
forget
all
about
it
.
*NL*
They
delivered
their
charge
to
the
``
port
authorities
,
''
as
he
expressed
*NL*
it
.
He
was
struck
by
the
calmness
with
which
it
had
been
received
.
``
One
*NL*
might
have
thought
they
had
such
a
droll

-LRB-
drole
de

-RRB-
*NL*
brought
them
every
day
.
You
are
extraordinary
--
you
others
,
''
he
*NL*
commented
,
with
his
back
propped
against
the
wall
,
and
looking
himself
*NL*
as
incapable
of
an
emotional
display
as
a
sack
of
meal
.
There
happened
*NL*
to
be
a
man-of-war
and
an
Indian
Marine
steamer
in
the
harbour
at
the
*NL*
time
,
and
he
did
not
conceal
his
admiration
of
the
efficient
manner
in
*NL*
which
the
boats
of
these
two
ships
cleared
the
Patna
of
her
passengers
.
*NL*
Indeed
his
torpid
demeanour
concealed
nothing
:
it
had
that
mysterious
,
*NL*
almost
miraculous
,
power
of
producing
striking
effects
by
means
*NL*
impossible
of
detection
which
is
the
last
word
of
the
highest
art
.
*NL*
``
Twenty-five
minutes
--
watch
in
hand
--
twenty-five
,
no
more
.
''
...
He
*NL*
unclasped
and
clasped
again
his
fingers
without
removing
his
hands
from
*NL*
his
stomach
,
and
made
it
infinitely
more
effective
than
if
he
had
thrown
*NL*
up
his
arms
to
heaven
in
amazement
...
``

With
downcast
eyes
and
his
head

tilted
slightly
on
one
side
he
seemed
to
roll
knowingly
on
his
tongue
*NL*
the
savour
of
a
smart
bit
of
work

He
persuaded
one
without
any
further

demonstration
that
his
approval
was
eminently
worth
having
,
and
resuming

his
hardly

CHAPTER
13
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
these
words
,
and
without
a
change
of
attitude
,
he
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
submitted
himself
passively
to
a
state
of
silence
.
I
kept
him
company
;
*NL*
and
suddenly
,
but
not
abruptly
,
as
if
the
appointed
time
had
arrived
*NL*
for
his
moderate
and
husky
voice
to
come
out
of
his
immobility
,
he
*NL*
pronounced
,
``
Mon
Dieu
!
how
the
time
passes
!
''
Nothing
could
have
been
*NL*
more
commonplace
than
this
remark
;
but
its
utterance
coincided
for
me
*NL*
with
a
moment
of
vision
.
It
's
extraordinary
how
we
go
through
life
with
*NL*
eyes
half
shut
,
with
dull
ears
,
with
dormant
thoughts
.
Perhaps
it
's
just
*NL*
as
well
;
and
it
may
be
that
it
is
this
very
dullness
that
makes
life
to
*NL*
the
incalculable
majority
so
supportable
and
so
welcome
.
Nevertheless
,
*NL*
there
can
be
but
few
of
us
who
had
never
known
one
of
these
rare
moments
*NL*
of
awakening
when
we
see
,
hear
,
understand
ever
so
much
--
everything
--
in
*NL*
a
flash
--
before
we
fall
back
again
into
our
agreeable
somnolence
.
I
*NL*
raised
my
eyes
when
he
spoke
,
and
I
saw
him
as
though
I
had
never
seen
*NL*
him
before
.
I
saw
his
chin
sunk
on
his
breast
,
the
clumsy
folds
of
his
*NL*
coat
,
his
clasped
hands
,
his
motionless
pose
,
so
curiously
suggestive
*NL*
of
his
having
been
simply
left
there
.
Time
had
passed
indeed
:
it
had
*NL*
overtaken
him
and
gone
ahead
.
It
had
left
him
hopelessly
behind
with
*NL*
a
few
poor
gifts
:
the
iron-grey
hair
,
the
heavy
fatigue
of
the
tanned
*NL*
face
,
two
scars
,
a
pair
of
tarnished
shoulder-straps
;
one
of
those
*NL*
steady
,
reliable
men
who
are
the
raw
material
of
great
reputations
,
*NL*
one
of
those
uncounted
lives
that
are
buried
without
drums
and
*NL*
trumpets
under
the
foundations
of
monumental
successes
.
``
I
am
now
third
*NL*
lieutenant
of
the
Victorieuse
''
-LRB-
she
was
the
flagship
of
the
French
*NL*
Pacific
squadron
at
the
time
-RRB-
,
he
said
,
detaching
his
shoulders
from
*NL*
the
wall
a
couple
of
inches
to
introduce
himself
.
I
bowed
slightly
on
my
*NL*
side
of
the
table
,
and
told
him
I
commanded
a
merchant
vessel
at
present
*NL*
anchored
in
Rushcutters
'
Bay
.
He
had
``
remarked
''
her
,
--
a
pretty
little
*NL*
craft
.
He
was
very
civil
about
it
in
his
impassive
way
.
I
even
fancy
*NL*
he
went
the
length
of
tilting
his
head
in
compliment
as
he
repeated
,
*NL*
breathing
visibly
the
while
,
``
Ah
,
yes
.
A
little
craft
painted
*NL*
black
--
very
pretty
--
very
pretty
-LRB-
tres
coquet
-RRB-
.
''
After
a
time
he
twisted
*NL*
his
body
slowly
to
face
the
glass
door
on
our
right
.
``
A
dull
town
*NL*
-LRB-
triste
ville
-RRB-
,
''
he
observed
,
staring
into
the
street
.
It
was
a
*NL*
brilliant
day
;
a
southerly
buster
was
raging
,
and
we
could
see
the
*NL*
passers-by
,
men
and
women
,
buffeted
by
the
wind
on
the
sidewalks
,
the
*NL*
sunlit
fronts
of
the
houses
across
the
road
blurred
by
the
tall
whirls
*NL*
of
dust
.
``
I
descended
on
shore
,
''
he
said
,
``
to
stretch
my
legs
a
little
,
*NL*
but
...
''
He
did
n't
finish
,
and
sank
into
the
depths
of
his
repose
.
*NL*
``
Pray
--
tell
me
,
''
he
began
,
coming
up
ponderously
,
``
what
was
there
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
this
affair
--
precisely
-LRB-
au
juste
-RRB-
?
It
is
curious
.
That
dead
*NL*
man
,
for
instance
--
and
so
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
There
were
living
men
too
,
''
I
said
;
``
much
more
curious
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
No
doubt
,
no
doubt
,
''
he
agreed
half
audibly
,
then
,
as
if
after
*NL*
mature
consideration
,
murmured
,
``
Evidently
.
''
I
made
no
difficulty
in
*NL*
communicating
to
him
what
had
interested
me
most
in
this
affair
.
It
*NL*
seemed
as
though
he
had
a
right
to
know
:
had
n't
he
spent
thirty
hours
*NL*
on
board
the
Patna
--
had
he
not
taken
the
succession
,
so
to
speak
,
had
*NL*
he
not
done
``
his
possible
''
?
He
listened
to
me
,
looking
more
priest-like
*NL*
than
ever
,
and
with
what
--
probably
on
account
of
his
downcast
eyes
--
had
*NL*
the
appearance
of
devout
concentration
.
Once
or
twice
he
elevated
*NL*
his
eyebrows
-LRB-
but
without
raising
his
eyelids
-RRB-
,
as
one
would
say
``
The
*NL*
devil
!
''
Once
he
calmly
exclaimed
,
``
Ah
,
bah
!
''
under
his
breath
,
and
when
*NL*
I
had
finished
he
pursed
his
lips
in
a
deliberate
way
and
emitted
a
sort
*NL*
of
sorrowful
whistle
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
any
one
else
it
might
have
been
an
evidence
of
boredom
,
a
sign
of
*NL*
indifference
;
but
he
,
in
his
occult
way
,
managed
to
make
his
immobility
*NL*
appear
profoundly
responsive
,
and
as
full
of
valuable
thoughts
as
an
*NL*
egg
is
of
meat
.
What
he
said
at
last
was
nothing
more
than
a
``
Very
*NL*
interesting
,
''
pronounced
politely
,
and
not
much
above
a
whisper
.
Before
*NL*
I
got
over
my
disappointment
he
added
,
but
as
if
speaking
to
himself
,
*NL*
``
That
's
it
.
That
_
is
_
it
.
''
His
chin
seemed
to
sink
lower
on
his
breast
,
*NL*
his
body
to
weigh
heavier
on
his
seat
.
I
was
about
to
ask
him
what
he
*NL*
meant
,
when
a
sort
of
preparatory
tremor
passed
over
his
whole
person
,
*NL*
as
a
faint
ripple
may
be
seen
upon
stagnant
water
even
before
the
wind
*NL*
is
felt
.
``
And
so
that
poor
young
man
ran
away
along
with
the
others
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
with
grave
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
what
made
me
smile
:
it
is
the
only
genuine
smile
of
mine
*NL*
I
can
remember
in
connection
with
Jim
's
affair
.
But
somehow
this
simple
*NL*
statement
of
the
matter
sounded
funny
in
French
...
``
S'est
enfui
avec
*NL*
les
autres
,
''
had
said
the
lieutenant
.
And
suddenly
I
began
to
admire
the
*NL*
discrimination
of
the
man
.
He
had
made
out
the
point
at
once
:
he
did
*NL*
get
hold
of
the
only
thing
I
cared
about
.
I
felt
as
though
I
were
taking
*NL*
professional
opinion
on
the
case
.
His
imperturbable
and
mature
calmness
*NL*
was
that
of
an
expert
in
possession
of
the
facts
,
and
to
whom
one
's
*NL*
perplexities
are
mere
child
's
-
play
.
``
Ah
!
The
young
,
the
young
,
''
he
said
*NL*
indulgently
.
``
And
after
all
,
one
does
not
die
of
it
.
''
``
Die
of
what
?
''
I
*NL*
asked
swiftly
.
``
Of
being
afraid
.
''
He
elucidated
his
meaning
and
sipped
*NL*
his
drink
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
perceived
that
the
three
last
fingers
of
his
wounded
hand
were
stiff
*NL*
and
could
not
move
independently
of
each
other
,
so
that
he
took
up
his
*NL*
tumbler
with
an
ungainly
clutch
.
``
One
is
always
afraid
.
One
may
talk
,
*NL*
but
...
''
He
put
down
the
glass
awkwardly
...
``
The
fear
,
the
*NL*
fear
--
look
you
--
it
is
always
there
.
''
...
He
touched
his
breast
near
*NL*
a
brass
button
,
on
the
very
spot
where
Jim
had
given
a
thump
to
his
*NL*
own
when
protesting
that
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
his
heart
.
I
*NL*
suppose
I
made
some
sign
of
dissent
,
because
he
insisted
,
``
Yes
!
yes
!
One
*NL*
talks
,
one
talks
;
this
is
all
very
fine
;
but
at
the
end
of
the
reckoning
*NL*
one
is
no
cleverer
than
the
next
man
--
and
no
more
brave
.
Brave
!
This
*NL*
is
always
to
be
seen
.
I
have
rolled
my
hump
-LRB-
roule
ma
bosse
-RRB-
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
using
the
slang
expression
with
imperturbable
seriousness
,
``
in
all
parts
*NL*
of
the
world
;
I
have
known
brave
men
--
famous
ones
!
Allez
!
''
...
He
*NL*
drank
carelessly
...
``
Brave
--
you
conceive
--
in
the
Service
--
one
has
*NL*
got
to
be
--
the
trade
demands
it
-LRB-
le
metier
veut
ca
-RRB-
.
Is
it
not
so
?
''
he
*NL*
appealed
to
me
reasonably
.
``
Eh
bien
!
Each
of
them
--
I
say
each
of
them
,
*NL*
if
he
were
an
honest
man
--
bien
entendu
--
would
confess
that
there
is
a
*NL*
point
--
there
is
a
point
--
for
the
best
of
us
--
there
is
somewhere
a
point
*NL*
when
you
let
go
everything
-LRB-
vous
lachez
tout
-RRB-
.
And
you
have
got
to
*NL*
live
with
that
truth
--
do
you
see
?
Given
a
certain
combination
*NL*
of
circumstances
,
fear
is
sure
to
come
.
Abominable
funk
-LRB-
un
trac
*NL*
epouvantable
-RRB-
.
And
even
for
those
who
do
not
believe
this
truth
there
is
*NL*
fear
all
the
same
--
the
fear
of
themselves
.
Absolutely
so
.
Trust
me
.
Yes
.
*NL*
Yes
...
At
my
age
one
knows
what
one
is
talking
about
--
que
diable
!
''
*NL*
...
He
had
delivered
himself
of
all
this
as
immovably
as
though
he
had
*NL*
been
the
mouthpiece
of
abstract
wisdom
,
but
at
this
point
he
heightened
*NL*
the
effect
of
detachment
by
beginning
to
twirl
his
thumbs
slowly
.
``
It
's
*NL*
evident
--
parbleu
!
''
he
continued
;
``
for
,
make
up
your
mind
as
much
as
you
*NL*
like
,
even
a
simple
headache
or
a
fit
of
indigestion
-LRB-
un
derangement
*NL*
d'estomac
-RRB-
is
enough
to
...
Take
me
,
for
instance
--
I
have
made
my
*NL*
proofs
.
Eh
bien
!
I
,
who
am
speaking
to
you
,
once
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
drained
his
glass
and
returned
to
his
twirling
.
``
No
,
no
;
one
does
*NL*
not
die
of
it
,
''
he
pronounced
finally
,
and
when
I
found
he
did
not
mean
*NL*
to
proceed
with
the
personal
anecdote
,
I
was
extremely
disappointed
;
the
*NL*
more
so
as
it
was
not
the
sort
of
story
,
you
know
,
one
could
very
well
*NL*
press
him
for
.
I
sat
silent
,
and
he
too
,
as
if
nothing
could
please
him
*NL*
better
.
Even
his
thumbs
were
still
now
.
Suddenly
his
lips
began
to
move
.
*NL*
``
That
is
so
,
''
he
resumed
placidly
.
``
Man
is
born
a
coward
-LRB-
L'homme
est
ne
*NL*
poltron
-RRB-
.
It
is
a
difficulty

parbleu
!
It
would
be
too
easy

But

habit

necessity

do
you
see
?

the
eye
of
others

One
*NL*
puts
up
with
it
.
And
then
the
example
of
others
who
are
no
better
than
*NL*
yourself
,
and
yet
make
good
countenance
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
voice
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
That
young
man
--
you
will
observe
--
had
none
of
these
inducements
--
at
*NL*
least
at
the
moment
,
''
I
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
raised
his
eyebrows
forgivingly
:
``
I
do
n't
say
;
I
do
n't
say
.
The
*NL*
young
man
in
question
might
have
had
the
best
dispositions
--
the
best
*NL*
dispositions

he
repeated
,
wheezing
a
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
am
glad
to
see
you
taking
a
lenient
view
,
''
I
said
.
``
His
own
feeling
*NL*
in
the
matter
was
--
ah
!
--
hopeful
,
and
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
shuffle
of
his
feet
under
the
table
interrupted
me
.
He
drew
up
*NL*
his
heavy
eyelids
.
Drew
up
,
I
say
--
no
other
expression
can
describe
the
*NL*
steady
deliberation
of
the
act
--
and
at
last
was
disclosed
completely
to
*NL*
me
.
I
was
confronted
by
two
narrow
grey
circlets
,
like
two
tiny
steel
*NL*
rings
around
the
profound
blackness
of
the
pupils
.
The
sharp
glance
,
*NL*
coming
from
that
massive
body
,
gave
a
notion
of
extreme
efficiency
,
like
*NL*
a
razor-edge
on
a
battle-axe
.
``
Pardon
,
''
he
said
punctiliously
.
His
right
*NL*
hand
went
up
,
and
he
swayed
forward
.
``
Allow
me
...
I
contended
that
*NL*
one
may
get
on
knowing
very
well
that
one
's
courage
does
not
come
of
*NL*
itself
-LRB-
ne
vient
pas

seul
-RRB-

There
's
nothing
much
in
that
to
*NL*
get
upset
about

One
truth
the
more
ought
not
to
make
life
*NL*
impossible

But
the
honour

the
honour

...
The
honour
*NL*
...
that
is
real
--
that
is
!
And
what
life
may
be
worth
when

...
he
*NL*
got
on
his
feet
with
a
ponderous
impetuosity
,
as
a
startled
ox
might
*NL*
scramble
up
from
the
grass
...
``
when
the
honour
is
gone

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
risen
too
,
and
,
trying
to
throw
infinite
politeness
into
*NL*
our
attitudes
,
we
faced
each
other
mutely
,
like
two
china
dogs
on
a
*NL*
mantelpiece
.
Hang
the
fellow
!
he
had
pricked
the
bubble
.
The
blight
*NL*
of
futility
that
lies
in
wait
for
men
's
speeches
had
fallen
upon
our
*NL*
conversation
,
and
made
it
a
thing
of
empty
sounds
.
``
Very
well
,
''
I
said
,
*NL*
with
a
disconcerted
smile
;
``
but
could
n't
it
reduce
itself
to
not
being
*NL*
found
out
?
''
He
made
as
if
to
retort
readily
,
but
when
he
spoke
he
had
*NL*
changed
his
mind
.
``
This
,
monsieur
,
is
too
fine
for
me
--
much
above
me
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
think
about
it
.
''
He
bowed
heavily
over
his
cap
,
which
he
held
*NL*
before
him
by
the
peak
,
between
the
thumb
and
the
forefinger
of
his
*NL*
wounded
hand
.
I
bowed
too
.
We
bowed
together
:
we
scraped
our
feet
at
*NL*
each
other
with
much
ceremony
,
while
a
dirty
specimen
of
a
waiter
looked
*NL*
on
critically
,
as
though
he
had
paid
for
the
performance
.
``
Serviteur
,
''
*NL*
said
the
Frenchman
.
Another
scrape
.
``
Monsieur
''
...
``
Monsieur
.
''
...
*NL*
The
glass
door
swung
behind
his
burly
back
.
I
saw
the
southerly
buster
*NL*
get
hold
of
him
and
drive
him
down
wind
with
his
hand
to
his
head
,
his
*NL*
shoulders
braced
,
and
the
tails
of
his
coat
blown
hard
against
his
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sat
down
again
alone
and
discouraged
--
discouraged
about
Jim
's
case
.
*NL*
If
you
wonder
that
after
more
than
three
years
it
had
preserved
its
*NL*
actuality
,
you
must
know
that
I
had
seen
him
only
very
lately
.
I
had
*NL*
come
straight
from
Samarang
,
where
I
had
loaded
a
cargo
for
Sydney
:
an
*NL*
utterly
uninteresting
bit
of
business
,
--
what
Charley
here
would
call
one
*NL*
of
my
rational
transactions
,
--
and
in
Samarang
I
had
seen
something
*NL*
of
Jim
.
He
was
then
working
for
De
Jongh
,
on
my
recommendation
.
*NL*
Water-clerk
.
``
My
representative
afloat
,
''
as
De
Jongh
called
him
.
You
*NL*
ca
n't
imagine
a
mode
of
life
more
barren
of
consolation
,
less
capable
of
*NL*
being
invested
with
a
spark
of
glamour
--
unless
it
be
the
business
of
an
*NL*
insurance
canvasser
.
Little
Bob
Stanton
--
Charley
here
knew
him
well
--
had
*NL*
gone
through
that
experience
.
The
same
who
got
drowned
afterwards
trying
*NL*
to
save
a
lady
's
-
maid
in
the
Sephora
disaster
.
A
case
of
collision
on
a
*NL*
hazy
morning
off
the
Spanish
coast
--
you
may
remember
.
All
the
passengers
*NL*
had
been
packed
tidily
into
the
boats
and
shoved
clear
of
the
ship
,
when
*NL*
Bob
sheered
alongside
again
and
scrambled
back
on
deck
to
fetch
that
*NL*
girl
.
How
she
had
been
left
behind
I
ca
n't
make
out
;
anyhow
,
she
had
*NL*
gone
completely
crazy
--
would
n't
leave
the
ship
--
held
to
the
rail
like
*NL*
grim
death
.
The
wrestling-match
could
be
seen
plainly
from
the
boats
;
*NL*
but
poor
Bob
was
the
shortest
chief
mate
in
the
merchant
service
,
and
*NL*
the
woman
stood
five
feet
ten
in
her
shoes
and
was
as
strong
as
a
horse
,
*NL*
I
've
been
told
.
So
it
went
on
,
pull
devil
,
pull
baker
,
the
wretched
girl
*NL*
screaming
all
the
time
,
and
Bob
letting
out
a
yell
now
and
then
to
*NL*
warn
his
boat
to
keep
well
clear
of
the
ship
.
One
of
the
hands
told
me
,
*NL*
hiding
a
smile
at
the
recollection
,
``
It
was
for
all
the
world
,
sir
,
like
*NL*
a
naughty
youngster
fighting
with
his
mother
.
''
The
same
old
chap
said
*NL*
that
``
At
the
last
we
could
see
that
Mr.
Stanton
had
given
up
hauling
*NL*
at
the
gal
,
and
just
stood
by
looking
at
her
,
watchful
like
.
We
thought
*NL*
afterwards
he
must
've
been
reckoning
that
,
maybe
,
the
rush
of
water
*NL*
would
tear
her
away
from
the
rail
by-and-by
and
give
him
a
show
to
save
*NL*
her
.
We
dare
n't
come
alongside
for
our
life
;
and
after
a
bit
the
old
*NL*
ship
went
down
all
on
a
sudden
with
a
lurch
to
starboard
--
plop
.
The
suck
*NL*
in
was
something
awful
.
We
never
saw
anything
alive
or
dead
come
up
.
''
*NL*
Poor
Bob
's
spell
of
shore-life
had
been
one
of
the
complications
of
a
*NL*
love
affair
,
I
believe
.
He
fondly
hoped
he
had
done
with
the
sea
for
*NL*
ever
,
and
made
sure
he
had
got
hold
of
all
the
bliss
on
earth
,
but
it
*NL*
came
to
canvassing
in
the
end
.
Some
cousin
of
his
in
Liverpool
put
up
*NL*
to
it
.
He
used
to
tell
us
his
experiences
in
that
line
.
He
made
us
laugh
*NL*
till
we
cried
,
and
,
not
altogether
displeased
at
the
effect
,
undersized
*NL*
and
bearded
to
the
waist
like
a
gnome
,
he
would
tiptoe
amongst
us
and
*NL*
say
,
``
It
's
all
very
well
for
you
beggars
to
laugh
,
but
my
immortal
soul
*NL*
was
shrivelled
down
to
the
size
of
a
parched
pea
after
a
week
of
that
*NL*
work
.
''
I
do
n't
know
how
Jim
's
soul
accommodated
itself
to
the
new
*NL*
conditions
of
his
life
--
I
was
kept
too
busy
in
getting
him
something
to
*NL*
do
that
would
keep
body
and
soul
together
--
but
I
am
pretty
certain
his
*NL*
adventurous
fancy
was
suffering
all
the
pangs
of
starvation
.
It
had
*NL*
certainly
nothing
to
feed
upon
in
this
new
calling
.
It
was
distressing
*NL*
to
see
him
at
it
,
though
he
tackled
it
with
a
stubborn
serenity
for
*NL*
which
I
must
give
him
full
credit
.
I
kept
my
eye
on
his
shabby
plodding
*NL*
with
a
sort
of
notion
that
it
was
a
punishment
for
the
heroics
of
his
*NL*
fancy
--
an
expiation
for
his
craving
after
more
glamour
than
he
could
*NL*
carry
.
He
had
loved
too
well
to
imagine
himself
a
glorious
racehorse
,
*NL*
and
now
he
was
condemned
to
toil
without
honour
like
a
costermonger
's
*NL*
donkey
.
He
did
it
very
well
.
He
shut
himself
in
,
put
his
head
down
,
said
*NL*
never
a
word
.
Very
well
;
very
well
indeed
--
except
for
certain
*NL*
fantastic
and
violent
outbreaks
,
on
the
deplorable
occasions
when
the
*NL*
irrepressible
Patna
case
cropped
up
.
Unfortunately
that
scandal
of
the
*NL*
Eastern
seas
would
not
die
out
.
And
this
is
the
reason
why
I
could
never
*NL*
feel
I
had
done
with
Jim
for
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
sat
thinking
of
him
after
the
French
lieutenant
had
left
,
not
,
*NL*
however
,
in
connection
with
De
Jongh
's
cool
and
gloomy
backshop
,
where
*NL*
we
had
hurriedly
shaken
hands
not
very
long
ago
,
but
as
I
had
seen
him
*NL*
years
before
in
the
last
flickers
of
the
candle
,
alone
with
me
in
the
*NL*
long
gallery
of
the
Malabar
House
,
with
the
chill
and
the
darkness
of
*NL*
the
night
at
his
back
.
The
respectable
sword
of
his
country
's
law
was
*NL*
suspended
over
his
head
.
To-morrow
--
or
was
it
to-day
?
-LRB-
midnight
had
*NL*
slipped
by
long
before
we
parted
-RRB-
--
the
marble-faced
police
*NL*
magistrate
,
after
distributing
fines
and
terms
of
imprisonment
in
the
*NL*
assault-and-battery
case
,
would
take
up
the
awful
weapon
and
smite
his
*NL*
bowed
neck
.
Our
communion
in
the
night
was
uncommonly
like
a
last
vigil
*NL*
with
a
condemned
man
.
He
was
guilty
too
.
He
was
guilty
--
as
I
had
told
*NL*
myself
repeatedly
,
guilty
and
done
for
;
nevertheless
,
I
wished
to
spare
*NL*
him
the
mere
detail
of
a
formal
execution
.
I
do
n't
pretend
to
explain
*NL*
the
reasons
of
my
desire
--
I
do
n't
think
I
could
;
but
if
you
have
n't
got
*NL*
a
sort
of
notion
by
this
time
,
then
I
must
have
been
very
obscure
in
*NL*
my
narrative
,
or
you
too
sleepy
to
seize
upon
the
sense
of
my
words
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
defend
my
morality
.
There
was
no
morality
in
the
impulse
which
*NL*
induced
me
to
lay
before
him
Brierly
's
plan
of
evasion
--
I
may
call
*NL*
it
--
in
all
its
primitive
simplicity
.
There
were
the
rupees
--
absolutely
*NL*
ready
in
my
pocket
and
very
much
at
his
service
.
Oh
!
a
loan
;
a
loan
of
*NL*
course
--
and
if
an
introduction
to
a
man
-LRB-
in
Rangoon
-RRB-
who
could
put
some
*NL*
work
in
his
way
...
Why
!
with
the
greatest
pleasure
.
I
had
pen
,
ink
,
*NL*
and
paper
in
my
room
on
the
first
floor
And
even
while
I
was
speaking
I
*NL*
was
impatient
to
begin
the
letter
--
day
,
month
,
year
,
2.30
A.M.
...
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
our
old
friendship
I
ask
you
to
put
some
work
in
the
way
of
*NL*
Mr.
James
So-and-so
,
in
whom
,
&
c.
,
&
c.
...
I
was
even
ready
to
write
*NL*
in
that
strain
about
him
.
If
he
had
not
enlisted
my
sympathies
he
had
*NL*
done
better
for
himself
--
he
had
gone
to
the
very
fount
and
origin
of
*NL*
that
sentiment
he
had
reached
the
secret
sensibility
of
my
egoism
.
I
*NL*
am
concealing
nothing
from
you
,
because
were
I
to
do
so
my
action
would
*NL*
appear
more
unintelligible
than
any
man
's
action
has
the
right
to
be
,
*NL*
and
--
in
the
second
place
--
to-morrow
you
will
forget
my
sincerity
along
*NL*
with
the
other
lessons
of
the
past
.
In
this
transaction
,
to
speak
*NL*
grossly
and
precisely
,
I
was
the
irreproachable
man
;
but
the
subtle
*NL*
intentions
of
my
immorality
were
defeated
by
the
moral
simplicity
of
the
*NL*
criminal
.
No
doubt
he
was
selfish
too
,
but
his
selfishness
had
a
higher
*NL*
origin
,
a
more
lofty
aim
.
I
discovered
that
,
say
what
I
would
,
he
was
*NL*
eager
to
go
through
the
ceremony
of
execution
,
and
I
did
n't
say
much
,
*NL*
for
I
felt
that
in
argument
his
youth
would
tell
against
me
heavily
:
he
*NL*
believed
where
I
had
already
ceased
to
doubt
.
There
was
something
fine
*NL*
in
the
wildness
of
his
unexpressed
,
hardly
formulated
hope
.
``
Clear
out
!
*NL*
Could
n't
think
of
it
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
shake
of
the
head
.
``
I
make
you
*NL*
an
offer
for
which
I
neither
demand
nor
expect
any
sort
of
gratitude
,
''
*NL*
I
said
;
``
you
shall
repay
the
money
when
convenient
,
and
...
''
``
Awfully
*NL*
good
of
you
,
''
he
muttered
without
looking
up
.
I
watched
him
narrowly
:
*NL*
the
future
must
have
appeared
horribly
uncertain
to
him
;
but
he
did
not
*NL*
falter
,
as
though
indeed
there
had
been
nothing
wrong
with
his
heart
.
*NL*
I
felt
angry
--
not
for
the
first
time
that
night
.
``
The
whole
wretched
*NL*
business
,
''
I
said
,
``
is
bitter
enough
,
I
should
think
,
for
a
man
of
your
*NL*
kind
...
''
``
It
is
,
it
is
,
''
he
whispered
twice
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
*NL*
the
floor
.
It
was
heartrending
.
He
towered
above
the
light
,
and
I
could
*NL*
see
the
down
on
his
cheek
,
the
colour
mantling
warm
under
the
smooth
*NL*
skin
of
his
face
.
Believe
me
or
not
,
I
say
it
was
outrageously
*NL*
heartrending
.
It
provoked
me
to
brutality
.
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
;
``
and
allow
me
*NL*
to
confess
that
I
am
totally
unable
to
imagine
what
advantage
you
can
*NL*
expect
from
this
licking
of
the
dregs
.
''
``
Advantage
!
''
he
murmured
out
of
*NL*
his
stillness
.
``
I
am
dashed
if
I
do
,
''
I
said
,
enraged
.
``
I
've
been
trying
*NL*
to
tell
you
all
there
is
in
it
,
''
he
went
on
slowly
,
as
if
meditating
*NL*
something
unanswerable
.
``
But
after
all
,
it
is
_
my
_
trouble
.
''
I
opened
my
*NL*
mouth
to
retort
,
and
discovered
suddenly
that
I
'd
lost
all
confidence
in
*NL*
myself
;
and
it
was
as
if
he
too
had
given
me
up
,
for
he
mumbled
like
a
*NL*
man
thinking
half
aloud
.
``
Went
away
...
went
into
hospitals
...
Not
*NL*
one
of
them
would
face
it
...
They
!
...
''
He
moved
his
hand
slightly
*NL*
to
imply
disdain
.
``
But
I
've
got
to
get
over
this
thing
,
and
I
must
n't
*NL*
shirk
any
of
it
or
...
I
wo
n't
shirk
any
of
it
.
''
He
was
silent
.
He
*NL*
gazed
as
though
he
had
been
haunted
.
His
unconscious
face
reflected
the
*NL*
passing
expressions
of
scorn
,
of
despair
,
of
resolution
--
reflected
*NL*
them
in
turn
,
as
a
magic
mirror
would
reflect
the
gliding
passage
of
*NL*
unearthly
shapes
.
He
lived
surrounded
by
deceitful
ghosts
,
by
austere
*NL*
shades
.
``
Oh
!
nonsense
,
my
dear
fellow
,
''
I
began
.
He
had
a
movement
of
*NL*
impatience
.
``
You
do
n't
seem
to
understand
,
''
he
said
incisively
;
then
*NL*
looking
at
me
without
a
wink
,
``
I
may
have
jumped
,
but
I
do
n't
run
away
.
''
*NL*
``
I
meant
no
offence
,
''
I
said
;
and
added
stupidly
,
``
Better
men
than
you
*NL*
have
found
it
expedient
to
run
,
at
times
.
''
He
coloured
all
over
,
while
*NL*
in
my
confusion
I
half-choked
myself
with
my
own
tongue
.
``
Perhaps
so
,
''
*NL*
he
said
at
last
,
``
I
am
not
good
enough
;
I
ca
n't
afford
it
.
I
am
bound
to
*NL*
fight
this
thing
down
--
I
am
fighting
it
now
.
''
I
got
out
of
my
chair
and
*NL*
felt
stiff
all
over
.
The
silence
was
embarrassing
,
and
to
put
an
end
*NL*
to
it
I
imagined
nothing
better
but
to
remark
,
``
I
had
no
idea
it
was
so
*NL*
late
,
''
in
an
airy
tone
...
``
I
dare
say
you
have
had
enough
of
this
,
''
*NL*
he
said
brusquely
:
``
and
to
tell
you
the
truth
''
--
he
began
to
look
round
*NL*
for
his
hat
--
``
so
have
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Well
!
he
had
refused
this
unique
offer
.
He
had
struck
aside
my
helping
*NL*
hand
;
he
was
ready
to
go
now
,
and
beyond
the
balustrade
the
night
seemed
*NL*
to
wait
for
him
very
still
,
as
though
he
had
been
marked
down
for
its
*NL*
prey
.
I
heard
his
voice
.
``
Ah
!
here
it
is
.
''
He
had
found
his
hat
.
For
a
*NL*
few
seconds
we
hung
in
the
wind
.
``
What
will
you
do
after
--
after
...
''
*NL*
I
asked
very
low
.
``
Go
to
the
dogs
as
likely
as
not
,
''
he
answered
in
a
*NL*
gruff
mutter
.
I
had
recovered
my
wits
in
a
measure
,
and
judged
best
to
*NL*
take
it
lightly
.
``
Pray
remember
,
''
I
said
,
``
that
I
should
like
very
much
*NL*
to
see
you
again
before
you
go
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
what
's
to
prevent
*NL*
you
.
The
damned
thing
wo
n't
make
me
invisible
,
''
he
said
with
intense
*NL*
bitterness
,
--
``
no
such
luck
.
''
And
then
at
the
moment
of
taking
leave
he
*NL*
treated
me
to
a
ghastly
muddle
of
dubious
stammers
and
movements
,
to
an
*NL*
awful
display
of
hesitations
.
God
forgive
him
--
me
!
He
had
taken
it
*NL*
into
his
fanciful
head
that
I
was
likely
to
make
some
difficulty
as
to
*NL*
shaking
hands
.
It
was
too
awful
for
words
.
I
believe
I
shouted
suddenly
*NL*
at
him
as
you
would
bellow
to
a
man
you
saw
about
to
walk
over
a
cliff
;
*NL*
I
remember
our
voices
being
raised
,
the
appearance
of
a
miserable
grin
*NL*
on
his
face
,
a
crushing
clutch
on
my
hand
,
a
nervous
laugh
.
The
candle
*NL*
spluttered
out
,
and
the
thing
was
over
at
last
,
with
a
groan
that
*NL*
floated
up
to
me
in
the
dark
.
He
got
himself
away
somehow
.
The
night
*NL*
swallowed
his
form
.
He
was
a
horrible
bungler
.
Horrible
.
I
heard
the
*NL*
quick
crunch-crunch
of
the
gravel
under
his
boots
.
He
was
running
.
*NL*
Absolutely
running
,
with
nowhere
to
go
to
.
And
he
was
not
yet
*NL*
four-and-twenty
.

CHAPTER
14
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
slept
little
,
hurried
over
my
breakfast
,
and
after
a
slight
*NL*
hesitation
gave
up
my
early
morning
visit
to
my
ship
.
It
was
really
*NL*
very
wrong
of
me
,
because
,
though
my
chief
mate
was
an
excellent
man
all
*NL*
round
,
he
was
the
victim
of
such
black
imaginings
that
if
he
did
not
get
*NL*
a
letter
from
his
wife
at
the
expected
time
he
would
go
quite
distracted
*NL*
with
rage
and
jealousy
,
lose
all
grip
on
the
work
,
quarrel
with
all
*NL*
hands
,
and
either
weep
in
his
cabin
or
develop
such
a
ferocity
of
temper
*NL*
as
all
but
drove
the
crew
to
the
verge
of
mutiny
.
The
thing
had
always
*NL*
seemed
inexplicable
to
me
:
they
had
been
married
thirteen
years
;
I
had
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
her
once
,
and
,
honestly
,
I
could
n't
conceive
a
man
abandoned
*NL*
enough
to
plunge
into
sin
for
the
sake
of
such
an
unattractive
person
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
whether
I
have
not
done
wrong
by
refraining
from
putting
*NL*
that
view
before
poor
Selvin
:
the
man
made
a
little
hell
on
earth
for
*NL*
himself
,
and
I
also
suffered
indirectly
,
but
some
sort
of
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
false
delicacy
prevented
me
.
The
marital
relations
of
seamen
would
make
*NL*
an
interesting
subject
,
and
I
could
tell
you
instances
...
However
,
*NL*
this
is
not
the
place
,
nor
the
time
,
and
we
are
concerned
with
Jim
--
who
*NL*
was
unmarried
.
If
his
imaginative
conscience
or
his
pride
;
if
all
the
*NL*
extravagant
ghosts
and
austere
shades
that
were
the
disastrous
familiars
*NL*
of
his
youth
would
not
let
him
run
away
from
the
block
,
I
,
who
of
course
*NL*
ca
n't
be
suspected
of
such
familiars
,
was
irresistibly
impelled
to
go
*NL*
and
see
his
head
roll
off
.
I
wended
my
way
towards
the
court
.
I
did
n't
*NL*
hope
to
be
very
much
impressed
or
edified
,
or
interested
or
even
*NL*
frightened
--
though
,
as
long
as
there
is
any
life
before
one
,
a
jolly
*NL*
good
fright
now
and
then
is
a
salutary
discipline
.
But
neither
did
I
*NL*
expect
to
be
so
awfully
depressed
.
The
bitterness
of
his
punishment
was
*NL*
in
its
chill
and
mean
atmosphere
.
The
real
significance
of
crime
is
in
*NL*
its
being
a
breach
of
faith
with
the
community
of
mankind
,
and
from
*NL*
that
point
of
view
he
was
no
mean
traitor
,
but
his
execution
was
a
*NL*
hole-and-corner
affair
.
There
was
no
high
scaffolding
,
no
scarlet
cloth
*NL*
-LRB-
did
they
have
scarlet
cloth
on
Tower
Hill
?
They
should
have
had
-RRB-
,
no
*NL*
awe-stricken
multitude
to
be
horrified
at
his
guilt
and
be
moved
to
*NL*
tears
at
his
fate
--
no
air
of
sombre
retribution
.
There
was
,
as
I
walked
*NL*
along
,
the
clear
sunshine
,
a
brilliance
too
passionate
to
be
consoling
,
*NL*
the
streets
full
of
jumbled
bits
of
colour
like
a
damaged
kaleidoscope
:
*NL*
yellow
,
green
,
blue
,
dazzling
white
,
the
brown
nudity
of
an
undraped
*NL*
shoulder
,
a
bullock-cart
with
a
red
canopy
,
a
company
of
native
infantry
*NL*
in
a
drab
body
with
dark
heads
marching
in
dusty
laced
boots
,
a
native
*NL*
policeman
in
a
sombre
uniform
of
scanty
cut
and
belted
in
patent
*NL*
leather
,
who
looked
up
at
me
with
orientally
pitiful
eyes
as
though
his
*NL*
migrating
spirit
were
suffering
exceedingly
from
that
unforeseen
--
what
*NL*
d'ye
call
'em
?
--
avatar
--
incarnation
.
Under
the
shade
of
a
lonely
tree
*NL*
in
the
courtyard
,
the
villagers
connected
with
the
assault
case
sat
in
a
*NL*
picturesque
group
,
looking
like
a
chromo-lithograph
of
a
camp
in
a
book
*NL*
of
Eastern
travel
.
One
missed
the
obligatory
thread
of
smoke
in
the
*NL*
foreground
and
the
pack-animals
grazing
.
A
blank
yellow
wall
rose
behind
*NL*
overtopping
the
tree
,
reflecting
the
glare
.
The
court-room
was
sombre
,
*NL*
seemed
more
vast
.
High
up
in
the
dim
space
the
punkahs
were
swaying
*NL*
short
to
and
fro
,
to
and
fro
.
Here
and
there
a
draped
figure
,
dwarfed
*NL*
by
the
bare
walls
,
remained
without
stirring
amongst
the
rows
of
empty
*NL*
benches
,
as
if
absorbed
in
pious
meditation
.
The
plaintiff
,
who
had
*NL*
been
beaten
,
--
an
obese
chocolate-coloured
man
with
shaved
head
,
one
*NL*
fat
breast
bare
and
a
bright
yellow
caste-mark
above
the
bridge
of
his
*NL*
nose
,
--
sat
in
pompous
immobility
:
only
his
eyes
glittered
,
rolling
*NL*
in
the
gloom
,
and
the
nostrils
dilated
and
collapsed
violently
as
he
*NL*
breathed
.
Brierly
dropped
into
his
seat
looking
done
up
,
as
though
*NL*
he
had
spent
the
night
in
sprinting
on
a
cinder-track
.
The
pious
*NL*
sailing-ship
skipper
appeared
excited
and
made
uneasy
movements
,
as
*NL*
if
restraining
with
difficulty
an
impulse
to
stand
up
and
exhort
*NL*
us
earnestly
to
prayer
and
repentance
.
The
head
of
the
magistrate
,
*NL*
delicately
pale
under
the
neatly
arranged
hair
,
resembled
the
head
of
a
*NL*
hopeless
invalid
after
he
had
been
washed
and
brushed
and
propped
up
in
*NL*
bed
.
He
moved
aside
the
vase
of
flowers
--
a
bunch
of
purple
with
a
few
*NL*
pink
blossoms
on
long
stalks
--
and
seizing
in
both
hands
a
long
sheet
of
*NL*
bluish
paper
,
ran
his
eye
over
it
,
propped
his
forearms
on
the
edge
of
*NL*
the
desk
,
and
began
to
read
aloud
in
an
even
,
distinct
,
and
careless
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
Jove
!
For
all
my
foolishness
about
scaffolds
and
heads
rolling
*NL*
off
--
I
assure
you
it
was
infinitely
worse
than
a
beheading
.
A
heavy
*NL*
sense
of
finality
brooded
over
all
this
,
unrelieved
by
the
hope
of
rest
*NL*
and
safety
following
the
fall
of
the
axe
.
These
proceedings
had
all
the
*NL*
cold
vengefulness
of
a
death-sentence
,
and
the
cruelty
of
a
sentence
of
*NL*
exile
.
This
is
how
I
looked
at
it
that
morning
--
and
even
now
I
seem
to
*NL*
see
an
undeniable
vestige
of
truth
in
that
exaggerated
view
of
a
common
*NL*
occurrence
.
You
may
imagine
how
strongly
I
felt
this
at
the
time
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
is
for
that
reason
that
I
could
not
bring
myself
to
admit
*NL*
the
finality
.
The
thing
was
always
with
me
,
I
was
always
eager
to
take
*NL*
opinion
on
it
,
as
though
it
had
not
been
practically
settled
:
individual
*NL*
opinion
--
international
opinion
--
by
Jove
!
That
Frenchman
's
,
for
instance
.
*NL*
His
own
country
's
pronouncement
was
uttered
in
the
passionless
and
*NL*
definite
phraseology
a
machine
would
use
,
if
machines
could
speak
.
The
*NL*
head
of
the
magistrate
was
half
hidden
by
the
paper
,
his
brow
was
like
*NL*
alabaster
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
were
several
questions
before
the
court
.
The
first
as
to
whether
*NL*
the
ship
was
in
every
respect
fit
and
seaworthy
for
the
voyage
.
The
*NL*
court
found
she
was
not
.
The
next
point
,
I
remember
,
was
,
whether
up
*NL*
to
the
time
of
the
accident
the
ship
had
been
navigated
with
proper
and
*NL*
seamanlike
care
.
They
said
Yes
to
that
,
goodness
knows
why
,
and
then
*NL*
they
declared
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
the
exact
cause
of
*NL*
the
accident
.
A
floating
derelict
probably
.
I
myself
remember
that
a
*NL*
Norwegian
barque
bound
out
with
a
cargo
of
pitch-pine
had
been
given
up
*NL*
as
missing
about
that
time
,
and
it
was
just
the
sort
of
craft
that
would
*NL*
capsize
in
a
squall
and
float
bottom
up
for
months
--
a
kind
of
maritime
*NL*
ghoul
on
the
prowl
to
kill
ships
in
the
dark
.
Such
wandering
corpses
are
*NL*
common
enough
in
the
North
Atlantic
,
which
is
haunted
by
all
the
terrors
*NL*
of
the
sea
,
--
fogs
,
icebergs
,
dead
ships
bent
upon
mischief
,
and
long
*NL*
sinister
gales
that
fasten
upon
one
like
a
vampire
till
all
the
strength
*NL*
and
the
spirit
and
even
hope
are
gone
,
and
one
feels
like
the
empty
*NL*
shell
of
a
man
.
But
there
--
in
those
seas
--
the
incident
was
rare
enough
*NL*
to
resemble
a
special
arrangement
of
a
malevolent
providence
,
which
,
*NL*
unless
it
had
for
its
object
the
killing
of
a
donkeyman
and
the
bringing
*NL*
of
worse
than
death
upon
Jim
,
appeared
an
utterly
aimless
piece
of
*NL*
devilry
.
This
view
occurring
to
me
took
off
my
attention
.
For
a
time
I
*NL*
was
aware
of
the
magistrate
's
voice
as
a
sound
merely
;
but
in
a
moment
*NL*
it
shaped
itself
into
distinct
words
...
``
in
utter
disregard
of
their
*NL*
plain
duty
,
''
it
said
.
The
next
sentence
escaped
me
somehow
,
and
*NL*
then
...
``
abandoning
in
the
moment
of
danger
the
lives
and
property
*NL*
confided
to
their
charge
''
...
went
on
the
voice
evenly
,
and
stopped
.
A
*NL*
pair
of
eyes
under
the
white
forehead
shot
darkly
a
glance
above
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
paper
.
I
looked
for
Jim
hurriedly
,
as
though
I
had
expected
*NL*
him
to
disappear
.
He
was
very
still
--
but
he
was
there
.
He
sat
pink
and
*NL*
fair
and
extremely
attentive
.
``
Therefore
,
...
''
began
the
voice
*NL*
emphatically
.
He
stared
with
parted
lips
,
hanging
upon
the
words
of
the
*NL*
man
behind
the
desk
.
These
came
out
into
the
stillness
wafted
on
the
*NL*
wind
made
by
the
punkahs
,
and
I
,
watching
for
their
effect
upon
him
,
*NL*
caught
only
the
fragments
of
official
language
...
``
The
Court
...
*NL*
Gustav
So-and-so
...
master
...
native
of
Germany
...
James
*NL*
So-and-so
...
mate
...
certificates
cancelled
.
''
A
silence
fell
.
The
*NL*
magistrate
had
dropped
the
paper
,
and
,
leaning
sideways
on
the
arm
of
*NL*
his
chair
,
began
to
talk
with
Brierly
easily
.
People
started
to
move
*NL*
out
;
others
were
pushing
in
,
and
I
also
made
for
the
door
.
Outside
I
*NL*
stood
still
,
and
when
Jim
passed
me
on
his
way
to
the
gate
,
I
caught
at
*NL*
his
arm
and
detained
him
.
The
look
he
gave
discomposed
me
,
as
though
I
*NL*
had
been
responsible
for
his
state
he
looked
at
me
as
if
I
had
been
the
*NL*
embodied
evil
of
life
.
``
It
's
all
over
,
''
I
stammered
.
``
Yes
,
''
he
said
*NL*
thickly
.
``
And
now
let
no
man
...
''
He
jerked
his
arm
out
of
my
grasp
.
I
*NL*
watched
his
back
as
he
went
away
.
It
was
a
long
street
,
and
he
remained
*NL*
in
sight
for
some
time
.
He
walked
rather
slow
,
and
straddling
his
legs
a
*NL*
little
,
as
if
he
had
found
it
difficult
to
keep
a
straight
line
.
Just
*NL*
before
I
lost
him
I
fancied
he
staggered
a
bit
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Man
overboard
,
''
said
a
deep
voice
behind
me
.
Turning
round
,
I
saw
a
*NL*
fellow
I
knew
slightly
,
a
West
Australian
;
Chester
was
his
name
.
He
,
*NL*
too
,
had
been
looking
after
Jim
.
He
was
a
man
with
an
immense
girth
of
*NL*
chest
,
a
rugged
,
clean-shaved
face
of
mahogany
colour
,
and
two
blunt
*NL*
tufts
of
iron-grey
,
thick
,
wiry
hairs
on
his
upper
lip
.
He
had
*NL*
been
pearler
,
wrecker
,
trader
,
whaler
too
,
I
believe
;
in
his
own
*NL*
words
--
anything
and
everything
a
man
may
be
at
sea
,
but
a
pirate
.
The
*NL*
Pacific
,
north
and
south
,
was
his
proper
hunting-ground
;
but
he
had
*NL*
wandered
so
far
afield
looking
for
a
cheap
steamer
to
buy
.
Lately
he
*NL*
had
discovered
--
so
he
said
--
a
guano
island
somewhere
,
but
its
approaches
*NL*
were
dangerous
,
and
the
anchorage
,
such
as
it
was
,
could
not
be
*NL*
considered
safe
,
to
say
the
least
of
it
.
``
As
good
as
a
gold-mine
,
''
he
*NL*
would
exclaim
.
``
Right
bang
in
the
middle
of
the
Walpole
Reefs
,
and
if
*NL*
it
's
true
enough
that
you
can
get
no
holding-ground
anywhere
in
less
*NL*
than
forty
fathom
,
then
what
of
that
?
There
are
the
hurricanes
,
too
.
But
*NL*
it
's
a
first-rate
thing
.
As
good
as
a
gold-mine
--
better
!
Yet
there
's
not
*NL*
a
fool
of
them
that
will
see
it
.
I
ca
n't
get
a
skipper
or
a
shipowner
*NL*
to
go
near
the
place
.
So
I
made
up
my
mind
to
cart
the
blessed
stuff
*NL*
myself
.
''
...
This
was
what
he
required
a
steamer
for
,
and
I
knew
he
*NL*
was
just
then
negotiating
enthusiastically
with
a
Parsee
firm
for
an
*NL*
old
,
brig-rigged
,
sea-anachronism
of
ninety
horse-power
.
We
had
met
and
*NL*
spoken
together
several
times
.
He
looked
knowingly
after
Jim
.
``
Takes
*NL*
it
to
heart
?
''
he
asked
scornfully
.
``
Very
much
,
''
I
said
.
``
Then
he
's
no
*NL*
good
,
''
he
opined
.
``
What
's
all
the
to-do
about
?
A
bit
of
ass
's
skin
.
That
*NL*
never
yet
made
a
man
.
You
must
see
things
exactly
as
they
are
--
if
you
*NL*
do
n't
,
you
may
just
as
well
give
in
at
once
.
You
will
never
do
anything
*NL*
in
this
world
.
Look
at
me
.
I
made
it
a
practice
never
to
take
anything
*NL*
to
heart
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
``
you
see
things
as
they
are
.
''
``
I
wish
I
could
*NL*
see
my
partner
coming
along
,
that
's
what
I
wish
to
see

''
he
said
.
``
Know
*NL*
my
partner
?
Old
Robinson
.
Yes
;
_
the
_
Robinson

Do
n't
_
you

know
?
The
*NL*
notorious
Robinson
.
The
man
who
smuggled
more
opium
and
bagged
more
*NL*
seals
in
his
time
than
any
loose
Johnny
now
alive
.
They
say
he
used
to
*NL*
board
the
sealing-schooners
up
Alaska
way
when
the
fog
was
so
thick
that
*NL*
the
Lord
God
,
He
alone
,
could
tell
one
man
from
another
.
Holy-Terror
*NL*
Robinson
.
That
's
the
man
.
He
is
with
me
in
that
guano
thing
.
The
best
*NL*
chance
he
ever
came
across
in
his
life
.
''
He
put
his
lips
to
my
ear
.
*NL*
``
Cannibal
?
--
well
,
they
used
to
give
him
the
name
years
and
years
ago
.
*NL*
You
remember
the
story
?
A
shipwreck
on
the
west
side
of
Stewart
Island
;
*NL*
that
's
right
;
seven
of
them
got
ashore
,
and
it
seems
they
did
not
get
*NL*
on
very
well
together
.
Some
men
are
too
cantankerous
for
anything
--
do
n't
*NL*
know
how
to
make
the
best
of
a
bad
job
--
do
n't
see
things
as
they
are
--
as
*NL*
they
_
are
_
,
my
boy
!
And
then
what
's
the
consequence
?
Obvious
!
Trouble
,
*NL*
trouble
;
as
likely
as
not
a
knock
on
the
head
;
and
serve
'em
right
too
.
*NL*
That
sort
is
the
most
useful
when
it
's
dead
.
The
story
goes
that
a
boat
*NL*
of
Her
Majesty
's
ship
Wolverine
found
him
kneeling
on
the
kelp
,
naked
as
*NL*
the
day
he
was
born
,
and
chanting
some
psalm-tune
or
other
;
light
snow
*NL*
was
falling
at
the
time
.
He
waited
till
the
boat
was
an
oar
's
length
*NL*
from
the
shore
,
and
then
up
and
away
.
They
chased
him
for
an
hour
up
and
*NL*
down
the
boulders
,
till
a
marihe
flung
a
stone
that
took
him
behind
*NL*
the
ear
providentially
and
knocked
him
senseless
.
Alone
?
Of
course
.
But
*NL*
that
's
like
that
tale
of
sealing-schooners
;
the
Lord
God
knows
the
right
*NL*
and
the
wrong
of
that
story
.
The
cutter
did
not
investigate
much
.
They
*NL*
wrapped
him
in
a
boat-cloak
and
took
him
off
as
quick
as
they
could
,
*NL*
with
a
dark
night
coming
on
,
the
weather
threatening
,
and
the
ship
*NL*
firing
recall
guns
every
five
minutes
.
Three
weeks
afterwards
he
was
as
*NL*
well
as
ever
.
He
did
n't
allow
any
fuss
that
was
made
on
shore
to
upset
*NL*
him
;
he
just
shut
his
lips
tight
,
and
let
people
screech
.
It
was
bad
*NL*
enough
to
have
lost
his
ship
,
and
all
he
was
worth
besides
,
without
*NL*
paying
attention
to
the
hard
names
they
called
him
.
That
's
the
man
for
*NL*
me
.
''
He
lifted
his
arm
for
a
signal
to
some
one
down
the
street
.
``
He
's
*NL*
got
a
little
money
,
so
I
had
to
let
him
into
my
thing
.
Had
to
!
It
*NL*
would
have
been
sinful
to
throw
away
such
a
find
,
and
I
was
cleaned
out
*NL*
myself
.
It
cut
me
to
the
quick
,
but
I
could
see
the
matter
just
as
*NL*
it
was
,
and
if
I
_
must
_
share
--
thinks
I
--
with
any
man
,
then
give
me
*NL*
Robinson
.
I
left
him
at
breakfast
in
the
hotel
to
come
to
court
,
because
*NL*
I
've
an
idea
...
Ah
!
Good
morning
,
Captain
Robinson

Friend
of
*NL*
mine
,
Captain
Robinson

''
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
emaciated
patriarch
in
a
suit
of
white
drill
,
a
solah
topi
with
a
*NL*
green-lined
rim
on
a
head
trembling
with
age
,
joined
us
after
crossing
*NL*
the
street
in
a
trotting
shuffle
,
and
stood
propped
with
both
hands
on
*NL*
the
handle
of
an
umbrella
.
A
white
beard
with
amber
streaks
hung
lumpily
*NL*
down
to
his
waist
.
He
blinked
his
creased
eyelids
at
me
in
a
bewildered
*NL*
way
.
``
How
do
you
do
?
how
do
you
do
?
''
he
piped
amiably
,
and
tottered
.
``
A
*NL*
little
deaf
,
''
said
Chester
aside
.
``
Did
you
drag
him
over
six
thousand
*NL*
miles
to
get
a
cheap
steamer
?
''
I
asked
.
``
I
would
have
taken
him
twice
*NL*
round
the
world
as
soon
as
look
at
him
,
''
said
Chester
with
immense
*NL*
energy
.
``
The
steamer
will
be
the
making
of
us

my
lad

Is
it
my
fault
*NL*
that
every
skipper
and
shipowner
in
the
whole
of
blessed
Australasia
*NL*
turns
out
a
blamed
fool
?
Once
I
talked
for
three
hours
to
a
man
in
*NL*
Auckland
.
`
Send
a

'
I
said
,
`
send

I
'll
give
you
half
of

yourself

free

just
to
make
a
good
*NL*
start

Says
he
,
'
I
would
n't
do
it
if
there
was
no
other
place
on
*NL*
earth
to
send
a
ship
to
.
'
Perfect
ass
,
of
course
.
Rocks
,
currents
,
no
*NL*
anchorage
,
sheer
cliff
to
lay
to
,
no
insurance
company
would
take
the
*NL*
risk
,
did
n't
see
how
he
could
get
loaded
under
three
years
.
Ass

I
*NL*
nearly
went
on
my
knees
to
him
.
`
But
look
at
the
thing
as
it
is
,
'
says
*NL*
I.
`
Damn
rocks
and
hurricanes
.
Look
at
it
as
it
is

There
's
guano
there
*NL*
Queensland
sugar-planters
would
fight
for

fight
for
on
the
quay

I
*NL*
tell
you

...
What
can
you
do
with
a
fool
?
...
`
That
's
one
of
your
*NL*
little
jokes
,
Chester
,
'
he
says
...
Joke
!
I
could
have
wept
.
Ask
*NL*
Captain
Robinson
here
...
And
there
was
another
shipowning
fellow
--
a
*NL*
fat
chap
in
a
white
waistcoat
in
Wellington
,
who
seemed
to
think
I
was
*NL*
up
to
some
swindle
or
other
.
'
I
do
n't
know
what
sort
of
fool
you
're
*NL*
looking
for
,
'
he
says
,
`
but
I
am
busy
just
now
.
Good
morning
.
'
I
longed
*NL*
to
take
him
in
my
two
hands
and
smash
him
through
the
window
of
his
own
*NL*
office
.
But
I
did
n't
.
I
was
as
mild
as
a
curate
.
`
Think
of
it
,
'
says
I.
*NL*
'
_
Do
_
think
it
over
.
I
'll
call
to-morrow
.
'
He
grunted
something
about
*NL*
being
`
out
all
day
.
'
On
the
stairs
I
felt
ready
to
beat
my
head
against
*NL*
the
wall
from
vexation
.
Captain
Robinson
here
can
tell
you
.
It
was
awful
*NL*
to
think
of
all
that
lovely
stuff
lying
waste
under
the
sun
--
stuff
that
*NL*
would
send
the
sugar-cane
shooting
sky-high
.
The
making
of
Queensland
!
*NL*
The
making
of
Queensland
!
And
in
Brisbane
,
where
I
went
to
have
a
last
*NL*
try
,
they
gave
me
the
name
of
a
lunatic
.
Idiots
!
The
only
sensible
man
*NL*
I
came
across
was
the
cabman
who
drove
me
about
.
A
broken-down
swell
he
*NL*
was
,
I
fancy
.
Hey
!
Captain
Robinson
?
You
remember
I
told
you
about
my
*NL*
cabby
in
Brisbane
--
do
n't
you
?
The
chap
had
a
wonderful
eye
for
things
.
*NL*
He
saw
it
all
in
a
jiffy
.
It
was
a
real
pleasure
to
talk
with
him
.
One
*NL*
evening
after
a
devil
of
a
day
amongst
shipowners
I
felt
so
bad
that
,
*NL*
says
I
,
'
I
must
get
drunk

Come
along
;
I
must
get
drunk
,
or
I
'll
go
*NL*
mad
.
'
'
I
am
your
man
,
'
he
says
;
`
go
ahead
.
'
I
do
n't
know
what
I
would
*NL*
have
done
without
him
.
Hey
!
Captain
Robinson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
poked
the
ribs
of
his
partner
.
``
He
!
he
!
he
!
''
laughed
the
Ancient
,
*NL*
looked
aimlessly
down
the
street
,
then
peered
at
me
doubtfully
with
sad
,
*NL*
dim
pupils
...
``
He
!
he
!
he
!
''
...
He
leaned
heavier
on
the
umbrella
,
*NL*
and
dropped
his
gaze
on
the
ground
.
I
need
n't
tell
you
I
had
tried
to
*NL*
get
away
several
times
,
but
Chester
had
foiled
every
attempt
by
simply
*NL*
catching
hold
of
my
coat
.
``
One
minute
.
I
've
a
notion

''
``
What
's
your
*NL*
infernal
notion

I
exploded
at
last
.
``
If
you
think

going
in
with
*NL*
you

``
No

no

Too
late

so
much

``
You
've

the
ghost

I
said
.
``
Good

enough
for

nonsense
about

Is
there

Robinson

''
``
No

no

''
croaked
the
old
man
without
lifting
*NL*
his
eyes
,
and
the
senile
tremble
of
his
head
became
almost
fierce
with
*NL*
determination
.
``
I
understand
you
know
that
young
chap

said
Chester
,
*NL*
with
a
nod
at
the
street
from
which
Jim
had
disappeared
long
ago
.
``
He
's
*NL*
been
having
grub
with
you
in
the
Malabar
last
night

so
I
was
told

*NL*
*NL*
'
I
said
that
was
true
,
and
after
remarking
that
he
too
liked
to
live
*NL*
well
and
in
style
,
only
that
,
for
the
present
,
he
had
to
be
saving
of
*NL*
every
penny
--
``
none
too
many
for
the
business
!
Is
n't
that
so
,
Captain
*NL*
Robinson
?
''
--
he
squared
his
shoulders
and
stroked
his
dumpy
moustache
,
*NL*
while
the
notorious
Robinson
,
coughing
at
his
side
,
clung
more
than
ever
*NL*
to
the
handle
of
the
umbrella
,
and
seemed
ready
to
subside
passively
*NL*
into
a
heap
of
old
bones
.
``
You
see
,
the
old
chap
has
all
the
money

*NL*
whispered
Chester
confidentially
.
``
I
've
been
cleaned
out

But
wait
a
bit

a
bit

The
good
time

coming

...
He
seemed
suddenly
astonished
at
the
signs
of
impatience
*NL*
I
gave
.
``
Oh
,
crakee
!

he
cried
;
``
I

biggest
thing
*NL*
that
ever
was

``
I
have
an
appointment

I
pleaded
mildly
.
*NL*
``
What
of
that
?
''
he
asked
with
genuine
surprise
;
``
let
it
wait

``
That
's
*NL*
exactly
what
I
am
doing
now

I
remarked
;

had
n't

better

me

what
it
is
you
want

``
Buy
twenty
hotels

he
growled
to
*NL*
himself
;
``

boarding
in
them
too

twenty
times
over

He
*NL*
lifted
his
head
smartly
``
I
want
that
young
chap

``
I
do

I
said

Chester
crisply

protested

Why

told

He
nodded
significantly

square
:
wooden
shed
,
corrugated-iron
roof
--
I
know
a
man
in
Hobart
*NL*
who
will
take
my
bill
at
six
months
for
the
materials
.
I
do
.
Honour
*NL*
bright
.
Then
there
's
the
water-supply
.
I
'll
have
to
fly
round
and
get
*NL*
somebody
to
trust
me
for
half-a-dozen
second-hand
iron
tanks
.
Catch
*NL*
rain-water
,
hey
?
Let
him
take
charge
.
Make
him
supreme
boss
over
the
*NL*
coolies
.
Good
idea
,
is
n't
it
?
What
do
you
say
?
''
``
There
are
whole
years
*NL*
when
not
a
drop
of
rain
falls
on
Walpole
,
''
I
said
,
too
amazed
to
laugh
.
*NL*
He
bit
his
lip
and
seemed
bothered
.
``
Oh
,
well
,
I
will
fix
up
something
*NL*
for
them
--
or
land
a
supply
.
Hang
it
all
!
That
's
not
the
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
said
nothing
.
I
had
a
rapid
vision
of
Jim
perched
on
a
shadowless
*NL*
rock
,
up
to
his
knees
in
guano
,
with
the
screams
of
sea-birds
in
his
*NL*
ears
,
the
incandescent
ball
of
the
sun
above
his
head
;
the
empty
sky
and
*NL*
the
empty
ocean
all
a-quiver
,
simmering
together
in
the
heat
as
far
as
*NL*
the
eye
could
reach
.
``
I
would
n't
advise
my
worst
enemy
...
''
I
began
.
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
?
''
cried
Chester
;
``
I
mean
to
give
him
a
good
*NL*
screw
--
that
is
,
as
soon
as
the
thing
is
set
going
,
of
course
.
It
's
as
*NL*
easy
as
falling
off
a
log
.
Simply
nothing
to
do
;
two
six-shooters
in
his
*NL*
belt
...
Surely
he
would
n't
be
afraid
of
anything
forty
coolies
could
*NL*
do
--
with
two
six-shooters
and
he
the
only
armed
man
too
!
It
's
much
*NL*
better
than
it
looks
.
I
want
you
to
help
me
to
talk
him
over
.
''
``
No
!
''
*NL*
I
shouted
.
Old
Robinson
lifted
his
bleared
eyes
dismally
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
Chester
looked
at
me
with
infinite
contempt
.
``
So
you
would
n't
advise
*NL*
him
?
''
he
uttered
slowly
.
``
Certainly
not
,
''
I
answered
,
as
indignant
as
*NL*
though
he
had
requested
me
to
help
murder
somebody
;
``
moreover
,
I
am
sure
*NL*
he
would
n't
.
He
is
badly
cut
up
,
but
he
is
n't
mad
as
far
as
I
know
.
''
``
He
*NL*
is
no
earthly
good
for
anything
,
''
Chester
mused
aloud
.
``
He
would
just
*NL*
have
done
for
me
.
If
you
only
could
see
a
thing
as
it
is
,
you
would
*NL*
see
it
's
the
very
thing
for
him
.
And
besides
...
Why
!
it
's
the
most
*NL*
splendid
,
sure
chance
...
''
He
got
angry
suddenly
.
``
I
must
have
a
man
.
*NL*
There
!
...
''
He
stamped
his
foot
and
smiled
unpleasantly
.
``
Anyhow
,
I
*NL*
could
guarantee
the
island
would
n't
sink
under
him
--
and
I
believe
he
*NL*
is
a
bit
particular
on
that
point
.
''
``
Good
morning
,
''
I
said
curtly
.
He
*NL*
looked
at
me
as
though
I
had
been
an
incomprehensible
fool
...
``
Must
*NL*
be
moving
,
Captain
Robinson
,
''
he
yelled
suddenly
into
the
old
man
's
ear
.
*NL*
``
These
Parsee
Johnnies
are
waiting
for
us
to
clinch
the
bargain
.
''
He
*NL*
took
his
partner
under
the
arm
with
a
firm
grip
,
swung
him
round
,
and
,
*NL*
unexpectedly
,
leered
at
me
over
his
shoulder
.
``
I
was
trying
to
do
him
*NL*
a
kindness
,
''
he
asserted
,
with
an
air
and
tone
that
made
my
blood
boil
.
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
nothing
--
in
his
name
,
''
I
rejoined
.
``
Oh
!
you
are
devilish
*NL*
smart
,
''
he
sneered
;
``
but
you
are
like
the
rest
of
them
.
Too
much
in
the
*NL*
clouds
.
See
what
you
will
do
with
him
.
''
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
want
to
*NL*
do
anything
with
him
.
''
``
Do
n't
you
?
''
he
spluttered
;
his
grey
moustache
*NL*
bristled
with
anger
,
and
by
his
side
the
notorious
Robinson
,
propped
*NL*
on
the
umbrella
,
stood
with
his
back
to
me
,
as
patient
and
still
as
a
*NL*
worn-out
cab-horse
.
``
I
have
n't
found
a
guano
island
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
's
*NL*
my
belief
you
would
n't
know
one
if
you
were
led
right
up
to
it
by
the
*NL*
hand
,
''
he
riposted
quickly
;
``
and
in
this
world
you
've
got
to
see
a
thing
*NL*
first
,
before
you
can
make
use
of
it
.
Got
to
see
it
through
and
through
*NL*
at
that
,
neither
more
nor
less
.
''
``
And
get
others
to
see
it
,
too
,
''
I
*NL*
insinuated
,
with
a
glance
at
the
bowed
back
by
his
side
.
Chester
snorted
*NL*
at
me
.
``
His
eyes
are
right
enough
--
do
n't
you
worry
.
He
ai
n't
a
puppy
.
''
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
,
no
!
''
I
said
.
``
Come
along
,
Captain
Robinson
,
''
he
shouted
,
with
*NL*
a
sort
of
bullying
deference
under
the
rim
of
the
old
man
's
hat
;
the
*NL*
Holy
Terror
gave
a
submissive
little
jump
.
The
ghost
of
a
steamer
was
*NL*
waiting
for
them
,
Fortune
on
that
fair
isle
!
They
made
a
curious
pair
*NL*
of
Argonauts
.
Chester
strode
on
leisurely
,
well
set
up
,
portly
,
and
of
*NL*
conquering
mien
;
the
other
,
long
,
wasted
,
drooping
,
and
hooked
to
his
*NL*
arm
,
shuffled
his
withered
shanks
with
desperate
haste
.

CHAPTER
15
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
start
in
search
of
Jim
at
once
,
only
because
I
had
really
an
*NL*
appointment
which
I
could
not
neglect
.
Then
,
as
ill-luck
would
have
*NL*
it
,
in
my
agent
's
office
I
was
fastened
upon
by
a
fellow
fresh
from
*NL*
Madagascar
with
a
little
scheme
for
a
wonderful
piece
of
business
.
It
*NL*
had
something
to
do
with
cattle
and
cartridges
and
a
Prince
Ravonalo
*NL*
something
;
but
the
pivot
of
the
whole
affair
was
the
stupidity
of
some
*NL*
admiral
--
Admiral
Pierre
,
I
think
.
Everything
turned
on
that
,
and
the
*NL*
chap
could
n't
find
words
strong
enough
to
express
his
confidence
.
He
had
*NL*
globular
eyes
starting
out
of
his
head
with
a
fishy
glitter
,
bumps
on
*NL*
his
forehead
,
and
wore
his
long
hair
brushed
back
without
a
parting
.
*NL*
He
had
a
favourite
phrase
which
he
kept
on
repeating
triumphantly
,
``
The
*NL*
minimum
of
risk
with
the
maximum
of
profit
is
my
motto
.
What
?
''
He
made
*NL*
my
head
ache
,
spoiled
my
tiffin
,
but
got
his
own
out
of
me
all
right
;
*NL*
and
as
soon
as
I
had
shaken
him
off
,
I
made
straight
for
the
water-side
.
*NL*
I
caught
sight
of
Jim
leaning
over
the
parapet
of
the
quay
.
Three
native
*NL*
boatmen
quarrelling
over
five
annas
were
making
an
awful
row
at
his
*NL*
elbow
.
He
did
n't
hear
me
come
up
,
but
spun
round
as
if
the
slight
*NL*
contact
of
my
finger
had
released
a
catch
.
``
I
was
looking
,
''
he
*NL*
stammered
.
I
do
n't
remember
what
I
said
,
not
much
anyhow
,
but
he
made
no
*NL*
difficulty
in
following
me
to
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
followed
me
as
manageable
as
a
little
child
,
with
an
obedient
air
,
*NL*
with
no
sort
of
manifestation
,
rather
as
though
he
had
been
waiting
*NL*
for
me
there
to
come
along
and
carry
him
off
.
I
need
not
have
been
so
*NL*
surprised
as
I
was
at
his
tractability
.
On
all
the
round
earth
,
which
to
*NL*
some
seems
so
big
and
that
others
affect
to
consider
as
rather
smaller
*NL*
than
a
mustard-seed
,
he
had
no
place
where
he
could
--
what
shall
I
*NL*
say
?
--
where
he
could
withdraw
.
That
's
it
!
Withdraw
--
be
alone
with
his
*NL*
loneliness
.
He
walked
by
my
side
very
calm
,
glancing
here
and
there
,
and
*NL*
once
turned
his
head
to
look
after
a
Sidiboy
fireman
in
a
cutaway
coat
*NL*
and
yellowish
trousers
,
whose
black
face
had
silky
gleams
like
a
lump
*NL*
of
anthracite
coal
.
I
doubt
,
however
,
whether
he
saw
anything
,
or
even
*NL*
remained
all
the
time
aware
of
my
companionship
,
because
if
I
had
not
*NL*
edged
him
to
the
left
here
,
or
pulled
him
to
the
right
there
,
I
believe
*NL*
he
would
have
gone
straight
before
him
in
any
direction
till
stopped
by
*NL*
a
wall
or
some
other
obstacle
.
I
steered
him
into
my
bedroom
,
and
sat
*NL*
down
at
once
to
write
letters
.
This
was
the
only
place
in
the
world
*NL*
-LRB-
unless
,
perhaps
,
the
Walpole
Reef
--
but
that
was
not
so
handy
-RRB-
where
he
*NL*
could
have
it
out
with
himself
without
being
bothered
by
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
universe
.
The
damned
thing
--
as
he
had
expressed
it
--
had
not
made
*NL*
him
invisible
,
but
I
behaved
exactly
as
though
he
were
.
No
sooner
in
my
*NL*
chair
I
bent
over
my
writing-desk
like
a
medieval
scribe
,
and
,
but
for
*NL*
the
movement
of
the
hand
holding
the
pen
,
remained
anxiously
quiet
.
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
I
was
frightened
;
but
I
certainly
kept
as
still
as
if
there
*NL*
had
been
something
dangerous
in
the
room
,
that
at
the
first
hint
of
a
*NL*
movement
on
my
part
would
be
provoked
to
pounce
upon
me
.
There
was
not
*NL*
much
in
the
room
--
you
know
how
these
bedrooms
are
--
a
sort
of
four-poster
*NL*
bedstead
under
a
mosquito-net
,
two
or
three
chairs
,
the
table
I
was
*NL*
writing
at
,
a
bare
floor
.
A
glass
door
opened
on
an
upstairs
verandah
,
*NL*
and
he
stood
with
his
face
to
it
,
having
a
hard
time
with
all
possible
*NL*
privacy
.
Dusk
fell
;
I
lit
a
candle
with
the
greatest
economy
of
movement
*NL*
and
as
much
prudence
as
though
it
were
an
illegal
proceeding
.
There
is
*NL*
no
doubt
that
he
had
a
very
hard
time
of
it
,
and
so
had
I
,
even
to
the
*NL*
point
,
I
must
own
,
of
wishing
him
to
the
devil
,
or
on
Walpole
Reef
at
*NL*
least
.
It
occurred
to
me
once
or
twice
that
,
after
all
,
Chester
was
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
the
man
to
deal
effectively
with
such
a
disaster
.
That
strange
*NL*
idealist
had
found
a
practical
use
for
it
at
once
--
unerringly
,
as
it
*NL*
were
.
It
was
enough
to
make
one
suspect
that
,
maybe
,
he
really
could
see
*NL*
the
true
aspect
of
things
that
appeared
mysterious
or
utterly
hopeless
*NL*
to
less
imaginative
persons
.
I
wrote
and
wrote
;
I
liquidated
all
the
*NL*
arrears
of
my
correspondence
,
and
then
went
on
writing
to
people
who
had
*NL*
no
reason
whatever
to
expect
from
me
a
gossipy
letter
about
nothing
at
*NL*
all
.
At
times
I
stole
a
sidelong
glance
.
He
was
rooted
to
the
spot
,
*NL*
but
convulsive
shudders
ran
down
his
back
;
his
shoulders
would
heave
*NL*
suddenly
.
He
was
fighting
,
he
was
fighting
--
mostly
for
his
breath
,
as
it
*NL*
seemed
.
The
massive
shadows
,
cast
all
one
way
from
the
straight
flame
of
*NL*
the
candle
,
seemed
possessed
of
gloomy
consciousness
;
the
immobility
of
*NL*
the
furniture
had
to
my
furtive
eye
an
air
of
attention
.
I
was
becoming
*NL*
fanciful
in
the
midst
of
my
industrious
scribbling
;
and
though
,
when
the
*NL*
scratching
of
my
pen
stopped
for
a
moment
,
there
was
complete
silence
*NL*
and
stillness
in
the
room
,
I
suffered
from
that
profound
disturbance
*NL*
and
confusion
of
thought
which
is
caused
by
a
violent
and
menacing
*NL*
uproar
--
of
a
heavy
gale
at
sea
,
for
instance
.
Some
of
you
may
know
what
*NL*
I
mean
:
that
mingled
anxiety
,
distress
,
and
irritation
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
craven
feeling
creeping
in
--
not
pleasant
to
acknowledge
,
but
which
gives
*NL*
a
quite
special
merit
to
one
's
endurance
.
I
do
n't
claim
any
merit
*NL*
for
standing
the
stress
of
Jim
's
emotions
;
I
could
take
refuge
in
the
*NL*
letters
;
I
could
have
written
to
strangers
if
necessary
.
Suddenly
,
as
I
*NL*
was
taking
up
a
fresh
sheet
of
notepaper
,
I
heard
a
low
sound
,
the
first
*NL*
sound
that
,
since
we
had
been
shut
up
together
,
had
come
to
my
ears
in
*NL*
the
dim
stillness
of
the
room
.
I
remained
with
my
head
down
,
with
my
*NL*
hand
arrested
.
Those
who
have
kept
vigil
by
a
sick-bed
have
heard
such
*NL*
faint
sounds
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
watches
,
sounds
wrung
from
a
*NL*
racked
body
,
from
a
weary
soul
.
He
pushed
the
glass
door
with
such
force
*NL*
that
all
the
panes
rang
:
he
stepped
out
,
and
I
held
my
breath
,
straining
*NL*
my
ears
without
knowing
what
else
I
expected
to
hear
.
He
was
really
*NL*
taking
too
much
to
heart
an
empty
formality
which
to
Chester
's
rigorous
*NL*
criticism
seemed
unworthy
the
notice
of
a
man
who
could
see
things
as
*NL*
they
were
.
An
empty
formality
;
a
piece
of
parchment
.
Well
,
well
.
As
to
*NL*
an
inaccessible
guano
deposit
,
that
was
another
story
altogether
.
One
*NL*
could
intelligibly
break
one
's
heart
over
that
.
A
feeble
burst
of
many
*NL*
voices
mingled
with
the
tinkle
of
silver
and
glass
floated
up
from
the
*NL*
dining-room
below
;
through
the
open
door
the
outer
edge
of
the
light
*NL*
from
my
candle
fell
on
his
back
faintly
;
beyond
all
was
black
;
he
stood
*NL*
on
the
brink
of
a
vast
obscurity
,
like
a
lonely
figure
by
the
shore
of
*NL*
a
sombre
and
hopeless
ocean
.
There
was
the
Walpole
Reef
in
it
--
to
*NL*
be
sure
--
a
speck
in
the
dark
void
,
a
straw
for
the
drowning
man
.
My
*NL*
compassion
for
him
took
the
shape
of
the
thought
that
I
would
n't
have
*NL*
liked
his
people
to
see
him
at
that
moment
.
I
found
it
trying
myself
.
*NL*
His
back
was
no
longer
shaken
by
his
gasps
;
he
stood
straight
as
an
*NL*
arrow
,
faintly
visible
and
still
;
and
the
meaning
of
this
stillness
sank
*NL*
to
the
bottom
of
my
soul
like
lead
into
the
water
,
and
made
it
so
heavy
*NL*
that
for
a
second
I
wished
heartily
that
the
only
course
left
open
for
*NL*
me
was
to
pay
for
his
funeral
.
Even
the
law
had
done
with
him
.
To
bury
*NL*
him
would
have
been
such
an
easy
kindness
!
It
would
have
been
so
much
*NL*
in
accordance
with
the
wisdom
of
life
,
which
consists
in
putting
out
of
*NL*
sight
all
the
reminders
of
our
folly
,
of
our
weakness
,
of
our
mortality
;
*NL*
all
that
makes
against
our
efficiency
--
the
memory
of
our
failures
,
the
*NL*
hints
of
our
undying
fears
,
the
bodies
of
our
dead
friends
.
Perhaps
he
*NL*
did
take
it
too
much
to
heart
.
And
if
so
then
--
Chester
's
offer
...
At
*NL*
this
point
I
took
up
a
fresh
sheet
and
began
to
write
resolutely
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
but
myself
between
him
and
the
dark
ocean
.
I
had
a
sense
of
*NL*
responsibility
.
If
I
spoke
,
would
that
motionless
and
suffering
youth
*NL*
leap
into
the
obscurity
--
clutch
at
the
straw
?
I
found
out
how
difficult
*NL*
it
may
be
sometimes
to
make
a
sound
.
There
is
a
weird
power
in
a
spoken
*NL*
word
.
And
why
the
devil
not
?
I
was
asking
myself
persistently
while
I
*NL*
drove
on
with
my
writing
.
All
at
once
,
on
the
blank
page
,
under
the
very
*NL*
point
of
the
pen
,
the
two
figures
of
Chester
and
his
antique
partner
,
*NL*
very
distinct
and
complete
,
would
dodge
into
view
with
stride
and
*NL*
gestures
,
as
if
reproduced
in
the
field
of
some
optical
toy
.
I
would
*NL*
watch
them
for
a
while
.
No
!
They
were
too
phantasmal
and
extravagant
*NL*
to
enter
into
any
one
's
fate
.
And
a
word
carries
far
--
very
far
--
deals
*NL*
destruction
through
time
as
the
bullets
go
flying
through
space
.
I
said
*NL*
nothing
;
and
he
,
out
there
with
his
back
to
the
light
,
as
if
bound
*NL*
and
gagged
by
all
the
invisible
foes
of
man
,
made
no
stir
and
made
no
*NL*
sound
.

CHAPTER
16
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
time
was
coming
when
I
should
see
him
loved
,
trusted
,
admired
,
with
*NL*
a
legend
of
strength
and
prowess
forming
round
his
name
as
though
he
*NL*
had
been
the
stuff
of
a
hero
.
It
's
true
--
I
assure
you
;
as
true
as
*NL*
I
'm
sitting
here
talking
about
him
in
vain
.
He
,
on
his
side
,
had
that
*NL*
faculty
of
beholding
at
a
hint
the
face
of
his
desire
and
the
shape
*NL*
of
his
dream
,
without
which
the
earth
would
know
no
lover
and
no
*NL*
adventurer
.
He
captured
much
honour
and
an
Arcadian
happiness
-LRB-
I
wo
n't
*NL*
say
anything
about
innocence
-RRB-
in
the
bush
,
and
it
was
as
good
to
him
*NL*
as
the
honour
and
the
Arcadian
happiness
of
the
streets
to
another
man
.
*NL*
Felicity
,
felicity
--
how
shall
I
say
it
?
--
is
quaffed
out
of
a
golden
cup
*NL*
in
every
latitude
:
the
flavour
is
with
you
--
with
you
alone
,
and
you
can
*NL*
make
it
as
intoxicating
as
you
please
.
He
was
of
the
sort
that
would
*NL*
drink
deep
,
as
you
may
guess
from
what
went
before
.
I
found
him
,
if
not
*NL*
exactly
intoxicated
,
then
at
least
flushed
with
the
elixir
at
his
lips
.
*NL*
He
had
not
obtained
it
at
once
.
There
had
been
,
as
you
know
,
a
period
of
*NL*
probation
amongst
infernal
ship-chandlers
,
during
which
he
had
suffered
*NL*
and
I
had
worried
about
--
about
--
my
trust
--
you
may
call
it
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
that
I
am
completely
reassured
now
,
after
beholding
him
in
all
his
*NL*
brilliance
.
That
was
my
last
view
of
him
--
in
a
strong
light
,
dominating
,
*NL*
and
yet
in
complete
accord
with
his
surroundings
--
with
the
life
of
the
*NL*
forests
and
with
the
life
of
men
.
I
own
that
I
was
impressed
,
but
I
must
*NL*
admit
to
myself
that
after
all
this
is
not
the
lasting
impression
.
He
*NL*
was
protected
by
his
isolation
,
alone
of
his
own
superior
kind
,
in
close
*NL*
touch
with
Nature
,
that
keeps
faith
on
such
easy
terms
with
her
lovers
.
*NL*
But
I
can
not
fix
before
my
eye
the
image
of
his
safety
.
I
shall
always
*NL*
remember
him
as
seen
through
the
open
door
of
my
room
,
taking
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
too
much
to
heart
the
mere
consequences
of
his
failure
.
I
am
pleased
,
*NL*
of
course
,
that
some
good
--
and
even
some
splendour
--
came
out
of
my
*NL*
endeavours
;
but
at
times
it
seems
to
me
it
would
have
been
better
for
my
*NL*
peace
of
mind
if
I
had
not
stood
between
him
and
Chester
's
confoundedly
*NL*
generous
offer
.
I
wonder
what
his
exuberant
imagination
would
have
made
*NL*
of
Walpole
islet
--
that
most
hopelessly
forsaken
crumb
of
dry
land
on
the
*NL*
face
of
the
waters
.
It
is
not
likely
I
would
ever
have
heard
,
for
I
must
*NL*
tell
you
that
Chester
,
after
calling
at
some
Australian
port
to
patch
*NL*
up
his
brig-rigged
sea-anachronism
,
steamed
out
into
the
Pacific
with
a
*NL*
crew
of
twenty-two
hands
all
told
,
and
the
only
news
having
a
possible
*NL*
bearing
upon
the
mystery
of
his
fate
was
the
news
of
a
hurricane
which
*NL*
is
supposed
to
have
swept
in
its
course
over
the
Walpole
shoals
,
a
month
*NL*
or
so
afterwards
.
Not
a
vestige
of
the
Argonauts
ever
turned
up
;
not
a
*NL*
sound
came
out
of
the
waste
.
Finis
!
The
Pacific
is
the
most
discreet
of
*NL*
live
,
hot-tempered
oceans
:
the
chilly
Antarctic
can
keep
a
secret
too
,
*NL*
but
more
in
the
manner
of
a
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
there
is
a
sense
of
blessed
finality
in
such
discretion
,
which
is
*NL*
what
we
all
more
or
less
sincerely
are
ready
to
admit
--
for
what
else
is
*NL*
it
that
makes
the
idea
of
death
supportable
?
End
!
Finis
!
the
potent
word
*NL*
that
exorcises
from
the
house
of
life
the
haunting
shadow
of
fate
.
This
*NL*
is
what
--
notwithstanding
the
testimony
of
my
eyes
and
his
own
earnest
*NL*
assurances
--
I
miss
when
I
look
back
upon
Jim
's
success
.
While
there
's
*NL*
life
there
is
hope
,
truly
;
but
there
is
fear
too
.
I
do
n't
mean
to
say
*NL*
that
I
regret
my
action
,
nor
will
I
pretend
that
I
ca
n't
sleep
o
'
nights
*NL*
in
consequence
;
still
,
the
idea
obtrudes
itself
that
he
made
so
much
of
*NL*
his
disgrace
while
it
is
the
guilt
alone
that
matters
.
He
was
not
--
if
I
*NL*
may
say
so
--
clear
to
me
.
He
was
not
clear
.
And
there
is
a
suspicion
he
*NL*
was
not
clear
to
himself
either
.
There
were
his
fine
sensibilities
,
*NL*
his
fine
feelings
,
his
fine
longings
--
a
sort
of
sublimated
,
idealised
*NL*
selfishness
.
He
was
--
if
you
allow
me
to
say
so
--
very
fine
;
very
*NL*
fine
--
and
very
unfortunate
.
A
little
coarser
nature
would
not
have
borne
*NL*
the
strain
;
it
would
have
had
to
come
to
terms
with
itself
--
with
a
sigh
,
*NL*
with
a
grunt
,
or
even
with
a
guffaw
;
a
still
coarser
one
would
have
*NL*
remained
invulnerably
ignorant
and
completely
uninteresting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
he
was
too
interesting
or
too
unfortunate
to
be
thrown
to
the
dogs
,
*NL*
or
even
to
Chester
.
I
felt
this
while
I
sat
with
my
face
over
the
paper
*NL*
and
he
fought
and
gasped
,
struggling
for
his
breath
in
that
terribly
*NL*
stealthy
way
,
in
my
room
;
I
felt
it
when
he
rushed
out
on
the
verandah
*NL*
as
if
to
fling
himself
over
--
and
did
n't
;
I
felt
it
more
and
more
all
the
*NL*
time
he
remained
outside
,
faintly
lighted
on
the
background
of
night
,
as
*NL*
if
standing
on
the
shore
of
a
sombre
and
hopeless
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
An
abrupt
heavy
rumble
made
me
lift
my
head
.
The
noise
seemed
to
roll
*NL*
away
,
and
suddenly
a
searching
and
violent
glare
fell
on
the
blind
face
*NL*
of
the
night
.
The
sustained
and
dazzling
flickers
seemed
to
last
for
an
*NL*
unconscionable
time
.
The
growl
of
the
thunder
increased
steadily
while
I
*NL*
looked
at
him
,
distinct
and
black
,
planted
solidly
upon
the
shores
of
a
*NL*
sea
of
light
.
At
the
moment
of
greatest
brilliance
the
darkness
leaped
*NL*
back
with
a
culminating
crash
,
and
he
vanished
before
my
dazzled
eyes
as
*NL*
utterly
as
though
he
had
been
blown
to
atoms
.
A
blustering
sigh
passed
;
*NL*
furious
hands
seemed
to
tear
at
the
shrubs
,
shake
the
tops
of
the
*NL*
trees
below
,
slam
doors
,
break
window-panes
,
all
along
the
front
of
*NL*
the
building
.
He
stepped
in
,
closing
the
door
behind
him
,
and
found
me
*NL*
bending
over
the
table
:
my
sudden
anxiety
as
to
what
he
would
say
was
*NL*
very
great
,
and
akin
to
a
fright
.
``
May
I
have
a
cigarette
?
''
he
asked
.
I
*NL*
gave
a
push
to
the
box
without
raising
my
head
.
``
I
want
--
want
--
tobacco
,
''
*NL*
he
muttered
.
I
became
extremely
buoyant
.
``
Just
a
moment
.
''
I
grunted
*NL*
pleasantly
.
He
took
a
few
steps
here
and
there
.
``
That
's
over
,
''
I
heard
*NL*
him
say
.
A
single
distant
clap
of
thunder
came
from
the
sea
like
a
*NL*
gun
of
distress
.
``
The
monsoon
breaks
up
early
this
year
,
''
he
remarked
*NL*
conversationally
,
somewhere
behind
me
.
This
encouraged
me
to
turn
round
,
*NL*
which
I
did
as
soon
as
I
had
finished
addressing
the
last
envelope
.
He
*NL*
was
smoking
greedily
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
and
though
he
heard
the
*NL*
stir
I
made
,
he
remained
with
his
back
to
me
for
a
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Come
--
I
carried
it
off
pretty
well
,
''
he
said
,
wheeling
suddenly
.
*NL*
``
Something
's
paid
off
--
not
much
.
I
wonder
what
's
to
come
.
''
His
face
did
*NL*
not
show
any
emotion
,
only
it
appeared
a
little
darkened
and
swollen
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
been
holding
his
breath
.
He
smiled
reluctantly
as
it
*NL*
were
,
and
went
on
while
I
gazed
up
at
him
mutely
...
``
Thank
you
,
*NL*
though
--
your
room
--
jolly
convenient
--
for
a
chap
--
badly
hipped
.
''
...
*NL*
The
rain
pattered
and
swished
in
the
garden
;
a
water-pipe
-LRB-
it
must
*NL*
have
had
a
hole
in
it
-RRB-
performed
just
outside
the
window
a
parody
of
*NL*
blubbering
woe
with
funny
sobs
and
gurgling
lamentations
,
interrupted
*NL*
by
jerky
spasms
of
silence
...
``
A
bit
of
shelter
,
''
he
mumbled
and
*NL*
ceased
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
flash
of
faded
lightning
darted
in
through
the
black
framework
of
the
*NL*
windows
and
ebbed
out
without
any
noise
.
I
was
thinking
how
I
had
best
*NL*
approach
him
-LRB-
I
did
not
want
to
be
flung
off
again
-RRB-
when
he
gave
a
*NL*
little
laugh
.
``
No
better
than
a
vagabond
now
''
...
the
end
of
*NL*
the
cigarette
smouldered
between
his
fingers
...
``
without
a
*NL*
single
--
single
,
''
he
pronounced
slowly
;
``
and
yet
...
''
He
paused
;
the
*NL*
rain
fell
with
redoubled
violence
.
``
Some
day
one
's
bound
to
come
upon
*NL*
some
sort
of
chance
to
get
it
all
back
again
.
Must
!
''
he
whispered
*NL*
distinctly
,
glaring
at
my
boots
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
even
know
what
it
was
he
wished
so
much
to
regain
,
what
it
*NL*
was
he
had
so
terribly
missed
.
It
might
have
been
so
much
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
to
say
.
A
piece
of
ass
's
skin
,
according
to
Chester
...
*NL*
He
looked
up
at
me
inquisitively
.
``
Perhaps
.
If
life
's
long
enough
,
''
I
*NL*
muttered
through
my
teeth
with
unreasonable
animosity
.
``
Do
n't
reckon
too
*NL*
much
on
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Jove
!
I
feel
as
if
nothing
could
ever
touch
me
,
''
he
said
in
a
tone
*NL*
of
sombre
conviction
.
``
If
this
business
could
n't
knock
me
over
,
then
*NL*
there
's
no
fear
of
there
being
not
enough
time
to
--
climb
out
,
and
...
''
*NL*
He
looked
upwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
struck
me
that
it
is
from
such
as
he
that
the
great
army
of
waifs
*NL*
and
strays
is
recruited
,
the
army
that
marches
down
,
down
into
all
the
*NL*
gutters
of
the
earth
.
As
soon
as
he
left
my
room
,
that
``
bit
of
shelter
,
''
*NL*
he
would
take
his
place
in
the
ranks
,
and
begin
the
journey
towards
the
*NL*
bottomless
pit
.
I
at
least
had
no
illusions
;
but
it
was
I
,
too
,
who
a
*NL*
moment
ago
had
been
so
sure
of
the
power
of
words
,
and
now
was
afraid
to
*NL*
speak
,
in
the
same
way
one
dares
not
move
for
fear
of
losing
a
slippery
*NL*
hold
.
It
is
when
we
try
to
grapple
with
another
man
's
intimate
need
that
*NL*
we
perceive
how
incomprehensible
,
wavering
,
and
misty
are
the
beings
*NL*
that
share
with
us
the
sight
of
the
stars
and
the
warmth
of
the
sun
.
It
*NL*
is
as
if
loneliness
were
a
hard
and
absolute
condition
of
existence
;
the
*NL*
envelope
of
flesh
and
blood
on
which
our
eyes
are
fixed
melts
before
the
*NL*
outstretched
hand
,
and
there
remains
only
the
capricious
,
unconsolable
,
*NL*
and
elusive
spirit
that
no
eye
can
follow
,
no
hand
can
grasp
.
It
was
*NL*
the
fear
of
losing
him
that
kept
me
silent
,
for
it
was
borne
upon
me
*NL*
suddenly
and
with
unaccountable
force
that
should
I
let
him
slip
away
*NL*
into
the
darkness
I
would
never
forgive
myself
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Well

Uncommonly

I
do

sure

I
am
afraid

I
do

feel
as
grateful
as
I
would
if
the
whole
thing
had
n't
been
so
*NL*
brutally
sprung
on
me

yourself

He
*NL*
stuttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Possibly

I
struck
in
.
He
frowned
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
All
the

responsible

He
watched
me
like
a
hawk
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
that
's
true
,
too
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Well

I
've
gone
with
it
to
the

and
I
do

to
let
any

*NL*
cast
it
in
my
teeth
without

without

resenting
it

He
clenched
his
*NL*
fist
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
There
's
yourself
,
''
I
said
with
a
smile
--
mirthless
enough
,
God
*NL*
knows
--
but
he
looked
at
me
menacingly
.
``
That
's
my
business
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
An
air
of
indomitable
resolution
came
and
went
upon
his
face
like
a
vain
*NL*
and
passing
shadow
.
Next
moment
he
looked
a
dear
good
boy
in
trouble
,
*NL*
as
before
.
He
flung
away
the
cigarette
.
``
Good-bye
,
''
he
said
,
with
the
*NL*
sudden
haste
of
a
man
who
had
lingered
too
long
in
view
of
a
pressing
*NL*
bit
of
work
waiting
for
him
;
and
then
for
a
second
or
so
he
made
not
the
*NL*
slightest
movement
.
The
downpour
fell
with
the
heavy
uninterrupted
rush
*NL*
of
a
sweeping
flood
,
with
a
sound
of
unchecked
overwhelming
fury
that
*NL*
called
to
one
's
mind
the
images
of
collapsing
bridges
,
of
uprooted
*NL*
trees
,
of
undermined
mountains
.
No
man
could
breast
the
colossal
and
*NL*
headlong
stream
that
seemed
to
break
and
swirl
against
the
dim
stillness
*NL*
in
which
we
were
precariously
sheltered
as
if
on
an
island
.
The
*NL*
perforated
pipe
gurgled
,
choked
,
spat
,
and
splashed
in
odious
ridicule
*NL*
of
a
swimmer
fighting
for
his
life
.
``
It
is
raining
,
''
I
remonstrated
,
*NL*
``
and
I
...
''
``
Rain
or
shine
,
''
he
began
brusquely
,
checked
himself
,
and
*NL*
walked
to
the
window
.
``
Perfect
deluge
,
''
he
muttered
after
a
while
:
he
*NL*
leaned
his
forehead
on
the
glass
.
``
It
's
dark
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Yes
,
it
is
very
dark
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
pivoted
on
his
heels
,
crossed
the
room
,
and
had
actually
opened
the
*NL*
door
leading
into
the
corridor
before
I
leaped
up
from
my
chair
.
``
Wait
,
''
*NL*
I
cried
,
``
I
want
you
to
...
''
``
I
ca
n't
dine
with
you
again
to-night
,
''
*NL*
he
flung
at
me
,
with
one
leg
out
of
the
room
already
.
``
I
have
n't
the
*NL*
slightest
intention
to
ask
you
,
''
I
shouted
.
At
this
he
drew
back
his
*NL*
foot
,
but
remained
mistrustfully
in
the
very
doorway
.
I
lost
no
time
*NL*
in
entreating
him
earnestly
not
to
be
absurd
;
to
come
in
and
shut
the
*NL*
door
.

CHAPTER
17
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
came
in
at
last
;
but
I
believe
it
was
mostly
the
rain
that
did
it
;
*NL*
it
was
falling
just
then
with
a
devastating
violence
which
quieted
*NL*
down
gradually
while
we
talked
.
His
manner
was
very
sober
and
set
;
his
*NL*
bearing
was
that
of
a
naturally
taciturn
man
possessed
by
an
idea
.
My
*NL*
talk
was
of
the
material
aspect
of
his
position
;
it
had
the
sole
aim
of
*NL*
saving
him
from
the
degradation
,
ruin
,
and
despair
that
out
there
close
*NL*
so
swiftly
upon
a
friendless
,
homeless
man
;
I
pleaded
with
him
to
*NL*
accept
my
help
;
I
argued
reasonably
:
and
every
time
I
looked
up
at
that
*NL*
absorbed
smooth
face
,
so
grave
and
youthful
,
I
had
a
disturbing
sense
of
*NL*
being
no
help
but
rather
an
obstacle
to
some
mysterious
,
inexplicable
,
*NL*
impalpable
striving
of
his
wounded
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
suppose
you
intend
to
eat
and
drink
and
to
sleep
under
shelter
in
*NL*
the
usual
way
,
''
I
remember
saying
with
irritation
.
``
You
say
you
wo
n't
*NL*
touch
the
money
that
is
due
to
you
.
''
...
He
came
as
near
as
his
sort
*NL*
can
to
making
a
gesture
of
horror
.
-LRB-
There
were
three
weeks
and
five
*NL*
days
'
pay
owing
him
as
mate
of
the
Patna
.
-RRB-
``
Well
,
that
's
too
little
to
*NL*
matter
anyhow
;
but
what
will
you
do
to-morrow
?
Where
will
you
turn
?
You
*NL*
must
live
...
''
``
That
is
n't
the
thing
,
''
was
the
comment
that
escaped
*NL*
him
under
his
breath
.
I
ignored
it
,
and
went
on
combating
what
I
assumed
*NL*
to
be
the
scruples
of
an
exaggerated
delicacy
.
``
On
every
conceivable
*NL*
ground
,
''
I
concluded
,
``
you
must
let
me
help
you
.
''
``
You
ca
n't
,
''
he
said
*NL*
very
simply
and
gently
,
and
holding
fast
to
some
deep
idea
which
I
*NL*
could
detect
shimmering
like
a
pool
of
water
in
the
dark
,
but
which
*NL*
I
despaired
of
ever
approaching
near
enough
to
fathom
.
I
surveyed
his
*NL*
well-proportioned
bulk
.
``
At
any
rate
,
''
I
said
,
``
I
am
able
to
help
what
*NL*
I
can
see
of
you
.
I
do
n't
pretend
to
do
more
.
''
He
shook
his
head
*NL*
sceptically
without
looking
at
me
.
I
got
very
warm
.
``
But
I
can
,
''
I
*NL*
insisted
.
``
I
can
do
even
more
.
I
_
am
_
doing
more
.
I
am
trusting
*NL*
you
...
''
``
The
money
...
''
he
began
.
``
Upon
my
word
you
deserve
being
*NL*
told
to
go
to
the
devil
,
''
I
cried
,
forcing
the
note
of
indignation
.
He
*NL*
was
startled
,
smiled
,
and
I
pressed
my
attack
home
.
``
It
is
n't
a
question
*NL*
of
money
at
all
.
You
are
too
superficial
,
''
I
said
-LRB-
and
at
the
same
time
*NL*
I
was
thinking
to
myself
:
Well
,
here
goes
!
And
perhaps
he
is
,
after
*NL*
all
-RRB-
.
``
Look
at
the
letter
I
want
you
to
take
.
I
am
writing
to
a
man
of
*NL*
whom
I
've
never
asked
a
favour
,
and
I
am
writing
about
you
in
terms
that
*NL*
one
only
ventures
to
use
when
speaking
of
an
intimate
friend
.
I
make
*NL*
myself
unreservedly
responsible
for
you
.
That
's
what
I
am
doing
.
And
*NL*
really
if
you
will
only
reflect
a
little
what
that
means
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
lifted
his
head
.
The
rain
had
passed
away
;
only
the
water-pipe
went
*NL*
on
shedding
tears
with
an
absurd
drip
,
drip
outside
the
window
.
It
was
*NL*
very
quiet
in
the
room
,
whose
shadows
huddled
together
in
corners
,
away
*NL*
from
the
still
flame
of
the
candle
flaring
upright
in
the
shape
of
a
*NL*
dagger
;
his
face
after
a
while
seemed
suffused
by
a
reflection
of
a
soft
*NL*
light
as
if
the
dawn
had
broken
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Jove
!
''
he
gasped
out
.
``
It
is
noble
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Had
he
suddenly
put
out
his
tongue
at
me
in
derision
,
I
could
not
have
*NL*
felt
more
humiliated
.
I
thought
to
myself
--
Serve
me
right
for
a
sneaking
*NL*
humbug
...
His
eyes
shone
straight
into
my
face
,
but
I
perceived
*NL*
it
was
not
a
mocking
brightness
.
All
at
once
he
sprang
into
jerky
*NL*
agitation
,
like
one
of
those
flat
wooden
figures
that
are
worked
by
a
*NL*
string
.
His
arms
went
up
,
then
came
down
with
a
slap
.
He
became
another
*NL*
man
altogether
.
``
And
I
had
never
seen
,
''
he
shouted
;
then
suddenly
bit
*NL*
his
lip
and
frowned
.
``
What
a
bally
ass
I
've
been
,
''
he
said
very
slow
*NL*
in
an
awed
tone
...
``
You
are
a
brick
!
''
he
cried
next
in
a
muffled
*NL*
voice
.
He
snatched
my
hand
as
though
he
had
just
then
seen
it
for
the
*NL*
first
time
,
and
dropped
it
at
once
.
``
Why
!
this
is
what
I
--
you
--
I
...
''
*NL*
he
stammered
,
and
then
with
a
return
of
his
old
stolid
,
I
may
say
*NL*
mulish
,
manner
he
began
heavily
,
``
I
would
be
a
brute
now
if
I
...
''
and
*NL*
then
his
voice
seemed
to
break
.
``
That
's
all
right
,
''
I
said
.
I
was
almost
*NL*
alarmed
by
this
display
of
feeling
,
through
which
pierced
a
strange
*NL*
elation
.
I
had
pulled
the
string
accidentally
,
as
it
were
;
I
did
not
*NL*
fully
understand
the
working
of
the
toy
.
``
I
must
go
now
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
``
Jove
!
You
_
have
_
helped
me
.
Ca
n't
sit
still
.
The
very
thing
...
''
He
*NL*
looked
at
me
with
puzzled
admiration
.
``
The
very
thing
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
it
was
the
thing
.
It
was
ten
to
one
that
I
had
saved
him
from
*NL*
starvation
--
of
that
peculiar
sort
that
is
almost
invariably
associated
*NL*
with
drink
.
This
was
all
.
I
had
not
a
single
illusion
on
that
score
,
but
*NL*
looking
at
him
,
I
allowed
myself
to
wonder
at
the
nature
of
the
one
he
*NL*
had
,
within
the
last
three
minutes
,
so
evidently
taken
into
his
bosom
.
*NL*
I
had
forced
into
his
hand
the
means
to
carry
on
decently
the
serious
*NL*
business
of
life
,
to
get
food
,
drink
,
and
shelter
of
the
customary
kind
*NL*
while
his
wounded
spirit
,
like
a
bird
with
a
broken
wing
,
might
hop
and
*NL*
flutter
into
some
hole
to
die
quietly
of
inanition
there
.
This
is
what
*NL*
I
had
thrust
upon
him
:
a
definitely
small
thing
;
and
--
behold
!
--
by
the
*NL*
manner
of
its
reception
it
loomed
in
the
dim
light
of
the
candle
like
*NL*
a
big
,
indistinct
,
perhaps
a
dangerous
shadow
.
``
You
do
n't
mind
me
not
*NL*
saying
anything
appropriate
,
''
he
burst
out
.
``
There
is
n't
anything
one
*NL*
could
say
.
Last
night
already
you
had
done
me
no
end
of
good
.
Listening
*NL*
to
me
--
you
know
.
I
give
you
my
word
I
've
thought
more
than
once
the
top
*NL*
of
my
head
would
fly
off
...
''
He
darted
--
positively
darted
--
here
and
*NL*
there
,
rammed
his
hands
into
his
pockets
,
jerked
them
out
again
,
flung
*NL*
his
cap
on
his
head
.
I
had
no
idea
it
was
in
him
to
be
so
airily
*NL*
brisk
.
I
thought
of
a
dry
leaf
imprisoned
in
an
eddy
of
wind
,
while
a
*NL*
mysterious
apprehension
,
a
load
of
indefinite
doubt
,
weighed
me
down
in
*NL*
my
chair
.
He
stood
stock-still
,
as
if
struck
motionless
by
a
discovery
.
*NL*
``
You
have
given
me
confidence
,
''
he
declared
,
soberly
.
``
Oh
!
for
God
's
*NL*
sake
,
my
dear
fellow
--
do
n't
!
''
I
entreated
,
as
though
he
had
hurt
me
.
*NL*
``
All
right
.
I
'll
shut
up
now
and
henceforth
.
Ca
n't
prevent
me
thinking
*NL*
though
...
Never
mind
!
...
I
'll
show
yet
...
''
He
went
to
the
*NL*
door
in
a
hurry
,
paused
with
his
head
down
,
and
came
back
,
stepping
*NL*
deliberately
.
``
I
always
thought
that
if
a
fellow
could
begin
with
a
*NL*
clean
slate
...
And
now
you
...
in
a
measure
...
yes
...
clean
*NL*
slate
.
''
I
waved
my
hand
,
and
he
marched
out
without
looking
back
;
the
*NL*
sound
of
his
footfalls
died
out
gradually
behind
the
closed
door
--
the
*NL*
unhesitating
tread
of
a
man
walking
in
broad
daylight
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
as
to
me
,
left
alone
with
the
solitary
candle
,
I
remained
strangely
*NL*
unenlightened
.
I
was
no
longer
young
enough
to
behold
at
every
turn
*NL*
the
magnificence
that
besets
our
insignificant
footsteps
in
good
and
in
*NL*
evil
.
I
smiled
to
think
that
,
after
all
,
it
was
yet
he
,
of
us
two
,
who
*NL*
had
the
light
.
And
I
felt
sad
.
A
clean
slate
,
did
he
say
?
As
if
the
*NL*
initial
word
of
each
our
destiny
were
not
graven
in
imperishable
*NL*
characters
upon
the
face
of
a
rock

Six
months
afterwards

more
than

middle-aged
bachelor
,
with
a
reputation

wrote
to

judging
,
from

warmth

my

recommendation
,
that
I
would
like

enlarged
a
little
upon

perfections

These
were
apparently
of
a
quiet

effective
sort

that
even
in
this
steaming
climate
could
be
considered
as
too
*NL*
big
for
one
man
.
I
have
had
him
to
live
with
me
for
some
time
past
.
It
*NL*
seems
I
have
n't
made
a
mistake
.
''
It
seemed
to
me
on
reading
this
letter
*NL*
that
my
friend
had
found
in
his
heart
more
than
tolerance
for
Jim
--
that
*NL*
there
were
the
beginnings
of
active
liking
.
Of
course
he
stated
his
*NL*
grounds
in
a
characteristic
way
.
For
one
thing
,
Jim
kept
his
freshness
*NL*
in
the
climate
.
Had
he
been
a
girl
--
my
friend
wrote
--
one
could
have
*NL*
said
he
was
blooming
--
blooming
modestly
--
like
a
violet
,
not
like
some
of
*NL*
these
blatant
tropical
flowers
.
He
had
been
in
the
house
for
six
weeks
,
*NL*
and
had
not
as
yet
attempted
to
slap
him
on
the
back
,
or
address
him
*NL*
as
``
old
boy
,
''
or
try
to
make
him
feel
a
superannuated
fossil
.
He
had
*NL*
nothing
of
the
exasperating
young
man
's
chatter
.
He
was
good-tempered
,
*NL*
had
not
much
to
say
for
himself
,
was
not
clever
by
any
means
,
thank
*NL*
goodness
--
wrote
my
friend
.
It
appeared
,
however
,
that
Jim
was
clever
*NL*
enough
to
be
quietly
appreciative
of
his
wit
,
while
,
on
the
other
hand
,
*NL*
he
amused
him
by
his
naiveness
.
``
The
dew
is
yet
on
him
,
and
since
I
*NL*
had
the
bright
idea
of
giving
him
a
room
in
the
house
and
having
him
*NL*
at
meals
I
feel
less
withered
myself
.
The
other
day
he
took
it
into
his
*NL*
head
to
cross
the
room
with
no
other
purpose
but
to
open
a
door
for
*NL*
me
;
and
I
felt
more
in
touch
with
mankind
than
I
had
been
for
years
.
*NL*
Ridiculous
,
is
n't
it
?
Of
course
I
guess
there
is
something
--
some
awful
*NL*
little
scrape
--
which
you
know
all
about
--
but
if
I
am
sure
that
it
is
*NL*
terribly
heinous
,
I
fancy
one
could
manage
to
forgive
it
.
For
my
part
,
*NL*
I
declare
I
am
unable
to
imagine
him
guilty
of
anything
much
worse
than
*NL*
robbing
an
orchard
.
Is
it
much
worse
?
Perhaps
you
ought
to
have
told
me
;
*NL*
but
it
is
such
a
long
time
since
we
both
turned
saints
that
you
may
have
*NL*
forgotten
we
,
too
,
had
sinned
in
our
time
?
It
may
be
that
some
day
I
*NL*
shall
have
to
ask
you
,
and
then
I
shall
expect
to
be
told
.
I
do
n't
care
*NL*
to
question
him
myself
till
I
have
some
idea
what
it
is
.
Moreover
,
it
's
*NL*
too
soon
as
yet
.
Let
him
open
the
door
a
few
times
more
for
me
...
''
*NL*
Thus
my
friend
.
I
was
trebly
pleased
--
at
Jim
's
shaping
so
well
,
at
the
*NL*
tone
of
the
letter
,
at
my
own
cleverness
.
Evidently
I
had
known
what
*NL*
I
was
doing
.
I
had
read
characters
aright
,
and
so
on
.
And
what
if
*NL*
something
unexpected
and
wonderful
were
to
come
of
it
?
That
evening
,
*NL*
reposing
in
a
deck-chair
under
the
shade
of
my
own
poop
awning
-LRB-
it
*NL*
was
in
Hong-Kong
harbour
-RRB-
,
I
laid
on
Jim
's
behalf
the
first
stone
of
a
*NL*
castle
in
Spain
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
made
a
trip
to
the
northward
,
and
when
I
returned
I
found
another
*NL*
letter
from
my
friend
waiting
for
me
.
It
was
the
first
envelope
I
tore
*NL*
open
.
``
There
are
no
spoons
missing
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
''
ran
the
first
*NL*
line
;
``
I
have
n't
been
interested
enough
to
inquire
.
He
is
gone
,
leaving
*NL*
on
the
breakfast-table
a
formal
little
note
of
apology
,
which
is
either
*NL*
silly
or
heartless
.
Probably
both
--
and
it
's
all
one
to
me
.
Allow
me
to
*NL*
say
,
lest
you
should
have
some
more
mysterious
young
men
in
reserve
,
*NL*
that
I
have
shut
up
shop
,
definitely
and
for
ever
.
This
is
the
last
*NL*
eccentricity
I
shall
be
guilty
of
.
Do
not
imagine
for
a
moment
that
I
*NL*
care
a
hang
;
but
he
is
very
much
regretted
at
tennis-parties
,
and
for
*NL*
my
own
sake
I
've
told
a
plausible
lie
at
the
club
...
''
I
flung
the
*NL*
letter
aside
and
started
looking
through
the
batch
on
my
table
,
till
*NL*
I
came
upon
Jim
's
handwriting
.
Would
you
believe
it
?
One
chance
in
a
*NL*
hundred
!
But
it
is
always
that
hundredth
chance
!
That
little
second
*NL*
engineer
of
the
Patna
had
turned
up
in
a
more
or
less
destitute
state
,
*NL*
and
got
a
temporary
job
of
looking
after
the
machinery
of
the
mill
.
``
I
*NL*
could
n't
stand
the
familiarity
of
the
little
beast
,
''
Jim
wrote
from
a
*NL*
seaport
seven
hundred
miles
south
of
the
place
where
he
should
have
been
*NL*
in
clover
.
``
I
am
now
for
the
time
with
Egstrom
&
Blake
,
ship-chandlers
,
*NL*
as
their
--
well
--
runner
,
to
call
the
thing
by
its
right
name
.
For
*NL*
reference
I
gave
them
your
name
,
which
they
know
of
course
,
and
if
you
*NL*
could
write
a
word
in
my
favour
it
would
be
a
permanent
employment
.
''
I
*NL*
was
utterly
crushed
under
the
ruins
of
my
castle
,
but
of
course
I
wrote
*NL*
as
desired
.
Before
the
end
of
the
year
my
new
charter
took
me
that
way
,
*NL*
and
I
had
an
opportunity
of
seeing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
was
still
with
Egstrom
&
Blake
,
and
we
met
in
what
they
called
*NL*
``
our
parlour
''
opening
out
of
the
store
.
He
had
that
moment
come
in
from
*NL*
boarding
a
ship
,
and
confronted
me
head
down
,
ready
for
a
tussle
.
``
What
*NL*
have
you
got
to
say
for
yourself
?
''
I
began
as
soon
as
we
had
shaken
*NL*
hands
.
``
What
I
wrote
you
--
nothing
more
,
''
he
said
stubbornly
.
``
Did
the
*NL*
fellow
blab
--
or
what
?
''
I
asked
.
He
looked
up
at
me
with
a
troubled
*NL*
smile
.
``
Oh
,
no
!
He
did
n't
.
He
made
it
a
kind
of
confidential
business
*NL*
between
us
.
He
was
most
damnably
mysterious
whenever
I
came
over
to
the
*NL*
mill
;
he
would
wink
at
me
in
a
respectful
manner
--
as
much
as
to
say
`
We
*NL*
know
what
we
know
.
'
Infernally
fawning
and
familiar
--
and
that
sort
of
*NL*
thing
...
''
He
threw
himself
into
a
chair
and
stared
down
his
legs
.
*NL*
``
One
day
we
happened
to
be
alone
and
the
fellow
had
the
cheek
to
say
,
*NL*
`
Well
,
Mr.
James
'
--
I
was
called
Mr.
James
there
as
if
I
had
been
the
*NL*
son
--
`
here
we
are
together
once
more
.
This
is
better
than
the
old
*NL*
ship
--
ai
n't
it
?
'
...
Was
n't
it
appalling
,
eh
?
I
looked
at
him
,
and
*NL*
he
put
on
a
knowing
air
.
`
Do
n't
you
be
uneasy
,
sir
,
'
he
says
.
'
I
know
*NL*
a
gentleman
when
I
see
one
,
and
I
know
how
a
gentleman
feels
.
I
hope
,
*NL*
though
,
you
will
be
keeping
me
on
this
job
.
I
had
a
hard
time
of
it
too
,
*NL*
along
of
that
rotten
old
Patna
racket
.
'
Jove
!
It
was
awful
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
I
should
have
said
or
done
if
I
had
not
just
then
heard
Mr.
Denver
*NL*
calling
me
in
the
passage
.
It
was
tiffin-time
,
and
we
walked
together
*NL*
across
the
yard
and
through
the
garden
to
the
bungalow
.
He
began
to
*NL*
chaff
me
in
his
kindly
way
...
I
believe
he
liked
me
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
was
silent
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
know
he
liked
me
.
That
's
what
made
it
so
hard
.
Such
a
splendid
man
!
*NL*
...
That
morning
he
slipped
his
hand
under
my
arm
...
He
,
too
,
was
*NL*
familiar
with
me
.
''
He
burst
into
a
short
laugh
,
and
dropped
his
chin
on
*NL*
his
breast
.
``
Pah
!
When
I
remembered
how
that
mean
little
beast
had
been
*NL*
talking
to
me
,
''
he
began
suddenly
in
a
vibrating
voice
,
``
I
could
n't
bear
*NL*
to
think
of
myself
...
I
suppose
you
know
...
''
I
nodded
...
``
More
*NL*
like
a
father
,
''
he
cried
;
his
voice
sank
.
``
I
would
have
had
to
tell
him
.
*NL*
I
could
n't
let
it
go
on
--
could
I
?
''
``
Well
?
''
I
murmured
,
after
waiting
a
*NL*
while
.
``
I
preferred
to
go
,
''
he
said
slowly
;
``
this
thing
must
be
buried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
could
hear
in
the
shop
Blake
upbraiding
Egstrom
in
an
abusive
,
*NL*
strained
voice
.
They
had
been
associated
for
many
years
,
and
every
day
*NL*
from
the
moment
the
doors
were
opened
to
the
last
minute
before
closing
,
*NL*
Blake
,
a
little
man
with
sleek
,
jetty
hair
and
unhappy
,
beady
eyes
,
*NL*
could
be
heard
rowing
his
partner
incessantly
with
a
sort
of
scathing
*NL*
and
plaintive
fury
.
The
sound
of
that
everlasting
scolding
was
part
of
*NL*
the
place
like
the
other
fixtures
;
even
strangers
would
very
soon
come
*NL*
to
disregard
it
completely
unless
it
be
perhaps
to
mutter
``
Nuisance
,
''
or
*NL*
to
get
up
suddenly
and
shut
the
door
of
the
``
parlour
.
''
Egstrom
himself
,
*NL*
a
raw-boned
,
heavy
Scandinavian
,
with
a
busy
manner
and
immense
blonde
*NL*
whiskers
,
went
on
directing
his
people
,
checking
parcels
,
making
out
*NL*
bills
or
writing
letters
at
a
stand-up
desk
in
the
shop
,
and
comported
*NL*
himself
in
that
clatter
exactly
as
though
he
had
been
stone-deaf
.
Now
*NL*
and
again
he
would
emit
a
bothered
perfunctory
``
Sssh
,
''
which
neither
*NL*
produced
nor
was
expected
to
produce
the
slightest
effect
.
``
They
are
*NL*
very
decent
to
me
here
,
''
said
Jim
.
``
Blake
's
a
little
cad
,
but
Egstrom
's
*NL*
all
right
.
''
He
stood
up
quickly
,
and
walking
with
measured
steps
to
a
*NL*
tripod
telescope
standing
in
the
window
and
pointed
at
the
roadstead
,
*NL*
he
applied
his
eye
to
it
.
``
There
's
that
ship
which
has
been
becalmed
*NL*
outside
all
the
morning
has
got
a
breeze
now
and
is
coming
in
,
''
he
*NL*
remarked
patiently
;
``
I
must
go
and
board
.
''
We
shook
hands
in
silence
,
*NL*
and
he
turned
to
go
.
``
Jim
!
''
I
cried
.
He
looked
round
with
his
hand
on
*NL*
the
lock
.
``
You
--
you
have
thrown
away
something
like
a
fortune
.
''
He
came
*NL*
back
to
me
all
the
way
from
the
door
.
``
Such
a
splendid
old
chap
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
``
How
could
I
?
How
could
I
?
''
His
lips
twitched
.
``
Here
it
does
not
*NL*
matter
.
''
``
Oh
!
you
--
you
--
''
I
began
,
and
had
to
cast
about
for
a
suitable
*NL*
word
,
but
before
I
became
aware
that
there
was
no
name
that
would
just
*NL*
do
,
he
was
gone
.
I
heard
outside
Egstrom
's
deep
gentle
voice
saying
*NL*
cheerily
,
``
That
's
the
Sarah
W.
Granger
,
Jimmy
.
You
must
manage
to
be
*NL*
first
aboard
''
;
and
directly
Blake
struck
in
,
screaming
after
the
manner
*NL*
of
an
outraged
cockatoo
,
``
Tell
the
captain
we
've
got
some
of
his
mail
*NL*
here
.
That
'll
fetch
him
.
D'ye
hear
,
Mister
What
's
-
your-name
?
''
And
there
*NL*
was
Jim
answering
Egstrom
with
something
boyish
in
his
tone
.
``
All
right
.
*NL*
I
'll
make
a
race
of
it
.
''
He
seemed
to
take
refuge
in
the
boat-sailing
*NL*
part
of
that
sorry
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
not
see
him
again
that
trip
,
but
on
my
next
-LRB-
I
had
a
six
months
'
*NL*
charter
-RRB-
I
went
up
to
the
store
.
Ten
yards
away
from
the
door
Blake
's
*NL*
scolding
met
my
ears
,
and
when
I
came
in
he
gave
me
a
glance
of
utter
*NL*
wretchedness
;
Egstrom
,
all
smiles
,
advanced
,
extending
a
large
bony
*NL*
hand
.
``
Glad
to
see
you
,
captain
...
Sssh
...
Been
thinking
you
*NL*
were
about
due
back
here
.
What
did
you
say
,
sir
?
...
Sssh
...
Oh
!
*NL*
him
!
He
has
left
us
.
Come
into
the
parlour
.
''
...
After
the
slam
of
the
*NL*
door
Blake
's
strained
voice
became
faint
,
as
the
voice
of
one
scolding
*NL*
desperately
in
a
wilderness
...
``
Put
us
to
a
great
inconvenience
,
*NL*
too
.
Used
us
badly
--
I
must
say
...
''
``
Where
's
he
gone
to
?
Do
you
*NL*
know
?
''
I
asked
.
``
No
.
It
's
no
use
asking
either
,
''
said
Egstrom
,
standing
*NL*
bewhiskered
and
obliging
before
me
with
his
arms
hanging
down
his
sides
*NL*
clumsily
,
and
a
thin
silver
watch-chain
looped
very
low
on
a
rucked-up
*NL*
blue
serge
waistcoat
.
``
A
man
like
that
do
n't
go
anywhere
in
particular
.
''
*NL*
I
was
too
concerned
at
the
news
to
ask
for
the
explanation
of
that
*NL*
pronouncement
,
and
he
went
on
.
``
He
left
--
let
's
see
--
the
very
day
a
*NL*
steamer
with
returning
pilgrims
from
the
Red
Sea
put
in
here
with
*NL*
two
blades
of
her
propeller
gone
.
Three
weeks
ago
now
.
''
``
Was
n't
there
*NL*
something
said
about
the
Patna
case
?
''
I
asked
,
fearing
the
worst
.
He
*NL*
gave
a
start
,
and
looked
at
me
as
if
I
had
been
a
sorcerer
.
``
Why
,
yes
!
*NL*
How
do
you
know
?
Some
of
them
were
talking
about
it
here
.
There
was
a
*NL*
captain
or
two
,
the
manager
of
Vanlo
's
engineering
shop
at
the
harbour
,
*NL*
two
or
three
others
,
and
myself
.
Jim
was
in
here
too
,
having
a
sandwich
*NL*
and
a
glass
of
beer
;
when
we
are
busy
--
you
see
,
captain
--
there
's
no
time
*NL*
for
a
proper
tiffin
.
He
was
standing
by
this
table
eating
sandwiches
,
*NL*
and
the
rest
of
us
were
round
the
telescope
watching
that
steamer
come
*NL*
in
;
and
by-and-by
Vanlo
's
manager
began
to
talk
about
the
chief
of
the
*NL*
Patna
;
he
had
done
some
repairs
for
him
once
,
and
from
that
he
went
on
*NL*
to
tell
us
what
an
old
ruin
she
was
,
and
the
money
that
had
been
made
*NL*
out
of
her
.
He
came
to
mention
her
last
voyage
,
and
then
we
all
struck
*NL*
in
.
Some
said
one
thing
and
some
another
--
not
much
--
what
you
or
any
*NL*
other
man
might
say
;
and
there
was
some
laughing
.
Captain
O'Brien
of
the
*NL*
Sarah
W.
Granger
,
a
large
,
noisy
old
man
with
a
stick
--
he
was
sitting
*NL*
listening
to
us
in
this
arm-chair
here
--
he
let
drive
suddenly
with
his
*NL*
stick
at
the
floor
,
and
roars
out
,
`
Skunks
!
'
...
Made
us
all
jump
.
*NL*
Vanlo
's
manager
winks
at
us
and
asks
,
`
What
's
the
matter
,
Captain
*NL*
O'Brien
?
'
`
Matter
!
matter
!
'
the
old
man
began
to
shout
;
`
what
are
you
*NL*
Injuns
laughing
at
?
It
's
no
laughing
matter
.
It
's
a
disgrace
to
human
*NL*
natur
'
--
that
's
what
it
is
.
I
would
despise
being
seen
in
the
same
room
*NL*
with
one
of
those
men
.
Yes
,
sir
!
'
He
seemed
to
catch
my
eye
like
,
and
*NL*
I
had
to
speak
out
of
civility
.
`
Skunks
!
'
says
I
,
`
of
course
,
Captain
*NL*
O'Brien
,
and
I
would
n't
care
to
have
them
here
myself
,
so
you
're
quite
*NL*
safe
in
this
room
,
Captain
O'Brien
.
Have
a
little
something
cool
to
*NL*
drink
.
'
`
Dam
'
your
drink
,
Egstrom
,
'
says
he
,
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eye
;
*NL*
`
when
I
want
a
drink
I
will
shout
for
it
.
I
am
going
to
quit
.
It
stinks
*NL*
here
now
.
'
At
this
all
the
others
burst
out
laughing
,
and
out
they
go
*NL*
after
the
old
man
.
And
then
,
sir
,
that
blasted
Jim
he
puts
down
the
*NL*
sandwich
he
had
in
his
hand
and
walks
round
the
table
to
me
;
there
was
*NL*
his
glass
of
beer
poured
out
quite
full
.
'
I
am
off
,
'
he
says
--
just
like
*NL*
this
.
`
It
is
n't
half-past
one
yet
,
'
says
I
;
`
you
might
snatch
a
smoke
*NL*
first
.
'
I
thought
he
meant
it
was
time
for
him
to
go
down
to
his
work
.
*NL*
When
I
understood
what
he
was
up
to
,
my
arms
fell
--
so
!
Ca
n't
get
a
man
*NL*
like
that
every
day
,
you
know
,
sir
;
a
regular
devil
for
sailing
a
boat
;
*NL*
ready
to
go
out
miles
to
sea
to
meet
ships
in
any
sort
of
weather
.
More
*NL*
than
once
a
captain
would
come
in
here
full
of
it
,
and
the
first
thing
*NL*
he
would
say
would
be
,
`
That
's
a
reckless
sort
of
a
lunatic
you
've
got
*NL*
for
water-clerk
,
Egstrom
.
I
was
feeling
my
way
in
at
daylight
under
*NL*
short
canvas
when
there
comes
flying
out
of
the
mist
right
under
my
*NL*
forefoot
a
boat
half
under
water
,
sprays
going
over
the
mast-head
,
two
*NL*
frightened
niggers
on
the
bottom
boards
,
a
yelling
fiend
at
the
tiller
.
*NL*
Hey
!
hey
!
Ship
ahoy
!
ahoy
!
Captain
!
Hey
!
hey
!
Egstrom
&
Blake
's
man
*NL*
first
to
speak
to
you
!
Hey
!
hey
!
Egstrom
&
Blake
!
Hallo
!
hey
!
whoop
!
*NL*
Kick
the
niggers
--
out
reefs
--
a
squall
on
at
the
time
--
shoots
ahead
*NL*
whooping
and
yelling
to
me
to
make
sail
and
he
would
give
me
a
lead
*NL*
in
--
more
like
a
demon
than
a
man
.
Never
saw
a
boat
handled
like
that
in
*NL*
all
my
life
.
Could
n't
have
been
drunk
--
was
he
?
Such
a
quiet
,
soft-spoken
*NL*
chap
too
--
blush
like
a
girl
when
he
came
on
board
...
'
I
tell
you
,
*NL*
Captain
Marlow
,
nobody
had
a
chance
against
us
with
a
strange
ship
when
*NL*
Jim
was
out
.
The
other
ship-chandlers
just
kept
their
old
customers
,
and
*NL*
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Egstrom
appeared
overcome
with
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Why
,
sir
--
it
seemed
as
though
he
would
n't
mind
going
a
hundred
miles
*NL*
out
to
sea
in
an
old
shoe
to
nab
a
ship
for
the
firm
.
If
the
business
*NL*
had
been
his
own
and
all
to
make
yet
,
he
could
n't
have
done
more
in
*NL*
that
way
.
And
now
...
all
at
once
...
like
this
!
Thinks
I
to
myself
:
*NL*
`
Oho
!
a
rise
in
the
screw
--
that
's
the
trouble
--
is
it
?
'
`
All
right
,
'
says
*NL*
I
,
`
no
need
of
all
that
fuss
with
me
,
Jimmy
.
Just
mention
your
figure
.
*NL*
Anything
in
reason
.
'
He
looks
at
me
as
if
he
wanted
to
swallow
something
*NL*
that
stuck
in
his
throat
.
'
I
ca
n't
stop
with
you
.
'
`
What
's
that
blooming
*NL*
joke
?
'
I
asks
.
He
shakes
his
head
,
and
I
could
see
in
his
eye
he
was
as
*NL*
good
as
gone
already
,
sir
.
So
I
turned
to
him
and
slanged
him
till
all
*NL*
was
blue
.
`
What
is
it
you
're
running
away
from
?
'
I
asks
.
`
Who
has
been
*NL*
getting
at
you
?
What
scared
you
?
You
have
n't
as
much
sense
as
a
rat
;
*NL*
they
do
n't
clear
out
from
a
good
ship
.
Where
do
you
expect
to
get
a
*NL*
better
berth
?
--
you
this
and
you
that
.
'
I
made
him
look
sick
,
I
can
tell
*NL*
you
.
`
This
business
ai
n't
going
to
sink
,
'
says
I
.
He
gave
a
big
jump
.
*NL*
`
Good-bye
,
'
he
says
,
nodding
at
me
like
a
lord
;
`
you
ai
n't
half
a
*NL*
bad
chap
,
Egstrom
.
I
give
you
my
word
that
if
you
knew
my
reasons
you
*NL*
would
n't
care
to
keep
me
.
'
`
That
's
the
biggest
lie
you
ever
told
in
your
*NL*
life
,
'
says
I
;
'
I
know
my
own
mind
.
'
He
made
me
so
mad
that
I
had
to
*NL*
laugh
.
`
Ca
n't
you
really
stop
long
enough
to
drink
this
glass
of
beer
*NL*
here
,
you
funny
beggar
,
you
?
'
I
do
n't
know
what
came
over
him
;
he
did
n't
*NL*
seem
able
to
find
the
door
;
something
comical
,
I
can
tell
you
,
captain
.
*NL*
I
drank
the
beer
myself
.
`
Well
,
if
you
're
in
such
a
hurry
,
here
's
luck
*NL*
to
you
in
your
own
drink
,
'
says
I
;
`
only
,
you
mark
my
words
,
if
you
keep
*NL*
up
this
game
you
'll
very
soon
find
that
the
earth
ai
n't
big
enough
to
*NL*
hold
you
--
that
's
all
.
'
He
gave
me
one
black
look
,
and
out
he
rushed
with
*NL*
a
face
fit
to
scare
little
children
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Egstrom
snorted
bitterly
,
and
combed
one
auburn
whisker
with
knotty
*NL*
fingers
.
``
Have
n't
been
able
to
get
a
man
that
was
any
good
since
.
It
's
*NL*
nothing
but
worry
,
worry
,
worry
in
business
.
And
where
might
you
have
*NL*
come
across
him
,
captain
,
if
it
's
fair
to
ask
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
was
the
mate
of
the
Patna
that
voyage
,
''
I
said
,
feeling
that
I
*NL*
owed
some
explanation
.
For
a
time
Egstrom
remained
very
still
,
with
his
*NL*
fingers
plunged
in
the
hair
at
the
side
of
his
face
,
and
then
exploded
.
*NL*
``
And
who
the
devil
cares
about
that
?
''
``
I
daresay
no
one
,
''
I
began
...
*NL*
``
And
what
the
devil
is
he
--
anyhow
--
for
to
go
on
like
this
?
''
He
stuffed
*NL*
suddenly
his
left
whisker
into
his
mouth
and
stood
amazed
.
``
Jee
!
''
he
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
I
told
him
the
earth
would
n't
be
big
enough
to
hold
his
*NL*
caper

CHAPTER
19
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
told
you
these
two
episodes
at
length
to
show
his
manner
of
*NL*
dealing
with
himself
under
the
new
conditions
of
his
life
.
There
were
*NL*
many
others
of
the
sort
,
more
than
I
could
count
on
the
fingers
of
my
*NL*
two
hands
.
They
were
all
equally
tinged
by
a
high-minded
absurdity
of
*NL*
intention
which
made
their
futility
profound
and
touching
.
To
fling
away
*NL*
your
daily
bread
so
as
to
get
your
hands
free
for
a
grapple
with
a
ghost
*NL*
may
be
an
act
of
prosaic
heroism
.
Men
had
done
it
before
-LRB-
though
we
who
*NL*
have
lived
know
full
well
that
it
is
not
the
haunted
soul
but
the
hungry
*NL*
body
that
makes
an
outcast
-RRB-
,
and
men
who
had
eaten
and
meant
to
eat
*NL*
every
day
had
applauded
the
creditable
folly
.
He
was
indeed
unfortunate
,
*NL*
for
all
his
recklessness
could
not
carry
him
out
from
under
the
shadow
.
*NL*
There
was
always
a
doubt
of
his
courage
.
The
truth
seems
to
be
that
*NL*
it
is
impossible
to
lay
the
ghost
of
a
fact
.
You
can
face
it
or
shirk
*NL*
it
--
and
I
have
come
across
a
man
or
two
who
could
wink
at
their
familiar
*NL*
shades
.
Obviously
Jim
was
not
of
the
winking
sort
;
but
what
I
could
*NL*
never
make
up
my
mind
about
was
whether
his
line
of
conduct
amounted
to
*NL*
shirking
his
ghost
or
to
facing
him
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
strained
my
mental
eyesight
only
to
discover
that
,
as
with
the
*NL*
complexion
of
all
our
actions
,
the
shade
of
difference
was
so
delicate
*NL*
that
it
was
impossible
to
say
.
It
might
have
been
flight
and
it
might
*NL*
have
been
a
mode
of
combat
.
To
the
common
mind
he
became
known
as
a
*NL*
rolling
stone
,
because
this
was
the
funniest
part
:
he
did
after
a
time
*NL*
become
perfectly
known
,
and
even
notorious
,
within
the
circle
of
his
*NL*
wanderings
-LRB-
which
had
a
diameter
of
,
say
,
three
thousand
miles
-RRB-
,
in
the
*NL*
same
way
as
an
eccentric
character
is
known
to
a
whole
countryside
.
For
*NL*
instance
,
in
Bankok
,
where
he
found
employment
with
Yucker
Brothers
,
*NL*
charterers
and
teak
merchants
,
it
was
almost
pathetic
to
see
him
go
*NL*
about
in
sunshine
hugging
his
secret
,
which
was
known
to
the
very
*NL*
up-country
logs
on
the
river
.
Schomberg
,
the
keeper
of
the
hotel
where
*NL*
he
boarded
,
a
hirsute
Alsatian
of
manly
bearing
and
an
irrepressible
*NL*
retailer
of
all
the
scandalous
gossip
of
the
place
,
would
,
with
both
*NL*
elbows
on
the
table
,
impart
an
adorned
version
of
the
story
to
any
guest
*NL*
who
cared
to
imbibe
knowledge
along
with
the
more
costly
liquors
.
``
And
,
*NL*
mind
you
,
the
nicest
fellow
you
could
meet
,
''
would
be
his
generous
*NL*
conclusion
;
``
quite
superior
.
''
It
says
a
lot
for
the
casual
crowd
that
*NL*
frequented
Schomberg
's
establishment
that
Jim
managed
to
hang
out
*NL*
in
Bankok
for
a
whole
six
months
.
I
remarked
that
people
,
perfect
*NL*
strangers
,
took
to
him
as
one
takes
to
a
nice
child
.
His
manner
was
*NL*
reserved
,
but
it
was
as
though
his
personal
appearance
,
his
hair
,
his
*NL*
eyes
,
his
smile
,
made
friends
for
him
wherever
he
went
.
And
,
of
course
,
*NL*
he
was
no
fool
.
I
heard
Siegmund
Yucker
-LRB-
native
of
Switzerland
-RRB-
,
a
*NL*
gentle
creature
ravaged
by
a
cruel
dyspepsia
,
and
so
frightfully
lame
*NL*
that
his
head
swung
through
a
quarter
of
a
circle
at
every
step
he
took
,
*NL*
declare
appreciatively
that
for
one
so
young
he
was
``
of
great
gabasidy
,
''
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
a
mere
question
of
cubic
contents
.
``
Why
not
send
*NL*
him
up
country
?
''
I
suggested
anxiously
.
-LRB-
Yucker
Brothers
had
concessions
*NL*
and
teak
forests
in
the
interior
.
-RRB-
``
If
he
has
capacity
,
as
you
say
,
*NL*
he
will
soon
get
hold
of
the
work
.
And
physically
he
is
very
fit
.
His
*NL*
health
is
always
excellent
.
''
``
Ach
!
It
's
a
great
ting
in
dis
goundry
*NL*
to
be
vree
vrom
tispep-shia
,
''
sighed
poor
Yucker
enviously
,
casting
a
*NL*
stealthy
glance
at
the
pit
of
his
ruined
stomach
.
I
left
him
drumming
*NL*
pensively
on
his
desk
and
muttering
,
``
Es
ist
ein
'
Idee
.
Es
ist
ein
'
*NL*
Idee
.
''
Unfortunately
,
that
very
evening
an
unpleasant
affair
took
place
*NL*
in
the
hotel
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
that
I
blame
Jim
very
much
,
but
it
was
a
truly
regrettable
*NL*
incident
.
It
belonged
to
the
lamentable
species
of
bar-room
scuffles
,
*NL*
and
the
other
party
to
it
was
a
cross-eyed
Dane
of
sorts
whose
*NL*
visiting-card
recited
,
under
his
misbegotten
name
:
first
lieutenant
in
*NL*
the
Royal
Siamese
Navy
.
The
fellow
,
of
course
,
was
utterly
hopeless
at
*NL*
billiards
,
but
did
not
like
to
be
beaten
,
I
suppose
.
He
had
had
enough
*NL*
to
drink
to
turn
nasty
after
the
sixth
game
,
and
make
some
scornful
*NL*
remark
at
Jim
's
expense
.
Most
of
the
people
there
did
n't
hear
what
*NL*
was
said
,
and
those
who
had
heard
seemed
to
have
had
all
precise
*NL*
recollection
scared
out
of
them
by
the
appalling
nature
of
the
*NL*
consequences
that
immediately
ensued
.
It
was
very
lucky
for
the
Dane
*NL*
that
he
could
swim
,
because
the
room
opened
on
a
verandah
and
the
Menam
*NL*
flowed
below
very
wide
and
black
.
A
boat-load
of
Chinamen
,
bound
,
as
*NL*
likely
as
not
,
on
some
thieving
expedition
,
fished
out
the
officer
of
*NL*
the
King
of
Siam
,
and
Jim
turned
up
at
about
midnight
on
board
my
ship
*NL*
without
a
hat
.
``
Everybody
in
the
room
seemed
to
know
,
''
he
said
,
gasping
*NL*
yet
from
the
contest
,
as
it
were
.
He
was
rather
sorry
,
on
general
*NL*
principles
,
for
what
had
happened
,
though
in
this
case
there
had
been
,
*NL*
he
said
,
``
no
option
.
''
But
what
dismayed
him
was
to
find
the
nature
of
*NL*
his
burden
as
well
known
to
everybody
as
though
he
had
gone
about
all
*NL*
that
time
carrying
it
on
his
shoulders
.
Naturally
after
this
he
could
n't
*NL*
remain
in
the
place
.
He
was
universally
condemned
for
the
brutal
*NL*
violence
,
so
unbecoming
a
man
in
his
delicate
position
;
some
maintained
*NL*
he
had
been
disgracefully
drunk
at
the
time
;
others
criticised
his
want
*NL*
of
tact
.
Even
Schomberg
was
very
much
annoyed
.
``
He
is
a
very
nice
young
*NL*
man
,
''
he
said
argumentatively
to
me
,
``
but
the
lieutenant
is
a
first-rate
*NL*
fellow
too
.
He
dines
every
night
at
my
table
d'hote
,
you
know
.
And
*NL*
there
's
a
billiard-cue
broken
.
I
ca
n't
allow
that
.
First
thing
this
*NL*
morning
I
went
over
with
my
apologies
to
the
lieutenant
,
and
I
think
*NL*
I
've
made
it
all
right
for
myself
;
but
only
think
,
captain
,
if
everybody
*NL*
started
such
games
!
Why
,
the
man
might
have
been
drowned
!
And
here
I
*NL*
ca
n't
run
out
into
the
next
street
and
buy
a
new
cue
.
I
've
got
to
write
*NL*
to
Europe
for
them
.
No
,
no
!
A
temper
like
that
wo
n't
do
!
''
...
He
was
*NL*
extremely
sore
on
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
was
the
worst
incident
of
all
in
his
--
his
retreat
.
Nobody
could
*NL*
deplore
it
more
than
myself
;
for
if
,
as
somebody
said
hearing
him
*NL*
mentioned
,
``
Oh
yes
!
I
know
.
He
has
knocked
about
a
good
deal
out
here
,
''
*NL*
yet
he
had
somehow
avoided
being
battered
and
chipped
in
the
process
.
*NL*
This
last
affair
,
however
,
made
me
seriously
uneasy
,
because
if
his
*NL*
exquisite
sensibilities
were
to
go
the
length
of
involving
him
in
*NL*
pot-house
shindies
,
he
would
lose
his
name
of
an
inoffensive
,
if
*NL*
aggravating
,
fool
,
and
acquire
that
of
a
common
loafer
.
For
all
my
*NL*
confidence
in
him
I
could
not
help
reflecting
that
in
such
cases
*NL*
from
the
name
to
the
thing
itself
is
but
a
step
.
I
suppose
you
will
*NL*
understand
that
by
that
time
I
could
not
think
of
washing
my
hands
*NL*
of
him
.
I
took
him
away
from
Bankok
in
my
ship
,
and
we
had
a
longish
*NL*
passage
.
It
was
pitiful
to
see
how
he
shrank
within
himself
.
A
seaman
,
*NL*
even
if
a
mere
passenger
,
takes
an
interest
in
a
ship
,
and
looks
at
*NL*
the
sea-life
around
him
with
the
critical
enjoyment
of
a
painter
,
*NL*
for
instance
,
looking
at
another
man
's
work
.
In
every
sense
of
the
*NL*
expression
he
is
``
on
deck
''
;
but
my
Jim
,
for
the
most
part
,
skulked
down
*NL*
below
as
though
he
had
been
a
stowaway
.
He
infected
me
so
that
I
avoided
*NL*
speaking
on
professional
matters
,
such
as
would
suggest
themselves
*NL*
naturally
to
two
sailors
during
a
passage
.
For
whole
days
we
did
*NL*
not
exchange
a
word
;
I
felt
extremely
unwilling
to
give
orders
to
my
*NL*
officers
in
his
presence
.
Often
,
when
alone
with
him
on
deck
or
in
the
*NL*
cabin
,
we
did
n't
know
what
to
do
with
our
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
placed
him
with
De
Jongh
,
as
you
know
,
glad
enough
to
dispose
of
him
*NL*
in
any
way
,
yet
persuaded
that
his
position
was
now
growing
intolerable
.
*NL*
He
had
lost
some
of
that
elasticity
which
had
enabled
him
to
rebound
*NL*
back
into
his
uncompromising
position
after
every
overthrow
.
One
*NL*
day
,
coming
ashore
,
I
saw
him
standing
on
the
quay
;
the
water
of
the
*NL*
roadstead
and
the
sea
in
the
offing
made
one
smooth
ascending
plane
,
and
*NL*
the
outermost
ships
at
anchor
seemed
to
ride
motionless
in
the
sky
.
*NL*
He
was
waiting
for
his
boat
,
which
was
being
loaded
at
our
feet
*NL*
with
packages
of
small
stores
for
some
vessel
ready
to
leave
.
After
*NL*
exchanging
greetings
,
we
remained
silent
--
side
by
side
.
``
Jove
!
''
he
said
*NL*
suddenly
,
``
this
is
killing
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
smiled
at
me
;
I
must
say
he
generally
could
manage
a
smile
.
I
made
*NL*
no
reply
.
I
knew
very
well
he
was
not
alluding
to
his
duties
;
he
had
an
*NL*
easy
time
of
it
with
De
Jongh
.
Nevertheless
,
as
soon
as
he
had
spoken
*NL*
I
became
completely
convinced
that
the
work
was
killing
.
I
did
not
even
*NL*
look
at
him
.
``
Would
you
like
,
''
said
I
,
``
to
leave
this
part
of
the
world
*NL*
altogether
;
try
California
or
the
West
Coast
?
I
'll
see
what
I
can
*NL*
do
...
''
He
interrupted
me
a
little
scornfully
.
``
What
difference
would
*NL*
it
make
?
''
...
I
felt
at
once
convinced
that
he
was
right
.
It
would
make
*NL*
no
difference
;
it
was
not
relief
he
wanted
;
I
seemed
to
perceive
dimly
*NL*
that
what
he
wanted
,
what
he
was
,
as
it
were
,
waiting
for
,
was
something
*NL*
not
easy
to
define
--
something
in
the
nature
of
an
opportunity
.
I
had
*NL*
given
him
many
opportunities
,
but
they
had
been
merely
opportunities
to
*NL*
earn
his
bread
.
Yet
what
more
could
any
man
do
?
The
position
struck
me
*NL*
as
hopeless
,
and
poor
Brierly
's
saying
recurred
to
me
,
``
Let
him
creep
*NL*
twenty
feet
underground
and
stay
there
.
''
Better
that
,
I
thought
,
than
*NL*
this
waiting
above
ground
for
the
impossible
.
Yet
one
could
not
be
sure
*NL*
even
of
that
.
There
and
then
,
before
his
boat
was
three
oars
'
lengths
*NL*
away
from
the
quay
,
I
had
made
up
my
mind
to
go
and
consult
Stein
in
the
*NL*
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
Stein
was
a
wealthy
and
respected
merchant
.
His
``
house
''
-LRB-
because
*NL*
it
was
a
house
,
Stein
&
Co.
,
and
there
was
some
sort
of
partner
who
,
*NL*
as
Stein
said
,
``
looked
after
the
Moluccas
''
-RRB-
had
a
large
inter-island
*NL*
business
,
with
a
lot
of
trading
posts
established
in
the
most
*NL*
out-of-the-way
places
for
collecting
the
produce
.
His
wealth
and
his
*NL*
respectability
were
not
exactly
the
reasons
why
I
was
anxious
to
seek
*NL*
his
advice
.
I
desired
to
confide
my
difficulty
to
him
because
he
was
*NL*
one
of
the
most
trustworthy
men
I
had
ever
known
.
The
gentle
light
of
a
*NL*
simple
,
unwearied
,
as
it
were
,
and
intelligent
good-nature
illumined
his
*NL*
long
hairless
face
.
It
had
deep
downward
folds
,
and
was
pale
as
of
a
*NL*
man
who
had
always
led
a
sedentary
life
--
which
was
indeed
very
far
from
*NL*
being
the
case
.
His
hair
was
thin
,
and
brushed
back
from
a
massive
and
*NL*
lofty
forehead
.
One
fancied
that
at
twenty
he
must
have
looked
very
much
*NL*
like
what
he
was
now
at
threescore
.
It
was
a
student
's
face
;
only
the
*NL*
eyebrows
nearly
all
white
,
thick
and
bushy
,
together
with
the
resolute
*NL*
searching
glance
that
came
from
under
them
,
were
not
in
accord
with
his
,
*NL*
I
may
say
,
learned
appearance
.
He
was
tall
and
loose-jointed
;
his
slight
*NL*
stoop
,
together
with
an
innocent
smile
,
made
him
appear
benevolently
*NL*
ready
to
lend
you
his
ear
;
his
long
arms
with
pale
big
hands
had
rare
*NL*
deliberate
gestures
of
a
pointing
out
,
demonstrating
kind
.
I
speak
of
*NL*
him
at
length
,
because
under
this
exterior
,
and
in
conjunction
with
*NL*
an
upright
and
indulgent
nature
,
this
man
possessed
an
intrepidity
of
*NL*
spirit
and
a
physical
courage
that
could
have
been
called
reckless
had
*NL*
it
not
been
like
a
natural
function
of
the
body
--
say
good
digestion
,
for
*NL*
instance
--
completely
unconscious
of
itself
.
It
is
sometimes
said
of
a
*NL*
man
that
he
carries
his
life
in
his
hand
.
Such
a
saying
would
have
been
*NL*
inadequate
if
applied
to
him
;
during
the
early
part
of
his
existence
in
*NL*
the
East
he
had
been
playing
ball
with
it
.
All
this
was
in
the
past
,
but
*NL*
I
knew
the
story
of
his
life
and
the
origin
of
his
fortune
.
He
was
also
*NL*
a
naturalist
of
some
distinction
,
or
perhaps
I
should
say
a
learned
*NL*
collector
.
Entomology
was
his
special
study
.
His
collection
of
*NL*
Buprestidae
and
Longicorns
--
beetles
all
--
horrible
miniature
monsters
,
*NL*
looking
malevolent
in
death
and
immobility
,
and
his
cabinet
of
*NL*
butterflies
,
beautiful
and
hovering
under
the
glass
of
cases
on
*NL*
lifeless
wings
,
had
spread
his
fame
far
over
the
earth
.
The
name
of
this
*NL*
merchant
,
adventurer
,
sometime
adviser
of
a
Malay
sultan
-LRB-
to
whom
he
*NL*
never
alluded
otherwise
than
as
``
my
poor
Mohammed
Bonso
''
-RRB-
,
had
,
on
*NL*
account
of
a
few
bushels
of
dead
insects
,
become
known
to
learned
*NL*
persons
in
Europe
,
who
could
have
had
no
conception
,
and
certainly
would
*NL*
not
have
cared
to
know
anything
,
of
his
life
or
character
.
I
,
who
knew
,
*NL*
considered
him
an
eminently
suitable
person
to
receive
my
confidences
*NL*
about
Jim
's
difficulties
as
well
as
my
own
.

CHAPTER
20
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Late
in
the
evening
I
entered
his
study
,
after
traversing
an
imposing
*NL*
but
empty
dining-room
very
dimly
lit
.
The
house
was
silent
.
I
was
*NL*
preceded
by
an
elderly
grim
Javanese
servant
in
a
sort
of
livery
of
*NL*
white
jacket
and
yellow
sarong
,
who
,
after
throwing
the
door
open
,
*NL*
exclaimed
low
,
``
O
master
!
''
and
stepping
aside
,
vanished
in
a
mysterious
*NL*
way
as
though
he
had
been
a
ghost
only
momentarily
embodied
for
that
*NL*
particular
service
.
Stein
turned
round
with
the
chair
,
and
in
the
same
*NL*
movement
his
spectacles
seemed
to
get
pushed
up
on
his
forehead
.
He
*NL*
welcomed
me
in
his
quiet
and
humorous
voice
.
Only
one
corner
of
the
vast
*NL*
room
,
the
corner
in
which
stood
his
writing-desk
,
was
strongly
lighted
*NL*
by
a
shaded
reading-lamp
,
and
the
rest
of
the
spacious
apartment
melted
*NL*
into
shapeless
gloom
like
a
cavern
.
Narrow
shelves
filled
with
dark
*NL*
boxes
of
uniform
shape
and
colour
ran
round
the
walls
,
not
from
floor
*NL*
to
ceiling
,
but
in
a
sombre
belt
about
four
feet
broad
.
Catacombs
of
*NL*
beetles
.
Wooden
tablets
were
hung
above
at
irregular
intervals
.
The
*NL*
light
reached
one
of
them
,
and
the
word
Coleoptera
written
in
gold
*NL*
letters
glittered
mysteriously
upon
a
vast
dimness
.
The
glass
cases
*NL*
containing
the
collection
of
butterflies
were
ranged
in
three
long
rows
*NL*
upon
slender-legged
little
tables
.
One
of
these
cases
had
been
removed
*NL*
from
its
place
and
stood
on
the
desk
,
which
was
bestrewn
with
oblong
*NL*
slips
of
paper
blackened
with
minute
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
So
you
see
me
--
so
,
''
he
said
.
His
hand
hovered
over
the
case
where
*NL*
a
butterfly
in
solitary
grandeur
spread
out
dark
bronze
wings
,
seven
*NL*
inches
or
more
across
,
with
exquisite
white
veinings
and
a
gorgeous
*NL*
border
of
yellow
spots
.
``
Only
one
specimen
like
this
they
have
in
_
your
_
*NL*
London
,
and
then
--
no
more
.
To
my
small
native
town
this
my
collection
I
*NL*
shall
bequeath
.
Something
of
me
.
The
best
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
bent
forward
in
the
chair
and
gazed
intently
,
his
chin
over
the
*NL*
front
of
the
case
.
I
stood
at
his
back
.
``
Marvellous
,
''
he
whispered
,
and
*NL*
seemed
to
forget
my
presence
.
His
history
was
curious
.
He
had
been
born
*NL*
in
Bavaria
,
and
when
a
youth
of
twenty-two
had
taken
an
active
part
in
*NL*
the
revolutionary
movement
of
1848
.
Heavily
compromised
,
he
managed
*NL*
to
make
his
escape
,
and
at
first
found
a
refuge
with
a
poor
republican
*NL*
watchmaker
in
Trieste
.
From
there
he
made
his
way
to
Tripoli
with
a
*NL*
stock
of
cheap
watches
to
hawk
about
,
--
not
a
very
great
opening
truly
,
*NL*
but
it
turned
out
lucky
enough
,
because
it
was
there
he
came
upon
a
*NL*
Dutch
traveller
--
a
rather
famous
man
,
I
believe
,
but
I
do
n't
remember
*NL*
his
name
.
It
was
that
naturalist
who
,
engaging
him
as
a
sort
of
*NL*
assistant
,
took
him
to
the
East
.
They
travelled
in
the
Archipelago
*NL*
together
and
separately
,
collecting
insects
and
birds
,
for
four
years
or
*NL*
more
.
Then
the
naturalist
went
home
,
and
Stein
,
having
no
home
to
go
to
,
*NL*
remained
with
an
old
trader
he
had
come
across
in
his
journeys
in
the
*NL*
interior
of
Celebes
--
if
Celebes
may
be
said
to
have
an
interior
.
This
*NL*
old
Scotsman
,
the
only
white
man
allowed
to
reside
in
the
country
at
the
*NL*
time
,
was
a
privileged
friend
of
the
chief
ruler
of
Wajo
States
,
who
*NL*
was
a
woman
.
I
often
heard
Stein
relate
how
that
chap
,
who
was
slightly
*NL*
paralysed
on
one
side
,
had
introduced
him
to
the
native
court
a
short
*NL*
time
before
another
stroke
carried
him
off
.
He
was
a
heavy
man
with
*NL*
a
patriarchal
white
beard
,
and
of
imposing
stature
.
He
came
into
*NL*
the
council-hall
where
all
the
rajahs
,
pangerans
,
and
headmen
were
*NL*
assembled
,
with
the
queen
,
a
fat
wrinkled
woman
-LRB-
very
free
in
her
*NL*
speech
,
Stein
said
-RRB-
,
reclining
on
a
high
couch
under
a
canopy
.
He
*NL*
dragged
his
leg
,
thumping
with
his
stick
,
and
grasped
Stein
's
arm
,
*NL*
leading
him
right
up
to
the
couch
.
``
Look
,
queen
,
and
you
rajahs
,
this
is
*NL*
my
son
,
''
he
proclaimed
in
a
stentorian
voice
.
``
I
have
traded
with
your
*NL*
fathers
,
and
when
I
die
he
shall
trade
with
you
and
your
sons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
means
of
this
simple
formality
Stein
inherited
the
Scotsman
's
*NL*
privileged
position
and
all
his
stock-in-trade
,
together
with
a
*NL*
fortified
house
on
the
banks
of
the
only
navigable
river
in
the
country
.
*NL*
Shortly
afterwards
the
old
queen
,
who
was
so
free
in
her
speech
,
died
,
*NL*
and
the
country
became
disturbed
by
various
pretenders
to
the
throne
.
*NL*
Stein
joined
the
party
of
a
younger
son
,
the
one
of
whom
thirty
years
*NL*
later
he
never
spoke
otherwise
but
as
``
my
poor
Mohammed
Bonso
.
''
They
*NL*
both
became
the
heroes
of
innumerable
exploits
;
they
had
wonderful
*NL*
adventures
,
and
once
stood
a
siege
in
the
Scotsman
's
house
for
a
month
,
*NL*
with
only
a
score
of
followers
against
a
whole
army
.
I
believe
the
*NL*
natives
talk
of
that
war
to
this
day
.
Meantime
,
it
seems
,
Stein
never
*NL*
failed
to
annex
on
his
own
account
every
butterfly
or
beetle
he
could
*NL*
lay
hands
on
.
After
some
eight
years
of
war
,
negotiations
,
false
truces
,
*NL*
sudden
outbreaks
,
reconciliation
,
treachery
,
and
so
on
,
and
just
as
*NL*
peace
seemed
at
last
permanently
established
,
his
``
poor
Mohammed
*NL*
Bonso
''
was
assassinated
at
the
gate
of
his
own
royal
residence
while
*NL*
dismounting
in
the
highest
spirits
on
his
return
from
a
successful
*NL*
deer-hunt
.
This
event
rendered
Stein
's
position
extremely
insecure
,
*NL*
but
he
would
have
stayed
perhaps
had
it
not
been
that
a
short
time
*NL*
afterwards
he
lost
Mohammed
's
sister
-LRB-
``
my
dear
wife
the
princess
,
''
he
*NL*
used
to
say
solemnly
-RRB-
,
by
whom
he
had
had
a
daughter
--
mother
and
child
*NL*
both
dying
within
three
days
of
each
other
from
some
infectious
fever
.
*NL*
He
left
the
country
,
which
this
cruel
loss
had
made
unbearable
to
*NL*
him
.
Thus
ended
the
first
and
adventurous
part
of
his
existence
.
What
*NL*
followed
was
so
different
that
,
but
for
the
reality
of
sorrow
which
*NL*
remained
with
him
,
this
strange
part
must
have
resembled
a
dream
.
He
*NL*
had
a
little
money
;
he
started
life
afresh
,
and
in
the
course
of
years
*NL*
acquired
a
considerable
fortune
.
At
first
he
had
travelled
a
good
deal
*NL*
amongst
the
islands
,
but
age
had
stolen
upon
him
,
and
of
late
he
seldom
*NL*
left
his
spacious
house
three
miles
out
of
town
,
with
an
extensive
*NL*
garden
,
and
surrounded
by
stables
,
offices
,
and
bamboo
cottages
for
*NL*
his
servants
and
dependants
,
of
whom
he
had
many
.
He
drove
in
his
buggy
*NL*
every
morning
to
town
,
where
he
had
an
office
with
white
and
Chinese
*NL*
clerks
.
He
owned
a
small
fleet
of
schooners
and
native
craft
,
and
dealt
*NL*
in
island
produce
on
a
large
scale
.
For
the
rest
he
lived
solitary
,
*NL*
but
not
misanthropic
,
with
his
books
and
his
collection
,
classing
and
*NL*
arranging
specimens
,
corresponding
with
entomologists
in
Europe
,
writing
*NL*
up
a
descriptive
catalogue
of
his
treasures
.
Such
was
the
history
of
*NL*
the
man
whom
I
had
come
to
consult
upon
Jim
's
case
without
any
definite
*NL*
hope
.
Simply
to
hear
what
he
would
have
to
say
would
have
been
a
relief
.
*NL*
I
was
very
anxious
,
but
I
respected
the
intense
,
almost
passionate
,
*NL*
absorption
with
which
he
looked
at
a
butterfly
,
as
though
on
the
bronze
*NL*
sheen
of
these
frail
wings
,
in
the
white
tracings
,
in
the
gorgeous
*NL*
markings
,
he
could
see
other
things
,
an
image
of
something
as
perishable
*NL*
and
defying
destruction
as
these
delicate
and
lifeless
tissues
*NL*
displaying
a
splendour
unmarred
by
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Marvellous
!
''
he
repeated
,
looking
up
at
me
.
``
Look
!
The
beauty
--
but
*NL*
that
is
nothing
--
look
at
the
accuracy
,
the
harmony
.
And
so
fragile
!
And
*NL*
so
strong
!
And
so
exact
!
This
is
Nature
--
the
balance
of
colossal
forces
.
*NL*
Every
star
is
so
--
and
every
blade
of
grass
stands
so
--
and
the
mighty
*NL*
Kosmos
ib
perfect
equilibrium
produces
--
this
.
This
wonder
;
this
*NL*
masterpiece
of
Nature
--
the
great
artist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Never
heard
an
entomologist
go
on
like
this
,
''
I
observed
cheerfully
.
*NL*
``
Masterpiece
!
And
what
of
man
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Man
is
amazing
,
but
he
is
not
a
masterpiece
,
''
he
said
,
keeping
his
*NL*
eyes
fixed
on
the
glass
case
.
``
Perhaps
the
artist
was
a
little
mad
.
Eh
?
*NL*
What
do
you
think
?
Sometimes
it
seems
to
me
that
man
is
come
where
he
is
*NL*
not
wanted
,
where
there
is
no
place
for
him
;
for
if
not
,
why
should
*NL*
he
want
all
the
place
?
Why
should
he
run
about
here
and
there
making
*NL*
a
great
noise
about
himself
,
talking
about
the
stars
,
disturbing
the
*NL*
blades
of
grass
?
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Catching
butterflies
,
''
I
chimed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
smiled
,
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
,
and
stretched
his
legs
.
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
captured
this
rare
specimen
myself
one
very
fine
*NL*
morning
.
And
I
had
a
very
big
emotion
.
You
do
n't
know
what
it
is
for
a
*NL*
collector
to
capture
such
a
rare
specimen
.
You
ca
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
smiled
at
my
ease
in
a
rocking-chair
.
His
eyes
seemed
to
look
far
*NL*
beyond
the
wall
at
which
they
stared
;
and
he
narrated
how
,
one
night
,
*NL*
a
messenger
arrived
from
his
``
poor
Mohammed
,
''
requiring
his
presence
*NL*
at
the
``
residenz
''
--
as
he
called
it
--
which
was
distant
some
nine
or
ten
*NL*
miles
by
a
bridle-path
over
a
cultivated
plain
,
with
patches
of
forest
*NL*
here
and
there
.
Early
in
the
morning
he
started
from
his
fortified
*NL*
house
,
after
embracing
his
little
Emma
,
and
leaving
the
``
princess
,
''
his
*NL*
wife
,
in
command
.
He
described
how
she
came
with
him
as
far
as
the
*NL*
gate
,
walking
with
one
hand
on
the
neck
of
his
horse
;
she
had
on
a
white
*NL*
jacket
,
gold
pins
in
her
hair
,
and
a
brown
leather
belt
over
her
left
*NL*
shoulder
with
a
revolver
in
it
.
``
She
talked
as
women
will
talk
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
``
telling
me
to
be
careful
,
and
to
try
to
get
back
before
dark
,
and
*NL*
what
a
great
wickedness
it
was
for
me
to
go
alone
.
We
were
at
war
,
and
*NL*
the
country
was
not
safe
;
my
men
were
putting
up
bullet-proof
shutters
*NL*
to
the
house
and
loading
their
rifles
,
and
she
begged
me
to
have
no
fear
*NL*
for
her
.
She
could
defend
the
house
against
anybody
till
I
returned
.
And
*NL*
I
laughed
with
pleasure
a
little
.
I
liked
to
see
her
so
brave
and
young
*NL*
and
strong
.
I
too
was
young
then
.
At
the
gate
she
caught
hold
of
my
*NL*
hand
and
gave
it
one
squeeze
and
fell
back
.
I
made
my
horse
stand
still
*NL*
outside
till
I
heard
the
bars
of
the
gate
put
up
behind
me
.
There
was
a
*NL*
great
enemy
of
mine
,
a
great
noble
--
and
a
great
rascal
too
--
roaming
with
*NL*
a
band
in
the
neighbourhood
.
I
cantered
for
four
or
five
miles
;
there
*NL*
had
been
rain
in
the
night
,
but
the
musts
had
gone
up
,
up
--
and
the
*NL*
face
of
the
earth
was
clean
;
it
lay
smiling
to
me
,
so
fresh
and
*NL*
innocent
--
like
a
little
child
.
Suddenly
somebody
fires
a
volley
--
twenty
*NL*
shots
at
least
it
seemed
to
me
.
I
hear
bullets
sing
in
my
ear
,
and
*NL*
my
hat
jumps
to
the
back
of
my
head
.
It
was
a
little
intrigue
,
you
*NL*
understand
.
They
got
my
poor
Mohammed
to
send
for
me
and
then
laid
*NL*
that
ambush
.
I
see
it
all
in
a
minute
,
and
I
think
--
This
wants
a
little
*NL*
management
.
My
pony
snort
,
jump
,
and
stand
,
and
I
fall
slowly
forward
*NL*
with
my
head
on
his
mane
.
He
begins
to
walk
,
and
with
one
eye
I
could
*NL*
see
over
his
neck
a
faint
cloud
of
smoke
hanging
in
front
of
a
clump
*NL*
of
bamboos
to
my
left
.
I
think
--
Aha
!
my
friends
,
why
you
not
wait
long
*NL*
enough
before
you
shoot
?
This
is
not
yet
gelungen
.
Oh
no
!
I
get
hold
of
*NL*
my
revolver
with
my
right
hand
--
quiet
--
quiet
.
After
all
,
there
were
only
*NL*
seven
of
these
rascals
.
They
get
up
from
the
grass
and
start
running
*NL*
with
their
sarongs
tucked
up
,
waving
spears
above
their
heads
,
and
*NL*
yelling
to
each
other
to
look
out
and
catch
the
horse
,
because
I
was
*NL*
dead
.
I
let
them
come
as
close
as
the
door
here
,
and
then
bang
,
bang
,
*NL*
bang
--
take
aim
each
time
too
.
One
more
shot
I
fire
at
a
man
's
back
,
but
*NL*
I
miss
.
Too
far
already
.
And
then
I
sit
alone
on
my
horse
with
the
clean
*NL*
earth
smiling
at
me
,
and
there
are
the
bodies
of
three
men
lying
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
One
was
curled
up
like
a
dog
,
another
on
his
back
had
an
arm
*NL*
over
his
eyes
as
if
to
keep
off
the
sun
,
and
the
third
man
he
draws
up
*NL*
his
leg
very
slowly
and
makes
it
with
one
kick
straight
again
.
I
watch
*NL*
him
very
carefully
from
my
horse
,
but
there
is
no
more
--
bleibt
ganz
*NL*
ruhig
--
keep
still
,
so
.
And
as
I
looked
at
his
face
for
some
sign
of
life
*NL*
I
observed
something
like
a
faint
shadow
pass
over
his
forehead
.
It
was
*NL*
the
shadow
of
this
butterfly
.
Look
at
the
form
of
the
wing
.
This
species
*NL*
fly
high
with
a
strong
flight
.
I
raised
my
eyes
and
I
saw
him
fluttering
*NL*
away
.
I
think
--
Can
it
be
possible
?
And
then
I
lost
him
.
I
dismounted
*NL*
and
went
on
very
slow
,
leading
my
horse
and
holding
my
revolver
with
one
*NL*
hand
and
my
eyes
darting
up
and
down
and
right
and
left
,
everywhere
!
At
*NL*
last
I
saw
him
sitting
on
a
small
heap
of
dirt
ten
feet
away
.
At
once
*NL*
my
heart
began
to
beat
quick
.
I
let
go
my
horse
,
keep
my
revolver
in
one
*NL*
hand
,
and
with
the
other
snatch
my
soft
felt
hat
off
my
head
.
One
step
.
*NL*
Steady
.
Another
step
.
Flop
!
I
got
him
!
When
I
got
up
I
shook
like
a
leaf
*NL*
with
excitement
,
and
when
I
opened
these
beautiful
wings
and
made
sure
*NL*
what
a
rare
and
so
extraordinary
perfect
specimen
I
had
,
my
head
went
*NL*
round
and
my
legs
became
so
weak
with
emotion
that
I
had
to
sit
on
the
*NL*
ground
.
I
had
greatly
desired
to
possess
myself
of
a
specimen
of
that
*NL*
species
when
collecting
for
the
professor
.
I
took
long
journeys
and
*NL*
underwent
great
privations
;
I
had
dreamed
of
him
in
my
sleep
,
and
here
*NL*
suddenly
I
had
him
in
my
fingers
--
for
myself
!
In
the
words
of
the
poet
''
*NL*
-LRB-
he
pronounced
it
``
boet
''
-RRB-
--
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
So
halt
'
ich
's
endlich
denn
in
meinen
Handen
,
*NL*
Und
nenn
'
es
in
gewissem
Sinne
mein
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
to
the
last
word
the
emphasis
of
a
suddenly
lowered
voice
,
and
*NL*
withdrew
his
eyes
slowly
from
my
face
.
He
began
to
charge
a
long-stemmed
*NL*
pipe
busily
and
in
silence
,
then
,
pausing
with
his
thumb
on
the
orifice
*NL*
of
the
bowl
,
looked
again
at
me
significantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Yes
,
my
good
friend
.
On
that
day
I
had
nothing
to
desire
;
I
had
*NL*
greatly
annoyed
my
principal
enemy
;
I
was
young
,
strong
;
I
had
*NL*
friendship
;
I
had
the
love
''
-LRB-
he
said
``
lof
''
-RRB-
``
of
woman
,
a
child
I
had
,
*NL*
to
make
my
heart
very
full
--
and
even
what
I
had
once
dreamed
in
my
sleep
*NL*
had
come
into
my
hand
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
struck
a
match
,
which
flared
violently
.
His
thoughtful
placid
face
*NL*
twitched
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Friend
,
wife
,
child
,
''
he
said
slowly
,
gazing
at
the
small
*NL*
flame
--
``
phoo
!
''
The
match
was
blown
out
.
He
sighed
and
turned
again
to
*NL*
the
glass
case
.
The
frail
and
beautiful
wings
quivered
faintly
,
as
if
*NL*
his
breath
had
for
an
instant
called
back
to
life
that
gorgeous
object
*NL*
of
his
dreams
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
The
work
,
''
he
began
suddenly
,
pointing
to
the
scattered
slips
,
and
in
*NL*
his
usual
gentle
and
cheery
tone
,
``
is
making
great
progress
.
I
have
been
*NL*
this
rare
specimen
describing
...
Na
!
And
what
is
your
good
news
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
To
tell
you
the
truth
,
Stein
,
''
I
said
with
an
effort
that
surprised
*NL*
me
,
``
I
came
here
to
describe
a
specimen
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Butterfly
?
''
he
asked
,
with
an
unbelieving
and
humorous
eagerness
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Nothing
so
perfect
,
''
I
answered
,
feeling
suddenly
dispirited
with
all
*NL*
sorts
of
doubts
.
``
A
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Ach
so
!
''
he
murmured
,
and
his
smiling
countenance
,
turned
to
me
,
*NL*
became
grave
.
Then
after
looking
at
me
for
a
while
he
said
slowly
,
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
am
a
man
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Here
you
have
him
as
he
was
;
he
knew
how
to
be
so
generously
*NL*
encouraging
as
to
make
a
scrupulous
man
hesitate
on
the
brink
of
*NL*
confidence
;
but
if
I
did
hesitate
it
was
not
for
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
heard
me
out
,
sitting
with
crossed
legs
.
Sometimes
his
head
would
*NL*
disappear
completely
in
a
great
eruption
of
smoke
,
and
a
sympathetic
*NL*
growl
would
come
out
from
the
cloud
.
When
I
finished
he
uncrossed
his
*NL*
legs
,
laid
down
his
pipe
,
leaned
forward
towards
me
earnestly
with
his
*NL*
elbows
on
the
arms
of
his
chair
,
the
tips
of
his
fingers
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
understand
very
well
.
He
is
romantic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
had
diagnosed
the
case
for
me
,
and
at
first
I
was
quite
startled
to
*NL*
find
how
simple
it
was
;
and
indeed
our
conference
resembled
so
much
a
*NL*
medical
consultation
--
Stein
,
of
learned
aspect
,
sitting
in
an
arm-chair
*NL*
before
his
desk
;
I
,
anxious
,
in
another
,
facing
him
,
but
a
little
to
one
*NL*
side
--
that
it
seemed
natural
to
ask
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
's
good
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
lifted
up
a
long
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
There
is
only
one
remedy
!
One
thing
alone
can
us
from
being
ourselves
*NL*
cure
!
''
The
finger
came
down
on
the
desk
with
a
smart
rap
.
The
case
*NL*
which
he
had
made
to
look
so
simple
before
became
if
possible
still
*NL*
simpler
--
and
altogether
hopeless
.
There
was
a
pause
.
``
Yes
,
''
said
I
,
*NL*
``
strictly
speaking
,
the
question
is
not
how
to
get
cured
,
but
how
to
*NL*
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
approved
with
his
head
,
a
little
sadly
as
it
seemed
.
``
Ja
!
ja
!
In
*NL*
general
,
adapting
the
words
of
your
great
poet
:
That
is
the
*NL*
question
...
''
He
went
on
nodding
sympathetically
...
``
How
to
be
!
*NL*
Ach
!
How
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
stood
up
with
the
tips
of
his
fingers
resting
on
the
desk
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
We
want
in
so
many
different
ways
to
be
,
''
he
began
again
.
``
This
*NL*
magnificent
butterfly
finds
a
little
heap
of
dirt
and
sits
still
on
it
;
*NL*
but
man
he
will
never
on
his
heap
of
mud
keep
still
.
He
want
to
be
so
,
*NL*
and
again
he
want
to
be
so
...
''
He
moved
his
hand
up
,
then
down
...
*NL*
``
He
wants
to
be
a
saint
,
and
he
wants
to
be
a
devil
--
and
every
time
he
*NL*
shuts
his
eyes
he
sees
himself
as
a
very
fine
fellow
--
so
fine
as
he
can
*NL*
never
be
...
In
a
dream
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
lowered
the
glass
lid
,
the
automatic
lock
clicked
sharply
,
and
*NL*
taking
up
the
case
in
both
hands
he
bore
it
religiously
away
to
its
*NL*
place
,
passing
out
of
the
bright
circle
of
the
lamp
into
the
ring
of
*NL*
fainter
light
--
into
shapeless
dusk
at
last
.
It
had
an
odd
effect
--
as
*NL*
if
these
few
steps
had
carried
him
out
of
this
concrete
and
perplexed
*NL*
world
.
His
tall
form
,
as
though
robbed
of
its
substance
,
hovered
*NL*
noiselessly
over
invisible
things
with
stooping
and
indefinite
*NL*
movements
;
his
voice
,
heard
in
that
remoteness
where
he
could
be
*NL*
glimpsed
mysteriously
busy
with
immaterial
cares
,
was
no
longer
*NL*
incisive
,
seemed
to
roll
voluminous
and
grave
--
mellowed
by
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
And
because
you
not
always
can
keep
your
eyes
shut
there
comes
the
*NL*
real
trouble
--
the
heart
pain
--
the
world
pain
.
I
tell
you
,
my
friend
,
it
*NL*
is
not
good
for
you
to
find
you
can
not
make
your
dream
come
true
,
for
*NL*
the
reason
that
you
not
strong
enough
are
,
or
not
clever
enough
...
*NL*
Ja
!
...
And
all
the
time
you
are
such
a
fine
fellow
too
!
Wie
?
Was
?
*NL*
Gott
im
Himmel
!
How
can
that
be
?
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
shadow
prowling
amongst
the
graves
of
butterflies
laughed
*NL*
boisterously
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Yes
!
Very
funny
this
terrible
thing
is
.
A
man
that
is
born
falls
into
*NL*
a
dream
like
a
man
who
falls
into
the
sea
.
If
he
tries
to
climb
out
into
*NL*
the
air
as
inexperienced
people
endeavour
to
do
,
he
drowns
--
nicht
wahr
?
*NL*
...
No
!
I
tell
you
!
The
way
is
to
the
destructive
element
submit
*NL*
yourself
,
and
with
the
exertions
of
your
hands
and
feet
in
the
water
*NL*
make
the
deep
,
deep
sea
keep
you
up
.
So
if
you
ask
me
--
how
to
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
voice
leaped
up
extraordinarily
strong
,
as
though
away
there
in
*NL*
the
dusk
he
had
been
inspired
by
some
whisper
of
knowledge
.
``
I
will
tell
*NL*
you
!
For
that
too
there
is
only
one
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
With
a
hasty
swish-swish
of
his
slippers
he
loomed
up
in
the
ring
of
*NL*
faint
light
,
and
suddenly
appeared
in
the
bright
circle
of
the
lamp
.
His
*NL*
extended
hand
aimed
at
my
breast
like
a
pistol
;
his
deepset
eyes
seemed
*NL*
to
pierce
through
me
,
but
his
twitching
lips
uttered
no
word
,
and
the
*NL*
austere
exaltation
of
a
certitude
seen
in
the
dusk
vanished
from
his
*NL*
face
.
The
hand
that
had
been
pointing
at
my
breast
fell
,
and
by-and-by
,
*NL*
coming
a
step
nearer
,
he
laid
it
gently
on
my
shoulder
.
There
were
*NL*
things
,
he
said
mournfully
,
that
perhaps
could
never
be
told
,
only
he
*NL*
had
lived
so
much
alone
that
sometimes
he
forgot
--
he
forgot
.
The
light
*NL*
had
destroyed
the
assurance
which
had
inspired
him
in
the
distant
*NL*
shadows
.
He
sat
down
and
,
with
both
elbows
on
the
desk
,
rubbed
his
*NL*
forehead
.
``
And
yet
it
is
true
--
it
is
true
.
In
the
destructive
element
*NL*
immerse
.
''
...
He
spoke
in
a
subdued
tone
,
without
looking
at
me
,
one
*NL*
hand
on
each
side
of
his
face
.
``
That
was
the
way
.
To
follow
the
dream
,
*NL*
and
again
to
follow
the
dream
--
and
so
--
ewig
--
usque
ad
finem
...
''
The
*NL*
whisper
of
his
conviction
seemed
to
open
before
me
a
vast
and
uncertain
*NL*
expanse
,
as
of
a
crepuscular
horizon
on
a
plain
at
dawn
--
or
was
it
,
*NL*
perchance
,
at
the
coming
of
the
night
?
One
had
not
the
courage
to
*NL*
decide
;
but
it
was
a
charming
and
deceptive
light
,
throwing
the
*NL*
impalpable
poesy
of
its
dimness
over
pitfalls
--
over
graves
.
His
life
had
*NL*
begun
in
sacrifice
,
in
enthusiasm
for
generous
ideas
;
he
had
travelled
*NL*
very
far
,
on
various
ways
,
on
strange
paths
,
and
whatever
he
followed
*NL*
it
had
been
without
faltering
,
and
therefore
without
shame
and
without
*NL*
regret
.
In
so
far
he
was
right
.
That
was
the
way
,
no
doubt
.
Yet
for
all
*NL*
that
,
the
great
plain
on
which
men
wander
amongst
graves
and
pitfalls
*NL*
remained
very
desolate
under
the
impalpable
poesy
of
its
crepuscular
*NL*
light
,
overshadowed
in
the
centre
,
circled
with
a
bright
edge
as
if
*NL*
surrounded
by
an
abyss
full
of
flames
.
When
at
last
I
broke
the
silence
*NL*
it
was
to
express
the
opinion
that
no
one
could
be
more
romantic
than
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shook
his
head
slowly
,
and
afterwards
looked
at
me
with
a
patient
*NL*
and
inquiring
glance
.
It
was
a
shame
,
he
said
.
There
we
were
sitting
*NL*
and
talking
like
two
boys
,
instead
of
putting
our
heads
together
to
find
*NL*
something
practical
--
a
practical
remedy
--
for
the
evil
--
for
the
great
*NL*
evil
--
he
repeated
,
with
a
humorous
and
indulgent
smile
.
For
all
that
,
*NL*
our
talk
did
not
grow
more
practical
.
We
avoided
pronouncing
Jim
's
name
*NL*
as
though
we
had
tried
to
keep
flesh
and
blood
out
of
our
discussion
,
*NL*
or
he
were
nothing
but
an
erring
spirit
,
a
suffering
and
nameless
shade
.
*NL*
``
Na
!
''
said
Stein
,
rising
.
``
To-night
you
sleep
here
,
and
in
the
morning
*NL*
we
shall
do
something
practical
--
practical
...
''
He
lit
a
two-branched
*NL*
candlestick
and
led
the
way
.
We
passed
through
empty
dark
rooms
,
*NL*
escorted
by
gleams
from
the
lights
Stein
carried
.
They
glided
along
the
*NL*
waxed
floors
,
sweeping
here
and
there
over
the
polished
surface
of
*NL*
a
table
,
leaped
upon
a
fragmentary
curve
of
a
piece
of
furniture
,
or
*NL*
flashed
perpendicularly
in
and
out
of
distant
mirrors
,
while
the
forms
*NL*
of
two
men
and
the
flicker
of
two
flames
could
be
seen
for
a
moment
*NL*
stealing
silently
across
the
depths
of
a
crystalline
void
.
He
walked
*NL*
slowly
a
pace
in
advance
with
stooping
courtesy
;
there
was
a
profound
,
*NL*
as
it
were
a
listening
,
quietude
on
his
face
;
the
long
flaxen
locks
*NL*
mixed
with
white
threads
were
scattered
thinly
upon
his
slightly
bowed
*NL*
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
is
romantic
--
romantic
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
And
that
is
very
bad
--
very
*NL*
bad
...
Very
good
,
too
,
''
he
added
.
``
But
_
is
he
_
?
''
I
queried
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Gewiss
,
''
he
said
,
and
stood
still
holding
up
the
candelabrum
,
but
*NL*
without
looking
at
me
.
``
Evident
!
What
is
it
that
by
inward
pain
makes
*NL*
him
know
himself
?
What
is
it
that
for
you
and
me
makes
him
--
exist
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
that
moment
it
was
difficult
to
believe
in
Jim
's
existence
--
starting
*NL*
from
a
country
parsonage
,
blurred
by
crowds
of
men
as
by
clouds
of
*NL*
dust
,
silenced
by
the
clashing
claims
of
life
and
death
in
a
material
*NL*
world
--
but
his
imperishable
reality
came
to
me
with
a
convincing
,
with
*NL*
an
irresistible
force
!
I
saw
it
vividly
,
as
though
in
our
progress
*NL*
through
the
lofty
silent
rooms
amongst
fleeting
gleams
of
light
and
*NL*
the
sudden
revelations
of
human
figures
stealing
with
flickering
flames
*NL*
within
unfathomable
and
pellucid
depths
,
we
had
approached
nearer
to
*NL*
absolute
Truth
,
which
,
like
Beauty
itself
,
floats
elusive
,
obscure
,
half
*NL*
submerged
,
in
the
silent
still
waters
of
mystery
.
``
Perhaps
he
is
,
''
I
*NL*
admitted
with
a
slight
laugh
,
whose
unexpectedly
loud
reverberation
*NL*
made
me
lower
my
voice
directly
;
``
but
I
am
sure
you
are
.
''
With
his
head
*NL*
dropping
on
his
breast
and
the
light
held
high
he
began
to
walk
again
.
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
exist
,
too
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
preceded
me
.
My
eyes
followed
his
movements
,
but
what
I
did
see
was
*NL*
not
the
head
of
the
firm
,
the
welcome
guest
at
afternoon
receptions
,
*NL*
the
correspondent
of
learned
societies
,
the
entertainer
of
stray
*NL*
naturalists
;
I
saw
only
the
reality
of
his
destiny
,
which
he
had
known
*NL*
how
to
follow
with
unfaltering
footsteps
,
that
life
begun
in
humble
*NL*
surroundings
,
rich
in
generous
enthusiasms
,
in
friendship
,
love
,
war
--
in
*NL*
all
the
exalted
elements
of
romance
.
At
the
door
of
my
room
he
faced
me
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
,
as
though
carrying
on
a
discussion
,
``
and
amongst
other
*NL*
things
you
dreamed
foolishly
of
a
certain
butterfly
;
but
when
one
*NL*
fine
morning
your
dream
came
in
your
way
you
did
not
let
the
splendid
*NL*
opportunity
escape
.
Did
you
?
Whereas
he
...
''
Stein
lifted
his
hand
.
*NL*
``
And
do
you
know
how
many
opportunities
I
let
escape
;
how
many
dreams
*NL*
I
had
lost
that
had
come
in
my
way
?
''
He
shook
his
head
regretfully
.
``
It
*NL*
seems
to
me
that
some
would
have
been
very
fine
--
if
I
had
made
them
come
*NL*
true
.
Do
you
know
how
many
?
Perhaps
I
myself
do
n't
know
.
''
``
Whether
his
*NL*
were
fine
or
not
,
''
I
said
,
``
he
knows
of
one
which
he
certainly
did
not
*NL*
catch
.
''
``
Everybody
knows
of
one
or
two
like
that

''
said
Stein
;
``
and
that
*NL*
is
the
trouble
--
the
great
trouble

''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
shook
hands
on
the
threshold
,
peered
into
my
room
under
his
*NL*
raised
arm
.
``
Sleep
well
.
And
to-morrow
we
must
do
something
*NL*
practical
--
practical
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Though
his
own
room
was
beyond
mine
I
saw
him
return
the
way
he
came
.
*NL*
He
was
going
back
to
his
butterflies

*NL*
'
I
do
n't
suppose
any
of
you
have
ever
heard
of
Patusan
?
'
Marlow
resumed
,
*NL*
after
a
silence
occupied
in
the
careful
lighting
of
a
cigar
.
`
It
does
*NL*
not
matter
;
there
's
many
a
heavenly
body
in
the
lot
crowding
upon
us
of
*NL*
a
night
that
mankind
had
never
heard
of
,
it
being
outside
the
sphere
*NL*
of
its
activities
and
of
no
earthly
importance
to
anybody
but
to
the
*NL*
astronomers
who
are
paid
to
talk
learnedly
about
its
composition
,
*NL*
weight
,
path
--
the
irregularities
of
its
conduct
,
the
aberrations
of
its
*NL*
light
--
a
sort
of
scientific
scandal-mongering
.
Thus
with
Patusan
.
It
*NL*
was
referred
to
knowingly
in
the
inner
government
circles
in
Batavia
,
*NL*
especially
as
to
its
irregularities
and
aberrations
,
and
it
was
known
*NL*
by
name
to
some
few
,
very
few
,
in
the
mercantile
world
.
Nobody
,
however
,
*NL*
had
been
there
,
and
I
suspect
no
one
desired
to
go
there
in
person
,
*NL*
just
as
an
astronomer
,
I
should
fancy
,
would
strongly
object
to
being
*NL*
transported
into
a
distant
heavenly
body
,
where
,
parted
from
his
earthly
*NL*
emoluments
,
he
would
be
bewildered
by
the
view
of
an
unfamiliar
heavens
.
*NL*
However
,
neither
heavenly
bodies
nor
astronomers
have
anything
to
do
*NL*
with
Patusan
.
It
was
Jim
who
went
there
.
I
only
meant
you
to
understand
*NL*
that
had
Stein
arranged
to
send
him
into
a
star
of
the
fifth
magnitude
*NL*
the
change
could
not
have
been
greater
.
He
left
his
earthly
failings
*NL*
behind
him
and
what
sort
of
reputation
he
had
,
and
there
was
a
totally
*NL*
new
set
of
conditions
for
his
imaginative
faculty
to
work
upon
.
Entirely
*NL*
new
,
entirely
remarkable
.
And
he
got
hold
of
them
in
a
remarkable
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stein
was
the
man
who
knew
more
about
Patusan
than
anybody
else
.
More
*NL*
than
was
known
in
the
government
circles
I
suspect
.
I
have
no
doubt
he
*NL*
had
been
there
,
either
in
his
butterfly-hunting
days
or
later
on
,
when
*NL*
he
tried
in
his
incorrigible
way
to
season
with
a
pinch
of
romance
the
*NL*
fattening
dishes
of
his
commercial
kitchen
.
There
were
very
few
places
*NL*
in
the
Archipelago
he
had
not
seen
in
the
original
dusk
of
their
being
,
*NL*
before
light
-LRB-
and
even
electric
light
-RRB-
had
been
carried
into
them
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
better
morality
and
--
and
--
well
--
the
greater
profit
,
too
.
*NL*
It
was
at
breakfast
of
the
morning
following
our
talk
about
Jim
that
he
*NL*
mentioned
the
place
,
after
I
had
quoted
poor
Brierly
's
remark
:
``
Let
him
*NL*
creep
twenty
feet
underground
and
stay
there
.
''
He
looked
up
at
me
with
*NL*
interested
attention
,
as
though
I
had
been
a
rare
insect
.
``
This
could
be
*NL*
done
,
too
,
''
he
remarked
,
sipping
his
coffee
.
``
Bury
him
in
some
sort
,
''
*NL*
I
explained
.
``
One
does
n't
like
to
do
it
of
course
,
but
it
would
be
the
*NL*
best
thing
,
seeing
what
he
is
.
''
``
Yes
;
he
is
young
,
''
Stein
mused
.
``
The
*NL*
youngest
human
being
now
in
existence
,
''
I
affirmed
.
``
Schon
.
There
's
*NL*
Patusan
,
''
he
went
on
in
the
same
tone
...
``
And
the
woman
is
dead
*NL*
now
,
''
he
added
incomprehensibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Of
course
I
do
n't
know
that
story
;
I
can
only
guess
that
once
before
*NL*
Patusan
had
been
used
as
a
grave
for
some
sin
,
transgression
,
or
*NL*
misfortune
.
It
is
impossible
to
suspect
Stein
.
The
only
woman
that
*NL*
had
ever
existed
for
him
was
the
Malay
girl
he
called
``
My
wife
the
*NL*
princess
,
''
or
,
more
rarely
,
in
moments
of
expansion
,
``
the
mother
of
my
*NL*
Emma
.
''
Who
was
the
woman
he
had
mentioned
in
connection
with
Patusan
I
*NL*
ca
n't
say
;
but
from
his
allusions
I
understand
she
had
been
an
educated
*NL*
and
very
good-looking
Dutch-Malay
girl
,
with
a
tragic
or
perhaps
only
a
*NL*
pitiful
history
,
whose
most
painful
part
no
doubt
was
her
marriage
with
*NL*
a
Malacca
Portuguese
who
had
been
clerk
in
some
commercial
house
in
*NL*
the
Dutch
colonies
.
I
gathered
from
Stein
that
this
man
was
an
*NL*
unsatisfactory
person
in
more
ways
than
one
,
all
being
more
or
less
*NL*
indefinite
and
offensive
.
It
was
solely
for
his
wife
's
sake
that
Stein
*NL*
had
appointed
him
manager
of
Stein
&
Co.
's
trading
post
in
Patusan
;
*NL*
but
commercially
the
arrangement
was
not
a
success
,
at
any
rate
for
*NL*
the
firm
,
and
now
the
woman
had
died
,
Stein
was
disposed
to
try
another
*NL*
agent
there
.
The
Portuguese
,
whose
name
was
Cornelius
,
considered
*NL*
himself
a
very
deserving
but
ill-used
person
,
entitled
by
his
abilities
*NL*
to
a
better
position
.
This
man
Jim
would
have
to
relieve
.
``
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
think
he
will
go
away
from
the
place
,
''
remarked
Stein
.
``
That
has
nothing
*NL*
to
do
with
me
.
It
was
only
for
the
sake
of
the
woman
that
I
...
But
as
*NL*
I
think
there
is
a
daughter
left
,
I
shall
let
him
,
if
he
likes
to
stay
,
*NL*
keep
the
old
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Patusan
is
a
remote
district
of
a
native-ruled
state
,
and
the
chief
*NL*
settlement
bears
the
same
name
.
At
a
point
on
the
river
about
forty
*NL*
miles
from
the
sea
,
where
the
first
houses
come
into
view
,
there
can
*NL*
be
seen
rising
above
the
level
of
the
forests
the
summits
of
two
steep
*NL*
hills
very
close
together
,
and
separated
by
what
looks
like
a
deep
*NL*
fissure
,
the
cleavage
of
some
mighty
stroke
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
the
*NL*
valley
between
is
nothing
but
a
narrow
ravine
;
the
appearance
from
the
*NL*
settlement
is
of
one
irregularly
conical
hill
split
in
two
,
and
with
the
*NL*
two
halves
leaning
slightly
apart
.
On
the
third
day
after
the
full
,
the
*NL*
moon
,
as
seen
from
the
open
space
in
front
of
Jim
's
house
-LRB-
he
had
a
very
*NL*
fine
house
in
the
native
style
when
I
visited
him
-RRB-
,
rose
exactly
behind
*NL*
these
hills
,
its
diffused
light
at
first
throwing
the
two
masses
into
*NL*
intensely
black
relief
,
and
then
the
nearly
perfect
disc
,
glowing
*NL*
ruddily
,
appeared
,
gliding
upwards
between
the
sides
of
the
chasm
,
till
*NL*
it
floated
away
above
the
summits
,
as
if
escaping
from
a
yawning
grave
*NL*
in
gentle
triumph
.
``
Wonderful
effect
,
''
said
Jim
by
my
side
.
``
Worth
*NL*
seeing
.
Is
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
this
question
was
put
with
a
note
of
personal
pride
that
made
me
*NL*
smile
,
as
though
he
had
had
a
hand
in
regulating
that
unique
spectacle
.
*NL*
He
had
regulated
so
many
things
in
Patusan
--
things
that
would
have
*NL*
appeared
as
much
beyond
his
control
as
the
motions
of
the
moon
and
the
*NL*
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
inconceivable
.
That
was
the
distinctive
quality
of
the
part
into
*NL*
which
Stein
and
I
had
tumbled
him
unwittingly
,
with
no
other
notion
than
*NL*
to
get
him
out
of
the
way
;
out
of
his
own
way
,
be
it
understood
.
That
*NL*
was
our
main
purpose
,
though
,
I
own
,
I
might
have
had
another
motive
*NL*
which
had
influenced
me
a
little
.
I
was
about
to
go
home
for
a
time
;
*NL*
and
it
may
be
I
desired
,
more
than
I
was
aware
of
myself
,
to
dispose
of
*NL*
him
--
to
dispose
of
him
,
you
understand
--
before
I
left
.
I
was
going
home
,
*NL*
and
he
had
come
to
me
from
there
,
with
his
miserable
trouble
and
his
*NL*
shadowy
claim
,
like
a
man
panting
under
a
burden
in
a
mist
.
I
can
not
*NL*
say
I
had
ever
seen
him
distinctly
--
not
even
to
this
day
,
after
I
had
*NL*
my
last
view
of
him
;
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
less
I
understood
*NL*
the
more
I
was
bound
to
him
in
the
name
of
that
doubt
which
is
the
*NL*
inseparable
part
of
our
knowledge
.
I
did
not
know
so
much
more
about
*NL*
myself
.
And
then
,
I
repeat
,
I
was
going
home
--
to
that
home
distant
*NL*
enough
for
all
its
hearthstones
to
be
like
one
hearthstone
,
by
which
the
*NL*
humblest
of
us
has
the
right
to
sit
.
We
wander
in
our
thousands
over
the
*NL*
face
of
the
earth
,
the
illustrious
and
the
obscure
,
earning
beyond
the
*NL*
seas
our
fame
,
our
money
,
or
only
a
crust
of
bread
;
but
it
seems
to
me
*NL*
that
for
each
of
us
going
home
must
be
like
going
to
render
an
account
.
*NL*
We
return
to
face
our
superiors
,
our
kindred
,
our
friends
--
those
whom
we
*NL*
obey
,
and
those
whom
we
love
;
but
even
they
who
have
neither
,
the
most
*NL*
free
,
lonely
,
irresponsible
and
bereft
of
ties
,
--
even
those
for
whom
*NL*
home
holds
no
dear
face
,
no
familiar
voice
,
--
even
they
have
to
meet
the
*NL*
spirit
that
dwells
within
the
land
,
under
its
sky
,
in
its
air
,
in
its
*NL*
valleys
,
and
on
its
rises
,
in
its
fields
,
in
its
waters
and
its
trees
--
a
*NL*
mute
friend
,
judge
,
and
inspirer
.
Say
what
you
like
,
to
get
its
joy
,
*NL*
to
breathe
its
peace
,
to
face
its
truth
,
one
must
return
with
a
clear
*NL*
conscience
.
All
this
may
seem
to
you
sheer
sentimentalism
;
and
indeed
*NL*
very
few
of
us
have
the
will
or
the
capacity
to
look
consciously
under
*NL*
the
surface
of
familiar
emotions
.
There
are
the
girls
we
love
,
the
men
*NL*
we
look
up
to
,
the
tenderness
,
the
friendships
,
the
opportunities
,
the
*NL*
pleasures
!
But
the
fact
remains
that
you
must
touch
your
reward
with
*NL*
clean
hands
,
lest
it
turn
to
dead
leaves
,
to
thorns
,
in
your
grasp
.
I
*NL*
think
it
is
the
lonely
,
without
a
fireside
or
an
affection
they
may
call
*NL*
their
own
,
those
who
return
not
to
a
dwelling
but
to
the
land
itself
,
to
*NL*
meet
its
disembodied
,
eternal
,
and
unchangeable
spirit
--
it
is
those
who
*NL*
understand
best
its
severity
,
its
saving
power
,
the
grace
of
its
secular
*NL*
right
to
our
fidelity
,
to
our
obedience
.
Yes
!
few
of
us
understand
,
but
*NL*
we
all
feel
it
though
,
and
I
say
_
all
_
without
exception
,
because
those
*NL*
who
do
not
feel
do
not
count
.
Each
blade
of
grass
has
its
spot
on
earth
*NL*
whence
it
draws
its
life
,
its
strength
;
and
so
is
man
rooted
to
the
land
*NL*
from
which
he
draws
his
faith
together
with
his
life
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
how
much
Jim
understood
;
but
I
know
he
felt
,
he
felt
confusedly
but
*NL*
powerfully
,
the
demand
of
some
such
truth
or
some
such
illusion
--
I
do
n't
*NL*
care
how
you
call
it
,
there
is
so
little
difference
,
and
the
difference
*NL*
means
so
little
.
The
thing
is
that
in
virtue
of
his
feeling
he
mattered
.
*NL*
He
would
never
go
home
now
.
Not
he
.
Never
.
Had
he
been
capable
of
*NL*
picturesque
manifestations
he
would
have
shuddered
at
the
thought
*NL*
and
made
you
shudder
too
.
But
he
was
not
of
that
sort
,
though
he
was
*NL*
expressive
enough
in
his
way
.
Before
the
idea
of
going
home
he
would
*NL*
grow
desperately
stiff
and
immovable
,
with
lowered
chin
and
pouted
lips
,
*NL*
and
with
those
candid
blue
eyes
of
his
glowering
darkly
under
a
frown
,
*NL*
as
if
before
something
unbearable
,
as
if
before
something
revolting
.
*NL*
There
was
imagination
in
that
hard
skull
of
his
,
over
which
the
thick
*NL*
clustering
hair
fitted
like
a
cap
.
As
to
me
,
I
have
no
imagination
-LRB-
I
*NL*
would
be
more
certain
about
him
today
,
if
I
had
-RRB-
,
and
I
do
not
mean
to
*NL*
imply
that
I
figured
to
myself
the
spirit
of
the
land
uprising
above
the
*NL*
white
cliffs
of
Dover
,
to
ask
me
what
I
--
returning
with
no
bones
broken
,
*NL*
so
to
speak
--
had
done
with
my
very
young
brother
.
I
could
not
make
*NL*
such
a
mistake
.
I
knew
very
well
he
was
of
those
about
whom
there
is
*NL*
no
inquiry
;
I
had
seen
better
men
go
out
,
disappear
,
vanish
utterly
,
*NL*
without
provoking
a
sound
of
curiosity
or
sorrow
.
The
spirit
of
*NL*
the
land
,
as
becomes
the
ruler
of
great
enterprises
,
is
careless
of
*NL*
innumerable
lives
.
Woe
to
the
stragglers
!
We
exist
only
in
so
far
as
we
*NL*
hang
together
.
He
had
straggled
in
a
way
;
he
had
not
hung
on
;
but
he
was
*NL*
aware
of
it
with
an
intensity
that
made
him
touching
,
just
as
a
man
's
*NL*
more
intense
life
makes
his
death
more
touching
than
the
death
of
a
*NL*
tree
.
I
happened
to
be
handy
,
and
I
happened
to
be
touched
.
That
's
all
*NL*
there
is
to
it
.
I
was
concerned
as
to
the
way
he
would
go
out
.
It
would
*NL*
have
hurt
me
if
,
for
instance
,
he
had
taken
to
drink
.
The
earth
is
so
*NL*
small
that
I
was
afraid
of
,
some
day
,
being
waylaid
by
a
blear-eyed
,
*NL*
swollen-faced
,
besmirched
loafer
,
with
no
soles
to
his
canvas
shoes
,
*NL*
and
with
a
flutter
of
rags
about
the
elbows
,
who
,
on
the
strength
of
old
*NL*
acquaintance
,
would
ask
for
a
loan
of
five
dollars
.
You
know
the
awful
*NL*
jaunty
bearing
of
these
scarecrows
coming
to
you
from
a
decent
past
,
*NL*
the
rasping
careless
voice
,
the
half-averted
impudent
glances
--
those
*NL*
meetings
more
trying
to
a
man
who
believes
in
the
solidarity
of
our
*NL*
lives
than
the
sight
of
an
impenitent
death-bed
to
a
priest
.
That
,
to
*NL*
tell
you
the
truth
,
was
the
only
danger
I
could
see
for
him
and
for
*NL*
me
;
but
I
also
mistrusted
my
want
of
imagination
.
It
might
even
come
*NL*
to
something
worse
,
in
some
way
it
was
beyond
my
powers
of
fancy
to
*NL*
foresee
.
He
would
n't
let
me
forget
how
imaginative
he
was
,
and
your
*NL*
imaginative
people
swing
farther
in
any
direction
,
as
if
given
a
longer
*NL*
scope
of
cable
in
the
uneasy
anchorage
of
life
.
They
do
.
They
take
to
*NL*
drink
too
.
It
may
be
I
was
belittling
him
by
such
a
fear
.
How
could
I
*NL*
tell
?
Even
Stein
could
say
no
more
than
that
he
was
romantic
.
I
only
*NL*
knew
he
was
one
of
us
.
And
what
business
had
he
to
be
romantic
?
I
*NL*
am
telling
you
so
much
about
my
own
instinctive
feelings
and
bemused
*NL*
reflections
because
there
remains
so
little
to
be
told
of
him
.
He
*NL*
existed
for
me
,
and
after
all
it
is
only
through
me
that
he
exists
for
*NL*
you
.
I
've
led
him
out
by
the
hand
;
I
have
paraded
him
before
you
.
Were
*NL*
my
commonplace
fears
unjust
?
I
wo
n't
say
--
not
even
now
.
You
may
be
able
*NL*
to
tell
better
,
since
the
proverb
has
it
that
the
onlookers
see
most
of
*NL*
the
game
.
At
any
rate
,
they
were
superfluous
.
He
did
not
go
out
,
not
at
*NL*
all
;
on
the
contrary
,
he
came
on
wonderfully
,
came
on
straight
as
a
die
*NL*
and
in
excellent
form
,
which
showed
that
he
could
stay
as
well
as
spurt
.
*NL*
I
ought
to
be
delighted
,
for
it
is
a
victory
in
which
I
had
taken
my
*NL*
part
;
but
I
am
not
so
pleased
as
I
would
have
expected
to
be
.
I
ask
*NL*
myself
whether
his
rush
had
really
carried
him
out
of
that
mist
in
*NL*
which
he
loomed
interesting
if
not
very
big
,
with
floating
outlines
--
a
*NL*
straggler
yearning
inconsolably
for
his
humble
place
in
the
ranks
.
And
*NL*
besides
,
the
last
word
is
not
said
,
--
probably
shall
never
be
said
.
Are
*NL*
not
our
lives
too
short
for
that
full
utterance
which
through
all
our
*NL*
stammerings
is
of
course
our
only
and
abiding
intention
?
I
have
given
*NL*
up
expecting
those
last
words
,
whose
ring
,
if
they
could
only
be
*NL*
pronounced
,
would
shake
both
heaven
and
earth
.
There
is
never
time
to
*NL*
say
our
last
word
--
the
last
word
of
our
love
,
of
our
desire
,
faith
,
*NL*
remorse
,
submissions
,
revolt
.
The
heaven
and
the
earth
must
not
be
*NL*
shaken
,
I
suppose
--
at
least
,
not
by
us
who
know
so
many
truths
about
*NL*
either
.
My
last
words
about
Jim
shall
be
few
.
I
affirm
he
had
achieved
*NL*
greatness
;
but
the
thing
would
be
dwarfed
in
the
telling
,
or
rather
in
*NL*
the
hearing
.
Frankly
,
it
is
not
my
words
that
I
mistrust
but
your
minds
.
*NL*
I
could
be
eloquent
were
I
not
afraid
you
fellows
had
starved
your
*NL*
imaginations
to
feed
your
bodies
.
I
do
not
mean
to
be
offensive
;
it
is
*NL*
respectable
to
have
no
illusions
--
and
safe
--
and
profitable
--
and
dull
.
*NL*
Yet
you
,
too
,
in
your
time
must
have
known
the
intensity
of
life
,
that
*NL*
light
of
glamour
created
in
the
shock
of
trifles
,
as
amazing
as
the
glow
*NL*
of
sparks
struck
from
a
cold
stone
--
and
as
short-lived
,
alas
!

CHAPTER
22
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
conquest
of
love
,
honour
,
men
's
confidence
--
the
pride
of
it
,
the
*NL*
power
of
it
,
are
fit
materials
for
a
heroic
tale
;
only
our
minds
are
*NL*
struck
by
the
externals
of
such
a
success
,
and
to
Jim
's
successes
there
*NL*
were
no
externals
.
Thirty
miles
of
forest
shut
it
off
from
the
sight
of
*NL*
an
indifferent
world
,
and
the
noise
of
the
white
surf
along
the
coast
*NL*
overpowered
the
voice
of
fame
.
The
stream
of
civilisation
,
as
if
divided
*NL*
on
a
headland
a
hundred
miles
north
of
Patusan
,
branches
east
and
*NL*
south-east
,
leaving
its
plains
and
valleys
,
its
old
trees
and
its
old
*NL*
mankind
,
neglected
and
isolated
,
such
as
an
insignificant
and
crumbling
*NL*
islet
between
the
two
branches
of
a
mighty
,
devouring
stream
.
You
find
*NL*
the
name
of
the
country
pretty
often
in
collections
of
old
voyages
.
The
*NL*
seventeenth-century
traders
went
there
for
pepper
,
because
the
passion
*NL*
for
pepper
seemed
to
burn
like
a
flame
of
love
in
the
breast
of
Dutch
*NL*
and
English
adventurers
about
the
time
of
James
the
First
.
Where
*NL*
would
n't
they
go
for
pepper
!
For
a
bag
of
pepper
they
would
cut
each
*NL*
other
's
throats
without
hesitation
,
and
would
forswear
their
souls
,
*NL*
of
which
they
were
so
careful
otherwise
:
the
bizarre
obstinacy
of
that
*NL*
desire
made
them
defy
death
in
a
thousand
shapes
--
the
unknown
seas
,
the
*NL*
loathsome
and
strange
diseases
;
wounds
,
captivity
,
hunger
,
pestilence
,
*NL*
and
despair
.
It
made
them
great
!
By
heavens
!
it
made
them
heroic
;
and
*NL*
it
made
them
pathetic
too
in
their
craving
for
trade
with
the
inflexible
*NL*
death
levying
its
toll
on
young
and
old
.
It
seems
impossible
to
believe
*NL*
that
mere
greed
could
hold
men
to
such
a
steadfastness
of
purpose
,
to
*NL*
such
a
blind
persistence
in
endeavour
and
sacrifice
.
And
indeed
those
*NL*
who
adventured
their
persons
and
lives
risked
all
they
had
for
a
slender
*NL*
reward
.
They
left
their
bones
to
lie
bleaching
on
distant
shores
,
so
*NL*
that
wealth
might
flow
to
the
living
at
home
.
To
us
,
their
less
tried
*NL*
successors
,
they
appear
magnified
,
not
as
agents
of
trade
but
as
*NL*
instruments
of
a
recorded
destiny
,
pushing
out
into
the
unknown
in
*NL*
obedience
to
an
inward
voice
,
to
an
impulse
beating
in
the
blood
,
to
a
*NL*
dream
of
the
future
.
They
were
wonderful
;
and
it
must
be
owned
they
*NL*
were
ready
for
the
wonderful
.
They
recorded
it
complacently
in
their
*NL*
sufferings
,
in
the
aspect
of
the
seas
,
in
the
customs
of
strange
*NL*
nations
,
in
the
glory
of
splendid
rulers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
Patusan
they
had
found
lots
of
pepper
,
and
had
been
impressed
by
the
*NL*
magnificence
and
the
wisdom
of
the
Sultan
;
but
somehow
,
after
a
century
*NL*
of
chequered
intercourse
,
the
country
seems
to
drop
gradually
out
of
the
*NL*
trade
.
Perhaps
the
pepper
had
given
out
.
Be
it
as
it
may
,
nobody
cares
*NL*
for
it
now
;
the
glory
has
departed
,
the
Sultan
is
an
imbecile
youth
*NL*
with
two
thumbs
on
his
left
hand
and
an
uncertain
and
beggarly
revenue
*NL*
extorted
from
a
miserable
population
and
stolen
from
him
by
his
many
*NL*
uncles
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
of
course
I
have
from
Stein
.
He
gave
me
their
names
and
a
short
*NL*
sketch
of
the
life
and
character
of
each
.
He
was
as
full
of
information
*NL*
about
native
states
as
an
official
report
,
but
infinitely
more
amusing
.
*NL*
He
_
had
_
to
know
.
He
traded
in
so
many
,
and
in
some
districts
--
as
in
*NL*
Patusan
,
for
instance
--
his
firm
was
the
only
one
to
have
an
agency
by
*NL*
special
permit
from
the
Dutch
authorities
.
The
Government
trusted
his
*NL*
discretion
,
and
it
was
understood
that
he
took
all
the
risks
.
The
men
*NL*
he
employed
understood
that
too
,
but
he
made
it
worth
their
while
*NL*
apparently
.
He
was
perfectly
frank
with
me
over
the
breakfast-table
in
*NL*
the
morning
.
As
far
as
he
was
aware
-LRB-
the
last
news
was
thirteen
months
*NL*
old
,
he
stated
precisely
-RRB-
,
utter
insecurity
for
life
and
property
was
*NL*
the
normal
condition
.
There
were
in
Patusan
antagonistic
forces
,
and
one
*NL*
of
them
was
Rajah
Allang
,
the
worst
of
the
Sultan
's
uncles
,
the
governor
*NL*
of
the
river
,
who
did
the
extorting
and
the
stealing
,
and
ground
down
*NL*
to
the
point
of
extinction
the
country-born
Malays
,
who
,
utterly
*NL*
defenceless
,
had
not
even
the
resource
of
emigrating
--
``
For
indeed
,
''
as
*NL*
Stein
remarked
,
``
where
could
they
go
,
and
how
could
they
get
away
?
''
*NL*
No
doubt
they
did
not
even
desire
to
get
away
.
The
world
-LRB-
which
is
*NL*
circumscribed
by
lofty
impassable
mountains
-RRB-
has
been
given
into
the
*NL*
hand
of
the
high-born
,
and
_
this
_
Rajah
they
knew
:
he
was
of
their
own
*NL*
royal
house
.
I
had
the
pleasure
of
meeting
the
gentleman
later
on
.
He
*NL*
was
a
dirty
,
little
,
used-up
old
man
with
evil
eyes
and
a
weak
mouth
,
*NL*
who
swallowed
an
opium
pill
every
two
hours
,
and
in
defiance
of
common
*NL*
decency
wore
his
hair
uncovered
and
falling
in
wild
stringy
locks
about
*NL*
his
wizened
grimy
face
.
When
giving
audience
he
would
clamber
upon
a
*NL*
sort
of
narrow
stage
erected
in
a
hall
like
a
ruinous
barn
with
a
rotten
*NL*
bamboo
floor
,
through
the
cracks
of
which
you
could
see
,
twelve
or
*NL*
fifteen
feet
below
,
the
heaps
of
refuse
and
garbage
of
all
kinds
lying
*NL*
under
the
house
.
That
is
where
and
how
he
received
us
when
,
accompanied
*NL*
by
Jim
,
I
paid
him
a
visit
of
ceremony
.
There
were
about
forty
people
in
*NL*
the
room
,
and
perhaps
three
times
as
many
in
the
great
courtyard
below
.
*NL*
There
was
constant
movement
,
coming
and
going
,
pushing
and
murmuring
,
*NL*
at
our
backs
.
A
few
youths
in
gay
silks
glared
from
the
distance
;
the
*NL*
majority
,
slaves
and
humble
dependants
,
were
half
naked
,
in
ragged
*NL*
sarongs
,
dirty
with
ashes
and
mud-stains
.
I
had
never
seen
Jim
look
so
*NL*
grave
,
so
self-possessed
,
in
an
impenetrable
,
impressive
way
.
In
the
*NL*
midst
of
these
dark-faced
men
,
his
stalwart
figure
in
white
apparel
,
*NL*
the
gleaming
clusters
of
his
fair
hair
,
seemed
to
catch
all
the
sunshine
*NL*
that
trickled
through
the
cracks
in
the
closed
shutters
of
that
dim
*NL*
hall
,
with
its
walls
of
mats
and
a
roof
of
thatch
.
He
appeared
like
a
*NL*
creature
not
only
of
another
kind
but
of
another
essence
.
Had
they
not
*NL*
seen
him
come
up
in
a
canoe
they
might
have
thought
he
had
descended
*NL*
upon
them
from
the
clouds
.
He
did
,
however
,
come
in
a
crazy
dug-out
,
*NL*
sitting
-LRB-
very
still
and
with
his
knees
together
,
for
fear
of
overturning
*NL*
the
thing
-RRB-
--
sitting
on
a
tin
box
--
which
I
had
lent
him
--
nursing
on
his
*NL*
lap
a
revolver
of
the
Navy
pattern
--
presented
by
me
on
parting
--
which
,
*NL*
through
an
interposition
of
Providence
,
or
through
some
wrong-headed
*NL*
notion
,
that
was
just
like
him
,
or
else
from
sheer
instinctive
sagacity
,
*NL*
he
had
decided
to
carry
unloaded
.
That
's
how
he
ascended
the
Patusan
*NL*
river
.
Nothing
could
have
been
more
prosaic
and
more
unsafe
,
more
*NL*
extravagantly
casual
,
more
lonely
.
Strange
,
this
fatality
that
would
*NL*
cast
the
complexion
of
a
flight
upon
all
his
acts
,
of
impulsive
*NL*
unreflecting
desertion
of
a
jump
into
the
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
precisely
the
casualness
of
it
that
strikes
me
most
.
Neither
*NL*
Stein
nor
I
had
a
clear
conception
of
what
might
be
on
the
other
side
*NL*
when
we
,
metaphorically
speaking
,
took
him
up
and
hove
him
over
the
*NL*
wall
with
scant
ceremony
.
At
the
moment
I
merely
wished
to
achieve
his
*NL*
disappearance
;
Stein
characteristically
enough
had
a
sentimental
motive
.
*NL*
He
had
a
notion
of
paying
off
-LRB-
in
kind
,
I
suppose
-RRB-
the
old
debt
he
had
*NL*
never
forgotten
.
Indeed
he
had
been
all
his
life
especially
friendly
to
*NL*
anybody
from
the
British
Isles
.
His
late
benefactor
,
it
is
true
,
was
a
*NL*
Scot
--
even
to
the
length
of
being
called
Alexander
McNeil
--
and
Jim
came
*NL*
from
a
long
way
south
of
the
Tweed
;
but
at
the
distance
of
six
or
*NL*
seven
thousand
miles
Great
Britain
,
though
never
diminished
,
looks
*NL*
foreshortened
enough
even
to
its
own
children
to
rob
such
details
of
*NL*
their
importance
.
Stein
was
excusable
,
and
his
hinted
intentions
were
*NL*
so
generous
that
I
begged
him
most
earnestly
to
keep
them
secret
for
*NL*
a
time
.
I
felt
that
no
consideration
of
personal
advantage
should
be
*NL*
allowed
to
influence
Jim
;
that
not
even
the
risk
of
such
influence
*NL*
should
be
run
.
We
had
to
deal
with
another
sort
of
reality
.
He
wanted
*NL*
a
refuge
,
and
a
refuge
at
the
cost
of
danger
should
be
offered
*NL*
him
--
nothing
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Upon
every
other
point
I
was
perfectly
frank
with
him
,
and
I
even
-LRB-
as
*NL*
I
believed
at
the
time
-RRB-
exaggerated
the
danger
of
the
undertaking
.
As
*NL*
a
matter
of
fact
I
did
not
do
it
justice
;
his
first
day
in
Patusan
was
*NL*
nearly
his
last
--
would
have
been
his
last
if
he
had
not
been
so
reckless
*NL*
or
so
hard
on
himself
and
had
condescended
to
load
that
revolver
.
I
*NL*
remember
,
as
I
unfolded
our
precious
scheme
for
his
retreat
,
how
his
*NL*
stubborn
but
weary
resignation
was
gradually
replaced
by
surprise
,
*NL*
interest
,
wonder
,
and
by
boyish
eagerness
.
This
was
a
chance
he
had
been
*NL*
dreaming
of
.
He
could
n't
think
how
he
merited
that
I
...
He
would
be
*NL*
shot
if
he
could
see
to
what
he
owed
...
And
it
was
Stein
,
Stein
the
*NL*
merchant
,
who
...
but
of
course
it
was
me
he
had
to
...
I
cut
him
*NL*
short
.
He
was
not
articulate
,
and
his
gratitude
caused
me
inexplicable
*NL*
pain
.
I
told
him
that
if
he
owed
this
chance
to
any
one
especially
,
it
*NL*
was
to
an
old
Scot
of
whom
he
had
never
heard
,
who
had
died
many
years
*NL*
ago
,
of
whom
little
was
remembered
besides
a
roaring
voice
and
a
rough
*NL*
sort
of
honesty
.
There
was
really
no
one
to
receive
his
thanks
.
Stein
*NL*
was
passing
on
to
a
young
man
the
help
he
had
received
in
his
own
young
*NL*
days
,
and
I
had
done
no
more
than
to
mention
his
name
.
Upon
this
he
*NL*
coloured
,
and
,
twisting
a
bit
of
paper
in
his
fingers
,
he
remarked
*NL*
bashfully
that
I
had
always
trusted
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
admitted
that
such
was
the
case
,
and
added
after
a
pause
that
I
*NL*
wished
he
had
been
able
to
follow
my
example
.
``
You
think
I
do
n't
?
''
he
*NL*
asked
uneasily
,
and
remarked
in
a
mutter
that
one
had
to
get
some
sort
*NL*
of
show
first
;
then
brightening
up
,
and
in
a
loud
voice
he
protested
he
*NL*
would
give
me
no
occasion
to
regret
my
confidence
,
which
--
which
...
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Do
not
misapprehend
,
''
I
interrupted
.
``
It
is
not
in
your
power
to
make
*NL*
me
regret
anything
.
''
There
would
be
no
regrets
;
but
if
there
were
,
it
*NL*
would
be
altogether
my
own
affair
:
on
the
other
hand
,
I
wished
him
to
*NL*
understand
clearly
that
this
arrangement
,
this
--
this
--
experiment
,
was
*NL*
his
own
doing
;
he
was
responsible
for
it
and
no
one
else
.
``
Why
?
Why
,
''
he
*NL*
stammered
,
``
this
is
the
very
thing
that
I
...
''
I
begged
him
not
to
*NL*
be
dense
,
and
he
looked
more
puzzled
than
ever
.
He
was
in
a
fair
way
*NL*
to
make
life
intolerable
to
himself
...
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
he
asked
,
*NL*
disturbed
;
but
in
a
moment
added
confidently
,
``
I
was
going
on
though
.
*NL*
Was
I
not
?
''
It
was
impossible
to
be
angry
with
him
:
I
could
not
help
a
*NL*
smile
,
and
told
him
that
in
the
old
days
people
who
went
on
like
*NL*
this
were
on
the
way
of
becoming
hermits
in
a
wilderness
.
``
Hermits
be
*NL*
hanged
!
''
he
commented
with
engaging
impulsiveness
.
Of
course
he
did
n't
*NL*
mind
a
wilderness
...
``
I
was
glad
of
it
,
''
I
said
.
That
was
where
*NL*
he
would
be
going
to
.
He
would
find
it
lively
enough
,
I
ventured
to
*NL*
promise
.
``
Yes
,
yes
,
''
he
said
,
keenly
.
He
had
shown
a
desire
,
I
continued
*NL*
inflexibly
,
to
go
out
and
shut
the
door
after
him
...
``
Did
I
?
''
he
*NL*
interrupted
in
a
strange
access
of
gloom
that
seemed
to
envelop
him
*NL*
from
head
to
foot
like
the
shadow
of
a
passing
cloud
.
He
was
wonderfully
*NL*
expressive
after
all
.
Wonderfully
!
``
Did
I
?
''
he
repeated
bitterly
.
``
You
*NL*
ca
n't
say
I
made
much
noise
about
it
.
And
I
can
keep
it
up
,
too
--
only
,
*NL*
confound
it
!
you
show
me
a
door
.
''
...
``
Very
well
.
Pass
on
,
''
I
struck
*NL*
in
.
I
could
make
him
a
solemn
promise
that
it
would
be
shut
behind
him
*NL*
with
a
vengeance
.
His
fate
,
whatever
it
was
,
would
be
ignored
,
*NL*
because
the
country
,
for
all
its
rotten
state
,
was
not
judged
ripe
*NL*
for
interference
.
Once
he
got
in
,
it
would
be
for
the
outside
world
as
*NL*
though
he
had
never
existed
.
He
would
have
nothing
but
the
soles
of
his
*NL*
two
feet
to
stand
upon
,
and
he
would
have
first
to
find
his
ground
at
*NL*
that
.
``
Never
existed
--
that
's
it
,
by
Jove
,
''
he
murmured
to
himself
.
His
*NL*
eyes
,
fastened
upon
my
lips
,
sparkled
.
If
he
had
thoroughly
understood
*NL*
the
conditions
,
I
concluded
,
he
had
better
jump
into
the
first
gharry
he
*NL*
could
see
and
drive
on
to
Stein
's
house
for
his
final
instructions
.
He
*NL*
flung
out
of
the
room
before
I
had
fairly
finished
speaking
.

CHAPTER
23
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
did
not
return
till
next
morning
.
He
had
been
kept
to
dinner
and
for
*NL*
the
night
.
There
never
had
been
such
a
wonderful
man
as
Mr.
Stein
.
He
*NL*
had
in
his
pocket
a
letter
for
Cornelius
-LRB-
``
the
Johnnie
who
's
going
to
*NL*
get
the
sack
,
''
he
explained
,
with
a
momentary
drop
in
his
elation
-RRB-
,
and
*NL*
he
exhibited
with
glee
a
silver
ring
,
such
as
natives
use
,
worn
down
*NL*
very
thin
and
showing
faint
traces
of
chasing
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
was
his
introduction
to
an
old
chap
called
Doramin
--
one
of
the
*NL*
principal
men
out
there
--
a
big
pot
--
who
had
been
Mr.
Stein
's
friend
in
*NL*
that
country
where
he
had
all
these
adventures
.
Mr.
Stein
called
him
*NL*
``
war-comrade
.
''
War-comrade
was
good
.
Was
n't
it
?
And
did
n't
Mr.
Stein
*NL*
speak
English
wonderfully
well
?
Said
he
had
learned
it
in
Celebes
--
of
*NL*
all
places
!
That
was
awfully
funny
.
Was
it
not
?
He
did
speak
with
an
*NL*
accent
--
a
twang
--
did
I
notice
?
That
chap
Doramin
had
given
him
the
ring
.
*NL*
They
had
exchanged
presents
when
they
parted
for
the
last
time
.
Sort
of
*NL*
promising
eternal
friendship
.
He
called
it
fine
--
did
I
not
?
They
had
*NL*
to
make
a
dash
for
dear
life
out
of
the
country
when
that
*NL*
Mohammed
--
Mohammed
--
What
's
-
his-name
had
been
killed
.
I
knew
the
story
,
*NL*
of
course
.
Seemed
a
beastly
shame
,
did
n't
it
?
...
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
ran
on
like
this
,
forgetting
his
plate
,
with
a
knife
and
fork
in
*NL*
hand
-LRB-
he
had
found
me
at
tiffin
-RRB-
,
slightly
flushed
,
and
with
his
eyes
*NL*
darkened
many
shades
,
which
was
with
him
a
sign
of
excitement
.
The
ring
*NL*
was
a
sort
of
credential
--
-LRB-
``
It
's
like
something
you
read
of
in
books
,
''
*NL*
he
threw
in
appreciatively
-RRB-
--
and
Doramin
would
do
his
best
for
him
.
Mr.
*NL*
Stein
had
been
the
means
of
saving
that
chap
's
life
on
some
occasion
;
*NL*
purely
by
accident
,
Mr.
Stein
had
said
,
but
he
--
Jim
--
had
his
own
opinion
*NL*
about
that
.
Mr.
Stein
was
just
the
man
to
look
out
for
such
accidents
.
*NL*
No
matter
.
Accident
or
purpose
,
this
would
serve
his
turn
immensely
.
*NL*
Hoped
to
goodness
the
jolly
old
beggar
had
not
gone
off
the
hooks
*NL*
meantime
.
Mr.
Stein
could
not
tell
.
There
had
been
no
news
for
more
*NL*
than
a
year
;
they
were
kicking
up
no
end
of
an
all-fired
row
amongst
*NL*
themselves
,
and
the
river
was
closed
.
Jolly
awkward
,
this
;
but
,
no
fear
;
*NL*
he
would
manage
to
find
a
crack
to
get
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
impressed
,
almost
frightened
,
me
with
his
elated
rattle
.
He
was
*NL*
voluble
like
a
youngster
on
the
eve
of
a
long
holiday
with
a
prospect
of
*NL*
delightful
scrapes
,
and
such
an
attitude
of
mind
in
a
grown
man
and
in
*NL*
this
connection
had
in
it
something
phenomenal
,
a
little
mad
,
dangerous
,
*NL*
unsafe
.
I
was
on
the
point
of
entreating
him
to
take
things
seriously
*NL*
when
he
dropped
his
knife
and
fork
-LRB-
he
had
begun
eating
,
or
rather
*NL*
swallowing
food
,
as
it
were
,
unconsciously
-RRB-
,
and
began
a
search
all
*NL*
round
his
plate
.
The
ring
!
The
ring
!
Where
the
devil
...
Ah
!
Here
it
*NL*
was
...
He
closed
his
big
hand
on
it
,
and
tried
all
his
pockets
one
*NL*
after
another
.
Jove
!
would
n't
do
to
lose
the
thing
.
He
meditated
gravely
*NL*
over
his
fist
.
Had
it
?
Would
hang
the
bally
affair
round
his
neck
!
And
*NL*
he
proceeded
to
do
this
immediately
,
producing
a
string
-LRB-
which
looked
*NL*
like
a
bit
of
a
cotton
shoe-lace
-RRB-
for
the
purpose
.
There
!
That
would
do
*NL*
the
trick
!
It
would
be
the
deuce
if
...
He
seemed
to
catch
sight
of
my
*NL*
face
for
the
first
time
,
and
it
steadied
him
a
little
.
I
probably
did
n't
*NL*
realise
,
he
said
with
a
naive
gravity
,
how
much
importance
he
attached
*NL*
to
that
token
.
It
meant
a
friend
;
and
it
is
a
good
thing
to
have
a
*NL*
friend
.
He
knew
something
about
that
.
He
nodded
at
me
expressively
,
but
*NL*
before
my
disclaiming
gesture
he
leaned
his
head
on
his
hand
and
for
*NL*
a
while
sat
silent
,
playing
thoughtfully
with
the
bread-crumbs
on
the
*NL*
cloth
...
``
Slam
the
door
--
that
was
jolly
well
put
,
''
he
cried
,
and
*NL*
jumping
up
,
began
to
pace
the
room
,
reminding
me
by
the
set
of
the
*NL*
shoulders
,
the
turn
of
his
head
,
the
headlong
and
uneven
stride
,
of
*NL*
that
night
when
he
had
paced
thus
,
confessing
,
explaining
--
what
you
*NL*
will
--
but
,
in
the
last
instance
,
living
--
living
before
me
,
under
his
*NL*
own
little
cloud
,
with
all
his
unconscious
subtlety
which
could
draw
*NL*
consolation
from
the
very
source
of
sorrow
.
It
was
the
same
mood
,
the
*NL*
same
and
different
,
like
a
fickle
companion
that
to-day
guiding
you
*NL*
on
the
true
path
,
with
the
same
eyes
,
the
same
step
,
the
same
impulse
,
*NL*
to-morrow
will
lead
you
hopelessly
astray
.
His
tread
was
assured
,
his
*NL*
straying
,
darkened
eyes
seemed
to
search
the
room
for
something
.
One
of
*NL*
his
footfalls
somehow
sounded
louder
than
the
other
--
the
fault
of
his
*NL*
boots
probably
--
and
gave
a
curious
impression
of
an
invisible
halt
in
*NL*
his
gait
.
One
of
his
hands
was
rammed
deep
into
his
trousers
'
pocket
,
*NL*
the
other
waved
suddenly
above
his
head
.
``
Slam
the
door
!
''
he
shouted
.
*NL*
``
I
've
been
waiting
for
that
.
I
'll
show
yet
...
I
'll
...
I
'm
ready
*NL*
for
any
confounded
thing
...
I
've
been
dreaming
of
it
...
Jove
!
Get
*NL*
out
of
this
.
Jove
!
This
is
luck
at
last
...
You
wait
.
I
'll
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
tossed
his
head
fearlessly
,
and
I
confess
that
for
the
first
and
*NL*
last
time
in
our
acquaintance
I
perceived
myself
unexpectedly
to
be
*NL*
thoroughly
sick
of
him
.
Why
these
vapourings
?
He
was
stumping
about
*NL*
the
room
flourishing
his
arm
absurdly
,
and
now
and
then
feeling
on
*NL*
his
breast
for
the
ring
under
his
clothes
.
Where
was
the
sense
of
such
*NL*
exaltation
in
a
man
appointed
to
be
a
trading-clerk
,
and
in
a
place
*NL*
where
there
was
no
trade
--
at
that
?
Why
hurl
defiance
at
the
universe
?
*NL*
This
was
not
a
proper
frame
of
mind
to
approach
any
undertaking
;
an
*NL*
improper
frame
of
mind
not
only
for
him
,
I
said
,
but
for
any
man
.
He
*NL*
stood
still
over
me
.
Did
I
think
so
?
he
asked
,
by
no
means
subdued
,
and
*NL*
with
a
smile
in
which
I
seemed
to
detect
suddenly
something
insolent
.
*NL*
But
then
I
am
twenty
years
his
senior
.
Youth
is
insolent
;
it
is
its
*NL*
right
--
its
necessity
;
it
has
got
to
assert
itself
,
and
all
assertion
in
*NL*
this
world
of
doubts
is
a
defiance
,
is
an
insolence
.
He
went
off
into
a
*NL*
far
corner
,
and
coming
back
,
he
,
figuratively
speaking
,
turned
to
rend
*NL*
me
.
I
spoke
like
that
because
I
--
even
I
,
who
had
been
no
end
kind
*NL*
to
him
--
even
I
remembered
--
remembered
--
against
him
--
what
--
what
had
*NL*
happened
.
And
what
about
others
--
the
--
the
--
world
?
Where
's
the
wonder
he
*NL*
wanted
to
get
out
,
meant
to
get
out
,
meant
to
stay
out
--
by
heavens
!
And
*NL*
I
talked
about
proper
frames
of
mind
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
is
not
I
or
the
world
who
remember
,
''
I
shouted
.
``
It
is
you
--
you
,
*NL*
who
remember
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
did
not
flinch
,
and
went
on
with
heat
,
``
Forget
everything
,
*NL*
everybody
,
everybody
.
''
...
His
voice
fell
...
``
But
you
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Yes
--
me
too
--
if
it
would
help
,
''
I
said
,
also
in
a
low
tone
.
After
this
*NL*
we
remained
silent
and
languid
for
a
time
as
if
exhausted
.
Then
he
began
*NL*
again
,
composedly
,
and
told
me
that
Mr.
Stein
had
instructed
him
to
wait
*NL*
for
a
month
or
so
,
to
see
whether
it
was
possible
for
him
to
remain
,
*NL*
before
he
began
building
a
new
house
for
himself
,
so
as
to
avoid
*NL*
``
vain
expense
.
''
He
did
make
use
of
funny
expressions
--
Stein
did
.
``
Vain
*NL*
expense
''
was
good
...
Remain
?
Why
!
of
course
.
He
would
hang
on
.
Let
*NL*
him
only
get
in
--
that
's
all
;
he
would
answer
for
it
he
would
remain
.
*NL*
Never
get
out
.
It
was
easy
enough
to
remain
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Do
n't
be
foolhardy
,
''
I
said
,
rendered
uneasy
by
his
threatening
tone
.
*NL*
``
If
you
only
live
long
enough
you
will
want
to
come
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Come
back
to
what
?
''
he
asked
absently
,
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
*NL*
face
of
a
clock
on
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
silent
for
a
while
.
``
Is
it
to
be
never
,
then
?
''
I
said
.
``
Never
,
''
*NL*
he
repeated
dreamily
without
looking
at
me
,
and
then
flew
into
sudden
*NL*
activity
.
``
Jove
!
Two
o'clock
,
and
I
sail
at
four
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
true
.
A
brigantine
of
Stein
's
was
leaving
for
the
westward
that
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
he
had
been
instructed
to
take
his
passage
in
her
,
only
*NL*
no
orders
to
delay
the
sailing
had
been
given
.
I
suppose
Stein
forgot
.
*NL*
He
made
a
rush
to
get
his
things
while
I
went
aboard
my
ship
,
where
*NL*
he
promised
to
call
on
his
way
to
the
outer
roadstead
.
He
turned
up
*NL*
accordingly
in
a
great
hurry
and
with
a
small
leather
valise
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
This
would
n't
do
,
and
I
offered
him
an
old
tin
trunk
of
mine
*NL*
supposed
to
be
water-tight
,
or
at
least
damp-tight
.
He
effected
the
*NL*
transfer
by
the
simple
process
of
shooting
out
the
contents
of
his
*NL*
valise
as
you
would
empty
a
sack
of
wheat
.
I
saw
three
books
in
the
*NL*
tumble
;
two
small
,
in
dark
covers
,
and
a
thick
green-and-gold
volume
--
a
*NL*
half-crown
complete
Shakespeare
.
``
You
read
this
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Yes
.
Best
*NL*
thing
to
cheer
up
a
fellow
,
''
he
said
hastily
.
I
was
struck
by
this
*NL*
appreciation
,
but
there
was
no
time
for
Shakespearian
talk
.
A
*NL*
heavy
revolver
and
two
small
boxes
of
cartridges
were
lying
on
the
*NL*
cuddy-table
.
``
Pray
take
this
,
''
I
said
.
``
It
may
help
you
to
remain
.
''
*NL*
No
sooner
were
these
words
out
of
my
mouth
than
I
perceived
what
grim
*NL*
meaning
they
could
bear
.
``
May
help
you
to
get
in
,
''
I
corrected
myself
*NL*
remorsefully
.
He
however
was
not
troubled
by
obscure
meanings
;
he
*NL*
thanked
me
effusively
and
bolted
out
,
calling
Good-bye
over
his
*NL*
shoulder
.
I
heard
his
voice
through
the
ship
's
side
urging
his
boatmen
*NL*
to
give
way
,
and
looking
out
of
the
stern-port
I
saw
the
boat
rounding
*NL*
under
the
counter
.
He
sat
in
her
leaning
forward
,
exciting
his
men
with
*NL*
voice
and
gestures
;
and
as
he
had
kept
the
revolver
in
his
hand
and
*NL*
seemed
to
be
presenting
it
at
their
heads
,
I
shall
never
forget
the
*NL*
scared
faces
of
the
four
Javanese
,
and
the
frantic
swing
of
their
stroke
*NL*
which
snatched
that
vision
from
under
my
eyes
.
Then
turning
away
,
the
*NL*
first
thing
I
saw
were
the
two
boxes
of
cartridges
on
the
cuddy-table
.
*NL*
He
had
forgotten
to
take
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
ordered
my
gig
manned
at
once
;
but
Jim
's
rowers
,
under
the
impression
*NL*
that
their
lives
hung
on
a
thread
while
they
had
that
madman
in
the
*NL*
boat
,
made
such
excellent
time
that
before
I
had
traversed
half
the
*NL*
distance
between
the
two
vessels
I
caught
sight
of
him
clambering
over
*NL*
the
rail
,
and
of
his
box
being
passed
up
.
All
the
brigantine
's
canvas
*NL*
was
loose
,
her
mainsail
was
set
,
and
the
windlass
was
just
beginning
to
*NL*
clink
as
I
stepped
upon
her
deck
:
her
master
,
a
dapper
little
half-caste
*NL*
of
forty
or
so
,
in
a
blue
flannel
suit
,
with
lively
eyes
,
his
round
*NL*
face
the
colour
of
lemon-peel
,
and
with
a
thin
little
black
moustache
*NL*
drooping
on
each
side
of
his
thick
,
dark
lips
,
came
forward
smirking
.
He
*NL*
turned
out
,
notwithstanding
his
self-satisfied
and
cheery
exterior
,
to
*NL*
be
of
a
careworn
temperament
.
In
answer
to
a
remark
of
mine
-LRB-
while
Jim
*NL*
had
gone
below
for
a
moment
-RRB-
he
said
,
``
Oh
yes
.
Patusan
.
''
He
was
going
to
*NL*
carry
the
gentleman
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
,
but
would
``
never
ascend
.
''
*NL*
His
flowing
English
seemed
to
be
derived
from
a
dictionary
compiled
by
*NL*
a
lunatic
.
Had
Mr.
Stein
desired
him
to
``
ascend
,
''
he
would
have
*NL*
``
reverentially
''
--
-LRB-
I
think
he
wanted
to
say
respectfully
--
but
devil
only
*NL*
knows
-RRB-
--
``
reverentially
made
objects
for
the
safety
of
properties
.
''
*NL*
If
disregarded
,
he
would
have
presented
``
resignation
to
quit
.
''
Twelve
*NL*
months
ago
he
had
made
his
last
voyage
there
,
and
though
Mr.
Cornelius
*NL*
``
propitiated
many
offertories
''
to
Mr.
Rajah
Allang
and
the
``
principal
*NL*
populations
,
''
on
conditions
which
made
the
trade
``
a
snare
and
ashes
*NL*
in
the
mouth
,
''
yet
his
ship
had
been
fired
upon
from
the
woods
by
*NL*
``
irresponsive
parties
''
all
the
way
down
the
river
;
which
causing
his
*NL*
crew
``
from
exposure
to
limb
to
remain
silent
in
hidings
,
''
the
brigantine
*NL*
was
nearly
stranded
on
a
sandbank
at
the
bar
,
where
she
``
would
have
*NL*
been
perishable
beyond
the
act
of
man
.
''
The
angry
disgust
at
the
*NL*
recollection
,
the
pride
of
his
fluency
,
to
which
he
turned
an
attentive
*NL*
ear
,
struggled
for
the
possession
of
his
broad
simple
face
.
He
scowled
*NL*
and
beamed
at
me
,
and
watched
with
satisfaction
the
undeniable
effect
*NL*
of
his
phraseology
.
Dark
frowns
ran
swiftly
over
the
placid
sea
,
and
*NL*
the
brigantine
,
with
her
fore-topsail
to
the
mast
and
her
main-boom
*NL*
amidships
,
seemed
bewildered
amongst
the
cat
's
-
paws
.
He
told
me
further
,
*NL*
gnashing
his
teeth
,
that
the
Rajah
was
a
``
laughable
hyaena
''
-LRB-
ca
n't
*NL*
imagine
how
he
got
hold
of
hyaenas
-RRB-
;
while
somebody
else
was
many
*NL*
times
falser
than
the
``
weapons
of
a
crocodile
.
''
Keeping
one
eye
on
the
*NL*
movements
of
his
crew
forward
,
he
let
loose
his
volubility
--
comparing
*NL*
the
place
to
a
``
cage
of
beasts
made
ravenous
by
long
impenitence
.
''
I
*NL*
fancy
he
meant
impunity
.
He
had
no
intention
,
he
cried
,
to
``
exhibit
*NL*
himself
to
be
made
attached
purposefully
to
robbery
.
''
The
long-drawn
*NL*
wails
,
giving
the
time
for
the
pull
of
the
men
catting
the
anchor
,
*NL*
came
to
an
end
,
and
he
lowered
his
voice
.
``
Plenty
too
much
enough
of
*NL*
Patusan
,
''
he
concluded
,
with
energy
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
heard
afterwards
he
had
been
so
indiscreet
as
to
get
himself
tied
up
*NL*
by
the
neck
with
a
rattan
halter
to
a
post
planted
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
mud-hole
before
the
Rajah
's
house
.
He
spent
the
best
part
of
a
day
and
a
*NL*
whole
night
in
that
unwholesome
situation
,
but
there
is
every
reason
*NL*
to
believe
the
thing
had
been
meant
as
a
sort
of
joke
.
He
brooded
for
*NL*
a
while
over
that
horrid
memory
,
I
suppose
,
and
then
addressed
in
a
*NL*
quarrelsome
tone
the
man
coming
aft
to
the
helm
.
When
he
turned
to
me
*NL*
again
it
was
to
speak
judicially
,
without
passion
.
He
would
take
the
*NL*
gentleman
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
at
Batu
Kring
-LRB-
Patusan
town
``
being
*NL*
situated
internally
,
''
he
remarked
,
``
thirty
miles
''
-RRB-
.
But
in
his
eyes
,
*NL*
he
continued
--
a
tone
of
bored
,
weary
conviction
replacing
his
previous
*NL*
voluble
delivery
--
the
gentleman
was
already
``
in
the
similitude
of
a
*NL*
corpse
.
''
``
What
?
What
do
you
say
?
''
I
asked
.
He
assumed
a
startlingly
*NL*
ferocious
demeanour
,
and
imitated
to
perfection
the
act
of
stabbing
from
*NL*
behind
.
``
Already
like
the
body
of
one
deported
,
''
he
explained
,
with
the
*NL*
insufferably
conceited
air
of
his
kind
after
what
they
imagine
a
display
*NL*
of
cleverness
.
Behind
him
I
perceived
Jim
smiling
silently
at
me
,
and
*NL*
with
a
raised
hand
checking
the
exclamation
on
my
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
,
while
the
half-caste
,
bursting
with
importance
,
shouted
his
*NL*
orders
,
while
the
yards
swung
creaking
and
the
heavy
boom
came
surging
*NL*
over
,
Jim
and
I
,
alone
as
it
were
,
to
leeward
of
the
mainsail
,
clasped
*NL*
each
other
's
hands
and
exchanged
the
last
hurried
words
.
My
heart
was
*NL*
freed
from
that
dull
resentment
which
had
existed
side
by
side
with
*NL*
interest
in
his
fate
.
The
absurd
chatter
of
the
half-caste
had
given
*NL*
more
reality
to
the
miserable
dangers
of
his
path
than
Stein
's
careful
*NL*
statements
.
On
that
occasion
the
sort
of
formality
that
had
been
always
*NL*
present
in
our
intercourse
vanished
from
our
speech
;
I
believe
I
*NL*
called
him
``
dear
boy
,
''
and
he
tacked
on
the
words
``
old
man
''
to
some
*NL*
half-uttered
expression
of
gratitude
,
as
though
his
risk
set
off
against
*NL*
my
years
had
made
us
more
equal
in
age
and
in
feeling
.
There
was
a
*NL*
moment
of
real
and
profound
intimacy
,
unexpected
and
short-lived
like
a
*NL*
glimpse
of
some
everlasting
,
of
some
saving
truth
.
He
exerted
himself
to
*NL*
soothe
me
as
though
he
had
been
the
more
mature
of
the
two
.
``
All
right
,
*NL*
all
right
,
''
he
said
,
rapidly
,
and
with
feeling
.
``
I
promise
to
take
care
*NL*
of
myself
.
Yes
;
I
wo
n't
take
any
risks
.
Not
a
single
blessed
risk
.
Of
*NL*
course
not
.
I
mean
to
hang
out
.
Do
n't
you
worry
.
Jove
!
I
feel
as
if
*NL*
nothing
could
touch
me
.
Why
!
this
is
luck
from
the
word
Go
.
I
would
n't
*NL*
spoil
such
a
magnificent
chance
!
''
...
A
magnificent
chance
!
Well
,
it
*NL*
_
was
_
magnificent
,
but
chances
are
what
men
make
them
,
and
how
was
I
*NL*
to
know
?
As
he
had
said
,
even
I
--
even
I
remembered
--
his
--
his
misfortune
*NL*
against
him
.
It
was
true
.
And
the
best
thing
for
him
was
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
My
gig
had
dropped
in
the
wake
of
the
brigantine
,
and
I
saw
him
aft
*NL*
detached
upon
the
light
of
the
westering
sun
,
raising
his
cap
high
above
*NL*
his
head
.
I
heard
an
indistinct
shout
,
``
You
--
shall
--
hear
--
of
--
me
.
''
Of
*NL*
me
,
or
from
me
,
I
do
n't
know
which
.
I
think
it
must
have
been
of
me
.
My
*NL*
eyes
were
too
dazzled
by
the
glitter
of
the
sea
below
his
feet
to
see
*NL*
him
clearly
;
I
am
fated
never
to
see
him
clearly
;
but
I
can
assure
you
*NL*
no
man
could
have
appeared
less
``
in
the
similitude
of
a
corpse
,
''
as
that
*NL*
half-caste
croaker
had
put
it
.
I
could
see
the
little
wretch
's
face
,
*NL*
the
shape
and
colour
of
a
ripe
pumpkin
,
poked
out
somewhere
under
Jim
's
*NL*
elbow
.
He
,
too
,
raised
his
arm
as
if
for
a
downward
thrust
.
Absit
omen

CHAPTER
24
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
coast
of
Patusan
-LRB-
I
saw
it
nearly
two
years
afterwards
-RRB-
is
straight
*NL*
and
sombre
,
and
faces
a
misty
ocean
.
Red
trails
are
seen
like
cataracts
*NL*
of
rust
streaming
under
the
dark-green
foliage
of
bushes
and
creepers
*NL*
clothing
the
low
cliffs
.
Swampy
plains
open
out
at
the
mouth
of
rivers
,
*NL*
with
a
view
of
jagged
blue
peaks
beyond
the
vast
forests
.
In
the
offing
*NL*
a
chain
of
islands
,
dark
,
crumbling
shapes
,
stand
out
in
the
everlasting
*NL*
sunlit
haze
like
the
remnants
of
a
wall
breached
by
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
is
a
village
of
fisher-folk
at
the
mouth
of
the
Batu
Kring
branch
*NL*
of
the
estuary
.
The
river
,
which
had
been
closed
so
long
,
was
open
then
,
*NL*
and
Stein
's
little
schooner
,
in
which
I
had
my
passage
,
worked
her
*NL*
way
up
in
three
tides
without
being
exposed
to
a
fusillade
from
*NL*
``
irresponsive
parties
.
''
Such
a
state
of
affairs
belonged
already
to
*NL*
ancient
history
,
if
I
could
believe
the
elderly
headman
of
the
fishing
*NL*
village
,
who
came
on
board
to
act
as
a
sort
of
pilot
.
He
talked
to
me
*NL*
-LRB-
the
second
white
man
he
had
ever
seen
-RRB-
with
confidence
,
and
most
of
his
*NL*
talk
was
about
the
first
white
man
he
had
ever
seen
.
He
called
him
Tuan
*NL*
Jim
,
and
the
tone
of
his
references
was
made
remarkable
by
a
strange
*NL*
mixture
of
familiarity
and
awe
.
They
,
in
the
village
,
were
under
that
*NL*
lord
's
special
protection
,
which
showed
that
Jim
bore
no
grudge
.
If
*NL*
he
had
warned
me
that
I
would
hear
of
him
it
was
perfectly
true
.
I
was
*NL*
hearing
of
him
.
There
was
already
a
story
that
the
tide
had
turned
*NL*
two
hours
before
its
time
to
help
him
on
his
journey
up
the
river
.
The
*NL*
talkative
old
man
himself
had
steered
the
canoe
and
had
marvelled
at
the
*NL*
phenomenon
.
Moreover
,
all
the
glory
was
in
his
family
.
His
son
and
his
*NL*
son-in-law
had
paddled
;
but
they
were
only
youths
without
experience
,
*NL*
who
did
not
notice
the
speed
of
the
canoe
till
he
pointed
out
to
them
*NL*
the
amazing
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
's
coming
to
that
fishing
village
was
a
blessing
;
but
to
them
,
as
to
*NL*
many
of
us
,
the
blessing
came
heralded
by
terrors
.
So
many
generations
*NL*
had
been
released
since
the
last
white
man
had
visited
the
river
that
*NL*
the
very
tradition
had
been
lost
.
The
appearance
of
the
being
that
*NL*
descended
upon
them
and
demanded
inflexibly
to
be
taken
up
to
Patusan
*NL*
was
discomposing
;
his
insistence
was
alarming
;
his
generosity
more
than
*NL*
suspicious
.
It
was
an
unheard-of
request
.
There
was
no
precedent
.
What
*NL*
would
the
Rajah
say
to
this
?
What
would
he
do
to
them
?
The
best
part
*NL*
of
the
night
was
spent
in
consultation
;
but
the
immediate
risk
from
the
*NL*
anger
of
that
strange
man
seemed
so
great
that
at
last
a
cranky
dug-out
*NL*
was
got
ready
.
The
women
shrieked
with
grief
as
it
put
off
.
A
fearless
*NL*
old
hag
cursed
the
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
sat
in
it
,
as
I
've
told
you
,
on
his
tin
box
,
nursing
the
unloaded
*NL*
revolver
on
his
lap
.
He
sat
with
precaution
--
than
which
there
is
nothing
*NL*
more
fatiguing
--
and
thus
entered
the
land
he
was
destined
to
fill
with
*NL*
the
fame
of
his
virtues
,
from
the
blue
peaks
inland
to
the
white
ribbon
*NL*
of
surf
on
the
coast
.
At
the
first
bend
he
lost
sight
of
the
sea
with
*NL*
its
labouring
waves
for
ever
rising
,
sinking
,
and
vanishing
to
rise
*NL*
again
--
the
very
image
of
struggling
mankind
--
and
faced
the
immovable
*NL*
forests
rooted
deep
in
the
soil
,
soaring
towards
the
sunshine
,
*NL*
everlasting
in
the
shadowy
might
of
their
tradition
,
like
life
itself
.
*NL*
And
his
opportunity
sat
veiled
by
his
side
like
an
Eastern
bride
waiting
*NL*
to
be
uncovered
by
the
hand
of
the
master
.
He
too
was
the
heir
of
a
*NL*
shadowy
and
mighty
tradition
!
He
told
me
,
however
,
that
he
had
never
in
*NL*
his
life
felt
so
depressed
and
tired
as
in
that
canoe
.
All
the
movement
*NL*
he
dared
to
allow
himself
was
to
reach
,
as
it
were
by
stealth
,
after
the
*NL*
shell
of
half
a
cocoa-nut
floating
between
his
shoes
,
and
bale
some
of
*NL*
the
water
out
with
a
carefully
restrained
action
.
He
discovered
how
hard
*NL*
the
lid
of
a
block-tin
case
was
to
sit
upon
.
He
had
heroic
health
;
but
*NL*
several
times
during
that
journey
he
experienced
fits
of
giddiness
,
and
*NL*
between
whiles
he
speculated
hazily
as
to
the
size
of
the
blister
the
*NL*
sun
was
raising
on
his
back
.
For
amusement
he
tried
by
looking
ahead
to
*NL*
decide
whether
the
muddy
object
he
saw
lying
on
the
water
's
edge
was
a
*NL*
log
of
wood
or
an
alligator
.
Only
very
soon
he
had
to
give
that
up
.
No
*NL*
fun
in
it
.
Always
alligator
.
One
of
them
flopped
into
the
river
and
all
*NL*
but
capsized
the
canoe
.
But
this
excitement
was
over
directly
.
Then
in
*NL*
a
long
empty
reach
he
was
very
grateful
to
a
troop
of
monkeys
who
came
*NL*
right
down
on
the
bank
and
made
an
insulting
hullabaloo
on
his
passage
.
*NL*
Such
was
the
way
in
which
he
was
approaching
greatness
as
genuine
as
any
*NL*
man
ever
achieved
.
Principally
,
he
longed
for
sunset
;
and
meantime
*NL*
his
three
paddlers
were
preparing
to
put
into
execution
their
plan
of
*NL*
delivering
him
up
to
the
Rajah
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
suppose
I
must
have
been
stupid
with
fatigue
,
or
perhaps
I
did
doze
*NL*
off
for
a
time
,
''
he
said
.
The
first
thing
he
knew
was
his
canoe
coming
*NL*
to
the
bank
.
He
became
instantaneously
aware
of
the
forest
having
been
*NL*
left
behind
,
of
the
first
houses
being
visible
higher
up
,
of
a
stockade
*NL*
on
his
left
,
and
of
his
boatmen
leaping
out
together
upon
a
low
point
of
*NL*
land
and
taking
to
their
heels
.
Instinctively
he
leaped
out
after
them
.
*NL*
At
first
he
thought
himself
deserted
for
some
inconceivable
reason
,
but
*NL*
he
heard
excited
shouts
,
a
gate
swung
open
,
and
a
lot
of
people
poured
*NL*
out
,
making
towards
him
.
At
the
same
time
a
boat
full
of
armed
men
*NL*
appeared
on
the
river
and
came
alongside
his
empty
canoe
,
thus
shutting
*NL*
off
his
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
was
too
startled
to
be
quite
cool
--
do
n't
you
know
?
and
if
that
*NL*
revolver
had
been
loaded
I
would
have
shot
somebody
--
perhaps
two
,
three
*NL*
bodies
,
and
that
would
have
been
the
end
of
me
.
But
it
was
n't
...
''
*NL*
``
Why
not
?
''
I
asked
.
``
Well
,
I
could
n't
fight
the
whole
population
,
and
*NL*
I
was
n't
coming
to
them
as
if
I
were
afraid
of
my
life
,
''
he
said
,
with
*NL*
just
a
faint
hint
of
his
stubborn
sulkiness
in
the
glance
he
gave
me
.
*NL*
I
refrained
from
pointing
out
to
him
that
they
could
not
have
known
the
*NL*
chambers
were
actually
empty
.
He
had
to
satisfy
himself
in
his
own
way
.
*NL*
...
``
Anyhow
it
was
n't
,
''
he
repeated
good-humouredly
,
``
and
so
I
just
*NL*
stood
still
and
asked
them
what
was
the
matter
.
That
seemed
to
strike
*NL*
them
dumb
.
I
saw
some
of
these
thieves
going
off
with
my
box
.
That
*NL*
long-legged
old
scoundrel
Kassim
-LRB-
I
'll
show
him
to
you
to-morrow
-RRB-
*NL*
ran
out
fussing
to
me
about
the
Rajah
wanting
to
see
me
.
I
said
,
`
All
*NL*
right
.
'
I
too
wanted
to
see
the
Rajah
,
and
I
simply
walked
in
through
*NL*
the
gate
and
--
and
--
here
I
am
.
''
He
laughed
,
and
then
with
unexpected
*NL*
emphasis
,
``
And
do
you
know
what
's
the
best
in
it
?
''
he
asked
.
``
I
'll
tell
*NL*
you
.
It
's
the
knowledge
that
had
I
been
wiped
out
it
is
this
place
that
*NL*
would
have
been
the
loser
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
spoke
thus
to
me
before
his
house
on
that
evening
I
've
*NL*
mentioned
--
after
we
had
watched
the
moon
float
away
above
the
chasm
*NL*
between
the
hills
like
an
ascending
spirit
out
of
a
grave
;
its
sheen
*NL*
descended
,
cold
and
pale
,
like
the
ghost
of
dead
sunlight
.
There
*NL*
is
something
haunting
in
the
light
of
the
moon
;
it
has
all
the
*NL*
dispassionateness
of
a
disembodied
soul
,
and
something
of
its
*NL*
inconceivable
mystery
.
It
is
to
our
sunshine
,
which
--
say
what
you
*NL*
like
--
is
all
we
have
to
live
by
,
what
the
echo
is
to
the
sound
:
*NL*
misleading
and
confusing
whether
the
note
be
mocking
or
sad
.
It
robs
all
*NL*
forms
of
matter
--
which
,
after
all
,
is
our
domain
--
of
their
substance
,
*NL*
and
gives
a
sinister
reality
to
shadows
alone
.
And
the
shadows
were
*NL*
very
real
around
us
,
but
Jim
by
my
side
looked
very
stalwart
,
as
though
*NL*
nothing
--
not
even
the
occult
power
of
moonlight
--
could
rob
him
of
his
*NL*
reality
in
my
eyes
.
Perhaps
,
indeed
,
nothing
could
touch
him
since
he
*NL*
had
survived
the
assault
of
the
dark
powers
.
All
was
silent
,
all
was
*NL*
still
;
even
on
the
river
the
moonbeams
slept
as
on
a
pool
.
It
was
the
*NL*
moment
of
high
water
,
a
moment
of
immobility
that
accentuated
the
utter
*NL*
isolation
of
this
lost
corner
of
the
earth
.
The
houses
crowding
along
*NL*
the
wide
shining
sweep
without
ripple
or
glitter
,
stepping
into
the
*NL*
water
in
a
line
of
jostling
,
vague
,
grey
,
silvery
forms
mingled
with
*NL*
black
masses
of
shadow
,
were
like
a
spectral
herd
of
shapeless
creatures
*NL*
pressing
forward
to
drink
in
a
spectral
and
lifeless
stream
.
Here
and
*NL*
there
a
red
gleam
twinkled
within
the
bamboo
walls
,
warm
,
like
a
living
*NL*
spark
,
significant
of
human
affections
,
of
shelter
,
of
repose
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
confessed
to
me
that
he
often
watched
these
tiny
warm
gleams
go
*NL*
out
one
by
one
,
that
he
loved
to
see
people
go
to
sleep
under
his
eyes
,
*NL*
confident
in
the
security
of
to-morrow
.
``
Peaceful
here
,
eh
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
He
was
not
eloquent
,
but
there
was
a
deep
meaning
in
the
words
that
*NL*
followed
.
``
Look
at
these
houses
;
there
's
not
one
where
I
am
not
trusted
.
*NL*
Jove
!
I
told
you
I
would
hang
on
.
Ask
any
man
,
woman
,
or
child
...
''
He
*NL*
paused
.
``
Well
,
I
am
all
right
anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
observed
quickly
that
he
had
found
that
out
in
the
end
.
I
had
been
*NL*
sure
of
it
,
I
added
.
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Were
you
?
''
He
pressed
my
arm
*NL*
lightly
above
the
elbow
.
``
Well
,
then
--
you
were
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
was
elation
and
pride
,
there
was
awe
almost
,
in
that
low
*NL*
exclamation
.
``
Jove
!
''
he
cried
,
``
only
think
what
it
is
to
me
.
''
Again
he
*NL*
pressed
my
arm
.
``
And
you
asked
me
whether
I
thought
of
leaving
.
Good
*NL*
God
!
I
!
want
to
leave
!
Especially
now
after
what
you
told
me
of
Mr.
*NL*
Stein
's
...
Leave
!
Why
!
That
's
what
I
was
afraid
of
.
It
would
have
*NL*
been
--
it
would
have
been
harder
than
dying
.
No
--
on
my
word
.
Do
n't
*NL*
laugh
.
I
must
feel
--
every
day
,
every
time
I
open
my
eyes
--
that
I
am
*NL*
trusted
--
that
nobody
has
a
right
--
do
n't
you
know
?
Leave
!
For
where
?
What
*NL*
for
?
To
get
what
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
had
told
him
-LRB-
indeed
it
was
the
main
object
of
my
visit
-RRB-
that
it
was
*NL*
Stein
's
intention
to
present
him
at
once
with
the
house
and
the
stock
*NL*
of
trading
goods
,
on
certain
easy
conditions
which
would
make
the
*NL*
transaction
perfectly
regular
and
valid
.
He
began
to
snort
and
plunge
at
*NL*
first
.
``
Confound
your
delicacy
!
''
I
shouted
.
``
It
is
n't
Stein
at
all
.
It
's
*NL*
giving
you
what
you
had
made
for
yourself
.
And
in
any
case
keep
your
*NL*
remarks
for
McNeil
--
when
you
meet
him
in
the
other
world
.
I
hope
it
*NL*
wo
n't
happen
soon
...
''
He
had
to
give
in
to
my
arguments
,
because
all
*NL*
his
conquests
,
the
trust
,
the
fame
,
the
friendships
,
the
love
--
all
these
*NL*
things
that
made
him
master
had
made
him
a
captive
,
too
.
He
looked
with
*NL*
an
owner
's
eye
at
the
peace
of
the
evening
,
at
the
river
,
at
the
houses
,
*NL*
at
the
everlasting
life
of
the
forests
,
at
the
life
of
the
old
mankind
,
*NL*
at
the
secrets
of
the
land
,
at
the
pride
of
his
own
heart
;
but
it
was
*NL*
they
that
possessed
him
and
made
him
their
own
to
the
innermost
thought
,
*NL*
to
the
slightest
stir
of
blood
,
to
his
last
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
something
to
be
proud
of
.
I
,
too
,
was
proud
--
for
him
,
if
not
so
*NL*
certain
of
the
fabulous
value
of
the
bargain
.
It
was
wonderful
.
It
was
*NL*
not
so
much
of
his
fearlessness
that
I
thought
.
It
is
strange
how
little
*NL*
account
I
took
of
it
:
as
if
it
had
been
something
too
conventional
to
be
*NL*
at
the
root
of
the
matter
.
No
.
I
was
more
struck
by
the
other
gifts
he
*NL*
had
displayed
.
He
had
proved
his
grasp
of
the
unfamiliar
situation
,
*NL*
his
intellectual
alertness
in
that
field
of
thought
.
There
was
his
*NL*
readiness
,
too
!
Amazing
.
And
all
this
had
come
to
him
in
a
manner
like
*NL*
keen
scent
to
a
well-bred
hound
.
He
was
not
eloquent
,
but
there
was
a
*NL*
dignity
in
this
constitutional
reticence
,
there
was
a
high
seriousness
*NL*
in
his
stammerings
.
He
had
still
his
old
trick
of
stubborn
blushing
.
Now
*NL*
and
then
,
though
,
a
word
,
a
sentence
,
would
escape
him
that
showed
how
*NL*
deeply
,
how
solemnly
,
he
felt
about
that
work
which
had
given
him
the
*NL*
certitude
of
rehabilitation
.
That
is
why
he
seemed
to
love
the
land
*NL*
and
the
people
with
a
sort
of
fierce
egoism
,
with
a
contemptuous
*NL*
tenderness
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
'
``
This
is
where
I
was
prisoner
for
three
days
,
''
he
murmured
to
me
-LRB-
it
*NL*
was
on
the
occasion
of
our
visit
to
the
Rajah
-RRB-
,
while
we
were
making
our
*NL*
way
slowly
through
a
kind
of
awestruck
riot
of
dependants
across
Tunku
*NL*
Allang
's
courtyard
.
``
Filthy
place
,
is
n't
it
?
And
I
could
n't
get
anything
*NL*
to
eat
either
,
unless
I
made
a
row
about
it
,
and
then
it
was
only
*NL*
a
small
plate
of
rice
and
a
fried
fish
not
much
bigger
than
a
*NL*
stickleback
--
confound
them
!
Jove
!
I
've
been
hungry
prowling
inside
this
*NL*
stinking
enclosure
with
some
of
these
vagabonds
shoving
their
mugs
right
*NL*
under
my
nose
.
I
had
given
up
that
famous
revolver
of
yours
at
the
first
*NL*
demand
.
Glad
to
get
rid
of
the
bally
thing
.
Look
like
a
fool
walking
*NL*
about
with
an
empty
shooting-iron
in
my
hand
.
''
At
that
moment
we
came
*NL*
into
the
presence
,
and
he
became
unflinchingly
grave
and
complimentary
*NL*
with
his
late
captor
.
Oh
!
magnificent
!
I
want
to
laugh
when
I
think
of
*NL*
it
.
But
I
was
impressed
,
too
.
The
old
disreputable
Tunku
Allang
could
*NL*
not
help
showing
his
fear
-LRB-
he
was
no
hero
,
for
all
the
tales
of
his
hot
*NL*
youth
he
was
fond
of
telling
-RRB-
;
and
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
wistful
*NL*
confidence
in
his
manner
towards
his
late
prisoner
.
Note
!
Even
where
he
*NL*
would
be
most
hated
he
was
still
trusted
.
Jim
--
as
far
as
I
could
follow
*NL*
the
conversation
--
was
improving
the
occasion
by
the
delivery
of
a
*NL*
lecture
.
Some
poor
villagers
had
been
waylaid
and
robbed
while
on
their
*NL*
way
to
Doramin
's
house
with
a
few
pieces
of
gum
or
beeswax
which
they
*NL*
wished
to
exchange
for
rice
.
``
It
was
Doramin
who
was
a
thief
,
''
burst
*NL*
out
the
Rajah
.
A
shaking
fury
seemed
to
enter
that
old
frail
body
.
*NL*
He
writhed
weirdly
on
his
mat
,
gesticulating
with
his
hands
and
feet
,
*NL*
tossing
the
tangled
strings
of
his
mop
--
an
impotent
incarnation
of
rage
.
*NL*
There
were
staring
eyes
and
dropping
jaws
all
around
us
.
Jim
began
to
*NL*
speak
.
Resolutely
,
coolly
,
and
for
some
time
he
enlarged
upon
the
text
*NL*
that
no
man
should
be
prevented
from
getting
his
food
and
his
children
's
*NL*
food
honestly
.
The
other
sat
like
a
tailor
at
his
board
,
one
palm
on
*NL*
each
knee
,
his
head
low
,
and
fixing
Jim
through
the
grey
hair
that
*NL*
fell
over
his
very
eyes
.
When
Jim
had
done
there
was
a
great
stillness
.
*NL*
Nobody
seemed
to
breathe
even
;
no
one
made
a
sound
till
the
old
Rajah
*NL*
sighed
faintly
,
and
looking
up
,
with
a
toss
of
his
head
,
said
quickly
,
*NL*
``
You
hear
,
my
people
!
No
more
of
these
little
games
.
''
This
decree
*NL*
was
received
in
profound
silence
.
A
rather
heavy
man
,
evidently
in
a
*NL*
position
of
confidence
,
with
intelligent
eyes
,
a
bony
,
broad
,
very
dark
*NL*
face
,
and
a
cheerily
of
officious
manner
-LRB-
I
learned
later
on
he
was
the
*NL*
executioner
-RRB-
,
presented
to
us
two
cups
of
coffee
on
a
brass
tray
,
which
*NL*
he
took
from
the
hands
of
an
inferior
attendant
.
``
You
need
n't
drink
,
''
*NL*
muttered
Jim
very
rapidly
.
I
did
n't
perceive
the
meaning
at
first
,
and
*NL*
only
looked
at
him
.
He
took
a
good
sip
and
sat
composedly
,
holding
the
*NL*
saucer
in
his
left
hand
.
In
a
moment
I
felt
excessively
annoyed
.
``
Why
*NL*
the
devil
,
''
I
whispered
,
smiling
at
him
amiably
,
``
do
you
expose
me
to
*NL*
such
a
stupid
risk
?
''
I
drank
,
of
course
,
there
was
nothing
for
it
,
while
*NL*
he
gave
no
sign
,
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
we
took
our
leave
.
*NL*
While
we
were
going
down
the
courtyard
to
our
boat
,
escorted
by
the
*NL*
intelligent
and
cheery
executioner
,
Jim
said
he
was
very
sorry
.
It
was
*NL*
the
barest
chance
,
of
course
.
Personally
he
thought
nothing
of
poison
.
*NL*
The
remotest
chance
.
He
was
--
he
assured
me
--
considered
to
be
infinitely
*NL*
more
useful
than
dangerous
,
and
so
...
``
But
the
Rajah
is
afraid
of
*NL*
you
abominably
.
Anybody
can
see
that
,
''
I
argued
with
,
I
own
,
a
certain
*NL*
peevishness
,
and
all
the
time
watching
anxiously
for
the
first
twist
of
*NL*
some
sort
of
ghastly
colic
.
I
was
awfully
disgusted
.
``
If
I
am
to
do
any
*NL*
good
here
and
preserve
my
position
,
''
he
said
,
taking
his
seat
by
my
*NL*
side
in
the
boat
,
``
I
must
stand
the
risk
:
I
take
it
once
every
month
,
at
*NL*
least
.
Many
people
trust
me
to
do
that
--
for
them
.
Afraid
of
me
!
That
's
*NL*
just
it
.
Most
likely
he
is
afraid
of
me
because
I
am
not
afraid
of
his
*NL*
coffee
.
''
Then
showing
me
a
place
on
the
north
front
of
the
stockade
*NL*
where
the
pointed
tops
of
several
stakes
were
broken
,
``
This
is
where
*NL*
I
leaped
over
on
my
third
day
in
Patusan
.
They
have
n't
put
new
stakes
*NL*
there
yet
.
Good
leap
,
eh
?
''
A
moment
later
we
passed
the
mouth
of
a
muddy
*NL*
creek
.
``
This
is
my
second
leap
.
I
had
a
bit
of
a
run
and
took
this
one
*NL*
flying
,
but
fell
short
.
Thought
I
would
leave
my
skin
there
.
Lost
my
*NL*
shoes
struggling
.
And
all
the
time
I
was
thinking
to
myself
how
beastly
*NL*
it
would
be
to
get
a
jab
with
a
bally
long
spear
while
sticking
in
the
*NL*
mud
like
this
.
I
remember
how
sick
I
felt
wriggling
in
that
slime
.
I
*NL*
mean
really
sick
--
as
if
I
had
bitten
something
rotten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
how
it
was
--
and
the
opportunity
ran
by
his
side
,
leaped
over
the
*NL*
gap
,
floundered
in
the
mud
...
still
veiled
.
The
unexpectedness
of
his
*NL*
coming
was
the
only
thing
,
you
understand
,
that
saved
him
from
being
at
*NL*
once
dispatched
with
krisses
and
flung
into
the
river
.
They
had
him
,
but
*NL*
it
was
like
getting
hold
of
an
apparition
,
a
wraith
,
a
portent
.
What
did
*NL*
it
mean
?
What
to
do
with
it
?
Was
it
too
late
to
conciliate
him
?
Had
n't
*NL*
he
better
be
killed
without
more
delay
?
But
what
would
happen
then
?
*NL*
Wretched
old
Allang
went
nearly
mad
with
apprehension
and
through
the
*NL*
difficulty
of
making
up
his
mind
.
Several
times
the
council
was
broken
*NL*
up
,
and
the
advisers
made
a
break
helter-skelter
for
the
door
and
out
*NL*
on
to
the
verandah
.
One
--
it
is
said
--
even
jumped
down
to
the
*NL*
ground
--
fifteen
feet
,
I
should
judge
--
and
broke
his
leg
.
The
royal
*NL*
governor
of
Patusan
had
bizarre
mannerisms
,
and
one
of
them
was
to
*NL*
introduce
boastful
rhapsodies
into
every
arduous
discussion
,
when
,
*NL*
getting
gradually
excited
,
he
would
end
by
flying
off
his
perch
with
a
*NL*
kriss
in
his
hand
.
But
,
barring
such
interruptions
,
the
deliberations
*NL*
upon
Jim
's
fate
went
on
night
and
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Meanwhile
he
wandered
about
the
courtyard
,
shunned
by
some
,
glared
at
*NL*
by
others
,
but
watched
by
all
,
and
practically
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
*NL*
casual
ragamuffin
with
a
chopper
,
in
there
.
He
took
possession
of
a
*NL*
small
tumble-down
shed
to
sleep
in
;
the
effluvia
of
filth
and
rotten
*NL*
matter
incommoded
him
greatly
:
it
seems
he
had
not
lost
his
appetite
*NL*
though
,
because
--
he
told
me
--
he
had
been
hungry
all
the
blessed
time
.
*NL*
Now
and
again
``
some
fussy
ass
''
deputed
from
the
council-room
would
*NL*
come
out
running
to
him
,
and
in
honeyed
tones
would
administer
amazing
*NL*
interrogatories
:
``
Were
the
Dutch
coming
to
take
the
country
?
Would
the
*NL*
white
man
like
to
go
back
down
the
river
?
What
was
the
object
of
coming
*NL*
to
such
a
miserable
country
?
The
Rajah
wanted
to
know
whether
the
white
*NL*
man
could
repair
a
watch
?
''
They
did
actually
bring
out
to
him
a
nickel
*NL*
clock
of
New
England
make
,
and
out
of
sheer
unbearable
boredom
he
busied
*NL*
himself
in
trying
to
get
the
alarum
to
work
.
It
was
apparently
when
*NL*
thus
occupied
in
his
shed
that
the
true
perception
of
his
extreme
peril
*NL*
dawned
upon
him
.
He
dropped
the
thing
--
he
says
--
``
like
a
hot
potato
,
''
*NL*
and
walked
out
hastily
,
without
the
slightest
idea
of
what
he
would
,
*NL*
or
indeed
could
,
do
.
He
only
knew
that
the
position
was
intolerable
.
He
*NL*
strolled
aimlessly
beyond
a
sort
of
ramshackle
little
granary
on
posts
,
*NL*
and
his
eyes
fell
on
the
broken
stakes
of
the
palisade
;
and
then
--
he
*NL*
says
--
at
once
,
without
any
mental
process
as
it
were
,
without
any
stir
*NL*
of
emotion
,
he
set
about
his
escape
as
if
executing
a
plan
matured
for
a
*NL*
month
.
He
walked
off
carelessly
to
give
himself
a
good
run
,
and
when
he
*NL*
faced
about
there
was
some
dignitary
,
with
two
spearmen
in
attendance
,
*NL*
close
at
his
elbow
ready
with
a
question
.
He
started
off
``
from
under
his
*NL*
very
nose
,
''
went
over
``
like
a
bird
,
''
and
landed
on
the
other
side
with
*NL*
a
fall
that
jarred
all
his
bones
and
seemed
to
split
his
head
.
He
picked
*NL*
himself
up
instantly
.
He
never
thought
of
anything
at
the
time
;
all
he
*NL*
could
remember
--
he
said
--
was
a
great
yell
;
the
first
houses
of
Patusan
*NL*
were
before
him
four
hundred
yards
away
;
he
saw
the
creek
,
and
as
it
*NL*
were
mechanically
put
on
more
pace
.
The
earth
seemed
fairly
to
fly
*NL*
backwards
under
his
feet
.
He
took
off
from
the
last
dry
spot
,
felt
*NL*
himself
flying
through
the
air
,
felt
himself
,
without
any
shock
,
planted
*NL*
upright
in
an
extremely
soft
and
sticky
mudbank
.
It
was
only
when
he
*NL*
tried
to
move
his
legs
and
found
he
could
n't
that
,
in
his
own
words
,
*NL*
``
he
came
to
himself
.
''
He
began
to
think
of
the
``
bally
long
spears
.
''
As
*NL*
a
matter
of
fact
,
considering
that
the
people
inside
the
stockade
had
to
*NL*
run
to
the
gate
,
then
get
down
to
the
landing-place
,
get
into
boats
,
*NL*
and
pull
round
a
point
of
land
,
he
had
more
advance
than
he
imagined
.
*NL*
Besides
,
it
being
low
water
,
the
creek
was
without
water
--
you
could
n't
*NL*
call
it
dry
--
and
practically
he
was
safe
for
a
time
from
everything
but
*NL*
a
very
long
shot
perhaps
.
The
higher
firm
ground
was
about
six
feet
in
*NL*
front
of
him
.
``
I
thought
I
would
have
to
die
there
all
the
same
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
He
reached
and
grabbed
desperately
with
his
hands
,
and
only
*NL*
succeeded
in
gathering
a
horrible
cold
shiny
heap
of
slime
against
his
*NL*
breast
--
up
to
his
very
chin
.
It
seemed
to
him
he
was
burying
himself
*NL*
alive
,
and
then
he
struck
out
madly
,
scattering
the
mud
with
his
fists
.
*NL*
It
fell
on
his
head
,
on
his
face
,
over
his
eyes
,
into
his
mouth
.
He
told
*NL*
me
that
he
remembered
suddenly
the
courtyard
,
as
you
remember
a
place
*NL*
where
you
had
been
very
happy
years
ago
.
He
longed
--
so
he
said
--
to
be
*NL*
back
there
again
,
mending
the
clock
.
Mending
the
clock
--
that
was
the
*NL*
idea
.
He
made
efforts
,
tremendous
sobbing
,
gasping
efforts
,
efforts
that
*NL*
seemed
to
burst
his
eyeballs
in
their
sockets
and
make
him
blind
,
and
*NL*
culminating
into
one
mighty
supreme
effort
in
the
darkness
to
crack
the
*NL*
earth
asunder
,
to
throw
it
off
his
limbs
--
and
he
felt
himself
creeping
*NL*
feebly
up
the
bank
.
He
lay
full
length
on
the
firm
ground
and
saw
the
*NL*
light
,
the
sky
.
Then
as
a
sort
of
happy
thought
the
notion
came
to
him
*NL*
that
he
would
go
to
sleep
.
He
will
have
it
that
he
_
did
_
actually
go
to
*NL*
sleep
;
that
he
slept
--
perhaps
for
a
minute
,
perhaps
for
twenty
seconds
,
*NL*
or
only
for
one
second
,
but
he
recollects
distinctly
the
violent
*NL*
convulsive
start
of
awakening
.
He
remained
lying
still
for
a
while
,
and
*NL*
then
he
arose
muddy
from
head
to
foot
and
stood
there
,
thinking
he
*NL*
was
alone
of
his
kind
for
hundreds
of
miles
,
alone
,
with
no
help
,
no
*NL*
sympathy
,
no
pity
to
expect
from
any
one
,
like
a
hunted
animal
.
The
*NL*
first
houses
were
not
more
than
twenty
yards
from
him
;
and
it
was
the
*NL*
desperate
screaming
of
a
frightened
woman
trying
to
carry
off
a
child
*NL*
that
started
him
again
.
He
pelted
straight
on
in
his
socks
,
beplastered
*NL*
with
filth
out
of
all
semblance
to
a
human
being
.
He
traversed
more
*NL*
than
half
the
length
of
the
settlement
.
The
nimbler
women
fled
right
and
*NL*
left
,
the
slower
men
just
dropped
whatever
they
had
in
their
hands
,
and
*NL*
remained
petrified
with
dropping
jaws
.
He
was
a
flying
terror
.
He
says
*NL*
he
noticed
the
little
children
trying
to
run
for
life
,
falling
on
their
*NL*
little
stomachs
and
kicking
.
He
swerved
between
two
houses
up
a
slope
,
*NL*
clambered
in
desperation
over
a
barricade
of
felled
trees
-LRB-
there
was
n't
*NL*
a
week
without
some
fight
in
Patusan
at
that
time
-RRB-
,
burst
through
a
*NL*
fence
into
a
maize-patch
,
where
a
scared
boy
flung
a
stick
at
him
,
*NL*
blundered
upon
a
path
,
and
ran
all
at
once
into
the
arms
of
several
*NL*
startled
men
.
He
just
had
breath
enough
to
gasp
out
,
``
Doramin
!
Doramin
!
''
*NL*
He
remembers
being
half-carried
,
half-rushed
to
the
top
of
the
slope
,
*NL*
and
in
a
vast
enclosure
with
palms
and
fruit
trees
being
run
up
to
a
*NL*
large
man
sitting
massively
in
a
chair
in
the
midst
of
the
greatest
*NL*
possible
commotion
and
excitement
.
He
fumbled
in
mud
and
clothes
to
*NL*
produce
the
ring
,
and
,
finding
himself
suddenly
on
his
back
,
wondered
*NL*
who
had
knocked
him
down
.
They
had
simply
let
him
go
--
do
n't
you
*NL*
know
?
--
but
he
could
n't
stand
.
At
the
foot
of
the
slope
random
shots
were
*NL*
fired
,
and
above
the
roofs
of
the
settlement
there
rose
a
dull
roar
of
*NL*
amazement
.
But
he
was
safe
.
Doramin
's
people
were
barricading
the
gate
*NL*
and
pouring
water
down
his
throat
;
Doramin
's
old
wife
,
full
of
business
*NL*
and
commiseration
,
was
issuing
shrill
orders
to
her
girls
.
``
The
old
*NL*
woman
,
''
he
said
softly
,
``
made
a
to-do
over
me
as
if
I
had
been
her
own
*NL*
son
.
They
put
me
into
an
immense
bed
--
her
state
bed
--
and
she
ran
in
*NL*
and
out
wiping
her
eyes
to
give
me
pats
on
the
back
.
I
must
have
been
a
*NL*
pitiful
object
.
I
just
lay
there
like
a
log
for
I
do
n't
know
how
long

*NL*
`
He
seemed
to
have
a
great
liking
for
Doramin
's
old
wife
.
She
on
her
*NL*
side
had
taken
a
motherly
fancy
to
him
.
She
had
a
round
,
nut-brown
,
*NL*
soft
face
,
all
fine
wrinkles
,
large
,
bright
red
lips
-LRB-
she
chewed
*NL*
betel
assiduously
-RRB-
,
and
screwed
up
,
winking
,
benevolent
eyes
.
She
was
*NL*
constantly
in
movement
,
scolding
busily
and
ordering
unceasingly
a
troop
*NL*
of
young
women
with
clear
brown
faces
and
big
grave
eyes
,
her
daughters
,
*NL*
her
servants
,
her
slave-girls
.
You
know
how
it
is
in
these
households
:
*NL*
it
's
generally
impossible
to
tell
the
difference
.
She
was
very
spare
,
*NL*
and
even
her
ample
outer
garment
,
fastened
in
front
with
jewelled
*NL*
clasps
,
had
somehow
a
skimpy
effect
.
Her
dark
bare
feet
were
thrust
into
*NL*
yellow
straw
slippers
of
Chinese
make
.
I
have
seen
her
myself
flitting
*NL*
about
with
her
extremely
thick
,
long
,
grey
hair
falling
about
her
*NL*
shoulders
.
She
uttered
homely
shrewd
sayings
,
was
of
noble
birth
,
and
*NL*
was
eccentric
and
arbitrary
.
In
the
afternoon
she
would
sit
in
a
very
*NL*
roomy
arm-chair
,
opposite
her
husband
,
gazing
steadily
through
a
wide
*NL*
opening
in
the
wall
which
gave
an
extensive
view
of
the
settlement
and
*NL*
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
invariably
tucked
up
her
feet
under
her
,
but
old
Doramin
sat
*NL*
squarely
,
sat
imposingly
as
a
mountain
sits
on
a
plain
.
He
was
only
*NL*
of
the
nakhoda
or
merchant
class
,
but
the
respect
shown
to
him
and
*NL*
the
dignity
of
his
bearing
were
very
striking
.
He
was
the
chief
of
*NL*
the
second
power
in
Patusan
.
The
immigrants
from
Celebes
-LRB-
about
sixty
*NL*
families
that
,
with
dependants
and
so
on
,
could
muster
some
two
hundred
*NL*
men
``
wearing
the
kriss
''
-RRB-
had
elected
him
years
ago
for
their
head
.
The
*NL*
men
of
that
race
are
intelligent
,
enterprising
,
revengeful
,
but
with
a
*NL*
more
frank
courage
than
the
other
Malays
,
and
restless
under
oppression
.
*NL*
They
formed
the
party
opposed
to
the
Rajah
.
Of
course
the
quarrels
were
*NL*
for
trade
.
This
was
the
primary
cause
of
faction
fights
,
of
the
sudden
*NL*
outbreaks
that
would
fill
this
or
that
part
of
the
settlement
with
*NL*
smoke
,
flame
,
the
noise
of
shots
and
shrieks
.
Villages
were
burnt
,
men
*NL*
were
dragged
into
the
Rajah
's
stockade
to
be
killed
or
tortured
for
the
*NL*
crime
of
trading
with
anybody
else
but
himself
.
Only
a
day
or
two
before
*NL*
Jim
's
arrival
several
heads
of
households
in
the
very
fishing
village
*NL*
that
was
afterwards
taken
under
his
especial
protection
had
been
driven
*NL*
over
the
cliffs
by
a
party
of
the
Rajah
's
spearmen
,
on
suspicion
of
*NL*
having
been
collecting
edible
birds
'
nests
for
a
Celebes
trader
.
Rajah
*NL*
Allang
pretended
to
be
the
only
trader
in
his
country
,
and
the
penalty
*NL*
for
the
breach
of
the
monopoly
was
death
;
but
his
idea
of
trading
was
*NL*
indistinguishable
from
the
commonest
forms
of
robbery
.
His
cruelty
and
*NL*
rapacity
had
no
other
bounds
than
his
cowardice
,
and
he
was
afraid
of
*NL*
the
organised
power
of
the
Celebes
men
,
only
--
till
Jim
came
--
he
was
not
*NL*
afraid
enough
to
keep
quiet
.
He
struck
at
them
through
his
subjects
,
and
*NL*
thought
himself
pathetically
in
the
right
.
The
situation
was
complicated
*NL*
by
a
wandering
stranger
,
an
Arab
half-breed
,
who
,
I
believe
,
on
*NL*
purely
religious
grounds
,
had
incited
the
tribes
in
the
interior
-LRB-
the
*NL*
bush-folk
,
as
Jim
himself
called
them
-RRB-
to
rise
,
and
had
established
*NL*
himself
in
a
fortified
camp
on
the
summit
of
one
of
the
twin
hills
.
He
*NL*
hung
over
the
town
of
Patusan
like
a
hawk
over
a
poultry-yard
,
but
he
*NL*
devastated
the
open
country
.
Whole
villages
,
deserted
,
rotted
on
their
*NL*
blackened
posts
over
the
banks
of
clear
streams
,
dropping
piecemeal
into
*NL*
the
water
the
grass
of
their
walls
,
the
leaves
of
their
roofs
,
with
a
*NL*
curious
effect
of
natural
decay
as
if
they
had
been
a
form
of
vegetation
*NL*
stricken
by
a
blight
at
its
very
root
.
The
two
parties
in
Patusan
were
*NL*
not
sure
which
one
this
partisan
most
desired
to
plunder
.
The
Rajah
*NL*
intrigued
with
him
feebly
.
Some
of
the
Bugis
settlers
,
weary
with
*NL*
endless
insecurity
,
were
half
inclined
to
call
him
in
.
The
younger
*NL*
spirits
amongst
them
,
chaffing
,
advised
to
``
get
Sherif
Ali
with
his
wild
*NL*
men
and
drive
the
Rajah
Allang
out
of
the
country
.
''
Doramin
restrained
*NL*
them
with
difficulty
.
He
was
growing
old
,
and
,
though
his
influence
had
*NL*
not
diminished
,
the
situation
was
getting
beyond
him
.
This
was
the
state
*NL*
of
affairs
when
Jim
,
bolting
from
the
Rajah
's
stockade
,
appeared
before
*NL*
the
chief
of
the
Bugis
,
produced
the
ring
,
and
was
received
,
in
a
manner
*NL*
of
speaking
,
into
the
heart
of
the
community
.

CHAPTER
26
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Doramin
was
one
of
the
most
remarkable
men
of
his
race
I
had
ever
seen
.
*NL*
His
bulk
for
a
Malay
was
immense
,
but
he
did
not
look
merely
fat
;
he
*NL*
looked
imposing
,
monumental
.
This
motionless
body
,
clad
in
rich
stuffs
,
*NL*
coloured
silks
,
gold
embroideries
;
this
huge
head
,
enfolded
in
a
*NL*
red-and-gold
headkerchief
;
the
flat
,
big
,
round
face
,
wrinkled
,
*NL*
furrowed
,
with
two
semicircular
heavy
folds
starting
on
each
side
of
*NL*
wide
,
fierce
nostrils
,
and
enclosing
a
thick-lipped
mouth
;
the
throat
*NL*
like
a
bull
;
the
vast
corrugated
brow
overhanging
the
staring
proud
*NL*
eyes
--
made
a
whole
that
,
once
seen
,
can
never
be
forgotten
.
His
*NL*
impassive
repose
-LRB-
he
seldom
stirred
a
limb
when
once
he
sat
down
-RRB-
was
*NL*
like
a
display
of
dignity
.
He
was
never
known
to
raise
his
voice
.
It
*NL*
was
a
hoarse
and
powerful
murmur
,
slightly
veiled
as
if
heard
from
a
*NL*
distance
.
When
he
walked
,
two
short
,
sturdy
young
fellows
,
naked
to
the
*NL*
waist
,
in
white
sarongs
and
with
black
skull-caps
on
the
backs
of
their
*NL*
heads
,
sustained
his
elbows
;
they
would
ease
him
down
and
stand
behind
*NL*
his
chair
till
he
wanted
to
rise
,
when
he
would
turn
his
head
slowly
,
*NL*
as
if
with
difficulty
,
to
the
right
and
to
the
left
,
and
then
they
would
*NL*
catch
him
under
his
armpits
and
help
him
up
.
For
all
that
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
of
a
cripple
about
him
:
on
the
contrary
,
all
his
ponderous
*NL*
movements
were
like
manifestations
of
a
mighty
deliberate
force
.
It
*NL*
was
generally
believed
he
consulted
his
wife
as
to
public
affairs
;
but
*NL*
nobody
,
as
far
as
I
know
,
had
ever
heard
them
exchange
a
single
word
.
*NL*
When
they
sat
in
state
by
the
wide
opening
it
was
in
silence
.
They
could
*NL*
see
below
them
in
the
declining
light
the
vast
expanse
of
the
forest
*NL*
country
,
a
dark
sleeping
sea
of
sombre
green
undulating
as
far
as
the
*NL*
violet
and
purple
range
of
mountains
;
the
shining
sinuosity
of
the
river
*NL*
like
an
immense
letter
S
of
beaten
silver
;
the
brown
ribbon
of
houses
*NL*
following
the
sweep
of
both
banks
,
overtopped
by
the
twin
hills
uprising
*NL*
above
the
nearer
tree-tops
.
They
were
wonderfully
contrasted
:
she
,
*NL*
light
,
delicate
,
spare
,
quick
,
a
little
witch-like
,
with
a
touch
of
*NL*
motherly
fussiness
in
her
repose
;
he
,
facing
her
,
immense
and
heavy
,
*NL*
like
a
figure
of
a
man
roughly
fashioned
of
stone
,
with
something
*NL*
magnanimous
and
ruthless
in
his
immobility
.
The
son
of
these
old
people
*NL*
was
a
most
distinguished
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
had
him
late
in
life
.
Perhaps
he
was
not
really
so
young
as
he
*NL*
looked
.
Four
-
or
five-and-twenty
is
not
so
young
when
a
man
is
already
*NL*
father
of
a
family
at
eighteen
.
When
he
entered
the
large
room
,
lined
*NL*
and
carpeted
with
fine
mats
,
and
with
a
high
ceiling
of
white
sheeting
,
*NL*
where
the
couple
sat
in
state
surrounded
by
a
most
deferential
retinue
,
*NL*
he
would
make
his
way
straight
to
Doramin
,
to
kiss
his
hand
--
which
the
*NL*
other
abandoned
to
him
,
majestically
--
and
then
would
step
across
to
*NL*
stand
by
his
mother
's
chair
.
I
suppose
I
may
say
they
idolised
him
,
but
*NL*
I
never
caught
them
giving
him
an
overt
glance
.
Those
,
it
is
true
,
were
*NL*
public
functions
.
The
room
was
generally
thronged
.
The
solemn
formality
*NL*
of
greetings
and
leave-takings
,
the
profound
respect
expressed
in
*NL*
gestures
,
on
the
faces
,
in
the
low
whispers
,
is
simply
indescribable
.
*NL*
``
It
's
well
worth
seeing
,
''
Jim
had
assured
me
while
we
were
crossing
the
*NL*
river
,
on
our
way
back
.
``
They
are
like
people
in
a
book
,
are
n't
they
?
''
*NL*
he
said
triumphantly
.
``
And
Dain
Waris
--
their
son
--
is
the
best
*NL*
friend
-LRB-
barring
you
-RRB-
I
ever
had
.
What
Mr.
Stein
would
call
a
good
*NL*
`
war-comrade
.
'
I
was
in
luck
.
Jove
!
I
was
in
luck
when
I
tumbled
amongst
*NL*
them
at
my
last
gasp
.
''
He
meditated
with
bowed
head
,
then
rousing
*NL*
himself
he
added
--
'
``
Of
course
I
did
n't
go
to
sleep
over
it
,
but
...
''
*NL*
He
paused
again
.
``
It
seemed
to
come
to
me
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
All
at
once
I
*NL*
saw
what
I
had
to
do
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
was
no
doubt
that
it
had
come
to
him
;
and
it
had
come
through
*NL*
war
,
too
,
as
is
natural
,
since
this
power
that
came
to
him
was
the
power
*NL*
to
make
peace
.
It
is
in
this
sense
alone
that
might
so
often
is
right
.
*NL*
You
must
not
think
he
had
seen
his
way
at
once
.
When
he
arrived
the
*NL*
Bugis
community
was
in
a
most
critical
position
.
``
They
were
all
afraid
,
''
*NL*
he
said
to
me
--
``
each
man
afraid
for
himself
;
while
I
could
see
as
plain
*NL*
as
possible
that
they
must
do
something
at
once
,
if
they
did
not
want
*NL*
to
go
under
one
after
another
,
what
between
the
Rajah
and
that
vagabond
*NL*
Sherif
.
''
But
to
see
that
was
nothing
.
When
he
got
his
idea
he
had
*NL*
to
drive
it
into
reluctant
minds
,
through
the
bulwarks
of
fear
,
of
*NL*
selfishness
.
He
drove
it
in
at
last
.
And
that
was
nothing
.
He
had
to
*NL*
devise
the
means
.
He
devised
them
--
an
audacious
plan
;
and
his
task
*NL*
was
only
half
done
.
He
had
to
inspire
with
his
own
confidence
a
lot
*NL*
of
people
who
had
hidden
and
absurd
reasons
to
hang
back
;
he
had
to
*NL*
conciliate
imbecile
jealousies
,
and
argue
away
all
sorts
of
senseless
*NL*
mistrusts
.
Without
the
weight
of
Doramin
's
authority
,
and
his
son
's
*NL*
fiery
enthusiasm
,
he
would
have
failed
.
Dain
Waris
,
the
distinguished
*NL*
youth
,
was
the
first
to
believe
in
him
;
theirs
was
one
of
those
strange
,
*NL*
profound
,
rare
friendships
between
brown
and
white
,
in
which
the
very
*NL*
difference
of
race
seems
to
draw
two
human
beings
closer
by
some
mystic
*NL*
element
of
sympathy
.
Of
Dain
Waris
,
his
own
people
said
with
pride
that
*NL*
he
knew
how
to
fight
like
a
white
man
.
This
was
true
;
he
had
that
*NL*
sort
of
courage
--
the
courage
in
the
open
,
I
may
say
--
but
he
had
also
a
*NL*
European
mind
.
You
meet
them
sometimes
like
that
,
and
are
surprised
to
*NL*
discover
unexpectedly
a
familiar
turn
of
thought
,
an
unobscured
vision
,
*NL*
a
tenacity
of
purpose
,
a
touch
of
altruism
.
Of
small
stature
,
but
*NL*
admirably
well
proportioned
,
Dain
Waris
had
a
proud
carriage
,
a
*NL*
polished
,
easy
bearing
,
a
temperament
like
a
clear
flame
.
His
dusky
*NL*
face
,
with
big
black
eyes
,
was
in
action
expressive
,
and
in
repose
*NL*
thoughtful
.
He
was
of
a
silent
disposition
;
a
firm
glance
,
an
ironic
*NL*
smile
,
a
courteous
deliberation
of
manner
seemed
to
hint
at
great
*NL*
reserves
of
intelligence
and
power
.
Such
beings
open
to
the
Western
eye
,
*NL*
so
often
concerned
with
mere
surfaces
,
the
hidden
possibilities
of
races
*NL*
and
lands
over
which
hangs
the
mystery
of
unrecorded
ages
.
He
not
only
*NL*
trusted
Jim
,
he
understood
him
,
I
firmly
believe
.
I
speak
of
him
because
*NL*
he
had
captivated
me
.
His
--
if
I
may
say
so
--
his
caustic
placidity
,
*NL*
and
,
at
the
same
time
,
his
intelligent
sympathy
with
Jim
's
aspirations
,
*NL*
appealed
to
me
.
I
seemed
to
behold
the
very
origin
of
friendship
.
If
*NL*
Jim
took
the
lead
,
the
other
had
captivated
his
leader
.
In
fact
,
Jim
*NL*
the
leader
was
a
captive
in
every
sense
.
The
land
,
the
people
,
the
*NL*
friendship
,
the
love
,
were
like
the
jealous
guardians
of
his
body
.
*NL*
Every
day
added
a
link
to
the
fetters
of
that
strange
freedom
.
I
felt
*NL*
convinced
of
it
,
as
from
day
to
day
I
learned
more
of
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
story
!
Have
n't
I
heard
the
story
?
I
've
heard
it
on
the
march
,
in
*NL*
camp
-LRB-
he
made
me
scour
the
country
after
invisible
game
-RRB-
;
I
've
listened
*NL*
to
a
good
part
of
it
on
one
of
the
twin
summits
,
after
climbing
the
last
*NL*
hundred
feet
or
so
on
my
hands
and
knees
.
Our
escort
-LRB-
we
had
volunteer
*NL*
followers
from
village
to
village
-RRB-
had
camped
meantime
on
a
bit
of
level
*NL*
ground
half-way
up
the
slope
,
and
in
the
still
breathless
evening
the
*NL*
smell
of
wood-smoke
reached
our
nostrils
from
below
with
the
penetrating
*NL*
delicacy
of
some
choice
scent
.
Voices
also
ascended
,
wonderful
in
their
*NL*
distinct
and
immaterial
clearness
.
Jim
sat
on
the
trunk
of
a
felled
*NL*
tree
,
and
pulling
out
his
pipe
began
to
smoke
.
A
new
growth
of
grass
and
*NL*
bushes
was
springing
up
;
there
were
traces
of
an
earthwork
under
a
mass
*NL*
of
thorny
twigs
.
``
It
all
started
from
here
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
long
and
*NL*
meditative
silence
.
On
the
other
hill
,
two
hundred
yards
across
a
sombre
*NL*
precipice
,
I
saw
a
line
of
high
blackened
stakes
,
showing
here
and
there
*NL*
ruinously
--
the
remnants
of
Sherif
Ali
's
impregnable
camp
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
it
had
been
taken
,
though
.
That
had
been
his
idea
.
He
had
*NL*
mounted
Doramin
's
old
ordnance
on
the
top
of
that
hill
;
two
rusty
iron
*NL*
7-pounders
,
a
lot
of
small
brass
cannon
--
currency
cannon
.
But
if
the
*NL*
brass
guns
represent
wealth
,
they
can
also
,
when
crammed
recklessly
to
*NL*
the
muzzle
,
send
a
solid
shot
to
some
little
distance
.
The
thing
was
*NL*
to
get
them
up
there
.
He
showed
me
where
he
had
fastened
the
cables
,
*NL*
explained
how
he
had
improvised
a
rude
capstan
out
of
a
hollowed
log
*NL*
turning
upon
a
pointed
stake
,
indicated
with
the
bowl
of
his
pipe
the
*NL*
outline
of
the
earthwork
.
The
last
hundred
feet
of
the
ascent
had
been
*NL*
the
most
difficult
.
He
had
made
himself
responsible
for
success
on
his
*NL*
own
head
.
He
had
induced
the
war
party
to
work
hard
all
night
.
Big
*NL*
fires
lighted
at
intervals
blazed
all
down
the
slope
,
``
but
up
here
,
''
he
*NL*
explained
,
``
the
hoisting
gang
had
to
fly
around
in
the
dark
.
''
From
the
*NL*
top
he
saw
men
moving
on
the
hillside
like
ants
at
work
.
He
himself
on
*NL*
that
night
had
kept
on
rushing
down
and
climbing
up
like
a
squirrel
,
*NL*
directing
,
encouraging
,
watching
all
along
the
line
.
Old
Doramin
had
*NL*
himself
carried
up
the
hill
in
his
arm-chair
.
They
put
him
down
on
the
*NL*
level
place
upon
the
slope
,
and
he
sat
there
in
the
light
of
one
of
the
*NL*
big
fires
--
``
amazing
old
chap
--
real
old
chieftain
,
''
said
Jim
,
``
with
his
*NL*
little
fierce
eyes
--
a
pair
of
immense
flintlock
pistols
on
his
knees
.
*NL*
Magnificent
things
,
ebony
,
silver-mounted
,
with
beautiful
locks
and
*NL*
a
calibre
like
an
old
blunderbuss
.
A
present
from
Stein
,
it
seems
--
in
*NL*
exchange
for
that
ring
,
you
know
.
Used
to
belong
to
good
old
McNeil
.
God
*NL*
only
knows
how
_
he
_
came
by
them
.
There
he
sat
,
moving
neither
hand
nor
*NL*
foot
,
a
flame
of
dry
brushwood
behind
him
,
and
lots
of
people
rushing
*NL*
about
,
shouting
and
pulling
round
him
--
the
most
solemn
,
imposing
old
*NL*
chap
you
can
imagine
.
He
would
n't
have
had
much
chance
if
Sherif
Ali
had
*NL*
let
his
infernal
crew
loose
at
us
and
stampeded
my
lot
.
Eh
?
Anyhow
,
he
*NL*
had
come
up
there
to
die
if
anything
went
wrong
.
No
mistake
!
Jove
!
It
*NL*
thrilled
me
to
see
him
there
--
like
a
rock
.
But
the
Sherif
must
have
*NL*
thought
us
mad
,
and
never
troubled
to
come
and
see
how
we
got
on
.
Nobody
*NL*
believed
it
could
be
done
.
Why
!
I
think
the
very
chaps
who
pulled
and
*NL*
shoved
and
sweated
over
it
did
not
believe
it
could
be
done
!
Upon
my
*NL*
word
I
do
n't
think
they
did
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
stood
erect
,
the
smouldering
brier-wood
in
his
clutch
,
with
a
smile
*NL*
on
his
lips
and
a
sparkle
in
his
boyish
eyes
.
I
sat
on
the
stump
of
a
*NL*
tree
at
his
feet
,
and
below
us
stretched
the
land
,
the
great
expanse
of
*NL*
the
forests
,
sombre
under
the
sunshine
,
rolling
like
a
sea
,
with
glints
*NL*
of
winding
rivers
,
the
grey
spots
of
villages
,
and
here
and
there
a
*NL*
clearing
,
like
an
islet
of
light
amongst
the
dark
waves
of
continuous
*NL*
tree-tops
.
A
brooding
gloom
lay
over
this
vast
and
monotonous
landscape
;
*NL*
the
light
fell
on
it
as
if
into
an
abyss
.
The
land
devoured
the
*NL*
sunshine
;
only
far
off
,
along
the
coast
,
the
empty
ocean
,
smooth
and
*NL*
polished
within
the
faint
haze
,
seemed
to
rise
up
to
the
sky
in
a
wall
*NL*
of
steel
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
there
I
was
with
him
,
high
in
the
sunshine
on
the
top
of
that
*NL*
historic
hill
of
his
.
He
dominated
the
forest
,
the
secular
gloom
,
the
*NL*
old
mankind
.
He
was
like
a
figure
set
up
on
a
pedestal
,
to
represent
in
*NL*
his
persistent
youth
the
power
,
and
perhaps
the
virtues
,
of
races
that
*NL*
never
grow
old
,
that
have
emerged
from
the
gloom
.
I
do
n't
know
why
he
*NL*
should
always
have
appeared
to
me
symbolic
.
Perhaps
this
is
the
real
*NL*
cause
of
my
interest
in
his
fate
.
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
exactly
*NL*
fair
to
him
to
remember
the
incident
which
had
given
a
new
direction
to
*NL*
his
life
,
but
at
that
very
moment
I
remembered
very
distinctly
.
It
was
*NL*
like
a
shadow
in
the
light
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
27
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Already
the
legend
had
gifted
him
with
supernatural
powers
.
Yes
,
it
*NL*
was
said
,
there
had
been
many
ropes
cunningly
disposed
,
and
a
strange
*NL*
contrivance
that
turned
by
the
efforts
of
many
men
,
and
each
gun
went
*NL*
up
tearing
slowly
through
the
bushes
,
like
a
wild
pig
rooting
its
way
in
*NL*
the
undergrowth
,
but
...
and
the
wisest
shook
their
heads
.
There
was
*NL*
something
occult
in
all
this
,
no
doubt
;
for
what
is
the
strength
of
*NL*
ropes
and
of
men
's
arms
?
There
is
a
rebellious
soul
in
things
which
must
*NL*
be
overcome
by
powerful
charms
and
incantations
.
Thus
old
Sura
--
a
very
*NL*
respectable
householder
of
Patusan
--
with
whom
I
had
a
quiet
chat
one
*NL*
evening
.
However
,
Sura
was
a
professional
sorcerer
also
,
who
attended
*NL*
all
the
rice
sowings
and
reapings
for
miles
around
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
subduing
the
stubborn
souls
of
things
.
This
occupation
he
seemed
to
*NL*
think
a
most
arduous
one
,
and
perhaps
the
souls
of
things
are
more
*NL*
stubborn
than
the
souls
of
men
.
As
to
the
simple
folk
of
outlying
*NL*
villages
,
they
believed
and
said
-LRB-
as
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
-RRB-
that
Jim
had
carried
the
guns
up
the
hill
on
his
back
--
two
at
a
*NL*
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
would
make
Jim
stamp
his
foot
in
vexation
and
exclaim
with
an
*NL*
exasperated
little
laugh
,
``
What
can
you
do
with
such
silly
beggars
?
They
*NL*
will
sit
up
half
the
night
talking
bally
rot
,
and
the
greater
the
lie
*NL*
the
more
they
seem
to
like
it
.
''
You
could
trace
the
subtle
influence
of
*NL*
his
surroundings
in
this
irritation
.
It
was
part
of
his
captivity
.
The
*NL*
earnestness
of
his
denials
was
amusing
,
and
at
last
I
said
,
``
My
dear
*NL*
fellow
,
you
do
n't
suppose
_
I
_
believe
this
.
''
He
looked
at
me
quite
*NL*
startled
.
``
Well
,
no
!
I
suppose
not
,
''
he
said
,
and
burst
into
a
Homeric
*NL*
peal
of
laughter
.
``
Well
,
anyhow
the
guns
were
there
,
and
went
off
all
*NL*
together
at
sunrise
.
Jove
!
You
should
have
seen
the
splinters
fly
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
.
By
his
side
Dain
Waris
,
listening
with
a
quiet
smile
,
dropped
his
*NL*
eyelids
and
shuffled
his
feet
a
little
.
It
appears
that
the
success
in
*NL*
mounting
the
guns
had
given
Jim
's
people
such
a
feeling
of
confidence
*NL*
that
he
ventured
to
leave
the
battery
under
charge
of
two
elderly
Bugis
*NL*
who
had
seen
some
fighting
in
their
day
,
and
went
to
join
Dain
Waris
and
*NL*
the
storming
party
who
were
concealed
in
the
ravine
.
In
the
small
hours
*NL*
they
began
creeping
up
,
and
when
two-thirds
of
the
way
up
,
lay
in
the
*NL*
wet
grass
waiting
for
the
appearance
of
the
sun
,
which
was
the
agreed
*NL*
signal
.
He
told
me
with
what
impatient
anguishing
emotion
he
watched
the
*NL*
swift
coming
of
the
dawn
;
how
,
heated
with
the
work
and
the
climbing
,
*NL*
he
felt
the
cold
dew
chilling
his
very
bones
;
how
afraid
he
was
he
*NL*
would
begin
to
shiver
and
shake
like
a
leaf
before
the
time
came
for
*NL*
the
advance
.
``
It
was
the
slowest
half-hour
in
my
life
,
''
he
declared
.
*NL*
Gradually
the
silent
stockade
came
out
on
the
sky
above
him
.
Men
*NL*
scattered
all
down
the
slope
were
crouching
amongst
the
dark
stones
and
*NL*
dripping
bushes
.
Dain
Waris
was
lying
flattened
by
his
side
.
``
We
*NL*
looked
at
each
other
,
''
Jim
said
,
resting
a
gentle
hand
on
his
friend
's
*NL*
shoulder
.
``
He
smiled
at
me
as
cheery
as
you
please
,
and
I
dared
not
stir
*NL*
my
lips
for
fear
I
would
break
out
into
a
shivering
fit
.
`
Pon
my
word
,
*NL*
it
's
true
!
I
had
been
streaming
with
perspiration
when
we
took
cover
--
so
*NL*
you
may
imagine
...
''
He
declared
,
and
I
believe
him
,
that
he
had
no
*NL*
fears
as
to
the
result
.
He
was
only
anxious
as
to
his
ability
to
repress
*NL*
these
shivers
.
He
did
n't
bother
about
the
result
.
He
was
bound
to
get
to
*NL*
the
top
of
that
hill
and
stay
there
,
whatever
might
happen
.
There
could
*NL*
be
no
going
back
for
him
.
Those
people
had
trusted
him
implicitly
.
Him
*NL*
alone
!
His
bare
word
...
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
remember
how
,
at
this
point
,
he
paused
with
his
eyes
fixed
upon
me
.
*NL*
``
As
far
as
he
knew
,
they
never
had
an
occasion
to
regret
it
yet
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
``
Never
.
He
hoped
to
God
they
never
would
.
Meantime
--
worse
*NL*
luck
!
--
they
had
got
into
the
habit
of
taking
his
word
for
anything
and
*NL*
everything
.
I
could
have
no
idea
!
Why
,
only
the
other
day
an
old
fool
he
*NL*
had
never
seen
in
his
life
came
from
some
village
miles
away
to
find
*NL*
out
if
he
should
divorce
his
wife
.
Fact
.
Solemn
word
.
That
's
the
sort
*NL*
of
thing
...
He
would
n't
have
believed
it
.
Would
I
?
Squatted
on
the
*NL*
verandah
chewing
betel-nut
,
sighing
and
spitting
all
over
the
place
for
*NL*
more
than
an
hour
,
and
as
glum
as
an
undertaker
before
he
came
out
with
*NL*
that
dashed
conundrum
.
That
's
the
kind
of
thing
that
is
n't
so
funny
as
*NL*
it
looks
.
What
was
a
fellow
to
say
?
--
Good
wife
?
--
Yes
.
Good
wife
--
old
*NL*
though
.
Started
a
confounded
long
story
about
some
brass
pots
.
Been
*NL*
living
together
for
fifteen
years
--
twenty
years
--
could
not
tell
.
A
long
,
*NL*
long
time
.
Good
wife
.
Beat
her
a
little
--
not
much
--
just
a
little
,
when
*NL*
she
was
young
.
Had
to
--
for
the
sake
of
his
honour
.
Suddenly
in
her
old
*NL*
age
she
goes
and
lends
three
brass
pots
to
her
sister
's
son
's
wife
,
and
*NL*
begins
to
abuse
him
every
day
in
a
loud
voice
.
His
enemies
jeered
at
*NL*
him
;
his
face
was
utterly
blackened
.
Pots
totally
lost
.
Awfully
cut
up
*NL*
about
it
.
Impossible
to
fathom
a
story
like
that
;
told
him
to
go
home
,
*NL*
and
promised
to
come
along
myself
and
settle
it
all
.
It
's
all
very
well
*NL*
to
grin
,
but
it
was
the
dashedest
nuisance
!
A
day
's
journey
through
the
*NL*
forest
,
another
day
lost
in
coaxing
a
lot
of
silly
villagers
to
get
at
*NL*
the
rights
of
the
affair
.
There
was
the
making
of
a
sanguinary
shindy
*NL*
in
the
thing
.
Every
bally
idiot
took
sides
with
one
family
or
the
other
,
*NL*
and
one
half
of
the
village
was
ready
to
go
for
the
other
half
with
*NL*
anything
that
came
handy
.
Honour
bright
!
No
joke
!
...
Instead
of
*NL*
attending
to
their
bally
crops
.
Got
him
the
infernal
pots
back
of
*NL*
course
--
and
pacified
all
hands
.
No
trouble
to
settle
it
.
Of
course
not
.
*NL*
Could
settle
the
deadliest
quarrel
in
the
country
by
crooking
his
little
*NL*
finger
.
The
trouble
was
to
get
at
the
truth
of
anything
.
Was
not
sure
*NL*
to
this
day
whether
he
had
been
fair
to
all
parties
.
It
worried
him
.
And
*NL*
the
talk
!
Jove
!
There
did
n't
seem
to
be
any
head
or
tail
to
it
.
Rather
*NL*
storm
a
twenty-foot-high
old
stockade
any
day
.
Much
!
Child
's
play
to
*NL*
that
other
job
.
Would
n't
take
so
long
either
.
Well
,
yes
;
a
funny
set
*NL*
out
,
upon
the
whole
--
the
fool
looked
old
enough
to
be
his
grandfather
.
*NL*
But
from
another
point
of
view
it
was
no
joke
.
His
word
decided
*NL*
everything
--
ever
since
the
smashing
of
Sherif
Ali
.
An
awful
*NL*
responsibility
,
''
he
repeated
.
``
No
,
really
--
joking
apart
,
had
it
been
*NL*
three
lives
instead
of
three
rotten
brass
pots
it
would
have
been
the
*NL*
same
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
he
illustrated
the
moral
effect
of
his
victory
in
war
.
It
was
in
*NL*
truth
immense
.
It
had
led
him
from
strife
to
peace
,
and
through
death
*NL*
into
the
innermost
life
of
the
people
;
but
the
gloom
of
the
land
spread
*NL*
out
under
the
sunshine
preserved
its
appearance
of
inscrutable
,
of
*NL*
secular
repose
.
The
sound
of
his
fresh
young
voice
--
it
's
extraordinary
*NL*
how
very
few
signs
of
wear
he
showed
--
floated
lightly
,
and
passed
away
*NL*
over
the
unchanged
face
of
the
forests
like
the
sound
of
the
big
guns
*NL*
on
that
cold
dewy
morning
when
he
had
no
other
concern
on
earth
but
*NL*
the
proper
control
of
the
chills
in
his
body
.
With
the
first
slant
of
*NL*
sun-rays
along
these
immovable
tree-tops
the
summit
of
one
hill
wreathed
*NL*
itself
,
with
heavy
reports
,
in
white
clouds
of
smoke
,
and
the
other
*NL*
burst
into
an
amazing
noise
of
yells
,
war-cries
,
shouts
of
anger
,
of
*NL*
surprise
,
of
dismay
.
Jim
and
Dain
Waris
were
the
first
to
lay
their
*NL*
hands
on
the
stakes
.
The
popular
story
has
it
that
Jim
with
a
touch
*NL*
of
one
finger
had
thrown
down
the
gate
.
He
was
,
of
course
,
anxious
*NL*
to
disclaim
this
achievement
.
The
whole
stockade
--
he
would
insist
on
*NL*
explaining
to
you
--
was
a
poor
affair
-LRB-
Sherif
Ali
trusted
mainly
to
the
*NL*
inaccessible
position
-RRB-
;
and
,
anyway
,
the
thing
had
been
already
knocked
*NL*
to
pieces
and
only
hung
together
by
a
miracle
.
He
put
his
shoulder
to
it
*NL*
like
a
little
fool
and
went
in
head
over
heels
.
Jove
!
If
it
had
n't
been
*NL*
for
Dain
Waris
,
a
pock-marked
tattooed
vagabond
would
have
pinned
him
*NL*
with
his
spear
to
a
baulk
of
timber
like
one
of
Stein
's
beetles
.
The
*NL*
third
man
in
,
it
seems
,
had
been
Tamb
'
Itam
,
Jim
's
own
servant
.
This
was
*NL*
a
Malay
from
the
north
,
a
stranger
who
had
wandered
into
Patusan
,
and
*NL*
had
been
forcibly
detained
by
Rajah
Allang
as
paddler
of
one
of
the
*NL*
state
boats
.
He
had
made
a
bolt
of
it
at
the
first
opportunity
,
and
*NL*
finding
a
precarious
refuge
-LRB-
but
very
little
to
eat
-RRB-
amongst
the
Bugis
*NL*
settlers
,
had
attached
himself
to
Jim
's
person
.
His
complexion
was
very
*NL*
dark
,
his
face
flat
,
his
eyes
prominent
and
injected
with
bile
.
There
*NL*
was
something
excessive
,
almost
fanatical
,
in
his
devotion
to
his
*NL*
``
white
lord
.
''
He
was
inseparable
from
Jim
like
a
morose
shadow
.
On
state
*NL*
occasions
he
would
tread
on
his
master
's
heels
,
one
hand
on
the
haft
*NL*
of
his
kriss
,
keeping
the
common
people
at
a
distance
by
his
truculent
*NL*
brooding
glances
.
Jim
had
made
him
the
headman
of
his
establishment
,
and
*NL*
all
Patusan
respected
and
courted
him
as
a
person
of
much
influence
.
At
*NL*
the
taking
of
the
stockade
he
had
distinguished
himself
greatly
by
the
*NL*
methodical
ferocity
of
his
fighting
.
The
storming
party
had
come
on
so
*NL*
quick
--
Jim
said
--
that
notwithstanding
the
panic
of
the
garrison
,
there
*NL*
was
a
``
hot
five
minutes
hand-to-hand
inside
that
stockade
,
till
some
*NL*
bally
ass
set
fire
to
the
shelters
of
boughs
and
dry
grass
,
and
we
all
*NL*
had
to
clear
out
for
dear
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
rout
,
it
seems
,
had
been
complete
.
Doramin
,
waiting
immovably
in
*NL*
his
chair
on
the
hillside
,
with
the
smoke
of
the
guns
spreading
slowly
*NL*
above
his
big
head
,
received
the
news
with
a
deep
grunt
.
When
informed
*NL*
that
his
son
was
safe
and
leading
the
pursuit
,
he
,
without
another
*NL*
sound
,
made
a
mighty
effort
to
rise
;
his
attendants
hurried
to
his
help
,
*NL*
and
,
held
up
reverently
,
he
shuffled
with
great
dignity
into
a
bit
of
*NL*
shade
,
where
he
laid
himself
down
to
sleep
,
covered
entirely
with
a
*NL*
piece
of
white
sheeting
.
In
Patusan
the
excitement
was
intense
.
Jim
told
*NL*
me
that
from
the
hill
,
turning
his
back
on
the
stockade
with
its
embers
,
*NL*
black
ashes
,
and
half-consumed
corpses
,
he
could
see
time
after
time
the
*NL*
open
spaces
between
the
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
fill
suddenly
*NL*
with
a
seething
rush
of
people
and
get
empty
in
a
moment
.
His
ears
*NL*
caught
feebly
from
below
the
tremendous
din
of
gongs
and
drums
;
the
wild
*NL*
shouts
of
the
crowd
reached
him
in
bursts
of
faint
roaring
.
A
lot
of
*NL*
streamers
made
a
flutter
as
of
little
white
,
red
,
yellow
birds
amongst
*NL*
the
brown
ridges
of
roofs
.
``
You
must
have
enjoyed
it
,
''
I
murmured
,
*NL*
feeling
the
stir
of
sympathetic
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
It
was
...
it
was
immense
!
Immense
!
''
he
cried
aloud
,
flinging
his
*NL*
arms
open
.
The
sudden
movement
startled
me
as
though
I
had
seen
him
bare
*NL*
the
secrets
of
his
breast
to
the
sunshine
,
to
the
brooding
forests
,
to
*NL*
the
steely
sea
.
Below
us
the
town
reposed
in
easy
curves
upon
the
banks
*NL*
of
a
stream
whose
current
seemed
to
sleep
.
``
Immense
!
''
he
repeated
for
a
*NL*
third
time
,
speaking
in
a
whisper
,
for
himself
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Immense
!
No
doubt
it
was
immense
;
the
seal
of
success
upon
his
words
,
*NL*
the
conquered
ground
for
the
soles
of
his
feet
,
the
blind
trust
of
*NL*
men
,
the
belief
in
himself
snatched
from
the
fire
,
the
solitude
of
his
*NL*
achievement
.
All
this
,
as
I
've
warned
you
,
gets
dwarfed
in
the
telling
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
with
mere
words
convey
to
you
the
impression
of
his
total
and
*NL*
utter
isolation
.
I
know
,
of
course
,
he
was
in
every
sense
alone
of
his
*NL*
kind
there
,
but
the
unsuspected
qualities
of
his
nature
had
brought
him
*NL*
in
such
close
touch
with
his
surroundings
that
this
isolation
seemed
*NL*
only
the
effect
of
his
power
.
His
loneliness
added
to
his
stature
.
There
*NL*
was
nothing
within
sight
to
compare
him
with
,
as
though
he
had
been
one
*NL*
of
those
exceptional
men
who
can
be
only
measured
by
the
greatness
of
*NL*
their
fame
;
and
his
fame
,
remember
,
was
the
greatest
thing
around
for
*NL*
many
a
day
's
journey
.
You
would
have
to
paddle
,
pole
,
or
track
a
long
*NL*
weary
way
through
the
jungle
before
you
passed
beyond
the
reach
of
its
*NL*
voice
.
Its
voice
was
not
the
trumpeting
of
the
disreputable
goddess
we
*NL*
all
know
--
not
blatant
--
not
brazen
.
It
took
its
tone
from
the
stillness
*NL*
and
gloom
of
the
land
without
a
past
,
where
his
word
was
the
one
truth
*NL*
of
every
passing
day
.
It
shared
something
of
the
nature
of
that
*NL*
silence
through
which
it
accompanied
you
into
unexplored
depths
,
heard
*NL*
continuously
by
your
side
,
penetrating
,
far-reaching
--
tinged
with
wonder
*NL*
and
mystery
on
the
lips
of
whispering
men
.

CHAPTER
28
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
defeated
Sherif
Ali
fled
the
country
without
making
another
stand
,
*NL*
and
when
the
miserable
hunted
villagers
began
to
crawl
out
of
the
jungle
*NL*
back
to
their
rotting
houses
,
it
was
Jim
who
,
in
consultation
with
Dain
*NL*
Waris
,
appointed
the
headmen
.
Thus
he
became
the
virtual
ruler
of
the
*NL*
land
.
As
to
old
Tunku
Allang
,
his
fears
at
first
had
known
no
bounds
.
It
*NL*
is
said
that
at
the
intelligence
of
the
successful
storming
of
the
hill
*NL*
he
flung
himself
,
face
down
,
on
the
bamboo
floor
of
his
audience-hall
,
*NL*
and
lay
motionless
for
a
whole
night
and
a
whole
day
,
uttering
stifled
*NL*
sounds
of
such
an
appalling
nature
that
no
man
dared
approach
his
*NL*
prostrate
form
nearer
than
a
spear
's
length
.
Already
he
could
see
*NL*
himself
driven
ignominiously
out
of
Patusan
,
wandering
abandoned
,
*NL*
stripped
,
without
opium
,
without
his
women
,
without
followers
,
a
fair
*NL*
game
for
the
first
comer
to
kill
.
After
Sherif
Ali
his
turn
would
come
,
*NL*
and
who
could
resist
an
attack
led
by
such
a
devil
?
And
indeed
he
owed
*NL*
his
life
and
such
authority
as
he
still
possessed
at
the
time
of
my
*NL*
visit
to
Jim
's
idea
of
what
was
fair
alone
.
The
Bugis
had
been
extremely
*NL*
anxious
to
pay
off
old
scores
,
and
the
impassive
old
Doramin
cherished
*NL*
the
hope
of
yet
seeing
his
son
ruler
of
Patusan
.
During
one
of
our
*NL*
interviews
he
deliberately
allowed
me
to
get
a
glimpse
of
this
secret
*NL*
ambition
.
Nothing
could
be
finer
in
its
way
than
the
dignified
wariness
*NL*
of
his
approaches
.
He
himself
--
he
began
by
declaring
--
had
used
his
*NL*
strength
in
his
young
days
,
but
now
he
had
grown
old
and
tired
...
*NL*
With
his
imposing
bulk
and
haughty
little
eyes
darting
sagacious
,
*NL*
inquisitive
glances
,
he
reminded
one
irresistibly
of
a
cunning
old
*NL*
elephant
;
the
slow
rise
and
fall
of
his
vast
breast
went
on
powerful
and
*NL*
regular
,
like
the
heave
of
a
calm
sea
.
He
too
,
as
he
protested
,
had
an
*NL*
unbounded
confidence
in
Tuan
Jim
's
wisdom
.
If
he
could
only
obtain
a
*NL*
promise
!
One
word
would
be
enough
!
...
His
breathing
silences
,
the
*NL*
low
rumblings
of
his
voice
,
recalled
the
last
efforts
of
a
spent
*NL*
thunderstorm
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
tried
to
put
the
subject
aside
.
It
was
difficult
,
for
there
could
be
*NL*
no
question
that
Jim
had
the
power
;
in
his
new
sphere
there
did
not
seem
*NL*
to
be
anything
that
was
not
his
to
hold
or
to
give
.
But
that
,
I
repeat
,
*NL*
was
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
notion
,
which
occurred
to
me
,
while
I
*NL*
listened
with
a
show
of
attention
,
that
he
seemed
to
have
come
very
near
*NL*
at
last
to
mastering
his
fate
.
Doramin
was
anxious
about
the
future
of
*NL*
the
country
,
and
I
was
struck
by
the
turn
he
gave
to
the
argument
.
The
*NL*
land
remains
where
God
had
put
it
;
but
white
men
--
he
said
--
they
come
to
*NL*
us
and
in
a
little
while
they
go
.
They
go
away
.
Those
they
leave
behind
*NL*
do
not
know
when
to
look
for
their
return
.
They
go
to
their
own
land
,
to
*NL*
their
people
,
and
so
this
white
man
too
would
...
I
do
n't
know
what
*NL*
induced
me
to
commit
myself
at
this
point
by
a
vigorous
``
No
,
no
.
''
The
*NL*
whole
extent
of
this
indiscretion
became
apparent
when
Doramin
,
turning
*NL*
full
upon
me
his
face
,
whose
expression
,
fixed
in
rugged
deep
folds
,
*NL*
remained
unalterable
,
like
a
huge
brown
mask
,
said
that
this
was
good
*NL*
news
indeed
,
reflectively
;
and
then
wanted
to
know
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
little
,
motherly
witch
of
a
wife
sat
on
my
other
hand
,
with
*NL*
her
head
covered
and
her
feet
tucked
up
,
gazing
through
the
great
*NL*
shutter-hole
.
I
could
only
see
a
straying
lock
of
grey
hair
,
a
high
*NL*
cheek-bone
,
the
slight
masticating
motion
of
the
sharp
chin
.
Without
*NL*
removing
her
eyes
from
the
vast
prospect
of
forests
stretching
as
far
as
*NL*
the
hills
,
she
asked
me
in
a
pitying
voice
why
was
it
that
he
so
young
*NL*
had
wandered
from
his
home
,
coming
so
far
,
through
so
many
dangers
?
*NL*
Had
he
no
household
there
,
no
kinsmen
in
his
own
country
?
Had
he
no
old
*NL*
mother
,
who
would
always
remember
his
face
?
...
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
completely
unprepared
for
this
.
I
could
only
mutter
and
shake
my
*NL*
head
vaguely
.
Afterwards
I
am
perfectly
aware
I
cut
a
very
poor
figure
*NL*
trying
to
extricate
myself
out
of
this
difficulty
.
From
that
moment
,
*NL*
however
,
the
old
nakhoda
became
taciturn
.
He
was
not
very
pleased
,
I
*NL*
fear
,
and
evidently
I
had
given
him
food
for
thought
.
Strangely
enough
,
*NL*
on
the
evening
of
that
very
day
-LRB-
which
was
my
last
in
Patusan
-RRB-
I
was
*NL*
once
more
confronted
with
the
same
question
,
with
the
unanswerable
why
*NL*
of
Jim
's
fate
.
And
this
brings
me
to
the
story
of
his
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
you
think
it
is
a
story
that
you
can
imagine
for
yourselves
.
*NL*
We
have
heard
so
many
such
stories
,
and
the
majority
of
us
do
n't
believe
*NL*
them
to
be
stories
of
love
at
all
.
For
the
most
part
we
look
upon
them
*NL*
as
stories
of
opportunities
:
episodes
of
passion
at
best
,
or
perhaps
*NL*
only
of
youth
and
temptation
,
doomed
to
forgetfulness
in
the
end
,
even
*NL*
if
they
pass
through
the
reality
of
tenderness
and
regret
.
This
view
*NL*
mostly
is
right
,
and
perhaps
in
this
case
too
...
Yet
I
do
n't
know
.
*NL*
To
tell
this
story
is
by
no
means
so
easy
as
it
should
be
--
were
the
*NL*
ordinary
standpoint
adequate
.
Apparently
it
is
a
story
very
much
like
*NL*
the
others
:
for
me
,
however
,
there
is
visible
in
its
background
the
*NL*
melancholy
figure
of
a
woman
,
the
shadow
of
a
cruel
wisdom
buried
in
a
*NL*
lonely
grave
,
looking
on
wistfully
,
helplessly
,
with
sealed
lips
.
The
*NL*
grave
itself
,
as
I
came
upon
it
during
an
early
morning
stroll
,
was
a
*NL*
rather
shapeless
brown
mound
,
with
an
inlaid
neat
border
of
white
lumps
*NL*
of
coral
at
the
base
,
and
enclosed
within
a
circular
fence
made
of
split
*NL*
saplings
,
with
the
bark
left
on
.
A
garland
of
leaves
and
flowers
was
*NL*
woven
about
the
heads
of
the
slender
posts
--
and
the
flowers
were
fresh
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
,
whether
the
shadow
is
of
my
imagination
or
not
,
I
can
at
all
*NL*
events
point
out
the
significant
fact
of
an
unforgotten
grave
.
When
I
*NL*
tell
you
besides
that
Jim
with
his
own
hands
had
worked
at
the
rustic
*NL*
fence
,
you
will
perceive
directly
the
difference
,
the
individual
side
of
*NL*
the
story
.
There
is
in
his
espousal
of
memory
and
affection
belonging
to
*NL*
another
human
being
something
characteristic
of
his
seriousness
.
He
had
*NL*
a
conscience
,
and
it
was
a
romantic
conscience
.
Through
her
whole
life
*NL*
the
wife
of
the
unspeakable
Cornelius
had
no
other
companion
,
confidant
,
*NL*
and
friend
but
her
daughter
.
How
the
poor
woman
had
come
to
marry
the
*NL*
awful
little
Malacca
Portuguese
--
after
the
separation
from
the
father
*NL*
of
her
girl
--
and
how
that
separation
had
been
brought
about
,
whether
by
*NL*
death
,
which
can
be
sometimes
merciful
,
or
by
the
merciless
pressure
of
*NL*
conventions
,
is
a
mystery
to
me
.
From
the
little
which
Stein
-LRB-
who
knew
*NL*
so
many
stories
-RRB-
had
let
drop
in
my
hearing
,
I
am
convinced
that
she
was
*NL*
no
ordinary
woman
.
Her
own
father
had
been
a
white
;
a
high
official
;
*NL*
one
of
the
brilliantly
endowed
men
who
are
not
dull
enough
to
nurse
a
*NL*
success
,
and
whose
careers
so
often
end
under
a
cloud
.
I
suppose
she
too
*NL*
must
have
lacked
the
saving
dullness
--
and
her
career
ended
in
Patusan
.
*NL*
Our
common
fate
...
for
where
is
the
man
--
I
mean
a
real
sentient
*NL*
man
--
who
does
not
remember
vaguely
having
been
deserted
in
the
fullness
*NL*
of
possession
by
some
one
or
something
more
precious
than
life
?
...
*NL*
our
common
fate
fastens
upon
the
women
with
a
peculiar
cruelty
.
It
*NL*
does
not
punish
like
a
master
,
but
inflicts
lingering
torment
,
as
if
to
*NL*
gratify
a
secret
,
unappeasable
spite
.
One
would
think
that
,
appointed
*NL*
to
rule
on
earth
,
it
seeks
to
revenge
itself
upon
the
beings
that
come
*NL*
nearest
to
rising
above
the
trammels
of
earthly
caution
;
for
it
is
*NL*
only
women
who
manage
to
put
at
times
into
their
love
an
element
just
*NL*
palpable
enough
to
give
one
a
fright
--
an
extra-terrestrial
touch
.
I
ask
*NL*
myself
with
wonder
--
how
the
world
can
look
to
them
--
whether
it
has
the
*NL*
shape
and
substance
_
we
_
know
,
the
air
_
we
_
breathe
!
Sometimes
I
fancy
*NL*
it
must
be
a
region
of
unreasonable
sublimities
seething
with
the
*NL*
excitement
of
their
adventurous
souls
,
lighted
by
the
glory
of
all
*NL*
possible
risks
and
renunciations
.
However
,
I
suspect
there
are
very
few
*NL*
women
in
the
world
,
though
of
course
I
am
aware
of
the
multitudes
of
*NL*
mankind
and
of
the
equality
of
sexes
--
in
point
of
numbers
,
that
is
.
But
*NL*
I
am
sure
that
the
mother
was
as
much
of
a
woman
as
the
daughter
seemed
*NL*
to
be
.
I
can
not
help
picturing
to
myself
these
two
,
at
first
the
young
*NL*
woman
and
the
child
,
then
the
old
woman
and
the
young
girl
,
the
awful
*NL*
sameness
and
the
swift
passage
of
time
,
the
barrier
of
forest
,
the
*NL*
solitude
and
the
turmoil
round
these
two
lonely
lives
,
and
every
word
*NL*
spoken
between
them
penetrated
with
sad
meaning
.
There
must
have
*NL*
been
confidences
,
not
so
much
of
fact
,
I
suppose
,
as
of
innermost
*NL*
feelings
--
regrets
--
fears
--
warnings
,
no
doubt
:
warnings
that
the
younger
*NL*
did
not
fully
understand
till
the
elder
was
dead
--
and
Jim
came
along
.
*NL*
Then
I
am
sure
she
understood
much
--
not
everything
--
the
fear
mostly
,
it
*NL*
seems
.
Jim
called
her
by
a
word
that
means
precious
,
in
the
sense
of
a
*NL*
precious
gem
--
jewel
.
Pretty
,
is
n't
it
?
But
he
was
capable
of
anything
.
*NL*
He
was
equal
to
his
fortune
,
as
he
--
after
all
--
must
have
been
equal
to
*NL*
his
misfortune
.
Jewel
he
called
her
;
and
he
would
say
this
as
he
might
*NL*
have
said
``
Jane
,
''
do
n't
you
know
--
with
a
marital
,
homelike
,
peaceful
*NL*
effect
.
I
heard
the
name
for
the
first
time
ten
minutes
after
I
had
*NL*
landed
in
his
courtyard
,
when
,
after
nearly
shaking
my
arm
off
,
he
*NL*
darted
up
the
steps
and
began
to
make
a
joyous
,
boyish
disturbance
at
*NL*
the
door
under
the
heavy
eaves
.
``
Jewel
!
O
Jewel
!
Quick
!
Here
's
a
friend
*NL*
come
,
''
...
and
suddenly
peering
at
me
in
the
dim
verandah
,
he
mumbled
*NL*
earnestly
,
``
You
know
--
this
--
no
confounded
nonsense
about
it
--
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
you
how
much
I
owe
to
her
--
and
so
--
you
understand
--
I
--
exactly
as
*NL*
if
...
''
His
hurried
,
anxious
whispers
were
cut
short
by
the
flitting
of
*NL*
a
white
form
within
the
house
,
a
faint
exclamation
,
and
a
child-like
but
*NL*
energetic
little
face
with
delicate
features
and
a
profound
,
attentive
*NL*
glance
peeped
out
of
the
inner
gloom
,
like
a
bird
out
of
the
recess
of
a
*NL*
nest
.
I
was
struck
by
the
name
,
of
course
;
but
it
was
not
till
later
*NL*
on
that
I
connected
it
with
an
astonishing
rumour
that
had
met
me
on
my
*NL*
journey
,
at
a
little
place
on
the
coast
about
230
miles
south
of
Patusan
*NL*
River
.
Stein
's
schooner
,
in
which
I
had
my
passage
,
put
in
there
,
to
*NL*
collect
some
produce
,
and
,
going
ashore
,
I
found
to
my
great
surprise
*NL*
that
the
wretched
locality
could
boast
of
a
third-class
deputy-assistant
*NL*
resident
,
a
big
,
fat
,
greasy
,
blinking
fellow
of
mixed
descent
,
with
*NL*
turned-out
,
shiny
lips
.
I
found
him
lying
extended
on
his
back
in
a
cane
*NL*
chair
,
odiously
unbuttoned
,
with
a
large
green
leaf
of
some
sort
on
the
*NL*
top
of
his
steaming
head
,
and
another
in
his
hand
which
he
used
lazily
*NL*
as
a
fan
...
Going
to
Patusan
?
Oh
yes
.
Stein
's
Trading
Company
.
He
*NL*
knew
.
Had
a
permission
?
No
business
of
his
.
It
was
not
so
bad
there
now
,
*NL*
he
remarked
negligently
,
and
,
he
went
on
drawling
,
``
There
's
some
sort
of
*NL*
white
vagabond
has
got
in
there
,
I
hear
...
Eh
?
What
you
say
?
*NL*
Friend
of
yours
?
So
!
...
Then
it
was
true
there
was
one
of
these
*NL*
verdammte
--
What
was
he
up
to
?
Found
his
way
in
,
the
rascal
.
Eh
?
I
had
*NL*
not
been
sure
.
Patusan
--
they
cut
throats
there
--
no
business
of
ours
.
''
He
*NL*
interrupted
himself
to
groan
.
``
Phoo
!
Almighty
!
The
heat
!
The
heat
!
Well
,
*NL*
then
,
there
might
be
something
in
the
story
too
,
after
all
,
and
...
''
*NL*
He
shut
one
of
his
beastly
glassy
eyes
-LRB-
the
eyelid
went
on
quivering
-RRB-
*NL*
while
he
leered
at
me
atrociously
with
the
other
.
``
Look
here
,
''
says
*NL*
he
mysteriously
,
``
if
--
do
you
understand
?
--
if
he
has
really
got
hold
of
*NL*
something
fairly
good
--
none
of
your
bits
of
green
glass
--
understand
?
--
I
*NL*
am
a
Government
official
--
you
tell
the
rascal
...
Eh
?
What
?
Friend
of
*NL*
yours
?
''
...
He
continued
wallowing
calmly
in
the
chair
...
``
You
said
*NL*
so
;
that
's
just
it
;
and
I
am
pleased
to
give
you
the
hint
.
I
suppose
*NL*
you
too
would
like
to
get
something
out
of
it
?
Do
n't
interrupt
.
You
*NL*
just
tell
him
I
've
heard
the
tale
,
but
to
my
Government
I
have
made
no
*NL*
report
.
Not
yet
.
See
?
Why
make
a
report
?
Eh
?
Tell
him
to
come
to
me
if
*NL*
they
let
him
get
alive
out
of
the
country
.
He
had
better
look
out
*NL*
for
himself
.
Eh
?
I
promise
to
ask
no
questions
.
On
the
quiet
--
you
*NL*
understand
?
You
too
--
you
shall
get
something
from
me
.
Small
commission
*NL*
for
the
trouble
.
Do
n't
interrupt
.
I
am
a
Government
official
,
and
make
*NL*
no
report
.
That
's
business
.
Understand
?
I
know
some
good
people
that
*NL*
will
buy
anything
worth
having
,
and
can
give
him
more
money
than
*NL*
the
scoundrel
ever
saw
in
his
life
.
I
know
his
sort
.
''
He
fixed
me
*NL*
steadfastly
with
both
his
eyes
open
,
while
I
stood
over
him
utterly
*NL*
amazed
,
and
asking
myself
whether
he
was
mad
or
drunk
.
He
perspired
,
*NL*
puffed
,
moaning
feebly
,
and
scratching
himself
with
such
horrible
*NL*
composure
that
I
could
not
bear
the
sight
long
enough
to
find
out
.
Next
*NL*
day
,
talking
casually
with
the
people
of
the
little
native
court
of
the
*NL*
place
,
I
discovered
that
a
story
was
travelling
slowly
down
the
*NL*
coast
about
a
mysterious
white
man
in
Patusan
who
had
got
hold
of
*NL*
an
extraordinary
gem
--
namely
,
an
emerald
of
an
enormous
size
,
and
*NL*
altogether
priceless
.
The
emerald
seems
to
appeal
more
to
the
Eastern
*NL*
imagination
than
any
other
precious
stone
.
The
white
man
had
obtained
*NL*
it
,
I
was
told
,
partly
by
the
exercise
of
his
wonderful
strength
and
*NL*
partly
by
cunning
,
from
the
ruler
of
a
distant
country
,
whence
he
had
*NL*
fled
instantly
,
arriving
in
Patusan
in
utmost
distress
,
but
frightening
*NL*
the
people
by
his
extreme
ferocity
,
which
nothing
seemed
able
to
subdue
.
*NL*
Most
of
my
informants
were
of
the
opinion
that
the
stone
was
probably
*NL*
unlucky
,
--
like
the
famous
stone
of
the
Sultan
of
Succadana
,
which
in
*NL*
the
old
times
had
brought
wars
and
untold
calamities
upon
that
country
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
was
the
same
stone
--
one
could
n't
say
.
Indeed
the
story
of
a
*NL*
fabulously
large
emerald
is
as
old
as
the
arrival
of
the
first
white
men
*NL*
in
the
Archipelago
;
and
the
belief
in
it
is
so
persistent
that
less
than
*NL*
forty
years
ago
there
had
been
an
official
Dutch
inquiry
into
the
truth
*NL*
of
it
.
Such
a
jewel
--
it
was
explained
to
me
by
the
old
fellow
from
whom
*NL*
I
heard
most
of
this
amazing
Jim-myth
--
a
sort
of
scribe
to
the
wretched
*NL*
little
Rajah
of
the
place
;
--
such
a
jewel
,
he
said
,
cocking
his
poor
*NL*
purblind
eyes
up
at
me
-LRB-
he
was
sitting
on
the
cabin
floor
out
of
*NL*
respect
-RRB-
,
is
best
preserved
by
being
concealed
about
the
person
of
a
*NL*
woman
.
Yet
it
is
not
every
woman
that
would
do
.
She
must
be
young
--
he
*NL*
sighed
deeply
--
and
insensible
to
the
seductions
of
love
.
He
shook
his
*NL*
head
sceptically
.
But
such
a
woman
seemed
to
be
actually
in
existence
.
*NL*
He
had
been
told
of
a
tall
girl
,
whom
the
white
man
treated
with
great
*NL*
respect
and
care
,
and
who
never
went
forth
from
the
house
unattended
.
*NL*
People
said
the
white
man
could
be
seen
with
her
almost
any
day
;
they
*NL*
walked
side
by
side
,
openly
,
he
holding
her
arm
under
his
--
pressed
to
*NL*
his
side
--
thus
--
in
a
most
extraordinary
way
.
This
might
be
a
lie
,
he
*NL*
conceded
,
for
it
was
indeed
a
strange
thing
for
any
one
to
do
:
on
the
*NL*
other
hand
,
there
could
be
no
doubt
she
wore
the
white
man
's
jewel
*NL*
concealed
upon
her
bosom
.

CHAPTER
29
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
was
the
theory
of
Jim
's
marital
evening
walks
.
I
made
a
third
on
*NL*
more
than
one
occasion
,
unpleasantly
aware
every
time
of
Cornelius
,
*NL*
who
nursed
the
aggrieved
sense
of
his
legal
paternity
,
slinking
in
*NL*
the
neighbourhood
with
that
peculiar
twist
of
his
mouth
as
if
he
were
*NL*
perpetually
on
the
point
of
gnashing
his
teeth
.
But
do
you
notice
how
,
*NL*
three
hundred
miles
beyond
the
end
of
telegraph
cables
and
mail-boat
*NL*
lines
,
the
haggard
utilitarian
lies
of
our
civilisation
wither
and
die
,
*NL*
to
be
replaced
by
pure
exercises
of
imagination
,
that
have
the
futility
,
*NL*
often
the
charm
,
and
sometimes
the
deep
hidden
truthfulness
,
of
works
of
*NL*
art
?
Romance
had
singled
Jim
for
its
own
--
and
that
was
the
true
part
of
*NL*
the
story
,
which
otherwise
was
all
wrong
.
He
did
not
hide
his
jewel
.
In
*NL*
fact
,
he
was
extremely
proud
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
comes
to
me
now
that
I
had
,
on
the
whole
,
seen
very
little
of
her
.
*NL*
What
I
remember
best
is
the
even
,
olive
pallor
of
her
complexion
,
and
*NL*
the
intense
blue-black
gleams
of
her
hair
,
flowing
abundantly
from
under
*NL*
a
small
crimson
cap
she
wore
far
back
on
her
shapely
head
.
Her
movements
*NL*
were
free
,
assured
,
and
she
blushed
a
dusky
red
.
While
Jim
and
I
were
*NL*
talking
,
she
would
come
and
go
with
rapid
glances
at
us
,
leaving
on
her
*NL*
passage
an
impression
of
grace
and
charm
and
a
distinct
suggestion
of
*NL*
watchfulness
.
Her
manner
presented
a
curious
combination
of
shyness
and
*NL*
audacity
.
Every
pretty
smile
was
succeeded
swiftly
by
a
look
of
silent
,
*NL*
repressed
anxiety
,
as
if
put
to
flight
by
the
recollection
of
some
*NL*
abiding
danger
.
At
times
she
would
sit
down
with
us
and
,
with
her
soft
*NL*
cheek
dimpled
by
the
knuckles
of
her
little
hand
,
she
would
listen
*NL*
to
our
talk
;
her
big
clear
eyes
would
remain
fastened
on
our
lips
,
as
*NL*
though
each
pronounced
word
had
a
visible
shape
.
Her
mother
had
taught
*NL*
her
to
read
and
write
;
she
had
learned
a
good
bit
of
English
from
*NL*
Jim
,
and
she
spoke
it
most
amusingly
,
with
his
own
clipping
,
boyish
*NL*
intonation
.
Her
tenderness
hovered
over
him
like
a
flutter
of
wings
.
She
*NL*
lived
so
completely
in
his
contemplation
that
she
had
acquired
something
*NL*
of
his
outward
aspect
,
something
that
recalled
him
in
her
movements
,
in
*NL*
the
way
she
stretched
her
arm
,
turned
her
head
,
directed
her
glances
.
*NL*
Her
vigilant
affection
had
an
intensity
that
made
it
almost
perceptible
*NL*
to
the
senses
;
it
seemed
actually
to
exist
in
the
ambient
matter
*NL*
of
space
,
to
envelop
him
like
a
peculiar
fragrance
,
to
dwell
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
like
a
tremulous
,
subdued
,
and
impassioned
note
.
I
suppose
you
*NL*
think
that
I
too
am
romantic
,
but
it
is
a
mistake
.
I
am
relating
to
you
*NL*
the
sober
impressions
of
a
bit
of
youth
,
of
a
strange
uneasy
romance
*NL*
that
had
come
in
my
way
.
I
observed
with
interest
the
work
of
*NL*
his
--
well
--
good
fortune
.
He
was
jealously
loved
,
but
why
she
should
*NL*
be
jealous
,
and
of
what
,
I
could
not
tell
.
The
land
,
the
people
,
the
*NL*
forests
were
her
accomplices
,
guarding
him
with
vigilant
accord
,
with
*NL*
an
air
of
seclusion
,
of
mystery
,
of
invincible
possession
.
There
was
*NL*
no
appeal
,
as
it
were
;
he
was
imprisoned
within
the
very
freedom
of
his
*NL*
power
,
and
she
,
though
ready
to
make
a
footstool
of
her
head
for
his
*NL*
feet
,
guarded
her
conquest
inflexibly
--
as
though
he
were
hard
to
keep
.
*NL*
The
very
Tamb
'
Itam
,
marching
on
our
journeys
upon
the
heels
of
his
*NL*
white
lord
,
with
his
head
thrown
back
,
truculent
and
be-weaponed
like
a
*NL*
janissary
,
with
kriss
,
chopper
,
and
lance
-LRB-
besides
carrying
Jim
's
gun
-RRB-
;
*NL*
even
Tamb
'
Itam
allowed
himself
to
put
on
the
airs
of
uncompromising
*NL*
guardianship
,
like
a
surly
devoted
jailer
ready
to
lay
down
his
life
for
*NL*
his
captive
.
On
the
evenings
when
we
sat
up
late
,
his
silent
,
indistinct
*NL*
form
would
pass
and
repass
under
the
verandah
,
with
noiseless
footsteps
,
*NL*
or
lifting
my
head
I
would
unexpectedly
make
him
out
standing
rigidly
*NL*
erect
in
the
shadow
.
As
a
general
rule
he
would
vanish
after
a
time
,
*NL*
without
a
sound
;
but
when
we
rose
he
would
spring
up
close
to
us
as
if
*NL*
from
the
ground
,
ready
for
any
orders
Jim
might
wish
to
give
.
The
girl
*NL*
too
,
I
believe
,
never
went
to
sleep
till
we
had
separated
for
the
night
.
*NL*
More
than
once
I
saw
her
and
Jim
through
the
window
of
my
room
come
out
*NL*
together
quietly
and
lean
on
the
rough
balustrade
--
two
white
forms
very
*NL*
close
,
his
arm
about
her
waist
,
her
head
on
his
shoulder
.
Their
soft
*NL*
murmurs
reached
me
,
penetrating
,
tender
,
with
a
calm
sad
note
in
the
*NL*
stillness
of
the
night
,
like
a
self-communion
of
one
being
carried
on
*NL*
in
two
tones
.
Later
on
,
tossing
on
my
bed
under
the
mosquito-net
,
I
*NL*
was
sure
to
hear
slight
creakings
,
faint
breathing
,
a
throat
cleared
*NL*
cautiously
--
and
I
would
know
that
Tamb
'
Itam
was
still
on
the
prowl
.
*NL*
Though
he
had
-LRB-
by
the
favour
of
the
white
lord
-RRB-
a
house
in
the
compound
,
*NL*
had
``
taken
wife
,
''
and
had
lately
been
blessed
with
a
child
,
I
believe
*NL*
that
,
during
my
stay
at
all
events
,
he
slept
on
the
verandah
every
*NL*
night
.
It
was
very
difficult
to
make
this
faithful
and
grim
retainer
*NL*
talk
.
Even
Jim
himself
was
answered
in
jerky
short
sentences
,
under
*NL*
protest
as
it
were
.
Talking
,
he
seemed
to
imply
,
was
no
business
of
his
.
*NL*
The
longest
speech
I
heard
him
volunteer
was
one
morning
when
,
suddenly
*NL*
extending
his
hand
towards
the
courtyard
,
he
pointed
at
Cornelius
and
*NL*
said
,
``
Here
comes
the
Nazarene
.
''
I
do
n't
think
he
was
addressing
me
,
*NL*
though
I
stood
at
his
side
;
his
object
seemed
rather
to
awaken
the
*NL*
indignant
attention
of
the
universe
.
Some
muttered
allusions
,
which
*NL*
followed
,
to
dogs
and
the
smell
of
roast-meat
,
struck
me
as
singularly
*NL*
felicitous
.
The
courtyard
,
a
large
square
space
,
was
one
torrid
blaze
of
*NL*
sunshine
,
and
,
bathed
in
intense
light
,
Cornelius
was
creeping
across
*NL*
in
full
view
with
an
inexpressible
effect
of
stealthiness
,
of
dark
and
*NL*
secret
slinking
.
He
reminded
one
of
everything
that
is
unsavoury
.
His
*NL*
slow
laborious
walk
resembled
the
creeping
of
a
repulsive
beetle
,
the
*NL*
legs
alone
moving
with
horrid
industry
while
the
body
glided
evenly
.
I
*NL*
suppose
he
made
straight
enough
for
the
place
where
he
wanted
to
get
to
,
*NL*
but
his
progress
with
one
shoulder
carried
forward
seemed
oblique
.
He
*NL*
was
often
seen
circling
slowly
amongst
the
sheds
,
as
if
following
*NL*
a
scent
;
passing
before
the
verandah
with
upward
stealthy
glances
;
*NL*
disappearing
without
haste
round
the
corner
of
some
hut
.
That
he
seemed
*NL*
free
of
the
place
demonstrated
Jim
's
absurd
carelessness
or
else
his
*NL*
infinite
disdain
,
for
Cornelius
had
played
a
very
dubious
part
-LRB-
to
say
*NL*
the
least
of
it
-RRB-
in
a
certain
episode
which
might
have
ended
fatally
for
*NL*
Jim
.
As
a
matter
of
fact
,
it
had
redounded
to
his
glory
.
But
everything
*NL*
redounded
to
his
glory
;
and
it
was
the
irony
of
his
good
fortune
that
*NL*
he
,
who
had
been
too
careful
of
it
once
,
seemed
to
bear
a
charmed
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
must
know
he
had
left
Doramin
's
place
very
soon
after
his
*NL*
arrival
--
much
too
soon
,
in
fact
,
for
his
safety
,
and
of
course
a
long
*NL*
time
before
the
war
.
In
this
he
was
actuated
by
a
sense
of
duty
;
he
had
*NL*
to
look
after
Stein
's
business
,
he
said
.
Had
n't
he
?
To
that
end
,
with
an
*NL*
utter
disregard
of
his
personal
safety
,
he
crossed
the
river
and
took
up
*NL*
his
quarters
with
Cornelius
.
How
the
latter
had
managed
to
exist
through
*NL*
the
troubled
times
I
ca
n't
say
.
As
Stein
's
agent
,
after
all
,
he
must
*NL*
have
had
Doramin
's
protection
in
a
measure
;
and
in
one
way
or
another
*NL*
he
had
managed
to
wriggle
through
all
the
deadly
complications
,
while
I
*NL*
have
no
doubt
that
his
conduct
,
whatever
line
he
was
forced
to
take
,
was
*NL*
marked
by
that
abjectness
which
was
like
the
stamp
of
the
man
.
That
was
*NL*
his
characteristic
;
he
was
fundamentally
and
outwardly
abject
,
as
other
*NL*
men
are
markedly
of
a
generous
,
distinguished
,
or
venerable
appearance
.
*NL*
It
was
the
element
of
his
nature
which
permeated
all
his
acts
and
*NL*
passions
and
emotions
;
he
raged
abjectly
,
smiled
abjectly
,
was
abjectly
*NL*
sad
;
his
civilities
and
his
indignations
were
alike
abject
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
his
love
would
have
been
the
most
abject
of
sentiments
--
but
can
one
*NL*
imagine
a
loathsome
insect
in
love
?
And
his
loathsomeness
,
too
,
was
*NL*
abject
,
so
that
a
simply
disgusting
person
would
have
appeared
noble
*NL*
by
his
side
.
He
has
his
place
neither
in
the
background
nor
in
the
*NL*
foreground
of
the
story
;
he
is
simply
seen
skulking
on
its
outskirts
,
*NL*
enigmatical
and
unclean
,
tainting
the
fragrance
of
its
youth
and
of
its
*NL*
naiveness
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
position
in
any
case
could
not
have
been
other
than
extremely
*NL*
miserable
,
yet
it
may
very
well
be
that
he
found
some
advantages
in
it
.
*NL*
Jim
told
me
he
had
been
received
at
first
with
an
abject
display
of
*NL*
the
most
amicable
sentiments
.
``
The
fellow
apparently
could
n't
contain
*NL*
himself
for
joy
,
''
said
Jim
with
disgust
.
``
He
flew
at
me
every
morning
to
*NL*
shake
both
my
hands
--
confound
him
!
--
but
I
could
never
tell
whether
there
*NL*
would
be
any
breakfast
.
If
I
got
three
meals
in
two
days
I
considered
*NL*
myself
jolly
lucky
,
and
he
made
me
sign
a
chit
for
ten
dollars
every
*NL*
week
.
Said
he
was
sure
Mr.
Stein
did
not
mean
him
to
keep
me
for
*NL*
nothing
.
Well
--
he
kept
me
on
nothing
as
near
as
possible
.
Put
it
down
to
*NL*
the
unsettled
state
of
the
country
,
and
made
as
if
to
tear
his
hair
out
,
*NL*
begging
my
pardon
twenty
times
a
day
,
so
that
I
had
at
last
to
entreat
*NL*
him
not
to
worry
.
It
made
me
sick
.
Half
the
roof
of
his
house
had
*NL*
fallen
in
,
and
the
whole
place
had
a
mangy
look
,
with
wisps
of
dry
grass
*NL*
sticking
out
and
the
corners
of
broken
mats
flapping
on
every
wall
.
He
*NL*
did
his
best
to
make
out
that
Mr.
Stein
owed
him
money
on
the
last
three
*NL*
years
'
trading
,
but
his
books
were
all
torn
,
and
some
were
missing
.
He
*NL*
tried
to
hint
it
was
his
late
wife
's
fault
.
Disgusting
scoundrel
!
At
*NL*
last
I
had
to
forbid
him
to
mention
his
late
wife
at
all
.
It
made
Jewel
*NL*
cry
.
I
could
n't
discover
what
became
of
all
the
trade-goods
;
there
was
*NL*
nothing
in
the
store
but
rats
,
having
a
high
old
time
amongst
a
litter
*NL*
of
brown
paper
and
old
sacking
.
I
was
assured
on
every
hand
that
he
had
*NL*
a
lot
of
money
buried
somewhere
,
but
of
course
could
get
nothing
out
of
*NL*
him
.
It
was
the
most
miserable
existence
I
led
there
in
that
wretched
*NL*
house
.
I
tried
to
do
my
duty
by
Stein
,
but
I
had
also
other
matters
to
*NL*
think
of
.
When
I
escaped
to
Doramin
old
Tunku
Allang
got
frightened
and
*NL*
returned
all
my
things
.
It
was
done
in
a
roundabout
way
,
and
with
no
end
*NL*
of
mystery
,
through
a
Chinaman
who
keeps
a
small
shop
here
;
but
as
soon
*NL*
as
I
left
the
Bugis
quarter
and
went
to
live
with
Cornelius
it
began
*NL*
to
be
said
openly
that
the
Rajah
had
made
up
his
mind
to
have
me
killed
*NL*
before
long
.
Pleasant
,
was
n't
it
?
And
I
could
n't
see
what
there
was
to
*NL*
prevent
him
if
he
really
_
had
_
made
up
his
mind
.
The
worst
of
it
was
,
*NL*
I
could
n't
help
feeling
I
was
n't
doing
any
good
either
for
Stein
or
for
*NL*
myself
.
Oh
!
it
was
beastly
--
the
whole
six
weeks
of
it
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
told
me
further
that
he
did
n't
know
what
made
him
hang
on
--
but
of
*NL*
course
we
may
guess
.
He
sympathised
deeply
with
the
defenceless
girl
,
at
*NL*
the
mercy
of
that
``
mean
,
cowardly
scoundrel
.
''
It
appears
Cornelius
led
*NL*
her
an
awful
life
,
stopping
only
short
of
actual
ill-usage
,
for
which
*NL*
he
had
not
the
pluck
,
I
suppose
.
He
insisted
upon
her
calling
him
*NL*
father
--
``
and
with
respect
,
too
--
with
respect
,
''
he
would
scream
,
shaking
*NL*
a
little
yellow
fist
in
her
face
.
``
I
am
a
respectable
man
,
and
what
are
*NL*
you
?
Tell
me
--
what
are
you
?
You
think
I
am
going
to
bring
up
somebody
*NL*
else
's
child
and
not
be
treated
with
respect
?
You
ought
to
be
glad
I
let
*NL*
you
.
Come
--
say
Yes
,
father
...
No
?
...
You
wait
a
bit
.
''
Thereupon
*NL*
he
would
begin
to
abuse
the
dead
woman
,
till
the
girl
would
run
off
with
*NL*
her
hands
to
her
head
.
He
pursued
her
,
dashing
in
and
out
and
round
the
*NL*
house
and
amongst
the
sheds
,
would
drive
her
into
some
corner
,
where
she
*NL*
would
fall
on
her
knees
stopping
her
ears
,
and
then
he
would
stand
at
a
*NL*
distance
and
declaim
filthy
denunciations
at
her
back
for
half
an
hour
*NL*
at
a
stretch
.
``
Your
mother
was
a
devil
,
a
deceitful
devil
--
and
you
too
*NL*
are
a
devil
,
''
he
would
shriek
in
a
final
outburst
,
pick
up
a
bit
of
dry
*NL*
earth
or
a
handful
of
mud
-LRB-
there
was
plenty
of
mud
around
the
house
-RRB-
,
*NL*
and
fling
it
into
her
hair
.
Sometimes
,
though
,
she
would
hold
out
full
*NL*
of
scorn
,
confronting
him
in
silence
,
her
face
sombre
and
contracted
,
*NL*
and
only
now
and
then
uttering
a
word
or
two
that
would
make
the
other
*NL*
jump
and
writhe
with
the
sting
.
Jim
told
me
these
scenes
were
terrible
.
*NL*
It
was
indeed
a
strange
thing
to
come
upon
in
a
wilderness
.
The
*NL*
endlessness
of
such
a
subtly
cruel
situation
was
appalling
--
if
you
think
*NL*
of
it
.
The
respectable
Cornelius
-LRB-
Inchi
`
Nelyus
the
Malays
called
him
,
*NL*
with
a
grimace
that
meant
many
things
-RRB-
was
a
much-disappointed
man
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
he
had
expected
would
be
done
for
him
in
consideration
*NL*
of
his
marriage
;
but
evidently
the
liberty
to
steal
,
and
embezzle
,
and
*NL*
appropriate
to
himself
for
many
years
and
in
any
way
that
suited
him
*NL*
best
,
the
goods
of
Stein
's
Trading
Company
-LRB-
Stein
kept
the
supply
up
*NL*
unfalteringly
as
long
as
he
could
get
his
skippers
to
take
it
there
-RRB-
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
him
a
fair
equivalent
for
the
sacrifice
of
his
honourable
*NL*
name
.
Jim
would
have
enjoyed
exceedingly
thrashing
Cornelius
within
an
*NL*
inch
of
his
life
;
on
the
other
hand
,
the
scenes
were
of
so
painful
*NL*
a
character
,
so
abominable
,
that
his
impulse
would
be
to
get
out
of
*NL*
earshot
,
in
order
to
spare
the
girl
's
feelings
.
They
left
her
agitated
,
*NL*
speechless
,
clutching
her
bosom
now
and
then
with
a
stony
,
*NL*
desperate
face
,
and
then
Jim
would
lounge
up
and
say
unhappily
,
*NL*
``
Now
--
come
--
really
--
what
's
the
use
--
you
must
try
to
eat
a
bit
,
''
or
give
*NL*
some
such
mark
of
sympathy
.
Cornelius
would
keep
on
slinking
through
*NL*
the
doorways
,
across
the
verandah
and
back
again
,
as
mute
as
a
fish
,
and
*NL*
with
malevolent
,
mistrustful
,
underhand
glances
.
``
I
can
stop
his
game
,
''
*NL*
Jim
said
to
her
once
.
``
Just
say
the
word
.
''
And
do
you
know
what
she
*NL*
answered
?
She
said
--
Jim
told
me
impressively
--
that
if
she
had
not
been
*NL*
sure
he
was
intensely
wretched
himself
,
she
would
have
found
the
courage
*NL*
to
kill
him
with
her
own
hands
.
``
Just
fancy
that
!
The
poor
devil
of
a
*NL*
girl
,
almost
a
child
,
being
driven
to
talk
like
that
,
''
he
exclaimed
in
*NL*
horror
.
It
seemed
impossible
to
save
her
not
only
from
that
mean
*NL*
rascal
but
even
from
herself
!
It
was
n't
that
he
pitied
her
so
much
,
he
*NL*
affirmed
;
it
was
more
than
pity
;
it
was
as
if
he
had
something
on
his
*NL*
conscience
,
while
that
life
went
on
.
To
leave
the
house
would
have
*NL*
appeared
a
base
desertion
.
He
had
understood
at
last
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
expect
from
a
longer
stay
,
neither
accounts
nor
money
,
nor
*NL*
truth
of
any
sort
,
but
he
stayed
on
,
exasperating
Cornelius
to
the
*NL*
verge
,
I
wo
n't
say
of
insanity
,
but
almost
of
courage
.
Meantime
he
felt
*NL*
all
sorts
of
dangers
gathering
obscurely
about
him
.
Doramin
had
sent
*NL*
over
twice
a
trusty
servant
to
tell
him
seriously
that
he
could
do
*NL*
nothing
for
his
safety
unless
he
would
recross
the
river
again
and
live
*NL*
amongst
the
Bugis
as
at
first
.
People
of
every
condition
used
to
call
,
*NL*
often
in
the
dead
of
night
,
in
order
to
disclose
to
him
plots
for
*NL*
his
assassination
.
He
was
to
be
poisoned
.
He
was
to
be
stabbed
in
the
*NL*
bath-house
.
Arrangements
were
being
made
to
have
him
shot
from
a
boat
*NL*
on
the
river
.
Each
of
these
informants
professed
himself
to
be
his
very
*NL*
good
friend
.
It
was
enough
--
he
told
me
--
to
spoil
a
fellow
's
rest
for
*NL*
ever
.
Something
of
the
kind
was
extremely
possible
--
nay
,
probable
--
but
*NL*
the
lying
warnings
gave
him
only
the
sense
of
deadly
scheming
going
on
*NL*
all
around
him
,
on
all
sides
,
in
the
dark
.
Nothing
more
calculated
to
*NL*
shake
the
best
of
nerve
.
Finally
,
one
night
,
Cornelius
himself
,
with
a
*NL*
great
apparatus
of
alarm
and
secrecy
,
unfolded
in
solemn
wheedling
tones
*NL*
a
little
plan
wherein
for
one
hundred
dollars
--
or
even
for
eighty
;
let
's
*NL*
say
eighty
--
he
,
Cornelius
,
would
procure
a
trustworthy
man
to
smuggle
*NL*
Jim
out
of
the
river
,
all
safe
.
There
was
nothing
else
for
it
now
--
if
*NL*
Jim
cared
a
pin
for
his
life
.
What
's
eighty
dollars
?
A
trifle
.
An
*NL*
insignificant
sum
.
While
he
,
Cornelius
,
who
had
to
remain
behind
,
was
*NL*
absolutely
courting
death
by
this
proof
of
devotion
to
Mr.
Stein
's
young
*NL*
friend
.
The
sight
of
his
abject
grimacing
was
--
Jim
told
me
--
very
hard
*NL*
to
bear
:
he
clutched
at
his
hair
,
beat
his
breast
,
rocked
himself
to
*NL*
and
fro
with
his
hands
pressed
to
his
stomach
,
and
actually
pretended
to
*NL*
shed
tears
.
``
Your
blood
be
on
your
own
head
,
''
he
squeaked
at
last
,
and
*NL*
rushed
out
.
It
is
a
curious
question
how
far
Cornelius
was
sincere
in
*NL*
that
performance
.
Jim
confessed
to
me
that
he
did
not
sleep
a
wink
after
*NL*
the
fellow
had
gone
.
He
lay
on
his
back
on
a
thin
mat
spread
over
the
*NL*
bamboo
flooring
,
trying
idly
to
make
out
the
bare
rafters
,
and
listening
*NL*
to
the
rustlings
in
the
torn
thatch
.
A
star
suddenly
twinkled
through
a
*NL*
hole
in
the
roof
.
His
brain
was
in
a
whirl
;
but
,
nevertheless
,
it
was
on
*NL*
that
very
night
that
he
matured
his
plan
for
overcoming
Sherif
Ali
.
It
*NL*
had
been
the
thought
of
all
the
moments
he
could
spare
from
the
hopeless
*NL*
investigation
into
Stein
's
affairs
,
but
the
notion
--
he
says
--
came
to
him
*NL*
then
all
at
once
.
He
could
see
,
as
it
were
,
the
guns
mounted
on
the
top
*NL*
of
the
hill
.
He
got
very
hot
and
excited
lying
there
;
sleep
was
out
of
*NL*
the
question
more
than
ever
.
He
jumped
up
,
and
went
out
barefooted
*NL*
on
the
verandah
.
Walking
silently
,
he
came
upon
the
girl
,
motionless
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
as
if
on
the
watch
.
In
his
then
state
of
mind
it
did
*NL*
not
surprise
him
to
see
her
up
,
nor
yet
to
hear
her
ask
in
an
anxious
*NL*
whisper
where
Cornelius
could
be
.
He
simply
said
he
did
not
know
.
She
*NL*
moaned
a
little
,
and
peered
into
the
campong
.
Everything
was
very
quiet
.
*NL*
He
was
possessed
by
his
new
idea
,
and
so
full
of
it
that
he
could
not
*NL*
help
telling
the
girl
all
about
it
at
once
.
She
listened
,
clapped
her
*NL*
hands
lightly
,
whispered
softly
her
admiration
,
but
was
evidently
on
the
*NL*
alert
all
the
time
.
It
seems
he
had
been
used
to
make
a
confidant
of
*NL*
her
all
along
--
and
that
she
on
her
part
could
and
did
give
him
a
lot
of
*NL*
useful
hints
as
to
Patusan
affairs
there
is
no
doubt
.
He
assured
me
more
*NL*
than
once
that
he
had
never
found
himself
the
worse
for
her
advice
.
At
*NL*
any
rate
,
he
was
proceeding
to
explain
his
plan
fully
to
her
there
and
*NL*
then
,
when
she
pressed
his
arm
once
,
and
vanished
from
his
side
.
Then
*NL*
Cornelius
appeared
from
somewhere
,
and
,
perceiving
Jim
,
ducked
sideways
,
*NL*
as
though
he
had
been
shot
at
,
and
afterwards
stood
very
still
in
the
*NL*
dusk
.
At
last
he
came
forward
prudently
,
like
a
suspicious
cat
.
``
There
*NL*
were
some
fishermen
there
--
with
fish
,
''
he
said
in
a
shaky
voice
.
``
To
*NL*
sell
fish
--
you
understand
.
''
...
It
must
have
been
then
two
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
morning
--
a
likely
time
for
anybody
to
hawk
fish
about
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
,
however
,
let
the
statement
pass
,
and
did
not
give
it
a
single
*NL*
thought
.
Other
matters
occupied
his
mind
,
and
besides
he
had
neither
*NL*
seen
nor
heard
anything
.
He
contented
himself
by
saying
,
``
Oh
!
''
absently
,
*NL*
got
a
drink
of
water
out
of
a
pitcher
standing
there
,
and
leaving
*NL*
Cornelius
a
prey
to
some
inexplicable
emotion
--
that
made
him
embrace
*NL*
with
both
arms
the
worm-eaten
rail
of
the
verandah
as
if
his
legs
had
*NL*
failed
--
went
in
again
and
lay
down
on
his
mat
to
think
.
By-and-by
he
*NL*
heard
stealthy
footsteps
.
They
stopped
.
A
voice
whispered
tremulously
*NL*
through
the
wall
,
``
Are
you
asleep
?
''
``
No
!
What
is
it
?
''
he
answered
*NL*
briskly
,
and
there
was
an
abrupt
movement
outside
,
and
then
all
was
*NL*
still
,
as
if
the
whisperer
had
been
startled
.
Extremely
annoyed
at
this
,
*NL*
Jim
came
out
impetuously
,
and
Cornelius
with
a
faint
shriek
fled
*NL*
along
the
verandah
as
far
as
the
steps
,
where
he
hung
on
to
the
broken
*NL*
banister
.
Very
puzzled
,
Jim
called
out
to
him
from
the
distance
to
know
*NL*
what
the
devil
he
meant
.
``
Have
you
given
your
consideration
to
what
*NL*
I
spoke
to
you
about
?
''
asked
Cornelius
,
pronouncing
the
words
with
*NL*
difficulty
,
like
a
man
in
the
cold
fit
of
a
fever
.
``
No
!
''
shouted
Jim
in
*NL*
a
passion
.
``
I
have
not
,
and
I
do
n't
intend
to
.
I
am
going
to
live
here
,
*NL*
in
Patusan
.
''
``
You
shall
d-d-die
h-h-here
,
''
answered
Cornelius
,
*NL*
still
shaking
violently
,
and
in
a
sort
of
expiring
voice
.
The
whole
*NL*
performance
was
so
absurd
and
provoking
that
Jim
did
n't
know
whether
he
*NL*
ought
to
be
amused
or
angry
.
``
Not
till
I
have
seen
you
tucked
away
,
*NL*
you
bet
,
''
he
called
out
,
exasperated
yet
ready
to
laugh
.
Half
seriously
*NL*
-LRB-
being
excited
with
his
own
thoughts
,
you
know
-RRB-
he
went
on
shouting
,
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
touch
me
!
You
can
do
your
damnedest
.
''
Somehow
the
shadowy
*NL*
Cornelius
far
off
there
seemed
to
be
the
hateful
embodiment
of
all
the
*NL*
annoyances
and
difficulties
he
had
found
in
his
path
.
He
let
himself
*NL*
go
--
his
nerves
had
been
over-wrought
for
days
--
and
called
him
many
*NL*
pretty
names
,
--
swindler
,
liar
,
sorry
rascal
:
in
fact
,
carried
on
in
an
*NL*
extraordinary
way
.
He
admits
he
passed
all
bounds
,
that
he
was
quite
*NL*
beside
himself
--
defied
all
Patusan
to
scare
him
away
--
declared
he
would
*NL*
make
them
all
dance
to
his
own
tune
yet
,
and
so
on
,
in
a
menacing
,
*NL*
boasting
strain
.
Perfectly
bombastic
and
ridiculous
,
he
said
.
His
ears
*NL*
burned
at
the
bare
recollection
.
Must
have
been
off
his
chump
in
some
*NL*
way
...
The
girl
,
who
was
sitting
with
us
,
nodded
her
little
head
at
*NL*
me
quickly
,
frowned
faintly
,
and
said
,
``
I
heard
him
,
''
with
child-like
*NL*
solemnity
.
He
laughed
and
blushed
.
What
stopped
him
at
last
,
he
said
,
*NL*
was
the
silence
,
the
complete
deathlike
silence
,
of
the
indistinct
*NL*
figure
far
over
there
,
that
seemed
to
hang
collapsed
,
doubled
over
the
*NL*
rail
in
a
weird
immobility
.
He
came
to
his
senses
,
and
ceasing
suddenly
,
*NL*
wondered
greatly
at
himself
.
He
watched
for
a
while
.
Not
a
stir
,
not
a
*NL*
sound
.
``
Exactly
as
if
the
chap
had
died
while
I
had
been
making
all
that
*NL*
noise
,
''
he
said
.
He
was
so
ashamed
of
himself
that
he
went
indoors
in
a
*NL*
hurry
without
another
word
,
and
flung
himself
down
again
.
The
row
seemed
*NL*
to
have
done
him
good
though
,
because
he
went
to
sleep
for
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
night
like
a
baby
.
Had
n't
slept
like
that
for
weeks
.
``
But
_
I
_
did
n't
*NL*
sleep
,
''
struck
in
the
girl
,
one
elbow
on
the
table
and
nursing
her
*NL*
cheek
.
``
I
watched
.
''
Her
big
eyes
flashed
,
rolling
a
little
,
and
then
she
*NL*
fixed
them
on
my
face
intently
.

CHAPTER
31
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
may
imagine
with
what
interest
I
listened
.
All
these
details
were
*NL*
perceived
to
have
some
significance
twenty-four
hours
later
.
In
the
*NL*
morning
Cornelius
made
no
allusion
to
the
events
of
the
night
.
``
I
*NL*
suppose
you
will
come
back
to
my
poor
house
,
''
he
muttered
,
surlily
,
*NL*
slinking
up
just
as
Jim
was
entering
the
canoe
to
go
over
to
Doramin
's
*NL*
campong
.
Jim
only
nodded
,
without
looking
at
him
.
``
You
find
it
good
fun
,
*NL*
no
doubt
,
''
muttered
the
other
in
a
sour
tone
.
Jim
spent
the
day
with
the
*NL*
old
nakhoda
,
preaching
the
necessity
of
vigorous
action
to
the
principal
*NL*
men
of
the
Bugis
community
,
who
had
been
summoned
for
a
big
talk
.
He
*NL*
remembered
with
pleasure
how
very
eloquent
and
persuasive
he
had
been
.
*NL*
``
I
managed
to
put
some
backbone
into
them
that
time
,
and
no
mistake
,
''
he
*NL*
said
.
Sherif
Ali
's
last
raid
had
swept
the
outskirts
of
the
settlement
,
*NL*
and
some
women
belonging
to
the
town
had
been
carried
off
to
the
*NL*
stockade
.
Sherif
Ali
's
emissaries
had
been
seen
in
the
market-place
the
*NL*
day
before
,
strutting
about
haughtily
in
white
cloaks
,
and
boasting
of
*NL*
the
Rajah
's
friendship
for
their
master
.
One
of
them
stood
forward
*NL*
in
the
shade
of
a
tree
,
and
,
leaning
on
the
long
barrel
of
a
rifle
,
*NL*
exhorted
the
people
to
prayer
and
repentance
,
advising
them
to
kill
all
*NL*
the
strangers
in
their
midst
,
some
of
whom
,
he
said
,
were
infidels
and
*NL*
others
even
worse
--
children
of
Satan
in
the
guise
of
Moslems
.
It
was
*NL*
reported
that
several
of
the
Rajah
's
people
amongst
the
listeners
had
*NL*
loudly
expressed
their
approbation
.
The
terror
amongst
the
common
people
*NL*
was
intense
.
Jim
,
immensely
pleased
with
his
day
's
work
,
crossed
the
*NL*
river
again
before
sunset
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
he
had
got
the
Bugis
irretrievably
committed
to
action
and
had
made
*NL*
himself
responsible
for
success
on
his
own
head
,
he
was
so
elated
that
*NL*
in
the
lightness
of
his
heart
he
absolutely
tried
to
be
civil
with
*NL*
Cornelius
.
But
Cornelius
became
wildly
jovial
in
response
,
and
it
was
*NL*
almost
more
than
he
could
stand
,
he
says
,
to
hear
his
little
squeaks
of
*NL*
false
laughter
,
to
see
him
wriggle
and
blink
,
and
suddenly
catch
hold
of
*NL*
his
chin
and
crouch
low
over
the
table
with
a
distracted
stare
.
The
*NL*
girl
did
not
show
herself
,
and
Jim
retired
early
.
When
he
rose
to
say
*NL*
good-night
,
Cornelius
jumped
up
,
knocking
his
chair
over
,
and
ducked
out
*NL*
of
sight
as
if
to
pick
up
something
he
had
dropped
.
His
good-night
came
*NL*
huskily
from
under
the
table
.
Jim
was
amazed
to
see
him
emerge
with
a
*NL*
dropping
jaw
,
and
staring
,
stupidly
frightened
eyes
.
He
clutched
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
table
.
``
What
's
the
matter
?
Are
you
unwell
?
''
asked
Jim
.
``
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
,
yes
.
A
great
colic
in
my
stomach
,
''
says
the
other
;
and
it
is
*NL*
Jim
's
opinion
that
it
was
perfectly
true
.
If
so
,
it
was
,
in
view
of
his
*NL*
contemplated
action
,
an
abject
sign
of
a
still
imperfect
callousness
for
*NL*
which
he
must
be
given
all
due
credit
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Be
it
as
it
may
,
Jim
's
slumbers
were
disturbed
by
a
dream
of
heavens
*NL*
like
brass
resounding
with
a
great
voice
,
which
called
upon
him
to
*NL*
Awake
!
Awake
!
so
loud
that
,
notwithstanding
his
desperate
determination
*NL*
to
sleep
on
,
he
did
wake
up
in
reality
.
The
glare
of
a
red
spluttering
*NL*
conflagration
going
on
in
mid-air
fell
on
his
eyes
.
Coils
of
black
thick
*NL*
smoke
curved
round
the
head
of
some
apparition
,
some
unearthly
being
,
*NL*
all
in
white
,
with
a
severe
,
drawn
,
anxious
face
.
After
a
second
or
so
*NL*
he
recognised
the
girl
.
She
was
holding
a
dammar
torch
at
arm
's
-
length
*NL*
aloft
,
and
in
a
persistent
,
urgent
monotone
she
was
repeating
,
``
Get
up
!
*NL*
Get
up
!
Get
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suddenly
he
leaped
to
his
feet
;
at
once
she
put
into
his
hand
a
*NL*
revolver
,
his
own
revolver
,
which
had
been
hanging
on
a
nail
,
but
loaded
*NL*
this
time
.
He
gripped
it
in
silence
,
bewildered
,
blinking
in
the
light
.
*NL*
He
wondered
what
he
could
do
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
asked
rapidly
and
very
low
,
``
Can
you
face
four
men
with
this
?
''
*NL*
He
laughed
while
narrating
this
part
at
the
recollection
of
his
polite
*NL*
alacrity
.
It
seems
he
made
a
great
display
of
it
.
``
Certainly
--
of
*NL*
course
--
certainly
--
command
me
.
''
He
was
not
properly
awake
,
and
had
a
*NL*
notion
of
being
very
civil
in
these
extraordinary
circumstances
,
of
*NL*
showing
his
unquestioning
,
devoted
readiness
.
She
left
the
room
,
and
*NL*
he
followed
her
;
in
the
passage
they
disturbed
an
old
hag
who
did
the
*NL*
casual
cooking
of
the
household
,
though
she
was
so
decrepit
as
to
be
*NL*
hardly
able
to
understand
human
speech
.
She
got
up
and
hobbled
behind
*NL*
them
,
mumbling
toothlessly
.
On
the
verandah
a
hammock
of
sail-cloth
,
*NL*
belonging
to
Cornelius
,
swayed
lightly
to
the
touch
of
Jim
's
elbow
.
It
*NL*
was
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Patusan
establishment
,
like
all
the
posts
of
Stein
's
Trading
*NL*
Company
,
had
originally
consisted
of
four
buildings
.
Two
of
them
were
*NL*
represented
by
two
heaps
of
sticks
,
broken
bamboos
,
rotten
thatch
,
*NL*
over
which
the
four
corner-posts
of
hardwood
leaned
sadly
at
different
*NL*
angles
:
the
principal
storeroom
,
however
,
stood
yet
,
facing
the
agent
's
*NL*
house
.
It
was
an
oblong
hut
,
built
of
mud
and
clay
;
it
had
at
one
end
a
*NL*
wide
door
of
stout
planking
,
which
so
far
had
not
come
off
the
hinges
,
*NL*
and
in
one
of
the
side
walls
there
was
a
square
aperture
,
a
sort
of
*NL*
window
,
with
three
wooden
bars
.
Before
descending
the
few
steps
the
girl
*NL*
turned
her
face
over
her
shoulder
and
said
quickly
,
``
You
were
to
be
set
*NL*
upon
while
you
slept
.
''
Jim
tells
me
he
experienced
a
sense
of
deception
.
*NL*
It
was
the
old
story
.
He
was
weary
of
these
attempts
upon
his
life
.
He
*NL*
had
had
his
fill
of
these
alarms
.
He
was
sick
of
them
.
He
assured
me
he
*NL*
was
angry
with
the
girl
for
deceiving
him
.
He
had
followed
her
under
the
*NL*
impression
that
it
was
she
who
wanted
his
help
,
and
now
he
had
half
*NL*
a
mind
to
turn
on
his
heel
and
go
back
in
disgust
.
``
Do
you
know
,
''
he
*NL*
commented
profoundly
,
``
I
rather
think
I
was
not
quite
myself
for
whole
*NL*
weeks
on
end
about
that
time
.
''
``
Oh
yes
.
You
were
though
,
''
I
could
n't
*NL*
help
contradicting
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
she
moved
on
swiftly
,
and
he
followed
her
into
the
courtyard
.
All
*NL*
its
fences
had
fallen
in
a
long
time
ago
;
the
neighbours
'
buffaloes
*NL*
would
pace
in
the
morning
across
the
open
space
,
snorting
profoundly
,
*NL*
without
haste
;
the
very
jungle
was
invading
it
already
.
Jim
and
the
girl
*NL*
stopped
in
the
rank
grass
.
The
light
in
which
they
stood
made
a
dense
*NL*
blackness
all
round
,
and
only
above
their
heads
there
was
an
opulent
*NL*
glitter
of
stars
.
He
told
me
it
was
a
beautiful
night
--
quite
cool
,
with
*NL*
a
little
stir
of
breeze
from
the
river
.
It
seems
he
noticed
its
friendly
*NL*
beauty
.
Remember
this
is
a
love
story
I
am
telling
you
now
.
A
lovely
*NL*
night
seemed
to
breathe
on
them
a
soft
caress
.
The
flame
of
the
torch
*NL*
streamed
now
and
then
with
a
fluttering
noise
like
a
flag
,
and
for
*NL*
a
time
this
was
the
only
sound
.
``
They
are
in
the
storeroom
waiting
,
''
*NL*
whispered
the
girl
;
``
they
are
waiting
for
the
signal
.
''
``
Who
's
to
give
*NL*
it
?
''
he
asked
.
She
shook
the
torch
,
which
blazed
up
after
a
shower
of
*NL*
sparks
.
``
Only
you
have
been
sleeping
so
restlessly
,
''
she
continued
in
*NL*
a
murmur
;
``
I
watched
your
sleep
,
too
.
''
``
You
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
craning
his
*NL*
neck
to
look
about
him
.
``
You
think
I
watched
on
this
night
only
!
''
she
*NL*
said
,
with
a
sort
of
despairing
indignation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
says
it
was
as
if
he
had
received
a
blow
on
the
chest
.
He
gasped
.
*NL*
He
thought
he
had
been
an
awful
brute
somehow
,
and
he
felt
remorseful
,
*NL*
touched
,
happy
,
elated
.
This
,
let
me
remind
you
again
,
is
a
love
story
;
*NL*
you
can
see
it
by
the
imbecility
,
not
a
repulsive
imbecility
,
the
*NL*
exalted
imbecility
of
these
proceedings
,
this
station
in
torchlight
,
as
*NL*
if
they
had
come
there
on
purpose
to
have
it
out
for
the
edification
of
*NL*
concealed
murderers
.
If
Sherif
Ali
's
emissaries
had
been
possessed
--
as
*NL*
Jim
remarked
--
of
a
pennyworth
of
spunk
,
this
was
the
time
to
make
a
*NL*
rush
.
His
heart
was
thumping
--
not
with
fear
--
but
he
seemed
to
hear
the
*NL*
grass
rustle
,
and
he
stepped
smartly
out
of
the
light
.
Something
dark
,
*NL*
imperfectly
seen
,
flitted
rapidly
out
of
sight
.
He
called
out
in
a
*NL*
strong
voice
,
``
Cornelius
!
O
Cornelius
!
''
A
profound
silence
succeeded
:
*NL*
his
voice
did
not
seem
to
have
carried
twenty
feet
.
Again
the
girl
was
*NL*
by
his
side
.
``
Fly
!
''
she
said
.
The
old
woman
was
coming
up
;
her
broken
*NL*
figure
hovered
in
crippled
little
jumps
on
the
edge
of
the
light
;
they
*NL*
heard
her
mumbling
,
and
a
light
,
moaning
sigh
.
``
Fly
!
''
repeated
the
girl
*NL*
excitedly
.
``
They
are
frightened
now
--
this
light
--
the
voices
.
They
know
*NL*
you
are
awake
now
--
they
know
you
are
big
,
strong
,
fearless
...
''
``
If
*NL*
I
am
all
that
,
''
he
began
;
but
she
interrupted
him
:
``
Yes
--
to-night
!
But
*NL*
what
of
to-morrow
night
?
Of
the
next
night
?
Of
the
night
after
--
of
all
*NL*
the
many
,
many
nights
?
Can
I
be
always
watching
?
''
A
sobbing
catch
of
her
*NL*
breath
affected
him
beyond
the
power
of
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
told
me
that
he
had
never
felt
so
small
,
so
powerless
--
and
as
to
*NL*
courage
,
what
was
the
good
of
it
?
he
thought
.
He
was
so
helpless
that
*NL*
even
flight
seemed
of
no
use
;
and
though
she
kept
on
whispering
,
``
Go
to
*NL*
Doramin
,
go
to
Doramin
,
''
with
feverish
insistence
,
he
realised
that
for
*NL*
him
there
was
no
refuge
from
that
loneliness
which
centupled
all
his
*NL*
dangers
except
--
in
her
.
``
I
thought
,
''
he
said
to
me
,
``
that
if
I
went
*NL*
away
from
her
it
would
be
the
end
of
everything
somehow
.
''
Only
as
they
*NL*
could
n't
stop
there
for
ever
in
the
middle
of
that
courtyard
,
he
made
*NL*
up
his
mind
to
go
and
look
into
the
storehouse
.
He
let
her
follow
*NL*
him
without
thinking
of
any
protest
,
as
if
they
had
been
indissolubly
*NL*
united
.
``
I
am
fearless
--
am
I
?
''
he
muttered
through
his
teeth
.
She
*NL*
restrained
his
arm
.
``
Wait
till
you
hear
my
voice
,
''
she
said
,
and
,
*NL*
torch
in
hand
,
ran
lightly
round
the
corner
.
He
remained
alone
in
the
*NL*
darkness
,
his
face
to
the
door
:
not
a
sound
,
not
a
breath
came
from
*NL*
the
other
side
.
The
old
hag
let
out
a
dreary
groan
somewhere
behind
his
*NL*
back
.
He
heard
a
high-pitched
almost
screaming
call
from
the
girl
.
``
Now
!
*NL*
Push
!
''
He
pushed
violently
;
the
door
swung
with
a
creak
and
a
clatter
,
*NL*
disclosing
to
his
intense
astonishment
the
low
dungeon-like
interior
*NL*
illuminated
by
a
lurid
,
wavering
glare
.
A
turmoil
of
smoke
eddied
down
*NL*
upon
an
empty
wooden
crate
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
,
a
litter
of
rags
*NL*
and
straw
tried
to
soar
,
but
only
stirred
feebly
in
the
draught
.
She
had
*NL*
thrust
the
light
through
the
bars
of
the
window
.
He
saw
her
bare
round
*NL*
arm
extended
and
rigid
,
holding
up
the
torch
with
the
steadiness
of
*NL*
an
iron
bracket
.
A
conical
ragged
heap
of
old
mats
cumbered
a
distant
*NL*
corner
almost
to
the
ceiling
,
and
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
explained
to
me
that
he
was
bitterly
disappointed
at
this
.
His
*NL*
fortitude
had
been
tried
by
so
many
warnings
,
he
had
been
for
weeks
*NL*
surrounded
by
so
many
hints
of
danger
,
that
he
wanted
the
relief
of
*NL*
some
reality
,
of
something
tangible
that
he
could
meet
.
``
It
would
have
*NL*
cleared
the
air
for
a
couple
of
hours
at
least
,
if
you
know
what
I
*NL*
mean
,
''
he
said
to
me
.
``
Jove
!
I
had
been
living
for
days
with
a
stone
on
*NL*
my
chest
.
''
Now
at
last
he
had
thought
he
would
get
hold
of
something
,
*NL*
and
--
nothing
!
Not
a
trace
,
not
a
sign
of
anybody
.
He
had
raised
his
*NL*
weapon
as
the
door
flew
open
,
but
now
his
arm
fell
.
``
Fire
!
Defend
*NL*
yourself
,
''
the
girl
outside
cried
in
an
agonising
voice
.
She
,
being
in
*NL*
the
dark
and
with
her
arm
thrust
in
to
the
shoulder
through
the
small
*NL*
hole
,
could
n't
see
what
was
going
on
,
and
she
dared
not
withdraw
*NL*
the
torch
now
to
run
round
.
``
There
's
nobody
here
!
''
yelled
Jim
*NL*
contemptuously
,
but
his
impulse
to
burst
into
a
resentful
exasperated
*NL*
laugh
died
without
a
sound
:
he
had
perceived
in
the
very
act
of
turning
*NL*
away
that
he
was
exchanging
glances
with
a
pair
of
eyes
in
the
heap
of
*NL*
mats
.
He
saw
a
shifting
gleam
of
whites
.
``
Come
out
!
''
he
cried
in
a
fury
,
*NL*
a
little
doubtful
,
and
a
dark-faced
head
,
a
head
without
a
body
,
shaped
*NL*
itself
in
the
rubbish
,
a
strangely
detached
head
,
that
looked
at
him
*NL*
with
a
steady
scowl
.
Next
moment
the
whole
mound
stirred
,
and
with
a
*NL*
low
grunt
a
man
emerged
swiftly
,
and
bounded
towards
Jim
.
Behind
him
the
*NL*
mats
as
it
were
jumped
and
flew
,
his
right
arm
was
raised
with
a
crooked
*NL*
elbow
,
and
the
dull
blade
of
a
kriss
protruded
from
his
fist
held
off
,
*NL*
a
little
above
his
head
.
A
cloth
wound
tight
round
his
loins
seemed
*NL*
dazzlingly
white
on
his
bronze
skin
;
his
naked
body
glistened
as
if
wet
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
noted
all
this
.
He
told
me
he
was
experiencing
a
feeling
of
*NL*
unutterable
relief
,
of
vengeful
elation
.
He
held
his
shot
,
he
says
,
*NL*
deliberately
.
He
held
it
for
the
tenth
part
of
a
second
,
for
three
*NL*
strides
of
the
man
--
an
unconscionable
time
.
He
held
it
for
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
saying
to
himself
,
That
's
a
dead
man
!
He
was
absolutely
positive
*NL*
and
certain
.
He
let
him
come
on
because
it
did
not
matter
.
A
dead
man
,
*NL*
anyhow
.
He
noticed
the
dilated
nostrils
,
the
wide
eyes
,
the
intent
,
*NL*
eager
stillness
of
the
face
,
and
then
he
fired
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
explosion
in
that
confined
space
was
stunning
.
He
stepped
back
a
*NL*
pace
.
He
saw
the
man
jerk
his
head
up
,
fling
his
arms
forward
,
and
drop
*NL*
the
kriss
.
He
ascertained
afterwards
that
he
had
shot
him
through
the
*NL*
mouth
,
a
little
upwards
,
the
bullet
coming
out
high
at
the
back
of
the
*NL*
skull
.
With
the
impetus
of
his
rush
the
man
drove
straight
on
,
his
face
*NL*
suddenly
gaping
disfigured
,
with
his
hands
open
before
him
gropingly
,
as
*NL*
though
blinded
,
and
landed
with
terrific
violence
on
his
forehead
,
just
*NL*
short
of
Jim
's
bare
toes
.
Jim
says
he
did
n't
lose
the
smallest
detail
*NL*
of
all
this
.
He
found
himself
calm
,
appeased
,
without
rancour
,
without
*NL*
uneasiness
,
as
if
the
death
of
that
man
had
atoned
for
everything
.
The
*NL*
place
was
getting
very
full
of
sooty
smoke
from
the
torch
,
in
which
*NL*
the
unswaying
flame
burned
blood-red
without
a
flicker
.
He
walked
in
*NL*
resolutely
,
striding
over
the
dead
body
,
and
covered
with
his
revolver
*NL*
another
naked
figure
outlined
vaguely
at
the
other
end
.
As
he
was
about
*NL*
to
pull
the
trigger
,
the
man
threw
away
with
force
a
short
heavy
spear
,
*NL*
and
squatted
submissively
on
his
hams
,
his
back
to
the
wall
and
his
*NL*
clasped
hands
between
his
legs
.
``
You
want
your
life
?
''
Jim
said
.
The
*NL*
other
made
no
sound
.
``
How
many
more
of
you
?
''
asked
Jim
again
.
``
Two
more
,
*NL*
Tuan
,
''
said
the
man
very
softly
,
looking
with
big
fascinated
eyes
into
*NL*
the
muzzle
of
the
revolver
.
Accordingly
two
more
crawled
from
under
the
*NL*
mats
,
holding
out
ostentatiously
their
empty
hands
.

CHAPTER
32
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
took
up
an
advantageous
position
and
shepherded
them
out
in
a
bunch
*NL*
through
the
doorway
:
all
that
time
the
torch
had
remained
vertical
in
*NL*
the
grip
of
a
little
hand
,
without
so
much
as
a
tremble
.
The
three
men
*NL*
obeyed
him
,
perfectly
mute
,
moving
automatically
.
He
ranged
them
in
a
*NL*
row
.
``
Link
arms
!
''
he
ordered
.
They
did
so
.
``
The
first
who
withdraws
his
*NL*
arm
or
turns
his
head
is
a
dead
man
,
''
he
said
.
``
March
!
''
They
stepped
out
*NL*
together
,
rigidly
;
he
followed
,
and
at
the
side
the
girl
,
in
a
trailing
*NL*
white
gown
,
her
black
hair
falling
as
low
as
her
waist
,
bore
the
light
.
*NL*
Erect
and
swaying
,
she
seemed
to
glide
without
touching
the
earth
;
the
*NL*
only
sound
was
the
silky
swish
and
rustle
of
the
long
grass
.
``
Stop
!
''
*NL*
cried
Jim
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
river-bank
was
steep
;
a
great
freshness
ascended
,
the
light
fell
on
*NL*
the
edge
of
smooth
dark
water
frothing
without
a
ripple
;
right
and
left
*NL*
the
shapes
of
the
houses
ran
together
below
the
sharp
outlines
of
the
*NL*
roofs
.
``
Take
my
greetings
to
Sherif
Ali
--
till
I
come
myself
,
''
said
*NL*
Jim
.
Not
one
head
of
the
three
budged
.
``
Jump
!
''
he
thundered
.
The
*NL*
three
splashes
made
one
splash
,
a
shower
flew
up
,
black
heads
bobbed
*NL*
convulsively
,
and
disappeared
;
but
a
great
blowing
and
spluttering
went
*NL*
on
,
growing
faint
,
for
they
were
diving
industriously
in
great
fear
of
*NL*
a
parting
shot
.
Jim
turned
to
the
girl
,
who
had
been
a
silent
and
*NL*
attentive
observer
.
His
heart
seemed
suddenly
to
grow
too
big
for
his
*NL*
breast
and
choke
him
in
the
hollow
of
his
throat
.
This
probably
made
*NL*
him
speechless
for
so
long
,
and
after
returning
his
gaze
she
flung
the
*NL*
burning
torch
with
a
wide
sweep
of
the
arm
into
the
river
.
The
ruddy
*NL*
fiery
glare
,
taking
a
long
flight
through
the
night
,
sank
with
a
vicious
*NL*
hiss
,
and
the
calm
soft
starlight
descended
upon
them
,
unchecked
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
did
not
tell
me
what
it
was
he
said
when
at
last
he
recovered
his
*NL*
voice
.
I
do
n't
suppose
he
could
be
very
eloquent
.
The
world
was
still
,
*NL*
the
night
breathed
on
them
,
one
of
those
nights
that
seem
created
for
*NL*
the
sheltering
of
tenderness
,
and
there
are
moments
when
our
souls
,
as
*NL*
if
freed
from
their
dark
envelope
,
glow
with
an
exquisite
sensibility
*NL*
that
makes
certain
silences
more
lucid
than
speeches
.
As
to
the
girl
,
*NL*
he
told
me
,
``
She
broke
down
a
bit
.
Excitement
--
do
n't
you
know
.
*NL*
Reaction
.
Deucedly
tired
she
must
have
been
--
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
.
*NL*
And
--
and
--
hang
it
all
--
she
was
fond
of
me
,
do
n't
you
see
...
I
*NL*
too
...
did
n't
know
,
of
course
...
never
entered
my
head
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
he
got
up
and
began
to
walk
about
in
some
agitation
.
``
I
--
I
love
*NL*
her
dearly
.
More
than
I
can
tell
.
Of
course
one
can
not
tell
.
You
take
a
*NL*
different
view
of
your
actions
when
you
come
to
understand
,
when
you
*NL*
are
_
made
_
to
understand
every
day
that
your
existence
is
necessary
--
you
*NL*
see
,
absolutely
necessary
--
to
another
person
.
I
am
made
to
feel
that
.
*NL*
Wonderful
!
But
only
try
to
think
what
her
life
has
been
.
It
is
too
*NL*
extravagantly
awful
!
Is
n't
it
?
And
me
finding
her
here
like
this
--
as
you
*NL*
may
go
out
for
a
stroll
and
come
suddenly
upon
somebody
drowning
in
a
*NL*
lonely
dark
place
.
Jove
!
No
time
to
lose
.
Well
,
it
is
a
trust
too
...
*NL*
I
believe
I
am
equal
to
it
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
must
tell
you
the
girl
had
left
us
to
ourselves
some
time
before
.
He
*NL*
slapped
his
chest
.
``
Yes
!
I
feel
that
,
but
I
believe
I
am
equal
to
all
my
*NL*
luck
!
''
He
had
the
gift
of
finding
a
special
meaning
in
everything
that
*NL*
happened
to
him
.
This
was
the
view
he
took
of
his
love
affair
;
it
was
*NL*
idyllic
,
a
little
solemn
,
and
also
true
,
since
his
belief
had
all
the
*NL*
unshakable
seriousness
of
youth
.
Some
time
after
,
on
another
occasion
,
*NL*
he
said
to
me
,
``
I
've
been
only
two
years
here
,
and
now
,
upon
my
word
,
I
*NL*
ca
n't
conceive
being
able
to
live
anywhere
else
.
The
very
thought
of
the
*NL*
world
outside
is
enough
to
give
me
a
fright
;
because
,
do
n't
you
see
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
with
downcast
eyes
watching
the
action
of
his
boot
busied
in
*NL*
squashing
thoroughly
a
tiny
bit
of
dried
mud
-LRB-
we
were
strolling
on
the
*NL*
river-bank
-RRB-
--
``
because
I
have
not
forgotten
why
I
came
here
.
Not
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
refrained
from
looking
at
him
,
but
I
think
I
heard
a
short
sigh
;
we
*NL*
took
a
turn
or
two
in
silence
.
``
Upon
my
soul
and
conscience
,
''
he
began
*NL*
again
,
``
if
such
a
thing
can
be
forgotten
,
then
I
think
I
have
a
right
to
*NL*
dismiss
it
from
my
mind
.
Ask
any
man
here
''
...
his
voice
changed
.
``
Is
*NL*
it
not
strange
,
''
he
went
on
in
a
gentle
,
almost
yearning
tone
,
``
that
all
*NL*
these
people
,
all
these
people
who
would
do
anything
for
me
,
can
never
*NL*
be
made
to
understand
?
Never
!
If
you
disbelieved
me
I
could
not
call
*NL*
them
up
.
It
seems
hard
,
somehow
.
I
am
stupid
,
am
I
not
?
What
more
can
I
*NL*
want
?
If
you
ask
them
who
is
brave
--
who
is
true
--
who
is
just
--
who
is
it
*NL*
they
would
trust
with
their
lives
?
--
they
would
say
,
Tuan
Jim
.
And
yet
*NL*
they
can
never
know
the
real
,
real
truth
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
's
what
he
said
to
me
on
my
last
day
with
him
.
I
did
not
let
a
*NL*
murmur
escape
me
:
I
felt
he
was
going
to
say
more
,
and
come
no
nearer
*NL*
to
the
root
of
the
matter
.
The
sun
,
whose
concentrated
glare
dwarfs
the
*NL*
earth
into
a
restless
mote
of
dust
,
had
sunk
behind
the
forest
,
and
*NL*
the
diffused
light
from
an
opal
sky
seemed
to
cast
upon
a
world
without
*NL*
shadows
and
without
brilliance
the
illusion
of
a
calm
and
pensive
*NL*
greatness
.
I
do
n't
know
why
,
listening
to
him
,
I
should
have
noted
*NL*
so
distinctly
the
gradual
darkening
of
the
river
,
of
the
air
;
the
*NL*
irresistible
slow
work
of
the
night
settling
silently
on
all
the
visible
*NL*
forms
,
effacing
the
outlines
,
burying
the
shapes
deeper
and
deeper
,
like
*NL*
a
steady
fall
of
impalpable
black
dust
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Jove
!
''
he
began
abruptly
,
``
there
are
days
when
a
fellow
is
too
absurd
*NL*
for
anything
;
only
I
know
I
can
tell
you
what
I
like
.
I
talk
about
*NL*
being
done
with
it
--
with
the
bally
thing
at
the
back
of
my
head
...
*NL*
Forgetting
...
Hang
me
if
I
know
!
I
can
think
of
it
quietly
.
After
*NL*
all
,
what
has
it
proved
?
Nothing
.
I
suppose
you
do
n't
think
so
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
made
a
protesting
murmur
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
No
matter
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
satisfied
...
nearly
.
I
've
got
to
*NL*
look
only
at
the
face
of
the
first
man
that
comes
along
,
to
regain
my
*NL*
confidence
.
They
ca
n't
be
made
to
understand
what
is
going
on
in
me
.
*NL*
What
of
that
?
Come
!
I
have
n't
done
so
badly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Not
so
badly
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
But
all
the
same
,
you
would
n't
like
to
have
me
aboard
your
own
ship
*NL*
hey
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Confound
you
!
''
I
cried
.
``
Stop
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Aha
!
You
see
,
''
he
said
,
crowing
,
as
it
were
,
over
me
placidly
.
``
Only
,
''
*NL*
he
went
on
,
``
you
just
try
to
tell
this
to
any
of
them
here
.
They
would
*NL*
think
you
a
fool
,
a
liar
,
or
worse
.
And
so
I
can
stand
it
.
I
've
done
a
*NL*
thing
or
two
for
them
,
but
this
is
what
they
have
done
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
My
dear
chap
,
''
I
cried
,
``
you
shall
always
remain
for
them
an
insoluble
*NL*
mystery
.
''
Thereupon
we
were
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Mystery
,
''
he
repeated
,
before
looking
up
.
``
Well
,
then
let
me
always
*NL*
remain
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
After
the
sun
had
set
,
the
darkness
seemed
to
drive
upon
us
,
borne
in
*NL*
every
faint
puff
of
the
breeze
.
In
the
middle
of
a
hedged
path
I
saw
the
*NL*
arrested
,
gaunt
,
watchful
,
and
apparently
one-legged
silhouette
of
Tamb
'
*NL*
Itam
;
and
across
the
dusky
space
my
eye
detected
something
white
moving
*NL*
to
and
fro
behind
the
supports
of
the
roof
.
As
soon
as
Jim
,
with
Tamb
'
*NL*
Itam
at
his
heels
,
had
started
upon
his
evening
rounds
,
I
went
up
to
the
*NL*
house
alone
,
and
,
unexpectedly
,
found
myself
waylaid
by
the
girl
,
who
*NL*
had
been
clearly
waiting
for
this
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
hard
to
tell
you
what
it
was
precisely
she
wanted
to
wrest
*NL*
from
me
.
Obviously
it
would
be
something
very
simple
--
the
simplest
*NL*
impossibility
in
the
world
;
as
,
for
instance
,
the
exact
description
of
*NL*
the
form
of
a
cloud
.
She
wanted
an
assurance
,
a
statement
,
a
promise
,
an
*NL*
explanation
--
I
do
n't
know
how
to
call
it
:
the
thing
has
no
name
.
It
was
*NL*
dark
under
the
projecting
roof
,
and
all
I
could
see
were
the
flowing
*NL*
lines
of
her
gown
,
the
pale
small
oval
of
her
face
,
with
the
white
flash
*NL*
of
her
teeth
,
and
,
turned
towards
me
,
the
big
sombre
orbits
of
her
eyes
,
*NL*
where
there
seemed
to
be
a
faint
stir
,
such
as
you
may
fancy
you
can
*NL*
detect
when
you
plunge
your
gaze
to
the
bottom
of
an
immensely
deep
*NL*
well
.
What
is
it
that
moves
there
?
you
ask
yourself
.
Is
it
a
blind
*NL*
monster
or
only
a
lost
gleam
from
the
universe
?
It
occurred
to
me
--
do
n't
*NL*
laugh
--
that
all
things
being
dissimilar
,
she
was
more
inscrutable
in
*NL*
her
childish
ignorance
than
the
Sphinx
propounding
childish
riddles
*NL*
to
wayfarers
.
She
had
been
carried
off
to
Patusan
before
her
eyes
*NL*
were
open
.
She
had
grown
up
there
;
she
had
seen
nothing
,
she
had
known
*NL*
nothing
,
she
had
no
conception
of
anything
.
I
ask
myself
whether
she
*NL*
were
sure
that
anything
else
existed
.
What
notions
she
may
have
formed
*NL*
of
the
outside
world
is
to
me
inconceivable
:
all
that
she
knew
of
its
*NL*
inhabitants
were
a
betrayed
woman
and
a
sinister
pantaloon
.
Her
lover
*NL*
also
came
to
her
from
there
,
gifted
with
irresistible
seductions
;
but
*NL*
what
would
become
of
her
if
he
should
return
to
these
inconceivable
*NL*
regions
that
seemed
always
to
claim
back
their
own
?
Her
mother
had
*NL*
warned
her
of
this
with
tears
,
before
she
died
...
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
had
caught
hold
of
my
arm
firmly
,
and
as
soon
as
I
had
stopped
she
*NL*
had
withdrawn
her
hand
in
haste
.
She
was
audacious
and
shrinking
.
She
*NL*
feared
nothing
,
but
she
was
checked
by
the
profound
incertitude
and
the
*NL*
extreme
strangeness
--
a
brave
person
groping
in
the
dark
.
I
belonged
to
*NL*
this
Unknown
that
might
claim
Jim
for
its
own
at
any
moment
.
I
was
,
*NL*
as
it
were
,
in
the
secret
of
its
nature
and
of
its
intentions
--
the
*NL*
confidant
of
a
threatening
mystery
--
armed
with
its
power
perhaps
!
I
*NL*
believe
she
supposed
I
could
with
a
word
whisk
Jim
away
out
of
her
very
*NL*
arms
;
it
is
my
sober
conviction
she
went
through
agonies
of
apprehension
*NL*
during
my
long
talks
with
Jim
;
through
a
real
and
intolerable
anguish
*NL*
that
might
have
conceivably
driven
her
into
plotting
my
murder
,
had
the
*NL*
fierceness
of
her
soul
been
equal
to
the
tremendous
situation
it
had
*NL*
created
.
This
is
my
impression
,
and
it
is
all
I
can
give
you
:
the
whole
*NL*
thing
dawned
gradually
upon
me
,
and
as
it
got
clearer
and
clearer
I
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
a
slow
incredulous
amazement
.
She
made
me
believe
her
,
*NL*
but
there
is
no
word
that
on
my
lips
could
render
the
effect
of
the
*NL*
headlong
and
vehement
whisper
,
of
the
soft
,
passionate
tones
,
of
the
*NL*
sudden
breathless
pause
and
the
appealing
movement
of
the
white
arms
*NL*
extended
swiftly
.
They
fell
;
the
ghostly
figure
swayed
like
a
slender
*NL*
tree
in
the
wind
,
the
pale
oval
of
the
face
drooped
;
it
was
impossible
*NL*
to
distinguish
her
features
,
the
darkness
of
the
eyes
was
unfathomable
;
*NL*
two
wide
sleeves
uprose
in
the
dark
like
unfolding
wings
,
and
she
stood
*NL*
silent
,
holding
her
head
in
her
hands
.

CHAPTER
33
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
immensely
touched
:
her
youth
,
her
ignorance
,
her
pretty
beauty
,
*NL*
which
had
the
simple
charm
and
the
delicate
vigour
of
a
wild-flower
,
*NL*
her
pathetic
pleading
,
her
helplessness
,
appealed
to
me
with
almost
*NL*
the
strength
of
her
own
unreasonable
and
natural
fear
.
She
feared
the
*NL*
unknown
as
we
all
do
,
and
her
ignorance
made
the
unknown
infinitely
*NL*
vast
.
I
stood
for
it
,
for
myself
,
for
you
fellows
,
for
all
the
world
*NL*
that
neither
cared
for
Jim
nor
needed
him
in
the
least
.
I
would
have
*NL*
been
ready
enough
to
answer
for
the
indifference
of
the
teeming
earth
*NL*
but
for
the
reflection
that
he
too
belonged
to
this
mysterious
unknown
*NL*
of
her
fears
,
and
that
,
however
much
I
stood
for
,
I
did
not
stand
for
*NL*
him
.
This
made
me
hesitate
.
A
murmur
of
hopeless
pain
unsealed
my
lips
.
*NL*
I
began
by
protesting
that
I
at
least
had
come
with
no
intention
to
take
*NL*
Jim
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Why
did
I
come
,
then
?
After
a
slight
movement
she
was
as
still
as
a
*NL*
marble
statue
in
the
night
.
I
tried
to
explain
briefly
:
friendship
,
*NL*
business
;
if
I
had
any
wish
in
the
matter
it
was
rather
to
see
him
stay
.
*NL*
...
``
They
always
leave
us
,
''
she
murmured
.
The
breath
of
sad
wisdom
*NL*
from
the
grave
which
her
piety
wreathed
with
flowers
seemed
to
pass
in
a
*NL*
faint
sigh
...
Nothing
,
I
said
,
could
separate
Jim
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
my
firm
conviction
now
;
it
was
my
conviction
at
the
time
;
it
was
*NL*
the
only
possible
conclusion
from
the
facts
of
the
case
.
It
was
not
made
*NL*
more
certain
by
her
whispering
in
a
tone
in
which
one
speaks
to
oneself
,
*NL*
``
He
swore
this
to
me
.
''
``
Did
you
ask
him
?
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
made
a
step
nearer
.
``
No
.
Never
!
''
She
had
asked
him
only
to
go
away
.
*NL*
It
was
that
night
on
the
river-bank
,
after
he
had
killed
the
man
--
after
*NL*
she
had
flung
the
torch
in
the
water
because
he
was
looking
at
her
so
.
*NL*
There
was
too
much
light
,
and
the
danger
was
over
then
--
for
a
little
*NL*
time
--
for
a
little
time
.
He
said
then
he
would
not
abandon
her
to
*NL*
Cornelius
.
She
had
insisted
.
She
wanted
him
to
leave
her
.
He
said
that
*NL*
he
could
not
--
that
it
was
impossible
.
He
trembled
while
he
said
this
.
*NL*
She
had
felt
him
tremble
...
One
does
not
require
much
imagination
*NL*
to
see
the
scene
,
almost
to
hear
their
whispers
.
She
was
afraid
for
him
*NL*
too
.
I
believe
that
then
she
saw
in
him
only
a
predestined
victim
of
*NL*
dangers
which
she
understood
better
than
himself
.
Though
by
nothing
*NL*
but
his
mere
presence
he
had
mastered
her
heart
,
had
filled
all
*NL*
her
thoughts
,
and
had
possessed
himself
of
all
her
affections
,
she
*NL*
underestimated
his
chances
of
success
.
It
is
obvious
that
at
about
*NL*
that
time
everybody
was
inclined
to
underestimate
his
chances
.
Strictly
*NL*
speaking
he
did
n't
seem
to
have
any
.
I
know
this
was
Cornelius
's
view
.
*NL*
He
confessed
that
much
to
me
in
extenuation
of
the
shady
part
he
had
*NL*
played
in
Sherif
Ali
's
plot
to
do
away
with
the
infidel
.
Even
Sherif
Ali
*NL*
himself
,
as
it
seems
certain
now
,
had
nothing
but
contempt
for
the
white
*NL*
man
.
Jim
was
to
be
murdered
mainly
on
religious
grounds
,
I
believe
.
A
*NL*
simple
act
of
piety
-LRB-
and
so
far
infinitely
meritorious
-RRB-
,
but
otherwise
*NL*
without
much
importance
.
In
the
last
part
of
this
opinion
Cornelius
*NL*
concurred
.
``
Honourable
sir
,
''
he
argued
abjectly
on
the
only
occasion
he
*NL*
managed
to
have
me
to
himself
--
``
honourable
sir
,
how
was
I
to
know
?
Who
*NL*
was
he
?
What
could
he
do
to
make
people
believe
him
?
What
did
Mr.
Stein
*NL*
mean
sending
a
boy
like
that
to
talk
big
to
an
old
servant
?
I
was
ready
*NL*
to
save
him
for
eighty
dollars
.
Only
eighty
dollars
.
Why
did
n't
the
*NL*
fool
go
?
Was
I
to
get
stabbed
myself
for
the
sake
of
a
stranger
?
''
He
*NL*
grovelled
in
spirit
before
me
,
with
his
body
doubled
up
insinuatingly
*NL*
and
his
hands
hovering
about
my
knees
,
as
though
he
were
ready
to
*NL*
embrace
my
legs
.
``
What
's
eighty
dollars
?
An
insignificant
sum
to
give
to
*NL*
a
defenceless
old
man
ruined
for
life
by
a
deceased
she-devil
.
''
Here
he
*NL*
wept
.
But
I
anticipate
.
I
did
n't
that
night
chance
upon
Cornelius
till
I
*NL*
had
had
it
out
with
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
was
unselfish
when
she
urged
Jim
to
leave
her
,
and
even
to
leave
*NL*
the
country
.
It
was
his
danger
that
was
foremost
in
her
thoughts
--
even
*NL*
if
she
wanted
to
save
herself
too
--
perhaps
unconsciously
:
but
then
look
*NL*
at
the
warning
she
had
,
look
at
the
lesson
that
could
be
drawn
from
*NL*
every
moment
of
the
recently
ended
life
in
which
all
her
memories
were
*NL*
centred
.
She
fell
at
his
feet
--
she
told
me
so
--
there
by
the
river
,
in
*NL*
the
discreet
light
of
stars
which
showed
nothing
except
great
masses
of
*NL*
silent
shadows
,
indefinite
open
spaces
,
and
trembling
faintly
upon
the
*NL*
broad
stream
made
it
appear
as
wide
as
the
sea
.
He
had
lifted
her
up
.
*NL*
He
lifted
her
up
,
and
then
she
would
struggle
no
more
.
Of
course
not
.
*NL*
Strong
arms
,
a
tender
voice
,
a
stalwart
shoulder
to
rest
her
poor
lonely
*NL*
little
head
upon
.
The
need
--
the
infinite
need
--
of
all
this
for
the
*NL*
aching
heart
,
for
the
bewildered
mind
;
--
the
promptings
of
youth
--
the
*NL*
necessity
of
the
moment
.
What
would
you
have
?
One
understands
--
unless
*NL*
one
is
incapable
of
understanding
anything
under
the
sun
.
And
so
she
was
*NL*
content
to
be
lifted
up
--
and
held
.
``
You
know
--
Jove
!
this
is
serious
--
no
*NL*
nonsense
in
it
!
''
as
Jim
had
whispered
hurriedly
with
a
troubled
*NL*
concerned
face
on
the
threshold
of
his
house
.
I
do
n't
know
so
much
about
*NL*
nonsense
,
but
there
was
nothing
light-hearted
in
their
romance
:
they
*NL*
came
together
under
the
shadow
of
a
life
's
disaster
,
like
knight
and
*NL*
maiden
meeting
to
exchange
vows
amongst
haunted
ruins
.
The
starlight
was
*NL*
good
enough
for
that
story
,
a
light
so
faint
and
remote
that
it
can
not
*NL*
resolve
shadows
into
shapes
,
and
show
the
other
shore
of
a
stream
.
I
*NL*
did
look
upon
the
stream
that
night
and
from
the
very
place
;
it
rolled
*NL*
silent
and
as
black
as
Styx
:
the
next
day
I
went
away
,
but
I
am
not
*NL*
likely
to
forget
what
it
was
she
wanted
to
be
saved
from
when
she
*NL*
entreated
him
to
leave
her
while
there
was
time
.
She
told
me
what
*NL*
it
was
,
calmed
--
she
was
now
too
passionately
interested
for
mere
*NL*
excitement
--
in
a
voice
as
quiet
in
the
obscurity
as
her
white
half-lost
*NL*
figure
.
She
told
me
,
``
I
did
n't
want
to
die
weeping
.
''
I
thought
I
had
not
*NL*
heard
aright
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
did
not
want
to
die
weeping
?
''
I
repeated
after
her
.
``
Like
my
*NL*
mother
,
''
she
added
readily
.
The
outlines
of
her
white
shape
did
not
*NL*
stir
in
the
least
.
``
My
mother
had
wept
bitterly
before
she
died
,
''
she
*NL*
explained
.
An
inconceivable
calmness
seemed
to
have
risen
from
the
*NL*
ground
around
us
,
imperceptibly
,
like
the
still
rise
of
a
flood
in
the
*NL*
night
,
obliterating
the
familiar
landmarks
of
emotions
.
There
came
*NL*
upon
me
,
as
though
I
had
felt
myself
losing
my
footing
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
waters
,
a
sudden
dread
,
the
dread
of
the
unknown
depths
.
She
went
on
*NL*
explaining
that
,
during
the
last
moments
,
being
alone
with
her
mother
,
*NL*
she
had
to
leave
the
side
of
the
couch
to
go
and
set
her
back
against
*NL*
the
door
,
in
order
to
keep
Cornelius
out
.
He
desired
to
get
in
,
and
*NL*
kept
on
drumming
with
both
fists
,
only
desisting
now
and
again
to
shout
*NL*
huskily
,
``
Let
me
in
!
Let
me
in
!
Let
me
in
!
''
In
a
far
corner
upon
a
few
*NL*
mats
the
moribund
woman
,
already
speechless
and
unable
to
lift
her
arm
,
*NL*
rolled
her
head
over
,
and
with
a
feeble
movement
of
her
hand
seemed
to
*NL*
command
--
``
No
!
No
!
''
and
the
obedient
daughter
,
setting
her
shoulders
with
*NL*
all
her
strength
against
the
door
,
was
looking
on
.
``
The
tears
fell
from
*NL*
her
eyes
--
and
then
she
died
,
''
concluded
the
girl
in
an
imperturbable
*NL*
monotone
,
which
more
than
anything
else
,
more
than
the
white
statuesque
*NL*
immobility
of
her
person
,
more
than
mere
words
could
do
,
troubled
my
*NL*
mind
profoundly
with
the
passive
,
irremediable
horror
of
the
scene
.
It
*NL*
had
the
power
to
drive
me
out
of
my
conception
of
existence
,
out
of
*NL*
that
shelter
each
of
us
makes
for
himself
to
creep
under
in
moments
of
*NL*
danger
,
as
a
tortoise
withdraws
within
its
shell
.
For
a
moment
I
had
*NL*
a
view
of
a
world
that
seemed
to
wear
a
vast
and
dismal
aspect
of
*NL*
disorder
,
while
,
in
truth
,
thanks
to
our
unwearied
efforts
,
it
is
*NL*
as
sunny
an
arrangement
of
small
conveniences
as
the
mind
of
man
can
*NL*
conceive
.
But
still
--
it
was
only
a
moment
:
I
went
back
into
my
shell
*NL*
directly
.
One
_
must
_
--
do
n't
you
know
?
--
though
I
seemed
to
have
lost
all
*NL*
my
words
in
the
chaos
of
dark
thoughts
I
had
contemplated
for
a
second
*NL*
or
two
beyond
the
pale
.
These
came
back
,
too
,
very
soon
,
for
words
also
*NL*
belong
to
the
sheltering
conception
of
light
and
order
which
is
our
*NL*
refuge
.
I
had
them
ready
at
my
disposal
before
she
whispered
softly
,
``
He
*NL*
swore
he
would
never
leave
me
,
when
we
stood
there
alone
!
He
swore
to
*NL*
me
!
''
...
``
And
it
is
possible
that
you
--
you
!
do
not
believe
him
?
''
*NL*
I
asked
,
sincerely
reproachful
,
genuinely
shocked
.
Why
could
n't
she
*NL*
believe
?
Wherefore
this
craving
for
incertitude
,
this
clinging
to
fear
,
*NL*
as
if
incertitude
and
fear
had
been
the
safeguards
of
her
love
.
It
was
*NL*
monstrous
.
She
should
have
made
for
herself
a
shelter
of
inexpugnable
*NL*
peace
out
of
that
honest
affection
.
She
had
not
the
knowledge
--
not
the
*NL*
skill
perhaps
.
The
night
had
come
on
apace
;
it
had
grown
pitch-dark
*NL*
where
we
were
,
so
that
without
stirring
she
had
faded
like
the
*NL*
intangible
form
of
a
wistful
and
perverse
spirit
.
And
suddenly
I
heard
*NL*
her
quiet
whisper
again
,
``
Other
men
had
sworn
the
same
thing
.
''
It
was
*NL*
like
a
meditative
comment
on
some
thoughts
full
of
sadness
,
of
awe
.
And
*NL*
she
added
,
still
lower
if
possible
,
``
My
father
did
.
''
She
paused
the
*NL*
time
to
draw
an
inaudible
breath
.
``
Her
father
too
.
''
...
These
were
the
*NL*
things
she
knew
!
At
once
I
said
,
``
Ah
!
but
he
is
not
like
that
.
''
This
,
*NL*
it
seemed
,
she
did
not
intend
to
dispute
;
but
after
a
time
the
strange
*NL*
still
whisper
wandering
dreamily
in
the
air
stole
into
my
ears
.
``
Why
*NL*
is
he
different
?
Is
he
better
?
Is
he
...
''
``
Upon
my
word
of
honour
,
''
I
*NL*
broke
in
,
``
I
believe
he
is
.
''
We
subdued
our
tones
to
a
mysterious
pitch
.
*NL*
Amongst
the
huts
of
Jim
's
workmen
-LRB-
they
were
mostly
liberated
slaves
*NL*
from
the
Sherif
's
stockade
-RRB-
somebody
started
a
shrill
,
drawling
song
.
*NL*
Across
the
river
a
big
fire
-LRB-
at
Doramin
's
,
I
think
-RRB-
made
a
glowing
*NL*
ball
,
completely
isolated
in
the
night
.
``
Is
he
more
true
?
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
I
said
.
``
More
true
than
any
other
man
,
''
she
repeated
in
*NL*
lingering
accents
.
``
Nobody
here
,
''
I
said
,
``
would
dream
of
doubting
his
*NL*
word
--
nobody
would
dare
--
except
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
think
she
made
a
movement
at
this
.
``
More
brave
,
''
she
went
on
in
a
*NL*
changed
tone
.
``
Fear
will
never
drive
him
away
from
you
,
''
I
said
a
little
*NL*
nervously
.
The
song
stopped
short
on
a
shrill
note
,
and
was
succeeded
by
*NL*
several
voices
talking
in
the
distance
.
Jim
's
voice
too
.
I
was
struck
*NL*
by
her
silence
.
``
What
has
he
been
telling
you
?
He
has
been
telling
you
*NL*
something
?
''
I
asked
.
There
was
no
answer
.
``
What
is
it
he
told
you
?
''
I
*NL*
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Do
you
think
I
can
tell
you
?
How
am
I
to
know
?
How
am
I
to
*NL*
understand
?
''
she
cried
at
last
.
There
was
a
stir
.
I
believe
she
was
*NL*
wringing
her
hands
.
``
There
is
something
he
can
never
forget
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
So
much
the
better
for
you
,
''
I
said
gloomily
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
is
it
?
What
is
it
?
''
She
put
an
extraordinary
force
of
appeal
into
*NL*
her
supplicating
tone
.
``
He
says
he
had
been
afraid
.
How
can
I
believe
*NL*
this
?
Am
I
a
mad
woman
to
believe
this
?
You
all
remember
something
!
You
*NL*
all
go
back
to
it
.
What
is
it
?
You
tell
me
!
What
is
this
thing
?
Is
it
*NL*
alive
?
--
is
it
dead
?
I
hate
it
.
It
is
cruel
.
Has
it
got
a
face
and
a
*NL*
voice
--
this
calamity
?
Will
he
see
it
--
will
he
hear
it
?
In
his
sleep
*NL*
perhaps
when
he
can
not
see
me
--
and
then
arise
and
go
.
Ah
!
I
shall
never
*NL*
forgive
him
.
My
mother
had
forgiven
--
but
I
,
never
!
Will
it
be
a
sign
--
a
*NL*
call
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
a
wonderful
experience
.
She
mistrusted
his
very
slumbers
--
and
*NL*
she
seemed
to
think
I
could
tell
her
why
!
Thus
a
poor
mortal
seduced
by
*NL*
the
charm
of
an
apparition
might
have
tried
to
wring
from
another
*NL*
ghost
the
tremendous
secret
of
the
claim
the
other
world
holds
over
a
*NL*
disembodied
soul
astray
amongst
the
passions
of
this
earth
.
The
very
*NL*
ground
on
which
I
stood
seemed
to
melt
under
my
feet
.
And
it
was
so
*NL*
simple
too
;
but
if
the
spirits
evoked
by
our
fears
and
our
unrest
have
*NL*
ever
to
vouch
for
each
other
's
constancy
before
the
forlorn
magicians
*NL*
that
we
are
,
then
I
--
I
alone
of
us
dwellers
in
the
flesh
--
have
shuddered
*NL*
in
the
hopeless
chill
of
such
a
task
.
A
sign
,
a
call
!
How
telling
in
its
*NL*
expression
was
her
ignorance
.
A
few
words
!
How
she
came
to
know
them
,
*NL*
how
she
came
to
pronounce
them
,
I
ca
n't
imagine
.
Women
find
their
*NL*
inspiration
in
the
stress
of
moments
that
for
us
are
merely
awful
,
*NL*
absurd
,
or
futile
.
To
discover
that
she
had
a
voice
at
all
was
enough
*NL*
to
strike
awe
into
the
heart
.
Had
a
spurned
stone
cried
out
in
pain
it
*NL*
could
not
have
appeared
a
greater
and
more
pitiful
miracle
.
These
few
*NL*
sounds
wandering
in
the
dark
had
made
their
two
benighted
lives
tragic
*NL*
to
my
mind
.
It
was
impossible
to
make
her
understand
.
I
chafed
silently
*NL*
at
my
impotence
.
And
Jim
,
too
--
poor
devil
!
Who
would
need
him
?
Who
would
*NL*
remember
him
?
He
had
what
he
wanted
.
His
very
existence
probably
had
*NL*
been
forgotten
by
this
time
.
They
had
mastered
their
fates
.
They
were
*NL*
tragic
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
immobility
before
me
was
clearly
expectant
,
and
my
part
was
to
*NL*
speak
for
my
brother
from
the
realm
of
forgetful
shade
.
I
was
deeply
*NL*
moved
at
my
responsibility
and
at
her
distress
.
I
would
have
given
*NL*
anything
for
the
power
to
soothe
her
frail
soul
,
tormenting
itself
in
*NL*
its
invincible
ignorance
like
a
small
bird
beating
about
the
cruel
*NL*
wires
of
a
cage
.
Nothing
easier
than
to
say
,
Have
no
fear
!
Nothing
more
*NL*
difficult
.
How
does
one
kill
fear
,
I
wonder
?
How
do
you
shoot
a
spectre
*NL*
through
the
heart
,
slash
off
its
spectral
head
,
take
it
by
its
spectral
*NL*
throat
?
It
is
an
enterprise
you
rush
into
while
you
dream
,
and
are
glad
*NL*
to
make
your
escape
with
wet
hair
and
every
limb
shaking
.
The
bullet
is
*NL*
not
run
,
the
blade
not
forged
,
the
man
not
born
;
even
the
winged
words
*NL*
of
truth
drop
at
your
feet
like
lumps
of
lead
.
You
require
for
such
a
*NL*
desperate
encounter
an
enchanted
and
poisoned
shaft
dipped
in
a
lie
too
*NL*
subtle
to
be
found
on
earth
.
An
enterprise
for
a
dream
,
my
masters
!
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
began
my
exorcism
with
a
heavy
heart
,
with
a
sort
of
sullen
anger
in
*NL*
it
too
.
Jim
's
voice
,
suddenly
raised
with
a
stern
intonation
,
carried
*NL*
across
the
courtyard
,
reproving
the
carelessness
of
some
dumb
sinner
by
*NL*
the
river-side
.
Nothing
--
I
said
,
speaking
in
a
distinct
murmur
--
there
*NL*
could
be
nothing
,
in
that
unknown
world
she
fancied
so
eager
to
rob
her
*NL*
of
her
happiness
,
there
was
nothing
,
neither
living
nor
dead
,
there
was
*NL*
no
face
,
no
voice
,
no
power
,
that
could
tear
Jim
from
her
side
.
I
drew
*NL*
breath
and
she
whispered
softly
,
``
He
told
me
so
.
''
``
He
told
you
the
*NL*
truth
,
''
I
said
.
``
Nothing
,
''
she
sighed
out
,
and
abruptly
turned
upon
me
*NL*
with
a
barely
audible
intensity
of
tone
:
``
Why
did
you
come
to
us
from
*NL*
out
there
?
He
speaks
of
you
too
often
.
You
make
me
afraid
.
Do
you
--
do
*NL*
you
want
him
?
''
A
sort
of
stealthy
fierceness
had
crept
into
our
hurried
*NL*
mutters
.
``
I
shall
never
come
again
,
''
I
said
bitterly
.
``
And
I
do
n't
want
*NL*
him
.
No
one
wants
him
.
''
``
No
one
,
''
she
repeated
in
a
tone
of
doubt
.
``
No
*NL*
one
,
''
I
affirmed
,
feeling
myself
swayed
by
some
strange
excitement
.
``
You
*NL*
think
him
strong
,
wise
,
courageous
,
great
--
why
not
believe
him
to
be
*NL*
true
too
?
I
shall
go
to-morrow
--
and
that
is
the
end
.
You
shall
never
be
*NL*
troubled
by
a
voice
from
there
again
.
This
world
you
do
n't
know
is
too
*NL*
big
to
miss
him
.
You
understand
?
Too
big
.
You
've
got
his
heart
in
your
*NL*
hand
.
You
must
feel
that
.
You
must
know
that
.
''
``
Yes
,
I
know
that
,
''
she
*NL*
breathed
out
,
hard
and
still
,
as
a
statue
might
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
felt
I
had
done
nothing
.
And
what
is
it
that
I
had
wished
to
do
?
I
am
*NL*
not
sure
now
.
At
the
time
I
was
animated
by
an
inexplicable
ardour
,
as
*NL*
if
before
some
great
and
necessary
task
--
the
influence
of
the
moment
*NL*
upon
my
mental
and
emotional
state
.
There
are
in
all
our
lives
*NL*
such
moments
,
such
influences
,
coming
from
the
outside
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
irresistible
,
incomprehensible
--
as
if
brought
about
by
the
mysterious
*NL*
conjunctions
of
the
planets
.
She
owned
,
as
I
had
put
it
to
her
,
his
*NL*
heart
.
She
had
that
and
everything
else
--
if
she
could
only
believe
it
.
*NL*
What
I
had
to
tell
her
was
that
in
the
whole
world
there
was
no
one
who
*NL*
ever
would
need
his
heart
,
his
mind
,
his
hand
.
It
was
a
common
fate
,
and
*NL*
yet
it
seemed
an
awful
thing
to
say
of
any
man
.
She
listened
without
*NL*
a
word
,
and
her
stillness
now
was
like
the
protest
of
an
invincible
*NL*
unbelief
.
What
need
she
care
for
the
world
beyond
the
forests
?
I
asked
.
*NL*
From
all
the
multitudes
that
peopled
the
vastness
of
that
unknown
there
*NL*
would
come
,
I
assured
her
,
as
long
as
he
lived
,
neither
a
call
nor
a
*NL*
sign
for
him
.
Never
.
I
was
carried
away
.
Never
!
Never
!
I
remember
with
*NL*
wonder
the
sort
of
dogged
fierceness
I
displayed
.
I
had
the
illusion
*NL*
of
having
got
the
spectre
by
the
throat
at
last
.
Indeed
the
whole
real
*NL*
thing
has
left
behind
the
detailed
and
amazing
impression
of
a
dream
.
*NL*
Why
should
she
fear
?
She
knew
him
to
be
strong
,
true
,
wise
,
brave
.
He
*NL*
was
all
that
.
Certainly
.
He
was
more
.
He
was
great
--
invincible
--
and
the
*NL*
world
did
not
want
him
,
it
had
forgotten
him
,
it
would
not
even
know
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
stopped
;
the
silence
over
Patusan
was
profound
,
and
the
feeble
dry
*NL*
sound
of
a
paddle
striking
the
side
of
a
canoe
somewhere
in
the
middle
*NL*
of
the
river
seemed
to
make
it
infinite
.
``
Why
?
''
she
murmured
.
I
felt
*NL*
that
sort
of
rage
one
feels
during
a
hard
tussle
.
The
spectre
was
trying
*NL*
to
slip
out
of
my
grasp
.
``
Why
?
''
she
repeated
louder
;
``
tell
me
!
''
And
as
*NL*
I
remained
confounded
,
she
stamped
with
her
foot
like
a
spoilt
child
.
*NL*
``
Why
?
Speak
.
''
``
You
want
to
know
?
''
I
asked
in
a
fury
.
``
Yes
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
``
Because
he
is
not
good
enough
,
''
I
said
brutally
.
During
the
moment
's
*NL*
pause
I
noticed
the
fire
on
the
other
shore
blaze
up
,
dilating
the
*NL*
circle
of
its
glow
like
an
amazed
stare
,
and
contract
suddenly
to
a
*NL*
red
pin-point
.
I
only
knew
how
close
to
me
she
had
been
when
I
felt
*NL*
the
clutch
of
her
fingers
on
my
forearm
.
Without
raising
her
voice
,
she
*NL*
threw
into
it
an
infinity
of
scathing
contempt
,
bitterness
,
and
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
This
is
the
very
thing
he
said
...
You
lie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
last
two
words
she
cried
at
me
in
the
native
dialect
.
``
Hear
me
*NL*
out
!
''
I
entreated
;
she
caught
her
breath
tremulously
,
flung
my
arm
away
.
*NL*
``
Nobody
,
nobody
is
good
enough
,
''
I
began
with
the
greatest
earnestness
.
*NL*
I
could
hear
the
sobbing
labour
of
her
breath
frightfully
quickened
.
I
*NL*
hung
my
head
.
What
was
the
use
?
Footsteps
were
approaching
;
I
slipped
*NL*
away
without
another
word
...

CHAPTER
34
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Marlow
swung
his
legs
out
,
got
up
quickly
,
and
staggered
a
little
,
as
*NL*
though
he
had
been
set
down
after
a
rush
through
space
.
He
leaned
his
*NL*
back
against
the
balustrade
and
faced
a
disordered
array
of
long
cane
*NL*
chairs
.
The
bodies
prone
in
them
seemed
startled
out
of
their
torpor
by
*NL*
his
movement
.
One
or
two
sat
up
as
if
alarmed
;
here
and
there
a
cigar
*NL*
glowed
yet
;
Marlow
looked
at
them
all
with
the
eyes
of
a
man
returning
*NL*
from
the
excessive
remoteness
of
a
dream
.
A
throat
was
cleared
;
a
calm
*NL*
voice
encouraged
negligently
,
`
Well
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
`
Nothing
,
'
said
Marlow
with
a
slight
start
.
`
He
had
told
her
--
that
's
*NL*
all
.
She
did
not
believe
him
--
nothing
more
.
As
to
myself
,
I
do
not
know
*NL*
whether
it
be
just
,
proper
,
decent
for
me
to
rejoice
or
to
be
sorry
.
For
*NL*
my
part
,
I
can
not
say
what
I
believed
--
indeed
I
do
n't
know
to
this
day
,
*NL*
and
never
shall
probably
.
But
what
did
the
poor
devil
believe
himself
?
*NL*
Truth
shall
prevail
--
do
n't
you
know
Magna
est
veritas
el
...
Yes
,
when
*NL*
it
gets
a
chance
.
There
is
a
law
,
no
doubt
--
and
likewise
a
law
regulates
*NL*
your
luck
in
the
throwing
of
dice
.
It
is
not
Justice
the
servant
of
men
,
*NL*
but
accident
,
hazard
,
Fortune
--
the
ally
of
patient
Time
--
that
holds
an
*NL*
even
and
scrupulous
balance
.
Both
of
us
had
said
the
very
same
thing
.
*NL*
Did
we
both
speak
the
truth
--
or
one
of
us
did
--
or
neither
?
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
Marlow
paused
,
crossed
his
arms
on
his
breast
,
and
in
a
changed
tone
--
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
said
we
lied
.
Poor
soul
!
Well
--
let
's
leave
it
to
Chance
,
whose
ally
*NL*
is
Time
,
that
can
not
be
hurried
,
and
whose
enemy
is
Death
,
that
will
not
*NL*
wait
.
I
had
retreated
--
a
little
cowed
,
I
must
own
.
I
had
tried
a
fall
*NL*
with
fear
itself
and
got
thrown
--
of
course
.
I
had
only
succeeded
in
*NL*
adding
to
her
anguish
the
hint
of
some
mysterious
collusion
,
of
an
*NL*
inexplicable
and
incomprehensible
conspiracy
to
keep
her
for
ever
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
And
it
had
come
easily
,
naturally
,
unavoidably
,
by
his
act
,
by
her
*NL*
own
act
!
It
was
as
though
I
had
been
shown
the
working
of
the
implacable
*NL*
destiny
of
which
we
are
the
victims
--
and
the
tools
.
It
was
appalling
*NL*
to
think
of
the
girl
whom
I
had
left
standing
there
motionless
;
Jim
's
*NL*
footsteps
had
a
fateful
sound
as
he
tramped
by
,
without
seeing
me
,
in
*NL*
his
heavy
laced
boots
.
``
What
?
No
lights
!
''
he
said
in
a
loud
,
surprised
*NL*
voice
.
``
What
are
you
doing
in
the
dark
--
you
two
?
''
Next
moment
he
caught
*NL*
sight
of
her
,
I
suppose
.
``
Hallo
,
girl
!
''
he
cried
cheerily
.
``
Hallo
,
boy
!
''
*NL*
she
answered
at
once
,
with
amazing
pluck
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
was
their
usual
greeting
to
each
other
,
and
the
bit
of
swagger
she
*NL*
would
put
into
her
rather
high
but
sweet
voice
was
very
droll
,
pretty
,
*NL*
and
childlike
.
It
delighted
Jim
greatly
.
This
was
the
last
occasion
on
*NL*
which
I
heard
them
exchange
this
familiar
hail
,
and
it
struck
a
chill
*NL*
into
my
heart
.
There
was
the
high
sweet
voice
,
the
pretty
effort
,
the
*NL*
swagger
;
but
it
all
seemed
to
die
out
prematurely
,
and
the
playful
call
*NL*
sounded
like
a
moan
.
It
was
too
confoundedly
awful
.
``
What
have
you
done
*NL*
with
Marlow
?
''
Jim
was
asking
;
and
then
,
``
Gone
down
--
has
he
?
Funny
I
*NL*
did
n't
meet
him
...
You
there
,
Marlow
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
did
n't
answer
.
I
was
n't
going
in
--
not
yet
at
any
rate
.
I
really
*NL*
could
n't
.
While
he
was
calling
me
I
was
engaged
in
making
my
escape
*NL*
through
a
little
gate
leading
out
upon
a
stretch
of
newly
cleared
*NL*
ground
.
No
;
I
could
n't
face
them
yet
.
I
walked
hastily
with
lowered
head
*NL*
along
a
trodden
path
.
The
ground
rose
gently
,
the
few
big
trees
had
been
*NL*
felled
,
the
undergrowth
had
been
cut
down
and
the
grass
fired
.
He
had
a
*NL*
mind
to
try
a
coffee-plantation
there
.
The
big
hill
,
rearing
its
double
*NL*
summit
coal-black
in
the
clear
yellow
glow
of
the
rising
moon
,
seemed
*NL*
to
cast
its
shadow
upon
the
ground
prepared
for
that
experiment
.
He
was
*NL*
going
to
try
ever
so
many
experiments
;
I
had
admired
his
energy
,
his
*NL*
enterprise
,
and
his
shrewdness
.
Nothing
on
earth
seemed
less
real
now
*NL*
than
his
plans
,
his
energy
,
and
his
enthusiasm
;
and
raising
my
eyes
,
I
*NL*
saw
part
of
the
moon
glittering
through
the
bushes
at
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
chasm
.
For
a
moment
it
looked
as
though
the
smooth
disc
,
falling
from
*NL*
its
place
in
the
sky
upon
the
earth
,
had
rolled
to
the
bottom
of
that
*NL*
precipice
:
its
ascending
movement
was
like
a
leisurely
rebound
;
it
*NL*
disengaged
itself
from
the
tangle
of
twigs
;
the
bare
contorted
limb
of
*NL*
some
tree
,
growing
on
the
slope
,
made
a
black
crack
right
across
its
*NL*
face
.
It
threw
its
level
rays
afar
as
if
from
a
cavern
,
and
in
this
*NL*
mournful
eclipse-like
light
the
stumps
of
felled
trees
uprose
very
dark
,
*NL*
the
heavy
shadows
fell
at
my
feet
on
all
sides
,
my
own
moving
shadow
,
*NL*
and
across
my
path
the
shadow
of
the
solitary
grave
perpetually
*NL*
garlanded
with
flowers
.
In
the
darkened
moonlight
the
interlaced
*NL*
blossoms
took
on
shapes
foreign
to
one
's
memory
and
colours
indefinable
*NL*
to
the
eye
,
as
though
they
had
been
special
flowers
gathered
by
no
man
,
*NL*
grown
not
in
this
world
,
and
destined
for
the
use
of
the
dead
alone
.
*NL*
Their
powerful
scent
hung
in
the
warm
air
,
making
it
thick
and
heavy
*NL*
like
the
fumes
of
incense
.
The
lumps
of
white
coral
shone
round
the
dark
*NL*
mound
like
a
chaplet
of
bleached
skulls
,
and
everything
around
was
so
*NL*
quiet
that
when
I
stood
still
all
sound
and
all
movement
in
the
world
*NL*
seemed
to
come
to
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
a
great
peace
,
as
if
the
earth
had
been
one
grave
,
and
for
a
*NL*
time
I
stood
there
thinking
mostly
of
the
living
who
,
buried
in
remote
*NL*
places
out
of
the
knowledge
of
mankind
,
still
are
fated
to
share
in
its
*NL*
tragic
or
grotesque
miseries
.
In
its
noble
struggles
too
--
who
knows
?
*NL*
The
human
heart
is
vast
enough
to
contain
all
the
world
.
It
is
valiant
*NL*
enough
to
bear
the
burden
,
but
where
is
the
courage
that
would
cast
it
*NL*
off
?
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
suppose
I
must
have
fallen
into
a
sentimental
mood
;
I
only
know
that
*NL*
I
stood
there
long
enough
for
the
sense
of
utter
solitude
to
get
hold
*NL*
of
me
so
completely
that
all
I
had
lately
seen
,
all
I
had
heard
,
and
the
*NL*
very
human
speech
itself
,
seemed
to
have
passed
away
out
of
existence
,
*NL*
living
only
for
a
while
longer
in
my
memory
,
as
though
I
had
been
the
*NL*
last
of
mankind
.
It
was
a
strange
and
melancholy
illusion
,
evolved
*NL*
half-consciously
like
all
our
illusions
,
which
I
suspect
only
to
be
*NL*
visions
of
remote
unattainable
truth
,
seen
dimly
.
This
was
,
indeed
,
one
*NL*
of
the
lost
,
forgotten
,
unknown
places
of
the
earth
;
I
had
looked
under
*NL*
its
obscure
surface
;
and
I
felt
that
when
to-morrow
I
had
left
it
for
*NL*
ever
,
it
would
slip
out
of
existence
,
to
live
only
in
my
memory
till
I
*NL*
myself
passed
into
oblivion
.
I
have
that
feeling
about
me
now
;
perhaps
*NL*
it
is
that
feeling
which
has
incited
me
to
tell
you
the
story
,
to
try
to
*NL*
hand
over
to
you
,
as
it
were
,
its
very
existence
,
its
reality
--
the
truth
*NL*
disclosed
in
a
moment
of
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cornelius
broke
upon
it
.
He
bolted
out
,
vermin-like
,
from
the
long
*NL*
grass
growing
in
a
depression
of
the
ground
.
I
believe
his
house
was
*NL*
rotting
somewhere
near
by
,
though
I
've
never
seen
it
,
not
having
been
*NL*
far
enough
in
that
direction
.
He
ran
towards
me
upon
the
path
;
his
feet
,
*NL*
shod
in
dirty
white
shoes
,
twinkled
on
the
dark
earth
;
he
pulled
himself
*NL*
up
,
and
began
to
whine
and
cringe
under
a
tall
stove-pipe
hat
.
His
*NL*
dried-up
little
carcass
was
swallowed
up
,
totally
lost
,
in
a
suit
of
*NL*
black
broadcloth
.
That
was
his
costume
for
holidays
and
ceremonies
,
and
*NL*
it
reminded
me
that
this
was
the
fourth
Sunday
I
had
spent
in
Patusan
.
*NL*
All
the
time
of
my
stay
I
had
been
vaguely
aware
of
his
desire
to
*NL*
confide
in
me
,
if
he
only
could
get
me
all
to
himself
.
He
hung
about
*NL*
with
an
eager
craving
look
on
his
sour
yellow
little
face
;
but
his
*NL*
timidity
had
kept
him
back
as
much
as
my
natural
reluctance
to
have
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
such
an
unsavoury
creature
.
He
would
have
succeeded
,
*NL*
nevertheless
,
had
he
not
been
so
ready
to
slink
off
as
soon
as
you
*NL*
looked
at
him
.
He
would
slink
off
before
Jim
's
severe
gaze
,
before
my
*NL*
own
,
which
I
tried
to
make
indifferent
,
even
before
Tamb
'
Itam
's
surly
,
*NL*
superior
glance
.
He
was
perpetually
slinking
away
;
whenever
seen
he
was
*NL*
seen
moving
off
deviously
,
his
face
over
his
shoulder
,
with
either
a
*NL*
mistrustful
snarl
or
a
woe-begone
,
piteous
,
mute
aspect
;
but
no
assumed
*NL*
expression
could
conceal
this
innate
irremediable
abjectness
of
his
*NL*
nature
,
any
more
than
an
arrangement
of
clothing
can
conceal
some
*NL*
monstrous
deformity
of
the
body
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
know
whether
it
was
the
demoralisation
of
my
utter
defeat
in
*NL*
my
encounter
with
a
spectre
of
fear
less
than
an
hour
ago
,
but
I
let
*NL*
him
capture
me
without
even
a
show
of
resistance
.
I
was
doomed
to
be
*NL*
the
recipient
of
confidences
,
and
to
be
confronted
with
unanswerable
*NL*
questions
.
It
was
trying
;
but
the
contempt
,
the
unreasoned
contempt
,
the
*NL*
man
's
appearance
provoked
,
made
it
easier
to
bear
.
He
could
n't
possibly
*NL*
matter
.
Nothing
mattered
,
since
I
had
made
up
my
mind
that
Jim
,
for
*NL*
whom
alone
I
cared
,
had
at
last
mastered
his
fate
.
He
had
told
me
he
*NL*
was
satisfied
...
nearly
.
This
is
going
further
than
most
of
us
dare
.
*NL*
I
--
who
have
the
right
to
think
myself
good
enough
--
dare
not
.
Neither
*NL*
does
any
of
you
here
,
I
suppose
?
...
'
*NL*
*NL*
Marlow
paused
,
as
if
expecting
an
answer
.
Nobody
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Quite
right
,
'
he
began
again
.
`
Let
no
soul
know
,
since
the
truth
can
be
*NL*
wrung
out
of
us
only
by
some
cruel
,
little
,
awful
catastrophe
.
But
he
*NL*
is
one
of
us
,
and
he
could
say
he
was
satisfied
...
nearly
.
Just
*NL*
fancy
this
!
Nearly
satisfied
.
One
could
almost
envy
him
his
catastrophe
.
*NL*
Nearly
satisfied
.
After
this
nothing
could
matter
.
It
did
not
matter
who
*NL*
suspected
him
,
who
trusted
him
,
who
loved
him
,
who
hated
him
--
especially
*NL*
as
it
was
Cornelius
who
hated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Yet
after
all
this
was
a
kind
of
recognition
.
You
shall
judge
of
a
man
*NL*
by
his
foes
as
well
as
by
his
friends
,
and
this
enemy
of
Jim
was
such
as
*NL*
no
decent
man
would
be
ashamed
to
own
,
without
,
however
,
making
too
*NL*
much
of
him
.
This
was
the
view
Jim
took
,
and
in
which
I
shared
;
but
Jim
*NL*
disregarded
him
on
general
grounds
.
``
My
dear
Marlow
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
feel
*NL*
that
if
I
go
straight
nothing
can
touch
me
.
Indeed
I
do
.
Now
you
have
*NL*
been
long
enough
here
to
have
a
good
look
round
--
and
,
frankly
,
do
n't
*NL*
you
think
I
am
pretty
safe
?
It
all
depends
upon
me
,
and
,
by
Jove
!
I
have
*NL*
lots
of
confidence
in
myself
.
The
worst
thing
he
could
do
would
be
to
*NL*
kill
me
,
I
suppose
.
I
do
n't
think
for
a
moment
he
would
.
He
could
n't
,
*NL*
you
know
--
not
if
I
were
myself
to
hand
him
a
loaded
rifle
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
and
then
turn
my
back
on
him
.
That
's
the
sort
of
thing
he
is
.
*NL*
And
suppose
he
would
--
suppose
he
could
?
Well
--
what
of
that
?
I
did
n't
*NL*
come
here
flying
for
my
life
--
did
I
?
I
came
here
to
set
my
back
against
*NL*
the
wall
,
and
I
am
going
to
stay
here
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Till
you
are
_
quite
_
satisfied
,
''
I
struck
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
were
sitting
at
the
time
under
the
roof
in
the
stern
of
his
boat
;
*NL*
twenty
paddles
flashed
like
one
,
ten
on
a
side
,
striking
the
water
with
*NL*
a
single
splash
,
while
behind
our
backs
Tamb
'
Itam
dipped
silently
right
*NL*
and
left
,
and
stared
right
down
the
river
,
attentive
to
keep
the
long
*NL*
canoe
in
the
greatest
strength
of
the
current
.
Jim
bowed
his
head
,
and
*NL*
our
last
talk
seemed
to
flicker
out
for
good
.
He
was
seeing
me
off
as
*NL*
far
as
the
mouth
of
the
river
.
The
schooner
had
left
the
day
before
,
*NL*
working
down
and
drifting
on
the
ebb
,
while
I
had
prolonged
my
stay
*NL*
overnight
.
And
now
he
was
seeing
me
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
had
been
a
little
angry
with
me
for
mentioning
Cornelius
at
all
.
*NL*
I
had
not
,
in
truth
,
said
much
.
The
man
was
too
insignificant
to
be
*NL*
dangerous
,
though
he
was
as
full
of
hate
as
he
could
hold
.
He
had
called
*NL*
me
``
honourable
sir
''
at
every
second
sentence
,
and
had
whined
at
my
elbow
*NL*
as
he
followed
me
from
the
grave
of
his
``
late
wife
''
to
the
gate
of
Jim
's
*NL*
compound
.
He
declared
himself
the
most
unhappy
of
men
,
a
victim
,
crushed
*NL*
like
a
worm
;
he
entreated
me
to
look
at
him
.
I
would
n't
turn
my
head
to
*NL*
do
so
;
but
I
could
see
out
of
the
corner
of
my
eye
his
obsequious
shadow
*NL*
gliding
after
mine
,
while
the
moon
,
suspended
on
our
right
hand
,
seemed
*NL*
to
gloat
serenely
upon
the
spectacle
.
He
tried
to
explain
--
as
I
've
told
*NL*
you
--
his
share
in
the
events
of
the
memorable
night
.
It
was
a
matter
of
*NL*
expediency
.
How
could
he
know
who
was
going
to
get
the
upper
hand
?
``
I
*NL*
would
have
saved
him
,
honourable
sir
!
I
would
have
saved
him
for
eighty
*NL*
dollars
,
''
he
protested
in
dulcet
tones
,
keeping
a
pace
behind
me
.
``
He
*NL*
has
saved
himself
,
''
I
said
,
``
and
he
has
forgiven
you
.
''
I
heard
a
sort
of
*NL*
tittering
,
and
turned
upon
him
;
at
once
he
appeared
ready
to
take
to
his
*NL*
heels
.
``
What
are
you
laughing
at
?
''
I
asked
,
standing
still
.
``
Do
n't
be
*NL*
deceived
,
honourable
sir
!
''
he
shrieked
,
seemingly
losing
all
control
*NL*
over
his
feelings
.
''
_
He
_
save
himself
!
He
knows
nothing
,
honourable
*NL*
sir
--
nothing
whatever
.
Who
is
he
?
What
does
he
want
here
--
the
big
thief
?
*NL*
What
does
he
want
here
?
He
throws
dust
into
everybody
's
eyes
;
he
throws
*NL*
dust
into
your
eyes
,
honourable
sir
;
but
he
ca
n't
throw
dust
into
my
*NL*
eyes
.
He
is
a
big
fool
,
honourable
sir
.
''
I
laughed
contemptuously
,
and
,
*NL*
turning
on
my
heel
,
began
to
walk
on
again
.
He
ran
up
to
my
elbow
and
*NL*
whispered
forcibly
,
``
He
's
no
more
than
a
little
child
here
--
like
a
*NL*
little
child
--
a
little
child
.
''
Of
course
I
did
n't
take
the
slightest
*NL*
notice
,
and
seeing
the
time
pressed
,
because
we
were
approaching
the
*NL*
bamboo
fence
that
glittered
over
the
blackened
ground
of
the
clearing
,
*NL*
he
came
to
the
point
.
He
commenced
by
being
abjectly
lachrymose
.
His
*NL*
great
misfortunes
had
affected
his
head
.
He
hoped
I
would
kindly
forget
*NL*
what
nothing
but
his
troubles
made
him
say
.
He
did
n't
mean
anything
*NL*
by
it
;
only
the
honourable
sir
did
not
know
what
it
was
to
be
ruined
,
*NL*
broken
down
,
trampled
upon
.
After
this
introduction
he
approached
the
*NL*
matter
near
his
heart
,
but
in
such
a
rambling
,
ejaculatory
,
craven
*NL*
fashion
,
that
for
a
long
time
I
could
n't
make
out
what
he
was
driving
*NL*
at
.
He
wanted
me
to
intercede
with
Jim
in
his
favour
.
It
seemed
,
too
,
*NL*
to
be
some
sort
of
money
affair
.
I
heard
time
and
again
the
words
,
*NL*
``
Moderate
provision
--
suitable
present
.
''
He
seemed
to
be
claiming
value
*NL*
for
something
,
and
he
even
went
the
length
of
saying
with
some
warmth
*NL*
that
life
was
not
worth
having
if
a
man
were
to
be
robbed
of
everything
.
*NL*
I
did
not
breathe
a
word
,
of
course
,
but
neither
did
I
stop
my
ears
.
*NL*
The
gist
of
the
affair
,
which
became
clear
to
me
gradually
,
was
in
this
,
*NL*
that
he
regarded
himself
as
entitled
to
some
money
in
exchange
for
the
*NL*
girl
.
He
had
brought
her
up
.
Somebody
else
's
child
.
Great
trouble
and
*NL*
pains
--
old
man
now
--
suitable
present
.
If
the
honourable
sir
would
say
*NL*
a
word
...
I
stood
still
to
look
at
him
with
curiosity
,
and
fearful
*NL*
lest
I
should
think
him
extortionate
,
I
suppose
,
he
hastily
brought
*NL*
himself
to
make
a
concession
.
In
consideration
of
a
``
suitable
present
''
*NL*
given
at
once
,
he
would
,
he
declared
,
be
willing
to
undertake
the
charge
*NL*
of
the
girl
,
``
without
any
other
provision
--
when
the
time
came
for
the
*NL*
gentleman
to
go
home
.
''
His
little
yellow
face
,
all
crumpled
as
though
it
*NL*
had
been
squeezed
together
,
expressed
the
most
anxious
,
eager
avarice
.
*NL*
His
voice
whined
coaxingly
,
``
No
more
trouble
--
natural
guardian
--
a
sum
of
*NL*
money
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
stood
there
and
marvelled
.
That
kind
of
thing
,
with
him
,
was
*NL*
evidently
a
vocation
.
I
discovered
suddenly
in
his
cringing
attitude
*NL*
a
sort
of
assurance
,
as
though
he
had
been
all
his
life
dealing
in
*NL*
certitudes
.
He
must
have
thought
I
was
dispassionately
considering
his
*NL*
proposal
,
because
he
became
as
sweet
as
honey
.
``
Every
gentleman
made
*NL*
a
provision
when
the
time
came
to
go
home
,
''
he
began
insinuatingly
.
I
*NL*
slammed
the
little
gate
.
``
In
this
case
,
Mr.
Cornelius
,
''
I
said
,
``
the
*NL*
time
will
never
come
.
''
He
took
a
few
seconds
to
gather
this
in
.
``
What
!
''
*NL*
he
fairly
squealed
.
``
Why
,
''
I
continued
from
my
side
of
the
gate
,
*NL*
``
have
n't
you
heard
him
say
so
himself
?
He
will
never
go
home
.
''
``
Oh
!
this
*NL*
is
too
much
,
''
he
shouted
.
He
would
not
address
me
as
``
honoured
sir
''
any
*NL*
more
.
He
was
very
still
for
a
time
,
and
then
without
a
trace
of
humility
*NL*
began
very
low
:
``
Never
go
--
ah
!
He
--
he
--
he
comes
here
devil
knows
*NL*
from
where
--
comes
here
--
devil
knows
why
--
to
trample
on
me
till
I
*NL*
die
--
ah
--
trample
''
-LRB-
he
stamped
softly
with
both
feet
-RRB-
,
``
trample
like
*NL*
this
--
nobody
knows
why
--
till
I
die
...
''
His
voice
became
quite
*NL*
extinct
;
he
was
bothered
by
a
little
cough
;
he
came
up
close
to
the
*NL*
fence
and
told
me
,
dropping
into
a
confidential
and
piteous
tone
,
*NL*
that
he
would
not
be
trampled
upon
.
``
Patience
--
patience
,
''
he
muttered
,
*NL*
striking
his
breast
.
I
had
done
laughing
at
him
,
but
unexpectedly
he
*NL*
treated
me
to
a
wild
cracked
burst
of
it
.
``
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
We
shall
see
!
We
*NL*
shall
see
!
What
!
Steal
from
me
!
Steal
from
me
everything
!
Everything
!
*NL*
Everything
!
''
His
head
drooped
on
one
shoulder
,
his
hands
were
hanging
*NL*
before
him
lightly
clasped
.
One
would
have
thought
he
had
cherished
*NL*
the
girl
with
surpassing
love
,
that
his
spirit
had
been
crushed
and
his
*NL*
heart
broken
by
the
most
cruel
of
spoliations
.
Suddenly
he
lifted
his
*NL*
head
and
shot
out
an
infamous
word
.
``
Like
her
mother
--
she
is
like
her
*NL*
deceitful
mother
.
Exactly
.
In
her
face
,
too
.
In
her
face
.
The
devil
!
''
*NL*
He
leaned
his
forehead
against
the
fence
,
and
in
that
position
*NL*
uttered
threats
and
horrible
blasphemies
in
Portuguese
in
very
weak
*NL*
ejaculations
,
mingled
with
miserable
plaints
and
groans
,
coming
out
with
*NL*
a
heave
of
the
shoulders
as
though
he
had
been
overtaken
by
a
deadly
fit
*NL*
of
sickness
.
It
was
an
inexpressibly
grotesque
and
vile
performance
,
*NL*
and
I
hastened
away
.
He
tried
to
shout
something
after
me
.
Some
*NL*
disparagement
of
Jim
,
I
believe
--
not
too
loud
though
,
we
were
too
near
*NL*
the
house
.
All
I
heard
distinctly
was
,
``
No
more
than
a
little
child
--
a
*NL*
little
child
.

CHAPTER
35
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
next
morning
,
at
the
first
bend
of
the
river
shutting
off
the
*NL*
houses
of
Patusan
,
all
this
dropped
out
of
my
sight
bodily
,
with
its
*NL*
colour
,
its
design
,
and
its
meaning
,
like
a
picture
created
by
fancy
on
*NL*
a
canvas
,
upon
which
,
after
long
contemplation
,
you
turn
your
back
for
*NL*
the
last
time
.
It
remains
in
the
memory
motionless
,
unfaded
,
with
its
*NL*
life
arrested
,
in
an
unchanging
light
.
There
are
the
ambitions
,
the
*NL*
fears
,
the
hate
,
the
hopes
,
and
they
remain
in
my
mind
just
as
I
had
*NL*
seen
them
--
intense
and
as
if
for
ever
suspended
in
their
expression
.
I
*NL*
had
turned
away
from
the
picture
and
was
going
back
to
the
world
where
*NL*
events
move
,
men
change
,
light
flickers
,
life
flows
in
a
clear
stream
,
*NL*
no
matter
whether
over
mud
or
over
stones
.
I
was
n't
going
to
dive
into
*NL*
it
;
I
would
have
enough
to
do
to
keep
my
head
above
the
surface
.
But
*NL*
as
to
what
I
was
leaving
behind
,
I
can
not
imagine
any
alteration
.
The
*NL*
immense
and
magnanimous
Doramin
and
his
little
motherly
witch
of
a
*NL*
wife
,
gazing
together
upon
the
land
and
nursing
secretly
their
dreams
*NL*
of
parental
ambition
;
Tunku
Allang
,
wizened
and
greatly
perplexed
;
*NL*
Dain
Waris
,
intelligent
and
brave
,
with
his
faith
in
Jim
,
with
his
*NL*
firm
glance
and
his
ironic
friendliness
;
the
girl
,
absorbed
in
her
*NL*
frightened
,
suspicious
adoration
;
Tamb
'
Itam
,
surly
and
faithful
;
*NL*
Cornelius
,
leaning
his
forehead
against
the
fence
under
the
moonlight
--
I
*NL*
am
certain
of
them
.
They
exist
as
if
under
an
enchanter
's
wand
.
But
the
*NL*
figure
round
which
all
these
are
grouped
--
that
one
lives
,
and
I
am
not
*NL*
certain
of
him
.
No
magician
's
wand
can
immobilise
him
under
my
eyes
.
He
*NL*
is
one
of
us
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
,
as
I
've
told
you
,
accompanied
me
on
the
first
stage
of
my
journey
*NL*
back
to
the
world
he
had
renounced
,
and
the
way
at
times
seemed
to
*NL*
lead
through
the
very
heart
of
untouched
wilderness
.
The
empty
reaches
*NL*
sparkled
under
the
high
sun
;
between
the
high
walls
of
vegetation
the
*NL*
heat
drowsed
upon
the
water
,
and
the
boat
,
impelled
vigorously
,
cut
her
*NL*
way
through
the
air
that
seemed
to
have
settled
dense
and
warm
under
the
*NL*
shelter
of
lofty
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
shadow
of
the
impending
separation
had
already
put
an
immense
space
*NL*
between
us
,
and
when
we
spoke
it
was
with
an
effort
,
as
if
to
force
our
*NL*
low
voices
across
a
vast
and
increasing
distance
.
The
boat
fairly
flew
;
*NL*
we
sweltered
side
by
side
in
the
stagnant
superheated
air
;
the
smell
of
*NL*
mud
,
of
mush
,
the
primeval
smell
of
fecund
earth
,
seemed
to
sting
our
*NL*
faces
;
till
suddenly
at
a
bend
it
was
as
if
a
great
hand
far
away
had
*NL*
lifted
a
heavy
curtain
,
had
flung
open
un
immense
portal
.
The
light
*NL*
itself
seemed
to
stir
,
the
sky
above
our
heads
widened
,
a
far-off
murmur
*NL*
reached
our
ears
,
a
freshness
enveloped
us
,
filled
our
lungs
,
quickened
*NL*
our
thoughts
,
our
blood
,
our
regrets
--
and
,
straight
ahead
,
the
forests
*NL*
sank
down
against
the
dark-blue
ridge
of
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
breathed
deeply
,
I
revelled
in
the
vastness
of
the
opened
horizon
,
in
*NL*
the
different
atmosphere
that
seemed
to
vibrate
with
the
toil
of
life
,
*NL*
with
the
energy
of
an
impeccable
world
.
This
sky
and
this
sea
were
open
*NL*
to
me
.
The
girl
was
right
--
there
was
a
sign
,
a
call
in
them
--
something
*NL*
to
which
I
responded
with
every
fibre
of
my
being
.
I
let
my
eyes
roam
*NL*
through
space
,
like
a
man
released
from
bonds
who
stretches
his
cramped
*NL*
limbs
,
runs
,
leaps
,
responds
to
the
inspiring
elation
of
freedom
.
``
This
*NL*
is
glorious
!
''
I
cried
,
and
then
I
looked
at
the
sinner
by
my
side
.
He
*NL*
sat
with
his
head
sunk
on
his
breast
and
said
``
Yes
,
''
without
raising
his
*NL*
eyes
,
as
if
afraid
to
see
writ
large
on
the
clear
sky
of
the
offing
the
*NL*
reproach
of
his
romantic
conscience
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
remember
the
smallest
details
of
that
afternoon
.
We
landed
on
a
bit
*NL*
of
white
beach
.
It
was
backed
by
a
low
cliff
wooded
on
the
brow
,
draped
*NL*
in
creepers
to
the
very
foot
.
Below
us
the
plain
of
the
sea
,
of
a
serene
*NL*
and
intense
blue
,
stretched
with
a
slight
upward
tilt
to
the
thread-like
*NL*
horizon
drawn
at
the
height
of
our
eyes
.
Great
waves
of
glitter
blew
*NL*
lightly
along
the
pitted
dark
surface
,
as
swift
as
feathers
chased
by
*NL*
the
breeze
.
A
chain
of
islands
sat
broken
and
massive
facing
the
wide
*NL*
estuary
,
displayed
in
a
sheet
of
pale
glassy
water
reflecting
faithfully
*NL*
the
contour
of
the
shore
.
High
in
the
colourless
sunshine
a
solitary
*NL*
bird
,
all
black
,
hovered
,
dropping
and
soaring
above
the
same
spot
with
*NL*
a
slight
rocking
motion
of
the
wings
.
A
ragged
,
sooty
bunch
of
flimsy
*NL*
mat
hovels
was
perched
over
its
own
inverted
image
upon
a
crooked
*NL*
multitude
of
high
piles
the
colour
of
ebony
.
A
tiny
black
canoe
put
off
*NL*
from
amongst
them
with
two
tiny
men
,
all
black
,
who
toiled
exceedingly
,
*NL*
striking
down
at
the
pale
water
:
and
the
canoe
seemed
to
slide
painfully
*NL*
on
a
mirror
.
This
bunch
of
miserable
hovels
was
the
fishing
village
*NL*
that
boasted
of
the
white
lord
's
especial
protection
,
and
the
two
men
*NL*
crossing
over
were
the
old
headman
and
his
son-in-law
.
They
landed
*NL*
and
walked
up
to
us
on
the
white
sand
,
lean
,
dark-brown
as
if
dried
*NL*
in
smoke
,
with
ashy
patches
on
the
skin
of
their
naked
shoulders
*NL*
and
breasts
.
Their
heads
were
bound
in
dirty
but
carefully
folded
*NL*
headkerchiefs
,
and
the
old
man
began
at
once
to
state
a
complaint
,
*NL*
voluble
,
stretching
a
lank
arm
,
screwing
up
at
Jim
his
old
bleared
eyes
*NL*
confidently
.
The
Rajah
's
people
would
not
leave
them
alone
;
there
had
*NL*
been
some
trouble
about
a
lot
of
turtles
'
eggs
his
people
had
collected
*NL*
on
the
islets
there
--
and
leaning
at
arm
's
-
length
upon
his
paddle
,
he
*NL*
pointed
with
a
brown
skinny
hand
over
the
sea
.
Jim
listened
for
a
time
*NL*
without
looking
up
,
and
at
last
told
him
gently
to
wait
.
He
would
hear
*NL*
him
by-and-by
.
They
withdrew
obediently
to
some
little
distance
,
and
sat
*NL*
on
their
heels
,
with
their
paddles
lying
before
them
on
the
sand
;
the
*NL*
silvery
gleams
in
their
eyes
followed
our
movements
patiently
;
and
the
*NL*
immensity
of
the
outspread
sea
,
the
stillness
of
the
coast
,
passing
*NL*
north
and
south
beyond
the
limits
of
my
vision
,
made
up
one
colossal
*NL*
Presence
watching
us
four
dwarfs
isolated
on
a
strip
of
glistening
sand
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
The
trouble
is
,
''
remarked
Jim
moodily
,
``
that
for
generations
these
*NL*
beggars
of
fishermen
in
that
village
there
had
been
considered
as
the
*NL*
Rajah
's
personal
slaves
--
and
the
old
rip
ca
n't
get
it
into
his
head
that
*NL*
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
paused
.
``
That
you
have
changed
all
that
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Yes
I
've
changed
all
that
,
''
he
muttered
in
a
gloomy
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
have
had
your
opportunity
,
''
I
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Have
I
?
''
he
said
.
``
Well
,
yes
.
I
suppose
so
.
Yes
.
I
have
got
back
my
*NL*
confidence
in
myself
--
a
good
name
--
yet
sometimes
I
wish
...
No
!
I
*NL*
shall
hold
what
I
've
got
.
Ca
n't
expect
anything
more
.
''
He
flung
his
arm
*NL*
out
towards
the
sea
.
``
Not
out
there
anyhow
.
''
He
stamped
his
foot
upon
*NL*
the
sand
.
``
This
is
my
limit
,
because
nothing
less
will
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
continued
pacing
the
beach
.
``
Yes
,
I
've
changed
all
that
,
''
he
went
*NL*
on
,
with
a
sidelong
glance
at
the
two
patient
squatting
fishermen
;
``
but
*NL*
only
try
to
think
what
it
would
be
if
I
went
away
.
Jove
!
ca
n't
you
see
*NL*
it
?
Hell
loose
.
No
!
To-morrow
I
shall
go
and
take
my
chance
of
drinking
*NL*
that
silly
old
Tunku
Allang
's
coffee
,
and
I
shall
make
no
end
of
fuss
*NL*
over
these
rotten
turtles
'
eggs
.
No
.
I
ca
n't
say
--
enough
.
Never
.
I
must
*NL*
go
on
,
go
on
for
ever
holding
up
my
end
,
to
feel
sure
that
nothing
can
*NL*
touch
me
.
I
must
stick
to
their
belief
in
me
to
feel
safe
and
to
--
to
''
*NL*
...
He
cast
about
for
a
word
,
seemed
to
look
for
it
on
the
sea
...
*NL*
``
to
keep
in
touch
with
''
...
His
voice
sank
suddenly
to
a
murmur
...
*NL*
``
with
those
whom
,
perhaps
,
I
shall
never
see
any
more
.
With
--
with
--
you
,
*NL*
for
instance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
was
profoundly
humbled
by
his
words
.
``
For
God
's
sake
,
''
I
said
,
``
do
n't
*NL*
set
me
up
,
my
dear
fellow
;
just
look
to
yourself
.
''
I
felt
a
gratitude
,
*NL*
an
affection
,
for
that
straggler
whose
eyes
had
singled
me
out
,
keeping
*NL*
my
place
in
the
ranks
of
an
insignificant
multitude
.
How
little
that
*NL*
was
to
boast
of
,
after
all
!
I
turned
my
burning
face
away
;
under
the
*NL*
low
sun
,
glowing
,
darkened
and
crimson
,
like
un
ember
snatched
from
the
*NL*
fire
,
the
sea
lay
outspread
,
offering
all
its
immense
stillness
to
the
*NL*
approach
of
the
fiery
orb
.
Twice
he
was
going
to
speak
,
but
checked
*NL*
himself
;
at
last
,
as
if
he
had
found
a
formula
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
shall
be
faithful
,
''
he
said
quietly
.
``
I
shall
be
faithful
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
without
looking
at
me
,
but
for
the
first
time
letting
his
eyes
*NL*
wander
upon
the
waters
,
whose
blueness
had
changed
to
a
gloomy
purple
*NL*
under
the
fires
of
sunset
.
Ah
!
he
was
romantic
,
romantic
.
I
recalled
*NL*
some
words
of
Stein
's
...
``
In
the
destructive
element
immerse
!
...
*NL*
To
follow
the
dream
,
and
again
to
follow
the
dream
--
and
*NL*
so
--
always
--
usque
ad
finem
...
''
He
was
romantic
,
but
none
the
*NL*
less
true
.
Who
could
tell
what
forms
,
what
visions
,
what
faces
,
what
*NL*
forgiveness
he
could
see
in
the
glow
of
the
west
!
...
A
small
boat
,
*NL*
leaving
the
schooner
,
moved
slowly
,
with
a
regular
beat
of
two
oars
,
*NL*
towards
the
sandbank
to
take
me
off
.
``
And
then
there
's
Jewel
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
out
of
the
great
silence
of
earth
,
sky
,
and
sea
,
which
had
mastered
my
*NL*
very
thoughts
so
that
his
voice
made
me
start
.
``
There
's
Jewel
.
''
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
I
murmured
.
``
I
need
not
tell
you
what
she
is
to
me
,
''
he
pursued
.
*NL*
``
You
've
seen
.
In
time
she
will
come
to
understand
...
''
``
I
hope
so
,
''
I
*NL*
interrupted
.
``
She
trusts
me
,
too
,
''
he
mused
,
and
then
changed
his
tone
.
*NL*
``
When
shall
we
meet
next
,
I
wonder
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Never
--
unless
you
come
out
,
''
I
answered
,
avoiding
his
glance
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
seem
to
be
surprised
;
he
kept
very
quiet
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Good-bye
,
then
,
''
he
said
,
after
a
pause
.
``
Perhaps
it
's
just
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
We
shook
hands
,
and
I
walked
to
the
boat
,
which
waited
with
her
nose
*NL*
on
the
beach
.
The
schooner
,
her
mainsail
set
and
jib-sheet
to
windward
,
*NL*
curveted
on
the
purple
sea
;
there
was
a
rosy
tinge
on
her
sails
.
``
Will
*NL*
you
be
going
home
again
soon
?
''
asked
Jim
,
just
as
I
swung
my
leg
over
*NL*
the
gunwale
.
``
In
a
year
or
so
if
I
live
,
''
I
said
.
The
forefoot
grated
on
*NL*
the
sand
,
the
boat
floated
,
the
wet
oars
flashed
and
dipped
once
,
twice
.
*NL*
Jim
,
at
the
water
's
edge
,
raised
his
voice
.
``
Tell
them
...
''
he
began
.
*NL*
I
signed
to
the
men
to
cease
rowing
,
and
waited
in
wonder
.
Tell
who
?
The
*NL*
half-submerged
sun
faced
him
;
I
could
see
its
red
gleam
in
his
eyes
that
*NL*
looked
dumbly
at
me
...
``
No
--
nothing
,
''
he
said
,
and
with
a
slight
*NL*
wave
of
his
hand
motioned
the
boat
away
.
I
did
not
look
again
at
the
*NL*
shore
till
I
had
clambered
on
board
the
schooner
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
By
that
time
the
sun
had
set
.
The
twilight
lay
over
the
east
,
and
the
*NL*
coast
,
turned
black
,
extended
infinitely
its
sombre
wall
that
seemed
the
*NL*
very
stronghold
of
the
night
;
the
western
horizon
was
one
great
blaze
of
*NL*
gold
and
crimson
in
which
a
big
detached
cloud
floated
dark
and
still
,
*NL*
casting
a
slaty
shadow
on
the
water
beneath
,
and
I
saw
Jim
on
the
beach
*NL*
watching
the
schooner
fall
off
and
gather
headway
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
two
half-naked
fishermen
had
arisen
as
soon
as
I
had
gone
;
they
*NL*
were
no
doubt
pouring
the
plaint
of
their
trifling
,
miserable
,
oppressed
*NL*
lives
into
the
ears
of
the
white
lord
,
and
no
doubt
he
was
listening
to
*NL*
it
,
making
it
his
own
,
for
was
it
not
a
part
of
his
luck
--
the
luck
``
from
*NL*
the
word
Go
''
--
the
luck
to
which
he
had
assured
me
he
was
so
completely
*NL*
equal
?
They
,
too
,
I
should
think
,
were
in
luck
,
and
I
was
sure
their
*NL*
pertinacity
would
be
equal
to
it
.
Their
dark-skinned
bodies
vanished
on
*NL*
the
dark
background
long
before
I
had
lost
sight
of
their
protector
.
He
*NL*
was
white
from
head
to
foot
,
and
remained
persistently
visible
with
*NL*
the
stronghold
of
the
night
at
his
back
,
the
sea
at
his
feet
,
the
*NL*
opportunity
by
his
side
--
still
veiled
.
What
do
you
say
?
Was
it
still
*NL*
veiled
?
I
do
n't
know
.
For
me
that
white
figure
in
the
stillness
of
coast
*NL*
and
sea
seemed
to
stand
at
the
heart
of
a
vast
enigma
.
The
twilight
*NL*
was
ebbing
fast
from
the
sky
above
his
head
,
the
strip
of
sand
had
sunk
*NL*
already
under
his
feet
,
he
himself
appeared
no
bigger
than
a
child
--
then
*NL*
only
a
speck
,
a
tiny
white
speck
,
that
seemed
to
catch
all
the
light
*NL*
left
in
a
darkened
world
...
And
,
suddenly
,
I
lost
him
...

CHAPTER
36
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
With
these
words
Marlow
had
ended
his
narrative
,
and
his
audience
had
*NL*
broken
up
forthwith
,
under
his
abstract
,
pensive
gaze
.
Men
drifted
off
*NL*
the
verandah
in
pairs
or
alone
without
loss
of
time
,
without
offering
*NL*
a
remark
,
as
if
the
last
image
of
that
incomplete
story
,
its
*NL*
incompleteness
itself
,
and
the
very
tone
of
the
speaker
,
had
made
*NL*
discussion
in
vain
and
comment
impossible
.
Each
of
them
seemed
to
carry
*NL*
away
his
own
impression
,
to
carry
it
away
with
him
like
a
secret
;
but
*NL*
there
was
only
one
man
of
all
these
listeners
who
was
ever
to
hear
the
*NL*
last
word
of
the
story
.
It
came
to
him
at
home
,
more
than
two
years
*NL*
later
,
and
it
came
contained
in
a
thick
packet
addressed
in
Marlow
's
*NL*
upright
and
angular
handwriting
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
privileged
man
opened
the
packet
,
looked
in
,
then
,
laying
it
down
,
*NL*
went
to
the
window
.
His
rooms
were
in
the
highest
flat
of
a
lofty
*NL*
building
,
and
his
glance
could
travel
afar
beyond
the
clear
panes
of
*NL*
glass
,
as
though
he
were
looking
out
of
the
lantern
of
a
lighthouse
.
*NL*
The
slopes
of
the
roofs
glistened
,
the
dark
broken
ridges
succeeded
each
*NL*
other
without
end
like
sombre
,
uncrested
waves
,
and
from
the
depths
of
*NL*
the
town
under
his
feet
ascended
a
confused
and
unceasing
mutter
.
The
*NL*
spires
of
churches
,
numerous
,
scattered
haphazard
,
uprose
like
beacons
*NL*
on
a
maze
of
shoals
without
a
channel
;
the
driving
rain
mingled
with
the
*NL*
falling
dusk
of
a
winter
's
evening
;
and
the
booming
of
a
big
clock
on
a
*NL*
tower
,
striking
the
hour
,
rolled
past
in
voluminous
,
austere
bursts
*NL*
of
sound
,
with
a
shrill
vibrating
cry
at
the
core
.
He
drew
the
heavy
*NL*
curtains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
of
his
shaded
reading-lamp
slept
like
a
sheltered
pool
,
his
*NL*
footfalls
made
no
sound
on
the
carpet
,
his
wandering
days
were
over
.
No
*NL*
more
horizons
as
boundless
as
hope
,
no
more
twilights
within
the
forests
*NL*
as
solemn
as
temples
,
in
the
hot
quest
for
the
Ever-undiscovered
*NL*
Country
over
the
hill
,
across
the
stream
,
beyond
the
wave
.
The
hour
*NL*
was
striking
!
No
more
!
No
more
!
--
but
the
opened
packet
under
the
lamp
*NL*
brought
back
the
sounds
,
the
visions
,
the
very
savour
of
the
past
--
a
*NL*
multitude
of
fading
faces
,
a
tumult
of
low
voices
,
dying
away
upon
the
*NL*
shores
of
distant
seas
under
a
passionate
and
unconsoling
sunshine
.
He
*NL*
sighed
and
sat
down
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
he
saw
three
distinct
enclosures
.
A
good
many
pages
closely
*NL*
blackened
and
pinned
together
;
a
loose
square
sheet
of
greyish
paper
*NL*
with
a
few
words
traced
in
a
handwriting
he
had
never
seen
before
,
and
*NL*
an
explanatory
letter
from
Marlow
.
From
this
last
fell
another
letter
,
*NL*
yellowed
by
time
and
frayed
on
the
folds
.
He
picked
it
up
and
,
laying
it
*NL*
aside
,
turned
to
Marlow
's
message
,
ran
swiftly
over
the
opening
lines
,
*NL*
and
,
checking
himself
,
thereafter
read
on
deliberately
,
like
one
*NL*
approaching
with
slow
feet
and
alert
eyes
the
glimpse
of
an
undiscovered
*NL*
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
...
I
do
n't
suppose
you
've
forgotten
,
'
went
on
the
letter
.
`
You
alone
*NL*
have
showed
an
interest
in
him
that
survived
the
telling
of
his
story
,
*NL*
though
I
remember
well
you
would
not
admit
he
had
mastered
his
fate
.
*NL*
You
prophesied
for
him
the
disaster
of
weariness
and
of
disgust
with
*NL*
acquired
honour
,
with
the
self-appointed
task
,
with
the
love
sprung
from
*NL*
pity
and
youth
.
You
had
said
you
knew
so
well
``
that
kind
of
thing
,
''
its
*NL*
illusory
satisfaction
,
its
unavoidable
deception
.
You
said
also
--
I
call
*NL*
to
mind
--
that
``
giving
your
life
up
to
them
''
-LRB-
them
meaning
all
of
mankind
*NL*
with
skins
brown
,
yellow
,
or
black
in
colour
-RRB-
``
was
like
selling
your
*NL*
soul
to
a
brute
.
''
You
contended
that
``
that
kind
of
thing
''
was
only
*NL*
endurable
and
enduring
when
based
on
a
firm
conviction
in
the
truth
of
*NL*
ideas
racially
our
own
,
in
whose
name
are
established
the
order
,
the
*NL*
morality
of
an
ethical
progress
.
``
We
want
its
strength
at
our
backs
,
''
*NL*
you
had
said
.
``
We
want
a
belief
in
its
necessity
and
its
justice
,
to
*NL*
make
a
worthy
and
conscious
sacrifice
of
our
lives
.
Without
it
the
*NL*
sacrifice
is
only
forgetfulness
,
the
way
of
offering
is
no
better
than
*NL*
the
way
to
perdition
.
''
In
other
words
,
you
maintained
that
we
must
fight
*NL*
in
the
ranks
or
our
lives
do
n't
count
.
Possibly
!
You
ought
to
know
--
be
*NL*
it
said
without
malice
--
you
who
have
rushed
into
one
or
two
places
*NL*
single-handed
and
came
out
cleverly
,
without
singeing
your
wings
.
The
*NL*
point
,
however
,
is
that
of
all
mankind
Jim
had
no
dealings
but
with
*NL*
himself
,
and
the
question
is
whether
at
the
last
he
had
not
confessed
to
*NL*
a
faith
mightier
than
the
laws
of
order
and
progress
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
affirm
nothing
.
Perhaps
you
may
pronounce
--
after
you
've
read
.
There
*NL*
is
much
truth
--
after
all
--
in
the
common
expression
``
under
a
cloud
.
''
It
*NL*
is
impossible
to
see
him
clearly
--
especially
as
it
is
through
the
eyes
*NL*
of
others
that
we
take
our
last
look
at
him
.
I
have
no
hesitation
in
*NL*
imparting
to
you
all
I
know
of
the
last
episode
that
,
as
he
used
to
say
,
*NL*
had
``
come
to
him
.
''
One
wonders
whether
this
was
perhaps
that
supreme
*NL*
opportunity
,
that
last
and
satisfying
test
for
which
I
had
always
*NL*
suspected
him
to
be
waiting
,
before
he
could
frame
a
message
to
the
*NL*
impeccable
world
.
You
remember
that
when
I
was
leaving
him
for
the
last
*NL*
time
he
had
asked
whether
I
would
be
going
home
soon
,
and
suddenly
cried
*NL*
after
me
,
``
Tell
them
...
''
I
had
waited
--
curious
I
'll
own
,
and
hopeful
*NL*
too
--
only
to
hear
him
shout
,
``
No
--
nothing
.
''
That
was
all
then
--
and
there
*NL*
will
be
nothing
more
;
there
will
be
no
message
,
unless
such
as
each
of
*NL*
us
can
interpret
for
himself
from
the
language
of
facts
,
that
are
so
*NL*
often
more
enigmatic
than
the
craftiest
arrangement
of
words
.
He
made
,
*NL*
it
is
true
,
one
more
attempt
to
deliver
himself
;
but
that
too
failed
,
as
*NL*
you
may
perceive
if
you
look
at
the
sheet
of
greyish
foolscap
enclosed
*NL*
here
.
He
had
tried
to
write
;
do
you
notice
the
commonplace
hand
?
It
is
*NL*
headed
``
The
Fort
,
Patusan
.
''
I
suppose
he
had
carried
out
his
intention
*NL*
of
making
out
of
his
house
a
place
of
defence
.
It
was
an
excellent
plan
:
*NL*
a
deep
ditch
,
an
earth
wall
topped
by
a
palisade
,
and
at
the
angles
*NL*
guns
mounted
on
platforms
to
sweep
each
side
of
the
square
.
Doramin
had
*NL*
agreed
to
furnish
him
the
guns
;
and
so
each
man
of
his
party
would
know
*NL*
there
was
a
place
of
safety
,
upon
which
every
faithful
partisan
could
*NL*
rally
in
case
of
some
sudden
danger
.
All
this
showed
his
judicious
*NL*
foresight
,
his
faith
in
the
future
.
What
he
called
``
my
own
people
''
--
the
*NL*
liberated
captives
of
the
Sherif
--
were
to
make
a
distinct
quarter
of
*NL*
Patusan
,
with
their
huts
and
little
plots
of
ground
under
the
walls
of
*NL*
the
stronghold
.
Within
he
would
be
an
invincible
host
in
himself
``
The
*NL*
Fort
,
Patusan
.
''
No
date
,
as
you
observe
.
What
is
a
number
and
a
name
to
*NL*
a
day
of
days
?
It
is
also
impossible
to
say
whom
he
had
in
his
mind
when
*NL*
he
seized
the
pen
:
Stein
--
myself
--
the
world
at
large
--
or
was
this
only
*NL*
the
aimless
startled
cry
of
a
solitary
man
confronted
by
his
fate
?
``
An
*NL*
awful
thing
has
happened
,
''
he
wrote
before
he
flung
the
pen
down
for
the
*NL*
first
time
;
look
at
the
ink
blot
resembling
the
head
of
an
arrow
under
*NL*
these
words
.
After
a
while
he
had
tried
again
,
scrawling
heavily
,
as
if
*NL*
with
a
hand
of
lead
,
another
line
.
``
I
must
now
at
once
...
''
The
pen
*NL*
had
spluttered
,
and
that
time
he
gave
it
up
.
There
's
nothing
more
;
*NL*
he
had
seen
a
broad
gulf
that
neither
eye
nor
voice
could
span
.
I
*NL*
can
understand
this
.
He
was
overwhelmed
by
the
inexplicable
;
he
was
*NL*
overwhelmed
by
his
own
personality
--
the
gift
of
that
destiny
which
he
*NL*
had
done
his
best
to
master
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
send
you
also
an
old
letter
--
a
very
old
letter
.
It
was
found
*NL*
carefully
preserved
in
his
writing-case
.
It
is
from
his
father
,
and
*NL*
by
the
date
you
can
see
he
must
have
received
it
a
few
days
before
he
*NL*
joined
the
Patna
.
Thus
it
must
be
the
last
letter
he
ever
had
from
home
.
*NL*
He
had
treasured
it
all
these
years
.
The
good
old
parson
fancied
his
*NL*
sailor
son
.
I
've
looked
in
at
a
sentence
here
and
there
.
There
is
*NL*
nothing
in
it
except
just
affection
.
He
tells
his
``
dear
James
''
that
the
*NL*
last
long
letter
from
him
was
very
``
honest
and
entertaining
.
''
He
would
*NL*
not
have
him
``
judge
men
harshly
or
hastily
.
''
There
are
four
pages
of
it
,
*NL*
easy
morality
and
family
news
.
Tom
had
``
taken
orders
.
''
Carrie
's
husband
*NL*
had
``
money
losses
.
''
The
old
chap
goes
on
equably
trusting
Providence
and
*NL*
the
established
order
of
the
universe
,
but
alive
to
its
small
dangers
*NL*
and
its
small
mercies
.
One
can
almost
see
him
,
grey-haired
and
serene
in
*NL*
the
inviolable
shelter
of
his
book-lined
,
faded
,
and
comfortable
study
,
*NL*
where
for
forty
years
he
had
conscientiously
gone
over
and
over
again
*NL*
the
round
of
his
little
thoughts
about
faith
and
virtue
,
about
the
*NL*
conduct
of
life
and
the
only
proper
manner
of
dying
;
where
he
had
*NL*
written
so
many
sermons
,
where
he
sits
talking
to
his
boy
,
over
there
,
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
earth
.
But
what
of
the
distance
?
Virtue
is
one
*NL*
all
over
the
world
,
and
there
is
only
one
faith
,
one
conceivable
conduct
*NL*
of
life
,
one
manner
of
dying
.
He
hopes
his
``
dear
James
''
will
never
*NL*
forget
that
``
who
once
gives
way
to
temptation
,
in
the
very
instant
*NL*
hazards
his
total
depravity
and
everlasting
ruin
.
Therefore
resolve
*NL*
fixedly
never
,
through
any
possible
motives
,
to
do
anything
which
you
*NL*
believe
to
be
wrong
.
''
There
is
also
some
news
of
a
favourite
dog
;
and
a
*NL*
pony
,
``
which
all
you
boys
used
to
ride
,
''
had
gone
blind
from
old
age
and
*NL*
had
to
be
shot
.
The
old
chap
invokes
Heaven
's
blessing
;
the
mother
and
*NL*
all
the
girls
then
at
home
send
their
love
...
No
,
there
is
nothing
*NL*
much
in
that
yellow
frayed
letter
fluttering
out
of
his
cherishing
*NL*
grasp
after
so
many
years
.
It
was
never
answered
,
but
who
can
say
what
*NL*
converse
he
may
have
held
with
all
these
placid
,
colourless
forms
of
men
*NL*
and
women
peopling
that
quiet
corner
of
the
world
as
free
of
danger
*NL*
or
strife
as
a
tomb
,
and
breathing
equably
the
air
of
undisturbed
*NL*
rectitude
.
It
seems
amazing
that
he
should
belong
to
it
,
he
to
whom
so
*NL*
many
things
``
had
come
.
''
Nothing
ever
came
to
them
;
they
would
never
be
*NL*
taken
unawares
,
and
never
be
called
upon
to
grapple
with
fate
.
Here
they
*NL*
all
are
,
evoked
by
the
mild
gossip
of
the
father
,
all
these
brothers
*NL*
and
sisters
,
bone
of
his
bone
and
flesh
of
his
flesh
,
gazing
with
clear
*NL*
unconscious
eyes
,
while
I
seem
to
see
him
,
returned
at
last
,
no
longer
*NL*
a
mere
white
speck
at
the
heart
of
an
immense
mystery
,
but
of
full
*NL*
stature
,
standing
disregarded
amongst
their
untroubled
shapes
,
with
a
*NL*
stern
and
romantic
aspect
,
but
always
mute
,
dark
--
under
a
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
story
of
the
last
events
you
will
find
in
the
few
pages
enclosed
*NL*
here
.
You
must
admit
that
it
is
romantic
beyond
the
wildest
dreams
*NL*
of
his
boyhood
,
and
yet
there
is
to
my
mind
a
sort
of
profound
and
*NL*
terrifying
logic
in
it
,
as
if
it
were
our
imagination
alone
that
could
*NL*
set
loose
upon
us
the
might
of
an
overwhelming
destiny
.
The
imprudence
*NL*
of
our
thoughts
recoils
upon
our
heads
;
who
toys
with
the
sword
shall
*NL*
perish
by
the
sword
.
This
astounding
adventure
,
of
which
the
most
*NL*
astounding
part
is
that
it
is
true
,
comes
on
as
an
unavoidable
*NL*
consequence
.
Something
of
the
sort
had
to
happen
.
You
repeat
this
to
*NL*
yourself
while
you
marvel
that
such
a
thing
could
happen
in
the
year
of
*NL*
grace
before
last
.
But
it
has
happened
--
and
there
is
no
disputing
its
*NL*
logic
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
put
it
down
here
for
you
as
though
I
had
been
an
eyewitness
.
My
*NL*
information
was
fragmentary
,
but
I
've
fitted
the
pieces
together
,
and
*NL*
there
is
enough
of
them
to
make
an
intelligible
picture
.
I
wonder
how
*NL*
he
would
have
related
it
himself
.
He
has
confided
so
much
in
me
that
at
*NL*
times
it
seems
as
though
he
must
come
in
presently
and
tell
the
story
*NL*
in
his
own
words
,
in
his
careless
yet
feeling
voice
,
with
his
offhand
*NL*
manner
,
a
little
puzzled
,
a
little
bothered
,
a
little
hurt
,
but
now
and
*NL*
then
by
a
word
or
a
phrase
giving
one
of
these
glimpses
of
his
very
*NL*
own
self
that
were
never
any
good
for
purposes
of
orientation
.
It
's
*NL*
difficult
to
believe
he
will
never
come
.
I
shall
never
hear
his
voice
*NL*
again
,
nor
shall
I
see
his
smooth
tan-and-pink
face
with
a
white
line
*NL*
on
the
forehead
,
and
the
youthful
eyes
darkened
by
excitement
to
a
*NL*
profound
,
unfathomable
blue
.

CHAPTER
37
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
all
begins
with
a
remarkable
exploit
of
a
man
called
Brown
,
who
*NL*
stole
with
complete
success
a
Spanish
schooner
out
of
a
small
bay
near
*NL*
Zamboanga
.
Till
I
discovered
the
fellow
my
information
was
incomplete
,
*NL*
but
most
unexpectedly
I
did
come
upon
him
a
few
hours
before
he
gave
up
*NL*
his
arrogant
ghost
.
Fortunately
he
was
willing
and
able
to
talk
between
*NL*
the
choking
fits
of
asthma
,
and
his
racked
body
writhed
with
malicious
*NL*
exultation
at
the
bare
thought
of
Jim
.
He
exulted
thus
at
the
idea
that
*NL*
he
had
``
paid
out
the
stuck-up
beggar
after
all
.
''
He
gloated
over
his
*NL*
action
.
I
had
to
bear
the
sunken
glare
of
his
fierce
crow-footed
eyes
if
*NL*
I
wanted
to
know
;
and
so
I
bore
it
,
reflecting
how
much
certain
forms
*NL*
of
evil
are
akin
to
madness
,
derived
from
intense
egoism
,
inflamed
by
*NL*
resistance
,
tearing
the
soul
to
pieces
,
and
giving
factitious
vigour
to
*NL*
the
body
.
The
story
also
reveals
unsuspected
depths
of
cunning
in
the
*NL*
wretched
Cornelius
,
whose
abject
and
intense
hate
acts
like
a
subtle
*NL*
inspiration
,
pointing
out
an
unerring
way
towards
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
I
could
see
directly
I
set
my
eyes
on
him
what
sort
of
a
fool
he
was
,
''
*NL*
gasped
the
dying
Brown
.
``
He
a
man
!
Hell
!
He
was
a
hollow
sham
.
As
if
he
*NL*
could
n't
have
said
straight
out
,
`
Hands
off
my
plunder
!
'
blast
him
!
That
*NL*
would
have
been
like
a
man
!
Rot
his
superior
soul
!
He
had
me
there
--
but
*NL*
he
had
n't
devil
enough
in
him
to
make
an
end
of
me
.
Not
he
!
A
thing
like
*NL*
that
letting
me
off
as
if
I
was
n't
worth
a
kick
!
...
''
Brown
struggled
*NL*
desperately
for
breath
...
``
Fraud
...
Letting
me
off
...
And
*NL*
so
I
did
make
an
end
of
him
after
all
...
''
He
choked
again
...
``
I
*NL*
expect
this
thing
'll
kill
me
,
but
I
shall
die
easy
now
.
You
...
you
*NL*
here
...
I
do
n't
know
your
name
--
I
would
give
you
a
five-pound
note
*NL*
if
--
if
I
had
it
--
for
the
news
--
or
my
name
's
not
Brown
...
''
He
grinned
*NL*
horribly
...
``
Gentleman
Brown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
said
all
these
things
in
profound
gasps
,
staring
at
me
with
his
*NL*
yellow
eyes
out
of
a
long
,
ravaged
,
brown
face
;
he
jerked
his
left
arm
;
*NL*
a
pepper-and-salt
matted
beard
hung
almost
into
his
lap
;
a
dirty
ragged
*NL*
blanket
covered
his
legs
.
I
had
found
him
out
in
Bankok
through
that
*NL*
busybody
Schomberg
,
the
hotel-keeper
,
who
had
,
confidentially
,
directed
*NL*
me
where
to
look
.
It
appears
that
a
sort
of
loafing
,
fuddled
vagabond
--
a
*NL*
white
man
living
amongst
the
natives
with
a
Siamese
woman
--
had
*NL*
considered
it
a
great
privilege
to
give
a
shelter
to
the
last
days
of
*NL*
the
famous
Gentleman
Brown
.
While
he
was
talking
to
me
in
the
wretched
*NL*
hovel
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
fighting
for
every
minute
of
his
life
,
the
*NL*
Siamese
woman
,
with
big
bare
legs
and
a
stupid
coarse
face
,
sat
in
a
*NL*
dark
corner
chewing
betel
stolidly
.
Now
and
then
she
would
get
up
for
*NL*
the
purpose
of
shooing
a
chicken
away
from
the
door
.
The
whole
hut
shook
*NL*
when
she
walked
.
An
ugly
yellow
child
,
naked
and
pot-bellied
like
a
*NL*
little
heathen
god
,
stood
at
the
foot
of
the
couch
,
finger
in
mouth
,
*NL*
lost
in
a
profound
and
calm
contemplation
of
the
dying
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
talked
feverishly
;
but
in
the
middle
of
a
word
,
perhaps
,
an
*NL*
invisible
hand
would
take
him
by
the
throat
,
and
he
would
look
at
me
*NL*
dumbly
with
an
expression
of
doubt
and
anguish
.
He
seemed
to
fear
that
*NL*
I
would
get
tired
of
waiting
and
go
away
,
leaving
him
with
his
tale
*NL*
untold
,
with
his
exultation
unexpressed
.
He
died
during
the
night
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
but
by
that
time
I
had
nothing
more
to
learn
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
So
much
as
to
Brown
,
for
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Eight
months
before
this
,
coming
into
Samarang
,
I
went
as
usual
to
see
*NL*
Stein
.
On
the
garden
side
of
the
house
a
Malay
on
the
verandah
greeted
*NL*
me
shyly
,
and
I
remembered
that
I
had
seen
him
in
Patusan
,
in
Jim
's
*NL*
house
,
amongst
other
Bugis
men
who
used
to
come
in
the
evening
to
talk
*NL*
interminably
over
their
war
reminiscences
and
to
discuss
State
affairs
.
*NL*
Jim
had
pointed
him
out
to
me
once
as
a
respectable
petty
trader
owning
*NL*
a
small
seagoing
native
craft
,
who
had
showed
himself
``
one
of
the
best
*NL*
at
the
taking
of
the
stockade
.
''
I
was
not
very
surprised
to
see
him
,
*NL*
since
any
Patusan
trader
venturing
as
far
as
Samarang
would
naturally
*NL*
find
his
way
to
Stein
's
house
.
I
returned
his
greeting
and
passed
on
.
At
*NL*
the
door
of
Stein
's
room
I
came
upon
another
Malay
in
whom
I
recognised
*NL*
Tamb
'
Itam
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
asked
him
at
once
what
he
was
doing
there
;
it
occurred
to
me
that
*NL*
Jim
might
have
come
on
a
visit
.
I
own
I
was
pleased
and
excited
at
the
*NL*
thought
.
Tamb
'
Itam
looked
as
if
he
did
not
know
what
to
say
.
``
Is
Tuan
*NL*
Jim
inside
?
''
I
asked
impatiently
.
``
No
,
''
he
mumbled
,
hanging
his
head
*NL*
for
a
moment
,
and
then
with
sudden
earnestness
,
``
He
would
not
fight
.
He
*NL*
would
not
fight
,
''
he
repeated
twice
.
As
he
seemed
unable
to
say
anything
*NL*
else
,
I
pushed
him
aside
and
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stein
,
tall
and
stooping
,
stood
alone
in
the
middle
of
the
room
between
*NL*
the
rows
of
butterfly
cases
.
``
Ach
!
is
it
you
,
my
friend
?
''
he
said
*NL*
sadly
,
peering
through
his
glasses
.
A
drab
sack-coat
of
alpaca
hung
,
*NL*
unbuttoned
,
down
to
his
knees
.
He
had
a
Panama
hat
on
his
head
,
and
*NL*
there
were
deep
furrows
on
his
pale
cheeks
.
``
What
's
the
matter
now
?
''
*NL*
I
asked
nervously
.
``
There
's
Tamb
'
Itam
there
...
''
``
Come
and
see
the
*NL*
girl
.
Come
and
see
the
girl
.
She
is
here
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
half-hearted
*NL*
show
of
activity
.
I
tried
to
detain
him
,
but
with
gentle
obstinacy
he
*NL*
would
take
no
notice
of
my
eager
questions
.
``
She
is
here
,
she
is
here
,
''
*NL*
he
repeated
,
in
great
perturbation
.
``
They
came
here
two
days
ago
.
An
old
*NL*
man
like
me
,
a
stranger
--
sehen
Sie
--
can
not
do
much
...
Come
this
way
.
*NL*
...
Young
hearts
are
unforgiving
...
''
I
could
see
he
was
in
utmost
*NL*
distress
...
``
The
strength
of
life
in
them
,
the
cruel
strength
of
*NL*
life
...
''
He
mumbled
,
leading
me
round
the
house
;
I
followed
him
,
*NL*
lost
in
dismal
and
angry
conjectures
.
At
the
door
of
the
drawing-room
he
*NL*
barred
my
way
.
``
He
loved
her
very
much
,
''
he
said
interrogatively
,
and
*NL*
I
only
nodded
,
feeling
so
bitterly
disappointed
that
I
would
not
trust
*NL*
myself
to
speak
.
``
Very
frightful
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
She
ca
n't
understand
*NL*
me
.
I
am
only
a
strange
old
man
.
Perhaps
you
...
she
knows
you
.
Talk
*NL*
to
her
.
We
ca
n't
leave
it
like
this
.
Tell
her
to
forgive
him
.
It
was
*NL*
very
frightful
.
''
``
No
doubt
,
''
I
said
,
exasperated
at
being
in
the
dark
;
*NL*
``
but
have
you
forgiven
him
?
''
He
looked
at
me
queerly
.
``
You
shall
hear
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
and
opening
the
door
,
absolutely
pushed
me
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
You
know
Stein
's
big
house
and
the
two
immense
reception-rooms
,
*NL*
uninhabited
and
uninhabitable
,
clean
,
full
of
solitude
and
of
shining
*NL*
things
that
look
as
if
never
beheld
by
the
eye
of
man
?
They
are
cool
*NL*
on
the
hottest
days
,
and
you
enter
them
as
you
would
a
scrubbed
cave
*NL*
underground
.
I
passed
through
one
,
and
in
the
other
I
saw
the
girl
*NL*
sitting
at
the
end
of
a
big
mahogany
table
,
on
which
she
rested
her
*NL*
head
,
the
face
hidden
in
her
arms
.
The
waxed
floor
reflected
her
dimly
*NL*
as
though
it
had
been
a
sheet
of
frozen
water
.
The
rattan
screens
were
*NL*
down
,
and
through
the
strange
greenish
gloom
made
by
the
foliage
of
the
*NL*
trees
outside
a
strong
wind
blew
in
gusts
,
swaying
the
long
draperies
*NL*
of
windows
and
doorways
.
Her
white
figure
seemed
shaped
in
snow
;
the
*NL*
pendent
crystals
of
a
great
chandelier
clicked
above
her
head
like
*NL*
glittering
icicles
.
She
looked
up
and
watched
my
approach
.
I
was
chilled
*NL*
as
if
these
vast
apartments
had
been
the
cold
abode
of
despair
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
recognised
me
at
once
,
and
as
soon
as
I
had
stopped
,
looking
down
*NL*
at
her
:
``
He
has
left
me
,
''
she
said
quietly
;
``
you
always
leave
us
--
for
*NL*
your
own
ends
.
''
Her
face
was
set
.
All
the
heat
of
life
seemed
withdrawn
*NL*
within
some
inaccessible
spot
in
her
breast
.
``
It
would
have
been
easy
to
*NL*
die
with
him
,
''
she
went
on
,
and
made
a
slight
weary
gesture
as
if
giving
*NL*
up
the
incomprehensible
.
``
He
would
not
!
It
was
like
a
blindness
--
and
yet
*NL*
it
was
I
who
was
speaking
to
him
;
it
was
I
who
stood
before
his
eyes
;
*NL*
it
was
at
me
that
he
looked
all
the
time
!
Ah
!
you
are
hard
,
treacherous
,
*NL*
without
truth
,
without
compassion
.
What
makes
you
so
wicked
?
Or
is
it
*NL*
that
you
are
all
mad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
took
her
hand
;
it
did
not
respond
,
and
when
I
dropped
it
,
it
hung
*NL*
down
to
the
floor
.
That
indifference
,
more
awful
than
tears
,
cries
,
and
*NL*
reproaches
,
seemed
to
defy
time
and
consolation
.
You
felt
that
nothing
*NL*
you
could
say
would
reach
the
seat
of
the
still
and
benumbing
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Stein
had
said
,
``
You
shall
hear
.
''
I
did
hear
.
I
heard
it
all
,
listening
*NL*
with
amazement
,
with
awe
,
to
the
tones
of
her
inflexible
weariness
.
*NL*
She
could
not
grasp
the
real
sense
of
what
she
was
telling
me
,
and
her
*NL*
resentment
filled
me
with
pity
for
her
--
for
him
too
.
I
stood
rooted
to
*NL*
the
spot
after
she
had
finished
.
Leaning
on
her
arm
,
she
stared
with
*NL*
hard
eyes
,
and
the
wind
passed
in
gusts
,
the
crystals
kept
on
clicking
*NL*
in
the
greenish
gloom
.
She
went
on
whispering
to
herself
:
``
And
yet
he
*NL*
was
looking
at
me
!
He
could
see
my
face
,
hear
my
voice
,
hear
my
grief
!
*NL*
When
I
used
to
sit
at
his
feet
,
with
my
cheek
against
his
knee
and
his
*NL*
hand
on
my
head
,
the
curse
of
cruelty
and
madness
was
already
within
*NL*
him
,
waiting
for
the
day
.
The
day
came
!
...
and
before
the
sun
had
*NL*
set
he
could
not
see
me
any
more
--
he
was
made
blind
and
deaf
and
without
*NL*
pity
,
as
you
all
are
.
He
shall
have
no
tears
from
me
.
Never
,
never
.
Not
*NL*
one
tear
.
I
will
not
!
He
went
away
from
me
as
if
I
had
been
worse
than
*NL*
death
.
He
fled
as
if
driven
by
some
accursed
thing
he
had
heard
or
seen
*NL*
in
his
sleep
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Her
steady
eyes
seemed
to
strain
after
the
shape
of
a
man
torn
out
of
*NL*
her
arms
by
the
strength
of
a
dream
.
She
made
no
sign
to
my
silent
bow
.
*NL*
I
was
glad
to
escape
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
saw
her
once
again
,
the
same
afternoon
.
On
leaving
her
I
had
gone
*NL*
in
search
of
Stein
,
whom
I
could
not
find
indoors
;
and
I
wandered
out
,
*NL*
pursued
by
distressful
thoughts
,
into
the
gardens
,
those
famous
gardens
*NL*
of
Stein
,
in
which
you
can
find
every
plant
and
tree
of
tropical
*NL*
lowlands
.
I
followed
the
course
of
the
canalised
stream
,
and
sat
for
*NL*
a
long
time
on
a
shaded
bench
near
the
ornamental
pond
,
where
some
*NL*
waterfowl
with
clipped
wings
were
diving
and
splashing
noisily
.
The
*NL*
branches
of
casuarina
trees
behind
me
swayed
lightly
,
incessantly
,
*NL*
reminding
me
of
the
soughing
of
fir
trees
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
mournful
and
restless
sound
was
a
fit
accompaniment
to
my
*NL*
meditations
.
She
had
said
he
had
been
driven
away
from
her
by
a
*NL*
dream
,
--
and
there
was
no
answer
one
could
make
her
--
there
seemed
to
be
*NL*
no
forgiveness
for
such
a
transgression
.
And
yet
is
not
mankind
itself
,
*NL*
pushing
on
its
blind
way
,
driven
by
a
dream
of
its
greatness
and
*NL*
its
power
upon
the
dark
paths
of
excessive
cruelty
and
of
excessive
*NL*
devotion
?
And
what
is
the
pursuit
of
truth
,
after
all
?
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
I
rose
to
get
back
to
the
house
I
caught
sight
of
Stein
's
drab
*NL*
coat
through
a
gap
in
the
foliage
,
and
very
soon
at
a
turn
of
the
path
*NL*
I
came
upon
him
walking
with
the
girl
.
Her
little
hand
rested
on
his
*NL*
forearm
,
and
under
the
broad
,
flat
rim
of
his
Panama
hat
he
bent
over
*NL*
her
,
grey-haired
,
paternal
,
with
compassionate
and
chivalrous
deference
.
*NL*
I
stood
aside
,
but
they
stopped
,
facing
me
.
His
gaze
was
bent
on
the
*NL*
ground
at
his
feet
;
the
girl
,
erect
and
slight
on
his
arm
,
stared
*NL*
sombrely
beyond
my
shoulder
with
black
,
clear
,
motionless
eyes
.
*NL*
``
Schrecklich
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
Terrible
!
Terrible
!
What
can
one
do
?
''
He
*NL*
seemed
to
be
appealing
to
me
,
but
her
youth
,
the
length
of
the
days
*NL*
suspended
over
her
head
,
appealed
to
me
more
;
and
suddenly
,
even
as
I
*NL*
realised
that
nothing
could
be
said
,
I
found
myself
pleading
his
cause
*NL*
for
her
sake
.
``
You
must
forgive
him
,
''
I
concluded
,
and
my
own
voice
*NL*
seemed
to
me
muffled
,
lost
in
un
irresponsive
deaf
immensity
.
``
We
all
*NL*
want
to
be
forgiven
,
''
I
added
after
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
have
I
done
?
''
she
asked
with
her
lips
only
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
You
always
mistrusted
him
,
''
I
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
was
like
the
others
,
''
she
pronounced
slowly
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Not
like
the
others
,
''
I
protested
,
but
she
continued
evenly
,
without
*NL*
any
feeling
--
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
was
false
.
''
And
suddenly
Stein
broke
in
.
``
No
!
no
!
no
!
My
poor
*NL*
child
!
...
''
He
patted
her
hand
lying
passively
on
his
sleeve
.
``
No
!
no
!
*NL*
Not
false
!
True
!
True
!
True
!
''
He
tried
to
look
into
her
stony
face
.
``
You
*NL*
do
n't
understand
.
Ach
!
Why
you
do
not
understand
?
...
Terrible
,
''
he
*NL*
said
to
me
.
``
Some
day
she
_
shall
_
understand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Will
you
explain
?
''
I
asked
,
looking
hard
at
him
.
They
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
watched
them
.
Her
gown
trailed
on
the
path
,
her
black
hair
fell
*NL*
loose
.
She
walked
upright
and
light
by
the
side
of
the
tall
man
,
whose
*NL*
long
shapeless
coat
hung
in
perpendicular
folds
from
the
stooping
*NL*
shoulders
,
whose
feet
moved
slowly
.
They
disappeared
beyond
that
*NL*
spinney
-LRB-
you
may
remember
-RRB-
where
sixteen
different
kinds
of
bamboo
grow
*NL*
together
,
all
distinguishable
to
the
learned
eye
.
For
my
part
,
I
was
*NL*
fascinated
by
the
exquisite
grace
and
beauty
of
that
fluted
grove
,
*NL*
crowned
with
pointed
leaves
and
feathery
heads
,
the
lightness
,
the
*NL*
vigour
,
the
charm
as
distinct
as
a
voice
of
that
unperplexed
luxuriating
*NL*
life
.
I
remember
staying
to
look
at
it
for
a
long
time
,
as
one
would
*NL*
linger
within
reach
of
a
consoling
whisper
.
The
sky
was
pearly
grey
.
It
*NL*
was
one
of
those
overcast
days
so
rare
in
the
tropics
,
in
which
memories
*NL*
crowd
upon
one
,
memories
of
other
shores
,
of
other
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
drove
back
to
town
the
same
afternoon
,
taking
with
me
Tamb
'
Itam
*NL*
and
the
other
Malay
,
in
whose
seagoing
craft
they
had
escaped
in
the
*NL*
bewilderment
,
fear
,
and
gloom
of
the
disaster
.
The
shock
of
it
seemed
to
*NL*
have
changed
their
natures
.
It
had
turned
her
passion
into
stone
,
and
*NL*
it
made
the
surly
taciturn
Tamb
'
Itam
almost
loquacious
.
His
surliness
,
*NL*
too
,
was
subdued
into
puzzled
humility
,
as
though
he
had
seen
the
*NL*
failure
of
a
potent
charm
in
a
supreme
moment
.
The
Bugis
trader
,
a
shy
*NL*
hesitating
man
,
was
very
clear
in
the
little
he
had
to
say
.
Both
were
*NL*
evidently
over-awed
by
a
sense
of
deep
inexpressible
wonder
,
by
the
*NL*
touch
of
an
inscrutable
mystery
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
There
with
Marlow
's
signature
the
letter
proper
ended
.
The
privileged
*NL*
reader
screwed
up
his
lamp
,
and
solitary
above
the
billowy
roofs
of
the
*NL*
town
,
like
a
lighthouse-keeper
above
the
sea
,
he
turned
to
the
pages
of
*NL*
the
story
.

CHAPTER
38
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
all
begins
,
as
I
've
told
you
,
with
the
man
called
Brown
,
'
ran
the
*NL*
opening
sentence
of
Marlow
's
narrative
.
`
You
who
have
knocked
about
the
*NL*
Western
Pacific
must
have
heard
of
him
.
He
was
the
show
ruffian
on
the
*NL*
Australian
coast
--
not
that
he
was
often
to
be
seen
there
,
but
because
*NL*
he
was
always
trotted
out
in
the
stories
of
lawless
life
a
visitor
from
*NL*
home
is
treated
to
;
and
the
mildest
of
these
stories
which
were
told
*NL*
about
him
from
Cape
York
to
Eden
Bay
was
more
than
enough
to
hang
a
man
*NL*
if
told
in
the
right
place
.
They
never
failed
to
let
you
know
,
too
,
*NL*
that
he
was
supposed
to
be
the
son
of
a
baronet
.
Be
it
as
it
may
,
it
is
*NL*
certain
he
had
deserted
from
a
home
ship
in
the
early
gold-digging
days
,
*NL*
and
in
a
few
years
became
talked
about
as
the
terror
of
this
or
that
*NL*
group
of
islands
in
Polynesia
.
He
would
kidnap
natives
,
he
would
strip
*NL*
some
lonely
white
trader
to
the
very
pyjamas
he
stood
in
,
and
after
he
*NL*
had
robbed
the
poor
devil
,
he
would
as
likely
as
not
invite
him
to
fight
*NL*
a
duel
with
shot-guns
on
the
beach
--
which
would
have
been
fair
enough
*NL*
as
these
things
go
,
if
the
other
man
had
n't
been
by
that
time
already
*NL*
half-dead
with
fright
.
Brown
was
a
latter-day
buccaneer
,
sorry
enough
,
*NL*
like
his
more
celebrated
prototypes
;
but
what
distinguished
him
from
*NL*
his
contemporary
brother
ruffians
,
like
Bully
Hayes
or
the
mellifluous
*NL*
Pease
,
or
that
perfumed
,
Dundreary-whiskered
,
dandified
scoundrel
known
*NL*
as
Dirty
Dick
,
was
the
arrogant
temper
of
his
misdeeds
and
a
vehement
*NL*
scorn
for
mankind
at
large
and
for
his
victims
in
particular
.
The
*NL*
others
were
merely
vulgar
and
greedy
brutes
,
but
he
seemed
moved
by
some
*NL*
complex
intention
.
He
would
rob
a
man
as
if
only
to
demonstrate
his
poor
*NL*
opinion
of
the
creature
,
and
he
would
bring
to
the
shooting
or
maiming
*NL*
of
some
quiet
,
unoffending
stranger
a
savage
and
vengeful
earnestness
*NL*
fit
to
terrify
the
most
reckless
of
desperadoes
.
In
the
days
of
his
*NL*
greatest
glory
he
owned
an
armed
barque
,
manned
by
a
mixed
crew
of
*NL*
Kanakas
and
runaway
whalers
,
and
boasted
,
I
do
n't
know
with
what
truth
,
*NL*
of
being
financed
on
the
quiet
by
a
most
respectable
firm
of
copra
*NL*
merchants
.
Later
on
he
ran
off
--
it
was
reported
--
with
the
wife
of
a
*NL*
missionary
,
a
very
young
girl
from
Clapham
way
,
who
had
married
the
*NL*
mild
,
flat-footed
fellow
in
a
moment
of
enthusiasm
,
and
,
suddenly
*NL*
transplanted
to
Melanesia
,
lost
her
bearings
somehow
.
It
was
a
dark
*NL*
story
.
She
was
ill
at
the
time
he
carried
her
off
,
and
died
on
board
his
*NL*
ship
.
It
is
said
--
as
the
most
wonderful
put
of
the
tale
--
that
over
her
*NL*
body
he
gave
way
to
an
outburst
of
sombre
and
violent
grief
.
His
luck
*NL*
left
him
,
too
,
very
soon
after
.
He
lost
his
ship
on
some
rocks
off
*NL*
Malaita
,
and
disappeared
for
a
time
as
though
he
had
gone
down
with
her
.
*NL*
He
is
heard
of
next
at
Nuka-Hiva
,
where
he
bought
an
old
French
schooner
*NL*
out
of
Government
service
.
What
creditable
enterprise
he
might
have
had
*NL*
in
view
when
he
made
that
purchase
I
ca
n't
say
,
but
it
is
evident
that
*NL*
what
with
High
Commissioners
,
consuls
,
men-of-war
,
and
international
*NL*
control
,
the
South
Seas
were
getting
too
hot
to
hold
gentlemen
of
his
*NL*
kidney
.
Clearly
he
must
have
shifted
the
scene
of
his
operations
farther
*NL*
west
,
because
a
year
later
he
plays
an
incredibly
audacious
,
but
not
a
*NL*
very
profitable
part
,
in
a
serio-comic
business
in
Manila
Bay
,
in
which
*NL*
a
peculating
governor
and
an
absconding
treasurer
are
the
principal
*NL*
figures
;
thereafter
he
seems
to
have
hung
around
the
Philippines
in
his
*NL*
rotten
schooner
battling
with
un
adverse
fortune
,
till
at
last
,
running
*NL*
his
appointed
course
,
he
sails
into
Jim
's
history
,
a
blind
accomplice
of
*NL*
the
Dark
Powers
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
tale
goes
that
when
a
Spanish
patrol
cutter
captured
him
he
was
*NL*
simply
trying
to
run
a
few
guns
for
the
insurgents
.
If
so
,
then
I
ca
n't
*NL*
understand
what
he
was
doing
off
the
south
coast
of
Mindanao
.
My
belief
,
*NL*
however
,
is
that
he
was
blackmailing
the
native
villages
along
the
*NL*
coast
.
The
principal
thing
is
that
the
cutter
,
throwing
a
guard
on
*NL*
board
,
made
him
sail
in
company
towards
Zamboanga
.
On
the
way
,
for
some
*NL*
reason
or
other
,
both
vessels
had
to
call
at
one
of
these
new
Spanish
*NL*
settlements
--
which
never
came
to
anything
in
the
end
--
where
there
was
*NL*
not
only
a
civil
official
in
charge
on
shore
,
but
a
good
stout
coasting
*NL*
schooner
lying
at
anchor
in
the
little
bay
;
and
this
craft
,
in
every
way
*NL*
much
better
than
his
own
,
Brown
made
up
his
mind
to
steal
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
was
down
on
his
luck
--
as
he
told
me
himself
.
The
world
he
had
*NL*
bullied
for
twenty
years
with
fierce
,
aggressive
disdain
,
had
yielded
*NL*
him
nothing
in
the
way
of
material
advantage
except
a
small
bag
of
*NL*
silver
dollars
,
which
was
concealed
in
his
cabin
so
that
``
the
devil
*NL*
himself
could
n't
smell
it
out
.
''
And
that
was
all
--
absolutely
all
.
He
*NL*
was
tired
of
his
life
,
and
not
afraid
of
death
.
But
this
man
,
who
would
*NL*
stake
his
existence
on
a
whim
with
a
bitter
and
jeering
recklessness
,
*NL*
stood
in
mortal
fear
of
imprisonment
.
He
had
an
unreasoning
cold-sweat
,
*NL*
nerve-shaking
,
blood-to-water-turning
sort
of
horror
at
the
bare
*NL*
possibility
of
being
locked
up
--
the
sort
of
terror
a
superstitious
man
*NL*
would
feel
at
the
thought
of
being
embraced
by
a
spectre
.
Therefore
the
*NL*
civil
official
who
came
on
board
to
make
a
preliminary
investigation
*NL*
into
the
capture
,
investigated
arduously
all
day
long
,
and
only
went
*NL*
ashore
after
dark
,
muffled
up
in
a
cloak
,
and
taking
great
care
not
to
*NL*
let
Brown
's
little
all
clink
in
its
bag
.
Afterwards
,
being
a
man
of
his
*NL*
word
,
he
contrived
-LRB-
the
very
next
evening
,
I
believe
-RRB-
to
send
off
*NL*
the
Government
cutter
on
some
urgent
bit
of
special
service
.
As
her
*NL*
commander
could
not
spare
a
prize
crew
,
he
contented
himself
by
taking
*NL*
away
before
he
left
all
the
sails
of
Brown
's
schooner
to
the
very
last
*NL*
rag
,
and
took
good
care
to
tow
his
two
boats
on
to
the
beach
a
couple
of
*NL*
miles
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
in
Brown
's
crew
there
was
a
Solomon
Islander
,
kidnapped
in
his
*NL*
youth
and
devoted
to
Brown
,
who
was
the
best
man
of
the
whole
gang
.
That
*NL*
fellow
swam
off
to
the
coaster
--
five
hundred
yards
or
so
--
with
the
end
*NL*
of
a
warp
made
up
of
all
the
running
gear
unrove
for
the
purpose
.
The
*NL*
water
was
smooth
,
and
the
bay
dark
,
``
like
the
inside
of
a
cow
,
''
as
Brown
*NL*
described
it
.
The
Solomon
Islander
clambered
over
the
bulwarks
with
the
*NL*
end
of
the
rope
in
his
teeth
.
The
crew
of
the
coaster
--
all
Tagals
--
were
*NL*
ashore
having
a
jollification
in
the
native
village
.
The
two
shipkeepers
*NL*
left
on
board
woke
up
suddenly
and
saw
the
devil
.
It
had
glittering
eyes
*NL*
and
leaped
quick
as
lightning
about
the
deck
.
They
fell
on
their
knees
,
*NL*
paralysed
with
fear
,
crossing
themselves
and
mumbling
prayers
.
With
*NL*
a
long
knife
he
found
in
the
caboose
the
Solomon
Islander
,
without
*NL*
interrupting
their
orisons
,
stabbed
first
one
,
then
the
other
;
with
the
*NL*
same
knife
he
set
to
sawing
patiently
at
the
coir
cable
till
suddenly
it
*NL*
parted
under
the
blade
with
a
splash
.
Then
in
the
silence
of
the
bay
*NL*
he
let
out
a
cautious
shout
,
and
Brown
's
gang
,
who
meantime
had
been
*NL*
peering
and
straining
their
hopeful
ears
in
the
darkness
,
began
to
*NL*
pull
gently
at
their
end
of
the
warp
.
In
less
than
five
minutes
the
two
*NL*
schooners
came
together
with
a
slight
shock
and
a
creak
of
spars
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Brown
's
crowd
transferred
themselves
without
losing
an
instant
,
taking
*NL*
with
them
their
firearms
and
a
large
supply
of
ammunition
.
They
were
*NL*
sixteen
in
all
:
two
runaway
blue-jackets
,
a
lanky
deserter
from
a
Yankee
*NL*
man-of-war
,
a
couple
of
simple
,
blond
Scandinavians
,
a
mulatto
of
sorts
,
*NL*
one
bland
Chinaman
who
cooked
--
and
the
rest
of
the
nondescript
spawn
*NL*
of
the
South
Seas
.
None
of
them
cared
;
Brown
bent
them
to
his
will
,
and
*NL*
Brown
,
indifferent
to
gallows
,
was
running
away
from
the
spectre
of
*NL*
a
Spanish
prison
.
He
did
n't
give
them
the
time
to
trans-ship
enough
*NL*
provisions
;
the
weather
was
calm
,
the
air
was
charged
with
dew
,
and
when
*NL*
they
cast
off
the
ropes
and
set
sail
to
a
faint
off-shore
draught
there
*NL*
was
no
flutter
in
the
damp
canvas
;
their
old
schooner
seemed
to
detach
*NL*
itself
gently
from
the
stolen
craft
and
slip
away
silently
,
together
*NL*
with
the
black
mass
of
the
coast
,
into
the
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
got
clear
away
.
Brown
related
to
me
in
detail
their
passage
down
*NL*
the
Straits
of
Macassar
.
It
is
a
harrowing
and
desperate
story
.
They
*NL*
were
short
of
food
and
water
;
they
boarded
several
native
craft
and
got
*NL*
a
little
from
each
.
With
a
stolen
ship
Brown
did
not
dare
to
put
into
*NL*
any
port
,
of
course
.
He
had
no
money
to
buy
anything
,
no
papers
to
show
,
*NL*
and
no
lie
plausible
enough
to
get
him
out
again
.
An
Arab
barque
,
under
*NL*
the
Dutch
flag
,
surprised
one
night
at
anchor
off
Poulo
Laut
,
yielded
a
*NL*
little
dirty
rice
,
a
bunch
of
bananas
,
and
a
cask
of
water
;
three
days
*NL*
of
squally
,
misty
weather
from
the
north-east
shot
the
schooner
across
*NL*
the
Java
Sea
.
The
yellow
muddy
waves
drenched
that
collection
of
hungry
*NL*
ruffians
.
They
sighted
mail-boats
moving
on
their
appointed
routes
;
*NL*
passed
well-found
home
ships
with
rusty
iron
sides
anchored
in
the
*NL*
shallow
sea
waiting
for
a
change
of
weather
or
the
turn
of
the
tide
;
an
*NL*
English
gunboat
,
white
and
trim
,
with
two
slim
masts
,
crossed
their
bows
*NL*
one
day
in
the
distance
;
and
on
another
occasion
a
Dutch
corvette
,
black
*NL*
and
heavily
sparred
,
loomed
up
on
their
quarter
,
steaming
dead
slow
*NL*
in
the
mist
.
They
slipped
through
unseen
or
disregarded
,
a
wan
,
*NL*
sallow-faced
band
of
utter
outcasts
,
enraged
with
hunger
and
hunted
by
*NL*
fear
.
Brown
's
idea
was
to
make
for
Madagascar
,
where
he
expected
,
on
*NL*
grounds
not
altogether
illusory
,
to
sell
the
schooner
in
Tamatave
,
and
*NL*
no
questions
asked
,
or
perhaps
obtain
some
more
or
less
forged
papers
*NL*
for
her
.
Yet
before
he
could
face
the
long
passage
across
the
Indian
*NL*
Ocean
food
was
wanted
--
water
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Perhaps
he
had
heard
of
Patusan
--
or
perhaps
he
just
only
happened
to
*NL*
see
the
name
written
in
small
letters
on
the
chart
--
probably
that
of
a
*NL*
largish
village
up
a
river
in
a
native
state
,
perfectly
defenceless
,
far
*NL*
from
the
beaten
tracks
of
the
sea
and
from
the
ends
of
submarine
cables
.
*NL*
He
had
done
that
kind
of
thing
before
--
in
the
way
of
business
;
*NL*
and
this
now
was
an
absolute
necessity
,
a
question
of
life
and
*NL*
death
--
or
rather
of
liberty
.
Of
liberty
!
He
was
sure
to
get
*NL*
provisions
--
bullocks
--
rice
--
sweet-potatoes
.
The
sorry
gang
licked
*NL*
their
chops
.
A
cargo
of
produce
for
the
schooner
perhaps
could
be
*NL*
extorted
--
and
,
who
knows
?
--
some
real
ringing
coined
money
!
Some
of
these
*NL*
chiefs
and
village
headmen
can
be
made
to
part
freely
.
He
told
me
he
*NL*
would
have
roasted
their
toes
rather
than
be
baulked
.
I
believe
him
.
His
*NL*
men
believed
him
too
.
They
did
n't
cheer
aloud
,
being
a
dumb
pack
,
but
*NL*
made
ready
wolfishly
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Luck
served
him
as
to
weather
.
A
few
days
of
calm
would
have
brought
*NL*
unmentionable
horrors
on
board
that
schooner
,
but
with
the
help
of
land
*NL*
and
sea
breezes
,
in
less
than
a
week
after
clearing
the
Sunda
Straits
,
*NL*
he
anchored
off
the
Batu
Kring
mouth
within
a
pistol-shot
of
the
fishing
*NL*
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Fourteen
of
them
packed
into
the
schooner
's
long-boat
-LRB-
which
was
big
,
*NL*
having
been
used
for
cargo-work
-RRB-
and
started
up
the
river
,
while
two
*NL*
remained
in
charge
of
the
schooner
with
food
enough
to
keep
starvation
*NL*
off
for
ten
days
.
The
tide
and
wind
helped
,
and
early
one
afternoon
the
*NL*
big
white
boat
under
a
ragged
sail
shouldered
its
way
before
the
sea
*NL*
breeze
into
Patusan
Reach
,
manned
by
fourteen
assorted
scarecrows
*NL*
glaring
hungrily
ahead
,
and
fingering
the
breech-blocks
of
cheap
rifles
.
*NL*
Brown
calculated
upon
the
terrifying
surprise
of
his
appearance
.
They
*NL*
sailed
in
with
the
last
of
the
flood
;
the
Rajah
's
stockade
gave
no
sign
;
*NL*
the
first
houses
on
both
sides
of
the
stream
seemed
deserted
.
A
few
*NL*
canoes
were
seen
up
the
reach
in
full
flight
.
Brown
was
astonished
at
*NL*
the
size
of
the
place
.
A
profound
silence
reigned
.
The
wind
dropped
*NL*
between
the
houses
;
two
oars
were
got
out
and
the
boat
held
on
*NL*
up-stream
,
the
idea
being
to
effect
a
lodgment
in
the
centre
of
the
town
*NL*
before
the
inhabitants
could
think
of
resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
seems
,
however
,
that
the
headman
of
the
fishing
village
at
Batu
*NL*
Kring
had
managed
to
send
off
a
timely
warning
.
When
the
long-boat
came
*NL*
abreast
of
the
mosque
-LRB-
which
Doramin
had
built
:
a
structure
with
gables
*NL*
and
roof
finials
of
carved
coral
-RRB-
the
open
space
before
it
was
full
of
*NL*
people
.
A
shout
went
up
,
and
was
followed
by
a
clash
of
gongs
all
up
the
*NL*
river
.
From
a
point
above
two
little
brass
6-pounders
were
discharged
,
*NL*
and
the
round-shot
came
skipping
down
the
empty
reach
,
spurting
*NL*
glittering
jets
of
water
in
the
sunshine
.
In
front
of
the
mosque
a
*NL*
shouting
lot
of
men
began
firing
in
volleys
that
whipped
athwart
the
*NL*
current
of
the
river
;
an
irregular
,
rolling
fusillade
was
opened
on
the
*NL*
boat
from
both
banks
,
and
Brown
's
men
replied
with
a
wild
,
rapid
fire
.
*NL*
The
oars
had
been
got
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
turn
of
the
tide
at
high
water
comes
on
very
quickly
in
that
river
,
*NL*
and
the
boat
in
mid-stream
,
nearly
hidden
in
smoke
,
began
to
drift
back
*NL*
stern
foremost
.
Along
both
shores
the
smoke
thickened
also
,
lying
below
*NL*
the
roofs
in
a
level
streak
as
you
may
see
a
long
cloud
cutting
the
*NL*
slope
of
a
mountain
.
A
tumult
of
war-cries
,
the
vibrating
clang
*NL*
of
gongs
,
the
deep
snoring
of
drums
,
yells
of
rage
,
crashes
of
*NL*
volley-firing
,
made
an
awful
din
,
in
which
Brown
sat
confounded
but
*NL*
steady
at
the
tiller
,
working
himself
into
a
fury
of
hate
and
rage
*NL*
against
those
people
who
dared
to
defend
themselves
.
Two
of
his
men
*NL*
had
been
wounded
,
and
he
saw
his
retreat
cut
off
below
the
town
by
some
*NL*
boats
that
had
put
off
from
Tunku
Allang
's
stockade
.
There
were
six
of
*NL*
them
,
full
of
men
.
While
he
was
thus
beset
he
perceived
the
entrance
of
*NL*
the
narrow
creek
-LRB-
the
same
which
Jim
had
jumped
at
low
water
-RRB-
.
It
was
*NL*
then
brim
full
.
Steering
the
long-boat
in
,
they
landed
,
and
,
to
make
a
*NL*
long
story
short
,
they
established
themselves
on
a
little
knoll
about
*NL*
900
yards
from
the
stockade
,
which
,
in
fact
,
they
commanded
from
that
*NL*
position
.
The
slopes
of
the
knoll
were
bare
,
but
there
were
a
few
trees
*NL*
on
the
summit
.
They
went
to
work
cutting
these
down
for
a
breastwork
,
*NL*
and
were
fairly
intrenched
before
dark
;
meantime
the
Rajah
's
boats
*NL*
remained
in
the
river
with
curious
neutrality
.
When
the
sun
set
the
glue
*NL*
of
many
brushwood
blazes
lighted
on
the
river-front
,
and
between
the
*NL*
double
line
of
houses
on
the
land
side
threw
into
black
relief
the
*NL*
roofs
,
the
groups
of
slender
palms
,
the
heavy
clumps
of
fruit
trees
.
*NL*
Brown
ordered
the
grass
round
his
position
to
be
fired
;
a
low
ring
of
*NL*
thin
flames
under
the
slow
ascending
smoke
wriggled
rapidly
down
the
*NL*
slopes
of
the
knoll
;
here
and
there
a
dry
bush
caught
with
a
tall
,
*NL*
vicious
roar
.
The
conflagration
made
a
clear
zone
of
fire
for
the
rifles
*NL*
of
the
small
party
,
and
expired
smouldering
on
the
edge
of
the
forests
*NL*
and
along
the
muddy
bank
of
the
creek
.
A
strip
of
jungle
luxuriating
in
*NL*
a
damp
hollow
between
the
knoll
and
the
Rajah
's
stockade
stopped
it
*NL*
on
that
side
with
a
great
crackling
and
detonations
of
bursting
bamboo
*NL*
stems
.
The
sky
was
sombre
,
velvety
,
and
swarming
with
stars
.
The
*NL*
blackened
ground
smoked
quietly
with
low
creeping
wisps
,
till
a
little
*NL*
breeze
came
on
and
blew
everything
away
.
Brown
expected
an
attack
to
*NL*
be
delivered
as
soon
as
the
tide
had
flowed
enough
again
to
enable
the
*NL*
war-boats
which
had
cut
off
his
retreat
to
enter
the
creek
.
At
any
rate
*NL*
he
was
sure
there
would
be
an
attempt
to
carry
off
his
long-boat
,
*NL*
which
lay
below
the
hill
,
a
dark
high
lump
on
the
feeble
sheen
of
a
wet
*NL*
mud-flat
.
But
no
move
of
any
sort
was
made
by
the
boats
in
the
river
.
*NL*
Over
the
stockade
and
the
Rajah
's
buildings
Brown
saw
their
lights
on
*NL*
the
water
.
They
seemed
to
be
anchored
across
the
stream
.
Other
lights
*NL*
afloat
were
moving
in
the
reach
,
crossing
and
recrossing
from
side
to
*NL*
side
.
There
were
also
lights
twinkling
motionless
upon
the
long
walls
of
*NL*
houses
up
the
reach
,
as
far
as
the
bend
,
and
more
still
beyond
,
others
*NL*
isolated
inland
.
The
loom
of
the
big
fires
disclosed
buildings
,
roofs
,
*NL*
black
piles
as
far
as
he
could
see
.
It
was
an
immense
place
.
The
*NL*
fourteen
desperate
invaders
lying
flat
behind
the
felled
trees
raised
*NL*
their
chins
to
look
over
at
the
stir
of
that
town
that
seemed
to
extend
*NL*
up-river
for
miles
and
swarm
with
thousands
of
angry
men
.
They
did
not
*NL*
speak
to
each
other
.
Now
and
then
they
would
hear
a
loud
yell
,
or
a
*NL*
single
shot
rang
out
,
fired
very
far
somewhere
.
But
round
their
position
*NL*
everything
was
still
,
dark
,
silent
.
They
seemed
to
be
forgotten
,
as
if
*NL*
the
excitement
keeping
awake
all
the
population
had
nothing
to
do
with
*NL*
them
,
as
if
they
had
been
dead
already
.

CHAPTER
39
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
All
the
events
of
that
night
have
a
great
importance
,
since
they
*NL*
brought
about
a
situation
which
remained
unchanged
till
Jim
's
return
.
*NL*
Jim
had
been
away
in
the
interior
for
more
than
a
week
,
and
it
was
Dain
*NL*
Waris
who
had
directed
the
first
repulse
.
That
brave
and
intelligent
*NL*
youth
-LRB-
``
who
knew
how
to
fight
after
the
manner
of
white
men
''
-RRB-
wished
to
*NL*
settle
the
business
off-hand
,
but
his
people
were
too
much
for
him
.
*NL*
He
had
not
Jim
's
racial
prestige
and
the
reputation
of
invincible
,
*NL*
supernatural
power
.
He
was
not
the
visible
,
tangible
incarnation
of
*NL*
unfailing
truth
and
of
unfailing
victory
.
Beloved
,
trusted
,
and
*NL*
admired
as
he
was
,
he
was
still
one
of
_
them
_
,
while
Jim
was
one
of
*NL*
us
.
Moreover
,
the
white
man
,
a
tower
of
strength
in
himself
,
was
*NL*
invulnerable
,
while
Dain
Waris
could
be
killed
.
Those
unexpressed
*NL*
thoughts
guided
the
opinions
of
the
chief
men
of
the
town
,
who
elected
*NL*
to
assemble
in
Jim
's
fort
for
deliberation
upon
the
emergency
,
as
if
*NL*
expecting
to
find
wisdom
and
courage
in
the
dwelling
of
the
absent
white
*NL*
man
.
The
shooting
of
Brown
's
ruffians
was
so
far
good
,
or
lucky
,
that
*NL*
there
had
been
half-a-dozen
casualties
amongst
the
defenders
.
The
*NL*
wounded
were
lying
on
the
verandah
tended
by
their
women-folk
.
The
women
*NL*
and
children
from
the
lower
part
of
the
town
had
been
sent
into
the
*NL*
fort
at
the
first
alarm
.
There
Jewel
was
in
command
,
very
efficient
and
*NL*
high-spirited
,
obeyed
by
Jim
's
``
own
people
,
''
who
,
quitting
in
a
body
*NL*
their
little
settlement
under
the
stockade
,
had
gone
in
to
form
the
*NL*
garrison
.
The
refugees
crowded
round
her
;
and
through
the
whole
affair
,
*NL*
to
the
very
disastrous
last
,
she
showed
an
extraordinary
martial
ardour
.
*NL*
It
was
to
her
that
Dain
Waris
had
gone
at
once
at
the
first
intelligence
*NL*
of
danger
,
for
you
must
know
that
Jim
was
the
only
one
in
Patusan
who
*NL*
possessed
a
store
of
gunpowder
.
Stein
,
with
whom
he
had
kept
up
intimate
*NL*
relations
by
letters
,
had
obtained
from
the
Dutch
Government
a
special
*NL*
authorisation
to
export
five
hundred
kegs
of
it
to
Patusan
.
The
*NL*
powder-magazine
was
a
small
hut
of
rough
logs
covered
entirely
with
*NL*
earth
,
and
in
Jim
's
absence
the
girl
had
the
key
.
In
the
council
,
held
*NL*
at
eleven
o'clock
in
the
evening
in
Jim
's
dining-room
,
she
backed
up
*NL*
Waris
's
advice
for
immediate
and
vigorous
action
.
I
am
told
that
she
*NL*
stood
up
by
the
side
of
Jim
's
empty
chair
at
the
head
of
the
long
table
*NL*
and
made
a
warlike
impassioned
speech
,
which
for
the
moment
extorted
*NL*
murmurs
of
approbation
from
the
assembled
headmen
.
Old
Doramin
,
who
had
*NL*
not
showed
himself
outside
his
own
gate
for
more
than
a
year
,
had
been
*NL*
brought
across
with
great
difficulty
.
He
was
,
of
course
,
the
chief
man
*NL*
there
.
The
temper
of
the
council
was
very
unforgiving
,
and
the
old
man
's
*NL*
word
would
have
been
decisive
;
but
it
is
my
opinion
that
,
well
aware
of
*NL*
his
son
's
fiery
courage
,
he
dared
not
pronounce
the
word
.
More
dilatory
*NL*
counsels
prevailed
.
A
certain
Haji
Saman
pointed
out
at
great
length
*NL*
that
``
these
tyrannical
and
ferocious
men
had
delivered
themselves
to
*NL*
a
certain
death
in
any
case
.
They
would
stand
fast
on
their
hill
and
*NL*
starve
,
or
they
would
try
to
regain
their
boat
and
be
shot
from
ambushes
*NL*
across
the
creek
,
or
they
would
break
and
fly
into
the
forest
and
perish
*NL*
singly
there
.
''
He
argued
that
by
the
use
of
proper
stratagems
these
*NL*
evil-minded
strangers
could
be
destroyed
without
the
risk
of
a
battle
,
*NL*
and
his
words
had
a
great
weight
,
especially
with
the
Patusan
men
*NL*
proper
.
What
unsettled
the
minds
of
the
townsfolk
was
the
failure
of
*NL*
the
Rajah
's
boats
to
act
at
the
decisive
moment
.
It
was
the
diplomatic
*NL*
Kassim
who
represented
the
Rajah
at
the
council
.
He
spoke
very
little
,
*NL*
listened
smilingly
,
very
friendly
and
impenetrable
.
During
the
sitting
*NL*
messengers
kept
arriving
every
few
minutes
almost
,
with
reports
of
the
*NL*
invaders
'
proceedings
.
Wild
and
exaggerated
rumours
were
flying
:
there
*NL*
was
a
large
ship
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
with
big
guns
and
many
more
*NL*
men
--
some
white
,
others
with
black
skins
and
of
bloodthirsty
appearance
.
*NL*
They
were
coming
with
many
more
boats
to
exterminate
every
living
thing
.
*NL*
A
sense
of
near
,
incomprehensible
danger
affected
the
common
people
.
*NL*
At
one
moment
there
was
a
panic
in
the
courtyard
amongst
the
women
;
*NL*
shrieking
;
a
rush
;
children
crying
--
Haji
Sunan
went
out
to
quiet
them
.
*NL*
Then
a
fort
sentry
fired
at
something
moving
on
the
river
,
and
nearly
*NL*
killed
a
villager
bringing
in
his
women-folk
in
a
canoe
together
with
*NL*
the
best
of
his
domestic
utensils
and
a
dozen
fowls
.
This
caused
more
*NL*
confusion
.
Meantime
the
palaver
inside
Jim
's
house
went
on
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
the
girl
.
Doramin
sat
fierce-faced
,
heavy
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
speakers
in
turn
,
and
breathing
slow
like
a
bull
.
He
did
n't
speak
till
*NL*
the
last
,
after
Kassim
had
declared
that
the
Rajah
's
boats
would
be
*NL*
called
in
because
the
men
were
required
to
defend
his
master
's
stockade
.
*NL*
Dain
Waris
in
his
father
's
presence
would
offer
no
opinion
,
though
the
*NL*
girl
entreated
him
in
Jim
's
name
to
speak
out
.
She
offered
him
Jim
's
own
*NL*
men
in
her
anxiety
to
have
these
intruders
driven
out
at
once
.
He
only
*NL*
shook
his
head
,
after
a
glance
or
two
at
Doramin
.
Finally
,
when
the
*NL*
council
broke
up
it
had
been
decided
that
the
houses
nearest
the
creek
*NL*
should
be
strongly
occupied
to
obtain
the
command
of
the
enemy
's
boat
.
*NL*
The
boat
itself
was
not
to
be
interfered
with
openly
,
so
that
the
*NL*
robbers
on
the
hill
should
be
tempted
to
embark
,
when
a
well-directed
*NL*
fire
would
kill
most
of
them
,
no
doubt
.
To
cut
off
the
escape
of
those
*NL*
who
might
survive
,
and
to
prevent
more
of
them
coming
up
,
Dain
Waris
was
*NL*
ordered
by
Doramin
to
take
an
armed
party
of
Bugis
down
the
river
to
a
*NL*
certain
spot
ten
miles
below
Patusan
,
and
there
form
a
camp
on
the
shore
*NL*
and
blockade
the
stream
with
the
canoes
.
I
do
n't
believe
for
a
moment
*NL*
that
Doramin
feared
the
arrival
of
fresh
forces
.
My
opinion
is
that
his
*NL*
conduct
was
guided
solely
by
his
wish
to
keep
his
son
out
of
harm
's
*NL*
way
.
To
prevent
a
rush
being
made
into
the
town
the
construction
of
a
*NL*
stockade
was
to
be
commenced
at
daylight
at
the
end
of
the
street
on
*NL*
the
left
bank
.
The
old
nakhoda
declared
his
intention
to
command
there
*NL*
himself
.
A
distribution
of
powder
,
bullets
,
and
percussion-caps
was
made
*NL*
immediately
under
the
girl
's
supervision
.
Several
messengers
were
to
be
*NL*
dispatched
in
different
directions
after
Jim
,
whose
exact
whereabouts
*NL*
were
unknown
.
These
men
started
at
dawn
,
but
before
that
time
Kassim
had
*NL*
managed
to
open
communications
with
the
besieged
Brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
That
accomplished
diplomatist
and
confidant
of
the
Rajah
,
on
leaving
*NL*
the
fort
to
go
back
to
his
master
,
took
into
his
boat
Cornelius
,
whom
he
*NL*
found
slinking
mutely
amongst
the
people
in
the
courtyard
.
Kassim
had
a
*NL*
little
plan
of
his
own
and
wanted
him
for
an
interpreter
.
Thus
it
came
*NL*
about
that
towards
morning
Brown
,
reflecting
upon
the
desperate
nature
*NL*
of
his
position
,
heard
from
the
marshy
overgrown
hollow
an
amicable
,
*NL*
quavering
,
strained
voice
crying
--
in
English
--
for
permission
to
come
up
,
*NL*
under
a
promise
of
personal
safety
and
on
a
very
important
errand
.
He
*NL*
was
overjoyed
.
If
he
was
spoken
to
he
was
no
longer
a
hunted
wild
beast
.
*NL*
These
friendly
sounds
took
off
at
once
the
awful
stress
of
vigilant
*NL*
watchfulness
as
of
so
many
blind
men
not
knowing
whence
the
deathblow
*NL*
might
come
.
He
pretended
a
great
reluctance
.
The
voice
declared
itself
*NL*
``
a
white
man
--
a
poor
,
ruined
,
old
man
who
had
been
living
here
for
*NL*
years
.
''
A
mist
,
wet
and
chilly
,
lay
on
the
slopes
of
the
hill
,
and
after
*NL*
some
more
shouting
from
one
to
the
other
,
Brown
called
out
,
``
Come
on
,
*NL*
then
,
but
alone
,
mind
!
''
As
a
matter
of
fact
--
he
told
me
,
writhing
with
*NL*
rage
at
the
recollection
of
his
helplessness
--
it
made
no
difference
.
*NL*
They
could
n't
see
more
than
a
few
yards
before
them
,
and
no
treachery
*NL*
could
make
their
position
worse
.
By-and-by
Cornelius
,
in
his
*NL*
week-day
attire
of
a
ragged
dirty
shirt
and
pants
,
barefooted
,
with
a
*NL*
broken-rimmed
pith
hat
on
his
head
,
was
made
out
vaguely
,
sidling
up
to
*NL*
the
defences
,
hesitating
,
stopping
to
listen
in
a
peering
posture
.
``
Come
*NL*
along
!
You
are
safe
,
''
yelled
Brown
,
while
his
men
stared
.
All
their
*NL*
hopes
of
life
became
suddenly
centered
in
that
dilapidated
,
mean
*NL*
newcomer
,
who
in
profound
silence
clambered
clumsily
over
a
felled
*NL*
tree-trunk
,
and
shivering
,
with
his
sour
,
mistrustful
face
,
looked
about
*NL*
at
the
knot
of
bearded
,
anxious
,
sleepless
desperadoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Half
an
hour
's
confidential
talk
with
Cornelius
opened
Brown
's
eyes
as
*NL*
to
the
home
affairs
of
Patusan
.
He
was
on
the
alert
at
once
.
There
were
*NL*
possibilities
,
immense
possibilities
;
but
before
he
would
talk
over
*NL*
Cornelius
's
proposals
he
demanded
that
some
food
should
be
sent
up
as
*NL*
a
guarantee
of
good
faith
.
Cornelius
went
off
,
creeping
sluggishly
down
*NL*
the
hill
on
the
side
of
the
Rajah
's
palace
,
and
after
some
delay
a
*NL*
few
of
Tunku
Allang
's
men
came
up
,
bringing
a
scanty
supply
of
rice
,
*NL*
chillies
,
and
dried
fish
.
This
was
immeasurably
better
than
nothing
.
*NL*
Later
on
Cornelius
returned
accompanying
Kassim
,
who
stepped
out
with
*NL*
an
air
of
perfect
good-humoured
trustfulness
,
in
sandals
,
and
muffled
*NL*
up
from
neck
to
ankles
in
dark-blue
sheeting
.
He
shook
hands
with
Brown
*NL*
discreetly
,
and
the
three
drew
aside
for
a
conference
.
Brown
's
men
,
*NL*
recovering
their
confidence
,
were
slapping
each
other
on
the
back
,
and
*NL*
cast
knowing
glances
at
their
captain
while
they
busied
themselves
with
*NL*
preparations
for
cooking
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Kassim
disliked
Doramin
and
his
Bugis
very
much
,
but
he
hated
the
new
*NL*
order
of
things
still
more
.
It
had
occurred
to
him
that
these
whites
,
*NL*
together
with
the
Rajah
's
followers
,
could
attack
and
defeat
the
*NL*
Bugis
before
Jim
's
return
.
Then
,
he
reasoned
,
general
defection
of
*NL*
the
townsfolk
was
sure
to
follow
,
and
the
reign
of
the
white
man
who
*NL*
protected
poor
people
would
be
over
.
Afterwards
the
new
allies
could
be
*NL*
dealt
with
.
They
would
have
no
friends
.
The
fellow
was
perfectly
able
to
*NL*
perceive
the
difference
of
character
,
and
had
seen
enough
of
white
men
*NL*
to
know
that
these
newcomers
were
outcasts
,
men
without
country
.
*NL*
Brown
preserved
a
stern
and
inscrutable
demeanour
.
When
he
first
heard
*NL*
Cornelius
's
voice
demanding
admittance
,
it
brought
merely
the
hope
of
a
*NL*
loophole
for
escape
.
In
less
than
an
hour
other
thoughts
were
seething
*NL*
in
his
head
.
Urged
by
an
extreme
necessity
,
he
had
come
there
to
steal
*NL*
food
,
a
few
tons
of
rubber
or
gum
may
be
,
perhaps
a
handful
of
dollars
,
*NL*
and
had
found
himself
enmeshed
by
deadly
dangers
.
Now
in
consequence
*NL*
of
these
overtures
from
Kassim
he
began
to
think
of
stealing
the
whole
*NL*
country
.
Some
confounded
fellow
had
apparently
accomplished
something
of
*NL*
the
kind
--
single-handed
at
that
.
Could
n't
have
done
it
very
well
though
.
*NL*
Perhaps
they
could
work
together
--
squeeze
everything
dry
and
then
go
out
*NL*
quietly
.
In
the
course
of
his
negotiations
with
Kassim
he
became
aware
*NL*
that
he
was
supposed
to
have
a
big
ship
with
plenty
of
men
outside
.
*NL*
Kassim
begged
him
earnestly
to
have
this
big
ship
with
his
many
guns
and
*NL*
men
brought
up
the
river
without
delay
for
the
Rajah
's
service
.
Brown
*NL*
professed
himself
willing
,
and
on
this
basis
the
negotiation
was
carried
*NL*
on
with
mutual
distrust
.
Three
times
in
the
course
of
the
morning
the
*NL*
courteous
and
active
Kassim
went
down
to
consult
the
Rajah
and
came
up
*NL*
busily
with
his
long
stride
.
Brown
,
while
bargaining
,
had
a
sort
of
grim
*NL*
enjoyment
in
thinking
of
his
wretched
schooner
,
with
nothing
but
a
heap
*NL*
of
dirt
in
her
hold
,
that
stood
for
an
armed
ship
,
and
a
Chinaman
and
*NL*
a
lame
ex-beachcomber
of
Levuka
on
board
,
who
represented
all
his
many
*NL*
men
.
In
the
afternoon
he
obtained
further
doles
of
food
,
a
promise
*NL*
of
some
money
,
and
a
supply
of
mats
for
his
men
to
make
shelters
*NL*
for
themselves
.
They
lay
down
and
snored
,
protected
from
the
burning
*NL*
sunshine
;
but
Brown
,
sitting
fully
exposed
on
one
of
the
felled
trees
,
*NL*
feasted
his
eyes
upon
the
view
of
the
town
and
the
river
.
There
was
much
*NL*
loot
there
.
Cornelius
,
who
had
made
himself
at
home
in
the
camp
,
talked
*NL*
at
his
elbow
,
pointing
out
the
localities
,
imparting
advice
,
giving
his
*NL*
own
version
of
Jim
's
character
,
and
commenting
in
his
own
fashion
upon
*NL*
the
events
of
the
last
three
years
.
Brown
,
who
,
apparently
indifferent
*NL*
and
gazing
away
,
listened
with
attention
to
every
word
,
could
not
make
*NL*
out
clearly
what
sort
of
man
this
Jim
could
be
.
``
What
's
his
name
?
*NL*
Jim
!
Jim
!
That
's
not
enough
for
a
man
's
name
.
''
``
They
call
him
,
''
said
*NL*
Cornelius
scornfully
,
``
Tuan
Jim
here
.
As
you
may
say
Lord
Jim
.
''
``
What
is
*NL*
he
?
Where
does
he
come
from
?
''
inquired
Brown
.
``
What
sort
of
man
is
he
?
*NL*
Is
he
an
Englishman
?
''
``
Yes
,
yes
,
he
's
an
Englishman
.
I
am
an
Englishman
*NL*
too
.
From
Malacca
.
He
is
a
fool
.
All
you
have
to
do
is
to
kill
him
and
*NL*
then
you
are
king
here
.
Everything
belongs
to
him
,
''
explained
Cornelius
.
*NL*
``
It
strikes
me
he
may
be
made
to
share
with
somebody
before
very
long
,
''
*NL*
commented
Brown
half
aloud
.
``
No
,
no
.
The
proper
way
is
to
kill
him
the
*NL*
first
chance
you
get
,
and
then
you
can
do
what
you
like
,
''
Cornelius
*NL*
would
insist
earnestly
.
``
I
have
lived
for
many
years
here
,
and
I
am
*NL*
giving
you
a
friend
's
advice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
such
converse
and
in
gloating
over
the
view
of
Patusan
,
which
he
had
*NL*
determined
in
his
mind
should
become
his
prey
,
Brown
whiled
away
most
*NL*
of
the
afternoon
,
his
men
,
meantime
,
resting
.
On
that
day
Dain
Waris
's
*NL*
fleet
of
canoes
stole
one
by
one
under
the
shore
farthest
from
the
*NL*
creek
,
and
went
down
to
close
the
river
against
his
retreat
.
Of
this
*NL*
Brown
was
not
aware
,
and
Kassim
,
who
came
up
the
knoll
an
hour
before
*NL*
sunset
,
took
good
care
not
to
enlighten
him
.
He
wanted
the
white
*NL*
man
's
ship
to
come
up
the
river
,
and
this
news
,
he
feared
,
would
be
*NL*
discouraging
.
He
was
very
pressing
with
Brown
to
send
the
``
order
,
''
*NL*
offering
at
the
same
time
a
trusty
messenger
,
who
for
greater
secrecy
*NL*
-LRB-
as
he
explained
-RRB-
would
make
his
way
by
land
to
the
mouth
of
the
river
*NL*
and
deliver
the
``
order
''
on
board
.
After
some
reflection
Brown
judged
*NL*
it
expedient
to
tear
a
page
out
of
his
pocket-book
,
on
which
he
simply
*NL*
wrote
,
``
We
are
getting
on
.
Big
job
.
Detain
the
man
.
''
The
stolid
youth
*NL*
selected
by
Kassim
for
that
service
performed
it
faithfully
,
and
was
*NL*
rewarded
by
being
suddenly
tipped
,
head
first
,
into
the
schooner
's
empty
*NL*
hold
by
the
ex-beachcomber
and
the
Chinaman
,
who
thereupon
hastened
to
*NL*
put
on
the
hatches
.
What
became
of
him
afterwards
Brown
did
not
say
.

CHAPTER
40
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Brown
's
object
was
to
gain
time
by
fooling
with
Kassim
's
diplomacy
.
For
*NL*
doing
a
real
stroke
of
business
he
could
not
help
thinking
the
white
man
*NL*
was
the
person
to
work
with
.
He
could
not
imagine
such
a
chap
-LRB-
who
must
*NL*
be
confoundedly
clever
after
all
to
get
hold
of
the
natives
like
*NL*
that
-RRB-
refusing
a
help
that
would
do
away
with
the
necessity
for
slow
,
*NL*
cautious
,
risky
cheating
,
that
imposed
itself
as
the
only
possible
*NL*
line
of
conduct
for
a
single-handed
man
.
He
,
Brown
,
would
offer
him
*NL*
the
power
.
No
man
could
hesitate
.
Everything
was
in
coming
to
a
clear
*NL*
understanding
.
Of
course
they
would
share
.
The
idea
of
there
being
a
*NL*
fort
--
all
ready
to
his
hand
--
a
real
fort
,
with
artillery
-LRB-
he
knew
this
*NL*
from
Cornelius
-RRB-
,
excited
him
.
Let
him
only
once
get
in
and
...
He
*NL*
would
impose
modest
conditions
.
Not
too
low
,
though
.
The
man
was
no
*NL*
fool
,
it
seemed
.
They
would
work
like
brothers
till
...
till
the
time
*NL*
came
for
a
quarrel
and
a
shot
that
would
settle
all
accounts
.
With
grim
*NL*
impatience
of
plunder
he
wished
himself
to
be
talking
with
the
man
now
.
*NL*
The
land
already
seemed
to
be
his
to
tear
to
pieces
,
squeeze
,
and
throw
*NL*
away
.
Meantime
Kassim
had
to
be
fooled
for
the
sake
of
food
first
--
and
*NL*
for
a
second
string
.
But
the
principal
thing
was
to
get
something
to
eat
*NL*
from
day
to
day
.
Besides
,
he
was
not
averse
to
begin
fighting
on
that
*NL*
Rajah
's
account
,
and
teach
a
lesson
to
those
people
who
had
received
him
*NL*
with
shots
.
The
lust
of
battle
was
upon
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
am
sorry
that
I
ca
n't
give
you
this
part
of
the
story
,
which
of
*NL*
course
I
have
mainly
from
Brown
,
in
Brown
's
own
words
.
There
was
in
the
*NL*
broken
,
violent
speech
of
that
man
,
unveiling
before
me
his
thoughts
*NL*
with
the
very
hand
of
Death
upon
his
throat
,
an
undisguised
ruthlessness
*NL*
of
purpose
,
a
strange
vengeful
attitude
towards
his
own
past
,
and
a
*NL*
blind
belief
in
the
righteousness
of
his
will
against
all
mankind
,
*NL*
something
of
that
feeling
which
could
induce
the
leader
of
a
horde
of
*NL*
wandering
cut-throats
to
call
himself
proudly
the
Scourge
of
God
.
*NL*
No
doubt
the
natural
senseless
ferocity
which
is
the
basis
of
such
*NL*
a
character
was
exasperated
by
failure
,
ill-luck
,
and
the
recent
*NL*
privations
,
as
well
as
by
the
desperate
position
in
which
he
found
*NL*
himself
;
but
what
was
most
remarkable
of
all
was
this
,
that
while
he
*NL*
planned
treacherous
alliances
,
had
already
settled
in
his
own
mind
the
*NL*
fate
of
the
white
man
,
and
intrigued
in
an
overbearing
,
offhand
manner
*NL*
with
Kassim
,
one
could
perceive
that
what
he
had
really
desired
,
almost
*NL*
in
spite
of
himself
,
was
to
play
havoc
with
that
jungle
town
which
had
*NL*
defied
him
,
to
see
it
strewn
over
with
corpses
and
enveloped
in
flames
.
*NL*
Listening
to
his
pitiless
,
panting
voice
,
I
could
imagine
how
he
must
*NL*
have
looked
at
it
from
the
hillock
,
peopling
it
with
images
of
murder
*NL*
and
rapine
.
The
part
nearest
to
the
creek
wore
an
abandoned
aspect
,
*NL*
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
house
concealed
a
few
armed
men
on
the
*NL*
alert
.
Suddenly
beyond
the
stretch
of
waste
ground
,
interspersed
with
*NL*
small
patches
of
low
dense
bush
,
excavations
,
heaps
of
rubbish
,
with
*NL*
trodden
paths
between
,
a
man
,
solitary
and
looking
very
small
,
strolled
*NL*
out
into
the
deserted
opening
of
the
street
between
the
shut-up
,
dark
,
*NL*
lifeless
buildings
at
the
end
.
Perhaps
one
of
the
inhabitants
,
who
had
*NL*
fled
to
the
other
bank
of
the
river
,
coming
back
for
some
object
of
*NL*
domestic
use
.
Evidently
he
supposed
himself
quite
safe
at
that
distance
*NL*
from
the
hill
on
the
other
side
of
the
creek
.
A
light
stockade
,
set
up
*NL*
hastily
,
was
just
round
the
turn
of
the
street
,
full
of
his
friends
.
*NL*
He
moved
leisurely
.
Brown
saw
him
,
and
instantly
called
to
his
side
the
*NL*
Yankee
deserter
,
who
acted
as
a
sort
of
second
in
command
.
This
lanky
,
*NL*
loose-jointed
fellow
came
forward
,
wooden-faced
,
trailing
his
rifle
*NL*
lazily
.
When
he
understood
what
was
wanted
from
him
a
homicidal
and
*NL*
conceited
smile
uncovered
his
teeth
,
making
two
deep
folds
down
his
*NL*
sallow
,
leathery
cheeks
.
He
prided
himself
on
being
a
dead
shot
.
He
*NL*
dropped
on
one
knee
,
and
taking
aim
from
a
steady
rest
through
the
*NL*
unlopped
branches
of
a
felled
tree
,
fired
,
and
at
once
stood
up
to
look
.
*NL*
The
man
,
far
away
,
turned
his
head
to
the
report
,
made
another
step
*NL*
forward
,
seemed
to
hesitate
,
and
abruptly
got
down
on
his
hands
and
*NL*
knees
.
In
the
silence
that
fell
upon
the
sharp
crack
of
the
rifle
,
the
*NL*
dead
shot
,
keeping
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
quarry
,
guessed
that
``
this
*NL*
there
coon
's
health
would
never
be
a
source
of
anxiety
to
his
friends
*NL*
any
more
.
''
The
man
's
limbs
were
seen
to
move
rapidly
under
his
body
*NL*
in
an
endeavour
to
run
on
all-fours
.
In
that
empty
space
arose
a
*NL*
multitudinous
shout
of
dismay
and
surprise
.
The
man
sank
flat
,
face
*NL*
down
,
and
moved
no
more
.
``
That
showed
them
what
we
could
do
,
''
said
Brown
*NL*
to
me
.
``
Struck
the
fear
of
sudden
death
into
them
.
That
was
what
we
*NL*
wanted
.
They
were
two
hundred
to
one
,
and
this
gave
them
something
to
*NL*
think
over
for
the
night
.
Not
one
of
them
had
an
idea
of
such
a
long
*NL*
shot
before
.
That
beggar
belonging
to
the
Rajah
scooted
down-hill
with
*NL*
his
eyes
hanging
out
of
his
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
As
he
was
telling
me
this
he
tried
with
a
shaking
hand
to
wipe
the
thin
*NL*
foam
on
his
blue
lips
.
``
Two
hundred
to
one
.
Two
hundred
to
one
...
*NL*
strike
terror
,
...
terror
,
terror
,
I
tell
you
...
''
His
own
eyes
*NL*
were
starting
out
of
their
sockets
.
He
fell
back
,
clawing
the
air
with
*NL*
skinny
fingers
,
sat
up
again
,
bowed
and
hairy
,
glared
at
me
sideways
*NL*
like
some
man-beast
of
folk-lore
,
with
open
mouth
in
his
miserable
and
*NL*
awful
agony
before
he
got
his
speech
back
after
that
fit
.
There
are
*NL*
sights
one
never
forgets
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Furthermore
,
to
draw
the
enemy
's
fire
and
locate
such
parties
as
*NL*
might
have
been
hiding
in
the
bushes
along
the
creek
,
Brown
ordered
the
*NL*
Solomon
Islander
to
go
down
to
the
boat
and
bring
an
oar
,
as
you
send
a
*NL*
spaniel
after
a
stick
into
the
water
.
This
failed
,
and
the
fellow
came
*NL*
back
without
a
single
shot
having
been
fired
at
him
from
anywhere
.
*NL*
``
There
's
nobody
,
''
opined
some
of
the
men
.
It
is
``
onnatural
,
''
remarked
*NL*
the
Yankee
.
Kassim
had
gone
,
by
that
time
,
very
much
impressed
,
pleased
*NL*
too
,
and
also
uneasy
.
Pursuing
his
tortuous
policy
,
he
had
dispatched
a
*NL*
message
to
Dain
Waris
warning
him
to
look
out
for
the
white
men
's
*NL*
ship
,
which
,
he
had
had
information
,
was
about
to
come
up
the
river
.
*NL*
He
minimised
its
strength
and
exhorted
him
to
oppose
its
passage
.
This
*NL*
double-dealing
answered
his
purpose
,
which
was
to
keep
the
Bugis
forces
*NL*
divided
and
to
weaken
them
by
fighting
.
On
the
other
hand
,
he
had
in
*NL*
the
course
of
that
day
sent
word
to
the
assembled
Bugis
chiefs
in
town
,
*NL*
assuring
them
that
he
was
trying
to
induce
the
invaders
to
retire
;
his
*NL*
messages
to
the
fort
asked
earnestly
for
powder
for
the
Rajah
's
men
.
It
*NL*
was
a
long
time
since
Tunku
Allang
had
had
ammunition
for
the
score
or
*NL*
so
of
old
muskets
rusting
in
their
arm-racks
in
the
audience-hall
.
*NL*
The
open
intercourse
between
the
hill
and
the
palace
unsettled
all
the
*NL*
minds
.
It
was
already
time
for
men
to
take
sides
,
it
began
to
be
said
.
*NL*
There
would
soon
be
much
bloodshed
,
and
thereafter
great
trouble
for
*NL*
many
people
.
The
social
fabric
of
orderly
,
peaceful
life
,
when
every
man
*NL*
was
sure
of
to-morrow
,
the
edifice
raised
by
Jim
's
hands
,
seemed
on
that
*NL*
evening
ready
to
collapse
into
a
ruin
reeking
with
blood
.
The
poorer
*NL*
folk
were
already
taking
to
the
bush
or
flying
up
the
river
.
A
good
many
*NL*
of
the
upper
class
judged
it
necessary
to
go
and
pay
their
court
to
the
*NL*
Rajah
.
The
Rajah
's
youths
jostled
them
rudely
.
Old
Tunku
Allang
,
almost
*NL*
out
of
his
mind
with
fear
and
indecision
,
either
kept
a
sullen
silence
*NL*
or
abused
them
violently
for
daring
to
come
with
empty
hands
:
they
*NL*
departed
very
much
frightened
;
only
old
Doramin
kept
his
countrymen
*NL*
together
and
pursued
his
tactics
inflexibly
.
Enthroned
in
a
big
chair
*NL*
behind
the
improvised
stockade
,
he
issued
his
orders
in
a
deep
veiled
*NL*
rumble
,
unmoved
,
like
a
deaf
man
,
in
the
flying
rumours
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Dusk
fell
,
hiding
first
the
body
of
the
dead
man
,
which
had
been
left
*NL*
lying
with
arms
outstretched
as
if
nailed
to
the
ground
,
and
then
the
*NL*
revolving
sphere
of
the
night
rolled
smoothly
over
Patusan
and
came
to
*NL*
a
rest
,
showering
the
glitter
of
countless
worlds
upon
the
earth
.
Again
,
*NL*
in
the
exposed
part
of
the
town
big
fires
blazed
along
the
only
street
,
*NL*
revealing
from
distance
to
distance
upon
their
glares
the
falling
*NL*
straight
lines
of
roofs
,
the
fragments
of
wattled
walls
jumbled
in
*NL*
confusion
,
here
and
there
a
whole
hut
elevated
in
the
glow
upon
the
*NL*
vertical
black
stripes
of
a
group
of
high
piles
and
all
this
line
of
*NL*
dwellings
,
revealed
in
patches
by
the
swaying
flames
,
seemed
to
flicker
*NL*
tortuously
away
up-river
into
the
gloom
at
the
heart
of
the
land
.
A
*NL*
great
silence
,
in
which
the
looms
of
successive
fires
played
without
*NL*
noise
,
extended
into
the
darkness
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
;
but
the
*NL*
other
bank
of
the
river
,
all
dark
save
for
a
solitary
bonfire
at
the
*NL*
river-front
before
the
fort
,
sent
out
into
the
air
an
increasing
tremor
*NL*
that
might
have
been
the
stamping
of
a
multitude
of
feet
,
the
hum
of
*NL*
many
voices
,
or
the
fall
of
an
immensely
distant
waterfall
.
It
was
*NL*
then
,
Brown
confessed
to
me
,
while
,
turning
his
back
on
his
men
,
he
sat
*NL*
looking
at
it
all
,
that
notwithstanding
his
disdain
,
his
ruthless
faith
*NL*
in
himself
,
a
feeling
came
over
him
that
at
last
he
had
run
his
head
*NL*
against
a
stone
wall
.
Had
his
boat
been
afloat
at
the
time
,
he
believed
*NL*
he
would
have
tried
to
steal
away
,
taking
his
chances
of
a
long
chase
*NL*
down
the
river
and
of
starvation
at
sea
.
It
is
very
doubtful
whether
he
*NL*
would
have
succeeded
in
getting
away
.
However
,
he
did
n't
try
this
.
For
*NL*
another
moment
he
had
a
passing
thought
of
trying
to
rush
the
town
,
*NL*
but
he
perceived
very
well
that
in
the
end
he
would
find
himself
in
the
*NL*
lighted
street
,
where
they
would
be
shot
down
like
dogs
from
the
houses
.
*NL*
They
were
two
hundred
to
one
--
he
thought
,
while
his
men
,
huddling
round
*NL*
two
heaps
of
smouldering
embers
,
munched
the
last
of
the
bananas
and
*NL*
roasted
the
few
yams
they
owed
to
Kassim
's
diplomacy
.
Cornelius
sat
*NL*
amongst
them
dozing
sulkily
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
one
of
the
whites
remembered
that
some
tobacco
had
been
left
in
*NL*
the
boat
,
and
,
encouraged
by
the
impunity
of
the
Solomon
Islander
,
*NL*
said
he
would
go
to
fetch
it
.
At
this
all
the
others
shook
off
*NL*
their
despondency
.
Brown
applied
to
,
said
,
``
Go
,
and
be
d
--
d
to
you
,
''
*NL*
scornfully
.
He
did
n't
think
there
was
any
danger
in
going
to
the
creek
*NL*
in
the
dark
.
The
man
threw
a
leg
over
the
tree-trunk
and
disappeared
.
A
*NL*
moment
later
he
was
heard
clambering
into
the
boat
and
then
clambering
*NL*
out
.
``
I
've
got
it
,
''
he
cried
.
A
flash
and
a
report
at
the
very
foot
of
*NL*
the
hill
followed
.
``
I
am
hit
,
''
yelled
the
man
.
``
Look
out
,
look
out
--
I
am
*NL*
hit
,
''
and
instantly
all
the
rifles
went
off
.
The
hill
squirted
fire
*NL*
and
noise
into
the
night
like
a
little
volcano
,
and
when
Brown
and
*NL*
the
Yankee
with
curses
and
cuffs
stopped
the
panic-stricken
firing
,
a
*NL*
profound
,
weary
groan
floated
up
from
the
creek
,
succeeded
by
a
plaint
*NL*
whose
heartrending
sadness
was
like
some
poison
turning
the
blood
*NL*
cold
in
the
veins
.
Then
a
strong
voice
pronounced
several
distinct
*NL*
incomprehensible
words
somewhere
beyond
the
creek
.
``
Let
no
one
fire
,
''
*NL*
shouted
Brown
.
``
What
does
it
mean
?
''
...
``
Do
you
hear
on
the
hill
?
*NL*
Do
you
hear
?
Do
you
hear
?
''
repeated
the
voice
three
times
.
Cornelius
*NL*
translated
,
and
then
prompted
the
answer
.
``
Speak
,
''
cried
Brown
,
``
we
*NL*
hear
.
''
Then
the
voice
,
declaiming
in
the
sonorous
inflated
tone
of
a
*NL*
herald
,
and
shifting
continually
on
the
edge
of
the
vague
waste-land
,
*NL*
proclaimed
that
between
the
men
of
the
Bugis
nation
living
in
Patusan
*NL*
and
the
white
men
on
the
hill
and
those
with
them
,
there
would
be
no
*NL*
faith
,
no
compassion
,
no
speech
,
no
peace
.
A
bush
rustled
;
a
haphazard
*NL*
volley
rang
out
.
``
Dam
'
foolishness
,
''
muttered
the
Yankee
,
vexedly
*NL*
grounding
the
butt
.
Cornelius
translated
.
The
wounded
man
below
*NL*
the
hill
,
after
crying
out
twice
,
``
Take
me
up
!
take
me
up
!
''
went
on
*NL*
complaining
in
moans
.
While
he
had
kept
on
the
blackened
earth
of
the
*NL*
slope
,
and
afterwards
crouching
in
the
boat
,
he
had
been
safe
enough
.
*NL*
It
seems
that
in
his
joy
at
finding
the
tobacco
he
forgot
himself
and
*NL*
jumped
out
on
her
off-side
,
as
it
were
.
The
white
boat
,
lying
high
and
*NL*
dry
,
showed
him
up
;
the
creek
was
no
more
than
seven
yards
wide
in
that
*NL*
place
,
and
there
happened
to
be
a
man
crouching
in
the
bush
on
the
other
*NL*
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
was
a
Bugis
of
Tondano
only
lately
come
to
Patusan
,
and
a
relation
*NL*
of
the
man
shot
in
the
afternoon
.
That
famous
long
shot
had
indeed
*NL*
appalled
the
beholders
.
The
man
in
utter
security
had
been
struck
down
,
*NL*
in
full
view
of
his
friends
,
dropping
with
a
joke
on
his
lips
,
and
they
*NL*
seemed
to
see
in
the
act
an
atrocity
which
had
stirred
a
bitter
rage
.
*NL*
That
relation
of
his
,
Si-Lapa
by
name
,
was
then
with
Doramin
in
the
*NL*
stockade
only
a
few
feet
away
.
You
who
know
these
chaps
must
admit
that
*NL*
the
fellow
showed
an
unusual
pluck
by
volunteering
to
carry
the
message
,
*NL*
alone
,
in
the
dark
.
Creeping
across
the
open
ground
,
he
had
deviated
*NL*
to
the
left
and
found
himself
opposite
the
boat
.
He
was
startled
when
*NL*
Brown
's
man
shouted
.
He
came
to
a
sitting
position
with
his
gun
to
his
*NL*
shoulder
,
and
when
the
other
jumped
out
,
exposing
himself
,
he
pulled
the
*NL*
trigger
and
lodged
three
jagged
slugs
point-blank
into
the
poor
wretch
's
*NL*
stomach
.
Then
,
lying
flat
on
his
face
,
he
gave
himself
up
for
dead
,
*NL*
while
a
thin
hail
of
lead
chopped
and
swished
the
bushes
close
on
his
*NL*
right
hand
;
afterwards
he
delivered
his
speech
shouting
,
bent
double
,
*NL*
dodging
all
the
time
in
cover
.
With
the
last
word
he
leaped
sideways
,
*NL*
lay
close
for
a
while
,
and
afterwards
got
back
to
the
houses
unharmed
,
*NL*
having
achieved
on
that
night
such
a
renown
as
his
children
will
not
*NL*
willingly
allow
to
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
on
the
hill
the
forlorn
band
let
the
two
little
heaps
of
embers
*NL*
go
out
under
their
bowed
heads
.
They
sat
dejected
on
the
ground
with
*NL*
compressed
lips
and
downcast
eyes
,
listening
to
their
comrade
below
.
He
*NL*
was
a
strong
man
and
died
hard
,
with
moans
now
loud
,
now
sinking
to
a
*NL*
strange
confidential
note
of
pain
.
Sometimes
he
shrieked
,
and
again
,
*NL*
after
a
period
of
silence
,
he
could
be
heard
muttering
deliriously
a
*NL*
long
and
unintelligible
complaint
.
Never
for
a
moment
did
he
cease
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
What
's
the
good
?
''
Brown
had
said
unmoved
once
,
seeing
the
Yankee
,
who
*NL*
had
been
swearing
under
his
breath
,
prepare
to
go
down
.
``
That
's
so
,
''
*NL*
assented
the
deserter
,
reluctantly
desisting
.
``
There
's
no
encouragement
*NL*
for
wounded
men
here
.
Only
his
noise
is
calculated
to
make
all
the
*NL*
others
think
too
much
of
the
hereafter
,
cap'n
.
''
``
Water
!
''
cried
the
*NL*
wounded
man
in
an
extraordinarily
clear
vigorous
voice
,
and
then
went
*NL*
off
moaning
feebly
.
``
Ay
,
water
.
Water
will
do
it
,
''
muttered
the
other
to
*NL*
himself
,
resignedly
.
``
Plenty
by-and-by
.
The
tide
is
flowing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
last
the
tide
flowed
,
silencing
the
plaint
and
the
cries
of
pain
,
*NL*
and
the
dawn
was
near
when
Brown
,
sitting
with
his
chin
in
the
palm
of
*NL*
his
hand
before
Patusan
,
as
one
might
stare
at
the
unscalable
side
of
a
*NL*
mountain
,
heard
the
brief
ringing
bark
of
a
brass
6-pounder
far
away
*NL*
in
town
somewhere
.
``
What
's
this
?
''
he
asked
of
Cornelius
,
who
hung
about
*NL*
him
.
Cornelius
listened
.
A
muffled
roaring
shout
rolled
down-river
over
*NL*
the
town
;
a
big
drum
began
to
throb
,
and
others
responded
,
pulsating
and
*NL*
droning
.
Tiny
scattered
lights
began
to
twinkle
in
the
dark
half
of
the
*NL*
town
,
while
the
part
lighted
by
the
loom
of
fires
hummed
with
a
deep
and
*NL*
prolonged
murmur
.
``
He
has
come
,
''
said
Cornelius
.
``
What
?
Already
?
Are
*NL*
you
sure
?
''
Brown
asked
.
``
Yes
!
yes
!
Sure
.
Listen
to
the
noise
.
''
``
What
*NL*
are
they
making
that
row
about
?
''
pursued
Brown
.
``
For
joy
,
''
snorted
*NL*
Cornelius
;
``
he
is
a
very
great
man
,
but
all
the
same
,
he
knows
no
more
*NL*
than
a
child
,
and
so
they
make
a
great
noise
to
please
him
,
because
they
*NL*
know
no
better
.
''
``
Look
here
,
''
said
Brown
,
``
how
is
one
to
get
at
him
?
''
*NL*
``
He
shall
come
to
talk
to
you
,
''
Cornelius
declared
.
``
What
do
you
mean
?
*NL*
Come
down
here
strolling
as
it
were
?
''
Cornelius
nodded
vigorously
in
the
*NL*
dark
.
``
Yes
.
He
will
come
straight
here
and
talk
to
you
.
He
is
just
like
*NL*
a
fool
.
You
shall
see
what
a
fool
he
is
.
''
Brown
was
incredulous
.
``
You
*NL*
shall
see
;
you
shall
see
,
''
repeated
Cornelius
.
``
He
is
not
afraid
--
not
*NL*
afraid
of
anything
.
He
will
come
and
order
you
to
leave
his
people
*NL*
alone
.
Everybody
must
leave
his
people
alone
.
He
is
like
a
little
child
.
*NL*
He
will
come
to
you
straight
.
''
Alas
!
he
knew
Jim
well
--
that
``
mean
little
*NL*
skunk
,
''
as
Brown
called
him
to
me
.
``
Yes
,
certainly
,
''
he
pursued
with
*NL*
ardour
,
``
and
then
,
captain
,
you
tell
that
tall
man
with
a
gun
to
shoot
*NL*
him
.
Just
you
kill
him
,
and
you
will
frighten
everybody
so
much
that
*NL*
you
can
do
anything
you
like
with
them
afterwards
--
get
what
you
like
--
go
*NL*
away
when
you
like
.
Ha
!
ha
!
ha
!
Fine
...
''
He
almost
danced
with
*NL*
impatience
and
eagerness
;
and
Brown
,
looking
over
his
shoulder
at
him
,
*NL*
could
see
,
shown
up
by
the
pitiless
dawn
,
his

CHAPTER
41
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
To
the
very
last
moment
,
till
the
full
day
came
upon
them
with
a
*NL*
spring
,
the
fires
on
the
west
bank
blazed
bright
and
clear
;
and
then
*NL*
Brown
saw
in
a
knot
of
coloured
figures
motionless
between
the
advanced
*NL*
houses
a
man
in
European
clothes
,
in
a
helmet
,
all
white
.
``
That
's
him
;
*NL*
look
!
look
!
''
Cornelius
said
excitedly
.
All
Brown
's
men
had
sprung
up
and
*NL*
crowded
at
his
back
with
lustreless
eyes
.
The
group
of
vivid
colours
*NL*
and
dark
faces
with
the
white
figure
in
their
midst
were
observing
the
*NL*
knoll
.
Brown
could
see
naked
arms
being
raised
to
shade
the
eyes
and
*NL*
other
brown
arms
pointing
.
What
should
he
do
?
He
looked
around
,
and
the
*NL*
forests
that
faced
him
on
all
sides
walled
the
cock-pit
of
an
unequal
*NL*
contest
.
He
looked
once
more
at
his
men
.
A
contempt
,
a
weariness
,
the
*NL*
desire
of
life
,
the
wish
to
try
for
one
more
chance
--
for
some
other
*NL*
grave
--
struggled
in
his
breast
.
From
the
outline
the
figure
presented
*NL*
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
white
man
there
,
backed
up
by
all
the
power
of
*NL*
the
land
,
was
examining
his
position
through
binoculars
.
Brown
jumped
up
*NL*
on
the
log
,
throwing
his
arms
up
,
the
palms
outwards
.
The
coloured
group
*NL*
closed
round
the
white
man
,
and
fell
back
twice
before
he
got
clear
of
*NL*
them
,
walking
slowly
alone
.
Brown
remained
standing
on
the
log
till
*NL*
Jim
,
appearing
and
disappearing
between
the
patches
of
thorny
scrub
,
had
*NL*
nearly
reached
the
creek
;
then
Brown
jumped
off
and
went
down
to
meet
*NL*
him
on
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
They
met
,
I
should
think
,
not
very
far
from
the
place
,
perhaps
on
the
*NL*
very
spot
,
where
Jim
took
the
second
desperate
leap
of
his
life
--
the
*NL*
leap
that
landed
him
into
the
life
of
Patusan
,
into
the
trust
,
the
love
,
*NL*
the
confidence
of
the
people
.
They
faced
each
other
across
the
creek
,
*NL*
and
with
steady
eyes
tried
to
understand
each
other
before
they
opened
*NL*
their
lips
.
Their
antagonism
must
have
been
expressed
in
their
glances
;
*NL*
I
know
that
Brown
hated
Jim
at
first
sight
.
Whatever
hopes
he
might
have
*NL*
had
vanished
at
once
.
This
was
not
the
man
he
had
expected
to
see
.
He
*NL*
hated
him
for
this
--
and
in
a
checked
flannel
shirt
with
sleeves
cut
*NL*
off
at
the
elbows
,
grey
bearded
,
with
a
sunken
,
sun-blackened
face
--
he
*NL*
cursed
in
his
heart
the
other
's
youth
and
assurance
,
his
clear
eyes
and
*NL*
his
untroubled
bearing
.
That
fellow
had
got
in
a
long
way
before
him
!
*NL*
He
did
not
look
like
a
man
who
would
be
willing
to
give
anything
for
*NL*
assistance
.
He
had
all
the
advantages
on
his
side
--
possession
,
security
,
*NL*
power
;
he
was
on
the
side
of
an
overwhelming
force
!
He
was
not
hungry
*NL*
and
desperate
,
and
he
did
not
seem
in
the
least
afraid
.
And
there
was
*NL*
something
in
the
very
neatness
of
Jim
's
clothes
,
from
the
white
helmet
*NL*
to
the
canvas
leggings
and
the
pipeclayed
shoes
,
which
in
Brown
's
sombre
*NL*
irritated
eyes
seemed
to
belong
to
things
he
had
in
the
very
shaping
of
*NL*
his
life
condemned
and
flouted
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Who
are
you
?
''
asked
Jim
at
last
,
speaking
in
his
usual
voice
.
``
My
*NL*
name
's
Brown
,
''
answered
the
other
loudly
;
``
Captain
Brown
.
What
's
yours
?
''
*NL*
and
Jim
after
a
little
pause
went
on
quietly
,
as
If
he
had
not
heard
:
*NL*
``
What
made
you
come
here
?
''
``
You
want
to
know
,
''
said
Brown
bitterly
.
*NL*
``
It
's
easy
to
tell
.
Hunger
.
And
what
made
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
The
fellow
started
at
this
,
''
said
Brown
,
relating
to
me
the
opening
of
*NL*
this
strange
conversation
between
those
two
men
,
separated
only
by
*NL*
the
muddy
bed
of
a
creek
,
but
standing
on
the
opposite
poles
of
that
*NL*
conception
of
life
which
includes
all
mankind
--
``
The
fellow
started
at
*NL*
this
and
got
very
red
in
the
face
.
Too
big
to
be
questioned
,
I
suppose
.
*NL*
I
told
him
that
if
he
looked
upon
me
as
a
dead
man
with
whom
you
may
*NL*
take
liberties
,
he
himself
was
not
a
whit
better
off
really
.
I
had
*NL*
a
fellow
up
there
who
had
a
bead
drawn
on
him
all
the
time
,
and
only
*NL*
waited
for
a
sign
from
me
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
shocked
at
in
this
.
*NL*
He
had
come
down
of
his
own
free
will
.
`
Let
us
agree
,
'
said
I
,
`
that
we
*NL*
are
both
dead
men
,
and
let
us
talk
on
that
basis
,
as
equals
.
We
are
*NL*
all
equal
before
death
,
'
I
said
.
I
admitted
I
was
there
like
a
rat
in
*NL*
a
trap
,
but
we
had
been
driven
to
it
,
and
even
a
trapped
rat
can
give
*NL*
a
bite
.
He
caught
me
up
in
a
moment
.
`
Not
if
you
do
n't
go
near
the
trap
*NL*
till
the
rat
is
dead
.
'
I
told
him
that
sort
of
game
was
good
enough
for
*NL*
these
native
friends
of
his
,
but
I
would
have
thought
him
too
white
to
*NL*
serve
even
a
rat
so
.
Yes
,
I
had
wanted
to
talk
with
him
.
Not
to
beg
*NL*
for
my
life
,
though
.
My
fellows
were
--
well
--
what
they
were
--
men
like
*NL*
himself
,
anyhow
.
All
we
wanted
from
him
was
to
come
on
in
the
devil
's
*NL*
name
and
have
it
out
.
`
God
d
--
n
it
,
'
said
I
,
while
he
stood
there
as
*NL*
still
as
a
wooden
post
,
`
you
do
n't
want
to
come
out
here
every
day
with
*NL*
your
glasses
to
count
how
many
of
us
are
left
on
our
feet
.
Come
.
Either
*NL*
bring
your
infernal
crowd
along
or
let
us
go
out
and
starve
in
the
open
*NL*
sea
,
by
God
!
You
have
been
white
once
,
for
all
your
tall
talk
of
this
*NL*
being
your
own
people
and
you
being
one
with
them
.
Are
you
?
And
what
the
*NL*
devil
do
you
get
for
it
;
what
is
it
you
've
found
here
that
is
so
d
--
d
*NL*
precious
?
Hey
?
You
do
n't
want
us
to
come
down
here
perhaps
--
do
you
?
You
*NL*
are
two
hundred
to
one
.
You
do
n't
want
us
to
come
down
into
the
open
.
*NL*
Ah
!
I
promise
you
we
shall
give
you
some
sport
before
you
've
done
.
You
*NL*
talk
about
me
making
a
cowardly
set
upon
unoffending
people
.
What
's
*NL*
that
to
me
that
they
are
unoffending
,
when
I
am
starving
for
next
to
no
*NL*
offence
?
But
I
am
not
a
coward
.
Do
n't
you
be
one
.
Bring
them
along
or
,
*NL*
by
all
the
fiends
,
we
shall
yet
manage
to
send
half
your
unoffending
*NL*
town
to
heaven
with
us
in
smoke
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
He
was
terrible
--
relating
this
to
me
--
this
tortured
skeleton
of
a
man
*NL*
drawn
up
together
with
his
face
over
his
knees
,
upon
a
miserable
bed
in
*NL*
that
wretched
hovel
,
and
lifting
his
head
to
look
at
me
with
malignant
*NL*
triumph
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
That
's
what
I
told
him
--
I
knew
what
to
say
,
''
he
began
again
,
feebly
*NL*
at
first
,
but
working
himself
up
with
incredible
speed
into
a
fiery
*NL*
utterance
of
his
scorn
.
``
We
are
n't
going
into
the
forest
to
wander
like
*NL*
a
string
of
living
skeletons
dropping
one
after
another
for
ants
to
*NL*
go
to
work
upon
us
before
we
are
fairly
dead
.
Oh
no
!
...
`
You
do
n't
*NL*
deserve
a
better
fate
,
'
he
said
.
`
And
what
do
you
deserve
,
'
I
shouted
*NL*
at
him
,
`
you
that
I
find
skulking
here
with
your
mouth
full
of
your
*NL*
responsibility
,
of
innocent
lives
,
of
your
infernal
duty
?
What
do
*NL*
you
know
more
of
me
than
I
know
of
you
?
I
came
here
for
food
.
D'ye
*NL*
hear
?
--
food
to
fill
our
bellies
.
And
what
did
_
you
_
come
for
?
What
did
*NL*
you
ask
for
when
you
came
here
?
We
do
n't
ask
you
for
anything
but
to
*NL*
give
us
a
fight
or
a
clear
road
to
go
back
whence
we
came
...
'
'
I
*NL*
would
fight
with
you
now
,
'
says
he
,
pulling
at
his
little
moustache
.
*NL*
`
And
I
would
let
you
shoot
me
,
and
welcome
,
'
I
said
.
`
This
is
as
good
a
*NL*
jumping-off
place
for
me
as
another
.
I
am
sick
of
my
infernal
luck
.
But
*NL*
it
would
be
too
easy
.
There
are
my
men
in
the
same
boat
--
and
,
by
God
,
I
*NL*
am
not
the
sort
to
jump
out
of
trouble
and
leave
them
in
a
d
--
d
lurch
,
'
*NL*
I
said
.
He
stood
thinking
for
a
while
and
then
wanted
to
know
what
I
*NL*
had
done
-LRB-
`
out
there
'
he
says
,
tossing
his
head
down-stream
-RRB-
to
be
hazed
*NL*
about
so
.
`
Have
we
met
to
tell
each
other
the
story
of
our
lives
?
'
I
*NL*
asked
him
.
`
Suppose
you
begin
.
No
?
Well
,
I
am
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
hear
.
*NL*
Keep
it
to
yourself
.
I
know
it
is
no
better
than
mine
.
I
've
lived
--
and
*NL*
so
did
you
,
though
you
talk
as
if
you
were
one
of
those
people
that
*NL*
should
have
wings
so
as
to
go
about
without
touching
the
dirty
earth
.
*NL*
Well
--
it
is
dirty
.
I
have
n't
got
any
wings
.
I
am
here
because
I
was
*NL*
afraid
once
in
my
life
.
Want
to
know
what
of
?
Of
a
prison
.
That
scares
*NL*
me
,
and
you
may
know
it
--
if
it
's
any
good
to
you
.
I
wo
n't
ask
you
what
*NL*
scared
you
into
this
infernal
hole
,
where
you
seem
to
have
found
pretty
*NL*
pickings
.
That
's
your
luck
and
this
is
mine
--
the
privilege
to
beg
for
*NL*
the
favour
of
being
shot
quickly
,
or
else
kicked
out
to
go
free
and
*NL*
starve
in
my
own
way
.
'
...
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
debilitated
body
shook
with
an
exultation
so
vehement
,
so
assured
,
*NL*
and
so
malicious
that
it
seemed
to
have
driven
off
the
death
waiting
for
*NL*
him
in
that
hut
.
The
corpse
of
his
mad
self-love
uprose
from
rags
and
*NL*
destitution
as
from
the
dark
horrors
of
a
tomb
.
It
is
impossible
to
say
*NL*
how
much
he
lied
to
Jim
then
,
how
much
he
lied
to
me
now
--
and
to
himself
*NL*
always
.
Vanity
plays
lurid
tricks
with
our
memory
,
and
the
truth
of
*NL*
every
passion
wants
some
pretence
to
make
it
live
.
Standing
at
the
gate
*NL*
of
the
other
world
in
the
guise
of
a
beggar
,
he
had
slapped
this
world
's
*NL*
face
,
he
had
spat
on
it
,
he
had
thrown
upon
it
an
immensity
of
scorn
*NL*
and
revolt
at
the
bottom
of
his
misdeeds
.
He
had
overcome
them
all
--
men
,
*NL*
women
,
savages
,
traders
,
ruffians
,
missionaries
--
and
Jim
--
``
that
*NL*
beefy-faced
beggar
.
''
I
did
not
begrudge
him
this
triumph
in
articulo
*NL*
mortis
,
this
almost
posthumous
illusion
of
having
trampled
all
the
earth
*NL*
under
his
feet
.
While
he
was
boasting
to
me
,
in
his
sordid
and
repulsive
*NL*
agony
,
I
could
n't
help
thinking
of
the
chuckling
talk
relating
to
the
*NL*
time
of
his
greatest
splendour
when
,
during
a
year
or
more
,
Gentleman
*NL*
Brown
's
ship
was
to
be
seen
,
for
many
days
on
end
,
hovering
off
an
islet
*NL*
befringed
with
green
upon
azure
,
with
the
dark
dot
of
the
mission-house
*NL*
on
a
white
beach
;
while
Gentleman
Brown
,
ashore
,
was
casting
his
spells
*NL*
over
a
romantic
girl
for
whom
Melanesia
had
been
too
much
,
and
giving
*NL*
hopes
of
a
remarkable
conversion
to
her
husband
.
The
poor
man
,
some
time
*NL*
or
other
,
had
been
heard
to
express
the
intention
of
winning
``
Captain
*NL*
Brown
to
a
better
way
of
life
.
''
...
``
Bag
Gentleman
Brown
for
*NL*
Glory
''
--
as
a
leery-eyed
loafer
expressed
it
once
--
``
just
to
let
them
see
*NL*
up
above
what
a
Western
Pacific
trading
skipper
looks
like
.
''
And
this
*NL*
was
the
man
,
too
,
who
had
run
off
with
a
dying
woman
,
and
had
shed
tears
*NL*
over
her
body
.
``
Carried
on
like
a
big
baby
,
''
his
then
mate
was
never
*NL*
tired
of
telling
,
``
and
where
the
fun
came
in
may
I
be
kicked
to
death
by
*NL*
diseased
Kanakas
if
_
I

know
.
Why
,
gents
!
she
was
too
far
gone
when
he
*NL*
brought
her
aboard
to
know
him
;
she
just
lay
there
on
her
back
in
his
*NL*
bunk
staring
at
the
beam
with
awful
shining
eyes
--
and
then
she
died
.
*NL*
Dam
'
bad
sort
of
fever
,
I
guess
...
''
I
remembered
all
these
stories
*NL*
while
,
wiping
his
matted
lump
of
a
beard
with
a
livid
hand
,
he
was
*NL*
telling
me
from
his
noisome
couch
how
he
got
round
,
got
in
,
got
home
,
*NL*
on
that
confounded
,
immaculate

n't

He
*NL*
admitted
that
he
could
n't
be
scared
,
but
there
was
a
way
,
``
as
broad
as
*NL*
a
turnpike
,
to
get
in
and
shake
his
twopenny
soul
around
and
inside
out
*NL*
and
upside
down
--
by
God
!

CHAPTER
42
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
he
could
do
more
than
perhaps
look
upon
that
straight
*NL*
path
.
He
seemed
to
have
been
puzzled
by
what
he
saw
,
for
he
interrupted
*NL*
himself
in
his
narrative
more
than
once
to
exclaim
,
``
He
nearly
slipped
*NL*
from
me
there
.
I
could
not
make
him
out
.
Who
was
he
?
''
And
after
*NL*
glaring
at
me
wildly
he
would
go
on
,
jubilating
and
sneering
.
To
me
the
*NL*
conversation
of
these
two
across
the
creek
appears
now
as
the
deadliest
*NL*
kind
of
duel
on
which
Fate
looked
on
with
her
cold-eyed
knowledge
of
the
*NL*
end
.
No
,
he
did
n't
turn
Jim
's
soul
inside
out
,
but
I
am
much
mistaken
if
*NL*
the
spirit
so
utterly
out
of
his
reach
had
not
been
made
to
taste
to
the
*NL*
full
the
bitterness
of
that
contest
.
These
were
the
emissaries
with
whom
*NL*
the
world
he
had
renounced
was
pursuing
him
in
his
retreat
--
white
men
*NL*
from
``
out
there
''
where
he
did
not
think
himself
good
enough
to
live
.
*NL*
This
was
all
that
came
to
him
--
a
menace
,
a
shock
,
a
danger
to
his
*NL*
work
.
I
suppose
it
is
this
sad
,
half-resentful
,
half-resigned
feeling
,
*NL*
piercing
through
the
few
words
Jim
said
now
and
then
,
that
puzzled
Brown
*NL*
so
much
in
the
reading
of
his
character
.
Some
great
men
owe
most
of
*NL*
their
greatness
to
the
ability
of
detecting
in
those
they
destine
for
*NL*
their
tools
the
exact
quality
of
strength
that
matters
for
their
work
;
*NL*
and
Brown
,
as
though
he
had
been
really
great
,
had
a
satanic
gift
of
*NL*
finding
out
the
best
and
the
weakest
spot
in
his
victims
.
He
admitted
*NL*
to
me
that
Jim
was
n't
of
the
sort
that
can
be
got
over
by
truckling
,
and
*NL*
accordingly
he
took
care
to
show
himself
as
a
man
confronting
without
*NL*
dismay
ill-luck
,
censure
,
and
disaster
.
The
smuggling
of
a
few
guns
was
*NL*
no
great
crime
,
he
pointed
out
.
As
to
coming
to
Patusan
,
who
had
the
*NL*
right
to
say
he
had
n't
come
to
beg
?
The
infernal
people
here
let
loose
*NL*
at
him
from
both
banks
without
staying
to
ask
questions
.
He
made
*NL*
the
point
brazenly
,
for
,
in
truth
,
Dain
Waris
's
energetic
action
had
*NL*
prevented
the
greatest
calamities
;
because
Brown
told
me
distinctly
*NL*
that
,
perceiving
the
size
of
the
place
,
he
had
resolved
instantly
in
his
*NL*
mind
that
as
soon
as
he
had
gained
a
footing
he
would
set
fire
right
and
*NL*
left
,
and
begin
by
shooting
down
everything
living
in
sight
,
in
order
to
*NL*
cow
and
terrify
the
population
.
The
disproportion
of
forces
was
so
great
*NL*
that
this
was
the
only
way
giving
him
the
slightest
chance
of
attaining
*NL*
his
ends
--
he
argued
in
a
fit
of
coughing
.
But
he
did
n't
tell
Jim
this
.
*NL*
As
to
the
hardships
and
starvation
they
had
gone
through
,
these
had
been
*NL*
very
real
;
it
was
enough
to
look
at
his
band
.
He
made
,
at
the
sound
of
a
*NL*
shrill
whistle
,
all
his
men
appear
standing
in
a
row
on
the
logs
in
full
*NL*
view
,
so
that
Jim
could
see
them
.
For
the
killing
of
the
man
,
it
had
*NL*
been
done
--
well
,
it
had
--
but
was
not
this
war
,
bloody
war
--
in
a
corner
?
*NL*
and
the
fellow
had
been
killed
cleanly
,
shot
through
the
chest
,
not
like
*NL*
that
poor
devil
of
his
lying
now
in
the
creek
.
They
had
to
listen
to
him
*NL*
dying
for
six
hours
,
with
his
entrails
torn
with
slugs
.
At
any
rate
this
*NL*
was
a
life
for
a
life
...
And
all
this
was
said
with
the
weariness
,
*NL*
with
the
recklessness
of
a
man
spurred
on
and
on
by
ill-luck
till
he
*NL*
cares
not
where
he
runs
.
When
he
asked
Jim
,
with
a
sort
of
brusque
*NL*
despairing
frankness
,
whether
he
himself
--
straight
now
--
did
n't
*NL*
understand
that
when
``
it
came
to
saving
one
's
life
in
the
dark
,
one
*NL*
did
n't
care
who
else
went
--
three
,
thirty
,
three
hundred
people
''
--
it
was
*NL*
as
if
a
demon
had
been
whispering
advice
in
his
ear
.
``
I
made
him
wince
,
''
*NL*
boasted
Brown
to
me
.
``
He
very
soon
left
off
coming
the
righteous
over
*NL*
me
.
He
just
stood
there
with
nothing
to
say
,
and
looking
as
black
as
*NL*
thunder
--
not
at
me
--
on
the
ground
.
''
He
asked
Jim
whether
he
had
nothing
*NL*
fishy
in
his
life
to
remember
that
he
was
so
damnedly
hard
upon
a
man
*NL*
trying
to
get
out
of
a
deadly
hole
by
the
first
means
that
came
to
*NL*
hand
--
and
so
on
,
and
so
on
.
And
there
ran
through
the
rough
talk
a
*NL*
vein
of
subtle
reference
to
their
common
blood
,
an
assumption
of
common
*NL*
experience
;
a
sickening
suggestion
of
common
guilt
,
of
secret
knowledge
*NL*
that
was
like
a
bond
of
their
minds
and
of
their
hearts
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
At
last
Brown
threw
himself
down
full
length
and
watched
Jim
out
of
*NL*
the
corners
of
his
eyes
.
Jim
on
his
side
of
the
creek
stood
thinking
and
*NL*
switching
his
leg
.
The
houses
in
view
were
silent
,
as
if
a
pestilence
*NL*
had
swept
them
clean
of
every
breath
of
life
;
but
many
invisible
eyes
*NL*
were
turned
,
from
within
,
upon
the
two
men
with
the
creek
between
them
,
*NL*
a
stranded
white
boat
,
and
the
body
of
the
third
man
half
sunk
in
the
*NL*
mud
.
On
the
river
canoes
were
moving
again
,
for
Patusan
was
recovering
*NL*
its
belief
in
the
stability
of
earthly
institutions
since
the
return
of
*NL*
the
white
lord
.
The
right
bank
,
the
platforms
of
the
houses
,
the
rafts
*NL*
moored
along
the
shores
,
even
the
roofs
of
bathing-huts
,
were
covered
*NL*
with
people
that
,
far
away
out
of
earshot
and
almost
out
of
sight
,
were
*NL*
straining
their
eyes
towards
the
knoll
beyond
the
Rajah
's
stockade
.
*NL*
Within
the
wide
irregular
ring
of
forests
,
broken
in
two
places
by
the
*NL*
sheen
of
the
river
,
there
was
a
silence
.
``
Will
you
promise
to
leave
the
*NL*
coast
?
''
Jim
asked
.
Brown
lifted
and
let
fall
his
hand
,
giving
everything
*NL*
up
as
it
were
--
accepting
the
inevitable
.
``
And
surrender
your
arms
?
''
Jim
*NL*
went
on
.
Brown
sat
up
and
glared
across
.
``
Surrender
our
arms
!
Not
till
*NL*
you
come
to
take
them
out
of
our
stiff
hands
.
You
think
I
am
gone
crazy
*NL*
with
funk
?
Oh
no
!
That
and
the
rags
I
stand
in
is
all
I
have
got
in
the
*NL*
world
,
besides
a
few
more
breechloaders
on
board
;
and
I
expect
to
sell
*NL*
the
lot
in
Madagascar
,
if
I
ever
get
so
far
--
begging
my
way
from
ship
to
*NL*
ship
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Jim
said
nothing
to
this
.
At
last
,
throwing
away
the
switch
he
held
in
*NL*
his
hand
,
he
said
,
as
if
speaking
to
himself
,
``
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
*NL*
have
the
power
.
''
...
``
You
do
n't
know
!
And
you
wanted
me
just
now
to
*NL*
give
up
my
arms
!
That
's
good
,
too
,
''
cried
Brown
;
``
Suppose
they
say
one
*NL*
thing
to
you
,
and
do
the
other
thing
to
me
.
''
He
calmed
down
markedly
.
``
I
*NL*
dare
say
you
have
the
power
,
or
what
's
the
meaning
of
all
this
talk
?
''
he
*NL*
continued
.
``
What
did
you
come
down
here
for
?
To
pass
the
time
of
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Jim
,
lifting
his
head
suddenly
after
a
long
silence
.
*NL*
``
You
shall
have
a
clear
road
or
else
a
clear
fight
.
''
He
turned
on
his
*NL*
heel
and
walked
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Brown
got
up
at
once
,
but
he
did
not
go
up
the
hill
till
he
had
seen
*NL*
Jim
disappear
between
the
first
houses
.
He
never
set
his
eyes
on
him
*NL*
again
.
On
his
way
back
he
met
Cornelius
slouching
down
with
his
head
*NL*
between
his
shoulders
.
He
stopped
before
Brown
.
``
Why
did
n't
you
kill
*NL*
him
?
''
he
demanded
in
a
sour
,
discontented
voice
.
``
Because
I
could
do
*NL*
better
than
that
,
''
Brown
said
with
an
amused
smile
.
``
Never
!
never
!
''
*NL*
protested
Cornelius
with
energy
.
``
Could
n't
.
I
have
lived
here
for
many
*NL*
years
.
''
Brown
looked
up
at
him
curiously
.
There
were
many
sides
to
the
*NL*
life
of
that
place
in
arms
against
him
;
things
he
would
never
find
out
.
*NL*
Cornelius
slunk
past
dejectedly
in
the
direction
of
the
river
.
He
was
*NL*
now
leaving
his
new
friends
;
he
accepted
the
disappointing
course
of
*NL*
events
with
a
sulky
obstinacy
which
seemed
to
draw
more
together
his
*NL*
little
yellow
old
face
;
and
as
he
went
down
he
glanced
askant
here
and
*NL*
there
,
never
giving
up
his
fixed
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Henceforth
events
move
fast
without
a
check
,
flowing
from
the
very
*NL*
hearts
of
men
like
a
stream
from
a
dark
source
,
and
we
see
Jim
amongst
*NL*
them
,
mostly
through
Tamb
'
Itam
's
eyes
.
The
girl
's
eyes
had
watched
him
*NL*
too
,
but
her
life
is
too
much
entwined
with
his
:
there
is
her
passion
,
*NL*
her
wonder
,
her
anger
,
and
,
above
all
,
her
fear
and
her
unforgiving
*NL*
love
.
Of
the
faithful
servant
,
uncomprehending
as
the
rest
of
them
,
it
*NL*
is
the
fidelity
alone
that
comes
into
play
;
a
fidelity
and
a
belief
in
*NL*
his
lord
so
strong
that
even
amazement
is
subdued
to
a
sort
of
saddened
*NL*
acceptance
of
a
mysterious
failure
.
He
has
eyes
only
for
one
figure
,
*NL*
and
through
all
the
mazes
of
bewilderment
he
preserves
his
air
of
*NL*
guardianship
,
of
obedience
,
of
care
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
His
master
came
back
from
his
talk
with
the
white
men
,
walking
slowly
*NL*
towards
the
stockade
in
the
street
.
Everybody
was
rejoiced
to
see
him
*NL*
return
,
for
while
he
was
away
every
man
had
been
afraid
not
only
of
him
*NL*
being
killed
,
but
also
of
what
would
come
after
.
Jim
went
into
one
of
*NL*
the
houses
,
where
old
Doramin
had
retired
,
and
remained
alone
for
a
*NL*
long
time
with
the
head
of
the
Bugis
settlers
.
No
doubt
he
discussed
*NL*
the
course
to
follow
with
him
then
,
but
no
man
was
present
at
the
*NL*
conversation
.
Only
Tamb
'
Itam
,
keeping
as
close
to
the
door
as
he
could
,
*NL*
heard
his
master
say
,
``
Yes
.
I
shall
let
all
the
people
know
that
such
*NL*
is
my
wish
;
but
I
spoke
to
you
,
O
Doramin
,
before
all
the
others
,
and
*NL*
alone
;
for
you
know
my
heart
as
well
as
I
know
yours
and
its
greatest
*NL*
desire
.
And
you
know
well
also
that
I
have
no
thought
but
for
the
*NL*
people
's
good
.
''
Then
his
master
,
lifting
the
sheeting
in
the
doorway
,
*NL*
went
out
,
and
he
,
Tamb
'
Itam
,
had
a
glimpse
of
old
Doramin
within
,
*NL*
sitting
in
the
chair
with
his
hands
on
his
knees
,
and
looking
between
*NL*
his
feet
.
Afterwards
he
followed
his
master
to
the
fort
,
where
all
the
*NL*
principal
Bugis
and
Patusan
inhabitants
had
been
summoned
for
a
talk
.
*NL*
Tamb
'
Itam
himself
hoped
there
would
be
some
fighting
.
``
What
was
it
but
*NL*
the
taking
of
another
hill
?
''
he
exclaimed
regretfully
.
However
,
in
the
*NL*
town
many
hoped
that
the
rapacious
strangers
would
be
induced
,
by
the
*NL*
sight
of
so
many
brave
men
making
ready
to
fight
,
to
go
away
.
It
would
*NL*
be
a
good
thing
if
they
went
away
.
Since
Jim
's
arrival
had
been
made
*NL*
known
before
daylight
by
the
gun
fired
from
the
fort
and
the
beating
of
*NL*
the
big
drum
there
,
the
fear
that
had
hung
over
Patusan
had
broken
and
*NL*
subsided
like
a
wave
on
a
rock
,
leaving
the
seething
foam
of
excitement
,
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
endless
speculation
.
Half
of
the
population
had
been
*NL*
ousted
out
of
their
homes
for
purposes
of
defence
,
and
were
living
in
*NL*
the
street
on
the
left
side
of
the
river
,
crowding
round
the
fort
,
and
*NL*
in
momentary
expectation
of
seeing
their
abandoned
dwellings
on
the
*NL*
threatened
bank
burst
into
flames
.
The
general
anxiety
was
to
see
the
*NL*
matter
settled
quickly
.
Food
,
through
Jewel
's
care
,
had
been
served
*NL*
out
to
the
refugees
.
Nobody
knew
what
their
white
man
would
do
.
Some
*NL*
remarked
that
it
was
worse
than
in
Sherif
Ali
's
war
.
Then
many
people
*NL*
did
not
care
;
now
everybody
had
something
to
lose
.
The
movements
of
*NL*
canoes
passing
to
and
fro
between
the
two
parts
of
the
town
were
watched
*NL*
with
interest
.
A
couple
of
Bugis
war-boats
lay
anchored
in
the
middle
of
*NL*
the
stream
to
protect
the
river
,
and
a
thread
of
smoke
stood
at
the
bow
*NL*
of
each
;
the
men
in
them
were
cooking
their
midday
rice
when
Jim
,
after
*NL*
his
interviews
with
Brown
and
Doramin
,
crossed
the
river
and
entered
by
*NL*
the
water-gate
of
his
fort
.
The
people
inside
crowded
round
him
,
so
that
*NL*
he
could
hardly
make
his
way
to
the
house
.
They
had
not
seen
him
before
,
*NL*
because
on
his
arrival
during
the
night
he
had
only
exchanged
a
few
*NL*
words
with
the
girl
,
who
had
come
down
to
the
landing-stage
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
and
had
then
gone
on
at
once
to
join
the
chiefs
and
the
*NL*
fighting
men
on
the
other
bank
.
People
shouted
greetings
after
him
.
*NL*
One
old
woman
raised
a
laugh
by
pushing
her
way
to
the
front
madly
and
*NL*
enjoining
him
in
a
scolding
voice
to
see
to
it
that
her
two
sons
,
who
*NL*
were
with
Doramin
,
did
not
come
to
harm
at
the
hands
of
the
robbers
.
*NL*
Several
of
the
bystanders
tried
to
pull
her
away
,
but
she
struggled
and
*NL*
cried
,
``
Let
me
go
.
What
is
this
,
O
Muslims
?
This
laughter
is
unseemly
.
*NL*
Are
they
not
cruel
,
bloodthirsty
robbers
bent
on
killing
?
''
``
Let
her
be
,
''
*NL*
said
Jim
,
and
as
a
silence
fell
suddenly
,
he
said
slowly
,
``
Everybody
*NL*
shall
be
safe
.
''
He
entered
the
house
before
the
great
sigh
,
and
the
loud
*NL*
murmurs
of
satisfaction
,
had
died
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
There
's
no
doubt
his
mind
was
made
up
that
Brown
should
have
his
way
*NL*
clear
back
to
the
sea
.
His
fate
,
revolted
,
was
forcing
his
hand
.
He
*NL*
had
for
the
first
time
to
affirm
his
will
in
the
face
of
outspoken
*NL*
opposition
.
``
There
was
much
talk
,
and
at
first
my
master
was
silent
,
''
*NL*
Tamb
'
Itam
said
.
``
Darkness
came
,
and
then
I
lit
the
candles
on
the
long
*NL*
table
.
The
chiefs
sat
on
each
side
,
and
the
lady
remained
by
my
master
's
*NL*
right
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
he
began
to
speak
,
the
unaccustomed
difficulty
seemed
only
to
*NL*
fix
his
resolve
more
immovably
.
The
white
men
were
now
waiting
for
his
*NL*
answer
on
the
hill
.
Their
chief
had
spoken
to
him
in
the
language
of
his
*NL*
own
people
,
making
clear
many
things
difficult
to
explain
in
any
other
*NL*
speech
.
They
were
erring
men
whom
suffering
had
made
blind
to
right
and
*NL*
wrong
.
It
is
true
that
lives
had
been
lost
already
,
but
why
lose
more
?
*NL*
He
declared
to
his
hearers
,
the
assembled
heads
of
the
people
,
that
*NL*
their
welfare
was
his
welfare
,
their
losses
his
losses
,
their
mourning
*NL*
his
mourning
.
He
looked
round
at
the
grave
listening
faces
and
told
them
*NL*
to
remember
that
they
had
fought
and
worked
side
by
side
.
They
knew
his
*NL*
courage
...
Here
a
murmur
interrupted
him
...
And
that
he
had
never
*NL*
deceived
them
.
For
many
years
they
had
dwelt
together
.
He
loved
the
*NL*
land
and
the
people
living
in
it
with
a
very
great
love
.
He
was
ready
to
*NL*
answer
with
his
life
for
any
harm
that
should
come
to
them
if
the
white
*NL*
men
with
beards
were
allowed
to
retire
.
They
were
evil-doers
,
but
their
*NL*
destiny
had
been
evil
,
too
.
Had
he
ever
advised
them
ill
?
Had
his
words
*NL*
ever
brought
suffering
to
the
people
?
he
asked
.
He
believed
that
it
*NL*
would
be
best
to
let
these
whites
and
their
followers
go
with
their
*NL*
lives
.
It
would
be
a
small
gift
.
``
I
whom
you
have
tried
and
found
always
*NL*
true
ask
you
to
let
them
go
.
''
He
turned
to
Doramin
.
The
old
nakhoda
made
*NL*
no
movement
.
``
Then
,
''
said
Jim
,
``
call
in
Dain
Waris
,
your
son
,
my
friend
,
*NL*
for
in
this
business
I
shall
not
lead
.

CHAPTER
43
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
behind
his
chair
was
thunderstruck
.
The
declaration
produced
*NL*
an
immense
sensation
.
``
Let
them
go
because
this
is
best
in
my
knowledge
*NL*
which
has
never
deceived
you
,
''
Jim
insisted
.
There
was
a
silence
.
In
*NL*
the
darkness
of
the
courtyard
could
be
heard
the
subdued
whispering
,
*NL*
shuffling
noise
of
many
people
.
Doramin
raised
his
heavy
head
and
said
*NL*
that
there
was
no
more
reading
of
hearts
than
touching
the
sky
with
the
*NL*
hand
,
but
--
he
consented
.
The
others
gave
their
opinion
in
turn
.
``
It
is
*NL*
best
,
''
``
Let
them
go
,
''
and
so
on
.
But
most
of
them
simply
said
that
they
*NL*
``
believed
Tuan
Jim
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
In
this
simple
form
of
assent
to
his
will
lies
the
whole
gist
of
*NL*
the
situation
;
their
creed
,
his
truth
;
and
the
testimony
to
that
*NL*
faithfulness
which
made
him
in
his
own
eyes
the
equal
of
the
*NL*
impeccable
men
who
never
fall
out
of
the
ranks
.
Stein
's
words
,
*NL*
``
Romantic
!
--
Romantic
!
''
seem
to
ring
over
those
distances
that
will
never
*NL*
give
him
up
now
to
a
world
indifferent
to
his
failings
and
his
virtues
,
*NL*
and
to
that
ardent
and
clinging
affection
that
refuses
him
the
dole
of
*NL*
tears
in
the
bewilderment
of
a
great
grief
and
of
eternal
separation
.
*NL*
From
the
moment
the
sheer
truthfulness
of
his
last
three
years
of
life
*NL*
carries
the
day
against
the
ignorance
,
the
fear
,
and
the
anger
of
men
,
*NL*
he
appears
no
longer
to
me
as
I
saw
him
last
--
a
white
speck
catching
all
*NL*
the
dim
light
left
upon
a
sombre
coast
and
the
darkened
sea
--
but
greater
*NL*
and
more
pitiful
in
the
loneliness
of
his
soul
,
that
remains
even
for
*NL*
her
who
loved
him
best
a
cruel
and
insoluble
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
is
evident
that
he
did
not
mistrust
Brown
;
there
was
no
reason
to
*NL*
doubt
the
story
,
whose
truth
seemed
warranted
by
the
rough
frankness
,
*NL*
by
a
sort
of
virile
sincerity
in
accepting
the
morality
and
the
*NL*
consequences
of
his
acts
.
But
Jim
did
not
know
the
almost
inconceivable
*NL*
egotism
of
the
man
which
made
him
,
when
resisted
and
foiled
in
his
will
,
*NL*
mad
with
the
indignant
and
revengeful
rage
of
a
thwarted
autocrat
.
*NL*
But
if
Jim
did
not
mistrust
Brown
,
he
was
evidently
anxious
that
some
*NL*
misunderstanding
should
not
occur
,
ending
perhaps
in
collision
and
*NL*
bloodshed
.
It
was
for
this
reason
that
directly
the
Malay
chiefs
had
*NL*
gone
he
asked
Jewel
to
get
him
something
to
eat
,
as
he
was
going
out
of
*NL*
the
fort
to
take
command
in
the
town
.
On
her
remonstrating
against
this
*NL*
on
the
score
of
his
fatigue
,
he
said
that
something
might
happen
for
*NL*
which
he
would
never
forgive
himself
.
``
I
am
responsible
for
every
life
*NL*
in
the
land
,
''
he
said
.
He
was
moody
at
first
;
she
served
him
with
her
*NL*
own
hands
,
taking
the
plates
and
dishes
-LRB-
of
the
dinner-service
presented
*NL*
him
by
Stein
-RRB-
from
Tamb
'
Itam
.
He
brightened
up
after
a
while
;
told
her
*NL*
she
would
be
again
in
command
of
the
fort
for
another
night
.
``
There
's
*NL*
no
sleep
for
us
,
old
girl
,
''
he
said
,
``
while
our
people
are
in
danger
.
''
*NL*
Later
on
he
said
jokingly
that
she
was
the
best
man
of
them
all
.
``
If
you
*NL*
and
Dain
Waris
had
done
what
you
wanted
,
not
one
of
these
poor
devils
*NL*
would
be
alive
to-day
.
''
``
Are
they
very
bad
?
''
she
asked
,
leaning
over
his
*NL*
chair
.
``
Men
act
badly
sometimes
without
being
much
worse
than
others
,
''
*NL*
he
said
after
some
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
followed
his
master
to
the
landing-stage
outside
the
fort
.
*NL*
The
night
was
clear
but
without
a
moon
,
and
the
middle
of
the
river
was
*NL*
dark
,
while
the
water
under
each
bank
reflected
the
light
of
many
fires
*NL*
``
as
on
a
night
of
Ramadan
,
''
Tamb
'
Itam
said
.
War-boats
drifted
silently
*NL*
in
the
dark
lane
or
,
anchored
,
floated
motionless
with
a
loud
ripple
.
*NL*
That
night
there
was
much
paddling
in
a
canoe
and
walking
at
his
*NL*
master
's
heels
for
Tamb
'
Itam
:
up
and
down
the
street
they
tramped
,
*NL*
where
the
fires
were
burning
,
inland
on
the
outskirts
of
the
town
where
*NL*
small
parties
of
men
kept
guard
in
the
fields
.
Tuan
Jim
gave
his
orders
*NL*
and
was
obeyed
.
Last
of
all
they
went
to
the
Rajah
's
stockade
,
which
a
*NL*
detachment
of
Jim
's
people
manned
on
that
night
.
The
old
Rajah
had
fled
*NL*
early
in
the
morning
with
most
of
his
women
to
a
small
house
he
had
*NL*
near
a
jungle
village
on
a
tributary
stream
.
Kassim
,
left
behind
,
had
*NL*
attended
the
council
with
his
air
of
diligent
activity
to
explain
away
*NL*
the
diplomacy
of
the
day
before
.
He
was
considerably
cold-shouldered
,
*NL*
but
managed
to
preserve
his
smiling
,
quiet
alertness
,
and
professed
*NL*
himself
highly
delighted
when
Jim
told
him
sternly
that
he
proposed
to
*NL*
occupy
the
stockade
on
that
night
with
his
own
men
.
After
the
council
*NL*
broke
up
he
was
heard
outside
accosting
this
and
that
deputing
chief
,
*NL*
and
speaking
in
a
loud
,
gratified
tone
of
the
Rajah
's
property
being
*NL*
protected
in
the
Rajah
's
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
ten
or
so
Jim
's
men
marched
in
.
The
stockade
commanded
the
mouth
*NL*
of
the
creek
,
and
Jim
meant
to
remain
there
till
Brown
had
passed
below
.
*NL*
A
small
fire
was
lit
on
the
flat
,
grassy
point
outside
the
wall
of
*NL*
stakes
,
and
Tamb
'
Itam
placed
a
little
folding-stool
for
his
master
.
Jim
*NL*
told
him
to
try
and
sleep
.
Tamb
'
Itam
got
a
mat
and
lay
down
a
little
*NL*
way
off
;
but
he
could
not
sleep
,
though
he
knew
he
had
to
go
on
an
*NL*
important
journey
before
the
night
was
out
.
His
master
walked
to
and
fro
*NL*
before
the
fire
with
bowed
head
and
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
.
His
*NL*
face
was
sad
.
Whenever
his
master
approached
him
Tamb
'
Itam
pretended
to
*NL*
sleep
,
not
wishing
his
master
to
know
he
had
been
watched
.
At
last
his
*NL*
master
stood
still
,
looking
down
on
him
as
he
lay
,
and
said
softly
,
``
It
*NL*
is
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
arose
directly
and
made
his
preparations
.
His
mission
was
*NL*
to
go
down
the
river
,
preceding
Brown
's
boat
by
an
hour
or
more
,
to
tell
*NL*
Dain
Waris
finally
and
formally
that
the
whites
were
to
be
allowed
to
*NL*
pass
out
unmolested
.
Jim
would
not
trust
anybody
else
with
that
service
.
*NL*
Before
starting
,
Tamb
'
Itam
,
more
as
a
matter
of
form
-LRB-
since
his
*NL*
position
about
Jim
made
him
perfectly
known
-RRB-
,
asked
for
a
token
.
*NL*
``
Because
,
Tuan
,
''
he
said
,
``
the
message
is
important
,
and
these
are
thy
*NL*
very
words
I
carry
.
''
His
master
first
put
his
hand
into
one
pocket
,
then
*NL*
into
another
,
and
finally
took
off
his
forefinger
Stein
's
silver
ring
,
*NL*
which
he
habitually
wore
,
and
gave
it
to
Tamb
'
Itam
.
When
Tamb
'
Itam
*NL*
left
on
his
mission
,
Brown
's
camp
on
the
knoll
was
dark
but
for
a
single
*NL*
small
glow
shining
through
the
branches
of
one
of
the
trees
the
white
*NL*
men
had
cut
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Early
in
the
evening
Brown
had
received
from
Jim
a
folded
piece
of
*NL*
paper
on
which
was
written
,
``
You
get
the
clear
road
.
Start
as
soon
*NL*
as
your
boat
floats
on
the
morning
tide
.
Let
your
men
be
careful
.
The
*NL*
bushes
on
both
sides
of
the
creek
and
the
stockade
at
the
mouth
are
full
*NL*
of
well-armed
men
.
You
would
have
no
chance
,
but
I
do
n't
believe
you
*NL*
want
bloodshed
.
''
Brown
read
it
,
tore
the
paper
into
small
pieces
,
and
,
*NL*
turning
to
Cornelius
,
who
had
brought
it
,
said
jeeringly
,
``
Good-bye
,
my
*NL*
excellent
friend
.
''
Cornelius
had
been
in
the
fort
,
and
had
been
sneaking
*NL*
around
Jim
's
house
during
the
afternoon
.
Jim
chose
him
to
carry
the
note
*NL*
because
he
could
speak
English
,
was
known
to
Brown
,
and
was
not
likely
*NL*
to
be
shot
by
some
nervous
mistake
of
one
of
the
men
as
a
Malay
,
*NL*
approaching
in
the
dusk
,
perhaps
might
have
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Cornelius
did
n't
go
away
after
delivering
the
paper
.
Brown
was
sitting
*NL*
up
over
a
tiny
fire
;
all
the
others
were
lying
down
.
``
I
could
tell
you
*NL*
something
you
would
like
to
know
,
''
Cornelius
mumbled
crossly
.
Brown
paid
*NL*
no
attention
.
``
You
did
not
kill
him
,
''
went
on
the
other
,
``
and
what
do
*NL*
you
get
for
it
?
You
might
have
had
money
from
the
Rajah
,
besides
the
*NL*
loot
of
all
the
Bugis
houses
,
and
now
you
get
nothing
.
''
``
You
had
better
*NL*
clear
out
from
here
,
''
growled
Brown
,
without
even
looking
at
him
.
But
*NL*
Cornelius
let
himself
drop
by
his
side
and
began
to
whisper
very
fast
,
*NL*
touching
his
elbow
from
time
to
time
.
What
he
had
to
say
made
Brown
sit
*NL*
up
at
first
,
with
a
curse
.
He
had
simply
informed
him
of
Dain
Waris
's
*NL*
armed
party
down
the
river
.
At
first
Brown
saw
himself
completely
sold
*NL*
and
betrayed
,
but
a
moment
's
reflection
convinced
him
that
there
could
*NL*
be
no
treachery
intended
.
He
said
nothing
,
and
after
a
while
Cornelius
*NL*
remarked
,
in
a
tone
of
complete
indifference
,
that
there
was
another
way
*NL*
out
of
the
river
which
he
knew
very
well
.
``
A
good
thing
to
know
,
too
,
''
*NL*
said
Brown
,
pricking
up
his
ears
;
and
Cornelius
began
to
talk
of
*NL*
what
went
on
in
town
and
repeated
all
that
had
been
said
in
council
,
*NL*
gossiping
in
an
even
undertone
at
Brown
's
ear
as
you
talk
amongst
*NL*
sleeping
men
you
do
not
wish
to
wake
.
``
He
thinks
he
has
made
me
*NL*
harmless
,
does
he
?
''
mumbled
Brown
very
low
...
``
Yes
.
He
is
a
fool
.
A
*NL*
little
child
.
He
came
here
and
robbed
me
,
''
droned
on
Cornelius
,
``
and
he
*NL*
made
all
the
people
believe
him
.
But
if
something
happened
that
they
did
*NL*
not
believe
him
any
more
,
where
would
he
be
?
And
the
Bugis
Dain
who
*NL*
is
waiting
for
you
down
the
river
there
,
captain
,
is
the
very
man
who
*NL*
chased
you
up
here
when
you
first
came
.
''
Brown
observed
nonchalantly
*NL*
that
it
would
be
just
as
well
to
avoid
him
,
and
with
the
same
detached
,
*NL*
musing
air
Cornelius
declared
himself
acquainted
with
a
backwater
broad
*NL*
enough
to
take
Brown
's
boat
past
Waris
's
camp
.
``
You
will
have
to
be
*NL*
quiet
,
''
he
said
as
an
afterthought
,
``
for
in
one
place
we
pass
close
*NL*
behind
his
camp
.
Very
close
.
They
are
camped
ashore
with
their
boats
*NL*
hauled
up
.
''
``
Oh
,
we
know
how
to
be
as
quiet
as
mice
;
never
fear
,
''
said
*NL*
Brown
.
Cornelius
stipulated
that
in
case
he
were
to
pilot
Brown
out
,
his
*NL*
canoe
should
be
towed
.
``
I
'll
have
to
get
back
quick
,
''
he
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
two
hours
before
the
dawn
when
word
was
passed
to
the
stockade
*NL*
from
outlying
watchers
that
the
white
robbers
were
coming
down
to
their
*NL*
boat
.
In
a
very
short
time
every
armed
man
from
one
end
of
Patusan
*NL*
to
the
other
was
on
the
alert
,
yet
the
banks
of
the
river
remained
so
*NL*
silent
that
but
for
the
fires
burning
with
sudden
blurred
flares
the
*NL*
town
might
have
been
asleep
as
if
in
peace-time
.
A
heavy
mist
lay
very
*NL*
low
on
the
water
,
making
a
sort
of
illusive
grey
light
that
showed
*NL*
nothing
.
When
Brown
's
long-boat
glided
out
of
the
creek
into
the
*NL*
river
,
Jim
was
standing
on
the
low
point
of
land
before
the
Rajah
's
*NL*
stockade
--
on
the
very
spot
where
for
the
first
time
he
put
his
foot
on
*NL*
Patusan
shore
.
A
shadow
loomed
up
,
moving
in
the
greyness
,
solitary
,
*NL*
very
bulky
,
and
yet
constantly
eluding
the
eye
.
A
murmur
of
low
talking
*NL*
came
out
of
it
.
Brown
at
the
tiller
heard
Jim
speak
calmly
:
``
A
clear
*NL*
road
.
You
had
better
trust
to
the
current
while
the
fog
lasts
;
but
*NL*
this
will
lift
presently
.
''
``
Yes
,
presently
we
shall
see
clear
,
''
replied
*NL*
Brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
thirty
or
forty
men
standing
with
muskets
at
ready
outside
the
*NL*
stockade
held
their
breath
.
The
Bugis
owner
of
the
prau
,
whom
I
saw
*NL*
on
Stein
's
verandah
,
and
who
was
amongst
them
,
told
me
that
the
boat
,
*NL*
shaving
the
low
point
close
,
seemed
for
a
moment
to
grow
big
and
hang
*NL*
over
it
like
a
mountain
.
``
If
you
think
it
worth
your
while
to
wait
a
*NL*
day
outside
,
''
called
out
Jim
,
``
I
'll
try
to
send
you
down
something
--
a
*NL*
bullock
,
some
yams
--
what
I
can
.
''
The
shadow
went
on
moving
.
``
Yes
.
Do
,
''
*NL*
said
a
voice
,
blank
and
muffled
out
of
the
fog
.
Not
one
of
the
many
*NL*
attentive
listeners
understood
what
the
words
meant
;
and
then
Brown
*NL*
and
his
men
in
their
boat
floated
away
,
fading
spectrally
without
the
*NL*
slightest
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
Brown
,
invisible
in
the
mist
,
goes
out
of
Patusan
elbow
to
elbow
*NL*
with
Cornelius
in
the
stern-sheets
of
the
long-boat
.
``
Perhaps
you
shall
*NL*
get
a
small
bullock
,
''
said
Cornelius
.
``
Oh
yes
.
Bullock
.
Yam
.
You
'll
get
*NL*
it
if
he
said
so
.
He
always
speaks
the
truth
.
He
stole
everything
I
had
.
*NL*
I
suppose
you
like
a
small
bullock
better
than
the
loot
of
many
houses
.
''
*NL*
``
I
would
advise
you
to
hold
your
tongue
,
or
somebody
here
may
fling
*NL*
you
overboard
into
this
damned
fog
,
''
said
Brown
.
The
boat
seemed
to
be
*NL*
standing
still
;
nothing
could
be
seen
,
not
even
the
river
alongside
,
*NL*
only
the
water-dust
flew
and
trickled
,
condensed
,
down
their
beards
and
*NL*
faces
.
It
was
weird
,
Brown
told
me
.
Every
individual
man
of
them
felt
*NL*
as
though
he
were
adrift
alone
in
a
boat
,
haunted
by
an
almost
*NL*
imperceptible
suspicion
of
sighing
,
muttering
ghosts
.
``
Throw
me
out
,
*NL*
would
you
?
But
I
would
know
where
I
was
,
''
mumbled
Cornelius
surlily
.
*NL*
``
I
've
lived
many
years
here
.
''
``
Not
long
enough
to
see
through
a
fog
like
*NL*
this
,
''
Brown
said
,
lolling
back
with
his
arm
swinging
to
and
fro
on
the
*NL*
useless
tiller
.
``
Yes
.
Long
enough
for
that
,
''
snarled
Cornelius
.
``
That
's
*NL*
very
useful
,
''
commented
Brown
.
``
Am
I
to
believe
you
could
find
that
*NL*
backway
you
spoke
of
blindfold
,
like
this
?
''
Cornelius
grunted
.
``
Are
you
*NL*
too
tired
to
row
?
''
he
asked
after
a
silence
.
``
No
,
by
God
!
''
shouted
Brown
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
Out
with
your
oars
there
.
''
There
was
a
great
knocking
in
*NL*
the
fog
,
which
after
a
while
settled
into
a
regular
grind
of
invisible
*NL*
sweeps
against
invisible
thole-pins
.
Otherwise
nothing
was
changed
,
and
*NL*
but
for
the
slight
splash
of
a
dipped
blade
it
was
like
rowing
a
balloon
*NL*
car
in
a
cloud
,
said
Brown
.
Thereafter
Cornelius
did
not
open
his
lips
*NL*
except
to
ask
querulously
for
somebody
to
bale
out
his
canoe
,
which
*NL*
was
towing
behind
the
long-boat
.
Gradually
the
fog
whitened
and
became
*NL*
luminous
ahead
.
To
the
left
Brown
saw
a
darkness
as
though
he
had
been
*NL*
looking
at
the
back
of
the
departing
night
.
All
at
once
a
big
bough
*NL*
covered
with
leaves
appeared
above
his
head
,
and
ends
of
twigs
,
dripping
*NL*
and
still
,
curved
slenderly
close
alongside
.
Cornelius
,
without
a
word
,
*NL*
took
the
tiller
from
his
hand
.

CHAPTER
44
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
n't
think
they
spoke
together
again
.
The
boat
entered
a
narrow
*NL*
by-channel
,
where
it
was
pushed
by
the
oar-blades
set
into
crumbling
*NL*
banks
,
and
there
was
a
gloom
as
if
enormous
black
wings
had
been
*NL*
outspread
above
the
mist
that
filled
its
depth
to
the
summits
of
the
*NL*
trees
.
The
branches
overhead
showered
big
drops
through
the
gloomy
fog
.
*NL*
At
a
mutter
from
Cornelius
,
Brown
ordered
his
men
to
load
.
``
I
'll
*NL*
give
you
a
chance
to
get
even
with
them
before
we
're
done
,
you
dismal
*NL*
cripples
,
you
,
''
he
said
to
his
gang
.
``
Mind
you
do
n't
throw
it
away
--
you
*NL*
hounds
.
''
Low
growls
answered
that
speech
.
Cornelius
showed
much
fussy
*NL*
concern
for
the
safety
of
his
canoe
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Meantime
Tamb
'
Itam
had
reached
the
end
of
his
journey
.
The
fog
had
*NL*
delayed
him
a
little
,
but
he
had
paddled
steadily
,
keeping
in
touch
with
*NL*
the
south
bank
.
By-and-by
daylight
came
like
a
glow
in
a
ground
glass
*NL*
globe
.
The
shores
made
on
each
side
of
the
river
a
dark
smudge
,
in
which
*NL*
one
could
detect
hints
of
columnar
forms
and
shadows
of
twisted
branches
*NL*
high
up
.
The
mist
was
still
thick
on
the
water
,
but
a
good
watch
was
*NL*
being
kept
,
for
as
Iamb
'
Itam
approached
the
camp
the
figures
of
two
men
*NL*
emerged
out
of
the
white
vapour
,
and
voices
spoke
to
him
boisterously
.
*NL*
He
answered
,
and
presently
a
canoe
lay
alongside
,
and
he
exchanged
news
*NL*
with
the
paddlers
.
All
was
well
.
The
trouble
was
over
.
Then
the
men
in
*NL*
the
canoe
let
go
their
grip
on
the
side
of
his
dug-out
and
incontinently
*NL*
fell
out
of
sight
.
He
pursued
his
way
till
he
heard
voices
coming
to
him
*NL*
quietly
over
the
water
,
and
saw
,
under
the
now
lifting
,
swirling
mist
,
*NL*
the
glow
of
many
little
fires
burning
on
a
sandy
stretch
,
backed
by
*NL*
lofty
thin
timber
and
bushes
.
There
again
a
look-out
was
kept
,
for
he
*NL*
was
challenged
.
He
shouted
his
name
as
the
two
last
sweeps
of
his
paddle
*NL*
ran
his
canoe
up
on
the
strand
.
It
was
a
big
camp
.
Men
crouched
in
many
*NL*
little
knots
under
a
subdued
murmur
of
early
morning
talk
.
Many
thin
*NL*
threads
of
smoke
curled
slowly
on
the
white
mist
.
Little
shelters
,
*NL*
elevated
above
the
ground
,
had
been
built
for
the
chiefs
.
Muskets
were
*NL*
stacked
in
small
pyramids
,
and
long
spears
were
stuck
singly
into
the
*NL*
sand
near
the
fires
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
,
assuming
an
air
of
importance
,
demanded
to
be
led
to
Dain
*NL*
Waris
.
He
found
the
friend
of
his
white
lord
lying
on
a
raised
couch
*NL*
made
of
bamboo
,
and
sheltered
by
a
sort
of
shed
of
sticks
covered
with
*NL*
mats
.
Dain
Waris
was
awake
,
and
a
bright
fire
was
burning
before
his
*NL*
sleeping-place
,
which
resembled
a
rude
shrine
.
The
only
son
of
nakhoda
*NL*
Doramin
answered
his
greeting
kindly
.
Tamb
'
Itam
began
by
handing
him
*NL*
the
ring
which
vouched
for
the
truth
of
the
messenger
's
words
.
Dain
*NL*
Waris
,
reclining
on
his
elbow
,
bade
him
speak
and
tell
all
the
news
.
*NL*
Beginning
with
the
consecrated
formula
,
``
The
news
is
good
,
''
Tamb
'
Itam
*NL*
delivered
Jim
's
own
words
.
The
white
men
,
deputing
with
the
consent
of
*NL*
all
the
chiefs
,
were
to
be
allowed
to
pass
down
the
river
.
In
answer
to
*NL*
a
question
or
two
Tamb
'
Itam
then
reported
the
proceedings
of
the
last
*NL*
council
.
Dain
Waris
listened
attentively
to
the
end
,
toying
with
the
*NL*
ring
which
ultimately
he
slipped
on
the
forefinger
of
his
right
hand
.
*NL*
After
hearing
all
he
had
to
say
he
dismissed
Tamb
'
Itam
to
have
food
*NL*
and
rest
.
Orders
for
the
return
in
the
afternoon
were
given
immediately
.
*NL*
Afterwards
Dain
Waris
lay
down
again
,
open-eyed
,
while
his
personal
*NL*
attendants
were
preparing
his
food
at
the
fire
,
by
which
Tamb
'
Itam
also
*NL*
sat
talking
to
the
men
who
lounged
up
to
hear
the
latest
intelligence
*NL*
from
the
town
.
The
sun
was
eating
up
the
mist
.
A
good
watch
was
kept
*NL*
upon
the
reach
of
the
main
stream
where
the
boat
of
the
whites
was
*NL*
expected
to
appear
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
then
that
Brown
took
his
revenge
upon
the
world
which
,
after
*NL*
twenty
years
of
contemptuous
and
reckless
bullying
,
refused
him
the
*NL*
tribute
of
a
common
robber
's
success
.
It
was
an
act
of
cold-blooded
*NL*
ferocity
,
and
it
consoled
him
on
his
deathbed
like
a
memory
of
an
*NL*
indomitable
defiance
.
Stealthily
he
landed
his
men
on
the
other
side
*NL*
of
the
island
opposite
to
the
Bugis
camp
,
and
led
them
across
.
After
a
*NL*
short
but
quite
silent
scuffle
,
Cornelius
,
who
had
tried
to
slink
away
*NL*
at
the
moment
of
landing
,
resigned
himself
to
show
the
way
where
the
*NL*
undergrowth
was
most
sparse
.
Brown
held
both
his
skinny
hands
together
*NL*
behind
his
back
in
the
grip
of
one
vast
fist
,
and
now
and
then
impelled
*NL*
him
forward
with
a
fierce
push
.
Cornelius
remained
as
mute
as
a
fish
,
*NL*
abject
but
faithful
to
his
purpose
,
whose
accomplishment
loomed
before
*NL*
him
dimly
.
At
the
edge
of
the
patch
of
forest
Brown
's
men
spread
*NL*
themselves
out
in
cover
and
waited
.
The
camp
was
plain
from
end
to
end
*NL*
before
their
eyes
,
and
no
one
looked
their
way
.
Nobody
even
dreamed
that
*NL*
the
white
men
could
have
any
knowledge
of
the
narrow
channel
at
the
back
*NL*
of
the
island
.
When
he
judged
the
moment
come
,
Brown
yelled
,
``
Let
them
*NL*
have
it
,
''
and
fourteen
shots
rang
out
like
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
told
me
the
surprise
was
so
great
that
,
except
for
those
who
*NL*
fell
dead
or
wounded
,
not
a
soul
of
them
moved
for
quite
an
appreciable
*NL*
time
after
the
first
discharge
.
Then
a
man
screamed
,
and
after
that
*NL*
scream
a
great
yell
of
amazement
and
fear
went
up
from
all
the
throats
.
*NL*
A
blind
panic
drove
these
men
in
a
surging
swaying
mob
to
and
fro
along
*NL*
the
shore
like
a
herd
of
cattle
afraid
of
the
water
.
Some
few
jumped
*NL*
into
the
river
then
,
but
most
of
them
did
so
only
after
the
last
*NL*
discharge
.
Three
times
Brown
's
men
fired
into
the
ruck
,
Brown
,
the
only
*NL*
one
in
view
,
cursing
and
yelling
,
``
Aim
low
!
aim
low
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
says
that
,
as
for
him
,
he
understood
at
the
first
volley
*NL*
what
had
happened
.
Though
untouched
he
fell
down
and
lay
as
if
dead
,
*NL*
but
with
his
eyes
open
.
At
the
sound
of
the
first
shots
Dain
Waris
,
*NL*
reclining
on
the
couch
,
jumped
up
and
ran
out
upon
the
open
shore
,
just
*NL*
in
time
to
receive
a
bullet
in
his
forehead
at
the
second
discharge
.
*NL*
Tamb
'
Itam
saw
him
fling
his
arms
wide
open
before
he
fell
.
Then
,
he
*NL*
says
,
a
great
fear
came
upon
him
--
not
before
.
The
white
men
retired
as
*NL*
they
had
come
--
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Thus
Brown
balanced
his
account
with
the
evil
fortune
.
Notice
that
even
*NL*
in
this
awful
outbreak
there
is
a
superiority
as
of
a
man
who
carries
*NL*
right
--
the
abstract
thing
--
within
the
envelope
of
his
common
desires
.
*NL*
It
was
not
a
vulgar
and
treacherous
massacre
;
it
was
a
lesson
,
a
*NL*
retribution
--
a
demonstration
of
some
obscure
and
awful
attribute
of
our
*NL*
nature
which
,
I
am
afraid
,
is
not
so
very
far
under
the
surface
as
we
*NL*
like
to
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Afterwards
the
whites
depart
unseen
by
Tamb
'
Itam
,
and
seem
to
vanish
*NL*
from
before
men
's
eyes
altogether
;
and
the
schooner
,
too
,
vanishes
after
*NL*
the
manner
of
stolen
goods
.
But
a
story
is
told
of
a
white
long-boat
*NL*
picked
up
a
month
later
in
the
Indian
Ocean
by
a
cargo
steamer
.
Two
*NL*
parched
,
yellow
,
glassy-eyed
,
whispering
skeletons
in
her
recognised
*NL*
the
authority
of
a
third
,
who
declared
that
his
name
was
Brown
.
His
*NL*
schooner
,
he
reported
,
bound
south
with
a
cargo
of
Java
sugar
,
had
*NL*
sprung
a
bad
leak
and
sank
under
his
feet
.
He
and
his
companions
were
*NL*
the
survivors
of
a
crew
of
six
.
The
two
died
on
board
the
steamer
which
*NL*
rescued
them
.
Brown
lived
to
be
seen
by
me
,
and
I
can
testify
that
he
*NL*
had
played
his
part
to
the
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
seems
,
however
,
that
in
going
away
they
had
neglected
to
cast
off
*NL*
Cornelius
's
canoe
.
Cornelius
himself
Brown
had
let
go
at
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
shooting
,
with
a
kick
for
a
parting
benediction
.
Tamb
'
Itam
,
*NL*
after
arising
from
amongst
the
dead
,
saw
the
Nazarene
running
up
and
*NL*
down
the
shore
amongst
the
corpses
and
the
expiring
fires
.
He
uttered
*NL*
little
cries
.
Suddenly
he
rushed
to
the
water
,
and
made
frantic
efforts
*NL*
to
get
one
of
the
Bugis
boats
into
the
water
.
``
Afterwards
,
till
he
had
*NL*
seen
me
,
''
related
Tamb
'
Itam
,
``
he
stood
looking
at
the
heavy
canoe
and
*NL*
scratching
his
head
.
''
``
What
became
of
him
?
''
I
asked
.
Tamb
'
Itam
,
staring
*NL*
hard
at
me
,
made
an
expressive
gesture
with
his
right
arm
.
``
Twice
I
*NL*
struck
,
Tuan
,
''
he
said
.
``
When
he
beheld
me
approaching
he
cast
himself
*NL*
violently
on
the
ground
and
made
a
great
outcry
,
kicking
.
He
screeched
*NL*
like
a
frightened
hen
till
he
felt
the
point
;
then
he
was
still
,
and
lay
*NL*
staring
at
me
while
his
life
went
out
of
his
eyes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
This
done
,
Tamb
'
Itam
did
not
tarry
.
He
understood
the
importance
of
*NL*
being
the
first
with
the
awful
news
at
the
fort
.
There
were
,
of
course
,
*NL*
many
survivors
of
Dain
Waris
's
party
;
but
in
the
extremity
of
panic
some
*NL*
had
swum
across
the
river
,
others
had
bolted
into
the
bush
.
The
fact
is
*NL*
that
they
did
not
know
really
who
struck
that
blow
--
whether
more
white
*NL*
robbers
were
not
coming
,
whether
they
had
not
already
got
hold
of
*NL*
the
whole
land
.
They
imagined
themselves
to
be
the
victims
of
a
vast
*NL*
treachery
,
and
utterly
doomed
to
destruction
.
It
is
said
that
some
small
*NL*
parties
did
not
come
in
till
three
days
afterwards
.
However
,
a
few
tried
*NL*
to
make
their
way
back
to
Patusan
at
once
,
and
one
of
the
canoes
that
*NL*
were
patrolling
the
river
that
morning
was
in
sight
of
the
camp
at
*NL*
the
very
moment
of
the
attack
.
It
is
true
that
at
first
the
men
in
her
*NL*
leaped
overboard
and
swam
to
the
opposite
bank
,
but
afterwards
they
*NL*
returned
to
their
boat
and
started
fearfully
up-stream
.
Of
these
Tamb
'
*NL*
Itam
had
an
hour
's
advance
.

CHAPTER
45
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
Tamb
'
Itam
,
paddling
madly
,
came
into
the
town-reach
,
the
women
,
*NL*
thronging
the
platforms
before
the
houses
,
were
looking
out
for
the
*NL*
return
of
Dain
Waris
's
little
fleet
of
boats
.
The
town
had
a
festive
*NL*
air
;
here
and
there
men
,
still
with
spears
or
guns
in
their
hands
,
could
*NL*
be
seen
moving
or
standing
on
the
shore
in
groups
.
Chinamen
's
shops
had
*NL*
been
opened
early
;
but
the
market-place
was
empty
,
and
a
sentry
,
still
*NL*
posted
at
the
corner
of
the
fort
,
made
out
Tamb
'
Itam
,
and
shouted
to
*NL*
those
within
.
The
gate
was
wide
open
.
Tamb
'
Itam
jumped
ashore
and
ran
*NL*
in
headlong
.
The
first
person
he
met
was
the
girl
coming
down
from
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
,
disordered
,
panting
,
with
trembling
lips
and
wild
eyes
,
*NL*
stood
for
a
time
before
her
as
if
a
sudden
spell
had
been
laid
on
him
.
*NL*
Then
he
broke
out
very
quickly
:
``
They
have
killed
Dain
Waris
and
many
*NL*
more
.
''
She
clapped
her
hands
,
and
her
first
words
were
,
``
Shut
the
*NL*
gates
.
''
Most
of
the
fortmen
had
gone
back
to
their
houses
,
but
Tamb
'
*NL*
Itam
hurried
on
the
few
who
remained
for
their
turn
of
duty
within
.
The
*NL*
girl
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
courtyard
while
the
others
ran
about
.
*NL*
``
Doramin
,
''
she
cried
despairingly
,
as
Tamb
'
Itam
passed
her
.
Next
time
*NL*
he
went
by
he
answered
her
thought
rapidly
,
``
Yes
.
But
we
have
all
the
*NL*
powder
in
Patusan
.
''
She
caught
him
by
the
arm
,
and
,
pointing
at
the
*NL*
house
,
``
Call
him
out
,
''
she
whispered
,
trembling
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
ran
up
the
steps
.
His
master
was
sleeping
.
``
It
is
I
,
Tamb
'
*NL*
Itam
,
''
he
cried
at
the
door
,
``
with
tidings
that
can
not
wait
.
''
He
saw
*NL*
Jim
turn
over
on
the
pillow
and
open
his
eyes
,
and
he
burst
out
at
*NL*
once
.
``
This
,
Tuan
,
is
a
day
of
evil
,
an
accursed
day
.
''
His
master
raised
*NL*
himself
on
his
elbow
to
listen
--
just
as
Dain
Waris
had
done
.
And
then
*NL*
Tamb
'
Itam
began
his
tale
,
trying
to
relate
the
story
in
order
,
calling
*NL*
Dain
Waris
Panglima
,
and
saying
:
``
The
Panglima
then
called
out
to
the
*NL*
chief
of
his
own
boatmen
,
`
Give
Tamb
'
Itam
something
to
eat
'
''
--
when
*NL*
his
master
put
his
feet
to
the
ground
and
looked
at
him
with
such
a
*NL*
discomposed
face
that
the
words
remained
in
his
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Speak
out
,
''
said
Jim
.
``
Is
he
dead
?
''
``
May
you
live
long
,
''
cried
Tamb
'
*NL*
Itam
.
``
It
was
a
most
cruel
treachery
.
He
ran
out
at
the
first
shots
and
*NL*
fell
.
''
...
His
master
walked
to
the
window
and
with
his
fist
struck
*NL*
at
the
shutter
.
The
room
was
made
light
;
and
then
in
a
steady
voice
,
but
*NL*
speaking
fast
,
he
began
to
give
him
orders
to
assemble
a
fleet
of
boats
*NL*
for
immediate
pursuit
,
go
to
this
man
,
to
the
other
--
send
messengers
;
*NL*
and
as
he
talked
he
sat
down
on
the
bed
,
stooping
to
lace
his
boots
*NL*
hurriedly
,
and
suddenly
looked
up
.
``
Why
do
you
stand
here
?
''
he
asked
*NL*
very
red-faced
.
``
Waste
no
time
.
''
Tamb
'
Itam
did
not
move
.
``
Forgive
me
,
*NL*
Tuan
,
but
...
but
,
''
he
began
to
stammer
.
``
What
?
''
cried
his
master
*NL*
aloud
,
looking
terrible
,
leaning
forward
with
his
hands
gripping
the
*NL*
edge
of
the
bed
.
``
It
is
not
safe
for
thy
servant
to
go
out
amongst
the
*NL*
people
,
''
said
Tamb
'
Itam
,
after
hesitating
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Then
Jim
understood
.
He
had
retreated
from
one
world
,
for
a
small
*NL*
matter
of
an
impulsive
jump
,
and
now
the
other
,
the
work
of
his
own
*NL*
hands
,
had
fallen
in
ruins
upon
his
head
.
It
was
not
safe
for
his
*NL*
servant
to
go
out
amongst
his
own
people
!
I
believe
that
in
that
very
*NL*
moment
he
had
decided
to
defy
the
disaster
in
the
only
way
it
occurred
*NL*
to
him
such
a
disaster
could
be
defied
;
but
all
I
know
is
that
,
without
*NL*
a
word
,
he
came
out
of
his
room
and
sat
before
the
long
table
,
at
the
*NL*
head
of
which
he
was
accustomed
to
regulate
the
affairs
of
his
world
,
*NL*
proclaiming
daily
the
truth
that
surely
lived
in
his
heart
.
The
dark
*NL*
powers
should
not
rob
him
twice
of
his
peace
.
He
sat
like
a
stone
*NL*
figure
.
Tamb
'
Itam
,
deferential
,
hinted
at
preparations
for
defence
.
*NL*
The
girl
he
loved
came
in
and
spoke
to
him
,
but
he
made
a
sign
with
his
*NL*
hand
,
and
she
was
awed
by
the
dumb
appeal
for
silence
in
it
.
She
went
*NL*
out
on
the
verandah
and
sat
on
the
threshold
,
as
if
to
guard
him
with
*NL*
her
body
from
dangers
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
What
thoughts
passed
through
his
head
--
what
memories
?
Who
can
tell
?
*NL*
Everything
was
gone
,
and
he
who
had
been
once
unfaithful
to
his
trust
*NL*
had
lost
again
all
men
's
confidence
.
It
was
then
,
I
believe
,
he
tried
*NL*
to
write
--
to
somebody
--
and
gave
it
up
.
Loneliness
was
closing
on
him
.
*NL*
People
had
trusted
him
with
their
lives
--
only
for
that
;
and
yet
they
*NL*
could
never
,
as
he
had
said
,
never
be
made
to
understand
him
.
Those
*NL*
without
did
not
hear
him
make
a
sound
.
Later
,
towards
the
evening
,
he
*NL*
came
to
the
door
and
called
for
Tamb
'
Itam
.
``
Well
?
''
he
asked
.
``
There
is
*NL*
much
weeping
.
Much
anger
too
,
''
said
Tamb
'
Itam
.
Jim
looked
up
at
him
.
*NL*
``
You
know
,
''
he
murmured
.
``
Yes
,
Tuan
,
''
said
Tamb
'
Itam
.
``
Thy
servant
does
*NL*
know
,
and
the
gates
are
closed
.
We
shall
have
to
fight
.
''
``
Fight
!
What
*NL*
for
?
''
he
asked
.
``
For
our
lives
.
''
``
I
have
no
life
,
''
he
said
.
Tamb
'
Itam
*NL*
heard
a
cry
from
the
girl
at
the
door
.
``
Who
knows
?
''
said
Tamb
'
Itam
.
*NL*
``
By
audacity
and
cunning
we
may
even
escape
.
There
is
much
fear
in
men
's
*NL*
hearts
too
.
''
He
went
out
,
thinking
vaguely
of
boats
and
of
open
sea
,
*NL*
leaving
Jim
and
the
girl
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
have
n't
the
heart
to
set
down
here
such
glimpses
as
she
had
given
*NL*
me
of
the
hour
or
more
she
passed
in
there
wrestling
with
him
for
the
*NL*
possession
of
her
happiness
.
Whether
he
had
any
hope
--
what
he
expected
,
*NL*
what
he
imagined
--
it
is
impossible
to
say
.
He
was
inflexible
,
and
with
*NL*
the
growing
loneliness
of
his
obstinacy
his
spirit
seemed
to
rise
above
*NL*
the
ruins
of
his
existence
.
She
cried
``
Fight
!
''
into
his
ear
.
She
could
*NL*
not
understand
.
There
was
nothing
to
fight
for
.
He
was
going
to
prove
*NL*
his
power
in
another
way
and
conquer
the
fatal
destiny
itself
.
He
came
*NL*
out
into
the
courtyard
,
and
behind
him
,
with
streaming
hair
,
wild
*NL*
of
face
,
breathless
,
she
staggered
out
and
leaned
on
the
side
of
the
*NL*
doorway
.
``
Open
the
gates
,
''
he
ordered
.
Afterwards
,
turning
to
those
of
*NL*
his
men
who
were
inside
,
he
gave
them
leave
to
depart
to
their
homes
.
*NL*
``
For
how
long
,
Tuan
?
''
asked
one
of
them
timidly
.
``
For
all
life
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
in
a
sombre
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
A
hush
had
fallen
upon
the
town
after
the
outburst
of
wailing
and
*NL*
lamentation
that
had
swept
over
the
river
,
like
a
gust
of
wind
from
the
*NL*
opened
abode
of
sorrow
.
But
rumours
flew
in
whispers
,
filling
the
hearts
*NL*
with
consternation
and
horrible
doubts
.
The
robbers
were
coming
back
,
*NL*
bringing
many
others
with
them
,
in
a
great
ship
,
and
there
would
be
no
*NL*
refuge
in
the
land
for
any
one
.
A
sense
of
utter
insecurity
as
during
*NL*
an
earthquake
pervaded
the
minds
of
men
,
who
whispered
their
suspicions
,
*NL*
looking
at
each
other
as
if
in
the
presence
of
some
awful
portent
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
sun
was
sinking
towards
the
forests
when
Dain
Waris
's
body
was
*NL*
brought
into
Doramin
's
campong
.
Four
men
carried
it
in
,
covered
decently
*NL*
with
a
white
sheet
which
the
old
mother
had
sent
out
down
to
the
gate
to
*NL*
meet
her
son
on
his
return
.
They
laid
him
at
Doramin
's
feet
,
and
the
old
*NL*
man
sat
still
for
a
long
time
,
one
hand
on
each
knee
,
looking
down
.
The
*NL*
fronds
of
palms
swayed
gently
,
and
the
foliage
of
fruit
trees
stirred
*NL*
above
his
head
.
Every
single
man
of
his
people
was
there
,
fully
armed
,
*NL*
when
the
old
nakhoda
at
last
raised
his
eyes
.
He
moved
them
slowly
over
*NL*
the
crowd
,
as
if
seeking
for
a
missing
face
.
Again
his
chin
sank
on
his
*NL*
breast
.
The
whispers
of
many
men
mingled
with
the
slight
rustling
of
the
*NL*
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
Malay
who
had
brought
Tamb
'
Itam
and
the
girl
to
Samarang
was
there
*NL*
too
.
``
Not
so
angry
as
many
,
''
he
said
to
me
,
but
struck
with
a
great
*NL*
awe
and
wonder
at
the
``
suddenness
of
men
's
fate
,
which
hangs
over
their
*NL*
heads
like
a
cloud
charged
with
thunder
.
''
He
told
me
that
when
Dain
*NL*
Waris
's
body
was
uncovered
at
a
sign
of
Doramin
's
,
he
whom
they
often
*NL*
called
the
white
lord
's
friend
was
disclosed
lying
unchanged
with
his
*NL*
eyelids
a
little
open
as
if
about
to
wake
.
Doramin
leaned
forward
a
*NL*
little
more
,
like
one
looking
for
something
fallen
on
the
ground
.
His
*NL*
eyes
searched
the
body
from
its
feet
to
its
head
,
for
the
wound
maybe
.
*NL*
It
was
in
the
forehead
and
small
;
and
there
was
no
word
spoken
while
*NL*
one
of
the
by-standers
,
stooping
,
took
off
the
silver
ring
from
the
cold
*NL*
stiff
hand
.
In
silence
he
held
it
up
before
Doramin
.
A
murmur
of
dismay
*NL*
and
horror
ran
through
the
crowd
at
the
sight
of
that
familiar
token
.
*NL*
The
old
nakhoda
stared
at
it
,
and
suddenly
let
out
one
great
fierce
cry
,
*NL*
deep
from
the
chest
,
a
roar
of
pain
and
fury
,
as
mighty
as
the
bellow
of
*NL*
a
wounded
bull
,
bringing
great
fear
into
men
's
hearts
,
by
the
magnitude
*NL*
of
his
anger
and
his
sorrow
that
could
be
plainly
discerned
without
*NL*
words
.
There
was
a
great
stillness
afterwards
for
a
space
,
while
the
*NL*
body
was
being
borne
aside
by
four
men
.
They
laid
it
down
under
a
tree
,
*NL*
and
on
the
instant
,
with
one
long
shriek
,
all
the
women
of
the
household
*NL*
began
to
wail
together
;
they
mourned
with
shrill
cries
;
the
sun
*NL*
was
setting
,
and
in
the
intervals
of
screamed
lamentations
the
high
*NL*
sing-song
voices
of
two
old
men
intoning
the
Koran
chanted
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
About
this
time
Jim
,
leaning
on
a
gun-carriage
,
looked
at
the
river
,
*NL*
and
turned
his
back
on
the
house
;
and
the
girl
,
in
the
doorway
,
panting
*NL*
as
if
she
had
run
herself
to
a
standstill
,
was
looking
at
him
across
the
*NL*
yard
.
Tamb
'
Itam
stood
not
far
from
his
master
,
waiting
patiently
for
*NL*
what
might
happen
.
All
at
once
Jim
,
who
seemed
to
be
lost
in
quiet
*NL*
thought
,
turned
to
him
and
said
,
``
Time
to
finish
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Tuan
?
''
said
Tamb
'
Itam
,
advancing
with
alacrity
.
He
did
not
know
what
*NL*
his
master
meant
,
but
as
soon
as
Jim
made
a
movement
the
girl
started
*NL*
too
and
walked
down
into
the
open
space
.
It
seems
that
no
one
else
of
*NL*
the
people
of
the
house
was
in
sight
.
She
tottered
slightly
,
and
about
*NL*
half-way
down
called
out
to
Jim
,
who
had
apparently
resumed
his
peaceful
*NL*
contemplation
of
the
river
.
He
turned
round
,
setting
his
back
against
*NL*
the
gun
.
``
Will
you
fight
?
''
she
cried
.
``
There
is
nothing
to
fight
for
,
''
*NL*
he
said
;
``
nothing
is
lost
.
''
Saying
this
he
made
a
step
towards
her
.
*NL*
``
Will
you
fly
?
''
she
cried
again
.
``
There
is
no
escape
,
''
he
said
,
stopping
*NL*
short
,
and
she
stood
still
also
,
silent
,
devouring
him
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
``
And
you
shall
go
?
''
she
said
slowly
.
He
bent
his
head
.
``
Ah
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
,
peering
at
him
as
it
were
,
``
you
are
mad
or
false
.
Do
you
*NL*
remember
the
night
I
prayed
you
to
leave
me
,
and
you
said
that
you
could
*NL*
not
?
That
it
was
impossible
!
Impossible
!
Do
you
remember
you
said
you
*NL*
would
never
leave
me
?
Why
?
I
asked
you
for
no
promise
.
You
promised
*NL*
unasked
--
remember
.
''
``
Enough
,
poor
girl
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
should
not
be
worth
*NL*
having
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
said
that
while
they
were
talking
she
would
laugh
loud
and
*NL*
senselessly
like
one
under
the
visitation
of
God
.
His
master
put
his
*NL*
hands
to
his
head
.
He
was
fully
dressed
as
for
every
day
,
but
without
*NL*
a
hat
.
She
stopped
laughing
suddenly
.
``
For
the
last
time
,
''
she
cried
*NL*
menacingly
,
``
will
you
defend
yourself
?
''
``
Nothing
can
touch
me
,
''
he
said
*NL*
in
a
last
flicker
of
superb
egoism
.
Tamb
'
Itam
saw
her
lean
forward
*NL*
where
she
stood
,
open
her
arms
,
and
run
at
him
swiftly
.
She
flung
*NL*
herself
upon
his
breast
and
clasped
him
round
the
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
Ah
!
but
I
shall
hold
thee
thus
,
''
she
cried
...
``
Thou
art
mine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
`
She
sobbed
on
his
shoulder
.
The
sky
over
Patusan
was
blood-red
,
*NL*
immense
,
streaming
like
an
open
vein
.
An
enormous
sun
nestled
crimson
*NL*
amongst
the
tree-tops
,
and
the
forest
below
had
a
black
and
forbidding
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
tells
me
that
on
that
evening
the
aspect
of
the
heavens
was
*NL*
angry
and
frightful
.
I
may
well
believe
it
,
for
I
know
that
on
that
very
*NL*
day
a
cyclone
passed
within
sixty
miles
of
the
coast
,
though
there
was
*NL*
hardly
more
than
a
languid
stir
of
air
in
the
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Suddenly
Tamb
'
Itam
saw
Jim
catch
her
arms
,
trying
to
unclasp
her
*NL*
hands
.
She
hung
on
them
with
her
head
fallen
back
;
her
hair
touched
the
*NL*
ground
.
``
Come
here
!
''
his
master
called
,
and
Tamb
'
Itam
helped
to
ease
*NL*
her
down
.
It
was
difficult
to
separate
her
fingers
.
Jim
,
bending
*NL*
over
her
,
looked
earnestly
upon
her
face
,
and
all
at
once
ran
to
the
*NL*
landing-stage
.
Tamb
'
Itam
followed
him
,
but
turning
his
head
,
he
saw
*NL*
that
she
had
struggled
up
to
her
feet
.
She
ran
after
them
a
few
steps
,
*NL*
then
fell
down
heavily
on
her
knees
.
``
Tuan
!
Tuan
!
''
called
Tamb
'
Itam
,
*NL*
``
look
back
;
''
but
Jim
was
already
in
a
canoe
,
standing
up
paddle
in
hand
.
*NL*
He
did
not
look
back
.
Tamb
'
Itam
had
just
time
to
scramble
in
after
*NL*
him
when
the
canoe
floated
clear
.
The
girl
was
then
on
her
knees
,
with
*NL*
clasped
hands
,
at
the
water-gate
.
She
remained
thus
for
a
time
in
*NL*
a
supplicating
attitude
before
she
sprang
up
.
``
You
are
false
!
''
she
*NL*
screamed
out
after
Jim
.
``
Forgive
me
,
''
he
cried
.
``
Never
!
Never
!
''
she
*NL*
called
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Tamb
'
Itam
took
the
paddle
from
Jim
's
hands
,
it
being
unseemly
that
he
*NL*
should
sit
while
his
lord
paddled
.
When
they
reached
the
other
shore
his
*NL*
master
forbade
him
to
come
any
farther
;
but
Tamb
'
Itam
did
follow
him
at
*NL*
a
distance
,
walking
up
the
slope
to
Doramin
's
campong
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
It
was
beginning
to
grow
dark
.
Torches
twinkled
here
and
there
.
Those
*NL*
they
met
seemed
awestruck
,
and
stood
aside
hastily
to
let
Jim
pass
.
The
*NL*
wailing
of
women
came
from
above
.
The
courtyard
was
full
of
armed
Bugis
*NL*
with
their
followers
,
and
of
Patusan
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
I
do
not
know
what
this
gathering
really
meant
.
Were
these
preparations
*NL*
for
war
,
or
for
vengeance
,
or
to
repulse
a
threatened
invasion
?
Many
*NL*
days
elapsed
before
the
people
had
ceased
to
look
out
,
quaking
,
for
*NL*
the
return
of
the
white
men
with
long
beards
and
in
rags
,
whose
exact
*NL*
relation
to
their
own
white
man
they
could
never
understand
.
Even
for
*NL*
those
simple
minds
poor
Jim
remains
under
a
cloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Doramin
,
alone
!
immense
and
desolate
,
sat
in
his
arm-chair
with
the
*NL*
pair
of
flintlock
pistols
on
his
knees
,
faced
by
a
armed
throng
.
When
*NL*
Jim
appeared
,
at
somebody
's
exclamation
,
all
the
heads
turned
round
*NL*
together
,
and
then
the
mass
opened
right
and
left
,
and
he
walked
up
a
*NL*
lane
of
averted
glances
.
Whispers
followed
him
;
murmurs
:
``
He
has
worked
*NL*
all
the
evil
.
''
``
He
hath
a
charm
.
''
...
He
heard
them
--
perhaps
!
*NL*
*NL*
`
When
he
came
up
into
the
light
of
torches
the
wailing
of
the
women
*NL*
ceased
suddenly
.
Doramin
did
not
lift
his
head
,
and
Jim
stood
silent
*NL*
before
him
for
a
time
.
Then
he
looked
to
the
left
,
and
moved
in
that
*NL*
direction
with
measured
steps
.
Dain
Waris
's
mother
crouched
at
the
head
*NL*
of
the
body
,
and
the
grey
dishevelled
hair
concealed
her
face
.
Jim
came
*NL*
up
slowly
,
looked
at
his
dead
friend
,
lifting
the
sheet
,
than
dropped
it
*NL*
without
a
word
.
Slowly
he
walked
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
'
``
He
came
!
He
came
!
''
was
running
from
lip
to
lip
,
making
a
murmur
to
*NL*
which
he
moved
.
``
He
hath
taken
it
upon
his
own
head
,
''
a
voice
said
*NL*
aloud
.
He
heard
this
and
turned
to
the
crowd
.
``
Yes
.
Upon
my
head
.
''
A
few
*NL*
people
recoiled
.
Jim
waited
awhile
before
Doramin
,
and
then
said
gently
,
*NL*
``
I
am
come
in
sorrow
.
''
He
waited
again
.
``
I
am
come
ready
and
unarmed
,
''
*NL*
he
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
unwieldy
old
man
,
lowering
his
big
forehead
like
an
ox
under
a
*NL*
yoke
,
made
an
effort
to
rise
,
clutching
at
the
flintlock
pistols
on
his
*NL*
knees
.
From
his
throat
came
gurgling
,
choking
,
inhuman
sounds
,
and
his
*NL*
two
attendants
helped
him
from
behind
.
People
remarked
that
the
ring
*NL*
which
he
had
dropped
on
his
lap
fell
and
rolled
against
the
foot
of
*NL*
the
white
man
,
and
that
poor
Jim
glanced
down
at
the
talisman
that
had
*NL*
opened
for
him
the
door
of
fame
,
love
,
and
success
within
the
wall
of
*NL*
forests
fringed
with
white
foam
,
within
the
coast
that
under
the
western
*NL*
sun
looks
like
the
very
stronghold
of
the
night
.
Doramin
,
struggling
to
*NL*
keep
his
feet
,
made
with
his
two
supporters
a
swaying
,
tottering
group
;
*NL*
his
little
eyes
stared
with
an
expression
of
mad
pain
,
of
rage
,
with
*NL*
a
ferocious
glitter
,
which
the
bystanders
noticed
;
and
then
,
while
Jim
*NL*
stood
stiffened
and
with
bared
head
in
the
light
of
torches
,
looking
him
*NL*
straight
in
the
face
,
he
clung
heavily
with
his
left
arm
round
the
neck
*NL*
of
a
bowed
youth
,
and
lifting
deliberately
his
right
,
shot
his
son
's
*NL*
friend
through
the
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
The
crowd
,
which
had
fallen
apart
behind
Jim
as
soon
as
Doramin
had
*NL*
raised
his
hand
,
rushed
tumultuously
forward
after
the
shot
.
They
say
*NL*
that
the
white
man
sent
right
and
left
at
all
those
faces
a
proud
and
*NL*
unflinching
glance
.
Then
with
his
hand
over
his
lips
he
fell
forward
,
*NL*
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
And
that
's
the
end
.
He
passes
away
under
a
cloud
,
inscrutable
at
heart
,
*NL*
forgotten
,
unforgiven
,
and
excessively
romantic
.
Not
in
the
wildest
days
*NL*
of
his
boyish
visions
could
he
have
seen
the
alluring
shape
of
such
an
*NL*
extraordinary
success
!
For
it
may
very
well
be
that
in
the
short
moment
*NL*
of
his
last
proud
and
unflinching
glance
,
he
had
beheld
the
face
of
that
*NL*
opportunity
which
,
like
an
Eastern
bride
,
had
come
veiled
to
his
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
But
we
can
see
him
,
an
obscure
conqueror
of
fame
,
tearing
himself
out
*NL*
of
the
arms
of
a
jealous
love
at
the
sign
,
at
the
call
of
his
exalted
*NL*
egoism
.
He
goes
away
from
a
living
woman
to
celebrate
his
pitiless
*NL*
wedding
with
a
shadowy
ideal
of
conduct
.
Is
he
satisfied
--
quite
,
now
,
I
*NL*
wonder
?
We
ought
to
know
.
He
is
one
of
us
--
and
have
I
not
stood
up
once
,
*NL*
like
an
evoked
ghost
,
to
answer
for
his
eternal
constancy
?
Was
I
so
very
*NL*
wrong
after
all
?
Now
he
is
no
more
,
there
are
days
when
the
reality
of
*NL*
his
existence
comes
to
me
with
an
immense
,
with
an
overwhelming
force
;
*NL*
and
yet
upon
my
honour
there
are
moments
,
too
when
he
passes
from
my
*NL*
eyes
like
a
disembodied
spirit
astray
amongst
the
passions
of
this
*NL*
earth
,
ready
to
surrender
himself
faithfully
to
the
claim
of
his
own
*NL*
world
of
shades
.
*NL*
*NL*
`
Who
knows
?
He
is
gone
,
inscrutable
at
heart
,
and
the
poor
girl
is
*NL*
leading
a
sort
of
soundless
,
inert
life
in
Stein
's
house
.
Stein
has
*NL*
aged
greatly
of
late
.
He
feels
it
himself
,
and
says
often
that
he
is
*NL*
``
preparing
to
leave
all
this
;
preparing
to
leave
...
''
while
he
waves
*NL*
his
hand
sadly
at
his
butterflies
.
