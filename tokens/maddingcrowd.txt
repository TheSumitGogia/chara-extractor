PREFACE
*NL*
*NL*
In
reprinting
this
story
for
a
new
edition
I
am
reminded
that
it
was
*NL*
in
the
chapters
of
``
Far
from
the
Madding
Crowd
,
''
as
they
appeared
*NL*
month
by
month
in
a
popular
magazine
,
that
I
first
ventured
to
adopt
*NL*
the
word
``
Wessex
''
from
the
pages
of
early
English
history
,
and
give
*NL*
it
a
fictitious
significance
as
the
existing
name
of
the
district
*NL*
once
included
in
that
extinct
kingdom
.
The
series
of
novels
I
*NL*
projected
being
mainly
of
the
kind
called
local
,
they
seemed
to
*NL*
require
a
territorial
definition
of
some
sort
to
lend
unity
to
their
*NL*
scene
.
Finding
that
the
area
of
a
single
county
did
not
afford
a
*NL*
canvas
large
enough
for
this
purpose
,
and
that
there
were
objections
*NL*
to
an
invented
name
,
I
disinterred
the
old
one
.
The
press
and
the
*NL*
public
were
kind
enough
to
welcome
the
fanciful
plan
,
and
willingly
*NL*
joined
me
in
the
anachronism
of
imagining
a
Wessex
population
living
*NL*
under
Queen
Victoria
;
--
a
modern
Wessex
of
railways
,
the
penny
post
,
*NL*
mowing
and
reaping
machines
,
union
workhouses
,
lucifer
matches
,
*NL*
labourers
who
could
read
and
write
,
and
National
school
children
.
*NL*
But
I
believe
I
am
correct
in
stating
that
,
until
the
existence
of
*NL*
this
contemporaneous
Wessex
was
announced
in
the
present
story
,
in
*NL*
1874
,
it
had
never
been
heard
of
,
and
that
the
expression
,
``
a
Wessex
*NL*
peasant
,
''
or
``
a
Wessex
custom
,
''
would
theretofore
have
been
taken
to
*NL*
refer
to
nothing
later
in
date
than
the
Norman
Conquest
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
did
not
anticipate
that
this
application
of
the
word
to
a
modern
*NL*
use
would
extend
outside
the
chapters
of
my
own
chronicles
.
But
the
*NL*
name
was
soon
taken
up
elsewhere
as
a
local
designation
.
The
first
*NL*
to
do
so
was
the
now
defunct
_
Examiner
_
,
which
,
in
the
impression
*NL*
bearing
date
July
15
,
1876
,
entitled
one
of
its
articles
``
The
Wessex
*NL*
Labourer
,
''
the
article
turning
out
to
be
no
dissertation
on
farming
*NL*
during
the
Heptarchy
,
but
on
the
modern
peasant
of
the
south-west
*NL*
counties
,
and
his
presentation
in
these
stories
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
then
the
appellation
which
I
had
thought
to
reserve
to
the
*NL*
horizons
and
landscapes
of
a
merely
realistic
dream-country
,
has
*NL*
become
more
and
more
popular
as
a
practical
definition
;
and
the
*NL*
dream-country
has
,
by
degrees
,
solidified
into
a
utilitarian
region
*NL*
which
people
can
go
to
,
take
a
house
in
,
and
write
to
the
papers
*NL*
from
.
But
I
ask
all
good
and
gentle
readers
to
be
so
kind
as
to
*NL*
forget
this
,
and
to
refuse
steadfastly
to
believe
that
there
are
any
*NL*
inhabitants
of
a
Victorian
Wessex
outside
the
pages
of
this
and
the
*NL*
companion
volumes
in
which
they
were
first
discovered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Moreover
,
the
village
called
Weatherbury
,
wherein
the
scenes
of
the
*NL*
present
story
of
the
series
are
for
the
most
part
laid
,
would
perhaps
*NL*
be
hardly
discernible
by
the
explorer
,
without
help
,
in
any
existing
*NL*
place
nowadays
;
though
at
the
time
,
comparatively
recent
,
at
which
*NL*
the
tale
was
written
,
a
sufficient
reality
to
meet
the
descriptions
,
*NL*
both
of
backgrounds
and
personages
,
might
have
been
traced
easily
*NL*
enough
.
The
church
remains
,
by
great
good
fortune
,
unrestored
and
*NL*
intact
,
and
a
few
of
the
old
houses
;
but
the
ancient
malt-house
,
*NL*
which
was
formerly
so
characteristic
of
the
parish
,
has
been
pulled
*NL*
down
these
twenty
years
;
also
most
of
the
thatched
and
dormered
*NL*
cottages
that
were
once
lifeholds
.
The
game
of
prisoner
's
base
,
*NL*
which
not
so
long
ago
seemed
to
enjoy
a
perennial
vitality
in
front
*NL*
of
the
worn-out
stocks
,
may
,
so
far
as
I
can
say
,
be
entirely
unknown
*NL*
to
the
rising
generation
of
schoolboys
there
.
The
practice
of
*NL*
divination
by
Bible
and
key
,
the
regarding
of
valentines
as
things
of
*NL*
serious
import
,
the
shearing-supper
,
and
the
harvest-home
,
have
,
too
,
*NL*
nearly
disappeared
in
the
wake
of
the
old
houses
;
and
with
them
have
*NL*
gone
,
it
is
said
,
much
of
that
love
of
fuddling
to
which
the
village
*NL*
at
one
time
was
notoriously
prone
.
The
change
at
the
root
of
this
*NL*
has
been
the
recent
supplanting
of
the
class
of
stationary
cottagers
,
*NL*
who
carried
on
the
local
traditions
and
humours
,
by
a
population
*NL*
of
more
or
less
migratory
labourers
,
which
has
led
to
a
break
of
*NL*
continuity
in
local
history
,
more
fatal
than
any
other
thing
to
the
*NL*
preservation
of
legend
,
folk-lore
,
close
inter-social
relations
,
and
*NL*
eccentric
individualities
.
For
these
the
indispensable
conditions
*NL*
of
existence
are
attachment
to
the
soil
of
one
particular
spot
by
*NL*
generation
after
generation
.

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DESCRIPTION
OF
FARMER
OAK
--
AN
INCIDENT
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Farmer
Oak
smiled
,
the
corners
of
his
mouth
spread
till
they
*NL*
were
within
an
unimportant
distance
of
his
ears
,
his
eyes
were
*NL*
reduced
to
chinks
,
and
diverging
wrinkles
appeared
round
them
,
*NL*
extending
upon
his
countenance
like
the
rays
in
a
rudimentary
sketch
*NL*
of
the
rising
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
Christian
name
was
Gabriel
,
and
on
working
days
he
was
a
young
*NL*
man
of
sound
judgment
,
easy
motions
,
proper
dress
,
and
general
good
*NL*
character
.
On
Sundays
he
was
a
man
of
misty
views
,
rather
given
to
*NL*
postponing
,
and
hampered
by
his
best
clothes
and
umbrella
:
upon
the
*NL*
whole
,
one
who
felt
himself
to
occupy
morally
that
vast
middle
space
*NL*
of
Laodicean
neutrality
which
lay
between
the
Communion
people
of
*NL*
the
parish
and
the
drunken
section
,
--
that
is
,
he
went
to
church
,
but
*NL*
yawned
privately
by
the
time
the
congregation
reached
the
Nicene
*NL*
creed
,
and
thought
of
what
there
would
be
for
dinner
when
he
meant
to
*NL*
be
listening
to
the
sermon
.
Or
,
to
state
his
character
as
it
stood
*NL*
in
the
scale
of
public
opinion
,
when
his
friends
and
critics
were
in
*NL*
tantrums
,
he
was
considered
rather
a
bad
man
;
when
they
were
pleased
,
*NL*
he
was
rather
a
good
man
;
when
they
were
neither
,
he
was
a
man
whose
*NL*
moral
colour
was
a
kind
of
pepper-and-salt
mixture
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
he
lived
six
times
as
many
working-days
as
Sundays
,
Oak
's
*NL*
appearance
in
his
old
clothes
was
most
peculiarly
his
own
--
the
mental
*NL*
picture
formed
by
his
neighbours
in
imagining
him
being
always
*NL*
dressed
in
that
way
.
He
wore
a
low-crowned
felt
hat
,
spread
out
at
*NL*
the
base
by
tight
jamming
upon
the
head
for
security
in
high
winds
,
*NL*
and
a
coat
like
Dr.
Johnson
's
;
his
lower
extremities
being
encased
*NL*
in
ordinary
leather
leggings
and
boots
emphatically
large
,
affording
*NL*
to
each
foot
a
roomy
apartment
so
constructed
that
any
wearer
might
*NL*
stand
in
a
river
all
day
long
and
know
nothing
of
damp
--
their
maker
*NL*
being
a
conscientious
man
who
endeavoured
to
compensate
for
any
*NL*
weakness
in
his
cut
by
unstinted
dimension
and
solidity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Oak
carried
about
him
,
by
way
of
watch
,
what
may
be
called
a
*NL*
small
silver
clock
;
in
other
words
,
it
was
a
watch
as
to
shape
and
*NL*
intention
,
and
a
small
clock
as
to
size
.
This
instrument
being
*NL*
several
years
older
than
Oak
's
grandfather
,
had
the
peculiarity
of
*NL*
going
either
too
fast
or
not
at
all
.
The
smaller
of
its
hands
,
too
,
*NL*
occasionally
slipped
round
on
the
pivot
,
and
thus
,
though
the
minutes
*NL*
were
told
with
precision
,
nobody
could
be
quite
certain
of
the
hour
*NL*
they
belonged
to
.
The
stopping
peculiarity
of
his
watch
Oak
remedied
*NL*
by
thumps
and
shakes
,
and
he
escaped
any
evil
consequences
from
the
*NL*
other
two
defects
by
constant
comparisons
with
and
observations
of
*NL*
the
sun
and
stars
,
and
by
pressing
his
face
close
to
the
glass
of
his
*NL*
neighbours
'
windows
,
till
he
could
discern
the
hour
marked
by
the
*NL*
green-faced
timekeepers
within
.
It
may
be
mentioned
that
Oak
's
fob
*NL*
being
difficult
of
access
,
by
reason
of
its
somewhat
high
situation
*NL*
in
the
waistband
of
his
trousers
-LRB-
which
also
lay
at
a
remote
height
*NL*
under
his
waistcoat
-RRB-
,
the
watch
was
as
a
necessity
pulled
out
by
*NL*
throwing
the
body
to
one
side
,
compressing
the
mouth
and
face
to
a
*NL*
mere
mass
of
ruddy
flesh
on
account
of
the
exertion
required
,
and
*NL*
drawing
up
the
watch
by
its
chain
,
like
a
bucket
from
a
well
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
some
thoughtful
persons
,
who
had
seen
him
walking
across
one
*NL*
of
his
fields
on
a
certain
December
morning
--
sunny
and
exceedingly
*NL*
mild
--
might
have
regarded
Gabriel
Oak
in
other
aspects
than
these
.
*NL*
In
his
face
one
might
notice
that
many
of
the
hues
and
curves
of
*NL*
youth
had
tarried
on
to
manhood
:
there
even
remained
in
his
remoter
*NL*
crannies
some
relics
of
the
boy
.
His
height
and
breadth
would
*NL*
have
been
sufficient
to
make
his
presence
imposing
,
had
they
been
*NL*
exhibited
with
due
consideration
.
But
there
is
a
way
some
men
have
,
*NL*
rural
and
urban
alike
,
for
which
the
mind
is
more
responsible
than
*NL*
flesh
and
sinew
:
it
is
a
way
of
curtailing
their
dimensions
by
their
*NL*
manner
of
showing
them
.
And
from
a
quiet
modesty
that
would
have
*NL*
become
a
vestal
,
which
seemed
continually
to
impress
upon
him
that
he
*NL*
had
no
great
claim
on
the
world
's
room
,
Oak
walked
unassumingly
and
*NL*
with
a
faintly
perceptible
bend
,
yet
distinct
from
a
bowing
of
the
*NL*
shoulders
.
This
may
be
said
to
be
a
defect
in
an
individual
if
he
*NL*
depends
for
his
valuation
more
upon
his
appearance
than
upon
his
*NL*
capacity
to
wear
well
,
which
Oak
did
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
just
reached
the
time
of
life
at
which
``
young
''
is
ceasing
to
*NL*
be
the
prefix
of
``
man
''
in
speaking
of
one
.
He
was
at
the
brightest
*NL*
period
of
masculine
growth
,
for
his
intellect
and
his
emotions
were
*NL*
clearly
separated
:
he
had
passed
the
time
during
which
the
influence
*NL*
of
youth
indiscriminately
mingles
them
in
the
character
of
impulse
,
*NL*
and
he
had
not
yet
arrived
at
the
stage
wherein
they
become
united
*NL*
again
,
in
the
character
of
prejudice
,
by
the
influence
of
a
wife
and
*NL*
family
.
In
short
,
he
was
twenty-eight
,
and
a
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
field
he
was
in
this
morning
sloped
to
a
ridge
called
Norcombe
*NL*
Hill
.
Through
a
spur
of
this
hill
ran
the
highway
between
Emminster
*NL*
and
Chalk-Newton
.
Casually
glancing
over
the
hedge
,
Oak
saw
coming
*NL*
down
the
incline
before
him
an
ornamental
spring
waggon
,
painted
*NL*
yellow
and
gaily
marked
,
drawn
by
two
horses
,
a
waggoner
walking
*NL*
alongside
bearing
a
whip
perpendicularly
.
The
waggon
was
laden
with
*NL*
household
goods
and
window
plants
,
and
on
the
apex
of
the
whole
sat
*NL*
a
woman
,
young
and
attractive
.
Gabriel
had
not
beheld
the
sight
for
*NL*
more
than
half
a
minute
,
when
the
vehicle
was
brought
to
a
standstill
*NL*
just
beneath
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tailboard
of
the
waggon
is
gone
,
Miss
,
''
said
the
waggoner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
heard
it
fall
,
''
said
the
girl
,
in
a
soft
,
though
not
*NL*
particularly
low
voice
.
``
I
heard
a
noise
I
could
not
account
for
*NL*
when
we
were
coming
up
the
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
run
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
,
''
she
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sensible
horses
stood
--
perfectly
still
,
and
the
waggoner
's
steps
*NL*
sank
fainter
and
fainter
in
the
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
on
the
summit
of
the
load
sat
motionless
,
surrounded
by
*NL*
tables
and
chairs
with
their
legs
upwards
,
backed
by
an
oak
settle
,
*NL*
and
ornamented
in
front
by
pots
of
geraniums
,
myrtles
,
and
cactuses
,
*NL*
together
with
a
caged
canary
--
all
probably
from
the
windows
of
the
*NL*
house
just
vacated
.
There
was
also
a
cat
in
a
willow
basket
,
from
*NL*
the
partly-opened
lid
of
which
she
gazed
with
half-closed
eyes
,
and
*NL*
affectionately
surveyed
the
small
birds
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
girl
waited
for
some
time
idly
in
her
place
,
and
the
*NL*
only
sound
heard
in
the
stillness
was
the
hopping
of
the
canary
up
*NL*
and
down
the
perches
of
its
prison
.
Then
she
looked
attentively
*NL*
downwards
.
It
was
not
at
the
bird
,
nor
at
the
cat
;
it
was
at
an
*NL*
oblong
package
tied
in
paper
,
and
lying
between
them
.
She
turned
her
*NL*
head
to
learn
if
the
waggoner
were
coming
.
He
was
not
yet
in
sight
;
*NL*
and
her
eyes
crept
back
to
the
package
,
her
thoughts
seeming
to
run
*NL*
upon
what
was
inside
it
.
At
length
she
drew
the
article
into
her
*NL*
lap
,
and
untied
the
paper
covering
;
a
small
swing
looking-glass
was
*NL*
disclosed
,
in
which
she
proceeded
to
survey
herself
attentively
.
She
*NL*
parted
her
lips
and
smiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fine
morning
,
and
the
sun
lighted
up
to
a
scarlet
glow
the
*NL*
crimson
jacket
she
wore
,
and
painted
a
soft
lustre
upon
her
bright
*NL*
face
and
dark
hair
.
The
myrtles
,
geraniums
,
and
cactuses
packed
*NL*
around
her
were
fresh
and
green
,
and
at
such
a
leafless
season
they
*NL*
invested
the
whole
concern
of
horses
,
waggon
,
furniture
,
and
girl
*NL*
with
a
peculiar
vernal
charm
.
What
possessed
her
to
indulge
in
*NL*
such
a
performance
in
the
sight
of
the
sparrows
,
blackbirds
,
and
*NL*
unperceived
farmer
who
were
alone
its
spectators
,
--
whether
the
smile
*NL*
began
as
a
factitious
one
,
to
test
her
capacity
in
that
art
,
--
nobody
*NL*
knows
;
it
ended
certainly
in
a
real
smile
.
She
blushed
at
herself
,
*NL*
and
seeing
her
reflection
blush
,
blushed
the
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
change
from
the
customary
spot
and
necessary
occasion
of
such
an
*NL*
act
--
from
the
dressing
hour
in
a
bedroom
to
a
time
of
travelling
out
*NL*
of
doors
--
lent
to
the
idle
deed
a
novelty
it
did
not
intrinsically
*NL*
possess
.
The
picture
was
a
delicate
one
.
Woman
's
prescriptive
*NL*
infirmity
had
stalked
into
the
sunlight
,
which
had
clothed
it
in
the
*NL*
freshness
of
an
originality
.
A
cynical
inference
was
irresistible
by
*NL*
Gabriel
Oak
as
he
regarded
the
scene
,
generous
though
he
fain
would
*NL*
have
been
.
There
was
no
necessity
whatever
for
her
looking
in
the
*NL*
glass
.
She
did
not
adjust
her
hat
,
or
pat
her
hair
,
or
press
a
*NL*
dimple
into
shape
,
or
do
one
thing
to
signify
that
any
such
intention
*NL*
had
been
her
motive
in
taking
up
the
glass
.
She
simply
observed
*NL*
herself
as
a
fair
product
of
Nature
in
the
feminine
kind
,
her
*NL*
thoughts
seeming
to
glide
into
far-off
though
likely
dramas
in
which
*NL*
men
would
play
a
part
--
vistas
of
probable
triumphs
--
the
smiles
being
*NL*
of
a
phase
suggesting
that
hearts
were
imagined
as
lost
and
won
.
*NL*
Still
,
this
was
but
conjecture
,
and
the
whole
series
of
actions
was
*NL*
so
idly
put
forth
as
to
make
it
rash
to
assert
that
intention
had
any
*NL*
part
in
them
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
waggoner
's
steps
were
heard
returning
.
She
put
the
glass
in
the
*NL*
paper
,
and
the
whole
again
into
its
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
waggon
had
passed
on
,
Gabriel
withdrew
from
his
point
of
*NL*
espial
,
and
descending
into
the
road
,
followed
the
vehicle
to
the
*NL*
turnpike-gate
some
way
beyond
the
bottom
of
the
hill
,
where
the
*NL*
object
of
his
contemplation
now
halted
for
the
payment
of
toll
.
*NL*
About
twenty
steps
still
remained
between
him
and
the
gate
,
when
he
*NL*
heard
a
dispute
.
It
was
a
difference
concerning
twopence
between
the
*NL*
persons
with
the
waggon
and
the
man
at
the
toll-bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mis
`
ess
's
niece
is
upon
the
top
of
the
things
,
and
she
says
that
's
*NL*
enough
that
I
've
offered
ye
,
you
great
miser
,
and
she
wo
n't
pay
any
*NL*
more
.
''
These
were
the
waggoner
's
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
then
mis
`
ess
's
niece
ca
n't
pass
,
''
said
the
turnpike-keeper
,
*NL*
closing
the
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
looked
from
one
to
the
other
of
the
disputants
,
and
fell
into
*NL*
a
reverie
.
There
was
something
in
the
tone
of
twopence
remarkably
*NL*
insignificant
.
Threepence
had
a
definite
value
as
money
--
it
was
an
*NL*
appreciable
infringement
on
a
day
's
wages
,
and
,
as
such
,
a
higgling
*NL*
matter
;
but
twopence
--
``
Here
,
''
he
said
,
stepping
forward
and
handing
*NL*
twopence
to
the
gatekeeper
;
``
let
the
young
woman
pass
.
''
He
looked
up
*NL*
at
her
then
;
she
heard
his
words
,
and
looked
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
's
features
adhered
throughout
their
form
so
exactly
to
the
*NL*
middle
line
between
the
beauty
of
St.
John
and
the
ugliness
of
Judas
*NL*
Iscariot
,
as
represented
in
a
window
of
the
church
he
attended
,
that
*NL*
not
a
single
lineament
could
be
selected
and
called
worthy
either
of
*NL*
distinction
or
notoriety
.
The
red-jacketed
and
dark-haired
maiden
*NL*
seemed
to
think
so
too
,
for
she
carelessly
glanced
over
him
,
and
told
*NL*
her
man
to
drive
on
.
She
might
have
looked
her
thanks
to
Gabriel
on
*NL*
a
minute
scale
,
but
she
did
not
speak
them
;
more
probably
she
felt
*NL*
none
,
for
in
gaining
her
a
passage
he
had
lost
her
her
point
,
and
we
*NL*
know
how
women
take
a
favour
of
that
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gatekeeper
surveyed
the
retreating
vehicle
.
``
That
's
a
*NL*
handsome
maid
,
''
he
said
to
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
has
her
faults
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
farmer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
greatest
of
them
is
--
well
,
what
it
is
always
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Beating
people
down
?
ay
,
't
is
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
,
perhaps
a
little
piqued
by
the
comely
traveller
's
*NL*
indifference
,
glanced
back
to
where
he
had
witnessed
her
performance
*NL*
over
the
hedge
,
and
said
,
``
Vanity
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NIGHT
--
THE
FLOCK
--
AN
INTERIOR
--
ANOTHER
INTERIOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
nearly
midnight
on
the
eve
of
St.
Thomas
's
,
the
shortest
day
*NL*
in
the
year
.
A
desolating
wind
wandered
from
the
north
over
the
hill
*NL*
whereon
Oak
had
watched
the
yellow
waggon
and
its
occupant
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
of
a
few
days
earlier
.
*NL*
*NL*
Norcombe
Hill
--
not
far
from
lonely
Toller-Down
--
was
one
of
the
spots
*NL*
which
suggest
to
a
passer-by
that
he
is
in
the
presence
of
a
shape
*NL*
approaching
the
indestructible
as
nearly
as
any
to
be
found
on
*NL*
earth
.
It
was
a
featureless
convexity
of
chalk
and
soil
--
an
ordinary
*NL*
specimen
of
those
smoothly-outlined
protuberances
of
the
globe
which
*NL*
may
remain
undisturbed
on
some
great
day
of
confusion
,
when
far
*NL*
grander
heights
and
dizzy
granite
precipices
topple
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hill
was
covered
on
its
northern
side
by
an
ancient
and
decaying
*NL*
plantation
of
beeches
,
whose
upper
verge
formed
a
line
over
the
*NL*
crest
,
fringing
its
arched
curve
against
the
sky
,
like
a
mane
.
*NL*
To-night
these
trees
sheltered
the
southern
slope
from
the
keenest
*NL*
blasts
,
which
smote
the
wood
and
floundered
through
it
with
a
sound
*NL*
as
of
grumbling
,
or
gushed
over
its
crowning
boughs
in
a
weakened
*NL*
moan
.
The
dry
leaves
in
the
ditch
simmered
and
boiled
in
the
same
*NL*
breezes
,
a
tongue
of
air
occasionally
ferreting
out
a
few
,
and
*NL*
sending
them
spinning
across
the
grass
.
A
group
or
two
of
the
latest
*NL*
in
date
amongst
the
dead
multitude
had
remained
till
this
very
*NL*
mid-winter
time
on
the
twigs
which
bore
them
and
in
falling
rattled
*NL*
against
the
trunks
with
smart
taps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
this
half-wooded
half-naked
hill
,
and
the
vague
still
horizon
*NL*
that
its
summit
indistinctly
commanded
,
was
a
mysterious
sheet
of
*NL*
fathomless
shade
--
the
sounds
from
which
suggested
that
what
it
*NL*
concealed
bore
some
reduced
resemblance
to
features
here
.
The
thin
*NL*
grasses
,
more
or
less
coating
the
hill
,
were
touched
by
the
wind
in
*NL*
breezes
of
differing
powers
,
and
almost
of
differing
natures
--
one
*NL*
rubbing
the
blades
heavily
,
another
raking
them
piercingly
,
another
*NL*
brushing
them
like
a
soft
broom
.
The
instinctive
act
of
humankind
*NL*
was
to
stand
and
listen
,
and
learn
how
the
trees
on
the
right
and
the
*NL*
trees
on
the
left
wailed
or
chaunted
to
each
other
in
the
regular
*NL*
antiphonies
of
a
cathedral
choir
;
how
hedges
and
other
shapes
to
*NL*
leeward
then
caught
the
note
,
lowering
it
to
the
tenderest
sob
;
and
*NL*
how
the
hurrying
gust
then
plunged
into
the
south
,
to
be
heard
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sky
was
clear
--
remarkably
clear
--
and
the
twinkling
of
all
the
*NL*
stars
seemed
to
be
but
throbs
of
one
body
,
timed
by
a
common
pulse
.
*NL*
The
North
Star
was
directly
in
the
wind
's
eye
,
and
since
evening
the
*NL*
Bear
had
swung
round
it
outwardly
to
the
east
,
till
he
was
now
at
*NL*
a
right
angle
with
the
meridian
.
A
difference
of
colour
in
the
*NL*
stars
--
oftener
read
of
than
seen
in
England
--
was
really
perceptible
*NL*
here
.
The
sovereign
brilliancy
of
Sirius
pierced
the
eye
with
a
*NL*
steely
glitter
,
the
star
called
Capella
was
yellow
,
Aldebaran
and
*NL*
Betelgueux
shone
with
a
fiery
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
persons
standing
alone
on
a
hill
during
a
clear
midnight
such
as
*NL*
this
,
the
roll
of
the
world
eastward
is
almost
a
palpable
movement
.
*NL*
The
sensation
may
be
caused
by
the
panoramic
glide
of
the
stars
past
*NL*
earthly
objects
,
which
is
perceptible
in
a
few
minutes
of
stillness
,
*NL*
or
by
the
better
outlook
upon
space
that
a
hill
affords
,
or
by
the
*NL*
wind
,
or
by
the
solitude
;
but
whatever
be
its
origin
,
the
impression
*NL*
of
riding
along
is
vivid
and
abiding
.
The
poetry
of
motion
is
a
*NL*
phrase
much
in
use
,
and
to
enjoy
the
epic
form
of
that
gratification
*NL*
it
is
necessary
to
stand
on
a
hill
at
a
small
hour
of
the
night
,
*NL*
and
,
having
first
expanded
with
a
sense
of
difference
from
the
mass
*NL*
of
civilised
mankind
,
who
are
dreamwrapt
and
disregardful
of
all
*NL*
such
proceedings
at
this
time
,
long
and
quietly
watch
your
stately
*NL*
progress
through
the
stars
.
After
such
a
nocturnal
reconnoitre
it
is
*NL*
hard
to
get
back
to
earth
,
and
to
believe
that
the
consciousness
of
*NL*
such
majestic
speeding
is
derived
from
a
tiny
human
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
an
unexpected
series
of
sounds
began
to
be
heard
in
this
*NL*
place
up
against
the
sky
.
They
had
a
clearness
which
was
to
be
found
*NL*
nowhere
in
the
wind
,
and
a
sequence
which
was
to
be
found
nowhere
in
*NL*
nature
.
They
were
the
notes
of
Farmer
Oak
's
flute
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tune
was
not
floating
unhindered
into
the
open
air
:
it
seemed
*NL*
muffled
in
some
way
,
and
was
altogether
too
curtailed
in
power
to
*NL*
spread
high
or
wide
.
It
came
from
the
direction
of
a
small
dark
*NL*
object
under
the
plantation
hedge
--
a
shepherd
's
hut
--
now
presenting
*NL*
an
outline
to
which
an
uninitiated
person
might
have
been
puzzled
*NL*
to
attach
either
meaning
or
use
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
image
as
a
whole
was
that
of
a
small
Noah
's
Ark
on
a
small
*NL*
Ararat
,
allowing
the
traditionary
outlines
and
general
form
of
*NL*
the
Ark
which
are
followed
by
toy-makers
--
and
by
these
means
are
*NL*
established
in
men
's
imaginations
among
their
firmest
,
because
*NL*
earliest
impressions
--
to
pass
as
an
approximate
pattern
.
The
hut
*NL*
stood
on
little
wheels
,
which
raised
its
floor
about
a
foot
from
the
*NL*
ground
.
Such
shepherds
'
huts
are
dragged
into
the
fields
when
the
*NL*
lambing
season
comes
on
,
to
shelter
the
shepherd
in
his
enforced
*NL*
nightly
attendance
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
latterly
that
people
had
begun
to
call
Gabriel
``
Farmer
''
*NL*
Oak
.
During
the
twelvemonth
preceding
this
time
he
had
been
enabled
*NL*
by
sustained
efforts
of
industry
and
chronic
good
spirits
to
lease
*NL*
the
small
sheep-farm
of
which
Norcombe
Hill
was
a
portion
,
and
stock
*NL*
it
with
two
hundred
sheep
.
Previously
he
had
been
a
bailiff
for
a
*NL*
short
time
,
and
earlier
still
a
shepherd
only
,
having
from
his
*NL*
childhood
assisted
his
father
in
tending
the
flocks
of
large
*NL*
proprietors
,
till
old
Gabriel
sank
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
venture
,
unaided
and
alone
,
into
the
paths
of
farming
as
master
*NL*
and
not
as
man
,
with
an
advance
of
sheep
not
yet
paid
for
,
was
a
*NL*
critical
juncture
with
Gabriel
Oak
,
and
he
recognised
his
position
*NL*
clearly
.
The
first
movement
in
his
new
progress
was
the
lambing
of
*NL*
his
ewes
,
and
sheep
having
been
his
speciality
from
his
youth
,
he
*NL*
wisely
refrained
from
deputing
the
task
of
tending
them
at
this
*NL*
season
to
a
hireling
or
a
novice
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wind
continued
to
beat
about
the
corners
of
the
hut
,
but
the
*NL*
flute-playing
ceased
.
A
rectangular
space
of
light
appeared
in
the
*NL*
side
of
the
hut
,
and
in
the
opening
the
outline
of
Farmer
Oak
's
*NL*
figure
.
He
carried
a
lantern
in
his
hand
,
and
closing
the
door
*NL*
behind
him
,
came
forward
and
busied
himself
about
this
nook
of
the
*NL*
field
for
nearly
twenty
minutes
,
the
lantern
light
appearing
and
*NL*
disappearing
here
and
there
,
and
brightening
him
or
darkening
him
*NL*
as
he
stood
before
or
behind
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
's
motions
,
though
they
had
a
quiet-energy
,
were
slow
,
and
their
*NL*
deliberateness
accorded
well
with
his
occupation
.
Fitness
being
the
*NL*
basis
of
beauty
,
nobody
could
have
denied
that
his
steady
swings
and
*NL*
turns
in
and
about
the
flock
had
elements
of
grace
.
Yet
,
although
if
*NL*
occasion
demanded
he
could
do
or
think
a
thing
with
as
mercurial
a
*NL*
dash
as
can
the
men
of
towns
who
are
more
to
the
manner
born
,
his
*NL*
special
power
,
morally
,
physically
,
and
mentally
,
was
static
,
owing
*NL*
little
or
nothing
to
momentum
as
a
rule
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
close
examination
of
the
ground
hereabout
,
even
by
the
wan
*NL*
starlight
only
,
revealed
how
a
portion
of
what
would
have
been
*NL*
casually
called
a
wild
slope
had
been
appropriated
by
Farmer
Oak
for
*NL*
his
great
purpose
this
winter
.
Detached
hurdles
thatched
with
straw
*NL*
were
stuck
into
the
ground
at
various
scattered
points
,
amid
and
*NL*
under
which
the
whitish
forms
of
his
meek
ewes
moved
and
rustled
.
*NL*
The
ring
of
the
sheep-bell
,
which
had
been
silent
during
his
absence
,
*NL*
recommenced
,
in
tones
that
had
more
mellowness
than
clearness
,
owing
*NL*
to
an
increasing
growth
of
surrounding
wool
.
This
continued
till
Oak
*NL*
withdrew
again
from
the
flock
.
He
returned
to
the
hut
,
bringing
in
*NL*
his
arms
a
new-born
lamb
,
consisting
of
four
legs
large
enough
for
*NL*
a
full-grown
sheep
,
united
by
a
seemingly
inconsiderable
membrane
*NL*
about
half
the
substance
of
the
legs
collectively
,
which
constituted
*NL*
the
animal
's
entire
body
just
at
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
speck
of
life
he
placed
on
a
wisp
of
hay
before
the
small
*NL*
stove
,
where
a
can
of
milk
was
simmering
.
Oak
extinguished
the
*NL*
lantern
by
blowing
into
it
and
then
pinching
the
snuff
,
the
cot
being
*NL*
lighted
by
a
candle
suspended
by
a
twisted
wire
.
A
rather
hard
*NL*
couch
,
formed
of
a
few
corn
sacks
thrown
carelessly
down
,
covered
*NL*
half
the
floor
of
this
little
habitation
,
and
here
the
young
man
*NL*
stretched
himself
along
,
loosened
his
woollen
cravat
,
and
closed
his
*NL*
eyes
.
In
about
the
time
a
person
unaccustomed
to
bodily
labour
would
*NL*
have
decided
upon
which
side
to
lie
,
Farmer
Oak
was
asleep
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inside
of
the
hut
,
as
it
now
presented
itself
,
was
cosy
and
*NL*
alluring
,
and
the
scarlet
handful
of
fire
in
addition
to
the
candle
,
*NL*
reflecting
its
own
genial
colour
upon
whatever
it
could
reach
,
flung
*NL*
associations
of
enjoyment
even
over
utensils
and
tools
.
In
the
*NL*
corner
stood
the
sheep-crook
,
and
along
a
shelf
at
one
side
were
*NL*
ranged
bottles
and
canisters
of
the
simple
preparations
pertaining
to
*NL*
ovine
surgery
and
physic
;
spirits
of
wine
,
turpentine
,
tar
,
magnesia
,
*NL*
ginger
,
and
castor-oil
being
the
chief
.
On
a
triangular
shelf
across
*NL*
the
corner
stood
bread
,
bacon
,
cheese
,
and
a
cup
for
ale
or
cider
,
*NL*
which
was
supplied
from
a
flagon
beneath
.
Beside
the
provisions
lay
*NL*
the
flute
,
whose
notes
had
lately
been
called
forth
by
the
lonely
*NL*
watcher
to
beguile
a
tedious
hour
.
The
house
was
ventilated
by
two
*NL*
round
holes
,
like
the
lights
of
a
ship
's
cabin
,
with
wood
slides
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lamb
,
revived
by
the
warmth
began
to
bleat
,
and
the
sound
entered
*NL*
Gabriel
's
ears
and
brain
with
an
instant
meaning
,
as
expected
*NL*
sounds
will
.
Passing
from
the
profoundest
sleep
to
the
most
alert
*NL*
wakefulness
with
the
same
ease
that
had
accompanied
the
reverse
*NL*
operation
,
he
looked
at
his
watch
,
found
that
the
hour-hand
had
*NL*
shifted
again
,
put
on
his
hat
,
took
the
lamb
in
his
arms
,
and
carried
*NL*
it
into
the
darkness
.
After
placing
the
little
creature
with
its
*NL*
mother
,
he
stood
and
carefully
examined
the
sky
,
to
ascertain
the
*NL*
time
of
night
from
the
altitudes
of
the
stars
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Dog-star
and
Aldebaran
,
pointing
to
the
restless
Pleiades
,
were
*NL*
half-way
up
the
Southern
sky
,
and
between
them
hung
Orion
,
which
*NL*
gorgeous
constellation
never
burnt
more
vividly
than
now
,
as
it
*NL*
soared
forth
above
the
rim
of
the
landscape
.
Castor
and
Pollux
with
*NL*
their
quiet
shine
were
almost
on
the
meridian
:
the
barren
and
gloomy
*NL*
Square
of
Pegasus
was
creeping
round
to
the
north-west
;
far
away
*NL*
through
the
plantation
Vega
sparkled
like
a
lamp
suspended
amid
the
*NL*
leafless
trees
,
and
Cassiopeia
's
chair
stood
daintily
poised
on
the
*NL*
uppermost
boughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
o'clock
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
a
man
not
without
a
frequent
consciousness
that
there
was
some
*NL*
charm
in
this
life
he
led
,
he
stood
still
after
looking
at
the
sky
*NL*
as
a
useful
instrument
,
and
regarded
it
in
an
appreciative
spirit
,
*NL*
as
a
work
of
art
superlatively
beautiful
.
For
a
moment
he
seemed
*NL*
impressed
with
the
speaking
loneliness
of
the
scene
,
or
rather
with
*NL*
the
complete
abstraction
from
all
its
compass
of
the
sights
and
*NL*
sounds
of
man
.
Human
shapes
,
interferences
,
troubles
,
and
joys
*NL*
were
all
as
if
they
were
not
,
and
there
seemed
to
be
on
the
shaded
*NL*
hemisphere
of
the
globe
no
sentient
being
save
himself
;
he
could
*NL*
fancy
them
all
gone
round
to
the
sunny
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
Occupied
thus
,
with
eyes
stretched
afar
,
Oak
gradually
perceived
*NL*
that
what
he
had
previously
taken
to
be
a
star
low
down
behind
the
*NL*
outskirts
of
the
plantation
was
in
reality
no
such
thing
.
It
was
an
*NL*
artificial
light
,
almost
close
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
find
themselves
utterly
alone
at
night
where
company
is
desirable
*NL*
and
expected
makes
some
people
fearful
;
but
a
case
more
trying
by
*NL*
far
to
the
nerves
is
to
discover
some
mysterious
companionship
when
*NL*
intuition
,
sensation
,
memory
,
analogy
,
testimony
,
probability
,
*NL*
induction
--
every
kind
of
evidence
in
the
logician
's
list
--
have
united
*NL*
to
persuade
consciousness
that
it
is
quite
in
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farmer
Oak
went
towards
the
plantation
and
pushed
through
its
lower
*NL*
boughs
to
the
windy
side
.
A
dim
mass
under
the
slope
reminded
him
*NL*
that
a
shed
occupied
a
place
here
,
the
site
being
a
cutting
into
the
*NL*
slope
of
the
hill
,
so
that
at
its
back
part
the
roof
was
almost
level
*NL*
with
the
ground
.
In
front
it
was
formed
of
board
nailed
to
posts
and
*NL*
covered
with
tar
as
a
preservative
.
Through
crevices
in
the
roof
and
*NL*
side
spread
streaks
and
dots
of
light
,
a
combination
of
which
made
*NL*
the
radiance
that
had
attracted
him
.
Oak
stepped
up
behind
,
where
,
*NL*
leaning
down
upon
the
roof
and
putting
his
eye
close
to
a
hole
,
he
*NL*
could
see
into
the
interior
clearly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
place
contained
two
women
and
two
cows
.
By
the
side
of
the
*NL*
latter
a
steaming
bran-mash
stood
in
a
bucket
.
One
of
the
women
was
*NL*
past
middle
age
.
Her
companion
was
apparently
young
and
graceful
;
*NL*
he
could
form
no
decided
opinion
upon
her
looks
,
her
position
being
*NL*
almost
beneath
his
eye
,
so
that
he
saw
her
in
a
bird
's
-
eye
view
,
as
*NL*
Milton
's
Satan
first
saw
Paradise
.
She
wore
no
bonnet
or
hat
,
but
*NL*
had
enveloped
herself
in
a
large
cloak
,
which
was
carelessly
flung
*NL*
over
her
head
as
a
covering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
now
we
'll
go
home
,
''
said
the
elder
of
the
two
,
resting
her
*NL*
knuckles
upon
her
hips
,
and
looking
at
their
goings-on
as
a
whole
.
*NL*
``
I
do
hope
Daisy
will
fetch
round
again
now
.
I
have
never
been
more
*NL*
frightened
in
my
life
,
but
I
do
n't
mind
breaking
my
rest
if
she
*NL*
recovers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
,
whose
eyelids
were
apparently
inclined
to
fall
*NL*
together
on
the
smallest
provocation
of
silence
,
yawned
without
*NL*
parting
her
lips
to
any
inconvenient
extent
,
whereupon
Gabriel
caught
*NL*
the
infection
and
slightly
yawned
in
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
were
rich
enough
to
pay
a
man
to
do
these
things
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
we
are
not
,
we
must
do
them
ourselves
,
''
said
the
other
;
``
for
you
*NL*
must
help
me
if
you
stay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
my
hat
is
gone
,
however
,
''
continued
the
younger
.
``
It
went
over
*NL*
the
hedge
,
I
think
.
The
idea
of
such
a
slight
wind
catching
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cow
standing
erect
was
of
the
Devon
breed
,
and
was
encased
in
a
*NL*
tight
warm
hide
of
rich
Indian
red
,
as
absolutely
uniform
from
eyes
*NL*
to
tail
as
if
the
animal
had
been
dipped
in
a
dye
of
that
colour
,
her
*NL*
long
back
being
mathematically
level
.
The
other
was
spotted
,
grey
*NL*
and
white
.
Beside
her
Oak
now
noticed
a
little
calf
about
a
day
old
,
*NL*
looking
idiotically
at
the
two
women
,
which
showed
that
it
had
not
*NL*
long
been
accustomed
to
the
phenomenon
of
eyesight
,
and
often
turning
*NL*
to
the
lantern
,
which
it
apparently
mistook
for
the
moon
,
inherited
*NL*
instinct
having
as
yet
had
little
time
for
correction
by
experience
.
*NL*
Between
the
sheep
and
the
cows
Lucina
had
been
busy
on
Norcombe
Hill
*NL*
lately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
we
had
better
send
for
some
oatmeal
,
''
said
the
elder
woman
;
*NL*
``
there
's
no
more
bran
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
aunt
;
and
I
'll
ride
over
for
it
as
soon
as
it
is
light
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
's
no
side-saddle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
ride
on
the
other
:
trust
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
,
upon
hearing
these
remarks
,
became
more
curious
to
observe
her
*NL*
features
,
but
this
prospect
being
denied
him
by
the
hooding
effect
of
*NL*
the
cloak
,
and
by
his
aerial
position
,
he
felt
himself
drawing
upon
*NL*
his
fancy
for
their
details
.
In
making
even
horizontal
and
clear
*NL*
inspections
we
colour
and
mould
according
to
the
wants
within
us
*NL*
whatever
our
eyes
bring
in
.
Had
Gabriel
been
able
from
the
first
to
*NL*
get
a
distinct
view
of
her
countenance
,
his
estimate
of
it
as
very
*NL*
handsome
or
slightly
so
would
have
been
as
his
soul
required
a
*NL*
divinity
at
the
moment
or
was
ready
supplied
with
one
.
Having
for
*NL*
some
time
known
the
want
of
a
satisfactory
form
to
fill
an
increasing
*NL*
void
within
him
,
his
position
moreover
affording
the
widest
scope
for
*NL*
his
fancy
,
he
painted
her
a
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
one
of
those
whimsical
coincidences
in
which
Nature
,
like
a
busy
*NL*
mother
,
seems
to
spare
a
moment
from
her
unremitting
labours
to
turn
*NL*
and
make
her
children
smile
,
the
girl
now
dropped
the
cloak
,
and
*NL*
forth
tumbled
ropes
of
black
hair
over
a
red
jacket
.
Oak
knew
*NL*
her
instantly
as
the
heroine
of
the
yellow
waggon
,
myrtles
,
and
*NL*
looking-glass
:
prosily
,
as
the
woman
who
owed
him
twopence
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
placed
the
calf
beside
its
mother
again
,
took
up
the
lantern
,
*NL*
and
went
out
,
the
light
sinking
down
the
hill
till
it
was
no
more
*NL*
than
a
nebula
.
Gabriel
Oak
returned
to
his
flock

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
A
GIRL
ON
HORSEBACK
--
CONVERSATION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
sluggish
day
began
to
break
.
Even
its
position
terrestrially
is
*NL*
one
of
the
elements
of
a
new
interest
,
and
for
no
particular
reason
*NL*
save
that
the
incident
of
the
night
had
occurred
there
Oak
went
again
*NL*
into
the
plantation
.
Lingering
and
musing
here
,
he
heard
the
steps
of
*NL*
a
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
,
and
soon
there
appeared
in
view
an
*NL*
auburn
pony
with
a
girl
on
its
back
,
ascending
by
the
path
leading
*NL*
past
the
cattle-shed
.
She
was
the
young
woman
of
the
night
before
.
*NL*
Gabriel
instantly
thought
of
the
hat
she
had
mentioned
as
having
*NL*
lost
in
the
wind
;
possibly
she
had
come
to
look
for
it
.
He
hastily
*NL*
scanned
the
ditch
and
after
walking
about
ten
yards
along
it
found
*NL*
the
hat
among
the
leaves
.
Gabriel
took
it
in
his
hand
and
returned
*NL*
to
his
hut
.
Here
he
ensconced
himself
,
and
peeped
through
the
*NL*
loophole
in
the
direction
of
the
rider
's
approach
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
up
and
looked
around
--
then
on
the
other
side
of
the
hedge
.
*NL*
Gabriel
was
about
to
advance
and
restore
the
missing
article
when
*NL*
an
unexpected
performance
induced
him
to
suspend
the
action
for
*NL*
the
present
.
The
path
,
after
passing
the
cowshed
,
bisected
the
*NL*
plantation
.
It
was
not
a
bridle-path
--
merely
a
pedestrian
's
track
,
*NL*
and
the
boughs
spread
horizontally
at
a
height
not
greater
than
seven
*NL*
feet
above
the
ground
,
which
made
it
impossible
to
ride
erect
beneath
*NL*
them
.
The
girl
,
who
wore
no
riding-habit
,
looked
around
for
a
*NL*
moment
,
as
if
to
assure
herself
that
all
humanity
was
out
of
view
,
*NL*
then
dexterously
dropped
backwards
flat
upon
the
pony
's
back
,
her
*NL*
head
over
its
tail
,
her
feet
against
its
shoulders
,
and
her
eyes
to
*NL*
the
sky
.
The
rapidity
of
her
glide
into
this
position
was
that
of
*NL*
a
kingfisher
--
its
noiselessness
that
of
a
hawk
.
Gabriel
's
eyes
had
*NL*
scarcely
been
able
to
follow
her
.
The
tall
lank
pony
seemed
used
to
*NL*
such
doings
,
and
ambled
along
unconcerned
.
Thus
she
passed
under
the
*NL*
level
boughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
performer
seemed
quite
at
home
anywhere
between
a
horse
's
head
*NL*
and
its
tail
,
and
the
necessity
for
this
abnormal
attitude
having
*NL*
ceased
with
the
passage
of
the
plantation
,
she
began
to
adopt
*NL*
another
,
even
more
obviously
convenient
than
the
first
.
She
had
*NL*
no
side-saddle
,
and
it
was
very
apparent
that
a
firm
seat
upon
the
*NL*
smooth
leather
beneath
her
was
unattainable
sideways
.
Springing
to
*NL*
her
accustomed
perpendicular
like
a
bowed
sapling
,
and
satisfying
*NL*
herself
that
nobody
was
in
sight
,
she
seated
herself
in
the
manner
*NL*
demanded
by
the
saddle
,
though
hardly
expected
of
the
woman
,
and
*NL*
trotted
off
in
the
direction
of
Tewnell
Mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
was
amused
,
perhaps
a
little
astonished
,
and
hanging
up
the
hat
*NL*
in
his
hut
,
went
again
among
his
ewes
.
An
hour
passed
,
the
girl
*NL*
returned
,
properly
seated
now
,
with
a
bag
of
bran
in
front
of
*NL*
her
.
On
nearing
the
cattle-shed
she
was
met
by
a
boy
bringing
a
*NL*
milking-pail
,
who
held
the
reins
of
the
pony
whilst
she
slid
off
.
*NL*
The
boy
led
away
the
horse
,
leaving
the
pail
with
the
young
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
soft
spirts
alternating
with
loud
spirts
came
in
regular
*NL*
succession
from
within
the
shed
,
the
obvious
sounds
of
a
person
*NL*
milking
a
cow
.
Gabriel
took
the
lost
hat
in
his
hand
,
and
waited
*NL*
beside
the
path
she
would
follow
in
leaving
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
,
the
pail
in
one
hand
,
hanging
against
her
knee
.
The
left
*NL*
arm
was
extended
as
a
balance
,
enough
of
it
being
shown
bare
to
make
*NL*
Oak
wish
that
the
event
had
happened
in
the
summer
,
when
the
whole
*NL*
would
have
been
revealed
.
There
was
a
bright
air
and
manner
about
*NL*
her
now
,
by
which
she
seemed
to
imply
that
the
desirability
of
her
*NL*
existence
could
not
be
questioned
;
and
this
rather
saucy
assumption
*NL*
failed
in
being
offensive
because
a
beholder
felt
it
to
be
,
upon
the
*NL*
whole
,
true
.
Like
exceptional
emphasis
in
the
tone
of
a
genius
,
*NL*
that
which
would
have
made
mediocrity
ridiculous
was
an
addition
to
*NL*
recognised
power
.
It
was
with
some
surprise
that
she
saw
Gabriel
's
*NL*
face
rising
like
the
moon
behind
the
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
adjustment
of
the
farmer
's
hazy
conceptions
of
her
charms
to
the
*NL*
portrait
of
herself
she
now
presented
him
with
was
less
a
diminution
*NL*
than
a
difference
.
The
starting-point
selected
by
the
judgment
was
*NL*
her
height
.
She
seemed
tall
,
but
the
pail
was
a
small
one
,
and
the
*NL*
hedge
diminutive
;
hence
,
making
allowance
for
error
by
comparison
*NL*
with
these
,
she
could
have
been
not
above
the
height
to
be
chosen
by
*NL*
women
as
best
.
All
features
of
consequence
were
severe
and
regular
.
*NL*
It
may
have
been
observed
by
persons
who
go
about
the
shires
with
*NL*
eyes
for
beauty
,
that
in
Englishwoman
a
classically-formed
face
is
*NL*
seldom
found
to
be
united
with
a
figure
of
the
same
pattern
,
the
*NL*
highly-finished
features
being
generally
too
large
for
the
remainder
*NL*
of
the
frame
;
that
a
graceful
and
proportionate
figure
of
eight
heads
*NL*
usually
goes
off
into
random
facial
curves
.
Without
throwing
a
*NL*
Nymphean
tissue
over
a
milkmaid
,
let
it
be
said
that
here
criticism
*NL*
checked
itself
as
out
of
place
,
and
looked
at
her
proportions
with
a
*NL*
long
consciousness
of
pleasure
.
From
the
contours
of
her
figure
in
*NL*
its
upper
part
,
she
must
have
had
a
beautiful
neck
and
shoulders
;
but
*NL*
since
her
infancy
nobody
had
ever
seen
them
.
Had
she
been
put
into
*NL*
a
low
dress
she
would
have
run
and
thrust
her
head
into
a
bush
.
Yet
*NL*
she
was
not
a
shy
girl
by
any
means
;
it
was
merely
her
instinct
to
*NL*
draw
the
line
dividing
the
seen
from
the
unseen
higher
than
they
do
*NL*
it
in
towns
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
the
girl
's
thoughts
hovered
about
her
face
and
form
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
caught
Oak
's
eyes
conning
the
same
page
was
natural
,
and
almost
*NL*
certain
.
The
self-consciousness
shown
would
have
been
vanity
if
*NL*
a
little
more
pronounced
,
dignity
if
a
little
less
.
Rays
of
male
*NL*
vision
seem
to
have
a
tickling
effect
upon
virgin
faces
in
rural
*NL*
districts
;
she
brushed
hers
with
her
hand
,
as
if
Gabriel
had
been
*NL*
irritating
its
pink
surface
by
actual
touch
,
and
the
free
air
of
her
*NL*
previous
movements
was
reduced
at
the
same
time
to
a
chastened
phase
*NL*
of
itself
.
Yet
it
was
the
man
who
blushed
,
the
maid
not
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
found
a
hat
,
''
said
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
mine
,
''
said
she
,
and
,
from
a
sense
of
proportion
,
kept
down
to
*NL*
a
small
smile
an
inclination
to
laugh
distinctly
:
``
it
flew
away
last
*NL*
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
o'clock
this
morning
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
it
was
.
''
She
was
surprised
.
``
How
did
you
know
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
Farmer
Oak
,
are
you
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
or
thereabouts
.
I
'm
lately
come
to
this
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
large
farm
?
''
she
inquired
,
casting
her
eyes
round
,
and
swinging
*NL*
back
her
hair
,
which
was
black
in
the
shaded
hollows
of
its
mass
;
but
*NL*
it
being
now
an
hour
past
sunrise
the
rays
touched
its
prominent
*NL*
curves
with
a
colour
of
their
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
large
.
About
a
hundred
.
''
-LRB-
In
speaking
of
farms
the
word
*NL*
``
acres
''
is
omitted
by
the
natives
,
by
analogy
to
such
old
expressions
*NL*
as
``
a
stag
of
ten
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
my
hat
this
morning
,
''
she
went
on
.
``
I
had
to
ride
to
*NL*
Tewnell
Mill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
you
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
saw
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
she
inquired
,
a
misgiving
bringing
every
muscle
of
her
*NL*
lineaments
and
frame
to
a
standstill
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
--
going
through
the
plantation
,
and
all
down
the
hill
,
''
said
*NL*
Farmer
Oak
,
with
an
aspect
excessively
knowing
with
regard
to
some
*NL*
matter
in
his
mind
,
as
he
gazed
at
a
remote
point
in
the
direction
*NL*
named
,
and
then
turned
back
to
meet
his
colloquist
's
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
perception
caused
him
to
withdraw
his
own
eyes
from
hers
as
*NL*
suddenly
as
if
he
had
been
caught
in
a
theft
.
Recollection
of
the
*NL*
strange
antics
she
had
indulged
in
when
passing
through
the
trees
was
*NL*
succeeded
in
the
girl
by
a
nettled
palpitation
,
and
that
by
a
hot
*NL*
face
.
It
was
a
time
to
see
a
woman
redden
who
was
not
given
to
*NL*
reddening
as
a
rule
;
not
a
point
in
the
milkmaid
but
was
of
the
*NL*
deepest
rose-colour
.
From
the
Maiden
's
Blush
,
through
all
varieties
*NL*
of
the
Provence
down
to
the
Crimson
Tuscany
,
the
countenance
of
Oak
's
*NL*
acquaintance
quickly
graduated
;
whereupon
he
,
in
considerateness
,
*NL*
turned
away
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sympathetic
man
still
looked
the
other
way
,
and
wondered
when
she
*NL*
would
recover
coolness
sufficient
to
justify
him
in
facing
her
again
.
*NL*
He
heard
what
seemed
to
be
the
flitting
of
a
dead
leaf
upon
the
*NL*
breeze
,
and
looked
.
She
had
gone
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
air
between
that
of
Tragedy
and
Comedy
Gabriel
returned
to
*NL*
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
Five
mornings
and
evenings
passed
.
The
young
woman
came
regularly
to
*NL*
milk
the
healthy
cow
or
to
attend
to
the
sick
one
,
but
never
allowed
*NL*
her
vision
to
stray
in
the
direction
of
Oak
's
person
.
His
want
of
*NL*
tact
had
deeply
offended
her
--
not
by
seeing
what
he
could
not
help
,
*NL*
but
by
letting
her
know
that
he
had
seen
it
.
For
,
as
without
law
*NL*
there
is
no
sin
,
without
eyes
there
is
no
indecorum
;
and
she
appeared
*NL*
to
feel
that
Gabriel
's
espial
had
made
her
an
indecorous
woman
*NL*
without
her
own
connivance
.
It
was
food
for
great
regret
with
him
;
*NL*
it
was
also
a
_
contretemps
_
which
touched
into
life
a
latent
heat
he
*NL*
had
experienced
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
acquaintanceship
might
,
however
,
have
ended
in
a
slow
forgetting
,
*NL*
but
for
an
incident
which
occurred
at
the
end
of
the
same
week
.
One
*NL*
afternoon
it
began
to
freeze
,
and
the
frost
increased
with
evening
,
*NL*
which
drew
on
like
a
stealthy
tightening
of
bonds
.
It
was
a
time
*NL*
when
in
cottages
the
breath
of
the
sleepers
freezes
to
the
sheets
;
*NL*
when
round
the
drawing-room
fire
of
a
thick-walled
mansion
the
*NL*
sitters
'
backs
are
cold
,
even
whilst
their
faces
are
all
aglow
.
Many
*NL*
a
small
bird
went
to
bed
supperless
that
night
among
the
bare
boughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
milking-hour
drew
near
,
Oak
kept
his
usual
watch
upon
the
*NL*
cowshed
.
At
last
he
felt
cold
,
and
shaking
an
extra
quantity
of
*NL*
bedding
round
the
yearling
ewes
he
entered
the
hut
and
heaped
more
*NL*
fuel
upon
the
stove
.
The
wind
came
in
at
the
bottom
of
the
door
,
*NL*
and
to
prevent
it
Oak
laid
a
sack
there
and
wheeled
the
cot
round
a
*NL*
little
more
to
the
south
.
Then
the
wind
spouted
in
at
a
ventilating
*NL*
hole
--
of
which
there
was
one
on
each
side
of
the
hut
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
had
always
known
that
when
the
fire
was
lighted
and
the
door
*NL*
closed
one
of
these
must
be
kept
open
--
that
chosen
being
always
on
*NL*
the
side
away
from
the
wind
.
Closing
the
slide
to
windward
,
he
*NL*
turned
to
open
the
other
;
on
second
thoughts
the
farmer
considered
*NL*
that
he
would
first
sit
down
leaving
both
closed
for
a
minute
or
two
,
*NL*
till
the
temperature
of
the
hut
was
a
little
raised
.
He
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
head
began
to
ache
in
an
unwonted
manner
,
and
,
fancying
himself
*NL*
weary
by
reason
of
the
broken
rests
of
the
preceding
nights
,
Oak
*NL*
decided
to
get
up
,
open
the
slide
,
and
then
allow
himself
to
fall
*NL*
asleep
.
He
fell
asleep
,
however
,
without
having
performed
the
*NL*
necessary
preliminary
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
long
he
remained
unconscious
Gabriel
never
knew
.
During
the
*NL*
first
stages
of
his
return
to
perception
peculiar
deeds
seemed
to
be
*NL*
in
course
of
enactment
.
His
dog
was
howling
,
his
head
was
aching
*NL*
fearfully
--
somebody
was
pulling
him
about
,
hands
were
loosening
his
*NL*
neckerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
opening
his
eyes
he
found
that
evening
had
sunk
to
dusk
in
*NL*
a
strange
manner
of
unexpectedness
.
The
young
girl
with
the
*NL*
remarkably
pleasant
lips
and
white
teeth
was
beside
him
.
More
than
*NL*
this
--
astonishingly
more
--
his
head
was
upon
her
lap
,
his
face
and
*NL*
neck
were
disagreeably
wet
,
and
her
fingers
were
unbuttoning
his
*NL*
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
is
the
matter
?
''
said
Oak
,
vacantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
seemed
to
experience
mirth
,
but
of
too
insignificant
a
kind
to
*NL*
start
enjoyment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
now
,
''
she
answered
,
``
since
you
are
not
dead
.
It
is
a
wonder
*NL*
you
were
not
suffocated
in
this
hut
of
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
the
hut
!
''
murmured
Gabriel
.
``
I
gave
ten
pounds
for
that
hut
.
*NL*
But
I
'll
sell
it
,
and
sit
under
thatched
hurdles
as
they
did
in
old
*NL*
times
,
and
curl
up
to
sleep
in
a
lock
of
straw
!
It
played
me
nearly
*NL*
the
same
trick
the
other
day
!
''
Gabriel
,
by
way
of
emphasis
,
brought
*NL*
down
his
fist
upon
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
not
exactly
the
fault
of
the
hut
,
''
she
observed
in
a
tone
*NL*
which
showed
her
to
be
that
novelty
among
women
--
one
who
finished
a
*NL*
thought
before
beginning
the
sentence
which
was
to
convey
it
.
``
You
*NL*
should
,
I
think
,
have
considered
,
and
not
have
been
so
foolish
as
to
*NL*
leave
the
slides
closed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
I
suppose
I
should
,
''
said
Oak
,
absently
.
He
was
endeavouring
to
*NL*
catch
and
appreciate
the
sensation
of
being
thus
with
her
,
his
head
*NL*
upon
her
dress
,
before
the
event
passed
on
into
the
heap
of
bygone
*NL*
things
.
He
wished
she
knew
his
impressions
;
but
he
would
as
soon
*NL*
have
thought
of
carrying
an
odour
in
a
net
as
of
attempting
to
convey
*NL*
the
intangibilities
of
his
feeling
in
the
coarse
meshes
of
language
.
*NL*
So
he
remained
silent
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
him
sit
up
,
and
then
Oak
began
wiping
his
face
and
shaking
*NL*
himself
like
a
Samson
.
``
How
can
I
thank
`
ee
?
''
he
said
at
last
,
*NL*
gratefully
,
some
of
the
natural
rusty
red
having
returned
to
his
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
never
mind
that
,
''
said
the
girl
,
smiling
,
and
allowing
her
smile
*NL*
to
hold
good
for
Gabriel
's
next
remark
,
whatever
that
might
prove
to
*NL*
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
find
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
your
dog
howling
and
scratching
at
the
door
of
the
hut
when
*NL*
I
came
to
the
milking
-LRB-
it
was
so
lucky
,
Daisy
's
milking
is
almost
*NL*
over
for
the
season
,
and
I
shall
not
come
here
after
this
week
or
the
*NL*
next
-RRB-
.
The
dog
saw
me
,
and
jumped
over
to
me
,
and
laid
hold
of
my
*NL*
skirt
.
I
came
across
and
looked
round
the
hut
the
very
first
thing
*NL*
to
see
if
the
slides
were
closed
.
My
uncle
has
a
hut
like
this
one
,
*NL*
and
I
have
heard
him
tell
his
shepherd
not
to
go
to
sleep
without
*NL*
leaving
a
slide
open
.
I
opened
the
door
,
and
there
you
were
like
*NL*
dead
.
I
threw
the
milk
over
you
,
as
there
was
no
water
,
forgetting
*NL*
it
was
warm
,
and
no
use
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
I
should
have
died
?
''
Gabriel
said
,
in
a
low
voice
,
which
*NL*
was
rather
meant
to
travel
back
to
himself
than
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
''
the
girl
replied
.
She
seemed
to
prefer
a
less
tragic
*NL*
probability
;
to
have
saved
a
man
from
death
involved
talk
that
should
*NL*
harmonise
with
the
dignity
of
such
a
deed
--
and
she
shunned
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
saved
my
life
,
Miss
--
I
do
n't
know
your
name
.
I
know
*NL*
your
aunt
's
,
but
not
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
just
as
soon
not
tell
it
--
rather
not
.
There
is
no
reason
*NL*
either
why
I
should
,
as
you
probably
will
never
have
much
to
do
with
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
I
should
like
to
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
inquire
at
my
aunt
's
--
she
will
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
name
is
Gabriel
Oak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
mine
is
n't
.
You
seem
fond
of
yours
in
speaking
it
so
*NL*
decisively
,
Gabriel
Oak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
it
is
the
only
one
I
shall
ever
have
,
and
I
must
make
the
*NL*
most
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
always
think
mine
sounds
odd
and
disagreeable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
you
might
soon
get
a
new
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mercy
!
--
how
many
opinions
you
keep
about
you
concerning
other
*NL*
people
,
Gabriel
Oak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Miss
--
excuse
the
words
--
I
thought
you
would
like
them

But
I
*NL*
ca
n't
match
you
,
I
know
,
in
mapping
out
my
mind
upon
my
tongue

I
*NL*
never
was
very
clever
in
my
inside
.
But
I
thank
you
.
Come
,
give
me
*NL*
your
hand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hesitated
,
somewhat
disconcerted
at
Oak
's
old-fashioned
earnest
*NL*
conclusion
to
a
dialogue
lightly
carried
on
.
``
Very
well
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
and
gave
him
her
hand
,
compressing
her
lips
to
a
demure
*NL*
impassivity
.
He
held
it
but
an
instant
,
and
in
his
fear
of
being
too
*NL*
demonstrative
,
swerved
to
the
opposite
extreme
,
touching
her
fingers
*NL*
with
the
lightness
of
a
small-hearted
person
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
,
''
he
said
the
instant
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Letting
your
hand
go
so
quick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
have
it
again
if
you
like
;
there
it
is
.
''
She
gave
him
her
*NL*
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
held
it
longer
this
time
--
indeed
,
curiously
long
.
``
How
soft
it
*NL*
is
--
being
winter
time
,
too
--
not
chapped
or
rough
or
anything
!
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
that
's
long
enough
,
''
said
she
,
though
without
pulling
it
*NL*
away
.
``
But
I
suppose
you
are
thinking
you
would
like
to
kiss
it
?
You
*NL*
may
if
you
want
to

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
n't
thinking
of
any
such
thing

said
Gabriel
,
simply
;
``
but
I
*NL*
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
you

''
She
snatched
back
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
felt
himself
guilty
of
another
want
of
tact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
find
out
my

she
said
,
teasingly
;
and
withdrew

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
GABRIEL
'S
RESOLVE
--
THE
VISIT
--
THE
MISTAKE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
superiority
in
women
that
is
tolerable
to
the
rival
sex
is
,
*NL*
as
a
rule
,
that
of
the
unconscious
kind
;
but
a
superiority
which
*NL*
recognizes
itself
may
sometimes
please
by
suggesting
possibilities
*NL*
of
capture
to
the
subordinated
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
well-favoured
and
comely
girl
soon
made
appreciable
inroads
upon
*NL*
the
emotional
constitution
of
young
Farmer
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Love
,
being
an
extremely
exacting
usurer
-LRB-
a
sense
of
exorbitant
*NL*
profit
,
spiritually
,
by
an
exchange
of
hearts
,
being
at
the
bottom
of
*NL*
pure
passions
,
as
that
of
exorbitant
profit
,
bodily
or
materially
,
*NL*
is
at
the
bottom
of
those
of
lower
atmosphere
-RRB-
,
every
morning
Oak
's
*NL*
feelings
were
as
sensitive
as
the
money-market
in
calculations
upon
*NL*
his
chances
.
His
dog
waited
for
his
meals
in
a
way
so
like
that
in
*NL*
which
Oak
waited
for
the
girl
's
presence
,
that
the
farmer
was
quite
*NL*
struck
with
the
resemblance
,
felt
it
lowering
,
and
would
not
look
at
*NL*
the
dog
.
However
,
he
continued
to
watch
through
the
hedge
for
her
*NL*
regular
coming
,
and
thus
his
sentiments
towards
her
were
deepened
*NL*
without
any
corresponding
effect
being
produced
upon
herself
.
Oak
*NL*
had
nothing
finished
and
ready
to
say
as
yet
,
and
not
being
able
to
*NL*
frame
love
phrases
which
end
where
they
begin
;
passionate
tales
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
--
Full
of
sound
and
fury
*NL*
--
Signifying
nothing
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
he
said
no
word
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
making
inquiries
he
found
that
the
girl
's
name
was
Bathsheba
*NL*
Everdene
,
and
that
the
cow
would
go
dry
in
about
seven
days
.
He
*NL*
dreaded
the
eighth
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
the
eighth
day
came
.
The
cow
had
ceased
to
give
milk
for
*NL*
that
year
,
and
Bathsheba
Everdene
came
up
the
hill
no
more
.
Gabriel
*NL*
had
reached
a
pitch
of
existence
he
never
could
have
anticipated
*NL*
a
short
time
before
.
He
liked
saying
``
Bathsheba
''
as
a
private
*NL*
enjoyment
instead
of
whistling
;
turned
over
his
taste
to
black
hair
,
*NL*
though
he
had
sworn
by
brown
ever
since
he
was
a
boy
,
isolated
*NL*
himself
till
the
space
he
filled
in
the
public
eye
was
contemptibly
*NL*
small
.
Love
is
a
possible
strength
in
an
actual
weakness
.
Marriage
*NL*
transforms
a
distraction
into
a
support
,
the
power
of
which
should
*NL*
be
,
and
happily
often
is
,
in
direct
proportion
to
the
degree
of
*NL*
imbecility
it
supplants
.
Oak
began
now
to
see
light
in
this
*NL*
direction
,
and
said
to
himself
,
``
I
'll
make
her
my
wife
,
or
upon
my
*NL*
soul
I
shall
be
good
for
nothing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
while
he
was
perplexing
himself
about
an
errand
on
which
he
*NL*
might
consistently
visit
the
cottage
of
Bathsheba
's
aunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
his
opportunity
in
the
death
of
a
ewe
,
mother
of
a
living
*NL*
lamb
.
On
a
day
which
had
a
summer
face
and
a
winter
constitution
--
a
*NL*
fine
January
morning
,
when
there
was
just
enough
blue
sky
visible
*NL*
to
make
cheerfully-disposed
people
wish
for
more
,
and
an
occasional
*NL*
gleam
of
silvery
sunshine
,
Oak
put
the
lamb
into
a
respectable
Sunday
*NL*
basket
,
and
stalked
across
the
fields
to
the
house
of
Mrs.
Hurst
,
the
*NL*
aunt
--
George
,
the
dog
walking
behind
,
with
a
countenance
of
great
*NL*
concern
at
the
serious
turn
pastoral
affairs
seemed
to
be
taking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
had
watched
the
blue
wood-smoke
curling
from
the
chimney
with
*NL*
strange
meditation
.
At
evening
he
had
fancifully
traced
it
down
the
*NL*
chimney
to
the
spot
of
its
origin
--
seen
the
hearth
and
Bathsheba
*NL*
beside
it
--
beside
it
in
her
out-door
dress
;
for
the
clothes
she
had
*NL*
worn
on
the
hill
were
by
association
equally
with
her
person
included
*NL*
in
the
compass
of
his
affection
;
they
seemed
at
this
early
time
of
*NL*
his
love
a
necessary
ingredient
of
the
sweet
mixture
called
Bathsheba
*NL*
Everdene
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
made
a
toilet
of
a
nicely-adjusted
kind
--
of
a
nature
between
*NL*
the
carefully
neat
and
the
carelessly
ornate
--
of
a
degree
between
*NL*
fine-market-day
and
wet-Sunday
selection
.
He
thoroughly
cleaned
his
*NL*
silver
watch-chain
with
whiting
,
put
new
lacing
straps
to
his
boots
,
*NL*
looked
to
the
brass
eyelet-holes
,
went
to
the
inmost
heart
of
the
*NL*
plantation
for
a
new
walking-stick
,
and
trimmed
it
vigorously
on
his
*NL*
way
back
;
took
a
new
handkerchief
from
the
bottom
of
his
clothes-box
,
*NL*
put
on
the
light
waistcoat
patterned
all
over
with
sprigs
of
an
*NL*
elegant
flower
uniting
the
beauties
of
both
rose
and
lily
without
the
*NL*
defects
of
either
,
and
used
all
the
hair-oil
he
possessed
upon
his
*NL*
usually
dry
,
sandy
,
and
inextricably
curly
hair
,
till
he
had
deepened
*NL*
it
to
a
splendidly
novel
colour
,
between
that
of
guano
and
Roman
*NL*
cement
,
making
it
stick
to
his
head
like
mace
round
a
nutmeg
,
or
wet
*NL*
seaweed
round
a
boulder
after
the
ebb
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
cottage
save
the
chatter
of
a
*NL*
knot
of
sparrows
on
the
eaves
;
one
might
fancy
scandal
and
rumour
to
*NL*
be
no
less
the
staple
topic
of
these
little
coteries
on
roofs
than
of
*NL*
those
under
them
.
It
seemed
that
the
omen
was
an
unpropitious
one
,
*NL*
for
,
as
the
rather
untoward
commencement
of
Oak
's
overtures
,
just
*NL*
as
he
arrived
by
the
garden
gate
,
he
saw
a
cat
inside
,
going
into
*NL*
various
arched
shapes
and
fiendish
convulsions
at
the
sight
of
his
*NL*
dog
George
.
The
dog
took
no
notice
,
for
he
had
arrived
at
an
age
at
*NL*
which
all
superfluous
barking
was
cynically
avoided
as
a
waste
of
*NL*
breath
--
in
fact
,
he
never
barked
even
at
the
sheep
except
to
order
,
*NL*
when
it
was
done
with
an
absolutely
neutral
countenance
,
as
a
sort
of
*NL*
Commination-service
,
which
,
though
offensive
,
had
to
be
gone
through
*NL*
once
now
and
then
to
frighten
the
flock
for
their
own
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
voice
came
from
behind
some
laurel-bushes
into
which
the
cat
had
*NL*
run
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dear
!
Did
a
nasty
brute
of
a
dog
want
to
kill
it
;
--
did
he
,
*NL*
poor
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
beg
your
pardon
,
''
said
Oak
to
the
voice
,
``
but
George
was
walking
*NL*
on
behind
me
with
a
temper
as
mild
as
milk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
before
he
had
ceased
speaking
,
Oak
was
seized
with
a
misgiving
*NL*
as
to
whose
ear
was
the
recipient
of
his
answer
.
Nobody
appeared
,
and
*NL*
he
heard
the
person
retreat
among
the
bushes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
meditated
,
and
so
deeply
that
he
brought
small
furrows
into
*NL*
his
forehead
by
sheer
force
of
reverie
.
Where
the
issue
of
an
*NL*
interview
is
as
likely
to
be
a
vast
change
for
the
worse
as
for
*NL*
the
better
,
any
initial
difference
from
expectation
causes
nipping
*NL*
sensations
of
failure
.
Oak
went
up
to
the
door
a
little
abashed
:
*NL*
his
mental
rehearsal
and
the
reality
had
had
no
common
grounds
of
*NL*
opening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
aunt
was
indoors
.
``
Will
you
tell
Miss
Everdene
that
*NL*
somebody
would
be
glad
to
speak
to
her
?
''
said
Mr.
Oak

Calling
*NL*
one
's
self
merely
Somebody
,
without
giving
a
name
,
is
not
to
be
taken
*NL*
as
an
example
of
the
ill-breeding
of
the
rural
world
:
it
springs
*NL*
from
a
refined
modesty
,
of
which
townspeople
,
with
their
cards
and
*NL*
announcements
,
have
no
notion
whatever
.

*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
out
.
The
voice
had
evidently
been
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
come
in
,
Mr.
Oak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
thank
`
ee
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
following
her
to
the
fireplace
.
``
I
've
*NL*
brought
a
lamb
for
Miss
Everdene
.
I
thought
she
might
like
one
to
*NL*
rear
;
girls
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
might
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurst
,
musingly
;
``
though
she
's
only
a
visitor
*NL*
here
.
If
you
will
wait
a
minute
,
Bathsheba
will
be
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
wait
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
sitting
down
.
``
The
lamb
is
n't
*NL*
really
the
business
I
came
about
,
Mrs.
Hurst
.
In
short
,
I
was
going
*NL*
to
ask
her
if
she
'd
like
to
be
married
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
were
you
indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Because
if
she
would
,
I
should
be
very
glad
to
marry
her
.
*NL*
D'ye
know
if
she
's
got
any
other
young
man
hanging
about
her
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
think
,
''
said
Mrs.
Hurst
,
poking
the
fire
superfluously
...
*NL*
``
Yes
--
bless
you
,
ever
so
many
young
men
.
You
see
,
Farmer
Oak
,
she
's
*NL*
so
good-looking
,
and
an
excellent
scholar
besides
--
she
was
going
to
*NL*
be
a
governess
once
,
you
know
,
only
she
was
too
wild
.
Not
that
her
*NL*
young
men
ever
come
here
--
but
,
Lord
,
in
the
nature
of
women
,
she
must
*NL*
have
a
dozen
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
unfortunate
,
''
said
Farmer
Oak
,
contemplating
a
crack
in
the
*NL*
stone
floor
with
sorrow
.
``
I
'm
only
an
every-day
sort
of
man
,
and
my
*NL*
only
chance
was
in
being
the
first
comer
...
Well
,
there
's
no
use
in
*NL*
my
waiting
,
for
that
was
all
I
came
about
:
so
I
'll
take
myself
off
*NL*
home-along
,
Mrs.
Hurst
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Gabriel
had
gone
about
two
hundred
yards
along
the
down
,
he
*NL*
heard
a
``
hoi-hoi
!
''
uttered
behind
him
,
in
a
piping
note
of
more
*NL*
treble
quality
than
that
in
which
the
exclamation
usually
embodies
*NL*
itself
when
shouted
across
a
field
.
He
looked
round
,
and
saw
a
girl
*NL*
racing
after
him
,
waving
a
white
handkerchief
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
stood
still
--
and
the
runner
drew
nearer
.
It
was
Bathsheba
*NL*
Everdene
.
Gabriel
's
colour
deepened
:
hers
was
already
deep
,
not
,
as
*NL*
it
appeared
,
from
emotion
,
but
from
running
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farmer
Oak
--
I
--
''
she
said
,
pausing
for
want
of
breath
pulling
up
in
*NL*
front
of
him
with
a
slanted
face
and
putting
her
hand
to
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
called
to
see
you
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
pending
her
further
*NL*
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
know
that
,
''
she
said
panting
like
a
robin
,
her
face
red
and
*NL*
moist
from
her
exertions
,
like
a
peony
petal
before
the
sun
dries
off
*NL*
the
dew
.
``
I
did
n't
know
you
had
come
to
ask
to
have
me
,
or
I
should
*NL*
have
come
in
from
the
garden
instantly
.
I
ran
after
you
to
say
--
that
*NL*
my
aunt
made
a
mistake
in
sending
you
away
from
courting
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
expanded
.
``
I
'm
sorry
to
have
made
you
run
so
fast
,
my
dear
,
''
*NL*
he
said
,
with
a
grateful
sense
of
favours
to
come
.
``
Wait
a
bit
till
*NL*
you
've
found
your
breath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
It
was
quite
a
mistake
--
aunt
's
telling
you
I
had
a
young
man
*NL*
already
,
''
Bathsheba
went
on
.
``
I
have
n't
a
sweetheart
at
all
--
and
I
*NL*
never
had
one
,
and
I
thought
that
,
as
times
go
with
women
,
it
was
*NL*
SUCH
a
pity
to
send
you
away
thinking
that
I
had
several
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
and
truly
I
am
glad
to
hear
that
!
''
said
Farmer
Oak
,
smiling
*NL*
one
of
his
long
special
smiles
,
and
blushing
with
gladness
.
He
held
*NL*
out
his
hand
to
take
hers
,
which
,
when
she
had
eased
her
side
by
*NL*
pressing
it
there
,
was
prettily
extended
upon
her
bosom
to
still
her
*NL*
loud-beating
heart
.
Directly
he
seized
it
she
put
it
behind
her
,
so
*NL*
that
it
slipped
through
his
fingers
like
an
eel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
a
nice
snug
little
farm
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
with
half
a
degree
*NL*
less
assurance
than
when
he
had
seized
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
has
advanced
me
money
to
begin
with
,
but
still
,
it
will
soon
*NL*
be
paid
off
,
and
though
I
am
only
an
every-day
sort
of
man
,
I
have
*NL*
got
on
a
little
since
I
was
a
boy
.
''
Gabriel
uttered
``
a
little
''
in
a
*NL*
tone
to
show
her
that
it
was
the
complacent
form
of
``
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
He
continued
:
``
When
we
be
married
,
I
am
quite
sure
I
can
work
twice
*NL*
as
hard
as
I
do
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
forward
and
stretched
out
his
arm
again
.
Bathsheba
had
*NL*
overtaken
him
at
a
point
beside
which
stood
a
low
stunted
holly
bush
,
*NL*
now
laden
with
red
berries
.
Seeing
his
advance
take
the
form
of
an
*NL*
attitude
threatening
a
possible
enclosure
,
if
not
compression
,
of
her
*NL*
person
,
she
edged
off
round
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Farmer
Oak
,
''
she
said
,
over
the
top
,
looking
at
him
with
*NL*
rounded
eyes
,
``
I
never
said
I
was
going
to
marry
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
that
IS
a
tale
!
''
said
Oak
,
with
dismay
.
``
To
run
after
anybody
*NL*
like
this
,
and
then
say
you
do
n't
want
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
meant
to
tell
you
was
only
this
,
''
she
said
eagerly
,
and
yet
*NL*
half
conscious
of
the
absurdity
of
the
position
she
had
made
for
*NL*
herself
--
``
that
nobody
has
got
me
yet
as
a
sweetheart
,
instead
of
my
*NL*
having
a
dozen
,
as
my
aunt
said
;
I
HATE
to
be
thought
men
's
property
*NL*
in
that
way
,
though
possibly
I
shall
be
had
some
day
.
Why
,
if
I
'd
*NL*
wanted
you
I
should
n't
have
run
after
you
like
this
;
`
twould
have
*NL*
been
the
FORWARDEST
thing
!
But
there
was
no
harm
in
hurrying
to
*NL*
correct
a
piece
of
false
news
that
had
been
told
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
no
--
no
harm
at
all
.
''
But
there
is
such
a
thing
as
being
too
*NL*
generous
in
expressing
a
judgment
impulsively
,
and
Oak
added
with
a
*NL*
more
appreciative
sense
of
all
the
circumstances
--
``
Well
,
I
am
not
*NL*
quite
certain
it
was
no
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
had
n't
time
to
think
before
starting
whether
I
wanted
to
*NL*
marry
or
not
,
for
you
'd
have
been
gone
over
the
hill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
freshening
again
;
``
think
a
minute
or
two
.
I
'll
*NL*
wait
a
while
,
Miss
Everdene
.
Will
you
marry
me
?
Do
,
Bathsheba
.
I
*NL*
love
you
far
more
than
common
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
to
think
,
''
she
observed
,
rather
more
timorously
;
``
if
I
can
*NL*
think
out
of
doors
;
my
mind
spreads
away
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
can
give
a
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
give
me
time
.
''
Bathsheba
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
*NL*
distance
,
away
from
the
direction
in
which
Gabriel
stood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
make
you
happy
,
''
said
he
to
the
back
of
her
head
,
across
the
*NL*
bush
.
``
You
shall
have
a
piano
in
a
year
or
two
--
farmers
'
wives
are
*NL*
getting
to
have
pianos
now
--
and
I
'll
practise
up
the
flute
right
well
*NL*
to
play
with
you
in
the
evenings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
should
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
one
of
those
little
ten-pound
gigs
for
market
--
and
nice
*NL*
flowers
,
and
birds
--
cocks
and
hens
I
mean
,
because
they
be
useful
,
''
*NL*
continued
Gabriel
,
feeling
balanced
between
poetry
and
practicality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
it
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
frame
for
cucumbers
--
like
a
gentleman
and
lady
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
the
wedding
was
over
,
we
'd
have
it
put
in
the
newspaper
*NL*
list
of
marriages
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearly
I
should
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
the
babies
in
the
births

every
man
jack
of
'em

And
at
home
by
*NL*
the
fire
,
whenever
you
look
up

there
I
shall
be

and
whenever
I
look
*NL*
up
there
will
be
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

wait
,
and
do
n't
be
improper
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
countenance
fell
,
and
she
was
silent
awhile
.
He
regarded
the
red
*NL*
berries
between
them
over
and
over
again
,
to
such
an
extent
,
that
*NL*
holly
seemed
in
his
after
life
to
be
a
cypher
signifying
a
proposal
*NL*
of
marriage
.
Bathsheba
decisively
turned
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
't
is
no
use

she
said
.
``
I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
Try

*NL*
*NL*

I

tried
hard
all
the
time
I
've
been
thinking

for
a
marriage

would
be
very
nice
in
one
sense
.
People
would
talk
about
me
,
and
*NL*
think
I
had
won
my
battle
,
and
I
should
feel
triumphant
,
and
all
*NL*
that
,
But
a
husband
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

he

always
be
there

as
you

whenever

looked
up

be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

what

that

mind
being
a
bride
at
a

wedding

I
could
be
one
without
having
a
husband

But
since
a
*NL*
woman
ca
n't
show
off
in
that
way
by
herself
,
I
sha
n't
marry
--
at

*NL*
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
terrible
wooden
story
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
criticism
of
her
statement
Bathsheba
made
an
addition
to
her
*NL*
dignity
by
a
slight
sweep
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
heart
and
soul

I
do
n't
know
what
a
maid
can
say
stupider

said
Oak
.
``
But
dearest
,
''
he
continued
in
a
palliative
*NL*
voice
,
``
do
n't
be
like
it
!
''
Oak
sighed
a
deep
honest
sigh
--
none
the
*NL*
less
so
in
that
,
being
like
the
sigh
of
a
pine
plantation
,
it
was
*NL*
rather
noticeable
as
a
disturbance
of
the
atmosphere
.
``
Why
wo
n't
you
*NL*
have
me
?
''
he
appealed
,
creeping
round
the
holly
to
reach
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
,
''
she
said
,
retreating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
?
''
he
persisted
,
standing
still
at
last
in
despair
of
ever
*NL*
reaching
her
,
and
facing
over
the
bush
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
contracted
a
yawn
to
an
inoffensive
smallness
,
so
that
it
was
*NL*
hardly
ill-mannered
at
all
.
``
I
do
n't
love
you
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
love
you
--
and
,
as
for
myself

I
am
content
to
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
Mr.
Oak
--
that
's
very
fine
!
You
'd
get
to
despise
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
''
said
Mr
Oak
,
so
earnestly
that
he
seemed
to
be
coming
,
by
*NL*
the
force
of
his
words
,
straight
through
the
bush
and
into
her
arms
.
*NL*
``
I
shall
do
one
thing
in
this
life

one
thing
certain

long
for
you

and
KEEP
WANTING
YOU
till
I
die

''
His
voice
*NL*
had
a
genuine
pathos
now
,
and
his
large
brown
hands
perceptibly
*NL*
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
dreadfully
wrong
not
to
have
you
when
you
feel
so
much
!
''
*NL*
she
said
with
a
little
distress
,
and
looking
hopelessly
around
*NL*
for
some
means
of
escape
from
her
moral
dilemma
.
``
How
I
wish
I
*NL*
had
n't
run
after
you
!
''
However
she
seemed
to
have
a
short
cut
for
*NL*
getting
back
to
cheerfulness
,
and
set
her
face
to
signify
archness
.
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
do

Mr
Oak

I
want
somebody
to
tame
me

I
am
too
*NL*
independent
;
and
you
would
never
be
able
to

I
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
cast
his
eyes
down
the
field
in
a
way
implying
that
it
was
*NL*
useless
to
attempt
argument
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Oak

she
said
,
with
luminous
distinctness
and
common
sense
,
*NL*
``
you
are
better
off
than
I.
I
have
hardly
a
penny
in
the
world
--
I
am
*NL*
staying
with
my
aunt
for
my
bare
sustenance
.
I
am
better
educated
*NL*
than
you
--
and
I
do
n't
love
you
a
bit
:
that
's
my
side
of
the
case
.
*NL*
Now
yours
:
you
are
a
farmer
just
beginning

and
you
ought
in
common
*NL*
prudence

if
you
marry
at
all

you
should
certainly
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
looked
at
her
with
a
little
surprise
and
much
admiration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
very
thing
I
had
been
thinking
myself
!
''
he
naively
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farmer
Oak
had
one-and-a-half
Christian
characteristics
too
many
to
*NL*
succeed
with
Bathsheba
:
his
humility
,
and
a
superfluous
moiety
of
*NL*
honesty
.
Bathsheba
was
decidedly
disconcerted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
why
did
you
come
and
disturb
me
?
''
she
said
,
almost
*NL*
angrily
,
if
not
quite
,
an
enlarging
red
spot
rising
in
each
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
do
what
I
think
would
be

*NL*
*NL*
``
Right

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

wise

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
made
an
admission
NOW
,
Mr.
Oak
,
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
even
*NL*
more
hauteur
,
and
rocking
her
head
disdainfully
.
``
After
that
,
do
you
*NL*
think
I
could
marry
you
?
Not
if
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
broke
in
passionately
.
``
But
do
n't
mistake
me
like
that
!
Because
*NL*
I
am
open
enough
to
own
what
every
man

my
shoes
would
have
thought
*NL*
of
,
you

your
colours
come
up

and
get
crabbed
with
me

*NL*
That
about
your
not
being
good
enough
for
me
is
nonsense
.
You
speak
*NL*
like
a
lady

your
uncle
at
Weatherbury

is

a
large

much
larger
than
ever

May
I
call
in
the
evening

will
you
walk
along
with
me

she
said
,
with
a
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
No

likes
to
see
his
emotions
the
sport
of
a
merry-go-round
of

skittishness

``
Very

said
Oak
,
firmly
,
with
the
bearing
of
one

who
was
going
to
give

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEPARTURE
OF
BATHSHEBA
--
A
PASTORAL
TRAGEDY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
which
one
day
reached
Gabriel
,
that
Bathsheba
Everdene
*NL*
had
left
the
neighbourhood
,
had
an
influence
upon
him
which
might
*NL*
have
surprised
any
who
never
suspected
that
the
more
emphatic
the
*NL*
renunciation
the
less
absolute
its
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
have
been
observed
that
there
is
no
regular
path
for
getting
*NL*
out
of
love
as
there
is
for
getting
in
.
Some
people
look
upon
*NL*
marriage
as
a
short
cut
that
way
,
but
it
has
been
known
to
fail
.
*NL*
Separation
,
which
was
the
means
that
chance
offered
to
Gabriel
Oak
by
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
disappearance
,
though
effectual
with
people
of
certain
*NL*
humours
,
is
apt
to
idealize
the
removed
object
with
others
--
notably
*NL*
those
whose
affection
,
placid
and
regular
as
it
may
be
,
flows
deep
*NL*
and
long
.
Oak
belonged
to
the
even-tempered
order
of
humanity
,
and
*NL*
felt
the
secret
fusion
of
himself
in
Bathsheba
to
be
burning
with
a
*NL*
finer
flame
now
that
she
was
gone
--
that
was
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
incipient
friendship
with
her
aunt
had
been
nipped
by
the
*NL*
failure
of
his
suit
,
and
all
that
Oak
learnt
of
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
movements
was
done
indirectly
.
It
appeared
that
she
had
gone
to
*NL*
a
place
called
Weatherbury
,
more
than
twenty
miles
off
,
but
in
*NL*
what
capacity
--
whether
as
a
visitor
,
or
permanently
,
he
could
not
*NL*
discover
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
had
two
dogs
.
George
,
the
elder
,
exhibited
an
ebony-tipped
*NL*
nose
,
surrounded
by
a
narrow
margin
of
pink
flesh
,
and
a
coat
marked
*NL*
in
random
splotches
approximating
in
colour
to
white
and
slaty
*NL*
grey
;
but
the
grey
,
after
years
of
sun
and
rain
,
had
been
scorched
*NL*
and
washed
out
of
the
more
prominent
locks
,
leaving
them
of
a
*NL*
reddish-brown
,
as
if
the
blue
component
of
the
grey
had
faded
,
like
*NL*
the
indigo
from
the
same
kind
of
colour
in
Turner
's
pictures
.
In
*NL*
substance
it
had
originally
been
hair
,
but
long
contact
with
sheep
*NL*
seemed
to
be
turning
it
by
degrees
into
wool
of
a
poor
quality
and
*NL*
staple
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dog
had
originally
belonged
to
a
shepherd
of
inferior
morals
*NL*
and
dreadful
temper
,
and
the
result
was
that
George
knew
the
exact
*NL*
degrees
of
condemnation
signified
by
cursing
and
swearing
of
all
*NL*
descriptions
better
than
the
wickedest
old
man
in
the
neighbourhood
.
*NL*
Long
experience
had
so
precisely
taught
the
animal
the
difference
*NL*
between
such
exclamations
as
``
Come
in
!
''
and
``
D
--
ye
,
come
in
!
''
that
*NL*
he
knew
to
a
hair
's
breadth
the
rate
of
trotting
back
from
the
ewes
'
*NL*
tails
that
each
call
involved
,
if
a
staggerer
with
the
sheep
crook
*NL*
was
to
be
escaped
.
Though
old
,
he
was
clever
and
trustworthy
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
dog
,
George
's
son
,
might
possibly
have
been
the
image
*NL*
of
his
mother
,
for
there
was
not
much
resemblance
between
him
and
*NL*
George
.
He
was
learning
the
sheep-keeping
business
,
so
as
to
follow
*NL*
on
at
the
flock
when
the
other
should
die
,
but
had
got
no
further
*NL*
than
the
rudiments
as
yet
--
still
finding
an
insuperable
difficulty
*NL*
in
distinguishing
between
doing
a
thing
well
enough
and
doing
it
too
*NL*
well
.
So
earnest
and
yet
so
wrong-headed
was
this
young
dog
-LRB-
he
had
*NL*
no
name
in
particular
,
and
answered
with
perfect
readiness
to
any
*NL*
pleasant
interjection
-RRB-
,
that
if
sent
behind
the
flock
to
help
them
*NL*
on
,
he
did
it
so
thoroughly
that
he
would
have
chased
them
across
the
*NL*
whole
county
with
the
greatest
pleasure
if
not
called
off
or
reminded
*NL*
when
to
stop
by
the
example
of
old
George
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
much
for
the
dogs
.
On
the
further
side
of
Norcombe
Hill
was
*NL*
a
chalk-pit
,
from
which
chalk
had
been
drawn
for
generations
,
and
*NL*
spread
over
adjacent
farms
.
Two
hedges
converged
upon
it
in
the
form
*NL*
of
a
V
,
but
without
quite
meeting
.
The
narrow
opening
left
,
which
*NL*
was
immediately
over
the
brow
of
the
pit
,
was
protected
by
a
rough
*NL*
railing
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
when
Farmer
Oak
had
returned
to
his
house
,
believing
there
*NL*
would
be
no
further
necessity
for
his
attendance
on
the
down
,
he
*NL*
called
as
usual
to
the
dogs
,
previously
to
shutting
them
up
in
the
*NL*
outhouse
till
next
morning
.
Only
one
responded
--
old
George
;
the
*NL*
other
could
not
be
found
,
either
in
the
house
,
lane
,
or
garden
.
*NL*
Gabriel
then
remembered
that
he
had
left
the
two
dogs
on
the
hill
*NL*
eating
a
dead
lamb
-LRB-
a
kind
of
meat
he
usually
kept
from
them
,
except
*NL*
when
other
food
ran
short
-RRB-
,
and
concluding
that
the
young
one
had
*NL*
not
finished
his
meal
,
he
went
indoors
to
the
luxury
of
a
bed
,
which
*NL*
latterly
he
had
only
enjoyed
on
Sundays
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
still
,
moist
night
.
Just
before
dawn
he
was
assisted
in
*NL*
waking
by
the
abnormal
reverberation
of
familiar
music
.
To
the
*NL*
shepherd
,
the
note
of
the
sheep-bell
,
like
the
ticking
of
the
clock
*NL*
to
other
people
,
is
a
chronic
sound
that
only
makes
itself
noticed
by
*NL*
ceasing
or
altering
in
some
unusual
manner
from
the
well-known
idle
*NL*
twinkle
which
signifies
to
the
accustomed
ear
,
however
distant
,
that
*NL*
all
is
well
in
the
fold
.
In
the
solemn
calm
of
the
awakening
morn
*NL*
that
note
was
heard
by
Gabriel
,
beating
with
unusual
violence
and
*NL*
rapidity
.
This
exceptional
ringing
may
be
caused
in
two
ways
--
by
*NL*
the
rapid
feeding
of
the
sheep
bearing
the
bell
,
as
when
the
flock
*NL*
breaks
into
new
pasture
,
which
gives
it
an
intermittent
rapidity
,
*NL*
or
by
the
sheep
starting
off
in
a
run
,
when
the
sound
has
a
regular
*NL*
palpitation
.
The
experienced
ear
of
Oak
knew
the
sound
he
now
heard
*NL*
to
be
caused
by
the
running
of
the
flock
with
great
velocity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
jumped
out
of
bed
,
dressed
,
tore
down
the
lane
through
a
foggy
*NL*
dawn
,
and
ascended
the
hill
.
The
forward
ewes
were
kept
apart
from
*NL*
those
among
which
the
fall
of
lambs
would
be
later
,
there
being
two
*NL*
hundred
of
the
latter
class
in
Gabriel
's
flock
.
These
two
hundred
*NL*
seemed
to
have
absolutely
vanished
from
the
hill
.
There
were
the
*NL*
fifty
with
their
lambs
,
enclosed
at
the
other
end
as
he
had
left
*NL*
them
,
but
the
rest
,
forming
the
bulk
of
the
flock
,
were
nowhere
.
*NL*
Gabriel
called
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
shepherd
's
call
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ovey
,
ovey
,
ovey
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
single
bleat
.
He
went
to
the
hedge
;
a
gap
had
been
broken
*NL*
through
it
,
and
in
the
gap
were
the
footprints
of
the
sheep
.
Rather
*NL*
surprised
to
find
them
break
fence
at
this
season
,
yet
putting
it
*NL*
down
instantly
to
their
great
fondness
for
ivy
in
winter-time
,
of
*NL*
which
a
great
deal
grew
in
the
plantation
,
he
followed
through
the
*NL*
hedge
.
They
were
not
in
the
plantation
.
He
called
again
:
the
*NL*
valleys
and
farthest
hills
resounded
as
when
the
sailors
invoked
the
*NL*
lost
Hylas
on
the
Mysian
shore
;
but
no
sheep
.
He
passed
through
the
*NL*
trees
and
along
the
ridge
of
the
hill
.
On
the
extreme
summit
,
where
*NL*
the
ends
of
the
two
converging
hedges
of
which
we
have
spoken
were
*NL*
stopped
short
by
meeting
the
brow
of
the
chalk-pit
,
he
saw
the
*NL*
younger
dog
standing
against
the
sky
--
dark
and
motionless
as
Napoleon
*NL*
at
St.
Helena
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
horrible
conviction
darted
through
Oak
.
With
a
sensation
of
bodily
*NL*
faintness
he
advanced
:
at
one
point
the
rails
were
broken
through
,
*NL*
and
there
he
saw
the
footprints
of
his
ewes
.
The
dog
came
up
,
licked
*NL*
his
hand
,
and
made
signs
implying
that
he
expected
some
great
reward
*NL*
for
signal
services
rendered
.
Oak
looked
over
the
precipice
.
The
*NL*
ewes
lay
dead
and
dying
at
its
foot
--
a
heap
of
two
hundred
mangled
*NL*
carcasses
,
representing
in
their
condition
just
now
at
least
two
*NL*
hundred
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
was
an
intensely
humane
man
:
indeed
,
his
humanity
often
tore
in
*NL*
pieces
any
politic
intentions
of
his
which
bordered
on
strategy
,
and
*NL*
carried
him
on
as
by
gravitation
.
A
shadow
in
his
life
had
always
*NL*
been
that
his
flock
ended
in
mutton
--
that
a
day
came
and
found
every
*NL*
shepherd
an
arrant
traitor
to
his
defenseless
sheep
.
His
first
*NL*
feeling
now
was
one
of
pity
for
the
untimely
fate
of
these
gentle
*NL*
ewes
and
their
unborn
lambs
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
second
to
remember
another
phase
of
the
matter
.
The
*NL*
sheep
were
not
insured
.
All
the
savings
of
a
frugal
life
had
been
*NL*
dispersed
at
a
blow
;
his
hopes
of
being
an
independent
farmer
were
*NL*
laid
low
--
possibly
for
ever
.
Gabriel
's
energies
,
patience
,
and
*NL*
industry
had
been
so
severely
taxed
during
the
years
of
his
life
*NL*
between
eighteen
and
eight-and-twenty
,
to
reach
his
present
stage
of
*NL*
progress
that
no
more
seemed
to
be
left
in
him
.
He
leant
down
upon
a
*NL*
rail
,
and
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stupors
,
however
,
do
not
last
for
ever
,
and
Farmer
Oak
recovered
from
*NL*
his
.
It
was
as
remarkable
as
it
was
characteristic
that
the
one
*NL*
sentence
he
uttered
was
in
thankfulness
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
I
am
not
married
:
what
would
SHE
have
done
in
the
poverty
*NL*
now
coming
upon
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
raised
his
head
,
and
wondering
what
he
could
do
,
listlessly
*NL*
surveyed
the
scene
.
By
the
outer
margin
of
the
Pit
was
an
oval
pond
,
*NL*
and
over
it
hung
the
attenuated
skeleton
of
a
chrome-yellow
moon
*NL*
which
had
only
a
few
days
to
last
--
the
morning
star
dogging
her
on
*NL*
the
left
hand
.
The
pool
glittered
like
a
dead
man
's
eye
,
and
as
the
*NL*
world
awoke
a
breeze
blew
,
shaking
and
elongating
the
reflection
of
*NL*
the
moon
without
breaking
it
,
and
turning
the
image
of
the
star
to
a
*NL*
phosphoric
streak
upon
the
water
.
All
this
Oak
saw
and
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
far
as
could
be
learnt
it
appeared
that
the
poor
young
dog
,
still
*NL*
under
the
impression
that
since
he
was
kept
for
running
after
sheep
,
*NL*
the
more
he
ran
after
them
the
better
,
had
at
the
end
of
his
meal
*NL*
off
the
dead
lamb
,
which
may
have
given
him
additional
energy
and
*NL*
spirits
,
collected
all
the
ewes
into
a
corner
,
driven
the
timid
*NL*
creatures
through
the
hedge
,
across
the
upper
field
,
and
by
main
*NL*
force
of
worrying
had
given
them
momentum
enough
to
break
down
a
*NL*
portion
of
the
rotten
railing
,
and
so
hurled
them
over
the
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
George
's
son
had
done
his
work
so
thoroughly
that
he
was
considered
*NL*
too
good
a
workman
to
live
,
and
was
,
in
fact
,
taken
and
tragically
*NL*
shot
at
twelve
o'clock
that
same
day
--
another
instance
of
the
*NL*
untoward
fate
which
so
often
attends
dogs
and
other
philosophers
*NL*
who
follow
out
a
train
of
reasoning
to
its
logical
conclusion
,
and
*NL*
attempt
perfectly
consistent
conduct
in
a
world
made
up
so
largely
*NL*
of
compromise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
's
farm
had
been
stocked
by
a
dealer
--
on
the
strength
of
Oak
's
*NL*
promising
look
and
character
--
who
was
receiving
a
percentage
from
the
*NL*
farmer
till
such
time
as
the
advance
should
be
cleared
off
.
Oak
found
*NL*
that
the
value
of
stock
,
plant
,
and
implements
which
were
really
his
*NL*
own
would
be
about
sufficient
to
pay
his
debts
,
leaving
himself
a
*NL*
free
man
with
the
clothes
he
stood
up
in
,
and
nothing
more
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
FAIR
--
THE
JOURNEY
--
THE
FIRE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Two
months
passed
away
.
We
are
brought
on
to
a
day
in
February
,
on
*NL*
which
was
held
the
yearly
statute
or
hiring
fair
in
the
county-town
*NL*
of
Casterbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
one
end
of
the
street
stood
from
two
to
three
hundred
blithe
and
*NL*
hearty
labourers
waiting
upon
Chance
--
all
men
of
the
stamp
to
whom
*NL*
labour
suggests
nothing
worse
than
a
wrestle
with
gravitation
,
and
*NL*
pleasure
nothing
better
than
a
renunciation
of
the
same
.
Among
*NL*
these
,
carters
and
waggoners
were
distinguished
by
having
a
piece
*NL*
of
whip-cord
twisted
round
their
hats
;
thatchers
wore
a
fragment
of
*NL*
woven
straw
;
shepherds
held
their
sheep-crooks
in
their
hands
;
and
*NL*
thus
the
situation
required
was
known
to
the
hirers
at
a
glance
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
crowd
was
an
athletic
young
fellow
of
somewhat
superior
*NL*
appearance
to
the
rest
--
in
fact
,
his
superiority
was
marked
enough
to
*NL*
lead
several
ruddy
peasants
standing
by
to
speak
to
him
inquiringly
,
*NL*
as
to
a
farmer
,
and
to
use
``
Sir
''
as
a
finishing
word
.
His
answer
*NL*
always
was
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
looking
for
a
place
myself
--
a
bailiff
's
.
Do
ye
know
of
anybody
*NL*
who
wants
one
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
was
paler
now
.
His
eyes
were
more
meditative
,
and
his
*NL*
expression
was
more
sad
.
He
had
passed
through
an
ordeal
of
*NL*
wretchedness
which
had
given
him
more
than
it
had
taken
away
.
He
*NL*
had
sunk
from
his
modest
elevation
as
pastoral
king
into
the
very
*NL*
slime-pits
of
Siddim
;
but
there
was
left
to
him
a
dignified
calm
he
*NL*
had
never
before
known
,
and
that
indifference
to
fate
which
,
though
*NL*
it
often
makes
a
villain
of
a
man
,
is
the
basis
of
his
sublimity
when
*NL*
it
does
not
.
And
thus
the
abasement
had
been
exaltation
,
and
the
*NL*
loss
gain
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
morning
a
regiment
of
cavalry
had
left
the
town
,
and
a
*NL*
sergeant
and
his
party
had
been
beating
up
for
recruits
through
the
*NL*
four
streets
.
As
the
end
of
the
day
drew
on
,
and
he
found
himself
*NL*
not
hired
,
Gabriel
almost
wished
that
he
had
joined
them
,
and
gone
*NL*
off
to
serve
his
country
.
Weary
of
standing
in
the
market-place
,
and
*NL*
not
much
minding
the
kind
of
work
he
turned
his
hand
to
,
he
decided
*NL*
to
offer
himself
in
some
other
capacity
than
that
of
bailiff
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
farmers
seemed
to
be
wanting
shepherds
.
Sheep-tending
was
*NL*
Gabriel
's
speciality
.
Turning
down
an
obscure
street
and
entering
*NL*
an
obscurer
lane
,
he
went
up
to
a
smith
's
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
would
it
take
you
to
make
a
shepherd
's
crook
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
shillings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
on
a
bench
and
the
crook
was
made
,
a
stem
being
given
him
into
*NL*
the
bargain
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
then
went
to
a
ready-made
clothes
'
shop
,
the
owner
of
which
had
a
*NL*
large
rural
connection
.
As
the
crook
had
absorbed
most
of
Gabriel
's
*NL*
money
,
he
attempted
,
and
carried
out
,
an
exchange
of
his
overcoat
for
*NL*
a
shepherd
's
regulation
smock-frock
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
transaction
having
been
completed
,
he
again
hurried
off
to
the
*NL*
centre
of
the
town
,
and
stood
on
the
kerb
of
the
pavement
,
as
a
*NL*
shepherd
,
crook
in
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
that
Oak
had
turned
himself
into
a
shepherd
,
it
seemed
that
*NL*
bailiffs
were
most
in
demand
.
However
,
two
or
three
farmers
noticed
*NL*
him
and
drew
near
.
Dialogues
followed
,
more
or
less
in
the
subjoined
*NL*
form
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
do
you
come
from
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Norcombe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
long
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifteen
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
farm
were
you
upon
last
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
reply
invariably
operated
like
a
rumour
of
cholera
.
The
*NL*
inquiring
farmer
would
edge
away
and
shake
his
head
dubiously
.
*NL*
Gabriel
,
like
his
dog
,
was
too
good
to
be
trustworthy
,
and
he
never
*NL*
made
advance
beyond
this
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
safer
to
accept
any
chance
that
offers
itself
,
and
extemporize
*NL*
a
procedure
to
fit
it
,
than
to
get
a
good
plan
matured
,
and
wait
for
*NL*
a
chance
of
using
it
.
Gabriel
wished
he
had
not
nailed
up
his
*NL*
colours
as
a
shepherd
,
but
had
laid
himself
out
for
anything
in
the
*NL*
whole
cycle
of
labour
that
was
required
in
the
fair
.
It
grew
dusk
.
*NL*
Some
merry
men
were
whistling
and
singing
by
the
corn-exchange
.
*NL*
Gabriel
's
hand
,
which
had
lain
for
some
time
idle
in
his
smock-frock
*NL*
pocket
,
touched
his
flute
which
he
carried
there
.
Here
was
an
*NL*
opportunity
for
putting
his
dearly
bought
wisdom
into
practice
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
out
his
flute
and
began
to
play
``
Jockey
to
the
Fair
''
in
the
*NL*
style
of
a
man
who
had
never
known
moment
's
sorrow
.
Oak
could
pipe
*NL*
with
Arcadian
sweetness
,
and
the
sound
of
the
well-known
notes
*NL*
cheered
his
own
heart
as
well
as
those
of
the
loungers
.
He
played
on
*NL*
with
spirit
,
and
in
half
an
hour
had
earned
in
pence
what
was
a
small
*NL*
fortune
to
a
destitute
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
making
inquiries
he
learnt
that
there
was
another
fair
at
*NL*
Shottsford
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
far
is
Shottsford
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ten
miles
t
`
other
side
of
Weatherbury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Weatherbury
!
It
was
where
Bathsheba
had
gone
two
months
before
.
*NL*
This
information
was
like
coming
from
night
into
noon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
far
is
it
to
Weatherbury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five
or
six
miles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
had
probably
left
Weatherbury
long
before
this
time
,
but
*NL*
the
place
had
enough
interest
attaching
to
it
to
lead
Oak
to
choose
*NL*
Shottsford
fair
as
his
next
field
of
inquiry
,
because
it
lay
in
the
*NL*
Weatherbury
quarter
.
Moreover
,
the
Weatherbury
folk
were
by
no
means
*NL*
uninteresting
intrinsically
.
If
report
spoke
truly
they
were
as
*NL*
hardy
,
merry
,
thriving
,
wicked
a
set
as
any
in
the
whole
county
.
Oak
*NL*
resolved
to
sleep
at
Weatherbury
that
night
on
his
way
to
Shottsford
,
*NL*
and
struck
out
at
once
into
the
high
road
which
had
been
recommended
*NL*
as
the
direct
route
to
the
village
in
question
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
road
stretched
through
water-meadows
traversed
by
little
brooks
,
*NL*
whose
quivering
surfaces
were
braided
along
their
centres
,
and
*NL*
folded
into
creases
at
the
sides
;
or
,
where
the
flow
was
more
*NL*
rapid
,
the
stream
was
pied
with
spots
of
white
froth
,
which
rode
*NL*
on
in
undisturbed
serenity
.
On
the
higher
levels
the
dead
and
*NL*
dry
carcasses
of
leaves
tapped
the
ground
as
they
bowled
along
*NL*
helter-skelter
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
wind
,
and
little
birds
in
*NL*
the
hedges
were
rustling
their
feathers
and
tucking
themselves
in
*NL*
comfortably
for
the
night
,
retaining
their
places
if
Oak
kept
moving
,
*NL*
but
flying
away
if
he
stopped
to
look
at
them
.
He
passed
by
Yalbury
*NL*
Wood
where
the
game-birds
were
rising
to
their
roosts
,
and
heard
the
*NL*
crack-voiced
cock-pheasants
``
cu-uck
,
cuck
,
''
and
the
wheezy
whistle
of
*NL*
the
hens
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
he
had
walked
three
or
four
miles
every
shape
in
the
*NL*
landscape
had
assumed
a
uniform
hue
of
blackness
.
He
descended
*NL*
Yalbury
Hill
and
could
just
discern
ahead
of
him
a
waggon
,
drawn
up
*NL*
under
a
great
over-hanging
tree
by
the
roadside
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
coming
close
,
he
found
there
were
no
horses
attached
to
it
,
the
*NL*
spot
being
apparently
quite
deserted
.
The
waggon
,
from
its
position
,
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
left
there
for
the
night
,
for
beyond
about
half
*NL*
a
truss
of
hay
which
was
heaped
in
the
bottom
,
it
was
quite
empty
.
*NL*
Gabriel
sat
down
on
the
shafts
of
the
vehicle
and
considered
his
*NL*
position
.
He
calculated
that
he
had
walked
a
very
fair
proportion
of
*NL*
the
journey
;
and
having
been
on
foot
since
daybreak
,
he
felt
tempted
*NL*
to
lie
down
upon
the
hay
in
the
waggon
instead
of
pushing
on
to
the
*NL*
village
of
Weatherbury
,
and
having
to
pay
for
a
lodging
.
*NL*
*NL*
Eating
his
last
slices
of
bread
and
ham
,
and
drinking
from
the
bottle
*NL*
of
cider
he
had
taken
the
precaution
to
bring
with
him
,
he
got
into
*NL*
the
lonely
waggon
.
Here
he
spread
half
of
the
hay
as
a
bed
,
and
,
*NL*
as
well
as
he
could
in
the
darkness
,
pulled
the
other
half
over
*NL*
him
by
way
of
bed-clothes
,
covering
himself
entirely
,
and
feeling
,
*NL*
physically
,
as
comfortable
as
ever
he
had
been
in
his
life
.
Inward
*NL*
melancholy
it
was
impossible
for
a
man
like
Oak
,
introspective
far
*NL*
beyond
his
neighbours
,
to
banish
quite
,
whilst
conning
the
present
*NL*
untoward
page
of
his
history
.
So
,
thinking
of
his
misfortunes
,
*NL*
amorous
and
pastoral
,
he
fell
asleep
,
shepherds
enjoying
,
in
common
*NL*
with
sailors
,
the
privilege
of
being
able
to
summon
the
god
instead
*NL*
of
having
to
wait
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
somewhat
suddenly
awaking
,
after
a
sleep
of
whose
length
he
had
no
*NL*
idea
,
Oak
found
that
the
waggon
was
in
motion
.
He
was
being
carried
*NL*
along
the
road
at
a
rate
rather
considerable
for
a
vehicle
without
*NL*
springs
,
and
under
circumstances
of
physical
uneasiness
,
his
*NL*
head
being
dandled
up
and
down
on
the
bed
of
the
waggon
like
a
*NL*
kettledrum-stick
.
He
then
distinguished
voices
in
conversation
,
*NL*
coming
from
the
forpart
of
the
waggon
.
His
concern
at
this
dilemma
*NL*
-LRB-
which
would
have
been
alarm
,
had
he
been
a
thriving
man
;
but
*NL*
misfortune
is
a
fine
opiate
to
personal
terror
-RRB-
led
him
to
peer
*NL*
cautiously
from
the
hay
,
and
the
first
sight
he
beheld
was
the
stars
*NL*
above
him
.
Charles
's
Wain
was
getting
towards
a
right
angle
with
*NL*
the
Pole
star
,
and
Gabriel
concluded
that
it
must
be
about
nine
*NL*
o'clock
--
in
other
words
,
that
he
had
slept
two
hours
.
This
small
*NL*
astronomical
calculation
was
made
without
any
positive
effort
,
and
*NL*
whilst
he
was
stealthily
turning
to
discover
,
if
possible
,
into
whose
*NL*
hands
he
had
fallen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
figures
were
dimly
visible
in
front
,
sitting
with
their
legs
*NL*
outside
the
waggon
,
one
of
whom
was
driving
.
Gabriel
soon
found
that
*NL*
this
was
the
waggoner
,
and
it
appeared
they
had
come
from
*NL*
Casterbridge
fair
,
like
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
conversation
was
in
progress
,
which
continued
thus
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
as
`
twill
,
she
's
a
fine
handsome
body
as
far
's
looks
be
*NL*
concerned
.
But
that
's
only
the
skin
of
the
woman
,
and
these
dandy
*NL*
cattle
be
as
proud
as
a
lucifer
in
their
insides
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
--
so
'
a
do
seem
,
Billy
Smallbury
--
so
'
a
do
seem
.
''
This
utterance
*NL*
was
very
shaky
by
nature
,
and
more
so
by
circumstance
,
the
jolting
of
*NL*
the
waggon
not
being
without
its
effect
upon
the
speaker
's
larynx
.
*NL*
It
came
from
the
man
who
held
the
reins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
a
very
vain
feymell
--
so
't
is
said
here
and
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
now
.
If
so
be
't
is
like
that
,
I
ca
n't
look
her
in
the
face
.
*NL*
Lord
,
no
:
not
I
--
heh-heh-heh
!
Such
a
shy
man
as
I
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
she
's
very
vain

'T
is
said
that
every
night
at
going
to
bed
*NL*
she
looks
in
the
glass
to
put
on
her
night-cap
properly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
not
a
married
woman
.
Oh

the
world

*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
these
and
other
similar
remarks
,
a
wild
thought
flashed
*NL*
into
Gabriel
's
mind
that
they
might
be
speaking
of
Bathsheba
.
There
*NL*
were
,
however
,
no
grounds
for
retaining
such
a
supposition
,
for
the
*NL*
waggon
,
though
going
in
the
direction
of
Weatherbury
,
might
be
going
*NL*
beyond
it
,
and
the
woman
alluded
to
seemed
to
be
the
mistress
of
some
*NL*
estate
.
They
were
now
apparently
close
upon
Weatherbury
and
not
to
*NL*
alarm
the
speakers
unnecessarily
,
Gabriel
slipped
out
of
the
waggon
*NL*
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
to
an
opening
in
the
hedge
,
which
he
found
to
be
a
gate
,
*NL*
and
mounting
thereon
,
he
sat
meditating
whether
to
seek
a
cheap
*NL*
lodging
in
the
village
,
or
to
ensure
a
cheaper
one
by
lying
under
*NL*
some
hay
or
corn-stack
.
The
crunching
jangle
of
the
waggon
died
upon
*NL*
his
ear
.
He
was
about
to
walk
on
,
when
he
noticed
on
his
left
hand
*NL*
an
unusual
light
--
appearing
about
half
a
mile
distant
.
Oak
watched
*NL*
it
,
and
the
glow
increased
.
Something
was
on
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
again
mounted
the
gate
,
and
,
leaping
down
on
the
other
side
*NL*
upon
what
he
found
to
be
ploughed
soil
,
made
across
the
field
in
the
*NL*
exact
direction
of
the
fire
.
The
blaze
,
enlarging
in
a
double
ratio
*NL*
by
his
approach
and
its
own
increase
,
showed
him
as
he
drew
nearer
*NL*
the
outlines
of
ricks
beside
it
,
lighted
up
to
great
distinctness
.
A
*NL*
rick-yard
was
the
source
of
the
fire
.
His
weary
face
now
began
to
*NL*
be
painted
over
with
a
rich
orange
glow
,
and
the
whole
front
of
his
*NL*
smock-frock
and
gaiters
was
covered
with
a
dancing
shadow
pattern
of
*NL*
thorn-twigs
--
the
light
reaching
him
through
a
leafless
intervening
*NL*
hedge
--
and
the
metallic
curve
of
his
sheep-crook
shone
silver-bright
*NL*
in
the
same
abounding
rays
.
He
came
up
to
the
boundary
fence
,
and
*NL*
stood
to
regain
breath
.
It
seemed
as
if
the
spot
was
unoccupied
by
*NL*
a
living
soul
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
was
issuing
from
a
long
straw-stack
,
which
was
so
far
gone
*NL*
as
to
preclude
a
possibility
of
saving
it
.
A
rick
burns
differently
*NL*
from
a
house
.
As
the
wind
blows
the
fire
inwards
,
the
portion
in
*NL*
flames
completely
disappears
like
melting
sugar
,
and
the
outline
is
*NL*
lost
to
the
eye
.
However
,
a
hay
or
a
wheat-rick
,
well
put
together
,
*NL*
will
resist
combustion
for
a
length
of
time
,
if
it
begins
on
the
*NL*
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
before
Gabriel
's
eyes
was
a
rick
of
straw
,
loosely
put
together
,
*NL*
and
the
flames
darted
into
it
with
lightning
swiftness
.
It
glowed
on
*NL*
the
windward
side
,
rising
and
falling
in
intensity
,
like
the
coal
of
*NL*
a
cigar
.
Then
a
superincumbent
bundle
rolled
down
,
with
a
whisking
*NL*
noise
;
flames
elongated
,
and
bent
themselves
about
with
a
quiet
*NL*
roar
,
but
no
crackle
.
Banks
of
smoke
went
off
horizontally
at
the
*NL*
back
like
passing
clouds
,
and
behind
these
burned
hidden
pyres
,
*NL*
illuminating
the
semi-transparent
sheet
of
smoke
to
a
lustrous
yellow
*NL*
uniformity
.
Individual
straws
in
the
foreground
were
consumed
in
a
*NL*
creeping
movement
of
ruddy
heat
,
as
if
they
were
knots
of
red
worms
,
*NL*
and
above
shone
imaginary
fiery
faces
,
tongues
hanging
from
lips
,
*NL*
glaring
eyes
,
and
other
impish
forms
,
from
which
at
intervals
sparks
*NL*
flew
in
clusters
like
birds
from
a
nest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
suddenly
ceased
from
being
a
mere
spectator
by
discovering
the
*NL*
case
to
be
more
serious
than
he
had
at
first
imagined
.
A
scroll
*NL*
of
smoke
blew
aside
and
revealed
to
him
a
wheat-rick
in
startling
*NL*
juxtaposition
with
the
decaying
one
,
and
behind
this
a
series
of
*NL*
others
,
composing
the
main
corn
produce
of
the
farm
;
so
that
instead
*NL*
of
the
straw-stack
standing
,
as
he
had
imagined
comparatively
*NL*
isolated
,
there
was
a
regular
connection
between
it
and
the
remaining
*NL*
stacks
of
the
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
leapt
over
the
hedge
,
and
saw
that
he
was
not
alone
.
The
*NL*
first
man
he
came
to
was
running
about
in
a
great
hurry
,
as
if
his
*NL*
thoughts
were
several
yards
in
advance
of
his
body
,
which
they
could
*NL*
never
drag
on
fast
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
man
--
fire
,
fire
!
A
good
master
and
a
bad
servant
is
fire
,
*NL*
fire
!
--
I
mane
a
bad
servant
and
a
good
master
.
Oh
,
Mark
Clark
--
come
!
*NL*
And
you
,
Billy
Smallbury
--
and
you
,
Maryann
Money
--
and
you
,
Jan
*NL*
Coggan
,
and
Matthew
there
!
''
Other
figures
now
appeared
behind
this
*NL*
shouting
man
and
among
the
smoke
,
and
Gabriel
found
that
,
far
from
*NL*
being
alone
he
was
in
a
great
company
--
whose
shadows
danced
merrily
*NL*
up
and
down
,
timed
by
the
jigging
of
the
flames
,
and
not
at
all
by
*NL*
their
owners
'
movements
.
The
assemblage
--
belonging
to
that
class
of
*NL*
society
which
casts
its
thoughts
into
the
form
of
feeling
,
and
its
*NL*
feelings
into
the
form
of
commotion
--
set
to
work
with
a
remarkable
*NL*
confusion
of
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
the
draught
under
the
wheat-rick
!
''
cried
Gabriel
to
those
*NL*
nearest
to
him
.
The
corn
stood
on
stone
staddles
,
and
between
these
,
*NL*
tongues
of
yellow
hue
from
the
burning
straw
licked
and
darted
*NL*
playfully
.
If
the
fire
once
got
UNDER
this
stack
,
all
would
be
lost
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
a
tarpaulin
--
quick
!
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
rick-cloth
was
brought
,
and
they
hung
it
like
a
curtain
across
the
*NL*
channel
.
The
flames
immediately
ceased
to
go
under
the
bottom
of
the
*NL*
corn-stack
,
and
stood
up
vertical
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stand
here
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
keep
the
cloth
wet
.
''
said
*NL*
Gabriel
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
flames
,
now
driven
upwards
,
began
to
attack
the
angles
of
the
*NL*
huge
roof
covering
the
wheat-stack
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
ladder
,
''
cried
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
ladder
was
against
the
straw-rick
and
is
burnt
to
a
cinder
,
''
*NL*
said
a
spectre-like
form
in
the
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
seized
the
cut
ends
of
the
sheaves
,
as
if
he
were
going
to
engage
*NL*
in
the
operation
of
``
reed-drawing
,
''
and
digging
in
his
feet
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
sticking
in
the
stem
of
his
sheep-crook
,
he
clambered
up
*NL*
the
beetling
face
.
He
at
once
sat
astride
the
very
apex
,
and
began
*NL*
with
his
crook
to
beat
off
the
fiery
fragments
which
had
lodged
*NL*
thereon
,
shouting
to
the
others
to
get
him
a
bough
and
a
ladder
,
and
*NL*
some
water
.
*NL*
*NL*
Billy
Smallbury
--
one
of
the
men
who
had
been
on
the
waggon
--
by
this
*NL*
time
had
found
a
ladder
,
which
Mark
Clark
ascended
,
holding
on
beside
*NL*
Oak
upon
the
thatch
.
The
smoke
at
this
corner
was
stifling
,
and
*NL*
Clark
,
a
nimble
fellow
,
having
been
handed
a
bucket
of
water
,
bathed
*NL*
Oak
's
face
and
sprinkled
him
generally
,
whilst
Gabriel
,
now
with
a
*NL*
long
beech-bough
in
one
hand
,
in
addition
to
his
crook
in
the
other
,
*NL*
kept
sweeping
the
stack
and
dislodging
all
fiery
particles
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
ground
the
groups
of
villagers
were
still
occupied
in
doing
*NL*
all
they
could
to
keep
down
the
conflagration
,
which
was
not
much
.
*NL*
They
were
all
tinged
orange
,
and
backed
up
by
shadows
of
varying
*NL*
pattern
.
Round
the
corner
of
the
largest
stack
,
out
of
the
direct
*NL*
rays
of
the
fire
,
stood
a
pony
,
bearing
a
young
woman
on
its
back
.
*NL*
By
her
side
was
another
woman
,
on
foot
.
These
two
seemed
to
keep
at
*NL*
a
distance
from
the
fire
,
that
the
horse
might
not
become
restive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
shepherd
,
''
said
the
woman
on
foot
.
``
Yes
--
he
is
.
See
how
his
*NL*
crook
shines
as
he
beats
the
rick
with
it
.
And
his
smock-frock
is
*NL*
burnt
in
two
holes
,
I
declare
!
A
fine
young
shepherd
he
is
too
,
*NL*
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
shepherd
is
he
?
''
said
the
equestrian
in
a
clear
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know

ma'am

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody

Quite
a
stranger

say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
woman
on
the
pony
rode
out
from
the
shade
and
looked
*NL*
anxiously
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
barn
is
safe
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
D'ye
think
the
barn
is
safe

Jan
Coggan
?
''
said
the
second
woman
,
*NL*
passing
on
the
question
to
the
nearest
man
in
that
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Safe-now
--
leastwise
I
think
so
.
If
this
rick
had
gone
the
barn
*NL*
would
have
followed

'T
is
that
bold
shepherd
up
there
that
have
done
*NL*
the
most
good
--
he
sitting
on
the
top
o

rick
,
whizzing
his
great
*NL*
long-arms
about
like
a
windmill
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
work
hard
,
''
said
the
young
woman
on
horseback
,
looking
up
at
*NL*
Gabriel
through
her
thick
woollen
veil
.
``
I
wish
he
was
shepherd
*NL*
here
.
Do
n't
any
of
you
know

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
heard
the
man

my
life
,
or
seed
his
form
afore

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
began
to
get
worsted
,
and
Gabriel
's
elevated
position
being
*NL*
no
longer
required
of
him
,
he
made
as
if
to
descend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maryann

''
said
the
girl
on
horseback
,
``
go
to
him

comes
down

service
he
*NL*
has
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
Maryann
stalked
off
towards
the
rick
and
met
Oak
at
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
ladder
.
She
delivered
her
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
your
master

farmer
?
''
asked
Gabriel
,
kindling
with
the
*NL*
idea
of
getting
employment
that
seemed
to
strike
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T

``

;

*NL*
*NL*
Oak
,
his
features
smudged
,
grimy
,
and
undiscoverable
from
the
smoke
*NL*
and
heat
,
his
smock-frock
burnt
into
holes
and
dripping
with
water
,
*NL*
the
ash
stem
of
his
sheep-crook
charred
six

shorter

advanced

with
the
humility
stern
adversity
had
thrust
upon
him
up
to
the
*NL*
slight
female
form
in
the
saddle
.
He
lifted
his
hat
with
respect
,
*NL*
and
not
without
gallantry
:
stepping
close
to
her
hanging
feet
he
said
*NL*
in
a
hesitating
voice
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
happen
to

*NL*
*NL*
She
lifted
the
wool
veil
tied
round
her
face
,
and
looked
all
*NL*
astonishment
.
Gabriel
and
his
cold-hearted
darling
,
Bathsheba

Everdene

were
face
to
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
did
not
speak

mechanically
repeated
in

abashed

CHAPTER
VII

*NL*
*NL*
RECOGNITION
--
A
TIMID
GIRL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
withdrew
into
the
shade
.
She
scarcely
knew
whether
most
to
*NL*
be
amused
at
the
singularity
of
the
meeting
,
or
to
be
concerned
at
*NL*
its
awkwardness
.
There
was
room
for
a
little
pity
,
also
for
a
very
*NL*
little
exultation
:
the
former
at
his
position
,
the
latter
at
her
own
.
*NL*
Embarrassed
she
was
not
,
and
she
remembered
Gabriel
's
declaration
of
*NL*
love
to
her
at
Norcombe
only
to
think
she
had
nearly
forgotten
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
murmured
,
putting
on
an
air
of
dignity
,
and
turning
again
*NL*
to
him
with
a
little
warmth
of
cheek
;
``
I
do
want
a
shepherd
.
But
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
the
very
man
,
ma'am
,
''
said
one
of
the
villagers
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Conviction
breeds
conviction
.
``
Ay
,
that
'
a
is
,
''
said
a
second
,
*NL*
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
man
,
truly
!
''
said
a
third
,
with
heartiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
all
there
!
''
said
number
four
,
fervidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
will
you
tell
him
to
speak
to
the
bailiff
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
was
practical
again
now
.
A
summer
eve
and
loneliness
would
have
*NL*
been
necessary
to
give
the
meeting
its
proper
fulness
of
romance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
was
pointed
out
to
Gabriel
,
who
,
checking
the
palpitation
*NL*
within
his
breast
at
discovering
that
this
Ashtoreth
of
strange
*NL*
report
was
only
a
modification
of
Venus
the
well-known
and
admired
,
*NL*
retired
with
him
to
talk
over
the
necessary
preliminaries
of
hiring
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fire
before
them
wasted
away
.
``
Men
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
``
you
shall
*NL*
take
a
little
refreshment
after
this
extra
work
.
Will
you
come
to
*NL*
the
house
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
knock
in
a
bit
and
a
drop
a
good
deal
freer
,
Miss
,
if
so
be
*NL*
ye
'd
send
it
to
Warren
's
Malthouse
,
''
replied
the
spokesman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
then
rode
off
into
the
darkness
,
and
the
men
straggled
on
*NL*
to
the
village
in
twos
and
threes
--
Oak
and
the
bailiff
being
left
by
*NL*
the
rick
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
said
the
bailiff
,
finally
,
``
all
is
settled
,
I
think
,
about
*NL*
your
coming
,
and
I
am
going
home-along
.
Good-night
to
ye
,
shepherd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
get
me
a
lodging
?
''
inquired
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
ca
n't
,
indeed
,
''
he
said
,
moving
past
Oak
as
a
Christian
edges
*NL*
past
an
offertory-plate
when
he
does
not
mean
to
contribute
.
``
If
you
*NL*
follow
on
the
road
till
you
come
to
Warren
's
Malthouse
,
where
they
*NL*
are
all
gone
to
have
their
snap
of
victuals
,
I
daresay
some
of
'em
*NL*
will
tell
you
of
a
place
.
Good-night
to
ye
,
shepherd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
bailiff
who
showed
this
nervous
dread
of
loving
his
neighbour
as
*NL*
himself
,
went
up
the
hill
,
and
Oak
walked
on
to
the
village
,
still
*NL*
astonished
at
the
reencounter
with
Bathsheba
,
glad
of
his
nearness
to
*NL*
her
,
and
perplexed
at
the
rapidity
with
which
the
unpractised
girl
of
*NL*
Norcombe
had
developed
into
the
supervising
and
cool
woman
here
.
But
*NL*
some
women
only
require
an
emergency
to
make
them
fit
for
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Obliged
,
to
some
extent
,
to
forgo
dreaming
in
order
to
find
the
way
,
*NL*
he
reached
the
churchyard
,
and
passed
round
it
under
the
wall
where
*NL*
several
ancient
trees
grew
.
There
was
a
wide
margin
of
grass
along
*NL*
here
,
and
Gabriel
's
footsteps
were
deadened
by
its
softness
,
even
at
*NL*
this
indurating
period
of
the
year
.
When
abreast
of
a
trunk
which
*NL*
appeared
to
be
the
oldest
of
the
old
,
he
became
aware
that
a
figure
*NL*
was
standing
behind
it
.
Gabriel
did
not
pause
in
his
walk
,
and
in
*NL*
another
moment
he
accidentally
kicked
a
loose
stone
.
The
noise
was
*NL*
enough
to
disturb
the
motionless
stranger
,
who
started
and
assumed
*NL*
a
careless
position
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
slim
girl
,
rather
thinly
clad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
to
you
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
heartily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
said
the
girl
to
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
was
unexpectedly
attractive
;
it
was
the
low
and
dulcet
note
*NL*
suggestive
of
romance
;
common
in
descriptions
,
rare
in
experience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
thank
you
to
tell
me
if
I
'm
in
the
way
for
Warren
's
Malthouse
?
''
*NL*
Gabriel
resumed
,
primarily
to
gain
the
information
,
indirectly
to
get
*NL*
more
of
the
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
right
.
It
's
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
.
And
do
you
know
--
''
*NL*
The
girl
hesitated
and
then
went
on
again
.
``
Do
you
know
how
late
*NL*
they
keep
open
the
Buck
's
Head
Inn
?
''
She
seemed
to
be
won
by
*NL*
Gabriel
's
heartiness
,
as
Gabriel
had
been
won
by
her
modulations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
where
the
Buck
's
Head
is
,
or
anything
about
it
.
Do
you
*NL*
think
of
going
there
to-night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
''
The
woman
again
paused
.
There
was
no
necessity
for
any
*NL*
continuance
of
speech
,
and
the
fact
that
she
did
add
more
seemed
to
*NL*
proceed
from
an
unconscious
desire
to
show
unconcern
by
making
a
*NL*
remark
,
which
is
noticeable
in
the
ingenuous
when
they
are
acting
by
*NL*
stealth
.
``
You
are
not
a
Weatherbury
man
?
''
she
said
,
timorously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
.
I
am
the
new
shepherd
--
just
arrived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
shepherd
--
and
you
seem
almost
a
farmer
by
your
ways
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
shepherd
,
''
Gabriel
repeated
,
in
a
dull
cadence
of
finality
.
*NL*
His
thoughts
were
directed
to
the
past
,
his
eyes
to
the
feet
of
the
*NL*
girl
;
and
for
the
first
time
he
saw
lying
there
a
bundle
of
some
*NL*
sort
.
She
may
have
perceived
the
direction
of
his
face
,
for
she
said
*NL*
coaxingly
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
wo
n't
say
anything
in
the
parish
about
having
seen
me
here
,
will
*NL*
you
--
at
least
,
not
for
a
day
or
two
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
if
you
wish
me
not
to
,
''
said
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
indeed
,
''
the
other
replied
.
``
I
am
rather
poor
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
want
people
to
know
anything
about
me
.
''
Then
she
was
silent
*NL*
and
shivered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ought
to
have
a
cloak
on
such
a
cold
night
,
''
Gabriel
observed
.
*NL*
``
I
would
advise
`
ee
to
get
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
!
Would
you
mind
going
on
and
leaving
me
?
I
thank
you
much
for
*NL*
what
you
have
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
on
,
''
he
said
;
adding
hesitatingly
,
--
``
Since
you
are
not
*NL*
very
well
off
,
perhaps
you
would
accept
this
trifle
from
me
.
It
is
*NL*
only
a
shilling
,
but
it
is
all
I
have
to
spare
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
will
take
it
,
''
said
the
stranger
gratefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
extended
her
hand
;
Gabriel
his
.
In
feeling
for
each
other
's
palm
*NL*
in
the
gloom
before
the
money
could
be
passed
,
a
minute
incident
*NL*
occurred
which
told
much
.
Gabriel
's
fingers
alighted
on
the
young
*NL*
woman
's
wrist
.
It
was
beating
with
a
throb
of
tragic
intensity
.
He
*NL*
had
frequently
felt
the
same
quick
,
hard
beat
in
the
femoral
artery
*NL*
of
his
lambs
when
overdriven
.
It
suggested
a
consumption
too
great
*NL*
of
a
vitality
which
,
to
judge
from
her
figure
and
stature
,
was
*NL*
already
too
little
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
Let
your
having
seen
me
be
a
secret
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
I
will
.
Good-night
,
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
girl
remained
motionless
by
the
tree
,
and
Gabriel
descended
*NL*
into
the
village
of
Weatherbury
,
or
Lower
Longpuddle
as
it
was
*NL*
sometimes
called
.
He
fancied
that
he
had
felt
himself
in
the
*NL*
penumbra
of
a
very
deep
sadness
when
touching
that
slight
and
fragile
*NL*
creature
.
But
wisdom
lies
in
moderating
mere
impressions
,
and
*NL*
Gabriel
endeavoured
to
think
little
of
this
.

CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
MALTHOUSE
--
THE
CHAT
--
NEWS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Warren
's
Malthouse
was
enclosed
by
an
old
wall
inwrapped
with
ivy
,
*NL*
and
though
not
much
of
the
exterior
was
visible
at
this
hour
,
the
*NL*
character
and
purposes
of
the
building
were
clearly
enough
shown
by
*NL*
its
outline
upon
the
sky
.
From
the
walls
an
overhanging
thatched
*NL*
roof
sloped
up
to
a
point
in
the
centre
,
upon
which
rose
a
small
*NL*
wooden
lantern
,
fitted
with
louvre-boards
on
all
the
four
sides
,
*NL*
and
from
these
openings
a
mist
was
dimly
perceived
to
be
escaping
*NL*
into
the
night
air
.
There
was
no
window
in
front
;
but
a
square
*NL*
hole
in
the
door
was
glazed
with
a
single
pane
,
through
which
red
,
*NL*
comfortable
rays
now
stretched
out
upon
the
ivied
wall
in
front
.
*NL*
Voices
were
to
be
heard
inside
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
's
hand
skimmed
the
surface
of
the
door
with
fingers
extended
to
*NL*
an
Elymas-the-Sorcerer
pattern
,
till
he
found
a
leathern
strap
,
which
*NL*
he
pulled
.
This
lifted
a
wooden
latch
,
and
the
door
swung
open
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
inside
was
lighted
only
by
the
ruddy
glow
from
the
kiln
*NL*
mouth
,
which
shone
over
the
floor
with
the
streaming
horizontality
*NL*
of
the
setting
sun
,
and
threw
upwards
the
shadows
of
all
facial
*NL*
irregularities
in
those
assembled
around
.
The
stone-flag
floor
was
*NL*
worn
into
a
path
from
the
doorway
to
the
kiln
,
and
into
undulations
*NL*
everywhere
.
A
curved
settle
of
unplaned
oak
stretched
along
one
*NL*
side
,
and
in
a
remote
corner
was
a
small
bed
and
bedstead
,
the
owner
*NL*
and
frequent
occupier
of
which
was
the
maltster
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
aged
man
was
now
sitting
opposite
the
fire
,
his
frosty
white
*NL*
hair
and
beard
overgrowing
his
gnarled
figure
like
the
grey
moss
and
*NL*
lichen
upon
a
leafless
apple-tree
.
He
wore
breeches
and
the
laced-up
*NL*
shoes
called
ankle-jacks
;
he
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
's
nose
was
greeted
by
an
atmosphere
laden
with
the
sweet
*NL*
smell
of
new
malt
.
The
conversation
-LRB-
which
seemed
to
have
been
*NL*
concerning
the
origin
of
the
fire
-RRB-
immediately
ceased
,
and
every
one
*NL*
ocularly
criticised
him
to
the
degree
expressed
by
contracting
the
*NL*
flesh
of
their
foreheads
and
looking
at
him
with
narrowed
eyelids
,
as
*NL*
if
he
had
been
a
light
too
strong
for
their
sight
.
Several
exclaimed
*NL*
meditatively
,
after
this
operation
had
been
completed
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
't
is
the
new
shepherd
,
'
a
b
`
lieve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
we
heard
a
hand
pawing
about
the
door
for
the
bobbin
,
but
*NL*
were
n't
sure
`
twere
not
a
dead
leaf
blowed
across
,
''
said
another
.
*NL*
``
Come
in
,
shepherd
;
sure
ye
be
welcome
,
though
we
do
n't
know
yer
*NL*
name
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
Oak
,
that
's
my
name
,
neighbours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
ancient
maltster
sitting
in
the
midst
turned
at
this
--
his
turning
*NL*
being
as
the
turning
of
a
rusty
crane
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
never
Gable
Oak
's
grandson
over
at
Norcombe
--
never
!
''
he
said
,
*NL*
as
a
formula
expressive
of
surprise
,
which
nobody
was
supposed
for
a
*NL*
moment
to
take
literally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
father
and
my
grandfather
were
old
men
of
the
name
of
Gabriel
,
''
*NL*
said
the
shepherd
,
placidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thought
I
knowed
the
man
's
face
as
I
seed
him
on
the
rick
!
--
thought

I
did
!
And
where

t

shepherd

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
thinking
of
biding
here
,
''
said
Mr.
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knowed
yer
grandfather
for
years
and
years
!
''
continued
the
maltster
,
*NL*
the
words
coming
forth
of
their
own
accord
as
if
the
momentum
*NL*
previously
imparted
had
been
sufficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
and
did
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knowed
yer
grandmother

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

*NL*
*NL*
``
Likewise

Why

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

''
said
his
son
,
a
young
man
about
sixty-five
,
with
a
*NL*
semi-bald
head
and
one
tooth
in
the
left
centre
of
his
upper
jaw
,
*NL*
which
made
much
of
itself
by
standing
prominent
,
like
a
milestone
in
*NL*
a
bank
.
``

was

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

was
Andrew

''
said
Jacob
's
son
Billy
,
a
child
of
forty
,
or
*NL*
thereabouts
,
who
manifested
the
peculiarity
of
possessing
a
cheerful
*NL*
soul
in
a
gloomy
body
,
and
whose
whiskers
were
assuming
a
chinchilla
*NL*
shade
here
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
mind
Andrew

said
Oak
,
``

removing
from

his

bleared

gazing

*NL*
*NL*
Jacob
stooped
to
the
God-forgive-me
,
which
was
a
two-handled
tall
mug
*NL*
standing
in
the
ashes
,
cracked
and
charred
with
heat
:
it
was
rather
*NL*
furred
with
extraneous
matter
about
the
outside
,
especially
in
the
*NL*
crevices
of
the
handles
,
the
innermost
curves
of
which
may
not
have
*NL*
seen
daylight
for
several
years
by
reason
of
this
encrustation
*NL*
thereon
--
formed
of
ashes
accidentally
wetted
with
cider
and
baked
*NL*
hard
;
but
to
the
mind
of
any
sensible
drinker
the
cup
was
no
*NL*
worse
for
that
,
being
incontestably
clean
on
the
inside
and
about
*NL*
the
rim
.
It
may
be
observed
that
such
a
class
of
mug
is
called
a
*NL*
God-forgive-me
in
Weatherbury
and
its
vicinity
for
uncertain
reasons
;
*NL*
probably
because
its
size
makes
any
given
toper
feel
ashamed
of
*NL*
himself
when
he
sees
its
bottom
in
drinking
it
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jacob
,
on
receiving
the
order
to
see
if
the
liquor
was
warm
enough
,
*NL*
placidly
dipped
his
forefinger
into
it
by
way
of
thermometer
,
and
*NL*
having
pronounced
it
nearly
of
the
proper
degree
,
raised
the
cup
and
*NL*
very
civilly
attempted
to
dust
some
of
the
ashes
from
the
bottom
with
*NL*
the
skirt
of
his
smock-frock
,
because
Shepherd
Oak
was
a
stranger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

the

commandingly

*NL*

Taking
the
mug
he
drank
an
inch
or
*NL*
more
from
the
depth
of
its
contents
,
and
duly
passed
it
to
the
*NL*
next

He
always

strenuously

if
any
passing

ventured
to
remark
that
the

he
received

A
meditation
on
the
obvious
inference
was
indulged
in
by
all
,
and
*NL*
during
its
continuance
each
directed
his
vision
into
the
ashpit

glowed
like
a
desert
in

under

vertical
sun

*NL*
shaping
their

long

partly
because

*NL*
from

Gabriel
broke
the

Gabriel

thrilled
gently

thus
slipped
under

Mr.

,
after
absently
*NL*
scrutinising
a
coal
which
had
fallen
among

took
up
the
*NL*
narrative
,
with
a
private
twirl
of
his
eye
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

now

'd
hardly

it

that

alive

a
did
n't
want
to
be
fickle
,
but
he
could
n't
help
*NL*
it
.
The
pore
feller
were
faithful
and
true
enough
to
her
in
his
*NL*
wish
,
but
his
heart
would
rove
,
do
what
he
would
.
He
spoke
to
me
in
*NL*
real
tribulation
about
it
once
.
`
Coggan

'
he
said
,
'
I
could
never
*NL*

for
a

feeling
she
's
ticketed

lawful

I
ca
n't
help
my
wicked
heart
wandering
,

what
I
*NL*
will

But
at
last
I
believe
he
cured
it
by
making
her
take
off
her
*NL*
wedding-ring
and
calling
her
by
her
maiden
name
as
they
sat
together
*NL*
after

was
shut

so

would
get
to
fancy
she
was
only

his
sweetheart

not
married
to
him
at
all

as
soon

he

could
thoroughly
fancy
he
was
doing
wrong

committing
the
seventh

*NL*

me

from

Then
I
*NL*
was
three
year
at
Mellstock

I

been
here
one-and-thirty

*NL*
come
Candlemas

How
much
is
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hundred

seventeen

chuckled
another
old
gentleman
,
given
to
*NL*
mental
arithmetic
and
little
conversation
,
who
had
hitherto
sat
*NL*
unobserved
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
that
's
my
age

said
the
maltster
,
emphatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no

said
Jacob
.

Your

*NL*
*NL*

Gabriel
,
soothingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

attested
Jan
Coggan
,
also
*NL*
soothingly
.
``
We
all

*NL*
*NL*
``
True

ye

said
the
meeting
*NL*
unanimously
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maltster
,
being
now
pacified
,
was
even
generous
enough
to
*NL*
voluntarily
disparage
in
a
slight
degree
the
virtue
of
having
lived
a
*NL*
great
many
years
,
by
mentioning
that
the
cup
they
were
drinking
out
*NL*
of
was
three
years
older
than
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
cup
was
being
examined
,
the
end
of
Gabriel
Oak
's
flute
*NL*
became
visible
over
his
smock-frock
pocket
,
and
Henery
Fray
*NL*
exclaimed
,
``
Surely
,
shepherd
,
I
seed
you
blowing
into
a
great
flute
*NL*
by
now
at
Casterbridge

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did

said
Gabriel
,
blushing
faintly
.
``
I

been
in

trouble

was
driven

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

Mark
Clark

careless-like

your

will
come

But
we
could
thank

ye
for
a
tune

n't
too
tired

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Neither

Coggan
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

that

said
Gabriel
,
pulling
out
his
flute
and
putting
it
*NL*
together
.
``
A

such
as
I

do
ye

*NL*
have

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
then
struck
up
``
Jockey
to
the
Fair
,
''
and
played
that
sparkling
*NL*
melody
three
times
through
,
accenting
the
notes
in
the
third
round
in
*NL*
a
most
artistic
and
lively
manner
by
bending
his
body
in
small
jerks
*NL*
and
tapping
with
his
foot
to
beat
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
can
blow
the
flute
very
well

that

a
can

said
a
young
married
*NL*
man
,
who
having
no
individuality
worth
mentioning
was
known
as
``
Susan
*NL*
Tall
's

''
He
continued
,
``
I
'd
as
lief
as
not
be
able

into

*NL*
*NL*
``

murmured
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
in
a
soft
cadence
.
``
We
ought
*NL*

*NL*
``

dashed
in
Mark
Clark
conclusively
,
*NL*
not
feeling
it
to
be
of
any
consequence
to
his
opinion
that
he
had
*NL*
only
heard
about
a
word

three-quarters
of
what
Joseph
had
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

added
Joseph
,
beginning
to
feel
like
a
man
in
the
Bible
;

thrive
so
in
these
times

may
be

it
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

I
can
mind

said
Henery
Fray
,
*NL*
criticising
Gabriel
with
misty
eyes
as
he
entered
upon
his
second
*NL*
tune
.
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
pity
that
playing
the
flute
should
make
a
man
look
such
a
*NL*
scarecrow

''
observed
Mr.
Mark
Clark
,
with
additional
criticism
of
*NL*
Gabriel
's
countenance
,
the
latter
person
jerking
out
,
with
the
*NL*
ghastly
grimace
required
by
the
instrument
,
the
chorus
of
``

Joseph
to
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

Mr.

*NL*
*NL*
``
For

Joseph

with
winning
sauvity

*NL*
*NL*

the
company

*NL*
*NL*
``

Oak
,
in
the
modest
tone
good
manners
*NL*
demanded
,
thinking
,
however
,
that
he
would
never
let
Bathsheba
see
*NL*
him
playing
the
flute
;
in
this
resolve
showing
a
discretion
equal
to
*NL*
that
related
to
its
sagacious
inventress
,
the
divine
Minerva
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
when
I
and
my

Church

said
the
*NL*
old
maltster
,
not
pleased
at
finding
himself
left
out
of
the
subject
,
*NL*
``
we
were
called

*NL*
*NL*
``
Danged

said
a
voice
with
the
*NL*
vigour
natural
to
the
enunciation
of
a
remarkably
evident
truism
.
*NL*
It
came
from
the
old
man
in
the
background
,
whose
offensiveness
and
*NL*
spiteful
ways
were
barely
atoned
for
by
the
occasional
chuckle
he
*NL*
contributed
to
general
laughs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

said
Susan
Tall

husband
,
the
young

man
who
had
spoken
once
before
.
``
I

*NL*
``

Coggan

The
young

halted
lamely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
New

Susan

in
a
tone
*NL*
intended
to
imply
his
habitual
reception
of
jokes
without
minding
*NL*
them
at
all

The
young
man
then
wished
them
good-night
and
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henery
Fray
was
the
first
to
follow
.
Then
Gabriel
arose
and
went
off
*NL*
with
Jan
Coggan
,
who
had
offered
him
a
lodging
.
A
few
minutes
later
,
*NL*
when
the
remaining
ones
were
on
their
legs
and
about
to
depart
,
Fray
*NL*
came
back
again
in
a
hurry
.
Flourishing
his
finger
ominously
he
*NL*
threw
a
gaze
teeming
with
tidings
just
where
his
eye
alighted
by
*NL*
accident
,
which
happened
to
be
in
Joseph
Poorgrass
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O

starting
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a-brewing

asked
Jacob

Mark

*NL*
*NL*
``

is

see
all
was
safe
,
as

coming
in

found

creeping
down
the
granary

with
half
a
a

of

fleed

my

The
question
was
such
a
profound
one
that
Henery
was
obliged
to
drink
*NL*
there
and
then
from
the
large
cup
till
the
bottom
was
distinctly
*NL*
visible
inside

Before

the

half-way
down

down

lover
*NL*
of
hers
might
have
come
to
the
house
if
he
had
been
a
respectable
*NL*
lad
.
The
most
mysterious
matter
connected
with
her
absence
--
indeed
,
*NL*
the
only
thing
which
gives
me
serious
alarm
--
is
that
she
was
seen
*NL*
to
go
out
of
the
house
by
Maryann
with
only
her
indoor
working
gown
*NL*
on
--
not
even
a
bonnet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
mean
,
ma'am
,
excusing
my
words
,
that
a
young
woman
would
*NL*
hardly
go
to
see
her
young
man
without
dressing
up
,
''
said
Jacob
,
*NL*
turning
his
mental
vision
upon
past
experiences
.
``
That
's
true
--
she
*NL*
would
not
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
,
I
think
,
a
bundle
,
though
I
could
n't
see
very
well
,
''
said
a
*NL*
female
voice
from
another
window
,
which
seemed
that
of
Maryann
.
``
But
*NL*
she
had
no
young
man
about
here
.
Hers
lives
in
Casterbridge
,
and
I
*NL*
believe
he
's
a
soldier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
his
name
?
''
Bathsheba
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
mistress
;
she
was
very
close
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
might
be
able
to
find
out
if
I
went
to
Casterbridge
*NL*
barracks
,
''
said
William
Smallbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
if
she
does
n't
return
to-morrow
,
mind
you
go
there
and
try
*NL*
to
discover
which
man
it
is
,
and
see
him
.
I
feel
more
responsible
*NL*
than
I
should
if
she
had
had
any
friends
or
relations
alive
.
I
do
*NL*
hope
she
has
come
to
no
harm
through
a
man
of
that
kind
...
And
then
*NL*
there
's
this
disgraceful
affair
of
the
bailiff
--
but
I
ca
n't
speak
of
*NL*
him
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
had
so
many
reasons
for
uneasiness
that
it
seemed
she
did
*NL*
not
think
it
worth
while
to
dwell
upon
any
particular
one
.
``
Do
as
I
*NL*
told
you
,
then
,
''
she
said
in
conclusion
,
closing
the
casement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
ay
,
mistress
;
we
will
,
''
they
replied
,
and
moved
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
night
at
Coggan
's
,
Gabriel
Oak
,
beneath
the
screen
of
closed
*NL*
eyelids
,
was
busy
with
fancies
,
and
full
of
movement
,
like
a
river
*NL*
flowing
rapidly
under
its
ice
.
Night
had
always
been
the
time
at
*NL*
which
he
saw
Bathsheba
most
vividly
,
and
through
the
slow
hours
*NL*
of
shadow
he
tenderly
regarded
her
image
now
.
It
is
rarely
that
*NL*
the
pleasures
of
the
imagination
will
compensate
for
the
pain
of
*NL*
sleeplessness
,
but
they
possibly
did
with
Oak
to-night
,
for
the
*NL*
delight
of
merely
seeing
her
effaced
for
the
time
his
perception
*NL*
of
the
great
difference
between
seeing
and
possessing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
also
thought
of
plans
for
fetching
his
few
utensils
and
books
from
*NL*
Norcombe

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HOMESTEAD
--
A
VISITOR
--
HALF-CONFIDENCES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
By
daylight
,
the
bower
of
Oak
's
new-found
mistress
,
Bathsheba
*NL*
Everdene
,
presented
itself
as
a
hoary
building
,
of
the
early
stage
of
*NL*
Classic
Renaissance
as
regards
its
architecture
,
and
of
a
proportion
*NL*
which
told
at
a
glance
that
,
as
is
so
frequently
the
case
,
it
had
*NL*
once
been
the
memorial
hall
upon
a
small
estate
around
it
,
now
*NL*
altogether
effaced
as
a
distinct
property
,
and
merged
in
the
vast
*NL*
tract
of
a
non-resident
landlord
,
which
comprised
several
such
modest
*NL*
demesnes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fluted
pilasters
,
worked
from
the
solid
stone
,
decorated
its
front
,
*NL*
and
above
the
roof
the
chimneys
were
panelled
or
columnar
,
some
coped
*NL*
gables
with
finials
and
like
features
still
retaining
traces
of
their
*NL*
Gothic
extraction
.
Soft
brown
mosses
,
like
faded
velveteen
,
formed
*NL*
cushions
upon
the
stone
tiling
,
and
tufts
of
the
houseleek
or
*NL*
sengreen
sprouted
from
the
eaves
of
the
low
surrounding
buildings
.
A
*NL*
gravel
walk
leading
from
the
door
to
the
road
in
front
was
encrusted
*NL*
at
the
sides
with
more
moss
--
here
it
was
a
silver-green
variety
,
the
*NL*
nut-brown
of
the
gravel
being
visible
to
the
width
of
only
a
foot
*NL*
or
two
in
the
centre
.
This
circumstance
,
and
the
generally
sleepy
*NL*
air
of
the
whole
prospect
here
,
together
with
the
animated
and
*NL*
contrasting
state
of
the
reverse
facade
,
suggested
to
the
imagination
*NL*
that
on
the
adaptation
of
the
building
for
farming
purposes
the
*NL*
vital
principle
of
the
house
had
turned
round
inside
its
body
to
*NL*
face
the
other
way
.
Reversals
of
this
kind
,
strange
deformities
,
*NL*
tremendous
paralyses
,
are
often
seen
to
be
inflicted
by
trade
upon
*NL*
edifices
--
either
individual
or
in
the
aggregate
as
streets
and
*NL*
towns
--
which
were
originally
planned
for
pleasure
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lively
voices
were
heard
this
morning
in
the
upper
rooms
,
the
*NL*
main
staircase
to
which
was
of
hard
oak
,
the
balusters
,
heavy
as
*NL*
bed-posts
,
being
turned
and
moulded
in
the
quaint
fashion
of
their
*NL*
century
,
the
handrail
as
stout
as
a
parapet-top
,
and
the
stairs
*NL*
themselves
continually
twisting
round
like
a
person
trying
to
look
*NL*
over
his
shoulder
.
Going
up
,
the
floors
above
were
found
to
have
a
*NL*
very
irregular
surface
,
rising
to
ridges
,
sinking
into
valleys
;
and
*NL*
being
just
then
uncarpeted
,
the
face
of
the
boards
was
seen
to
be
*NL*
eaten
into
innumerable
vermiculations
.
Every
window
replied
by
a
*NL*
clang
to
the
opening
and
shutting
of
every
door
,
a
tremble
followed
*NL*
every
bustling
movement
,
and
a
creak
accompanied
a
walker
about
the
*NL*
house
,
like
a
spirit
,
wherever
he
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
room
from
which
the
conversation
proceeded
Bathsheba
and
her
*NL*
servant-companion
,
Liddy
Smallbury
,
were
to
be
discovered
sitting
*NL*
upon
the
floor
,
and
sorting
a
complication
of
papers
,
books
,
bottles
,
*NL*
and
rubbish
spread
out
thereon
--
remnants
from
the
household
stores
*NL*
of
the
late
occupier
.
Liddy
,
the
maltster
's
great-granddaughter
,
*NL*
was
about
Bathsheba
's
equal
in
age
,
and
her
face
was
a
prominent
*NL*
advertisement
of
the
light-hearted
English
country
girl
.
The
beauty
*NL*
her
features
might
have
lacked
in
form
was
amply
made
up
for
by
*NL*
perfection
of
hue
,
which
at
this
winter-time
was
the
softened
*NL*
ruddiness
on
a
surface
of
high
rotundity
that
we
meet
with
in
a
*NL*
Terburg
or
a
Gerard
Douw
;
and
,
like
the
presentations
of
those
great
*NL*
colourists
,
it
was
a
face
which
kept
well
back
from
the
boundary
*NL*
between
comeliness
and
the
ideal
.
Though
elastic
in
nature
she
was
*NL*
less
daring
than
Bathsheba
,
and
occasionally
showed
some
earnestness
,
*NL*
which
consisted
half
of
genuine
feeling
,
and
half
of
mannerliness
*NL*
superadded
by
way
of
duty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
a
partly-opened
door
the
noise
of
a
scrubbing-brush
led
up
to
*NL*
the
charwoman
,
Maryann
Money
,
a
person
who
for
a
face
had
a
circular
*NL*
disc
,
furrowed
less
by
age
than
by
long
gazes
of
perplexity
at
*NL*
distant
objects
.
To
think
of
her
was
to
get
good-humoured
;
to
speak
*NL*
of
her
was
to
raise
the
image
of
a
dried
Normandy
pippin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
your
scrubbing
a
moment
,
''
said
Bathsheba
through
the
door
to
*NL*
her
.
``
I
hear
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maryann
suspended
the
brush
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tramp
of
a
horse
was
apparent
,
approaching
the
front
of
the
*NL*
building
.
The
paces
slackened
,
turned
in
at
the
wicket
,
and
,
what
*NL*
was
most
unusual
,
came
up
the
mossy
path
close
to
the
door
.
The
door
*NL*
was
tapped
with
the
end
of
a
crop
or
stick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
impertinence
!
''
said
Liddy
,
in
a
low
voice
.
``
To
ride
up
the
*NL*
footpath
like
that
!
Why
did
n't
he
stop
at
the
gate
?
Lord
!
'T
is
a
*NL*
gentleman
!
I
see
the
top
of
his
hat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
quiet
!
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
further
expression
of
Liddy
's
concern
was
continued
by
aspect
*NL*
instead
of
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
does
n't
Mrs.
Coggan
go
to
the
door
?
''
Bathsheba
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Rat-tat-tat-tat
resounded
more
decisively
from
Bathsheba
's
oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maryann
,
you
go
!
''
said
she
,
fluttering
under
the
onset
of
a
crowd
of
*NL*
romantic
possibilities
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
ma'am
--
see
,
here
's
a
mess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
argument
was
unanswerable
after
a
glance
at
Maryann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liddy
--
you
must
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
held
up
her
hands
and
arms
,
coated
with
dust
from
the
rubbish
*NL*
they
were
sorting
,
and
looked
imploringly
at
her
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
--
Mrs.
Coggan
is
going
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
exhaling
her
relief
*NL*
in
the
form
of
a
long
breath
which
had
lain
in
her
bosom
a
minute
or
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
,
and
a
deep
voice
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Miss
Everdene
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
see
,
sir
,
''
said
Mrs.
Coggan
,
and
in
a
minute
appeared
in
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
,
what
a
thirtover
place
this
world
is
!
''
continued
Mrs.
Coggan
*NL*
-LRB-
a
wholesome-looking
lady
who
had
a
voice
for
each
class
of
remark
*NL*
according
to
the
emotion
involved
;
who
could
toss
a
pancake
or
twirl
*NL*
a
mop
with
the
accuracy
of
pure
mathematics
,
and
who
at
this
moment
*NL*
showed
hands
shaggy
with
fragments
of
dough
and
arms
encrusted
with
*NL*
flour
-RRB-
.
``
I
am
never
up
to
my
elbows
,
Miss
,
in
making
a
pudding
but
*NL*
one
of
two
things
do
happen
--
either
my
nose
must
needs
begin
*NL*
tickling
,
and
I
ca
n't
live
without
scratching
it
,
or
somebody
knocks
*NL*
at
the
door
.
Here
's
Mr.
Boldwood
wanting
to
see
you
,
Miss
Everdene
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
's
dress
being
a
part
of
her
countenance
,
and
any
disorder
in
*NL*
the
one
being
of
the
same
nature
with
a
malformation
or
wound
in
the
*NL*
other
,
Bathsheba
said
at
once
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
see
him
in
this
state
.
Whatever
shall
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not-at-homes
were
hardly
naturalized
in
Weatherbury
farmhouses
,
so
*NL*
Liddy
suggested
--
``
Say
you
're
a
fright
with
dust
,
and
ca
n't
come
*NL*
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
sounds
very
well

said
Mrs.
Coggan
,
critically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
I
ca
n't
see
him
--
that
will
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Coggan
went
downstairs
,
and
returned
the
answer
as
requested
,
*NL*
adding
,
however
,
on
her
own
responsibility
,
``
Miss
is
dusting
bottles
,
*NL*
sir
,
and
is
quite
a
object
--
that
's
why
't
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well
,
''
said
the
deep
voice
indifferently
.
``
All
I
wanted
to
*NL*
ask
was
,
if
anything
had
been
heard
of
Fanny
Robin
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

we
may

Smallbury

to

young
man
lives
,
as
is
supposed
,
and
the
*NL*
other
men
be
inquiring

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
's
tramp
then
recommenced
and
retreated
,
and
the
door
*NL*
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is

Boldwood

said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

this
dusting
is

I
am
always
in

unfortunate

Bathsheba
said
,
complainingly
.
``
Why
should
he
*NL*
inquire
about
Fanny
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

because

as
she
had
no
friends
in

childhood
,
he
took
her
and

put

school
,
and
got
her

place
here
under
your
uncle

``
What

``
Never

for
two

the
two

spent
a

*NL*
*NL*
A
little
boy
came
up
at
this
moment
and
looked
in
upon
them

This
*NL*
child
was
one
of
the
Coggans
,
who
,
with
the
Smallburys
,
were
as
*NL*
common
among
the
families
of
this
district
as
the
Avons
and
Derwents
*NL*
among
our
rivers
.
He
always
had
a
loosened
tooth
or
a
cut
finger
to
*NL*
show
to
particular
friends
,
which
he
did
with
an
air
of
being
thereby
*NL*
elevated
above
the
common
herd
of
afflictionless
humanity
--
to
which
*NL*
exhibition
people
were
expected
to
say
``
Poor
child
!
''
with
a
dash
of
*NL*
congratulation
as
well
as
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
got
a
pen-nee
!
''
said
Master
Coggan
in
a
scanning
measure
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
who
gave
it
you
,
Teddy
?

said
Liddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mis-terr

He
gave
it
to
me
for
opening
the
gate

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
he

*NL*
*NL*

He
said

I
said

*NL*
Everdene

She
is

staid
woman

she

*NL*
little
man

and
I

,
`
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
naughty
child

What
did
you
say
that
for

*NL*
*NL*
''
'Cause
he
gave
me
the
penny
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
pucker
everything
is
in

said
Bathsheba
,
discontentedly
*NL*
when
the
child
had
gone
.
``
Get
away
,
Maryann
,
or
go
on
with
your
*NL*
scrubbing

or
do
something
!
You
ought
to
be
married
by
this
time
,
*NL*
and
not
here
troubling
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
mistress
--
so
I
did
.
But
what
between
the
poor
men
I
wo
n't
have
,
*NL*
and
the
rich
men
who
wo
n't
have
me

I
stand
as
a
pelican
in
the
*NL*
wilderness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
anybody
ever
want
to
marry
you
miss
?
''
Liddy
ventured
to
ask
when
*NL*
they
were
again
alone
.
``
Lots
of
'em
,
I
daresay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
paused
,
as
if
about
to
refuse
a
reply
,
but
the
temptation
*NL*
to
say
yes
,
since
it
was
really
in
her
power
was
irresistible
by
*NL*
aspiring
virginity
,
in
spite
of
her
spleen
at
having
been
published
*NL*
as
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
man
wanted
to
once
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
highly
experienced
tone
,
and
*NL*
the
image
of
Gabriel
Oak
,
as
the
farmer
,
rose
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
nice
it
must
seem
!
''
said
Liddy
,
with
the
fixed
features
of
*NL*
mental
realization
.
``
And
you
would
n't
have
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
n't
quite
good
enough
for
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
sweet
to
be
able
to
disdain

of

are
glad

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
rather
liked

*NL*
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Of

*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
looked
from
a
back
window
into
the
courtyard
behind
,
which
was
*NL*
now
getting
low-toned
and
dim
with
the
earliest
films
of
night
.
A
*NL*
crooked
file
of
men
was
approaching
the
back
door
.
The
whole
string
*NL*
of
trailing
individuals
advanced
in
the
completest
balance
of
*NL*
intention
,
like
the
remarkable
creatures
known
as
Chain
Salpae
,
which
,
*NL*
distinctly
organized
in
other
respects
,
have
one
will
common
to
a
*NL*
whole
family
.
Some
were
,
as
usual
,
in
snow-white
smock-frocks
of
*NL*
Russia
duck
,
and
some
in
whitey-brown
ones
of
drabbet
--
marked
on
the
*NL*
wrists
,
breasts
,
backs
,
and
sleeves
with
honeycomb-work
.
Two
or
*NL*
three
women
in
pattens
brought
up
the
rear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Philistines
be
upon
us
,
''
said
Liddy
,
making
her
nose
white
*NL*
against
the
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
very
well

Maryann
,
go
down
and
keep
them
in

kitchen

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
MISTRESS
AND
MEN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Half-an-hour
later
Bathsheba
,
in
finished
dress
,
and
followed
by
*NL*
Liddy
,
entered
the
upper
end
of
the
old
hall
to
find
that
her
men
had
*NL*
all
deposited
themselves
on
a
long
form
and
a
settle
at
the
lower
*NL*
extremity
.
She
sat
down
at
a
table
and
opened
the
time-book
,
pen
in
*NL*
her
hand
,
with
a
canvas
money-bag
beside
her
.
From
this
she
poured
*NL*
a
small
heap
of
coin
.
Liddy
chose
a
position
at
her
elbow
and
began
*NL*
to
sew
,
sometimes
pausing
and
looking
round
,
or
,
with
the
air
of
*NL*
a
privileged
person
,
taking
up
one
of
the
half-sovereigns
lying
*NL*
before
her
and
surveying
it
merely
as
a
work
of
art
,
while
strictly
*NL*
preventing
her
countenance
from
expressing
any
wish
to
possess
it
as
*NL*
money
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
before
I
begin
,
men
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
``
I
have
two
matters
to
*NL*
speak
of
.
The
first
is
that
the
bailiff
is
dismissed
for
thieving
,
*NL*
and
that
I
have
formed
a
resolution
to
have
no
bailiff
at
all
,
but
to
*NL*
manage
everything
with
my
own
head
and
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
breathed
an
audible
breath
of
amazement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
next
matter
is
,
have
you
heard
anything
of
Fanny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
done
anything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
Farmer
Boldwood

said
Jacob
Smallbury
,
``
and
I
went
with
him
*NL*
and
two
of
his
men
,
and
dragged

Pond

but
we
found
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
And

new
shepherd

been

Buck
's
Head

there
,
but
nobody
had
seed

said
Laban
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has

William
Smallbury
been
to
Casterbridge
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wants
a
quarter
to

present

said
Bathsheba
,
looking
at
*NL*
her
watch
.
``
I
daresay
he
'll
be
in
directly
.
Well
,
now
then
''
--
she
*NL*
looked
into
the
book
--
``
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
are
you
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

the
person
addressed
.
``
I
be
the
*NL*
personal
name

Poorgrass

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
in
my

eye

In
the
eye
of

people

I
do
n't

say
it

though
public
thought

out

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
do
on
the
farm

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
do
carting
things

the
year

time

*NL*
``
How
much
to
you

*NL*

one

*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
correct

are
ten
shillings

addition

a

present

as
I

comer

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
blushed
slightly
at
the
sense
of
being
generous
in
public
,
*NL*
and
Henery
Fray
,
who
had
drawn
up
towards
her
chair
,
lifted
his
*NL*
eyebrows
and
fingers
to
express
amazement
on
a
small
scale
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
much
do
I
owe
you
--
that
man
in
the
corner
--

's
your
name

*NL*
continued
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Matthew
Moon

ma'am

said
a
singular
framework
of
clothes
with
*NL*
nothing
of
any
consequence
inside
them
,
which
advanced
with
the
toes
*NL*
in
no
definite
direction
forwards
,
but
turned
in
or
out
as
they
*NL*
chanced
to
swing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

you

inquired
the
young
farmer
,
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Henery
Fray

correctingly
,
from
behind
her

to
which
point
he
had
edged
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Bathsheba
,
turning
her
bright
eyes
to
the
*NL*
book

the
sum

Henery

in
an
undertone

Joseph
Poorgrass
,
in
the
background
twitched
,
and
his
lips
became
*NL*
dry
with
fear
of
some
terrible
consequences
,
as
he
saw
Bathsheba
*NL*
summarily
speaking
,
and
Henery
slinking
off
to
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now

For

young

*NL*
``
True

a
woman
in
the
back
quarter

who
had

just
entered
with
clicking
pattens
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

is
that

Bathsheba
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
be
his
lawful

continued
the
voice
with
greater
prominence
*NL*
of
manner
and
tone

This
lady
called
herself
five-and-twenty
,
looked
*NL*
thirty
,
passed
as
thirty-five

and
was
forty

She
was
a
woman
who
*NL*
never
,
like
some
newly
married
,
showed
conjugal
tenderness
in
public
,
*NL*
perhaps
because
she
had
none
to
show
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

again
the

tongue

the

replied

*NL*
``
Heh-heh-heh

laughed
the
married
man
with
a
hideous
effort

appreciation

for
he
was
as
irrepressibly
good-humoured
under
ghastly

snubs
as

``

turning
with

the
shepherd

had
just
appeared
on

said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
Cain
come
by
such
a
name
?
''
asked
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
you
see
,
mem
,
his
pore
mother
,
not
being
a
Scripture-read
woman
,
*NL*
made
a
mistake
at
his
christening
,
thinking
't
was
Abel
killed
Cain
,
*NL*
and
called
en
Cain
,
meaning
Abel
all
the
time
.
The
parson
put
it
*NL*
right
,
but
't
was
too
late
,
for
the
name
could
never
be
got
rid
of
in
*NL*
the
parish
.
'T
is
very
unfortunate
for
the
boy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
rather
unfortunate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
However
,
we
soften
it
down
as
much
as
we
can
,
and
call
him
*NL*
Cainy
.
Ah
,
pore
widow-woman
!
she
cried
her
heart
out
about
it
*NL*
almost
.
She
was
brought
up
by
a
very
heathen
father
and
mother
,
who
*NL*
never
sent
her
to
church
or
school
,
and
it
shows
how
the
sins
of
the
*NL*
parents
are
visited
upon
the
children
,

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Fray
here
drew
up
his
features
to
the
mild
degree
of
melancholy
*NL*
required
when
the
persons
involved
in
the
given
misfortune
do
not
*NL*
belong
to
your
own
family
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
then
,
Cainey
Ball
to
be
under-shepherd
.
And
you
quite
*NL*
understand
your
duties
?
--
you
I
mean
,
Gabriel
Oak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
well
,
I
thank
you
,
Miss
Everdene

''
said
Shepherd
Oak
from
the
*NL*
doorpost
.
``
If
I
do
n't
,
I
'll
inquire

''
Gabriel
was
rather
staggered
*NL*
by
the
remarkable
coolness
of
her
manner
.
Certainly
nobody
without
*NL*
previous
information
would
have
dreamt
that
Oak
and
the
handsome
*NL*
woman
before
whom
he
stood
had
ever
been
other
than
strangers
.
But
*NL*
perhaps
her
air
was
the
inevitable
result
of
the
social
rise
which
*NL*
had
advanced
her
from
a
cottage
to
a
large
house
and
fields
.
The
*NL*
case
is
not
unexampled
in
high
places
.
When
,
in
the
writings
of
the
*NL*
later
poets
,
Jove
and
his
family
are
found
to
have
moved
from
their
*NL*
cramped
quarters
on
the
peak
of
Olympus
into
the
wide
sky
above
it
,
*NL*
their
words
show
a
proportionate
increase
of
arrogance
and
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Footsteps
were
heard
in
the
passage
,
combining
in
their
character
*NL*
the
qualities
both
of
weight
and
measure
,
rather
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
velocity

said
Bathsheba

as
William
,
after
marching
to
*NL*
the
middle
of
the
hall
,
took
a
handkerchief
from
his

wiped

his

*NL*

He

stamped

No

*NL*

The

*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel

listened
with
interest

in
glorious

Every

inside
shook
with
the
blows
of
the
great

his

there

*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
remained
musing
and
said
nothing

for
he
was
in
doubt

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
are
not
likely
to
know
more
to-night

Bathsheba

``
But

*NL*
*NL*
She
then
rose
;
but
before
retiring
,
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
*NL*
with
a
pretty
dignity
,
to
which
her
mourning

added
a
soberness

that
was
hardly
to
be
found
in
the

themselves

Then
this
small

stepped
from

surged
out
of

the
hall

her
black
silk
dress
licking
up
a
few
straws

dragging

them
along

scratching
noise
upon

floor

Liddy

elevating

her
feelings
to
the
occasion
from
a
sense

grandeur

floated
*NL*
off
behind
Bathsheba
with
a
milder
dignity
not

free
from

travesty

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
OUTSIDE
THE
BARRACKS
--
SNOW
--
A
MEETING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
dreariness
nothing
could
surpass
a
prospect
in
the
outskirts
of
a
*NL*
certain
town
and
military
station
,
many
miles
north
of
Weatherbury
,
*NL*
at
a
later
hour
on
this
same
snowy
evening
--
if
that
may
be
called
a
*NL*
prospect
of
which
the
chief
constituent
was
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
night
when
sorrow
may
come
to
the
brightest
without
causing
*NL*
any
great
sense
of
incongruity
:
when
,
with
impressible
persons
,
love
*NL*
becomes
solicitousness
,
hope
sinks
to
misgiving
,
and
faith
to
hope
:
*NL*
when
the
exercise
of
memory
does
not
stir
feelings
of
regret
at
*NL*
opportunities
for
ambition
that
have
been
passed
by
,
and
anticipation
*NL*
does
not
prompt
to
enterprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scene
was
a
public
path
,
bordered
on
the
left
hand
by
a
river
,
*NL*
behind
which
rose
a
high
wall
.
On
the
right
was
a
tract
of
land
,
*NL*
partly
meadow
and
partly
moor
,
reaching
,
at
its
remote
verge
,
to
a
*NL*
wide
undulating
upland
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
changes
of
the
seasons
are
less
obtrusive
on
spots
of
this
*NL*
kind
than
amid
woodland
scenery
.
Still
,
to
a
close
observer
,
they
*NL*
are
just
as
perceptible
;
the
difference
is
that
their
media
of
*NL*
manifestation
are
less
trite
and
familiar
than
such
well-known
ones
*NL*
as
the
bursting
of
the
buds
or
the
fall
of
the
leaf
.
Many
are
not
*NL*
so
stealthy
and
gradual
as
we
may
be
apt
to
imagine
in
considering
*NL*
the
general
torpidity
of
a
moor
or
waste
.
Winter
,
in
coming
to
the
*NL*
country
hereabout
,
advanced
in
well-marked
stages
,
wherein
might
*NL*
have
been
successively
observed
the
retreat
of
the
snakes
,
the
*NL*
transformation
of
the
ferns
,
the
filling
of
the
pools
,
a
rising
of
*NL*
fogs
,
the
embrowning
by
frost
,
the
collapse
of
the
fungi
,
and
an
*NL*
obliteration
by
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
climax
of
the
series
had
been
reached
to-night
on
the
aforesaid
*NL*
moor
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
the
season
its
irregularities
were
*NL*
forms
without
features
;
suggestive
of
anything
,
proclaiming
nothing
,
*NL*
and
without
more
character
than
that
of
being
the
limit
of
something
*NL*
else
--
the
lowest
layer
of
a
firmament
of
snow
.
From
this
chaotic
*NL*
skyful
of
crowding
flakes
the
mead
and
moor
momentarily
received
*NL*
additional
clothing
,
only
to
appear
momentarily
more
naked
thereby
.
*NL*
The
vast
arch
of
cloud
above
was
strangely
low
,
and
formed
as
it
were
*NL*
the
roof
of
a
large
dark
cavern
,
gradually
sinking
in
upon
its
floor
;
*NL*
for
the
instinctive
thought
was
that
the
snow
lining
the
heavens
and
*NL*
that
encrusting
the
earth
would
soon
unite
into
one
mass
without
any
*NL*
intervening
stratum
of
air
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
turn
our
attention
to
the
left-hand
characteristics
;
which
were
*NL*
flatness
in
respect
of
the
river
,
verticality
in
respect
of
the
wall
*NL*
behind
it
,
and
darkness
as
to
both
.
These
features
made
up
the
mass
.
*NL*
If
anything
could
be
darker
than
the
sky
,
it
was
the
wall
,
and
if
any
*NL*
thing
could
be
gloomier
than
the
wall
it
was
the
river
beneath
.
The
*NL*
indistinct
summit
of
the
facade
was
notched
and
pronged
by
chimneys
*NL*
here
and
there
,
and
upon
its
face
were
faintly
signified
the
oblong
*NL*
shapes
of
windows
,
though
only
in
the
upper
part
.
Below
,
down
to
the
*NL*
water
's
edge
,
the
flat
was
unbroken
by
hole
or
projection
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
indescribable
succession
of
dull
blows
,
perplexing
in
their
*NL*
regularity
,
sent
their
sound
with
difficulty
through
the
fluffy
*NL*
atmosphere
.
It
was
a
neighbouring
clock
striking
ten
.
The
bell
was
*NL*
in
the
open
air
,
and
being
overlaid
with
several
inches
of
muffling
*NL*
snow
,
had
lost
its
voice
for
the
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
this
hour
the
snow
abated
:
ten
flakes
fell
where
twenty
had
*NL*
fallen
,
then
one
had
the
room
of
ten
.
Not
long
after
a
form
moved
*NL*
by
the
brink
of
the
river
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
its
outline
upon
the
colourless
background
,
a
close
observer
*NL*
might
have
seen
that
it
was
small
.
This
was
all
that
was
positively
*NL*
discoverable
,
though
it
seemed
human
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
shape
went
slowly
along
,
but
without
much
exertion
,
for
the
snow
,
*NL*
though
sudden
,
was
not
as
yet
more
than
two
inches
deep
.
At
this
*NL*
time
some
words
were
spoken
aloud
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
.
Two
.
Three
.
Four
.
Five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
each
utterance
the
little
shape
advanced
about
half
a
dozen
*NL*
yards
.
It
was
evident
now
that
the
windows
high
in
the
wall
were
*NL*
being
counted
.
The
word
``
Five
''
represented
the
fifth
window
from
the
*NL*
end
of
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
spot
stopped
,
and
dwindled
smaller
.
The
figure
was
*NL*
stooping
.
Then
a
morsel
of
snow
flew
across
the
river
towards
the
*NL*
fifth
window
.
It
smacked
against
the
wall
at
a
point
several
yards
*NL*
from
its
mark
.
The
throw
was
the
idea
of
a
man
conjoined
with
the
*NL*
execution
of
a
woman
.
No
man
who
had
ever
seen
bird
,
rabbit
,
or
*NL*
squirrel
in
his
childhood
,
could
possibly
have
thrown
with
such
utter
*NL*
imbecility
as
was
shown
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
attempt
,
and
another
;
till
by
degrees
the
wall
must
have
*NL*
become
pimpled
with
the
adhering
lumps
of
snow
.
At
last
one
fragment
*NL*
struck
the
fifth
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
would
have
been
seen
by
day
to
be
of
that
deep
smooth
sort
*NL*
which
races
middle
and
sides
with
the
same
gliding
precision
,
any
*NL*
irregularities
of
speed
being
immediately
corrected
by
a
small
*NL*
whirlpool
.
Nothing
was
heard
in
reply
to
the
signal
but
the
gurgle
*NL*
and
cluck
of
one
of
these
invisible
wheels
--
together
with
a
few
small
*NL*
sounds
which
a
sad
man
would
have
called
moans
,
and
a
happy
man
*NL*
laughter
--
caused
by
the
flapping
of
the
waters
against
trifling
*NL*
objects
in
other
parts
of
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
window
was
struck
again
in
the
same
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
noise
was
heard
,
apparently
produced
by
the
opening
of
the
*NL*
window
.
This
was
followed
by
a
voice
from
the
same
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tones
were
masculine
,
and
not
those
of
surprise
.
The
high
*NL*
wall
being
that
of
a
barrack
,
and
marriage
being
looked
upon
with
*NL*
disfavour
in
the
army
,
assignations
and
communications
had
probably
*NL*
been
made
across
the
river
before
to-night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
Sergeant
Troy
?
''
said
the
blurred
spot
in
the
snow
,
*NL*
tremulously
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
person
was
so
much
like
a
mere
shade
upon
the
earth
,
and
the
*NL*
other
speaker
so
much
a
part
of
the
building
,
that
one
would
have
*NL*
said
the
wall
was
holding
a
conversation
with
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
came
suspiciously
from
the
shadow
.
``
What
girl
are
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Frank
--
do
n't
you
know
me
?
''
said
the
spot
.
``
Your
wife
,
Fanny
*NL*
Robin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
!
''
said
the
wall
,
in
utter
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
the
girl
,
with
a
half-suppressed
gasp
of
emotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
in
the
woman
's
tone
which
is
not
that
of
the
*NL*
wife
,
and
there
was
a
manner
in
the
man
which
is
rarely
a
husband
's
.
*NL*
The
dialogue
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
come
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
asked
which
was
your
window
.
Forgive
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
expect
you
to-night
.
Indeed
,
I
did
not
think
you
would
*NL*
come
at
all
.
It
was
a
wonder
you
found
me
here
.
I
am
orderly
*NL*
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
I
was
to
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
said
that
you
might
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
mean
that
I
might
.
You
are
glad
to
see
me
,
Frank
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
--
come
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
My
dear
Fan
,
no
!
The
bugle
has
sounded
,
the
barrack
gates
are
*NL*
closed
,
and
I
have
no
leave

We
are
all
of
us
as
good
as

the
*NL*
county
gaol
till
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
I
sha
n't
see
you
till
then
!
''
The
words
were
in
a
faltering
*NL*
tone
of
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
you
get
here
from
Weatherbury
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
walked
--
some
part
of
the
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
surprised

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
``

*NL*

n't

It

*NL*
``
Never

*NL*

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
Is

*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night

Frank

good-night

*NL*
*NL*
And
the
noise
was
again
heard
of
a
window
closing
.
The
little
spot
*NL*
moved
away
.
When
she
passed
the
corner
a
subdued
exclamation
was
*NL*
heard
inside
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
--
ho
--
Sergeant
--
ho
--
ho
!
''
An
expostulation
followed
,
but
it
was
*NL*
indistinct
;
and
it
became
lost
amid
a
low
peal
of
laughter
,
which
was
*NL*
hardly
distinguishable
from
the
gurgle
of
the
tiny
whirlpools
*NL*
outside

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
FARMERS
--
A
RULE
--
AN
EXCEPTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
public
evidence
of
Bathsheba
's
decision
to
be
a
farmer
in
*NL*
her
own
person
and
by
proxy
no
more
was
her
appearance
the
following
*NL*
market-day
in
the
cornmarket
at
Casterbridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
low
though
extensive
hall
,
supported
by
beams
and
pillars
,
*NL*
and
latterly
dignified
by
the
name
of
Corn
Exchange
,
was
thronged
*NL*
with
hot
men
who
talked
among
each
other
in
twos
and
threes
,
the
*NL*
speaker
of
the
minute
looking
sideways
into
his
auditor
's
face
and
*NL*
concentrating
his
argument
by
a
contraction
of
one
eyelid
during
*NL*
delivery
.
The
greater
number
carried
in
their
hands
ground-ash
*NL*
saplings
,
using
them
partly
as
walking-sticks
and
partly
for
poking
*NL*
up
pigs
,
sheep
,
neighbours
with
their
backs
turned
,
and
restful
*NL*
things
in
general
,
which
seemed
to
require
such
treatment
in
the
*NL*
course
of
their
peregrinations
.
During
conversations
each
subjected
*NL*
his
sapling
to
great
varieties
of
usage
--
bending
it
round
his
back
,
*NL*
forming
an
arch
of
it
between
his
two
hands
,
overweighting
it
on
the
*NL*
ground
till
it
reached
nearly
a
semicircle
;
or
perhaps
it
was
hastily
*NL*
tucked
under
the
arm
whilst
the
sample-bag
was
pulled
forth
and
a
*NL*
handful
of
corn
poured
into
the
palm
,
which
,
after
criticism
,
was
*NL*
flung
upon
the
floor
,
an
issue
of
events
perfectly
well
known
to
*NL*
half-a-dozen
acute
town-bred
fowls
which
had
as
usual
crept
into
the
*NL*
building
unobserved
,
and
waited
the
fulfilment
of
their
anticipations
*NL*
with
a
high-stretched
neck
and
oblique
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Among
these
heavy
yeomen
a
feminine
figure
glided
,
the
single
one
of
*NL*
her
sex
that
the
room
contained
.
She
was
prettily
and
even
daintily
*NL*
dressed
.
She
moved
between
them
as
a
chaise
between
carts
,
was
heard
*NL*
after
them
as
a
romance
after
sermons
,
was
felt
among
them
like
a
*NL*
breeze
among
furnaces
.
It
had
required
a
little
determination
--
far
*NL*
more
than
she
had
at
first
imagined
--
to
take
up
a
position
here
,
for
*NL*
at
her
first
entry
the
lumbering
dialogues
had
ceased
,
nearly
every
*NL*
face
had
been
turned
towards
her
,
and
those
that
were
already
turned
*NL*
rigidly
fixed
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
or
three
only
of
the
farmers
were
personally
known
to
Bathsheba
,
*NL*
and
to
these
she
had
made
her
way
.
But
if
she
was
to
be
the
*NL*
practical
woman
she
had
intended
to
show
herself
,
business
must
*NL*
be
carried
on
,
introductions
or
none
,
and
she
ultimately
acquired
*NL*
confidence
enough
to
speak
and
reply
boldly
to
men
merely
known
to
*NL*
her
by
hearsay
.
Bathsheba
too
had
her
sample-bags
,
and
by
degrees
*NL*
adopted
the
professional
pour
into
the
hand
--
holding
up
the
grains
*NL*
in
her
narrow
palm
for
inspection
,
in
perfect
Casterbridge
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
in
the
exact
arch
of
her
upper
unbroken
row
of
teeth
,
and
*NL*
in
the
keenly
pointed
corners
of
her
red
mouth
when
,
with
parted
*NL*
lips
,
she
somewhat
defiantly
turned
up
her
face
to
argue
a
point
with
*NL*
a
tall
man
,
suggested
that
there
was
potentiality
enough
in
that
*NL*
lithe
slip
of
humanity
for
alarming
exploits
of
sex
,
and
daring
*NL*
enough
to
carry
them
out
.
But
her
eyes
had
a
softness
--
invariably
a
*NL*
softness
--
which
,
had
they
not
been
dark
,
would
have
seemed
mistiness
;
*NL*
as
they
were
,
it
lowered
an
expression
that
might
have
been
piercing
*NL*
to
simple
clearness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Strange
to
say
of
a
woman
in
full
bloom
and
vigor
,
she
always
allowed
*NL*
her
interlocutors
to
finish
their
statements
before
rejoining
with
*NL*
hers
.
In
arguing
on
prices
,
she
held
to
her
own
firmly
,
as
was
*NL*
natural
in
a
dealer
,
and
reduced
theirs
persistently
,
as
was
*NL*
inevitable
in
a
woman
.
But
there
was
an
elasticity
in
her
firmness
*NL*
which
removed
it
from
obstinacy
,
as
there
was
a
_
naivete
_
in
her
*NL*
cheapening
which
saved
it
from
meanness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
of
the
farmers
with
whom
she
had
no
dealings
-LRB-
by
far
the
*NL*
greater
part
-RRB-
were
continually
asking
each
other
,
``
Who
is
she
?
''
*NL*
The
reply
would
be
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farmer
Everdene
's
niece
;
took
on
Weatherbury
Upper
Farm
;
turned
away
*NL*
the
baily
,
and
swears
she
'll
do
everything
herself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
man
would
then
shake
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
't
is
a
pity
she
's
so
headstrong
,
''
the
first
would
say
.
``
But
we
*NL*
ought
to
be
proud
of
her
here
--
she
lightens
up
the
old
place
.
'T
is
*NL*
such
a
shapely
maid
,
however
,
that
she
'll
soon
get
picked
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
ungallant
to
suggest
that
the
novelty
of
her
engagement
*NL*
in
such
an
occupation
had
almost
as
much
to
do
with
the
magnetism
*NL*
as
had
the
beauty
of
her
face
and
movements
.
However
,
the
interest
*NL*
was
general
,
and
this
Saturday
's
_
debut
_
in
the
forum
,
whatever
it
*NL*
may
have
been
to
Bathsheba
as
the
buying
and
selling
farmer
,
was
*NL*
unquestionably
a
triumph
to
her
as
the
maiden
.
Indeed
,
the
sensation
*NL*
was
so
pronounced
that
her
instinct
on
two
or
three
occasions
was
*NL*
merely
to
walk
as
a
queen
among
these
gods
of
the
fallow
,
like
a
*NL*
little
sister
of
a
little
Jove
,
and
to
neglect
closing
prices
*NL*
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
numerous
evidences
of
her
power
to
attract
were
only
thrown
into
*NL*
greater
relief
by
a
marked
exception
.
Women
seem
to
have
eyes
in
*NL*
their
ribbons
for
such
matters
as
these
.
Bathsheba
,
without
looking
*NL*
within
a
right
angle
of
him
,
was
conscious
of
a
black
sheep
among
the
*NL*
flock
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
perplexed
her
first
.
If
there
had
been
a
respectable
minority
on
*NL*
either
side
,
the
case
would
have
been
most
natural
.
If
nobody
had
*NL*
regarded
her
,
she
would
have
taken
the
matter
indifferently
--
such
*NL*
cases
had
occurred
.
If
everybody
,
this
man
included
,
she
would
have
*NL*
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
course
--
people
had
done
so
before
.
But
the
*NL*
smallness
of
the
exception
made
the
mystery
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
soon
knew
thus
much
of
the
recusant
's
appearance
.
He
was
a
*NL*
gentlemanly
man
,
with
full
and
distinctly
outlined
Roman
features
,
*NL*
the
prominences
of
which
glowed
in
the
sun
with
a
bronze-like
*NL*
richness
of
tone
.
He
was
erect
in
attitude
,
and
quiet
in
demeanour
.
*NL*
One
characteristic
pre-eminently
marked
him
--
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Apparently
he
had
some
time
ago
reached
that
entrance
to
middle
age
*NL*
at
which
a
man
's
aspect
naturally
ceases
to
alter
for
the
term
of
*NL*
a
dozen
years
or
so
;
and
,
artificially
,
a
woman
's
does
likewise
.
*NL*
Thirty-five
and
fifty
were
his
limits
of
variation
--
he
might
have
*NL*
been
either
,
or
anywhere
between
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
said
that
married
men
of
forty
are
usually
ready
and
*NL*
generous
enough
to
fling
passing
glances
at
any
specimen
of
moderate
*NL*
beauty
they
may
discern
by
the
way
.
Probably
,
as
with
persons
*NL*
playing
whist
for
love
,
the
consciousness
of
a
certain
immunity
under
*NL*
any
circumstances
from
that
worst
possible
ultimate
,
the
having
to
*NL*
pay
,
makes
them
unduly
speculative
.
Bathsheba
was
convinced
that
*NL*
this
unmoved
person
was
not
a
married
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
marketing
was
over
,
she
rushed
off
to
Liddy
,
who
was
waiting
*NL*
for
her
beside
the
yellow
gig
in
which
they
had
driven
to
town
.
*NL*
The
horse
was
put
in
,
and
on
they
trotted
--
Bathsheba
's
sugar
,
tea
,
*NL*
and
drapery
parcels
being
packed
behind
,
and
expressing
in
some
*NL*
indescribable
manner
,
by
their
colour
,
shape
,
and
general
lineaments
,
*NL*
that
they
were
that
young
lady-farmer
's
property
,
and
the
grocer
's
*NL*
and
draper
's
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
through
it
,
Liddy
,
and
it
is
over
.
I
sha
n't
mind
it
*NL*
again
,
for
they
will
all
have
grown
accustomed
to
seeing
me
there
;
*NL*
but
this
morning
it
was
as
bad
as
being
married
--
eyes
everywhere
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knowed
it
would
be
,
''
Liddy
said
.
``
Men
be
such
a
terrible
class
of
*NL*
society
to
look
at
a
body
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
was
one
man
who
had
more
sense
than
to
waste
his
time
upon
*NL*
me
.
''
The
information
was
put
in
this
form
that
Liddy
might
not
for
a
*NL*
moment
suppose
her
mistress
was
at
all
piqued
.
``
A
very
good-looking
*NL*
man
,
''
she
continued
,
``
upright
;
about
forty
,
I
should
think
.
Do
you
*NL*
know
at
all
who
he
could
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
could
n't
think
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
you
guess
at
all
?
''
said
Bathsheba
with
some
disappointment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
a
notion
;
besides
,
't
is
no
difference
,
since
he
took
less
*NL*
notice
of
you
than
any
of
the
rest
.
Now
,
if
he
'd
taken
more
,
it
*NL*
would
have
mattered
a
great
deal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
suffering
from
the
reverse
feeling
just
then
,
and
they
*NL*
bowled
along
in
silence
.
A
low
carriage
,
bowling
along
still
more
*NL*
rapidly
behind
a
horse
of
unimpeachable
breed
,
overtook
and
passed
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
he
is
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
looked
.
``
That
!
That
's
Farmer
Boldwood
--
of
course
't
is
--
the
*NL*
man
you
could
n't
see
the
other
day
when
he
called
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Farmer
Boldwood
,
''
murmured
Bathsheba
,
and
looked
at
him
as
he
*NL*
outstripped
them
.
The
farmer
had
never
turned
his
head
once
,
but
*NL*
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
most
advanced
point
along
the
road
,
passed
as
*NL*
unconsciously
and
abstractedly
as
if
Bathsheba
and
her
charms
were
*NL*
thin
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
an
interesting
man
--
do
n't
you
think
so
?
''
she
remarked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
yes
,
very
.
Everybody
owns
it
,
''
replied
Liddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
he
is
so
wrapt
up
and
indifferent
,
and
seemingly
so
far
*NL*
away
from
all
he
sees
around
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
said
--
but
not
known
for
certain
--
that
he
met
with
some
bitter
*NL*
disappointment
when
he
was
a
young
man
and
merry
.
A
woman
jilted
*NL*
him
,
they
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
always
say
that

and
we
know
very
well

scarcely
ever

jilt
men

't
is
the
men
who
jilt
us

I
expect
it
is
simply
his
nature

to
be
so
reserved

*NL*
*NL*
``
Simply
his
nature

I
expect

nothing
else
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
,
't
is
more
romantic
to

cruelly

after
all

he

*NL*
``
Depend
upon

Oh
yes

I
feel
he
must
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
However
,
we
are
very
apt
to
think
extremes
of
people
.
I
should
n't
*NL*
wonder
after
all
if
it
was
n't
a
little
of
both
--
just
between
the
*NL*
two
--
rather
cruelly
used
and
rather
reserved
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
no
,
miss

I
ca
n't
think
it
between
the
two
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
most
likely

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
,
so
it
is

I
am
convinced
it
is
most
likely

You
may
take

my
word

what

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SORTES
SANCTORUM
--
THE
VALENTINE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Sunday
afternoon
in
the
farmhouse
,
on
the
thirteenth
of
*NL*
February
.
Dinner
being
over
,
Bathsheba
,
for
want
of
a
better
*NL*
companion
,
had
asked
Liddy
to
come
and
sit
with
her
.
The
mouldy
pile
*NL*
was
dreary
in
winter-time
before
the
candles
were
lighted
and
the
*NL*
shutters
closed
;
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
seemed
as
old
as
the
*NL*
walls
;
every
nook
behind
the
furniture
had
a
temperature
of
its
own
,
*NL*
for
the
fire
was
not
kindled
in
this
part
of
the
house
early
in
the
*NL*
day
;
and
Bathsheba
's
new
piano
,
which
was
an
old
one
in
other
annals
,
*NL*
looked
particularly
sloping
and
out
of
level
on
the
warped
floor
*NL*
before
night
threw
a
shade
over
its
less
prominent
angles
and
hid
*NL*
the
unpleasantness
.
Liddy
,
like
a
little
brook
,
though
shallow
,
was
*NL*
always
rippling
;
her
presence
had
not
so
much
weight
as
to
task
*NL*
thought
,
and
yet
enough
to
exercise
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
table
lay
an
old
quarto
Bible
,
bound
in
leather
.
Liddy
*NL*
looking
at
it
said
,
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
ever
find
out
,
miss
,
who
you
are
going
to
marry
by
means
of
*NL*
the
Bible
and
key
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
so
foolish
,
Liddy
.
As
if
such
things
could
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
there
's
a
good
deal
in
it
,
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
,
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
makes
your
heart
beat
fearful
.
Some
believe
in
it
;
some
*NL*
do
n't
;
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
let
's
try
it
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
bounding
from
her
seat
*NL*
with
that
total
disregard
of
consistency
which
can
be
indulged
in
*NL*
towards
a
dependent
,
and
entering
into
the
spirit
of
divination
at
*NL*
once
.
``
Go
and
get
the
front
door
key
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
fetched
it
.
``
I
wish
it
was
n't
Sunday
,
''
she
said
,
on
returning
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
't
is
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
right
week
days
is
right
Sundays
,
''
replied
her
mistress
in
a
*NL*
tone
which
was
a
proof
in
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
was
opened
--
the
leaves
,
drab
with
age
,
being
quite
worn
away
*NL*
at
much-read
verses
by
the
forefingers
of
unpractised
readers
in
*NL*
former
days
,
where
they
were
moved
along
under
the
line
as
an
aid
to
*NL*
the
vision
.
The
special
verse
in
the
Book
of
Ruth
was
sought
out
by
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
and
the
sublime
words
met
her
eye
.
They
slightly
thrilled
*NL*
and
abashed
her
.
It
was
Wisdom
in
the
abstract
facing
Folly
in
the
*NL*
concrete
.
Folly
in
the
concrete
blushed
,
persisted
in
her
intention
,
*NL*
and
placed
the
key
on
the
book
.
A
rusty
patch
immediately
upon
the
*NL*
verse
,
caused
by
previous
pressure
of
an
iron
substance
thereon
,
told
*NL*
that
this
was
not
the
first
time
the
old
volume
had
been
used
for
the
*NL*
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
keep
steady
,
and
be
silent
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
verse
was
repeated
;
the
book
turned
round
;
Bathsheba
blushed
*NL*
guiltily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
did
you
try
?
''
said
Liddy
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
notice
Mr.
Boldwood
's
doings
in
church
this
morning
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
Liddy
continued
,
adumbrating
by
the
remark
the
track
her
thoughts
had
*NL*
taken
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
with
serene
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
pew
is
exactly
opposite
yours
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
did
not
see
his
goings
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
did
not
,
I
tell
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
assumed
a
smaller
physiognomy
,
and
shut
her
lips
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
move
was
unexpected
,
and
proportionately
disconcerting
.
``
What
*NL*
did
he
do
?
''
Bathsheba
said
perforce
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
n't
turn
his
head
to
look
at
you
once
all
the
service
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
he
?
''
again
demanded
her
mistress
,
wearing
a
nettled
look
.
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
ask
him
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
.
But
everybody
else
was
noticing
you
;
and
it
was
odd
he
*NL*
did
n't
.
There
,
't
is
like
him
.
Rich
and
gentlemanly
,
what
does
he
*NL*
care
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
dropped
into
a
silence
intended
to
express
that
she
had
*NL*
opinions
on
the
matter
too
abstruse
for
Liddy
's
comprehension
,
rather
*NL*
than
that
she
had
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
--
I
had
nearly
forgotten
the
valentine
I
bought
yesterday
,
''
*NL*
she
exclaimed
at
length
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Valentine
!
who
for
,
miss
?
''
said
Liddy
.
``
Farmer
Boldwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
single
name
among
all
possible
wrong
ones
that
just
at
*NL*
this
moment
seemed
to
Bathsheba
more
pertinent
than
the
right
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
.
It
is
only
for
little
Teddy
Coggan
.
I
have
promised
him
*NL*
something
,
and
this
will
be
a
pretty
surprise
for
him
.
Liddy
,
you
*NL*
may
as
well
bring
me
my
desk
and
I
'll
direct
it
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
took
from
her
desk
a
gorgeously
illuminated
and
embossed
*NL*
design
in
post-octavo
,
which
had
been
bought
on
the
previous
*NL*
market-day
at
the
chief
stationer
's
in
Casterbridge
.
In
the
centre
*NL*
was
a
small
oval
enclosure
;
this
was
left
blank
,
that
the
sender
*NL*
might
insert
tender
words
more
appropriate
to
the
special
occasion
*NL*
than
any
generalities
by
a
printer
could
possibly
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
a
place
for
writing
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
``
What
shall
I
put
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
of
this
sort
,
I
should
think
,
''
returned
Liddy
promptly
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rose
is
red
,
*NL*
The
violet
blue
,
*NL*
Carnation
's
sweet
,
*NL*
And
so
are
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
shall
be
it
.
It
just
suits
itself
to
a
chubby-faced
child
*NL*
like
him
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
She
inserted
the
words
in
a
small
though
*NL*
legible
handwriting
;
enclosed
the
sheet
in
an
envelope
,
and
dipped
*NL*
her
pen
for
the
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
fun
it
would
be
to
send
it
to
the
stupid
old
Boldwood
,
and
how
*NL*
he
would
wonder
!
''
said
the
irrepressible
Liddy
,
lifting
her
eyebrows
,
*NL*
and
indulging
in
an
awful
mirth
on
the
verge
of
fear
as
she
thought
*NL*
of
the
moral
and
social
magnitude
of
the
man
contemplated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
paused
to
regard
the
idea
at
full
length
.
Boldwood
's
had
*NL*
begun
to
be
a
troublesome
image
--
a
species
of
Daniel
in
her
kingdom
*NL*
who
persisted
in
kneeling
eastward
when
reason
and
common
sense
said
*NL*
that
he
might
just
as
well
follow
suit
with
the
rest
,
and
afford
her
*NL*
the
official
glance
of
admiration
which
cost
nothing
at
all
.
She
was
*NL*
far
from
being
seriously
concerned
about
his
nonconformity
.
Still
,
*NL*
it
was
faintly
depressing
that
the
most
dignified
and
valuable
man
*NL*
in
the
parish
should
withhold
his
eyes
,
and
that
a
girl
like
Liddy
*NL*
should
talk
about
it
.
So
Liddy
's
idea
was
at
first
rather
harassing
*NL*
than
piquant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
do
that
.
He
would
n't
see
any
humour
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
'd
worry
to
death
,
''
said
the
persistent
Liddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
I
do
n't
care
particularly
to
send
it
to
Teddy
,
''
remarked
her
*NL*
mistress
.
``
He
's
rather
a
naughty
child
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
that
he
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
toss
as
men
do
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
idly
.
``
Now
then
,
head
,
*NL*
Boldwood
;
tail
,
Teddy
.
No
,
we
wo
n't
toss
money
on
a
Sunday
,
that
*NL*
would
be
tempting
the
devil
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Toss
this
hymn-book
;
there
ca
n't
be
no
sinfulness
in
that
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Open
,
Boldwood
--
shut
,
Teddy
.
No
;
it
's
more
likely
to
*NL*
fall
open
.
Open
,
Teddy
--
shut
,
Boldwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
book
went
fluttering
in
the
air
and
came
down
shut
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
a
small
yawn
upon
her
mouth
,
took
the
pen
,
and
with
*NL*
off-hand
serenity
directed
the
missive
to
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
light
a
candle
,
Liddy
.
Which
seal
shall
we
use
?
Here
's
a
*NL*
unicorn
's
head
--
there
's
nothing
in
that
.
What
's
this
?
--
two
*NL*
doves
--
no
.
It
ought
to
be
something
extraordinary
,
ought
it
not
,
*NL*
Liddy
?
Here
's
one
with
a
motto
--
I
remember
it
is
some
funny
one
,
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
read
it
.
We
'll
try
this
,
and
if
it
does
n't
do
we
'll
have
*NL*
another
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
large
red
seal
was
duly
affixed
.
Bathsheba
looked
closely
at
the
*NL*
hot
wax
to
discover
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
throwing
down
the
letter
frolicsomely
.
*NL*
''
`
Twould
upset
the
solemnity
of
a
parson
and
clerke
too
.

Liddy
looked
at
the
words
of
the
seal
,
and
read
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
MARRY
ME

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
the
letter
was
sent
,
and
was
duly
sorted
in
*NL*
Casterbridge
post-office
that
night
,
to
be
returned
to
Weatherbury
*NL*
again
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
very
idly
and
unreflectingly
was
this
deed
done
.
Of
love
as
a
*NL*
spectacle
Bathsheba
had
a
fair
knowledge
;
but
of
love
subjectively
*NL*
she
knew
nothing
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EFFECT
OF
THE
LETTER
--
SUNRISE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
At
dusk
,
on
the
evening
of
St.
Valentine
's
Day
,
Boldwood
sat
down
*NL*
to
supper
as
usual
,
by
a
beaming
fire
of
aged
logs
.
Upon
the
*NL*
mantel-shelf
before
him
was
a
time-piece
,
surmounted
by
a
spread
*NL*
eagle
,
and
upon
the
eagle
's
wings
was
the
letter
Bathsheba
had
sent
.
*NL*
Here
the
bachelor
's
gaze
was
continually
fastening
itself
,
till
the
*NL*
large
red
seal
became
as
a
blot
of
blood
on
the
retina
of
his
eye
;
*NL*
and
as
he
ate
and
drank
he
still
read
in
fancy
the
words
thereon
,
*NL*
although
they
were
too
remote
for
his
sight
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
MARRY
ME
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
pert
injunction
was
like
those
crystal
substances
which
,
*NL*
colourless
themselves
,
assume
the
tone
of
objects
about
them
.
Here
,
*NL*
in
the
quiet
of
Boldwood
's
parlour
,
where
everything
that
was
not
*NL*
grave
was
extraneous
,
and
where
the
atmosphere
was
that
of
a
Puritan
*NL*
Sunday
lasting
all
the
week
,
the
letter
and
its
dictum
changed
their
*NL*
tenor
from
the
thoughtlessness
of
their
origin
to
a
deep
solemnity
,
*NL*
imbibed
from
their
accessories
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
the
receipt
of
the
missive
in
the
morning
,
Boldwood
had
felt
*NL*
the
symmetry
of
his
existence
to
be
slowly
getting
distorted
in
the
*NL*
direction
of
an
ideal
passion
.
The
disturbance
was
as
the
first
*NL*
floating
weed
to
Columbus
--
the
contemptibly
little
suggesting
*NL*
possibilities
of
the
infinitely
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
must
have
had
an
origin
and
a
motive
.
That
the
latter
*NL*
was
of
the
smallest
magnitude
compatible
with
its
existence
at
all
,
*NL*
Boldwood
,
of
course
,
did
not
know
.
And
such
an
explanation
did
not
*NL*
strike
him
as
a
possibility
even
.
It
is
foreign
to
a
mystified
*NL*
condition
of
mind
to
realize
of
the
mystifier
that
the
processes
of
*NL*
approving
a
course
suggested
by
circumstance
,
and
of
striking
out
a
*NL*
course
from
inner
impulse
,
would
look
the
same
in
the
result
.
The
*NL*
vast
difference
between
starting
a
train
of
events
,
and
directing
*NL*
into
a
particular
groove
a
series
already
started
,
is
rarely
apparent
*NL*
to
the
person
confounded
by
the
issue
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Boldwood
went
to
bed
he
placed
the
valentine
in
the
corner
of
*NL*
the
looking-glass
.
He
was
conscious
of
its
presence
,
even
when
his
*NL*
back
was
turned
upon
it
.
It
was
the
first
time
in
Boldwood
's
life
*NL*
that
such
an
event
had
occurred
.
The
same
fascination
that
caused
*NL*
him
to
think
it
an
act
which
had
a
deliberate
motive
prevented
*NL*
him
from
regarding
it
as
an
impertinence
.
He
looked
again
at
*NL*
the
direction
.
The
mysterious
influences
of
night
invested
the
*NL*
writing
with
the
presence
of
the
unknown
writer
.
Somebody
's
--
some
*NL*
WOMAN
'S
--
hand
had
travelled
softly
over
the
paper
bearing
his
name
;
*NL*
her
unrevealed
eyes
had
watched
every
curve
as
she
formed
it
;
her
*NL*
brain
had
seen
him
in
imagination
the
while
.
Why
should
she
have
*NL*
imagined
him
?
Her
mouth
--
were
the
lips
red
or
pale
,
plump
or
*NL*
creased
?
--
had
curved
itself
to
a
certain
expression
as
the
pen
went
*NL*
on
--
the
corners
had
moved
with
all
their
natural
tremulousness
:
what
*NL*
had
been
the
expression
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
vision
of
the
woman
writing
,
as
a
supplement
to
the
words
*NL*
written
,
had
no
individuality
.
She
was
a
misty
shape
,
and
well
she
*NL*
might
be
,
considering
that
her
original
was
at
that
moment
sound
*NL*
asleep
and
oblivious
of
all
love
and
letter-writing
under
the
sky
.
*NL*
Whenever
Boldwood
dozed
she
took
a
form
,
and
comparatively
ceased
to
*NL*
be
a
vision
:
when
he
awoke
there
was
the
letter
justifying
the
dream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
shone
to-night
,
and
its
light
was
not
of
a
customary
kind
.
*NL*
His
window
admitted
only
a
reflection
of
its
rays
,
and
the
pale
sheen
*NL*
had
that
reversed
direction
which
snow
gives
,
coming
upward
and
*NL*
lighting
up
his
ceiling
in
an
unnatural
way
,
casting
shadows
in
*NL*
strange
places
,
and
putting
lights
where
shadows
had
used
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
substance
of
the
epistle
had
occupied
him
but
little
in
*NL*
comparison
with
the
fact
of
its
arrival
.
He
suddenly
wondered
*NL*
if
anything
more
might
be
found
in
the
envelope
than
what
he
had
*NL*
withdrawn
.
He
jumped
out
of
bed
in
the
weird
light
,
took
the
*NL*
letter
,
pulled
out
the
flimsy
sheet
,
shook
the
envelope
--
searched
it
.
*NL*
Nothing
more
was
there
.
Boldwood
looked
,
as
he
had
a
hundred
times
*NL*
the
preceding
day
,
at
the
insistent
red
seal
:
``
Marry
me
,
''
he
said
*NL*
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solemn
and
reserved
yeoman
again
closed
the
letter
,
and
stuck
*NL*
it
in
the
frame
of
the
glass
.
In
doing
so
he
caught
sight
of
his
*NL*
reflected
features
,
wan
in
expression
,
and
insubstantial
in
form
.
*NL*
He
saw
how
closely
compressed
was
his
mouth
,
and
that
his
eyes
were
*NL*
wide-spread
and
vacant
.
Feeling
uneasy
and
dissatisfied
with
himself
*NL*
for
this
nervous
excitability
,
he
returned
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
dawn
drew
on
.
The
full
power
of
the
clear
heaven
was
not
*NL*
equal
to
that
of
a
cloudy
sky
at
noon
,
when
Boldwood
arose
and
*NL*
dressed
himself
.
He
descended
the
stairs
and
went
out
towards
the
*NL*
gate
of
a
field
to
the
east
,
leaning
over
which
he
paused
and
looked
*NL*
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
one
of
the
usual
slow
sunrises
of
this
time
of
the
year
,
and
*NL*
the
sky
,
pure
violet
in
the
zenith
,
was
leaden
to
the
northward
,
*NL*
and
murky
to
the
east
,
where
,
over
the
snowy
down
or
ewe-lease
on
*NL*
Weatherbury
Upper
Farm
,
and
apparently
resting
upon
the
ridge
,
the
*NL*
only
half
of
the
sun
yet
visible
burnt
rayless
,
like
a
red
and
*NL*
flameless
fire
shining
over
a
white
hearthstone
.
The
whole
effect
*NL*
resembled
a
sunset
as
childhood
resembles
age
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
other
directions
,
the
fields
and
sky
were
so
much
of
one
colour
by
*NL*
the
snow
,
that
it
was
difficult
in
a
hasty
glance
to
tell
whereabouts
*NL*
the
horizon
occurred
;
and
in
general
there
was
here
,
too
,
that
*NL*
before-mentioned
preternatural
inversion
of
light
and
shade
which
*NL*
attends
the
prospect
when
the
garish
brightness
commonly
in
the
sky
*NL*
is
found
on
the
earth
,
and
the
shades
of
earth
are
in
the
sky
.
Over
*NL*
the
west
hung
the
wasting
moon
,
now
dull
and
greenish-yellow
,
like
*NL*
tarnished
brass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
was
listlessly
noting
how
the
frost
had
hardened
and
glazed
*NL*
the
surface
of
the
snow
,
till
it
shone
in
the
red
eastern
light
with
*NL*
the
polish
of
marble
;
how
,
in
some
portions
of
the
slope
,
withered
*NL*
grass-bents
,
encased
in
icicles
,
bristled
through
the
smooth
wan
*NL*
coverlet
in
the
twisted
and
curved
shapes
of
old
Venetian
glass
;
and
*NL*
how
the
footprints
of
a
few
birds
,
which
had
hopped
over
the
snow
*NL*
whilst
it
lay
in
the
state
of
a
soft
fleece
,
were
now
frozen
to
a
*NL*
short
permanency
.
A
half-muffled
noise
of
light
wheels
interrupted
*NL*
him
.
Boldwood
turned
back
into
the
road
.
It
was
the
mail-cart
--
a
*NL*
crazy
,
two-wheeled
vehicle
,
hardly
heavy
enough
to
resist
a
puff
of
*NL*
wind
.
The
driver
held
out
a
letter
.
Boldwood
seized
it
and
opened
*NL*
it
,
expecting
another
anonymous
one
--
so
greatly
are
people
's
ideas
of
*NL*
probability
a
mere
sense
that
precedent
will
repeat
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
it
is
for
you
,
sir
,
''
said
the
man
,
when
he
saw
*NL*
Boldwood
's
action
.
``
Though
there
is
no
name
,
I
think
it
is
for
your
*NL*
shepherd
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
looked
then
at
the
address
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
New
Shepherd
,
*NL*
Weatherbury
Farm
,
*NL*
Near
Casterbridge
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
what
a
mistake
!
--
it
is
not
mine
.
Nor
is
it
for
my
shepherd
.
It
*NL*
is
for
Miss
Everdene
's
.
You
had
better
take
it
on
to
him
--
Gabriel
*NL*
Oak
--
and
say
I
opened
it
in
mistake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
,
on
the
ridge
,
up
against
the
blazing
sky
,
a
figure
*NL*
was
visible
,
like
the
black
snuff
in
the
midst
of
a
candle-flame
.
*NL*
Then
it
moved
and
began
to
bustle
about
vigorously
from
place
to
*NL*
place
,
carrying
square
skeleton
masses
,
which
were
riddled
by
the
*NL*
same
rays
.
A
small
figure
on
all
fours
followed
behind
.
The
tall
*NL*
form
was
that
of
Gabriel
Oak
;
the
small
one
that
of
George
;
the
*NL*
articles
in
course
of
transit
were
hurdles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
,
''
said
Boldwood
.
``
That
's
the
man
on
the
hill
.
I
'll
take
the
*NL*
letter
to
him
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Boldwood
it
was
now
no
longer
merely
a
letter
to
another
man
.
It
*NL*
was
an
opportunity
.
Exhibiting
a
face
pregnant
with
intention
,
he
*NL*
entered
the
snowy
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
,
at
that
minute
,
descended
the
hill
towards
the
right
.
The
*NL*
glow
stretched
down
in
this
direction
now
,
and
touched
the
distant
*NL*
roof
of
Warren
's
Malthouse
--
whither
the
shepherd
was
apparently
bent
:
*NL*
Boldwood
followed
at
a
distance
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
MORNING
MEETING
--
THE
LETTER
AGAIN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
scarlet
and
orange
light
outside
the
malthouse
did
not
penetrate
*NL*
to
its
interior
,
which
was
,
as
usual
,
lighted
by
a
rival
glow
of
*NL*
similar
hue
,
radiating
from
the
hearth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maltster
,
after
having
lain
down
in
his
clothes
for
a
few
*NL*
hours
,
was
now
sitting
beside
a
three-legged
table
,
breakfasting
of
*NL*
bread
and
bacon
.
This
was
eaten
on
the
plateless
system
,
which
is
*NL*
performed
by
placing
a
slice
of
bread
upon
the
table
,
the
meat
flat
*NL*
upon
the
bread
,
a
mustard
plaster
upon
the
meat
,
and
a
pinch
of
salt
*NL*
upon
the
whole
,
then
cutting
them
vertically
downwards
with
a
large
*NL*
pocket-knife
till
wood
is
reached
,
when
the
severed
lump
is
impaled
*NL*
on
the
knife
,
elevated
,
and
sent
the
proper
way
of
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
maltster
's
lack
of
teeth
appeared
not
to
sensibly
diminish
*NL*
his
powers
as
a
mill
.
He
had
been
without
them
for
so
many
years
*NL*
that
toothlessness
was
felt
less
to
be
a
defect
than
hard
gums
an
*NL*
acquisition
.
Indeed
,
he
seemed
to
approach
the
grave
as
a
hyperbolic
*NL*
curve
approaches
a
straight
line
--
less
directly
as
he
got
nearer
,
*NL*
till
it
was
doubtful
if
he
would
ever
reach
it
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
ashpit
was
a
heap
of
potatoes
roasting
,
and
a
boiling
pipkin
*NL*
of
charred
bread
,
called
``
coffee
''
,
for
the
benefit
of
whomsoever
*NL*
should
call
,
for
Warren
's
was
a
sort
of
clubhouse
,
used
as
an
*NL*
alternative
to
the
inn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
,
says
I
,
we
get
a
fine
day
,
and
then
down
comes
a
snapper
at
*NL*
night
,
''
was
a
remark
now
suddenly
heard
spreading
into
the
malthouse
*NL*
from
the
door
,
which
had
been
opened
the
previous
moment
.
The
form
*NL*
of
Henery
Fray
advanced
to
the
fire
,
stamping
the
snow
from
his
boots
*NL*
when
about
half-way
there
.
The
speech
and
entry
had
not
seemed
to
be
*NL*
at
all
an
abrupt
beginning
to
the
maltster
,
introductory
matter
being
*NL*
often
omitted
in
this
neighbourhood
,
both
from
word
and
deed
,
and
*NL*
the
maltster
having
the
same
latitude
allowed
him
,
did
not
hurry
to
*NL*
reply
.
He
picked
up
a
fragment
of
cheese
,
by
pecking
upon
it
with
*NL*
his
knife
,
as
a
butcher
picks
up
skewers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henery
appeared
in
a
drab
kerseymere
great-coat
,
buttoned
over
his
*NL*
smock-frock
,
the
white
skirts
of
the
latter
being
visible
to
the
*NL*
distance
of
about
a
foot
below
the
coat-tails
,
which
,
when
you
*NL*
got
used
to
the
style
of
dress
,
looked
natural
enough
,
and
even
*NL*
ornamental
--
it
certainly
was
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Matthew
Moon
,
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
and
other
carters
and
waggoners
*NL*
followed
at
his
heels
,
with
great
lanterns
dangling
from
their
hands
,
*NL*
which
showed
that
they
had
just
come
from
the
cart-horse
stables
,
*NL*
where
they
had
been
busily
engaged
since
four
o'clock
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
is
she
getting
on
without
a
baily
?
''
the
maltster
inquired
.
*NL*
Henery
shook
his
head
,
and
smiled
one
of
the
bitter
smiles
,
dragging
*NL*
all
the
flesh
of
his
forehead
into
a
corrugated
heap
in
the
centre
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
'll
rue
it
--
surely
,
surely
!
''
he
said
.
``
Benjy
Pennyways
were
not
*NL*
a
true
man
or
an
honest
baily
--
as
big
a
betrayer
as
Judas
Iscariot
*NL*
himself
.

allowed
his

to
swing
laterally
three

Never

This
was
recognized
by
all
as
the
conclusion
of
some
gloomy
speech
*NL*
which
had
been
expressed
in
thought
alone
during
the
shake
of
the
*NL*
head
;
Henery
meanwhile
retained
several
marks
of
despair
upon
his

face

to
imply
that
they
would
be
required
for
use
again
directly

Henery

signifying
wasted
genius

gazing

at

visible
to

A

pause
ensued
,

as

of

Henery
turned
and
*NL*
blew
out
the
lanterns

the
increase

rendered
no

in

with

A
firm
loud

was
now
heard
stamping
outside

the

was
opened
*NL*
about
six

,

somebody
on

The

was
flung
back

it
kicked
the
wall
and
trembled
from

top
to
bottom
with
the
blow
.
Mr.

appeared
in
the
entry
with
a

steaming
face
,
hay-bands
wound
about
his

to
keep
out
the
snow

*NL*
a
leather

round

waist
outside
the
smock-frock

and
looking

altogether
an

of

world

health

Four
lambs

hung
in
various
embarrassing
attitudes
over
his
shoulders

the

dog
George

by

advanced

retired

lowered
the

't
is
;
but
a
happy
Providence
ordered
that
it
should
be
no
*NL*
worse
,
and
I
feel
my
thanks
.
As
to
shepherd
,
there
,
I
'm
sure
mis
`
ess
*NL*
ought
to
have
made
ye
her
baily
--
such
a
fitting
man
for
'
t
as
you
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mind
owning
that
I
expected
it
,
''
said
Oak
,
frankly
.
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
hoped
for
the
place
.
At
the
same
time
,
Miss
Everdene
has
*NL*
a
right
to
be
her
own
baily
if
she
choose
--
and
to
keep
me
down
to
be
*NL*
a
common
shepherd
only
.
''
Oak
drew
a
slow
breath
,
looked
sadly
into
*NL*
the
bright
ashpit
,
and
seemed
lost
in
thoughts
not
of
the
most
*NL*
hopeful
hue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
genial
warmth
of
the
fire
now
began
to
stimulate
the
nearly
*NL*
lifeless
lambs
to
bleat
and
move
their
limbs
briskly
upon
the
hay
,
*NL*
and
to
recognize
for
the
first
time
the
fact
that
they
were
born
.
*NL*
Their
noise
increased
to
a
chorus
of
baas
,
upon
which
Oak
pulled
the
*NL*
milk-can
from
before
the
fire
,
and
taking
a
small
tea-pot
from
the
*NL*
pocket
of
his
smock-frock
,
filled
it
with
milk
,
and
taught
those
of
*NL*
the
helpless
creatures
which
were
not
to
be
restored
to
their
dams
*NL*
how
to
drink
from
the
spout
--
a
trick
they
acquired
with
astonishing
*NL*
aptitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
she
do
n't
even
let
ye
have
the
skins
of
the
dead
lambs
,
I
hear
?
''
*NL*
resumed
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
his
eyes
lingering
on
the
operations
of
Oak
*NL*
with
the
necessary
melancholy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
have
them
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
be
very
badly
used
,
shepherd
,
''
hazarded
Joseph
again
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
getting
Oak
as
an
ally
in
lamentation
after
all
.
``
I
think
she
's
*NL*
took
against
ye
--
that
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
not
at
all
,
''
replied
Gabriel
,
hastily
,
and
a
sigh
escaped
*NL*
him
,
which
the
deprivation
of
lamb
skins
could
hardly
have
caused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
any
further
remark
had
been
added
a
shade
darkened
the
door
,
*NL*
and
Boldwood
entered
the
malthouse
,
bestowing
upon
each
a
nod
of
a
*NL*
quality
between
friendliness
and
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Oak
,
I
thought
you
were
here
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
met
the
mail-cart
*NL*
ten
minutes
ago
,
and
a
letter
was
put
into
my
hand
,
which
I
opened
*NL*
without
reading
the
address
.
I
believe
it
is
yours
.
You
must
excuse
*NL*
the
accident
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
--
not
a
bit
of
difference
,
Mr.
Boldwood
--
not
a
bit
,
''
said
*NL*
Gabriel
,
readily
.
He
had
not
a
correspondent
on
earth
,
nor
was
there
*NL*
a
possible
letter
coming
to
him
whose
contents
the
whole
parish
would
*NL*
not
have
been
welcome
to
peruse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
stepped
aside
,
and
read
the
following
in
an
unknown
hand
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
FRIEND
,
--
I
do
not
know
your
name
,
but
I
think
these
*NL*
few
lines
will
reach
you
,
which
I
wrote
to
thank
you
for
*NL*
your
kindness
to
me
the
night
I
left
Weatherbury
in
a
*NL*
reckless
way
.
I
also
return
the
money
I
owe
you
,
which
you
*NL*
will
excuse
my
not
keeping
as
a
gift
.
All
has
ended
well
,
*NL*
and
I
am
happy
to
say
I
am
going
to
be
married
to
the
young
*NL*
man
who
has
courted
me
for
some
time
--
Sergeant
Troy
,
of
*NL*
the
11th
Dragoon
Guards
,
now
quartered
in
this
town
.
He
*NL*
would
,
I
know
,
object
to
my
having
received
anything
except
*NL*
as
a
loan
,
being
a
man
of
great
respectability
and
high
*NL*
honour
--
indeed
,
a
nobleman
by
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
should
be
much
obliged
to
you
if
you
would
keep
the
*NL*
contents
of
this
letter
a
secret
for
the
present
,
dear
*NL*
friend
.
We
mean
to
surprise
Weatherbury
by
coming
there
*NL*
soon
as
husband
and
wife
,
though
I
blush
to
state
it
to
one
*NL*
nearly
a
stranger
.
The
sergeant
grew
up
in
Weatherbury
.
*NL*
Thanking
you
again
for
your
kindness
,
*NL*
*NL*
I
am
,
your
sincere
well-wisher
,
*NL*
FANNY
ROBIN
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
read
it
,
Mr.
Boldwood
?
''
said
Gabriel
;
``
if
not
,
you
had
*NL*
better
do
so
.
I
know
you
are
interested
in
Fanny
Robin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
read
the
letter
and
looked
grieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
--
poor
Fanny
!
the
end
she
is
so
confident
of
has
not
yet
*NL*
come
,
she
should
remember
--
and
may
never
come
.
I
see
she
gives
no
*NL*
address
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
sort
of
a
man
is
this
Sergeant
Troy
?
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
H
'm
--
I
'm
afraid
not
one
to
build
much
hope
upon
in
such
a
case
as
*NL*
this
,
''
the
farmer
murmured
,
``
though
he
's
a
clever
fellow
,
and
up
to
*NL*
everything
.
A
slight
romance
attaches
to
him
,
too
.
His
mother
was
*NL*
a
French
governess
,
and
it
seems
that
a
secret
attachment
existed
*NL*
between
her
and
the
late
Lord
Severn
.
She
was
married
to
a
poor
*NL*
medical
man
,
and
soon
after
an
infant
was
born
;
and
while
money
was
*NL*
forthcoming
all
went
on
well
.
Unfortunately
for
her
boy
,
his
best
*NL*
friends
died
;
and
he
got
then
a
situation
as
second
clerk
at
a
*NL*
lawyer
's
in
Casterbridge
.
He
stayed
there
for
some
time
,
and
might
*NL*
have
worked
himself
into
a
dignified
position
of
some
sort
had
he
not
*NL*
indulged
in
the
wild
freak
of
enlisting
.
I
have
much
doubt
if
ever
*NL*
little
Fanny
will
surprise
us
in
the
way
she
mentions
--
very
much
*NL*
doubt
.
A
silly
girl
!
--
silly
girl
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
was
hurriedly
burst
open
again
,
and
in
came
running
Cainy
*NL*
Ball
out
of
breath
,
his
mouth
red
and
open
,
like
the
bell
of
a
penny
*NL*
trumpet
,
from
which
he
coughed
with
noisy
vigour
and
great
distension
*NL*
of
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Cain
Ball
,
''
said
Oak
,
sternly
,
``
why
will
you
run
so
fast
and
*NL*
lose
your
breath
so
?
I
'm
always
telling
you
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
I
--
a
puff
of
mee
breath

went

the

wrong
way
,
please
,
Mister
*NL*
Oak
,
and
made
me
cough
--
hok

hok

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
what
have
you
come
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
run
to
tell
ye
,
''
said
the
junior
shepherd
,
supporting
his
*NL*
exhausted
youthful
frame
against
the
doorpost
,
``
that
you
must
come
*NL*
directly
.
Two
more
ewes
have
twinned

that
's
what
's
the
matter
,
*NL*
Shepherd
Oak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
it
,
''
said
Oak
,
jumping
up
,
and
dimissing
for
the
present
*NL*
his
thoughts
on
poor
Fanny
.
``
You
are
a
good
boy
to
run
and
tell
me
,
*NL*
Cain
,
and
you
shall
smell
a
large
plum
pudding
some
day
as
a
treat
.
*NL*
But
,
before
we
go
,
Cainy
,
bring
the
tarpot
,
and
we
'll
mark
this
lot
*NL*
and
have
done
with
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
took
from
his
illimitable
pockets
a
marking
iron
,
dipped
it
*NL*
into
the
pot
,
and
imprinted
on
the
buttocks
of
the
infant
sheep
the
*NL*
initials
of
her
he
delighted
to
muse
on
--
``
B.
E.
,
''
which
signified
to
*NL*
all
the
region
round
that
henceforth
the
lambs
belonged
to
Farmer
*NL*
Bathsheba
Everdene
,
and
to
no
one
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Cainy
,
shoulder
your
two
,
and
off
.
Good
morning
,
Mr.
Boldwood
.
''
*NL*
The
shepherd
lifted
the
sixteen
large
legs
and
four
small
bodies
he
*NL*
had
himself
brought
,
and
vanished
with
them
in
the
direction
of
the
*NL*
lambing
field
hard
by
--
their
frames
being
now
in
a
sleek
and
hopeful
*NL*
state
,
pleasantly
contrasting
with
their
death
's
-
door
plight
of
half
*NL*
an
hour
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
followed
him
a
little
way
up
the
field
,
hesitated
,
and
*NL*
turned
back
.
He
followed
him
again
with
a
last
resolve
,
annihilating
*NL*
return
.
On
approaching
the
nook
in
which
the
fold
was
constructed
,
*NL*
the
farmer
drew
out
his
pocket-book
,
unfastened
it
,
and
allowed
it
to
*NL*
lie
open
on
his
hand
.
A
letter
was
revealed
--
Bathsheba
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
going
to
ask
you
,
Oak
,
''
he
said
,
with
unreal
carelessness
,
``
if
*NL*
you
know
whose
writing
this
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
glanced
into
the
book
,
and
replied
instantly
,
with
a
flushed
*NL*
face
,
``
Miss
Everdene
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
had
coloured
simply
at
the
consciousness
of
sounding
her
name
.
*NL*
He
now
felt
a
strangely
distressing
qualm
from
a
new
thought
.
The
*NL*
letter
could
of
course
be
no
other
than
anonymous
,
or
the
inquiry
*NL*
would
not
have
been
necessary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
mistook
his
confusion
:
sensitive
persons
are
always
ready
*NL*
with
their
``
Is
it
I
?
''
in
preference
to
objective
reasoning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
question
was
perfectly
fair
,
''
he
returned
--
and
there
was
*NL*
something
incongruous
in
the
serious
earnestness
with
which
he
*NL*
applied
himself
to
an
argument
on
a
valentine
.
``
You
know
it
is
*NL*
always
expected
that
privy
inquiries
will
be
made
:
that
's
where
*NL*
the
--
fun
lies
.
''
If
the
word
``
fun
''
had
been
``
torture
,
''
it
could
not
*NL*
have
been
uttered
with
a
more
constrained
and
restless
countenance
*NL*
than
was
Boldwood
's
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
parting
from
Gabriel
,
the
lonely
and
reserved
man
returned
to
*NL*
his
house
to
breakfast
--
feeling
twinges
of
shame
and
regret
at
having
*NL*
so
far
exposed
his
mood
by
those
fevered
questions
to
a
stranger
.
He
*NL*
again
placed
the
letter
on
the
mantelpiece
,
and
sat
down
to
think
of
*NL*
the
circumstances
attending
it
by
the
light
of
Gabriel
's
information
.

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
SAINTS
'
AND
ALL
SOULS
'
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
week-day
morning
a
small
congregation
,
consisting
mainly
of
*NL*
women
and
girls
,
rose
from
its
knees
in
the
mouldy
nave
of
a
church
*NL*
called
All
Saints
'
,
in
the
distant
barrack-town
before-mentioned
,
at
*NL*
the
end
of
a
service
without
a
sermon
.
They
were
about
to
disperse
,
*NL*
when
a
smart
footstep
,
entering
the
porch
and
coming
up
the
central
*NL*
passage
,
arrested
their
attention
.
The
step
echoed
with
a
ring
*NL*
unusual
in
a
church
;
it
was
the
clink
of
spurs
.
Everybody
looked
.
A
*NL*
young
cavalry
soldier
in
a
red
uniform
,
with
the
three
chevrons
of
a
*NL*
sergeant
upon
his
sleeve
,
strode
up
the
aisle
,
with
an
embarrassment
*NL*
which
was
only
the
more
marked
by
the
intense
vigour
of
his
step
,
and
*NL*
by
the
determination
upon
his
face
to
show
none
.
A
slight
flush
had
*NL*
mounted
his
cheek
by
the
time
he
had
run
the
gauntlet
between
these
*NL*
women
;
but
,
passing
on
through
the
chancel
arch
,
he
never
paused
till
*NL*
he
came
close
to
the
altar
railing
.
Here
for
a
moment
he
stood
*NL*
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officiating
curate
,
who
had
not
yet
doffed
his
surplice
,
*NL*
perceived
the
new-comer
,
and
followed
him
to
the
communion-space
.
He
*NL*
whispered
to
the
soldier
,
and
then
beckoned
to
the
clerk
,
who
in
his
*NL*
turn
whispered
to
an
elderly
woman
,
apparently
his
wife
,
and
they
*NL*
also
went
up
the
chancel
steps
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
wedding
!
''
murmured
some
of
the
women
,
brightening
.
``
Let
's
*NL*
wait
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
majority
again
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
creaking
of
machinery
behind
,
and
some
of
the
young
ones
*NL*
turned
their
heads
.
From
the
interior
face
of
the
west
wall
of
the
*NL*
tower
projected
a
little
canopy
with
a
quarter-jack
and
small
bell
*NL*
beneath
it
,
the
automaton
being
driven
by
the
same
clock
machinery
*NL*
that
struck
the
large
bell
in
the
tower
.
Between
the
tower
and
the
*NL*
church
was
a
close
screen
,
the
door
of
which
was
kept
shut
during
*NL*
services
,
hiding
this
grotesque
clockwork
from
sight
.
At
present
,
*NL*
however
,
the
door
was
open
,
and
the
egress
of
the
jack
,
the
blows
on
*NL*
the
bell
,
and
the
mannikin
's
retreat
into
the
nook
again
,
were
*NL*
visible
to
many
,
and
audible
throughout
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
jack
had
struck
half-past
eleven
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
woman
?
''
whispered
some
of
the
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
sergeant
stood
still
with
the
abnormal
rigidity
of
the
old
*NL*
pillars
around
.
He
faced
the
south-east
,
and
was
as
silent
as
he
was
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
silence
grew
to
be
a
noticeable
thing
as
the
minutes
went
on
,
*NL*
and
nobody
else
appeared
,
and
not
a
soul
moved
.
The
rattle
of
the
*NL*
quarter-jack
again
from
its
niche
,
its
blows
for
three-quarters
,
its
*NL*
fussy
retreat
,
were
almost
painfully
abrupt
,
and
caused
many
of
the
*NL*
congregation
to
start
palpably
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
where
the
woman
is
!
''
a
voice
whispered
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
began
now
that
slight
shifting
of
feet
,
that
artificial
*NL*
coughing
among
several
,
which
betrays
a
nervous
suspense
.
At
length
*NL*
there
was
a
titter
.
But
the
soldier
never
moved
.
There
he
stood
,
*NL*
his
face
to
the
south-east
,
upright
as
a
column
,
his
cap
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clock
ticked
on
.
The
women
threw
off
their
nervousness
,
and
*NL*
titters
and
giggling
became
more
frequent
.
Then
came
a
dead
silence
.
*NL*
Every
one
was
waiting
for
the
end
.
Some
persons
may
have
noticed
how
*NL*
extraordinarily
the
striking
of
quarters
seems
to
quicken
the
flight
*NL*
of
time
.
It
was
hardly
credible
that
the
jack
had
not
got
wrong
with
*NL*
the
minutes
when
the
rattle
began
again
,
the
puppet
emerged
,
and
the
*NL*
four
quarters
were
struck
fitfully
as
before
.
One
could
almost
be
*NL*
positive
that
there
was
a
malicious
leer
upon
the
hideous
creature
's
*NL*
face
,
and
a
mischievous
delight
in
its
twitchings
.
Then
followed
the
*NL*
dull
and
remote
resonance
of
the
twelve
heavy
strokes
in
the
tower
*NL*
above
.
The
women
were
impressed
,
and
there
was
no
giggle
this
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clergyman
glided
into
the
vestry
,
and
the
clerk
vanished
.
The
*NL*
sergeant
had
not
yet
turned
;
every
woman
in
the
church
was
waiting
to
*NL*
see
his
face
,
and
he
appeared
to
know
it
.
At
last
he
did
turn
,
and
*NL*
stalked
resolutely
down
the
nave
,
braving
them
all
,
with
a
compressed
*NL*
lip
.
Two
bowed
and
toothless
old
almsmen
then
looked
at
each
other
*NL*
and
chuckled
,
innocently
enough
;
but
the
sound
had
a
strange
weird
*NL*
effect
in
that
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Opposite
to
the
church
was
a
paved
square
,
around
which
several
*NL*
overhanging
wood
buildings
of
old
time
cast
a
picturesque
shade
.
The
*NL*
young
man
on
leaving
the
door
went
to
cross
the
square
,
when
,
in
the
*NL*
middle
,
he
met
a
little
woman
.
The
expression
of
her
face
,
which
had
*NL*
been
one
of
intense
anxiety
,
sank
at
the
sight
of
his
nearly
to
*NL*
terror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
he
said
,
in
a
suppressed
passion
,
fixedly
looking
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Frank
--
I
made
a
mistake
!
--
I
thought
that
church
with
the
spire
*NL*
was
All
Saints
'
,
and
I
was
at
the
door
at
half-past
eleven
to
a
*NL*
minute
as
you
said
.
I
waited
till
a
quarter
to
twelve
,
and
found
*NL*
then
that
I
was
in
All
Souls
'
.
But
I
was
n't
much
frightened
,
for
*NL*
I
thought
it
could
be
to-morrow
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fool
,
for
so
fooling
me
!
But
say
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
it
be
to-morrow
,
Frank
?
''
she
asked
blankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To-morrow
!
''
and
he
gave
vent
to
a
hoarse
laugh
.
``
I
do
n't
go
through
*NL*
that
experience
again
for
some
time
,
I
warrant
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
after
all
,
''
she
expostulated
in
a
trembling
voice
,
``
the
mistake
*NL*
was
not
such
a
terrible
thing
!
Now
,
dear
Frank
,
when
shall
it
be
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
when
?
God
knows
!
''
he
said
,
with
a
light
irony
,
and
turning
from
*NL*
her
walked
rapidly
away
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
MARKET-PLACE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
Saturday
Boldwood
was
in
Casterbridge
market
house
as
usual
,
when
*NL*
the
disturber
of
his
dreams
entered
and
became
visible
to
him
.
Adam
*NL*
had
awakened
from
his
deep
sleep
,
and
behold
!
there
was
Eve
.
The
*NL*
farmer
took
courage
,
and
for
the
first
time
really
looked
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Material
causes
and
emotional
effects
are
not
to
be
arranged
in
*NL*
regular
equation
.
The
result
from
capital
employed
in
the
production
*NL*
of
any
movement
of
a
mental
nature
is
sometimes
as
tremendous
as
the
*NL*
cause
itself
is
absurdly
minute
.
When
women
are
in
a
freakish
mood
,
*NL*
their
usual
intuition
,
either
from
carelessness
or
inherent
defect
,
*NL*
seemingly
fails
to
teach
them
this
,
and
hence
it
was
that
Bathsheba
*NL*
was
fated
to
be
astonished
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
looked
at
her
--
not
slily
,
critically
,
or
understandingly
,
*NL*
but
blankly
at
gaze
,
in
the
way
a
reaper
looks
up
at
a
passing
*NL*
train
--
as
something
foreign
to
his
element
,
and
but
dimly
understood
.
*NL*
To
Boldwood
women
had
been
remote
phenomena
rather
than
necessary
*NL*
complements
--
comets
of
such
uncertain
aspect
,
movement
,
and
*NL*
permanence
,
that
whether
their
orbits
were
as
geometrical
,
*NL*
unchangeable
,
and
as
subject
to
laws
as
his
own
,
or
as
absolutely
*NL*
erratic
as
they
superficially
appeared
,
he
had
not
deemed
it
his
duty
*NL*
to
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
black
hair
,
her
correct
facial
curves
and
profile
,
and
*NL*
the
roundness
of
her
chin
and
throat
.
He
saw
then
the
side
of
her
*NL*
eyelids
,
eyes
,
and
lashes
,
and
the
shape
of
her
ear
.
Next
he
noticed
*NL*
her
figure
,
her
skirt
,
and
the
very
soles
of
her
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
thought
her
beautiful
,
but
wondered
whether
he
was
right
in
*NL*
his
thought
,
for
it
seemed
impossible
that
this
romance
in
the
flesh
,
*NL*
if
so
sweet
as
he
imagined
,
could
have
been
going
on
long
without
*NL*
creating
a
commotion
of
delight
among
men
,
and
provoking
more
inquiry
*NL*
than
Bathsheba
had
done
,
even
though
that
was
not
a
little
.
To
the
*NL*
best
of
his
judgement
neither
nature
nor
art
could
improve
this
*NL*
perfect
one
of
an
imperfect
many
.
His
heart
began
to
move
within
*NL*
him
.
Boldwood
,
it
must
be
remembered
,
though
forty
years
of
age
,
had
*NL*
never
before
inspected
a
woman
with
the
very
centre
and
force
of
his
*NL*
glance
;
they
had
struck
upon
all
his
senses
at
wide
angles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
she
really
beautiful
?
He
could
not
assure
himself
that
his
*NL*
opinion
was
true
even
now
.
He
furtively
said
to
a
neighbour
,
``
Is
*NL*
Miss
Everdene
considered
handsome
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
;
she
was
a
good
deal
noticed
the
first
time
she
came
,
if
you
*NL*
remember
.
A
very
handsome
girl
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
is
never
more
credulous
than
in
receiving
favourable
opinions
*NL*
on
the
beauty
of
a
woman
he
is
half
,
or
quite
,
in
love
with
;
a
mere
*NL*
child
's
word
on
the
point
has
the
weight
of
an
R.A.
's
.
Boldwood
was
*NL*
satisfied
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
this
charming
woman
had
in
effect
said
to
him
,
``
Marry
me
.
''
Why
*NL*
should
she
have
done
that
strange
thing
?
Boldwood
's
blindness
to
*NL*
the
difference
between
approving
of
what
circumstances
suggest
,
and
*NL*
originating
what
they
do
not
suggest
,
was
well
matched
by
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
insensibility
to
the
possibly
great
issues
of
little
beginnings
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
this
moment
coolly
dealing
with
a
dashing
young
farmer
,
*NL*
adding
up
accounts
with
him
as
indifferently
as
if
his
face
had
been
*NL*
the
pages
of
a
ledger
.
It
was
evident
that
such
a
nature
as
his
had
*NL*
no
attraction
for
a
woman
of
Bathsheba
's
taste
.
But
Boldwood
grew
*NL*
hot
down
to
his
hands
with
an
incipient
jealousy
;
he
trod
for
the
*NL*
first
time
the
threshold
of
``
the
injured
lover
's
hell
.
''
His
first
*NL*
impulse
was
to
go
and
thrust
himself
between
them
.
This
could
be
*NL*
done
,
but
only
in
one
way
--
by
asking
to
see
a
sample
of
her
corn
.
*NL*
Boldwood
renounced
the
idea
.
He
could
not
make
the
request
;
it
was
*NL*
debasing
loveliness
to
ask
it
to
buy
and
sell
,
and
jarred
with
his
*NL*
conceptions
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
time
Bathsheba
was
conscious
of
having
broken
into
that
*NL*
dignified
stronghold
at
last
.
His
eyes
,
she
knew
,
were
following
her
*NL*
everywhere
.
This
was
a
triumph
;
and
had
it
come
naturally
,
such
a
*NL*
triumph
would
have
been
the
sweeter
to
her
for
this
piquing
delay
.
*NL*
But
it
had
been
brought
about
by
misdirected
ingenuity
,
and
she
*NL*
valued
it
only
as
she
valued
an
artificial
flower
or
a
wax
fruit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
a
woman
with
some
good
sense
in
reasoning
on
subjects
wherein
*NL*
her
heart
was
not
involved
,
Bathsheba
genuinely
repented
that
a
freak
*NL*
which
had
owed
its
existence
as
much
to
Liddy
as
to
herself
,
should
*NL*
ever
have
been
undertaken
,
to
disturb
the
placidity
of
a
man
she
*NL*
respected
too
highly
to
deliberately
tease
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
that
day
nearly
formed
the
intention
of
begging
his
pardon
on
*NL*
the
very
next
occasion
of
their
meeting
.
The
worst
features
of
this
*NL*
arrangement
were
that
,
if
he
thought
she
ridiculed
him
,
an
apology
*NL*
would
increase
the
offence
by
being
disbelieved
;
and
if
he
thought
*NL*
she
wanted
him
to
woo
her
,
it
would
read
like
additional
evidence
of
*NL*
her
forwardness
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BOLDWOOD
IN
MEDITATION
--
REGRET
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
was
tenant
of
what
was
called
Little
Weatherbury
Farm
,
and
*NL*
his
person
was
the
nearest
approach
to
aristocracy
that
this
remoter
*NL*
quarter
of
the
parish
could
boast
of
.
Genteel
strangers
,
whose
god
*NL*
was
their
town
,
who
might
happen
to
be
compelled
to
linger
about
this
*NL*
nook
for
a
day
,
heard
the
sound
of
light
wheels
,
and
prayed
to
see
*NL*
good
society
,
to
the
degree
of
a
solitary
lord
,
or
squire
at
the
very
*NL*
least
,
but
it
was
only
Mr.
Boldwood
going
out
for
the
day
.
They
*NL*
heard
the
sound
of
wheels
yet
once
more
,
and
were
re-animated
to
*NL*
expectancy
:
it
was
only
Mr.
Boldwood
coming
home
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
house
stood
recessed
from
the
road
,
and
the
stables
,
which
are
*NL*
to
a
farm
what
a
fireplace
is
to
a
room
,
were
behind
,
their
lower
*NL*
portions
being
lost
amid
bushes
of
laurel
.
Inside
the
blue
door
,
*NL*
open
half-way
down
,
were
to
be
seen
at
this
time
the
backs
and
tails
*NL*
of
half-a-dozen
warm
and
contented
horses
standing
in
their
stalls
;
*NL*
and
as
thus
viewed
,
they
presented
alternations
of
roan
and
bay
,
*NL*
in
shapes
like
a
Moorish
arch
,
the
tail
being
a
streak
down
the
*NL*
midst
of
each
.
Over
these
,
and
lost
to
the
eye
gazing
in
from
the
*NL*
outer
light
,
the
mouths
of
the
same
animals
could
be
heard
busily
*NL*
sustaining
the
above-named
warmth
and
plumpness
by
quantities
of
oats
*NL*
and
hay
.
The
restless
and
shadowy
figure
of
a
colt
wandered
about
a
*NL*
loose-box
at
the
end
,
whilst
the
steady
grind
of
all
the
eaters
was
*NL*
occasionally
diversified
by
the
rattle
of
a
rope
or
the
stamp
of
a
*NL*
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pacing
up
and
down
at
the
heels
of
the
animals
was
Farmer
Boldwood
*NL*
himself
.
This
place
was
his
almonry
and
cloister
in
one
:
here
,
after
*NL*
looking
to
the
feeding
of
his
four-footed
dependants
,
the
celibate
*NL*
would
walk
and
meditate
of
an
evening
till
the
moon
's
rays
streamed
*NL*
in
through
the
cobwebbed
windows
,
or
total
darkness
enveloped
the
*NL*
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
square-framed
perpendicularity
showed
more
fully
now
than
in
the
*NL*
crowd
and
bustle
of
the
market-house
.
In
this
meditative
walk
his
*NL*
foot
met
the
floor
with
heel
and
toe
simultaneously
,
and
his
fine
*NL*
reddish-fleshed
face
was
bent
downwards
just
enough
to
render
obscure
*NL*
the
still
mouth
and
the
well-rounded
though
rather
prominent
and
*NL*
broad
chin
.
A
few
clear
and
thread-like
horizontal
lines
were
the
*NL*
only
interruption
to
the
otherwise
smooth
surface
of
his
large
*NL*
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
phases
of
Boldwood
's
life
were
ordinary
enough
,
but
his
was
not
*NL*
an
ordinary
nature
.
That
stillness
,
which
struck
casual
observers
*NL*
more
than
anything
else
in
his
character
and
habit
,
and
seemed
so
*NL*
precisely
like
the
rest
of
inanition
,
may
have
been
the
perfect
*NL*
balance
of
enormous
antagonistic
forces
--
positives
and
negatives
in
*NL*
fine
adjustment
.
His
equilibrium
disturbed
,
he
was
in
extremity
at
*NL*
once
.
If
an
emotion
possessed
him
at
all
,
it
ruled
him
;
a
feeling
*NL*
not
mastering
him
was
entirely
latent
.
Stagnant
or
rapid
,
it
was
*NL*
never
slow
.
He
was
always
hit
mortally
,
or
he
was
missed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
no
light
and
careless
touches
in
his
constitution
,
either
*NL*
for
good
or
for
evil
.
Stern
in
the
outlines
of
action
,
mild
in
the
*NL*
details
,
he
was
serious
throughout
all
.
He
saw
no
absurd
sides
to
*NL*
the
follies
of
life
,
and
thus
,
though
not
quite
companionable
in
the
*NL*
eyes
of
merry
men
and
scoffers
,
and
those
to
whom
all
things
show
*NL*
life
as
a
jest
,
he
was
not
intolerable
to
the
earnest
and
those
*NL*
acquainted
with
grief
.
Being
a
man
who
read
all
the
dramas
of
life
*NL*
seriously
,
if
he
failed
to
please
when
they
were
comedies
,
there
was
*NL*
no
frivolous
treatment
to
reproach
him
for
when
they
chanced
to
end
*NL*
tragically
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
far
from
dreaming
that
the
dark
and
silent
shape
upon
*NL*
which
she
had
so
carelessly
thrown
a
seed
was
a
hotbed
of
tropic
*NL*
intensity
.
Had
she
known
Boldwood
's
moods
,
her
blame
would
have
*NL*
been
fearful
,
and
the
stain
upon
her
heart
ineradicable
.
Moreover
,
*NL*
had
she
known
her
present
power
for
good
or
evil
over
this
man
,
she
*NL*
would
have
trembled
at
her
responsibility
.
Luckily
for
her
present
,
*NL*
unluckily
for
her
future
tranquillity
,
her
understanding
had
not
yet
*NL*
told
her
what
Boldwood
was
.
Nobody
knew
entirely
;
for
though
it
was
*NL*
possible
to
form
guesses
concerning
his
wild
capabilities
from
old
*NL*
floodmarks
faintly
visible
,
he
had
never
been
seen
at
the
high
tides
*NL*
which
caused
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farmer
Boldwood
came
to
the
stable-door
and
looked
forth
across
the
*NL*
level
fields
.
Beyond
the
first
enclosure
was
a
hedge
,
and
on
the
*NL*
other
side
of
this
a
meadow
belonging
to
Bathsheba
's
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
early
spring
--
the
time
of
going
to
grass
with
the
sheep
,
*NL*
when
they
have
the
first
feed
of
the
meadows
,
before
these
are
laid
*NL*
up
for
mowing
.
The
wind
,
which
had
been
blowing
east
for
several
*NL*
weeks
,
had
veered
to
the
southward
,
and
the
middle
of
spring
had
come
*NL*
abruptly
--
almost
without
a
beginning
.
It
was
that
period
in
the
*NL*
vernal
quarter
when
we
may
suppose
the
Dryads
to
be
waking
for
the
*NL*
season
.
The
vegetable
world
begins
to
move
and
swell
and
the
saps
to
*NL*
rise
,
till
in
the
completest
silence
of
lone
gardens
and
trackless
*NL*
plantations
,
where
everything
seems
helpless
and
still
after
the
*NL*
bond
and
slavery
of
frost
,
there
are
bustlings
,
strainings
,
united
*NL*
thrusts
,
and
pulls-all-together
,
in
comparison
with
which
the
*NL*
powerful
tugs
of
cranes
and
pulleys
in
a
noisy
city
are
but
pigmy
*NL*
efforts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
,
looking
into
the
distant
meadows
,
saw
there
three
figures
.
*NL*
They
were
those
of
Miss
Everdene
,
Shepherd
Oak
,
and
Cainy
Ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Bathsheba
's
figure
shone
upon
the
farmer
's
eyes
it
lighted
him
*NL*
up
as
the
moon
lights
up
a
great
tower
.
A
man
's
body
is
as
the
*NL*
shell
,
or
the
tablet
,
of
his
soul
,
as
he
is
reserved
or
ingenuous
,
*NL*
overflowing
or
self-contained
.
There
was
a
change
in
Boldwood
's
*NL*
exterior
from
its
former
impassibleness
;
and
his
face
showed
that
he
*NL*
was
now
living
outside
his
defences
for
the
first
time
,
and
with
a
*NL*
fearful
sense
of
exposure
.
It
is
the
usual
experience
of
strong
*NL*
natures
when
they
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
arrived
at
a
conclusion
.
It
was
to
go
across
and
inquire
*NL*
boldly
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
insulation
of
his
heart
by
reserve
during
these
many
years
,
*NL*
without
a
channel
of
any
kind
for
disposable
emotion
,
had
worked
its
*NL*
effect
.
It
has
been
observed
more
than
once
that
the
causes
of
love
*NL*
are
chiefly
subjective
,
and
Boldwood
was
a
living
testimony
to
the
*NL*
truth
of
the
proposition
.
No
mother
existed
to
absorb
his
devotion
,
*NL*
no
sister
for
his
tenderness
,
no
idle
ties
for
sense
.
He
became
*NL*
surcharged
with
the
compound
,
which
was
genuine
lover
's
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
approached
the
gate
of
the
meadow
.
Beyond
it
the
ground
was
*NL*
melodious
with
ripples
,
and
the
sky
with
larks
;
the
low
bleating
of
*NL*
the
flock
mingling
with
both
.
Mistress
and
man
were
engaged
in
the
*NL*
operation
of
making
a
lamb
``
take
,
''
which
is
performed
whenever
an
ewe
*NL*
has
lost
her
own
offspring
,
one
of
the
twins
of
another
ewe
being
*NL*
given
her
as
a
substitute
.
Gabriel
had
skinned
the
dead
lamb
,
and
*NL*
was
tying
the
skin
over
the
body
of
the
live
lamb
,
in
the
customary
*NL*
manner
,
whilst
Bathsheba
was
holding
open
a
little
pen
of
four
*NL*
hurdles
,
into
which
the
Mother
and
foisted
lamb
were
driven
,
where
*NL*
they
would
remain
till
the
old
sheep
conceived
an
affection
for
the
*NL*
young
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
looked
up
at
the
completion
of
the
manoeuvre
and
saw
the
*NL*
farmer
by
the
gate
,
where
he
was
overhung
by
a
willow
tree
in
full
*NL*
bloom
.
Gabriel
,
to
whom
her
face
was
as
the
uncertain
glory
of
an
*NL*
April
day
,
was
ever
regardful
of
its
faintest
changes
,
and
instantly
*NL*
discerned
thereon
the
mark
of
some
influence
from
without
,
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
keenly
self-conscious
reddening
.
He
also
turned
and
beheld
*NL*
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
connecting
these
signs
with
the
letter
Boldwood
had
shown
*NL*
him
,
Gabriel
suspected
her
of
some
coquettish
procedure
begun
by
that
*NL*
means
,
and
carried
on
since
,
he
knew
not
how
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farmer
Boldwood
had
read
the
pantomime
denoting
that
they
were
aware
*NL*
of
his
presence
,
and
the
perception
was
as
too
much
light
turned
upon
*NL*
his
new
sensibility
.
He
was
still
in
the
road
,
and
by
moving
on
he
*NL*
hoped
that
neither
would
recognize
that
he
had
originally
intended
*NL*
to
enter
the
field
.
He
passed
by
with
an
utter
and
overwhelming
*NL*
sensation
of
ignorance
,
shyness
,
and
doubt
.
Perhaps
in
her
manner
*NL*
there
were
signs
that
she
wished
to
see
him
--
perhaps
not
--
he
could
*NL*
not
read
a
woman
.
The
cabala
of
this
erotic
philosophy
seemed
to
*NL*
consist
of
the
subtlest
meanings
expressed
in
misleading
ways
.
Every
*NL*
turn
,
look
,
word
,
and
accent
contained
a
mystery
quite
distinct
from
*NL*
its
obvious
import
,
and
not
one
had
ever
been
pondered
by
him
until
*NL*
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
Bathsheba
,
she
was
not
deceived
into
the
belief
that
Farmer
*NL*
Boldwood
had
walked
by
on
business
or
in
idleness
.
She
collected
*NL*
the
probabilities
of
the
case
,
and
concluded
that
she
was
herself
*NL*
responsible
for
Boldwood
's
appearance
there
.
It
troubled
her
much
*NL*
to
see
what
a
great
flame
a
little
wildfire
was
likely
to
kindle
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
no
schemer
for
marriage
,
nor
was
she
deliberately
a
*NL*
trifler
with
the
affections
of
men
,
and
a
censor
's
experience
on
*NL*
seeing
an
actual
flirt
after
observing
her
would
have
been
a
feeling
*NL*
of
surprise
that
Bathsheba
could
be
so
different
from
such
a
one
,
*NL*
and
yet
so
like
what
a
flirt
is
supposed
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
resolved
never
again
,
by
look
or
by
sign
,
to
interrupt
the
steady
*NL*
flow
of
this
man
's
life
.
But
a
resolution
to
avoid
an
evil
is
*NL*
seldom
framed
till
the
evil
is
so
far
advanced
as
to
make
avoidance
*NL*
impossible
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SHEEP-WASHING
--
THE
OFFER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
did
eventually
call
upon
her
.
She
was
not
at
home
.
``
Of
*NL*
course
not
,
''
he
murmured
.
In
contemplating
Bathsheba
as
a
woman
,
he
*NL*
had
forgotten
the
accidents
of
her
position
as
an
agriculturist
--
that
*NL*
being
as
much
of
a
farmer
,
and
as
extensive
a
farmer
,
as
himself
,
*NL*
her
probable
whereabouts
was
out-of-doors
at
this
time
of
the
year
.
*NL*
This
,
and
the
other
oversights
Boldwood
was
guilty
of
,
were
natural
*NL*
to
the
mood
,
and
still
more
natural
to
the
circumstances
.
The
*NL*
great
aids
to
idealization
in
love
were
present
here
:
occasional
*NL*
observation
of
her
from
a
distance
,
and
the
absence
of
social
*NL*
intercourse
with
her
--
visual
familiarity
,
oral
strangeness
.
The
*NL*
smaller
human
elements
were
kept
out
of
sight
;
the
pettinesses
that
*NL*
enter
so
largely
into
all
earthly
living
and
doing
were
disguised
by
*NL*
the
accident
of
lover
and
loved-one
not
being
on
visiting
terms
;
and
*NL*
there
was
hardly
awakened
a
thought
in
Boldwood
that
sorry
household
*NL*
realities
appertained
to
her
,
or
that
she
,
like
all
others
,
had
*NL*
moments
of
commonplace
,
when
to
be
least
plainly
seen
was
to
be
most
*NL*
prettily
remembered
.
Thus
a
mild
sort
of
apotheosis
took
place
*NL*
in
his
fancy
,
whilst
she
still
lived
and
breathed
within
his
own
*NL*
horizon
,
a
troubled
creature
like
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
end
of
May
when
the
farmer
determined
to
be
no
longer
*NL*
repulsed
by
trivialities
or
distracted
by
suspense
.
He
had
by
this
*NL*
time
grown
used
to
being
in
love
;
the
passion
now
startled
him
less
*NL*
even
when
it
tortured
him
more
,
and
he
felt
himself
adequate
to
the
*NL*
situation
.
On
inquiring
for
her
at
her
house
they
had
told
him
she
*NL*
was
at
the
sheep-washing
,
and
he
went
off
to
seek
her
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sheep-washing
pool
was
a
perfectly
circular
basin
of
brickwork
in
*NL*
the
meadows
,
full
of
the
clearest
water
.
To
birds
on
the
wing
its
*NL*
glassy
surface
,
reflecting
the
light
sky
,
must
have
been
visible
for
*NL*
miles
around
as
a
glistening
Cyclops
'
eye
in
a
green
face
.
The
grass
*NL*
about
the
margin
at
this
season
was
a
sight
to
remember
long
--
in
a
*NL*
minor
sort
of
way
.
Its
activity
in
sucking
the
moisture
from
the
*NL*
rich
damp
sod
was
almost
a
process
observable
by
the
eye
.
The
*NL*
outskirts
of
this
level
water-meadow
were
diversified
by
rounded
and
*NL*
hollow
pastures
,
where
just
now
every
flower
that
was
not
a
buttercup
*NL*
was
a
daisy
.
The
river
slid
along
noiselessly
as
a
shade
,
the
*NL*
swelling
reeds
and
sedge
forming
a
flexible
palisade
upon
its
moist
*NL*
brink
.
To
the
north
of
the
mead
were
trees
,
the
leaves
of
which
*NL*
were
new
,
soft
,
and
moist
,
not
yet
having
stiffened
and
darkened
*NL*
under
summer
sun
and
drought
,
their
colour
being
yellow
beside
a
*NL*
green
--
green
beside
a
yellow
.
From
the
recesses
of
this
knot
of
*NL*
foliage
the
loud
notes
of
three
cuckoos
were
resounding
through
the
*NL*
still
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
went
meditating
down
the
slopes
with
his
eyes
on
his
boots
,
*NL*
which
the
yellow
pollen
from
the
buttercups
had
bronzed
in
artistic
*NL*
gradations
.
A
tributary
of
the
main
stream
flowed
through
the
*NL*
basin
of
the
pool
by
an
inlet
and
outlet
at
opposite
points
of
its
*NL*
diameter
.
Shepherd
Oak
,
Jan
Coggan
,
Moon
,
Poorgrass
,
Cain
Ball
,
*NL*
and
several
others
were
assembled
here
,
all
dripping
wet
to
the
*NL*
very
roots
of
their
hair
,
and
Bathsheba
was
standing
by
in
a
new
*NL*
riding-habit
--
the
most
elegant
she
had
ever
worn
--
the
reins
of
her
*NL*
horse
being
looped
over
her
arm
.
Flagons
of
cider
were
rolling
about
*NL*
upon
the
green
.
The
meek
sheep
were
pushed
into
the
pool
by
Coggan
*NL*
and
Matthew
Moon
,
who
stood
by
the
lower
hatch
,
immersed
to
their
*NL*
waists
;
then
Gabriel
,
who
stood
on
the
brink
,
thrust
them
under
as
*NL*
they
swam
along
,
with
an
instrument
like
a
crutch
,
formed
for
the
*NL*
purpose
,
and
also
for
assisting
the
exhausted
animals
when
the
wool
*NL*
became
saturated
and
they
began
to
sink
.
They
were
let
out
against
*NL*
the
stream
,
and
through
the
upper
opening
,
all
impurities
flowing
*NL*
away
below
.
Cainy
Ball
and
Joseph
,
who
performed
this
latter
*NL*
operation
,
were
if
possible
wetter
than
the
rest
;
they
resembled
*NL*
dolphins
under
a
fountain
,
every
protuberance
and
angle
of
their
*NL*
clothes
dribbling
forth
a
small
rill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
came
close
and
bade
her
good
morning
,
with
such
constraint
*NL*
that
she
could
not
but
think
he
had
stepped
across
to
the
washing
for
*NL*
its
own
sake
,
hoping
not
to
find
her
there
;
more
,
she
fancied
his
*NL*
brow
severe
and
his
eye
slighting
.
Bathsheba
immediately
contrived
*NL*
to
withdraw
,
and
glided
along
by
the
river
till
she
was
a
stone
's
*NL*
throw
off
.
She
heard
footsteps
brushing
the
grass
,
and
had
a
*NL*
consciousness
that
love
was
encircling
her
like
a
perfume
.
Instead
*NL*
of
turning
or
waiting
,
Bathsheba
went
further
among
the
high
sedges
,
*NL*
but
Boldwood
seemed
determined
,
and
pressed
on
till
they
were
*NL*
completely
past
the
bend
of
the
river
.
Here
,
without
being
seen
,
*NL*
they
could
hear
the
splashing
and
shouts
of
the
washers
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Everdene
!
''
said
the
farmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
trembled
,
turned
,
and
said
``
Good
morning
.
''
His
tone
was
so
*NL*
utterly
removed
from
all
she
had
expected
as
a
beginning
.
It
was
*NL*
lowness
and
quiet
accentuated
:
an
emphasis
of
deep
meanings
,
their
*NL*
form
,
at
the
same
time
,
being
scarcely
expressed
.
Silence
has
*NL*
sometimes
a
remarkable
power
of
showing
itself
as
the
disembodied
*NL*
soul
of
feeling
wandering
without
its
carcase
,
and
it
is
then
more
*NL*
impressive
than
speech
.
In
the
same
way
,
to
say
a
little
is
often
to
*NL*
tell
more
than
to
say
a
great
deal
.
Boldwood
told
everything
in
that
*NL*
word
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
consciousness
expands
on
learning
that
what
was
fancied
to
*NL*
be
the
rumble
of
wheels
is
the
reverberation
of
thunder
,
so
did
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
at
her
intuitive
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
--
almost
too
much
--
to
think
,
''
he
said
,
with
a
solemn
*NL*
simplicity
.
``
I
have
come
to
speak
to
you
without
preface
.
My
life
*NL*
is
not
my
own
since
I
have
beheld
you
clearly
,
Miss
Everdene
--
I
come
*NL*
to
make
you
an
offer
of
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
tried
to
preserve
an
absolutely
neutral
countenance
,
and
*NL*
all
the
motion
she
made
was
that
of
closing
lips
which
had
previously
*NL*
been
a
little
parted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
now
forty-one
years
old
,
''
he
went
on
.
``
I
may
have
been
called
*NL*
a
confirmed
bachelor
,
and
I
was
a
confirmed
bachelor
.
I
had
never
*NL*
any
views
of
myself
as
a
husband
in
my
earlier
days
,
nor
have
I
made
*NL*
any
calculation
on
the
subject
since
I
have
been
older
.
But
we
all
*NL*
change
,
and
my
change
,
in
this
matter
,
came
with
seeing
you
.
I
have
*NL*
felt
lately
,
more
and
more
,
that
my
present
way
of
living
is
bad
in
*NL*
every
respect
.
Beyond
all

she
*NL*
stammered
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
giving
back
of
dignity
for
dignity
seemed
to
open
the
sluices
of
*NL*
feeling
that
Boldwood
had
as
yet
kept
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
life
is
a
burden
without

he
exclaimed
,
in
a
low
voice

``

you

let
me
say
I
love
you
again

*NL*
Bathsheba
answered
nothing
,
and
the
horse
upon
her
arm
seemed
so
*NL*
impressed
that
instead
of
cropping
the
herbage
she
looked
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
and
hope
you
care
enough
for
me
to
listen
to
what
I
have
to
*NL*
tell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
momentary
impulse
at
hearing
this
was
to
ask
why
he
*NL*
thought
that
,
till
she
remembered
that
,
far
from
being
a
conceited
*NL*
assumption
on
Boldwood
's
part
,
it
was
but
the
natural
conclusion
of
*NL*
serious
reflection
based
on
deceptive
premises
of
her
own
offering
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
say
courteous
flatteries
to
you

''
the
farmer
*NL*
continued
in
an
easier
tone
,
``
and
put
my
rugged
feeling
into
a
*NL*
graceful
shape

I
have
neither
power
nor
patience

learn
such
*NL*
things

I
want
you
for
my
wife

so
wildly
that
no
other
feeling
can
*NL*
abide
in
me

I
should
not

spoken
out

I
not
been
led
to
*NL*
hope

*NL*
*NL*
``
The

she
said
to
herself

*NL*
not
a

him

*NL*

No

something

that
it

a

of
prophetic

the

beginning
of
a

You
torture
me

it

She
allowed
a
very
small
smile
to
creep
for
the
first
*NL*
time
over
her
serious
face
in
saying
this
,
and
the
white
row
of
upper
*NL*
teeth
,
and
keenly-cut
lips
already
noticed
,
suggested
an
idea
of
*NL*
heartlessness

which
was
immediately
contradicted
by
the
pleasant
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

just

so
much
as

out

I
rather
cling

*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
heart
was
young
,
and
it
swelled
with
sympathy
for
the
*NL*
deep-natured
man
who
spoke
so
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

She
was
frightened
as
well
as
agitated
at
his

vehemence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

*NL*

said

And
then
she
turned
away

Boldwood
dropped
his
gaze
to
the
ground
,
*NL*
and
stood
long
like
a
man
who
did
not

where
he
was

Realities

then
returned
upon
him
like
the
pain
of

received
in
an

excitement

eclipses
it

he

too

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PERPLEXITY
--
GRINDING
THE
SHEARS
--
A
QUARREL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
so
disinterested
and
kind
to
offer
me
all
that
I
can
desire
,
''
*NL*
Bathsheba
mused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
Farmer
Boldwood
,
whether
by
nature
kind
or
the
reverse
to
kind
,
*NL*
did
not
exercise
kindness
,
here
.
The
rarest
offerings
of
the
purest
*NL*
loves
are
but
a
self-indulgence
,
and
no
generosity
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
not
being
the
least
in
love
with
him
,
was
eventually
able
*NL*
to
look
calmly
at
his
offer
.
It
was
one
which
many
women
of
her
own
*NL*
station
in
the
neighbourhood
,
and
not
a
few
of
higher
rank
,
would
*NL*
have
been
wild
to
accept
and
proud
to
publish
.
In
every
point
of
*NL*
view
,
ranging
from
politic
to
passionate
,
it
was
desirable
that
she
,
*NL*
a
lonely
girl
,
should
marry
,
and
marry
this
earnest
,
well-to-do
,
*NL*
and
respected
man
.
He
was
close
to
her
doors
:
his
standing
was
*NL*
sufficient
:
his
qualities
were
even
supererogatory
.
Had
she
felt
,
*NL*
which
she
did
not
,
any
wish
whatever
for
the
married
state
in
the
*NL*
abstract
,
she
could
not
reasonably
have
rejected
him
,
being
a
woman
*NL*
who
frequently
appealed
to
her
understanding
for
deliverance
from
*NL*
her
whims
.
Boldwood
as
a
means
to
marriage
was
unexceptionable
:
she
*NL*
esteemed
and
liked
him
,
yet
she
did
not
want
him
.
It
appears
that
*NL*
ordinary
men
take
wives
because
possession
is
not
possible
without
*NL*
marriage
,
and
that
ordinary
women
accept
husbands
because
marriage
*NL*
is
not
possible
without
possession
;
with
totally
differing
aims
the
*NL*
method
is
the
same
on
both
sides
.
But
the
understood
incentive
on
*NL*
the
woman
's
part
was
wanting
here
.
Besides
,
Bathsheba
's
position
*NL*
as
absolute
mistress
of
a
farm
and
house
was
a
novel
one
,
and
the
*NL*
novelty
had
not
yet
begun
to
wear
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
disquiet
filled
her
which
was
somewhat
to
her
credit
,
for
it
*NL*
would
have
affected
few
.
Beyond
the
mentioned
reasons
with
which
*NL*
she
combated
her
objections
,
she
had
a
strong
feeling
that
,
having
*NL*
been
the
one
who
began
the
game
,
she
ought
in
honesty
to
accept
the
*NL*
consequences
.
Still
the
reluctance
remained
.
She
said
in
the
same
*NL*
breath
that
it
would
be
ungenerous
not
to
marry
Boldwood
,
and
that
*NL*
she
could
n't
do
it
to
save
her
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
was
an
impulsive
nature
under
a
deliberative
aspect
.
An
*NL*
Elizabeth
in
brain
and
a
Mary
Stuart
in
spirit
,
she
often
performed
*NL*
actions
of
the
greatest
temerity
with
a
manner
of
extreme
discretion
.
*NL*
Many
of
her
thoughts
were
perfect
syllogisms
;
unluckily
they
always
*NL*
remained
thoughts
.
Only
a
few
were
irrational
assumptions
;
but
,
*NL*
unfortunately
,
they
were
the
ones
which
most
frequently
grew
into
*NL*
deeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
to
that
of
the
declaration
she
found
Gabriel
Oak
at
the
*NL*
bottom
of
her
garden
,
grinding
his
shears
for
the
sheep-shearing
.
*NL*
All
the
surrounding
cottages
were
more
or
less
scenes
of
the
same
*NL*
operation
;
the
scurr
of
whetting
spread
into
the
sky
from
all
parts
*NL*
of
the
village
as
from
an
armoury
previous
to
a
campaign
.
Peace
and
*NL*
war
kiss
each
other
at
their
hours
of
preparation
--
sickles
,
scythes
,
*NL*
shears
,
and
pruning-hooks
,
ranking
with
swords
,
bayonets
,
and
lances
,
*NL*
in
their
common
necessity
for
point
and
edge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cainy
Ball
turned
the
handle
of
Gabriel
's
grindstone
,
his
head
*NL*
performing
a
melancholy
see-saw
up
and
down
with
each
turn
of
the
*NL*
wheel
.
Oak
stood
somewhat
as
Eros
is
represented
when
in
the
act
of
*NL*
sharpening
his
arrows
:
his
figure
slightly
bent
,
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
body
thrown
over
on
the
shears
,
and
his
head
balanced
side-ways
,
with
*NL*
a
critical
compression
of
the
lips
and
contraction
of
the
eyelids
to
*NL*
crown
the
attitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mistress
came
up
and
looked
upon
them
in
silence
for
a
minute
or
*NL*
two
;
then
she
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cain
,
go
to
the
lower
mead
and
catch
the
bay
mare
.
I
'll
turn
the
*NL*
winch
of
the
grindstone
.
I
want
to
speak
to
you
,
Gabriel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cain
departed
,
and
Bathsheba
took
the
handle
.
Gabriel
had
glanced
up
*NL*
in
intense
surprise
,
quelled
its
expression
,
and
looked
down
again
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
turned
the
winch
,
and
Gabriel
applied
the
shears
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
peculiar
motion
involved
in
turning
a
wheel
has
a
wonderful
*NL*
tendency
to
benumb
the
mind
.
It
is
a
sort
of
attenuated
variety
of
*NL*
Ixion
's
punishment
,
and
contributes
a
dismal
chapter
to
the
history
*NL*
of
gaols
.
The
brain
gets
muddled
,
the
head
grows
heavy
,
and
the
*NL*
body
's
centre
of
gravity
seems
to
settle
by
degrees
in
a
leaden
lump
*NL*
somewhere
between
the
eyebrows
and
the
crown
.
Bathsheba
felt
the
*NL*
unpleasant
symptoms
after
two
or
three
dozen
turns
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
turn
,
Gabriel
,
and
let
me
hold
the
shears
?
''
she
said
.
``
My
*NL*
head
is
in
a
whirl
,
and
I
ca
n't
talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
turned
.
Bathsheba
then
began
,
with
some
awkwardness
,
*NL*
allowing
her
thoughts
to
stray
occasionally
from
her
story
to
attend
*NL*
to
the
shears
,
which
required
a
little
nicety
in
sharpening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
ask
you
if
the
men
made
any
observations
on
my
going
*NL*
behind
the
sedge
with
Mr.
Boldwood
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
did
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
You
do
n't
hold
the
shears
right
,
*NL*
miss
--
I
knew
you
would
n't
know
the
way
--
hold
like
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
relinquished
the
winch
,
and
inclosing
her
two
hands
completely
in
*NL*
his
own
-LRB-
taking
each
as
we
sometimes
slap
a
child
's
hand
in
teaching
*NL*
him
to
write
-RRB-
,
grasped
the
shears
with
her
.
``
Incline
the
edge
so
,
''
*NL*
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hands
and
shears
were
inclined
to
suit
the
words
,
and
held
thus
for
a
*NL*
peculiarly
long
time
by
the
instructor
as
he
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
will
do
,
''
exclaimed
Bathsheba
.
``
Loose
my
hands
.
I
wo
n't
have
*NL*
them
held
!
Turn
the
winch
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
freed
her
hands
quietly
,
retired
to
his
handle
,
and
the
*NL*
grinding
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
the
men
think
it
odd
?
''
she
said
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Odd
was
not
the
idea
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
did
they
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
Farmer
Boldwood
's
name
and
your
own
were
likely
to
be
flung
*NL*
over
pulpit
together
before
the
year
was
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
by
the
look
of
them
!
Why
,
there
's
nothing
in
it
.
A
*NL*
more
foolish
remark
was
never
made
,
and
I
want
you
to
contradict
it
!
*NL*
that
's
what
I
came
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
looked
incredulous
and
sad
,
but
between
his
moments
of
*NL*
incredulity
,
relieved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
have
heard
our
conversation
,
''
she
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Bathsheba
!
''
said
Oak
,
stopping
the
handle
,
and
gazing
*NL*
into
her
face
with
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Everdene
,
you
mean
,
''
she
said
,
with
dignity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
this
,
that
if
Mr.
Boldwood
really
spoke
of
marriage
,
I
bai
n't
*NL*
going
to
tell
a
story
and
say
he
did
n't
to
please
you
.
I
have
*NL*
already
tried
to
please
you
too
much
for
my
own
good
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
regarded
him
with
round-eyed
perplexity
.
She
did
not
know
*NL*
whether
to
pity
him
for
disappointed
love
of
her
,
or
to
be
angry
with
*NL*
him
for
having
got
over
it
--
his
tone
being
ambiguous
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
said
I
wanted
you
just
to
mention
that
it
was
not
true
I
was
going
*NL*
to
be
married
to
him
,
''
she
murmured
,
with
a
slight
decline
in
her
*NL*
assurance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
say
that
to
them
if
you
wish
,
Miss
Everdene
.
And
I
could
*NL*
likewise
give
an
opinion
to
`
ee
on
what
you
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
daresay
.
But
I
do
n't
want
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
not
,
''
said
Gabriel
bitterly
,
and
going
on
with
his
*NL*
turning
,
his
words
rising
and
falling
in
a
regular
swell
and
cadence
*NL*
as
he
stooped
or
rose
with
the
winch
,
which
directed
them
,
according
*NL*
to
his
position
,
perpendicularly
into
the
earth
,
or
horizontally
*NL*
along
the
garden
,
his
eyes
being
fixed
on
a
leaf
upon
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Bathsheba
a
hastened
act
was
a
rash
act
;
but
,
as
does
not
always
*NL*
happen
,
time
gained
was
prudence
insured
.
It
must
be
added
,
however
,
*NL*
that
time
was
very
seldom
gained
.
At
this
period
the
single
opinion
*NL*
in
the
parish
on
herself
and
her
doings
that
she
valued
as
sounder
*NL*
than
her
own
was
Gabriel
Oak
's
.
And
the
outspoken
honesty
of
his
*NL*
character
was
such
that
on
any
subject
,
even
that
of
her
love
for
,
*NL*
or
marriage
with
,
another
man
,
the
same
disinterestedness
of
opinion
*NL*
might
be
calculated
on
,
and
be
had
for
the
asking
.
Thoroughly
*NL*
convinced
of
the
impossibility
of
his
own
suit
,
a
high
resolve
*NL*
constrained
him
not
to
injure
that
of
another
.
This
is
a
lover
's
*NL*
most
stoical
virtue
,
as
the
lack
of
it
is
a
lover
's
most
venial
sin
.
*NL*
Knowing
he
would
reply
truly
she
asked
the
question
,
painful
as
*NL*
she
must
have
known
the
subject
would
be
.
Such
is
the
selfishness
*NL*
of
some
charming
women
.
Perhaps
it
was
some
excuse
for
her
thus
*NL*
torturing
honesty
to
her
own
advantage
,
that
she
had
absolutely
no
*NL*
other
sound
judgment
within
easy
reach
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
your
opinion
of
my
conduct
,
''
she
said
,
quietly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
it
is
unworthy
of
any
thoughtful
,
and
meek
,
and
comely
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
Bathsheba
's
face
coloured
with
the
angry
crimson
of
*NL*
a
Danby
sunset
.
But
she
forbore
to
utter
this
feeling
,
and
the
*NL*
reticence
of
her
tongue
only
made
the
loquacity
of
her
face
the
more
*NL*
noticeable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
thing
Gabriel
did
was
to
make
a
mistake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
you
do
n't
like
the
rudeness
of
my
reprimanding
you
,
for
I
*NL*
know
it
is
rudeness
;
but
I
thought
it
would
do
good
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
instantly
replied
sarcastically
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
On
the
contrary
,
my
opinion
of
you
is
so
low
,
that
I
see
in
your
*NL*
abuse
the
praise
of
discerning
people
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
do
n't
mind
it
,
for
I
said
it
honestly
and
with
every
*NL*
serious
meaning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
But
,
unfortunately
,
when
you
try
not
to
speak
in
jest
you
*NL*
are
amusing
--
just
as
when
you
wish
to
avoid
seriousness
you
sometimes
*NL*
say
a
sensible
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
hard
hit
,
but
Bathsheba
had
unmistakably
lost
her
temper
,
*NL*
and
on
that
account
Gabriel
had
never
in
his
life
kept
his
own
*NL*
better
.
He
said
nothing
.
She
then
broke
out
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
ask
,
I
suppose
,
where
in
particular
my
unworthiness
lies
?
In
*NL*
my
not
marrying
you
,
perhaps
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
by
any
means
,
''
said
Gabriel
quietly
.
``
I
have
long
given
up
*NL*
thinking
of
that
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
wishing
it
,
I
suppose
,
''
she
said
;
and
it
was
apparent
that
she
*NL*
expected
an
unhesitating
denial
of
this
supposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
Gabriel
felt
,
he
coolly
echoed
her
words
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
wishing
it
either
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
may
be
treated
with
a
bitterness
which
is
sweet
to
her
,
*NL*
and
with
a
rudeness
which
is
not
offensive
.
Bathsheba
would
have
*NL*
submitted
to
an
indignant
chastisement
for
her
levity
had
Gabriel
*NL*
protested
that
he
was
loving
her
at
the
same
time
;
the
impetuosity
*NL*
of
passion
unrequited
is
bearable
,
even
if
it
stings
and
*NL*
anathematizes
--
there
is
a
triumph
in
the
humiliation
,
and
a
*NL*
tenderness
in
the
strife
.
This
was
what
she
had
been
expecting
,
*NL*
and
what
she
had
not
got
.
To
be
lectured
because
the
lecturer
saw
*NL*
her
in
the
cold
morning
light
of
open-shuttered
disillusion
was
*NL*
exasperating
.
He
had
not
finished
,
either
.
He
continued
in
a
more
*NL*
agitated
voice
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
opinion
is
-LRB-
since
you
ask
it
-RRB-
that
you
are
greatly
to
blame
for
*NL*
playing
pranks
upon
a
man
like
Mr.
Boldwood
,
merely
as
a
pastime
.
*NL*
Leading
on
a
man
you
do
n't
care
for
is
not
a
praiseworthy
action
.
*NL*
And
even
,
Miss
Everdene
,
if
you
seriously
inclined
towards
him
,
you
*NL*
might
have
let
him
find
it
out
in
some
way
of
true
loving-kindness
,
*NL*
and
not
by
sending
him
a
valentine
's
letter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
laid
down
the
shears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
allow
any
man
to
--
to
criticise
my
private
conduct
!
''
she
*NL*
exclaimed
.
``
Nor
will
I
for
a
minute
.
So
you
'll
please
leave
the
*NL*
farm
at
the
end
of
the
week
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
may
have
been
a
peculiarity
--
at
any
rate
it
was
a
fact
--
that
when
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
swayed
by
an
emotion
of
an
earthly
sort
her
lower
lip
*NL*
trembled
:
when
by
a
refined
emotion
,
her
upper
or
heavenward
one
.
*NL*
Her
nether
lip
quivered
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
so
I
will
,
''
said
Gabriel
calmly
.
He
had
been
held
to
*NL*
her
by
a
beautiful
thread
which
it
pained
him
to
spoil
by
breaking
,
*NL*
rather
than
by
a
chain
he
could
not
break
.
``
I
should
be
even
better
*NL*
pleased
to
go
at
once
,
''
he
added
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
at
once
then
,
in
Heaven
's
name
!
''
said
she
,
her
eyes
flashing
at
*NL*
his
,
though
never
meeting
them
.
``
Do
n't
let
me
see
your
face
any
*NL*
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
Miss
Everdene
--
so
it
shall
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
took
his
shears
and
went
away
from
her
in
placid
dignity
,
as
*NL*
Moses
left
the
presence
of
Pharaoh
.

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
TROUBLES
IN
THE
FOLD
--
A
MESSAGE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
Oak
had
ceased
to
feed
the
Weatherbury
flock
for
about
*NL*
four-and-twenty
hours
,
when
on
Sunday
afternoon
the
elderly
gentlemen
*NL*
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
Matthew
Moon
,
Fray
,
and
half-a-dozen
others
,
came
*NL*
running
up
to
the
house
of
the
mistress
of
the
Upper
Farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
IS
the
matter
,
men
?
''
she
said
,
meeting
them
at
the
door
*NL*
just
as
she
was
coming
out
on
her
way
to
church
,
and
ceasing
in
a
*NL*
moment
from
the
close
compression
of
her
two
red
lips
,
with
which
*NL*
she
had
accompanied
the
exertion
of
pulling
on
a
tight
glove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sixty
!
''
said
Joseph
Poorgrass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventy
!
''
said
Moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fifty-nine
!
''
said
Susan
Tall
's
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Sheep
have
broke
fence
,
''
said
Fray
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
And
got
into
a
field
of
young
clover
,
''
said
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Young
clover
!
''
said
Moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Clover
!
''
said
Joseph
Poorgrass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
they
be
getting
blasted
,
''
said
Henery
Fray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
they
be
,
''
said
Joseph
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
will
all
die
as
dead
as
nits
,
if
they
bai
n't
got
out
and
cured
!
''
*NL*
said
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
's
countenance
was
drawn
into
lines
and
puckers
by
his
concern
.
*NL*
Fray
's
forehead
was
wrinkled
both
perpendicularly
and
crosswise
,
*NL*
after
the
pattern
of
a
portcullis
,
expressive
of
a
double
despair
.
*NL*
Laban
Tall
's
lips
were
thin
,
and
his
face
was
rigid
.
Matthew
's
jaws
*NL*
sank
,
and
his
eyes
turned
whichever
way
the
strongest
muscle
happened
*NL*
to
pull
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Joseph
,
``
and
I
was
sitting
at
home
,
looking
for
*NL*
Ephesians
,
and
says
I
to
myself
,
''
Tis
nothing
but
Corinthians
and
*NL*
Thessalonians
in
this
danged
Testament
,
'
when
who
should
come
in
but
*NL*
Henery
there
:
`
Joseph
,
'
he
said
,
`
the
sheep
have
blasted
*NL*
theirselves
--
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
Bathsheba
it
was
a
moment
when
thought
was
speech
and
speech
*NL*
exclamation
.
Moreover
,
she
had
hardly
recovered
her
equanimity
since
*NL*
the
disturbance
which
she
had
suffered
from
Oak
's
remarks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
enough
--
that
's
enough
!
--
oh
,
you
fools
!
''
she
cried
,
throwing
*NL*
the
parasol
and
Prayer-book
into
the
passage
,
and
running
out
of
*NL*
doors
in
the
direction
signified
.
``
To
come
to
me
,
and
not
go
and
get
*NL*
them
out
directly
!
Oh
,
the
stupid
numskulls
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eyes
were
at
their
darkest
and
brightest
now
.
Bathsheba
's
beauty
*NL*
belonging
rather
to
the
demonian
than
to
the
angelic
school
,
she
*NL*
never
looked
so
well
as
when
she
was
angry
--
and
particularly
when
the
*NL*
effect
was
heightened
by
a
rather
dashing
velvet
dress
,
carefully
put
*NL*
on
before
a
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
ancient
men
ran
in
a
jumbled
throng
after
her
to
the
*NL*
clover-field
,
Joseph
sinking
down
in
the
midst
when
about
half-way
,
*NL*
like
an
individual
withering
in
a
world
which
was
more
and
more
*NL*
insupportable
.
Having
once
received
the
stimulus
that
her
presence
*NL*
always
gave
them
they
went
round
among
the
sheep
with
a
will
.
The
*NL*
majority
of
the
afflicted
animals
were
lying
down
,
and
could
not
be
*NL*
stirred
.
These
were
bodily
lifted
out
,
and
the
others
driven
into
*NL*
the
adjoining
field
.
Here
,
after
the
lapse
of
a
few
minutes
,
several
*NL*
more
fell
down
,
and
lay
helpless
and
livid
as
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
with
a
sad
,
bursting
heart
,
looked
at
these
primest
*NL*
specimens
of
her
prime
flock
as
they
rolled
there
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Swoln
with
wind
and
the
rank
mist
they
drew
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Many
of
them
foamed
at
the
mouth
,
their
breathing
being
quick
and
*NL*
short
,
whilst
the
bodies
of
all
were
fearfully
distended
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
can
I
do
,
what
can
I
do
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
helplessly
.
*NL*
``
Sheep
are
such
unfortunate
animals
!
--
there
's
always
something
*NL*
happening
to
them
!
I
never
knew
a
flock
pass
a
year
without
getting
*NL*
into
some
scrape
or
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
only
one
way
of
saving
them
,
''
said
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
way
?
Tell
me
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
must
be
pierced
in
the
side
with
a
thing
made
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
do
it
?
Can
I
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
.
We
ca
n't
,
nor
you
neither
.
It
must
be
done
in
a
*NL*
particular
spot
.
If
ye
go
to
the
right
or
left
but
an
inch
you
stab
*NL*
the
ewe
and
kill
her
.
Not
even
a
shepherd
can
do
it
,
as
a
rule
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
must
die
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
resigned
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
one
man
in
the
neighbourhood
knows
the
way

said

Ah

*NL*
*NL*
``

Tall

*NL*
*NL*
``
How

she
said
excitedly

Ah

she
added
,
brightening
,
``
Farmer

*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no

said
Matthew
.
``
Two
of
his

ewes
got
into
some

were

He
sent
a

for
Gable

Gable
went
and
saved

*NL*
Farmer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

echoed
Joseph

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

chimed
in
Henery
Fray
,
reflectively
,
*NL*
with
an
Oriental
indifference
to
the
flight
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
burst
out
Bathsheba
,
``
do
n't
stand
there
with
your
`

*NL*
and
your
`
sures
'
talking
at
me
!
Get
somebody
to
cure
the
sheep
*NL*
instantly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
then
stalked
off
in
consternation
,
to
get
somebody
as
directed
,
*NL*
without
any
idea
of
who
it
was
to
be
.
In
a
minute
they
had
vanished
*NL*
through
the
gate
,
and
she
stood
alone
with
the
dying
flock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
will
I
send
for
him
--
never
!
''
she
said
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
ewes
here
contracted
its
muscles
horribly
,
extended
*NL*
itself
,
and
jumped
high
into
the
air
.
The
leap
was
an
astonishing
*NL*
one
.
The
ewe
fell
heavily
,
and
lay
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
went
up
to
it
.
The
sheep
was
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
shall
I
do
--
what
shall
I
do
!
''
she
again
exclaimed
,
wringing
*NL*
her
hands
.
``
I
wo
n't
send
for
him
.
No
,
I
wo
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
vigorous
expression
of
a
resolution
does
not
always
coincide
*NL*
with
the
greatest
vigour
of
the
resolution
itself
.
It
is
often
flung
*NL*
out
as
a
sort
of
prop
to
support
a
decaying
conviction
which
,
whilst
*NL*
strong
,
required
no
enunciation
to
prove
it
so
.
The
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
''
of
*NL*
Bathsheba
meant
virtually
,
``
I
think
I
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
her
assistants
through
the
gate
,
and
lifted
her
hand
to
*NL*
one
of
them
.
Laban
answered
to
her
signal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
Oak
staying
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Across
the
valley
at
Nest
Cottage

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jump
on

bay
mare
,

ride
across
,
and
say
he
must
return
*NL*
instantly
--
that
I

so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tall
scrambled
off
to
the
field
,
and
in
two
minutes
was
on
Poll
,
*NL*
the
bay
,
bare-backed
,
and
with
only
a
halter
by
way
of
rein
.
He
*NL*
diminished
down
the
hill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
watched
.
So
did
all
the
rest
.
Tall
cantered
along
the
*NL*
bridle-path
through
Sixteen
Acres
,
Sheeplands
,
Middle
Field
,
The
*NL*
Flats
,
Cappel
's
Piece
,
shrank
almost
to
a
point
,
crossed
the
bridge
,
*NL*
and
ascended
from
the
valley
through
Springmead
and
Whitepits
on
the
*NL*
other
side
.
The
cottage
to
which
Gabriel
had
retired
before
taking
*NL*
his
final
departure
from
the
locality
was
visible
as
a
white
spot
on
*NL*
the
opposite
hill
,
backed
by
blue
firs
.
Bathsheba
walked
up
and
*NL*
down
.
The
men
entered
the
field
and
endeavoured
to
ease
the
anguish
*NL*
of
the
dumb
creatures
by
rubbing
them
.
Nothing
availed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
continued
walking
.
The
horse
was
seen
descending
the
*NL*
hill
,
and
the
wearisome
series
had
to
be
repeated
in
reverse
order
:
*NL*
Whitepits
,
Springmead
,
Cappel
's
Piece
,
The
Flats
,
Middle
Field
,
*NL*
Sheeplands
,
Sixteen
Acres
.
She
hoped
Tall
had
had
presence
of
mind
*NL*
enough
to
give
the
mare
up
to
Gabriel
,
and
return
himself
on
foot
.
*NL*
The
rider
neared
them
.
It
was
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
what
folly
!
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
was
not
visible
anywhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
is
already
gone
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tall
came
into
the
inclosure
,
and
leapt
off
,
his
face
tragic
as
*NL*
Morton
's
after
the
battle
of
Shrewsbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
Bathsheba
,
unwilling
to
believe
that
her
verbal
*NL*
_
lettre-de-cachet
_
could
possibly
have
miscarried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
BEGGARS
MUST
N'T
BE
CHOOSERS
,
''
replied
Laban
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
said
the
young
farmer
,
opening
her
eyes
and
drawing
in
her
*NL*
breath
for
an
outburst
.
Joseph
Poorgrass
retired
a
few
steps
behind
*NL*
a
hurdle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
says
he
shall
not
come
onless
you
request
en
to
come
civilly
and
*NL*
in
a
proper
manner
,
as
becomes
any
`
ooman
begging
a
favour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
oh
,
that
's
his
answer
!
Where
does
he
get
his
airs
?
Who
am
I
,
*NL*
then
,
to
be
treated
like
that
?
Shall
I
beg
to
a
man
who
has
begged
*NL*
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
of
the
flock
sprang
into
the
air
,
and
fell
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
looked
grave
,
as
if
they
suppressed
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
turned
aside
,
her
eyes
full
of
tears
.
The
strait
she
was
*NL*
in
through
pride
and
shrewishness
could
not
be
disguised
longer
:
she
*NL*
burst
out
crying
bitterly
;
they
all
saw
it
;
and
she
attempted
no
*NL*
further
concealment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
cry
about
it
,
miss
,
''
said
William
Smallbury
,
*NL*
compassionately
.
``
Why
not
ask
him
softer
like
?
I
'm
sure
he
'd
come
*NL*
then
.
Gable
is
a
true
man
in
that
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
checked
her
grief
and
wiped
her
eyes
.
``
Oh
,
it
is
a
wicked
*NL*
cruelty
to
me
--
it
is
--
it
is
!
''
she
murmured
.
``
And
he
drives
me
to
do
*NL*
what
I
would
n't
;
yes
,
he
does
!
--
Tall
,
come
indoors
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
collapse
,
not
very
dignified
for
the
head
of
an
*NL*
establishment
,
she
went
into
the
house
,
Tall
at
her
heels
.
Here
she
*NL*
sat
down
and
hastily
scribbled
a
note
between
the
small
convulsive
*NL*
sobs
of
convalescence
which
follow
a
fit
of
crying
as
a
ground-swell
*NL*
follows
a
storm
.
The
note
was
none
the
less
polite
for
being
written
*NL*
in
a
hurry
.
She
held
it
at
a
distance
,
was
about
to
fold
it
,
then
*NL*
added
these
words
at
the
bottom
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
DO
NOT
DESERT
ME
,
GABRIEL
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
a
little
redder
in
refolding
it
,
and
closed
her
lips
,
*NL*
as
if
thereby
to
suspend
till
too
late
the
action
of
conscience
in
*NL*
examining
whether
such
strategy
were
justifiable
.
The
note
was
*NL*
despatched
as
the
message
had
been
,
and
Bathsheba
waited
indoors
*NL*
for
the
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
an
anxious
quarter
of
an
hour
that
intervened
between
the
*NL*
messenger
's
departure
and
the
sound
of
the
horse
's
tramp
again
*NL*
outside
.
She
could
not
watch
this
time
,
but
,
leaning
over
the
old
*NL*
bureau
at
which
she
had
written
the
letter
,
closed
her
eyes
,
as
if
*NL*
to
keep
out
both
hope
and
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
case
,
however
,
was
a
promising
one
.
Gabriel
was
not
angry
:
he
*NL*
was
simply
neutral
,
although
her
first
command
had
been
so
haughty
.
*NL*
Such
imperiousness
would
have
damned
a
little
less
beauty
;
and
*NL*
on
the
other
hand
,
such
beauty
would
have
redeemed
a
little
less
*NL*
imperiousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
out
when
the
horse
was
heard
,
and
looked
up
.
A
mounted
*NL*
figure
passed
between
her
and
the
sky
,
and
drew
on
towards
the
field
*NL*
of
sheep
,
the
rider
turning
his
face
in
receding
.
Gabriel
looked
at
*NL*
her
.
It
was
a
moment
when
a
woman
's
eyes
and
tongue
tell
distinctly
*NL*
opposite
tales
.
Bathsheba
looked
full
of
gratitude
,
and
she
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Gabriel
,
how
could
you
serve
me
so
unkindly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
tenderly-shaped
reproach
for
his
previous
delay
was
the
*NL*
one
speech
in
the
language
that
he
could
pardon
for
not
being
*NL*
commendation
of
his
readiness
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
murmured
a
confused
reply
,
and
hastened
on
.
She
knew
from
*NL*
the
look
which
sentence
in
her
note
had
brought
him
.
Bathsheba
*NL*
followed
to
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
was
already
among
the
turgid
,
prostrate
forms
.
He
had
flung
*NL*
off
his
coat
,
rolled
up
his
shirt-sleeves
,
and
taken
from
his
pocket
*NL*
the
instrument
of
salvation
.
It
was
a
small
tube
or
trochar
,
with
*NL*
a
lance
passing
down
the
inside
;
and
Gabriel
began
to
use
it
with
a
*NL*
dexterity
that
would
have
graced
a
hospital
surgeon
.
Passing
his
*NL*
hand
over
the
sheep
's
left
flank
,
and
selecting
the
proper
point
,
he
*NL*
punctured
the
skin
and
rumen
with
the
lance
as
it
stood
in
the
tube
;
*NL*
then
he
suddenly
withdrew
the
lance
,
retaining
the
tube
in
its
place
.
*NL*
A
current
of
air
rushed
up
the
tube
,
forcible
enough
to
have
*NL*
extinguished
a
candle
held
at
the
orifice
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
said
that
mere
ease
after
torment
is
delight
for
a
time
;
*NL*
and
the
countenances
of
these
poor
creatures
expressed
it
now
.
*NL*
Forty-nine
operations
were
successfully
performed
.
Owing
to
the
*NL*
great
hurry
necessitated
by
the
far-gone
state
of
some
of
the
flock
,
*NL*
Gabriel
missed
his
aim
in
one
case
,
and
in
one
only
--
striking
wide
*NL*
of
the
mark
,
and
inflicting
a
mortal
blow
at
once
upon
the
suffering
*NL*
ewe
.
Four
had
died
;
three
recovered
without
an
operation
.
The
total
*NL*
number
of
sheep
which
had
thus
strayed
and
injured
themselves
so
*NL*
dangerously
was
fifty-seven
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
love-led
man
had
ceased
from
his
labours
,
Bathsheba
came
and
*NL*
looked
him
in
the
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
,
will
you
stay
on
with
me
?
''
she
said
,
smiling
winningly
,
*NL*
and
not
troubling
to
bring
her
lips
quite
together
again
at
the
end
,
*NL*
because
there
was
going
to
be
another
smile
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
smiled
on
him
again
.

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
GREAT
BARN
AND
THE
SHEEP-SHEARERS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Men
thin
away
to
insignificance
and
oblivion
quite
as
often
by
not
*NL*
making
the
most
of
good
spirits
when
they
have
them
as
by
lacking
*NL*
good
spirits
when
they
are
indispensable
.
Gabriel
lately
,
for
the
*NL*
first
time
since
his
prostration
by
misfortune
,
had
been
independent
*NL*
in
thought
and
vigorous
in
action
to
a
marked
extent
--
conditions
*NL*
which
,
powerless
without
an
opportunity
as
an
opportunity
without
*NL*
them
is
barren
,
would
have
given
him
a
sure
lift
upwards
when
the
*NL*
favourable
conjunction
should
have
occurred
.
But
this
incurable
*NL*
loitering
beside
Bathsheba
Everdene
stole
his
time
ruinously
.
The
*NL*
spring
tides
were
going
by
without
floating
him
off
,
and
the
neap
*NL*
might
soon
come
which
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
day
of
June
,
and
the
sheep-shearing
season
*NL*
culminated
,
the
landscape
,
even
to
the
leanest
pasture
,
being
*NL*
all
health
and
colour
.
Every
green
was
young
,
every
pore
was
*NL*
open
,
and
every
stalk
was
swollen
with
racing
currents
of
juice
.
*NL*
God
was
palpably
present
in
the
country
,
and
the
devil
had
gone
*NL*
with
the
world
to
town
.
Flossy
catkins
of
the
later
kinds
,
*NL*
fern-sprouts
like
bishops
'
croziers
,
the
square-headed
moschatel
,
*NL*
the
odd
cuckoo-pint
,
--
like
an
apoplectic
saint
in
a
niche
of
*NL*
malachite
,
--
snow-white
ladies
'
-
smocks
,
the
toothwort
,
approximating
*NL*
to
human
flesh
,
the
enchanter
's
night-shade
,
and
the
black-petaled
*NL*
doleful-bells
,
were
among
the
quainter
objects
of
the
vegetable
world
*NL*
in
and
about
Weatherbury
at
this
teeming
time
;
and
of
the
animal
,
*NL*
the
metamorphosed
figures
of
Mr.
Jan
Coggan
,
the
master-shearer
;
the
*NL*
second
and
third
shearers
,
who
travelled
in
the
exercise
of
their
*NL*
calling
,
and
do
not
require
definition
by
name
;
Henery
Fray
the
*NL*
fourth
shearer
,
Susan
Tall
's
husband
the
fifth
,
Joseph
Poorgrass
*NL*
the
sixth
,
young
Cain
Ball
as
assistant-shearer
,
and
Gabriel
Oak
as
*NL*
general
supervisor
.
None
of
these
were
clothed
to
any
extent
worth
*NL*
mentioning
,
each
appearing
to
have
hit
in
the
matter
of
raiment
the
*NL*
decent
mean
between
a
high
and
low
caste
Hindoo
.
An
angularity
of
*NL*
lineament
,
and
a
fixity
of
facial
machinery
in
general
,
proclaimed
*NL*
that
serious
work
was
the
order
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sheared
in
the
great
barn
,
called
for
the
nonce
the
*NL*
Shearing-barn
,
which
on
ground-plan
resembled
a
church
with
*NL*
transepts
.
It
not
only
emulated
the
form
of
the
neighbouring
church
*NL*
of
the
parish
,
but
vied
with
it
in
antiquity
.
Whether
the
barn
had
*NL*
ever
formed
one
of
a
group
of
conventual
buildings
nobody
seemed
to
*NL*
be
aware
;
no
trace
of
such
surroundings
remained
.
The
vast
porches
*NL*
at
the
sides
,
lofty
enough
to
admit
a
waggon
laden
to
its
highest
*NL*
with
corn
in
the
sheaf
,
were
spanned
by
heavy-pointed
arches
of
*NL*
stone
,
broadly
and
boldly
cut
,
whose
very
simplicity
was
the
origin
*NL*
of
a
grandeur
not
apparent
in
erections
where
more
ornament
has
been
*NL*
attempted
.
The
dusky
,
filmed
,
chestnut
roof
,
braced
and
tied
in
*NL*
by
huge
collars
,
curves
,
and
diagonals
,
was
far
nobler
in
design
,
*NL*
because
more
wealthy
in
material
,
than
nine-tenths
of
those
in
our
*NL*
modern
churches
.
Along
each
side
wall
was
a
range
of
striding
*NL*
buttresses
,
throwing
deep
shadows
on
the
spaces
between
them
,
which
*NL*
were
perforated
by
lancet
openings
,
combining
in
their
proportions
*NL*
the
precise
requirements
both
of
beauty
and
ventilation
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
could
say
about
this
barn
,
what
could
hardly
be
said
of
either
*NL*
the
church
or
the
castle
,
akin
to
it
in
age
and
style
,
that
the
*NL*
purpose
which
had
dictated
its
original
erection
was
the
same
with
*NL*
that
to
which
it
was
still
applied
.
Unlike
and
superior
to
either
*NL*
of
those
two
typical
remnants
of
mediaevalism
,
the
old
barn
embodied
*NL*
practices
which
had
suffered
no
mutilation
at
the
hands
of
time
.
*NL*
Here
at
least
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
builders
was
at
one
with
*NL*
the
spirit
of
the
modern
beholder
.
Standing
before
this
abraded
*NL*
pile
,
the
eye
regarded
its
present
usage
,
the
mind
dwelt
upon
its
*NL*
past
history
,
with
a
satisfied
sense
of
functional
continuity
*NL*
throughout
--
a
feeling
almost
of
gratitude
,
and
quite
of
pride
,
at
the
*NL*
permanence
of
the
idea
which
had
heaped
it
up
.
The
fact
that
four
*NL*
centuries
had
neither
proved
it
to
be
founded
on
a
mistake
,
inspired
*NL*
any
hatred
of
its
purpose
,
nor
given
rise
to
any
reaction
that
had
*NL*
battered
it
down
,
invested
this
simple
grey
effort
of
old
minds
with
*NL*
a
repose
,
if
not
a
grandeur
,
which
a
too
curious
reflection
was
apt
*NL*
to
disturb
in
its
ecclesiastical
and
military
compeers
.
For
once
*NL*
mediaevalism
and
modernism
had
a
common
stand-point
.
The
lanceolate
*NL*
windows
,
the
time-eaten
archstones
and
chamfers
,
the
orientation
of
*NL*
the
axis
,
the
misty
chestnut
work
of
the
rafters
,
referred
to
no
*NL*
exploded
fortifying
art
or
worn-out
religious
creed
.
The
defence
and
*NL*
salvation
of
the
body
by
daily
bread
is
still
a
study
,
a
religion
,
*NL*
and
a
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
To-day
the
large
side
doors
were
thrown
open
towards
the
sun
to
admit
*NL*
a
bountiful
light
to
the
immediate
spot
of
the
shearers
'
operations
,
*NL*
which
was
the
wood
threshing-floor
in
the
centre
,
formed
of
thick
*NL*
oak
,
black
with
age
and
polished
by
the
beating
of
flails
for
many
*NL*
generations
,
till
it
had
grown
as
slippery
and
as
rich
in
hue
as
*NL*
the
state-room
floors
of
an
Elizabethan
mansion
.
Here
the
shearers
*NL*
knelt
,
the
sun
slanting
in
upon
their
bleached
shirts
,
tanned
arms
,
*NL*
and
the
polished
shears
they
flourished
,
causing
these
to
bristle
*NL*
with
a
thousand
rays
strong
enough
to
blind
a
weak-eyed
man
.
Beneath
*NL*
them
a
captive
sheep
lay
panting
,
quickening
its
pants
as
misgiving
*NL*
merged
in
terror
,
till
it
quivered
like
the
hot
landscape
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
picture
of
to-day
in
its
frame
of
four
hundred
years
ago
did
*NL*
not
produce
that
marked
contrast
between
ancient
and
modern
which
*NL*
is
implied
by
the
contrast
of
date
.
In
comparison
with
cities
,
*NL*
Weatherbury
was
immutable
.
The
citizen
's
THEN
is
the
rustic
's
*NL*
NOW
.
In
London
,
twenty
or
thirty-years
ago
are
old
times
;
in
Paris
*NL*
ten
years
,
or
five
;
in
Weatherbury
three
or
four
score
years
were
*NL*
included
in
the
mere
present
,
and
nothing
less
than
a
century
set
a
*NL*
mark
on
its
face
or
tone
.
Five
decades
hardly
modified
the
cut
of
a
*NL*
gaiter
,
the
embroidery
of
a
smock-frock
,
by
the
breadth
of
a
hair
.
*NL*
Ten
generations
failed
to
alter
the
turn
of
a
single
phrase
.
In
*NL*
these
Wessex
nooks
the
busy
outsider
's
ancient
times
are
only
old
;
*NL*
his
old
times
are
still
new
;
his
present
is
futurity
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
barn
was
natural
to
the
shearers
,
and
the
shearers
were
in
*NL*
harmony
with
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
spacious
ends
of
the
building
,
answering
ecclesiastically
to
nave
*NL*
and
chancel
extremities
,
were
fenced
off
with
hurdles
,
the
sheep
*NL*
being
all
collected
in
a
crowd
within
these
two
enclosures
;
and
in
*NL*
one
angle
a
catching-pen
was
formed
,
in
which
three
or
four
sheep
*NL*
were
continuously
kept
ready
for
the
shearers
to
seize
without
loss
*NL*
of
time
.
In
the
background
,
mellowed
by
tawny
shade
,
were
the
three
*NL*
women
,
Maryann
Money
,
and
Temperance
and
Soberness
Miller
,
gathering
*NL*
up
the
fleeces
and
twisting
ropes
of
wool
with
a
wimble
for
tying
*NL*
them
round
.
They
were
indifferently
well
assisted
by
the
old
*NL*
maltster
,
who
,
when
the
malting
season
from
October
to
April
had
*NL*
passed
,
made
himself
useful
upon
any
of
the
bordering
farmsteads
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
all
was
Bathsheba
,
carefully
watching
the
men
to
see
that
*NL*
there
was
no
cutting
or
wounding
through
carelessness
,
and
that
the
*NL*
animals
were
shorn
close
.
Gabriel
,
who
flitted
and
hovered
under
her
*NL*
bright
eyes
like
a
moth
,
did
not
shear
continuously
,
half
his
time
*NL*
being
spent
in
attending
to
the
others
and
selecting
the
sheep
for
*NL*
them
.
At
the
present
moment
he
was
engaged
in
handing
round
a
mug
of
*NL*
mild
liquor
,
supplied
from
a
barrel
in
the
corner
,
and
cut
pieces
of
*NL*
bread
and
cheese
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
after
throwing
a
glance
here
,
a
caution
there
,
and
*NL*
lecturing
one
of
the
younger
operators
who
had
allowed
his
last
*NL*
finished
sheep
to
go
off
among
the
flock
without
re-stamping
it
with
*NL*
her
initials
,
came
again
to
Gabriel
,
as
he
put
down
the
luncheon
to
*NL*
drag
a
frightened
ewe
to
his
shear-station
,
flinging
it
over
upon
its
*NL*
back
with
a
dexterous
twist
of
the
arm
.
He
lopped
off
the
tresses
*NL*
about
its
head
,
and
opened
up
the
neck
and
collar
,
his
mistress
*NL*
quietly
looking
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
blushes
at
the
insult
,
''
murmured
Bathsheba
,
watching
the
pink
*NL*
flush
which
arose
and
overspread
the
neck
and
shoulders
of
the
ewe
*NL*
where
they
were
left
bare
by
the
clicking
shears
--
a
flush
which
was
*NL*
enviable
,
for
its
delicacy
,
by
many
queens
of
coteries
,
and
would
*NL*
have
been
creditable
,
for
its
promptness
,
to
any
woman
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Gabriel
's
soul
was
fed
with
a
luxury
of
content
by
having
her
*NL*
over
him
,
her
eyes
critically
regarding
his
skilful
shears
,
which
*NL*
apparently
were
going
to
gather
up
a
piece
of
the
flesh
at
every
*NL*
close
,
and
yet
never
did
so
.
Like
Guildenstern
,
Oak
was
happy
in
*NL*
that
he
was
not
over
happy
.
He
had
no
wish
to
converse
with
her
:
*NL*
that
his
bright
lady
and
himself
formed
one
group
,
exclusively
their
*NL*
own
,
and
containing
no
others
in
the
world
,
was
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
chatter
was
all
on
her
side
.
There
is
a
loquacity
that
tells
*NL*
nothing
,
which
was
Bathsheba
's
;
and
there
is
a
silence
which
says
*NL*
much
:
that
was
Gabriel
's
.
Full
of
this
dim
and
temperate
bliss
,
he
*NL*
went
on
to
fling
the
ewe
over
upon
her
other
side
,
covering
her
head
*NL*
with
his
knee
,
gradually
running
the
shears
line
after
line
round
her
*NL*
dewlap
;
thence
about
her
flank
and
back
,
and
finishing
over
the
tail
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
done
,
and
done
quickly
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
looking
at
her
watch
*NL*
as
the
last
snip
resounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
,
miss
?
''
said
Gabriel
,
wiping
his
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Three-and-twenty
minutes
and
a
half
since
you
took
the
first
lock
*NL*
from
its
forehead
.
It
is
the
first
time
that
I
have
ever
seen
one
*NL*
done
in
less
than
half
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
clean
,
sleek
creature
arose
from
its
fleece
--
how
perfectly
*NL*
like
Aphrodite
rising
from
the
foam
should
have
been
seen
to
be
*NL*
realized
--
looking
startled
and
shy
at
the
loss
of
its
garment
,
which
*NL*
lay
on
the
floor
in
one
soft
cloud
,
united
throughout
,
the
portion
*NL*
visible
being
the
inner
surface
only
,
which
,
never
before
exposed
,
*NL*
was
white
as
snow
,
and
without
flaw
or
blemish
of
the
minutest
kind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cain
Ball
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mister
Oak
;
here
I
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cainy
now
runs
forward
with
the
tar-pot
.
``
B.
E.
''
is
newly
stamped
*NL*
upon
the
shorn
skin
,
and
away
the
simple
dam
leaps
,
panting
,
over
the
*NL*
board
into
the
shirtless
flock
outside
.
Then
up
comes
Maryann
;
*NL*
throws
the
loose
locks
into
the
middle
of
the
fleece
,
rolls
it
up
,
*NL*
and
carries
it
into
the
background
as
three-and-a-half
pounds
of
*NL*
unadulterated
warmth
for
the
winter
enjoyment
of
persons
unknown
and
*NL*
far
away
,
who
will
,
however
,
never
experience
the
superlative
comfort
*NL*
derivable
from
the
wool
as
it
here
exists
,
new
and
pure
--
before
*NL*
the
unctuousness
of
its
nature
whilst
in
a
living
state
has
dried
,
*NL*
stiffened
,
and
been
washed
out
--
rendering
it
just
now
as
superior
*NL*
to
anything
WOOLLEN
as
cream
is
superior
to
milk-and-water
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
heartless
circumstance
could
not
leave
entire
Gabriel
's
happiness
*NL*
of
this
morning
.
The
rams
,
old
ewes
,
and
two-shear
ewes
had
duly
*NL*
undergone
their
stripping
,
and
the
men
were
proceeding
with
the
*NL*
shear-lings
and
hogs
,
when
Oak
's
belief
that
she
was
going
to
stand
*NL*
pleasantly
by
and
time
him
through
another
performance
was
painfully
*NL*
interrupted
by
Farmer
Boldwood
's
appearance
in
the
extremest
corner
*NL*
of
the
barn
.
Nobody
seemed
to
have
perceived
his
entry
,
but
there
he
*NL*
certainly
was
.
Boldwood
always
carried
with
him
a
social
atmosphere
*NL*
of
his
own
,
which
everybody
felt
who
came
near
him
;
and
the
talk
,
*NL*
which
Bathsheba
's
presence
had
somewhat
suppressed
,
was
now
totally
*NL*
suspended
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
over
towards
Bathsheba
,
who
turned
to
greet
him
with
a
*NL*
carriage
of
perfect
ease
.
He
spoke
to
her
in
low
tones
,
and
she
*NL*
instinctively
modulated
her
own
to
the
same
pitch
,
and
her
voice
*NL*
ultimately
even
caught
the
inflection
of
his
.
She
was
far
from
*NL*
having
a
wish
to
appear
mysteriously
connected
with
him
;
but
woman
at
*NL*
the
impressionable
age
gravitates
to
the
larger
body
not
only
in
her
*NL*
choice
of
words
,
which
is
apparent
every
day
,
but
even
in
her
shades
*NL*
of
tone
and
humour
,
when
the
influence
is
great
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
they
conversed
about
was
not
audible
to
Gabriel
,
who
was
too
*NL*
independent
to
get
near
,
though
too
concerned
to
disregard
.
The
*NL*
issue
of
their
dialogue
was
the
taking
of
her
hand
by
the
courteous
*NL*
farmer
to
help
her
over
the
spreading-board
into
the
bright
June
*NL*
sunlight
outside
.
Standing
beside
the
sheep
already
shorn
,
they
went
*NL*
on
talking
again
.
Concerning
the
flock
?
Apparently
not
.
Gabriel
*NL*
theorized
,
not
without
truth
,
that
in
quiet
discussion
of
any
matter
*NL*
within
reach
of
the
speakers
'
eyes
,
these
are
usually
fixed
upon
*NL*
it
.
Bathsheba
demurely
regarded
a
contemptible
straw
lying
upon
the
*NL*
ground
,
in
a
way
which
suggested
less
ovine
criticism
than
womanly
*NL*
embarrassment
.
She
became
more
or
less
red
in
the
cheek
,
the
blood
*NL*
wavering
in
uncertain
flux
and
reflux
over
the
sensitive
space
*NL*
between
ebb
and
flood
.
Gabriel
sheared
on
,
constrained
and
sad
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
Boldwood
's
side
,
and
he
walked
up
and
down
alone
for
nearly
*NL*
a
quarter
of
an
hour
.
Then
she
reappeared
in
her
new
riding-habit
of
*NL*
myrtle
green
,
which
fitted
her
to
the
waist
as
a
rind
fits
its
fruit
;
*NL*
and
young
Bob
Coggan
led
on
her
mare
,
Boldwood
fetching
his
own
horse
*NL*
from
the
tree
under
which
it
had
been
tied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
's
eyes
could
not
forsake
them
;
and
in
endeavouring
to
continue
*NL*
his
shearing
at
the
same
time
that
he
watched
Boldwood
's
manner
,
*NL*
he
snipped
the
sheep
in
the
groin
.
The
animal
plunged
;
Bathsheba
*NL*
instantly
gazed
towards
it
,
and
saw
the
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Gabriel
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
severe
remonstrance
,
``
you
who
are
*NL*
so
strict
with
the
other
men
--
see
what
you
are
doing
yourself
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
an
outsider
there
was
not
much
to
complain
of
in
this
remark
;
but
*NL*
to
Oak
,
who
knew
Bathsheba
to
be
well
aware
that
she
herself
was
the
*NL*
cause
of
the
poor
ewe
's
wound
,
because
she
had
wounded
the
ewe
's
*NL*
shearer
in
a
still
more
vital
part
,
it
had
a
sting
which
the
abiding
*NL*
sense
of
his
inferiority
to
both
herself
and
Boldwood
was
not
*NL*
calculated
to
heal
.
But
a
manly
resolve
to
recognize
boldly
that
he
*NL*
had
no
longer
a
lover
's
interest
in
her
,
helped
him
occasionally
to
*NL*
conceal
a
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bottle
!
''
he
shouted
,
in
an
unmoved
voice
of
routine
.
Cainy
Ball
ran
*NL*
up
,
the
wound
was
anointed
,
and
the
shearing
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
gently
tossed
Bathsheba
into
the
saddle
,
and
before
they
*NL*
turned
away
she
again
spoke
out
to
Oak
with
the
same
dominative
and
*NL*
tantalizing
graciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
going
now
to
see
Mr.
Boldwood
's
Leicesters
.
Take
my
place
in
*NL*
the
barn
,
Gabriel
,
and
keep
the
men
carefully
to
their
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horses
'
heads
were
put
about
,
and
they
trotted
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
's
deep
attachment
was
a
matter
of
great
interest
among
all
*NL*
around
him
;
but
,
after
having
been
pointed
out
for
so
many
years
*NL*
as
the
perfect
exemplar
of
thriving
bachelorship
,
his
lapse
was
an
*NL*
anticlimax
somewhat
resembling
that
of
St.
John
Long
's
death
by
*NL*
consumption
in
the
midst
of
his
proofs
that
it
was
not
a
fatal
*NL*
disease
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
means
matrimony
,
''
said
Temperance
Miller
,
following
them
out
of
*NL*
sight
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
reckon
that
's
the
size
o
`
t
,
''
said
Coggan
,
working
along
without
*NL*
looking
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
better
wed
over
the
mixen
than
over
the
moor
,
''
said
Laban
*NL*
Tall
,
turning
his
sheep
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henery
Fray
spoke
,
exhibiting
miserable
eyes
at
the
same
time
:
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
see
why
a
maid
should
take
a
husband
when
she
's
bold
enough
*NL*
to
fight
her
own
battles
,
and
do
n't
want
a
home
;
for
't
is
keeping
*NL*
another
woman
out
.
But
let
it
be
,
for
't
is
a
pity
he
and
she
should
*NL*
trouble
two
houses
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
usual
with
decided
characters
,
Bathsheba
invariably
provoked
the
*NL*
criticism
of
individuals
like
Henery
Fray
.
Her
emblazoned
fault
was
*NL*
to
be
too
pronounced
in
her
objections
,
and
not
sufficiently
overt
in
*NL*
her
likings
.
We
learn
that
it
is
not
the
rays
which
bodies
absorb
,
*NL*
but
those
which
they
reject
,
that
give
them
the
colours
they
are
*NL*
known
by
;
and
in
the
same
way
people
are
specialized
by
their
*NL*
dislikes
and
antagonisms
,
whilst
their
goodwill
is
looked
upon
as
no
*NL*
attribute
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henery
continued
in
a
more
complaisant
mood
:
``
I
once
hinted
my
mind
*NL*
to
her
on
a
few
things
,
as
nearly
as
a
battered
frame
dared
to
do
so
*NL*
to
such
a
froward
piece
.
You
all
know
,
neighbours
,
what
a
man
I
be
,
*NL*
and
how
I
come
down
with
my
powerful
words
when
my
pride
is
boiling
*NL*
wi
'
scarn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
,
we
do
,
Henery
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
I
said
,
`
Mistress
Everdene
,
there
's
places
empty
,
and
there
's
*NL*
gifted
men
willing
;
but
the
spite

no

not
the
spite

I
did
n't

the
villainy
of
the
contrarikind

I
said
-LRB-

*NL*
womankind
-RRB-

out

That
was
n't
too
strong
for
her

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Passably
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I

my

*NL*
``
A

proud

You
see
the
artfulness

Why

was
about

baily

*NL*
I
did
n't
put
it
so
plain
that
she
could
understand
my
meaning
,
so
I
*NL*
could
lay
it
on
all
the
stronger
.
That
was
my
depth
!

However

*NL*
let
her
marry

she

Perhaps
't
is
high
time

I
believe
Farmer

Boldwood
kissed
her
behind
the
spear-bed
at
the
sheep-washing

that
I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a

said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah

Henery
,
mildly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
she
told

all

''
said
Oak
,
with
a
pharisaical
*NL*
sense
that
he
was
not
as
other
shearers
in
this
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye
have
a
right
to
believe
it

said
Henery
,
with
dudgeon
;
``
a

true

I

a

the

in

*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
unvarying
custom
in
Weatherbury
to
sink
minor
differences
*NL*
when
the
maltster
had
to
be
pacified
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Weak

Jan
Coggan
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Joseph

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
bent
and
hoary
man
was
satisfied
,
and
so
apparently
was
Henery
*NL*
Fray
.
That
matters
should
continue
pleasant
Maryann
spoke
,
who
,
what
*NL*
with
her
brown
complexion
,
and
the
working
wrapper
of
rusty
linsey
,
*NL*
had
at
present
the
mellow
hue
of
an
old
sketch
in
oils
--
notably
some
*NL*
of
Nicholas
Poussin
's
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
anybody
know
of
a
crooked
man
,
or
a
lame
,
or
any
second-hand
*NL*
fellow
at
all
that
would
do
for
poor
me
?
''
said
Maryann
.
``
A
perfect
*NL*
one
I
do
n't
expect
to
get
at
my
time
of
life
.
If
I
could
hear
of
*NL*
such
a
thing
twould
do
me
more
good
than
toast
and
ale
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Coggan
furnished
a
suitable
reply
.
Oak
went
on
with
his
shearing
,
*NL*
and
said
not
another
word
.
Pestilent
moods
had
come
,
and
teased
*NL*
away
his
quiet
.
Bathsheba
had
shown
indications
of
anointing
him
*NL*
above
his
fellows
by
installing
him
as
the
bailiff
that
the
farm
*NL*
imperatively
required
.
He
did
not
covet
the
post
relatively
to
the
*NL*
farm
:
in
relation
to
herself
,
as
beloved
by
him
and
unmarried
to
*NL*
another
,
he
had
coveted
it
.
His
readings
of
her
seemed
now
to
be
*NL*
vapoury
and
indistinct
.
His
lecture
to
her
was
,
he
thought
,
one
of
*NL*
the
absurdest
mistakes
.
Far
from
coquetting
with
Boldwood
,
she
had
*NL*
trifled
with
himself
in
thus
feigning
that
she
had
trifled
with
*NL*
another
.
He
was
inwardly
convinced
that
,
in
accordance
with
the
*NL*
anticipations
of
his
easy-going
and
worse-educated
comrades
,
that
day
*NL*
would
see
Boldwood
the
accepted
husband
of
Miss
Everdene
.
Gabriel
*NL*
at
this
time
of
his
life
had
out-grown
the
instinctive
dislike
which
*NL*
every
Christian
boy
has
for
reading
the
Bible
,
perusing
it
now
*NL*
quite
frequently
,
and
he
inwardly
said
,
''
'
I
find
more
bitter
than
*NL*
death
the
woman
whose
heart
is
snares
and
nets
!
'
''
This
was
mere
*NL*
exclamation
--
the
froth
of
the
storm
.
He
adored
Bathsheba
just
the
*NL*
same
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
workfolk
shall
have
some
lordly
junketing
to-night
,
''
said
Cainy
*NL*
Ball
,
casting
forth
his
thoughts
in
a
new
direction
.
``
This
morning
I
*NL*
see
'em
making
the
great
puddens
in
the
milking-pails
--
lumps
of
fat
*NL*
as
big
as
yer
thumb
,
Mister
Oak
!
I
've
never
seed
such
splendid
large
*NL*
knobs
of
fat
before
in
the
days
of
my
life
--
they
never
used
to
be
*NL*
bigger
then
a
horse-bean
.
And
there
was
a
great
black
crock
upon
the
*NL*
brandish
with
his
legs
a-sticking
out
,
but
I
do
n't
know
what
was
in
*NL*
within
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
there
's
two
bushels
of
biffins
for
apple-pies
,
''
said
Maryann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
to
do
my
duty
by
it
all
,
''
said
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
in
a
*NL*
pleasant
,
masticating
manner
of
anticipation
.
``
Yes
;
victuals
and
*NL*
drink
is
a
cheerful
thing
,
and
gives
nerves
to
the
nerveless
,
if
the
*NL*
form
of
words
may
be
used
.
'T
is
the
gospel
of
the
body
,
without
*NL*
which
we
perish

so
to
speak
it

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
EVENTIDE
--
A
SECOND
DECLARATION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
shearing-supper
a
long
table
was
placed
on
the
grass-plot
*NL*
beside
the
house
,
the
end
of
the
table
being
thrust
over
the
sill
*NL*
of
the
wide
parlour
window
and
a
foot
or
two
into
the
room
.
Miss
*NL*
Everdene
sat
inside
the
window
,
facing
down
the
table
.
She
was
*NL*
thus
at
the
head
without
mingling
with
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
evening
Bathsheba
was
unusually
excited
,
her
red
cheeks
and
lips
*NL*
contrasting
lustrously
with
the
mazy
skeins
of
her
shadowy
hair
.
She
*NL*
seemed
to
expect
assistance
,
and
the
seat
at
the
bottom
of
the
table
*NL*
was
at
her
request
left
vacant
until
after
they
had
begun
the
meal
.
*NL*
She
then
asked
Gabriel
to
take
the
place
and
the
duties
appertaining
*NL*
to
that
end
,
which
he
did
with
great
readiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
Mr.
Boldwood
came
in
at
the
gate
,
and
crossed
the
*NL*
green
to
Bathsheba
at
the
window
.
He
apologized
for
his
lateness
:
*NL*
his
arrival
was
evidently
by
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
,
''
said
she
,
``
will
you
move
again
,
please
,
and
let
Mr.
*NL*
Boldwood
come
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
moved
in
silence
back
to
his
original
seat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentleman-farmer
was
dressed
in
cheerful
style
,
in
a
new
coat
*NL*
and
white
waistcoat
,
quite
contrasting
with
his
usual
sober
suits
of
*NL*
grey
.
Inwardy
,
too
,
he
was
blithe
,
and
consequently
chatty
to
an
*NL*
exceptional
degree
.
So
also
was
Bathsheba
now
that
he
had
come
,
*NL*
though
the
uninvited
presence
of
Pennyways
,
the
bailiff
who
had
been
*NL*
dismissed
for
theft
,
disturbed
her
equanimity
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
Supper
being
ended
,
Coggan
began
on
his
own
private
account
,
without
*NL*
reference
to
listeners
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
've
lost
my
love
,
and
I
care
not
,
*NL*
I
've
lost
my
love
,
and
I
care
not
;
*NL*
I
shall
soon
have
another
*NL*
That
's
better
than
t
`
other
;
*NL*
I
've
lost
my
love
,
and
I
care
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
This
lyric
,
when
concluded
,
was
received
with
a
silently
appreciative
*NL*
gaze
at
the
table
,
implying
that
the
performance
,
like
a
work
by
*NL*
those
established
authors
who
are
independent
of
notices
in
the
*NL*
papers
,
was
a
well-known
delight
which
required
no
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Master
Poorgrass
,
your
song
!
''
said
Coggan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
be
all
but
in
liquor
,
and
the
gift
is
wanting
in
me
,
''
said
Joseph
,
*NL*
diminishing
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense
;
wou
`
st
never
be
so
ungrateful
,
Joseph
--
never
!
''
said
*NL*
Coggan
,
expressing
hurt
feelings
by
an
inflection
of
voice
.
``
And
*NL*
mistress
is
looking
hard
at
ye

as
much

``

``

Joseph
,
differently
;
``
but
if
so
be
't
is
willed
*NL*
they
do
,
they
must
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Joseph
,
your
song
,
please

''
said
Bathsheba
,
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
really
,
ma'am
,
''
he
replied
,
in
a
yielding
tone
,
``
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
to
say
.
It
would
be
a
poor
plain
ballet
of
my
own
composure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
,
hear
!
''
said
the
supper-party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poorgrass
,
thus
assured
,
trilled
forth
a
flickering
yet
commendable
*NL*
piece
of
sentiment
,
the
tune
of
which
consisted
of
the
key-note
and
*NL*
another
,
the
latter
being
the
sound
chiefly
dwelt
upon
.
This
was
so
*NL*
successful
that
he
rashly
plunged
into
a
second
in
the
same
breath
,
*NL*
after
a
few
false
starts
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
said
Coggan
,
at
the
end
of
the
verse
.
''
`
They
*NL*

was
a
very
taking
paragraph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
;
and
there
was
a
pretty
place
at

'
and
't
was
well
*NL*
heaved
out
.
Though
`
love
'
is
a
nasty
high
corner
when
a
man
's
voice
*NL*
is
getting
crazed
.
Next
verse
,
Master
Poorgrass

''
*NL*
*NL*
But
during
this
rendering
young
Bob
Coggan
exhibited
one
of
those
*NL*
anomalies
which
will
afflict
little
people
when
other
persons
are
*NL*
particularly
serious
:
in
trying
to
check
his
laughter
,
he
pushed
down
*NL*
his
throat
as
much
of
the
tablecloth
as
he
could
get
hold
of
,
when
,
*NL*
after
continuing
hermetically
sealed
for
a
short
time
,
his
mirth
*NL*
burst
out
through
his
nose
.
Joseph
perceived
it
,
and
with
hectic
*NL*
cheeks
of
indignation
instantly
ceased
singing
.
Coggan
boxed
Bob
's
*NL*
ears
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
,
Joseph
--
go
on
,
and
never
mind
the
young
scamp
,
''
said
Coggan
.
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
very
catching
ballet
.
Now
then
again
--
the
next
bar
;
I
'll
*NL*
help
ye
to
flourish
up
the
shrill
notes
where
yer
wind
is
rather
*NL*
wheezy
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
the

,
*NL*
And

'
tre

'
-
ill

'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
singer
could
not
be
set
going
again
.
Bob
Coggan
was
sent
*NL*
home
for
his
ill
manners
,
and
tranquility
was
restored
by
Jacob
*NL*
Smallbury
,
who
volunteered
a
ballad
as
inclusive
and
interminable
*NL*
as
that
with
which
the
worthy
toper
old
Silenus
amused
on
a
similar
*NL*
occasion
the
swains
Chromis
and
Mnasylus
,
and
other
jolly
dogs
of
*NL*
his
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
still
the
beaming
time
of
evening
,
though
night
was
stealthily
*NL*
making
itself
visible
low
down
upon
the
ground
,
the
western
lines
of
*NL*
light
raking
the
earth
without
alighting
upon
it
to
any
extent
,
or
*NL*
illuminating
the
dead
levels
at
all
.
The
sun
had
crept
round
the
*NL*
tree
as
a
last
effort
before
death
,
and
then
began
to
sink
,
the
*NL*
shearers
'
lower
parts
becoming
steeped
in
embrowning
twilight
,
whilst
*NL*
their
heads
and
shoulders
were
still
enjoying
day
,
touched
with
a
*NL*
yellow
of
self-sustained
brilliancy
that
seemed
inherent
rather
than
*NL*
acquired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
went
down
in
an
ochreous
mist
;
but
they
sat
,
and
talked
on
,
*NL*
and
grew
as
merry
as
the
gods
in
Homer
's
heaven
.
Bathsheba
still
*NL*
remained
enthroned
inside
the
window
,
and
occupied
herself
in
*NL*
knitting
,
from
which
she
sometimes
looked
up
to
view
the
fading
scene
*NL*
outside
.
The
slow
twilight
expanded
and
enveloped
them
completely
*NL*
before
the
signs
of
moving
were
shown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
suddenly
missed
Farmer
Boldwood
from
his
place
at
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
table
.
How
long
he
had
been
gone
Oak
did
not
know
;
but
he
*NL*
had
apparently
withdrawn
into
the
encircling
dusk
.
Whilst
he
was
*NL*
thinking
of
this
,
Liddy
brought
candles
into
the
back
part
of
the
*NL*
room
overlooking
the
shearers
,
and
their
lively
new
flames
shone
down
*NL*
the
table
and
over
the
men
,
and
dispersed
among
the
green
shadows
*NL*
behind
.
Bathsheba
's
form
,
still
in
its
original
position
,
was
now
*NL*
again
distinct
between
their
eyes
and
the
light
,
which
revealed
that
*NL*
Boldwood
had
gone
inside
the
room
,
and
was
sitting
near
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
came
the
question
of
the
evening
.
Would
Miss
Everdene
sing
to
*NL*
them
the
song
she
always
sang
so
charmingly
--
``
The
Banks
of
Allan
*NL*
Water
''
--
before
they
went
home
?
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
consideration
Bathsheba
assented
,
beckoning
to
*NL*
Gabriel
,
who
hastened
up
into
the
coveted
atmosphere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
brought
your
flute
?
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Play
to
my
singing
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
up
in
the
window-opening
,
facing
the
men
,
the
candles
*NL*
behind
her
,
Gabriel
on
her
right
hand
,
immediately
outside
the
*NL*
sash-frame
.
Boldwood
had
drawn
up
on
her
left
,
within
the
room
.
*NL*
Her
singing
was
soft
and
rather
tremulous
at
first
,
but
it
soon
*NL*
swelled
to
a
steady
clearness
.
Subsequent
events
caused
one
of
the
*NL*
verses
to
be
remembered
for
many
months
,
and
even
years
,
by
more
*NL*
than
one
of
those
who
were
gathered
there
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
his
bride
a
soldier
sought
her
,
*NL*
And
a
winning
tongue
had
he
:
*NL*
On
the
banks
of
Allan
Water
*NL*
None
was
gay
as
she
!
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
addition
to
the
dulcet
piping
of
Gabriel
's
flute
,
Boldwood
*NL*
supplied
a
bass
in
his
customary
profound
voice
,
uttering
his
notes
*NL*
so
softly
,
however
,
as
to
abstain
entirely
from
making
anything
like
*NL*
an
ordinary
duet
of
the
song
;
they
rather
formed
a
rich
unexplored
*NL*
shadow
,
which
threw
her
tones
into
relief
.
The
shearers
reclined
*NL*
against
each
other
as
at
suppers
in
the
early
ages
of
the
world
,
and
*NL*
so
silent
and
absorbed
were
they
that
her
breathing
could
almost
be
*NL*
heard
between
the
bars
;
and
at
the
end
of
the
ballad
,
when
the
last
*NL*
tone
loitered
on
to
an
inexpressible
close
,
there
arose
that
buzz
of
*NL*
pleasure
which
is
the
attar
of
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
scarcely
necessary
to
state
that
Gabriel
could
not
avoid
noting
*NL*
the
farmer
's
bearing
to-night
towards
their
entertainer
.
Yet
there
*NL*
was
nothing
exceptional
in
his
actions
beyond
what
appertained
to
*NL*
his
time
of
performing
them
.
It
was
when
the
rest
were
all
looking
*NL*
away
that
Boldwood
observed
her
;
when
they
regarded
her
he
turned
*NL*
aside
;
when
they
thanked
or
praised
he
was
silent
;
when
they
*NL*
were
inattentive
he
murmured
his
thanks
.
The
meaning
lay
in
the
*NL*
difference
between
actions
,
none
of
which
had
any
meaning
of
itself
;
*NL*
and
the
necessity
of
being
jealous
,
which
lovers
are
troubled
with
,
*NL*
did
not
lead
Oak
to
underestimate
these
signs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
then
wished
them
good-night
,
withdrew
from
the
window
,
and
*NL*
retired
to
the
back
part
of
the
room
,
Boldwood
thereupon
closing
the
*NL*
sash
and
the
shutters
,
and
remaining
inside
with
her
.
Oak
wandered
*NL*
away
under
the
quiet
and
scented
trees
.
Recovering
from
the
softer
*NL*
impressions
produced
by
Bathsheba
's
voice
,
the
shearers
rose
to
*NL*
leave
,
Coggan
turning
to
Pennyways
as
he
pushed
back
the
bench
to
*NL*
pass
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
to
give
praise
where
praise
is
due
,
and
the
man
deserves
*NL*
it
--
that
'
a
do
so
,
''
he
remarked
,
looking
at
the
worthy
thief
,
as
if
*NL*
he
were
the
masterpiece
of
some
world-renowned
artist
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
should
never
have
believed
it
if
we
had
n't
proved
it
,
so
*NL*
to
allude
,
''
hiccupped
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
``
that
every
cup
,
every
one
of
*NL*
the
best
knives
and
forks
,
and
every
empty
bottle
be
in
their
place
*NL*
as
perfect
now
as
at
the
beginning
,
and
not
one
stole
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
deserve
half
the
praise
you
give
me
,
''
said
the
*NL*
virtuous
thief
,
grimly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
say
this
for
Pennyways
,
''
added
Coggan
,
``
that
whenever
he
*NL*
do
really
make
up
his
mind
to
do
a
noble
thing
in
the
shape
of
a
good
*NL*
action
,
as
I
could
see
by
his
face
he
did
to-night
afore
sitting
*NL*
down
,
he
's
generally
able
to
carry
it
out
.
Yes
,
I
'm
proud
to
say
,
*NL*
neighbours
,
that
he
's
stole
nothing
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
't
is
an
honest
deed
,
and
we
thank
ye
for
it
,
Pennyways
,
''
said
*NL*
Joseph
;
to
which
opinion
the
remainder
of
the
company
subscribed
*NL*
unanimously
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
of
departure
,
when
nothing
more
was
visible
of
the
*NL*
inside
of
the
parlour
than
a
thin
and
still
chink
of
light
between
*NL*
the
shutters
,
a
passionate
scene
was
in
course
of
enactment
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Everdene
and
Boldwood
were
alone
.
Her
cheeks
had
lost
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
their
healthful
fire
from
the
very
seriousness
of
*NL*
her
position
;
but
her
eye
was
bright
with
the
excitement
of
a
*NL*
triumph
--
though
it
was
a
triumph
which
had
rather
been
contemplated
*NL*
than
desired
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
standing
behind
a
low
arm-chair
,
from
which
she
had
just
*NL*
risen
,
and
he
was
kneeling
in
it
--
inclining
himself
over
its
back
*NL*
towards
her
,
and
holding
her
hand
in
both
his
own
.
His
body
moved
*NL*
restlessly
,
and
it
was
with
what
Keats
daintily
calls
a
too
happy
*NL*
happiness
.
This
unwonted
abstraction
by
love
of
all
dignity
from
*NL*
a
man
of
whom
it
had
ever
seemed
the
chief
component
,
was
,
in
its
*NL*
distressing
incongruity
,
a
pain
to
her
which
quenched
much
of
the
*NL*
pleasure
she
derived
from
the
proof
that
she
was
idolized
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
try
to
love
you
,
''
she
was
saying
,
in
a
trembling
voice
quite
*NL*
unlike
her
usual
self-confidence
.
``
And
if
I
can
believe
in
any
way
*NL*
that
I
shall
make
you
a
good
wife
I
shall
indeed
be
willing
to
marry
*NL*
you
.
But
,
Mr.
Boldwood
,
hesitation
on
so
high
a
matter
is
honourable
*NL*
in
any
woman
,
and
I
do
n't
want
to
give
a
solemn
promise
to-night
.
I
*NL*
would
rather
ask
you
to
wait
a
few
weeks
till
I
can
see
my
situation
*NL*
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
THEN
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
every
reason
to
hope
that
at
the
end
of
the
five
or
six
*NL*
weeks
,
between
this
time
and
harvest
,
that
you
say
you
are
going
to
*NL*
be
away
from
home
,
I
shall
be
able
to
promise
to
be
your
wife
,
''
she
*NL*
said
,
firmly
.
``
But
remember
this
distinctly
,
I
do
n't
promise
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
enough
;
I
do
n't
ask
more
.
I
can
wait
on
those
dear
words
.
*NL*
And
now
,
Miss
Everdene
,
good-night
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
''
she
said
,
graciously
--
almost
tenderly
;
and
Boldwood
*NL*
withdrew
with
a
serene
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
knew
more
of
him
now
;
he
had
entirely
bared
his
heart
*NL*
before
her
,
even
until
he
had
almost
worn
in
her
eyes
the
sorry
look
*NL*
of
a
grand
bird
without
the
feathers
that
make
it
grand
.
She
had
*NL*
been
awe-struck
at
her
past
temerity
,
and
was
struggling
to
make
*NL*
amends
without
thinking
whether
the
sin
quite
deserved
the
penalty
*NL*
she
was
schooling
herself
to
pay
.
To
have
brought
all
this
about
her
*NL*
ears
was
terrible
;
but
after
a
while
the
situation
was
not
without
*NL*
a
fearful
joy
.
The
facility
with
which
even
the
most
timid
women
*NL*
sometimes
acquire
a
relish
for
the
dreadful
when
that
is
amalgamated
*NL*
with
a
little
triumph
,
is
marvellous
.

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
SAME
NIGHT
--
THE
FIR
PLANTATION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Among
the
multifarious
duties
which
Bathsheba
had
voluntarily
imposed
*NL*
upon
herself
by
dispensing
with
the
services
of
a
bailiff
,
was
the
*NL*
particular
one
of
looking
round
the
homestead
before
going
to
bed
,
*NL*
to
see
that
all
was
right
and
safe
for
the
night
.
Gabriel
had
*NL*
almost
constantly
preceded
her
in
this
tour
every
evening
,
watching
*NL*
her
affairs
as
carefully
as
any
specially
appointed
officer
of
*NL*
surveillance
could
have
done
;
but
this
tender
devotion
was
to
a
*NL*
great
extent
unknown
to
his
mistress
,
and
as
much
as
was
known
was
*NL*
somewhat
thanklessly
received
.
Women
are
never
tired
of
bewailing
*NL*
man
's
fickleness
in
love
,
but
they
only
seem
to
snub
his
constancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
watching
is
best
done
invisibly
,
she
usually
carried
a
dark
*NL*
lantern
in
her
hand
,
and
every
now
and
then
turned
on
the
light
*NL*
to
examine
nooks
and
corners
with
the
coolness
of
a
metropolitan
*NL*
policeman
.
This
coolness
may
have
owed
its
existence
not
so
much
*NL*
to
her
fearlessness
of
expected
danger
as
to
her
freedom
from
the
*NL*
suspicion
of
any
;
her
worst
anticipated
discovery
being
that
a
horse
*NL*
might
not
be
well
bedded
,
the
fowls
not
all
in
,
or
a
door
not
closed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
night
the
buildings
were
inspected
as
usual
,
and
she
went
round
*NL*
to
the
farm
paddock
.
Here
the
only
sounds
disturbing
the
stillness
*NL*
were
steady
munchings
of
many
mouths
,
and
stentorian
breathings
from
*NL*
all
but
invisible
noses
,
ending
in
snores
and
puffs
like
the
blowing
*NL*
of
bellows
slowly
.
Then
the
munching
would
recommence
,
when
the
*NL*
lively
imagination
might
assist
the
eye
to
discern
a
group
of
*NL*
pink-white
nostrils
,
shaped
as
caverns
,
and
very
clammy
and
humid
on
*NL*
their
surfaces
,
not
exactly
pleasant
to
the
touch
until
one
got
used
*NL*
to
them
;
the
mouths
beneath
having
a
great
partiality
for
closing
*NL*
upon
any
loose
end
of
Bathsheba
's
apparel
which
came
within
reach
of
*NL*
their
tongues
.
Above
each
of
these
a
still
keener
vision
suggested
a
*NL*
brown
forehead
and
two
staring
though
not
unfriendly
eyes
,
and
above
*NL*
all
a
pair
of
whitish
crescent-shaped
horns
like
two
particularly
*NL*
new
moons
,
an
occasional
stolid
``
moo
!
''
proclaiming
beyond
the
shade
*NL*
of
a
doubt
that
these
phenomena
were
the
features
and
persons
of
*NL*
Daisy
,
Whitefoot
,
Bonny-lass
,
Jolly-O
,
Spot
,
Twinkle-eye
,
etc.
,
*NL*
etc.
--
the
respectable
dairy
of
Devon
cows
belonging
to
Bathsheba
*NL*
aforesaid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
way
back
to
the
house
was
by
a
path
through
a
young
plantation
of
*NL*
tapering
firs
,
which
had
been
planted
some
years
earlier
to
shelter
*NL*
the
premises
from
the
north
wind
.
By
reason
of
the
density
of
*NL*
the
interwoven
foliage
overhead
,
it
was
gloomy
there
at
cloudless
*NL*
noontide
,
twilight
in
the
evening
,
dark
as
midnight
at
dusk
,
and
*NL*
black
as
the
ninth
plague
of
Egypt
at
midnight
.
To
describe
the
spot
*NL*
is
to
call
it
a
vast
,
low
,
naturally
formed
hall
,
the
plumy
ceiling
*NL*
of
which
was
supported
by
slender
pillars
of
living
wood
,
the
floor
*NL*
being
covered
with
a
soft
dun
carpet
of
dead
spikelets
and
mildewed
*NL*
cones
,
with
a
tuft
of
grass-blades
here
and
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
bit
of
the
path
was
always
the
crux
of
the
night
's
ramble
,
*NL*
though
,
before
starting
,
her
apprehensions
of
danger
were
not
vivid
*NL*
enough
to
lead
her
to
take
a
companion
.
Slipping
along
here
covertly
*NL*
as
Time
,
Bathsheba
fancied
she
could
hear
footsteps
entering
the
*NL*
track
at
the
opposite
end
.
It
was
certainly
a
rustle
of
footsteps
.
*NL*
Her
own
instantly
fell
as
gently
as
snowflakes
.
She
reassured
*NL*
herself
by
a
remembrance
that
the
path
was
public
,
and
that
the
*NL*
traveller
was
probably
some
villager
returning
home
;
regretting
,
*NL*
at
the
same
time
,
that
the
meeting
should
be
about
to
occur
in
the
*NL*
darkest
point
of
her
route
,
even
though
only
just
outside
her
own
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
approached
,
came
close
,
and
a
figure
was
apparently
on
the
*NL*
point
of
gliding
past
her
when
something
tugged
at
her
skirt
and
*NL*
pinned
it
forcibly
to
the
ground
.
The
instantaneous
check
nearly
*NL*
threw
Bathsheba
off
her
balance
.
In
recovering
she
struck
against
*NL*
warm
clothes
and
buttons
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rum
start
,
upon
my
soul
!
''
said
a
masculine
voice
,
a
foot
or
so
*NL*
above
her
head
.
``
Have
I
hurt
you
,
mate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
attempting
to
shrink
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
got
hitched
together
somehow
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
a
woman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
lady
,
I
should
have
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
does
n't
matter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
softly
tugged
again
,
but
to
no
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
a
dark
lantern
you
have
?
I
fancy
so
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
allow
me
I
'll
open
it
,
and
set
you
free
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
hand
seized
the
lantern
,
the
door
was
opened
,
the
rays
burst
*NL*
out
from
their
prison
,
and
Bathsheba
beheld
her
position
with
*NL*
astonishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
to
whom
she
was
hooked
was
brilliant
in
brass
and
scarlet
.
*NL*
He
was
a
soldier
.
His
sudden
appearance
was
to
darkness
what
the
*NL*
sound
of
a
trumpet
is
to
silence
.
Gloom
,
the
_
genius
loci
_
at
all
*NL*
times
hitherto
,
was
now
totally
overthrown
,
less
by
the
lantern-light
*NL*
than
by
what
the
lantern
lighted
.
The
contrast
of
this
revelation
*NL*
with
her
anticipations
of
some
sinister
figure
in
sombre
garb
was
so
*NL*
great
that
it
had
upon
her
the
effect
of
a
fairy
transformation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
immediately
apparent
that
the
military
man
's
spur
had
become
*NL*
entangled
in
the
gimp
which
decorated
the
skirt
of
her
dress
.
He
*NL*
caught
a
view
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
unfasten
you
in
one
moment
,
miss
,
''
he
said
,
with
new-born
*NL*
gallantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
I
can
do
it
,
thank
you
,
''
she
hastily
replied
,
and
stooped
for
*NL*
the
performance
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
unfastening
was
not
such
a
trifling
affair
.
The
rowel
of
the
*NL*
spur
had
so
wound
itself
among
the
gimp
cords
in
those
few
moments
,
*NL*
that
separation
was
likely
to
be
a
matter
of
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
too
stooped
,
and
the
lantern
standing
on
the
ground
betwixt
them
*NL*
threw
the
gleam
from
its
open
side
among
the
fir-tree
needles
and
the
*NL*
blades
of
long
damp
grass
with
the
effect
of
a
large
glowworm
.
It
*NL*
radiated
upwards
into
their
faces
,
and
sent
over
half
the
plantation
*NL*
gigantic
shadows
of
both
man
and
woman
,
each
dusky
shape
becoming
*NL*
distorted
and
mangled
upon
the
tree-trunks
till
it
wasted
to
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
hard
into
her
eyes
when
she
raised
them
for
a
moment
;
*NL*
Bathsheba
looked
down
again
,
for
his
gaze
was
too
strong
to
be
*NL*
received
point-blank
with
her
own
.
But
she
had
obliquely
noticed
*NL*
that
he
was
young
and
slim
,
and
that
he
wore
three
chevrons
upon
his
*NL*
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
pulled
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
prisoner
,
miss
;
it
is
no
use
blinking
the
matter
,
''
said
*NL*
the
soldier
,
drily
.
``
I
must
cut
your
dress
if
you
are
in
such
a
*NL*
hurry
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
please
do
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
helplessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
n't
be
necessary
if
you
could
wait
a
moment
,
''
and
he
unwound
*NL*
a
cord
from
the
little
wheel
.
She
withdrew
her
own
hand
,
but
,
*NL*
whether
by
accident
or
design
,
he
touched
it
.
Bathsheba
was
vexed
;
*NL*
she
hardly
knew
why
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
unravelling
went
on
,
but
it
nevertheless
seemed
coming
to
no
end
.
*NL*
She
looked
at
him
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
for
the
sight
of
such
a
beautiful
face
!
''
said
the
young
*NL*
sergeant
,
without
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
coloured
with
embarrassment
.
''
'T
was
unwillingly
shown
,
''
she
*NL*
replied
,
stiffly
,
and
with
as
much
dignity
--
which
was
very
little
--
as
*NL*
she
could
infuse
into
a
position
of
captivity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
you
the
better
for
that
incivility
,
miss
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
liked
--
I
wish
--
you
had
never
shown
yourself
to
me
by
*NL*
intruding
here
!
''
She
pulled
again
,
and
the
gathers
of
her
dress
began
*NL*
to
give
way
like
liliputian
musketry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
deserve
the
chastisement
your
words
give
me
.
But
why
should
such
*NL*
a
fair
and
dutiful
girl
have
such
an
aversion
to
her
father
's
sex
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
on
your
way
,
please
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Beauty
,
and
drag
you
after
me
?
Do
but
look
;
I
never
saw
such
*NL*
a
tangle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
't
is
shameful
of
you
;
you
have
been
making
it
worse
on
purpose
*NL*
to
keep
me
here
--
you
have
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
do
n't
think
so
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
with
a
merry
twinkle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
you
have
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
in
high
temper
.
``
I
insist
upon
*NL*
undoing
it
.
Now
,
allow
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
miss
;
I
am
not
of
steel
.
''
He
added
a
sigh
which
had
as
*NL*
much
archness
in
it
as
a
sigh
could
possess
without
losing
its
nature
*NL*
altogether
.
``
I
am
thankful
for
beauty
,
even
when
't
is
thrown
to
me
*NL*
like
a
bone
to
a
dog
.
These
moments
will
be
over
too
soon
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
closed
her
lips
in
a
determined
silence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
revolving
in
her
mind
whether
by
a
bold
and
desperate
*NL*
rush
she
could
free
herself
at
the
risk
of
leaving
her
skirt
bodily
*NL*
behind
her
.
The
thought
was
too
dreadful
.
The
dress
--
which
she
had
*NL*
put
on
to
appear
stately
at
the
supper
--
was
the
head
and
front
of
her
*NL*
wardrobe
;
not
another
in
her
stock
became
her
so
well
.
What
woman
*NL*
in
Bathsheba
's
position
,
not
naturally
timid
,
and
within
call
of
her
*NL*
retainers
,
would
have
bought
escape
from
a
dashing
soldier
at
so
dear
*NL*
a
price
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
in
good
time
;
it
will
soon
be
done
,
I
perceive
,
''
said
her
cool
*NL*
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
trifling
provokes
,
and
--
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
too
cruel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Insults
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
done
in
order
that
I
may
have
the
pleasure
of
apologizing
to
*NL*
so
charming
a
woman
,
which
I
straightway
do
most
humbly
,
madam
,
''
he
*NL*
said
,
bowing
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
really
knew
not
what
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
seen
a
good
many
women
in
my
time
,
''
continued
the
young
man
in
*NL*
a
murmur
,
and
more
thoughtfully
than
hitherto
,
critically
regarding
*NL*
her
bent
head
at
the
same
time
;
``
but
I
've
never
seen
a
woman
so
*NL*
beautiful
as
you
.
Take
it
or
leave
it
--
be
offended
or
like
it
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
care
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
,
then
,
who
can
so
well
afford
to
despise
opinion
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
stranger
.
Sergeant
Troy
.
I
am
staying
in
this
place
.
--
There
!
*NL*
it
is
undone
at
last
,
you
see
.
Your
light
fingers
were
more
eager
*NL*
than
mine
.
I
wish
it
had
been
the
knot
of
knots
,
which
there
's
no
*NL*
untying
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
worse
and
worse
.
She
started
up
,
and
so
did
he
.
How
to
*NL*
decently
get
away
from
him
--
that
was
her
difficulty
now
.
She
sidled
*NL*
off
inch
by
inch
,
the
lantern
in
her
hand
,
till
she
could
see
the
*NL*
redness
of
his
coat
no
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Beauty
;
good-bye
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
reply
,
and
,
reaching
a
distance
of
twenty
or
thirty
*NL*
yards
,
turned
about
,
and
ran
indoors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
had
just
retired
to
rest
.
In
ascending
to
her
own
chamber
,
*NL*
Bathsheba
opened
the
girl
's
door
an
inch
or
two
,
and
,
panting
,
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liddy
,
is
any
soldier
staying
in
the
village
--
sergeant
somebody
--
*NL*
rather
gentlemanly
for
a
sergeant
,
and
good
looking
--
a
red
coat
with
*NL*
blue
facings
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
miss
...
No
,
I
say
;
but
really
it
might
be
Sergeant
Troy
home
on
*NL*
furlough
,
though
I
have
not
seen
him
.
He
was
here
once
in
that
way
*NL*
when
the
regiment
was
at
Casterbridge
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
the
name
.
Had
he
a
moustache
--
no
whiskers
or
beard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
had
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
kind
of
a
person
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
miss
--
I
blush
to
name
it
--
a
gay
man
!
But
I
know
him
to
be
very
*NL*
quick
and
trim
,
who
might
have
made
his
thousands
,
like
a
squire
.
*NL*
Such
a
clever
young
dandy
as
he
is
!
He
's
a
doctor
's
son
by
name
,
*NL*
which
is
a
great
deal
;
and
he
's
an
earl
's
son
by
nature
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
a
great
deal
more
.
Fancy
!
Is
it
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

And
,
he
was
brought
up
so
well
,
and
sent
to
Casterbridge
*NL*
Grammar
School
for
years
and
years
.
Learnt
all
languages
while
he
*NL*
was
there
;
and
it
was
said
he
got
on
so
far
that
he
could
take
down
*NL*
Chinese
in
shorthand
;
but
that
I
do
n't
answer
for
,
as
it
was
only
*NL*
reported
.
However
,
he
wasted
his
gifted
lot
,
and
listed
a
soldier
;
*NL*
but
even
then
he
rose
to
be
a
sergeant
without
trying
at
all
.
Ah
!
*NL*
such
a
blessing
it
is
to
be
high-born
;
nobility
of
blood
will
shine
*NL*
out
even
in
the
ranks
and
files
.
And
is
he
really
come
home
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
so
.
Good-night
,
Liddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
all
,
how
could
a
cheerful
wearer
of
skirts
be
permanently
*NL*
offended
with
the
man
?
There
are
occasions
when
girls
like
Bathsheba
*NL*
will
put
up
with
a
great
deal
of
unconventional
behaviour
.
When
they
*NL*
want
to
be
praised
,
which
is
often
,
when
they
want
to
be
mastered
,
*NL*
which
is
sometimes
;
and
when
they
want
no
nonsense
,
which
is
seldom
.
*NL*
Just
now
the
first
feeling
was
in
the
ascendant
with
Bathsheba
,
*NL*
with
a
dash
of
the
second
.
Moreover
,
by
chance
or
by
devilry
,
the
*NL*
ministrant
was
antecedently
made
interesting
by
being
a
handsome
*NL*
stranger
who
had
evidently
seen
better
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
could
not
clearly
decide
whether
it
was
her
opinion
that
he
*NL*
had
insulted
her
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
ever
anything
so
odd
!
''
she
at
last
exclaimed
to
herself
,
in
her
*NL*
own
room
.
``
And
was
ever
anything
so
meanly
done
as
what
I
did
--
to
*NL*
skulk
away
like
that
from
a
man
who
was
only
civil
and
kind
!
''
Clearly
*NL*
she
did
not
think
his
barefaced
praise
of
her
person
an
insult
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
fatal
omission
of
Boldwood
's
that
he
had
never
once
told
her
*NL*
she
was
beautiful
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
NEW
ACQUAINTANCE
DESCRIBED
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Idiosyncrasy
and
vicissitude
had
combined
to
stamp
Sergeant
Troy
as
*NL*
an
exceptional
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
man
to
whom
memories
were
an
incumbrance
,
and
anticipations
*NL*
a
superfluity
.
Simply
feeling
,
considering
,
and
caring
for
what
was
*NL*
before
his
eyes
,
he
was
vulnerable
only
in
the
present
.
His
outlook
*NL*
upon
time
was
as
a
transient
flash
of
the
eye
now
and
then
:
that
*NL*
projection
of
consciousness
into
days
gone
by
and
to
come
,
which
*NL*
makes
the
past
a
synonym
for
the
pathetic
and
the
future
a
word
*NL*
for
circumspection
,
was
foreign
to
Troy
.
With
him
the
past
was
*NL*
yesterday
;
the
future
,
to-morrow
;
never
,
the
day
after
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
account
he
might
,
in
certain
lights
,
have
been
regarded
as
*NL*
one
of
the
most
fortunate
of
his
order
.
For
it
may
be
argued
with
*NL*
great
plausibility
that
reminiscence
is
less
an
endowment
than
a
*NL*
disease
,
and
that
expectation
in
its
only
comfortable
form
--
that
of
*NL*
absolute
faith
--
is
practically
an
impossibility
;
whilst
in
the
form
*NL*
of
hope
and
the
secondary
compounds
,
patience
,
impatience
,
resolve
,
*NL*
curiosity
,
it
is
a
constant
fluctuation
between
pleasure
and
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sergeant
Troy
,
being
entirely
innocent
of
the
practice
of
*NL*
expectation
,
was
never
disappointed
.
To
set
against
this
negative
*NL*
gain
there
may
have
been
some
positive
losses
from
a
certain
*NL*
narrowing
of
the
higher
tastes
and
sensations
which
it
entailed
.
But
*NL*
limitation
of
the
capacity
is
never
recognized
as
a
loss
by
the
loser
*NL*
therefrom
:
in
this
attribute
moral
or
aesthetic
poverty
contrasts
*NL*
plausibly
with
material
,
since
those
who
suffer
do
not
mind
it
,
*NL*
whilst
those
who
mind
it
soon
cease
to
suffer
.
It
is
not
a
denial
*NL*
of
anything
to
have
been
always
without
it
,
and
what
Troy
had
never
*NL*
enjoyed
he
did
not
miss
;
but
,
being
fully
conscious
that
what
sober
*NL*
people
missed
he
enjoyed
,
his
capacity
,
though
really
less
,
seemed
*NL*
greater
than
theirs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
moderately
truthful
towards
men
,
but
to
women
lied
like
*NL*
a
Cretan
--
a
system
of
ethics
above
all
others
calculated
to
win
*NL*
popularity
at
the
first
flush
of
admission
into
lively
society
;
and
*NL*
the
possibility
of
the
favour
gained
being
transitory
had
reference
*NL*
only
to
the
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
never
passed
the
line
which
divides
the
spruce
vices
from
the
*NL*
ugly
;
and
hence
,
though
his
morals
had
hardly
been
applauded
,
*NL*
disapproval
of
them
had
frequently
been
tempered
with
a
smile
.
This
*NL*
treatment
had
led
to
his
becoming
a
sort
of
regrater
of
other
men
's
*NL*
gallantries
,
to
his
own
aggrandizement
as
a
Corinthian
,
rather
than
*NL*
to
the
moral
profit
of
his
hearers
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
reason
and
his
propensities
had
seldom
any
reciprocating
*NL*
influence
,
having
separated
by
mutual
consent
long
ago
:
thence
it
*NL*
sometimes
happened
that
,
while
his
intentions
were
as
honourable
as
*NL*
could
be
wished
,
any
particular
deed
formed
a
dark
background
which
*NL*
threw
them
into
fine
relief
.
The
sergeant
's
vicious
phases
being
the
*NL*
offspring
of
impulse
,
and
his
virtuous
phases
of
cool
meditation
,
the
*NL*
latter
had
a
modest
tendency
to
be
oftener
heard
of
than
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
was
full
of
activity
,
but
his
activities
were
less
of
a
*NL*
locomotive
than
a
vegetative
nature
;
and
,
never
being
based
upon
*NL*
any
original
choice
of
foundation
or
direction
,
they
were
exercised
*NL*
on
whatever
object
chance
might
place
in
their
way
.
Hence
,
whilst
*NL*
he
sometimes
reached
the
brilliant
in
speech
because
that
was
*NL*
spontaneous
,
he
fell
below
the
commonplace
in
action
,
from
inability
*NL*
to
guide
incipient
effort
.
He
had
a
quick
comprehension
and
*NL*
considerable
force
of
character
;
but
,
being
without
the
power
to
*NL*
combine
them
,
the
comprehension
became
engaged
with
trivialities
*NL*
whilst
waiting
for
the
will
to
direct
it
,
and
the
force
wasted
itself
*NL*
in
useless
grooves
through
unheeding
the
comprehension
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
fairly
well-educated
man
for
one
of
middle
class
--
*NL*
exceptionally
well
educated
for
a
common
soldier
.
He
spoke
fluently
*NL*
and
unceasingly
.
He
could
in
this
way
be
one
thing
and
seem
another
:
*NL*
for
instance
,
he
could
speak
of
love
and
think
of
dinner
;
call
on
the
*NL*
husband
to
look
at
the
wife
;
be
eager
to
pay
and
intend
to
owe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wondrous
power
of
flattery
in
_
passados
_
at
woman
is
a
perception
*NL*
so
universal
as
to
be
remarked
upon
by
many
people
almost
as
*NL*
automatically
as
they
repeat
a
proverb
,
or
say
that
they
are
*NL*
Christians
and
the
like
,
without
thinking
much
of
the
enormous
*NL*
corollaries
which
spring
from
the
proposition
.
Still
less
is
it
*NL*
acted
upon
for
the
good
of
the
complemental
being
alluded
to
.
*NL*
With
the
majority
such
an
opinion
is
shelved
with
all
those
trite
*NL*
aphorisms
which
require
some
catastrophe
to
bring
their
tremendous
*NL*
meanings
thoroughly
home
.
When
expressed
with
some
amount
of
*NL*
reflectiveness
it
seems
co-ordinate
with
a
belief
that
this
flattery
*NL*
must
be
reasonable
to
be
effective
.
It
is
to
the
credit
of
men
that
*NL*
few
attempt
to
settle
the
question
by
experiment
,
and
it
is
for
*NL*
their
happiness
,
perhaps
,
that
accident
has
never
settled
it
for
*NL*
them
.
Nevertheless
,
that
a
male
dissembler
who
by
deluging
her
with
*NL*
untenable
fictions
charms
the
female
wisely
,
may
acquire
powers
*NL*
reaching
to
the
extremity
of
perdition
,
is
a
truth
taught
to
many
by
*NL*
unsought
and
wringing
occurrences
.
And
some
profess
to
have
attained
*NL*
to
the
same
knowledge
by
experiment
as
aforesaid
,
and
jauntily
*NL*
continue
their
indulgence
in
such
experiments
with
terrible
effect
.
*NL*
Sergeant
Troy
was
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
been
known
to
observe
casually
that
in
dealing
with
womankind
*NL*
the
only
alternative
to
flattery
was
cursing
and
swearing
.
There
was
*NL*
no
third
method
.
``
Treat
them
fairly
,
and
you
are
a
lost
man
.
''
he
*NL*
would
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
person
's
public
appearance
in
Weatherbury
promptly
followed
his
*NL*
arrival
there
.
A
week
or
two
after
the
shearing
,
Bathsheba
,
feeling
*NL*
a
nameless
relief
of
spirits
on
account
of
Boldwood
's
absence
,
*NL*
approached
her
hayfields
and
looked
over
the
hedge
towards
the
*NL*
haymakers
.
They
consisted
in
about
equal
proportions
of
gnarled
and
*NL*
flexuous
forms
,
the
former
being
the
men
,
the
latter
the
women
,
who
*NL*
wore
tilt
bonnets
covered
with
nankeen
,
which
hung
in
a
curtain
upon
*NL*
their
shoulders
.
Coggan
and
Mark
Clark
were
mowing
in
a
less
forward
*NL*
meadow
,
Clark
humming
a
tune
to
the
strokes
of
his
scythe
,
to
*NL*
which
Jan
made
no
attempt
to
keep
time
with
his
.
In
the
first
mead
*NL*
they
were
already
loading
hay
,
the
women
raking
it
into
cocks
and
*NL*
windrows
,
and
the
men
tossing
it
upon
the
waggon
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
behind
the
waggon
a
bright
scarlet
spot
emerged
,
and
went
on
*NL*
loading
unconcernedly
with
the
rest
.
It
was
the
gallant
sergeant
,
*NL*
who
had
come
haymaking
for
pleasure
;
and
nobody
could
deny
that
*NL*
he
was
doing
the
mistress
of
the
farm
real
knight-service
by
this
*NL*
voluntary
contribution
of
his
labour
at
a
busy
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
she
had
entered
the
field
Troy
saw
her
,
and
sticking
his
*NL*
pitchfork
into
the
ground
and
picking
up
his
crop
or
cane
,
he
came
*NL*
forward
.
Bathsheba
blushed
with
half-angry
embarrassment
,
and
*NL*
adjusted
her
eyes
as
well
as
her
feet
to
the
direct
line
of
her
path
.

CHAPTER

SCENE
ON
THE
VERGE
OF
THE
HAY-MEAD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Miss
Everdene
!
''
said
the
sergeant
,
touching
his
diminutive
cap
.
*NL*
``
Little
did
I
think
it
was
you
I
was
speaking
to
the
other
night
.
*NL*
And
yet
,
if
I
had
reflected
,
the
`
Queen
of
the
Corn-market
'
-LRB-
truth
is
*NL*
truth
at
any
hour
of
the
day
or
night
,
and
I
heard
you
so
named
in
*NL*
Casterbridge
yesterday
-RRB-
,
the
`
Queen
of
the
Corn-market
.
'
I
say
,
could
*NL*
be
no
other
woman
.
I
step
across
now
to
beg
your
forgiveness
a
*NL*
thousand
times
for
having
been
led
by
my
feelings
to
express
myself
*NL*
too
strongly
for
a
stranger
.
To
be
sure
I
am
no
stranger
to
the
*NL*
place
--
I
am
Sergeant
Troy
,
as
I
told
you
,
and
I
have
assisted
your
*NL*
uncle
in
these
fields
no
end
of
times
when
I
was
a
lad
.
I
have
been
*NL*
doing
the
same
for
you
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
must
thank
you
for
that
,
Sergeant
Troy
,
''
said
the
Queen
*NL*
of
the
Corn-market
,
in
an
indifferently
grateful
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
looked
hurt
and
sad
.
``
Indeed
you
must
not
,
Miss
*NL*
Everdene
,
''
he
said
.
``
Why
could
you
think
such
a
thing
necessary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
it
is
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
if
I
may
ask
without
offence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
I
do
n't
much
want
to
thank
you
for
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
have
made
a
hole
with
my
tongue
that
my
heart
will
*NL*
never
mend
.
O
these
intolerable
times
:
that
ill-luck
should
follow
*NL*
a
man
for
honestly
telling
a
woman
she
is
beautiful
!
'T
was
the
most
*NL*
I
said
--
you
must
own
that
;
and
the
least
I
could
say
--
that
I
own
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
some
talk
I
could
do
without
more
easily
than
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
.
That
remark
is
a
sort
of
digression
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
It
means
that
I
would
rather
have
your
room
than
your
company
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
would
rather
have
curses
from
you
than
kisses
from
any
other
*NL*
woman
;
so
I
'll
stay
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
absolutely
speechless
.
And
yet
she
could
not
help
*NL*
feeling
that
the
assistance
he
was
rendering
forbade
a
harsh
repulse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Troy
,
``
I
suppose
there
is
a
praise
which
is
*NL*
rudeness
,
and
that
may
be
mine
.
At
the
same
time
there
is
a
*NL*
treatment
which
is
injustice
,
and
that
may
be
yours
.
Because
a
plain
*NL*
blunt
man
,
who
has
never
been
taught
concealment
,
speaks
out
his
mind
*NL*
without
exactly
intending
it
,
he
's
to
be
snapped
off
like
the
son
of
*NL*
a
sinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
there
's
no
such
case
between
us
,
''
she
said
,
turning
away
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
allow
strangers
to
be
bold
and
impudent
--
even
in
praise
of
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
--
it
is
not
the
fact
but
the
method
which
offends
you
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
carelessly
.
``
But
I
have
the
sad
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
my
*NL*
words
,
whether
pleasing
or
offensive
,
are
unmistakably
true
.
Would
*NL*
you
have
had
me
look
at
you
,
and
tell
my
acquaintance
that
you
are
*NL*
quite
a
common-place
woman
,
to
save
you
the
embarrassment
of
being
*NL*
stared
at
if
they
come
near
you
?
Not
I.
I
could
n't
tell
any
such
*NL*
ridiculous
lie
about
a
beauty
to
encourage
a
single
woman
in
England
*NL*
in
too
excessive
a
modesty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
pretence
--
what
you
are
saying
!
''
exclaimed
Bathsheba
,
*NL*
laughing
in
spite
of
herself
at
the
sly
method
.
``
You
have
a
rare
*NL*
invention

Sergeant
Troy

Why
could
n't
you
have
passed
by
me
that

night
,
and
said
nothing

that

all

Bathsheba
moved

his

evasively

take
their

*NL*
``
Well

she
went
on
,
allowing
herself
*NL*
to
be
further
lured
into
a
conversation
that
intention
had
rigorously
*NL*
forbidden
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
know
they
think
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
certainly
have
heard
Liddy

She
*NL*
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Capitulation
--
that
was
the
purport
of
the
simple
reply
,
guarded
as
it
*NL*
was
--
capitulation
,
unknown
to
herself
.
Never
did
a
fragile
tailless
*NL*
sentence
convey
a
more
perfect
meaning
.
The
careless
sergeant
smiled
*NL*
within
himself
,
and
probably
too
the
devil
smiled
from
a
loop-hole
in
*NL*
Tophet
,
for
the
moment
was
the
turning-point
of
a
career
.
Her
tone
*NL*
and
mien
signified
beyond
mistake
that
the
seed
which
was
to
lift
the
*NL*
foundation
had
taken
root
in
the
chink
:
the
remainder
was
a
mere
*NL*
question
of
time
and
natural
changes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
the
truth
comes
out
!
''
said
the
soldier
,
in
reply
.
``
Never
tell
*NL*
me
that
a
young
lady
can
live
in
a
buzz
of
admiration
without
knowing
*NL*
something
about
it
.
Ah
,
well
,
Miss
Everdene
,
you
are
--
pardon
my
*NL*
blunt
way
--
you
are
rather
an
injury
to
our
race
than
otherwise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
--
indeed
?
''
she
said
,
opening
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
is
true
enough
.
I
may
as
well
be
hung
for
a
sheep
as
a
lamb
*NL*
-LRB-
an
old
country
saying
,
not
of
much
account
,
but
it
will
do
for
a
*NL*
rough
soldier
-RRB-
,
and
so
I
will
speak
my
mind
,
regardless
of
your
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
without
hoping
or
intending
to
get
your
pardon
.
Why
,
*NL*
Miss
Everdene
,
it
is
in
this
manner
that
your
good
looks
may
do
more
*NL*
harm
than
good
in
the
world
.
''
The
sergeant
looked
down
the
mead
in
*NL*
critical
abstraction
.
``
Probably
some
one
man
on
an
average
falls
in
*NL*
love
with
each
ordinary
woman
.
She
can
marry
him
:
he
is
content
,
*NL*
and
leads
a
useful
life
.
Such
women
as
you
a
hundred
men
always
*NL*
covet
--
your
eyes
will
bewitch
scores
on
scores
into
an
unavailing
*NL*
fancy
for
you
--
you
can
only
marry
one
of
that
many
.
Out
of
these
*NL*
say
twenty
will
endeavour
to
drown
the
bitterness
of
despised
love
*NL*
in
drink
;
twenty
more
will
mope
away
their
lives
without
a
wish
or
*NL*
attempt
to
make
a
mark
in
he
world
,
because
they
have
no
ambition
*NL*
apart
from
their
attachment
to
you
;
twenty
more
--
the
susceptible
*NL*
person
myself
possibly
among
them
--
will
be
always
draggling
after
*NL*
you
,
getting
where
they
may
just
see
you
,
doing
desperate
things
.
*NL*
Men
are
such
constant
fools
!
The
rest
may
try
to
get
over
their
*NL*
passion
with
more
or
less
success
.
But
all
these
men
will
be
*NL*
saddened
.
And
not
only
those
ninety-nine
men
,
but
the
ninety-nine
*NL*
women
they
might
have
married
are
saddened
with
them
.
There
's
my
*NL*
tale
.
That
's
why
I
say
that
a
woman
so
charming
as
yourself
,
Miss
*NL*
Everdene
,
is
hardly
a
blessing
to
her
race
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
handsome
sergeant
's
features
were
during
this
speech
as
rigid
and
*NL*
stern
as
John
Knox
's
in
addressing
his
gay
young
queen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
she
made
no
reply
,
he
said
,
``
Do
you
read
French
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
began
,
but
when
I
got
to
the
verbs
,
father
died
,
''
she
said
*NL*
simply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

when
I
have
an
opportunity

latterly
has
not
been
often

my
mother
was
a
Parisienne
-RRB-
--
and
there
's
a
proverb
they
have
,
*NL*
_
Qui

He
chastens
who

Do
you
*NL*
understand
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
she
replied
,
and
there
was
even
a
little
tremulousness
in
the
*NL*
usually
cool
girl
's
voice
;
``
if
you
can
only
fight
half
as
winningly
*NL*
as
you
can
talk

you
are
able
to
make
a
pleasure
of
a
bayonet
wound
!
''
*NL*
And
then
poor
Bathsheba
instantly
perceived
her
slip
in
making
this
*NL*
admission
:
in
hastily
trying
to
retrieve
it
,
she
went
from
bad
to
*NL*
worse
.
``
Do

any
pleasure

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

said
Troy
,
with
much
hearty
*NL*
conviction
on
the
exterior
of
his
face
:
and
altering
the
expression
*NL*
to
moodiness
;
``
when
a
dozen
men
are
ready

speak
tenderly
to
you
,
*NL*
and
give
the
admiration
you
deserve

adding
the
warning
you
*NL*
need
,
it
stands
to
reason
that
my
poor
rough-and-ready
mixture
of
*NL*
praise
and
blame
can
not
convey
much
pleasure
.
Fool
as
I
may
be

I
*NL*
am
not
so
conceited

to
suppose
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you

conceited

said
Bathsheba
,
looking
*NL*
askance
at
a
reed
she
was
fitfully
pulling
with
one
hand
,
having
*NL*
lately
grown
feverish
under
the
soldier
's
system
of
procedure
--
not
*NL*
because
the
nature
of
his
cajolery
was
entirely
unperceived
,
but
*NL*
because
its
vigour
was
overwhelming
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
own
it
to
anybody
else

do
I
exactly

Still
,
*NL*
there
might
have
been
some
self-conceit
in
my
foolish
supposition
*NL*
the
other
night
.
I
knew
that
what
I
said
in
admiration
might
be
*NL*
an
opinion
too
often
forced
upon
you
to
give
any
pleasure

I
*NL*
certainly
did
think
that
the
kindness
of
your
nature
might
prevent
*NL*
you
judging
an
uncontrolled
tongue
harshly

you
have
done

*NL*
thinking
badly
of
me

wounding
me

``

said
the
shrewd

in
painfully
innocent
earnest

knew
what
the
young
man
was
intending
,
a
heavy
gold
*NL*
watch
was
in
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
an
unusually
good
one
for
a
man
like
me
to
possess
,
''
he
*NL*
quietly
said
.
``
That
watch
has
a
history
.
Press
the
spring
and
open
*NL*
the
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
so
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
see
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
crest
and
a
motto
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
coronet
with
five
points
,
and
beneath
,
_
Cedit
amor
rebus
_
--
`
Love
*NL*
yields
to
circumstance
.
'
It
's
the
motto
of
the
Earls
of
Severn
.
*NL*
That
watch
belonged
to
the
last
lord
,
and
was
given
to
my
mother
's
*NL*
husband
,
a
medical
man
,
for
his
use
till
I
came
of
age
,
when
it
was
*NL*
to
be
given
to
me
.
It
was
all
the
fortune
that
ever
I
inherited
.
*NL*
That
watch
has
regulated
imperial
interests
in
its
time
--
the
stately
*NL*
ceremonial
,
the
courtly
assignation
,
pompous
travels
,
and
lordly
*NL*
sleeps
.
Now
it
is
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Sergeant
Troy
,
I
can
not
take
this
--
I
can
not
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
*NL*
with
round-eyed
wonder
.
``
A
gold
watch
!
What
are
you
doing
?
Do
n't
*NL*
be
such
a
dissembler
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
retreated
to
avoid
receiving
back
his
gift
,
which
she
*NL*
held
out
persistently
towards
him
.
Bathsheba
followed
as
he
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
it
--
do
,
Miss
Everdene
--
keep
it
!
''
said
the
erratic
child
of
*NL*
impulse
.
``
The
fact
of
your
possessing
it
makes
it
worth
ten
times
*NL*
as
much
to
me
.
A
more
plebeian
one
will
answer
my
purpose
just
*NL*
as
well
,
and
the
pleasure
of
knowing
whose
heart
my
old
one
beats
*NL*
against

well
,
I
wo
n't
speak
of
that

It
is
in

worthier
hands

than
ever
it
has
been
in
before

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
indeed
I
ca
n't
have
it

''
she
said
,
in
a
perfect
simmer
of
*NL*
distress
.
``
Oh
,
how
can
you
do
such
a
thing
;
that
is
if
you
really
*NL*
mean
it

Give
me
your
dead
father
's
watch

such
a
valuable
one

*NL*
You
should
not
be
so
reckless
,
indeed
,
Sergeant
Troy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
loved
my
father
:
good
;
but
better
,
I
love
you
more
.
That
's
how
I
*NL*
can
do
it
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
with
an
intonation
of
such
exquisite
*NL*
fidelity
to
nature
that
it
was
evidently
not
all
acted
now
.
Her
*NL*
beauty
,
which
,
whilst
it
had
been
quiescent
,
he
had
praised
in
jest
,
*NL*
had
in
its
animated
phases
moved
him
to
earnest
;
and
though
his
*NL*
seriousness
was
less
than
she
imagined
,
it
was
probably
more
than
he
*NL*
imagined
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
brimming
with
agitated
bewilderment
,
and
she
said
,
in
*NL*
half-suspicious
accents
of
feeling
,
``
Can
it
be
!
Oh
,
how
can
it
be
,
*NL*
that
you
care
for
me
,
and
so
suddenly
!
You
have
seen
so
little
*NL*
of
me
:
I
may
not
be
really
so
--
so
nice-looking
as
I
seem
to
you
.
*NL*
Please
,
do
take
it
;
Oh
,
do
!
I
can
not
and
will
not
have
it
.
Believe
*NL*
me
,
your
generosity
is
too
great
.
I
have
never
done
you
a
single
*NL*
kindness
,
and
why
should
you
be
so
kind
to
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
factitious
reply
had
been
again
upon
his
lips
,
but
it
was
again
*NL*
suspended
,
and
he
looked
at
her
with
an
arrested
eye
.
The
truth
was
,
*NL*
that
as
she
now
stood
--
excited
,
wild
,
and
honest
as
the
day
--
her
*NL*
alluring
beauty
bore
out
so
fully
the
epithets
he
had
bestowed
upon
*NL*
it
that
he
was
quite
startled
at
his
temerity
in
advancing
them
as
*NL*
false
.
He
said
mechanically
,
``
Ah
,
why
?
''
and
continued
to
look
at
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
my
workfolk
see
me
following
you
about
the
field
,
and
are
*NL*
wondering
.
Oh
,
this
is
dreadful
!
''
she
went
on
,
unconscious
of
the
*NL*
transmutation
she
was
effecting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
quite
mean
you
to
accept
it
at
first
,
for
it
was
my
one
*NL*
poor
patent
of
nobility
,
''
he
broke
out
,
bluntly
;
``
but
,
upon
my
soul
,
*NL*
I
wish
you
would
now
.
Without
any
shamming
,
come
!
Do
n't
deny
me
the
*NL*
happiness
of
wearing
it
for
my
sake
?
But
you
are
too
lovely
even
to
*NL*
care
to
be
kind
as
others
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
do
n't
say
so
!
I
have
reasons
for
reserve
which
I
can
not
*NL*
explain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
it
be
,
then
,
let
it
be
,
''
he
said
,
receiving
back
the
watch
at
*NL*
last
;
``
I
must
be
leaving
you
now
.
And
will
you
speak
to
me
for
these
*NL*
few
weeks
of
my
stay
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
will
.
Yet
,
I
do
n't
know
if
I
will
!
Oh
,
why
did
you
come
*NL*
and
disturb
me
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
in
setting
a
gin
,
I
have
caught
myself
.
Such
things
have
*NL*
happened
.
Well
,
will
you
let
me
work
in
your
fields
?
''
he
coaxed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
suppose
so
;
if
it
is
any
pleasure
to
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Everdene
,
I
thank
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sergeant
brought
his
hand
to
the
cap
on
the
slope
of
his
head
,
*NL*
saluted
,
and
returned
to
the
distant
group
of
haymakers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
could
not
face
the
haymakers
now
.
Her
heart
erratically
*NL*
flitting
hither
and
thither
from
perplexed
excitement
,
hot
,
and
*NL*
almost
tearful
,
she
retreated
homeward
,
murmuring
,
``
Oh
,
what
have
I
*NL*
done
!
What
does
it
mean
!
I
wish
I
knew
how
much
of
it
was
true

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HIVING
THE
BEES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Weatherbury
bees
were
late
in
their
swarming
this
year
.
It
was
in
*NL*
the
latter
part
of
June
,
and
the
day
after
the
interview
with
Troy
in
*NL*
the
hayfield
,
that
Bathsheba
was
standing
in
her
garden
,
watching
a
*NL*
swarm
in
the
air
and
guessing
their
probable
settling
place
.
Not
*NL*
only
were
they
late
this
year
,
but
unruly
.
Sometimes
throughout
a
*NL*
whole
season
all
the
swarms
would
alight
on
the
lowest
attainable
*NL*
bough
--
such
as
part
of
a
currant-bush
or
espalier
apple-tree
;
next
*NL*
year
they
would
,
with
just
the
same
unanimity
,
make
straight
off
to
*NL*
the
uppermost
member
of
some
tall
,
gaunt
costard
,
or
quarrenden
,
*NL*
and
there
defy
all
invaders
who
did
not
come
armed
with
ladders
and
*NL*
staves
to
take
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
case
at
present
.
Bathsheba
's
eyes
,
shaded
by
one
hand
,
*NL*
were
following
the
ascending
multitude
against
the
unexplorable
*NL*
stretch
of
blue
till
they
ultimately
halted
by
one
of
the
unwieldy
*NL*
trees
spoken
of
.
A
process
somewhat
analogous
to
that
of
alleged
*NL*
formations
of
the
universe
,
time
and
times
ago
,
was
observable
.
The
*NL*
bustling
swarm
had
swept
the
sky
in
a
scattered
and
uniform
haze
,
*NL*
which
now
thickened
to
a
nebulous
centre
:
this
glided
on
to
a
bough
*NL*
and
grew
still
denser
,
till
it
formed
a
solid
black
spot
upon
the
*NL*
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
and
women
being
all
busily
engaged
in
saving
the
hay
--
even
*NL*
Liddy
had
left
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
lending
a
hand
--
Bathsheba
*NL*
resolved
to
hive
the
bees
herself
,
if
possible
.
She
had
dressed
the
*NL*
hive
with
herbs
and
honey
,
fetched
a
ladder
,
brush
,
and
crook
,
made
*NL*
herself
impregnable
with
armour
of
leather
gloves
,
straw
hat
,
and
*NL*
large
gauze
veil
--
once
green
but
now
faded
to
snuff
colour
--
and
*NL*
ascended
a
dozen
rungs
of
the
ladder
.
At
once
she
heard
,
not
ten
*NL*
yards
off
,
a
voice
that
was
beginning
to
have
a
strange
power
in
*NL*
agitating
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Everdene
,
let
me
assist
you
;
you
should
not
attempt
such
a
*NL*
thing
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
was
just
opening
the
garden
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
flung
down
the
brush
,
crook
,
and
empty
hive
,
pulled
the
*NL*
skirt
of
her
dress
tightly
round
her
ankles
in
a
tremendous
flurry
,
*NL*
and
as
well
as
she
could
slid
down
the
ladder
.
By
the
time
she
*NL*
reached
the
bottom
Troy
was
there
also
,
and
he
stooped
to
pick
up
*NL*
the
hive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
fortunate
I
am
to
have
dropped
in
at
this
moment
!
''
exclaimed
the
*NL*
sergeant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
her
voice
in
a
minute
.
``
What
!
and
will
you
shake
them
in
*NL*
for
me
?
''
she
asked
,
in
what
,
for
a
defiant
girl
,
was
a
faltering
way
;
*NL*
though
,
for
a
timid
girl
,
it
would
have
seemed
a
brave
way
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
I
!
''
said
Troy
.
``
Why
,
of
course
I
will
.
How
blooming
you
are
*NL*
to-day
!
''
Troy
flung
down
his
cane
and
put
his
foot
on
the
ladder
to
*NL*
ascend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
must
have
on
the
veil
and
gloves
,
or
you
'll
be
stung
*NL*
fearfully
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
.
I
must
put
on
the
veil
and
gloves
.
Will
you
kindly
show
*NL*
me
how
to
fix
them
properly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
must
have
the
broad-brimmed
hat
,
too
,
for
your
cap
has
no
*NL*
brim
to
keep
the
veil
off
,
and
they
'd
reach
your
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
broad-brimmed
hat
,
too
,
by
all
means
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
a
whimsical
fate
ordered
that
her
hat
should
be
taken
off
--
veil
*NL*
and
all
attached
--
and
placed
upon
his
head
,
Troy
tossing
his
own
into
*NL*
a
gooseberry
bush
.
Then
the
veil
had
to
be
tied
at
its
lower
edge
*NL*
round
his
collar
and
the
gloves
put
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
such
an
extraordinary
object
in
this
guise
that
,
flurried
*NL*
as
she
was
,
she
could
not
avoid
laughing
outright
.
It
was
the
removal
*NL*
of
yet
another
stake
from
the
palisade
of
cold
manners
which
had
kept
*NL*
him
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
looked
on
from
the
ground
whilst
he
was
busy
sweeping
and
*NL*
shaking
the
bees
from
the
tree
,
holding
up
the
hive
with
the
other
*NL*
hand
for
them
to
fall
into
.
She
made
use
of
an
unobserved
minute
*NL*
whilst
his
attention
was
absorbed
in
the
operation
to
arrange
her
*NL*
plumes
a
little
.
He
came
down
holding
the
hive
at
arm
's
length
,
*NL*
behind
which
trailed
a
cloud
of
bees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
life
,
''
said
Troy
,
through
the
veil
,
``
holding
up
this
hive
*NL*
makes
one
's
arm
ache
worse
than
a
week
of
sword-exercise
.
''
When
the
*NL*
manoeuvre
was
complete
he
approached
her
.
``
Would
you
be
good
enough
*NL*
to
untie
me
and
let
me
out
?
I
am
nearly
stifled
inside
this
silk
*NL*
cage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
hide
her
embarrassment
during
the
unwonted
process
of
untying
the
*NL*
string
about
his
neck
,
she
said
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
never
seen
that
you
spoke
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
sword-exercise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
would
you
like
to
?
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
hesitated
.
She
had
heard
wondrous
reports
from
time
to
*NL*
time
by
dwellers
in
Weatherbury
,
who
had
by
chance
sojourned
awhile
*NL*
in
Casterbridge
,
near
the
barracks
,
of
this
strange
and
glorious
*NL*
performance
,
the
sword-exercise
.
Men
and
boys
who
had
peeped
through
*NL*
chinks
or
over
walls
into
the
barrack-yard
returned
with
accounts
of
*NL*
its
being
the
most
flashing
affair
conceivable
;
accoutrements
and
*NL*
weapons
glistening
like
stars
--
here
,
there
,
around
--
yet
all
by
rule
*NL*
and
compass
.
So
she
said
mildly
what
she
felt
strongly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
should
like
to
see
it
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
you
shall
;
you
shall
see
me
go
through
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
consider
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
with
a
walking-stick
--
I
do
n't
care
to
see
that
.
It
must
be
a
*NL*
real
sword
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
;
and
I
have
no
sword
here
;
but
I
think
I
could
get
one
*NL*
by
the
evening
.
Now
,
will
you
do
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
bent
over
her
and
murmured
some
suggestion
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
indeed
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
blushing
.
``
Thank
you
very
much
,
but
*NL*
I
could
n't
on
any
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Surely
you
might
?
Nobody
would
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
,
but
with
a
weakened
negation
.
``
If
I
were
to
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
``
I
must
bring
Liddy
too
.
Might
I
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
looked
far
away
.
``
I
do
n't
see
why
you
want
to
bring
her
,
''
he
*NL*
said
coldly
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
unconscious
look
of
assent
in
Bathsheba
's
eyes
betrayed
that
*NL*
something
more
than
his
coldness
had
made
her
also
feel
that
Liddy
*NL*
would
be
superfluous
in
the
suggested
scene
.
She
had
felt
it
,
even
*NL*
whilst
making
the
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wo
n't
bring
Liddy
--
and
I
'll
come
.
But
only
for
a
very
short
*NL*
time
,
''
she
added
;
``
a
very
short
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
not
take
five
minutes
,
''
said
Troy

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
HOLLOW
AMID
THE
FERNS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
hill
opposite
Bathsheba
's
dwelling
extended
,
a
mile
off
,
into
an
*NL*
uncultivated
tract
of
land
,
dotted
at
this
season
with
tall
thickets
*NL*
of
brake
fern
,
plump
and
diaphanous
from
recent
rapid
growth
,
and
*NL*
radiant
in
hues
of
clear
and
untainted
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
eight
o'clock
this
midsummer
evening
,
whilst
the
bristling
ball
*NL*
of
gold
in
the
west
still
swept
the
tips
of
the
ferns
with
its
long
,
*NL*
luxuriant
rays
,
a
soft
brushing-by
of
garments
might
have
been
heard
*NL*
among
them
,
and
Bathsheba
appeared
in
their
midst
,
their
soft
,
*NL*
feathery
arms
caressing
her
up
to
her
shoulders
.
She
paused
,
turned
,
*NL*
went
back
over
the
hill
and
half-way
to
her
own
door
,
whence
she
cast
*NL*
a
farewell
glance
upon
the
spot
she
had
just
left
,
having
resolved
*NL*
not
to
remain
near
the
place
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
a
dim
spot
of
artificial
red
moving
round
the
shoulder
of
the
*NL*
rise
.
It
disappeared
on
the
other
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
one
minute
--
two
minutes
--
thought
of
Troy
's
disappointment
*NL*
at
her
non-fulfilment
of
a
promised
engagement
,
till
she
again
ran
*NL*
along
the
field
,
clambered
over
the
bank
,
and
followed
the
original
*NL*
direction
.
She
was
now
literally
trembling
and
panting
at
this
her
*NL*
temerity
in
such
an
errant
undertaking
;
her
breath
came
and
went
*NL*
quickly
,
and
her
eyes
shone
with
an
infrequent
light
.
Yet
go
she
*NL*
must
.
She
reached
the
verge
of
a
pit
in
the
middle
of
the
ferns
.
*NL*
Troy
stood
in
the
bottom
,
looking
up
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
you
rustling
through
the
fern
before
I
saw
you
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
coming
up
and
giving
her
his
hand
to
help
her
down
the
slope
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pit
was
a
saucer-shaped
concave
,
naturally
formed
,
with
a
top
*NL*
diameter
of
about
thirty
feet
,
and
shallow
enough
to
allow
the
*NL*
sunshine
to
reach
their
heads
.
Standing
in
the
centre
,
the
sky
*NL*
overhead
was
met
by
a
circular
horizon
of
fern
:
this
grew
nearly
to
*NL*
the
bottom
of
the
slope
and
then
abruptly
ceased
.
The
middle
within
*NL*
the
belt
of
verdure
was
floored
with
a
thick
flossy
carpet
of
moss
*NL*
and
grass
intermingled
,
so
yielding
that
the
foot
was
half-buried
*NL*
within
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Troy
,
producing
the
sword
,
which
,
as
he
raised
it
into
*NL*
the
sunlight
,
gleamed
a
sort
of
greeting
,
like
a
living
thing
,
*NL*
``
first
,
we
have
four
right
and
four
left
cuts
;
four
right
and
four
*NL*
left
thrusts
.
Infantry
cuts
and
guards
are
more
interesting
than
*NL*
ours
,
to
my
mind
;
but
they
are
not
so
swashing
.
They
have
seven
*NL*
cuts
and
three
thrusts
.
So
much
as
a
preliminary
.
Well
,
next
,
our
*NL*
cut
one
is
as
if
you
were
sowing
your
corn
--
so
.
''
Bathsheba
saw
a
*NL*
sort
of
rainbow
,
upside
down
in
the
air
,
and
Troy
's
arm
was
still
*NL*
again
.
``
Cut
two
,
as
if
you
were
hedging
--
so
.
Three
,
as
if
you
were
*NL*
reaping
--
so
.
Four
,
as
if
you
were
threshing
--
in
that
way
.
Then
the
*NL*
same
on
the
left
.
The
thrusts
are
these
:
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
*NL*
right
;
one
,
two
,
three
,
four
,
left
.
''
He
repeated
them
.
``
Have
'em
*NL*
again
?
''
he
said
.
``
One
,
two
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurriedly
interrupted
:
``
I
'd
rather
not
;
though
I
do
n't
mind
your
*NL*
twos
and
fours
;
but
your
ones
and
threes
are
terrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
I
'll
let
you
off
the
ones
and
threes
.
Next
,
cuts
,
*NL*
points
and
guards
altogether
.
''
Troy
duly
exhibited
them
.
``
Then
*NL*
there
's
pursuing
practice
,
in
this
way
.
''
He
gave
the
movements
as
*NL*
before
.
``
There
,
those
are
the
stereotyped
forms
.
The
infantry
have
*NL*
two
most
diabolical
upward
cuts
,
which
we
are
too
humane
to
use
.
*NL*
Like
this
--
three
,
four
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
murderous
and
bloodthirsty
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
rather
deathly
.
Now
I
'll
be
more
interesting
,
and
let
you
*NL*
see
some
loose
play
--
giving
all
the
cuts
and
points
,
infantry
and
*NL*
cavalry
,
quicker
than
lightning
,
and
as
promiscuously
--
with
just
*NL*
enough
rule
to
regulate
instinct
and
yet
not
to
fetter
it
.
You
are
*NL*
my
antagonist
,
with
this
difference
from
real
warfare
,
that
I
shall
*NL*
miss
you
every
time
by
one
hair
's
breadth
,
or
perhaps
two
.
Mind
you
*NL*
do
n't
flinch
,
whatever
you
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
sure
not
to
!
''
she
said
invincibly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
pointed
to
about
a
yard
in
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
adventurous
spirit
was
beginning
to
find
some
grains
of
*NL*
relish
in
these
highly
novel
proceedings
.
She
took
up
her
position
*NL*
as
directed
,
facing
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
just
to
learn
whether
you
have
pluck
enough
to
let
me
do
what
I
*NL*
wish
,
I
'll
give
you
a
preliminary
test
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
flourished
the
sword
by
way
of
introduction
number
two
,
and
the
*NL*
next
thing
of
which
she
was
conscious
was
that
the
point
and
blade
of
*NL*
the
sword
were
darting
with
a
gleam
towards
her
left
side
,
just
above
*NL*
her
hip
;
then
of
their
reappearance
on
her
right
side
,
emerging
as
*NL*
it
were
from
between
her
ribs
,
having
apparently
passed
through
her
*NL*
body
.
The
third
item
of
consciousness
was
that
of
seeing
the
same
*NL*
sword
,
perfectly
clean
and
free
from
blood
held
vertically
in
Troy
's
*NL*
hand
-LRB-
in
the
position
technically
called
``
recover
swords
''
-RRB-
.
All
was
*NL*
as
quick
as
electricity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
she
cried
out
in
affright
,
pressing
her
hand
to
her
side
.
``
Have
*NL*
you
run
me
through
?
--
no
,
you
have
not
!
Whatever
have
you
done
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
not
touched
you
,
''
said
Troy
,
quietly
.
``
It
was
mere
sleight
*NL*
of
hand
.
The
sword
passed
behind
you
.
Now
you
are
not
afraid
,
are
*NL*
you
?
Because
if
you
are
I
ca
n't
perform
.
I
give
my
word
that
I
will
*NL*
not
only
not
hurt
you
,
but
not
once
touch
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
I
am
afraid
.
You
are
quite
sure
you
will
not
hurt
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
the
sword
very
sharp
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
--
only
stand
as
still
as
a
statue
.
Now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
an
instant
the
atmosphere
was
transformed
to
Bathsheba
's
eyes
.
*NL*
Beams
of
light
caught
from
the
low
sun
's
rays
,
above
,
around
,
in
*NL*
front
of
her
,
well-nigh
shut
out
earth
and
heaven
--
all
emitted
in
*NL*
the
marvellous
evolutions
of
Troy
's
reflecting
blade
,
which
seemed
*NL*
everywhere
at
once
,
and
yet
nowhere
specially
.
These
circling
gleams
*NL*
were
accompanied
by
a
keen
rush
that
was
almost
a
whistling
--
also
*NL*
springing
from
all
sides
of
her
at
once
.
In
short
,
she
was
enclosed
*NL*
in
a
firmament
of
light
,
and
of
sharp
hisses
,
resembling
a
sky-full
*NL*
of
meteors
close
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
since
the
broadsword
became
the
national
weapon
had
there
been
*NL*
more
dexterity
shown
in
its
management
than
by
the
hands
of
Sergeant
*NL*
Troy
,
and
never
had
he
been
in
such
splendid
temper
for
the
*NL*
performance
as
now
in
the
evening
sunshine
among
the
ferns
with
*NL*
Bathsheba
.
It
may
safely
be
asserted
with
respect
to
the
closeness
*NL*
of
his
cuts
,
that
had
it
been
possible
for
the
edge
of
the
sword
to
*NL*
leave
in
the
air
a
permanent
substance
wherever
it
flew
past
,
the
*NL*
space
left
untouched
would
have
been
almost
a
mould
of
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
the
luminous
streams
of
this
_
aurora
militaris
_
,
she
could
see
*NL*
the
hue
of
Troy
's
sword
arm
,
spread
in
a
scarlet
haze
over
the
space
*NL*
covered
by
its
motions
,
like
a
twanged
harpstring
,
and
behind
all
*NL*
Troy
himself
,
mostly
facing
her
;
sometimes
,
to
show
the
rear
cuts
,
*NL*
half
turned
away
,
his
eye
nevertheless
always
keenly
measuring
*NL*
her
breadth
and
outline
,
and
his
lips
tightly
closed
in
sustained
*NL*
effort
.
Next
,
his
movements
lapsed
slower
,
and
she
could
see
them
*NL*
individually
.
The
hissing
of
the
sword
had
ceased
,
and
he
stopped
*NL*
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
outer
loose
lock
of
hair
wants
tidying
,
''
he
said
,
before
she
*NL*
had
moved
or
spoken
.
``
Wait
:
I
'll
do
it
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
arc
of
silver
shone
on
her
right
side
:
the
sword
had
descended
.
*NL*
The
lock
dropped
to
the
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bravely
borne
!
''
said
Troy
.
``
You
did
n't
flinch
a
shade
's
thickness
.
*NL*
Wonderful
in
a
woman
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
because
I
did
n't
expect
it
.
Oh
,
you
have
spoilt
my
hair
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
once
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no
!
I
am
afraid
of
you
--
indeed
I
am
!
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo
n't
touch
you
at
all
--
not
even
your
hair
.
I
am
only
going
to
*NL*
kill
that
caterpillar
settling
on
you
.
Now
:
still
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
a
caterpillar
had
come
from
the
fern
and
chosen
the
*NL*
front
of
her
bodice
as
his
resting
place
.
She
saw
the
point
glisten
*NL*
towards
her
bosom
,
and
seemingly
enter
it
.
Bathsheba
closed
her
eyes
*NL*
in
the
full
persuasion
that
she
was
killed
at
last
.
However
,
feeling
*NL*
just
as
usual
,
she
opened
them
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
it
is
,
look
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
holding
his
sword
before
her
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
caterpillar
was
spitted
upon
its
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
it
is
magic
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
dexterity
.
I
merely
gave
point
to
your
bosom
where
the
*NL*
caterpillar
was
,
and
instead
of
running
you
through
checked
the
*NL*
extension
a
thousandth
of
an
inch
short
of
your
surface
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
could
you
chop
off
a
curl
of
my
hair
with
a
sword
that
has
*NL*
no
edge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
edge
!
This
sword
will
shave
like
a
razor
.
Look
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
touched
the
palm
of
his
hand
with
the
blade
,
and
then
,
lifting
it
,
*NL*
showed
her
a
thin
shaving
of
scarf-skin
dangling
therefrom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
said
before
beginning
that
it
was
blunt
and
could
n't
cut
*NL*
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
to
get
you
to
stand
still
,
and
so
make
sure
of
your
safety
.
*NL*
The
risk
of
injuring
you
through
your
moving
was
too
great
not
to
*NL*
force
me
to
tell
you
a
fib
to
escape
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shuddered
.
``
I
have
been
within
an
inch
of
my
life
,
and
did
n't
*NL*
know
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
precisely
speaking
,
you
have
been
within
half
an
inch
of
being
*NL*
pared
alive
two
hundred
and
ninety-five
times
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
,
cruel
,
't
is
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
perfectly
safe
,
nevertheless
.
My
sword
never
errs
.
''
*NL*
And
Troy
returned
the
weapon
to
the
scabbard
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
overcome
by
a
hundred
tumultuous
feelings
resulting
from
*NL*
the
scene
,
abstractedly
sat
down
on
a
tuft
of
heather
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
leave
you
now
,
''
said
Troy
,
softly
.
``
And
I
'll
venture
to
take
*NL*
and
keep
this
in
remembrance
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
him
stoop
to
the
grass
,
pick
up
the
winding
lock
which
he
*NL*
had
severed
from
her
manifold
tresses
,
twist
it
round
his
fingers
,
*NL*
unfasten
a
button
in
the
breast
of
his
coat
,
and
carefully
put
*NL*
it
inside
.
She
felt
powerless
to
withstand
or
deny
him
.
He
was
*NL*
altogether
too
much
for
her
,
and
Bathsheba
seemed
as
one
who
,
facing
*NL*
a
reviving
wind
,
finds
it
blow
so
strongly
that
it
stops
the
breath
.
*NL*
He
drew
near
and
said
,
``
I
must
be
leaving
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
nearer
still
.
A
minute
later
and
she
saw
his
scarlet
form
*NL*
disappear
amid
the
ferny
thicket
,
almost
in
a
flash
,
like
a
brand
*NL*
swiftly
waved
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
minute
's
interval
had
brought
the
blood
beating
into
her
face
,
*NL*
set
her
stinging
as
if
aflame
to
the
very
hollows
of
her
feet
,
and
*NL*
enlarged
emotion
to
a
compass
which
quite
swamped
thought
.
It
had
*NL*
brought
upon
her
a
stroke
resulting
,
as
did
that
of
Moses
in
Horeb
,
*NL*
in
a
liquid
stream
--
here
a
stream
of
tears
.
She
felt
like
one
who
*NL*
has
sinned
a
great
sin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circumstance
had
been
the
gentle
dip
of
Troy
's
mouth
downwards
*NL*
upon
her
own
.
He
had
kissed
her

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
PARTICULARS
OF
A
TWILIGHT
WALK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
now
see
the
element
of
folly
distinctly
mingling
with
the
many
*NL*
varying
particulars
which
made
up
the
character
of
Bathsheba
*NL*
Everdene
.
It
was
almost
foreign
to
her
intrinsic
nature
.
Introduced
*NL*
as
lymph
on
the
dart
of
Eros
,
it
eventually
permeated
and
coloured
*NL*
her
whole
constitution
.
Bathsheba
,
though
she
had
too
much
*NL*
understanding
to
be
entirely
governed
by
her
womanliness
,
had
too
*NL*
much
womanliness
to
use
her
understanding
to
the
best
advantage
.
*NL*
Perhaps
in
no
minor
point
does
woman
astonish
her
helpmate
more
than
*NL*
in
the
strange
power
she
possesses
of
believing
cajoleries
that
she
*NL*
knows
to
be
false
--
except
,
indeed
,
in
that
of
being
utterly
sceptical
*NL*
on
strictures
that
she
knows
to
be
true
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
loved
Troy
in
the
way
that
only
self-reliant
women
*NL*
love
when
they
abandon
their
self-reliance
.
When
a
strong
woman
*NL*
recklessly
throws
away
her
strength
she
is
worse
than
a
weak
woman
*NL*
who
has
never
had
any
strength
to
throw
away
.
One
source
of
her
*NL*
inadequacy
is
the
novelty
of
the
occasion
.
She
has
never
had
practice
*NL*
in
making
the
best
of
such
a
condition
.
Weakness
is
doubly
weak
by
*NL*
being
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
not
conscious
of
guile
in
this
matter
.
Though
in
one
*NL*
sense
a
woman
of
the
world
,
it
was
,
after
all
,
that
world
of
daylight
*NL*
coteries
and
green
carpets
wherein
cattle
form
the
passing
crowd
and
*NL*
winds
the
busy
hum
;
where
a
quiet
family
of
rabbits
or
hares
lives
on
*NL*
the
other
side
of
your
party-wall
,
where
your
neighbour
is
everybody
*NL*
in
the
tything
,
and
where
calculation
is
confined
to
market-days
.
*NL*
Of
the
fabricated
tastes
of
good
fashionable
society
she
knew
but
*NL*
little
,
and
of
the
formulated
self-indulgence
of
bad
,
nothing
at
all
.
*NL*
Had
her
utmost
thoughts
in
this
direction
been
distinctly
worded
-LRB-
and
*NL*
by
herself
they
never
were
-RRB-
,
they
would
only
have
amounted
to
such
a
*NL*
matter
as
that
she
felt
her
impulses
to
be
pleasanter
guides
than
her
*NL*
discretion
.
Her
love
was
entire
as
a
child
's
,
and
though
warm
as
*NL*
summer
it
was
fresh
as
spring
.
Her
culpability
lay
in
her
making
*NL*
no
attempt
to
control
feeling
by
subtle
and
careful
inquiry
into
*NL*
consequences
.
She
could
show
others
the
steep
and
thorny
way
,
but
*NL*
``
reck
'd
not
her
own
rede
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
Troy
's
deformities
lay
deep
down
from
a
woman
's
vision
,
whilst
*NL*
his
embellishments
were
upon
the
very
surface
;
thus
contrasting
with
*NL*
homely
Oak
,
whose
defects
were
patent
to
the
blindest
,
and
whose
*NL*
virtues
were
as
metals
in
a
mine
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
difference
between
love
and
respect
was
markedly
shown
in
her
*NL*
conduct
.
Bathsheba
had
spoken
of
her
interest
in
Boldwood
with
the
*NL*
greatest
freedom
to
Liddy
,
but
she
had
only
communed
with
her
own
*NL*
heart
concerning
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
infatuation
Gabriel
saw
,
and
was
troubled
thereby
from
the
*NL*
time
of
his
daily
journey
a-field
to
the
time
of
his
return
,
and
on
*NL*
to
the
small
hours
of
many
a
night
.
That
he
was
not
beloved
had
*NL*
hitherto
been
his
great
sorrow
;
that
Bathsheba
was
getting
into
*NL*
the
toils
was
now
a
sorrow
greater
than
the
first
,
and
one
which
*NL*
nearly
obscured
it
.
It
was
a
result
which
paralleled
the
oft-quoted
*NL*
observation
of
Hippocrates
concerning
physical
pains
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
is
a
noble
though
perhaps
an
unpromising
love
which
not
even
the
*NL*
fear
of
breeding
aversion
in
the
bosom
of
the
one
beloved
can
deter
*NL*
from
combating
his
or
her
errors
.
Oak
determined
to
speak
to
his
*NL*
mistress
.
He
would
base
his
appeal
on
what
he
considered
her
unfair
*NL*
treatment
of
Farmer
Boldwood
,
now
absent
from
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
opportunity
occurred
one
evening
when
she
had
gone
for
a
short
*NL*
walk
by
a
path
through
the
neighbouring
cornfields
.
It
was
dusk
when
*NL*
Oak
,
who
had
not
been
far
a-field
that
day
,
took
the
same
path
and
*NL*
met
her
returning
,
quite
pensively
,
as
he
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wheat
was
now
tall
,
and
the
path
was
narrow
;
thus
the
way
was
*NL*
quite
a
sunken
groove
between
the
embowing
thicket
on
either
side
.
*NL*
Two
persons
could
not
walk
abreast
without
damaging
the
crop
,
and
*NL*
Oak
stood
aside
to
let
her
pass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
is
it
Gabriel
?
''
she
said
.
``
You
are
taking
a
walk
too
.
*NL*
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
I
would
come
to
meet
you
,
as
it
is
rather
late
,
''
said
Oak
,
*NL*
turning
and
following
at
her
heels
when
she
had
brushed
somewhat
*NL*
quickly
by
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
indeed
,
but
I
am
not
very
fearful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
but
there
are
bad
characters
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
meet
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Oak
,
with
marvellous
ingenuity
,
had
been
going
to
introduce
the
*NL*
gallant
sergeant
through
the
channel
of
``
bad
characters
.
''
But
all
at
*NL*
once
the
scheme
broke
down
,
it
suddenly
occurring
to
him
that
this
*NL*
was
rather
a
clumsy
way
,
and
too
barefaced
to
begin
with
.
He
tried
*NL*
another
preamble
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
the
man
who
would
naturally
come
to
meet
you
is
away
from
*NL*
home
,
too
--
I
mean
Farmer
Boldwood
--
why
,
thinks
I
,
I
'll
go
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
yes
.
''
She
walked
on
without
turning
her
head
,
and
for
many
*NL*
steps
nothing
further
was
heard
from
her
quarter
than
the
rustle
*NL*
of
her
dress
against
the
heavy
corn-ears
.
Then
she
resumed
rather
*NL*
tartly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
quite
understand
what
you
meant
by
saying
that
Mr.
Boldwood
*NL*
would
naturally
come
to
meet
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
I
meant
on
account
of
the
wedding
which
they
say
is
likely
to
take
*NL*
place
between
you
and
him
,
miss
.
Forgive
my
speaking
plainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
say
what
is
not
true
.
''
she
returned
quickly
.
``
No
marriage
is
*NL*
likely
to
take
place
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
now
put
forth
his
unobscured
opinion
,
for
the
moment
had
*NL*
come
.
``
Well
,
Miss
Everdene
,
''
he
said
,
``
putting
aside
what
people
*NL*
say
,
I
never
in
my
life
saw
any
courting
if
his
is
not
a
courting
*NL*
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
would
probably
have
terminated
the
conversation
there
and
*NL*
then
by
flatly
forbidding
the
subject
,
had
not
her
conscious
weakness
*NL*
of
position
allured
her
to
palter
and
argue
in
endeavours
to
better
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
this
subject
has
been
mentioned
,
''
she
said
very
emphatically
,
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
of
the
opportunity
of
clearing
up
a
mistake
which
is
very
*NL*
common
and
very
provoking
.
I
did
n't
definitely
promise
Mr.
Boldwood
*NL*
anything
.
I
have
never
cared
for
him
.
I
respect
him
,
and
he
has
*NL*
urged
me
to
marry
him
.
But
I
have
given
him
no
distinct
answer
.
*NL*
As
soon
as
he
returns
I
shall
do
so
;
and
the
answer
will
be
that
I
*NL*
can
not
think
of
marrying
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
are
full
of
mistakes
,
seemingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
day
they
said
you
were
trifling
with
him
,
and
you
almost
*NL*
proved
that
you
were
not
;
lately
they
have
said
that
you
be
not
,
and
*NL*
you
straightway
begin
to
show
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
am
,
I
suppose
you
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
they
speak
the
truth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
,
but
wrongly
applied
.
I
do
n't
trifle
with
him
;
but
then
,
I
*NL*
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
was
unfortunately
led
on
to
speak
of
Boldwood
's
rival
in
a
wrong
*NL*
tone
to
her
after
all
.
``
I
wish
you
had
never
met
that
young
Sergeant
*NL*
Troy
,
miss
,
''
he
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
steps
became
faintly
spasmodic
.
``
Why
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
good
enough
for
`
ee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
any
one
tell
you
to
speak
to
me
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
it
appears
to
me
that
Sergeant
Troy
does
not
concern
us
here
,
''
*NL*
she
said
,
intractably
.
``
Yet
I
must
say
that
Sergeant
Troy
is
an
*NL*
educated
man
,
and
quite
worthy
of
any
woman
.
He
is
well
born
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
being
higher
in
learning
and
birth
than
the
ruck
o
'
soldiers
*NL*
is
anything
but
a
proof
of
his
worth
.
It
show
's
his
course
to
be
*NL*
down
`
ard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
see
what
this
has
to
do
with
our
conversation
.
Mr.
Troy
's
*NL*
course
is
not
by
any
means
downward
;
and
his
superiority
IS
a
proof
*NL*
of
his
worth
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
him
to
have
no
conscience
at
all
.
And
I
can
not
help
*NL*
begging
you
,

,
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him

Listen
to
me
this
*NL*
once
--
only
this
once

I
do

say
he
's
such
a
bad
man
as
I
have
*NL*
fancied

I
pray
to
God
he
is
not

But
since
we
do
n't
exactly
know
*NL*
what
he
is
,
why
not
behave
as
if
he
MIGHT
be
bad

simply
for
your
own
*NL*
safety

Do

trust
him

I
ask
you
not
to
trust
him
so

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

pray
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
soldiers

but
this
one
I
do

he
said

sturdily

*NL*
``
His
cleverness
in
his
calling
may
have
tempted
him
astray

and
what
*NL*
is
mirth
to
the
neighbours

ruin
to
the
woman
.
When
he
tries
to
*NL*
talk
to
`

again
,
why
not
turn
away
with
a
short
`
Good
day
'
;
and
*NL*
when
you
see
him
coming
one
way
,
turn
the
other

When
he
says

anything
laughable

fail

see
the
point

do
n't
smile

speak
*NL*
of
him
before
those
who
will
report
your
talk
as
`

fantastical

man

harmless-uncivil

rid

*NL*
*NL*
No
Christmas
robin
detained
by
a
window-pane
ever
pulsed
as
did
*NL*
Bathsheba
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
say
--
I
say
again
--
that
it
does
n't
become
you
to
talk
about

he
should
be
mentioned
passes
me
quite
!

she
exclaimed
*NL*
desperately
.
``
I
know
this
,
th-th-that
he
is
a
thoroughly
*NL*
conscientious
man
--
blunt
sometimes
even
to
rudeness

but
always
*NL*
speaking
his
mind
about
you
plain
to
your

*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
``
He

``
I

afeard
nobody

never
did

certainly

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
reason
of
that
is
,
''
she
said
eagerly
,
``
that
he
goes
in
privately
*NL*
by
the
old
tower
door
,
just
when
the
service
commences
,
and
sits
at
*NL*
the
back
of
the
gallery

He
told
me
so

''
*NL*
*NL*
This
supreme
instance
of
Troy
's
goodness
fell
upon
Gabriel
ears
like
*NL*
the
thirteenth
stroke
of
crazy
clock
.
It
was
not
only
received
with
*NL*
utter
incredulity
as
regarded
itself
,
but
threw
a
doubt
on
all
the
*NL*
assurances
that
had
preceded
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
was
grieved
to
find
how
entirely
she
trusted
him
.
He
brimmed
*NL*
with
deep
feeling
as
he
replied
in
a
steady
voice
,
the
steadiness
of
*NL*
which
was
spoilt
by
the
palpableness
of
his
great
effort
to
keep
it
*NL*
so
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
mistress
,
that
I
love
you
,
and
shall
love
you
always
.
*NL*
I
only
mention
this
to
bring
to
your
mind
that
at
any
rate
I
would
*NL*
wish
to
do
you
no
harm
:
beyond
that
I
put
it
aside
.
I
have
lost
in
*NL*
the
race
for
money
and
good
things
,
and
I
am
not
such
a
fool
as
to
*NL*
pretend
to
`
ee
now
I
am
poor
,
and
you
have
got
altogether
above
me
.
*NL*
But
Bathsheba
,
dear
mistress
,
this
I
beg
you
to
consider
--
that
,
both
*NL*
to
keep
yourself
well
honoured
among
the
workfolk
,
and
in

discreet
in
your
bearing
towards
this
soldier

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

she
exclaimed
,
in
a
choking
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
ye
not
more
to
me
than
my
own
affairs

even
life

he
went
*NL*
on
.
``
Come

listen
to
me

I
am
six
years
older
than
you

Mr.
*NL*
Boldwood

ten
years
older

I

I
do
beg
of
`

to
*NL*
consider
before

too
late

how
safe
you

be

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
's
allusion
to
his
own
love
for
her
lessened
,
to
some
extent
,
her
*NL*
anger
at
his
interference
;
but
she
could
not
really
forgive
him
for
*NL*
letting
his
wish
to
marry
her
be
eclipsed
by
his
wish
to
do
her
good
,
*NL*
any
more
than
for
his
slighting
treatment
of
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
to
go
elsewhere
,
''
she
commanded
,
a
paleness
of
face
*NL*
invisible
to
the
eye
being
suggested
by
the
trembling
words
.
``
Do
not
*NL*
remain
on
this
farm
any
longer

I
do
n't
want
you

I
beg
you
to
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nonsense
,
''
said
Oak
,
calmly
.
``
This
is
the
second
time
you
*NL*
have
pretended
to
dismiss
me
;
and
what
's
the
use
o

it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretended
!
You
shall
go
,
sir

your
lecturing
I
will
not
hear

I
am
*NL*
mistress
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
,
indeed

what
folly
will
you
say
next

Treating
me
like
Dick

*NL*
Tom
and
Harry
when
you
know
that
a
short
time
ago
my
position
was
as
*NL*
good
as
yours
!
Upon
my
life
,
Bathsheba
,
it
is
too
barefaced
.
You
*NL*
know
,
too
,
that
I
ca
n't
go
without
putting
things
in
such
a
strait
as
*NL*
you
would
n't
get
out
of
I
ca
n't
tell
when
.
Unless
,
indeed
,
you
'll
*NL*
promise
to
have
an
understanding
man
as
bailiff
,
or
manager
,
or
*NL*
something
.
I
'll
go
at
once
if
you
'll
promise
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
no
bailiff
;
I
shall
continue
to
be
my
own
manager
,
''
she
*NL*
said
decisively
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
;
you
should
be
thankful
to
me
for
biding
.
How
would
*NL*
the
farm
go
on
with
nobody
to
mind
it
but
a
woman
?
But
mind
this
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
wish
`
ee
to
feel
you
owe
me
anything
.
Not
I
.
What
I
do
,
I
do
.
*NL*
Sometimes
I
say
I
should
be
as
glad
as
a
bird
to
leave
the
place
--
for
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
I
'm
content
to
be
a
nobody
.
I
was
made
for
better
*NL*
things
.
However
,
I
do
n't
like
to
see
your
concerns
going
to
ruin
,
as
*NL*
they
must
if
you
keep
in
this
mind
...
I
hate
taking
my
own
measure
*NL*
so
plain
,
but
,
upon
my
life
,
your
provoking
ways
make
a
man
say
*NL*
what
he
would
n't
dream
of
at
other
times
!
I
own
to
being
rather
*NL*
interfering
.
But
you
know
well
enough
how
it
is
,
and
who
she
is
that
*NL*
I
like
too
well
,
and
feel
too
much
like
a
fool
about
to
be
civil
to
*NL*
her
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
more
than
probable
that
she
privately
and
unconsciously
*NL*
respected
him
a
little
for
this
grim
fidelity
,
which
had
been
shown
*NL*
in
his
tone
even
more
than
in
his
words
.
At
any
rate
she
murmured
*NL*
something
to
the
effect
that
he
might
stay
if
he
wished
.
She
said
*NL*
more
distinctly
,
``
Will
you
leave
me
alone
now
?
I
do
n't
order
it
*NL*
as
a
mistress
--
I
ask
it
as
a
woman
,
and
I
expect
you
not
to
be
so
*NL*
uncourteous
as
to
refuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
I
will
,
Miss
Everdene
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
gently
.
He
wondered
*NL*
that
the
request
should
have
come
at
this
moment
,
for
the
strife
was
*NL*
over
,
and
they
were
on
a
most
desolate
hill
,
far
from
every
human
*NL*
habitation
,
and
the
hour
was
getting
late
.
He
stood
still
and
*NL*
allowed
her
to
get
far
ahead
of
him
till
he
could
only
see
her
form
*NL*
upon
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
distressing
explanation
of
this
anxiety
to
be
rid
of
him
at
that
*NL*
point
now
ensued
.
A
figure
apparently
rose
from
the
earth
beside
*NL*
her
.
The
shape
beyond
all
doubt
was
Troy
's
.
Oak
would
not
be
even
*NL*
a
possible
listener
,
and
at
once
turned
back
till
a
good
two
hundred
*NL*
yards
were
between
the
lovers
and
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
went
home
by
way
of
the
churchyard
.
In
passing
the
tower
*NL*
he
thought
of
what
she
had
said
about
the
sergeant
's
virtuous
habit
*NL*
of
entering
the
church
unperceived
at
the
beginning
of
service
.
*NL*
Believing
that
the
little
gallery
door
alluded
to
was
quite
disused
,
*NL*
he
ascended
the
external
flight
of
steps
at
the
top
of
which
*NL*
it
stood
,
and
examined
it
.
The
pale
lustre
yet
hanging
in
the
*NL*
north-western
heaven
was
sufficient
to
show
that
a
sprig
of
ivy
had
*NL*
grown
from
the
wall
across
the
door
to
a
length
of
more
than
a
foot
,
*NL*
delicately
tying
the
panel
to
the
stone
jamb
.
It
was
a
decisive
*NL*
proof
that
the
door
had
not
been
opened
at
least
since
Troy
came
back
*NL*
to
Weatherbury
.

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HOT
CHEEKS
AND
TEARFUL
EYES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
later
Bathsheba
entered
her
own
house
.
There
burnt
*NL*
upon
her
face
when
she
met
the
light
of
the
candles
the
flush
and
*NL*
excitement
which
were
little
less
than
chronic
with
her
now
.
The
*NL*
farewell
words
of
Troy
,
who
had
accompanied
her
to
the
very
door
,
*NL*
still
lingered
in
her
ears
.
He
had
bidden
her
adieu
for
two
days
,
*NL*
which
were
,
so
he
stated
,
to
be
spent
at
Bath
in
visiting
some
*NL*
friends
.
He
had
also
kissed
her
a
second
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
only
fair
to
Bathsheba
to
explain
here
a
little
fact
which
*NL*
did
not
come
to
light
till
a
long
time
afterwards
:
that
Troy
's
*NL*
presentation
of
himself
so
aptly
at
the
roadside
this
evening
was
*NL*
not
by
any
distinctly
preconcerted
arrangement
.
He
had
hinted
--
she
*NL*
had
forbidden
;
and
it
was
only
on
the
chance
of
his
still
coming
*NL*
that
she
had
dismissed
Oak
,
fearing
a
meeting
between
them
just
*NL*
then
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
now
sank
down
into
a
chair
,
wild
and
perturbed
by
all
these
*NL*
new
and
fevering
sequences
.
Then
she
jumped
up
with
a
manner
of
*NL*
decision
,
and
fetched
her
desk
from
a
side
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
three
minutes
,
without
pause
or
modification
,
she
had
written
a
*NL*
letter
to
Boldwood
,
at
his
address
beyond
Casterbridge
,
saying
mildly
*NL*
but
firmly
that
she
had
well
considered
the
whole
subject
he
had
*NL*
brought
before
her
and
kindly
given
her
time
to
decide
upon
;
that
*NL*
her
final
decision
was
that
she
could
not
marry
him
.
She
had
*NL*
expressed
to
Oak
an
intention
to
wait
till
Boldwood
came
home
before
*NL*
communicating
to
him
her
conclusive
reply
.
But
Bathsheba
found
that
*NL*
she
could
not
wait
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
to
send
this
letter
till
the
next
day
;
yet
to
quell
*NL*
her
uneasiness
by
getting
it
out
of
her
hands
,
and
so
,
as
it
were
,
*NL*
setting
the
act
in
motion
at
once
,
she
arose
to
take
it
to
any
one
of
*NL*
the
women
who
might
be
in
the
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paused
in
the
passage
.
A
dialogue
was
going
on
in
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
and
Bathsheba
and
Troy
were
the
subject
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
marry
her
,
she
'll
gie
up
farming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twill
be
a
gallant
life
,
but
may
bring
some
trouble
between
the
*NL*
mirth
--
so
say
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
wish
I
had
half
such
a
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
had
too
much
sense
to
mind
seriously
what
her
servitors
*NL*
said
about
her
;
but
too
much
womanly
redundance
of
speech
to
leave
*NL*
alone
what
was
said
till
it
died
the
natural
death
of
unminded
*NL*
things
.
She
burst
in
upon
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
are
you
speaking
of
?
''
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
pause
before
anybody
replied
.
At
last
Liddy
said
*NL*
frankly
,
``
What
was
passing
was
a
bit
of
a
word
about
yourself
,
miss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
!
Maryann
and
Liddy
and
Temperance
--
now
I
forbid
you
*NL*
to
suppose
such
things
.
You
know
I
do
n't
care
the
least
for
Mr.
*NL*
Troy
--
not
I.
Everybody
knows
how
much
I
hate
him
.
--
Yes
,
''
repeated
*NL*
the
froward
young
person
,
``
HATE
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
know
you
do
,
miss

''
said
Liddy
;
``
and
so
do
we
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
him
too
,
''
said
Maryann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maryann
--
Oh
you
perjured
woman
!
How
can
you
speak
that
wicked
*NL*
story
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
excitedly
.
``
You
admired
him
from
your
heart
*NL*
only
this
morning
in
the
very
world

did

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

but
so
did
you
.
He
is
a
wild
scamp
now
,
and
you
are
*NL*
right
to
hate
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
NOT
a
wild
scamp
!
How
dare
you
to
my
face
!
I
have
no
right
to
*NL*
hate
him
,
nor
you
,
nor
anybody

But
I
am
a
silly
woman
!
What
is
it
*NL*
to
me
what
he
is

You
know
it
is
nothing
.
I
do
n't
care
for
him
;
I
*NL*
do
n't
mean
to
defend
his
good
name
,
not
I.
Mind
this
,
if
any
of
you
*NL*
say
a
word
against
him
you
'll
be
dismissed
instantly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
down
the
letter
and
surged
back
into
the
parlour
,
with
a
*NL*
big
heart
and
tearful
eyes
,
Liddy
following
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
miss
!
''
said
mild
Liddy
,
looking
pitifully
into
Bathsheba
's
face
.
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
we
mistook
you
so
!
I
did
think
you
cared
for
him

but
I
*NL*
see
you
do
n't
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shut
the
door

Liddy

''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
closed
the
door
,
and
went
on
:
``
People
always

such
foolery

I
'll
say
it
out
in
plain
black
and
white

*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
burst
out
:
``
O
Liddy

are
you
such
a
simpleton

*NL*
Liddy
's
clear
eyes
rounded
with
wonderment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
must
be

she
said
,
in
reckless

abandonment
and
grief

enough

She
*NL*
put
her
arms
round
Liddy
's
neck
.
``
I
must
let
it
out

went
towards

door

*NL*
``

back

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

him

be
so
bad

make
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
bad
at
all

My

am

she
moaned
,
in
a
relaxed
,
desultory
way
,
heedless
of
Liddy
's
*NL*
presence
.
``
Oh
,
how
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
him
!
Loving
is
misery
*NL*
for
women
always

I
shall
never
forgive
God
for
making
me
a
woman

dearly

I
beginning

for
the
honour
of

pretty

face

She
freshened
and
turned
to
Liddy
suddenly
.
``
Mind
this
,
*NL*
Lydia
Smallbury
,
if
you
repeat
anywhere
a
single
word
of
what
I
have
*NL*
said
to
you
inside
this
closed
door

I
'll
never
trust
you

love
*NL*
you

have
you
with
me
a
moment
longer

not
a
moment

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
repeat
anything
,

said
Liddy
,
with
womanly
dignity
*NL*
of
a
diminutive
order
;
``
but
I
do
n't
wish
to
stay
with
you

And
,
*NL*
if
you
please
,
I
'll
go
at
the
end
of
the
harvest

or
this
week

*NL*
to-day

I
do
n't
see
that
I

put
upon

stormed
at

for
nothing

concluded
the
small
woman
,
bigly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Liddy
;
you
must
stay
!

said
Bathsheba
,
dropping
from
*NL*
haughtiness
to
entreaty
with
capricious
inconsequence
.
``
You
must
not
*NL*
notice
my
being
in
a
taking
just
now

You
are
not
as

a
companion

me

Dear

dear

I
do

what
I
am
doing

since
this
miserable
ache
of
my
heart
has
weighted

worn
upon
me
*NL*
so
!
What
shall
I
come
to
!
I
suppose
I
shall
get
further
and
further
*NL*
into
troubles
.
I
wonder
sometimes
if
I
am
doomed

die
in
the
*NL*
Union

I
am
friendless
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wo

anything

will

leave
you

sobbed
Liddy
,
*NL*
impulsively
putting
up
her
lips
to
Bathsheba
's
,
and
kissing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Bathsheba
kissed
Liddy
,
and
all
was
smooth
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
often
cry

I

Lidd

you

into

she
said
,
a
smile
shining
through
the
moisture
.
``
Try
to
think

him

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is

better

to
be
as
some
are

wild
in

steady
way

I
am
afraid

how
I

no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Death

himself

n't
wring
it
from

I

*NL*
a
mind
to
keep
anything

and
I
'll
always
be
your

''
replied
*NL*
Liddy
,
emphatically
,
at
the
same
time
bringing
a
few
more
tears
into
*NL*
her
own
eyes
,
not
from
any
particular
necessity
,
but
from
an
artistic
*NL*
sense
of
making
herself
in
keeping
with
the
remainder
of
the
picture
,
*NL*
which
seems
to
influence
women
at
such
times
.
``
I
think
God
likes
us
*NL*
to
be
good
friends

do

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

*NL*

at

you
seem
to
swell
so
tall
as
a
lion
then
,
and
it
frightens
*NL*
me
!
Do
you
know

I
fancy
you
would
be
a
match

any

are
in
one
o

your

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
!
do
you
?
''
said
Bathsheba
,
slightly
laughing
,
though
somewhat
*NL*
seriously
alarmed
by
this
Amazonian
picture
of
herself
.
``
I
hope
I
am
*NL*
not
a
bold
sort
of
maid

mannish
?

she
continued
with
some
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
not
mannish
;
but
so
almighty
womanish
that
't
is
getting
on
*NL*
that
way
sometimes
.
Ah
!
miss

''
she
said
,
after
having
drawn
her
*NL*
breath
very
sadly
in
and
sent
it
very
sadly
out
,
``
I
wish
I
had
half
*NL*
your
failing
that

'T
is
a
great

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BLAME
--
FURY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
evening
Bathsheba
,
with
the
idea
of
getting
out
of
the
way
*NL*
of
Mr.
Boldwood
in
the
event
of
his
returning
to
answer
her
note
*NL*
in
person
,
proceeded
to
fulfil
an
engagement
made
with
Liddy
some
*NL*
few
hours
earlier
.
Bathsheba
's
companion
,
as
a
gauge
of
their
*NL*
reconciliation
,
had
been
granted
a
week
's
holiday
to
visit
her
*NL*
sister
,
who
was
married
to
a
thriving
hurdler
and
cattle-crib-maker
*NL*
living
in
a
delightful
labyrinth
of
hazel
copse
not
far
beyond
*NL*
Yalbury
.
The
arrangement
was
that
Miss
Everdene
should
honour
*NL*
them
by
coming
there
for
a
day
or
two
to
inspect
some
ingenious
*NL*
contrivances
which
this
man
of
the
woods
had
introduced
into
his
*NL*
wares
.
*NL*
*NL*
Leaving
her
instructions
with
Gabriel
and
Maryann
,
that
they
were
to
*NL*
see
everything
carefully
locked
up
for
the
night
,
she
went
out
of
the
*NL*
house
just
at
the
close
of
a
timely
thunder-shower
,
which
had
refined
*NL*
the
air
,
and
daintily
bathed
the
coat
of
the
land
,
though
all
beneath
*NL*
was
dry
as
ever
.
Freshness
was
exhaled
in
an
essence
from
the
varied
*NL*
contours
of
bank
and
hollow
,
as
if
the
earth
breathed
maiden
breath
;
*NL*
and
the
pleased
birds
were
hymning
to
the
scene
.
Before
her
,
among
*NL*
the
clouds
,
there
was
a
contrast
in
the
shape
of
lairs
of
fierce
*NL*
light
which
showed
themselves
in
the
neighbourhood
of
a
hidden
sun
,
*NL*
lingering
on
to
the
farthest
north-west
corner
of
the
heavens
that
*NL*
this
midsummer
season
allowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
walked
nearly
two
miles
of
her
journey
,
watching
how
the
*NL*
day
was
retreating
,
and
thinking
how
the
time
of
deeds
was
quietly
*NL*
melting
into
the
time
of
thought
,
to
give
place
in
its
turn
to
the
*NL*
time
of
prayer
and
sleep
,
when
she
beheld
advancing
over
Yalbury
*NL*
hill
the
very
man
she
sought
so
anxiously
to
elude
.
Boldwood
was
*NL*
stepping
on
,
not
with
that
quiet
tread
of
reserved
strength
which
*NL*
was
his
customary
gait
,
in
which
he
always
seemed
to
be
balancing
*NL*
two
thoughts
.
His
manner
was
stunned
and
sluggish
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
had
for
the
first
time
been
awakened
to
woman
's
privileges
*NL*
in
tergiversation
even
when
it
involves
another
person
's
possible
*NL*
blight
.
That
Bathsheba
was
a
firm
and
positive
girl
,
far
less
*NL*
inconsequent
than
her
fellows
,
had
been
the
very
lung
of
his
hope
;
*NL*
for
he
had
held
that
these
qualities
would
lead
her
to
adhere
to
a
*NL*
straight
course
for
consistency
's
sake
,
and
accept
him
,
though
her
*NL*
fancy
might
not
flood
him
with
the
iridescent
hues
of
uncritical
*NL*
love
.
But
the
argument
now
came
back
as
sorry
gleams
from
a
broken
*NL*
mirror
.
The
discovery
was
no
less
a
scourge
than
a
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
on
looking
upon
the
ground
,
and
did
not
see
Bathsheba
till
*NL*
they
were
less
than
a
stone
's
throw
apart
.
He
looked
up
at
the
sound
*NL*
of
her
pit-pat
,
and
his
changed
appearance
sufficiently
denoted
to
*NL*
her
the
depth
and
strength
of
the
feelings
paralyzed
by
her
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
;
is
it
you
,
Mr.
Boldwood
?
''
she
faltered
,
a
guilty
warmth
pulsing
*NL*
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
who
have
the
power
of
reproaching
in
silence
may
find
it
a
*NL*
means
more
effective
than
words
.
There
are
accents
in
the
eye
which
*NL*
are
not
on
the
tongue
,
and
more
tales
come
from
pale
lips
than
can
*NL*
enter
an
ear
.
It
is
both
the
grandeur
and
the
pain
of
the
remoter
*NL*
moods
that
they
avoid
the
pathway
of
sound
.
Boldwood
's
look
was
*NL*
unanswerable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Seeing
she
turned
a
little
aside
,
he
said
,
``
What
,
are
you
afraid
of
*NL*
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
say
that
?
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancied
you
looked
so
,
''
said
he
.
``
And
it
is
most
strange
,
because
*NL*
of
its
contrast
with
my
feeling
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
regained
self-possession
,
fixed
her
eyes
calmly
,
and
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
what
that
feeling
is
,
''
continued
Boldwood
,
deliberately
.
*NL*
``
A
thing
strong
as
death
.
No
dismissal
by
a
hasty
letter
affects
*NL*
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
did
not
feel
so
strongly
about
me
,
''
she
murmured
.
``
It
is
*NL*
generous
of
you
,
and
more
than
I
deserve
,
but
I
must
not
hear
it
*NL*
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hear
it
?
What
do
you
think
I
have
to
say
,
then
?
I
am
not
to
marry
*NL*
you
,
and
that
's
enough
.
Your
letter
was
excellently
plain
.
I
want
*NL*
you
to
hear
nothing
--
not
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
unable
to
direct
her
will
into
any
definite
groove
for
*NL*
freeing
herself
from
this
fearfully
awkward
position
.
She
confusedly
*NL*
said
,
``
Good
evening
,
''
and
was
moving
on
.
Boldwood
walked
up
to
her
*NL*
heavily
and
dully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bathsheba
--
darling
--
is
it
final
indeed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Bathsheba
--
have
pity
upon
me
!
''
Boldwood
burst
out
.
``
God
's
sake
,
*NL*
yes
--
I
am
come
to
that
low
,
lowest
stage
--
to
ask
a
woman
for
pity
!
*NL*
Still
,
she
is
you
--
she
is
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
commanded
herself
well
.
But
she
could
hardly
get
a
clear
*NL*
voice
for
what
came
instinctively
to
her
lips
:
``
There
is
little
*NL*
honour
to
the
woman
in
that
speech
.
''
It
was
only
whispered
,
for
*NL*
something
unutterably
mournful
no
less
than
distressing
in
this
*NL*
spectacle
of
a
man
showing
himself
to
be
so
entirely
the
vane
of
a
*NL*
passion
enervated
the
feminine
instinct
for
punctilios
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
beyond
myself
about
this
,
and
am
mad
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
am
no
stoic
*NL*
at
all
to
be
supplicating
here
;
but
I
do
supplicate
to
you
.
I
wish
*NL*
you
knew
what
is
in
me
of
devotion
to
you
;
but
it
is
impossible
,
*NL*
that
.
In
bare
human
mercy
to
a
lonely
man
,
do
n't
throw
me
off
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
throw
you
off
--
indeed
,
how
can
I
?
I
never
had
you
.
''
In
her
*NL*
noon-clear
sense
that
she
had
never
loved
him
she
forgot
for
a
moment
*NL*
her
thoughtless
angle
on
that
day
in
February
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
was
a
time
when
you
turned
to
me
,
before
I
thought
of
you
!
*NL*
I
do
n't
reproach
you
,
for
even
now
I
feel
that
the
ignorant
and
cold
*NL*
darkness
that
I
should
have
lived
in
if
you
had
not
attracted
me
by
*NL*
that
letter
--
valentine
you
call
it
--
would
have
been
worse
than
my
*NL*
knowledge
of
you
,
though
it
has
brought
this
misery
.
But
,
I
say
,
*NL*
there
was
a
time
when
I
knew
nothing
of
you
,
and
cared
nothing
*NL*
for
you
,
and
yet
you
drew
me
on
.
And
if
you
say
you
gave
me
no
*NL*
encouragement
,
I
can
not
but
contradict
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
call
encouragement
was
the
childish
game
of
an
idle
minute
.
*NL*
I
have
bitterly
repented
of
it
--
ay
,
bitterly
,
and
in
tears
.
Can
you
*NL*
still
go
on
reminding
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
accuse
you
of
it
--
I
deplore
it
.
I
took
for
earnest
what
*NL*
you
insist
was
jest
,
and
now
this
that
I
pray
to
be
jest
you
say
is
*NL*
awful
,
wretched
earnest
.
Our
moods
meet
at
wrong
places

I
wish
*NL*
your
feeling
was
more
like
mine
,
or
my
feeling
more
like
yours

Oh
,
*NL*
could
I
but
have
foreseen
the
torture
that
trifling
trick
was
going
*NL*
to
lead
me
into
,
how
I
should
have
cursed
you
;
but
only
having
been
*NL*
able
to
see
it
since
,
I
can
not
do
that

for
I
love
you
too
well

But
*NL*
it
is
weak
,
idle
drivelling
to
go
on
like
this

Bathsheba

you
*NL*
are
the
first
woman
of
any
shade
or
nature
that
I
have
ever
looked
at
*NL*
to
love
,
and
it
is
the
having
been
so
near
claiming
you
for
my
own
*NL*
that
makes
this
denial
so
hard
to
bear
.
How
nearly
you
promised
me
!
*NL*
But
I
do
n't
speak
now
to
move
your
heart
,
and
make
you
grieve
because
*NL*
of
my
pain
;
it
is
no
use
,
that

I
must
bear
it
;
my
pain
would

no
*NL*
less
by
paining
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
pity
you
--
deeply
--
O
,
so
deeply
!
''
she
earnestly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
no
such
thing
--
do
no
such
thing

Your
dear
love
,
Bathsheba
,
is
*NL*
such
a
vast
thing
beside
your
pity
,
that
the
loss
of
your
pity
as
*NL*
well
as
your
love
is
no
great
addition
to
my
sorrow
,
nor
does
the
*NL*
gain
of
your
pity
make
it
sensibly
less
.
O
sweet
--
how
dearly
you
*NL*
spoke
to
me
behind
the
spear-bed
at
the
washing-pool
,
and
in
the
barn
*NL*
at
the
shearing
,
and
that
dearest
last
time
in
the
evening
at
your
*NL*
home
!
Where
are
your
pleasant
words
all
gone
--
your
earnest
hope
to
*NL*
be
able
to
love
me
?
Where
is
your
firm
conviction
that
you
would
get
*NL*
to
care
for
me
very
much
?
Really
forgotten
?
--
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
checked
emotion
,
looked
him
quietly
and
clearly
in
the
face
,
and
*NL*
said
in
her
low
,
firm
voice
,
``
Mr.
Boldwood
,
I
promised
you
nothing
.
*NL*
Would
you
have
had
me
a
woman
of
clay
when
you
paid
me
that
furthest
,
*NL*
highest
compliment
a
man
can
pay
a
woman
--
telling
her
he
loves
her
?
*NL*
I
was
bound
to
show
some
feeling
,
if
I
would
not
be
a
graceless
*NL*
shrew
.
Yet
each
of
those
pleasures
was
just
for
the
day
--
the
day
*NL*
just
for
the
pleasure
.
How
was
I
to
know
that
what
is
a
pastime
to
*NL*
all
other
men
was
death
to
you
?
Have
reason
,
do
,
and
think
more
*NL*
kindly
of
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
never
mind
arguing
--
never
mind
.
One
thing
is
sure
:
you
*NL*
were
all
but
mine
,
and
now
you
are
not
nearly
mine
.
Everything
is
*NL*
changed
,
and
that
by
you
alone
,
remember
.
You
were
nothing
to
me
*NL*
once
,
and
I
was
contented
;
you
are
now
nothing
to
me
again
,
and
how
*NL*
different
the
second
nothing
is
from
the
first
!
Would
to
God
you
*NL*
had
never
taken
me
up
,
since
it
was
only
to
throw
me
down
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
in
spite
of
her
mettle
,
began
to
feel
unmistakable
signs
*NL*
that
she
was
inherently
the
weaker
vessel
.
She
strove
miserably
*NL*
against
this
femininity
which
would
insist
upon
supplying
unbidden
*NL*
emotions
in
stronger
and
stronger
current
.
She
had
tried
to
elude
*NL*
agitation
by
fixing
her
mind
on
the
trees
,
sky
,
any
trivial
object
*NL*
before
her
eyes
,
whilst
his
reproaches
fell
,
but
ingenuity
could
not
*NL*
save
her
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
take
you
up
--
surely
I
did
not
!
''
she
answered
as
heroically
*NL*
as
she
could
.
``
But
do
n't
be
in
this
mood
with
me

I
can
endure
*NL*
being
told
I
am
in
the
wrong
,
if
you
will
only
tell
it
me
gently
!
*NL*
O
sir
,
will
you
not
kindly
forgive
me
,
and
look
at
it
cheerfully
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheerfully
!
Can
a
man
fooled
to
utter
heart-burning
find
a
reason
*NL*
for
being
merry

If
I
have
lost
,
how
can
I
be
as
if
I
had
won
?
*NL*
Heavens
you
must
be
heartless
quite
!
Had
I
known
what
a
fearfully
*NL*
bitter
sweet
this
was
to
be
,
how
I
would
have
avoided
you
,
and
never
*NL*
seen
you
,
and
been
deaf
of
you

I
tell
you
all
this

what
do
you
*NL*
care

You
do
n't
care

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
silent
and
weak
denials
to
his
charges
,
and
swayed
*NL*
her
head
desperately
,
as
if
to
thrust
away
the
words
as
they
came
*NL*
showering
about
her
ears
from
the
lips
of
the
trembling
man
in
the
*NL*
climax
of
life
,
with
his
bronzed
Roman
face
and
fine
frame
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
,
dearest
,
I
am
wavering
even
now
between
the
two
opposites
*NL*
of
recklessly
renouncing
you

labouring
humbly
for
you
again
.
*NL*
Forget
that
you
have
said
No
,
and
let
it
be
as
it
was
!
Say
,
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
that
you
only
wrote
that
refusal
to
me
in
fun
--
come
,
say
*NL*
it
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
untrue
,
and
painful
to
both
of
us

You
overrate
my
*NL*
capacity
for
love

I
do
n't
possess
half
the
warmth
of
nature
you
*NL*
believe
me
to
have
.
An
unprotected
childhood
in
a
cold
world
has
*NL*
beaten
gentleness
out
of
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
immediately
said
with
more
resentment
:
``
That
may
be
true
,
*NL*
somewhat
;

ah
,
Miss
Everdene

You

*NL*
not
the
cold
woman

would
have
me

No

no
!
It
is
n't
*NL*
because
you
have
no
feeling
in
you
that
you
do
n't
love
me

You
*NL*
naturally
would
have
me
think
so

you
would
hide
from
me
that
you
*NL*
have
a
burning
heart
like
mine
.
You
have
love
enough
,
but
it
is
*NL*
turned
into
a
new
channel

I
know
where

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
swift
music
of
her
heart
became
hubbub
now
,
and
she
throbbed
*NL*
to
extremity
.
He
was
coming
to
Troy
.
He
did
then
know
what
had
*NL*
occurred
!
And
the
name
fell
from
his
lips
the
next
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
Troy
not
leave
my
treasure
alone
?
''
he
asked
,
fiercely
.
*NL*
``
When
I
had
no
thought
of
injuring
him
,
why
did
he
force
himself
upon
*NL*
your
notice

Before
he
worried
you
your
inclination
was
to
have
me
;
*NL*
when
next
I
should
have
come
to
you
your
answer
would
have
been
Yes
.
*NL*
Can
you
deny
it
--
I
ask
,
can
you
deny
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
delayed
the
reply
,
but
was
too
honest
to
withhold
it
.
``
I
*NL*
can
not
,
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
you
can
not

But
he
stole
in

win
you
away
before

when
nobody

Now
the

sneer
at

the
very
hills

seem
to
laugh
at

*NL*
*NL*
His
unreasonable
anger
terrified
her

she
glided
from
him

without
obviously
moving

as
she
said
,

Dazzled

She
fired
up
at
once

much
upon

she

said
,
vehemently

no

Yes

*NL*
*NL*
The
most
tragic
woman
is
cowed
by
a
tragic
man
,
and
although
Boldwood
*NL*
was
,
in
vehemence
and
glow
,
nearly
her
own
self
rendered
into
another
*NL*
sex

Bathsheba
's
cheek
quivered
.
She
gasped
,
``
Leave

hoarsely
from

*NL*
``

slowly

in

defiantly

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then

Boldwood

breaking
into
a

whispered
fury

``

come

will
have
to
repent

and
think
wretchedly
of
the
pain

has
*NL*
caused
another
man

and
then
may
he
ache

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do

implored
in
a
*NL*
miserable
cry

``
Anything

*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
's
ideas
had
reached
that
point
of
fusion
at
which
outline
*NL*
and
consistency
entirely
disappear
.
The
impending
night
appeared
to
*NL*
concentrate
in
his
eye
.
He
did
not
hear
her
at
all
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

'll
punish
him

by
my
soul

no

and
I
'll
horsewhip
the
untimely
stripling
for
this
reckless
theft
*NL*
of
my
one
delight

If
he
were
a
hundred
men
I
'd
horsewhip

*NL*
He
dropped
his
voice
suddenly
and
unnaturally
.
``
Bathsheba

sweet
,
*NL*
lost
coquette

been
blaming

*NL*
behaving

a
churl
to

the
greatest
sinner

*NL*
stole
your

heart
away
with
his
unfathomable
lies

It
is
a

fortunate
thing

gone
back

away
up
the
country

yet

I
pray
God

for
I
may
*NL*
be
tempted
beyond
myself

Oh
,
Bathsheba
,
keep
him
away
--
yes
,
keep
*NL*
him
away
from
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
Boldwood
stood
so
inertly
after
this
that
his
soul
*NL*
seemed
to
have
been
entirely
exhaled
with
the
breath
of
his
*NL*
passionate
words
.
He
turned
his
face
away
,
and
withdrew
,
and
his
*NL*
form
was
soon
covered
over
by
the
twilight
as
his
footsteps
mixed
*NL*
in
with
the
low
hiss
of
the
leafy
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
who
had
been
standing
motionless
as
a
model
all
this
*NL*
latter
time
,
flung
her
hands
to
her
face
,
and
wildly
attempted
to
*NL*
ponder
on
the
exhibition
which
had
just
passed
away
.
Such
astounding
*NL*
wells
of
fevered
feeling
in
a
still
man
like
Mr.
Boldwood
were
*NL*
incomprehensible
,
dreadful
.
Instead
of
being
a
man
trained
to
*NL*
repression
he
was
--
what
she
had
seen
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
force
of
the
farmer
's
threats
lay
in
their
relation
to
a
*NL*
circumstance
known
at
present
only
to
herself
:
her
lover
was
coming
*NL*
back
to
Weatherbury
in
the
course
of
the
very
next
day
or
two
.
Troy
*NL*
had
not
returned
to
his
distant
barracks
as
Boldwood
and
others
*NL*
supposed
,
but
had
merely
gone
to
visit
some
acquaintance
in
Bath
,
*NL*
and
had
yet
a
week
or
more
remaining
to
his
furlough
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
wretchedly
certain
that
if
he
revisited
her
just
at
this
*NL*
nick
of
time
,
and
came
into
contact
with
Boldwood
,
a
fierce
quarrel
*NL*
would
be
the
consequence
.
She
panted
with
solicitude
when
she
*NL*
thought
of
possible
injury
to
Troy
.
The
least
spark
would
kindle
*NL*
the
farmer
's
swift
feelings
of
rage
and
jealousy
;
he
would
lose
his
*NL*
self-mastery
as
he
had
this
evening
;
Troy
's
blitheness
might
become
*NL*
aggressive
;
it
might
take
the
direction
of
derision
,
and
Boldwood
's
*NL*
anger
might
then
take
the
direction
of
revenge
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
almost
a
morbid
dread
of
being
thought
a
gushing
girl
,
this
*NL*
guileless
woman
too
well
concealed
from
the
world
under
a
manner
of
*NL*
carelessness
the
warm
depths
of
her
strong
emotions
.
But
now
there
*NL*
was
no
reserve
.
In
her
distraction
,
instead
of
advancing
further
she
*NL*
walked
up
and
down
,
beating
the
air
with
her
fingers
,
pressing
on
her
*NL*
brow
,
and
sobbing
brokenly
to
herself
.
Then
she
sat
down
on
a
heap
*NL*
of
stones
by
the
wayside
to
think
.
There
she
remained
long
.
Above
*NL*
the
dark
margin
of
the
earth
appeared
foreshores
and
promontories
of
*NL*
coppery
cloud
,
bounding
a
green
and
pellucid
expanse
in
the
western
*NL*
sky
.
Amaranthine
glosses
came
over
them
then
,
and
the
unresting
*NL*
world
wheeled
her
round
to
a
contrasting
prospect
eastward
,
in
the
*NL*
shape
of
indecisive
and
palpitating
stars
.
She
gazed
upon
their
*NL*
silent
throes
amid
the
shades
of
space
,
but
realised
none
at
all
.
*NL*
Her
troubled
spirit
was
far
away
with
Troy

CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
NIGHT
--
HORSES
TRAMPING
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
village
of
Weatherbury
was
quiet
as
the
graveyard
in
its
midst
,
*NL*
and
the
living
were
lying
well-nigh
as
still
as
the
dead
.
The
church
*NL*
clock
struck
eleven
.
The
air
was
so
empty
of
other
sounds
that
the
*NL*
whirr
of
the
clock-work
immediately
before
the
strokes
was
distinct
,
*NL*
and
so
was
also
the
click
of
the
same
at
their
close
.
The
notes
flew
*NL*
forth
with
the
usual
blind
obtuseness
of
inanimate
things
--
flapping
*NL*
and
rebounding
among
walls
,
undulating
against
the
scattered
clouds
,
*NL*
spreading
through
their
interstices
into
unexplored
miles
of
space
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
crannied
and
mouldy
halls
were
to-night
occupied
only
by
*NL*
Maryann
,
Liddy
being
,
as
was
stated
,
with
her
sister
,
whom
Bathsheba
*NL*
had
set
out
to
visit
.
A
few
minutes
after
eleven
had
struck
,
Maryann
*NL*
turned
in
her
bed
with
a
sense
of
being
disturbed
.
She
was
totally
*NL*
unconscious
of
the
nature
of
the
interruption
to
her
sleep
.
It
led
*NL*
to
a
dream
,
and
the
dream
to
an
awakening
,
with
an
uneasy
sensation
*NL*
that
something
had
happened
.
She
left
her
bed
and
looked
out
of
the
*NL*
window
.
The
paddock
abutted
on
this
end
of
the
building
,
and
in
the
*NL*
paddock
she
could
just
discern
by
the
uncertain
gray
a
moving
figure
*NL*
approaching
the
horse
that
was
feeding
there
.
The
figure
seized
the
*NL*
horse
by
the
forelock
,
and
led
it
to
the
corner
of
the
field
.
Here
*NL*
she
could
see
some
object
which
circumstances
proved
to
be
a
vehicle
,
*NL*
for
after
a
few
minutes
spent
apparently
in
harnessing
,
she
heard
the
*NL*
trot
of
the
horse
down
the
road
,
mingled
with
the
sound
of
light
*NL*
wheels
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
varieties
only
of
humanity
could
have
entered
the
paddock
with
*NL*
the
ghostlike
glide
of
that
mysterious
figure
.
They
were
a
woman
and
*NL*
a
gipsy
man
.
A
woman
was
out
of
the
question
in
such
an
occupation
*NL*
at
this
hour
,
and
the
comer
could
be
no
less
than
a
thief
,
who
might
*NL*
probably
have
known
the
weakness
of
the
household
on
this
particular
*NL*
night
,
and
have
chosen
it
on
that
account
for
his
daring
attempt
.
*NL*
Moreover
,
to
raise
suspicion
to
conviction
itself
,
there
were
gipsies
*NL*
in
Weatherbury
Bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maryann
,
who
had
been
afraid
to
shout
in
the
robber
's
presence
,
*NL*
having
seen
him
depart
had
no
fear
.
She
hastily
slipped
on
her
*NL*
clothes
,
stumped
down
the
disjointed
staircase
with
its
hundred
*NL*
creaks
,
ran
to
Coggan
's
,
the
nearest
house
,
and
raised
an
alarm
.
*NL*
Coggan
called
Gabriel
,
who
now
again
lodged
in
his
house
as
at
first
,
*NL*
and
together
they
went
to
the
paddock
.
Beyond
all
doubt
the
horse
*NL*
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hark
!
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
listened
.
Distinct
upon
the
stagnant
air
came
the
sounds
of
a
*NL*
trotting
horse
passing
up
Longpuddle
Lane
--
just
beyond
the
gipsies
'
*NL*
encampment
in
Weatherbury
Bottom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
our
Dainty
--
I
'll
swear
to
her
step
,
''
said
Jan.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mighty
me
!
Wo
n't
mis
`
ess
storm
and
call
us
stupids
when
she
comes
*NL*
back
!
''
moaned
Maryann
.
``
How
I
wish
it
had
happened
when
she
was
at
*NL*
home
,
and
none
of
us
had
been
answerable
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
ride
after
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
decisively
.
``
I
'll
be
*NL*
responsible
to
Miss
Everdene
for
what
we
do
.
Yes
,
we
'll
follow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith
,
I
do
n't
see
how
,
''
said
Coggan
.
``
All
our
horses
are
too
heavy
*NL*
for
that
trick
except
little
Poppet
,
and
what
's
she
between
two
of
*NL*
us
?
--
If
we
only
had
that
pair
over
the
hedge
we
might
do
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
pair
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Boldwood
's
Tidy
and
Moll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
wait
here
till
I
come
hither
again
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
He
ran
down
*NL*
the
hill
towards
Farmer
Boldwood
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farmer
Boldwood
is
not
at
home
,
''
said
Maryann
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
the
better
,
''
said
Coggan
.
``
I
know
what
he
's
gone
for
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Less
than
five
minutes
brought
up
Oak
again
,
running
at
the
same
*NL*
pace
,
with
two
halters
dangling
from
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
did
you
find
'em
?
''
said
Coggan
,
turning
round
and
leaping
upon
*NL*
the
hedge
without
waiting
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
eaves
.
I
knew
where
they
were
kept
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
*NL*
following
him
.
``
Coggan
,
you
can
ride
bare-backed
?
there
's
no
time
to
*NL*
look
for
saddles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
a
hero
!
''
said
Jan.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maryann
,
you
go
to
bed
,
''
Gabriel
shouted
to
her
from
the
top
of
the
*NL*
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Springing
down
into
Boldwood
's
pastures
,
each
pocketed
his
halter
to
*NL*
hide
it
from
the
horses
,
who
,
seeing
the
men
empty-handed
,
docilely
*NL*
allowed
themselves
to
be
seized
by
the
mane
,
when
the
halters
were
*NL*
dexterously
slipped
on
.
Having
neither
bit
nor
bridle
,
Oak
and
*NL*
Coggan
extemporized
the
former
by
passing
the
rope
in
each
case
*NL*
through
the
animal
's
mouth
and
looping
it
on
the
other
side
.
Oak
*NL*
vaulted
astride
,
and
Coggan
clambered
up
by
aid
of
the
bank
,
when
*NL*
they
ascended
to
the
gate
and
galloped
off
in
the
direction
taken
by
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
horse
and
the
robber
.
Whose
vehicle
the
horse
had
been
*NL*
harnessed
to
was
a
matter
of
some
uncertainty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Weatherbury
Bottom
was
reached
in
three
or
four
minutes
.
They
*NL*
scanned
the
shady
green
patch
by
the
roadside
.
The
gipsies
were
*NL*
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
villains
!
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
Which
way
have
they
gone
,
I
wonder
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Straight
on
,
as
sure
as
God
made
little
apples
,
''
said
Jan.
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
;
we
are
better
mounted
,
and
must
overtake
em
''
,
said
Oak
.
*NL*
``
Now
on
at
full
speed
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
sound
of
the
rider
in
their
van
could
now
be
discovered
.
The
*NL*
road-metal
grew
softer
and
more
clayey
as
Weatherbury
was
left
*NL*
behind
,
and
the
late
rain
had
wetted
its
surface
to
a
somewhat
*NL*
plastic
,
but
not
muddy
state
.
They
came
to
cross-roads
.
Coggan
*NL*
suddenly
pulled
up
Moll
and
slipped
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
?
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
try
to
track
'em
,
since
we
ca
n't
hear
'em
,
''
said
Jan
,
*NL*
fumbling
in
his
pockets
.
He
struck
a
light
,
and
held
the
match
to
*NL*
the
ground
.
The
rain
had
been
heavier
here
,
and
all
foot
and
horse
*NL*
tracks
made
previous
to
the
storm
had
been
abraded
and
blurred
by
*NL*
the
drops
,
and
they
were
now
so
many
little
scoops
of
water
,
which
*NL*
reflected
the
flame
of
the
match
like
eyes
.
One
set
of
tracks
was
*NL*
fresh
and
had
no
water
in
them
;
one
pair
of
ruts
was
also
empty
,
*NL*
and
not
small
canals
,
like
the
others
.
The
footprints
forming
this
*NL*
recent
impression
were
full
of
information
as
to
pace
;
they
were
in
*NL*
equidistant
pairs
,
three
or
four
feet
apart
,
the
right
and
left
foot
*NL*
of
each
pair
being
exactly
opposite
one
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Straight
on
!
''
Jan
exclaimed
.
``
Tracks
like
that
mean
a
stiff
gallop
.
*NL*
No
wonder
we
do
n't
hear
him
.
And
the
horse
is
harnessed
--
look
at
the
*NL*
ruts
.
Ay
,
that
's
our
mare
sure
enough
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Jimmy
Harris
only
shoed
her
last
week
,
and
I
'd
swear
to
his
make
*NL*
among
ten
thousand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
rest
of
the
gipsies
must
ha
'
gone
on
earlier
,
or
some
other
*NL*
way
,
''
said
Oak
.
``
You
saw
there
were
no
other
tracks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
.
''
They
rode
along
silently
for
a
long
weary
time
.
Coggan
*NL*
carried
an
old
pinchbeck
repeater
which
he
had
inherited
from
some
*NL*
genius
in
his
family
;
and
it
now
struck
one
.
He
lighted
another
*NL*
match
,
and
examined
the
ground
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
canter
now
,
''
he
said
,
throwing
away
the
light
.
``
A
twisty
,
*NL*
rickety
pace
for
a
gig
.
The
fact
is
,
they
over-drove
her
at
*NL*
starting
;
we
shall
catch
'em
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
hastened
on
,
and
entered
Blackmore
Vale
.
Coggan
's
watch
*NL*
struck
one
.
When
they
looked
again
the
hoof-marks
were
so
spaced
as
*NL*
to
form
a
sort
of
zigzag
if
united
,
like
the
lamps
along
a
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
a
trot
,
I
know
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
trot
now
,
''
said
Coggan
,
cheerfully
.
``
We
shall
overtake
him
*NL*
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
pushed
rapidly
on
for
yet
two
or
three
miles
.
``
Ah
!
a
moment
,
''
*NL*
said
Jan.
.
``
Let
's
see
how
she
was
driven
up
this
hill
.
`
Twill
help
*NL*
us
.
''
A
light
was
promptly
struck
upon
his
gaiters
as
before
,
and
the
*NL*
examination
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
said
Coggan
.
``
She
walked
up
here
--
and
well
she
might
.
We
*NL*
shall
get
them
in
two
miles
,
for
a
crown
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rode
three
,
and
listened
.
No
sound
was
to
be
heard
save
a
*NL*
millpond
trickling
hoarsely
through
a
hatch
,
and
suggesting
gloomy
*NL*
possibilities
of
drowning
by
jumping
in
.
Gabriel
dismounted
when
*NL*
they
came
to
a
turning
.
The
tracks
were
absolutely
the
only
guide
as
*NL*
to
the
direction
that
they
now
had
,
and
great
caution
was
necessary
*NL*
to
avoid
confusing
them
with
some
others
which
had
made
their
*NL*
appearance
lately
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
does
this
mean
?
--
though
I
guess
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
looking
up
*NL*
at
Coggan
as
he
moved
the
match
over
the
ground
about
the
turning
.
*NL*
Coggan
,
who
,
no
less
than
the
panting
horses
,
had
latterly
shown
*NL*
signs
of
weariness
,
again
scrutinized
the
mystic
characters
.
This
*NL*
time
only
three
were
of
the
regular
horseshoe
shape
.
Every
fourth
*NL*
was
a
dot
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
screwed
up
his
face
and
emitted
a
long
``
Whew-w-w
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lame
,
''
said
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Dainty
is
lamed
;
the
near-foot-afore
,
''
said
Coggan
slowly
,
*NL*
staring
still
at
the
footprints
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
push
on
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
remounting
his
humid
steed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Although
the
road
along
its
greater
part
had
been
as
good
as
any
*NL*
turnpike-road
in
the
country
,
it
was
nominally
only
a
byway
.
The
*NL*
last
turning
had
brought
them
into
the
high
road
leading
to
Bath
.
*NL*
Coggan
recollected
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
have
him
now
!
''
he
exclaimed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sherton
Turnpike
.
The
keeper
of
that
gate
is
the
sleepiest
man
*NL*
between
here
and
London
--
Dan
Randall
,
that
's
his
name
--
knowed
en
for
*NL*
years
,
when
he
was
at
Casterbridge
gate
.
Between
the
lameness
and
the
*NL*
gate
't
is
a
done
job
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
now
advanced
with
extreme
caution
.
Nothing
was
said
until
,
*NL*
against
a
shady
background
of
foliage
,
five
white
bars
were
visible
,
*NL*
crossing
their
route
a
little
way
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hush
--
we
are
almost
close
!
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amble
on
upon
the
grass
,
''
said
Coggan
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
white
bars
were
blotted
out
in
the
midst
by
a
dark
shape
in
*NL*
front
of
them
.
The
silence
of
this
lonely
time
was
pierced
by
an
*NL*
exclamation
from
that
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hoy-a-hoy
!
Gate
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
appeared
that
there
had
been
a
previous
call
which
they
had
not
*NL*
noticed
,
for
on
their
close
approach
the
door
of
the
turnpike-house
*NL*
opened
,
and
the
keeper
came
out
half-dressed
,
with
a
candle
in
his
*NL*
hand
.
The
rays
illumined
the
whole
group
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
the
gate
close
!
''
shouted
Gabriel
.
``
He
has
stolen
the
horse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
''
said
the
turnpike-man
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
looked
at
the
driver
of
the
gig
,
and
saw
a
woman
--
Bathsheba
,
*NL*
his
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
hearing
his
voice
she
had
turned
her
face
away
from
the
light
.
*NL*
Coggan
had
,
however
,
caught
sight
of
her

the
meanwhile

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
't
is
mistress
--
I
'll
take
my
oath
!
''
he
said
,
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
it
certainly
was
,
and
she
had
by
this
time
done
the
trick
*NL*
she
could
do
so
well
in
crises
not
of
love
,
namely
,
mask
a
surprise
*NL*
by
coolness
of
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Gabriel
,
''
she
inquired
quietly
,
``
where
are
you
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
--
''
began
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
driving
to
Bath
,
''
she
said
,
taking
for
her
own
use
the
*NL*
assurance
that
Gabriel
lacked
.
``
An
important
matter
made
it
*NL*
necessary
for
me
to
give
up
my
visit
to
Liddy
,
and
go
off
at
once
.
*NL*
What
,
then
,
were
you
following
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
thought
the
horse
was
stole
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
what
a
thing
!
How
very
foolish
of
you
not
to
know
that
I
had
*NL*
taken
the
trap
and
horse
.
I
could
neither
wake
Maryann
nor
get
into
*NL*
the
house
,
though
I
hammered
for
ten
minutes
against
her
window-sill
.
*NL*
Fortunately
,
I
could
get
the
key
of
the
coach-house
,
so
I
troubled
no
*NL*
one
further
.
Did
n't
you
think
it
might
be
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
we
,
miss
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
not
.
Why
,
those
are
never
Farmer
Boldwood
's
horses
!
*NL*
Goodness
mercy
!
what
have
you
been
doing
--
bringing
trouble
upon
me
in
*NL*
this
way
?
What
!
must
n't
a
lady
move
an
inch
from
her
door
without
*NL*
being
dogged
like
a
thief
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
how
was
we
to
know
,
if
you
left
no
account
of
your
doings
?
''
*NL*
expostulated
Coggan
,
``
and
ladies
do
n't
drive
at
these
hours
,
miss
,
*NL*
as
a
jineral
rule
of
society
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
leave
an
account
--
and
you
would
have
seen
it
in
the
morning
.
*NL*
I
wrote
in
chalk
on
the
coach-house
doors
that
I
had
come
back
for
*NL*
the
horse
and
gig
,
and
driven
off
;
that
I
could
arouse
nobody
,
and
*NL*
should
return
soon

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
consider
,
ma'am

that
we
could
n't
see
that
till
it
got
*NL*
daylight

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
''
she
said
,
and
though
vexed
at
first
she
had
too
much
sense
*NL*
to
blame
them
long
or
seriously
for
a
devotion
to
her
that
was
as
*NL*
valuable
as
it
was
rare
.
She
added
with
a
very
pretty
grace
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
I
really
thank
you
heartily
for
taking
all
this
trouble
;
but
I
wish
*NL*
you
had
borrowed
anybody
's
horses
but
Mr.
Boldwood

*NL*
*NL*
``
Dainty
is
lame

said
Coggan
.
``
Can
ye
go
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
only
a
stone
in
her
shoe
.
I
got
down
and
pulled
it
out
a
*NL*
hundred
yards
back
.
I
can
manage
very
well
,
thank
you
.
I
shall
be
*NL*
in
Bath
by
daylight
.
Will
you
now
return
,
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
her
head
--
the
gateman
's
candle
shimmering
upon
her
quick
,
*NL*
clear
eyes
as
she
did
so
--
passed
through
the
gate
,
and
was
soon
*NL*
wrapped
in
the
embowering
shades
of
mysterious
summer
boughs
.
Coggan
*NL*
and
Gabriel
put
about
their
horses
,
and
,
fanned
by
the
velvety
air
of
*NL*
this
July
night
,
retraced
the
road
by
which
they
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
strange
vagary
,
this
of
hers
,
is
n't
it
,
Oak
?
''
said
Coggan
,
*NL*
curiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
shortly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
wo
n't
be
in
Bath
by
no
daylight

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coggan
,
suppose
we
keep
this
night
's
work
as
quiet
as
we
can
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
of
one
and
the
same
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
We
shall
be
home
by
three
o'clock
or
so
,
and
can
creep
*NL*
into
the
parish
like
lambs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
perturbed
meditations
by
the
roadside
had
ultimately
*NL*
evolved
a
conclusion
that
there
were
only
two
remedies
for
the
*NL*
present
desperate
state
of
affairs
.
The
first
was
merely
to
*NL*
keep
Troy
away
from
Weatherbury
till
Boldwood
's
indignation
had
*NL*
cooled
;
the
second
to
listen
to
Oak
's
entreaties
,
and
Boldwood
's
*NL*
denunciations
,
and
give
up
Troy
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
Could
she
give
up
this
new
love
--
induce
him
to
renounce
her
*NL*
by
saying
she
did
not
like
him
--
could
no
more
speak
to
him
,
and
beg
*NL*
him
,
for
her
good
,
to
end
his
furlough
in
Bath
,
and
see
her
and
*NL*
Weatherbury
no
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
picture
full
of
misery
,
but
for
a
while
she
contemplated
it
*NL*
firmly
,
allowing
herself
,
nevertheless
,
as
girls
will
,
to
dwell
upon
*NL*
the
happy
life
she
would
have
enjoyed
had
Troy
been
Boldwood
,
and
the
*NL*
path
of
love
the
path
of
duty
--
inflicting
upon
herself
gratuitous
*NL*
tortures
by
imagining
him
the
lover
of
another
woman
after
forgetting
*NL*
her
;
for
she
had
penetrated
Troy
's
nature
so
far
as
to
estimate
his
*NL*
tendencies
pretty
accurately
,
but
unfortunately
loved
him
no
less
in
*NL*
thinking
that
he
might
soon
cease
to
love
her
--
indeed
,
considerably
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
jumped
to
her
feet
.
She
would
see
him
at
once
.
Yes
,
she
would
*NL*
implore
him
by
word
of
mouth
to
assist
her
in
this
dilemma
.
A
letter
*NL*
to
keep
him
away
could
not
reach
him
in
time
,
even
if
he
should
be
*NL*
disposed
to
listen
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
Bathsheba
altogether
blind
to
the
obvious
fact
that
the
support
*NL*
of
a
lover
's
arms
is
not
of
a
kind
best
calculated
to
assist
a
*NL*
resolve
to
renounce
him
?
Or
was
she
sophistically
sensible
,
with
a
*NL*
thrill
of
pleasure
,
that
by
adopting
this
course
for
getting
rid
of
*NL*
him
she
was
ensuring
a
meeting
with
him
,
at
any
rate
,
once
more
?
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
dark
,
and
the
hour
must
have
been
nearly
ten
.
The
only
*NL*
way
to
accomplish
her
purpose
was
to
give
up
her
idea
of
visiting
*NL*
Liddy
at
Yalbury
,
return
to
Weatherbury
Farm
,
put
the
horse
into
*NL*
the
gig
,
and
drive
at
once
to
Bath
.
The
scheme
seemed
at
first
*NL*
impossible
:
the
journey
was
a
fearfully
heavy
one
,
even
for
a
strong
*NL*
horse
,
at
her
own
estimate
;
and
she
much
underrated
the
distance
.
*NL*
It
was
most
venturesome
for
a
woman
,
at
night
,
and
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
could
she
go
on
to
Liddy
's
and
leave
things
to
take
their
course
?
*NL*
No
,
no
;
anything
but
that
.
Bathsheba
was
full
of
a
stimulating
*NL*
turbulence
,
beside
which
caution
vainly
prayed
for
a
hearing
.
She
*NL*
turned
back
towards
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
walk
was
slow
,
for
she
wished
not
to
enter
Weatherbury
till
the
*NL*
cottagers
were
in
bed
,
and
,
particularly
,
till
Boldwood
was
secure
.
*NL*
Her
plan
was
now
to
drive
to
Bath
during
the
night
,
see
Sergeant
Troy
*NL*
in
the
morning
before
he
set
out
to
come
to
her
,
bid
him
farewell
,
*NL*
and
dismiss
him
:
then
to
rest
the
horse
thoroughly
-LRB-
herself
to
weep
*NL*
the
while
,
she
thought
-RRB-
,
starting
early
the
next
morning
on
her
*NL*
return
journey
.
By
this
arrangement
she
could
trot
Dainty
gently
*NL*
all
the
day
,
reach
Liddy
at
Yalbury
in
the
evening
,
and
come
home
to
*NL*
Weatherbury
with
her
whenever
they
chose
--
so
nobody
would
know
she
*NL*
had
been
to
Bath
at
all
.
Such
was
Bathsheba
's
scheme
.
But
in
her
*NL*
topographical
ignorance
as
a
late
comer
to
the
place
,
she
misreckoned
*NL*
the
distance
of
her
journey
as
not
much
more
than
half
what
it
really
*NL*
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
idea
she
proceeded
to
carry
out
,
with
what
initial
success
we
*NL*
have
already
seen
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
SUN
--
A
HARBINGER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
passed
,
and
there
were
no
tidings
of
Bathsheba
;
nor
was
there
*NL*
any
explanation
of
her
Gilpin
's
rig
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
note
came
for
Maryann
,
stating
that
the
business
which
had
*NL*
called
her
mistress
to
Bath
still
detained
her
there
;
but
that
she
*NL*
hoped
to
return
in
the
course
of
another
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
week
passed
.
The
oat-harvest
began
,
and
all
the
men
were
*NL*
a-field
under
a
monochromatic
Lammas
sky
,
amid
the
trembling
air
*NL*
and
short
shadows
of
noon
.
Indoors
nothing
was
to
be
heard
save
*NL*
the
droning
of
blue-bottle
flies
;
out-of-doors
the
whetting
of
*NL*
scythes
and
the
hiss
of
tressy
oat-ears
rubbing
together
as
their
*NL*
perpendicular
stalks
of
amber-yellow
fell
heavily
to
each
swath
.
*NL*
Every
drop
of
moisture
not
in
the
men
's
bottles
and
flagons
in
the
*NL*
form
of
cider
was
raining
as
perspiration
from
their
foreheads
and
*NL*
cheeks
.
Drought
was
everywhere
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
about
to
withdraw
for
a
while
into
the
charitable
shade
*NL*
of
a
tree
in
the
fence
,
when
Coggan
saw
a
figure
in
a
blue
coat
and
*NL*
brass
buttons
running
to
them
across
the
field
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
who
that
is
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
nothing
is
wrong
about
mistress
,
''
said
Maryann
,
who
with
some
*NL*
other
women
was
tying
the
bundles
-LRB-
oats
being
always
sheafed
on
this
*NL*
farm
-RRB-
,
``
but
an
unlucky
token
came
to
me
indoors
this
morning
.
I
*NL*
went
to
unlock
the
door
and
dropped
the
key
,
and
it
fell
upon
the
*NL*
stone
floor
and
broke
into
two
pieces
.
Breaking
a
key
is
a
dreadful
*NL*
bodement
.
I
wish
mis
`
ess
was
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
Cain
Ball
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
pausing
from
whetting
his
reaphook
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
was
not
bound
by
his
agreement
to
assist
in
the
corn-field
;
but
*NL*
the
harvest
month
is
an
anxious
time
for
a
farmer
,
and
the
corn
was
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
,
so
he
lent
a
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
dressed
up
in
his
best
clothes
,
''
said
Matthew
Moon
.
``
He
hev
*NL*
been
away
from
home
for
a
few
days
,
since
he
's
had
that
felon
upon
*NL*
his
finger
;
for
'
a
said
,
since
I
ca
n't
work
I
'll
have
a
hollerday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
good
time
for
one
--
a
'
excellent
time
,
''
said
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
*NL*
straightening
his
back
;
for
he
,
like
some
of
the
others
,
had
a
way
*NL*
of
resting
a
while
from
his
labour
on
such
hot
days
for
reasons
*NL*
preternaturally
small
;
of
which
Cain
Ball
's
advent
on
a
week-day
in
*NL*
his
Sunday-clothes
was
one
of
the
first
magnitude
.
``
Twas
a
bad
leg
*NL*
allowed
me
to
read
the
_
Pilgrim
's
Progress
_
,
and
Mark
Clark
learnt
*NL*
All-Fours
in
a
whitlow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
and
my
father
put
his
arm
out
of
joint
to
have
time
to
go
*NL*
courting
,
''
said
Jan
Coggan
,
in
an
eclipsing
tone
,
wiping
his
face
*NL*
with
his
shirt-sleeve
and
thrusting
back
his
hat
upon
the
nape
of
*NL*
his
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
Cainy
was
nearing
the
group
of
harvesters
,
and
was
*NL*
perceived
to
be
carrying
a
large
slice
of
bread
and
ham
in
one
hand
,
*NL*
from
which
he
took
mouthfuls
as
he
ran
,
the
other
being
wrapped
in
a
*NL*
bandage
.
When
he
came
close
,
his
mouth
assumed
the
bell
shape
,
and
*NL*
he
began
to
cough
violently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Cainy
!
''
said
Gabriel
,
sternly
.
``
How
many
more
times
must
I
*NL*
tell
you
to
keep
from
running
so
fast
when
you
be
eating
?
You
'll
*NL*
choke
yourself
some
day
,
that
's
what
you
'll
do

Cain
Ball
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hok-hok-hok
!
''
replied
Cain
.
``
A
crumb
of
my
victuals
went
the
*NL*
wrong
way
--
hok-hok

That
's
what
't
is

Mister
Oak

And
I
've
been

visiting

because
I

a

on
my

yes

and
I
've
*NL*
seen

''
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
Cain
mentioned
Bath
,
they
all
threw
down
their
hooks
and
*NL*
forks
and
drew
round
him
.
Unfortunately
the
erratic
crumb
did
not
*NL*
improve
his
narrative
powers
,
and
a
supplementary
hindrance
was
that
*NL*
of
a
sneeze
,
jerking
from
his
pocket
his
rather
large
watch
,
which
*NL*
dangled
in
front
of
the
young
man
pendulum-wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
continued
,
directing
his
thoughts
to
Bath
and
letting
his
*NL*
eyes
follow
,
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bother

said
Gabriel
.
``
Something

*NL*
*NL*
``

Losing
the
thread
of
his

narrative
at
this
point
simultaneously
with
his
loss
of
breath
,
their
*NL*
informant
looked
up
and
down
the
field
apparently
for
some
clue
to

it

looking
reproachfully
at

Coggan

lifting
a
flagon
of

pulling
out
the

applying
*NL*
the
hole
to
Cainy
's
mouth
;
Joseph
Poorgrass
in

beginning

to
think
apprehensively
of
the
serious
consequences
that
would
follow
*NL*
Cainy
Ball
's
strangulation
in
his
cough

the
history

dying
with

Mr.

poured
the
liquor
with
unstinted
liberality
at
the

suffering
Cain

circular
mouth
;
half
of
it
running
down
the
side
of

the
flagon

half
of
what
reached
his

running
down
outside

his

half
of
what
ran
in
going
the
wrong

and
being
*NL*
coughed
and
sneezed
around
the
persons
of
the
gathered
reapers
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
cider
fog

for

hung
in

``

returning
to
the
group

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay

she

trimmed

black
lace

stood
alone

inside

required

'T
was
a
very
winsome
sight

her
hair
was
brushed

splendid

And
when
the
sun
shone
upon
the
bright
gown

his
red

my
!
how

not

whilst

*NL*
all
the
work-folk
here
assembled
,
can
you
swear
to
your
words
as
the
*NL*
shepherd
asks
ye
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
no
,
Mister
Oak
!
''
said
Cainy
,
looking
from
one
to
the
other
*NL*
with
great
uneasiness
at
the
spiritual
magnitude
of
the
position
.
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
mind
saying
't
is
true
,
but
I
do
n't
like
to
say
't
is
damn
true
,
*NL*
if
that
's
what
you
mane
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cain
,
Cain
,
how
can
you
!
''
asked
Joseph
sternly
.
``
You
be
asked
to
*NL*
swear
in
a
holy
manner
,
and
you
swear
like
wicked
Shimei
,
the
son
of
*NL*
Gera
,
who
cursed
as
he
came
.
Young
man
,
fie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
!
'T
is
you
want
to
squander
a
pore
boy
's
soul
,
Joseph
*NL*
Poorgrass
--
that
's
what
't
is
!
''
said
Cain
,
beginning
to
cry
.
``
All
I
*NL*
mane
is
that
in
common
truth
't
was
Miss
Everdene
and
Sergeant
Troy
,
*NL*
but
in
the
horrible
so-help-me
truth
that
ye
want
to
make
of
it
*NL*
perhaps
't
was
somebody
else
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
no
getting
at
the
rights
of
it
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
turning
to
*NL*
his
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cain
Ball
,
you
'll
come
to
a
bit
of
bread
!
''
groaned
Joseph
Poorgrass
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
reapers
'
hooks
were
flourished
again
,
and
the
old
sounds
*NL*
went
on
.
Gabriel
,
without
making
any
pretence
of
being
lively
,
did
*NL*
nothing
to
show
that
he
was
particularly
dull
.
However
,
Coggan
knew
*NL*
pretty
nearly
how
the
land
lay
,
and
when
they
were
in
a
nook
together
*NL*
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
on
about
her
,
Gabriel
.
What
difference
does
it
make
*NL*
whose
sweetheart
she
is
,
since
she
ca
n't
be
yours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
very
thing
I
say
to
myself
,

said
Gabriel
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
HOME
AGAIN
--
A
TRICKSTER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
same
evening
at
dusk
Gabriel
was
leaning
over
Coggan
's
*NL*
garden-gate
,
taking
an
up-and-down
survey
before
retiring
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
vehicle
of
some
kind
was
softly
creeping
along
the
grassy
margin
of
*NL*
the
lane
.
From
it
spread
the
tones
of
two
women
talking
.
The
tones
*NL*
were
natural
and
not
at
all
suppressed
.
Oak
instantly
knew
the
voices
*NL*
to
be
those
of
Bathsheba
and
Liddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
came
opposite
and
passed
by
.
It
was
Miss
Everdene
's
*NL*
gig
,
and
Liddy
and
her
mistress
were
the
only
occupants
of
the
seat
.
*NL*
Liddy
was
asking
questions
about
the
city
of
Bath
,
and
her
companion
*NL*
was
answering
them
listlessly
and
unconcernedly
.
Both
Bathsheba
and
*NL*
the
horse
seemed
weary
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
exquisite
relief
of
finding
that
she
was
here
again
,
safe
and
*NL*
sound
,
overpowered
all
reflection
,
and
Oak
could
only
luxuriate
in
*NL*
the
sense
of
it
.
All
grave
reports
were
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
lingered
and
lingered
on
,
till
there
was
no
difference
between
the
*NL*
eastern
and
western
expanses
of
sky
,
and
the
timid
hares
began
to
*NL*
limp
courageously
round
the
dim
hillocks
.
Gabriel
might
have
been
*NL*
there
an
additional
half-hour
when
a
dark
form
walked
slowly
by
.
*NL*
``
Good-night
,
Gabriel
,
''
the
passer
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Boldwood
.
``
Good-night
,
sir
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
likewise
vanished
up
the
road
,
and
Oak
shortly
afterwards
*NL*
turned
indoors
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Farmer
Boldwood
went
on
towards
Miss
Everdene
's
house
.
He
reached
*NL*
the
front
,
and
approaching
the
entrance
,
saw
a
light
in
the
parlour
.
*NL*
The
blind
was
not
drawn
down
,
and
inside
the
room
was
Bathsheba
,
*NL*
looking
over
some
papers
or
letters
.
Her
back
was
towards
Boldwood
.
*NL*
He
went
to
the
door
,
knocked
,
and
waited
with
tense
muscles
and
an
*NL*
aching
brow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
had
not
been
outside
his
garden
since
his
meeting
with
*NL*
Bathsheba
in
the
road
to
Yalbury
.
Silent
and
alone
,
he
had
remained
*NL*
in
moody
meditation
on
woman
's
ways
,
deeming
as
essentials
of
the
*NL*
whole
sex
the
accidents
of
the
single
one
of
their
number
he
had
ever
*NL*
closely
beheld
.
By
degrees
a
more
charitable
temper
had
pervaded
*NL*
him
,
and
this
was
the
reason
of
his
sally
to-night
.
He
had
come
to
*NL*
apologize
and
beg
forgiveness
of
Bathsheba
with
something
like
a
*NL*
sense
of
shame
at
his
violence
,
having
but
just
now
learnt
that
she
*NL*
had
returned
--
only
from
a
visit
to
Liddy
,
as
he
supposed
,
the
Bath
*NL*
escapade
being
quite
unknown
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
inquired
for
Miss
Everdene
.
Liddy
's
manner
was
odd
,
but
he
did
*NL*
not
notice
it
.
She
went
in
,
leaving
him
standing
there
,
and
in
her
*NL*
absence
the
blind
of
the
room
containing
Bathsheba
was
pulled
down
.
*NL*
Boldwood
augured
ill
from
that
sign
.
Liddy
came
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
can
not
see
you
,
sir
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmer
instantly
went
out
by
the
gate
.
He
was
unforgiven
--
that
*NL*
was
the
issue
of
it
all
.
He
had
seen
her
who
was
to
him
*NL*
simultaneously
a
delight
and
a
torture
,
sitting
in
the
room
he
had
*NL*
shared
with
her
as
a
peculiarly
privileged
guest
only
a
little
*NL*
earlier
in
the
summer
,
and
she
had
denied
him
an
entrance
there
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
did
not
hurry
homeward
.
It
was
ten
o'clock
at
least
,
when
,
*NL*
walking
deliberately
through
the
lower
part
of
Weatherbury
,
he
heard
*NL*
the
carrier
's
spring
van
entering
the
village
.
The
van
ran
to
and
*NL*
from
a
town
in
a
northern
direction
,
and
it
was
owned
and
driven
by
*NL*
a
Weatherbury
man
,
at
the
door
of
whose
house
it
now
pulled
up
.
The
*NL*
lamp
fixed
to
the
head
of
the
hood
illuminated
a
scarlet
and
gilded
*NL*
form
,
who
was
the
first
to
alight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Boldwood
to
himself
,
``
come
to
see
her
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
entered
the
carrier
's
house
,
which
had
been
the
place
of
his
*NL*
lodging
on
his
last
visit
to
his
native
place
.
Boldwood
was
moved
*NL*
by
a
sudden
determination
.
He
hastened
home
.
In
ten
minutes
he
was
*NL*
back
again
,
and
made
as
if
he
were
going
to
call
upon
Troy
at
the
*NL*
carrier
's
.
But
as
he
approached
,
some
one
opened
the
door
and
came
*NL*
out
.
He
heard
this
person
say
``
Good-night
''
to
the
inmates
,
and
the
*NL*
voice
was
Troy
's
.
This
was
strange
,
coming
so
immediately
after
*NL*
his
arrival
.
Boldwood
,
however
,
hastened
up
to
him
.
Troy
had
what
*NL*
appeared
to
be
a
carpet-bag
in
his
hand
--
the
same
that
he
had
brought
*NL*
with
him
.
It
seemed
as
if
he
were
going
to
leave
again
this
very
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
turned
up
the
hill
and
quickened
his
pace
.
Boldwood
stepped
*NL*
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sergeant
Troy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
'm
Sergeant
Troy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
arrived
from
up
the
country
,
I
think
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
arrived
from
Bath
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
William
Boldwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tone
in
which
this
word
was
uttered
was
all
that
had
been
wanted
*NL*
to
bring
Boldwood
to
the
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
to
speak
a
word
with
you
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
About
her
who
lives
just
ahead
there
--
and
about
a
woman
you
have
*NL*
wronged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
at
your
impertinence
,
''
said
Troy
,
moving
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
here
,
''
said
Boldwood
,
standing
in
front
of
him
,
``
wonder
or
*NL*
not
,
you
are
going
to
hold
a
conversation
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
heard
the
dull
determination
in
Boldwood
's
voice
,
looked
at
his
*NL*
stalwart
frame
,
then
at
the
thick
cudgel
he
carried
in
his
hand
.
He
*NL*
remembered
it
was
past
ten
o'clock
.
It
seemed
worth
while
to
be
civil
*NL*
to
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
I
'll
listen
with
pleasure
,
''
said
Troy
,
placing
his
bag
on
*NL*
the
ground
,
``
only
speak
low
,
for
somebody
or
other
may
overhear
us
in
*NL*
the
farmhouse
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
then
--
I
know
a
good
deal
concerning
your
Fanny
Robin
's
*NL*
attachment
to
you
.
I
may
say
,
too
,
that
I
believe
I
am
the
only
*NL*
person
in
the
village
,
excepting
Gabriel
Oak
,
who
does
know
it
.
You
*NL*
ought
to
marry
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
ought
.
Indeed
,
I
wish
to
,
but
I
can
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
was
about
to
utter
something
hastily
;
he
then
checked
himself
*NL*
and
said
,
``
I
am
too
poor
.
''
His
voice
was
changed
.
Previously
it
had
*NL*
had
a
devil-may-care
tone
.
It
was
the
voice
of
a
trickster
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
's
present
mood
was
not
critical
enough
to
notice
tones
.
He
*NL*
continued
,
``
I
may
as
well
speak
plainly
;
and
understand
,
I
do
n't
*NL*
wish
to
enter
into
the
questions
of
right
or
wrong
,
woman
's
honour
*NL*
and
shame
,
or
to
express
any
opinion
on
your
conduct
.
I
intend
a
*NL*
business
transaction
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
,
''
said
Troy
.
``
Suppose
we
sit
down
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
tree
trunk
lay
under
the
hedge
immediately
opposite
,
and
they
*NL*
sat
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
Miss
Everdene
,
''
said
Boldwood
,
``
but
*NL*
you
came
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
engaged
,
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
good
as
engaged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
not
turned
up
she
might
have
become
engaged
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hang
might
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
had
not
come
I
should
certainly
--
yes
,
CERTAINLY
--
have
been
*NL*
accepted
by
this
time
.
If
you
had
not
seen
her
you
might
have
been
*NL*
married
to
Fanny
.
Well
,
there
's
too
much
difference
between
Miss
*NL*
Everdene
's
station
and
your
own
for
this
flirtation
with
her
ever
to
*NL*
benefit
you
by
ending
in
marriage
.
So
all
I
ask
is
,
do
n't
molest
her
*NL*
any
more
.
Marry
Fanny
.
I
'll
make
it
worth
your
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
will
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pay
you
well
now
,
I
'll
settle
a
sum
of
money
upon
her
,
and
*NL*
I
'll
see
that
you
do
n't
suffer
from
poverty
in
the
future
.
I
'll
put
*NL*
it
clearly
.
Bathsheba
is
only
playing
with
you
:
you
are
too
poor
*NL*
for
her
as
I
said
;
so
give
up
wasting
your
time
about
a
great
match
*NL*
you
'll
never
make
for
a
moderate
and
rightful
match
you
may
make
*NL*
to-morrow
;
take
up
your
carpet-bag
,
turn
about
,
leave
Weatherbury
*NL*
now
,
this
night
,
and
you
shall
take
fifty
pounds
with
you
.
Fanny
*NL*
shall
have
fifty
to
enable
her
to
prepare
for
the
wedding
,
when
you
*NL*
have
told
me
where
she
is
living
,
and
she
shall
have
five
hundred
*NL*
paid
down
on
her
wedding-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
making
this
statement
Boldwood
's
voice
revealed
only
too
clearly
*NL*
a
consciousness
of
the
weakness
of
his
position
,
his
aims
,
and
his
*NL*
method
.
His
manner
had
lapsed
quite
from
that
of
the
firm
and
*NL*
dignified
Boldwood
of
former
times
;
and
such
a
scheme
as
he
had
now
*NL*
engaged
in
he
would
have
condemned
as
childishly
imbecile
only
a
few
*NL*
months
ago
.
We
discern
a
grand
force
in
the
lover
which
he
lacks
*NL*
whilst
a
free
man
;
but
there
is
a
breadth
of
vision
in
the
free
*NL*
man
which
in
the
lover
we
vainly
seek
.
Where
there
is
much
bias
*NL*
there
must
be
some
narrowness
,
and
love
,
though
added
emotion
,
is
*NL*
subtracted
capacity
.
Boldwood
exemplified
this
to
an
abnormal
*NL*
degree
:
he
knew
nothing
of
Fanny
Robin
's
circumstances
or
*NL*
whereabouts
,
he
knew
nothing
of
Troy
's
possibilities
,
yet
that
was
*NL*
what
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
Fanny
best
,
''
said
Troy
;
``
and
if
,
as
you
say
,
Miss
Everdene
is
*NL*
out
of
my
reach
,
why
I
have
all
to
gain
by
accepting
your
money
,
and
*NL*
marrying
Fan
.
But
she
's
only
a
servant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
mind
--
do
you
agree
to
my
arrangement
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
''
said
Boldwood
,
in
a
more
elastic
voice
.
``
Oh
,
Troy
,
if
you
like
*NL*
her
best
,
why
then
did
you
step
in
here
and
injure
my
happiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
Fanny
best
now
,
''
said
Troy
.
``
But
Bathsh
--
Miss
Everdene
*NL*
inflamed
me
,
and
displaced
Fanny
for
a
time
.
It
is
over
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
it
be
over
so
soon

And
why
then
did
you
come
here
*NL*
again
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
are
weighty
reasons

Fifty
pounds
at
once

you
said
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
said
Boldwood
,
``
and
here
they
are
--
fifty
sovereigns
.
''
He
*NL*
handed
Troy
a
small
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
everything
ready
--
it
seems
that
you
calculated
on
my
*NL*
accepting
them
,
''
said
the
sergeant
,
taking
the
packet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
might
accept
them
,
''
said
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
only
my
word
that
the
programme
shall
be
adhered
to
,
whilst
*NL*
I
at
any
rate
have
fifty
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
thought
of
that
,
and
I
have
considered
that
if
I
ca
n't
appeal
*NL*
to
your
honour
I
can
trust
to
your
--
well
,
shrewdness
we
'll
call
*NL*
it
--
not
to
lose
five
hundred
pounds
in
prospect
,
and
also
make
a
*NL*
bitter
enemy
of
a
man
who
is
willing
to
be
an
extremely
useful
*NL*
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
,
listen
!
''
said
Troy
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
pit-pat
was
audible
upon
the
road
just
above
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
George
--
't
is
she

he
continued
.
``
I
must
go
on
and
meet
her

*NL*
*NL*
``
She

who
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bathsheba

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bathsheba

out
alone
at

said
Boldwood
in
*NL*
amazement
,
and
starting
up
.
``
Why
must
you
meet
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
expecting
me
to-night

and
I
must
now
speak
to
her

wish
*NL*
her
good-bye
,
according
to
your
wish

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
the
necessity

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
do
no

she
'll
be
wandering
about
looking

You
shall
hear
all
I
say
to
her

It
will
help
you
in
your
*NL*
love-making
when
I
am
gone

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
tone
is
mocking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

And
remember
this

if
she
does
not
know
what
has
become

think
more
about

tell

flatly

come

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
confine

*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
The
light
footstep
came
closer
,
halting
occasionally
,
as
if
the
*NL*
walker
listened
for
a
sound
.
Troy
whistled
a
double
note
in
a
soft
,
*NL*
fluty
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
to
that
,
is
it
!
''
murmured
Boldwood
,
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
promised
silence
,
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
promise
again

''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
stepped
forward
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Frank
,
dearest
,
is
that
you
?
''
The
tones
were
Bathsheba
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
God
!
''
said
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Troy
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
late
you
are
,
''
she
continued
,
tenderly
.
``
Did
you
come
by
the
*NL*
carrier
?
I
listened
and
heard
his
wheels
entering
the
village
,
but
*NL*
it
was
some
time
ago
,
and
I
had
almost
given
you
up
,
Frank

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
to
come
,
''
said
Frank
.
``
You
knew
I
should

did
you
not

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
thought
you
would
,
''
she
said
,
playfully
;
``
and
,
Frank
,
it
*NL*
is
so
lucky
!
There
's
not
a
soul
in
my
house

me
to-night

I
've
*NL*
packed
them
all
off
so
nobody
on
earth
will
know
of
your
visit
to
*NL*
your
lady
's
bower
.
Liddy
wanted
to
go
to
her
grandfather
's
to
tell
*NL*
him
about
her
holiday
,
and
I
said
she
might
stay
with
them
till
*NL*
to-morrow
--
when
you
'll
be
gone
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Capital
,
''
said
Troy
.
``
But
,
dear
me
,
I
had
better
go
back
for
my
*NL*
bag
,
because
my
slippers
and
brush
and
comb
are
in
it
;
you
run
home
*NL*
whilst
I
fetch
it
,
and
I
'll
promise
to
be
in
your
parlour
in
ten
*NL*
minutes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
She
turned
and
tripped
up
the
hill
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
progress
of
this
dialogue
there
was
a
nervous
twitching
*NL*
of
Boldwood
's
tightly
closed
lips
,
and
his
face
became
bathed
in
a
*NL*
clammy
dew
.
He
now
started
forward
towards
Troy
.
Troy
turned
to
*NL*
him
and
took
up
the
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
tell
her
I
have
come
to
give
her
up
and
can
not
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
said
the
soldier
,
mockingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
;
wait
a
minute
.
I
want
to
say
more
to
you
--
more
to
you
!
''
*NL*
said
Boldwood
,
in
a
hoarse
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Troy
,
``
you
see
my
dilemma
.
Perhaps
I
am
a
bad
man
--
the
*NL*
victim
of
my
impulses
--
led
away
to
do
what
I
ought
to
leave
undone
.
*NL*
I
ca
n't
,
however
,
marry
them
both
.
And
I
have
two
reasons
for
*NL*
choosing
Fanny
.
First
,
I
like
her
best
upon
the
whole
,
and
second
,
*NL*
you
make
it
worth
my
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
same
instant
Boldwood
sprang
upon
him
,
and
held
him
by
the
*NL*
neck
.
Troy
felt
Boldwood
's
grasp
slowly
tightening
.
The
move
was
*NL*
absolutely
unexpected
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
moment
,
''
he
gasped
.
``
You
are
injuring
her
you
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
mean
?
''
said
the
farmer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
breath
,
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
loosened
his
hand
,
saying
,
``
By
Heaven
,
I
've
a
mind
to
kill
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
ruin
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Save
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
can
she
be
saved
now
,
unless
I
marry
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
groaned
.
He
reluctantly
released
the
soldier
,
and
flung
him
*NL*
back
against
the
hedge
.
``
Devil
,
you
torture
me
!
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
rebounded
like
a
ball
,
and
was
about
to
make
a
dash
at
the
*NL*
farmer
;
but
he
checked
himself
,
saying
lightly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
worth
while
to
measure
my
strength
with
you
.
Indeed
it
*NL*
is
a
barbarous
way
of
settling
a
quarrel
.
I
shall
shortly
leave
the
*NL*
army
because
of
the
same
conviction
.
Now
after
that
revelation
of
*NL*
how
the
land
lies
with
Bathsheba
,
`
twould
be
a
mistake
to
kill
me
,
*NL*
would
it
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twould
be
a
mistake
to
kill
you

''
repeated
Boldwood
,
mechanically
,
*NL*
with
a
bowed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Better
kill
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Far
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
glad
you

it

*NL*
*NL*
``

alternative
is
dreadful

take
Bathsheba

I
give

up

*NL*
She
must
love

indeed

sell
soul

But

*NL*
*NL*

Bathsheba

continued
Boldwood

in
nervous

anxiety

Troy

she
will
make
a
good

indeed

she
is

worth
your
hastening
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
she
has
a
will

not

a
temper

I
shall
be
a
mere
slave

her

I
could
do
anything
with
poor
Fanny
Robin

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Boldwood

imploringly
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
's
arm
moved
spasmodically
towards
Troy
's
person
again
.
He
*NL*
repressed
the
instinct
,
and
his
form
drooped
as
with
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
soon
purchase
my
discharge

then

*NL*
*NL*
``

it

*NL*
``
How

No

it
down
to
you
on

wedding-day

''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
paused
in
secret
amazement
at
Boldwood
's
wild
infatuation

He
*NL*
carelessly
said
,
``
And

to
have
anything

*NL*
``
Yes

all
I

yours

''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
,
more
like
a
somnambulist
than
a
wakeful
man
,
pulled
out
the
*NL*
large
canvas
bag
he
carried
by
way
of
a
purse
,
and
searched
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
twenty-one
pounds
more
with

''
he
said
.
``
Two
notes

sovereign

before

leave
you
I
must
have
a
paper
signed

*NL*
*NL*

Nothing

Boldwood

hastily

They
went
up
the
hill
to
Bathsheba
's
house
.
When
they
stood
at
the
*NL*
entrance
,
Troy
said
,
``
Wait
here
a

Opening
the
door
,
he
*NL*
glided
inside
,
leaving
the
door
ajar

*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
waited
.
In
two
minutes
a
light
appeared
in
the
passage
.
*NL*
Boldwood
then
saw
that
the
chain
had
been
fastened
across
the
door
.
*NL*
Troy
appeared
inside
,
carrying
a
bedroom
candlestick
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

did
you

in

*NL*
contemptuously

*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Troy
handed
a
folded
newspaper
through
the
slit
between
door
and

doorpost
,
and
put
the
candle
close

``

he
said
,
*NL*
placing
his
finger
on
a
line

Boldwood
looked
and
read

A
low
gurgle
of
derisive
laughter
followed
the
words

The
paper
fell
from
Boldwood

hands

Troy
continued

*NL*
``
I
will

I
will
not

said
Boldwood
,
in
a
hiss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
I
wo
n't
have
it
,
''
said
Troy
,
contemptuously
.
He
wrapped
the
*NL*
packet
of
gold
in
the
notes
,
and
threw
the
whole
into
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
shook
his
clenched
fist
at
him
.
``
You
juggler
of
Satan
!
You
*NL*
black
hound

But
I
'll
punish
you
yet
;
mark
me
,
I
'll
punish
you
yet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
peal
of
laughter
.
Troy
then
closed
the
door
,
and
locked
*NL*
himself
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
the
whole
of
that
night
Boldwood
's
dark
form
might
have
*NL*
been
seen
walking
about
the
hills
and
downs
of
Weatherbury
like
an
*NL*
unhappy
Shade
in
the
Mournful
Fields
by
Acheron

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AT
AN
UPPER
WINDOW
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
early
the
next
morning
--
a
time
of
sun
and
dew
.
The
*NL*
confused
beginnings
of
many
birds
'
songs
spread
into
the
healthy
air
,
*NL*
and
the
wan
blue
of
the
heaven
was
here
and
there
coated
with
thin
*NL*
webs
of
incorporeal
cloud
which
were
of
no
effect
in
obscuring
day
.
*NL*
All
the
lights
in
the
scene
were
yellow
as
to
colour
,
and
all
the
*NL*
shadows
were
attenuated
as
to
form
.
The
creeping
plants
about
the
*NL*
old
manor-house
were
bowed
with
rows
of
heavy
water
drops
,
which
*NL*
had
upon
objects
behind
them
the
effect
of
minute
lenses
of
high
*NL*
magnifying
power
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
before
the
clock
struck
five
Gabriel
Oak
and
Coggan
passed
the
*NL*
village
cross
,
and
went
on
together
to
the
fields
.
They
were
yet
*NL*
barely
in
view
of
their
mistress
's
house
,
when
Oak
fancied
he
saw
the
*NL*
opening
of
a
casement
in
one
of
the
upper
windows
.
The
two
men
were
*NL*
at
this
moment
partially
screened
by
an
elder
bush
,
now
beginning
*NL*
to
be
enriched
with
black
bunches
of
fruit
,
and
they
paused
before
*NL*
emerging
from
its
shade
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
handsome
man
leaned
idly
from
the
lattice
.
He
looked
east
and
then
*NL*
west
,
in
the
manner
of
one
who
makes
a
first
morning
survey
.
The
*NL*
man
was
Sergeant
Troy
.
His
red
jacket
was
loosely
thrown
on
,
but
*NL*
not
buttoned
,
and
he
had
altogether
the
relaxed
bearing
of
a
soldier
*NL*
taking
his
ease
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coggan
spoke
first
,
looking
quietly
at
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
married
him
!
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
had
previously
beheld
the
sight
,
and
he
now
stood
with
his
*NL*
back
turned
,
making
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
fancied
we
should
know
something
to-day
,
''
continued
Coggan
.
``
I
*NL*
heard
wheels
pass
my
door
just
after
dark
--
you
were
out
somewhere
.
''
*NL*
He
glanced
round
upon
Gabriel
.
``
Good
heavens
above
us
,
Oak
,
how
*NL*
white
your
face
is
;
you
look
like
a
corpse
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
I
?
''
said
Oak
,
with
a
faint
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lean
on
the
gate
:
I
'll
wait
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
by
the
gate
awhile
,
Gabriel
listlessly
staring
at
the
*NL*
ground
.
His
mind
sped
into
the
future
,
and
saw
there
enacted
in
*NL*
years
of
leisure
the
scenes
of
repentance
that
would
ensue
from
this
*NL*
work
of
haste
.
That
they
were
married
he
had
instantly
decided
.
Why
*NL*
had
it
been
so
mysteriously
managed
?
It
had
become
known
that
she
*NL*
had
had
a
fearful
journey
to
Bath
,
owing
to
her
miscalculating
the
*NL*
distance
:
that
the
horse
had
broken
down
,
and
that
she
had
been
more
*NL*
than
two
days
getting
there
.
It
was
not
Bathsheba
's
way
to
do
things
*NL*
furtively
.
With
all
her
faults
,
she
was
candour
itself
.
Could
she
*NL*
have
been
entrapped
?
The
union
was
not
only
an
unutterable
grief
to
*NL*
him
:
it
amazed
him
,
notwithstanding
that
he
had
passed
the
preceding
*NL*
week
in
a
suspicion
that
such
might
be
the
issue
of
Troy
's
meeting
*NL*
her
away
from
home
.
Her
quiet
return
with
Liddy
had
to
some
extent
*NL*
dispersed
the
dread
.
Just
as
that
imperceptible
motion
which
appears
*NL*
like
stillness
is
infinitely
divided
in
its
properties
from
stillness
*NL*
itself
,
so
had
his
hope
undistinguishable
from
despair
differed
from
*NL*
despair
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
they
moved
on
again
towards
the
house
.
The
sergeant
*NL*
still
looked
from
the
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Morning
,
comrades
!
''
he
shouted
,
in
a
cheery
voice
,
when
they
came
*NL*
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Coggan
replied
to
the
greeting
.
``
Bai
n't
ye
going
to
answer
the
man
?
''
*NL*
he
then
said
to
Gabriel
.
``
I
'd
say
good
morning
--
you
need
n't
spend
a
*NL*
hapenny
of
meaning
upon
it
,
and
yet
keep
the
man
civil
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
soon
decided
too
that
,
since
the
deed
was
done
,
to
put
the
*NL*
best
face
upon
the
matter
would
be
the
greatest
kindness
to
her
he
*NL*
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
morning
,
Sergeant
Troy
,
''
he
returned
,
in
a
ghastly
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
rambling
,
gloomy
house
this
,
''
said
Troy
,
smiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
they
MAY
not
be
married
!
''
suggested
Coggan
.
``
Perhaps
she
's
not
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
shook
his
head
.
The
soldier
turned
a
little
towards
the
*NL*
east
,
and
the
sun
kindled
his
scarlet
coat
to
an
orange
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
a
nice
old
house
,
''
responded
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
suppose
so
;
but
I
feel
like
new
wine
in
an
old
bottle
here
.
*NL*
My
notion
is
that
sash-windows
should
be
put
throughout
,
and
these
*NL*
old
wainscoted
walls
brightened
up
a
bit
;
or
the
oak
cleared
quite
*NL*
away
,
and
the
walls
papered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
a
pity
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
.
A
philosopher
once
said
in
my
hearing
that
the
old
*NL*
builders
,
who
worked
when
art
was
a
living
thing
,
had
no
respect
*NL*
for
the
work
of
builders
who
went
before
them
,
but
pulled
down
and
*NL*
altered
as
they
thought
fit
;
and
why
should
n't
we
?
`
Creation
and
*NL*
preservation
do
n't
do
well
together
,
'
says
he
,
`
and
a
million
of
*NL*
antiquarians
ca
n't
invent
a
style
.
'
My
mind
exactly
.
I
am
for
making
*NL*
this
place
more
modern
,
that
we
may
be
cheerful
whilst
we
can
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
military
man
turned
and
surveyed
the
interior
of
the
room
,
to
*NL*
assist
his
ideas
of
improvement
in
this
direction
.
Gabriel
and
*NL*
Coggan
began
to
move
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Coggan
,
''
said
Troy
,
as
if
inspired
by
a
recollection
``
do
you
*NL*
know
if
insanity
has
ever
appeared
in
Mr.
Boldwood
's
family
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jan
reflected
for
a
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
once
heard
that
an
uncle
of
his
was
queer
in
his
head
,
but
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
the
rights
o
`
t
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
of
no
importance
,
''
said
Troy
,
lightly
.
``
Well
,
I
shall
be
down
*NL*
in
the
fields
with
you
some
time
this
week
;
but
I
have
a
few
matters
*NL*
to
attend
to
first
.
So
good-day
to
you
.
We
shall
,
of
course
,
keep
*NL*
on
just
as
friendly
terms
as
usual
.
I
'm
not
a
proud
man
:
nobody
is
*NL*
ever
able
to
say
that
of
Sergeant
Troy
.
However
,
what
is
must
be
,
*NL*
and
here
's
half-a-crown
to
drink
my
health
,
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
threw
the
coin
dexterously
across
the
front
plot
and
over
the
*NL*
fence
towards
Gabriel
,
who
shunned
it
in
its
fall
,
his
face
turning
*NL*
to
an
angry
red
.
Coggan
twirled
his
eye
,
edged
forward
,
and
caught
*NL*
the
money
in
its
ricochet
upon
the
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
--
you
keep
it
,
Coggan
,
''
said
Gabriel
with
disdain
and
*NL*
almost
fiercely
.
``
As
for
me
,
I
'll
do
without
gifts
from
him
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
show
it
too
much
,
''
said
Coggan
,
musingly
.
``
For
if
he
's
*NL*
married
to
her
,
mark
my
words
,
he
'll
buy
his
discharge
and
be
our
*NL*
master
here
.
Therefore
't
is
well
to
say
`
Friend
'
outwardly
,
though
*NL*
you
say
`
Troublehouse
'
within
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
perhaps
it
is
best
to
be
silent
;
but
I
ca
n't
go
further
than
*NL*
that
.
I
ca
n't
flatter
,
and
if
my
place
here
is
only
to
be
kept
by
*NL*
smoothing
him
down
,
my
place
must
be
lost
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
horseman
,
whom
they
had
for
some
time
seen
in
the
distance
,
now
*NL*
appeared
close
beside
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
Mr.
Boldwood
,
''
said
Oak
.
``
I
wonder
what
Troy
meant
by
his
*NL*
question
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Coggan
and
Oak
nodded
respectfully
to
the
farmer
,
just
checked
their
*NL*
paces
to
discover
if
they
were
wanted
,
and
finding
they
were
not
*NL*
stood
back
to
let
him
pass
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
signs
of
the
terrible
sorrow
Boldwood
had
been
combating
*NL*
through
the
night
,
and
was
combating
now
,
were
the
want
of
colour
*NL*
in
his
well-defined
face
,
the
enlarged
appearance
of
the
veins
in
*NL*
his
forehead
and
temples
,
and
the
sharper
lines
about
his
mouth
.
*NL*
The
horse
bore
him
away
,
and
the
very
step
of
the
animal
seemed
*NL*
significant
of
dogged
despair
.
Gabriel
,
for
a
minute
,
rose
above
his
*NL*
own
grief
in
noticing
Boldwood
's
.
He
saw
the
square
figure
sitting
*NL*
erect
upon
the
horse
,
the
head
turned
to
neither
side
,
the
elbows
*NL*
steady
by
the
hips
,
the
brim
of
the
hat
level
and
undisturbed
in
*NL*
its
onward
glide
,
until
the
keen
edges
of
Boldwood
's
shape
sank
by
*NL*
degrees
over
the
hill
.
To
one
who
knew
the
man
and
his
story
there
*NL*
was
something
more
striking
in
this
immobility
than
in
a
collapse
.
*NL*
The
clash
of
discord
between
mood
and
matter
here
was
forced
*NL*
painfully
home
to
the
heart
;
and
,
as
in
laughter
there
are
more
*NL*
dreadful
phases
than
in
tears
,
so
was
there
in
the
steadiness
of
*NL*
this
agonized
man
an
expression
deeper
than
a
cry
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
WEALTH
IN
JEOPARDY
--
THE
REVEL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
night
,
at
the
end
of
August
,
when
Bathsheba
's
experiences
as
a
*NL*
married
woman
were
still
new
,
and
when
the
weather
was
yet
dry
and
*NL*
sultry
,
a
man
stood
motionless
in
the
stockyard
of
Weatherbury
Upper
*NL*
Farm
,
looking
at
the
moon
and
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
had
a
sinister
aspect
.
A
heated
breeze
from
the
south
*NL*
slowly
fanned
the
summits
of
lofty
objects
,
and
in
the
sky
dashes
*NL*
of
buoyant
cloud
were
sailing
in
a
course
at
right
angles
to
that
*NL*
of
another
stratum
,
neither
of
them
in
the
direction
of
the
breeze
*NL*
below
.
The
moon
,
as
seen
through
these
films
,
had
a
lurid
metallic
*NL*
look
.
The
fields
were
sallow
with
the
impure
light
,
and
all
were
*NL*
tinged
in
monochrome
,
as
if
beheld
through
stained
glass
.
The
same
*NL*
evening
the
sheep
had
trailed
homeward
head
to
tail
,
the
behaviour
of
*NL*
the
rooks
had
been
confused
,
and
the
horses
had
moved
with
timidity
*NL*
and
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thunder
was
imminent
,
and
,
taking
some
secondary
appearances
into
*NL*
consideration
,
it
was
likely
to
be
followed
by
one
of
the
lengthened
*NL*
rains
which
mark
the
close
of
dry
weather
for
the
season
.
Before
*NL*
twelve
hours
had
passed
a
harvest
atmosphere
would
be
a
bygone
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
gazed
with
misgiving
at
eight
naked
and
unprotected
ricks
,
*NL*
massive
and
heavy
with
the
rich
produce
of
one-half
the
farm
for
*NL*
that
year
.
He
went
on
to
the
barn
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
night
which
had
been
selected
by
Sergeant
Troy
--
ruling
*NL*
now
in
the
room
of
his
wife
--
for
giving
the
harvest
supper
and
dance
.
*NL*
As
Oak
approached
the
building
the
sound
of
violins
and
a
tambourine
,
*NL*
and
the
regular
jigging
of
many
feet
,
grew
more
distinct
.
He
came
*NL*
close
to
the
large
doors
,
one
of
which
stood
slightly
ajar
,
and
*NL*
looked
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
central
space
,
together
with
the
recess
at
one
end
,
was
emptied
*NL*
of
all
incumbrances
,
and
this
area
,
covering
about
two-thirds
of
*NL*
the
whole
,
was
appropriated
for
the
gathering
,
the
remaining
end
,
*NL*
which
was
piled
to
the
ceiling
with
oats
,
being
screened
off
with
*NL*
sail-cloth
.
Tufts
and
garlands
of
green
foliage
decorated
the
walls
,
*NL*
beams
,
and
extemporized
chandeliers
,
and
immediately
opposite
to
Oak
*NL*
a
rostrum
had
been
erected
,
bearing
a
table
and
chairs
.
Here
sat
*NL*
three
fiddlers
,
and
beside
them
stood
a
frantic
man
with
his
hair
*NL*
on
end
,
perspiration
streaming
down
his
cheeks
,
and
a
tambourine
*NL*
quivering
in
his
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dance
ended
,
and
on
the
black
oak
floor
in
the
midst
a
new
row
of
*NL*
couples
formed
for
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
ma'am
,
and
no
offence
I
hope
,
I
ask
what
dance
you
would
like
*NL*
next
?
''
said
the
first
violin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
it
makes
no
difference
,
''
said
the
clear
voice
of
Bathsheba
,
*NL*
who
stood
at
the
inner
end
of
the
building
,
observing
the
scene
from
*NL*
behind
a
table
covered
with
cups
and
viands
.
Troy
was
lolling
beside
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
said
the
fiddler
,
``
I
'll
venture
to
name
that
the
right
and
*NL*
proper
thing
is
`
The
Soldier
's
Joy
'
--
there
being
a
gallant
soldier
*NL*
married
into
the
farm
--
hey
,
my
sonnies
,
and
gentlemen
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
shall
be
`
The
Soldier
's
Joy
,
'
''
exclaimed
a
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thanks
for
the
compliment
,
''
said
the
sergeant
gaily
,
taking
*NL*
Bathsheba
by
the
hand
and
leading
her
to
the
top
of
the
dance
.
``
For
*NL*
though
I
have
purchased
my
discharge
from
Her
Most
Gracious
Majesty
's
*NL*
regiment
of
cavalry
the
11th
Dragoon
Guards
,
to
attend
to
the
new
*NL*
duties
awaiting
me
here
,
I
shall
continue
a
soldier
in
spirit
and
*NL*
feeling
as
long
as
I
live
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
dance
began
.
As
to
the
merits
of
``
The
Soldier
's
Joy
,
''
there
*NL*
can
not
be
,
and
never
were
,
two
opinions
.
It
has
been
observed
in
the
*NL*
musical
circles
of
Weatherbury
and
its
vicinity
that
this
melody
,
at
*NL*
the
end
of
three-quarters
of
an
hour
of
thunderous
footing
,
still
*NL*
possesses
more
stimulative
properties
for
the
heel
and
toe
than
the
*NL*
majority
of
other
dances
at
their
first
opening
.
``
The
Soldier
's
Joy
''
*NL*
has
,
too
,
an
additional
charm
,
in
being
so
admirably
adapted
to
the
*NL*
tambourine
aforesaid
--
no
mean
instrument
in
the
hands
of
a
performer
*NL*
who
understands
the
proper
convulsions
,
spasms
,
St.
Vitus
's
dances
,
*NL*
and
fearful
frenzies
necessary
when
exhibiting
its
tones
in
their
*NL*
highest
perfection
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
immortal
tune
ended
,
a
fine
DD
rolling
forth
from
the
bass-viol
*NL*
with
the
sonorousness
of
a
cannonade
,
and
Gabriel
delayed
his
entry
*NL*
no
longer
.
He
avoided
Bathsheba
,
and
got
as
near
as
possible
*NL*
to
the
platform
,
where
Sergeant
Troy
was
now
seated
,
drinking
*NL*
brandy-and-water
,
though
the
others
drank
without
exception
cider
and
*NL*
ale
.
Gabriel
could
not
easily
thrust
himself
within
speaking
distance
*NL*
of
the
sergeant
,
and
he
sent
a
message
,
asking
him
to
come
down
for
a
*NL*
moment
.
The
sergeant
said
he
could
not
attend
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
tell
him
,
then
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
``
that
I
only
stepped
ath
`
art
*NL*
to
say
that
a
heavy
rain
is
sure
to
fall
soon
,
and
that
something
*NL*
should
be
done
to
protect
the
ricks
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Troy
says
it
will
not
rain
,
''
returned
the
messenger
,
``
and
he
*NL*
can
not
stop
to
talk
to
you
about
such
fidgets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
juxtaposition
with
Troy
,
Oak
had
a
melancholy
tendency
to
look
*NL*
like
a
candle
beside
gas
,
and
ill
at
ease
,
he
went
out
again
,
*NL*
thinking
he
would
go
home
;
for
,
under
the
circumstances
,
he
had
no
*NL*
heart
for
the
scene
in
the
barn
.
At
the
door
he
paused
for
a
moment
:
*NL*
Troy
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Friends
,
it
is
not
only
the
harvest
home
that
we
are
celebrating
*NL*
to-night
;
but
this
is
also
a
Wedding
Feast
.
A
short
time
ago
I
had
*NL*
the
happiness
to
lead
to
the
altar
this
lady
,
your
mistress
,
and
not
*NL*
until
now
have
we
been
able
to
give
any
public
flourish
to
the
event
*NL*
in
Weatherbury
.
That
it
may
be
thoroughly
well
done
,
and
that
every
*NL*
man
may
go
happy
to
bed
,
I
have
ordered
to
be
brought
here
some
*NL*
bottles
of
brandy
and
kettles
of
hot
water
.
A
treble-strong
goblet
*NL*
will
be
handed
round
to
each
guest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
put
her
hand
upon
his
arm
,
and
,
with
upturned
pale
face
,
*NL*
said
imploringly
,
``
No
--
do
n't
give
it
to
them
--
pray
do
n't
,
Frank
!
It
*NL*
will
only
do
them
harm
:
they
have
had
enough
of
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
--
we
do
n't
wish
for
no
more
,
thank
ye
,
''
said
one
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh
!
''
said
the
sergeant
contemptuously
,
and
raised
his
voice
as
*NL*
if
lighted
up
by
a
new
idea
.
``
Friends
,
''
he
said
,
``
we
'll
send
the
*NL*
women-folk
home
!
'T
is
time
they
were
in
bed
.
Then
we
cockbirds
will
*NL*
have
a
jolly
carouse
to
ourselves
!
If
any
of
the
men
show
the
white
*NL*
feather
,
let
them
look
elsewhere
for
a
winter
's
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
indignantly
left
the
barn
,
followed
by
all
the
women
and
*NL*
children
.
The
musicians
,
not
looking
upon
themselves
as
``
company
,
''
*NL*
slipped
quietly
away
to
their
spring
waggon
and
put
in
the
horse
.
*NL*
Thus
Troy
and
the
men
on
the
farm
were
left
sole
occupants
of
the
*NL*
place
.
Oak
,
not
to
appear
unnecessarily
disagreeable
,
stayed
a
*NL*
little
while
;
then
he
,
too
,
arose
and
quietly
took
his
departure
,
*NL*
followed
by
a
friendly
oath
from
the
sergeant
for
not
staying
to
a
*NL*
second
round
of
grog
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
proceeded
towards
his
home
.
In
approaching
the
door
,
his
*NL*
toe
kicked
something
which
felt
and
sounded
soft
,
leathery
,
and
*NL*
distended
,
like
a
boxing-glove
.
It
was
a
large
toad
humbly
*NL*
travelling
across
the
path
.
Oak
took
it
up
,
thinking
it
might
be
*NL*
better
to
kill
the
creature
to
save
it
from
pain
;
but
finding
it
*NL*
uninjured
,
he
placed
it
again
among
the
grass
.
He
knew
what
this
*NL*
direct
message
from
the
Great
Mother
meant
.
And
soon
came
another
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
struck
a
light
indoors
there
appeared
upon
the
table
a
thin
*NL*
glistening
streak
,
as
if
a
brush
of
varnish
had
been
lightly
dragged
*NL*
across
it
.
Oak
's
eyes
followed
the
serpentine
sheen
to
the
other
*NL*
side
,
where
it
led
up
to
a
huge
brown
garden-slug
,
which
had
come
*NL*
indoors
to-night
for
reasons
of
its
own
.
It
was
Nature
's
second
way
*NL*
of
hinting
to
him
that
he
was
to
prepare
for
foul
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
sat
down
meditating
for
nearly
an
hour
.
During
this
time
two
*NL*
black
spiders
,
of
the
kind
common
in
thatched
houses
,
promenaded
the
*NL*
ceiling
,
ultimately
dropping
to
the
floor
.
This
reminded
him
that
*NL*
if
there
was
one
class
of
manifestation
on
this
matter
that
he
*NL*
thoroughly
understood
,
it
was
the
instincts
of
sheep
.
He
left
the
*NL*
room
,
ran
across
two
or
three
fields
towards
the
flock
,
got
upon
a
*NL*
hedge
,
and
looked
over
among
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
crowded
close
together
on
the
other
side
around
some
furze
*NL*
bushes
,
and
the
first
peculiarity
observable
was
that
,
on
the
sudden
*NL*
appearance
of
Oak
's
head
over
the
fence
,
they
did
not
stir
or
run
*NL*
away
.
They
had
now
a
terror
of
something
greater
than
their
terror
*NL*
of
man
.
But
this
was
not
the
most
noteworthy
feature
:
they
were
all
*NL*
grouped
in
such
a
way
that
their
tails
,
without
a
single
exception
,
*NL*
were
towards
that
half
of
the
horizon
from
which
the
storm
*NL*
threatened
.
There
was
an
inner
circle
closely
huddled
,
and
outside
*NL*
these
they
radiated
wider
apart
,
the
pattern
formed
by
the
flock
as
a
*NL*
whole
not
being
unlike
a
vandyked
lace
collar
,
to
which
the
clump
of
*NL*
furze-bushes
stood
in
the
position
of
a
wearer
's
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
enough
to
re-establish
him
in
his
original
opinion
.
He
knew
*NL*
now
that
he
was
right
,
and
that
Troy
was
wrong
.
Every
voice
in
nature
*NL*
was
unanimous
in
bespeaking
change
.
But
two
distinct
translations
*NL*
attached
to
these
dumb
expressions
.
Apparently
there
was
to
be
a
*NL*
thunder-storm
,
and
afterwards
a
cold
continuous
rain
.
The
creeping
*NL*
things
seemed
to
know
all
about
the
later
rain
,
but
little
of
the
*NL*
interpolated
thunder-storm
;
whilst
the
sheep
knew
all
about
the
*NL*
thunder-storm
and
nothing
of
the
later
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
complication
of
weathers
being
uncommon
,
was
all
the
more
to
be
*NL*
feared
.
Oak
returned
to
the
stack-yard
.
All
was
silent
here
,
and
*NL*
the
conical
tips
of
the
ricks
jutted
darkly
into
the
sky
.
There
were
*NL*
five
wheat-ricks
in
this
yard
,
and
three
stacks
of
barley
.
The
wheat
*NL*
when
threshed
would
average
about
thirty
quarters
to
each
stack
;
the
*NL*
barley
,
at
least
forty
.
Their
value
to
Bathsheba
,
and
indeed
to
*NL*
anybody
,
Oak
mentally
estimated
by
the
following
simple
*NL*
calculation
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
5
x
30
=
150
quarters
=
500
L.
*NL*
3
x
40
=
120
quarters
=
250
L.
*NL*
-------
*NL*
Total
.
.
750
L.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
in
the
divinest
form
that
money
can
*NL*
wear
--
that
of
necessary
food
for
man
and
beast
:
should
the
risk
be
*NL*
run
of
deteriorating
this
bulk
of
corn
to
less
than
half
its
value
,
*NL*
because
of
the
instability
of
a
woman
?
``
Never
,
if
I
can
prevent
it
!
''
*NL*
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
argument
that
Oak
set
outwardly
before
him
.
But
man
,
*NL*
even
to
himself
,
is
a
palimpsest
,
having
an
ostensible
writing
,
and
*NL*
another
beneath
the
lines
.
It
is
possible
that
there
was
this
golden
*NL*
legend
under
the
utilitarian
one
:
``
I
will
help
to
my
last
effort
the
*NL*
woman
I
have
loved
so
dearly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
back
to
the
barn
to
endeavour
to
obtain
assistance
for
*NL*
covering
the
ricks
that
very
night
.
All
was
silent
within
,
and
he
*NL*
would
have
passed
on
in
the
belief
that
the
party
had
broken
up
,
had
*NL*
not
a
dim
light
,
yellow
as
saffron
by
contrast
with
the
greenish
*NL*
whiteness
outside
,
streamed
through
a
knot-hole
in
the
folding
doors
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
looked
in
.
An
unusual
picture
met
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candles
suspended
among
the
evergreens
had
burnt
down
to
their
*NL*
sockets
,
and
in
some
cases
the
leaves
tied
about
them
were
scorched
.
*NL*
Many
of
the
lights
had
quite
gone
out
,
others
smoked
and
stank
,
*NL*
grease
dropping
from
them
upon
the
floor
.
Here
,
under
the
table
,
and
*NL*
leaning
against
forms
and
chairs
in
every
conceivable
attitude
except
*NL*
the
perpendicular
,
were
the
wretched
persons
of
all
the
work-folk
,
*NL*
the
hair
of
their
heads
at
such
low
levels
being
suggestive
of
mops
*NL*
and
brooms
.
In
the
midst
of
these
shone
red
and
distinct
the
figure
*NL*
of
Sergeant
Troy
,
leaning
back
in
a
chair
.
Coggan
was
on
his
back
,
*NL*
with
his
mouth
open
,
huzzing
forth
snores
,
as
were
several
others
;
*NL*
the
united
breathings
of
the
horizonal
assemblage
forming
a
subdued
*NL*
roar
like
London
from
a
distance
.
Joseph
Poorgrass
was
curled
round
*NL*
in
the
fashion
of
a
hedge-hog
,
apparently
in
attempts
to
present
the
*NL*
least
possible
portion
of
his
surface
to
the
air
;
and
behind
him
*NL*
was
dimly
visible
an
unimportant
remnant
of
William
Smallbury
.
*NL*
The
glasses
and
cups
still
stood
upon
the
table
,
a
water-jug
being
*NL*
overturned
,
from
which
a
small
rill
,
after
tracing
its
course
with
*NL*
marvellous
precision
down
the
centre
of
the
long
table
,
fell
into
the
*NL*
neck
of
the
unconscious
Mark
Clark
,
in
a
steady
,
monotonous
drip
,
*NL*
like
the
dripping
of
a
stalactite
in
a
cave
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
glanced
hopelessly
at
the
group
,
which
,
with
one
or
two
*NL*
exceptions
,
composed
all
the
able-bodied
men
upon
the
farm
.
He
saw
*NL*
at
once
that
if
the
ricks
were
to
be
saved
that
night
,
or
even
the
*NL*
next
morning
,
he
must
save
them
with
his
own
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
faint
``
ting-ting
''
resounded
from
under
Coggan
's
waistcoat
.
It
was
*NL*
Coggan
's
watch
striking
the
hour
of
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
went
to
the
recumbent
form
of
Matthew
Moon
,
who
usually
undertook
*NL*
the
rough
thatching
of
the
home-stead
,
and
shook
him
.
The
shaking
*NL*
was
without
effect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
shouted
in
his
ear
,
``
where
's
your
thatching-beetle
and
*NL*
rick-stick
and
spars
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Under
the
staddles
,
''
said
Moon
,
mechanically
,
with
the
unconscious
*NL*
promptness
of
a
medium
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
let
go
his
head
,
and
it
dropped
upon
the
floor
like
a
bowl
.
*NL*
He
then
went
to
Susan
Tall
's
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
's
the
key
of
the
granary
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
answer
.
The
question
was
repeated
,
with
the
same
result
.
To
be
*NL*
shouted
to
at
night
was
evidently
less
of
a
novelty
to
Susan
Tall
's
*NL*
husband
than
to
Matthew
Moon
.
Oak
flung
down
Tall
's
head
into
the
*NL*
corner
again
and
turned
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
be
just
,
the
men
were
not
greatly
to
blame
for
this
painful
and
*NL*
demoralizing
termination
to
the
evening
's
entertainment
.
Sergeant
*NL*
Troy
had
so
strenuously
insisted
,
glass
in
hand
,
that
drinking
should
*NL*
be
the
bond
of
their
union
,
that
those
who
wished
to
refuse
hardly
*NL*
liked
to
be
so
unmannerly
under
the
circumstances
.
Having
from
their
*NL*
youth
up
been
entirely
unaccustomed
to
any
liquor
stronger
than
cider
*NL*
or
mild
ale
,
it
was
no
wonder
that
they
had
succumbed
,
one
and
all
,
*NL*
with
extraordinary
uniformity
,
after
the
lapse
of
about
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
was
greatly
depressed
.
This
debauch
boded
ill
for
that
*NL*
wilful
and
fascinating
mistress
whom
the
faithful
man
even
now
felt
*NL*
within
him
as
the
embodiment
of
all
that
was
sweet
and
bright
and
*NL*
hopeless
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
out
the
expiring
lights
,
that
the
barn
might
not
be
*NL*
endangered
,
closed
the
door
upon
the
men
in
their
deep
and
oblivious
*NL*
sleep
,
and
went
again
into
the
lone
night
.
A
hot
breeze
,
as
if
*NL*
breathed
from
the
parted
lips
of
some
dragon
about
to
swallow
the
*NL*
globe
,
fanned
him
from
the
south
,
while
directly
opposite
in
the
*NL*
north
rose
a
grim
misshapen
body
of
cloud
,
in
the
very
teeth
of
the
*NL*
wind
.
So
unnaturally
did
it
rise
that
one
could
fancy
it
to
be
*NL*
lifted
by
machinery
from
below
.
Meanwhile
the
faint
cloudlets
had
*NL*
flown
back
into
the
south-east
corner
of
the
sky
,
as
if
in
terror
of
*NL*
the
large
cloud
,
like
a
young
brood
gazed
in
upon
by
some
monster
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
on
to
the
village
,
Oak
flung
a
small
stone
against
the
window
*NL*
of
Laban
Tall
's
bedroom
,
expecting
Susan
to
open
it
;
but
nobody
*NL*
stirred
.
He
went
round
to
the
back
door
,
which
had
been
left
*NL*
unfastened
for
Laban
's
entry
,
and
passed
in
to
the
foot
of
the
*NL*
staircase
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Tall
,
I
've
come
for
the
key
of
the
granary
,
to
get
at
the
*NL*
rick-cloths
,
''
said
Oak
,
in
a
stentorian
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
?
''
said
Mrs.
Susan
Tall
,
half
awake
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
along
to
bed
,
do
,
you
drawlatching
rogue
--
keeping
a
body
awake
*NL*
like
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
Laban
--
't
is
Gabriel
Oak
.
I
want
the
key
of
the
granary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
!
What
in
the
name
of
fortune
did
you
pretend
to
be
Laban
*NL*
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
.
I
thought
you
meant
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
you
did
!
What
do
you
want
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
key
of
the
granary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
it
then
.
'T
is
on
the
nail
.
People
coming
disturbing
women
at
*NL*
this
time
of
night
ought
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
took
the
key
,
without
waiting
to
hear
the
conclusion
of
the
*NL*
tirade
.
Ten
minutes
later
his
lonely
figure
might
have
been
seen
*NL*
dragging
four
large
water-proof
coverings
across
the
yard
,
and
soon
*NL*
two
of
these
heaps
of
treasure
in
grain
were
covered
snug
--
two
cloths
*NL*
to
each
.
Two
hundred
pounds
were
secured
.
Three
wheat-stacks
*NL*
remained
open
,
and
there
were
no
more
cloths
.
Oak
looked
under
the
*NL*
staddles
and
found
a
fork
.
He
mounted
the
third
pile
of
wealth
and
*NL*
began
operating
,
adopting
the
plan
of
sloping
the
upper
sheaves
one
*NL*
over
the
other
;
and
,
in
addition
,
filling
the
interstices
with
the
*NL*
material
of
some
untied
sheaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
far
all
was
well
.
By
this
hurried
contrivance
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
property
in
wheat
was
safe
for
at
any
rate
a
week
or
two
,
provided
*NL*
always
that
there
was
not
much
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
came
the
barley
.
This
it
was
only
possible
to
protect
by
*NL*
systematic
thatching
.
Time
went
on
,
and
the
moon
vanished
not
to
*NL*
reappear
.
It
was
the
farewell
of
the
ambassador
previous
to
war
.
*NL*
The
night
had
a
haggard
look
,
like
a
sick
thing
;
and
there
came
*NL*
finally
an
utter
expiration
of
air
from
the
whole
heaven
in
the
form
*NL*
of
a
slow
breeze
,
which
might
have
been
likened
to
a
death
.
And
now
*NL*
nothing
was
heard
in
the
yard
but
the
dull
thuds
of
the
beetle
which
*NL*
drove
in
the
spars
,
and
the
rustle
of
thatch
in
the
intervals
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
STORM
--
THE
TWO
TOGETHER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
light
flapped
over
the
scene
,
as
if
reflected
from
phosphorescent
*NL*
wings
crossing
the
sky
,
and
a
rumble
filled
the
air
.
It
was
the
*NL*
first
move
of
the
approaching
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
peal
was
noisy
,
with
comparatively
little
visible
*NL*
lightning
.
Gabriel
saw
a
candle
shining
in
Bathsheba
's
bedroom
,
*NL*
and
soon
a
shadow
swept
to
and
fro
upon
the
blind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
came
a
third
flash
.
Manoeuvres
of
a
most
extraordinary
*NL*
kind
were
going
on
in
the
vast
firmamental
hollows
overhead
.
The
*NL*
lightning
now
was
the
colour
of
silver
,
and
gleamed
in
the
heavens
*NL*
like
a
mailed
army
.
Rumbles
became
rattles
.
Gabriel
from
his
*NL*
elevated
position
could
see
over
the
landscape
at
least
half-a-dozen
*NL*
miles
in
front
.
Every
hedge
,
bush
,
and
tree
was
distinct
as
in
a
*NL*
line
engraving
.
In
a
paddock
in
the
same
direction
was
a
herd
of
*NL*
heifers
,
and
the
forms
of
these
were
visible
at
this
moment
in
the
*NL*
act
of
galloping
about
in
the
wildest
and
maddest
confusion
,
flinging
*NL*
their
heels
and
tails
high
into
the
air
,
their
heads
to
earth
.
*NL*
A
poplar
in
the
immediate
foreground
was
like
an
ink
stroke
on
*NL*
burnished
tin
.
Then
the
picture
vanished
,
leaving
the
darkness
so
*NL*
intense
that
Gabriel
worked
entirely
by
feeling
with
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
stuck
his
ricking-rod
,
or
poniard
,
as
it
was
indifferently
*NL*
called
--
a
long
iron
lance
,
polished
by
handling
--
into
the
stack
,
*NL*
used
to
support
the
sheaves
instead
of
the
support
called
a
groom
*NL*
used
on
houses
.
A
blue
light
appeared
in
the
zenith
,
and
in
some
*NL*
indescribable
manner
flickered
down
near
the
top
of
the
rod
.
It
*NL*
was
the
fourth
of
the
larger
flashes
.
A
moment
later
and
there
was
*NL*
a
smack
--
smart
,
clear
,
and
short
.
Gabriel
felt
his
position
to
be
*NL*
anything
but
a
safe
one
,
and
he
resolved
to
descend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
a
drop
of
rain
had
fallen
as
yet
.
He
wiped
his
weary
brow
,
and
*NL*
looked
again
at
the
black
forms
of
the
unprotected
stacks
.
Was
his
*NL*
life
so
valuable
to
him
after
all
?
What
were
his
prospects
that
he
*NL*
should
be
so
chary
of
running
risk
,
when
important
and
urgent
labour
*NL*
could
not
be
carried
on
without
such
risk
?
He
resolved
to
stick
to
*NL*
the
stack
.
However
,
he
took
a
precaution
.
Under
the
staddles
was
a
*NL*
long
tethering
chain
,
used
to
prevent
the
escape
of
errant
horses
.
*NL*
This
he
carried
up
the
ladder
,
and
sticking
his
rod
through
the
clog
*NL*
at
one
end
,
allowed
the
other
end
of
the
chain
to
trail
upon
the
*NL*
ground
.
The
spike
attached
to
it
he
drove
in
.
Under
the
shadow
of
*NL*
this
extemporized
lightning-conductor
he
felt
himself
comparatively
*NL*
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Oak
had
laid
his
hands
upon
his
tools
again
out
leapt
the
*NL*
fifth
flash
,
with
the
spring
of
a
serpent
and
the
shout
of
a
fiend
.
*NL*
It
was
green
as
an
emerald
,
and
the
reverberation
was
stunning
.
What
*NL*
was
this
the
light
revealed
to
him
?
In
the
open
ground
before
him
,
*NL*
as
he
looked
over
the
ridge
of
the
rick
,
was
a
dark
and
apparently
*NL*
female
form
.
Could
it
be
that
of
the
only
venturesome
woman
in
the
*NL*
parish
--
Bathsheba
?
The
form
moved
on
a
step
:
then
he
could
see
no
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
ma'am
?
''
said
Gabriel
to
the
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
is
there
?
''
said
the
voice
of
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
.
I
am
on
the
rick
,
thatching
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Gabriel
!
--
and
are
you
?
I
have
come
about
them
.
The
weather
*NL*
awoke
me
,
and
I
thought
of
the
corn
.
I
am
so
distressed
about
*NL*
it
--
can
we
save
it
anyhow
?
I
can
not
find
my
husband
.
Is
he
with
*NL*
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
not
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
where
he
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Asleep
in
the
barn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
promised
that
the
stacks
should
be
seen
to
,
and
now
they
are
all
*NL*
neglected
!
Can
I
do
anything
to
help
?
Liddy
is
afraid
to
come
out
.
*NL*
Fancy
finding
you
here
at
such
an
hour
!
Surely
I
can
do
something
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
bring
up
some
reed-sheaves
to
me
,
one
by
one
,
ma'am
;
if
you
*NL*
are
not
afraid
to
come
up
the
ladder
in
the
dark
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
``
Every
moment
is
precious
now
,
and
that
would
save
a
good
deal
of
*NL*
time
.
It
is
not
very
dark
when
the
lightning
has
been
gone
a
bit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
do
anything
!
''
she
said
,
resolutely
.
She
instantly
took
a
sheaf
*NL*
upon
her
shoulder
,
clambered
up
close
to
his
heels
,
placed
it
behind
*NL*
the
rod
,
and
descended
for
another
.
At
her
third
ascent
the
rick
*NL*
suddenly
brightened
with
the
brazen
glare
of
shining
majolica
--
every
*NL*
knot
in
every
straw
was
visible
.
On
the
slope
in
front
of
him
*NL*
appeared
two
human
shapes
,
black
as
jet
.
The
rick
lost
its
*NL*
sheen
--
the
shapes
vanished
.
Gabriel
turned
his
head
.
It
had
been
*NL*
the
sixth
flash
which
had
come
from
the
east
behind
him
,
and
the
two
*NL*
dark
forms
on
the
slope
had
been
the
shadows
of
himself
and
*NL*
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
came
the
peal
.
It
hardly
was
credible
that
such
a
heavenly
*NL*
light
could
be
the
parent
of
such
a
diabolical
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
terrible
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
and
clutched
him
by
the
sleeve
.
*NL*
Gabriel
turned
,
and
steadied
her
on
her
aerial
perch
by
holding
*NL*
her
arm
.
At
the
same
moment
,
while
he
was
still
reversed
in
his
*NL*
attitude
,
there
was
more
light
,
and
he
saw
,
as
it
were
,
a
copy
of
the
*NL*
tall
poplar
tree
on
the
hill
drawn
in
black
on
the
wall
of
the
barn
.
*NL*
It
was
the
shadow
of
that
tree
,
thrown
across
by
a
secondary
flash
*NL*
in
the
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
flare
came
.
Bathsheba
was
on
the
ground
now
,
shouldering
*NL*
another
sheaf
,
and
she
bore
its
dazzle
without
flinching
--
thunder
*NL*
and
all
--
and
again
ascended
with
the
load
.
There
was
then
a
silence
*NL*
everywhere
for
four
or
five
minutes
,
and
the
crunch
of
the
spars
,
as
*NL*
Gabriel
hastily
drove
them
in
,
could
again
be
distinctly
heard
.
He
*NL*
thought
the
crisis
of
the
storm
had
passed
.
But
there
came
a
burst
*NL*
of
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hold
on
!
''
said
Gabriel
,
taking
the
sheaf
from
her
shoulder
,
and
*NL*
grasping
her
arm
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Heaven
opened
then
,
indeed
.
The
flash
was
almost
too
novel
for
its
*NL*
inexpressibly
dangerous
nature
to
be
at
once
realized
,
and
they
could
*NL*
only
comprehend
the
magnificence
of
its
beauty
.
It
sprang
from
*NL*
east
,
west
,
north
,
south
,
and
was
a
perfect
dance
of
death
.
The
*NL*
forms
of
skeletons
appeared
in
the
air
,
shaped
with
blue
fire
for
*NL*
bones
--
dancing
,
leaping
,
striding
,
racing
around
,
and
mingling
*NL*
altogether
in
unparalleled
confusion
.
With
these
were
intertwined
*NL*
undulating
snakes
of
green
,
and
behind
these
was
a
broad
mass
of
*NL*
lesser
light
.
Simultaneously
came
from
every
part
of
the
tumbling
*NL*
sky
what
may
be
called
a
shout
;
since
,
though
no
shout
ever
came
*NL*
near
it
,
it
was
more
of
the
nature
of
a
shout
than
of
anything
else
*NL*
earthly
.
In
the
meantime
one
of
the
grisly
forms
had
alighted
upon
*NL*
the
point
of
Gabriel
's
rod
,
to
run
invisibly
down
it
,
down
the
chain
,
*NL*
and
into
the
earth
.
Gabriel
was
almost
blinded
,
and
he
could
feel
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
warm
arm
tremble
in
his
hand
--
a
sensation
novel
and
*NL*
thrilling
enough
;
but
love
,
life
,
everything
human
,
seemed
small
and
*NL*
trifling
in
such
close
juxtaposition
with
an
infuriated
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
had
hardly
time
to
gather
up
these
impressions
into
a
thought
,
*NL*
and
to
see
how
strangely
the
red
feather
of
her
hat
shone
in
this
*NL*
light
,
when
the
tall
tree
on
the
hill
before
mentioned
seemed
on
fire
*NL*
to
a
white
heat
,
and
a
new
one
among
these
terrible
voices
mingled
*NL*
with
the
last
crash
of
those
preceding
.
It
was
a
stupefying
blast
,
*NL*
harsh
and
pitiless
,
and
it
fell
upon
their
ears
in
a
dead
,
flat
blow
,
*NL*
without
that
reverberation
which
lends
the
tones
of
a
drum
to
more
*NL*
distant
thunder
.
By
the
lustre
reflected
from
every
part
of
the
*NL*
earth
and
from
the
wide
domical
scoop
above
it
,
he
saw
that
the
*NL*
tree
was
sliced
down
the
whole
length
of
its
tall
,
straight
stem
,
a
*NL*
huge
riband
of
bark
being
apparently
flung
off
.
The
other
portion
*NL*
remained
erect
,
and
revealed
the
bared
surface
as
a
strip
of
white
*NL*
down
the
front
.
The
lightning
had
struck
the
tree
.
A
sulphurous
*NL*
smell
filled
the
air
;
then
all
was
silent
,
and
black
as
a
cave
in
*NL*
Hinnom
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
had
a
narrow
escape
!
''
said
Gabriel
,
hurriedly
.
``
You
had
better
*NL*
go
down
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
said
nothing
;
but
he
could
distinctly
hear
her
rhythmical
*NL*
pants
,
and
the
recurrent
rustle
of
the
sheaf
beside
her
in
response
*NL*
to
her
frightened
pulsations
.
She
descended
the
ladder
,
and
,
on
*NL*
second
thoughts
,
he
followed
her
.
The
darkness
was
now
impenetrable
*NL*
by
the
sharpest
vision
.
They
both
stood
still
at
the
bottom
,
side
by
*NL*
side
.
Bathsheba
appeared
to
think
only
of
the
weather
--
Oak
thought
*NL*
only
of
her
just
then
.
At
last
he
said
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
storm
seems
to
have
passed
now
,
at
any
rate
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
``
Though
there
are
multitudes
of
*NL*
gleams
,
look
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
sky
was
now
filled
with
an
incessant
light
,
frequent
repetition
*NL*
melting
into
complete
continuity
,
as
an
unbroken
sound
results
from
*NL*
the
successive
strokes
on
a
gong
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
serious
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
can
not
understand
no
rain
falling
.
*NL*
But
Heaven
be
praised
,
it
is
all
the
better
for
us
.
I
am
now
going
*NL*
up
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
,
you
are
kinder
than
I
deserve
!
I
will
stay
and
help
you
*NL*
yet
.
Oh
,
why
are
not
some
of
the
others
here
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
would
have
been
here
if
they
could
,
''
said
Oak
,
in
a
hesitating
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
,
I
know
it
all
--
all
,
''
she
said
,
adding
slowly
:
``
They
are
all
*NL*
asleep
in
the
barn
,
in
a
drunken
sleep
,
and
my
husband
among
them
.
*NL*
That
's
it
,
is
it
not
?
Do
n't
think
I
am
a
timid
woman
and
ca
n't
*NL*
endure
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
certain
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
I
will
go
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
crossed
to
the
barn
,
leaving
her
there
alone
.
He
looked
through
*NL*
the
chinks
of
the
door
.
All
was
in
total
darkness
,
as
he
had
left
*NL*
it
,
and
there
still
arose
,
as
at
the
former
time
,
the
steady
buzz
of
*NL*
many
snores
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
a
zephyr
curling
about
his
cheek
,
and
turned
.
It
was
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
breath
--
she
had
followed
him
,
and
was
looking
into
the
*NL*
same
chink
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
endeavoured
to
put
off
the
immediate
and
painful
subject
of
*NL*
their
thoughts
by
remarking
gently
,
``
If
you
'll
come
back
again
,
*NL*
miss
--
ma'am
,
and
hand
up
a
few
more
;
it
would
save
much
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Oak
went
back
again
,
ascended
to
the
top
,
stepped
off
the
ladder
*NL*
for
greater
expedition
,
and
went
on
thatching
.
She
followed
,
but
*NL*
without
a
sheaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
,
''
she
said
,
in
a
strange
and
impressive
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
looked
up
at
her
.
She
had
not
spoken
since
he
left
the
barn
.
*NL*
The
soft
and
continual
shimmer
of
the
dying
lightning
showed
a
marble
*NL*
face
high
against
the
black
sky
of
the
opposite
quarter
.
Bathsheba
*NL*
was
sitting
almost
on
the
apex
of
the
stack
,
her
feet
gathered
up
*NL*
beneath
her
,
and
resting
on
the
top
round
of
the
ladder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
mistress
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
you
thought
that
when
I
galloped
away
to
Bath
that
night
*NL*
it
was
on
purpose
to
be
married
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
at
last
--
not
at
first
,
''
he
answered
,
somewhat
surprised
at
the
*NL*
abruptness
with
which
this
new
subject
was
broached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
others
thought
so
,
too
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
blamed
me
for
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
a
little
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
so
.
Now
,
I
care
a
little
for
your
good
opinion
,
and
*NL*
I
want
to
explain
something
--
I
have
longed
to
do
it
ever
since
I
*NL*
returned
,
and
you
looked
so
gravely
at
me
.
For
if
I
were
to
die
--
and
*NL*
I
may
die
soon
--
it
would
be
dreadful
that
you
should
always
think
*NL*
mistakenly
of
me
.
Now
,
listen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
ceased
his
rustling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
went
to
Bath
that
night
in
the
full
intention
of
breaking
off
my
*NL*
engagement
to
Mr.
Troy
.
It
was
owing
to
circumstances
which
occurred
*NL*
after
I
got
there
that
--
that
we
were
married
.
Now
,
do
you
see
the
*NL*
matter
in
a
new
light
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
--
somewhat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
,
I
suppose
,
say
more
,
now
that
I
have
begun
.
And
perhaps
*NL*
it
's
no
harm
,
for
you
are
certainly
under
no
delusion
that
I
ever
*NL*
loved
you
,
or
that
I
can
have
any
object
in
speaking
,
more
than
that
*NL*
object
I
have
mentioned
.
Well
,
I
was
alone
in
a
strange
city
,
and
*NL*
the
horse
was
lame
.
And
at
last
I
did
n't
know
what
to
do
.
I
saw
,
*NL*
when
it
was
too
late
,
that
scandal
might
seize
hold
of
me
for
meeting
*NL*
him
alone
in
that
way
.
But
I
was
coming
away
,
when
he
suddenly
said
*NL*
he
had
that
day
seen
a
woman
more
beautiful
than
I
,
and
that
his
*NL*
constancy
could
not
be
counted
on
unless
I
at
once
became
his
...
*NL*
And
I
was
grieved
and
troubled
--
''
She
cleared
her
voice
,
and
waited
*NL*
a
moment
,
as
if
to
gather
breath
.
``
And
then
,
between
jealousy
*NL*
and
distraction
,
I
married
him
!
''
she
whispered
with
desperate
*NL*
impetuosity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
not
to
blame
,
for
it
was
perfectly
true
about
--
about
his
*NL*
seeing
somebody
else
,
''
she
quickly
added
.
``
And
now
I
do
n't
wish
for
*NL*
a
single
remark
from
you
upon
the
subject
--
indeed
,
I
forbid
it
.
I
*NL*
only
wanted
you
to
know
that
misunderstood
bit
of
my
history
before
*NL*
a
time
comes
when
you
could
never
know
it
.
--
You
want
some
more
*NL*
sheaves
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
down
the
ladder
,
and
the
work
proceeded
.
Gabriel
soon
*NL*
perceived
a
languor
in
the
movements
of
his
mistress
up
and
down
,
and
*NL*
he
said
to
her
,
gently
as
a
mother
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
you
had
better
go
indoors
now
,
you
are
tired
.
I
can
finish
*NL*
the
rest
alone
.
If
the
wind
does
not
change
the
rain
is
likely
to
*NL*
keep
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
am
useless
I
will
go
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
in
a
flagging
cadence
.
*NL*
``
But
O
,
if
your
life
should
be
lost
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
useless
;
but
I
would
rather
not
tire
you
longer
.
You
*NL*
have
done
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
better
!
''
she
said
,
gratefully
.
``
Thank
you
for
your
*NL*
devotion
,
a
thousand
times
,
Gabriel
!
Goodnight
--
I
know
you
are
doing
*NL*
your
very
best
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
diminished
in
the
gloom
,
and
vanished
,
and
he
heard
the
latch
*NL*
of
the
gate
fall
as
she
passed
through
.
He
worked
in
a
reverie
*NL*
now
,
musing
upon
her
story
,
and
upon
the
contradictoriness
of
that
*NL*
feminine
heart
which
had
caused
her
to
speak
more
warmly
to
him
*NL*
to-night
than
she
ever
had
done
whilst
unmarried
and
free
to
speak
*NL*
as
warmly
as
she
chose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
disturbed
in
his
meditation
by
a
grating
noise
from
the
*NL*
coach-house
.
It
was
the
vane
on
the
roof
turning
round
,
and
this
*NL*
change
in
the
wind
was
the
signal
for
a
disastrous
rain
.

*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
RAIN
--
ONE
SOLITARY
MEETS
ANOTHER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
now
five
o'clock
,
and
the
dawn
was
promising
to
break
in
hues
*NL*
of
drab
and
ash
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
changed
its
temperature
and
stirred
itself
more
vigorously
.
*NL*
Cool
breezes
coursed
in
transparent
eddies
round
Oak
's
face
.
The
*NL*
wind
shifted
yet
a
point
or
two
and
blew
stronger
.
In
ten
minutes
*NL*
every
wind
of
heaven
seemed
to
be
roaming
at
large
.
Some
of
the
*NL*
thatching
on
the
wheat-stacks
was
now
whirled
fantastically
aloft
,
*NL*
and
had
to
be
replaced
and
weighted
with
some
rails
that
lay
near
at
*NL*
hand
.
This
done
,
Oak
slaved
away
again
at
the
barley
.
A
huge
drop
*NL*
of
rain
smote
his
face
,
the
wind
snarled
round
every
corner
,
the
*NL*
trees
rocked
to
the
bases
of
their
trunks
,
and
the
twigs
clashed
in
*NL*
strife
.
Driving
in
spars
at
any
point
and
on
any
system
,
inch
by
*NL*
inch
he
covered
more
and
more
safely
from
ruin
this
distracting
*NL*
impersonation
of
seven
hundred
pounds
.
The
rain
came
on
in
earnest
,
*NL*
and
Oak
soon
felt
the
water
to
be
tracking
cold
and
clammy
routes
*NL*
down
his
back
.
Ultimately
he
was
reduced
well-nigh
to
a
homogeneous
*NL*
sop
,
and
the
dyes
of
his
clothes
trickled
down
and
stood
in
a
pool
*NL*
at
the
foot
of
the
ladder
.
The
rain
stretched
obliquely
through
the
*NL*
dull
atmosphere
in
liquid
spines
,
unbroken
in
continuity
between
*NL*
their
beginnings
in
the
clouds
and
their
points
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
suddenly
remembered
that
eight
months
before
this
time
he
had
*NL*
been
fighting
against
fire
in
the
same
spot
as
desperately
as
he
*NL*
was
fighting
against
water
now
--
and
for
a
futile
love
of
the
same
*NL*
woman
.
As
for
her
--
But
Oak
was
generous
and
true
,
and
dismissed
*NL*
his
reflections
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
seven
o'clock
in
the
dark
leaden
morning
when
Gabriel
*NL*
came
down
from
the
last
stack
,
and
thankfully
exclaimed
,
``
It
is
*NL*
done
!
''
He
was
drenched
,
weary
,
and
sad
,
and
yet
not
so
sad
as
*NL*
drenched
and
weary
,
for
he
was
cheered
by
a
sense
of
success
in
a
*NL*
good
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Faint
sounds
came
from
the
barn
,
and
he
looked
that
way
.
Figures
*NL*
stepped
singly
and
in
pairs
through
the
doors
--
all
walking
awkwardly
,
*NL*
and
abashed
,
save
the
foremost
,
who
wore
a
red
jacket
,
and
advanced
*NL*
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
,
whistling
.
The
others
shambled
after
*NL*
with
a
conscience-stricken
air
:
the
whole
procession
was
not
unlike
*NL*
Flaxman
's
group
of
the
suitors
tottering
on
towards
the
infernal
*NL*
regions
under
the
conduct
of
Mercury
.
The
gnarled
shapes
passed
*NL*
into
the
village
,
Troy
,
their
leader
,
entering
the
farmhouse
.
Not
a
*NL*
single
one
of
them
had
turned
his
face
to
the
ricks
,
or
apparently
*NL*
bestowed
one
thought
upon
their
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
Oak
too
went
homeward
,
by
a
different
route
from
theirs
.
In
*NL*
front
of
him
against
the
wet
glazed
surface
of
the
lane
he
saw
a
*NL*
person
walking
yet
more
slowly
than
himself
under
an
umbrella
.
The
*NL*
man
turned
and
plainly
started
;
he
was
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
are
you
this
morning
,
sir
?
''
said
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
a
wet
day
.
--
Oh
,
I
am
well
,
very
well
,
I
thank
you
;
quite
*NL*
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
hear
it
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
seemed
to
awake
to
the
present
by
degrees
.
``
You
look
tired
*NL*
and
ill
,
Oak
,
''
he
said
then
,
desultorily
regarding
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
tired
.
You
look
strangely
altered
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
?
Not
a
bit
of
it
:
I
am
well
enough
.
What
put
that
into
your
*NL*
head
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
did
n't
look
quite
so
topping
as
you
used
to
,
that
was
*NL*
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
then
you
are
mistaken
,
''
said
Boldwood
,
shortly
.
``
Nothing
*NL*
hurts
me
.
My
constitution
is
an
iron
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
working
hard
to
get
our
ricks
covered
,
and
was
barely
in
*NL*
time
.
Never
had
such
a
struggle
in
my
life
...
Yours
of
course
are
*NL*
safe
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
''
Boldwood
added
,
after
an
interval
of
silence
:
``
What
did
you
*NL*
ask
,
Oak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
ricks
are
all
covered
before
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
the
large
ones
upon
the
stone
staddles
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Them
under
the
hedge
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
forgot
to
tell
the
thatcher
to
set
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
the
little
one
by
the
stile
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
the
little
one
by
the
stile
.
I
overlooked
the
ricks
this
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
not
a
tenth
of
your
corn
will
come
to
measure
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Possibly
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Overlooked
them
,
''
repeated
Gabriel
slowly
to
himself
.
It
is
*NL*
difficult
to
describe
the
intensely
dramatic
effect
that
announcement
*NL*
had
upon
Oak
at
such
a
moment
.
All
the
night
he
had
been
feeling
*NL*
that
the
neglect
he
was
labouring
to
repair
was
abnormal
and
*NL*
isolated
--
the
only
instance
of
the
kind
within
the
circuit
of
the
*NL*
county
.
Yet
at
this
very
time
,
within
the
same
parish
,
a
greater
*NL*
waste
had
been
going
on
,
uncomplained
of
and
disregarded
.
A
few
*NL*
months
earlier
Boldwood
's
forgetting
his
husbandry
would
have
been
as
*NL*
preposterous
an
idea
as
a
sailor
forgetting
he
was
in
a
ship
.
Oak
*NL*
was
just
thinking
that
whatever
he
himself
might
have
suffered
from
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
marriage
,
here
was
a
man
who
had
suffered
more
,
when
*NL*
Boldwood
spoke
in
a
changed
voice
--
that
of
one
who
yearned
to
make
*NL*
a
confidence
and
relieve
his
heart
by
an
outpouring
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oak
,
you
know
as
well
as
I
that
things
have
gone
wrong
with
me
*NL*
lately
.
I
may
as
well
own
it
.
I
was
going
to
get
a
little
settled
*NL*
in
life
;
but
in
some
way
my
plan
has
come
to
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
my
mistress
would
have
married
you
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
not
*NL*
knowing
enough
of
the
full
depths
of
Boldwood
's
love
to
keep
silence
*NL*
on
the
farmer
's
account
,
and
determined
not
to
evade
discipline
by
*NL*
doing
so
on
his
own
.
``
However
,
it
is
so
sometimes
,
and
nothing
*NL*
happens
that
we
expect
,
''
he
added
,
with
the
repose
of
a
man
whom
*NL*
misfortune
had
inured
rather
than
subdued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
daresay
I
am
a
joke
about
the
parish
,
''
said
Boldwood
,
as
if
*NL*
the
subject
came
irresistibly
to
his
tongue
,
and
with
a
miserable
*NL*
lightness
meant
to
express
his
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
I
do
n't
think
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
But
the
real
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
there
was
not
,
as
some
*NL*
fancy
,
any
jilting
on
--
her
part
.
No
engagement
ever
existed
between
*NL*
me
and
Miss
Everdene
.
People
say
so
,
but
it
is
untrue
:
she
never
*NL*
promised
me
!
''
Boldwood
stood
still
now
and
turned
his
wild
face
to
*NL*
Oak
.
``
Oh
,
Gabriel
,
''
he
continued
,
``
I
am
weak
and
foolish
,
and
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
,
and
I
ca
n't
fend
off
my
miserable
grief
!
...
I
had
*NL*
some
faint
belief
in
the
mercy
of
God
till
I
lost
that
woman
.
Yes
,
*NL*
He
prepared
a
gourd
to
shade
me
,
and
like
the
prophet
I
thanked
Him
*NL*
and
was
glad
.
But
the
next
day
He
prepared
a
worm
to
smite
the
gourd
*NL*
and
wither
it
;
and
I
feel
it
is
better
to
die
than
to
live
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silence
followed
.
Boldwood
aroused
himself
from
the
momentary
*NL*
mood
of
confidence
into
which
he
had
drifted
,
and
walked
on
again
,
*NL*
resuming
his
usual
reserve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Gabriel
,
''
he
resumed
,
with
a
carelessness
which
was
like
*NL*
the
smile
on
the
countenance
of
a
skull
:
``
it
was
made
more
of
by
*NL*
other
people
than
ever
it
was
by
us
.
I
do
feel
a
little
regret
*NL*
occasionally
,
but
no
woman
ever
had
power
over
me
for
any
length
of
*NL*
time
.
Well
,
good
morning
;
I
can
trust
you
not
to
mention
to
others
*NL*
what
has
passed
between
us
two
here
.

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
COMING
HOME
--
A
CRY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
turnpike
road
,
between
Casterbridge
and
Weatherbury
,
and
about
*NL*
three
miles
from
the
former
place
,
is
Yalbury
Hill
,
one
of
those
*NL*
steep
long
ascents
which
pervade
the
highways
of
this
undulating
*NL*
part
of
South
Wessex
.
In
returning
from
market
it
is
usual
for
the
*NL*
farmers
and
other
gig-gentry
to
alight
at
the
bottom
and
walk
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
Saturday
evening
in
the
month
of
October
Bathsheba
's
vehicle
was
*NL*
duly
creeping
up
this
incline
.
She
was
sitting
listlessly
in
the
*NL*
second
seat
of
the
gig
,
whilst
walking
beside
her
in
a
farmer
's
*NL*
marketing
suit
of
unusually
fashionable
cut
was
an
erect
,
well-made
*NL*
young
man
.
Though
on
foot
,
he
held
the
reins
and
whip
,
and
*NL*
occasionally
aimed
light
cuts
at
the
horse
's
ear
with
the
end
of
the
*NL*
lash
,
as
a
recreation
.
This
man
was
her
husband
,
formerly
Sergeant
*NL*
Troy
,
who
,
having
bought
his
discharge
with
Bathsheba
's
money
,
was
*NL*
gradually
transforming
himself
into
a
farmer
of
a
spirited
and
very
*NL*
modern
school
.
People
of
unalterable
ideas
still
insisted
upon
*NL*
calling
him
``
Sergeant
''
when
they
met
him
,
which
was
in
some
degree
*NL*
owing
to
his
having
still
retained
the
well-shaped
moustache
of
his
*NL*
military
days
,
and
the
soldierly
bearing
inseparable
from
his
form
*NL*
and
training
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
that
wretched
rain
I
should
have
cleared
*NL*
two
hundred
as
easy
as
looking
,
my
love
,
''
he
was
saying
.
``
Do
n't
you
*NL*
see
,
it
altered
all
the
chances
?
To
speak
like
a
book
I
once
read
,
*NL*
wet
weather
is
the
narrative
,
and
fine
days
are
the
episodes
,
of
our
*NL*
country
's
history
;
now
,
is
n't
that
true
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
time
of
year
is
come
for
changeable
weather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yes
.
The
fact
is
,
these
autumn
races
are
the
ruin
of
*NL*
everybody
.
Never
did
I
see
such
a
day
as
't
was
!
'T
is
a
wild
open
*NL*
place
,
just
out
of
Budmouth
,
and
a
drab
sea
rolled
in
towards
us
like
*NL*
liquid
misery
.
Wind
and
rain
--
good
Lord
!
Dark
?
Why
,
't
was
as
black
*NL*
as
my
hat
before
the
last
race
was
run
.
'T
was
five
o'clock
,
and
*NL*
you
could
n't
see
the
horses
till
they
were
almost
in
,
leave
alone
*NL*
colours
.
The
ground
was
as
heavy
as
lead
,
and
all
judgment
from
a
*NL*
fellow
's
experience
went
for
nothing
.
Horses
,
riders
,
people
,
were
*NL*
all
blown
about
like
ships
at
sea
.
Three
booths
were
blown
over
,
*NL*
and
the
wretched
folk
inside
crawled
out
upon
their
hands
and
knees
;
*NL*
and
in
the
next
field
were
as
many
as
a
dozen
hats
at
one
time
.
Ay
,
*NL*
Pimpernel
regularly
stuck
fast
,
when
about
sixty
yards
off
,
and
when
*NL*
I
saw
Policy
stepping
on
,
it
did
knock
my
heart
against
the
lining
*NL*
of
my
ribs
,
I
assure
you
,
my
love
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
mean
,
Frank
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
sadly
--
her
voice
was
painfully
*NL*
lowered
from
the
fulness
and
vivacity
of
the
previous
summer
--
``
that
*NL*
you
have
lost
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
in
a
month
by
this
dreadful
*NL*
horse-racing
?
O
,
Frank
,
it
is
cruel
;
it
is
foolish
of
you
to
take
*NL*
away
my
money
so
.
We
shall
have
to
leave
the
farm
;
that
will
be
the
*NL*
end
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humbug
about
cruel
.
Now
,
there
't
is
again
--
turn
on
the
waterworks
;
*NL*
that
's
just
like
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
'll
promise
me
not
to
go
to
Budmouth
second
meeting
,
wo
n't
*NL*
you
?
''
she
implored
.
Bathsheba
was
at
the
full
depth
for
tears
,
but
*NL*
she
maintained
a
dry
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
;
in
fact
,
if
it
turns
out
to
be
a
fine
day
,
*NL*
I
was
thinking
of
taking
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
never
!
I
'll
go
a
hundred
miles
the
other
way
first
.
I
hate
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
very
word
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
question
of
going
to
see
the
race
or
staying
at
home
has
*NL*
very
little
to
do
with
the
matter
.
Bets
are
all
booked
safely
enough
*NL*
before
the
race
begins
,
you
may
depend
.
Whether
it
is
a
bad
race
for
*NL*
me
or
a
good
one
,
will
have
very
little
to
do
with
our
going
there
*NL*
next
Monday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
n't
mean
to
say
that
you
have
risked
anything
on
this
one
*NL*
too
!
''
she
exclaimed
,
with
an
agonized
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
now
,
do
n't
you
be
a
little
fool
.
Wait
till
you
are
told
.
*NL*
Why
,
Bathsheba
,
you
have
lost
all
the
pluck
and
sauciness
you
*NL*
formerly
had
,
and
upon
my
life
if
I
had
known
what
a
chicken-hearted
*NL*
creature
you
were
under
all
your
boldness
,
I
'd
never
have
--
I
know
*NL*
what
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
flash
of
indignation
might
have
been
seen
in
Bathsheba
's
dark
eyes
*NL*
as
she
looked
resolutely
ahead
after
this
reply
.
They
moved
on
*NL*
without
further
speech
,
some
early-withered
leaves
from
the
trees
*NL*
which
hooded
the
road
at
this
spot
occasionally
spinning
downward
*NL*
across
their
path
to
the
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
appeared
on
the
brow
of
the
hill
.
The
ridge
was
in
a
*NL*
cutting
,
so
that
she
was
very
near
the
husband
and
wife
before
she
*NL*
became
visible
.
Troy
had
turned
towards
the
gig
to
remount
,
and
*NL*
whilst
putting
his
foot
on
the
step
the
woman
passed
behind
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
overshadowing
trees
and
the
approach
of
eventide
enveloped
*NL*
them
in
gloom
,
Bathsheba
could
see
plainly
enough
to
discern
the
*NL*
extreme
poverty
of
the
woman
's
garb
,
and
the
sadness
of
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
,
sir
,
do
you
know
at
what
time
Casterbridge
Union-house
*NL*
closes
at
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
said
these
words
to
Troy
over
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
started
visibly
at
the
sound
of
the
voice
;
yet
he
seemed
to
*NL*
recover
presence
of
mind
sufficient
to
prevent
himself
from
giving
*NL*
way
to
his
impulse
to
suddenly
turn
and
face
her
.
He
said
,
slowly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
,
on
hearing
him
speak
,
quickly
looked
up
,
examined
the
side
*NL*
of
his
face
,
and
recognized
the
soldier
under
the
yeoman
's
garb
.
Her
*NL*
face
was
drawn
into
an
expression
which
had
gladness
and
agony
both
*NL*
among
its
elements
.
She
uttered
an
hysterical
cry
,
and
fell
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
poor
thing
!
''
exclaimed
Bathsheba
,
instantly
preparing
to
alight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stay
where
you
are
,
and
attend
to
the
horse
!
''
said
Troy
,
*NL*
peremptorily
throwing
her
the
reins
and
the
whip
.
``
Walk
the
horse
*NL*
to
the
top
:
I
'll
see
to
the
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
hear
?
Clk
--
Poppet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horse
,
gig
,
and
Bathsheba
moved
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
on
earth
did
you
come
here
?
I
thought
you
were
miles
away
,
or
*NL*
dead
!
Why
did
n't
you
write
to
me
?
''
said
Troy
to
the
woman
,
in
a
*NL*
strangely
gentle
,
yet
hurried
voice
,
as
he
lifted
her
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feared
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
any
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Heaven
--
I
wish
I
had
more
to
give
you

Here
's
--
wretched
--
the
*NL*
merest
trifle
.
It
is
every
farthing
I
have
left
.
I
have
none
but
*NL*
what
my
wife
gives
me
,
you
know
,
and
I
ca
n't
ask
her
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
made
no
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
only
another
moment
,
''
continued
Troy
;
``
and
now
listen
.
Where
*NL*
are
you
going
to-night
?
Casterbridge
Union
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
thought
to
go
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
sha
n't
go
there
;
yet

wait

Yes
,
perhaps
for
to-night
;
I
can
*NL*
do
nothing
better
--
worse
luck
!
Sleep
there
to-night
,
and
stay
there
*NL*
to-morrow
.
Monday
is
the
first
free
day
I
have
;
and
on
Monday
*NL*
morning
,
at
ten
exactly
,
meet
me
on
Grey
's
Bridge
just
out
of
the
*NL*
town
.
I
'll
bring
all
the
money
I
can
muster
.
You
sha
n't
want
--
I
'll
*NL*
see
that
,
Fanny
;
then
I
'll
get
you
a
lodging
somewhere
.
Good-bye
*NL*
till
then
.
I
am
a
brute
--
but
good-bye
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
advancing
the
distance
which
completed
the
ascent
of
the
*NL*
hill
,
Bathsheba
turned
her
head
.
The
woman
was
upon
her
feet
,
and
*NL*
Bathsheba
saw
her
withdrawing
from
Troy
,
and
going
feebly
down
the
*NL*
hill
by
the
third
milestone
from
Casterbridge
.
Troy
then
came
on
*NL*
towards
his
wife
,
stepped
into
the
gig
,
took
the
reins
from
her
hand
,
*NL*
and
without
making
any
observation
whipped
the
horse
into
a
trot
.
He
*NL*
was
rather
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
who
that
woman
was
?
''
said
Bathsheba
,
looking
searchingly
*NL*
into
his
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
he
said
,
looking
boldly
back
into
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
did
,
''
said
she
,
with
angry
hauteur
,
and
still
*NL*
regarding
him
.
``
Who
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
seemed
to
think
that
frankness
would
benefit
neither
of
*NL*
the
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
to
either
of
us
,
''
he
said
.
``
I
know
her
by
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
her
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
should
I
know

*NL*
*NL*
``

The

was
completed
by
a
smart
*NL*
cut
of
the
whip
round
Poppet
's
flank
,
which
caused
the
animal
to
*NL*
start
forward
at
a
wild
pace

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ON
CASTERBRIDGE
HIGHWAY
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
considerable
time
the
woman
walked
on
.
Her
steps
became
*NL*
feebler
,
and
she
strained
her
eyes
to
look
afar
upon
the
naked
road
,
*NL*
now
indistinct
amid
the
penumbrae
of
night
.
At
length
her
onward
walk
*NL*
dwindled
to
the
merest
totter
,
and
she
opened
a
gate
within
which
was
*NL*
a
haystack
.
Underneath
this
she
sat
down
and
presently
slept
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
woman
awoke
it
was
to
find
herself
in
the
depths
of
a
*NL*
moonless
and
starless
night
.
A
heavy
unbroken
crust
of
cloud
*NL*
stretched
across
the
sky
,
shutting
out
every
speck
of
heaven
;
and
a
*NL*
distant
halo
which
hung
over
the
town
of
Casterbridge
was
visible
*NL*
against
the
black
concave
,
the
luminosity
appearing
the
brighter
by
*NL*
its
great
contrast
with
the
circumscribing
darkness
.
Towards
this
*NL*
weak
,
soft
glow
the
woman
turned
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
could
only
get
there
!
''
she
said
.
``
Meet
him
the
day
after
*NL*
to-morrow
:
God
help
me
!
Perhaps
I
shall
be
in
my
grave
before
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
manor-house
clock
from
the
far
depths
of
shadow
struck
the
hour
,
*NL*
one
,
in
a
small
,
attenuated
tone
.
After
midnight
the
voice
of
a
*NL*
clock
seems
to
lose
in
breadth
as
much
as
in
length
,
and
to
diminish
*NL*
its
sonorousness
to
a
thin
falsetto
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterwards
a
light
--
two
lights
--
arose
from
the
remote
shade
,
and
grew
*NL*
larger
.
A
carriage
rolled
along
the
road
,
and
passed
the
gate
.
It
*NL*
probably
contained
some
late
diners-out
.
The
beams
from
one
lamp
*NL*
shone
for
a
moment
upon
the
crouching
woman
,
and
threw
her
face
into
*NL*
vivid
relief
.
The
face
was
young
in
the
groundwork
,
old
in
the
*NL*
finish
;
the
general
contours
were
flexuous
and
childlike
,
but
the
*NL*
finer
lineaments
had
begun
to
be
sharp
and
thin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pedestrian
stood
up
,
apparently
with
revived
determination
,
and
*NL*
looked
around
.
The
road
appeared
to
be
familiar
to
her
,
and
she
*NL*
carefully
scanned
the
fence
as
she
slowly
walked
along
.
Presently
*NL*
there
became
visible
a
dim
white
shape
;
it
was
another
milestone
.
*NL*
She
drew
her
fingers
across
its
face
to
feel
the
marks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
more
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
leant
against
the
stone
as
a
means
of
rest
for
a
short
interval
,
*NL*
then
bestirred
herself
,
and
again
pursued
her
way
.
For
a
slight
*NL*
distance
she
bore
up
bravely
,
afterwards
flagging
as
before
.
This
*NL*
was
beside
a
lone
copsewood
,
wherein
heaps
of
white
chips
strewn
upon
*NL*
the
leafy
ground
showed
that
woodmen
had
been
faggoting
and
making
*NL*
hurdles
during
the
day
.
Now
there
was
not
a
rustle
,
not
a
breeze
,
*NL*
not
the
faintest
clash
of
twigs
to
keep
her
company
.
The
woman
*NL*
looked
over
the
gate
,
opened
it
,
and
went
in
.
Close
to
the
entrance
*NL*
stood
a
row
of
faggots
,
bound
and
un-bound
,
together
with
stakes
of
*NL*
all
sizes
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
seconds
the
wayfarer
stood
with
that
tense
stillness
which
*NL*
signifies
itself
to
be
not
the
end
,
but
merely
the
suspension
,
of
*NL*
a
previous
motion
.
Her
attitude
was
that
of
a
person
who
listens
,
*NL*
either
to
the
external
world
of
sound
,
or
to
the
imagined
discourse
*NL*
of
thought
.
A
close
criticism
might
have
detected
signs
proving
that
*NL*
she
was
intent
on
the
latter
alternative
.
Moreover
,
as
was
shown
by
*NL*
what
followed
,
she
was
oddly
exercising
the
faculty
of
invention
upon
*NL*
the
speciality
of
the
clever
Jacquet
Droz
,
the
designer
of
automatic
*NL*
substitutes
for
human
limbs
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
aid
of
the
Casterbridge
aurora
,
and
by
feeling
with
her
hands
,
*NL*
the
woman
selected
two
sticks
from
the
heaps
.
These
sticks
were
*NL*
nearly
straight
to
the
height
of
three
or
four
feet
,
where
each
*NL*
branched
into
a
fork
like
the
letter
Y
.
She
sat
down
,
snapped
off
*NL*
the
small
upper
twigs
,
and
carried
the
remainder
with
her
into
the
*NL*
road
.
She
placed
one
of
these
forks
under
each
arm
as
a
crutch
,
*NL*
tested
them
,
timidly
threw
her
whole
weight
upon
them
--
so
little
that
*NL*
it
was
--
and
swung
herself
forward
.
The
girl
had
made
for
herself
a
*NL*
material
aid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crutches
answered
well
.
The
pat
of
her
feet
,
and
the
tap
of
*NL*
her
sticks
upon
the
highway
,
were
all
the
sounds
that
came
from
*NL*
the
traveller
now
.
She
had
passed
the
last
milestone
by
a
good
*NL*
long
distance
,
and
began
to
look
wistfully
towards
the
bank
as
if
*NL*
calculating
upon
another
milestone
soon
.
The
crutches
,
though
so
*NL*
very
useful
,
had
their
limits
of
power
.
Mechanism
only
transfers
*NL*
labour
,
being
powerless
to
supersede
it
,
and
the
original
amount
of
*NL*
exertion
was
not
cleared
away
;
it
was
thrown
into
the
body
and
arms
.
*NL*
She
was
exhausted
,
and
each
swing
forward
became
fainter
.
At
last
*NL*
she
swayed
sideways
,
and
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
she
lay
,
a
shapeless
heap
,
for
ten
minutes
and
more
.
The
*NL*
morning
wind
began
to
boom
dully
over
the
flats
,
and
to
move
afresh
*NL*
dead
leaves
which
had
lain
still
since
yesterday
.
The
woman
*NL*
desperately
turned
round
upon
her
knees
,
and
next
rose
to
her
feet
.
*NL*
Steadying
herself
by
the
help
of
one
crutch
,
she
essayed
a
step
,
then
*NL*
another
,
then
a
third
,
using
the
crutches
now
as
walking-sticks
only
.
*NL*
Thus
she
progressed
till
descending
Mellstock
Hill
another
milestone
*NL*
appeared
,
and
soon
the
beginning
of
an
iron-railed
fence
came
into
*NL*
view
.
She
staggered
across
to
the
first
post
,
clung
to
it
,
and
*NL*
looked
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Casterbridge
lights
were
now
individually
visible
.
It
was
getting
*NL*
towards
morning
,
and
vehicles
might
be
hoped
for
,
if
not
expected
*NL*
soon
.
She
listened
.
There
was
not
a
sound
of
life
save
that
acme
*NL*
and
sublimation
of
all
dismal
sounds
,
the
bark
of
a
fox
,
its
three
*NL*
hollow
notes
being
rendered
at
intervals
of
a
minute
with
the
*NL*
precision
of
a
funeral
bell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Less
than
a
mile
!
''
the
woman
murmured
.
``
No
;
more
,
''
she
added
,
after
*NL*
a
pause
.
``
The
mile
is
to
the
county
hall
,
and
my
resting-place
is
on
*NL*
the
other
side
Casterbridge
.
A
little
over
a
mile
,
and
there
I
am
!
''
*NL*
After
an
interval
she
again
spoke
.
``
Five
or
six
steps
to
a
yard
--
six
*NL*
perhaps
.
I
have
to
go
seventeen
hundred
yards
.
A
hundred
times
six
,
*NL*
six
hundred
.
Seventeen
times
that
.
O
pity
me
,
Lord
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Holding
to
the
rails
,
she
advanced
,
thrusting
one
hand
forward
upon
*NL*
the
rail
,
then
the
other
,
then
leaning
over
it
whilst
she
dragged
her
*NL*
feet
on
beneath
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
woman
was
not
given
to
soliloquy
;
but
extremity
of
feeling
*NL*
lessens
the
individuality
of
the
weak
,
as
it
increases
that
of
the
*NL*
strong
.
She
said
again
in
the
same
tone
,
``
I
'll
believe
that
the
end
*NL*
lies
five
posts
forward
,
and
no
further
,
and
so
get
strength
to
pass
*NL*
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
practical
application
of
the
principle
that
a
half-feigned
*NL*
and
fictitious
faith
is
better
than
no
faith
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
five
posts
and
held
on
to
the
fifth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
pass
five
more
by
believing
my
longed-for
spot
is
at
the
next
*NL*
fifth
.
I
can
do
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
five
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
lies
only
five
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
five
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
five
further
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
stone
bridge
is
the
end
of
my
journey
,
''
she
said
,
when
the
*NL*
bridge
over
the
Froom
was
in
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
crawled
to
the
bridge
.
During
the
effort
each
breath
of
the
*NL*
woman
went
into
the
air
as
if
never
to
return
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
for
the
truth
of
the
matter
,
''
she
said
,
sitting
down
.
``
The
*NL*
truth
is
,
that
I
have
less
than
half
a
mile
.
''
Self-beguilement
with
*NL*
what
she
had
known
all
the
time
to
be
false
had
given
her
strength
to
*NL*
come
over
half
a
mile
that
she
would
have
been
powerless
to
face
in
*NL*
the
lump
.
The
artifice
showed
that
the
woman
,
by
some
mysterious
*NL*
intuition
,
had
grasped
the
paradoxical
truth
that
blindness
may
*NL*
operate
more
vigorously
than
prescience
,
and
the
short-sighted
effect
*NL*
more
than
the
far-seeing
;
that
limitation
,
and
not
comprehensiveness
,
*NL*
is
needed
for
striking
a
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
half-mile
stood
now
before
the
sick
and
weary
woman
like
a
stolid
*NL*
Juggernaut
.
It
was
an
impassive
King
of
her
world
.
The
road
here
*NL*
ran
across
Durnover
Moor
,
open
to
the
road
on
either
side
.
She
*NL*
surveyed
the
wide
space
,
the
lights
,
herself
,
sighed
,
and
lay
down
*NL*
against
a
guard-stone
of
the
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
was
ingenuity
exercised
so
sorely
as
the
traveller
here
*NL*
exercised
hers
.
Every
conceivable
aid
,
method
,
stratagem
,
mechanism
,
*NL*
by
which
these
last
desperate
eight
hundred
yards
could
be
overpassed
*NL*
by
a
human
being
unperceived
,
was
revolved
in
her
busy
brain
,
*NL*
and
dismissed
as
impracticable
.
She
thought
of
sticks
,
wheels
,
*NL*
crawling
--
she
even
thought
of
rolling
.
But
the
exertion
demanded
*NL*
by
either
of
these
latter
two
was
greater
than
to
walk
erect
.
The
*NL*
faculty
of
contrivance
was
worn
out
.
Hopelessness
had
come
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
further
!
''
she
whispered
,
and
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
stripe
of
shadow
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
bridge
a
*NL*
portion
of
shade
seemed
to
detach
itself
and
move
into
isolation
*NL*
upon
the
pale
white
of
the
road
.
It
glided
noiselessly
towards
the
*NL*
recumbent
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
became
conscious
of
something
touching
her
hand
;
it
was
softness
*NL*
and
it
was
warmth
.
She
opened
her
eyes
,
and
the
substance
touched
*NL*
her
face
.
A
dog
was
licking
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
huge
,
heavy
,
and
quiet
creature
,
standing
darkly
against
the
*NL*
low
horizon
,
and
at
least
two
feet
higher
than
the
present
position
*NL*
of
her
eyes
.
Whether
Newfoundland
,
mastiff
,
bloodhound
,
or
what
*NL*
not
,
it
was
impossible
to
say
.
He
seemed
to
be
of
too
strange
and
*NL*
mysterious
a
nature
to
belong
to
any
variety
among
those
of
popular
*NL*
nomenclature
.
Being
thus
assignable
to
no
breed
,
he
was
the
ideal
*NL*
embodiment
of
canine
greatness
--
a
generalization
from
what
was
common
*NL*
to
all
.
Night
,
in
its
sad
,
solemn
,
and
benevolent
aspect
,
apart
from
*NL*
its
stealthy
and
cruel
side
,
was
personified
in
this
form
.
Darkness
*NL*
endows
the
small
and
ordinary
ones
among
mankind
with
poetical
power
,
*NL*
and
even
the
suffering
woman
threw
her
idea
into
figure
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
reclining
position
she
looked
up
to
him
just
as
in
earlier
*NL*
times
she
had
,
when
standing
,
looked
up
to
a
man
.
The
animal
,
who
*NL*
was
as
homeless
as
she
,
respectfully
withdrew
a
step
or
two
when
the
*NL*
woman
moved
,
and
,
seeing
that
she
did
not
repulse
him
,
he
licked
her
*NL*
hand
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thought
moved
within
her
like
lightning
.
``
Perhaps
I
can
make
use
*NL*
of
him
--
I
might
do
it
then
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pointed
in
the
direction
of
Casterbridge
,
and
the
dog
seemed
to
*NL*
misunderstand
:
he
trotted
on
.
Then
,
finding
she
could
not
follow
,
he
*NL*
came
back
and
whined
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ultimate
and
saddest
singularity
of
woman
's
effort
and
invention
*NL*
was
reached
when
,
with
a
quickened
breathing
,
she
rose
to
a
stooping
*NL*
posture
,
and
,
resting
her
two
little
arms
upon
the
shoulders
of
the
*NL*
dog
,
leant
firmly
thereon
,
and
murmured
stimulating
words
.
Whilst
*NL*
she
sorrowed
in
her
heart
she
cheered
with
her
voice
,
and
what
was
*NL*
stranger
than
that
the
strong
should
need
encouragement
from
the
weak
*NL*
was
that
cheerfulness
should
be
so
well
stimulated
by
such
utter
*NL*
dejection
.
Her
friend
moved
forward
slowly
,
and
she
with
small
*NL*
mincing
steps
moved
forward
beside
him
,
half
her
weight
being
thrown
*NL*
upon
the
animal
.
Sometimes
she
sank
as
she
had
sunk
from
walking
*NL*
erect
,
from
the
crutches
,
from
the
rails
.
The
dog
,
who
now
*NL*
thoroughly
understood
her
desire
and
her
incapacity
,
was
frantic
in
*NL*
his
distress
on
these
occasions
;
he
would
tug
at
her
dress
and
run
*NL*
forward
.
She
always
called
him
back
,
and
it
was
now
to
be
observed
*NL*
that
the
woman
listened
for
human
sounds
only
to
avoid
them
.
It
was
*NL*
evident
that
she
had
an
object
in
keeping
her
presence
on
the
road
*NL*
and
her
forlorn
state
unknown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
progress
was
necessarily
very
slow
.
They
reached
the
bottom
*NL*
of
the
town
,
and
the
Casterbridge
lamps
lay
before
them
like
fallen
*NL*
Pleiads
as
they
turned
to
the
left
into
the
dense
shade
of
a
deserted
*NL*
avenue
of
chestnuts
,
and
so
skirted
the
borough
.
Thus
the
town
was
*NL*
passed
,
and
the
goal
was
reached
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
much-desired
spot
outside
the
town
rose
a
picturesque
*NL*
building
.
Originally
it
had
been
a
mere
case
to
hold
people
.
The
*NL*
shell
had
been
so
thin
,
so
devoid
of
excrescence
,
and
so
closely
*NL*
drawn
over
the
accommodation
granted
,
that
the
grim
character
of
what
*NL*
was
beneath
showed
through
it
,
as
the
shape
of
a
body
is
visible
*NL*
under
a
winding-sheet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Nature
,
as
if
offended
,
lent
a
hand
.
Masses
of
ivy
grew
up
,
*NL*
completely
covering
the
walls
,
till
the
place
looked
like
an
abbey
;
*NL*
and
it
was
discovered
that
the
view
from
the
front
,
over
the
*NL*
Casterbridge
chimneys
,
was
one
of
the
most
magnificent
in
the
*NL*
county
.
A
neighbouring
earl
once
said
that
he
would
give
up
a
year
's
*NL*
rental
to
have
at
his
own
door
the
view
enjoyed
by
the
inmates
from
*NL*
theirs
--
and
very
probably
the
inmates
would
have
given
up
the
view
*NL*
for
his
year
's
rental
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
stone
edifice
consisted
of
a
central
mass
and
two
wings
,
whereon
*NL*
stood
as
sentinels
a
few
slim
chimneys
,
now
gurgling
sorrowfully
to
*NL*
the
slow
wind
.
In
the
wall
was
a
gate
,
and
by
the
gate
a
bellpull
*NL*
formed
of
a
hanging
wire
.
The
woman
raised
herself
as
high
as
*NL*
possible
upon
her
knees
,
and
could
just
reach
the
handle
.
She
moved
*NL*
it
and
fell
forwards
in
a
bowed
attitude
,
her
face
upon
her
bosom
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
getting
on
towards
six
o'clock
,
and
sounds
of
movement
were
*NL*
to
be
heard
inside
the
building
which
was
the
haven
of
rest
to
this
*NL*
wearied
soul
.
A
little
door
by
the
large
one
was
opened
,
and
a
man
*NL*
appeared
inside
.
He
discerned
the
panting
heap
of
clothes
,
went
back
*NL*
for
a
light
,
and
came
again
.
He
entered
a
second
time
,
and
returned
*NL*
with
two
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
lifted
the
prostrate
figure
and
assisted
her
in
through
the
*NL*
doorway
.
The
man
then
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
did
she
get
here
?
''
said
one
of
the
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Lord
knows
,
''
said
the
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
dog
outside
,
''
murmured
the
overcome
traveller
.
``
Where
is
*NL*
he
gone
?
He
helped
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
stoned
him
away
,
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
procession
then
moved
forward
--
the
man
in
front
bearing
*NL*
the
light
,
the
two
bony
women
next
,
supporting
between
them
the
small
*NL*
and
supple
one
.
Thus
they
entered
the
house
and
disappeared
.

CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
SUSPICION
--
FANNY
IS
SENT
FOR
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
said
very
little
to
her
husband
all
that
evening
of
their
*NL*
return
from
market
,
and
he
was
not
disposed
to
say
much
to
her
.
He
*NL*
exhibited
the
unpleasant
combination
of
a
restless
condition
with
a
*NL*
silent
tongue
.
The
next
day
,
which
was
Sunday
,
passed
nearly
in
the
*NL*
same
manner
as
regarded
their
taciturnity
,
Bathsheba
going
to
church
*NL*
both
morning
and
afternoon
.
This
was
the
day
before
the
Budmouth
*NL*
races
.
In
the
evening
Troy
said
,
suddenly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bathsheba
,
could
you
let
me
have
twenty
pounds
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
countenance
instantly
sank
.
``
Twenty
pounds
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fact
is
,
I
want
it
badly
.
''
The
anxiety
upon
Troy
's
face
was
*NL*
unusual
and
very
marked
.
It
was
a
culmination
of
the
mood
he
had
*NL*
been
in
all
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
for
those
races
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
for
the
moment
made
no
reply
.
Her
mistake
had
its
advantages
*NL*
to
a
man
who
shrank
from
having
his
mind
inspected
as
he
did
now
.
*NL*
``
Well
,
suppose
I
do
want
it
for
races
?
''
he
said
,
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Frank
!
''
Bathsheba
replied
,
and
there
was
such
a
volume
of
*NL*
entreaty
in
the
words
.
``
Only
such
a
few
weeks
ago
you
said
that
I
*NL*
was
far
sweeter
than
all
your
other
pleasures
put
together
,
and
that
*NL*
you
would
give
them
all
up
for
me
;
and
now
,
wo
n't
you
give
up
this
*NL*
one
,
which
is
more
a
worry
than
a
pleasure
?
Do
,
Frank
.
Come
,
let
*NL*
me
fascinate
you
by
all
I
can
do
--
by
pretty
words
and
pretty
looks
,
*NL*
and
everything
I
can
think
of
--
to
stay
at
home
.
Say
yes
to
your
*NL*
wife
--
say
yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
tenderest
and
softest
phases
of
Bathsheba
's
nature
were
prominent
*NL*
now
--
advanced
impulsively
for
his
acceptance
,
without
any
of
the
*NL*
disguises
and
defences
which
the
wariness
of
her
character
when
she
*NL*
was
cool
too
frequently
threw
over
them
.
Few
men
could
have
resisted
*NL*
the
arch
yet
dignified
entreaty
of
the
beautiful
face
,
thrown
a
*NL*
little
back
and
sideways
in
the
well
known
attitude
that
expresses
*NL*
more
than
the
words
it
accompanies
,
and
which
seems
to
have
been
*NL*
designed
for
these
special
occasions
.
Had
the
woman
not
been
his
*NL*
wife
,
Troy
would
have
succumbed
instantly
;
as
it
was
,
he
thought
he
*NL*
would
not
deceive
her
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
money
is
not
wanted
for
racing
debts
at
all
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
for
?
''
she
asked
.
``
You
worry
me
a
great
deal
by
these
*NL*
mysterious
responsibilities
,
Frank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
hesitated
.
He
did
not
now
love
her
enough
to
allow
himself
*NL*
to
be
carried
too
far
by
her
ways
.
Yet
it
was
necessary
to
be
*NL*
civil
.
``
You
wrong
me
by
such
a
suspicious
manner
,
''
he
said
.
``
Such
*NL*
strait-waistcoating
as
you
treat
me
to
is
not
becoming
in
you
at
so
*NL*
early
a
date
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
that
I
have
a
right
to
grumble
a
little
if
I
pay
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
with
features
between
a
smile
and
a
pout
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Exactly
;
and
,
the
former
being
done
,
suppose
we
proceed
to
the
*NL*
latter
.
Bathsheba
,
fun
is
all
very
well
,
but
do
n't
go
too
far
,
or
*NL*
you
may
have
cause
to
regret
something
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reddened
.
``
I
do
that
already
,
''
she
said
,
quickly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
regret
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
my
romance
has
come
to
an
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
romances
end
at
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
would
n't
talk
like
that
.
You
grieve
me
to
my
soul
by
*NL*
being
smart
at
my
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
dull
enough
at
mine
.
I
believe
you
hate
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
you
--
only
your
faults
.
I
do
hate
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
`
Twould
be
much
more
becoming
if
you
set
yourself
to
cure
them
.
*NL*
Come
,
let
's
strike
a
balance
with
the
twenty
pounds
,
and
be
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
a
sigh
of
resignation
.
``
I
have
about
that
sum
here
for
*NL*
household
expenses
.
If
you
must
have
it
,
take
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
good
.
Thank
you
.
I
expect
I
shall
have
gone
away
before
you
*NL*
are
in
to
breakfast
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
must
you
go
?
Ah
!
there
was
a
time
,
Frank
,
when
it
would
have
*NL*
taken
a
good
many
promises
to
other
people
to
drag
you
away
from
me
.
*NL*
You
used
to
call
me
darling
,
then
.
But
it
does
n't
matter
to
you
how
*NL*
my
days
are
passed
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
,
in
spite
of
sentiment
.
''
Troy
,
as
he
spoke
,
looked
at
his
*NL*
watch
,
and
,
apparently
actuated
by
_
non
lucendo
_
principles
,
opened
*NL*
the
case
at
the
back
,
revealing
,
snugly
stowed
within
it
,
a
small
*NL*
coil
of
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
eyes
had
been
accidentally
lifted
at
that
moment
,
and
she
*NL*
saw
the
action
and
saw
the
hair
.
She
flushed
in
pain
and
surprise
,
*NL*
and
some
words
escaped
her
before
she
had
thought
whether
or
not
it
*NL*
was
wise
to
utter
them
.
``
A
woman
's
curl
of
hair
!
''
she
said
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Frank
,
whose
is
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
had
instantly
closed
his
watch
.
He
carelessly
replied
,
as
one
*NL*
who
cloaked
some
feelings
that
the
sight
had
stirred
.
``
Why
,
yours
,
*NL*
of
course
.
Whose
should
it
be
?
I
had
quite
forgotten
that
I
had
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
dreadful
fib
,
Frank
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
tell
you
I
had
forgotten
it
!
''
he
said
,
loudly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
mean
that
--
it
was
yellow
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nonsense

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
insulting
me

I
know

Now

I
*NL*
want

know

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

I
'll
tell
you

so
make
no
more
ado

It

the
hair

young
woman
I
was
going
to
marry
before
I
knew
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

*NL*
``
Affliction

he
inquired

quickly

*NL*

``

dreadful
colour

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

said
Troy
,
recovering
himself
.
``
Why

has
been
admired

seen
her

worn

loose
,
which
has
not
been
long

It

beautiful
hair

to
turn

*NL*
*NL*
``
Pooh

she
exclaimed
,
in
incipient

accents
of
pique
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Bathsheba

fitful

You

life
would
be
like

should
n't
have
entered
it
if
you
feared
these
*NL*
contingencies

''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
had
by
this
time
driven
her
to
bitterness
:
her
heart
was
big
in
*NL*
her
throat
,
and
the
ducts
to
her
eyes
were
painfully
full
.
Ashamed
*NL*
as
she
was
to
show
emotion
,
at
last
she
burst
out
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
all
I
get
for

so
well

Ah

dearer

say
that
I

now

you
sneer
at
my
foolishness
in
marrying
you

O

is
it
kind
to
me
to
*NL*
throw
my
mistake
in
my
face

Whatever
opinion
you
may
have
of
my

wisdom

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
Frank
went
on

*NL*
*NL*
Trembling
now
,
she
put
her
hand
upon
his

saying
,
in
mingled

tones
of
wretchedness
and
coaxing
,

we
met
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
was
the
meeting
with
her
that
reminded
me
of
the
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
hers
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
There
,
now
that
you
have
wormed
it
out
of
me
,
I
hope
you
are
*NL*
content
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
are
the
ties
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
that
meant
nothing
--
a
mere
jest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
mere
jest
!
''
she
said
,
in
mournful
astonishment
.
``
Can
you
jest
*NL*
when
I
am
so
wretchedly
in
earnest
?
Tell
me
the
truth
,
Frank
.
I
*NL*
am
not
a
fool
,
you
know
,
although
I
am
a
woman
,
and
have
my
woman
's
*NL*
moments
.
Come
!
treat
me
fairly
,
''
she
said
,
looking
honestly
and
*NL*
fearlessly
into
his
face
.
``
I
do
n't
want
much
;
bare
justice
--
that
's
*NL*
all
!
Ah
!
once
I
felt
I
could
be
content
with
nothing
less
than
the
*NL*
highest
homage
from
the
husband
I
should
choose
.
Now
,
anything
*NL*
short
of
cruelty
will
content
me
.
Yes
!
the
independent
and
spirited
*NL*
Bathsheba
is
come
to
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
Heaven
's
sake
do
n't
be
so
desperate
!
''
Troy
said
,
snappishly
,
*NL*
rising
as
he
did
so
,
and
leaving
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Directly
he
had
gone
,
Bathsheba
burst
into
great
sobs
--
dry-eyed
sobs
,
*NL*
which
cut
as
they
came
,
without
any
softening
by
tears
.
But
she
*NL*
determined
to
repress
all
evidences
of
feeling
.
She
was
conquered
;
*NL*
but
she
would
never
own
it
as
long
as
she
lived
.
Her
pride
was
*NL*
indeed
brought
low
by
despairing
discoveries
of
her
spoliation
by
*NL*
marriage
with
a
less
pure
nature
than
her
own
.
She
chafed
to
and
fro
*NL*
in
rebelliousness
,
like
a
caged
leopard
;
her
whole
soul
was
in
arms
,
*NL*
and
the
blood
fired
her
face
.
Until
she
had
met
Troy
,
Bathsheba
had
*NL*
been
proud
of
her
position
as
a
woman
;
it
had
been
a
glory
to
her
to
*NL*
know
that
her
lips
had
been
touched
by
no
man
's
on
earth
--
that
her
*NL*
waist
had
never
been
encircled
by
a
lover
's
arm
.
She
hated
herself
*NL*
now
.
In
those
earlier
days
she
had
always
nourished
a
secret
*NL*
contempt
for
girls
who
were
the
slaves
of
the
first
good-looking
*NL*
young
fellow
who
should
choose
to
salute
them
.
She
had
never
taken
*NL*
kindly
to
the
idea
of
marriage
in
the
abstract
as
did
the
majority
of
*NL*
women
she
saw
about
her
.
In
the
turmoil
of
her
anxiety
for
her
lover
*NL*
she
had
agreed
to
marry
him
;
but
the
perception
that
had
accompanied
*NL*
her
happiest
hours
on
this
account
was
rather
that
of
self-sacrifice
*NL*
than
of
promotion
and
honour
.
Although
she
scarcely
knew
the
*NL*
divinity
's
name
,
Diana
was
the
goddess
whom
Bathsheba
instinctively
*NL*
adored
.
That
she
had
never
,
by
look
,
word
,
or
sign
,
encouraged
a
man
*NL*
to
approach
her
--
that
she
had
felt
herself
sufficient
to
herself
,
*NL*
and
had
in
the
independence
of
her
girlish
heart
fancied
there
was
*NL*
a
certain
degradation
in
renouncing
the
simplicity
of
a
maiden
*NL*
existence
to
become
the
humbler
half
of
an
indifferent
matrimonial
*NL*
whole
--
were
facts
now
bitterly
remembered
.
Oh
,
if
she
had
never
*NL*
stooped
to
folly
of
this
kind
,
respectable
as
it
was
,
and
could
only
*NL*
stand
again
,
as
she
had
stood
on
the
hill
at
Norcombe
,
and
dare
Troy
*NL*
or
any
other
man
to
pollute
a
hair
of
her
head
by
his
interference
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
she
rose
earlier
than
usual
,
and
had
the
horse
*NL*
saddled
for
her
ride
round
the
farm
in
the
customary
way
.
When
she
*NL*
came
in
at
half-past
eight
--
their
usual
hour
for
breakfasting
--
she
*NL*
was
informed
that
her
husband
had
risen
,
taken
his
breakfast
,
and
*NL*
driven
off
to
Casterbridge
with
the
gig
and
Poppet
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
breakfast
she
was
cool
and
collected
--
quite
herself
in
*NL*
fact
--
and
she
rambled
to
the
gate
,
intending
to
walk
to
another
*NL*
quarter
of
the
farm
,
which
she
still
personally
superintended
as
*NL*
well
as
her
duties
in
the
house
would
permit
,
continually
,
however
,
*NL*
finding
herself
preceded
in
forethought
by
Gabriel
Oak
,
for
whom
she
*NL*
began
to
entertain
the
genuine
friendship
of
a
sister
.
Of
course
,
*NL*
she
sometimes
thought
of
him
in
the
light
of
an
old
lover
,
and
had
*NL*
momentary
imaginings
of
what
life
with
him
as
a
husband
would
have
*NL*
been
like
;
also
of
life
with
Boldwood
under
the
same
conditions
.
*NL*
But
Bathsheba
,
though
she
could
feel
,
was
not
much
given
to
futile
*NL*
dreaming
,
and
her
musings
under
this
head
were
short
and
entirely
*NL*
confined
to
the
times
when
Troy
's
neglect
was
more
than
ordinarily
*NL*
evident
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
coming
up
the
road
a
man
like
Mr.
Boldwood
.
It
was
Mr.
*NL*
Boldwood
.
Bathsheba
blushed
painfully
,
and
watched
.
The
farmer
*NL*
stopped
when
still
a
long
way
off
,
and
held
up
his
hand
to
Gabriel
*NL*
Oak
,
who
was
in
a
footpath
across
the
field
.
The
two
men
then
*NL*
approached
each
other
and
seemed
to
engage
in
earnest
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
they
continued
for
a
long
time
.
Joseph
Poorgrass
now
passed
*NL*
near
them
,
wheeling
a
barrow
of
apples
up
the
hill
to
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
residence
.
Boldwood
and
Gabriel
called
to
him
,
spoke
to
him
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
and
then
all
three
parted
,
Joseph
immediately
coming
*NL*
up
the
hill
with
his
barrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
who
had
seen
this
pantomime
with
some
surprise
,
*NL*
experienced
great
relief
when
Boldwood
turned
back
again
.
``
Well
,
*NL*
what
's
the
message
,
Joseph
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
set
down
his
barrow
,
and
,
putting
upon
himself
the
refined
aspect
*NL*
that
a
conversation
with
a
lady
required
,
spoke
to
Bathsheba
over
the
*NL*
gate
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
never
see
Fanny
Robin
no
more
--
use
nor
principal

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

''
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*

What

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
for
certain
;
but
I
should
be
inclined
to
think
it
was
*NL*
from
general
neshness
of
constitution
.
She
was
such
a
limber
maid
*NL*
that
'
a
could
stand
no
hardship
,
even
when
I
knowed
her
,
and
'
a
went
*NL*
like
a
candle-snoff
,
so
't
is
said
.
She
was
took
bad
in
the
morning
,
*NL*
and
,
being
quite
feeble
and
worn
out
,
she
died
in
the
evening
.
She
*NL*
belongs
by
law
to
our
parish
;
and
Mr.
Boldwood
is
going
to
send
a
*NL*
waggon
at
three
this
afternoon
to
fetch
her
home
here
and
bury
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
shall
not
let
Mr.
Boldwood
do
any
such
thing

I
shall
do

it

my
uncle

servant

and
,
although
I
only
knew
her
*NL*
for
a
couple
of
days

she

very
,
very
sad
this
*NL*
is
!

the
idea
of
Fanny
being
in
a
workhouse

Bathsheba
had
begun
to
*NL*
know
what
suffering
was
,
and
she
spoke
with
real
feeling
...
``
Send
*NL*
across

No

changed
the

in

long-drawn

Did

*NL*
She
turned
herself
away
from
him
,
that
he
might
no
longer
notice
the
*NL*
mood
which
had
set
its
sign
so
visibly
upon
her
,
and
went
indoors
*NL*
with
a
distressing
sense
of
faintness
and
a
beating
brow
.
About
an
*NL*
hour
after
,
she
heard
the
noise
of
the
waggon
and
went
out
,
still
*NL*
with
a
painful
consciousness
of
her
bewildered
and
troubled
look
.
*NL*
Joseph
,
dressed
in
his
best
suit
of
clothes
,
was
putting
in
the
horse
*NL*
to
start
.
The
shrubs
and
flowers
were
all
piled
in
the
waggon
,
as
*NL*
she
had
directed
;
Bathsheba
hardly
saw
them
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Died
of
what

did
you
say

Joseph

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

``
Sure

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
that
all
I
know
is
that
she
arrived
in
the
morning
and
died
*NL*
in
the
evening
without
further
parley
.
What
Oak
and
Mr.
Boldwood
*NL*
told
me
was
only
these
few
words
.
`
Little
Fanny
Robin
is
dead

*NL*
Joseph

Gabriel
said
,
looking
in
my
face
in
his
steady
old
way
.
*NL*
I
was
very
sorry
,
and
I
said
,
`
Ah
!

how
did
she
come
to
die

'
*NL*
`
Well
,
she
's
dead
in

'
he
said
,
`
and
perhaps
*NL*
't
is
n't
much
matter
about
how
she
came
to
die
.
She
reached
the
*NL*
Union
early
Sunday
morning
,
and
died
in
the
afternoon
--
that
's
clear
*NL*
enough
.

Then
I
asked
what
she
'd
been
doing
lately
,
and
Mr.
Boldwood
*NL*
turned
round
to
me
then
,
and
left
off
spitting
a
thistle
with
the
end
*NL*
of
his
stick
.
He
told
me
about
her
having
lived
by
seampstering
in
*NL*
Melchester
,
as
I
mentioned
to
you
,
and
that
she
walked
therefrom
at
*NL*
the
end
of
last
week
,
passing
near
here
Saturday
night
in
the
dusk
.
*NL*
They
then
said
I
had
better
just
name
a
hint
of
her
death
to
you
,
and
*NL*
away
they
went
.
Her
death
might
have
been
brought
on
by
biding
in
*NL*
the
night
wind
,
you
know
,
ma'am
;
for
people
used
to
say
she
'd
go
off
*NL*
in
a
decline
:
she
used
to
cough
a
good
deal
in
winter
time
.
However
,
*NL*
't
is
n't
much
odds
to
us
about
that
now
,
for
't
is
all
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
heard
a
different
story
at
all
?
''
She
looked
at
him
so
*NL*
intently
that
Joseph
's
eyes
quailed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
,
mistress
,
I
assure
`
ee
!
''
he
said
.
``
Hardly
anybody
in
*NL*
the
parish
knows
the
news
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
why
Gabriel
did
n't
bring
the
message
to
me
himself
.
He
*NL*
mostly
makes
a
point
of
seeing
me
upon
the
most
trifling
errand
.
''
*NL*
These
words
were
merely
murmured
,
and
she
was
looking
upon
the
*NL*
ground
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
was
busy
,
ma'am
,
''
Joseph
suggested
.
``
And
sometimes
he
*NL*
seems
to
suffer
from
things
upon
his
mind
,
connected
with
the
time
*NL*
when
he
was
better
off
than
'
a
is
now
.
`
A
's
rather
a
curious
item
,
*NL*
but
a
very
understanding
shepherd
,
and
learned
in
books
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
anything
seem
upon
his
mind
whilst
he
was
speaking
to
you
about
*NL*
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
but
say
that
there
did
,
ma'am
.
He
was
terrible
down
,
and
*NL*
so
was
Farmer
Boldwood
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Joseph
.
That
will
do
.
Go
on
now
,
or
you
'll
be
late

''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
still
unhappy
,
went
indoors
again
.
In
the
course
of
the
*NL*
afternoon
she
said
to
Liddy
,
who
had
been
informed
of
the
occurrence
,
*NL*
``
What
was
the
colour
of
poor
Fanny
Robin
's
hair
?
Do
you
know
?
I
*NL*
can
not
recollect
--
I
only
saw
her
for
a
day
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
light
,
ma'am
;
but
she
wore
it
rather
short
,
and
packed
away
*NL*
under
her
cap
,
so
that
you
would
hardly
notice
it
.
But
I
have
seen
*NL*
her
let
it
down
when
she
was
going
to
bed
,
and
it
looked
beautiful
*NL*
then
.
Real
golden
hair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
young
man
was
a
soldier
,
was
he
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
In
the
same
regiment
as
Mr.
Troy

He
says
he
knew
him
very
*NL*
well

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
,
Mr.
Troy
says
so
?
How
came
he
to
say
that
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
One
day
I
just
named
it
to
him
,
and
asked
him
if
he
knew
Fanny

young
man
.
He
said
,
`
Oh
yes

he
knew
the
young
man
as
well
as
he
*NL*
knew
himself
,
and
that
there
was

a
man
in
the
regiment

liked
*NL*
better

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
Said
that

did
he
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

he
said
there
was
a
strong

that
sometimes
people
mistook
them

*NL*
``

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
JOSEPH
AND
HIS
BURDEN
--
BUCK
'S
HEAD
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
wall
bounded
the
site
of
Casterbridge
Union-house
,
except
along
a
*NL*
portion
of
the
end
.
Here
a
high
gable
stood
prominent
,
and
it
was
*NL*
covered
like
the
front
with
a
mat
of
ivy
.
In
this
gable
was
no
*NL*
window
,
chimney
,
ornament
,
or
protuberance
of
any
kind
.
The
single
*NL*
feature
appertaining
to
it
,
beyond
the
expanse
of
dark
green
leaves
,
*NL*
was
a
small
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
the
door
was
peculiar
.
The
sill
was
three
or
four
*NL*
feet
above
the
ground
,
and
for
a
moment
one
was
at
a
loss
for
an
*NL*
explanation
of
this
exceptional
altitude
,
till
ruts
immediately
*NL*
beneath
suggested
that
the
door
was
used
solely
for
the
passage
of
*NL*
articles
and
persons
to
and
from
the
level
of
a
vehicle
standing
on
*NL*
the
outside
.
Upon
the
whole
,
the
door
seemed
to
advertise
itself
as
*NL*
a
species
of
Traitor
's
Gate
translated
to
another
sphere
.
That
entry
*NL*
and
exit
hereby
was
only
at
rare
intervals
became
apparent
on
noting
*NL*
that
tufts
of
grass
were
allowed
to
flourish
undisturbed
in
the
*NL*
chinks
of
the
sill
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
clock
over
the
South-street
Alms-house
pointed
to
five
minutes
*NL*
to
three
,
a
blue
spring
waggon
,
picked
out
with
red
,
and
containing
*NL*
boughs
and
flowers
,
passed
the
end
of
the
street
,
and
up
towards
this
*NL*
side
of
the
building
.
Whilst
the
chimes
were
yet
stammering
out
a
*NL*
shattered
form
of
``
Malbrook
,
''
Joseph
Poorgrass
rang
the
bell
,
and
*NL*
received
directions
to
back
his
waggon
against
the
high
door
under
*NL*
the
gable
.
The
door
then
opened
,
and
a
plain
elm
coffin
was
slowly
*NL*
thrust
forth
,
and
laid
by
two
men
in
fustian
along
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
vehicle
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
men
then
stepped
up
beside
it
,
took
from
his
pocket
a
lump
*NL*
of
chalk
,
and
wrote
upon
the
cover
the
name
and
a
few
other
words
in
*NL*
a
large
scrawling
hand
.
-LRB-
We
believe
that
they
do
these
things
more
*NL*
tenderly
now
,
and
provide
a
plate
.
-RRB-
He
covered
the
whole
with
a
*NL*
black
cloth
,
threadbare
,
but
decent
,
the
tail-board
of
the
waggon
*NL*
was
returned
to
its
place
,
one
of
the
men
handed
a
certificate
of
*NL*
registry
to
Poorgrass
,
and
both
entered
the
door
,
closing
it
behind
*NL*
them
.
Their
connection
with
her
,
short
as
it
had
been
,
was
over
for
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
then
placed
the
flowers
as
enjoined
,
and
the
evergreens
*NL*
around
the
flowers
,
till
it
was
difficult
to
divine
what
the
waggon
*NL*
contained
;
he
smacked
his
whip
,
and
the
rather
pleasing
funeral
car
*NL*
crept
down
the
hill
,
and
along
the
road
to
Weatherbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
drew
on
apace
,
and
,
looking
to
the
right
towards
the
*NL*
sea
as
he
walked
beside
the
horse
,
Poorgrass
saw
strange
clouds
and
*NL*
scrolls
of
mist
rolling
over
the
long
ridges
which
girt
the
landscape
*NL*
in
that
quarter
.
They
came
in
yet
greater
volumes
,
and
indolently
*NL*
crept
across
the
intervening
valleys
,
and
around
the
withered
papery
*NL*
flags
of
the
moor
and
river
brinks
.
Then
their
dank
spongy
forms
*NL*
closed
in
upon
the
sky
.
It
was
a
sudden
overgrowth
of
atmospheric
*NL*
fungi
which
had
their
roots
in
the
neighbouring
sea
,
and
by
the
time
*NL*
that
horse
,
man
,
and
corpse
entered
Yalbury
Great
Wood
,
these
silent
*NL*
workings
of
an
invisible
hand
had
reached
them
,
and
they
were
*NL*
completely
enveloped
,
this
being
the
first
arrival
of
the
autumn
*NL*
fogs
,
and
the
first
fog
of
the
series
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
was
as
an
eye
suddenly
struck
blind
.
The
waggon
and
its
load
*NL*
rolled
no
longer
on
the
horizontal
division
between
clearness
and
*NL*
opacity
,
but
were
imbedded
in
an
elastic
body
of
a
monotonous
pallor
*NL*
throughout
.
There
was
no
perceptible
motion
in
the
air
,
not
a
*NL*
visible
drop
of
water
fell
upon
a
leaf
of
the
beeches
,
birches
,
*NL*
and
firs
composing
the
wood
on
either
side
.
The
trees
stood
in
an
*NL*
attitude
of
intentness
,
as
if
they
waited
longingly
for
a
wind
to
*NL*
come
and
rock
them
.
A
startling
quiet
overhung
all
surrounding
*NL*
things
--
so
completely
,
that
the
crunching
of
the
waggon-wheels
*NL*
was
as
a
great
noise
,
and
small
rustles
,
which
had
never
obtained
*NL*
a
hearing
except
by
night
,
were
distinctly
individualized
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
Poorgrass
looked
round
upon
his
sad
burden
as
it
loomed
*NL*
faintly
through
the
flowering
laurustinus
,
then
at
the
unfathomable
*NL*
gloom
amid
the
high
trees
on
each
hand
,
indistinct
,
shadowless
,
and
*NL*
spectre-like
in
their
monochrome
of
grey
.
He
felt
anything
but
*NL*
cheerful
,
and
wished
he
had
the
company
even
of
a
child
or
dog
.
*NL*
Stopping
the
horse
,
he
listened
.
Not
a
footstep
or
wheel
was
audible
*NL*
anywhere
around
,
and
the
dead
silence
was
broken
only
by
a
heavy
*NL*
particle
falling
from
a
tree
through
the
evergreens
and
alighting
*NL*
with
a
smart
rap
upon
the
coffin
of
poor
Fanny
.
The
fog
had
by
this
*NL*
time
saturated
the
trees
,
and
this
was
the
first
dropping
of
water
*NL*
from
the
overbrimming
leaves
.
The
hollow
echo
of
its
fall
reminded
*NL*
the
waggoner
painfully
of
the
grim
Leveller
.
Then
hard
by
came
down
*NL*
another
drop
,
then
two
or
three
.
Presently
there
was
a
continual
*NL*
tapping
of
these
heavy
drops
upon
the
dead
leaves
,
the
road
,
and
*NL*
the
travellers
.
The
nearer
boughs
were
beaded
with
the
mist
to
the
*NL*
greyness
of
aged
men
,
and
the
rusty-red
leaves
of
the
beeches
were
*NL*
hung
with
similar
drops
,
like
diamonds
on
auburn
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
roadside
hamlet
called
Roy-Town
,
just
beyond
this
wood
,
*NL*
was
the
old
inn
Buck
's
Head
.
It
was
about
a
mile
and
a
half
from
*NL*
Weatherbury
,
and
in
the
meridian
times
of
stage-coach
travelling
*NL*
had
been
the
place
where
many
coaches
changed
and
kept
their
relays
*NL*
of
horses
.
All
the
old
stabling
was
now
pulled
down
,
and
little
*NL*
remained
besides
the
habitable
inn
itself
,
which
,
standing
a
little
*NL*
way
back
from
the
road
,
signified
its
existence
to
people
far
up
and
*NL*
down
the
highway
by
a
sign
hanging
from
the
horizontal
bough
of
an
*NL*
elm
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Travellers
--
for
the
variety
_
tourist
_
had
hardly
developed
into
a
*NL*
distinct
species
at
this
date
--
sometimes
said
in
passing
,
when
they
*NL*
cast
their
eyes
up
to
the
sign-bearing
tree
,
that
artists
were
fond
*NL*
of
representing
the
signboard
hanging
thus
,
but
that
they
themselves
*NL*
had
never
before
noticed
so
perfect
an
instance
in
actual
working
*NL*
order
.
It
was
near
this
tree
that
the
waggon
was
standing
into
which
*NL*
Gabriel
Oak
crept
on
his
first
journey
to
Weatherbury
;
but
,
owing
to
*NL*
the
darkness
,
the
sign
and
the
inn
had
been
unobserved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
manners
of
the
inn
were
of
the
old-established
type
.
Indeed
,
*NL*
in
the
minds
of
its
frequenters
they
existed
as
unalterable
formulae
:
*NL*
_
e.g.
_
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Rap
with
the
bottom
of
your
pint
for
more
liquor
.
*NL*
For
tobacco
,
shout
.
*NL*
In
calling
for
the
girl
in
waiting
,
say
,
``
Maid
!
''
*NL*
Ditto
for
the
landlady
,
``
Old
Soul
!
''
etc.
,
etc.
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
relief
to
Joseph
's
heart
when
the
friendly
signboard
came
in
*NL*
view
,
and
,
stopping
his
horse
immediately
beneath
it
,
he
proceeded
to
*NL*
fulfil
an
intention
made
a
long
time
before
.
His
spirits
were
oozing
*NL*
out
of
him
quite
.
He
turned
the
horse
's
head
to
the
green
bank
,
and
*NL*
entered
the
hostel
for
a
mug
of
ale
.
*NL*
*NL*
Going
down
into
the
kitchen
of
the
inn
,
the
floor
of
which
was
a
*NL*
step
below
the
passage
,
which
in
its
turn
was
a
step
below
the
*NL*
road
outside
,
what
should
Joseph
see
to
gladden
his
eyes
but
two
*NL*
copper-coloured
discs
,
in
the
form
of
the
countenances
of
Mr.
Jan
*NL*
Coggan
and
Mr.
Mark
Clark
.
These
owners
of
the
two
most
appreciative
*NL*
throats
in
the
neighbourhood
,
within
the
pale
of
respectability
,
were
*NL*
now
sitting
face
to
face
over
a
three-legged
circular
table
,
having
*NL*
an
iron
rim
to
keep
cups
and
pots
from
being
accidentally
elbowed
*NL*
off
;
they
might
have
been
said
to
resemble
the
setting
sun
and
the
*NL*
full
moon
shining
_
vis-a-vis
_
across
the
globe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
't
is
neighbour
Poorgrass
!
''
said
Mark
Clark
.
``
I
'm
sure
your
*NL*
face
do
n't
praise
your
mistress
's
table
,
Joseph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
a
very
pale
companion
for
the
last
four
miles
,
''
said
*NL*
Joseph
,
indulging
in
a
shudder
toned
down
by
resignation
.
``
And
to
*NL*
speak
the
truth
,
't
was
beginning
to
tell
upon
me
.
I
assure
ye
,
I
*NL*
ha
'n'
t
seed
the
colour
of
victuals
or
drink
since
breakfast
time
*NL*
this
morning
,
and
that
was
no
more
than
a
dew-bit
afield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
drink
,
Joseph
,
and
do
n't
restrain
yourself
!
''
said
Coggan
,
*NL*
handing
him
a
hooped
mug
three-quarters
full
.
*NL*
*NL*
Joseph
drank
for
a
moderately
long
time
,
then
for
a
longer
time
,
*NL*
saying
,
as
he
lowered
the
jug
,
''
'T
is
pretty
drinking
--
very
pretty
*NL*
drinking
,
and
is
more
than
cheerful
on
my
melancholy
errand
,
so
to
*NL*
speak
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
True
,
drink
is
a
pleasant
delight
,
''
said
Jan
,
as
one
who
repeated
a
*NL*
truism
so
familiar
to
his
brain
that
he
hardly
noticed
its
passage
*NL*
over
his
tongue
;
and
,
lifting
the
cup
,
Coggan
tilted
his
head

*NL*
``

``
Not

*NL*

Ay

everything

Too

bad

leads

Coggan
continued
,
*NL*
with
that
tendency
to
talk
on
principles
which
is
characteristic
of
*NL*
the
barley-corn
.
``
But
I
've
never
changed
a

there

this
to

bide
in

never

his

corroborative

must

*NL*

for
it

they
deserve

have
it

such
as

I
bai

such
a
fool

to
pretend

stick
to
the
Church

the

chance

I
hate
a
feller

change
his

ancient

doctrines

getting
to

*NL*
*NL*
The
longer
Joseph
Poorgrass
remained
,
the
less
his
spirit
was
*NL*
troubled
by
the
duties
which
devolved
upon
him
this
afternoon
.
*NL*
The
minutes
glided
by
uncounted
,
until
the
evening
shades
began
*NL*
perceptibly
to
deepen
,
and
the
eyes
of
the
three
were
but
sparkling
*NL*
points
on
the
surface
of
darkness
.
Coggan
's
repeater
struck
six
*NL*
from
his
pocket
in
the
usual
still
small
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
that
moment
hasty
steps
were
heard
in
the
entry
,
and
the
door
*NL*
opened
to
admit
the
figure
of
Gabriel
Oak
,
followed
by
the
maid
of
*NL*
the
inn
bearing
a
candle
.
He
stared
sternly
at
the
one
lengthy
*NL*
and
two
round
faces
of
the
sitters
,
which
confronted
him
with
the
*NL*
expressions
of
a
fiddle
and
a
couple
of
warming-pans
.
Joseph
*NL*
Poorgrass
blinked
,
and
shrank
several
inches
into
the
background
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
soul
,
I
'm
ashamed
of
you

't
is
disgraceful

Joseph
,
*NL*
disgraceful

said
Gabriel
,
indignantly
.
``
Coggan
,
you
call
yourself
*NL*
a
man
,
and
do
n't
know
better
than
this

''
*NL*
*NL*
Coggan
looked
up
indefinitely
at
Oak
,
one
or
other
of
his
eyes
*NL*
occasionally
opening
and
closing
of
its
own
accord
,
as
if
it
were
not
*NL*
a
member
,
but
a
dozy
individual
with
a
distinct
personality
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
take
on
so
,
shepherd

said
Mark
Clark
,
looking
reproachfully
*NL*
at
the
candle
,
which
appeared
to
possess
special
features
of
interest
*NL*
for
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
can
hurt
a
dead
woman
,
''
at
length
said
Coggan
,
with
the
*NL*
precision
of
a
machine
.
``
All
that
could
be
done
for
her
is
*NL*
done

she
's
beyond
us

and
why
should
a
man
put
himself
in
a
tearing
*NL*
hurry
for
lifeless
clay
that
can
neither
feel

see

do

down

she

dead

no

Mark

emphatically

at
once
drinking
himself

*NL*
to
run
no
further
risk
of
losing
his
chance
by
the
event
alluded
*NL*
to

Jan
meanwhile
merging
his
additional
thoughts
of
to-morrow
in
a

song

Gabriel
,
seeing
that
neither

three
was
in
a
fit
state
to
take

charge
of
the
waggon
for
the
remainder

made
no

*NL*
but
,
closing
the

again
upon

went
across
to
where
the
*NL*
vehicle
stood
,
now
getting
indistinct
in
the
fog
and
gloom
of
this
*NL*
mildewy
time

He
pulled
the
horse

head
from
the
large
patch
of

turf
it
had
eaten
bare

readjusted
the
boughs
over
the
coffin

*NL*
drove
along
through
the
unwholesome
night

*NL*
It
had
gradually
become
rumoured
in
the
village
that
the
body
to

buried

was
all

followed

never
been
*NL*
individualized
as
Troy
.
Gabriel
hoped
that
the
whole
truth
of
the
*NL*
matter
might
not
be
published
till
at
any
rate
the
girl
had
been
in
*NL*
her
grave
for
a
few
days
,
when
the
interposing
barriers
of
earth
*NL*
and
time
,
and
a
sense
that
the
events
had
been
somewhat
shut
into
*NL*
oblivion
,
would
deaden
the
sting
that
revelation
and
invidious
*NL*
remark
would
have
for
Bathsheba
just
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
that
Gabriel
reached
the
old
manor-house
,
her
residence
,
*NL*
which
lay
in
his
way
to
the
church
,
it
was
quite
dark
.
A
man
came
*NL*
from
the
gate
and
said
through
the
fog
,
which
hung
between
them
like
*NL*
blown
flour
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
Poorgrass
with
the
corpse
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
recognized
the
voice
as
that
of
the
parson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
corpse
is
here
,
sir
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
just
been
to
inquire
of
Mrs.
Troy
if
she
could
tell
me
the
*NL*
reason
of
the
delay
.
I
am
afraid
it
is
too
late
now
for
the
funeral
*NL*
to
be
performed
with
proper
decency
.
Have
you
the
registrar
's
*NL*
certificate
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
I
expect
Poorgrass
has
that
;
and
he
's
at
the
*NL*
Buck
's
Head
.
I
forgot
to
ask
him
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
that
settles
the
matter
.
We
'll
put
off
the
funeral
till
*NL*
to-morrow
morning
.
The
body
may
be
brought
on
to
the
church
,
or
*NL*
it
may
be
left
here
at
the
farm
and
fetched
by
the
bearers
in
the
*NL*
morning
.
They
waited
more
than
an
hour
,
and
have
now
gone
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Gabriel
had
his
reasons
for
thinking
the
latter
a
most
objectionable
*NL*
plan
,
notwithstanding
that
Fanny
had
been
an
inmate
of
the
farm-house
*NL*
for
several
years
in
the
lifetime
of
Bathsheba
's
uncle
.
Visions
*NL*
of
several
unhappy
contingencies
which
might
arise
from
this
delay
*NL*
flitted
before
him
.
But
his
will
was
not
law
,
and
he
went
indoors
*NL*
to
inquire
of
his
mistress
what
were
her
wishes
on
the
subject
.
He
*NL*
found
her
in
an
unusual
mood
:
her
eyes
as
she
looked
up
to
him
were
*NL*
suspicious
and
perplexed
as
with
some
antecedent
thought
.
Troy
*NL*
had
not
yet
returned
.
At
first
Bathsheba
assented
with
a
mien
of
*NL*
indifference
to
his
proposition
that
they
should
go
on
to
the
church
*NL*
at
once
with
their
burden
;
but
immediately
afterwards
,
following
*NL*
Gabriel
to
the
gate
,
she
swerved
to
the
extreme
of
solicitousness
on
*NL*
Fanny
's
account
,
and
desired
that
the
girl
might
be
brought
into
the
*NL*
house
.
Oak
argued
upon
the
convenience
of
leaving
her
in
the
waggon
,
*NL*
just
as
she
lay
now
,
with
her
flowers
and
green
leaves
about
her
,
*NL*
merely
wheeling
the
vehicle
into
the
coach-house
till
the
morning
,
*NL*
but
to
no
purpose
.
``
It
is
unkind
and
unchristian
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
*NL*
leave
the
poor
thing
in
a
coach-house
all
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
''
said
the
parson
.
``
And
I
will
arrange
that
the
*NL*
funeral
shall
take
place
early
to-morrow
.
Perhaps
Mrs.
Troy
is
*NL*
right
in
feeling
that
we
can
not
treat
a
dead
fellow-creature
too
*NL*
thoughtfully
.
We
must
remember
that
though
she
may
have
erred
*NL*
grievously
in
leaving
her
home
,
she
is
still
our
sister
:
and
it
is
*NL*
to
be
believed
that
God
's
uncovenanted
mercies
are
extended
towards
*NL*
her
,
and
that
she
is
a
member
of
the
flock
of
Christ
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parson
's
words
spread
into
the
heavy
air
with
a
sad
yet
*NL*
unperturbed
cadence
,
and
Gabriel
shed
an
honest
tear
.
Bathsheba
*NL*
seemed
unmoved
.
Mr.
Thirdly
then
left
them
,
and
Gabriel
lighted
*NL*
a
lantern
.
Fetching
three
other
men
to
assist
him
,
they
bore
the
*NL*
unconscious
truant
indoors
,
placing
the
coffin
on
two
benches
in
the
*NL*
middle
of
a
little
sitting-room
next
the
hall
,
as
Bathsheba
directed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
except
Gabriel
Oak
then
left
the
room
.
He
still
*NL*
indecisively
lingered
beside
the
body
.
He
was
deeply
troubled
at
the
*NL*
wretchedly
ironical
aspect
that
circumstances
were
putting
on
with
*NL*
regard
to
Troy
's
wife
,
and
at
his
own
powerlessness
to
counteract
*NL*
them
.
In
spite
of
his
careful
manoeuvering
all
this
day
,
the
very
*NL*
worst
event
that
could
in
any
way
have
happened
in
connection
with
*NL*
the
burial
had
happened
now
.
Oak
imagined
a
terrible
discovery
*NL*
resulting
from
this
afternoon
's
work
that
might
cast
over
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
life
a
shade
which
the
interposition
of
many
lapsing
years
might
but
*NL*
indifferently
lighten
,
and
which
nothing
at
all
might
altogether
*NL*
remove
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
as
in
a
last
attempt
to
save
Bathsheba
from
,
at
any
rate
,
*NL*
immediate
anguish
,
he
looked
again
,
as
he
had
looked
before
,
at
the
*NL*
chalk
writing
upon
the
coffin-lid
.
The
scrawl
was
this
simple
one
,
*NL*
``
FANNY
ROBIN
AND
CHILD
.
''
Gabriel
took
his
handkerchief
and
carefully
*NL*
rubbed
out
the
two
latter
words
,
leaving
visible
the
inscription
*NL*
``
FANNY
ROBIN
''
only
.
He
then
left
the
room
,
and
went
out
quietly
by
*NL*
the
front
door
.

FANNY
'S
REVENGE

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
me
any
longer
ma'am
?
''
inquired
Liddy
,
at
a
later
hour
*NL*
the
same
evening
,
standing
by
the
door
with
a
chamber
candlestick
in
*NL*
her
hand
and
addressing
Bathsheba
,
who
sat
cheerless
and
alone
in
the
*NL*
large
parlour
beside
the
first
fire
of
the
season
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
more
to-night
,
Liddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
sit
up
for
master
if
you
like
,
ma'am
.
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
*NL*
of
Fanny
,
if
I
may
sit
in
my
own
room
and
have
a
candle
.
She
was
*NL*
such
a
childlike
,
nesh
young
thing
that
her
spirit
could
n't
appear
*NL*
to
anybody
if
it
tried
,
I
'm
quite
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
no
!
You
go
to
bed
.
I
'll
sit
up
for
him
myself
till
twelve
*NL*
o'clock
,
and
if
he
has
not
arrived
by
that
time
,
I
shall
give
him
up
*NL*
and
go
to
bed
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
half-past
ten
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
sit
upstairs
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
I
?
''
said
Bathsheba
,
desultorily
.
``
It
is
n't
worth
*NL*
while
--
there
's
a
fire
here
,
Liddy
.
''
She
suddenly
exclaimed
in
an
*NL*
impulsive
and
excited
whisper
,
``
Have
you
heard
anything
strange
said
*NL*
of
Fanny
?
''
The
words
had
no
sooner
escaped
her
than
an
expression
of
*NL*
unutterable
regret
crossed
her
face
,
and
she
burst
into
tears
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
not
a
word
!
''
said
Liddy
,
looking
at
the
weeping
woman
with
*NL*
astonishment
.
``
What
is
it
makes
you
cry
so
,
ma'am
;
has
anything
hurt
*NL*
you
?
''
She
came
to
Bathsheba
's
side
with
a
face
full
of
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Liddy
--
I
do
n't
want
you
any
more
.
I
can
hardly
say
why
I
have
*NL*
taken
to
crying
lately
:
I
never
used
to
cry
.
Good-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
then
left
the
parlour
and
closed
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
lonely
and
miserable
now
;
not
lonelier
actually
than
*NL*
she
had
been
before
her
marriage
;
but
her
loneliness
then
was
to
that
*NL*
of
the
present
time
as
the
solitude
of
a
mountain
is
to
the
solitude
*NL*
of
a
cave
.
And
within
the
last
day
or
two
had
come
these
disquieting
*NL*
thoughts
about
her
husband
's
past
.
Her
wayward
sentiment
that
*NL*
evening
concerning
Fanny
's
temporary
resting-place
had
been
the
*NL*
result
of
a
strange
complication
of
impulses
in
Bathsheba
's
bosom
.
*NL*
Perhaps
it
would
be
more
accurately
described
as
a
determined
*NL*
rebellion
against
her
prejudices
,
a
revulsion
from
a
lower
instinct
*NL*
of
uncharitableness
,
which
would
have
withheld
all
sympathy
from
*NL*
the
dead
woman
,
because
in
life
she
had
preceded
Bathsheba
in
the
*NL*
attentions
of
a
man
whom
Bathsheba
had
by
no
means
ceased
from
*NL*
loving
,
though
her
love
was
sick
to
death
just
now
with
the
gravity
*NL*
of
a
further
misgiving
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
five
or
ten
minutes
there
was
another
tap
at
the
door
.
Liddy
*NL*
reappeared
,
and
coming
in
a
little
way
stood
hesitating
,
until
at
*NL*
length
she
said
,
``
Maryann
has
just
heard
something
very
strange
,
but
*NL*
I
know
it
is
n't
true
.
And
we
shall
be
sure
to
know
the
rights
of
it
*NL*
in
a
day
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
nothing
connected
with
you
or
us
,
ma'am
.
It
is
about
Fanny
.
*NL*
That
same
thing
you
have
heard
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
heard
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
that
a
wicked
story
is
got
to
Weatherbury
within
this
last
*NL*
hour
--
that
--
''
Liddy
came
close
to
her
mistress
and
whispered
the
*NL*
remainder
of
the
sentence
slowly
into
her
ear
,
inclining
her
head
as
*NL*
she
spoke
in
the
direction
of
the
room
where
Fanny
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
trembled
from
head
to
foot
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
!
''
she
said
,
excitedly
.
``
And
there
's
only
one
*NL*
name
written
on
the
coffin-cover
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nor
I
,
ma'am
.
And
a
good
many
others
do
n't
;
for
we
should
surely
*NL*
have
been
told
more
about
it
if
it
had
been
true
--
do
n't
you
think
so
,
*NL*
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
might
or
we
might
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
turned
and
looked
into
the
fire
,
that
Liddy
might
not
see
*NL*
her
face
.
Finding
that
her
mistress
was
going
to
say
no
more
,
Liddy
*NL*
glided
out
,
closed
the
door
softly
,
and
went
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
face
,
as
she
continued
looking
into
the
fire
that
*NL*
evening
,
might
have
excited
solicitousness
on
her
account
even
among
*NL*
those
who
loved
her
least
.
The
sadness
of
Fanny
Robin
's
fate
did
not
*NL*
make
Bathsheba
's
glorious
,
although
she
was
the
Esther
to
this
poor
*NL*
Vashti
,
and
their
fates
might
be
supposed
to
stand
in
some
respects
*NL*
as
contrasts
to
each
other
.
When
Liddy
came
into
the
room
a
second
*NL*
time
the
beautiful
eyes
which
met
hers
had
worn
a
listless
,
weary
*NL*
look
.
When
she
went
out
after
telling
the
story
they
had
expressed
*NL*
wretchedness
in
full
activity
.
Her
simple
country
nature
,
fed
on
*NL*
old-fashioned
principles
,
was
troubled
by
that
which
would
have
*NL*
troubled
a
woman
of
the
world
very
little
,
both
Fanny
and
her
child
,
*NL*
if
she
had
one
,
being
dead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
had
grounds
for
conjecturing
a
connection
between
her
own
*NL*
history
and
the
dimly
suspected
tragedy
of
Fanny
's
end
which
Oak
*NL*
and
Boldwood
never
for
a
moment
credited
her
with
possessing
.
The
*NL*
meeting
with
the
lonely
woman
on
the
previous
Saturday
night
had
been
*NL*
unwitnessed
and
unspoken
of
.
Oak
may
have
had
the
best
of
intentions
*NL*
in
withholding
for
as
many
days
as
possible
the
details
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
to
Fanny
;
but
had
he
known
that
Bathsheba
's
perceptions
had
*NL*
already
been
exercised
in
the
matter
,
he
would
have
done
nothing
to
*NL*
lengthen
the
minutes
of
suspense
she
was
now
undergoing
,
when
the
*NL*
certainty
which
must
terminate
it
would
be
the
worst
fact
suspected
*NL*
after
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
suddenly
felt
a
longing
desire
to
speak
to
some
one
stronger
than
*NL*
herself
,
and
so
get
strength
to
sustain
her
surmised
position
with
*NL*
dignity
and
her
lurking
doubts
with
stoicism
.
Where
could
she
find
*NL*
such
a
friend
?
nowhere
in
the
house
.
She
was
by
far
the
coolest
of
*NL*
the
women
under
her
roof
.
Patience
and
suspension
of
judgement
for
*NL*
a
few
hours
were
what
she
wanted
to
learn
,
and
there
was
nobody
to
*NL*
teach
her
.
Might
she
but
go
to
Gabriel
Oak
!
--
but
that
could
not
be
.
*NL*
What
a
way
Oak
had
,
she
thought
,
of
enduring
things
.
Boldwood
,
*NL*
who
seemed
so
much
deeper
and
higher
and
stronger
in
feeling
than
*NL*
Gabriel
,
had
not
yet
learnt
,
any
more
than
she
herself
,
the
simple
*NL*
lesson
which
Oak
showed
a
mastery
of
by
every
turn
and
look
he
*NL*
gave
--
that
among
the
multitude
of
interests
by
which
he
was
*NL*
surrounded
,
those
which
affected
his
personal
well-being
were
not
the
*NL*
most
absorbing
and
important
in
his
eyes
.
Oak
meditatively
looked
*NL*
upon
the
horizon
of
circumstances
without
any
special
regard
to
his
*NL*
own
standpoint
in
the
midst
.
That
was
how
she
would
wish
to
be
.
But
*NL*
then
Oak
was
not
racked
by
incertitude
upon
the
inmost
matter
of
his
*NL*
bosom
,
as
she
was
at
this
moment
.
Oak
knew
all
about
Fanny
that
he
*NL*
wished
to
know
--
she
felt
convinced
of
that
.
If
she
were
to
go
to
him
*NL*
now
at
once
and
say
no
more
than
these
few
words
,
``
What
is
the
truth
*NL*
of
the
story
?
''
he
would
feel
bound
in
honour
to
tell
her
.
It
would
*NL*
be
an
inexpressible
relief
.
No
further
speech
would
need
to
be
*NL*
uttered
.
He
knew
her
so
well
that
no
eccentricity
of
behaviour
in
*NL*
her
would
alarm
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flung
a
cloak
round
her
,
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
.
Every
*NL*
blade
,
every
twig
was
still
.
The
air
was
yet
thick
with
moisture
,
*NL*
though
somewhat
less
dense
than
during
the
afternoon
,
and
a
steady
*NL*
smack
of
drops
upon
the
fallen
leaves
under
the
boughs
was
almost
*NL*
musical
in
its
soothing
regularity
.
It
seemed
better
to
be
out
of
*NL*
the
house
than
within
it
,
and
Bathsheba
closed
the
door
,
and
walked
*NL*
slowly
down
the
lane
till
she
came
opposite
to
Gabriel
's
cottage
,
*NL*
where
he
now
lived
alone
,
having
left
Coggan
's
house
through
being
*NL*
pinched
for
room
.
There
was
a
light
in
one
window
only
,
and
that
*NL*
was
downstairs
.
The
shutters
were
not
closed
,
nor
was
any
blind
or
*NL*
curtain
drawn
over
the
window
,
neither
robbery
nor
observation
being
*NL*
a
contingency
which
could
do
much
injury
to
the
occupant
of
the
*NL*
domicile
.
Yes
,
it
was
Gabriel
himself
who
was
sitting
up
:
he
was
*NL*
reading
.
From
her
standing-place
in
the
road
she
could
see
him
*NL*
plainly
,
sitting
quite
still
,
his
light
curly
head
upon
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
only
occasionally
looking
up
to
snuff
the
candle
which
stood
beside
*NL*
him
.
At
length
he
looked
at
the
clock
,
seemed
surprised
at
the
*NL*
lateness
of
the
hour
,
closed
his
book
,
and
arose
.
He
was
going
to
*NL*
bed
,
she
knew
,
and
if
she
tapped
it
must
be
done
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
for
her
resolve
!
She
felt
she
could
not
do
it
.
Not
for
worlds
*NL*
now
could
she
give
a
hint
about
her
misery
to
him
,
much
less
ask
him
*NL*
plainly
for
information
on
the
cause
of
Fanny
's
death
.
She
must
*NL*
suspect
,
and
guess
,
and
chafe
,
and
bear
it
all
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
a
homeless
wanderer
she
lingered
by
the
bank
,
as
if
lulled
and
*NL*
fascinated
by
the
atmosphere
of
content
which
seemed
to
spread
from
*NL*
that
little
dwelling
,
and
was
so
sadly
lacking
in
her
own
.
Gabriel
*NL*
appeared
in
an
upper
room
,
placed
his
light
in
the
window-bench
,
*NL*
and
then
--
knelt
down
to
pray
.
The
contrast
of
the
picture
with
her
*NL*
rebellious
and
agitated
existence
at
this
same
time
was
too
much
for
*NL*
her
to
bear
to
look
upon
longer
.
It
was
not
for
her
to
make
a
truce
*NL*
with
trouble
by
any
such
means
.
She
must
tread
her
giddy
distracting
*NL*
measure
to
its
last
note
,
as
she
had
begun
it
.
With
a
swollen
heart
*NL*
she
went
again
up
the
lane
,
and
entered
her
own
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
More
fevered
now
by
a
reaction
from
the
first
feelings
which
Oak
's
*NL*
example
had
raised
in
her
,
she
paused
in
the
hall
,
looking
at
the
*NL*
door
of
the
room
wherein
Fanny
lay
.
She
locked
her
fingers
,
threw
*NL*
back
her
head
,
and
strained
her
hot
hands
rigidly
across
her
*NL*
forehead
,
saying
,
with
a
hysterical
sob
,
``
Would
to
God
you
would
*NL*
speak
and
tell
me
your
secret
,
Fanny
!
...
Oh
,
I
hope
,
hope
it
is
not
*NL*
true
that
there
are
two
of
you
!
...
If
I
could
only
look
in
upon
you
*NL*
for
one
little
minute
,
I
should
know
all
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
moments
passed
,
and
she
added
,
slowly
,
``
AND
I
WILL
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
in
after
times
could
never
gauge
the
mood
which
carried
*NL*
her
through
the
actions
following
this
murmured
resolution
on
this
*NL*
memorable
evening
of
her
life
.
She
went
to
the
lumber-closet
for
a
*NL*
screw-driver
.
At
the
end
of
a
short
though
undefined
time
she
found
*NL*
herself
in
the
small
room
,
quivering
with
emotion
,
a
mist
before
her
*NL*
eyes
,
and
an
excruciating
pulsation
in
her
brain
,
standing
beside
the
*NL*
uncovered
coffin
of
the
girl
whose
conjectured
end
had
so
entirely
*NL*
engrossed
her
,
and
saying
to
herself
in
a
husky
voice
as
she
gazed
*NL*
within
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
best
to
know
the
worst
,
and
I
know
it
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
conscious
of
having
brought
about
this
situation
by
a
series
*NL*
of
actions
done
as
by
one
in
an
extravagant
dream
;
of
following
that
*NL*
idea
as
to
method
,
which
had
burst
upon
her
in
the
hall
with
glaring
*NL*
obviousness
,
by
gliding
to
the
top
of
the
stairs
,
assuring
herself
by
*NL*
listening
to
the
heavy
breathing
of
her
maids
that
they
were
asleep
,
*NL*
gliding
down
again
,
turning
the
handle
of
the
door
within
which
the
*NL*
young
girl
lay
,
and
deliberately
setting
herself
to
do
what
,
if
she
*NL*
had
anticipated
any
such
undertaking
at
night
and
alone
,
would
have
*NL*
horrified
her
,
but
which
,
when
done
,
was
not
so
dreadful
as
was
the
*NL*
conclusive
proof
of
her
husband
's
conduct
which
came
with
knowing
*NL*
beyond
doubt
the
last
chapter
of
Fanny
's
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
head
sank
upon
her
bosom
,
and
the
breath
which
had
been
*NL*
bated
in
suspense
,
curiosity
,
and
interest
,
was
exhaled
now
in
the
*NL*
form
of
a
whispered
wail
:
``
Oh-h-h
!
''
she
said
,
and
the
silent
room
*NL*
added
length
to
her
moan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
tears
fell
fast
beside
the
unconscious
pair
in
the
coffin
:
*NL*
tears
of
a
complicated
origin
,
of
a
nature
indescribable
,
almost
*NL*
indefinable
except
as
other
than
those
of
simple
sorrow
.
Assuredly
*NL*
their
wonted
fires
must
have
lived
in
Fanny
's
ashes
when
events
were
*NL*
so
shaped
as
to
chariot
her
hither
in
this
natural
,
unobtrusive
,
yet
*NL*
effectual
manner
.
The
one
feat
alone
--
that
of
dying
--
by
which
a
mean
*NL*
condition
could
be
resolved
into
a
grand
one
,
Fanny
had
achieved
.
*NL*
And
to
that
had
destiny
subjoined
this
reencounter
to-night
,
which
*NL*
had
,
in
Bathsheba
's
wild
imagining
,
turned
her
companion
's
failure
to
*NL*
success
,
her
humiliation
to
triumph
,
her
lucklessness
to
ascendency
;
*NL*
it
had
thrown
over
herself
a
garish
light
of
mockery
,
and
set
upon
*NL*
all
things
about
her
an
ironical
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
face
was
framed
in
by
that
yellow
hair
of
hers
;
and
there
was
*NL*
no
longer
much
room
for
doubt
as
to
the
origin
of
the
curl
owned
by
*NL*
Troy
.
In
Bathsheba
's
heated
fancy
the
innocent
white
countenance
*NL*
expressed
a
dim
triumphant
consciousness
of
the
pain
she
was
*NL*
retaliating
for
her
pain
with
all
the
merciless
rigour
of
the
Mosaic
*NL*
law
:
``
Burning
for
burning
;
wound
for
wound
:
strife
for
strife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
indulged
in
contemplations
of
escape
from
her
position
by
*NL*
immediate
death
,
which
,
thought
she
,
though
it
was
an
inconvenient
*NL*
and
awful
way
,
had
limits
to
its
inconvenience
and
awfulness
that
*NL*
could
not
be
overpassed
;
whilst
the
shames
of
life
were
measureless
.
*NL*
Yet
even
this
scheme
of
extinction
by
death
was
but
tamely
copying
*NL*
her
rival
's
method
without
the
reasons
which
had
glorified
it
in
her
*NL*
rival
's
case
.
She
glided
rapidly
up
and
down
the
room
,
as
was
mostly
*NL*
her
habit
when
excited
,
her
hands
hanging
clasped
in
front
of
her
,
as
*NL*
she
thought
and
in
part
expressed
in
broken
words
:
``
O
,
I
hate
her
,
*NL*
yet
I
do
n't
mean
that
I
hate
her
,
for
it
is
grievous
and
wicked
;
and
*NL*
yet
I
hate
her
a
little
!
Yes
,
my
flesh
insists
upon
hating
her
,
*NL*
whether
my
spirit
is
willing
or
no
!
...
If
she
had
only
lived
,
I
*NL*
could
have
been
angry
and
cruel
towards
her
with
some
justification
;
*NL*
but
to
be
vindictive
towards
a
poor
dead
woman
recoils
upon
myself
.
*NL*
O
God
,
have
mercy
!
I
am
miserable
at
all
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
became
at
this
moment
so
terrified
at
her
own
state
of
mind
*NL*
that
she
looked
around
for
some
sort
of
refuge
from
herself
.
The
*NL*
vision
of
Oak
kneeling
down
that
night
recurred
to
her
,
and
with
the
*NL*
imitative
instinct
which
animates
women
she
seized
upon
the
idea
,
*NL*
resolved
to
kneel
,
and
,
if
possible
,
pray
.
Gabriel
had
prayed
;
so
*NL*
would
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knelt
beside
the
coffin
,
covered
her
face
with
her
hands
,
and
*NL*
for
a
time
the
room
was
silent
as
a
tomb
.
Whether
from
a
purely
*NL*
mechanical
,
or
from
any
other
cause
,
when
Bathsheba
arose
it
was
with
*NL*
a
quieted
spirit
,
and
a
regret
for
the
antagonistic
instincts
which
*NL*
had
seized
upon
her
just
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
desire
to
make
atonement
she
took
flowers
from
a
vase
by
the
*NL*
window
,
and
began
laying
them
around
the
dead
girl
's
head
.
Bathsheba
*NL*
knew
no
other
way
of
showing
kindness
to
persons
departed
than
by
*NL*
giving
them
flowers
.
She
knew
not
how
long
she
remained
engaged
*NL*
thus
.
She
forgot
time
,
life
,
where
she
was
,
what
she
was
doing
.
A
*NL*
slamming
together
of
the
coach-house
doors
in
the
yard
brought
her
to
*NL*
herself
again
.
An
instant
after
,
the
front
door
opened
and
closed
,
*NL*
steps
crossed
the
hall
,
and
her
husband
appeared
at
the
entrance
to
*NL*
the
room
,
looking
in
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
beheld
it
all
by
degrees
,
stared
in
stupefaction
at
the
scene
,
as
*NL*
if
he
thought
it
an
illusion
raised
by
some
fiendish
incantation
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
pallid
as
a
corpse
on
end
,
gazed
back
at
him
in
the
same
*NL*
wild
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
little
are
instinctive
guesses
the
fruit
of
a
legitimate
induction
*NL*
that
,
at
this
moment
,
as
he
stood
with
the
door
in
his
hand
,
Troy
*NL*
never
once
thought
of
Fanny
in
connection
with
what
he
saw
.
His
*NL*
first
confused
idea
was
that
somebody
in
the
house
had
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
what
?
''
said
Troy
,
blankly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
go
!
I
must
go
!
''
said
Bathsheba
,
to
herself
more
than
to
him
.
*NL*
She
came
with
a
dilated
eye
towards
the
door
,
to
push
past
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
,
in
God
's
name
?
who
's
dead
?
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
say
;
let
me
go
out
.
I
want
air
!
''
she
continued
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
no
;
stay
,
I
insist
!
''
He
seized
her
hand
,
and
then
volition
*NL*
seemed
to
leave
her
,
and
she
went
off
into
a
state
of
passivity
.
He
,
*NL*
still
holding
her
,
came
up
the
room
,
and
thus
,
hand
in
hand
,
Troy
and
*NL*
Bathsheba
approached
the
coffin
's
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
candle
was
standing
on
a
bureau
close
by
them
,
and
the
light
*NL*
slanted
down
,
distinctly
enkindling
the
cold
features
of
both
mother
*NL*
and
babe
.
Troy
looked
in
,
dropped
his
wife
's
hand
,
knowledge
of
it
*NL*
all
came
over
him
in
a
lurid
sheen
,
and
he
stood
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
still
he
remained
that
he
could
be
imagined
to
have
left
in
him
no
*NL*
motive
power
whatever
.
The
clashes
of
feeling
in
all
directions
*NL*
confounded
one
another
,
produced
a
neutrality
,
and
there
was
motion
*NL*
in
none
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
her
?
''
said
Bathsheba
,
in
a
small
enclosed
echo
,
as
from
*NL*
the
interior
of
a
cell
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
,
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
originally
stood
perfectly
erect
.
And
now
,
in
the
well-nigh
*NL*
congealed
immobility
of
his
frame
could
be
discerned
an
incipient
*NL*
movement
,
as
in
the
darkest
night
may
be
discerned
light
after
a
*NL*
while
.
He
was
gradually
sinking
forwards
.
The
lines
of
his
features
*NL*
softened
,
and
dismay
modulated
to
illimitable
sadness
.
Bathsheba
*NL*
was
regarding
him
from
the
other
side
,
still
with
parted
lips
and
*NL*
distracted
eyes
.
Capacity
for
intense
feeling
is
proportionate
to
*NL*
the
general
intensity
of
the
nature
,
and
perhaps
in
all
Fanny
's
*NL*
sufferings
,
much
greater
relatively
to
her
strength
,
there
never
was
*NL*
a
time
she
suffered
in
an
absolute
sense
what
Bathsheba
suffered
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Troy
did
was
to
sink
upon
his
knees
with
an
indefinable
union
of
*NL*
remorse
and
reverence
upon
his
face
,
and
,
bending
over
Fanny
Robin
,
*NL*
gently
kissed
her
,
as
one
would
kiss
an
infant
asleep
to
avoid
*NL*
awakening
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
sight
and
sound
of
that
,
to
her
,
unendurable
act
,
Bathsheba
*NL*
sprang
towards
him
.
All
the
strong
feelings
which
had
been
scattered
*NL*
over
her
existence
since
she
knew
what
feeling
was
,
seemed
gathered
*NL*
together
into
one
pulsation
now
.
The
revulsion
from
her
indignant
*NL*
mood
a
little
earlier
,
when
she
had
meditated
upon
compromised
*NL*
honour
,
forestalment
,
eclipse
in
maternity
by
another
,
was
violent
*NL*
and
entire
.
All
that
was
forgotten
in
the
simple
and
still
*NL*
strong
attachment
of
wife
to
husband
.
She
had
sighed
for
her
*NL*
self-completeness
then
,
and
now
she
cried
aloud
against
the
severance
*NL*
of
the
union
she
had
deplored
.
She
flung
her
arms
round
Troy
's
neck
,
*NL*
exclaiming
wildly
from
the
deepest
deep
of
her
heart
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
--
do
n't
kiss
them
!
O
,
Frank
,
I
ca
n't
bear
it
--
I
ca
n't
!
I
love
*NL*
you
better
than
she
did
:
kiss
me
too
,
Frank
--
kiss
me

YOU
WILL

*NL*
FRANK

KISS
ME
TOO

''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
something
so
abnormal
and
startling
in
the
childlike
pain
*NL*
and
simplicity
of
this
appeal
from
a
woman
of
Bathsheba
's
calibre
*NL*
and
independence
,
that
Troy
,
loosening
her
tightly
clasped
arms
from
*NL*
his
neck
,
looked
at
her
in
bewilderment
.
It
was
such
an
unexpected
*NL*
revelation
of
all
women
being
alike
at
heart
,
even
those
so
different
*NL*
in
their
accessories
as
Fanny
and
this
one
beside
him
,
that
Troy
*NL*
could
hardly
seem
to
believe
her
to
be
his
proud
wife
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
Fanny
's
own
spirit
seemed
to
be
animating
her
frame
.
But
this
was
*NL*
the
mood
of
a
few
instants
only
.
When
the
momentary
surprise
had
*NL*
passed
,
his
expression
changed
to
a
silencing
imperious
gaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
kiss
you
!
''
he
said
pushing
her
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
the
wife
now
but
gone
no
further
.
Yet
,
perhaps
,
under
the
*NL*
harrowing
circumstances
,
to
speak
out
was
the
one
wrong
act
which
*NL*
can
be
better
understood
,
if
not
forgiven
in
her
,
than
the
right
and
*NL*
politic
one
,
her
rival
being
now
but
a
corpse
.
All
the
feeling
she
*NL*
had
been
betrayed
into
showing
she
drew
back
to
herself
again
by
a
*NL*
strenuous
effort
of
self-command
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
to
say
as
your
reason
?
''
she
asked
,
her
bitter
voice
*NL*
being
strangely
low
--
quite
that
of
another
woman
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
say
that
I
have
been
a
bad
,
black-hearted
man
,
''
he
*NL*
answered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
this
woman
is
your
victim
;
and
I
not
less
than
she
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
do
n't
taunt
me
,
madam
.
This
woman
is
more
to
me
,
dead
as
she
*NL*
is
,
than
ever
you
were
,
or
are
,
or
can
be
.
If
Satan
had
not
tempted
*NL*
me
with
that
face
of
yours
,
and
those
cursed
coquetries
,
I
should
*NL*
have
married
her
.
I
never
had
another
thought
till
you
came
in
my
*NL*
way
.
Would
to
God
that
I
had
;
but
it
is
all
too
late
!
''
He
turned
*NL*
to
Fanny
then
.
``
But
never
mind
,
darling
,
''
he
said
;
``
in
the
sight
of
*NL*
Heaven
you
are
my
very
,
very
wife
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
these
words
there
arose
from
Bathsheba
's
lips
a
long
,
low
cry
of
*NL*
measureless
despair
and
indignation
,
such
a
wail
of
anguish
as
had
*NL*
never
before
been
heard
within
those
old-inhabited
walls
.
It
was
the
*NL*
``
Tetelestai
''
-LSB-
GREEK
word
meaning
``
it
is
finished
''
-RSB-
of
her
union
with
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
she
's
--
that
,
--
what
--
am
I
?
''
she
added
,
as
a
continuation
of
the
*NL*
same
cry
,
and
sobbing
pitifully
:
and
the
rarity
with
her
of
such
*NL*
abandonment
only
made
the
condition
more
dire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
nothing
to
me
--
nothing
,
''
said
Troy
,
heartlessly
.
``
A
*NL*
ceremony
before
a
priest
does
n't
make
a
marriage
.
I
am
not
morally
*NL*
yours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
vehement
impulse
to
flee
from
him
,
to
run
from
this
place
,
hide
,
*NL*
and
escape
his
words
at
any
price
,
not
stopping
short
of
death
*NL*
itself
,
mastered
Bathsheba
now
.
She
waited
not
an
instant
,
but
*NL*
turned
to
the
door
and
ran
out
.

CHAPTER
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
UNDER
A
TREE
--
REACTION
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
went
along
the
dark
road
,
neither
knowing
nor
caring
about
*NL*
the
direction
or
issue
of
her
flight
.
The
first
time
that
she
*NL*
definitely
noticed
her
position
was
when
she
reached
a
gate
leading
*NL*
into
a
thicket
overhung
by
some
large
oak
and
beech
trees
.
On
*NL*
looking
into
the
place
,
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
seen
it
by
*NL*
daylight
on
some
previous
occasion
,
and
that
what
appeared
like
an
*NL*
impassable
thicket
was
in
reality
a
brake
of
fern
now
withering
fast
.
*NL*
She
could
think
of
nothing
better
to
do
with
her
palpitating
self
*NL*
than
to
go
in
here
and
hide
;
and
entering
,
she
lighted
on
a
spot
*NL*
sheltered
from
the
damp
fog
by
a
reclining
trunk
,
where
she
sank
down
*NL*
upon
a
tangled
couch
of
fronds
and
stems
.
She
mechanically
pulled
*NL*
some
armfuls
round
her
to
keep
off
the
breezes
,
and
closed
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Whether
she
slept
or
not
that
night
Bathsheba
was
not
clearly
aware
.
*NL*
But
it
was
with
a
freshened
existence
and
a
cooler
brain
that
,
a
long
*NL*
time
afterwards
,
she
became
conscious
of
some
interesting
proceedings
*NL*
which
were
going
on
in
the
trees
above
her
head
and
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
coarse-throated
chatter
was
the
first
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
sparrow
just
waking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
:
``
Chee-weeze-weeze-weeze
!
''
from
another
retreat
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
finch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Third
:
``
Tink-tink-tink-tink-a-chink
!
''
from
the
hedge
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chuck-chuck-chuck
!
''
overhead
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
squirrel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
from
the
road
,
``
With
my
ra-ta-ta
,
and
my
rum-tum-tum
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
ploughboy
.
Presently
he
came
opposite
,
and
she
believed
*NL*
from
his
voice
that
he
was
one
of
the
boys
on
her
own
farm
.
He
was
*NL*
followed
by
a
shambling
tramp
of
heavy
feet
,
and
looking
through
the
*NL*
ferns
Bathsheba
could
just
discern
in
the
wan
light
of
daybreak
a
*NL*
team
of
her
own
horses
.
They
stopped
to
drink
at
a
pond
on
the
other
*NL*
side
of
the
way
.
She
watched
them
flouncing
into
the
pool
,
drinking
,
*NL*
tossing
up
their
heads
,
drinking
again
,
the
water
dribbling
from
*NL*
their
lips
in
silver
threads
.
There
was
another
flounce
,
and
they
*NL*
came
out
of
the
pond
,
and
turned
back
again
towards
the
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
further
around
.
Day
was
just
dawning
,
and
beside
its
cool
*NL*
air
and
colours
her
heated
actions
and
resolves
of
the
night
stood
*NL*
out
in
lurid
contrast
.
She
perceived
that
in
her
lap
,
and
clinging
*NL*
to
her
hair
,
were
red
and
yellow
leaves
which
had
come
down
from
*NL*
the
tree
and
settled
silently
upon
her
during
her
partial
sleep
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
shook
her
dress
to
get
rid
of
them
,
when
multitudes
of
the
*NL*
same
family
lying
round
about
her
rose
and
fluttered
away
in
the
*NL*
breeze
thus
created
,
``
like
ghosts
from
an
enchanter
fleeing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
opening
towards
the
east
,
and
the
glow
from
the
as
yet
*NL*
unrisen
sun
attracted
her
eyes
thither
.
From
her
feet
,
and
between
*NL*
the
beautiful
yellowing
ferns
with
their
feathery
arms
,
the
ground
*NL*
sloped
downwards
to
a
hollow
,
in
which
was
a
species
of
swamp
,
*NL*
dotted
with
fungi
.
A
morning
mist
hung
over
it
now
--
a
fulsome
*NL*
yet
magnificent
silvery
veil
,
full
of
light
from
the
sun
,
yet
*NL*
semi-opaque
--
the
hedge
behind
it
being
in
some
measure
hidden
by
its
*NL*
hazy
luminousness
.
Up
the
sides
of
this
depression
grew
sheaves
of
*NL*
the
common
rush
,
and
here
and
there
a
peculiar
species
of
flag
,
the
*NL*
blades
of
which
glistened
in
the
emerging
sun
,
like
scythes
.
But
*NL*
the
general
aspect
of
the
swamp
was
malignant
.
From
its
moist
and
*NL*
poisonous
coat
seemed
to
be
exhaled
the
essences
of
evil
things
in
*NL*
the
earth
,
and
in
the
waters
under
the
earth
.
The
fungi
grew
in
*NL*
all
manner
of
positions
from
rotting
leaves
and
tree
stumps
,
some
*NL*
exhibiting
to
her
listless
gaze
their
clammy
tops
,
others
their
*NL*
oozing
gills
.
Some
were
marked
with
great
splotches
,
red
as
arterial
*NL*
blood
,
others
were
saffron
yellow
,
and
others
tall
and
attenuated
,
*NL*
with
stems
like
macaroni
.
Some
were
leathery
and
of
richest
browns
.
*NL*
The
hollow
seemed
a
nursery
of
pestilences
small
and
great
,
in
the
*NL*
immediate
neighbourhood
of
comfort
and
health
,
and
Bathsheba
arose
*NL*
with
a
tremor
at
the
thought
of
having
passed
the
night
on
the
brink
*NL*
of
so
dismal
a
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
now
other
footsteps
to
be
heard
along
the
road
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
nerves
were
still
unstrung
:
she
crouched
down
out
of
*NL*
sight
again
,
and
the
pedestrian
came
into
view
.
He
was
a
schoolboy
,
*NL*
with
a
bag
slung
over
his
shoulder
containing
his
dinner
,
and
a
*NL*
book
in
his
hand
.
He
paused
by
the
gate
,
and
,
without
looking
up
,
*NL*
continued
murmuring
words
in
tones
quite
loud
enough
to
reach
her
*NL*
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
,
O
Lord
'
:
--
that
I
know
out
o
'
book
.
*NL*
`
Give
us
,
give
us
,
give
us
,
give
us
,
give
us
'
:
--
that
I
know
.
`
Grace
*NL*
that
,
grace
that
,
grace
that
,
grace
that
'
:
--
that
I
know
.
''
Other
*NL*
words
followed
to
the
same
effect
.
The
boy
was
of
the
dunce
class
*NL*
apparently
;
the
book
was
a
psalter
,
and
this
was
his
way
of
learning
*NL*
the
collect
.
In
the
worst
attacks
of
trouble
there
appears
to
be
*NL*
always
a
superficial
film
of
consciousness
which
is
left
disengaged
*NL*
and
open
to
the
notice
of
trifles
,
and
Bathsheba
was
faintly
amused
*NL*
at
the
boy
's
method
,
till
he
too
passed
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
this
time
stupor
had
given
place
to
anxiety
,
and
anxiety
began
to
*NL*
make
room
for
hunger
and
thirst
.
A
form
now
appeared
upon
the
rise
*NL*
on
the
other
side
of
the
swamp
,
half-hidden
by
the
mist
,
and
came
*NL*
towards
Bathsheba
.
The
woman
--
for
it
was
a
woman
--
approached
with
*NL*
her
face
askance
,
as
if
looking
earnestly
on
all
sides
of
her
.
*NL*
When
she
got
a
little
further
round
to
the
left
,
and
drew
nearer
,
*NL*
Bathsheba
could
see
the
newcomer
's
profile
against
the
sunny
sky
,
and
*NL*
knew
the
wavy
sweep
from
forehead
to
chin
,
with
neither
angle
nor
*NL*
decisive
line
anywhere
about
it
,
to
be
the
familiar
contour
of
Liddy
*NL*
Smallbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
heart
bounded
with
gratitude
in
the
thought
that
she
was
*NL*
not
altogether
deserted
,
and
she
jumped
up
.
``
Oh
,
Liddy
!
''
she
said
,
*NL*
or
attempted
to
say
;
but
the
words
had
only
been
framed
by
her
lips
;
*NL*
there
came
no
sound
.
She
had
lost
her
voice
by
exposure
to
the
*NL*
clogged
atmosphere
all
these
hours
of
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
ma'am
!
I
am
so
glad
I
have
found
you
,
''
said
the
girl
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
saw
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
ca
n't
come
across
,
''
Bathsheba
said
in
a
whisper
,
which
she
*NL*
vainly
endeavoured
to
make
loud
enough
to
reach
Liddy
's
ears
.
Liddy
,
*NL*
not
knowing
this
,
stepped
down
upon
the
swamp
,
saying
,
as
she
did
so
,
*NL*
``
It
will
bear
me
up
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
never
forgot
that
transient
little
picture
of
Liddy
*NL*
crossing
the
swamp
to
her
there
in
the
morning
light
.
Iridescent
*NL*
bubbles
of
dank
subterranean
breath
rose
from
the
sweating
sod
beside
*NL*
the
waiting-maid
's
feet
as
she
trod
,
hissing
as
they
burst
and
*NL*
expanded
away
to
join
the
vapoury
firmament
above
.
Liddy
did
not
*NL*
sink
,
as
Bathsheba
had
anticipated
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
landed
safely
on
the
other
side
,
and
looked
up
at
the
beautiful
*NL*
though
pale
and
weary
face
of
her
young
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
thing
!
''
said
Liddy
,
with
tears
in
her
eyes
,
``
Do
hearten
*NL*
yourself
up
a
little
,
ma'am
.
However
did
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
speak
above
a
whisper
--
my
voice
is
gone
for
the
present
,
''
*NL*
said
Bathsheba
,
hurriedly
.
``
I
suppose
the
damp
air
from
that
*NL*
hollow
has
taken
it
away
.
Liddy
,
do
n't
question
me
,
mind
.
Who
*NL*
sent
you
--
anybody
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nobody
.
I
thought
,
when
I
found
you
were
not
at
home
,
that
*NL*
something
cruel
had
happened
.
I
fancy
I
heard
his
voice
late
last
*NL*
night
;
and
so
,
knowing
something
was
wrong
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
he
at
home
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
he
left
just
before
I
came
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Fanny
taken
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
yet
.
She
will
soon
be
--
at
nine
o'clock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
wo
n't
go
home
at
present
,
then
.
Suppose
we
walk
about
in
this
*NL*
wood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
,
without
exactly
understanding
everything
,
or
anything
,
in
this
*NL*
episode
,
assented
,
and
they
walked
together
further
among
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
had
better
come
in
,
ma'am
,
and
have
something
to
eat
.
You
*NL*
will
die
of
a
chill
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
come
indoors
yet
--
perhaps
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
get
you
something
to
eat
,
and
something
else
to
put
over
*NL*
your
head
besides
that
little
shawl
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
will
,
Liddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
vanished
,
and
at
the
end
of
twenty
minutes
returned
with
a
*NL*
cloak
,
hat
,
some
slices
of
bread
and
butter
,
a
tea-cup
,
and
some
hot
*NL*
tea
in
a
little
china
jug
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
Fanny
gone
?
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
her
companion
,
pouring
out
the
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
wrapped
herself
up
and
ate
and
drank
sparingly
.
Her
voice
*NL*
was
then
a
little
clearer
,
and
trifling
colour
returned
to
her
face
.
*NL*
``
Now
we
'll
walk
about
again
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
wandered
about
the
wood
for
nearly
two
hours
,
Bathsheba
replying
*NL*
in
monosyllables
to
Liddy
's
prattle
,
for
her
mind
ran
on
one
subject
,
*NL*
and
one
only
.
She
interrupted
with
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
Fanny
is
gone
by
this
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
go
and
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
back
with
the
information
that
the
men
were
just
taking
*NL*
away
the
corpse
;
that
Bathsheba
had
been
inquired
for
;
that
she
had
*NL*
replied
to
the
effect
that
her
mistress
was
unwell
and
could
not
be
*NL*
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
they
think
I
am
in
my
bedroom
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
Liddy
then
ventured
to
add
:
``
You
said
when
I
first
found
you
*NL*
that
you
might
never
go
home
again
--
you
did
n't
mean
it
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
I
've
altered
my
mind
.
It
is
only
women
with
no
pride
in
them
*NL*
who
run
away
from
their
husbands
.
There
is
one
position
worse
than
*NL*
that
of
being
found
dead
in
your
husband
's
house
from
his
ill
usage
,
*NL*
and
that
is
,
to
be
found
alive
through
having
gone
away
to
the
house
*NL*
of
somebody
else
.
I
've
thought
of
it
all
this
morning
,
and
I
've
*NL*
chosen
my
course
.
A
runaway
wife
is
an
encumbrance
to
everybody
,
*NL*
a
burden
to
herself
and
a
byword
--
all
of
which
make
up
a
heap
of
*NL*
misery
greater
than
any
that
comes
by
staying
at
home
--
though
this
*NL*
may
include
the
trifling
items
of
insult
,
beating
,
and
starvation
.
*NL*
Liddy
,
if
ever
you
marry
--
God
forbid
that
you
ever
should
!
--
you
'll
*NL*
find
yourself
in
a
fearful
situation
;
but
mind
this
,
do
n't
you
*NL*
flinch
.
Stand
your
ground
,
and
be
cut
to
pieces
.
That
's
what
I
'm
*NL*
going
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
mistress
,
do
n't
talk
so
!
''
said
Liddy
,
taking
her
hand
;
``
but
I
*NL*
knew
you
had
too
much
sense
to
bide
away
.
May
I
ask
what
dreadful
*NL*
thing
it
is
that
has
happened
between
you
and
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
ask
;
but
I
may
not
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
ten
minutes
they
returned
to
the
house
by
a
circuitous
*NL*
route
,
entering
at
the
rear
.
Bathsheba
glided
up
the
back
stairs
to
*NL*
a
disused
attic
,
and
her
companion
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liddy
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
lighter
heart
,
for
youth
and
hope
had
*NL*
begun
to
reassert
themselves
;
``
you
are
to
be
my
confidante
for
the
*NL*
present
--
somebody
must
be
--
and
I
choose
you
.
Well
,
I
shall
take
up
*NL*
my
abode
here
for
a
while
.
Will
you
get
a
fire
lighted
,
put
down
*NL*
a
piece
of
carpet
,
and
help
me
to
make
the
place
comfortable
.
*NL*
Afterwards
,
I
want
you
and
Maryann
to
bring
up
that
little
stump
*NL*
bedstead
in
the
small
room
,
and
the
bed
belonging
to
it
,
and
a
table
,
*NL*
and
some
other
things
...
What
shall
I
do
to
pass
the
heavy
time
*NL*
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hemming
handkerchiefs
is
a
very
good
thing
,
''
said
Liddy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
no
!
I
hate
needlework
--
I
always
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knitting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
might
finish
your
sampler
.
Only
the
carnations
and
peacocks
*NL*
want
filling
in

and
then
it
could
be
framed
and
glazed
,
and
hung
*NL*
beside
your
aunt
's
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Samplers
are
out
of
date
--
horribly
countrified
.
No
Liddy
,
I
'll
*NL*
read
.
Bring
up
some
books
--
not
new
ones
.
I
have
n't
heart
to

*NL*
anything
new

*NL*
*NL*
``
Some

,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Some
of
those
we
stowed
away
in
boxes
.
''
A
faint
gleam
*NL*
of
humour
passed
over
her
face
as
she
said
:
``
Bring
Beaumont
and
*NL*
Fletcher
's

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
story
of
the
black
man
,
who
murdered
his
wife
Desdemona
?
*NL*
It
is
a
nice
dismal
one
that
would
suit
you
excellent
just
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Liddy
,
you
've
been
looking
into
my
books
without
telling
me
;
*NL*
and
I
said
you
were
not
to

How
do
you
know
it
would
suit

It
*NL*
would
n't
suit

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

they
do
n't

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
that
day
Bathsheba
and
Liddy
lived
in
the
attic
in
a
state
of
*NL*
barricade
;
a
precaution
which
proved
to
be
needless
as
against
Troy
,
*NL*
for
he
did
not
appear
in
the
neighbourhood
or
trouble
them
at
all
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
sat
at
the
window
till
sunset
,
sometimes
attempting
to
*NL*
read
,
at
other
times
watching
every
movement
outside
without
much
*NL*
purpose
,
and
listening
without
much
interest
to
every
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sun
went
down
almost
blood-red
that
night
,
and
a
livid
cloud
*NL*
received
its
rays
in
the
east
.
Up
against
this
dark
background
the
*NL*
west
front
of
the
church
tower
--
the
only
part
of
the
edifice
visible
*NL*
from
the
farm-house
windows
--
rose
distinct
and
lustrous
,
the
vane
*NL*
upon
the
summit
bristling
with
rays
.
Hereabouts
,
at
six
o'clock
,
the
*NL*
young
men
of
the
village
gathered
,
as
was
their
custom
,
for
a
game
*NL*
of
Prisoners
'
base
.
The
spot
had
been
consecrated
to
this
ancient
*NL*
diversion
from
time
immemorial
,
the
old
stocks
conveniently
forming
*NL*
a
base
facing
the
boundary
of
the
churchyard
,
in
front
of
which
the
*NL*
ground
was
trodden
hard
and
bare
as
a
pavement
by
the
players
.
She
*NL*
could
see
the
brown
and
black
heads
of
the
young
lads
darting
about
*NL*
right
and
left
,
their
white
shirt-sleeves
gleaming
in
the
sun
;
*NL*
whilst
occasionally
a
shout
and
a
peal
of
hearty
laughter
varied
the
*NL*
stillness
of
the
evening
air
.
They
continued
playing
for
a
quarter
*NL*
of
an
hour
or
so
,
when
the
game
concluded
abruptly
,
and
the
players
*NL*
leapt
over
the
wall
and
vanished
round
to
the
other
side
behind
a
*NL*
yew-tree
,
which
was
also
half
behind
a
beech
,
now
spreading
in
one
*NL*
mass
of
golden
foliage
,
on
which
the
branches
traced
black
lines
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
did
the
base-players
finish
their
game
so
suddenly
?
''
Bathsheba
*NL*
inquired
,
the
next
time
that
Liddy
entered
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
't
was
because
two
men
came
just
then
from
Casterbridge
and
*NL*
began
putting
up
a
grand
carved
tombstone
,
''
said
Liddy
.
``
The
lads
*NL*
went
to
see
whose
it
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
?
''
Bathsheba
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

Liddy

CHAPTER
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
TROY
'S
ROMANTICISM
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
When
Troy
's
wife
had
left
the
house
at
the
previous
midnight
his
*NL*
first
act
was
to
cover
the
dead
from
sight
.
This
done
he
ascended
*NL*
the
stairs
,
and
throwing
himself
down
upon
the
bed
dressed
as
he
was
,
*NL*
he
waited
miserably
for
the
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fate
had
dealt
grimly
with
him
through
the
last
four-and-twenty
*NL*
hours
.
His
day
had
been
spent
in
a
way
which
varied
very
materially
*NL*
from
his
intentions
regarding
it
.
There
is
always
an
inertia
to
*NL*
be
overcome
in
striking
out
a
new
line
of
conduct
--
not
more
in
*NL*
ourselves
,
it
seems
,
than
in
circumscribing
events
,
which
appear
as
*NL*
if
leagued
together
to
allow
no
novelties
in
the
way
of
amelioration
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
pounds
having
been
secured
from
Bathsheba
,
he
had
managed
to
*NL*
add
to
the
sum
every
farthing
he
could
muster
on
his
own
account
,
*NL*
which
had
been
seven
pounds
ten
.
With
this
money
,
twenty-seven
*NL*
pounds
ten
in
all
,
he
had
hastily
driven
from
the
gate
that
morning
*NL*
to
keep
his
appointment
with
Fanny
Robin
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
Casterbridge
he
left
the
horse
and
trap
at
an
inn
,
and
*NL*
at
five
minutes
before
ten
came
back
to
the
bridge
at
the
lower
end
*NL*
of
the
town
,
and
sat
himself
upon
the
parapet
.
The
clocks
struck
*NL*
the
hour
,
and
no
Fanny
appeared
.
In
fact
,
at
that
moment
she
was
*NL*
being
robed
in
her
grave-clothes
by
two
attendants
at
the
Union
*NL*
poorhouse
--
the
first
and
last
tiring-women
the
gentle
creature
had
*NL*
ever
been
honoured
with
.
The
quarter
went
,
the
half
hour
.
A
rush
of
*NL*
recollection
came
upon
Troy
as
he
waited
:
this
was
the
second
time
*NL*
she
had
broken
a
serious
engagement
with
him
.
In
anger
he
vowed
*NL*
it
should
be
the
last
,
and
at
eleven
o'clock
,
when
he
had
lingered
*NL*
and
watched
the
stone
of
the
bridge
till
he
knew
every
lichen
upon
*NL*
their
face
and
heard
the
chink
of
the
ripples
underneath
till
they
*NL*
oppressed
him
,
he
jumped
from
his
seat
,
went
to
the
inn
for
his
*NL*
gig
,
and
in
a
bitter
mood
of
indifference
concerning
the
past
,
and
*NL*
recklessness
about
the
future
,
drove
on
to
Budmouth
races
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
reached
the
race-course
at
two
o'clock
,
and
remained
either
there
*NL*
or
in
the
town
till
nine
.
But
Fanny
's
image
,
as
it
had
appeared
to
*NL*
him
in
the
sombre
shadows
of
that
Saturday
evening
,
returned
to
his
*NL*
mind
,
backed
up
by
Bathsheba
's
reproaches
.
He
vowed
he
would
not
*NL*
bet
,
and
he
kept
his
vow
,
for
on
leaving
the
town
at
nine
o'clock
in
*NL*
the
evening
he
had
diminished
his
cash
only
to
the
extent
of
a
few
*NL*
shillings
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
trotted
slowly
homeward
,
and
it
was
now
that
he
was
struck
for
the
*NL*
first
time
with
a
thought
that
Fanny
had
been
really
prevented
by
*NL*
illness
from
keeping
her
promise
.
This
time
she
could
have
made
no
*NL*
mistake
.
He
regretted
that
he
had
not
remained
in
Casterbridge
and
*NL*
made
inquiries
.
Reaching
home
he
quietly
unharnessed
the
horse
and
*NL*
came
indoors
,
as
we
have
seen
,
to
the
fearful
shock
that
awaited
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
it
grew
light
enough
to
distinguish
objects
,
Troy
arose
*NL*
from
the
coverlet
of
the
bed
,
and
in
a
mood
of
absolute
indifference
*NL*
to
Bathsheba
's
whereabouts
,
and
almost
oblivious
of
her
existence
,
he
*NL*
stalked
downstairs
and
left
the
house
by
the
back
door
.
His
walk
was
*NL*
towards
the
churchyard
,
entering
which
he
searched
around
till
he
*NL*
found
a
newly
dug
unoccupied
grave
--
the
grave
dug
the
day
before
for
*NL*
Fanny
.
The
position
of
this
having
been
marked
,
he
hastened
on
to
*NL*
Casterbridge
,
only
pausing
and
musing
for
a
while
at
the
hill
whereon
*NL*
he
had
last
seen
Fanny
alive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reaching
the
town
,
Troy
descended
into
a
side
street
and
entered
a
*NL*
pair
of
gates
surmounted
by
a
board
bearing
the
words
,
``
Lester
,
stone
*NL*
and
marble
mason
.
''
Within
were
lying
about
stones
of
all
sizes
and
*NL*
designs
,
inscribed
as
being
sacred
to
the
memory
of
unnamed
persons
*NL*
who
had
not
yet
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
was
so
unlike
himself
now
in
look
,
word
,
and
deed
,
that
the
*NL*
want
of
likeness
was
perceptible
even
to
his
own
consciousness
.
His
*NL*
method
of
engaging
himself
in
this
business
of
purchasing
a
tomb
was
*NL*
that
of
an
absolutely
unpractised
man
.
He
could
not
bring
himself
*NL*
to
consider
,
calculate
,
or
economize
.
He
waywardly
wished
for
*NL*
something
,
and
he
set
about
obtaining
it
like
a
child
in
a
nursery
.
*NL*
``
I
want
a
good
tomb
,
''
he
said
to
the
man
who
stood
in
a
little
office
*NL*
within
the
yard
.
``
I
want
as
good
a
one
as
you
can
give
me
for
*NL*
twenty-seven
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
all
the
money
he
possessed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
sum
to
include
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Everything
.
Cutting
the
name
,
carriage
to
Weatherbury
,
and
*NL*
erection
.
And
I
want
it
now
,
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
could
not
get
anything
special
worked
this
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
have
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
would
like
one
of
these
in
stock
it
could
be
got
ready
*NL*
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Troy
,
impatiently
.
``
Let
's
see
what
you
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
best
I
have
in
stock
is
this
one
,
''
said
the
stone-cutter
,
going
*NL*
into
a
shed
.
``
Here
's
a
marble
headstone
beautifully
crocketed
,
with
*NL*
medallions
beneath
of
typical
subjects
;
here
's
the
footstone
after
*NL*
the
same
pattern
,
and
here
's
the
coping
to
enclose
the
grave
.
The
*NL*
polishing
alone
of
the
set
cost
me
eleven
pounds
--
the
slabs
are
the
*NL*
best
of
their
kind
,
and
I
can
warrant
them
to
resist
rain
and
frost
*NL*
for
a
hundred
years
without
flying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
could
add
the
name
,
and
put
it
up
at
Weatherbury
for
the
sum
*NL*
you
mention
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Get
it
done
to-day
,
and
I
'll
pay
the
money
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
agreed
,
and
wondered
at
such
a
mood
in
a
visitor
who
wore
not
*NL*
a
shred
of
mourning
.
Troy
then
wrote
the
words
which
were
to
form
*NL*
the
inscription
,
settled
the
account
and
went
away
.
In
the
afternoon
*NL*
he
came
back
again
,
and
found
that
the
lettering
was
almost
done
.
He
*NL*
waited
in
the
yard
till
the
tomb
was
packed
,
and
saw
it
placed
in
the
*NL*
cart
and
starting
on
its
way
to
Weatherbury
,
giving
directions
to
the
*NL*
two
men
who
were
to
accompany
it
to
inquire
of
the
sexton
for
the
*NL*
grave
of
the
person
named
in
the
inscription
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
quite
dark
when
Troy
came
out
of
Casterbridge
.
He
carried
*NL*
rather
a
heavy
basket
upon
his
arm
,
with
which
he
strode
moodily
*NL*
along
the
road
,
resting
occasionally
at
bridges
and
gates
,
whereon
*NL*
he
deposited
his
burden
for
a
time
.
Midway
on
his
journey
he
met
,
*NL*
returning
in
the
darkness
,
the
men
and
the
waggon
which
had
conveyed
*NL*
the
tomb
.
He
merely
inquired
if
the
work
was
done
,
and
,
on
being
*NL*
assured
that
it
was
,
passed
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
entered
Weatherbury
churchyard
about
ten
o'clock
and
went
*NL*
immediately
to
the
corner
where
he
had
marked
the
vacant
grave
early
*NL*
in
the
morning
.
It
was
on
the
obscure
side
of
the
tower
,
screened
to
*NL*
a
great
extent
from
the
view
of
passers
along
the
road
--
a
spot
which
*NL*
until
lately
had
been
abandoned
to
heaps
of
stones
and
bushes
of
*NL*
alder
,
but
now
it
was
cleared
and
made
orderly
for
interments
,
by
*NL*
reason
of
the
rapid
filling
of
the
ground
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
now
stood
the
tomb
as
the
men
had
stated
,
snow-white
and
shapely
*NL*
in
the
gloom
,
consisting
of
head
and
foot-stone
,
and
enclosing
border
*NL*
of
marble-work
uniting
them
.
In
the
midst
was
mould
,
suitable
for
*NL*
plants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
deposited
his
basket
beside
the
tomb
,
and
vanished
for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
.
When
he
returned
he
carried
a
spade
and
a
lantern
,
the
*NL*
light
of
which
he
directed
for
a
few
moments
upon
the
marble
,
whilst
*NL*
he
read
the
inscription
.
He
hung
his
lantern
on
the
lowest
bough
*NL*
of
the
yew-tree
,
and
took
from
his
basket
flower-roots
of
several
*NL*
varieties
.
There
were
bundles
of
snow-drop
,
hyacinth
and
crocus
*NL*
bulbs
,
violets
and
double
daisies
,
which
were
to
bloom
in
early
*NL*
spring
,
and
of
carnations
,
pinks
,
picotees
,
lilies
of
the
valley
,
*NL*
forget-me-not
,
summer
's
farewell
,
meadow-saffron
and
others
,
for
*NL*
the
later
seasons
of
the
year
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
laid
these
out
upon
the
grass
,
and
with
an
impassive
face
set
*NL*
to
work
to
plant
them
.
The
snowdrops
were
arranged
in
a
line
on
the
*NL*
outside
of
the
coping
,
the
remainder
within
the
enclosure
of
the
*NL*
grave
.
The
crocuses
and
hyacinths
were
to
grow
in
rows
;
some
of
*NL*
the
summer
flowers
he
placed
over
her
head
and
feet
,
the
lilies
and
*NL*
forget-me-nots
over
her
heart
.
The
remainder
were
dispersed
in
the
*NL*
spaces
between
these
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
,
in
his
prostration
at
this
time
,
had
no
perception
that
in
the
*NL*
futility
of
these
romantic
doings
,
dictated
by
a
remorseful
reaction
*NL*
from
previous
indifference
,
there
was
any
element
of
absurdity
.
*NL*
Deriving
his
idiosyncrasies
from
both
sides
of
the
Channel
,
he
showed
*NL*
at
such
junctures
as
the
present
the
inelasticity
of
the
Englishman
,
*NL*
together
with
that
blindness
to
the
line
where
sentiment
verges
on
*NL*
mawkishness
,
characteristic
of
the
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
cloudy
,
muggy
,
and
very
dark
night
,
and
the
rays
from
Troy
's
*NL*
lantern
spread
into
the
two
old
yews
with
a
strange
illuminating
*NL*
power
,
flickering
,
as
it
seemed
,
up
to
the
black
ceiling
of
cloud
*NL*
above
.
He
felt
a
large
drop
of
rain
upon
the
back
of
his
hand
,
and
*NL*
presently
one
came
and
entered
one
of
the
holes
of
the
lantern
,
*NL*
whereupon
the
candle
sputtered
and
went
out
.
Troy
was
weary
and
*NL*
it
being
now
not
far
from
midnight
,
and
the
rain
threatening
to
*NL*
increase
,
he
resolved
to
leave
the
finishing
touches
of
his
labour
*NL*
until
the
day
should
break
.
He
groped
along
the
wall
and
over
the
*NL*
graves
in
the
dark
till
he
found
himself
round
at
the
north
side
.
*NL*
Here
he
entered
the
porch
,
and
,
reclining
upon
the
bench
within
,
*NL*
fell
asleep
.

CHAPTER
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
GURGOYLE
:
ITS
DOINGS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
tower
of
Weatherbury
Church
was
a
square
erection
of
*NL*
fourteenth-century
date
,
having
two
stone
gurgoyles
on
each
of
the
*NL*
four
faces
of
its
parapet
.
Of
these
eight
carved
protuberances
*NL*
only
two
at
this
time
continued
to
serve
the
purpose
of
their
*NL*
erection
--
that
of
spouting
the
water
from
the
lead
roof
within
.
One
*NL*
mouth
in
each
front
had
been
closed
by
bygone
church-wardens
as
*NL*
superfluous
,
and
two
others
were
broken
away
and
choked
--
a
matter
not
*NL*
of
much
consequence
to
the
wellbeing
of
the
tower
,
for
the
two
mouths
*NL*
which
still
remained
open
and
active
were
gaping
enough
to
do
all
the
*NL*
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
been
sometimes
argued
that
there
is
no
truer
criterion
of
the
*NL*
vitality
of
any
given
art-period
than
the
power
of
the
master-spirits
*NL*
of
that
time
in
grotesque
;
and
certainly
in
the
instance
of
Gothic
*NL*
art
there
is
no
disputing
the
proposition
.
Weatherbury
tower
was
a
*NL*
somewhat
early
instance
of
the
use
of
an
ornamental
parapet
in
parish
*NL*
as
distinct
from
cathedral
churches
,
and
the
gurgoyles
,
which
are
the
*NL*
necessary
correlatives
of
a
parapet
,
were
exceptionally
prominent
--
of
*NL*
the
boldest
cut
that
the
hand
could
shape
,
and
of
the
most
original
*NL*
design
that
a
human
brain
could
conceive
.
There
was
,
so
to
speak
,
*NL*
that
symmetry
in
their
distortion
which
is
less
the
characteristic
*NL*
of
British
than
of
Continental
grotesques
of
the
period
.
All
the
*NL*
eight
were
different
from
each
other
.
A
beholder
was
convinced
that
*NL*
nothing
on
earth
could
be
more
hideous
than
those
he
saw
on
the
north
*NL*
side
until
he
went
round
to
the
south
.
Of
the
two
on
this
latter
*NL*
face
,
only
that
at
the
south-eastern
corner
concerns
the
story
.
It
*NL*
was
too
human
to
be
called
like
a
dragon
,
too
impish
to
be
like
a
*NL*
man
,
too
animal
to
be
like
a
fiend
,
and
not
enough
like
a
bird
to
be
*NL*
called
a
griffin
.
This
horrible
stone
entity
was
fashioned
as
if
*NL*
covered
with
a
wrinkled
hide
;
it
had
short
,
erect
ears
,
eyes
starting
*NL*
from
their
sockets
,
and
its
fingers
and
hands
were
seizing
the
*NL*
corners
of
its
mouth
,
which
they
thus
seemed
to
pull
open
to
give
*NL*
free
passage
to
the
water
it
vomited
.
The
lower
row
of
teeth
was
*NL*
quite
washed
away
,
though
the
upper
still
remained
.
Here
and
thus
,
*NL*
jutting
a
couple
of
feet
from
the
wall
against
which
its
feet
rested
*NL*
as
a
support
,
the
creature
had
for
four
hundred
years
laughed
at
the
*NL*
surrounding
landscape
,
voicelessly
in
dry
weather
,
and
in
wet
with
a
*NL*
gurgling
and
snorting
sound
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
slept
on
in
the
porch
,
and
the
rain
increased
outside
.
Presently
*NL*
the
gurgoyle
spat
.
In
due
time
a
small
stream
began
to
trickle
*NL*
through
the
seventy
feet
of
aerial
space
between
its
mouth
and
*NL*
the
ground
,
which
the
water-drops
smote
like
duckshot
in
their
*NL*
accelerated
velocity
.
The
stream
thickened
in
substance
,
and
*NL*
increased
in
power
,
gradually
spouting
further
and
yet
further
from
*NL*
the
side
of
the
tower
.
When
the
rain
fell
in
a
steady
and
ceaseless
*NL*
torrent
the
stream
dashed
downward
in
volumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
We
follow
its
course
to
the
ground
at
this
point
of
time
.
The
end
of
*NL*
the
liquid
parabola
has
come
forward
from
the
wall
,
has
advanced
over
*NL*
the
plinth
mouldings
,
over
a
heap
of
stones
,
over
the
marble
border
,
*NL*
into
the
midst
of
Fanny
Robin
's
grave
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
force
of
the
stream
had
,
until
very
lately
,
been
received
upon
*NL*
some
loose
stones
spread
thereabout
,
which
had
acted
as
a
shield
to
*NL*
the
soil
under
the
onset
.
These
during
the
summer
had
been
cleared
*NL*
from
the
ground
,
and
there
was
now
nothing
to
resist
the
down-fall
*NL*
but
the
bare
earth
.
For
several
years
the
stream
had
not
spouted
*NL*
so
far
from
the
tower
as
it
was
doing
on
this
night
,
and
such
a
*NL*
contingency
had
been
over-looked
.
Sometimes
this
obscure
corner
*NL*
received
no
inhabitant
for
the
space
of
two
or
three
years
,
and
*NL*
then
it
was
usually
but
a
pauper
,
a
poacher
,
or
other
sinner
of
*NL*
undignified
sins
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
persistent
torrent
from
the
gurgoyle
's
jaws
directed
all
its
*NL*
vengeance
into
the
grave
.
The
rich
tawny
mould
was
stirred
into
*NL*
motion
,
and
boiled
like
chocolate
.
The
water
accumulated
and
washed
*NL*
deeper
down
,
and
the
roar
of
the
pool
thus
formed
spread
into
the
*NL*
night
as
the
head
and
chief
among
other
noises
of
the
kind
created
*NL*
by
the
deluging
rain
.
The
flowers
so
carefully
planted
by
Fanny
's
*NL*
repentant
lover
began
to
move
and
writhe
in
their
bed
.
The
*NL*
winter-violets
turned
slowly
upside
down
,
and
became
a
mere
mat
of
*NL*
mud
.
Soon
the
snowdrop
and
other
bulbs
danced
in
the
boiling
mass
*NL*
like
ingredients
in
a
cauldron
.
Plants
of
the
tufted
species
were
*NL*
loosened
,
rose
to
the
surface
,
and
floated
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
did
not
awake
from
his
comfortless
sleep
till
it
was
broad
day
.
*NL*
Not
having
been
in
bed
for
two
nights
his
shoulders
felt
stiff
,
his
*NL*
feet
tender
,
and
his
head
heavy
.
He
remembered
his
position
,
arose
,
*NL*
shivered
,
took
the
spade
,
and
again
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rain
had
quite
ceased
,
and
the
sun
was
shining
through
the
*NL*
green
,
brown
,
and
yellow
leaves
,
now
sparkling
and
varnished
by
the
*NL*
raindrops
to
the
brightness
of
similar
effects
in
the
landscapes
of
*NL*
Ruysdael
and
Hobbema
,
and
full
of
all
those
infinite
beauties
that
*NL*
arise
from
the
union
of
water
and
colour
with
high
lights
.
The
air
*NL*
was
rendered
so
transparent
by
the
heavy
fall
of
rain
that
the
autumn
*NL*
hues
of
the
middle
distance
were
as
rich
as
those
near
at
hand
,
and
*NL*
the
remote
fields
intercepted
by
the
angle
of
the
tower
appeared
in
*NL*
the
same
plane
as
the
tower
itself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
entered
the
gravel
path
which
would
take
him
behind
the
tower
.
*NL*
The
path
,
instead
of
being
stony
as
it
had
been
the
night
before
,
was
*NL*
browned
over
with
a
thin
coating
of
mud
.
At
one
place
in
the
path
*NL*
he
saw
a
tuft
of
stringy
roots
washed
white
and
clean
as
a
bundle
*NL*
of
tendons
.
He
picked
it
up
--
surely
it
could
not
be
one
of
the
*NL*
primroses
he
had
planted
?
He
saw
a
bulb
,
another
,
and
another
as
*NL*
he
advanced
.
Beyond
doubt
they
were
the
crocuses
.
With
a
face
of
*NL*
perplexed
dismay
Troy
turned
the
corner
and
then
beheld
the
wreck
*NL*
the
stream
had
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pool
upon
the
grave
had
soaked
away
into
the
ground
,
and
in
its
*NL*
place
was
a
hollow
.
The
disturbed
earth
was
washed
over
the
grass
*NL*
and
pathway
in
the
guise
of
the
brown
mud
he
had
already
seen
,
and
it
*NL*
spotted
the
marble
tombstone
with
the
same
stains
.
Nearly
all
the
*NL*
flowers
were
washed
clean
out
of
the
ground
,
and
they
lay
,
roots
*NL*
upwards
,
on
the
spots
whither
they
had
been
splashed
by
the
stream
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
's
brow
became
heavily
contracted
.
He
set
his
teeth
closely
,
*NL*
and
his
compressed
lips
moved
as
those
of
one
in
great
pain
.
This
*NL*
singular
accident
,
by
a
strange
confluence
of
emotions
in
him
,
was
*NL*
felt
as
the
sharpest
sting
of
all
.
Troy
's
face
was
very
expressive
,
*NL*
and
any
observer
who
had
seen
him
now
would
hardly
have
believed
him
*NL*
to
be
a
man
who
had
laughed
,
and
sung
,
and
poured
love-trifles
into
*NL*
a
woman
's
ear
.
To
curse
his
miserable
lot
was
at
first
his
impulse
,
*NL*
but
even
that
lowest
stage
of
rebellion
needed
an
activity
whose
*NL*
absence
was
necessarily
antecedent
to
the
existence
of
the
morbid
*NL*
misery
which
wrung
him
.
The
sight
,
coming
as
it
did
,
superimposed
*NL*
upon
the
other
dark
scenery
of
the
previous
days
,
formed
a
sort
of
*NL*
climax
to
the
whole
panorama
,
and
it
was
more
than
he
could
endure
.
*NL*
Sanguine
by
nature
,
Troy
had
a
power
of
eluding
grief
by
simply
*NL*
adjourning
it
.
He
could
put
off
the
consideration
of
any
particular
*NL*
spectre
till
the
matter
had
become
old
and
softened
by
time
.
The
*NL*
planting
of
flowers
on
Fanny
's
grave
had
been
perhaps
but
a
species
*NL*
of
elusion
of
the
primary
grief
,
and
now
it
was
as
if
his
intention
*NL*
had
been
known
and
circumvented
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
,
Troy
,
as
he
stood
by
this
*NL*
dismantled
grave
,
wished
himself
another
man
.
It
is
seldom
that
a
*NL*
person
with
much
animal
spirit
does
not
feel
that
the
fact
of
his
*NL*
life
being
his
own
is
the
one
qualification
which
singles
it
out
as
a
*NL*
more
hopeful
life
than
that
of
others
who
may
actually
resemble
him
*NL*
in
every
particular
.
Troy
had
felt
,
in
his
transient
way
,
hundreds
*NL*
of
times
,
that
he
could
not
envy
other
people
their
condition
,
*NL*
because
the
possession
of
that
condition
would
have
necessitated
a
*NL*
different
personality
,
when
he
desired
no
other
than
his
own
.
He
had
*NL*
not
minded
the
peculiarities
of
his
birth
,
the
vicissitudes
of
his
*NL*
life
,
the
meteor-like
uncertainty
of
all
that
related
to
him
,
because
*NL*
these
appertained
to
the
hero
of
his
story
,
without
whom
there
would
*NL*
have
been
no
story
at
all
for
him
;
and
it
seemed
to
be
only
in
the
*NL*
nature
of
things
that
matters
would
right
themselves
at
some
proper
*NL*
date
and
wind
up
well
.
This
very
morning
the
illusion
completed
its
*NL*
disappearance
,
and
,
as
it
were
,
all
of
a
sudden
,
Troy
hated
himself
.
*NL*
The
suddenness
was
probably
more
apparent
than
real
.
A
coral
reef
*NL*
which
just
comes
short
of
the
ocean
surface
is
no
more
to
the
horizon
*NL*
than
if
it
had
never
been
begun
,
and
the
mere
finishing
stroke
is
*NL*
what
often
appears
to
create
an
event
which
has
long
been
potentially
*NL*
an
accomplished
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
and
meditated
--
a
miserable
man
.
Whither
should
he
*NL*
go
?
``
He
that
is
accursed
,
let
him
be
accursed
still
,
''
was
the
*NL*
pitiless
anathema
written
in
this
spoliated
effort
of
his
new-born
*NL*
solicitousness
.
A
man
who
has
spent
his
primal
strength
in
*NL*
journeying
in
one
direction
has
not
much
spirit
left
for
reversing
*NL*
his
course
.
Troy
had
,
since
yesterday
,
faintly
reversed
his
;
but
the
*NL*
merest
opposition
had
disheartened
him
.
To
turn
about
would
have
*NL*
been
hard
enough
under
the
greatest
providential
encouragement
;
but
*NL*
to
find
that
Providence
,
far
from
helping
him
into
a
new
course
,
or
*NL*
showing
any
wish
that
he
might
adopt
one
,
actually
jeered
his
first
*NL*
trembling
and
critical
attempt
in
that
kind
,
was
more
than
nature
*NL*
could
bear
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
slowly
withdrew
from
the
grave
.
He
did
not
attempt
to
fill
up
the
*NL*
hole
,
replace
the
flowers
,
or
do
anything
at
all
.
He
simply
threw
up
*NL*
his
cards
and
forswore
his
game
for
that
time
and
always
.
Going
out
*NL*
of
the
churchyard
silently
and
unobserved
--
none
of
the
villagers
*NL*
having
yet
risen
--
he
passed
down
some
fields
at
the
back
,
and
emerged
*NL*
just
as
secretly
upon
the
high
road
.
Shortly
afterwards
he
had
gone
*NL*
from
the
village
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
,
Bathsheba
remained
a
voluntary
prisoner
in
the
attic
.
The
*NL*
door
was
kept
locked
,
except
during
the
entries
and
exits
of
Liddy
,
*NL*
for
whom
a
bed
had
been
arranged
in
a
small
adjoining
room
.
The
*NL*
light
of
Troy
's
lantern
in
the
churchyard
was
noticed
about
ten
*NL*
o'clock
by
the
maid-servant
,
who
casually
glanced
from
the
window
in
*NL*
that
direction
whilst
taking
her
supper
,
and
she
called
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
attention
to
it
.
They
looked
curiously
at
the
phenomenon
for
a
time
,
*NL*
until
Liddy
was
sent
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
did
not
sleep
very
heavily
that
night
.
When
her
attendant
*NL*
was
unconscious
and
softly
breathing
in
the
next
room
,
the
mistress
*NL*
of
the
house
was
still
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
faint
gleam
*NL*
spreading
from
among
the
trees
--
not
in
a
steady
shine
,
but
blinking
*NL*
like
a
revolving
coast-light
,
though
this
appearance
failed
to
*NL*
suggest
to
her
that
a
person
was
passing
and
repassing
in
front
*NL*
of
it
.
Bathsheba
sat
here
till
it
began
to
rain
,
and
the
light
*NL*
vanished
,
when
she
withdrew
to
lie
restlessly
in
her
bed
and
re-enact
*NL*
in
a
worn
mind
the
lurid
scene
of
yesternight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
before
the
first
faint
sign
of
dawn
appeared
she
arose
again
,
*NL*
and
opened
the
window
to
obtain
a
full
breathing
of
the
new
morning
*NL*
air
,
the
panes
being
now
wet
with
trembling
tears
left
by
the
night
*NL*
rain
,
each
one
rounded
with
a
pale
lustre
caught
from
primrose-hued
*NL*
slashes
through
a
cloud
low
down
in
the
awakening
sky
.
From
the
*NL*
trees
came
the
sound
of
steady
dripping
upon
the
drifted
leaves
under
*NL*
them
,
and
from
the
direction
of
the
church
she
could
hear
another
*NL*
noise
--
peculiar
,
and
not
intermittent
like
the
rest
,
the
purl
of
*NL*
water
falling
into
a
pool
.
*NL*
*NL*
Liddy
knocked
at
eight
o'clock
,
and
Bathsheba
un-locked
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
heavy
rain
we
've
had
in
the
night
,
ma'am
!
''
said
Liddy
,
when
*NL*
her
inquiries
about
breakfast
had
been
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
heavy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
hear
the
strange
noise
from
the
churchyard
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
heard
one
strange
noise
.
I
've
been
thinking
it
must
have
been
the
*NL*
water
from
the
tower
spouts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
that
's
what
the
shepherd
was
saying
,
ma'am
.
He
's
now
gone
on
*NL*
to
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
Gabriel
has
been
here
this
morning
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
just
looked
in
in
passing
--
quite
in
his
old
way
,
which
I
*NL*
thought
he
had
left
off
lately
.
But
the
tower
spouts
used
to
spatter
*NL*
on
the
stones
,
and
we
are
puzzled
,
for
this
was
like
the
boiling
of
a
*NL*
pot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
being
able
to
read
,
think
,
or
work
,
Bathsheba
asked
Liddy
to
stay
*NL*
and
breakfast
with
her
.
The
tongue
of
the
more
childish
woman
still
*NL*
ran
upon
recent
events
.
``
Are
you
going
across
to
the
church
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
that
I
know
of
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
might
like
to
go
and
see
where
they
have
put
Fanny
.
*NL*
The
trees
hide
the
place
from
your
window
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
had
all
sorts
of
dreads
about
meeting
her
husband
.
``
Has
*NL*
Mr.
Troy
been
in
to-night
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
ma'am
;
I
think
he
's
gone
to
Budmouth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Budmouth
!
The
sound
of
the
word
carried
with
it
a
much
diminished
*NL*
perspective
of
him
and
his
deeds
;
there
were
thirteen
miles
interval
*NL*
betwixt
them
now
.
She
hated
questioning
Liddy
about
her
husband
's
*NL*
movements
,
and
indeed
had
hitherto
sedulously
avoided
doing
so
;
but
*NL*
now
all
the
house
knew
that
there
had
been
some
dreadful
disagreement
*NL*
between
them
,
and
it
was
futile
to
attempt
disguise
.
Bathsheba
had
*NL*
reached
a
stage
at
which
people
cease
to
have
any
appreciative
regard
*NL*
for
public
opinion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
makes
you
think
he
has
gone
there
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laban
Tall
saw
him
on
the
Budmouth
road
this
morning
before
*NL*
breakfast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
momentarily
relieved
of
that
wayward
heaviness
of
the
*NL*
past
twenty-four
hours
which
had
quenched
the
vitality
of
youth
in
*NL*
her
without
substituting
the
philosophy
of
maturer
years
,
and
she
*NL*
resolved
to
go
out
and
walk
a
little
way
.
So
when
breakfast
was
*NL*
over
,
she
put
on
her
bonnet
,
and
took
a
direction
towards
the
church
.
*NL*
It
was
nine
o'clock
,
and
the
men
having
returned
to
work
again
from
*NL*
their
first
meal
,
she
was
not
likely
to
meet
many
of
them
in
the
*NL*
road
.
Knowing
that
Fanny
had
been
laid
in
the
reprobates
'
quarter
*NL*
of
the
graveyard
,
called
in
the
parish
``
behind
church
,
''
which
was
*NL*
invisible
from
the
road
,
it
was
impossible
to
resist
the
impulse
to
*NL*
enter
and
look
upon
a
spot
which
,
from
nameless
feelings
,
she
at
*NL*
the
same
time
dreaded
to
see
.
She
had
been
unable
to
overcome
an
*NL*
impression
that
some
connection
existed
between
her
rival
and
the
*NL*
light
through
the
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
skirted
the
buttress
,
and
beheld
the
hole
and
the
tomb
,
its
*NL*
delicately
veined
surface
splashed
and
stained
just
as
Troy
had
seen
*NL*
it
and
left
it
two
hours
earlier
.
On
the
other
side
of
the
scene
*NL*
stood
Gabriel
.
His
eyes
,
too
,
were
fixed
on
the
tomb
,
and
her
*NL*
arrival
having
been
noiseless
,
she
had
not
as
yet
attracted
his
*NL*
attention
.
Bathsheba
did
not
at
once
perceive
that
the
grand
tomb
*NL*
and
the
disturbed
grave
were
Fanny
's
,
and
she
looked
on
both
sides
*NL*
and
around
for
some
humbler
mound
,
earthed
up
and
clodded
in
the
*NL*
usual
way
.
Then
her
eye
followed
Oak
's
,
and
she
read
the
words
with
*NL*
which
the
inscription
opened
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ERECTED
BY
FRANCIS
TROY
*NL*
IN
BELOVED
MEMORY
OF
*NL*
FANNY
ROBIN
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
saw
her
,
and
his
first
act
was
to
gaze
inquiringly
and
learn
how
*NL*
she
received
this
knowledge
of
the
authorship
of
the
work
,
which
to
*NL*
himself
had
caused
considerable
astonishment
.
But
such
discoveries
*NL*
did
not
much
affect
her
now
.
Emotional
convulsions
seemed
to
have
*NL*
become
the
commonplaces
of
her
history
,
and
she
bade
him
good
*NL*
morning
,
and
asked
him
to
fill
in
the
hole
with
the
spade
which
*NL*
was
standing
by
.
Whilst
Oak
was
doing
as
she
desired
,
Bathsheba
*NL*
collected
the
flowers
,
and
began
planting
them
with
that
sympathetic
*NL*
manipulation
of
roots
and
leaves
which
is
so
conspicuous
in
a
woman
's
*NL*
gardening
,
and
which
flowers
seem
to
understand
and
thrive
upon
.
She
*NL*
requested
Oak
to
get
the
churchwardens
to
turn
the
leadwork
at
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
gurgoyle
that
hung
gaping
down
upon
them
,
that
by
this
*NL*
means
the
stream
might
be
directed
sideways
,
and
a
repetition
of
the
*NL*
accident
prevented
.
Finally
,
with
the
superfluous
magnanimity
of
*NL*
a
woman
whose
narrower
instincts
have
brought
down
bitterness
upon
*NL*
her
instead
of
love
,
she
wiped
the
mud
spots
from
the
tomb
as
if
she
*NL*
rather
liked
its
words
than
otherwise
,
and
went
again
home
.

CHAPTER
XLVII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ADVENTURES
BY
THE
SHORE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
wandered
along
towards
the
south
.
A
composite
feeling
,
made
up
*NL*
of
disgust
with
the
,
to
him
,
humdrum
tediousness
of
a
farmer
's
life
,
*NL*
gloomy
images
of
her
who
lay
in
the
churchyard
,
remorse
,
and
a
*NL*
general
averseness
to
his
wife
's
society
,
impelled
him
to
seek
a
*NL*
home
in
any
place
on
earth
save
Weatherbury
.
The
sad
accessories
of
*NL*
Fanny
's
end
confronted
him
as
vivid
pictures
which
threatened
to
be
*NL*
indelible
,
and
made
life
in
Bathsheba
's
house
intolerable
.
At
three
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
he
found
himself
at
the
foot
of
a
slope
more
than
*NL*
a
mile
in
length
,
which
ran
to
the
ridge
of
a
range
of
hills
lying
*NL*
parallel
with
the
shore
,
and
forming
a
monotonous
barrier
between
*NL*
the
basin
of
cultivated
country
inland
and
the
wilder
scenery
of
the
*NL*
coast
.
Up
the
hill
stretched
a
road
nearly
straight
and
perfectly
*NL*
white
,
the
two
sides
approaching
each
other
in
a
gradual
taper
till
*NL*
they
met
the
sky
at
the
top
about
two
miles
off
.
Throughout
the
*NL*
length
of
this
narrow
and
irksome
inclined
plane
not
a
sign
of
life
*NL*
was
visible
on
this
garish
afternoon
.
Troy
toiled
up
the
road
with
a
*NL*
languor
and
depression
greater
than
any
he
had
experienced
for
many
a
*NL*
day
and
year
before
.
The
air
was
warm
and
muggy
,
and
the
top
seemed
*NL*
to
recede
as
he
approached
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
he
reached
the
summit
,
and
a
wide
and
novel
prospect
burst
*NL*
upon
him
with
an
effect
almost
like
that
of
the
Pacific
upon
Balboa
's
*NL*
gaze
.
The
broad
steely
sea
,
marked
only
by
faint
lines
,
which
had
*NL*
a
semblance
of
being
etched
thereon
to
a
degree
not
deep
enough
to
*NL*
disturb
its
general
evenness
,
stretched
the
whole
width
of
his
front
*NL*
and
round
to
the
right
,
where
,
near
the
town
and
port
of
Budmouth
,
*NL*
the
sun
bristled
down
upon
it
,
and
banished
all
colour
,
to
substitute
*NL*
in
its
place
a
clear
oily
polish
.
Nothing
moved
in
sky
,
land
,
or
*NL*
sea
,
except
a
frill
of
milkwhite
foam
along
the
nearer
angles
of
the
*NL*
shore
,
shreds
of
which
licked
the
contiguous
stones
like
tongues
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
descended
and
came
to
a
small
basin
of
sea
enclosed
by
the
cliffs
.
*NL*
Troy
's
nature
freshened
within
him
;
he
thought
he
would
rest
and
*NL*
bathe
here
before
going
farther
.
He
undressed
and
plunged
in
.
*NL*
Inside
the
cove
the
water
was
uninteresting
to
a
swimmer
,
being
*NL*
smooth
as
a
pond
,
and
to
get
a
little
of
the
ocean
swell
,
Troy
*NL*
presently
swam
between
the
two
projecting
spurs
of
rock
which
*NL*
formed
the
pillars
of
Hercules
to
this
miniature
Mediterranean
.
*NL*
Unfortunately
for
Troy
a
current
unknown
to
him
existed
outside
,
*NL*
which
,
unimportant
to
craft
of
any
burden
,
was
awkward
for
a
swimmer
*NL*
who
might
be
taken
in
it
unawares
.
Troy
found
himself
carried
to
*NL*
the
left
and
then
round
in
a
swoop
out
to
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
now
recollected
the
place
and
its
sinister
character
.
Many
*NL*
bathers
had
there
prayed
for
a
dry
death
from
time
to
time
,
and
,
like
*NL*
Gonzalo
also
,
had
been
unanswered
;
and
Troy
began
to
deem
it
possible
*NL*
that
he
might
be
added
to
their
number
.
Not
a
boat
of
any
kind
was
*NL*
at
present
within
sight
,
but
far
in
the
distance
Budmouth
lay
upon
*NL*
the
sea
,
as
it
were
quietly
regarding
his
efforts
,
and
beside
the
*NL*
town
the
harbour
showed
its
position
by
a
dim
meshwork
of
ropes
and
*NL*
spars
.
After
well-nigh
exhausting
himself
in
attempts
to
get
back
to
*NL*
the
mouth
of
the
cove
,
in
his
weakness
swimming
several
inches
deeper
*NL*
than
was
his
wont
,
keeping
up
his
breathing
entirely
by
his
nostrils
,
*NL*
turning
upon
his
back
a
dozen
times
over
,
swimming
_
en
papillon
_
,
and
*NL*
so
on
,
Troy
resolved
as
a
last
resource
to
tread
water
at
a
slight
*NL*
incline
,
and
so
endeavour
to
reach
the
shore
at
any
point
,
merely
*NL*
giving
himself
a
gentle
impetus
inwards
whilst
carried
on
in
the
*NL*
general
direction
of
the
tide
.
This
,
necessarily
a
slow
process
,
*NL*
he
found
to
be
not
altogether
so
difficult
,
and
though
there
was
no
*NL*
choice
of
a
landing-place
--
the
objects
on
shore
passing
by
him
in
a
*NL*
sad
and
slow
procession
--
he
perceptibly
approached
the
extremity
of
a
*NL*
spit
of
land
yet
further
to
the
right
,
now
well
defined
against
the
*NL*
sunny
portion
of
the
horizon
.
While
the
swimmer
's
eyes
were
fixed
*NL*
upon
the
spit
as
his
only
means
of
salvation
on
this
side
of
the
*NL*
Unknown
,
a
moving
object
broke
the
outline
of
the
extremity
,
and
*NL*
immediately
a
ship
's
boat
appeared
manned
with
several
sailor
lads
,
*NL*
her
bows
towards
the
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
Troy
's
vigour
spasmodically
revived
to
prolong
the
struggle
yet
a
*NL*
little
further
.
Swimming
with
his
right
arm
,
he
held
up
his
left
to
*NL*
hail
them
,
splashing
upon
the
waves
,
and
shouting
with
all
his
might
.
*NL*
From
the
position
of
the
setting
sun
his
white
form
was
distinctly
*NL*
visible
upon
the
now
deep-hued
bosom
of
the
sea
to
the
east
of
the
*NL*
boat
,
and
the
men
saw
him
at
once
.
Backing
their
oars
and
putting
*NL*
the
boat
about
,
they
pulled
towards
him
with
a
will
,
and
in
five
or
*NL*
six
minutes
from
the
time
of
his
first
halloo
,
two
of
the
sailors
*NL*
hauled
him
in
over
the
stern
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
formed
part
of
a
brig
's
crew
,
and
had
come
ashore
for
sand
.
*NL*
Lending
him
what
little
clothing
they
could
spare
among
them
as
a
*NL*
slight
protection
against
the
rapidly
cooling
air
,
they
agreed
to
*NL*
land
him
in
the
morning
;
and
without
further
delay
,
for
it
was
*NL*
growing
late
,
they
made
again
towards
the
roadstead
where
their
*NL*
vessel
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
night
drooped
slowly
upon
the
wide
watery
levels
in
front
;
*NL*
and
at
no
great
distance
from
them
,
where
the
shoreline
curved
round
,
*NL*
and
formed
a
long
riband
of
shade
upon
the
horizon
,
a
series
of
*NL*
points
of
yellow
light
began
to
start
into
existence
,
denoting
the
*NL*
spot
to
be
the
site
of
Budmouth
,
where
the
lamps
were
being
lighted
*NL*
along
the
parade
.
The
cluck
of
their
oars
was
the
only
sound
of
any
*NL*
distinctness
upon
the
sea
,
and
as
they
laboured
amid
the
thickening
*NL*
shades
the
lamp-lights
grew
larger
,
each
appearing
to
send
a
flaming
*NL*
sword
deep
down
into
the
waves
before
it
,
until
there
arose
,
among
*NL*
other
dim
shapes
of
the
kind
,
the
form
of
the
vessel
for
which
they
*NL*
were
bound
.

DOUBTS

DOUBTS

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
underwent
the
enlargement
of
her
husband
's
absence
from
*NL*
hours
to
days
with
a
slight
feeling
of
surprise
,
and
a
slight
feeling
*NL*
of
relief
;
yet
neither
sensation
rose
at
any
time
far
above
the
*NL*
level
commonly
designated
as
indifference
.
She
belonged
to
him
:
the
*NL*
certainties
of
that
position
were
so
well
defined
,
and
the
reasonable
*NL*
probabilities
of
its
issue
so
bounded
that
she
could
not
speculate
on
*NL*
contingencies
.
Taking
no
further
interest
in
herself
as
a
splendid
*NL*
woman
,
she
acquired
the
indifferent
feelings
of
an
outsider
in
*NL*
contemplating
her
probable
fate
as
a
singular
wretch
;
for
Bathsheba
*NL*
drew
herself
and
her
future
in
colours
that
no
reality
could
exceed
*NL*
for
darkness
.
Her
original
vigorous
pride
of
youth
had
sickened
,
*NL*
and
with
it
had
declined
all
her
anxieties
about
coming
years
,
since
*NL*
anxiety
recognizes
a
better
and
a
worse
alternative
,
and
Bathsheba
*NL*
had
made
up
her
mind
that
alternatives
on
any
noteworthy
scale
had
*NL*
ceased
for
her
.
Soon
,
or
later
--
and
that
not
very
late
--
her
husband
*NL*
would
be
home
again
.
And
then
the
days
of
their
tenancy
of
the
Upper
*NL*
Farm
would
be
numbered
.
There
had
originally
been
shown
by
the
agent
*NL*
to
the
estate
some
distrust
of
Bathsheba
's
tenure
as
James
Everdene
's
*NL*
successor
,
on
the
score
of
her
sex
,
and
her
youth
,
and
her
beauty
;
*NL*
but
the
peculiar
nature
of
her
uncle
's
will
,
his
own
frequent
*NL*
testimony
before
his
death
to
her
cleverness
in
such
a
pursuit
,
and
*NL*
her
vigorous
marshalling
of
the
numerous
flocks
and
herds
which
came
*NL*
suddenly
into
her
hands
before
negotiations
were
concluded
,
had
won
*NL*
confidence
in
her
powers
,
and
no
further
objections
had
been
raised
.
*NL*
She
had
latterly
been
in
great
doubt
as
to
what
the
legal
effects
of
*NL*
her
marriage
would
be
upon
her
position
;
but
no
notice
had
been
taken
*NL*
as
yet
of
her
change
of
name
,
and
only
one
point
was
clear
--
that
in
*NL*
the
event
of
her
own
or
her
husband
's
inability
to
meet
the
agent
at
*NL*
the
forthcoming
January
rent-day
,
very
little
consideration
would
be
*NL*
shown
,
and
,
for
that
matter
,
very
little
would
be
deserved
.
Once
out
*NL*
of
the
farm
,
the
approach
of
poverty
would
be
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hence
Bathsheba
lived
in
a
perception
that
her
purposes
were
broken
*NL*
off
.
She
was
not
a
woman
who
could
hope
on
without
good
materials
*NL*
for
the
process
,
differing
thus
from
the
less
far-sighted
and
*NL*
energetic
,
though
more
petted
ones
of
the
sex
,
with
whom
hope
goes
*NL*
on
as
a
sort
of
clockwork
which
the
merest
food
and
shelter
are
*NL*
sufficient
to
wind
up
;
and
perceiving
clearly
that
her
mistake
had
*NL*
been
a
fatal
one
,
she
accepted
her
position
,
and
waited
coldly
for
*NL*
the
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
Saturday
after
Troy
's
departure
she
went
to
Casterbridge
*NL*
alone
,
a
journey
she
had
not
before
taken
since
her
marriage
.
On
*NL*
this
Saturday
Bathsheba
was
passing
slowly
on
foot
through
the
crowd
*NL*
of
rural
business-men
gathered
as
usual
in
front
of
the
market-house
,
*NL*
who
were
as
usual
gazed
upon
by
the
burghers
with
feelings
that
*NL*
those
healthy
lives
were
dearly
paid
for
by
exclusion
from
possible
*NL*
aldermanship
,
when
a
man
,
who
had
apparently
been
following
her
,
*NL*
said
some
words
to
another
on
her
left
hand
.
Bathsheba
's
ears
were
*NL*
keen
as
those
of
any
wild
animal
,
and
she
distinctly
heard
what
the
*NL*
speaker
said
,
though
her
back
was
towards
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
looking
for
Mrs.
Troy
.
Is
that
she
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
's
the
young
lady
,
I
believe
,
''
said
the
the
person
*NL*
addressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
some
awkward
news
to
break
to
her
.
Her
husband
is
drowned
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
if
endowed
with
the
spirit
of
prophecy
,
Bathsheba
gasped
out
,
``
No
,
*NL*
it
is
not
true
;
it
can
not
be
true
!
''
Then
she
said
and
heard
no
more
.
*NL*
The
ice
of
self-command
which
had
latterly
gathered
over
her
was
*NL*
broken
,
and
the
currents
burst
forth
again
,
and
overwhelmed
her
.
A
*NL*
darkness
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
she
fell
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
not
to
the
ground
.
A
gloomy
man
,
who
had
been
observing
her
from
*NL*
under
the
portico
of
the
old
corn-exchange
when
she
passed
through
*NL*
the
group
without
,
stepped
quickly
to
her
side
at
the
moment
of
her
*NL*
exclamation
,
and
caught
her
in
his
arms
as
she
sank
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
''
said
Boldwood
,
looking
up
at
the
bringer
of
the
big
*NL*
news
,
as
he
supported
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
husband
was
drowned
this
week
while
bathing
in
Lulwind
Cove
.
*NL*
A
coastguardsman
found
his
clothes
,
and
brought
them
into
Budmouth
*NL*
yesterday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thereupon
a
strange
fire
lighted
up
Boldwood
's
eye
,
and
his
face
*NL*
flushed
with
the
suppressed
excitement
of
an
unutterable
thought
.
*NL*
Everybody
's
glance
was
now
centred
upon
him
and
the
unconscious
*NL*
Bathsheba
.
He
lifted
her
bodily
off
the
ground
,
and
smoothed
down
*NL*
the
folds
of
her
dress
as
a
child
might
have
taken
a
storm-beaten
*NL*
bird
and
arranged
its
ruffled
plumes
,
and
bore
her
along
the
*NL*
pavement
to
the
King
's
Arms
Inn
.
Here
he
passed
with
her
under
the
*NL*
archway
into
a
private
room
;
and
by
the
time
he
had
deposited
--
so
*NL*
lothly
--
the
precious
burden
upon
a
sofa
,
Bathsheba
had
opened
her
*NL*
eyes
.
Remembering
all
that
had
occurred
,
she
murmured
,
``
I
want
to
go
*NL*
home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
left
the
room
.
He
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
passage
to
*NL*
recover
his
senses
.
The
experience
had
been
too
much
for
his
*NL*
consciousness
to
keep
up
with
,
and
now
that
he
had
grasped
it
it
had
*NL*
gone
again
.
For
those
few
heavenly
,
golden
moments
she
had
been
in
*NL*
his
arms
.
What
did
it
matter
about
her
not
knowing
it
?
She
had
been
*NL*
close
to
his
breast
;
he
had
been
close
to
hers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
started
onward
again
,
and
sending
a
woman
to
her
,
went
out
to
*NL*
ascertain
all
the
facts
of
the
case
.
These
appeared
to
be
limited
to
*NL*
what
he
had
already
heard
.
He
then
ordered
her
horse
to
be
put
into
*NL*
the
gig
,
and
when
all
was
ready
returned
to
inform
her
.
He
found
*NL*
that
,
though
still
pale
and
unwell
,
she
had
in
the
meantime
sent
for
*NL*
the
Budmouth
man
who
brought
the
tidings
,
and
learnt
from
him
all
*NL*
there
was
to
know
.
*NL*
*NL*
Being
hardly
in
a
condition
to
drive
home
as
she
had
driven
to
town
,
*NL*
Boldwood
,
with
every
delicacy
of
manner
and
feeling
,
offered
to
get
*NL*
her
a
driver
,
or
to
give
her
a
seat
in
his
phaeton
,
which
was
more
*NL*
comfortable
than
her
own
conveyance
.
These
proposals
Bathsheba
*NL*
gently
declined
,
and
the
farmer
at
once
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
About
half-an-hour
later
she
invigorated
herself
by
an
effort
,
and
*NL*
took
her
seat
and
the
reins
as
usual
--
in
external
appearance
much
*NL*
as
if
nothing
had
happened
.
She
went
out
of
the
town
by
a
tortuous
*NL*
back
street
,
and
drove
slowly
along
,
unconscious
of
the
road
and
the
*NL*
scene
.
The
first
shades
of
evening
were
showing
themselves
when
*NL*
Bathsheba
reached
home
,
where
,
silently
alighting
and
leaving
the
*NL*
horse
in
the
hands
of
the
boy
,
she
proceeded
at
once
upstairs
.
*NL*
Liddy
met
her
on
the
landing
.
The
news
had
preceded
Bathsheba
to
*NL*
Weatherbury
by
half-an-hour
,
and
Liddy
looked
inquiringly
into
her
*NL*
mistress
's
face
.
Bathsheba
had
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
entered
her
bedroom
and
sat
by
the
window
,
and
thought
and
*NL*
thought
till
night
enveloped
her
,
and
the
extreme
lines
only
of
her
*NL*
shape
were
visible
.
Somebody
came
to
the
door
,
knocked
,
and
opened
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
is
it
,
Liddy
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
thinking
there
must
be
something
got
for
you
to
wear
,
''
said
*NL*
Liddy
,
with
hesitation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mourning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
suppose
there
must
be
something
done
for
poor
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
present
,
I
think
.
It
is
not
necessary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
's
still
alive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
know
that
?
''
said
Liddy
,
amazed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
it
.
But
would
n't
it
have
been
different
,
or
should
n't
*NL*
I
have
heard
more
,
or
would
n't
they
have
found
him
,
Liddy
?
--
or
--
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
how
it
is
,
but
death
would
have
been
different
from
how
*NL*
this
is
.
I
am
perfectly
convinced
that
he
is
still
alive
!

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
remained
firm
in
this
opinion
till
Monday
,
when
two
*NL*
circumstances
conjoined
to
shake
it
.
The
first
was
a
short
paragraph
*NL*
in
the
local
newspaper
,
which
,
beyond
making
by
a
methodizing
*NL*
pen
formidable
presumptive
evidence
of
Troy
's
death
by
drowning
,
*NL*
contained
the
important
testimony
of
a
young
Mr.
Barker
,
M.D.
,
of
*NL*
Budmouth
,
who
spoke
to
being
an
eyewitness
of
the
accident
,
in
a
*NL*
letter
to
the
editor
.
In
this
he
stated
that
he
was
passing
over
the
*NL*
cliff
on
the
remoter
side
of
the
cove
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
.
*NL*
At
that
time
he
saw
a
bather
carried
along
in
the
current
outside
the
*NL*
mouth
of
the
cove
,
and
guessed
in
an
instant
that
there
was
but
a
*NL*
poor
chance
for
him
unless
he
should
be
possessed
of
unusual
muscular
*NL*
powers
.
He
drifted
behind
a
projection
of
the
coast
,
and
Mr.
Barker
*NL*
followed
along
the
shore
in
the
same
direction
.
But
by
the
time
that
*NL*
he
could
reach
an
elevation
sufficiently
great
to
command
a
view
of
*NL*
the
sea
beyond
,
dusk
had
set
in
,
and
nothing
further
was
to
be
seen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
circumstance
was
the
arrival
of
his
clothes
,
when
it
became
*NL*
necessary
for
her
to
examine
and
identify
them
--
though
this
had
*NL*
virtually
been
done
long
before
by
those
who
inspected
the
letters
in
*NL*
his
pockets
.
It
was
so
evident
to
her
in
the
midst
of
her
agitation
*NL*
that
Troy
had
undressed
in
the
full
conviction
of
dressing
again
*NL*
almost
immediately
,
that
the
notion
that
anything
but
death
could
*NL*
have
prevented
him
was
a
perverse
one
to
entertain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Bathsheba
said
to
herself
that
others
were
assured
in
their
*NL*
opinion
;
strange
that
she
should
not
be
.
A
strange
reflection
*NL*
occurred
to
her
,
causing
her
face
to
flush
.
Suppose
that
Troy
had
*NL*
followed
Fanny
into
another
world
.
Had
he
done
this
intentionally
,
*NL*
yet
contrived
to
make
his
death
appear
like
an
accident
?
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
this
thought
of
how
the
apparent
might
differ
from
the
*NL*
real
--
made
vivid
by
her
bygone
jealousy
of
Fanny
,
and
the
remorse
*NL*
he
had
shown
that
night
--
did
not
blind
her
to
the
perception
of
a
*NL*
likelier
difference
,
less
tragic
,
but
to
herself
far
more
disastrous
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
alone
late
that
evening
beside
a
small
fire
,
and
much
calmed
*NL*
down
,
Bathsheba
took
Troy
's
watch
into
her
hand
,
which
had
been
*NL*
restored
to
her
with
the
rest
of
the
articles
belonging
to
him
.
She
*NL*
opened
the
case
as
he
had
opened
it
before
her
a
week
ago
.
There
was
*NL*
the
little
coil
of
pale
hair
which
had
been
as
the
fuze
to
this
great
*NL*
explosion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
hers
and
she
was
his
;
they
should
be
gone
together
,
''
she
*NL*
said
.
``
I
am
nothing
to
either
of
them
,
and
why
should
I
keep
*NL*
her
hair
?
''
She
took
it
in
her
hand
,
and
held
it
over
the
fire
.
*NL*
``
No
--
I
'll
not
burn
it
--
I
'll
keep
it
in
memory
of
her
,
poor
thing
!
''
*NL*
she
added
,
snatching
back
her
hand
.

CHAPTER
XLIX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
OAK
'S
ADVANCEMENT
--
A
GREAT
HOPE
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
later
autumn
and
the
winter
drew
on
apace
,
and
the
leaves
lay
*NL*
thick
upon
the
turf
of
the
glades
and
the
mosses
of
the
woods
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
having
previously
been
living
in
a
state
of
suspended
*NL*
feeling
which
was
not
suspense
,
now
lived
in
a
mood
of
quietude
which
*NL*
was
not
precisely
peacefulness
.
While
she
had
known
him
to
be
alive
*NL*
she
could
have
thought
of
his
death
with
equanimity
;
but
now
that
it
*NL*
might
be
she
had
lost
him
,
she
regretted
that
he
was
not
hers
still
.
*NL*
She
kept
the
farm
going
,
raked
in
her
profits
without
caring
keenly
*NL*
about
them
,
and
expended
money
on
ventures
because
she
had
done
so
*NL*
in
bygone
days
,
which
,
though
not
long
gone
by
,
seemed
infinitely
*NL*
removed
from
her
present
.
She
looked
back
upon
that
past
over
a
*NL*
great
gulf
,
as
if
she
were
now
a
dead
person
,
having
the
faculty
of
*NL*
meditation
still
left
in
her
,
by
means
of
which
,
like
the
mouldering
*NL*
gentlefolk
of
the
poet
's
story
,
she
could
sit
and
ponder
what
a
gift
*NL*
life
used
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
one
excellent
result
of
her
general
apathy
was
the
*NL*
long-delayed
installation
of
Oak
as
bailiff
;
but
he
having
virtually
*NL*
exercised
that
function
for
a
long
time
already
,
the
change
,
beyond
*NL*
the
substantial
increase
of
wages
it
brought
,
was
little
more
than
a
*NL*
nominal
one
addressed
to
the
outside
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
lived
secluded
and
inactive
.
Much
of
his
wheat
and
all
his
*NL*
barley
of
that
season
had
been
spoilt
by
the
rain
.
It
sprouted
,
*NL*
grew
into
intricate
mats
,
and
was
ultimately
thrown
to
the
pigs
in
*NL*
armfuls
.
The
strange
neglect
which
had
produced
this
ruin
and
waste
*NL*
became
the
subject
of
whispered
talk
among
all
the
people
round
;
and
*NL*
it
was
elicited
from
one
of
Boldwood
's
men
that
forgetfulness
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
for
he
had
been
reminded
of
the
danger
to
his
*NL*
corn
as
many
times
and
as
persistently
as
inferiors
dared
to
do
.
*NL*
The
sight
of
the
pigs
turning
in
disgust
from
the
rotten
ears
seemed
*NL*
to
arouse
Boldwood
,
and
he
one
evening
sent
for
Oak
.
Whether
it
*NL*
was
suggested
by
Bathsheba
's
recent
act
of
promotion
or
not
,
the
*NL*
farmer
proposed
at
the
interview
that
Gabriel
should
undertake
the
*NL*
superintendence
of
the
Lower
Farm
as
well
as
of
Bathsheba
's
,
because
*NL*
of
the
necessity
Boldwood
felt
for
such
aid
,
and
the
impossibility
*NL*
of
discovering
a
more
trustworthy
man
.
Gabriel
's
malignant
star
was
*NL*
assuredly
setting
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
when
she
learnt
of
this
proposal
--
for
Oak
was
obliged
to
*NL*
consult
her
--
at
first
languidly
objected
.
She
considered
that
the
*NL*
two
farms
together
were
too
extensive
for
the
observation
of
one
*NL*
man
.
Boldwood
,
who
was
apparently
determined
by
personal
rather
than
*NL*
commercial
reasons
,
suggested
that
Oak
should
be
furnished
with
a
*NL*
horse
for
his
sole
use
,
when
the
plan
would
present
no
difficulty
,
*NL*
the
two
farms
lying
side
by
side
.
Boldwood
did
not
directly
*NL*
communicate
with
her
during
these
negotiations
,
only
speaking
to
Oak
,
*NL*
who
was
the
go-between
throughout
.
All
was
harmoniously
arranged
at
*NL*
last
,
and
we
now
see
Oak
mounted
on
a
strong
cob
,
and
daily
trotting
*NL*
the
length
and
breadth
of
about
two
thousand
acres
in
a
cheerful
spirit
*NL*
of
surveillance
,
as
if
the
crops
all
belonged
to
him
--
the
actual
*NL*
mistress
of
the
one-half
and
the
master
of
the
other
,
sitting
in
*NL*
their
respective
homes
in
gloomy
and
sad
seclusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Out
of
this
there
arose
,
during
the
spring
succeeding
,
a
talk
in
the
*NL*
parish
that
Gabriel
Oak
was
feathering
his
nest
fast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whatever
d'ye
think
,
''
said
Susan
Tall
,
``
Gable
Oak
is
coming
it
quite
*NL*
the
dand
.
He
now
wears
shining
boots
with
hardly
a
hob
in
'em
,
two
*NL*
or
three
times
a-week
,
and
a
tall
hat
a-Sundays
,
and
'
a
hardly
knows
*NL*
the
name
of
smockfrock
.
When
I
see
people
strut
enough
to
be
cut
up
*NL*
into
bantam
cocks
,
I
stand
dormant
with
wonder
,
and
says
no
more
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
eventually
known
that
Gabriel
,
though
paid
a
fixed
wage
by
*NL*
Bathsheba
independent
of
the
fluctuations
of
agricultural
profits
,
*NL*
had
made
an
engagement
with
Boldwood
by
which
Oak
was
to
receive
a
*NL*
share
of
the
receipts
--
a
small
share
certainly
,
yet
it
was
money
of
*NL*
a
higher
quality
than
mere
wages
,
and
capable
of
expansion
in
a
way
*NL*
that
wages
were
not
.
Some
were
beginning
to
consider
Oak
a
``
near
''
*NL*
man
,
for
though
his
condition
had
thus
far
improved
,
he
lived
in
no
*NL*
better
style
than
before
,
occupying
the
same
cottage
,
paring
his
own
*NL*
potatoes
,
mending
his
stockings
,
and
sometimes
even
making
his
bed
*NL*
with
his
own
hands
.
But
as
Oak
was
not
only
provokingly
indifferent
*NL*
to
public
opinion
,
but
a
man
who
clung
persistently
to
old
habits
and
*NL*
usages
,
simply
because
they
were
old
,
there
was
room
for
doubt
as
to
*NL*
his
motives
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
great
hope
had
latterly
germinated
in
Boldwood
,
whose
unreasoning
*NL*
devotion
to
Bathsheba
could
only
be
characterized
as
a
fond
madness
*NL*
which
neither
time
nor
circumstance
,
evil
nor
good
report
,
could
*NL*
weaken
or
destroy
.
This
fevered
hope
had
grown
up
again
like
a
grain
*NL*
of
mustard-seed
during
the
quiet
which
followed
the
hasty
conjecture
*NL*
that
Troy
was
drowned
.
He
nourished
it
fearfully
,
and
almost
shunned
*NL*
the
contemplation
of
it
in
earnest
,
lest
facts
should
reveal
the
*NL*
wildness
of
the
dream
.
Bathsheba
having
at
last
been
persuaded
to
*NL*
wear
mourning
,
her
appearance
as
she
entered
the
church
in
that
*NL*
guise
was
in
itself
a
weekly
addition
to
his
faith
that
a
time
was
*NL*
coming
--
very
far
off
perhaps
,
yet
surely
nearing
--
when
his
waiting
on
*NL*
events
should
have
its
reward
.
How
long
he
might
have
to
wait
he
had
*NL*
not
yet
closely
considered
.
What
he
would
try
to
recognize
was
that
*NL*
the
severe
schooling
she
had
been
subjected
to
had
made
Bathsheba
*NL*
much
more
considerate
than
she
had
formerly
been
of
the
feelings
of
*NL*
others
,
and
he
trusted
that
,
should
she
be
willing
at
any
time
in
the
*NL*
future
to
marry
any
man
at
all
,
that
man
would
be
himself
.
There
was
*NL*
a
substratum
of
good
feeling
in
her
:
her
self-reproach
for
the
injury
*NL*
she
had
thoughtlessly
done
him
might
be
depended
upon
now
to
a
much
*NL*
greater
extent
than
before
her
infatuation
and
disappointment
.
It
*NL*
would
be
possible
to
approach
her
by
the
channel
of
her
good
nature
,
*NL*
and
to
suggest
a
friendly
businesslike
compact
between
them
for
*NL*
fulfilment
at
some
future
day
,
keeping
the
passionate
side
of
his
*NL*
desire
entirely
out
of
her
sight
.
Such
was
Boldwood
's
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
eyes
of
the
middle-aged
,
Bathsheba
was
perhaps
additionally
*NL*
charming
just
now
.
Her
exuberance
of
spirit
was
pruned
down
;
the
*NL*
original
phantom
of
delight
had
shown
herself
to
be
not
too
bright
*NL*
for
human
nature
's
daily
food
,
and
she
had
been
able
to
enter
this
*NL*
second
poetical
phase
without
losing
much
of
the
first
in
the
*NL*
process
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
return
from
a
two
months
'
visit
to
her
old
aunt
at
*NL*
Norcombe
afforded
the
impassioned
and
yearning
farmer
a
pretext
for
*NL*
inquiring
directly
after
her
--
now
possibly
in
the
ninth
month
of
her
*NL*
widowhood
--
and
endeavouring
to
get
a
notion
of
her
state
of
mind
*NL*
regarding
him
.
This
occurred
in
the
middle
of
the
haymaking
,
and
*NL*
Boldwood
contrived
to
be
near
Liddy
,
who
was
assisting
in
the
fields
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
to
see
you
out
of
doors
,
Lydia
,
''
he
said
pleasantly
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
simpered
,
and
wondered
in
her
heart
why
he
should
speak
so
*NL*
frankly
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
Mrs.
Troy
is
quite
well
after
her
long
absence
,
''
he
*NL*
continued
,
in
a
manner
expressing
that
the
coldest-hearted
neighbour
*NL*
could
scarcely
say
less
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
is
quite
well
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
cheerful
,
I
suppose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
cheerful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fearful
,
did
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
.
I
merely
said
she
was
cheerful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tells
you
all
her
affairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Some
of
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Troy
puts
much
confidence
in
you
,
Lydia
,
and
very
wisely
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
do
,
sir
.
I
've
been
with
her
all
through
her
troubles
,
and
was
*NL*
with
her
at
the
time
of
Mr.
Troy
's
going
and
all
.
And
if
she
were
*NL*
to
marry
again
I
expect
I
should
bide
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
promises
that
you
shall
--
quite
natural
,
''
said
the
strategic
*NL*
lover
,
throbbing
throughout
him
at
the
presumption
which
Liddy
's
*NL*
words
appeared
to
warrant
--
that
his
darling
had
thought
of
*NL*
re-marriage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
she
does
n't
promise
it
exactly
.
I
merely
judge
on
my
own
*NL*
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
I
understand
.
When
she
alludes
to
the
possibility
of
*NL*
marrying
again
,
you
conclude
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
do
allude
to
it
,
sir
,
''
said
Liddy
,
thinking
how
very
*NL*
stupid
Mr.
Boldwood
was
getting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
not
,
''
he
returned
hastily
,
his
hope
falling
again
.
``
You
*NL*
need
n't
take
quite
such
long
reaches
with
your
rake
,
Lydia
--
short
*NL*
and
quick
ones
are
best
.
Well
,
perhaps
,
as
she
is
absolute
mistress
*NL*
again
now
,
it
is
wise
of
her
to
resolve
never
to
give
up
her
*NL*
freedom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
mistress
did
certainly
once
say
,
though
not
seriously
,
that
she
*NL*
supposed
she
might
marry
again
at
the
end
of
seven
years
from
last
*NL*
year
,
if
she
cared
to
risk
Mr.
Troy
's
coming
back
and
claiming
her
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
six
years
from
the
present
time

Said
that
she
might

She
*NL*
might
marry
at
once
in
every
reasonable
person
's
opinion
,
whatever
*NL*
the
lawyers
may
say
to
the
contrary

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
to
ask
them
?
''
said
Liddy
,
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
''
said
Boldwood
,
growing
red
.
``
Liddy
,
you
need
n't
stay
here
*NL*
a
minute
later
than
you
wish
,
so
Mr.
Oak
says
.
I
am
now
going
on
a
*NL*
little
farther
.
Good-afternoon

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
away
vexed
with
himself
,
and
ashamed
of
having
for
this
one
*NL*
time
in
his
life
done
anything
which
could
be
called
underhand
.
Poor
*NL*
Boldwood
had
no
more
skill
in
finesse
than
a
battering-ram
,
and
he
*NL*
was
uneasy
with
a
sense
of
having
made
himself
to
appear
stupid
and
,
*NL*
what
was
worse
,
mean
.
But
he
had
,
after
all
,
lighted
upon
one
fact
*NL*
by
way
of
repayment
.
It
was
a
singularly
fresh
and
fascinating
fact
,
*NL*
and
though
not
without
its
sadness
it
was
pertinent
and
real
.
In
*NL*
little
more
than
six
years
from
this
time
Bathsheba
might
certainly
*NL*
marry
him
.
There
was
something
definite
in
that
hope
,
for
admitting
*NL*
that
there
might
have
been
no
deep
thought
in
her
words
to
Liddy
*NL*
about
marriage
,
they
showed
at
least
her
creed
on
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
pleasant
notion
was
now
continually
in
his
mind
.
Six
years
were
*NL*
a
long
time
,
but
how
much
shorter
than
never
,
the
idea
he
had
for
so
*NL*
long
been
obliged
to
endure
!
Jacob
had
served
twice
seven
years
for
*NL*
Rachel
:
what
were
six
for
such
a
woman
as
this
?
He
tried
to
like
the
*NL*
notion
of
waiting
for
her
better
than
that
of
winning
her
at
once
.
*NL*
Boldwood
felt
his
love
to
be
so
deep
and
strong
and
eternal
,
that
*NL*
it
was
possible
she
had
never
yet
known
its
full
volume
,
and
this
*NL*
patience
in
delay
would
afford
him
an
opportunity
of
giving
sweet
*NL*
proof
on
the
point
.
He
would
annihilate
the
six
years
of
his
life
as
*NL*
if
they
were
minutes
--
so
little
did
he
value
his
time
on
earth
beside
*NL*
her
love
.
He
would
let
her
see
,
all
those
six
years
of
intangible
*NL*
ethereal
courtship
,
how
little
care
he
had
for
anything
but
as
it
*NL*
bore
upon
the
consummation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
the
early
and
the
late
summer
brought
round
the
week
in
*NL*
which
Greenhill
Fair
was
held
.
This
fair
was
frequently
attended
by
*NL*
the
folk
of
Weatherbury
.

*NL*
*NL*
THE
SHEEP
FAIR
--
TROY
TOUCHES
HIS
WIFE
'S
HAND
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Greenhill
was
the
Nijni
Novgorod
of
South
Wessex
;
and
the
busiest
,
*NL*
merriest
,
noisiest
day
of
the
whole
statute
number
was
the
day
of
*NL*
the
sheep
fair
.
This
yearly
gathering
was
upon
the
summit
of
a
*NL*
hill
which
retained
in
good
preservation
the
remains
of
an
ancient
*NL*
earthwork
,
consisting
of
a
huge
rampart
and
entrenchment
of
an
oval
*NL*
form
encircling
the
top
of
the
hill
,
though
somewhat
broken
down
here
*NL*
and
there
.
To
each
of
the
two
chief
openings
on
opposite
sides
a
*NL*
winding
road
ascended
,
and
the
level
green
space
of
ten
or
fifteen
*NL*
acres
enclosed
by
the
bank
was
the
site
of
the
fair
.
A
few
permanent
*NL*
erections
dotted
the
spot
,
but
the
majority
of
visitors
patronized
*NL*
canvas
alone
for
resting
and
feeding
under
during
the
time
of
their
*NL*
sojourn
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shepherds
who
attended
with
their
flocks
from
long
distances
started
*NL*
from
home
two
or
three
days
,
or
even
a
week
,
before
the
fair
,
driving
*NL*
their
charges
a
few
miles
each
day
--
not
more
than
ten
or
twelve
--
and
*NL*
resting
them
at
night
in
hired
fields
by
the
wayside
at
previously
*NL*
chosen
points
,
where
they
fed
,
having
fasted
since
morning
.
The
*NL*
shepherd
of
each
flock
marched
behind
,
a
bundle
containing
his
kit
*NL*
for
the
week
strapped
upon
his
shoulders
,
and
in
his
hand
his
crook
,
*NL*
which
he
used
as
the
staff
of
his
pilgrimage
.
Several
of
the
sheep
*NL*
would
get
worn
and
lame
,
and
occasionally
a
lambing
occurred
on
the
*NL*
road
.
To
meet
these
contingencies
,
there
was
frequently
provided
,
to
*NL*
accompany
the
flocks
from
the
remoter
points
,
a
pony
and
waggon
into
*NL*
which
the
weakly
ones
were
taken
for
the
remainder
of
the
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Weatherbury
Farms
,
however
,
were
no
such
long
distance
from
the
*NL*
hill
,
and
those
arrangements
were
not
necessary
in
their
case
.
But
*NL*
the
large
united
flocks
of
Bathsheba
and
Farmer
Boldwood
formed
a
*NL*
valuable
and
imposing
multitude
which
demanded
much
attention
,
and
*NL*
on
this
account
Gabriel
,
in
addition
to
Boldwood
's
shepherd
and
Cain
*NL*
Ball
,
accompanied
them
along
the
way
,
through
the
decayed
old
town
of
*NL*
Kingsbere
,
and
upward
to
the
plateau
,
--
old
George
the
dog
of
course
*NL*
behind
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
autumn
sun
slanted
over
Greenhill
this
morning
and
lighted
*NL*
the
dewy
flat
upon
its
crest
,
nebulous
clouds
of
dust
were
to
be
seen
*NL*
floating
between
the
pairs
of
hedges
which
streaked
the
wide
prospect
*NL*
around
in
all
directions
.
These
gradually
converged
upon
the
base
of
*NL*
the
hill
,
and
the
flocks
became
individually
visible
,
climbing
the
*NL*
serpentine
ways
which
led
to
the
top
.
Thus
,
in
a
slow
procession
,
*NL*
they
entered
the
opening
to
which
the
roads
tended
,
multitude
after
*NL*
multitude
,
horned
and
hornless
--
blue
flocks
and
red
flocks
,
buff
*NL*
flocks
and
brown
flocks
,
even
green
and
salmon-tinted
flocks
,
*NL*
according
to
the
fancy
of
the
colourist
and
custom
of
the
farm
.
*NL*
Men
were
shouting
,
dogs
were
barking
,
with
greatest
animation
,
but
*NL*
the
thronging
travellers
in
so
long
a
journey
had
grown
nearly
*NL*
indifferent
to
such
terrors
,
though
they
still
bleated
piteously
at
*NL*
the
unwontedness
of
their
experiences
,
a
tall
shepherd
rising
here
*NL*
and
there
in
the
midst
of
them
,
like
a
gigantic
idol
amid
a
crowd
*NL*
of
prostrate
devotees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
mass
of
sheep
in
the
fair
consisted
of
South
Downs
and
the
*NL*
old
Wessex
horned
breeds
;
to
the
latter
class
Bathsheba
's
and
Farmer
*NL*
Boldwood
's
mainly
belonged
.
These
filed
in
about
nine
o'clock
,
their
*NL*
vermiculated
horns
lopping
gracefully
on
each
side
of
their
cheeks
in
*NL*
geometrically
perfect
spirals
,
a
small
pink
and
white
ear
nestling
*NL*
under
each
horn
.
Before
and
behind
came
other
varieties
,
perfect
*NL*
leopards
as
to
the
full
rich
substance
of
their
coats
,
and
only
*NL*
lacking
the
spots
.
There
were
also
a
few
of
the
Oxfordshire
breed
,
*NL*
whose
wool
was
beginning
to
curl
like
a
child
's
flaxen
hair
,
though
*NL*
surpassed
in
this
respect
by
the
effeminate
Leicesters
,
which
were
in
*NL*
turn
less
curly
than
the
Cotswolds
.
But
the
most
picturesque
by
far
*NL*
was
a
small
flock
of
Exmoors
,
which
chanced
to
be
there
this
year
.
*NL*
Their
pied
faces
and
legs
,
dark
and
heavy
horns
,
tresses
of
wool
*NL*
hanging
round
their
swarthy
foreheads
,
quite
relieved
the
monotony
*NL*
of
the
flocks
in
that
quarter
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
these
bleating
,
panting
,
and
weary
thousands
had
entered
and
were
*NL*
penned
before
the
morning
had
far
advanced
,
the
dog
belonging
to
each
*NL*
flock
being
tied
to
the
corner
of
the
pen
containing
it
.
Alleys
for
*NL*
pedestrians
intersected
the
pens
,
which
soon
became
crowded
with
*NL*
buyers
and
sellers
from
far
and
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
another
part
of
the
hill
an
altogether
different
scene
began
*NL*
to
force
itself
upon
the
eye
towards
midday
.
A
circular
tent
,
of
*NL*
exceptional
newness
and
size
,
was
in
course
of
erection
here
.
As
*NL*
the
day
drew
on
,
the
flocks
began
to
change
hands
,
lightening
the
*NL*
shepherd
's
responsibilities
;
and
they
turned
their
attention
to
*NL*
this
tent
and
inquired
of
a
man
at
work
there
,
whose
soul
seemed
*NL*
concentrated
on
tying
a
bothering
knot
in
no
time
,
what
was
going
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Royal
Hippodrome
Performance
of
Turpin
's
Ride
to
York
and
the
*NL*
Death
of
Black
Bess
,
''
replied
the
man
promptly
,
without
turning
his
*NL*
eyes
or
leaving
off
tying
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
the
tent
was
completed
the
band
struck
up
highly
*NL*
stimulating
harmonies
,
and
the
announcement
was
publicly
made
,
Black
*NL*
Bess
standing
in
a
conspicuous
position
on
the
outside
,
as
a
living
*NL*
proof
,
if
proof
were
wanted
,
of
the
truth
of
the
oracular
utterances
*NL*
from
the
stage
over
which
the
people
were
to
enter
.
These
were
so
*NL*
convinced
by
such
genuine
appeals
to
heart
and
understanding
both
*NL*
that
they
soon
began
to
crowd
in
abundantly
,
among
the
foremost
being
*NL*
visible
Jan
Coggan
and
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
who
were
holiday
keeping
*NL*
here
to-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
great
ruffen
pushing
me
!
''
screamed
a
woman
in
front
of
*NL*
Jan
over
her
shoulder
at
him
when
the
rush
was
at
its
fiercest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
can
I
help
pushing
ye
when
the
folk
behind
push
me
?
''
said
*NL*
Coggan
,
in
a
deprecating
tone
,
turning
his
head
towards
the
aforesaid
*NL*
folk
as
far
as
he
could
without
turning
his
body
,
which
was
jammed
as
*NL*
in
a
vice
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
silence
;
then
the
drums
and
trumpets
again
sent
forth
*NL*
their
echoing
notes
.
The
crowd
was
again
ecstasied
,
and
gave
another
*NL*
lurch
in
which
Coggan
and
Poorgrass
were
again
thrust
by
those
behind
*NL*
upon
the
women
in
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
that
helpless
feymels
should
be
at
the
mercy
of
such
ruffens
!
''
*NL*
exclaimed
one
of
these
ladies
again
,
as
she
swayed
like
a
reed
shaken
*NL*
by
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
''
said
Coggan
,
appealing
in
an
earnest
voice
to
the
public
at
*NL*
large
as
it
stood
clustered
about
his
shoulder-blades
,
``
did
ye
ever
*NL*
hear
such
onreasonable
woman
as
that
?
Upon
my
carcase
,
neighbours
,
*NL*
if
I
could
only
get
out
of
this
cheese-wring
,
the
damn
women
might
*NL*
eat
the
show
for
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
ye
lose
yer
temper
,
Jan
!
''
implored
Joseph
Poorgrass
,
in
a
*NL*
whisper
.
``
They
might
get
their
men
to
murder
us
,
for
I
think
by
the
*NL*
shine
of
their
eyes
that
they
be
a
sinful
form
of
womankind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jan
held
his
tongue
,
as
if
he
had
no
objection
to
be
pacified
to
*NL*
please
a
friend
,
and
they
gradually
reached
the
foot
of
the
ladder
,
*NL*
Poorgrass
being
flattened
like
a
jumping-jack
,
and
the
sixpence
,
for
*NL*
admission
,
which
he
had
got
ready
half-an-hour
earlier
,
having
become
*NL*
so
reeking
hot
in
the
tight
squeeze
of
his
excited
hand
that
the
*NL*
woman
in
spangles
,
brazen
rings
set
with
glass
diamonds
,
and
with
*NL*
chalked
face
and
shoulders
,
who
took
the
money
of
him
,
hastily
*NL*
dropped
it
again
from
a
fear
that
some
trick
had
been
played
to
burn
*NL*
her
fingers
.
So
they
all
entered
,
and
the
cloth
of
the
tent
,
to
the
*NL*
eyes
of
an
observer
on
the
outside
,
became
bulged
into
innumerable
*NL*
pimples
such
as
we
observe
on
a
sack
of
potatoes
,
caused
by
the
*NL*
various
human
heads
,
backs
,
and
elbows
at
high
pressure
within
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
rear
of
the
large
tent
there
were
two
small
dressing-tents
.
*NL*
One
of
these
,
alloted
to
the
male
performers
,
was
partitioned
into
*NL*
halves
by
a
cloth
;
and
in
one
of
the
divisions
there
was
sitting
on
*NL*
the
grass
,
pulling
on
a
pair
of
jack-boots
,
a
young
man
whom
we
*NL*
instantly
recognise
as
Sergeant
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
's
appearance
in
this
position
may
be
briefly
accounted
for
.
The
*NL*
brig
aboard
which
he
was
taken
in
Budmouth
Roads
was
about
to
start
*NL*
on
a
voyage
,
though
somewhat
short
of
hands
.
Troy
read
the
articles
*NL*
and
joined
,
but
before
they
sailed
a
boat
was
despatched
across
the
*NL*
bay
to
Lulwind
cove
;
as
he
had
half
expected
,
his
clothes
were
gone
.
*NL*
He
ultimately
worked
his
passage
to
the
United
States
,
where
he
made
*NL*
a
precarious
living
in
various
towns
as
Professor
of
Gymnastics
,
*NL*
Sword
Exercise
,
Fencing
,
and
Pugilism
.
A
few
months
were
sufficient
*NL*
to
give
him
a
distaste
for
this
kind
of
life
.
There
was
a
certain
*NL*
animal
form
of
refinement
in
his
nature
;
and
however
pleasant
a
*NL*
strange
condition
might
be
whilst
privations
were
easily
warded
off
,
*NL*
it
was
disadvantageously
coarse
when
money
was
short
.
There
was
ever
*NL*
present
,
too
,
the
idea
that
he
could
claim
a
home
and
its
comforts
*NL*
did
he
but
chose
to
return
to
England
and
Weatherbury
Farm
.
Whether
*NL*
Bathsheba
thought
him
dead
was
a
frequent
subject
of
curious
*NL*
conjecture
.
To
England
he
did
return
at
last
;
but
the
fact
of
*NL*
drawing
nearer
to
Weatherbury
abstracted
its
fascinations
,
and
his
*NL*
intention
to
enter
his
old
groove
at
the
place
became
modified
.
It
*NL*
was
with
gloom
he
considered
on
landing
at
Liverpool
that
if
he
*NL*
were
to
go
home
his
reception
would
be
of
a
kind
very
unpleasant
*NL*
to
contemplate
;
for
what
Troy
had
in
the
way
of
emotion
was
an
*NL*
occasional
fitful
sentiment
which
sometimes
caused
him
as
much
*NL*
inconvenience
as
emotion
of
a
strong
and
healthy
kind
.
Bathsheba
was
*NL*
not
a
woman
to
be
made
a
fool
of
,
or
a
woman
to
suffer
in
silence
;
*NL*
and
how
could
he
endure
existence
with
a
spirited
wife
to
whom
at
*NL*
first
entering
he
would
be
beholden
for
food
and
lodging
?
Moreover
,
*NL*
it
was
not
at
all
unlikely
that
his
wife
would
fail
at
her
farming
,
*NL*
if
she
had
not
already
done
so
;
and
he
would
then
become
liable
for
*NL*
her
maintenance
:
and
what
a
life
such
a
future
of
poverty
with
her
*NL*
would
be
,
the
spectre
of
Fanny
constantly
between
them
,
harrowing
*NL*
his
temper
and
embittering
her
words
!
Thus
,
for
reasons
touching
on
*NL*
distaste
,
regret
,
and
shame
commingled
,
he
put
off
his
return
from
*NL*
day
to
day
,
and
would
have
decided
to
put
it
off
altogether
if
he
*NL*
could
have
found
anywhere
else
the
ready-made
establishment
which
*NL*
existed
for
him
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
time
--
the
July
preceding
the
September
in
which
we
find
*NL*
at
Greenhill
Fair
--
he
fell
in
with
a
travelling
circus
which
was
*NL*
performing
in
the
outskirts
of
a
northern
town
.
Troy
introduced
*NL*
himself
to
the
manager
by
taming
a
restive
horse
of
the
troupe
,
*NL*
hitting
a
suspended
apple
with
a
pistol-bullet
fired
from
the
*NL*
animal
's
back
when
in
full
gallop
,
and
other
feats
.
For
his
*NL*
merits
in
these
--
all
more
or
less
based
upon
his
experiences
as
a
*NL*
dragoon-guardsman
--
Troy
was
taken
into
the
company
,
and
the
play
*NL*
of
Turpin
was
prepared
with
a
view
to
his
personation
of
the
chief
*NL*
character
.
Troy
was
not
greatly
elated
by
the
appreciative
spirit
in
*NL*
which
he
was
undoubtedly
treated
,
but
he
thought
the
engagement
might
*NL*
afford
him
a
few
weeks
for
consideration
.
It
was
thus
carelessly
,
*NL*
and
without
having
formed
any
definite
plan
for
the
future
,
that
Troy
*NL*
found
himself
at
Greenhill
Fair
with
the
rest
of
the
company
on
this
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
now
the
mild
autumn
sun
got
lower
,
and
in
front
of
the
pavilion
*NL*
the
following
incident
had
taken
place
.
Bathsheba
--
who
was
driven
*NL*
to
the
fair
that
day
by
her
odd
man
Poorgrass
--
had
,
like
every
one
*NL*
else
,
read
or
heard
the
announcement
that
Mr.
Francis
,
the
Great
*NL*
Cosmopolitan
Equestrian
and
Roughrider
,
would
enact
the
part
of
*NL*
Turpin
,
and
she
was
not
yet
too
old
and
careworn
to
be
without
a
*NL*
little
curiosity
to
see
him
.
This
particular
show
was
by
far
the
*NL*
largest
and
grandest
in
the
fair
,
a
horde
of
little
shows
grouping
*NL*
themselves
under
its
shade
like
chickens
around
a
hen
.
The
crowd
had
*NL*
passed
in
,
and
Boldwood
,
who
had
been
watching
all
the
day
for
an
*NL*
opportunity
of
speaking
to
her
,
seeing
her
comparatively
isolated
,
*NL*
came
up
to
her
side
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
the
sheep
have
done
well
to-day
,
Mrs.
Troy
?
''
he
said
,
*NL*
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
thank
you
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
colour
springing
up
in
the
*NL*
centre
of
her
cheeks
.
``
I
was
fortunate
enough
to
sell
them
all
just
*NL*
as
we
got
upon
the
hill
,
so
we
had
n't
to
pen
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
you
are
entirely
at
leisure
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
except
that
I
have
to
see
one
more
dealer
in
two
hours
'
time
:
*NL*
otherwise
I
should
be
going
home
.
He
was
looking
at
this
large
tent
*NL*
and
the
announcement
.
Have
you
ever
seen
the
play
of
`
Turpin
's
Ride
*NL*
to
York
'
?
Turpin
was
a
real
man
,
was
he
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
perfectly
true
--
all
of
it
.
Indeed
,
I
think
I
've
heard
Jan
*NL*
Coggan
say
that
a
relation
of
his
knew
Tom
King
,
Turpin
's
friend
,
*NL*
quite
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Coggan
is
rather
given
to
strange
stories
connected
with
his
*NL*
relations
,
we
must
remember
.
I
hope
they
can
all
be
believed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
;
we
know
Coggan
.
But
Turpin
is
true
enough
.
You
have
*NL*
never
seen
it
played
,
I
suppose
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
.
I
was
not
allowed
to
go
into
these
places
when
I
was
young
.
*NL*
Hark
!
What
's
that
prancing
?
How
they
shout
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Black
Bess
just
started
off
,
I
suppose
.
Am
I
right
in
supposing
*NL*
you
would
like
to
see
the
performance
,
Mrs.
Troy
?
Please
excuse
my
*NL*
mistake
,
if
it
is
one
;
but
if
you
would
like
to
,
I
'll
get
a
seat
for
*NL*
you
with
pleasure
.
''
Perceiving
that
she
hesitated
,
he
added
,
``
I
*NL*
myself
shall
not
stay
to
see
it
:
I
've
seen
it
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Bathsheba
did
care
a
little
to
see
the
show
,
and
had
only
*NL*
withheld
her
feet
from
the
ladder
because
she
feared
to
go
in
alone
.
*NL*
She
had
been
hoping
that
Oak
might
appear
,
whose
assistance
in
such
*NL*
cases
was
always
accepted
as
an
inalienable
right
,
but
Oak
was
*NL*
nowhere
to
be
seen
;
and
hence
it
was
that
she
said
,
``
Then
if
you
will
*NL*
just
look
in
first
,
to
see
if
there
's
room
,
I
think
I
will
go
in
for
*NL*
a
minute
or
two
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
a
short
time
after
this
Bathsheba
appeared
in
the
tent
with
*NL*
Boldwood
at
her
elbow
,
who
,
taking
her
to
a
``
reserved
''
seat
,
again
*NL*
withdrew
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
feature
consisted
of
one
raised
bench
in
a
very
conspicuous
*NL*
part
of
the
circle
,
covered
with
red
cloth
,
and
floored
with
a
piece
*NL*
of
carpet
,
and
Bathsheba
immediately
found
,
to
her
confusion
,
that
*NL*
she
was
the
single
reserved
individual
in
the
tent
,
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
crowded
spectators
,
one
and
all
,
standing
on
their
legs
on
the
*NL*
borders
of
the
arena
,
where
they
got
twice
as
good
a
view
of
the
*NL*
performance
for
half
the
money
.
Hence
as
many
eyes
were
turned
upon
*NL*
her
,
enthroned
alone
in
this
place
of
honour
,
against
a
scarlet
*NL*
background
,
as
upon
the
ponies
and
clown
who
were
engaged
in
*NL*
preliminary
exploits
in
the
centre
,
Turpin
not
having
yet
appeared
.
*NL*
Once
there
,
Bathsheba
was
forced
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
remain
:
*NL*
she
sat
down
,
spreading
her
skirts
with
some
dignity
over
the
*NL*
unoccupied
space
on
each
side
of
her
,
and
giving
a
new
and
feminine
*NL*
aspect
to
the
pavilion
.
In
a
few
minutes
she
noticed
the
fat
red
*NL*
nape
of
Coggan
's
neck
among
those
standing
just
below
her
,
and
Joseph
*NL*
Poorgrass
's
saintly
profile
a
little
further
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
was
shadowy
with
a
peculiar
shade
.
The
strange
luminous
*NL*
semi-opacities
of
fine
autumn
afternoons
and
eves
intensified
into
*NL*
Rembrandt
effects
the
few
yellow
sunbeams
which
came
through
holes
*NL*
and
divisions
in
the
canvas
,
and
spirted
like
jets
of
gold-dust
*NL*
across
the
dusky
blue
atmosphere
of
haze
pervading
the
tent
,
until
*NL*
they
alighted
on
inner
surfaces
of
cloth
opposite
,
and
shone
like
*NL*
little
lamps
suspended
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
,
on
peeping
from
his
dressing-tent
through
a
slit
for
a
*NL*
reconnoitre
before
entering
,
saw
his
unconscious
wife
on
high
before
*NL*
him
as
described
,
sitting
as
queen
of
the
tournament
.
He
started
*NL*
back
in
utter
confusion
,
for
although
his
disguise
effectually
*NL*
concealed
his
personality
,
he
instantly
felt
that
she
would
be
sure
*NL*
to
recognize
his
voice
.
He
had
several
times
during
the
day
thought
*NL*
of
the
possibility
of
some
Weatherbury
person
or
other
appearing
and
*NL*
recognizing
him
;
but
he
had
taken
the
risk
carelessly
.
If
they
see
*NL*
me
,
let
them
,
he
had
said
.
But
here
was
Bathsheba
in
her
own
person
;
*NL*
and
the
reality
of
the
scene
was
so
much
intenser
than
any
of
his
*NL*
prefigurings
that
he
felt
he
had
not
half
enough
considered
the
*NL*
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
so
charming
and
fair
that
his
cool
mood
about
Weatherbury
*NL*
people
was
changed
.
He
had
not
expected
her
to
exercise
this
power
*NL*
over
him
in
the
twinkling
of
an
eye
.
Should
he
go
on
,
and
care
*NL*
nothing
?
He
could
not
bring
himself
to
do
that
.
Beyond
a
politic
*NL*
wish
to
remain
unknown
,
there
suddenly
arose
in
him
now
a
sense
of
*NL*
shame
at
the
possibility
that
his
attractive
young
wife
,
who
already
*NL*
despised
him
,
should
despise
him
more
by
discovering
him
in
so
mean
a
*NL*
condition
after
so
long
a
time
.
He
actually
blushed
at
the
thought
,
*NL*
and
was
vexed
beyond
measure
that
his
sentiments
of
dislike
towards
*NL*
Weatherbury
should
have
led
him
to
dally
about
the
country
in
this
*NL*
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Troy
was
never
more
clever
than
when
absolutely
at
his
wit
's
end
.
*NL*
He
hastily
thrust
aside
the
curtain
dividing
his
own
little
dressing
*NL*
space
from
that
of
the
manager
and
proprietor
,
who
now
appeared
as
*NL*
the
individual
called
Tom
King
as
far
down
as
his
waist
,
and
as
the
*NL*
aforesaid
respectable
manager
thence
to
his
toes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
devil
to
pay
!
''
said
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
there
's
a
blackguard
creditor
in
the
tent
I
do
n't
want
to
see
,
*NL*
who
'll
discover
me
and
nab
me
as
sure
as
Satan
if
I
open
my
mouth
.
*NL*
What
's
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
appear
now
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
play
must
proceed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
give
out
that
Turpin
has
got
a
bad
cold
,
and
ca
n't
speak
his
*NL*
part
,
but
that
he
'll
perform
it
just
the
same
without
speaking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
proprietor
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyhow
,
play
or
no
play
,
I
wo
n't
open
my
mouth
,
''
said
Troy
,
firmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
let
me
see
.
I
tell
you
how
we
'll
manage
,
''
said
the
*NL*
other
,
who
perhaps
felt
it
would
be
extremely
awkward
to
offend
his
*NL*
leading
man
just
at
this
time
.
``
I
wo
n't
tell
'em
anything
about
your
*NL*
keeping
silence
;
go
on
with
the
piece
and
say
nothing
,
doing
what
*NL*
you
can
by
a
judicious
wink
now
and
then
,
and
a
few
indomitable
nods
*NL*
in
the
heroic
places
,
you
know
.
They
'll
never
find
out
that
the
*NL*
speeches
are
omitted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
seemed
feasible
enough
,
for
Turpin
's
speeches
were
not
many
or
*NL*
long
,
the
fascination
of
the
piece
lying
entirely
in
the
action
;
and
*NL*
accordingly
the
play
began
,
and
at
the
appointed
time
Black
Bess
*NL*
leapt
into
the
grassy
circle
amid
the
plaudits
of
the
spectators
.
*NL*
At
the
turnpike
scene
,
where
Bess
and
Turpin
are
hotly
pursued
at
*NL*
midnight
by
the
officers
,
and
the
half-awake
gatekeeper
in
his
*NL*
tasselled
nightcap
denies
that
any
horseman
has
passed
,
Coggan
*NL*
uttered
a
broad-chested
``
Well
done
!
''
which
could
be
heard
all
over
*NL*
the
fair
above
the
bleating
,
and
Poorgrass
smiled
delightedly
with
a
*NL*
nice
sense
of
dramatic
contrast
between
our
hero
,
who
coolly
leaps
*NL*
the
gate
,
and
halting
justice
in
the
form
of
his
enemies
,
who
must
*NL*
needs
pull
up
cumbersomely
and
wait
to
be
let
through
.
At
the
death
*NL*
of
Tom
King
,
he
could
not
refrain
from
seizing
Coggan
by
the
hand
,
*NL*
and
whispering
,
with
tears
in
his
eyes
,
``
Of
course
he
's
not
really
*NL*
shot
,
Jan
--
only
seemingly
!
''
And
when
the
last
sad
scene
came
on
,
and
*NL*
the
body
of
the
gallant
and
faithful
Bess
had
to
be
carried
out
on
a
*NL*
shutter
by
twelve
volunteers
from
among
the
spectators
,
nothing
could
*NL*
restrain
Poorgrass
from
lending
a
hand
,
exclaiming
,
as
he
asked
*NL*
Jan
to
join
him
,
``
Twill
be
something
to
tell
of
at
Warren
's
in
*NL*
future
years
,
Jan
,
and
hand
down
to
our
children
.
''
For
many
a
year
*NL*
in
Weatherbury
,
Joseph
told
,
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
had
had
*NL*
experiences
in
his
time
,
that
he
touched
with
his
own
hand
the
hoof
*NL*
of
Bess
as
she
lay
upon
the
board
upon
his
shoulder
.
If
,
as
some
*NL*
thinkers
hold
,
immortality
consists
in
being
enshrined
in
others
'
*NL*
memories
,
then
did
Black
Bess
become
immortal
that
day
if
she
never
*NL*
had
done
so
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Meanwhile
Troy
had
added
a
few
touches
to
his
ordinary
make-up
for
*NL*
the
character
,
the
more
effectually
to
disguise
himself
,
and
though
*NL*
he
had
felt
faint
qualms
on
first
entering
,
the
metamorphosis
*NL*
effected
by
judiciously
``
lining
''
his
face
with
a
wire
rendered
him
*NL*
safe
from
the
eyes
of
Bathsheba
and
her
men
.
Nevertheless
,
he
was
*NL*
relieved
when
it
was
got
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
second
performance
in
the
evening
,
and
the
tent
was
*NL*
lighted
up
.
Troy
had
taken
his
part
very
quietly
this
time
,
*NL*
venturing
to
introduce
a
few
speeches
on
occasion
;
and
was
just
*NL*
concluding
it
when
,
whilst
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
circle
*NL*
contiguous
to
the
first
row
of
spectators
,
he
observed
within
a
*NL*
yard
of
him
the
eye
of
a
man
darted
keenly
into
his
side
features
.
*NL*
Troy
hastily
shifted
his
position
,
after
having
recognized
in
the
*NL*
scrutineer
the
knavish
bailiff
Pennyways
,
his
wife
's
sworn
enemy
,
*NL*
who
still
hung
about
the
outskirts
of
Weatherbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
first
Troy
resolved
to
take
no
notice
and
abide
by
circumstances
.
*NL*
That
he
had
been
recognized
by
this
man
was
highly
probable
;
yet
*NL*
there
was
room
for
a
doubt
.
Then
the
great
objection
he
had
felt
to
*NL*
allowing
news
of
his
proximity
to
precede
him
to
Weatherbury
in
the
*NL*
event
of
his
return
,
based
on
a
feeling
that
knowledge
of
his
present
*NL*
occupation
would
discredit
him
still
further
in
his
wife
's
eyes
,
*NL*
returned
in
full
force
.
Moreover
,
should
he
resolve
not
to
return
at
*NL*
all
,
a
tale
of
his
being
alive
and
being
in
the
neighbourhood
would
*NL*
be
awkward
;
and
he
was
anxious
to
acquire
a
knowledge
of
his
wife
's
*NL*
temporal
affairs
before
deciding
which
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
dilemma
Troy
at
once
went
out
to
reconnoitre
.
It
occurred
*NL*
to
him
that
to
find
Pennyways
,
and
make
a
friend
of
him
if
possible
,
*NL*
would
be
a
very
wise
act
.
He
had
put
on
a
thick
beard
borrowed
from
*NL*
the
establishment
,
and
in
this
he
wandered
about
the
fair-field
.
It
*NL*
was
now
almost
dark
,
and
respectable
people
were
getting
their
carts
*NL*
and
gigs
ready
to
go
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
largest
refreshment
booth
in
the
fair
was
provided
by
an
*NL*
innkeeper
from
a
neighbouring
town
.
This
was
considered
an
*NL*
unexceptionable
place
for
obtaining
the
necessary
food
and
rest
:
*NL*
Host
Trencher
-LRB-
as
he
was
jauntily
called
by
the
local
newspaper
-RRB-
*NL*
being
a
substantial
man
of
high
repute
for
catering
through
all
the
*NL*
country
round
.
The
tent
was
divided
into
first
and
second-class
*NL*
compartments
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
first-class
division
was
a
yet
*NL*
further
enclosure
for
the
most
exclusive
,
fenced
off
from
the
body
*NL*
of
the
tent
by
a
luncheon-bar
,
behind
which
the
host
himself
stood
*NL*
bustling
about
in
white
apron
and
shirt-sleeves
,
and
looking
as
if
*NL*
he
had
never
lived
anywhere
but
under
canvas
all
his
life
.
In
these
*NL*
penetralia
were
chairs
and
a
table
,
which
,
on
candles
being
lighted
,
*NL*
made
quite
a
cozy
and
luxurious
show
,
with
an
urn
,
plated
tea
and
*NL*
coffee
pots
,
china
teacups
,
and
plum
cakes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
stood
at
the
entrance
to
the
booth
,
where
a
gipsy-woman
was
*NL*
frying
pancakes
over
a
little
fire
of
sticks
and
selling
them
at
a
*NL*
penny
a-piece
,
and
looked
over
the
heads
of
the
people
within
.
He
*NL*
could
see
nothing
of
Pennyways
,
but
he
soon
discerned
Bathsheba
*NL*
through
an
opening
into
the
reserved
space
at
the
further
end
.
Troy
*NL*
thereupon
retreated
,
went
round
the
tent
into
the
darkness
,
and
*NL*
listened
.
He
could
hear
Bathsheba
's
voice
immediately
inside
the
*NL*
canvas
;
she
was
conversing
with
a
man
.
A
warmth
overspread
his
*NL*
face
:
surely
she
was
not
so
unprincipled
as
to
flirt
in
a
fair
!
*NL*
He
wondered
if
,
then
,
she
reckoned
upon
his
death
as
an
absolute
*NL*
certainty
.
To
get
at
the
root
of
the
matter
,
Troy
took
a
penknife
*NL*
from
his
pocket
and
softly
made
two
little
cuts
crosswise
in
the
*NL*
cloth
,
which
,
by
folding
back
the
corners
left
a
hole
the
size
of
a
*NL*
wafer
.
Close
to
this
he
placed
his
face
,
withdrawing
it
again
in
a
*NL*
movement
of
surprise
;
for
his
eye
had
been
within
twelve
inches
of
*NL*
the
top
of
Bathsheba
's
head
.
It
was
too
near
to
be
convenient
.
He
*NL*
made
another
hole
a
little
to
one
side
and
lower
down
,
in
a
shaded
*NL*
place
beside
her
chair
,
from
which
it
was
easy
and
safe
to
survey
*NL*
her
by
looking
horizontally
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
took
in
the
scene
completely
now
.
She
was
leaning
back
,
sipping
*NL*
a
cup
of
tea
that
she
held
in
her
hand
,
and
the
owner
of
the
male
*NL*
voice
was
Boldwood
,
who
had
apparently
just
brought
the
cup
to
her
,
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
being
in
a
negligent
mood
,
leant
so
idly
against
the
*NL*
canvas
that
it
was
pressed
to
the
shape
of
her
shoulder
,
and
she
was
,
*NL*
in
fact
,
as
good
as
in
Troy
's
arms
;
and
he
was
obliged
to
keep
his
*NL*
breast
carefully
backward
that
she
might
not
feel
its
warmth
through
*NL*
the
cloth
as
he
gazed
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
found
unexpected
chords
of
feeling
to
be
stirred
again
within
*NL*
him
as
they
had
been
stirred
earlier
in
the
day
.
She
was
handsome
*NL*
as
ever
,
and
she
was
his
.
It
was
some
minutes
before
he
could
*NL*
counteract
his
sudden
wish
to
go
in
,
and
claim
her
.
Then
he
thought
*NL*
how
the
proud
girl
who
had
always
looked
down
upon
him
even
whilst
it
*NL*
was
to
love
him
,
would
hate
him
on
discovering
him
to
be
a
strolling
*NL*
player
.
Were
he
to
make
himself
known
,
that
chapter
of
his
life
*NL*
must
at
all
risks
be
kept
for
ever
from
her
and
from
the
Weatherbury
*NL*
people
,
or
his
name
would
be
a
byword
throughout
the
parish
.
He
*NL*
would
be
nicknamed
``
Turpin
''
as
long
as
he
lived
.
Assuredly
before
*NL*
he
could
claim
her
these
few
past
months
of
his
existence
must
be
*NL*
entirely
blotted
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shall
I
get
you
another
cup
before
you
start
,
ma'am
?
''
said
Farmer
*NL*
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
``
But
I
must
be
going
at
once
.
It
was
*NL*
great
neglect
in
that
man
to
keep
me
waiting
here
till
so
late
.
I
*NL*
should
have
gone
two
hours
ago
,
if
it
had
not
been
for
him
.
I
had
no
*NL*
idea
of
coming
in
here
;
but
there
's
nothing
so
refreshing
as
a
cup
of
*NL*
tea
,
though
I
should
never
have
got
one
if
you
had
n't
helped
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
scrutinized
her
cheek
as
lit
by
the
candles
,
and
watched
each
*NL*
varying
shade
thereon
,
and
the
white
shell-like
sinuosities
of
her
*NL*
little
ear
.
She
took
out
her
purse
and
was
insisting
to
Boldwood
on
*NL*
paying
for
her
tea
for
herself
,
when
at
this
moment
Pennyways
entered
*NL*
the
tent
.
Troy
trembled
:
here
was
his
scheme
for
respectability
*NL*
endangered
at
once
.
He
was
about
to
leave
his
hole
of
espial
,
*NL*
attempt
to
follow
Pennyways
,
and
find
out
if
the
ex-bailiff
had
*NL*
recognized
him
,
when
he
was
arrested
by
the
conversation
,
and
found
*NL*
he
was
too
late
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excuse
me
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Pennyways
;
``
I
've
some
private
information
*NL*
for
your
ear
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
hear
it
now
,
''
she
said
,
coldly
.
That
Bathsheba
could
not
*NL*
endure
this
man
was
evident
;
in
fact
,
he
was
continually
coming
to
*NL*
her
with
some
tale
or
other
,
by
which
he
might
creep
into
favour
at
*NL*
the
expense
of
persons
maligned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
write
it
down
,
''
said
Pennyways
,
confidently
.
He
stooped
over
*NL*
the
table
,
pulled
a
leaf
from
a
warped
pocket-book
,
and
wrote
upon
*NL*
the
paper
,
in
a
round
hand
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
YOUR
HUSBAND
IS
HERE
.
I
'VE
SEEN
HIM
.
WHO
'S
THE
FOOL
NOW
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
he
folded
small
,
and
handed
towards
her
.
Bathsheba
would
not
*NL*
read
it
;
she
would
not
even
put
out
her
hand
to
take
it
.
Pennyways
,
*NL*
then
,
with
a
laugh
of
derision
,
tossed
it
into
her
lap
,
and
,
turning
*NL*
away
,
left
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
words
and
action
of
Pennyways
,
Troy
,
though
he
had
not
been
*NL*
able
to
see
what
the
ex-bailiff
wrote
,
had
not
a
moment
's
doubt
that
*NL*
the
note
referred
to
him
.
Nothing
that
he
could
think
of
could
be
*NL*
done
to
check
the
exposure
.
``
Curse
my
luck
!
''
he
whispered
,
and
*NL*
added
imprecations
which
rustled
in
the
gloom
like
a
pestilent
wind
.
*NL*
Meanwhile
Boldwood
said
,
taking
up
the
note
from
her
lap
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
wish
to
read
it
,
Mrs.
Troy
?
If
not
,
I
'll
destroy
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
well
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
carelessly
,
``
perhaps
it
is
unjust
not
to
*NL*
read
it
;
but
I
can
guess
what
it
is
about
.
He
wants
me
to
recommend
*NL*
him
,
or
it
is
to
tell
me
of
some
little
scandal
or
another
connected
*NL*
with
my
work-people
.
He
's
always
doing
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
held
the
note
in
her
right
hand
.
Boldwood
handed
towards
*NL*
her
a
plate
of
cut
bread-and-butter
;
when
,
in
order
to
take
a
slice
,
*NL*
she
put
the
note
into
her
left
hand
,
where
she
was
still
holding
*NL*
the
purse
,
and
then
allowed
her
hand
to
drop
beside
her
close
to
*NL*
the
canvas
.
The
moment
had
come
for
saving
his
game
,
and
Troy
*NL*
impulsively
felt
that
he
would
play
the
card
.
For
yet
another
time
*NL*
he
looked
at
the
fair
hand
,
and
saw
the
pink
finger-tips
,
and
the
*NL*
blue
veins
of
the
wrist
,
encircled
by
a
bracelet
of
coral
chippings
*NL*
which
she
wore
:
how
familiar
it
all
was
to
him
!
Then
,
with
the
*NL*
lightning
action
in
which
he
was
such
an
adept
,
he
noiselessly
*NL*
slipped
his
hand
under
the
bottom
of
the
tent-cloth
,
which
was
far
*NL*
from
being
pinned
tightly
down
,
lifted
it
a
little
way
,
keeping
his
*NL*
eye
to
the
hole
,
snatched
the
note
from
her
fingers
,
dropped
the
*NL*
canvas
,
and
ran
away
in
the
gloom
towards
the
bank
and
ditch
,
smiling
*NL*
at
the
scream
of
astonishment
which
burst
from
her
.
Troy
then
slid
*NL*
down
on
the
outside
of
the
rampart
,
hastened
round
in
the
bottom
of
*NL*
the
entrenchment
to
a
distance
of
a
hundred
yards
,
ascended
again
,
*NL*
and
crossed
boldly
in
a
slow
walk
towards
the
front
entrance
of
*NL*
the
tent
.
His
object
was
now
to
get
to
Pennyways
,
and
prevent
a
*NL*
repetition
of
the
announcement
until
such
time
as
he
should
choose
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
reached
the
tent
door
,
and
standing
among
the
groups
there
*NL*
gathered
,
looked
anxiously
for
Pennyways
,
evidently
not
wishing
to
*NL*
make
himself
prominent
by
inquiring
for
him
.
One
or
two
men
were
*NL*
speaking
of
a
daring
attempt
that
had
just
been
made
to
rob
a
young
*NL*
lady
by
lifting
the
canvas
of
the
tent
beside
her
.
It
was
supposed
*NL*
that
the
rogue
had
imagined
a
slip
of
paper
which
she
held
in
her
*NL*
hand
to
be
a
bank
note
,
for
he
had
seized
it
,
and
made
off
with
*NL*
it
,
leaving
her
purse
behind
.
His
chagrin
and
disappointment
at
*NL*
discovering
its
worthlessness
would
be
a
good
joke
,
it
was
said
.
*NL*
However
,
the
occurrence
seemed
to
have
become
known
to
few
,
for
it
*NL*
had
not
interrupted
a
fiddler
,
who
had
lately
begun
playing
by
the
*NL*
door
of
the
tent
,
nor
the
four
bowed
old
men
with
grim
countenances
*NL*
and
walking-sticks
in
hand
,
who
were
dancing
``
Major
Malley
's
Reel
''
*NL*
to
the
tune
.
Behind
these
stood
Pennyways
.
Troy
glided
up
to
him
,
*NL*
beckoned
,
and
whispered
a
few
words
;
and
with
a
mutual
glance
of
*NL*
concurrence
the
two
men
went
into
the
night
together
.

CHAPTER
LI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BATHSHEBA
TALKS
WITH
HER
OUTRIDER
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
arrangement
for
getting
back
again
to
Weatherbury
had
been
that
*NL*
Oak
should
take
the
place
of
Poorgrass
in
Bathsheba
's
conveyance
and
*NL*
drive
her
home
,
it
being
discovered
late
in
the
afternoon
that
Joseph
*NL*
was
suffering
from
his
old
complaint
,
a
multiplying
eye
,
and
was
,
*NL*
therefore
,
hardly
trustworthy
as
coachman
and
protector
to
a
woman
.
*NL*
But
Oak
had
found
himself
so
occupied
,
and
was
full
of
so
many
*NL*
cares
relative
to
those
portions
of
Boldwood
's
flocks
that
were
not
*NL*
disposed
of
,
that
Bathsheba
,
without
telling
Oak
or
anybody
,
resolved
*NL*
to
drive
home
herself
,
as
she
had
many
times
done
from
Casterbridge
*NL*
Market
,
and
trust
to
her
good
angel
for
performing
the
journey
*NL*
unmolested
.
But
having
fallen
in
with
Farmer
Boldwood
accidentally
*NL*
-LRB-
on
her
part
at
least
-RRB-
at
the
refreshment-tent
,
she
found
it
*NL*
impossible
to
refuse
his
offer
to
ride
on
horseback
beside
her
as
*NL*
escort
.
It
had
grown
twilight
before
she
was
aware
,
but
Boldwood
*NL*
assured
her
that
there
was
no
cause
for
uneasiness
,
as
the
moon
*NL*
would
be
up
in
half-an-hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Immediately
after
the
incident
in
the
tent
,
she
had
risen
to
*NL*
go
--
now
absolutely
alarmed
and
really
grateful
for
her
old
lover
's
*NL*
protection
--
though
regretting
Gabriel
's
absence
,
whose
company
she
*NL*
would
have
much
preferred
,
as
being
more
proper
as
well
as
more
*NL*
pleasant
,
since
he
was
her
own
managing-man
and
servant
.
This
,
*NL*
however
,
could
not
be
helped
;
she
would
not
,
on
any
consideration
,
*NL*
treat
Boldwood
harshly
,
having
once
already
ill-used
him
,
and
the
*NL*
moon
having
risen
,
and
the
gig
being
ready
,
she
drove
across
the
*NL*
hilltop
in
the
wending
way
's
which
led
downwards
--
to
oblivious
*NL*
obscurity
,
as
it
seemed
,
for
the
moon
and
the
hill
it
flooded
with
*NL*
light
were
in
appearance
on
a
level
,
the
rest
of
the
world
lying
as
*NL*
a
vast
shady
concave
between
them
.
Boldwood
mounted
his
horse
,
and
*NL*
followed
in
close
attendance
behind
.
Thus
they
descended
into
the
*NL*
lowlands
,
and
the
sounds
of
those
left
on
the
hill
came
like
voices
*NL*
from
the
sky
,
and
the
lights
were
as
those
of
a
camp
in
heaven
.
They
*NL*
soon
passed
the
merry
stragglers
in
the
immediate
vicinity
of
the
*NL*
hill
,
traversed
Kingsbere
,
and
got
upon
the
high
road
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
keen
instincts
of
Bathsheba
had
perceived
that
the
farmer
's
*NL*
staunch
devotion
to
herself
was
still
undiminished
,
and
she
*NL*
sympathized
deeply
.
The
sight
had
quite
depressed
her
this
evening
;
*NL*
had
reminded
her
of
her
folly
;
she
wished
anew
,
as
she
had
wished
*NL*
many
months
ago
,
for
some
means
of
making
reparation
for
her
fault
.
*NL*
Hence
her
pity
for
the
man
who
so
persistently
loved
on
to
his
own
*NL*
injury
and
permanent
gloom
had
betrayed
Bathsheba
into
an
injudicious
*NL*
considerateness
of
manner
,
which
appeared
almost
like
tenderness
,
*NL*
and
gave
new
vigour
to
the
exquisite
dream
of
a
Jacob
's
seven
years
*NL*
service
in
poor
Boldwood
's
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
soon
found
an
excuse
for
advancing
from
his
position
in
the
rear
,
*NL*
and
rode
close
by
her
side
.
They
had
gone
two
or
three
miles
in
*NL*
the
moonlight
,
speaking
desultorily
across
the
wheel
of
her
gig
*NL*
concerning
the
fair
,
farming
,
Oak
's
usefulness
to
them
both
,
and
*NL*
other
indifferent
subjects
,
when
Boldwood
said
suddenly
and
simply
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Troy
,
you
will
marry
again
some
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
point-blank
query
unmistakably
confused
her
,
and
it
was
not
till
*NL*
a
minute
or
more
had
elapsed
that
she
said
,
``
I
have
not
seriously
*NL*
thought
of
any
such
subject
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
quite
understand
that
.
Yet
your
late
husband
has
been
dead
nearly
*NL*
one
year
,
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
that
his
death
was
never
absolutely
proved
,
and
may
not
*NL*
have
taken
place
;
so
that
I
may
not
be
really
a
widow
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
catching
at
the
straw
of
escape
that
the
fact
afforded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
absolutely
proved
,
perhaps
,
but
it
was
proved
circumstantially
.
*NL*
A
man
saw
him
drowning
,
too
.
No
reasonable
person
has
any
doubt
of
*NL*
his
death
;
nor
have
you
,
ma'am
,
I
should
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
none
now
,
or
I
should
have
acted
differently
,
''
she
said
,
*NL*
gently
.
``
I
certainly
,
at
first
,
had
a
strange
unaccountable
feeling
*NL*
that
he
could
not
have
perished
,
but
I
have
been
able
to
explain
that
*NL*
in
several
ways
since
.
But
though
I
am
fully
persuaded
that
I
shall
*NL*
see
him
no
more
,
I
am
far
from
thinking
of
marriage
with
another
.
I
*NL*
should
be
very
contemptible
to
indulge
in
such
a
thought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
silent
now
awhile
,
and
having
struck
into
an
unfrequented
*NL*
track
across
a
common
,
the
creaks
of
Boldwood
's
saddle
and
her
gig
*NL*
springs
were
all
the
sounds
to
be
heard
.
Boldwood
ended
the
pause
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
remember
when
I
carried
you
fainting
in
my
arms
into
the
*NL*
King
's
Arms
,
in
Casterbridge
?
Every
dog
has
his
day
:
that
was
mine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
--
I
know
it
all
,
''
she
said
,
hurriedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
for
one
,
shall
never
cease
regretting
that
events
so
fell
out
as
*NL*
to
deny
you
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
,
too
,
am
very
sorry
,
''
she
said
,
and
then
checked
herself
.
``
I
*NL*
mean
,
you
know
,
I
am
sorry
you
thought
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
always
this
dreary
pleasure
in
thinking
over
those
past
times
*NL*
with
you
--
that
I
was
something
to
you
before
HE
was
anything
,
and
*NL*
that
you
belonged
ALMOST
to
me
.
But
,
of
course
,
that
's
nothing
.
You
*NL*
never
liked
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
;
and
respected
you
,
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Which

*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
mean
which
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like

you
respect
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
--
at
least
,
I
can
not
tell
you

It
is
difficult
for
a
*NL*
woman
to
define
her
feelings
in
language
which
is
chiefly
made
by
men
*NL*
to
express
theirs
.
My
treatment
of
you
was
thoughtless
,
inexcusable
,
*NL*
wicked
!
I
shall
eternally
regret
it
.
If
there
had
been
anything
*NL*
I
could
have
done
to
make
amends
I
would
most
gladly
have
done
*NL*
it
--
there
was
nothing
on
earth
I
so
longed
to
do
as
to
repair
the
*NL*
error
.
But
that
was
not
possible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
blame
yourself

you
were
not
so
far
in
the
wrong
as
you

suppose

real
complete
proof
that
you

in
fact

you
are

would
you
repair
the
old
wrong

me

by
marrying
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not

I
should

yet

at
any
rate

at

*NL*
``
Oh
yes

at
some
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then

do
you
know
that

further
proof

any
kind
you

may
marry
again

about
six
years

*NL*
*NL*
``

she
said

quickly
.

I
know
all
that

talk

it

seven
or
six

may
we
all
be
by
that
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
will
soon
glide
by
,
and
it
will
seem
an
astonishingly
short
*NL*
time
to
look
back
upon
when
they
are
past

much
less
than
to
look
*NL*
forward
to
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

yes
;
I
have
found
that
in
my
own
experience
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
listen
once
more
,
''
Boldwood
pleaded
.
``
If
I
wait
that
time
,
will
*NL*
you
marry
me
?
You
own
that
you
owe
me
amends

let
that
be
your
way
*NL*
of
making
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Mr.
Boldwood
--
six
years
--

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
be
the

any

*NL*
``
No
indeed

mean

that
I
do

talk
about
this
matter
now

*NL*
Perhaps
it
is
not
proper
,
and
I
ought
not
to
allow
it
.
Let
us
drop
*NL*
it
.
My
husband
may
be
living
,
as
I
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
,
I
'll
drop
the
subject
if
you
wish

But
propriety
has
*NL*
nothing
to
do

reasons
.
I
am
a
middle-aged
man
,
willing
to
*NL*
protect
you
for
the
remainder
of
our
lives
.
On
your
side
,
at
least
,
*NL*
there
is
no
passion

blamable
haste

on
mine
,
perhaps
,
there
is

*NL*
But
I
ca
n't
help
seeing
that
if
you
choose
from
a
feeling
of
pity
,
*NL*
and
,
as
you
say
,
a
wish
to
make
amends
,
to
make
a
bargain
with
me
for
*NL*
a
far-ahead
time
--
an
agreement
which
will
set
all
things
right

*NL*
make
me
happy

late
though
it
may
be

there
is
no
fault

Had
n't
I
the
first
place
beside
you

you
been
almost
mine

Surely
you
can
say
to
me
as
much
*NL*
as
this
,
you
will
have
me
back
again
should
circumstances
permit
?
*NL*
Now
,
pray
speak
!
O
Bathsheba
,
promise
--
it
is
only
a
little
*NL*
promise
--
that
if
you
marry
again
,
you
will
marry
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
tone
was
so
excited
that
she
almost
feared
him
at
this
moment
,
*NL*
even
whilst
she
sympathized
.
It
was
a
simple
physical
fear
--
the
weak
*NL*
of
the
strong
;
there
was
no
emotional
aversion
or
inner
repugnance
.
*NL*
She
said
,
with
some
distress
in
her
voice
,
for
she
remembered
vividly
*NL*
his
outburst
on
the
Yalbury
Road
,
and
shrank
from
a
repetition
of
his
*NL*
anger
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
never
marry
another
man
whilst
you
wish
me
to
be
your
wife
,
*NL*
whatever
comes
--
but
to
say
more
--
you
have
taken
me
so
by
surprise
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
let
it
stand
in
these
simple
words
--
that
in
six
years
'
time
you
*NL*
will
be
my
wife
?
Unexpected
accidents
we
'll
not
mention
,
because
*NL*
those
,
of
course
,
must
be
given
way
to
.
Now
,
this
time
I
know
you
*NL*
will
keep
your
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
why
I
hesitate
to
give
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
do
give
it
!
Remember
the
past
,
and
be
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
breathed
;
and
then
said
mournfully
:
``
Oh
what
shall
I
do
?
I
do
n't
*NL*
love
you

I
much
fear

shall
love
you

much
as
a

If

know
that

I
can
*NL*
yet
give
you
happiness
by
a
mere
promise
to
marry
at
the
end
of
six
*NL*
years
,
if
my
husband
should
not
come
back
,
it
is
a
great
honour
to
*NL*
me

And
if
you
value
such
an
act
of
friendship
from
a
woman
who
*NL*
does
n't
esteem
herself
as
she
did
,
and
has
little
love
left
,
why
*NL*
I
--
I
will
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Promise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
--
Consider
,
if
I
can
not
promise
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
soon
is
perhaps
never

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
it
is
not
!
I
mean
soon
.
Christmas
,
we
'll
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Christmas
!
''
He
said
nothing
further
till
he
added
:
``
Well
,
I
'll
say
*NL*
no
more
to
you
about
it
till
that
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
in
a
very
peculiar
state
of
mind
,
which
showed
how
*NL*
entirely
the
soul
is
the
slave
of
the
body
,
the
ethereal
spirit
*NL*
dependent
for
its
quality
upon
the
tangible
flesh
and
blood
.
It
is
*NL*
hardly
too
much
to
say
that
she
felt
coerced
by
a
force
stronger
than
*NL*
her
own
will
,
not
only
into
the
act
of
promising
upon
this
singularly
*NL*
remote
and
vague
matter
,
but
into
the
emotion
of
fancying
that
she
*NL*
ought
to
promise
.
When
the
weeks
intervening
between
the
night
of
*NL*
this
conversation
and
Christmas
day
began
perceptibly
to
diminish
,
*NL*
her
anxiety
and
perplexity
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
she
was
led
by
an
accident
into
an
oddly
confidential
*NL*
dialogue
with
Gabriel
about
her
difficulty
.
It
afforded
her
a
little
*NL*
relief
--
of
a
dull
and
cheerless
kind
.
They
were
auditing
accounts
,
*NL*
and
something
occurred
in
the
course
of
their
labours
which
led
Oak
*NL*
to
say
,
speaking
of
Boldwood
,
``
He
'll
never
forget
you
,
ma'am
,
never
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
out
came
her
trouble
before
she
was
aware
;
and
she
told
him
how
*NL*
she
had
again
got
into
the
toils
;
what
Boldwood
had
asked
her
,
and
*NL*
how
he
was
expecting
her
assent
.
``
The
most
mournful
reason
of
all
*NL*
for
my
agreeing
to
it
,
''
she
said
sadly
,
``
and
the
true
reason
why
I
*NL*
think
to
do
so
for
good
or
for
evil
,
is
this
--
it
is
a
thing
I
have
*NL*
not
breathed
to
a
living
soul
as
yet
--
I
believe
that
if
I
do
n't
give
*NL*
my
word
,
he
'll
go
out
of
his
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Really
,
do
ye
?
''
said
Gabriel
,
gravely
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
this
,
''
she
continued
,
with
reckless
frankness
;
``
and
Heaven
*NL*
knows
I
say
it
in
a
spirit
the
very
reverse
of
vain
,
for
I
am
grieved
*NL*
and
troubled
to
my
soul
about
it
--
I
believe
I
hold
that
man
's
future
*NL*
in
my
hand
.
His
career
depends
entirely
upon
my
treatment
of
him
.
O
*NL*
Gabriel
,
I
tremble
at
my
responsibility
,
for
it
is
terrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
think
this
much
,
ma'am
,
as
I
told
you
years
ago
,
''
said
Oak
,
*NL*
``
that
his
life
is
a
total
blank
whenever
he
is
n't
hoping
for
`
ee
;
but
*NL*
I
ca
n't
suppose
--
I
hope
that
nothing
so
dreadful
hangs
on
to
it
as
*NL*
you
fancy
.
His
natural
manner
has
always
been
dark
and
strange
,
you
*NL*
know
.
But
since
the
case
is
so
sad
and
odd-like
,
why
do
n't
ye
give
*NL*
the
conditional
promise
?
I
think
I
would
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
right
?
Some
rash
acts
of
my
past
life
have
taught
me
that
*NL*
a
watched
woman
must
have
very
much
circumspection
to
retain
only
a
*NL*
very
little
credit
,
and
I
do
want
and
long
to
be
discreet
in
this
!
*NL*
And
six
years
--
why
we
may
all
be
in
our
graves
by
that
time
,
even
if
*NL*
Mr.
Troy
does
not
come
back
again
,
which
he
may
not
impossibly
do
!
*NL*
Such
thoughts
give
a
sort
of
absurdity
to
the
scheme
.
Now
,
is
n't
*NL*
it
preposterous
,
Gabriel
?
However
he
came
to
dream
of
it
,
I
can
not
*NL*
think
.
But
is
it
wrong
?
You
know
--
you
are
older
than
I.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eight
years
older
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
eight
years
--
and
is
it
wrong
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
it
would
be
an
uncommon
agreement
for
a
man
and
woman
to
*NL*
make
:
I
do
n't
see
anything
really
wrong
about
it
,
''
said
Oak
,
slowly
.
*NL*
``
In
fact
the
very
thing
that
makes
it
doubtful
if
you
ought
to
marry
*NL*
en
under
any
condition
,
that
is
,
your
not
caring
about
him
--
for
I
*NL*
may
suppose
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
you
may
suppose
that
love
is
wanting
,
''
she
said
shortly
.
``
Love
*NL*
is
an
utterly
bygone
,
sorry
,
worn-out
,
miserable
thing
with
me
--
for
*NL*
him
or
any
one
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
your
want
of
love
seems
to
me
the
one
thing
that
takes
away
*NL*
harm
from
such
an
agreement
with
him
.
If
wild
heat
had
to
do
wi

*NL*
it
,
making
ye
long
to
over-come
the
awkwardness
about
your
husband

*NL*
vanishing
,
it
mid
be
wrong
;
but
a
cold-hearted
agreement
to
oblige
a
*NL*
man
seems
different
,
somehow
.
The
real
sin
,
ma'am
in
my
mind
,
lies
*NL*
in
thinking
of
ever
wedding
wi
'
a
man
you
do
n't
love
honest
and
*NL*
true
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
I
'm
willing
to
pay
the
penalty
of
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
firmly
.
*NL*
``
You
know
,
Gabriel
,
this
is
what
I
can
not
get
off
my
conscience
--
that
*NL*
I
once
seriously
injured
him
in
sheer
idleness
.
If
I
had
never
*NL*
played
a
trick
upon
him
,
he
would
never
have
wanted
to
marry
me
.
Oh
*NL*
if
I
could
only
pay
some
heavy
damages
in
money
to
him
for
the
harm
*NL*
I
did
,
and
so
get
the
sin
off
my
soul
that
way
!
...
Well
,
there
's
*NL*
the
debt
,
which
can
only
be
discharged
in
one
way
,
and
I
believe
*NL*
I
am
bound
to
do
it
if
it
honestly
lies
in
my
power
,
without
any
*NL*
consideration
of
my
own
future
at
all
.
When
a
rake
gambles
away
his
*NL*
expectations
,
the
fact
that
it
is
an
inconvenient
debt
does
n't
make
*NL*
him
the
less
liable
.
I
've
been
a
rake
,
and
the
single
point
I
ask
*NL*
you
is
,
considering
that
my
own
scruples
,
and
the
fact
that
in
the
*NL*
eye
of
the
law
my
husband
is
only
missing
,
will
keep
any
man
from
*NL*
marrying
me
until
seven
years
have
passed
--
am
I
free
to
entertain
*NL*
such
an
idea
,
even
though
't
is
a
sort
of
penance
--
for
it
will
be
*NL*
that
?
I
HATE
the
act
of
marriage
under
such
circumstances
,
and
the
*NL*
class
of
women
I
should
seem
to
belong
to
by
doing
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
to
me
that
all
depends
upon
whe

you
think
,
as
everybody
*NL*
else
do
,
that
your
husband
is
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
've
long
ceased
to
doubt
that
.
I
well
know
what
would
have
*NL*
brought
him
back
long
before
this
time
if
he
had
lived
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
in
a
religious
sense
you
will
be
as
free
to
THINK
o

*NL*
marrying
again
as
any
real
widow
of
one
year
's
standing
.
But
why
*NL*
do
n't
ye
ask
Mr.
Thirdly
's
advice
on
how
to
treat
Mr.
Boldwood
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
When
I
want
a
broad-minded
opinion
for
general
enlightenment
,
*NL*
distinct
from
special
advice
,
I
never
go
to
a
man
who
deals
in
*NL*
the
subject
professionally
.
So
I
like
the
parson
's
opinion
on
*NL*
law
,
the
lawyer
's
on
doctoring
,
the
doctor
's
on
business
,
and
my
*NL*
business-man
's
--
that
is
,
yours
--
on
morals
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
on
love

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
there
's
a
hitch
in
that
argument
,
''
said
Oak
,
with
a
grave
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
reply
at
once
,
and
then
saying
,
``
Good
evening
,
Mr.
Oak
.
''
*NL*
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
spoken
frankly
,
and
neither
asked
nor
expected
any
reply
*NL*
from
Gabriel
more
satisfactory
than
that
she
had
obtained
.
Yet
in
*NL*
the
centremost
parts
of
her
complicated
heart
there
existed
at
this
*NL*
minute
a
little
pang
of
disappointment
,
for
a
reason
she
would
not
*NL*
allow
herself
to
recognize
.
Oak
had
not
once
wished
her
free
that
he
*NL*
might
marry
her
himself
--
had
not
once
said
,
``
I
could
wait
for
you
as
*NL*
well
as
he
.
''
That
was
the
insect
sting
.
Not
that
she
would
have
*NL*
listened
to
any
such
hypothesis
.
O
no
--
for
was
n't
she
saying
all
*NL*
the
time
that
such
thoughts
of
the
future
were
improper
,
and
was
n't
*NL*
Gabriel
far
too
poor
a
man
to
speak
sentiment
to
her
?
Yet
he
might
*NL*
have
just
hinted
about
that
old
love
of
his
,
and
asked
,
in
a
playful
*NL*
off-hand
way
,
if
he
might
speak
of
it
.
It
would
have
seemed
pretty
*NL*
and
sweet
,
if
no
more
;
and
then
she
would
have
shown
how
kind
and
*NL*
inoffensive
a
woman
's
``
No
''
can
sometimes
be
.
But
to
give
such
cool
*NL*
advice
--
the
very
advice
she
had
asked
for
--
it
ruffled
our
heroine
all
*NL*
the
afternoon

CONVERGING
COURSES
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Christmas-eve
came
,
and
a
party
that
Boldwood
was
to
give
in
the
*NL*
evening
was
the
great
subject
of
talk
in
Weatherbury
.
It
was
not
*NL*
that
the
rarity
of
Christmas
parties
in
the
parish
made
this
one
a
*NL*
wonder
,
but
that
Boldwood
should
be
the
giver
.
The
announcement
*NL*
had
had
an
abnormal
and
incongruous
sound
,
as
if
one
should
hear
of
*NL*
croquet-playing
in
a
cathedral
aisle
,
or
that
some
much-respected
*NL*
judge
was
going
upon
the
stage
.
That
the
party
was
intended
to
be
*NL*
a
truly
jovial
one
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
.
A
large
bough
of
*NL*
mistletoe
had
been
brought
from
the
woods
that
day
,
and
suspended
*NL*
in
the
hall
of
the
bachelor
's
home
.
Holly
and
ivy
had
followed
in
*NL*
armfuls
.
From
six
that
morning
till
past
noon
the
huge
wood
fire
*NL*
in
the
kitchen
roared
and
sparkled
at
its
highest
,
the
kettle
,
the
*NL*
saucepan
,
and
the
three-legged
pot
appearing
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
flames
like
Shadrach
,
Meshach
,
and
Abednego
;
moreover
,
roasting
*NL*
and
basting
operations
were
continually
carried
on
in
front
of
the
*NL*
genial
blaze
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
it
grew
later
the
fire
was
made
up
in
the
large
long
hall
into
*NL*
which
the
staircase
descended
,
and
all
encumbrances
were
cleared
out
*NL*
for
dancing
.
The
log
which
was
to
form
the
back-brand
of
the
evening
*NL*
fire
was
the
uncleft
trunk
of
a
tree
,
so
unwieldy
that
it
could
be
*NL*
neither
brought
nor
rolled
to
its
place
;
and
accordingly
two
men
were
*NL*
to
be
observed
dragging
and
heaving
it
in
by
chains
and
levers
as
the
*NL*
hour
of
assembly
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
all
this
,
the
spirit
of
revelry
was
wanting
in
the
*NL*
atmosphere
of
the
house
.
Such
a
thing
had
never
been
attempted
*NL*
before
by
its
owner
,
and
it
was
now
done
as
by
a
wrench
.
Intended
*NL*
gaieties
would
insist
upon
appearing
like
solemn
grandeurs
,
the
*NL*
organization
of
the
whole
effort
was
carried
out
coldly
,
by
*NL*
hirelings
,
and
a
shadow
seemed
to
move
about
the
rooms
,
saying
that
*NL*
the
proceedings
were
unnatural
to
the
place
and
the
lone
man
who
*NL*
lived
therein
,
and
hence
not
good
.

*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
was
at
this
time
in
her
room
,
dressing
for
the
event
.
She
*NL*
had
called
for
candles
,
and
Liddy
entered
and
placed
one
on
each
side
*NL*
of
her
mistress
's
glass
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
go
away
,
Liddy
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
almost
timidly
.
``
I
am
*NL*
foolishly
agitated
--
I
can
not
tell
why
.
I
wish
I
had
not
been
obliged
*NL*
to
go
to
this
dance
;
but
there
's
no
escaping
now
.
I
have
not
spoken
*NL*
to
Mr.
Boldwood
since
the
autumn
,
when
I
promised
to
see
him
at
*NL*
Christmas
on
business
,
but
I
had
no
idea
there
was
to
be
anything
of
*NL*
this
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
would
go
now
,
''
said
Liddy
,
who
was
going
with
her
;
for
*NL*
Boldwood
had
been
indiscriminate
in
his
invitations
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
shall
make
my
appearance
,
of
course
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
``
But
I
*NL*
am
THE
CAUSE
of
the
party
,
and
that
upsets
me
!
--
Do
n't
tell
,
Liddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
ma'am
.
You
the
cause
of
it
,
ma'am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
I
am
the
reason
of
the
party
--
I
.
If
it
had
not
been
for
me
,
*NL*
there
would
never
have
been
one
.
I
ca
n't
explain
any
more
--
there
's
*NL*
no
more
to
be
explained
.
I
wish
I
had
never
seen
Weatherbury
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
wicked
of
you
--
to
wish
to
be
worse
off
than
you
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Liddy
.
I
have
never
been
free
from
trouble
since
I
have
lived
*NL*
here
,
and
this
party
is
likely
to
bring
me
more
.
Now
,
fetch
my
black
*NL*
silk
dress
,
and
see
how
it
sits
upon
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
will
leave
off
that
,
surely
,
ma'am
?
You
have
been
a
*NL*
widow-lady
fourteen
months
,
and
ought
to
brighten
up
a
little
on
*NL*
such
a
night
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
it
necessary
?
No
;
I
will
appear
as
usual
,
for
if
I
were
to
wear
*NL*
any
light
dress
people
would
say
things
about
me
,
and
I
should
seem
*NL*
to
be
rejoicing
when
I
am
solemn
all
the
time
.
The
party
does
n't
*NL*
suit
me
a
bit
;
but
never
mind
,
stay
and
help
to
finish
me
off

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
was
dressing
also
at
this
hour
.
A
tailor
from
Casterbridge
*NL*
was
with
him
,
assisting
him
in
the
operation
of
trying
on
a
new
coat
*NL*
that
had
just
been
brought
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
Boldwood
been
so
fastidious
,
unreasonable
about
the
fit
,
*NL*
and
generally
difficult
to
please
.
The
tailor
walked
round
and
round
*NL*
him
,
tugged
at
the
waist
,
pulled
the
sleeve
,
pressed
out
the
collar
,
*NL*
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
experience
Boldwood
was
not
bored
.
*NL*
Times
had
been
when
the
farmer
had
exclaimed
against
all
such
*NL*
niceties
as
childish
,
but
now
no
philosophic
or
hasty
rebuke
whatever
*NL*
was
provoked
by
this
man
for
attaching
as
much
importance
to
a
crease
*NL*
in
the
coat
as
to
an
earthquake
in
South
America
.
Boldwood
at
last
*NL*
expressed
himself
nearly
satisfied
,
and
paid
the
bill
,
the
tailor
*NL*
passing
out
of
the
door
just
as
Oak
came
in
to
report
progress
for
*NL*
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Oak
,
''
said
Boldwood
.
``
I
shall
of
course
see
you
here
to-night
.
*NL*
Make
yourself
merry
.
I
am
determined
that
neither
expense
nor
*NL*
trouble
shall
be
spared
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
try
to
be
here
,
sir
,
though
perhaps
it
may
not
be
very
early
,
''
*NL*
said
Gabriel
,
quietly
.
``
I
am
glad
indeed
to
see
such
a
change
in
*NL*
`
ee
from
what
it
used
to
be
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
I
must
own
it
--
I
am
bright
to-night
:
cheerful
and
more
than
*NL*
cheerful
--
so
much
so
that
I
am
almost
sad
again
with
the
sense
that
*NL*
all
of
it
is
passing
away
.
And
sometimes
,
when
I
am
excessively
*NL*
hopeful
and
blithe
,
a
trouble
is
looming
in
the
distance
:
so
that
I
*NL*
often
get
to
look
upon
gloom
in
me
with
content
,
and
to
fear
a
happy
*NL*
mood
.
Still
this
may
be
absurd
--
I
feel
that
it
is
absurd
.
Perhaps
*NL*
my
day
is
dawning
at
last
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
it
`
ill
be
a
long
and
a
fair
one
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
--
thank
you
.
Yet
perhaps
my
cheerfulness
rests
on
a
*NL*
slender
hope
.
And
yet
I
trust
my
hope
.
It
is
faith
,
not
hope
.
I
*NL*
think
this
time
I
reckon
with
my
host
.
--
Oak
,
my
hands
are
a
little
*NL*
shaky
,
or
something
;
I
ca
n't
tie
this
neckerchief
properly
.
Perhaps
*NL*
you
will
tie
it
for
me
.
The
fact
is
,
I
have
not
been
well
lately
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
to
hear
that
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
nothing
.
I
want
it
done
as
well
as
you
can

Is
*NL*
there
any
late
knot
in
fashion
,
Oak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
''
said
Oak
.
His
tone
had
sunk
to
sadness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
approached
Gabriel
,
and
as
Oak
tied
the
neckerchief
the
*NL*
farmer
went
on
feverishly
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
a
woman
keep
her
promise
,
Gabriel
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
is
not

*NL*

Oak

You
have
got
quite
cynical
lately

how
*NL*
is
it
?
We
seem
to
have
shifted
our
positions
:
I
have
become
the
*NL*
young
and
hopeful
man
,
and
you
the
old
and
unbelieving
one
.
However
,
*NL*
does
a
woman
keep
a
promise
,
not
to
marry
,
but
to
enter
on
an
*NL*
engagement
to
marry
at
some
time
?
Now
you
know
women
better
than
*NL*
I

tell
me

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afeard
you

she

*NL*
keep
such
a

if
it
is
made
with
an
honest
meaning
to
repair
*NL*
a
wrong

*NL*
*NL*
``
It

not
gone
far

I

he
said

in

impulsive
whisper

``
I
have
pressed
her
upon
*NL*
the

she
inclines
to
be
kind
to
me

to
think
of
me
*NL*
as
a
husband
at
a
long
future
time
,
and
that
's
enough
for
me
.
How
*NL*
can
I
expect
more
?
She
has
a
notion
that
a
woman
should
not
marry
*NL*
within
seven
years
of
her
husband
's
disappearance
--
that
her
own
self
*NL*
should
n't
,
I
mean
--
because
his
body
was
not
found

It
may
be
merely
*NL*
this
legal
reason
which
influences
her
,
or
it
may
be
a
religious
*NL*
one
,
but
she
is
reluctant
to
talk
on
the
point

Yet
she
has

implied

she
will
ratify
an
engagement
to-night

he
said

with
impatience

Five

*NL*
nine
months
,
and
a
few
days

Fifteen
months
nearly
have
passed
since
*NL*
he
vanished
,
and
is
there
anything
so
wonderful
in
an
engagement
of
*NL*
little
more
than
five
years
?

*NL*
*NL*

It
seems
long
in

Do

Remember

you

there

she

Never

vehemently

smoking

A

entered
.

*NL*
``
Well

had
laughed

it
was
with

some
anxiety
that
he
said

Upon

I
should
never

*NL*
``
I

n't
been

There
's
a
deal
of
feeling
on
his
side
*NL*
seemingly
,
but
I
do
n't
answer
for
her
.
I
did
n't
know
a
word
about
*NL*
any
such
thing
till
yesterday
,
and
all
I
heard
then
was
that
she
was
*NL*
gwine
to
the
party
at
his
house
to-night

This
is
the
first

spoke
to

were
at

Fair

However

'm
not

Own
that
you
never
saw
a
finer

more
splendid
creature
*NL*
in

life

Upon
my
honour
,
when
I
set
eyes
upon

that
day
I
*NL*
wondered
what
I
could
have
been
made
of
to
be
able
to
leave
her
by

herself
so
long

And
then
I
was
hampered

I
'm
free
of
at

He
smoked
on
awhile

*NL*

then
added
,
``
How
did
she
look
when
you
passed
by
yesterday

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
she
took
no

heed

ye
may
well

she
looked
*NL*
well
enough

far
's
I
know

Just
flashed
her
haughty
eyes
upon
my
*NL*
poor
scram
body
,
and
then
let
them
go
past
me
to
what
was
yond
,
much
*NL*
as
if
I
'd
been
no
more
than
a
leafless
tree

She
had
just
got
off
*NL*
her
mare
to
look
at
the
last
wring-down
of
cider
for
the
year
;
she
*NL*
had
been
riding
,
and
so
her
colours
were
up
and
her
breath
rather
*NL*
quick
,
so
that
her
bosom
plimmed
and
fell
--
plimmed
and
fell
--
every
*NL*
time
plain
to
my
eye

Ay
,
and
there
were
the
fellers
round
her
*NL*
wringing
down
the
cheese

bustling
about

saying

Ware

pommy

`
Never

she

Then
Gabe
brought
her
some
of

she
must

it
through

not

before

want
to
mention
what

passing
in
my
mind
lately

that
little
arrangement
we
made
about
*NL*
your
share
in
the
farm
I
mean
.
That
share
is
small
,
too
small
,
*NL*
considering
how
little
I
attend
to
business
now
,
and
how
much
time
*NL*
and
thought
you
give

it

Well

for

I
want
to
show
my
sense
of
it
by
increasing
your
proportion

in

partnership

I
'll
make
a
memorandum
of
the
arrangement
which
*NL*
struck
me
as
likely
to
be
convenient
,
for
I
have
n't
time
to
talk
*NL*
about
it
now

and
then
we
'll
discuss
it
at

ultimately
to
retire
from

altogether

until
you

can
take
all
the
expenditure
upon
your
shoulders

I
'll
be
a
sleeping

partner

the
stock

the

on

Oak

I
have
learnt
a
little
*NL*
about
your
secret
:
your
interest

is
more
than
that
of
bailiff

for

employer

you
have
behaved
like
a
man

I

as
a
sort
*NL*
of
successful
rival
--
successful
partly
through
your
goodness
of
*NL*
heart

should
like
definitely
to
show
my
sense
of
your
friendship

what
must
have
been
a
great
pain
to

not

used

so
shall
I.

*NL*
Oak
then
left
him

He
was
uneasy
on
Boldwood
's
account
,
for
he
saw
*NL*
anew
that
this
constant
passion
of
the
farmer
made
him
not
the
man
*NL*
he
once
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Boldwood
continued
awhile
in
his
room
alone
--
ready
and
dressed
to
*NL*
receive
his
company
--
the
mood
of
anxiety
about
his
appearance
seemed
*NL*
to
pass
away
,
and
to
be
succeeded
by
a
deep
solemnity
.
He
looked
out
*NL*
of
the
window
,
and
regarded
the
dim
outline
of
the
trees
upon
the
*NL*
sky
,
and
the
twilight
deepening
to
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
went
to
a
locked
closet
,
and
took
from
a
locked
drawer
*NL*
therein
a
small
circular
case
the
size
of
a
pillbox
,
and
was
about
to
*NL*
put
it
into
his
pocket
.
But
he
lingered
to
open
the
cover
and
take
*NL*
a
momentary
glance
inside
.
It
contained
a
woman
's
finger-ring
,
set
*NL*
all
the
way
round
with
small
diamonds
,
and
from
its
appearance
had
*NL*
evidently
been
recently
purchased
.
Boldwood
's
eyes
dwelt
upon
its
*NL*
many
sparkles
a
long
time
,
though
that
its
material
aspect
concerned
*NL*
him
little
was
plain
from
his
manner
and
mien
,
which
were
those
of
*NL*
a
mind
following
out
the
presumed
thread
of
that
jewel
's
future
*NL*
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
noise
of
wheels
at
the
front
of
the
house
became
audible
.
*NL*
Boldwood
closed
the
box
,
stowed
it
away
carefully
in
his
pocket
,
and
*NL*
went
out
upon
the
landing
.
The
old
man
who
was
his
indoor
factotum
*NL*
came
at
the
same
moment
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
be
coming
,
sir
--
lots
of
'em
--
a-foot
and
a-driving
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
coming
down
this
moment
.
Those
wheels
I
heard
--
is
it
Mrs.
*NL*
Troy
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
--
't
is
not
she
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
reserved
and
sombre
expression
had
returned
to
Boldwood
's
face
*NL*
again
,
but
it
poorly
cloaked
his
feelings
when
he
pronounced
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
name
;
and
his
feverish
anxiety
continued
to
show
its
*NL*
existence
by
a
galloping
motion
of
his
fingers
upon
the
side
of
*NL*
his
thigh
as
he
went
down
the
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
does
this
cover
me
?
''
said
Troy
to
Pennyways
.
``
Nobody
would
*NL*
recognize
me
now
,
I
'm
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
buttoning
on
a
heavy
grey
overcoat
of
Noachian
cut
,
with
cape
*NL*
and
high
collar
,
the
latter
being
erect
and
rigid
,
like
a
girdling
*NL*
wall
,
and
nearly
reaching
to
the
verge
of
a
travelling
cap
which
was
*NL*
pulled
down
over
his
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pennyways
snuffed
the
candle
,
and
then
looked
up
and
deliberately
*NL*
inspected
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
made
up
your
mind
to
go
then
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Made
up
my
mind
?
Yes
;
of
course
I
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
not
write
to
her
?
'T
is
a
very
queer
corner
that
you
have
got
*NL*
into
,
sergeant
.
You
see
all
these
things
will
come
to
light
if
you
*NL*
go
back
,
and
they
wo
n't
sound
well
at
all
.
Faith
,
if
I
was
you
I
'd
*NL*
even
bide
as
you
be
--
a
single
man
of
the
name
of
Francis
.
A
good
*NL*
wife
is
good
,
but
the
best
wife
is
not
so
good
as
no
wife
at
all
.
*NL*
Now
that
's
my
outspoke
mind
,
and
I
've
been
called
a
long-headed
*NL*
feller
here
and
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
nonsense
!
''
said
Troy
,
angrily
.
``
There
she
is
with
plenty
of
*NL*
money
,
and
a
house
and
farm
,
and
horses
,
and
comfort
,
and
here
am
I
*NL*
living
from
hand
to
mouth
--
a
needy
adventurer
.
Besides
,
it
is
no
use
*NL*
talking
now
;
it
is
too
late
,
and
I
am
glad
of
it
;
I
've
been
seen
and
*NL*
recognized
here
this
very
afternoon
.
I
should
have
gone
back
to
her
*NL*
the
day
after
the
fair
,
if
it
had
n't
been
for
you
talking
about
the

law

rubbish
about
getting
a
separation

I
do
n't
put
it
off
*NL*
any

What
the
deuce
put
it
into
my
head
to
run
away
at
all

I
*NL*
ca
n't

Humbugging
sentiment

what
it
was

But
what
man
*NL*
on
earth
was
to
know
that
his

would
be
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
*NL*
rid
of
his
name
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
known

She
's
bad
enough
for
anything

*NL*
*NL*
``

who
you
are
talking

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

all
I
say

this

go
abroad

again
where
I
came
from

't
is

late
to
do
it
now

I
would
n't

stir
up
the
business
and
get
a
bad

for
the
sake
of
living
with
*NL*
her

all
that
about
your
play-acting
is
sure
to
come
out
,

*NL*
know

you
think
otherwise

My
eyes

there
'll
*NL*
be
a
racket
if

go
back
just
now

in

of

Christmasing

*NL*
*NL*
``
H

yes

I
expect
I
shall
not
be
a
very
welcome
guest
if
he
has
*NL*
her
there

said
the
sergeant
,
with
a
slight
laugh
.
``
A
sort
of
*NL*
Alonzo
the
Brave
;
and
when
I
go
in
the
guests
will
sit
in
silence

*NL*
fear
,

all
laughter

pleasure
will
be
hushed

the
lights
in

the
chamber
burn
blue
,
and
the
worms
--
Ugh

horrible
!
--
Ring
for
some
*NL*
more
brandy

Pennyways
,
I
felt
an
awful
shudder
just
then
!
Well
,
*NL*
what
is
there
besides
?
A
stick
--
I
must
have
a
walking-stick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pennyways
now
felt
himself
to
be
in
something
of
a
difficulty
,
for
*NL*
should
Bathsheba
and
Troy
become
reconciled
it
would
be
necessary
*NL*
to
regain
her
good
opinion
if
he
would
secure
the
patronage
of
her
*NL*
husband
.
``
I
sometimes
think
she
likes
you
yet
,
and
is
a
good
woman
*NL*
at
bottom
,

he
said
,
as
a
saving
sentence
.
``
But
there
's
no
telling
*NL*

a
certainty
from

outside

Well

you
'll
do
as
you
like
*NL*
about
going

as
for

I
'll
do
as
you
tell

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
let
me
see
what
the
time
is
,
''
said
Troy
,
after
emptying
his
*NL*
glass
in
one
draught
as
he
stood
.
``
Half-past
six
o'clock

I

not

there

CHAPTER

*NL*
CONCURRITUR
--
HORAE
MOMENTO
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Outside
the
front
of
Boldwood
's
house
a
group
of
men
stood
in
the
*NL*
dark
,
with
their
faces
towards
the
door
,
which
occasionally
opened
*NL*
and
closed
for
the
passage
of
some
guest
or
servant
,
when
a
golden
*NL*
rod
of
light
would
stripe
the
ground
for
the
moment
and
vanish
again
,
*NL*
leaving
nothing
outside
but
the
glowworm
shine
of
the
pale
lamp
amid
*NL*
the
evergreens
over
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
was
seen
in
Casterbridge
this
afternoon
--
so
the
boy
said
,
''
one
of
*NL*
them
remarked
in
a
whisper
.
``
And
I
for
one
believe
it
.
His
body
was
*NL*
never
found
,
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
a
strange
story
,
''
said
the
next
.
``
You
may
depend
upo
n't
that
*NL*
she
knows
nothing
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
word
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
do
n't
mean
that
she
shall
,
''
said
another
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
he
's
alive
and
here
in
the
neighbourhood
,
he
means
mischief
,
''
*NL*
said
the
first
.
``
Poor
young
thing
:
I
do
pity
her
,
if
't
is
true
.
*NL*
He
'll
drag
her
to
the
dogs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
O
no
;
he
'll
settle
down
quiet
enough
,
''
said
one
disposed
to
take
a
*NL*
more
hopeful
view
of
the
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
fool
she
must
have
been
ever
to
have
had
anything
to
do
with
*NL*
the
man
!
She
is
so
self-willed
and
independent
too
,
that
one
is
more
*NL*
minded
to
say
it
serves
her
right
than
pity
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
.
I
do
n't
hold
with
`
ee
there
.
She
was
no
otherwise
than
a
*NL*
girl
mind
,
and
how
could
she
tell
what
the
man
was
made
of
?
If
't
is
*NL*
really
true
,
't
is
too
hard
a
punishment
,
and
more
than
she
ought
to
*NL*
hae
.
--
Hullo
,
who
's
that
?
''
This
was
to
some
footsteps
that
were
heard
*NL*
approaching
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
William
Smallbury
,
''
said
a
dim
figure
in
the
shades
,
coming
up
and
*NL*
joining
them
.
``
Dark
as
a
hedge
,
to-night
,
is
n't
it
?
I
all
but
missed
*NL*
the
plank
over
the
river
ath
`
art
there
in
the
bottom
--
never
did
such
*NL*
a
thing
before
in
my
life
.
Be
ye
any
of
Boldwood
's
workfolk
?

He
*NL*
peered
into
their
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

all
o
'
us
.
We
met
here
a
few
minutes
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

now

Samway

Going

*NL*
*NL*
``
Presently

But
I
say

William

Samway
whispered
,
``
have

*NL*
*NL*
``
What

that
about
Sergeant
Troy
being
seen

said
*NL*
Smallbury
,
also
lowering
his
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
:
in
Casterbridge
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

I
have

Laban
Tall
named
a

to

now

do
n't

it

Hark
,
here

comes
himself

a
b

A
*NL*
footstep
drew
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Laban
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
't
is
I

said
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
ye
heard
any
more
about
that

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

said
Tall
,
joining
the
group
.
``
And
I
'm
inclined
to
think
we

better
keep
quiet

If

and
some

she

never

been
anything

She
's
hot

hasty

but
she
's
a
brave

girl
who
'll
never
tell
a
lie
however
much
the
truth
may
harm
her

I

*NL*
*NL*
``

never

's

can
be

of

''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
silent
then
,
every
man
busied
with
his
own
thoughts
,
*NL*
during
which
interval
sounds
of
merriment
could
be
heard
within
.
*NL*
Then
the
front
door
again
opened
,
the
rays
streamed
out
,
the
*NL*
well-known
form
of
Boldwood
was
seen
in
the
rectangular
area
of
*NL*
light
,
the
door
closed
,
and
Boldwood
walked
slowly
down
the
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
''
'T
is
master
,
''
one
of
the
men
whispered
,
as
he
neared
them
.
``
We
'd
*NL*
better
stand
quiet
--
he
'll
go
in
again
directly
.
He
would
think
it
*NL*
unseemly
o
'
us
to
be
loitering
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
came
on
,
and
passed
by
the
men
without
seeing
them
,
they
*NL*
being
under
the
bushes
on
the
grass
.
He
paused
,
leant
over
the
gate
,
*NL*
and
breathed
a
long
breath
.
They
heard
low
words
come
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
to
God
she
'll
come
,
or
this
night
will
be
nothing
but
misery
*NL*
to
me
!
Oh
my
darling
,
my
darling
,
why
do
you
keep
me
in
suspense
*NL*
like
this
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
said
this
to
himself
,
and
they
all
distinctly
heard
it
.
Boldwood
*NL*
remained
silent
after
that
,
and
the
noise
from
indoors
was
again
*NL*
just
audible
,
until
,
a
few
minutes
later
,
light
wheels
could
be
*NL*
distinguished
coming
down
the
hill
.
They
drew
nearer
,
and
ceased
at
*NL*
the
gate
.
Boldwood
hastened
back
to
the
door
,
and
opened
it
;
and
the
*NL*
light
shone
upon
Bathsheba
coming
up
the
path
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
compressed
his
emotion
to
mere
welcome
:
the
men
marked
her
*NL*
light
laugh
and
apology
as
she
met
him
:
he
took
her
into
the
house
;
*NL*
and
the
door
closed
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gracious
heaven
,
I
did
n't
know
it
was
like
that
with
him

''
said
one
*NL*
of
the
men
.
``
I
thought
that
fancy
of
his
was
over
long
ago

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
know
much

Samway

*NL*
``
I
would
n't

should
know

heard

said

*NL*
remarked
a
third
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
had
told
of
the
report
at
once
,
''
the
first
uneasily
*NL*
continued
.
``
More
harm
may
come
of
this

Poor

Well

for
a
few
*NL*
minutes
first
,
shall
us
,
neighbours
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Samway
,
Tall
,
and
Smallbury
agreed
to
go
to
Warren
's
,
and
went
out
at
*NL*
the
gate
,
the
remaining
ones
entering
the
house
.
The
three
soon
drew
*NL*
near
the
malt-house
,
approaching
it
from
the
adjoining
orchard
,
and
*NL*
not
by
way
of
the
street
.
The
pane
of
glass
was
illuminated
as
*NL*
usual
.
Smallbury
was
a
little
in
advance
of
the
rest
when
,
pausing
,
*NL*
he
turned
suddenly
to
his
companions
and
said
,
``
Hist
!
See
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
light
from
the
pane
was
now
perceived
to
be
shining
not
upon
the
*NL*
ivied
wall
as
usual
,
but
upon
some
object
close
to
the
glass
.
It
was
*NL*
a
human
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
come
closer
,
''
whispered
Samway
;
and
they
approached
on
tiptoe
.
*NL*
There
was
no
disbelieving
the
report
any
longer
.
Troy
's
face
was
*NL*
almost
close
to
the
pane
,
and
he
was
looking
in
.
Not
only
was
he
*NL*
looking
in
,
but
he
appeared
to
have
been
arrested
by
a
conversation
*NL*
which
was
in
progress
in
the
malt-house
,
the
voices
of
the
*NL*
interlocutors
being
those
of
Oak
and
the
maltster
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
spree
is
all
in
her
honour
,
is
n't
it
--
hey
?
''
said
the
old
man
.
*NL*
``
Although
he
made
believe
't
is
only
keeping
up
o
'
Christmas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
say
,
''
replied
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
't
is
true
enough
,
faith
.
I
can
not
understand
Farmer
Boldwood
*NL*
being
such
a
fool
at
his
time
of
life
as
to
ho
and
hanker
after
this
*NL*
woman
in
the
way
'
a
do
,
and
she
not
care
a
bit
about
en
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
,
after
recognizing
Troy
's
features
,
withdrew
across
*NL*
the
orchard
as
quietly
as
they
had
come
.
The
air
was
big
with
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
fortunes
to-night
:
every
word
everywhere
concerned
her
.
*NL*
When
they
were
quite
out
of
earshot
all
by
one
instinct
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
gave
me
quite
a
turn
--
his
face
,
''
said
Tall
,
breathing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
it
did
me
,
''
said
Samway
.
``
What
's
to
be
done
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
see
that
't
is
any
business
of
ours
,
''
Smallbury
murmured
*NL*
dubiously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
!
'T
is
a
thing
which
is
everybody
's
business
,
''
said
*NL*
Samway
.
``
We
know
very
well
that
master
's
on
a
wrong
tack
,
and
that
*NL*
she
's
quite
in
the
dark
,
and
we
should
let
'em
know
at
once
.
Laban
,
*NL*
you
know
her
best
--
you
'd
better
go
and
ask
to
speak
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bai
n't
fit
for
any
such
thing
,
''
said
Laban
,
nervously
.
``
I
should
*NL*
think
William
ought
to
do
it
if
anybody
.
He
's
oldest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
have
nothing
to
do
with
it
,
''
said
Smallbury
.
''
'T
is
a
*NL*
ticklish
business
altogether
.
Why
,
he
'll
go
on
to
her
himself
in
a
*NL*
few
minutes
,
ye
'll
see
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
do
n't
know
that
he
will
.
Come
,
Laban
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
if
I
must
I
must
,
I
suppose
,
''
Tall
reluctantly
answered
.
*NL*
``
What
must
I
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
ask
to
see
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
;
I
sha
n't
speak
to
Mr.
Boldwood
.
If
I
tell
anybody
,
`
twill
be
*NL*
mistress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
said
Samway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Laban
then
went
to
the
door
.
When
he
opened
it
the
hum
of
bustle
*NL*
rolled
out
as
a
wave
upon
a
still
strand
--
the
assemblage
being
*NL*
immediately
inside
the
hall
--
and
was
deadened
to
a
murmur
as
he
*NL*
closed
it
again
.
Each
man
waited
intently
,
and
looked
around
at
*NL*
the
dark
tree
tops
gently
rocking
against
the
sky
and
occasionally
*NL*
shivering
in
a
slight
wind
,
as
if
he
took
interest
in
the
scene
,
*NL*
which
neither
did
.
One
of
them
began
walking
up
and
down
,
and
then
*NL*
came
to
where
he
started
from
and
stopped
again
,
with
a
sense
that
*NL*
walking
was
a
thing
not
worth
doing
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
think
Laban
must
have
seen
mistress
by
this
time
,
''
said
*NL*
Smallbury
,
breaking
the
silence
.
``
Perhaps
she
wo
n't
come
and
speak
*NL*
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
.
Tall
appeared
,
and
joined
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
?
''
said
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
like
to
ask
for
her
after
all
,
''
Laban
faltered
out
.
``
They
*NL*
were
all
in
such
a
stir
,
trying
to
put
a
little
spirit
into
the
*NL*
party
.
Somehow
the
fun
seems
to
hang
fire
,
though
everything
's
there
*NL*
that
a
heart
can
desire
,
and
I
could
n't
for
my
soul
interfere
and
*NL*
throw
damp
upon
it
--
if
't
was
to
save
my
life
,
I
could
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
we
had
better
all
go
in
together
,
''
said
Samway
,
gloomily
.
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
may
have
a
chance
of
saying
a
word
to
master
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
men
entered
the
hall
,
which
was
the
room
selected
and
arranged
*NL*
for
the
gathering
because
of
its
size
.
The
younger
men
and
maids
*NL*
were
at
last
just
beginning
to
dance
.
Bathsheba
had
been
perplexed
*NL*
how
to
act
,
for
she
was
not
much
more
than
a
slim
young
maid
herself
,
*NL*
and
the
weight
of
stateliness
sat
heavy
upon
her
.
Sometimes
she
*NL*
thought
she
ought
not
to
have
come
under
any
circumstances
;
then
she
*NL*
considered
what
cold
unkindness
that
would
have
been
,
and
finally
*NL*
resolved
upon
the
middle
course
of
staying
for
about
an
hour
only
,
*NL*
and
gliding
off
unobserved
,
having
from
the
first
made
up
her
mind
*NL*
that
she
could
on
no
account
dance
,
sing
,
or
take
any
active
part
in
*NL*
the
proceedings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
allotted
hour
having
been
passed
in
chatting
and
looking
on
,
*NL*
Bathsheba
told
Liddy
not
to
hurry
herself
,
and
went
to
the
small
*NL*
parlour
to
prepare
for
departure
,
which
,
like
the
hall
,
was
decorated
*NL*
with
holly
and
ivy
,
and
well
lighted
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
was
in
the
room
,
but
she
had
hardly
been
there
a
moment
when
*NL*
the
master
of
the
house
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Troy
--
you
are
not
going
?
''
he
said
.
``
We
've
hardly
begun
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
'll
excuse
me
,
I
should
like
to
go
now
.
''
Her
manner
was
*NL*
restive
,
for
she
remembered
her
promise
,
and
imagined
what
he
was
*NL*
about
to
say
.
``
But
as
it
is
not
late
,
''
she
added
,
``
I
can
walk
home
,
*NL*
and
leave
my
man
and
Liddy
to
come
when
they
choose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
trying
to
get
an
opportunity
of
speaking
to
you
,
''
said
*NL*
Boldwood
.
``
You
know
perhaps
what
I
long
to
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
silently
looked
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
give
it
?
''
he
said
,
eagerly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
that
's
evasion
!
Why
,
the
promise
.
I
do
n't
want
to
intrude
*NL*
upon
you
at
all
,
or
to
let
it
become
known
to
anybody
.
But
do
give
*NL*
your
word
!
A
mere
business
compact
,
you
know
,
between
two
people
who
*NL*
are
beyond
the
influence
of
passion
.
''
Boldwood
knew
how
false
this
*NL*
picture
was
as
regarded
himself
;
but
he
had
proved
that
it
was
the
*NL*
only
tone
in
which
she
would
allow
him
to
approach
her
.
``
A
promise
*NL*
to
marry
me
at
the
end
of
five
years
and
three-quarters
.
You
owe
it
*NL*
to
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
feel
that
I
do
,
''
said
Bathsheba
;
``
that
is
,
if
you
demand
it
.
But
*NL*
I
am
a
changed
woman
--
an
unhappy
woman
--
and
not
--
not
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
still
a
very
beautiful
woman
,
''
said
Boldwood
.
Honesty
and
*NL*
pure
conviction
suggested
the
remark
,
unaccompanied
by
any
perception
*NL*
that
it
might
have
been
adopted
by
blunt
flattery
to
soothe
and
win
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
,
it
had
not
much
effect
now
,
for
she
said
,
in
a
passionless
*NL*
murmur
which
was
in
itself
a
proof
of
her
words
:
``
I
have
no
feeling
*NL*
in
the
matter
at
all
.
And
I
do
n't
at
all
know
what
is
right
to
do
*NL*
in
my
difficult
position
,
and
I
have
nobody
to
advise
me
.
But
I
*NL*
give
my
promise
,
if
I
must
.
I
give
it
as
the
rendering
of
a
debt
,
*NL*
conditionally
,
of
course
,
on
my
being
a
widow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
marry
me
between
five
and
six
years
hence
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
press
me
too
hard
.
I
'll
marry
nobody
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
surely
you
will
name
the
time
,
or
there
's
nothing
in
the
promise
*NL*
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
know
,
pray
let
me
go
!
''
she
said
,
her
bosom
beginning
to
*NL*
rise
.
``
I
am
afraid
what
to
do
!
I
want
to
be
just
to
you
,
and
to
be
*NL*
that
seems
to
be
wronging
myself
,
and
perhaps
it
is
breaking
the
*NL*
commandments
.
There
is
considerable
doubt
of
his
death
,
and
then
it
*NL*
is
dreadful
;
let
me
ask
a
solicitor
,
Mr.
Boldwood
,
if
I
ought
or
no

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
the
words

one

subject
shall
be
dismissed

a
blissful
loving
intimacy
of
six
years
,
and
then
marriage
--
O
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
say
them
!
''
he
begged
in
a
husky
voice
,
unable
to
sustain
*NL*
the
forms
of
mere
friendship
any
longer
.
``
Promise
yourself
to
me

I
*NL*
deserve
it

indeed
I
do
,
for
I
have
loved
you
more
than
anybody
in
*NL*
the
world
!
And
if
I
said
hasty
words
and
showed
uncalled-for
heat
*NL*
of
manner
towards
you
,
believe
me
,
dear
,
I
did
not
mean
to
distress
*NL*
you

I
was
in
agony

Bathsheba

I
did
not

what
I
said

would

let
a
dog
suffer
what
I
have
suffered

you

know
*NL*
it

Sometimes
I
shrink
from
your
knowing
what
I
have
felt
for
you

*NL*
and
sometimes
I
am
distressed
that
all
of
it
you
never
will
know

Be
*NL*
gracious
,
and
give
up
a
little
to
me

I
would
give
up
my
life

*NL*
*NL*
The
trimmings
of
her
dress
,
as
they
quivered
against
the
light
,
*NL*
showed
how
agitated
she
was
,
and
at
last
she
burst
out
crying
.
``
And
*NL*
you
'll
not

press
me

about
anything
more

I
say
in
five

six
*NL*
years

she
sobbed
,
when
she
had
power
to
frame
the
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
then
I
'll
leave
it
to
time

*NL*
*NL*
She
waited
a
moment
.
``
Very
well

I
'll
marry
you
in
six
years
from
*NL*
this
day
,
if
we
both
live

she
said
solemnly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
'll
take
this
as
a
token
from
me

*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
had
come
close
to
her
side
,
and
now
he
clasped
one
of
her
*NL*
hands
in
both
his
own
,
and
lifted
it
to
his
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
?
Oh
I
can
not
wear
a
ring

she
exclaimed
,
on
seeing
*NL*
what
he
held
;
``
besides
,
I
would
n't
have
a
soul
know
that
it
's
an
*NL*
engagement
!
Perhaps
it
is
improper
?
Besides

we
are
not
engaged
in
*NL*
the
usual
sense

are
we

Do
n't
insist

Mr.
Boldwood

do

In
her
*NL*
trouble
at
not
being
able
to
get
her
hand
away
from
him
at
once
,
she
*NL*
stamped
passionately
on
the
floor
with
one
foot
,
and
tears
crowded
to
*NL*
her
eyes
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
means
simply
a
pledge
--
no
sentiment
--
the
seal
of
a
practical
*NL*
compact

he
said
more
quietly
,
but
still
retaining
her
hand
in
*NL*
his
firm
grasp
.
``
Come
,
now
!

And
Boldwood
slipped
the
ring
on
her
*NL*
finger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
wear
it

she
said
,
weeping
as
if
her
heart
would
break
.
*NL*
``
You
frighten
me

almost

So
wild
a
scheme

Please
let
me
go
home

*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
to-night

wear
it
just
to-night

please
me

*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
sat
down
in
a
chair
,
and
buried
her
face
in
her
*NL*
handkerchief
,
though
Boldwood
kept
her
hand
yet
.
At
length
she
*NL*
said
,
in
a
sort
of
hopeless
whisper
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well

to-night

end
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
must
be
,
I
suppose
,
since
you
will
have
it
so
!
''
she
said
,
fairly
*NL*
beaten
into
non-resistance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
pressed
her
hand
,
and
allowed
it
to
drop
in
her
lap
.
``
I
am
*NL*
happy
now
,
''
he
said
.
``
God
bless
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
left
the
room
,
and
when
he
thought
she
might
be
sufficiently
*NL*
composed
sent
one
of
the
maids
to
her
.
Bathsheba
cloaked
the
effects
*NL*
of
the
late
scene
as
she
best
could
,
followed
the
girl
,
and
in
a
few
*NL*
moments
came
downstairs
with
her
hat
and
cloak
on
,
ready
to
go
.
To
*NL*
get
to
the
door
it
was
necessary
to
pass
through
the
hall
,
and
before
*NL*
doing
so
she
paused
on
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
which
descended
*NL*
into
one
corner
,
to
take
a
last
look
at
the
gathering
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
music
or
dancing
in
progress
just
now
.
At
the
lower
*NL*
end
,
which
had
been
arranged
for
the
work-folk
specially
,
a
group
*NL*
conversed
in
whispers
,
and
with
clouded
looks
.
Boldwood
was
standing
*NL*
by
the
fireplace
,
and
he
,
too
,
though
so
absorbed
in
visions
arising
*NL*
from
her
promise
that
he
scarcely
saw
anything
,
seemed
at
that
moment
*NL*
to
have
observed
their
peculiar
manner
,
and
their
looks
askance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
it
you
are
in
doubt
about
,
men
?
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
turned
and
replied
uneasily
:
``
It
was
something
Laban
*NL*
heard
of
,
that
's
all
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
News
?
Anybody
married
or
engaged
,
born
or
dead
?
''
inquired
the
*NL*
farmer
,
gaily
.
``
Tell
it
to
us
,
Tall
.
One
would
think
from
your
*NL*
looks
and
mysterious
ways
that
it
was
something
very
dreadful
*NL*
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
sir
,
nobody
is
dead
,
''
said
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
somebody
was
,
''
said
Samway
,
in
a
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
say
,
Samway
?
''
asked
Boldwood
,
somewhat
sharply
.
``
If
you
*NL*
have
anything
to
say
,
speak
out
;
if
not
,
get
up
another
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Troy
has
come
downstairs
,
''
said
Samway
to
Tall
.
``
If
you
want
*NL*
to
tell
her
,
you
had
better
do
it
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
what
they
mean
?
''
the
farmer
asked
Bathsheba
,
across
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
in
the
least
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
smart
rapping
at
the
door
.
One
of
the
men
opened
it
*NL*
instantly
,
and
went
outside
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Troy
is
wanted
,
''
he
said
,
on
returning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
ready
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
``
Though
I
did
n't
tell
them
to
send
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
stranger
,
ma'am
,
''
said
the
man
by
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
stranger
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ask
him
to
come
in
,
''
said
Boldwood
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
message
was
given
,
and
Troy
,
wrapped
up
to
his
eyes
as
we
have
*NL*
seen
him
,
stood
in
the
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
unearthly
silence
,
all
looking
towards
the
newcomer
.
*NL*
Those
who
had
just
learnt
that
he
was
in
the
neighbourhood
recognized
*NL*
him
instantly
;
those
who
did
not
were
perplexed
.
Nobody
noted
*NL*
Bathsheba
.
She
was
leaning
on
the
stairs
.
Her
brow
had
heavily
*NL*
contracted
;
her
whole
face
was
pallid
,
her
lips
apart
,
her
eyes
*NL*
rigidly
staring
at
their
visitor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
was
among
those
who
did
not
notice
that
he
was
Troy
.
``
Come
*NL*
in
,
come
in
!
''
he
repeated
,
cheerfully
,
``
and
drain
a
Christmas
beaker
*NL*
with
us
,
stranger
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
next
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
room
,
took
off
his
cap
,
*NL*
turned
down
his
coat-collar
,
and
looked
Boldwood
in
the
face
.
Even
*NL*
then
Boldwood
did
not
recognize
that
the
impersonator
of
Heaven
's
*NL*
persistent
irony
towards
him
,
who
had
once
before
broken
in
upon
his
*NL*
bliss
,
scourged
him
,
and
snatched
his
delight
away
,
had
come
to
do
*NL*
these
things
a
second
time
.
Troy
began
to
laugh
a
mechanical
laugh
:
*NL*
Boldwood
recognized
him
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
turned
to
Bathsheba
.
The
poor
girl
's
wretchedness
at
this
time
*NL*
was
beyond
all
fancy
or
narration
.
She
had
sunk
down
on
the
lowest
*NL*
stair
;
and
there
she
sat
,
her
mouth
blue
and
dry
,
and
her
dark
eyes
*NL*
fixed
vacantly
upon
him
,
as
if
she
wondered
whether
it
were
not
all
*NL*
a
terrible
illusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Troy
spoke
.
``
Bathsheba
,
I
come
here
for
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
no
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
home
with
me
:
come
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
moved
her
feet
a
little
,
but
did
not
rise
.
Troy
went
*NL*
across
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
madam
,
do
you
hear
what
I
say
?
''
he
said
,
peremptorily
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
strange
voice
came
from
the
fireplace
--
a
voice
sounding
far
off
*NL*
and
confined
,
as
if
from
a
dungeon
.
Hardly
a
soul
in
the
assembly
*NL*
recognized
the
thin
tones
to
be
those
of
Boldwood
.
Sudden
despair
*NL*
had
transformed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bathsheba
,
go
with
your
husband
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
she
did
not
move
.
The
truth
was
that
Bathsheba
was
*NL*
beyond
the
pale
of
activity
--
and
yet
not
in
a
swoon
.
She
was
in
a
*NL*
state
of
mental
_
gutta
serena
_
;
her
mind
was
for
the
minute
totally
*NL*
deprived
of
light
at
the
same
time
no
obscuration
was
apparent
from
*NL*
without
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
stretched
out
his
hand
to
pull
her
her
towards
him
,
when
she
*NL*
quickly
shrank
back
.
This
visible
dread
of
him
seemed
to
irritate
*NL*
Troy
,
and
he
seized
her
arm
and
pulled
it
sharply
.
Whether
his
grasp
*NL*
pinched
her
,
or
whether
his
mere
touch
was
the
cause
,
was
never
*NL*
known
,
but
at
the
moment
of
his
seizure
she
writhed
,
and
gave
a
*NL*
quick
,
low
scream
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scream
had
been
heard
but
a
few
seconds
when
it
was
followed
by
*NL*
sudden
deafening
report
that
echoed
through
the
room
and
stupefied
*NL*
them
all
.
The
oak
partition
shook
with
the
concussion
,
and
the
place
*NL*
was
filled
with
grey
smoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
bewilderment
they
turned
their
eyes
to
Boldwood
.
At
his
back
,
*NL*
as
stood
before
the
fireplace
,
was
a
gun-rack
,
as
is
usual
in
*NL*
farmhouses
,
constructed
to
hold
two
guns
.
When
Bathsheba
had
cried
*NL*
out
in
her
husband
's
grasp
,
Boldwood
's
face
of
gnashing
despair
had
*NL*
changed
.
The
veins
had
swollen
,
and
a
frenzied
look
had
gleamed
in
*NL*
his
eye
.
He
had
turned
quickly
,
taken
one
of
the
guns
,
cocked
it
,
*NL*
and
at
once
discharged
it
at
Troy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Troy
fell
.
The
distance
apart
of
the
two
men
was
so
small
that
*NL*
the
charge
of
shot
did
not
spread
in
the
least
,
but
passed
like
a
*NL*
bullet
into
his
body
.
He
uttered
a
long
guttural
sigh
--
there
was
*NL*
a
contraction
--
an
extension
--
then
his
muscles
relaxed
,
and
he
lay
*NL*
still
.
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
was
seen
through
the
smoke
to
be
now
again
engaged
with
the
*NL*
gun
.
It
was
double-barrelled
,
and
he
had
,
meanwhile
,
in
some
way
*NL*
fastened
his
hand-kerchief
to
the
trigger
,
and
with
his
foot
on
the
*NL*
other
end
was
in
the
act
of
turning
the
second
barrel
upon
himself
.
*NL*
Samway
his
man
was
the
first
to
see
this
,
and
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
general
horror
darted
up
to
him
.
Boldwood
had
already
twitched
*NL*
the
handkerchief
,
and
the
gun
exploded
a
second
time
,
sending
its
*NL*
contents
,
by
a
timely
blow
from
Samway
,
into
the
beam
which
crossed
*NL*
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
makes
no
difference
!
''
Boldwood
gasped
.
``
There
is
another
*NL*
way
for
me
to
die
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
he
broke
from
Samway
,
crossed
the
room
to
Bathsheba
,
and
kissed
*NL*
her
hand
.
He
put
on
his
hat
,
opened
the
door
,
and
went
into
the
*NL*
darkness
,
nobody
thinking
of
preventing
him
.

CHAPTER
LIV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
AFTER
THE
SHOCK
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Boldwood
passed
into
the
high
road
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
*NL*
Casterbridge
.
Here
he
walked
at
an
even
,
steady
pace
over
Yalbury
*NL*
Hill
,
along
the
dead
level
beyond
,
mounted
Mellstock
Hill
,
and
*NL*
between
eleven
and
twelve
o'clock
crossed
the
Moor
into
the
town
.
*NL*
The
streets
were
nearly
deserted
now
,
and
the
waving
lamp-flames
only
*NL*
lighted
up
rows
of
grey
shop-shutters
,
and
strips
of
white
paving
*NL*
upon
which
his
step
echoed
as
his
passed
along
.
He
turned
to
the
*NL*
right
,
and
halted
before
an
archway
of
heavy
stonework
,
which
was
*NL*
closed
by
an
iron
studded
pair
of
doors
.
This
was
the
entrance
*NL*
to
the
gaol
,
and
over
it
a
lamp
was
fixed
,
the
light
enabling
the
*NL*
wretched
traveller
to
find
a
bell-pull
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
wicket
at
last
opened
,
and
a
porter
appeared
.
Boldwood
*NL*
stepped
forward
,
and
said
something
in
a
low
tone
,
when
,
after
a
*NL*
delay
,
another
man
came
.
Boldwood
entered
,
and
the
door
was
closed
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
he
walked
the
world
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Long
before
this
time
Weatherbury
had
been
thoroughly
aroused
,
and
*NL*
the
wild
deed
which
had
terminated
Boldwood
's
merrymaking
became
*NL*
known
to
all
.
Of
those
out
of
the
house
Oak
was
one
of
the
first
to
*NL*
hear
of
the
catastrophe
,
and
when
he
entered
the
room
,
which
was
*NL*
about
five
minutes
after
Boldwood
's
exit
,
the
scene
was
terrible
.
*NL*
All
the
female
guests
were
huddled
aghast
against
the
walls
like
*NL*
sheep
in
a
storm
,
and
the
men
were
bewildered
as
to
what
to
do
.
As
*NL*
for
Bathsheba
,
she
had
changed
.
She
was
sitting
on
the
floor
beside
*NL*
the
body
of
Troy
,
his
head
pillowed
in
her
lap
,
where
she
had
herself
*NL*
lifted
it
.
With
one
hand
she
held
her
handkerchief
to
his
breast
and
*NL*
covered
the
wound
,
though
scarcely
a
single
drop
of
blood
had
flowed
,
*NL*
and
with
the
other
she
tightly
clasped
one
of
his
.
The
household
*NL*
convulsion
had
made
her
herself
again
.
The
temporary
coma
had
*NL*
ceased
,
and
activity
had
come
with
the
necessity
for
it
.
Deeds
of
*NL*
endurance
,
which
seem
ordinary
in
philosophy
,
are
rare
in
conduct
,
*NL*
and
Bathsheba
was
astonishing
all
around
her
now
,
for
her
philosophy
*NL*
was
her
conduct
,
and
she
seldom
thought
practicable
what
she
did
*NL*
not
practise
.
She
was
of
the
stuff
of
which
great
men
's
mothers
*NL*
are
made
.
She
was
indispensable
to
high
generation
,
hated
at
tea
*NL*
parties
,
feared
in
shops
,
and
loved
at
crises
.
Troy
recumbent
in
*NL*
his
wife
's
lap
formed
now
the
sole
spectacle
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
spacious
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gabriel
,
''
she
said
,
automatically
,
when
he
entered
,
turning
up
a
*NL*
face
of
which
only
the
well-known
lines
remained
to
tell
him
it
*NL*
was
hers
,
all
else
in
the
picture
having
faded
quite
.
``
Ride
to
*NL*
Casterbridge
instantly
for
a
surgeon
.
It
is
,
I
believe
,
useless
,
*NL*
but
go
.
Mr.
Boldwood
has
shot
my
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
statement
of
the
fact
in
such
quiet
and
simple
words
came
with
*NL*
more
force
than
a
tragic
declamation
,
and
had
somewhat
the
effect
of
*NL*
setting
the
distorted
images
in
each
mind
present
into
proper
focus
.
*NL*
Oak
,
almost
before
he
had
comprehended
anything
beyond
the
briefest
*NL*
abstract
of
the
event
,
hurried
out
of
the
room
,
saddled
a
horse
and
*NL*
rode
away
.
Not
till
he
had
ridden
more
than
a
mile
did
it
occur
to
*NL*
him
that
he
would
have
done
better
by
sending
some
other
man
on
this
*NL*
errand
,
remaining
himself
in
the
house
.
What
had
become
of
Boldwood
?
*NL*
He
should
have
been
looked
after
.
Was
he
mad
--
had
there
been
a
*NL*
quarrel
?
Then
how
had
Troy
got
there
?
Where
had
he
come
from
?
How
*NL*
did
this
remarkable
reappearance
effect
itself
when
he
was
supposed
*NL*
by
many
to
be
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
?
Oak
had
in
some
slight
*NL*
measure
been
prepared
for
the
presence
of
Troy
by
hearing
a
rumour
*NL*
of
his
return
just
before
entering
Boldwood
's
house
;
but
before
he
*NL*
had
weighed
that
information
,
this
fatal
event
had
been
superimposed
.
*NL*
However
,
it
was
too
late
now
to
think
of
sending
another
messenger
,
*NL*
and
he
rode
on
,
in
the
excitement
of
these
self-inquiries
*NL*
not
discerning
,
when
about
three
miles
from
Casterbridge
,
a
*NL*
square-figured
pedestrian
passing
along
under
the
dark
hedge
in
the
*NL*
same
direction
as
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
miles
necessary
to
be
traversed
,
and
other
hindrances
incidental
*NL*
to
the
lateness
of
the
hour
and
the
darkness
of
the
night
,
delayed
*NL*
the
arrival
of
Mr.
Aldritch
,
the
surgeon
;
and
more
than
three
hours
*NL*
passed
between
the
time
at
which
the
shot
was
fired
and
that
of
his
*NL*
entering
the
house
.
Oak
was
additionally
detained
in
Casterbridge
*NL*
through
having
to
give
notice
to
the
authorities
of
what
had
*NL*
happened
;
and
he
then
found
that
Boldwood
had
also
entered
the
town
,
*NL*
and
delivered
himself
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
meantime
the
surgeon
,
having
hastened
into
the
hall
at
*NL*
Boldwood
's
,
found
it
in
darkness
and
quite
deserted
.
He
went
on
to
*NL*
the
back
of
the
house
,
where
he
discovered
in
the
kitchen
an
old
man
,
*NL*
of
whom
he
made
inquiries
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
had
him
took
away
to
her
own
house
,
sir
,
''
said
his
informant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
has
?
''
said
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Troy
.
'
A
was
quite
dead
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
astonishing
information
.
``
She
had
no
right
to
do
that
,
''
*NL*
said
the
doctor
.
``
There
will
have
to
be
an
inquest
,
and
she
should
*NL*
have
waited
to
know
what
to
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
;
it
was
hinted
to
her
that
she
had
better
wait
till
the
law
*NL*
was
known
.
But
she
said
law
was
nothing
to
her
,
and
she
would
n't
let
*NL*
her
dear
husband
's
corpse
bide
neglected
for
folks
to
stare
at
for
*NL*
all
the
crowners
in
England
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Aldritch
drove
at
once
back
again
up
the
hill
to
Bathsheba
's
.
*NL*
The
first
person
he
met
was
poor
Liddy
,
who
seemed
literally
to
have
*NL*
dwindled
smaller
in
these
few
latter
hours
.
``
What
has
been
done
?
''
he
*NL*
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
,
sir
,
''
said
Liddy
,
with
suspended
breath
.
``
My
mistress
*NL*
has
done
it
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
is
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upstairs
with
him
,
sir
.
When
he
was
brought
home
and
taken
*NL*
upstairs
,
she
said
she
wanted
no
further
help
from
the
men
.
And
then
*NL*
she
called
me
,
and
made
me
fill
the
bath
,
and
after
that
told
me
I
*NL*
had
better
go
and
lie
down
because
I
looked
so
ill
.
Then
she
locked
*NL*
herself
into
the
room
alone
with
him
,
and
would
not
let
a
nurse
come
*NL*
in
,
or
anybody
at
all
.
But
I
thought
I
'd
wait
in
the
next
room
in
*NL*
case
she
should
want
me
.
I
heard
her
moving
about
inside
for
more
*NL*
than
an
hour
,
but
she
only
came
out
once
,
and
that
was
for
more
*NL*
candles
,
because
hers
had
burnt
down
into
the
socket
.
She
said
we
*NL*
were
to
let
her
know
when
you
or
Mr.
Thirdly
came
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
entered
with
the
parson
at
this
moment
,
and
they
all
went
*NL*
upstairs
together
,
preceded
by
Liddy
Smallbury
.
Everything
was
*NL*
silent
as
the
grave
when
they
paused
on
the
landing
.
Liddy
knocked
,
*NL*
and
Bathsheba
's
dress
was
heard
rustling
across
the
room
:
the
key
*NL*
turned
in
the
lock
,
and
she
opened
the
door
.
Her
looks
were
calm
and
*NL*
nearly
rigid
,
like
a
slightly
animated
bust
of
Melpomene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Mr.
Aldritch
,
you
have
come
at
last
,
''
she
murmured
from
her
lips
*NL*
merely
,
and
threw
back
the
door
.
``
Ah
,
and
Mr.
Thirdly
.
Well
,
all
is
*NL*
done
,
and
anybody
in
the
world
may
see
him
now
.
''
She
then
passed
by
*NL*
him
,
crossed
the
landing
,
and
entered
another
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Looking
into
the
chamber
of
death
she
had
vacated
they
saw
by
the
*NL*
light
of
the
candles
which
were
on
the
drawers
a
tall
straight
*NL*
shape
lying
at
the
further
end
of
the
bedroom
,
wrapped
in
white
.
*NL*
Everything
around
was
quite
orderly
.
The
doctor
went
in
,
and
after
a
*NL*
few
minutes
returned
to
the
landing
again
,
where
Oak
and
the
parson
*NL*
still
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
all
done
,
indeed
,
as
she
says
,
''
remarked
Mr.
Aldritch
,
in
a
*NL*
subdued
voice
.
``
The
body
has
been
undressed
and
properly
laid
out
in
*NL*
grave
clothes
.
Gracious
Heaven
--
this
mere
girl
!
She
must
have
the
*NL*
nerve
of
a
stoic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
heart
of
a
wife
merely
,
''
floated
in
a
whisper
about
the
ears
*NL*
of
the
three
,
and
turning
they
saw
Bathsheba
in
the
midst
of
them
.
*NL*
Then
,
as
if
at
that
instant
to
prove
that
her
fortitude
had
been
*NL*
more
of
will
than
of
spontaneity
,
she
silently
sank
down
between
*NL*
them
and
was
a
shapeless
heap
of
drapery
on
the
floor
.
The
simple
*NL*
consciousness
that
superhuman
strain
was
no
longer
required
had
at
*NL*
once
put
a
period
to
her
power
to
continue
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
her
away
into
a
further
room
,
and
the
medical
attendance
*NL*
which
had
been
useless
in
Troy
's
case
was
invaluable
in
Bathsheba
's
,
*NL*
who
fell
into
a
series
of
fainting-fits
that
had
a
serious
aspect
*NL*
for
a
time
.
The
sufferer
was
got
to
bed
,
and
Oak
,
finding
from
the
*NL*
bulletins
that
nothing
really
dreadful
was
to
be
apprehended
on
her
*NL*
score
,
left
the
house
.
Liddy
kept
watch
in
Bathsheba
's
chamber
,
*NL*
where
she
heard
her
mistress
,
moaning
in
whispers
through
the
dull
*NL*
slow
hours
of
that
wretched
night
:
``
Oh
it
is
my
fault
--
how
can
I
*NL*
live
!
O
Heaven
,
how
can
I
live
!

CHAPTER
LV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
THE
MARCH
FOLLOWING
--
``
BATHSHEBA
BOLDWOOD
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
We
pass
rapidly
on
into
the
month
of
March
,
to
a
breezy
day
without
*NL*
sunshine
,
frost
,
or
dew
.
On
Yalbury
Hill
,
about
midway
between
*NL*
Weatherbury
and
Casterbridge
,
where
the
turnpike
road
passes
over
*NL*
the
crest
,
a
numerous
concourse
of
people
had
gathered
,
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
greater
number
being
frequently
stretched
afar
in
a
northerly
*NL*
direction
.
The
groups
consisted
of
a
throng
of
idlers
,
a
party
of
*NL*
javelin-men
,
and
two
trumpeters
,
and
in
the
midst
were
carriages
,
one
*NL*
of
which
contained
the
high
sheriff
.
With
the
idlers
,
many
of
whom
*NL*
had
mounted
to
the
top
of
a
cutting
formed
for
the
road
,
were
several
*NL*
Weatherbury
men
and
boys
--
among
others
Poorgrass
,
Coggan
,
and
Cain
*NL*
Ball
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
half-an-hour
a
faint
dust
was
seen
in
the
expected
*NL*
quarter
,
and
shortly
after
a
travelling-carriage
,
bringing
one
of
the
*NL*
two
judges
on
the
Western
Circuit
,
came
up
the
hill
and
halted
on
the
*NL*
top
.
The
judge
changed
carriages
whilst
a
flourish
was
blown
by
the
*NL*
big-cheeked
trumpeters
,
and
a
procession
being
formed
of
the
vehicles
*NL*
and
javelin-men
,
they
all
proceeded
towards
the
town
,
excepting
the
*NL*
Weatherbury
men
,
who
as
soon
as
they
had
seen
the
judge
move
off
*NL*
returned
home
again
to
their
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Joseph
,
I
seed
you
squeezing
close
to
the
carriage
,
''
said
Coggan
,
as
*NL*
they
walked
.
``
Did
ye
notice
my
lord
judge
's
face
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
,
''
said
Poorgrass
.
``
I
looked
hard
at
en
,
as
if
I
would
read
*NL*
his
very
soul
;
and
there
was
mercy
in
his
eyes
--
or
to
speak
with
the
*NL*
exact
truth
required
of
us
at
this
solemn
time
,
in
the
eye
that
was
*NL*
towards
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
hope
for
the
best
,
''
said
Coggan
,
``
though
bad
that
must
be
.
*NL*
However
,
I
sha
n't
go
to
the
trial
,
and
I
'd
advise
the
rest
of
ye
*NL*
that
bai
n't
wanted
to
bide
away
.
`
Twill
disturb
his
mind
more
than
*NL*
anything
to
see
us
there
staring
at
him
as
if
he
were
a
show
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
very
thing
I
said
this
morning
,
''
observed
Joseph
,
''
`
Justice
is
*NL*
come
to
weigh
him
in
the
balances
,
'
I
said
in
my
reflectious
way
,
*NL*
`
and
if
he
's
found
wanting
,
so
be
it
unto
him
,
'
and
a
bystander
said
*NL*
`
Hear
,
hear
!
A
man
who
can
talk
like
that
ought
to
be
heard
.
'
But
I
*NL*
do
n't
like
dwelling
upon
it
,
for
my
few
words
are
my
few
words
,
and
*NL*
not
much
;
though
the
speech
of
some
men
is
rumoured
abroad
as
though
*NL*
by
nature
formed
for
such
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
't
is
,
Joseph
.
And
now
,
neighbours
,
as
I
said
,
every
man
bide
at
*NL*
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
resolution
was
adhered
to
;
and
all
waited
anxiously
for
the
news
*NL*
next
day
.
Their
suspense
was
diverted
,
however
,
by
a
discovery
which
*NL*
was
made
in
the
afternoon
,
throwing
more
light
on
Boldwood
's
conduct
*NL*
and
condition
than
any
details
which
had
preceded
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
he
had
been
from
the
time
of
Greenhill
Fair
until
the
fatal
*NL*
Christmas
Eve
in
excited
and
unusual
moods
was
known
to
those
who
had
*NL*
been
intimate
with
him
;
but
nobody
imagined
that
there
had
shown
in
*NL*
him
unequivocal
symptoms
of
the
mental
derangement
which
Bathsheba
*NL*
and
Oak
,
alone
of
all
others
and
at
different
times
,
had
momentarily
*NL*
suspected
.
In
a
locked
closet
was
now
discovered
an
extraordinary
*NL*
collection
of
articles
.
There
were
several
sets
of
ladies
'
dresses
*NL*
in
the
piece
,
of
sundry
expensive
materials
;
silks
and
satins
,
*NL*
poplins
and
velvets
,
all
of
colours
which
from
Bathsheba
's
style
of
*NL*
dress
might
have
been
judged
to
be
her
favourites
.
There
were
two
*NL*
muffs
,
sable
and
ermine
.
Above
all
there
was
a
case
of
jewellery
,
*NL*
containing
four
heavy
gold
bracelets
and
several
lockets
and
rings
,
*NL*
all
of
fine
quality
and
manufacture
.
These
things
had
been
bought
in
*NL*
Bath
and
other
towns
from
time
to
time
,
and
brought
home
by
stealth
.
*NL*
They
were
all
carefully
packed
in
paper
,
and
each
package
was
*NL*
labelled
``
Bathsheba
Boldwood
,
''
a
date
being
subjoined
six
years
in
*NL*
advance
in
every
instance
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
somewhat
pathetic
evidences
of
a
mind
crazed
with
care
and
love
*NL*
were
the
subject
of
discourse
in
Warren
's
malt-house
when
Oak
entered
*NL*
from
Casterbridge
with
tidings
of
sentence
.
He
came
in
the
afternoon
,
*NL*
and
his
face
,
as
the
kiln
glow
shone
upon
it
,
told
the
tale
*NL*
sufficiently
well
.
Boldwood
,
as
every
one
supposed
he
would
do
,
had
*NL*
pleaded
guilty
,
and
had
been
sentenced
to
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conviction
that
Boldwood
had
not
been
morally
responsible
for
his
*NL*
later
acts
now
became
general
.
Facts
elicited
previous
to
the
trial
*NL*
had
pointed
strongly
in
the
same
direction
,
but
they
had
not
been
of
*NL*
sufficient
weight
to
lead
to
an
order
for
an
examination
into
the
*NL*
state
of
Boldwood
's
mind
.
It
was
astonishing
,
now
that
a
presumption
*NL*
of
insanity
was
raised
,
how
many
collateral
circumstances
were
*NL*
remembered
to
which
a
condition
of
mental
disease
seemed
to
afford
*NL*
the
only
explanation
--
among
others
,
the
unprecedented
neglect
of
his
*NL*
corn
stacks
in
the
previous
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
petition
was
addressed
to
the
Home
Secretary
,
advancing
*NL*
the
circumstances
which
appeared
to
justify
a
request
for
a
*NL*
reconsideration
of
the
sentence
.
It
was
not
``
numerously
signed
''
*NL*
by
the
inhabitants
of
Casterbridge
,
as
is
usual
in
such
cases
,
for
*NL*
Boldwood
had
never
made
many
friends
over
the
counter
.
The
shops
*NL*
thought
it
very
natural
that
a
man
who
,
by
importing
direct
from
*NL*
the
producer
,
had
daringly
set
aside
the
first
great
principle
of
*NL*
provincial
existence
,
namely
that
God
made
country
villages
to
supply
*NL*
customers
to
county
towns
,
should
have
confused
ideas
about
the
*NL*
Decalogue
.
The
prompters
were
a
few
merciful
men
who
had
perhaps
too
*NL*
feelingly
considered
the
facts
latterly
unearthed
,
and
the
result
was
*NL*
that
evidence
was
taken
which
it
was
hoped
might
remove
the
crime
in
*NL*
a
moral
point
of
view
,
out
of
the
category
of
wilful
murder
,
and
lead
*NL*
it
to
be
regarded
as
a
sheer
outcome
of
madness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
upshot
of
the
petition
was
waited
for
in
Weatherbury
with
*NL*
solicitous
interest
.
The
execution
had
been
fixed
for
eight
o'clock
*NL*
on
a
Saturday
morning
about
a
fortnight
after
the
sentence
was
*NL*
passed
,
and
up
to
Friday
afternoon
no
answer
had
been
received
.
At
*NL*
that
time
Gabriel
came
from
Casterbridge
Gaol
,
whither
he
had
been
*NL*
to
wish
Boldwood
good-bye
,
and
turned
down
a
by-street
to
avoid
the
*NL*
town
.
When
past
the
last
house
he
heard
a
hammering
,
and
lifting
*NL*
his
bowed
head
he
looked
back
for
a
moment
.
Over
the
chimneys
he
*NL*
could
see
the
upper
part
of
the
gaol
entrance
,
rich
and
glowing
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
sun
,
and
some
moving
figures
were
there
.
They
*NL*
were
carpenters
lifting
a
post
into
a
vertical
position
within
the
*NL*
parapet
.
He
withdrew
his
eyes
quickly
,
and
hastened
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
dark
when
he
reached
home
,
and
half
the
village
was
out
to
*NL*
meet
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
tidings
,
''
Gabriel
said
,
wearily
.
``
And
I
'm
afraid
there
's
no
*NL*
hope
.
I
've
been
with
him
more
than
two
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
ye
think
he
REALLY
was
out
of
his
mind
when
he
did
it
?
''
said
*NL*
Smallbury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
honestly
say
that
I
do
,
''
Oak
replied
.
``
However
,
that
we
can
*NL*
talk

Has
there
been
any
change
in
mistress
this
*NL*
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
None
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
downstairs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
And
getting
on
so
nicely
as
she
was
too
.
She
's
but
very
little
*NL*
better
now
again
than
she
was
at
Christmas
.
She
keeps
on
asking
*NL*
if
you
be
come
,
and
if
there
's
news
,
till
one
's
wearied
out
wi
'
*NL*
answering
her
.
Shall
I
go
and
say
you
've
come
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Oak
.
``
There
's
a
chance
yet
;
but
I
could
n't
stay
in
town
*NL*
any
longer
--
after
seeing
him
too
.
So
Laban
--
Laban
is
here
,
is
n't
*NL*
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
I
've
arranged
is
,
that
you
shall
ride
to
town
the
last
thing
*NL*
to-night
;
leave
here
about
nine
,
and
wait
a
while
there
,
getting
home
*NL*
about
twelve
.
If
nothing
has
been
received
by
eleven
to-night
,
they
*NL*
say
there
's
no
chance
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
so
hope
his
life
will
be
spared
,
''
said
Liddy
.
``
If
it
is
not
,
*NL*
she
'll
go
out
of
her
mind
too
.
Poor
thing
;
her
sufferings
have
been
*NL*
dreadful
;
she
deserves
anybody
's
pity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
altered
much
?
''
said
Coggan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
have
n't
seen
poor
mistress
since
Christmas
,
you
would
n't
know
*NL*
her
,
''
said
Liddy
.
``
Her
eyes
are
so
miserable
that
she
's
not
the
same
*NL*
woman
.
Only
two
years
ago
she
was
a
romping
girl
,
and
now
she
's
*NL*
this
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Laban
departed
as
directed
,
and
at
eleven
o'clock
that
night
several
*NL*
of
the
villagers
strolled
along
the
road
to
Casterbridge
and
awaited
*NL*
his
arrival
--
among
them
Oak
,
and
nearly
all
the
rest
of
Bathsheba
's
*NL*
men
.
Gabriel
's
anxiety
was
great
that
Boldwood
might
be
saved
,
even
*NL*
though
in
his
conscience
he
felt
that
he
ought
to
die
;
for
there
had
*NL*
been
qualities
in
the
farmer
which
Oak
loved
.
At
last
,
when
they
all
*NL*
were
weary
the
tramp
of
a
horse
was
heard
in
the
distance
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
First
dead
,
as
if
on
turf
it
trode
,
*NL*
Then
,
clattering
on
the
village
road
*NL*
In
other
pace
than
forth
he
yode
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
soon
know
now
,
one
way
or
other
.
''
said
Coggan
,
and
they
all
*NL*
stepped
down
from
the
bank
on
which
they
had
been
standing
into
the
*NL*
road
,
and
the
rider
pranced
into
the
midst
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
that
you
,
Laban
?
''
said
Gabriel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
--
't
is
come
.
He
's
not
to
die
.
'T
is
confinement
during
Her
*NL*
Majesty
's
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hurrah
!
''
said
Coggan
,
with
a
swelling
heart
.
``
God
's
above
the

CHAPTER
LVI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
BEAUTY
IN
LONELINESS
--
AFTER
ALL
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
revived
with
the
spring
.
The
utter
prostration
that
*NL*
had
followed
the
low
fever
from
which
she
had
suffered
diminished
*NL*
perceptibly
when
all
uncertainty
upon
every
subject
had
come
to
*NL*
an
end
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
remained
alone
now
for
the
greater
part
of
her
time
,
and
*NL*
stayed
in
the
house
,
or
at
furthest
went
into
the
garden
.
She
*NL*
shunned
every
one
,
even
Liddy
,
and
could
be
brought
to
make
no
*NL*
confidences
,
and
to
ask
for
no
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
summer
drew
on
she
passed
more
of
her
time
in
the
open
air
,
*NL*
and
began
to
examine
into
farming
matters
from
sheer
necessity
,
*NL*
though
she
never
rode
out
or
personally
superintended
as
at
former
*NL*
times
.
One
Friday
evening
in
August
she
walked
a
little
way
along
*NL*
the
road
and
entered
the
village
for
the
first
time
since
the
sombre
*NL*
event
of
the
preceding
Christmas
.
None
of
the
old
colour
had
as
yet
*NL*
come
to
her
cheek
,
and
its
absolute
paleness
was
heightened
by
the
*NL*
jet
black
of
her
gown
,
till
it
appeared
preternatural
.
When
she
*NL*
reached
a
little
shop
at
the
other
end
of
the
place
,
which
stood
*NL*
nearly
opposite
to
the
churchyard
,
Bathsheba
heard
singing
inside
the
*NL*
church
,
and
she
knew
that
the
singers
were
practising
.
She
crossed
*NL*
the
road
,
opened
the
gate
,
and
entered
the
graveyard
,
the
high
sills
*NL*
of
the
church
windows
effectually
screening
her
from
the
eyes
of
*NL*
those
gathered
within
.
Her
stealthy
walk
was
to
the
nook
wherein
*NL*
Troy
had
worked
at
planting
flowers
upon
Fanny
Robin
's
grave
,
and
*NL*
she
came
to
the
marble
tombstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
motion
of
satisfaction
enlivened
her
face
as
she
read
the
complete
*NL*
inscription
.
First
came
the
words
of
Troy
himself
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
ERECTED
BY
FRANCIS
TROY
*NL*
IN
BELOVED
MEMORY
OF
*NL*
FANNY
ROBIN
,
*NL*
WHO
DIED
OCTOBER
9
,
18
--
,
*NL*
AGED
20
YEARS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Underneath
this
was
now
inscribed
in
new
letters
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IN
THE
SAME
GRAVE
LIE
*NL*
THE
REMAINS
OF
THE
AFORESAID
*NL*
FRANCIS
TROY
,
*NL*
WHO
DIED
DECEMBER
24TH
,
18
--
,
*NL*
AGED
26
YEARS
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Whilst
she
stood
and
read
and
meditated
the
tones
of
the
organ
*NL*
began
again
in
the
church
,
and
she
went
with
the
same
light
step
*NL*
round
to
the
porch
and
listened
.
The
door
was
closed
,
and
the
*NL*
choir
was
learning
a
new
hymn
.
Bathsheba
was
stirred
by
emotions
*NL*
which
latterly
she
had
assumed
to
be
altogether
dead
within
her
.
*NL*
The
little
attenuated
voices
of
the
children
brought
to
her
ear
*NL*
in
distinct
utterance
the
words
they
sang
without
thought
or
*NL*
comprehension
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Lead
,
kindly
Light
,
amid
the
encircling
gloom
,
*NL*
Lead
Thou
me
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
's
feeling
was
always
to
some
extent
dependent
upon
her
*NL*
whim
,
as
is
the
case
with
many
other
women
.
Something
big
came
into
*NL*
her
throat
and
an
uprising
to
her
eyes
--
and
she
thought
that
she
*NL*
would
allow
the
imminent
tears
to
flow
if
they
wished
.
They
did
*NL*
flow
and
plenteously
,
and
one
fell
upon
the
stone
bench
beside
her
.
*NL*
Once
that
she
had
begun
to
cry
for
she
hardly
knew
what
,
she
could
*NL*
not
leave
off
for
crowding
thoughts
she
knew
too
well
.
She
would
*NL*
have
given
anything
in
the
world
to
be
,
as
those
children
were
,
*NL*
unconcerned
at
the
meaning
of
their
words
,
because
too
innocent
to
*NL*
feel
the
necessity
for
any
such
expression
.
All
the
impassioned
*NL*
scenes
of
her
brief
experience
seemed
to
revive
with
added
emotion
at
*NL*
that
moment
,
and
those
scenes
which
had
been
without
emotion
during
*NL*
enactment
had
emotion
then
.
Yet
grief
came
to
her
rather
as
a
luxury
*NL*
than
as
the
scourge
of
former
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Owing
to
Bathsheba
's
face
being
buried
in
her
hands
she
did
not
*NL*
notice
a
form
which
came
quietly
into
the
porch
,
and
on
seeing
*NL*
her
,
first
moved
as
if
to
retreat
,
then
paused
and
regarded
her
.
*NL*
Bathsheba
did
not
raise
her
head
for
some
time
,
and
when
she
looked
*NL*
round
her
face
was
wet
,
and
her
eyes
drowned
and
dim
.
``
Mr.
Oak
,
''
*NL*
exclaimed
she
,
disconcerted
,
``
how
long
have
you
been
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
few
minutes
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Oak
,
respectfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
going
in
?
''
said
Bathsheba
;
and
there
came
from
within
the
*NL*
church
as
from
a
prompter
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
loved
the
garish
day
,
and
,
spite
of
fears
,
*NL*
Pride
ruled
my
will
:
remember
not
past
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
I
am
one
of
the
bass
singers
,
you
know
.
I
*NL*
have
sung
bass
for
several
months
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
:
I
was
n't
aware
of
that
.
I
'll
leave
you
,
then
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Which
I
have
loved
long
since
,
and
lost
awhile
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
sang
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
me
drive
you
away
,
mistress
.
I
think
I
wo
n't
go
in
*NL*
to-night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
--
you
do
n't
drive
me
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
they
stood
in
a
state
of
some
embarrassment
,
Bathsheba
trying
to
*NL*
wipe
her
dreadfully
drenched
and
inflamed
face
without
his
noticing
*NL*
her
.
At
length
Oak
said
,
``
I
've
not
seen
you
--
I
mean
spoken
to
*NL*
you
--
since
ever
so
long
,
have
I
?
''
But
he
feared
to
bring
distressing
*NL*
memories
back
,
and
interrupted
himself
with
:
``
Were
you
going
into
*NL*
church
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
she
said
.
``
I
came
to
see
the
tombstone
privately
--
to
see
if
*NL*
they
had
cut
the
inscription
as
I
wished
.
Mr.
Oak
,
you
need
n't
mind
*NL*
speaking
to
me
,
if
you
wish
to
,
on
the
matter
which
is
in
both
our
*NL*
minds
at
this
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
have
they
done
it
as
you
wished
?
''
said
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Come
and
see
it
,
if
you
have
not
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
together
they
went
and
read
the
tomb
.
``
Eight
months
ago
!
''
Gabriel
*NL*
murmured
when
he
saw
the
date
.
``
It
seems
like
yesterday
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
to
me
as
if
it
were
years
ago
--
long
years
,
and
I
had
been
dead
*NL*
between
.
And
now
I
am
going
home
,
Mr.
Oak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
walked
after
her
.
``
I
wanted
to
name
a
small
matter
to
you
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
could
,
''
he
said
,
with
hesitation
.
``
Merely
about
business
,
*NL*
and
I
think
I
may
just
mention
it
now
,
if
you
'll
allow
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
that
I
may
soon
have
to
give
up
the
management
of
your
farm
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Troy
.
The
fact
is
,
I
am
thinking
of
leaving
England
--
not
yet
,
*NL*
you
know
--
next
spring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leaving
England
!
''
she
said
,
in
surprise
and
genuine
disappointment
.
*NL*
``
Why
,
Gabriel
,
what
are
you
going
to
do
that
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
've
thought
it
best
,
''
Oak
stammered
out
.
``
California
is
the
*NL*
spot
I
've
had
in
my
mind
to
try
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
is
understood
everywhere
that
you
are
going
to
take
poor
Mr.
*NL*
Boldwood
's
farm
on
your
own
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
had
the
refusal
o
'
it
't
is
true
;
but
nothing
is
settled
yet
,
*NL*
and
I
have
reasons
for
giving
up
.
I
shall
finish
out
my
year
there
*NL*
as
manager
for
the
trustees
,
but
no
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
what
shall
I
do
without
you
?
Oh
,
Gabriel
,
I
do
n't
think
you
*NL*
ought
to
go
away
.
You
've
been
with
me
so
long
--
through
bright
times
*NL*
and
dark
times
--
such
old
friends
as
we
are
--
that
it
seems
unkind
*NL*
almost
.
I
had
fancied
that
if
you
leased
the
other
farm
as
master
,
*NL*
you
might
still
give
a
helping
look
across
at
mine
.
And
now
going
*NL*
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
have
willingly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yet
now
that
I
am
more
helpless
than
ever
you
go
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
that
's
the
ill
fortune
o
'
it
,
''
said
Gabriel
,
in
a
distressed
*NL*
tone
.
``
And
it
is
because
of
that
very
helplessness
that
I
feel
bound
*NL*
to
go
.
Good
afternoon
,
ma'am
''
he
concluded
,
in
evident
anxiety
to
*NL*
get
away
,
and
at
once
went
out
of
the
churchyard
by
a
path
she
could
*NL*
follow
on
no
pretence
whatever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
went
home
,
her
mind
occupied
with
a
new
trouble
,
which
*NL*
being
rather
harassing
than
deadly
was
calculated
to
do
good
by
*NL*
diverting
her
from
the
chronic
gloom
of
her
life
.
She
was
set
*NL*
thinking
a
great
deal
about
Oak
and
of
his
wish
to
shun
her
;
*NL*
and
there
occurred
to
Bathsheba
several
incidents
of
her
latter
*NL*
intercourse
with
him
,
which
,
trivial
when
singly
viewed
,
amounted
*NL*
together
to
a
perceptible
disinclination
for
her
society
.
It
broke
*NL*
upon
her
at
length
as
a
great
pain
that
her
last
old
disciple
was
*NL*
about
to
forsake
her
and
flee
.
He
who
had
believed
in
her
and
argued
*NL*
on
her
side
when
all
the
rest
of
the
world
was
against
her
,
had
at
*NL*
last
like
the
others
become
weary
and
neglectful
of
the
old
cause
,
*NL*
and
was
leaving
her
to
fight
her
battles
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
weeks
went
on
,
and
more
evidence
of
his
want
of
interest
in
*NL*
her
was
forthcoming
.
She
noticed
that
instead
of
entering
the
small
*NL*
parlour
or
office
where
the
farm
accounts
were
kept
,
and
waiting
,
or
*NL*
leaving
a
memorandum
as
he
had
hitherto
done
during
her
seclusion
,
*NL*
Oak
never
came
at
all
when
she
was
likely
to
be
there
,
only
entering
*NL*
at
unseasonable
hours
when
her
presence
in
that
part
of
the
house
*NL*
was
least
to
be
expected
.
Whenever
he
wanted
directions
he
sent
a
*NL*
message
,
or
note
with
neither
heading
nor
signature
,
to
which
she
was
*NL*
obliged
to
reply
in
the
same
offhand
style
.
Poor
Bathsheba
began
to
*NL*
suffer
now
from
the
most
torturing
sting
of
all
--
a
sensation
that
she
*NL*
was
despised
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
autumn
wore
away
gloomily
enough
amid
these
melancholy
*NL*
conjectures
,
and
Christmas-day
came
,
completing
a
year
of
her
legal
*NL*
widowhood
,
and
two
years
and
a
quarter
of
her
life
alone
.
On
*NL*
examining
her
heart
it
appeared
beyond
measure
strange
that
the
*NL*
subject
of
which
the
season
might
have
been
supposed
suggestive
--
the
*NL*
event
in
the
hall
at
Boldwood
's
--
was
not
agitating
her
at
all
;
but
*NL*
instead
,
an
agonizing
conviction
that
everybody
abjured
her
--
for
what
*NL*
she
could
not
tell
--
and
that
Oak
was
the
ringleader
of
the
recusants
.
*NL*
Coming
out
of
church
that
day
she
looked
round
in
hope
that
Oak
,
*NL*
whose
bass
voice
she
had
heard
rolling
out
from
the
gallery
overhead
*NL*
in
a
most
unconcerned
manner
,
might
chance
to
linger
in
her
path
in
*NL*
the
old
way
.
There
he
was
,
as
usual
,
coming
down
the
path
behind
*NL*
her
.
But
on
seeing
Bathsheba
turn
,
he
looked
aside
,
and
as
soon
*NL*
as
he
got
beyond
the
gate
,
and
there
was
the
barest
excuse
for
a
*NL*
divergence
,
he
made
one
,
and
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
brought
the
culminating
stroke
;
she
had
been
*NL*
expecting
it
long
.
It
was
a
formal
notice
by
letter
from
him
that
he
*NL*
should
not
renew
his
engagement
with
her
for
the
following
Lady-day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
actually
sat
and
cried
over
this
letter
most
bitterly
.
She
*NL*
was
aggrieved
and
wounded
that
the
possession
of
hopeless
love
from
*NL*
Gabriel
,
which
she
had
grown
to
regard
as
her
inalienable
right
for
*NL*
life
,
should
have
been
withdrawn
just
at
his
own
pleasure
in
this
*NL*
way
.
She
was
bewildered
too
by
the
prospect
of
having
to
rely
on
her
*NL*
own
resources
again
:
it
seemed
to
herself
that
she
never
could
again
*NL*
acquire
energy
sufficient
to
go
to
market
,
barter
,
and
sell
.
*NL*
Since
Troy
's
death
Oak
had
attended
all
sales
and
fairs
for
her
,
*NL*
transacting
her
business
at
the
same
time
with
his
own
.
What
should
*NL*
she
do
now
?
Her
life
was
becoming
a
desolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
desolate
was
Bathsheba
this
evening
,
that
in
an
absolute
hunger
*NL*
for
pity
and
sympathy
,
and
miserable
in
that
she
appeared
to
have
*NL*
outlived
the
only
true
friendship
she
had
ever
owned
,
she
put
on
her
*NL*
bonnet
and
cloak
and
went
down
to
Oak
's
house
just
after
sunset
,
*NL*
guided
on
her
way
by
the
pale
primrose
rays
of
a
crescent
moon
a
few
*NL*
days
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lively
firelight
shone
from
the
window
,
but
nobody
was
visible
in
*NL*
the
room
.
She
tapped
nervously
,
and
then
thought
it
doubtful
if
*NL*
it
were
right
for
a
single
woman
to
call
upon
a
bachelor
who
lived
*NL*
alone
,
although
he
was
her
manager
,
and
she
might
be
supposed
to
call
*NL*
on
business
without
any
real
impropriety
.
Gabriel
opened
the
door
,
*NL*
and
the
moon
shone
upon
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Oak
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
faintly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
am
Mr.
Oak
,
''
said
Gabriel
.
``
Who
have
I
the
honour
--
O
how
*NL*
stupid
of
me
,
not
to
know
you
,
mistress
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
be
your
mistress
much
longer
,
shall
I
Gabriel
?
''
she
*NL*
said
,
in
pathetic
tones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
no
.
I
suppose
--
But
come
in
,
ma'am
.
Oh
--
and
I
'll
get
a
*NL*
light
,
''
Oak
replied
,
with
some
awkwardness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
on
my
account
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
so
seldom
that
I
get
a
lady
visitor
that
I
'm
afraid
I
have
n't
*NL*
proper
accommodation
.
Will
you
sit
down
,
please
?
Here
's
a
chair
,
and
*NL*
there
's
one
,
too
.
I
am
sorry
that
my
chairs
all
have
wood
seats
,
and
*NL*
are
rather
hard
,
but
I
--
was
thinking
of
getting
some
new
ones

''
Oak
*NL*
placed
two
or
three
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
are
quite
easy
enough
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
down
she
sat
,
and
down
sat
he
,
the
fire
dancing
in
their
faces
,
*NL*
and
upon
the
old
furniture
,

*NL*
that
formed
Oak
's
array
of
household
possessions
,
which
sent
back
a
*NL*
dancing
reflection
in
reply
.
It
was
very
odd
to
these
two
persons
,
*NL*
who
knew
each
other
passing
well
,
that
the
mere
circumstance
of
their
*NL*
meeting
in
a
new
place
and
in
a
new
way
should
make
them
so
awkward
*NL*
and
constrained
.
In
the
fields
,
or
at
her
house
,
there
had
never
*NL*
been
any
embarrassment
;
but
now
that
Oak
had
become
the
entertainer
*NL*
their
lives
seemed
to
be
moved
back
again
to
the
days
when
they
were
*NL*
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'll
think
it

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I

been
uneasy
in

that

It

grieved
me
very

Bathsheba
did
not
look
quite
so
alarmed
as
if
a
cannon
had
been

discharged
by
her
ear

was
what

had
expected

Gabriel
looked
her
long
in
the
face

the
firelight
being
faint
*NL*
there
was
not
much
to
be
seen

he
said

tenderly
and
in

surprise

coming
closer
:
``
if

whether
you

allow

joyousness

thankfully

from

I

be
missed

Why
Gabriel

she
said
,
with
a
slight
laugh

as

they
went
to
the
door

*NL*
*NL*
``
And
quite
right
too

said
Oak

``
I

danced
at
your
skittish

heels

my
beautiful
Bathsheba

for
many
a
long
mile

and
many
a
long
*NL*
day
;
and
it
is
hard
to
begrudge
me
this
one
visit

*NL*
*NL*
He
accompanied
her
up
the
hill
,
explaining
to
her
the
details
of
*NL*
his
forthcoming
tenure
of
the
other
farm
.
They
spoke
very
little
*NL*
of
their
mutual
feeling
;
pretty
phrases
and
warm
expressions
being
*NL*
probably
unnecessary
between
such
tried
friends
.
Theirs
was
that
*NL*
substantial
affection
which
arises
-LRB-
if
any
arises
at
all
-RRB-
when
the
*NL*
two
who
are
thrown
together
begin
first
by
knowing
the
rougher
*NL*
sides
of
each
other
's
character
,
and
not
the
best
till
further
on
,
*NL*
the
romance
growing
up
in
the
interstices
of
a
mass
of
hard
prosaic
*NL*
reality
.
This
good-fellowship
--
_
camaraderie
_
--
usually
occurring
*NL*
through
similarity
of
pursuits
,
is
unfortunately
seldom
superadded
*NL*
to
love
between
the
sexes
,
because
men
and
women
associate
,
not
in
*NL*
their
labours
,
but
in
their
pleasures
merely
.
Where
,
however
,
happy
*NL*
circumstance
permits
its
development
,
the
compounded
feeling
proves
*NL*
itself
to
be
the
only
love
which
is
strong
as
death
--
that
love
which
*NL*
many
waters
can
not
quench
,
nor
the
floods
drown
,
beside
which
the
*NL*
passion
usually
called
by
the
name
is
evanescent
as
steam

Those
had
been
Bathsheba
's
words
to
Oak
one
evening
,
some
time
after
*NL*
the
event
of
the
preceding
f
,
and
he
meditated
a
full
hour
by
*NL*
the
clock
upon
how
to
carry
out
her
wishes
to
the
letter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
license

O
yes

it
must

license

to
himself
at
last

``
Very

On
a
dark
night
,
a
few
days
later
,
Oak
came
with
mysterious
steps
*NL*
from
the
surrogate
's
door
,
in
Casterbridge
.
On
the
way
home
he
heard
*NL*
a
heavy
tread
in
front
of
him
,
and
,
overtaking
the
man
,
found
him
to
*NL*
be
Coggan
.
They
walked
together
into
the
village
until
they
came
to
*NL*
a
little
lane
behind
the
church
,
leading
down
to
the
cottage
of
Laban
*NL*
Tall
,
who
had
lately
been
installed
as
clerk
of
the
parish
,
and
was
*NL*
yet
in
mortal
terror
at
church
on
Sundays
when
he
heard
his
lone
*NL*
voice
among
certain
hard
words
of
the
Psalms
,
whither
no
man
ventured
*NL*
to
follow
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
good-night
,
Coggan
,
''
said
Oak
,
``
I
'm
going
down
this
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Coggan
,
surprised
;
``
what
's
going
on
to-night
then
,
make
so
*NL*
bold
Mr.
Oak
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
rather
ungenerous
not
to
tell
Coggan
,
under
the
*NL*
circumstances
,
for
Coggan
had
been
true
as
steel
all
through
the
time
*NL*
of
Gabriel
's
unhappiness
about
Bathsheba
,
and
Gabriel
said
,
``
You
can
*NL*
keep
a
secret
,
Coggan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
proved
me
,
and
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
have
,
and
I
do
know
.
Well
,
then
,
mistress
and
I
mean
to
get
*NL*
married
to-morrow
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heaven
's
high
tower
!
And
yet
I
've
thought
of
such
a
thing
from
time
*NL*
to
time
;
true
,
I
have
.
But
keeping
it
so
close
!
Well
,
there
,
't
is
*NL*
no
consarn
of
of
mine
,
and
I
wish
`
ee
joy
o
'
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
Coggan
.
But
I
assure
`
ee
that
this
great
hush
is
not
*NL*
what
I
wished
for
at
all
,
or
what
either
of
us
would
have
wished
if
*NL*
it
had
n't
been
for
certain
things
that
would
make
a
gay
wedding
seem
*NL*
hardly
the
thing
.
Bathsheba
has
a
great
wish
that
all
the
parish
*NL*
shall
not
be
in
church
,
looking
at
her
--
she
's
shy-like
and
nervous
*NL*
about
it
,
in
fact
--
so
I
be
doing
this
to
humour
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
I
see
:
quite
right
,
too
,
I
suppose
I
must
say
.
And
you
be
now
*NL*
going
down
to
the
clerk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
you
may
as
well
come
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afeard
your
labour
in
keeping
it
close
will
be
throwed
away
,
''
*NL*
said
Coggan
,
as
they
walked
along
.
``
Labe
Tall
's
old
woman
will
horn
*NL*
it
all
over
parish
in
half-an-hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
she
will
,
upon
my
life
;
I
never
thought
of
that
,
''
said
Oak
,
*NL*
pausing
.
``
Yet
I
must
tell
him
to-night
,
I
suppose
,
for
he
's
working
*NL*
so
far
off
,
and
leaves
early
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
`
ee
how
we
could
tackle
her
,
''
said
Coggan
.
``
I
'll
knock
*NL*
and
ask
to
speak
to
Laban
outside
the
door
,
you
standing
in
the
*NL*
background
.
Then
he
'll
come
out
,
and
you
can
tell
yer
tale
.
She
'll
*NL*
never
guess
what
I
want
en
for
;
and
I
'll
make
up
a
few
words
about
*NL*
the
farm-work
,
as
a
blind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
scheme
was
considered
feasible
;
and
Coggan
advanced
boldly
,
and
*NL*
rapped
at
Mrs.
Tall
's
door
.
Mrs.
Tall
herself
opened
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wanted
to
have
a
word
with
Laban
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
not
at
home
,
and
wo
n't
be
this
side
of
eleven
o'clock
.
He
've
*NL*
been
forced
to
go
over
to
Yalbury
since
shutting
out
work
.
I
shall
*NL*
do
quite
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hardly
think
you
will
.
Stop
a
moment
;
''
and
Coggan
stepped
round
*NL*
the
corner
of
the
porch
to
consult
Oak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
's
t
`
other
man
,
then
?
''
said
Mrs.
Tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
a
friend
,
''
said
Coggan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
he
's
wanted
to
meet
mistress
near
church-hatch
to-morrow
morning
*NL*
at
ten
,
''
said
Oak
,
in
a
whisper
.
``
That
he
must
come
without
fail
,
*NL*
and
wear
his
best
clothes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
clothes
will
floor
us
as
safe
as
houses
!
''
said
Coggan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
ca
n't
be
helped
,
''
said
Oak
.
``
Tell
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
Coggan
delivered
the
message
.
``
Mind
,
het
or
wet
,
blow
or
snow
,
*NL*
he
must
come
,
''
added
Jan.
.
''
'T
is
very
particular
,
indeed
.
The
fact
*NL*
is
,
't
is
to
witness
her
sign
some
law-work
about
taking
shares
wi
'
*NL*
another
farmer
for
a
long
span
o
'
years
.
There
,
that
's
what
't
is
,
*NL*
and
now
I
've
told
`
ee
,
Mother
Tall
,
in
a
way
I
should
n't
ha
'
done
*NL*
if
I
had
n't
loved
`
ee
so
hopeless
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Coggan
retired
before
she
could
ask
any
further
;
and
next
they
called
*NL*
at
the
vicar
's
in
a
manner
which
excited
no
curiosity
at
all
.
Then
*NL*
Gabriel
went
home
,
and
prepared
for
the
morrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
Liddy
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
on
going
to
bed
that
night
,
``
I
want
you
to
*NL*
call
me
at
seven
o'clock
to-morrow
,
In
case
I
should
n't
wake
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
always
do
wake
afore
then
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
but
I
have
something
important
to
do
,
which
I
'll
tell
you
of
*NL*
when
the
time
comes
,
and
it
's
best
to
make
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
,
however
,
awoke
voluntarily
at
four
,
nor
could
she
by
any
*NL*
contrivance
get
to
sleep
again
.
About
six
,
being
quite
positive
that
*NL*
her
watch
had
stopped
during
the
night
,
she
could
wait
no
longer
.
*NL*
She
went
and
tapped
at
Liddy
's
door
,
and
after
some
labour
awoke
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
thought
it
was
I
who
had
to
call
you
?
''
said
the
bewildered
*NL*
Liddy
.
``
And
it
is
n't
six
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
it
is
;
how
can
you
tell
such
a
story
,
Liddy
?
I
know
it
must
*NL*
be
ever
so
much
past
seven
.
Come
to
my
room
as
soon
as
you
can
;
I
*NL*
want
you
to
give
my
hair
a
good
brushing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Liddy
came
to
Bathsheba
's
room
her
mistress
was
already
waiting
.
*NL*
Liddy
could
not
understand
this
extraordinary
promptness
.
``
Whatever
*NL*
IS
going
on
,
ma'am
?
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'll
tell
you
,
''
said
Bathsheba
,
with
a
mischievous
smile
in
*NL*
her
bright
eyes
.
``
Farmer
Oak
is
coming
here
to
dine
with
me
to-day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farmer
Oak
--
and
nobody
else
?
--
you
two
alone
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
safe
,
ma'am
,
after
what
's
been
said
?
''
asked
her
companion
,
*NL*
dubiously
.
``
A
woman
's
good
name
is
such
a
perishable
article
that
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bathsheba
laughed
with
a
flushed
cheek
,
and
whispered
in
Liddy
's
ear
,
*NL*
although
there
was
nobody
present
.
Then
Liddy
stared
and
exclaimed
,
*NL*
``
Souls
alive
,
what
news
!
It
makes
my
heart
go
quite
bumpity-bump
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
makes
mine
rather
furious
,
too
,
''
said
Bathsheba
.
``
However
,
*NL*
there
's
no
getting
out
of
it
now
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
damp
disagreeable
morning
.
Nevertheless
,
at
twenty
minutes
*NL*
to
ten
o'clock
,
Oak
came
out
of
his
house
,
and
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Went
up
the
hill
side
*NL*
With
that
sort
of
stride
*NL*
A
man
puts
out
when
walking
in
search
of
a
bride
,
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
and
knocked
Bathsheba
's
door
.
Ten
minutes
later
a
large
and
a
*NL*
smaller
umbrella
might
have
been
seen
moving
from
the
same
door
,
and
*NL*
through
the
mist
along
the
road
to
the
church
.
The
distance
was
not
*NL*
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
and
these
two
sensible
persons
deemed
*NL*
it
unnecessary
to
drive
.
An
observer
must
have
been
very
close
*NL*
indeed
to
discover
that
the
forms
under
the
umbrellas
were
those
of
*NL*
Oak
and
Bathsheba
,
arm-in-arm
for
the
first
time
in
their
lives
,
Oak
*NL*
in
a
greatcoat
extending
to
his
knees
,
and
Bathsheba
in
a
cloak
that
*NL*
reached
her
clogs
.
Yet
,
though
so
plainly
dressed
,
there
was
a
*NL*
certain
rejuvenated
appearance
about
her
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
As
though
a
rose
should
shut
and
be
a
bud
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Repose
had
again
incarnadined
her
cheeks
;
and
having
,
at
Gabriel
's
*NL*
request
,
arranged
her
hair
this
morning
as
she
had
worn
it
years
ago
*NL*
on
Norcombe
Hill
,
she
seemed
in
his
eyes
remarkably
like
a
girl
of
*NL*
that
fascinating
dream
,
which
,
considering
that
she
was
now
only
*NL*
three
or
four-and-twenty
,
was
perhaps
not
very
wonderful
.
In
the
*NL*
church
were
Tall
,
Liddy
,
and
the
parson
,
and
in
a
remarkably
short
*NL*
space
of
time
the
deed
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sat
down
very
quietly
to
tea
in
Bathsheba
's
parlour
in
the
*NL*
evening
of
the
same
day
,
for
it
had
been
arranged
that
Farmer
Oak
*NL*
should
go
there
to
live
,
since
he
had
as
yet
neither
money
,
house
,
*NL*
nor
furniture
worthy
of
the
name
,
though
he
was
on
a
sure
way
towards
*NL*
them
,
whilst
Bathsheba
was
,
comparatively
,
in
a
plethora
of
all
*NL*
three
.
*NL*
*NL*
Just
as
Bathsheba
was
pouring
out
a
cup
of
tea
,
their
ears
were
*NL*
greeted
by
the
firing
of
a
cannon
,
followed
by
what
seemed
like
a
*NL*
tremendous
blowing
of
trumpets
,
in
the
front
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
!
''
said
Oak
,
laughing
,
``
I
knew
those
fellows
were
up
to
*NL*
something
,
by
the
look
on
their
faces
''
*NL*
*NL*
Oak
took
up
the
light
and
went
into
the
porch
,
followed
by
Bathsheba
*NL*
with
a
shawl
over
her
head
.
The
rays
fell
upon
a
group
of
male
*NL*
figures
gathered
upon
the
gravel
in
front
,
who
,
when
they
saw
the
*NL*
newly-married
couple
in
the
porch
,
set
up
a
loud
``
Hurrah
!
''
and
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
bang
again
went
the
cannon
in
the
background
,
followed
by
*NL*
a
hideous
clang
of
music
from
a
drum
,
tambourine
,
clarionet
,
serpent
,
*NL*
hautboy
,
tenor-viol
,
and
double-bass
--
the
only
remaining
relics
*NL*
of
the
true
and
original
Weatherbury
band
--
venerable
worm-eaten
*NL*
instruments
,
which
had
celebrated
in
their
own
persons
the
victories
*NL*
of
Marlborough
,
under
the
fingers
of
the
forefathers
of
those
who
*NL*
played
them
now
.
The
performers
came
forward
,
and
marched
up
to
the
*NL*
front
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
bright
boys
,
Mark
Clark
and
Jan
,
are
at
the
bottom
of
all
*NL*
this
,
''
said
Oak
.
``
Come
in
,
souls
,
and
have
something
to
eat
and
*NL*
drink
wi
'
me
and
my
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
to-night
,
''
said
Mr.
Clark
,
with
evident
self-denial
.
``
Thank
*NL*
ye
all
the
same
;
but
we
'll
call
at
a
more
seemly
time
.
However
,
we
*NL*
could
n't
think
of
letting
the
day
pass
without
a
note
of
admiration
*NL*
of
some
sort
.
If
ye
could
send
a
drop
of
som
`
at
down
to
Warren
's
,
*NL*
why
so
it
is
.
Here
's
long
life
and
happiness

Oak
and
*NL*
his
comely
bride
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
ye

thank
ye
all

said
Gabriel
.
``
A
bit
and
a
drop
shall
be
*NL*
sent
to
Warren
's
for
ye
at
once

I
had
a
thought
that
we
might
very
*NL*
likely
get
a
salute
of
some
sort
from
our
old
friends
,
and
I
was
*NL*
saying
so
to
my
wife
but
now

*NL*
*NL*
``
Faith

''
said
Coggan
,
in
a
critical
tone
,
turning
to
his
companions
,
*NL*
``
the
man
hev
learnt
to
say
`
my
wife

in
a
wonderful

youthful

is
in

as
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``

never
heerd

skilful
old
married
feller

years

*NL*
standing
pipe

my

in
a
more
used
note
than

said
Jacob
*NL*
Smallbury
.
``
It
might
have
been
a
little
more
true
to

chillier
,
but
that
was
n't
to
be
expected
just
*NL*
now

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
improvement
will
come
wi

time

said
Jan
,
twirling
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Oak
laughed
,
and
Bathsheba
smiled
-LRB-
for
she
never
laughed
readily
*NL*
now
-RRB-
,
and
their
friends
turned
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
suppose
that
's
the
size
o

said
Joseph
Poorgrass
with
a
*NL*
cheerful
sigh
as
they
moved
away
;
``
and
I
wish
him
joy
