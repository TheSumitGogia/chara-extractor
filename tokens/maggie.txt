MAGGIE

A
GIRL
OF
THE
STREETS

CRANE

*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
I
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
little
boy
stood
upon
a
heap
of
gravel
for
the
honor
of
Rum
*NL*
Alley
.
He
was
throwing
stones
at
howling
urchins
from
Devil
's
Row
who
*NL*
were
circling
madly
about
the
heap
and
pelting
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
infantile
countenance
was
livid
with
fury
.
His
small
body
was
*NL*
writhing
in
the
delivery
of
great
,
crimson
oaths
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Run
,
Jimmie
,
run
!
Dey
'll
get
yehs
,
''
screamed
a
retreating
Rum
Alley
*NL*
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naw
,
''
responded
Jimmie
with
a
valiant
roar
,
``
dese
micks
ca
n't
make
me
*NL*
run
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Howls
of
renewed
wrath
went
up
from
Devil
's
Row
throats
.
Tattered
*NL*
gamins
on
the
right
made
a
furious
assault
on
the
gravel
heap
.
On
*NL*
their
small
,
convulsed
faces
there
shone
the
grins
of
true
assassins
.
*NL*
As
they
charged
,
they
threw
stones
and
cursed
in
shrill
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
champion
of
Rum
Alley
stumbled
precipitately
down
the
other
*NL*
side
.
His
coat
had
been
torn
to
shreds
in
a
scuffle
,
and
his
hat
was
*NL*
gone
.
He
had
bruises
on
twenty
parts
of
his
body
,
and
blood
was
*NL*
dripping
from
a
cut
in
his
head
.
His
wan
features
wore
a
look
of
a
*NL*
tiny
,
insane
demon
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
ground
,
children
from
Devil
's
Row
closed
in
on
their
antagonist
.
*NL*
He
crooked
his
left
arm
defensively
about
his
head
and
fought
with
*NL*
cursing
fury
.
The
little
boys
ran
to
and
fro
,
dodging
,
hurling
stones
*NL*
and
swearing
in
barbaric
trebles
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
a
window
of
an
apartment
house
that
upreared
its
form
from
amid
*NL*
squat
,
ignorant
stables
,
there
leaned
a
curious
woman
.
Some
laborers
,
*NL*
unloading
a
scow
at
a
dock
at
the
river
,
paused
for
a
moment
and
*NL*
regarded
the
fight
.
The
engineer
of
a
passive
tugboat
hung
lazily
to
a
*NL*
railing
and
watched
.
Over
on
the
Island
,
a
worm
of
yellow
convicts
*NL*
came
from
the
shadow
of
a
building
and
crawled
slowly
along
the
river
's
*NL*
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stone
had
smashed
into
Jimmie
's
mouth
.
Blood
was
bubbling
over
his
*NL*
chin
and
down
upon
his
ragged
shirt
.
Tears
made
furrows
on
his
*NL*
dirt-stained
cheeks
.
His
thin
legs
had
begun
to
tremble
and
turn
weak
,
*NL*
causing
his
small
body
to
reel
.
His
roaring
curses
of
the
first
part
*NL*
of
the
fight
had
changed
to
a
blasphemous
chatter
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
yells
of
the
whirling
mob
of
Devil
's
Row
children
there
were
*NL*
notes
of
joy
like
songs
of
triumphant
savagery
.
The
little
boys
seemed
*NL*
to
leer
gloatingly
at
the
blood
upon
the
other
child
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
the
avenue
came
boastfully
sauntering
a
lad
of
sixteen
years
,
*NL*
although
the
chronic
sneer
of
an
ideal
manhood
already
sat
upon
his
*NL*
lips
.
His
hat
was
tipped
with
an
air
of
challenge
over
his
eye
.
*NL*
Between
his
teeth
,
a
cigar
stump
was
tilted
at
the
angle
of
defiance
.
*NL*
He
walked
with
a
certain
swing
of
the
shoulders
which
appalled
the
*NL*
timid
.
He
glanced
over
into
the
vacant
lot
in
which
the
little
raving
*NL*
boys
from
Devil
's
Row
seethed
about
the
shrieking
and
tearful
child
*NL*
from
Rum
Alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
!
''
he
murmured
with
interest
.
``
A
scrap
.
Gee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
strode
over
to
the
cursing
circle
,
swinging
his
shoulders
in
a
*NL*
manner
which
denoted
that
he
held
victory
in
his
fists
.
He
approached
*NL*
at
the
back
of
one
of
the
most
deeply
engaged
of
the
Devil
's
Row
*NL*
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
,
''
he
said
,
and
smote
the
deeply-engaged
one
on
the
*NL*
back
of
the
head
.
The
little
boy
fell
to
the
ground
and
gave
a
hoarse
,
*NL*
tremendous
howl
.
He
scrambled
to
his
feet
,
and
perceiving
,
evidently
,
*NL*
the
size
of
his
assailant
,
ran
quickly
off
,
shouting
alarms
.
The
*NL*
entire
Devil
's
Row
party
followed
him
.
They
came
to
a
stand
a
short
*NL*
distance
away
and
yelled
taunting
oaths
at
the
boy
with
the
chronic
*NL*
sneer
.
The
latter
,
momentarily
,
paid
no
attention
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
,
Jimmie
?
''
he
asked
of
the
small
champion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
wiped
his
blood-wet
features
with
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
was
dis
way
,
Pete
,
see
!
I
was
goin
'
teh
lick
dat
Riley
kid
*NL*
and
dey
all
pitched
on
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
Rum
Alley
children
now
came
forward
.
The
party
stood
for
a
moment
*NL*
exchanging
vainglorious
remarks
with
Devil
's
Row
.
A
few
stones
were
*NL*
thrown
at
long
distances
,
and
words
of
challenge
passed
between
small
*NL*
warriors
.
Then
the
Rum
Alley
contingent
turned
slowly
in
the
direction
*NL*
of
their
home
street
.
They
began
to
give
,
each
to
each
,
distorted
*NL*
versions
of
the
fight
.
Causes
of
retreat
in
particular
cases
were
*NL*
magnified
.
Blows
dealt
in
the
fight
were
enlarged
to
catapultian
*NL*
power
,
and
stones
thrown
were
alleged
to
have
hurtled
with
infinite
*NL*
accuracy
.
Valor
grew
strong
again
,
and
the
little
boys
began
to
swear
*NL*
with
great
spirit
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
we
blokies
kin
lick
deh
hull
damn
Row
,
''
said
a
child
,
swaggering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Little
Jimmie
was
striving
to
stanch
the
flow
of
blood
from
his
cut
*NL*
lips
.
Scowling
,
he
turned
upon
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
where
deh
hell
was
yeh
when
I
was
doin
'
all
deh
fightin
?
''
he
*NL*
demanded
.
``
Youse
kids
makes
me
tired
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
go
ahn
,
''
replied
the
other
argumentatively
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
replied
with
heavy
contempt
.
``
Ah
,
youse
ca
n't
fight
,
Blue
*NL*
Billie
!
I
kin
lick
yeh
wid
one
han
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
go
ahn
,
''
replied
Billie
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
Jimmie
threateningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
''
said
the
other
in
the
same
tone
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
struck
at
each
other
,
clinched
,
and
rolled
over
on
the
cobble
*NL*
stones
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Smash
`
im
,
Jimmie
,
kick
deh
damn
guts
out
of
`
im
,
''
yelled
Pete
,
the
*NL*
lad
with
the
chronic
sneer
,
in
tones
of
delight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
combatants
pounded
and
kicked
,
scratched
and
tore
.
They
*NL*
began
to
weep
and
their
curses
struggled
in
their
throats
with
sobs
.
*NL*
The
other
little
boys
clasped
their
hands
and
wriggled
their
legs
in
*NL*
excitement
.
They
formed
a
bobbing
circle
about
the
pair
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tiny
spectator
was
suddenly
agitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cheese
it
,
Jimmie
,
cheese
it
!
Here
comes
yer
fader
,
''
he
yelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
circle
of
little
boys
instantly
parted
.
They
drew
away
and
waited
*NL*
in
ecstatic
awe
for
that
which
was
about
to
happen
.
The
two
little
*NL*
boys
fighting
in
the
modes
of
four
thousand
years
ago
,
did
not
hear
the
*NL*
warning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Up
the
avenue
there
plodded
slowly
a
man
with
sullen
eyes
.
He
was
*NL*
carrying
a
dinner
pail
and
smoking
an
apple-wood
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
neared
the
spot
where
the
little
boys
strove
,
he
regarded
them
*NL*
listlessly
.
But
suddenly
he
roared
an
oath
and
advanced
upon
the
*NL*
rolling
fighters
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
you
Jim
,
git
up
,
now
,
while
I
belt
yer
life
out
,
you
damned
*NL*
disorderly
brat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
began
to
kick
into
the
chaotic
mass
on
the
ground
.
The
boy
Billie
*NL*
felt
a
heavy
boot
strike
his
head
.
He
made
a
furious
effort
and
*NL*
disentangled
himself
from
Jimmie
.
He
tottered
away
,
damning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
arose
painfully
from
the
ground
and
confronting
his
father
,
*NL*
began
to
curse
him
.
His
parent
kicked
him
.
``
Come
home
,
now
,
''
he
*NL*
cried
,
``
an
'
stop
yer
jawin
'
,
er
I
'll
lam
the
everlasting
head
off
yehs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
departed
.
The
man
paced
placidly
along
with
the
apple-wood
emblem
*NL*
of
serenity
between
his
teeth
.
The
boy
followed
a
dozen
feet
in
the
*NL*
rear
.
He
swore
luridly
,
for
he
felt
that
it
was
degradation
for
one
*NL*
who
aimed
to
be
some
vague
soldier
,
or
a
man
of
blood
with
a
sort
of
*NL*
sublime
license
,
to
be
taken
home
by
a
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
II
*NL*
*NL*
Eventually
they
entered
into
a
dark
region
where
,
from
a
careening
*NL*
building
,
a
dozen
gruesome
doorways
gave
up
loads
of
babies
to
the
*NL*
street
and
the
gutter
.
A
wind
of
early
autumn
raised
yellow
dust
from
*NL*
cobbles
and
swirled
it
against
an
hundred
windows
.
Long
streamers
of
*NL*
garments
fluttered
from
fire-escapes
.
In
all
unhandy
places
there
were
*NL*
buckets
,
brooms
,
rags
and
bottles
.
In
the
street
infants
played
or
*NL*
fought
with
other
infants
or
sat
stupidly
in
the
way
of
vehicles
.
*NL*
Formidable
women
,
with
uncombed
hair
and
disordered
dress
,
gossiped
*NL*
while
leaning
on
railings
,
or
screamed
in
frantic
quarrels
.
Withered
*NL*
persons
,
in
curious
postures
of
submission
to
something
,
sat
smoking
*NL*
pipes
in
obscure
corners
.
A
thousand
odors
of
cooking
food
came
forth
*NL*
to
the
street
.
The
building
quivered
and
creaked
from
the
weight
of
*NL*
humanity
stamping
about
in
its
bowels
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
ragged
girl
dragged
a
red
,
bawling
infant
along
the
crowded
*NL*
ways
.
He
was
hanging
back
,
baby-like
,
bracing
his
wrinkled
,
bare
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
cried
out
:
``
Ah
,
Tommie
,
come
ahn
.
Dere
's
Jimmie
and
*NL*
fader
.
Do
n't
be
a-pullin
'
me
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
jerked
the
baby
's
arm
impatiently
.
He
fell
on
his
face
,
roaring
.
*NL*
With
a
second
jerk
she
pulled
him
to
his
feet
,
and
they
went
on
.
With
*NL*
the
obstinacy
of
his
order
,
he
protested
against
being
dragged
in
a
*NL*
chosen
direction
.
He
made
heroic
endeavors
to
keep
on
his
legs
,
*NL*
denounce
his
sister
and
consume
a
bit
of
orange
peeling
which
he
chewed
*NL*
between
the
times
of
his
infantile
orations
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
sullen-eyed
man
,
followed
by
the
blood-covered
boy
,
drew
near
,
*NL*
the
little
girl
burst
into
reproachful
cries
.
``
Ah
,
Jimmie
,
youse
bin
*NL*
fightin
'
agin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
urchin
swelled
disdainfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
,
Mag
.
See
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
upbraided
him
,
``
Youse
allus
fightin
'
,
Jimmie
,
an
'
yeh
*NL*
knows
it
puts
mudder
out
when
yehs
come
home
half
dead
,
an
'
it
's
like
*NL*
we
'll
all
get
a
poundin
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
weep
.
The
babe
threw
back
his
head
and
roared
at
his
*NL*
prospects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
!
''
cried
Jimmie
.
``
Shut
up
er
I
'll
smack
yer
mout
'
.
*NL*
See
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
his
sister
continued
her
lamentations
,
he
suddenly
swore
and
struck
*NL*
her
.
The
little
girl
reeled
and
,
recovering
herself
,
burst
into
tears
*NL*
and
quaveringly
cursed
him
.
As
she
slowly
retreated
her
brother
*NL*
advanced
dealing
her
cuffs
.
The
father
heard
and
turned
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
that
,
Jim
,
d'yeh
hear
?
Leave
yer
sister
alone
on
the
street
.
*NL*
It
's
like
I
can
never
beat
any
sense
into
yer
damned
wooden
head
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
urchin
raised
his
voice
in
defiance
to
his
parent
and
continued
his
*NL*
attacks
.
The
babe
bawled
tremendously
,
protesting
with
great
violence
.
*NL*
During
his
sister
's
hasty
manoeuvres
,
he
was
dragged
by
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
the
procession
plunged
into
one
of
the
gruesome
doorways
.
They
*NL*
crawled
up
dark
stairways
and
along
cold
,
gloomy
halls
.
At
last
the
*NL*
father
pushed
open
a
door
and
they
entered
a
lighted
room
in
which
a
*NL*
large
woman
was
rampant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
in
a
career
from
a
seething
stove
to
a
pan-covered
table
.
*NL*
As
the
father
and
children
filed
in
she
peered
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
what
?
Been
fightin
'
agin
,
by
Gawd
!
''
She
threw
herself
upon
*NL*
Jimmie
.
The
urchin
tried
to
dart
behind
the
others
and
in
the
scuffle
*NL*
the
babe
,
Tommie
,
was
knocked
down
.
He
protested
with
his
usual
*NL*
vehemence
,
because
they
had
bruised
his
tender
shins
against
a
table
*NL*
leg
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
's
massive
shoulders
heaved
with
anger
.
Grasping
the
urchin
*NL*
by
the
neck
and
shoulder
she
shook
him
until
he
rattled
.
She
dragged
*NL*
him
to
an
unholy
sink
,
and
,
soaking
a
rag
in
water
,
began
to
scrub
his
*NL*
lacerated
face
with
it
.
Jimmie
screamed
in
pain
and
tried
to
twist
his
*NL*
shoulders
out
of
the
clasp
of
the
huge
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
babe
sat
on
the
floor
watching
the
scene
,
his
face
in
contortions
*NL*
like
that
of
a
woman
at
a
tragedy
.
The
father
,
with
a
newly-ladened
*NL*
pipe
in
his
mouth
,
crouched
on
a
backless
chair
near
the
stove
.
*NL*
Jimmie
's
cries
annoyed
him
.
He
turned
about
and
bellowed
at
his
wife
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
the
damned
kid
alone
for
a
minute
,
will
yeh
,
Mary
?
Yer
allus
*NL*

Let

Do
n't
be
allus
poundin
'
a

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
's
operations
on
the
urchin
instantly
increased
in
violence
.
*NL*
At
last
she
tossed
him
to
a
corner
where
he
limply
lay
cursing
and
*NL*
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wife
put
her
immense
hands
on
her
hips
and
with
a
chieftain-like
*NL*
stride
approached
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ho
,
''
she
said
,
with
a
great
grunt
of
contempt
.
``
An
'
what
in
the
devil
*NL*
are
you
stickin
'
your
nose
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
babe
crawled
under
the
table
and
,
turning
,
peered
out
cautiously
.
*NL*
The
ragged
girl
retreated
and
the
urchin
in
the
corner
drew
his
legs
*NL*
carefully
beneath
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
puffed
his
pipe
calmly
and
put
his
great
mudded
boots
on
the
*NL*
back
part
of
the
stove
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
teh
hell
,
''
he
murmured
,
tranquilly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
screamed
and
shook
her
fists
before
her
husband
's
eyes
.
The
*NL*
rough
yellow
of
her
face
and
neck
flared
suddenly
crimson
.
She
began
*NL*
to
howl
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
puffed
imperturbably
at
his
pipe
for
a
time
,
but
finally
arose
and
*NL*
began
to
look
out
at
the
window
into
the
darkening
chaos
of
back
yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
've
been
drinkin
'
,
Mary
,
''
he
said
.
``
You
'd
better
let
up
on
the
*NL*
bot

,
ol'
woman
,
or
you
'll
git
done

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
liar
.
I
ai
n't
had
a
drop
,
''
she
roared
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
a
lurid
altercation
,
in
which
they
damned
each
other
's
souls
*NL*
with
frequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
babe
was
staring
out
from
under
the
table
,
his
small
face
working
*NL*
in
his
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ragged
girl
went
stealthily
over
to
the
corner
where
the
urchin
lay
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
yehs
hurted
much
,
Jimmie
?
''
she
whispered
timidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
damn
bit
!
See
?
''
growled
the
little
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
I
wash

blood

*NL*
*NL*
``
Naw

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
When

'll

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
his
face
to
the
wall
as
if
resolved
to
grimly
bide
his
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
quarrel
between
husband
and
wife
,
the
woman
was
victor
.
The
man
*NL*
grabbed
his
hat
and
rushed
from
the
room
,
apparently
determined
upon
a
*NL*
vengeful
drunk
.
She
followed
to
the
door
and
thundered
at
him
as
he
*NL*
made
his
way
down
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
returned
and
stirred
up
the
room
until
her
children
were
bobbing
*NL*
about
like
bubbles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Git
outa
deh
way
,
''
she
persistently
bawled
,
waving
feet
with
their
*NL*
dishevelled
shoes
near
the
heads
of
her
children
.
She
shrouded
*NL*
herself
,
puffing
and
snorting
,
in
a
cloud
of
steam
at
the
stove
,
and
*NL*
eventually
extracted
a
frying-pan
full
of
potatoes
that
hissed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
flourished
it
.
``
Come
teh
yer
suppers
,
now
,
''
she
cried
with
sudden
*NL*
exasperation
.
``
Hurry
up
,
now
,
er
I
'll
help
yeh
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
children
scrambled
hastily
.
With
prodigious
clatter
they
arranged
*NL*
themselves
at
table
.
The
babe
sat
with
his
feet
dangling
high
from
a
*NL*
precarious
infant
chair
and
gorged
his
small
stomach
.
Jimmie
forced
,
*NL*
with
feverish
rapidity
,
the
grease-enveloped
pieces
between
his
wounded
*NL*
lips
.
Maggie
,
with
side
glances
of
fear
of
interruption
,
ate
like
a
*NL*
small
pursued
tigress
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
sat
blinking
at
them
.
She
delivered
reproaches
,
swallowed
*NL*
potatoes
and
drank
from
a
yellow-brown
bottle
.
After
a
time
her
mood
*NL*
changed
and
she
wept
as
she
carried
little
Tommie
into
another
room
and
*NL*
laid
him
to
sleep
with
his
fists
doubled
in
an
old
quilt
of
faded
red
*NL*
and
green
grandeur
.
Then
she
came
and
moaned
by
the
stove
.
She
rocked
*NL*
to
and
fro
upon
a
chair
,
shedding
tears
and
crooning
miserably
to
the
*NL*
two
children
about
their
``
poor
mother
''
and
``
yer
fader
,
damn
`
is
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
plodded
between
the
table
and
the
chair
with
a
dish-pan
*NL*
on
it
.
She
tottered
on
her
small
legs
beneath
burdens
of
dishes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
sat
nursing
his
various
wounds
.
He
cast
furtive
glances
at
his
*NL*
mother
.
His
practised
eye
perceived
her
gradually
emerge
from
a
*NL*
muddled
mist
of
sentiment
until
her
brain
burned
in
drunken
heat
.
He
*NL*
sat
breathless
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
broke
a
plate
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
started
to
her
feet
as
if
propelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Good
Gawd
,
''
she
howled
.
Her
eyes
glittered
on
her
child
with
sudden
*NL*
hatred
.
The
fervent
red
of
her
face
turned
almost
to
purple
.
The
*NL*
little
boy
ran
to
the
halls
,
shrieking
like
a
monk
in
an
earthquake
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
floundered
about
in
darkness
until
he
found
the
stairs
.
He
*NL*
stumbled
,
panic-stricken
,
to
the
next
floor
.
An
old
woman
opened
a
*NL*
door
.
A
light
behind
her
threw
a
flare
on
the
urchin
's
quivering
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Gawd
,
child
,
what
is
it
dis
time
?
Is
yer
fader
beatin

Chapter
III
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
and
the
old
woman
listened
long
in
the
hall
.
Above
the
muffled
*NL*
roar
of
conversation
,
the
dismal
wailings
of
babies
at
night
,
the
*NL*
thumping
of
feet
in
unseen
corridors
and
rooms
,
mingled
with
the
sound
*NL*
of
varied
hoarse
shoutings
in
the
street
and
the
rattling
of
wheels
*NL*
over
cobbles
,
they
heard
the
screams
of
the
child
and
the
roars
of
the
*NL*
mother
die
away
to
a
feeble
moaning
and
a
subdued
bass
muttering
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
woman
was
a
gnarled
and
leathery
personage
who
could
don
,
at
*NL*
will
,
an
expression
of
great
virtue
.
She
possessed
a
small
music-box
*NL*
capable
of
one
tune
,
and
a
collection
of
``
God
bless
yehs
''
pitched
in
*NL*
assorted
keys
of
fervency
.
Each
day
she
took
a
position
upon
the
*NL*
stones
of
Fifth
Avenue
,
where
she
crooked
her
legs
under
her
and
*NL*
crouched
immovable
and
hideous
,
like
an
idol
.
She
received
daily
a
*NL*
small
sum
in
pennies
.
It
was
contributed
,
for
the
most
part
,
by
*NL*
persons
who
did
not
make
their
homes
in
that
vicinity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
when
a
lady
had
dropped
her
purse
on
the
sidewalk
,
the
gnarled
*NL*
woman
had
grabbed
it
and
smuggled
it
with
great
dexterity
beneath
her
*NL*
cloak
.
When
she
was
arrested
she
had
cursed
the
lady
into
a
partial
*NL*
swoon
,
and
with
her
aged
limbs
,
twisted
from
rheumatism
,
had
almost
*NL*
kicked
the
stomach
out
of
a
huge
policeman
whose
conduct
upon
that
*NL*
occasion
she
referred
to
when
she
said
:
``
The
police
,
damn
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
,
Jimmie
,
it
's
cursed
shame
,
''
she
said
.
``
Go
,
now
,
like
a
dear
an
'
*NL*
buy
me
a
can
,
an
'
if
yer
mudder
raises
`
ell
all
night
yehs
can
sleep
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
took
a
tendered
tin-pail
and
seven
pennies
and
departed
.
He
*NL*
passed
into
the
side
door
of
a
saloon
and
went
to
the
bar
.
Straining
*NL*
up
on
his
toes
he
raised
the
pail
and
pennies
as
high
as
his
arms
would
*NL*
let
him
.
He
saw
two
hands
thrust
down
and
take
them
.
Directly
the
*NL*
same
hands
let
down
the
filled
pail
and
he
left
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
front
of
the
gruesome
doorway
he
met
a
lurching
figure
.
It
was
his
*NL*
father
,
swaying
about
on
uncertain
legs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Give
me
deh
can
.
See
?
''
said
the
man
,
threateningly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
off
!
I
got
dis
can
fer
dat
ol'
woman
an
'
it
`
ud
be
dirt
teh
*NL*
swipe
it
.
See
?
''
cried
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
wrenched
the
pail
from
the
urchin
.
He
grasped
it
in
both
*NL*
hands
and
lifted
it
to
his
mouth
.
He
glued
his
lips
to
the
under
edge
*NL*
and
tilted
his
head
.
His
hairy
throat
swelled
until
it
seemed
to
grow
*NL*
near
his
chin
.
There
was
a
tremendous
gulping
movement
and
the
beer
*NL*
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
caught
his
breath
and
laughed
.
He
hit
his
son
on
the
head
with
*NL*
the
empty
pail
.
As
it
rolled
clanging
into
the
street
,
Jimmie
began
to
*NL*
scream
and
kicked
repeatedly
at
his
father
's
shins
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
at
deh
dirt
what
yeh
done
me
,
''
he
yelled
.
``
Deh
ol'
woman
`
ill
be
*NL*
raisin
'
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
retreated
to
the
middle
of
the
street
,
but
the
man
did
not
pursue
.
*NL*
He
staggered
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
club
hell
outa
yeh
when
I
ketch
yeh
,
''
he
shouted
,
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
evening
he
had
been
standing
against
a
bar
drinking
whiskies
*NL*
and
declaring
to
all
comers
,
confidentially
:
``
My
home
reg
`
lar
livin
'
*NL*
hell
!
Damndes
'
place

Reg
`
lar

Why

'
*NL*
here
thish
way
?
'Cause
home
reg
`
lar
livin
'
hell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
waited
a
long
time
in
the
street
and
then
crept
warily
up
*NL*
through
the
building
.
He
passed
with
great
caution
the
door
of
the
*NL*
gnarled
woman
,
and
finally
stopped
outside
his
home
and
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
hear
his
mother
moving
heavily
about
among
the
furniture
of
*NL*
the
room
.
She
was
chanting
in
a
mournful
voice
,
occasionally
*NL*
interjecting
bursts
of
volcanic
wrath
at
the
father
,
who
,
Jimmie
*NL*
judged
,
had
sunk
down
on
the
floor
or
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
deh
blazes
don
'
chere
try
teh
keep
Jim
from
fightin
'
?
I
'll
break
*NL*
her
jaw
,
''
she
suddenly
bellowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
mumbled
with
drunken
indifference
.
``
Ah
,
wha
'
deh
hell
.
W
`
a
's
*NL*
odds
?
Wha
'
makes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Because
he
tears
`
is
clothes
,
yeh
damn
fool
,
''
cried
the
woman
in
*NL*
supreme
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
husband
seemed
to
become
aroused
.
``
Go
teh
hell
,
''
he
thundered
*NL*
fiercely
in
reply
.
There
was
a
crash
against
the
door
and
something
*NL*
broke
into
clattering
fragments
.
Jimmie
partially
suppressed
a
howl
*NL*
and
darted
down
the
stairway
.
Below
he
paused
and
listened
.
He
heard
*NL*
howls
and
curses
,
groans
and
shrieks
,
confusingly
in
chorus
as
if
a
*NL*
battle
were
raging
.
With
all
was
the
crash
of
splintering
furniture
.
*NL*
The
eyes
of
the
urchin
glared
in
fear
that
one
of
them
would
discover
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Curious
faces
appeared
in
doorways
,
and
whispered
comments
passed
to
*NL*
and
fro
.
``
Ol'
Johnson
's
raisin
'
hell
agin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
stood
until
the
noises
ceased
and
the
other
inhabitants
of
the
*NL*
tenement
had
all
yawned
and
shut
their
doors
.
Then
he
crawled
upstairs
*NL*
with
the
caution
of
an
invader
of
a
panther
den
.
Sounds
of
labored
*NL*
breathing
came
through
the
broken
door-panels
.
He
pushed
the
door
open
*NL*
and
entered
,
quaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
glow
from
the
fire
threw
red
hues
over
the
bare
floor
,
the
cracked
*NL*
and
soiled
plastering
,
and
the
overturned
and
broken
furniture
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
middle
of
the
floor
lay
his
mother
asleep
.
In
one
corner
of
the
*NL*
room
his
father
's
limp
body
hung
across
the
seat
of
a
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
urchin
stole
forward
.
He
began
to
shiver
in
dread
of
awakening
his
*NL*
parents
.
His
mother
's
great
chest
was
heaving
painfully
.
Jimmie
*NL*
paused
and
looked
down
at
her
.
Her
face
was
inflamed
and
swollen
from
*NL*
drinking
.
Her
yellow
brows
shaded
eyelids
that
had
brown
blue
.
Her
*NL*
tangled
hair
tossed
in
waves
over
her
forehead
.
Her
mouth
was
set
in
*NL*
the
same
lines
of
vindictive
hatred
that
it
had
,
perhaps
,
borne
during
*NL*
the
fight
.
Her
bare
,
red
arms
were
thrown
out
above
her
head
in
*NL*
positions
of
exhaustion
,
something
,
mayhap
,
like
those
of
a
sated
*NL*
villain
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
urchin
bended
over
his
mother
.
He
was
fearful
lest
she
should
open
*NL*
her
eyes
,
and
the
dread
within
him
was
so
strong
,
that
he
could
not
*NL*
forbear
to
stare
,
but
hung
as
if
fascinated
over
the
woman
's
grim
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
her
eyes
opened
.
The
urchin
found
himself
looking
straight
*NL*
into
that
expression
,
which
,
it
would
seem
,
had
the
power
to
change
his
*NL*
blood
to
salt
.
He
howled
piercingly
and
fell
backward
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
floundered
for
a
moment
,
tossed
her
arms
about
her
head
as
if
*NL*
in
combat
,
and
again
began
to
snore
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
crawled
back
in
the
shadows
and
waited
.
A
noise
in
the
next
*NL*
room
had
followed
his
cry
at
the
discovery
that
his
mother
was
awake
.
*NL*
He
grovelled
in
the
gloom
,
the
eyes
from
out
his
drawn
face
riveted
*NL*
upon
the
intervening
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
heard
it
creak
,
and
then
the
sound
of
a
small
voice
came
to
him
.
*NL*
``
Jimmie
!
Jimmie
!
Are
yehs
dere
?
''
it
whispered
.
The
urchin
started
.
*NL*
The
thin
,
white
face
of
his
sister
looked
at
him
from
the
door-way
of
*NL*
the
other
room
.
She
crept
to
him
across
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
father
had
not
moved
,
but
lay
in
the
same
death-like
sleep
.
The
*NL*
mother
writhed
in
uneasy
slumber
,
her
chest
wheezing
as
if
she
were
in
*NL*
the
agonies
of
strangulation
.
Out
at
the
window
a
florid
moon
was
*NL*
peering
over
dark
roofs
,
and
in
the
distance
the
waters
of
a
river
*NL*
glimmered
pallidly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
small
frame
of
the
ragged
girl
was
quivering
.
Her
features
were
*NL*
haggard
from
weeping
,
and
her
eyes
gleamed
from
fear
.
She
grasped
the
*NL*
urchin
's
arm
in
her
little
trembling
hands
and
they
huddled
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
The
eyes
of
both
were
drawn
,
by
some
force
,
to
stare
at
the
*NL*
woman
's
face
,
for
they
thought
she
need
only
to
awake
and
all
fiends
*NL*
would
come
from
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
crouched
until
the
ghost-mists
of
dawn
appeared
at
the
window
,
*NL*
drawing
close
to
the
panes
,
and
looking
in
at
the
prostrate
,
heaving
*NL*
body
of
the
mother
.

Chapter
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
babe
,
Tommie
,
died
.
He
went
away
in
a
white
,
insignificant
coffin
,
*NL*
his
small
waxen
hand
clutching
a
flower
that
the
girl
,
Maggie
,
had
*NL*
stolen
from
an
Italian
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
and
Jimmie
lived
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inexperienced
fibres
of
the
boy
's
eyes
were
hardened
at
an
early
*NL*
age
.
He
became
a
young
man
of
leather
.
He
lived
some
red
years
*NL*
without
laboring
.
During
that
time
his
sneer
became
chronic
.
He
*NL*
studied
human
nature
in
the
gutter
,
and
found
it
no
worse
than
he
*NL*
thought
he
had
reason
to
believe
it
.
He
never
conceived
a
respect
for
*NL*
the
world
,
because
he
had
begun
with
no
idols
that
it
had
smashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
clad
his
soul
in
armor
by
means
of
happening
hilariously
in
at
a
*NL*
mission
church
where
a
man
composed
his
sermons
of
``
yous
.
''
While
they
*NL*
got
warm
at
the
stove
,
he
told
his
hearers
just
where
he
calculated
*NL*
they
stood
with
the
Lord
.
Many
of
the
sinners
were
impatient
over
the
*NL*
pictured
depths
of
their
degradation
.
They
were
waiting
for
*NL*
soup-tickets
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
reader
of
words
of
wind-demons
might
have
been
able
to
see
the
*NL*
portions
of
a
dialogue
pass
to
and
fro
between
the
exhorter
and
his
*NL*
hearers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
damned
,
''
said
the
preacher
.
And
the
reader
of
sounds
might
*NL*
have
seen
the
reply
go
forth
from
the
ragged
people
:
``
Where
's
our
soup
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
and
a
companion
sat
in
a
rear
seat
and
commented
upon
the
things
*NL*
that
did
n't
concern
them
,
with
all
the
freedom
of
English
gentlemen
.
*NL*
When
they
grew
thirsty
and
went
out
their
minds
confused
the
speaker
*NL*
with
Christ
.
*NL*
*NL*
Momentarily
,
Jimmie
was
sullen
with
thoughts
of
a
hopeless
altitude
*NL*
where
grew
fruit
.
His
companion
said
that
if
he
should
ever
meet
God
*NL*
he
would
ask
for
a
million
dollars
and
a
bottle
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
's
occupation
for
a
long
time
was
to
stand
on
streetcorners
and
*NL*
watch
the
world
go
by
,
dreaming
blood-red
dreams
at
the
passing
of
*NL*
pretty
women
.
He
menaced
mankind
at
the
intersections
of
streets
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
corners
he
was
in
life
and
of
life
.
The
world
was
going
on
and
*NL*
he
was
there
to
perceive
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
maintained
a
belligerent
attitude
toward
all
well-dressed
men
.
To
*NL*
him
fine
raiment
was
allied
to
weakness
,
and
all
good
coats
covered
*NL*
faint
hearts
.
He
and
his
order
were
kings
,
to
a
certain
extent
,
over
*NL*
the
men
of
untarnished
clothes
,
because
these
latter
dreaded
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
to
be
either
killed
or
laughed
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
Above
all
things
he
despised
obvious
Christians
and
ciphers
with
the
*NL*
chrysanthemums
of
aristocracy
in
their
button-holes
.
He
considered
*NL*
himself
above
both
of
these
classes
.
He
was
afraid
of
neither
the
*NL*
devil
nor
the
leader
of
society
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
had
a
dollar
in
his
pocket
his
satisfaction
with
existence
was
*NL*
the
greatest
thing
in
the
world
.
So
,
eventually
,
he
felt
obliged
to
*NL*
work
.
His
father
died
and
his
mother
's
years
were
divided
up
into
*NL*
periods
of
thirty
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
a
truck
driver
.
He
was
given
the
charge
of
a
painstaking
*NL*
pair
of
horses
and
a
large
rattling
truck
.
He
invaded
the
turmoil
and
*NL*
tumble
of
the
down-town
streets
and
learned
to
breathe
maledictory
*NL*
defiance
at
the
police
who
occasionally
used
to
climb
up
,
drag
him
from
*NL*
his
perch
and
beat
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
lower
part
of
the
city
he
daily
involved
himself
in
hideous
*NL*
tangles
.
If
he
and
his
team
chanced
to
be
in
the
rear
he
preserved
a
*NL*
demeanor
of
serenity
,
crossing
his
legs
and
bursting
forth
into
yells
*NL*
when
foot
passengers
took
dangerous
dives
beneath
the
noses
of
his
*NL*
champing
horses
.
He
smoked
his
pipe
calmly
for
he
knew
that
his
pay
*NL*
was
marching
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
in
the
front
and
the
key-truck
of
chaos
,
he
entered
terrifically
*NL*
into
the
quarrel
that
was
raging
to
and
fro
among
the
drivers
on
their
*NL*
high
seats
,
and
sometimes
roared
oaths
and
violently
got
himself
*NL*
arrested
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
his
sneer
grew
so
that
it
turned
its
glare
upon
all
*NL*
things
.
He
became
so
sharp
that
he
believed
in
nothing
.
To
him
the
*NL*
police
were
always
actuated
by
malignant
impulses
and
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
world
was
composed
,
for
the
most
part
,
of
despicable
creatures
who
were
*NL*
all
trying
to
take
advantage
of
him
and
with
whom
,
in
defense
,
he
was
*NL*
obliged
to
quarrel
on
all
possible
occasions
.
He
himself
occupied
a
*NL*
down-trodden
position
that
had
a
private
but
distinct
element
of
*NL*
grandeur
in
its
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
complete
cases
of
aggravated
idiocy
were
,
to
his
mind
,
rampant
*NL*
upon
the
front
platforms
of
all
the
street
cars
.
At
first
his
tongue
*NL*
strove
with
these
beings
,
but
he
eventually
was
superior
.
He
became
*NL*
immured
like
an
African
cow
.
In
him
grew
a
majestic
contempt
for
those
*NL*
strings
of
street
cars
that
followed
him
like
intent
bugs
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
fell
into
the
habit
,
when
starting
on
a
long
journey
,
of
fixing
his
*NL*
eye
on
a
high
and
distant
object
,
commanding
his
horses
to
begin
,
and
*NL*
then
going
into
a
sort
of
a
trance
of
observation
.
Multitudes
of
*NL*
drivers
might
howl
in
his
rear
,
and
passengers
might
load
him
with
*NL*
opprobrium
,
he
would
not
awaken
until
some
blue
policeman
turned
red
*NL*
and
began
to
frenziedly
tear
bridles
and
beat
the
soft
noses
of
the
*NL*
responsible
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
paused
to
contemplate
the
attitude
of
the
police
toward
himself
*NL*
and
his
fellows
,
he
believed
that
they
were
the
only
men
in
the
city
*NL*
who
had
no
rights
.
When
driving
about
,
he
felt
that
he
was
held
liable
*NL*
by
the
police
for
anything
that
might
occur
in
the
streets
,
and
was
the
*NL*
common
prey
of
all
energetic
officials
.
In
revenge
,
he
resolved
never
*NL*
to
move
out
of
the
way
of
anything
,
until
formidable
circumstances
,
or
*NL*
a
much
larger
man
than
himself
forced
him
to
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Foot-passengers
were
mere
pestering
flies
with
an
insane
disregard
for
*NL*
their
legs
and
his
convenience
.
He
could
not
conceive
their
maniacal
*NL*
desires
to
cross
the
streets
.
Their
madness
smote
him
with
eternal
*NL*
amazement
.
He
was
continually
storming
at
them
from
his
throne
.
He
*NL*
sat
aloft
and
denounced
their
frantic
leaps
,
plunges
,
dives
and
*NL*
straddles
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
would
thrust
at
,
or
parry
,
the
noses
of
his
champing
horses
,
*NL*
making
them
swing
their
heads
and
move
their
feet
,
disturbing
a
solid
*NL*
dreamy
repose
,
he
swore
at
the
men
as
fools
,
for
he
himself
could
*NL*
perceive
that
Providence
had
caused
it
clearly
to
be
written
,
that
he
*NL*
and
his
team
had
the
unalienable
right
to
stand
in
the
proper
path
of
*NL*
the
sun
chariot
,
and
if
they
so
minded
,
obstruct
its
mission
or
take
a
*NL*
wheel
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
,
perhaps
,
if
the
god-driver
had
an
ungovernable
desire
to
step
*NL*
down
,
put
up
his
flame-colored
fists
and
manfully
dispute
the
right
of
*NL*
way
,
he
would
have
probably
been
immediately
opposed
by
a
scowling
*NL*
mortal
with
two
sets
of
very
hard
knuckles
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
possible
,
perhaps
,
that
this
young
man
would
have
derided
,
in
an
*NL*
axle-wide
alley
,
the
approach
of
a
flying
ferry
boat
.
Yet
he
achieved
*NL*
a
respect
for
a
fire
engine
.
As
one
charged
toward
his
truck
,
he
would
*NL*
drive
fearfully
upon
a
sidewalk
,
threatening
untold
people
with
*NL*
annihilation
.
When
an
engine
would
strike
a
mass
of
blocked
trucks
,
*NL*
splitting
it
into
fragments
,
as
a
blow
annihilates
a
cake
of
ice
,
*NL*
Jimmie
's
team
could
usually
be
observed
high
and
safe
,
with
whole
*NL*
wheels
,
on
the
sidewalk
.
The
fearful
coming
of
the
engine
could
break
*NL*
up
the
most
intricate
muddle
of
heavy
vehicles
at
which
the
police
had
*NL*
been
swearing
for
the
half
of
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
fire
engine
was
enshrined
in
his
heart
as
an
appalling
thing
that
he
*NL*
loved
with
a
distant
dog-like
devotion
.
They
had
been
known
to
*NL*
overturn
street-cars
.
Those
leaping
horses
,
striking
sparks
from
the
*NL*
cobbles
in
their
forward
lunge
,
were
creatures
to
be
ineffably
admired
.
*NL*
The
clang
of
the
gong
pierced
his
breast
like
a
noise
of
remembered
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Jimmie
was
a
little
boy
,
he
began
to
be
arrested
.
Before
he
*NL*
reached
a
great
age
,
he
had
a
fair
record
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
developed
too
great
a
tendency
to
climb
down
from
his
truck
and
*NL*
fight
with
other
drivers
.
He
had
been
in
quite
a
number
of
*NL*
miscellaneous
fights
,
and
in
some
general
barroom
rows
that
had
become
*NL*
known
to
the
police
.
Once
he
had
been
arrested
for
assaulting
a
*NL*
Chinaman
.
Two
women
in
different
parts
of
the
city
,
and
entirely
*NL*
unknown
to
each
other
,
caused
him
considerable
annoyance
by
breaking
*NL*
forth
,
simultaneously
,
at
fateful
intervals
,
into
wailings
about
*NL*
marriage
and
support
and
infants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nevertheless
,
he
had
,
on
a
certain
star-lit
evening
,
said
wonderingly
*NL*
and
quite
reverently
:
``
Deh
moon
looks
like
hell
,
do
n't
it
?

Chapter
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
,
Maggie
,
blossomed
in
a
mud
puddle
.
She
grew
to
be
a
most
*NL*
rare
and
wonderful
production
of
a
tenement
district
,
a
pretty
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
the
dirt
of
Rum
Alley
seemed
to
be
in
her
veins
.
The
*NL*
philosophers
up-stairs
,
down-stairs
and
on
the
same
floor
,
puzzled
over
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
a
child
,
playing
and
fighting
with
gamins
in
the
street
,
dirt
*NL*
disguised
her
.
Attired
in
tatters
and
grime
,
she
went
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
came
a
time
,
however
,
when
the
young
men
of
the
vicinity
said
:
*NL*
``
Dat
Johnson
goil
is
a
puty
good
looker
.
''
About
this
period
her
*NL*
brother
remarked
to
her
:
``
Mag
,
I
'll
tell
yeh
dis
!
See
?
Yeh
've
edder
*NL*
got
teh
go
teh
hell
or
go
teh
work
!
''
Whereupon
she
went
to
work
,
*NL*
having
the
feminine
aversion
of
going
to
hell
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
a
chance
,
she
got
a
position
in
an
establishment
where
they
made
*NL*
collars
and
cuffs
.
She
received
a
stool
and
a
machine
in
a
room
where
*NL*
sat
twenty
girls
of
various
shades
of
yellow
discontent
.
She
perched
*NL*
on
the
stool
and
treadled
at
her
machine
all
day
,
turning
out
collars
,
*NL*
the
name
of
whose
brand
could
be
noted
for
its
irrelevancy
to
anything
*NL*
in
connection
with
collars
.
At
night
she
returned
home
to
her
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
grew
large
enough
to
take
the
vague
position
of
head
of
the
*NL*
family
.
As
incumbent
of
that
office
,
he
stumbled
up-stairs
late
at
*NL*
night
,
as
his
father
had
done
before
him
.
He
reeled
about
the
room
,
*NL*
swearing
at
his
relations
,
or
went
to
sleep
on
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
had
gradually
arisen
to
that
degree
of
fame
that
she
could
*NL*
bandy
words
with
her
acquaintances
among
the
police-justices
.
*NL*
Court-officials
called
her
by
her
first
name
.
When
she
appeared
they
*NL*
pursued
a
course
which
had
been
theirs
for
months
.
They
invariably
*NL*
grinned
and
cried
out
:
``
Hello
,
Mary
,
you
here
again
?
''
Her
grey
head
*NL*
wagged
in
many
a
court
.
She
always
besieged
the
bench
with
voluble
*NL*
excuses
,
explanations
,
apologies
and
prayers
.
Her
flaming
face
and
*NL*
rolling
eyes
were
a
sort
of
familiar
sight
on
the
island
.
She
measured
*NL*
time
by
means
of
sprees
,
and
was
eternally
swollen
and
dishevelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
the
young
man
,
Pete
,
who
as
a
lad
had
smitten
the
Devil
's
Row
*NL*
urchin
in
the
back
of
the
head
and
put
to
flight
the
antagonists
of
his
*NL*
friend
,
Jimmie
,
strutted
upon
the
scene
.
He
met
Jimmie
one
day
on
the
*NL*
street
,
promised
to
take
him
to
a
boxing
match
in
Williamsburg
,
and
*NL*
called
for
him
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
observed
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
on
a
table
in
the
Johnson
home
and
dangled
his
checked
legs
with
*NL*
an
enticing
nonchalance
.
His
hair
was
curled
down
over
his
forehead
in
*NL*
an
oiled
bang
.
His
rather
pugged
nose
seemed
to
revolt
from
contact
*NL*
with
a
bristling
moustache
of
short
,
wire-like
hairs
.
His
blue
*NL*
double-breasted
coat
,
edged
with
black
braid
,
buttoned
close
to
a
red
*NL*
puff
tie
,
and
his
patent-leather
shoes
looked
like
murder-fitted
*NL*
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mannerisms
stamped
him
as
a
man
who
had
a
correct
sense
of
his
*NL*
personal
superiority
.
There
was
valor
and
contempt
for
circumstances
*NL*
in
the
glance
of
his
eye
.
He
waved
his
hands
like
a
man
of
the
world
,
*NL*
who
dismisses
religion
and
philosophy
,
and
says
``
Fudge
.
''
He
had
*NL*
certainly
seen
everything
and
with
each
curl
of
his
lip
,
he
declared
*NL*
that
it
amounted
to
nothing
.
Maggie
thought
he
must
be
a
very
elegant
*NL*
and
graceful
bartender
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
telling
tales
to
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
watched
him
furtively
,
with
half-closed
eyes
,
lit
with
a
vague
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hully
gee
!
Dey
makes
me
tired
,
''
he
said
.
``
Mos

e

*NL*
*NL*
``

said
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
nodded
understandingly
.
Over
his
features
played
an
eager
*NL*
desire
to
state
the
amount
of
his
valor
in
a
similar
crisis
,
but
the
*NL*
narrator
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
The
two
held
a
technical
discussion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dat

a

Pete
,
in

*NL*
*NL*
As
Jimmie
and
his
friend
exchanged
tales
descriptive
of
their
prowess
,
*NL*
Maggie
leaned
back
in
the
shadow
.
Her
eyes
dwelt
wonderingly
and
*NL*
rather
wistfully
upon
Pete
's
face
.
The
broken
furniture
,
grimey
walls
,
*NL*
and
general
disorder
and
dirt
of
her
home
of
a
sudden
appeared
before
*NL*
her
and
began
to
take
a
potential
aspect
.
Pete
's
aristocratic
person
*NL*
looked
as
if
it
might
soil
.
She
looked
keenly
at
him
,
occasionally
,
*NL*
wondering
if
he
was
feeling
contempt
.
But
Pete
seemed
to
be
enveloped
*NL*
in
reminiscence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hully
gee
,
''
said
he
,
``
dose
mugs
ca
n't
phase

Dey
knows
I
kin
wipe
*NL*
up
deh
street
wid
any

`
ree

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
said
,
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
,
''
his
voice
was
burdened
with
disdain
*NL*
for
the
inevitable
and
contempt
for
anything
that
fate
might
compel
him
*NL*
to
endure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
perceived
that
here
was
the
beau
ideal
of
a
man
.
Her
dim
*NL*
thoughts
were
often
searching
for
far
away
lands
where
,
as
God
says
,
*NL*
the
little
hills
sing
together
in
the
morning
.
Under
the
trees
of
her
*NL*
dream-gardens
there
had
always
walked
a
lover
.

Chapter

*NL*
*NL*
Pete
took
note
of
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Mag
,
I
'm
stuck
on
yer
shape
.
It
's
outa
sight
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
parenthetically
,
with
an
affable
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
became
aware
that
she
was
listening
closely
,
he
grew
still
more
*NL*
eloquent
in
his
descriptions
of
various
happenings
in
his
career
.
It
*NL*
appeared
that
he
was
invincible
in
fights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
''
he
said
,
referring
to
a
man
with
whom
he
had
had
a
*NL*
misunderstanding
,
``
dat
mug
scrapped
like
a
damn
dago
.
Dat
's
right
.
He
*NL*
was
dead
easy
.
See
?
He

t

was
a
scrapper
.
But
he
foun
'
out
*NL*
diff
`
ent

Hully
gee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
to
and
fro
in
the
small
room
,
which
seemed
then
to
grow
even
*NL*
smaller
and
unfit
to
hold
his
dignity
,
the
attribute
of
a
supreme
*NL*
warrior
.
That
swing
of
the
shoulders
that
had
frozen
the
timid
when
he
*NL*
was
but
a
lad
had
increased
with
his
growth
and
education
at
the
ratio
*NL*
of
ten
to
one
.
It
,
combined
with
the
sneer
upon
his
mouth
,
told
*NL*
mankind
that
there
was
nothing
in
space
which
could
appall
him
.
Maggie
*NL*
marvelled
at
him
and
surrounded
him
with
greatness
.
She
vaguely
tried
*NL*
to
calculate
the
altitude
of
the
pinnacle
from
which
he
must
have
*NL*
looked
down
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
met
a
chump
deh
odder
day
way
up
in

he
said
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
With
Jimmie
in
his
company
,
Pete
departed
in
a
sort
of
a
blaze
of
glory
*NL*
from
the
Johnson
home
.
Maggie
,
leaning
from
the
window
,
watched
him
as
*NL*
he
walked
down
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
formidable
man
who
disdained
the
strength
of
a
world
full
of
*NL*
fists
.
Here
was
one
who
had
contempt
for
brass-clothed
power
;
one
*NL*
whose
knuckles
could
defiantly
ring
against
the
granite
of
law
.
He
was
*NL*
a
knight
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
went
from
under
the
glimmering
street-lamp
and
passed
into
*NL*
shadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
Turning
,
Maggie
contemplated
the
dark
,
dust-stained
walls
,
and
the
*NL*
scant
and
crude
furniture
of
her
home
.
A
clock
,
in
a
splintered
and
*NL*
battered
oblong
box
of
varnished
wood
,
she
suddenly
regarded
as
an
*NL*
abomination
.
She
noted
that
it
ticked
raspingly
.
The
almost
vanished
*NL*
flowers
in
the
carpet-pattern
,
she
conceived
to
be
newly
hideous
.
Some
*NL*
faint
attempts
she
had
made
with
blue
ribbon
,
to
freshen
the
appearance
*NL*
of
a
dingy
curtain
,
she
now
saw
to
be
piteous
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
what
Pete
dined
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
reflected
upon
the
collar
and
cuff
factory
.
It
began
to
appear
to
*NL*
her
mind
as
a
dreary
place
of
endless
grinding
.
Pete
's
elegant
*NL*
occupation
brought
him
,
no
doubt
,
into
contact
with
people
who
had
*NL*
money
and
manners
.
It
was
probable
that
he
had
a
large
acquaintance
of
*NL*
pretty
girls
.
He
must
have
great
sums
of
money
to
spend
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
the
earth
was
composed
of
hardships
and
insults
.
She
felt
*NL*
instant
admiration
for
a
man
who
openly
defied
it
.
She
thought
that
if
*NL*
the
grim
angel
of
death
should
clutch
his
heart
,
Pete
would
shrug
his
*NL*
shoulders
and
say
:
``
Oh
,
ev'ry
t
`
ing
goes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
anticipated
that
he
would
come
again
shortly
.
She
spent
some
of
*NL*
her
week
's
pay
in
the
purchase
of
flowered
cretonne
for
a
lambrequin
.
*NL*
She
made
it
with
infinite
care
and
hung
it
to
the
slightly-careening
*NL*
mantel
,
over
the
stove
,
in
the
kitchen
.
She
studied
it
with
painful
*NL*
anxiety
from
different
points
in
the
room
.
She
wanted
it
to
look
well
*NL*
on
Sunday
night
when
,
perhaps
,
Jimmie
's
friend
would
come
.
On
Sunday
*NL*
night
,
however
,
Pete
did
not
appear
.
*NL*
*NL*
Afterward
the
girl
looked
at
it
with
a
sense
of
humiliation
.
She
was
*NL*
now
convinced
that
Pete
was
superior
to
admiration
for
lambrequins
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
evenings
later
Pete
entered
with
fascinating
innovations
in
his
*NL*
apparel
.
As
she
had
seen
him
twice
and
he
had
different
suits
on
each
*NL*
time
,
Maggie
had
a
dim
impression
that
his
wardrobe
was
prodigiously
*NL*
extensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Mag
,
''
he
said
,
``
put
on
yer
bes
'
duds
Friday
night
an
'
I
'll
take
*NL*
yehs
teh
deh
show
.
See
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spent
a
few
moments
in
flourishing
his
clothes
and
then
vanished
,
*NL*
without
having
glanced
at
the
lambrequin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Over
the
eternal
collars
and
cuffs
in
the
factory
Maggie
spent
the
most
*NL*
of
three
days
in
making
imaginary
sketches
of
Pete
and
his
daily
*NL*
environment
.
She
imagined
some
half
dozen
women
in
love
with
him
and
*NL*
thought
he
must
lean
dangerously
toward
an
indefinite
one
,
whom
she
*NL*
pictured
with
great
charms
of
person
,
but
with
an
altogether
*NL*
contemptible
disposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
he
must
live
in
a
blare
of
pleasure
.
He
had
friends
,
and
*NL*
people
who
were
afraid
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
golden
glitter
of
the
place
where
Pete
was
to
take
her
.
An
*NL*
entertainment
of
many
hues
and
many
melodies
where
she
was
afraid
she
*NL*
might
appear
small
and
mouse-colored
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mother
drank
whiskey
all
Friday
morning
.
With
lurid
face
and
*NL*
tossing
hair
she
cursed
and
destroyed
furniture
all
Friday
afternoon
.
*NL*
When
Maggie
came
home
at
half-past
six
her
mother
lay
asleep
amidst
the
*NL*
wreck
of
chairs
and
a
table
.
Fragments
of
various
household
utensils
*NL*
were
scattered
about
the
floor
.
She
had
vented
some
phase
of
drunken
*NL*
fury
upon
the
lambrequin
.
It
lay
in
a
bedraggled
heap
in
the
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hah
,
''
she
snorted
,
sitting
up
suddenly
,
``
where
deh
hell
yeh
been
?
Why
*NL*
deh
hell
don
'
yeh
come
home
earlier
?
Been
loafin

`
round
deh
streets

*NL*
Yer
gettin

''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Pete
arrived
Maggie
,
in
a
worn
black
dress
,
was
waiting
for
him
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
a
floor
strewn
with
wreckage
.
The
curtain
at
the
window
*NL*
had
been
pulled
by
a
heavy
hand
and
hung
by
one
tack
,
dangling
to
and
*NL*
fro
in
the
draft
through
the
cracks
at
the
sash
.
The
knots
of
blue
*NL*
ribbons
appeared
like
violated
flowers
.
The
fire
in
the
stove
had
gone
*NL*
out
.
The
displaced
lids
and
open
doors
showed
heaps
of
sullen
grey
*NL*
ashes
.
The
remnants
of
a
meal
,
ghastly
,
like
dead
flesh
,
lay
in
a
*NL*
corner
.
Maggie
's
red
mother
,
stretched
on
the
floor
,
blasphemed
and
*NL*
gave
her
daughter
a
bad
name
.

Chapter
VII
*NL*
*NL*
An
orchestra
of
yellow
silk
women
and
bald-headed
men
on
an
elevated
*NL*
stage
near
the
centre
of
a
great
green-hued
hall
,
played
a
popular
*NL*
waltz
.
The
place
was
crowded
with
people
grouped
about
little
tables
.
*NL*
A
battalion
of
waiters
slid
among
the
throng
,
carrying
trays
of
beer
*NL*
glasses
and
making
change
from
the
inexhaustible
vaults
of
their
*NL*
trousers
pockets
.
Little
boys
,
in
the
costumes
of
French
chefs
,
*NL*
paraded
up
and
down
the
irregular
aisles
vending
fancy
cakes
.
There
*NL*
was
a
low
rumble
of
conversation
and
a
subdued
clinking
of
glasses
.
*NL*
Clouds
of
tobacco
smoke
rolled
and
wavered
high
in
air
about
the
dull
*NL*
gilt
of
the
chandeliers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
vast
crowd
had
an
air
throughout
of
having
just
quitted
labor
.
Men
*NL*
with
calloused
hands
and
attired
in
garments
that
showed
the
wear
of
an
*NL*
endless
trudge
for
a
living
,
smoked
their
pipes
contentedly
and
spent
*NL*
five
,
ten
,
or
perhaps
fifteen
cents
for
beer
.
There
was
a
mere
*NL*
sprinkling
of
kid-gloved
men
who
smoked
cigars
purchased
elsewhere
.
*NL*
The
great
body
of
the
crowd
was
composed
of
people
who
showed
that
all
*NL*
day
they
strove
with
their
hands
.
Quiet
Germans
,
with
maybe
their
*NL*
wives
and
two
or
three
children
,
sat
listening
to
the
music
,
with
the
*NL*
expressions
of
happy
cows
.
An
occasional
party
of
sailors
from
a
*NL*
war-ship
,
their
faces
pictures
of
sturdy
health
,
spent
the
earlier
*NL*
hours
of
the
evening
at
the
small
round
tables
.
Very
infrequent
tipsy
*NL*
men
,
swollen
with
the
value
of
their
opinions
,
engaged
their
companions
*NL*
in
earnest
and
confidential
conversation
.
In
the
balcony
,
and
here
and
*NL*
there
below
,
shone
the
impassive
faces
of
women
.
The
nationalities
of
*NL*
the
Bowery
beamed
upon
the
stage
from
all
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
aggressively
walked
up
a
side
aisle
and
took
seats
with
Maggie
at
*NL*
a
table
beneath
the
balcony
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Two
beehs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Leaning
back
he
regarded
with
eyes
of
superiority
the
scene
before
*NL*
them
.
This
attitude
affected
Maggie
strongly
.
A
man
who
could
regard
*NL*
such
a
sight
with
indifference
must
be
accustomed
to
very
great
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
obvious
that
Pete
had
been
to
this
place
many
times
before
,
and
*NL*
was
very
familiar
with
it
.
A
knowledge
of
this
fact
made
Maggie
feel
*NL*
little
and
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
extremely
gracious
and
attentive
.
He
displayed
the
*NL*
consideration
of
a
cultured
gentleman
who
knew
what
was
due
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
what
deh
hell
?
Bring
deh
lady
a
big
glass
!
What
deh
hell
use
is
*NL*
dat
pony
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
fresh
,
now
,
''
said
the
waiter
,
with
some
warmth
,
as
he
*NL*
departed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
git
off
deh
eart
'
,
''
said
Pete
,
after
the
other
's
retreating
form
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
perceived
that
Pete
brought
forth
all
his
elegance
and
all
his
*NL*
knowledge
of
high-class
customs
for
her
benefit
.
Her
heart
warmed
as
*NL*
she
reflected
upon
his
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orchestra
of
yellow
silk
women
and
bald-headed
men
gave
vent
to
a
*NL*
few
bars
of
anticipatory
music
and
a
girl
,
in
a
pink
dress
with
short
*NL*
skirts
,
galloped
upon
the
stage
.
She
smiled
upon
the
throng
as
if
in
*NL*
acknowledgment
of
a
warm
welcome
,
and
began
to
walk
to
and
fro
,
making
*NL*
profuse
gesticulations
and
singing
,
in
brazen
soprano
tones
,
a
song
,
*NL*
the
words
of
which
were
inaudible
.
When
she
broke
into
the
swift
*NL*
rattling
measures
of
a
chorus
some
half-tipsy
men
near
the
stage
joined
*NL*
in
the
rollicking
refrain
and
glasses
were
pounded
rhythmically
upon
*NL*
the
tables
.
People
leaned
forward
to
watch
her
and
to
try
to
catch
the
*NL*
words
of
the
song
.
When
she
vanished
there
were
long
rollings
of
*NL*
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Obedient
to
more
anticipatory
bars
,
she
reappeared
amidst
the
*NL*
half-suppressed
cheering
of
the
tipsy
men
.
The
orchestra
plunged
into
*NL*
dance
music
and
the
laces
of
the
dancer
fluttered
and
flew
in
the
glare
*NL*
of
gas
jets
.
She
divulged
the
fact
that
she
was
attired
in
some
half
*NL*
dozen
skirts
.
It
was
patent
that
any
one
of
them
would
have
proved
*NL*
adequate
for
the
purpose
for
which
skirts
are
intended
.
An
occasional
*NL*
man
bent
forward
,
intent
upon
the
pink
stockings
.
Maggie
wondered
at
*NL*
the
splendor
of
the
costume
and
lost
herself
in
calculations
of
the
*NL*
cost
of
the
silks
and
laces
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dancer
's
smile
of
stereotyped
enthusiasm
was
turned
for
ten
minutes
*NL*
upon
the
faces
of
her
audience
.
In
the
finale
she
fell
into
some
of
*NL*
those
grotesque
attitudes
which
were
at
the
time
popular
among
the
*NL*
dancers
in
the
theatres
up-town
,
giving
to
the
Bowery
public
the
*NL*
phantasies
of
the
aristocratic
theatre-going
public
,
at
reduced
rates
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Pete
,
''
said
Maggie
,
leaning
forward
,
``
dis
is
great
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
said
Pete
,
with
proper
complacence
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
ventriloquist
followed
the
dancer
.
He
held
two
fantastic
dolls
on
*NL*
his
knees
.
He
made
them
sing
mournful
ditties
and
say
funny
things
*NL*
about
geography
and
Ireland
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
dose
little
men
talk
?
''
asked
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naw
,
''
said
Pete
,
``
it
's
some
damn
fake
.
See
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
girls
,
on
the
bills
as
sisters
,
came
forth
and
sang
a
duet
that
is
*NL*
heard
occasionally
at
concerts
given
under
church
auspices
.
They
*NL*
supplemented
it
with
a
dance
which
of
course
can
never
be
seen
at
*NL*
concerts
given
under
church
auspices
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
the
duettists
had
retired
,
a
woman
of
debatable
age
sang
a
negro
*NL*
melody
.
The
chorus
necessitated
some
grotesque
waddlings
supposed
to
*NL*
be
an
imitation
of
a
plantation
darkey
,
under
the
influence
,
probably
,
*NL*
of
music
and
the
moon
.
The
audience
was
just
enthusiastic
enough
over
*NL*
it
to
have
her
return
and
sing
a
sorrowful
lay
,
whose
lines
told
of
a
*NL*
mother
's
love
and
a
sweetheart
who
waited
and
a
young
man
who
was
lost
*NL*
at
sea
under
the
most
harrowing
circumstances
.
From
the
faces
of
a
*NL*
score
or
so
in
the
crowd
,
the
self-contained
look
faded
.
Many
heads
*NL*
were
bent
forward
with
eagerness
and
sympathy
.
As
the
last
distressing
*NL*
sentiment
of
the
piece
was
brought
forth
,
it
was
greeted
by
that
kind
*NL*
of
applause
which
rings
as
sincere
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
final
effort
,
the
singer
rendered
some
verses
which
described
a
*NL*
vision
of
Britain
being
annihilated
by
America
,
and
Ireland
bursting
*NL*
her
bonds
.
A
carefully
prepared
crisis
was
reached
in
the
last
line
of
*NL*
the
last
verse
,
where
the
singer
threw
out
her
arms
and
cried
,
``
The
*NL*
star-spangled
banner
.
''
Instantly
a
great
cheer
swelled
from
the
*NL*
throats
of
the
assemblage
of
the
masses
.
There
was
a
heavy
rumble
of
*NL*
booted
feet
thumping
the
floor
.
Eyes
gleamed
with
sudden
fire
,
and
*NL*
calloused
hands
waved
frantically
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
few
moments
'
rest
,
the
orchestra
played
crashingly
,
and
a
small
*NL*
fat
man
burst
out
upon
the
stage
.
He
began
to
roar
a
song
and
stamp
*NL*
back
and
forth
before
the
foot-lights
,
wildly
waving
a
glossy
silk
hat
*NL*
and
throwing
leers
,
or
smiles
,
broadcast
.
He
made
his
face
into
*NL*
fantastic
grimaces
until
he
looked
like
a
pictured
devil
on
a
Japanese
*NL*
kite
.
The
crowd
laughed
gleefully
.
His
short
,
fat
legs
were
never
*NL*
still
a
moment
.
He
shouted
and
roared
and
bobbed
his
shock
of
red
wig
*NL*
until
the
audience
broke
out
in
excited
applause
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
did
not
pay
much
attention
to
the
progress
of
events
upon
the
*NL*
stage
.
He
was
drinking
beer
and
watching
Maggie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cheeks
were
blushing
with
excitement
and
her
eyes
were
glistening
.
*NL*
She
drew
deep
breaths
of
pleasure
.
No
thoughts
of
the
atmosphere
of
*NL*
the
collar
and
cuff
factory
came
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
orchestra
crashed
finally
,
they
jostled
their
way
to
the
*NL*
sidewalk
with
the
crowd
.
Pete
took
Maggie
's
arm
and
pushed
a
way
for
*NL*
her
,
offering
to
fight
with
a
man
or
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
Maggie
's
home
at
a
late
hour
and
stood
for
a
moment
in
*NL*
front
of
the
gruesome
doorway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Mag
,
''
said
Pete
,
``
give
us
a
kiss
for
takin
'
yeh
teh
deh
show
,
*NL*
will

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
laughed
,
as
if
startled
,
and
drew
away
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naw
,
Pete
,
''
she
said
,
``
dat
was
n't
in
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
?
''
urged
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
retreated
nervously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
?
''
repeated
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
darted
into
the
hall
,
and
up
the
stairs
.
She
turned
and
smiled
*NL*
at
him
,
then
disappeared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
walked
slowly
down
the
street
.
He
had
something
of
an
astonished
*NL*
expression
upon
his
features
.
He
paused
under
a
lamp-post
and
breathed
*NL*
a
low
breath
of
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gawd
,
''
he
said
,
``
I
wonner
if
I
've
been
played
fer

Chapter
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
As
thoughts
of
Pete
came
to
Maggie
's
mind
,
she
began
to
have
an
intense
*NL*
dislike
for
all
of
her
dresses
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
deh

ails

?
What

and
fussin

?
*NL*
Good
Gawd
,
''
her
mother
would
frequently
roar
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
note
,
with
more
interest
,
the
well-dressed
women
she
met
*NL*
on
the
avenues
.
She
envied
elegance
and
soft
palms
.
She
craved
those
*NL*
adornments
of
person
which
she
saw
every
day
on
the
street
,
conceiving
*NL*
them
to
be
allies
of
vast
importance
to
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
Studying
faces
,
she
thought
many
of
the
women
and
girls
she
chanced
to
*NL*
meet
,
smiled
with
serenity
as
though
forever
cherished
and
watched
over
*NL*
by
those
they
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
air
in
the
collar
and
cuff
establishment
strangled
her
.
She
knew
*NL*
she
was
gradually
and
surely
shrivelling
in
the
hot
,
stuffy
room
.
The
*NL*
begrimed
windows
rattled
incessantly
from
the
passing
of
elevated
*NL*
trains
.
The
place
was
filled
with
a
whirl
of
noises
and
odors
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
as
she
regarded
some
of
the
grizzled
women
in
the
room
,
*NL*
mere
mechanical
contrivances
sewing
seams
and
grinding
out
,
with
heads
*NL*
bended
over
their
work
,
tales
of
imagined
or
real
girlhood
happiness
,
*NL*
past
drunks
,
the
baby
at
home
,
and
unpaid
wages
.
She
speculated
how
*NL*
long
her
youth
would
endure
.
She
began
to
see
the
bloom
upon
her
*NL*
cheeks
as
valuable
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
imagined
herself
,
in
an
exasperating
future
,
as
a
scrawny
woman
*NL*
with
an
eternal
grievance
.
Too
,
she
thought
Pete
to
be
a
very
*NL*
fastidious
person
concerning
the
appearance
of
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
she
would
love
to
see
somebody
entangle
their
fingers
in
the
*NL*
oily
beard
of
the
fat
foreigner
who
owned
the
establishment
.
He
was
a
*NL*
detestable
creature
.
He
wore
white
socks
with
low
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sat
all
day
delivering
orations
,
in
the
depths
of
a
cushioned
chair
.
*NL*
His
pocketbook
deprived
them
of
the
power
to
retort
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
Maggie
was
anxious
for
a
friend
to
whom
she
could
talk
about
*NL*
Pete
.
She
would
have
liked
to
discuss
his
admirable
mannerisms
with
a
*NL*
reliable
mutual
friend
.
At
home
,
she
found
her
mother
often
drunk
and
*NL*
always
raving
.
It
seems
that
the
world
had
treated
this
woman
very
*NL*
badly
,
and
she
took
a
deep
revenge
upon
such
portions
of
it
as
came
*NL*
within
her
reach
.
She
broke
furniture
as
if
she
were
at
last
getting
her
*NL*
rights
.
She
swelled
with
virtuous
indignation
as
she
carried
the
lighter
*NL*
articles
of
household
use
,
one
by
one
under
the
shadows
of
the
three
*NL*
gilt
balls
,
where
Hebrews
chained
them
with
chains
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
came
when
he
was
obliged
to
by
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
*NL*
control
.
His
well-trained
legs
brought
him
staggering
home
and
put
him
*NL*
to
bed
some
nights
when
he
would
rather
have
gone
elsewhere
.
Swaggering
*NL*
Pete
loomed
like
a
golden
sun
to
Maggie
.
He
took
her
to
a
dime
museum
*NL*
where
rows
of
meek
freaks
astonished
her
.
She
contemplated
their
*NL*
deformities
with
awe
and
thought
them
a
sort
of
chosen
tribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

very
*NL*
badly
,
and
she
took
a
deep
revenge
upon
such
portions
of
it
as
came
*NL*
within
her
reach
.
She
broke
furniture
as
if
she
were
at
last
getting
her
*NL*
rights
.
She
swelled
with
virtuous
indignation
as
she
carried
the
lighter
*NL*
articles
of
household
use
,
one
by
one
under
the
shadows
of
the
three
*NL*
gilt
balls
,
where
Hebrews
chained
them
with
chains
of
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
came
when
he
was
obliged
to
by
circumstances
over
which
he
had
no
*NL*
control
.
His
well-trained
legs
brought
him
staggering
home
and
put
him
*NL*
to
bed
some
nights
when
he
would
rather
have
gone
elsewhere
.
Swaggering
*NL*
Pete
loomed
like
a
golden
sun
to
Maggie
.
He
took
her
to
a
dime
museum
*NL*
where
rows
of
meek
freaks
astonished
her
.
She
contemplated
their
*NL*
deformities
with
awe
and
thought
them
a
sort
of
chosen
tribe
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
,
raking
his
brains
for
amusement
,
discovered
the
Central
Park
*NL*
Menagerie
and
the
Museum
of
Arts
.
Sunday
afternoons
would
sometimes
find
*NL*
them
at
these
places
.
Pete
did
not
appear
to
be
particularly
interested
*NL*
in
what
he
saw
.
He
stood
around
looking
heavy
,
while
Maggie
giggled
in
*NL*
glee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
at
the
Menagerie
he
went
into
a
trance
of
admiration
before
the
*NL*
spectacle
of
a
very
small
monkey
threatening
to
thrash
a
cageful
because
*NL*
one
of
them
had
pulled
his
tail
and
he
had
not
wheeled
about
quickly
*NL*
enough
to
discover
who
did
it
.
Ever
after
Pete
knew
that
monkey
by
sight
*NL*
and
winked
at
him
,
trying
to
induce
hime
to
fight
with
other
and
larger
*NL*
monkeys
.
At
the
Museum
,
Maggie
said
,
``
Dis
is
outa
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
hell
,
''
said
Pete
,
``
wait
'till
next
summer
an
'
I
'll
take
yehs
to
a
*NL*
picnic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
girl
wandered
in
the
vaulted
rooms
,
Pete
occupied
himself
in
*NL*
returning
stony
stare
for
stony
stare
,
the
appalling
scrutiny
of
the
*NL*
watch-dogs
of
the
treasures
.
Occasionally
he
would
remark
in
loud
tones
:
*NL*
``
Dat
jay
has
got
glass
eyes
,
''
and
sentences
of
the
sort
.
When
he
tired
*NL*
of
this
amusement
he
would
go
to
the
mummies
and
moralize
over
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Usually
he
submitted
with
silent
dignity
to
all
which
he
had
to
go
*NL*
through
,
but
,
at
times
,
he
was
goaded
into
comment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
,
''
he
demanded
once
.
``
Look
at
all
dese
little
jugs
!
*NL*
Hundred
jugs
in
a
row
!
Ten
rows
in
a
case
an
'
`
bout
a
t
`
ousand

!
*NL*
What
deh
blazes
use
is

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Evenings
during
the
week
he
took
her
to
see
plays
in
which
the
*NL*
brain-clutching
heroine
was
rescued
from
the
palatial
home
of
her
*NL*
guardian
,
who
is
cruelly
after
her
bonds
,
by
the
hero
with
the
*NL*
beautiful
sentiments
.
The
latter
spent
most
of
his
time
out
at
soak
in
*NL*
pale-green
snow
storms
,
busy
with
a
nickel-plated
revolver
,
rescuing
*NL*
aged
strangers
from
villains
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
lost
herself
in
sympathy
with
the
wanderers
swooning
in
snow
*NL*
storms
beneath
happy-hued
church
windows
.
And
a
choir
within
singing
*NL*
``
Joy
to
the
World
.
''
To
Maggie
and
the
rest
of
the
audience
this
was
*NL*
transcendental
realism
.
Joy
always
within
,
and
they
,
like
the
actor
,
*NL*
inevitably
without
.
Viewing
it
,
they
hugged
themselves
in
ecstatic
*NL*
pity
of
their
imagined
or
real
condition
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
thought
the
arrogance
and
granite-heartedness
of
the
magnate
*NL*
of
the
play
was
very
accurately
drawn
.
She
echoed
the
maledictions
*NL*
that
the
occupants
of
the
gallery
showered
on
this
individual
when
his
*NL*
lines
compelled
him
to
expose
his
extreme
selfishness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shady
persons
in
the
audience
revolted
from
the
pictured
villainy
of
*NL*
the
drama
.
With
untiring
zeal
they
hissed
vice
and
applauded
virtue
.
*NL*
Unmistakably
bad
men
evinced
an
apparently
sincere
admiration
for
*NL*
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loud
gallery
was
overwhelmingly
with
the
unfortunate
and
the
*NL*
oppressed
.
They
encouraged
the
struggling
hero
with
cries
,
and
jeered
*NL*
the
villain
,
hooting
and
calling
attention
to
his
whiskers
.
When
*NL*
anybody
died
in
the
pale-green
snow
storms
,
the
gallery
mourned
.
They
*NL*
sought
out
the
painted
misery
and
hugged
it
as
akin
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hero
's
erratic
march
from
poverty
in
the
first
act
,
to
wealth
*NL*
and
triumph
in
the
final
one
,
in
which
he
forgives
all
the
enemies
that
*NL*
he
has
left
,
he
was
assisted
by
the
gallery
,
which
applauded
his
*NL*
generous
and
noble
sentiments
and
confounded
the
speeches
of
his
*NL*
opponents
by
making
irrelevant
but
very
sharp
remarks
.
Those
actors
*NL*
who
were
cursed
with
villainy
parts
were
confronted
at
every
turn
by
*NL*
the
gallery
.
If
one
of
them
rendered
lines
containing
the
most
subtile
*NL*
distinctions
between
right
and
wrong
,
the
gallery
was
immediately
aware
*NL*
if
the
actor
meant
wickedness
,
and
denounced
him
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
act
was
a
triumph
for
the
hero
,
poor
and
of
the
masses
,
the
*NL*
representative
of
the
audience
,
over
the
villain
and
the
rich
man
,
his
*NL*
pockets
stuffed
with
bonds
,
his
heart
packed
with
tyrannical
purposes
,
*NL*
imperturbable
amid
suffering
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
always
departed
with
raised
spirits
from
the
showing
places
of
*NL*
the
melodrama
.
She
rejoiced
at
the
way
in
which
the
poor
and
virtuous
*NL*
eventually
surmounted
the
wealthy
and
wicked
.
The
theatre
made
her
*NL*
think
.
She
wondered
if
the
culture
and
refinement
she
had
seen
*NL*
imitated
,
perhaps
grotesquely
,
by
the
heroine
on
the
stage
,
could
be
*NL*
acquired
by
a
girl
who
lived
in
a
tenement
house
and
worked
in
a
shirt
*NL*
factory
.

Chapter
IX
*NL*
*NL*
A
group
of
urchins
were
intent
upon
the
side
door
of
a
saloon
.
*NL*
Expectancy
gleamed
from
their
eyes
.
They
were
twisting
their
fingers
*NL*
in
excitement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
she
comes
,
''
yelled
one
of
them
suddenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
group
of
urchins
burst
instantly
asunder
and
its
individual
*NL*
fragments
were
spread
in
a
wide
,
respectable
half
circle
about
the
*NL*
point
of
interest
.
The
saloon
door
opened
with
a
crash
,
and
the
figure
*NL*
of
a
woman
appeared
upon
the
threshold
.
Her
grey
hair
fell
in
knotted
*NL*
masses
about
her
shoulders
.
Her
face
was
crimsoned
and
wet
with
*NL*
perspiration
.
Her
eyes
had
a
rolling
glare
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
damn
cent
more
of
me
money
will
yehs
ever
get
,
not
a

*NL*

*NL*
Disturbance

!
T'hell

Johnnie
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
received
a
kick
of
exasperation
from
within
and
the
woman
*NL*
lurched
heavily
out
on
the
sidewalk
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
gamins
in
the
half-circle
became
violently
agitated
.
They
began
to
*NL*
dance
about
and
hoot
and
yell
and
jeer
.
Wide
dirty
grins
spread
over
*NL*
each
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
made
a
furious
dash
at
a
particularly
outrageous
cluster
of
*NL*
little
boys
.
They
laughed
delightedly
and
scampered
off
a
short
*NL*
distance
,
calling
out
over
their
shoulders
to
her
.
She
stood
tottering
*NL*
on
the
curb-stone
and
thundered
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
devil
's
kids
,
''
she
howled
,
shaking
red
fists
.
The
little
boys
*NL*
whooped
in
glee
.
As
she
started
up
the
street
they
fell
in
behind
and
*NL*
marched
uproariously
.
Occasionally
she
wheeled
about
and
made
charges
*NL*
on
them
.
They
ran
nimbly
out
of
reach
and
taunted
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
frame
of
a
gruesome
doorway
she
stood
for
a
moment
cursing
them
.
*NL*
Her
hair
straggled
,
giving
her
crimson
features
a
look
of
insanity
.
*NL*
Her
great
fists
quivered
as
she
shook
them
madly
in
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
urchins
made
terrific
noises
until
she
turned
and
disappeared
.
*NL*
Then
they
filed
quietly
in
the
way
they
had
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
floundered
about
in
the
lower
hall
of
the
tenement
house
and
*NL*
finally
stumbled
up
the
stairs
.
On
an
upper
hall
a
door
was
opened
and
*NL*
a
collection
of
heads
peered
curiously
out
,
watching
her
.
With
a
*NL*
wrathful
snort
the
woman
confronted
the
door
,
but
it
was
slammed
*NL*
hastily
in
her
face
and
the
key
was
turned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
for
a
few
minutes
,
delivering
a
frenzied
challenge
at
the
*NL*
panels
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
in
deh
hall
,
Mary
Murphy
,
damn
yeh

want
a
row
.
Come
*NL*
ahn
,
yeh
overgrown
terrier
,
come
ahn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
kick
the
door
with
her
great
feet
.
She
shrilly
defied
the
*NL*
universe
to
appear
and
do
battle
.
Her
cursing
trebles
brought
heads
*NL*
from
all
doors
save
the
one
she
threatened
.
Her
eyes
glared
in
every
*NL*
direction
.
The
air
was
full
of
her
tossing
fists
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
ahn
,
deh
hull
damn
gang
of
yehs
,
come
ahn
,
''
she
roared
at
the
*NL*
spectators
.
An
oath
or
two
,
cat-calls
,
jeers
and
bits
of
facetious
*NL*
advice
were
given
in
reply
.
Missiles
clattered
about
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
's
deh
matter
wid
yeh
?
''
said
a
voice
in
the
gathered
*NL*
gloom
,
and
Jimmie
came
forward
.
He
carried
a
tin
dinner-pail
in
his
*NL*
hand
and
under
his
arm
a
brown
truckman
's
apron
done
in
a
bundle
.
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
's
wrong
?
''
he
demanded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
,
all
of

''
his
mother
was
howling
.
``
Come

'll
stamp

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shet
yer

,
an
'
come
home
,
yeh
damned
old
fool
,
''
roared
Jimmie
at
*NL*
her
.
She
strided
up
to
him
and
twirled
her
fingers
in
his
face
.
Her
*NL*
eyes
were
darting
flames
of
unreasoning
rage
and
her
frame
trembled
*NL*
with
eagerness
for
a
fight
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
T'hell

An

''
she
bawled
at
him
.
She
turned
her
huge
back
in
*NL*
tremendous
disdain
and
climbed
the
stairs
to
the
next
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
followed
,
cursing
blackly
.
At
the
top
of
the
flight
he
seized
*NL*
his
mother
's
arm
and
started
to
drag
her
toward
the
door
of
their
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
home
,
damn
yeh
,
''
he
gritted
between
his
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Take
yer
hands
off
me
!
Take
yer
hands
off
me
,
''
shrieked
his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
raised
her
arm
and
whirled
her
great
fist
at
her
son
's
face
.
*NL*
Jimmie
dodged
his
head
and
the
blow
struck
him
in
the
back
of
the
neck
.
*NL*
``
Damn
yeh
,
''
gritted
he
again
.
He
threw
out
his
left
hand
and
writhed
*NL*
his
fingers
about
her
middle
arm
.
The
mother
and
the
son
began
to
sway
*NL*
and
struggle
like
gladiators
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoop
!
''
said
the
Rum
Alley
tenement
house
.
The
hall
filled
with
*NL*
interested
spectators
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,
ol'
lady
,
dat
was
a
dandy

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
T'ree

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
stop

damn
scrappin

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
of
the
Johnson
home
opened
and
Maggie
looked
out
.
Jimmie
made
*NL*
a
supreme
cursing
effort
and
hurled
his
mother
into
the
room
.
He
*NL*
quickly
followed
and
closed
the
door
.
The
Rum
Alley
tenement
swore
*NL*
disappointedly
and
retired
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
slowly
gathered
herself
up
from
the
floor
.
Her
eyes
*NL*
glittered
menacingly
upon
her
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
now
,
''
said
Jimmie
,
``
we
've
had
enough
of
dis
.
Sit
down
,
an
'
don
'
*NL*
make
no
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
grasped
her
arm
,
and
twisting
it
,
forced
her
into
a
creaking
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
yer
hands
off
me
,
''
roared
his
mother
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
yer
ol'
hide
,
''
yelled
Jimmie
,
madly
.
Maggie
shrieked
and
ran
*NL*
into
the
other
room
.
To
her
there
came
the
sound
of
a
storm
of
crashes
*NL*
and
curses
.
There
was
a
great
final
thump
and
Jimmie
's
voice
cried
:
*NL*
``
Dere
,
damn
yeh
,
stay
still
.
''
Maggie
opened
the
door
now
,
and
went
*NL*
warily
out
.
``
Oh
,
Jimmie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
leaning
against
the
wall
and
swearing
.
Blood
stood
upon
bruises
*NL*
on
his
knotty
fore-arms
where
they
had
scraped
against
the
floor
or
the
*NL*
walls
in
the
scuffle
.
The
mother
lay
screeching
on
the
floor
,
the
*NL*
tears
running
down
her
furrowed
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
,
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
gazed
about
her
.
The
usual
*NL*
upheaval
of
the
tables
and
chairs
had
taken
place
.
Crockery
was
strewn
*NL*
broadcast
in
fragments
.
The
stove
had
been
disturbed
on
its
legs
,
and
*NL*
now
leaned
idiotically
to
one
side
.
A
pail
had
been
upset
and
water
*NL*
spread
in
all
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
opened
and
Pete
appeared
.
He
shrugged
his
shoulders
.
``
Oh
,
*NL*
Gawd
,
''
he
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
walked
over
to
Maggie
and
whispered
in
her
ear
.
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
,
*NL*
Mag

The
mother
in
the
corner
upreared
her
head
and
shook
her
tangled
locks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
said
,
glowering
at
her
daughter
in
the
*NL*
gloom
.
Her
eyes
seemed
to
burn
balefully
.

The

began
to
tremble

*NL*
At
this
instant
Pete
came
forward
.
``
Oh

softly
in

*NL*
The
woman
on
the
floor
cursed
.
Jimmie
was
intent
upon
his
bruised
*NL*
fore-arms
.
The
girl
cast
a
glance
about
the
room
filled
with
a
chaotic
*NL*
mass
of
debris
,
and
at
the
red

writhing

of

Chapter
X
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
had
an
idea
it
was
n't
common
courtesy
for
a
friend
to
come
to
*NL*
one
's
home
and
ruin
one
's
sister
.
But
he
was
not
sure
how
much
Pete
*NL*
knew
about
the
rules
of
politeness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
following
night
he
returned
home
from
work
at
rather
a
late
hour
in
*NL*
the
evening
.
In
passing
through
the
halls
he
came
upon
the
gnarled
and
*NL*
leathery
old
woman
who
possessed
the
music
box
.
She
was
grinning
in
*NL*
the
dim
light
that
drifted
through
dust-stained
panes
.
She
beckoned
to
*NL*
him
with
a
smudged
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
Jimmie
,
what
do

`

I
got

'
night
.
It
was

*NL*
funnies
'
t
`
ing

ever

''
she
cried
,
coming
close
to
him
and
leering
.
*NL*
She
was
trembling
with
eagerness
to
tell
her
tale
.
``
I
was
by

when
yer

An

*NL*
*NL*
Storm-clouds
swept
over
Jimmie
's
face
,
but
he
turned
from
the
leathery
*NL*
old
woman
and
plodded
on
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hell
,
yes
,
''
called
she
after
him
.
She
laughed
a
laugh
that
was
*NL*
like
a
prophetic
croak
.
''
`
Oh
,
hell
,
yes

he

Oh

*NL*
There
was
no
one
in
at
home
.
The
rooms
showed
that
attempts
had
been
*NL*
made
at
tidying
them
.
Parts
of
the
wreckage
of
the
day
before
had
been
*NL*
repaired
by
an
unskilful
hand
.
A
chair
or
two
and
the
table
,
stood
*NL*
uncertainly
upon
legs
.
The
floor
had
been
newly
swept
.
Too
,
the
blue
*NL*
ribbons
had
been
restored
to
the
curtains
,
and
the
lambrequin
,
with
its
*NL*
immense
sheaves
of
yellow
wheat
and
red
roses
of
equal
size
,
had
been
*NL*
returned
,
in
a
worn
and
sorry
state
,
to
its
position
at
the
mantel
.
*NL*
Maggie
's
jacket
and
hat
were
gone
from
the
nail
behind
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
walked
to
the
window
and
began
to
look
through
the
blurred
*NL*
glass
.
It
occurred
to
him
to
vaguely
wonder
,
for
an
instant
,
if
some
*NL*
of
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
had
brothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
,
however
,
he
began
to
swear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
was
me
frien
'
!
I
brought
`
im
here
!
Dat
's
deh
hell
of
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fumed
about
the
room
,
his
anger
gradually
rising
to
the
furious
*NL*
pitch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
kill

Dat
's
what
I
'll
do

I
'll

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clutched
his
hat
and
sprang
toward
the
door
.
But
it
opened
and
his
*NL*
mother
's
great
form
blocked
the
passage
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
's
deh
matter
wid
yeh
?
''
exclaimed
she
,
coming
into
the
*NL*
rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
gave
vent
to
a
sardonic
curse
and
then
laughed
heavily
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Maggie
's
gone
teh
deh
devil
!
Dat
's
what
!
See

*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh

his
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

roared
Jimmie
,
*NL*
impatiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deh

''
murmured
the
mother
,
astounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
grunted
,
and
then
began
to
stare
out
at
the
window
.
His
mother
*NL*
sat
down
in
a
chair
,
but
a
moment
later
sprang
erect
and
delivered
a
*NL*
maddened
whirl
of
oaths
.
Her
son
turned
to
look
at
her
as
she
reeled
*NL*
and
swayed
in
the
middle
of
the
room
,
her
fierce
face
convulsed
with
*NL*
passion
,
her
blotched
arms
raised
high
in
imprecation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
Gawd
curse

forever

''
she
shrieked
.
``

``

said
her
son
.
``
Take

*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
raised
lamenting
eyes
to
the
ceiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
deh

she
whispered
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
The
tears
rolled
down
her
furrowed
face

Her
hands
trembled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
He
was
trying
to
formulate
a
theory
that
he
had
always
unconsciously
*NL*
held
,
that
all
sisters
,
excepting
his
own
,
could
advisedly
be
ruined
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
suddenly
broke
out
again

*NL*
*NL*
In
a
fury
he
plunged
out
of
the
doorway
.
As
he
vanished
the
mother
*NL*
raised
her
head
and
lifted
both
hands
,
entreating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
Gawd
curse

she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
darkness
of
the
hallway
Jimmie
discerned
a
knot
of
women
talking
*NL*
volubly
.
When
he
strode
by
they
paid
no
attention
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She

he
heard
one

``

a

in

key
of

triumph

Chapter
XI
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
corner
a
glass-fronted
building
shed
a
yellow
glare
upon
the
*NL*
pavements
.
The
open
mouth
of
a
saloon
called
seductively
to
passengers
*NL*
to
enter
and
annihilate
sorrow
or
create
rage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
interior
of
the
place
was
papered
in
olive
and
bronze
tints
of
*NL*
imitation
leather
.
A
shining
bar
of
counterfeit
massiveness
extended
*NL*
down
the
side
of
the
room
.
Behind
it
a
great
mahogany-appearing
*NL*
sideboard
reached
the
ceiling
.
Upon
its
shelves
rested
pyramids
of
*NL*
shimmering
glasses
that
were
never
disturbed
.
Mirrors
set
in
the
face
*NL*
of
the
sideboard
multiplied
them
.
Lemons
,
oranges
and
paper
napkins
,
*NL*
arranged
with
mathematical
precision
,
sat
among
the
glasses
.
Many-hued
*NL*
decanters
of
liquor
perched
at
regular
intervals
on
the
lower
shelves
.
*NL*
A
nickel-plated
cash
register
occupied
a
position
in
the
exact
centre
*NL*
of
the
general
effect
.
The
elementary
senses
of
it
all
seemed
to
be
*NL*
opulence
and
geometrical
accuracy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
from
the
bar
a
smaller
counter
held
a
collection
of
plates
upon
*NL*
which
swarmed
frayed
fragments
of
crackers
,
slices
of
boiled
ham
,
*NL*
dishevelled
bits
of
cheese
,
and
pickles
swimming
in
vinegar
.
An
odor
*NL*
of
grasping
,
begrimed
hands
and
munching
mouths
pervaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
,
in
a
white
jacket
,
was
behind
the
bar
bending
expectantly
toward
*NL*
a
quiet
stranger
.
``
A
beeh
,
''
said
the
man
.
Pete
drew
a
foam-topped
*NL*
glassful
and
set
it
dripping
upon
the
bar
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
moment
the
light
bamboo
doors
at
the
entrance
swung
open
and
*NL*
crashed
against
the
siding
.
Jimmie
and
a
companion
entered
.
They
*NL*
swaggered
unsteadily
but
belligerently
toward
the
bar
and
looked
at
*NL*
Pete
with
bleared
and
blinking
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gin
,
''
said
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gin
,
''
said
the
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
slid
a
bottle
and
two
glasses
along
the
bar
.
He
bended
his
head
*NL*
sideways
as
he
assiduously
polished
away
with
a
napkin
at
the
gleaming
*NL*
wood
.
He
had
a
look
of
watchfulness
upon
his
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
and
his
companion
kept
their
eyes
upon
the
bartender
and
*NL*
conversed
loudly
in
tones
of
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
dindy
masher
,
ai
n't
he
,
by
Gawd
?
''
laughed
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hell
,
yes
,
''
said
the
companion
,
sneering
widely
.
``
He
's
great
,
he
*NL*
is
.
Git
onto
deh
mug
on
deh
blokie
.
Dat
's
enough
to
make
a
feller
*NL*
turn
hand-springs
in
`
is
sleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
quiet
stranger
moved
himself
and
his
glass
a
trifle
further
away
*NL*
and
maintained
an
attitude
of
oblivion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gee
!
ai
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hey
,
''
cried
Jimmie
,
in
tones
of
command
.
Pete
came
along
slowly
,
with
*NL*
a
sullen
dropping
of
the
under
lip
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
growled
,
``
what
's
eatin
'
yehs

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gin
,
''
said
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gin
,
''
said
the
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Pete
confronted
them
with
the
bottle
and
the
glasses
,
they
laughed
*NL*
in
his
face
.
Jimmie
's
companion
,
evidently
overcome
with
merriment
,
*NL*
pointed
a
grimy
forefinger
in
Pete
's
direction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
Jimmie
,
''
demanded
he
,
``
what
deh
hell
is
dat
behind
deh
bar
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damned
if
I
knows
,
''
replied
Jimmie
.
They
laughed
loudly
.
Pete
put
*NL*
down
a
bottle
with
a
bang
and
turned
a
formidable
face
toward
them
.
He
*NL*
disclosed
his
teeth
and
his
shoulders
heaved
restlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
fellers
ca
n't

''
he
said
.
``
Drink
yer
stuff

'

'
*NL*

'
make
no

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
the
laughter
faded
from
the
faces
of
the
two
men
and
*NL*
expressions
of
offended
dignity
immediately
came
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
deh
hell
has
said
anyt
`
ing
teh
you
,
''
cried
they
in
the
same
breath
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quiet
stranger
looked
at
the
door
calculatingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
come
off
,
''
said
Pete
to
the
two
men
.
``
Do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

airily
cried
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

airily
repeated
his
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
continued
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Pete
in
a
threatening
voice
,
``
don
'
make
no
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
suddenly
leaned
forward
with
his
head
on
one
side
.
He
snarled
*NL*
like
a
wild
animal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
if
we
does
?
See
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dark
blood
flushed
into
Pete
's
face
,
and
he
shot
a
lurid
glance
at
*NL*
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
den
we
'll
see
whose
deh
bes
'
man

''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quiet
stranger
moved
modestly
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
began
to
swell
with
valor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Don

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure

responded
his
companion
in
tones
of
conviction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

''
said
Pete
,
easily
.
``
Go

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
again
began
to
laugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What

''
cried
the
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damned

replied
Jimmie
with
exaggerated
contempt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
made
a
furious
gesture
.
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hell
,
''
cried
the
two
men
in
chorus
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
glare
of
a
panther
came
into
Pete
's
eyes
.
``
Dat
's
what
I
said
!
*NL*
Unnerstan
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
through
a
passage
at
the
end
of
the
bar
and
swelled
down
upon
*NL*
the
two
men
.
They
stepped
promptly
forward
and
crowded
close
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
bristled
like
three
roosters
.
They
moved
their
heads
pugnaciously
*NL*
and
kept
their
shoulders
braced
.
The
nervous
muscles
about
each
mouth
*NL*
twitched
with
a
forced
smile
of
mockery
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
deh
hell
yer
goin
'
teh
do
?
''
gritted
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
stepped
warily
back
,
waving
his
hands
before
him
to
keep
the
men
*NL*
from
coming
too
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
deh
hell
yer
goin
'
teh
do
?
''
repeated
Jimmie
's
ally
.
They
*NL*
kept
close
to
him
,
taunting
and
leering
.
They
strove
to
make
him
*NL*
attempt
the
initial
blow
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Keep
back
,
now
!
Don
'
crowd
me
,
''
ominously
said
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
they
chorused
in
contempt
.
``
Oh
,
hell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
small
,
tossing
group
,
the
three
men
edged
for
positions
like
*NL*
frigates
contemplating
battle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
why
deh
hell
don
'
yeh
try
teh
t
`
row
us
out
?
''
cried
Jimmie
and
*NL*
his
ally
with
copious
sneers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bravery
of
bull-dogs
sat
upon
the
faces
of
the
men
.
Their
clenched
*NL*
fists
moved
like
eager
weapons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
allied
two
jostled
the
bartender
's
elbows
,
glaring
at
him
with
*NL*
feverish
eyes
and
forcing
him
toward
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
Pete
swore
redly
.
The
flash
of
action
gleamed
from
his
eyes
.
*NL*
He
threw
back
his
arm
and
aimed
a
tremendous
,
lightning-like
blow
at
*NL*
Jimmie
's
face
.
His
foot
swung
a
step
forward
and
the
weight
of
his
*NL*
body
was
behind
his
fist
.
Jimmie
ducked
his
head
,
Bowery-like
,
with
*NL*
the
quickness
of
a
cat
.
The
fierce
,
answering
blows
of
him
and
his
*NL*
ally
crushed
on
Pete
's
bowed
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quiet
stranger
vanished
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
arms
of
the
combatants
whirled
in
the
air
like
flails
.
The
faces
*NL*
of
the
men
,
at
first
flushed
to
flame-colored
anger
,
now
began
to
fade
*NL*
to
the
pallor
of
warriors
in
the
blood
and
heat
of
a
battle
.
Their
*NL*
lips
curled
back
and
stretched
tightly
over
the
gums
in
ghoul-like
*NL*
grins
.
Through
their
white
,
gripped
teeth
struggled
hoarse
whisperings
*NL*
of
oaths
.
Their
eyes
glittered
with
murderous
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Each
head
was
huddled
between
its
owner
's
shoulders
,
and
arms
were
*NL*
swinging
with
marvelous
rapidity
.
Feet
scraped
to
and
fro
with
a
loud
*NL*
scratching
sound
upon
the
sanded
floor
.
Blows
left
crimson
blotches
*NL*
upon
pale
skin
.
The
curses
of
the
first
quarter
minute
of
the
fight
*NL*
died
away
.
The
breaths
of
the
fighters
came
wheezingly
from
their
lips
*NL*
and
the
three
chests
were
straining
and
heaving
.
Pete
at
intervals
*NL*
gave
vent
to
low
,
labored
hisses
,
that
sounded
like
a
desire
to
kill
.
*NL*
Jimmie
's
ally
gibbered
at
times
like
a
wounded
maniac
.
Jimmie
was
*NL*
silent
,
fighting
with
the
face
of
a
sacrificial
priest
.
The
rage
of
*NL*
fear
shone
in
all
their
eyes
and
their
blood-colored
fists
swirled
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
a
tottering
moment
a
blow
from
Pete
's
hand
struck
the
ally
and
he
*NL*
crashed
to
the
floor
.
He
wriggled
instantly
to
his
feet
and
grasping
*NL*
the
quiet
stranger
's
beer
glass
from
the
bar
,
hurled
it
at
Pete
's
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
High
on
the
wall
it
burst
like
a
bomb
,
shivering
fragments
flying
in
*NL*
all
directions
.
Then
missiles
came
to
every
man
's
hand
.
The
place
had
*NL*
heretofore
appeared
free
of
things
to
throw
,
but
suddenly
glass
and
*NL*
bottles
went
singing
through
the
air
.
They
were
thrown
point
blank
at
*NL*
bobbing
heads
.
The
pyramid
of
shimmering
glasses
,
that
had
never
been
*NL*
disturbed
,
changed
to
cascades
as
heavy
bottles
were
flung
into
them
.
*NL*
Mirrors
splintered
to
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
three
frothing
creatures
on
the
floor
buried
themselves
in
a
frenzy
*NL*
for
blood
.
There
followed
in
the
wake
of
missiles
and
fists
some
*NL*
unknown
prayers
,
perhaps
for
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
quiet
stranger
had
sprawled
very
pyrotechnically
out
on
the
*NL*
sidewalk
.
A
laugh
ran
up
and
down
the
avenue
for
the
half
of
a
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dey
've
trowed
a
bloke
inteh
deh
street
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
People
heard
the
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
shuffling
feet
within
the
*NL*
saloon
and
came
running
.
A
small
group
,
bending
down
to
look
under
the
*NL*
bamboo
doors
,
watching
the
fall
of
glass
,
and
three
pairs
of
violent
*NL*
legs
,
changed
in
a
moment
to
a
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
policeman
came
charging
down
the
sidewalk
and
bounced
through
the
*NL*
doors
into
the
saloon
.
The
crowd
bended
and
surged
in
absorbing
*NL*
anxiety
to
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
caught
first
sight
of
the
on-coming
interruption
.
On
his
feet
*NL*
he
had
the
same
regard
for
a
policeman
that
,
when
on
his
truck
,
he
had
*NL*
for
a
fire
engine
.
He
howled
and
ran
for
the
side
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
officer
made
a
terrific
advance
,
club
in
hand
.
One
comprehensive
*NL*
sweep
of
the
long
night
stick
threw
the
ally
to
the
floor
and
forced
*NL*
Pete
to
a
corner
.
With
his
disengaged
hand
he
made
a
furious
effort
at
*NL*
Jimmie
's
coat-tails
.
Then
he
regained
his
balance
and
paused
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
you
are
a
pair
of
pictures
.
What
in
hell
yeh
been
up
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
,
with
his
face
drenched
in
blood
,
escaped
up
a
side
street
,
*NL*
pursued
a
short
distance
by
some
of
the
more
law-loving
,
or
excited
*NL*
individuals
of
the
crowd
.
*NL*
*NL*
Later
,
from
a
corner
safely
dark
,
he
saw
the
policeman
,
the
ally
and
*NL*
the
bartender
emerge
from
the
saloon
.
Pete
locked
the
doors
and
then
*NL*
followed
up
the
avenue
in
the
rear
of
the
crowd-encompassed
policeman
*NL*
and
his
charge
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
first
thoughts
Jimmie
,
with
his
heart
throbbing
at
battle
heat
,
*NL*
started
to
go
desperately
to
the
rescue
of
his
friend
,
but
he
halted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
deh
hell
?
''
he
demanded
of
himself
.

Chapter
XII
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
hall
of
irregular
shape
sat
Pete
and
Maggie
drinking
beer
.
A
*NL*
submissive
orchestra
dictated
to
by
a
spectacled
man
with
frowsy
hair
*NL*
and
a
dress
suit
,
industriously
followed
the
bobs
of
his
head
and
the
*NL*
waves
of
his
baton
.
A
ballad
singer
,
in
a
dress
of
flaming
scarlet
,
*NL*
sang
in
the
inevitable
voice
of
brass
.
When
she
vanished
,
men
seated
*NL*
at
the
tables
near
the
front
applauded
loudly
,
pounding
the
polished
*NL*
wood
with
their
beer
glasses
.
She
returned
attired
in
less
gown
,
and
*NL*
sang
again
.
She
received
another
enthusiastic
encore
.
She
reappeared
*NL*
in
still
less
gown
and
danced
.
The
deafening
rumble
of
glasses
and
*NL*
clapping
of
hands
that
followed
her
exit
indicated
an
overwhelming
*NL*
desire
to
have
her
come
on
for
the
fourth
time
,
but
the
curiosity
of
*NL*
the
audience
was
not
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
pale
.
From
her
eyes
had
been
plucked
all
look
of
*NL*
self-reliance
.
She
leaned
with
a
dependent
air
toward
her
companion
.
*NL*
She
was
timid
,
as
if
fearing
his
anger
or
displeasure
.
She
seemed
to
*NL*
beseech
tenderness
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
's
air
of
distinguished
valor
had
grown
upon
him
until
it
*NL*
threatened
stupendous
dimensions
.
He
was
infinitely
gracious
to
the
*NL*
girl
.
It
was
apparent
to
her
that
his
condescension
was
a
marvel
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
appear
to
strut
even
while
sitting
still
and
he
showed
that
he
*NL*
was
a
lion
of
lordly
characteristics
by
the
air
with
which
he
spat
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
Maggie
gazing
at
him
wonderingly
,
he
took
pride
in
commanding
the
*NL*
waiters
who
were
,
however
,
indifferent
or
deaf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hi
,
you
,
git
a
russle
on
yehs
!
What
deh
hell
yehs
lookin
'
at
?
Two
*NL*
more
beehs
,
d'yeh
hear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
leaned
back
and
critically
regarded
the
person
of
a
girl
with
a
*NL*
straw-colored
wig
who
upon
the
stage
was
flinging
her
heels
in
somewhat
*NL*
awkward
imitation
of
a
well-known
danseuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
Maggie
told
Pete
long
confidential
tales
of
her
former
home
*NL*
life
,
dwelling
upon
the
escapades
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
*NL*
and
the
difficulties
she
had
to
combat
in
order
to
obtain
a
degree
of
*NL*
comfort
.
He
responded
in
tones
of
philanthropy
.
He
pressed
her
arm
*NL*
with
an
air
of
reassuring
proprietorship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dey
was
damn
jays
,
''
he
said
,
denouncing
the
mother
and
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sound
of
the
music
which
,
by
the
efforts
of
the
frowsy-headed
*NL*
leader
,
drifted
to
her
ears
through
the
smoke-filled
atmosphere
,
made
*NL*
the
girl
dream
.
She
thought
of
her
former
Rum
Alley
environment
and
*NL*
turned
to
regard
Pete
's
strong
protecting
fists
.
She
thought
of
the
*NL*
collar
and
cuff
manufactory
and
the
eternal
moan
of
the
proprietor
:
*NL*
``
What
een
hell
do
you
sink
I
pie
fife
dolla
a
week
for
?
Play
?
No
,
py
*NL*

''
She
contemplated
Pete
's
man-subduing
eyes
and
noted
that
wealth
*NL*
and
prosperity
was
indicated
by
his
clothes
.
She
imagined
a
future
,
*NL*
rose-tinted
,
because
of
its
distance
from
all
that
she
previously
had
*NL*
experienced
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
the
present
she
perceived
only
vague
reasons
to
be
miserable
.
*NL*
Her
life
was
Pete
's
and
she
considered
him
worthy
of
the
charge
.
She
*NL*
would
be
disturbed
by
no
particular
apprehensions
,
so
long
as
Pete
*NL*
adored
her
as
he
now
said
he
did
.
She
did
not
feel
like
a
bad
woman
.
*NL*
To
her
knowledge
she
had
never
seen
any
better
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
times
men
at
other
tables
regarded
the
girl
furtively
.
Pete
,
aware
*NL*
of
it
,
nodded
at
her
and
grinned
.
He
felt
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mag
,
yer
a
bloomin
'
good-looker
,
''
he
remarked
,
studying
her
face
*NL*
through
the
haze
.
The
men
made
Maggie
fear
,
but
she
blushed
at
Pete
's
*NL*
words
as
it
became
apparent
to
her
that
she
was
the
apple
of
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grey-headed
men
,
wonderfully
pathetic
in
their
dissipation
,
stared
at
*NL*
her
through
clouds
.
Smooth-cheeked
boys
,
some
of
them
with
faces
of
*NL*
stone
and
mouths
of
sin
,
not
nearly
so
pathetic
as
the
grey
heads
,
*NL*
tried
to
find
the
girl
's
eyes
in
the
smoke
wreaths
.
Maggie
considered
*NL*
she
was
not
what
they
thought
her
.
She
confined
her
glances
to
Pete
*NL*
and
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
orchestra
played
negro
melodies
and
a
versatile
drummer
pounded
,
*NL*
whacked
,
clattered
and
scratched
on
a
dozen
machines
to
make
noise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Those
glances
of
the
men
,
shot
at
Maggie
from
under
half-closed
lids
,
*NL*
made
her
tremble
.
She
thought
them
all
to
be
worse
men
than
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
,
let
's
go
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
went
out
Maggie
perceived
two
women
seated
at
a
table
with
some
*NL*
men
.
They
were
painted
and
their
cheeks
had
lost
their
roundness
.
As
*NL*
she
passed
them
the
girl
,
with
a
shrinking
movement
,
drew
back
her
*NL*
skirts
.

Chapter
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
did
not
return
home
for
a
number
of
days
after
the
fight
with
*NL*
Pete
in
the
saloon
.
When
he
did
,
he
approached
with
extreme
caution
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
found
his
mother
raving
.
Maggie
had
not
returned
home
.
The
parent
*NL*
continually
wondered
how
her
daughter
could
come
to
such
a
pass
.
She
*NL*
had
never
considered
Maggie
as
a
pearl
dropped
unstained
into
Rum
Alley
*NL*
from
Heaven
,
but
she
could
not
conceive
how
it
was
possible
for
her
*NL*
daughter
to
fall
so
low
as
to
bring
disgrace
upon
her
family
.
She
was
*NL*
terrific
in
denunciation
of
the
girl
's
wickedness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
the
neighbors
talked
of
it
,
maddened
her
.
When
women
*NL*
came
in
,
and
in
the
course
of
their
conversation
casually
asked
,
*NL*
``
Where
's
Maggie
dese
days
?
''
the
mother
shook
her
fuzzy
head
at
them
and
*NL*
appalled
them
with
curses
.
Cunning
hints
inviting
confidence
she
*NL*
rebuffed
with
violence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
'
wid
all
deh
bringin
'
up
she
had
,
how
could
she
?
''
moaningly
she
*NL*
asked
of
her
son
.
``
Wid
all
deh
talkin
'
wid
her
I
did
an
'
deh
t
`
ings
I
*NL*
tol
'
her
to
remember
?
When
a
girl
is
bringed
up
deh
way
I
bringed
up
*NL*
Maggie
,
how
kin
she
go
teh
deh
devil
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
was
transfixed
by
these
questions
.
He
could
not
conceive
how
*NL*
under
the
circumstances
his
mother
's
daughter
and
his
sister
could
have
*NL*
been
so
wicked
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
took
a
drink
from
a
squdgy
bottle
that
sat
on
the
table
.
*NL*
She
continued
her
lament
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
had
a
bad
heart
,
dat
girl
did
,
Jimmie
.
She
was
wicked
teh
deh
*NL*
heart
an
'
we
never
knowed
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
nodded
,
admitting
the
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
lived
in
deh
same
house
wid
her
an
'
I
brought
her
up
an
'
we
never
*NL*
knowed
how
bad
she
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
nodded
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wid
a
home
like
dis
an
'
a
mudder
like
me
,
she
went
teh
deh
bad
,
''
cried
*NL*
the
mother
,
raising
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
day
,
Jimmie
came
home
,
sat
down
in
a
chair
and
began
to
wriggle
*NL*
about
with
a
new
and
strange
nervousness
.
At
last
he
spoke
*NL*
shamefacedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
look-a-here
,
dis
t
`
ing
queers
us
!
See
?
We
're

--
maybe
*NL*
it
`
ud

better
if
I
fetched
her
home
an
'
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
started
from
her
chair
and
broke
forth
into
a
storm
of
*NL*
passionate
anger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Let

er

sleep

*NL*
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Sobs
choked
her
and
interrupted
her
reproaches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dere

said
Jimmie
.
``

*NL*
See

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
laughed
a
laugh
that
seemed
to
ring
through
the
city
and
be
*NL*
echoed
and
re-echoed
by
countless
other
laughs
.
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
will

*NL*
wo

Sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
yeh
must
take
me
fer
a

fool

''
said
Jimmie
,
indignant
at
his
*NL*
mother
for
mocking
him
.
``

n't

*NL*
``
Well

I
didn

mean
none

explained
*NL*
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was

damn

said
the
mother
.
``
It
*NL*

gal

anyhow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
dat
,
''
said
Jimmie
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
they
sat
in
silence
.
The
mother
's
eyes
gloated
on
a
scene
*NL*
her
imagination
could
call
before
her
.
Her
lips
were
set
in
a
*NL*
vindictive
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Aye
,
she
'll
cry
,
won
'
she
,
an
'
carry

,
an
'
tell

or

she
ai

an
'
she
wants
to
come
home
agin
,
she
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
grim
humor
,
the
mother
imitated
the
possible
wailing
notes
of
the
*NL*
daughter
's
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Den
I
'll
take
`
er

wo

She

.
*NL*
She
abused
an
'
ill-treated
her
own
mudder
--
her
own
mudder
what
loved
*NL*
her
an
'
she
'll
never
git
anodder
chance
dis
side
of
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
thought
he
had
a
great
idea
of
women
's
frailty
,
but
he
could
not
*NL*
understand
why
any
of
his
kin
should
be
victims
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
her
,
''
he
fervidly
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
Again
he
wondered
vaguely
if
some
of
the
women
of
his
acquaintance
had
*NL*
brothers
.
Nevertheless
,
his
mind
did
not
for
an
instant
confuse
*NL*
himself
with
those
brothers
nor
his
sister
with
theirs
.
After
the
*NL*
mother
had
,
with
great
difficulty
,
suppressed
the
neighbors
,
she
went
*NL*
among
them
and
proclaimed
her
grief
.
``
May
Gawd
forgive
dat
girl
,
''
was
*NL*
her
continual
cry
.
To
attentive
ears
she
recited
the
whole
length
and
*NL*
breadth
of
her
woes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
bringed
`
er
up
deh
way
a
dauter
oughta
be
bringed
up
an
'
dis
is
how
*NL*
she
served
me
!
She
went
teh
deh
devil
deh
first
chance
she
got
!
May
*NL*
Gawd
forgive
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
arrested
for
drunkenness
she
used
the
story
of
her
daughter
's
*NL*
downfall
with
telling
effect
upon
the
police
justices
.
Finally
one
of
*NL*
them
said
to
her
,
peering
down
over
his
spectacles
:
``
Mary
,
the
records
*NL*
of
this
and
other
courts
show
that
you
are
the
mother
of
forty-two
*NL*
daughters
who
have
been
ruined
.
The
case
is
unparalleled
in
the
annals
*NL*
of
this
court
,
and
this
court
thinks
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mother
went
through
life
shedding
large
tears
of
sorrow
.
Her
red
*NL*
face
was
a
picture
of
agony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
course
Jimmie
publicly
damned
his
sister
that
he
might
appear
on
a
*NL*
higher
social
plane
.
But
,
arguing
with
himself
,
stumbling
about
in
*NL*
ways
that
he
knew
not
,
he
,
once
,
almost
came
to
a
conclusion
that
his
*NL*
sister
would
have
been
more
firmly
good
had
she
better
known
why
.
*NL*
However
,
he
felt
that
he
could
not
hold
such
a
view
.
He
threw
it
*NL*
hastily
aside
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Chapter
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
hilarious
hall
there
were
twenty-eight
tables
and
twenty-eight
*NL*
women
and
a
crowd
of
smoking
men
.
Valiant
noise
was
made
on
a
stage
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
hall
by
an
orchestra
composed
of
men
who
looked
as
if
*NL*
they
had
just
happened
in
.
Soiled
waiters
ran
to
and
fro
,
swooping
*NL*
down
like
hawks
on
the
unwary
in
the
throng
;
clattering
along
the
*NL*
aisles
with
trays
covered
with
glasses
;
stumbling
over
women
's
skirts
*NL*
and
charging
two
prices
for
everything
but
beer
,
all
with
a
swiftness
*NL*
that
blurred
the
view
of
the
cocoanut
palms
and
dusty
monstrosities
*NL*
painted
upon
the
walls
of
the
room
.
A
bouncer
,
with
an
immense
load
of
*NL*
business
upon
his
hands
,
plunged
about
in
the
crowd
,
dragging
bashful
*NL*
strangers
to
prominent
chairs
,
ordering
waiters
here
and
there
and
*NL*
quarreling
furiously
with
men
who
wanted
to
sing
with
the
orchestra
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
usual
smoke
cloud
was
present
,
but
so
dense
that
heads
and
arms
*NL*
seemed
entangled
in
it
.
The
rumble
of
conversation
was
replaced
by
a
*NL*
roar
.
Plenteous
oaths
heaved
through
the
air
.
The
room
rang
with
the
*NL*
shrill
voices
of
women
bubbling
o'er
with
drink-laughter
.
The
chief
*NL*
element
in
the
music
of
the
orchestra
was
speed
.
The
musicians
played
*NL*
in
intent
fury
.
A
woman
was
singing
and
smiling
upon
the
stage
,
but
no
*NL*
one
took
notice
of
her
.
The
rate
at
which
the
piano
,
cornet
and
*NL*
violins
were
going
,
seemed
to
impart
wildness
to
the
half-drunken
*NL*
crowd
.
Beer
glasses
were
emptied
at
a
gulp
and
conversation
became
a
*NL*
rapid
chatter
.
The
smoke
eddied
and
swirled
like
a
shadowy
river
*NL*
hurrying
toward
some
unseen
falls
.
Pete
and
Maggie
entered
the
hall
*NL*
and
took
chairs
at
a
table
near
the
door
.
The
woman
who
was
seated
*NL*
there
made
an
attempt
to
occupy
Pete
's
attention
and
,
failing
,
went
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
weeks
had
passed
since
the
girl
had
left
home
.
The
air
of
*NL*
spaniel-like
dependence
had
been
magnified
and
showed
its
direct
effect
*NL*
in
the
peculiar
off-handedness
and
ease
of
Pete
's
ways
toward
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
Pete
's
eyes
with
hers
,
anticipating
with
smiles
gracious
*NL*
looks
from
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
,
accompanied
by
a
mere
boy
,
came
*NL*
into
the
place
and
took
seats
near
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
once
Pete
sprang
to
his
feet
,
his
face
beaming
with
glad
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Gawd
,
there
's
Nellie
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
over
to
the
table
and
held
out
an
eager
hand
to
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
hello
,
Pete
,
me
boy
,
how
are
you
,
''
said
she
,
giving
him
her
*NL*
fingers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
took
instant
note
of
the
woman
.
She
perceived
that
her
black
*NL*
dress
fitted
her
to
perfection
.
Her
linen
collar
and
cuffs
were
*NL*
spotless
.
Tan
gloves
were
stretched
over
her
well-shaped
hands
.
A
hat
*NL*
of
a
prevailing
fashion
perched
jauntily
upon
her
dark
hair
.
She
wore
*NL*
no
jewelry
and
was
painted
with
no
apparent
paint
.
She
looked
*NL*
clear-eyed
through
the
stares
of
the
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sit
down
,
and
call
your
lady-friend
over
,
''
she
said
cordially
to
Pete
.
*NL*
At
his
beckoning
Maggie
came
and
sat
between
Pete
and
the
mere
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
yeh
were
gone
away
fer
good
,
''
began
Pete
,
at
once
.
``
When
*NL*
did
yeh
git
back
?
How
did
dat
Buff
`
lo
bus
`
ness
turn
out
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
shrugged
her
shoulders
.
``
Well
,
he
did
n't
have
as
many
stamps
*NL*
as
he
tried
to
make
out
,
so
I
shook
him
,
that
's
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
glad
teh
see
yehs
back
in
deh
city
,
''
said
Pete
,
with
awkward
*NL*
gallantry
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
and
the
woman
entered
into
a
long
conversation
,
exchanging
*NL*
reminiscences
of
days
together
.
Maggie
sat
still
,
unable
to
formulate
*NL*
an
intelligent
sentence
upon
the
conversation
and
painfully
aware
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
Pete
's
eyes
sparkle
as
he
gazed
upon
the
handsome
stranger
.
He
*NL*
listened
smilingly
to
all
she
said
.
The
woman
was
familiar
with
all
*NL*
his
affairs
,
asked
him
about
mutual
friends
,
and
knew
the
amount
of
his
*NL*
salary
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
paid
no
attention
to
Maggie
,
looking
toward
her
once
or
twice
and
*NL*
apparently
seeing
the
wall
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mere
boy
was
sulky
.
In
the
beginning
he
had
welcomed
with
*NL*
acclamations
the
additions
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
all
have
a
drink
!
What
'll
you
take
,
Nell
?
And
you
,
Miss
*NL*
what
's
-
your-name
.
Have
a
drink
,
Mr.
-----
,
you
,
I
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
shown
a
sprightly
desire
to
do
the
talking
for
the
company
and
*NL*
tell
all
about
his
family
.
In
a
loud
voice
he
declaimed
on
various
*NL*
topics
.
He
assumed
a
patronizing
air
toward
Pete
.
As
Maggie
was
*NL*
silent
,
he
paid
no
attention
to
her
.
He
made
a
great
show
of
lavishing
*NL*
wealth
upon
the
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
keep
still
,
Freddie
!
You
gibber
like
an
ape
,
dear
,
''
said
the
woman
*NL*
to
him
.
She
turned
away
and
devoted
her
attention
to
Pete
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
many
a
good
time
together
again
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
Mike
,
''
said
Pete
,
enthusiastic
at
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
whispered
she
,
leaning
forward
,
``
let
's
go
over
to
Billie
's
and
*NL*
have
a
heluva
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
's
dis
way
!
See
?
''
said
Pete
.
``
I
got
dis
lady
frien
'
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
t
`
hell
with
her
,
''
argued
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
appeared
disturbed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
said
she
,
nodding
her
head
at
him
.
``
All
right
for
you
!
*NL*
We
'll
see
the
next
time
you
ask
me
to
go
anywheres
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
squirmed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
''
he
said
,
beseechingly
,
``
come
wid
me
a
minit
an
'
I
'll
tell
yer
*NL*
why
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
waved
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
that
's
all
right
,
you
need
n't
explain
,
you
know
.
You
would
n't
*NL*
come
merely
because
you
would
n't
come
,
that
's
all
there
is
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Pete
's
visible
distress
she
turned
to
the
mere
boy
,
bringing
him
*NL*
speedily
from
a
terrific
rage
.
He
had
been
debating
whether
it
would
*NL*
be
the
part
of
a
man
to
pick
a
quarrel
with
Pete
,
or
would
he
be
*NL*
justified
in
striking
him
savagely
with
his
beer
glass
without
warning
.
*NL*
But
he
recovered
himself
when
the
woman
turned
to
renew
her
smilings
.
*NL*
He
beamed
upon
her
with
an
expression
that
was
somewhat
tipsy
and
*NL*
inexpressibly
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
shake
that
Bowery
jay
,
''
requested
he
,
in
a
loud
whisper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Freddie
,
you
are
so
droll
,
''
she
replied
.
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
reached
forward
and
touched
the
woman
on
the
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
out
a
minit
while
I
tells
yeh
why
I
ca
n't
go
wid
yer

Yer
doin

*NL*

I
never
taut
ye
'd
do
me
dirt
,
Nell
.
Come
on
,
will
*NL*
yer
?
''
He
spoke
in
tones
of
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
see
why
I
should
be
interested
in
your
explanations
,
''
*NL*
said
the
woman
,
with
a
coldness
that
seemed
to
reduce
Pete
to
a
pulp
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
eyes
pleaded
with
her
.
``
Come
out
a
minit
while
I
tells
yeh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
nodded
slightly
at
Maggie
and
the
mere
boy
,
''
`
Scuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
mere
boy
interrupted
his
loving
smile
and
turned
a
shrivelling
*NL*
glare
upon
Pete
.
His
boyish
countenance
flushed
and
he
spoke
,
in
a
*NL*
whine
,
to
the
woman
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
say
,
Nellie
,
this
ai
n't
a
square
deal
,
you
know
.
You
are
n't
*NL*
goin
'
to
leave
me
and
go
off
with
that
duffer
,
are
you
?
I
should
*NL*
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
you
dear
boy
,
of
course
I
'm
not
,
''
cried
the
woman
,
*NL*
affectionately
.
She
bended
over
and
whispered
in
his
ear
.
He
smiled
*NL*
again
and
settled
in
his
chair
as
if
resolved
to
wait
patiently
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
woman
walked
down
between
the
rows
of
tables
,
Pete
was
at
her
*NL*
shoulder
talking
earnestly
,
apparently
in
explanation
.
The
woman
waved
*NL*
her
hands
with
studied
airs
of
indifference
.
The
doors
swung
behind
*NL*
them
,
leaving
Maggie
and
the
mere
boy
seated
at
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
dazed
.
She
could
dimly
perceive
that
something
stupendous
*NL*
had
happened
.
She
wondered
why
Pete
saw
fit
to
remonstrate
with
the
*NL*
woman
,
pleading
for
forgiveness
with
his
eyes
.
She
thought
she
noted
*NL*
an
air
of
submission
about
her
leonine
Pete
.
She
was
astounded
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mere
boy
occupied
himself
with
cock-tails
and
a
cigar
.
He
was
*NL*
tranquilly
silent
for
half
an
hour
.
Then
he
bestirred
himself
and
*NL*
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
he
said
,
sighing
,
``
I
knew
this
was
the
way
it
would
be
.
''
There
*NL*
was
another
stillness
.
The
mere
boy
seemed
to
be
musing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
was
pulling
m
`
leg
.
That
's
the
whole
amount
of
it
,
''
he
said
,
*NL*
suddenly
.
``
It
's
a
bloomin
'
shame
the
way
that
girl
does
.
Why
,
I
've
*NL*
spent
over
two
dollars
in
drinks
to-night
.
And
she
goes
off
with
that
*NL*
plug-ugly
who
looks
as
if
he
had
been
hit
in
the
face
with
a
coin-die
.
*NL*
I
call
it
rocky
treatment
for
a
fellah
like
me
.
Here
,
waiter
,
bring
me
*NL*
a
cock-tail
and
make
it
damned
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
made
no
reply
.
She
was
watching
the
doors
.
``
It
's
a
mean
piece
*NL*
of
business
,
''
complained
the
mere
boy
.
He
explained
to
her
how
amazing
*NL*
it
was
that
anybody
should
treat
him
in
such
a
manner
.
``
But
I
'll
get
*NL*
square
with
her
,
you
bet
.
She
wo
n't
get
far
ahead
of
yours
truly
,
you
*NL*
know
,
''
he
added
,
winking
.
``
I
'll
tell
her
plainly
that
it
was
bloomin
'
*NL*
mean
business
.
And
she
wo
n't
come
it
over
me
with
any
of
her
*NL*
`
now-Freddie-dears
.
'
She
thinks
my
name
is
Freddie
,
you
know
,
but
of
*NL*
course
it
ai
n't
.
I
always
tell
these
people
some
name
like
that
,
*NL*
because
if
they
got
onto
your
right
name
they
might
use
it
sometime
.
*NL*
Understand
?
Oh
,
they
do
n't
fool
me
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
was
paying
no
attention
,
being
intent
upon
the
doors
.
The
mere
*NL*
boy
relapsed
into
a
period
of
gloom
,
during
which
he
exterminated
a
*NL*
number
of
cock-tails
with
a
determined
air
,
as
if
replying
defiantly
to
*NL*
fate
.
He
occasionally
broke
forth
into
sentences
composed
of
*NL*
invectives
joined
together
in
a
long
string
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
was
still
staring
at
the
doors
.
After
a
time
the
mere
boy
*NL*
began
to
see
cobwebs
just
in
front
of
his
nose
.
He
spurred
himself
*NL*
into
being
agreeable
and
insisted
upon
her
having
a
charlotte-russe
and
*NL*
a
glass
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
's
gone
,
''
he
remarked
,
``
they
's
gone
.
''
He
looked
at
her
through
*NL*
the
smoke
wreaths
.
``
Shay

mightish
well
make

of

*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
stood
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
home
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
mere
boy
started
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
What
?
Home
,
''
he
cried
,
struck
with
amazement
.
``
I
beg
pardon
,
*NL*
did
hear
say
home

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
she
repeated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
Gawd
,
what
hava
struck

''
demanded
the
mere
boy
of
himself
,
*NL*
stupefied
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
semi-comatose
state
he
conducted
her
on
board
an
up-town
car
,
*NL*
ostentatiously
paid
her
fare
,
leered
kindly
at
her
through
the
rear
*NL*
window
and
fell
off
the
steps
.

Chapter
XV
*NL*
*NL*
A
forlorn
woman
went
along
a
lighted
avenue
.
The
street
was
filled
*NL*
with
people
desperately
bound
on
missions
.
An
endless
crowd
darted
at
*NL*
the
elevated
station
stairs
and
the
horse
cars
were
thronged
with
*NL*
owners
of
bundles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pace
of
the
forlorn
woman
was
slow
.
She
was
apparently
searching
*NL*
for
some
one
.
She
loitered
near
the
doors
of
saloons
and
watched
men
*NL*
emerge
from
them
.
She
scanned
furtively
the
faces
in
the
rushing
*NL*
stream
of
pedestrians
.
Hurrying
men
,
bent
on
catching
some
boat
or
*NL*
train
,
jostled
her
elbows
,
failing
to
notice
her
,
their
thoughts
fixed
*NL*
on
distant
dinners
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
forlorn
woman
had
a
peculiar
face
.
Her
smile
was
no
smile
.
But
*NL*
when
in
repose
her
features
had
a
shadowy
look
that
was
like
a
sardonic
*NL*
grin
,
as
if
some
one
had
sketched
with
cruel
forefinger
indelible
lines
*NL*
about
her
mouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
came
strolling
up
the
avenue
.
The
woman
encountered
him
with
an
*NL*
aggrieved
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Jimmie
,
I
've
been
lookin
'
all
over
fer
yehs
--
,
''
she
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
quickened
his
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
do
n't
bodder
me
!
Good
Gawd
!
''
he
said
,
with
the
savageness
of
a
*NL*
man
whose
life
is
pestered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
followed
him
along
the
sidewalk
in
somewhat
the
manner
of
a
*NL*
suppliant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Jimmie
,
''
she
said
,
``
yehs
told
me
ye
'd
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
turned
upon
her
fiercely
as
if
resolved
to
make
a
last
stand
for
*NL*
comfort
and
peace
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
fer
Gawd
's

*NL*
The
woman
stepped
closer
and
laid
her
fingers
on
his
arm
.
``
But
,
*NL*
look-a-here
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Jimmie
snarled
.
``
Oh
,
go
teh
hell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
darted
into
the
front
door
of
a
convenient
saloon
and
a
moment
later
*NL*
came
out
into
the
shadows
that
surrounded
the
side
door
.
On
the
*NL*
brilliantly
lighted
avenue
he
perceived
the
forlorn
woman
dodging
about
*NL*
like
a
scout
.
Jimmie
laughed
with
an
air
of
relief
and
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
arrived
home
he
found
his
mother
clamoring
.
Maggie
had
*NL*
returned
.
She
stood
shivering
beneath
the
torrent
of
her
mother
's
*NL*
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
'm
damned
,
''
said
Jimmie
in
greeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
mother
,
tottering
about
the
room
,
pointed
a
quivering
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
screamed
in
scoffing
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
room
.
She
edged
about
as
if
unable
*NL*
to
find
a
place
on
the
floor
to
put
her
feet
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha

the

*NL*
*NL*
She
lurched
forward
and
put
her
red
and
seamed
hands
upon
her
*NL*
daughter
's
face
.
She
bent
down
and
peered
keenly
up
into
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*
The
loud
,
tremendous
sneering
of
the
mother
brought
the
denizens
of
the
*NL*
Rum
Alley
tenement
to
their
doors
.
Women
came
in
the
hallways
.
*NL*
Children
scurried
to
and
fro
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

``
Deh

''
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
open
door
curious
eyes
stared
in
at
Maggie
.
Children
*NL*
ventured
into
the
room
and
ogled
her
,
as
if
they
formed
the
front
row
*NL*
at
a
theatre
.
Women
,
without
,
bended
toward
each
other
and
whispered
,
*NL*
nodding
their
heads
with
airs
of
profound
philosophy
.
A
baby
,
overcome
*NL*
with
curiosity
concerning
this
object
at
which
all
were
looking
,
sidled
*NL*
forward
and
touched
her
dress
,
cautiously
,
as
if
investigating
a
*NL*
red-hot
stove
.
Its
mother
's
voice
rang
out
like
a
warning
trumpet
.
*NL*
She
rushed
forward
and
grabbed
her
child
,
casting
a
terrible
look
of
*NL*
indignation
at
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
's
mother
paced
to
and
fro
,
addressing
the
doorful
of
eyes
,
*NL*
expounding
like
a
glib
showman
at
a
museum
.
Her
voice
rang
through
the
*NL*
building
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dere
she
stands
,
''
she
cried
,
wheeling
suddenly
and
pointing
with
*NL*
dramatic
finger
.
``
Dere

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
jeering
cries
ended
in
another
burst
of
shrill
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
seemed
to
awaken
.
``
Jimmie
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
drew
hastily
back
from
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
now
,
yer
a
hell
of
a
t
`
ing
,

yeh

''
he
said
,
his
lips
curling
*NL*
in
scorn
.
Radiant
virtue
sat
upon
his
brow
and
his
repelling
hands
*NL*
expressed
horror
of
contamination
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
turned
and
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
crowd
at
the
door
fell
back
precipitately
.
A
baby
falling
down
in
*NL*
front
of
the
door
,
wrenched
a
scream
like
a
wounded
animal
from
its
*NL*
mother
.
Another
woman
sprang
forward
and
picked
it
up
,
with
a
*NL*
chivalrous
air
,
as
if
rescuing
a
human
being
from
an
oncoming
express
*NL*
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
girl
passed
down
through
the
hall
,
she
went
before
open
doors
*NL*
framing
more
eyes
strangely
microscopic
,
and
sending
broad
beams
of
*NL*
inquisitive
light
into
the
darkness
of
her
path
.
On
the
second
floor
*NL*
she
met
the
gnarled
old
woman
who
possessed
the
music
box
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So

she
cried
,
''

''
*NL*
*NL*
From
above
came
an
unceasing
babble
of
tongues
,
over
all
of
which
rang
*NL*
the
mother
's
derisive
laughter
.

Chapter
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
did
not
consider
that
he
had
ruined
Maggie
.
If
he
had
thought
*NL*
that
her
soul
could
never
smile
again
,
he
would
have
believed
the
*NL*
mother
and
brother
,
who
were
pyrotechnic
over
the
affair
,
to
be
*NL*
responsible
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
,
in
his
world
,
souls
did
not
insist
upon
being
able
to
smile
.
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
felt
a
trifle
entangled
.
It
distressed
him
.
Revelations
and
scenes
*NL*
might
bring
upon
him
the
wrath
of
the
owner
of
the
saloon
,
who
insisted
*NL*
upon
respectability
of
an
advanced
type
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
deh
hell
do
dey
wan
na
raise
such
a
smoke
about
it
fer
?
''
demanded
*NL*
he
of
himself
,
disgusted
with
the
attitude
of
the
family
.
He
saw
no
*NL*
necessity
for
anyone
's
losing
their
equilibrium
merely
because
their
*NL*
sister
or
their
daughter
had
stayed
away
from
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Searching
about
in
his
mind
for
possible
reasons
for
their
conduct
,
he
*NL*
came
upon
the
conclusion
that
Maggie
's
motives
were
correct
,
but
that
*NL*
the
two
others
wished
to
snare
him
.
He
felt
pursued
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
whom
he
had
met
in
the
hilarious
*NL*
hall
showed
a
disposition
to
ridicule
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
pale
thing
with
no
spirit
,
''
she
said
.
``
Did
you
note
the
*NL*
expression
of
her
eyes
?
There
was
something
in
them
about
pumpkin
pie
*NL*
and
virtue
.
That
is
a
peculiar
way
the
left
corner
of
her
mouth
has
of
*NL*
twitching
,
is
n't
it
?
Dear
,
dear
,
my
cloud-compelling
Pete
,
what
are
*NL*
you
coming
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
asserted
at
once
that
he
never
was
very
much
interested
in
the
*NL*
girl
.
The
woman
interrupted
him
,
laughing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
's
not
of
the
slightest
consequence
to
me
,
my
dear
young
man
.
*NL*
You
need
n't
draw
maps
for
my
benefit
.
Why
should
I
be
concerned
about
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Pete
continued
with
his
explanations
.
If
he
was
laughed
at
for
his
*NL*
tastes
in
women
,
he
felt
obliged
to
say
that
they
were
only
temporary
*NL*
or
indifferent
ones
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morning
after
Maggie
had
departed
from
home
,
Pete
stood
behind
the
*NL*
bar
.
He
was
immaculate
in
white
jacket
and
apron
and
his
hair
was
*NL*
plastered
over
his
brow
with
infinite
correctness
.
No
customers
were
*NL*
in
the
place
.
Pete
was
twisting
his
napkined
fist
slowly
in
a
beer
*NL*
glass
,
softly
whistling
to
himself
and
occasionally
holding
the
object
*NL*
of
his
attention
between
his
eyes
and
a
few
weak
beams
of
sunlight
that
*NL*
had
found
their
way
over
the
thick
screens
and
into
the
shaded
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
lingering
thoughts
of
the
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
,
the
*NL*
bartender
raised
his
head
and
stared
through
the
varying
cracks
between
*NL*
the
swaying
bamboo
doors
.
Suddenly
the
whistling
pucker
faded
from
his
*NL*
lips
.
He
saw
Maggie
walking
slowly
past
.
He
gave
a
great
start
,
*NL*
fearing
for
the
previously-mentioned
eminent
respectability
of
the
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
threw
a
swift
,
nervous
glance
about
him
,
all
at
once
feeling
guilty
.
*NL*
No
one
was
in
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
hastily
over
to
the
side
door
.
Opening
it
and
looking
out
,
he
*NL*
perceived
Maggie
standing
,
as
if
undecided
,
on
the
corner
.
She
was
*NL*
searching
the
place
with
her
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
turned
her
face
toward
him
Pete
beckoned
to
her
hurriedly
,
*NL*
intent
upon
returning
with
speed
to
a
position
behind
the
bar
and
to
*NL*
the
atmosphere
of
respectability
upon
which
the
proprietor
insisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
came
to
him
,
the
anxious
look
disappearing
from
her
face
and
a
*NL*
smile
wreathing
her
lips
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Pete
--
,
''
she
began
brightly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
bartender
made
a
violent
gesture
of
impatience
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
Gawd
,
''
cried
he
,
vehemently
.
``
What
deh
hell
do
yeh
wan
na
hang
*NL*
aroun
'
here
fer
?
Do
yeh
wan
na
git

''
he
demanded
with
*NL*
an
air
of
injury
.
*NL*
*NL*
Astonishment
swept
over
the
girl
's
features
.
``
Why
,
Pete
!
yehs
tol
'
*NL*
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pete
glanced
profound
irritation
.
His
countenance
reddened
with
the
*NL*
anger
of
a
man
whose
respectability
is
being
threatened
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
yehs
makes
me
tired
.
See
?
What

See

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
's
eyes
stared
into
his
face
.
``
Pete
,
do
n't
yeh
remem
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
hell
,
''
interrupted
Pete
,
anticipating
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
seemed
to
have
a
struggle
with
herself
.
She
was
apparently
*NL*
bewildered
and
could
not
find
speech
.
Finally
she
asked
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
:
``
But
where
kin
I
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
question
exasperated
Pete
beyond
the
powers
of
endurance
.
It
was
a
*NL*
direct
attempt
to
give
him
some
responsibility
in
a
matter
that
did
not
*NL*
concern
him
.
In
his
indignation
he
volunteered
information
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
go
teh
hell
,
''
cried
he
.
He
slammed
the
door
furiously
and
*NL*
returned
,
with
an
air
of
relief
,
to
his
respectability
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maggie
went
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wandered
aimlessly
for
several
blocks
.
She
stopped
once
and
asked
*NL*
aloud
a
question
of
herself
:
``
Who
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
who
was
passing
near
her
shoulder
,
humorously
took
the
*NL*
questioning
word
as
intended
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Eh
?
What
?
Who
?
Nobody
!
I
did
n't
say
anything
,
''
he
laughingly
said
,
*NL*
and
continued
his
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Soon
the
girl
discovered
that
if
she
walked
with
such
apparent
*NL*
aimlessness
,
some
men
looked
at
her
with
calculating
eyes
.
She
*NL*
quickened
her
step
,
frightened
.
As
a
protection
,
she
adopted
a
*NL*
demeanor
of
intentness
as
if
going
somewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
she
left
rattling
avenues
and
passed
between
rows
of
*NL*
houses
with
sternness
and
stolidity
stamped
upon
their
features
.
She
*NL*
hung
her
head
for
she
felt
their
eyes
grimly
upon
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
came
upon
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
silk
hat
and
a
chaste
*NL*
black
coat
,
whose
decorous
row
of
buttons
reached
from
his
chin
to
his
*NL*
knees
.
The
girl
had
heard
of
the
Grace
of
God
and
she
decided
to
*NL*
approach
this
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
beaming
,
chubby
face
was
a
picture
of
benevolence
and
*NL*
kind-heartedness
.
His
eyes
shone
good-will
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
the
girl
timidly
accosted
him
,
he
gave
a
convulsive
movement
and
*NL*
saved
his
respectability
by
a
vigorous
side-step
.
He
did
not
risk
it
*NL*
to
save
a
soul
.
For
how
was
he
to
know
that
there
was
a
soul
before
*NL*
him
that
needed
saving
?

Chapter
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
a
wet
evening
,
several
months
after
the
last
chapter
,
two
*NL*
interminable
rows
of
cars
,
pulled
by
slipping
horses
,
jangled
along
a
*NL*
prominent
side-street
.
A
dozen
cabs
,
with
coat-enshrouded
drivers
,
*NL*
clattered
to
and
fro
.
Electric
lights
,
whirring
softly
,
shed
a
blurred
*NL*
radiance
.
A
flower
dealer
,
his
feet
tapping
impatiently
,
his
nose
and
*NL*
his
wares
glistening
with
rain-drops
,
stood
behind
an
array
of
roses
*NL*
and
chrysanthemums
.
Two
or
three
theatres
emptied
a
crowd
upon
the
*NL*
storm-swept
pavements
.
Men
pulled
their
hats
over
their
eyebrows
and
*NL*
raised
their
collars
to
their
ears
.
Women
shrugged
impatient
shoulders
*NL*
in
their
warm
cloaks
and
stopped
to
arrange
their
skirts
for
a
walk
*NL*
through
the
storm
.
People
having
been
comparatively
silent
for
two
*NL*
hours
burst
into
a
roar
of
conversation
,
their
hearts
still
kindling
*NL*
from
the
glowings
of
the
stage
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pavements
became
tossing
seas
of
umbrellas
.
Men
stepped
forth
to
*NL*
hail
cabs
or
cars
,
raising
their
fingers
in
varied
forms
of
polite
*NL*
request
or
imperative
demand
.
An
endless
procession
wended
toward
*NL*
elevated
stations
.
An
atmosphere
of
pleasure
and
prosperity
seemed
to
*NL*
hang
over
the
throng
,
born
,
perhaps
,
of
good
clothes
and
of
having
just
*NL*
emerged
from
a
place
of
forgetfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mingled
light
and
gloom
of
an
adjacent
park
,
a
handful
of
wet
*NL*
wanderers
,
in
attitudes
of
chronic
dejection
,
was
scattered
among
the
*NL*
benches
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
girl
of
the
painted
cohorts
of
the
city
went
along
the
street
.
She
*NL*
threw
changing
glances
at
men
who
passed
her
,
giving
smiling
*NL*
invitations
to
men
of
rural
or
untaught
pattern
and
usually
seeming
*NL*
sedately
unconscious
of
the
men
with
a
metropolitan
seal
upon
their
*NL*
faces
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crossing
glittering
avenues
,
she
went
into
the
throng
emerging
from
the
*NL*
places
of
forgetfulness
.
She
hurried
forward
through
the
crowd
as
if
*NL*
intent
upon
reaching
a
distant
home
,
bending
forward
in
her
handsome
*NL*
cloak
,
daintily
lifting
her
skirts
and
picking
for
her
well-shod
feet
*NL*
the
dryer
spots
upon
the
pavements
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
restless
doors
of
saloons
,
clashing
to
and
fro
,
disclosed
animated
*NL*
rows
of
men
before
bars
and
hurrying
barkeepers
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
concert
hall
gave
to
the
street
faint
sounds
of
swift
,
machine-like
*NL*
music
,
as
if
a
group
of
phantom
musicians
were
hastening
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
tall
young
man
,
smoking
a
cigarette
with
a
sublime
air
,
strolled
near
*NL*
the
girl
.
He
had
on
evening
dress
,
a
moustache
,
a
chrysanthemum
,
and
a
*NL*
look
of
ennui
,
all
of
which
he
kept
carefully
under
his
eye
.
Seeing
*NL*
the
girl
walk
on
as
if
such
a
young
man
as
he
was
not
in
existence
,
he
*NL*
looked
back
transfixed
with
interest
.
He
stared
glassily
for
a
moment
,
*NL*
but
gave
a
slight
convulsive
start
when
he
discerned
that
she
was
*NL*
neither
new
,
Parisian
,
nor
theatrical
.
He
wheeled
about
hastily
and
*NL*
turned
his
stare
into
the
air
,
like
a
sailor
with
a
search-light
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
stout
gentleman
,
with
pompous
and
philanthropic
whiskers
,
went
*NL*
stolidly
by
,
the
broad
of
his
back
sneering
at
the
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
belated
man
in
business
clothes
,
and
in
haste
to
catch
a
car
,
bounced
*NL*
against
her
shoulder
.
``
Hi
,
there
,
Mary
,
I
beg
your
pardon
!
Brace
up
,
*NL*
old
girl
.
''
He
grasped
her
arm
to
steady
her
,
and
then
was
away
running
*NL*
down
the
middle
of
the
street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
walked
on
out
of
the
realm
of
restaurants
and
saloons
.
She
*NL*
passed
more
glittering
avenues
and
went
into
darker
blocks
than
those
*NL*
where
the
crowd
travelled
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
man
in
light
overcoat
and
derby
hat
received
a
glance
shot
*NL*
keenly
from
the
eyes
of
the
girl
.
He
stopped
and
looked
at
her
,
*NL*
thrusting
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
making
a
mocking
smile
curl
his
*NL*
lips
.
``
Come
,
now
,
old
lady
,
''
he
said
,
``
you
do
n't
mean
to
tel
me
that
*NL*
you
sized
me
up
for
a
farmer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
labouring
man
marched
along
;
with
bundles
under
his
arms
.
To
her
*NL*
remarks
,
he
replied
,
``
It
's
a
fine
evenin
'
,
ai
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
squarely
into
the
face
of
a
boy
who
was
hurrying
by
with
his
*NL*
hands
buried
in
his
overcoat
pockets
,
his
blonde
locks
bobbing
on
his
*NL*
youthful
temples
,
and
a
cheery
smile
of
unconcern
upon
his
lips
.
He
*NL*
turned
his
head
and
smiled
back
at
her
,
waving
his
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
this
eve
--
some
other
eve
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
drunken
man
,
reeling
in
her
pathway
,
began
to
roar
at
her
.
``
I
ain
'
ga
*NL*
no
money
!
''
he
shouted
,
in
a
dismal
voice
.
He
lurched
on
up
the
street
,
*NL*
wailing
to
himself
:
``
I
ain
'
ga
no
money
.
Ba
'
luck
.
Ain
'
ga
no
more
*NL*
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
girl
went
into
gloomy
districts
near
the
river
,
where
the
tall
*NL*
black
factories
shut
in
the
street
and
only
occasional
broad
beams
of
*NL*
light
fell
across
the
pavements
from
saloons
.
In
front
of
one
of
these
*NL*
places
,
whence
came
the
sound
of
a
violin
vigorously
scraped
,
the
*NL*
patter
of
feet
on
boards
and
the
ring
of
loud
laughter
,
there
stood
a
*NL*
man
with
blotched
features
.
*NL*
*NL*
Further
on
in
the
darkness
she
met
a
ragged
being
with
shifting
,
*NL*
bloodshot
eyes
and
grimy
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
into
the
blackness
of
the
final
block
.
The
shutters
of
the
*NL*
tall
buildings
were
closed
like
grim
lips
.
The
structures
seemed
to
*NL*
have
eyes
that
looked
over
them
,
beyond
them
,
at
other
things
.
Afar
off
*NL*
the
lights
of
the
avenues
glittered
as
if
from
an
impossible
distance
.
*NL*
Street-car
bells
jingled
with
a
sound
of
merriment
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
feet
of
the
tall
buildings
appeared
the
deathly
black
hue
of
the
*NL*
river
.
Some
hidden
factory
sent
up
a
yellow
glare
,
that
lit
for
a
*NL*
moment
the
waters
lapping
oilily
against
timbers
.
The
varied
sounds
of
*NL*
life
,
made
joyous
by
distance
and
seeming
unapproachableness
,
came
*NL*
faintly
and
died
away
to
a
silence
.
*NL*

Chapter
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
partitioned-off
section
of
a
saloon
sat
a
man
with
a
half
dozen
*NL*
women
,
gleefully
laughing
,
hovering
about
him
.
The
man
had
arrived
at
*NL*
that
stage
of
drunkenness
where
affection
is
felt
for
the
universe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
good
f
`
ler
,
girls
,
''
he
said
,
convincingly
.
``
I

*NL*
An

See
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
nodded
their
heads
approvingly
.
``
To
be
sure
,
''
they
cried
out
*NL*
in
hearty
chorus
.
``
You
're
the
kind
of
a
man

like

Pete
.
You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A

`
ing
yehs

,
damn
it
,
''
said
the
man
in
an
abandonment
of
good
*NL*
will
.
His
countenance
shone
with
the
true
spirit
of
benevolence
.
He
*NL*
was
in
the
proper
mode
of
missionaries
.
He
would
have
fraternized
with
*NL*
obscure
Hottentots
.
And
above
all
,
he
was
overwhelmed
in
tenderness
*NL*
for
his
friends
,
who
were
all
illustrious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
n't
`
ing
yehs
wants
,
damn
it
,
''
repeated
he
,
waving
his
hands
with
*NL*
beneficent
recklessness
.
``

'm

`

,
an

if

''
called
he
through
an
open
door
to
a
waiter
,
``

What

A

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
glanced
in
with
the
disgusted
look
of
the
man
who
serves
*NL*
intoxicants
for
the
man
who
takes
too
much
of
them
.
He
nodded
his
head
*NL*
shortly
at
the
order
from
each
individual
,
and
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn

,
''
said
the
man
,
``

*NL*
Damn

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
at
length
and
with
feeling
,
concerning
the
excellencies
of
his
*NL*
assembled
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Don

''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
the
times
of
the
arrival
and
departure
of
the
waiter
,
the
man
*NL*
discoursed
to
the
women
on
the
tender
regard
he
felt
for
all
living
*NL*
things
.
He
laid
stress
upon
the
purity
of
his
motives
in
all
dealings
*NL*
with
men
in
the
world
and
spoke
of
the
fervor
of
his
friendship
for
*NL*
those
who
were
amiable
.
Tears
welled
slowly
from
his
eyes
.
His
voice
*NL*
quavered
when
he
spoke
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
when
the
waiter
was
about
to
depart
with
an
empty
tray
,
the
man
*NL*
drew
a
coin
from
his
pocket
and
held
it
forth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
''
said
he
,
quite
magnificently
,
``
here
's
quar
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
waiter
kept
his
hands
on
his
tray
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
don
'
want
yer
money
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
put
forth
the
coin
with
tearful
insistence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
,
damn
it
,
''
cried
he
,
``

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

,
''
said
the
waiter
,
with
the
sullen
air
of
a
man
who
is
*NL*
forced
into
giving
advice
.
``
Put

Yer

*NL*

.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
latter
passed
out
of
the
door
the
man
turned
pathetically
to
the
*NL*
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
don
'
know
I
'm
damn
goo

f

''
cried
he
,
dismally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never

,
Pete
,
dear
,
''
said
a
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
,
*NL*
laying
her
hand
with
great
affection
upon
his
arm
.
``
Never

'll

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried
the
man
,
his
face
lighting
up
at
the
soothing
tones
of
*NL*
the
woman
's
voice
.
``

the
women
.
``
And
we
're
not

*NL*
*NL*
The
man
turned
appealing
eyes
to
the
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
.
*NL*
He
felt
that
if
he
could
be
convicted
of
a
contemptible
action
he
would
*NL*
die
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

assented
the
woman

She
delivered
an
oration
to
*NL*
her
companions
.
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

they
exclaimed
.
Looking
lovingly
at
him
they
raised
their
*NL*
glasses
and
drank
his
health
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

chorused

The

pounded
the

with
his
quivering
fists

*NL*
*NL*
``

cried

with

swelled
with
wrath

The

sat
down

He
felt
a
sleepy

strong
desire

out

a

Overwhelmed

drunken
adoration

he
drew
two

three
bills

from
his
pocket

,
with
the
trembling
fingers
of
an

priest

laid

the
table
before
the
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

Shortly
he
went
to
sleep
with
his
swollen
face
fallen
forward
on
his
*NL*
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
drank
and
laughed
,
not
heeding
the
slumbering
man
in
the
*NL*
corner
.
Finally
he
lurched
forward
and
fell
groaning
to
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
women
screamed
in
disgust
and
drew
back
their
skirts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
ahn
,
''
cried
one
,
starting
up
angrily
,
``
let
's
get
out
of
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
of
brilliance
and
audacity
stayed
behind
,
taking
up
the
bills
*NL*
and
stuffing
them
into
a
deep
,
irregularly-shaped
pocket
.
A
guttural
*NL*
snore
from
the
recumbent
man
caused
her
to
turn
and
look
down
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
laughed
.
``
What
a
damn
fool
,
''
she
said
,
and
went
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smoke
from
the
lamps
settled
heavily
down
in
the
little
*NL*
compartment
,
obscuring
the
way
out
.
The
smell
of
oil
,
stifling
in
its
*NL*
intensity
,
pervaded
the
air
.
The
wine
from
an
overturned
glass
dripped
*NL*
softly
down
upon
the
blotches
on
the
man
's
neck
.

Chapter
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
room
a
woman
sat
at
a
table
eating
like
a
fat
monk
in
a
picture
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soiled
,
unshaven
man
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
Mag
's
dead
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
said
the
woman
,
her
mouth
filled
with
bread
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mag
's
dead
,
''
repeated
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deh
hell
she
is
,
''
said
the
woman
.
She
continued
her
meal
.
When
she
*NL*
finished
her
coffee
she
began
to
weep
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
kin
remember
when
her
two
feet
was
no
bigger
dan
yer
t
`
umb
,
and
she
*NL*
weared
worsted
boots
,
''
moaned
she
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
whata
dat
?
''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
kin
remember
when
she
weared
worsted
boots
,
''
she
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
neighbors
began
to
gather
in
the
hall
,
staring
in
at
the
weeping
*NL*
woman
as
if
watching
the
contortions
of
a
dying
dog
.
A
dozen
women
*NL*
entered
and
lamented
with
her
.
Under
their
busy
hands
the
rooms
took
*NL*
on
that
appalling
appearance
of
neatness
and
order
with
which
death
is
*NL*
greeted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
the
door
opened
and
a
woman
in
a
black
gown
rushed
in
with
*NL*
outstretched
arms
.
``
Ah
,
poor
Mary
,
''
she
cried
,
and
tenderly
embraced
*NL*
the
moaning
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
what
ter
`
ble
affliction
is
dis
,
''
continued
she
.
Her
vocabulary
*NL*
was
derived
from
mission
churches
.
``
Me
poor
Mary
,
how
I
feel
fer
yehs
!
*NL*
Ah
,
what
a
ter
`
ble
affliction
is
a
disobed
`
ent
chil
'
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
good
,
motherly
face
was
wet
with
tears
.
She
trembled
in
eagerness
*NL*
to
express
her
sympathy
.
The
mourner
sat
with
bowed
head
,
rocking
her
*NL*
body
heavily
to
and
fro
,
and
crying
out
in
a
high
,
strained
voice
that
*NL*
sounded
like
a
dirge
on
some
forlorn
pipe
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
kin
remember
when
she
weared
worsted
boots
an
'
her
two
feets

*NL*
bigger

Miss
Smith
,
''
she
*NL*
cried
,
raising
her
streaming
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
me
poor
Mary
,
''
sobbed
the
woman
in
black
.
With
low
,
coddling
*NL*
cries
,
she
sank
on
her
knees
by
the
mourner
's
chair
,
and
put
her
arms
*NL*
about
her
.
The
other
women
began
to
groan
in
different
keys
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yer
poor
misguided
chil
'
is
gone
now
,
Mary
,
an

let

hope

*NL*
badness

She
's
gone
where
her
ter
`
ble
sins
will
be
judged
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
in
black
raised
her
face
and
paused
.
The
inevitable
sunlight
*NL*
came
streaming
in
at
the
windows
and
shed
a
ghastly
cheerfulness
upon
*NL*
the
faded
hues
of
the
room
.
Two
or
three
of
the
spectators
were
*NL*
sniffling
,
and
one
was
loudly
weeping
.
The
mourner
arose
and
staggered
*NL*
into
the
other
room
.
In
a
moment
she
emerged
with
a
pair
of
faded
baby
*NL*
shoes
held
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
kin
remember
when
she
used
to
wear
dem
,
''
cried
she
.
The
women
burst
*NL*
anew
into
cries
as
if
they
had
all
been
stabbed
.
The
mourner
turned
to
*NL*
the
soiled
and
unshaven
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Jimmie
,
boy
,
go
git
yer
sister
!
Go
git
yer
sister
an
'
we
'll
put

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dey
wo

''
said
the
man
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
git
yer
sister
,
Jimmie
,
''
shrieked
the
woman
,
confronting
him
*NL*
fiercely
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
man
swore
sullenly
.
He
went
over
to
a
corner
and
slowly
began
to
*NL*
put
on
his
coat
.
He
took
his
hat
and
went
out
,
with
a
dragging
,
*NL*
reluctant
step
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
woman
in
black
came
forward
and
again
besought
the
mourner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
'll
fergive
her

Mary
!
Yeh
'll
fergive

Her
*NL*
life

a
curse

her
days

*NL*
girl

She
's
gone
where
her

will
be
judged

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
gone
where
her
sins
will
be
judged
,
''
cried
the
other
women
,
like
*NL*
a
choir
at
a
funeral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deh
Lord
gives
and
deh
Lord
takes
away
,
''
said
the
woman
in
black
,
*NL*
raising
her
eyes
to
the
sunbeams
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Deh
Lord
gives
and
deh
Lord

,
''
responded
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
'll
fergive
her
,
Mary
!
''
pleaded
the
woman
in
black
.
The
mourner
*NL*
essayed
to
speak
but
her
voice
gave
way
.
She
shook
her
great
shoulders
*NL*
frantically
,
in
an
agony
of
grief
.
Hot
tears
seemed
to
scald
her
*NL*
quivering
face
.
Finally
her
voice
came
and
arose
like
a
scream
of
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
yes
,
I
'll
fergive
her
!
I
'll
fergive
her
