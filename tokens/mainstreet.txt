MAIN
STREET
*NL*

By

To

and

This
is
America
--
a
town
of
a
few
thousand
,
in
a
region
of
wheat
and
corn
*NL*
and
dairies
and
little
groves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
is
,
in
our
tale
,
called
``
Gopher
Prairie
,
Minnesota
.
''
But
its
*NL*
Main
Street
is
the
continuation
of
Main
Streets
everywhere
.
The
story
*NL*
would
be
the
same
in
Ohio
or
Montana
,
in
Kansas
or
Kentucky
or
Illinois
,
*NL*
and
not
very
differently
would
it
be
told
Up
York
State
or
in
the
*NL*
Carolina
hills
.
*NL*
*NL*
Main
Street
is
the
climax
of
civilization
.
That
this
Ford
car
might
*NL*
stand
in
front
of
the
Bon
Ton
Store
,
Hannibal
invaded
Rome
and
Erasmus
*NL*
wrote
in
Oxford
cloisters
.
What
Ole
Jenson
the
grocer
says
to
Ezra
*NL*
Stowbody
the
banker
is
the
new
law
for
London
,
Prague
,
and
the
*NL*
unprofitable
isles
of
the
sea
;
whatsoever
Ezra
does
not
know
and
*NL*
sanction
,
that
thing
is
heresy
,
worthless
for
knowing
and
wicked
to
*NL*
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
Our
railway
station
is
the
final
aspiration
of
architecture
.
Sam
*NL*
Clark
's
annual
hardware
turnover
is
the
envy
of
the
four
counties
which
*NL*
constitute
God
's
Country
.
In
the
sensitive
art
of
the
Rosebud
Movie
*NL*
Palace
there
is
a
Message
,
and
humor
strictly
moral
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
is
our
comfortable
tradition
and
sure
faith
.
Would
he
not
betray
*NL*
himself
an
alien
cynic
who
should
otherwise
portray
Main
Street
,
or
*NL*
distress
the
citizens
by
speculating
whether
there
may
not
be
other
*NL*
faiths
?

CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
ON
a
hill
by
the
Mississippi
where
Chippewas
camped
two
generations
ago
,
*NL*
a
girl
stood
in
relief
against
the
cornflower
blue
of
Northern
sky
.
*NL*
She
saw
no
Indians
now
;
she
saw
flour-mills
and
the
blinking
windows
of
*NL*
skyscrapers
in
Minneapolis
and
St.
Paul
.
Nor
was
she
thinking
of
squaws
*NL*
and
portages
,
and
the
Yankee
fur-traders
whose
shadows
were
all
about
*NL*
her
.
She
was
meditating
upon
walnut
fudge
,
the
plays
of
Brieux
,
the
*NL*
reasons
why
heels
run
over
,
and
the
fact
that
the
chemistry
instructor
*NL*
had
stared
at
the
new
coiffure
which
concealed
her
ears
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
breeze
which
had
crossed
a
thousand
miles
of
wheat-lands
bellied
her
*NL*
taffeta
skirt
in
a
line
so
graceful
,
so
full
of
animation
and
moving
*NL*
beauty
,
that
the
heart
of
a
chance
watcher
on
the
lower
road
tightened
*NL*
to
wistfulness
over
her
quality
of
suspended
freedom
.
She
lifted
her
*NL*
arms
,
she
leaned
back
against
the
wind
,
her
skirt
dipped
and
flared
,
a
*NL*
lock
blew
wild
.
A
girl
on
a
hilltop
;
credulous
,
plastic
,
young
;
drinking
*NL*
the
air
as
she
longed
to
drink
life
.
The
eternal
aching
comedy
of
*NL*
expectant
youth
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
Carol
Milford
,
fleeing
for
an
hour
from
Blodgett
College
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
days
of
pioneering
,
of
lassies
in
sunbonnets
,
and
bears
killed
with
*NL*
axes
in
piney
clearings
,
are
deader
now
than
Camelot
;
and
a
rebellious
*NL*
girl
is
the
spirit
of
that
bewildered
empire
called
the
American
*NL*
Middlewest
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Blodgett
College
is
on
the
edge
of
Minneapolis
.
It
is
a
bulwark
of
sound
*NL*
religion
.
It
is
still
combating
the
recent
heresies
of
Voltaire
,
Darwin
,
*NL*
and
Robert
Ingersoll
.
Pious
families
in
Minnesota
,
Iowa
,
Wisconsin
,
the
*NL*
Dakotas
send
their
children
thither
,
and
Blodgett
protects
them
from
the
*NL*
wickedness
of
the
universities
.
But
it
secretes
friendly
girls
,
young
*NL*
men
who
sing
,
and
one
lady
instructress
who
really
likes
Milton
and
*NL*
Carlyle
.
So
the
four
years
which
Carol
spent
at
Blodgett
were
not
*NL*
altogether
wasted
.
The
smallness
of
the
school
,
the
fewness
of
rivals
,
*NL*
permitted
her
to
experiment
with
her
perilous
versatility
.
She
played
*NL*
tennis
,
gave
chafing-dish
parties
,
took
a
graduate
seminar
in
the
drama
,
*NL*
went
``
twosing
,
''
and
joined
half
a
dozen
societies
for
the
practise
of
*NL*
the
arts
or
the
tense
stalking
of
a
thing
called
General
Culture
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
class
there
were
two
or
three
prettier
girls
,
but
none
more
*NL*
eager
.
She
was
noticeable
equally
in
the
classroom
grind
and
at
dances
,
*NL*
though
out
of
the
three
hundred
students
of
Blodgett
,
scores
recited
*NL*
more
accurately
and
dozens
Bostoned
more
smoothly
.
Every
cell
of
her
*NL*
body
was
alive
--
thin
wrists
,
quince-blossom
skin
,
ingenue
eyes
,
black
*NL*
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
girls
in
her
dormitory
marveled
at
the
slightness
of
her
*NL*
body
when
they
saw
her
in
sheer
negligee
,
or
darting
out
wet
from
a
*NL*
shower-bath
.
She
seemed
then
but
half
as
large
as
they
had
supposed
;
*NL*
a
fragile
child
who
must
be
cloaked
with
understanding
kindness
.
*NL*
``
Psychic
,
''
the
girls
whispered
,
and
``
spiritual
.
''
Yet
so
radioactive
*NL*
were
her
nerves
,
so
adventurous
her
trust
in
rather
vaguely
conceived
*NL*
sweetness
and
light
,
that
she
was
more
energetic
than
any
of
the
hulking
*NL*
young
women
who
,
with
calves
bulging
in
heavy-ribbed
woolen
stockings
*NL*
beneath
decorous
blue
serge
bloomers
,
thuddingly
galloped
across
the
*NL*
floor
of
the
``
gym
''
in
practise
for
the
Blodgett
Ladies
'
Basket-Ball
*NL*
Team
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
when
she
was
tired
her
dark
eyes
were
observant
.
She
did
not
yet
*NL*
know
the
immense
ability
of
the
world
to
be
casually
cruel
and
proudly
*NL*
dull
,
but
if
she
should
ever
learn
those
dismaying
powers
,
her
eyes
*NL*
would
never
become
sullen
or
heavy
or
rheumily
amorous
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
all
her
enthusiasms
,
for
all
the
fondness
and
the
``
crushes
''
which
*NL*
she
inspired
,
Carol
's
acquaintances
were
shy
of
her
.
When
she
was
most
*NL*
ardently
singing
hymns
or
planning
deviltry
she
yet
seemed
gently
aloof
*NL*
and
critical
.
She
was
credulous
,
perhaps
;
a
born
hero-worshipper
;
yet
*NL*
she
did
question
and
examine
unceasingly
.
Whatever
she
might
become
she
*NL*
would
never
be
static
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
versatility
ensnared
her
.
By
turns
she
hoped
to
discover
that
she
*NL*
had
an
unusual
voice
,
a
talent
for
the
piano
,
the
ability
to
act
,
to
*NL*
write
,
to
manage
organizations
.
Always
she
was
disappointed
,
but
always
*NL*
she
effervesced
anew
--
over
the
Student
Volunteers
,
who
intended
to
*NL*
become
missionaries
,
over
painting
scenery
for
the
dramatic
club
,
over
*NL*
soliciting
advertisements
for
the
college
magazine
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
on
the
peak
that
Sunday
afternoon
when
she
played
in
chapel
.
*NL*
Out
of
the
dusk
her
violin
took
up
the
organ
theme
,
and
the
candle-light
*NL*
revealed
her
in
a
straight
golden
frock
,
her
arm
arched
to
the
bow
,
her
*NL*
lips
serious
.
Every
man
fell
in
love
then
with
religion
and
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Throughout
Senior
year
she
anxiously
related
all
her
experiments
and
*NL*
partial
successes
to
a
career
.
Daily
,
on
the
library
steps
or
in
the
*NL*
hall
of
the
Main
Building
,
the
co-eds
talked
of
``
What
shall
we
do
when
*NL*
we
finish
college
?
''
Even
the
girls
who
knew
that
they
were
going
to
be
*NL*
married
pretended
to
be
considering
important
business
positions
;
*NL*
even
they
who
knew
that
they
would
have
to
work
hinted
about
fabulous
*NL*
suitors
.
As
for
Carol
,
she
was
an
orphan
;
her
only
near
relative
was
a
*NL*
vanilla-flavored
sister
married
to
an
optician
in
St.
Paul
.
She
had
used
*NL*
most
of
the
money
from
her
father
's
estate
.
She
was
not
in
love
--
that
*NL*
is
,
not
often
,
nor
ever
long
at
a
time
.
She
would
earn
her
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
how
she
was
to
earn
it
,
how
she
was
to
conquer
the
world
--
almost
*NL*
entirely
for
the
world
's
own
good
--
she
did
not
see
.
Most
of
the
girls
*NL*
who
were
not
betrothed
meant
to
be
teachers
.
Of
these
there
were
two
*NL*
sorts
:
careless
young
women
who
admitted
that
they
intended
to
leave
the
*NL*
``
beastly
classroom
and
grubby
children
''
the
minute
they
had
a
chance
to
*NL*
marry
;
and
studious
,
sometimes
bulbous-browed
and
pop-eyed
maidens
who
*NL*
at
class
prayer-meetings
requested
God
to
``
guide
their
feet
along
the
*NL*
paths
of
greatest
usefulness
.
''
Neither
sort
tempted
Carol
.
The
former
*NL*
seemed
insincere
-LRB-
a
favorite
word
of
hers
at
this
era
-RRB-
.
The
earnest
*NL*
virgins
were
,
she
fancied
,
as
likely
to
do
harm
as
to
do
good
by
their
*NL*
faith
in
the
value
of
parsing
Caesar
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
various
times
during
Senior
year
Carol
finally
decided
upon
studying
*NL*
law
,
writing
motion-picture
scenarios
,
professional
nursing
,
and
*NL*
marrying
an
unidentified
hero
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
found
a
hobby
in
sociology
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sociology
instructor
was
new
.
He
was
married
,
and
therefore
taboo
,
*NL*
but
he
had
come
from
Boston
,
he
had
lived
among
poets
and
socialists
and
*NL*
Jews
and
millionaire
uplifters
at
the
University
Settlement
in
New
*NL*
York
,
and
he
had
a
beautiful
white
strong
neck
.
He
led
a
giggling
class
*NL*
through
the
prisons
,
the
charity
bureaus
,
the
employment
agencies
of
*NL*
Minneapolis
and
St.
Paul
.
Trailing
at
the
end
of
the
line
Carol
was
*NL*
indignant
at
the
prodding
curiosity
of
the
others
,
their
manner
of
*NL*
staring
at
the
poor
as
at
a
Zoo
.
She
felt
herself
a
great
liberator
.
*NL*
She
put
her
hand
to
her
mouth
,
her
forefinger
and
thumb
quite
painfully
*NL*
pinching
her
lower
lip
,
and
frowned
,
and
enjoyed
being
aloof
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
classmate
named
Stewart
Snyder
,
a
competent
bulky
young
man
in
a
gray
*NL*
flannel
shirt
,
a
rusty
black
bow
tie
,
and
the
green-and-purple
class
*NL*
cap
,
grumbled
to
her
as
they
walked
behind
the
others
in
the
muck
of
the
*NL*
South
St.
Paul
stockyards
,
``
These
college
chumps
make
me
tired
.
They
're
*NL*
so
top-lofty
.
They
ought
to
of
worked
on
the
farm
,
the
way
I
have
.
These
*NL*
workmen
put
it
all
over
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
love
common
workmen
,
''
glowed
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Only
you
do
n't
want
to
forget
that
common
workmen
do
n't
think
they
're
*NL*
common
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
right
!
I
apologize
!
''
Carol
's
brows
lifted
in
the
astonishment
of
*NL*
emotion
,
in
a
glory
of
abasement
.
Her
eyes
mothered
the
world
.
Stewart
*NL*
Snyder
peered
at
her
.
He
rammed
his
large
red
fists
into
his
pockets
,
*NL*
he
jerked
them
out
,
he
resolutely
got
rid
of
them
by
clenching
his
hands
*NL*
behind
him
,
and
he
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
You
_
get
_
people
.
Most
of
these
darn
co-eds
--
Say
,
Carol
,
you
*NL*
could
do
a
lot
for
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
--
oh
well
--
you
know
--
sympathy
and
everything
--
if
you
were
--
say
you
*NL*
were
a
lawyer
's
wife
.
You
'd
understand
his
clients
.
I
'm
going
to
be
a
*NL*
lawyer
.
I
admit
I
fall
down
in
sympathy
sometimes
.
I
get
so
dog-gone
*NL*
impatient
with
people
that
ca
n't
stand
the
gaff
.
You
'd
be
good
for
*NL*
a
fellow
that
was
too
serious
.
Make
him
more
--
more
--
YOU
*NL*
know
--
sympathetic
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
slightly
pouting
lips
,
his
mastiff
eyes
,
were
begging
her
to
beg
him
*NL*
to
go
on
.
She
fled
from
the
steam-roller
of
his
sentiment
.
She
cried
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
see
those
poor
sheep
--
millions
and
millions
of
them
.
''
She
darted
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stewart
was
not
interesting
.
He
had
n't
a
shapely
white
neck
,
and
he
had
*NL*
never
lived
among
celebrated
reformers
.
She
wanted
,
just
now
,
to
have
*NL*
a
cell
in
a
settlement-house
,
like
a
nun
without
the
bother
of
a
black
*NL*
robe
,
and
be
kind
,
and
read
Bernard
Shaw
,
and
enormously
improve
a
horde
*NL*
of
grateful
poor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
supplementary
reading
in
sociology
led
her
to
a
book
on
*NL*
village-improvement
--
tree-planting
,
town
pageants
,
girls
'
clubs
.
It
*NL*
had
pictures
of
greens
and
garden-walls
in
France
,
New
England
,
*NL*
Pennsylvania
.
She
had
picked
it
up
carelessly
,
with
a
slight
yawn
which
*NL*
she
patted
down
with
her
finger-tips
as
delicately
as
a
cat
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dipped
into
the
book
,
lounging
on
her
window-seat
,
with
her
slim
,
*NL*
lisle-stockinged
legs
crossed
,
and
her
knees
up
under
her
chin
.
*NL*
She
stroked
a
satin
pillow
while
she
read
.
About
her
was
the
clothy
*NL*
exuberance
of
a
Blodgett
College
room
:
cretonne-covered
window-seat
,
*NL*
photographs
of
girls
,
a
carbon
print
of
the
Coliseum
,
a
chafing-dish
,
*NL*
and
a
dozen
pillows
embroidered
or
beaded
or
pyrographed
.
Shockingly
out
*NL*
of
place
was
a
miniature
of
the
Dancing
Bacchante
.
It
was
the
only
trace
*NL*
of
Carol
in
the
room
.
She
had
inherited
the
rest
from
generations
of
*NL*
girl
students
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
as
a
part
of
all
this
commonplaceness
that
she
regarded
the
*NL*
treatise
on
village-improvement
.
But
she
suddenly
stopped
fidgeting
.
She
*NL*
strode
into
the
book
.
She
had
fled
half-way
through
it
before
the
three
*NL*
o'clock
bell
called
her
to
the
class
in
English
history
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
,
``
That
's
what
I
'll
do
after
college
!
I
'll
get
my
hands
on
*NL*
one
of
these
prairie
towns
and
make
it
beautiful
.
Be
an
inspiration
.
I
*NL*
suppose
I
'd
better
become
a
teacher
then
,
but
--
I
wo
n't
be
that
kind
of
*NL*
a
teacher
.
I
wo
n't
drone
.
Why
should
they
have
all
the
garden
suburbs
*NL*
on
Long
Island
?
Nobody
has
done
anything
with
the
ugly
towns
here
in
the
*NL*
Northwest
except
hold
revivals
and
build
libraries
to
contain
the
Elsie
*NL*
books
.
I
'll
make
'em
put
in
a
village
green
,
and
darling
cottages
,
and
a
*NL*
quaint
Main
Street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
triumphed
through
the
class
,
which
was
a
typical
Blodgett
*NL*
contest
between
a
dreary
teacher
and
unwilling
children
of
twenty
,
won
*NL*
by
the
teacher
because
his
opponents
had
to
answer
his
questions
,
while
*NL*
their
treacherous
queries
he
could
counter
by
demanding
,
``
Have
you
*NL*
looked
that
up
in
the
library
?
Well
then
,
suppose
you
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
history
instructor
was
a
retired
minister
.
He
was
sarcastic
today
.
*NL*
He
begged
of
sporting
young
Mr.
Charley
Holmberg
,
``
Now
Charles
,
would
it
*NL*
interrupt
your
undoubtedly
fascinating
pursuit
of
that
malevolent
fly
*NL*
if
I
were
to
ask
you
to
tell
us
that
you
do
not
know
anything
about
King
*NL*
John
?
''
He
spent
three
delightful
minutes
in
assuring
himself
of
the
fact
*NL*
that
no
one
exactly
remembered
the
date
of
Magna
Charta
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
not
hear
him
.
She
was
completing
the
roof
of
a
half-timbered
*NL*
town
hall
.
She
had
found
one
man
in
the
prairie
village
who
did
not
*NL*
appreciate
her
picture
of
winding
streets
and
arcades
,
but
she
had
*NL*
assembled
the
town
council
and
dramatically
defeated
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
was
Minnesota-born
Carol
was
not
an
intimate
of
the
prairie
*NL*
villages
.
Her
father
,
the
smiling
and
shabby
,
the
learned
and
teasingly
*NL*
kind
,
had
come
from
Massachusetts
,
and
through
all
her
childhood
he
*NL*
had
been
a
judge
in
Mankato
,
which
is
not
a
prairie
town
,
but
in
its
*NL*
garden-sheltered
streets
and
aisles
of
elms
is
white
and
green
New
*NL*
England
reborn
.
Mankato
lies
between
cliffs
and
the
Minnesota
River
,
*NL*
hard
by
Traverse
des
Sioux
,
where
the
first
settlers
made
treaties
*NL*
with
the
Indians
,
and
the
cattle-rustlers
once
came
galloping
before
*NL*
hell-for-leather
posses
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
climbed
along
the
banks
of
the
dark
river
Carol
listened
to
its
*NL*
fables
about
the
wide
land
of
yellow
waters
and
bleached
buffalo
bones
*NL*
to
the
West
;
the
Southern
levees
and
singing
darkies
and
palm
trees
*NL*
toward
which
it
was
forever
mysteriously
gliding
;
and
she
heard
again
*NL*
the
startled
bells
and
thick
puffing
of
high-stacked
river
steamers
*NL*
wrecked
on
sand-reefs
sixty
years
ago
.
Along
the
decks
she
saw
*NL*
missionaries
,
gamblers
in
tall
pot
hats
,
and
Dakota
chiefs
with
scarlet
*NL*
blankets
...
Far
off
whistles
at
night
,
round
the
river
bend
,
*NL*
plunking
paddles
reechoed
by
the
pines
,
and
a
glow
on
black
sliding
*NL*
waters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
family
were
self-sufficient
in
their
inventive
life
,
with
*NL*
Christmas
a
rite
full
of
surprises
and
tenderness
,
and
``
dressing-up
*NL*
parties
''
spontaneous
and
joyously
absurd
.
The
beasts
in
the
Milford
*NL*
hearth-mythology
were
not
the
obscene
Night
Animals
who
jump
out
*NL*
of
closets
and
eat
little
girls
,
but
beneficent
and
bright-eyed
*NL*
creatures
--
the
tam
htab
,
who
is
woolly
and
blue
and
lives
in
the
*NL*
bathroom
,
and
runs
rapidly
to
warm
small
feet
;
the
ferruginous
oil
*NL*
stove
,
who
purrs
and
knows
stories
;
and
the
skitamarigg
,
who
will
play
*NL*
with
children
before
breakfast
if
they
spring
out
of
bed
and
close
the
*NL*
window
at
the
very
first
line
of
the
song
about
puellas
which
father
*NL*
sings
while
shaving
.
*NL*
*NL*
Judge
Milford
's
pedagogical
scheme
was
to
let
the
children
read
whatever
*NL*
they
pleased
,
and
in
his
brown
library
Carol
absorbed
Balzac
and
*NL*
Rabelais
and
Thoreau
and
Max
Muller
.
He
gravely
taught
them
the
letters
*NL*
on
the
backs
of
the
encyclopedias
,
and
when
polite
visitors
asked
about
*NL*
the
mental
progress
of
the
``
little
ones
,
''
they
were
horrified
to
hear
*NL*
the
children
earnestly
repeating
A-And
,
And-Aus
,
Aus-Bis
,
Bis-Cal
,
*NL*
Cal-Cha
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
mother
died
when
she
was
nine
.
Her
father
retired
from
the
*NL*
judiciary
when
she
was
eleven
,
and
took
the
family
to
Minneapolis
.
There
*NL*
he
died
,
two
years
after
.
Her
sister
,
a
busy
proper
advisory
soul
,
older
*NL*
than
herself
,
had
become
a
stranger
to
her
even
when
they
lived
in
the
*NL*
same
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
those
early
brown
and
silver
days
and
from
her
independence
of
*NL*
relatives
Carol
retained
a
willingness
to
be
different
from
brisk
*NL*
efficient
book-ignoring
people
;
an
instinct
to
observe
and
wonder
*NL*
at
their
bustle
even
when
she
was
taking
part
in
it
.
But
,
she
felt
*NL*
approvingly
,
as
she
discovered
her
career
of
town-planning
,
she
was
now
*NL*
roused
to
being
brisk
and
efficient
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
month
Carol
's
ambition
had
clouded
.
Her
hesitancy
about
becoming
a
*NL*
teacher
had
returned
.
She
was
not
,
she
worried
,
strong
enough
to
endure
*NL*
the
routine
,
and
she
could
not
picture
herself
standing
before
grinning
*NL*
children
and
pretending
to
be
wise
and
decisive
.
But
the
desire
for
*NL*
the
creation
of
a
beautiful
town
remained
.
When
she
encountered
an
item
*NL*
about
small-town
women
's
clubs
or
a
photograph
of
a
straggling
Main
*NL*
Street
,
she
was
homesick
for
it
,
she
felt
robbed
of
her
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
advice
of
the
professor
of
English
which
led
her
to
study
*NL*
professional
library-work
in
a
Chicago
school
.
Her
imagination
carved
*NL*
and
colored
the
new
plan
.
She
saw
herself
persuading
children
to
read
*NL*
charming
fairy
tales
,
helping
young
men
to
find
books
on
mechanics
,
*NL*
being
ever
so
courteous
to
old
men
who
were
hunting
for
newspapers
--
the
*NL*
light
of
the
library
,
an
authority
on
books
,
invited
to
dinners
with
*NL*
poets
and
explorers
,
reading
a
paper
to
an
association
of
distinguished
*NL*
scholars
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
faculty
reception
before
commencement
.
In
five
days
they
would
*NL*
be
in
the
cyclone
of
final
examinations
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
house
of
the
president
had
been
massed
with
palms
suggestive
of
*NL*
polite
undertaking
parlors
,
and
in
the
library
,
a
ten-foot
room
with
a
*NL*
globe
and
the
portraits
of
Whittier
and
Martha
Washington
,
the
student
*NL*
orchestra
was
playing
``
Carmen
''
and
``
Madame
Butterfly
.
''
Carol
was
dizzy
*NL*
with
music
and
the
emotions
of
parting
.
She
saw
the
palms
as
a
jungle
,
*NL*
the
pink-shaded
electric
globes
as
an
opaline
haze
,
and
the
eye-glassed
*NL*
faculty
as
Olympians
.
She
was
melancholy
at
sight
of
the
mousey
girls
*NL*
with
whom
she
had
``
always
intended
to
get
acquainted
,
''
and
the
half
*NL*
dozen
young
men
who
were
ready
to
fall
in
love
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
it
was
Stewart
Snyder
whom
she
encouraged
.
He
was
so
much
manlier
*NL*
than
the
others
;
he
was
an
even
warm
brown
,
like
his
new
ready-made
suit
*NL*
with
its
padded
shoulders
.
She
sat
with
him
,
and
with
two
cups
of
*NL*
coffee
and
a
chicken
patty
,
upon
a
pile
of
presidential
overshoes
in
the
*NL*
coat-closet
under
the
stairs
,
and
as
the
thin
music
seeped
in
,
Stewart
*NL*
whispered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
ca
n't
stand
it
,
this
breaking
up
after
four
years
!
The
happiest
years
*NL*
of
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
believed
it
.
``
Oh
,
I
know
!
To
think
that
in
just
a
few
days
we
'll
be
*NL*
parting
,
and
we
'll
never
see
some
of
the
bunch
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carol
,
you
got
to
listen
to
me
!
You
always
duck
when
I
try
to
talk
*NL*
seriously
to
you
,
but
you
got
to
listen
to
me
.
I
'm
going
to
be
a
big
*NL*
lawyer
,
maybe
a
judge
,
and
I
need
you
,
and
I
'd
protect
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
arm
slid
behind
her
shoulders
.
The
insinuating
music
drained
her
*NL*
independence
.
She
said
mournfully
,
``
Would
you
take
care
of
me
?
''
She
*NL*
touched
his
hand
.
It
was
warm
,
solid
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
I
would
!
We
'd
have
,
Lord
,
we
'd
have
bully
times
in
Yankton
,
*NL*
where
I
'm
going
to
settle
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
want
to
do
something
with
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
better
than
making
a
comfy
home
and
bringing
up
some
cute
kids
*NL*
and
knowing
nice
homey
people
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
immemorial
male
reply
to
the
restless
woman
.
Thus
to
the
*NL*
young
Sappho
spake
the
melon-venders
;
thus
the
captains
to
Zenobia
;
and
*NL*
in
the
damp
cave
over
gnawed
bones
the
hairy
suitor
thus
protested
to
*NL*
the
woman
advocate
of
matriarchy
.
In
the
dialect
of
Blodgett
College
but
*NL*
with
the
voice
of
Sappho
was
Carol
's
answer
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
.
I
know
.
I
suppose
that
's
so
.
Honestly
,
I
do
love
children
.
*NL*
But
there
's
lots
of
women
that
can
do
housework
,
but
I
--
well
,
if
you
*NL*
HAVE
got
a
college
education
,
you
ought
to
use
it
for
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
you
can
use
it
just
as
well
in
the
home
.
And
gee
,
Carol
,
*NL*
just
think
of
a
bunch
of
us
going
out
on
an
auto
picnic
,
some
nice
*NL*
spring
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
sleigh-riding
in
winter
,
and
going
fishing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Blarrrrrrr
!
The
orchestra
had
crashed
into
the
``
Soldiers
'
Chorus
''
;
and
*NL*
she
was
protesting
,
``
No
!
No
!
You
're
a
dear
,
but
I
want
to
do
things
.
*NL*
I
do
n't
understand
myself
but
I
want
--
everything
in
the
world
!
Maybe
I
*NL*
ca
n't
sing
or
write
,
but
I
know
I
can
be
an
influence
in
library
work
.
*NL*
Just
suppose
I
encouraged
some
boy
and
he
became
a
great
artist
!
I
*NL*
will
!
I
will
do
it
!
Stewart
dear
,
I
ca
n't
settle
down
to
nothing
but
*NL*
dish-washing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
minutes
later
--
two
hectic
minutes
--
they
were
disturbed
by
*NL*
an
embarrassed
couple
also
seeking
the
idyllic
seclusion
of
the
*NL*
overshoe-closet
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
graduation
she
never
saw
Stewart
Snyder
again
.
She
wrote
to
him
*NL*
once
a
week
--
for
one
month
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
year
Carol
spent
in
Chicago
.
Her
study
of
library-cataloguing
,
*NL*
recording
,
books
of
reference
,
was
easy
and
not
too
somniferous
.
She
*NL*
reveled
in
the
Art
Institute
,
in
symphonies
and
violin
recitals
and
*NL*
chamber
music
,
in
the
theater
and
classic
dancing
.
She
almost
gave
up
*NL*
library
work
to
become
one
of
the
young
women
who
dance
in
cheese-cloth
*NL*
in
the
moonlight
.
She
was
taken
to
a
certified
Studio
Party
,
with
*NL*
beer
,
cigarettes
,
bobbed
hair
,
and
a
Russian
Jewess
who
sang
the
*NL*
Internationale
.
It
can
not
be
reported
that
Carol
had
anything
*NL*
significant
to
say
to
the
Bohemians
.
She
was
awkward
with
them
,
and
*NL*
felt
ignorant
,
and
she
was
shocked
by
the
free
manners
which
she
had
for
*NL*
years
desired
.
But
she
heard
and
remembered
discussions
of
Freud
,
Romain
*NL*
Rolland
,
syndicalism
,
the
Confederation
Generale
du
Travail
,
feminism
*NL*
vs.
haremism
,
Chinese
lyrics
,
nationalization
of
mines
,
Christian
*NL*
Science
,
and
fishing
in
Ontario
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
home
,
and
that
was
the
beginning
and
end
of
her
Bohemian
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
cousin
of
Carol
's
sister
's
husband
lived
in
Winnetka
,
and
*NL*
once
invited
her
out
to
Sunday
dinner
.
She
walked
back
through
Wilmette
*NL*
and
Evanston
,
discovered
new
forms
of
suburban
architecture
,
and
*NL*
remembered
her
desire
to
recreate
villages
.
She
decided
that
she
would
*NL*
give
up
library
work
and
,
by
a
miracle
whose
nature
was
not
very
clearly
*NL*
revealed
to
her
,
turn
a
prairie
town
into
Georgian
houses
and
Japanese
*NL*
bungalows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
in
library
class
she
had
to
read
a
theme
on
the
use
of
the
*NL*
Cumulative
Index
,
and
she
was
taken
so
seriously
in
the
discussion
that
*NL*
she
put
off
her
career
of
town-planning
--
and
in
the
autumn
she
was
in
*NL*
the
public
library
of
St.
Paul
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
not
unhappy
and
she
was
not
exhilarated
,
in
the
St.
Paul
*NL*
Library
.
She
slowly
confessed
that
she
was
not
visibly
affecting
lives
.
*NL*
She
did
,
at
first
,
put
into
her
contact
with
the
patrons
a
willingness
*NL*
which
should
have
moved
worlds
.
But
so
few
of
these
stolid
worlds
wanted
*NL*
to
be
moved
.
When
she
was
in
charge
of
the
magazine
room
the
readers
did
*NL*
not
ask
for
suggestions
about
elevated
essays
.
They
grunted
,
``
Wanta
find
*NL*
the
Leather
Goods
Gazette
for
last
February
.
''
When
she
was
giving
*NL*
out
books
the
principal
query
was
,
``
Can
you
tell
me
of
a
good
,
light
,
*NL*
exciting
love
story
to
read
?
My
husband
's
going
away
for
a
week
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fond
of
the
other
librarians
;
proud
of
their
aspirations
.
And
by
*NL*
the
chance
of
propinquity
she
read
scores
of
books
unnatural
to
her
gay
*NL*
white
littleness
:
volumes
of
anthropology
with
ditches
of
foot-notes
*NL*
filled
with
heaps
of
small
dusty
type
,
Parisian
imagistes
,
Hindu
recipes
*NL*
for
curry
,
voyages
to
the
Solomon
Isles
,
theosophy
with
modern
American
*NL*
improvements
,
treatises
upon
success
in
the
real-estate
business
.
She
*NL*
took
walks
,
and
was
sensible
about
shoes
and
diet
.
And
never
did
she
*NL*
feel
that
she
was
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
dances
and
suppers
at
the
houses
of
college
acquaintances
.
*NL*
Sometimes
she
one-stepped
demurely
;
sometimes
,
in
dread
of
life
's
*NL*
slipping
past
,
she
turned
into
a
bacchanal
,
her
tender
eyes
excited
,
her
*NL*
throat
tense
,
as
she
slid
down
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
her
three
years
of
library
work
several
men
showed
diligent
*NL*
interest
in
her
--
the
treasurer
of
a
fur-manufacturing
firm
,
a
teacher
,
a
*NL*
newspaper
reporter
,
and
a
petty
railroad
official
.
None
of
them
made
her
*NL*
more
than
pause
in
thought
.
For
months
no
male
emerged
from
the
mass
.
*NL*
Then
,
at
the
Marburys
'
,
she
met
Dr.
Will
Kennicott
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
IT
was
a
frail
and
blue
and
lonely
Carol
who
trotted
to
the
flat
of
the
*NL*
Johnson
Marburys
for
Sunday
evening
supper
.
Mrs.
Marbury
was
a
neighbor
*NL*
and
friend
of
Carol
's
sister
;
Mr.
Marbury
a
traveling
representative
of
*NL*
an
insurance
company
.
They
made
a
specialty
of
sandwich-salad-coffee
*NL*
lap
suppers
,
and
they
regarded
Carol
as
their
literary
and
artistic
*NL*
representative
.
She
was
the
one
who
could
be
depended
upon
to
appreciate
*NL*
the
Caruso
phonograph
record
,
and
the
Chinese
lantern
which
Mr.
Marbury
*NL*
had
brought
back
as
his
present
from
San
Francisco
.
Carol
found
the
*NL*
Marburys
admiring
and
therefore
admirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
September
Sunday
evening
she
wore
a
net
frock
with
a
pale
pink
*NL*
lining
.
A
nap
had
soothed
away
the
faint
lines
of
tiredness
beside
her
*NL*
eyes
.
She
was
young
,
naive
,
stimulated
by
the
coolness
.
She
flung
*NL*
her
coat
at
the
chair
in
the
hall
of
the
flat
,
and
exploded
into
*NL*
the
green-plush
living-room
.
The
familiar
group
were
trying
to
be
*NL*
conversational
.
She
saw
Mr.
Marbury
,
a
woman
teacher
of
gymnastics
in
*NL*
a
high
school
,
a
chief
clerk
from
the
Great
Northern
Railway
offices
,
*NL*
a
young
lawyer
.
But
there
was
also
a
stranger
,
a
thick
tall
man
of
*NL*
thirty-six
or
-
seven
,
with
stolid
brown
hair
,
lips
used
to
giving
*NL*
orders
,
eyes
which
followed
everything
good-naturedly
,
and
clothes
which
*NL*
you
could
never
quite
remember
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Marbury
boomed
,
``
Carol
,
come
over
here
and
meet
Doc
Kennicott
--
Dr.
*NL*
Will
Kennicott
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
He
does
all
our
insurance-examining
up
*NL*
in
that
neck
of
the
woods
,
and
they
do
say
he
's
some
doctor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
edged
toward
the
stranger
and
murmured
nothing
in
particular
,
*NL*
Carol
remembered
that
Gopher
Prairie
was
a
Minnesota
wheat-prairie
town
*NL*
of
something
over
three
thousand
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pleased
to
meet
you
,
''
stated
Dr.
Kennicott
.
His
hand
was
strong
;
the
*NL*
palm
soft
,
but
the
back
weathered
,
showing
golden
hairs
against
firm
red
*NL*
skin
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
as
though
she
was
an
agreeable
discovery
.
She
tugged
*NL*
her
hand
free
and
fluttered
,
``
I
must
go
out
to
the
kitchen
and
help
Mrs.
*NL*
Marbury
.
''
She
did
not
speak
to
him
again
till
,
after
she
had
heated
*NL*
the
rolls
and
passed
the
paper
napkins
,
Mr.
Marbury
captured
her
with
*NL*
a
loud
,
``
Oh
,
quit
fussing
now
.
Come
over
here
and
sit
down
and
tell
*NL*
us
how
's
tricks
.
''
He
herded
her
to
a
sofa
with
Dr.
Kennicott
,
who
was
*NL*
rather
vague
about
the
eyes
,
rather
drooping
of
bulky
shoulder
,
as
*NL*
though
he
was
wondering
what
he
was
expected
to
do
next
.
As
their
host
*NL*
left
them
,
Kennicott
awoke
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Marbury
tells
me
you
're
a
high
mogul
in
the
public
library
.
I
was
*NL*
surprised
.
Did
n't
hardly
think
you
were
old
enough
.
I
thought
you
were
a
*NL*
girl
,
still
in
college
maybe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
dreadfully
old
.
I
expect
to
take
to
a
lip-stick
,
and
to
find
a
*NL*
gray
hair
any
morning
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
You
must
be
frightfully
old
--
prob
`
ly
too
old
to
be
my
*NL*
granddaughter
,
I
guess
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
in
the
Vale
of
Arcady
nymph
and
satyr
beguiled
the
hours
;
precisely
*NL*
thus
,
and
not
in
honeyed
pentameters
,
discoursed
Elaine
and
the
worn
Sir
*NL*
Launcelot
in
the
pleached
alley
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
you
like
your
work
?
''
asked
the
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
pleasant
,
but
sometimes
I
feel
shut
off
from
things
--
the
steel
*NL*
stacks
,
and
the
everlasting
cards
smeared
all
over
with
red
rubber
*NL*
stamps

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
get
sick
of
the
city

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
St.
Paul
?
Why
,
do
n't
you
like
it
?
I
do
n't
know
of
any
lovelier
view
*NL*
than
when
you
stand
on
Summit
Avenue
and
look
across
Lower
Town
to
the
*NL*
Mississippi
cliffs
and
the
upland
farms
beyond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
but
--
Of
course
I
've
spent
nine
years
around
the
Twin
*NL*
Cities

took
my
B.A.
and
M.D.
over
at
the
U.

and
had
my
internship
in
a
*NL*
hospital
in
Minneapolis

still
,
oh
well

you
do
n't
get
to

you
do
up

I
feel
I
've
got
something
to
say
about
running

you
take
it
in
a
big
city
of
two-three
hundred

thousand

I
'm
just
one
flea
on
the

then
I
like

No

a
very
nice

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice

Say
honestly

Of
course
I
may
be
prejudiced

but
I
've
seen
an
*NL*
awful
lot
of
towns

one
time
I
went
to
Atlantic
City
for
the
American
*NL*
Medical
Association
meeting
,
and
I
spent
practically
a
week
in
New
York

But
I
never
saw
a
town
that
had
such
up-and-coming
people
as
Gopher

Bresnahan

you

the
famous
auto
manufacturer

comes

from
Gopher

Born

brought
up
there

it
's
a

pretty

town

Lots

fine

there
's
two
of
the

dandiest
lakes
you
ever
saw

right
near
town

And
we
've
got
seven
miles

of
cement

already

building
more

a

Dr.

launched
into
a
heavy
,

Oh

these
Dutch

All
they
need

*NL*
Carol
must
have
flinched
,
for
instantly
he
was
urging
,

I

I
do
n't
want
you
to

one

peddlers

case-hardened

me
that

*NL*
*NL*
After
his
remarks
upon
suffrage
he
abruptly
questioned
her
about
*NL*
herself
.
His
kindliness
and
the
firmness
of
his
personality
enveloped
*NL*
her
and
she
accepted
him
as
one
who
had
a
right
to
know
what
she
*NL*
thought
and
wore
and
ate
and
read
.
He
was
positive
.
He
had
grown
from
a
*NL*
sketched-in
stranger
to
a
friend
,
whose
gossip
was
important
news
.
She
*NL*
noticed
the
healthy
solidity
of
his
chest
.
His
nose
,
which
had
seemed
*NL*
irregular
and
large
,
was
suddenly
virile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
jarred
out
of
this
serious
sweetness
when
Marbury
bounced
over
*NL*
to
them
and
with
horrible
publicity
yammered
,
``
Say

what
do
you

Telling

did
not
have
another

until
their
parting
:

II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Of
the
love-making
of
Carol
and
Will
Kennicott
there
is
nothing
to
be
*NL*
told
which
may
not
be
heard
on
every
summer
evening
,
on
every
shadowy
*NL*
block
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
biology
and
mystery
;
their
speech
was
slang
phrases
and
flares
*NL*
of
poetry
;
their
silences
were
contentment
,
or
shaky
crises
when
his
arm
*NL*
took
her
shoulder
.
All
the
beauty
of
youth
,
first
discovered
when
it
*NL*
is
passing
--
and
all
the
commonplaceness
of
a
well-to-do
unmarried
man
*NL*
encountering
a
pretty
girl
at
the
time
when
she
is
slightly
weary
of
her
*NL*
employment
and
sees
no
glory
ahead
nor
any
man
she
is
glad
to
serve
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
liked
each
other
honestly
--
they
were
both
honest
.
She
was
*NL*
disappointed
by
his
devotion
to
making
money
,
but
she
was
sure
that
*NL*
he
did
not
lie
to
patients
,
and
that
he
did
keep
up
with
the
medical
*NL*
magazines
.
What
aroused
her
to
something
more
than
liking
was
his
*NL*
boyishness
when
they
went
tramping
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
from
St.
Paul
down
the
river
to
Mendota
,
Kennicott
more
*NL*
elastic-seeming
in
a
cap
and
a
soft
crepe
shirt
,
Carol
youthful
in
a
*NL*
tam-o
'
-
shanter
of
mole
velvet
,
a
blue
serge
suit
with
an
absurdly
and
*NL*
agreeably
broad
turn-down
linen
collar
,
and
frivolous
ankles
above
*NL*
athletic
shoes
.
The
High
Bridge
crosses
the
Mississippi
,
mounting
from
*NL*
low
banks
to
a
palisade
of
cliffs
.
Far
down
beneath
it
on
the
St.
Paul
*NL*
side
,
upon
mud
flats
,
is
a
wild
settlement
of
chicken-infested
gardens
*NL*
and
shanties
patched
together
from
discarded
sign-boards
,
sheets
of
*NL*
corrugated
iron
,
and
planks
fished
out
of
the
river
.
Carol
leaned
*NL*
over
the
rail
of
the
bridge
to
look
down
at
this
Yang-tse
village
;
*NL*
in
delicious
imaginary
fear
she
shrieked
that
she
was
dizzy
with
the
*NL*
height
;
and
it
was
an
extremely
human
satisfaction
to
have
a
strong
male
*NL*
snatch
her
back
to
safety
,
instead
of
having
a
logical
woman
teacher
or
*NL*
librarian
sniff
,
``
Well
,
if
you
're
scared
,
why
do
n't
you
get
away
from
*NL*
the
rail
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
cliffs
across
the
river
Carol
and
Kennicott
looked
back
at
St.
*NL*
Paul
on
its
hills
;
an
imperial
sweep
from
the
dome
of
the
cathedral
to
*NL*
the
dome
of
the
state
capitol
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
river
road
led
past
rocky
field
slopes
,
deep
glens
,
woods
flamboyant
*NL*
now
with
September
,
to
Mendota
,
white
walls
and
a
spire
among
trees
*NL*
beneath
a
hill
,
old-world
in
its
placid
ease
.
And
for
this
fresh
land
,
*NL*
the
place
is
ancient
.
Here
is
the
bold
stone
house
which
General
Sibley
,
*NL*
the
king
of
fur-traders
,
built
in
1835
,
with
plaster
of
river
mud
,
and
*NL*
ropes
of
twisted
grass
for
laths
.
It
has
an
air
of
centuries
.
In
its
*NL*
solid
rooms
Carol
and
Kennicott
found
prints
from
other
days
which
the
*NL*
house
had
seen
--
tail-coats
of
robin
's
-
egg
blue
,
clumsy
Red
River
carts
*NL*
laden
with
luxurious
furs
,
whiskered
Union
soldiers
in
slant
forage
caps
*NL*
and
rattling
sabers
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
suggested
to
them
a
common
American
past
,
and
it
was
memorable
*NL*
because
they
had
discovered
it
together
.
They
talked
more
trustingly
,
*NL*
more
personally
,
as
they
trudged
on
.
They
crossed
the
Minnesota
River
in
*NL*
a
rowboat
ferry
.
They
climbed
the
hill
to
the
round
stone
tower
of
Fort
*NL*
Snelling
.
They
saw
the
junction
of
the
Mississippi
and
the
Minnesota
,
*NL*
and
recalled
the
men
who
had
come
here
eighty
years
ago
--
Maine
*NL*
lumbermen
,
York
traders
,
soldiers
from
the
Maryland
hills
.

*NL*
``
It
's
a
good
country

I
'm
proud

make
it
all

those

They
sat
on
the
bank
below
the
parapet
of
the
old
fort

hidden
from

observation

He
circled
her
shoulder
with
his

Relaxed
after
the

walk

a
chill
nipping
her
throat

conscious

she

leaned

She

she
touched

She

was

it

a

she
discovered
that

Then
they
were
sitting
six
inches
apart

pretending
that
they
had
never

been
nearer

she
tried
to
be
impersonal

*NL*
*NL*
Her
cheek
near
his
sleeve
,
she
studied
a
dozen
village
pictures

They
*NL*
were
streaky
;
she
saw
only
trees

shrubbery
,
a
porch
indistinct
in
leafy
*NL*
shadows

But
she
exclaimed
over
the
lakes

dark
water
reflecting
wooded

bluffs

a
flight

ducks

a
fisherman
in
shirt
sleeves

a
wide
straw

hat

holding
up
a
string

croppies

One
winter
picture

the
edge

Plover

the
air

an
etching

lustrous
slide

ice

snow
in

the

a
boggy
bank

the
mound

a
muskrat
house

reeds
in

thin
black
lines

arches

It
was
an
impression

cool

clear
vigor

*NL*
*NL*
``

it

skate

A

In

UNDER

a

An

irritable
clank
and
rattle
beneath
a
prolonged
roar

The
sharp
scent
of
*NL*
oranges
cutting
the
soggy
smell
of
unbathed
people
and
ancient
baggage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Towns
as
planless
as
a
scattering
of
pasteboard
boxes
on

attic
floor

The

encircling
white

,
the
way
train
,
grumbling
through
Minnesota
,
imperceptibly
*NL*
climbing
the
giant
tableland
that
slopes
in
a
thousand-mile
rise
from
*NL*
hot
Mississippi
bottoms
to
the
Rockies
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
September
,
hot
,
very
dusty
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
no
smug
Pullman
attached
to
the
train
,
and
the
day
coaches
of
*NL*
the
East
are
replaced
by
free
chair
cars
,
with
each
seat
cut
into
two
*NL*
adjustable
plush
chairs
,
the
head-rests
covered
with
doubtful
linen
*NL*
towels
.
Halfway
down
the
car
is
a
semi-partition
of
carved
oak
columns
,
*NL*
but
the
aisle
is
of
bare
,
splintery
,
grease-blackened
wood
.
There
is
no
*NL*
porter
,
no
pillows
,
no
provision
for
beds
,
but
all
today
and
all
tonight
*NL*
they
will
ride
in
this
long
steel
box-farmers
with
perpetually
tired
*NL*
wives
and
children
who
seem
all
to
be
of
the
same
age
;
workmen
going
to
*NL*
new
jobs
;
traveling
salesmen
with
derbies
and
freshly
shined
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
are
parched
and
cramped
,
the
lines
of
their
hands
filled
with
*NL*
grime
;
they
go
to
sleep
curled
in
distorted
attitudes
,
heads
against
the
*NL*
window-panes
or
propped
on
rolled
coats
on
seat-arms
,
and
legs
thrust
*NL*
into
the
aisle
.
They
do
not
read
;
apparently
they
do
not
think
.
They
*NL*
wait
.
An
early-wrinkled
,
young-old
mother
,
moving
as
though
her
joints
*NL*
were
dry
,
opens
a
suit-case
in
which
are
seen
creased
blouses
,
a
pair
*NL*
of
slippers
worn
through
at
the
toes
,
a
bottle
of
patent
medicine
,
a
tin
*NL*
cup
,
a
paper-covered
book
about
dreams
which
the
news-butcher
has
coaxed
*NL*
her
into
buying
.
She
brings
out
a
graham
cracker
which
she
feeds
to
a
*NL*
baby
lying
flat
on
a
seat
and
wailing
hopelessly
.
Most
of
the
crumbs
*NL*
drop
on
the
red
plush
of
the
seat
,
and
the
woman
sighs
and
tries
to
*NL*
brush
them
away
,
but
they
leap
up
impishly
and
fall
back
on
the
plush
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
soiled
man
and
woman
munch
sandwiches
and
throw
the
crusts
on
the
*NL*
floor
.
A
large
brick-colored
Norwegian
takes
off
his
shoes
,
grunts
in
*NL*
relief
,
and
props
his
feet
in
their
thick
gray
socks
against
the
seat
in
*NL*
front
of
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
old
woman
whose
toothless
mouth
shuts
like
a
mud-turtle
's
,
and
whose
*NL*
hair
is
not
so
much
white
as
yellow
like
moldy
linen
,
with
bands
of
pink
*NL*
skull
apparent
between
the
tresses
,
anxiously
lifts
her
bag
,
opens
it
,
*NL*
peers
in
,
closes
it
,
puts
it
under
the
seat
,
and
hastily
picks
it
up
and
*NL*
opens
it
and
hides
it
all
over
again
.
The
bag
is
full
of
treasures
and
*NL*
of
memories
:
a
leather
buckle
,
an
ancient
band-concert
program
,
*NL*
scraps
of
ribbon
,
lace
,
satin
.
In
the
aisle
beside
her
is
an
extremely
*NL*
indignant
parrakeet
in
a
cage
.
*NL*
*NL*
Two
facing
seats
,
overflowing
with
a
Slovene
iron-miner
's
family
,
*NL*
are
littered
with
shoes
,
dolls
,
whisky
bottles
,
bundles
wrapped
in
*NL*
newspapers
,
a
sewing
bag
.
The
oldest
boy
takes
a
mouth-organ
out
of
his
*NL*
coat
pocket
,
wipes
the
tobacco
crumbs
off
,
and
plays
``
Marching
through
*NL*
Georgia
''
till
every
head
in
the
car
begins
to
ache
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
news-butcher
comes
through
selling
chocolate
bars
and
lemon
drops
.
*NL*
A
girl-child
ceaselessly
trots
down
to
the
water-cooler
and
back
to
her
*NL*
seat
.
The
stiff
paper
envelope
which
she
uses
for
cup
drips
in
the
aisle
*NL*
as
she
goes
,
and
on
each
trip
she
stumbles
over
the
feet
of
a
carpenter
,
*NL*
who
grunts
,
``
Ouch
!
Look
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
dust-caked
doors
are
open
,
and
from
the
smoking-car
drifts
back
a
*NL*
visible
blue
line
of
stinging
tobacco
smoke
,
and
with
it
a
crackle
of
*NL*
laughter
over
the
story
which
the
young
man
in
the
bright
blue
suit
and
*NL*
lavender
tie
and
light
yellow
shoes
has
just
told
to
the
squat
man
in
*NL*
garage
overalls
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
smell
grows
constantly
thicker
,
more
stale
.

*NL*
To
each
of
the
passengers
his
seat
was
his
temporary
home
,
and
most
of
*NL*
the
passengers
were
slatternly
housekeepers
.
But
one
seat
looked
clean
*NL*
and
deceptively
cool
.
In
it
were
an
obviously
prosperous
man
and
a
*NL*
black-haired
,
fine-skinned
girl
whose
pumps
rested
on
an
immaculate
*NL*
horsehide
bag
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
Dr.
Will
Kennicott
and
his
bride
,
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
been
married
at
the
end
of
a
year
of
conversational
courtship
,
*NL*
and
they
were
on
their
way
to
Gopher
Prairie
after
a
wedding
journey
in
*NL*
the
Colorado
mountains
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
hordes
of
the
way-train
were
not
altogether
new
to
Carol
.
She
had
*NL*
seen
them
on
trips
from
St.
Paul
to
Chicago
.
But
now
that
they
had
*NL*
become
her
own
people
,
to
bathe
and
encourage
and
adorn
,
she
had
an
*NL*
acute
and
uncomfortable
interest
in
them
.
They
distressed
her
.
They
*NL*
were
so
stolid
.
She
had
always
maintained
that
there
is
no
American
*NL*
peasantry
,
and
she
sought
now
to
defend
her
faith
by
seeing
imagination
*NL*
and
enterprise
in
the
young
Swedish
farmers
,
and
in
a
traveling
man
*NL*
working
over
his
order-blanks
.
But
the
older
people
,
Yankees
as
well
*NL*
as
Norwegians
,
Germans
,
Finns
,
Canucks
,
had
settled
into
submission
to
*NL*
poverty
.
They
were
peasants
,
she
groaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
n't
there
any
way
of
waking
them
up
?
What
would
happen
if
they
*NL*
understood
scientific
agriculture
?
''
she
begged
of
Kennicott
,
her
hand
*NL*
groping
for
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
a
transforming
honeymoon
.
She
had
been
frightened
to
*NL*
discover
how
tumultuous
a
feeling
could
be
roused
in
her
.
Will
had
been
*NL*
lordly
--
stalwart
,
jolly
,
impressively
competent
in
making
camp
,
tender
*NL*
and
understanding
through
the
hours
when
they
had
lain
side
by
side
in
a
*NL*
tent
pitched
among
pines
high
up
on
a
lonely
mountain
spur
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
swallowed
hers
as
he
started
from
thoughts
of
the
practise
to
*NL*
which
he
was
returning
.
``
These
people
?
Wake
'em
up
?
What
for
?
They
're
*NL*
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
so
provincial
.
No
,
that
is
n't
what
I
mean
.
They
're
--
oh
,
so
*NL*
sunk
in
the
mud
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
here
,
Carrie
.
You
want
to
get
over
your
city
idea
that
because
a
*NL*
man
's
pants
are
n't
pressed
,
he
's
a
fool
.
These
farmers
are
mighty
keen
*NL*
and
up-and-coming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
!
That
's
what
hurts
.
Life
seems
so
hard
for
them
--
these
lonely
*NL*
farms
and
this
gritty
train
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
do
n't
mind
it
.
Besides
,
things
are
changing
.
The
auto
,
the
*NL*
telephone
,
rural
free
delivery
;
they
're
bringing
the
farmers
in
closer
*NL*
touch
with
the
town
.
Takes
time
,
you
know
,
to
change
a
wilderness
like
*NL*
this
was
fifty
years
ago
.
But
already
,
why
,
they
can
hop
into
the
Ford
*NL*
or
the
Overland
and
get
in
to
the
movies
on
Saturday
evening
quicker
*NL*
than
you
could
get
down
to
'em
by
trolley
in
St.
Paul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
it
's
these
towns
we
've
been
passing
that
the
farmers
run
to
for
*NL*
relief
from
their
bleakness
--
Ca
n't
you
understand
?
Just
LOOK
at
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
was
amazed
.
Ever
since
childhood
he
had
seen
these
towns
from
*NL*
trains
on
this
same
line
.
He
grumbled
,
``
Why
,
what
's
the
matter
with
'em
?
*NL*
Good
hustling
burgs
.
It
would
astonish
you
to
know
how
much
wheat
and
*NL*
rye
and
corn
and
potatoes
they
ship
in
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
're
so
ugly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
admit
they
are
n't
comfy
like
Gopher
Prairie
.
But
give
'em
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
use
of
giving
them
time
unless
some
one
has
desire
and
*NL*
training
enough
to
plan
them
?
Hundreds
of
factories
trying
to
make
*NL*
attractive
motor
cars
,
but
these
towns
--
left
to
chance
.
No
!
That
ca
n't
*NL*
be
true
.
It
must
have
taken
genius
to
make
them
so
scrawny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
they
're
not
so
bad
,
''
was
all
he
answered
.
He
pretended
that
his
*NL*
hand
was
the
cat
and
hers
the
mouse
.
For
the
first
time
she
tolerated
*NL*
him
rather
than
encouraged
him
.
She
was
staring
out
at
Schoenstrom
,
a
*NL*
hamlet
of
perhaps
a
hundred
and
fifty
inhabitants
,
at
which
the
train
*NL*
was
stopping
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bearded
German
and
his
pucker-mouthed
wife
tugged
their
enormous
*NL*
imitation-leather
satchel
from
under
a
seat
and
waddled
out
.
The
station
*NL*
agent
hoisted
a
dead
calf
aboard
the
baggage-car
.
There
were
no
other
*NL*
visible
activities
in
Schoenstrom
.
In
the
quiet
of
the
halt
,
Carol
could
*NL*
hear
a
horse
kicking
his
stall
,
a
carpenter
shingling
a
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
business-center
of
Schoenstrom
took
up
one
side
of
one
block
,
facing
*NL*
the
railroad
.
It
was
a
row
of
one-story
shops
covered
with
galvanized
*NL*
iron
,
or
with
clapboards
painted
red
and
bilious
yellow
.
The
buildings
*NL*
were
as
ill-assorted
,
as
temporary-looking
,
as
a
mining-camp
street
in
*NL*
the
motion-pictures
.
The
railroad
station
was
a
one-room
frame
box
,
a
*NL*
mirey
cattle-pen
on
one
side
and
a
crimson
wheat-elevator
on
the
other
.
*NL*
The
elevator
,
with
its
cupola
on
the
ridge
of
a
shingled
roof
,
resembled
*NL*
a
broad-shouldered
man
with
a
small
,
vicious
,
pointed
head
.
The
only
*NL*
habitable
structures
to
be
seen
were
the
florid
red-brick
Catholic
*NL*
church
and
rectory
at
the
end
of
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
picked
at
Kennicott
's
sleeve
.
``
You
would
n't
call
this
a
not-so-bad
*NL*
town
,
would
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
Dutch
burgs
ARE
kind
of
slow
.
Still
,
at
that
--
See
that
fellow
*NL*
coming
out
of
the
general
store
there
,
getting
into
the
big
car
?
I
met
*NL*
him
once
.
He
owns
about
half
the
town
,
besides
the
store
.
Rauskukle
,
his
*NL*
name
is
.
He
owns
a
lot
of
mortgages
,
and
he
gambles
in
farm-lands
.
Good
*NL*
nut
on
him
,
that
fellow
.
Why
,
they
say
he
's
worth
three
or
four
hundred
*NL*
thousand
dollars
!
Got
a
dandy
great
big
yellow
brick
house
with
tiled
*NL*
walks
and
a
garden
and
everything
,
other
end
of
town
--
ca
n't
see
it
from
*NL*
here

I
've
gone
past
it
when
I
've
driven
through
here

Yes
sir
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
if
he
has
all
that
,
there
's
no
excuse
whatever
for
this
place
!
*NL*
If
his
three
hundred
thousand
went
back
into
the
town
,
where
it
belongs
,
*NL*
they
could
burn
up
these
shacks
,
and
build
a
dream-village
,
a
jewel
!
Why
*NL*
do
the
farmers
and
the
town-people
let
the
Baron
keep
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
I
do
n't
quite
get
you
sometimes

Carrie
.
Let
him
?
They
ca

help
themselves

He
's
a
dumm
old
Dutchman
,
and
probably
the
priest
can
*NL*
twist
him
around
his
finger
,
but
when
it
comes
to
picking
good
farming
*NL*
land

he
's
a
regular
wiz

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
He
's
their
symbol
of
beauty

*NL*
*NL*
``
Honestly

do
n't
know
what
you

driving

You
're
kind
of
played
out
,

after
this
long
trip

You
'll
feel
better
when
you
get
home
and
have
a
*NL*
good
bath
,
and
put
on
the
blue
negligee

That
's
some
vampire
costume

*NL*
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
squeezed
her
arm
,
looked
at
her
knowingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
moved
on
from
the
desert
stillness
of
the
Schoenstrom
station
.
The
*NL*
train
creaked
,
banged
,
swayed
.
The
air
was
nauseatingly
thick
.
Kennicott
*NL*
turned
her
face
from
the
window
,
rested
her
head
on
his
shoulder
.
She
*NL*
was
coaxed
from
her
unhappy
mood
.
But
she
came
out
of
it
unwillingly
,
*NL*
and
when
Kennicott
was
satisfied
that
he
had
corrected
all
her
worries
*NL*
and
had
opened
a
magazine
of
saffron
detective
stories
,
she
sat
upright
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
--
she
meditated
--
is
the
newest
empire
of
the
world
;
the
Northern
*NL*
Middlewest
;
a
land
of
dairy
herds
and
exquisite
lakes
,
of
new
*NL*
automobiles
and
tar-paper
shanties
and
silos
like
red
towers
,
of
clumsy
*NL*
speech
and
a
hope
that
is
boundless
.
An
empire
which
feeds
a
quarter
of
*NL*
the
world
--
yet
its
work
is
merely
begun
.
They
are
pioneers
,
these
sweaty
*NL*
wayfarers
,
for
all
their
telephones
and
bank-accounts
and
automatic
*NL*
pianos
and
co-operative
leagues
.
And
for
all
its
fat
richness
,
theirs
is
*NL*
a
pioneer
land
.
What
is
its
future
?
she
wondered
.
A
future
of
cities
*NL*
and
factory
smut
where
now
are
loping
empty
fields
?
Homes
universal
and
*NL*
secure
?
Or
placid
chateaux
ringed
with
sullen
huts
?
Youth
free
to
find
*NL*
knowledge
and
laughter
?
Willingness
to
sift
the
sanctified
lies
?
Or
*NL*
creamy-skinned
fat
women
,
smeared
with
grease
and
chalk
,
gorgeous
in
the
*NL*
skins
of
beasts
and
the
bloody
feathers
of
slain
birds
,
playing
bridge
*NL*
with
puffy
pink-nailed
jeweled
fingers
,
women
who
after
much
expenditure
*NL*
of
labor
and
bad
temper
still
grotesquely
resemble
their
own
flatulent
*NL*
lap-dogs
?
The
ancient
stale
inequalities
,
or
something
different
in
*NL*
history
,
unlike
the
tedious
maturity
of
other
empires
?
What
future
and
*NL*
what
hope
?
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
head
ached
with
the
riddle
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
the
prairie
,
flat
in
giant
patches
or
rolling
in
long
hummocks
.
*NL*
The
width
and
bigness
of
it
,
which
had
expanded
her
spirit
an
hour
ago
,
*NL*
began
to
frighten
her
.
It
spread
out
so
;
it
went
on
so
uncontrollably
;
*NL*
she
could
never
know
it
.
Kennicott
was
closeted
in
his
detective
story
.
*NL*
With
the
loneliness
which
comes
most
depressingly
in
the
midst
of
many
*NL*
people
she
tried
to
forget
problems
,
to
look
at
the
prairie
objectively
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grass
beside
the
railroad
had
been
burnt
over
;
it
was
a
smudge
*NL*
prickly
with
charred
stalks
of
weeds
.
Beyond
the
undeviating
barbed-wire
*NL*
fences
were
clumps
of
golden
rod
.
Only
this
thin
hedge
shut
them
off
*NL*
from
the
plains-shorn
wheat-lands
of
autumn
,
a
hundred
acres
to
a
field
,
*NL*
prickly
and
gray
near-by
but
in
the
blurred
distance
like
tawny
velvet
*NL*
stretched
over
dipping
hillocks
.
The
long
rows
of
wheat-shocks
marched
*NL*
like
soldiers
in
worn
yellow
tabards
.
The
newly
plowed
fields
were
*NL*
black
banners
fallen
on
the
distant
slope
.
It
was
a
martial
immensity
,
*NL*
vigorous
,
a
little
harsh
,
unsoftened
by
kindly
gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
expanse
was
relieved
by
clumps
of
oaks
with
patches
of
short
wild
*NL*
grass
;
and
every
mile
or
two
was
a
chain
of
cobalt
slews
,
with
the
*NL*
flicker
of
blackbirds
'
wings
across
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
working
land
was
turned
into
exuberance
by
the
light
.
The
*NL*
sunshine
was
dizzy
on
open
stubble
;
shadows
from
immense
cumulus
clouds
*NL*
were
forever
sliding
across
low
mounds
;
and
the
sky
was
wider
and
*NL*
loftier
and
more
resolutely
blue
than
the
sky
of
cities
...
she
*NL*
declared
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
glorious
country
;
a
land
to
be
big
in
,
''
she
crooned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Kennicott
startled
her
by
chuckling
,
``
D'
you
realize
the
town
after
*NL*
the
next
is
Gopher
Prairie
?
Home
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
That
one
word
--
home
--
it
terrified
her
.
Had
she
really
bound
herself
to
*NL*
live
,
inescapably
,
in
this
town
called
Gopher
Prairie
?
And
this
thick
*NL*
man
beside
her
,
who
dared
to
define
her
future
,
he
was
a
stranger
!
She
*NL*
turned
in
her
seat
,
stared
at
him
.
Who
was
he
?
Why
was
he
sitting
with
*NL*
her
?
He
was
n't
of
her
kind
!
His
neck
was
heavy
;
his
speech
was
heavy
;
he
*NL*
was
twelve
or
thirteen
years
older
than
she
;
and
about
him
was
none
of
*NL*
the
magic
of
shared
adventures
and
eagerness
.
She
could
not
believe
that
*NL*
she
had
ever
slept
in
his
arms
.
That
was
one
of
the
dreams
which
you
had
*NL*
but
did
not
officially
admit
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
herself
how
good
he
was
,
how
dependable
and
understanding
.
She
*NL*
touched
his
ear
,
smoothed
the
plane
of
his
solid
jaw
,
and
,
turning
away
*NL*
again
,
concentrated
upon
liking
his
town
.
It
would
n't
be
like
these
*NL*
barren
settlements
.
It
could
n't
be
!
Why
,
it
had
three
thousand
*NL*
population
.
That
was
a
great
many
people
.
There
would
be
six
hundred
*NL*
houses
or
more
.
And
--
The
lakes
near
it
would
be
so
lovely
.
She
'd
seen
*NL*
them
in
the
photographs
.
They
had
looked
charming
...
had
n't
they
?
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
train
left
Wahkeenyan
she
began
nervously
to
watch
for
the
*NL*
lakes
--
the
entrance
to
all
her
future
life
.
But
when
she
discovered
*NL*
them
,
to
the
left
of
the
track
,
her
only
impression
of
them
was
that
*NL*
they
resembled
the
photographs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
mile
from
Gopher
Prairie
the
track
mounts
a
curving
low
ridge
,
and
she
*NL*
could
see
the
town
as
a
whole
.
With
a
passionate
jerk
she
pushed
up
the
*NL*
window
,
looked
out
,
the
arched
fingers
of
her
left
hand
trembling
on
the
*NL*
sill
,
her
right
hand
at
her
breast
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
saw
that
Gopher
Prairie
was
merely
an
enlargement
of
all
the
*NL*
hamlets
which
they
had
been
passing
.
Only
to
the
eyes
of
a
Kennicott
was
*NL*
it
exceptional
.
The
huddled
low
wooden
houses
broke
the
plains
scarcely
*NL*
more
than
would
a
hazel
thicket
.
The
fields
swept
up
to
it
,
past
it
.
*NL*
It
was
unprotected
and
unprotecting
;
there
was
no
dignity
in
it
nor
*NL*
any
hope
of
greatness
.
Only
the
tall
red
grain-elevator
and
a
few
tinny
*NL*
church-steeples
rose
from
the
mass
.
It
was
a
frontier
camp
.
It
was
not
a
*NL*
place
to
live
in
,
not
possibly
,
not
conceivably
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
people
--
they
'd
be
as
drab
as
their
houses
,
as
flat
as
their
fields
.
*NL*
She
could
n't
stay
here
.
She
would
have
to
wrench
loose
from
this
man
,
*NL*
and
flee
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
peeped
at
him
.
She
was
at
once
helpless
before
his
mature
fixity
,
*NL*
and
touched
by
his
excitement
as
he
sent
his
magazine
skittering
along
*NL*
the
aisle
,
stooped
for
their
bags
,
came
up
with
flushed
face
,
and
*NL*
gloated
,
``
Here
we
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
loyally
,
and
looked
away
.
The
train
was
entering
town
.
The
*NL*
houses
on
the
outskirts
were
dusky
old
red
mansions
with
wooden
frills
,
*NL*
or
gaunt
frame
shelters
like
grocery
boxes
,
or
new
bungalows
with
*NL*
concrete
foundations
imitating
stone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
the
train
was
passing
the
elevator
,
the
grim
storage-tanks
for
oil
,
*NL*
a
creamery
,
a
lumber-yard
,
a
stock-yard
muddy
and
trampled
and
stinking
.
*NL*
Now
they
were
stopping
at
a
squat
red
frame
station
,
the
platform
*NL*
crowded
with
unshaven
farmers
and
with
loafers
--
unadventurous
people
*NL*
with
dead
eyes
.
She
was
here
.
She
could
not
go
on
.
It
was
the
end
--
the
*NL*
end
of
the
world
.
She
sat
with
closed
eyes
,
longing
to
push
past
*NL*
Kennicott
,
hide
somewhere
in
the
train
,
flee
on
toward
the
Pacific
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
large
arose
in
her
soul
and
commanded
,
``
Stop
it
!
Stop
being
a
*NL*
whining
baby
!
''
She
stood
up
quickly
;
she
said
,
``
Is
n't
it
wonderful
to
be
*NL*
here
at
last
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
trusted
her
so
.
She
would
make
herself
like
the
place
.
And
she
was
*NL*
going
to
do
tremendous
things
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
Kennicott
and
the
bobbing
ends
of
the
two
bags
which
*NL*
he
carried
.
They
were
held
back
by
the
slow
line
of
disembarking
*NL*
passengers
.
She
reminded
herself
that
she
was
actually
at
the
dramatic
*NL*
moment
of
the
bride
's
home-coming
.
She
ought
to
feel
exalted
.
She
felt
*NL*
nothing
at
all
except
irritation
at
their
slow
progress
toward
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
stooped
to
peer
through
the
windows
.
He
shyly
exulted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
!
Look
!
There
's
a
bunch
come
down
to
welcome
us
!
Sam
Clark
and
the
*NL*
missus
and
Dave
Dyer
and
Jack
Elder
,
and
,
yes
sir
,
Harry
Haydock
and
*NL*
Juanita
,
and
a
whole
crowd
!
I
guess
they
see
us
now
.
Yuh
,
yuh
sure
,
they
*NL*
see
us
!
See
'em
waving
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
obediently
bent
her
head
to
look
out
at
them
.
She
had
hold
of
*NL*
herself
.
She
was
ready
to
love
them
.
But
she
was
embarrassed
by
the
*NL*
heartiness
of
the
cheering
group
.
From
the
vestibule
she
waved
to
them
,
*NL*
but
she
clung
a
second
to
the
sleeve
of
the
brakeman
who
helped
her
down
*NL*
before
she
had
the
courage
to
dive
into
the
cataract
of
hand-shaking
*NL*
people
,
people
whom
she
could
not
tell
apart
.
She
had
the
impression
*NL*
that
all
the
men
had
coarse
voices
,
large
damp
hands
,
tooth-brush
*NL*
mustaches
,
bald
spots
,
and
Masonic
watch-charms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
they
were
welcoming
her
.
Their
hands
,
their
smiles
,
their
*NL*
shouts
,
their
affectionate
eyes
overcame
her
.
She
stammered
,
``
Thank
you
,
*NL*
oh
,
thank
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
men
was
clamoring
at
Kennicott
,
``
I
brought
my
machine
down
to
*NL*
take
you
home
,
doc
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
business
,
Sam
!
''
cried
Kennicott
;
and
,
to
Carol
,
``
Let
's
jump
in

*NL*
That
big
Paige

there

''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
when
she
was
in
the
motor
car
did
she
distinguish
the
three
people
*NL*
who
were
to
accompany
them
.
The
owner
,
now
at
the
wheel
,
was
the
essence
*NL*
of
decent
self-satisfaction
;
a
baldish
,
largish
,
level-eyed
man
,
rugged
*NL*
of
neck
but
sleek
and
round
of
face
--
face
like
the
back
of
a
spoon
bowl
.
*NL*
He
was
chuckling
at
her
,
``
Have
you
got
us
all
straight
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course
she
has
!
Trust
Carrie
to
get
things
straight

get
'em

*NL*
quick

I
bet
she
could
tell
you
every
date
in
history

''
boasted
her
*NL*
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
man
looked
at
her
reassuringly
and
with
a
certainty
that
he
*NL*
was
a
person
whom
she
could
trust
she
confessed
,
``
As
a
matter
of
fact
I
*NL*
have
n't
got
anybody
straight

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course

Well

Carol
smiled
lavishly
,
and
wished
that
she
*NL*
called
people
by
their
given
names
more
easily
.
``
The

Contentedly
Sam
Clark
drove
off

in
the
heavy
traffic
of
three
Fords
and
*NL*
the
Minniemashie
House
Free

*NL*
*NL*
``

She
glanced
at
the
houses
;
tried
not
to
see
what
she
saw
;
*NL*
gave
way
in
:
``
Why
do
these

so

Her
husband
bent
over
her
.

*NL*

She
whispered
to
him
-LRB-
while
Mrs.
Clark
considerately
turned
away
-RRB-
,
``
I
*NL*
love
you

``

*NL*
She
laid
the
back
of
his
hand
against
her
cheek
,
snuggled
near
him
.
She
*NL*
was
ready
for
her
new
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
told
her
that
,
with
his
widowed
mother
as
housekeeper
,
he
*NL*
had
occupied
an
old
house
,
``
but
nice
and
roomy
,
and
well-heated
,
best
*NL*
furnace
I
could
find
on
the
market

His
mother
had
left
Carol
her
love
,
*NL*
and
gone
back
to
Lac-qui-Meurt
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
would
be
wonderful
,
she
exulted
,
not
to
have
to
live
in
Other
*NL*
People
's
Houses
,
but
to
make
her
own
shrine
.
She
held
his
hand
tightly
*NL*
and
stared
ahead
as
the
car
swung
round
a
corner
and
stopped
in
the
*NL*
street
before
a
prosaic
frame
house
in
a
small
parched
lawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
concrete
sidewalk
with
a
``
parking
''
of
grass
and
mud
.
A
square
smug
*NL*
brown
house
,
rather
damp
.
A
narrow
concrete
walk
up
to
it
.
Sickly
yellow
*NL*
leaves
in
a
windrow
with
dried
wings
of
box-elder
seeds
and
snags
*NL*
of
wool
from
the
cotton-woods
.
A
screened
porch
with
pillars
of
thin
*NL*
painted
pine
surmounted
by
scrolls
and
brackets
and
bumps
of
jigsawed
*NL*
wood
.
No
shrubbery
to
shut
off
the
public
gaze
.
A
lugubrious
bay-window
*NL*
to
the
right
of
the
porch
.
Window
curtains
of
starched
cheap
lace
*NL*
revealing
a
pink
marble
table
with
a
conch
shell
and
a
Family
Bible

*NL*
*NL*
``
You

could

were

''
*NL*
Kennicott
sounded
doubtful
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
come
back
to
*NL*
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
real
home
!
''
She
was
moved
by
his
humility
.
She
gaily
motioned
*NL*
good-by
to
the
Clarks
.
He
unlocked
the
door
--
he
was
leaving
the
choice
*NL*
of
a
maid
to
her
,
and
there
was
no
one
in
the
house
.
She
jiggled
while
*NL*
he
turned
the
key
,
and
scampered
in
...
It
was
next
day
before
either
*NL*
of
them
remembered
that
in
their
honeymoon
camp
they
had
planned
that
he
*NL*
should
carry
her
over
the
sill
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
hallway
and
front
parlor
she
was
conscious
of
dinginess
and
*NL*
lugubriousness
and
airlessness
,
but
she
insisted
,
``
I
'll
make
it
all
*NL*
jolly
.
''
As
she
followed
Kennicott
and
the
bags
up
to
their
bedroom
she
*NL*
quavered
to
herself
the
song
of
the
fat
little-gods
of
the
hearth
:
*NL*
*NL*
I
have
my
own
home
,
*NL*
To
do
what
I
please
with
,
*NL*
To
do

*NL*
My
den
for
me
and
my
mate
and
my
cubs

*NL*
My
own
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
close
in
her
husband
's
arms
;
she
clung
to
him
;
whatever
of
*NL*
strangeness
and
slowness
and
insularity
she
might
find
in
him
,
none
of
*NL*
that
mattered
so
long
as
she
could
slip
her
hands
beneath
his
coat
,
run
*NL*
her
fingers
over
the
warm
smoothness
of
the
satin
back
of
his
waistcoat
,
*NL*
seem
almost
to
creep
into
his
body
,
find
in
him
strength
,
find
in
the
*NL*
courage
and
kindness
of
her
man
a
shelter
from
the
perplexing
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sweet

so
sweet

she
whispered

*NL*
``
THE
Clarks

folks
to

Kennicott
,
as
he
unpacked
his
suit-case

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

is
nice
of

*NL*
*NL*
``

Squarest
people

Uh
,
*NL*
Carrie
--
Would
you
mind
if
I
sneaked
down
to
the
office
for
an
hour
,
*NL*
just
to
see
how
things
are
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
no
.
Of
course
not
.
I
know
you
're
keen
to
get
back
to
work

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
you
do
n't
mind
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
a
bit
.
Out
of
my
way
.
Let
me
unpack
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
advocate
of
freedom
in
marriage
was
as
much
disappointed
as
*NL*
a
drooping
bride
at
the
alacrity
with
which
he
took
that
freedom
and
*NL*
escaped
to
the
world
of
men
's
affairs
.
She
gazed
about
their
bedroom
,
*NL*
and
its
full
dismalness
crawled
over
her
:
the
awkward
knuckly
L-shape
*NL*
of
it
;
the
black
walnut
bed
with
apples
and
spotty
pears
carved
on
the
*NL*
headboard
;
the
imitation
maple
bureau
,
with
pink-daubed
scent-bottles
*NL*
and
a
petticoated
pin-cushion
on
a
marble
slab
uncomfortably
like
a
*NL*
gravestone
;
the
plain
pine
washstand
and
the
garlanded
water-pitcher
and
*NL*
bowl
.
The
scent
was
of
horsehair
and
plush
and
Florida
Water
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
could
people
ever
live
with
things
like
this
?
''
she
shuddered
.
She
*NL*
saw
the
furniture
as
a
circle
of
elderly
judges
,
condemning
her
to
death
*NL*
by
smothering
.
The
tottering
brocade
chair
squeaked
,
``
Choke
her
--
choke
*NL*
her
--
smother
her
.
''
The
old
linen
smelled
of
the
tomb
.
She
was
alone
in
*NL*
this
house
,
this
strange
still
house
,
among
the
shadows
of
dead
thoughts
*NL*
and
haunting
repressions
.
``
I
hate
it
!
I
hate
it
!
''
she
panted
.
``
Why
did
I
*NL*
ever
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
that
Kennicott
's
mother
had
brought
these
family
*NL*
relics
from
the
old
home
in
Lac-qui-Meurt
.
``
Stop
it
!
They
're
perfectly
*NL*
comfortable
things
.
They
're
--
comfortable
.
Besides
--
Oh
,
they
're
*NL*
horrible
!
We
'll
change
them
,
right
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
``
But
of
course
he
HAS
to
see
how
things
are
at
the
office
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
a
pretense
of
busying
herself
with
unpacking
.
The
chintz-lined
,
*NL*
silver-fitted
bag
which
had
seemed
so
desirable
a
luxury
in
St.
Paul
was
*NL*
an
extravagant
vanity
here
.
The
daring
black
chemise
of
frail
chiffon
*NL*
and
lace
was
a
hussy
at
which
the
deep-bosomed
bed
stiffened
in
disgust
,
*NL*
and
she
hurled
it
into
a
bureau
drawer
,
hid
it
beneath
a
sensible
linen
*NL*
blouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
gave
up
unpacking
.
She
went
to
the
window
,
with
a
purely
literary
*NL*
thought
of
village
charm
--
hollyhocks
and
lanes
and
apple-cheeked
*NL*
cottagers
.
What
she
saw
was
the
side
of
the
Seventh-Day
Adventist
*NL*
Church
--
a
plain
clapboard
wall
of
a
sour
liver
color
;
the
ash-pile
*NL*
back
of
the
church
;
an
unpainted
stable
;
and
an
alley
in
which
a
Ford
*NL*
delivery-wagon
had
been
stranded
.
This
was
the
terraced
garden
below
her
*NL*
boudoir
;
this

nebulous
Lord

not

shut
up

*NL*

'll
see

She
fled
from
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
with
seriousness
at
every
concrete
crossing
,
every
*NL*
hitching-post
,
every
rake
for
leaves
;
and
to
each
house
she
devoted
all
*NL*
her
speculation
.
What
would
they
come
to
mean
?
How
would
they
look
six
*NL*
months
from
now
?
In
which
of
them
would
she
be
dining
?
Which
of
these
*NL*
people
whom
she
passed
,
now
mere
arrangements
of
hair
and
clothes
,
would
*NL*
turn
into
intimates
,
loved
or
dreaded
,
different
from
all
the
other
*NL*
people
in
the
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
came
into
the
small
business-section
she
inspected
a
broad-beamed
*NL*
grocer
in
an
alpaca
coat
who
was
bending
over
the
apples
and
celery
on
a
*NL*
slanted
platform
in
front
of
his
store
.
Would
she
ever
talk
to
him
?
What
*NL*
would
he
say
if
she
stopped
and
stated
,
``
I
am
Mrs.
Dr.
Kennicott
.
Some
*NL*
day
I
hope
to
confide
that
a
heap
of
extremely
dubious
pumpkins
as
a
*NL*
window-display
does
n't
exhilarate
me
much

The
grocer
was
Mr.
Frederick
F.
Ludelmeyer
,
whose
market
is
at
the
*NL*
corner
of
Main
Street
and
Lincoln
Avenue
.
In
supposing
that
only
she
was
*NL*
observant
Carol
was
ignorant
,
misled
by
the
indifference
of
cities
.
She
*NL*
fancied
that
she
was
slipping
through
the
streets
invisible
;
but
when
*NL*
she
had
passed
,
Mr.
Ludelmeyer
puffed
into
the
store
and
coughed
at
his
*NL*
clerk
,
``
I
seen
a
young
woman
,
she
come
along

street
.
I
bet
she
*NL*
iss
Doc
Kennicott

,
good-looker
,
nice
legs

but
she
wore
a
*NL*
hell
of
a
plain
suit
,
no
style
,
I
wonder
will
she
pay
cash
,
I
bet
she
*NL*
goes
to
Howland
&
Gould

more
as
she
does
here

When
Carol
had
walked
for
thirty-two
minutes
she
had
completely
covered
*NL*
the
town
,
east
and
west
,
north
and
south
;
and
she
stood
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
Main
Street
and
Washington
Avenue
and
despaired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Main
Street
with
its
two-story
brick
shops
,
its
story-and-a-half
wooden
*NL*
residences
,
its
muddy
expanse
from
concrete
walk
to
walk
,
its
huddle
*NL*
of
Fords
and
lumber-wagons
,
was
too
small
to
absorb
her
.
The
broad
,
*NL*
straight
,
unenticing
gashes
of
the
streets
let
in
the
grasping
prairie
*NL*
on
every
side
.
She
realized
the
vastness
and
the
emptiness
of
the
land
.
*NL*
The
skeleton
iron
windmill
on
the
farm
a
few
blocks
away
,
at
the
north
*NL*
end
of
Main
Street
,
was
like
the
ribs
of
a
dead
cow
.
She
thought
of
the
*NL*
coming
of
the
Northern
winter
,
when
the
unprotected
houses
would
crouch
*NL*
together
in
terror
of
storms
galloping
out
of
that
wild
waste
.
They
*NL*
were
so
small
and
weak
,
the
little
brown
houses
.
They
were
shelters
for
*NL*
sparrows
,
not
homes
for
warm
laughing
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
herself
that
down
the
street
the
leaves
were
a
splendor
.
The
*NL*
maples
were
orange
;
the
oaks
a
solid
tint
of
raspberry
.
And
the
lawns
*NL*
had
been
nursed
with
love
.
But
the
thought
would
not
hold
.
At
best
the
*NL*
trees
resembled
a
thinned
woodlot
.
There
was
no
park
to
rest
the
eyes
.
*NL*
And
since
not
Gopher
Prairie
but
Wakamin
was
the
county-seat
,
there
was
*NL*
no
court-house
with
its
grounds
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
through
the
fly-specked
windows
of
the
most
pretentious
*NL*
building
in
sight
,
the
one
place
which
welcomed
strangers
and
*NL*
determined
their
opinion
of
the
charm
and
luxury
of
Gopher
Prairie
--
the
*NL*
Minniemashie
House
.
It
was
a
tall
lean
shabby
structure
,
three
stories
*NL*
of
yellow-streaked
wood
,
the
corners
covered
with
sanded
pine
slabs
*NL*
purporting
to
symbolize
stone
.
In
the
hotel
office
she
could
see
a
*NL*
stretch
of
bare
unclean
floor
,
a
line
of
rickety
chairs
with
brass
*NL*
cuspidors
between
,
a
writing-desk
with
advertisements
in
mother-of-pearl
*NL*
letters
upon
the
glass-covered
back
.
The
dining-room
beyond
was
a
jungle
*NL*
of
stained
table-cloths
and
catsup
bottles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
no
more
at
the
Minniemashie
House
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
in
cuffless
shirt-sleeves
with
pink
arm-garters
,
wearing
a
linen
*NL*
collar
but
no
tie
,
yawned
his
way
from
Dyer
's
Drug
Store
across
to
the
*NL*
hotel
.
He
leaned
against
the
wall
,
scratched
a
while
,
sighed
,
and
in
a
*NL*
bored
way
gossiped
with
a
man
tilted
back
in
a
chair
.
A
lumber-wagon
,
*NL*
its
long
green
box
filled
with
large
spools
of
barbed-wire
fencing
,
*NL*
creaked
down
the
block
.
A
Ford
,
in
reverse
,
sounded
as
though
it
*NL*
were
shaking
to
pieces
,
then
recovered
and
rattled
away
.
In
the
Greek
*NL*
candy-store
was
the
whine
of
a
peanut-roaster
,
and
the
oily
smell
of
*NL*
nuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
other
sound
nor
sign
of
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
run
,
fleeing
from
the
encroaching
prairie
,
demanding
the
*NL*
security
of
a
great
city
.
Her
dreams
of
creating
a
beautiful
town
were
*NL*
ludicrous
.
Oozing
out
from
every
drab
wall
,
she
felt
a
forbidding
spirit
*NL*
which
she
could
never
conquer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
trailed
down
the
street
on
one
side
,
back
on
the
other
,
glancing
*NL*
into
the
cross
streets
.
It
was
a
private
Seeing
Main
Street
tour
.
She
*NL*
was
within
ten
minutes
beholding
not
only
the
heart
of
a
place
called
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
,
but
ten
thousand
towns
from
Albany
to
San
Diego
:
*NL*
*NL*
Dyer
's
Drug
Store
,
a
corner
building
of
regular
and
unreal
blocks
of
*NL*
artificial
stone
.
Inside
the
store
,
a
greasy
marble
soda-fountain
with
*NL*
an
electric
lamp
of
red
and
green
and
curdled-yellow
mosaic
*NL*
shade
.
Pawed-over
heaps
of
tooth-brushes
and
combs
and
packages
of
*NL*
shaving-soap
.
Shelves
of
soap-cartons
,
teething-rings
,
garden-seeds

and
patent
medicines
in

``

for

,
for

``

--
notorious
mixtures
of
opium

,
in

the
very
shop
to
which
her

sent
patients
for
the
filling

From

down

From
them
a
stink
of
stale

beer
,

thick
voices
bellowing
pidgin
German
or
trolling
out
dirty

songs
--
vice
gone
feeble
and
unenterprising

dull

the
delicacy

minus

or
large
,
*NL*
comfortable
,
soundly
uninteresting
symbols
of
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
town
not
one
building
save
the
Ionic
bank
which
gave
pleasure
*NL*
to
Carol
's
eyes
;
not
a
dozen
buildings
which
suggested
that
,
in
the
*NL*
fifty
years
of
Gopher
Prairie
's
existence
,
the
citizens
had
realized
*NL*
that
it
was
either
desirable
or
possible
to
make
this
,
their
common
*NL*
home
,
amusing
or
attractive
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
only
the
unsparing
unapologetic
ugliness
and
the
rigid
*NL*
straightness
which
overwhelmed
her
.
It
was
the
planlessness
,
the
flimsy
*NL*
temporariness
of
the
buildings
,
their
faded
unpleasant
colors
.
The
*NL*
street
was
cluttered
with
electric-light
poles
,
telephone
poles
,
*NL*
gasoline
pumps
for
motor
cars
,
boxes
of
goods
.
Each
man
had
built
*NL*
with
the
most
valiant
disregard
of
all
the
others
.
Between
a
large
*NL*
new
``
block
''
of
two-story
brick
shops
on
one
side
,
and
the
fire-brick
*NL*
Overland
garage
on
the
other
side
,
was
a
one-story
cottage
turned
into
*NL*
a
millinery
shop
.
The
white
temple
of
the
Farmers
'
Bank
was
elbowed
back
*NL*
by
a
grocery
of
glaring
yellow
brick
.
One
store-building
had
a
patchy
*NL*
galvanized
iron
cornice
;
the
building
beside
it
was
crowned
with
*NL*
battlements
and
pyramids
of
brick
capped
with
blocks
of
red
sandstone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
escaped
from
Main
Street
,
fled
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
n't
have
cared
,
she
insisted
,
if
the
people
had
been
comely
.
*NL*
She
had
noted
a
young
man
loafing
before
a
shop
,
one
unwashed
hand
*NL*
holding
the
cord
of
an
awning
;
a
middle-aged
man
who
had
a
way
of
*NL*
staring
at
women
as
though
he
had
been
married
too
long
and
too
*NL*
prosaically
;
an
old
farmer
,
solid
,
wholesome
,
but
not
clean
--
his
face
*NL*
like
a
potato
fresh
from
the
earth
.
None
of
them
had
shaved
for
three
*NL*
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
they
ca
n't
build
shrines
,
out
here
on
the
prairie
,
surely
there
's
*NL*
nothing
to
prevent
their
buying
safety-razors
!
''
she
raged
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fought
herself
:
``
I
must
be
wrong
.
People
do
live
here
.
It
CA
N'T
be
*NL*
as
ugly
as
--
as
I
know
it
is
!
I
must
be
wrong
.
But
I
ca
n't
do
it
.
I
ca
n't
*NL*
go
through
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
home
too
seriously
worried
for
hysteria
;
and
when
she
found
*NL*
Kennicott
waiting
for
her
,
and
exulting
,
``
Have
a
walk
?
Well
,
like
*NL*
the
town
?
Great
lawns
and
trees
,
eh
?
''
she
was
able
to
say
,
with
a
*NL*
self-protective
maturity
new
to
her
,
``
It
's
very
interesting
.

*NL*
The
train
which
brought
Carol
to
Gopher
Prairie
also
brought
Miss
Bea
*NL*
Sorenson
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bea
was
a
stalwart
,
corn-colored
,
laughing
young
woman
,
and
she
was
*NL*
bored
by
farm-work
.
She
desired
the
excitements
of
city-life
,
and
the
*NL*
way
to
enjoy
city-life
was
,
she
had
decided
,
to
``
go
get
a
yob
as
hired
*NL*
girl
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
''
She
contentedly
lugged
her
pasteboard
telescope
*NL*
from
the
station
to
her
cousin
,
Tina
Malmquist
,
maid
of
all
work
in
the
*NL*
residence
of
Mrs.
Luke
Dawson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vell
,
so
you
come
to
town
,
''
said
Tina
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ya

Ay

''
said
Bea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

You

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

Dr.

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ya
,
''
said
Bea
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
chanced
that
Carol
Kennicott
and
Bea
Sorenson
were
viewing
Main
*NL*
Street
at
the
same
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
had
never
before
been
in
a
town
larger
than
Scandia
Crossing
,
which
*NL*
has
sixty-seven
inhabitants
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
marched
up
the
street
she
was
meditating
that
it
did
n't
hardly
*NL*
seem
like
it
was
possible
there
could
be
so
many
folks
all
in
one
place
*NL*
at
the
same
time
.
My
!
It
would
take
years
to
get
acquainted
with
them
*NL*
all
.
And
swell
people
,
too
!
A
fine
big
gentleman
in
a
new
pink
shirt
*NL*
with
a
diamond
,
and
not
no
washed-out
blue
denim
working-shirt
.
A
lovely
*NL*
lady
in
a
longery
dress
-LRB-
but
it
must
be
an
awful
hard
dress
to
wash
-RRB-
.
*NL*
And
the
stores
!
*NL*
*NL*
Not
just
three
of
them
,
like
there
were
at
Scandia
Crossing
,
but
more
*NL*
than
four
whole
blocks
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
Bon
Ton
Store
--
big
as
four
barns
--
my
!
it
would
simply
scare
a
person
*NL*
to
go
in
there
,
with
seven
or
eight
clerks
all
looking
at
you
.
And
the
*NL*
men
's
suits
,
on
figures
just
like
human
.
And
Axel
Egge
's
,
like
home
,
*NL*
lots
of
Swedes
and
Norskes
in
there
,
and
a
card
of
dandy
buttons
,
like
*NL*
rubies
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
drug
store
with
a
soda
fountain
that
was
just
huge
,
awful
long
,
and
*NL*
all
lovely
marble
;
and
on
it
there
was
a
great
big
lamp
with
the
biggest
*NL*
shade
you
ever
saw
--
all
different
kinds
colored
glass
stuck
together
;
*NL*
and
the
soda
spouts
,
they
were
silver
,
and
they
came
right
out
of
the
*NL*
bottom
of
the
lamp-stand
!
Behind
the
fountain
there
were
glass
shelves
,
*NL*
and
bottles
of
new
kinds
of
soft
drinks
,
that
nobody
ever
heard
of
.
*NL*
Suppose
a
fella
took
you
THERE
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
hotel
,
awful
high
,
higher
than
Oscar
Tollefson
's
new
red
barn
;
three
*NL*
stories
,
one
right
on
top
of
another
;
you
had
to
stick
your
head
back
*NL*
to
look
clear
up
to
the
top
.
There
was
a
swell
traveling
man
in
*NL*
there
--
probably
been
to
Chicago
,
lots
of
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Oh
,
the
dandiest
people
to
know
here
!
There
was
a
lady
going
by
,
you
*NL*
would
n't
hardly
say
she
was
any
older
than
Bea
herself
;
she
wore
a
dandy
*NL*
new
gray
suit
and
black
pumps
.
She
almost
looked
like
she
was
looking
*NL*
over
the
town
,
too
.
But
you
could
n't
tell
what
she
thought
.
Bea
would
*NL*
like
to
be
that
way
--
kind
of
quiet
,
so
nobody
would
get
fresh
.
Kind
*NL*
of
--
oh
,
elegant
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Lutheran
Church
.
Here
in
the
city
there
'd
be
lovely
sermons
,
and
*NL*
church
twice
on
Sunday
,
EVERY
Sunday
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
a
movie
show
!
*NL*
*NL*
A
regular
theater
,
just
for
movies
.
With
the
sign
``
Change
of
bill
every
*NL*
evening
.
''
Pictures
every
evening
!
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
movies
in
Scandia
Crossing
,
but
only
once
every
two
weeks
,
*NL*
and
it
took
the
Sorensons
an
hour
to
drive
in
--
papa
was
such
a
tightwad
*NL*
he
would
n't
get
a
Ford
.
But
here
she
could
put
on
her
hat
any
evening
,
*NL*
and
in
three
minutes
'
walk
be
to
the
movies
,
and
see
lovely
fellows
in
*NL*
dress-suits
and
Bill
Hart
and
everything
!
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
they
have
so
many
stores
?
Why
!
There
was
one
just
for
tobacco
*NL*
alone
,
and
one
-LRB-
a
lovely
one
--
the
Art
Shoppy
it
was
-RRB-
for
pictures
and
*NL*
vases
and
stuff
,
with
oh
,
the
dandiest
vase
made
so
it
looked
just
like
*NL*
a
tree
trunk
!
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
stood
on
the
corner
of
Main
Street
and
Washington
Avenue
.
The
roar
*NL*
of
the
city
began
to
frighten
her
.
There
were
five
automobiles
on
the
*NL*
street
all
at
the
same
time
--
and
one
of
'em
was
a
great
big
car
that
*NL*
must
of
cost
two
thousand
dollars
--
and
the
`
bus
was
starting
for
a
train
*NL*
with
five
elegant-dressed
fellows
,
and
a
man
was
pasting
up
red
bills
*NL*
with
lovely
pictures
of
washing-machines
on
them
,
and
the
jeweler
was
*NL*
laying
out
bracelets
and
wrist-watches
and
EVERYTHING
on
real
velvet
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
did
she
care
if
she
got
six
dollars
a
week
?
Or
two
!
It
was
worth
*NL*
while
working
for
nothing
,
to
be
allowed
to
stay
here
.
And
think
how
it
*NL*
would
be
in
the
evening
,
all
lighted
up
--
and
not
with
no
lamps
,
but
with
*NL*
electrics
!
And
maybe
a
gentleman
friend
taking
you
to
the
movies
and
*NL*
buying
you
a
strawberry
ice
cream
soda
!
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
trudged
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vell
?
You
lak
it
?
''
said
Tina
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
The
recently
built
house
of
Sam
Clark
,
in
which
was
given
the
party
to
*NL*
welcome
Carol
,
was
one
of
the
largest
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
It
had
a
clean
*NL*
sweep
of
clapboards
,
a
solid
squareness
,
a
small
tower
,
and
a
large
*NL*
screened
porch
.
Inside
,
it
was
as
shiny
,
as
hard
,
and
as
cheerful
as
a
*NL*
new
oak
upright
piano
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
looked
imploringly
at
Sam
Clark
as
he
rolled
to
the
door
and
*NL*
shouted
,
``
Welcome
,
little
lady
!
The
keys
of
the
city
are
yourn
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Beyond
him
,
in
the
hallway
and
the
living-room
,
sitting
in
a
vast
prim
*NL*
circle
as
though
they
were
attending
a
funeral
,
she
saw
the
guests
.
They
*NL*
were
WAITING
so
!
They
were
waiting
for
her
!
The
determination
to
be
all
*NL*
one
pretty
flowerlet
of
appreciation
leaked
away
.
She
begged
of
Sam
,
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
dare
face
them
!
They
expect
so
much
.
They
'll
swallow
me
in
one
*NL*
mouthful
--
glump
!
--
like
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
sister
,
they
're
going
to
love
you
--
same
as
I
would
if
I
did
n't
*NL*
think
the
doc
here
would
beat
me
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
B-but
--
I
do
n't
dare
!
Faces
to
the
right
of
me
,
faces
in
front
of
me
,
*NL*
volley
and
wonder
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sounded
hysterical
to
herself
;
she
fancied
that
to
Sam
Clark
she
*NL*
sounded
insane
.
But
he
chuckled
,
``
Now
you
just
cuddle
under
Sam
's
wing
,
*NL*
and
if
anybody
rubbers
at
you
too
long
,
I
'll
shoo
'em
off
.
Here
we
go
!
*NL*
Watch
my
smoke
--
Sam
`
l
,
the
ladies
'
delight
and
the
bridegrooms
'
terror
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
arm
about
her
,
he
led
her
in
and
bawled
,
``
Ladies
and
worser
halves
,
*NL*
the
bride
!
We
wo
n't
introduce
her
round
yet
,
because
she
'll
never
get
*NL*
your
bum
names
straight
anyway
.
Now
bust
up
this
star-chamber
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
tittered
politely
,
but
they
did
not
move
from
the
social
security
*NL*
of
their
circle
,
and
they
did
not
cease
staring
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
given
creative
energy
to
dressing
for
the
event
.
Her
hair
was
*NL*
demure
,
low
on
her
forehead
with
a
parting
and
a
coiled
braid
.
Now
she
*NL*
wished
that
she
had
piled
it
high
.
Her
frock
was
an
ingenue
slip
*NL*
of
lawn
,
with
a
wide
gold
sash
and
a
low
square
neck
,
which
gave
a
*NL*
suggestion
of
throat
and
molded
shoulders
.
But
as
they
looked
her
over
*NL*
she
was
certain
that
it
was
all
wrong
.
She
wished
alternately
that
she
*NL*
had
worn
a
spinsterish
high-necked
dress
,
and
that
she
had
dared
to
*NL*
shock
them
with
a
violent
brick-red
scarf
which
she
had
bought
in
*NL*
Chicago
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
led
about
the
circle
.
Her
voice
mechanically
produced
safe
*NL*
remarks
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
'm
sure
I
'm
going
to
like
it
here
ever
so
much
,
''
and
``
Yes
,
we
did
*NL*
have
the
best
time
in
Colorado
--
mountains
,
''
and
``
Yes
,
I
lived
in
St.
*NL*
Paul
several
years
.
Euclid
P.
Tinker

No
,
I
do
n't
REMEMBER
meeting
him
,
*NL*
but
I
'm
pretty
sure
I
've
heard
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
took
her
aside
and
whispered
,
``
Now
I
'll
introduce
you
to
them
,
*NL*
one
at
a
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me
about
them
first

``
Well

Carol
gazed
with
a
polite
approximation
to
interest
at
Mr.

*NL*
a

person
with
a
wide
mouth

He
led
her
to
the
Dawsons

*NL*
*NL*
Luke
Dawson
,
lender
of
money
on
mortgages
,
owner
of
Northern
cut-over
*NL*
land
,
was
a
hesitant
man
in
unpressed
soft
gray
clothes
,
with
bulging
*NL*
eyes
in
a
milky
face
.
His
wife
had
bleached
cheeks
,
bleached
hair
,
*NL*
bleached
voice
,
and
a
bleached
manner
.
She
wore
her
expensive
green
*NL*
frock
,
with
its
passementeried
bosom
,
bead
tassels
,
and
gaps
between
the
*NL*
buttons
down
the
back
,
as
though
she
had
bought
it
second-hand
and
was
*NL*
afraid
of
meeting
the
former
owner
.
They
were
shy
.
It
was
``
Professor
''
*NL*
George
Edwin
Mott
,
superintendent
of
schools
,
a
Chinese
mandarin
turned
*NL*
brown
,
who
held
Carol
's
hand
and
made
her
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Dawsons
and
Mr.
Mott
had
stated
that
they
were
``
pleased
to
meet
*NL*
her
,
''
there
seemed
to
be
nothing
else
to
say
,
but
the
conversation
went
*NL*
on
automatically
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
like
Gopher
Prairie

whimpered
Mrs.

*NL*

Oh

Mrs.

looked
to
Mr.

for
social
*NL*
and
intellectual
aid
.
He
lectured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
's
a
fine
class

their

especially
the
Germans

They
hate

They
hate

But
the
rest

are
a
fine
class

Did
you
know

*NL*
*NL*
The
Dawsons
and
Mr.
Mott
teetered
upon
weary
feet
,
and
smiled
at
Carol
*NL*
with
crystallized
expressions
.
She
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tell
me

Mr.
Mott
:
Have
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

Those

Most
of

would-be

simply

notoriety-seekers

I
believe
in

training

Latin
and

mathematics
always
will
be
the
backbone

sound
Americanism

no

*NL*
*NL*
The
Dawsons
smiled
their
appreciation
of
listening
to
a
savant
.
Carol
*NL*
waited
till
Kennicott
should
rescue
her
.
The
rest
of
the
party
waited
*NL*
for
the
miracle
of
being
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
and
Juanita
Haydock
,
Rita
Simons
and
Dr.
Terry
Gould
--
the
young
*NL*
smart
set
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
was
led
to
them
.
Juanita
Haydock
flung
*NL*
at
her
in
a
high
,
cackling
,
friendly
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
this
is
SO
nice
to
have
you
here

We
'll
have
some
good
*NL*
parties

dances
and
everything
.
You
'll
have
to
join
the
Jolly
Seventeen

*NL*
We
play
bridge
and
we
have
a
supper
once
a
month
.
You
play
,
of
course

*NL*
*NL*
``
N-no

I
do

*NL*
*NL*
``
Really

In

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
to
teach
you

Bridge
is
half
the
fun
of
life

''
Juanita
had
*NL*
become
patronizing
,
and
she
glanced
disrespectfully
at
Carol
's
golden
*NL*
sash
,
which
she
had
previously
admired
.
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
Haydock
said
politely
,
``
How
do
you
think
you
're
going
to
like
the
*NL*
old
burg

*NL*

Did
you
know
that
Percy
Bresnahan
came
from
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
perceived
that
she
had
been
weakened
in
the
biological
struggle
*NL*
by
disclosing
her
lack
of
bridge
.
Roused
to
nervous
desire
to
regain
*NL*
her
position
she
turned
on
Dr.
Terry
Gould
,
the
young
and
pool-playing
*NL*
competitor
of
her
husband
.
Her
eyes
coquetted
with
him
while
she
gushed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
learn
bridge
.
But
what
I
really
love
most
is
the
outdoors
.
Ca
n't
*NL*
we
all
get
up
a
boating
party
,
and
fish
,
or
whatever
you
do
,
and
have
a
*NL*
picnic
supper
afterwards
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
're
talking
!
''
Dr.
Gould
affirmed
.
He
looked
rather
too
obviously
*NL*
at
the
cream-smooth
slope
of
her
shoulder
.
``
Like
fishing
?
Fishing
is
my
*NL*
middle
name

I
'll
teach
you
bridge

Like
cards
at
all
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
used
to
be
rather
good
at
bezique
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
bezique
was
a
game
of
cards
--
or
a
game
of
something
else
.
*NL*
Roulette
,
possibly
.
But
her
lie
was
a
triumph
.
Juanita
's
handsome
,
*NL*
high-colored
,
horsey
face
showed
doubt
.
Harry
stroked
his
nose
and
said
*NL*
humbly
,
``
Bezique
?
Used
to
be
great
gambling
game
,
was
n't
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
others
drifted
to
her
group
,
Carol
snatched
up
the
conversation
.
*NL*
She
laughed
and
was
frivolous
and
rather
brittle
.
She
could
not
*NL*
distinguish
their
eyes
.
They
were
a
blurry
theater-audience
before
which
*NL*
she
self-consciously
enacted
the
comedy
of
being
the
Clever
Little
Bride
*NL*
of
Doc
Kennicott
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
These-here
celebrated
Open
Spaces

's
what
I

going
out

I
'll
*NL*
never
read
anything
but
the
sporting-page
again
.
Will
converted
me
on
*NL*
our
Colorado
trip
.
There
were
so
many
mousey
tourists
who
were
afraid
*NL*
to
get
out
of
the
motor
`
bus
that
I
decided
to
be
Annie
Oakley
,
the
Wild
*NL*
Western
Wampire
,
and
I
bought
oh
!
a
vociferous
skirt
which
revealed
*NL*
my
perfectly
nice
ankles
to
the
Presbyterian
glare
of
all
the
Ioway
*NL*
schoolma'ams
,
and
I
leaped
from
peak
to
peak
like
the
nimble
chamoys
,
*NL*
and
--
You
may
think
that
Herr
Doctor
Kennicott
is
a
Nimrod
,
but
you
*NL*
ought
to
have
seen
me
daring
him
to
strip
to
his
B.
V.
D.
's
and
go
*NL*
swimming
in
an
icy
mountain
brook

*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
they
were
thinking
of
becoming
shocked
,
but
Juanita
*NL*
Haydock
was
admiring
,
at
least
.
She
swaggered
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
I
'm
going
to
ruin

respectable
practitioner

,
Dr.
Gould
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
's
rival
gasped
at
this
insult
to
professional
ethics
,
and
he
*NL*
took
an
appreciable
second
before
he
recovered
his
social
manner
.
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
,
Mrs.
Kennicott
.
''
He
smiled
at
Kennicott
,
to
imply
that
*NL*
whatever
he
might
say
in
the
stress
of
being
witty
was
not
to
count
*NL*
against
him
in
the
commercio-medical
warfare
.
``

whisper

for

sake
do
n't
tell

I
said
so

do
n't
you
ever
go
to
him

anything
*NL*
more
serious
than
a
pendectomy
of
the
left
ear
or
a
strabismus
of
the
*NL*
cardiograph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
save
Kennicott
knew
exactly
what
this
meant
,
but
they
laughed
,
*NL*
and
Sam
Clark
's
party
assumed
a
glittering
lemon-yellow
color
of
brocade
*NL*
panels
and
champagne
and
tulle
and
crystal
chandeliers
and
sporting
*NL*
duchesses
.
Carol
saw
that
George
Edwin
Mott
and
the
blanched
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Dawson
were
not
yet
hypnotized
.
They
looked
as
though
they
wondered
*NL*
whether
they
ought
to
look
as
though
they
disapproved
.
She
concentrated
*NL*
on
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
whom
I
would
n't
have
dared
to
go
to
Colorado
with

Mr.

there

I
'm
sure
he
's
a
regular
heart-breaker

When
we
were
*NL*
introduced
he
held
my
hand
and
squeezed
it
frightfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Haw
!
Haw

Haw
!

The
entire
company
applauded
.
Mr.
Dawson
was
beatified
.
*NL*
He
had
been
called
many
things
--
loan-shark
,
skinflint
,
tightwad
,
*NL*
pussyfoot
--
but
he
had
never
before
been
called
a
flirt

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
is
wicked

Do

have
to
lock

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no

but
maybe
I
better

''
attempted
Mrs.
Dawson
,
a
tint
on
her
pallid
*NL*
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
fifteen
minutes
Carol
kept
it
up
.
She
asserted
that
she
was
going
*NL*
to
stage
a
musical
comedy
,
that
she
preferred
cafe
parfait
to
beefsteak
,
*NL*
that
she
hoped
Dr.
Kennicott
would
never
lose
his
ability
to
make
love
*NL*
to
charming
women
,
and
that
she
had
a
pair
of
gold
stockings
.
They
gaped
*NL*
for
more
.
But
she
could
not
keep
it
up
.
She
retired
to
a
chair
behind
*NL*
Sam
Clark
's
bulk
.
The
smile-wrinkles
solemnly
flattened
out
in
the
faces
*NL*
of
all
the
other
collaborators
in
having
a
party
,
and
again
they
stood
*NL*
about
hoping
but
not
expecting
to
be
amused
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
listened
.
She
discovered
that
conversation
did
not
exist
in
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
.
Even
at
this
affair
,
which
brought
out
the
young
smart
set
,
*NL*
the
hunting
squire
set
,
the
respectable
intellectual
set
,
and
the
solid
*NL*
financial
set
,
they
sat
up
with
gaiety
as
with
a
corpse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
talked
a
good
deal
in
her
rattling
voice
but
it
was
*NL*
invariably
of
personalities
:
the
rumor
that
Raymie
Wutherspoon
was
going
*NL*
to
send
for
a
pair
of
patent
leather
shoes
with
gray
buttoned
tops
;
the
*NL*
rheumatism
of
Champ
Perry
;
the
state
of
Guy
Pollock
's
grippe
;
and
the
*NL*
dementia
of
Jim
Howland
in
painting
his
fence
salmon-pink
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
Clark
had
been
talking
to
Carol
about
motor
cars
,
but
he
felt
*NL*
his
duties
as
host
.
While
he
droned
,
his
brows
popped
up
and
down
.
He
*NL*
interrupted
himself
,
``
Must
stir
'em
up

He
worried
at
his
wife
,
``

stir
'em
up

''
He
shouldered
into
the
center
of
the
*NL*
room
,
and
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
have
some
stunts
,
folks
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

shrieked
Juanita
Haydock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say

give
us
that
stunt
about
the
Norwegian
catching
a
hen

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet

that
's
a
slick
stunt

do
that

Dave

''
cheered
Chet
Dashaway
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Dave
Dyer
obliged
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
guests
moved
their
lips
in
anticipation
of
being
called
on
for
*NL*
their
own
stunts
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ella
,
come
on
and
recite
`
Old
Sweetheart
of
Mine
,
'
for
us
,
''
demanded
*NL*
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Ella
Stowbody
,
the
spinster
daughter
of
the
Ionic
bank
,
scratched
*NL*
her
dry
palms
and
blushed
.
``
Oh
,
you
do
n't
want
to
hear
that
old
thing
*NL*
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
we
do
!
You
bet

asserted
Sam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
voice
is
in
terrible
shape
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
!
Come
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
loudly
explained
to
Carol
,
``
Ella
is
our
shark
at
elocuting
.
She
's
*NL*
had
professional
training
.
She
studied
singing
and
oratory
and
dramatic
*NL*
art
and
shorthand
for
a
year
,
in
Milwaukee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Stowbody
was
reciting
.
As
encore
to
``
An
Old
Sweetheart
of
Mine
,
''
*NL*
she
gave
a
peculiarly
optimistic
poem
regarding
the
value
of
smiles
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
four
other
stunts
:
one
Jewish
,
one
Irish
,
one
juvenile
,
and
*NL*
Nat
Hicks
's
parody
of
Mark
Antony
's
funeral
oration
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
winter
Carol
was
to
hear
Dave
Dyer
's
hen-catching
*NL*
impersonation
seven
times
,
``
An
Old
Sweetheart
of
Mine
''
nine
times
,
the
*NL*
Jewish
story
and
the
funeral
oration
twice
;
but
now
she
was
ardent
*NL*
and
,
because
she
did
so
want
to
be
happy
and
simple-hearted
,
she
was
as
*NL*
disappointed
as
the
others
when
the
stunts
were
finished
,
and
the
party
*NL*
instantly
sank
back
into
coma
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
gave
up
trying
to
be
festive
;
they
began
to
talk
naturally
,
as
they
*NL*
did
at
their
shops
and
homes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
men
and
women
divided
,
as
they
had
been
tending
to
do
all
evening
.
*NL*
Carol
was
deserted
by
the
men
,
left
to
a
group
of
matrons
who
steadily
*NL*
pattered
of
children
,
sickness
,
and
cooks
--
their
own
shop-talk
.
She
was
*NL*
piqued
.
She
remembered
visions
of
herself
as
a
smart
married
woman
in
*NL*
a
drawing-room
,
fencing
with
clever
men
.
Her
dejection
was
relieved
by
*NL*
speculation
as
to
what
the
men
were
discussing
,
in
the
corner
between
*NL*
the
piano
and
the
phonograph
.
Did
they
rise
from
these
housewifely
*NL*
personalities
to
a
larger
world
of
abstractions
and
affairs
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
made
her
best
curtsy
to
Mrs.
Dawson
;
she
twittered
,
``
I
wo
n't
have
my
*NL*
husband
leaving
me
so
soon
!
I
'm
going
over
and
pull
the
wretch
's
*NL*
ears
.
''
She
rose
with
a
jeune
fille
bow
.
She
was
self-absorbed
and
*NL*
self-approving
because
she
had
attained
that
quality
of
sentimentality
.
*NL*
She
proudly
dipped
across
the
room
and
,
to
the
interest
and
commendation
*NL*
of
all
beholders
,
sat
on
the
arm
of
Kennicott
's
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gossiping
with
Sam
Clark
,
Luke
Dawson
,
Jackson
Elder
of
the
*NL*
planing-mill
,
Chet
Dashaway
,
Dave
Dyer
,
Harry
Haydock
,
and
Ezra
*NL*
Stowbody
,
president
of
the
Ionic
bank
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ezra
Stowbody
was
a
troglodyte
.
He
had
come
to
Gopher
Prairie
in
1865
.
*NL*
He
was
a
distinguished
bird
of
prey
--
swooping
thin
nose
,
turtle
mouth
,
*NL*
thick
brows
,
port-wine
cheeks
,
floss
of
white
hair
,
contemptuous
eyes
.
*NL*
He
was
not
happy
in
the
social
changes
of
thirty
years
.
Three
decades
*NL*
ago
,
Dr.
Westlake
,
Julius
Flickerbaugh
the
lawyer
,
Merriman
Peedy
the
*NL*
Congregational
pastor
and
himself
had
been
the
arbiters
.
That
was
as
*NL*
it
should
be
;
the
fine
arts
--
medicine
,
law
,
religion
,
and
*NL*
finance
--
recognized
as
aristocratic
;
four
Yankees
democratically
*NL*
chatting
with
but
ruling
the
Ohioans
and
Illini
and
Swedes
and
Germans
*NL*
who
had
ventured
to
follow
them
.
But
Westlake
was
old
,
almost
retired
;
*NL*
Julius
Flickerbaugh
had
lost
much
of
his
practice
to
livelier
attorneys
;
*NL*
Reverend
-LRB-
not
The
Reverend
-RRB-
Peedy
was
dead
;
and
nobody
was
impressed
in
*NL*
this
rotten
age
of
automobiles
by
the
``
spanking
grays
''
which
Ezra
still
*NL*
drove
.
The
town
was
as
heterogeneous
as
Chicago
.
Norwegians
and
Germans
*NL*
owned
stores
.
The
social
leaders
were
common
merchants
.
Selling
nails
*NL*
was
considered
as
sacred
as
banking
.
These
upstarts
--
the
Clarks
,
the
*NL*
Haydocks
--
had
no
dignity
.
They
were
sound
and
conservative
in
politics
,
*NL*
but
they
talked
about
motor
cars
and
pump-guns
and
heaven
only
knew
*NL*
what
new-fangled
fads
.
Mr.
Stowbody
felt
out
of
place
with
them
.
But
*NL*
his
brick
house
with
the
mansard
roof
was
still
the
largest
residence
in
*NL*
town
,
and
he
held
his
position
as
squire
by
occasionally
appearing
among
*NL*
the
younger
men
and
reminding
them
by
a
wintry
eye
that
without
the
*NL*
banker
none
of
them
could
carry
on
their
vulgar
businesses
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
Carol
defied
decency
by
sitting
down
with
the
men
,
Mr.
Stowbody
was
*NL*
piping
to
Mr.
Dawson
,
``
Say
,
Luke
,
when
was
'
t
Biggins
first
settled
in
*NL*
Winnebago
Township

it
in

?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
no

twa

''
Mr.
Dawson
was
indignant
.
``
He

out
from
Vermont
*NL*
in
1867

no

wait
,
in
1868
,
it
must
have
been

and
took
a
claim
on
the
*NL*
Rum
River
,
quite
a
ways
above
Anoka
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did

roared
Mr.
Stowbody
.
``
He
settled

Earth

*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
What
's
the
point

-RRB-
Carol
whispered
to
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
``
Whether
this
old
duck
Biggins

an
English
setter

*NL*
Dave
Dyer
interrupted
to
give
tidings
,
``

``

Chet
Dashaway

*NL*
*NL*
While
Mr.
Stowbody
gave
a
somatic
and
psychic
study
of
them
,
Carol
*NL*
reflected
,
``

terribly
interested

even
in

wonder

I
could
get

away
from

Let

risk
damnation
and
try

*NL*
*NL*
``
There
has

been
much

trouble
around

has
there

Mr.

she
asked
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

ma'am
,
thank
God

we
've
been
free
from
that

except
maybe
with

hired

farm-hands

Trouble
enough
with
these
foreign
farmers
;
*NL*
if
you
do
n't
watch
these
Swedes
they
turn
socialist
or
populist
or
some
*NL*
fool

in
a

Of

,
if
they
have

you
can

make

I
just
have
'em
come
into

talk

tell

Even
Jack

along

you

*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
``

Mr.

was
growing
more

more
belligerent

patriotic

ventured

*NL*
Mr.

thundered
his
answer

while
the

nodded

solemnly

*NL*
in
tune

like
a
shop-window

flexible

comic
mandarins

set
quivering

``
All

Mr.

wiped
his
brow

Dave

added
,
``
Sure

What
they

The
conversation
was
at
last
relieved
of
the
plague
of
Carol

intrusions

they
settled
down
to
the
question

whether
the
justice

sent
that
hobo
drunk
to

for
ten

twelve

It
was
a

Dave

communicated
his

carefree
adventures
on
the
gipsy

attain

Once

only

the

over

But
*NL*
me
,
''
he
glanced
about
importantly
,
as
one
convinced
that
no
other
hero
*NL*
had
ever
been
in
so
strange
a
plight
,
``
I
'm
so
darn
busy
I
do
n't
have
*NL*
much
time
to
read
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
read
anything
I
ca
n't
check
against
,
''
said
Sam
Clark
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
ended
the
literary
portion
of
the
conversation
,
and
for
seven
*NL*
minutes
Jackson
Elder
outlined
reasons
for
believing
that
the
*NL*
pike-fishing
was
better
on
the
west
shore
of
Lake
Minniemashie
than
on
*NL*
the
east
--
though
it
was
indeed
quite
true
that
on
the
east
shore
Nat
*NL*
Hicks
had
caught
a
pike
altogether
admirable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
talk
went
on
.
It
did
go
on
!
Their
voices
were
monotonous
,
*NL*
thick
,
emphatic
.
They
were
harshly
pompous
,
like
men
in
the
*NL*
smoking-compartments
of
Pullman
cars
.
They
did
not
bore
Carol
.
They
*NL*
frightened
her
.
She
panted
,
``
They
will
be
cordial
to
me
,
because
my
man
*NL*
belongs
to
their
tribe
.
God
help
me
if
I
were
an
outsider
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
as
changelessly
as
an
ivory
figurine
she
sat
quiescent
,
avoiding
*NL*
thought
,
glancing
about
the
living-room
and
hall
,
noting
their
betrayal
*NL*
of
unimaginative
commercial
prosperity
.
Kennicott
said
,
``
Dandy
interior
,
*NL*
eh
?
My
idea
of
how
a
place
ought
to
be
furnished
.
Modern
.
''
She
looked
*NL*
polite
,
and
observed
the
oiled
floors
,
hard-wood
staircase
,
unused
*NL*
fireplace
with
tiles
which
resembled
brown
linoleum
,
cut-glass
vases
*NL*
standing
upon
doilies
,
and
the
barred
,
shut
,
forbidding
unit
bookcases
*NL*
that
were
half
filled
with
swashbuckler
novels
and
unread-looking
sets
*NL*
of
Dickens
,
Kipling
,
O.
Henry
,
and
Elbert
Hubbard
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
perceived
that
even
personalities
were
failing
to
hold
the
party
.
*NL*
The
room
filled
with
hesitancy
as
with
a
fog
.
People
cleared
their
*NL*
throats
,
tried
to
choke
down
yawns
.
The
men
shot
their
cuffs
and
the
*NL*
women
stuck
their
combs
more
firmly
into
their
back
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
a
rattle
,
a
daring
hope
in
every
eye
,
the
swinging
of
a
door
,
the
*NL*
smell
of
strong
coffee
,
Dave
Dyer
's
mewing
voice
in
a
triumphant
,
``
The
*NL*
eats
!
''
They
began
to
chatter
.
They
had
something
to
do
.
They
could
*NL*
escape
from
themselves
.
They
fell
upon
the
food
--
chicken
sandwiches
,
*NL*
maple
cake
,
drug-store
ice
cream
.
Even
when
the
food
was
gone
they
*NL*
remained
cheerful
.
They
could
go
home
,
any
time
now
,
and
go
to
bed
!
*NL*
*NL*
They
went
,
with
a
flutter
of
coats
,
chiffon
scarfs
,
and
good-bys
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
and
Kennicott
walked
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
like
them
?
''
he
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
were
terribly
sweet
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uh
,
Carrie
--
You
ought
to
be
more
careful
about
shocking
folks

*NL*
Talking
about
gold
stockings

about
showing
your
ankles
to
*NL*
schoolteachers
and
all
!
''
More
mildly
:
``
You
gave
'em
a
good
time
,
but
I
'd
*NL*
watch
out
for
that
,

f
I

you

Juanita
Haydock
is
such
a
damn
cat

I
*NL*
would

give
her
a

criticize
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
poor
effort

lift
up

Was
I
wrong
to
try
to
amuse
them

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

No

Honey

I
did

up-and-coming

I
just
mean

onto
legs

all
that
immoral
*NL*
stuff

Pretty
conservative
crowd

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
silent
,
raw
with
the
shameful
thought
that
the
attentive
circle
*NL*
might
have
been
criticizing
her
,
laughing
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
,
please
do
n't

he
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Silence

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
;
I
'm
sorry
I
spoke
about
it

I
just
meant

were
crazy

Sam
said
to
me
,

little
lady

yours
is
the
slickest
*NL*
thing
that
ever
came
to
this

said
;
and
Ma
Dawson
--
I
did
n't
*NL*
hardly
know
whether
she
'd
like
you
or
not

she
's
such
a
dried-up
old
*NL*
bird
,
but
she
said
,

so
quick
and
bright
,
I
declare
,
she
*NL*
just
wakes
me
up

'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
liked
praise
,
the
flavor
and
fatness
of
it
,
but
she
was
so
*NL*
energetically
being
sorry
for
herself
that
she
could
not
taste
this
*NL*
commendation
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Please
!
Come
on
!
Cheer
up
!
''
His
lips
said
it
,
his
anxious
shoulder
said
*NL*
it
,
his
arm
about
her
said
it
,
as
they
halted
on
the
obscure
porch
of
*NL*
their
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
care
if
they
think
I
'm
flighty
,
Will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me

Why
,
I
would
n't
care
if
the
whole
world
thought

anything
else

You

well

you

my

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
an
undefined
mass
,
as
solid-seeming
as
rock
.
She
found
his
*NL*
sleeve
,
pinched
it
,
cried
,
``
I
'm
glad

It
's
sweet
to
be
wanted

You
must
*NL*
tolerate
my
frivolousness

*NL*
*NL*
He
lifted
her
,
carried
her
into
the
house
,
and
with
her
arms
about
his
*NL*
neck
she
forgot
Main
Street

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
WE
'LL
steal
the
whole
day
,
and
go
hunting
.
I
want
you
to
see
the
*NL*
country
round
here
,
''
Kennicott
announced
at
breakfast
.
``
I
'd
take
the
*NL*
car
--
want
you
to
see
how
swell
she
runs
since
I
put
in
a
new
piston
.
*NL*
But
we
'll
take
a
team
,
so
we
can
get
right
out
into
the
fields
.
Not
many
*NL*
prairie
chickens
left
now
,
but
we
might
just
happen
to
run
onto
a
small
*NL*
covey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
fussed
over
his
hunting-kit
.
He
pulled
his
hip
boots
out
to
full
*NL*
length
and
examined
them
for
holes
.
He
feverishly
counted
his
shotgun
*NL*
shells
,
lecturing
her
on
the
qualities
of
smokeless
powder
.
He
drew
the
*NL*
new
hammerless
shotgun
out
of
its
heavy
tan
leather
case
and
made
her
*NL*
peep
through
the
barrels
to
see
how
dazzlingly
free
they
were
from
rust
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
world
of
hunting
and
camping-outfits
and
fishing-tackle
was
*NL*
unfamiliar
to
her
,
and
in
Kennicott
's
interest
she
found
something
*NL*
creative
and
joyous
.
She
examined
the
smooth
stock
,
the
carved
hard
*NL*
rubber
butt
of
the
gun
.
The
shells
,
with
their
brass
caps
and
sleek
*NL*
green
bodies
and
hieroglyphics
on
the
wads
,
were
cool
and
comfortably
*NL*
heavy
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
wore
a
brown
canvas
hunting-coat
with
vast
pockets
lining
*NL*
the
inside
,
corduroy
trousers
which
bulged
at
the
wrinkles
,
peeled
and
*NL*
scarred
shoes
,
a
scarecrow
felt
hat
.
In
this
uniform
he
felt
virile
.
*NL*
They
clumped
out
to
the
livery
buggy
,
they
packed
the
kit
and
the
box
of
*NL*
lunch
into
the
back
,
crying
to
each
other
that
it
was
a
magnificent
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
borrowed
Jackson
Elder
's
red
and
white
English
setter
,
a
*NL*
complacent
dog
with
a
waving
tail
of
silver
hair
which
flickered
in
the
*NL*
sunshine
.
As
they
started
,
the
dog
yelped
,
and
leaped
at
the
horses
'
*NL*
heads
,
till
Kennicott
took
him
into
the
buggy
,
where
he
nuzzled
Carol
's
*NL*
knees
and
leaned
out
to
sneer
at
farm
mongrels
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grays
clattered
out
on
the
hard
dirt
road
with
a
pleasant
song
of
*NL*
hoofs
:
``
Ta
ta
ta
rat
!
Ta
ta
ta
rat
!
''
It
was
early
and
fresh
,
the
air
*NL*
whistling
,
frost
bright
on
the
golden
rod
.
As
the
sun
warmed
the
world
*NL*
of
stubble
into
a
welter
of
yellow
they
turned
from
the
highroad
,
*NL*
through
the
bars
of
a
farmer
's
gate
,
into
a
field
,
slowly
bumping
over
*NL*
the
uneven
earth
.
In
a
hollow
of
the
rolling
prairie
they
lost
sight
*NL*
even
of
the
country
road
.
It
was
warm
and
placid
.
Locusts
trilled
among
*NL*
the
dry
wheat-stalks
,
and
brilliant
little
flies
hurtled
across
the
*NL*
buggy
.
A
buzz
of
content
filled
the
air
.
Crows
loitered
and
gossiped
in
*NL*
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
had
been
let
out
and
after
a
dance
of
excitement
he
settled
down
*NL*
to
a
steady
quartering
of
the
field
,
forth
and
back
,
forth
and
back
,
his
*NL*
nose
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pete
Rustad
owns
this
farm
,
and
he
told
me
he
saw
a
small
covey
of
*NL*
chickens
in
the
west
forty
,
last
week
.
Maybe
we
'll
get
some
sport
after
*NL*
all
,
''
Kennicott
chuckled
blissfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
the
dog
in
suspense
,
breathing
quickly
every
time
he
seemed
*NL*
to
halt
.
She
had
no
desire
to
slaughter
birds
,
but
she
did
desire
to
*NL*
belong
to
Kennicott
's
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
dog
stopped
,
on
the
point
,
a
forepaw
held
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
golly
!
He
's
hit
a
scent
!
Come
on
!
''
squealed
Kennicott
.
He
leaped
*NL*
from
the
buggy
,
twisted
the
reins
about
the
whip-socket
,
swung
her
out
,
*NL*
caught
up
his
gun
,
slipped
in
two
shells
,
stalked
toward
the
rigid
dog
,
*NL*
Carol
pattering
after
him
.
The
setter
crawled
ahead
,
his
tail
quivering
,
*NL*
his
belly
close
to
the
stubble
.
Carol
was
nervous
.
She
expected
clouds
*NL*
of
large
birds
to
fly
up
instantly
.
Her
eyes
were
strained
with
staring
.
*NL*
But
they
followed
the
dog
for
a
quarter
of
a
mile
,
turning
,
doubling
,
*NL*
crossing
two
low
hills
,
kicking
through
a
swale
of
weeds
,
crawling
*NL*
between
the
strands
of
a
barbed-wire
fence
.
The
walking
was
hard
on
*NL*
her
pavement-trained
feet
.
The
earth
was
lumpy
,
the
stubble
prickly
and
*NL*
lined
with
grass
,
thistles
,
abortive
stumps
of
clover
.
She
dragged
and
*NL*
floundered
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
heard
Kennicott
gasp
,
``
Look
!
''
Three
gray
birds
were
starting
up
*NL*
from
the
stubble
.
They
were
round
,
dumpy
,
like
enormous
bumble
bees
.
*NL*
Kennicott
was
sighting
,
moving
the
barrel
.
She
was
agitated
.
Why
did
n't
*NL*
he
fire
?
The
birds
would
be
gone
!
Then
a
crash
,
another
,
and
two
birds
*NL*
turned
somersaults
in
the
air
,
plumped
down
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
showed
her
the
birds
she
had
no
sensation
of
blood
.
These
heaps
*NL*
of
feathers
were
so
soft
and
unbruised
--
there
was
about
them
no
hint
of
*NL*
death
.
She
watched
her
conquering
man
tuck
them
into
his
inside
pocket
,
*NL*
and
trudged
with
him
back
to
the
buggy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
found
no
more
prairie
chickens
that
morning
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
noon
they
drove
into
her
first
farmyard
,
a
private
village
,
a
white
*NL*
house
with
no
porches
save
a
low
and
quite
dirty
stoop
at
the
back
,
*NL*
a
crimson
barn
with
white
trimmings
,
a
glazed
brick
silo
,
an
*NL*
ex-carriage-shed
,
now
the
garage
of
a
Ford
,
an
unpainted
cow-stable
,
a
*NL*
chicken-house
,
a
pig-pen
,
a
corn-crib
,
a
granary
,
the
galvanized-iron
*NL*
skeleton
tower
of
a
wind-mill
.
The
dooryard
was
of
packed
yellow
clay
,
*NL*
treeless
,
barren
of
grass
,
littered
with
rusty
plowshares
and
wheels
*NL*
of
discarded
cultivators
.
Hardened
trampled
mud
,
like
lava
,
filled
the
*NL*
pig-pen
.
The
doors
of
the
house
were
grime-rubbed
,
the
corners
and
eaves
*NL*
were
rusted
with
rain
,
and
the
child
who
stared
at
them
from
the
kitchen
*NL*
window
was
smeary-faced
.
But
beyond
the
barn
was
a
clump
of
scarlet
*NL*
geraniums
;
the
prairie
breeze
was
sunshine
in
motion
;
the
flashing
metal
*NL*
blades
of
the
windmill
revolved
with
a
lively
hum
;
a
horse
neighed
,
a
*NL*
rooster
crowed
,
martins
flew
in
and
out
of
the
cow-stable
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
spare
woman
with
flaxen
hair
trotted
from
the
house
.
She
was
*NL*
twanging
a
Swedish
patois
--
not
in
monotone
,
like
English
,
but
singing
*NL*
it
,
with
a
lyrical
whine
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pete
he
say
you
kom
pretty
soon
hunting
,

.

''
Mrs.
Rustad
was
shining
with
*NL*
welcome
.
``
Vell
,

*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
wonder
if
you
would
n't
like
to
give

a
glass

*NL*
condescended
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vell
Ay
should
say
Ay

har
a
second
and

''
She
nervously
hastened
to
a
tiny
red
building
beside
the
*NL*
windmill
;
she
came
back
with
a
pitcher
of
milk
from
which
Carol
filled
*NL*
the
thermos
bottle
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
drove
off
Carol
admired
,
``
She
's
the
dearest
thing
I
ever
saw
.
*NL*
And
she
adores
you
.
You

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

''
Carol
was
plunged
back
into
last
night
's
Weltschmerz
.
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
these
farmers
are
n't
bigger
than
we
are
?
So
simple
and
*NL*
hard-working
.
The
town
lives
on
them
.
We
townies
are
parasites
,
and
yet
*NL*
we
feel
superior
to
them
.
Last
night
I
heard
Mr.
Haydock
talking
about
*NL*
`
hicks
.
'
Apparently
he
despises
the
farmers
because
they
have
n't
reached
*NL*
the
social
heights
of
selling
thread
and
buttons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Parasites
?
Us
?
Where
'd
the
farmers
be
without
the
town
?
Who
lends
them
*NL*
money
?
Who
--
why
,
we
supply
them
with
everything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
find
that
some
of
the
farmers
think
they
pay
too
much
for
the
*NL*
services
of
the
towns
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
of
course
there
's
a
lot
of
cranks
among
the
farmers

as
there
*NL*
are
among
any
class
.
Listen
to
some
of
these
kickers
,
a
fellow
'd
*NL*
think
that
the
farmers
ought
to
run
the
state
and
the
whole
*NL*
shooting-match
--
probably
if
they
had
their
way
they
'd
fill
up
the
*NL*
legislature
with
a
lot
of
farmers
in
manure-covered
boots
--
yes
,
and
*NL*
they
'd
come
tell
me
I
was
hired
on
a
salary
now
,
and
could
n't
fix
my
*NL*
fees
!
That
'd
be
fine
for
you

would
n't
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
should
n't
they
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

That
bunch
of

Telling
ME

Oh
,
for
heaven
's
sake
,
let
's
quit
*NL*
arguing
.
All
this
discussing
may
be
all
right
at
a
party
but
--
Let
's
*NL*
forget
it
while
we
're
hunting

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

The
Wonderlust

probably
it
's
a
worse
affliction
than
the
*NL*
Wanderlust

I
just
wonder

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
herself
that
she
had
everything
in
the

And
after
each
*NL*
self-rebuke
she
stumbled
again
on

*NL*
They
ate
their
sandwiches
by
a
prairie
slew
:
long
grass
reaching
up
out
*NL*
of
clear
water
,
mossy
bogs
,
red-winged
black-birds
,
the
scum
a
splash
of
*NL*
gold-green
.
Kennicott
smoked
a
pipe
while
she
leaned
back
in
the
buggy
*NL*
and
let
her
tired
spirit
be
absorbed
in
the
Nirvana
of
the
incomparable
*NL*
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
lurched
to
the
highroad
and
awoke
from
their
sun-soaked
drowse
at
*NL*
the
sound
of
the
clopping
hoofs
.
They
paused
to
look
for
partridges
in
a
*NL*
rim
of
woods
,
little
woods
,
very
clean
and
shiny
and
gay
,
silver
birches
*NL*
and
poplars
with
immaculate
green
trunks
,
encircling
a
lake
of
sandy
*NL*
bottom
,
a
splashing
seclusion
demure
in
the
welter
of
hot
prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
brought
down
a
fat
red
squirrel
and
at
dusk
he
had
a
dramatic
*NL*
shot
at
a
flight
of
ducks
whirling
down
from
the
upper
air
,
skimming
the
*NL*
lake
,
instantly
vanishing
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
home
under
the
sunset
.
Mounds
of
straw
,
and
wheat-stacks
like
*NL*
bee-hives
,
stood
out
in
startling
rose
and
gold
,
and
the
green-tufted
*NL*
stubble
glistened
.
As
the
vast
girdle
of
crimson
darkened
,
the
fulfilled
*NL*
land
became
autumnal
in
deep
reds
and
browns
.
The
black
road
before
*NL*
the
buggy
turned
to
a
faint
lavender
,
then
was
blotted
to
uncertain
*NL*
grayness
.
Cattle
came
in
a
long
line
up
to
the
barred
gates
of
the
*NL*
farmyards
,
and
over
the
resting
land
was
a
dark
glow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
found
the
dignity
and
greatness
which
had
failed
her
in
Main
*NL*
Street
.

Till
they
had
a
maid
they
took
noon
dinner
and
six
o'clock
supper
at
*NL*
Mrs.
Gurrey
's
boarding-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Elisha
Gurrey
,
relict
of
Deacon
Gurrey
the
dealer
in
hay
and
grain
,
*NL*
was
a
pointed-nosed
,
simpering
woman
with
iron-gray
hair
drawn
so
tight
*NL*
that
it
resembled
a
soiled
handkerchief
covering
her
head
.
But
she
was
*NL*
unexpectedly
cheerful
,
and
her
dining-room
,
with
its
thin
tablecloth
on
*NL*
a
long
pine
table
,
had
the
decency
of
clean
bareness
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
line
of
unsmiling
,
methodically
chewing
guests
,
like
horses
at
*NL*
a
manger
,
Carol
came
to
distinguish
one
countenance
:
the
pale
,
long
,
*NL*
spectacled
face
and
sandy
pompadour
hair
of
Mr.
Raymond
P.
Wutherspoon
,
*NL*
known
as
``
Raymie
,
''
professional
bachelor
,
manager
and
one
half
the
*NL*
sales-force
in
the
shoe-department
of
the
Bon
Ton
Store
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
will
enjoy
Gopher
Prairie
very
much

Mrs.
Kennicott

''
petitioned
*NL*
Raymie
.
His
eyes
were
like
those
of
a
dog
waiting
to
be
let
in
out
of
*NL*
the
cold
.
He
passed
the
stewed
apricots
effusively
.

school

is
such
a
pleasing

bright

I
was
fitting
her
to
a
pair
*NL*
of
tan
gaiters
yesterday

I
declare
,
it
really
was
a
pleasure

*NL*
*NL*
``
Gim
me
the
butter

Carrie
,
''
was
Kennicott
's
comment
.
She
defied
him
by
*NL*
encouraging
Raymie
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
have
amateur
dramatics
and
so
on
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
The
town
's
just
full
of
talent

The
Knights
of
Pythias
put
on
a
*NL*
dandy
minstrel
show
last
year

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
nice

enthusiastic

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you

Lots

folks
jolly
me

trying

get
*NL*
up
shows

so
on
.
I
tell
them
they
have
more
artistic
gifts
than
they
*NL*
know

Just
yesterday
I
was
saying
to
Harry
Haydock
:
if
he
would
read
*NL*
poetry
,
like
Longfellow
,
or
if
he
would
join
the
band
--
I
get
so
much
*NL*
pleasure
out
of
playing
the
cornet
,
and
our
band-leader
,
Del
Snafflin
,
*NL*
is
such
a
good
musician
,
I
often
say
he
ought
to
give
up
his
barbering
*NL*
and
become
a
professional
musician
,
he
could
play
the
clarinet
in
*NL*
Minneapolis

New
York
or
anywhere
,
but
--
but
I
could
n't
get
Harry
to
*NL*
see
it
at
all

--
I
hear
you
and
the
doctor
went
out
hunting
yesterday
.
*NL*
Lovely
country
,
is
n't
it
.
And
did
you
make
some
calls
?
The
mercantile
*NL*
life
is
n't
inspiring
like
medicine

It
must
be
wonderful
to
see
how
*NL*
patients
trust
you

doctor

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh

It
's
me
that
's
got
to
do
all
the
trusting

Be
damn

more

wonderful

f
they
'd
pay
their

grumbled
Kennicott
and
,
to
Carol
,
*NL*
he
whispered
something
which
sounded
like
``
gentleman
hen
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Raymie
's
pale
eyes
were
watering
at
her
.
She
helped
him
with
,
``
So
*NL*
you
like
to
read
poetry

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
so
much

though
to
tell
the
truth

I
do
n't
get
much
time
*NL*
for
reading
,
we
're
always
so
busy
at
the
store
and
--
But
we
had
the
*NL*
dandiest
professional
reciter
at
the
Pythian
Sisters
sociable
last
*NL*
winter
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
thought
she
heard
a
grunt
from
the
traveling
salesman
at
the
end
*NL*
of
the
table
,
and
Kennicott
's
jerking
elbow
was
a
grunt
embodied
.
She
*NL*
persisted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
get
to
see
many
plays
,
Mr.
Wutherspoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shone
at
her
like
a
dim
blue
March
moon
,
and
sighed
,
``
No
,
but
I
do
*NL*
love
the
movies
.
I
'm
a
real
fan
.
One
trouble
with
books
is
that
they
're
*NL*
not
so
thoroughly
safeguarded
by
intelligent
censors
as
the
movies
are
,
*NL*
and
when
you
drop
into
the
library
and
take
out
a
book
you
never
know
*NL*
what
you
're
wasting
your
time
on
.
What
I
like
in
books
is
a
wholesome
,
*NL*
really
improving
story
,
and
sometimes
--
Why
,
once
I
started
a
novel
by
*NL*
this
fellow
Balzac
that
you
read
about
,
and
it
told
how
a
lady
was
n't
*NL*
living
with
her
husband
,
I
mean
she
was
n't
his
wife
.
It
went
into
*NL*
details
,
disgustingly
!
And
the
English
was
real
poor
.
I
spoke
to
the
*NL*
library
about
it
,
and
they
took
it
off
the
shelves
.
I
'm
not
narrow
,
*NL*
but
I
must
say
I
do
n't
see
any
use
in
this
deliberately
dragging
in
*NL*
immorality
!
Life
itself
is
so
full
of
temptations
that
in
literature
one
*NL*
wants
only
that
which
is
pure
and
uplifting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
name
of
that
Balzac
yarn
?
Where
can
I
get
hold
of
it
?
''
*NL*
giggled
the
traveling
salesman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raymie
ignored
him
.
``
But
the
movies
,
they
are
mostly
clean
,
and
their
*NL*
humor
--
Do
n't
you
think
that
the
most
essential
quality
for
a
person
to
*NL*
have
is
a
sense
of
humor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
I
really
have
n't
much

said
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
finger
at
her
.
``
Now
,
now
,
you
're
too
modest

I
'm
sure
we
*NL*
can
all
see
that
you
have
a
perfectly
corking
sense
of
humor

Besides
,
*NL*
Dr.
Kennicott
would
n't
marry
a
lady
that
did

how

Kennicott

Aware
that

had
murmured

*NL*
she
desperately
hazarded
,
``
Architecture

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's

I

I
said

you

I
said
to

he

so
he

put

*NL*
*NL*
``

observed
the

*NL*
*NL*
Raymie
bared
his
teeth
like

``
Well

waylaid

From
the
Gopher
Prairie
Weekly
Dauntless
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
the
most
charming
affairs
of
the
season
was
held
Tuesday
evening
*NL*
at
the
handsome
new
residence
of
Sam
and
Mrs.
Clark
when
many
of
our
*NL*
most
prominent
citizens
gathered
to
greet
the
lovely
new
bride
of
our
*NL*
popular
local
physician
,
Dr.
Will
Kennicott
.
All
present
spoke
of
the
*NL*
many
charms
of
the
bride
,
formerly
Miss
Carol
Milford
of
St.

.
Games
*NL*
and
stunts
were
the
order
of
the
day
,
with
merry
talk
and
conversation
.
*NL*
At
a
late
hour
dainty
refreshments
were
served
,
and
the
party
broke
up
*NL*
with
many
expressions
of
pleasure
at
the
pleasant
affair
.
Among
those
*NL*
present
were
Mesdames
Kennicott

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.

Kennicott
,
for
the
past
several
years
one
of
our
most
popular
*NL*
and
skilful
physicians
and
surgeons

gave
the
town
a
delightful
surprise
*NL*
when
he
returned
from
an
extended
honeymoon
tour
in
Colorado
this
week
*NL*
with
his
charming
bride

socially
prominent
in
Minneapolis
and
Mankato
.
Mrs.
Kennicott
*NL*
is
a
lady
of
manifold
charms
,
not
only
of
striking
charm
of
appearance
*NL*
but
is
also
a
distinguished
graduate
of
a
school
in
the
East
and
has
*NL*
for
the
past
year
been
prominently
connected
in
an
important
position
*NL*
of
responsibility
with
the
St.
Paul
Public
Library
,
in
which
city
Dr.
*NL*
``
Will
''
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
her
.
The
city
of
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
welcomes
her
to
our
midst
and
prophesies
for
her
many
happy
years
in
*NL*
the
energetic
city
of
the
twin
lakes
and
the
future
.
The
Dr.
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
will
reside
for
the
present
at
the
Doctor
's
home
on
Poplar
*NL*
Street
which
his
charming
mother
has
been
keeping
for
him
who
has
now
*NL*
returned
to
her
own
home
at
Lac-qui-Meurt
leaving
a
host
of
friends
who
*NL*
regret
her
absence
and
hope
to
see
her
soon
with
us
again
.

She
knew
that
if
she
was
ever
to
effect
any
of
the
``
reforms
''
which
she
*NL*
had
pictured
,
she
must
have
a
starting-place
.
What
confused
her
during
*NL*
the
three
or
four
months
after
her
marriage
was
not
lack
of
perception
*NL*
that
she
must
be
definite
,
but
sheer
careless
happiness
of
her
first
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
pride
of
being
a
housewife
she
loved
every
detail
--
the
brocade
*NL*
armchair
with
the
weak
back
,
even
the
brass
water-cock
on
the
hot-water
*NL*
reservoir
,
when
she
had
become
familiar
with
it
by
trying
to
scour
it
to
*NL*
brilliance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
a
maid
--
plump
radiant
Bea
Sorenson
from
Scandia
Crossing
.
Bea
*NL*
was
droll
in
her
attempt
to
be
at
once
a
respectful
servant
and
a
bosom
*NL*
friend
.
They
laughed
together
over
the
fact
that
the
stove
did
not
draw
,
*NL*
over
the
slipperiness
of
fish
in
the
pan
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
a
child
playing
Grandma
in
a
trailing
skirt
,
Carol
paraded
uptown
*NL*
for
her
marketing
,
crying
greetings
to
housewives
along
the
way
.
*NL*
Everybody
bowed
to
her
,
strangers
and
all
,
and
made
her
feel
that
they
*NL*
wanted
her
,
that
she
belonged
here
.
In
city
shops
she
was
merely
A
*NL*
Customer
--
a
hat
,
a
voice
to
bore
a
harassed
clerk
.
Here
she
was
Mrs.
Doc
*NL*
Kennicott
,
and
her
preferences
in
grape-fruit
and
manners
were
known
*NL*
and
remembered
and
worth
discussing
...
even
if
they
were
n't
worth
*NL*
fulfilling
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shopping
was
a
delight
of
brisk
conferences
.
The
very
merchants
whose
*NL*
droning
she
found
the
dullest
at
the
two
or
three
parties
which
were
*NL*
given
to
welcome
her
were
the
pleasantest
confidants
of
all
when
they
*NL*
had
something
to
talk
about
--
lemons
or
cotton
voile
or
floor-oil
.
*NL*
With
that
skip-jack
Dave
Dyer
,
the
druggist
,
she
conducted
a
long
*NL*
mock-quarrel
.
She
pretended
that
he
cheated
her
in
the
price
of
*NL*
magazines
and
candy
;
he
pretended
she
was
a
detective
from
the
Twin
*NL*
Cities
.
He
hid
behind
the
prescription-counter
,
and
when
she
stamped
*NL*
her
foot
he
came
out
wailing
,
``
Honest
,
I
have
n't
done
nothing
crooked
*NL*
today
--
not
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
recalled
her
first
impression
of
Main
Street
;
never
*NL*
had
precisely
the
same
despair
at
its
ugliness
.
By
the
end
of
two
*NL*
shopping-tours
everything
had
changed
proportions
.
As
she
never
entered
*NL*
it
,
the
Minniemashie
House
ceased
to
exist
for
her
.
Clark
's
Hardware
*NL*
Store
,
Dyer
's
Drug
Store
,
the
groceries
of
Ole
Jenson
and
Frederick
*NL*
Ludelmeyer
and
Howland
&
Gould
,
the
meat
markets
,
the
notions
*NL*
shop
--
they
expanded
,
and
hid
all
other
structures
.
When
she
entered
Mr.
*NL*
Ludelmeyer
's
store
and
he
wheezed
,
``
Goot
mornin
'
,
Mrs.
Kennicott
.
Vell
,
*NL*
dis
iss
a
fine
day
,
''
she
did
not
notice
the
dustiness
of
the
shelves
*NL*
nor
the
stupidity
of
the
girl
clerk
;
and
she
did
not
remember
the
mute
*NL*
colloquy
with
him
on
her
first
view
of
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
find
half
the
kinds
of
food
she
wanted
,
but
that
made
*NL*
shopping
more
of
an
adventure
.
When
she
did
contrive
to
get
sweetbreads
*NL*
at
Dahl
&
Oleson
's
Meat
Market
the
triumph
was
so
vast
that
she
buzzed
*NL*
with
excitement
and
admired
the
strong
wise
butcher
,
Mr.
Dahl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
appreciated
the
homely
ease
of
village
life
.
She
liked
the
old
men
,
*NL*
farmers
,
G.A.R.
veterans
,
who
when
they
gossiped
sometimes
squatted
on
*NL*
their
heels
on
the
sidewalk
,
like
resting
Indians
,
and
reflectively
spat
*NL*
over
the
curb
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
beauty
in
the
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
suspected
that
her
married
friends
exaggerated
their
passion
*NL*
for
children
.
But
in
her
work
in
the
library
,
children
had
become
*NL*
individuals
to
her
,
citizens
of
the
State
with
their
own
rights
and
*NL*
their
own
senses
of
humor
.
In
the
library
she
had
not
had
much
time
*NL*
to
give
them
,
but
now
she
knew
the
luxury
of
stopping
,
gravely
asking
*NL*
Bessie
Clark
whether
her
doll
had
yet
recovered
from
its
rheumatism
,
and
*NL*
agreeing
with
Oscar
Martinsen
that
it
would
be
Good
Fun
to
go
trapping
*NL*
``
mushrats
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
touched
the
thought
,
``
It
would
be
sweet
to
have
a
baby
of
my
own
.
I
*NL*
do
want
one
.
Tiny
--
No
!
Not
yet
!
There
's
so
much
to
do
.
And
I
'm
still
*NL*
tired
from
the
job
.
It
's
in
my
bones
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rested
at
home
.
She
listened
to
the
village
noises
common
to
all
*NL*
the
world
,
jungle
or
prairie
;
sounds
simple
and
charged
with
magic
--
dogs
*NL*
barking
,
chickens
making
a
gurgling
sound
of
content
,
children
at
play
,
*NL*
a
man
beating
a
rug
,
wind
in
the
cottonwood
trees
,
a
locust
fiddling
,
*NL*
a
footstep
on
the
walk
,
jaunty
voices
of
Bea
and
a
grocer
's
boy
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
a
clinking
anvil
,
a
piano
--
not
too
near
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
a
week
,
at
least
,
she
drove
into
the
country
with
Kennicott
,
to
*NL*
hunt
ducks
in
lakes
enameled
with
sunset
,
or
to
call
on
patients
who
*NL*
looked
up
to
her
as
the
squire
's
lady
and
thanked
her
for
toys
and
*NL*
magazines
.
Evenings
she
went
with
her
husband
to
the
motion
pictures
and
*NL*
was
boisterously
greeted
by
every
other
couple
;
or
,
till
it
became
too
*NL*
cold
,
they
sat
on
the
porch
,
bawling
to
passers-by
in
motors
,
or
to
*NL*
neighbors
who
were
raking
the
leaves
.
The
dust
became
golden
in
the
low
*NL*
sun
;
the
street
was
filled
with
the
fragrance
of
burning
leaves
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
hazily
wanted
some
one
to
whom
she
could
say
what
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
slow
afternoon
when
she
fidgeted
over
sewing
and
wished
that
the
*NL*
telephone
would
ring
,
Bea
announced
Miss
Vida
Sherwin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
Vida
Sherwin
's
lively
blue
eyes
,
if
you
had
looked
at
her
in
*NL*
detail
you
would
have
found
her
face
slightly
lined
,
and
not
so
much
*NL*
sallow
as
with
the
bloom
rubbed
off
;
you
would
have
found
her
chest
*NL*
flat
,
and
her
fingers
rough
from
needle
and
chalk
and
penholder
;
her
*NL*
blouses
and
plain
cloth
skirts
undistinguished
;
and
her
hat
worn
too
far
*NL*
back
,
betraying
a
dry
forehead
.
But
you
never
did
look
at
Vida
Sherwin
*NL*
in
detail
.
You
could
n't
.
Her
electric
activity
veiled
her
.
She
was
as
*NL*
energetic
as
a
chipmunk
.
Her
fingers
fluttered
;
her
sympathy
came
out
*NL*
in
spurts
;
she
sat
on
the
edge
of
a
chair
in
eagerness
to
be
near
her
*NL*
auditor
,
to
send
her
enthusiasms
and
optimism
across
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rushed
into
the
room
pouring
out
:
``
I
'm
afraid
you
'll
think
the
*NL*
teachers
have
been
shabby
in
not
coming
near
you
,
but
we
wanted
to
*NL*
give
you
a
chance
to
get
settled
.
I
am
Vida
Sherwin
,
and
I
try
to
teach
*NL*
French
and
English
and
a
few
other
things
in
the
high
school
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
hoping
to
know
the
teachers
.
You
see
,
I
was
a
librarian
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
you
need
n't
tell
me
.
I
know
all
about
you
!
Awful
how
much
I
*NL*
know
--
this
gossipy
village
.
We
need
you
so
much
here
.
It
's
a
dear
loyal
*NL*
town
-LRB-
and
is
n't
loyalty
the
finest
thing
in
the
world
!
-RRB-
but
it
's
a
*NL*
rough
diamond
,
and
we
need
you
for
the
polishing
,
and
we
're
ever
so
*NL*
humble
--
''
She
stopped
for
breath
and
finished
her
compliment
with
a
*NL*
smile
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
COULD
help
you
in
any
way
--
Would
I
be
committing
the
*NL*
unpardonable
sin
if
I
whispered
that
I
think
Gopher
Prairie
is
a
tiny
*NL*
bit
ugly
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
it
's
ugly
.
Dreadfully
!
Though
I
'm
probably
the
only
person
in
*NL*
town
to
whom
you
could
safely
say
that
.
-LRB-
Except
perhaps
Guy
Pollock
*NL*
the
lawyer
--
have
you
met
him
?
--
oh
,
you
MUST
!
--
he
's
simply
a
*NL*
darling
--
intelligence
and
culture
and
so
gentle
.
-RRB-
But
I
do
n't
care
so
*NL*
much
about
the
ugliness
.
That
will
change
.
It
's
the
spirit
that
gives
*NL*
me
hope
.
It
's
sound
.
Wholesome
.
But
afraid
.
It
needs
live
creatures
like
*NL*
you
to
awaken
it

I
shall
slave-drive
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid

What
shall
I
do

I
've
been
wondering
if
it
would

possible

to
have
a
good
architect
come
here
to
lecture

*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es

do
n't
you
think
it
would
be
better
to
work
with
existing

agencies

Perhaps
it
will
sound
slow
to
you

but
I
was
thinking

It
*NL*
would
be
lovely
if
we
could
get
you
to
teach
Sunday
School

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
the
empty
expression
of
one
who
finds
that
she
has
been
*NL*
affectionately
bowing
to
a
complete
stranger
.
``
Oh
yes

But
I
'm
afraid
I
*NL*
would

be

good

foggy

*NL*
``

I
do
stick

firmly
to
the
belief
in
the
fatherhood

the
brotherhood

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
looked
respectable
and
thought
about
having
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
that
's
all
you
need
teach

School

be

useful

there

*NL*
``

read

*NL*
Miss
Sherwin
shrugged
.
``
Perhaps

still

they
are
so
earnest

They
*NL*
will
respond

your
fresher
interest

the
Thanatopsis
does
do
a

good
social
work

so
many

they
run
the
rest-room
for

such
an

interest

in
fact

so
very
unique

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
disappointed
--
by
nothing
very
tangible
.
She
said
politely
,
*NL*
``
I
'll
think
them
all
over

I
must
have
a
while
to
look
around
first

Miss
Sherwin
darted
to
her
,
smoothed
her
hair
,
peered
at
her
.
``
Oh

*NL*
my

do

you
suppose
I
know

These
first
tender
days

marriage

they
're
sacred
to
me

children

need
you

depend
on
you
to
keep
them
alive

and
turn
to
you
with
their
wrinkly
*NL*
little
smiles

And
the
hearth
and
--
''
She
hid
her
face
from
Carol
as
*NL*
she
made
an
activity
of
patting
the
cushion
of
her
chair
,
but
she
went
*NL*
on
with
her
former
briskness
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
mean
,
you
must
help
us
when
you
're
ready

I
'm
afraid
you
'll

'm
conservative

much

conserve

All
this
treasure
of

ideals

Sturdiness

overwhelming
belief
in

a
tiny
effect

haughty
ten-thousandaires

*NL*
Ensued
a
fifteen-minute
argument
about
the
oldest
topic
in
the
world
:
*NL*
It
's
art
but
is
it
pretty
?
Carol
tried
to
be
eloquent
regarding
honesty
*NL*
of
observation
.
Miss
Sherwin
stood
out
for
sweetness
and
a
cautious
use
*NL*
of
the
uncomfortable
properties
of
light
.
At
the
end
Carol
cried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
care
how
much
we
disagree
.
It
's
a
relief
to
have
somebody
*NL*
talk
something
besides
crops
.
Let
's
make
Gopher
Prairie
rock
to
its
*NL*
foundations
:
let
's
have
afternoon
tea
instead
of
afternoon
coffee
.

The
delighted
Bea
helped
her
bring
out
the
ancestral
folding
*NL*
sewing-table
,
whose
yellow
and
black
top
was
scarred
with
dotted
lines
*NL*
from
a
dressmaker
's
tracing-wheel
,
and
to
set
it
with
an
embroidered
*NL*
lunch-cloth
,
and
the
mauve-glazed
Japanese
tea-set
which
she
had
brought
*NL*
from
St.
Paul
.
Miss
Sherwin
confided
her
latest
scheme
--
moral
motion
*NL*
pictures
for
country
districts
,
with
light
from
a
portable
dynamo
*NL*
hitched
to
a
Ford
engine
.
Bea
was
twice
called
to
fill
the
hot-water
*NL*
pitcher
and
to
make
cinnamon
toast
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Kennicott
came
home
at
five
he
tried
to
be
courtly
,
as
befits
the
*NL*
husband
of
one
who
has
afternoon
tea
.
Carol
suggested
that
Miss
Sherwin
*NL*
stay
for
supper
,
and
that
Kennicott
invite
Guy
Pollock
,
the
much-praised
*NL*
lawyer
,
the
poetic
bachelor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
,
Pollock
could
come
.
Yes
,
he
was
over
the
grippe
which
had
prevented
*NL*
his
going
to
Sam
Clark
's
party
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
regretted
her
impulse
.
The
man
would
be
an
opinionated
politician
,
*NL*
heavily
jocular
about
The
Bride
.
But
at
the
entrance
of
Guy
Pollock
she
*NL*
discovered
a
personality
.
Pollock
was
a
man
of
perhaps
thirty-eight
,
*NL*
slender
,
still
,
deferential
.
His
voice
was
low
.
``
It
was
very
good
of
you
*NL*
to
want
me
,
''
he
said
,
and
he
offered
no
humorous
remarks
,
and
did
not
*NL*
ask
her
if
she
did
n't
think
Gopher
Prairie
was
``
the
livest
little
burg
*NL*
in
the
state
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
fancied
that
his
even
grayness
might
reveal
a
thousand
tints
of
*NL*
lavender
and
blue
and
silver
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
supper
he
hinted
his
love
for
Sir
Thomas
Browne
,
Thoreau
,
Agnes
*NL*
Repplier
,
Arthur
Symons
,
Claude
Washburn
,
Charles
Flandrau
.
He
presented
*NL*
his
idols
diffidently
,
but
he
expanded
in
Carol
's
bookishness
,
in
Miss
*NL*
Sherwin
's
voluminous
praise
,
in
Kennicott
's
tolerance
of
any
one
who
*NL*
amused
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
wondered
why
Guy
Pollock
went
on
digging
at
routine
law-cases
;
*NL*
why
he
remained
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
had
no
one
whom
she
could
ask
.
*NL*
Neither
Kennicott
nor
Vida
Sherwin
would
understand
that
there
might
be
*NL*
reasons
why
a
Pollock
should
not
remain
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
enjoyed
*NL*
the
faint
mystery
.
She
felt
triumphant
and
rather
literary
.
She
already
*NL*
had
a
Group
.
It
would
be
only
a
while
now
before
she
provided
the
town
*NL*
with
fanlights
and
a
knowledge
of
Galsworthy
.
She
was
doing
things
!
As
*NL*
she
served
the
emergency
dessert
of
cocoanut
and
sliced
oranges
,
she
*NL*
cried
to
Pollock
,
``
Do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
get
up
a
dramatic
club
?

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
the
first
dubious
November
snow
had
filtered
down
,
shading
with
*NL*
white
the
bare
clods
in
the
plowed
fields
,
when
the
first
small
fire
*NL*
had
been
started
in
the
furnace
,
which
is
the
shrine
of
a
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
home
,
Carol
began
to
make
the
house
her
own
.
She
dismissed
the
parlor
*NL*
furniture
--
the
golden
oak
table
with
brass
knobs
,
the
moldy
brocade
*NL*
chairs
,
the
picture
of
``
The
Doctor
.
''
She
went
to
Minneapolis
,
to
scamper
*NL*
through
department
stores
and
small
Tenth
Street
shops
devoted
to
*NL*
ceramics
and
high
thought
.
She
had
to
ship
her
treasures
,
but
she
wanted
*NL*
to
bring
them
back
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carpenters
had
torn
out
the
partition
between
front
parlor
and
back
*NL*
parlor
,
thrown
it
into
a
long
room
on
which
she
lavished
yellow
and
*NL*
deep
blue
;
a
Japanese
obi
with
an
intricacy
of
gold
thread
on
stiff
*NL*
ultramarine
tissue
,
which
she
hung
as
a
panel
against
the
maize
wall
;
a
*NL*
couch
with
pillows
of
sapphire
velvet
and
gold
bands
;
chairs
which
,
in
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
,
seemed
flippant
.
She
hid
the
sacred
family
phonograph
in
*NL*
the
dining-room
,
and
replaced
its
stand
with
a
square
cabinet
on
which
*NL*
was
a
squat
blue
jar
between
yellow
candles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
decided
against
a
fireplace
.
``
We
'll
have
a
new
house
in
a
*NL*
couple
of
years
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
decorated
only
one
room
.
The
rest
,
Kennicott
hinted
,
she
'd
better
*NL*
leave
till
he
``
made
a
ten-strike
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
brown
cube
of
a
house
stirred
and
awakened
;
it
seemed
to
be
in
*NL*
motion
;
it
welcomed
her
back
from
shopping
;
it
lost
its
mildewed
*NL*
repression
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
supreme
verdict
was
Kennicott
's
``
Well
,
by
golly
,
I
was
afraid
the
*NL*
new
junk
would
n't
be
so
comfortable
,
but
I
must
say
this
divan
,
or
*NL*
whatever
you
call
it
,
is
a
lot
better
than
that
bumpy
old
sofa
we
had
,
*NL*
and
when
I
look
around
--
Well
,
it
's
worth
all
it
cost
,
I
guess
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
in
town
took
an
interest
in
the
refurnishing
.
The
carpenters
*NL*
and
painters
who
did
not
actually
assist
crossed
the
lawn
to
peer
*NL*
through
the
windows
and
exclaim
,
``
Fine
!
Looks
swell
!
''
Dave
Dyer
at
*NL*
the
drug
store
,
Harry
Haydock
and
Raymie
Wutherspoon
at
the
Bon
Ton
,
*NL*
repeated
daily
,
``
How
's
the
good
work
coming
?
I
hear
the
house
is
getting
*NL*
to
be
real
classy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
Mrs.
Bogart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
lived
across
the
alley
from
the
rear
of
Carol
's
house
.
She
*NL*
was
a
widow
,
and
a
Prominent
Baptist
,
and
a
Good
Influence
.
She
had
so
*NL*
painfully
reared
three
sons
to
be
Christian
gentlemen
that
one
of
them
*NL*
had
become
an
Omaha
bartender
,
one
a
professor
of
Greek
,
and
one
,
Cyrus
*NL*
N.
Bogart
,
a
boy
of
fourteen
who
was
still
at
home
,
the
most
brazen
*NL*
member
of
the
toughest
gang
in
Boytown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
was
not
the
acid
type
of
Good
Influence
.
She
was
the
soft
,
*NL*
damp
,
fat
,
sighing
,
indigestive
,
clinging
,
melancholy
,
depressingly
*NL*
hopeful
kind
.
There
are
in
every
large
chicken-yard
a
number
of
old
and
*NL*
indignant
hens
who
resemble
Mrs.
Bogart
,
and
when
they
are
served
at
*NL*
Sunday
noon
dinner
,
as
fricasseed
chicken
with
thick
dumplings
,
they
*NL*
keep
up
the
resemblance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
noted
that
Mrs.
Bogart
from
her
side
window
kept
an
eye
upon
*NL*
the
house
.
The
Kennicotts
and
Mrs.
Bogart
did
not
move
in
the
same
*NL*
sets
--
which
meant
precisely
the
same
in
Gopher
Prairie
as
it
did
on
*NL*
Fifth
Avenue
or
in
Mayfair
.
But
the
good
widow
came
calling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wheezed
in
,
sighed
,
gave
Carol
a
pulpy
hand
,
sighed
,
glanced
sharply
*NL*
at
the
revelation
of
ankles
as
Carol
crossed
her
legs
,
sighed
,
inspected
*NL*
the
new
blue
chairs
,
smiled
with
a
coy
sighing
sound
,
and
gave
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
wanted
to
call
on
you
so
long
,
dearie
,
you
know
we
're
neighbors
,
*NL*
but
I
thought
I
'd
wait
till
you
got
settled
,
you
must
run
in
and
see
me
,
*NL*
how
much
did
that
big
chair
cost
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seventy-seven
dollars
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sev
--
Sakes
alive
!
Well
,
I
suppose
it
's
all
right
for
them
that
can
*NL*
afford
it
,
though
I
do
sometimes
think
--
Of
course
as
our
pastor
said
*NL*
once
,
at
Baptist
Church
--
By
the
way
,
we
have
n't
seen
you
there
yet
,
*NL*
and
of
course
your
husband
was
raised
up
a
Baptist
,
and
I
do
hope
*NL*
he
wo
n't
drift
away
from
the
fold
,
of
course
we
all
know
there
is
n't
*NL*
anything
,
not
cleverness
or
gifts
of
gold
or
anything
,
that
can
make
*NL*
up
for
humility
and
the
inward
grace
and
they
can
say
what
they
want
to
*NL*
about
the
P.
E.
church
,
but
of
course
there
's
no
church
that
has
more
*NL*
history
or
has
stayed
by
the
true
principles
of
Christianity
better
*NL*
than
the
Baptist
Church
and
--
In
what
church
were
you
raised
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
W-why
,
I
went
to
Congregational
,
as
a
girl
in
Mankato
,
but
my
college
*NL*
was
Universalist
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
But
of
course
as
the
Bible
says
,
is
it
the
Bible
,
at
least
I
*NL*
know
I
have
heard
it
in
church
and
everybody
admits
it
,
it
's
proper
for
*NL*
the
little
bride
to
take
her
husband
's
vessel
of
faith
,
so
we
all
hope
*NL*
we
shall
see
you
at
the
Baptist
Church
and
--
As
I
was
saying
,
of
course
*NL*
I
agree
with
Reverend
Zitterel
in
thinking
that
the
great
trouble
with
*NL*
this
nation
today
is
lack
of
spiritual
faith
--
so
few
going
to
church
,
*NL*
and
people
automobiling
on
Sunday
and
heaven
knows
what
all
.
But
still
*NL*
I
do
think
that
one
trouble
is
this
terrible
waste
of
money
,
people
*NL*
feeling
that
they
've
got
to
have
bath-tubs
and
telephones
in
their
*NL*
houses

heard
you
were
selling
the
old
furniture
cheap

Yes

``
Well

of

you
know
your

I
ca

Will

ma

down
here

there

there

I
must
n't
croak

I
just
wanted
to
let
you
know
that
when
you
find
you

ca
n't
depend
on
a

gadding
young
folks
like
the
Haydocks

the
Dyers

heaven
only
knows
how
much
money
Juanita
Haydock
blows
in

why
then
you
may
be
glad

always
right
there

any

quarreling

wasting
money

all
that
so
many

do
have

be
running
along
now

It
was
twenty
minutes
later
when
Mrs.
Bogart
finally
oozed
out

the

front
door

Carol
ran
back
into

jerked
open

windows

extravagant

at

she
did
not
try
to
clear
herself
of

blame
by
going
about
whimpering
,
``
I
know
I
'm
terribly
extravagant
but
I
*NL*
do
n't
seem
to
be
able
to
help

''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
never
thought
of
giving
her
an
allowance
.
His
mother
had
*NL*
never
had
one
!
As
a
wage-earning
spinster
Carol
had
asserted
to
her
*NL*
fellow
librarians
that
when
she
was
married
,
she
was
going
to
have
an
*NL*
allowance
and
be
business-like
and
modern
.
But
it
was
too
much
trouble
*NL*
to
explain
to
Kennicott
's
kindly
stubbornness
that
she
was
a
practical
*NL*
housekeeper
as
well
as
a
flighty
playmate
.
She
bought
a
budget-plan
*NL*
account
book
and
made
her
budgets
as
exact
as
budgets
are
likely
to
be
*NL*
when
they
lack
budgets
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
month
it
was
a
honeymoon
jest
to
beg
prettily
,
to
confess
,
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
a
cent
in
the
house
,
dear
,
''
and
to
be
told
,
``
You
're
an
*NL*
extravagant
little
rabbit
.
''
But
the
budget
book
made
her
realize
how
*NL*
inexact
were
her
finances
.
She
became
self-conscious
;
occasionally
she
*NL*
was
indignant
that
she
should
always
have
to
petition
him
for
the
money
*NL*
with
which
to
buy
his
food
.
She
caught
herself
criticizing
his
belief
*NL*
that
,
since
his
joke
about
trying
to
keep
her
out
of
the
poorhouse
had
*NL*
once
been
accepted
as
admirable
humor
,
it
should
continue
to
be
his
*NL*
daily
bon
mot
.
It
was
a
nuisance
to
have
to
run
down
the
street
after
*NL*
him
because
she
had
forgotten
to
ask
him
for
money
at
breakfast
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
could
n't
``
hurt
his
feelings
,
''
she
reflected
.
He
liked
the
*NL*
lordliness
of
giving
largess
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
reduce
the
frequency
of
begging
by
opening
accounts
and
*NL*
having
the
bills
sent
to
him
.
She
had
found
that
staple
groceries
,
*NL*
sugar
,
flour
,
could
be
most
cheaply
purchased
at
Axel
Egge
's
rustic
*NL*
general
store
.
She
said
sweetly
to
Axel
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
'd
better
open
a
charge
account
here

*NL*
She
flared
,
``
Do
you
know
who
I
am

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yuh

I

*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
at
his
red
impassive
face
,
and
her
fingers
had
the
*NL*
undignified
desire
to
slap
him
,
but
her
reason
agreed
with
him
.
``
You
're
*NL*
quite
right
.
You
should
n't
break
your
rule
for
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
rage
had
not
been
lost
.
It
had
been
transferred
to
her
husband
.
She
*NL*
wanted
ten
pounds
of
sugar
in
a
hurry
,
but
she
had
no
money
.
She
ran
up
*NL*
the
stairs
to
Kennicott
's
office
.
On
the
door
was
a
sign
advertising
a
*NL*
headache
cure
and
stating
,
``
The
doctor
is
out
,
back
at
--
''
Naturally
,
*NL*
the
blank
space
was
not
filled
out
.
She
stamped
her
foot
.
She
ran
down
*NL*
to
the
drug
store
--
the
doctor
's
club
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
entered
she
heard
Mrs.
Dyer
demanding
,
``
Dave
,
I
've
got
to
have
*NL*
some
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
saw
that
her
husband
was
there
,
and
two
other
men
,
all
listening
*NL*
in
amusement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dave
Dyer
snapped
,
``
How
much
do
you
want
?
Dollar
be
enough
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
wo
n't
!
I
've
got
to
get
some
underclothes
for
the
kids

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
good
Lord
,
they
got
enough
now
to
fill
the
closet

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

They
're
all
in

You
got
to
give
me
ten
dollars

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
perceived
that
Mrs.
Dyer
was
accustomed
to
this
indignity
.
She
*NL*
perceived
that
the
men
,
particularly
Dave
,
regarded
it
as
an
excellent
*NL*
jest
.
She
waited
--
she
knew
what
would
come
--
it
did
.
Dave
yelped
,
*NL*
``
Where
's
that
ten
dollars
I
gave
you
last
year
?
''
and
he
looked
to
the
*NL*
other
men
to
laugh
.
They
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cold
and
still
,
Carol
walked
up
to
Kennicott
and
commanded
,
``
I
want
to
*NL*
see
you
upstairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
something
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
clumped
after
her
,
up
the
stairs
,
into
his
barren
office
.
Before
he
*NL*
could
get
out
a
query
she
stated
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yesterday
,
in
front
of
a
saloon
,
I
heard
a
German
farm-wife
beg
her
*NL*
husband
for
a
quarter
,
to
get
a
toy
for
the
baby
--
and
he
refused
.
Just
*NL*
now
I
've
heard
Mrs.
Dyer
going
through
the
same
humiliation
.
And
I
--
I
'm
*NL*
in
the
same
position
!
I
have
to
beg
you
for
money
.
Daily
!
I
have
just
*NL*
been
informed
that
I
could
n't
have
any
sugar
because
I
had
n't
the
money
*NL*
to
pay
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
said
that
?
By
God
,
I
'll
kill
any
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Tut
.
It
was
n't
his
fault
.
It
was
yours
.
And
mine
.
I
now
humbly
beg
*NL*
you
to
give
me
the
money
with
which
to
buy
meals
for
you
to
eat
.
And
*NL*
hereafter
to
remember
it
.
The
next
time
,
I
sha
'n'
t
beg
.
I
shall
simply
*NL*
starve
.
Do
you
understand
?
I
ca
n't
go
on
being
a
slave
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
defiance
,
her
enjoyment
of
the
role
,
ran
out
.
She
was
sobbing
*NL*
against
his
overcoat
,
``
How
can
you
shame
me
so
?
''
and
he
was
blubbering
,
*NL*
``
Dog-gone
it
,
I
meant
to
give
you
some
,
and
I
forgot
it

I
swear
I
wo
n't
*NL*
again
.
By
golly
I
wo
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
pressed
fifty
dollars
upon
her
,
and
after
that
he
remembered
to
give
*NL*
her
money
regularly
...
sometimes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daily
she
determined
,
``
But
I
must
have
a
stated
amount
--
be
*NL*
business-like
.
System
.
I
must
do
something
about
it

And
daily
she
*NL*
did
n't
do
anything
about
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
had
,
by
the
simpering
viciousness
of
her
comments
on
the
new
*NL*
furniture
,
stirred
Carol
to
economy
.
She
spoke
judiciously
to
Bea
*NL*
about
left-overs
.
She
read
the
cookbook
again
and
,
like
a
child
with
*NL*
a
picture-book
,
she
studied
the
diagram
of
the
beef
which
gallantly
*NL*
continues
to
browse
though
it
is
divided
into
cuts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
was
a
deliberate
and
joyous
spendthrift
in
her
preparations
for
*NL*
her
first
party
,
the
housewarming
.
She
made
lists
on
every
envelope
*NL*
and
laundry-slip
in
her
desk
.
She
sent
orders
to
Minneapolis
``
fancy
*NL*
grocers
.
''
She
pinned
patterns
and
sewed
.
She
was
irritated
when
*NL*
Kennicott
was
jocular
about
``
these
frightful
big
doings
that
are
going
*NL*
on
.
''
She
regarded
the
affair
as
an
attack
on
Gopher
Prairie
's
timidity
*NL*
in
pleasure
.
``
I
'll
make
'em
lively
,
if
nothing
else
.
I
'll
make
'em
stop
*NL*
regarding
parties
as
committee-meetings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
usually
considered
himself
the
master
of
the
house
.
At
his
*NL*
desire
,
she
went
hunting
,
which
was
his
symbol
of
happiness
,
and
she
*NL*
ordered
porridge
for
breakfast
,
which
was
his
symbol
of
morality
.
But
*NL*
when
he
came
home
on
the
afternoon
before
the
housewarming
he
found
*NL*
himself
a
slave
,
an
intruder
,
a
blunderer
.
Carol
wailed
,
``
Fix
the
*NL*
furnace
so
you
wo
n't
have
to
touch
it
after
supper
.
And
for
heaven
's
*NL*
sake
take
that
horrible
old
door-mat
off
the
porch
.
And
put
on
your
nice
*NL*
brown
and
white
shirt
.
Why
did
you
come
home
so
late
?
Would
you
mind
*NL*
hurrying
?
Here
it
is
almost
suppertime
,
and
those
fiends
are
just
as
*NL*
likely
as
not
to
come
at
seven
instead
of
eight
.
PLEASE
hurry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
as
unreasonable
as
an
amateur
leading
woman
on
a
first
night
,
*NL*
and
he
was
reduced
to
humility
.
When
she
came
down
to
supper
,
when
she
*NL*
stood
in
the
doorway
,
he
gasped
.
She
was
in
a
silver
sheath
,
the
calyx
*NL*
of
a
lily
,
her
piled
hair
like
black
glass
;
she
had
the
fragility
and
*NL*
costliness
of
a
Viennese
goblet
;
and
her
eyes
were
intense
.
He
was
*NL*
stirred
to
rise
from
the
table
and
to
hold
the
chair
for
her
;
and
all
*NL*
through
supper
he
ate
his
bread
dry
because
he
felt
that
she
would
think
*NL*
him
common
if
he
said
``
Will
you
hand
me
the
butter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
reached
the
calmness
of
not
caring
whether
her
guests
liked
*NL*
the
party
or
not
,
and
a
state
of
satisfied
suspense
in
regard
to
Bea
's
*NL*
technique
in
serving
,
before
Kennicott
cried
from
the
bay-window
in
*NL*
the
living-room
,
``
Here
comes
somebody
!
''
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Luke
Dawson
*NL*
faltered
in
,
at
a
quarter
to
eight
.
Then
in
a
shy
avalanche
arrived
*NL*
the
entire
aristocracy
of
Gopher
Prairie
:
all
persons
engaged
in
a
*NL*
profession
,
or
earning
more
than
twenty-five
hundred
dollars
a
year
,
or
*NL*
possessed
of
grandparents
born
in
America
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
while
they
were
removing
their
overshoes
they
were
peeping
at
the
*NL*
new
decorations
.
Carol
saw
Dave
Dyer
secretively
turn
over
the
gold
*NL*
pillows
to
find
a
price-tag
,
and
heard
Mr.
Julius
Flickerbaugh
,
the
*NL*
attorney
,
gasp
,
``
Well
,
I
'll
be
switched
,
''
as
he
viewed
the
vermilion
*NL*
print
hanging
against
the
Japanese
obi
.
She
was
amused
.
But
her
high
*NL*
spirits
slackened
as
she
beheld
them
form
in
dress
parade
,
in
a
long
,
*NL*
silent
,
uneasy
circle
clear
round
the
living-room
.
She
felt
that
she
had
*NL*
been
magically
whisked
back
to
her
first
party
,
at
Sam
Clark
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
got
to
lift
them
,
like
so
many
pigs
of
iron
?
I
do
n't
know
that
I
*NL*
can
make
them
happy
,
but
I
'll
make
them
hectic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
silver
flame
in
the
darkling
circle
,
she
whirled
around
,
drew
them
*NL*
with
her
smile
,
and
sang
,
``
I
want
my
party
to
be
noisy
and
undignified
!
*NL*
This
is
the
christening
of
my
house
,
and
I
want
you
to
help
me
have
a
*NL*
bad
influence
on
it
,
so
that
it
will
be
a
giddy
house
.
For
me
,
wo
n't
you
*NL*
all
join
in
an
old-fashioned
square
dance
?
And
Mr.
Dyer
will
call
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
record
on
the
phonograph
;
Dave
Dyer
was
capering
in
the
center
*NL*
of
the
floor
,
loose-jointed
,
lean
,
small
,
rusty
headed
,
pointed
of
nose
,
*NL*
clapping
his
hands
and
shouting
,
``
Swing
y
'
pardners
--
alamun
lef
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
the
millionaire
Dawsons
and
Ezra
Stowbody
and
``
Professor
''
George
*NL*
Edwin
Mott
danced
,
looking
only
slightly
foolish
;
and
by
rushing
about
*NL*
the
room
and
being
coy
and
coaxing
to
all
persons
over
forty-five
,
Carol
*NL*
got
them
into
a
waltz
and
a
Virginia
Reel
.
But
when
she
left
them
to
*NL*
disenjoy
themselves
in
their
own
way
Harry
Haydock
put
a
one-step
record
*NL*
on
the
phonograph
,
the
younger
people
took
the
floor
,
and
all
the
elders
*NL*
sneaked
back
to
their
chairs
,
with
crystallized
smiles
which
meant
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
believe
I
'll
try
this
one
myself
,
but
I
do
enjoy
watching
the
*NL*
youngsters
dance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Half
of
them
were
silent
;
half
resumed
the
discussions
of
that
afternoon
*NL*
in
the
store
.
Ezra
Stowbody
hunted
for
something
to
say
,
hid
a
yawn
,
and
*NL*
offered
to
Lyman
Cass
,
the
owner
of
the
flour-mill
,
``
How
d'
you
folks
*NL*
like
the
new
furnace
,
Lym
?
Huh
?
So
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
them
alone
.
Do
n't
pester
them
.
They
must
like
it
,
or
they
*NL*
would
n't
do
it
.
''
Carol
warned
herself
.
But
they
gazed
at
her
so
*NL*
expectantly
when
she
flickered
past
that
she
was
reconvinced
that
in
*NL*
their
debauches
of
respectability
they
had
lost
the
power
of
play
as
*NL*
well
as
the
power
of
impersonal
thought
.
Even
the
dancers
were
gradually
*NL*
crushed
by
the
invisible
force
of
fifty
perfectly
pure
and
well-behaved
*NL*
and
negative
minds
;
and
they
sat
down
,
two
by
two
.
In
twenty
minutes
the
*NL*
party
was
again
elevated
to
the
decorum
of
a
prayer-meeting
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
going
to
do
something
exciting
,
''
Carol
exclaimed
to
her
new
*NL*
confidante
,
Vida
Sherwin
.
She
saw
that
in
the
growing
quiet
her
voice
*NL*
had
carried
across
the
room
.
Nat
Hicks
,
Ella
Stowbody
,
and
Dave
Dyer
*NL*
were
abstracted
,
fingers
and
lips
slightly
moving
.
She
knew
with
a
*NL*
cold
certainty
that
Dave
was
rehearsing
his
``
stunt
''
about
the
Norwegian
*NL*
catching
the
hen
,
Ella
running
over
the
first
lines
of
``
An
Old
*NL*
Sweetheart
of
Mine
,
''
and
Nat
thinking
of
his
popular
parody
on
Mark
*NL*
Antony
's
oration
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
will
not
have
anybody
use
the
word
`
stunt

in
my
house

''
she
*NL*
whispered
to
Miss
Sherwin
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
good

I
tell
you

why

have
Raymond

sing
?

*NL*
``
Raymie

Why

he
's

most
sentimental
yearner
in
town

*NL*
``
See
here

child
!
Your
opinions
on
house-decorating
are
sound

opinions

Raymie
does
wag
his
tail
.
But
the
poor
*NL*
dear
--
Longing
for
what
he
calls
`
self-expression
'
and
no
training
in
*NL*
anything
except
selling
shoes

But
he
can
sing
.
And
some
day
when
*NL*
he
gets
away
from
Harry
Haydock
's
patronage
and
ridicule
,
he
'll
do
*NL*
something
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
apologized
for
her
superciliousness
.
She
urged
Raymie
,
and
warned
*NL*
the
planners
of
``
stunts
,
''
``
We
all
want
you
to
sing

Mr.
Wutherspoon

only
famous
actor

going
to
let
appear
on
the
stage
*NL*
tonight

*NL*
*NL*
While
Raymie
blushed
and
admitted
,
``
Oh
,
they
do
n't
want
to
hear
me
,
''
he
*NL*
was
clearing
his
throat
,
pulling
his
clean
handkerchief
farther
out
of
*NL*
his
breast
pocket
,
and
thrusting
his
fingers
between
the
buttons
of
his
*NL*
vest
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
affection
for
Raymie
's
defender
,
in
her
desire
to
``
discover
*NL*
artistic
talent
,
''
Carol
prepared
to
be
delighted
by
the
recital
.
*NL*
*NL*
Raymie
sang
``
Fly
as
a
Bird
,
''
``
Thou
Art
My
Dove
,
''
and
``
When
the
Little
*NL*
Swallow
Leaves
Its
Tiny
Nest

''
all
in
a
reasonably
bad
offertory
tenor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
shuddering
with
the
vicarious
shame
which
sensitive
people
*NL*
feel
when
they
listen
to
an
``
elocutionist
''
being
humorous
,
or
to
a
*NL*
precocious
child
publicly
doing
badly
what
no
child
should
do
at
all
.
*NL*
She
wanted
to
laugh
at
the
gratified
importance
in
Raymie
's
half-shut
*NL*
eyes
;
she
wanted
to
weep
over
the
meek
ambitiousness
which
clouded
like
*NL*
an
aura
his
pale
face
,
flap
ears
,
and
sandy
pompadour
.
She
tried
to
look
*NL*
admiring
,
for
the
benefit
of
Miss
Sherwin
,
that
trusting
admirer
of
all
*NL*
that
was
or
conceivably
could
be
the
good
,
the
true
,
and
the
beautiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
end
of
the
third
ornithological
lyric
Miss
Sherwin
roused
from
*NL*
her
attitude
of
inspired
vision
and
breathed
to
Carol
,
``
My
!
That
was
*NL*
sweet
!
Of
course
Raymond
has
n't
an
unusually
good
voice
,
but
do
n't
you
*NL*
think
he
puts
such
a
lot
of
feeling
into
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
lied
blackly
and
magnificently
,
but
without
originality
:
``
Oh
yes
,
*NL*
I
do
think
he
has
so
much
FEELING
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
after
the
strain
of
listening
in
a
cultured
manner
the
*NL*
audience
had
collapsed
;
had
given
up
their
last
hope
of
being
amused
.
*NL*
She
cried
,
``
Now
we
're
going
to
play
an
idiotic
game
which
I
learned
in
*NL*
Chicago
.
You
will
have
to
take
off
your
shoes
,
for
a
starter
!
After
that
*NL*
you
will
probably
break
your
knees
and
shoulder-blades
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Much
attention
and
incredulity
.
A
few
eyebrows
indicating
a
verdict
that
*NL*
Doc
Kennicott
's
bride
was
noisy
and
improper
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
choose
the
most
vicious
,
like
Juanita
Haydock
and
myself
,
as
*NL*
the
shepherds
.
The
rest
of
you
are
wolves
.
Your
shoes
are
the
sheep
.
*NL*
The
wolves
go
out
into
the
hall
.
The
shepherds
scatter
the
sheep
through
*NL*
this
room
,
then
turn
off
all
the
lights
,
and
the
wolves
crawl
in
from
*NL*
the
hall
and
in
the
darkness
they
try
to
get
the
shoes
away
from
*NL*
the
shepherds
--
who
are
permitted
to
do
anything
except
bite
and
use
*NL*
black-jacks
.
The
wolves
chuck
the
captured
shoes
out
into
the
hall
.
No
*NL*
one
excused
!
Come
on
!
Shoes
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Every
one
looked
at
every
one
else
and
waited
for
every
one
else
to
*NL*
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
kicked
off
her
silver
slippers
,
and
ignored
the
universal
glance
*NL*
at
her
arches
.
The
embarrassed
but
loyal
Vida
Sherwin
unbuttoned
her
*NL*
high
black
shoes
.
Ezra
Stowbody
cackled
,
``
Well
,
you
're
a
terror
to
old
*NL*
folks
.
You
're
like
the
gals
I
used
to
go
horseback-riding
with
,
back
in
*NL*
the
sixties
.
Ai
n't
much
accustomed
to
attending
parties
barefoot
,
*NL*
but
here
goes
!
''
With
a
whoop
and
a
gallant
jerk
Ezra
snatched
off
his
*NL*
elastic-sided
Congress
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
giggled
and
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
sheep
had
been
penned
up
,
in
the
darkness
the
timorous
wolves
*NL*
crept
into
the
living-room
,
squealing
,
halting
,
thrown
out
of
their
*NL*
habit
of
stolidity
by
the
strangeness
of
advancing
through
nothingness
*NL*
toward
a
waiting
foe
,
a
mysterious
foe
which
expanded
and
grew
more
*NL*
menacing
.
The
wolves
peered
to
make
out
landmarks
,
they
touched
gliding
*NL*
arms
which
did
not
seem
to
be
attached
to
a
body
,
they
quivered
with
a
*NL*
rapture
of
fear
.
Reality
had
vanished
.
A
yelping
squabble
suddenly
rose
,
*NL*
then
Juanita
Haydock
's
high
titter
,
and
Guy
Pollock
's
astonished
,
``
Ouch
!
*NL*
Quit
!
You
're
scalping
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Luke
Dawson
galloped
backward
on
stiff
hands
and
knees
into
the
*NL*
safety
of
the
lighted
hallway
,
moaning
,
``
I
declare
,
I
nev
'
was
so
*NL*
upset
in
my
life
!
''
But
the
propriety
was
shaken
out
of
her
,
and
she
*NL*
delightedly
continued
to
ejaculate
``
Nev
'
in
my
LIFE
''
as
she
saw
the
*NL*
living-room
door
opened
by
invisible
hands
and
shoes
hurling
through
it
,
*NL*
as
she
heard
from
the
darkness
beyond
the
door
a
squawling
,
a
bumping
,
*NL*
a
resolute
``
Here
's
a
lot
of
shoes
.
Come
on
,
you
wolves
.
Ow
!
Y
'
would
,
*NL*
would
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carol
abruptly
turned
on
the
lights
in
the
embattled
living-room
,
*NL*
half
of
the
company
were
sitting
back
against
the
walls
,
where
they
had
*NL*
craftily
remained
throughout
the
engagement
,
but
in
the
middle
of
the
*NL*
floor
Kennicott
was
wrestling
with
Harry
Haydock
--
their
collars
torn
*NL*
off
,
their
hair
in
their
eyes
;
and
the
owlish
Mr.
Julius
Flickerbaugh
*NL*
was
retreating
from
Juanita
Haydock
,
and
gulping
with
unaccustomed
*NL*
laughter
.
Guy
Pollock
's
discreet
brown
scarf
hung
down
his
back
.
Young
*NL*
Rita
Simons
's
net
blouse
had
lost
two
buttons
,
and
betrayed
more
of
her
*NL*
delicious
plump
shoulder
than
was
regarded
as
pure
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
Whether
by
shock
,
disgust
,
joy
of
combat
,
or
physical
activity
,
all
the
*NL*
party
were
freed
from
their
years
of
social
decorum
.
George
Edwin
Mott
*NL*
giggled
;
Luke
Dawson
twisted
his
beard
;
Mrs.
Clark
insisted
,
``
I
did
too
,
*NL*
Sam
--
I
got
a
shoe
--
I
never
knew
I
could
fight
so
terrible
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
certain
that
she
was
a
great
reformer
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
mercifully
had
combs
,
mirrors
,
brushes
,
needle
and
thread
ready
.
She
*NL*
permitted
them
to
restore
the
divine
decency
of
buttons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grinning
Bea
brought
down-stairs
a
pile
of
soft
thick
sheets
of
*NL*
paper
with
designs
of
lotos
blossoms
,
dragons
,
apes
,
in
cobalt
and
*NL*
crimson
and
gray
,
and
patterns
of
purple
birds
flying
among
sea-green
*NL*
trees
in
the
valleys
of
Nowhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
These
,
''
Carol
announced
,
``
are
real
Chinese
masquerade
costumes
.
I
got
*NL*
them
from
an
importing
shop
in
Minneapolis
.
You
are
to
put
them
on
over
*NL*
your
clothes
,
and
please
forget
that
you
are
Minnesotans
,
and
turn
into
*NL*
mandarins
and
coolies
and
--
and
samurai
-LRB-
is
n't
it
?
-RRB-
,
and
anything
else
*NL*
you
can
think
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
were
shyly
rustling
the
paper
costumes
she
disappeared
.
Ten
*NL*
minutes
after
she
gazed
down
from
the
stairs
upon
grotesquely
ruddy
*NL*
Yankee
heads
above
Oriental
robes
,
and
cried
to
them
,
``
The
Princess
*NL*
Winky
Poo
salutes
her
court
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
looked
up
she
caught
their
suspense
of
admiration
.
They
saw
an
*NL*
airy
figure
in
trousers
and
coat
of
green
brocade
edged
with
gold
;
a
*NL*
high
gold
collar
under
a
proud
chin
;
black
hair
pierced
with
jade
pins
;
*NL*
a
languid
peacock
fan
in
an
out-stretched
hand
;
eyes
uplifted
to
a
*NL*
vision
of
pagoda
towers
.
When
she
dropped
her
pose
and
smiled
down
*NL*
she
discovered
Kennicott
apoplectic
with
domestic
pride
--
and
gray
Guy
*NL*
Pollock
staring
beseechingly
.
For
a
second
she
saw
nothing
in
all
the
*NL*
pink
and
brown
mass
of
their
faces
save
the
hunger
of
the
two
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
off
the
spell
and
ran
down
.
``
We
're
going
to
have
a
real
*NL*
Chinese
concert
.
Messrs.
Pollock
,
Kennicott
,
and
,
well
,
Stowbody
are
*NL*
drummers
;
the
rest
of
us
sing
and
play
the
fife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
fifes
were
combs
with
tissue
paper
;
the
drums
were
tabourets
and
the
*NL*
sewing-table
.
Loren
Wheeler
,
editor
of
the
Dauntless
,
led
the
orchestra
,
*NL*
with
a
ruler
and
a
totally
inaccurate
sense
of
rhythm
.
The
music
was
a
*NL*
reminiscence
of
tom-toms
heard
at
circus
fortune-telling
tents
or
at
*NL*
the
Minnesota
State
Fair
,
but
the
whole
company
pounded
and
puffed
and
*NL*
whined
in
a
sing-song
,
and
looked
rapturous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
were
quite
tired
of
the
concert
Carol
led
them
in
a
dancing
*NL*
procession
to
the
dining-room
,
to
blue
bowls
of
chow
mein
,
with
Lichee
*NL*
nuts
and
ginger
preserved
in
syrup
.
*NL*
*NL*
None
of
them
save
that
city-rounder
Harry
Haydock
had
heard
of
any
*NL*
Chinese
dish
except
chop
sooey
.
With
agreeable
doubt
they
ventured
*NL*
through
the
bamboo
shoots
into
the
golden
fried
noodles
of
the
chow
*NL*
mein
;
and
Dave
Dyer
did
a
not
very
humorous
Chinese
dance
with
Nat
*NL*
Hicks
;
and
there
was
hubbub
and
contentment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
relaxed
,
and
found
that
she
was
shockingly
tired
.
She
had
carried
*NL*
them
on
her
thin
shoulders
.
She
could
not
keep
it
up
.
She
longed
for
*NL*
her
father
,
that
artist
at
creating
hysterical
parties
.
She
thought
of
*NL*
smoking
a
cigarette
,
to
shock
them
,
and
dismissed
the
obscene
thought
*NL*
before
it
was
quite
formed
.
She
wondered
whether
they
could
for
five
*NL*
minutes
be
coaxed
to
talk
about
something
besides
the
winter
top
*NL*
of
Knute
Stamquist
's
Ford
,
and
what
Al
Tingley
had
said
about
his
*NL*
mother-in-law
.
She
sighed
,
``
Oh
,
let
'em
alone
.
I
've
done
enough
.
''
She
*NL*
crossed
her
trousered
legs
,
and
snuggled
luxuriously
above
her
saucer
*NL*
of
ginger
;
she
caught
Pollock
's
congratulatory
still
smile
,
and
thought
*NL*
well
of
herself
for
having
thrown
a
rose
light
on
the
pallid
lawyer
;
*NL*
repented
the
heretical
supposition
that
any
male
save
her
husband
*NL*
existed
;
jumped
up
to
find
Kennicott
and
whisper
,
``
Happy
,
my
lord
?
...
*NL*
No
,
it
did
n't
cost
much
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Best
party
this
town
ever
saw
.
Only
--
Do
n't
cross
your
legs
in
that
*NL*
costume
.
Shows
your
knees
too
plain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
vexed
.
She
resented
his
clumsiness
.
She
returned
to
Guy
Pollock
*NL*
and
talked
of
Chinese
religions
--
not
that
she
knew
anything
whatever
*NL*
about
Chinese
religions
,
but
he
had
read
a
book
on
the
subject
as
,
on
*NL*
lonely
evenings
in
his
office
,
he
had
read
at
least
one
book
on
every
*NL*
subject
in
the
world
.
Guy
's
thin
maturity
was
changing
in
her
vision
*NL*
to
flushed
youth
and
they
were
roaming
an
island
in
the
yellow
sea
of
*NL*
chatter
when
she
realized
that
the
guests
were
beginning
that
cough
*NL*
which
indicated
,
in
the
universal
instinctive
language
,
that
they
*NL*
desired
to
go
home
and
go
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
they
asserted
that
it
had
been
``
the
nicest
party
they
'd
ever
*NL*
seen
--
my
!
so
clever
and
original
,
''
she
smiled
tremendously
,
shook
hands
,
*NL*
and
cried
many
suitable
things
regarding
children
,
and
being
sure
to
*NL*
wrap
up
warmly
,
and
Raymie
's
singing
and
Juanita
Haydock
's
prowess
at
*NL*
games
.
Then
she
turned
wearily
to
Kennicott
in
a
house
filled
with
quiet
*NL*
and
crumbs
and
shreds
of
Chinese
costumes
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gurgling
,
``
I
tell
you
,
Carrie
,
you
certainly
are
a
wonder
,
and
*NL*
guess
you
're
right
about
waking
folks
up
.
Now
you
've
showed
'em
how

*NL*
they
wo

Done

Pop
up

I

clear
up

*NL*
*NL*
His
wise
surgeon
's
-
hands
stroked
her
shoulder
,
and
her
irritation
at
his
*NL*
clumsiness
was
lost
in
his
strength

Wednesday
evening

of
Dr.

completely
redecorated
their

extremely
nifty

The

including

genuine
Oriental

Dainty

CHAPTER

*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
GOPHER
PRAIRIE
was
digging
in
for
the
winter
.
Through
late
November
and
*NL*
all
December
it
snowed
daily
;
the
thermometer
was
at
zero
and
might
*NL*
drop
to
twenty
below
,
or
thirty
.
Winter
is
not
a
season
in
the
North
*NL*
Middlewest
;
it
is
an
industry
.
Storm
sheds
were
erected
at
every
door
.
*NL*
In
every
block
the
householders
,
Sam
Clark
,
the
wealthy
Mr.
Dawson
,
all
*NL*
save
asthmatic
Ezra
Stowbody
who
extravagantly
hired
a
boy
,
were
seen
*NL*
perilously
staggering
up
ladders
,
carrying
storm
windows
and
screwing
*NL*
them
to
second-story
jambs
.
While
Kennicott
put
up
his
windows
Carol
*NL*
danced
inside
the
bedrooms
and
begged
him
not
to
swallow
the
screws
,
*NL*
which
he
held
in
his
mouth
like
an
extraordinary
set
of
external
false
*NL*
teeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
universal
sign
of
winter
was
the
town
handyman
--
Miles
Bjornstam
,
a
*NL*
tall
,
thick
,
red-mustached
bachelor
,
opinionated
atheist
,
general-store
*NL*
arguer
,
cynical
Santa
Claus
.
Children
loved
him
,
and
he
sneaked
*NL*
away
from
work
to
tell
them
improbable
stories
of
sea-faring
and
*NL*
horse-trading
and
bears
.
The
children
's
parents
either
laughed
at
him
*NL*
or
hated
him
.
He
was
the
one
democrat
in
town
.
He
called
both
Lyman
Cass
*NL*
the
miller
and
the
Finn
homesteader
from
Lost
Lake
by
their
first
names
.
*NL*
He
was
known
as
``
The
Red
Swede
,
''
and
considered
slightly
insane
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bjornstam
could
do
anything
with
his
hands
--
solder
a
pan
,
weld
an

automobile

,
soothe
a
frightened
filly
,
tinker
a
clock
,
carve
a
*NL*
Gloucester
schooner
which
magically
went
into
a
bottle
.
Now
,
for
a
week
,
*NL*
he
was
commissioner
general
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
He
was
the
only
person
*NL*
besides
the
repairman
at
Sam
Clark
's
who
understood
plumbing
.
Everybody
*NL*
begged
him
to
look
over
the
furnace
and
the
water-pipes
.
He
rushed
*NL*
from
house
to
house
till
after
bedtime
--
ten
o'clock
.
Icicles
from
burst
*NL*
water-pipes
hung
along
the
skirt
of
his
brown
dog-skin
overcoat
;
his
*NL*
plush
cap
,
which
he
never
took
off
in
the
house
,
was
a
pulp
of
ice
and
*NL*
coal-dust
;
his
red
hands
were
cracked
to
rawness
;
he
chewed
the
stub
of
*NL*
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
courtly
to
Carol
.
He
stooped
to
examine
the
furnace
flues
;
he
*NL*
straightened
,
glanced
down
at
her
,
and
hemmed
,
``
Got
to
fix
your
furnace
,
*NL*
no
matter
what
else
I
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poorer
houses
of
Gopher
Prairie
,
where
the
services
of
Miles
*NL*
Bjornstam
were
a
luxury
--
which
included
the
shanty
of
Miles
*NL*
Bjornstam
--
were
banked
to
the
lower
windows
with
earth
and
manure
.
Along
*NL*
the
railroad
the
sections
of
snow
fence
,
which
had
been
stacked
all
*NL*
summer
in
romantic
wooden
tents
occupied
by
roving
small
boys
,
were
set
*NL*
up
to
prevent
drifts
from
covering
the
track
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
farmers
came
into
town
in
home-made
sleighs
,
with
bed-quilts
and
hay
*NL*
piled
in
the
rough
boxes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fur
coats
,
fur
caps
,
fur
mittens
,
overshoes
buckling
almost
to
the
*NL*
knees
,
gray
knitted
scarfs
ten
feet
long
,
thick
woolen
socks
,
canvas
*NL*
jackets
lined
with
fluffy
yellow
wool
like
the
plumage
of
ducklings
,
*NL*
moccasins
,
red
flannel
wristlets
for
the
blazing
chapped
wrists
*NL*
of
boys
--
these
protections
against
winter
were
busily
dug
out
of
*NL*
moth-ball-sprinkled
drawers
and
tar-bags
in
closets
,
and
all
over
town
*NL*
small
boys
were
squealing
,
``
Oh
,
there
's
my
mittens
!
''
or
``
Look
at
my
*NL*
shoe-packs
!
''
There
is
so
sharp
a
division
between
the
panting
summer
and
*NL*
the
stinging
winter
of
the
Northern
plains
that
they
rediscovered
with
*NL*
surprise
and
a
feeling
of
heroism
this
armor
of
an
Artic
explorer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Winter
garments
surpassed
even
personal
gossip
as
the
topic
at
parties
.
*NL*
It
was
good
form
to
ask
,
``
Put
on
your
heavies
yet
?
''
There
were
as
many
*NL*
distinctions
in
wraps
as
in
motor
cars
.
The
lesser
sort
appeared
in
*NL*
yellow
and
black
dogskin
coats
,
but
Kennicott
was
lordly
in
a
long
*NL*
raccoon
ulster
and
a
new
seal
cap
.
When
the
snow
was
too
deep
for
his
*NL*
motor
he
went
off
on
country
calls
in
a
shiny
,
floral
,
steel-tipped
*NL*
cutter
,
only
his
ruddy
nose
and
his
cigar
emerging
from
the
fur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
herself
stirred
Main
Street
by
a
loose
coat
of
nutria
.
Her
*NL*
finger-tips
loved
the
silken
fur
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
liveliest
activity
now
was
organizing
outdoor
sports
in
the
*NL*
motor-paralyzed
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
automobile
and
bridge-whist
had
not
only
made
more
evident
the
*NL*
social
divisions
in
Gopher
Prairie
but
they
had
also
enfeebled
the
*NL*
love
of
activity
.
It
was
so
rich-looking
to
sit
and
drive
--
and
so
easy
.
*NL*
Skiing
and
sliding
were
``
stupid
''
and
``
old-fashioned
.
''
In
fact
,
the
*NL*
village
longed
for
the
elegance
of
city
recreations
almost
as
much
as
*NL*
the
cities
longed
for
village
sports
;
and
Gopher
Prairie
took
as
*NL*
much
pride
in
neglecting
coasting
as
St.
Paul
--
or
New
York
--
in
going
*NL*
coasting
.
Carol
did
inspire
a
successful
skating-party
in
mid-November
.
*NL*
Plover
Lake
glistened
in
clear
sweeps
of
gray-green
ice
,
ringing
to
the
*NL*
skates
.
On
shore
the
ice-tipped
reeds
clattered
in
the
wind
,
and
oak
*NL*
twigs
with
stubborn
last
leaves
hung
against
a
milky
sky
.
Harry
Haydock
*NL*
did
figure-eights
,
and
Carol
was
certain
that
she
had
found
the
perfect
*NL*
life
.
But
when
snow
had
ended
the
skating
and
she
tried
to
get
up
a
*NL*
moonlight
sliding
party
,
the
matrons
hesitated
to
stir
away
from
their
*NL*
radiators
and
their
daily
bridge-whist
imitations
of
the
city
.
She
had
*NL*
to
nag
them
.
They
scooted
down
a
long
hill
on
a
bob-sled
,
they
upset
*NL*
and
got
snow
down
their
necks
they
shrieked
that
they
would
do
it
again
*NL*
immediately
--
and
they
did
not
do
it
again
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
badgered
another
group
into
going
skiing
.
They
shouted
and
threw
*NL*
snowballs
,
and
informed
her
that
it
was
SUCH
fun
,
and
they
'd
have
*NL*
another
skiing
expedition
right
away
,
and
they
jollily
returned
home
and
*NL*
never
thereafter
left
their
manuals
of
bridge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
discouraged
.
She
was
grateful
when
Kennicott
invited
her
to
*NL*
go
rabbit-hunting
in
the
woods
.
She
waded
down
stilly
cloisters
*NL*
between
burnt
stump
and
icy
oak
,
through
drifts
marked
with
a
million
*NL*
hieroglyphics
of
rabbit
and
mouse
and
bird
.
She
squealed
as
he
leaped
*NL*
on
a
pile
of
brush
and
fired
at
the
rabbit
which
ran
out
.
He
belonged
*NL*
there
,
masculine
in
reefer
and
sweater
and
high-laced
boots
.
That
night
*NL*
she
ate
prodigiously
of
steak
and
fried
potatoes
;
she
produced
electric
*NL*
sparks
by
touching
his
ear
with
her
finger-tip
;
she
slept
twelve
hours
;
*NL*
and
awoke
to
think
how
glorious
was
this
brave
land
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
to
a
radiance
of
sun
on
snow
.
Snug
in
her
furs
she
*NL*
trotted
up-town
.
Frosted
shingles
smoked
against
a
sky
colored
like
*NL*
flax-blossoms
,
sleigh-bells
clinked
,
shouts
of
greeting
were
loud
in
the
*NL*
thin
bright
air
,
and
everywhere
was
a
rhythmic
sound
of
wood-sawing
.
It
*NL*
was
Saturday
,
and
the
neighbors
'
sons
were
getting
up
the
winter
fuel
.
*NL*
Behind
walls
of
corded
wood
in
back
yards
their
sawbucks
stood
in
*NL*
depressions
scattered
with
canary-yellow
flakes
of
sawdust
.
The
frames
*NL*
of
their
buck-saws
were
cherry-red
,
the
blades
blued
steel
,
and
the
*NL*
fresh
cut
ends
of
the
sticks
--
poplar
,
maple
,
iron-wood
,
birch
--
were
*NL*
marked
with
engraved
rings
of
growth
.
The
boys
wore
shoe-packs
,
blue
*NL*
flannel
shirts
with
enormous
pearl
buttons
,
and
mackinaws
of
crimson
,
*NL*
lemon
yellow
,
and
foxy
brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
cried
``
Fine
day
!
''
to
the
boys
;
she
came
in
a
glow
to
Howland
&
*NL*
Gould
's
grocery
,
her
collar
white
with
frost
from
her
breath
;
she
bought
*NL*
a
can
of
tomatoes
as
though
it
were
Orient
fruit
;
and
returned
home
*NL*
planning
to
surprise
Kennicott
with
an
omelet
creole
for
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
brilliant
was
the
snow-glare
that
when
she
entered
the
house
she
*NL*
saw
the
door-knobs
,
the
newspaper
on
the
table
,
every
white
surface
as
*NL*
dazzling
mauve
,
and
her
head
was
dizzy
in
the
pyrotechnic
dimness
.
When
*NL*
her
eyes
had
recovered
she
felt
expanded
,
drunk
with
health
,
mistress
of
*NL*
life
.
The
world
was
so
luminous
that
she
sat
down
at
her
rickety
little
*NL*
desk
in
the
living-room
to
make
a
poem
.
-LRB-
She
got
no
farther
than
``
The
*NL*
sky
is
bright
,
the
sun
is
warm
,
there
ne'er
will
be
another
storm
.
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
mid-afternoon
of
this
same
day
Kennicott
was
called
into
the
*NL*
country
.
It
was
Bea
's
evening
out
--
her
evening
for
the
Lutheran
Dance
.
*NL*
Carol
was
alone
from
three
till
midnight
.
She
wearied
of
reading
pure
*NL*
love
stories
in
the
magazines
and
sat
by
a
radiator
,
beginning
to
brood
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
chanced
to
discover
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
,
she
meditated
,
passed
through
the
novelty
of
seeing
the
*NL*
town
and
meeting
people
,
of
skating
and
sliding
and
hunting
.
Bea
was
*NL*
competent
;
there
was
no
household
labor
except
sewing
and
darning
*NL*
and
gossipy
assistance
to
Bea
in
bed-making
.
She
could
n't
satisfy
her
*NL*
ingenuity
in
planning
meals
.
At
Dahl
&
Oleson
's
Meat
Market
you
did
n't
*NL*
give
orders
--
you
wofully
inquired
whether
there
was
anything
today
*NL*
besides
steak
and
pork
and
ham
.
The
cuts
of
beef
were
not
cuts
.
They
*NL*
were
hacks
.
Lamb
chops
were
as
exotic
as
sharks
'
fins
.
The
meat-dealers
*NL*
shipped
their
best
to
the
city
,
with
its
higher
prices
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
the
shops
there
was
the
same
lack
of
choice
.
She
could
not
find
*NL*
a
glass-headed
picture-nail
in
town
;
she
did
not
hunt
for
the
sort
of
*NL*
veiling
she
wanted
--
she
took
what
she
could
get
;
and
only
at
Howland
&
*NL*
Gould
's
was
there
such
a
luxury
as
canned
asparagus
.
Routine
care
was
*NL*
all
she
could
devote
to
the
house
.
Only
by
such
fussing
as
the
Widow
*NL*
Bogart
's
could
she
make
it
fill
her
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
have
outside
employment
.
To
the
village
doctor
's
wife
it
*NL*
was
taboo
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
woman
with
a
working
brain
and
no
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
only
three
things
which
she
could
do
:
Have
children
;
start
*NL*
her
career
of
reforming
;
or
become
so
definitely
a
part
of
the
town
that
*NL*
she
would
be
fulfilled
by
the
activities
of
church
and
study-club
and
*NL*
bridge-parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Children
,
yes
,
she
wanted
them
,
but
--
She
was
not
quite
ready
.
She
had
*NL*
been
embarrassed
by
Kennicott
's
frankness
,
but
she
agreed
with
him
*NL*
that
in
the
insane
condition
of
civilization
,
which
made
the
rearing
*NL*
of
citizens
more
costly
and
perilous
than
any
other
crime
,
it
was
*NL*
inadvisable
to
have
children
till
he
had
made
more
money
.
She
was
*NL*
sorry
--
Perhaps
he
had
made
all
the
mystery
of
love
a
mechanical
*NL*
cautiousness
but
--
She
fled
from
the
thought
with
a
dubious
,
``
Some
*NL*
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
``
reforms
,
''
her
impulses
toward
beauty
in
raw
Main
Street
,
they
had
*NL*
become
indistinct
.
But
she
would
set
them
going
now
.
She
would
!
She
*NL*
swore
it
with
soft
fist
beating
the
edges
of
the
radiator
.
And
at
the
*NL*
end
of
all
her
vows
she
had
no
notion
as
to
when
and
where
the
crusade
*NL*
was
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
Become
an
authentic
part
of
the
town
?
She
began
to
think
with
unpleasant
*NL*
lucidity
.
She
reflected
that
she
did
not
know
whether
the
people
liked
*NL*
her
.
She
had
gone
to
the
women
at
afternoon-coffees
,
to
the
merchants
*NL*
in
their
stores
,
with
so
many
outpouring
comments
and
whimsies
that
*NL*
she
had
n't
given
them
a
chance
to
betray
their
opinions
of
her
.
The
men
*NL*
smiled
--
but
did
they
like
her
?
She
was
lively
among
the
women
--
but
*NL*
was
she
one
of
them
?
She
could
not
recall
many
times
when
she
had
been
*NL*
admitted
to
the
whispering
of
scandal
which
is
the
secret
chamber
of
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
conversation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
poisoned
with
doubt
,
as
she
drooped
up
to
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
day
,
through
her
shopping
,
her
mind
sat
back
and
observed
.
Dave
*NL*
Dyer
and
Sam
Clark
were
as
cordial
as
she
had
been
fancying
;
but
was
n't
*NL*
there
an
impersonal
abruptness
in
the
``
H
'
are
yuh
?
''
of
Chet
Dashaway
?
*NL*
Howland
the
grocer
was
curt
.
Was
that
merely
his
usual
manner
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
infuriating
to
have
to
pay
attention
to
what
people
think
.
In
*NL*
St.
Paul
I
did
n't
care
.
But
here
I
'm
spied
on
.
They
're
watching
*NL*
me
.
I
must
n't
let
it
make
me
self-conscious
,
''
she
coaxed
*NL*
herself
--
overstimulated
by
the
drug
of
thought
,
and
offensively
on
the
*NL*
defensive
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
thaw
which
stripped
the
snow
from
the
sidewalks
;
a
ringing
iron
night
*NL*
when
the
lakes
could
be
heard
booming
;
a
clear
roistering
morning
.
In
*NL*
tam
o'shanter
and
tweed
skirt
Carol
felt
herself
a
college
junior
going
*NL*
out
to
play
hockey
.
She
wanted
to
whoop
,
her
legs
ached
to
run
.
On
the
*NL*
way
home
from
shopping
she
yielded
,
as
a
pup
would
have
yielded
.
She
*NL*
galloped
down
a
block
and
as
she
jumped
from
a
curb
across
a
welter
of
*NL*
slush
,
she
gave
a
student
``
Yippee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
in
a
window
three
old
women
were
gasping
.
Their
triple
*NL*
glare
was
paralyzing
.
Across
the
street
,
at
another
window
,
the
curtain
*NL*
had
secretively
moved
.
She
stopped
,
walked
on
sedately
,
changed
from
the
*NL*
girl
Carol
into
Mrs.
Dr.
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
again
felt
quite
young
enough
and
defiant
enough
and
free
*NL*
enough
to
run
and
halloo
in
the
public
streets
;
and
it
was
as
a
Nice
*NL*
Married
Woman
that
she
attended
the
next
weekly
bridge
of
the
Jolly
*NL*
Seventeen
.

*NL*
The
Jolly
Seventeen
-LRB-
the
membership
of
which
ranged
from
fourteen
to
*NL*
twenty-six
-RRB-
was
the
social
cornice
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
It
was
the
country
*NL*
club
,
the
diplomatic
set
,
the
St.
Cecilia
,
the
Ritz
oval
room
,
the
Club
*NL*
de
Vingt
.
To
belong
to
it
was
to
be
``
in
.
''
Though
its
membership
partly
*NL*
coincided
with
that
of
the
Thanatopsis
study
club
,
the
Jolly
Seventeen
*NL*
as
a
separate
entity
guffawed
at
the
Thanatopsis
,
and
considered
it
*NL*
middle-class
and
even
``
highbrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
were
young
married
women
,
with
their
*NL*
husbands
as
associate
members
.
Once
a
week
they
had
a
women
's
*NL*
afternoon-bridge
;
once
a
month
the
husbands
joined
them
for
supper
and
*NL*
evening-bridge
;
twice
a
year
they
had
dances
at
I.
O.
O.
F.
Hall
.
Then
*NL*
the
town
exploded
.
Only
at
the
annual
balls
of
the
Firemen
and
of
the
*NL*
Eastern
Star
was
there
such
prodigality
of
chiffon
scarfs
and
tangoing
*NL*
and
heart-burnings
,
and
these
rival
institutions
were
not
select
--
hired
*NL*
girls
attended
the
Firemen
's
Ball
,
with
section-hands
and
laborers
.
Ella
*NL*
Stowbody
had
once
gone
to
a
Jolly
Seventeen
Soiree
in
the
village
hack
,
*NL*
hitherto
confined
to
chief
mourners
at
funerals
;
and
Harry
Haydock
and
*NL*
Dr.
Terry
Gould
always
appeared
in
the
town
's
only
specimens
of
evening
*NL*
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon-bridge
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
which
followed
Carol
's
*NL*
lonely
doubting
was
held
at
Juanita
Haydock
's
new
concrete
bungalow
,
*NL*
with
its
door
of
polished
oak
and
beveled
plate-glass
,
jar
of
ferns
in
*NL*
the
plastered
hall
,
and
in
the
living-room
,
a
fumed
oak
Morris
chair
,
*NL*
sixteen
color-prints
,
and
a
square
varnished
table
with
a
mat
made
of
*NL*
cigar-ribbons
on
which
was
one
Illustrated
Gift
Edition
and
one
pack
of
*NL*
cards
in
a
burnt-leather
case
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
stepped
into
a
sirocco
of
furnace
heat
.
They
were
already
playing
.
*NL*
Despite
her
flabby
resolves
she
had
not
yet
learned
bridge
.
She
was
*NL*
winningly
apologetic
about
it
to
Juanita
,
and
ashamed
that
she
should
*NL*
have
to
go
on
being
apologetic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
,
a
sallow
woman
with
a
thin
prettiness
devoted
to
*NL*
experiments
in
religious
cults
,
illnesses
,
and
scandal-bearing
,
shook
*NL*
her
finger
at
Carol
and
trilled
,
``
You
're
a
naughty
one
!
I
do
n't
believe
*NL*
you
appreciate
the
honor
,
when
you
got
into
the
Jolly
Seventeen
so
*NL*
easy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Chet
Dashaway
nudged
her
neighbor
at
the
second
table
.
But
Carol
*NL*
kept
up
the
appealing
bridal
manner
so
far
as
possible
.
She
twittered
,
*NL*
``
You
're
perfectly
right
.
I
'm
a
lazy
thing
.
I
'll
make
Will
start
teaching
*NL*
me
this
very
evening
.
''
Her
supplication
had
all
the
sound
of
birdies
*NL*
in
the
nest
,
and
Easter
church-bells
,
and
frosted
Christmas
cards
.
*NL*
Internally
she
snarled
,
``
That
ought
to
be
saccharine
enough
.
''
She
sat
in
*NL*
the
smallest
rocking-chair
,
a
model
of
Victorian
modesty
.
But
she
saw
or
*NL*
she
imagined
that
the
women
who
had
gurgled
at
her
so
welcomingly
when
*NL*
she
had
first
come
to
Gopher
Prairie
were
nodding
at
her
brusquely
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
pause
after
the
first
game
she
petitioned
Mrs.
Jackson
Elder
,
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
get
up
another
bob-sled
party
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
cold
when
you
get
dumped
in
the
snow
,
''
said
Mrs.
Elder
,
*NL*
indifferently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hate
snow
down
my
neck
,
''
volunteered
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
,
with
an
*NL*
unpleasant
look
at
Carol
and
,
turning
her
back
,
she
bubbled
at
Rita
*NL*
Simons
,
``
Dearie
,
wo
n't
you
run
in
this
evening
?
I
've
got
the
loveliest
*NL*
new
Butterick
pattern
I
want
to
show
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
crept
back
to
her
chair
.
In
the
fervor
of
discussing
the
game
they
*NL*
ignored
her
.
She
was
not
used
to
being
a
wallflower
.
She
struggled
to
*NL*
keep
from
oversensitiveness
,
from
becoming
unpopular
by
the
sure
method
*NL*
of
believing
that
she
was
unpopular
;
but
she
had
n't
much
reserve
of
*NL*
patience
,
and
at
the
end
of
the
second
game
,
when
Ella
Stowbody
sniffily
*NL*
asked
her
,
``
Are
you
going
to
send
to
Minneapolis
for
your
dress
for
*NL*
the
next
soiree
--
heard
you
were
,
''
Carol
said
``
Do
n't
know
yet
''
with
*NL*
unnecessary
sharpness
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
relieved
by
the
admiration
with
which
the
jeune
fille
Rita
*NL*
Simons
looked
at
the
steel
buckles
on
her
pumps
;
but
she
resented
Mrs.
*NL*
Howland
's
tart
demand
,
``
Do
n't
you
find
that
new
couch
of
yours
is
too
*NL*
broad
to
be
practical
?
''
She
nodded
,
then
shook
her
head
,
and
touchily
*NL*
left
Mrs.
Howland
to
get
out
of
it
any
meaning
she
desired
.
Immediately
*NL*
she
wanted
to
make
peace
.
She
was
close
to
simpering
in
the
sweetness
*NL*
with
which
she
addressed
Mrs
Howland
:
``
I
think
that
is
the
prettiest
*NL*
display
of
beef-tea
your
husband
has
in
his
store
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
Gopher
Prairie
is
n't
so
much
behind
the
times
,
''
gibed
Mrs.
*NL*
Howland
.
Some
one
giggled
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
rebuffs
made
her
haughty
;
her
haughtiness
irritated
them
to
*NL*
franker
rebuffs
;
they
were
working
up
to
a
state
of
painfully
righteous
*NL*
war
when
they
were
saved
by
the
coming
of
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Juanita
Haydock
was
highly
advanced
in
the
matters
of
*NL*
finger-bowls
,
doilies
,
and
bath-mats
,
her
``
refreshments
''
were
typical
*NL*
of
all
the
afternoon-coffees
.
Juanita
's
best
friends
,
Mrs.
Dyer
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Dashaway
,
passed
large
dinner
plates
,
each
with
a
spoon
,
a
fork
,
and
a
*NL*
coffee
cup
without
saucer
.
They
apologized
and
discussed
the
afternoon
's
*NL*
game
as
they
passed
through
the
thicket
of
women
's
feet
.
Then
they
*NL*
distributed
hot
buttered
rolls
,
coffee
poured
from
an
enamel-ware
pot
,
*NL*
stuffed
olives
,
potato
salad
,
and
angel
's
-
food
cake
.
There
was
,
even
in
*NL*
the
most
strictly
conforming
Gopher
Prairie
circles
,
a
certain
option
*NL*
as
to
collations
.
The
olives
need
not
be
stuffed
.
Doughnuts
were
in
some
*NL*
houses
well
thought
of
as
a
substitute
for
the
hot
buttered
rolls
.
*NL*
But
there
was
in
all
the
town
no
heretic
save
Carol
who
omitted
*NL*
angel
's
-
food
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
ate
enormously
.
Carol
had
a
suspicion
that
the
thriftier
housewives
*NL*
made
the
afternoon
treat
do
for
evening
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
get
back
into
the
current
.
She
edged
over
to
Mrs.
McGanum
.
*NL*
Chunky
,
amiable
,
young
Mrs.
McGanum
with
her
breast
and
arms
of
a
*NL*
milkmaid
,
and
her
loud
delayed
laugh
which
burst
startlingly
from
*NL*
a
sober
face
,
was
the
daughter
of
old
Dr.
Westlake
,
and
the
wife
of
*NL*
Westlake
's
partner
,
Dr.
McGanum
.
Kennicott
asserted
that
Westlake
and
*NL*
McGanum
and
their
contaminated
families
were
tricky
,
but
Carol
had
found
*NL*
them
gracious
.
She
asked
for
friendliness
by
crying
to
Mrs.
McGanum
,
*NL*
``
How
is
the
baby
's
throat
now
?
''
and
she
was
attentive
while
Mrs.
McGanum
*NL*
rocked
and
knitted
and
placidly
described
symptoms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
Sherwin
came
in
after
school
,
with
Miss
Ethel
Villets
,
the
*NL*
town
librarian
.
Miss
Sherwin
's
optimistic
presence
gave
Carol
more
*NL*
confidence
.
She
talked
.
She
informed
the
circle
``
I
drove
almost
down
to
*NL*
Wahkeenyan
with
Will
,
a
few
days
ago
.
Is
n't
the
country
lovely
!
And
I
do
*NL*
admire
the
Scandinavian
farmers
down
there
so
:
their
big
red
barns
and
*NL*
silos
and
milking-machines
and
everything
.
Do
you
all
know
that
lonely
*NL*
Lutheran
church
,
with
the
tin-covered
spire
,
that
stands
out
alone
on
*NL*
a
hill
?
It
's
so
bleak
;
somehow
it
seems
so
brave
.
I
do
think
the
*NL*
Scandinavians
are
the
hardiest
and
best
people
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
THINK
so
?
''
protested
Mrs.
Jackson
Elder
.
``
My
husband
says
*NL*
the
Svenskas
that
work
in
the
planing-mill
are
perfectly
terrible
--
so
*NL*
silent
and
cranky
,
and
so
selfish
,
the
way
they
keep
demanding
raises
.
*NL*
If
they
had
their
way
they
'd
simply
ruin
the
business

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
they
're
simply
GHASTLY
hired
girls

wailed
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
.
*NL*
``
I
swear
,
I
work
myself
to
skin
and
bone
trying
to
please
my
hired
*NL*
girls
--
when
I
can
get
them
!
I
do
everything
in
the
world
for
them
.
They
*NL*
can
have
their
gentleman
friends
call
on
them
in
the
kitchen
any
time
,
*NL*
and
they
get
just
the
same
to
eat
as
we
do
,
if
there
's
,
any
left
over
,
*NL*
and
I
practically
never
jump
on
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
rattled
,
``
They
're
ungrateful
,
all
that
class
of
people
.
*NL*
I
do
think
the
domestic
problem
is
simply
becoming
awful
.
I
do
n't
know
*NL*
what
the
country
's
coming
to
,
with
these
Scandahoofian
clodhoppers
*NL*
demanding
every
cent
you
can
save
,
and
so
ignorant
and
impertinent
,
*NL*
and
on
my
word
,
demanding
bath-tubs
and
everything
--
as
if
they
were
n't
*NL*
mighty
good
and
lucky
at
home
if
they
got
a
bath
in
the
wash-tub
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
off
,
riding
hard
.
Carol
thought
of
Bea
and
waylaid
them
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
n't
it
possibly
the
fault
of
the
mistresses
if
the
maids
are
*NL*
ungrateful
?
For
generations
we
've
given
them
the
leavings
of
food
,
and
*NL*
holes
to
live
in
.
I
do
n't
want
to
boast
,
but
I
must
say
I
do
n't
have
*NL*
much
trouble
with
Bea
.
She
's
so
friendly

The
Scandinavians
are
sturdy

and
honest

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
snapped
,
``
Honest

Do
you
call
it
honest

hold
us
up

n't
say
that

Carol
ventured

Mrs.

stated
in

shocked

reinforced
by

universal
glower

Carol
was
angry

broke
into

a
furious
,

Their
eyes
were
hostile

Four
of

were
talking
at

Vida

Sherwin

dictatorial
voice
cut
through

took
control
of
the

Carol
Kennicott

you

right

quit
looking
so
belligerent

party

They
all
laughed
artificially

obediently
``
talked

the

a
provincial
teacher

a
colloquial

over

echoed

cellar-plots

will
agree

one
thing

The
chief
task
of

is
to
get
people
to
read

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
feel
so

My
feeling

Mrs.

I
am
merely
quoting
*NL*
the
librarian

a
very
large
college

is
that
the
first
duty
of

*NL*
CONSCIENTIOUS

is
to
preserve
the
books

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
Carol
repented
her
``
Oh

Miss
Villets
stiffened
,
and
attacked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
be
all
very
well

ruin
books

just
deliberately
tear
them
up

*NL*
fresh
young
men
take
more
books
out
than
they
are
entitled
to
by
the
*NL*
regulations

I
'm
never
going

permit
it
in

*NL*
*NL*
``
What
if
some

are
destructive

They
learn

*NL*
``
Nothing
is
cheaper

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
saw
that
the
others
were
listening

waiting
for
her
to
be
*NL*
objectionable

She
flinched
before
their
dislike

She
hastened
to
smile

in
agreement
with
Miss

to
glance
publicly

*NL*
She
ignored
Bea
's
call
from
the
kitchen
;
she
ran
up-stairs
to
the
*NL*
unfrequented
guest-room

she
wept
in
terror

her

she
knelt

she
said

with
such
excess

bright

Carol
was
uneasy

Vida
took
off

with

bounce

she
sat
down
as

were

she
flung
out

the

He
said

it
with
a
flourish

Carol
perceived
that

believed
it

turned

her
breath

into

CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
had
tripped
into
the
meadow
to
teach
the
lambs
a
pretty
educational
*NL*
dance
and
found
that
the
lambs
were
wolves
.
There
was
no
way
out
between
*NL*
their
pressing
gray
shoulders
.
She
was
surrounded
by
fangs
and
sneering
*NL*
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
go
on
enduring
the
hidden
derision
.
She
wanted
to
flee
.
*NL*
She
wanted
to
hide
in
the
generous
indifference
of
cities
.
She
practised
*NL*
saying
to
Kennicott
,
``
Think
perhaps
I
'll
run
down
to
St.
Paul
for
a
few
*NL*
days
.
''
But
she
could
not
trust
herself
to
say
it
carelessly
;
could
not
*NL*
abide
his
certain
questioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reform
the
town
?
All
she
wanted
was
to
be
tolerated
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
look
directly
at
people
.
She
flushed
and
winced
before
*NL*
citizens
who
a
week
ago
had
been
amusing
objects
of
study
,
and
in
their
*NL*
good-mornings
she
heard
a
cruel
sniggering
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
encountered
Juanita
Haydock
at
Ole
Jenson
's
grocery
.
She
besought
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
how
do
you
do
!
Heavens
,
what
beautiful
celery
that
is
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
does
n't
it
look
fresh
.
Harry
simply
has
to
have
his
celery
on
*NL*
Sunday
,
drat
the
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
hastened
out
of
the
shop
exulting
,
``
She
did
n't
make
fun
of
me
...
*NL*
Did
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
week
she
had
recovered
from
consciousness
of
insecurity
,
of
shame
*NL*
and
whispering
notoriety
,
but
she
kept
her
habit
of
avoiding
people
.
She
*NL*
walked
the
streets
with
her
head
down
.
When
she
spied
Mrs.
McGanum
or
*NL*
Mrs.
Dyer
ahead
she
crossed
over
with
an
elaborate
pretense
of
looking
*NL*
at
a
billboard
.
Always
she
was
acting
,
for
the
benefit
of
every
one
she
*NL*
saw
--
and
for
the
benefit
of
the
ambushed
leering
eyes
which
she
did
not
*NL*
see
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
perceived
that
Vida
Sherwin
had
told
the
truth
.
Whether
she
entered
*NL*
a
store
,
or
swept
the
back
porch
,
or
stood
at
the
bay-window
in
the
*NL*
living-room
,
the
village
peeped
at
her
.
Once
she
had
swung
along
the
*NL*
street
triumphant
in
making
a
home
.
Now
she
glanced
at
each
house
,
and
*NL*
felt
,
when
she
was
safely
home
,
that
she
had
won
past
a
thousand
*NL*
enemies
armed
with
ridicule
.
She
told
herself
that
her
sensitiveness
*NL*
was
preposterous
,
but
daily
she
was
thrown
into
panic
.
She
saw
curtains
*NL*
slide
back
into
innocent
smoothness
.
Old
women
who
had
been
entering
*NL*
their
houses
slipped
out
again
to
stare
at
her
--
in
the
wintry
quiet
she
*NL*
could
hear
them
tiptoeing
on
their
porches
.
When
she
had
for
a
blessed
*NL*
hour
forgotten
the
searchlight
,
when
she
was
scampering
through
a
chill
*NL*
dusk
,
happy
in
yellow
windows
against
gray
night
,
her
heart
checked
*NL*
as
she
realized
that
a
head
covered
with
a
shawl
was
thrust
up
over
a
*NL*
snow-tipped
bush
to
watch
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
admitted
that
she
was
taking
herself
too
seriously
;
that
villagers
*NL*
gape
at
every
one
.
She
became
placid
,
and
thought
well
of
her
*NL*
philosophy
.
But
next
morning
she
had
a
shock
of
shame
as
she
entered
*NL*
Ludelmeyer
's
.
The
grocer
,
his
clerk
,
and
neurotic
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
had
been
*NL*
giggling
about
something
.
They
halted
,
looked
embarrassed
,
babbled
about
*NL*
onions
.
Carol
felt
guilty
.
That
evening
when
Kennicott
took
her
to
call
*NL*
on
the
crochety
Lyman
Casses
,
their
hosts
seemed
flustered
at
their
*NL*
arrival
.
Kennicott
jovially
hooted
,
``
What
makes
you
so
hang-dog
,
Lym
?
''
*NL*
The
Casses
tittered
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
Dave
Dyer
,
Sam
Clark
,
and
Raymie
Wutherspoon
,
there
were
no
*NL*
merchants
of
whose
welcome
Carol
was
certain
.
She
knew
that
she
read
*NL*
mockery
into
greetings
but
she
could
not
control
her
suspicion
,
could
*NL*
not
rise
from
her
psychic
collapse
.
She
alternately
raged
and
flinched
*NL*
at
the
superiority
of
the
merchants
.
They
did
not
know
that
they
*NL*
were
being
rude
,
but
they
meant
to
have
it
understood
that
they
were
*NL*
prosperous
and
``
not
scared
of
no
doctor
's
wife
.
''
They
often
said
,
``
One
*NL*
man
's
as
good
as
another
--
and
a
darn
sight
better
.
''
This
motto
,
however
,
*NL*
they
did
not
commend
to
farmer
customers
who
had
had
crop
failures
.
The
*NL*
Yankee
merchants
were
crabbed
;
and
Ole
Jenson
,
Ludelmeyer
,
and
Gus
Dahl
,
*NL*
from
the
``
Old
Country
,
''
wished
to
be
taken
for
Yankees
.
James
Madison
*NL*
Howland
,
born
in
New
Hampshire
,
and
Ole
Jenson
,
born
in
Sweden
,
both
*NL*
proved
that
they
were
free
American
citizens
by
grunting
,
``
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
whether
I
got
any
or
not
,
''
or
``
Well
,
you
ca
n't
expect
me
to
get
it
*NL*
delivered
by
noon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
good
form
for
the
customers
to
fight
back
.
Juanita
Haydock
*NL*
cheerfully
jabbered
,
``
You
have
it
there
by
twelve
or
I
'll
snatch
that
*NL*
fresh
delivery-boy
bald-headed
.
''
But
Carol
had
never
been
able
to
play
*NL*
the
game
of
friendly
rudeness
;
and
now
she
was
certain
that
she
never
*NL*
would
learn
it
.
She
formed
the
cowardly
habit
of
going
to
Axel
Egge
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
Axel
was
not
respectable
and
rude
.
He
was
still
a
foreigner
,
and
he
*NL*
expected
to
remain
one
.
His
manner
was
heavy
and
uninterrogative
.
His
*NL*
establishment
was
more
fantastic
than
any
cross-roads
store
.
No
one
save
*NL*
Axel
himself
could
find
anything
.
A
part
of
the
assortment
of
children
's
*NL*
stockings
was
under
a
blanket
on
a
shelf
,
a
part
in
a
tin
ginger-snap
*NL*
box
,
the
rest
heaped
like
a
nest
of
black-cotton
snakes
upon
a
*NL*
flour-barrel
which
was
surrounded
by
brooms
,
Norwegian
Bibles
,
dried
*NL*
cod
for
ludfisk
,
boxes
of
apricots
,
and
a
pair
and
a
half
of
lumbermen
's
*NL*
rubber-footed
boots
.
The
place
was
crowded
with
Scandinavian
farmwives
,
*NL*
standing
aloof
in
shawls
and
ancient
fawn-colored
leg
o
'
mutton
jackets
,
*NL*
awaiting
the
return
of
their
lords
.
They
spoke
Norwegian
or
Swedish
,
and
*NL*
looked
at
Carol
uncomprehendingly
.
They
were
a
relief
to
her
--
they
were
*NL*
not
whispering
that
she
was
a
poseur
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
what
she
told
herself
was
that
Axel
Egge
's
was
``
so
picturesque
and
*NL*
romantic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
the
matter
of
clothes
that
she
was
most
self-conscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
dared
to
go
shopping
in
her
new
checked
suit
with
the
*NL*
black-embroidered
sulphur
collar
,
she
had
as
good
as
invited
all
of
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
-LRB-
which
interested
itself
in
nothing
so
intimately
as
in
*NL*
new
clothes
and
the
cost
thereof
-RRB-
to
investigate
her
.
It
was
a
smart
*NL*
suit
with
lines
unfamiliar
to
the
dragging
yellow
and
pink
frocks
of
the
*NL*
town
.
The
Widow
Bogart
's
stare
,
from
her
porch
,
indicated
,
``
Well
I
*NL*
never
saw
anything
like
that
before
!
''
Mrs.
McGanum
stopped
Carol
at
*NL*
the
notions
shop
to
hint
,
``
My
,
that
's
a
nice
suit
--
was
n't
it
terribly
*NL*
expensive
?
''
The
gang
of
boys
in
front
of
the
drug
store
commented
,
``
Hey
,
*NL*
Pudgie
,
play
you
a
game
of
checkers
on
that
dress
.
''
Carol
could
not
*NL*
endure
it
.
She
drew
her
fur
coat
over
the
suit
and
hastily
fastened
the
*NL*
buttons
,
while
the
boys
snickered
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
group
angered
her
quite
so
much
as
these
staring
young
roues
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
tried
to
convince
herself
that
the
village
,
with
its
fresh
air
,
*NL*
its
lakes
for
fishing
and
swimming
,
was
healthier
than
the
artificial
*NL*
city
.
But
she
was
sickened
by
glimpses
of
the
gang
of
boys
from
fourteen
*NL*
to
twenty
who
loafed
before
Dyer
's
Drug
Store
,
smoking
cigarettes
,
*NL*
displaying
``
fancy
''
shoes
and
purple
ties
and
coats
of
diamond-shaped
*NL*
buttons
,
whistling
the
Hoochi-Koochi
and
catcalling
,
``
Oh
,
you
baby-doll
''
*NL*
at
every
passing
girl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
them
playing
pool
in
the
stinking
room
behind
Del
Snafflin
's
*NL*
barber
shop
,
and
shaking
dice
in
``
The
Smoke
House
,
''
and
gathered
in
*NL*
a
snickering
knot
to
listen
to
the
``
juicy
stories
''
of
Bert
Tybee
,
the
*NL*
bartender
of
the
Minniemashie
House
.
She
heard
them
smacking
moist
lips
*NL*
over
every
love-scene
at
the
Rosebud
Movie
Palace
.
At
the
counter
of
the
*NL*
Greek
Confectionery
Parlor
,
while
they
ate
dreadful
messes
of
decayed
*NL*
bananas
,
acid
cherries
,
whipped
cream
,
and
gelatinous
ice-cream
,
they
*NL*
screamed
to
one
another
,
``
Hey
,
lem
me
`
lone
,
''
``
Quit
dog-gone
you
,
looka
*NL*
what
you
went
and
done
,
you
almost
spilled
my
glass
swater
,
''
``
Like
hell
*NL*
I
did
,
''
``
Hey
,
gol
darn
your
hide
,
do
n't
you
go
sticking
your
coffin
*NL*
nail
in
my

,
''
``
Oh
you
Batty
,
how
juh
like
dancing
with
Tillie
*NL*
McGuire
,
last
night
?
Some
squeezing
,
heh
,
kid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
diligent
consultation
of
American
fiction
she
discovered
that
this
*NL*
was
the
only
virile
and
amusing
manner
in
which
boys
could
function
;
*NL*
that
boys
who
were
not
compounded
of
the
gutter
and
the
mining-camp
*NL*
were
mollycoddles
and
unhappy
.
She
had
taken
this
for
granted
.
She
had
*NL*
studied
the
boys
pityingly
,
but
impersonally
.
It
had
not
occurred
to
her
*NL*
that
they
might
touch
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
was
aware
that
they
knew
all
about
her
;
that
they
were
waiting
*NL*
for
some
affectation
over
which
they
could
guffaw
.
No
schoolgirl
passed
*NL*
their
observation-posts
more
flushingly
than
did
Mrs.
Dr.
Kennicott
.
In
*NL*
shame
she
knew
that
they
glanced
appraisingly
at
her
snowy
overshoes
,
*NL*
speculating
about
her
legs
.
Theirs
were
not
young
eyes
--
there
was
no
*NL*
youth
in
all
the
town
,
she
agonized
.
They
were
born
old
,
grim
and
old
*NL*
and
spying
and
censorious
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
again
that
their
youth
was
senile
and
cruel
on
the
day
when
*NL*
she
overheard
Cy
Bogart
and
Earl
Haydock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cyrus
N.
Bogart
,
son
of
the
righteous
widow
who
lived
across
the
alley
,
*NL*
was
at
this
time
a
boy
of
fourteen
or
fifteen
.
Carol
had
already
seen
*NL*
quite
enough
of
Cy
Bogart
.
On
her
first
evening
in
Gopher
Prairie
Cy
*NL*
had
appeared
at
the
head
of
a
``
charivari
,
''
banging
immensely
upon
a
*NL*
discarded
automobile
fender
.
His
companions
were
yelping
in
imitation
*NL*
of
coyotes
.
Kennicott
had
felt
rather
complimented
;
had
gone
out
and
*NL*
distributed
a
dollar
.
But
Cy
was
a
capitalist
in
charivaris
.
He
returned
*NL*
with
an
entirely
new
group
,
and
this
time
there
were
three
automobile
*NL*
fenders
and
a
carnival
rattle
.
When
Kennicott
again
interrupted
his
*NL*
shaving
,
Cy
piped
,
``
Naw
,
you
got
to
give
us
two
dollars
,
''
and
he
got
it
.
*NL*
A
week
later
Cy
rigged
a
tic-tac
to
a
window
of
the
living-room
,
and
the
*NL*
tattoo
out
of
the
darkness
frightened
Carol
into
screaming
.
Since
*NL*
then
,
in
four
months
,
she
had
beheld
Cy
hanging
a
cat
,
stealing
melons
,
*NL*
throwing
tomatoes
at
the
Kennicott
house
,
and
making
ski-tracks
across
*NL*
the
lawn
,
and
had
heard
him
explaining
the
mysteries
of
generation
,
*NL*
with
great
audibility
and
dismaying
knowledge
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
a
museum
*NL*
specimen
of
what
a
small
town
,
a
well-disciplined
public
school
,
a
*NL*
tradition
of
hearty
humor
,
and
a
pious
mother
could
produce
from
the
*NL*
material
of
a
courageous
and
ingenious
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
afraid
of
him
.
Far
from
protesting
when
he
set
his
mongrel
on
*NL*
a
kitten
,
she
worked
hard
at
not
seeing
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Kennicott
garage
was
a
shed
littered
with
paint-cans
,
tools
,
a
*NL*
lawn-mower
,
and
ancient
wisps
of
hay
.
Above
it
was
a
loft
which
Cy
*NL*
Bogart
and
Earl
Haydock
,
young
brother
of
Harry
,
used
as
a
den
,
for
*NL*
smoking
,
hiding
from
whippings
,
and
planning
secret
societies
.
They
*NL*
climbed
to
it
by
a
ladder
on
the
alley
side
of
the
shed
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
morning
of
late
January
,
two
or
three
weeks
after
Vida
's
*NL*
revelations
,
Carol
had
gone
into
the
stable-garage
to
find
a
hammer
.
*NL*
Snow
softened
her
step
.
She
heard
voices
in
the
loft
above
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
gee
,
lez
--
oh
,
lez
go
down
the
lake
and
swipe
some
mushrats
out

Cy
was
yawning
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
get
our
ears
beat
off

grumbled
Earl
Haydock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
A

a
thumping
of
loose
boards

silence

weary

from
Cy
:

she

down

notice

*NL*
Then
Carol
fled

*NL*
*NL*
In
her
innocence
she
had
not
known
that
the
whole
town
could
discuss
*NL*
even
her
garments
,
her
body
.
She
felt
that
she
was
being
dragged
naked
*NL*
down
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
it
was
dusk
she
pulled
down
the
window-shades
,
all
the
shades
*NL*
flush
with
the
sill

beyond
them
she
felt
moist
fleering
eyes

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
,
and
tried
to
forget
,
and
remembered
more
sharply
the
*NL*
vulgar
detail
of
her
husband
's
having
observed
the
ancient
customs
*NL*
of
the
land
by
chewing
tobacco
.
She
would
have
preferred
a
prettier
*NL*
vice
--
gambling
or
a
mistress
.
For
these
she
might
have
found
a
luxury
*NL*
of
forgiveness
.
She
could
not
remember
any
fascinatingly
wicked
hero
of
*NL*
fiction
who
chewed
tobacco
.
She
asserted
that
it
proved
him
to
be
a
man
*NL*
of
the
bold
free
West
.
She
tried
to
align
him
with
the
hairy-chested
*NL*
heroes
of
the
motion-pictures
.
She
curled
on
the
couch
a
pallid
softness
*NL*
in
the
twilight
,
and
fought
herself
,
and
lost
the
battle
.
Spitting
did
*NL*
not
identify
him
with
rangers
riding
the
buttes
;
it
merely
bound
him
to
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
--
to
Nat
Hicks
the
tailor
and
Bert
Tybee
the
bartender
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But

Oh

what

We
're
all

some
things

I
think
of
myself
as
so
superior
,
but
I
do
eat
and
digest
,
*NL*
I
do
wash
my
dirty
paws
and
scratch

a

stands
by
me

believing
that

He
's
the
Rock
of
Ages

in
a
storm
of

meanness
that
's
driving
me
mad

it
will
drive
me
mad

''
*NL*
*NL*
All
evening
she
sang
Scotch
ballads
to
Kennicott
,
and
when
she
noticed
*NL*
that
he
was
chewing
an
unlighted
cigar
she
smiled
maternally
at
his
*NL*
secret
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
escape
asking
-LRB-
in
the
exact
words
and
mental
intonations
*NL*
which
a
thousand
million
women
,
dairy
wenches
and
mischief-making
*NL*
queens
,
had
used
before
her
,
and
which
a
million
million
women
will
*NL*
know
hereafter
-RRB-
,
``
Was
it
all
a
horrible
mistake
,
my
marrying
him

She
*NL*
quieted
the
doubt
--
without
answering
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
taken
her
north
to
Lac-qui-Meurt
,
in
the
Big
Woods
.
It
was
*NL*
the
entrance
to
a
Chippewa
Indian
reservation
,
a
sandy
settlement
among
*NL*
Norway
pines
on
the
shore
of
a
huge
snow-glaring
lake
.
She
had
her
first
*NL*
sight
of
his
mother
,
except
the
glimpse
at
the
wedding
.
Mrs.
Kennicott
*NL*
had
a
hushed
and
delicate
breeding
which
dignified
her
woodeny
*NL*
over-scrubbed
cottage
with
its
worn
hard
cushions
in
heavy
rockers
.
*NL*
She
had
never
lost
the
child
's
miraculous
power
of
wonder
.
She
asked
*NL*
questions
about
books
and
cities
.
She
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
is
a
dear
hard-working
boy
but
he
's
inclined
to
be
too
serious
,
*NL*
and
you
've
taught
him
how
to
play
.
Last
night
I
heard
you
both
laughing
*NL*
about
the
old
Indian
basket-seller
,
and
I
just
lay
in
bed
and
enjoyed
*NL*
your
happiness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
forgot
her
misery-hunting
in
this
solidarity
of
family
life
.
*NL*
She
could
depend
upon
them
;
she
was
not
battling
alone
.
Watching
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
flit
about
the
kitchen
she
was
better
able
to
translate
*NL*
Kennicott
himself
.
He
was
matter-of-fact
,
yes
,
and
incurably
mature
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
really
play
;
he
let
Carol
play
with
him
.
But
he
had
his
mother
's
*NL*
genius
for
trusting
,
her
disdain
for
prying
,
her
sure
integrity
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
two
days
at
Lac-qui-Meurt
Carol
drew
confidence
in
herself
,
*NL*
and
she
returned
to
Gopher
Prairie
in
a
throbbing
calm
like
those
golden
*NL*
drugged
seconds
when
,
because
he
is
for
an
instant
free
from
pain
,
a
*NL*
sick
man
revels
in
living
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
bright
hard
winter
day
,
the
wind
shrill
,
black
and
silver
clouds
*NL*
booming
across
the
sky
,
everything
in
panicky
motion
during
the
brief
*NL*
light
.
They
struggled
against
the
surf
of
wind
,
through
deep
snow
.
*NL*
Kennicott
was
cheerful
.
He
hailed
Loren
Wheeler
,
``
Behave
yourself
while
*NL*
I
been
away
?
''
The
editor
bellowed
,
``
B
'
gosh
you
stayed
so
long
that
*NL*
all
your
patients
have
got
well
!
''
and
importantly
took
notes
for
the
*NL*
Dauntless
about
their
journey
.
Jackson
Elder
cried
,
``
Hey
,
folks
!
How
's
*NL*
tricks
up
North
?
''
Mrs.
McGanum
waved
to
them
from
her
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
glad
to
see
us
.
We
mean
something
here
.
These
people
are
*NL*
satisfied
.
Why
ca
n't
I
be
?
But
can
I
sit
back
all
my
life
and
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
`
Hey
,
folks
'
?
They
want
shouts
on
Main
Street
,
and
I
want
*NL*
violins
in
a
paneled
room
.
Why
--
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
Sherwin
ran
in
after
school
a
dozen
times
.
She
was
tactful
,
*NL*
torrentially
anecdotal
.
She
had
scuttled
about
town
and
plucked
*NL*
compliments
:
Mrs.
Dr.
Westlake
had
pronounced
Carol
a
``
very
sweet
,
*NL*
bright
,
cultured
young
woman
,
''
and
Brad
Bemis
,
the
tinsmith
at
Clark
's
*NL*
Hardware
Store
,
had
declared
that
she
was
``
easy
to
work
for
and
awful
*NL*
easy
to
look
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Carol
could
not
yet
take
her
in
.
She
resented
this
outsider
's
*NL*
knowledge
of
her
shame
.
Vida
was
not
too
long
tolerant
.
She
hinted
,
*NL*
``
You
're
a
great
brooder
,
child
.
Buck
up
now
.
The
town
's
quit
criticizing
*NL*
you
,
almost
entirely
.
Come
with
me
to
the
Thanatopsis
Club
.
They
*NL*
have
some
of
the
BEST
papers
,
and
current-events
discussions
--
SO
*NL*
interesting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
Vida
's
demands
Carol
felt
a
compulsion
,
but
she
was
too
listless
to
*NL*
obey
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Bea
Sorenson
who
was
really
her
confidante
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
charitable
toward
the
Lower
Classes
she
may
have
thought
*NL*
herself
,
Carol
had
been
reared
to
assume
that
servants
belong
to
*NL*
a
distinct
and
inferior
species
.
But
she
discovered
that
Bea
was
*NL*
extraordinarily
like
girls
she
had
loved
in
college
,
and
as
a
companion
*NL*
altogether
superior
to
the
young
matrons
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
.
Daily
*NL*
they
became
more
frankly
two
girls
playing
at
housework
.
Bea
artlessly
*NL*
considered
Carol
the
most
beautiful
and
accomplished
lady
in
the
*NL*
country
;
she
was
always
shrieking
,
``
My
,
dot
's
a
swell
hat
!
''
or
,
``
Ay
*NL*
t
`
ink
all
dese
ladies
yoost
die
when
dey
see
how
elegant
you
do
your
*NL*
hair
!
''
But
it
was
not
the
humbleness
of
a
servant
,
nor
the
hypocrisy
of
*NL*
a
slave
;
it
was
the
admiration
of
Freshman
for
Junior
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
out
the
day
's
menus
together
.
Though
they
began
with
*NL*
propriety
,
Carol
sitting
by
the
kitchen
table
and
Bea
at
the
sink
or
*NL*
blacking
the
stove
,
the
conference
was
likely
to
end
with
both
of
them
*NL*
by
the
table
,
while
Bea
gurgled
over
the
ice-man
's
attempt
to
kiss
her
,
*NL*
or
Carol
admitted
,
``
Everybody
knows
that
the
doctor
is
lots
more
clever
*NL*
than
Dr.
McGanum
.
''
When
Carol
came
in
from
marketing
,
Bea
plunged
into
*NL*
the
hall
to
take
off
her
coat
,
rub
her
frostied
hands
,
and
ask
,
``
Vos
*NL*
dere
lots
of
folks
up-town
today
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
welcome
upon
which
Carol
depended
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Through
her
weeks
of
cowering
there
was
no
change
in
her
surface
life
.
*NL*
No
one
save
Vida
was
aware
of
her
agonizing
.
On
her
most
despairing
*NL*
days
she
chatted
to
women
on
the
street
,
in
stores
.
But
without
*NL*
the
protection
of
Kennicott
's
presence
she
did
not
go
to
the
Jolly
*NL*
Seventeen
;
she
delivered
herself
to
the
judgment
of
the
town
only
when
*NL*
she
went
shopping
and
on
the
ritualistic
occasions
of
formal
afternoon
*NL*
calls
,
when
Mrs.
Lyman
Cass
or
Mrs.
George
Edwin
Mott
,
with
clean
gloves
*NL*
and
minute
handkerchiefs
and
sealskin
card-cases
and
countenances
of
*NL*
frozen
approbation
,
sat
on
the
edges
of
chairs
and
inquired
,
``
Do
you
*NL*
find
Gopher
Prairie
pleasing
?
''
When
they
spent
evenings
of
social
*NL*
profit-and-loss
at
the
Haydocks
'
or
the
Dyers
'
she
hid
behind
Kennicott
,
*NL*
playing
the
simple
bride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
was
unprotected
.
Kennicott
had
taken
a
patient
to
Rochester
*NL*
for
an
operation
.
He
would
be
away
for
two
or
three
days
.
She
had
not
*NL*
minded
;
she
would
loosen
the
matrimonial
tension
and
be
a
fanciful
girl
*NL*
for
a
time
.
But
now
that
he
was
gone
the
house
was
listeningly
empty
.
*NL*
Bea
was
out
this
afternoon
--
presumably
drinking
coffee
and
talking
about
*NL*
``
fellows
''
with
her
cousin
Tina
.
It
was
the
day
for
the
monthly
supper
*NL*
and
evening-bridge
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
but
Carol
dared
not
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
THE
house
was
haunted
,
long
before
evening
.
Shadows
slipped
down
the
*NL*
walls
and
waited
behind
every
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
that
door
move
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
She
would
n't
go
to
the
Jolly
Seventeen
.
She
had
n't
energy
enough
to
*NL*
caper
before
them
,
to
smile
blandly
at
Juanita
's
rudeness
.
Not
today
.
*NL*
But
she
did
want
a
party
.
Now
!
If
some
one
would
come
in
this
afternoon
,
*NL*
some
one
who
liked
her
--
Vida
or
Mrs.
Sam
Clark
or
old
Mrs.
Champ
Perry
*NL*
or
gentle
Mrs.
Dr.
Westlake
.
Or
Guy
Pollock
!
She
'd
telephone
--
*NL*
*NL*
No
.
That
would
n't
be
it
.
They
must
come
of
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
they
would
.
*NL*
*NL*
Why
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
'd
have
tea
ready
,
anyway
.
If
they
came
--
splendid
.
If
not
--
what
did
*NL*
she
care
?
She
was
n't
going
to
yield
to
the
village
and
let
down
;
she
was
*NL*
going
to
keep
up
a
belief
in
the
rite
of
tea
,
to
which
she
had
always
*NL*
looked
forward
as
the
symbol
of
a
leisurely
fine
existence
.
And
it
would
*NL*
be
just
as
much
fun
,
even
if
it
was
so
babyish
,
to
have
tea
by
herself
*NL*
and
pretend
that
she
was
entertaining
clever
men
.
It
would
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
the
shining
thought
into
action
.
She
bustled
to
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
stoked
the
wood-range
,
sang
Schumann
while
she
boiled
the
kettle
,
warmed
*NL*
up
raisin
cookies
on
a
newspaper
spread
on
the
rack
in
the
oven
.
She
*NL*
scampered
up-stairs
to
bring
down
her
filmiest
tea-cloth
.
She
arranged
*NL*
a
silver
tray
.
She
proudly
carried
it
into
the
living-room
and
set
it
on
*NL*
the
long
cherrywood
table
,
pushing
aside
a
hoop
of
embroidery
,
a
volume
*NL*
of
Conrad
from
the
library
,
copies
of
the
Saturday
Evening
Post
,
the
*NL*
Literary
Digest
,
and
Kennicott
's
National
Geographic
Magazine
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
moved
the
tray
back
and
forth
and
regarded
the
effect
.
She
shook
*NL*
her
head
.
She
busily
unfolded
the
sewing-table
set
it
in
the
bay-window
,
*NL*
patted
the
tea-cloth
to
smoothness
,
moved
the
tray
.
``
Some
time
I
'll
have
*NL*
a
mahogany
tea-table
,
''
she
said
happily
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
brought
in
two
cups
,
two
plates
.
For
herself
,
a
straight
chair
,
*NL*
but
for
the
guest
the
big
wing-chair
,
which
she
pantingly
tugged
to
the
*NL*
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
finished
all
the
preparations
she
could
think
of
.
She
sat
and
*NL*
waited
.
She
listened
for
the
door-bell
,
the
telephone
.
Her
eagerness
was
*NL*
stilled
.
Her
hands
drooped
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surely
Vida
Sherwin
would
hear
the
summons
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
glanced
through
the
bay-window
.
Snow
was
sifting
over
the
ridge
*NL*
of
the
Howland
house
like
sprays
of
water
from
a
hose
.
The
wide
*NL*
yards
across
the
street
were
gray
with
moving
eddies
.
The
black
trees
*NL*
shivered
.
The
roadway
was
gashed
with
ruts
of
ice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
at
the
extra
cup
and
plate
.
She
looked
at
the
wing-chair
.
It
*NL*
was
so
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
tea
was
cold
in
the
pot
.
With
wearily
dipping
fingertip
she
tested
*NL*
it
.
Yes
.
Quite
cold
.
She
could
n't
wait
any
longer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
cup
across
from
her
was
icily
clean
,
glisteningly
empty
.
*NL*
*NL*
Simply
absurd
to
wait
.
She
poured
her
own
cup
of
tea
.
She
sat
and
stared
*NL*
at
it
.
What
was
it
she
was
going
to
do
now
?
Oh
yes
;
how
idiotic
;
take
a
*NL*
lump
of
sugar
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
n't
want
the
beastly
tea
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
springing
up
.
She
was
on
the
couch
,
sobbing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
thinking
more
sharply
than
she
had
for
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
reverted
to
her
resolution
to
change
the
town
--
awaken
it
,
prod
it
,
*NL*
``
reform
''
it
.
What
if
they
were
wolves
instead
of
lambs
?
They
'd
eat
her
*NL*
all
the
sooner
if
she
was
meek
to
them
.
Fight
or
be
eaten
.
It
was
easier
*NL*
to
change
the
town
completely
than
to
conciliate
it
!
She
could
not
take
*NL*
their
point
of
view
;
it
was
a
negative
thing
;
an
intellectual
squalor
;
*NL*
a
swamp
of
prejudices
and
fears
.
She
would
have
to
make
them
take
hers
.
*NL*
She
was
not
a
Vincent
de
Paul
,
to
govern
and
mold
a
people
.
What
of
*NL*
that
?
The
tiniest
change
in
their
distrust
of
beauty
would
be
the
*NL*
beginning
of
the
end
;
a
seed
to
sprout
and
some
day
with
thickening
*NL*
roots
to
crack
their
wall
of
mediocrity
.
If
she
could
not
,
as
she
*NL*
desired
,
do
a
great
thing
nobly
and
with
laughter
,
yet
she
need
not
be
*NL*
content
with
village
nothingness
.
She
would
plant
one
seed
in
the
blank
*NL*
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
she
just
?
Was
it
merely
a
blank
wall
,
this
town
which
to
three
*NL*
thousand
and
more
people
was
the
center
of
the
universe
?
Had
n't
she
,
*NL*
returning
from
Lac-qui-Meurt
,
felt
the
heartiness
of
their
greetings
?
*NL*
No
.
The
ten
thousand
Gopher
Prairies
had
no
monopoly
of
greetings
and
*NL*
friendly
hands
.
Sam
Clark
was
no
more
loyal
than
girl
librarians
she
*NL*
knew
in
St.
Paul
,
the
people
she
had
met
in
Chicago
.
And
those
others
*NL*
had
so
much
that
Gopher
Prairie
complacently
lacked
--
the
world
of
gaiety
*NL*
and
adventure
,
of
music
and
the
integrity
of
bronze
,
of
remembered
*NL*
mists
from
tropic
isles
and
Paris
nights
and
the
walls
of
Bagdad
,
of
*NL*
industrial
justice
and
a
God
who
spake
not
in
doggerel
hymns
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
seed
.
Which
seed
it
was
did
not
matter
.
All
knowledge
and
freedom
*NL*
were
one
.
But
she
had
delayed
so
long
in
finding
that
seed
.
Could
she
*NL*
do
something
with
this
Thanatopsis
Club
?
Or
should
she
make
her
house
*NL*
so
charming
that
it
would
be
an
influence
?
She
'd
make
Kennicott
like
*NL*
poetry
.
That
was
it
,
for
a
beginning
!
She
conceived
so
clear
a
picture
*NL*
of
their
bending
over
large
fair
pages
by
the
fire
-LRB-
in
a
non-existent
*NL*
fireplace
-RRB-
that
the
spectral
presences
slipped
away
.
Doors
no
longer
*NL*
moved
;
curtains
were
not
creeping
shadows
but
lovely
dark
masses
in
the
*NL*
dusk
;
and
when
Bea
came
home
Carol
was
singing
at
the
piano
which
she
*NL*
had
not
touched
for
many
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
supper
was
the
feast
of
two
girls
.
Carol
was
in
the
dining-room
,
*NL*
in
a
frock
of
black
satin
edged
with
gold
,
and
Bea
,
in
blue
gingham
and
*NL*
an
apron
,
dined
in
the
kitchen
;
but
the
door
was
open
between
,
and
*NL*
Carol
was
inquiring
,
``
Did
you
see
any
ducks
in
Dahl
's
window
?
''
and
Bea
*NL*
chanting
,
``
No
,
ma'am
.
Say
,
ve
have
a
svell
time
,
dis
afternoon
.
Tina
she
*NL*
have
coffee
and
knackebrod
,
and
her
fella
vos
dere
,
and
ve
yoost
laughed
*NL*
and
laughed
,
and
her
fella
say
he
vos
president
and
he
going
to
make
*NL*
me
queen
of
Finland
,
and
Ay
stick
a
fedder
in
may
hair
and
say
Ay
bane
*NL*
going
to
go
to
var
--
oh
,
ve
vos
so
foolish
and
ve
LAUGH
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carol
sat
at
the
piano
again
she
did
not
think
of
her
husband
but
*NL*
of
the
book-drugged
hermit
,
Guy
Pollock
.
She
wished
that
Pollock
would
*NL*
come
calling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
a
girl
really
kissed
him
,
he
'd
creep
out
of
his
den
and
be
human
.
If
*NL*
Will
were
as
literate
as
Guy
,
or
Guy
were
as
executive
as
Will
,
I
think
*NL*
I
could
endure
even
Gopher
Prairie
.
It
's
so
hard
to
mother
Will
.
I
*NL*
could
be
maternal
with
Guy
.
Is
that
what
I
want
,
something
to
mother
,
a
*NL*
man
or
a
baby
or
a
town
?
I
WILL
have
a
baby

Some
day
.
But
to
have
him
*NL*
isolated
here
all
his
receptive
years
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
so
to
bed

free

To
think
that
there
was
once
a
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
who
let
herself
worry
over
a
town
called
Gopher
Prairie
when

there
was

III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
A
black
February
day
.
Clouds
hewn
of
ponderous
timber
weighing
down
*NL*
on
the
earth
;
an
irresolute
dropping
of
snow
specks
upon
the
trampled
*NL*
wastes
.
Gloom
but
no
veiling
of
angularity
.
The
lines
of
roofs
and
*NL*
sidewalks
sharp
and
inescapable
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
second
day
of
Kennicott
's
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
fled
from
the
creepy
house
for
a
walk
.
It
was
thirty
below
zero
;
*NL*
too
cold
to
exhilarate
her
.
In
the
spaces
between
houses
the
wind
caught
*NL*
her
.
It
stung
,
it
gnawed
at
nose
and
ears
and
aching
cheeks
,
and
she
*NL*
hastened
from
shelter
to
shelter
,
catching
her
breath
in
the
lee
of
a
*NL*
barn
,
grateful
for
the
protection
of
a
billboard
covered
with
ragged
*NL*
posters
showing
layer
under
layer
of
paste-smeared
green
and
streaky
*NL*
red
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grove
of
oaks
at
the
end
of
the
street
suggested
Indians
,
hunting
,
*NL*
snow-shoes
,
and
she
struggled
past
the
earth-banked
cottages
to
the
*NL*
open
country
,
to
a
farm
and
a
low
hill
corrugated
with
hard
snow
.
In
*NL*
her
loose
nutria
coat
,
seal
toque
,
virginal
cheeks
unmarked
by
lines
of
*NL*
village
jealousies
,
she
was
as
out
of
place
on
this
dreary
hillside
as
*NL*
a
scarlet
tanager
on
an
ice-floe
.
She
looked
down
on
Gopher
Prairie
.
The
*NL*
snow
,
stretching
without
break
from
streets
to
devouring
prairie
beyond
,
*NL*
wiped
out
the
town
's
pretense
of
being
a
shelter
.
The
houses
were
black
*NL*
specks
on
a
white
sheet
.
Her
heart
shivered
with
that
still
loneliness
*NL*
as
her
body
shivered
with
the
wind
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
back
into
the
huddle
of
streets
,
all
the
while
protesting
that
*NL*
she
wanted
a
city
's
yellow
glare
of
shop-windows
and
restaurants
,
or
the
*NL*
primitive
forest
with
hooded
furs
and
a
rifle
,
or
a
barnyard
warm
and
*NL*
steamy
,
noisy
with
hens
and
cattle
,
certainly
not
these
dun
houses
,
*NL*
these
yards
choked
with
winter
ash-piles
,
these
roads
of
dirty
snow
and
*NL*
clotted
frozen
mud
.
The
zest
of
winter
was
gone
.
Three
months
more
,
till
*NL*
May
,
the
cold
might
drag
on
,
with
the
snow
ever
filthier
,
the
weakened
*NL*
body
less
resistent
.
She
wondered
why
the
good
citizens
insisted
on
*NL*
adding
the
chill
of
prejudice
,
why
they
did
not
make
the
houses
of
their
*NL*
spirits
more
warm
and
frivolous
,
like
the
wise
chatterers
of
Stockholm
*NL*
and
Moscow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
circled
the
outskirts
of
the
town
and
viewed
the
slum
of
``
Swede
*NL*
Hollow
.
''
Wherever
as
many
as
three
houses
are
gathered
there
will
be
a
*NL*
slum
of
at
least
one
house
.
In
Gopher
Prairie
,
the
Sam
Clarks
boasted
,
*NL*
``
you
do
n't
get
any
of
this
poverty
that
you
find
in
cities
--
always
*NL*
plenty
of
work
--
no
need
of
charity
--
man
got
to
be
blame
shiftless
if
he
*NL*
do
n't
get
ahead
.
''
But
now
that
the
summer
mask
of
leaves
and
grass
was
*NL*
gone
,
Carol
discovered
misery
and
dead
hope
.
In
a
shack
of
thin
boards
*NL*
covered
with
tar-paper
she
saw
the
washerwoman
,
Mrs.
Steinhof
,
working
*NL*
in
gray
steam
.
Outside
,
her
six-year-old
boy
chopped
wood
.
He
had
a
torn
*NL*
jacket
,
muffler
of
a
blue
like
skimmed
milk
.
His
hands
were
covered
with
*NL*
red
mittens
through
which
protruded
his
chapped
raw
knuckles
.
He
halted
*NL*
to
blow
on
them
,
to
cry
disinterestedly
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
family
of
recently
arrived
Finns
were
camped
in
an
abandoned
stable
.
A
*NL*
man
of
eighty
was
picking
up
lumps
of
coal
along
the
railroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
know
what
to
do
about
it
.
She
felt
that
these
independent
*NL*
citizens
,
who
had
been
taught
that
they
belonged
to
a
democracy
,
would
*NL*
resent
her
trying
to
play
Lady
Bountiful
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lost
her
loneliness
in
the
activity
of
the
village
industries
--
the
*NL*
railroad-yards
with
a
freight-train
switching
,
the
wheat-elevator
,
*NL*
oil-tanks
,
a
slaughter-house
with
blood-marks
on
the
snow
,
the
creamery
*NL*
with
the
sleds
of
farmers
and
piles
of
milk-cans
,
an
unexplained
stone
*NL*
hut
labeled
``
Danger
--
Powder
Stored
Here
.
''
The
jolly
tombstone-yard
,
*NL*
where
a
utilitarian
sculptor
in
a
red
calfskin
overcoat
whistled
as
*NL*
he
hammered
the
shiniest
of
granite
headstones
.
Jackson
Elder
's
small
*NL*
planing-mill
,
with
the
smell
of
fresh
pine
shavings
and
the
burr
of
*NL*
circular
saws
.
Most
important
,
the
Gopher
Prairie
Flour
and
Milling
*NL*
Company
,
Lyman
Cass
president
.
Its
windows
were
blanketed
with
*NL*
flour-dust
,
but
it
was
the
most
stirring
spot
in
town
.
Workmen
were
*NL*
wheeling
barrels
of
flour
into
a
box-car
;
a
farmer
sitting
on
sacks
of
*NL*
wheat
in
a
bobsled
argued
with
the
wheat-buyer
;
machinery
within
the
*NL*
mill
boomed
and
whined
,
water
gurgled
in
the
ice-freed
mill-race
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
clatter
was
a
relief
to
Carol
after
months
of
smug
houses
.
She
*NL*
wished
that
she
could
work
in
the
mill
;
that
she
did
not
belong
to
the
*NL*
caste
of
professional-man
's
-
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
for
home
,
through
the
small
slum
.
Before
a
tar-paper
shack
,
*NL*
at
a
gateless
gate
,
a
man
in
rough
brown
dogskin
coat
and
black
plush
*NL*
cap
with
lappets
was
watching
her
.
His
square
face
was
confident
,
*NL*
his
foxy
mustache
was
picaresque
.
He
stood
erect
,
his
hands
in
his
*NL*
side-pockets
,
his
pipe
puffing
slowly
.
He
was
forty-five
or
-
six
,
*NL*
perhaps
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
do
,
Mrs.
Kennicott
,
''
he
drawled
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
him
--
the
town
handyman
,
who
had
repaired
their
furnace
at
*NL*
the
beginning
of
winter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

she
fluttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

The
Carol

regarded
herself
as
completely
adaptable
was
uncomfortable

at
being
chosen
as
comrade
by
a
pipe-reeking
odd-job

*NL*
*NL*
Bjornstam
was
not
respectfully
valedictory
.
He
showed
no
signs
of
*NL*
pulling
a
forelock
.
His
eyebrows
moved
as
though
they
had
a
life
of
*NL*
their
own
.
With
a
subgrin
he
went
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
I
had

from
her
attitude

departure
into
an

attitude

listening

her

full

her

lowered

fumbled

by
reading
poetry

Me
,
I
want
*NL*
to
yank
it
up
on
the
ways
,
and
fire
the
poor
bum
of
a
shoemaker
that
*NL*
built
it
so
it
sails
crooked
,
and
have
it
rebuilt
right
,
from
the
keel
*NL*
up
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

that

that
would
be
better

must
run
home

nearly
frozen

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
you

come

*NL*
She
looked
doubtfully
at
him
,
at
the
low
shanty
,
the
yard
that
was
*NL*
littered
with
cord-wood
,
moldy
planks
,
a
hoopless
wash-tub
.
She
was
*NL*
disquieted
,
but
Bjornstam
did
not
give
her
the
opportunity
to
be
*NL*
delicate
.
He
flung
out
his
hand
in
a
welcoming
gesture
which
assumed
*NL*
that
she
was
her
own
counselor
,
that
she
was
not
a
Respectable
Married
*NL*
Woman
but
fully
a
human
being
.
With
a
shaky
,
``
Well
,
just
a
moment
,
to
*NL*
warm
my
nose
,
''
she
glanced
down
the
street
to
make
sure
that
she
was
not
*NL*
spied
on
,
and
bolted
toward
the
shanty
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remained
for
one
hour
,
and
never
had
she
known
a
more
considerate
*NL*
host
than
the
Red
Swede
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
but
one
room
:
bare
pine
floor
,
small
work-bench
,
wall
bunk
with
*NL*
amazingly
neat
bed
,
frying-pan
and
ash-stippled
coffee-pot
on
the
*NL*
shelf
behind
the
pot-bellied
cannon-ball
stove
,
backwoods
chairs
--
one
*NL*
constructed
from
half
a
barrel
,
one
from
a
tilted
plank
--
and
a
row
of
*NL*
books
incredibly
assorted
;
Byron
and
Tennyson
and
Stevenson
,
a
manual
of
*NL*
gas-engines
,
a
book
by
Thorstein
Veblen
,
and
a
spotty
treatise
on
``
The
*NL*
Care

Feeding

Diseases
,
and
Breeding
of
Poultry
and
Cattle

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
but
one
picture
--
a
magazine
color-plate
of
a
steep-roofed
*NL*
village
in
the
Harz
Mountains
which
suggested
kobolds
and
maidens
with
*NL*
golden
hair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bjornstam
did
not
fuss
over
her
.
He
suggested
,
``
Might
throw
open
your
*NL*
coat
and
put
your
feet
up
on
the
box
in
front
of
the
stove

''
He
tossed
*NL*
his
dogskin
coat
into
the
bunk
,
lowered
himself
into
the
barrel
chair
,
*NL*
and
droned
on
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yeh
,
I
'm
probably
a
yahoo

by

I
do
keep
my

jobs
,
and
that
's
more
'n
these
polite
cusses
like
the
clerks
*NL*
in
the
banks
do

When
I
'm
rude
to
some
slob

it
may
be
partly
because
I
*NL*
do
n't

God

'm
not
no

on
trick
forks

what

you

with
a
Prince

mostly
it
's
because
I
*NL*
mean
something

I
'm
about

about

*NL*
``
I
meet
old
Ezra

looks
at

he
's
a

worth

real

Common

him

I

off
on

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
He
hitched
out
of
his
chair
,
made
coffee
,
gave
Carol
a
cup
,
and
talked
*NL*
on
,
half
defiant
and
half
apologetic
,
half
wistful
for
friendliness
*NL*
and
half
amused
by
her
surprise
at
the
discovery
that
there
was
a
*NL*
proletarian
philosophy
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
door
,
she
hinted
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bjornstam

*NL*
``

I

care
what
a

dirty
seals
thought
about
my
*NL*

''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
wind
at
her
back
,
it
was
the
thrust
of
Bjornstam
's
scorn
*NL*
which
carried
her
through
town
.
She
faced
Juanita
Haydock
,
cocked
*NL*
her
head
at
Maud
Dyer
's
brief
nod
,
and
came
home
to
Bea
radiant
.
She
*NL*
telephoned
Vida
Sherwin
to
``
run
over
this
evening
.
''
She
lustily
played
*NL*
Tschaikowsky
--
the
virile
chords
an
echo
of
the
red
laughing
philosopher
*NL*
of
the
tar-paper
shack
.
*NL*
*NL*
-LRB-
When
she
hinted
to
Vida
,
``
Is
n't
there
a
man
here
who
amuses
himself
by
*NL*
being
irreverent
to
the

,
some
such
a
name

*NL*
the
reform-leader
said
``

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
returned
at
midnight

At
breakfast
he
said
four
several
*NL*
times
that
he
had
missed
her
every
moment
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
way
to
market
Sam

hailed
her
,
``

round

one
of
these
evenings

n't
be
so
dog-gone

proud
,
staying
by
yourselves

*NL*
*NL*
Champ
Perry
the
pioneer
,
wheat-buyer
at
the
elevator
,
stopped
her
in
*NL*
the
post-office
,
held
her
hand
in
his
withered
paws
,
peered
at
her
*NL*
with
faded
eyes
,
and
chuckled
,
``
You
are
so
fresh
and
blooming
,
my
dear

*NL*
Mother
was
saying
t
`
other
day
that
a
sight
of
you
was
better
'n
a
dose
*NL*
of
medicine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Bon
Ton
Store
she
found
Guy
Pollock
tentatively
buying
a
modest
*NL*
gray
scarf
.
``
We
have
n't
seen
you
for
so
long
,
''
she
said
.
``
Would
n't
you
*NL*
like
to
come
in
and
play
cribbage
,
some
evening
?
''
As
though
he
meant
it
,
*NL*
Pollock
begged
,
``
May
I
,
really
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
purchasing
two
yards
of
malines
the
vocal
Raymie
*NL*
Wutherspoon
tiptoed
up
to
her
,
his
long
sallow
face
bobbing
,
and
he
*NL*
besought
,
``
You
've
just
got
to
come
back
to
my
department
and
see
a
pair
*NL*
of
patent
leather
slippers
I
set
aside
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
manner
of
more
than
sacerdotal
reverence
he
unlaced
her
boots
,
*NL*
tucked
her
skirt
about
her
ankles
,
slid
on
the
slippers
.
She
took
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
good
salesman
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
not
a
salesman
at
all
!
I
just
like
elegant
things
.
All
this
is
so
*NL*
inartistic
.
''
He
indicated
with
a
forlornly
waving
hand
the
shelves
of
*NL*
shoe-boxes
,
the
seat
of
thin
wood
perforated
in
rosettes
,
the
display
of
*NL*
shoe-trees
and
tin
boxes
of
blacking
,
the
lithograph
of
a
smirking
*NL*
young
woman
with
cherry
cheeks
who
proclaimed
in
the
exalted
poetry
of
*NL*
advertising
,
``
My
tootsies
never
got
hep
to
what
pedal
perfection
was
*NL*
till
I
got
a
pair
of
clever
classy
Cleopatra
Shoes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
sometimes
,
''
Raymie
sighed
,
``
there
is
a
pair
of
dainty
little
shoes
*NL*
like
these
,
and
I
set
them
aside
for
some
one
who
will
appreciate
.
When
*NL*
I
saw
these
I
said
right
away
,
`
Would
n't
it
be
nice
if
they
fitted
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
,

and
I
meant
to
speak
to
you
first
chance
I
had
.
I
have
n't
*NL*
forgotten
our
jolly
talks
at
Mrs.
Gurrey
's
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
Guy
Pollock
came
in
and
,
though
Kennicott
instantly
*NL*
impressed
him
into
a
cribbage
game
,
Carol
was
happy
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
,
in
recovering
something
of
her
buoyancy
,
forget
her
*NL*
determination
to
begin
the
liberalizing
of
Gopher
Prairie
by
the
easy
*NL*
and
agreeable
propaganda
of
teaching
Kennicott
to
enjoy
reading
poetry
*NL*
in
the
lamplight
.
The
campaign
was
delayed
.
Twice
he
suggested
that
they
*NL*
call
on
neighbors
;
once
he
was
in
the
country
.
The
fourth
evening
*NL*
he
yawned
pleasantly
,
stretched
,
and
inquired
,
``
Well
,
what
'll
we
do
*NL*
tonight
?
Shall
we
go
to
the
movies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
exactly
what
we
're
going
to
do

Now
do
n't
ask
questions
!
Come
*NL*
and
sit
down
by
the
table
.
There
,
are
you
comfy
?
Lean
back
and
forget
*NL*
you
're
a
practical
man
,
and
listen
to
me

*NL*
*NL*
It
may
be
that
she
had
been
influenced
by
the
managerial
Vida
Sherwin
;
*NL*
certainly
she
sounded
as
though
she
was
selling
culture
.
But
she
dropped
*NL*
it
when
she
sat
on
the
couch
,
her
chin
in
her
hands
,
a
volume
of
Yeats
*NL*
on
her
knees
,
and
read
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
Instantly
she
was
released
from
the
homely
comfort
of
a
prairie
town
.
*NL*
She
was
in
the
world
of
lonely
things
--
the
flutter
of
twilight
linnets
,
*NL*
the
aching
call
of
gulls
along
a
shore
to
which
the
netted
foam
crept
*NL*
out
of
darkness
,
the
island
of
Aengus
and
the
elder
gods
and
the
eternal
*NL*
glories
that
never
were
,
tall
kings
and
women
girdled
with
crusted
gold
,
*NL*
the
woful
incessant
chanting
and
the
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heh-cha-cha
!
''
coughed
Dr.
Kennicott
.
She
stopped
.
She
remembered
that
*NL*
he
was
the
sort
of
person
who
chewed
tobacco
.
She
glared
,
while
he
*NL*
uneasily
petitioned
,
``
That
's
great
stuff
.
Study
it
in
college
?
I
*NL*
like
poetry
fine

James
Whitcomb
Riley
and
some
of
Longfellow

wish
I
could
appreciate
that
highbrow

But
*NL*
I
guess
I
'm
too
old
a
dog
to
learn
new
tricks

*NL*
*NL*
With
pity
for
his
bewilderment
,
and
a
certain
desire
to
giggle
,
she
*NL*
consoled
him
,
``
Then
let
's
try
some
Tennyson
.
You
've
read
him

*NL*
*NL*
``

there

that

met
a
little
country
boy
who

I
do
n't
remember
exactly
how
it
goes
,
*NL*
but
the
chorus
ends
up
,

*NL*
``
Yes

full

*NL*
*NL*
``
Go

But
he
hastened
to
shelter
himself
behind
a
cigar
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
transported
to
Camelot
.
She
read
with
an
eye
cocked
on
him
,
*NL*
and
when
she
saw
how
much
he
was
suffering
she
ran
to
him
,
kissed
his
*NL*
forehead
,
cried
,
``
You
poor
forced
tube-rose

*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
quite
give
up
.
She
read
Kipling
,
with
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
emphasis
:

He
tapped
his
foot
to
the
rhythm
;
he
looked
normal
and
reassured
.
But
*NL*
when
he
complimented
her
,
``
That

n't
know

she
banged
the
book
and
*NL*
suggested
that
they
were
not
too
late
for
the
nine
o'clock
show
at

*NL*
That
was
her
last
effort
to
harvest
the
April
wind
,
to
teach
divine
*NL*
unhappiness
by
a
correspondence
course
,
to
buy
the
lilies
of
Avalon
and
*NL*
the
sunsets
of
Cockaigne
in
tin
cans
at
Ole
Jenson
's
Grocery
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
fact
is
that
at
the
motion-pictures
she
discovered
herself
*NL*
laughing
as
heartily
as
Kennicott
at
the
humor
of
an
actor
who
stuffed
*NL*
spaghetti
down
a
woman
's
evening
frock
.
For
a
second
she
loathed
her
*NL*
laughter
;
mourned
for
the
day
when
on
her
hill
by
the
Mississippi
*NL*
she
had
walked
the
battlements
with
queens
.
But
the
celebrated
cinema
*NL*
jester
's
conceit
of
dropping
toads
into
a
soup-plate
flung
her
into
*NL*
unwilling
tittering
,
and
the
afterglow
faded
,
the
dead
queens
fled
*NL*
through
darkness
.

*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
to
the
Jolly
Seventeen
's
afternoon
bridge
.
She
had
learned
*NL*
the
elements
of
the
game
from
the
Sam
Clarks
.
She
played
quietly
and
*NL*
reasonably
badly
.
She
had
no
opinions
on
anything
more
polemic
than
*NL*
woolen
union-suits
,
a
topic
on
which
Mrs.
Howland
discoursed
for
five
*NL*
minutes
.
She
smiled
frequently
,
and
was
the
complete
canary-bird
in
her
*NL*
manner
of
thanking
the
hostess
,
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
only
anxious
period
was
during
the
conference
on
husbands
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
matrons
discussed
the
intimacies
of
domesticity
with
a
*NL*
frankness
and
a
minuteness
which
dismayed
Carol
.
Juanita
Haydock
*NL*
communicated
Harry
's
method
of
shaving
,
and
his
interest
in
*NL*
deer-shooting
.
Mrs.
Gougerling
reported
fully
,
and
with
some
irritation
,
*NL*
her
husband
's
inappreciation
of
liver
and
bacon
.
Maud
Dyer
chronicled
*NL*
Dave
's
digestive
disorders
;
quoted
a
recent
bedtime
controversy
with
*NL*
him
in
regard
to
Christian
Science
,
socks
and
the
sewing
of
buttons
*NL*
upon
vests
;
announced
that
she
``
simply
was
n't
going
to
stand
his
always
*NL*
pawing
girls
when
he
went
and
got
crazy-jealous
if
a
man
just
danced
*NL*
with
her
''
;
and
rather
more
than
sketched
Dave
's
varieties
of
kisses
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
meekly
did
Carol
give
attention
,
so
obviously
was
she
at
last
*NL*
desirous
of
being
one
of
them
,
that
they
looked
on
her
fondly
,
and
*NL*
encouraged
her
to
give
such
details
of
her
honeymoon
as
might
be
of
*NL*
interest
.
She
was
embarrassed
rather
than
resentful
.
She
deliberately
*NL*
misunderstood
.
She
talked
of
Kennicott
's
overshoes
and
medical
ideals
*NL*
till
they
were
thoroughly
bored
.
They
regarded
her
as
agreeable
but
*NL*
green
.
*NL*
*NL*
Till
the
end
she
labored
to
satisfy
the
inquisition
.
She
bubbled
at
*NL*
Juanita
,
the
president
of
the
club
,
that
she
wanted
to
entertain
them
.
*NL*
``
Only
,
''
she
said
,
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
can
give
you
any
refreshments
as
*NL*
nice
as
Mrs.
Dyer
's

delicious

'll

tickled
to

At

so
much

``
Oh
,
that
's
nothing

so
good

If

you
'd
find
out

realize
that

Did
you
know
that
Percy

famous

came
from

Yes

I
think
that
a

would
be
awfully
cunning

Early
in
March
Mrs.
Westlake
,
wife
of
the
veteran
physician
,
marched
*NL*
into
Carol
's
living-room
like
an
amiable
old
pussy
and
suggested
,
``
My
*NL*
dear
,
you
really
must
come
to

Thanatopsis

afternoon

Mrs.

Dawson

the
poor
soul

frightened

wanted

*NL*
``
Oh

we
're
not
so
slow

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Luke
Dawson
,
wife
of
the
richest
man
in
town
,
gaped
at
them
*NL*
piteously
when
they
appeared
.
Her
expensive
frock
of
beaver-colored
*NL*
satin
with
rows
,
plasters
,
and
pendants
of
solemn
brown
beads
was
*NL*
intended
for
a
woman
twice
her
size
.
She
stood
wringing
her
hands
in
*NL*
front
of
nineteen
folding
chairs
,
in
her
front
parlor
with
its
faded
*NL*
photograph
of
Minnehaha
Falls
in
1890
,
its
``
colored
enlargement

of

Mr.
Dawson
,
its
bulbous
lamp
painted
with
sepia
cows
and
mountains
and
*NL*
standing
on
a
mortuary
marble
column
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
creaked
,
``
O
Mrs.
Kennicott
,
I
'm
in
such
a
fix
.
I
'm
supposed
to
lead
*NL*
the
discussion
,
and
I
wondered
would
you
come
and
help
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
poet

take
up
today

''
demanded
Carol
,
in
her

tone
of
*NL*
``

yes

learning
all
of
European
Literature

The

gets
such
a
nice
magazine
,
Culture
Hints
,
and
we
follow
its

programs

Last

our

up

up
with
all

improving

So
will
you
help
us
with
the

today

''
*NL*
*NL*
On
her
way
over
Carol
had
decided
to
use
the
Thanatopsis
as
the
tool
*NL*
with
which
to
liberalize
the
town
.
She
had
immediately
conceived
*NL*
enormous
enthusiasm
;
she
had
chanted
,
``
These
are
the
real
people
.
When
*NL*
the
housewives
,
who
bear
the
burdens
,
are
interested
in
poetry
,
it
means
*NL*
something
.
I
'll
work
with
them
--
for
them
--
anything
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
enthusiasm
had
become
watery
even
before
thirteen
women
resolutely
*NL*
removed
their
overshoes
,
sat
down
meatily
,
ate
peppermints
,
dusted
their
*NL*
fingers
,
folded
their
hands
,
composed
their
lower
thoughts
,
and
invited
*NL*
the
naked
muse
of
poetry
to
deliver
her
most
improving
message
.
They
had
*NL*
greeted
Carol
affectionately
,
and
she
tried
to
be
a
daughter
to
them
.
*NL*
But
she
felt
insecure
.
Her
chair
was
out
in
the
open
,
exposed
to
their
*NL*
gaze
,
and
it
was
a
hard-slatted
,
quivery
,
slippery
church-parlor
chair
,
*NL*
likely
to
collapse
publicly
and
without
warning
.
It
was
impossible
to
*NL*
sit
on
it
without
folding
the
hands
and
listening
piously
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
kick
the
chair
and
run
.
It
would
make
a
magnificent
*NL*
clatter
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
Vida
Sherwin
was
watching
her
.
She
pinched
her
wrist
,
as
*NL*
though
she
were
a
noisy
child
in
church
,
and
when
she
was
decent
and
*NL*
cramped
again
,
she
listened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dawson
opened
the
meeting
by
sighing
,
``
I
'm
sure
I
'm
glad
to
see
you
*NL*
all
here
today
,
and
I
understand
that
the
ladies
have
prepared
a
number
*NL*
of
very
interesting
papers
,
this
is
such
an
interesting
subject
,
the
*NL*
poets
,
they
have
been
an
inspiration
for
higher
thought
,
in
fact
was
n't
*NL*
it
Reverend
Benlick
who
said
that
some
of
the
poets
have
been
as
much
an
*NL*
inspiration
as
a
good
many
of
the
ministers
,
and
so
we
shall
be
glad
to
*NL*
hear
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poor
lady
smiled
neuralgically
,
panted
with
fright
,
scrabbled
about
*NL*
the
small
oak
table
to
find
her
eye-glasses
,
and
continued
,
``
We
*NL*
will
first
have
the
pleasure
of
hearing
Mrs.
Jenson
on
the
subject
*NL*
`
Shakespeare
and
Milton
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Ole
Jenson
said
that
Shakespeare
was
born
in
1564
and
died
1616
.
He
*NL*
lived
in
London
,
England
,
and
in
Stratford-on-Avon
,
which
many
American
*NL*
tourists
loved
to
visit
,
a
lovely
town
with
many
curios
and
old
houses
*NL*
well
worth
examination
.
Many
people
believed
that
Shakespeare
was
the
*NL*
greatest
play-wright
who
ever
lived
,
also
a
fine
poet
.
Not
much
was
*NL*
known
about
his
life
,
but
after
all
that
did
not
really
make
so
much
*NL*
difference
,
because
they
loved
to
read
his
numerous
plays
,
several
of
*NL*
the
best
known
of
which
she
would
now
criticize
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
best
known
of
his
plays
was
``
The
Merchant
of
Venice
,
''
having
*NL*
a
beautiful
love
story
and
a
fine
appreciation
of
a
woman
's
brains
,
*NL*
which
a
woman
's
club
,
even
those
who
did
not
care
to
commit
themselves
*NL*
on
the
question
of
suffrage
,
ought
to
appreciate

Mrs.
*NL*
Jenson
was
sure
that
she
,
for
one
,
would
love
to
be
like
Portia
.
The
*NL*
play
was
about
a
Jew
named
Shylock
,
and
he
did
n't
want
his
daughter
to
*NL*
marry
a
Venice
gentleman
named

Mrs.
Leonard
Warren

a
slender
,
gray
,
nervous
woman
,
president
of
the
*NL*
Thanatopsis
and
wife
of
the
Congregational
pastor
,
reported
the
birth
*NL*
and
death
dates
of
Byron
,
Scott
,
Moore
,
Burns
;
and
wound
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Burns
was
quite
a
poor
boy
and
he
did
not
enjoy
the
advantages
we
enjoy
*NL*
today
,
except
for
the
advantages
of
the
fine
old
Scotch
kirk
where
he
*NL*
heard
the
Word
of
God
preached
more
fearlessly
than
even
in
the
finest
*NL*
big
brick
churches
in
the
big
and
so-called
advanced
cities
of
today
,
*NL*
but
he
did
not
have
our
educational
advantages
and
Latin
and
the
other
*NL*
treasures
of
the
mind
so
richly
strewn
before
the
,
alas
,
too
ofttimes
*NL*
inattentive
feet
of
our
youth
who
do
not
always
sufficiently
appreciate
*NL*
the
privileges
freely
granted
to
every
American
boy
rich
or
poor
.
Burns
*NL*
had
to
work
hard
and
was
sometimes
led
by
evil
companionship
into
low
*NL*
habits
.
But
it
is
morally
instructive
to
know
that
he
was
a
good
*NL*
student
and
educated
himself
,
in
striking
contrast
to
the
loose
ways
and
*NL*
so-called
aristocratic
society-life
of
Lord
Byron
,
on
which
I
have
just
*NL*
spoken
.
And
certainly
though
the
lords
and
earls
of
his
day
may
have
*NL*
looked
down
upon
Burns
as
a
humble
person
,
many
of
us
have
greatly
*NL*
enjoyed
his
pieces
about
the
mouse
and
other
rustic
subjects
,
with
their
*NL*
message
of
humble
beauty

I
am
so
sorry
I
have
not
got
the
time
to
quote
*NL*
some

to
stir
her
tears
.
``
But
they
're
so
*NL*
self-satisfied
.
They
think
they
're
doing
Burns
a
favor
.
They
do
n't
*NL*
believe
they
have
a
`
belated
quest
.
'
They
're
sure
that
they
have
culture
*NL*
salted
and
hung
up

''
It
was
out
of
this
stupor
of
doubt
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Dawson
's
summons
roused
her
.
She
was
in
a
panic
.
How
could
she
speak
*NL*
without
hurting
them
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Champ
Perry
leaned
over
to
stroke
her
hand
and
whisper
,
``
You
look
*NL*
tired
,
dearie
.
Do
n't
you
talk
unless
you
want
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Affection
flooded
Carol
;
she
was
on
her
feet
,
searching
for
words
and
*NL*
courtesies
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
only
thing
in
the
way
of
suggestion
--
I
know
you
are
following
*NL*
a
definite
program
,
but
I
do
wish
that
now
you
've
had
such
a
splendid
*NL*
introduction
,
instead
of
going
on
with
some
other
subject
next
year
you
*NL*
could
return
and
take
up
the
poets
more
in
detail
.
Especially
actual
*NL*
quotations
--
even
though
their
lives
are
so
interesting
and
,
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Warren
said
,
so
morally
instructive
.
And
perhaps
there
are
several
poets
*NL*
not
mentioned
today
whom
it
might
be
worth
while
considering
--
Keats
,
for
*NL*
instance
,
and
Matthew
Arnold
and
Rossetti
and
Swinburne
.
Swinburne
would
*NL*
be
such
a
--
well
,
that
is
,
such
a
contrast
to
life
as
we
all
enjoy
it
in
*NL*
our
beautiful
Middle-west
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
Mrs.
Leonard
Warren
was
not
with
her
.
She
captured
her
by
*NL*
innocently
continuing
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Unless
perhaps
Swinburne
tends
to
be
,
uh
,
more
outspoken
than
you
,
than
*NL*
we
really
like
.
What
do
you
think
,
Mrs.
Warren
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
pastor
's
wife
decided
,
``
Why
,
you
've
caught
my
very
thoughts
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
.
Of
course
I
have
never
READ
Swinburne
,
but
years
ago
,
when
*NL*
he
was
in
vogue
,
I
remember
Mr.
Warren
saying
that
Swinburne
-LRB-
or
was
*NL*
it
Oscar
Wilde
?
but
anyway
:-RRB-
he
said
that
though
many
so-called
*NL*
intellectual
people
posed
and
pretended
to
find
beauty
in
Swinburne
,
*NL*
there
can
never
be
genuine
beauty
without
the
message
from
the
heart
.
*NL*
But
at
the
same
time
I
do
think
you
have
an
excellent
idea
,
and
though
*NL*
we
have
talked
about
Furnishings
and
China
as
the
probable
subject
for
*NL*
next
year
,
I
believe
that
it
would
be
nice
if
the
program
committee
*NL*
would
try
to
work
in
another
day
entirely
devoted
to
English
poetry
!
In
*NL*
fact
,
Madame
Chairman
,
I
so
move
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mrs.
Dawson
's
coffee
and
angel
's
-
food
had
helped
them
to
recover
*NL*
from
the
depression
caused
by
thoughts
of
Shakespeare
's
death
they
all
*NL*
told
Carol
that
it
was
a
pleasure
to
have
her
with
them
.
The
membership
*NL*
committee
retired
to
the
sitting-room
for
three
minutes
and
elected
her
*NL*
a
member
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
stopped
being
patronizing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
be
one
of
them
.
They
were
so
loyal
and
kind
.
It
was
they
*NL*
who
would
carry
out
her
aspiration
.
Her
campaign
against
village
sloth
*NL*
was
actually
begun
!
On
what
specific
reform
should
she
first
loose
*NL*
her
army
?
During
the
gossip
after
the
meeting
Mrs.
George
Edwin
Mott
*NL*
remarked
that
the
city
hall
seemed
inadequate
for
the
splendid
modern
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
Mrs.
Nat
Hicks
timidly
wished
that
the
young
people
*NL*
could
have
free
dances
there
--
the
lodge
dances
were
so
exclusive
.
The
*NL*
city
hall
.
That
was
it
!
Carol
hurried
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
not
realized
that
Gopher
Prairie
was
a
city
.
From
Kennicott
she
*NL*
discovered
that
it
was
legally
organized
with
a
mayor
and
city-council
*NL*
and
wards
.
She
was
delighted
by
the
simplicity
of
voting
one
's
self
a
*NL*
metropolis
.
Why
not
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
a
proud
and
patriotic
citizen
,
all
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
examined
the
city
hall
,
next
morning
.
She
had
remembered
it
only
as
*NL*
a
bleak
inconspicuousness
.
She
found
it
a
liver-colored
frame
coop
half
*NL*
a
block
from
Main
Street
.
The
front
was
an
unrelieved
wall
of
clapboards
*NL*
and
dirty
windows
.
It
had
an
unobstructed
view
of
a
vacant
lot
and
Nat
*NL*
Hicks
's
tailor
shop
.
It
was
larger
than
the
carpenter
shop
beside
it
,
*NL*
but
not
so
well
built
.
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
was
about
.
She
walked
into
the
corridor
.
On
one
side
was
the
*NL*
municipal
court
,
like
a
country
school
;
on
the
other
,
the
room
of
the
*NL*
volunteer
fire
company
,
with
a
Ford
hose-cart
and
the
ornamental
helmets
*NL*
used
in
parades
,
at
the
end
of
the
hall
,
a
filthy
two-cell
jail
,
now
*NL*
empty
but
smelling
of
ammonia
and
ancient
sweat
.
The
whole
second
story
*NL*
was
a
large
unfinished
room
littered
with
piles
of
folding
chairs
,
a
*NL*
lime-crusted
mortar-mixing
box
,
and
the
skeletons
of
Fourth
of
July
*NL*
floats
covered
with
decomposing
plaster
shields
and
faded
red
,
white
,
*NL*
and
blue
bunting
.
At
the
end
was
an
abortive
stage
.
The
room
was
large
*NL*
enough
for
the
community
dances
which
Mrs.
Nat
Hicks
advocated
.
But
*NL*
Carol
was
after
something
bigger
than
dances
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
afternoon
she
scampered
to
the
public
library
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
library
was
open
three
afternoons
and
four
evenings
a
week
.
It
was
*NL*
housed
in
an
old
dwelling
,
sufficient
but
unattractive
.
Carol
caught
*NL*
herself
picturing
pleasanter
reading-rooms
,
chairs
for
children
,
an
art
*NL*
collection
,
a
librarian
young
enough
to
experiment
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
berated
herself
,
``
Stop
this
fever
of
reforming
everything
!
I
WILL
be
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
library
!
The
city
hall
is
enough
for
a
beginning
.
*NL*
And
it
's
really
an
excellent
library
.
It
's
--
it
is
n't
so
bad
...
Is
*NL*
it
possible
that
I
am
to
find
dishonesties
and
stupidity
in
every
*NL*
human
activity
I
encounter
?
In
schools
and
business
and
government
and
*NL*
everything
?
Is
there
never
any
contentment
,
never
any
rest
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
her
head
as
though
she
were
shaking
off
water
,
and
hastened
*NL*
into
the
library
,
a
young
,
light
,
amiable
presence
,
modest
in
unbuttoned
*NL*
fur
coat
,
blue
suit
,
fresh
organdy
collar
,
and
tan
boots
roughened
from
*NL*
scuffling
snow
.
Miss
Villets
stared
at
her
,
and
Carol
purred
,
``
I
was
so
*NL*
sorry
not
to
see
you
at
the
Thanatopsis
yesterday
.
Vida
said
you
might
*NL*
come
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
.
You
went
to
the
Thanatopsis
.
Did
you
enjoy
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
much
.
Such
good
papers
on
the
poets
.
''
Carol
lied
resolutely
.
``
But
I
*NL*
did
think
they
should
have
had
you
give
one
of
the
papers
on
poetry
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
Of
course
I
'm
not
one
of
the
bunch
that
seem
to
have
the
*NL*
time
to
take
and
run
the
club
,
and
if
they
prefer
to
have
papers
on
*NL*
literature
by
other
ladies
who
have
no
literary
training
--
after
all
,
why
*NL*
should
I
complain
?
What
am
I
but
a
city
employee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
not
!
You
're
the
one
person
that
does
--
that
does
--
oh

you
do
so
*NL*
much
.
Tell
me
,
is
there
,
uh

Who
are
the
people
who
control
the
club

*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Villets
emphatically
stamped
a
date
in
the
front
of
``
Frank
on
the
*NL*
Lower
Mississippi
''
for
a
small
flaxen
boy
,
glowered
at
him
as
though
she
*NL*
were
stamping
a
warning
on
his
brain
,
and
sighed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
n't
put
myself
forward
or
criticize
any
one
for
the
world
,
and
*NL*
Vida
is
one
of
my
best
friends
,
and
such
a
splendid
teacher
,
and
there
*NL*
is
no
one
in
town
more
advanced
and
interested
in
all
movements
,
but
I
*NL*
must
say
that
no
matter
who
the
president
or
the
committees
are
,
Vida
*NL*
Sherwin
seems
to
be
behind
them
all
the
time
,
and
though
she
is
always
*NL*
telling
me
about
what
she
is
pleased
to
call
my
`
fine
work
in
the
*NL*
library
,
'
I
notice
that
I
'm
not
often
called
on
for
papers
,
though
Mrs.
*NL*
Lyman
Cass
once
volunteered
and
told
me
that
she
thought
my
paper
on
*NL*
`
The
Cathedrals
of
England
'
was
the
most
interesting
paper
we
had
,
the
*NL*
year
we
took
up
English
and
French
travel
and
architecture
.
But
--
And
*NL*
of
course
Mrs.
Mott
and
Mrs.
Warren
are
very
important
in
the
club
,
as
*NL*
you
might
expect
of
the
wives
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
and
*NL*
the
Congregational
pastor
,
and
indeed
they
are
both
very
cultured
,
*NL*
but
--
No
,
you
may
regard
me
as
entirely
unimportant
.
I
'm
sure
what
I
*NL*
say
does
n't
matter
a
bit
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
much
too
modest
,
and
I
'm
going
to
tell
Vida
so
,
and
,
uh
,
I
*NL*
wonder
if
you
can
give
me
just
a
teeny
bit
of
your
time
and
show
me
*NL*
where
the
magazine
files
are
kept

*NL*
*NL*
She
had
won
.
She
was
profusely
escorted
to
a
room
like
a
grandmother
's
*NL*
attic
,
where
she
discovered
periodicals
devoted
to
house-decoration
and
*NL*
town-planning
,
with
a
six-year
file
of
the
National
Geographic
.
Miss
*NL*
Villets
blessedly
left
her
alone
.
Humming
,
fluttering
pages
with
*NL*
delighted
fingers
,
Carol
sat
cross-legged
on
the
floor
,
the
magazines
in
*NL*
heaps
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
pictures
of
New
England
streets
:
the
dignity
of
Falmouth
,
the
*NL*
charm
of
Concord
,
Stockbridge
and
Farmington
and
Hillhouse
Avenue
.
The
*NL*
fairy-book
suburb
of
Forest
Hills
on
Long
Island
.
Devonshire
cottages
*NL*
and
Essex
manors
and
a
Yorkshire
High
Street
and
Port
Sunlight
.
The
*NL*
Arab
village
of
Djeddah
--
an
intricately
chased
jewel-box
.
A
town
in
*NL*
California
which
had
changed
itself
from
the
barren
brick
fronts
and
*NL*
slatternly
frame
sheds
of
a
Main
Street
to
a
way
which
led
the
eye
down
*NL*
a
vista
of
arcades
and
gardens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Assured
that
she
was
not
quite
mad
in
her
belief
that
a
small
American
*NL*
town
might
be
lovely
,
as
well
as
useful
in
buying
wheat
and
selling
*NL*
plows
,
she
sat
brooding
,
her
thin
fingers
playing
a
tattoo
on
her
*NL*
cheeks
.
She
saw
in
Gopher
Prairie
a
Georgian
city
hall
:
warm
brick
walls
*NL*
with
white
shutters
,
a
fanlight
,
a
wide
hall
and
curving
stair
.
She
*NL*
saw
it
the
common
home
and
inspiration
not
only
of
the
town
but
of
*NL*
the
country
about
.
It
should
contain
the
court-room
-LRB-
she
could
n't
get
*NL*
herself
to
put
in
a
jail
-RRB-
,
public
library
,
a
collection
of
excellent
*NL*
prints
,
rest-room
and
model
kitchen
for
farmwives
,
theater
,
lecture
*NL*
room
,
free
community
ballroom
,
farm-bureau
,
gymnasium
.
Forming
about
it
*NL*
and
influenced
by
it
,
as
mediaeval
villages
gathered
about
the
castle
,
*NL*
she
saw
a
new
Georgian
town
as
graceful
and
beloved
as
Annapolis
or
that
*NL*
bowery
Alexandria
to
which
Washington
rode
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
the
Thanatopsis
Club
was
to
accomplish
with
no
difficulty
*NL*
whatever
,
since
its
several
husbands
were
the
controllers
of
business
*NL*
and
politics
.
She
was
proud
of
herself
for
this
practical
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
taken
only
half
an
hour
to
change
a
wire-fenced
potato-plot
into
*NL*
a
walled
rose-garden
.
She
hurried
out
to
apprize
Mrs.
Leonard
Warren
,
as
*NL*
president
of
the
Thanatopsis
,
of
the
miracle
which
had
been
worked
.

*NL*
*NL*
At
a
quarter
to
three
Carol
had
left
home
;
at
half-past
four
she
had
*NL*
created
the
Georgian
town
;
at
a
quarter
to
five
she
was
in
the
dignified
*NL*
poverty
of
the
Congregational
parsonage
,
her
enthusiasm
pattering
upon
*NL*
Mrs.
Leonard
Warren
like
summer
rain
upon
an
old
gray
roof
;
at
two
*NL*
minutes
to
five
a
town
of
demure
courtyards
and
welcoming
dormer
windows
*NL*
had
been
erected
,
and
at
two
minutes
past
five
the
entire
town
was
as
*NL*
flat
as
Babylon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erect
in
a
black
William
and
Mary
chair
against
gray
and
speckly-brown
*NL*
volumes
of
sermons
and
Biblical
commentaries
and
Palestine
geographies
*NL*
upon
long
pine
shelves
,
her
neat
black
shoes
firm
on
a
rag-rug
,
herself
*NL*
as
correct
and
low-toned
as
her
background
,
Mrs.
Warren
listened
without
*NL*
comment
till
Carol
was
quite
through
,
then
answered
delicately
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
think
you
draw
a
very
nice
picture
of
what
might
easily
come
to
*NL*
pass
--
some
day
.
I
have
no
doubt
that
such
villages
will
be
found
on
the
*NL*
prairie
--
some
day
.
But
if
I
might
make
just
the
least
little
criticism
:
*NL*
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
wrong
in
supposing
either
that
the
city
hall
*NL*
would
be
the
proper
start
,
or
that
the
Thanatopsis
would
be
the
right
*NL*
instrument
.
After
all
,
it
's
the
churches
,
is
n't
it
,
that
are
the
*NL*
real
heart
of
the
community
.
As
you
may
possibly
know
,
my
husband
*NL*
is
prominent
in
Congregational
circles
all
through
the
state
for
*NL*
his
advocacy
of
church-union
.
He
hopes
to
see
all
the
evangelical
*NL*
denominations
joined
in
one
strong
body
,
opposing
Catholicism
and
*NL*
Christian
Science
,
and
properly
guiding
all
movements
that
make
for
*NL*
morality
and
prohibition
.
Here
,
the
combined
churches
could
afford
*NL*
a
splendid
club-house
,
maybe
a
stucco
and
half-timber
building
with
*NL*
gargoyles
and
all
sorts
of
pleasing
decorations
on
it
,
which
,
it
seems
*NL*
to
me
,
would
be
lots
better
to
impress
the
ordinary
class
of
people
than
*NL*
just
a
plain
old-fashioned
colonial
house
,
such
as
you
describe
.
And
*NL*
that
would
be
the
proper
center
for
all
educational
and
pleasurable
*NL*
activities
,
instead
of
letting
them
fall
into
the
hands
of
the
*NL*
politicians
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
suppose
it
will
take
more
than
thirty
or
forty
years
for
the
*NL*
churches
to
get
together
?
''
Carol
said
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hardly
that
long
even
;
things
are
moving
so
rapidly
.
So
it
would
be
a
*NL*
mistake
to
make
any
other
plans
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
not
recover
her
zeal
till
two
days
after
,
when
she
tried
Mrs.
*NL*
George
Edwin
Mott
,
wife
of
the
superintendent
of
schools
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Mott
commented
,
``
Personally
,
I
am
terribly
busy
with
dressmaking
*NL*
and
having
the
seamstress
in
the
house
and
all
,
but
it
would
be
splendid
*NL*
to
have
the
other
members
of
the
Thanatopsis
take
up
the
question
.
*NL*
Except
for
one
thing
:
First
and
foremost
,
we
must
have
a
new
*NL*
schoolbuilding
.
Mr.
Mott
says
they
are
terribly
cramped
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
went
to
view
the
old
building
.
The
grades
and
the
high
school
were
*NL*
combined
in
a
damp
yellow-brick
structure
with
the
narrow
windows
of
an
*NL*
antiquated
jail
--
a
hulk
which
expressed
hatred
and
compulsory
training
.
*NL*
She
conceded
Mrs.
Mott
's
demand
so
violently
that
for
two
days
she
*NL*
dropped
her
own
campaign
.
Then
she
built
the
school
and
city
hall
*NL*
together
,
as
the
center
of
the
reborn
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ventured
to
the
lead-colored
dwelling
of
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
.
Behind
the
*NL*
mask
of
winter-stripped
vines
and
a
wide
porch
only
a
foot
above
the
*NL*
ground
,
the
cottage
was
so
impersonal
that
Carol
could
never
visualize
*NL*
it
.
Nor
could
she
remember
anything
that
was
inside
it
.
But
Mrs.
Dyer
*NL*
was
personal
enough
.
With
Carol
,
Mrs.
Howland
,
Mrs.
McGanum
,
and
Vida
*NL*
Sherwin
she
was
a
link
between
the
Jolly
Seventeen
and
the
serious
*NL*
Thanatopsis
-LRB-
in
contrast
to
Juanita
Haydock
,
who
unnecessarily
boasted
*NL*
of
being
a
``
lowbrow
''
and
publicly
stated
that
she
would
``
see
herself
*NL*
in
jail
before
she
'd
write
any
darned
old
club
papers
''
-RRB-
.
Mrs.
Dyer
was
*NL*
superfeminine
in
the
kimono
in
which
she
received
Carol
.
Her
skin
was
*NL*
fine
,
pale
,
soft
,
suggesting
a
weak
voluptuousness
.
At
afternoon-coffees
*NL*
she
had
been
rude
but
now
she
addressed
Carol
as
``
dear
,
''
and
insisted
on
*NL*
being
called
Maud
.
Carol
did
not
quite
know
why
she
was
uncomfortable
*NL*
in
this
talcum-powder
atmosphere
,
but
she
hastened
to
get
into
the
fresh
*NL*
air
of
her
plans
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maud
Dyer
granted
that
the
city
hall
was
n't
``
so
very
nice
,
''
yet
,
as
Dave
*NL*
said
,
there
was
no
use
doing
anything
about
it
till
they
received
*NL*
an
appropriation
from
the
state
and
combined
a
new
city
hall
with
*NL*
a
national
guard
armory
.
Dave
had
given
verdict
,
``
What
these
mouthy
*NL*
youngsters
that
hang
around
the
pool-room
need
is
universal
military
*NL*
training
.
Make
men
of
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dyer
removed
the
new
schoolbuilding
from
the
city
hall
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
so
Mrs.
Mott
has
got
you
going
on
her
school
craze
!
She
's
been
*NL*
dinging
at
that
till
everybody
's
sick
and
tired
.
What
she
really
wants
*NL*
is
a
big
office
for
her
dear
bald-headed
Gawge
to
sit
around
and
look
*NL*
important
in
.
Of
course
I
admire
Mrs.
Mott
,
and
I
'm
very
fond
of
*NL*
her
,
she
's
so
brainy
,
even
if
she
does
try
to
butt
in
and
run
the
*NL*
Thanatopsis
,
but
I
must
say
we
're
sick
of
her
nagging
.
The
old
building
*NL*
was
good
enough
for
us
when
we
were
kids
!
I
hate
these
would-be
women
*NL*
politicians
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
week
of
March
had
given
promise
of
spring
and
stirred
Carol
*NL*
with
a
thousand
desires
for
lakes
and
fields
and
roads
.
The
snow
was
*NL*
gone
except
for
filthy
woolly
patches
under
trees
,
the
thermometer
*NL*
leaped
in
a
day
from
wind-bitten
chill
to
itchy
warmth
.
As
soon
as
Carol
*NL*
was
convinced
that
even
in
this
imprisoned
North
,
spring
could
exist
*NL*
again
,
the
snow
came
down
as
abruptly
as
a
paper
storm
in
a
theater
;
the
*NL*
northwest
gale
flung
it
up
in
a
half
blizzard
;
and
with
her
hope
of
a
*NL*
glorified
town
went
hope
of
summer
meadows
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
week
later
,
though
the
snow
was
everywhere
in
slushy
heaps
,
the
*NL*
promise
was
unmistakable
.
By
the
invisible
hints
in
air
and
sky
and
*NL*
earth
which
had
aroused
her
every
year
through
ten
thousand
generations
*NL*
she
knew
that
spring
was
coming
.
It
was
not
a
scorching
,
hard
,
dusty
day
*NL*
like
the
treacherous
intruder
of
a
week
before
,
but
soaked
with
languor
,
*NL*
softened
with
a
milky
light
.
Rivulets
were
hurrying
in
each
alley
;
a
*NL*
calling
robin
appeared
by
magic
on
the
crab-apple
tree
in
the
Howlands
'
*NL*
yard
.
Everybody
chuckled
,
``
Looks
like
winter
is
going
,
''
and
``
This
'll
*NL*
bring
the
frost
out
of
the
roads
--
have
the
autos
out
pretty
soon
*NL*
now
--
wonder
what
kind
of
bass-fishing
we
'll
get
this
summer
--
ought
to
be
*NL*
good
crops
this
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Each
evening
Kennicott
repeated
,
``
We
better
not
take
off
our
Heavy
*NL*
Underwear
or
the
storm
windows
too
soon
--
might
be
`
nother
spell
of
*NL*
cold
--
got
to
be
careful
`
bout
catching
cold
--
wonder
if
the
coal
will
*NL*
last
through
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
expanding
forces
of
life
within
her
choked
the
desire
for
reforming
.
*NL*
She
trotted
through
the
house
,
planning
the
spring
cleaning
with
Bea
.
*NL*
When
she
attended
her
second
meeting
of
the
Thanatopsis
she
said
nothing
*NL*
about
remaking
the
town
.
She
listened
respectably
to
statistics
on
*NL*
Dickens
,
Thackeray
,
Jane
Austen
,
George
Eliot
,
Scott
,
Hardy
,
Lamb
,
De
*NL*
Quincey
,
and
Mrs.
Humphry
Ward
,
who
,
it
seemed
,
constituted
the
writers
*NL*
of
English
Fiction
and
Essays
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
till
she
inspected
the
rest-room
did
she
again
become
a
fanatic
.
*NL*
She
had
often
glanced
at
the
store-building
which
had
been
turned
into
*NL*
a
refuge
in
which
farmwives
could
wait
while
their
husbands
transacted
*NL*
business
.
She
had
heard
Vida
Sherwin
and
Mrs.
Warren
caress
the
virtue
*NL*
of
the
Thanatopsis
in
establishing
the
rest-room
and
in
sharing
with
the
*NL*
city
council
the
expense
of
maintaining
it
.
But
she
had
never
entered
it
*NL*
till
this
March
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
in
impulsively
;
nodded
at
the
matron
,
a
plump
worthy
widow
*NL*
named
Nodelquist
,
and
at
a
couple
of
farm-women
who
were
meekly
rocking
.
*NL*
The
rest-room
resembled
a
second-hand
store
.
It
was
furnished
with
*NL*
discarded
patent
rockers
,
lopsided
reed
chairs
,
a
scratched
pine
table
,
*NL*
a
gritty
straw
mat
,
old
steel
engravings
of
milkmaids
being
morally
*NL*
amorous
under
willow-trees
,
faded
chromos
of
roses
and
fish
,
and
a
*NL*
kerosene
stove
for
warming
lunches
.
The
front
window
was
darkened
by
*NL*
torn
net
curtains
and
by
a
mound
of
geraniums
and
rubber-plants
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
listening
to
Mrs.
Nodelquist
's
account
of
how
many
*NL*
thousands
of
farmers
'
wives
used
the
rest-room
every
year
,
and
how
much
*NL*
they
``
appreciated
the
kindness
of
the
ladies
in
providing
them
with
*NL*
this
lovely
place
,
and
all
free
,
''
she
thought
,
``
Kindness
nothing
!
The
*NL*
kind-ladies
'
husbands
get
the
farmers
'
trade
.
This
is
mere
commercial
*NL*
accommodation
.
And
it
's
horrible
.
It
ought
to
be
the
most
charming
room
*NL*
in
town
,
to
comfort
women
sick
of
prairie
kitchens
.
Certainly
it
ought
*NL*
to
have
a
clear
window
,
so
that
they
can
see
the
metropolitan
life
go
*NL*
by
.
Some
day
I
'm
going
to
make
a
better
rest-room
--
a
club-room
.
Why
!
*NL*
I
've
already
planned
that
as
part
of
my
Georgian
town
hall
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
chanced
that
she
was
plotting
against
the
peace
of
the
Thanatopsis
*NL*
at
her
third
meeting
-LRB-
which
covered
Scandinavian
,
Russian
,
and
Polish
*NL*
Literature
,
with
remarks
by
Mrs.
Leonard
Warren
on
the
sinful
paganism
*NL*
of
the
Russian
so-called
church
-RRB-
.
Even
before
the
entrance
of
the
*NL*
coffee
and
hot
rolls
Carol
seized
on
Mrs.
Champ
Perry
,
the
kind
and
*NL*
ample-bosomed
pioneer
woman
who
gave
historic
dignity
to
the
modern
*NL*
matrons
of
the
Thanatopsis
.
She
poured
out
her
plans
.
Mrs.
Perry
nodded
*NL*
and
stroked
Carol
's
hand
,
but
at
the
end
she
sighed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
agree
with
you
,
dearie
.
I
'm
sure
you
're
one
of
the
*NL*
Lord
's
anointed
-LRB-
even
if
we
do
n't
see
you
at
the
Baptist
Church
as
often
*NL*
as
we
'd
like
to
-RRB-
!
But
I
'm
afraid
you
're
too
tender-hearted
.
When
Champ
*NL*
and
I
came
here
we
teamed-it
with
an
ox-cart
from
Sauk
Centre
to
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
,
and
there
was
nothing
here
then
but
a
stockade
and
a
few
*NL*
soldiers
and
some
log
cabins
.
When
we
wanted
salt
pork
and
gunpowder
,
we
*NL*
sent
out
a
man
on
horseback
,
and
probably
he
was
shot
dead
by
the
*NL*
Injuns
before
he
got
back
.
We
ladies
--
of
course
we
were
all
farmers
*NL*
at
first
--
we
did
n't
expect
any
rest-room
in
those
days
.
My
,
we
'd
have
*NL*
thought
the
one
they
have
now
was
simply
elegant
!
My
house
was
roofed
*NL*
with
hay
and
it
leaked
something
terrible
when
it
rained
--
only
dry
place
*NL*
was
under
a
shelf
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
when
the
town
grew
up
we
thought
the
new
city
hall
was
real
fine
.
*NL*
And
I
do
n't
see
any
need
for
dance-halls
.
Dancing
is
n't
what
it
was
,
*NL*
anyway
.
We
used
to
dance
modest
,
and
we
had
just
as
much
fun
as
all
*NL*
these
young
folks
do
now
with
their
terrible
Turkey
Trots
and
hugging
*NL*
and
all
.
But
if
they
must
neglect
the
Lord
's
injunction
that
young
girls
*NL*
ought
to
be
modest
,
then
I
guess
they
manage
pretty
well
at
the
K.
*NL*
P.
Hall
and
the
Oddfellows
'
,
even
if
some
of
tie
lodges
do
n't
always
*NL*
welcome
a
lot
of
these
foreigners
and
hired
help
to
all
their
dances
.
*NL*
And
I
certainly
do
n't
see
any
need
of
a
farm-bureau
or
this
domestic
*NL*
science
demonstration
you
talk
about
.
In
my
day
the
boys
learned
to
farm
*NL*
by
honest
sweating
,
and
every
gal
could
cook
,
or
her
ma
learned
her
*NL*
how
across
her
knee
!
Besides
,
ai
n't
there
a
county
agent
at
Wakamin
?
He
*NL*
comes
here
once
a
fortnight
,
maybe
.
That
's
enough
monkeying
with
this
*NL*
scientific
farming
--
Champ
says
there
's
nothing
to
it
anyway
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
as
for
a
lecture
hall
--
have
n't
we
got
the
churches
?
Good
deal
*NL*
better
to
listen
to
a
good
old-fashioned
sermon
than
a
lot
of
geography
*NL*
and
books
and
things
that
nobody
needs
to
know
--
more
'n
enough
heathen
*NL*
learning
right
here
in
the
Thanatopsis
.
And
as
for
trying
to
make
a
*NL*
whole
town
in
this
Colonial
architecture
you
talk
about
--
I
do
love
*NL*
nice
things
;
to
this
day
I
run
ribbons
into
my
petticoats
,
even
if
*NL*
Champ
Perry
does
laugh
at
me
,
the
old
villain
!
But
just
the
same
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
any
of
us
old-timers
would
like
to
see
the
town
that
we
worked
*NL*
so
hard
to
build
being
tore
down
to
make
a
place
that
would
n't
look
like
*NL*
nothing
but
some
Dutch
story-book
and
not
a
bit
like
the
place
we
loved
.
*NL*
And
do
n't
you
think
it
's
sweet
now
?
All
the
trees
and
lawns
?
And
such
*NL*
comfy
houses
,
and
hot-water
heat
and
electric
lights
and
telephones
*NL*
and
cement
walks
and
everything
?
Why
,
I
thought
everybody
from
the
Twin
*NL*
Cities
always
said
it
was
such
a
beautiful
town
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
forswore
herself
;
declared
that
Gopher
Prairie
had
the
color
of
*NL*
Algiers
and
the
gaiety
of
Mardi
Gras
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
the
next
afternoon
she
was
pouncing
on
Mrs.
Lyman
Cass
,
the
*NL*
hook-nosed
consort
of
the
owner
of
the
flour-mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Cass
's
parlor
belonged
to
the
crammed-Victorian
school
,
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Luke
Dawson
's
belonged
to
the
bare-Victorian
.
It
was
furnished
on
two
*NL*
principles
:
First
,
everything
must
resemble
something
else
.
A
rocker
had
*NL*
a
back
like
a
lyre
,
a
near-leather
seat
imitating
tufted
cloth
,
and
*NL*
arms
like
Scotch
Presbyterian
lions
;
with
knobs
,
scrolls
,
shields
,
and
*NL*
spear-points
on
unexpected
portions
of
the
chair
.
The
second
principle
*NL*
of
the
crammed-Victorian
school
was
that
every
inch
of
the
interior
must
*NL*
be
filled
with
useless
objects
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
walls
of
Mrs.
Cass
's
parlor
were
plastered
with
``
hand-painted
''
*NL*
pictures
,
``
buckeye
''
pictures
,
of
birch-trees
,
news-boys
,
puppies
,
and
*NL*
church-steeples
on
Christmas
Eve
;
with
a
plaque
depicting
the
Exposition
*NL*
Building
in
Minneapolis
,
burnt-wood
portraits
of
Indian
chiefs
of
no
*NL*
tribe
in
particular
,
a
pansy-decked
poetic
motto
,

Mrs.

's
first
remark
was
,
``
I
must
show
you
all
my
pretty

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
piped
,
after
Carol
's
appeal
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
see
.
You
think
the
New
England
villages
and
Colonial
houses
are
so
*NL*
much
more
cunning
than
these

towns

I
'm
glad
you
feel
that

way

You
'll
be
interested
to
know
I
was
born
in
Vermont

And
do

make
Gopher

My
gracious
no

We
ca
n't
afford
it

high

We
ought
to
retrench

not
let

spend
another

Uh

Do
n't
you
think
that
was
a
grand
paper
Mrs.
Westlake
read
about
*NL*
Tolstoy
?
I
was
so
glad
she
pointed
out
how
all
his
silly
socialistic
*NL*
ideas
failed

''
*NL*
*NL*
What
Mrs.
Cass
said
was
what
Kennicott
said
,
that
evening
.
Not
in
twenty
*NL*
years
would
the
council
propose
or
Gopher
Prairie
vote
the
funds
for
a
*NL*
new
city
hall
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
avoided
exposing
her
plans
to
Vida
Sherwin
.
She
was
shy
of
the
*NL*
big-sister
manner
;
Vida
would
either
laugh
at
her
or
snatch
the
idea
and
*NL*
change
it
to
suit
herself
.
But
there
was
no
other
hope
.
When
Vida
came
*NL*
in
to
tea
Carol
sketched
her
Utopia
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
was
soothing
but
decisive
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
you
're
all
off
.
I
would
like
to
see
it
:
a
real
gardeny
place
*NL*
to
shut
out
the
gales
.
But
it
ca
n't
be
done
.
What
could
the
clubwomen
*NL*
accomplish
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
husbands
are
the
most
important

They
ARE

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
the
town
as
a
separate
unit

not
the

Thanatopsis

If
you
knew
the
trouble
we
had
in
getting
the
city
council
to
spend
the
*NL*
money
and
cover
the
pumping-station
with
vines
!
Whatever
you
may
think
*NL*
of
Gopher

women
,
they
're
twice
as
progressive
as

the

see
the
ugliness

``
They
do

think
it
's
ugly

And
how
can
you
prove
it

of
taste

Why
should
they
like
what
a

likes

What
they
like

Well

why
not

Anyway

the
point
is
that
you
have

inside

what
we
have

rather
than
from

outside

foreign

bright

has
to
grow
out
of

express
it

means

waiting

we
keep
after

ten

they
fear
more

that

VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Early
May
;
wheat
springing
up
in
blades
like
grass
;
corn
and
potatoes
*NL*
being
planted
;
the
land
humming
.
For
two
days
there
had
been
steady
*NL*
rain
.
Even
in
town
the
roads
were
a
furrowed
welter
of
mud
,
hideous
to
*NL*
view
and
difficult
to
cross
.
Main
Street
was
a
black
swamp
from
curb
to
*NL*
curb
;
on
residence
streets
the
grass
parking
beside
the
walks
oozed
gray
*NL*
water
.
It
was
prickly
hot
,
yet
the
town
was
barren
under
the
bleak
sky
.
*NL*
Softened
neither
by
snow
nor
by
waving
boughs
the
houses
squatted
and
*NL*
scowled
,
revealed
in
their
unkempt
harshness
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
dragged
homeward
Carol
looked
with
distaste
at
her
clay-loaded
*NL*
rubbers
,
the
smeared
hem
of
her
skirt
.
She
passed
Lyman
Cass
's
*NL*
pinnacled
,
dark-red
,
hulking
house
.
She
waded
a
streaky
yellow
pool
.
*NL*
This
morass
was
not
her
home
,
she
insisted
.
Her
home
,
and
her
beautiful
*NL*
town
,
existed
in
her
mind
.
They
had
already
been
created
.
The
task
was
*NL*
done
.
What
she
really
had
been
questing
was
some
one
to
share
them
with
*NL*
her
.
Vida
would
not
;
Kennicott
could
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Some
one
to
share
her
refuge
.
*NL*
*NL*
Suddenly
she
was
thinking
of
Guy
Pollock
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
dismissed
him
.
He
was
too
cautious
.
She
needed
a
spirit
as
young
and
*NL*
unreasonable
as
her
own
.
And
she
would
never
find
it
.
Youth
would
never
*NL*
come
singing
.
She
was
beaten
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
that
same
evening
she
had
an
idea
which
solved
the
rebuilding
of
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Within
ten
minutes
she
was
jerking
the
old-fashioned
bell-pull
of
Luke
*NL*
Dawson
.
Mrs.
Dawson
opened
the
door
and
peered
doubtfully
about
the
*NL*
edge
of
it
.
Carol
kissed
her
cheek
,
and
frisked
into
the
lugubrious
*NL*
sitting-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
you
're
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
!
''
chuckled
Mr.
Dawson
,
*NL*
dropping
his
newspaper
,
pushing
his
spectacles
back
on
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
seem
so
excited
,
''
sighed
Mrs.
Dawson
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
!
Mr.
Dawson
,
are
n't
you
a
millionaire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
cocked
his
head
,
and
purred
,
``
Well
,
I
guess
if
I
cashed
in
on
all
my
*NL*
securities
and
farm-holdings
and
my
interests
in
iron
on
the
Mesaba
and
*NL*
in
Northern
timber
and
cut-over
lands
,
I
could
push
two
million
dollars
*NL*
pretty
close
,
and
I
've
made
every
cent
of
it
by
hard
work
and
having
the
*NL*
sense
to
not
go
out
and
spend
every

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
want
most
of
it
from

*NL*
*NL*
The
Dawsons
glanced
at
each
other
in
appreciation
of
the
jest
;
and
*NL*
he
chirped
,
``
You
're
worse
than
Reverend
Benlick

He
do
n't
hardly
ever

strike
me
for
more
than
ten
dollars

at
a
time

*NL*
``
I
'm
not
joking

children

are
grown-up
and
*NL*
well-to-do
.
You
do
n't
want
to
die
and
leave
your
name
unknown
.
Why
not
*NL*
do
a
big
,
original
thing
?
Why
not
rebuild
the
whole
town
?
Get
a
great
*NL*
architect
,
and
have
him
plan
a
town
that
would
be
suitable
to
the
*NL*
prairie
.
Perhaps
he
'd
create
some
entirely
new
form
of
architecture

Then
tear
down
all
these
shambling
buildings

*NL*
Mr.
Dawson
had
decided
that
she
really
did
mean
it

He
wailed
,
``
Why

*NL*
that
would
cost
at
least
three
or
four
million
dollars

*NL*
*NL*

cash

``

had
met

For

muddy

seemed
nearer

credulous
youth

she
was

seeking

fight
beside

told

little
of

had
changed
from

She
forgot
him

tramped
the

She
had
replaced

project

of

She
was
ever
so
correct

modern

She
did
not

she
said
,
*NL*
want
charity
for
them
,
but
a
chance
of
self-help
;
an
employment
bureau
,
*NL*
direction
in
washing
babies
and
making
pleasing
stews
,
possibly
a

municipal
fund
for
home-building

What
do
you
think
of
my
plans

Mrs.

concluded

*NL*
Speaking
judiciously
,
as
one
related
to

church
by
marriage

Mrs.

Warren
gave
verdict
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
we
're
all
heartily
in
accord

feeling

that
wherever
genuine
poverty
is
encountered
,
it
is
not
only
noblesse
*NL*
oblige
but
a
joy
to
fulfil
our
duty
to
the
less
fortunate
ones
.
But
I
*NL*
must
say
it
seems
to
me
we
should
lose
the
whole
point
of
the
thing
by
*NL*
not
regarding
it
as
charity
.
Why
,
that
's
the
chief
adornment
of
the
true
*NL*
Christian
and
the
church

The
Bible
has
laid
it
down
for
our
guidance

`
Faith

Hope

and
CHARITY

it
says
,
and
,
`
The
poor
ye
have
with
ye
*NL*
always

which
indicates
that
there
never
can
be
anything
to
these

so-called
scientific

abolishing
charity

never

it
*NL*
better
so
?
I
should
hate
to
think
of
a
world
in
which
we
were
deprived
*NL*
of
all
the
pleasure
of
giving
.
Besides
,
if
these
shiftless
folks
realize
*NL*
they
're
getting
charity
,
and
not
something
to
which
they
have
a
right
,
*NL*
they
're
so
much
more
grateful
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Besides
,
''
snorted
Miss
Ella
Stowbody
,
``
they
've
been
fooling
you
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
.
There
is
n't
any
real
poverty
here
.
Take
that
Mrs.
Steinhof
*NL*
you
speak
of
:
I
send
her
our
washing
whenever
there
's
too
much
for
our
*NL*
hired
girl
--
I
must
have
sent
her
ten
dollars
'
worth
the
past
year
alone
!
*NL*
I
'm
sure
Papa
would
never
approve
of
a
city
home-building
fund
.
Papa
*NL*
says
these
folks
are
fakers
.
Especially
all
these
tenant
farmers
that
*NL*
pretend
they
have
so
much
trouble
getting
seed
and
machinery
.
Papa
*NL*
says
they
simply
wo
n't
pay
their
debts
.
He
says
he
's
sure
he
hates
to
*NL*
foreclose
mortgages
,
but
it
's
the
only
way
to
make
them
respect
the
*NL*
law
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
then
think
of
all
the
clothes
we
give
these
people
!
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Jackson
Elder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
intruded
again
.
``
Oh
yes
.
The
clothes
.
I
was
going
to
speak
of
*NL*
that
.
Do
n't
you
think
that
when
we
give
clothes
to
the
poor
,
if
we
*NL*
do
give
them
old
ones
,
we
ought
to
mend
them
first
and
make
them
as
*NL*
presentable
as
we
can
?
Next
Christmas
when
the
Thanatopsis
makes
its
*NL*
distribution
,
would
n't
it
be
jolly
if
we
got
together
and
sewed
on
the
*NL*
clothes
,
and
trimmed
hats
,
and
made
them
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heavens
and
earth
,
they
have
more
time
than
we
have
!
They
ought
to
be
*NL*
mighty
good
and
grateful
to
get
anything
,
no
matter
what
shape
it
's
in
.
*NL*
I
know
I
'm
not
going
to
sit
and
sew
for
that
lazy
Mrs.
Vopni
,
with
all
*NL*
I
've
got
to
do
!
''
snapped
Ella
Stowbody
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
glaring
at
Carol
.
She
reflected
that
Mrs.
Vopni
,
whose
husband
*NL*
had
been
killed
by
a
train
,
had
ten
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Mrs.
Mary
Ellen
Wilks
was
smiling
.
Mrs.
Wilks
was
the
proprietor
of
*NL*
Ye
Art
Shoppe
and
Magazine
and
Book
Store
,
and
the
reader
of
the
small
*NL*
Christian
Science
church
.
She
made
it
all
clear
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
this
class
of
people
had
an
understanding
of
Science
and
that
we
are
*NL*
the
children
of
God
and
nothing
can
harm
us
,
they
would
n't
be
in
error
*NL*
and
poverty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Jackson
Elder
confirmed
,
``
Besides
,
it
strikes
me
the
club
is
*NL*
already
doing
enough
,
with
tree-planting
and
the
anti-fly
campaign
and
*NL*
the
responsibility
for
the
rest-room
--
to
say
nothing
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
we
've
talked
of
trying
to
get
the
railroad
to
put
in
a
park
at
the
*NL*
station
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
so
too
!
''
said
Madam
Chairman
.
She
glanced
uneasily
at
Miss
*NL*
Sherwin
.
``
But
what
do
you
think
,
Vida
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
smiled
tactfully
at
each
of
the
committee
,
and
announced
,
``
Well
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
believe
we
'd
better
start
anything
more
right
now
.
But
it
's
been
*NL*
a
privilege
to
hear
Carol
's
dear
generous
ideas
,
has
n't
it
!
Oh
!
There
is
*NL*
one
thing
we
must
decide
on
at
once
.
We
must
get
together
and
oppose
*NL*
any
move
on
the
part
of
the
Minneapolis
clubs
to
elect
another
State
*NL*
Federation
president
from
the
Twin
Cities
.
And
this
Mrs.
Edgar
Potbury
*NL*
they
're
putting
forward
--
I
know
there
are
people
who
think
she
's
a
*NL*
bright
interesting
speaker
,
but
I
regard
her
as
very
shallow
.
What
do
*NL*
you
say
to
my
writing
to
the
Lake
Ojibawasha
Club
,
telling
them
that
if
*NL*
their
district
will
support
Mrs.
Warren
for
second
vice-president
,
we
'll
*NL*
support
their
Mrs.
Hagelton
-LRB-
and
such
a
dear
,
lovely
,
cultivated
woman
,
*NL*
too
-RRB-
for
president
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
We
ought
to
show
up
those
Minneapolis
folks
!
''
Ella
Stowbody
*NL*
said
acidly
.
``
And
oh
,
by
the
way
,
we
must
oppose
this
movement
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Potbury
's
to
have
the
state
clubs
come
out
definitely
in
favor
of
woman
*NL*
suffrage
.
Women
have
n't
any
place
in
politics
.
They
would
lose
all
their
*NL*
daintiness
and
charm
if
they
became
involved
in
these
horried
plots
*NL*
and
log-rolling
and
all
this
awful
political
stuff
about
scandal
and
*NL*
personalities
and
so
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
--
save
one
--
nodded
.
They
interrupted
the
formal
business-meeting
*NL*
to
discuss
Mrs.
Edgar
Potbury
's
husband
,
Mrs.
Potbury
's
income
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Potbury
's
sedan
,
Mrs.
Potbury
's
residence
,
Mrs.
Potbury
's
oratorical
*NL*
style
,
Mrs.
Potbury
's
mandarin
evening
coat
,
Mrs.
Potbury
's
coiffure
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Potbury
's
altogether
reprehensible
influence
on
the
State
*NL*
Federation
of
Women
's
Clubs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
program
committee
adjourned
they
took
three
minutes
to
*NL*
decide
which
of
the
subjects
suggested
by
the
magazine
Culture
Hints
,
*NL*
Furnishings
and
China
,
or
The
Bible
as
Literature
,
would
be
better
for
*NL*
the
coming
year
.
There
was
one
annoying
incident
.
Mrs.
Dr.
Kennicott
*NL*
interfered
and
showed
off
again
.
She
commented
,
``
Do
n't
you
think
that
we
*NL*
already
get
enough
of
the
Bible
in
our
churches
and
Sunday
Schools
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Leonard
Warren
,
somewhat
out
of
order
but
much
more
out
of
temper
,
*NL*
cried
,
``
Well
upon
my
word
!
I
did
n't
suppose
there
was
any
one
who
felt
*NL*
that
we
could
get
enough
of
the
Bible
!
I
guess
if
the
Grand
Old
Book
*NL*
has
withstood
the
attacks
of
infidels
for
these
two
thousand
years
it
is
*NL*
worth
our
SLIGHT
consideration
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
I
did
n't
mean
--
''
Carol
begged
.
Inasmuch
as
she
did
mean
,
it
was
*NL*
hard
to
be
extremely
lucid
.
``
But
I
wish
,
instead
of
limiting
ourselves
*NL*
either
to
the
Bible
,
or
to
anecdotes
about
the
Brothers
Adam
's
wigs
,
*NL*
which
Culture
Hints
seems
to
regard
as
the
significant
point
about
*NL*
furniture
,
we
could
study
some
of
the
really
stirring
ideas
that
are
*NL*
springing
up
today
--
whether
it
's
chemistry
or
anthropology
or
labor
*NL*
problems
--
the
things
that
are
going
to
mean
so
terribly
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
cleared
her
polite
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Madam
Chairman
inquired
,
``
Is
there
any
other
discussion
?
Will
some
*NL*
one
make
a
motion
to
adopt
the
suggestion
of
Vida
Sherwin
--
to
take
up
*NL*
Furnishings
and
China
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
adopted
,
unanimously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Checkmate
!
''
murmured
Carol
,
as
she
held
up
her
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
she
actually
believed
that
she
could
plant
a
seed
of
liberalism
*NL*
in
the
blank
wall
of
mediocrity
?
How
had
she
fallen
into
the
folly
of
*NL*
trying
to
plant
anything
whatever
in
a
wall
so
smooth
and
sun-glazed
,
*NL*
and
so
satisfying
to
the
happy
sleepers
within
?

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
ONE
week
of
authentic
spring
,
one
rare
sweet
week
of
May
,
one
tranquil
*NL*
moment
between
the
blast
of
winter
and
the
charge
of
summer
.
Daily
Carol
*NL*
walked
from
town
into
flashing
country
hysteric
with
new
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
enchanted
hour
when
she
returned
to
youth
and
a
belief
in
the
*NL*
possibility
of
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
walked
northward
toward
the
upper
shore
of
Plover
Lake
,
taking
*NL*
to
the
railroad
track
,
whose
directness
and
dryness
make
it
the
natural
*NL*
highway
for
pedestrians
on
the
plains
.
She
stepped
from
tie
to
tie
,
in
*NL*
long
strides
.
At
each
road-crossing
she
had
to
crawl
over
a
cattle-guard
*NL*
of
sharpened
timbers
.
She
walked
the
rails
,
balancing
with
arms
*NL*
extended
,
cautious
heel
before
toe
.
As
she
lost
balance
her
body
bent
*NL*
over
,
her
arms
revolved
wildly
,
and
when
she
toppled
she
laughed
aloud
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
thick
grass
beside
the
track
,
coarse
and
prickly
with
many
burnings
,
*NL*
hid
canary-yellow
buttercups
and
the
mauve
petals
and
woolly
sage-green
*NL*
coats
of
the
pasque
flowers
.
The
branches
of
the
kinnikinic
brush
were
*NL*
red
and
smooth
as
lacquer
on
a
saki
bowl
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
down
the
gravelly
embankment
,
smiled
at
children
gathering
*NL*
flowers
in
a
little
basket
,
thrust
a
handful
of
the
soft
pasque
flowers
*NL*
into
the
bosom
of
her
white
blouse
.
Fields
of
springing
wheat
drew
her
*NL*
from
the
straight
propriety
of
the
railroad
and
she
crawled
through
the
*NL*
rusty
barbed-wire
fence
.
She
followed
a
furrow
between
low
wheat
blades
*NL*
and
a
field
of
rye
which
showed
silver
lights
as
it
flowed
before
the
*NL*
wind
.
She
found
a
pasture
by
the
lake
.
So
sprinkled
was
the
pasture
with
*NL*
rag-baby
blossoms
and
the
cottony
herb
of
Indian
tobacco
that
it
spread
*NL*
out
like
a
rare
old
Persian
carpet
of
cream
and
rose
and
delicate
green
.
*NL*
Under
her
feet
the
rough
grass
made
a
pleasant
crunching
.
Sweet
winds
*NL*
blew
from
the
sunny
lake
beside
her
,
and
small
waves
sputtered
on
the
*NL*
meadowy
shore
.
She
leaped
a
tiny
creek
bowered
in
pussy-willow
buds
.
She
*NL*
was
nearing
a
frivolous
grove
of
birch
and
poplar
and
wild
plum
trees
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
poplar
foliage
had
the
downiness
of
a
Corot
arbor
;
the
green
and
*NL*
silver
trunks
were
as
candid
as
the
birches
,
as
slender
and
lustrous
*NL*
as
the
limbs
of
a
Pierrot
.
The
cloudy
white
blossoms
of
the
plum
trees
*NL*
filled
the
grove
with
a
springtime
mistiness
which
gave
an
illusion
of
*NL*
distance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
into
the
wood
,
crying
out
for
joy
of
freedom
regained
after
*NL*
winter
.
Choke-cherry
blossoms
lured
her
from
the
outer
sun-warmed
spaces
*NL*
to
depths
of
green
stillness
,
where
a
submarine
light
came
through
the
*NL*
young
leaves
.
She
walked
pensively
along
an
abandoned
road
.
She
found
a
*NL*
moccasin-flower
beside
a
lichen-covered
log
.
At
the
end
of
the
road
she
*NL*
saw
the
open
acres
--
dipping
rolling
fields
bright
with
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
!
The
woodland
gods
still
live
!
And
out
there
,
the
great
land
.
*NL*
It
's
beautiful
as
the
mountains
.
What
do
I
care
for
Thanatopsises
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
out
on
the
prairie
,
spacious
under
an
arch
of
boldly
cut
*NL*
clouds
.
Small
pools
glittered
.
Above
a
marsh
red-winged
blackbirds
*NL*
chased
a
crow
in
a
swift
melodrama
of
the
air
.
On
a
hill
was
silhouetted
*NL*
a
man
following
a
drag
.
His
horse
bent
its
neck
and
plodded
,
content
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
path
took
her
to
the
Corinth
road
,
leading
back
to
town
.
Dandelions
*NL*
glowed
in
patches
amidst
the
wild
grass
by
the
way
.
A
stream
golloped
*NL*
through
a
concrete
culvert
beneath
the
road
.
She
trudged
in
healthy
*NL*
weariness
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
man
in
a
bumping
Ford
rattled
up
beside
her
,
hailed
,
``
Give
you
a
lift
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Kennicott
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
.
It
's
awfully
good
of
you
,
but
I
'm
enjoying
the
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Great
day
,
by
golly
.
I
seen
some
wheat
that
must
of
been
five
inches
*NL*
high
.
Well
,
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
n't
the
dimmest
notion
who
he
was
,
but
his
greeting
warmed
her
.
*NL*
This
countryman
gave
her
a
companionship
which
she
had
never
-LRB-
whether
*NL*
by
her
fault
or
theirs
or
neither
-RRB-
been
able
to
find
in
the
matrons
and
*NL*
commercial
lords
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
a
mile
from
town
,
in
a
hollow
between
hazelnut
bushes
and
a
brook
,
*NL*
she
discovered
a
gipsy
encampment
:
a
covered
wagon
,
a
tent
,
a
bunch
of
*NL*
pegged-out
horses
.
A
broad-shouldered
man
was
squatted
on
his
heels
,
*NL*
holding
a
frying-pan
over
a
camp-fire
.
He
looked
toward
her
.
He
was
*NL*
Miles
Bjornstam
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
what
you
doing
out
here
?
''
he
roared
.
``
Come
have
a
hunk
o
'
*NL*
bacon
.
Pete
!
Hey
,
Pete
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
tousled
person
came
from
behind
the
covered
wagon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pete
,
here
's
the
one
honest-to-God
lady
in
my
bum
town

Come
on

crawl
*NL*
in
and
set
a
couple
minutes
,
Mrs.
Kennicott
.
I
'm
hiking
off
for
all
*NL*
summer

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Red
Swede
staggered
up
,
rubbed
his
cramped
knees
,
lumbered
to
the
*NL*
wire
fence
,
held
the
strands
apart
for
her
.
She
unconsciously
smiled
at
*NL*
him
as
she
went
through
.
Her
skirt
caught
on
a
barb
;
he
carefully
freed
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Beside
this
man
in
blue
flannel
shirt
,
baggy
khaki
trousers
,
uneven
*NL*
suspenders
,
and
vile
felt
hat
,
she
was
small
and
exquisite
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
surly
Pete
set
out
an
upturned
bucket
for
her
.
She
lounged
on
it
,
*NL*
her
elbows
on
her
knees
.
``
Where
are

she
asked
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
starting
off
for
the
summer

horse-trading

Bjornstam
chuckled
.
*NL*
His
red
mustache
caught
the
sun
.
``
Regular

We
're
honest
--
frequently
.
*NL*
Great
time
.
Camp
along
the
road
.
I
was
wishing
I
had
a
chance
to
say
*NL*
good-by
to
you
before
I
ducked
out
but
--
Say
,
you
better
come
along
*NL*
with
us

While
you
're
playing

Dakota

through
the
Bad
Lands

into

when
fall
comes

we
'll
be

up

Then
in

snug

look
up

*NL*
*NL*
Her
hand
disappeared
in
his
blackened
leather
glove
.
From
the
turn
in
*NL*
the
road
she
waved
at
him
.
She
walked
on
more
soberly
now
,
and
she
was
*NL*
lonely
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
wheat
and
grass
were
sleek
velvet
under
the
sunset
;
the
prairie
*NL*
clouds
were
tawny
gold
;
and
she
swung
happily
into
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
first
days
of
June
she
drove
with
Kennicott
on
his
calls
.
*NL*
She
identified
him
with
the
virile
land
;
she
admired
him
as
she
saw
with
*NL*
what
respect
the
farmers
obeyed
him
.
She
was
out
in
the
early
chill
,
*NL*
after
a
hasty
cup
of
coffee
,
reaching
open
country
as
the
fresh
sun
came
*NL*
up
in
that
unspoiled
world
.
Meadow
larks
called
from
the
tops
of
thin
*NL*
split
fence-posts
.
The
wild
roses
smelled
clean
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
returned
in
late
afternoon
the
low
sun
was
a
solemnity
of
radial
*NL*
bands
,
like
a
heavenly
fan
of
beaten
gold
;
the
limitless
circle
of
the
*NL*
grain
was
a
green
sea
rimmed
with
fog
,
and
the
willow
wind-breaks
were
*NL*
palmy
isles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
July
the
close
heat
blanketed
them
.
The
tortured
earth
cracked
.
*NL*
Farmers
panted
through
corn-fields
behind
cultivators
and
the
sweating
*NL*
flanks
of
horses
.
While
she
waited
for
Kennicott
in
the
car
,
before
a
*NL*
farmhouse
,
the
seat
burned
her
fingers
and
her
head
ached
with
the
glare
*NL*
on
fenders
and
hood
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
black
thunder-shower
was
followed
by
a
dust
storm
which
turned
the
*NL*
sky
yellow
with
the
hint
of
a
coming
tornado
.
Impalpable
black
dust
*NL*
far-borne
from
Dakota
covered
the
inner
sills
of
the
closed
windows
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
July
heat
was
ever
more
stifling
.
They
crawled
along
Main
Street
by
*NL*
day
;
they
found
it
hard
to
sleep
at
night
.
They
brought
mattresses
down
*NL*
to
the
living-room
,
and
thrashed
and
turned
by
the
open
window
.
Ten
*NL*
times
a
night
they
talked
of
going
out
to
soak
themselves
with
the
*NL*
hose
and
wade
through
the
dew
,
but
they
were
too
listless
to
take
the
*NL*
trouble
.
On
cool
evenings
,
when
they
tried
to
go
walking
,
the
gnats
*NL*
appeared
in
swarms
which
peppered
their
faces
and
caught
in
their
*NL*
throats
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
the
Northern
pines
,
the
Eastern
sea
,
but
Kennicott
declared
*NL*
that
it
would
be
``
kind
of
hard
to
get
away
,
just
NOW
.
''
The
Health
and
*NL*
Improvement
Committee
of
the
Thanatopsis
asked
her
to
take
part
in
the
*NL*
anti-fly
campaign
,
and
she
toiled
about
town
persuading
householders
to
*NL*
use
the
fly-traps
furnished
by
the
club
,
or
giving
out
money
prizes
to
*NL*
fly-swatting
children
.
She
was
loyal
enough
but
not
ardent
,
and
without
*NL*
ever
quite
intending
to
,
she
began
to
neglect
the
task
as
heat
sucked
at
*NL*
her
strength
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
and
she
motored
North
and
spent
a
week
with
his
mother
--
that
*NL*
is
,
Carol
spent
it
with
his
mother
,
while
he
fished
for
bass
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
great
event
was
their
purchase
of
a
summer
cottage
,
down
on
Lake
*NL*
Minniemashie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Perhaps
the
most
amiable
feature
of
life
in
Gopher
Prairie
was
the
*NL*
summer
cottages
.
They
were
merely
two-room
shanties
,
with
a
seepage
of
*NL*
broken-down
chairs
,
peeling
veneered
tables
,
chromos
pasted
on
wooden
*NL*
walls
,
and
inefficient
kerosene
stoves
.
They
were
so
thin-walled
and
so
*NL*
close
together
that
you
could
--
and
did
--
hear
a
baby
being
spanked
in
the
*NL*
fifth
cottage
off
.
But
they
were
set
among
elms
and
lindens
on
a
bluff
*NL*
which
looked
across
the
lake
to
fields
of
ripened
wheat
sloping
up
to
*NL*
green
woods
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
the
matrons
forgot
social
jealousies
,
and
sat
gossiping
in
gingham
;
*NL*
or
,
in
old
bathing-suits
,
surrounded
by
hysterical
children
,
they
*NL*
paddled
for
hours
.
Carol
joined
them
;
she
ducked
shrieking
small
boys
,
*NL*
and
helped
babies
construct
sand-basins
for
unfortunate
minnows
.
*NL*
She
liked
Juanita
Haydock
and
Maud
Dyer
when
she
helped
them
make
*NL*
picnic-supper
for
the
men
,
who
came
motoring
out
from
town
each
evening
.
*NL*
She
was
easier
and
more
natural
with
them
.
In
the
debate
as
to
whether
*NL*
there
should
be
veal
loaf
or
poached
egg
on
hash
,
she
had
no
chance
to
*NL*
be
heretical
and
oversensitive
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
danced
sometimes
,
in
the
evening
;
they
had
a
minstrel
show
,
with
*NL*
Kennicott
surprisingly
good
as
end-man
;
always
they
were
encircled
by
*NL*
children
wise
in
the
lore
of
woodchucks
and
gophers
and
rafts
and
willow
*NL*
whistles
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
they
could
have
continued
this
normal
barbaric
life
Carol
would
have
*NL*
been
the
most
enthusiastic
citizen
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
was
relieved
*NL*
to
be
assured
that
she
did
not
want
bookish
conversation
alone
;
that
she
*NL*
did
not
expect
the
town
to
become
a
Bohemia
.
She
was
content
now
.
She
*NL*
did
not
criticize
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
in
September
,
when
the
year
was
at
its
richest
,
custom
dictated
that
*NL*
it
was
time
to
return
to
town
;
to
remove
the
children
from
the
waste
*NL*
occupation
of
learning
the
earth
,
and
send
them
back
to
lessons
about
*NL*
the
number
of
potatoes
which
-LRB-
in
a
delightful
world
untroubled
by
*NL*
commission-houses
or
shortages
in
freight-cars
-RRB-
William
sold
to
John
.
*NL*
The
women
who
had
cheerfully
gone
bathing
all
summer
looked
doubtful
*NL*
when
Carol
begged
,
``
Let
's
keep
up
an
outdoor
life
this
winter
,
let
's
*NL*
slide
and
skate
.
''
Their
hearts
shut
again
till
spring
,
and
the
nine
*NL*
months
of
cliques
and
radiators
and
dainty
refreshments
began
all
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
started
a
salon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Since
Kennicott
,
Vida
Sherwin
,
and
Guy
Pollock
were
her
only
lions
,
*NL*
and
since
Kennicott
would
have
preferred
Sam
Clark
to
all
the
poets
and
*NL*
radicals
in
the
entire
world
,
her
private
and
self-defensive
clique
did
*NL*
not
get
beyond
one
evening
dinner
for
Vida
and
Guy
,
on
her
first
wedding
*NL*
anniversary
;
and
that
dinner
did
not
get
beyond
a
controversy
regarding
*NL*
Raymie
Wutherspoon
's
yearnings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
Pollock
was
the
gentlest
person
she
had
found
here
.
He
spoke
of
her
*NL*
new
jade
and
cream
frock
naturally
,
not
jocosely
;
he
held
her
chair
*NL*
for
her
as
they
sat
down
to
dinner
;
and
he
did
not
,
like
Kennicott
,
*NL*
interrupt
her
to
shout
,
``
Oh
say
,
speaking
of
that
,
I
heard
a
good
story
*NL*
today
.
''
But
Guy
was
incurably
hermit
.
He
sat
late
and
talked
hard
,
and
*NL*
did
not
come
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
met
Champ
Perry
in
the
post-office
--
and
decided
that
in
the
*NL*
history
of
the
pioneers
was
the
panacea
for
Gopher
Prairie
,
for
all
*NL*
of
America
.
We
have
lost
their
sturdiness
,
she
told
herself
.
We
must
*NL*
restore
the
last
of
the
veterans
to
power
and
follow
them
on
the
*NL*
backward
path
to
the
integrity
of
Lincoln
,
to
the
gaiety
of
settlers
*NL*
dancing
in
a
saw-mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
in
the
records
of
the
Minnesota
Territorial
Pioneers
that
only
*NL*
sixty
years
ago
,
not
so
far
back
as
the
birth
of
her
own
father
,
four
*NL*
cabins
had
composed
Gopher
Prairie
.
The
log
stockade
which
Mrs.
Champ
*NL*
Perry
was
to
find
when
she
trekked
in
was
built
afterward
by
the
*NL*
soldiers
as
a
defense
against
the
Sioux
.
The
four
cabins
were
inhabited
*NL*
by
Maine
Yankees
who
had
come
up
the
Mississippi
to
St.
Paul
and
driven
*NL*
north
over
virgin
prairie
into
virgin
woods
.
They
ground
their
own
*NL*
corn
;
the
men-folks
shot
ducks
and
pigeons
and
prairie
chickens
;
the
*NL*
new
breakings
yielded
the
turnip-like
rutabagas
,
which
they
ate
raw
*NL*
and
boiled
and
baked
and
raw
again
.
For
treat
they
had
wild
plums
and
*NL*
crab-apples
and
tiny
wild
strawberries
.
*NL*
*NL*
Grasshoppers
came
darkening
the
sky
,
and
in
an
hour
ate
the
farmwife
's
*NL*
garden
and
the
farmer
's
coat
.
Precious
horses
painfully
brought
from
*NL*
Illinois
,
were
drowned
in
bogs
or
stampeded
by
the
fear
of
blizzards
.
*NL*
Snow
blew
through
the
chinks
of
new-made
cabins
,
and
Eastern
children
,
*NL*
with
flowery
muslin
dresses
,
shivered
all
winter
and
in
summer
were
red
*NL*
and
black
with
mosquito
bites
.
Indians
were
everywhere
;
they
camped
in
*NL*
dooryards
,
stalked
into
kitchens
to
demand
doughnuts
,
came
with
rifles
*NL*
across
their
backs
into
schoolhouses
and
begged
to
see
the
pictures
*NL*
in
the
geographies
.
Packs
of
timber-wolves
treed
the
children
;
and
the
*NL*
settlers
found
dens
of
rattle-snakes
,
killed
fifty
,
a
hundred
,
in
a
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
it
was
a
buoyant
life
.
Carol
read
enviously
in
the
admirable
*NL*
Minnesota
chronicles
called
``
Old
Rail
Fence
Corners
''
the
reminiscence
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Mahlon
Black
,
who
settled
in
Stillwater
in
1848
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
nothing
to
parade
over
in
those
days
.
We
took
it
as
it
came
*NL*
and
had
happy
lives
...
We
would
all
gather
together
and
in
about
two
*NL*
minutes
would
be
having
a
good
time
--
playing
cards
or
dancing
...
We
*NL*
used
to
waltz
and
dance
contra
dances
.
None
of
these
new
jigs
and
not
*NL*
wear
any
clothes
to
speak
of
.
We
covered
our
hides
in
those
days
;
no
*NL*
tight
skirts
like
now
.
You
could
take
three
or
four
steps
inside
our
*NL*
skirts
and
then
not
reach
the
edge
.
One
of
the
boys
would
fiddle
a
while
*NL*
and
then
some
one
would
spell
him
and
he
could
get
a
dance
.
Sometimes
*NL*
they
would
dance
and
fiddle
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reflected
that
if
she
could
not
have
ballrooms
of
gray
and
rose
*NL*
and
crystal
,
she
wanted
to
be
swinging
across
a
puncheon-floor
with
a
*NL*
dancing
fiddler
.
This
smug
in-between
town
,
which
had
exchanged
``
Money
*NL*
Musk
''
for
phonographs
grinding
out
ragtime
,
it
was
neither
the
heroic
*NL*
old
nor
the
sophisticated
new
.
Could
n't
she
somehow
,
some
yet
unimagined
*NL*
how
,
turn
it
back
to
simplicity
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
herself
knew
two
of
the
pioneers
:
the
Perrys
.
Champ
Perry
was
the
*NL*
buyer
at
the
grain-elevator
.
He
weighed
wagons
of
wheat
on
a
rough
*NL*
platform-scale
,
in
the
cracks
of
which
the
kernels
sprouted
every
*NL*
spring
.
Between
times
he
napped
in
the
dusty
peace
of
his
office
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
called
on
the
Perrys
at
their
rooms
above
Howland
&
Gould
's
grocery
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
already
old
they
had
lost
the
money
,
which
they
had
*NL*
invested
in
an
elevator
.
They
had
given
up
their
beloved
yellow
brick
*NL*
house
and
moved
into
these
rooms
over
a
store
,
which
were
the
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
equivalent
of
a
flat
.
A
broad
stairway
led
from
the
street
*NL*
to
the
upper
hall
,
along
which
were
the
doors
of
a
lawyer
's
office
,
a
*NL*
dentist
's
,
a
photographer
's
``
studio
,
''
the
lodge-rooms
of
the
Affiliated
*NL*
Order
of
Spartans
and
,
at
the
back
,
the
Perrys
'
apartment
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
received
her
-LRB-
their
first
caller
in
a
month
-RRB-
with
aged
fluttering
*NL*
tenderness
.
Mrs.
Perry
confided
,
``
My
,
it
's
a
shame
we
got
to
entertain
*NL*
you
in
such
a
cramped
place
.
And
there
ai
n't
any
water
except
that
ole
*NL*
iron
sink
outside
in
the
hall
,
but
still
,
as
I
say
to
Champ
,
beggars
*NL*
ca
n't
be
choosers
.
`
Sides
,
the
brick
house
was
too
big
for
me
to
sweep
,
*NL*
and
it
was
way
out
,
and
it
's
nice
to
be
living
down
here
among
folks
.
*NL*
Yes
,
we
're
glad
to
be
here
.
But
--
Some
day
,
maybe
we
can
have
a
house
*NL*
of
our
own
again
.
We
're
saving
up
--
Oh
,
dear
,
if
we
could
have
our
own
*NL*
home
!
But
these
rooms
are
real
nice
,
ai
n't
they
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
old
people
will
,
the
world
over
,
they
had
moved
as
much
as
possible
*NL*
of
their
familiar
furniture
into
this
small
space
.
Carol
had
none
of
the
*NL*
superiority
she
felt
toward
Mrs.
Lyman
Cass
's
plutocratic
parlor
.
She
*NL*
was
at
home
here
.
She
noted
with
tenderness
all
the
makeshifts

CHAPTER

*NL*
SHE
tried
,
more
from
loyalty
than
from
desire
,
to
call
upon
the
Perrys
*NL*
on
a
November
evening
when
Kennicott
was
away
.
They
were
not
at
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
a
child
who
has
no
one
to
play
with
she
loitered
through
the
dark
*NL*
hall
.
She
saw
a
light
under
an
office
door
.
She
knocked
.
To
the
person
*NL*
who
opened
she
murmured
,
``
Do
you
happen
to
know
where
the
Perrys
are
?

She
realized
that
it
was
Guy
Pollock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
awfully
sorry
,
Mrs.
Kennicott
,
but
I
do
n't
know

n't
you
come
in

and
wait

*NL*
*NL*
``
W-why

''
she
observed
,
as
she
reflected
that
in
Gopher
Prairie
it
*NL*
is
not
decent
to
call
on
a
man
;
as
she
decided
that
no
,
really
,
she
*NL*
would
n't
go
in
;
and
as
she
went
in
.
*NL*
*NL*

did

know

was
up

next
to
the
Duke
of
Sutherland
's

're
*NL*
beyond
that
inner
door

are
a
cot
and
a
wash-stand
and
my
other
*NL*
suit
and
the
blue
crepe
tie

said
you

``
You
remember

saying

Of

always
shall

*NL*
She
glanced
about
the
rusty
office
--
gaunt
stove
,
shelves
of
tan
*NL*
law-books
,
desk-chair
filled
with
newspapers
so
long
sat
upon
that
they
*NL*
were
in
holes
and
smudged
to
grayness
.
There
were
only
two
things
which
*NL*
suggested
Guy
Pollock
.
On
the
green
felt
of
the
table-desk
,
between
*NL*
legal
blanks
and
a
clotted
inkwell
,
was
a
cloissone
vase
.
On
a
swing
*NL*
shelf
was
a
row
of
books
unfamiliar
to
Gopher
Prairie
:
Mosher
editions
*NL*
of
the
poets
,
black
and
red
German
novels
,
a
Charles
Lamb
in
crushed
*NL*
levant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
did
not
sit
down
.
He
quartered
the
office
,
a
grayhound
on
the
scent
;
*NL*
a
grayhound
with
glasses
tilted
forward
on
his
thin
nose
,
and
a
silky
*NL*
indecisive
brown
mustache
.
He
had
a
golf
jacket
of
jersey
,
worn
through
*NL*
at
the
creases
in
the
sleeves
.
She
noted
that
he
did
not
apologize
for
*NL*
it
,
as
Kennicott
would
have
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
made
conversation
:
``
I
did
n't
know
you
were
a
bosom
friend
of
the
*NL*
Perrys

Champ

the
salt

earth

somehow
I
ca
n't
imagine
him

you

dancing

making
improvements
on

Diesel
*NL*
engine

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

's

along
with
General
Grant
's
sword

I
'm
--
Oh

'm

for

gospel

evangelize

*NL*
``
Really

it

what

``

carnival

it

merely

safe

the

*NL*
``
Perhaps

I
'm
not
defending
the
town

It
's
merely
--
I
'm
a
confirmed

doubter
of
myself

-LRB-
Probably
I
'm
conceited
about
my
lack

*NL*
Anyway
,
Gopher
Prairie
is
n't
particularly
bad
.
It
's
like
all
villages
in
*NL*
all
countries

Most
places
that
have
lost
the
smell
of
earth

not

yet
acquired
the
smell
of
patchouli

or
of
factory-smoke

are
just
as

suspicious
and
righteous
.
I
wonder
if
the
small
town
is
n't
,
with
some
*NL*
lovely
exceptions
,
a
social
appendix
?
Some
day
these
dull
market-towns

may
be
as
obsolete

I
can
imagine
the
farmer

local
store-manager
going
by
monorail
,
at
the
end

the
day

charming

asked
impulsively

He
dropped
into
the
shrieking
desk-chair

He
looked
squarely
at
her
;
she
*NL*
was
conscious
of
the
pupils
of
his
eyes
;
of
the
fact
that
he
was
a
man
,
*NL*
and
lonely

They
were
embarrassed

They
elaborately
glanced
away

*NL*
were
relieved
as
he
went
on

*NL*
*NL*
``
The
diagnosis
of
my
Village
Virus
is
simple
enough

I
was
born
in
an
*NL*
Ohio
town
about
the
same
size
as
Gopher
Prairie
,
and
much
less
*NL*
friendly

It

had
more
generations

form

oligarchy

respectability

hunting

motoring

There
,
we
did
n't
*NL*
take
in
even
our
own
till
we
had
contemptuously
got
used
to
them

It
*NL*
was
a
red-brick
Ohio
town
,
and
the
trees
made
it
damp
,
and
it
smelled
of
*NL*
rotten
apples
.
The
country
was
n't
like
our
lakes
and
prairie

There
were
*NL*
small
stuffy
corn-fields
and
brick-yards
and
greasy
oil-wells

I
went
to

explain
it

God

creep
around

try

catch

went

for
four

I
lived

Oh

Naturally

Please

*NL*
``
Twenty-six
!
I
was
just
leaving
New
York
,
at
twenty-six
.
I
heard
Patti
*NL*
sing
,
at
twenty-six
.
And
now
I
'm
forty-seven
.
I
feel
like
a
child
,
yet
*NL*
I
'm
old
enough
to
be
your
father
.
So
it
's
decently
paternal
to
imagine
*NL*
you
curled
at
my
feet
...
Of
course
I
hope
it
is
n't
,
but
we
'll
*NL*
reflect
the
morals
of
Gopher
Prairie
by
officially
announcing
that
it
*NL*
is
!
...
These
standards
that
you
and
I
live
up
to
!
There
's
one
thing
*NL*
that
's
the
matter
with
Gopher
Prairie
,
at
least
with
the
ruling-class
*NL*
-LRB-
there
is
a
ruling-class
,
despite
all
our
professions
of
democracy
-RRB-
.
*NL*
And
the
penalty
we
tribal
rulers
pay
is
that
our
subjects
watch
us
*NL*
every
minute
.
We
ca
n't
get
wholesomely
drunk
and
relax
.
We
have
to
be
*NL*
so
correct
about
sex
morals
,
and
inconspicuous
clothes
,
and
doing
our
*NL*
commercial
trickery
only
in
the
traditional
ways
,
that
none
of
us
can
*NL*
live
up
to
it
,
and
we
become
horribly
hypocritical
.
Unavoidably
.
The
*NL*
widow-robbing
deacon
of
fiction
ca
n't
help
being
hypocritical
.
The
*NL*
widows
themselves
demand
it
!
They
admire
his
unctuousness
.
And
look
at
*NL*
me
.
Suppose
I
did
dare
to
make
love
to
--
some
exquisite
married
woman
.
*NL*
I
would
n't
admit
it
to
myself
.
I
giggle
with
the
most
revolting
*NL*
salaciousness
over
La
Vie
Parisienne
,
when
I
get
hold
of
one
in
Chicago
,
*NL*
yet
I
should
n't
even
try
to
hold
your
hand
.
I
'm
broken
.
It
's
the
*NL*
historical
Anglo-Saxon
way
of
making
life
miserable
...
Oh
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
I
have
n't
talked
to
anybody
about
myself
and
all
our
selves
for
years

He
disposed
of
it

a

ruling
out
an
improper
*NL*
objection
;
returned
to
matters
less
uncomfortably
energetic

beaten

keep

we

*NL*
Here
in

we

become
soft

*NL*
we
make
ourselves
unhappy

Methodists
disliking

the

the
Hudson
laughing
at

the
man
with

The
worst
is
the
commercial
hatred
--
the
grocer
*NL*
feeling
that
any
man
who
does
n't
deal
with
him
is
robbing
him
.
What
*NL*
hurts
me
is
that
it
applies
to
lawyers

doctors

decidedly
*NL*
to
their
wives

-RRB-
as
much
as
to
grocers

looked

sprang
up

He
picked
up

peered

loneliness

was
startled

his
eyes
faded
into
impersonality

talked

sought

maintain
privacy
by

undressing
behind

Kennicott
was
not
so
*NL*
reticent

Tonight

as

she
was
irritated

to
push

the

plush
chair
out
of

could
open

Every

opened

shoved

Ten
times
an

Kennicott
liked

the

there
was

no

in

*NL*
She
pushed
it

felt
angry

hid
her
anger

Kennicott
was
yawning

more
*NL*
portentously

The
room
smelled
stale

She
shrugged
and
became
chatty
:

*NL*
``

speaking

hung

on

've
*NL*
always

a
suspicion

did
a
good

four-flushing
about

likes

have
people

keeps
up
his
French

Greek
and
Lord
*NL*
knows
what
all

and
he
's
always
got
an
old
Dago
book
lying
around
the
*NL*
sitting-room

I
've
got
a
hunch
he
reads
detective

I
do

where
he

He
kind
of
lets
people
assume
he
went
to
Harvard

Berlin

Oxford

somewhere

I
looked
him
up
in
the
medical

he
graduated
from

back
in
1861

treated

Nothing

kept
calling
on

calling
on
her
for
weeks

almost
every
*NL*
day
,
and
he
sent
her
a
good
big
fat
bill
,
too
,
you
can
bet
!
I
never

did
forgive
him
for
that

Jonderquists

*NL*
*NL*
In
her

nightgown
she
was
standing
at

engaged
in
the
*NL*
invariable
rites
of
wishing
that
she
had
a
real
dressing-table
with
a

triple
mirror

of
bending
toward
the
streaky
glass
and
raising
her
chin
*NL*
to
inspect
a
pin-head
mole
on
her
throat
,
and
finally
of
brushing
her
*NL*
hair
.
In
rhythm
to
the
strokes
she
went
on
:

flipped

kick

tucked

saw

grin
in

flushed

with
his
arms
behind

was
yawning

I
must

tired

Luke

been
coming

me
for
every
toeache
and
headache

a

of
little
things

just

wasted
my
time

then
when
his
grandchild
was
here
last
summer

had
summer-complaint

I
suppose

something
like
that
,
probably
--
you
*NL*
know

the
time
you
and
I
drove
up
to
Lac-qui-Meurt
--
why
,
Westlake
got
*NL*
hold
of
Ma
Dawson
,
and
scared
her
to
death
,
and
made
her
think
the
kid
*NL*
had
appendicitis
,
and
,
by
golly
,
if
he
and
McGanum
did
n't
operate
,
and
*NL*
holler
their
heads
off
about
the
terrible
adhesions
they
found
,
and
what
*NL*
a
regular
Charley
and
Will
Mayo
they
were
for
classy
surgery
.
They
let
*NL*
on
that
if
they
'd
waited
two
hours
more
the
kid
would
have
developed
*NL*
peritonitis
,
and
God
knows
what
all
;
and
then
they
collected
a
nice
*NL*
fat
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
.
And
probably
they
'd
have
charged
three
*NL*
hundred
,
if
they
had
n't
been
afraid
of
me

I
'm
no

I
certainly

do
hate
to
give
old
Luke
ten
dollars

worth
of
advice
for
a
dollar

a
*NL*
half
,
and
then
see
a
hundred

fifty
go
glimmering

if
I
ca

He

He
turned
out

his

making
one
solid
thud

He
marched
from
the

a
grotesque
figure
in
baggy
union-pajamas

She
heard
him
drawing
*NL*
a
drink
of
water
at
the
bathroom
tap

She
was
furious
at
the
*NL*
contemptuousness
of
his
exit

She
snuggled
down
in
bed
,
and
looked
*NL*
away
from
him
as

returned

He
ignored
her

As

flumped
into

he

yawned

casually
stated

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
Now
it
was
she
who
grunted
``
Huh

and
ignored
him
,
and
felt
independent
*NL*
and
masterful
as
she
shot
up
out
of
bed
,
turned
her
back
on
him
,
*NL*
fished
a
lone
and
petrified
chocolate
out
of
her
glove-box
in
the
*NL*
top
right-hand
drawer
of
the
bureau
,
gnawed
at
it
,
found
that
it
had
*NL*
cocoanut
filling
,
said
``

wished
that
she
had
not
said
it

so
that
*NL*
she
might
be
superior
to
his
colloquialism
,
and
hurled
the
chocolate
*NL*
into
the
wastebasket
,
where
it
made
an
evil
and
mocking
clatter
among
*NL*
the
debris
of
torn
linen
collars
and

box
.
Then
,
in
great
*NL*
dignity
and
self-dramatization
,
she
returned

*NL*
All
this
time

had
been
talking
on
,
embroidering
his
assertion
that
*NL*
he
``

expect
any

She
was
reflecting
that
he
was
a
rustic
,
*NL*
that
she
hated
him
,
that
she
had
been
insane
to
marry
him

that
she
had

married
him
only
because

was
tired

that

must
get

long
gloves
cleaned

that
she
would
never
do
anything
more
for
him

*NL*
and
that
she
must
n't
forget
his
hominy
for
breakfast

She
was
roused
to

attention
by
his
storming
:

*NL*
``

up

She
said
coldly

a
great
reformer
but
as
the
wife
of
a
*NL*
country
physician
.
The
realities
of
the
doctor
's
household
were
colored
*NL*
by
her
pride
.
*NL*
*NL*
Late
at
night
,
a
step
on
the
wooden
porch
,
heard
through
her
confusion
*NL*
of
sleep
;
the
storm-door
opened
;
fumbling
over
the
inner
door-panels
;
*NL*
the
buzz
of
the
electric
bell
.
Kennicott
muttering
``
Gol
darn
it
,
''
but
*NL*
patiently
creeping
out
of
bed
,
remembering
to
draw
the
covers
up
to
keep
*NL*
her
warm
,
feeling
for
slippers
and
bathrobe
,
clumping
down-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
below
,
half-heard
in
her
drowsiness
,
a
colloquy
in
the
*NL*
pidgin-German
of
the
farmers
who
have
forgotten
the
Old
Country
language
*NL*
without
learning
the
new
:
*NL*
*NL*
``

The

closing

Barney
's
wagon

the
wheels
silent
in
the
snow
,
but
the
*NL*
wagon-body
rattling

Kennicott
clicking
the
receiver-hook
to
rouse
the
*NL*
night
telephone-operator
,
giving
a
number
,
waiting

cursing
mildly
,
*NL*
waiting
again

at

growling
,

*NL*
*NL*
His
step
on
the
stairs
;
his
quiet
moving
about
the
frigid
room
while
he
*NL*
dressed
;
his
abstracted
and
meaningless
cough
.
She
was
supposed
to
be
*NL*
asleep
;
she
was
too
exquisitely
drowsy
to
break
the
charm
by
speaking
.
*NL*
On
a
slip
of
paper
laid
on
the
bureau
--
she
could
hear
the
pencil
*NL*
grinding
against
the
marble
slab
--
he
wrote
his
destination
.
He
went
out
,
*NL*
hungry
,
chilly
,
unprotesting
;
and
she
,
before
she
fell
asleep
again
,
*NL*
loved
him
for
his
sturdiness
,
and
saw
the
drama
of
his
riding
by
night
*NL*
to
the
frightened
household
on
the
distant
farm
;
pictured
children
*NL*
standing
at
a
window
,
waiting
for
him
.
He
suddenly
had
in
her
eyes
the
*NL*
heroism
of
a
wireless
operator
on
a
ship
in
a
collision
;
of
an
explorer
,
*NL*
fever-clawed
,
deserted
by
his
bearers
,
but
going
on
--
jungle
--
going
--
*NL*
*NL*
At
six
,
when
the
light
faltered
in
as
through
ground
glass
and
bleakly
*NL*
identified
the
chairs
as
gray
rectangles
,
she
heard
his
step
on
the
*NL*
porch
;
heard
him
at
the
furnace
:
the
rattle
of
shaking
the
grate
,
the
*NL*
slow
grinding
removal
of
ashes
,
the
shovel
thrust
into
the
coal-bin
,
*NL*
the
abrupt
clatter
of
the
coal
as
it
flew
into
the
fire-box
,
the
fussy
*NL*
regulation
of
drafts
--
the
daily
sounds
of
a
Gopher
Prairie
life
,
now
*NL*
first
appealing
to
her
as
something
brave
and
enduring
,
many-colored
*NL*
and
free
.
She
visioned
the
fire-box
:
flames
turned
to
lemon
and
metallic
*NL*
gold
as
the
coal-dust
sifted
over
them
;
thin
twisty
flutters
of
purple
,
*NL*
ghost
flames
which
gave
no
light
,
slipping
up
between
the
dark
banked
*NL*
coals
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
luxurious
in
bed
,
and
the
house
would
be
warm
for
her
when
*NL*
she
rose
,
she
reflected
.
What
a
worthless
cat
she
was
!
What
were
her
*NL*
aspirations
beside
his
capability
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
awoke
again
as
he
dropped
into
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seems
just
a
few
minutes
ago
that
you
started
out
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
away
four
hours
.
I
've
operated
a
woman
for
appendicitis
,
in
*NL*
a
Dutch
kitchen
.
Came
awful
close
to
losing
her
,
too
,

I
pulled
her
*NL*
through
all
right

Close
squeak

Barney
says
he
shot
ten
rabbits
last
*NL*
Sunday
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
instantly
asleep
--
one
hour
of
rest
before
he
had
to
be
up
and
*NL*
ready
for
the
farmers
who
came
in
early
.
She
marveled
that
in
what
was
*NL*
to
her
but
a
night-blurred
moment
,
he
should
have
been
in
a
distant
*NL*
place
,
have
taken
charge
of
a
strange
house
,
have
slashed
a
woman
,
saved
*NL*
a
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
wonder
he
detested
the
lazy
Westlake
and
McGanum
!
How
could
the
*NL*
easy
Guy
Pollock
understand
this
skill
and
endurance
?
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Kennicott
was
grumbling
,
``
Seven-fifteen
!
Are
n't
you
ever
going
*NL*
to
get
up
for
breakfast
?
''
and
he
was
not
a
hero-scientist
but
a
rather
*NL*
irritable
and
commonplace
man
who
needed
a
shave
.
They
had
coffee
,
*NL*
griddle-cakes
,
and
sausages
,
and
talked
about
Mrs.
McGanum
's
atrocious
*NL*
alligator-hide
belt
.
Night
witchery
and
morning
disillusion
were
alike
*NL*
forgotten
in
the
march
of
realities
and
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
Familiar
to
the
doctor
's
wife
was
the
man
with
an
injured
leg
,
driven
in
*NL*
from
the
country
on
a
Sunday
afternoon
and
brought
to
the
house
.
He
*NL*
sat
in
a
rocker
in
the
back
of
a
lumber-wagon
,
his
face
pale
from
the
*NL*
anguish
of
the
jolting
.
His
leg
was
thrust
out
before
him
,
resting
on
*NL*
a
starch-box
and
covered
with
a
leather-bound
horse-blanket
.
His
drab
*NL*
courageous
wife
drove
the
wagon
,
and
she
helped
Kennicott
support
him
as
*NL*
he
hobbled
up
the
steps
,
into
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fellow
cut
his
leg
with
an
ax
--
pretty
bad
gash
--
Halvor
Nelson
,
nine
*NL*
miles
out
,
''
Kennicott
observed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
fluttered
at
the
back
of
the
room
,
childishly
excited
when
she
was
*NL*
sent
to
fetch
towels
and
a
basin
of
water
.
Kennicott
lifted
the
farmer
*NL*
into
a
chair
and
chuckled
,
``
There
we
are
,
Halvor
!
We
'll
have
you
out
*NL*
fixing
fences
and
drinking
aquavit
in
a
month
.
''
The
farmwife
sat
on
*NL*
the
couch
,
expressionless
,
bulky
in
a
man
's
dogskin
coat
and
unplumbed
*NL*
layers
of
jackets
.
The
flowery
silk
handkerchief
which
she
had
worn
over
*NL*
her
head
now
hung
about
her
seamed
neck
.
Her
white
wool
gloves
lay
in
*NL*
her
lap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
drew
from
the
injured
leg
the
thick
red
``
German
sock
,
''
the
*NL*
innumerous
other
socks
of
gray
and
white
wool
,
then
the
spiral
bandage
.
*NL*
The
leg
was
of
an
unwholesome
dead
white
,
with
the
black
hairs
feeble
*NL*
and
thin
and
flattened
,
and
the
scar
a
puckered
line
of
crimson
.
Surely
,
*NL*
Carol
shuddered
,
this
was
not
human
flesh
,
the
rosy
shining
tissue
of
*NL*
the
amorous
poets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
examined
the
scar
,
smiled
at
Halvor
and
his
wife
,
chanted
,
*NL*
``
Fine
,
b
'
gosh
!
Could
n't
be
better
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Nelsons
looked
deprecating
.
The
farmer
nodded
a
cue
to
his
wife
and
*NL*
she
mourned
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Vell
,
how
much
ve
going
to
owe
you
,
doctor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
it
'll
be
--
Let
's
see
:
one
drive
out
and
two
calls
.
I
guess
*NL*
it
'll
be
about
eleven
dollars
in
all
,
Lena

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dunno
ve
can
pay
you
yoost
a
little
w
`
ile

doctor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
lumbered
over
to
her
,
patted
her
shoulder
,
roared
,
``
Why
,
Lord
*NL*
love
you
,
sister
,
I
wo
n't
worry
if
I
never
get
it
!
You
pay
me
next
fall
,
*NL*
when
you
get
your
crop

Carrie

Suppose
you
or
Bea
could
shake
up
*NL*
a
cup
of
coffee
and
some
cold
lamb
for
the
Nelsons
?
They
got
a
long
cold
*NL*
drive
ahead

*NL*
He
had
been
gone
since
morning
;
her
eyes
ached
with
reading
;
Vida
*NL*
Sherwin
could
not
come
to
tea
.
She
wandered
through
the
house
,
empty
as
*NL*
the
bleary
street
without
.
The
problem
of
``
Will
the
doctor
be
home
in
*NL*
time
for
supper
,
or
shall
I
sit
down
without
him
?
''
was
important
in
*NL*
the
household
.
Six
was
the
rigid
,
the
canonical
supper-hour
,
but
at
*NL*
half-past
six
he
had
not
come
.
Much
speculation
with
Bea
:
Had
the
*NL*
obstetrical
case
taken
longer
than
he
had
expected
?
Had
he
been
called
*NL*
somewhere
else
?
Was
the
snow
much
heavier
out
in
the
country
,
so
that
he
*NL*
should
have
taken
a
buggy
,
or
even
a
cutter
,
instead
of
the
car
?
Here
in
*NL*
town
it
had
melted
a
lot
,
but
still
--
*NL*
*NL*
A
honking
,
a
shout
,
the
motor
engine
raced
before
it
was
shut
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hurried
to
the
window
.
The
car
was
a
monster
at
rest
after
furious
*NL*
adventures
.
The
headlights
blazed
on
the
clots
of
ice
in
the
road
so
*NL*
that
the
tiniest
lumps
gave
mountainous
shadows
,
and
the
taillight
cast
*NL*
a
circle
of
ruby
on
the
snow
behind
.
Kennicott
was
opening
the
door
,
*NL*
crying
,
``
Here
we
are
,
old
girl
!
Got
stuck
couple
times
,
but
we
made
it
,
*NL*
by
golly
,
we
made
it
,
and
here
we
be
!
Come
on
!
Food
!
Eatin

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rushed
to
him
,
patted
his
fur
coat
,
the
long
hairs
smooth
but
chilly
*NL*
to
her
fingers
.
She
joyously
summoned
Bea
,
``
All
right
!
He
's
here
!
We
'll
*NL*
sit
right
down
!

There
were
,
to
inform
the
doctor
's
wife
of
his
successes
no
clapping
*NL*
audiences
nor
book-reviews
nor
honorary
degrees
.
But
there
was
a
*NL*
letter
written
by
a
German
farmer
recently
moved
from
Minnesota
to
*NL*
Saskatchewan
:

*NL*
She
encountered
Guy
Pollock
at
the
drug
store
.
He
looked
at
her
as
*NL*
though
he
had
a
right
to
;
he
spoke
softly
.
``
I
have
n't
see
you
,
the
last
*NL*
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
've
been
out
in
the
country
with
Will
several
times

He
's
so
--
Do
*NL*
you
know
that
people
like
you
and
me
can
never
understand
people
like
*NL*
him
?
We
're
a
pair
of
hypercritical
loafers
,
you
and
I
,
while
he
quietly
*NL*
goes
and
does
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
and
smiled
and
was
very
busy
about
purchasing
boric
acid
.
He
*NL*
stared
after
her
,
and
slipped
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
found
that
he
was
gone
she
was
slightly
disconcerted

She
could
--
at
times
--
agree
with
Kennicott
that
the
shaving-and-corsets
*NL*
familiarity
of
married
life
was
not
dreary
vulgarity
but
a
wholesome
*NL*
frankness
;
that
artificial
reticences
might
merely
be
irritating
.
She
*NL*
was
not
much
disturbed
when
for
hours
he
sat
about
the
living-room
in
*NL*
his
honest
socks
.
But
she
would
not
listen
to
his
theory
that
``
all
this
*NL*
romance
stuff
is
simply
moonshine
--
elegant
when
you
're
courting
,
but
no
*NL*
use
busting
yourself
keeping
it
up
all
your
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
of
surprises
,
games
,
to
vary
the
days
.
She
knitted
an
*NL*
astounding
purple
scarf
,
which
she
hid
under
his
supper
plate
.
-LRB-
When
*NL*
he
discovered
it
he
looked
embarrassed
,
and
gasped
,
``
Is
today
an
*NL*
anniversary
or
something
?
Gosh
,
I
'd
forgotten
it
!
''
-RRB-
*NL*
*NL*
Once
she
filled
a
thermos
bottle
with
hot
coffee
a
corn-flakes
box
with
*NL*
cookies
just
baked
by
Bea
,
and
bustled
to
his
office
at
three
in
the
*NL*
afternoon
.
She
hid
her
bundles
in
the
hall
and
peeped
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
office
was
shabby
.
Kennicott
had
inherited
it
from
a
medical
*NL*
predecessor
,
and
changed
it
only
by
adding
a
white
enameled
*NL*
operating-table
,
a
sterilizer
,
a
Roentgen-ray
apparatus
,
and
a
small
*NL*
portable
typewriter
.
It
was
a
suite
of
two
rooms
:
a
waiting-room
with
*NL*
straight
chairs
,
shaky
pine
table
,
and
those
coverless
and
unknown
*NL*
magazines
which
are
found
only
in
the
offices
of
dentists
and
*NL*
doctors
.
The
room
beyond
,
looking
on
Main
Street
,
was
business-office
,
*NL*
consulting-room
,
operating-room
,
and
,
in
an
alcove
,
bacteriological
*NL*
and
chemical
laboratory
.
The
wooden
floors
of
both
rooms
were
bare
;
the
*NL*
furniture
was
brown
and
scaly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Waiting
for
the
doctor
were
two
women
,
as
still
as
though
they
were
*NL*
paralyzed
,
and
a
man
in
a
railroad
brakeman
's
uniform
,
holding
his
*NL*
bandaged
right
hand
with
his
tanned
left
.
They
stared
at
Carol
.
She
sat
*NL*
modestly
in
a
stiff
chair
,
feeling
frivolous
and
out
of
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
appeared
at
the
inner
door
,
ushering
out
a
bleached
man
with
*NL*
a
trickle
of
wan
beard
,
and
consoling
him
,
``
All
right
,
Dad
.
Be
careful
*NL*
about
the
sugar
,
and
mind
the
diet
I
gave
you
.
Gut
the
prescription
*NL*
filled
,
and
come
in
and
see
me
next
week
.
Say
,
uh
,
better
,
uh
,
better
*NL*
not
drink
too
much
beer
.
All
right
,
Dad
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
voice
was
artificially
hearty
.
He
looked
absently
at
Carol
.
He
was
*NL*
a
medical
machine
now
,
not
a
domestic
machine
.
``
What
is
it
,
Carrie
?
''
he
*NL*
droned
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
hurry
.
Just
wanted
to
say
hello
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Self-pity
because
he
did
not
divine
that
this
was
a
surprise
party
*NL*
rendered
her
sad
and
interesting
to
herself
,
and
she
had
the
pleasure
of
*NL*
the
martyrs
in
saying
bravely
to
him
,
``
It
's
nothing
special
.
If
you
're
*NL*
busy
long
I
'll
trot
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
waited
she
ceased
to
pity
and
began
to
mock
herself
.
For
the
*NL*
first
time
she
observed
the
waiting-room
.
Oh
yes
,
the
doctor
's
family
*NL*
had
to
have
obi
panels
and
a
wide
couch
and
an
electric
percolator
,
but
*NL*
any
hole
was
good
enough
for
sick
tired
common
people
who
were
nothing
*NL*
but
the
one
means
and
excuse
for
the
doctor
's
existing
!
No
.
She
could
n't
*NL*
blame
Kennicott
.
He
was
satisfied
by
the
shabby
chairs
.
He
put
up
with
*NL*
them
as
his
patients
did
.
It
was
her
neglected
province
--
she
who
had
*NL*
been
going
about
talking
of
rebuilding
the
whole
town
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
patients
were
gone
she
brought
in
her
bundles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
those
?
''
wondered
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Turn
your
back
!
Look
out
of
the
window
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
obeyed
--
not
very
much
bored
.
When
she
cried
``
Now
!
''
a
feast
of
cookies
*NL*
and
small
hard
candies
and
hot
coffee
was
spread
on
the
roll-top
desk
in
*NL*
the
inner
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
broad
face
lightened
.
``
That
's
a
new
one
on
me
!
Never
was
more
*NL*
surprised
in
my
life
!
And
,
by
golly
,
I
believe
I
am
hungry
.
Say
,
this
is
*NL*
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
first
exhilaration
of
the
surprise
had
declined
she
demanded
,
*NL*
``
Will
!
I
'm
going
to
refurnish
your
waiting-room
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
the
matter
with
it
?
It
's
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
!
It
's
hideous
.
We
can
afford
to
give
your
patients
a
better
*NL*
place
.
And
it
would
be
good
business
.
''
She
felt
tremendously
politic
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rats
!
I
do
n't
worry
about
the
business
.
You
look
here
now
:
As
I
told
*NL*
you
--
Just
because
I
like
to
tuck
a
few
dollars
away
,
I
'll
be
switched
*NL*
if
I
'll
stand
for
your
thinking
I
'm
nothing
but
a
dollar-chasing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stop
it
!
Quick
!
I
'm
not
hurting
your
feelings
!
I
'm
not
criticizing
!
I
'm
*NL*
the
adoring
least
one
of
thy
harem
.
I
just
mean
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Two
days
later
,
with
pictures
,
wicker
chairs
,
a
rug
,
she
had
made
the
*NL*
waiting-room
habitable
;
and
Kennicott
admitted
,
``
Does
look
a
lot
better
.
*NL*
Never
thought
much
about
it
.
Guess
I
need
being
bullied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
convinced
that
she
was
gloriously
content
in
her
career
as
*NL*
doctor
's
-
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
free
herself
from
the
speculation
and
disillusionment
which
*NL*
had
been
twitching
at
her
;
sought
to
dismiss
all
the
opinionation
of
an
*NL*
insurgent
era
.
She
wanted
to
shine
upon
the
veal-faced
bristly-bearded
*NL*
Lyman
Cass
as
much
as
upon
Miles
Bjornstam
or
Guy
Pollock
.
She
gave
a
*NL*
reception
for
the
Thanatopsis
Club
.
But
her
real
acquiring
of
merit
*NL*
was
in
calling
upon
that
Mrs.
Bogart
whose
gossipy
good
opinion
was
so
*NL*
valuable
to
a
doctor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
the
Bogart
house
was
next
door
she
had
entered
it
but
three
*NL*
times
.
Now
she
put
on
her
new
moleskin
cap
,
which
made
her
face
small
*NL*
and
innocent
,
she
rubbed
off
the
traces
of
a
lip-stick
--
and
fled
across
*NL*
the
alley
before
her
admirable
resolution
should
sneak
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
age
of
houses
,
like
the
age
of
men
,
has
small
relation
to
their
*NL*
years
.
The
dull-green
cottage
of
the
good
Widow
Bogart
was
twenty
years
*NL*
old
,
but
it
had
the
antiquity
of
Cheops
,
and
the
smell
of
mummy-dust
.
*NL*
Its
neatness
rebuked
the
street
.
The
two
stones
by
the
path
were
painted
*NL*
yellow
;
the
outhouse
was
so
overmodestly
masked
with
vines
and
lattice
*NL*
that
it
was
not
concealed
at
all
;
the
last
iron
dog
remaining
in
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
stood
among
whitewashed
conch-shells
upon
the
lawn
.
The
hallway
*NL*
was
dismayingly
scrubbed
;
the
kitchen
was
an
exercise
in
mathematics
,
*NL*
with
problems
worked
out
in
equidistant
chairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlor
was
kept
for
visitors
.
Carol
suggested
,
``
Let
's
sit
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
.
Please
do
n't
trouble
to
light
the
parlor
stove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
trouble
at
all
!
My
gracious
,
and
you
coming
so
seldom
and
all
,
and
*NL*
the
kitchen
is
a
perfect
sight
,
I
try
to
keep
it
clean
,
but
Cy
will
*NL*
track
mud
all
over
it
,
I
've
spoken
to
him
about
it
a
hundred
times
if
*NL*
I
've
spoken
once
,
no
,
you
sit
right
there
,
dearie
,
and
I
'll
make
a
fire
,
*NL*
no
trouble
at
all
,
practically
no
trouble
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
groaned
,
rubbed
her
joints
,
and
repeatedly
dusted
her
hands
*NL*
while
she
made
the
fire
,
and
when
Carol
tried
to
help
she
lamented
,
*NL*
``
Oh
,
it
does
n't
matter
;
guess
I
ai
n't
good
for
much
but
toil
and
workin
'
*NL*
anyway
;
seems
as
though
that
's
what
a
lot
of
folks
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
parlor
was
distinguished
by
an
expanse
of
rag
carpet
from
which
,
as
*NL*
they
entered
,
Mrs.
Bogart
hastily
picked
one
sad
dead
fly
.
In
the
center
*NL*
of
the
carpet
was
a
rug
depicting
a
red
Newfoundland
dog
,
reclining
in
a
*NL*
green
and
yellow
daisy
field
and
labeled
``
Our
Friend
.
''
The
parlor
organ
,
*NL*
tall
and
thin
,
was
adorned
with
a
mirror
partly
circular
,
partly
square
,
*NL*
and
partly
diamond-shaped
,
and
with
brackets
holding
a
pot
of
geraniums
,
*NL*
a
mouth-organ
,
and
a
copy
of
``
The
Oldtime
Hymnal
.
''
On
the
center
*NL*
table
was
a
Sears-Roebuck
mail-order
catalogue
,
a
silver
frame
with
*NL*
photographs
of
the
Baptist
Church
and
of
an
elderly
clergyman
,
and
*NL*
an
aluminum
tray
containing
a
rattlesnake
's
rattle
and
a
broken
*NL*
spectacle-lens
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
spoke
of
the
eloquence
of
the
Reverend
Mr.
Zitterel
,
*NL*
the
coldness
of
cold
days
,
the
price
of
poplar
wood
,
Dave
Dyer
's
new
*NL*
hair-cut
,
and
Cy
Bogart
's
essential
piety
.
``
As
I
said
to
his
Sunday
*NL*
School
teacher
,
Cy
may
be
a
little
wild
,
but
that
's
because
he
's
got
so
*NL*
much
better
brains
than
a
lot
of
these
boys
,
and
this
farmer
that
claims
*NL*
he
caught
Cy
stealing
`
beggies
,
is
a
liar
,
and
I
ought
to
have
the
law
*NL*
on
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
went
thoroughly
into
the
rumor
that
the
girl
waiter
at
*NL*
Billy
's
Lunch
was
not
all
she
might
be
--
or
,
rather
,
was
quite
all
she
*NL*
might
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
lands
,
what
can
you
expect
when
everybody
knows
what
her
mother
was
?
*NL*
And
if
these
traveling
salesmen
would
let
her
alone
she
would
be
all
*NL*
right
,
though
I
certainly
do
n't
believe
she
ought
to
be
allowed
to
think
*NL*
she
can
pull
the
wool
over
our
eyes
.
The
sooner
she
's
sent
to
the
*NL*
school
for
incorrigible
girls
down
at
Sauk
Centre
,
the
better
for
all
*NL*
and
--
Wo

just

of
coffee

lovely

But

Do
n't
you
think
it
's
awful

the
way
folks
talk
in
this
town

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
hitched
her
chair
nearer
.
Her
large
face
,
with
its
*NL*
disturbing
collection
of
moles
and
lone
black
hairs
,
wrinkled
*NL*
cunningly
.
She
showed
her
decayed
teeth
in
a
reproving
smile
,
and
in
the
*NL*
confidential
voice
of
one
who
scents
stale
bedroom
scandal
she
breathed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
do
n't
see
how

the

I

so
innocent

Just
the
other
day

I
never
pay
no
attention

stories

I
heard
*NL*
it
mighty
good
and
straight
that
Harry

is
carrying
on
with
a
*NL*
girl
that
clerks
in
a
store
down
in
Minneapolis
,
and
poor
Juanita
*NL*
not
knowing
anything
about
it

though
maybe
it
's
the
judgment
of
*NL*
God
,
because
before
she
married
Harry
she
acted
up
with
more
than
one
*NL*
boy

Well
,
I
do
n't
like
to
say
it

and
maybe
I
ai
n't
up-to-date

like
*NL*
Cy
says

but
I
always
believed
a
lady
should
n't
even
give
names
to
all
*NL*
sorts
of
dreadful
things
,
but
just
the
same
I
know
there
was
at
least
*NL*
one
case
where
Juanita
and
a
boy
--
well
,
they
were
just
dreadful
.

And
--

Then
there
's
that
Ole
Jenson
the
grocer

that
thinks
he
's
so
*NL*
plaguey
smart
,
and
I
know
he
made
up
to
a
farmer

There

it
seemed

no

was
not
living
a
life
of

shame
except
Mrs.

and
naturally
she
resented
it

*NL*
*NL*
She
knew

She
had
always
happened
to
be
there

Once

she

she

going
by

an
indiscreet
window-shade
had
been
left
up
a

and
I
hope
that
none
of
these
horrid
young
men
that
there
*NL*
are
around
town
will
get
her
into
trouble
!
It
's
their
parents
'
fault
,
*NL*
letting
them
run
wild
and
hear
evil
things
.
If
I
had
my
way
there
*NL*
would
n't
be
none
of
them
,
not
boys
nor
girls
neither
,
allowed
to
know
*NL*
anything
about
--
about
things
till
they
was
married
.
It
's
terrible
the
*NL*
bald
way
that
some
folks
talk
.
It
just
shows
and
gives
away
what
awful
*NL*
thoughts
they
got
inside
them
,
and
there
's
nothing
can
cure
them
except
*NL*
coming
right
to
God
and
kneeling
down
like
I
do
at
prayer-meeting
every
*NL*
Wednesday
evening
,
and
saying
,
'
O
God
,
I
would
be
a
miserable
sinner
*NL*
except
for
thy
grace
.
'
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'd
make
every
last
one
of
these
brats
go
to
Sunday
School
and
learn
*NL*
to
think
about
nice
things
`
stead
of
about
cigarettes
and
goings-on
--
and
*NL*
these
dances
they
have
at
the
lodges
are
the
worst
thing
that
ever
*NL*
happened
to
this
town
,
lot
of
young
men
squeezing
girls
and
finding
*NL*
out
--
Oh
,
it
's
dreadful
.
I
've
told
the
mayor
he
ought
to
put
a
stop
*NL*
to
them
and
--
There
was
one
boy
in
this
town
,
I
do
n't
want
to
be
*NL*
suspicious
or
uncharitable
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
half
an
hour
before
Carol
escaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopped
on
her
own
porch
and
thought
viciously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
woman
is
on
the
side
of
the
angels
,
then
I
have
no
choice
;
I
*NL*
must
be
on
the
side
of
the
devil
.
But
--
is
n't
she
like
me
?
She
too
wants
*NL*
to
`
reform
the
town
'
!
She
too
criticizes
everybody
!
She
too
thinks
the
*NL*
men
are
vulgar
and
limited
!
AM
I
LIKE
HER
?
This
is
ghastly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
she
did
not
merely
consent
to
play
cribbage
with
Kennicott
;
*NL*
she
urged
him
to
play
;
and
she
worked
up
a
hectic
interest
in
land-deals
*NL*
and
Sam
Clark
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
courtship
days
Kennicott
had
shown
her
a
photograph
of
Nels
*NL*
Erdstrom
's
baby
and
log
cabin
,
but
she
had
never
seen
the
Erdstroms
.
*NL*
They
had
become
merely
``
patients
of
the
doctor
.
''
Kennicott
telephoned
*NL*
her
on
a
mid-December
afternoon
,
``
Want
to
throw
your
coat
on
and
drive
*NL*
out
to
Erdstrom
's
with
me
?
Fairly
warm
.
Nels
got
the
jaundice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
''
She
hastened
to
put
on
woolen
stockings
,
high
boots
,
sweater
,
*NL*
muffler
,
cap
,
mittens
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
snow
was
too
thick
and
the
ruts
frozen
too
hard
for
the
motor
.
They
*NL*
drove
out
in
a
clumsy
high
carriage
.
Tucked
over
them
was
a
blue
woolen
*NL*
cover
,
prickly
to
her
wrists
,
and
outside
of
it
a
buffalo
robe
,
humble
*NL*
and
moth-eaten
now
,
used
ever
since
the
bison
herds
had
streaked
the
*NL*
prairie
a
few
miles
to
the
west
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scattered
houses
between
which
they
passed
in
town
were
small
and
*NL*
desolate
in
contrast
to
the
expanse
of
huge
snowy
yards
and
wide
*NL*
street
.
They
crossed
the
railroad
tracks
,
and
instantly
were
in
the
farm
*NL*
country
.
The
big
piebald
horses
snorted
clouds
of
steam
,
and
started
to
*NL*
trot
.
The
carriage
squeaked
in
rhythm
.
Kennicott
drove
with
clucks
of
*NL*
``
There
boy
,
take
it
easy
!
''
He
was
thinking
.
He
paid
no
attention
to
*NL*
Carol
.
Yet
it
was
he
who
commented
,
``
Pretty
nice
,
over
there
,
''
as
they
*NL*
approached
an
oak-grove
where
shifty
winter
sunlight
quivered
in
the
*NL*
hollow
between
two
snow-drifts
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
from
the
natural
prairie
to
a
cleared
district
which
twenty
*NL*
years
ago
had
been
forest
.
The
country
seemed
to
stretch
unchanging
to
*NL*
the
North
Pole
:
low
hill
,
brush-scraggly
bottom
,
reedy
creek
,
muskrat
*NL*
mound
,
fields
with
frozen
brown
clods
thrust
up
through
the
snow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
ears
and
nose
were
pinched
;
her
breath
frosted
her
collar
;
her
*NL*
fingers
ached
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Getting
colder
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
their
conversation
for
three
miles
.
Yet
she
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
Nels
Erdstrom
's
at
four
,
and
with
a
throb
she
recognized
*NL*
the
courageous
venture
which
had
lured
her
to
Gopher
Prairie
:
the
*NL*
cleared
fields
,
furrows
among
stumps
,
a
log
cabin
chinked
with
mud
and
*NL*
roofed
with
dry
hay
.
But
Nels
had
prospered
.
He
used
the
log
cabin
as
a
*NL*
barn
;
and
a
new
house
reared
up
,
a
proud
,
unwise
,
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
house
,
the
more
naked
and
ungraceful
in
its
glossy
white
paint
and
pink
*NL*
trimmings
.
Every
tree
had
been
cut
down
.
The
house
was
so
unsheltered
,
*NL*
so
battered
by
the
wind
,
so
bleakly
thrust
out
into
the
harsh
clearing
,
*NL*
that
Carol
shivered
.
But
they
were
welcomed
warmly
enough
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
with
its
crisp
new
plaster
,
its
black
and
nickel
range
,
its
*NL*
cream
separator
in
a
corner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Erdstrom
begged
her
to
sit
in
the
parlor
,
where
there
was
a
*NL*
phonograph
and
an
oak
and
leather
davenport
,
the
prairie
farmer
's
*NL*
proofs
of
social
progress
,
but
she
dropped
down
by
the
kitchen
stove
and
*NL*
insisted
,
``
Please
do
n't
mind
me
.
''
When
Mrs.
Erdstrom
had
followed
the
*NL*
doctor
out
of
the
room
Carol
glanced
in
a
friendly
way
at
the
grained
*NL*
pine
cupboard
,
the
framed
Lutheran
Konfirmations
Attest
,
the
traces
*NL*
of
fried
eggs
and
sausages
on
the
dining
table
against
the
wall
,
and
a
*NL*
jewel
among
calendars
,
presenting
not
only
a
lithographic
young
woman
*NL*
with
cherry
lips
,
and
a
Swedish
advertisement
of
Axel
Egge
's
grocery
,
*NL*
but
also
a
thermometer
and
a
match-holder
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
a
boy
of
four
or
five
was
staring
at
her
from
the
hall
,
*NL*
a
boy
in
gingham
shirt
and
faded
corduroy
trousers
,
but
large-eyed
,
*NL*
firm-mouthed
,
wide-browed
.
He
vanished
,
then
peeped
in
again
,
biting
his
*NL*
knuckles
,
turning
his
shoulder
toward
her
in
shyness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
n't
she
remember
--
what
was
it
?
--
Kennicott
sitting
beside
her
at
Fort
*NL*
Snelling
,
urging
,
``
See
how
scared
that
baby
is
.
Needs
some
woman
like
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Magic
had
fluttered
about
her
then
--
magic
of
sunset
and
cool
air
and
the
*NL*
curiosity
of
lovers
.
She
held
out
her
hands
as
much
to
that
sanctity
as
*NL*
to
the
boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
edged
into
the
room
,
doubtfully
sucking
his
thumb
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
,
''
she
said
.
``
What
's
your
name
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hee
,
hee
,
hee
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
quite
right
.
I
agree
with
you
.
Silly
people
like
me
always
ask
*NL*
children
their

*NL*
*NL*
``
Hee

*NL*
*NL*
``
Come

I
'll

know

will

about

but

will
have
a
slim
heroine
and
a
Prince
Charming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stood
stoically
while
she
spun
nonsense
.
His
giggling
ceased
.
She
was
*NL*
winning
him
.
Then
the
telephone
bell
--
two
long
rings
,
one
short
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Erdstrom
galloped
into
the
room
,
shrieked
into
the
transmitter
,
*NL*
``
Vell
?
Yes
,
yes
,
dis
is
Erdstrom

Heh

Oh

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
appeared
,
growled
into
the
telephone
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
what
do
you
want
?
Oh
,
hello

;
what

harness
up
and
take

surgical
kit
down
there

and
have

*NL*
take

chloroform

'll

home

*NL*
He
turned
to
Carol
.
``

miles
southwest

``

''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
's
bluffness
made
the
child
squirm
with
a
delight
which
Carol
*NL*
could
not
evoke
.
It
was
a
humble
wife
who
followed
the
busy
doctor
out
*NL*
to
the
carriage
,
and
her
ambition
was
not
to
play
Rachmaninoff
better
,
*NL*
nor
to
build
town
halls
,
but
to
chuckle
at
babies
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
sunset
was
merely
a
flush
of
rose
on
a
dome
of
silver
,
with
oak
*NL*
twigs
and
thin
poplar
branches
against
it
,
but
a
silo
on
the
horizon
*NL*
changed
from
a
red
tank
to
a
tower
of
violet
misted
over
with
gray
.
The
*NL*
purple
road
vanished
,
and
without
lights
,
in
the
darkness
of
a
world
*NL*
destroyed
,
they
swayed
on
--
toward
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
bumpy
cold
way
to
the
Morgenroth
farm
,
and
she
was
asleep
when
*NL*
they
arrived
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
no
glaring
new
house
with
a
proud
phonograph
,
but
a
low
*NL*
whitewashed
kitchen
smelling
of
cream
and
cabbage
.
Adolph
Morgenroth
was
*NL*
lying
on
a
couch
in
the
rarely
used
dining-room
.
His
heavy
work-scarred
*NL*
wife
was
shaking
her
hands
in
anxiety
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
felt
that
Kennicott
would
do
something
magnificent
and
startling
.
*NL*
But
he
was
casual
.
He
greeted
the
man
,
``
Well
,
well
,
Adolph
,
have
to
fix
*NL*
you
up
,
eh
?
''
Quietly
,
to
the
wife
,
``
Hat
die
drug
store

bag

So

haben

Got
any

that
good
beer
left
--

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
supped
in
four
minutes
.
His
coat
off
,
his
sleeves
rolled
up
,
he
*NL*
was
scrubbing
his
hands
in
a
tin
basin
in
the
sink
,
using
the
bar
of
*NL*
yellow
kitchen
soap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
not
dared
to
look
into
the
farther
room
while
she
labored
over
*NL*
the
supper
of
beer
,
rye
bread
,
moist
cornbeef
and
cabbage
,
set
on
the
*NL*
kitchen
table
.
The
man
in
there
was
groaning
.
In
her
one
glance
she
*NL*
had
seen
that
his
blue
flannel
shirt
was
open
at
a
corded
tobacco-brown
*NL*
neck
,
the
hollows
of
which
were
sprinkled
with
thin
black
and
gray
*NL*
hairs
.
He
was
covered
with
a
sheet
,
like
a
corpse
,
and
outside
the
sheet
*NL*
was
his
right
arm
,
wrapped
in
towels
stained
with
blood
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Kennicott
strode
into
the
other
room
gaily
,
and
she
followed
him
.
*NL*
With
surprising
delicacy
in
his
large
fingers
he
unwrapped
the
towels
*NL*
and
revealed
an
arm
which
,
below
the
elbow
,
was
a
mass
of
blood
and
raw
*NL*
flesh
.
The
man
bellowed
.
The
room
grew
thick
about
her
;
she
was
very
*NL*
seasick
;
she
fled
to
a
chair
in
the
kitchen
.
Through
the
haze
of
nausea
*NL*
she
heard
Kennicott
grumbling
,
``
Afraid
it
will
have
to
come
off
,
Adolph
.
*NL*
What
did
you
do
?
Fall
on
a
reaper
blade
?
We
'll
fix
it
right
up
.
Carrie
!
*NL*
CAROL
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
n't
--
she
could
n't
get
up
.
Then
she
was
up
,
her
knees
like
*NL*
water
,
her
stomach
revolving
a
thousand
times
a
second
,
her
eyes
filmed
,
*NL*
her
ears
full
of
roaring
.
She
could
n't
reach
the
dining-room
.
She
was
*NL*
going
to
faint
.
Then
she
was
in
the
dining-room
,
leaning
against
the
*NL*
wall
,
trying
to
smile
,
flushing
hot
and
cold
along
her
chest
and
sides
,
*NL*
while
Kennicott
mumbled
,
``
Say
,
help
Mrs.
Morgenroth
and
me
carry
him
*NL*
in
on
the
kitchen
table

No
,

out
and
shove
those
two
tables
*NL*
together
,
and
put
a
blanket
on
them
and
a
clean
sheet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
salvation
to
push
the
heavy
tables
,
to
scrub
them
,
to
be
exact
in
*NL*
placing
the
sheet
.
Her
head
cleared
;
she
was
able
to
look
calmly
in
at
*NL*
her
husband
and
the
farmwife
while
they
undressed
the
wailing
man
,
got
*NL*
him
into
a
clean
nightgown
,
and
washed
his
arm
.
Kennicott
came
to
lay
*NL*
out
his
instruments
.
She
realized
that
,
with
no
hospital
facilities
,
yet
*NL*
with
no
worry
about
it
,
her
husband
--
HER
HUSBAND
--
was
going
to
perform
*NL*
a
surgical
operation
,
that
miraculous
boldness
of
which
one
read
in
*NL*
stories
about
famous
surgeons
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
helped
them
to
move
Adolph
into
the
kitchen
.
The
man
was
in
such
a
*NL*
funk
that
he
would
not
use
his
legs
.
He
was
heavy
,
and
smelled
of
sweat
*NL*
and
the
stable
.
But
she
put
her
arm
about
his
waist
,
her
sleek
head
by
*NL*
his
chest
;
she
tugged
at
him
;
she
clicked
her
tongue
in
imitation
of
*NL*
Kennicott
's
cheerful
noises
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Adolph
was
on
the
table
Kennicott
laid
a
hemispheric
steel
and
*NL*
cotton
frame
on
his
face
;
suggested
to
Carol
,
``
Now
you
sit
here
at
his
*NL*
head
and
keep
the
ether
dripping
--
about
this
fast
,
see
?
I
'll
watch
*NL*
his
breathing
.
Look
who
's
here
!
Real
anesthetist
!
Ochsner
has
n't
got
a
*NL*
better
one
!
Class
,
eh
?
...
Now
,
now
,
Adolph
,
take
it
easy
.
This
wo
n't
*NL*
hurt
you
a
bit
.
Put
you
all
nice
and
asleep
and
it
wo
n't
hurt
a
bit
.
*NL*
Schweig
'
mal
!
Bald
schlaft
man
grat
wie
ein
Kind
.
So
!
So
!
Bald
geht
's
*NL*
besser
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
let
the
ether
drip
,
nervously
trying
to
keep
the
rhythm
that
*NL*
Kennicott
had
indicated
,
Carol
stared
at
her
husband
with
the
abandon
of
*NL*
hero-worship
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Bad
light
--
bad
light
.
Here
,
Mrs.
Morgenroth
,
you
*NL*
stand
right
here
and
hold
this
lamp
.
Hier
,
und
dieses
--
dieses
lamp
*NL*
halten
--
so
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
that
streaky
glimmer
he
worked
,
swiftly
,
at
ease
.
The
room
was
still
.
*NL*
Carol
tried
to
look
at
him
,
yet
not
look
at
the
seeping
blood
,
the
*NL*
crimson
slash
,
the
vicious
scalpel
.
The
ether
fumes
were
sweet
,
choking
.
*NL*
Her
head
seemed
to
be
floating
away
from
her
body
.
Her
arm
was
feeble
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
the
blood
but
the
grating
of
the
surgical
saw
on
the
living
*NL*
bone
that
broke
her
,
and
she
knew
that
she
had
been
fighting
off
nausea
,
*NL*
that
she
was
beaten
.
She
was
lost
in
dizziness
.
She
heard
Kennicott
's
*NL*
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sick
?
Trot
outdoors
couple
minutes
.
Adolph
will
stay
under
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
fumbling
at
a
door-knob
which
whirled
in
insulting
circles
;
*NL*
she
was
on
the
stoop
,
gasping
,
forcing
air
into
her
chest
,
her
head
*NL*
clearing
.
As
she
returned
she
caught
the
scene
as
a
whole
:
the
cavernous
*NL*
kitchen
,
two
milk-cans
a
leaden
patch
by
the
wall
,
hams
dangling
from
a
*NL*
beam
,
bats
of
light
at
the
stove
door
,
and
in
the
center
,
illuminated
*NL*
by
a
small
glass
lamp
held
by
a
frightened
stout
woman
,
Dr.
Kennicott
*NL*
bending
over
a
body
which
was
humped
under
a
sheet
--
the
surgeon
,
his
*NL*
bare
arms
daubed
with
blood
,
his
hands
,
in
pale-yellow
rubber
gloves
,
*NL*
loosening
the
tourniquet
,
his
face
without
emotion
save
when
he
threw
*NL*
up
his
head
and
clucked
at
the
farmwife
,
``
Hold
that
light
steady
just
a
*NL*
second
more
--
noch
blos
esn
wenig

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
speaks
a
vulgar
,
common
,
incorrect
German
of
life
and
death
and
*NL*
birth
and
the
soil
.
I
read
the
French
and
German
of
sentimental
*NL*
lovers
and
Christmas
garlands
.
And
I
thought
that
it
was
I
who
had
the
*NL*
culture
!
''
she
worshiped
as
she
returned
to
her
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
time
he
snapped
,
``
That
's
enough
.
Do
n't
give
him
any
more
ether
.
''
*NL*
He
was
concentrated
on
tying
an
artery
.
His
gruffness
seemed
heroic
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
shaped
the
flap
of
flesh
she
murmured
,
``
Oh
,
you
ARE
wonderful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
surprised
.
``
Why
,
this
is
a
cinch
.
Now
if
it
had
been
like
last
*NL*
week
--
Get
me
some
more
water
.
Now
last
week
I
had
a
case
with
an
ooze
*NL*
in
the
peritoneal
cavity
,
and
by
golly
if
it
was
n't
a
stomach
ulcer
that
*NL*
I
had
n't
suspected
and
--
There
.
Say
,
I
certainly
am
sleepy
.
Let
's
turn
*NL*
in
here
.
Too
late
to
drive

to
me
like
a

coming

They
slept
on
a
feather
bed
with
their
fur
coats
over
them
;
in
the
*NL*
morning
they
broke
ice
in
the
pitcher
--
the
vast
flowered
and
gilt
*NL*
pitcher
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
's
storm
had
not
come
.
When
they
set
out
it
was
hazy
and
*NL*
growing
warmer
.
After
a
mile
she
saw
that
he
was
studying
a
dark
cloud
*NL*
in
the
north
.
He
urged
the
horses
to
the
run
.
But
she
forgot
his
unusual
*NL*
haste
in
wonder
at
the
tragic
landscape
.
The
pale
snow
,
the
prickles
of
*NL*
old
stubble
,
and
the
clumps
of
ragged
brush
faded
into
a
gray
obscurity
.
*NL*
Under
the
hillocks
were
cold
shadows
.
The
willows
about
a
farmhouse
were
*NL*
agitated
by
the
rising
wind
,
and
the
patches
of
bare
wood
where
the
bark
*NL*
had
peeled
away
were
white
as
the
flesh
of
a
leper
.
The
snowy
slews
were
*NL*
of
a
harsh
flatness
.
The
whole
land
was
cruel
,
and
a
climbing
cloud
of
*NL*
slate-edged
blackness
dominated
the
sky
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guess
we
're
about
in
for
a
blizzard
,
''
speculated
Kennicott
``
We
can
make
*NL*
Ben
McGonegal
's
,
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Blizzard
?
Really
?
Why
--
But
still
we
used
to
think
they
were
fun
when
*NL*
I
was
a
girl
.
Daddy
had
to
stay
home
from
court
,
and
we
'd
stand
at
the
*NL*
window
and
watch
the
snow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
much
fun
on
the
prairie
.
Get
lost
.
Freeze
to
death
.
Take
no
*NL*
chances
.
''
He
chirruped
at
the
horses
.
They
were
flying
now
,
the
carriage
*NL*
rocking
on
the
hard
ruts
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
air
suddenly
crystallized
into
large
damp
flakes
.
The
horses
*NL*
and
the
buffalo
robe
were
covered
with
snow
;
her
face
was
wet
;
the
*NL*
thin
butt
of
the
whip
held
a
white
ridge
.
The
air
became
colder
.
The
*NL*
snowflakes
were
harder
;
they
shot
in
level
lines
,
clawing
at
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
see
a
hundred
feet
ahead
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
was
stern
.
He
bent
forward
,
the
reins
firm
in
his
coonskin
*NL*
gauntlets
.
She
was
certain
that
he
would
get
through
.
He
always
got
*NL*
through
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Save
for
his
presence
,
the
world
and
all
normal
living
disappeared
.
They
*NL*
were
lost
in
the
boiling
snow
.
He
leaned
close
to
bawl
,
``
Letting
the
*NL*
horses
have
their
heads
.
They
'll
get
us
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
terrifying
bump
they
were
off
the
road
,
slanting
with
two
wheels
*NL*
in
the
ditch
,
but
instantly
they
were
jerked
back
as
the
horses
fled
*NL*
on
.
She
gasped
.
She
tried
to
,
and
did
not
,
feel
brave
as
she
pulled
the
*NL*
woolen
robe
up
about
her
chin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
passing
something
like
a
dark
wall
on
the
right
.
``
I
know
that
*NL*
barn
!
''
he
yelped
.
He
pulled
at
the
reins
.
Peeping
from
the
covers
she
*NL*
saw
his
teeth
pinch
his
lower
lip
,
saw
him
scowl
as
he
slackened
and
*NL*
sawed
and
jerked
sharply
again
at
the
racing
horses
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
stopped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Farmhouse
there
.
Put
robe
around
you
and
come
on
,
''
he
cried
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
like
diving
into
icy
water
to
climb
out
of
the
carriage
,
but
*NL*
on
the
ground
she
smiled
at
him
,
her
face
little
and
childish
and
pink
*NL*
above
the
buffalo
robe
over
her
shoulders
.
In
a
swirl
of
flakes
which
*NL*
scratched
at
their
eyes
like
a
maniac
darkness
,
he
unbuckled
the
*NL*
harness
.
He
turned
and
plodded
back
,
a
ponderous
furry
figure
,
holding
*NL*
the
horses
'
bridles
,
Carol
's
hand
dragging
at
his
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
came
to
the
cloudy
bulk
of
a
barn
whose
outer
wall
was
directly
*NL*
upon
the
road
.
Feeling
along
it
,
he
found
a
gate
,
led
them
into
a
yard
,
*NL*
into
the
barn
.
The
interior
was
warm
.
It
stunned
them
with
its
languid
*NL*
quiet
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
carefully
drove
the
horses
into
stalls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
toes
were
coals
of
pain
.
``
Let
's
run
for
the
house
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ca
n't
.
Not
yet
.
Might
never
find
it

Might
get
lost
ten
feet
away
from

it

Sit
over
in
this
stall
,
near
the
horses
.
We
'll
rush
for
the
house

when
the
blizzard
lifts

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
so
stiff
!
I
ca
n't
walk

*NL*
*NL*
He
carried
her
into
the
stall
,
stripped
off
her
overshoes
and
boots
,
*NL*
stopping
to
blow
on
his
purple
fingers
as
he
fumbled
at
her
laces
.
*NL*
He
rubbed
her
feet
,
and
covered
her
with
the
buffalo
robe
and
*NL*
horse-blankets
from
the
pile
on
the
feed-box
.
She
was
drowsy
,
hemmed
in
*NL*
by
the
storm
.
She
sighed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
so
strong
and
yet
so
skilful
and
not
afraid
of
blood
or
storm
*NL*
or
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Used
to
it

Only
thing
that
's
bothered
me
was
the
chance

ether

fumes
might
explode

last
night

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do

understand

``
Why

Dave
,
the
darn
fool

sent
me
ether

instead

chloroform

told

and
you
know
ether
fumes
are
mighty
inflammable

especially
*NL*
with
that
lamp
right
by
the
table

But
I
had

chuck-full

barnyard
filth

``
You

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
KENNICOTT
was
heavily
pleased
by
her
Christmas
presents
,
and
he
gave
her
*NL*
a
diamond
bar-pin
.
But
she
could
not
persuade
herself
that
he
was
much
*NL*
interested
in
the
rites
of
the
morning
,
in
the
tree
she
had
decorated
,
*NL*
the
three
stockings
she
had
hung
,
the
ribbons
and
gilt
seals
and
hidden
*NL*
messages
.
He
said
only
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nice
way
to
fix
things
,
all
right
.
What
do
you
say
we
go
down
to
Jack
*NL*
Elder
's
and
have
a
game
of
five
hundred
this
afternoon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
her
father
's
Christmas
fantasies
:
the
sacred
old
rag
*NL*
doll
at
the
top
of
the
tree
,
the
score
of
cheap
presents
,
the
punch
and
*NL*
carols
,
the
roast
chestnuts
by
the
fire
,
and
the
gravity
with
which
the
*NL*
judge
opened
the
children
's
scrawly
notes
and
took
cognizance
of
demands
*NL*
for
sled-rides
,
for
opinions
upon
the
existence
of
Santa
Claus
.
She
*NL*
remembered
him
reading
out
a
long
indictment
of
himself
for
being
a
*NL*
sentimentalist
,
against
the
peace
and
dignity
of
the
State
of
Minnesota
.
*NL*
She
remembered
his
thin
legs
twinkling
before
their
sled
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
muttered
unsteadily
,
``
Must
run
up
and
put
on
my
shoes
--
slippers
so
*NL*
cold
.
''
In
the
not
very
romantic
solitude
of
the
locked
bathroom
she
sat
*NL*
on
the
slippery
edge
of
the
tub
and
wept
.

II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
five
hobbies
:
medicine
,
land-investment
,
Carol
,
motoring
,
*NL*
and
hunting
.
It
is
not
certain
in
what
order
he
preferred
them
.
Solid
*NL*
though
his
enthusiasms
were
in
the
matter
of
medicine
--
his
admiration
*NL*
of
this
city
surgeon
,
his
condemnation
of
that
for
tricky
ways
of
*NL*
persuading
country
practitioners
to
bring
in
surgical
patients
,
*NL*
his
indignation
about
fee-splitting
,
his
pride
in
a
new
X-ray
*NL*
apparatus
--
none
of
these
beatified
him
as
did
motoring
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
nursed
his
two-year-old
Buick
even
in
winter
,
when
it
was
stored
in
*NL*
the
stable-garage
behind
the
house
.
He
filled
the
grease-cups
,
varnished
*NL*
a
fender
,
removed
from
beneath
the
back
seat
the
debris
of
gloves
,
*NL*
copper
washers
,
crumpled
maps
,
dust
,
and
greasy
rags
.
Winter
noons
he
*NL*
wandered
out
and
stared
owlishly
at
the
car
.
He
became
excited
over
a
*NL*
fabulous
``
trip
we
might
take
next
summer
.
''
He
galloped
to
the
station
,
*NL*
brought
home
railway
maps
,
and
traced
motor-routes
from
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
to
Winnipeg
or
Des
Moines
or
Grand
Marais
,
thinking
aloud
and
expecting
*NL*
her
to
be
effusive
about
such
academic
questions
as
``
Now
I
wonder
if
we

could
stop
at

break
the
jump

*NL*
*NL*
To
him
motoring
was
a
faith
not
to
be
questioned
,
a
high-church
cult
,
*NL*
with
electric
sparks
for
candles
,
and
piston-rings
possessing
the
*NL*
sanctity
of
altar-vessels
.
His
liturgy
was
composed
of
intoned
and
*NL*
metrical
road-comments
:
``
They
say
there
's
a
pretty
good
hike
from
Duluth
*NL*
to
International
Falls
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hunting
was
equally
a
devotion
,
full
of
metaphysical
concepts
veiled
*NL*
from
Carol
.
All
winter
he
read
sporting-catalogues
,
and
thought
about
*NL*
remarkable
past
shots
:
''
`
Member
that
time
when
I
got
two
ducks
on
a
*NL*
long
chance
,
just
at
sunset
?
''
At
least
once
a
month
he
drew
his
favorite
*NL*
repeating
shotgun
,
his
``
pump
gun
,
''
from
its
wrapper
of
greased
canton
*NL*
flannel
;
he
oiled
the
trigger
,
and
spent
silent
ecstatic
moments
aiming
*NL*
at
the
ceiling
.
Sunday
mornings
Carol
heard
him
trudging
up
to
the
*NL*
attic
and
there
,
an
hour
later
,
she
found
him
turning
over
boots
,
wooden
*NL*
duck-decoys
,
lunch-boxes
,
or
reflectively
squinting
at
old
shells
,
*NL*
rubbing
their
brass
caps
with
his
sleeve
and
shaking
his
head
as
he
*NL*
thought
about
their
uselessness
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kept
the
loading-tools
he
had
used
as
a
boy
:
a
capper
for
shot-gun
*NL*
shells
,
a
mold
for
lead
bullets
.
When
once
,
in
a
housewifely
frenzy
for
*NL*
getting
rid
of
things
,
she
raged
,
``
Why
do
n't
you
give
these
away
?
''
he
*NL*
solemnly
defended
them
,
``
Well
,
you
ca
n't
tell
;
they
might
come
in
handy
*NL*
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
flushed
.
She
wondered
if
he
was
thinking
of
the
child
they
would
*NL*
have
when
,
as
he
put
it
,
they
were
``
sure
they
could
afford
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mysteriously
aching
,
nebulously
sad
,
she
slipped
away
,
half-convinced
*NL*
but
only
half-convinced
that
it
was
horrible
and
unnatural
,
this
*NL*
postponement
of
release
of
mother-affection
,
this
sacrifice
to
her
*NL*
opinionation
and
to
his
cautious
desire
for
prosperity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
would
be
worse
if
he
were
like
Sam
Clark
--
insisted
on
having
*NL*
children
,
''
she
considered
;
then
,
``
If
Will
were
the
Prince
,
would
n't
I
*NL*
DEMAND
his
child
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
's
land-deals
were
both
financial
advancement
and
favorite
*NL*
game
.
Driving
through
the
country
,
he
noticed
which
farms
had
good
*NL*
crops
;
he
heard
the
news
about
the
restless
farmer
who
was
``
thinking
*NL*
about
selling
out
here
and
pulling
his
freight
for
Alberta
.
''
He
asked
*NL*
the
veterinarian
about
the
value
of
different
breeds
of
stock
;
he
*NL*
inquired
of
Lyman
Cass
whether
or
not
Einar
Gyseldson
really
had
had
a
*NL*
yield
of
forty
bushels
of
wheat
to
the
acre
.
He
was
always
consulting
*NL*
Julius
Flickerbaugh
,
who
handled
more
real
estate
than
law
,
and
more
law
*NL*
than
justice
.
He
studied
township
maps
,
and
read
notices
of
auctions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
he
was
able
to
buy
a
quarter-section
of
land
for
one
hundred
and
*NL*
fifty
dollars
an
acre
,
and
to
sell
it
in
a
year
or
two
,
after
installing
*NL*
a
cement
floor
in
the
barn
and
running
water
in
the
house
,
for
one
*NL*
hundred
and
eighty
or
even
two
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
spoke
of
these
details
to
Sam
Clark
...
rather
often
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
all
his
games
,
cars
and
guns
and
land
,
he
expected
Carol
to
take
an
*NL*
interest
.
But
he
did
not
give
her
the
facts
which
might
have
created
*NL*
interest
.
He
talked
only
of
the
obvious
and
tedious
aspects
;
never
of
*NL*
his
aspirations
in
finance
,
nor
of
the
mechanical
principles
of
motors
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
month
of
romance
she
was
eager
to
understand
his
hobbies
.
She
*NL*
shivered
in
the
garage
while
he
spent
half
an
hour
in
deciding
whether
*NL*
to
put
alcohol
or
patent
non-freezing
liquid
into
the
radiator
,
or
to
*NL*
drain
out
the
water
entirely
.
``
Or
no
,
then
I
would
n't
want
to
take
*NL*
her
out
if
it
turned
warm
--
still
,
of
course
,
I
could
fill
the
*NL*
radiator
again
--
would
n't
take
so
awful
long
--
just
take
a
few
pails
*NL*
of
water
--
still
,
if
it
turned
cold
on
me
again
before
I
drained
*NL*
it
--
Course
there
's
some
people
that
put
in
kerosene
,
but
they
say
it
*NL*
rots
the
hose-connections
and
--
Where
did
I
put
that
lug-wrench
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
this
point
that
she
gave
up
being
a
motorist
and
retired
to
*NL*
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
new
intimacy
he
was
more
communicative
about
his
practise
;
*NL*
he
informed
her
,
with
the
invariable
warning
not
to
tell
,
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Sunderquist
had
another
baby
coming
,
that
the
``
hired
girl
at
Howland
's
*NL*
was
in
trouble
.
''
But
when
she
asked
technical
questions
he
did
not
know
*NL*
how
to
answer
;
when
she
inquired
,
``
Exactly
what
is
the
method
of
taking
*NL*
out
the
tonsils
?
''
he
yawned
,
``
Tonsilectomy

there
's

They
had
gone
to
the
``
movies
.
''
The
movies
were
almost
as
vital
*NL*
to
Kennicott
and
the
other
solid
citizens
of
Gopher
Prairie
as
*NL*
land-speculation
and
guns

The
feature
film
portrayed
a
brave
young
Yankee
who
conquered
a
South
*NL*
American
republic
.
He
turned
the
natives
from
their
barbarous
habits
of
*NL*
singing
and
laughing
to
the
vigorous
sanity
,
the
Pep
and
Punch
and
*NL*
Go
,
of
the
North
;
he
taught
them
to
work
in
factories
,
to
wear
Klassy
*NL*
Kollege
Klothes
,
and
to
shout
,
``
Oh
,
you
baby
doll
,
watch
me
gather
*NL*
in
the
mazuma
.
''
He
changed
nature
itself
.
A
mountain
which
had
borne
*NL*
nothing
but
lilies
and
cedars
and
loafing
clouds
was
by
his
Hustle
so
*NL*
inspirited
that
it
broke
out
in
long
wooden
sheds
,
and
piles
of
iron
*NL*
ore
to
be
converted
into
steamers
to
carry
iron
ore

The
intellectual
tension
induced
by
the
master
film
was
relieved
by
a
*NL*
livelier
,
more
lyric
and
less
philosophical
drama
:
Mack
Schnarken
and
*NL*
the
Bathing
Suit
Babes
in
a
comedy
of
manners
entitled
``
Right
on
the
*NL*
Coco
.
''
Mr.
Schnarken
was
at
various
high
moments
a
cook
,
a
life-guard
,
*NL*
a
burlesque
actor
,
and
a
sculptor
.
There
was
a
hotel
hallway
up
which
*NL*
policemen
charged
,
only
to
be
stunned
by
plaster
busts
hurled
upon
them
*NL*
from
the
innumerous
doors
.
If
the
plot
lacked
lucidity
,
the
dual
motif
*NL*
of
legs
and
pie
was
clear
and
sure
.
Bathing
and
modeling
were
equally
*NL*
sound
occasions
for
legs
;
the
wedding-scene
was
but
an
approach
to
the
*NL*
thunderous
climax
when
Mr.
Schnarken
slipped
a
piece
of
custard
pie
into
*NL*
the
clergyman
's
rear
pocket
.

audience
in

overshoes

*NL*

the

announced
that

stooped
before

was
torturing
the
barren
street

was

his

meditated
upon

patois

the
Boeotian

characteristic
of

He

laughed
puzzlingly

came
into

again

the
eighth
,
''
while
Carol
sat
beside
Guy
at
the
dining
table
,
buttering
*NL*
pop-corn
.
She
was
quickened
by
the
speculation
in
his
eyes
.
She
*NL*
murmured
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Guy
,
do
you
want
to
help
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
!
How
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
I
want
you
to
help
me
find
out
what
has
made
the
darkness
of
*NL*
the
women
.
Gray
darkness
and
shadowy
trees
.
We
're
all
in
it
,
ten
million
*NL*
women
,
young
married
women
with
good
prosperous
husbands
,
and
business
*NL*
women
in
linen
collars
,
and
grandmothers
that
gad
out
to
teas
,
and
wives
*NL*
of
under-paid
miners
,
and
farmwives
who
really
like
to
make
butter
and
*NL*
go
to
church
.
What
is
it
we
want
--
and
need
?
Will
Kennicott
there
would
*NL*
say
that
we
need
lots
of
children
and
hard
work
.
But
it
is
n't
that
.
*NL*
There
's
the
same
discontent
in
women
with
eight
children
and
one
more
*NL*
coming
--
always
one
more
coming
!
And
you
find
it
in
stenographers
and
*NL*
wives
who
scrub
,
just
as
much
as
in
girl
college-graduates
who
wonder
*NL*
how
they
can
escape
their
kind
parents
.
What
do
we
want
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Essentially
,
I
think
,
you
are
like
myself
,
Carol
;
you
want
to
go
back
*NL*
to
an
age
of
tranquillity
and
charming
manners
.
You
want
to
enthrone
*NL*
good
taste
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Just
good
taste
?
Fastidious
people
?
Oh
--
no
!
I
believe
all
of
us
want
*NL*
the
same
things
--
we
're
all
together
,
the
industrial
workers
and
the
*NL*
women
and
the
farmers
and
the
negro
race
and
the
Asiatic
colonies
,
and
*NL*
even
a
few
of
the
Respectables
.
It
's
all
the
same
revolt
,
in
all
the
*NL*
classes
that
have
waited
and
taken
advice
.
I
think
perhaps
we
want
a
*NL*
more
conscious
life
.
We
're
tired
of
drudging
and
sleeping
and
dying
.
*NL*
We
're
tired
of
seeing
just
a
few
people
able
to
be
individualists
.
We
're
*NL*
tired
of
always
deferring
hope
till
the
next
generation
.
We
're
tired
*NL*
of
hearing
the
politicians
and
priests
and
cautious
reformers
-LRB-
and
the
*NL*
husbands
!
-RRB-
coax
us
,
`
Be
calm
!
Be
patient
!
Wait
!
We
have
the
plans
for
a
*NL*
Utopia
already
made
;
just
give
us
a
bit
more
time
and
we
'll
produce
it
;
*NL*
trust
us
;
we
're
wiser
than
you
.
'
For
ten
thousand
years
they
've
said
*NL*
that
.
We
want
our
Utopia
NOW
--
and
we
're
going
to
try
our
hands
at
it
.
*NL*
All
we
want
is
--
everything
for
all
of
us
!
For
every
housewife
and
every
*NL*
longshoreman
and
every
Hindu
nationalist
and
every
teacher

We
want
*NL*
everything

We
shat
n't

it

So
we

ever
be
content

She
wondered
why
he
was
wincing
.
He
broke
in
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
See
here
,
my
dear
,
I
certainly
hope
you
do
n't
class
yourself
with
a
lot
*NL*
of
trouble-making
labor-leaders
!
Democracy
is
all
right
theoretically
,
*NL*
and
I
'll
admit
there
are
industrial
injustices
,
but
I
'd
rather
have
them
*NL*
than
see
the
world
reduced
to
a
dead
level
of
mediocrity
.
I
refuse
to
*NL*
believe
that
you
have
anything
in
common
with
a
lot
of
laboring
men
*NL*
rowing
for
bigger
wages
so
that
they
can
buy
wretched
flivvers
and
*NL*
hideous
player-pianos
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
this
second
,
in
Buenos
Ayres
,
a
newspaper
editor
broke
his
routine
of
*NL*
being
bored
by
exchanges
to
assert
,
``
Any
injustice
is
better
than
seeing
*NL*
the
world
reduced
to
a
gray
level
of
scientific
dullness
.
''
At
this
*NL*
second
a
clerk
standing
at
the
bar
of
a
New
York
saloon
stopped
milling
*NL*
his
secret
fear
of
his
nagging
office-manager
long
enough
to
growl
*NL*
at
the
chauffeur
beside
him
,
``
Aw
,
you
socialists
make
me
sick
!
I
'm
an
*NL*
individualist
.
I
ai
n't
going
to
be
nagged
by
no
bureaus
and
take
orders
*NL*
off
labor-leaders

And
mean
to
say
a
hobo
's
as
good
as
you
and
me
?

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
second
Carol
realized
that
for
all
Guy
's
love
of
dead
elegances
*NL*
his
timidity
was
as
depressing
to
her
as
the
bulkiness
of
Sam
Clark
.
She
*NL*
realized
that
he
was
not
a
mystery
,
as
she
had
excitedly
believed
;
not
*NL*
a
romantic
messenger
from
the
World
Outside
on
whom
she
could
count
for
*NL*
escape
.
He
belonged
to
Gopher
Prairie
,
absolutely
.
She
was
snatched
back
*NL*
from
a
dream
of
far
countries
,
and
found
herself
on
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
completing
his
protest
,
``
You
do
n't
want
to
be
mixed
up
in
all
*NL*
this
orgy
of
meaningless
discontent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
soothed
him
.
``
No
,
I
do
n't
.
I
'm
not
heroic
.
I
'm
scared
by
all
the
*NL*
fighting
that
's
going
on
in
the
world
.
I
want
nobility
and
adventure
,
*NL*
but
perhaps
I
want
still
more
to
curl
on
the
hearth
with
some
one
I
*NL*
love

*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
finish
it
.
He
picked
up
a
handful
of
pop-corn
,
let
it
run
*NL*
through
his
fingers
,
looked
at
her
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
loneliness
of
one
who
has
put
away
a
possible
love
Carol
saw
*NL*
that
he
was
a
stranger
.
She
saw
that
he
had
never
been
anything
but
*NL*
a
frame
on
which
she
had
hung
shining
garments
.
If
she
had
let
him
*NL*
diffidently
make
love
to
her
,
it
was
not
because
she
cared
,
but
because
*NL*
she
did
not
care
,
because
it
did
not
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
at
him
with
the
exasperating
tactfulness
of
a
woman
checking
*NL*
a
flirtation
;
a
smile
like
an
airy
pat
on
the
arm
.
She
sighed
,
``
You
're
*NL*
a
dear
to
let
me
tell
you
my
imaginary
troubles
.
''
She
bounced
up
,
and
*NL*
trilled
,
``
Shall
we
take
the
pop-corn
in
to
them
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
looked
after
her
desolately
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
teased
Vida
and
Kennicott
she
was
repeating
,
``
I
must
go
on

*NL*

VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
Bjornstam
,
the
pariah
``
Red
Swede
,
''
had
brought
his
circular
saw
*NL*
and
portable
gasoline
engine
to
the
house
,
to
cut
the
cords
of
poplar
*NL*
for
the
kitchen
range
.
Kennicott
had
given
the
order
;
Carol
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
it
till
she
heard
the
ringing
of
the
saw
,
and
glanced
out
to
see
*NL*
Bjornstam
,
in
black
leather
jacket
and
enormous
ragged
purple
*NL*
mittens
,
pressing
sticks
against
the
whirling
blade
,
and
flinging
*NL*
the
stove-lengths
to
one
side
.
The
red
irritable
motor
kept
up
a
red
*NL*
irritable
``
tip-tip-tip-tip-tip-tip
.
''
The
whine
of
the
saw
rose
till
it
*NL*
simulated
the
shriek
of
a
fire-alarm
whistle
at
night
,
but
always
at
the
*NL*
end
it
gave
a
lively
metallic
clang
,
and
in
the
stillness
she
heard
the
*NL*
flump
of
the
cut
stick
falling
on
the
pile
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
a
motor
robe
over
her
,
ran
out
.
Bjornstam
welcomed
her
,
``
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
well
!
Here
's
old
Miles
,
fresh
as
ever
.
Well
say
,
that
's
all
right
;
*NL*
he
ai
n't
even
begun
to
be
cheeky
yet
;
next
summer
he
's
going
to
take
you
*NL*
out
on
his
horse-trading
trip
,
clear
into
Idaho
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
may
go
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
tricks
?
Crazy
about
the
town
yet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
I
probably
shall
be
,
some
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
'em
get
you
.
Kick
'em
in
the
face
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
shouted
at
her
while
he
worked
.
The
pile
of
stove-wood
grew
*NL*
astonishingly
.
The
pale
bark
of
the
poplar
sticks
was
mottled
with
*NL*
lichens
of
sage-green
and
dusty
gray
;
the
newly
sawed
ends
were
*NL*
fresh-colored
,
with
the
agreeable
roughness
of
a
woolen
muffler
.
To
the
*NL*
sterile
winter
air
the
wood
gave
a
scent
of
March
sap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
telephoned
that
he
was
going
into
the
country
.
Bjornstam
had
*NL*
not
finished
his
work
at
noon
,
and
she
invited
him
to
have
dinner
with
*NL*
Bea
in
the
kitchen
.
She
wished
that
she
were
independent
enough
to
dine
*NL*
with
these
her
guests
.
She
considered
their
friendliness
,
she
sneered
at
*NL*
``
social
distinctions
,
''
she
raged
at
her
own
taboos
--
and
she
continued
*NL*
to
regard
them
as
retainers
and
herself
as
a
lady
.
She
sat
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
and
listened
through
the
door
to
Bjornstam
's
booming
and
*NL*
Bea
's
giggles
.
She
was
the
more
absurd
to
herself
in
that
,
after
the
*NL*
rite
of
dining
alone
,
she
could
go
out
to
the
kitchen
,
lean
against
the
*NL*
sink
,
and
talk
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
attracted
to
each
other
;
a
Swedish
Othello
and
Desdemona
,
more
*NL*
useful
and
amiable
than
their
prototypes
.
Bjornstam
told
his
scapes
:
*NL*
selling
horses
in
a
Montana
mining-camp
,
breaking
a
log-jam
,
being
*NL*
impertinent
to
a
``
two-fisted
''
millionaire
lumberman
.
Bea
gurgled
``
Oh
*NL*
my
!
''
and
kept
his
coffee
cup
filled
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
took
a
long
time
to
finish
the
wood
.
He
had
frequently
to
go
into
the
*NL*
kitchen
to
get
warm
.
Carol
heard
him
confiding
to
Bea
,
``
You
're
a
darn
*NL*
nice
Swede
girl
.
I
guess
if
I
had
a
woman
like
you
I
would
n't
be
such
*NL*
a
sorehead
.
Gosh
,
your
kitchen
is
clean
;
makes
an
old
bach
feel
sloppy
.
*NL*
Say
,
that
's
nice
hair
you
got
.
Huh
?
Me
fresh
?
Saaaay
,
girl
,
if
I
ever
do
*NL*
get
fresh
,
you
'll
know
it
.
Why
,
I
could
pick
you
up
with
one
finger
,
*NL*
and
hold
you
in
the
air
long
enough
to
read
Robert
J.
Ingersoll
clean
*NL*
through
.
Ingersoll
?
Oh
,
he
's
a
religious
writer
.
Sure
.
You
'd
like
him
*NL*
fine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
he
drove
off
he
waved
to
Bea
;
and
Carol
,
lonely
at
the
window
*NL*
above
,
was
envious
of
their
pastoral
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I

But
I
will
go
on

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THEY
were
driving
down
the
lake
to
the
cottages
that
moonlit
January
*NL*
night
,
twenty
of
them
in
the
bob-sled
.
They
sang
``
Toy
Land
''
and
``
Seeing
*NL*
Nelly
Home
''
;
they
leaped
from
the
low
back
of
the
sled
to
race
over
the
*NL*
slippery
snow
ruts
;
and
when
they
were
tired
they
climbed
on
the
runners
*NL*
for
a
lift
.
The
moon-tipped
flakes
kicked
up
by
the
horses
settled
over
*NL*
the
revelers
and
dripped
down
their
necks
,
but
they
laughed
,
yelped
,
*NL*
beat
their
leather
mittens
against
their
chests
.
The
harness
rattled
,
*NL*
the
sleigh-bells
were
frantic
,
Jack
Elder
's
setter
sprang
beside
the
*NL*
horses
,
barking
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
time
Carol
raced
with
them
.
The
cold
air
gave
fictive
power
.
She
*NL*
felt
that
she
could
run
on
all
night
,
leap
twenty
feet
at
a
stride
.
But
*NL*
the
excess
of
energy
tired
her
,
and
she
was
glad
to
snuggle
under
the
*NL*
comforters
which
covered
the
hay
in
the
sled-box
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
midst
of
the
babel
she
found
enchanted
quietude
.
*NL*
*NL*
Along
the
road
the
shadows
from
oak-branches
were
inked
on
the
snow
*NL*
like
bars
of
music
.
Then
the
sled
came
out
on
the
surface
of
Lake
*NL*
Minniemashie
.
Across
the
thick
ice
was
a
veritable
road
,
a
short-cut
*NL*
for
farmers
.
On
the
glaring
expanse
of
the
lake-levels
of
hard
crust
,
*NL*
flashes
of
green
ice
blown
clear
,
chains
of
drifts
ribbed
like
the
*NL*
sea-beach
--
the
moonlight
was
overwhelming
.
It
stormed
on
the
snow
,
it
*NL*
turned
the
woods
ashore
into
crystals
of
fire
.
The
night
was
tropical
*NL*
and
voluptuous
.
In
that
drugged
magic
there
was
no
difference
between
*NL*
heavy
heat
and
insinuating
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
dream-strayed
.
The
turbulent
voices
,
even
Guy
Pollock
being
*NL*
connotative
beside
her
,
were
nothing
.
She
repeated
:
*NL*
*NL*
Deep
on
the
convent-roof
the
snows
*NL*
Are
sparkling
to
the
moon
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
words
and
the
light
blurred
into
one
vast
indefinite
happiness
,
and
*NL*
she
believed
that
some
great
thing
was
coming
to
her
.
She
withdrew
from
*NL*
the
clamor
into
a
worship
of
incomprehensible
gods
.
The
night
expanded
,
*NL*
she
was
conscious
of
the
universe
,
and
all
mysteries
stooped
down
to
*NL*
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
jarred
out
of
her
ecstasy
as
the
bob-sled
bumped
up
the
steep
*NL*
road
to
the
bluff
where
stood
the
cottages
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dismounted
at
Jack
Elder
's
shack
.
The
interior
walls
of
unpainted
*NL*
boards
,
which
had
been
grateful
in
August
,
were
forbidding
in
the
chill
.
*NL*
In
fur
coats
and
mufflers
tied
over
caps
they
were
a
strange
company
,
*NL*
bears
and
walruses
talking
.
Jack
Elder
lighted
the
shavings
waiting
in
*NL*
the
belly
of
a
cast-iron
stove
which
was
like
an
enlarged
bean-pot
.
*NL*
They
piled
their
wraps
high
on
a
rocker
,
and
cheered
the
rocker
as
it
*NL*
solemnly
tipped
over

Mrs.

Mrs.

made
coffee
in
an
enormous
blackened

Vida
Sherwin

unpacked
doughnuts

Mrs.

warmed
up

a

*NL*
*NL*
The
others
danced
,
muttering
``
Ouch
!
''
as
their
frosted
feet
struck
the
*NL*
pine
planks
.
Carol
had
lost
her
dream
.
Harry
Haydock
lifted
her
by
the
*NL*
waist
and
swung
her
.
She
laughed
.
The
gravity
of
the
people
who
stood
*NL*
apart
and
talked
made
her
the
more
impatient
for
frolic
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
,
Sam
Clark
,
Jackson
Elder
,
young
Dr.
McGanum
,
and
James
*NL*
Madison
Howland
,
teetering
on
their
toes
near
the
stove
,
conversed
*NL*
with
the
sedate
pomposity
of
the
commercialist
.
In
details
the
men
were
*NL*
unlike
,
yet
they
said
the
same
things
in
the
same
hearty
monotonous
*NL*
voices
.
You
had
to
look
at
them
to
see
which
was
speaking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
we
made
pretty
good
time
coming
up
,
''
from
one
--
any
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yump

we
hit
it
up
after

struck
the

going

*NL*
*NL*
``
Seems
kind

*NL*
*NL*
``

it

at
that

you

out

you
got
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Seems
to
hold
out
fine

Still
,
I
do
n't

like
it
any

the
Roadeater
Cord

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yump
,
nothing
better
than
a
Roadeater

Especially
the

The
cord
's
*NL*
lots
better

the
fabric

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yump
,
you
said
something

a
good

*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
how
'd
you
come
out
with
Pete
Garsheim
on
his
payments
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
paying
up
pretty
good

*NL*
``

*NL*
They
glided
from
these
serious
topics
into
the
jocose
insults
which
are
*NL*
the
wit
of
Main
Street
.
Sam
Clark
was
particularly
apt
at
them
.
``
What
's
*NL*
this
wild-eyed
sale
of
summer
caps
you
think
you
're
trying

off

he
clamored
at
Harry
Haydock
.
``
Did
you
steal
'em

are
you
just

overcharging
us

as

speaking
about
caps
,
d'
I
ever
*NL*
tell
you
the
good

The

good

he
thinks
he

almost
got
human
intelligence

one

time
he
had
his
machine
out
in
the
rain

and
the
poor
fish

he
had
n't
*NL*
put
on
chains
,
and
thinks
I
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
heard
the
story
rather
often
.
She
fled
back
to
the
dancers
,
*NL*
and
at
Dave
Dyer
's
masterstroke
of
dropping
an
icicle
down
Mrs.
*NL*
McGanum
's
back
she
applauded
hysterically
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
on
the
floor
,
devouring
the
food
.
The
men
giggled
amiably
as
*NL*
they
passed
the
whisky
bottle
,
and
laughed
,
``
There
's
a
real
sport
!
''
when
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
took
a
sip
.
Carol
tried
to
follow
;
she
believed
that
she
*NL*
desired
to
be
drunk
and
riotous
;
but
the
whisky
choked
her
and
as
she
*NL*
saw
Kennicott
frown
she
handed
the
bottle
on
repentantly
.
Somewhat
too
*NL*
late
she
remembered
that
she
had
given
up
domesticity
and
repentance
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
play
charades
!
''
said
Raymie
Wutherspoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
do
let
us
,
''
said
Ella
Stowbody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
caper
,
''
sanctioned
Harry
Haydock
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
interpreted
the
word
``
making
''
as
May
and
King
.
The
crown
was
a
red
*NL*
flannel
mitten
cocked
on
Sam
Clark
's
broad
pink
bald
head
.
They
forgot
*NL*
they
were
respectable
.
They
made-believe
.
Carol
was
stimulated
to
cry
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
form
a
dramatic
club
and
give
a
play
!
Shall
we
?
It
's
been
so
much
*NL*
fun
tonight
!

*NL*
*NL*
They
looked
affable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
,
''
observed
Sam
Clark
loyally
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
let
us
!
I
think
it
would
be
lovely
to
present

Romeo

yearned
Ella
Stowbody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Be
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
fun
,
''
Dr.
Terry
Gould
granted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
we
did
,
''
Carol
cautioned
,
``
it
would
be
awfully
silly
to
have
*NL*
amateur
theatricals

We
ought
to
paint
our
own
scenery

everything
,
*NL*
and
really
do
something
fine

There

be
a
lot
of
hard
work

Would
*NL*
you
--
would
we
all
be
punctual
at

do
you
suppose
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
bet
!
''
``
Sure

''
``
That
's
the
idea
.
''
``
Fellow
ought
to
be
prompt
at
*NL*
rehearsals

''
they
all
agreed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
's
meet
next
week
and
form
the
Gopher
Prairie
Dramatic
*NL*
Association
!
''
Carol
sang
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
drove
home
loving
these
friends
who
raced
through
moonlit
snow
,
*NL*
had
Bohemian
parties
,
and
were
about
to
create
beauty
in
the
theater
.
*NL*
Everything
was
solved
.
She
would
be
an
authentic
part
of
the
town
,
*NL*
yet
escape
the
coma
of
the
Village
Virus
...
She
would
be
free
of
*NL*
Kennicott
again
,
without
hurting
him
,
without
his
knowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
triumphed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moon
was
small
and
high
now
,
and
unheeding
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Though
they
had
all
been
certain
that
they
longed
for
the
privilege
of
*NL*
attending
committee
meetings
and
rehearsals
,
the
dramatic
association
as
*NL*
definitely
formed
consisted
only
of
Kennicott
,
Carol
,
Guy
Pollock
,
*NL*
Vida
Sherwin
,
Ella
Stowbody
,
the
Harry
Haydocks
,
the
Dave
Dyers
,
Raymie
*NL*
Wutherspoon
,
Dr.
Terry
Gould
,
and
four
new
candidates
:
flirtatious
Rita
*NL*
Simons
,
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Harvey
Dillon
and
Myrtle
Cass
,
an
uncomely
but
*NL*
intense
girl
of
nineteen
.
Of
these
fifteen
only
seven
came
to
the
first
*NL*
meeting
.
The
rest
telephoned
their
unparalleled
regrets
and
engagements
*NL*
and
illnesses
,
and
announced
that
they
would
be
present
at
all
other
*NL*
meetings
through
eternity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
made
president
and
director
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
added
the
Dillons
.
Despite
Kennicott
's
apprehension
the
dentist
*NL*
and
his
wife
had
not
been
taken
up
by
the
Westlakes
but
had
remained
*NL*
as
definitely
outside
really
smart
society
as
Willis
Woodford
,
who
was
*NL*
teller
,
bookkeeper
,
and
janitor
in
Stowbody
's
bank
.
Carol
had
noted
Mrs.
*NL*
Dillon
dragging
past
the
house
during
a
bridge
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
*NL*
looking
in
with
pathetic
lips
at
the
splendor
of
the
accepted
.
She
*NL*
impulsively
invited
the
Dillons
to
the
dramatic
association
meeting
,
and
*NL*
when
Kennicott
was
brusque
to
them
she
was
unusually
cordial
,
and
felt
*NL*
virtuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
self-approval
balanced
her
disappointment
at
the
smallness
of
the
*NL*
meeting
,
and
her
embarrassment
during
Raymie
Wutherspoon
's
repetitions
*NL*
of
``
The
stage
needs
uplifting
,
''
and
``
I
believe
that
there
are
great
*NL*
lessons
in
some
plays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ella
Stowbody
,
who
was
a
professional
,
having
studied
elocution
in
*NL*
Milwaukee
,
disapproved
of
Carol
's
enthusiasm
for
recent
plays
.
Miss
*NL*
Stowbody
expressed
the
fundamental
principle
of
the
American
drama
:
the
*NL*
only
way
to
be
artistic
is
to
present
Shakespeare
.
As
no
one
listened
to
*NL*
her
she
sat
back
and
looked
like
Lady
Macbeth
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Little
Theaters
,
which
were
to
give
piquancy
to
American
drama
three
*NL*
or
four
years
later
,
were
only
in
embryo
.
But
of
this
fast
coming
revolt
*NL*
Carol
had
premonitions
.
She
knew
from
some
lost
magazine
article
that
*NL*
in
Dublin
were
innovators
called
The
Irish
Players
.
She
knew
confusedly
*NL*
that
a
man
named
Gordon
Craig
had
painted
scenery
--
or
had
he
written
*NL*
plays
?
She
felt
that
in
the
turbulence
of
the
drama
she
was
discovering
*NL*
a
history
more
important
than
the
commonplace
chronicles
which
dealt
*NL*
with
senators
and
their
pompous
puerilities
.
She
had
a
sensation
of
*NL*
familiarity
;
a
dream
of
sitting
in
a
Brussels
cafe
and
going
afterward
*NL*
to
a
tiny
gay
theater
under
a
cathedral
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
advertisement
in
the
Minneapolis
paper
leaped
from
the
page
to
her
*NL*
eyes
:
*NL*
*NL*
The
Cosmos
School
of
Music
,
Oratory
,
and
*NL*
Dramatic
Art
announces
a
program
of
four
*NL*
one-act
plays
by
Schnitzler
,
Shaw
,
Yeats
,
*NL*
and
Lord
Dunsany
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
to
be
there
!
She
begged
Kennicott
to
``
run
down
to
the
Cities
''
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
do
n't
know
.
Be
fun
to
take
in
a
show
,
but
why
the
deuce
do
you
*NL*
want
to
see
those
darn
foreign
plays
,
given
by
a
lot
of
amateurs
?
Why
*NL*
do
n't
you
wait
for
a
regular
play
,
later
on
?
There
's
going
to
be
some
*NL*
corkers
coming
:
`
Lottie
of
Two-Gun
Rancho
,
'
and
`
Cops
and
Crooks
'
--
real
*NL*
Broadway
stuff
,
with
the
New
York
casts
.
What
's
this
junk
you
want
*NL*
to
see
?
Hm

`
How
He
Lied
to
Her
Husband
.

That
does
n't
listen
so
bad
.
*NL*
Sounds
racy
.
And
,
uh
,
well
,
I
could
go
to
the
motor
show
,
I
suppose
.
I
'd
*NL*
like
to
see
this
new
Hup
roadster
.
Well
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
knew
which
attraction
made
him
decide
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
four
days
of
delightful
worry
--
over
the
hole
in
her
one
good
*NL*
silk
petticoat
,
the
loss
of
a
string
of
beads
from
her
chiffon
and
brown
*NL*
velvet
frock
,
the
catsup
stain
on
her
best
georgette
crepe
blouse
.
She
*NL*
wailed
,
``
I
have
n't
a
single
solitary
thing
that
's
fit
to
be
seen
in
,
''
*NL*
and
enjoyed
herself
very
much
indeed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
went
about
casually
letting
people
know
that
he
was
``
going
to
*NL*
run
down
to
the
Cities
and
see
some
shows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
train
plodded
through
the
gray
prairie
,
on
a
windless
day
with
*NL*
the
smoke
from
the
engine
clinging
to
the
fields
in
giant
cotton-rolls
,
*NL*
in
a
low
and
writhing
wall
which
shut
off
the
snowy
fields
,
she
did
not
*NL*
look
out
of
the
window
.
She
closed
her
eyes
and
hummed
,
and
did
not
know
*NL*
that
she
was
humming
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
the
young
poet
attacking
fame
and
Paris
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
Minneapolis
station
the
crowd
of
lumberjacks
,
farmers
,
and
*NL*
Swedish
families
with
innumerous
children
and
grandparents
and
paper
*NL*
parcels
,
their
foggy
crowding
and
their
clamor
confused
her
.
She
felt
*NL*
rustic
in
this
once
familiar
city
,
after
a
year
and
a
half
of
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
was
certain
that
Kennicott
was
taking
the
wrong
*NL*
trolley-car
.
By
dusk
,
the
liquor
warehouses
,
Hebraic
clothing-shops
,
*NL*
and
lodging-houses
on
lower
Hennepin
Avenue
were
smoky
,
hideous
,
*NL*
ill-tempered
.
She
was
battered
by
the
noise
and
shuttling
of
the
*NL*
rush-hour
traffic
.
When
a
clerk
in
an
overcoat
too
closely
fitted
at
the
*NL*
waist
stared
at
her
,
she
moved
nearer
to
Kennicott
's
arm
.
The
clerk
was
*NL*
flippant
and
urban
.
He
was
a
superior
person
,
used
to
this
tumult
.
Was
*NL*
he
laughing
at
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
she
wanted
the
secure
quiet
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
hotel-lobby
she
was
self-conscious
.
She
was
not
used
to
hotels
;
*NL*
she
remembered
with
jealousy
how
often
Juanita
Haydock
talked
of
the
*NL*
famous
hotels
in
Chicago
.
She
could
not
face
the
traveling
salesmen
,
*NL*
baronial
in
large
leather
chairs
.
She
wanted
people
to
believe
that
her
*NL*
husband
and
she
were
accustomed
to
luxury
and
chill
elegance
;
she
was
*NL*
faintly
angry
at
him
for
the
vulgar
way
in
which
,
after
signing
the
*NL*
register
``
Dr.
W.
P.
Kennicott
&
wife
,
''
he
bellowed
at
the
clerk
,
``
Got
a
*NL*
nice
room
with
bath
for
us
,
old
man
?
''
She
gazed
about
haughtily
,
but
as
*NL*
she
discovered
that
no
one
was
interested
in
her
she
felt
foolish
,
and
*NL*
ashamed
of
her
irritation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
asserted
,
``
This
silly
lobby
is
too
florid
,
''
and
simultaneously
she
*NL*
admired
it
:
the
onyx
columns
with
gilt
capitals
,
the
crown-embroidered
*NL*
velvet
curtains
at
the
restaurant
door
,
the
silk-roped
alcove
where
*NL*
pretty
girls
perpetually
waited
for
mysterious
men
,
the
two-pound
boxes
*NL*
of
candy
and
the
variety
of
magazines
at
the
news-stand
.
The
hidden
*NL*
orchestra
was
lively
.
She
saw
a
man
who
looked
like
a
European
diplomat
,
*NL*
in
a
loose
top-coat
and
a
Homburg
hat
.
A
woman
with
a
broadtail
coat
,
*NL*
a
heavy
lace
veil
,
pearl
earrings
,
and
a
close
black
hat
entered
the
*NL*
restaurant
.
``
Heavens
!
That
's
the
first
really
smart
woman

've
seen
in
a
*NL*
year
!
''
Carol
exulted
.
She
felt
metropolitan
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
she
followed
Kennicott
to
the
elevator
the
coat-check
girl
,
a
*NL*
confident
young
woman
,
with
cheeks
powdered
like
lime
,
and
a
blouse
*NL*
low
and
thin
and
furiously
crimson
,
inspected
her
,
and
under
that
*NL*
supercilious
glance
Carol
was
shy
again
.
She
unconsciously
waited
*NL*
for
the
bellboy
to
precede
her
into
the
elevator
.
When
he
snorted
``
Go
*NL*
ahead
!
''
she
was
mortified
.
He
thought
she
was
a
hayseed
,
she
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
moment
she
was
in
their
room
,
with
the
bellboy
safely
out
of
the
*NL*
way
,
she
looked
critically
at
Kennicott
.
For
the
first
time
in
months
*NL*
she
really
saw
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
clothes
were
too
heavy
and
provincial
.
His
decent
gray
suit
,
made
*NL*
by
Nat
Hicks
of
Gopher
Prairie
,
might
have
been
of
sheet
iron
;
it
had
*NL*
no
distinction
of
cut
,
no
easy
grace
like
the
diplomat
's
Burberry
.
His
*NL*
black
shoes
were
blunt
and
not
well
polished
.
His
scarf
was
a
stupid
*NL*
brown
.
He
needed
a
shave
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
forgot
her
doubt
as
she
realized
the
ingenuities
of
the
room
.
*NL*
She
ran
about
,
turning
on
the
taps
of
the
bathtub
,
which
gushed
instead
*NL*
of
dribbling
like
the
taps
at
home
,
snatching
the
new
wash-rag
out
of
*NL*
its
envelope
of
oiled
paper
,
trying
the
rose-shaded
light
between
the
*NL*
twin
beds
,
pulling
out
the
drawers
of
the
kidney-shaped
walnut
desk
to
*NL*
examine
the
engraved
stationery
,
planning
to
write
on
it
to
every
one
*NL*
she
knew
,
admiring
the
claret-colored
velvet
armchair
and
the
blue
rug
,
*NL*
testing
the
ice-water
tap
,
and
squealing
happily
when
the
water
really
*NL*
did
come
out
cold
.
She
flung
her
arms
about
Kennicott
,
kissed
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
it
,
old
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
adorable
.
It
's
so
amusing
.
I
love
you
for
bringing
me
.
You
really
*NL*
are
a
dear
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
blankly
indulgent
,
and
yawned
,
and
condescended
,
``
That
's
a
*NL*
pretty
slick
arrangement
on
the
radiator
,
so
you
can
adjust
it
at
any
*NL*
temperature
you
want
.
Must
take
a
big
furnace
to
run
this
place
.
Gosh
,
I
*NL*
hope
Bea
remembers
to
turn
off
the
drafts
tonight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
glass
cover
of
the
dressing-table
was
a
menu
with
the
most
*NL*
enchanting
dishes
:
breast
of
guinea
hen
De
Vitresse
,
pommes
de
terre
a
*NL*
la
Russe
,
meringue
Chantilly
,
gateaux
Bruxelles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
's
--
I
'm
going
to
have
a
hot
bath
,
and
put
on
my
new
hat
with
*NL*
the
wool
flowers
,
and
let
's
go
down
and
eat
for
hours
,
and
we
'll
have
a
*NL*
cocktail
!
''
she
chanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Kennicott
labored
over
ordering
it
was
annoying
to
see
him
permit
*NL*
the
waiter
to
be
impertinent
,
but
as
the
cocktail
elevated
her
to
a
*NL*
bridge
among
colored
stars
,
as
the
oysters
came
in
--
not
canned
oysters
*NL*
in
the
Gopher
Prairie
fashion
,
but
on
the
half-shell
--
she
cried
,
``
If
you
*NL*
only
knew
how
wonderful
it
is
not
to
have
had
to
plan
this
dinner
,
and
*NL*
order
it
at
the
butcher
's
and
fuss
and
think
about
it
,
and
then
*NL*
watch
Bea
cook
it
!
I
feel
so
free
.
And
to
have
new
kinds
of
food
,
and
*NL*
different
patterns
of
dishes
and
linen
,
and
not
worry
about
whether
the
*NL*
pudding
is
being
spoiled
!
Oh
,
this
is
a
great
moment
for
me
!

*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
all
the
experiences
of
provincials
in
a
metropolis
.
After
*NL*
breakfast
Carol
bustled
to
a
hair-dresser
's
,
bought
gloves
and
a
blouse
,
*NL*
and
importantly
met
Kennicott
in
front
of
an
optician
's
,
in
accordance
*NL*
with
plans
laid
down
,
revised
,
and
verified
.
They
admired
the
diamonds
*NL*
and
furs
and
frosty
silverware
and
mahogany
chairs
and
polished
morocco
*NL*
sewing-boxes
in
shop-windows
,
and
were
abashed
by
the
throngs
in
the
*NL*
department-stores
,
and
were
bullied
by
a
clerk
into
buying
too
many
*NL*
shirts
for
Kennicott
,
and
gaped
at
the
``
clever
novelty
perfumes
--
just
*NL*
in
from
New
York
.
''
Carol
got
three
books
on
the
theater
,
and
spent
*NL*
an
exultant
hour
in
warning
herself
that
she
could
not
afford
this
*NL*
rajah-silk
frock
,
in
thinking
how
envious
it
would
make
Juanita
Haydock
,
*NL*
in
closing
her
eyes
,
and
buying
it
.
Kennicott
went
from
shop
to
shop
,
*NL*
earnestly
hunting
down
a
felt-covered
device
to
keep
the
windshield
of
*NL*
his
car
clear
of
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
dined
extravagantly
at
their
hotel
at
night
,
and
next
morning
*NL*
sneaked
round
the
corner
to
economize
at
a
Childs
'
Restaurant
.
They
were
*NL*
tired
by
three
in
the
afternoon
,
and
dozed
at
the
motion-pictures
and
*NL*
said
they
wished
they
were
back
in
Gopher
Prairie
--
and
by
eleven
in
the
*NL*
evening
they
were
again
so
lively
that
they
went
to
a
Chinese
restaurant
*NL*
that
was
frequented
by
clerks
and
their
sweethearts
on
pay-days
.
They
*NL*
sat
at
a
teak
and
marble
table
eating
Eggs
Fooyung
,
and
listened
to
a
*NL*
brassy
automatic
piano
,
and
were
altogether
cosmopolitan
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
street
they
met
people
from
home
--
the
McGanums
.
They
laughed
,
*NL*
shook
hands
repeatedly
,
and
exclaimed
,
``
Well
,
this
is
quite
a
*NL*
coincidence
!
''
They
asked
when
the
McGanums
had
come
down
,
and
begged
for
*NL*
news
of
the
town
they
had
left
two
days
before
.
Whatever
the
*NL*
McGanums
were
at
home
,
here
they
stood
out
as
so
superior
to
all
the
*NL*
undistinguishable
strangers
absurdly
hurrying
past
that
the
Kennicotts
*NL*
held
them
as
long
as
they
could
.
The
McGanums
said
good-by
as
though
*NL*
they
were
going
to
Tibet
instead
of
to
the
station
to
catch
No.
7
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
explored
Minneapolis
.
Kennicott
was
conversational
and
technical
*NL*
regarding
gluten
and
cockle-cylinders
and
No
.
I
Hard
,
when
they
were
*NL*
shown
through
the
gray
stone
hulks
and
new
cement
elevators
of
the
*NL*
largest
flour-mills
in
the
world
.
They
looked
across
Loring
Park
and
*NL*
the
Parade
to
the
towers
of
St.
Mark
's
and
the
Procathedral
,
and
the
*NL*
red
roofs
of
houses
climbing
Kenwood
Hill
.
They
drove
about
the
chain
of
*NL*
garden-circled
lakes
,
and
viewed
the
houses
of
the
millers
and
lumbermen
*NL*
and
real
estate
peers
--
the
potentates
of
the
expanding
city
.
They
*NL*
surveyed
the
small
eccentric
bungalows
with
pergolas
,
the
houses
of
*NL*
pebbledash
and
tapestry
brick
with
sleeping-porches
above
sun-parlors
,
*NL*
and
one
vast
incredible
chateau
fronting
the
Lake
of
the
Isles
.
They
*NL*
tramped
through
a
shining-new
section
of
apartment-houses
;
not
the
tall
*NL*
bleak
apartments
of
Eastern
cities
but
low
structures
of
cheerful
yellow
*NL*
brick
,
in
which
each
flat
had
its
glass-enclosed
porch
with
swinging
*NL*
couch
and
scarlet
cushions
and
Russian
brass
bowls
.
Between
a
waste
of
*NL*
tracks
and
a
raw
gouged
hill
they
found
poverty
in
staggering
shanties
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
miles
of
the
city
which
they
had
never
known
in
their
days
*NL*
of
absorption
in
college
.
They
were
distinguished
explorers
,
and
they
*NL*
remarked
,
in
great
mutual
esteem
,
``
I
bet
Harry
Haydock
's
never
seen
the
*NL*
City
like
this
!
Why
,
he
'd
never
have
sense
enough
to
study
the
machinery
*NL*
in
the
mills
,
or
go
through
all
these
outlying
districts
.
Wonder
folks
*NL*
in
Gopher
Prairie
would
n't
use
their
legs
and
explore
,
the
way
we
do
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
two
meals
with
Carol
's
sister
,
and
were
bored
,
and
felt
that
*NL*
intimacy
which
beatifies
married
people
when
they
suddenly
admit
that
*NL*
they
equally
dislike
a
relative
of
either
of
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
it
was
with
affection
but
also
with
weariness
that
they
approached
*NL*
the
evening
on
which
Carol
was
to
see
the
plays
at
the
dramatic
school
.
*NL*
Kennicott
suggested
not
going
.
``
So
darn
tired
from
all
this
walking
;
*NL*
do
n't
know
but
what
we
better
turn
in
early
and
get
rested
up
.
''
It
was
*NL*
only
from
duty
that
Carol
dragged
him
and
herself
out
of
the
warm
*NL*
hotel
,
into
a
stinking
trolley
,
up
the
brownstone
steps
of
the
converted
*NL*
residence
which
lugubriously
housed
the
dramatic
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
a
long
whitewashed
hall
with
a
clumsy
draw-curtain
across
*NL*
the
front
.
The
folding
chairs
were
filled
with
people
who
looked
washed
*NL*
and
ironed
:
parents
of
the
pupils
,
girl
students
,
dutiful
teachers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strikes
me
it
's
going
to
be
punk
.
If
the
first
play
is
n't
good
,
let
's
*NL*
beat
it
,
''
said
Kennicott
hopefully
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
right
,
''
she
yawned
.
With
hazy
eyes
she
tried
to
read
the
lists
of
*NL*
characters
,
which
were
hidden
among
lifeless
advertisements
of
pianos
,
*NL*
music-dealers
,
restaurants
,
candy
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
regarded
the
Schnitzler
play
with
no
vast
interest
.
The
actors
*NL*
moved
and
spoke
stiffly
.
Just
as
its
cynicism
was
beginning
to
rouse
her
*NL*
village-dulled
frivolity
,
it
was
over
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
think
a
whale
of
a
lot
of
that
.
How
about
taking
a
sneak
?
''
*NL*
petitioned
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
let
's
try
the
next
one
,
`
How
He
Lied
to
Her
Husband
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Shaw
conceit
amused
her
,
and
perplexed
Kennicott
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Strikes
me
it
's
darn
fresh
.
Thought
it
would
be
racy
.
Do
n't
know
as
I
*NL*
think
much
of
a
play
where
a
husband
actually
claims
he
wants
a
fellow
*NL*
to
make
love
to
his
wife
.
No
husband
ever
did
that
!
Shall
we
shake
a
*NL*
leg
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
see
this
Yeats
thing
,
`
Land
of
Heart
's
Desire
.
'
I
used
to
*NL*
love
it
in
college
.
''
She
was
awake
now
,
and
urgent
.
``
I
know
you
did
n't
*NL*
care
so
much
for
Yeats
when
I
read
him
aloud
to
you
,
but
you
just
see
if
*NL*
you
do
n't
adore
him
on
the
stage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
cast
were
as
unwieldy
as
oak
chairs
marching
,
and
the
*NL*
setting
was
an
arty
arrangement
of
batik
scarfs
and
heavy
tables
,
but
*NL*
Maire
Bruin
was
slim
as
Carol
,
and
larger-eyed
,
and
her
voice
was
*NL*
a
morning
bell
.
In
her
,
Carol
lived
,
and
on
her
lifting
voice
was
*NL*
transported
from
this
sleepy
small-town
husband
and
all
the
rows
of
*NL*
polite
parents
to
the
stilly
loft
of
a
thatched
cottage
where
in
a
green
*NL*
dimness
,
beside
a
window
caressed
by
linden
branches
,
she
bent
over
a
*NL*
chronicle
of
twilight
women
and
the
ancient
gods
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
gosh
--
nice
kid
played
that
girl
--
good-looker
,
''
said
Kennicott
.
*NL*
``
Want
to
stay
for
the
last
piece
?
Heh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
shivered
.
She
did
not
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
curtain
was
again
drawn
aside
.
On
the
stage
they
saw
nothing
but
*NL*
long
green
curtains
and
a
leather
chair
.
Two
young
men
in
brown
robes
*NL*
like
furniture-covers
were
gesturing
vacuously
and
droning
cryptic
*NL*
sentences
full
of
repetitions
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Carol
's
first
hearing
of
Dunsany
.
She
sympathized
with
the
*NL*
restless
Kennicott
as
he
felt
in
his
pocket
for
a
cigar
and
unhappily
*NL*
put
it
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Without
understanding
when
or
how
,
without
a
tangible
change
in
the
*NL*
stilted
intoning
of
the
stage-puppets
,
she
was
conscious
of
another
time
*NL*
and
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
Stately
and
aloof
among
vainglorious
tiring-maids
,
a
queen
in
robes
*NL*
that
murmured
on
the
marble
floor
,
she
trod
the
gallery
of
a
crumbling
*NL*
palace
.
In
the
courtyard
,
elephants
trumpeted
,
and
swart
men
with
beards
*NL*
dyed
crimson
stood
with
blood-stained
hands
folded
upon
their
hilts
,
*NL*
guarding
the
caravan
from
El
Sharnak
,
the
camels
with
Tyrian
stuffs
*NL*
of
topaz
and
cinnabar
.
Beyond
the
turrets
of
the
outer
wall
the
jungle
*NL*
glared
and
shrieked
,
and
the
sun
was
furious
above
drenched
orchids
.
*NL*
A
youth
came
striding
through
the
steel-bossed
doors
,
the
sword-bitten
*NL*
doors
that
were
higher
than
ten
tall
men
.
He
was
in
flexible
mail
,
and
*NL*
under
the
rim
of
his
planished
morion
were
amorous
curls
.
His
hand
was
*NL*
out
to
her
;
before
she
touched
it
she
could
feel
its
warmth
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Gosh
all
hemlock
!
What
the
dickens
is
all
this
stuff
about
,
Carrie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
Syrian
queen
.
She
was
Mrs.
Dr.
Kennicott
.
She
fell
with
a
*NL*
jolt
into
a
whitewashed
hall
and
sat
looking
at
two
scared
girls
and
a
*NL*
young
man
in
wrinkled
tights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
fondly
rambled
as
they
left
the
hall
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
deuce
did
that
last
spiel
mean
?
Could
n't
make
head
or
tail
of
*NL*
it
.
If
that
's
highbrow
drama
,
give
me
a
cow-puncher
movie
,
every
time
!
*NL*
Thank
God
,
that
's
over
,
and
we
can
get
to
bed
.
Wonder
if
we
would
n't
*NL*
make
time
by
walking
over
to
Nicollet
to
take
a
car
?
One
thing
I
will
*NL*
say
for
that
dump
:
they
had
it
warm
enough
.
Must
have
a
big
hot-air
*NL*
furnace
,
I
guess
.
Wonder
how
much
coal
it
takes
to
run
'em
through
the
*NL*
winter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
car
he
affectionately
patted
her
knee
,
and
he
was
for
a
second
*NL*
the
striding
youth
in
armor
;
then
he
was
Doc
Kennicott
of
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
,
and
she
was
recaptured
by
Main
Street
.
Never
,
not
all
her
life
,
*NL*
would
she
behold
jungles
and
the
tombs
of
kings
.
There
were
strange
*NL*
things
in
the
world
,
they
really
existed
;
but
she
would
never
see
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
recreate
them
in
plays
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
make
the
dramatic
association
understand
her
aspiration
.
They
*NL*
would
,
surely
they
would
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
doubtfully
at
the
impenetrable
reality
of
yawning
trolley
*NL*
conductor
and
sleepy
passengers
and
placards
advertising
soap
and
*NL*
underwear
.

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
hurried
to
the
first
meeting
of
the
play-reading
committee
.
Her
*NL*
jungle
romance
had
faded
,
but
she
retained
a
religious
fervor
,
a
surge
*NL*
of
half-formed
thought
about
the
creation
of
beauty
by
suggestion
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
Dunsany
play
would
be
too
difficult
for
the
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
association
.
She
would
let
them
compromise
on
Shaw
--
on
``
Androcles
and
*NL*
the
Lion
,
''
which
had
just
been
published
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
committee
was
composed
of
Carol
,
Vida
Sherwin
,
Guy
Pollock
,
Raymie
*NL*
Wutherspoon
,
and
Juanita
Haydock
.
They
were
exalted
by
the
picture
of
*NL*
themselves
as
being
simultaneously
business-like
and
artistic
.
They
*NL*
were
entertained
by
Vida
in
the
parlor
of
Mrs.
Elisha
Gurrey
's
*NL*
boarding-house
,
with
its
steel
engraving
of
Grant
at
Appomattox
,
its
*NL*
basket
of
stereoscopic
views
,
and
its
mysterious
stains
on
the
gritty
*NL*
carpet
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
was
an
advocate
of
culture-buying
and
efficiency-systems
.
She
*NL*
hinted
that
they
ought
to
have
-LRB-
as
at
the
committee-meetings
of
the
*NL*
Thanatopsis
-RRB-
a
``
regular
order
of
business
,
''
and
``
the
reading
of
the
*NL*
minutes
,
''
but
as
there
were
no
minutes
to
read
,
and
as
no
one
knew
*NL*
exactly
what
was
the
regular
order
of
the
business
of
being
literary
,
*NL*
they
had
to
give
up
efficiency
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
,
as
chairman
,
said
politely
,
``
Have
you
any
ideas
about
what
play
*NL*
we
'd
better
give
first
?
''
She
waited
for
them
to
look
abashed
and
vacant
,
*NL*
so
that
she
might
suggest
``
Androcles
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
Pollock
answered
with
disconcerting
readiness
,
``
I
'll
tell
you
:
since
*NL*
we
're
going
to
try
to
do
something
artistic
,
and
not
simply
fool
around
,
*NL*
I
believe
we
ought
to
give
something
classic
.
How
about
`
The
School
for
*NL*
Scandal
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
Do
n't
you
think
that
has
been
done
a
good
deal
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
perhaps
it
has
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
ready
to
say
,
``
How
about
Bernard
Shaw
?
''
when
he
treacherously
*NL*
went
on
,
``
How
would
it
be
then
to
give
a
Greek
drama
--
say
`
Oedipus
*NL*
Tyrannus
'
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
I
do
n't
believe
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
Sherwin
intruded
,
``
I
'm
sure
that
would
be
too
hard
for
us
.
Now
I
've
*NL*
brought
something
that
I
think
would
be
awfully
jolly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
held
out
,
and
Carol
incredulously
took
,
a
thin
gray
pamphlet
*NL*
entitled
``
McGinerty
's
Mother-in-law
.
''
It
was
the
sort
of
farce
which
is
*NL*
advertised
in
``
school
entertainment
''
catalogues
as
:
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Riproaring
knock-out
,
5
m.
3
f.
,
time
2
hrs.
,
interior
set
,
popular
with
*NL*
churches
and
all
high-class
occasions
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
glanced
from
the
scabrous
object
to
Vida
,
and
realized
that
she
*NL*
was
not
joking
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
this
is
--
this
is
--
why
,
it
's
just
a
--
Why
,
Vida
,
I
thought
you
*NL*
appreciated
--
well
--
appreciated
art
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
snorted
,
``
Oh
.
Art
.
Oh
yes
.
I
do
like
art
.
It
's
very
nice
.
But
after
*NL*
all
,
what
does
it
matter
what
kind
of
play
we
give
as
long
as
we
get
the
*NL*
association
started
?
The
thing
that
matters
is
something
that
none
of
*NL*
you
have
spoken
of
,
that
is
:
what
are
we
going
to
do
with
the
money
,
if
*NL*
we
make
any
?
I
think
it
would
be
awfully
nice
if
we
presented
the
high
*NL*
school
with
a
full
set
of
Stoddard
's
travel-lectures
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
moaned
,
``
Oh
,
but
Vida
dear
,
do
forgive
me
but
this
farce
--
Now
*NL*
what
I
'd
like
us
to
give
is
something
distinguished
.
Say
Shaw
's
*NL*
`
Androcles
.
'
Have
any
of
you
read
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
Good
play
,
''
said
Guy
Pollock
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Raymie
Wutherspoon
astoundingly
spoke
up
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
have
I.
I
read
through
all
the
plays
in
the
public
library
,
so
's
*NL*
to
be
ready
for
this
meeting
.
And
--
But
I
do
n't
believe
you
grasp
*NL*
the
irreligious
ideas
in
this
`
Androcles
,
'
Mrs.
Kennicott
.
I
guess
the
*NL*
feminine
mind
is
too
innocent
to
understand
all
these
immoral
writers
.
*NL*
I
'm
sure
I
do
n't
want
to
criticize
Bernard
Shaw
;
I
understand
he
is
very
*NL*
popular
with
the
highbrows
in
Minneapolis
;
but
just
the
same
--
As
far
*NL*
as
I
can
make
out
,
he
's
downright
improper
!
The
things
he
SAYS
--
Well
,
*NL*
it
would
be
a
very
risky
thing
for
our
young
folks
to
see
.
It
seems
to
*NL*
me
that
a
play
that
does
n't
leave
a
nice
taste
in
the
mouth
and
that
*NL*
has
n't
any
message
is
nothing
but
--
nothing
but
--
Well
,
whatever
it
may
*NL*
be
,
it
is
n't
art
.
So
--
Now
I
've
found
a
play
that
is
clean
,
and
there
's
*NL*
some
awfully
funny
scenes
in
it
,
too
.
I
laughed
out
loud
,
reading
it
.
*NL*
It
's
called
`
His
Mother
's
Heart
,
'
and
it
's
about
a
young
man
in
college
*NL*
who
gets
in
with
a
lot
of
free-thinkers
and
boozers
and
everything
,
but
*NL*
in
the
end
his
mother
's
influence
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
broke
in
with
a
derisive
,
``
Oh
rats
,
Raymie
!
Can
the
*NL*
mother
's
influence
!
I
say
let
's
give
something
with
some
class
to
it
.
*NL*
I
bet
we
could
get
the
rights
to
`
The
Girl
from
Kankakee
,
'
and
that
's
a
*NL*
real
show
.
It
ran
for
eleven
months
in
New
York
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
would
be
lots
of
fun
,
if
it
would
n't
cost
too
much
,
''
reflected
*NL*
Vida
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
was
the
only
vote
cast
against
``
The
Girl
from
Kankakee
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
disliked
``
The
Girl
from
Kankakee
''
even
more
than
she
had
expected
.
*NL*
It
narrated
the
success
of
a
farm-lassie
in
clearing
her
brother
of
a
*NL*
charge
of
forgery
.
She
became
secretary
to
a
New
York
millionaire
and
*NL*
social
counselor
to
his
wife
;
and
after
a
well-conceived
speech
on
the
*NL*
discomfort
of
having
money
,
she
married
his
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
also
a
humorous
office-boy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
discerned
that
both
Juanita
Haydock
and
Ella
Stowbody
wanted
the
*NL*
lead
.
She
let
Juanita
have
it
.
Juanita
kissed
her
and
in
the
exuberant
*NL*
manner
of
a
new
star
presented
to
the
executive
committee
her
theory
,
*NL*
``
What
we
want
in
a
play
is
humor
and
pep
.
There
's
where
American
*NL*
playwrights
put
it
all
over
these
darn
old
European
glooms
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
selected
by
Carol
and
confirmed
by
the
committee
,
the
persons
of
the
*NL*
play
were
:
*NL*
*NL*
John
Grimm
,
a
millionaire
.
.
.
.
Guy
Pollock
*NL*
His

Miss

Dr.

Raymond

Miss

Mrs.
Harold
C.

*NL*
Her

Dr.

*NL*
Among
the
minor
lamentations
was
Maud
Dyer
's
``
Well
of
course
I
suppose
I
*NL*
look
old
enough
to
be
Juanita
's
mother
,
even
if
Juanita
is
eight
months
*NL*
older
than
I
am
,
but
I
do
n't
know
as
I
care
to
have
everybody
noticing
*NL*
it
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
pleaded
,
``
Oh
,
my
DEAR
!
You
two
look
exactly
the
same
age
.
I
chose
*NL*
you
because
you
have
such
a
darling
complexion
,
and
you
know
with
powder
*NL*
and
a
white
wig
,
anybody
looks
twice
her
age
,
and
I
want
the
mother
to
*NL*
be
sweet
,
no
matter
who
else
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Ella
Stowbody
,
the
professional
,
perceiving
that
it
was
because
of
a
*NL*
conspiracy
of
jealousy
that
she
had
been
given
a
small
part
,
alternated
*NL*
between
lofty
amusement
and
Christian
patience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
hinted
that
the
play
would
be
improved
by
cutting
,
but
as
every
*NL*
actor
except
Vida
and
Guy
and
herself
wailed
at
the
loss
of
a
single
*NL*
line
,
she
was
defeated
.
She
told
herself
that
,
after
all
,
a
great
deal
*NL*
could
be
done
with
direction
and
settings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
Clark
had
boastfully
written
about
the
dramatic
association
to
his
*NL*
schoolmate
,
Percy
Bresnahan
,
president
of
the
Velvet
Motor
Company
*NL*
of
Boston
.
Bresnahan
sent
a
check
for
a
hundred
dollars
;
Sam
added
*NL*
twenty-five
and
brought
the
fund
to
Carol
,
fondly
crying
,
``
There
!
*NL*
That
'll
give
you
a
start
for
putting
the
thing
across
swell
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rented
the
second
floor
of
the
city
hall
for
two
months
.
All
through
*NL*
the
spring
the
association
thrilled
to
its
own
talent
in
that
dismal
*NL*
room
.
They
cleared
out
the
bunting
,
ballot-boxes
,
handbills
,
legless
*NL*
chairs
.
They
attacked
the
stage
.
It
was
a
simple-minded
stage
.
It
was
*NL*
raised
above
the
floor
,
and
it
did
have
a
movable
curtain
,
painted
with
*NL*
the
advertisement
of
a
druggist
dead
these
ten
years
,
but
otherwise
*NL*
it
might
not
have
been
recognized
as
a
stage
.
There
were
two
*NL*
dressing-rooms
,
one
for
men
,
one
for
women
,
on
either
side
.
The
*NL*
dressing-room
doors
were
also
the
stage-entrances
,
opening
from
the
*NL*
house
,
and
many
a
citizen
of
Gopher
Prairie
had
for
his
first
glimpse
of
*NL*
romance
the
bare
shoulders
of
the
leading
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
three
sets
of
scenery
:
a
woodland
,
a
Poor
Interior
,
and
a
*NL*
Rich
Interior
,
the
last
also
useful
for
railway
stations
,
offices
,
and
*NL*
as
a
background
for
the
Swedish
Quartette
from
Chicago
.
There
were
three
*NL*
gradations
of
lighting
:
full
on
,
half
on
,
and
entirely
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
the
only
theater
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
It
was
known
as
the
``
op
`
ra
*NL*
house
.
''
Once
,
strolling
companies
had
used
it
for
performances
of
``
The
*NL*
Two
Orphans
,
''
and
``
Nellie
the
Beautiful
Cloak
Model
,
''
and
``
Othello
''
with
*NL*
specialties
between
acts
,
but
now
the
motion-pictures
had
ousted
the
*NL*
gipsy
drama
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
intended
to
be
furiously
modern
in
constructing
the
office-set
,
*NL*
the
drawing-room
for
Mr.
Grimm
,
and
the
Humble
Home
near
Kankakee
.
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
that
any
one
in
Gopher
Prairie
had
been
so
*NL*
revolutionary
as
to
use
enclosed
scenes
with
continuous
side-walls
.
The
*NL*
rooms
in
the
op
`
ra
house
sets
had
separate
wing-pieces
for
sides
,
which
*NL*
simplified
dramaturgy
,
as
the
villain
could
always
get
out
of
the
hero
's
*NL*
way
by
walking
out
through
the
wall
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inhabitants
of
the
Humble
Home
were
supposed
to
be
amiable
and
*NL*
intelligent
.
Carol
planned
for
them
a
simple
set
with
warm
color
.
She
*NL*
could
see
the
beginning
of
the
play
:
all
dark
save
the
high
settles
and
*NL*
the
solid
wooden
table
between
them
,
which
were
to
be
illuminated
by
a
*NL*
ray
from
offstage
.
The
high
light
was
a
polished
copper
pot
filled
with
*NL*
primroses
.
Less
clearly
she
sketched
the
Grimm
drawing-room
as
a
series
*NL*
of
cool
high
white
arches
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
how
she
was
to
produce
these
effects
she
had
no
notion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
discovered
that
,
despite
the
enthusiastic
young
writers
,
the
*NL*
drama
was
not
half
so
native
and
close
to
the
soil
as
motor
cars
and
*NL*
telephones
.
She
discovered
that
simple
arts
require
sophisticated
*NL*
training
.
She
discovered
that
to
produce
one
perfect
stage-picture
would
*NL*
be
as
difficult
as
to
turn
all
of
Gopher
Prairie
into
a
Georgian
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
read
all
she
could
find
regarding
staging
,
she
bought
paint
and
*NL*
light
wood
;
she
borrowed
furniture
and
drapes
unscrupulously
;
she
made
*NL*
Kennicott
turn
carpenter
.
She
collided
with
the
problem
of
lighting
.
*NL*
Against
the
protest
of
Kennicott
and
Vida
she
mortgaged
the
association
*NL*
by
sending
to
Minneapolis
for
a
baby
spotlight
,
a
strip
light
,
a
dimming
*NL*
device
,
and
blue
and
amber
bulbs
;
and
with
the
gloating
rapture
of
*NL*
a
born
painter
first
turned
loose
among
colors
,
she
spent
absorbed
*NL*
evenings
in
grouping
,
dimming-painting
with
lights
.
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Kennicott
,
Guy
,
and
Vida
helped
her
.
They
speculated
as
to
how
*NL*
flats
could
be
lashed
together
to
form
a
wall
;
they
hung
crocus-yellow
*NL*
curtains
at
the
windows
;
they
blacked
the
sheet-iron
stove
;
they
put
on
*NL*
aprons
and
swept
.
The
rest
of
the
association
dropped
into
the
theater
*NL*
every
evening
,
and
were
literary
and
superior
.
They
had
borrowed
*NL*
Carol
's
manuals
of
play-production
and
had
become
extremely
stagey
in
*NL*
vocabulary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
,
Rita
Simons
,
and
Raymie
Wutherspoon
sat
on
a
sawhorse
,
*NL*
watching
Carol
try
to
get
the
right
position
for
a
picture
on
the
wall
*NL*
in
the
first
scene
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
hand
myself
anything
but
I
believe
I
'll
give
a
swell
*NL*
performance
in
this
first
act
,
''
confided
Juanita
.
``
I
wish
Carol
was
n't
*NL*
so
bossy
though
.
She
does
n't
understand
clothes
.
I
want
to
wear
,
oh
,
*NL*
a
dandy
dress
I
have
--
all
scarlet
--
and
I
said
to
her
,
`
When
I
enter
*NL*
would
n't
it
knock
their
eyes
out
if
I
just
stood
there
at
the
door
in
*NL*
this
straight
scarlet
thing
?
'
But
she
would
n't
let
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Young
Rita
agreed
,
``
She
's
so
much
taken
up
with
her
old
details
and
*NL*
carpentering
and
everything
that
she
ca
n't
see
the
picture
as
a
whole
.
*NL*
Now
I
thought
it
would
be
lovely
if
we
had
an
office-scene
like
the
one
*NL*
in
`
Little
,
But
Oh
My
!
'
Because
I
SAW
that
,
in
Duluth
.
But
she
simply
*NL*
would
n't
listen
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
sighed
,
``
I
wanted
to
give
one
speech
like
Ethel
Barrymore
would
,
*NL*
if
she
was
in
a
play
like
this
.
-LRB-
Harry
and
I
heard
her
one
time
in
*NL*
Minneapolis
--
we
had
dandy
seats
,
in
the
orchestra
--
I
just
know
I
could
*NL*
imitate
her
.
-RRB-
Carol
did
n't
pay
any
attention
to
my
suggestion
.
I
do
n't
*NL*
want
to
criticize
but
I
guess
Ethel
knows
more
about
acting
than
Carol
*NL*
does
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
do
you
think
Carol
has
the
right
dope
about
using
a
strip
light
*NL*
behind
the
fireplace
in
the
second
act
?
I
told
her
I
thought
we
ought
to
*NL*
use
a
bunch
,
''
offered
Raymie
.
``
And
I
suggested
it
would
be
lovely
if
we
*NL*
used
a
cyclorama
outside
the
window
in
the
first
act
,
and
what
do
you
*NL*
think
she
said
?
`
Yes
,
and
it
would
be
lovely
to
have
Eleanora
Duse
play
*NL*
the
lead
,
'
she
said
,
`
and
aside
from
the
fact
that
it
's
evening
in
the
*NL*
first
act
,
you
're
a
great
technician
,
'
she
said
.
I
must
say
I
think
she
*NL*
was
pretty
sarcastic
.
I
've
been
reading
up
,
and
I
know
I
could
build
a
*NL*
cyclorama
,
if
she
did
n't
want
to
run
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
another
thing
,
I
think
the
entrance
in
the
first
act
ought
to
*NL*
be
L.
U.
E.
,
not
L.
3
E.
,
''
from
Juanita
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
why
does
she
just
use
plain
white
tormenters
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
tormenter
?
''
blurted
Rita
Simons
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
savants
stared
at
her
ignorance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
not
resent
their
criticisms
,
she
did
n't
very
much
resent
*NL*
their
sudden
knowledge
,
so
long
as
they
let
her
make
pictures
.
It
was
at
*NL*
rehearsals
that
the
quarrrels
broke
.
No
one
understood
that
rehearsals
*NL*
were
as
real
engagements
as
bridge-games
or
sociables
at
the
Episcopal
*NL*
Church
.
They
gaily
came
in
half
an
hour
late
,
or
they
vociferously
came
*NL*
in
ten
minutes
early
,
and
they
were
so
hurt
that
they
whispered
about
*NL*
resigning
when
Carol
protested
.
They
telephoned
,
``
I
do
n't
think
I
'd
*NL*
better
come
out
;
afraid
the
dampness
might
start
my
toothache
,
''
or
*NL*
``
Guess
ca
n't
make
it
tonight
;
Dave
wants
me
to
sit
in
on
a
poker
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
,
after
a
month
of
labor
,
as
many
as
nine-elevenths
of
the
cast
were
*NL*
often
present
at
a
rehearsal
;
when
most
of
them
had
learned
their
parts
*NL*
and
some
of
them
spoke
like
human
beings
,
Carol
had
a
new
shock
in
the
*NL*
realization
that
Guy
Pollock
and
herself
were
very
bad
actors
,
and
that
*NL*
Raymie
Wutherspoon
was
a
surprisingly
good
one
.
For
all
her
visions
*NL*
she
could
not
control
her
voice
,
and
she
was
bored
by
the
fiftieth
*NL*
repetition
of
her
few
lines
as
maid
.
Guy
pulled
his
soft
mustache
,
*NL*
looked
self-conscious
,
and
turned
Mr.
Grimm
into
a
limp
dummy
.
But
*NL*
Raymie
,
as
the
villain
,
had
no
repressions
.
The
tilt
of
his
head
was
*NL*
full
of
character
;
his
drawl
was
admirably
vicious
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
evening
when
Carol
hoped
she
was
going
to
make
a
play
;
a
*NL*
rehearsal
during
which
Guy
stopped
looking
abashed
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
that
evening
the
play
declined
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
weary
.
``
We
know
our
parts
well
enough
now
;
what
's
the
use
of
*NL*
getting
sick
of
them
?
''
they
complained
.
They
began
to
skylark
;
to
play
*NL*
with
the
sacred
lights
;
to
giggle
when
Carol
was
trying
to
make
the
*NL*
sentimental
Myrtle
Cass
into
a
humorous
office-boy
;
to
act
everything
*NL*
but
``
The
Girl
from
Kankakee
.
''
After
loafing
through
his
proper
part
*NL*
Dr.
Terry
Gould
had
great
applause
for
his
burlesque
of
``
Hamlet
.
''
Even
*NL*
Raymie
lost
his
simple
faith
,
and
tried
to
show
that
he
could
do
a
*NL*
vaudeville
shuffle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
turned
on
the
company
.
``
See
here
,
I
want
this
nonsense
to
stop
.
*NL*
We
've
simply
got
to
get
down
to
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
led
the
mutiny
:
``
Look
here
,
Carol
,
do
n't
be
so
bossy
.
*NL*
After
all
,
we
're
doing
this
play
principally
for
the
fun
of
it
,
and
if
*NL*
we
have
fun
out
of
a
lot
of
monkey-shines
,
why
then
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ye-es
,
''
feebly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
said
one
time
that
folks
in
G.
P.
did
n't
get
enough
fun
out
of
*NL*
life
.
And
now
we
are
having
a
circus
,
you
want
us
to
stop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
answered
slowly
:
``
I
wonder
if
I
can
explain
what
I
mean
?
It
's
the
*NL*
difference
between
looking
at
the
comic
page
and
looking
at
Manet
.
I
*NL*
want
fun
out
of
this
,
of
course
.
Only
--
I
do
n't
think
it
would
be
*NL*
less
fun
,
but
more
,
to
produce
as
perfect
a
play
as
we
can
.
''
She
was
*NL*
curiously
exalted
;
her
voice
was
strained
;
she
stared
not
at
the
company
*NL*
but
at
the
grotesques
scrawled
on
the
backs
of
wing-pieces
by
forgotten
*NL*
stage-hands
.
``
I
wonder
if
you
can
understand
the
`
fun
'
of
making
a
*NL*
beautiful
thing
,
the
pride
and
satisfaction
of
it
,
and
the
holiness
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
company
glanced
doubtfully
at
one
another
.
In
Gopher
Prairie
it
*NL*
is
not
good
form
to
be
holy
except
at
a
church
,
between
ten-thirty
and
*NL*
twelve
on
Sunday
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
if
we
want
to
do
it
,
we
've
got
to
work
;
we
must
have
*NL*
self-discipline
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
at
once
amused
and
embarrassed
.
They
did
not
want
to
affront
*NL*
this
mad
woman
.
They
backed
off
and
tried
to
rehearse
.
Carol
did
not
*NL*
hear
Juanita
,
in
front
,
protesting
to
Maud
Dyer
,
``
If
she
calls
it
fun
*NL*
and
holiness
to
sweat
over
her
darned
old
play
--
well
,
I
do
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
attended
the
only
professional
play
which
came
to
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
that
spring
.
It
was
a
``
tent
show
,
presenting
snappy
new
dramas
under
*NL*
canvas
.
''
The
hard-working
actors
doubled
in
brass
,
and
took
tickets
;
*NL*
and
between
acts
sang
about
the
moon
in
June
,
and
sold
Dr.
Wintergreen
's
*NL*
Surefire
Tonic
for
Ills
of
the
Heart
,
Lungs
,
Kidneys
,
and
Bowels
.
They
*NL*
presented
``
Sunbonnet
Nell
:
A
Dramatic
Comedy
of
the
Ozarks
,
''
with
J.
*NL*
Witherbee
Boothby
wringing
the
soul
by
his
resonant
``
Yuh
ai
n't
done
*NL*
right
by
mah
little
gal
,
Mr.
City
Man
,
but
yer
a-goin

to
find
that
back
*NL*
in
these-yere
hills
there
's
honest
folks
and
good
shots
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
audience
,
on
planks
beneath
the
patched
tent
,
admired
Mr.
Boothby
's
*NL*
beard
and
long
rifle
;
stamped
their
feet
in
the
dust
at
the
spectacle
*NL*
of
his
heroism
;
shouted
when
the
comedian
aped
the
City
Lady
's
use
of
a
*NL*
lorgnon
by
looking
through
a
doughnut
stuck
on
a
fork
;
wept
visibly
over
*NL*
Mr.
Boothby
's
Little
Gal
Nell
,
who
was
also
Mr.
Boothby
's
legal
wife
*NL*
Pearl
,
and
when
the
curtain
went
down
,
listened
respectfully
to
Mr.
*NL*
Boothby
's
lecture
on
Dr.
Wintergreen
's
Tonic
as
a
cure
for
tape-worms
,
*NL*
which
he
illustrated
by
horrible
pallid
objects
curled
in
bottles
of
*NL*
yellowing
alcohol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
shook
her
head
.
``
Juanita
is
right
.
I
'm
a
fool
.
Holiness
of
the
*NL*
drama
!
Bernard
Shaw
!
The
only
trouble
with
`
The
Girl
from
Kankakee
'
is
*NL*
that
it
's
too
subtle
for
Gopher
Prairie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sought
faith
in
spacious
banal
phrases
,
taken
from
books
:
``
the
*NL*
instinctive
nobility
of
simple
souls
,
''
``
need
only
the
opportunity
,
to
*NL*
appreciate
fine
things
,
''
and
``
sturdy
exponents
of
democracy
.
''
But
these
*NL*
optimisms
did
not
sound
so
loud
as
the
laughter
of
the
audience
at
the
*NL*
funny-man
's
line
,
``
Yes
,
by
heckelum
,
I
'm
a
smart
fella
.
''
She
wanted
to
*NL*
give
up
the
play
,
the
dramatic
association
,
the
town
.
As
she
came
out
*NL*
of
the
tent
and
walked
with
Kennicott
down
the
dusty
spring
street
,
she
*NL*
peered
at
this
straggling
wooden
village
and
felt
that
she
could
not
*NL*
possibly
stay
here
through
all
of
tomorrow
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Miles
Bjornstam
who
gave
her
strength
--
he
and
the
fact
that
every
*NL*
seat
for
``
The
Girl
from
Kankakee
''
had
been
sold
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bjornstam
was
``
keeping
company
''
with
Bea
.
Every
night
he
was
sitting
on
*NL*
the
back
steps
.
Once
when
Carol
appeared
he
grumbled
,
``
Hope
you
're
going
*NL*
to
give
this
burg
one
good
show

If
you
do
n't
,

ever
will

''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
great
night
;
it
was
the
night
of
the
play
.
The
two
*NL*
dressing-rooms
were
swirling
with
actors
,
panting
,
twitchy
pale
.
Del
*NL*
Snafflin
the
barber
,
who
was
as
much
a
professional
as
Ella
,
having
once
*NL*
gone
on
in
a
mob
scene
at
a
stock-company
performance
in
Minneapolis
,
*NL*
was
making
them
up
,
and
showing
his
scorn
for
amateurs
with
,
``
Stand
*NL*
still
!
For
the
love
o
'
Mike
,
how
do
you
expect
me
to
get
your
eyelids
*NL*
dark
if
you
keep
a-wigglin
'
?
''
The
actors
were
beseeching
,
``
Hey
,
Del
,
put
*NL*
some
red
in
my
nostrils
--
you
put
some
in
Rita
's

gee
,
you
did
n't
hardly
*NL*
do
anything
to
my
face
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
enormously
theatric
.
They
examined
Del
's
makeup
box
,
they
*NL*
sniffed
the
scent
of
grease-paint
,
every
minute
they
ran
out
to
peep
*NL*
through
the
hole
in
the
curtain
,
they
came
back
to
inspect
their
wigs
*NL*
and
costumes
,
they
read
on
the
whitewashed
walls
of
the
dressing-rooms
*NL*
the
pencil
inscriptions
:
``
The
Flora
Flanders
Comedy
Company
,
''
and
``
This
*NL*
is
a
bum
theater
,
''
and
felt
that
they
were
companions
of
these
vanished
*NL*
troupers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
,
smart
in
maid
's
uniform
,
coaxed
the
temporary
stage-hands
to
*NL*
finish
setting
the
first
act
,
wailed
at
Kennicott
,
the
electrician
,
``
Now
*NL*
for
heaven
's
sake
remember
the
change
in
cue
for
the
ambers
in
Act
Two
,
''
*NL*
slipped
out
to
ask
Dave
Dyer
,
the
ticket-taker
,
if
he
could
get
some
*NL*
more
chairs
,
warned
the
frightened
Myrtle
Cass
to
be
sure
to
upset
the
*NL*
waste-basket
when
John
Grimm
called
,
``
Here
you
,
Reddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Del
Snafflin
's
orchestra
of
piano
,
violin
,
and
cornet
began
to
tune
up
*NL*
and
every
one
behind
the
magic
line
of
the
proscenic
arch
was
frightened
*NL*
into
paralysis
.
Carol
wavered
to
the
hole
in
the
curtain
.
There
were
so
*NL*
many
people
out
there
,
staring
so
hard
--
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
second
row
she
saw
Miles
Bjornstam
,
not
with
Bea
but
alone
.
*NL*
He
really
wanted
to
see
the
play
!
It
was
a
good
omen
.
Who
could
tell
?
*NL*
Perhaps
this
evening
would
convert
Gopher
Prairie
to
conscious
beauty
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
darted
into
the
women
's
dressing-room
,
roused
Maud
Dyer
from
her
*NL*
fainting
panic
,
pushed
her
to
the
wings
,
and
ordered
the
curtain
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
rose
doubtfully
,
it
staggered
and
trembled
,
but
it
did
get
up
without
*NL*
catching
--
this
time
.
Then
she
realized
that
Kennicott
had
forgotten
to
*NL*
turn
off
the
houselights
.
Some
one
out
front
was
giggling
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
galloped
round
to
the
left
wing
,
herself
pulled
the
switch
,
looked
*NL*
so
ferociously
at
Kennicott
that
he
quaked
,
and
fled
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dyer
was
creeping
out
on
the
half-darkened
stage
.
The
play
was
*NL*
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
with
that
instant
Carol
realized
that
it
was
a
bad
play
abominably
*NL*
acted
.
*NL*
*NL*
Encouraging
them
with
lying
smiles
,
she
watched
her
work
go
to
pieces
.
*NL*
The
settings
seemed
flimsy
,
the
lighting
commonplace
.
She
watched
*NL*
Guy
Pollock
stammer
and
twist
his
mustache
when
he
should
have
been
a
*NL*
bullying
magnate
;
Vida
Sherwin
,
as
Grimm
's
timid
wife
,
chatter
at
the
*NL*
audience
as
though
they
were
her
class
in
high-school
English
;
Juanita
,
*NL*
in
the
leading
role
,
defy
Mr.
Grimm
as
though
she
were
repeating
a
list
*NL*
of
things
she
had
to
buy
at
the
grocery
this
morning
;
Ella
Stowbody
*NL*
remark
``
I
'd
like
a
cup
of
tea
''
as
though
she
were
reciting
``
Curfew
Shall
*NL*
Not
Ring
Tonight
''
;
and
Dr.
Gould
,
making
love
to
Rita
Simons
,
squeak
,
*NL*
``
My
--
my
--
you
--
are
--
a
--
won
`
erful
--
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Myrtle
Cass
,
as
the
office-boy
,
was
so
much
pleased
by
the
applause
of
*NL*
her
relatives
,
then
so
much
agitated
by
the
remarks
of
Cy
Bogart
,
in
the
*NL*
back
row
,
in
reference
to
her
wearing
trousers
,
that
she
could
hardly
*NL*
be
got
off
the
stage
.
Only
Raymie
was
so
unsociable
as
to
devote
himself
*NL*
entirely
to
acting
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
she
was
right
in
her
opinion
of
the
play
Carol
was
certain
when
*NL*
Miles
Bjornstam
went
out
after
the
first
act
,
and
did
not
come
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Between
the
second
and
third
acts
she
called
the
company
together
,
*NL*
and
supplicated
,
``
I
want
to
know
something
,
before
we
have
a
chance
to
*NL*
separate
.
Whether
we
're
doing
well
or
badly
tonight
,
it
is
a
beginning
.
*NL*
But
will
we
take
it
as
merely
a
beginning
?
How
many
of
you
will
pledge
*NL*
yourselves
to
start
in
with
me
,
right
away
,
tomorrow
,
and
plan
for
*NL*
another
play
,
to
be
given
in
September
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stared
at
her
;
they
nodded
at
Juanita
's
protest
:
``
I
think
*NL*
one
's
enough
for
a
while
.
It
's
going
elegant
tonight
,
but
another
*NL*
play
--
Seems
to
me
it
'll
be
time
enough
to
talk
about
that
next
fall
.
*NL*
Carol
!
I
hope
you
do
n't
mean
to
hint
and
suggest
we
're
not
doing
fine
*NL*
tonight
?
I
'm
sure
the
applause
shows
the
audience
think
it
's
just
*NL*
dandy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Carol
knew
how
completely
she
had
failed
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
audience
seeped
out
she
heard
B.
J.
Gougerling
the
banker
say
to
*NL*
Howland
the
grocer
,
``
Well
,
I
think
the
folks
did
splendid
;
just
as
good
*NL*
as
professionals
.
But
I
do
n't
care
much
for
these
plays
.
What
I
like
is
*NL*
a
good
movie
,
with
auto
accidents
and
hold-ups
,
and
some
git
to
it
,
and
*NL*
not
all
this
talky-talk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
Carol
knew
how
certain
she
was
to
fail
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wearily
did
not
blame
them
,
company
nor
audience
.
Herself
she
blamed
*NL*
for
trying
to
carve
intaglios
in
good
wholesome
jack-pine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
worst
defeat
of
all
.
I
'm
beaten
.
By
Main
Street
.
'
I
must
go
*NL*
on
.
'
But
I
ca
n't
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
not
vastly
encouraged
by
the
Gopher
Prairie
Dauntless
:
*NL*
*NL*
...
would
be
impossible
to
distinguish
among
the
actors
when
all
gave
*NL*
such
fine
account
of
themselves
in
difficult
roles
of
this
well-known
*NL*
New
York
stage
play
.
Guy
Pollock
as
the
old
millionaire
could
not
have
*NL*
been
bettered
for
his
fine
impersonation
of
the
gruff
old
millionaire
;
*NL*
Mrs.
Harry
Haydock
as
the
young
lady
from
the
West
who
so
easily
showed
*NL*
the
New
York
four-flushers
where
they
got
off
was
a
vision
of
loveliness
*NL*
and
with
fine
stage
presence
.
Miss
Vida
Sherwin
the
ever
popular
teacher
*NL*
in
our
high
school
pleased
as
Mrs.
Grimm
,
Dr.
Gould
was
well
suited
in
*NL*
the
role
of
young
lover
--
girls
you
better
look
out
,
remember
the
doc
is
a
*NL*
bachelor
.
The
local
Four
Hundred
also
report
that
he
is
a
great
hand
at
*NL*
shaking
the
light
fantastic
tootsies
in
the
dance
.
As
the
stenographer
*NL*
Rita
Simons
was
pretty
as
a
picture
,
and
Miss
Ella
Stowbody
's
long
and
*NL*
intensive
study
of
the
drama
and
kindred
arts
in
Eastern
schools
was
*NL*
seen
in
the
fine
finish
of
her
part
.
*NL*
*NL*
...
to
no
one
is
greater
credit
to
be
given
than
to
Mrs.
Will
Kennicott
*NL*
on
whose
capable
shoulders
fell
the
burden
of
directing
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
kindly
,
''
Carol
mused
,
``
so
well
meant
,
so
neighborly
--
and
so
*NL*
confoundedly
untrue
.
Is
it
really
my
failure
,
or
theirs
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sought
to
be
sensible
;
she
elaborately
explained
to
herself
that
it
*NL*
was
hysterical
to
condemn
Gopher
Prairie
because
it
did
not
foam
over
*NL*
the
drama
.
Its
justification
was
in
its
service
as
a
market-town
for
*NL*
farmers
.
How
bravely
and
generously
it
did
its
work
,
forwarding
the
*NL*
bread
of
the
world
,
feeding
and
healing
the
farmers
!
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
on
the
corner
below
her
husband
's
office
,
she
heard
a
farmer
*NL*
holding
forth
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
Course
I
was
beaten
.
The
shipper
and
the
grocers
here
would
n't
*NL*
pay
us
a
decent
price
for
our
potatoes
,
even
though
folks
in
the
cities
*NL*
were
howling
for
'em
.
So
we
says
,
well
,
we
'll
get
a
truck
and
ship
'em
*NL*
right
down
to
Minneapolis
.
But
the
commission
merchants
there
were
in
*NL*
cahoots
with
the
local
shipper
here
;
they
said
they
would
n't
pay
us
*NL*
a
cent
more
than
he
would
,
not
even
if
they
was
nearer
to
the
market
.
*NL*
Well
,
we
found
we
could
get
higher
prices
in
Chicago
,
but
when
we
tried
*NL*
to
get
freight
cars
to
ship
there
,
the
railroads
would
n't
let
us
have
*NL*
'em
--
even
though
they
had
cars
standing
empty
right
here
in
the
yards
.
*NL*
There
you
got
it
--
good
market
,
and
these
towns
keeping
us
from
it
.
Gus
,
*NL*
that
's
the
way
these
towns
work
all
the
time
.
They
pay
what
they
want
*NL*
to
for
our
wheat
,
but
we
pay
what
they
want
us
to
for
their
clothes
.
*NL*
Stowbody
and
Dawson
foreclose
every
mortgage
they
can
,
and
put
in
tenant
*NL*
farmers
.
The
Dauntless
lies
to
us
about
the
Nonpartisan
League
,
the
*NL*
lawyers
sting
us
,
the
machinery-dealers
hate
to
carry
us
over
bad
years
,
*NL*
and
then
their
daughters
put
on
swell
dresses
and
look
at
us
as
if
we
*NL*
were
a
bunch
of
hoboes
.
Man
,
I
'd
like
to
burn
this
town
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
observed
,
``
There
's
that
old
crank
Wes
Brannigan
shooting
off
*NL*
his
mouth
again
.
Gosh
,
but
he
loves
to
hear
himself
talk
!
They
ought
to
*NL*
run
that
fellow
out
of
town
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
old
and
detached
through
high-school
commencement
week
,
which
*NL*
is
the
fete
of
youth
in
Gopher
Prairie
;
through
baccalaureate
sermon
,
*NL*
senior
Parade
,
junior
entertainment
,
commencement
address
by
an
Iowa
*NL*
clergyman
who
asserted
that
he
believed
in
the
virtue
of
virtuousness
,
*NL*
and
the
procession
of
Decoration
Day
,
when
the
few
Civil
War
veterans
*NL*
followed
Champ
Perry
,
in
his
rusty
forage-cap
,
along
the
spring-powdered
*NL*
road
to
the
cemetery
.
She
met
Guy
;
she
found
that
she
had
nothing
to
*NL*
say
to
him
.
Her
head
ached
in
an
aimless
way
.
When
Kennicott
rejoiced
,
*NL*
``
We
'll
have
a
great
time
this
summer
;
move
down
to
the
lake
early
and
*NL*
wear
old
clothes
and
act
natural
,
''
she
smiled
,
but
her
smile
creaked
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
prairie
heat
she
trudged
along
unchanging
ways
,
talked
about
*NL*
nothing
to
tepid
people
,
and
reflected
that
she
might
never
escape
from
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
startled
to
find
that
she
was
using
the
word
``
escape
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
for
three
years
which
passed
like
one
curt
paragraph
,
she
ceased
*NL*
to
find
anything
interesting
save
the
Bjornstams
and
her
baby
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
IN
three
years
of
exile
from
herself
Carol
had
certain
experiences
*NL*
chronicled
as
important
by
the
Dauntless
,
or
discussed
by
the
Jolly
*NL*
Seventeen
,
but
the
event
unchronicled
,
undiscussed
,
and
supremely
*NL*
controlling
,
was
her
slow
admission
of
longing
to
find
her
own
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
and
Miles
Bjornstam
were
married
in
June
,
a
month
after
``
The
Girl
*NL*
from
Kankakee
.
''
Miles
had
turned
respectable
.
He
had
renounced
his
*NL*
criticisms
of
state
and
society
;
he
had
given
up
roving
as
horse-trader
,
*NL*
and
wearing
red
mackinaws
in
lumber-camps
;
he
had
gone
to
work
as
*NL*
engineer
in
Jackson
Elder
's
planing-mill
;
he
was
to
be
seen
upon
the
*NL*
streets
endeavoring
to
be
neighborly
with
suspicious
men
whom
he
had
*NL*
taunted
for
years
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
the
patroness
and
manager
of
the
wedding
.
Juanita
Haydock
*NL*
mocked
,
``
You
're
a
chump
to
let
a
good
hired
girl
like
Bea
go
.
Besides
!
*NL*
How
do
you
know
it
's
a
good
thing
,
her
marrying
a
sassy
bum
like
this
*NL*
awful
Red
Swede
person
?
Get
wise
!
Chase
the
man
off
with
a
mop
,
and
*NL*
hold
onto
your
Svenska
while
the
holding
's
good
.
Huh
?
Me
go
to
their
*NL*
Scandahoofian
wedding
?
Not
a
chance
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
matrons
echoed
Juanita
.
Carol
was
dismayed
by
the
casualness
*NL*
of
their
cruelty
,
but
she
persisted
.
Miles
had
exclaimed
to
her
,
``
Jack
*NL*
Elder
says
maybe
he
'll
come
to
the
wedding
!
Gee
,
it
would
be
nice
to
*NL*
have
Bea
meet
the
Boss
as
a
reg
`
lar
married
lady
.
Some
day
I
'll
be
so
*NL*
well
off
that
Bea
can
play
with
Mrs.
Elder
--
and
you
!
Watch
us
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
an
uneasy
knot
of
only
nine
guests
at
the
service
in
the
*NL*
unpainted
Lutheran
Church
--
Carol
,
Kennicott
,
Guy
Pollock
,
and
the
Champ
*NL*
Perrys
,
all
brought
by
Carol
;
Bea
's
frightened
rustic
parents
,
her
*NL*
cousin
Tina
,
and
Pete
,
Miles
's
ex-partner
in
horse-trading
,
a
surly
,
*NL*
hairy
man
who
had
bought
a
black
suit
and
come
twelve
hundred
miles
from
*NL*
Spokane
for
the
event
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
continuously
glanced
back
at
the
church
door
.
Jackson
Elder
did
*NL*
not
appear
.
The
door
did
not
once
open
after
the
awkward
entrance
of
the
*NL*
first
guests
.
Miles
's
hand
closed
on
Bea
's
arm
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
,
with
Carol
's
help
,
made
his
shanty
over
into
a
cottage
with
*NL*
white
curtains
and
a
canary
and
a
chintz
chair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
coaxed
the
powerful
matrons
to
call
on
Bea
.
They
half
scoffed
,
*NL*
half
promised
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
's
successor
was
the
oldish
,
broad
,
silent
Oscarina
,
who
was
*NL*
suspicious
of
her
frivolous
mistress
for
a
month
,
so
that
Juanita
*NL*
Haydock
was
able
to
crow
,
``
There
,
smarty
,
I
told
you
you
'd
run
into
the
*NL*
Domestic
Problem
!
''
But
Oscarina
adopted
Carol
as
a
daughter
,
and
with
*NL*
her
as
faithful
to
the
kitchen
as
Bea
had
been
,
there
was
nothing
*NL*
changed
in
Carol
's
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
unexpectedly
appointed
to
the
town
library-board
by
Ole
Jenson
,
*NL*
the
new
mayor
.
The
other
members
were
Dr.
Westlake
,
Lyman
Cass
,
Julius
*NL*
Flickerbaugh
the
attorney
,
Guy
Pollock
,
and
Martin
Mahoney
,
former
*NL*
livery-stable
keeper
and
now
owner
of
a
garage
.
She
was
delighted
.
She
*NL*
went
to
the
first
meeting
rather
condescendingly
,
regarding
herself
*NL*
as
the
only
one
besides
Guy
who
knew
anything
about
books
or
library
*NL*
methods
.
She
was
planning
to
revolutionize
the
whole
system
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
condescension
was
ruined
and
her
humility
wholesomely
increased
when
*NL*
she
found
the
board
,
in
the
shabby
room
on
the
second
floor
of
the
house
*NL*
which
had
been
converted
into
the
library
,
not
discussing
the
weather
*NL*
and
longing
to
play
checkers
,
but
talking
about
books
.
She
discovered
*NL*
that
amiable
old
Dr.
Westlake
read
everything
in
verse
and
``
light
*NL*
fiction
''
;
that
Lyman
Cass
,
the
veal-faced
,
bristly-bearded
owner
of
the
*NL*
mill
,
had
tramped
through
Gibbon
,
Hume
,
Grote
,
Prescott
,
and
the
other
*NL*
thick
historians
;
that
he
could
repeat
pages
from
them
--
and
did
.
When
*NL*
Dr.
Westlake
whispered
to
her
,
``
Yes
,
Lym
is
a
very
well-informed
man
,
*NL*
but
he
's
modest
about
it
,
''
she
felt
uninformed
and
immodest
,
and
scolded
*NL*
at
herself
that
she
had
missed
the
human
potentialities
in
this
vast
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
When
Dr.
Westlake
quoted
the
``
Paradiso
,
''
``
Don
Quixote
,
''
*NL*
``
Wilhelm
Meister
,
''
and
the
Koran
,
she
reflected
that
no
one
she
knew
,
*NL*
not
even
her
father
,
had
read
all
four
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
diffidently
to
the
second
meeting
of
the
board
.
She
did
not
*NL*
plan
to
revolutionize
anything
.
She
hoped
that
the
wise
elders
might
be
*NL*
so
tolerant
as
to
listen
to
her
suggestions
about
changing
the
shelving
*NL*
of
the
juveniles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
after
four
sessions
of
the
library-board
she
was
where
she
had
been
*NL*
before
the
first
session
.
She
had
found
that
for
all
their
pride
in
*NL*
being
reading
men
,
Westlake
and
Cass
and
even
Guy
had
no
conception
of
*NL*
making
the
library
familiar
to
the
whole
town
.
They
used
it
,
they
passed
*NL*
resolutions
about
it
,
and
they
left
it
as
dead
as
Moses
.
Only
the
Henty
*NL*
books
and
the
Elsie
books
and
the
latest
optimisms
by
moral
female
*NL*
novelists
and
virile
clergymen
were
in
general
demand
,
and
the
board
*NL*
themselves
were
interested
only
in
old
,
stilted
volumes
.
They
had
no
*NL*
tenderness
for
the
noisiness
of
youth
discovering
great
literature
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
was
egotistic
about
her
tiny
learning
,
they
were
at
least
as
much
*NL*
so
regarding
theirs
.
And
for
all
their
talk
of
the
need
of
additional
*NL*
library-tax
none
of
them
was
willing
to
risk
censure
by
battling
for
it
,
*NL*
though
they
now
had
so
small
a
fund
that
,
after
paying
for
rent
,
heat
,
*NL*
light
,
and
Miss
Villets
's
salary
,
they
had
only
a
hundred
dollars
a
year
*NL*
for
the
purchase
of
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Incident
of
the
Seventeen
Cents
killed
her
none
too
enduring
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
come
to
the
board-meeting
singing
with
a
plan
.
She
had
made
*NL*
a
list
of
thirty
European
novels
of
the
past
ten
years
,
with
twenty
*NL*
important
books
on
psychology
,
education
,
and
economics
which
the
*NL*
library
lacked
.
She
had
made
Kennicott
promise
to
give
fifteen
dollars
.
*NL*
If
each
of
the
board
would
contribute
the
same
,
they
could
have
the
*NL*
books
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lym
Cass
looked
alarmed
,
scratched
himself
,
and
protested
,
``
I
think
*NL*
it
would
be
a
bad
precedent
for
the
board-members
to
contribute
*NL*
money
--
uh
--
not
that
I
mind
,
but
it
would
n't
be
fair
--
establish
*NL*
precedent
.
Gracious
!
They
do
n't
pay
us
a
cent
for
our
services
!
*NL*
Certainly
ca
n't
expect
us
to
pay
for
the
privilege
of
serving
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
Guy
looked
sympathetic
,
and
he
stroked
the
pine
table
and
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rest
of
the
meeting
they
gave
to
a
bellicose
investigation
of
the
*NL*
fact
that
there
was
seventeen
cents
less
than
there
should
be
in
the
*NL*
Fund
.
Miss
Villets
was
summoned
;
she
spent
half
an
hour
in
explosively
*NL*
defending
herself
;
the
seventeen
cents
were
gnawed
over
,
penny
by
penny
;
*NL*
and
Carol
,
glancing
at
the
carefully
inscribed
list
which
had
been
*NL*
so
lovely
and
exciting
an
hour
before
,
was
silent
,
and
sorry
for
Miss
*NL*
Villets
,
and
sorrier
for
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
reasonably
regular
in
attendance
till
her
two
years
were
up
and
*NL*
Vida
Sherwin
was
appointed
to
the
board
in
her
place
,
but
she
did
not
*NL*
try
to
be
revolutionary
.
In
the
plodding
course
of
her
life
there
was
*NL*
nothing
changed
,
and
nothing
new
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
made
an
excellent
land-deal
,
but
as
he
told
her
none
of
the
*NL*
details
,
she
was
not
greatly
exalted
or
agitated
.
What
did
agitate
her
*NL*
was
his
announcement
,
half
whispered
and
half
blurted
,
half
tender
and
*NL*
half
coldly
medical
,
that
they
``
ought
to
have
a
baby
,
now
they
could
*NL*
afford
it
.
''
They
had
so
long
agreed
that
``
perhaps
it
would
be
just
as
*NL*
well
not
to
have
any
children
for
a
while
yet
,
''
that
childlessness
had
*NL*
come
to
be
natural
.
Now
,
she
feared
and
longed
and
did
not
know
;
she
*NL*
hesitatingly
assented
,
and
wished
that
she
had
not
assented
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
there
appeared
no
change
in
their
drowsy
relations
,
she
forgot
all
*NL*
about
it
,
and
life
was
planless
.

*NL*
Idling
on
the
porch
of
their
summer
cottage
at
the
lake
,
on
afternoons
*NL*
when
Kennicott
was
in
town
,
when
the
water
was
glazed
and
the
whole
air
*NL*
languid
,
she
pictured
a
hundred
escapes
:
Fifth
Avenue
in
a
snow-storm
,
*NL*
with
limousines
,
golden
shops
,
a
cathedral
spire
.
A
reed
hut
on
*NL*
fantastic
piles
above
the
mud
of
a
jungle
river
.
A
suite
in
Paris
,
*NL*
immense
high
grave
rooms
,
with
lambrequins
and
a
balcony
.
The
Enchanted
*NL*
Mesa
.
An
ancient
stone
mill
in
Maryland
,
at
the
turn
of
the
road
,
*NL*
between
rocky
brook
and
abrupt
hills
.
An
upland
moor
of
sheep
and
*NL*
flitting
cool
sunlight
.
A
clanging
dock
where
steel
cranes
unloaded
*NL*
steamers
from
Buenos
Ayres
and
Tsing-tao
.
A
Munich
concert-hall
,
and
a
*NL*
famous
`
cellist
playing
--
playing
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
scene
had
a
persistent
witchery
:
*NL*
*NL*
She
stood
on
a
terrace
overlooking
a
boulevard
by
the
warm
sea
.
She
was
*NL*
certain
,
though
she
had
no
reason
for
it
,
that
the
place
was
Mentone
.
*NL*
Along
the
drive
below
her
swept
barouches
,
with
a
mechanical
tlot-tlot
,
*NL*
tlot-tlot
,
tlot-tlot
,
and
great
cars
with
polished
black
hoods
and
*NL*
engines
quiet
as
the
sigh
of
an
old
man
.
In
them
were
women
erect
,
*NL*
slender
,
enameled
,
and
expressionless
as
marionettes
,
their
small
hands
*NL*
upon
parasols
,
their
unchanging
eyes
always
forward
,
ignoring
the
men
*NL*
beside
them
,
tall
men
with
gray
hair
and
distinguished
faces
.
Beyond
the
*NL*
drive
were
painted
sea
and
painted
sands
,
and
blue
and
yellow
pavilions
.
*NL*
Nothing
moved
except
the
gliding
carriages
,
and
the
people
were
small
*NL*
and
wooden
,
spots
in
a
picture
drenched
with
gold
and
hard
bright
blues
.
*NL*
There
was
no
sound
of
sea
or
winds
;
no
softness
of
whispers
nor
of
*NL*
falling
petals
;
nothing
but
yellow
and
cobalt
and
staring
light
,
and
the
*NL*
never-changing
tlot-tlot
,
tlot-tlot
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
startled
.
She
whimpered
.
It
was
the
rapid
ticking
of
the
clock
which
*NL*
had
hypnotized
her
into
hearing
the
steady
hoofs
.
No
aching
color
of
the
*NL*
sea
and
pride
of
supercilious
people
,
but
the
reality
of
a
round-bellied
*NL*
nickel
alarm-clock
on
a
shelf
against
a
fuzzy
unplaned
pine
wall
,
with
*NL*
a
stiff
gray
wash-rag
hanging
above
it
and
a
kerosene-stove
standing
*NL*
below
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
thousand
dreams
governed
by
the
fiction
she
had
read
,
drawn
from
the
*NL*
pictures
she
had
envied
,
absorbed
her
drowsy
lake
afternoons
,
but
*NL*
always
in
the
midst
of
them
Kennicott
came
out
from
town
,
drew
on
khaki
*NL*
trousers
which
were
plastered
with
dry
fish-scales
,
asked
,
``
Enjoying
*NL*
yourself
?
''
and
did
not
listen
to
her
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
nothing
was
changed
,
and
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
that
there
*NL*
ever
would
be
change
.

VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Trains
!
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
lake
cottage
she
missed
the
passing
of
the
trains
.
She
realized
*NL*
that
in
town
she
had
depended
upon
them
for
assurance
that
there
*NL*
remained
a
world
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
railroad
was
more
than
a
means
of
transportation
to
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
It
was
a
new
god
;
a
monster
of
steel
limbs
,
oak
ribs
,
flesh
of
gravel
,
*NL*
and
a
stupendous
hunger
for
freight
;
a
deity
created
by
man
that
he
*NL*
might
keep
himself
respectful
to
Property
,
as
elsewhere
he
had
elevated
*NL*
and
served
as
tribal
gods
the
mines
,
cotton-mills
,
motor-factories
,
*NL*
colleges
,
army
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
East
remembered
generations
when
there
had
been
no
railroad
,
and
had
*NL*
no
awe
of
it
;
but
here
the
railroads
had
been
before
time
was
.
The
towns
*NL*
had
been
staked
out
on
barren
prairie
as
convenient
points
for
future
*NL*
train-halts
;
and
back
in
1860
and
1870
there
had
been
much
profit
,
much
*NL*
opportunity
to
found
aristocratic
families
,
in
the
possession
of
advance
*NL*
knowledge
as
to
where
the
towns
would
arise
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
a
town
was
in
disfavor
,
the
railroad
could
ignore
it
,
cut
it
off
from
*NL*
commerce
,
slay
it
.
To
Gopher
Prairie
the
tracks
were
eternal
verities
,
*NL*
and
boards
of
railroad
directors
an
omnipotence
.
The
smallest
boy
or
the
*NL*
most
secluded
grandam
could
tell
you
whether
No.
32
had
a
hot-box
last
*NL*
Tuesday
,
whether
No.
7
was
going
to
put
on
an
extra
day-coach
;
and
the
*NL*
name
of
the
president
of
the
road
was
familiar
to
every
breakfast
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
this
new
era
of
motors
the
citizens
went
down
to
the
station
*NL*
to
see
the
trains
go
through
.
It
was
their
romance
;
their
only
mystery
*NL*
besides
mass
at
the
Catholic
Church
;
and
from
the
trains
came
lords
of
*NL*
the
outer
world
--
traveling
salesmen
with
piping
on
their
waistcoats
,
and
*NL*
visiting
cousins
from
Milwaukee
.
*NL*
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
had
once
been
a
``
division-point
.
''
The
roundhouse
and
*NL*
repair-shops
were
gone
,
but
two
conductors
still
retained
residence
,
*NL*
and
they
were
persons
of
distinction
,
men
who
traveled
and
talked
to
*NL*
strangers
,
who
wore
uniforms
with
brass
buttons
,
and
knew
all
about
*NL*
these
crooked
games
of
con-men
.
They
were
a
special
caste
,
neither
above
*NL*
nor
below
the
Haydocks
,
but
apart
,
artists
and
adventurers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
night
telegraph-operator
at
the
railroad
station
was
the
most
*NL*
melodramatic
figure
in
town
:
awake
at
three
in
the
morning
,
alone
in
a
*NL*
room
hectic
with
clatter
of
the
telegraph
key
.
All
night
he
``
talked
''
*NL*
to
operators
twenty
,
fifty
,
a
hundred
miles
away
.
It
was
always
to
be
*NL*
expected
that
he
would
be
held
up
by
robbers
.
He
never
was
,
but
round
*NL*
him
was
a
suggestion
of
masked
faces
at
the
window
,
revolvers
,
cords
*NL*
binding
him
to
a
chair
,
his
struggle
to
crawl
to
the
key
before
he
*NL*
fainted
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
blizzards
everything
about
the
railroad
was
melodramatic
.
There
*NL*
were
days
when
the
town
was
completely
shut
off
,
when
they
had
no
mail
,
*NL*
no
express
,
no
fresh
meat
,
no
newspapers
.
At
last
the
rotary
snow-plow
*NL*
came
through
,
bucking
the
drifts
,
sending
up
a
geyser
,
and
the
way
to
*NL*
the
Outside
was
open
again
.
The
brakemen
,
in
mufflers
and
fur
caps
,
*NL*
running
along
the
tops
of
ice-coated
freight-cars
;
the
engineers
*NL*
scratching
frost
from
the
cab
windows
and
looking
out
,
inscrutable
,
*NL*
self-contained
,
pilots
of
the
prairie
sea
--
they
were
heroism
,
they
were
*NL*
to
Carol
the
daring
of
the
quest
in
a
world
of
groceries
and
sermons
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
small
boys
the
railroad
was
a
familiar
playground
.
They
climbed
*NL*
the
iron
ladders
on
the
sides
of
the
box-cars
;
built
fires
behind
piles
*NL*
of
old
ties
;
waved
to
favorite
brakemen
.
But
to
Carol
it
was
magic
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
motoring
with
Kennicott
,
the
car
lumping
through
darkness
,
the
*NL*
lights
showing
mud-puddles
and
ragged
weeds
by
the
road
.
A
train
coming
!
*NL*
A
rapid
chuck-a-chuck
,
chuck-a-chuck
,
chuck-a-chuck
.
It
was
hurling
*NL*
past
--
the
Pacific
Flyer
,
an
arrow
of
golden
flame
.
Light
from
the
*NL*
fire-box
splashed
the
under
side
of
the
trailing
smoke
.
Instantly
the
*NL*
vision
was
gone
;
Carol
was
back
in
the
long
darkness
;
and
Kennicott
was
*NL*
giving
his
version
of
that
fire
and
wonder
:
``
No.
19
.
Must
be
`
bout
ten
*NL*
minutes
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
town
,
she
listened
from
bed
to
the
express
whistling
in
the
cut
a
*NL*
mile
north
.
Uuuuuuu
!
--
faint
,
nervous
,
distrait
,
horn
of
the
free
night
*NL*
riders
journeying
to
the
tall
towns
where
were
laughter
and
*NL*
banners
and
the
sound
of
bells
--
Uuuuu
!
Uuuuu
!
--
the
world
going
*NL*
by
--
Uuuuuuu
!
--
fainter
,
more
wistful
,
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Down
here
there
were
no
trains
.
The
stillness
was
very
great
.
The
*NL*
prairie
encircled
the
lake
,
lay
round
her
,
raw
,
dusty
,
thick
.
Only
the
*NL*
train
could
cut
it
.
Some
day
she
would
take
a
train
;
and
that
would
be
a
*NL*
great
taking
.

She
turned
to
the
Chautauqua
as
she
had
turned
to
the
dramatic
*NL*
association
,
to
the
library-board
.
*NL*
*NL*
Besides
the
permanent
Mother
Chautauqua
,
in
New
York
,
there
are
,
all
*NL*
over
these
States
,
commercial
Chautauqua
companies
which
send
out
to
*NL*
every
smallest
town
troupes
of
lecturers
and
``
entertainers
''
to
give
a
*NL*
week
of
culture
under
canvas
.
Living
in
Minneapolis
,
Carol
had
never
*NL*
encountered
the
ambulant
Chautauqua
,
and
the
announcement
of
its
coming
*NL*
to
Gopher
Prairie
gave
her
hope
that
others
might
be
doing
the
vague
*NL*
things
which
she
had
attempted
.
She
pictured
a
condensed
university
*NL*
course
brought
to
the
people
.
Mornings
when
she
came
in
from
the
lake
*NL*
with
Kennicott
she
saw
placards
in
every
shop-window
,
and
strung
on
*NL*
a
cord
across
Main
Street
,
a
line
of
pennants
alternately
worded
*NL*
``
The
Boland
Chautauqua
COMING
!
''
and
``
A
solid
week
of
inspiration
and
*NL*
enjoyment
!
''
But
she
was
disappointed
when
she
saw
the
program
.
It
did
*NL*
not
seem
to
be
a
tabloid
university
;
it
did
not
seem
to
be
any
kind
of
*NL*
a
university
;
it
seemed
to
be
a
combination
of
vaudeville
performance
Y.
*NL*
M.
C.
A.
lecture
,
and
the
graduation
exercises
of
an
elocution
class
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
her
doubt
to
Kennicott
.
He
insisted
,
``
Well
,
maybe
it
wo
n't
be
*NL*
so
awful
darn
intellectual
,
the
way
you
and
I
might
like
it
,
but
it
's
*NL*
a
whole
lot
better
than
nothing
.
''
Vida
Sherwin
added
,
``
They
have
*NL*
some
splendid
speakers
.
If
the
people
do
n't
carry
off
so
much
actual
*NL*
information
,
they
do
get
a
lot
of
new
ideas
,
and
that
's
what
counts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
Chautauqua
Carol
attended
three
evening
meetings
,
two
*NL*
afternoon
meetings
,
and
one
in
the
morning
.
She
was
impressed
by
the
*NL*
audience
:
the
sallow
women
in
skirts
and
blouses
,
eager
to
be
made
to
*NL*
think
,
the
men
in
vests
and
shirt-sleeves
,
eager
to
be
allowed
to
laugh
,
*NL*
and
the
wriggling
children
,
eager
to
sneak
away
.
She
liked
the
plain
*NL*
benches
,
the
portable
stage
under
its
red
marquee
,
the
great
tent
over
*NL*
all
,
shadowy
above
strings
of
incandescent
bulbs
at
night
and
by
day
*NL*
casting
an
amber
radiance
on
the
patient
crowd
.
The
scent
of
dust
*NL*
and
trampled
grass
and
sun-baked
wood
gave
her
an
illusion
of
Syrian
*NL*
caravans
;
she
forgot
the
speakers
while
she
listened
to
noises
outside
*NL*
the
tent
:
two
farmers
talking
hoarsely
,
a
wagon
creaking
down
Main
*NL*
Street
,
the
crow
of
a
rooster
.
She
was
content
.
But
it
was
the
*NL*
contentment
of
the
lost
hunter
stopping
to
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
from
the
Chautauqua
itself
she
got
nothing
but
wind
and
chaff
and
*NL*
heavy
laughter
,
the
laughter
of
yokels
at
old
jokes
,
a
mirthless
and
*NL*
primitive
sound
like
the
cries
of
beasts
on
a
farm
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
several
instructors
in
the
condensed
university
's
*NL*
seven-day
course
:
*NL*
*NL*
Nine
lecturers
,
four
of
them
ex-ministers
,
and
one
an
ex-congressman
,
*NL*
all
of
them
delivering
``
inspirational
addresses
.
''
The
only
facts
or
*NL*
opinions
which
Carol
derived
from
them
were
:
Lincoln
was
a
celebrated
*NL*
president
of
the
United
States
,
but
in
his
youth
extremely
poor
.
James
*NL*
J.
Hill
was
the
best-known
railroad-man
of
the
West
,
and
in
his
youth
*NL*
extremely
poor
.
Honesty
and
courtesy
in
business
are
preferable
*NL*
to
boorishness
and
exposed
trickery
,
but
this
is
not
to
be
taken
*NL*
personally
,
since
all
persons
in
Gopher
Prairie
are
known
to
be
honest
*NL*
and
courteous
.
London
is
a
large
city
.
A
distinguished
statesman
once
*NL*
taught
Sunday
School
.
*NL*
*NL*
Four
``
entertainers
''
who
told
Jewish
stories
,
Irish
stories
,
German
*NL*
stories
,
Chinese
stories
,
and
Tennessee
mountaineer
stories
,
most
of
*NL*
which
Carol
had
heard
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
``
lady
elocutionist
''
who
recited
Kipling
and
imitated
children
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
lecturer
with
motion-pictures
of
an
Andean
exploration
;
excellent
*NL*
pictures
and
a
halting
narrative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
brass-bands
,
a
company
of
six
opera-singers
,
a
Hawaiian
sextette
,
*NL*
and
four
youths
who
played
saxophones
and
guitars
disguised
as
*NL*
wash-boards
.
The
most
applauded
pieces
were
those
,
such
as
the
``
Lucia
''
*NL*
inevitability
,
which
the
audience
had
heard
most
often
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
local
superintendent
,
who
remained
through
the
week
while
the
other
*NL*
enlighteners
went
to
other
Chautauquas
for
their
daily
performances
.
The
*NL*
superintendent
was
a
bookish
,
underfed
man
who
worked
hard
at
rousing
*NL*
artificial
enthusiasm
,
at
trying
to
make
the
audience
cheer
by
dividing
*NL*
them
into
competitive
squads
and
telling
them
that
they
were
intelligent
*NL*
and
made
splendid
communal
noises
.
He
gave
most
of
the
morning
lectures
,
*NL*
droning
with
equal
unhappy
facility
about
poetry
,
the
Holy
Land
,
and
the
*NL*
injustice
to
employers
in
any
system
of
profit-sharing
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
final
item
was
a
man
who
neither
lectured
,
inspired
,
nor
*NL*
entertained
;
a
plain
little
man
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
.
All
the
*NL*
other
speakers
had
confessed
,
``
I
can
not
keep
from
telling
the
citizens
*NL*
of
your
beautiful
city
that
none
of
the
talent
on
this
circuit
have
*NL*
found
a
more
charming
spot
or
more
enterprising
and
hospitable
people
.
''
*NL*
But
the
little
man
suggested
that
the
architecture
of
Gopher
Prairie
was
*NL*
haphazard
,
and
that
it
was
sottish
to
let
the
lake-front
be
monopolized
*NL*
by
the
cinder-heaped
wall
of
the
railroad
embankment
.
Afterward
the
*NL*
audience
grumbled
,
``
Maybe
that
guy
's
got
the
right
dope
,
but
what
's
the
*NL*
use
of
looking
on
the
dark
side
of
things
all
the
time
?
New
ideas
are
*NL*
first-rate
,
but
not
all
this
criticism
.
Enough
trouble
in
life
without
*NL*
looking
for
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
the
Chautauqua
,
as
Carol
saw
it
.
After
it
,
the
town
felt
proud
and
*NL*
educated
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
*NL*
Two
weeks
later
the
Great
War
smote
Europe
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
month
Gopher
Prairie
had
the
delight
of
shuddering
,
then
,
as
the
*NL*
war
settled
down
to
a
business
of
trench-fighting
,
they
forgot
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carol
talked
about
the
Balkans
,
and
the
possibility
of
a
German
*NL*
revolution
,
Kennicott
yawned
,
``
Oh
yes
,
it
's
a
great
old
scrap
,
but
it
's
*NL*
none
of
our
business
.
Folks
out
here
are
too
busy
growing
corn
to
monkey
*NL*
with
any
fool
war
that
those
foreigners
want
to
get
themselves
into
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Miles
Bjornstam
who
said
,
``
I
ca
n't
figure
it
out
.
I
'm
opposed
to
*NL*
wars
,
but
still
,
seems
like
Germany
has
got
to
be
licked
because
them
*NL*
Junkers
stands
in
the
way
of
progress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
calling
on
Miles
and
Bea
,
early
in
autumn
.
They
had
received
*NL*
her
with
cries
,
with
dusting
of
chairs
,
and
a
running
to
fetch
water
for
*NL*
coffee
.
Miles
stood
and
beamed
at
her
.
He
fell
often
and
joyously
into
*NL*
his
old
irreverence
about
the
lords
of
Gopher
Prairie
,
but
always
--
with
*NL*
a
certain
difficulty
--
he
added
something
decorous
and
appreciative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lots
of
people
have
come
to
see
you
,
have
n't
they
?
''
Carol
hinted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Bea
's
cousin
Tina
comes
in
right
along
,
and
the
foreman
at
the
*NL*
mill
,
and
--
Oh
,
we
have
good
times
.
Say
,
take
a
look
at
that
Bea
!
*NL*
Would
n't
you
think
she
was
a
canary-bird
,
to
listen
to
her
,
and
to
see
*NL*
that
Scandahoofian
tow-head
of
hers
?
But
say
,
know
what
she
is
?
She
's
*NL*
a
mother
hen
!
Way
she
fusses
over
me
--
way
she
makes
old
Miles
wear
a
*NL*
necktie
!
Hate
to
spoil
her
by
letting
her
hear
it
,
but
she
's
one
pretty
*NL*
darn
nice
--
nice
--
Hell
!
What
do
we
care
if
none
of
the
dirty
snobs
come
*NL*
and
call
?
We
've
got
each
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
worried
about
their
struggle
,
but
she
forgot
it
in
the
stress
of
*NL*
sickness
and
fear
.
For
that
autumn
she
knew
that
a
baby
was
coming
,
*NL*
that
at
last
life
promised
to
be
interesting
in
the
peril
of
the
great
*NL*
change
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
baby
was
coming
.
Each
morning
she
was
nauseated
,
chilly
,
bedraggled
,
*NL*
and
certain
that
she
would
never
again
be
attractive
;
each
twilight
*NL*
she
was
afraid
.
She
did
not
feel
exalted
,
but
unkempt
and
furious
.
The
*NL*
period
of
daily
sickness
crawled
into
an
endless
time
of
boredom
.
It
*NL*
became
difficult
for
her
to
move
about
,
and
she
raged
that
she
,
who
*NL*
had
been
slim
and
light-footed
,
should
have
to
lean
on
a
stick
,
and
be
*NL*
heartily
commented
upon
by
street
gossips
.
She
was
encircled
by
greasy
*NL*
eyes
.
Every
matron
hinted
,
``
Now
that
you
're
going
to
be
a
mother
,
*NL*
dearie
,
you
'll
get
over
all
these
ideas
of
yours
and
settle
down
.
''
*NL*
She
felt
that
willy-nilly
she
was
being
initiated
into
the
assembly
*NL*
of
housekeepers
;
with
the
baby
for
hostage
,
she
would
never
escape
;
*NL*
presently
she
would
be
drinking
coffee
and
rocking
and
talking
about
*NL*
diapers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
stand
fighting
them
.
I
'm
used
to
that
.
But
this
being
taken
in
,
*NL*
being
taken
as
a
matter
of
course
,
I
ca
n't
stand
it
--
and
I
must
stand
*NL*
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
alternately
detested
herself
for
not
appreciating
the
kindly
women
,
*NL*
and
detested
them
for
their
advice
:
lugubrious
hints
as
to
how
much
she
*NL*
would
suffer
in
labor
,
details
of
baby-hygiene
based
on
long
experience
*NL*
and
total
misunderstanding
,
superstitious
cautions
about
the
things
she
*NL*
must
eat
and
read
and
look
at
in
prenatal
care
for
the
baby
's
soul
,
and
*NL*
always
a
pest
of
simpering
baby-talk
.
Mrs.
Champ
Perry
bustled
in
to
*NL*
lend
``
Ben
Hur
,
''
as
a
preventive
of
future
infant
immorality
.
The
Widow
*NL*
Bogart
appeared
trailing
pinkish
exclamations
,
``
And
how
is
our
lovely
*NL*
`
ittle
muzzy
today
!
My
,
ai
n't
it
just
like
they
always
say
:
being
in
*NL*
a
Family
Way
does
make
the
girlie
so
lovely
,
just
like
a
Madonna
.
Tell
*NL*
me
--
''
Her
whisper
was
tinged
with
salaciousness
--
``
does
oo
feel
the
dear
*NL*
itsy
one
stirring
,
the
pledge
of
love
?
I
remember
with
Cy
,
of
course
he
*NL*
was
so
big
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
look
lovely
,
Mrs.
Bogart
.
My
complexion
is
rotten
,
and
my
hair
*NL*
is
coming
out
,
and
I
look
like
a
potato-bag
,
and
I
think
my
arches
are
*NL*
falling
,
and
he
is
n't
a
pledge
of
love
,
and
I
'm
afraid
he
WILL
look
like
*NL*
us
,
and
I
do
n't
believe
in
mother-devotion
,
and
the
whole
business
is
a
*NL*
confounded
nuisance
of
a
biological
process
,
''
remarked
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
the
baby
was
born
,
without
unusual
difficulty
:
a
boy
with
straight
*NL*
back
and
strong
legs
.
The
first
day
she
hated
him
for
the
tides
of
pain
*NL*
and
hopeless
fear
he
had
caused
;
she
resented
his
raw
ugliness
.
After
*NL*
that
she
loved
him
with
all
the
devotion
and
instinct
at
which
she
*NL*
had
scoffed
.
She
marveled
at
the
perfection
of
the
miniature
hands
as
*NL*
noisily
as
did
Kennicott
,
she
was
overwhelmed
by
the
trust
with
*NL*
which
the
baby
turned
to
her
;
passion
for
him
grew
with
each
unpoetic
*NL*
irritating
thing
she
had
to
do
for
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
named
Hugh
,
for
her
father
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hugh
developed
into
a
thin
healthy
child
with
a
large
head
and
straight
*NL*
delicate
hair
of
a
faint
brown
.
He
was
thoughtful
and
casual
--
a
*NL*
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
years
nothing
else
existed
.
She
did
not
,
as
the
cynical
matrons
*NL*
had
prophesied
,
``
give
up
worrying
about
the
world
and
other
folks
'
*NL*
babies
soon
as
she
got
one
of
her
own
to
fight
for
.
''
The
barbarity
of
*NL*
that
willingness
to
sacrifice
other
children
so
that
one
child
might
*NL*
have
too
much
was
impossible
to
her
.
But
she
would
sacrifice
herself
.
*NL*
She
understood
consecration
--
she
who
answered
Kennicott
's
hints
about
*NL*
having
Hugh
christened
:
``
I
refuse
to
insult
my
baby
and
myself
by
asking
*NL*
an
ignorant
young
man
in
a
frock
coat
to
sanction
him
,
to
permit
me
*NL*
to
have
him
!
I
refuse
to
subject
him
to
any
devil-chasing
rites
!
If
I
*NL*
did
n't
give
my
baby
--
MY
BABY
--
enough
sanctification
in
those
nine
hours
*NL*
of
hell
,
then
he
ca
n't
get
any
more
out
of
the
Reverend
Mr.
Zitterel
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Baptists
hardly
ever
christen
kids
.
I
was
kind
of
thinking
more
*NL*
about
Reverend
Warren
,
''
said
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hugh
was
her
reason
for
living
,
promise
of
accomplishment
in
the
future
,
*NL*
shrine
of
adoration
--
and
a
diverting
toy
.
``
I
thought
I
'd
be
a
dilettante
*NL*
mother
,
but
I
'm
as
dismayingly
natural
as
Mrs.
Bogart
,
''
she
boasted
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
--
years
Carol
was
a
part
of
the
town
;
as
much
one
of
Our
Young
*NL*
Mothers
as
Mrs.
McGanum
.
Her
opinionation
seemed
dead
;
she
had
no
*NL*
apparent
desire
for
escape
;
her
brooding
centered
on
Hugh
.
While
she
*NL*
wondered
at
the
pearl
texture
of
his
ear
she
exulted
,
``
I
feel
like
an
*NL*
old
woman
,
with
a
skin
like
sandpaper
,
beside
him
,
and
I
'm
glad
of
it
!
*NL*
He
is
perfect
.
He
shall
have
everything
.
He
sha
'n'
t
always
stay
here
in

Gopher
Prairie

I
wonder
which
is
really

Harvard

The
people
who
hemmed
her
in
had
been
brilliantly
reinforced
by
Mr.
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Whittier
N.
Smail
--
Kennicott
's
Uncle
Whittier
and
Aunt
Bessie

*NL*
*NL*
The
true
Main
Streetite
defines
a
relative
as
a
person
to
whose
house
*NL*
you
go
uninvited
,
to
stay
as
long
as
you
like
.
If
you
hear
that
Lym
Cass
*NL*
on
his
journey
East
has
spent
all
his
time
``
visiting
''
in
Oyster
Center
,
*NL*
it
does
not
mean
that
he
prefers
that
village
to
the
rest
of
New
*NL*
England
,
but
that
he
has
relatives
there
.
It
does
not
mean
that
he
has
*NL*
written
to
the
relatives
these
many
years
,
nor
that
they
have
ever
given
*NL*
signs
of
a
desire
to
look
upon
him
.
But
``
you
would
n't
expect
a
man
to
*NL*
go
and
spend
good
money
at
a
hotel
in
Boston
,
when
his
own
third
cousins
*NL*
live
right
in
the
same
state
,
would
you
?

*NL*
*NL*
When
the
Smails
sold
their
creamery
in
North
Dakota
they
visited
Mr.
*NL*
Smail
's
sister
,
Kennicott
's
mother
,
at
Lac-qui-Meurt
,
then
plodded
on
*NL*
to
Gopher
Prairie
to
stay
with
their
nephew
.
They
appeared
unannounced
,
*NL*
before
the
baby
was
born
,
took
their
welcome
for
granted
,
and
*NL*
immediately
began
to
complain
of
the
fact
that
their
room
faced
north
.
*NL*
*NL*
Uncle
Whittier
and
Aunt
Bessie
assumed
that
it
was
their
privilege
as
*NL*
relatives
to
laugh
at
Carol
,
and
their
duty
as
Christians
to
let
her
*NL*
know
how
absurd
her
``
notions
''
were
.
They
objected
to
the
food
,
to
*NL*
Oscarina
's
lack
of
friendliness
,
to
the
wind
,
the
rain
,
and
the
*NL*
immodesty
of
Carol
's
maternity
gowns
.
They
were
strong
and
enduring
;
for
*NL*
an
hour
at
a
time
they
could
go
on
heaving
questions
about
her
father
's
*NL*
income
,
about
her
theology
,
and
about
the
reason
why
she
had
not
put
on
*NL*
her
rubbers
when
she
had
gone
across
the
street
.
For
fussy
discussion
*NL*
they
had
a
rich
,
full
genius
,
and
their
example
developed
in
Kennicott
a
*NL*
tendency
to
the
same
form
of
affectionate
flaying
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Carol
was
so
indiscreet
as
to
murmur
that
she
had
a
small
headache
,
*NL*
instantly
the
two
Smails
and
Kennicott
were
at
it
.
Every
five
minutes
,
*NL*
every
time
she
sat
down
or
rose
or
spoke
to
Oscarina
,
they
twanged
,
``
Is
*NL*
your
head
better
now
?
Where
does
it
hurt
?
Do
n't
you
keep
hartshorn
in
*NL*
the
house
?
Did
n't
you
walk
too
far
today
?
Have
you
tried
hartshorn
?
*NL*
Do
n't
you
keep
some
in
the
house
so
it
will
be
handy
?
Does
it
feel
*NL*
better
now
?
How
does
it
feel
?
Do
your
eyes
hurt
,
too
?
What
time
do
you
*NL*
usually
get
to
bed
?
As
late
as
THAT
?
Well
!
How
does
it
feel
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
presence
Uncle
Whittier
snorted
at
Kennicott
,
``
Carol
get
these
*NL*
headaches
often
?
Huh
?
Be
better
for
her
if
she
did
n't
go
gadding
around
*NL*
to
all
these
bridge-whist
parties
,
and
took
some
care
of
herself
once
in
*NL*
a
while
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
kept
it
up
,
commenting
,
questioning
,
commenting
,
questioning
,
*NL*
till
her
determination
broke
and
she
bleated
,
``
For
heaven
's
SAKE
,
do
n't
*NL*
dis-CUSS
it
!
My
head
's
all
RIGHT
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
listened
to
the
Smails
and
Kennicott
trying
to
determine
by
*NL*
dialectics
whether
the
copy
of
the
Dauntless
,
which
Aunt
Bessie
wanted
*NL*
to
send
to
her
sister
in
Alberta
,
ought
to
have
two
or
four
cents
*NL*
postage
on
it
.
Carol
would
have
taken
it
to
the
drug
store
and
weighed
*NL*
it
,
but
then
she
was
a
dreamer
,
while
they
were
practical
people
-LRB-
as
*NL*
they
frequently
admitted
-RRB-
.
So
they
sought
to
evolve
the
postal
rate
from
*NL*
their
inner
consciousnesses
,
which
,
combined
with
entire
frankness
in
*NL*
thinking
aloud
,
was
their
method
of
settling
all
problems
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Smails
did
not
``
believe
in
all
this
nonsense
''
about
privacy
and
*NL*
reticence
.
When
Carol
left
a
letter
from
her
sister
on
the
table
,
she
*NL*
was
astounded
to
hear
from
Uncle
Whittier
,
``
I
see
your
sister
says
her
*NL*
husband
is
doing
fine
.
You
ought
to
go
see
her
oftener
.
I
asked
Will
*NL*
and
he
says
you
do
n't
go
see
her
very
often
.
My
!
You
ought
to
go
see
her
*NL*
oftener
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
If
Carol
was
writing
a
letter
to
a
classmate
,
or
planning
the
week
's
*NL*
menus
,
she
could
be
certain
that
Aunt
Bessie
would
pop
in
and
titter
,
*NL*
``
Now
do
n't
let
me
disturb
you
,
I
just
wanted
to
see
where
you
were
,
*NL*
do
n't
stop
,
I
'm
not
going
to
stay
only
a
second
.
I
just
wondered
if
*NL*
you
could
possibly
have
thought
that
I
did
n't
eat
the
onions
this
noon
*NL*
because
I
did
n't
think
they
were
properly
cooked
,
but
that
was
n't
the
*NL*
reason
at
all
,
it
was
n't
because
I
did
n't
think
they
were
well
cooked
,
*NL*
I
'm
sure
that
everything
in
your
house
is
always
very
dainty
and
nice
,
*NL*
though
I
do
think
that
Oscarina
is
careless
about
some
things
,
she
*NL*
does
n't
appreciate
the
big
wages
you
pay
her
,
and
she
is
so
cranky
,
all
*NL*
these
Swedes
are
so
cranky
,
I
do
n't
really
see
why
you
have
a
Swede
,
*NL*
but
--
But
that
was
n't
it
,
I
did
n't
eat
them
not
because
I
did
n't
think
*NL*
they
were
n't
cooked
proper
,
it
was
just
--
I
find
that
onions
do
n't
agree
*NL*
with
me
,
it
's
very
strange
,
ever
since
I
had
an
attack
of
biliousness
*NL*
one
time
,
I
have
found
that
onions
,
either
fried
onions
or
raw
ones
,
and
*NL*
Whittier
does
love
raw
onions
with
vinegar
and
sugar
on
them
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pure
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
discovering
that
the
one
thing
that
can
be
more
disconcerting
*NL*
than
intelligent
hatred
is
demanding
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
supposed
that
she
was
being
gracefully
dull
and
standardized
in
*NL*
the
Smails
'
presence
,
but
they
scented
the
heretic
,
and
with
*NL*
forward-stooping
delight
they
sat
and
tried
to
drag
out
her
ludicrous
*NL*
concepts
for
their
amusement
.
They
were
like
the
Sunday-afternoon
mob
*NL*
starting
at
monkeys
in
the
Zoo
,
poking
fingers
and
making
faces
and
*NL*
giggling
at
the
resentment
of
the
more
dignified
race
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
loose-lipped
,
superior
,
village
smile
Uncle
Whittier
hinted
,
*NL*
``
What
's
this
I
hear
about
your
thinking
Gopher
Prairie

Carrie

I
do
n't
know
where
folks
get
these
*NL*
new-fangled
ideas

Lots

farmers
in

getting
'em
these
days

*NL*
About
co-operation

Think
they
can
run
stores
better

Huh

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whit
and
I
did
n't
need
no
co-operation

long
as
we
was
farming

*NL*
triumphed
Aunt
Bessie
.
``
Carrie
,
tell
your
old
auntie

But
you

When

*NL*
*NL*
In
the
manner
of
one
who
has
just
beheld
a
two-headed
calf
they
repeated
*NL*
that
they
had
``
never
HEARD
such
funny
ideas
!
''
They
were
staggered
to
*NL*
learn
that
a
real
tangible
person
,
living
in
Minnesota
,
and
married
*NL*
to
their
own
flesh-and-blood
relation
,
could
apparently
believe
that
*NL*
divorce
may
not
always
be
immoral
;
that
illegitimate
children
do
not
*NL*
bear
any
special
and
guaranteed
form
of
curse
;
that
there
are
ethical
*NL*
authorities
outside
of
the
Hebrew
Bible
;
that
men
have
drunk
wine
yet
*NL*
not
died
in
the
gutter
;
that
the
capitalistic
system
of
distribution
and
*NL*
the
Baptist
wedding-ceremony
were
not
known
in
the
Garden
of
Eden
;
that
*NL*
mushrooms
are
as
edible
as
corn-beef
hash
;
that
the
word
``
dude
''
is
*NL*
no
longer
frequently
used
;
that
there
are
Ministers
of
the
Gospel
*NL*
who
accept
evolution
;
that
some
persons
of
apparent
intelligence
and
*NL*
business
ability
do
not
always
vote
the
Republican
ticket
straight
;
that
*NL*
it
is
not
a
universal
custom
to
wear
scratchy
flannels
next
the
skin
*NL*
in
winter
;
that
a
violin
is
not
inherently
more
immoral
than
a
chapel
*NL*
organ
;
that
some
poets
do
not
have
long
hair
;
and
that
Jews
are
not
*NL*
always
pedlers
or
pants-makers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
does
she
get
all
them
the
`
ries
?
''
marveled
Uncle
Whittier
Smail
;
*NL*
while
Aunt
Bessie
inquired
,
``
Do
you
suppose
there
's
many
folks
got
*NL*
notions
like
hers
?
My
!
If
there
are

''
and
her
tone
settled
the
fact
that
*NL*
there
were
not
,
``
I
just
do
n't
know
what
the
world
's
coming
to

*NL*
*NL*
Patiently
--
more
or
less
--
Carol
awaited
the
exquisite
day
when
they
would
*NL*
announce
departure
.
After
three
weeks
Uncle
Whittier
remarked
,
``
We
kinda
*NL*
like
Gopher
Prairie
.
Guess
maybe
we
'll
stay
here

We
'd
been
wondering
*NL*
what
we
'd
do
,
now
we
've
sold
the
creamery
and
my
farms
.
So
I
had
a
talk
*NL*
with
Ole
Jenson
about
his
grocery
,
and
I
guess
I
'll
buy
him
out
and
*NL*
storekeep
for
a
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
rebelled
.
Kennicott
soothed
her
:
``
Oh
,
we
wo
n't
see
much
of
them
.
*NL*
They
'll
have
their
own
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
resolved
to
be
so
chilly
that
they
would
stay
away
.
But
she
had
no
*NL*
talent
for
conscious
insolence
.
They
found
a
house
,
but
Carol
was
never
*NL*
safe
from
their
appearance
with
a
hearty
,
``
Thought
we
'd
drop
in
this
*NL*
evening
and
keep
you
from
being
lonely
.
Why
,
you
ai
n't
had
them
curtains
*NL*
washed
yet
!
''
Invariably
,
whenever
she
was
touched
by
the
realization
*NL*
that
it
was
they
who
were
lonely
,
they
wrecked
her
pitying
affection
by
*NL*
comments
--
questions
--
comments
--
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
immediately
became
friendly
with
all
of
their
own
race
,
with
the
*NL*
Luke
Dawsons
,
the
Deacon
Piersons
,
and
Mrs.
Bogart
;
and
brought
them
*NL*
along
in
the
evening
.
Aunt
Bessie
was
a
bridge
over
whom
the
older
*NL*
women
,
bearing
gifts
of
counsel
and
the
ignorance
of
experience
,
poured
*NL*
into
Carol
's
island
of
reserve
.
Aunt
Bessie
urged
the
good
Widow
Bogart
,
*NL*
``
Drop
in
and
see
Carrie
real
often
.
Young
folks
today
do
n't
understand
*NL*
housekeeping
like
we
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
showed
herself
perfectly
willing
to
be
an
associate
*NL*
relative
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
thinking
up
protective
insults
when
Kennicott
's
mother
came
*NL*
down
to
stay
with
Brother
Whittier
for
two
months
.
Carol
was
fond
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Kennicott
.
She
could
not
carry
out
her
insults
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
trapped
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
been
kidnaped
by
the
town
.
She
was
Aunt
Bessie
's
niece
,
and
she
*NL*
was
to
be
a
mother
.
She
was
expected
,
she
almost
expected
herself
,
to
*NL*
sit
forever
talking
of
babies
,
cooks
,
embroidery
stitches
,
the
price
of
*NL*
potatoes
,
and
the
tastes
of
husbands
in
the
matter
of
spinach
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
a
refuge
in
the
Jolly
Seventeen
.
She
suddenly
understood
that
*NL*
they
could
be
depended
upon
to
laugh
with
her
at
Mrs.
Bogart
,
and
she
*NL*
now
saw
Juanita
Haydock
's
gossip
not
as
vulgarity
but
as
gaiety
and
*NL*
remarkable
analysis
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
life
had
changed
,
even
before
Hugh
appeared
.
She
looked
forward
to
*NL*
the
next
bridge
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
and
the
security
of
whispering
*NL*
with
her
dear
friends
Maud
Dyer
and
Juanita
and
Mrs.
McGanum
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
part
of
the
town
.
Its
philosophy
and
its
feuds
dominated
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
no
longer
irritated
by
the
cooing
of
the
matrons
,
nor
by
their
*NL*
opinion
that
diet
did
n't
matter
so
long
as
the
Little
Ones
had
plenty
of
*NL*
lace
and
moist
kisses
,
but
she
concluded
that
in
the
care
of
babies
as
*NL*
in
politics
,
intelligence
was
superior
to
quotations
about
pansies
.
She
*NL*
liked
best
to
talk
about
Hugh
to
Kennicott
,
Vida
,
and
the
Bjornstams
.
*NL*
She
was
happily
domestic
when
Kennicott
sat
by
her
on
the
floor
,
to
*NL*
watch
baby
make
faces
.
She
was
delighted
when
Miles
,
speaking
as
one
man
*NL*
to
another
,
admonished
Hugh
,
``
I
would
n't
stand
them
skirts
if
I
was
you
.
*NL*
Come
on
.
Join
the
union
and
strike
.
Make
'em
give
you
pants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
parent
,
Kennicott
was
moved
to
establish
the
first
child-welfare
*NL*
week
held
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
Carol
helped
him
weigh
babies
and
*NL*
examine
their
throats
,
and
she
wrote
out
the
diets
for
mute
German
and
*NL*
Scandinavian
mothers
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aristocracy
of
Gopher
Prairie
,
even
the
wives
of
the
rival
doctors
,
*NL*
took
part
,
and
for
several
days
there
was
community
spirit
and
much
*NL*
uplift
.
But
this
reign
of
love
was
overthrown
when
the
prize
for
Best
*NL*
Baby
was
awarded
not
to
decent
parents
but
to
Bea
and
Miles
Bjornstam
!
*NL*
The
good
matrons
glared
at
Olaf
Bjornstam
,
with
his
blue
eyes
,
his
*NL*
honey-colored
hair
,
and
magnificent
back
,
and
they
remarked
,
``
Well
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
,
maybe
that
Swede
brat
is
as
healthy
as
your
husband
says
he
*NL*
is
,
but
let
me
tell
you
I
hate
to
think
of
the
future
that
awaits
any
*NL*
boy
with
a
hired
girl
for
a
mother
and
an
awful
irreligious
socialist
*NL*
for
a
pa
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
raged
,
but
so
violent
was
the
current
of
their
respectability
,
so
*NL*
persistent
was
Aunt
Bessie
in
running
to
her
with
their
blabber
,
that
*NL*
she
was
embarrassed
when
she
took
Hugh
to
play
with
Olaf
.
She
hated
*NL*
herself
for
it
,
but
she
hoped
that
no
one
saw
her
go
into
the
Bjornstam
*NL*
shanty
.
She
hated
herself
and
the
town
's
indifferent
cruelty
when
she
*NL*
saw
Bea
's
radiant
devotion
to
both
babies
alike
;
when
she
saw
Miles
*NL*
staring
at
them
wistfully
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
saved
money
,
had
quit
Elder
's
planing-mill
and
started
a
dairy
*NL*
on
a
vacant
lot
near
his
shack
.
He
was
proud
of
his
three
cows
and
sixty
*NL*
chickens
,
and
got
up
nights
to
nurse
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
be
a
big
farmer
before
you
can
bat
an
eye
!
I
tell
you
that
young
*NL*
fellow
Olaf
is
going
to
go
East
to
college
along
with
the
Haydock
kids
.
*NL*
Uh
--
Lots
of
folks
dropping
in
to
chin
with
Bea
and
me
now
.
Say
!
Ma
*NL*
Bogart
come
in
one
day
!
She
was
--
I
liked
the
old
lady
fine
.
And
the
*NL*
mill
foreman
comes
in
right
along
.
Oh
,
we
got
lots
of
friends
.
You
bet
!

*NL*
Though
the
town
seemed
to
Carol
to
change
no
more
than
the
surrounding
*NL*
fields
,
there
was
a
constant
shifting
,
these
three
years
.
The
citizen
of
*NL*
the
prairie
drifts
always
westward
.
It
may
be
because
he
is
the
heir
of
*NL*
ancient
migrations
--
and
it
may
be
because
he
finds
within
his
own
*NL*
spirit
so
little
adventure
that
he
is
driven
to
seek
it
by
changing
his
*NL*
horizon
.
The
towns
remain
unvaried
,
yet
the
individual
faces
alter
*NL*
like
classes
in
college
.
The
Gopher
Prairie
jeweler
sells
out
,
for
no
*NL*
discernible
reason
,
and
moves
on
to
Alberta
or
the
state
of
Washington
,
*NL*
to
open
a
shop
precisely
like
his
former
one
,
in
a
town
precisely
like
*NL*
the
one
he
has
left
.
There
is
,
except
among
professional
men
and
the
*NL*
wealthy
,
small
permanence
either
of
residence
or
occupation
.
A
man
*NL*
becomes
farmer
,
grocer
,
town
policeman
,
garageman
,
restaurant-owner
,
*NL*
postmaster
,
insurance-agent
,
and
farmer
all
over
again
,
and
the
*NL*
community
more
or
less
patiently
suffers
from
his
lack
of
knowledge
in
*NL*
each
of
his
experiments
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ole
Jenson
the
grocer
and
Dahl
the
butcher
moved
on
to
South
Dakota
*NL*
and
Idaho
.
Luke
and
Mrs.
Dawson
picked
up
ten
thousand
acres
of
prairie
*NL*
soil
,
in
the
magic
portable
form
of
a
small
check
book
,
and
went
to
*NL*
Pasadena
,
to
a
bungalow
and
sunshine
and
cafeterias
.
Chet
Dashaway
sold
*NL*
his
furniture
and
undertaking
business
and
wandered
to
Los
Angeles
,
*NL*
where
,
the
Dauntless
reported
,
``
Our
good
friend
Chester
has
accepted
a
*NL*
fine
position
with
a
real-estate
firm
,
and
his
wife
has
in
the
charming
*NL*
social
circles
of
the
Queen
City
of
the
Southwestland
that
same
*NL*
popularity
which
she
enjoyed
in
our
own
society
sets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Rita
Simons
was
married
to
Terry
Gould
,
and
rivaled
Juanita
Haydock
as
*NL*
the
gayest
of
the
Young
Married
Set
.
But
Juanita
also
acquired
merit
.
*NL*
Harry
's
father
died
,
Harry
became
senior
partner
in
the
Bon
Ton
Store
,
*NL*
and
Juanita
was
more
acidulous
and
shrewd
and
cackling
than
ever
.
She
*NL*
bought
an
evening
frock
,
and
exposed
her
collar-bone
to
the
wonder
of
*NL*
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
and
talked
of
moving
to
Minneapolis
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
defend
her
position
against
the
new
Mrs.
Terry
Gould
she
sought
to
*NL*
attach
Carol
to
her
faction
by
giggling
that
``
SOME
folks
might
call
Rita
*NL*
innocent
,
but
I
've
got
a
hunch
that
she
is
n't
half
as
ignorant
of
things
*NL*
as
brides
are
supposed
to
be
--
and
of
course
Terry
is
n't
one-two-three
as
*NL*
a
doctor
alongside
of
your
husband
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
herself
would
gladly
have
followed
Mr.
Ole
Jenson
,
and
migrated
*NL*
even
to
another
Main
Street
;
flight
from
familiar
tedium
to
new
tedium
*NL*
would
have
for
a
time
the
outer
look
and
promise
of
adventure
.
She
*NL*
hinted
to
Kennicott
of
the
probable
medical
advantages
of
Montana
and
*NL*
Oregon
.
She
knew
that
he
was
satisfied
with
Gopher
Prairie
,
but
it
gave
*NL*
her
vicarious
hope
to
think
of
going
,
to
ask
for
railroad
folders
at
the
*NL*
station
,
to
trace
the
maps
with
a
restless
forefinger
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
to
the
casual
eye
she
was
not
discontented
,
she
was
not
an
abnormal
*NL*
and
distressing
traitor
to
the
faith
of
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
settled
citizen
believes
that
the
rebel
is
constantly
in
a
stew
of
*NL*
complaining
and
,
hearing
of
a
Carol
Kennicott
,
he
gasps
,
``
What
an
*NL*
awful
person
!
She
must
be
a
Holy
Terror
to
live
with
!
Glad
MY
folks
are
*NL*
satisfied
with
things
way
they
are
!
''
Actually
,
it
was
not
so
much
as
*NL*
five
minutes
a
day
that
Carol
devoted
to
lonely
desires
.
It
is
*NL*
probable
that
the
agitated
citizen
has
within
his
circle
at
least
one
*NL*
inarticulate
rebel
with
aspirations
as
wayward
as
Carol
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
presence
of
the
baby
had
made
her
take
Gopher
Prairie
and
the
brown
*NL*
house
seriously
,
as
natural
places
of
residence
.
She
pleased
Kennicott
*NL*
by
being
friendly
with
the
complacent
maturity
of
Mrs.
Clark
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Elder
,
and
when
she
had
often
enough
been
in
conference
upon
the
Elders
'
*NL*
new
Cadillac
car
,
or
the
job
which
the
oldest
Clark
boy
had
taken
in
*NL*
the
office
of
the
flour-mill
,
these
topics
became
important
,
things
to
*NL*
follow
up
day
by
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
nine-tenths
of
her
emotion
concentrated
upon
Hugh
,
she
did
not
*NL*
criticize
shops
,
streets
,
acquaintances
...
this
year
or
two
.
She
*NL*
hurried
to
Uncle
Whittier
's
store
for
a
package
of
corn-flakes
,
she
*NL*
abstractedly
listened
to
Uncle
Whittier
's
denunciation
of
Martin
*NL*
Mahoney
for
asserting
that
the
wind
last
Tuesday
had
been
south
and
not
*NL*
southwest
,
she
came
back
along
streets
that
held
no
surprises
nor
the
*NL*
startling
faces
of
strangers
.
Thinking
of
Hugh
's
teething
all
the
way
,
*NL*
she
did
not
reflect
that
this
store
,
these
drab
blocks
,
made
up
all
her
*NL*
background
.
She
did
her
work
,
and
she
triumphed
over
winning
from
the
*NL*
Clarks
at
five
hundred
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
most
considerable
event
of
the
two
years
after
the
birth
of
Hugh
*NL*
occurred
when
Vida
Sherwin
resigned
from
the
high
school
and
was
*NL*
married
.
Carol
was
her
attendant
,
and
as
the
wedding
was
at
the
*NL*
Episcopal
Church
,
all
the
women
wore
new
kid
slippers
and
long
white
kid
*NL*
gloves
,
and
looked
refined
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
years
Carol
had
been
little
sister
to
Vida
,
and
had
never
in
the
*NL*
least
known
to
what
degree
Vida
loved
her
and
hated
her
and
in
curious
*NL*
strained
ways
was
bound
to
her
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
GRAY
steel
that
seems
unmoving
because
it
spins
so
fast
in
the
balanced
*NL*
fly-wheel
,
gray
snow
in
an
avenue
of
elms
,
gray
dawn
with
the
sun
behind
*NL*
it
--
this
was
the
gray
of
Vida
Sherwin
's
life
at
thirty-six
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
small
and
active
and
sallow
;
her
yellow
hair
was
faded
,
and
*NL*
looked
dry
;
her
blue
silk
blouses
and
modest
lace
collars
and
high
black
*NL*
shoes
and
sailor
hats
were
as
literal
and
uncharming
as
a
schoolroom
*NL*
desk
;
but
her
eyes
determined
her
appearance
,
revealed
her
as
a
*NL*
personage
and
a
force
,
indicated
her
faith
in
the
goodness
and
purpose
*NL*
of
everything
.
They
were
blue
,
and
they
were
never
still
;
they
expressed
*NL*
amusement
,
pity
,
enthusiasm
.
If
she
had
been
seen
in
sleep
,
with
the
*NL*
wrinkles
beside
her
eyes
stilled
and
the
creased
lids
hiding
the
radiant
*NL*
irises
,
she
would
have
lost
her
potency
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
born
in
a
hill-smothered
Wisconsin
village
where
her
father
*NL*
was
a
prosy
minister
;
she
labored
through
a
sanctimonious
college
;
she
*NL*
taught
for
two
years
in
an
iron-range
town
of
blurry-faced
Tatars
and
*NL*
Montenegrins
,
and
wastes
of
ore
,
and
when
she
came
to
Gopher
Prairie
,
*NL*
its
trees
and
the
shining
spaciousness
of
the
wheat
prairie
made
her
*NL*
certain
that
she
was
in
paradise
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
admitted
to
her
fellow-teachers
that
the
schoolbuilding
was
*NL*
slightly
damp
,
but
she
insisted
that
the
rooms
were
``
arranged
so
*NL*
conveniently
--
and
then
that
bust
of
President
McKinley
at
the
head
of
*NL*
the
stairs
,
it
's
a
lovely
art-work
,
and
is
n't
it
an
inspiration
to
have
*NL*
the
brave
,
honest
,
martyr
president
to
think
about
!
''
She
taught
French
,
*NL*
English
,
and
history
,
and
the
Sophomore
Latin
class
,
which
dealt
in
*NL*
matters
of
a
metaphysical
nature
called
Indirect
Discourse
and
the
*NL*
Ablative
Absolute
.
Each
year
she
was
reconvinced
that
the
pupils
were
*NL*
beginning
to
learn
more
quickly
.
She
spent
four
winters
in
building
up
*NL*
the
Debating
Society
,
and
when
the
debate
really
was
lively
one
Friday
*NL*
afternoon
,
and
the
speakers
of
pieces
did
not
forget
their
lines
,
she
*NL*
felt
rewarded
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
lived
an
engrossed
useful
life
,
and
seemed
as
cool
and
simple
as
an
*NL*
apple
.
But
secretly
she
was
creeping
among
fears
,
longing
,
and
guilt
.
*NL*
She
knew
what
it
was
,
but
she
dared
not
name
it
.
She
hated
even
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
word
``
sex
.
''
When
she
dreamed
of
being
a
woman
of
the
harem
,
*NL*
with
great
white
warm
limbs
,
she
awoke
to
shudder
,
defenseless
in
*NL*
the
dusk
of
her
room
.
She
prayed
to
Jesus
,
always
to
the
Son
of
God
,
*NL*
offering
him
the
terrible
power
of
her
adoration
,
addressing
him
as
the
*NL*
eternal
lover
,
growing
passionate
,
exalted
,
large
,
as
she
contemplated
*NL*
his
splendor
.
Thus
she
mounted
to
endurance
and
surcease
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
day
,
rattling
about
in
many
activities
,
she
was
able
to
ridicule
her
*NL*
blazing
nights
of
darkness
.
With
spurious
cheerfulness
she
announced
*NL*
everywhere
,
``
I
guess
I
'm
a
born
spinster
,
''
and
``
No
one
will
ever
marry
*NL*
a
plain
schoolma'am
like
me
,
''
and
``
You
men
,
great
big
noisy
bothersome
*NL*
creatures
,
we
women
would
n't
have
you
round
the
place
,
dirtying
up
nice
*NL*
clean
rooms
,
if
it
was
n't
that
you
have
to
be
petted
and
guided
.
We
just
*NL*
ought
to
say
`
Scat
!
'
to
all
of
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
when
a
man
held
her
close
at
a
dance
,
even
when
``
Professor
''
*NL*
George
Edwin
Mott
patted
her
hand
paternally
as
they
considered
the
*NL*
naughtinesses
of
Cy
Bogart
,
she
quivered
,
and
reflected
how
superior
she
*NL*
was
to
have
kept
her
virginity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
autumn
of
1911
,
a
year
before
Dr.
Will
Kennicott
was
married
,
*NL*
Vida
was
his
partner
at
a
five-hundred
tournament
.
She
was
thirty-four
*NL*
then
;
Kennicott
about
thirty-six
.
To
her
he
was
a
superb
,
boyish
,
*NL*
diverting
creature
;
all
the
heroic
qualities
in
a
manly
magnificent
*NL*
body
.
They
had
been
helping
the
hostess
to
serve
the
Waldorf
salad
and
*NL*
coffee
and
gingerbread
.
They
were
in
the
kitchen
,
side
by
side
on
a
*NL*
bench
,
while
the
others
ponderously
supped
in
the
room
beyond
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
was
masculine
and
experimental
.
He
stroked
Vida
's
hand
,
he
put
*NL*
his
arm
carelessly
about
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
!
''
she
said
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
a
cunning
thing
,
''
he
offered
,
patting
the
back
of
her
shoulder
*NL*
in
an
exploratory
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
strained
away
,
she
longed
to
move
nearer
to
him
.
He
bent
over
,
*NL*
looked
at
her
knowingly
.
She
glanced
down
at
his
left
hand
as
it
touched
*NL*
her
knee
.
She
sprang
up
,
started
noisily
and
needlessly
to
wash
the
*NL*
dishes
.
He
helped
her
.
He
was
too
lazy
to
adventure
further
--
and
too
*NL*
used
to
women
in
his
profession
.
She
was
grateful
for
the
impersonality
*NL*
of
his
talk
.
It
enabled
her
to
gain
control
.
She
knew
that
she
had
*NL*
skirted
wild
thoughts
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
month
after
,
on
a
sleighing-party
,
under
the
buffalo
robes
in
the
*NL*
bob-sled
,
he
whispered
,
``
You
pretend
to
be
a
grown-up
schoolteacher
,
but
*NL*
you
're
nothing
but
a
kiddie
.
''
His
arm
was
about
her
.
She
resisted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
you
like
the
poor
lonely
bachelor
?
''
he
yammered
in
a
fatuous
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
n't
!
You
do
n't
care
for
me
in
the
least
.
You
're
just
practising
*NL*
on
me
.

``
I

not
of

be

*NL*
either

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
persistently
drew
her
toward
him
.
She
clutched
his
arm
.
Then
she
*NL*
threw
off
the
robe
,
climbed
out
of
the
sled
,
raced
after
it
with
Harry
*NL*
Haydock
.
At
the
dance
which
followed
the
sleigh-ride
Kennicott
was
*NL*
devoted
to
the
watery
prettiness
of
Maud
Dyer
,
and
Vida
was
noisily
*NL*
interested
in
getting
up
a
Virginia
Reel
.
Without
seeming
to
watch
*NL*
Kennicott
,
she
knew
that
he
did
not
once
look
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
of
her
first
love-affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
no
sign
of
remembering
that
he
was
``
terribly
fond
.
''
She
waited
*NL*
for
him
;
she
reveled
in
longing
,
and
in
a
sense
of
guilt
because
she
*NL*
longed
.
She
told
herself
that
she
did
not
want
part
of
him
;
unless
he
*NL*
gave
her
all
his
devotion
she
would
never
let
him
touch
her
;
and
when
*NL*
she
found
that
she
was
probably
lying
,
she
burned
with
scorn
.
She
fought
*NL*
it
out
in
prayer
.
She
knelt
in
a
pink
flannel
nightgown
,
her
thin
hair
*NL*
down
her
back
,
her
forehead
as
full
of
horror
as
a
mask
of
tragedy
,
*NL*
while
she
identified
her
love
for
the
Son
of
God
with
her
love
for
a
*NL*
mortal
,
and
wondered
if
any
other
woman
had
ever
been
so
sacrilegious
.
*NL*
She
wanted
to
be
a
nun
and
observe
perpetual
adoration
.
She
bought
a
*NL*
rosary
,
but
she
had
been
so
bitterly
reared
as
a
Protestant
that
she
*NL*
could
not
bring
herself
to
use
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
none
of
her
intimates
in
the
school
and
in
the
boarding-house
knew
*NL*
of
her
abyss
of
passion
.
They
said
she
was
``
so
optimistic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
heard
that
Kennicott
was
to
marry
a
girl
,
pretty
,
young
,
and
*NL*
imposingly
from
the
Cities
,
Vida
despaired
.
She
congratulated
Kennicott
;
*NL*
carelessly
ascertained
from
him
the
hour
of
marriage
.
At
that
hour
,
*NL*
sitting
in
her
room
,
Vida
pictured
the
wedding
in
St.
Paul
.
Full
of
an
*NL*
ecstasy
which
horrified
her
,
she
followed
Kennicott
and
the
girl
who
had
*NL*
stolen
her
place
,
followed
them
to
the
train
,
through
the
evening
,
the
*NL*
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
relieved
when
she
had
worked
out
a
belief
that
she
was
n't
really
*NL*
shameful
,
that
there
was
a
mystical
relation
between
herself
and
Carol
,
*NL*
so
that
she
was
vicariously
yet
veritably
with
Kennicott
,
and
had
the
*NL*
right
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
Carol
during
the
first
five
minutes
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
*NL*
stared
at
the
passing
motor
,
at
Kennicott
and
the
girl
beside
him
.
In
*NL*
that
fog
world
of
transference
of
emotion
Vida
had
no
normal
jealousy
*NL*
but
a
conviction
that
,
since
through
Carol
she
had
received
Kennicott
's
*NL*
love
,
then
Carol
was
a
part
of
her
,
an
astral
self
,
a
heightened
and
*NL*
more
beloved
self
.
She
was
glad
of
the
girl
's
charm
,
of
the
smooth
black
*NL*
hair
,
the
airy
head
and
young
shoulders
.
But
she
was
suddenly
angry
.
*NL*
Carol
glanced
at
her
for
a
quarter-second
,
but
looked
past
her
,
at
an
*NL*
old
roadside
barn
.
If
she
had
made
the
great
sacrifice
,
at
least
she
*NL*
expected
gratitude
and
recognition
,
Vida
raged
,
while
her
conscious
*NL*
schoolroom
mind
fussily
begged
her
to
control
this
insanity
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
her
first
call
half
of
her
wanted
to
welcome
a
fellow
reader
of
*NL*
books
;
the
other
half
itched
to
find
out
whether
Carol
knew
anything
*NL*
about
Kennicott
's
former
interest
in
herself
.
She
discovered
that
Carol
*NL*
was
not
aware
that
he
had
ever
touched
another
woman
's
hand
.
Carol
was
*NL*
an
amusing
,
naive
,
curiously
learned
child
.
While
Vida
was
most
actively
*NL*
describing
the
glories
of
the
Thanatopsis
,
and
complimenting
this
*NL*
librarian
on
her
training
as
a
worker
,
she
was
fancying
that
this
girl
*NL*
was
the
child
born
of
herself
and
Kennicott
;
and
out
of
that
symbolizing
*NL*
she
had
a
comfort
she
had
not
known
for
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
came
home
,
after
supper
with
the
Kennicotts
and
Guy
Pollock
,
*NL*
she
had
a
sudden
and
rather
pleasant
backsliding
from
devotion
.
She
*NL*
bustled
into
her
room
,
she
slammed
her
hat
on
the
bed
,
and
chattered
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
CARE
!
I
'm
a
lot
like
her
--
except
a
few
years
older
.
I
'm
light
and
*NL*
quick
,
too
,
and
I
can
talk
just
as
well
as
she
can
,
and
I
'm
sure
--
Men
*NL*
are
such
fools
.
I
'd
be
ten
times
as
sweet
to
make
love
to
as
that
dreamy
*NL*
baby
.
And
I
AM
as
good-looking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
she
sat
on
the
bed
and
stared
at
her
thin
thighs
,
defiance
oozed
*NL*
away
.
She
mourned
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'm
not
.
Dear
God
,
how
we
fool
ourselves
!
I
pretend
I
'm
*NL*
`
spiritual
.
'
I
pretend
my
legs
are
graceful
.
They
are
n't
.
They
're
*NL*
skinny
.
Old-maidish
.
I
hate
it
!
I
hate
that
impertinent
young
woman
!
A
*NL*
selfish
cat
,
taking
his
love
for
granted
...
No
,
she
's
adorable
...
*NL*
I
do
n't
think
she
ought
to
be
so
friendly
with
Guy
Pollock
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
year
Vida
loved
Carol
,
longed
to
and
did
not
pry
into
the
details
*NL*
of
her
relations
with
Kennicott
,
enjoyed
her
spirit
of
play
as
expressed
*NL*
in
childish
tea-parties
,
and
,
with
the
mystic
bond
between
them
*NL*
forgotten
,
was
healthily
vexed
by
Carol
's
assumption
that
she
was
a
*NL*
sociological
messiah
come
to
save
Gopher
Prairie
.
This
last
facet
of
*NL*
Vida
's
thought
was
the
one
which
,
after
a
year
,
was
most
often
turned
to
*NL*
the
light
.
In
a
testy
way
she
brooded
,
``
These
people
that
want
to
change
*NL*
everything
all
of
a
sudden
without
doing
any
work
,
make
me
tired
!
Here
I
*NL*
have
to
go
and
work
for
four
years
,
picking
out
the
pupils
for
*NL*
debates
,
and
drilling
them
,
and
nagging
at
them
to
get
them
to
look
up
*NL*
references
,
and
begging
them
to
choose
their
own
subjects
--
four
years
,
*NL*
to
get
up
a
couple
of
good
debates
!
And
she
comes
rushing
in
,
and
*NL*
expects
in
one
year
to
change
the
whole
town
into
a
lollypop
paradise
*NL*
with
everybody
stopping
everything
else
to
grow
tulips
and
drink
tea
.
*NL*
And
it
's
a
comfy
homey
old
town
,
too
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
such
an
outburst
after
each
of
Carol
's
campaigns
--
for
better
*NL*
Thanatopsis
programs
,
for
Shavian
plays
,
for
more
human
schools
--
but
she
*NL*
never
betrayed
herself
,
and
always
she
was
penitent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
was
,
and
always
would
be
,
a
reformer
,
a
liberal
.
She
believed
that
*NL*
details
could
excitingly
be
altered
,
but
that
things-in-general
were
*NL*
comely
and
kind
and
immutable
.
Carol
was
,
without
understanding
or
*NL*
accepting
it
,
a
revolutionist
,
a
radical
,
and
therefore
possessed
of
*NL*
``
constructive
ideas
,
''
which
only
the
destroyer
can
have
,
since
the
*NL*
reformer
believes
that
all
the
essential
constructing
has
already
been
*NL*
done
.
After
years
of
intimacy
it
was
this
unexpressed
opposition
more
*NL*
than
the
fancied
loss
of
Kennicott
's
love
which
held
Vida
irritably
*NL*
fascinated
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
birth
of
Hugh
revived
the
transcendental
emotion
.
She
was
*NL*
indignant
that
Carol
should
not
be
utterly
fulfilled
in
having
borne
*NL*
Kennicott
's
child
.
She
admitted
that
Carol
seemed
to
have
affection
and
*NL*
immaculate
care
for
the
baby
,
but
she
began
to
identify
herself
now
with
*NL*
Kennicott
,
and
in
this
phase
to
feel
that
she
had
endured
quite
too
much
*NL*
from
Carol
's
instability
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
recalled
certain
other
women
who
had
come
from
the
Outside
and
had
*NL*
not
appreciated
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
remembered
the
rector
's
wife
who
had
*NL*
been
chilly
to
callers
and
who
was
rumored
throughout
the
town
to
*NL*
have
said
,
``
Re-ah-ly
I
caw
n't
endure
this
bucolic
heartiness
in
the
*NL*
responses
.
''
The
woman
was
positively
known
to
have
worn
handkerchiefs
in
*NL*
her
bodice
as
padding
--
oh
,
the
town
had
simply
roared
at
her
.
Of
course
*NL*
the
rector
and
she
were
got
rid
of
in
a
few
months
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
there
was
the
mysterious
woman
with
the
dyed
hair
and
penciled
*NL*
eyebrows
,
who
wore
tight
English
dresses
,
like
basques
,
who
smelled
of
*NL*
stale
musk
,
who
flirted
with
the
men
and
got
them
to
advance
money
*NL*
for
her
expenses
in
a
lawsuit
,
who
laughed
at
Vida
's
reading
at
a
*NL*
school-entertainment
,
and
went
off
owing
a
hotel-bill
and
the
three
*NL*
hundred
dollars
she
had
borrowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
insisted
that
she
loved
Carol
,
but
with
some
satisfaction
she
*NL*
compared
her
to
these
traducers
of
the
town
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
had
enjoyed
Raymie
Wutherspoon
's
singing
in
the
Episcopal
choir
;
*NL*
she
had
thoroughly
reviewed
the
weather
with
him
at
Methodist
sociables
*NL*
and
in
the
Bon
Ton
.
But
she
did
not
really
know
him
till
she
moved
to
*NL*
Mrs.
Gurrey
's
boarding-house
.
It
was
five
years
after
her
affair
with
*NL*
Kennicott
.
She
was
thirty-nine
,
Raymie
perhaps
a
year
younger
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
to
him
,
and
sincerely
,
``
My
!
You
can
do
anything
,
with
your
*NL*
brains
and
tact
and
that
heavenly
voice
.
You
were
so
good
in
`
The
Girl
*NL*
from
Kankakee
.
'
You
made
me
feel
terribly
stupid
.
If
you
'd
gone
on
the
*NL*
stage
,
I
believe
you
'd
be
just
as
good
as
anybody
in
Minneapolis
.
But
*NL*
still
,
I
'm
not
sorry
you
stuck
to
business
.
It
's
such
a
constructive
*NL*
career
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
really
think
so
?
''
yearned
Raymie
,
across
the
apple-sauce
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
that
either
of
them
had
found
a
dependable
*NL*
intellectual
companionship
.
They
looked
down
on
Willis
Woodford
the
*NL*
bank-clerk
,
and
his
anxious
babycentric
wife
,
the
silent
Lyman
Casses
,
*NL*
the
slangy
traveling
man
,
and
the
rest
of
Mrs.
Gurrey
's
unenlightened
*NL*
guests
.
They
sat
opposite
,
and
they
sat
late
.
They
were
exhilarated
to
*NL*
find
that
they
agreed
in
confession
of
faith
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
like
Sam
Clark
and
Harry
Haydock
are
n't
earnest
about
music
and
*NL*
pictures
and
eloquent
sermons
and
really
refined
movies
,
but
then
,
on
*NL*
the
other
hand
,
people
like
Carol
Kennicott
put
too
much
stress
on
all
*NL*
this
art
.
Folks
ought
to
appreciate
lovely
things
,
but
just
the
same
,
*NL*
they
got
to
be
practical
and
--
they
got
to
look
at
things
in
a
practical
*NL*
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Smiling
,
passing
each
other
the
pressed-glass
pickle-dish
,
seeing
Mrs.
*NL*
Gurrey
's
linty
supper-cloth
irradiated
by
the
light
of
intimacy
,
Vida
*NL*
and
Raymie
talked
about
Carol
's
rose-colored
turban
,
Carol
's
sweetness
,
*NL*
Carol
's
new
low
shoes
,
Carol
's
erroneous
theory
that
there
was
no
need
*NL*
of
strict
discipline
in
school
,
Carol
's
amiability
in
the
Bon
Ton
,
*NL*
Carol
's
flow
of
wild
ideas

which
,
honestly
,
just
simply
made
you

nervous
trying

keep
track
of
them

the
fact

there
were
n't
any
of
these
new

as
nice
as
``

*NL*

the
way
Raymie
stood
up
to
Juanita
Haydock
when
she
came
into
the

store
and
tried
to
run
things

he
as

told

Dr.

always
drove

reckless

almost
all

drove

once
beheld

as
a
thin
man
with
spectacles
,
mournful
*NL*
drawn-out
face
,
and
colorless
stiff
hair
.
Now
she
noted
that
his
jaw
was
*NL*
square
,
that
his
long
hands
moved
quickly
and
were
bleached
in
a
refined
*NL*
manner
,
and
that
his
trusting
eyes
indicated
that
he
had
``
led
a
clean
*NL*
life
.
''
She
began
to
call
him
``
Ray
,
''
and
to
bounce
in
defense
of
his
*NL*
unselfishness
and
thoughtfulness
every
time
Juanita
Haydock
or
Rita
*NL*
Gould
giggled
about
him
at
the
Jolly
Seventeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
Sunday
afternoon
of
late
autumn
they
walked
down
to
Lake
*NL*
Minniemashie
.
Ray
said
that
he
would
like
to
see
the
ocean
;
it
must
be
a
*NL*
grand
sight
;
it
must
be
much
grander
than
a
lake
,
even
a
great
big
lake
.
*NL*
Vida
had
seen
it
,
she
stated
modestly
;
she
had
seen
it
on
a
summer
trip
*NL*
to
Cape
Cod
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
been
clear
to
Cape
Cod
?
Massachusetts
?
I
knew
you
'd
traveled
,
*NL*
but
I
never
realized
you
'd
been
that
far
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Made
taller
and
younger
by
his
interest
she
poured
out
,
``
Oh
my
yes
.
*NL*
It
was
a
wonderful
trip
.
So
many
points
of
interest
through
*NL*
Massachusetts
--
historical
.
There
's
Lexington
where
we
turned
back
*NL*
the
redcoats
,
and
Longfellow
's
home
at
Cambridge
,
and
Cape
Cod
--
just
*NL*
everything
--
fishermen
and
whale-ships
and
sand-dunes
and
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
wished
that
she
had
a
little
cane
to
carry
.
He
broke
off
a
willow
*NL*
branch
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
,
you
're
strong
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
very
.
I
wish
there
was
a
Y.
M.
C.
A.
here
,
so
I
could
take
up
*NL*
regular
exercise
.
I
used
to
think
I
could
do
pretty
good
acrobatics
,
if
*NL*
I
had
a
chance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
could
.
You
're
unusually
lithe
,
for
a
large
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
,
not
so
very
.
But
I
wish
we
had
a
Y.
M
.
It
would
be
dandy
to
have
*NL*
lectures
and
everything
,
and
I
'd
like
to
take
a
class
in
improving
*NL*
the
memory
--
I
believe
a
fellow
ought
to
go
on
educating
himself
and
*NL*
improving
his
mind
even
if
he
is
in
business
,
do
n't
you
,
Vida
--
I
guess
*NL*
I
'm
kind
of
fresh
to
call
you
`
Vida
'
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
calling
you
`
Ray
'
for
weeks
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
wondered
why
she
sounded
tart
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
helped
her
down
the
bank
to
the
edge
of
the
lake
but
dropped
her
hand
*NL*
abruptly
,
and
as
they
sat
on
a
willow
log
and
he
brushed
her
sleeve
,
he
*NL*
delicately
moved
over
and
murmured
,
``
Oh
,
excuse
me
--
accident
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stared
at
the
mud-browned
chilly
water
,
the
floating
gray
reeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look
so
thoughtful
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
threw
out
her
hands
.
``
I
am
!
Will
you
kindly
tell
me
what
's
the
use
*NL*
of
--
anything
!
Oh
,
do
n't
mind
me
.
I
'm
a
moody
old
hen
.
Tell
me
about
your
*NL*
plan
for
getting
a
partnership
in
the
Bon
Ton
.
I
do
think
you
're
right
:
*NL*
Harry
Haydock
and
that
mean
old
Simons
ought
to
give
you
one
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hymned
the
old
unhappy
wars
in
which
he
had
been
Achilles
and
the
*NL*
mellifluous
Nestor
,
yet
gone
his
righteous
ways
unheeded
by
the
cruel
*NL*
kings
...
``
Why
,
if
I
've
told
'em
once
,
I
've
told
'em
a
dozen
times
to
*NL*
get
in
a
side-line
of
light-weight
pants
for
gents
'
summer
wear
,
and
of
*NL*
course
here
they
go
and
let
a
cheap
kike
like
Rifkin
beat
them
to
it
and
*NL*
grab
the
trade
right
off
'em
,
and
then
Harry
said
--
you
know
how
Harry
*NL*
is
,
maybe
he
do
n't
mean
to
be
grouchy
,
but
he
's
such
a
sore-head
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
her
a
hand
to
rise
.
``
If
you
do
n't
MIND
.
I
think
a
fellow
is
*NL*
awful
if
a
lady
goes
on
a
walk
with
him
and
she
ca
n't
trust
him
and
he
*NL*
tries
to
flirt
with
her
and
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
you
're
highly
trustworthy
!
''
she
snapped
,
and
she
sprang
up
*NL*
without
his
aid
.
Then
,
smiling
excessively
,
``
Uh
--
do
n't
you
think
Carol
*NL*
sometimes
fails
to
appreciate
Dr.
Will
's
ability
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
habitually
asked
her
about
his
window-trimming
,
the
display
of
the
*NL*
new
shoes
,
the
best
music
for
the
entertainment
at
the
Eastern
Star
,
and
*NL*
-LRB-
though
he
was
recognized
as
a
professional
authority
on
what
the
town
*NL*
called
``
gents
'
furnishings
''
-RRB-
about
his
own
clothes
.
She
persuaded
him
*NL*
not
to
wear
the
small
bow
ties
which
made
him
look
like
an
elongated
*NL*
Sunday
School
scholar
.
Once
she
burst
out
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ray
,
I
could
shake
you
!
Do
you
know
you
're
too
apologetic
?
You
always
*NL*
appreciate
other
people
too
much
.
You
fuss
over
Carol
Kennicott
when
she
*NL*
has
some
crazy
theory
that
we
all
ought
to
turn
anarchists
or
live
on
*NL*
figs
and
nuts
or
something
.
And
you
listen
when
Harry
Haydock
tries
to
*NL*
show
off
and
talk
about
turnovers
and
credits
and
things
you
know
lots
*NL*
better
than
he
does
.
Look
folks
in
the
eye
!
Glare
at
'em
!
Talk
deep
!
*NL*
You
're
the
smartest
man
in
town
,
if
you
only
knew
it
.
You
ARE
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
could
not
believe
it
.
He
kept
coming
back
to
her
for
confirmation
.
He
*NL*
practised
glaring
and
talking
deep
,
but
he
circuitously
hinted
to
Vida
*NL*
that
when
he
had
tried
to
look
Harry
Haydock
in
the
eye
,
Harry
had
*NL*
inquired
,
``
What
's
the
matter
with
you
,
Raymie
?
Got
a
pain
?
''
But
*NL*
afterward
Harry
had
asked
about
Kantbeatum
socks
in
a
manner
which
,
Ray
*NL*
felt
,
was
somehow
different
from
his
former
condescension
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
sitting
on
the
squat
yellow
satin
settee
in
the
boarding-house
*NL*
parlor
.
As
Ray
reannounced
that
he
simply
would
n't
stand
it
many
more
*NL*
years
if
Harry
did
n't
give
him
a
partnership
,
his
gesticulating
hand
*NL*
touched
Vida
's
shoulders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
excuse
me
!
''
he
pleaded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
all
right
.
Well
,
I
think
I
must
be
running
up
to
my
room
.
*NL*
Headache
,
''
she
said
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
and
she
had
stopped
in
at
Dyer
's
for
a
hot
chocolate
on
their
way
*NL*
home
from
the
movies
,
that
March
evening
.
Vida
speculated
,
``
Do
you
know
*NL*
that
I
may
not
be
here
next
year
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
her
fragile
narrow
nails
she
smoothed
the
glass
slab
which
formed
*NL*
the
top
of
the
round
table
at
which
they
sat
.
She
peeped
through
the
*NL*
glass
at
the
perfume-boxes
of
black
and
gold
and
citron
in
the
hollow
*NL*
table
.
She
looked
about
at
shelves
of
red
rubber
water-bottles
,
pale
*NL*
yellow
sponges
,
wash-rags
with
blue
borders
,
hair-brushes
of
polished
*NL*
cherry
backs
.
She
shook
her
head
like
a
nervous
medium
coming
out
of
a
*NL*
trance
,
stared
at
him
unhappily
,
demanded
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
I
stay
here
?
And
I
must
make
up
my
mind
.
Now
.
Time
to
renew
*NL*
our
teaching-contracts
for
next
year
.
I
think
I
'll
go
teach
in
some
*NL*
other
town
.
Everybody
here
is
tired
of
me
.
I
might
as
well
go
.
Before
*NL*
folks
come
out
and
SAY
they
're
tired
of
me
.
I
have
to
decide
tonight
.
I
*NL*
might
as
well
--
Oh
,
no
matter
.
Come
.
Let
's
skip
.
It
's
late
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
sprang
up
,
ignoring
his
wail
of
``
Vida
!
Wait
!
Sit
down
!
Gosh
!
I
'm
*NL*
flabbergasted
!
Gee
!
Vida
!
''
She
marched
out
.
While
he
was
paying
his
*NL*
check
she
got
ahead
.
He
ran
after
her
,
blubbering
,
``
Vida
!
Wait
!
''
In
the
*NL*
shade
of
the
lilacs
in
front
of
the
Gougerling
house
he
came
up
with
*NL*
her
,
stayed
her
flight
by
a
hand
on
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
n't
!
Do
n't
!
What
does
it
matter
?
''
she
begged
.
She
was
sobbing
,
*NL*
her
soft
wrinkly
lids
soaked
with
tears
.
``
Who
cares
for
my
affection
or
*NL*
help
?
I
might
as
well
drift
on
,
forgotten
.
O
Ray
,
please
do
n't
hold
*NL*
me
.
Let
me
go
.
I
'll
just
decide
not
to
renew
my
contract
here
,
and
--
and
*NL*
drift
--
way
off
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
hand
was
steady
on
her
shoulder
.
She
dropped
her
head
,
rubbed
the
*NL*
back
of
his
hand
with
her
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
married
in
June
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
took
the
Ole
Jenson
house
.
``
It
's
small
,
''
said
Vida
,
``
but
it
's
got
*NL*
the
dearest
vegetable
garden
,
and
I
love
having
time
to
get
near
to
*NL*
Nature
for
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Though
she
became
Vida
Wutherspoon
technically
,
and
though
she
certainly
*NL*
had
no
ideals
about
the
independence
of
keeping
her
name
,
she
continued
*NL*
to
be
known
as
Vida
Sherwin
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
resigned
from
the
school
,
but
she
kept
up
one
class
in
English
.
*NL*
She
bustled
about
on
every
committee
of
the
Thanatopsis
;
she
was
always
*NL*
popping
into
the
rest-room
to
make
Mrs.
Nodelquist
sweep
the
floor
;
*NL*
she
was
appointed
to
the
library-board
to
succeed
Carol
;
she
taught
the
*NL*
Senior
Girls
'
Class
in
the
Episcopal
Sunday
School
,
and
tried
to
revive
*NL*
the
King
's
Daughters
.
She
exploded
into
self-confidence
and
happiness
;
*NL*
her
draining
thoughts
were
by
marriage
turned
into
energy
.
She
became
*NL*
daily
and
visibly
more
plump
,
and
though
she
chattered
as
eagerly
,
she
*NL*
was
less
obviously
admiring
of
marital
bliss
,
less
sentimental
about
*NL*
babies
,
sharper
in
demanding
that
the
entire
town
share
her
reforms
--
the
*NL*
purchase
of
a
park
,
the
compulsory
cleaning
of
back-yards
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
penned
Harry
Haydock
at
his
desk
in
the
Bon
Ton
;
she
interrupted
*NL*
his
joking
;
she
told
him
that
it
was
Ray
who
had
built
up
the
*NL*
shoe-department
and
men
's
department
;
she
demanded
that
he
be
made
a
*NL*
partner
.
Before
Harry
could
answer
she
threatened
that
Ray
and
she
would
*NL*
start
a
rival
shop
.
``
I
'll
clerk
behind
the
counter
myself
,
and
a
Certain
*NL*
Party
is
all
ready
to
put
up
the
money
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
rather
wondered
who
the
Certain
Party
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Ray
was
made
a
one-sixth
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
became
a
glorified
floor-walker
,
greeting
the
men
with
new
poise
,
no
*NL*
longer
coyly
subservient
to
pretty
women
.
When
he
was
not
affectionately
*NL*
coercing
people
into
buying
things
they
did
not
need
,
he
stood
at
the
*NL*
back
of
the
store
,
glowing
,
abstracted
,
feeling
masculine
as
he
recalled
*NL*
the
tempestuous
surprises
of
love
revealed
by
Vida
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
remnant
of
Vida
's
identification
of
herself
with
Carol
was
a
*NL*
jealousy
when
she
saw
Kennicott
and
Ray
together
,
and
reflected
that
*NL*
some
people
might
suppose
that
Kennicott
was
his
superior
.
She
was
sure
*NL*
that
Carol
thought
so
,
and
she
wanted
to
shriek
,
``
You
need
n't
try
to
*NL*
gloat
!
I
would
n't
have
your
pokey
old
husband

He
has
n't
one
single
bit
*NL*
of
Ray
's
spiritual
nobility

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
THE
greatest
mystery
about
a
human
being
is
not
his
reaction
to
sex
or
*NL*
praise
,
but
the
manner
in
which
he
contrives
to
put
in
twenty-four
hours
*NL*
a
day
.
It
is
this
which
puzzles
the
long-shoreman
about
the
clerk
,
the
*NL*
Londoner
about
the
bushman
.
It
was
this
which
puzzled
Carol
in
regard
*NL*
to
the
married
Vida
.
Carol
herself
had
the
baby
,
a
larger
house
to
care
*NL*
for
,
all
the
telephone
calls
for
Kennicott
when
he
was
away
;
and
she
*NL*
read
everything
,
while
Vida
was
satisfied
with
newspaper
headlines
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
after
detached
brown
years
in
boarding-houses
,
Vida
was
hungry
for
*NL*
housework
,
for
the
most
pottering
detail
of
it
.
She
had
no
maid
,
nor
*NL*
wanted
one
.
She
cooked
,
baked
,
swept
,
washed
supper-cloths
,
with
*NL*
the
triumph
of
a
chemist
in
a
new
laboratory
.
To
her
the
hearth
was
*NL*
veritably
the
altar
.
When
she
went
shopping
she
hugged
the
cans
of
soup
,
*NL*
and
she
bought
a
mop
or
a
side
of
bacon
as
though
she
were
preparing
for
*NL*
a
reception
.
She
knelt
beside
a
bean
sprout
and
crooned
,
``
I
raised
this
*NL*
with
my
own
hands
--
I
brought
this
new
life
into
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
love
her
for
being
so
happy
,
''
Carol
brooded
.
``
I
ought
to
be
that
way
.
*NL*
I
worship
the
baby
,
but
the
housework
--
Oh
,
I
suppose
I
'm
fortunate
;
so
*NL*
much
better
off
than
farm-women
on
a
new
clearing
,
or
people
in
a
slum
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
has
not
yet
been
recorded
that
any
human
being
has
gained
a
very
*NL*
large
or
permanent
contentment
from
meditation
upon
the
fact
that
he
is
*NL*
better
off
than
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Carol
's
own
twenty-four
hours
a
day
she
got
up
,
dressed
the
baby
,
had
*NL*
breakfast
,
talked
to
Oscarina
about
the
day
's
shopping
,
put
the
baby
on
*NL*
the
porch
to
play
,
went
to
the
butcher
's
to
choose
between
steak
and
*NL*
pork
chops
,
bathed
the
baby
,
nailed
up
a
shelf
,
had
dinner
,
put
the
baby
*NL*
to
bed
for
a
nap
,
paid
the
iceman
,
read
for
an
hour
,
took
the
baby
out
*NL*
for
a
walk
,
called
on
Vida
,
had
supper
,
put
the
baby
to
bed
,
darned
*NL*
socks
,
listened
to
Kennicott
's
yawning
comment
on
what
a
fool
Dr.
*NL*
McGanum
was
to
try
to
use
that
cheap
X-ray
outfit
of
his
on
an
*NL*
epithelioma
,
repaired
a
frock
,
drowsily
heard
Kennicott
stoke
the
*NL*
furnace
,
tried
to
read
a
page
of
Thorstein
Veblen
--
and
the
day
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Except
when
Hugh
was
vigorously
naughty
,
or
whiney
,
or
laughing
,
*NL*
or
saying
``
I
like
my
chair
''
with
thrilling
maturity
,
she
was
always
*NL*
enfeebled
by
loneliness
.
She
no
longer
felt
superior
about
that
*NL*
misfortune
.
She
would
gladly
have
been
converted
to
Vida
's
satisfaction
*NL*
in
Gopher
Prairie
and
mopping
the
floor
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
drove
through
an
astonishing
number
of
books
from
the
public
*NL*
library
and
from
city
shops
.
Kennicott
was
at
first
uncomfortable
over
*NL*
her
disconcerting
habit
of
buying
them
.
A
book
was
a
book
,
and
if
you
*NL*
had
several
thousand
of
them
right
here
in
the
library
,
free
,
why
the
*NL*
dickens
should
you
spend
your
good
money
?
After
worrying
about
it
for
*NL*
two
or
three
years
,
he
decided
that
this
was
one
of
the
Funny
Ideas
*NL*
which
she
had
caught
as
a
librarian
and
from
which
she
would
never
*NL*
entirely
recover
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
authors
whom
she
read
were
most
of
them
frightfully
annoyed
by
the
*NL*
Vida
Sherwins
.
They
were
young
American
sociologists
,
young
English
*NL*
realists
,
Russian
horrorists
;
Anatole
France
,
Rolland
,
Nexo
,
Wells
,
*NL*
Shaw
,
Key
,
Edgar
Lee
Masters
,
Theodore
Dreiser
,
Sherwood
Anderson
,
Henry
*NL*
Mencken
,
and
all
the
other
subversive
philosophers
and
artists
whom
*NL*
women
were
consulting
everywhere
,
in
batik-curtained
studios
in
New
*NL*
York
,
in
Kansas
farmhouses
,
San
Francisco
drawing-rooms
,
Alabama
schools
*NL*
for
negroes
.
From
them
she
got
the
same
confused
desire
which
the
*NL*
million
other
women
felt
;
the
same
determination
to
be
class-conscious
*NL*
without
discovering
the
class
of
which
she
was
to
be
conscious
.
*NL*
*NL*
Certainly
her
reading
precipitated
her
observations
of
Main
Street
,
of
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
and
of
the
several
adjacent
Gopher
Prairies
which
she
had
*NL*
seen
on
drives
with
Kennicott
.
In
her
fluid
thought
certain
convictions
*NL*
appeared
,
jaggedly
,
a
fragment
of
an
impression
at
a
time
,
while
she
was
*NL*
going
to
sleep
,
or
manicuring
her
nails
,
or
waiting
for
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
convictions
she
presented
to
Vida
Sherwin
--
Vida
*NL*
Wutherspoon
--
beside
a
radiator
,
over
a
bowl
of
not
very
good
walnuts
and
*NL*
pecans
from
Uncle
Whittier
's
grocery
,
on
an
evening
when
both
Kennicott
*NL*
and
Raymie
had
gone
out
of
town
with
the
other
officers
of
the
Ancient
*NL*
and
Affiliated
Order
of
Spartans
,
to
inaugurate
a
new
chapter
at
*NL*
Wakamin
.
Vida
had
come
to
the
house
for
the
night
.
She
helped
in
putting
*NL*
Hugh
to
bed
,
sputtering
the
while
about
his
soft
skin
.
Then
they
talked
*NL*
till
midnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
Carol
said
that
evening
,
what
she
was
passionately
thinking
,
was
*NL*
also
emerging
in
the
minds
of
women
in
ten
thousand
Gopher
Prairies
.
Her
*NL*
formulations
were
not
pat
solutions
but
visions
of
a
tragic
futility
.
*NL*
She
did
not
utter
them
so
compactly
that
they
can
be
given
in
her
words
;
*NL*
they
were
roughened
with
``
Well
,
you
see
''
and
``
if
you
get
what
I
mean
''
*NL*
and
``
I
do
n't
know
that
I
'm
making
myself
clear
.
''
But
they
were
definite
*NL*
enough
,
and
indignant
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
In
reading
popular
stories
and
seeing
plays
,
asserted
Carol
,
she
*NL*
had
found
only
two
traditions
of
the
American
small
town
.
The
first
*NL*
tradition
,
repeated
in
scores
of
magazines
every
month
,
is
that
the
*NL*
American
village
remains
the
one
sure
abode
of
friendship
,
honesty
,
*NL*
and
clean
sweet
marriageable
girls
.
Therefore
all
men
who
succeed
in
*NL*
painting
in
Paris
or
in
finance
in
New
York
at
last
become
weary
of
*NL*
smart
women
,
return
to
their
native
towns
,
assert
that
cities
are
*NL*
vicious
,
marry
their
childhood
sweethearts
and
,
presumably
,
joyously
*NL*
abide
in
those
towns
until
death
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
other
tradition
is
that
the
significant
features
of
all
villages
are
*NL*
whiskers
,
iron
dogs
upon
lawns
,
gold
bricks
,
checkers
,
jars
of
gilded
*NL*
cat-tails
,
and
shrewd
comic
old
men
who
are
known
as
``
hicks
''
and
who
*NL*
ejaculate
``
Waal
I
swan
.
''
This
altogether
admirable
tradition
rules
*NL*
the
vaudeville
stage
,
facetious
illustrators
,
and
syndicated
newspaper
*NL*
humor
,
but
out
of
actual
life
it
passed
forty
years
ago
.
Carol
's
small
*NL*
town
thinks
not
in
hoss-swapping
but
in
cheap
motor
cars
,
*NL*
telephones
,
ready-made
clothes
,
silos
,
alfalfa
,
kodaks
,
phonographs
,
*NL*
leather-upholstered
Morris
chairs
,
bridge-prizes
,
oil-stocks
,
*NL*
motion-pictures
,
land-deals
,
unread
sets
of
Mark
Twain
,
and
a
chaste
*NL*
version
of
national
politics
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
small-town
life
a
Kennicott
or
a
Champ
Perry
is
content
,
but
*NL*
there
are
also
hundreds
of
thousands
,
particularly
women
and
young
men
,
*NL*
who
are
not
at
all
content
.
The
more
intelligent
young
people
-LRB-
and
the
*NL*
fortunate
widows
!
-RRB-
flee
to
the
cities
with
agility
and
,
despite
the
*NL*
fictional
tradition
,
resolutely
stay
there
,
seldom
returning
even
for
*NL*
holidays
.
The
most
protesting
patriots
of
the
towns
leave
them
in
old
*NL*
age
,
if
they
can
afford
it
,
and
go
to
live
in
California
or
in
the
*NL*
cities
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
reason
,
Carol
insisted
,
is
not
a
whiskered
rusticity
.
It
is
nothing
*NL*
so
amusing
!
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
an
unimaginatively
standardized
background
,
a
sluggishness
of
*NL*
speech
and
manners
,
a
rigid
ruling
of
the
spirit
by
the
desire
to
appear
*NL*
respectable
.
It
is
contentment
...
the
contentment
of
the
quiet
*NL*
dead
,
who
are
scornful
of
the
living
for
their
restless
walking
.
It
is
*NL*
negation
canonized
as
the
one
positive
virtue
.
It
is
the
prohibition
of
*NL*
happiness
.
It
is
slavery
self-sought
and
self-defended
.
It
is
dullness
*NL*
made
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
savorless
people
,
gulping
tasteless
food
,
and
sitting
afterward
,
*NL*
coatless
and
thoughtless
,
in
rocking-chairs
prickly
with
inane
*NL*
decorations
,
listening
to
mechanical
music
,
saying
mechanical
things
*NL*
about
the
excellence
of
Ford
automobiles
,
and
viewing
themselves
as
the
*NL*
greatest
race
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
inquired
as
to
the
effect
of
this
dominating
dullness
upon
*NL*
foreigners
.
She
remembered
the
feeble
exotic
quality
to
be
found
in
the
*NL*
first-generation
Scandinavians
;
she
recalled
the
Norwegian
Fair
at
the
*NL*
Lutheran
Church
,
to
which
Bea
had
taken
her
.
There
,
in
the
bondestue
,
*NL*
the
replica
of
a
Norse
farm
kitchen
,
pale
women
in
scarlet
jackets
*NL*
embroidered
with
gold
thread
and
colored
beads
,
in
black
skirts
with
a
*NL*
line
of
blue
,
green-striped
aprons
,
and
ridged
caps
very
pretty
to
set
*NL*
off
a
fresh
face
,
had
served
rommegrod
og
lefse
--
sweet
cakes
and
sour
*NL*
milk
pudding
spiced
with
cinnamon
.
For
the
first
time
in
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
Carol
had
found
novelty
.
She
had
reveled
in
the
mild
foreignness
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
saw
these
Scandinavian
women
zealously
exchanging
their
spiced
*NL*
puddings
and
red
jackets
for
fried
pork
chops
and
congealed
white
*NL*
blouses
,
trading
the
ancient
Christmas
hymns
of
the
fjords
for
``
She
's
My
*NL*
Jazzland
Cutie
,
''
being
Americanized
into
uniformity
,
and
in
less
than
*NL*
a
generation
losing
in
the
grayness
whatever
pleasant
new
customs
*NL*
they
might
have
added
to
the
life
of
the
town
.
Their
sons
finished
the
*NL*
process
.
In
ready-made
clothes
and
ready-made
high-school
phrases
they
*NL*
sank
into
propriety
,
and
the
sound
American
customs
had
absorbed
without
*NL*
one
trace
of
pollution
another
alien
invasion
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
along
with
these
foreigners
,
she
felt
herself
being
ironed
into
*NL*
glossy
mediocrity
,
and
she
rebelled
,
in
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
respectability
of
the
Gopher
Prairies
,
said
Carol
,
is
reinforced
by
*NL*
vows
of
poverty
and
chastity
in
the
matter
of
knowledge
.
Except
for
*NL*
half
a
dozen
in
each
town
the
citizens
are
proud
of
that
achievement
*NL*
of
ignorance
which
it
is
so
easy
to
come
by
.
To
be
``
intellectual
''
or
*NL*
``
artistic
''
or
,
in
their
own
word
,
to
be
``
highbrow
,
''
is
to
be
priggish
*NL*
and
of
dubious
virtue
.
*NL*
*NL*
Large
experiments
in
politics
and
in
co-operative
distribution
,
ventures
*NL*
requiring
knowledge
,
courage
,
and
imagination
,
do
originate
in
the
West
*NL*
and
Middlewest
,
but
they
are
not
of
the
towns
,
they
are
of
the
farmers
.
*NL*
If
these
heresies
are
supported
by
the
townsmen
it
is
only
by
occasional
*NL*
teachers
doctors
,
lawyers
,
the
labor
unions
,
and
workmen
like
Miles
*NL*
Bjornstam
,
who
are
punished
by
being
mocked
as
``
cranks
,
''
as
``
half-baked
*NL*
parlor
socialists
.
''
The
editor
and
the
rector
preach
at
them
.
The
cloud
*NL*
of
serene
ignorance
submerges
them
in
unhappiness
and
futility
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Vida
observed
,
``
Yes
--
well
--
Do
you
know
,
I
've
always
thought
*NL*
that
Ray
would
have
made
a
wonderful
rector
.
He
has
what
I
call
an
*NL*
essentially
religious
soul
.
My
!
He
'd
have
read
the
service
beautifully
!
*NL*
I
suppose
it
's
too
late
now
,
but
as
I
tell
him
,
he
can
also
serve
*NL*
the
world
by
selling
shoes
and
--
I
wonder
if
we
ought
n't
to
have
*NL*
family-prayers
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Doubtless
all
small
towns
,
in
all
countries
,
in
all
ages
,
Carol
*NL*
admitted
,
have
a
tendency
to
be
not
only
dull
but
mean
,
bitter
,
infested
*NL*
with
curiosity
.
In
France
or
Tibet
quite
as
much
as
in
Wyoming
or
*NL*
Indiana
these
timidities
are
inherent
in
isolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
a
village
in
a
country
which
is
taking
pains
to
become
altogether
*NL*
standardized
and
pure
,
which
aspires
to
succeed
Victorian
England
as
the
*NL*
chief
mediocrity
of
the
world
,
is
no
longer
merely
provincial
,
no
longer
*NL*
downy
and
restful
in
its
leaf-shadowed
ignorance
.
It
is
a
force
seeking
*NL*
to
dominate
the
earth
,
to
drain
the
hills
and
sea
of
color
,
to
set
Dante
*NL*
at
boosting
Gopher
Prairie
,
and
to
dress
the
high
gods
in
Klassy
Kollege
*NL*
Klothes
.
Sure
of
itself
,
it
bullies
other
civilizations
,
as
a
traveling
*NL*
salesman
in
a
brown
derby
conquers
the
wisdom
of
China
and
tacks
*NL*
advertisements
of
cigarettes
over
arches
for
centuries
dedicate
to
the
*NL*
sayings
of
Confucius
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
a
society
functions
admirably
in
the
large
production
of
cheap
*NL*
automobiles
,
dollar
watches
,
and
safety
razors
.
But
it
is
not
satisfied
*NL*
until
the
entire
world
also
admits
that
the
end
and
joyous
purpose
of
*NL*
living
is
to
ride
in
flivvers
,
to
make
advertising-pictures
of
dollar
*NL*
watches
,
and
in
the
twilight
to
sit
talking
not
of
love
and
courage
but
*NL*
of
the
convenience
of
safety
razors
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
such
a
society
,
such
a
nation
,
is
determined
by
the
Gopher
Prairies
.
*NL*
The
greatest
manufacturer
is
but
a
busier
Sam
Clark
,
and
all
the
rotund
*NL*
senators
and
presidents
are
village
lawyers
and
bankers
grown
nine
feet
*NL*
tall
.
*NL*
*NL*
Though
a
Gopher
Prairie
regards
itself
as
a
part
of
the
Great
World
,
*NL*
compares
itself
to
Rome
and
Vienna
,
it
will
not
acquire
the
scientific
*NL*
spirit
,
the
international
mind
,
which
would
make
it
great
.
It
picks
at
*NL*
information
which
will
visibly
procure
money
or
social
distinction
.
*NL*
Its
conception
of
a
community
ideal
is
not
the
grand
manner
,
the
noble
*NL*
aspiration
,
the
fine
aristocratic
pride
,
but
cheap
labor
for
the
kitchen
*NL*
and
rapid
increase
in
the
price
of
land
.
It
plays
at
cards
on
greasy
*NL*
oil-cloth
in
a
shanty
,
and
does
not
know
that
prophets
are
walking
and
*NL*
talking
on
the
terrace
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
all
the
provincials
were
as
kindly
as
Champ
Perry
and
Sam
Clark
there
*NL*
would
be
no
reason
for
desiring
the
town
to
seek
great
traditions
.
It
is
*NL*
the
Harry
Haydocks
,
the
Dave
Dyers
,
the
Jackson
Elders
,
small
busy
men
*NL*
crushingly
powerful
in
their
common
purpose
,
viewing
themselves
as
men
*NL*
of
the
world
but
keeping
themselves
men
of
the
cash-register
and
the
*NL*
comic
film
,
who
make
the
town
a
sterile
oligarchy
.

*NL*
*NL*
She
had
sought
to
be
definite
in
analyzing
the
surface
ugliness
of
*NL*
the
Gopher
Prairies
.
She
asserted
that
it
is
a
matter
of
universal
*NL*
similarity
;
of
flimsiness
of
construction
,
so
that
the
towns
resemble
*NL*
frontier
camps
;
of
neglect
of
natural
advantages
,
so
that
the
hills
*NL*
are
covered
with
brush
,
the
lakes
shut
off
by
railroads
,
and
the
*NL*
creeks
lined
with
dumping-grounds
;
of
depressing
sobriety
of
color
;
*NL*
rectangularity
of
buildings
;
and
excessive
breadth
and
straightness
of
*NL*
the
gashed
streets
,
so
that
there
is
no
escape
from
gales
and
from
sight
*NL*
of
the
grim
sweep
of
land
,
nor
any
windings
to
coax
the
loiterer
along
,
*NL*
while
the
breadth
which
would
be
majestic
in
an
avenue
of
palaces
makes
*NL*
the
low
shabby
shops
creeping
down
the
typical
Main
Street
the
more
mean
*NL*
by
comparison
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
universal
similarity
--
that
is
the
physical
expression
of
the
*NL*
philosophy
of
dull
safety
.
Nine-tenths
of
the
American
towns
are
so
*NL*
alike
that
it
is
the
completest
boredom
to
wander
from
one
to
another
.
*NL*
Always
,
west
of
Pittsburg
,
and
often
,
east
of
it
,
there
is
the
same
*NL*
lumber
yard
,
the
same
railroad
station
,
the
same
Ford
garage
,
the
same
*NL*
creamery
,
the
same
box-like
houses
and
two-story
shops
.
The
new
,
more
*NL*
conscious
houses
are
alike
in
their
very
attempts
at
diversity
:
the
same
*NL*
bungalows
,
the
same
square
houses
of
stucco
or
tapestry
brick
.
The
shops
*NL*
show
the
same
standardized
,
nationally
advertised
wares
;
the
newspapers
*NL*
of
sections
three
thousand
miles
apart
have
the
same
``
syndicated
*NL*
features
''
;
the
boy
in
Arkansas
displays
just
such
a
flamboyant
*NL*
ready-made
suit
as
is
found
on
just
such
a
boy
in
Delaware
,
both
of
them
*NL*
iterate
the
same
slang
phrases
from
the
same
sporting-pages
,
and
if
*NL*
one
of
them
is
in
college
and
the
other
is
a
barber
,
no
one
may
surmise
*NL*
which
is
which
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
Kennicott
were
snatched
from
Gopher
Prairie
and
instantly
conveyed
*NL*
to
a
town
leagues
away
,
he
would
not
realize
it
.
He
would
go
down
*NL*
apparently
the
same
Main
Street
-LRB-
almost
certainly
it
would
be
called
*NL*
Main
Street
-RRB-
;
in
the
same
drug
store
he
would
see
the
same
young
man
*NL*
serving
the
same
ice-cream
soda
to
the
same
young
woman
with
the
same
*NL*
magazines
and
phonograph
records
under
her
arm
.
Not
till
he
had
climbed
*NL*
to
his
office
and
found
another
sign
on
the
door
,
another
Dr.
Kennicott
*NL*
inside
,
would
he
understand
that
something
curious
had
presumably
*NL*
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Finally
,
behind
all
her
comments
,
Carol
saw
the
fact
that
the
prairie
*NL*
towns
no
more
exist
to
serve
the
farmers
who
are
their
reason
of
*NL*
existence
than
do
the
great
capitals
;
they
exist
to
fatten
on
the
*NL*
farmers
,
to
provide
for
the
townsmen
large
motors
and
social
preferment
;
*NL*
and
,
unlike
the
capitals
,
they
do
not
give
to
the
district
in
return
for
*NL*
usury
a
stately
and
permanent
center
,
but
only
this
ragged
camp
.
It
is
a
*NL*
``
parasitic
Greek
civilization
''
--
minus
the
civilization
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
we
are
then
,
''
said
Carol
.
``
The
remedy
?
Is
there
any
?
Criticism
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
for
the
beginning
of
the
beginning

Oh
,
there
's
nothing
that
*NL*
attacks
the
Tribal
God
Mediocrity
that
does
n't
help
a
little
...
and
*NL*
probably
there
's
nothing
that
helps
very
much

Perhaps
some
day
the
*NL*
farmers
will
build
and
own
their
market-towns

I
'm

Not
any

The
trouble
is
spiritual
,
and
no

can
enact
a

preference

's
my

confession

*NL*

Of
the
Thanatopsis
Club
she
spoke
;
of
the
rest-room
,
the
*NL*
fight
against
mosquitos
,
the
campaign
for
more
gardens
and
shade-trees
*NL*
and
sewers
--
matters
not
fantastic
and
nebulous
and
distant
,
but
*NL*
immediate
and
sure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
answer
was
fantastic
and
nebulous
enough
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

Yes

if
I

I

still
want
startling

exotic
things

Life
*NL*
is
comfortable

clean
enough
here
already
.
And
so
secure
.
What
it
*NL*
needs
is
to
be
less
secure

more
eager

The
civic
improvements
which
*NL*
I
'd
like
the
Thanatopsis
to
advocate
are
Strindberg
plays

classic
*NL*

exquisite

can
see
him

clearly

black-bearded

cynical

about

sing
opera

out

Vida
was
indignant

was
apologetic

they
talked
for
another
hour
,
*NL*
the
eternal
Mary
and
Martha
--
an
immoralist
Mary
and
a
reformist
Martha

*NL*
It
was
Vida
who
conquered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
fact
that
she
had
been
left
out
of
the
campaign
for
the
new
*NL*
schoolbuilding
disconcerted
Carol
.
She
laid
her
dreams
of
perfection
*NL*
aside
.
When
Vida
asked
her
to
take
charge
of
a
group
of
Camp
Fire
Girls
,
*NL*
she
obeyed
,
and
had
definite
pleasure
out
of
the
Indian
dances
and
*NL*
ritual
and
costumes
.
She
went
more
regularly
to
the
Thanatopsis
.
With
*NL*
Vida
as
lieutenant
and
unofficial
commander
she
campaigned
for
a
village
*NL*
nurse
to
attend
poor
families
,
raised
the
fund
herself
,
saw
to
it
that
*NL*
the
nurse
was
young
and
strong
and
amiable
and
intelligent
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
all
the
while
she
beheld
the
burly
cynical
Frenchman
and
the
*NL*
diaphanous
dancers
as
clearly
as
the
child
sees
its
air-born
playmates
;
*NL*
she
relished
the
Camp
Fire
Girls
not
because
,
in
Vida
's
words
,
``
this
*NL*
Scout
training
will
help
so
much
to
make
them
Good
Wives
,
''
but
because
*NL*
she
hoped
that
the
Sioux
dances
would
bring
subversive
color
into
their
*NL*
dinginess
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
helped
Ella
Stowbody
to
set
out
plants
in
the
tiny
triangular
park
*NL*
at
the
railroad
station
;
she
squatted
in
the
dirt
,
with
a
small
curved
*NL*
trowel
and
the
most
decorous
of
gardening
gauntlets
;
she
talked
to
Ella
*NL*
about
the
public-spiritedness
of
fuchsias
and
cannas
;
and
she
felt
*NL*
that
she
was
scrubbing
a
temple
deserted
by
the
gods
and
empty
even
of
*NL*
incense
and
the
sound
of
chanting
.
Passengers
looking
from
trains
saw
*NL*
her
as
a
village
woman
of
fading
prettiness
,
incorruptible
virtue
,
and
*NL*
no
abnormalities
;
the
baggageman
heard
her
say
,
``
Oh
yes
,
I
do
think
*NL*
it
will
be
a
good
example
for
the
children
''
;
and
all
the
while
she
saw
*NL*
herself
running
garlanded
through
the
streets
of
Babylon
.
*NL*
*NL*
Planting
led
her
to
botanizing
.
She
never
got
much
farther
than
*NL*
recognizing
the
tiger
lily
and
the
wild
rose
,
but
she
rediscovered
*NL*
Hugh
.
``
What
does
the
buttercup
say
,
mummy
?
''
he
cried
,
his
hand
full
of
*NL*
straggly
grasses
,
his
cheek
gilded
with
pollen
.
She
knelt
to
embrace
*NL*
him
;
she
affirmed
that
he
made
life
more
than
full
;
she
was
altogether
*NL*
reconciled
...
for
an
hour
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
awoke
at
night
to
hovering
death
.
She
crept
away
from
the
hump
*NL*
of
bedding
that
was
Kennicott
;
tiptoed
into
the
bathroom
and
,
by
the
*NL*
mirror
in
the
door
of
the
medicine-cabinet
,
examined
her
pallid
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
n't
she
growing
visibly
older
in
ratio
as
Vida
grew
plumper
and
*NL*
younger
?
Was
n't
her
nose
sharper
?
Was
n't
her
neck
granulated
?
She
*NL*
stared
and
choked
.
She
was
only
thirty
.
But
the
five
years
since
her
*NL*
marriage
--
had
they
not
gone
by
as
hastily
and
stupidly
as
though
she
had
*NL*
been
under
ether
;
would
time
not
slink
past
till
death
?
She
pounded
her
*NL*
fist
on

CHAPTER
XXIII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
WHEN
America
entered
the
Great
European
War
,
Vida
sent
Raymie
off
to
an
*NL*
officers
'
training-camp
--
less
than
a
year
after
her
wedding
.
Raymie
was
*NL*
diligent
and
rather
strong
.
He
came
out
a
first
lieutenant
of
infantry
,
*NL*
and
was
one
of
the
earliest
sent
abroad
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
grew
definitely
afraid
of
Vida
as
Vida
transferred
the
passion
*NL*
which
had
been
released
in
marriage
to
the
cause
of
the
war
;
as
she
*NL*
lost
all
tolerance
.
When
Carol
was
touched
by
the
desire
for
heroism
*NL*
in
Raymie
and
tried
tactfully
to
express
it
,
Vida
made
her
feel
like
an
*NL*
impertinent
child
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
enlistment
and
draft
,
the
sons
of
Lyman
Cass
,
Nat
Hicks
,
Sam
Clark
*NL*
joined
the
army
.
But
most
of
the
soldiers
were
the
sons
of
German
and
*NL*
Swedish
farmers
unknown
to
Carol
.
Dr.
Terry
Gould
and
Dr.
McGanum
became
*NL*
captains
in
the
medical
corps
,
and
were
stationed
at
camps
in
Iowa
and
*NL*
Georgia
.
They
were
the
only
officers
,
besides
Raymie
,
from
the
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
district
.
Kennicott
wanted
to
go
with
them
,
but
the
several
*NL*
doctors
of
the
town
forgot
medical
rivalry
and
,
meeting
in
council
,
*NL*
decided
that
he
would
do
better
to
wait
and
keep
the
town
well
till
he
*NL*
should
be
needed
.
Kennicott
was
forty-two
now
;
the
only
youngish
doctor
*NL*
left
in
a
radius
of
eighteen
miles
.
Old
Dr.
Westlake
,
who
loved
comfort
*NL*
like
a
cat
,
protestingly
rolled
out
at
night
for
country
calls
,
and
*NL*
hunted
through
his
collar-box
for
his
G.
A.
R.
button
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
not
quite
know
what
she
thought
about
Kennicott
's
going
.
*NL*
Certainly
she
was
no
Spartan
wife
.
She
knew
that
he
wanted
to
go
;
she
*NL*
knew
that
this
longing
was
always
in
him
,
behind
his
unchanged
*NL*
trudging
and
remarks
about
the
weather
.
She
felt
for
him
an
admiring
*NL*
affection
--
and
she
was
sorry
that
she
had
nothing
more
than
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cy
Bogart
was
the
spectacular
warrior
of
the
town
.
Cy
was
no
longer
the
*NL*
weedy
boy
who
had
sat
in
the
loft
speculating
about
Carol
's
egotism
and
*NL*
the
mysteries
of
generation
.
He
was
nineteen
now
,
tall
,
broad
,
busy
,
the
*NL*
``
town
sport
,
''
famous
for
his
ability
to
drink
beer
,
to
shake
dice
,
to
*NL*
tell
undesirable
stories
,
and
,
from
his
post
in
front
of
Dyer
's
drug
*NL*
store
,
to
embarrass
the
girls
by
``
jollying
''
them
as
they
passed
.
His
*NL*
face
was
at
once
peach-bloomed
and
pimply
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cy
was
to
be
heard
publishing
it
abroad
that
if
he
could
n't
get
the
*NL*
Widow
Bogart
's
permission
to
enlist
,
he
'd
run
away
and
enlist
without
*NL*
it
.
He
shouted
that
he
``
hated
every
dirty
Hun
;
by
gosh
,
if
he
could
just
*NL*
poke
a
bayonet
into
one
big
fat
Heinie
and
learn
him
some
decency
and
*NL*
democracy
,
he
'd
die
happy
.
''
Cy
got
much
reputation
by
whipping
a
farmboy
*NL*
named
Adolph
Pochbauer
for
being
a
``
damn
hyphenated
German
.
''
...
This
*NL*
was
the
younger
Pochbauer
,
who
was
killed
in
the
Argonne
,
while
he
was
*NL*
trying
to
bring
the
body
of
his
Yankee
captain
back
to
the
lines
.
At
*NL*
this
time
Cy
Bogart
was
still
dwelling
in
Gopher
Prairie
and
planning
to
*NL*
go
to
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Everywhere
Carol
heard
that
the
war
was
going
to
bring
a
basic
change
*NL*
in
psychology
,
to
purify
and
uplift
everything
from
marital
relations
to
*NL*
national
politics
,
and
she
tried
to
exult
in
it
.
Only
she
did
not
find
*NL*
it
.
She
saw
the
women
who
made
bandages
for
the
Red
Cross
giving
*NL*
up
bridge
,
and
laughing
at
having
to
do
without
sugar
,
but
over
the
*NL*
surgical-dressings
they
did
not
speak
of
God
and
the
souls
of
men
,
but
*NL*
of
Miles
Bjornstam
's
impudence
,
of
Terry
Gould
's
scandalous
carryings-on
*NL*
with
a
farmer
's
daughter
four
years
ago
,
of
cooking
cabbage
,
and
of
*NL*
altering
blouses
.
Their
references
to
the
war
touched
atrocities
only
.
*NL*
She
herself
was
punctual
,
and
efficient
at
making
dressings
,
but
she
*NL*
could
not
,
like
Mrs.
Lyman
Cass
and
Mrs.
Bogart
,
fill
the
dressings
with
*NL*
hate
for
enemies
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
protested
to
Vida
,
``
The
young
do
the
work
while
these
old
ones
*NL*
sit
around
and
interrupt
us
and
gag
with
hate
because
they
're
too
feeble
*NL*
to
do
anything
but
hate
,
''
then
Vida
turned
on
her
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
ca
n't
be
reverent
,
at
least
do
n't
be
so
pert
and
opinionated
,
*NL*
now
when
men
and
women
are
dying
.
Some
of
us
--
we
have
given
up
so
much
,
*NL*
and
we
're
glad
to
.
At
least
we
expect
that
you
others
sha
'n'
t
try
to
be
*NL*
witty
at
our
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
desire
to
see
the
Prussian
autocracy
defeated
;
she
did
*NL*
persuade
herself
that
there
were
no
autocracies
save
that
of
Prussia
;
*NL*
she
did
thrill
to
motion-pictures
of
troops
embarking
in
New
York
;
and
*NL*
she
was
uncomfortable
when
she
met
Miles
Bjornstam
on
the
street
and
he
*NL*
croaked
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
's
tricks
?
Things
going
fine
with
me
;
got
two
new
cows
.
Well
,
have
*NL*
you
become
a
patriot
?
Eh
?
Sure
,
they
'll
bring
democracy
--
the
democracy
*NL*
of
death
.
Yes
,
sure
,
in
every
war
since
the
Garden
of
Eden
the
workmen
*NL*
have
gone
out
to
fight
each
other
for
perfectly
good
reasons
--
handed
to
*NL*
them
by
their
bosses
.
Now
me
,
I
'm
wise
.
I
'm
so
wise
that
I
know
I
do
n't
*NL*
know
anything
about
the
war
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
a
thought
of
the
war
that
remained
with
her
after
Miles
's
*NL*
declamation
but
a
perception
that
she
and
Vida
and
all
of
the
*NL*
good-intentioners
who
wanted
to
``
do
something
for
the
common
people
''
*NL*
were
insignificant
,
because
the
``
common
people
''
were
able
to
do
things
*NL*
for
themselves
,
and
highly
likely
to
,
as
soon
as
they
learned
the
*NL*
fact
.
The
conception
of
millions
of
workmen
like
Miles
taking
control
*NL*
frightened
her
,
and
she
scuttled
rapidly
away
from
the
thought
of
a
time
*NL*
when
she
might
no
longer
retain
the
position
of
Lady
Bountiful
to
the
*NL*
Bjornstams
and
Beas
and
Oscarinas
whom
she
loved
--
and
patronized
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
in
June
,
two
months
after
America
's
entrance
into
the
war
,
that
*NL*
the
momentous
event
happened
--
the
visit
of
the
great
Percy
Bresnahan
,
*NL*
the
millionaire
president
of
the
Velvet
Motor
Car
Company
of
Boston
,
the
*NL*
one
native
son
who
was
always
to
be
mentioned
to
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
two
weeks
there
were
rumors
.
Sam
Clark
cried
to
Kennicott
,
``
Say
,
I
*NL*
hear
Perce
Bresnahan
is
coming
!
By
golly
it
'll
be
great
to
see
the
old
*NL*
scout
,
eh
?
''
Finally
the
Dauntless
printed
,
on
the
front
page
with
a
No.
1
*NL*
head
,
a
letter
from
Bresnahan
to
Jackson
Elder
:
*NL*
*NL*
DEAR
JACK
:
*NL*
*NL*
Well
,
Jack
,
I
find
I
can
make
it
.
I
'm
to
go
to
Washington
as
a
dollar
*NL*
a
year
man
for
the
government
,
in
the
aviation
motor
section
,
and
tell
*NL*
them
how
much
I
do
n't
know
about
carburetors
.
But
before
I
start
in
*NL*
being
a
hero
I
want
to
shoot
out
and
catch
me
a
big
black
bass
and
cuss
*NL*
out
you
and
Sam
Clark
and
Harry
Haydock
and
Will
Kennicott
and
the
rest
*NL*
of
you
pirates
.
I
'll
land
in
G.
P.
on
June
7
,
on
No.
7
from
Mpls
.
Shake
*NL*
a
day-day
.
Tell
Bert
Tybee
to
save
me
a
glass
of
beer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sincerely
yours

*NL*
*NL*
Perce

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
All
members
of
the
social
,
financial
,
scientific
,
literary
,
and
sporting
*NL*
sets
were
at
No.
7
to
meet
Bresnahan
;
Mrs.
Lyman
Cass
was
beside
Del
*NL*
Snafflin
the
barber
,
and
Juanita
Haydock
almost
cordial
to
Miss
Villets
*NL*
the
librarian
.
Carol
saw
Bresnahan
laughing
down
at
them
from
the
train
*NL*
vestibule
--
big
,
immaculate
,
overjawed
,
with
the
eye
of
an
executive
.
In
*NL*
the
voice
of
the
professional
Good
Fellow
he
bellowed
,
``
Howdy
,
folks
!
''
*NL*
As
she
was
introduced
to
him
-LRB-
not
he
to
her
-RRB-
Bresnahan
looked
into
her
*NL*
eyes
,
and
his
hand-shake
was
warm
,
unhurried
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
declined
the
offers
of
motors
;
he
walked
off
,
his
arm
about
the
*NL*
shoulder
of
Nat
Hicks
the
sporting
tailor
,
with
the
elegant
Harry
*NL*
Haydock
carrying
one
of
his
enormous
pale
leather
bags
,
Del
Snafflin
*NL*
the
other
,
Jack
Elder
bearing
an
overcoat
,
and
Julius
Flickerbaugh
*NL*
the
fishing-tackle
.
Carol
noted
that
though
Bresnahan
wore
spats
and
*NL*
a
stick
,
no
small
boy
jeered
.
She
decided
,
``
I
must
have
Will
get
a
*NL*
double-breasted
blue
coat
and
a
wing
collar
and
a
dotted
bow-tie
like
*NL*
his
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
evening
,
when
Kennicott
was
trimming
the
grass
along
the
walk
*NL*
with
sheep-shears
,
Bresnahan
rolled
up
,
alone
.
He
was
now
in
corduroy
*NL*
trousers
,
khaki
shirt
open
at
the
throat
,
a
white
boating
hat
,
and
*NL*
marvelous
canvas-and-leather
shoes
``
On
the
job
there
,
old
Will
!
Say
,
my
*NL*
Lord
,
this
is
living
,
to
come
back
and
get
into
a
regular
man-sized
pair
*NL*
of
pants
.
They
can
talk
all
they
want
to
about
the
city
,
but
my
idea
of
*NL*
a
good
time
is
to
loaf
around
and
see
you
boys
and
catch
a
gamey
bass
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
hustled
up
the
walk
and
blared
at
Carol
,
``
Where
's
that
little
fellow
?
*NL*
I
hear
you
've
got
one
fine
big
he-boy
that
you
're
holding
out
on
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
gone
to
bed
,
''
rather
briefly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
.
And
rules
are
rules
,
these
days
.
Kids
get
routed
through
the
*NL*
shop
like
a
motor

But
look
here
,
sister
;
I
'm
one
great
hand
at
busting
*NL*
rules
.
Come
on
now
,
let
Uncle
Perce
have
a
look
at
him
.
Please
now

*NL*
sister

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
put
his
arm
about
her
waist
;
it
was
a
large
,
strong
,
sophisticated
*NL*
arm
,
and
very
agreeable
;
he
grinned
at
her
with
a
devastating
*NL*
knowingness
,
while
Kennicott
glowed
inanely
.
She
flushed
;
she
was
*NL*
alarmed
by
the
ease
with
which
the
big-city
man
invaded
her
guarded
*NL*
personality
.
She
was
glad
,
in
retreat
,
to
scamper
ahead
of
the
two
men
*NL*
up-stairs
to
the
hall-room
in
which
Hugh
slept
.
All
the
way
Kennicott
*NL*
muttered
,
``
Well
,
well
,
say
,
gee
whittakers
but
it
's
good
to
have
you
*NL*
back
,
certainly
is
good
to
see
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hugh
lay
on
his
stomach
,
making
an
earnest
business
of
sleeping
.
He
*NL*
burrowed
his
eyes
in
the
dwarf
blue
pillow
to
escape
the
electric
light
,
*NL*
then
sat
up
abruptly
,
small
and
frail
in
his
woolly
nightdrawers
,
his
*NL*
floss
of
brown
hair
wild
,
the
pillow
clutched
to
his
breast
.
He
*NL*
wailed
.
He
stared
at
the
stranger
,
in
a
manner
of
patient
dismissal
.
*NL*
He
explained
confidentially
to
Carol
,
``
Daddy
would
n't
let
it
be
morning
*NL*
yet
.
What
does
the
pillow
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Bresnahan
dropped
his
arm
caressingly
on
Carol
's
shoulder
;
he
*NL*
pronounced
,
``
My
Lord
,
you
're
a
lucky
girl
to
have
a
fine
young
husk
like
*NL*
that
.
I
figure
Will
knew
what
he
was
doing
when
he
persuaded
you
to
take
*NL*
a
chance
on
an
old
bum
like
him
!
They
tell
me
you
come
from
St.
Paul
.
*NL*
We
're
going
to
get
you
to
come
to
Boston
some
day
.
''
He
leaned
over
*NL*
the
bed
.
``
Young
man
,
you
're
the
slickest
sight
I
've
seen
this
side
of
*NL*
Boston
.
With
your
permission
,
may
we
present
you
with
a
slight
token
of
*NL*
our
regard
and
appreciation
of
your
long
service
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
held
out
a
red
rubber
Pierrot
.
Hugh
remarked
,
``
Gim
me
it
,
''
hid
it
*NL*
under
the
bedclothes
,
and
stared
at
Bresnahan
as
though
he
had
never
*NL*
seen
the
man
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
once
Carol
permitted
herself
the
spiritual
luxury
of
not
asking
*NL*
``
Why
,
Hugh
dear
,
what
do
you
say
when
some
one
gives
you
a
present
?
''
*NL*
The
great
man
was
apparently
waiting
.
They
stood
in
inane
suspense
till
*NL*
Bresnahan
led
them
out
,
rumbling
,
``
How
about
planning
a
fishing-trip
,
*NL*
Will
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
remained
for
half
an
hour
.
Always
he
told
Carol
what
a
charming
*NL*
person
she
was
;
always
he
looked
at
her
knowingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
He
probably
would
make
a
woman
fall
in
love
with
him
.
But
it
*NL*
would
n't
last
a
week
.
I
'd
get
tired
of
his
confounded
buoyancy
.
*NL*
His
hypocrisy
.
He
's
a
spiritual
bully
.
He
makes
me
rude
to
him
in
*NL*
self-defense
.
Oh
yes
,
he
is
glad
to
be
here
.
He
does
like
us
.
He
's
so
*NL*
good
an
actor
that
he
convinces
his
own
self
...
I
'd
HATE
him
in
*NL*
Boston
.
He
'd
have
all
the
obvious
big-city
things
.
Limousines
.
*NL*
Discreet
evening-clothes
.
Order
a
clever
dinner
at
a
smart
restaurant
.
*NL*
Drawing-room
decorated
by
the
best
firm
--
but
the
pictures
giving
him
*NL*
away
.
I
'd
rather
talk
to
Guy
Pollock
in
his
dusty
office
...
How
I
*NL*
lie
!
His
arm
coaxed
my
shoulder
and
his
eyes
dared
me
not
to
admire
him
.
*NL*
I
'd
be
afraid
of
him
.
I
hate
him
!
...
Oh
,
the
inconceivable
egotistic
*NL*
imagination
of
women
!
All
this
stew
of
analysis
about
a
man
,
a
good
,
*NL*
decent
,
friendly
,
efficient
man
,
because
he
was
kind
to
me
,
as
Will
's
*NL*
wife

*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Kennicotts
,
the
Elders
,
the
Clarks
,
and
Bresnahan
went
fishing
*NL*
at
Red
Squaw
Lake
.
They
drove
forty
miles
to
the
lake
in
Elder
's
new
*NL*
Cadillac
.
There
was
much
laughter
and
bustle
at
the
start
,
much
storing
*NL*
of
lunch-baskets
and
jointed
poles
,
much
inquiry
as
to
whether
it
would
*NL*
really
bother
Carol
to
sit
with
her
feet
up
on
a
roll
of
shawls
.
*NL*
When
they
were
ready
to
go
Mrs.
Clark
lamented
,
``
Oh
,
Sam
,
I
forgot
*NL*
my
magazine
,
''
and
Bresnahan
bullied
,
``
Come
on
now
,
if
you
women
think
*NL*
you
're
going
to
be
literary
,
you
ca
n't
go
with
us
tough
guys
!
''
Every
*NL*
one
laughed
a
great
deal
,
and
as
they
drove
on
Mrs.
Clark
explained
that
*NL*
though
probably
she
would
not
have
read
it
,
still
,
she
might
have
wanted
*NL*
to
,
while
the
other
girls
had
a
nap
in
the
afternoon
,
and
she
was
right
*NL*
in
the
middle
of
a
serial
--
it
was
an
awfully
exciting
story
--
it
seems
*NL*
that
this
girl
was
a
Turkish
dancer
-LRB-
only
she
was
really
the
daughter
of
*NL*
an
American
lady
and
a
Russian
prince
-RRB-
and
men
kept
running
after
her
,
*NL*
just
disgustingly
,
but
she
remained
pure
,
and
there
was
a
scene
--
*NL*
*NL*
While
the
men
floated
on
the
lake
,
casting
for
black
bass
,
the
women
*NL*
prepared
lunch
and
yawned
.
Carol
was
a
little
resentful
of
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
the
men
assumed
that
they
did
not
care
to
fish
.
``
I
do
n't
want
to
*NL*
go
with
them
,
but
I
would
like
the
privilege
of
refusing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lunch
was
long
and
pleasant
.
It
was
a
background
for
the
talk
of
the
*NL*
great
man
come
home
,
hints
of
cities
and
large
imperative
affairs
and
*NL*
famous
people
,
jocosely
modest
admissions
that
,
yes
,
their
friend
Perce
*NL*
was
doing
about
as
well
as
most
of
these
``
Boston
swells
that
think
so
*NL*
much
of
themselves
because
they
come
from
rich
old
families
and
went
to
*NL*
college
and
everything
.
Believe
me
,
it
's
us
new
business
men
that
are
*NL*
running
Beantown
today
,
and
not
a
lot
of
fussy
old
bucks
snoozing
in
*NL*
their
clubs
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
realized
that
he
was
not
one
of
the
sons
of
Gopher
Prairie
who
,
*NL*
if
they
do
not
actually
starve
in
the
East
,
are
invariably
spoken
of
as
*NL*
``
highly
successful
''
;
and
she
found
behind
his
too
incessant
flattery
a
*NL*
genuine
affection
for
his
mates
.
It
was
in
the
matter
of
the
war
that
*NL*
he
most
favored
and
thrilled
them
.
Dropping
his
voice
while
they
bent
*NL*
nearer
-LRB-
there
was
no
one
within
two
miles
to
overhear
-RRB-
,
he
disclosed
*NL*
the
fact
that
in
both
Boston
and
Washington
he
'd
been
getting
a
lot
of
*NL*
inside
stuff
on
the
war
--
right
straight
from
headquarters
--
he
was
in
*NL*
touch
with
some
men
--
could
n't
name
them
but
they
were
darn
high
up
in
*NL*
both
the
War
and
State
Departments
--
and
he
would
say
--
only
for
Pete
's
*NL*
sake
they
must
n't
breathe
one
word
of
this
;
it
was
strictly
on
the
*NL*
Q.T.
and
not
generally
known
outside
of
Washington
--
but
just
between
*NL*
ourselves
--
and
they
could
take
this
for
gospel
--
Spain
had
finally
*NL*
decided
to
join
the
Entente
allies
in
the
Grand
Scrap
.
Yes
,
sir
,
there
'd
*NL*
be
two
million
fully
equipped
Spanish
soldiers
fighting
with
us
in
*NL*
France
in
one
month
now
.
Some
surprise
for
Germany
,
all
right
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
the
prospects
for
revolution
in
Germany
?
''
reverently
asked
*NL*
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
authority
grunted
,
``
Nothing
to
it
.
The
one
thing
you
can
bet
on
is
*NL*
that
no
matter
what
happens
to
the
German
people
,
win
or
lose
,
they
'll
*NL*
stick
by
the
Kaiser
till
hell
freezes
over
.
I
got
that
absolutely
*NL*
straight
,
from
a
fellow
who
's
on
the
inside
of
the
inside
in
Washington
.
*NL*
No
,
sir
!
I
do
n't
pretend
to
know
much
about
international
affairs
*NL*
but
one
thing
you
can
put
down
as
settled
is
that
Germany
will
be
a
*NL*
Hohenzollern
empire
for
the
next
forty
years
.
At
that
,
I
do
n't
know
as
*NL*
it
's
so
bad
.
The
Kaiser
and
the
Junkers
keep
a
firm
hand
on
a
lot
*NL*
of
these
red
agitators
who
'd
be
worse
than
a
king
if
they
could
get
*NL*
control
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
terribly
interested
in
this
uprising
that
overthrew
the
Czar
in
*NL*
Russia
,
''
suggested
Carol
.
She
had
finally
been
conquered
by
the
man
's
*NL*
wizard
knowledge
of
affairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
apologized
for
her
:
``
Carrie
's
nuts
about
this
Russian
*NL*
revolution
.
Is
there
much
to
it
,
Perce
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
not
!
''
Bresnahan
said
flatly
.
``
I
can
speak
by
the
book
there
.
*NL*
Carol
,
honey
,
I
'm
surprised
to
find
you
talking
like
a
New
York
Russian
*NL*
Jew
,
or
one
of
these
long-hairs
!
I
can
tell
you
,
only
you
do
n't
need
to
*NL*
let
every
one
in
on
it
,
this
is
confidential
,
I
got
it
from
a
man
who
's
*NL*
close
to
the
State
Department
,
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
Czar
will
*NL*
be
back
in
power
before
the
end
of
the
year
.
You
read
a
lot
about
his
*NL*
retiring
and
about
his
being
killed
,
but
I
know
he
's
got
a
big
army
back
*NL*
of
him
,
and
he
'll
show
these
damn
agitators
,
lazy
beggars
hunting
for
*NL*
a
soft
berth
bossing
the
poor
goats
that
fall
for
'em
,
he
'll
show
'em
*NL*
where
they
get
off
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
sorry
to
hear
that
the
Czar
was
coming
back
,
but
she
said
*NL*
nothing
.
The
others
had
looked
vacant
at
the
mention
of
a
country
so
far
*NL*
away
as
Russia
.
Now
they
edged
in
and
asked
Bresnahan
what
he
thought
*NL*
about
the
Packard
car
,
investments
in
Texas
oil-wells
,
the
comparative
*NL*
merits
of
young
men
born
in
Minnesota
and
in
Massachusetts
,
the
question
*NL*
of
prohibition
,
the
future
cost
of
motor
tires
,
and
was
n't
it
true
that
*NL*
American
aviators
put
it
all
over
these
Frenchmen
?
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
glad
to
find
that
he
agreed
with
them
on
every
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
heard
Bresnahan
announce
,
``
We
're
perfectly
willing
to
talk
to
*NL*
any
committee
the
men
may
choose
,
but
we
're
not
going
to
stand
for
some
*NL*
outside
agitator
butting
in
and
telling
us
how
we
're
going
to
run
our
*NL*
plant
!
''
Carol
remembered
that
Jackson
Elder
-LRB-
now
meekly
receiving
New
*NL*
Ideas
-RRB-
had
said
the
same
thing
in
the
same
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Sam
Clark
was
digging
up
from
his
memory
a
long
and
immensely
*NL*
detailed
story
of
the
crushing
things
he
had
said
to
a
Pullman
porter
,
*NL*
named
George
,
Bresnahan
hugged
his
knees
and
rocked
and
watched
Carol
.
*NL*
She
wondered
if
he
did
not
understand
the
laboriousness
of
the
smile
*NL*
with
which
she
listened
to
Kennicott
's
account
of
the
``
good
one
he
had
*NL*
on
Carrie
,
''
that
marital
,
coyly
improper
,
ten-times-told
tale
of
how
she
*NL*
had
forgotten
to
attend
to
Hugh
because
she
was
``
all
het
up
pounding
the
*NL*
box
''
--
which
may
be
translated
as
``
eagerly
playing
the
piano
.
''
She
was
*NL*
certain
that
Bresnahan
saw
through
her
when
she
pretended
not
to
hear
*NL*
Kennicott
's
invitation
to
join
a
game
of
cribbage
.
She
feared
the
*NL*
comments
he
might
make
;
she
was
irritated
by
her
fear
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
equally
irritated
,
when
the
motor
returned
through
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
,
to
find
that
she
was
proud
of
sharing
in
Bresnahan
's
kudos
*NL*
as
people
waved
,
and
Juanita
Haydock
leaned
from
a
window
.
She
said
to
*NL*
herself
,
``
As
though
I
cared
whether
I
'm
seen
with
this
fat
phonograph
!
''
*NL*
and
simultaneously
,
``
Everybody
has
noticed
how
much
Will
and
I
are
*NL*
playing
with
Mr.
Bresnahan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
town
was
full
of
his
stories
,
his
friendliness
,
his
memory
for
*NL*
names
,
his
clothes
,
his
trout-flies
,
his
generosity
.
He
had
given
*NL*
a
hundred
dollars
to
Father
Klubok
the
priest
,
and
a
hundred
to
the
*NL*
Reverend
Mr.
Zitterel
the
Baptist
minister
,
for
Americanization
work
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Bon
Ton
,
Carol
heard
Nat
Hicks
the
tailor
exulting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Old
Perce
certainly
pulled
a
good
one
on
this
fellow
Bjornstam
that
*NL*
always
is
shooting
off
his
mouth

He
's
supposed
to

settled
down
since
*NL*
he
got
married
,
but
Lord
,
those
fellows
that
think
they
know
it
all
,
*NL*
they
never
change
.
Well
,
the
Red
Swede
got
the
grand
razz
handed
to
him
,
*NL*
all
right
.
He
had
the
nerve
to
breeze
up
to
Perce
,
at
Dave
Dyer
's
,
and
*NL*
he
said
,
he
said
to
Perce
,
`
I
've
always
wanted
to
look
at
a
man
that
was
*NL*
so
useful
that
folks
would
pay
him
a
million
dollars
for
existing

and
*NL*
Perce
gave
him
the
once-over
and
come
right
back
,
`
Have
,
eh

'
he
says
.
*NL*
`
Well
,
'
he
says
,
`
I
've
been
looking
for
a
man
so
useful
sweeping
floors

that
I
could
pay
him
four
dollars
a
day

Want
the
job

my
friend

Ha
,
*NL*
ha
,
ha
!
Say
,
you
know
how
lippy
Bjornstam
is
?
Well
for
once
he
did
n't
*NL*
have
a
thing
to
say
.
He
tried
to
get
fresh
,
and
tell
what
a
rotten
*NL*
town
this
is
,
and
Perce
come
right
back
at
him
,
`
If
you
do
n't
like
this
*NL*
country
,
you
better
get
out
of
it
and
go
back
to
Germany
,
where
you
*NL*
belong

Say
,
maybe
us
fellows
did
n't
give
Bjornstam
the
horse-laugh
*NL*
though

Oh

Bresnahan
had
borrowed
Jackson
Elder
's
motor
;
he
stopped
at
the
*NL*
Kennicotts

;
he
bawled
at
Carol
,
rocking
with
Hugh
on
the
porch
,
``
Better

come

ride

wanted

``

Bresnahan
was
out
of
the
seat
,
*NL*
stalking
up
the
sidewalk
,
and
the
rest
of
her
protests
and
dignities
*NL*
were
feeble

*NL*
She
did
not
bring
Hugh
along

*NL*
*NL*
Bresnahan
was
silent
for
a
mile
,
in
words
,
But
he
looked
at
her
as
*NL*
though
he
meant
her
to
know
that
he
understood
everything
she
thought

*NL*
*NL*
She
observed
how
deep
was
his
chest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovely
fields
over
there

he
said

``
You

am

pretty
enough
so

``

his

chuckle
was
not
so
rotund

he
was
very
attentive
to
the
ammeter

In
a
moment
he
was
cautiously

Great
work
these

are
doing

The
other
*NL*
day
,
in
Washington
,
I
was
talking
to
a
big
scientific
shark
,
a
professor
*NL*
in
Johns
Hopkins
medical
school
,
and
he
was
saying
that
no
one
has
ever
*NL*
sufficiently
appreciated
the
general
practitioner
and
the
sympathy
*NL*
and
help
he
gives
folks
.
These
crack
specialists
,
the
young
scientific
*NL*
fellows
,
they
're
so
cocksure
and
so
wrapped
up
in
their
laboratories
*NL*
that
they
miss
the
human
element
.
Except
in
the
case
of
a
few
freak
*NL*
diseases
that
no
respectable
human
being
would
waste
his
time
having
,
*NL*
it
's
the
old
doc
that
keeps
a
community
well
,
mind
and
body
.
And
*NL*
strikes
me
that
Will
is
one
of
the
steadiest
and
clearest-headed
counter
*NL*
practitioners
I
've
ever
met

Eh

No

Let

a
fable

Imagine
a

cavewoman
complaining
to
her
mate

She
does
n't
like
one
single
thing
;
*NL*
she
hates
the
damp
cave
,
the
rats
running
over
her
bare
legs

the
stiff
*NL*
skin
garments
,
the
eating
of
half-raw
meat
,
her
husband
's
bushy
face
,
*NL*
the
constant
battles
,
and
the
worship
of
the
spirits
who
will
hoodoo
her
*NL*
unless
she
gives
the
priests
her
best
claw
necklace
.
Her
man
protests
,
*NL*
`
But
it
ca
n't
all
be
wrong

'
and
he
thinks
he
has
reduced
her
to
*NL*
absurdity
.
Now
you
assume
that
a
world
which
produces
a
Percy
Bresnahan
*NL*
and
a
Velvet
Motor
Company
must
be
civilized

It
is
?
Are
n't
we
only
*NL*
about
half-way
along
in
barbarism
?
I
suggest
Mrs.
Bogart
as
a
test
.
And
*NL*
we
'll
continue
in
barbarism
just
as
long
as
people
as
nearly
intelligent
*NL*
as
you
continue

defend

most
tried

against

he
was
so
much
the
successful

did
not
want
him
to
despise
her

His
manner
of

sneering
at
what
he
called
``
parlor
socialists

-LRB-
though
the
phrase
was
*NL*
not

new

had
a
power
which
made
her
wish
to
placate
his
*NL*
company
of
well-fed
,
speed-loving
administrators
.
When
he
demanded
,
*NL*
``
Would

wail

did
not

departed

eyes
remained

His
glances
at
her
lips

hair
and
shoulders
had
*NL*
revealed
to
her
that
she
was
not
a
wife-and-mother

a
girl
;
*NL*
that
there
still
were
men
in

world

as
there
had
been
in
college

days

admiration
led

to
study

tear
at

strangeness

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
ALL
that
midsummer
month
Carol
was
sensitive
to
Kennicott
.
She
recalled
*NL*
a
hundred
grotesqueries
:
her
comic
dismay
at
his
having
chewed
tobacco
,
*NL*
the
evening
when
she
had
tried
to
read
poetry
to
him
;
matters
which
had
*NL*
seemed
to
vanish
with
no
trace
or
sequence
.
Always
she
repeated
that
*NL*
he
had
been
heroically
patient
in
his
desire
to
join
the
army
.
She
made
*NL*
much
of
her
consoling
affection
for
him
in
little
things
.
She
liked
the
*NL*
homeliness
of
his
tinkering
about
the
house
;
his
strength
and
handiness
*NL*
as
he
tightened
the
hinges
of
a
shutter
;
his
boyishness
when
he
ran
*NL*
to
her
to
be
comforted
because
he
had
found
rust
in
the
barrel
of
his
*NL*
pump-gun
.
But
at
the
highest
he
was
to
her
another
Hugh
,
without
the
*NL*
glamor
of
Hugh
's
unknown
future
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
late
in
June
,
a
day
of
heat-lightning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Because
of
the
work
imposed
by
the
absence
of
the
other
doctors
the
*NL*
Kennicotts
had
not
moved
to
the
lake
cottage
but
remained
in
town
,
dusty
*NL*
and
irritable
.
In
the
afternoon
,
when
she
went
to
Oleson
&
McGuire
's
*NL*
-LRB-
formerly
Dahl
&
Oleson
's
-RRB-
,
Carol
was
vexed
by
the
assumption
of
*NL*
the
youthful
clerk
,
recently
come
from
the
farm
,
that
he
had
to
be
*NL*
neighborly
and
rude
.
He
was
no
more
brusquely
familiar
than
a
dozen
*NL*
other
clerks
of
the
town
,
but
her
nerves
were
heat-scorched
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
asked
for
codfish
,
for
supper
,
he
grunted
,
``
What
d'you
want
*NL*
that
darned
old
dry
stuff
for
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like
it
!

``
Punk

doc
can
afford
something
better
than
that

some

new
wienies

got
in

Swell
.

Haydocks

'em

She
exploded
.
``
My
dear
young
man
,
it
is
not
your
duty
to
instruct
me
in
*NL*
housekeeping
,
and
it
does

particularly
concern
me

the
Haydocks
*NL*
condescend
to
approve

*NL*
*NL*
He
was
hurt
.
He
hastily
wrapped
up
the
leprous
fragment
of
fish
;
he
*NL*
gaped
as
she
trailed
out
.
She
lamented
,
``
I
should
n't
have
spoken
so
.
He
*NL*
did
n't
mean
anything
.
He
does
n't
know
when
he
is
being
rude
.

*NL*
*NL*
Her
repentance
was
not
proof
against
Uncle
Whittier
when
she
stopped
in
*NL*
at
his
grocery
for
salt
and
a
package
of
safety
matches
.
Uncle
Whittier
,
*NL*
in
a
shirt
collarless
and
soaked
with
sweat
in
a
brown
streak
down
his
*NL*
back
,
was
whining
at
a
clerk
,
``

with
,
``
Do
n't
shoot
!
*NL*
I
surrender
!
''
She
smiled
,
but
it
occurred
to
her
that
for
nearly
five
*NL*
years
Dave
had
kept
up
this
game
of
pretending
that
she
threatened
his
*NL*
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
went
dragging
through
the
prickly-hot
street
she
reflected
that
a
*NL*
citizen
of
Gopher
Prairie
does
not
have
jests
--
he
has
a
jest
.
Every
*NL*
cold
morning
for
five
winters
Lyman
Cass
had
remarked
,
``
Fair
to
middlin
'
*NL*
chilly
--
get
worse
before
it
gets
better
.
''
Fifty
times
had
Ezra
Stowbody
*NL*
informed
the
public
that
Carol
had
once
asked
,
``
Shall
I
indorse
this
*NL*
check
on
the
back
?
''
Fifty
times
had
Sam
Clark
called
to
her
,
``
Where
'd
*NL*
you
steal
that
hat
?
''
Fifty
times
had
the
mention
of
Barney
Cahoon
,
*NL*
the
town
drayman
,
like
a
nickel
in
a
slot
produced
from
Kennicott
the
*NL*
apocryphal
story
of
Barney
's
directing
a
minister
,
``
Come
down
to
the
*NL*
depot
and
get
your
case
of
religious
books
--
they
're
leaking
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
home
by
the
unvarying
route
.
She
knew
every
house-front
,
every
*NL*
street-crossing
,
every
billboard
,
every
tree
,
every
dog
.
She
knew
every
*NL*
blackened
banana-skin
and
empty
cigarette-box
in
the
gutters
.
She
knew
*NL*
every
greeting
.
When
Jim
Howland
stopped
and
gaped
at
her
there
was
*NL*
no
possibility
that
he
was
about
to
confide
anything
but
his
grudging
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
haryuh
t
`
day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
her
future
life
,
this
same
red-labeled
bread-crate
in
front
of
the
*NL*
bakery
,
this
same
thimble-shaped
crack
in
the
sidewalk
a
quarter
of
a
*NL*
block
beyond
Stowbody
's
granite
hitching-post
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
silently
handed
her
purchases
to
the
silent
Oscarina
.
She
sat
on
the
*NL*
porch
,
rocking
,
fanning
,
twitchy
with
Hugh
's
whining
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
came
home
,
grumbled
,
``
What
the
devil
is
the
kid
yapping
*NL*
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
guess
you
can
stand
it
ten
minutes
if
I
can
stand
it
all
day
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
supper
in
his
shirt
sleeves
,
his
vest
partly
open
,
revealing
*NL*
discolored
suspenders
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
do
n't
you
put
on
your
nice
Palm
Beach
suit
,
and
take
off
that
*NL*
hideous
vest
?
''
she
complained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Too
much
trouble
.
Too
hot
to
go
up-stairs
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
realized
that
for
perhaps
a
year
she
had
not
definitely
looked
*NL*
at
her
husband
.
She
regarded
his
table-manners
.
He
violently
chased
*NL*
fragments
of
fish
about
his
plate
with
a
knife
and
licked
the
knife
*NL*
after
gobbling
them
.
She
was
slightly
sick
.
She
asserted
,
``
I
'm
*NL*
ridiculous
.
What
do
these
things
matter
!
Do
n't
be
so
simple
!
''
But
she
*NL*
knew
that
to
her
they
did
matter
,
these
solecisms
and
mixed
tenses
of
*NL*
the
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
realized
that
they
found
little
to
say
;
that
,
incredibly
,
they
were
*NL*
like
the
talked-out
couples
whom
she
had
pitied
at
restaurants
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bresnahan
would
have
spouted
in
a
lively
,
exciting
,
unreliable
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
realized
that
Kennicott
's
clothes
were
seldom
pressed
.
His
coat
was
*NL*
wrinkled
;
his
trousers
would
flap
at
the
knees
when
he
arose
.
His
shoes
*NL*
were
unblacked
,
and
they
were
of
an
elderly
shapelessness
.
He
refused
*NL*
to
wear
soft
hats
;
cleaved
to
a
hard
derby
,
as
a
symbol
of
virility
and
*NL*
prosperity
;
and
sometimes
he
forgot
to
take
it
off
in
the
house
.
She
*NL*
peeped
at
his
cuffs
.
They
were
frayed
in
prickles
of
starched
linen
.
*NL*
She
had
turned
them
once
;
she
clipped
them
every
week
;
but
when
she
had
*NL*
begged
him
to
throw
the
shirt
away
,
last
Sunday
morning
at
the
crisis
*NL*
of
the
weekly
bath
,
he
had
uneasily
protested
,
``
Oh
,
it
'll
wear
quite
a
*NL*
while
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
shaved
-LRB-
by
himself
or
more
socially
by
Del
Snafflin
-RRB-
only
three
*NL*
times
a
week
.
This
morning
had
not
been
one
of
the
three
times
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yet
he
was
vain
of
his
new
turn-down
collars
and
sleek
ties
;
he
often
*NL*
spoke
of
the
``
sloppy
dressing
''
of
Dr.
McGanum
;
and
he
laughed
at
old
men
*NL*
who
wore
detachable
cuffs
or
Gladstone
collars
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
not
care
much
for
the
creamed
codfish
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
noted
that
his
nails
were
jagged
and
ill-shaped
from
his
habit
of
*NL*
cutting
them
with
a
pocket-knife
and
despising
a
nail-file
as
effeminate
*NL*
and
urban
.
That
they
were
invariably
clean
,
that
his
were
the
scoured
*NL*
fingers
of
the
surgeon
,
made
his
stubborn
untidiness
the
more
jarring
.
*NL*
They
were
wise
hands
,
kind
hands
,
but
they
were
not
the
hands
of
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
remembered
him
in
the
days
of
courtship
.
He
had
tried
to
please
her
,
*NL*
then
,
had
touched
her
by
sheepishly
wearing
a
colored
band
on
his
straw
*NL*
hat
.
Was
it
possible
that
those
days
of
fumbling
for
each
other
were
*NL*
gone
so
completely
?
He
had
read
books
,
to
impress
her
;
had
said
-LRB-
she
*NL*
recalled
it
ironically
-RRB-
that
she
was
to
point
out
his
every
fault
;
had
*NL*
insisted
once
,
as
they
sat
in
the
secret
place
beneath
the
walls
of
Fort
*NL*
Snelling
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
shut
the
door
on
her
thoughts
.
That
was
sacred
ground
.
But
it
WAS
a
*NL*
shame
that
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
nervously
pushed
away
her
cake
and
stewed
apricots
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
supper
,
when
they
had
been
driven
in
from
the
porch
by
mosquitos
,
*NL*
when
Kennicott
had
for
the
two-hundredth
time
in
five
years
commented
,
*NL*
``
We
must
have
a
new
screen
on
the
porch
--
lets
all
the
bugs
in
,
''
they
sat
*NL*
reading
,
and
she
noted
,
and
detested
herself
for
noting
,
and
noted
again
*NL*
his
habitual
awkwardness
.
He
slumped
down
in
one
chair
,
his
legs
up
on
*NL*
another
,
and
he
explored
the
recesses
of
his
left
ear
with
the
end
of
*NL*
his
little
finger
--
she
could
hear
the
faint
smack
--
he
kept
it
up
--
he
*NL*
kept
it
up
--
*NL*
*NL*
He
blurted
,
``
Oh
.
Forgot
tell
you
.
Some
of
the
fellows
coming
in
to
play
*NL*
poker
this
evening
.
Suppose
we
could
have
some
crackers
and
cheese
and
*NL*
beer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
nodded
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
might
have
mentioned
it
before
.
Oh
well
,
it
's
his
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
poker-party
straggled
in
:
Sam
Clark
,
Jack
Elder
,
Dave
Dyer
,
Jim
*NL*
Howland
.
To
her
they
mechanically
said
,
''
`
Devenin
'
,
''
but
to
Kennicott
,
*NL*
in
a
heroic
male
manner
,
``
Well
,
well
,
shall
we
start
playing
?
Got
a
*NL*
hunch
I
'm
going
to
lick
somebody
real
bad
.
''
No
one
suggested
that
she
*NL*
join
them
.
She
told
herself
that
it
was
her
own
fault
,
because
she
was
*NL*
not
more
friendly
;
but
she
remembered
that
they
never
asked
Mrs.
Sam
*NL*
Clark
to
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bresnahan
would
have
asked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
in
the
living-room
,
glancing
across
the
hall
at
the
men
as
they
*NL*
humped
over
the
dining
table
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
shirt
sleeves
;
smoking
,
chewing
,
spitting
incessantly
;
*NL*
lowering
their
voices
for
a
moment
so
that
she
did
not
hear
what
they
*NL*
said
and
afterward
giggling
hoarsely
;
using
over
and
over
the
canonical
*NL*
phrases
:
``
Three
to
dole
,
''
``
I
raise
you
a
finif
,
''
``
Come
on
now
,
ante
up
;
*NL*
what
do
you
think
this
is
,
a
pink
tea
?
''
The
cigar-smoke
was
acrid
and
*NL*
pervasive
.
The
firmness
with
which
the
men
mouthed
their
cigars
made
the
*NL*
lower
part
of
their
faces
expressionless
,
heavy
,
unappealing
.
They
were
*NL*
like
politicians
cynically
dividing
appointments
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
they
understand
her
world
?
*NL*
*NL*
Did
that
faint
and
delicate
world
exist
?
Was
she
a
fool
?
She
doubted
her
*NL*
world
,
doubted
herself
,
and
was
sick
in
the
acid
,
smoke-stained
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
slipped
back
into
brooding
upon
the
habituality
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
was
as
fixed
in
routine
as
an
isolated
old
man
.
At
first
*NL*
he
had
amorously
deceived
himself
into
liking
her
experiments
with
*NL*
food
--
the
one
medium
in
which
she
could
express
imagination
--
but
now
*NL*
he
wanted
only
his
round
of
favorite
dishes
:
steak
,
roast
beef
,
boiled
*NL*
pig
's
-
feet
,
oatmeal
,
baked
apples
.
Because
at
some
more
flexible
period
*NL*
he
had
advanced
from
oranges
to
grape-fruit
he
considered
himself
an
*NL*
epicure
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
their
first
autumn
she
had
smiled
over
his
affection
for
his
*NL*
hunting-coat
,
but
now
that
the
leather
had
come
unstitched
in
dribbles
*NL*
of
pale
yellow
thread
,
and
tatters
of
canvas
,
smeared
with
dirt
of
the
*NL*
fields
and
grease
from
gun-cleaning
,
hung
in
a
border
of
rags
,
she
hated
*NL*
the
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Was
n't
her
whole
life
like
that
hunting-coat
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
every
nick
and
brown
spot
on
each
piece
of
the
set
of
china
*NL*
purchased
by
Kennicott
's
mother
in
1895
--
discreet
china
with
a
pattern
*NL*
of
washed-out
forget-me-nots
,
rimmed
with
blurred
gold
:
the
gravy-boat
,
*NL*
in
a
saucer
which
did
not
match
,
the
solemn
and
evangelical
covered
*NL*
vegetable-dishes
,
the
two
platters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twenty
times
had
Kennicott
sighed
over
the
fact
that
Bea
had
broken
the
*NL*
other
platter
--
the
medium-sized
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
kitchen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Damp
black
iron
sink
,
damp
whitey-yellow
drain-board
with
shreds
of
*NL*
discolored
wood
which
from
long
scrubbing
were
as
soft
as
cotton
thread
,
*NL*
warped
table
,
alarm
clock
,
stove
bravely
blackened
by
Oscarina
but
an
*NL*
abomination
in
its
loose
doors
and
broken
drafts
and
oven
that
never
*NL*
would
keep
an
even
heat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
done
her
best
by
the
kitchen
:
painted
it
white
,
put
up
*NL*
curtains
,
replaced
a
six-year-old
calendar
by
a
color
print
.
She
had
*NL*
hoped
for
tiling
,
and
a
kerosene
range
for
summer
cooking
,
but
Kennicott
*NL*
always
postponed
these
expenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
better
acquainted
with
the
utensils
in
the
kitchen
than
with
*NL*
Vida
Sherwin
or
Guy
Pollock
.
The
can-opener
,
whose
soft
gray
metal
*NL*
handle
was
twisted
from
some
ancient
effort
to
pry
open
a
window
,
*NL*
was
more
pertinent
to
her
than
all
the
cathedrals
in
Europe
;
and
*NL*
more
significant
than
the
future
of
Asia
was
the
never-settled
weekly
*NL*
question
as
to
whether
the
small
kitchen
knife
with
the
unpainted
handle
*NL*
or
the
second-best
buckhorn
carving-knife
was
better
for
cutting
up
cold
*NL*
chicken
for
Sunday
supper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
ignored
by
the
males
till
midnight
.
Her
husband
called
,
``
Suppose
*NL*
we
could
have
some
eats
,
Carrie
?
''
As
she
passed
through
the
dining-room
*NL*
the
men
smiled
on
her
,
belly-smiles
.
None
of
them
noticed
her
while
she
*NL*
was
serving
the
crackers
and
cheese
and
sardines
and
beer
.
They
were
*NL*
determining
the
exact
psychology
of
Dave
Dyer
in
standing
pat
,
two
hours
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
were
gone
she
said
to
Kennicott
,
``
Your
friends
have
the
*NL*
manners
of
a
barroom
.
They
expect
me
to
wait
on
them
like
a
servant
.
*NL*
They
're
not
so
much
interested
in
me
as
they
would
be
in
a
waiter
,
*NL*
because
they
do
n't
have
to
tip
me
.
Unfortunately
!
Well
,
good
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
rarely
did
she
nag
in
this
petty
,
hot-weather
fashion
that
he
was
*NL*
astonished
rather
than
angry
.
``
Hey
!
Wait
!
What
's
the
idea
?
I
must
say
*NL*
I
do
n't
get
you
.
The
boys
--
Barroom
?
Why
,
Perce
Bresnahan
was
saying
*NL*
there
is
n't
a
finer
bunch
of
royal
good
fellows
anywhere
than
just
the
*NL*
crowd
that
were
here
tonight
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stood
in
the
lower
hall
.
He
was
too
shocked
to
go
on
with
his
*NL*
duties
of
locking
the
front
door
and
winding
his
watch
and
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bresnahan
!
I
'm
sick
of
him
!
''
She
meant
nothing
in
particular
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Carrie
,
he
's
one
of
the
biggest
men
in
the
country

Boston
just
*NL*
eats
out
of
his
hand

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
if
it
does
?
How
do
we
know
but
that
in
Boston
,
among
well-bred
*NL*
people

he
may
be
regarded
as
an
absolute
lout
?
The
way
he
calls
women
*NL*
`
Sister

'
and
the
way

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
look
here

That
'll
do

Of
course
I
know
you
do

simply
hot

He
had
recovered
enough
to
lock
the

he
clumped
up-stairs
ahead
of
*NL*
her
,
growling
,
``
You

in

I
do
think
it
's
a
penalty
on
frugality

it
's
*NL*
an
unjust

darn-fool
tax

just
the

I
'll
pay
it

Only

I

not

idiot
enough
to
pay
more
than
the

makes
me
pay

Sam
and
*NL*
I
were
just
figuring
out
whether
all

exemptions

I
'll
take
a
lot
off
you

I
do
n't
propose
for
one
*NL*
second
to
stand
your
saying
I

not
patriotic

You
know
mighty
well
and
*NL*
good
that
I
've
tried
to
get
away
and
join
the
army

And
at
the
beginning
*NL*
of
the
whole
fracas
I
said
--
I
've
said
right
along

that
we
ought
to
have
*NL*
entered
the
war
the
minute
Germany
invaded
Belgium

You
do

get
me
at

all

You

appreciate
a

You

You

fussed
so
much

this
highbrow

junk

It
ended
,
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
,
in
his
calling
her
a
``
neurotic
''
*NL*
before
he
turned
away
and
pretended
to
sleep

It
clarified
in
her
the
longing
for
a
place
of
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
While
it
's
so
hot

I
think
I
'll
sleep

she
said
next
*NL*
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not

He
was
cheerful
and
kindly
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
room
was
filled
with
a
lumbering
double
bed
and
a
cheap
pine
bureau
.
*NL*
She
stored
the
bed
in
the
attic
;
replaced
it
by
a
cot
which
,
with
a
*NL*
denim
cover
,
made
a
couch
by
day
;
put
in
a
dressing-table
,
a
rocker
*NL*
transformed
by
a
cretonne
cover

had
Miles
Bjornstam
build
book-shelves

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
slowly
understood
that
she
meant
to
keep
up
her
seclusion
.
In
*NL*
his
queries
,
``
Changing
the
whole

?
''
``
Putting
your
books
in
there

''
*NL*
she
caught
his
dismay
.
But
it
was
so
easy
,
once
her
door
was
closed
,
to
*NL*
shut
out
his
worry

That
hurt
her
--
the
ease
of
forgetting
him

*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Bessie
Smail
sleuthed
out
this
anarchy

She
yammered
,
``

silly

up

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
spoke
of
recipes
for
corn-pudding
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
from
Mrs.
Dr.
Westlake
she
drew
encouragement
.
She
had
made
an
*NL*
afternoon
call
on
Mrs.
Westlake
.
She
was
for
the
first
time
invited
*NL*
up-stairs
,
and
found
the
suave
old
woman
sewing
in
a
white
and
mahogany
*NL*
room
with
a
small
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
do
you
have
your
own
royal
apartments

and
the
doctor
his

Carol
*NL*
hinted
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
do

The
doctor
says
it

stand
my

Mrs.
Westlake
looked
at
her
sharply
.
``
Why

do
n't
you
*NL*
do
the
same
thing
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
been
thinking
about
it

Carol
laughed
in
an
embarrassed
way
.
*NL*
``
Then
you
would
n't
regard
me
as
a
complete
hussy

I
wanted

be
by

myself

then

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

turn
over

thoughts

and
how
bad
her
complexion
is

and
*NL*
the

do

really
understand
her
,
and
how
much
work
she
finds
to

it
takes

endure
some

a

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
''
Carol
said
it
in
a
gasp
,
her
hands
twisted
together
.
She
wanted
*NL*
to
confess
not
only
her
hatred
for
the
Aunt
Bessies
but
her
covert
*NL*
irritation
toward
those
she
best
loved
:
her
alienation
from
Kennicott
,
*NL*
her
disappointment
in
Guy
Pollock
,
her
uneasiness
in
the
presence
of
*NL*
Vida
.
She
had
enough
self-control
to
confine
herself
to
,
``
Yes

Men
!
The
*NL*
dear
blundering
souls

do
have

get
off

*NL*
``
Of

so
much

He
does
not

He
chuckles
and
says

do
say
that

people

to
resemble

Drat

Mrs.
Westlake
laughed
*NL*
comfortably
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
such
a
disclosure
what
could
Carol
do
but
return
the
courtesy
by
*NL*
remarking
that
as
for
Kennicott
,
he
was
n't
romantic
enough
--
the
darling
.
*NL*
Before
she
left
she
had
babbled
to
Mrs.
Westlake
her
dislike
for
Aunt
*NL*
Bessie
,
the
fact
that
Kennicott
's
income
was
now
more
than
five
thousand
*NL*
a
year
,
her
view
of
the
reason
why
Vida
had
married
Raymie
-LRB-
which
*NL*
included
some
thoroughly
insincere
praise
of
Raymie
's
``
kind
heart
''
-RRB-
,
her
*NL*
opinion
of
the
library-board
,
just
what
Kennicott
had
said
about
Mrs.
*NL*
Carthal
's
diabetes
,
and
what
Kennicott
thought
of
the
several
surgeons
*NL*
in
the
Cities
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
home
soothed
by
confession

inspirited
by
finding
a
new

The
tragicomedy
of
the
``
domestic
situation

''
*NL*
*NL*
Oscarina
went
back
home
to
help
on
the
farm
,
and
Carol
had
a
succession
*NL*
of
maids
,
with
gaps
between
.
The
lack
of
servants
was
becoming
one
*NL*
of
the
most
cramping
problems
of
the
prairie
town
.
Increasingly
the
*NL*
farmers
'
daughters
rebelled
against
village
dullness
,
and
against
the
*NL*
unchanged
attitude
of
the
Juanitas
toward
``
hired
girls
.
''
They
went
off
*NL*
to
city
kitchens
,
or
to
city
shops
and
factories
,
that
they
might
be
*NL*
free
and
even
human
after
hours
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jolly
Seventeen
were
delighted
at
Carol
's
desertion
by
the
loyal
*NL*
Oscarina
.
They
reminded
her
that
she
had
said
,
``
I
do
n't
have
any
trouble
*NL*
with
maids
;
see
how
Oscarina
stays
on
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Between
incumbencies
of
Finn
maids
from
the
North
Woods
,
Germans
from
*NL*
the
prairies
,
occasional
Swedes
and
Norwegians
and
Icelanders
,
Carol
did
*NL*
her
own
work
--
and
endured
Aunt
Bessie
's
skittering
in
to
tell
her
how
to
*NL*
dampen
a
broom
for
fluffy
dust
,
how
to
sugar
doughnuts
,
how
to
stuff
*NL*
a
goose
.
Carol
was
deft
,
and
won
shy
praise
from
Kennicott
,
but
as
her
*NL*
shoulder
blades
began
to
sting
,
she
wondered
how
many
millions
of
women
*NL*
had
lied
to
themselves
during
the
death-rimmed
years
through
which
they
*NL*
had
pretended
to
enjoy
the
puerile
methods
persisting
in
housework
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
doubted
the
convenience
and
,
as
a
natural
sequent
,
the
sanctity
of
*NL*
the
monogamous
and
separate
home
which
she
had
regarded
as
the
basis
of
*NL*
all
decent
life
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
considered
her
doubts
vicious
.
She
refused
to
remember
how
many
of
*NL*
the
women
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
nagged
their
husbands
and
were
nagged
*NL*
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
energetically
did
not
whine
to
Kennicott
.
But
her
eyes
ached
;
she
*NL*
was
not
the
girl
in
breeches
and
a
flannel
shirt
who
had
cooked
over
a
*NL*
camp-fire
in
the
Colorado
mountains
five
years
ago
.
Her
ambition
was
to
*NL*
get
to
bed
at
nine
;
her
strongest
emotion
was
resentment
over
rising
at
*NL*
half-past
six
to
care
for
Hugh
.
The
back
of
her
neck
ached
as
she
got
*NL*
out
of
bed
.
She
was
cynical
about
the
joys
of
a
simple
laborious
life
.
*NL*
She
understood
why
workmen
and
workmen
's
wives
are
not
grateful
to
their
*NL*
kind
employers
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
mid-morning
,
when
she
was
momentarily
free
from
the
ache
in
her
neck
*NL*
and
back
,
she
was
glad
of
the
reality
of
work
.
The
hours
were
living
*NL*
and
nimble
.
But
she
had
no
desire
to
read
the
eloquent
little
newspaper
*NL*
essays
in
praise
of
labor
which
are
daily
written
by
the
white-browed
*NL*
journalistic
prophets
.
She
felt
independent
and
-LRB-
though
she
hid
it
-RRB-
a
*NL*
bit
surly
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
cleaning
the
house
she
pondered
upon
the
maid
's
-
room
.
It
was
a
*NL*
slant-roofed
,
small-windowed
hole
above
the
kitchen
,
oppressive
in
*NL*
summer
,
frigid
in
winter
.
She
saw
that
while
she
had
been
considering
*NL*
herself
an
unusually
good
mistress
,
she
had
been
permitting
her
friends
*NL*
Bea
and
Oscarina
to
live
in
a
sty
.
She
complained
to
Kennicott
.
``
What
's
*NL*
the
matter
with
it
?
''
he
growled
,
as
they
stood
on
the
perilous
stairs
*NL*
dodging
up
from
the
kitchen
.
She
commented
upon
the
sloping
roof
of
*NL*
unplastered
boards
stained
in
brown
rings
by
the
rain
,
the
uneven
floor
,
*NL*
the
cot
and
its
tumbled
discouraged-looking
quilts
,
the
broken
rocker
,
*NL*
the
distorting
mirror
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
it
ai
n't
any
Hotel
Radisson
parlor
,
but
still
,
it
's
so
much
*NL*
better
than
anything
these
hired
girls
are
accustomed
to
at
home
that
*NL*
they
think
it
's
fine
.
Seems
foolish
to
spend
money
when
they
would
n't
*NL*
appreciate
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
night
he
drawled
,
with
the
casualness
of
a
man
who
wishes
to
be
*NL*
surprising
and
delightful
,
``
Carrie
,
do
n't
know
but
what
we
might
begin
*NL*
to
think
about
building
a
new
house
,
one
of
these
days
.
How
'd
you
like
*NL*
that
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
W-why
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
getting
to
the
point
now
where
I
feel
we
can
afford
one
--
and
a
*NL*
corker
!
I
'll
show
this
burg
something
like
a
real
house
!
We
'll
put
one
*NL*
over
on
Sam
and
Harry
!
Make
folks
sit
up
an

take
notice
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
go
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
Daily
he
returned
to
the
subject
of
the
new
house
,
but
as
to
time
and
*NL*
mode
he
was
indefinite
.
At
first
she
believed
.
She
babbled
of
a
low
*NL*
stone
house
with
lattice
windows
and
tulip-beds
,
of
colonial
brick
,
of
*NL*
a
white
frame
cottage
with
green
shutters
and
dormer
windows
.
To
her
*NL*
enthusiasms
he
answered
,
``
Well
,
ye-es
,
might
be
worth
thinking
about
.
*NL*
Remember
where
I
put
my
pipe
?
''
When
she
pressed
him
he
fidgeted
,
``
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
;
seems
to
me
those
kind
of
houses
you
speak
of
have
been
*NL*
overdone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
proved
that
what
he
wanted
was
a
house
exactly
like
Sam
Clark
's
,
*NL*
which
was
exactly
like
every
third
new
house
in
every
town
in
the
*NL*
country
:
a
square
,
yellow
stolidity
with
immaculate
clapboards
,
a
broad
*NL*
screened
porch
,
tidy
grass-plots
,
and
concrete
walks
;
a
house
resembling
*NL*
the
mind
of
a
merchant
who
votes
the
party
ticket
straight
and
goes
to
*NL*
church
once
a
month
and
owns
a
good
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
admitted
,
``
Well
,
yes
,
maybe
it
is
n't
so
darn
artistic
but
--
Matter
*NL*
of
fact
,
though
,
I
do
n't
want
a
place
just
like
Sam
's
.
Maybe
I
would
cut
*NL*
off
that
fool
tower
he
's
got
,
and
I
think
probably
it
would
look
better
*NL*
painted
a
nice
cream
color
.
That
yellow
on
Sam
's
house
is
too
kind
*NL*
of
flashy
.
Then
there
's
another
kind
of
house
that
's
mighty
nice
and
*NL*
substantial-looking
,
with
shingles
,
in
a
nice
brown
stain
,
instead
of
*NL*
clapboards
--
seen
some
in
Minneapolis
.
You
're
way
off
your
base
when
you
*NL*
say
I
only
like
one
kind
of
house

*NL*
Uncle
Whittier
and
Aunt
Bessie
came
in
one
evening
when
Carol
was
*NL*
sleepily
advocating
a
rose-garden
cottage
.

*NL*
``
You

Kennicott
appealed

more
attention

furnace

to
all
this
architecture
and
doodads

*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Bessie
worked
her
lips
as
though
they
were
an
elastic
band
.
``
Why
*NL*
of
course
!
I
know
how
it
is
with
young
folks
like
you
,
Carrie

you
want
*NL*
towers
and
bay-windows
and
pianos
and
heaven
knows
what
all
,
but
the
*NL*
thing
to
get
is
closets
and
a
good
furnace
and
a
handy
place
to
hang
out
*NL*
the
washing
,
and
the
rest
do
n't

*NL*
Uncle
Whittier
dribbled
a
little
,
put
his
face
near
to
Carol
's
,
and
*NL*
sputtered
,
``
Course
it
do
n't

What
d'you
care
what
folks
think
about
*NL*
the
outside
of
your
house

It
's
the
inside
you
're
living
in
.
None
of
my
*NL*
business
,
but
I
must
say
you
young
folks
that
'd
rather
have
cakes
than
*NL*
potatoes
get
me
riled

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
reached
her
room
before
she
became
savage
.
Below
,
dreadfully
*NL*
near
,
she
could
hear
the
broom-swish
of
Aunt
Bessie
's
voice
,
and
the
*NL*
mop-pounding
of
Uncle
Whittier
's
grumble
.
She
had
a
reasonless
dread
*NL*
that
they
would
intrude
on
her
,
then
a
fear
that
she
would
yield
*NL*
to
Gopher
Prairie
's
conception
of
duty
toward
an
Aunt
Bessie
and
go
*NL*
down-stairs
to
be
``
nice
.
''
She
felt
the
demand
for
standardized
behavior
*NL*
coming
in
waves
from
all
the
citizens
who
sat
in
their
sitting-rooms
*NL*
watching
her
with
respectable
eyes
,
waiting
,
demanding
,
unyielding
.
She
*NL*
snarled
,
``
Oh
,
all
right
,
I
'll
go
!
''
She
powdered
her
nose
,
straightened
*NL*
her
collar
,
and
coldly
marched
down-stairs
.
The
three
elders
ignored
*NL*
her
.
They
had
advanced
from
the
new
house
to
agreeable
general
fussing
.
*NL*
Aunt
Bessie
was
saying
,
in
a
tone
like
the
munching
of
dry
toast
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
think
Mr.
Stowbody
ought
to
have
had
the
rain-pipe
fixed
at
our
*NL*
store
right
away

I
went
to
see
him
on
Tuesday
morning
before
ten

no
,
*NL*
it
was
couple
minutes
after
ten
,
but
anyway
,
it
was
long
before
noon

I
*NL*
know
because
I
went
right
from
the
bank
to
the
meat
market
to
get
some
*NL*
steak

my
!
I
think
it
's
outrageous
,
the
prices
Oleson
&
McGuire
charge
*NL*
for
their
meat
,
and
it
is
n't
as
if
they
gave
you
a
good
cut
either
but
*NL*
just
any
old
thing
,
and
I
had
time
to
get
it
,
and
I
stopped
in
at
Mrs.
*NL*
Bogart
's
to
ask
about
her
rheumatism
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
watching
Uncle
Whittier
.
She
knew
from
his
taut
expression
*NL*
that
he
was
not
listening
to
Aunt
Bessie
but
herding
his
own
thoughts
,
*NL*
and
that
he
would
interrupt
her
bluntly
.
He
did
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
,
where
c
'n
I
get
an
extra
pair
of
pants
for
this
coat
and
vest

*NL*
want
to
pay
too
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
guess
Nat
Hicks
could
make
you
up
a
pair

But
if
I
were
you
,
I
'd
*NL*
drop
into
Ike
Rifkin
's
--
his
prices
are
lower
than
the
Bon
Ton

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph

Got
the
new
stove
in
your
office
yet

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

looking
at
some
at
Sam
Clark

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

n't
do
to
put
off

all

summer
,
and
then
have
it
come
cold
on
you
in
the
fall

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
smiled
upon
them
ingratiatingly
.
``
Do
you
dears
mind
if
I
slip
up
*NL*
to
bed
?
I
'm
rather
tired
--
cleaned
the
upstairs
today
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
retreated
.
She
was
certain
that
they
were
discussing
her
,
and
foully
*NL*
forgiving
her
.
She
lay
awake
till
she
heard
the
distant
creak
of
a
bed
*NL*
which
indicated
that
Kennicott
had
retired
.
Then
she
felt
safe
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Kennicott
who
brought
up
the
matter
of
the
Smails
at
breakfast
.
*NL*
With
no
visible
connection
he
said
,
``
Uncle
Whit
is
kind
of
clumsy
,
but
*NL*
just
the
same
,
he
's
a
pretty
wise
old
coot
.
He
's
certainly
making
good
*NL*
with
the
store
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
smiled
,
and
Kennicott
was
pleased
that
she
had
come
to
her
senses
.
*NL*
``
As
Whit
says
,
after
all
the
first
thing
is
to
have
the
inside
of
a
*NL*
house
right
,
and
darn
the
people
on
the
outside
looking
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
seemed
settled
that
the
house
was
to
be
a
sound
example
of
the
Sam
*NL*
Clark
school
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
made
much
of
erecting
it
entirely
for
her
and
the
baby
.
He
*NL*
spoke
of
closets
for
her
frocks
,
and
``
a
comfy
sewing-room
.
''
But
when
*NL*
he
drew
on
a
leaf
from
an
old
account-book
-LRB-
he
was
a
paper-saver
and
a
*NL*
string-picker
-RRB-
the
plans
for
the
garage
,
he
gave
much
more
attention
*NL*
to
a
cement
floor
and
a
work-bench
and
a
gasoline-tank
than
he
had
to
*NL*
sewing-rooms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
back
and
was
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
present
rookery
there
were
odd
things
--
a
step
up
from
the
hall
*NL*
to
the
dining-room
,
a
picturesqueness
in
the
shed
and
bedraggled
lilac
*NL*
bush
.
But
the
new
place
would
be
smooth
,
standardized
,
fixed
.
It
was
*NL*
probable
,
now
that
Kennicott
was
past
forty
,
and
settled
,
that
this
*NL*
would
be
the
last
venture
he
would
ever
make
in
building
.
So
long
as
she
*NL*
stayed
in
this
ark
,
she
would
always
have
a
possibility
of
change
,
but
*NL*
once
she
was
in
the
new
house
,
there
she
would
sit
for
all
the
rest
of
*NL*
her
life
--
there
she
would
die
.
Desperately
she
wanted
to
put
it
off
,
*NL*
against
the
chance
of
miracles
.
While
Kennicott
was
chattering
about
a
*NL*
patent
swing-door
for
the
garage
she
saw
the
swing-doors
of
a
prison
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
never
voluntarily
returned
to
the
project
.
Aggrieved
,
Kennicott
*NL*
stopped
drawing
plans
,
and
in
ten
days
the
new
house
was
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Every
year
since
their
marriage
Carol
had
longed
for
a
trip
through
the
*NL*
East
.
Every
year
Kennicott
had
talked
of
attending
the
American
Medical
*NL*
Association
convention
,
``
and
then
afterwards
we
could
do
the
East
*NL*
up
brown
.
I
know
New
York
clean
through
--
spent
pretty
near
a
week
*NL*
there
--
but
I
would
like
to
see
New
England
and
all
these
historic
places
*NL*
and
have
some
sea-food
.
''
He
talked
of
it
from
February
to
May
,
and
in
*NL*
May
he
invariably
decided
that
coming
confinement-cases
or
land-deals
*NL*
would
prevent
his
``
getting
away
from
home-base
for
very
long
THIS
*NL*
year
--
and
no
sense
going
till
we
can
do
it
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
weariness
of
dish-washing
had
increased
her
desire
to
go
.
She
*NL*
pictured
herself
looking
at
Emerson
's
manse
,
bathing
in
a
surf
of
jade
*NL*
and
ivory
,
wearing
a
trottoir
and
a
summer
fur
,
meeting
an
aristocratic
*NL*
Stranger
.
In
the
spring
Kennicott
had
pathetically
volunteered
,
``
S'pose
*NL*
you
'd
like
to
get
in
a
good
long
tour
this
summer
,
but
with
Gould
and
*NL*
Mac
away
and
so
many
patients
depending
on
me
,
do
n't
see
how
I
can
make
*NL*
it
.
By
golly
,
I
feel
like
a
tightwad
though
,
not
taking
you
.
''
Through
*NL*
all
this
restless
July
after
she
had
tasted
Bresnahan
's
disturbing
*NL*
flavor
of
travel
and
gaiety
,
she
wanted
to
go
,
but
she
said
nothing
.
*NL*
They
spoke
of
and
postponed
a
trip
to
the
Twin
Cities
.
When
she
*NL*
suggested
,
as
though
it
were
a
tremendous
joke
,
``
I
think
baby
and
I
*NL*
might
up
and
leave
you
,
and
run
off
to
Cape
Cod
by
ourselves
!
''
his
only
*NL*
reaction
was
``
Golly
,
do
n't
know
but
what
you
may
almost
have
to
do
that
,
*NL*
if
we
do
n't
get
in
a
trip
next
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Toward
the
end
of
July
he
proposed
,
``
Say
,
the
Beavers
are
holding
a
*NL*
convention
in
Joralemon
,
street
fair
and
everything
.
We
might
go
down
*NL*
tomorrow
.
And
I
'd
like
to
see
Dr.
Calibree
about
some
business
.
Put
in
*NL*
the
whole
day

Might
help
some
to
make
up
for
our
trip

Fine
fellow

Dr.
*NL*
Calibree

''
*NL*
*NL*
Joralemon
was
a
prairie
town
of
the
size
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
motor
was
out
of
order
,
and
there
was
no
passenger-train
at
an
*NL*
early
hour
.
They
went
down
by
freight-train
,
after
the
weighty
and
*NL*
conversational
business
of
leaving
Hugh
with
Aunt
Bessie
.
Carol
was
*NL*
exultant
over
this
irregular
jaunting
.
It
was
the
first
unusual
thing
,
*NL*
except
the
glance
of
Bresnahan
,
that
had
happened
since
the
weaning
of
*NL*
Hugh
.
They
rode
in
the
caboose
,
the
small
red
cupola-topped
car
jerked
*NL*
along
at
the
end
of
the
train
.
It
was
a
roving
shanty
,
the
cabin
of
a
*NL*
land
schooner
,
with
black
oilcloth
seats
along
the
side
,
and
for
desk
,
a
*NL*
pine
board
to
be
let
down
on
hinges
.
Kennicott
played
seven-up
with
the
*NL*
conductor
and
two
brakemen
.
Carol
liked
the
blue
silk
kerchiefs
about
*NL*
the
brakemen
's
throats
;
she
liked
their
welcome
to
her
,
and
their
air
of
*NL*
friendly
independence
.
Since
there
were
no
sweating
passengers
crammed
*NL*
in
beside
her
,
she
reveled
in
the
train
's
slowness
.
She
was
part
of
*NL*
these
lakes
and
tawny
wheat-fields
.
She
liked
the
smell
of
hot
earth
and
*NL*
clean
grease
;
and
the
leisurely
chug-a-chug
,
chug-a-chug
of
the
trucks
*NL*
was
a
song
of
contentment
in
the
sun
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
pretended
that
she
was
going
to
the
Rockies
.
When
they
reached
*NL*
Joralemon
she
was
radiant
with
holiday-making
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eagerness
began
to
lessen
the
moment
they
stopped
at
a
red
frame
*NL*
station
exactly
like
the
one
they
had
just
left
at
Gopher
Prairie
,
*NL*
and
Kennicott
yawned
,
``
Right
on
time
.
Just
in
time
for
dinner
at
the
*NL*
Calibrees

.
I
`
phoned
the
doctor
from
G.
P.
that
we
'd
be
here
.
`
We
'll
*NL*
catch
the
freight
that

I
told
him

He
said

take
us
right
up

you
'll
find

little

bright
as

By

there
he
is

*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Calibree
was
a
squat
,
clean-shaven
,
conscientious-looking
man
of
*NL*
forty
.
He
was
curiously
like
his
own
brown-painted
motor
car
,
with
*NL*
eye-glasses
for
windshield
.
``
Want

meet
my
wife

quainted

said
Kennicott
.
Calibree
bowed
*NL*
quietly
and
shook
her
hand
,
but
before
he
had
finished
shaking
it
he
was
*NL*
concentrating
upon
Kennicott
with
,
``
Nice
to
see
you
,
doctor

Say
,
do
n't

me
forget
to
ask
you

you
did
in
that
exopthalmic
goiter
*NL*
case

that
Bohemian
woman
at
Wahkeenyan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
,
on
the
front
seat
of
the
car
,
chanted
goiters
and
ignored
*NL*
her
.
She
did
not
know
it
.
She
was
trying
to
feed
her
illusion
of
*NL*
adventure
by
staring
at
unfamiliar
houses
...
drab
cottages
,
artificial
*NL*
stone
bungalows
,
square
painty
stolidities
with
immaculate
clapboards
*NL*
and
broad
screened
porches
and
tidy
grass-plots
.
*NL*
*NL*
Calibree
handed
her
over
to
his
wife
,
a
thick
woman
who
called
*NL*
her
``
dearie
,
''
and
asked
if
she
was
hot
and
,
visibly
searching
for
*NL*
conversation
,
produced
,
``
Let
's
see
,
you
and
the
doctor
have
a
Little
*NL*
One
,
have
n't
you
?
''
At
dinner
Mrs.
Calibree
served
the
corned
beef
and
*NL*
cabbage
and
looked
steamy
,
looked
like
the
steamy
leaves
of
cabbage
.
The
*NL*
men
were
oblivious
of
their
wives
as
they
gave
the
social
passwords
of
*NL*
Main
Street
,
the
orthodox
opinions
on
weather
,
crops
,
and
motor
cars
,
*NL*
then
flung
away
restraint
and
gyrated
in
the
debauch
of
shop-talk
.
*NL*
Stroking
his
chin
,
drawling
in
the
ecstasy
of
being
erudite
,
Kennicott
*NL*
inquired
,
``
Say
,
doctor
,
what
success
have
you
had
with
thyroid
for
*NL*
treatment
of
pains
in
the
legs

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
did
not
resent
their
assumption
that
she
was
too
ignorant
to
be
*NL*
admitted
to
masculine
mysteries
.
She
was
used
to
it
.
But
the
cabbage
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Calibree
's
monotonous
``
I
do
n't
know
what
we
're
coming
to
with
*NL*
all
this
difficulty
getting
hired
girls
''
were
gumming
her
eyes
with
*NL*
drowsiness
.
She
sought
to
clear
them
by
appealing
to
Calibree
,
in
a
*NL*
manner
of
exaggerated
liveliness
,
``
Doctor
,
have
the
medical
societies
*NL*
in
Minnesota
ever

Calibree
slowly
revolved
toward
her

turned
squarely
from
her
and

peering
earnestly
at

resumed

*NL*
Not
till
after
two
did
they
rise
.
In
the
lee
of
the
stonily
mature
trio
*NL*
Carol
proceeded
to
the
street
fair
which
added
mundane
gaiety
to
the
*NL*
annual
rites
of
the
United
and
Fraternal
Order
of
Beavers
.
Beavers
,
*NL*
human
Beavers
,
were
everywhere
:
thirty-second
degree
Beavers
in
gray
*NL*
sack
suits
and
decent
derbies
,
more
flippant
Beavers
in
crash
summer
*NL*
coats
and
straw
hats
,
rustic
Beavers
in
shirt
sleeves
and
frayed
*NL*
suspenders
;
but
whatever
his
caste-symbols
,
every
Beaver
was
*NL*
distinguished
by
an
enormous
shrimp-colored
ribbon
lettered
in
silver
,
*NL*
``

''
On
the
*NL*
motherly
shirtwaist
of
each
of
their
wives
was
a
badge
``
Sir
Knight
's
*NL*
Lady
.
''
The
Duluth
delegation
had
brought
their
famous
Beaver
amateur
*NL*
band
,
in
Zouave
costumes
of
green
velvet
jacket
,
blue
trousers
,
and
*NL*
scarlet
fez
.
The
strange
thing
was
that
beneath
their
scarlet
pride
the
*NL*
Zouaves
'
faces
remained
those
of
American
business-men
,
pink
,
smooth
,
*NL*
eye-glassed
;
and
as
they
stood
playing
in
a
circle
,
at
the
corner
of
*NL*
Main
Street
and
Second
,
as
they
tootled
on
fifes
or
with
swelling
cheeks
*NL*
blew
into
cornets
,
their
eyes
remained
as
owlish
as
though
they
were
*NL*
sitting
at
desks
under
the
sign
``
This
Is
My
Busy
Day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
supposed
that
the
Beavers
were
average
citizens
organized
for
*NL*
the
purposes
of
getting
cheap
life-insurance
and
playing
poker
at
the
*NL*
lodge-rooms
every
second
Wednesday
,
but
she
saw
a
large
poster
which
*NL*
proclaimed
:
*NL*
*NL*
BEAVERS

U.
F.
O.
B

*NL*
*NL*
The
greatest
influence

in

country

open-handed

hustle-em-up

Joralemon
welcomes

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
read
the
poster
and
to
Calibree
admired
,
``

adumbrated

*NL*
*NL*
They
went
on
to
the
street
fair
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lining
one
block
of
Main
Street
were
the
``
attractions
''
--
two
hot-dog
*NL*
stands
,
a
lemonade
and
pop-corn
stand
,
a
merry-go-round
,
and
booths
in
*NL*
which
balls
might
be
thrown
at
rag
dolls
,
if
one
wished
to
throw
balls
*NL*
at
rag
dolls
.
The
dignified
delegates
were
shy
of
the
booths
,
but
*NL*
country
boys
with
brickred
necks
and
pale-blue
ties
and
bright-yellow
*NL*
shoes
,
who
had
brought
sweethearts
into
town
in
somewhat
dusty
and
*NL*
listed
Fords
,
were
wolfing
sandwiches
,
drinking
strawberry
pop
out
of
*NL*
bottles
,
and
riding
the
revolving
crimson
and
gold
horses
.
They
shrieked
*NL*
and
giggled
;
peanut-roasters
whistled
;
the
merry-go-round
pounded
out
*NL*
monotonous
music
;
the
barkers
bawled
,

*NL*
The
prairie
sun
jabbed
the
unshaded
street
with
shafts
that
were
like
*NL*
poisonous
thorns
the
tinny
cornices
above
the
brick
stores
were
glaring
;
*NL*
the
dull
breeze
scattered

on
sweaty
Beavers

crawled
along
in

tight
scorching
new
shoes

up
two
blocks
and
back
,
up
two
blocks

*NL*
back

wondering
what
to
do
next

working
at
having
a
good
time

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
head
ached
as
she
trailed
behind
the
unsmiling
Calibrees
along
*NL*
the
block
of
booths
.
She
chirruped
at
Kennicott
,
``
Let

be
wild

Let

*NL*
ride
on
the
merry-go-round
and
grab

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
considered
it
,
and
mumbled
to
Calibree
,
``
Think

would
*NL*
like

stop

Mrs.

smiled
in
a
washed-out
manner

and
sighed

Kennicott
summarized
the
whole
case
against
wildness

``

try
it
some

She
gave
it
up

She
looked
at
the
town

She
saw
that
in
adventuring
*NL*
from
Main
Street
,
Gopher
Prairie
,
to
Main
Street
,
Joralemon
,
she
had
not
*NL*
stirred

There
were
the

two-story
brick
groceries
with
lodge-signs
*NL*
above
the
awnings
;
the
same
one-story
wooden
millinery
shop
;
the

*NL*
fire-brick
garages
;
the
same
prairie
at
the
open
end

the
wide
*NL*
street
;
the
same
people
wondering
whether
the
levity
of
eating
a
hot-dog
*NL*
sandwich
would
break
their
taboos
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
reached
Gopher
Prairie
at
nine
in
the
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
look

said
Kennicott

broke

``
Why

He
worried
over
it
for
a
week
.
While
he
ground
his
plate
with
his
knife
*NL*
as
he
energetically
pursued
fragments
of
bacon
,
he
peeped
at

Dr.

Kennicott
was
brooding
in
his
office
,
during
a
free
*NL*
moment
toward
the
end
of
the
summer
afternoon
.
He
hunched
down
in
his
*NL*
tilted
desk-chair
,
undid
a
button
of
his
shirt
,
glanced
at
the
state
*NL*
news
in
the
back
of
the
Journal
of
the
American
Medical
Association
,
*NL*
dropped
the

leaned
back
with
his

thumb
hooked
in

arm-hole
of

his

stroking
the

splendid

if
I
was

had
the
nerve
*NL*
to
charge
the

that
those

do

If
a

stung
you
for
*NL*
a
hundred-dollar
consultation-fee
and
told
you
to
go
to
New

to
duck
*NL*
Dave

nagging

you

do
it

to
save

you

mowing

general

If

said

Go
to
New

Dave

you
*NL*
would
laugh
your
heads
off
and
say
,
`
Look
at
the
airs
Will
is
putting
*NL*
on
.
What
does
he
think
he
is
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
As

right

You
have
a
perfectly
well-developed

case

sex
instinct

and
it
raises
the
old
Ned
with
your

What
you
need
is
to
get
away
from

travel

yes

go
to

Thought

can
find

I

well

you
do

But
how
can
I
advise
*NL*
it
?
Dave
would
be
up
here
taking
my
hide
off

I
'm
willing

be
family
*NL*
physician

priest

lawyer

plumber

wet-nurse
,
but
I
draw
*NL*
the
line
at
making
Dave
loosen
up
on
money

Too
hard
a
job
in
weather
*NL*
like
this

So

savvy

my

Believe
it
will
rain
if
this
heat
*NL*
keeps

*NL*
*NL*

You

*NL*
just
LOVES
to
match

*NL*
at

he
pinches
a

him

He
crossed
over

patted
her
shoulder

Outside

window

beyond
the
*NL*
fly-screen
that
was
opaque
with
dust
and
cottonwood
lint

Main
Street
*NL*
was
hushed
except
for
the
impatient
throb
of
a
standing
motor
car

She
*NL*
took
his
firm

pressed
his
knuckles
against
her
cheek

*NL*
*NL*
``

When

He
fought
for
professional

Lingeringly

released

*NL*
*NL*
He
fled
from
himself

He
rammed
on
his
hat
,
threw
his
coat
over
his
arm
,
*NL*
banged
the
door
,
locked
it
,
tramped
downstairs

``
I
wo

he
said
*NL*
sturdily
and
,
as
he
said
it
,
he
would
have
given
a
good
deal
to
know
*NL*
whether
he
was
going
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
refreshed
,
as
always
,
by
the
familiar
windows
and
faces
.
It
*NL*
restored
his
soul
to
have
Sam
Clark
trustingly
bellow
,
``
Better

down

He
noted
the
*NL*
progress
on
the
new
garage

He
had
triumphed
in
the
laying
of
every
*NL*
course
of
bricks

in
them
he
had
seen
the
growth
of
the
town

His
pride

ushered
back
to

respectfulness

Sundquist

He
was
calmed
by
the
mechanicalness
of
the
tasks
at
home
:
*NL*
burning
the
gray
web
of
a
tent-worm
on
the
wild
cherry
tree
,
sealing
*NL*
with
gum
a
cut
in
the
right
front
tire
of
the
car
,
sprinkling
the
road
*NL*
before
the
house
.
The
hose
was
cool
to
his
hands
.
As
the
bright
arrows
*NL*
fell
with
a
faint
puttering
sound
,
a
crescent
of
blackness
was
formed
in
*NL*
the
gray
dust

*NL*
Dave

came
along

*NL*
Kennicott
had
not

entered

was
conscious
that

near

that
she
was
important

that
he
was
afraid
of
her
disapproval

he
was
content
to
be
alone

When
he
had
finished
sprinkling
he
*NL*
strolled
into
the
house
,
up
to
the
baby
's
room
,
and
cried
to
Hugh
,
*NL*
``
Story-time

*NL*
Carol
was
in
a
low
chair

framed
and
haloed
by
the
window
behind
her
,
*NL*
an
image
in
pale
gold
.
The
baby
curled
in
her
lap
,
his
head
on
her
arm
,
*NL*
listening
with
gravity
while
she
sang
from
Gene
Field
:

*NL*
'T

Luddy-Dud

*NL*
'T

And
all

long
*NL*
'T

the

dear
song

Of
that
growing

crowing

knowing
little

*NL*
Kennicott
was
enchanted

*NL*
*NL*
``
Maud

I
should
say
not

*NL*
*NL*
When
the
current
maid
bawled
up-stairs
,
``
Supper

table

Kennicott
*NL*
was
upon
his
back
,
flapping
his
hands
in
the
earnest
effort
to
be
a
*NL*
seal
,
thrilled
by
the
strength
with
which
his
son
kicked
him
.
He
slipped
*NL*
his
arm
about
Carol
's
shoulder
;
he
went
down
to
supper
rejoicing
that
he
*NL*
was
cleansed
of
perilous
stuff

While
Carol
was
putting
the

bed
he
sat
on
the
front
steps

Nat
Hicks

Between
waves
of
his

as
he
drove
off
mosquitos

Nat

whispered

The
way

treat

the
one

you
always
lose
at

On

the

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
CAROL
'S
liveliest
interest
was
in
her
walks
with
the
baby
.
Hugh
wanted
*NL*
to
know
what
the
box-elder
tree
said
,
and
what
the
Ford
garage
said
,
and
*NL*
what
the
big
cloud
said
,
and
she
told
him
,
with
a
feeling
that
she
was
*NL*
not
in
the
least
making
up
stories
,
but
discovering
the
souls
of
things
.
*NL*
They
had
an
especial
fondness
for
the
hitching-post
in
front
of
the
*NL*
mill
.
It
was
a
brown
post
,
stout
and
agreeable
;
the
smooth
leg
of
it
*NL*
held
the
sunlight
,
while
its
neck
,
grooved
by
hitching-straps
,
tickled
*NL*
one
's
fingers
.
Carol
had
never
been
awake
to
the
earth
except
as
a
show
*NL*
of
changing
color
and
great
satisfying
masses
;
she
had
lived
in
people
*NL*
and
in
ideas
about
having
ideas
;
but
Hugh
's
questions
made
her
attentive
*NL*
to
the
comedies
of
sparrows
,
robins
,
blue
jays
,
yellowhammers
;
she
*NL*
regained
her
pleasure
in
the
arching
flight
of
swallows
,
and
added
to
it
*NL*
a
solicitude
about
their
nests
and
family
squabbles
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
forgot
her
seasons
of
boredom
.
She
said
to
Hugh
,
``
We
're
two
fat
*NL*
disreputable
old
minstrels
roaming
round
the
world
,
''
and
he
echoed
her
,
*NL*
``
Roamin
'
round
--
roamin
'
round
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
high
adventure
,
the
secret
place
to
which
they
both
fled
joyously
,
*NL*
was
the
house
of
Miles
and
Bea
and
Olaf
Bjornstam
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
steadily
disapproved
of
the
Bjornstams
.
He
protested
,
``
What
*NL*
do
you
want
to
talk
to
that
crank
for
?
''
He
hinted
that
a
former
``
Swede
*NL*
hired
girl
''
was
low
company
for
the
son
of
Dr.
Will
Kennicott
.
She
did
*NL*
not
explain
.
She
did
not
quite
understand
it
herself
;
did
not
know
that
*NL*
in
the
Bjornstams
she
found
her
friends
,
her
club
,
her
sympathy
and
her
*NL*
ration
of
blessed
cynicism
.
For
a
time
the
gossip
of
Juanita
Haydock
and
*NL*
the
Jolly
Seventeen
had
been
a
refuge
from
the
droning
of
Aunt
Bessie
,
*NL*
but
the
relief
had
not
continued
.
The
young
matrons
made
her
nervous
.
*NL*
They
talked
so
loud
,
always
so
loud
.
They
filled
a
room
with
*NL*
clashing
cackle
;
their
jests
and
gags
they
repeated
nine
times
over
.
*NL*
Unconsciously
,
she
had
discarded
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
Guy
Pollock
,
Vida
,
*NL*
and
every
one
save
Mrs.
Dr.
Westlake
and
the
friends
whom
she
did
not
*NL*
clearly
know
as
friends
--
the
Bjornstams
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Hugh
,
the
Red
Swede
was
the
most
heroic
and
powerful
person
in
the
*NL*
world
.
With
unrestrained
adoration
he
trotted
after
while
Miles
fed
the
*NL*
cows
,
chased
his
one
pig
--
an
animal
of
lax
and
migratory
instincts
--
or
*NL*
dramatically
slaughtered
a
chicken
.
And
to
Hugh
,
Olaf
was
lord
among
*NL*
mortal
men
,
less
stalwart
than
the
old
monarch
,
King
Miles
,
but
more
*NL*
understanding
of
the
relations
and
values
of
things
,
of
small
sticks
,
*NL*
lone
playing-cards
,
and
irretrievably
injured
hoops
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
saw
,
though
she
did
not
admit
,
that
Olaf
was
not
only
more
*NL*
beautiful
than
her
own
dark
child
,
but
more
gracious
.
Olaf
was
a
Norse
*NL*
chieftain
:
straight
,
sunny-haired
,
large-limbed
,
resplendently
amiable
*NL*
to
his
subjects
.
Hugh
was
a
vulgarian
;
a
bustling
business
man
.
It
was
*NL*
Hugh
that
bounced
and
said
``
Let
's
play
''
;
Olaf
that
opened
luminous
blue
*NL*
eyes
and
agreed
``
All
right
,
''
in
condescending
gentleness
.
If
Hugh
batted
*NL*
him
--
and
Hugh
did
bat
him
--
Olaf
was
unafraid
but
shocked
.
In
magnificent
*NL*
solitude
he
marched
toward
the
house
,
while
Hugh
bewailed
his
sin
and
*NL*
the
overclouding
of
august
favor
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
friends
played
with
an
imperial
chariot
which
Miles
had
made
out
*NL*
of
a
starch-box
and
four
red
spools
;
together
they
stuck
switches
into
*NL*
a
mouse-hole
,
with
vast
satisfaction
though
entirely
without
known
*NL*
results
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
,
the
chubby
and
humming
Bea
,
impartially
gave
cookies
and
scoldings
*NL*
to
both
children
,
and
if
Carol
refused
a
cup
of
coffee
and
a
wafer
of
*NL*
buttered
knackebrod
,
she
was
desolated
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
had
done
well
with
his
dairy
.
He
had
six
cows
,
two
hundred
*NL*
chickens
,
a
cream
separator
,
a
Ford
truck
.
In
the
spring
he
had
built
a
*NL*
two-room
addition
to
his
shack
.
That
illustrious
building
was
to
Hugh
a
*NL*
carnival
.
Uncle
Miles
did
the
most
spectacular
,
unexpected
things
:
ran
*NL*
up
the
ladder
;
stood
on
the
ridge-pole
,
waving
a
hammer
and
singing
*NL*
something
about
``
To
arms
,
my
citizens
''
;
nailed
shingles
faster
than
*NL*
Aunt
Bessie
could
iron
handkerchiefs
;
and
lifted
a
two-by-six
with
Hugh
*NL*
riding
on
one
end
and
Olaf
on
the
other
.
Uncle
Miles
's
most
ecstatic
*NL*
trick
was
to
make
figures
not
on
paper
but
right
on
a
new
pine
board
,
*NL*
with
the
broadest
softest
pencil
in
the
world
.
There
was
a
thing
worth
*NL*
seeing
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
tools
!
In
his
office
Father
had
tools
fascinating
in
their
shininess
*NL*
and
curious
shapes
,
but
they
were
sharp
,
they
were
something
called
*NL*
sterized
,
and
they
distinctly
were
not
for
boys
to
touch
.
In
fact
it
*NL*
was
a
good
dodge
to
volunteer
``
I
must
not
touch
,
''
when
you
looked
at
the
*NL*
tools
on
the
glass
shelves
in
Father
's
office
.
But
Uncle
Miles
,
who
*NL*
was
a
person
altogether
superior
to
Father
,
let
you
handle
all
his
kit
*NL*
except
the
saws
.
There
was
a
hammer
with
a
silver
head
;
there
was
a
*NL*
metal
thing
like
a
big
L
;
there
was
a
magic
instrument
,
very
precious
,
*NL*
made
out
of
costly
red
wood
and
gold
,
with
a
tube
which
contained
a
*NL*
drop
--
no
,
it
was
n't
a
drop
,
it
was
a
nothing
,
which
lived
in
the
water
,
*NL*
but
the
nothing
LOOKED
like
a
drop
,
and
it
ran
in
a
frightened
way
*NL*
up
and
down
the
tube
,
no
matter
how
cautiously
you
tilted
the
magic
*NL*
instrument
.
And
there
were
nails
,
very
different
and
clever
--
big
*NL*
valiant
spikes
,
middle-sized
ones
which
were
not
very
interesting
,
and
*NL*
shingle-nails
much
jollier
than
the
fussed-up
fairies
in
the
yellow
*NL*
book
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
had
worked
on
the
addition
Miles
had
talked
frankly
to
Carol
.
*NL*
He
admitted
now
that
so
long
as
he
stayed
in
Gopher
Prairie
he
would
*NL*
remain
a
pariah
.
Bea
's
Lutheran
friends
were
as
much
offended
by
his
*NL*
agnostic
gibes
as
the
merchants
by
his
radicalism
.
``
And
I
ca
n't
seem
to
*NL*
keep
my
mouth
shut
.
I
think
I
'm
being
a
baa-lamb
,
and
not
springing
any
*NL*
theories
wilder
than
`
c-a-t
spells
cat
,
'
but
when
folks
have
gone
,
I
*NL*
re
`
lize
I
've
been
stepping
on
their
pet
religious
corns
.
Oh
,
the
mill
*NL*
foreman
keeps
dropping
in
,
and
that
Danish
shoemaker
,
and
one
fellow
*NL*
from
Elder
's
factory
,
and
a
few
Svenskas
,
but
you
know
Bea
:
big
*NL*
good-hearted
wench
like
her
wants
a
lot
of
folks
around

likes
to
fuss
*NL*
over
'em
--
never
satisfied
unless
she
tiring
herself
out
making
coffee
*NL*
for
somebody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Once
she
kidnapped
me
and
drug
me
to
the
Methodist
Church
.
I
goes
in
,
*NL*
pious
as
Widow
Bogart
,
and
sits
still
and
never
cracks
a
smile
while
*NL*
the
preacher
is
favoring
us
with
his
misinformation
on
evolution
.
But
*NL*
afterwards
,
when
the
old
stalwarts
were
pumphandling
everybody
at
the
*NL*
door
and
calling
'em
`
Brother
'
and
`
Sister
,
'
they
let
me
sail
right
by
*NL*
with
nary
a
clinch
.
They
figure
I
'm
the
town
badman
.
Always
will
be
,
I
*NL*
guess
.
It
'll
have
to
be
Olaf
who
goes
on
.
`
And
sometimes
--
Blamed
if
I
*NL*
do
n't
feel
like
coming
out
and
saying
,
`
I
've
been
conservative
.
Nothing
*NL*
to
it
.
Now
I
'm
going
to
start
something
in
these
rotten
one-horse
*NL*
lumber-camps
west
of
town
.
'
But
Bea
's
got
me
hypnotized
.
Lord
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Kennicott
,
do
you
re
`
lize
what
a
jolly
,
square
,
faithful
woman
she
is
?
*NL*
And
I
love
Olaf
--
Oh
well
,
I
wo
n't
go
and
get
sentimental
on
you
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course
I
've
had
thoughts
of
pulling
up
stakes
and
going
West
.
Maybe
*NL*
if
they
did
n't
know
it
beforehand
,
they
would
n't
find
out
I
'd
ever
been
*NL*
guilty
of
trying
to
think
for
myself
.
But
--
oh
,
I
've
worked
hard
,
and
*NL*
built
up
this
dairy
business
,
and
I
hate
to
start
all
over
again
,
and
*NL*
move
Bea
and
the
kid
into
another
one-room
shack
.
That
's
how
they
get
*NL*
us
!
Encourage
us
to
be
thrifty
and
own
our
own
houses
,
and
then
,
by
*NL*
golly
,
they
've
got
us
;
they
know
we
wo
n't
dare
risk
everything
by
*NL*
committing
lez
--
what
is
it
?
lez
majesty
?
--
I
mean
they
know
we
wo
n't
be
*NL*
hinting
around
that
if
we
had
a
co-operative
bank
,
we
could
get
along
*NL*
without
Stowbody
.
Well
--
As
long
as
I
can
sit
and
play
pinochle
with
*NL*
Bea
,
and
tell
whoppers
to
Olaf
about
his
daddy
's
adventures
in
the
*NL*
woods
,
and
how
he
snared
a
wapaloosie
and
knew
Paul
Bunyan
,
why
,
I
*NL*
do
n't
mind
being
a
bum
.
It
's
just
for
them
that
I
mind
.
Say
!
Say
!
Do
n't
*NL*
whisper
a
word
to
Bea
,
but
when
I
get
this
addition
done
,
I
'm
going
to
*NL*
buy
her
a
phonograph
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
busy
with
the
activities
her
work-hungry
muscles
*NL*
found
--
washing
,
ironing
,
mending
,
baking
,
dusting
,
preserving
,
plucking
*NL*
a
chicken
,
painting
the
sink
;
tasks
which
,
because
she
was
Miles
's
full
*NL*
partner
,
were
exciting
and
creative
--
Bea
listened
to
the
phonograph
*NL*
records
with
rapture
like
that
of
cattle
in
a
warm
stable
.
The
addition
*NL*
gave
her
a
kitchen
with
a
bedroom
above
.
The
original
one-room
shack
was
*NL*
now
a
living-room
,
with
the
phonograph
,
a
genuine
leather-upholstered
*NL*
golden-oak
rocker
,
and
a
picture
of
Governor
John
Johnson
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
late
July
Carol
went
to
the
Bjornstams
'
desirous
of
a
chance
to
*NL*
express
her
opinion
of
Beavers
and
Calibrees
and
Joralemons
.
She
found
*NL*
Olaf
abed
,
restless
from
a
slight
fever
,
and
Bea
flushed
and
dizzy
but
*NL*
trying
to
keep
up
her
work
.
She
lured
Miles
aside
and
worried
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
n't
look
at
all
well
.
What
's
the
matter
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Their
stomachs
are
out
of
whack
.
I
wanted
to
call
in
Doc
Kennicott
,
but
*NL*
Bea
thinks
the
doc
does
n't
like
us
--
she
thinks
maybe
he
's
sore
because
*NL*
you
come
down
here
.
But
I
'm
getting
worried
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
going
to
call
the
doctor
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
yearned
over
Olaf
.
His
lambent
eyes
were
stupid
,
he
moaned
,
he
*NL*
rubbed
his
forehead
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
they
been
eating
something
that
's
been
bad
for
them
?
''
she
*NL*
fluttered
to
Miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Might
be
bum
water
.
I
'll
tell
you
:
We
used
to
get
our
water
at
Oscar
*NL*
Eklund
's
place
,
over
across
the
street
,
but
Oscar
kept
dinging
at
me
,
*NL*
and
hinting
I
was
a
tightwad
not
to
dig
a
well
of
my
own
.
One
time
*NL*
he
said
,
`
Sure
,
you
socialists
are
great
on
divvying
up
other
folks
'
*NL*
money
--
and
water
!
'
I
knew
if
he
kept
it
up
there
'd
be
a
fuss
,
and
I
*NL*
ai
n't
safe
to
have
around
,
once
a
fuss
starts
;
I
'm
likely
to
forget
*NL*
myself
and
let
loose
with
a
punch
in
the
snoot
.
I
offered
to
pay
Oscar
*NL*
but
he
refused
--
he
'd
rather
have
the
chance
to
kid
me
.
So
I
starts
*NL*
getting
water
down
at
Mrs.
Fageros
's
,
in
the
hollow
there
,
and
I
do
n't
*NL*
believe
it
's
real
good
.
Figuring
to
dig
my
own
well
this
fall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
One
scarlet
word
was
before
Carol
's
eyes
while
she
listened
.
She
fled
to
*NL*
Kennicott
's
office
.
He
gravely
heard
her
out
;
nodded
,
said
,
``
Be
right
*NL*
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
examined
Bea
and
Olaf
.
He
shook
his
head
.
``
Yes
.
Looks
to
me
like
*NL*
typhoid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Golly
,
I
've
seen
typhoid
in
lumber-camps
,
''
groaned
Miles
,
all
the
*NL*
strength
dripping
out
of
him
.
``
Have
they
got
it
very
bad
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
we
'll
take
good
care
of
them
,
''
said
Kennicott
,
and
for
the
first
*NL*
time
in
their
acquaintance
he
smiled
on
Miles
and
clapped
his
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wo
n't
you
need
a
nurse
?
''
demanded
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
''
To
Miles
,
Kennicott
hinted
,
``
Could
n't
you
get
Bea
's
cousin
,
*NL*
Tina
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
's
down
at
the
old
folks
'
,
in
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
me
do
it
!
''
Carol
insisted
.
``
They
need
some
one
to
cook
for
*NL*
them
,
and
is
n't
it
good
to
give
them
sponge
baths
,
in
typhoid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
All
right
.
''
Kennicott
was
automatic
;
he
was
the
official
,
the
*NL*
physician
.
``
I
guess
probably
it
would
be
hard
to
get
a
nurse
here
in
*NL*
town
just
now
.
Mrs.
Stiver
is
busy
with
an
obstetrical
case
,
and
that
*NL*
town
nurse
of
yours
is
off
on
vacation
,
ai
n't
she
?
All
right
,
Bjornstam
*NL*
can
spell
you
at
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
All
week
,
from
eight
each
morning
till
midnight
,
Carol
fed
them
,
bathed
*NL*
them
,
smoothed
sheets
,
took
temperatures
.
Miles
refused
to
let
her
cook
.
*NL*
Terrified
,
pallid
,
noiseless
in
stocking
feet
,
he
did
the
kitchen
work
*NL*
and
the
sweeping
,
his
big
red
hands
awkwardly
careful
.
Kennicott
came
*NL*
in
three
times
a
day
,
unchangingly
tender
and
hopeful
in
the
sick-room
,
*NL*
evenly
polite
to
Miles
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
understood
how
great
was
her
love
for
her
friends
.
It
bore
*NL*
her
through
;
it
made
her
arm
steady
and
tireless
to
bathe
them
.
*NL*
What
exhausted
her
was
the
sight
of
Bea
and
Olaf
turned
into
flaccid
*NL*
invalids
,
uncomfortably
flushed
after
taking
food
,
begging
for
the
*NL*
healing
of
sleep
at
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
During
the
second
week
Olaf
's
powerful
legs
were
flabby
.
Spots
of
a
*NL*
viciously
delicate
pink
came
out
on
his
chest
and
back
.
His
cheeks
sank
.
*NL*
He
looked
frightened
.
His
tongue
was
brown
and
revolting
.
His
confident
*NL*
voice
dwindled
to
a
bewildered
murmur
,
ceaseless
and
racking
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
had
stayed
on
her
feet
too
long
at
the
beginning
.
The
moment
*NL*
Kennicott
had
ordered
her
to
bed
she
had
begun
to
collapse
.
One
early
*NL*
evening
she
startled
them
by
screaming
,
in
an
intense
abdominal
pain
,
*NL*
and
within
half
an
hour
she
was
in
a
delirium
.
Till
dawn
Carol
was
*NL*
with
her
,
and
not
all
of
Bea
's
groping
through
the
blackness
of
*NL*
half-delirious
pain
was
so
pitiful
to
Carol
as
the
way
in
which
Miles
*NL*
silently
peered
into
the
room
from
the
top
of
the
narrow
stairs
.
*NL*
Carol
slept
three
hours
next
morning
,
and
ran
back
.
Bea
was
altogether
*NL*
delirious
but
she
muttered
nothing
save
,
``
Olaf
--
ve
have
such
a
good
*NL*
time
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
At
ten
,
while
Carol
was
preparing
an
ice-bag
in
the
kitchen
,
Miles
*NL*
answered
a
knock
.
At
the
front
door
she
saw
Vida
Sherwin
,
Maud
Dyer
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Zitterel
,
wife
of
the
Baptist
pastor
.
They
were
carrying
grapes
,
*NL*
and
women
's
-
magazines
,
magazines
with
high-colored
pictures
and
*NL*
optimistic
fiction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
just
heard
your
wife
was
sick
.
We
've
come
to
see
if
there
is
n't
*NL*
something
we
can
do
,
''
chirruped
Vida
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
looked
steadily
at
the
three
women
.
``
You
're
too
late
.
You
ca
n't
*NL*
do
nothing
now
.
Bea
's
always
kind
of
hoped
that
you
folks
would
come
see
*NL*
her
.
She
wanted
to
have
a
chance
and
be
friends
.
She
used
to
sit
waiting
*NL*
for
somebody
to
knock
.
I
've
seen
her
sitting
here
,
waiting
.
Now
--
Oh
,
*NL*
you
ai
n't
worth
God-damning
.
''
He
shut
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
day
Carol
watched
Olaf
's
strength
oozing
.
He
was
emaciated
.
His
ribs
*NL*
were
grim
clear
lines
,
his
skin
was
clammy
,
his
pulse
was
feeble
but
*NL*
terrifyingly
rapid
.
It
beat
--
beat
--
beat
in
a
drum-roll
of
death
.
Late
*NL*
that
afternoon
he
sobbed
,
and
died
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bea
did
not
know
it
.
She
was
delirious
.
Next
morning
,
when
she
went
,
*NL*
she
did
not
know
that
Olaf
would
no
longer
swing
his
lath
sword
on
the
*NL*
door-step
,
no
longer
rule
his
subjects
of
the
cattle-yard
;
that
Miles
's
*NL*
son
would
not
go
East
to
college
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
,
Carol
,
Kennicott
were
silent
.
They
washed
the
bodies
together
,
*NL*
their
eyes
veiled
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
home
now
and
sleep
.
You
're
pretty
tired
.
I
ca
n't
ever
pay
you
back
*NL*
for
what
you
done
,
''
Miles
whispered
to
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
But
I
'll
be
back
here
tomorrow
.
Go
with
you
to
the
funeral
,
''
she
*NL*
said
laboriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
time
for
the
funeral
came
,
Carol
was
in
bed
,
collapsed
.
She
*NL*
assumed
that
neighbors
would
go
.
They
had
not
told
her
that
word
of
*NL*
Miles
's
rebuff
to
Vida
had
spread
through
town
,
a
cyclonic
fury
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
only
by
chance
that
,
leaning
on
her
elbow
in
bed
,
she
glanced
*NL*
through
the
window
and
saw
the
funeral
of
Bea
and
Olaf
.
There
was
*NL*
no
music
,
no
carriages
.
There
was
only
Miles
Bjornstam
,
in
his
black
*NL*
wedding-suit
,
walking
quite
alone
,
head
down
,
behind
the
shabby
hearse
*NL*
that
bore
the
bodies
of
his
wife
and
baby
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
hour
after
,
Hugh
came
into
her
room
crying
,
and
when
she
said
as
*NL*
cheerily
as
she
could
,
``
What
is
it
,
dear
?
''
he
besought
,
``
Mummy
,
I
want
*NL*
to
go
play
with
Olaf
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
afternoon
Juanita
Haydock
dropped
in
to
brighten
Carol
.
She
said
,
*NL*
``
Too
bad
about
this
Bea
that
was
your
hired
girl
.
But
I
do
n't
waste
*NL*
any
sympathy
on
that
man
of
hers
.
Everybody
says
he
drank
too
much
,
and
*NL*
treated
his
family
awful
,
and
that
's
how
they
got
sick
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
A
LETTER
from
Raymie
Wutherspoon
,
in
France
,
said
that
he
had
been
sent
*NL*
to
the
front
,
been
slightly
wounded
,
been
made
a
captain
.
From
Vida
's
*NL*
pride
Carol
sought
to
draw
a
stimulant
to
rouse
her
from
depression
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miles
had
sold
his
dairy
.
He
had
several
thousand
dollars
.
To
Carol
he
*NL*
said
good-by
with
a
mumbled
word
,
a
harsh
hand-shake
,
``
Going
to
buy
a
*NL*
farm
in
northern
Alberta
--
far
off
from
folks
as
I
can
get
.
''
He
turned
*NL*
sharply
away
,
but
he
did
not
walk
with
his
former
spring
.
His
shoulders
*NL*
seemed
old
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
said
that
before
he
went
he
cursed
the
town
.
There
was
talk
*NL*
of
arresting
him
,
of
riding
him
on
a
rail
.
It
was
rumored
that
at
the
*NL*
station
old
Champ
Perry
rebuked
him
,
``
You
better
not
come
back
here
.
*NL*
We
've
got
respect
for
your
dead
,
but
we
have
n't
got
any
for
a
blasphemer
*NL*
and
a
traitor
that
wo
n't
do
anything
for
his
country
and
only
bought
one
*NL*
Liberty
Bond
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Some
of
the
people
who
had
been
at
the
station
declared
that
Miles
made
*NL*
some
dreadful
seditious
retort
:
something
about
loving
German
workmen
*NL*
more
than
American
bankers
;
but
others
asserted
that
he
could
n't
find
*NL*
one
word
with
which
to
answer
the
veteran
;
that
he
merely
sneaked
up
on
*NL*
the
platform
of
the
train

He
must
have
felt
guilty
,
everybody
agreed
,
*NL*
for
as
the
train
left
town
,
a
farmer
saw
him
standing
in
the
vestibule
*NL*
and
looking
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
house
--
with
the
addition
which
he
had
built
four
months
ago
--
was
*NL*
very
near
the
track
on
which
his
train
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carol
went
there
,
for
the
last
time
,
she
found
Olaf
's
chariot
with
*NL*
its
red
spool
wheels
standing
in
the
sunny
corner
beside
the
stable
.
She
*NL*
wondered
if
a
quick
eye
could
have
noticed
it
from
a
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
day
and
that
week
she
went
reluctantly
to
Red
Cross
work
;
she
*NL*
stitched
and
packed
silently
,
while
Vida
read
the
war
bulletins
.
And
she
*NL*
said
nothing
at
all
when
Kennicott
commented
,
``
From
what
Champ
says
,
*NL*
I
guess
Bjornstam
was
a
bad
egg
,
after
all
.
In
spite
of
Bea

do
n't
*NL*
know
but
what
the
citizens

committee
ought
to
have
forced
him
to
*NL*
be
patriotic

let
on
like
they
could
send
him
to
jail
if
he
did
n't
*NL*
volunteer
and
come
through
for
bonds

*NL*
She
found
no
inspiration
but
she
did
find
a
dependable
kindness
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Westlake
,
and
at
last
she
yielded
to
the
old
woman
's
receptivity
and
had
*NL*
relief
in
sobbing
the
story
of
Bea
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
Pollock
she
often
met
on
the
street
,
but
he
was
merely
a
pleasant
*NL*
voice
which
said
things
about
Charles
Lamb
and
sunsets
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
most
positive
experience
was
the
revelation
of
Mrs.
Flickerbaugh
,
*NL*
the
tall
,
thin
,
twitchy
wife
of
the
attorney
.
Carol
encountered
her
at
*NL*
the
drug
store
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walking

snapped
Mrs.
Flickerbaugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

yes

*NL*
*NL*
``
Humph

Guess
you
're
the

Come
home

have
a
cup

tea
with
me

*NL*
*NL*
Because
she
had
nothing
else
to
do
,
Carol
went
.
But
she
was
*NL*
uncomfortable
in
the
presence
of
the
amused
stares
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Flickerbaugh
's
raiment
drew
.
Today
,
in
reeking
early
August
,
she
wore
a
*NL*
man
's
cap
,
a
skinny
fur
like
a
dead
cat
,
a
necklace
of
imitation
pearls
,
*NL*
a
scabrous
satin
blouse

up
in

There

Mrs.

old

Too

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
sat
on
the
gritty
couch
,
and
sank
into
fear
.
Could
this
drabness
*NL*
of
life
keep
up
forever
,
then
?
Would
she
some
day
so
despise
herself
*NL*
and
her
neighbors
that
she
too
would
walk
Main
Street
an
old
skinny
*NL*
eccentric
woman
in
a
mangy
cat
's
-
fur
?
As
she
crept
home
she
felt
that
*NL*
the
trap
had
finally
closed
.
She
went
into
the
house
,
a
frail
small
*NL*
woman
,
still
winsome
but
hopeless
of
eye
as
she
staggered
with
the
*NL*
weight
of
the
drowsy
boy
in
her
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
alone
on
the
porch
,
that
evening
.
It
seemed
that
Kennicott
had
*NL*
to
make
a
professional
call
on
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Under
the
stilly
boughs
and
the
black
gauze
of
dusk
the
street
was
*NL*
meshed
in
silence
.
There
was
but
the
hum
of
motor
tires
crunching
the
*NL*
road
,
the
creak
of
a
rocker
on
the
Howlands
'
porch
,
the
slap
of
a
hand
*NL*
attacking
a
mosquito
,
a
heat-weary
conversation
starting
and
dying
,
the
*NL*
precise
rhythm
of
crickets
,
the
thud
of
moths
against
the
screen
--
sounds
*NL*
that
were
a
distilled
silence
.
It
was
a
street
beyond
the
end
of
*NL*
the
world
,
beyond
the
boundaries
of
hope
.
Though
she
should
sit
here
*NL*
forever
,
no
brave
procession
,
no
one
who
was
interesting
,
would
be
*NL*
coming
by
.
It
was
tediousness
made
tangible
,
a
street
builded
of
*NL*
lassitude
and
of
futility
.
*NL*
*NL*
Myrtle
Cass
appeared
,
with
Cy
Bogart
.
She
giggled
and
bounced
when
Cy
*NL*
tickled
her
ear
in
village
love
.
They
strolled
with
the
half-dancing
*NL*
gait
of
lovers
,
kicking
their
feet
out
sideways
or
shuffling
a
dragging
*NL*
jig
,
and
the
concrete
walk
sounded
to
the
broken
two-four
rhythm
.
Their
*NL*
voices
had
a
dusky
turbulence
.
Suddenly
,
to
the
woman
rocking
on
the
*NL*
porch
of
the
doctor
's
house
,
the
night
came
alive
,
and
she
felt
that
*NL*
everywhere
in
the
darkness
panted
an
ardent
quest
which
she
was
missing
*NL*
as
she
sank
back
to
wait
for
--
There
must
be
something
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
IT
WAS
at
a
supper
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
in
August
that
Carol
heard
of
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
,
''
from
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
fond
of
Maud
Dyer
,
because
she
had
been
particularly
agreeable
*NL*
lately
;
had
obviously
repented
of
the
nervous
distaste
which
she
had
*NL*
once
shown
.
Maud
patted
her
hand
when
they
met
,
and
asked
about
Hugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
said
that
he
was
``
kind
of
sorry
for
the
girl
,
some
ways
;
she
's
*NL*
too
darn
emotional
,
but
still
,
Dave
is
sort
of
mean
to
her
.
''
He
was
*NL*
polite
to
poor
Maud
when
they
all
went
down
to
the
cottages
for
a
swim
.
*NL*
Carol
was
proud
of
that
sympathy
in
him
,
and
now
she
took
pains
to
sit
*NL*
with
their
new
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dyer
was
bubbling
,
``
Oh
,
have
you
folks
heard
about
this
young
*NL*
fellow
that
's
just
come
to
town
that
the
boys
call
`
Elizabeth
'
?
He
's
*NL*
working
in
Nat
Hicks
's
tailor
shop
.
I
bet
he
does
n't
make
eighteen
a
*NL*
week
,
but
my
!
is
n't
he
the
perfect
lady
though
!
He
talks
so
refined
,
and
*NL*
oh
,
the
lugs
he
puts
on
--
belted
coat
,
and
pique
collar
with
a
gold
pin
,
*NL*
and
socks
to
match
his
necktie
,
and
honest
--
you
wo
n't
believe
this
,
but
*NL*
I
got
it
straight
--
this
fellow
,
you
know
he
's
staying
at
Mrs.
Gurrey
's
*NL*
punk
old
boarding-house
,
and
they
say
he
asked
Mrs.
Gurrey
if
he
ought
*NL*
to
put
on
a
dress-suit
for
supper
!
Imagine
!
Can
you
beat
that
?
And
him
*NL*
nothing
but
a
Swede
tailor
--
Erik
Valborg
his
name
is
.
But
he
used
to
be
*NL*
in
a
tailor
shop
in
Minneapolis
-LRB-
they
do
say
he
's
a
smart
needle-pusher
,
*NL*
at
that
-RRB-
and
he
tries
to
let
on
that
he
's
a
regular
city
fellow
.
They
*NL*
say
he
tries
to
make
people
think
he
's
a
poet
--
carries
books
around
and
*NL*
pretends
to
read
'em
.
Myrtle
Cass
says
she
met
him
at
a
dance
,
and
he
*NL*
was
mooning
around
all
over
the
place
,
and
he
asked
her
did
she
like
*NL*
flowers
and
poetry
and
music
and
everything
;
he
spieled
like
he
was
a
*NL*
regular
United
States
Senator
;
and
Myrtle
--
she
's
a
devil
,
that
girl
,
*NL*
ha
!
ha
!
--
she
kidded
him
along
,
and
got
him
going
,
and
honest
,
what
d'you
*NL*
think
he
said
?
He
said
he
did
n't
find
any
intellectual
companionship
*NL*
in
this
town
.
Can
you
BEAT
it
?
Imagine
!
And
him
a
Swede
tailor
!
My
!
And
*NL*
they
say
he
's
the
most
awful
mollycoddle
--
looks
just
like
a
girl
.
The
*NL*
boys
call
him
`
Elizabeth
,
'
and
they
stop
him
and
ask
about
the
books
he
*NL*
lets
on
to
have
read
,
and
he
goes
and
tells
them
,
and
they
take
it
*NL*
all
in
and
jolly
him
terribly
,
and
he
never
gets
onto
the
fact
they
're
*NL*
kidding
him
.
Oh
,
I
think
it
's
just
TOO
funny
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jolly
Seventeen
laughed
,
and
Carol
laughed
with
them
.
Mrs.
Jack
*NL*
Elder
added
that
this
Erik
Valborg
had
confided
to
Mrs.
Gurrey
that
he
*NL*
would
``
love
to
design
clothes
for
women
.
''
Imagine
!
Mrs.
Harvey
Dillon
*NL*
had
had
a
glimpse
of
him
,
but
honestly
,
she
'd
thought
he
was
awfully
*NL*
handsome
.
This
was
instantly
controverted
by
Mrs.
B.
J.
Gougerling
,
wife
*NL*
of
the
banker
.
Mrs.
Gougerling
had
had
,
she
reported
,
a
good
look
*NL*
at
this
Valborg
fellow
.
She
and
B.
J.
had
been
motoring
,
and
passed
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
''
out
by
McGruder
's
Bridge
.
He
was
wearing
the
awfullest
*NL*
clothes
,
with
the
waist
pinched
in
like
a
girl
's
.
He
was
sitting
on
*NL*
a
rock
doing
nothing
,
but
when
he
heard
the
Gougerling
car
coming
he
*NL*
snatched
a
book
out
of
his
pocket
,
and
as
they
went
by
he
pretended
to
*NL*
be
reading
it
,
to
show
off
.
And
he
was
n't
really
good-looking
--
just
kind
*NL*
of
soft
,
as
B.
J.
had
pointed
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
husbands
came
they
joined
in
the
expose
.
``
My
name
is
Elizabeth
.
*NL*
I
'm
the
celebrated
musical
tailor
.
The
skirts
fall
for
me
by
the
thou
.
*NL*
Do
I
get
some
more
veal
loaf
?
''
merrily
shrieked
Dave
Dyer
.
He
had
some
*NL*
admirable
stories
about
the
tricks
the
town
youngsters
had
played
on
*NL*
Valborg
.
They
had
dropped
a
decaying
perch
into
his
pocket
.
They
had
*NL*
pinned
on
his
back
a
sign
,
``
I
'm
the
prize
boob
,
kick
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Glad
of
any
laughter
,
Carol
joined
the
frolic
,
and
surprised
them
by
*NL*
crying
,
``
Dave
,
I
do
think
you
're
the
dearest
thing
since
you
got
your
*NL*
hair
cut
!
''
That
was
an
excellent
sally
.
Everybody
applauded
.
Kennicott
*NL*
looked
proud
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
decided
that
sometime
she
really
must
go
out
of
her
way
to
pass
*NL*
Hicks
's
shop
and
see
this
freak
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
Sunday
morning
service
at
the
Baptist
Church
,
in
a
solemn
row
*NL*
with
her
husband
,
Hugh
,
Uncle
Whittier
,
Aunt
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Despite
Aunt
Bessie
's
nagging
the
Kennicotts
rarely
attended
church
.
The
*NL*
doctor
asserted
,
``
Sure
,
religion
is
a
fine
influence
--
got
to
have
it
to
*NL*
keep
the
lower
classes
in
order
--
fact
,
it
's
the
only
thing
that
appeals
*NL*
to
a
lot
of
those
fellows
and
makes
'em
respect
the
rights
of
property
.
*NL*
And
I
guess
this
theology
is
O.K.
;
lot
of
wise
old
coots
figured
it
*NL*
all
out
,
and
they
knew
more
about
it
than
we
do
.
''
He
believed
in
the
*NL*
Christian
religion
,
and
never
thought
about
it
,
he
believed
in
the
*NL*
church
,
and
seldom
went
near
it
;
he
was
shocked
by
Carol
's
lack
of
*NL*
faith
,
and
was
n't
quite
sure
what
was
the
nature
of
the
faith
that
she
*NL*
lacked
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
herself
was
an
uneasy
and
dodging
agnostic
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
ventured
to
Sunday
School
and
heard
the
teachers
droning
that
*NL*
the
genealogy
of
Shamsherai
was
a
valuable
ethical
problem
for
children
*NL*
to
think
about
;
when
she
experimented
with
Wednesday
prayer-meeting
and
*NL*
listened
to
store-keeping
elders
giving
their
unvarying
weekly
testimony
*NL*
in
primitive
erotic
symbols
and
such
gory
Chaldean
phrases
as
``
washed
*NL*
in
the
blood
of
the
lamb
''
and
``
a
vengeful
God
''
;
when
Mrs.
Bogart
boasted
*NL*
that
through
his
boyhood
she
had
made
Cy
confess
nightly
upon
the
basis
*NL*
of
the
Ten
Commandments
;
then
Carol
was
dismayed
to
find
the
Christian
*NL*
religion
,
in
America
,
in
the
twentieth
century
,
as
abnormal
as
*NL*
Zoroastrianism
--
without
the
splendor
.
But
when
she
went
to
church
*NL*
suppers
and
felt
the
friendliness
,
saw
the
gaiety
with
which
the
sisters
*NL*
served
cold
ham
and
scalloped
potatoes
;
when
Mrs.
Champ
Perry
cried
to
*NL*
her
,
on
an
afternoon
call
,
``
My
dear
,
if
you
just
knew
how
happy
it
makes
*NL*
you
to
come
into
abiding
grace
,
''
then
Carol
found
the
humanness
behind
*NL*
the
sanguinary
and
alien
theology
.
Always
she
perceived
that
the
*NL*
churches
--
Methodist
,
Baptist
,
Congregational
,
Catholic
,
all
of
*NL*
them
--
which
had
seemed
so
unimportant
to
the
judge
's
home
in
her
*NL*
childhood
,
so
isolated
from
the
city
struggle
in
St.
Paul
,
were
*NL*
still
,
in
Gopher
Prairie
,
the
strongest
of
the
forces
compelling
*NL*
respectability
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
August
Sunday
she
had
been
tempted
by
the
announcement
that
the
*NL*
Reverend
Edmund
Zitterel
would
preach
on
the
topic
``
America
,
Face
Your
*NL*
Problems
!
''
With
the
great
war
,
workmen
in
every
nation
showing
a
desire
*NL*
to
control
industries
,
Russia
hinting
a
leftward
revolution
against
*NL*
Kerensky
,
woman
suffrage
coming
,
there
seemed
to
be
plenty
of
problems
*NL*
for
the
Reverend
Mr.
Zitterel
to
call
on
America
to
face
.
Carol
gathered
*NL*
her
family
and
trotted
off
behind
Uncle
Whittier
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
congregation
faced
the
heat
with
informality
.
Men
with
highly
*NL*
plastered
hair
,
so
painfully
shaved
that
their
faces
looked
sore
,
*NL*
removed
their
coats
,
sighed
,
and
unbuttoned
two
buttons
of
their
*NL*
uncreased
Sunday
vests
.
Large-bosomed
,
white-bloused
,
hot-necked
,
*NL*
spectacled
matrons
--
the
Mothers
in
Israel
,
pioneers
and
friends
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Champ
Perry
--
waved
their
palm-leaf
fans
in
a
steady
rhythm
.
Abashed
boys
*NL*
slunk
into
the
rear
pews
and
giggled
,
while
milky
little
girls
,
up
front
*NL*
with
their
mothers
,
self-consciously
kept
from
turning
around
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
church
was
half
barn
and
half
Gopher
Prairie
parlor
.
The
streaky
*NL*
brown
wallpaper
was
broken
in
its
dismal
sweep
only
by
framed
texts
,
*NL*
``
Come
unto
Me
''
and
``
The
Lord
is
My
Shepherd
,
''
by
a
list
of
hymns
,
and
by
*NL*
a
crimson
and
green
diagram
,
staggeringly
drawn
upon
hemp-colored
paper
,
*NL*
indicating
the
alarming
ease
with
which
a
young
man
may
descend
from
*NL*
Palaces
of
Pleasure
and
the
House
of
Pride
to
Eternal
Damnation
.
But
the
*NL*
varnished
oak
pews
and
the
new
red
carpet
and
the
three
large
chairs
on
*NL*
the
platform
,
behind
the
bare
reading-stand
,
were
all
of
a
rocking-chair
*NL*
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
civic
and
neighborly
and
commendable
today
.
She
beamed
and
*NL*
bowed
.
She
trolled
out
with
the
others
the
hymn
:
*NL*
*NL*
How
pleasant
't
is
on
Sabbath
morn
*NL*
To
gather
in
the
church
*NL*
And
there
I
'll
have
no
carnal
thoughts
,
*NL*
Nor
sin
shall
me
besmirch
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
rustle
of
starched
linen
skirts
and
stiff
shirt-fronts
,
the
*NL*
congregation
sat
down
,
and
gave
heed
to
the
Reverend
Mr.
Zitterel
.
The
*NL*
priest
was
a
thin
,
swart
,
intense
young
man
with
a
bang
.
He
wore
a
*NL*
black
sack
suit
and
a
lilac
tie
.
He
smote
the
enormous
Bible
on
the
*NL*
reading-stand
,
vociferated
,
``
Come
,
let
us
reason
together
,
''
delivered
a
*NL*
prayer
informing
Almighty
God
of
the
news
of
the
past
week
,
and
began
to
*NL*
reason
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
proved
that
the
only
problems
which
America
had
to
face
were
*NL*
Mormonism
and
Prohibition
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
let
any
of
these
self-conceited
fellows
that
are
always
trying
to
*NL*
stir
up
trouble
deceive
you
with
the
belief
that
there
's
anything
to
*NL*
all
these
smart-aleck
movements
to
let
the
unions
and
the
Farmers
'
*NL*
Nonpartisan
League
kill
all
our
initiative
and
enterprise
by
fixing
*NL*
wages
and
prices
.
There
is
n't
any
movement
that
amounts
to
a
whoop
*NL*
without
it
's
got
a
moral
background
.
And
let
me
tell
you
that
while
*NL*
folks
are
fussing
about
what
they
call
`
economics
'
and
`
socialism
'
*NL*
and
`
science
'
and
a
lot
of
things
that
are
nothing
in
the
world
but
a
*NL*
disguise
for
atheism
,
the
Old
Satan
is
busy
spreading
his
secret
net
*NL*
and
tentacles
out
there
in
Utah
,
under
his
guise
of
Joe
Smith
or
Brigham
*NL*
Young
or
whoever
their
leaders
happen
to
be
today
,
it
does
n't
make
any
*NL*
difference
,
and
they
're
making
game
of
the
Old
Bible
that
has
led
this
*NL*
American
people
through
its
manifold
trials
and
tribulations
to
its
firm
*NL*
position
as
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophecies
and
the
recognized
leader
*NL*
of
all
nations
.
`
Sit
thou
on
my
right
hand
till
I
make
thine
enemies
*NL*
the
footstool
of
my
feet
,
'
said
the
Lord
of
Hosts
,
Acts
II
,
the
*NL*
thirty-fourth
verse
--
and
let
me
tell
you
right
now
,
you
got
to
get
up
a
*NL*
good
deal
earlier
in
the
morning
than
you
get
up
even
when
you
're
going
*NL*
fishing
,
if
you
want
to
be
smarter
than
the
Lord
,
who
has
shown
us
the
*NL*
straight
and
narrow
way
,
and
he
that
passeth
therefrom
is
in
*NL*
eternal
peril
and
,
to
return
to
this
vital
and
terrible
subject
of
*NL*
Mormonism
--
and
as
I
say
,
it
is
terrible
to
realize
how
little
attention
*NL*
is
given
to
this
evil
right
here
in
our
midst
and
on
our
very
doorstep
,
*NL*
as
it
were
--
it
's
a
shame
and
a
disgrace
that
the
Congress
of
these
*NL*
United
States
spends
all
its
time
talking
about
inconsequential
*NL*
financial
matters
that
ought
to
be
left
to
the
Treasury
Department
,
as
I
*NL*
understand
it
,
instead
of
arising
in
their
might
and
passing
a
law
that
*NL*
any
one
admitting
he
is
a
Mormon
shall
simply
be
deported
and
as
it
were
*NL*
kicked
out
of
this
free
country
in
which
we
have
n't
got
any
room
for
*NL*
polygamy
and
the
tyrannies
of
Satan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
,
to
digress
for
a
moment
,
especially
as
there
are
more
of
them
in
*NL*
this
state
than
there
are
Mormons
,
though
you
never
can
tell
what
will
*NL*
happen
with
this
vain
generation
of
young
girls
,
that
think
more
about
*NL*
wearing
silk
stockings
than
about
minding
their
mothers
and
learning
to
*NL*
bake
a
good
loaf
of
bread
,
and
many
of
them
listening
to
these
sneaking
*NL*
Mormon
missionaries
--
and
I
actually
heard
one
of
them
talking
right
out
*NL*
on
a
street-corner
in
Duluth
,
a
few
years
ago
,
and
the
officers
of
the
*NL*
law
not
protesting
--
but
still
,
as
they
are
a
smaller
but
more
immediate
*NL*
problem
,
let
me
stop
for
just
a
moment
to
pay
my
respects
to
these
*NL*
Seventh-Day
Adventists
.
Not
that
they
are
immoral
,
I
do
n't
mean
,
but
*NL*
when
a
body
of
men
go
on
insisting
that
Saturday
is
the
Sabbath
,
after
*NL*
Christ
himself
has
clearly
indicated
the
new
dispensation
,
then
I
think
*NL*
the
legislature
ought
to
step
in
--

*NL*
*NL*
At
this
point
Carol
awoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
through
three
more
minutes
by
studying
the
face
of
a
girl
in
*NL*
the
pew
across
:
a
sensitive
unhappy
girl
whose
longing
poured
out
*NL*
with
intimidating
self-revelation
as
she
worshiped
Mr.
Zitterel
.
Carol
*NL*
wondered
who
the
girl
was
.
She
had
seen
her
at
church
suppers
.
She
*NL*
considered
how
many
of
the
three
thousand
people
in
the
town
she
did
not
*NL*
know
;
to
how
many
of
them
the
Thanatopsis
and
the
Jolly
Seventeen
were
*NL*
icy
social
peaks
;
how
many
of
them
might
be
toiling
through
boredom
*NL*
thicker
than
her
own
--
with
greater
courage
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
examined
her
nails
.
She
read
two
hymns
.
She
got
some
satisfaction
*NL*
out
of
rubbing
an
itching
knuckle
.
She
pillowed
on
her
shoulder
the
head
*NL*
of
the
baby
who
,
after
killing
time
in
the
same
manner
as
his
mother
,
*NL*
was
so
fortunate
as
to
fall
asleep
.
She
read
the
introduction
,
*NL*
title-page
,
and
acknowledgment
of
copyrights
,
in
the
hymnal
.
She
tried
*NL*
to
evolve
a
philosophy
which
would
explain
why
Kennicott
could
never
*NL*
tie
his
scarf
so
that
it
would
reach
the
top
of
the
gap
in
his
turn-down
*NL*
collar
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
no
other
diversions
to
be
found
in
the
pew
.
She
glanced
back
*NL*
at
the
congregation
.
She
thought
that
it
would
be
amiable
to
bow
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Champ
Perry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
slow
turning
head
stopped
,
galvanized
.
*NL*
*NL*
Across
the
aisle
,
two
rows
back
,
was
a
strange
young
man
who
shone
among
*NL*
the
cud-chewing
citizens
like
a
visitant
from
the
sun-amber
curls
,
low
*NL*
forehead
,
fine
nose
,
chin
smooth
but
not
raw
from
Sabbath
shaving
.
His
*NL*
lips
startled
her
.
The
lips
of
men
in
Gopher
Prairie
are
flat
in
the
*NL*
face
,
straight
and
grudging
.
The
stranger
's
mouth
was
arched
,
the
upper
*NL*
lip
short
.
He
wore
a
brown
jersey
coat
,
a
delft-blue
bow
,
a
white
silk
*NL*
shirt
,
white
flannel
trousers
.
He
suggested
the
ocean
beach
,
a
tennis
*NL*
court
,
anything
but
the
sun-blistered
utility
of
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
visitor
from
Minneapolis
,
here
for
business
?
No
.
He
was
n't
a
business
*NL*
man
.
He
was
a
poet
.
Keats
was
in
his
face
,
and
Shelley
,
and
Arthur
*NL*
Upson
,
whom
she
had
once
seen
in
Minneapolis
.
He
was
at
once
too
*NL*
sensitive
and
too
sophisticated
to
touch
business
as
she
knew
it
in
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
restrained
amusement
he
was
analyzing
the
noisy
Mr.
Zitterel
.
Carol
*NL*
was
ashamed
to
have
this
spy
from
the
Great
World
hear
the
pastor
's
*NL*
maundering
.
She
felt
responsible
for
the
town
.
She
resented
his
gaping
*NL*
at
their
private
rites
.
She
flushed
,
turned
away
.
But
she
continued
to
*NL*
feel
his
presence
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
could
she
meet
him
?
She
must
!
For
an
hour
of
talk
.
He
was
all
that
*NL*
she
was
hungry
for
.
She
could
not
let
him
get
away
without
a
word
--
and
*NL*
she
would
have
to
.
She
pictured
,
and
ridiculed
,
herself
as
walking
up
*NL*
to
him
and
remarking
,
``
I
am
sick
with
the
Village
Virus
.
Will
you
please
*NL*
tell
me
what
people
are
saying
and
playing
in
New
York
?
''
She
pictured
,
*NL*
and
groaned
over
,
the
expression
of
Kennicott
if
she
should
say
,
*NL*
``
Why
would
n't
it
be
reasonable
for
you
,
my
soul
,
to
ask
that
complete
*NL*
stranger
in
the
brown
jersey
coat
to
come
to
supper
tonight
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
brooded
,
not
looking
back
.
She
warned
herself
that
she
was
probably
*NL*
exaggerating
;
that
no
young
man
could
have
all
these
exalted
qualities
.
*NL*
Was
n't
he
too
obviously
smart
,
too
glossy-new
?
Like
a
movie
actor
.
*NL*
Probably
he
was
a
traveling
salesman
who
sang
tenor
and
fancied
himself
*NL*
in
imitations
of
Newport
clothes
and
spoke
of
``
the
swellest
business
*NL*
proposition
that
ever
came
down
the
pike
.
''
In
a
panic
she
peered
at
him
.
*NL*
No
!
This
was
no
hustling
salesman
,
this
boy
with
the
curving
Grecian
*NL*
lips
and
the
serious
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
rose
after
the
service
,
carefully
taking
Kennicott
's
arm
and
smiling
*NL*
at
him
in
a
mute
assertion
that
she
was
devoted
to
him
no
matter
what
*NL*
happened
.
She
followed
the
Mystery
's
soft
brown
jersey
shoulders
out
of
*NL*
the
church
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fatty
Hicks
,
the
shrill
and
puffy
son
of
Nat
,
flapped
his
hand
at
the
*NL*
beautiful
stranger
and
jeered
,
``
How
's
the
kid
?
All
dolled
up
like
a
*NL*
plush
horse
today
,
ai
n't
we
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
exceeding
sick
.
Her
herald
from
the
outside
was
Erik
Valborg
,
*NL*
``
Elizabeth
.
''
Apprentice
tailor
!
Gasoline
and
hot
goose
!
Mending
dirty
*NL*
jackets
!
Respectfully
holding
a
tape-measure
about
a
paunch
!
*NL*
*NL*
And
yet
,
she
insisted
,
this
boy
was
also
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
They
had
Sunday
dinner
with
the
Smails
,
in
a
dining-room
which
centered
*NL*
about
a
fruit
and
flower
piece
and
a
crayon-enlargement
of
Uncle
*NL*
Whittier
.
Carol
did
not
heed
Aunt
Bessie
's
fussing
in
regard
to
Mrs.
*NL*
Robert
B.
Schminke
's
bead
necklace
and
Whittier
's
error
in
putting
on
*NL*
the
striped
pants
,
day
like
this
.
She
did
not
taste
the
shreds
of
roast
*NL*
pork
.
She
said
vacuously
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Uh
--
Will
,
I
wonder
if
that
young
man
in
the
white
flannel
trousers
,
at
*NL*
church
this
morning
,
was
this
Valborg
person
that
they
're
all
talking
*NL*
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yump
.
That
's
him
.
Was
n't
that
the
darndest
get-up
he
had
on
!
''
Kennicott
*NL*
scratched
at
a
white
smear
on
his
hard
gray
sleeve
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
n't
so
bad
.
I
wonder
where
he
comes
from
?
He
seems
to
have
lived
*NL*
in
cities
a
good
deal
.
Is
he
from
the
East
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
East
?
Him
?
Why
,
he
comes
from
a
farm
right
up
north
here
,
just
this
*NL*
side
of
Jefferson
.
I
know
his
father
slightly
--
Adolph
Valborg
--
typical
*NL*
cranky
old
Swede
farmer
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
really
?
''
blandly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Believe
he
has
lived
in
Minneapolis
for
quite
some
time
,
though
.
*NL*
Learned
his
trade
there
.
And
I
will
say
he
's
bright
,
some
ways
.
Reads
*NL*
a
lot
.
Pollock
says
he
takes
more
books
out
of
the
library
than
anybody
*NL*
else
in
town
.
Huh
!
He
's
kind
of
like
you
in
that
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Smails
and
Kennicott
laughed
very
much
at
this
sly
jest
.
Uncle
*NL*
Whittier
seized
the
conversation
.
``
That
fellow
that

what
he
is

Makes
me
tired
to
see
a
young
fellow
that

ought
to
be
in
the
war
,
or
anyway
out
in
the
fields
earning
his
living
*NL*
honest

I
done

was
young

doing
a

then
come
*NL*
out

dress
up

*NL*
*NL*
Carol
reflected
that
the
carving-knife
would
make
an
excellent
dagger
*NL*
with
which
to
kill
Uncle
Whittier
.
It
would
slide
in
easily
.
The
*NL*
headlines
would
be
terrible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
said
judiciously
,
``
Oh
,
I
do
n't
want
to
be
unjust
to
him

*NL*
I
believe
he
took
his
physical
examination
for
military
service
.
Got
*NL*
varicose
veins
--
not
bad
,
but
enough
to
disqualify
him
.
Though
I
will
say
*NL*
he
does
n't
look
like
a
fellow
that
would
be
so
awful
darn
crazy
to
poke
*NL*
his
bayonet
into
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Looks
soft

And
they
say
he
told
Del
Snafflin
,
*NL*
when
he
was
getting
a
hair-cut
on
Saturday
,
that
he
wished
he
could
play

the
piano

*NL*
``
Is
n't
it
wonderful
how
much
we
all
know
about
one
another
in

like
this

said
Carol
innocently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
was
suspicious
,
but
Aunt
Bessie
,
serving
the
floating
island
*NL*
pudding
,
agreed
,
``
Yes
,
it
is
wonderful

Folks
can
get
away
with
all

sorts
of
meannesses

sins
in
these
terrible
cities
,
but
they
ca
n't
*NL*
here

I
was
noticing
this
tailor
fellow
this
morning
,
and
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Riggs
offered
to
share
her
hymn-book
with
him
,
he
shook
his
head
,
and
*NL*
all
the
while
we
was
singing
he
just
stood
there
like
a
bump
on
a
log
*NL*
and
never
opened
his
mouth
.
Everybody
says
he
's
got
an
idea
that
he
's
*NL*
got
so
much
better
manners

all
than
what
the
rest
of
us
have

if
*NL*
that
's
what
he
calls
good
manners

I
want
to
know

*NL*
Carol
again
studied
the
carving-knife

Blood
on
the
whiteness
of

might
be
gorgeous

*NL*
*NL*
Then
:

Boarding
with
the
Widow
Bogart
was
Fern
Mullins
,
a
girl
of
twenty-two
*NL*
who
was
to
be
teacher
of
English
,
French
,
and
gymnastics
in
the
high
*NL*
school
this
coming
session

Fern
Mullins
had
come
to
town
early
,
for
the
*NL*
six-weeks
normal
course
for
country
teachers
.
Carol
had
noticed
her
on
*NL*
the
street
,
had
heard
almost
as
much
about
her
as
about
Erik
Valborg
.
*NL*
She
was
tall
,
weedy
,
pretty
,
and
incurably
rakish
.
Whether
she
wore
a
*NL*
low
middy
collar
or
dressed
reticently
for
school
in
a
black
suit
with
a
*NL*
high-necked
blouse
,
she
was
airy
,
flippant
.
``
She
looks
like
an
absolute
*NL*
totty

said
all
the
Mrs.
Sam
Clarks
,
disapprovingly
,
and
all
the
*NL*
Juanita
Haydocks

enviously
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Sunday
evening
,
sitting
in
baggy
canvas
lawn-chairs
beside
the
*NL*
house
,
the
Kennicotts
saw
Fern
laughing
with
Cy
Bogart
who
,
though
still
*NL*
a
junior
in
high
school
,
was
now
a
lump
of
a
man
,
only
two
or
three
*NL*
years
younger
than
Fern
.
Cy
had
to
go
downtown
for
weighty
matters
*NL*
connected
with
the
pool-parlor
.
Fern
drooped
on
the
Bogart
porch
,
her
*NL*
chin
in
her
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
looks
lonely

''
said
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
does
,
poor
soul

I
believe
I
'll
go
over
and
speak
to
her

I
was
*NL*
introduced
to
her
at
Dave

but
I
have

Carol
was
slipping
*NL*
across
the
lawn
,
a
white
figure
in
the
dimness
,
faintly
brushing
the
*NL*
dewy
grass
.
She
was
thinking
of
Erik
and
of
the
fact
that
her
feet
*NL*
were
wet
,
and
she
was
casual
in
her
greeting
:
``
Hello

The
doctor

I
*NL*
wondered
if
you
were
lonely

*NL*
*NL*
Resentfully
,
``
I

*NL*
Carol
concentrated
on
her
.
``
My

you
sound
so
!
I
know
how
it
is

I
*NL*
used
to
be
tired
when
I
was
on
the
job
--
I
was
a
librarian
.
What
was
your
*NL*
college
?
I
was
Blodgett

''
*NL*
*NL*
More
interestedly
,
``
I
went
to
the

Fern
meant
the
University
of
*NL*
Minnesota
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
had

Blodgett
was
a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Where
were

challengingly

*NL*
*NL*
``
St.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Honest

Oh
dear
,
I
wish
I
was
back
in
the
Cities
!
This
is
my
first
year
*NL*
of
teaching
,
and
I
'm
scared
stiff
.
I
did
have
the
best
time
in
college
:
*NL*
dramatics
and
basket-ball
and
fussing
and
dancing
--
I
'm
simply
crazy
*NL*
about
dancing
.
And
here
,
except
when
I
have
the
kids
in
gymnasium
class
,
*NL*
or
when
I
'm
chaperoning
the
basket-ball
team
on
a
trip
out-of-town
,
I
*NL*
wo
n't
dare
to
move
above
a
whisper
.
I
guess
they
do
n't
care
much
if
*NL*
you
put
any
pep
into
teaching
or
not
,
as
long
as
you
look
like
a
Good
*NL*
Influence
out
of
school-hours
--
and
that
means
never
doing
anything
you
*NL*
want
to
.
This
normal
course
is
bad
enough
,
but
the
regular
school
will
*NL*
be
FIERCE
!
If
it
was
n't
too
late
to
get
a
job
in
the
Cities
,
I
swear
I
'd
*NL*
resign
here
.
I
bet
I
wo
n't
dare
to
go
to
a
single
dance
all
winter
.
If
*NL*
I
cut
loose
and
danced
the
way
I
like
to
,
they
'd
think
I
was
a
perfect
*NL*
hellion
--
poor
harmless
me
!
Oh
,
I
ought
n't
to
be
talking
like
this
.
Fern
,
*NL*
you
never
could
be
cagey
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
be
frightened

my
dear

Does
n't
that
sound
atrociously
old
*NL*
and
kind

I
'm
talking
to
you
the
way
Mrs.
Westlake
talks
to
me

That
's
*NL*
having
a
husband
and
a
kitchen
range

I
suppose

But
I
feel
young

and
I
*NL*
want
to
dance
like
a

like
a
hellion

too

So
I
sympathize

*NL*
*NL*
Fern
made
a
sound
of
gratitude
.
Carol
inquired
,
``
What
experience
did
you
*NL*
have

college
dramatics

I
tried
to
start

of

*NL*
Two
hours
later
,
when
Kennicott
came
over
to
greet
Fern
and
to
yawn
,
*NL*
``
Look
here

Carrie

suppose

better
be
thinking
about
*NL*
turning
in

've
got
a
hard
day
tomorrow

the
two
were
talking
so
*NL*
intimately
that
they
constantly
interrupted
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
went
respectably
home
,
convoyed
by
a
husband
,
and
decorously
*NL*
holding
up
her
skirts
,
Carol
rejoiced
,
``
Everything
has
changed
!
I
have
*NL*
two
friends

Fern
and

But
who
's
the
other

's
queer

I
thought

there
was

Oh

how
absurd

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
often
passed
Erik
Valborg
on
the
street
;
the
brown
jersey
coat
*NL*
became
unremarkable
.
When
she
was
driving
with
Kennicott
,
in
early
*NL*
evening
,
she
saw
him
on
the
lake
shore
,
reading
a
thin
book
which
might
*NL*
easily
have
been
poetry
.
She
noted
that
he
was
the
only
person
in
the
*NL*
motorized
town
who
still
took
long
walks
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
herself
that
she
was
the
daughter
of
a
judge
,
the
wife
of
a
*NL*
doctor
,
and
that
she
did
not
care
to
know
a
capering
tailor
.
She
told
*NL*
herself
that
she
was
not
responsive
to
men
...
not
even
to
Percy
*NL*
Bresnahan
.
She
told
herself
that
a
woman
of
thirty
who
heeded
a
boy
*NL*
of
twenty-five
was
ridiculous
.
And
on
Friday
,
when
she
had
convinced
*NL*
herself
that
the
errand
was
necessary
,
she
went
to
Nat
Hicks
's
shop
,
*NL*
bearing
the
not
very
romantic
burden
of
a
pair
of
her
husband
's
*NL*
trousers
.
Hicks
was
in
the
back
room
.
She
faced
the
Greek
god
who
,
in
a
*NL*
somewhat
ungodlike
way
,
was
stitching
a
coat
on
a
scaley
sewing-machine
,
*NL*
in
a
room
of
smutted
plaster
walls
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
that
his
hands
were
not
in
keeping
with
a
Hellenic
face
.
They
*NL*
were
thick
,
roughened
with
needle
and
hot
iron
and
plow-handle
.
Even
*NL*
in
the
shop
he
persisted
in
his
finery
.
He
wore
a
silk
shirt
,
a
topaz
*NL*
scarf
,
thin
tan
shoes
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
she
absorbed
while
she
was
saying
curtly
,
``
Can
I
get
these
pressed
,
*NL*
please
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Not
rising
from
the
sewing-machine
he
stuck
out
his
hand
,
mumbled
,
``
When
*NL*
do
you
want
them
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
Monday

*NL*
*NL*
The
adventure
was
over
.
She
was
marching
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
name
?
''
he
called
after
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
risen
and
,
despite
the
farcicality
of
Dr.
Will
Kennicott
's
bulgy
*NL*
trousers
draped
over
his
arm
,
he
had
the
grace
of
a
cat
.

*NL*
``

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``

She
stood
at

door

Now
that
she
had
carried
out
her
*NL*
preposterous
impulse
to
see
what
he
was
like

she
was
cold

familiarities

the
virtuous

always
wished

had

pronounced

rhymed

with

Carol
nodded
in
the
manner
of

being
kind
to
a
tradesman

one
*NL*
of
her
selves
sneered
,
``

was
appealing

get
up

dramatic
club

coming
fall

*NL*
``

might
be
worth
thinking

She
came
out
of
her
several
*NL*
conflicting
poses

and
said
sincerely
,
``

new
teacher

If

could
scrape
up
half
a

knew

But
to

he
was
not

He
shook
hands
loosely

*NL*
said
,
``

*NL*
Nat
Hicks
was
socially
acceptable
;
he
had
been
here
for
years
,
and
*NL*
owned
his
shop
;
but
this
person
was
merely
Nat
's
workman
,
and
the
*NL*
town
's
principle
of
perfect
democracy
was
not
meant
to
be
applied
*NL*
indiscriminately
.

The

theoretically
included
Kennicott

he
sat
back

patting
yawns

conscious
of
Fern

ankles

smiling
amiably
*NL*
on

children
at

Fern
wanted

tell
her
grievances

Carol
was
sulky

thought

it

Erik
who
made
suggestions

He
had
read
with
astounding
breadth
,
and
astounding
lack
of
judgment
.
*NL*
His
voice
was
sensitive
to
liquids
,
but
he
overused
the
word
``
glorious

*NL*
He
mispronounced
a
tenth
of
the
words
he
had
from
books
,
but
he
knew
it

*NL*
He
was
insistent
,

he
was
shy

When

sure
of
his
vision

CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
had
walked
up
the
railroad
track
with
Hugh
,
this
Sunday
afternoon
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
Erik
Valborg
coming
,
in
an
ancient
highwater
suit
,
tramping
*NL*
sullenly
and
alone
,
striking
at
the
rails
with
a
stick
.
For
a
second
*NL*
she
unreasoningly
wanted
to
avoid
him
,
but
she
kept
on
,
and
she
serenely
*NL*
talked
about
God
,
whose
voice
,
Hugh
asserted
,
made
the
humming
in
the
*NL*
telegraph
wires
.
Erik
stared
,
straightened
.
They
greeted
each
other
with
*NL*
``
Hello
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
,
say
how-do-you-do
to
Mr.
Valborg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
dear
me
,
he
's
got
a
button
unbuttoned
,
''
worried
Erik
,
kneeling
.
*NL*
Carol
frowned
,
then
noted
the
strength
with
which
he
swung
the
baby
in
*NL*
the
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
May
I
walk
along
a
piece
with
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
tired
.
Let
's
rest
on
those
ties
.
Then
I
must
be
trotting
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
sat
on
a
heap
of
discarded
railroad
ties
,
oak
logs
spotted
with
*NL*
cinnamon-colored
dry-rot
and
marked
with
metallic
brown
streaks
where
*NL*
iron
plates
had
rested
.
Hugh
learned
that
the
pile
was
the
hiding-place
*NL*
of
Injuns
;
he
went
gunning
for
them
while
the
elders
talked
of
*NL*
uninteresting
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
telegraph
wires
thrummed
,
thrummed
,
thrummed
above
them
;
the
rails
*NL*
were
glaring
hard
lines
;
the
goldenrod
smelled
dusty
.
Across
the
track
*NL*
was
a
pasture
of
dwarf
clover
and
sparse
lawn
cut
by
earthy
cow-paths
;
*NL*
beyond
its
placid
narrow
green
,
the
rough
immensity
of
new
stubble
,
*NL*
jagged
with
wheat-stacks
like
huge
pineapples
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
talked
of
books
;
flamed
like
a
recent
convert
to
any
faith
.
He
*NL*
exhibited
as
many
titles
and
authors
as
possible
,
halting
only
to
*NL*
appeal
,
``
Have
you
read
his
last
book
?
Do
n't
you
think
he
's
a
terribly
*NL*
strong
writer
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
dizzy
.
But
when
he
insisted
,
``
You
've
been
a
librarian
;
tell
*NL*
me
;
do
I
read
too
much
fiction
?
''
she
advised
him
loftily
,
rather
*NL*
discursively
.
He
had
,
she
indicated
,
never
studied
.
He
had
skipped
from
*NL*
one
emotion
to
another
.
Especially
--
she
hesitated
,
then
flung
it
at
*NL*
him
--
he
must
not
guess
at
pronunciations
;
he
must
endure
the
nuisance
of
*NL*
stopping
to
reach
for
the
dictionary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
talking
like
a
cranky
teacher
,
''
she
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
!
And
I
will
study
!
Read
the
damned
dictionary
right
through
.
''
He
*NL*
crossed
his
legs
and
bent
over
,
clutching
his
ankle
with
both
hands
.
``
I
*NL*
know
what
you
mean
.
I
've
been
rushing
from
picture
to
picture
,
like
a
*NL*
kid
let
loose
in
an
art
gallery
for
the
first
time
.
You
see
,
it
's
so
*NL*
awful
recent
that
I
've
found
there
was
a
world
--
well
,
a
world
where
*NL*
beautiful
things
counted
.
I
was
on
the
farm
till
I
was
nineteen
.
Dad
is
*NL*
a
good
farmer
,
but
nothing
else
.
Do
you
know
why
he
first
sent
me
off
to
*NL*
learn
tailoring
?
I
wanted
to
study
drawing
,
and
he
had
a
cousin
that
'd
*NL*
made
a
lot
of
money
tailoring
out
in
Dakota
,
and
he
said
tailoring
was
*NL*
a
lot
like
drawing
,
so
he
sent
me
down
to
a
punk
hole
called
Curlew
,
*NL*
to
work
in
a
tailor
shop
.
Up
to
that
time
I
'd
only
had
three
months
'
*NL*
schooling
a
year
--
walked
to
school
two
miles
,
through
snow
up
to
my
*NL*
knees
--
and
Dad
never
would
stand
for
my
having
a
single
book
except
*NL*
schoolbooks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
read
a
novel
till
I
got
`
Dorothy
Vernon
of
Haddon
Hall
'
out
*NL*
of
the
library
at
Curlew
.
I
thought
it
was
the
loveliest
thing
in
the
*NL*
world
!
Next
I
read
`
Barriers
Burned
Away
'
and
then
Pope
's
translation
of
*NL*
Homer
.
Some
combination
,
all
right
!
When
I
went
to
Minneapolis
,
just
*NL*
two
years
ago
,
I
guess
I
'd
read
pretty
much
everything
in
that
Curlew
*NL*
library
,
but
I
'd
never
heard
of
Rossetti
or
John
Sargent
or
Balzac
or
*NL*
Brahms
.
But
--
Yump
,
I
'll
study
.
Look
here
!
Shall
I
get
out
of
this
*NL*
tailoring
,
this
pressing
and
repairing
?

``
I
do
n't
see
why

should
spend

much
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
if
I
find

ca

After
fussing
around

in

I
'd
feel

He
shrugged
and
spread
his
*NL*
fingers
wide
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
humbled
by
his
humility
;
she
put
away
in
her
mind
,
to
take
out
*NL*
and
worry
over
later
,
a
speculation
as
to
whether
it
was
not
she
who
*NL*
was
naive
.
She
urged
,
``
What
if
you
do
have
to
go

Most

do

we
're
not

nothing

socks

*NL*
I
'd
demand
all
I
could
get

whether
I
finally
settled
down
to
designing

back

's
one
of
our
*NL*
favorite
American
myths
that
broad
plains
necessarily
make
broad
minds
,
*NL*
and
high
mountains
make
high
purpose
.
I
thought
that
myself
,
when
I
*NL*
first
came
to
the
prairie
.
`
Big
--
new
.
'
Oh
,
I
do
n't
want
to
deny
the
*NL*
prairie
future
.
It
will
be
magnificent
.
But
equally
I
'm
hanged
if
I
want
*NL*
to
be
bullied
by
it
,
go
to
war
on
behalf
of
Main
Street
,
be
bullied
and
*NL*
BULLIED
by
the
faith
that
the
future
is
already
here
in
the
present
,
and
*NL*
that
all
of
us
must
stay
and
worship
wheat-stacks
and
insist
that
*NL*
this
is
`
God
's
Country
'
--
and
never
,
of
course
,
do
anything
original
*NL*
or
gay-colored
that
would
help
to
make
that
future
!
Anyway
,
you
do
n't
*NL*
belong
here
.
Sam
Clark
and
Nat
Hicks
,
that
's
what
our
big
newness
has
*NL*
produced
.
Go
!
Before
it
's
too
late
,
as
it
has
been
for
--
for
some
of
us
.
*NL*
Young
man
,
go
East
and
grow
up
with
the
revolution
!
Then
perhaps
you
*NL*
may
come
back
and
tell
Sam
and
Nat
and
me
what
to
do
with
the
land
we
've
*NL*
been
clearing
--
if
we
'll
listen
--
if
we
do
n't
lynch
you
first
!

*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
reverently
.
She
could
hear
him
saying
,
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've
always
wanted
to
know
a
woman
who
would
talk
to
me
like
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hearing
was
faulty
.
He
was
saying
nothing
of
the
sort
.
He
was
*NL*
saying
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
are
n't
you
happy
with
your
husband
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
does
n't
care
for
the
`

innocent

part

you

does
he
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
Erik
,
you
must
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
First
you
tell
me
to
go
and
be
free

then
you
say
that

!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

But
you
must

You
must
be
more
impersonal

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
glowered
at
her
like
a
downy
young
owl
.
She
was
n't
sure
but
she
*NL*
thought
that
he
muttered
,
``
I
'm
damned
if
I
will
.
''
She
considered
with
*NL*
wholesome
fear
the
perils
of
meddling
with
other
people
's
destinies
,
and
*NL*
she
said
timidly
,
``
Had
n't
we
better
start
back
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
mused
,
``
You
're
younger
than
I
am
.
Your
lips
are
for
songs
about
*NL*
rivers
in
the
morning
and
lakes
at
twilight
.
I
do
n't
see
how
anybody
*NL*
could
ever
hurt
you
...
Yes
.
We
better
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
trudged
beside
her
,
his
eyes
averted
.
Hugh
experimentally
took
his
*NL*
thumb
.
He
looked
down
at
the
baby
seriously
.
He
burst
out
,
``
All
right
.
*NL*
I
'll
do
it
.
I
'll
stay
here
one
year
.
Save
.
Not
spend
so
much
money
on
*NL*
clothes
.
And
then
I
'll
go
East
,
to
art-school
.
Work
on
the
side-tailor
*NL*
shop
,
dressmaker

.
I
'll
learn
what
I
'm
good
for
:
designing
clothes
,
*NL*
stage-settings
,
illustrating
,
or
selling
collars
to
fat
men

All
*NL*
settled

He
peered
at
her
,
unsmiling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
you
stand
it
here
in
town
for
a
year

*NL*
*NL*
``
With
you
to
look
at
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
Please

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

never
notice

me
about

in
the
army

especially
the
old
warhorses
,
the
old
men
that
are
n't
going
*NL*
themselves
.
And
this
Bogart
boy
.
And
Mr.
Hicks
's
son
--
he
's
a
horrible
*NL*
brat
.
But
probably
he
's
licensed
to
say
what
he
thinks
about
his
*NL*
father

hired
man

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
beastly
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
in
town
.
They
passed
Aunt
Bessie
's
house
.
Aunt
Bessie
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
were
at
the
window
,
and
Carol
saw
that
they
were
staring
so
*NL*
intently
that
they
answered
her
wave
only
with
the
stiffly
raised
hands
*NL*
of
automatons
.
In
the
next
block
Mrs.
Dr.
Westlake
was
gaping
from
her
*NL*
porch
.
Carol
said
with
an
embarrassed
quaver
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
run
in
and
see
Mrs.
Westlake
.
I
'll
say
good-by
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
avoided
his
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Westlake
was
affable
.
Carol
felt
that
she
was
expected
to
explain
;
*NL*
and
while
she
was
mentally
asserting
that
she
'd
be
hanged
if
she
'd
*NL*
explain
,
she
was
explaining
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hugh
captured
that
Valborg
boy
up
the
track
.
They
became
such
good
*NL*
friends
.
And
I
talked
to
him
for
a
while
.
I
'd
heard
he
was
eccentric
,
*NL*
but
really
,
I
found
him
quite
intelligent
.
Crude
,
but
he
reads
--
reads
*NL*
almost
the
way
Dr.
Westlake
does
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
fine
.
Why
does
he
stick
here
in
town
?
What
's
this
I
hear
about
*NL*
his
being
interested
in
Myrtle
Cass
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
know
.
Is
he
?
I
'm
sure
he
is
n't
!
He
said
he
was
quite
lonely
!
*NL*
Besides

Myrtle
is
a
babe
in
arms

*NL*
*NL*
``
Twenty-one

she
's
a
day

``

going

do
any
hunting
this
fall

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
need
of
explaining
Erik
dragged
her
back
into
doubting
.
For
all
his
*NL*
ardent
reading
,
and
his
ardent
life
,
was
he
anything
but
a
small-town
*NL*
youth
bred
on
an
illiberal
farm
and
in
cheap
tailor
shops
?
He
had
rough
*NL*
hands
.
She
had
been
attracted
only
by
hands
that
were
fine
and
suave
,
*NL*
like
those
of
her
father
.
Delicate
hands
and
resolute
purpose
.
But
this
*NL*
boy
--
powerful
seamed
hands
and
flabby
will
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
not
appealing
weakness
like
his
,
but
sane
strength
that
will
*NL*
animate
the
Gopher
Prairies
.
Only
--
Does
that
mean
anything
?
Or
am
*NL*
I
echoing
Vida
?
The
world
has
always
let
`
strong
'
statesmen
and
*NL*
soldiers
--
the
men
with
strong
voices
--
take
control
,
and
what
have
the
*NL*
thundering
boobies
done
?
What
is
`
strength
'
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
classifying
of
people
!
I
suppose
tailors
differ
as
much
as
*NL*
burglars
or
kings
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Erik
frightened
me
when
he
turned
on
me
.
Of
course
he
did
n't
mean
*NL*
anything
,
but
I
must
n't
let
him
be
so
personal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Amazing
impertinence
!
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
did
n't
mean
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
His
hands
are
FIRM
.
I
wonder
if
sculptors
do
n't
have
thick
hands
,
too
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
Of
course
if
there
really
is
anything
I
can
do
to
HELP
the
boy
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Though
I
despise
these
people
who
interfere
.
He
must
be
independent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
n't
altogether
pleased
,
the
week
after
,
when
Erik
was
independent
*NL*
and
,
without
asking
for
her
inspiration
,
planned
the
tennis
tournament
.
*NL*
It
proved
that
he
had
learned
to
play
in
Minneapolis
;
that
,
next
to
*NL*
Juanita
Haydock
,
he
had
the
best
serve
in
town
.
Tennis
was
well
spoken
*NL*
of
in
Gopher
Prairie
and
almost
never
played
.
There
were
three
courts
:
*NL*
one
belonging
to
Harry
Haydock
,
one
to
the
cottages
at
the
lake
,
and
*NL*
one
,
a
rough
field
on
the
outskirts
,
laid
out
by
a
defunct
tennis
*NL*
association
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
had
been
seen
in
flannels
and
an
imitation
panama
hat
,
playing
on
*NL*
the
abandoned
court
with
Willis
Woodford
,
the
clerk
in
Stowbody
's
bank
.
*NL*
Suddenly
he
was
going
about
proposing
the
reorganization
of
the
tennis
*NL*
association
,
and
writing
names
in
a
fifteen-cent
note-book
bought
for
*NL*
the
purpose
at
Dyer
's
.
When
he
came
to
Carol
he
was
so
excited
over
*NL*
being
an
organizer
that
he
did
not
stop
to
talk
of
himself
and
Aubrey
*NL*
Beardsley
for
more
than
ten
minutes
.
He
begged
,
``
Will
you
get
some
of
*NL*
the
folks
to
come
in
?
''
and
she
nodded
agreeably
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
proposed
an
informal
exhibition
match
to
advertise
the
association
;
*NL*
he
suggested
that
Carol
and
himself
,
the
Haydocks
,
the
Woodfords
,
and
*NL*
the
Dillons
play
doubles
,
and
that
the
association
be
formed
from
*NL*
the
gathered
enthusiasts
.
He
had
asked
Harry
Haydock
to
be
tentative
*NL*
president
.
Harry
,
he
reported
,
had
promised
,
``
All
right
.
You
bet
.
But
*NL*
you
go
ahead
and
arrange
things
,
and
I
'll
O.K.
'em
.
''
Erik
planned
that
*NL*
the
match
should
be
held
Saturday
afternoon
,
on
the
old
public
court
*NL*
at
the
edge
of
town
.
He
was
happy
in
being
,
for
the
first
time
,
part
of
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
the
week
Carol
heard
how
select
an
attendance
there
was
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
growled
that
he
did
n't
care
to
go
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
any
objections
to
her
playing
with
Erik
?
*NL*
*NL*
No
;
sure
not
;
she
needed
the
exercise
.
Carol
went
to
the
match
early
.
*NL*
The
court
was
in
a
meadow
out
on
the
New
Antonia
road
.
Only
Erik
was
*NL*
there
.
He
was
dashing
about
with
a
rake
,
trying
to
make
the
court
*NL*
somewhat
less
like
a
plowed
field
.
He
admitted
that
he
had
stage
fright
*NL*
at
the
thought
of
the
coming
horde
.
Willis
and
Mrs.
Woodford
arrived
,
*NL*
Willis
in
home-made
knickers
and
black
sneakers
through
at
the
toe
;
*NL*
then
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Harvey
Dillon
,
people
as
harmless
and
grateful
as
the
*NL*
Woodfords
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
embarrassed
and
excessively
agreeable
,
like
the
bishop
's
lady
*NL*
trying
not
to
feel
out
of
place
at
a
Baptist
bazaar
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
waited
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
match
was
scheduled
for
three
.
As
spectators
there
assembled
one
*NL*
youthful
grocery
clerk
,
stopping
his
Ford
delivery
wagon
to
stare
from
*NL*
the
seat
,
and
one
solemn
small
boy
,
tugging
a
smaller
sister
who
had
a
*NL*
careless
nose
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wonder
where
the
Haydocks
are
?
They
ought
to
show
up
,
at
least
,
''
said
*NL*
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
smiled
confidently
at
him
,
and
peered
down
the
empty
road
toward
*NL*
town
.
Only
heat-waves
and
dust
and
dusty
weeds
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
half-past
three
no
one
had
come
,
and
the
grocery
boy
reluctantly
got
*NL*
out
,
cranked
his
Ford
,
glared
at
them
in
a
disillusioned
manner
,
and
*NL*
rattled
away
.
The
small
boy
and
his
sister
ate
grass
and
sighed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
players
pretended
to
be
exhilarated
by
practising
service
,
but
they
*NL*
startled
at
each
dust-cloud
from
a
motor
car
.
None
of
the
cars
turned
*NL*
into
the
meadow-none
till
a
quarter
to
four
,
when
Kennicott
drove
in
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
's
heart
swelled
.
``
How
loyal
he
is
!
Depend
on
him
!
He
'd
come
,
*NL*
if
nobody
else
did
.
Even
though
he
does
n't
care
for
the
game
.
The
old
*NL*
darling
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
did
not
alight
.
He
called
out
,
``
Carrie
!
Harry
Haydock
`
phoned
*NL*
me
that
they
've
decided
to
hold
the
tennis
matches
,
or
whatever
you
call
*NL*
'em
,
down
at
the
cottages
at
the
lake
,
instead
of
here
.
The
bunch
are
*NL*
down
there
now
:
Haydocks
and
Dyers
and
Clarks
and
everybody
.
Harry
*NL*
wanted
to
know
if
I
'd
bring
you
down
.
I
guess
I
can
take
the
time
--
come
*NL*
right
back
after
supper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
Carol
could
sum
it
all
up
,
Erik
stammered
,
``
Why
,
Haydock
did
n't
*NL*
say
anything
to
me
about
the
change
.
Of
course
he
's
the
president
,
*NL*
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
looked
at
him
heavily
,
and
grunted
,
``
I
do
n't
know
a
thing
*NL*
about
it
...
Coming
,
Carrie
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
!
The
match
was
to
be
here
,
and
it
will
be
here
!
You
can
tell
*NL*
Harry
Haydock
that
he
's
beastly
rude
!
''
She
rallied
the
five
who
had
*NL*
been
left
out
,
who
would
always
be
left
out
.
``
Come
on
!
We
'll
toss
to
*NL*
see
which
four
of
us
play
the
Only
and
Original
First
Annual
Tennis
*NL*
Tournament
of
Forest
Hills

Del

,
and
Gopher
Prairie

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
as
I
blame
you
,
''
said
Kennicott
.
``
Well
have
supper
at
home
*NL*
then
?
''
He
drove
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
hated
him
for
his
composure
.
He
had
ruined
her
defiance
.
She
felt
*NL*
much
less
like
Susan
B.
Anthony
as
she
turned
to
her
huddled
followers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dillon
and
Willis
Woodford
lost
the
toss
.
The
others
played
out
*NL*
the
game
,
slowly
,
painfully
,
stumbling
on
the
rough
earth
,
muffing
the
*NL*
easiest
shots
,
watched
only
by
the
small
boy
and
his
sniveling
sister
.
*NL*
Beyond
the
court
stretched
the
eternal
stubble-fields
.
The
four
*NL*
marionettes
,
awkwardly
going
through
exercises

insignificant
in
the
hot
*NL*
sweep
of
contemptuous
land
,
were
not
heroic
;
their
voices
did
not
ring
*NL*
out
in
the
score
,
but
sounded
apologetic
;
and
when
the
game
was
over
*NL*
they
glanced
about
as
though
they
were
waiting
to
be
laughed
at
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
walked
home
.
Carol
took
Erik
's
arm
.
Through
her
thin
linen
sleeve
*NL*
she
could
feel
the
crumply
warmth
of
his
familiar
brown
jersey
coat
.
She
*NL*
observed
that
there
were
purple
and
red
gold
threads
interwoven
with
the
*NL*
brown
.
She
remembered
the
first
time
she
had
seen
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
talk
was
nothing
but
improvisations
on
the
theme
:
``
I
never
did
*NL*
like
this
Haydock
.
He
just
considers
his
own
convenience
.
''
Ahead
*NL*
of
them
,
the
Dillons
and
Woodfords
spoke
of
the
weather
and
B.
J.
*NL*
Gougerling
's
new
bungalow
.
No
one
referred
to
their
tennis
tournament
.
*NL*
At
her
gate
Carol
shook
hands
firmly
with
Erik
and
smiled
at
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Next
morning
,
Sunday
morning
,
when
Carol
was
on
the
porch
,
the
Haydocks
*NL*
drove
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
did
n't
mean
to
be
rude
to
you
,
dearie
!
''
implored
Juanita
.
``
I
*NL*
would
n't
have
you
think
that
for
anything
.
We
planned
that
Will
and
you
*NL*
should
come
down
and
have
supper
at
our
cottage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
I
'm
sure
you
did
n't
mean
to
be

Carol
was
super-neighborly
.
``
But
*NL*
I
do
think
you
ought
to
apologize
to
poor
Erik
Valborg
.
He
was
terribly
*NL*
hurt

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
.
Valborg
.
I
do
n't
care
so
much
what
he
thinks
,
''
objected
Harry
.
*NL*
``
He
's
nothing
but
a
conceited
buttinsky
.
Juanita
and
I
kind
of
figured
*NL*
he
was
trying
to
run
this
tennis
thing
too
darn
much
anyway
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
asked
him
to
make
arrangements

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
,
but
I
do
n't
like
him

Good
Lord
,
you
could
n't
hurt
his
*NL*
feelings
!
He
dresses
up
like
a
chorus
man
--
and
,
by
golly
,
he
looks
like
*NL*
one
!
--
but
he
's
nothing
but
a
Swede
farm
boy
,
and
these
foreigners
,
they
*NL*
all
got
hides
like
a
covey
of
rhinoceroses

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
he
IS
hurt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
--
I
do
n't
suppose
I
ought
to
have
gone
off
half-cocked

him
along

I
'll
give
him
a
cigar

''
*NL*
*NL*
Juanita
had
been
licking
her
lips
and
staring
at
Carol
.
She
interrupted
*NL*
her
husband
,
``
Yes
,
I
do
think
Harry
ought
to
fix
it
up
with
him
.
You
*NL*
LIKE
him
,
DO
N'T
you
,
Carol
??
''
*NL*
*NL*
Over
and
through
Carol
ran
a
frightened
cautiousness
.
``
Like
him
?
I
*NL*
have
n't
an
i-dea
.
He
seems
to
be
a
very
decent
young
man
.
I
just
felt
*NL*
that
when
he
'd
worked
so
hard
on
the
plans
for
the
match
,
it
was
a
shame
*NL*
not
to
be
nice
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
there
's
something
to
that
,
''
mumbled
Harry
;
then
,
at
sight
of
*NL*
Kennicott
coming
round
the
corner
tugging
the
red
garden
hose
by
its
*NL*
brass
nozzle
,
he
roared
in
relief
,
``
What
d'
you
think
you
're
trying
to
*NL*
do
,
doc
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
Kennicott
explained
in
detail
all
that
he
thought
he
was
trying
*NL*
to
do
,
while
he
rubbed
his
chin
and
gravely
stated
,
``
Struck
me
the
grass
*NL*
was
looking
kind
of
brown
in
patches
--
did
n't
know
but
what
I
'd
give
it
*NL*
a
sprinkling
,
''
and
while
Harry
agreed
that
this
was
an
excellent
*NL*
idea
,
Juanita
made
friendly
noises
and
,
behind
the
gilt
screen
of
an
*NL*
affectionate
smile
,
watched
Carol
's
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
wanted
to
see
Erik
.
She
wanted
some
one
to
play
with
!
There
was
n't
*NL*
even
so
dignified
and
sound
an
excuse
as
having
Kennicott
's
trousers
*NL*
pressed
;
when
she
inspected
them
,
all
three
pairs
looked
discouragingly
*NL*
neat
.
She
probably
would
not
have
ventured
on
it
had
she
not
spied
Nat
*NL*
Hicks
in
the
pool-parlor
,
being
witty
over
bottle-pool
.
Erik
was
alone
!
*NL*
She
fluttered
toward
the
tailor
shop
,
dashed
into
its
slovenly
heat
*NL*
with
the
comic
fastidiousness
of
a
humming
bird
dipping
into
a
dry
*NL*
tiger-lily
.
It
was
after
she
had
entered
that
she
found
an
excuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
was
in
the
back
room
,
cross-legged
on
a
long
table
,
sewing
a
vest
.
*NL*
But
he
looked
as
though
he
were
doing
this
eccentric
thing
to
amuse
*NL*
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Hello
.
I
wonder
if
you
could
n't
plan
a
sports-suit
for
me
?
''
she
said
*NL*
breathlessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
stared
at
her
;
he
protested
,
``
No
,
I
wo
n't
!
God
!
I
'm
not
going
to
be
a
*NL*
tailor
with
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Erik
!
''
she
said
,
like
a
mildly
shocked
mother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
occurred
to
her
that
she
did
not
need
a
suit
,
and
that
the
order
*NL*
might
have
been
hard
to
explain
to
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
swung
down
from
the
table
.
``
I
want
to
show
you
something
.
''
He
*NL*
rummaged
in
the
roll-top
desk
on
which
Nat
Hicks
kept
bills
,
buttons
,
*NL*
calendars
,
buckles
,
thread-channeled
wax
,
shotgun
shells
,
samples
of
*NL*
brocade
for
``
fancy
vests
,
''
fishing-reels
,
pornographic
post-cards
,
*NL*
shreds
of
buckram
lining
.
He
pulled
out
a
blurred
sheet
of
Bristol
board
*NL*
and
anxiously
gave
it
to
her
.
It
was
a
sketch
for
a
frock
.
It
was
not
*NL*
well
drawn
;
it
was
too
finicking
;
the
pillars
in
the
background
were
*NL*
grotesquely
squat
.
But
the
frock
had
an
original
back
,
very
low
,
with
*NL*
a
central
triangular
section
from
the
waist
to
a
string
of
jet
beads
at
*NL*
the
neck
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
stunning
.
But
how
it
would
shock
Mrs.
Clark
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
would
n't
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
let
yourself
go
more
when
you
're
drawing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
n't
know
if
I
can
.
I
've
started
kind
of
late
.
But
listen
!
What
do
you
*NL*
think
I
've
done
this
two
weeks
?
I
've
read
almost
clear
through
a
Latin
*NL*
grammar
,
and
about
twenty
pages
of
Caesar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Splendid
!
You
are
lucky
.
You
have
n't
a
teacher
to
make
you
artificial
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're
my
teacher
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
dangerous
edge
of
personality
to
his
voice
.
She
was
offended
*NL*
and
agitated
.
She
turned
her
shoulder
on
him
,
stared
through
the
back
*NL*
window
,
studying
this
typical
center
of
a
typical
Main
Street
block
,
*NL*
a
vista
hidden
from
casual
strollers
.
The
backs
of
the
chief
*NL*
establishments
in
town
surrounded
a
quadrangle
neglected
,
dirty
,
and
*NL*
incomparably
dismal
.
From
the
front
,
Howland
&
Gould
's
grocery
was
smug
*NL*
enough
,
but
attached
to
the
rear
was
a
lean-to
of
storm
streaked
pine
*NL*
lumber
with
a
sanded
tar
roof
--
a
staggering
doubtful
shed
behind
which
*NL*
was
a
heap
of
ashes
,
splintered
packing-boxes
,
shreds
of
excelsior
,
*NL*
crumpled
straw-board
,
broken
olive-bottles
,
rotten
fruit
,
and
utterly
*NL*
disintegrated
vegetables
:
orange
carrots
turning
black
,
and
potatoes
*NL*
with
ulcers
.
The
rear
of
the
Bon
Ton
Store
was
grim
with
blistered
*NL*
black-painted
iron
shutters
,
under
them
a
pile
of
once
glossy
red
*NL*
shirt-boxes
,
now
a
pulp
from
recent
rain
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
seen
from
Main
Street
,
Oleson
&
McGuire
's
Meat
Market
had
a
sanitary
*NL*
and
virtuous
expression
with
its
new
tile
counter
,
fresh
sawdust
on
the
*NL*
floor
,
and
a
hanging
veal
cut
in
rosettes
.
But
she
now
viewed
a
back
*NL*
room
with
a
homemade
refrigerator
of
yellow
smeared
with
black
grease
.
*NL*
A
man
in
an
apron
spotted
with
dry
blood
was
hoisting
out
a
hard
slab
of
*NL*
meat
.
*NL*
*NL*
Behind
Billy
's
Lunch
,
the
cook
,
in
an
apron
which
must
long
ago
have
*NL*
been
white
,
smoked
a
pipe
and
spat
at
the
pest
of
sticky
flies
.
In
the
*NL*
center
of
the
block
,
by
itself
,
was
the
stable
for
the
three
horses
of
*NL*
the
drayman
,
and
beside
it
a
pile
of
manure
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
rear
of
Ezra
Stowbody
's
bank
was
whitewashed
,
and
back
of
it
was
*NL*
a
concrete
walk
and
a
three-foot
square
of
grass
,
but
the
window
was
*NL*
barred
,
and
behind
the
bars
she
saw
Willis
Woodford
cramped
over
figures
*NL*
in
pompous
books
.
He
raised
his
head
,
jerkily
rubbed
his
eyes
,
and
went
*NL*
back
to
the
eternity
of
figures
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
backs
of
the
other
shops
were
an
impressionistic
picture
of
dirty
*NL*
grays
,
drained
browns
,
writhing
heaps
of
refuse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mine
is
a
back-yard
romance
--
with
a
journeyman
tailor
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
saved
from
self-pity
as
she
began
to
think
through
Erik
's
mind
.
*NL*
She
turned
to
him
with
an
indignant
,
``
It
's
disgusting
that
this
is
all
*NL*
you
have
to
look
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
considered
it
.
``
Outside
there
?
I
do
n't
notice
much
.
I
'm
learning
to
*NL*
look
inside
.
Not
awful
easy
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
I
must
be
hurrying
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
walked
home
--
without
hurrying
--
she
remembered
her
father
saying
*NL*
to
a
serious
ten-year-old
Carol
,
``
Lady
,
only
a
fool
thinks
he
's
superior
*NL*
to
beautiful
bindings
,
but
only
a
double-distilled
fool
reads
nothing
*NL*
but
bindings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
startled
by
the
return
of
her
father
,
startled
by
a
sudden
*NL*
conviction
that
in
this
flaxen
boy
she
had
found
the
gray
reticent
judge
*NL*
who
was
divine
love
,
perfect
under-standing
.
She
debated
it
,
furiously
*NL*
denied
it
,
reaffirmed
it
,
ridiculed
it
.
Of
one
thing
she
was
unhappily
*NL*
certain
:
there
was
nothing
of
the
beloved
father
image
in
Will
*NL*
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
why
she
sang
so
often
,
and
why
she
found
so
many
pleasant
*NL*
things
--
lamplight
seen
though
trees
on
a
cool
evening
,
sunshine
on
brown
*NL*
wood
,
morning
sparrows
,
black
sloping
roofs
turned
to
plates
of
silver
*NL*
by
moonlight
.
Pleasant
things
,
small
friendly
things
,
and
pleasant
*NL*
places
--
a
field
of
goldenrod
,
a
pasture
by
the
creek
--
and
suddenly
*NL*
a
wealth
of
pleasant
people
.
Vida
was
lenient
to
Carol
at
the
*NL*
surgical-dressing
class
;
Mrs.
Dave
Dyer
flattered
her
with
questions
*NL*
about
her
health
,
baby
,
cook
,
and
opinions
on
the
war
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Dyer
seemed
not
to
share
the
town
's
prejudice
against
Erik
.
``
He
's
*NL*
a
nice-looking
fellow
;
we
must
have
him
go
on
one
of
our
picnics
some
*NL*
time
.
''
Unexpectedly
,
Dave
Dyer
also
liked
him
.
The
tight-fisted
little
*NL*
farceur
had
a
confused
reverence
for
anything
that
seemed
to
him
refined
*NL*
or
clever
.
He
answered
Harry
Haydock
's
sneers
,
``
That
's
all
right
now
!
*NL*
Elizabeth
may
doll
himself
up
too
much
,
but
he
's
smart
,
and
do
n't
you
*NL*
forget
it
!
I
was
asking
round
trying
to
find
out
where
this
Ukraine
is
,
*NL*
and
darn
if
he
did
n't
tell
me
.
What
's
the
matter
with
his
talking
so
*NL*
polite
?
Hell
's
bells
,
Harry
,
no
harm
in
being
polite
.
There
's
some
*NL*
regular
he-men
that
are
just
as
polite
as
women
,
prett

near
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
found
herself
going
about
rejoicing
,
``
How
neighborly
the
town
is
!
''
*NL*
She
drew
up
with
a
dismayed
``
Am
I
falling
in
love
with
this
boy
?
That
's
*NL*
ridiculous
!
I
'm
merely
interested
in
him
.
I
like
to
think
of
helping
him
*NL*
to
succeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
she
dusted
the
living-room
,
mended
a
collar-band
,
bathed
Hugh
,
*NL*
she
was
picturing
herself
and
a
young
artistan
Apollo
nameless
and
*NL*
evasive
--
building
a
house
in
the
Berkshires
or
in
Virginia
;
exuberantly
*NL*
buying
a
chair
with
his
first
check
;
reading
poetry
together
,
and
*NL*
frequently
being
earnest
over
valuable
statistics
about
labor
;
tumbling
*NL*
out
of
bed
early
for
a
Sunday
walk
,
and
chattering
-LRB-
where
Kennicott
*NL*
would
have
yawned
-RRB-
over
bread
and
butter
by
a
lake
.
Hugh
was
in
her
*NL*
pictures
,
and
he
adored
the
young
artist
,
who
made
castles
of
chairs
and
*NL*
rugs
for
him
.
Beyond
these
playtimes
she
saw
the
``
things
I
could
do
for
*NL*
Erik
''
--
and
she
admitted
that
Erik
did
partly
make
up
the
image
of
her
*NL*
altogether
perfect
artist
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
panic
she
insisted
on
being
attentive
to
Kennicott
,
when
he
wanted
to
*NL*
be
left
alone
to
read
the
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VI
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
needed
new
clothes
.
Kennicott
had
promised
,
``
We
'll
have
a
good
trip
*NL*
down
to
the
Cities
in
the
fall
,
and
take
plenty
of
time
for
it
,
and
you
*NL*
can
get
your
new
glad-rags
then
.
''
But
as
she
examined
her
wardrobe
she
*NL*
flung
her
ancient
black
velvet
frock
on
the
floor
and
raged
,
``
They
're
*NL*
disgraceful
.
Everything
I
have
is
falling
to
pieces
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
new
dressmaker
and
milliner
,
a
Mrs.
Swiftwaite
.
It
was
*NL*
said
that
she
was
not
altogether
an
elevating
influence
in
the
way
she
*NL*
glanced
at
men
;
that
she
would
as
soon
take
away
a
legally
appropriated
*NL*
husband
as
not
;
that
if
there
WAS
any
Mr.
Swiftwaite
,
``
it
certainly
was
*NL*
strange
that
nobody
seemed
to
know
anything
about
him
!
''
But
she
had
made
*NL*
for
Rita
Gould
an
organdy
frock
and
hat
to
match
universally
admitted
*NL*
to
be
``
too
cunning
for
words
,
''
and
the
matrons
went
cautiously
,
*NL*
with
darting
eyes
and
excessive
politeness
,
to
the
rooms
which
Mrs.
*NL*
Swiftwaite
had
taken
in
the
old
Luke
Dawson
house
,
on
Floral
Avenue
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
none
of
the
spiritual
preparation
which
normally
precedes
the
*NL*
buying
of
new
clothes
in
Gopher
Prairie
,
Carol
marched
into
Mrs.
*NL*
Swiftwaite
's
,
and
demanded
,
``
I
want
to
see
a
hat
,
and
possibly
a
*NL*
blouse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
dingy
old
front
parlor
which
she
had
tried
to
make
smart
with
a
*NL*
pier
glass
,
covers
from
fashion
magazines
,
anemic
French
prints
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Swiftwaite
moved
smoothly
among
the
dress-dummies
and
hat-rests
,
spoke
*NL*
smoothly
as
she
took
up
a
small
black
and
red
turban
.
``
I
am
sure
the
*NL*
lady
will
find
this
extremely
attractive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
dreadfully
tabby
and
small-towny
,
''
thought
Carol
,
while
she
*NL*
soothed
,
``
I
do
n't
believe
it
quite
goes
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
the
choicest
thing
I
have
,
and
I
'm
sure
you
'll
find
it
suits
you
*NL*
beautifully
.
It
has
a
great
deal
of
chic
.
Please
try
it
on
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Swiftwaite
,
more
smoothly
than
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
studied
the
woman
.
She
was
as
imitative
as
a
glass
diamond
.
She
*NL*
was
the
more
rustic
in
her
effort
to
appear
urban
.
She
wore
a
severe
*NL*
high-collared
blouse
with
a
row
of
small
black
buttons
,
which
*NL*
was
becoming
to
her
low-breasted
slim
neatness
,
but
her
skirt
was
*NL*
hysterically
checkered
,
her
cheeks
were
too
highly
rouged
,
her
lips
too
*NL*
sharply
penciled
.
She
was
magnificently
a
specimen
of
the
illiterate
*NL*
divorcee
of
forty
made
up
to
look
thirty
,
clever
,
and
alluring
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
she
was
trying
on
the
hat
Carol
felt
very
condescending
.
She
took
*NL*
it
off
,
shook
her
head
,
explained
with
the
kind
smile
for
inferiors
,
*NL*
``
I
'm
afraid
it
wo
n't
do
,
though
it
's
unusually
nice
for
so
small
a
town
*NL*
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
it
's
really
absolutely
New-Yorkish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
it
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
,
I
know
my
New
York
styles

I
lived
in
New
York
for
years
,
*NL*
besides
almost
a
year
in
Akron
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
?
''
Carol
was
polite
,
and
edged
away
,
and
went
home
unhappily
.
*NL*
She
was
wondering
whether
her
own
airs
were
as
laughable
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Swiftwaite
's
.
She
put
on
the
eye-glasses
which
Kennicott
had
recently
*NL*
given
to
her
for
reading
,
and
looked
over
a
grocery
bill
.
She
*NL*
went
hastily
up
to
her
room
,
to
her
mirror
.
She
was
in
a
mood
of
*NL*
self-depreciation
.
Accurately
or
not
,
this
was
the
picture
she
saw
in
*NL*
the
mirror
:
*NL*
*NL*
Neat
rimless
eye-glasses
.
Black
hair
clumsily
tucked
under
a
mauve
straw
*NL*
hat
which
would
have
suited
a
spinster
.
Cheeks
clear
,
bloodless
.
Thin
*NL*
nose
.
Gentle
mouth
and
chin
.
A
modest
voile
blouse
with
an
edging
of
*NL*
lace
at
the
neck
.
A
virginal
sweetness
and
timorousness
--
no
flare
of
*NL*
gaiety
,
no
suggestion
of
cities
,
music
,
quick
laughter
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
become
a
small-town
woman

Absolute

The

the
village
*NL*

My
hair
--
just
scrambled
together

What
can
Erik
see
in
*NL*
that
wedded
spinster
there
?
He
does
like
me
!
Because
I
'm
the
only
woman

's
decent
to
him

How
long
before
he
'll
wake
up

up

*NL*

Not

*NL*
*NL*
She
seized
the
rouge
sponge
,
daubed
her
cheeks
,
scratched
at
her
lips
*NL*
with
the
vermilion
pencil
until
they
stung
,
tore
open
her
collar
.
She
*NL*
posed
with
her
thin
arms
in
the
attitude
of
the
fandango
.
She
dropped
*NL*
them
sharply
.
She
shook
her
head
.
``
My
heart
does
n't
dance

''
she
said
.
*NL*
She
flushed
as
she
fastened
her
blouse
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
At

graceful

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
FERN
Mullins
rushed
into
the
house
on
a
Saturday
morning
early
in
*NL*
September
and
shrieked
at
Carol
,
``
School
starts
next
Tuesday
.
I
've
got
*NL*
to
have
one
more
spree
before
I
'm
arrested
.
Let
's
get
up
a
picnic
down
*NL*
the
lake
for
this
afternoon
.
Wo
n't
you
come
,
Mrs.
Kennicott
,
and
the
*NL*
doctor
?
Cy
Bogart
wants
to
go
--
he
's
a
brat
but
he
's
lively
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
the
doctor
can
go
,
''
sedately
.
``
He
said
something
about
*NL*
having
to
make
a
country
call
this
afternoon
.
But
I
'd
love
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
dandy
!
Who
can
we
get
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mrs.
Dyer
might
be
chaperon
.
She
's
been
so
nice
.
And
maybe
Dave
,
if
he
*NL*
could
get
away
from
the
store
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
about
Erik
Valborg
?
I
think
he
's
got
lots
more
style
than
these
*NL*
town
boys
.
You
like
him
all
right
,
do
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
the
picnic
of
Carol
,
Fern
,
Erik
,
Cy
Bogart
,
and
the
Dyers
was
not
*NL*
only
moral
but
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
drove
to
the
birch
grove
on
the
south
shore
of
Lake
Minniemashie
.
*NL*
Dave
Dyer
was
his
most
clownish
self
.
He
yelped
,
jigged
,
wore
Carol
's
*NL*
hat
,
dropped
an
ant
down
Fern
's
back
,
and
when
they
went
swimming
-LRB-
the
*NL*
women
modestly
changing
in
the
car
with
the
side
curtains
up
,
the
men
*NL*
undressing
behind
the
bushes
,
constantly
repeating
,
``
Gee
,
hope
we
do
n't
*NL*
run
into
poison
ivy
''
-RRB-
,
Dave
splashed
water
on
them
and
dived
to
clutch
*NL*
his
wife
's
ankle
.
He
infected
the
others
.
Erik
gave
an
imitation
of
*NL*
the
Greek
dancers
he
had
seen
in
vaudeville
,
and
when
they
sat
down
to
*NL*
picnic
supper
spread
on
a
lap-robe
on
the
grass
,
Cy
climbed
a
tree
to
*NL*
throw
acorns
at
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
Carol
could
not
frolic
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
herself
young
,
with
parted
hair
,
sailor
blouse
and
large
*NL*
blue
bow
,
white
canvas
shoes
and
short
linen
skirt
.
Her
mirror
had
*NL*
asserted
that
she
looked
exactly
as
she
had
in
college
,
that
her
throat
*NL*
was
smooth
,
her
collar-bone
not
very
noticeable
.
But
she
was
under
*NL*
restraint
.
When
they
swam
she
enjoyed
the
freshness
of
the
water
but
*NL*
she
was
irritated
by
Cy
's
tricks
,
by
Dave
's
excessive
good
spirits
.
She
*NL*
admired
Erik
's
dance
;
he
could
never
betray
bad
taste
,
as
Cy
did
,
*NL*
and
Dave
.
She
waited
for
him
to
come
to
her
.
He
did
not
come
.
By
his
*NL*
joyousness
he
had
apparently
endeared
himself
to
the
Dyers
.
Maud
watched
*NL*
him
and
,
after
supper
,
cried
to
him
,
``
Come
sit
down
beside
me
,
bad
boy
!
''
*NL*
Carol
winced
at
his
willingness
to
be
a
bad
boy
and
come
and
sit
,
at
*NL*
his
enjoyment
of
a
not
very
stimulating
game
in
which
Maud
,
Dave
,
and
*NL*
Cy
snatched
slices
of
cold
tongue
from
one
another
's
plates
.
Maud
,
it
*NL*
seemed
,
was
slightly
dizzy
from
the
swim
.
She
remarked
publicly
,
``
Dr.
*NL*
Kennicott
has
helped
me
so
much
by
putting
me
on
a
diet
,
''
but
it
was
*NL*
to
Erik
alone
that
she
gave
the
complete
version
of
her
peculiarity
in
*NL*
being
so
sensitive
,
so
easily
hurt
by
the
slightest
cross
word
,
that
she
*NL*
simply
had
to
have
nice
cheery
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
was
nice
and
cheery
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
assured
herself
,
``
Whatever
faults
I
may
have
,
I
certainly
could
n't
*NL*
ever
be
jealous
.
I
do
like
Maud
;
she
's
always
so
pleasant
.
But
I
wonder
*NL*
if
she
is
n't
just
a
bit
fond
of
fishing
for
men
's
sympathy
?
Playing
*NL*
with
Erik
,
and
her
married
--
Well
--
But
she
looks
at
him
in
that
*NL*
languishing
,
swooning
,
mid-Victorian
way
.
Disgusting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Cy
Bogart
lay
between
the
roots
of
a
big
birch
,
smoking
his
pipe
and
*NL*
teasing
Fern
,
assuring
her
that
a
week
from
now
,
when
he
was
again
a
*NL*
high-school
boy
and
she
his
teacher
,
he
'd
wink
at
her
in
class
.
Maud
*NL*
Dyer
wanted
Erik
to
``
come
down
to
the
beach
to
see
the
darling
little
*NL*
minnies
.
''
Carol
was
left
to
Dave
,
who
tried
to
entertain
her
with
*NL*
humorous
accounts
of
Ella
Stowbody
's
fondness
for
chocolate
peppermints
.
*NL*
She
watched
Maud
Dyer
put
her
hand
on
Erik
's
shoulder
to
steady
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disgusting
!
''
she
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
Cy
Bogart
covered
Fern
's
nervous
hand
with
his
red
paw
,
and
when
she
*NL*
bounced
with
half-anger
and
shrieked
,
``
Let
go
,
I
tell
you
!
''
he
grinned
*NL*
and
waved
his
pipe
--
a
gangling
twenty-year-old
satyr
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Disgusting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Maud
and
Erik
returned
and
the
grouping
shifted
,
Erik
muttered
at
*NL*
Carol
,
``
There
's
a
boat
on
shore
.
Let
's
skip
off
and
have
a
row
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
they
think
?
''
she
worried
.
She
saw
Maud
Dyer
peer
at
Erik
with
*NL*
moist
possessive
eyes
.
``
Yes
!
Let
's
!
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
cried
to
the
party
,
with
the
canonical
amount
of
sprightliness
,
*NL*
``
Good-by
,
everybody
.
We
'll
wireless
you
from
China
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
rhythmic
oars
plopped
and
creaked
,
as
she
floated
on
an
unreality
*NL*
of
delicate
gray
over
which
the
sunset
was
poured
out
thin
,
the
*NL*
irritation
of
Cy
and
Maud
slipped
away
.
Erik
smiled
at
her
proudly
.
She
*NL*
considered
him
--
coatless
,
in
white
thin
shirt
.
She
was
conscious
of
his
*NL*
male
differentness
,
of
his
flat
masculine
sides
,
his
thin
thighs
,
his
*NL*
easy
rowing
.
They
talked
of
the
library
,
of
the
movies
.
He
hummed
and
*NL*
she
softly
sang
``
Swing
Low
,
Sweet
Chariot
.
''
A
breeze
shivered
across
the
*NL*
agate
lake
.
The
wrinkled
water
was
like
armor
damascened
and
polished
.
*NL*
The
breeze
flowed
round
the
boat
in
a
chill
current
.
Carol
drew
the
*NL*
collar
of
her
middy
blouse
over
her
bare
throat
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Getting
cold
.
Afraid
we
'll
have
to
go
back
,
''
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
not
go
back
to
them
yet
.
They
'll
be
cutting
up
.
Let
's
keep
along
*NL*
the
shore
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
enjoy
the
`
cutting
up
!
'
Maud
and
you
had
a
beautiful
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
!
We
just
walked
on
the
shore
and
talked
about
fishing
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
relieved
,
and
apologetic
to
her
friend
Maud
.
``
Of
course
.
I
was
*NL*
joking
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
!
Let
's
land
here
and
sit
on
the
shore
--
that
bunch
of
*NL*
hazel-brush
will
shelter
us
from
the
wind
--
and
watch
the
sunset
.
It
's
*NL*
like
melted
lead
.
Just
a
short
while
!
We
do
n't
want
to
go
back
and
*NL*
listen
to
them
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
--
''
She
said
nothing
while
he
sped
ashore
.
The
keel
clashed
*NL*
on
the
stones
.
He
stood
on
the
forward
seat
,
holding
out
his
hand
.
*NL*
They
were
alone
,
in
the
ripple-lapping
silence
.
She
rose
slowly
,
slowly
*NL*
stepped
over
the
water
in
the
bottom
of
the
old
boat
.
She
took
his
hand
*NL*
confidently
.
Unspeaking
they
sat
on
a
bleached
log
,
in
a
russet
twilight
*NL*
which
hinted
of
autumn
.
Linden
leaves
fluttered
about
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
--
Are
you
cold
now
?
''
he
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
little
.
''
She
shivered
.
But
it
was
not
with
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
we
could
curl
up
in
the
leaves
there
,
covered
all

at

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

As
though
it
was
comfortably
understood
that
he
did
*NL*
not
mean
to
be
taken
seriously
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
what
all
the
poets
say

brown
nymph
and
faun

*NL*
``
No

and
small-towny

*NL*
*NL*
``

the
youngest

well

I

like
you
believed
everything

Even
if
you
do

me

I
feel
a
thousand
years
older

you

a

*NL*
*NL*
``
Four

five

*NL*
*NL*
``
Anyway

your

so
innocent

it

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
young

Am
I

Honestly

Truly

''
She
betrayed
for
a
moment
the
*NL*
childish
,
mock-imploring
tone
that
comes
into
the
voice
of
the
most
*NL*
serious
woman
when
an
agreeable
man
treats
her
as
a
girl
;
the
childish
*NL*
tone
and
childish
pursed-up
lips
and
shy
lift
of
the
cheek
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

you
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
're

to

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will

A

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
you
really
like

curl

by
overhead

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
it
's
rather
better
to
be
sitting
here

''
He
twined
his
fingers
*NL*
with
hers
.
``
And
Erik
,
we
must
go
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
somewhat
late
to

all
the

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know

We
must

Are
you
glad
we
ran
away
though

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
She
was
quiet
,
perfectly
simple
.
But
she
rose
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
circled
her
waist
with
a
brusque
arm
.
She
did
not
resist
.
She
did
*NL*
not
care
.
He
was
neither
a
peasant
tailor
,
a
potential
artist
,
a
*NL*
social
complication
,
nor
a
peril
.
He
was
himself
,
and
in
him
,
in
the
*NL*
personality
flowing
from
him
,
she
was
unreasoningly
content
.
In
his
*NL*
nearness
she
caught
a
new
view
of
his
head
;
the
last
light
brought
out
*NL*
the
planes
of
his
neck
,
his
flat
ruddied
cheeks
,
the
side
of
his
nose
,
*NL*
the
depression
of
his
temples
.
Not
as
coy
or
uneasy
lovers
but
as
*NL*
companions
they
walked
to
the
boat
,
and
he
lifted
her
up
on
the
prow
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
to
talk
intently
,
as
he
rowed
:
``
Erik
,
you
've
got
to
work
!
You
*NL*
ought
to
be
a
personage
.
You
're
robbed
of
your
kingdom
.
Fight
for
it
!
*NL*
Take
one
of
these
correspondence
courses
in
drawing
--
they
may
n't
be
any
*NL*
good
in
themselves
,
but
they
'll
make
you
try
to
draw
and
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
they
reached
the
picnic
ground
she
perceived
that
it
was
dark
,
that
*NL*
they
had
been
gone
for
a
long
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
will
they
say
?
''
she
wondered
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
others
greeted
them
with
the
inevitable
storm
of
humor
and
slight
*NL*
vexation
:
``
Where
the
deuce
do
you
think
you
've
been
?
''
``
You
're
a
fine
*NL*
pair
,
you
are
!
''
Erik
and
Carol
looked
self-conscious
;
failed
in
their
*NL*
effort
to
be
witty
.
All
the
way
home
Carol
was
embarrassed
.
Once
Cy
*NL*
winked
at
her
.
That
Cy
,
the
Peeping
Tom
of
the
garage-loft
,
should
*NL*
consider
her
a
fellow-sinner
--
She
was
furious
and
frightened
and
*NL*
exultant
by
turns
,
and
in
all
her
moods
certain
that
Kennicott
would
*NL*
read
her
adventuring
in
her
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
came
into
the
house
awkwardly
defiant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
husband
,
half
asleep
under
the
lamp
,
greeted
her
,
``
Well
,
well
,
have
*NL*
nice
time
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
answer
.
He
looked
at
her
.
But
his
look
did
not
sharpen
.
*NL*
He
began
to
wind
his
watch
,
yawning
the
old
``
Welllllll
,
guess
it
's
about
*NL*
time
to
turn
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
That
was
all
.
Yet
she
was
not
glad
.
She
was
almost
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
called
next
day
.
She
had
a
hen-like
,
crumb-pecking
,
diligent
*NL*
appearance
.
Her
smile
was
too
innocent
.
The
pecking
started
instantly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cy
says
you
had
lots
of
fun
at
the
picnic
yesterday
.
Did
you
enjoy
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
.
I
raced
Cy
at
swimming
.
He
beat
me
badly
.
He
's
so
strong
,
is
n't
*NL*
he
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
boy
,
just
crazy
to
get
into
the
war
,
too
,
but
--
This
Erik
Valborg
*NL*
was
along
,
wa
'n'
t
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
he
's
an
awful
handsome
fellow
,
and
they
say
he
's
smart
.
Do
you
*NL*
like
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
seems
very
polite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cy
says
you
and
him
had
a
lovely
boat-ride
.
My
,
that
must
have
been
*NL*
pleasant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
except
that
I
could
n't
get
Mr.
Valborg
to
say
a
word
.
I
wanted
*NL*
to
ask
him
about
the
suit
Mr.
Hicks
is
making
for
my
husband
.
But
he
*NL*
insisted
on
singing
.
Still
,
it
was
restful
,
floating
around
on
the
water
*NL*
and
singing
.
So
happy
and
innocent
.
Do
n't
you
think
it
's
a
shame
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Bogart
,
that
people
in
this
town
do
n't
do
more
nice
clean
things
like
*NL*
that
,
instead
of
all
this
horrible
gossiping
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
...
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
sounded
vacant
.
Her
bonnet
was
awry
;
she
was
incomparably
*NL*
dowdy
.
Carol
stared
at
her
,
felt
contemptuous
,
ready
at
last
to
rebel
*NL*
against
the
trap
,
and
as
the
rusty
goodwife
fished
again
,
``
Plannin
'
some
*NL*
more
picnics
?
''
she
flung
out
,
``
I
have
n't
the
slightest
idea
!
Oh
.
Is
that
*NL*
Hugh
crying
?
I
must
run
up
to
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
up-stairs
she
remembered
that
Mrs.
Bogart
had
seen
her
walking
*NL*
with
Erik
from
the
railroad
track
into
town
,
and
she
was
chilly
with
*NL*
disquietude
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
two
days
after
,
she
was
effusive
to
Maud
Dyer
,
*NL*
to
Juanita
Haydock
.
She
fancied
that
every
one
was
watching
her
,
but
*NL*
she
could
not
be
sure
,
and
in
rare
strong
moments
she
did
not
care
.
*NL*
She
could
rebel
against
the
town
's
prying
now
that
she
had
something
,
*NL*
however
indistinct
,
for
which
to
rebel
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
passionate
escape
there
must
be
not
only
a
place
from
which
to
flee
*NL*
but
a
place
to
which
to
flee
.
She
had
known
that
she
would
gladly
leave
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
,
leave
Main
Street
and
all
that
it
signified
,
but
she
*NL*
had
had
no
destination
.
She
had
one
now
.
That
destination
was
not
Erik
*NL*
Valborg
and
the
love
of
Erik
.
She
continued
to
assure
herself
that
she
*NL*
was
n't
in
love
with
him
but
merely
``
fond
of
him
,
and
interested
in
his
*NL*
success
.
''
Yet
in
him
she
had
discovered
both
her
need
of
youth
and
the
*NL*
fact
that
youth
would
welcome
her
.
It
was
not
Erik
to
whom
she
must
*NL*
escape
,
but
universal
and
joyous
youth
,
in
class-rooms
,
in
studios
,
in
*NL*
offices
,
in
meetings
to
protest
against
Things
in
General
...
But
*NL*
universal
and
joyous
youth
rather
resembled
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
week
she
thought
of
things
she
wished
to
say
to
him
.
High
,
improving
*NL*
things
.
She
began
to
admit
that
she
was
lonely
without
him
.
Then
she
was
*NL*
afraid
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
at
the
Baptist
church
supper
,
a
week
after
the
picnic
,
that
*NL*
she
saw
him
again
.
She
had
gone
with
Kennicott
and
Aunt
Bessie
to
the
*NL*
supper
,
which
was
spread
on
oilcloth-covered
and
trestle-supported
*NL*
tables
in
the
church
basement
.
Erik
was
helping
Myrtle
Cass
to
fill
*NL*
coffee
cups
for
the
waitresses
.
The
congregation
had
doffed
their
*NL*
piety
.
Children
tumbled
under
the
tables
,
and
Deacon
Pierson
greeted
the
*NL*
women
with
a
rolling
,
``
Where
's
Brother
Jones
,
sister
,
where
's
Brother
*NL*
Jones
?
Not
going
to
be
with
us
tonight
?
Well
,
you
tell
Sister
Perry
to
*NL*
hand
you
a
plate
,
and
make
'em
give
you
enough
oyster
pie
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
shared
in
the
cheerfulness
.
He
laughed
with
Myrtle
,
jogged
her
*NL*
elbow
when
she
was
filling
cups
,
made
deep
mock
bows
to
the
waitresses
*NL*
as
they
came
up
for
coffee
.
Myrtle
was
enchanted
by
his
humor
.
From
the
*NL*
other
end
of
the
room
,
a
matron
among
matrons
,
Carol
observed
*NL*
Myrtle
,
and
hated
her
,
and
caught
herself
at
it
.
``
To
be
jealous
of
*NL*
a
wooden-faced
village
girl
!
''
But
she
kept
it
up
.
She
detested
Erik
;
*NL*
gloated
over
his
gaucheries
--
his
``
breaks
,
''
she
called
them
.
When
he
*NL*
was
too
expressive
,
too
much
like
a
Russian
dancer
,
in
saluting
Deacon
*NL*
Pierson
,
Carol
had
the
ecstasy
of
pain
in
seeing
the
deacon
's
sneer
.
*NL*
When
,
trying
to
talk
to
three
girls
at
once
,
he
dropped
a
cup
and
*NL*
effeminately
wailed
,
``
Oh
dear
!
''
she
sympathized
with
--
and
ached
*NL*
over
--
the
insulting
secret
glances
of
the
girls
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
meanly
hating
him
she
rose
to
compassion
as
she
saw
that
his
eyes
*NL*
begged
every
one
to
like
him
.
She
perceived
how
inaccurate
her
judgments
*NL*
could
be
.
At
the
picnic
she
had
fancied
that
Maud
Dyer
looked
upon
Erik
*NL*
too
sentimentally
,
and
she
had
snarled
,
``
I
hate
these
married
women
who
*NL*
cheapen
themselves
and
feed
on
boys
.
''
But
at
the
supper
Maud
was
one
of
*NL*
the
waitresses
;
she
bustled
with
platters
of
cake
,
she
was
pleasant
to
*NL*
old
women
;
and
to
Erik
she
gave
no
attention
at
all
.
Indeed
,
when
she
*NL*
had
her
own
supper
,
she
joined
the
Kennicotts
,
and
how
ludicrous
it
was
*NL*
to
suppose
that
Maud
was
a
gourmet
of
emotions
Carol
saw
in
the
fact
*NL*
that
she
talked
not
to
one
of
the
town
beaux
but
to
the
safe
Kennicott
*NL*
himself
!
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carol
glanced
at
Erik
again
she
discovered
that
Mrs.
Bogart
had
*NL*
an
eye
on
her
.
It
was
a
shock
to
know
that
at
last
there
was
something
*NL*
which
could
make
her
afraid
of
Mrs.
Bogart
's
spying
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
am
I
doing
?
Am
I
in
love
with
Erik
?
Unfaithful
?
I
?
I
want
youth
*NL*
but
I
do
n't
want
him
--
I
mean
,
I
do
n't
want
youth
--
enough
to
break
up
my
*NL*
life
.
I
must
get
out
of
this
.
Quick
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
said
to
Kennicott
on
their
way
home
,
``
Will
!
I
want
to
run
away
for
a
*NL*
few
days
.
Would
n't
you
like
to
skip
down
to
Chicago
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Still
be
pretty
hot
there
.
No
fun
in
a
big
city
till
winter
.
What
do
*NL*
you
want
to
go
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
People
!
To
occupy
my
mind
.
I
want
stimulus
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Stimulus
?
''
He
spoke
good-naturedly
.
``
Who
's
been
feeding
you
meat
?
You
*NL*
got
that
`
stimulus
'
out
of
one
of
these
fool
stories
about
wives
that
*NL*
do
n't
know
when
they
're
well
off
.
Stimulus
!
Seriously
,
though
,
to
cut
*NL*
out
the
jollying
,
I
ca
n't
get
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
why
do
n't
I
run
off
by
myself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
--
'T
is
n't
the
money
,
you
understand
.
But
what
about
Hugh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Leave
him
with
Aunt
Bessie
.
It
would
be
just
for
a
few
days
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
much
of
this
business
of
leaving
kids
around
.
Bad
for
*NL*
'em
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
you
do
n't
think
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
tell
you
:
I
think
we
better
stay
put
till
after
the
war

Then
*NL*
we
'll
have
a
dandy
long
trip
.
No
,
I
do
n't
think
you
better
plan
much
*NL*
about
going
away
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
she
was
thrown
at
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
awoke
at
ebb-time
,
at
three
of
the
morning
,
woke
sharply
and
fully
;
*NL*
and
sharply
and
coldly
as
her
father
pronouncing
sentence
on
a
cruel
*NL*
swindler
she
gave
judgment
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pitiful
and
tawdry
love-affair
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
splendor
,
no
defiance

self-deceived
little

whispering
in

corners
with
a
pretentious

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

It

She
pitied
herself
that
her
romance
should
be
pitiful
;
she
sighed
that
*NL*
in
this
colorless
hour
,
to
this
austere
self
,
it
should
seem
tawdry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
in
a
very
great
desire
of
rebellion
and
unleashing
of
all
her
*NL*
hatreds
,
``
The
pettier

more
tawdry

I

escape

Any

out

Any
*NL*
humility
so
long
as
I
can
flee

Main

has
done
this
to

I
came

here
eager
for
nobilities

ready
for
work

now

out

*NL*

I
came

with

do

agonizing
their

Like

August

on

--
the
clean

that
used
to

so

fast

sneaking

tittering
in
dark
corners

being
sentimental
and
*NL*
jealous
at
church
suppers

*NL*
*NL*
At
breakfast-time
her
agonies
were
night-blurred
,
and
persisted
only
as
*NL*
a
nervous
irresolution
.

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Few
of
the
aristocrats
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
attended
the
humble
*NL*
folk-meets
of
the
Baptist
and
Methodist
church
suppers
,
where
the
Willis
*NL*
Woodfords
,
the
Dillons
,
the
Champ
Perrys
,
Oleson
the
butcher
,
Brad
Bemis
*NL*
the
tinsmith
,
and
Deacon
Pierson
found
release
from
loneliness
.
But
all
*NL*
of
the
smart
set
went
to
the
lawn-festivals
of
the
Episcopal
Church
,
and
*NL*
were
reprovingly
polite
to
outsiders
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Harry
Haydocks
gave
the
last
lawn-festival
of
the
season
;
a
splendor
*NL*
of
Japanese
lanterns
and
card-tables
and
chicken
patties
and
Neapolitan
*NL*
ice-cream
.
Erik
was
no
longer
entirely
an
outsider
.
He
was
eating
his
*NL*
ice-cream
with
a
group
of
the
people
most
solidly
``
in
''
--
the
Dyers
,
*NL*
Myrtle
Cass
,
Guy
Pollock
,
the
Jackson
Elders
.
The
Haydocks
themselves
*NL*
kept
aloof
,
but
the
others
tolerated
him
.
He
would
never
,
Carol
fancied
,
*NL*
be
one
of
the
town
pillars
,
because
he
was
not
orthodox
in
hunting
and
*NL*
motoring
and
poker
.
But
he
was
winning
approbation
by
his
liveliness
,
*NL*
his
gaiety
--
the
qualities
least
important
in
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
group
summoned
Carol
she
made
several
very
well-taken
points
in
*NL*
regard
to
the
weather
.
*NL*
*NL*
Myrtle
cried
to
Erik
,
``
Come
on
!
We
do
n't
belong
with
these
old
folks

*NL*
I
want
to
make
you
`

with
the
jolliest
girl

she
comes
from
*NL*
Wakamin

she
's
staying
with
Mary
Howland

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
saw
him
being
profuse
to
the
guest
from
Wakamin
.
She
saw
him
*NL*
confidentially
strolling
with
Myrtle
.
She
burst
out
to
Mrs.
Westlake
,
*NL*
``
Valborg
and
Myrtle
seem
to
have
quite
a
crush
on
each
other

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Westlake
glanced
at
her
curiously
before
she
mumbled
,
``
Yes
,
do
n't
*NL*
they
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
mad
,
to
talk
this
way

''
Carol
worried
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
regained
a
feeling
of
social
virtue
by
telling
Juanita
Haydock
*NL*
``
how
darling
her
lawn
looked
with
the
Japanese
lanterns
''
when
she
saw
*NL*
that
Erik
was
stalking
her
.
Though
he
was
merely
ambling
about
with
his
*NL*
hands
in
his
pockets
,
though
he
did
not
peep
at
her
,
she
knew
that
he
*NL*
was
calling
her
.
She
sidled
away
from
Juanita
.
Erik
hastened
to
her
.
She
*NL*
nodded
coolly
-LRB-
she
was
proud
of
her
coolness
-RRB-
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carol
!
I
've
got
a
wonderful
chance
!
Do
n't
know

what
some
ways
*NL*
it
might
be
better
than
going
East
to
take
art

Myrtle
Cass
says
--
I
*NL*
dropped
in
to
say
howdy
to
Myrtle
last
evening
,
and
had
quite
a
long
*NL*
talk
with
her
father
,
and
he
said
he
was
hunting
for
a
fellow
to
go
to
*NL*
work
in
the
flour
mill
and
learn
the
whole
business
,
and
maybe
become
*NL*
general
manager
.
I
know
something
about
wheat
from
my
farming
,
and
I
*NL*
worked
a
couple
of
months
in
the
flour
mill
at
Curlew
when
I
got
sick
of
*NL*
tailoring
.
What
do
you
think
?
You
said
any
work
was
artistic
if
it
was
*NL*
done
by
an
artist

flour
is
so
important

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

This
sensitive
boy
would
be
very
skilfully
stamped
into
conformity
by
*NL*
Lyman
Cass
and
his
sallow
daughter
;
but
did
she
detest
the
plan
for
this

reason

I

But
she
had
no

She
turned
on

sat

Why

I

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
better
not
stay
here
on
the
porch

The
Howlands
across
the
street

are
such
window-peepers

and
Mrs.
Bogart

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
look
at
him
but
she
could
divine
his
tremulousness
as
he
*NL*
stumbled
indoors
.
A
moment
ago
the
night
had
been
coldly
empty
;
now
it
*NL*
was
incalculable
,
hot
,
treacherous
.
But
it
is
women
who
are
the
calm
*NL*
realists
once
they
discard
the
fetishes
of
the
premarital
hunt
.
Carol
*NL*
was
serene
as
she
murmured
,
``
Hungry
?
I
have
some
little
honey-colored
*NL*
cakes
.
You
may
have
two

and
then
you

*NL*
``
Just

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
doubtfully
led
the
way
to
the
hallroom-nursery
.
Their
heads
close
,
*NL*
Erik
's
curls
pleasant
as
they
touched
her
cheek
,
they
looked
in
at
the
*NL*
baby
.
Hugh
was
pink
with
slumber
.
He
had
burrowed
into
his
pillow
with
*NL*
such
energy
that
it
was
almost
smothering
him
.
Beside
it
was
a
celluloid
*NL*
rhinoceros
;
tight
in
his
hand
a
torn
picture
of
Old
King
Cole
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Shhh
!
''
said
Carol
,
quite
automatically
.
She
tiptoed
in
to
pat
the
*NL*
pillow
.
As
she
returned
to
Erik
she
had
a
friendly
sense
of
his
waiting
*NL*
for
her
.
They
smiled
at
each
other
.
She
did
not
think
of
Kennicott
,
the
*NL*
baby
's
father
.
What
she
did
think
was
that
some
one
rather
like
Erik
,
an
*NL*
older
and
surer
Erik
,
ought
to
be
Hugh
's
father
.
The
three
of
them
would
*NL*
play
--
incredible
imaginative
games
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carol

You
've
told

about
your

Let
me
peep
in

*NL*
``
But
you

Yes

``
Will

serious

*NL*
``
You

be
more

She
felt
sensible
and
*NL*
superior
;
she
was
energetic
about
pushing
open
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
always
seemed
out
of
place
there
but
Erik
surprisingly
*NL*
harmonized
with
the
spirit
of
the
room
as
he
stroked
the
books
,
glanced
*NL*
at
the
prints
.
He
held
out
his
hands
.
He
came
toward
her
.
She
was
weak
,
*NL*
betrayed
to
a
warm
softness
.
Her
head
was
tilted
back
.
Her
eyes
were
*NL*
closed
.
Her
thoughts
were
formless
but
many-colored
.
She
felt
his
kiss
,
*NL*
diffident
and
reverent
,
on
her
eyelid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
she
knew
that
it
was
impossible
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
shook
herself
.
She
sprang
from
him
.
``
Please

she
said
sharply
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
at
her
unyielding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
fond

she
said

``
Do

*NL*
``
How

It
glorifies

*NL*
``
Dear

I
do
think
there
's
a
tiny

fairy
in

Perhaps
I
'd
have
loved

once

But

Only

*NL*
He
was
gone
.
And
she
was
not
relieved
by
the
quiet
of
the
house
.
She
was
*NL*
empty
and
the
house
was
empty
and
she
needed
him
.
She
wanted
to
go
*NL*
on
talking
,
to
get
this
threshed
out
,
to
build
a
sane
friendship

She
*NL*
wavered
down
to
the
living-room
,
looked
out
of
the
bay-window
.
He
was
*NL*
not
to
be
seen

But
Mrs.
Westlake
was
.
She
was
walking
past
,
and
in
*NL*
the
light
from
the
corner
arc-lamp
she
quickly
inspected
the
porch
,
the
*NL*
windows
.
Carol
dropped
the
curtain
,
stood
with
movement
and
reflection
*NL*
paralyzed
.
Automatically
,
without
reasoning
,
she
mumbled
,
``
I
will
see
*NL*
him
again
soon

make

understand

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
seemed
nervous
and
absent-minded
through
that
supper-hour
,
*NL*
two
evenings
after
.
He
prowled
about
the
living-room
,
then
growled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
the
dickens
have
you
been
saying
to
Ma
Westlake

*NL*
*NL*
Carol

rattled

``
What

I
told

Westlake

up
to
them

From
what
Dave
tells

Ma
Westlake
has
*NL*
been
going
around
town
saying
you
told
her
that
you
hate
Aunt
Bessie

that
you
fixed
up
your
own
room

I
snore

was
too
good

just
recent

sore
on

off

natural

wanted

keep

dark

why
did

advertise

get
a
megaphone

stand
on

*NL*
``

He
patted
her
head
,
flumped
down
behind
his
newspaper
,
said
nothing
*NL*
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
Enemies
leered
through
the
windows
,
stole
on
her
from
the
hall
.
She
had
*NL*
no
one
save
Erik
.
This
kind
good
man
Kennicott
--
he
was
an
elder
*NL*
brother
.
It
was
Erik
,
her
fellow
outcast
,
to
whom
she
wanted
to
run
for
*NL*
sanctuary
.
Through
her
storm
she
was
,
to
the
eye
,
sitting
quietly
with
*NL*
her
fingers
between
the
pages
of
a
baby-blue
book
on
home-dressmaking
.
*NL*
But
her
dismay
at
Mrs.
Westlake
's
treachery
had
risen
to
active
dread
.
*NL*
What
had
the
woman
said
of
her
and
Erik
?
What
did
she
know
?
What
had
she
*NL*
seen
?
Who
else
would
join
in
the
baying
hunt
?
Who
else
had
seen
her
*NL*
with
Erik
?
What
had
she
to
fear
from
the
Dyers
,
Cy
Bogart
,
Juanita
,
Aunt
*NL*
Bessie
?
What
precisely
had
she
answered
to
Mrs.
Bogart
's
questioning
?
*NL*
*NL*
All
next
day
she
was
too
restless
to
stay
home
,
yet
as
she
walked
the
*NL*
streets
on
fictitious
errands
she
was
afraid
of
every
person
she
met
.
*NL*
She
waited
for
them
to
speak
;
waited
with
foreboding
.
She
repeated
,
``
I
*NL*
must
n't
ever
see
Erik
again
.
''
But
the
words
did
not
register
.
She
had
no
*NL*
ecstatic
indulgence
in
the
sense
of
guilt
which
is
,
to
the
women
of
Main
*NL*
Street
,
the
surest
escape
from
blank
tediousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
five
,
crumpled
in
a
chair
in
the
living-room
,
she
started
at
the
*NL*
sound
of
the
bell
.
Some
one
opened
the
door
.
She
waited
,
uneasy
.
Vida
*NL*
Sherwin
charged
into
the
room
.
``
Here

the
one
person
I
can
trust

*NL*
Carol
rejoiced

*NL*
*NL*
Vida
was
serious

affectionate

She
bustled
at
Carol
with
,
``
Oh

Carol
sat

obedient

Vida
fussily
tugged
over
a
large

launched
out
:

*NL*
``

*NL*
``
How
does

matron
look

feels
guilty

Carol
sounded
resentful

*NL*
*NL*
``
Why

Oh

it
would
show

*NL*
``

*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing

a

Vida
's
chirping
slackened

She
looked

at
her
nails

``

always
pretend

so
sophisticated

all

you
're

Just
because
you

so
innocent

evil
thoughts

lurk

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
do
n't

could
actually
think
about
making
love
to

*NL*
*NL*
Her
rather
cheap
sport
ended
abruptly
as
Vida
cried
,
with
contorted
*NL*
face
,
``
What
do
you
know
about
the
thoughts

just
play

know
what
it
means
to
suffer

*NL*
*NL*
There
are
two
insults
which
no
human
being
will
endure
:
the
assertion
*NL*
that
he
has
n't
a
sense
of
humor

the
doubly
impertinent
assertion

said
furiously
,
``

The
dam
of
repressed
imagination
which
Vida
had
*NL*
builded
for
years
,
which
now
,
with
Raymie
off
at
the
wars
,
she
was
*NL*
building
again

gave
way

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

met
you

of
course

but
we
held
hands
,
and
we
were
so
happy

But
I
*NL*
did
n't
feel
I
was
really
suited

I
let
him
go

Please
do

see
now

was
predestined

*NL*
because
I
liked

I

*NL*
Carol
understood
that
Vida
believed
herself
to
have
recited
minutely
and
*NL*
brazenly
a
story
of
intimate
love
;
understood
that
,
in
alarm
,
she
was
*NL*
trying
to
cover
her
shame
as
she
struggled
on
,
``
Liked
him
in
the
most
*NL*
honorable
way
--
simply
ca
n't
help
it
if
I
still
see
things
through
*NL*
his
eyes
--
If
I
gave
him
up
,
I
certainly
am
not
beyond
my
rights
*NL*
in
demanding
that
you
take
care
to
avoid
even
the
appearance
of
evil
*NL*
and
--
''
She
was
weeping
;
an
insignificant
,
flushed
,
ungracefully
*NL*
weeping
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
could
not
endure
it
.
She
ran
to
Vida
,
kissed
her
forehead
,
*NL*
comforted
her
with
a
murmur
of
dove-like
sounds
,
sought
to
reassure
her
*NL*
with
worn
and
hastily
assembled
gifts
of
words
:
``
Oh
,
I
appreciate
it
so
*NL*
much
,
''
and
``
You
are
so
fine
and
splendid
,

and
``
Let
me
assure
you
there
*NL*
is
n't
a
thing
to
what
you
've
heard

''
and
``
Oh
,
indeed
,
I
do
know
how
*NL*
sincere
Will
is
,
and
as
you
say
,
so
--
so
sincere
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
believed
that
she
had
explained
many
deep
and
devious
matters
.
She
*NL*
came
out
of
her
hysteria
like
a
sparrow
shaking
off
rain-drops
.
She
sat
*NL*
up
,
and
took
advantage
of
her
victory
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
want
to
rub
it
in
,
but
you
can
see
for
yourself
now
,
this
is
*NL*
all
a
result
of
your
being
so
discontented
and
not
appreciating
the
dear
*NL*
good
people
here
.
And
another
thing
:
People
like
you
and
me
,
who
want
to
*NL*
reform
things
,
have
to
be
particularly
careful
about
appearances
.
Think
*NL*
how
much
better
you
can
criticize
conventional
customs
if
you
yourself
*NL*
live
up
to
them
,
scrupulously
.
Then
people
ca
n't
say
you
're
attacking
*NL*
them
to
excuse
your
own
infractions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Carol
was
given
a
sudden
great
philosophical
understanding
,
an
*NL*
explanation
of
half
the
cautious
reforms
in
history
.
``
Yes
.
I
've
heard
*NL*
that
plea
.
It
's
a
good
one
.
It
sets
revolts
aside
to
cool
.
It
keeps
*NL*
strays
in
the
flock
.
To
word
it
differently
:
`
You
must
live
up
to
the
*NL*
popular
code
if
you
believe
in
it
;
but
if
you
do
n't
believe
in
it
,
then
*NL*
you
MUST
live
up
to
it
!
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't
think
so
at
all
,
''
said
Vida
vaguely
.
She
began
to
look
hurt
,
*NL*
and
Carol
let
her
be
oracular
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Vida
had
done
her
a
service
;
had
made
all
agonizing
seem
so
fatuous
that
*NL*
she
ceased
writhing
and
saw
that
her
whole
problem
was
simple
as
mutton
:
*NL*
she
was
interested
in
Erik
's
aspiration
;
interest
gave
her
a
hesitating
*NL*
fondness
for
him
;
and
the
future
would
take
care
of
the
event
...
*NL*
But
at
night
,
thinking
in
bed
,
she
protested
,
``
I
'm
not
a
falsely
*NL*
accused
innocent
,
though
!
If
it
were
some
one
more
resolute
than
Erik
,
a
*NL*
fighter
,
an
artist
with
bearded
surly
lips
--
They
're
only
in
books
.
*NL*
Is
that
the
real
tragedy
,
that
I
never
shall
know
tragedy
,
never
find
*NL*
anything
but
blustery
complications
that
turn
out
to
be
a
farce
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
one
big
enough
or
pitiful
enough
to
sacrifice
for
.
Tragedy
in
*NL*
neat
blouses
;
the
eternal
flame
all
nice
and
safe
in
a
kerosene
stove
.
*NL*
Neither
heroic
faith
nor
heroic
guilt
.
Peeping
at
love
from
behind
lace
*NL*
curtains
--
on
Main
Street
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Aunt
Bessie
crept
in
next
day
,
tried
to
pump
her
,
tried
to
prime
the
*NL*
pump
by
again
hinting
that
Kennicott
might
have
his
own
affairs
.
Carol
*NL*
snapped
,
``
Whatever
I
may
do
,
I
'll
have
you
to
understand
that
Will
is
*NL*
only
too
safe
!
''
She
wished
afterward
that
she
had
not
been
so
lofty
.
How
*NL*
much
would
Aunt
Bessie
make
of
``
Whatever
I
may
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
Kennicott
came
home
he
poked
at
things
,
and
hemmed
,
and
brought
*NL*
out
,
``
Saw
aunty
,
this
afternoon
.
She
said
you
were
n't
very
polite
to
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
laughed
.
He
looked
at
her
in
a
puzzled
way
and
fled
to
his
*NL*
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
lay
sleepless
.
She
alternately
considered
ways
of
leaving
Kennicott
,
*NL*
and
remembered
his
virtues
,
pitied
his
bewilderment
in
face
of
the
*NL*
subtle
corroding
sicknesses
which
he
could
not
dose
nor
cut
out
.
Did
n't
*NL*
he
perhaps
need
her
more
than
did
the
book-solaced
Erik
?
Suppose
Will
*NL*
were
to
die
,
suddenly
.
Suppose
she
never
again
saw
him
at
breakfast
,
*NL*
silent
but
amiable
,
listening
to
her
chatter
.
Suppose
he
never
again
*NL*
played
elephant
for
Hugh
.
Suppose
--
A
country
call
,
a
slippery
road
,
*NL*
his
motor
skidding
,
the
edge
of
the
road
crumbling
,
the
car
turning
*NL*
turtle
,
Will
pinned
beneath
,
suffering
,
brought
home
maimed
,
looking
at
*NL*
her
with
spaniel
eyes
--
or
waiting
for
her
,
calling
for
her
,
while
she
*NL*
was
in
Chicago
,
knowing
nothing
of
it
.
Suppose
he
were
sued
by
some
*NL*
vicious
shrieking
woman
for
malpractice
.
He
tried
to
get
witnesses
;
*NL*
Westlake
spread
lies
;
his
friends
doubted
him
;
his
self-confidence
was
*NL*
so
broken
that
it
was
horrible
to
see
the
indecision
of
the
decisive
*NL*
man
;
he
was
convicted
,
handcuffed
,
taken
on
a
train
--
*NL*
*NL*
She
ran
to
his
room
.
At
her
nervous
push
the
door
swung
sharply
in
,
*NL*
struck
a
chair
.
He
awoke
,
gasped
,
then
in
a
steady
voice
:
``
What
is
it
,
*NL*
dear
?
Anything
wrong
?
''
She
darted
to
him
,
fumbled
for
the
familiar
harsh
*NL*
bristly
cheek
.
How
well
she
knew
it
,
every
seam
,
and
hardness
of
bone
,
*NL*
and
roll
of
fat
!
Yet
when
he
sighed
,
``
This
is
a
nice
visit
,
''
and
dropped
*NL*
his
hand
on
her
thin-covered
shoulder
,
she
said
,
too
cheerily
,
``
I
*NL*
thought
I
heard
you
moaning
.
So
silly
of
me
.
Good
night
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
see
Erik
for
a
fortnight
,
save
once
at
church
and
once
when
*NL*
she
went
to
the
tailor
shop
to
talk
over
the
plans
,
contingencies
,
and
*NL*
strategy
of
Kennicott
's
annual
campaign
for
getting
a
new
suit
.
Nat
*NL*
Hicks
was
there
,
and
he
was
not
so
deferential
as
he
had
been
.
With
*NL*
unnecessary
jauntiness
he
chuckled
,
``
Some
nice
flannels
,
them
*NL*
samples
,
heh
?
''
Needlessly
he
touched
her
arm
to
call
attention
to
the
*NL*
fashion-plates
,
and
humorously
he
glanced
from
her
to
Erik
.
At
home
she
*NL*
wondered
if
the
little
beast
might
not
be
suggesting
himself
as
a
rival
*NL*
to
Erik
,
but
that
abysmal
bedragglement
she
would
not
consider
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
Juanita
Haydock
slowly
walking
past
the
house
--
as
Mrs.
Westlake
*NL*
had
once
walked
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
Mrs.
Westlake
in
Uncle
Whittier
's
store
,
and
before
that
alert
*NL*
stare
forgot
her
determination
to
be
rude
,
and
was
shakily
cordial
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sure
that
all
the
men
on
the
street
,
even
Guy
Pollock
and
Sam
*NL*
Clark
,
leered
at
her
in
an
interested
hopeful
way
,
as
though
she
were
*NL*
a
notorious
divorcee
.
She
felt
as
insecure
as
a
shadowed
criminal
.
She
*NL*
wished
to
see
Erik
,
and
wished
that
she
had
never
seen
him
.
She
fancied
*NL*
that
Kennicott
was
the
only
person
in
town
who
did
not
know
all
--
know
*NL*
incomparably
more
than
there
was
to
know
--
about
herself
and
Erik
.
She
*NL*
crouched
in
her
chair
as
she
imagined
men
talking
of
her
,
thick-voiced
,
*NL*
obscene
,
in
barber
shops
and
the
tobacco-stinking
pool
parlor
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
early
autumn
Fern
Mullins
was
the
only
person
who
broke
the
*NL*
suspense
.
The
frivolous
teacher
had
come
to
accept
Carol
as
of
her
*NL*
own
youth
,
and
though
school
had
begun
she
rushed
in
daily
to
suggest
*NL*
dances
,
welsh-rabbit
parties
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fern
begged
her
to
go
as
chaperon
to
a
barn-dance
in
the
country
,
on
a
*NL*
Saturday
evening
.
Carol
could
not
go
.
The
next
day
,
the
storm
crashed
.

*NL*
CAROL
was
on
the
back
porch
,
tightening
a
bolt
on
the
baby
's
go-cart
,
*NL*
this
Sunday
afternoon
.
Through
an
open
window
of
the
Bogart
house
she
*NL*
heard
a
screeching
,
heard
Mrs.
Bogart
's
haggish
voice
:
*NL*
*NL*
''
...
did
too
,
and
there
's
no
use
your
denying
it
no
you
do
n't
,
you
march
*NL*
yourself
right
straight
out
of
the
house
...
never
in
my
life
heard
of
*NL*
such
...
never
had
nobody
talk
to
me
like
...
walk
in
the
ways
of
sin
*NL*
and
nastiness
...
leave
your
clothes
here
,
and
heaven
knows
that
's
more
*NL*
than
you
deserve
...
any
of
your
lip
or
I
'll
call
the
policeman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
voice
of
the
other
interlocutor
Carol
did
not
catch
,
nor
,
though
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
was
proclaiming
that
he
was
her
confidant
and
present
*NL*
assistant
,
did
she
catch
the
voice
of
Mrs.
Bogart
's
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
row
with
Cy
,
''
Carol
inferred
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
trundled
the
go-cart
down
the
back
steps
and
tentatively
wheeled
it
*NL*
across
the
yard
,
proud
of
her
repairs
.
She
heard
steps
on
the
sidewalk
.
*NL*
She
saw
not
Cy
Bogart
but
Fern
Mullins
,
carrying
a
suit-case
,
hurrying
*NL*
up
the
street
with
her
head
low
.
The
widow
,
standing
on
the
porch
with
*NL*
buttery
arms
akimbo
,
yammered
after
the
fleeing
girl
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
you
dare
show
your
face
on
this
block
again
.
You
can
send
the
*NL*
drayman
for
your
trunk
.
My
house
has
been
contaminated
long
enough
.
Why
*NL*
the
Lord
should
afflict
me
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fern
was
gone
.
The
righteous
widow
glared
,
banged
into
the
house
,
came
*NL*
out
poking
at
her
bonnet
,
marched
away
.
By
this
time
Carol
was
staring
*NL*
in
a
manner
not
visibly
to
be
distinguished
from
the
window-peeping
of
*NL*
the
rest
of
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
saw
Mrs.
Bogart
enter
the
Howland
house
,
*NL*
then
the
Casses
'
.
Not
till
suppertime
did
she
reach
the
Kennicotts
.
The
*NL*
doctor
answered
her
ring
,
and
greeted
her
,
``
Well
,
well
?
how
's
the
good
*NL*
neighbor
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
neighbor
charged
into
the
living-room
,
waving
the
most
unctuous
*NL*
of
black
kid
gloves
and
delightedly
sputtering
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
may
well
ask
how
I
am
!
I
really
do
wonder
how
I
could
go
through
*NL*
the
awful
scenes
of
this
day
--
and
the
impudence
I
took
from
that
woman
's
*NL*
tongue
,
that
ought
to
be
cut
out

*NL*
*NL*
``
Whoa

Whoa

up

roared
Kennicott
.
``

down

cool

*NL*
``
I
ca

down

must
hurry

I

own
selfish
cares

I
'd
warned
you

and
heaven

I
do
n't
expect

any

put
in

not
pleasantly

``

Kennicott
was
incredulous

Mrs.

good

much
*NL*
they
cost
or
if
a
person
could
n't
make
hardly
nothing
on
her
board
and
*NL*
room
,
in
fact
I
just
took
her
in
out
of
charity
and
I
might
have
known
*NL*
from
the
kind
of
stockings
and
clothes
that
she
sneaked
into
my
house
in
*NL*
her
trunk
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
got
her
story
she
had
five
more
minutes
of
obscene
*NL*
wallowing
.
The
gutter
comedy
turned
into
high
tragedy
,
with
Nemesis
*NL*
in
black
kid
gloves
.
The
actual
story
was
simple
,
depressing
,
and
*NL*
unimportant
.
As
to
details
Mrs.
Bogart
was
indefinite
,
and
angry
that
*NL*
she
should
be
questioned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fern
Mullins
and
Cy
had
,
the
evening
before
,
driven
alone
to
a
*NL*
barn-dance
in
the
country
.
-LRB-
Carol
brought
out
the
admission
that
Fern
*NL*
had
tried
to
get
a
chaperon
.
-RRB-
At
the
dance
Cy
had
kissed
Fern
--
she
*NL*
confessed
that
.
Cy
had
obtained
a
pint
of
whisky
;
he
said
that
he
did
n't
*NL*
remember
where
he
had
got
it
;
Mrs.
Bogart
implied
that
Fern
had
given
*NL*
it
to
him
;
Fern
herself
insisted
that
he
had
stolen
it
from
a
farmer
's
*NL*
overcoat
--
which
,
Mrs.
Bogart
raged
,
was
obviously
a
lie
.
He
had
become
*NL*
soggily
drunk
.
Fern
had
driven
him
home
;
deposited
him
,
retching
and
*NL*
wabbling
,
on
the
Bogart
porch
.
*NL*
*NL*
Never
before
had
her
boy
been
drunk
,
shrieked
Mrs.
Bogart
.
When
*NL*
Kennicott
grunted
,
she
owned
,
``
Well
,
maybe
once
or
twice
I
've
smelled
*NL*
licker
on
his
breath
.
''
She
also
,
with
an
air
of
being
only
too
*NL*
scrupulously
exact
,
granted
that
sometimes
he
did
not
come
home
till
*NL*
morning
.
But
he
could
n't
ever
have
been
drunk
,
for
he
always
had
*NL*
the
best
excuses
:
the
other
boys
had
tempted
him
to
go
down
the
lake
*NL*
spearing
pickerel
by
torchlight
,
or
he
had
been
out
in
a
``
machine
that
*NL*
ran
out
of
gas
.
''
Anyway
,
never
before
had
her
boy
fallen
into
the
hands
*NL*
of
a
``
designing
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
do
you
suppose
Miss
Mullins
could
design
to
do
with
him
?
''
insisted
*NL*
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
was
puzzled
,
gave
it
up
,
went
on
.
This
morning
,
when
she
had
*NL*
faced
both
of
them
,
Cy
had
manfully
confessed
that
all
of
the
blame
was
*NL*
on
Fern
,
because
the
teacher
--
his
own
teacher
--
had
dared
him
to
take
a
*NL*
drink
.
Fern
had
tried
to
deny
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
''
gabbled
Mrs.
Bogart
,
``
then
that
woman
had
the
impudence
to
*NL*
say
to
me
,
`
What
purpose
could
I
have
in
wanting
the
filthy
pup
to
get
*NL*
drunk
?
'
That
's
just
what
she
called
him
--
pup
.
`
I
'll
have
no
such
nasty
*NL*
language
in
my
house
,
'
I
says
,
`
and
you
pretending
and
pulling
the
wool
*NL*
over
people
's
eyes
and
making
them
think
you
're
educated
and
fit
to
be
*NL*
a
teacher
and
look
out
for
young
people
's
morals
--
you
're
worse
'n
any
*NL*
street-walker

I
says
.
I
let
her
have
it
good
.
I
wa
'n'
t
going
to
flinch
*NL*
from
my
bounden
duty
and
let
her
think
that
decent
folks
had
to
stand
*NL*
for
her
vile
talk

`
Purpose
?
'
I
says
,
`
Purpose
?
I
'll
tell
you
what
*NL*
purpose
you
had
!
Ai
n't
I
seen
you
making
up
to
everything
in
pants
*NL*
that
'd
waste
time
and
pay
attention
to
your
impert
`
nence

Ai

I
seen
*NL*
you
showing
off
your
legs
with
them
short
skirts
of
yours
,
trying
*NL*
to
make
out

you

so
girlish
and
la-de-da
,
running
along
the
*NL*
street

''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
very
sick
at
this
version
of
Fern
's
eager
youth
,
but
she
was
*NL*
sicker
as
Mrs.
Bogart
hinted
that
no
one
could
tell
what
had
happened
*NL*
between
Fern
and
Cy
before
the
drive
home
.
Without
exactly
describing
*NL*
the
scene
,
by
her
power
of
lustful
imagination
the
woman
suggested
dark
*NL*
country
places
apart
from
the
lanterns
and
rude
fiddling
and
banging
*NL*
dance-steps
in
the
barn
,
then
madness
and
harsh
hateful
conquest
.
Carol
*NL*
was
too
sick
to
interrupt
.
It
was
Kennicott
who
cried
,
``
Oh
,
for
God
's
*NL*
sake
quit
it
!
You
have
n't
any
idea
what
happened

You
have
n't
given
us
a
*NL*
single
proof
yet
that
Fern
is
anything
but
a
rattle-brained
youngster

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
,
eh
?
Well
,
what
do
you
say
to
this
?
I
come
straight
out
and
*NL*
I
says
to
her
,
`
Did
you
or
did
you
not
taste
the
whisky
Cy
had
?
'
and
she
*NL*
says
,
'
I
think
I
did
take
one
sip

Cy
made
me
,
'
she
said
.
She
owned
up
*NL*
to
that
much
,
so
you
can
imagine
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
that
prove
her
a

asked
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Carrie
!
Do

you
never
use
a

wailed
the

outraged
Puritan
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

does
it
prove

done
it
myself

*NL*
``
That
's
different

What

Scriptures
tell

`
Strong
drink
is
a
mocker

But
that
's
entirely

different
from
a
teacher
drinking
with
one
of
her
own
pupils
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

it
does
sound
bad

Fern
was
silly

undoubtedly
.
But
as
a
matter
*NL*
of
fact
she
's
only
a
year
or
two
older
than
Cy
and
probably
a
good
many
*NL*
years
younger
in
experience
of
vice

*NL*
*NL*
``
That

not

plenty
old
enough

sinless
town

five
years

ago

*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Bogart
did
not
rage
in
return
.
Suddenly
she
was
hopeless
.
Her
head
*NL*
drooped
.
She
patted
her
black
kid
gloves
,
picked
at
a
thread
of
her
*NL*
faded
brown
skirt
,
and
sighed
,
``
He
's
a
good
boy
,
and
awful
affectionate
*NL*
if
you
treat
him
right

Some
thinks
he
's
terrible
wild
,
but
that
's
*NL*
because
he
's
young
.
And
he
's
so
brave
and
truthful
--
why
,
he
was
one
of
*NL*
the
first
in
town
that
wanted
to
enlist
for
the
war
,
and
I
had
to
speak
*NL*
real
sharp
to
him
to
keep
him
from
running
away
.
I
did
n't
want
him
to
*NL*
get
into
no
bad
influences
round
these
camps
--
and
then
,
''
Mrs.
Bogart
*NL*
rose
from
her
pitifulness
,
recovered
her
pace
,
``
then
I
go
and
bring
into
*NL*
my
own
house
a
woman
that
's
worse
,
when
all

said
and
done
,
than
any
*NL*
bad
woman
he
could
have
met

You
say
this
Mullins
woman
is
too
young
*NL*
and
inexperienced
to
corrupt
Cy

Well
then

she
's
too
young

inexperienced
to
teach
him

too

one
or
t

other

your

cake

eat
it

So
it
do
n't
make
no
difference
which
reason
they
fire
*NL*
her
for
,
and
that
's
practically
almost
what
I
said
to
the
school-board

*NL*
``

my

I
ai

dictate
in

manner

I

whether
you
're

to
go
on

as
keeping
here
in
our

among
a
lot
of
innocent

boys

a
woman
that
drinks

smokes

curses

uses
bad
language

*NL*

does
such
dreadful
things

I
would
n't
lay
tongue
to

you
know
*NL*
what
I
mean

I
says

if
so
,
I
'll
just
see
to
it
that
the
town
*NL*
learns
about
it
.

And
that
's
what
I
told
Professor
Mott
,
too
,
being
*NL*
superintendent
--
and
he
's
a
righteous
man
,
not
going
autoing
on
the
*NL*
Sabbath
like
the
school-board
members
.
And
the
professor
as
much
as
*NL*
admitted
he
was
suspicious
of
the
Mullins
woman
himself

*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
was
less
shocked
and
much
less
frightened
than
Carol
,
and
more
*NL*
articulate
in
his
description
of
Mrs.
Bogart
,
when
she
had
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maud
Dyer
telephoned
to
Carol
and
,
after
a
rather
improbable
question
*NL*
about
cooking
lima
beans
with
bacon
,
demanded
,
``
Have
you
heard
the
*NL*
scandal
about
this
Miss
Mullins
and
Cy
Bogart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
sure
it
's
a
lie
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
probably
is
.
''
Maud
's
manner
indicated
that
the
falsity
of
the
story
*NL*
was
an
insignificant
flaw
in
its
general
delightfulness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
crept
to
her
room
,
sat
with
hands
curled
tight
together
as
she
*NL*
listened
to
a
plague
of
voices
.
She
could
hear
the
town
yelping
with
it
,
*NL*
every
soul
of
them
,
gleeful
at
new
details
,
panting
to
win
importance
by
*NL*
having
details
of
their
own
to
add
.
How
well
they
would
make
up
for
what
*NL*
they
had
been
afraid
to
do
by
imagining
it
in
another
!
They
who
had
*NL*
not
been
entirely
afraid
-LRB-
but
merely
careful
and
sneaky
-RRB-
,
all
the
*NL*
barber-shop
roues
and
millinery-parlor
mondaines
,
how
archly
they
*NL*
were
giggling
-LRB-
this
second
--
she
could
hear
them
at
it
-RRB-
;
with
what
*NL*
self-commendation
they
were
cackling
their
suavest
wit
:
``
You
ca
n't
tell
*NL*
ME
she
ai
n't
a
gay
bird
;
I
'm
wise
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
not
one
man
in
town
to
carry
out
their
pioneer
tradition
of
superb
*NL*
and
contemptuous
cursing
,
not
one
to
verify
the
myth
that
their
``
rough
*NL*
chivalry
''
and
``
rugged
virtues
''
were
more
generous
than
the
petty
*NL*
scandal-picking
of
older
lands
,
not
one
dramatic
frontiersman
to
*NL*
thunder
,
with
fantastic
and
fictional
oaths
,
``
What
are
you
hinting
*NL*
at

What
are
you
snickering
at

What
facts

these
*NL*
unheard-of
sins

condemn
so
much

so
well

*NL*
*NL*
No
one
to
say
it
.
Not
Kennicott
nor
Guy
Pollock
nor
Champ
Perry
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
?
Possibly
.
He
would
sputter
uneasy
protest
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
suddenly
wondered
what
subterranean
connection
her
interest
in
Erik
*NL*
had
with
this
affair
.
Was
n't
it
because
they
had
been
prevented
by
her
*NL*
caste
from
bounding
on
her
own
trail
that
they
were
howling
at
Fern
?
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Before
supper
she
found
,
by
half
a
dozen
telephone
calls
,
that
Fern
had
*NL*
fled
to
the
Minniemashie
House
.
She
hastened
there
,
trying
not
to
be
*NL*
self-conscious
about
the
people
who
looked
at
her
on
the
street
.
The
*NL*
clerk
said
indifferently
that
he
``
guessed
''
Miss
Mullins
was
up
in
Room
*NL*
37
,
and
left
Carol
to
find
the
way
.
She
hunted
along
the
stale-smelling
*NL*
corridors
with
their
wallpaper
of
cerise
daisies
and
poison-green
*NL*
rosettes
,
streaked
in
white
spots
from
spilled
water
,
their
frayed
red
*NL*
and
yellow
matting
,
and
rows
of
pine
doors
painted
a
sickly
blue
.
She
*NL*
could
not
find
the
number
.
In
the
darkness
at
the
end
of
a
corridor
she
*NL*
had
to
feel
the
aluminum
figures
on
the
door-panels
.
She
was
startled
*NL*
once
by
a
man
's
voice
:
``
Yep
?
Whadyuh
want
?
''
and
fled
.
When
she
reached
*NL*
the
right
door
she
stood
listening
.
She
made
out
a
long
sobbing
.
There
*NL*
was
no
answer
till
her
third
knock
;
then
an
alarmed
``
Who
is
it
?
Go
*NL*
away
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
hatred
of
the
town
turned
resolute
as
she
pushed
open
the
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yesterday
she
had
seen
Fern
Mullins
in
boots
and
tweed
skirt
and
*NL*
canary-yellow
sweater
,
fleet
and
self-possessed
.
Now
she
lay
across
*NL*
the
bed
,
in
crumpled
lavender
cotton
and
shabby
pumps
,
very
feminine
,
*NL*
utterly
cowed
.
She
lifted
her
head
in
stupid
terror
.
Her
hair
was
in
*NL*
tousled
strings
and
her
face
was
sallow
,
creased
.
Her
eyes
were
a
blur
*NL*
from
weeping
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
n't
!
I
did
n't
!
''
was
all
she
would
say
at
first
,
and
she
repeated
*NL*
it
while
Carol
kissed
her
cheek
,
stroked
her
hair
,
bathed
her
forehead
.
*NL*
She
rested
then
,
while
Carol
looked
about
the
room
--
the
welcome
to
*NL*
strangers
,
the
sanctuary
of
hospitable
Main
Street
,
the
lucrative
*NL*
property
of
Kennicott
's
friend
,
Jackson
Elder
.
It
smelled
of
old
linen
*NL*
and
decaying
carpet
and
ancient
tobacco
smoke
.
The
bed
was
rickety
,
*NL*
with
a
thin
knotty
mattress
;
the
sand-colored
walls
were
scratched
and
*NL*
gouged
;
in
every
corner
,
under
everything
,
were
fluffy
dust
and
cigar
*NL*
ashes
;
on
the
tilted
wash-stand
was
a
nicked
and
squatty
pitcher
;
the
*NL*
only
chair
was
a
grim
straight
object
of
spotty
varnish
;
but
there
was
*NL*
an
altogether
splendid
gilt
and
rose
cuspidor
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
not
try
to
draw
out
Fern
's
story
;
Fern
insisted
on
telling
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
gone
to
the
party
,
not
quite
liking
Cy
but
willing
to
endure
him
*NL*
for
the
sake
of
dancing
,
of
escaping
from
Mrs.
Bogart
's
flow
of
moral
*NL*
comments
,
of
relaxing
after
the
first
strained
weeks
of
teaching
.
Cy
*NL*
``
promised
to
be
good
.
''
He
was
,
on
the
way
out
.
There
were
a
few
workmen
*NL*
from
Gopher
Prairie
at
the
dance
,
with
many
young
farm-people
.
Half
*NL*
a
dozen
squatters
from
a
degenerate
colony
in
a
brush-hidden
hollow
,
*NL*
planters
of
potatoes
,
suspected
thieves
,
came
in
noisily
drunk
.
They
all
*NL*
pounded
the
floor
of
the
barn
in
old-fashioned
square
dances
,
swinging
*NL*
their
partners
,
skipping
,
laughing
,
under
the
incantations
of
Del
*NL*
Snafflin
the
barber
,
who
fiddled
and
called
the
figures
.
Cy
had
two
*NL*
drinks
from
pocket-flasks
.
Fern
saw
him
fumbling
among
the
overcoats
*NL*
piled
on
the
feedbox
at
the
far
end
of
the
barn
;
soon
after
she
heard
a
*NL*
farmer
declaring
that
some
one
had
stolen
his
bottle
.
She
taxed
Cy
with
*NL*
the
theft
;
he
chuckled
,
``
Oh
,
it
's
just
a
joke
;
I
'm
going
to
give
it
*NL*
back
.
''
He
demanded
that
she
take
a
drink
.
Unless
she
did
,
he
would
n't
*NL*
return
the
bottle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
just
brushed
my
lips
with
it
,
and
gave
it
back
to
him
,
''
moaned
Fern
.
*NL*
She
sat
up
,
glared
at
Carol
.
``
Did
you
ever
take
a
drink
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
.
A
few
.
I
'd
love
to
have
one
right
now
!
This
contact
with
*NL*
righteousness
has
about
done
me
up
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fern
could
laugh
then
.
``
So
would
I
!
I
do
n't
suppose
I
've
had
five
drinks
*NL*
in
my
life
,
but
if
I
meet
just
one
more
Bogart
and
Son
--
Well
,
I
did
n't
*NL*
really
touch
that
bottle
--
horrible
raw
whisky
--
though
I
'd
have
loved
*NL*
some
wine
.
I
felt
so
jolly
.
The
barn
was
almost
like
a
stage
scene
--
the
*NL*
high
rafters
,
and
the
dark
stalls
,
and
tin
lanterns
swinging
,
and
a
*NL*
silage-cutter
up
at
the
end
like
some
mysterious
kind
of
machine
.
And
*NL*
I
'd
been
having
lots
of
fun
dancing
with
the
nicest
young
farmer
,
so
*NL*
strong
and
nice
,
and
awfully
intelligent
.
But
I
got
uneasy
when
I
saw
*NL*
how
Cy
was
.
So
I
doubt
if
I
touched
two
drops
of
the
beastly
stuff
.
Do
*NL*
you
suppose
God
is
punishing
me
for
even
wanting
wine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
Mrs.
Bogart
's
god
may
be
--
Main
Street
's
god
.
But
all
the
*NL*
courageous
intelligent
people
are
fighting
him
...
though
he
slay
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fern
danced
again
with
the
young
farmer
;
she
forgot
Cy
while
she
was
*NL*
talking
with
a
girl
who
had
taken
the
University
agricultural
course
.
*NL*
Cy
could
not
have
returned
the
bottle
;
he
came
staggering
toward
*NL*
her
--
taking
time
to
make
himself
offensive
to
every
girl
on
the
way
*NL*
and
to
dance
a
jig
.
She
insisted
on
their
returning
.
Cy
went
with
her
,
*NL*
chuckling
and
jigging
.
He
kissed
her
,
outside
the
door
...
``
And
*NL*
to
think
I
used
to
think
it
was
interesting
to
have
men
kiss
you
at
*NL*
a
dance
!
''
...
She
ignored
the
kiss
,
in
the
need
of
getting
him
home
*NL*
before
he
started
a
fight
.
A
farmer
helped
her
harness
the
buggy
,
while
*NL*
Cy
snored
in
the
seat
.
He
awoke
before
they
set
out
;
all
the
way
home
he
*NL*
alternately
slept
and
tried
to
make
love
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
almost
as
strong
as
he
is
.
I
managed
to
keep
him
away
while
I
*NL*
drove
--
such
a
rickety
buggy
.
I
did
n't
feel
like
a
girl
;
I
felt
like
a
*NL*
scrubwoman
--
no
,
I
guess
I
was
too
scared
to
have
any
feelings
at
all
.
It
*NL*
was
terribly
dark
.
I
got
home
,
somehow
.
But
it
was
hard
,
the
time
I
had
*NL*
to
get
out
,
and
it
was
quite
muddy
,
to
read
a
sign-post
--
I
lit
matches
*NL*
that
I
took
from
Cy
's
coat
pocket
,
and
he
followed
me
--
he
fell
off
*NL*
the
buggy
step
into
the
mud
,
and
got
up
and
tried
to
make
love
to
me
,
*NL*
and
--
I
was
scared
.
But
I
hit
him
.
Quite
hard
.
And
got
in
,
and
so
he
*NL*
ran
after
the
buggy
,
crying
like
a
baby
,
and
I
let
him
in
again
,
and
*NL*
right
away
again
he
was
trying
--
But
no
matter
.
I
got
him
home
.
Up
on
*NL*
the
porch
.
Mrs.
Bogart
was
waiting
up
...
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
,
it
was
funny
;
all
the
time
she
was
--
oh
,
talking
to
me
--
and
Cy
*NL*
was
being
terribly
sick
--
I
just
kept
thinking
,
`
I
've
still
got
to
drive
*NL*
the
buggy
down
to
the
livery
stable
.
I
wonder
if
the
livery
man
will
be
*NL*
awake
?
'
But
I
got
through
somehow
.
I
took
the
buggy
down
to
the
stable
,
*NL*
and
got
to
my
room
.
I
locked
my
door
,
but
Mrs.
Bogart
kept
saying
*NL*
things
,
outside
the
door
.
Stood
out
there
saying
things
about
me
,
*NL*
dreadful
things
,
and
rattling
the
knob
.
And
all
the
while
I
could
hear
*NL*
Cy
in
the
back
yard-being
sick
.
I
do
n't
think
I
'll
ever
marry
any
man
.
*NL*
And
then
today
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
drove
me
right
out
of
the
house
.
She
would
n't
listen
to
me
,
all
*NL*
morning
.
Just
to
Cy
.
I
suppose
he
's
over
his
headache
now
.
Even
at
*NL*
breakfast
he
thought
the
whole
thing
was
a
grand
joke
.
I
suppose
right
*NL*
this
minute
he
's
going
around
town
boasting
about
his
`
conquest
.
'
You
*NL*
understand
--
oh
,
DO
N'T
you
understand
?
I
DID
keep
him
away
!
But
I
do
n't
*NL*
see
how
I
can
face
my
school
.
They
say
country
towns
are
fine
for
*NL*
bringing
up
boys
in
,
but
--
I
ca
n't
believe
this
is
me
,
lying
here
and
*NL*
saying
this
.
I
do
n't
BELIEVE
what
happened
last
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
.
This
was
curious
:
When
I
took
off
my
dress
last
night
--
it
was
a
*NL*
darling
dress
,
I
loved
it
so
,
but
of
course
the
mud
had
spoiled
it
.
I
*NL*
cried
over
it
and
--
No
matter
.
But
my
white
silk
stockings
were
all
*NL*
torn
,
and
the
strange
thing
is
,
I
do
n't
know
whether
I
caught
my
legs
*NL*
in
the
briers
when
I
got
out
to
look
at
the
sign-post
,
or
whether
Cy
*NL*
scratched
me
when
I
was
fighting
him
off
.

Sam
Clark
was
president
of
the
school-board
.
When
Carol
told
him
Fern
's
*NL*
story
Sam
looked
sympathetic
and
neighborly
,
and
Mrs.
Clark
sat
by
*NL*
cooing
,
``
Oh
,
is
n't
that
too
bad
.
''
Carol
was
interrupted
only
when
Mrs.
*NL*
Clark
begged
,
``
Dear
,
do
n't
speak
so
bitter
about
`
pious

people

There

*NL*
lots

When

had
finished

Mrs.

breathed
,
``

I
do
n't

her
story
a

Sam
rumbled

avoided

was
at

Fern
longed

to
face
the
tittering

she
was
too
shaky

Carol
read
to

her
all
day
and
,
by
reassuring
her
,
convinced
her
own
self
that
the
*NL*
school-board

be
just

She
was
less
sure
of

that
evening
when

at

she
heard

Maud
Dyer
,
leaning
back
from

put
in

but
I
*NL*
tell
you
we
got
to
have
decent
women
in
our
schools
.
D'
you
know
what
I
*NL*
heard
?
They
say
whatever
she
may
of
done
afterwards
,
this
Mullins
dame
*NL*
took
two
quarts
of
whisky
to
the
dance
with
her
,
and
got
stewed
before
*NL*
Cy
did
!
Some
tank
,
that
wren
!
Ha
,
ha
,
ha
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Rats
,
I
do
n't
believe
it
,
''
Kennicott
muttered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
Carol
away
before
she
was
able
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
Erik
passing
the
house
,
late
,
alone
,
and
she
stared
after
him
,
*NL*
longing
for
the
lively
bitterness
of
the
things
he
would
say
about
the
*NL*
town
.
Kennicott
had
nothing
for
her
but
``
Oh
,
course
,
ev
`
body
likes
a
*NL*
juicy
story
,
but
they
do
n't
intend
to
be
mean
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
up
to
bed
proving
to
herself
that
the
members
of
the
*NL*
school-board
were
superior
men
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
Tuesday
afternoon
before
she
learned
that
the
board
had
met
*NL*
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
voted
to
``
accept
Miss
Fern
Mullins
's
*NL*
resignation
.
''
Sam
Clark
telephoned
the
news
to
her
.
``
We
're
not
making
*NL*
any
charges
.
We
're
just
letting
her
resign
.
Would
you
like
to
drop
over
*NL*
to
the
hotel
and
ask
her
to
write
the
resignation
,
now
we
've
accepted
*NL*
it
?
Glad
I
could
get
the
board
to
put
it
that
way
.
It
's
thanks
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
ca
n't
you
see
that
the
town
will
take
this
as
proof
of
the
*NL*
charges
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
--
not
--
making
--
no
--
charges
--
whatever
!
''
Sam
was
obviously
finding
*NL*
it
hard
to
be
patient
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fern
left
town
that
evening
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
went
with
her
to
the
train
.
The
two
girls
elbowed
through
a
silent
*NL*
lip-licking
crowd
.
Carol
tried
to
stare
them
down
but
in
face
of
*NL*
the
impishness
of
the
boys
and
the
bovine
gaping
of
the
men
,
she
was
*NL*
embarrassed
.
Fern
did
not
glance
at
them
.
Carol
felt
her
arm
tremble
,
*NL*
though
she
was
tearless
,
listless
,
plodding
.
She
squeezed
Carol
's
hand
,
*NL*
said
something
unintelligible
,
stumbled
up
into
the
vestibule
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
remembered
that
Miles
Bjornstam
had
also
taken
a
train
.
What
would
*NL*
be
the
scene
at
the
station
when
she
herself
took
departure
?
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
up-town
behind
two
strangers
.
*NL*
*NL*
One
of
them
was
giggling
,
``
See
that
good-looking
wench
that
got
on
here
?
*NL*
The
swell
kid
with
the
small
black
hat
?
She
's
some
charmer
!
I
was
here
*NL*
yesterday
,
before
my
jump
to
Ojibway
Falls
,
and
I
heard
all
about
*NL*
her
.
Seems
she
was
a
teacher
,
but
she
certainly
was
a
high-roller
--
O
*NL*
boy
!
--
high
,
wide
,
and
fancy
!
Her
and
couple
of
other
skirts
bought
a
*NL*
whole
case
of
whisky
and
went
on
a
tear
,
and
one
night
,
darned
if
this
*NL*
bunch
of
cradle-robbers
did
n't
get
hold
of
some
young
kids
,
just
small
*NL*
boys
,
and
they
all
got
lit
up
like
a
White
Way
,
and
went
out
to
a
*NL*
roughneck
dance
,
and
they
say
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
narrator
turned
,
saw
a
woman
near
and
,
not
being
a
common
person
nor
*NL*
a
coarse
workman
but
a
clever
salesman
and
a
householder
,
lowered
*NL*
his
voice
for
the
rest
of
the
tale
.
During
it
the
other
man
laughed
*NL*
hoarsely
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
turned
off
on
a
side-street
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
passed
Cy
Bogart
.
He
was
humorously
narrating
some
achievement
to
a
*NL*
group
which
included
Nat
Hicks
,
Del
Snafflin
,
Bert
Tybee
the
bartender
,
*NL*
and
A.
Tennyson
O'Hearn
the
shyster
lawyer
.
They
were
men
far
older
than
*NL*
Cy
but
they
accepted
him
as
one
of
their
own
,
and
encouraged
him
to
go
*NL*
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
week
before
she
received
from
Fern
a
letter
of
which
this
was
a
*NL*
part
:
*NL*
*NL*
...
&
of
course
my
family
did
not
really
believe
the
story
but
as
*NL*
they
were
sure
I
must
have
done
something
wrong
they
just
lectured
*NL*
me
generally
,
in
fact
jawed
me
till
I
have
gone
to
live
at
a
boarding
*NL*
house
.
The
teachers
'
agencies
must
know
the
story
,
man
at
one
almost
*NL*
slammed
the
door
in
my
face
when
I
went
to
ask
about
a
job
,
&
at
another
*NL*
the
woman
in
charge
was
beastly
.
Do
n't
know
what
I
will
do
.
Do
n't
seem
*NL*
to
feel
very
well
.
May
marry
a
fellow
that
's
in
love
with
me
but
he
's
so
*NL*
stupid
that
he
makes
me
SCREAM
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dear
Mrs.
Kennicott
you
were
the
only
one
that
believed
me
.
I
guess
it
's
*NL*
a
joke
on
me
,
I
was
such
a
simp
,
I
felt
quite
heroic
while
I
was
driving
*NL*
the
buggy
back
that
night
&
keeping
Cy
away
from
me
.
I
guess
I
expected
*NL*
the
people
in
Gopher
Prairie
to
admire
me
.
I
did
use
to
be
admired
for
*NL*
my
athletics
at
the
U.
--
just
five
months
ago
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
FOR
a
month
which
was
one
suspended
moment
of
doubt
she
saw
Erik
only
*NL*
casually
,
at
an
Eastern
Star
dance
,
at
the
shop
,
where
,
in
the
*NL*
presence
of
Nat
Hicks
,
they
conferred
with
immense
particularity
on
the
*NL*
significance
of
having
one
or
two
buttons
on
the
cuff
of
Kennicott
's
New
*NL*
Suit
.
For
the
benefit
of
beholders
they
were
respectably
vacuous
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
barred
from
him
,
depressed
in
the
thought
of
Fern
,
Carol
was
*NL*
suddenly
and
for
the
first
time
convinced
that
she
loved
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
told
herself
a
thousand
inspiriting
things
which
he
would
say
if
he
*NL*
had
the
opportunity
;
for
them
she
admired
him
,
loved
him
.
But
she
was
*NL*
afraid
to
summon
him
.
He
understood
,
he
did
not
come
.
She
forgot
her
*NL*
every
doubt
of
him
,
and
her
discomfort
in
his
background
.
Each
day
it
*NL*
seemed
impossible
to
get
through
the
desolation
of
not
seeing
him
.
Each
*NL*
morning
,
each
afternoon
,
each
evening
was
a
compartment
divided
from
all
*NL*
other
units
of
time
,
distinguished
by
a
sudden
``
Oh
!
I
want
to
see
Erik
!
''
*NL*
which
was
as
devastating
as
though
she
had
never
said
it
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
wretched
periods
when
she
could
not
picture
him
.
Usually
*NL*
he
stood
out
in
her
mind
in
some
little
moment
--
glancing
up
from
his
*NL*
preposterous
pressing-iron
,
or
running
on
the
beach
with
Dave
Dyer
.
*NL*
But
sometimes
he
had
vanished
;
he
was
only
an
opinion
.
She
worried
then
*NL*
about
his
appearance
:
Were
n't
his
wrists
too
large
and
red
?
Was
n't
his
*NL*
nose
a
snub
,
like
so
many
Scandinavians
?
Was
he
at
all
the
graceful
*NL*
thing
she
had
fancied
?
When
she
encountered
him
on
the
street
she
was
*NL*
as
much
reassuring
herself
as
rejoicing
in
his
presence
.
More
disturbing
*NL*
than
being
unable
to
visualize
him
was
the
darting
remembrance
of
some
*NL*
intimate
aspect
:
his
face
as
they
had
walked
to
the
boat
together
at
the
*NL*
picnic
;
the
ruddy
light
on
his
temples
,
neck-cords
,
flat
cheeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
a
November
evening
when
Kennicott
was
in
the
country
she
answered
the
*NL*
bell
and
was
confused
to
find
Erik
at
the
door
,
stooped
,
imploring
,
his
*NL*
hands
in
the
pockets
of
his
topcoat
.
As
though
he
had
been
rehearsing
*NL*
his
speech
he
instantly
besought
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Saw
your
husband
driving
away
.
I
've
got
to
see
you
.
I
ca
n't
stand
it
.
*NL*
Come
for
a
walk
.
I
know
!
People
might
see
us
.
But
they
wo
n't
if
we
hike
*NL*
into
the
country
.
I
'll
wait
for
you
by
the
elevator
.
Take
as
long
as
you
*NL*
want
to
--
oh
,
come
quick
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
In
a
few
minutes
,
''
she
promised
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
murmured
,
``
I
'll
just
talk
to
him
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
come
*NL*
home
.
''
She
put
an
her
tweed
coat
and
rubber
overshoes
,
considering
how
*NL*
honest
and
hopeless
are
rubbers
,
how
clearly
their
chaperonage
proved
*NL*
that
she
was
n't
going
to
a
lovers
'
tryst
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
him
in
the
shadow
of
the
grain-elevator
,
sulkily
kicking
at
*NL*
a
rail
of
the
side-track
.
As
she
came
toward
him
she
fancied
that
his
*NL*
whole
body
expanded
.
But
he
said
nothing
,
nor
she
;
he
patted
her
sleeve
,
*NL*
she
returned
the
pat
,
and
they
crossed
the
railroad
tracks
,
found
a
*NL*
road
,
clumped
toward
open
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Chilly
night
,
but
I
like
this
melancholy
gray
,
''
he
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
passed
a
moaning
clump
of
trees
and
splashed
along
the
wet
road
.
*NL*
He
tucked
her
hand
into
the
side-pocket
of
his
overcoat
.
She
caught
his
*NL*
thumb
and
,
sighing
,
held
it
exactly
as
Hugh
held
hers
when
they
went
*NL*
walking
.
She
thought
about
Hugh
.
The
current
maid
was
in
for
the
*NL*
evening
,
but
was
it
safe
to
leave
the
baby
with
her
?
The
thought
was
*NL*
distant
and
elusive
.
*NL*
*NL*
Erik
began
to
talk
,
slowly
,
revealingly
.
He
made
for
her
a
picture
of
*NL*
his
work
in
a
large
tailor
shop
in
Minneapolis
:
the
steam
and
heat
,
and
*NL*
the
drudgery
;
the
men
in
darned
vests
and
crumpled
trousers
,
men
who
*NL*
``
rushed
growlers
of
beer
''
and
were
cynical
about
women
,
who
laughed
at
*NL*
him
and
played
jokes
on
him
.
``
But
I
did
n't
mind
,
because
I
could
keep
*NL*
away
from
them
outside
.
I
used
to
go
to
the
Art
Institute
and
the
Walker
*NL*
Gallery
,
and
tramp
clear
around
Lake
Harriet
,
or
hike
out
to
the
Gates
*NL*
house
and
imagine
it
was
a
chateau
in
Italy
and
I
lived
in
it
.
I
was
a
*NL*
marquis
and
collected
tapestries
--
that
was
after
I
was
wounded
in
Padua
.
*NL*
The
only
really
bad
time
was
when
a
tailor
named
Finkelfarb
found
a
*NL*
diary
I
was
trying
to
keep
and
he
read
it
aloud
in
the
shop
--
it
was
a
*NL*
bad
fight
.
''
He
laughed
.
``
I
got
fined
five
dollars
.
But
that
's
all
gone
*NL*
now
.
Seems
as
though
you
stand
between
me
and
the
gas
stoves
--
the
long
*NL*
flames
with
mauve
edges
,
licking
up
around
the
irons
and
making
that
*NL*
sneering
sound
all
day
--
aaaaah
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
fingers
tightened
about
his
thumb
as
she
perceived
the
hot
low
room
,
*NL*
the
pounding
of
pressing-irons
,
the
reek
of
scorched
cloth
,
and
Erik
*NL*
among
giggling
gnomes
.
His
fingertip
crept
through
the
opening
of
her
*NL*
glove
and
smoothed
her
palm
.
She
snatched
her
hand
away
,
stripped
off
*NL*
her
glove
,
tucked
her
hand
back
into
his
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
saying
something
about
a
``
wonderful
person
.
''
In
her
tranquillity
*NL*
she
let
the
words
blow
by
and
heeded
only
the
beating
wings
of
his
*NL*
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
conscious
that
he
was
fumbling
for
impressive
speech
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
uh
--
Carol
,
I
've
written
a
poem
about
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
nice
.
Let
's
hear
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Damn
it
,
do
n't
be
so
casual
about
it
!
Ca
n't
you
take
me
seriously
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
boy
,
if
I
took
you
seriously
--
!
I
do
n't
want
us
to
be
hurt
*NL*
more
than
--
more
than
we
will
be
.
Tell
me
the
poem
.
I
've
never
had
a
poem
*NL*
written
about
me
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
n't
really
a
poem
.
It
's
just
some
words
that
I
love
because
it
*NL*
seems
to
me
they
catch
what
you
are
.
Of
course
probably
they
wo
n't
seem
*NL*
so
to
anybody
else
,
but
--
Well
--
*NL*
*NL*
Little
and
tender
and
merry
and
wise
*NL*
With
eyes
that
meet
my
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
Do
you
get
the
idea
the
way
I
do
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
!
I
'm
terribly
grateful
!
''
And
she
was
grateful
--
while
she
*NL*
impersonally
noted
how
bad
a
verse
it
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
aware
of
the
haggard
beauty
in
the
lowering
night
.
Monstrous
*NL*
tattered
clouds
sprawled
round
a
forlorn
moon
;
puddles
and
rocks
*NL*
glistened
with
inner
light
.
They
were
passing
a
grove
of
scrub
poplars
,
*NL*
feeble
by
day
but
looming
now
like
a
menacing
wall
.
She
stopped
.
They
*NL*
heard
the
branches
dripping
,
the
wet
leaves
sullenly
plumping
on
the
*NL*
soggy
earth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Waiting
--
waiting
--
everything
is
waiting
,
''
she
whispered
.
She
drew
her
*NL*
hand
from
his
,
pressed
her
clenched
fingers
against
her
lips
.
She
was
*NL*
lost
in
the
somberness
.
``
I
am
happy
--
so
we
must
go
home
,
before
we
have
*NL*
time
to
become
unhappy
.
But
ca
n't
we
sit
on
a
log
for
a
minute
and
just
*NL*
listen
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
Too
wet

But
I
wish
we
could
build
a
fire
,
and
you
could
sit
on
*NL*
my
overcoat
beside
it
.
I
'm
a
grand
fire-builder
!
My
cousin
Lars
and
me
*NL*
spent
a
week
one
time
in
a
cabin
way
up
in
the
Big
Woods
,
snowed
in
.
*NL*
The
fireplace
was
filled
with
a
dome
of
ice
when
we
got
there
,
but
we
*NL*
chopped
it
out
,
and
jammed
the
thing
full
of
pine-boughs
.
Could
n't
we
*NL*
build
a
fire
back
here
in
the
woods
and
sit
by
it
for
a
while
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
pondered
,
half-way
between
yielding
and
refusal
.
Her
head
ached
*NL*
faintly
.
She
was
in
abeyance
.
Everything
,
the
night
,
his
silhouette
,
the
*NL*
cautious-treading
future
,
was
as
undistinguishable
as
though
she
were
*NL*
drifting
bodiless
in
a
Fourth
Dimension
.
While
her
mind
groped
,
the
*NL*
lights
of
a
motor
car
swooped
round
a
bend
in
the
road
,
and
they
stood
*NL*
farther
apart
.
``
What
ought
I
to
do
?
''
she
mused
.
``
I
think
--
Oh
,
I
wo
n't
*NL*
be
robbed
!
I
AM
good
!
If
I
'm
so
enslaved
that
I
ca
n't
sit
by
the
fire
*NL*
with
a
man
and
talk
,
then
I
'd
better
be
dead
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
lights
of
the
thrumming
car
grew
magically
;
were
upon
them
;
abruptly
*NL*
stopped
.
From
behind
the
dimness
of
the
windshield
a
voice
,
annoyed
,
*NL*
sharp
:
``
Hello
there
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
realized
that
it
was
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
irritation
in
his
voice
smoothed
out
.
``
Having
a
walk
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
made
schoolboyish
sounds
of
assent
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Pretty
wet
,
is
n't
it
?
Better
ride
back
.
Jump
up
in
front
here
,
*NL*
Valborg
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
manner
of
swinging
open
the
door
was
a
command
.
Carol
was
conscious
*NL*
that
Erik
was
climbing
in
,
that
she
was
apparently
to
sit
in
the
back
,
*NL*
and
that
she
had
been
left
to
open
the
rear
door
for
herself
.
Instantly
*NL*
the
wonder
which
had
flamed
to
the
gusty
skies
was
quenched
,
and
she
was
*NL*
Mrs.
W.
P.
Kennicott
of
Gopher
Prairie
,
riding
in
a
squeaking
old
car
,
*NL*
and
likely
to
be
lectured
by
her
husband
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
feared
what
Kennicott
would
say
to
Erik
.
She
bent
toward
them
.
*NL*
Kennicott
was
observing
,
``
Going
to
have
some
rain
before
the
night
's
*NL*
over
,
all
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Been
funny
season
this
year
,
anyway
.
Never
saw
it
with
such
a
cold
*NL*
October
and
such
a
nice
November
.
`
Member
we
had
a
snow
way
back
on
*NL*
October
ninth
!
But
it
certainly
was
nice
up
to
the
twenty-first
,
this
*NL*
month
--
as
I
remember
it
,
not
a
flake
of
snow
in
November
so
far
,
has
*NL*
there
been
?
But
I
should
n't
wonder
if
we
'd
be
having
some
snow
`
most
any
*NL*
time
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
good
chance
of
it
,
''
said
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wish
I
'd
had
more
time
to
go
after
the
ducks
this
fall
.
By
golly
,
what
*NL*
do
you
think
?
''
Kennicott
sounded
appealing
.
``
Fellow
wrote
me
from
Man
*NL*
Trap
Lake
that
he
shot
seven
mallards
and
couple
of
canvas-back
in
one
*NL*
hour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
must
have
been
fine
,
''
said
Erik
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
ignored
.
But
Kennicott
was
blustrously
cheerful
.
He
shouted
*NL*
to
a
farmer
,
as
he
slowed
up
to
pass
the
frightened
team
,
``
There
we
*NL*
are
--
schon
gut
!
''
She
sat
back
,
neglected
,
frozen
,
unheroic
heroine
in
*NL*
a
drama
insanely
undramatic
.
She
made
a
decision
resolute
and
enduring
.
*NL*
She
would
tell
Kennicott
--
What
would
she
tell
him
?
She
could
not
say
*NL*
that
she
loved
Erik
.
DID
she
love
him
?
But
she
would
have
it
out
.
*NL*
She
was
not
sure
whether
it
was
pity
for
Kennicott
's
blindness
,
or
*NL*
irritation
at
his
assumption
that
he
was
enough
to
fill
any
woman
's
*NL*
life
,
which
prompted
her
,
but
she
knew
that
she
was
out
of
the
trap
,
*NL*
that
she
could
be
frank
;
and
she
was
exhilarated
with
the
adventure
of
*NL*
it
...
while
in
front
he
was
entertaining
Erik
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
like
an
hour
on
a
duck-pass
to
make
you
relish
your
victuals
*NL*
and
--
Gosh
,
this
machine
has
n't
got
the
power
of
a
fountain
pen
.
Guess
*NL*
the
cylinders
are
jam-cram-full
of
carbon
again
.
Do
n't
know
but
what
*NL*
maybe
I
'll
have
to
put
in
another
set
of
piston-rings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopped
on
Main
Street
and
clucked
hospitably
,
``
There
,
that
'll
give
*NL*
you
just
a
block
to
walk
.
G
'
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
in
suspense
.
Would
Erik
sneak
away
?
*NL*
*NL*
He
stolidly
moved
to
the
back
of
the
car
,
thrust
in
his
hand
,
muttered
,
*NL*
``
Good
night
--
Carol
.
I
'm
glad
we
had
our
walk
.
''
She
pressed
his
hand
.
The
*NL*
car
was
flapping
on
.
He
was
hidden
from
her
--
by
a
corner
drug
store
on
*NL*
Main
Street
!
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
did
not
recognize
her
till
he
drew
up
before
the
house
.
Then
*NL*
he
condescended
,
``
Better
jump
out
here
and
I
'll
take
the
boat
around
*NL*
back
.
Say
,
see
if
the
back
door
is
unlocked
,
will
you
?
''
She
unlatched
*NL*
the
door
for
him
.
She
realized
that
she
still
carried
the
damp
glove
she
*NL*
had
stripped
off
for
Erik
.
She
drew
it
on
.
She
stood
in
the
center
of
*NL*
the
living-room
,
unmoving
,
in
damp
coat
and
muddy
rubbers
.
Kennicott
was
*NL*
as
opaque
as
ever
.
Her
task
would
n't
be
anything
so
lively
as
having
*NL*
to
endure
a
scolding
,
but
only
an
exasperating
effort
to
command
his
*NL*
attention
so
that
he
would
understand
the
nebulous
things
she
had
to
*NL*
tell
him
,
instead
of
interrupting
her
by
yawning
,
winding
the
clock
,
and
*NL*
going
up
to
bed
.
She
heard
him
shoveling
coal
into
the
furnace
.
He
came
*NL*
through
the
kitchen
energetically
,
but
before
he
spoke
to
her
he
did
*NL*
stop
in
the
hall
,
did
wind
the
clock
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
sauntered
into
the
living-room
and
his
glance
passed
from
her
*NL*
drenched
hat
to
her
smeared
rubbers
.
She
could
hear
--
she
could
hear
,
*NL*
see
,
taste
,
smell
,
touch
--
his
``
Better
take
your
coat
off
,
Carrie
;
looks
*NL*
kind
of
wet
.
''
Yes
,
there
it
was
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Carrie
,
you
better
--
''
He
chucked
his
own
coat
on
a
chair
,
*NL*
stalked
to
her
,
went
on
with
a
rising
tingling
voice
,
''
--
you
better
*NL*
cut
it
out
now
.
I
'm
not
going
to
do
the
out-raged
husband
stunt
.
I
like
*NL*
you
and
I
respect
you
,
and
I
'd
probably
look
like
a
boob
if
I
tried
to
*NL*
be
dramatic
.
But
I
think
it
's
about
time
for
you
and
Valborg
to
call
a
*NL*
halt
before
you
get
in
Dutch
,
like
Fern
Mullins
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Course
.
I
know
all
about
it
.
What
d'
you
expect
in
a
town
that
's
as
*NL*
filled
with
busybodies
,
that
have
plenty
of
time
to
stick
their
noses
*NL*
into
other
folks
'
business
,
as
this
is
?
Not
that
they
've
had
the
nerve
*NL*
to
do
much
tattling
to
me
,
but
they
've
hinted
around
a
lot
,
and
anyway
,
*NL*
I
could
see
for
myself
that
you
liked
him
.
But
of
course
I
knew
how
cold
*NL*
you
were
,
I
knew
you
would
n't
stand
it
even
if
Valborg
did
try
to
hold
*NL*
your
hand
or
kiss
you
,
so
I
did
n't
worry
.
But
same
time
,
I
hope
you
*NL*
do
n't
suppose
this
husky
young
Swede
farmer
is
as
innocent
and
Platonic
*NL*
and
all
that
stuff
as
you
are
!
Wait
now
,
do
n't
get
sore
!
I
'm
not
*NL*
knocking
him
.
He
is
n't
a
bad
sort
.
And
he
's
young
and
likes
to
gas
about
*NL*
books
.
Course
you
like
him
.
That
is
n't
the
real
rub
.
But
have
n't
you
*NL*
just
seen
what
this
town
can
do
,
once
it
goes
and
gets
moral
on
you
,
*NL*
like
it
did
with
Fern
?
You
probably
think
that
two
young
folks
making
*NL*
love
are
alone
if
anybody
ever
is
,
but
there
's
nothing
in
this
town
*NL*
that
you
do
n't
do
in
company
with
a
whole
lot
of
uninvited
but
awful
*NL*
interested
guests
.
Do
n't
you
realize
that
if
Ma
Westlake
and
a
few
*NL*
others
got
started
they
'd
drive
you
up
a
tree
,
and
you
'd
find
yourself
*NL*
so
well
advertised
as
being
in
love
with
this
Valborg
fellow
that
you
'd
*NL*
HAVE
to
be
,
just
to
spite
'em
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
me
sit
down
,
''
was
all
Carol
could
say
.
She
drooped
on
the
couch
,
*NL*
wearily
,
without
elasticity
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
yawned
,
``
Gim
me
your
coat
and
rubbers
,
''
and
while
she
stripped
them
*NL*
off
he
twiddled
his
watch-chain
,
felt
the
radiator
,
peered
at
the
*NL*
thermometer
.
He
shook
out
her
wraps
in
the
hall
,
hung
them
up
with
*NL*
exactly
his
usual
care
.
He
pushed
a
chair
near
to
her
and
sat
bolt
up
.
*NL*
He
looked
like
a
physician
about
to
give
sound
and
undesired
advice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
he
could
launch
into
his
heavy
discourse
she
desperately
got
in
,
*NL*
``
Please
!
I
want
you
to
know
that
I
was
going
to
tell
you
everything

*NL*
tonight

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

I
do
n't

*NL*
*NL*
``
But
there
is

I
'm
fond
of

He
appeals
to
something
in
here

She
*NL*
touched
her
breast
.
``
And
I
admire
him

He
is
n't
just
a
`
young
Swede
*NL*
farmer

He
's
an
artist

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait

a
chance
all
evening

fellow
he
is

Now
it
's
my
turn

I
ca
n't
talk
artistic

*NL*
but

Carrie

do
you
understand

He
leaned
forward
,
thick
*NL*
capable
hands
on
thick
sturdy
thighs
,
mature
and
slow
,
yet
beseeching
.
*NL*
``
No
matter

if
you
are
cold

I
like
you
better
than
anybody

the
world

One
time
I
said
that
you
were
my
soul

And
that
still
goes

You
're
all
the
things
that
I
see
in
a
sunset
when
I
'm
driving
in
from
*NL*
the
country
,
the
things
that
I
like
but
ca
n't
make
poetry
of

Do
you
*NL*
realize
what
my
job
is
?
I
go
round
twenty-four
hours
a
day
,
in
mud
and
*NL*
blizzard
,
trying
my
damnedest
to
heal
everybody
,
rich
or
poor

You

that
*NL*
're
always
spieling
about
how
scientists
ought
to
rule
the
world

instead
of
a

of
spread-eagle
politicians

ca
n't
you
see
that
I

*NL*
all
the
science
there
is
here

And
I
can
stand
the
cold
and
the
bumpy
*NL*
roads

the
lonely
rides
at
night

All
I
need
is
to
have
you
here
at
*NL*
home

welcome
me

I
do

expect
you

be
passionate

not
any
more
*NL*
I
do

I
do
expect
you
to
appreciate
my
work

I
bring
babies
into
*NL*
the
world
,
and
save
lives
,
and
make
cranky
husbands
quit
being
mean
to
*NL*
their
wives

And
then
you
go
and
moon
over
a
Swede
tailor
because
he
can
*NL*
talk
about
how
to
put
ruchings
on
a
skirt

Hell

a
thing
for
a
man
to
*NL*
fuss
over

She
flew
out
at
him
:
``
You

She
huddled
over
folded

like
a
temple
virgin
shivering
on
her
*NL*
knees
before
the
thin
warmth
of
a
brazier

She
could
not

*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
rose
quickly
,
sat
on
the
couch

took
both
her

``

He

along

at

She
snatched
up
his
hand
,
she
kissed
it

Presently
she
sobbed
,
``

marriage

weaves
people
together

not

And
do
you

He
lifted
her
,
carried
her
up-stairs
,
laid
her
on
her
bed
,
turned
to
the
*NL*
door
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Come
kiss

she
whimpered
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
kissed
her
lightly
and
slipped
away
.
For
an
hour
she
heard
him
moving
*NL*
about
his
room
,
lighting
a
cigar
,
drumming
with
his
knuckles
on
a
chair
.
*NL*
She
felt
that
he
was
a
bulwark
between
her
and
the
darkness
that
grew
*NL*
thicker
as
the
delayed
storm
came
down
in
sleet
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
cheery
and
more
casual
than
ever
at
breakfast
.
All
day
she
tried
*NL*
to
devise
a
way
of
giving
Erik
up
.
Telephone
?
The
village
central
would
*NL*
unquestionably
``
listen
in
.
''
A
letter
?
It
might
be
found
.
Go
to
see
*NL*
him
?
Impossible
.
That
evening
Kennicott
gave
her
,
without
comment
,
an
*NL*
envelope
.
The
letter
was
signed
``
E.
V.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
I
know
I
ca
n't
do
anything
but
make
trouble
for
you
,
I
think
.
I
am
going
*NL*
to
Minneapolis
tonight
and
from
there
as
soon
as
I
can
either
to
New
*NL*
York
or
Chicago
.
I
will
do
as
big
things
as
I
can
.
I
--
I
ca
n't
write
I
*NL*
love
you
too
much
--
God
keep
you

*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Until
she
heard
the
whistle
which
told
her
that
the
Minneapolis
train
*NL*
was
leaving
town
,
she
kept
herself
from
thinking
,
from
moving
.
Then
it
*NL*
was
all
over
.
She
had
no
plan
nor
desire
for
anything
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
caught
Kennicott
looking
at
her
over
his
newspaper
she
fled
*NL*
to
his
arms
,
thrusting
the
paper
aside
,
and
for
the
first
time
in
years
*NL*
they
were
lovers
.
But
she
knew
that
she
still
had
no
plan
in
life
,
save
*NL*
always
to
go
along
the
same
streets
,
past
the
same
people
,
to
the
same
*NL*
shops

*NL*
A
week
after
Erik
's
going
the
maid
startled
her
by
announcing
,
``
There
's
*NL*
a
Mr.
Valborg
down-stairs
say
he
vant
to
see
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
conscious
of
the
maid
's
interested
stare
,
angry
at
this
*NL*
shattering
of
the
calm
in
which
she
had
hidden
.
She
crept
down
,
peeped
*NL*
into
the
living-room
.
It
was
not
Erik
Valborg
who
stood
there
;
it
was
a
*NL*
small
,
gray-bearded
,
yellow-faced
man
in
mucky
boots
,
canvas
jacket
,
and
*NL*
red
mittens
.
He
glowered
at
her
with
shrewd
red
eyes
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
de
doc
's
wife
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

''
*NL*
*NL*
``

from

by
Jefferson

I
'm
Erik
's
father

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
He
was
a
monkey-faced
little
man
,
and
not
gentle
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
you
done
wit
'
my
son
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
n't

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I

going

Where
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
really
--
I
presume
that
he
's
in
Minneapolis
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
presume
!
''
He
looked
through
her
with
a
contemptuousness
such
as
*NL*
she
could
not
have
imagined
.
Only
an
insane
contortion
of
spelling
could
*NL*
portray
his
lyric
whine
,
his
mangled
consonants
.
He
clamored
,
``
Presume
!
*NL*
Dot
's
a
fine
word
!
I
do
n't
want
no
fine
words

*NL*
*NL*
``

Valborg

may
stop

do
n't
know
where
your
son

and
there
's
no

reason
why
I
should

Her
defiance
ran
out
in
face
of
his
immense
*NL*
flaxen
stolidity
.
He
raised
his
fist
,
worked
up
his
anger
with
the
*NL*
gesture
,
and
sneered
:

*NL*

shaking

could

manure

flung

hayseed-dusty

The
man
grunted

looked
at

impassively

said
one
word

walked

out

*NL*

heard
the

did

.
Aunt
Bessie
tried
to
*NL*
catechize
her
about
Erik
's
disappearance
,
and
it
was
Kennicott
who
*NL*
silenced
the
woman
with
a
savage
,
``
Say
,
are
you
hinting
that
Carrie
had
*NL*
anything
to
do
with
that
fellow
's
beating
it
?
Then
let
me
tell
you
,
and
*NL*
you
can
go
right
out
and
tell
the
whole
bloomin
'
town
,
that
Carrie
and
*NL*
I
took
Val
--
took
Erik
riding
,
and
he
asked
me
about
getting
a
better
job
*NL*
in
Minneapolis
,
and
I
advised
him
to
go
to
it
...
Getting
much
sugar
*NL*
in
at
the
store
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
Pollock
crossed
the
street
to
be
pleasant
apropos
of
California
and
*NL*
new
novels
.
Vida
Sherwin
dragged
her
to
the
Jolly
Seventeen
.
There
,
with
*NL*
every
one
rigidly
listening
,
Maud
Dyer
shot
at
Carol
,
``
I
hear
Erik
has
*NL*
left
town
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
amiable
.
``
Yes
,
so
I
hear
.
In
fact
,
he
called
me
up
--
told
me
he
*NL*
had
been
offered
a
lovely
job
in
the
city
.
So
sorry
he
's
gone
.
He
would
*NL*
have
been
valuable
if
we
'd
tried
to
start
the
dramatic
association
*NL*
again
.
Still
,
I
would
n't
be
here
for
the
association
myself
,
because
*NL*
Will
is
all
in
from
work
,
and
I
'm
thinking
of
taking
him
to
California
.
*NL*
Juanita
--
you
know
the
Coast
so
well
--
tell
me
:
would
you
start
in
at
Los
*NL*
Angeles
or
San
Francisco
,
and
what
are
the
best
hotels
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
Jolly
Seventeen
looked
disappointed
,
but
the
Jolly
Seventeen
liked
*NL*
to
give
advice
,
the
Jolly
Seventeen
liked
to
mention
the
expensive
*NL*
hotels
at
which
they
had
stayed
.
-LRB-
A
meal
counted
as
a
stay
.
-RRB-
Before
they
*NL*
could
question
her
again
Carol
escorted
in
with
drum
and
fife
the
topic
*NL*
of
Raymie
Wutherspoon
.
Vida
had
news
from
her
husband
.
He
had
been
*NL*
gassed
in
the
trenches
,
had
been
in
a
hospital
for
two
weeks
,
had
been
*NL*
promoted
to
major
,
was
learning
French
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
left
Hugh
with
Aunt
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
for
Kennicott
she
would
have
taken
him
.
She
hoped
that
in
some
*NL*
miraculous
way
yet
unrevealed
she
might
find
it
possible
to
remain
in
*NL*
California
.
She
did
not
want
to
see
Gopher
Prairie
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Smails
were
to
occupy
the
Kennicott
house
,
and
quite
the
hardest
*NL*
thing
to
endure
in
the
month
of
waiting
was
the
series
of
conferences
*NL*
between
Kennicott
and
Uncle
Whittier
in
regard
to
heating
the
garage
and
*NL*
having
the
furnace
flues
cleaned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Did
Carol
,
Kennicott
inquired
,
wish
to
stop
in
Minneapolis
to
buy
new
*NL*
clothes
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
want
to
get
as
far

Los

*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure

sure

Just
as
you
like

Cheer
up

We
're
going

*NL*
Dusk
on
a
snowy
December
afternoon
.
The
sleeper
which
would
connect
*NL*
at
Kansas
City
with
the
California
train
rolled
out
of
St.
Paul
with
*NL*
a
chick-a-chick
,
chick-a-chick
,
chick-a-chick
as
it
crossed
the
other
*NL*
tracks
.
It
bumped
through
the
factory
belt
,
gained
speed
.
Carol
could
*NL*
see
nothing
but
gray
fields
,
which
had
closed
in
on
her
all
the
way
from
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
Ahead
was
darkness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
an
hour
,
in
Minneapolis
,
I
must
have
been
near
Erik

's
still

there

somewhere

He
'll
be
gone
when
I
come
back

I
'll
never
know
where
*NL*
he
has
gone

*NL*
*NL*
As
Kennicott
switched
on
the
seat-light
she
turned
drearily
to

in

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
THEY
journeyed
for
three
and
a
half
months
.
They
saw
the
Grand
Canyon
,
*NL*
the
adobe
walls
of
Sante
Fe
and
,
in
a
drive
from
El
Paso
into
Mexico
,
*NL*
their
first
foreign
land
.
They
jogged
from
San
Diego
and
La
Jolla
to
Los
*NL*
Angeles
,
Pasadena
,
Riverside
,
through
towns
with
bell-towered
missions
*NL*
and
orange-groves
;
they
viewed
Monterey
and
San
Francisco
and
a
forest
*NL*
of
sequoias
.
They
bathed
in
the
surf
and
climbed
foothills
and
danced
,
*NL*
they
saw
a
polo
game
and
the
making
of
motion-pictures
,
they
sent
one
*NL*
hundred
and
seventeen
souvenir
post-cards
to
Gopher
Prairie
,
and
once
,
*NL*
on
a
dune
by
a
foggy
sea
when
she
was
walking
alone
,
Carol
found
an
*NL*
artist
,
and
he
looked
up
at
her
and
said
,
``
Too
damned
wet
to
paint
;
sit
*NL*
down
and
talk
,
''
and
so
for
ten
minutes
she
lived
in
a
romantic
novel
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
only
struggle
was
in
coaxing
Kennicott
not
to
spend
all
his
time
*NL*
with
the
tourists
from
the
ten
thousand
other
Gopher
Prairies
.
In
*NL*
winter
,
California
is
full
of
people
from
Iowa
and
Nebraska
,
Ohio
and
*NL*
Oklahoma
,
who
,
having
traveled
thousands
of
miles
from
their
familiar
*NL*
villages
,
hasten
to
secure
an
illusion
of
not
having
left
them
.
They
*NL*
hunt
for
people
from
their
own
states
to
stand
between
them
and
the
*NL*
shame
of
naked
mountains
;
they
talk
steadily
,
in
Pullmans
,
on
hotel
*NL*
porches
,
at
cafeterias
and
motion-picture
shows
,
about
the
motors
and
*NL*
crops
and
county
politics
back
home
.
Kennicott
discussed
land-prices
*NL*
with
them
,
he
went
into
the
merits
of
the
several
sorts
of
motor
cars
*NL*
with
them
,
he
was
intimate
with
train
porters
,
and
he
insisted
on
seeing
*NL*
the
Luke
Dawsons
at
their
flimsy
bungalow
in
Pasadena
,
where
Luke
sat
*NL*
and
yearned
to
go
back
and
make
some
more
money
.
But
Kennicott
gave
*NL*
promise
of
learning
to
play
.
He
shouted
in
the
pool
at
the
Coronado
,
and
*NL*
he
spoke
of
-LRB-
though
he
did
nothing
more
radical
than
speak
of
-RRB-
buying
*NL*
evening-clothes
.
Carol
was
touched
by
his
efforts
to
enjoy
picture
*NL*
galleries
,
and
the
dogged
way
in
which
he
accumulated
dates
and
*NL*
dimensions
when
they
followed
monkish
guides
through
missions
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
felt
strong
.
Whenever
she
was
restless
she
dodged
her
thoughts
by
*NL*
the
familiar
vagabond
fallacy
of
running
away
from
them
,
of
moving
on
*NL*
to
a
new
place
,
and
thus
she
persuaded
herself
that
she
was
tranquil
.
In
*NL*
March
she
willingly
agreed
with
Kennicott
that
it
was
time
to
go
home
.
*NL*
She
was
longing
for
Hugh
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
left
Monterey
on
April
first
,
on
a
day
of
high
blue
skies
and
*NL*
poppies
and
a
summer
sea
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
train
struck
in
among
the
hills
she
resolved
,
``
I
'm
going
to
love
*NL*
the
fine
Will
Kennicott
quality
that
there
is
in
Gopher
Prairie
.
The
*NL*
nobility
of
good
sense
.
It
will
be
sweet
to
see
Vida
and
Guy
and
the
*NL*
Clarks
.
And
I
'm
going
to
see
my
baby
!
All
the
words
he
'll
be
able
to
say
*NL*
now
!
It
's
a
new
start
.
Everything
will
be
different
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
on
April
first
,
among
dappled
hills
and
the
bronze
of
scrub
oaks
,
*NL*
while
Kennicott
seesawed
on
his
toes
and
chuckled
,
``
Wonder
what
Hugh
'll
*NL*
say
when
he
sees
us
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Three
days
later
they
reached
Gopher
Prairie
in
a
sleet
storm
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
No
one
knew
that
they
were
coming
;
no
one
met
them
;
and
because
of
the
*NL*
icy
roads
,
the
only
conveyance
at
the
station
was
the
hotel
`
bus
,
which
*NL*
they
missed
while
Kennicott
was
giving
his
trunk-check
to
the
station
*NL*
agent
--
the
only
person
to
welcome
them
.
Carol
waited
for
him
in
the
*NL*
station
,
among
huddled
German
women
with
shawls
and
umbrellas
,
and
*NL*
ragged-bearded
farmers
in
corduroy
coats
;
peasants
mute
as
oxen
,
in
a
*NL*
room
thick
with
the
steam
of
wet
coats
,
the
reek
of
the
red-hot
stove
,
*NL*
the
stench
of
sawdust
boxes
which
served
as
cuspidors
.
The
afternoon
*NL*
light
was
as
reluctant
as
a
winter
dawn
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
a
useful
market-center
,
an
interesting
pioneer
post
,
but
it
is
*NL*
not
a
home
for
me
,
''
meditated
the
stranger
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
suggested
,
``
I
'd
`
phone
for
a
flivver
but
it
'd
take
quite
a
*NL*
while
for
it
to
get
here
.
Let
's
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
stepped
uncomfortably
from
the
safety
of
the
plank
platform
and
,
*NL*
balancing
on
their
toes
,
taking
cautious
strides
,
ventured
along
the
*NL*
road
.
The
sleety
rain
was
turning
to
snow
.
The
air
was
stealthily
cold
.
*NL*
Beneath
an
inch
of
water
was
a
layer
of
ice
,
so
that
as
they
wavered
*NL*
with
their
suit-cases
they
slid
and
almost
fell
.
The
wet
snow
drenched
*NL*
their
gloves
;
the
water
underfoot
splashed
their
itching
ankles
.
They
*NL*
scuffled
inch
by
inch
for
three
blocks
.
In
front
of
Harry
Haydock
's
*NL*
Kennicott
sighed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
better
stop
in
here
and
`
phone
for
a
machine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
followed
him
like
a
wet
kitten
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Haydocks
saw
them
laboring
up
the
slippery
concrete
walk
,
up
the
*NL*
perilous
front
steps
,
and
came
to
the
door
chanting
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
well
,
back
again
,
eh
?
Say
,
this
is
fine
!
Have
a
fine
trip
?
*NL*
My
,
you
look
like
a
rose
,
Carol
.
How
did
you
like
the
coast
,
doc
?
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
well
!
Where-all
did
you
go
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
as
Kennicott
began
to
proclaim
the
list
of
places
achieved
,
Harry
*NL*
interrupted
with
an
account
of
how
much
he
himself
had
seen
,
two
years
*NL*
ago
.
When
Kennicott
boasted
,
``
We
went
through
the
mission
at
Santa
*NL*
Barbara
,
''
Harry
broke
in
,
``
Yeh
,
that
's
an
interesting
old
mission
.
Say
,
*NL*
I
'll
never
forget
that
hotel
there
,
doc
.
It
was
swell
.
Why
,
the
rooms
*NL*
were
made
just
like
these
old
monasteries
.
Juanita
and
I
went
from
Santa
*NL*
Barbara
to
San
Luis
Obispo
.
You
folks
go
to
San
Luis
Obispo
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
you
ought
to
gone
to
San
Luis
Obispo
.
And
then
we
went
from
there
*NL*
to
a
ranch
,
least
they
called
it
a
ranch
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
got
in
only
one
considerable
narrative
,
which
began
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
I
never
knew
--
did
you
,
Harry
?
--
that
in
the
Chicago
district
the
*NL*
Kutz
Kar
sells
as
well
as
the
Overland
?
I
never
thought
much
of
the
*NL*
Kutz
.
But
I
met
a
gentleman
on
the
train
--
it
was
when
we
were
pulling
*NL*
out
of
Albuquerque
,
and
I
was
sitting
on
the
back
platform
of
the
*NL*
observation
car
,
and
this
man
was
next
to
me
and
he
asked
me
for
a
*NL*
light
,
and
we
got
to
talking
,
and
come
to
find
out
,
he
came
from
Aurora
,
*NL*
and
when
he
found
out
I
came
from
Minnesota
he
asked
me
if
I
knew
Dr.
*NL*
Clemworth
of
Red
Wing
,
and
of
course
,
while
I
've
never
met
him
,
I
've
*NL*
heard
of
Clemworth
lots
of
times
,
and
seems
he
's
this
man
's
brother
!
*NL*
Quite
a
coincidence
!
Well
,
we
got
to
talking
,
and
we
called
the
*NL*
porter
--
that
was
a
pretty
good
porter
on
that
car
--
and
we
had
a
couple
*NL*
bottles
of
ginger
ale
,
and
I
happened
to
mention
the
Kutz
Kar
,
and
this
*NL*
man
--
seems
he
's
driven
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
cars
--
he
's
got
*NL*
a
Franklin
now
--
and
he
said
that
he
'd
tried
the
Kutz
and
liked
it
*NL*
first-rate
.
Well
,
when
we
got
into
a
station
--
I
do
n't
remember
the
name
*NL*
of
it
--
Carrie
,
what
the
deuce
was
the
name
of
that
first
stop
we
made
*NL*
the
other
side
of
Albuquerque
?
--
well
,
anyway
,
I
guess
we
must
have
*NL*
stopped
there
to
take
on
water
,
and
this
man
and
I
got
out
to
stretch
*NL*
our
legs
,
and
darned
if
there
was
n't
a
Kutz
drawn
right
up
at
the
depot
*NL*
platform
,
and
he
pointed
out
something
I
'd
never
noticed
,
and
I
was
*NL*
glad
to
learn
about
it
:
seems
that
the
gear
lever
in
the
Kutz
is
an
inch
*NL*
longer
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Even
this
chronicle
of
voyages
Harry
interrupted
,
with
remarks
on
the
*NL*
advantages
of
the
ball-gear-shift
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
gave
up
hope
of
adequate
credit
for
being
a
traveled
man
,
and
*NL*
telephoned
to
a
garage
for
a
Ford
taxicab
,
while
Juanita
kissed
Carol
*NL*
and
made
sure
of
being
the
first
to
tell
the
latest
,
which
included
*NL*
seven
distinct
and
proven
scandals
about
Mrs.
Swiftwaite
,
and
one
*NL*
considerable
doubt
as
to
the
chastity
of
Cy
Bogart
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
saw
the
Ford
sedan
making
its
way
over
the
water-lined
ice
,
through
*NL*
the
snow-storm
,
like
a
tug-boat
in
a
fog
.
The
driver
stopped
at
a
*NL*
corner
.
The
car
skidded
,
it
turned
about
with
comic
reluctance
,
crashed
*NL*
into
a
tree
,
and
stood
tilted
on
a
broken
wheel
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Kennicotts
refused
Harry
Haydock
's
not
too
urgent
offer
to
take
them
*NL*
home
in
his
car
``
if
I
can
manage
to
get
it
out
of
the
garage
--
terrible
*NL*
day
--
stayed
home
from
the
store
--
but
if
you
say
so
,
I
'll
take
a
shot
at
*NL*
it
.
''
Carol
gurgled
,
``
No
,
I
think
we
'd
better
walk
;
probably
make
better
*NL*
time
,
and
I
'm
just
crazy
to
see
my
baby
.
''
With
their
suit-cases
they
*NL*
waddled
on
.
Their
coats
were
soaked
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
had
forgotten
her
facile
hopes
.
She
looked
about
with
impersonal
*NL*
eyes
.
But
Kennicott
,
through
rain-blurred
lashes
,
caught
the
glory
that
*NL*
was
Back
Home
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
noted
bare
tree-trunks
,
black
branches
,
the
spongy
brown
earth
*NL*
between
patches
of
decayed
snow
on
the
lawns
.
The
vacant
lots
were
*NL*
full
of
tall
dead
weeds
.
Stripped
of
summer
leaves
the
houses
were
*NL*
hopeless
--
temporary
shelters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
chuckled
,
``
By
golly
,
look
down
there
!
Jack
Elder
must
have
*NL*
painted
his
garage
.
And
look
!
Martin
Mahoney
has
put
up
a
new
fence
*NL*
around
his
chicken
yard
.
Say
,
that
's
a
good
fence
,
eh
?
Chicken-tight
*NL*
and
dog-tight
.
That
's
certainly
a
dandy
fence
.
Wonder
how
much
it
cost
a
*NL*
yard
?
Yes
,
sir
,
they
been
building
right
along
,
even
in
winter
.
Got
more
*NL*
enterprise
than
these
Californians
.
Pretty
good
to
be
home
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
noted
that
all
winter
long
the
citizens
had
been
throwing
garbage
*NL*
into
their
back
yards
,
to
be
cleaned
up
in
spring
.
The
recent
thaw
had
*NL*
disclosed
heaps
of
ashes
,
dog-bones
,
torn
bedding
,
clotted
paint-cans
,
*NL*
all
half
covered
by
the
icy
pools
which
filled
the
hollows
of
the
yards
.
*NL*
The
refuse
had
stained
the
water
to
vile
colors
of
waste
:
thin
red
,
sour
*NL*
yellow
,
streaky
brown
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
chuckled
,
``
Look
over
there
on
Main
Street
!
They
got
the
*NL*
feed
store
all
fixed
up
,
and
a
new
sign
on
it
,
black
and
gold
.
That
'll
*NL*
improve
the
appearance
of
the
block
a
lot
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
noted
that
the
few
people
whom
they
passed
wore
their
raggedest
*NL*
coats
for
the
evil
day
.
They
were
scarecrows
in
a
shanty
town
...
``
To
*NL*
think
,
''
she
marveled
,
``
of
coming
two
thousand
miles
,
past
mountains
*NL*
and
cities
,
to
get
off
here
,
and
to
plan
to
stay
here
!
What
conceivable
*NL*
reason
for
choosing
this
particular
place
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
noted
a
figure
in
a
rusty
coat
and
a
cloth
cap
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
chuckled
,
``
Look
who
's
coming
!
It
's
Sam
Clark
!
Gosh
,
all
rigged
*NL*
out
for
the
weather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
men
shook
hands
a
dozen
times
and
,
in
the
Western
fashion
,
*NL*
bumbled
,
``
Well
,
well
,
well
,
well
,
you
old
hell-hound
,
you
old
devil
,
*NL*
how
are
you
,
anyway
?
You
old
horse-thief
,
maybe
it
ai
n't
good
to
see
*NL*
you
again
!
''
While
Sam
nodded
at
her
over
Kennicott
's
shoulder
,
she
was
*NL*
embarrassed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
should
never
have
gone
away
.
I
'm
out
of
practise
in
lying
.
I
*NL*
wish
they
would
get
it
over
!
Just
a
block
more
and
--
my
baby
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
home
.
She
brushed
past
the
welcoming
Aunt
Bessie
and
knelt
*NL*
by
Hugh
.
As
he
stammered
,
``
O
mummy
,
mummy
,
do
n't
go
away
!
Stay
with
me
,
*NL*
mummy
!
''
she
cried
,
``
No
,
I
'll
never
leave
you
again
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
volunteered
,
``
That
's
daddy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
golly
,
he
knows
us
just
as
if
we
'd
never
been
away
!
''
said
Kennicott
.
*NL*
``
You
do
n't
find
any
of
these
California
kids
as
bright
as
he
is
,
at
his
*NL*
age
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
trunk
came
they
piled
about
Hugh
the
bewhiskered
little
wooden
*NL*
men
fitting
one
inside
another
,
the
miniature
junk
,
and
the
Oriental
*NL*
drum
,
from
San
Francisco
Chinatown
;
the
blocks
carved
by
the
old
*NL*
Frenchman
in
San
Diego
;
the
lariat
from
San
Antonio
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
you
forgive
mummy
for
going
away
?
Will
you
?
''
she
whispered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Absorbed
in
Hugh
,
asking
a
hundred
questions
about
him
--
had
he
had
any
*NL*
colds
?
did
he
still
dawdle
over
his
oatmeal
?
what
about
unfortunate
*NL*
morning
incidents
?
she
viewed
Aunt
Bessie
only
as
a
source
of
*NL*
information
,
and
was
able
to
ignore
her
hint
,
pointed
by
a
coyly
shaken
*NL*
finger
,
``
Now
that
you
've
had
such
a
fine
long
trip
and
spent
so
much
*NL*
money
and
all
,
I
hope
you
're
going
to
settle
down
and
be
satisfied
and
*NL*
not
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Does
he
like
carrots
yet
?
''
replied
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
cheerful
as
the
snow
began
to
conceal
the
slatternly
yards
.
She
*NL*
assured
herself
that
the
streets
of
New
York
and
Chicago
were
as
ugly
as
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
in
such
weather
;
she
dismissed
the
thought
,
``
But
they
*NL*
do
have
charming
interiors
for
refuge
.
''
She
sang
as
she
energetically
*NL*
looked
over
Hugh
's
clothes
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
afternoon
grew
old
and
dark
.
Aunt
Bessie
went
home
.
Carol
took
the
*NL*
baby
into
her
own
room
.
The
maid
came
in
complaining
,
``
I
ca
n't
get
no
*NL*
extra
milk
to
make
chipped
beef
for
supper
.
''
Hugh
was
sleepy
,
and
he
had
*NL*
been
spoiled
by
Aunt
Bessie
.
Even
to
a
returned
mother
,
his
whining
and
*NL*
his
trick
of
seven
times
snatching
her
silver
brush
were
fatiguing
.
As
a
*NL*
background
,
behind
the
noises
of
Hugh
and
the
kitchen
,
the
house
reeked
*NL*
with
a
colorless
stillness
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
the
window
she
heard
Kennicott
greeting
the
Widow
Bogart
as
he
had
*NL*
always
done
,
always
,
every
snowy
evening
:
``
Guess
this
'll
keep
up
all
*NL*
night
.
''
She
waited
.
There
they
were
,
the
furnace
sounds
,
unalterable
,
*NL*
eternal
:
removing
ashes
,
shoveling
coal
.
*NL*
*NL*
Yes
.
She
was
back
home
!
Nothing
had
changed
.
She
had
never
been
away
.
*NL*
California
?
Had
she
seen
it
?
Had
she
for
one
minute
left
this
scraping
*NL*
sound
of
the
small
shovel
in
the
ash-pit
of
the
furnace
?
But
Kennicott
*NL*
preposterously
supposed
that
she
had
.
Never
had
she
been
quite
so
far
*NL*
from
going
away
as
now
when
he
believed
she
had
just
come
back
.
She
*NL*
felt
oozing
through
the
walls
the
spirit
of
small
houses
and
righteous
*NL*
people
.
At
that
instant
she
knew
that
in
running
away
she
had
merely
*NL*
hidden
her
doubts
behind
the
officious
stir
of
travel
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
God
,
do
n't
let
me
begin
agonizing
again
!
''
she
sobbed
.
Hugh
wept
*NL*
with
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Wait
for
mummy
a
second
!
''
She
hastened
down
to
the
cellar
,
to
*NL*
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
standing
before
the
furnace
.
However
inadequate
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
house
,
he
had
seen
to
it
that
the
fundamental
cellar
should
be
large
*NL*
and
clean
,
the
square
pillars
whitewashed
,
and
the
bins
for
coal
and
*NL*
potatoes
and
trunks
convenient
.
A
glow
from
the
drafts
fell
on
the
*NL*
smooth
gray
cement
floor
at
his
feet
.
He
was
whistling
tenderly
,
staring
*NL*
at
the
furnace
with
eyes
which
saw
the
black-domed
monster
as
a
symbol
*NL*
of
home
and
of
the
beloved
routine
to
which
he
had
returned
--
his
*NL*
gipsying
decently
accomplished
,
his
duty
of
viewing
``
sights
''
and
*NL*
``
curios
''
performed
with
thoroughness
.
Unconscious
of
her
,
he
stooped
*NL*
and
peered
in
at
the
blue
flames
among
the
coals
.
He
closed
the
door
*NL*
briskly
,
and
made
a
whirling
gesture
with
his
right
hand
,
out
of
pure
*NL*
bliss
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
saw
her
.
``
Why
,
hello
,
old
lady
!
Pretty
darn
good
to
be
back
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
she
lied
,
while
she
quaked
,
``
Not
now
.
I
ca
n't
face
the
job
of
*NL*
explaining
now
.
He
's
been
so
good
.
He
trusts
me
.
And
I
'm
going
to
break
*NL*
his
heart
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
smiled
at
him
.
She
tidied
his
sacred
cellar
by
throwing
an
empty
*NL*
bluing
bottle
into
the
trash
bin
.
She
mourned
,
``
It
's
only
the
baby
that
*NL*
holds
me
.
If
Hugh
died
--
''
She
fled
upstairs
in
panic
and
made
sure
*NL*
that
nothing
had
happened
to
Hugh
in
these
four
minutes
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
a
pencil-mark
on
a
window-sill
.
She
had
made
it
on
a
September
*NL*
day
when
she
had
been
planning
a
picnic
for
Fern
Mullins
and
Erik
.
Fern
*NL*
and
she
had
been
hysterical
with
nonsense
,
had
invented
mad
parties
for
*NL*
all
the
coming
winter
.
She
glanced
across
the
alley
at
the
room
which
*NL*
Fern
had
occupied
.
A
rag
of
a
gray
curtain
masked
the
still
window
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
think
of
some
one
to
whom
she
wanted
to
telephone
.
There
*NL*
was
no
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Sam
Clarks
called
that
evening
and
encouraged
her
to
describe
the
*NL*
missions
.
A
dozen
times
they
told
her
how
glad
they
were
to
have
her
*NL*
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
good
to
be
wanted
,
''
she
thought
.
``
It
will
drug
me
.
But
--
Oh
,
is
*NL*
all
life
,
always
,
an
unresolved
But
?

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
tried
to
be
content
,
which
was
a
contradiction
in
terms
.
She
*NL*
fanatically
cleaned
house
all
April
.
She
knitted
a
sweater
for
Hugh
.
*NL*
She
was
diligent
at
Red
Cross
work
.
She
was
silent
when
Vida
raved
that
*NL*
though
America
hated
war
as
much
as
ever
,
we
must
invade
Germany
and
*NL*
wipe
out
every
man
,
because
it
was
now
proven
that
there
was
no
soldier
*NL*
in
the
German
army
who
was
not
crucifying
prisoners
and
cutting
off
*NL*
babies
'
hands
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
was
volunteer
nurse
when
Mrs.
Champ
Perry
suddenly
died
of
*NL*
pneumonia
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
her
funeral
procession
were
the
eleven
people
left
out
of
the
Grand
*NL*
Army
and
the
Territorial
Pioneers
,
old
men
and
women
,
very
old
and
weak
,
*NL*
who
a
few
decades
ago
had
been
boys
and
girls
of
the
frontier
,
riding
*NL*
broncos
through
the
rank
windy
grass
of
this
prairie
.
They
hobbled
*NL*
behind
a
band
made
up
of
business
men
and
high-school
boys
,
who
*NL*
straggled
along
without
uniforms
or
ranks
or
leader
,
trying
to
play
*NL*
Chopin
's
Funeral
March
--
a
shabby
group
of
neighbors
with
grave
eyes
,
*NL*
stumbling
through
the
slush
under
a
solemnity
of
faltering
music
.
*NL*
*NL*
Champ
was
broken
.
His
rheumatism
was
worse
.
The
rooms
over
the
store
*NL*
were
silent
.
He
could
not
do
his
work
as
buyer
at
the
elevator
.
Farmers
*NL*
coming
in
with
sled-loads
of
wheat
complained
that
Champ
could
not
read
*NL*
the
scale
,
that
he
seemed
always
to
be
watching
some
one
back
in
the
*NL*
darkness
of
the
bins
.
He
was
seen
slipping
through
alleys
,
talking
to
*NL*
himself
,
trying
to
avoid
observation
,
creeping
at
last
to
the
cemetery
.
*NL*
Once
Carol
followed
him
and
found
the
coarse
,
tobacco-stained
,
*NL*
unimaginative
old
man
lying
on
the
snow
of
the
grave
,
his
thick
arms
*NL*
spread
out
across
the
raw
mound
as
if
to
protect
her
from
the
cold
,
her
*NL*
whom
he
had
carefully
covered
up
every
night
for
sixty
years
,
who
was
*NL*
alone
there
now
,
uncared
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
elevator
company
,
Ezra
Stowbody
president
,
let
him
go
.
The
company
,
*NL*
Ezra
explained
to
Carol
,
had
no
funds
for
giving
pensions
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
have
him
appointed
to
the
postmastership
,
which
,
since
all
*NL*
the
work
was
done
by
assistants
,
was
the
one
sinecure
in
town
,
the
one
*NL*
reward
for
political
purity
.
But
it
proved
that
Mr.
Bert
Tybee
,
the
*NL*
former
bartender
,
desired
the
postmastership
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
her
solicitation
Lyman
Cass
gave
Champ
a
warm
berth
as
night
*NL*
watchman
.
Small
boys
played
a
good
many
tricks
on
Champ
when
he
fell
*NL*
asleep
at
the
mill
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
vicarious
happiness
in
the
return
of
Major
Raymond
Wutherspoon
.
*NL*
He
was
well
,
but
still
weak
from
having
been
gassed
;
he
had
been
*NL*
discharged
and
he
came
home
as
the
first
of
the
war
veterans
.
It
was
*NL*
rumored
that
he
surprised
Vida
by
coming
unannounced
,
that
Vida
fainted
*NL*
when
she
saw
him
,
and
for
a
night
and
day
would
not
share
him
with
the
*NL*
town
.
When
Carol
saw
them
Vida
was
hazy
about
everything
except
Raymie
,
*NL*
and
never
went
so
far
from
him
that
she
could
not
slip
her
hand
under
*NL*
his
.
Without
understanding
why
Carol
was
troubled
by
this
intensity
.
And
*NL*
Raymie
--
surely
this
was
not
Raymie
,
but
a
sterner
brother
of
his
,
this
*NL*
man
with
the
tight
blouse
,
the
shoulder
emblems
,
the
trim
legs
in
boots
.
*NL*
His
face
seemed
different
,
his
lips
more
tight
.
He
was
not
Raymie
;
he
*NL*
was
Major
Wutherspoon
;
and
Kennicott
and
Carol
were
grateful
when
he
*NL*
divulged
that
Paris
was
n't
half
as
pretty
as
Minneapolis
,
that
all
of
*NL*
the
American
soldiers
had
been
distinguished
by
their
morality
when
on
*NL*
leave
.
Kennicott
was
respectful
as
he
inquired
whether
the
Germans
had
*NL*
good
aeroplanes
,
and
what
a
salient
was
,
and
a
cootie
,
and
Going

In
a
week
Major
Wutherspoon
was
made
full
manager
of
the
Bon
Ton
.
Harry
*NL*
Haydock
was
going
to
devote
himself
to
the
half-dozen
branch
stores
*NL*
which
he
was
establishing
at
crossroads
hamlets
.
Harry
would
be
the
*NL*
town
's
rich
man
in
the
coming
generation
,
and
Major
Wutherspoon
would
*NL*
rise
with
him
,
and
Vida
was
jubilant
,
though
she
was
regretful
at
having
*NL*
to
give
up
most
of
her
Red
Cross
work
.
Ray
still
needed
nursing
,
she
*NL*
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Carol
saw
him
with
his
uniform
off
,
in
a
pepper-and
salt
suit
and
*NL*
a
new
gray
felt
hat
,
she
was
disappointed
.
He
was
not
Major
Wutherspoon
;
*NL*
he
was
Raymie
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
month
small
boys
followed
him
down
the
street
,
and
everybody
*NL*
called
him
Major
,
but
that
was
presently
shortened
to
Maje
,
and
the
*NL*
small
boys
did
not
look
up
from
their
marbles
as
he
went
by

The
town
was
booming
,
as
a
result
of
the
war
price
of
wheat
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
wheat
money
did
not
remain
in
the
pockets
of
the
farmers
;
the
towns
*NL*
existed
to
take
care
of
all
that
.
Iowa
farmers
were
selling
their
land
*NL*
at
four
hundred
dollars
an
acre
and
coming
into
Minnesota
.
But
whoever
*NL*
bought
or
sold
or
mortgaged
,
the
townsmen
invited
themselves
to
the
*NL*
feast
--
millers
,
real-estate
men
,
lawyers
,
merchants
,
and
Dr.
Will
*NL*
Kennicott
.
They
bought
land
at
a
hundred
and
fifty
,
sold
it
next
day
at
*NL*
a
hundred
and
seventy
,
and
bought
again
.
In
three
months
Kennicott
made
*NL*
seven
thousand
dollars
,
which
was
rather
more
than
four
times
as
much
as
*NL*
society
paid
him
for
healing
the
sick
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
early
summer
began
a
``
campaign
of
boosting
.
''
The
Commercial
Club
*NL*
decided
that
Gopher
Prairie
was
not
only
a
wheat-center
but
also
the
*NL*
perfect
site
for
factories
,
summer
cottages
,
and
state
institutions
.
In
*NL*
charge
of
the
campaign
was
Mr.
James
Blausser
,
who
had
recently
come
to
*NL*
town
to
speculate
in
land
.
Mr.
Blausser
was
known
as
a
Hustler
.
He
liked
*NL*
to
be
called
Honest
Jim
.
He
was
a
bulky
,
gauche
,
noisy
,
humorous
man
,
*NL*
with
narrow
eyes
,
a
rustic
complexion
,
large
red
hands
,
and
brilliant
*NL*
clothes
.
He
was
attentive
to
all
women
.
He
was
the
first
man
in
town
who
*NL*
had
not
been
sensitive
enough
to
feel
Carol
's
aloofness
.
He
put
his
arm
*NL*
about
her
shoulder
while
he
condescended
to
Kennicott
,
``
Nice
lil
wifey
,
*NL*
I
'll
say
,
doc
,
''
and
when
she
answered
,
not
warmly
,
``
Thank
you
very
much
*NL*
for
the
imprimatur
,
''
he
blew
on
her
neck
,
and
did
not
know
that
he
had
*NL*
been
insulted
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
a
layer-on
of
hands
.
He
never
came
to
the
house
without
trying
to
*NL*
paw
her
.
He
touched
her
arm
,
let
his
fist
brush
her
side
.
She
hated
the
*NL*
man
,
and
she
was
afraid
of
him
.
She
wondered
if
he
had
heard
of
Erik
,
*NL*
and
was
taking
advantage
.
She
spoke
ill
of
him
at
home
and
in
public
*NL*
places
,
but
Kennicott
and
the
other
powers
insisted
,
``
Maybe
he
is
*NL*
kind
of
a
roughneck
,
but
you
got
to
hand
it
to
him
;
he
's
got
more
*NL*
git-up-and-git
than
any
fellow
that
ever
hit
this
burg
.
And
he
's
pretty
*NL*
cute
,
too
.
Hear
what
he
said
to
old
Ezra
?
Chucked
him
in
the
ribs
and
*NL*
said
,
`
Say
,
boy
,
what
do
you
want
to
go
to
Denver
for
?
Wait
'll
I
get
*NL*
time
and
I
'll
move
the
mountains
here
.
Any
mountain
will
be
tickled
to
*NL*
death
to
locate
here
once
we
get
the
White
Way
in

Mr.

snubbed
him

was

He
smiled
on
his

,
and
boomed
:

*NL*
``
I

How
does

know

says
they

Well
I

*NL*
They
ca
n't
spring
that

get
away

*NL*
let
me
tell

that
the
only

in

is
our

London
--
I
spent
three
days
,
sixteen
straight
hours
a

day
,
giving
London
the
once-over

and
let
me
tell
you
that
it
's
nothing

a
bunch
of
fog
and
out-of-date
buildings
that
no
live
American

stand

You
may
not

it

there
ai

And
the

thing
goes
for

next

you
hear
some

``
Now
the
point

:
I
'm
not

insisting
that
Gopher

going

be
Minnesota

pride

the

reorganized

The
amateur

hired

pitcher
from
Des

and
made
a
schedule
of
games
*NL*
with
every
town
for
fifty
miles

The

accompanied
it

The

issued
a
booklet
prepared
by
a
great
and
expensive
*NL*
literary
person
from
a
Minneapolis
advertising
agency

a
red-headed
*NL*

who
smoked

Carol
read
the

with
a
certain
wonder
.
She
learned
that
Plover

Minniemashie

Lakes
were
world-famed
for
their
beauteous
wooded
shores
and
gamey
pike
*NL*
and
bass
not
to
be
equalled
elsewhere
in
the
entire
country
;
that
*NL*
the
residences
of
Gopher
Prairie
were
models
of
dignity
,
comfort
,
and
*NL*
culture
,
with
lawns
and
gardens
known
far

;
that
the
Gopher

Prairie
schools
and
public
library
,
in
its
neat
and
commodious
building
,
*NL*
were
celebrated
throughout

state
;
that
the
Gopher

mills
*NL*
made
the
best
flour
in
the
country
;
that
the
surrounding
farm
lands
were
*NL*
renowned
,
where'er
men
ate
bread
and
butter
,
for
their
incomparable
No.

*NL*
Hard
Wheat
and
Holstein-Friesian
cattle
;
and
that
the
stores
in
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
compared
favorably
with
Minneapolis

Chicago
in
their
*NL*
abundance
of
luxuries
and
necessities
and
the
ever-courteous
attention
*NL*
of
the
skilled

.
She
learned
,
in

that
this
was

was
triumphant
when
the

capture
one
small

planned

coming
much
*NL*
mattered
--
and
a
year
after
,
when
he
failed
,
she
could
not
be
very
*NL*
sorrowful
.
*NL*
*NL*
Retired
farmers
were
moving
into
town
.
The
price
of
lots
had
increased
*NL*
a
third
.
But
Carol
could
discover
no
more
pictures
nor
interesting
food
*NL*
nor
gracious
voices
nor
amusing
conversation
nor
questing
minds
.
She
*NL*
could
,
she
asserted
,
endure
a
shabby
but
modest
town
;
the
town
shabby
*NL*
and
egomaniac
she
could
not
endure
.
She
could
nurse
Champ
Perry
,
*NL*
and
warm
to
the
neighborliness
of
Sam
Clark
,
but
she
could
not
sit
*NL*
applauding
Honest
Jim
Blausser
.
Kennicott
had
begged
her
,
in
courtship
*NL*
days
,
to
convert
the
town
to
beauty
.
If
it
was
now
as
beautiful
as
Mr.
*NL*
Blausser
and
the
Dauntless
said
,
then
her
work
was
over
,
and
she
could
*NL*
go
.

CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
KENNICOTT
was
not
so
inhumanly
patient
that
he
could
continue
to
forgive
*NL*
Carol
's
heresies
,
to
woo
her
as
he
had
on
the
venture
to
California
.
She
*NL*
tried
to
be
inconspicuous
,
but
she
was
betrayed
by
her
failure
to
glow
*NL*
over
the
boosting
.
Kennicott
believed
in
it
;
demanded
that
she
say
*NL*
patriotic
things
about
the
White
Way
and
the
new
factory
.
He
snorted
,
*NL*
``
By
golly
,
I
've
done
all
I
could
,
and
now
I
expect
you
to
play
the
game
.
*NL*
Here
you
been
complaining
for
years
about
us
being
so
poky
,
and
now
when
*NL*
Blausser
comes
along
and
does
stir
up
excitement
and
beautify
the
town
*NL*
like
you
've
always
wanted
somebody
to
,
why
,
you
say
he
's
a
roughneck
,
*NL*
and
you
wo
n't
jump
on
the
band-wagon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Once
,
when
Kennicott
announced
at
noon-dinner
,
``
What
do
you
know
*NL*
about
this
!
They
say
there
's
a
chance
we
may
get
another
*NL*
factory
--
cream-separator
works
!
''
he
added
,
``
You
might
try
to
look
*NL*
interested
,
even
if
you
ai
n't
!
''
The
baby
was
frightened
by
the
Jovian
*NL*
roar
;
ran
wailing
to
hide
his
face
in
Carol
's
lap
;
and
Kennicott
had
to
*NL*
make
himself
humble
and
court
both
mother
and
child
.
The
dim
injustice
*NL*
of
not
being
understood
even
by
his
son
left
him
irritable
.
He
felt
*NL*
injured
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
event
which
did
not
directly
touch
them
brought
down
his
wrath
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
early
autumn
,
news
came
from
Wakamin
that
the
sheriff
had
*NL*
forbidden
an
organizer
for
the
National
Nonpartisan
League
to
speak
*NL*
anywhere
in
the
county
.
The
organizer
had
defied
the
sheriff
,
and
*NL*
announced
that
in
a
few
days
he
would
address
a
farmers
'
political
*NL*
meeting
.
That
night
,
the
news
ran
,
a
mob
of
a
hundred
business
men
*NL*
led
by
the
sheriff
--
the
tame
village
street
and
the
smug
village
faces
*NL*
ruddled
by
the
light
of
bobbing
lanterns
,
the
mob
flowing
between
the
*NL*
squatty
rows
of
shops
--
had
taken
the
organizer
from
his
hotel
,
ridden
*NL*
him
on
a
fence-rail
,
put
him
on
a
freight
train
,
and
warned
him
not
to
*NL*
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
story
was
threshed
out
in
Dave
Dyer
's
drug
store
,
with
Sam
Clark
,
*NL*
Kennicott
,
and
Carol
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
the
way
to
treat
those
fellows
--
only
they
ought
to
have
lynched
*NL*
him
!
''
declared
Sam
,
and
Kennicott
and
Dave
Dyer
joined
in
a
proud
``
You
*NL*
bet
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
walked
out
hastily
,
Kennicott
observing
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Through
supper-time
she
knew
that
he
was
bubbling
and
would
soon
boil
*NL*
over
.
When
the
baby
was
abed
,
and
they
sat
composedly
in
canvas
chairs
*NL*
on
the
porch
,
he
experimented
;
``
I
had
a
hunch
you
thought
Sam
was
kind
*NL*
of
hard
on
that
fellow
they
kicked
out
of
Wakamin
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
n't
Sam
rather
needlessly
heroic
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
All
these
organizers
,
yes
,
and
a
whole
lot
of
the
German
and
*NL*
Squarehead
farmers
themselves
,
they
're
seditious
as
the
devil
--
disloyal
,
*NL*
non-patriotic
,
pro-German
pacifists
,
that
's
what
they
are
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
this
organizer
say
anything
pro-German
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
on
your
life
!
They
did
n't
give
him
a
chance
!
''
His
laugh
was
stagey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
the
whole
thing
was
illegal
--
and
led
by
the
sheriff
!
Precisely
how
*NL*
do
you
expect
these
aliens
to
obey
your
law
if
the
officer
of
the
law
*NL*
teaches
them
to
break
it
?
Is
it
a
new
kind
of
logic
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Maybe
it
was
n't
exactly
regular
,
but
what
's
the
odds
?
They
knew
this
*NL*
fellow
would
try
to
stir
up
trouble
.
Whenever
it
comes
right
down
to
a
*NL*
question
of
defending
Americanism
and
our
constitutional
rights
,
it
's
*NL*
justifiable
to
set
aside
ordinary
procedure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
editorial
did
he
get
that
from
?
''
she
wondered
,
as
she
protested
,
*NL*
``
See
here
,
my
beloved
,
why
ca
n't
you
Tories
declare
war
honestly
?
You
*NL*
do
n't
oppose
this
organizer
because
you
think
he
's
seditious
but
*NL*
because
you
're
afraid
that
the
farmers
he
is
organizing
will
deprive
you
*NL*
townsmen
of
the
money
you
make
out
of
mortgages
and
wheat
and
shops
.
*NL*
Of
course
,
since
we
're
at
war
with
Germany
,
anything
that
any
one
of
us
*NL*
does
n't
like
is
`
pro-German
,
'
whether
it
's
business
competition
or
*NL*
bad
music
.
If
we
were
fighting
England
,
you
'd
call
the
radicals
*NL*
`
pro-English
.
'
When
this
war
is
over
,
I
suppose
you
'll
be
calling
them
*NL*
`
red
anarchists
.
'
What
an
eternal
art
it
is
--
such
a
glittery
delightful
*NL*
art
--
finding
hard
names
for
our
opponents
!
How
we
do
sanctify
our
*NL*
efforts
to
keep
them
from
getting
the
holy
dollars
we
want
for
*NL*
ourselves
!
The
churches
have
always
done
it
,
and
the
political
*NL*
orators
--
and
I
suppose
I
do
it
when
I
call
Mrs.
Bogart
a
`
Puritan
'
and
*NL*
Mr.
Stowbody
a
`
capitalist
.
'
But
you
business
men
are
going
to
beat
all
*NL*
the
rest
of
us
at
it
,
with
your
simple-hearted
,
energetic
,
pompous
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
got
so
far
only
because
Kennicott
was
slow
in
shaking
off
respect
*NL*
for
her
.
Now
he
bayed
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
'll
be
about
all
from
you
!
I
've
stood
for
your
sneering
at
this
*NL*
town

saying
how
ugly
and
dull
it
is
.
I
've
stood
for
your
refusing
*NL*
to
appreciate
good
fellows
like
Sam
.
I
've
even
stood
for
your
ridiculing
*NL*
our
Watch
Gopher
Prairie
Grow
campaign
.
But
one
thing
I
'm
not
going
*NL*
to
stand
:
I
'm
not
going
to
stand
my
own
wife
being
seditious
.
You
can
*NL*
camouflage
all
you
want
to
,
but
you
know
darn
well
that
these
radicals
,
*NL*
as
you
call
'em
,
are
opposed
to
the
war
,
and
let
me
tell
you
right
here
*NL*
and
now
,
and
you
and
all
these
long-haired
men
and
short-haired
women
*NL*
can
beef

you
want

we
're
going

this

applies
to

thing

to
take

*NL*

``

She
was
not
timorous
now

was
grumbling

thought
of
that
complication
,
*NL*
did
you
,
in
this
`
off
to
Bohemia
,
and
express
yourself
,
and
free
love
,
*NL*
and
live
your
own
life

stuff
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
right
to
me
if
you
can
keep
me

Can
you
?

*NL*
He
moved
uneasily
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
month
they
discussed
it
.
They
hurt
each
other
very
much
,
and
*NL*
sometimes
they
were
close
to
weeping
,
and
invariably
he
used
banal
*NL*
phrases
about
her
duties
and
she
used
phrases
quite
as
banal
about
*NL*
freedom
,
and
through
it
all
,
her
discovery
that
she
really
could
get
*NL*
away
from
Main
Street
was
as
sweet
as
the
discovery
of
love
.
Kennicott
*NL*
never
consented
definitely
.
At
most
he
agreed
to
a
public
theory
that
*NL*
she
was
``
going
to
take
a
short
trip
and
see
what
the
East
was
like
in
*NL*
wartime
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
set
out
for
Washington
in
October
--
just
before
the
war
ended
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
determined
on
Washington
because
it
was
less
intimidating
than
*NL*
the
obvious
New
York
,
because
she
hoped
to
find
streets
in
which
Hugh
*NL*
could
play
,
and
because
in
the
stress
of
war-work
,
with
its
demand
for
*NL*
thousands
of
temporary
clerks
,
she
could
be
initiated
into
the
world
of
*NL*
offices
.
*NL*
*NL*
Hugh
was
to
go
with
her
,
despite
the
wails
and
rather
extensive
comments
*NL*
of
Aunt
Bessie
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wondered
if
she
might
not
encounter
Erik
in
the
East
but
it
was
a
*NL*
chance
thought
,
soon
forgotten
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
last
thing
she
saw
on
the
station
platform
was
Kennicott
,
faithfully
*NL*
waving
his
hand
,
his
face
so
full
of
uncomprehending
loneliness
that
he
*NL*
could
not
smile
but
only
twitch
up
his
lips
.
She
waved
to
him
as
long
*NL*
as
she
could
,
and
when
he
was
lost
she
wanted
to
leap
from
the
vestibule
*NL*
and
run
back
to
him
.
She
thought
of
a
hundred
tendernesses
she
had
*NL*
neglected
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
her
freedom
,
and
it
was
empty
.
The
moment
was
not
the
highest
*NL*
of
her
life
,
but
the
lowest
and
most
desolate
,
which
was
altogether
*NL*
excellent
,
for
instead
of
slipping
downward
she
began
to
climb
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sighed
,
``
I
could
n't
do
this
if
it
were
n't
for
Will
's
kindness
,
his
*NL*
giving
me
money
.
''
But
a
second
after
:
``
I
wonder
how
many
women
would
*NL*
always
stay
home
if
they
had
the
money
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hugh
complained
,
``
Notice
me
,
mummy
!
''
He
was
beside
her
on
the
red
plush
*NL*
seat
of
the
day-coach
;
a
boy
of
three
and
a
half
.
``
I
'm
tired
of
playing
*NL*
train
.
Let
's
play
something
else
.
Let
's
go
see
Auntie
Bogart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
NO
!
Do
you
really
like
Mrs.
Bogart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
She
gives
me
cookies
and
she
tells
me
about
the
Dear
Lord
.
You
*NL*
never
tell
me
about
the
Dear
Lord
.
Why
do
n't
you
tell
me
about
the
*NL*
Dear
Lord
?
Auntie
Bogart
says
I
'm
going
to
be
a
preacher
.
Can
I
be
a
*NL*
preacher
?
Can
I
preach
about
the
Dear
Lord
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
please
wait
till
my
generation
has
stopped
rebelling
before
yours
*NL*
starts
in
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
's
a
generation
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
a
ray
in
the
illumination
of
the
spirit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
foolish
.
''
He
was
a
serious
and
literal
person
,
and
rather
*NL*
humorless
.
She
kissed
his
frown
,
and
marveled
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
running
away
from
my
husband
,
after
liking
a
Swedish
ne'er
-
do-well
*NL*
and
expressing
immoral
opinions
,
just
as
in
a
romantic
story
.
And
my
own
*NL*
son
reproves
me
because
I
have
n't
given
him
religious
instruction
.
But
*NL*
the
story
does
n't
go
right
.
I
'm
neither
groaning
nor
being
dramatically
*NL*
saved
.
I
keep
on
running
away
,
and
I
enjoy
it
.
I
'm
mad
with
joy
over
it
.
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
is
lost
back
there
in
the
dust
and
stubble
,
and
I
look
*NL*
forward
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
continued
it
to
Hugh
:
``
Darling
,
do
you
know
what
mother
and
you
are
*NL*
going
to
find
beyond
the
blue
horizon
rim
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
?
''
flatly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
're
going
to
find
elephants
with
golden
howdahs
from
which
peep
young
*NL*
maharanees
with
necklaces
of
rubies
,
and
a
dawn
sea
colored
like
the
*NL*
breast
of
a
dove
,
and
a
white
and
green
house
filled
with
books
and
*NL*
silver
tea-sets
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
cookies
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cookies
?
Oh
,
most
decidedly
cookies
.
We
've
had
enough
of
bread
and
*NL*
porridge
.
We
'd
get
sick
on
too
many
cookies
,
but
ever
so
much
sicker
on
*NL*
no
cookies
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
's
foolish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
,
O
male
Kennicott
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Huh
!
''
said
Kennicott
II
,
and
went
to
sleep
on
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
The
theory
of
the
Dauntless
regarding
Carol
's
absence
:
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Will
Kennicott
and
son
Hugh
left
on
No.
24
on
Saturday
last
for
*NL*
a
stay
of
some
months
in
Minneapolis
,
Chicago
,
New
York
and
Washington
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Kennicott
confided
to
_
Ye
Scribe
_
that
she
will
be
connected
with
one
*NL*
of
the
multifarious
war
activities
now
centering
in
the
Nation
's
*NL*
Capital
for
a
brief
period
before
returning
.
Her
countless
friends
who
*NL*
appreciate
her
splendid
labors
with
the
local
Red
Cross
realize
how
*NL*
valuable
she
will
be
to
any
war
board
with
which
she
chooses
to
become
*NL*
connected
.
Gopher
Prairie
thus
adds
another
shining
star
to
its
service
*NL*
flag
and
without
wishing
to
knock
any
neighboring
communities
,
we
would
*NL*
like
to
know
any
town
of
anywheres
near
our
size
in
the
state
that
has
*NL*
such
a
sterling
war
record

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
I
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
found
employment
in
the
Bureau
of
War
Risk
Insurance
.
Though
the
*NL*
armistice
with
Germany
was
signed
a
few
weeks
after
her
coming
to
*NL*
Washington
,
the
work
of
the
bureau
continued
.
She
filed
correspondence
*NL*
all
day
;
then
she
dictated
answers
to
letters
of
inquiry
.
It
was
an
*NL*
endurance
of
monotonous
details
,
yet
she
asserted
that
she
had
found
*NL*
``
real
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Disillusions
she
did
have
.
She
discovered
that
in
the
afternoon
,
office
*NL*
routine
stretches
to
the
grave
.
She
discovered
that
an
office
is
as
full
*NL*
of
cliques
and
scandals
as
a
Gopher
Prairie
.
She
discovered
that
most
*NL*
of
the
women
in
the
government
bureaus
lived
unhealthfully
,
dining
*NL*
on
snatches
in
their
crammed
apartments
.
But
she
also
discovered
that
*NL*
business
women
may
have
friendships
and
enmities
as
frankly
as
men
and
*NL*
may
revel
in
a
bliss
which
no
housewife
attains
--
a
free
Sunday
.
It
did
*NL*
not
appear
that
the
Great
World
needed
her
inspiration
,
but
she
felt
*NL*
that
her
letters
,
her
contact
with
the
anxieties
of
men
and
women
all
*NL*
over
the
country
,
were
a
part
of
vast
affairs
,
not
confined
to
Main
*NL*
Street
and
a
kitchen
but
linked
with
Paris
,
Bangkok
,
Madrid
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
perceived
that
she
could
do
office
work
without
losing
any
of
the
*NL*
putative
feminine
virtue
of
domesticity
;
that
cooking
and
cleaning
,
when
*NL*
divested
of
the
fussing
of
an
Aunt
Bessie
,
take
but
a
tenth
of
the
time
*NL*
which
,
in
a
Gopher
Prairie
,
it
is
but
decent
to
devote
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
to
have
to
apologize
for
her
thoughts
to
the
Jolly
Seventeen
,
not
to
*NL*
have
to
report
to
Kennicott
at
the
end
of
the
day
all
that
she
had
done
*NL*
or
might
do
,
was
a
relief
which
made
up
for
the
office
weariness
.
She
*NL*
felt
that
she
was
no
longer
one-half
of
a
marriage
but
the
whole
of
a
*NL*
human
being
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Washington
gave
her
all
the
graciousness
in
which
she
had
had
faith
:
*NL*
white
columns
seen
across
leafy
parks
,
spacious
avenues
,
twisty
alleys
.
*NL*
Daily
she
passed
a
dark
square
house
with
a
hint
of
magnolias
and
a
*NL*
courtyard
behind
it
,
and
a
tall
curtained
second-story
window
through
*NL*
which
a
woman
was
always
peering
.
The
woman
was
mystery
,
romance
,
a
*NL*
story
which
told
itself
differently
every
day
;
now
she
was
a
murderess
,
*NL*
now
the
neglected
wife
of
an
ambassador
.
It
was
mystery
which
Carol
had
*NL*
most
lacked
in
Gopher
Prairie
,
where
every
house
was
open
to
view
,
where
*NL*
every
person
was
but
too
easy
to
meet
,
where
there
were
no
secret
gates
*NL*
opening
upon
moors
over
which
one
might
walk
by
moss-deadened
paths
to
*NL*
strange
high
adventures
in
an
ancient
garden
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
flitted
up
Sixteenth
Street
after
a
Kreisler
recital
,
given
late
*NL*
in
the
afternoon
for
the
government
clerks
,
as
the
lamps
kindled
in
*NL*
spheres
of
soft
fire
,
as
the
breeze
flowed
into
the
street
,
fresh
*NL*
as
prairie
winds
and
kindlier
,
as
she
glanced
up
the
elm
alley
of
*NL*
Massachusetts
Avenue
,
as
she
was
rested
by
the
integrity
of
the
Scottish
*NL*
Rite
Temple
,
she
loved
the
city
as
she
loved
no
one
save
Hugh
.
She
*NL*
encountered
negro
shanties
turned
into
studios
,
with
orange
curtains
and
*NL*
pots
of
mignonette
;
marble
houses
on
New
Hampshire
Avenue
,
with
*NL*
butlers
and
limousines
;
and
men
who
looked
like
fictional
explorers
and
*NL*
aviators
.
Her
days
were
swift
,
and
she
knew
that
in
her
folly
of
running
*NL*
away
she
had
found
the
courage
to
be
wise
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
a
dispiriting
first
month
of
hunting
lodgings
in
the
crowded
*NL*
city
.
She
had
to
roost
in
a
hall-room
in
a
moldy
mansion
conducted
by
an
*NL*
indignant
decayed
gentlewoman
,
and
leave
Hugh
to
the
care
of
a
doubtful
*NL*
nurse
.
But
later
she
made
a
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Her
first
acquaintances
were
the
members
of
the
Tincomb
Methodist
*NL*
Church
,
a
vast
red-brick
tabernacle
.
Vida
Sherwin
had
given
her
a
letter
*NL*
to
an
earnest
woman
with
eye-glasses
,
plaid
silk
waist
,
and
a
belief
in
*NL*
Bible
Classes
,
who
introduced
her
to
the
Pastor
and
the
Nicer
Members
*NL*
of
Tincomb
.
Carol
recognized
in
Washington
as
she
had
in
California
a
*NL*
transplanted
and
guarded
Main
Street
.
Two-thirds
of
the
church-members
*NL*
had
come
from
Gopher
Prairies
.
The
church
was
their
society
and
*NL*
their
standard
;
they
went
to
Sunday
service
,
Sunday
School
,
Christian
*NL*
Endeavor
,
missionary
lectures
,
church
suppers
,
precisely
as
they
had
at
*NL*
home
;
they
agreed
that
ambassadors
and
flippant
newspapermen
and
infidel
*NL*
scientists
of
the
bureaus
were
equally
wicked
and
to
be
avoided
;
and
*NL*
by
cleaving
to
Tincomb
Church
they
kept
their
ideals
from
all
*NL*
contamination
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
welcomed
Carol
,
asked
about
her
husband
,
gave
her
advice
regarding
*NL*
colic
in
babies
,
passed
her
the
gingerbread
and
scalloped
potatoes
at
*NL*
church
suppers
,
and
in
general
made
her
very
unhappy
and
lonely
,
so
*NL*
that
she
wondered
if
she
might
not
enlist
in
the
militant
suffrage
*NL*
organization
and
be
allowed
to
go
to
jail
.
*NL*
*NL*
Always
she
was
to
perceive
in
Washington
-LRB-
as
doubtless
she
would
have
*NL*
perceived
in
New
York
or
London
-RRB-
a
thick
streak
of
Main
Street
.
The
*NL*
cautious
dullness
of
a
Gopher
Prairie
appeared
in
boarding-houses
where
*NL*
ladylike
bureau-clerks
gossiped
to
polite
young
army
officers
about
*NL*
the
movies
;
a
thousand
Sam
Clarks
and
a
few
Widow
Bogarts
were
to
be
*NL*
identified
in
the
Sunday
motor
procession
,
in
theater
parties
,
and
*NL*
at
the
dinners
of
State
Societies
,
to
which
the
emigres
from
Texas
or
*NL*
Michigan
surged
that
they
might
confirm
themselves
in
the
faith
that
*NL*
their
several
Gopher
Prairies
were
notoriously
``
a
whole
lot
peppier
and
*NL*
chummier
than
this
stuck-up
East
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
found
a
Washington
which
did
not
cleave
to
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
Guy
Pollock
wrote
to
a
cousin
,
a
temporary
army
captain
,
a
confiding
and
*NL*
buoyant
lad
who
took
Carol
to
tea-dances
,
and
laughed
,
as
she
had
always
*NL*
wanted
some
one
to
laugh
,
about
nothing
in
particular
.
The
captain
*NL*
introduced
her
to
the
secretary
of
a
congressman
,
a
cynical
young
widow
*NL*
with
many
acquaintances
in
the
navy
.
Through
her
Carol
met
commanders
*NL*
and
majors
,
newspapermen
,
chemists
and
geographers
and
fiscal
experts
*NL*
from
the
bureaus
,
and
a
teacher
who
was
a
familiar
of
the
militant
*NL*
suffrage
headquarters
.
The
teacher
took
her
to
headquarters
.
Carol
never
*NL*
became
a
prominent
suffragist
.
Indeed
her
only
recognized
position
was
*NL*
as
an
able
addresser
of
envelopes
.
But
she
was
casually
adopted
by
*NL*
this
family
of
friendly
women
who
,
when
they
were
not
being
mobbed
or
*NL*
arrested
,
took
dancing
lessons
or
went
picnicking
up
the
Chesapeake
*NL*
Canal
or
talked
about
the
politics
of
the
American
Federation
of
Labor
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
congressman
's
secretary
and
the
teacher
Carol
leased
a
small
*NL*
flat
.
Here
she
found
home
,
her
own
place
and
her
own
people
.
She
had
,
*NL*
though
it
absorbed
most
of
her
salary
,
an
excellent
nurse
for
Hugh
.
She
*NL*
herself
put
him
to
bed
and
played
with
him
on
holidays
.
There
were
*NL*
walks
with
him
,
there
were
motionless
evenings
of
reading
,
but
chiefly
*NL*
Washington
was
associated
with
people
,
scores
of
them
,
sitting
about
the
*NL*
flat
,
talking
,
talking
,
talking
,
not
always
wisely
but
always
excitedly
.
*NL*
It
was
not
at
all
the
``
artist
's
studio
''
of
which
,
because
of
its
*NL*
persistence
in
fiction
,
she
had
dreamed
.
Most
of
them
were
in
offices
*NL*
all
day
,
and
thought
more
in
card-catalogues
or
statistics
than
in
mass
*NL*
and
color
.
But
they
played
,
very
simply
,
and
they
saw
no
reason
why
*NL*
anything
which
exists
can
not
also
be
acknowledged
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
sometimes
shocked
quite
as
she
had
shocked
Gopher
Prairie
by
*NL*
these
girls
with
their
cigarettes
and
elfish
knowledge
.
When
they
were
*NL*
most
eager
about
soviets
or
canoeing
,
she
listened
,
longed
to
have
*NL*
some
special
learning
which
would
distinguish
her
,
and
sighed
that
her
*NL*
adventure
had
come
so
late
.
Kennicott
and
Main
Street
had
drained
*NL*
her
self-reliance
;
the
presence
of
Hugh
made
her
feel
temporary
.
Some
*NL*
day
--
oh
,
she
'd
have
to
take
him
back
to
open
fields
and
the
right
to
*NL*
climb
about
hay-lofts
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
fact
that
she
could
never
be
eminent
among
these
scoffing
*NL*
enthusiasts
did
not
keep
her
from
being
proud
of
them
,
from
defending
*NL*
them
in
imaginary
conversations
with
Kennicott
,
who
grunted
-LRB-
she
could
*NL*
hear
his
voice
-RRB-
,
``
They
're
simply
a
bunch
of
wild
impractical
theorists
*NL*
sittin
'
round
chewing
the
rag
,
''
and
``
I
have
n't
got
the
time
to
chase
*NL*
after
a
lot
of
these
fool
fads
;
I
'm
too
busy
putting
aside
a
stake
for
*NL*
our
old
age
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Most
of
the
men
who
came
to
the
flat
,
whether
they
were
army
officers
or
*NL*
radicals
who
hated
the
army
,
had
the
easy
gentleness
,
the
acceptance
*NL*
of
women
without
embarrassed
banter
,
for
which
she
had
longed
in
Gopher
*NL*
Prairie
.
Yet
they
seemed
to
be
as
efficient
as
the
Sam
Clarks
.
She
*NL*
concluded
that
it
was
because
they
were
of
secure
reputation
,
not
hemmed
*NL*
in
by
the
fire
of
provincial
jealousies
.
Kennicott
had
asserted
that
the
*NL*
villager
's
lack
of
courtesy
is
due
to
his
poverty
.
``
We
're
no
millionaire
*NL*
dudes
,
''
he
boasted
.
Yet
these
army
and
navy
men
,
these
bureau
experts
,
*NL*
and
organizers
of
multitudinous
leagues
,
were
cheerful
on
three
or
four
*NL*
thousand
a
year
,
while
Kennicott
had
,
outside
of
his
land
speculations
,
*NL*
six
thousand
or
more
,
and
Sam
had
eight
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nor
could
she
upon
inquiry
learn
that
many
of
this
reckless
race
died
in
*NL*
the
poorhouse
.
That
institution
is
reserved
for
men
like
Kennicott
who
,
*NL*
after
devoting
fifty
years
to
``
putting
aside
a
stake
,
''
incontinently
*NL*
invest
the
stake
in
spurious
oil-stocks
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
encouraged
to
believe
that
she
had
not
been
abnormal
in
viewing
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
as
unduly
tedious
and
slatternly
.
She
found
the
same
*NL*
faith
not
only
in
girls
escaped
from
domesticity
but
also
in
demure
*NL*
old
ladies
who
,
tragically
deprived
of
esteemed
husbands
and
huge
old
*NL*
houses
,
yet
managed
to
make
a
very
comfortable
thing
of
it
by
living
in
*NL*
small
flats
and
having
time
to
read
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
she
also
learned
that
by
comparison
Gopher
Prairie
was
a
model
of
*NL*
daring
color
,
clever
planning
,
and
frenzied
intellectuality
.
From
her
*NL*
teacher-housemate
she
had
a
sardonic
description
of
a
Middlewestern
*NL*
railroad-division
town
,
of
the
same
size
as
Gopher
Prairie
but
devoid
*NL*
of
lawns
and
trees
,
a
town
where
the
tracks
sprawled
along
the
*NL*
cinder-scabbed
Main
Street
,
and
the
railroad
shops
,
dripping
soot
from
*NL*
eaves
and
doorway
,
rolled
out
smoke
in
greasy
coils
.
*NL*
*NL*
Other
towns
she
came
to
know
by
anecdote
:
a
prairie
village
where
the
*NL*
wind
blew
all
day
long
,
and
the
mud
was
two
feet
thick
in
spring
,
and
in
*NL*
summer
the
flying
sand
scarred
new-painted
houses
and
dust
covered
*NL*
the
few
flowers
set
out
in
pots
.
New
England
mill-towns
with
the
hands
*NL*
living
in
rows
of
cottages
like
blocks
of
lava
.
A
rich
farming-center
*NL*
in
New
Jersey
,
off
the
railroad
,
furiously
pious
,
ruled
by
old
men
,
*NL*
unbelievably
ignorant
old
men
,
sitting
about
the
grocery
talking
of
*NL*
James
G.
Blaine
.
A
Southern
town
,
full
of
the
magnolias
and
white
*NL*
columns
which
Carol
had
accepted
as
proof
of
romance
,
but
hating
the
*NL*
negroes
,
obsequious
to
the
Old
Families
.
A
Western
mining-settlement
*NL*
like
a
tumor
.
A
booming
semi-city
with
parks
and
clever
architects
,
*NL*
visited
by
famous
pianists
and
unctuous
lecturers
,
but
irritable
from
a
*NL*
struggle
between
union
labor
and
the
manufacturers
'
association
,
so
*NL*
that
in
even
the
gayest
of
the
new
houses
there
was
a
ceaseless
and
*NL*
intimidating
heresy-hunt
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
chart
which
plots
Carol
's
progress
is
not
easy
to
read
.
The
lines
*NL*
are
broken
and
uncertain
of
direction
;
often
instead
of
rising
they
sink
*NL*
in
wavering
scrawls
;
and
the
colors
are
watery
blue
and
pink
and
the
dim
*NL*
gray
of
rubbed
pencil
marks
.
A
few
lines
are
traceable
.
*NL*
*NL*
Unhappy
women
are
given
to
protecting
their
sensitiveness
by
cynical
*NL*
gossip
,
by
whining
,
by
high-church
and
new-thought
religions
,
or
by
*NL*
a
fog
of
vagueness
.
Carol
had
hidden
in
none
of
these
refuges
from
*NL*
reality
,
but
she
,
who
was
tender
and
merry
,
had
been
made
timorous
by
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
.
Even
her
flight
had
been
but
the
temporary
courage
of
*NL*
panic
.
The
thing
she
gained
in
Washington
was
not
information
about
*NL*
office-systems
and
labor
unions
but
renewed
courage
,
that
amiable
*NL*
contempt
called
poise
.
Her
glimpse
of
tasks
involving
millions
of
people
*NL*
and
a
score
of
nations
reduced
Main
Street
from
bloated
importance
to
*NL*
its
actual
pettiness
.
She
could
never
again
be
quite
so
awed
by
the
*NL*
power
with
which
she
herself
had
endowed
the
Vidas
and
Blaussers
and
*NL*
Bogarts
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
her
work
and
from
her
association
with
women
who
had
organized
*NL*
suffrage
associations
in
hostile
cities
,
or
had
defended
political
*NL*
prisoners
,
she
caught
something
of
an
impersonal
attitude
;
saw
that
she
*NL*
had
been
as
touchily
personal
as
Maud
Dyer
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
why
,
she
began
to
ask
,
did
she
rage
at
individuals
?
Not
individuals
*NL*
but
institutions
are
the
enemies
,
and
they
most
afflict
the
disciples
*NL*
who
the
most
generously
serve
them
.
They
insinuate
their
tyranny
under
*NL*
a
hundred
guises
and
pompous
names
,
such
as
Polite
Society
,
the
Family
,
*NL*
the
Church
,
Sound
Business
,
the
Party
,
the
Country
,
the
Superior
White
*NL*
Race
;
and
the
only
defense
against
them
,
Carol
beheld
,
is
unembittered
*NL*
laughter
.

CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
SHE
had
lived
in
Washington
for
a
year
.
She
was
tired
of
the
office
.
*NL*
It
was
tolerable
,
far
more
tolerable
than
housework
,
but
it
was
not
*NL*
adventurous
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
having
tea
and
cinnamon
toast
,
alone
at
a
small
round
table
on
*NL*
the
balcony
of
Rauscher
's
Confiserie
.
Four
debutantes
clattered
in
.
She
*NL*
had
felt
young
and
dissipated
,
had
thought
rather
well
of
her
black
and
*NL*
leaf-green
suit
,
but
as
she
watched
them
,
thin
of
ankle
,
soft
under
the
*NL*
chin
,
seventeen
or
eighteen
at
most
,
smoking
cigarettes
with
the
correct
*NL*
ennui
and
talking
of
``
bedroom
farces
''
and
their
desire
to
``
run
up
to
New
*NL*
York
and
see
something
racy
,
''
she
became
old
and
rustic
and
plain
,
and
*NL*
desirous
of
retreating
from
these
hard
brilliant
children
to
a
life
*NL*
easier
and
more
sympathetic
.
When
they
flickered
out
and
one
child
gave
*NL*
orders
to
a
chauffeur
,
Carol
was
not
a
defiant
philosopher
but
a
faded
*NL*
government
clerk
from
Gopher
Prairie
,
Minnesota
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
started
dejectedly
up
Connecticut
Avenue
.
She
stopped
,
her
heart
*NL*
stopped
.
Coming
toward
her
were
Harry
and
Juanita
Haydock
.
She
ran
to
*NL*
them
,
she
kissed
Juanita
,
while
Harry
confided
,
``
Had
n't
expected
to
come
*NL*
to
Washington
--
had
to
go
to
New
York
for
some
buying
--
did
n't
have
your
*NL*
address
along
--
just
got
in
this
morning
--
wondered
how
in
the
world
we
*NL*
could
get
hold
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
definitely
sorry
to
hear
that
they
were
to
leave
at
nine
that
*NL*
evening
,
and
she
clung
to
them
as
long
as
she
could
.
She
took
them
to
*NL*
St.
Mark
's
for
dinner
.
Stooped
,
her
elbows
on
the
table
,
she
heard
*NL*
with
excitement
that
``
Cy
Bogart
had
the
`
flu
,
but
of
course
he
was
too
*NL*
gol-darn
mean
to
die
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
wrote
me
that
Mr.
Blausser
has
gone
away
.
How
did
he
get
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fine
!
Fine
!
Great
loss
to
the
town
.
There
was
a
real
public-spirited
*NL*
fellow
,
all
right
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
discovered
that
she
now
had
no
opinions
whatever
about
Mr.
Blausser
,
*NL*
and
she
said
sympathetically
,
``
Will
you
keep
up
the
town-boosting
*NL*
campaign
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Harry
fumbled
,
``
Well
,
we
've
dropped
it
just
temporarily
,
but
--
sure
you
*NL*
bet
!
Say
,
did
the
doc
write
you
about
the
luck
B.
J.
Gougerling
had
*NL*
hunting
ducks
down
in
Texas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
news
had
been
told
and
their
enthusiasm
had
slackened
she
*NL*
looked
about
and
was
proud
to
be
able
to
point
out
a
senator
,
to
explain
*NL*
the
cleverness
of
the
canopied
garden
.
She
fancied
that
a
man
with
*NL*
dinner-coat
and
waxed
mustache
glanced
superciliously
at
Harry
's
highly
*NL*
form-fitting
bright-brown
suit
and
Juanita
's
tan
silk
frock
,
which
was
*NL*
doubtful
at
the
seams
.
She
glared
back
,
defending
her
own
,
daring
the
*NL*
world
not
to
appreciate
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Then
,
waving
to
them
,
she
lost
them
down
the
long
train
shed
.
She
stood
*NL*
reading
the
list
of
stations
:
Harrisburg
,
Pittsburg
,
Chicago
.
Beyond
*NL*
Chicago
--
?
She
saw
the
lakes
and
stubble
fields
,
heard
the
rhythm
*NL*
of
insects
and
the
creak
of
a
buggy
,
was
greeted
by
Sam
Clark
's
``
Well
,
*NL*
well
,
how
's
the
little
lady
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
in
Washington
cared
enough
for
her
to
fret
about
her
sins
as
Sam
*NL*
did
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
that
night
they
had
at
the
flat
a
man
just
back
from
Finland
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
on
the
Powhatan
roof
with
the
captain
.
At
a
table
,
somewhat
*NL*
vociferously
buying
improbable
``
soft
drinks
''
for
two
fluffy
girls
,
was
a
*NL*
man
with
a
large
familiar
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
think
I
know
him
,
''
she
murmured
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Who
?
There
?
Oh
,
Bresnahan
,
Percy
Bresnahan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
You
've
met
him
?
What
sort
of
a
man
is
he
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
a
good-hearted
idiot
.
I
rather
like
him
,
and
I
believe
that
as
a
*NL*
salesman
of
motors
he
's
a
wonder
.
But
he
's
a
nuisance
in
the
aeronautic
*NL*
section
.
Tries
so
hard
to
be
useful
but
he
does
n't
know
anything
--
he
*NL*
does
n't
know
anything
.
Rather
pathetic
:
rich
man
poking
around
and
*NL*
trying
to
be
useful
.
Do
you
want
to
speak
to
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
--
no

I
do
n't
think
so

III

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
a
motion-picture
show
.
The
film
was
a
highly
advertised
*NL*
and
abysmal
thing
smacking
of
simpering
hair-dressers
,
cheap
perfume
,
*NL*
red-plush
suites
on
the
back
streets
of
tenderloins
,
and
complacent
fat
*NL*
women
chewing
gum
.
It
pretended
to
deal
with
the
life
of
studios
.
The
*NL*
leading
man
did
a
portrait
which
was
a
masterpiece
.
He
also
saw
visions
*NL*
in
pipe-smoke
,
and
was
very
brave
and
poor
and
pure
.
He
had
ringlets
,
*NL*
and
his
masterpiece
was
strangely
like
an
enlarged
photograph
.
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
prepared
to
leave
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
screen
,
in
the
role
of
a
composer
,
appeared
an
actor
called
Eric
*NL*
Valour
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
startled
,
incredulous
,
then
wretched
.
Looking
straight
out
at
*NL*
her
,
wearing
a
beret
and
a
velvet
jacket
,
was
Erik
Valborg
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
pale
part
,
which
he
played
neither
well
nor
badly
.
She
*NL*
speculated
,
``
I
could
have
made
so
much
of
him
--
''
She
did
not
finish
*NL*
her
speculation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
home
and
read
Kennicott
's
letters
.
They
had
seemed
stiff
and
*NL*
undetailed
,
but
now
there
strode
from
them
a
personality
,
a
personality
*NL*
unlike
that
of
the
languishing
young
man
in
the
velvet
jacket
playing
a
*NL*
dummy
piano
in
a
canvas
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
first
came
to
see
her
in
November
,
thirteen
months
after
her
*NL*
arrival
in
Washington
.
When
he
announced
that
he
was
coming
she
was
not
*NL*
at
all
sure
that
she
wished
to
see
him
.
She
was
glad
that
he
had
made
*NL*
the
decision
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
leave
from
the
office
for
two
days
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
watched
him
marching
from
the
train
,
solid
,
assured
,
carrying
his
*NL*
heavy
suit-case
,
and
she
was
diffident
--
he
was
such
a
bulky
person
to
*NL*
handle
.
They
kissed
each
other
questioningly
,
and
said
at
the
same
time
,
*NL*
``
You
're
looking
fine
;
how
's
the
baby
?
''
and
``
You
're
looking
awfully
well
,
*NL*
dear
;
how
is
everything
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
grumbled
,
``
I
do
n't
want
to
butt
in
on
any
plans
you
've
made
or
your
*NL*
friends
or
anything
,
but
if
you
've
got
time
for
it
,
I
'd
like
to
chase
*NL*
around
Washington
,
and
take
in
some
restaurants
and
shows
and
stuff
,
and
*NL*
forget
work
for
a
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
realized
,
in
the
taxicab
,
that
he
was
wearing
a
soft
gray
suit
,
a
*NL*
soft
easy
hat
,
a
flippant
tie
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Like
the
new
outfit
?
Got
'em
in
Chicago
.
Gosh
,
I
hope
they
're
the
kind
*NL*
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
spent
half
an
hour
at
the
flat
,
with
Hugh
.
She
was
flustered
,
but
*NL*
he
gave
no
sign
of
kissing
her
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
moved
about
the
small
rooms
she
realized
that
he
had
had
his
new
*NL*
tan
shoes
polished
to
a
brassy
luster
.
There
was
a
recent
cut
on
*NL*
his
chin
.
He
must
have
shaved
on
the
train
just
before
coming
into
*NL*
Washington
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
pleasant
to
feel
how
important
she
was
,
how
many
people
she
*NL*
recognized
,
as
she
took
him
to
the
Capitol
,
as
she
told
him
-LRB-
he
asked
*NL*
and
she
obligingly
guessed
-RRB-
how
many
feet
it
was
to
the
top
of
the
dome
,
*NL*
as
she
pointed
out
Senator
LaFollette
and
the
vice-president
,
and
*NL*
at
lunch-time
showed
herself
an
habitue
by
leading
him
through
the
*NL*
catacombs
to
the
senate
restaurant
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
realized
that
he
was
slightly
more
bald
.
The
familiar
way
in
which
*NL*
his
hair
was
parted
on
the
left
side
agitated
her
.
She
looked
down
*NL*
at
his
hands
,
and
the
fact
that
his
nails
were
as
ill-treated
as
ever
*NL*
touched
her
more
than
his
pleading
shoe-shine
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
'd
like
to
motor
down
to
Mount
Vernon
this
afternoon
,
would
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
she
said
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
one
thing
he
had
planned
.
He
was
delighted
that
it
seemed
to
*NL*
be
a
perfectly
well
bred
and
Washingtonian
thing
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
shyly
held
her
hand
on
the
way
,
and
told
her
the
news
:
they
were
*NL*
excavating
the
basement
for
the
new
schoolbuilding
,
Vida
``
made
him
tired
*NL*
the
way
she
always
looked
at
the
Maje
,
''
poor
Chet
Dashaway
had
been
*NL*
killed
in
a
motor
accident
out
on
the
Coast
.
He
did
not
coax
her
to
like
*NL*
him
.
At
Mount
Vernon
he
admired
the
paneled
library
and
Washington
's
*NL*
dental
tools
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
knew
that
he
would
want
oysters
,
that
he
would
have
heard
of
*NL*
Harvey
's
apropos
of
Grant
and
Blaine
,
and
she
took
him
there
.
At
dinner
*NL*
his
hearty
voice
,
his
holiday
enjoyment
of
everything
,
turned
into
*NL*
nervousness
in
his
desire
to
know
a
number
of
interesting
matters
,
such
*NL*
as
whether
they
still
were
married
.
But
he
did
not
ask
questions
,
and
*NL*
he
said
nothing
about
her
returning
.
He
cleared
his
throat
and
observed
,
*NL*
``
Oh
say
,
been
trying
out
the
old
camera
.
Do
n't
you
think
these
are
*NL*
pretty
good
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
tossed
over
to
her
thirty
prints
of
Gopher
Prairie
and
the
country
*NL*
about
.
Without
defense
,
she
was
thrown
into
it
.
She
remembered
that
he
*NL*
had
lured
her
with
photographs
in
courtship
days
;
she
made
a
note
of
*NL*
his
sameness
,
his
satisfaction
with
the
tactics
which
had
proved
good
*NL*
before
;
but
she
forgot
it
in
the
familiar
places
.
She
was
seeing
*NL*
the
sun-speckled
ferns
among
birches
on
the
shore
of
Minniemashie
,
*NL*
wind-rippled
miles
of
wheat
,
the
porch
of
their
own
house
where
Hugh
had
*NL*
played
,
Main
Street
where
she
knew
every
window
and
every
face
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
handed
them
back
,
with
praise
for
his
photography
,
and
he
talked
of
*NL*
lenses
and
time-exposures
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
over
and
they
were
gossiping
of
her
friends
at
the
flat
,
but
*NL*
an
intruder
was
with
them
,
sitting
back
,
persistent
,
inescapable
.
She
*NL*
could
not
endure
it
.
She
stammered
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
you
check
your
bag
at
the
station
because
I
was
n't
quite
sure
*NL*
where
you
'd
stay
.
I
'm
dreadfully
sorry
we
have
n't
room
to
put
you
up
at
*NL*
the
flat
.
We
ought
to
have
seen
about
a
room
for
you
before
.
Do
n't
you
*NL*
think
you
better
call
up
the
Willard
or
the
Washington
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
peered
at
her
cloudily
.
Without
words
he
asked
,
without
speech
she
*NL*
answered
,
whether
she
was
also
going
to
the
Willard
or
the
Washington
.
*NL*
But
she
tried
to
look
as
though
she
did
not
know
that
they
were
debating
*NL*
anything
of
the
sort
.
She
would
have
hated
him
had
he
been
meek
about
*NL*
it
.
But
he
was
neither
meek
nor
angry
.
However
impatient
he
may
have
*NL*
been
with
her
blandness
he
said
readily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
guess
I
better
do
that
.
Excuse
me
a
second
.
Then
how
about
*NL*
grabbing
a
taxi
-LRB-
Gosh
,
is
n't
it
the
limit
the
way
these
taxi
shuffers
*NL*
skin
around
a
corner
?
Got
more
nerve
driving
than
I
have
!
-RRB-
and
going
*NL*
up
to
your
flat
for
a
while
?
Like
to
meet
your
friends
--
must
be
fine
*NL*
women
--
and
I
might
take
a
look
and
see
how
Hugh
sleeps
.
Like
to
know
how
*NL*
he
breathes
.
Do
n't
think
he
has
adenoids
,
but
I
better
make
sure
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
He
patted
her
shoulder
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
the
flat
they
found
her
two
housemates
and
a
girl
who
had
been
to
*NL*
jail
for
suffrage
.
Kennicott
fitted
in
surprisingly
.
He
laughed
at
the
*NL*
girl
's
story
of
the
humors
of
a
hunger-strike
;
he
told
the
secretary
*NL*
what
to
do
when
her
eyes
were
tired
from
typing
;
and
the
teacher
asked
*NL*
him
--
not
as
the
husband
of
a
friend
but
as
a
physician
--
whether
there
*NL*
was
``
anything
to
this
inoculation
for
colds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
colloquialisms
seemed
to
Carol
no
more
lax
than
their
habitual
*NL*
slang
.
*NL*
*NL*
Like
an
older
brother
he
kissed
her
good-night
in
the
midst
of
the
*NL*
company
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
's
terribly
nice
,
''
said
her
housemates
,
and
waited
for
confidences
.
*NL*
They
got
none
,
nor
did
her
own
heart
.
She
could
find
nothing
definite
to
*NL*
agonize
about
.
She
felt
that
she
was
no
longer
analyzing
and
controlling
*NL*
forces
,
but
swept
on
by
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
to
the
flat
for
breakfast
,
and
washed
the
dishes
.
That
was
her
*NL*
only
occasion
for
spite
.
Back
home
he
never
thought
of
washing
dishes
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
took
him
to
the
obvious
``
sights
''
--
the
Treasury
,
the
Monument
,
the
*NL*
Corcoran
Gallery
,
the
Pan-American
Building
,
the
Lincoln
Memorial
,
with
*NL*
the
Potomac
beyond
it
and
the
Arlington
hills
and
the
columns
of
the
Lee
*NL*
Mansion
.
For
all
his
willingness
to
play
there
was
over
him
a
melancholy
*NL*
which
piqued
her
.
His
normally
expressionless
eyes
had
depths
to
them
*NL*
now
,
and
strangeness
.
As
they
walked
through
Lafayette
Square
,
looking
*NL*
past
the
Jackson
statue
at
the
lovely
tranquil
facade
of
the
White
*NL*
House
,
he
sighed
,
``
I
wish
I
'd
had
a
shot
at
places
like
this
.
When
I
was
*NL*
in
the
U.
,
I
had
to
earn
part
of
my
way
,
and
when
I
was
n't
doing
that
*NL*
or
studying
,
I
guess
I
was
roughhousing
.
My
gang
were
a
great
bunch
for
*NL*
bumming
around
and
raising
Cain
.
Maybe
if
I
'd
been
caught
early
and
*NL*
sent
to
concerts
and
all
that
--
Would
I
have
been
what
you
call
*NL*
intelligent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
my
dear
,
do
n't
be
humble
!
You
are
intelligent
!
For
instance
,
you
're
*NL*
the
most
thorough
doctor
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
edging
about
something
he
wished
to
say
.
He
pounced
on
it
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
did
like
those
pictures
of
G.
P.
pretty
well
,
after
all
,
did
n't
*NL*
you
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
of
course
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Would
n't
be
so
bad
to
have
a
glimpse
of
the
old
town
,
would
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
would
n't
.
Just
as
I
was
terribly
glad
to
see
the
Haydocks
.
*NL*
But
please
understand
me
!
That
does
n't
mean
that
I
withdraw
all
my
*NL*
criticisms
.
The
fact
that
I
might
like
a
glimpse
of
old
friends
has
n't
*NL*
any
particular
relation
to
the
question
of
whether
Gopher
Prairie
*NL*
ought
n't
to
have
festivals
and
lamb
chops
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Hastily
,
``
No
,
no
!
Sure
not
.
I
und
`
stand
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
know
it
must
have
been
pretty
tiresome
to
have
to
live
with
*NL*
anybody
as
perfect
as
I
was
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
grinned
.
She
liked
his
grin
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
V
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
thrilled
by
old
negro
coachmen
,
admirals
,
aeroplanes
,
the
*NL*
building
to
which
his
income
tax
would
eventually
go
,
a
Rolls-Royce
,
*NL*
Lynnhaven
oysters
,
the
Supreme
Court
Room
,
a
New
York
theatrical
manager
*NL*
down
for
the
try-out
of
a
play
,
the
house
where
Lincoln
died
,
the
cloaks
*NL*
of
Italian
officers
,
the
barrows
at
which
clerks
buy
their
box-lunches
*NL*
at
noon
,
the
barges
on
the
Chesapeake
Canal
,
and
the
fact
that
District
*NL*
of
Columbia
cars
had
both
District
and
Maryland
licenses
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
resolutely
took
him
to
her
favorite
white
and
green
cottages
and
*NL*
Georgian
houses
.
He
admitted
that
fanlights
,
and
white
shutters
against
*NL*
rosy
brick
,
were
more
homelike
than
a
painty
wooden
box
.
He
volunteered
,
*NL*
``
I
see
how
you
mean
.
They
make
me
think
of
these
pictures
of
an
*NL*
old-fashioned
Christmas
.
Oh
,
if
you
keep
at
it
long
enough
you
'll
have
*NL*
Sam
and
me
reading
poetry
and
everything
.
Oh
say
,
d'
I
tell
you
about
*NL*
this
fierce
green
Jack
Elder

had
his
machine
painted

VI

They
were
at
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
hinted
,
``
Before
you
showed
me
those
places
today
,
I
'd
already
made
up
*NL*
my
mind
that
when
I
built
the
new
house
we
used
to
talk
about
,
I
'd
fix
*NL*
it
the
way
you
wanted
it

I
'm
pretty
practical
about
foundations
and
*NL*
radiation
and
stuff
like
that
,
but
I
guess
I
do
n't
know
a
whole
lot
*NL*
about
architecture
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
it
occurs
to
me
with
a
sudden
shock

I
do
n't
either

*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

anyway

you
let
me
plan
the
garage

the
plumbing

and
you
do

the
rest

if
you
ever

I
mean

ever
want

Doubtfully

of

Look
here

She
gaped
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
been
a
whale
of
a
fight

I
guess
I
've
got
myself
to
see
that

you

ever
stand
G.

I
wo

I
just
want
you
to
know

how
I
wait

Every

I
look
for

when
I
get
one

I
'm
kind
of
scared
to

I
'm
hoping
so
much
that
you
're
coming
*NL*
back

Evenings
--
You
know
I
did
n't
open
the
cottage
down
at
the
lake
at
*NL*
all
,
this
past
summer
.
Simply
could
n't
stand
all
the
others
laughing
and
*NL*
swimming
,
and
you
not
there
.
I
used
to
sit
on
the
porch
,
in
town
,
and
*NL*
I
--
I
could
n't
get
over
the
feeling
that
you
'd
simply
run
up
to
the
drug
*NL*
store
and
would
be
right
back
,
and
till
after
it
got
dark
I
'd
catch
*NL*
myself
watching
,
looking
up
the
street
,
and
you
never
came
,
and
the
*NL*
house
was
so
empty
and
still
that
I
did
n't
like
to
go
in
.
And
sometimes
*NL*
I
fell
asleep
there
,
in
my
chair
,
and
did
n't
wake
up
till
after
*NL*
midnight
,
and
the
house
--
Oh
,
the
devil
!
Please
get
me
,
Carrie
.
I
just
*NL*
want
you
to
know
how
welcome
you
'll
be
if
you
ever
do
come

But
I

It
was
in
the
Villa
Margherita
,
by
the
palms
of
the
Charleston
Battery
*NL*
and
the
metallic
harbor
,
that
her
aloofness
melted
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
sat
on
the
upper
balcony
,
enchanted
by
the
moon
glitter
,
she
*NL*
cried
,
``
Shall
I
go
back

stare

take

time

it
over

''
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
relieved
.
She
still
had
a
chance
to
seize
splendid
indefinite
*NL*
freedoms
.
She
might
go
--
oh
,
she
'd
see
Europe
,
somehow
,
before
she
was
*NL*
recaptured
.
But
she
also
had
a
firmer
respect
for
Kennicott
.
She
had
*NL*
fancied
that
her
life
might
make
a
story
.
She
knew
that
there
was
*NL*
nothing
heroic
or
obviously
dramatic
in
it
,
no
magic
of
rare
hours
,
*NL*
nor
valiant
challenge
,
but
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
of
some
*NL*
significance
because
she
was
commonplaceness
,
the
ordinary
life
of
the
*NL*
age
,
made
articulate
and
protesting
.
It
had
not
occurred
to
her
that
*NL*
there
was
also
a
story
of
Will
Kennicott
,
into
which
she
entered
only
so
*NL*
much
as
he
entered
into
hers
;
that
he
had
bewilderments
and
concealments
*NL*
as
intricate
as
her
own
,
and
soft
treacherous
desires
for
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
she
brooded
,
looking
at
the
amazing
sea
,
holding
his
hand
.

*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
in
Washington
;
Kennicott
was
in
Gopher
Prairie
,
writing
as
dryly
*NL*
as
ever
about
water-pipes
and
goose-hunting
and
Mrs.
Fageros
's
mastoid
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
talking
at
dinner
to
a
generalissima
of
suffrage
.
Should
she
*NL*
return
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
leader
spoke
wearily
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
I
'm
perfectly
selfish
.
I
ca
n't
quite
visualize
the
needs
of
*NL*
your
husband
,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
your
baby
will
do
quite
as
well
in
*NL*
the
schools
here
as
in
your
barracks
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
think
I
'd
better
not
go
back
?
''
Carol
sounded
disappointed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
more
difficult
than
that
.
When
I
say
that
I
'm
selfish
I
mean
that
*NL*
the
only
thing
I
consider
about
women
is
whether
they
're
likely
to
prove
*NL*
useful
in
building
up
real
political
power
for
women
.
And
you
?
Shall
I
*NL*
be
frank
?
Remember
when
I
say
`
you
'
I
do
n't
mean
you
alone
.
I
'm
thinking
*NL*
of
thousands
of
women
who
come
to
Washington
and
New
York
and
*NL*
Chicago
every
year
,
dissatisfied
at
home
and
seeking
a
sign
in
the
*NL*
heavens
--
women
of
all
sorts
,
from
timid
mothers
of
fifty
in
cotton
*NL*
gloves
,
to
girls
just
out
of
Vassar
who
organize
strikes
in
their
own
*NL*
fathers
'
factories
!
All
of
you
are
more
or
less
useful
to
me
,
but
only
*NL*
a
few
of
you
can
take
my
place
,
because
I
have
one
virtue
-LRB-
only
one
-RRB-
:
I
*NL*
have
given
up
father
and
mother
and
children
for
the
love
of
God
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Here
's
the
test
for
you
:
Do
you
come
to
`
conquer
the
East
,
'
as
people
*NL*
say
,
or
do
you
come
to
conquer
yourself
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
's
so
much
more
complicated
than
any
of
you
know
--
so
much
more
*NL*
complicated
than
I
knew
when
I
put
on
Ground
Grippers
and
started
out
to
*NL*
reform
the
world
.
The
final
complication
in
`
conquering
Washington
'
or
*NL*
`
conquering
New
York
'
is
that
the
conquerors
must
beyond
all
things
not
*NL*
conquer
!
It
must
have
been
so
easy
in
the
good
old
days
when
authors
*NL*
dreamed
only
of
selling
a
hundred
thousand
volumes
,
and
sculptors
*NL*
of
being
feted
in
big
houses
,
and
even
the
Uplifters
like
me
had
a
*NL*
simple-hearted
ambition
to
be
elected
to
important
offices
and
invited
*NL*
to
go
round
lecturing
.
But
we
meddlers
have
upset
everything
.
Now
the
*NL*
one
thing
that
is
disgraceful
to
any
of
us
is
obvious
success
.
The
*NL*
Uplifter
who
is
very
popular
with
wealthy
patrons
can
be
pretty
sure
*NL*
that
he
has
softened
his
philosophy
to
please
them
,
and
the
author
who
*NL*
is
making
lots
of
money
--
poor
things
,
I
've
heard
'em
apologizing
for
it
*NL*
to
the
shabby
bitter-enders
;
I
've
seen
'em
ashamed
of
the
sleek
luggage
*NL*
they
got
from
movie
rights
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
want
to
sacrifice
yourself
in
such
a
topsy-turvy
world
,
where
*NL*
popularity
makes
you
unpopular
with
the
people
you
love
,
and
the
only
*NL*
failure
is
cheap
success
,
and
the
only
individualist
is
the
person
who
*NL*
gives
up
all
his
individualism
to
serve
a
jolly
ungrateful
proletariat
*NL*
which
thumbs
its
nose
at
him
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Carol
smiled
ingratiatingly
,
to
indicate
that
she
was
indeed
one
who
*NL*
desired
to
sacrifice
,
but
she
sighed
,
``
I
do
n't
know
;
I
'm
afraid
I
'm
not
*NL*
heroic

I
certainly
was

I
do

*NL*
``
Not
a

New
England

surface

in

the

There

one
attack

ask
why
it

who
first
laid
down
the
law

it
had
to
be
that

way

do
this
impolitely

twenty

so

two
hundred

friends
allow

Easy

pleasant
,
lucrative
home-work
for

asking

to
define
their

the
most
dangerous
doctrine

was
mediating

Though

should
return

she
said

she
would
not

She
was
glad
of
her
rebellion

The
prairie
was
no

empty
land
in

the
sun-glare
;
it
was
the
living
tawny
beast

fought

made
beautiful
by
fighting

in

*NL*
*NL*
Her
active
hatred
of
Gopher
Prairie
had
run
out

She
saw
it
now
as
a
*NL*
toiling
new
settlement

With
sympathy
she
remembered
Kennicott

defense

citizens
as

She
recalled
tenderly
the
*NL*
young
awkwardness
of
Main
Street
and
the
makeshifts
of
the
little
brown
*NL*
cottages
;
she
pitied
their
shabbiness
and
isolation
;
had
compassion
for
*NL*
their
assertion
of
culture
,
even
as
expressed
in
Thanatopsis
papers
,
for
*NL*
their
pretense
of
greatness
,
even
as
trumpeted
in
``
boosting

''
She
saw
*NL*
Main
Street
in
the
dusty
prairie
sunset
,
a
line
of
frontier
shanties
*NL*
with
solemn
lonely
people
waiting
for
her
,
solemn
and
lonely
as
an
old

man
who
has
outlived
his

She
remembered
that
Kennicott

Sam

Clark
had
listened

sing

love
it

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
,
perhaps
,
rather
proud
of
herself
for
having
acquired
so
much
*NL*
tolerance
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
awoke
at
three
in
the
morning
,
after
a
dream
of
being
tortured
by

Ella
Stowbody
and
the
Widow
Bogart
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
've

making

the

sunset

rimmed
round
with
splendor

much
that
she
had
every
sensation
she
had
imagined
.
She
was
*NL*
excited
by
each
familiar
porch
,
each
hearty
``
Well
,
well
!
''
and
flattered
*NL*
to
be
,
for
a
day
,
the
most
important
news
of
the
community
.
She
bustled
*NL*
about
,
making
calls
.
Juanita
Haydock
bubbled
over
their
Washington
*NL*
encounter
,
and
took
Carol
to
her
social
bosom
.
This
ancient
opponent
*NL*
seemed
likely
to
be
her
most
intimate
friend
,
for
Vida
Sherwin
,
though
*NL*
she
was
cordial
,
stood
back
and
watched
for
imported
heresies
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
Carol
went
to
the
mill
.
The
mystical
Om-Om-Om
of
the
*NL*
dynamos
in
the
electric-light
plant
behind
the
mill
was
louder
in
the
*NL*
darkness
.
Outside
sat
the
night
watchman
,
Champ
Perry
.
He
held
up
his
*NL*
stringy
hands
and
squeaked
,
``
We
've
all
missed
you
terrible
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Who
in
Washington
would
miss
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
Who
in
Washington
could
be
depended
upon
like
Guy
Pollock
?
When
she
saw
*NL*
him
on
the
street
,
smiling
as
always
,
he
seemed
an
eternal
thing
,
a
part
*NL*
of
her
own
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
week
she
decided
that
she
was
neither
glad
nor
sorry
to
be
back
.
*NL*
She
entered
each
day
with
the
matter-of-fact
attitude
with
which
she
*NL*
had
gone
to
her
office
in
Washington
.
It
was
her
task
;
there
would
be
*NL*
mechanical
details
and
meaningless
talk
;
what
of
it
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
problem
which
she
had
approached
with
emotion
proved
*NL*
insignificant
.
She
had
,
on
the
train
,
worked
herself
up
to
such
devotion
*NL*
that
she
was
willing
to
give
up
her
own
room
,
to
try
to
share
all
of
her
*NL*
life
with
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
mumbled
,
ten
minutes
after
she
had
entered
the
house
,
``
Say
,
I
've
kept
*NL*
your
room
for
you
like
it
was
.
I
've
kind
of
come
round
to
your
way
of
*NL*
thinking
.
Do
n't
see
why
folks
need
to
get
on
each
other
's
nerves
just
*NL*
because
they
're
friendly
.
Darned
if
I
have
n't
got
so
I
like
a
little
*NL*
privacy
and
mulling
things
over
by
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
II
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
left
a
city
which
sat
up
nights
to
talk
of
universal
transition
;
*NL*
of
European
revolution
,
guild
socialism
,
free
verse
.
She
had
fancied
*NL*
that
all
the
world
was
changing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
that
it
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
Gopher
Prairie
the
only
ardent
new
topics
were
prohibition
,
the
place
*NL*
in
Minneapolis
where
you
could
get
whisky
at
thirteen
dollars
a
quart
,
*NL*
recipes
for
home-made
beer
,
the
``
high
cost
of
living
,
''
the
presidential
*NL*
election
,
Clark
's
new
car
,
and
not
very
novel
foibles
of
Cy
Bogart
.
*NL*
Their
problems
were
exactly
what
they
had
been
two
years
ago
,
what
they
*NL*
had
been
twenty
years
ago
,
and
what
they
would
be
for
twenty
years
to
*NL*
come
.
With
the
world
a
possible
volcano
,
the
husbandmen
were
plowing
at
*NL*
the
base
of
the
mountain
.
A
volcano
does
occasionally
drop
a
river
*NL*
of
lava
on
even
the
best
of
agriculturists
,
to
their
astonishment
and
*NL*
considerable
injury
,
but
their
cousins
inherit
the
farms
and
a
year
or
*NL*
two
later
go
back
to
the
plowing
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
unable
to
rhapsodize
much
over
the
seven
new
bungalows
and
the
*NL*
two
garages
which
Kennicott
had
made
to
seem
so
important
.
Her
intensest
*NL*
thought
about
them
was
,
``
Oh
yes
,
they
're
all
right
I
suppose
.
''
The
*NL*
change
which
she
did
heed
was
the
erection
of
the
schoolbuilding
,
with
*NL*
its
cheerful
brick
walls
,
broad
windows
,
gymnasium
,
classrooms
for
*NL*
agriculture
and
cooking
.
It
indicated
Vida
's
triumph
,
and
it
stirred
her
*NL*
to
activity
--
any
activity
.
She
went
to
Vida
with
a
jaunty
,
``
I
think
I
*NL*
shall
work
for
you
.
And
I
'll
begin
at
the
bottom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
did
.
She
relieved
the
attendant
at
the
rest-room
for
an
hour
a
*NL*
day
.
Her
only
innovation
was
painting
the
pine
table
a
black
and
orange
*NL*
rather
shocking
to
the
Thanatopsis
.
She
talked
to
the
farmwives
and
*NL*
soothed
their
babies
and
was
happy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thinking
of
them
she
did
not
think
of
the
ugliness
of
Main
Street
as
she
*NL*
hurried
along
it
to
the
chatter
of
the
Jolly
Seventeen
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
wore
her
eye-glasses
on
the
street
now
.
She
was
beginning
to
ask
*NL*
Kennicott
and
Juanita
if
she
did
n't
look
young
,
much
younger
than
*NL*
thirty-three
.
The
eye-glasses
pinched
her
nose
.
She
considered
*NL*
spectacles
.
They
would
make
her
seem
older
,
and
hopelessly
settled
.
*NL*
No
!
She
would
not
wear
spectacles
yet
.
But
she
tried
on
a
pair
at
*NL*
Kennicott
's
office
.
They
really
were
much
more
comfortable
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
III
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Westlake
,
Sam
Clark
,
Nat
Hicks
,
and
Del
Snafflin
were
talking
in
*NL*
Del
's
barber
shop
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
see
Kennicott
's
wife
is
taking
a
whirl
at
the
rest-room
,
now
,
''
*NL*
said
Dr.
Westlake
.
He
emphasized
the
``
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Del
interrupted
the
shaving
of
Sam
and
,
with
his
brush
dripping
lather
,
*NL*
he
observed
jocularly
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
'll
she
be
up
to
next
?
They
say
she
used
to
claim
this
burg
was
n't
*NL*
swell
enough
for
a
city
girl
like
her
,
and
would
we
please
tax
ourselves
*NL*
about
thirty-seven
point
nine
and
fix
it
all
up
pretty
,
with
tidies
on
*NL*
the
hydrants
and
statoos
on
the
lawns
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
irritably
blew
the
lather
from
his
lips
,
with
milky
small
bubbles
,
*NL*
and
snorted
,
``
Be
a
good
thing
for
most
of
us
roughnecks
if
we
did
have
*NL*
a
smart
woman
to
tell
us
how
to
fix
up
the
town
.
Just
as
much
to
her
*NL*
kicking
as
there
was
to
Jim
Blausser
's
gassing
about
factories
.
And
you
*NL*
can
bet
Mrs.
Kennicott
is
smart
,
even
if
she
is
skittish
.
Glad
to
see
*NL*
her
back
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Dr.
Westlake
hastened
to
play
safe
.
``
So
was
I
!
So
was
I
!
She
's
got
a
*NL*
nice
way
about
her
,
and
she
knows
a
good
deal
about
books
,
or
fiction
*NL*
anyway
.
Of
course
she
's
like
all
the
rest
of
these
women
--
not
*NL*
solidly
founded
--
not
scholarly
--
does
n't
know
anything
about
political
*NL*
economy
--
falls
for
every
new
idea
that
some
windjamming
crank
puts
out
.
*NL*
But
she
's
a
nice
woman
.
She
'll
probably
fix
up
the
rest-room
,
and
the
*NL*
rest-room
is
a
fine
thing
,
brings
a
lot
of
business
to
town
.
And
now
*NL*
that
Mrs.
Kennicott
's
been
away
,
maybe
she
's
got
over
some
of
her
fool
*NL*
ideas
.
Maybe
she
realizes
that
folks
simply
laugh
at
her
when
she
tries
*NL*
to
tell
us
how
to
run
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
She
'll
take
a
tumble
to
herself
,
''
said
Nat
Hicks
,
sucking
in
*NL*
his
lips
judicially
.
``
As
far
as
I
'm
concerned
,
I
'll
say
she
's
as
nice
a
*NL*
looking
skirt
as
there
is
in
town
.
But
yow
!
''
His
tone
electrified
them
.
*NL*
``
Guess
she
'll
miss
that
Swede
Valborg
that
used
to
work
for
me
!
They
was
*NL*
a
pair
!
Talking
poetry
and
moonshine
!
If
they
could
of

away
with
it
,
*NL*
they
'd

been
so
darn
lovey-dovey

''
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
Clark
interrupted
,
``
Rats
,
they
never
even
thought
about
making
love

*NL*
Just
talking
books

all
that
junk

I
tell
you
,
Carrie
Kennicott
's
*NL*
a
smart
woman
,
and
these
smart
educated
women
all
get
funny
ideas
,
but
*NL*
they
get
over
'em
after
they
've
had
three
or
four
kids
.
You
'll
see
her
*NL*
settled
down
one
of
these
days
,
and
teaching
Sunday
School
and
helping
*NL*
at
sociables
and
behaving
herself
,
and
not
trying
to
butt
into
business
*NL*
and
politics
.
Sure
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
only
fifteen
minutes
of
conference
on
her
stockings
,
her
son
,
her
*NL*
separate
bedroom
,
her
music
,
her
ancient
interest
in
Guy
Pollock
,
her
*NL*
probable
salary
in
Washington
,
and
every
remark
which
she
was
known
to
*NL*
have
made
since
her
return
,
the
supreme
council
decided
that
they
would
*NL*
permit
Carol
Kennicott
to
live
,
and
they
passed
on
to
a
consideration
of
*NL*
Nat
Hicks
's
New
One
about
the
traveling
salesman
and
the
old
maid
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
IV
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
For
some
reason
which
was
totally
mysterious
to
Carol
,
Maud
Dyer
seemed
*NL*
to
resent
her
return
.
At
the
Jolly
Seventeen
Maud
giggled
nervously
,
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
suppose
you
found
war-work
a
good
excuse
to
stay
away
and
have
*NL*
a
swell
time
.
Juanita
!
Do
n't
you
think
we
ought
to
make
Carrie
tell
us
*NL*
about
the
officers
she
met
in
Washington
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
rustled
and
stared
.
Carol
looked
at
them
.
Their
curiosity
seemed
*NL*
natural
and
unimportant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
yes
indeed
,
have
to
do
that
some
day
,
''
she
yawned
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
no
longer
took
Aunt
Bessie
Smail
seriously
enough
to
struggle
for
*NL*
independence
.
She
saw
that
Aunt
Bessie
did
not
mean
to
intrude
;
that
*NL*
she
wanted
to
do
things
for
all
the
Kennicotts
.
Thus
Carol
hit
upon
the
*NL*
tragedy
of
old
age
,
which
is
not
that
it
is
less
vigorous
than
youth
,
*NL*
but
that
it
is
not
needed
by
youth
;
that
its
love
and
prosy
sageness
,
*NL*
so
important
a
few
years
ago
,
so
gladly
offered
now
,
are
rejected
*NL*
with
laughter
.
She
divined
that
when
Aunt
Bessie
came
in
with
a
jar
of
*NL*
wild-grape
jelly
she
was
waiting
in
hope
of
being
asked
for
the
recipe
.
*NL*
After
that
she
could
be
irritated
but
she
could
not
be
depressed
by
Aunt
*NL*
Bessie
's
simoom
of
questioning
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
n't
depressed
even
when
she
heard
Mrs.
Bogart
observe
,
``
Now
we
've
*NL*
got
prohibition
it
seems
to
me
that
the
next
problem
of
the
country
*NL*
ai
n't
so
much
abolishing
cigarettes
as
it
is
to
make
folks
observe
the
*NL*
Sabbath
and
arrest
these
law-breakers
that
play
baseball
and
go
to
the
*NL*
movies
and
all
on
the
Lord
's
Day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Only
one
thing
bruised
Carol
's
vanity
.
Few
people
asked
her
about
*NL*
Washington
.
They
who
had
most
admiringly
begged
Percy
Bresnahan
for
his
*NL*
opinions
were
least
interested
in
her
facts
.
She
laughed
at
herself
when
*NL*
she
saw
that
she
had
expected
to
be
at
once
a
heretic
and
a
returned
*NL*
hero
;
she
was
very
reasonable
and
merry
about
it
;
and
it
hurt
just
as
*NL*
much
as
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
baby
,
born
in
August
,
was
a
girl
.
Carol
could
not
decide
whether
she
*NL*
was
to
become
a
feminist
leader
or
marry
a
scientist
or
both
,
but
did
*NL*
settle
on
Vassar
and
a
tricolette
suit
with
a
small
black
hat
for
her
*NL*
Freshman
year
.
*NL*
*NL*

*NL*
Hugh
was
loquacious
at
breakfast

He
desired
to
give
his
impressions

owls

F
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

make
so
much
noise

growled
Kennicott

Carol
flared

``

it

VII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
The
Kennicotts
and
the
Sam
Clarks
had
driven
north
to
a
duck-pass
*NL*
between
two
lakes
,
on
an
autumn
day
of
blue
and
copper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
had
given
her
a
light
twenty-gauge
shotgun
.
She
had
a
first
*NL*
lesson
in
shooting
,
in
keeping
her
eyes
open
,
not
wincing
,
understanding
*NL*
that
the
bead
at
the
end
of
the
barrel
really
had
something
to
do
with
*NL*
pointing
the
gun
.
She
was
radiant
;
she
almost
believed
Sam
when
he
*NL*
insisted
that
it
was
she
who
had
shot
the
mallard
at
which
they
had
*NL*
fired
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
on
the
bank
of
the
reedy
lake
and
found
rest
in
Mrs.
Clark
's
*NL*
drawling
comments
on
nothing
.
The
brown
dusk
was
still
.
Behind
them
were
*NL*
dark
marshes
.
The
plowed
acres
smelled
fresh
.
The
lake
was
garnet
and
*NL*
silver
.
The
voices
of
the
men
,
waiting
for
the
last
flight
,
were
clear
*NL*
in
the
cool
air
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mark
left
!
''
sang
Kennicott
,
in
a
long-drawn
call
.
*NL*
*NL*
Three
ducks
were
swooping
down
in
a
swift
line
.
The
guns
banged
,
and
*NL*
a
duck
fluttered
.
The
men
pushed
their
light
boat
out
on
the
burnished
*NL*
lake
,
disappeared
beyond
the
reeds
.
Their
cheerful
voices
and
the
slow
*NL*
splash
and
clank
of
oars
came
back
to
Carol
from
the
dimness
.
In
the
sky
*NL*
a
fiery
plain
sloped
down
to
a
serene
harbor
.
It
dissolved
;
the
lake
*NL*
was
white
marble
;
and
Kennicott
was
crying
,
``
Well
,
old
lady
,
how
about
*NL*
hiking
out
for
home
?
Supper
taste
pretty
good
,
eh
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
sit
back
with
Ethel
,
''
she
said
,
at
the
car
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
the
first
time
she
had
called
Mrs.
Clark
by
her
given
name
;
the
*NL*
first
time
she
had
willingly
sat
back
,
a
woman
of
Main
Street
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'm
hungry
.
It
's
good
to
be
hungry
,
''
she
reflected
,
as
they
drove
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
looked
across
the
silent
fields
to
the
west
.
She
was
conscious
of
an
*NL*
unbroken
sweep
of
land
to
the
Rockies
,
to
Alaska
,
a
dominion
which
*NL*
will
rise
to
unexampled
greatness
when
other
empires
have
grown
senile
.
*NL*
Before
that
time
,
she
knew
,
a
hundred
generations
of
Carols
will
aspire
*NL*
and
go
down
in
tragedy
devoid
of
palls
and
solemn
chanting
,
the
humdrum
*NL*
inevitable
tragedy
of
struggle
against
inertia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Let
's
all
go
to
the
movies
tomorrow
night
.
Awfully
exciting
film
,
''
said
*NL*
Ethel
Clark
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
I
was
going
to
read
a
new
book
but
--
All
right
,
let
's
go
,
''
said
*NL*
Carol
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
're
too
much
for
me
,
''
Carol
sighed
to
Kennicott
.
``
I
've
been
*NL*
thinking
about
getting
up
an
annual
Community
Day
,
when
the
whole
town
*NL*
would
forget
feuds
and
go
out
and
have
sports
and
a
picnic
and
a
dance
.
*NL*
But
Bert
Tybee
-LRB-
why
did
you
ever
elect
him
mayor
?
-RRB-
--
he
's
kidnapped
my
*NL*
idea
.
He
wants
the
Community
Day
,
but
he
wants
to
have
some
politician
*NL*
`
give
an
address
.
'
That
's
just
the
stilted
sort
of
thing
I
've
tried
to
*NL*
avoid
.
He
asked
Vida
,
and
of
course
she
agreed
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Kennicott
considered
the
matter
while
he
wound
the
clock
and
they
*NL*
tramped
up-stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
would
jar
you
to
have
Bert
butting
in
,
''
he
said
amiably
.
``
Are
*NL*
you
going
to
do
much
fussing
over
this
Community
stunt
?
Do
n't
you
ever
*NL*
get
tired
of
fretting
and
stewing
and
experimenting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
n't
even
started
.
Look
!
''
She
led
him
to
the
nursery
door
,
pointed
*NL*
at
the
fuzzy
brown
head
of
her
daughter
.
``
Do
you
see
that
object
on
the
*NL*
pillow
?
Do
you
know
what
it
is
?
It
's
a
bomb
to
blow
up
smugness
.
If
you
*NL*
Tories
were
wise
,
you
would
n't
arrest
anarchists
;
you
'd
arrest
all
these
*NL*
children
while
they
're
asleep
in
their
cribs
.
Think
what
that
baby
will
*NL*
see
and
meddle
with
before
she
dies
in
the
year
2000
!
She
may
see
an
*NL*
industrial
union
of
the
whole
world
,
she
may
see
aeroplanes
going
to
*NL*
Mars
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yump
,
probably
be
changes
all
right
,
''
yawned
Kennicott
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
bed
while
he
hunted
through
his
bureau
for
a
*NL*
collar
which
ought
to
be
there
and
persistently
was
n't
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
'll
go
on
,
always
.
And
I
am
happy
.
But
this
Community
Day
makes
me
see
*NL*
how
thoroughly
I
'm
beaten
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
darn
collar
certainly
is
gone
for
keeps
,
''
muttered
Kennicott
and
,
*NL*
louder
,
``
Yes
,
I
guess
you
--
I
did
n't
quite
catch
what
you
said
,
dear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
patted
his
pillows
,
turned
down
his
sheets
,
as
she
reflected
:
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
have
won
in
this
:
I
've
never
excused
my
failures
by
sneering
at
*NL*
my
aspirations
,
by
pretending
to
have
gone
beyond
them
.
I
do
not
admit
*NL*
that
Main
Street
is
as
beautiful
as
it
should
be
!
I
do
not
admit
that
*NL*
Gopher
Prairie
is
greater
or
more
generous
than
Europe
!
I
do
not
admit
*NL*
that
dish-washing
is
enough
to
satisfy
all
women
!
I
may
not
have
fought
*NL*
the
good
fight
,
but
I
have
kept
the
faith
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sure
.
You
bet
you
have
,
''
said
Kennicott
.
``
Well
,
good
night
.
Sort
of
*NL*
feels
to
me
like
it
might
snow
tomorrow
.
Have
to
be
thinking
about
*NL*
putting
up
the
storm-windows
pretty
soon
.
Say
,
did
you
notice
whether
*NL*
the
girl
put
that
screwdriver
back
