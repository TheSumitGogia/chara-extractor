CHAPTER
I
*NL*
*NL*
About
thirty
years
ago
Miss
Maria
Ward
,
of
Huntingdon
,
with
only
seven
*NL*
thousand
pounds
,
had
the
good
luck
to
captivate
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
,
of
*NL*
Mansfield
Park
,
in
the
county
of
Northampton
,
and
to
be
thereby
raised
*NL*
to
the
rank
of
a
baronet
's
lady
,
with
all
the
comforts
and
consequences
*NL*
of
an
handsome
house
and
large
income
.
All
Huntingdon
exclaimed
on
the
*NL*
greatness
of
the
match
,
and
her
uncle
,
the
lawyer
,
himself
,
allowed
her
*NL*
to
be
at
least
three
thousand
pounds
short
of
any
equitable
claim
to
it
.
*NL*
She
had
two
sisters
to
be
benefited
by
her
elevation
;
and
such
of
their
*NL*
acquaintance
as
thought
Miss
Ward
and
Miss
Frances
quite
as
handsome
as
*NL*
Miss
Maria
,
did
not
scruple
to
predict
their
marrying
with
almost
equal
*NL*
advantage
.
But
there
certainly
are
not
so
many
men
of
large
fortune
in
*NL*
the
world
as
there
are
pretty
women
to
deserve
them
.
Miss
Ward
,
at
the
*NL*
end
of
half
a
dozen
years
,
found
herself
obliged
to
be
attached
to
*NL*
the
Rev.
Mr.
Norris
,
a
friend
of
her
brother-in-law
,
with
scarcely
any
*NL*
private
fortune
,
and
Miss
Frances
fared
yet
worse
.
Miss
Ward
's
match
,
*NL*
indeed
,
when
it
came
to
the
point
,
was
not
contemptible
:
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
being
happily
able
to
give
his
friend
an
income
in
the
living
of
*NL*
Mansfield
;
and
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Norris
began
their
career
of
conjugal
*NL*
felicity
with
very
little
less
than
a
thousand
a
year
.
But
Miss
Frances
*NL*
married
,
in
the
common
phrase
,
to
disoblige
her
family
,
and
by
fixing
on
*NL*
a
lieutenant
of
marines
,
without
education
,
fortune
,
or
connexions
,
did
*NL*
it
very
thoroughly
.
She
could
hardly
have
made
a
more
untoward
choice
.
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
had
interest
,
which
,
from
principle
as
well
as
*NL*
pride
--
from
a
general
wish
of
doing
right
,
and
a
desire
of
seeing
all
*NL*
that
were
connected
with
him
in
situations
of
respectability
,
he
would
*NL*
have
been
glad
to
exert
for
the
advantage
of
Lady
Bertram
's
sister
;
but
*NL*
her
husband
's
profession
was
such
as
no
interest
could
reach
;
and
before
*NL*
he
had
time
to
devise
any
other
method
of
assisting
them
,
an
absolute
*NL*
breach
between
the
sisters
had
taken
place
.
It
was
the
natural
result
of
*NL*
the
conduct
of
each
party
,
and
such
as
a
very
imprudent
marriage
almost
*NL*
always
produces
.
To
save
herself
from
useless
remonstrance
,
Mrs.
Price
*NL*
never
wrote
to
her
family
on
the
subject
till
actually
married
.
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
,
who
was
a
woman
of
very
tranquil
feelings
,
and
a
temper
*NL*
remarkably
easy
and
indolent
,
would
have
contented
herself
with
merely
*NL*
giving
up
her
sister
,
and
thinking
no
more
of
the
matter
;
but
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
had
a
spirit
of
activity
,
which
could
not
be
satisfied
till
she
*NL*
had
written
a
long
and
angry
letter
to
Fanny
,
to
point
out
the
folly
of
*NL*
her
conduct
,
and
threaten
her
with
all
its
possible
ill
consequences
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Price
,
in
her
turn
,
was
injured
and
angry
;
and
an
answer
,
which
*NL*
comprehended
each
sister
in
its
bitterness
,
and
bestowed
such
very
*NL*
disrespectful
reflections
on
the
pride
of
Sir
Thomas
as
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
could
not
possibly
keep
to
herself
,
put
an
end
to
all
intercourse
*NL*
between
them
for
a
considerable
period
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
homes
were
so
distant
,
and
the
circles
in
which
they
moved
so
*NL*
distinct
,
as
almost
to
preclude
the
means
of
ever
hearing
of
each
*NL*
other
's
existence
during
the
eleven
following
years
,
or
,
at
least
,
to
*NL*
make
it
very
wonderful
to
Sir
Thomas
that
Mrs.
Norris
should
ever
have
*NL*
it
in
her
power
to
tell
them
,
as
she
now
and
then
did
,
in
an
angry
*NL*
voice
,
that
Fanny
had
got
another
child
.
By
the
end
of
eleven
years
,
*NL*
however
,
Mrs.
Price
could
no
longer
afford
to
cherish
pride
or
*NL*
resentment
,
or
to
lose
one
connexion
that
might
possibly
assist
her
.
*NL*
A
large
and
still
increasing
family
,
an
husband
disabled
for
active
*NL*
service
,
but
not
the
less
equal
to
company
and
good
liquor
,
and
a
very
*NL*
small
income
to
supply
their
wants
,
made
her
eager
to
regain
the
friends
*NL*
she
had
so
carelessly
sacrificed
;
and
she
addressed
Lady
Bertram
in
*NL*
a
letter
which
spoke
so
much
contrition
and
despondence
,
such
a
*NL*
superfluity
of
children
,
and
such
a
want
of
almost
everything
else
,
as
*NL*
could
not
but
dispose
them
all
to
a
reconciliation
.
She
was
preparing
*NL*
for
her
ninth
lying-in
;
and
after
bewailing
the
circumstance
,
and
*NL*
imploring
their
countenance
as
sponsors
to
the
expected
child
,
she
*NL*
could
not
conceal
how
important
she
felt
they
might
be
to
the
future
*NL*
maintenance
of
the
eight
already
in
being
.
Her
eldest
was
a
boy
of
ten
*NL*
years
old
,
a
fine
spirited
fellow
,
who
longed
to
be
out
in
the
world
;
*NL*
but
what
could
she
do
?
Was
there
any
chance
of
his
being
hereafter
*NL*
useful
to
Sir
Thomas
in
the
concerns
of
his
West
Indian
property
?
*NL*
No
situation
would
be
beneath
him
;
or
what
did
Sir
Thomas
think
of
*NL*
Woolwich
?
or
how
could
a
boy
be
sent
out
to
the
East
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
letter
was
not
unproductive
.
It
re-established
peace
and
kindness
.
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
sent
friendly
advice
and
professions
,
Lady
Bertram
dispatched
*NL*
money
and
baby-linen
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
wrote
the
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
its
immediate
effects
,
and
within
a
twelvemonth
a
more
*NL*
important
advantage
to
Mrs.
Price
resulted
from
it
.
Mrs.
Norris
was
*NL*
often
observing
to
the
others
that
she
could
not
get
her
poor
sister
and
*NL*
her
family
out
of
her
head
,
and
that
,
much
as
they
had
all
done
for
her
,
*NL*
she
seemed
to
be
wanting
to
do
more
;
and
at
length
she
could
not
but
*NL*
own
it
to
be
her
wish
that
poor
Mrs.
Price
should
be
relieved
from
the
*NL*
charge
and
expense
of
one
child
entirely
out
of
her
great
number
.
``
What
*NL*
if
they
were
among
them
to
undertake
the
care
of
her
eldest
daughter
,
*NL*
a
girl
now
nine
years
old
,
of
an
age
to
require
more
attention
than
her
*NL*
poor
mother
could
possibly
give
?
The
trouble
and
expense
of
it
to
them
*NL*
would
be
nothing
,
compared
with
the
benevolence
of
the
action
.
''
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
agreed
with
her
instantly
.
``
I
think
we
can
not
do
better
,
''
said
*NL*
she
;
``
let
us
send
for
the
child
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
could
not
give
so
instantaneous
and
unqualified
a
consent
.
He
*NL*
debated
and
hesitated
;
--
it
was
a
serious
charge
;
--
a
girl
so
brought
up
*NL*
must
be
adequately
provided
for
,
or
there
would
be
cruelty
instead
*NL*
of
kindness
in
taking
her
from
her
family
.
He
thought
of
his
own
four
*NL*
children
,
of
his
two
sons
,
of
cousins
in
love
,
etc.
;
--
but
no
sooner
*NL*
had
he
deliberately
begun
to
state
his
objections
,
than
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
interrupted
him
with
a
reply
to
them
all
,
whether
stated
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
I
perfectly
comprehend
you
,
and
do
justice
to
the
*NL*
generosity
and
delicacy
of
your
notions
,
which
indeed
are
quite
of
a
*NL*
piece
with
your
general
conduct
;
and
I
entirely
agree
with
you
in
*NL*
the
main
as
to
the
propriety
of
doing
everything
one
could
by
way
of
*NL*
providing
for
a
child
one
had
in
a
manner
taken
into
one
's
own
hands
;
*NL*
and
I
am
sure
I
should
be
the
last
person
in
the
world
to
withhold
my
*NL*
mite
upon
such
an
occasion
.
Having
no
children
of
my
own
,
who
should
I
*NL*
look
to
in
any
little
matter
I
may
ever
have
to
bestow
,
but
the
children
*NL*
of
my
sisters
?
--
and
I
am
sure
Mr.
Norris
is
too
just
--
but
you
know
I
am
*NL*
a
woman
of
few
words
and
professions
.
Do
not
let
us
be
frightened
from
*NL*
a
good
deed
by
a
trifle
.
Give
a
girl
an
education
,
and
introduce
*NL*
her
properly
into
the
world
,
and
ten
to
one
but
she
has
the
means
of
*NL*
settling
well
,
without
farther
expense
to
anybody
.
A
niece
of
ours
,
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
,
I
may
say
,
or
at
least
of
_
yours
_
,
would
not
grow
up
in
this
*NL*
neighbourhood
without
many
advantages
.
I
do
n't
say
she
would
be
so
*NL*
handsome
as
her
cousins
.
I
dare
say
she
would
not
;
but
she
would
be
*NL*
introduced
into
the
society
of
this
country
under
such
very
favourable
*NL*
circumstances
as
,
in
all
human
probability
,
would
get
her
a
creditable
*NL*
establishment
.
You
are
thinking
of
your
sons
--
but
do
not
you
know
that
,
*NL*
of
all
things
upon
earth
,
_
that
_
is
the
least
likely
to
happen
,
brought
*NL*
up
as
they
would
be
,
always
together
like
brothers
and
sisters
?
It
is
*NL*
morally
impossible
.
I
never
knew
an
instance
of
it
.
It
is
,
in
fact
,
the
*NL*
only
sure
way
of
providing
against
the
connexion
.
Suppose
her
a
pretty
*NL*
girl
,
and
seen
by
Tom
or
Edmund
for
the
first
time
seven
years
hence
,
*NL*
and
I
dare
say
there
would
be
mischief
.
The
very
idea
of
her
having
been
*NL*
suffered
to
grow
up
at
a
distance
from
us
all
in
poverty
and
neglect
,
*NL*
would
be
enough
to
make
either
of
the
dear
,
sweet-tempered
boys
in
love
*NL*
with
her
.
But
breed
her
up
with
them
from
this
time
,
and
suppose
her
*NL*
even
to
have
the
beauty
of
an
angel
,
and
she
will
never
be
more
to
*NL*
either
than
a
sister
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
a
great
deal
of
truth
in
what
you
say
,
''
replied
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
``
and
far
be
it
from
me
to
throw
any
fanciful
impediment
in
the
way
of
a
*NL*
plan
which
would
be
so
consistent
with
the
relative
situations
of
each
.
*NL*
I
only
meant
to
observe
that
it
ought
not
to
be
lightly
engaged
in
,
*NL*
and
that
to
make
it
really
serviceable
to
Mrs.
Price
,
and
creditable
to
*NL*
ourselves
,
we
must
secure
to
the
child
,
or
consider
ourselves
engaged
to
*NL*
secure
to
her
hereafter
,
as
circumstances
may
arise
,
the
provision
of
*NL*
a
gentlewoman
,
if
no
such
establishment
should
offer
as
you
are
so
*NL*
sanguine
in
expecting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thoroughly
understand
you
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
you
are
everything
*NL*
that
is
generous
and
considerate
,
and
I
am
sure
we
shall
never
disagree
*NL*
on
this
point
.
Whatever
I
can
do
,
as
you
well
know
,
I
am
always
ready
*NL*
enough
to
do
for
the
good
of
those
I
love
;
and
,
though
I
could
never
*NL*
feel
for
this
little
girl
the
hundredth
part
of
the
regard
I
bear
your
*NL*
own
dear
children
,
nor
consider
her
,
in
any
respect
,
so
much
my
own
,
*NL*
I
should
hate
myself
if
I
were
capable
of
neglecting
her
.
Is
not
she
a
*NL*
sister
's
child
?
and
could
I
bear
to
see
her
want
while
I
had
a
bit
of
*NL*
bread
to
give
her
?
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
with
all
my
faults
I
have
a
warm
*NL*
heart
;
and
,
poor
as
I
am
,
would
rather
deny
myself
the
necessaries
of
*NL*
life
than
do
an
ungenerous
thing
.
So
,
if
you
are
not
against
it
,
I
will
*NL*
write
to
my
poor
sister
tomorrow
,
and
make
the
proposal
;
and
,
as
soon
*NL*
as
matters
are
settled
,
_
I
_
will
engage
to
get
the
child
to
Mansfield
;
*NL*
_
you
_
shall
have
no
trouble
about
it
.
My
own
trouble
,
you
know
,
I
never
*NL*
regard
.
I
will
send
Nanny
to
London
on
purpose
,
and
she
may
have
a
bed
*NL*
at
her
cousin
the
saddler
's
,
and
the
child
be
appointed
to
meet
her
*NL*
there
.
They
may
easily
get
her
from
Portsmouth
to
town
by
the
coach
,
*NL*
under
the
care
of
any
creditable
person
that
may
chance
to
be
going
.
I
*NL*
dare
say
there
is
always
some
reputable
tradesman
's
wife
or
other
going
*NL*
up
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Except
to
the
attack
on
Nanny
's
cousin
,
Sir
Thomas
no
longer
made
any
*NL*
objection
,
and
a
more
respectable
,
though
less
economical
rendezvous
*NL*
being
accordingly
substituted
,
everything
was
considered
as
settled
,
*NL*
and
the
pleasures
of
so
benevolent
a
scheme
were
already
enjoyed
.
The
*NL*
division
of
gratifying
sensations
ought
not
,
in
strict
justice
,
to
*NL*
have
been
equal
;
for
Sir
Thomas
was
fully
resolved
to
be
the
real
and
*NL*
consistent
patron
of
the
selected
child
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
had
not
the
*NL*
least
intention
of
being
at
any
expense
whatever
in
her
maintenance
.
*NL*
As
far
as
walking
,
talking
,
and
contriving
reached
,
she
was
thoroughly
*NL*
benevolent
,
and
nobody
knew
better
how
to
dictate
liberality
to
others
;
*NL*
but
her
love
of
money
was
equal
to
her
love
of
directing
,
and
she
knew
*NL*
quite
as
well
how
to
save
her
own
as
to
spend
that
of
her
friends
.
*NL*
Having
married
on
a
narrower
income
than
she
had
been
used
to
look
*NL*
forward
to
,
she
had
,
from
the
first
,
fancied
a
very
strict
line
of
*NL*
economy
necessary
;
and
what
was
begun
as
a
matter
of
prudence
,
soon
grew
*NL*
into
a
matter
of
choice
,
as
an
object
of
that
needful
solicitude
which
*NL*
there
were
no
children
to
supply
.
Had
there
been
a
family
to
provide
*NL*
for
,
Mrs.
Norris
might
never
have
saved
her
money
;
but
having
no
care
*NL*
of
that
kind
,
there
was
nothing
to
impede
her
frugality
,
or
lessen
the
*NL*
comfort
of
making
a
yearly
addition
to
an
income
which
they
had
never
*NL*
lived
up
to
.
Under
this
infatuating
principle
,
counteracted
by
no
real
*NL*
affection
for
her
sister
,
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
aim
at
more
than
*NL*
the
credit
of
projecting
and
arranging
so
expensive
a
charity
;
though
*NL*
perhaps
she
might
so
little
know
herself
as
to
walk
home
to
the
*NL*
Parsonage
,
after
this
conversation
,
in
the
happy
belief
of
being
the
*NL*
most
liberal-minded
sister
and
aunt
in
the
world
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
subject
was
brought
forward
again
,
her
views
were
more
fully
*NL*
explained
;
and
,
in
reply
to
Lady
Bertram
's
calm
inquiry
of
``
Where
shall
*NL*
the
child
come
to
first
,
sister
,
to
you
or
to
us
?
''
Sir
Thomas
heard
with
*NL*
some
surprise
that
it
would
be
totally
out
of
Mrs.
Norris
's
power
to
*NL*
take
any
share
in
the
personal
charge
of
her
.
He
had
been
considering
*NL*
her
as
a
particularly
welcome
addition
at
the
Parsonage
,
as
a
desirable
*NL*
companion
to
an
aunt
who
had
no
children
of
her
own
;
but
he
found
*NL*
himself
wholly
mistaken
.
Mrs.
Norris
was
sorry
to
say
that
the
little
*NL*
girl
's
staying
with
them
,
at
least
as
things
then
were
,
was
quite
out
of
*NL*
the
question
.
Poor
Mr.
Norris
's
indifferent
state
of
health
made
it
an
*NL*
impossibility
:
he
could
no
more
bear
the
noise
of
a
child
than
he
could
*NL*
fly
;
if
,
indeed
,
he
should
ever
get
well
of
his
gouty
complaints
,
it
*NL*
would
be
a
different
matter
:
she
should
then
be
glad
to
take
her
turn
,
*NL*
and
think
nothing
of
the
inconvenience
;
but
just
now
,
poor
Mr.
Norris
*NL*
took
up
every
moment
of
her
time
,
and
the
very
mention
of
such
a
thing
*NL*
she
was
sure
would
distract
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
she
had
better
come
to
us
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
,
with
the
utmost
*NL*
composure
.
After
a
short
pause
Sir
Thomas
added
with
dignity
,
``
Yes
,
let
*NL*
her
home
be
in
this
house
.
We
will
endeavour
to
do
our
duty
by
her
,
and
*NL*
she
will
,
at
least
,
have
the
advantage
of
companions
of
her
own
age
,
and
*NL*
of
a
regular
instructress
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
which
are
both
very
important
*NL*
considerations
;
and
it
will
be
just
the
same
to
Miss
Lee
whether
she
has
*NL*
three
girls
to
teach
,
or
only
two
--
there
can
be
no
difference
.
I
only
*NL*
wish
I
could
be
more
useful
;
but
you
see
I
do
all
in
my
power
.
I
am
not
*NL*
one
of
those
that
spare
their
own
trouble
;
and
Nanny
shall
fetch
her
,
*NL*
however
it
may
put
me
to
inconvenience
to
have
my
chief
counsellor
away
*NL*
for
three
days
.
I
suppose
,
sister
,
you
will
put
the
child
in
the
little
*NL*
white
attic
,
near
the
old
nurseries
.
It
will
be
much
the
best
place
*NL*
for
her
,
so
near
Miss
Lee
,
and
not
far
from
the
girls
,
and
close
by
the
*NL*
housemaids
,
who
could
either
of
them
help
to
dress
her
,
you
know
,
and
*NL*
take
care
of
her
clothes
,
for
I
suppose
you
would
not
think
it
fair
to
*NL*
expect
Ellis
to
wait
on
her
as
well
as
the
others
.
Indeed
,
I
do
not
see
*NL*
that
you
could
possibly
place
her
anywhere
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
made
no
opposition
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
will
prove
a
well-disposed
girl
,
''
continued
Mrs.
Norris
,
*NL*
``
and
be
sensible
of
her
uncommon
good
fortune
in
having
such
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Should
her
disposition
be
really
bad
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
``
we
must
not
,
*NL*
for
our
own
children
's
sake
,
continue
her
in
the
family
;
but
there
is
*NL*
no
reason
to
expect
so
great
an
evil
.
We
shall
probably
see
much
to
wish
*NL*
altered
in
her
,
and
must
prepare
ourselves
for
gross
ignorance
,
some
*NL*
meanness
of
opinions
,
and
very
distressing
vulgarity
of
manner
;
but
*NL*
these
are
not
incurable
faults
;
nor
,
I
trust
,
can
they
be
dangerous
for
*NL*
her
associates
.
Had
my
daughters
been
_
younger
_
than
herself
,
I
should
*NL*
have
considered
the
introduction
of
such
a
companion
as
a
matter
of
very
*NL*
serious
moment
;
but
,
as
it
is
,
I
hope
there
can
be
nothing
to
fear
for
*NL*
_
them
_
,
and
everything
to
hope
for
_
her
_
,
from
the
association
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
exactly
what
I
think
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
and
what
I
was
*NL*
saying
to
my
husband
this
morning
.
It
will
be
an
education
for
the
*NL*
child
,
said
I
,
only
being
with
her
cousins
;
if
Miss
Lee
taught
her
*NL*
nothing
,
she
would
learn
to
be
good
and
clever
from
_
them
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
she
will
not
tease
my
poor
pug
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
;
``
I
have
but
*NL*
just
got
Julia
to
leave
it
alone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
will
be
some
difficulty
in
our
way
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
''
observed
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
,
``
as
to
the
distinction
proper
to
be
made
between
the
girls
*NL*
as
they
grow
up
:
how
to
preserve
in
the
minds
of
my
_
daughters
_
the
*NL*
consciousness
of
what
they
are
,
without
making
them
think
too
lowly
of
*NL*
their
cousin
;
and
how
,
without
depressing
her
spirits
too
far
,
to
make
*NL*
her
remember
that
she
is
not
a
_
Miss
Bertram
_
.
I
should
wish
to
see
them
*NL*
very
good
friends
,
and
would
,
on
no
account
,
authorise
in
my
girls
the
*NL*
smallest
degree
of
arrogance
towards
their
relation
;
but
still
they
*NL*
can
not
be
equals
.
Their
rank
,
fortune
,
rights
,
and
expectations
will
*NL*
always
be
different
.
It
is
a
point
of
great
delicacy
,
and
you
must
*NL*
assist
us
in
our
endeavours
to
choose
exactly
the
right
line
of
*NL*
conduct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
was
quite
at
his
service
;
and
though
she
perfectly
agreed
*NL*
with
him
as
to
its
being
a
most
difficult
thing
,
encouraged
him
to
hope
*NL*
that
between
them
it
would
be
easily
managed
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
will
be
readily
believed
that
Mrs.
Norris
did
not
write
to
her
sister
*NL*
in
vain
.
Mrs.
Price
seemed
rather
surprised
that
a
girl
should
be
*NL*
fixed
on
,
when
she
had
so
many
fine
boys
,
but
accepted
the
offer
most
*NL*
thankfully
,
assuring
them
of
her
daughter
's
being
a
very
well-disposed
,
*NL*
good-humoured
girl
,
and
trusting
they
would
never
have
cause
to
throw
*NL*
her
off
.
She
spoke
of
her
farther
as
somewhat
delicate
and
puny
,
but
was
*NL*
sanguine
in
the
hope
of
her
being
materially
better
for
change
of
air
.
*NL*
Poor
woman
!
she
probably
thought
change
of
air
might
agree
with
many
of
*NL*
her
children
.

CHAPTER
II
*NL*
*NL*
The
little
girl
performed
her
long
journey
in
safety
;
and
at
Northampton
*NL*
was
met
by
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
thus
regaled
in
the
credit
of
being
foremost
*NL*
to
welcome
her
,
and
in
the
importance
of
leading
her
in
to
the
others
,
*NL*
and
recommending
her
to
their
kindness
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
Price
was
at
this
time
just
ten
years
old
,
and
though
there
might
*NL*
not
be
much
in
her
first
appearance
to
captivate
,
there
was
,
at
least
,
*NL*
nothing
to
disgust
her
relations
.
She
was
small
of
her
age
,
with
no
glow
*NL*
of
complexion
,
nor
any
other
striking
beauty
;
exceedingly
timid
and
shy
,
*NL*
and
shrinking
from
notice
;
but
her
air
,
though
awkward
,
was
not
vulgar
,
*NL*
her
voice
was
sweet
,
and
when
she
spoke
her
countenance
was
pretty
.
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
and
Lady
Bertram
received
her
very
kindly
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
seeing
how
much
she
needed
encouragement
,
tried
to
be
all
that
was
*NL*
conciliating
:
but
he
had
to
work
against
a
most
untoward
gravity
of
*NL*
deportment
;
and
Lady
Bertram
,
without
taking
half
so
much
trouble
,
or
*NL*
speaking
one
word
where
he
spoke
ten
,
by
the
mere
aid
of
a
good-humoured
*NL*
smile
,
became
immediately
the
less
awful
character
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
people
were
all
at
home
,
and
sustained
their
share
in
the
*NL*
introduction
very
well
,
with
much
good
humour
,
and
no
embarrassment
,
at
*NL*
least
on
the
part
of
the
sons
,
who
,
at
seventeen
and
sixteen
,
and
tall
*NL*
of
their
age
,
had
all
the
grandeur
of
men
in
the
eyes
of
their
little
*NL*
cousin
.
The
two
girls
were
more
at
a
loss
from
being
younger
and
in
*NL*
greater
awe
of
their
father
,
who
addressed
them
on
the
occasion
with
*NL*
rather
an
injudicious
particularity
.
But
they
were
too
much
used
to
*NL*
company
and
praise
to
have
anything
like
natural
shyness
;
and
their
*NL*
confidence
increasing
from
their
cousin
's
total
want
of
it
,
they
were
*NL*
soon
able
to
take
a
full
survey
of
her
face
and
her
frock
in
easy
*NL*
indifference
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
a
remarkably
fine
family
,
the
sons
very
well-looking
,
the
*NL*
daughters
decidedly
handsome
,
and
all
of
them
well-grown
and
forward
of
*NL*
their
age
,
which
produced
as
striking
a
difference
between
the
cousins
*NL*
in
person
,
as
education
had
given
to
their
address
;
and
no
one
would
*NL*
have
supposed
the
girls
so
nearly
of
an
age
as
they
really
were
.
There
*NL*
were
in
fact
but
two
years
between
the
youngest
and
Fanny
.
Julia
*NL*
Bertram
was
only
twelve
,
and
Maria
but
a
year
older
.
The
little
visitor
*NL*
meanwhile
was
as
unhappy
as
possible
.
Afraid
of
everybody
,
ashamed
of
*NL*
herself
,
and
longing
for
the
home
she
had
left
,
she
knew
not
how
to
look
*NL*
up
,
and
could
scarcely
speak
to
be
heard
,
or
without
crying
.
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
had
been
talking
to
her
the
whole
way
from
Northampton
of
her
wonderful
*NL*
good
fortune
,
and
the
extraordinary
degree
of
gratitude
and
good
*NL*
behaviour
which
it
ought
to
produce
,
and
her
consciousness
of
misery
was
*NL*
therefore
increased
by
the
idea
of
its
being
a
wicked
thing
for
her
*NL*
not
to
be
happy
.
The
fatigue
,
too
,
of
so
long
a
journey
,
became
soon
no
*NL*
trifling
evil
.
In
vain
were
the
well-meant
condescensions
of
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
and
all
the
officious
prognostications
of
Mrs.
Norris
that
she
would
be
*NL*
a
good
girl
;
in
vain
did
Lady
Bertram
smile
and
make
her
sit
on
the
sofa
*NL*
with
herself
and
pug
,
and
vain
was
even
the
sight
of
a
gooseberry
tart
*NL*
towards
giving
her
comfort
;
she
could
scarcely
swallow
two
mouthfuls
*NL*
before
tears
interrupted
her
,
and
sleep
seeming
to
be
her
likeliest
*NL*
friend
,
she
was
taken
to
finish
her
sorrows
in
bed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
a
very
promising
beginning
,
''
said
Mrs.
Norris
,
when
Fanny
*NL*
had
left
the
room
.
``
After
all
that
I
said
to
her
as
we
came
along
,
I
*NL*
thought
she
would
have
behaved
better
;
I
told
her
how
much
might
depend
*NL*
upon
her
acquitting
herself
well
at
first
.
I
wish
there
may
not
be
a
*NL*
little
sulkiness
of
temper
--
her
poor
mother
had
a
good
deal
;
but
we
must
*NL*
make
allowances
for
such
a
child
--
and
I
do
not
know
that
her
being
sorry
*NL*
to
leave
her
home
is
really
against
her
,
for
,
with
all
its
faults
,
*NL*
it
_
was
_
her
home
,
and
she
can
not
as
yet
understand
how
much
she
has
*NL*
changed
for
the
better
;
but
then
there
is
moderation
in
all
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
required
a
longer
time
,
however
,
than
Mrs.
Norris
was
inclined
to
*NL*
allow
,
to
reconcile
Fanny
to
the
novelty
of
Mansfield
Park
,
and
the
*NL*
separation
from
everybody
she
had
been
used
to
.
Her
feelings
were
very
*NL*
acute
,
and
too
little
understood
to
be
properly
attended
to
.
Nobody
*NL*
meant
to
be
unkind
,
but
nobody
put
themselves
out
of
their
way
to
secure
*NL*
her
comfort
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
holiday
allowed
to
the
Miss
Bertrams
the
next
day
,
on
purpose
to
*NL*
afford
leisure
for
getting
acquainted
with
,
and
entertaining
their
young
*NL*
cousin
,
produced
little
union
.
They
could
not
but
hold
her
cheap
on
*NL*
finding
that
she
had
but
two
sashes
,
and
had
never
learned
French
;
and
*NL*
when
they
perceived
her
to
be
little
struck
with
the
duet
they
were
so
*NL*
good
as
to
play
,
they
could
do
no
more
than
make
her
a
generous
present
*NL*
of
some
of
their
least
valued
toys
,
and
leave
her
to
herself
,
while
*NL*
they
adjourned
to
whatever
might
be
the
favourite
holiday
sport
of
the
*NL*
moment
,
making
artificial
flowers
or
wasting
gold
paper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
whether
near
or
from
her
cousins
,
whether
in
the
schoolroom
,
the
*NL*
drawing-room
,
or
the
shrubbery
,
was
equally
forlorn
,
finding
something
*NL*
to
fear
in
every
person
and
place
.
She
was
disheartened
by
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
's
silence
,
awed
by
Sir
Thomas
's
grave
looks
,
and
quite
overcome
*NL*
by
Mrs.
Norris
's
admonitions
.
Her
elder
cousins
mortified
her
by
*NL*
reflections
on
her
size
,
and
abashed
her
by
noticing
her
shyness
:
Miss
*NL*
Lee
wondered
at
her
ignorance
,
and
the
maid-servants
sneered
at
her
*NL*
clothes
;
and
when
to
these
sorrows
was
added
the
idea
of
the
brothers
*NL*
and
sisters
among
whom
she
had
always
been
important
as
playfellow
,
*NL*
instructress
,
and
nurse
,
the
despondence
that
sunk
her
little
heart
was
*NL*
severe
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
grandeur
of
the
house
astonished
,
but
could
not
console
her
.
The
*NL*
rooms
were
too
large
for
her
to
move
in
with
ease
:
whatever
she
touched
*NL*
she
expected
to
injure
,
and
she
crept
about
in
constant
terror
of
*NL*
something
or
other
;
often
retreating
towards
her
own
chamber
to
cry
;
and
*NL*
the
little
girl
who
was
spoken
of
in
the
drawing-room
when
she
left
it
*NL*
at
night
as
seeming
so
desirably
sensible
of
her
peculiar
good
fortune
,
*NL*
ended
every
day
's
sorrows
by
sobbing
herself
to
sleep
.
A
week
had
*NL*
passed
in
this
way
,
and
no
suspicion
of
it
conveyed
by
her
quiet
*NL*
passive
manner
,
when
she
was
found
one
morning
by
her
cousin
Edmund
,
the
*NL*
youngest
of
the
sons
,
sitting
crying
on
the
attic
stairs
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
little
cousin
,
''
said
he
,
with
all
the
gentleness
of
an
*NL*
excellent
nature
,
``
what
can
be
the
matter
?
''
And
sitting
down
by
her
,
*NL*
he
was
at
great
pains
to
overcome
her
shame
in
being
so
surprised
,
and
*NL*
persuade
her
to
speak
openly
.
Was
she
ill
?
or
was
anybody
angry
with
*NL*
her
?
or
had
she
quarrelled
with
Maria
and
Julia
?
or
was
she
puzzled
*NL*
about
anything
in
her
lesson
that
he
could
explain
?
Did
she
,
in
short
,
*NL*
want
anything
he
could
possibly
get
her
,
or
do
for
her
?
For
a
long
while
*NL*
no
answer
could
be
obtained
beyond
a
``
no
,
no
--
not
at
all
--
no
,
thank
*NL*
you
''
;
but
he
still
persevered
;
and
no
sooner
had
he
begun
to
revert
*NL*
to
her
own
home
,
than
her
increased
sobs
explained
to
him
where
the
*NL*
grievance
lay
.
He
tried
to
console
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
sorry
to
leave
Mama
,
my
dear
little
Fanny
,
''
said
he
,
``
which
*NL*
shows
you
to
be
a
very
good
girl
;
but
you
must
remember
that
you
are
*NL*
with
relations
and
friends
,
who
all
love
you
,
and
wish
to
make
you
*NL*
happy
.
Let
us
walk
out
in
the
park
,
and
you
shall
tell
me
all
about
your
*NL*
brothers
and
sisters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
On
pursuing
the
subject
,
he
found
that
,
dear
as
all
these
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
generally
were
,
there
was
one
among
them
who
ran
more
in
her
*NL*
thoughts
than
the
rest
.
It
was
William
whom
she
talked
of
most
,
and
*NL*
wanted
most
to
see
.
William
,
the
eldest
,
a
year
older
than
herself
,
her
*NL*
constant
companion
and
friend
;
her
advocate
with
her
mother
-LRB-
of
whom
*NL*
he
was
the
darling
-RRB-
in
every
distress
.
``
William
did
not
like
she
should
*NL*
come
away
;
he
had
told
her
he
should
miss
her
very
much
indeed
.
''
``
But
*NL*
William
will
write
to
you
,
I
dare
say
.
''
``
Yes
,
he
had
promised
he
would
,
*NL*
but
he
had
told
_
her
_
to
write
first
.
''
``
And
when
shall
you
do
it
?
''
She
*NL*
hung
her
head
and
answered
hesitatingly
,
``
she
did
not
know
;
she
had
not
*NL*
any
paper
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
be
all
your
difficulty
,
I
will
furnish
you
with
paper
and
every
*NL*
other
material
,
and
you
may
write
your
letter
whenever
you
choose
.
Would
*NL*
it
make
you
happy
to
write
to
William
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
let
it
be
done
now
.
Come
with
me
into
the
breakfast-room
,
we
shall
*NL*
find
everything
there
,
and
be
sure
of
having
the
room
to
ourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
cousin
,
will
it
go
to
the
post
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
depend
upon
me
it
shall
:
it
shall
go
with
the
other
letters
;
and
,
*NL*
as
your
uncle
will
frank
it
,
it
will
cost
William
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
uncle
!
''
repeated
Fanny
,
with
a
frightened
look
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
when
you
have
written
the
letter
,
I
will
take
it
to
my
father
to
*NL*
frank
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
thought
it
a
bold
measure
,
but
offered
no
further
resistance
;
and
*NL*
they
went
together
into
the
breakfast-room
,
where
Edmund
prepared
her
*NL*
paper
,
and
ruled
her
lines
with
all
the
goodwill
that
her
brother
*NL*
could
himself
have
felt
,
and
probably
with
somewhat
more
exactness
.
He
*NL*
continued
with
her
the
whole
time
of
her
writing
,
to
assist
her
with
his
*NL*
penknife
or
his
orthography
,
as
either
were
wanted
;
and
added
to
these
*NL*
attentions
,
which
she
felt
very
much
,
a
kindness
to
her
brother
which
*NL*
delighted
her
beyond
all
the
rest
.
He
wrote
with
his
own
hand
his
*NL*
love
to
his
cousin
William
,
and
sent
him
half
a
guinea
under
the
seal
.
*NL*
Fanny
's
feelings
on
the
occasion
were
such
as
she
believed
herself
*NL*
incapable
of
expressing
;
but
her
countenance
and
a
few
artless
words
*NL*
fully
conveyed
all
their
gratitude
and
delight
,
and
her
cousin
began
*NL*
to
find
her
an
interesting
object
.
He
talked
to
her
more
,
and
,
from
all
*NL*
that
she
said
,
was
convinced
of
her
having
an
affectionate
heart
,
and
*NL*
a
strong
desire
of
doing
right
;
and
he
could
perceive
her
to
be
farther
*NL*
entitled
to
attention
by
great
sensibility
of
her
situation
,
and
great
*NL*
timidity
.
He
had
never
knowingly
given
her
pain
,
but
he
now
felt
that
*NL*
she
required
more
positive
kindness
;
and
with
that
view
endeavoured
,
*NL*
in
the
first
place
,
to
lessen
her
fears
of
them
all
,
and
gave
her
*NL*
especially
a
great
deal
of
good
advice
as
to
playing
with
Maria
and
*NL*
Julia
,
and
being
as
merry
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
day
Fanny
grew
more
comfortable
.
She
felt
that
she
had
a
*NL*
friend
,
and
the
kindness
of
her
cousin
Edmund
gave
her
better
spirits
*NL*
with
everybody
else
.
The
place
became
less
strange
,
and
the
people
less
*NL*
formidable
;
and
if
there
were
some
amongst
them
whom
she
could
not
cease
*NL*
to
fear
,
she
began
at
least
to
know
their
ways
,
and
to
catch
the
best
*NL*
manner
of
conforming
to
them
.
The
little
rusticities
and
awkwardnesses
*NL*
which
had
at
first
made
grievous
inroads
on
the
tranquillity
of
all
,
*NL*
and
not
least
of
herself
,
necessarily
wore
away
,
and
she
was
no
longer
*NL*
materially
afraid
to
appear
before
her
uncle
,
nor
did
her
aunt
Norris
's
*NL*
voice
make
her
start
very
much
.
To
her
cousins
she
became
occasionally
*NL*
an
acceptable
companion
.
Though
unworthy
,
from
inferiority
of
age
and
*NL*
strength
,
to
be
their
constant
associate
,
their
pleasures
and
schemes
*NL*
were
sometimes
of
a
nature
to
make
a
third
very
useful
,
especially
when
*NL*
that
third
was
of
an
obliging
,
yielding
temper
;
and
they
could
not
but
*NL*
own
,
when
their
aunt
inquired
into
her
faults
,
or
their
brother
Edmund
*NL*
urged
her
claims
to
their
kindness
,
that
``
Fanny
was
good-natured
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
uniformly
kind
himself
;
and
she
had
nothing
worse
to
endure
*NL*
on
the
part
of
Tom
than
that
sort
of
merriment
which
a
young
man
of
*NL*
seventeen
will
always
think
fair
with
a
child
of
ten
.
He
was
just
*NL*
entering
into
life
,
full
of
spirits
,
and
with
all
the
liberal
*NL*
dispositions
of
an
eldest
son
,
who
feels
born
only
for
expense
and
*NL*
enjoyment
.
His
kindness
to
his
little
cousin
was
consistent
with
his
*NL*
situation
and
rights
:
he
made
her
some
very
pretty
presents
,
and
laughed
*NL*
at
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
her
appearance
and
spirits
improved
,
Sir
Thomas
and
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
thought
with
greater
satisfaction
of
their
benevolent
plan
;
and
it
*NL*
was
pretty
soon
decided
between
them
that
,
though
far
from
clever
,
she
*NL*
showed
a
tractable
disposition
,
and
seemed
likely
to
give
them
little
*NL*
trouble
.
A
mean
opinion
of
her
abilities
was
not
confined
to
_
them
_
.
*NL*
Fanny
could
read
,
work
,
and
write
,
but
she
had
been
taught
nothing
more
;
*NL*
and
as
her
cousins
found
her
ignorant
of
many
things
with
which
they
had
*NL*
been
long
familiar
,
they
thought
her
prodigiously
stupid
,
and
for
the
*NL*
first
two
or
three
weeks
were
continually
bringing
some
fresh
report
of
*NL*
it
into
the
drawing-room
.
``
Dear
mama
,
only
think
,
my
cousin
can
not
*NL*
put
the
map
of
Europe
together
--
or
my
cousin
can
not
tell
the
principal
*NL*
rivers
in
Russia
--
or
,
she
never
heard
of
Asia
Minor
--
or
she
does
*NL*
not
know
the
difference
between
water-colours
and
crayons
!
--
How
*NL*
strange
!
--
Did
you
ever
hear
anything
so
stupid
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
their
considerate
aunt
would
reply
,
``
it
is
very
bad
,
but
*NL*
you
must
not
expect
everybody
to
be
as
forward
and
quick
at
learning
as
*NL*
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
aunt
,
she
is
really
so
very
ignorant
!
--
Do
you
know
,
we
asked
her
*NL*
last
night
which
way
she
would
go
to
get
to
Ireland
;
and
she
said
,
she
*NL*
should
cross
to
the
Isle
of
Wight
.
She
thinks
of
nothing
but
the
Isle
of
*NL*
Wight
,
and
she
calls
it
_
the
_
_
Island
_
,
as
if
there
were
no
other
island
*NL*
in
the
world
.
I
am
sure
I
should
have
been
ashamed
of
myself
,
if
I
had
*NL*
not
known
better
long
before
I
was
so
old
as
she
is
.
I
can
not
remember
*NL*
the
time
when
I
did
not
know
a
great
deal
that
she
has
not
the
least
*NL*
notion
of
yet
.
How
long
ago
it
is
,
aunt
,
since
we
used
to
repeat
the
*NL*
chronological
order
of
the
kings
of
England
,
with
the
dates
of
their
*NL*
accession
,
and
most
of
the
principal
events
of
their
reigns
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
added
the
other
;
``
and
of
the
Roman
emperors
as
low
as
Severus
;
*NL*
besides
a
great
deal
of
the
heathen
mythology
,
and
all
the
metals
,
*NL*
semi-metals
,
planets
,
and
distinguished
philosophers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
indeed
,
my
dears
,
but
you
are
blessed
with
wonderful
*NL*
memories
,
and
your
poor
cousin
has
probably
none
at
all
.
There
is
a
*NL*
vast
deal
of
difference
in
memories
,
as
well
as
in
everything
else
,
*NL*
and
therefore
you
must
make
allowance
for
your
cousin
,
and
pity
her
*NL*
deficiency
.
And
remember
that
,
if
you
are
ever
so
forward
and
clever
*NL*
yourselves
,
you
should
always
be
modest
;
for

much
as
you
know
already

there
is
a
great
deal
more
for
you
to
learn

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
know
there
is
,
till
I
am
seventeen

But
I
must
tell
you
another
*NL*
thing
of
Fanny
,
so
odd
and
so
stupid
.
Do
you
know
,
she
says
she
does
not
*NL*
want
to
learn
either
music
or
drawing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
my
dear
,
that
is
very
stupid
indeed
,
and
shows
a
great
*NL*
want
of
genius
and
emulation
.
But
,
all
things
considered
,
I
do
not
know
*NL*
whether
it
is
not
as
well
that
it
should
be
so

for
,
though
you
know
*NL*
-LRB-
owing
to
me
-RRB-
your
papa
and
mama
are
so
good
as
to
bring
her
up
with
*NL*
you
,
it
is
not
at
all
necessary
that
she
should
be
as
accomplished
as
*NL*
you
are
;
--
on
the
contrary
,
it
is
much
more
desirable
that
there
should
*NL*
be
a
difference
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
were
the
counsels
by
which
Mrs.
Norris
assisted
to
form
her
nieces
'
*NL*
minds
;
and
it
is
not
very
wonderful
that
,
with
all
their
promising
*NL*
talents
and
early
information
,
they
should
be
entirely
deficient
in
the
*NL*
less
common
acquirements
of
self-knowledge
,
generosity
and
humility
.
In
*NL*
everything
but
disposition
they
were
admirably
taught
.
Sir
Thomas
did
*NL*
not
know
what
was
wanting
,
because
,
though
a
truly
anxious
father
,
he
*NL*
was
not
outwardly
affectionate
,
and
the
reserve
of
his
manner
repressed
*NL*
all
the
flow
of
their
spirits
before
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
education
of
her
daughters
Lady
Bertram
paid
not
the
smallest
*NL*
attention
.
She
had
not
time
for
such
cares
.
She
was
a
woman
who
spent
*NL*
her
days
in
sitting
,
nicely
dressed
,
on
a
sofa
,
doing
some
long
piece
of
*NL*
needlework
,
of
little
use
and
no
beauty
,
thinking
more
of
her
pug
than
*NL*
her
children
,
but
very
indulgent
to
the
latter
when
it
did
not
put
*NL*
herself
to
inconvenience
,
guided
in
everything
important
by
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
and
in
smaller
concerns
by
her
sister
.
Had
she
possessed
greater
leisure
*NL*
for
the
service
of
her
girls
,
she
would
probably
have
supposed
it
*NL*
unnecessary
,
for
they
were
under
the
care
of
a
governess
,
with
proper
*NL*
masters
,
and
could
want
nothing
more
.
As
for
Fanny
's
being
stupid
at
*NL*
learning
,
``
she
could
only
say
it
was
very
unlucky
,
but
some
people
*NL*
_
were
_
stupid
,
and
Fanny
must
take
more
pains
:
she
did
not
know
what
*NL*
else
was
to
be
done
;
and
,
except
her
being
so
dull
,
she
must
add
she
saw
*NL*
no
harm
in
the
poor
little
thing
,
and
always
found
her
very
handy
and
*NL*
quick
in
carrying
messages
,
and
fetching
what
she
wanted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
with
all
her
faults
of
ignorance
and
timidity
,
was
fixed
at
*NL*
Mansfield
Park
,
and
learning
to
transfer
in
its
favour
much
of
her
*NL*
attachment
to
her
former
home
,
grew
up
there
not
unhappily
among
her
*NL*
cousins
.
There
was
no
positive
ill-nature
in
Maria
or
Julia
;
and
though
*NL*
Fanny
was
often
mortified
by
their
treatment
of
her
,
she
thought
too
*NL*
lowly
of
her
own
claims
to
feel
injured
by
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
From
about
the
time
of
her
entering
the
family
,
Lady
Bertram
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
a
little
ill-health
,
and
a
great
deal
of
indolence
,
gave
*NL*
up
the
house
in
town
,
which
she
had
been
used
to
occupy
every
spring
,
*NL*
and
remained
wholly
in
the
country
,
leaving
Sir
Thomas
to
attend
his
*NL*
duty
in
Parliament
,
with
whatever
increase
or
diminution
of
comfort
*NL*
might
arise
from
her
absence
.
In
the
country
,
therefore
,
the
Miss
*NL*
Bertrams
continued
to
exercise
their
memories
,
practise
their
duets
,
*NL*
and
grow
tall
and
womanly
:
and
their
father
saw
them
becoming
in
person
,
*NL*
manner
,
and
accomplishments
,
everything
that
could
satisfy
his
anxiety
.
*NL*
His
eldest
son
was
careless
and
extravagant
,
and
had
already
given
him
*NL*
much
uneasiness
;
but
his
other
children
promised
him
nothing
but
good
.
*NL*
His
daughters
,
he
felt
,
while
they
retained
the
name
of
Bertram
,
must
*NL*
be
giving
it
new
grace
,
and
in
quitting
it
,
he
trusted
,
would
extend
*NL*
its
respectable
alliances
;
and
the
character
of
Edmund
,
his
strong
good
*NL*
sense
and
uprightness
of
mind
,
bid
most
fairly
for
utility
,
honour
,
and
*NL*
happiness
to
himself
and
all
his
connexions
.
He
was
to
be
a
clergyman
.
*NL*
*NL*
Amid
the
cares
and
the
complacency
which
his
own
children
suggested
,
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
did
not
forget
to
do
what
he
could
for
the
children
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Price
:
he
assisted
her
liberally
in
the
education
and
disposal
of
her
*NL*
sons
as
they
became
old
enough
for
a
determinate
pursuit
;
and
Fanny
,
*NL*
though
almost
totally
separated
from
her
family
,
was
sensible
of
the
*NL*
truest
satisfaction
in
hearing
of
any
kindness
towards
them
,
or
of
*NL*
anything
at
all
promising
in
their
situation
or
conduct
.
Once
,
and
once
*NL*
only
,
in
the
course
of
many
years
,
had
she
the
happiness
of
being
with
*NL*
William
.
Of
the
rest
she
saw
nothing
:
nobody
seemed
to
think
of
her
ever
*NL*
going
amongst
them
again
,
even
for
a
visit
,
nobody
at
home
seemed
to
*NL*
want
her
;
but
William
determining
,
soon
after
her
removal
,
to
be
a
*NL*
sailor
,
was
invited
to
spend
a
week
with
his
sister
in
Northamptonshire
*NL*
before
he
went
to
sea
.
Their
eager
affection
in
meeting
,
their
exquisite
*NL*
delight
in
being
together
,
their
hours
of
happy
mirth
,
and
moments
of
*NL*
serious
conference
,
may
be
imagined
;
as
well
as
the
sanguine
views
and
*NL*
spirits
of
the
boy
even
to
the
last
,
and
the
misery
of
the
girl
when
he
*NL*
left
her
.
Luckily
the
visit
happened
in
the
Christmas
holidays
,
when
she
*NL*
could
directly
look
for
comfort
to
her
cousin
Edmund
;
and
he
told
her
*NL*
such
charming
things
of
what
William
was
to
do
,
and
be
hereafter
,
in
*NL*
consequence
of
his
profession
,
as
made
her
gradually
admit
that
the
*NL*
separation
might
have
some
use
.
Edmund
's
friendship
never
failed
her
:
*NL*
his
leaving
Eton
for
Oxford
made
no
change
in
his
kind
dispositions
,
and
*NL*
only
afforded
more
frequent
opportunities
of
proving
them
.
Without
any
*NL*
display
of
doing
more
than
the
rest
,
or
any
fear
of
doing
too
much
,
*NL*
he
was
always
true
to
her
interests
,
and
considerate
of
her
feelings
,
*NL*
trying
to
make
her
good
qualities
understood
,
and
to
conquer
the
*NL*
diffidence
which
prevented
their
being
more
apparent
;
giving
her
advice
,
*NL*
consolation
,
and
encouragement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Kept
back
as
she
was
by
everybody
else
,
his
single
support
could
not
*NL*
bring
her
forward
;
but
his
attentions
were
otherwise
of
the
highest
*NL*
importance
in
assisting
the
improvement
of
her
mind
,
and
extending
its
*NL*
pleasures
.
He
knew
her
to
be
clever
,
to
have
a
quick
apprehension
*NL*
as
well
as
good
sense
,
and
a
fondness
for
reading
,
which
,
properly
*NL*
directed
,
must
be
an
education
in
itself
.
Miss
Lee
taught
her
French
,
*NL*
and
heard
her
read
the
daily
portion
of
history
;
but
he
recommended
*NL*
the
books
which
charmed
her
leisure
hours
,
he
encouraged
her
taste
,
and
*NL*
corrected
her
judgment
:
he
made
reading
useful
by
talking
to
her
of
what
*NL*
she
read
,
and
heightened
its
attraction
by
judicious
praise
.
In
return
*NL*
for
such
services
she
loved
him
better
than
anybody
in
the
world
except
*NL*
William
:
her
heart
was
divided
between
the
two
.

CHAPTER
III
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
event
of
any
importance
in
the
family
was
the
death
of
Mr.
*NL*
Norris
,
which
happened
when
Fanny
was
about
fifteen
,
and
necessarily
*NL*
introduced
alterations
and
novelties
.
Mrs.
Norris
,
on
quitting
the
*NL*
Parsonage
,
removed
first
to
the
Park
,
and
afterwards
to
a
small
house
*NL*
of
Sir
Thomas
's
in
the
village
,
and
consoled
herself
for
the
loss
of
her
*NL*
husband
by
considering
that
she
could
do
very
well
without
him
;
and
for
*NL*
her
reduction
of
income
by
the
evident
necessity
of
stricter
economy
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
living
was
hereafter
for
Edmund
;
and
,
had
his
uncle
died
a
few
years
*NL*
sooner
,
it
would
have
been
duly
given
to
some
friend
to
hold
till
he
*NL*
were
old
enough
for
orders
.
But
Tom
's
extravagance
had
,
previous
to
*NL*
that
event
,
been
so
great
as
to
render
a
different
disposal
of
the
next
*NL*
presentation
necessary
,
and
the
younger
brother
must
help
to
pay
for
the
*NL*
pleasures
of
the
elder
.
There
was
another
family
living
actually
held
*NL*
for
Edmund
;
but
though
this
circumstance
had
made
the
arrangement
*NL*
somewhat
easier
to
Sir
Thomas
's
conscience
,
he
could
not
but
feel
it
to
*NL*
be
an
act
of
injustice
,
and
he
earnestly
tried
to
impress
his
eldest
son
*NL*
with
the
same
conviction
,
in
the
hope
of
its
producing
a
better
effect
*NL*
than
anything
he
had
yet
been
able
to
say
or
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
blush
for
you
,
Tom
,
''
said
he
,
in
his
most
dignified
manner
;
``
I
blush
*NL*
for
the
expedient
which
I
am
driven
on
,
and
I
trust
I
may
pity
your
*NL*
feelings
as
a
brother
on
the
occasion
.
You
have
robbed
Edmund
for
ten
,
*NL*
twenty
,
thirty
years
,
perhaps
for
life
,
of
more
than
half
the
income
*NL*
which
ought
to
be
his
.
It
may
hereafter
be
in
my
power
,
or
in
yours
*NL*
-LRB-
I
hope
it
will
-RRB-
,
to
procure
him
better
preferment
;
but
it
must
not
*NL*
be
forgotten
that
no
benefit
of
that
sort
would
have
been
beyond
his
*NL*
natural
claims
on
us
,
and
that
nothing
can
,
in
fact
,
be
an
equivalent
*NL*
for
the
certain
advantage
which
he
is
now
obliged
to
forego
through
the
*NL*
urgency
of
your
debts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
listened
with
some
shame
and
some
sorrow
;
but
escaping
as
quickly
as
*NL*
possible
,
could
soon
with
cheerful
selfishness
reflect
,
firstly
,
that
he
*NL*
had
not
been
half
so
much
in
debt
as
some
of
his
friends
;
secondly
,
that
*NL*
his
father
had
made
a
most
tiresome
piece
of
work
of
it
;
and
,
*NL*
thirdly
,
that
the
future
incumbent
,
whoever
he
might
be
,
would
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
,
die
very
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
Mr.
Norris
's
death
the
presentation
became
the
right
of
a
Dr.
Grant
,
*NL*
who
came
consequently
to
reside
at
Mansfield
;
and
on
proving
to
be
a
*NL*
hearty
man
of
forty-five
,
seemed
likely
to
disappoint
Mr.
Bertram
's
*NL*
calculations
.
But
``
no
,
he
was
a
short-necked
,
apoplectic
sort
of
fellow
,
*NL*
and
,
plied
well
with
good
things
,
would
soon
pop
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
wife
about
fifteen
years
his
junior
,
but
no
children
;
and
*NL*
they
entered
the
neighbourhood
with
the
usual
fair
report
of
being
very
*NL*
respectable
,
agreeable
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
time
was
now
come
when
Sir
Thomas
expected
his
sister-in-law
to
*NL*
claim
her
share
in
their
niece
,
the
change
in
Mrs.
Norris
's
situation
,
*NL*
and
the
improvement
in
Fanny
's
age
,
seeming
not
merely
to
do
away
any
*NL*
former
objection
to
their
living
together
,
but
even
to
give
it
the
most
*NL*
decided
eligibility
;
and
as
his
own
circumstances
were
rendered
less
*NL*
fair
than
heretofore
,
by
some
recent
losses
on
his
West
India
estate
,
in
*NL*
addition
to
his
eldest
son
's
extravagance
,
it
became
not
undesirable
*NL*
to
himself
to
be
relieved
from
the
expense
of
her
support
,
and
the
*NL*
obligation
of
her
future
provision
.
In
the
fullness
of
his
belief
that
*NL*
such
a
thing
must
be
,
he
mentioned
its
probability
to
his
wife
;
and
the
*NL*
first
time
of
the
subject
's
occurring
to
her
again
happening
to
be
when
*NL*
Fanny
was
present
,
she
calmly
observed
to
her
,
``
So
,
Fanny
,
you
are
going
*NL*
to
leave
us
,
and
live
with
my
sister
.
How
shall
you
like
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
too
much
surprised
to
do
more
than
repeat
her
aunt
's
words
,
*NL*
``
Going
to
leave
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
my
dear
;
why
should
you
be
astonished
?
You
have
been
five
years
*NL*
with
us
,
and
my
sister
always
meant
to
take
you
when
Mr.
Norris
died
.
*NL*
But
you
must
come
up
and
tack
on
my
patterns
all
the
same
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
news
was
as
disagreeable
to
Fanny
as
it
had
been
unexpected
.
She
had
*NL*
never
received
kindness
from
her
aunt
Norris
,
and
could
not
love
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
very
sorry
to
go
away
,
''
said
she
,
with
a
faltering
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
I
dare
say
you
will
;
_
that
's
_
natural
enough
.
I
suppose
you
have
*NL*
had
as
little
to
vex
you
since
you
came
into
this
house
as
any
creature
*NL*
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
I
am
not
ungrateful
,
aunt
,
''
said
Fanny
modestly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
;
I
hope
not
.
I
have
always
found
you
a
very
good
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
am
I
never
to
live
here
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Never
,
my
dear
;
but
you
are
sure
of
a
comfortable
home
.
It
can
make
*NL*
very
little
difference
to
you
,
whether
you
are
in
one
house
or
the
*NL*
other
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
left
the
room
with
a
very
sorrowful
heart
;
she
could
not
feel
the
*NL*
difference
to
be
so
small
,
she
could
not
think
of
living
with
her
aunt
*NL*
with
anything
like
satisfaction
.
As
soon
as
she
met
with
Edmund
she
told
*NL*
him
her
distress
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cousin
,
''
said
she
,
``
something
is
going
to
happen
which
I
do
not
like
*NL*
at
all
;
and
though
you
have
often
persuaded
me
into
being
reconciled
to
*NL*
things
that
I
disliked
at
first
,
you
will
not
be
able
to
do
it
now

I
am
*NL*
going
to
live
entirely
with
my
aunt
Norris

*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

my
aunt
Bertram
has
just
told
me
so

It
is
quite
settled

I
am
to

leave
Mansfield
Park
,
and
go
to
the
White
House

I
suppose
,
as
soon
as
*NL*
she
is
removed
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

Fanny

if
the
plan
were
not

you

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

*NL*
*NL*

It
has
everything

acting

woman

She
is
choosing
a
friend
and
companion
exactly
*NL*
where
she
ought

I
am
glad
her
love
of
money
does
not
interfere

You
will

``
Indeed

not

all

children

you
are
now
of
an
age

treated
better

instead
of
only
across
the
park
;
but
you
will
belong
to
us
almost
*NL*
as
much
as
ever
.
The
two
families
will
be
meeting
every
day
in
the
*NL*
year
.
The
only
difference
will
be
that
,
living
with
your
aunt
,
you
will
*NL*
necessarily
be
brought
forward
as
you
ought
to
be
.
_
Here
_
there
are
*NL*
too
many
whom
you
can
hide
behind
;
but
with
_
her
_
you
will
be
forced
to
*NL*
speak
for
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
do
not
say
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
say
it
,
and
say
it
with
pleasure
.
Mrs.
Norris
is
much
better
*NL*
fitted
than
my
mother
for
having
the
charge
of
you
now
.
She
is
of
a
*NL*
temper
to
do
a
great
deal
for
anybody
she
really
interests
herself
*NL*
about
,
and
she
will
force
you
to
do
justice
to
your
natural
powers
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
sighed
,
and
said
,
``
I
can
not
see
things
as
you
do
;
but
I
ought
to
*NL*
believe
you
to
be
right
rather
than
myself
,
and
I
am
very
much
obliged
*NL*
to
you
for
trying
to
reconcile
me
to
what
must
be
.
If
I
could
suppose
*NL*
my
aunt
really
to
care
for
me
,
it
would
be
delightful
to
feel
myself
of
*NL*
consequence
to
anybody
.
_
Here
_
,
I
know
,
I
am
of
none
,
and
yet
I
love
the
*NL*
place
so
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
place
,
Fanny
,
is
what
you
will
not
quit
,
though
you
quit
the
house
.
*NL*
You
will
have
as
free
a
command
of
the
park
and
gardens
as
ever
.
Even
*NL*
_
your
_
constant
little
heart
need
not
take
fright
at
such
a
nominal
*NL*
change
.
You
will
have
the
same
walks
to
frequent
,
the
same
library
to
*NL*
choose
from
,
the
same
people
to
look
at
,
the
same
horse
to
ride
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
.
Yes
,
dear
old
grey
pony
!
Ah
!
cousin
,
when
I
remember
how
*NL*
much
I
used
to
dread
riding
,
what
terrors
it
gave
me
to
hear
it
talked
*NL*
of
as
likely
to
do
me
good
-LRB-
oh
!
how
I
have
trembled
at
my
uncle
's
*NL*
opening
his
lips
if
horses
were
talked
of
-RRB-
,
and
then
think
of
the
kind
*NL*
pains
you
took
to
reason
and
persuade
me
out
of
my
fears
,
and
convince
*NL*
me
that
I
should
like
it
after
a
little
while
,
and
feel
how
right
you
*NL*
proved
to
be
,
I
am
inclined
to
hope
you
may
always
prophesy
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
quite
convinced
that
your
being
with
Mrs.
Norris
will
be
as
*NL*
good
for
your
mind
as
riding
has
been
for
your
health
,
and
as
much
for
*NL*
your
ultimate
happiness
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
ended
their
discourse
,
which
,
for
any
very
appropriate
service
it
*NL*
could
render
Fanny
,
might
as
well
have
been
spared
,
for
Mrs.
Norris
had
*NL*
not
the
smallest
intention
of
taking
her
.
It
had
never
occurred
to
her
,
*NL*
on
the
present
occasion
,
but
as
a
thing
to
be
carefully
avoided
.
To
*NL*
prevent
its
being
expected
,
she
had
fixed
on
the
smallest
habitation
*NL*
which
could
rank
as
genteel
among
the
buildings
of
Mansfield
parish
,
*NL*
the
White
House
being
only
just
large
enough
to
receive
herself
and
her
*NL*
servants
,
and
allow
a
spare
room
for
a
friend
,
of
which
she
made
a
*NL*
very
particular
point
.
The
spare
rooms
at
the
Parsonage
had
never
been
*NL*
wanted
,
but
the
absolute
necessity
of
a
spare
room
for
a
friend
was
now
*NL*
never
forgotten
.
Not
all
her
precautions
,
however
,
could
save
her
from
*NL*
being
suspected
of
something
better
;
or
,
perhaps
,
her
very
display
of
*NL*
the
importance
of
a
spare
room
might
have
misled
Sir
Thomas
to
suppose
*NL*
it
really
intended
for
Fanny
.
Lady
Bertram
soon
brought
the
matter
to
a
*NL*
certainty
by
carelessly
observing
to
Mrs.
Norris
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
sister
,
we
need
not
keep
Miss
Lee
any
longer
,
when
Fanny
goes
*NL*
to
live
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
almost
started
.
``
Live
with
me
,
dear
Lady
Bertram
!
what
do
*NL*
you
mean
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Is
she
not

I
thought
you
had
settled
it
with
Sir
*NL*
Thomas

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
never
.
I
never
spoke
a
syllable
about
it
to
Sir
Thomas
,
nor
he
to
*NL*
me
.
Fanny
live
with
me
!
the
last
thing
in
the
world
for
me
to
think
*NL*
of
,
or
for
anybody
to
wish
that
really
knows
us
both
.
Good
heaven

what
*NL*
could
I
do
with
Fanny
?
Me
!
a
poor
,
helpless
,
forlorn
widow
,
unfit
for
*NL*
anything
,
my
spirits
quite
broke
down
;
what
could
I
do
with
a
girl
at
*NL*
her
time
of
life

A
girl
of
fifteen

the
very
age
of
all
others
to
need
*NL*
most
attention
and
care
,
and
put
the
cheerfullest
spirits
to
the
test
!
*NL*
Sure
Sir
Thomas
could
not
seriously
expect
such
a
thing
!
Sir
Thomas
is
*NL*
too
much
my
friend
.
Nobody
that
wishes
me
well
,
I
am
sure
,
would
propose
*NL*
it

How
came
Sir
Thomas
to
speak
to
you
about
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
do
not
know

I
suppose
he
thought
it
best

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
did
he
say
?
He
could
not
say
he
_
wished

me
to
take
Fanny

I
*NL*
am
sure
in
his
heart
he
could
not
wish
me
to
do
it

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

he
only
said
he

it
very
likely

I
thought
so
too

We

both
thought
it
would
be
a
comfort
to
you
.
But
if
you
do
not
like
it
,
*NL*
there
is
no
more
to
be
said
.
She
is
no
encumbrance
here

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
sister
,
if
you
consider
my
unhappy
state
,
how
can
she
be
any
*NL*
comfort
to

Here
am
I
,
a
poor
desolate
widow
,
deprived
of
the
best
of

husbands

my
health
gone
in
attending

nursing
him

my
spirits
still
*NL*
worse

all
my
peace
in

destroyed

with
hardly
enough
to

support
me

enable
me
to
live
so
as
not

disgrace
the
memory

the
dear
departed

what
possible
comfort
could
*NL*
I
have
in
taking
such
a
charge
upon
me
as
Fanny

If
I

wish
it
for
*NL*
my
own
sake

I
would
not
do
so
unjust
a
thing
by
the
poor

She
*NL*
is
in
good
hands

sure
of
doing
well

I
must
struggle
through
my

sorrows

difficulties
as
I
can

*NL*
*NL*

Then
you
will
not

living
by
yourself

*NL*
*NL*
``
Lady
Bertram

I
do
not
complain

I
know
I
can
not
live
as
I
have
done

I
must
retrench
where
I
can

learn
to
be
a
better

_
_
been

a
liberal
housekeeper
enough

I
shall
not
be
ashamed

to
practise
economy
now

My
situation
is
as
much
altered
as
my

*NL*
A
great
many
things
were
due
from
poor
Mr.

as
clergyman
of
the
*NL*
parish

that
can
not

expected
from
me

It
is
unknown

much
was

consumed
in
our
kitchen
by
odd
comers

goers

At
the
White
House

matters

better
looked
after

live
within
my

I
shall
be
miserable

I
own
it
would
give
me
great
satisfaction
to
*NL*
be
able
to
do
rather
more
,
to
lay
by
a
little
at
the
end
of
the
year

will
be
able

put
it
quite
out
of

*NL*
besides
that

I
really
should
not
have

to
give

for
I
must
*NL*
keep
a
spare
room
for
a
friend

''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
repeated
enough
of
this
conversation
to
her
husband
to
*NL*
convince
him
how
much
he
had
mistaken
his
sister-in-law
's
views
;
and
*NL*
she
was
from
that
moment
perfectly
safe
from
all
expectation
,
or
the
*NL*
slightest
allusion
to
it
from
him
.
He
could
not
but
wonder
at
her
*NL*
refusing
to
do
anything
for
a
niece
whom
she
had
been
so
forward
to
*NL*
adopt
;
but
,
as
she
took
early
care
to
make
him
,
as
well
as
Lady
Bertram
,
*NL*
understand
that
whatever
she
possessed
was
designed
for
their
family
,
*NL*
he
soon
grew
reconciled
to
a
distinction
which
,
at
the
same
time
that
it
*NL*
was
advantageous
and
complimentary
to
them
,
would
enable
him
better
to
*NL*
provide
for
Fanny
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
soon
learnt
how
unnecessary
had
been
her
fears
of
a
removal
;
*NL*
and
her
spontaneous
,
untaught
felicity
on
the
discovery
,
conveyed
some
*NL*
consolation
to
Edmund
for
his
disappointment
in
what
he
had
expected
to
*NL*
be
so
essentially
serviceable
to
her
.
Mrs.
Norris
took
possession
of
the
*NL*
White
House
,
the
Grants
arrived
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
these
events
over
,
*NL*
everything
at
Mansfield
went
on
for
some
time
as
usual
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Grants
showing
a
disposition
to
be
friendly
and
sociable
,
gave
great
*NL*
satisfaction
in
the
main
among
their
new
acquaintance
.
They
had
their
*NL*
faults
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
soon
found
them
out
.
The
Doctor
was
very
fond
of
*NL*
eating
,
and
would
have
a
good
dinner
every
day
;
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
instead
*NL*
of
contriving
to
gratify
him
at
little
expense
,
gave
her
cook
as
high
*NL*
wages
as
they
did
at
Mansfield
Park
,
and
was
scarcely
ever
seen
in
her
*NL*
offices
.
Mrs.
Norris
could
not
speak
with
any
temper
of
such
grievances
,
*NL*
nor
of
the
quantity
of
butter
and
eggs
that
were
regularly
consumed
*NL*
in
the
house
.
``
Nobody
loved
plenty
and
hospitality
more
than
herself
;
*NL*
nobody
more
hated
pitiful
doings
;
the
Parsonage
,
she
believed
,
had
never
*NL*
been
wanting
in
comforts
of
any
sort
,
had
never
borne
a
bad
character
*NL*
in
_
her
_
_
time
_
,
but
this
was
a
way
of
going
on
that
she
could
not
*NL*
understand
.
A
fine
lady
in
a
country
parsonage
was
quite
out
of
place
.
*NL*
_
Her
_
store-room
,
she
thought
,
might
have
been
good
enough
for
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
to
go
into
.
Inquire
where
she
would
,
she
could
not
find
out
that
*NL*
Mrs.
Grant
had
ever
had
more
than
five
thousand
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
listened
without
much
interest
to
this
sort
of
invective
.
*NL*
She
could
not
enter
into
the
wrongs
of
an
economist
,
but
she
felt
all
*NL*
the
injuries
of
beauty
in
Mrs.
Grant
's
being
so
well
settled
in
life
*NL*
without
being
handsome
,
and
expressed
her
astonishment
on
that
point
*NL*
almost
as
often
,
though
not
so
diffusely
,
as
Mrs.
Norris
discussed
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
opinions
had
been
hardly
canvassed
a
year
before
another
event
*NL*
arose
of
such
importance
in
the
family
,
as
might
fairly
claim
some
place
*NL*
in
the
thoughts
and
conversation
of
the
ladies
.
Sir
Thomas
found
it
*NL*
expedient
to
go
to
Antigua
himself
,
for
the
better
arrangement
of
his
*NL*
affairs
,
and
he
took
his
eldest
son
with
him
,
in
the
hope
of
detaching
*NL*
him
from
some
bad
connexions
at
home
.
They
left
England
with
the
*NL*
probability
of
being
nearly
a
twelvemonth
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
necessity
of
the
measure
in
a
pecuniary
light
,
and
the
hope
of
its
*NL*
utility
to
his
son
,
reconciled
Sir
Thomas
to
the
effort
of
quitting
the
*NL*
rest
of
his
family
,
and
of
leaving
his
daughters
to
the
direction
of
*NL*
others
at
their
present
most
interesting
time
of
life
.
He
could
not
*NL*
think
Lady
Bertram
quite
equal
to
supply
his
place
with
them
,
or
rather
,
*NL*
to
perform
what
should
have
been
her
own
;
but
,
in
Mrs.
Norris
's
watchful
*NL*
attention
,
and
in
Edmund
's
judgment
,
he
had
sufficient
confidence
to
*NL*
make
him
go
without
fears
for
their
conduct
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
did
not
at
all
like
to
have
her
husband
leave
her
;
but
she
*NL*
was
not
disturbed
by
any
alarm
for
his
safety
,
or
solicitude
for
his
*NL*
comfort
,
being
one
of
those
persons
who
think
nothing
can
be
dangerous
,
*NL*
or
difficult
,
or
fatiguing
to
anybody
but
themselves
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Bertrams
were
much
to
be
pitied
on
the
occasion
:
not
for
their
*NL*
sorrow
,
but
for
their
want
of
it
.
Their
father
was
no
object
of
love
to
*NL*
them
;
he
had
never
seemed
the
friend
of
their
pleasures
,
and
his
absence
*NL*
was
unhappily
most
welcome
.
They
were
relieved
by
it
from
all
restraint
;
*NL*
and
without
aiming
at
one
gratification
that
would
probably
have
been
*NL*
forbidden
by
Sir
Thomas
,
they
felt
themselves
immediately
at
their
*NL*
own
disposal
,
and
to
have
every
indulgence
within
their
reach
.
Fanny
's
*NL*
relief
,
and
her
consciousness
of
it
,
were
quite
equal
to
her
cousins
'
;
*NL*
but
a
more
tender
nature
suggested
that
her
feelings
were
ungrateful
,
*NL*
and
she
really
grieved
because
she
could
not
grieve
.
``
Sir
Thomas
,
who
*NL*
had
done
so
much
for
her
and
her
brothers
,
and
who
was
gone
perhaps
*NL*
never
to
return
!
that
she
should
see
him
go
without
a
tear
!
it
was
a
*NL*
shameful
insensibility
.
''
He
had
said
to
her
,
moreover
,
on
the
very
last
*NL*
morning
,
that
he
hoped
she
might
see
William
again
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
ensuing
winter
,
and
had
charged
her
to
write
and
invite
him
to
Mansfield
*NL*
as
soon
as
the
squadron
to
which
he
belonged
should
be
known
to
be
*NL*
in
England
.
``
This
was
so
thoughtful
and
kind
!
''
and
would
he
only
have
*NL*
smiled
upon
her
,
and
called
her
``
my
dear
Fanny
,
''
while
he
said
it
,
every
*NL*
former
frown
or
cold
address
might
have
been
forgotten
.
But
he
had
ended
*NL*
his
speech
in
a
way
to
sink
her
in
sad
mortification
,
by
adding
,
``
If
*NL*
William
does
come
to
Mansfield
,
I
hope
you
may
be
able
to
convince
him
*NL*
that
the
many
years
which
have
passed
since
you
parted
have
not
been
*NL*
spent
on
your
side
entirely
without
improvement
;
though
,
I
fear
,
he
must
*NL*
find
his
sister
at
sixteen
in
some
respects
too
much
like
his
sister
at
*NL*
ten
.
''
She
cried
bitterly
over
this
reflection
when
her
uncle
was
*NL*
gone
;
and
her
cousins
,
on
seeing
her
with
red
eyes
,
set
her
down
as
a
*NL*
hypocrite
.

CHAPTER
IV
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Bertram
had
of
late
spent
so
little
of
his
time
at
home
that
he
*NL*
could
be
only
nominally
missed
;
and
Lady
Bertram
was
soon
astonished
*NL*
to
find
how
very
well
they
did
even
without
his
father
,
how
well
Edmund
*NL*
could
supply
his
place
in
carving
,
talking
to
the
steward
,
writing
to
*NL*
the
attorney
,
settling
with
the
servants
,
and
equally
saving
her
*NL*
from
all
possible
fatigue
or
exertion
in
every
particular
but
that
of
*NL*
directing
her
letters
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
earliest
intelligence
of
the
travellers
'
safe
arrival
at
Antigua
,
*NL*
after
a
favourable
voyage
,
was
received
;
though
not
before
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
had
been
indulging
in
very
dreadful
fears
,
and
trying
to
make
Edmund
*NL*
participate
them
whenever
she
could
get
him
alone
;
and
as
she
depended
*NL*
on
being
the
first
person
made
acquainted
with
any
fatal
catastrophe
,
*NL*
she
had
already
arranged
the
manner
of
breaking
it
to
all
the
others
,
*NL*
when
Sir
Thomas
's
assurances
of
their
both
being
alive
and
well
made
it
*NL*
necessary
to
lay
by
her
agitation
and
affectionate
preparatory
speeches
*NL*
for
a
while
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
winter
came
and
passed
without
their
being
called
for
;
the
accounts
*NL*
continued
perfectly
good
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
in
promoting
gaieties
for
her
*NL*
nieces
,
assisting
their
toilets
,
displaying
their
accomplishments
,
*NL*
and
looking
about
for
their
future
husbands
,
had
so
much
to
do
as
,
in
*NL*
addition
to
all
her
own
household
cares
,
some
interference
in
those
of
*NL*
her
sister
,
and
Mrs.
Grant
's
wasteful
doings
to
overlook
,
left
her
very
*NL*
little
occasion
to
be
occupied
in
fears
for
the
absent
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Bertrams
were
now
fully
established
among
the
belles
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
;
and
as
they
joined
to
beauty
and
brilliant
acquirements
*NL*
a
manner
naturally
easy
,
and
carefully
formed
to
general
civility
and
*NL*
obligingness
,
they
possessed
its
favour
as
well
as
its
admiration
.
Their
*NL*
vanity
was
in
such
good
order
that
they
seemed
to
be
quite
free
from
it
,
*NL*
and
gave
themselves
no
airs
;
while
the
praises
attending
such
behaviour
,
*NL*
secured
and
brought
round
by
their
aunt
,
served
to
strengthen
them
in
*NL*
believing
they
had
no
faults
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
did
not
go
into
public
with
her
daughters
.
She
was
too
*NL*
indolent
even
to
accept
a
mother
's
gratification
in
witnessing
their
*NL*
success
and
enjoyment
at
the
expense
of
any
personal
trouble
,
and
the
*NL*
charge
was
made
over
to
her
sister
,
who
desired
nothing
better
than
a
*NL*
post
of
such
honourable
representation
,
and
very
thoroughly
relished
*NL*
the
means
it
afforded
her
of
mixing
in
society
without
having
horses
to
*NL*
hire
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
had
no
share
in
the
festivities
of
the
season
;
but
she
enjoyed
*NL*
being
avowedly
useful
as
her
aunt
's
companion
when
they
called
away
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
family
;
and
,
as
Miss
Lee
had
left
Mansfield
,
she
naturally
*NL*
became
everything
to
Lady
Bertram
during
the
night
of
a
ball
or
a
party
.
*NL*
She
talked
to
her
,
listened
to
her
,
read
to
her
;
and
the
tranquillity
*NL*
of
such
evenings
,
her
perfect
security
in
such
a
_
tete-a-tete
_
from
any
*NL*
sound
of
unkindness
,
was
unspeakably
welcome
to
a
mind
which
had
seldom
*NL*
known
a
pause
in
its
alarms
or
embarrassments
.
As
to
her
cousins
'
*NL*
gaieties
,
she
loved
to
hear
an
account
of
them
,
especially
of
the
*NL*
balls
,
and
whom
Edmund
had
danced
with
;
but
thought
too
lowly
of
her
*NL*
own
situation
to
imagine
she
should
ever
be
admitted
to
the
same
,
and
*NL*
listened
,
therefore
,
without
an
idea
of
any
nearer
concern
in
them
.
Upon
*NL*
the
whole
,
it
was
a
comfortable
winter
to
her
;
for
though
it
brought
*NL*
no
William
to
England
,
the
never-failing
hope
of
his
arrival
was
worth
*NL*
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ensuing
spring
deprived
her
of
her
valued
friend
,
the
old
grey
pony
;
*NL*
and
for
some
time
she
was
in
danger
of
feeling
the
loss
in
her
health
as
*NL*
well
as
in
her
affections
;
for
in
spite
of
the
acknowledged
importance
*NL*
of
her
riding
on
horse-back
,
no
measures
were
taken
for
mounting
her
*NL*
again
,
``
because
,
''
as
it
was
observed
by
her
aunts
,
``
she
might
ride
one
*NL*
of
her
cousin
's
horses
at
any
time
when
they
did
not
want
them
,
''
and
as
*NL*
the
Miss
Bertrams
regularly
wanted
their
horses
every
fine
day
,
and
had
*NL*
no
idea
of
carrying
their
obliging
manners
to
the
sacrifice
of
any
real
*NL*
pleasure
,
that
time
,
of
course
,
never
came
.
They
took
their
cheerful
*NL*
rides
in
the
fine
mornings
of
April
and
May
;
and
Fanny
either
sat
at
*NL*
home
the
whole
day
with
one
aunt
,
or
walked
beyond
her
strength
at
*NL*
the
instigation
of
the
other
:
Lady
Bertram
holding
exercise
to
be
as
*NL*
unnecessary
for
everybody
as
it
was
unpleasant
to
herself
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
,
who
was
walking
all
day
,
thinking
everybody
ought
to
walk
*NL*
as
much
.
Edmund
was
absent
at
this
time
,
or
the
evil
would
have
*NL*
been
earlier
remedied
.
When
he
returned
,
to
understand
how
Fanny
was
*NL*
situated
,
and
perceived
its
ill
effects
,
there
seemed
with
him
but
one
*NL*
thing
to
be
done
;
and
that
``
Fanny
must
have
a
horse
''
was
the
resolute
*NL*
declaration
with
which
he
opposed
whatever
could
be
urged
by
the
*NL*
supineness
of
his
mother
,
or
the
economy
of
his
aunt
,
to
make
it
appear
*NL*
unimportant
.
Mrs.
Norris
could
not
help
thinking
that
some
steady
old
*NL*
thing
might
be
found
among
the
numbers
belonging
to
the
Park
that
would
*NL*
do
vastly
well
;
or
that
one
might
be
borrowed
of
the
steward
;
or
that
*NL*
perhaps
Dr.
Grant
might
now
and
then
lend
them
the
pony
he
sent
to
the
*NL*
post
.
She
could
not
but
consider
it
as
absolutely
unnecessary
,
and
even
*NL*
improper
,
that
Fanny
should
have
a
regular
lady
's
horse
of
her
own
,
in
*NL*
the
style
of
her
cousins
.
She
was
sure
Sir
Thomas
had
never
intended
it
:
*NL*
and
she
must
say
that
,
to
be
making
such
a
purchase
in
his
absence
,
and
*NL*
adding
to
the
great
expenses
of
his
stable
,
at
a
time
when
a
large
part
*NL*
of
his
income
was
unsettled
,
seemed
to
her
very
unjustifiable
.
``
Fanny
*NL*
must
have
a
horse
,
''
was
Edmund
's
only
reply
.
Mrs.
Norris
could
not
see
*NL*
it
in
the
same
light
.
Lady
Bertram
did
:
she
entirely
agreed
with
her
son
*NL*
as
to
the
necessity
of
it
,
and
as
to
its
being
considered
necessary
by
*NL*
his
father
;
she
only
pleaded
against
there
being
any
hurry
;
she
only
*NL*
wanted
him
to
wait
till
Sir
Thomas
's
return
,
and
then
Sir
Thomas
might
*NL*
settle
it
all
himself
.
He
would
be
at
home
in
September
,
and
where
would
*NL*
be
the
harm
of
only
waiting
till
September
?
*NL*
*NL*
Though
Edmund
was
much
more
displeased
with
his
aunt
than
with
his
*NL*
mother
,
as
evincing
least
regard
for
her
niece
,
he
could
not
help
paying
*NL*
more
attention
to
what
she
said
;
and
at
length
determined
on
a
method
of
*NL*
proceeding
which
would
obviate
the
risk
of
his
father
's
thinking
he
*NL*
had
done
too
much
,
and
at
the
same
time
procure
for
Fanny
the
immediate
*NL*
means
of
exercise
,
which
he
could
not
bear
she
should
be
without
.
He
had
*NL*
three
horses
of
his
own
,
but
not
one
that
would
carry
a
woman
.
Two
*NL*
of
them
were
hunters
;
the
third
,
a
useful
road-horse
:
this
third
he
*NL*
resolved
to
exchange
for
one
that
his
cousin
might
ride
;
he
knew
where
*NL*
such
a
one
was
to
be
met
with
;
and
having
once
made
up
his
mind
,
the
*NL*
whole
business
was
soon
completed
.
The
new
mare
proved
a
treasure
;
with
*NL*
a
very
little
trouble
she
became
exactly
calculated
for
the
purpose
,
*NL*
and
Fanny
was
then
put
in
almost
full
possession
of
her
.
She
had
not
*NL*
supposed
before
that
anything
could
ever
suit
her
like
the
old
grey
*NL*
pony
;
but
her
delight
in
Edmund
's
mare
was
far
beyond
any
former
*NL*
pleasure
of
the
sort
;
and
the
addition
it
was
ever
receiving
in
the
*NL*
consideration
of
that
kindness
from
which
her
pleasure
sprung
,
was
*NL*
beyond
all
her
words
to
express
.
She
regarded
her
cousin
as
an
example
*NL*
of
everything
good
and
great
,
as
possessing
worth
which
no
one
but
*NL*
herself
could
ever
appreciate
,
and
as
entitled
to
such
gratitude
from
*NL*
her
as
no
feelings
could
be
strong
enough
to
pay
.
Her
sentiments
towards
*NL*
him
were
compounded
of
all
that
was
respectful
,
grateful
,
confiding
,
and
*NL*
tender
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
the
horse
continued
in
name
,
as
well
as
fact
,
the
property
of
Edmund
,
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
could
tolerate
its
being
for
Fanny
's
use
;
and
had
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
ever
thought
about
her
own
objection
again
,
he
might
have
*NL*
been
excused
in
her
eyes
for
not
waiting
till
Sir
Thomas
's
return
in
*NL*
September
,
for
when
September
came
Sir
Thomas
was
still
abroad
,
and
*NL*
without
any
near
prospect
of
finishing
his
business
.
Unfavourable
*NL*
circumstances
had
suddenly
arisen
at
a
moment
when
he
was
beginning
to
*NL*
turn
all
his
thoughts
towards
England
;
and
the
very
great
uncertainty
*NL*
in
which
everything
was
then
involved
determined
him
on
sending
home
his
*NL*
son
,
and
waiting
the
final
arrangement
by
himself
.
Tom
arrived
safely
,
*NL*
bringing
an
excellent
account
of
his
father
's
health
;
but
to
very
little
*NL*
purpose
,
as
far
as
Mrs.
Norris
was
concerned
.
Sir
Thomas
's
sending
away
*NL*
his
son
seemed
to
her
so
like
a
parent
's
care
,
under
the
influence
of
a
*NL*
foreboding
of
evil
to
himself
,
that
she
could
not
help
feeling
dreadful
*NL*
presentiments
;
and
as
the
long
evenings
of
autumn
came
on
,
was
so
*NL*
terribly
haunted
by
these
ideas
,
in
the
sad
solitariness
of
her
cottage
,
*NL*
as
to
be
obliged
to
take
daily
refuge
in
the
dining-room
of
the
Park
.
*NL*
The
return
of
winter
engagements
,
however
,
was
not
without
its
effect
;
*NL*
and
in
the
course
of
their
progress
,
her
mind
became
so
pleasantly
*NL*
occupied
in
superintending
the
fortunes
of
her
eldest
niece
,
as
*NL*
tolerably
to
quiet
her
nerves
.
``
If
poor
Sir
Thomas
were
fated
never
to
*NL*
return
,
it
would
be
peculiarly
consoling
to
see
their
dear
Maria
well
*NL*
married
,
''
she
very
often
thought
;
always
when
they
were
in
the
company
*NL*
of
men
of
fortune
,
and
particularly
on
the
introduction
of
a
young
man
*NL*
who
had
recently
succeeded
to
one
of
the
largest
estates
and
finest
*NL*
places
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
was
from
the
first
struck
with
the
beauty
of
Miss
Bertram
,
*NL*
and
,
being
inclined
to
marry
,
soon
fancied
himself
in
love
.
He
was
*NL*
a
heavy
young
man
,
with
not
more
than
common
sense
;
but
as
there
was
*NL*
nothing
disagreeable
in
his
figure
or
address
,
the
young
lady
was
well
*NL*
pleased
with
her
conquest
.
Being
now
in
her
twenty-first
year
,
Maria
*NL*
Bertram
was
beginning
to
think
matrimony
a
duty
;
and
as
a
marriage
with
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
would
give
her
the
enjoyment
of
a
larger
income
than
her
*NL*
father
's
,
as
well
as
ensure
her
the
house
in
town
,
which
was
now
a
prime
*NL*
object
,
it
became
,
by
the
same
rule
of
moral
obligation
,
her
evident
*NL*
duty
to
marry
Mr.
Rushworth
if
she
could
.
Mrs.
Norris
was
most
zealous
*NL*
in
promoting
the
match
,
by
every
suggestion
and
contrivance
likely
to
*NL*
enhance
its
desirableness
to
either
party
;
and
,
among
other
means
,
by
*NL*
seeking
an
intimacy
with
the
gentleman
's
mother
,
who
at
present
lived
*NL*
with
him
,
and
to
whom
she
even
forced
Lady
Bertram
to
go
through
ten
*NL*
miles
of
indifferent
road
to
pay
a
morning
visit
.
It
was
not
long
before
*NL*
a
good
understanding
took
place
between
this
lady
and
herself
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
acknowledged
herself
very
desirous
that
her
son
should
marry
,
*NL*
and
declared
that
of
all
the
young
ladies
she
had
ever
seen
,
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
seemed
,
by
her
amiable
qualities
and
accomplishments
,
the
best
*NL*
adapted
to
make
him
happy
.
Mrs.
Norris
accepted
the
compliment
,
*NL*
and
admired
the
nice
discernment
of
character
which
could
so
well
*NL*
distinguish
merit
.
Maria
was
indeed
the
pride
and
delight
of
them
*NL*
all
--
perfectly
faultless
--
an
angel
;
and
,
of
course
,
so
surrounded
by
*NL*
admirers
,
must
be
difficult
in
her
choice
:
but
yet
,
as
far
as
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
could
allow
herself
to
decide
on
so
short
an
acquaintance
,
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
appeared
precisely
the
young
man
to
deserve
and
attach
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dancing
with
each
other
at
a
proper
number
of
balls
,
the
young
*NL*
people
justified
these
opinions
,
and
an
engagement
,
with
a
due
reference
*NL*
to
the
absent
Sir
Thomas
,
was
entered
into
,
much
to
the
satisfaction
*NL*
of
their
respective
families
,
and
of
the
general
lookers-on
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
who
had
,
for
many
weeks
past
,
felt
the
expediency
of
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
marrying
Miss
Bertram
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
some
months
before
Sir
Thomas
's
consent
could
be
received
;
but
,
*NL*
in
the
meanwhile
,
as
no
one
felt
a
doubt
of
his
most
cordial
pleasure
*NL*
in
the
connexion
,
the
intercourse
of
the
two
families
was
carried
*NL*
on
without
restraint
,
and
no
other
attempt
made
at
secrecy
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
's
talking
of
it
everywhere
as
a
matter
not
to
be
talked
of
at
*NL*
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
the
only
one
of
the
family
who
could
see
a
fault
in
the
*NL*
business
;
but
no
representation
of
his
aunt
's
could
induce
him
to
find
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
a
desirable
companion
.
He
could
allow
his
sister
to
be
*NL*
the
best
judge
of
her
own
happiness
,
but
he
was
not
pleased
that
her
*NL*
happiness
should
centre
in
a
large
income
;
nor
could
he
refrain
from
*NL*
often
saying
to
himself
,
in
Mr.
Rushworth
's
company
--
``
If
this
man
had
*NL*
not
twelve
thousand
a
year
,
he
would
be
a
very
stupid
fellow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
however
,
was
truly
happy
in
the
prospect
of
an
alliance
*NL*
so
unquestionably
advantageous
,
and
of
which
he
heard
nothing
but
the
*NL*
perfectly
good
and
agreeable
.
It
was
a
connexion
exactly
of
the
right
*NL*
sort
--
in
the
same
county
,
and
the
same
interest
--
and
his
most
hearty
*NL*
concurrence
was
conveyed
as
soon
as
possible
.
He
only
conditioned
that
*NL*
the
marriage
should
not
take
place
before
his
return
,
which
he
was
again
*NL*
looking
eagerly
forward
to
.
He
wrote
in
April
,
and
had
strong
hopes
*NL*
of
settling
everything
to
his
entire
satisfaction
,
and
leaving
Antigua
*NL*
before
the
end
of
the
summer
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
state
of
affairs
in
the
month
of
July
;
and
Fanny
had
just
*NL*
reached
her
eighteenth
year
,
when
the
society
of
the
village
received
*NL*
an
addition
in
the
brother
and
sister
of
Mrs.
Grant
,
a
Mr.
and
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
,
the
children
of
her
mother
by
a
second
marriage
.
They
were
*NL*
young
people
of
fortune
.
The
son
had
a
good
estate
in
Norfolk
,
the
*NL*
daughter
twenty
thousand
pounds
.
As
children
,
their
sister
had
been
*NL*
always
very
fond
of
them
;
but
,
as
her
own
marriage
had
been
soon
*NL*
followed
by
the
death
of
their
common
parent
,
which
left
them
to
the
*NL*
care
of
a
brother
of
their
father
,
of
whom
Mrs.
Grant
knew
nothing
,
she
*NL*
had
scarcely
seen
them
since
.
In
their
uncle
's
house
they
had
found
a
*NL*
kind
home
.
Admiral
and
Mrs.
Crawford
,
though
agreeing
in
nothing
else
,
*NL*
were
united
in
affection
for
these
children
,
or
,
at
least
,
were
no
*NL*
farther
adverse
in
their
feelings
than
that
each
had
their
favourite
,
to
*NL*
whom
they
showed
the
greatest
fondness
of
the
two
.
The
Admiral
delighted
*NL*
in
the
boy
,
Mrs.
Crawford
doted
on
the
girl
;
and
it
was
the
lady
's
death
*NL*
which
now
obliged
her
_
protegee
_
,
after
some
months
'
further
trial
at
*NL*
her
uncle
's
house
,
to
find
another
home
.
Admiral
Crawford
was
a
man
of
*NL*
vicious
conduct
,
who
chose
,
instead
of
retaining
his
niece
,
to
bring
his
*NL*
mistress
under
his
own
roof
;
and
to
this
Mrs.
Grant
was
indebted
for
her
*NL*
sister
's
proposal
of
coming
to
her
,
a
measure
quite
as
welcome
on
one
*NL*
side
as
it
could
be
expedient
on
the
other
;
for
Mrs.
Grant
,
having
by
*NL*
this
time
run
through
the
usual
resources
of
ladies
residing
in
the
*NL*
country
without
a
family
of
children
--
having
more
than
filled
her
*NL*
favourite
sitting-room
with
pretty
furniture
,
and
made
a
choice
*NL*
collection
of
plants
and
poultry
--
was
very
much
in
want
of
some
variety
*NL*
at
home
.
The
arrival
,
therefore
,
of
a
sister
whom
she
had
always
loved
,
*NL*
and
now
hoped
to
retain
with
her
as
long
as
she
remained
single
,
was
*NL*
highly
agreeable
;
and
her
chief
anxiety
was
lest
Mansfield
should
not
*NL*
satisfy
the
habits
of
a
young
woman
who
had
been
mostly
used
to
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
was
not
entirely
free
from
similar
apprehensions
,
though
*NL*
they
arose
principally
from
doubts
of
her
sister
's
style
of
living
and
*NL*
tone
of
society
;
and
it
was
not
till
after
she
had
tried
in
vain
to
*NL*
persuade
her
brother
to
settle
with
her
at
his
own
country
house
,
*NL*
that
she
could
resolve
to
hazard
herself
among
her
other
relations
.
To
*NL*
anything
like
a
permanence
of
abode
,
or
limitation
of
society
,
Henry
*NL*
Crawford
had
,
unluckily
,
a
great
dislike
:
he
could
not
accommodate
his
*NL*
sister
in
an
article
of
such
importance
;
but
he
escorted
her
,
with
the
*NL*
utmost
kindness
,
into
Northamptonshire
,
and
as
readily
engaged
to
fetch
*NL*
her
away
again
,
at
half
an
hour
's
notice
,
whenever
she
were
weary
of
the
*NL*
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
was
very
satisfactory
on
each
side
.
Miss
Crawford
found
a
*NL*
sister
without
preciseness
or
rusticity
,
a
sister
's
husband
who
looked
*NL*
the
gentleman
,
and
a
house
commodious
and
well
fitted
up
;
and
Mrs.
Grant
*NL*
received
in
those
whom
she
hoped
to
love
better
than
ever
a
young
man
*NL*
and
woman
of
very
prepossessing
appearance
.
Mary
Crawford
was
remarkably
*NL*
pretty
;
Henry
,
though
not
handsome
,
had
air
and
countenance
;
the
manners
*NL*
of
both
were
lively
and
pleasant
,
and
Mrs.
Grant
immediately
gave
them
*NL*
credit
for
everything
else
.
She
was
delighted
with
each
,
but
Mary
was
*NL*
her
dearest
object
;
and
having
never
been
able
to
glory
in
beauty
of
her
*NL*
own
,
she
thoroughly
enjoyed
the
power
of
being
proud
of
her
sister
's
.
*NL*
She
had
not
waited
her
arrival
to
look
out
for
a
suitable
match
for
her
:
*NL*
she
had
fixed
on
Tom
Bertram
;
the
eldest
son
of
a
baronet
was
not
too
*NL*
good
for
a
girl
of
twenty
thousand
pounds
,
with
all
the
elegance
*NL*
and
accomplishments
which
Mrs.
Grant
foresaw
in
her
;
and
being
a
*NL*
warm-hearted
,
unreserved
woman
,
Mary
had
not
been
three
hours
in
the
*NL*
house
before
she
told
her
what
she
had
planned
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
was
glad
to
find
a
family
of
such
consequence
so
very
near
*NL*
them
,
and
not
at
all
displeased
either
at
her
sister
's
early
care
,
or
*NL*
the
choice
it
had
fallen
on
.
Matrimony
was
her
object
,
provided
she
*NL*
could
marry
well
:
and
having
seen
Mr.
Bertram
in
town
,
she
knew
that
*NL*
objection
could
no
more
be
made
to
his
person
than
to
his
situation
in
*NL*
life
.
While
she
treated
it
as
a
joke
,
therefore
,
she
did
not
forget
to
*NL*
think
of
it
seriously
.
The
scheme
was
soon
repeated
to
Henry
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
now
,
''
added
Mrs.
Grant
,
``
I
have
thought
of
something
to
make
it
*NL*
complete
.
I
should
dearly
love
to
settle
you
both
in
this
country
;
and
*NL*
therefore
,
Henry
,
you
shall
marry
the
youngest
Miss
Bertram
,
a
nice
,
*NL*
handsome
,
good-humoured
,
accomplished
girl
,
who
will
make
you
very
*NL*
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
bowed
and
thanked
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
sister
,
''
said
Mary
,
``
if
you
can
persuade
him
into
anything
*NL*
of
the
sort
,
it
will
be
a
fresh
matter
of
delight
to
me
to
find
myself
*NL*
allied
to
anybody
so
clever
,
and
I
shall
only
regret
that
you
have
*NL*
not
half
a
dozen
daughters
to
dispose
of
.
If
you
can
persuade
Henry
*NL*
to
marry
,
you
must
have
the
address
of
a
Frenchwoman
.
All
that
English
*NL*
abilities
can
do
has
been
tried
already
.
I
have
three
very
particular
*NL*
friends
who
have
been
all
dying
for
him
in
their
turn
;
and
the
pains
*NL*
which
they

their
mothers
-LRB-
very
clever
women
-RRB-

as
well
as
my
dear
aunt

myself

have
taken
to
reason

or
trick
him
into
marrying
,
is
*NL*
inconceivable
!
He
is
the
most
horrible
flirt
that
can
be
imagined
.
If
*NL*
your
Miss
Bertrams
do
not
like
to
have
their
hearts
broke

let
them
*NL*
avoid
Henry

*NL*
``
No

sure

are

good

You

You

will
allow
for
the
doubts
of
youth

inexperience

I
am
of
a
cautious

temper

happiness

Nobody
can

think
more
highly

I
consider

most
justly

detestable

Mrs.

Dr.

laughingly

state

CHAPTER
V
*NL*
*NL*
The
young
people
were
pleased
with
each
other
from
the
first
.
On
each
*NL*
side
there
was
much
to
attract
,
and
their
acquaintance
soon
promised
as
*NL*
early
an
intimacy
as
good
manners
would
warrant
.
Miss
Crawford
's
beauty
*NL*
did
her
no
disservice
with
the
Miss
Bertrams
.
They
were
too
handsome
*NL*
themselves
to
dislike
any
woman
for
being
so
too
,
and
were
almost
as
*NL*
much
charmed
as
their
brothers
with
her
lively
dark
eye
,
clear
brown
*NL*
complexion
,
and
general
prettiness
.
Had
she
been
tall
,
full
formed
,
and
*NL*
fair
,
it
might
have
been
more
of
a
trial
:
but
as
it
was
,
there
could
be
*NL*
no
comparison
;
and
she
was
most
allowably
a
sweet
,
pretty
girl
,
while
*NL*
they
were
the
finest
young
women
in
the
country
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
was
not
handsome
:
no
,
when
they
first
saw
him
he
was
*NL*
absolutely
plain
,
black
and
plain
;
but
still
he
was
the
gentleman
,
with
*NL*
a
pleasing
address
.
The
second
meeting
proved
him
not
so
very
plain
:
*NL*
he
was
plain
,
to
be
sure
,
but
then
he
had
so
much
countenance
,
and
his
*NL*
teeth
were
so
good
,
and
he
was
so
well
made
,
that
one
soon
forgot
he
was
*NL*
plain
;
and
after
a
third
interview
,
after
dining
in
company
with
him
at
*NL*
the
Parsonage
,
he
was
no
longer
allowed
to
be
called
so
by
anybody
.
He
*NL*
was
,
in
fact
,
the
most
agreeable
young
man
the
sisters
had
ever
known
,
*NL*
and
they
were
equally
delighted
with
him
.
Miss
Bertram
's
engagement
made
*NL*
him
in
equity
the
property
of
Julia
,
of
which
Julia
was
fully
aware
;
and
*NL*
before
he
had
been
at
Mansfield
a
week
,
she
was
quite
ready
to
be
fallen
*NL*
in
love
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
's
notions
on
the
subject
were
more
confused
and
indistinct
.
She
*NL*
did
not
want
to
see
or
understand
.
``
There
could
be
no
harm
in
her
liking
*NL*
an
agreeable
man
--
everybody
knew
her
situation
--
Mr.
Crawford
must
take
*NL*
care
of
himself
.
''
Mr.
Crawford
did
not
mean
to
be
in
any
danger
!
the
*NL*
Miss
Bertrams
were
worth
pleasing
,
and
were
ready
to
be
pleased
;
and
he
*NL*
began
with
no
object
but
of
making
them
like
him
.
He
did
not
want
them
*NL*
to
die
of
love
;
but
with
sense
and
temper
which
ought
to
have
made
him
*NL*
judge
and
feel
better
,
he
allowed
himself
great
latitude
on
such
points
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
like

*NL*
*NL*
The
Crawfords
,
without
wanting
to
be
cured
,
were
very
willing
to
stay
.
*NL*
Mary
was
satisfied
with
the
Parsonage
as
a
present
home
,
and
Henry
*NL*
equally
ready
to
lengthen
his
visit
.
He
had
come
,
intending
to
spend
*NL*
only
a
few
days
with
them
;
but
Mansfield
promised
well
,
and
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
call
him
elsewhere
.
It
delighted
Mrs.
Grant
to
keep
them
both
*NL*
with
her
,
and
Dr.
Grant
was
exceedingly
well
contented
to
have
it
so
:
a
*NL*
talking
pretty
young
woman
like
Miss
Crawford
is
always
pleasant
society
*NL*
to
an
indolent
,
stay-at-home
man
;
and
Mr.
Crawford
's
being
his
guest
was
*NL*
an
excuse
for
drinking
claret
every
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Miss
Bertrams
'
admiration
of
Mr.
Crawford
was
more
rapturous
than
*NL*
anything
which
Miss
Crawford
's
habits
made
her
likely
to
feel
.
She
*NL*
acknowledged
,
however
,
that
the
Mr.
Bertrams
were
very
fine
young
men
,
*NL*
that
two
such
young
men
were
not
often
seen
together
even
in
London
,
and
*NL*
that
their
manners
,
particularly
those
of
the
eldest
,
were
very
good
.
*NL*
_
He
_
had
been
much
in
London
,
and
had
more
liveliness
and
gallantry
than
*NL*
Edmund
,
and
must
,
therefore
,
be
preferred
;
and
,
indeed
,
his
being
the
*NL*
eldest
was
another
strong
claim
.
She
had
felt
an
early
presentiment
that
*NL*
she
_
should
_
like
the
eldest
best
.
She
knew
it
was
her
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
Bertram
must
have
been
thought
pleasant
,
indeed
,
at
any
rate
;
he
was
*NL*
the
sort
of
young
man
to
be
generally
liked
,
his
agreeableness
was
of
*NL*
the
kind
to
be
oftener
found
agreeable
than
some
endowments
of
a
higher
*NL*
stamp
,
for
he
had
easy
manners
,
excellent
spirits
,
a
large
acquaintance
,
*NL*
and
a
great
deal
to
say
;
and
the
reversion
of
Mansfield
Park
,
and
a
*NL*
baronetcy
,
did
no
harm
to
all
this
.
Miss
Crawford
soon
felt
that
he
and
*NL*
his
situation
might
do
.
She
looked
about
her
with
due
consideration
,
and
*NL*
found
almost
everything
in
his
favour
:
a
park
,
a
real
park
,
five
miles
*NL*
round
,
a
spacious
modern-built
house
,
so
well
placed
and
well
screened
*NL*
as
to
deserve
to
be
in
any
collection
of
engravings
of
gentlemen
's
*NL*
seats
in
the
kingdom
,
and
wanting
only
to
be
completely
new
*NL*
furnished
--
pleasant
sisters
,
a
quiet
mother
,
and
an
agreeable
man
*NL*
himself
--
with
the
advantage
of
being
tied
up
from
much
gaming
at
present
*NL*
by
a
promise
to
his
father
,
and
of
being
Sir
Thomas
hereafter
.
It
*NL*
might
do
very
well
;
she
believed
she
should
accept
him
;
and
she
began
*NL*
accordingly
to
interest
herself
a
little
about
the
horse
which
he
had
to
*NL*
run
at
the
B
--
races
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
races
were
to
call
him
away
not
long
after
their
acquaintance
*NL*
began
;
and
as
it
appeared
that
the
family
did
not
,
from
his
usual
goings
*NL*
on
,
expect
him
back
again
for
many
weeks
,
it
would
bring
his
passion
to
*NL*
an
early
proof
.
Much
was
said
on
his
side
to
induce
her
to
attend
the
*NL*
races
,
and
schemes
were
made
for
a
large
party
to
them
,
with
all
the
*NL*
eagerness
of
inclination
,
but
it
would
only
do
to
be
talked
of
.
*NL*
*NL*
And
Fanny
,
what
was
_
she
_
doing
and
thinking
all
this
while
?
and
what
*NL*
was
_
her
_
opinion
of
the
newcomers
?
Few
young
ladies
of
eighteen
could
*NL*
be
less
called
on
to
speak
their
opinion
than
Fanny
.
In
a
quiet
way
,
*NL*
very
little
attended
to
,
she
paid
her
tribute
of
admiration
to
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
beauty
;
but
as
she
still
continued
to
think
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
very
plain
,
in
spite
of
her
two
cousins
having
repeatedly
proved
the
*NL*
contrary
,
she
never
mentioned
_
him
_
.
The
notice
,
which
she
excited
*NL*
herself
,
was
to
this
effect
.
``
I
begin
now
to
understand
you
all
,
*NL*
except
Miss
Price
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
as
she
was
walking
with
the
Mr.
*NL*
Bertrams
.
``
Pray
,
is
she
out
,
or
is
she
not
?
I
am
puzzled
.
She
dined
at
*NL*
the
Parsonage
,
with
the
rest
of
you
,
which
seemed
like
being
_
out
_
;
and
*NL*
yet
she
says
so
little
,
that
I
can
hardly
suppose
she
_
is
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
,
to
whom
this
was
chiefly
addressed
,
replied
,
``
I
believe
I
know
*NL*
what
you
mean
,
but
I
will
not
undertake
to
answer
the
question
.
My
*NL*
cousin
is
grown
up
.
She
has
the
age
and
sense
of
a
woman
,
but
the
outs
*NL*
and
not
outs
are
beyond
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
yet
,
in
general
,
nothing
can
be
more
easily
ascertained
.
The
*NL*
distinction
is
so
broad
.
Manners
as
well
as
appearance
are
,
generally
*NL*
speaking
,
so
totally
different
.
Till
now
,
I
could
not
have
supposed
it
*NL*
possible
to
be
mistaken
as
to
a
girl
's
being
out
or
not
.
A
girl
not
out
*NL*
has
always
the
same
sort
of
dress
:
a
close
bonnet
,
for
instance
;
looks
*NL*
very
demure
,
and
never
says
a
word
.
You
may
smile
,
but
it
is
so
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
;
and
except
that
it
is
sometimes
carried
a
little
too
far
,
*NL*
it
is
all
very
proper
.
Girls
should
be
quiet
and
modest
.
The
most
*NL*
objectionable
part
is
,
that
the
alteration
of
manners
on
being
*NL*
introduced
into
company
is
frequently
too
sudden
.
They
sometimes
pass
in
*NL*
such
very
little
time
from
reserve
to
quite
the
opposite
--
to
confidence
!
*NL*
_
That
_
is
the
faulty
part
of
the
present
system
.
One
does
not
like
to
*NL*
see
a
girl
of
eighteen
or
nineteen
so
immediately
up
to
every
thing
--
and
*NL*
perhaps
when
one
has
seen
her
hardly
able
to
speak
the
year
before
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
,
I
dare
say
_
you
_
have
sometimes
met
with
such
changes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
I
have
,
but
this
is
hardly
fair
;
I
see
what
you
are
at
.
You
*NL*
are
quizzing
me
and
Miss
Anderson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed

Miss
Anderson
!
I
do
not
know
who
or
what
you
mean
.
I
am
*NL*
quite
in
the
dark
.
But
I
_
will
_
quiz
you
with
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
,
*NL*
if
you
will
tell
me
what
about
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
you
carry
it
off
very
well
,
but
I
can
not
be
quite
so
far
imposed
*NL*
on
.
You
must
have
had
Miss
Anderson
in
your
eye
,
in
describing
an
*NL*
altered
young
lady
.
You
paint
too
accurately
for
mistake
.
It
was
exactly
*NL*
so
.
The
Andersons
of
Baker
Street
.
We
were
speaking
of
them
the
other
*NL*
day
,
you
know
.
Edmund
,
you
have
heard
me
mention
Charles
Anderson
.
*NL*
The
circumstance
was
precisely
as
this
lady
has
represented
it
.
When
*NL*
Anderson
first
introduced
me
to
his
family
,
about
two
years
ago
,
his
*NL*
sister
was
not
_
out
_
,
and
I
could
not
get
her
to
speak
to
me
.
I
sat
*NL*
there
an
hour
one
morning
waiting
for
Anderson
,
with
only
her
and
a
*NL*
little
girl
or
two
in
the
room
,
the
governess
being
sick
or
run
away
,
*NL*
and
the
mother
in
and
out
every
moment
with
letters
of
business
,
and
I
*NL*
could
hardly
get
a
word
or
a
look
from
the
young
lady
--
nothing
like
a
*NL*
civil
answer
--
she
screwed
up
her
mouth
,
and
turned
from
me
with
such
an
*NL*
air
!
I
did
not
see
her
again
for
a
twelvemonth
.
She
was
then
_
out
_
.
I
*NL*
met
her
at
Mrs.
Holford
's
,
and
did
not
recollect
her
.
She
came
up
to
me
,
*NL*
claimed
me
as
an
acquaintance
,
stared
me
out
of
countenance
;
and
talked
*NL*
and
laughed
till
I
did
not
know
which
way
to
look
.
I
felt
that
I
must
*NL*
be
the
jest
of
the
room
at
the
time
,
and
Miss
Crawford
,
it
is
plain
,
has
*NL*
heard
the
story
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
a
very
pretty
story
it
is
,
and
with
more
truth
in
it
,
I
dare
say
,
*NL*
than
does
credit
to
Miss
Anderson
.
It
is
too
common
a
fault
.
Mothers
*NL*
certainly
have
not
yet
got
quite
the
right
way
of
managing
their
*NL*
daughters
.
I
do
not
know
where
the
error
lies
.
I
do
not
pretend
to
set
*NL*
people
right
,
but
I
do
see
that
they
are
often
wrong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Those
who
are
showing
the
world
what
female
manners

should
_
be

''
said
*NL*
Mr.
Bertram
gallantly
,
``
are
doing
a
great
deal
to
set
them
right
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
error
is
plain
enough
,
''
said
the
less
courteous
Edmund
;
``
such
girls
*NL*
are
ill
brought
up
.
They
are
given
wrong
notions
from
the
beginning
.
*NL*
They
are
always
acting
upon
motives
of
vanity
,
and
there
is
no
more
*NL*
real
modesty
in
their
behaviour
_
before
_
they
appear
in
public
than
*NL*
afterwards
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
replied
Miss
Crawford
hesitatingly
.
``
Yes
,
I
can
not
*NL*
agree
with
you
there
.
It
is
certainly
the
modestest
part
of
the
*NL*
business
.
It
is
much
worse
to
have
girls
not
out
give
themselves
the
*NL*
same
airs
and
take
the
same
liberties
as
if
they
were
,
which
I
have
seen
*NL*
done
.
That
is
worse
than
anything
--
quite
disgusting
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
_
that
_
is
very
inconvenient
indeed
,
''
said
Mr.
Bertram
.
``
It
leads
*NL*
one
astray
;
one
does
not
know
what
to
do
.
The
close
bonnet
and
demure
*NL*
air
you
describe
so
well
-LRB-
and
nothing
was
ever
juster
-RRB-
,
tell
one
what
*NL*
is
expected
;
but
I
got
into
a
dreadful
scrape
last
year
from
the
want
of
*NL*
them
.
I
went
down
to
Ramsgate
for
a
week
with
a
friend
last
September
,
*NL*
just
after
my
return
from
the
West
Indies
.
My
friend
Sneyd
--
you
have
*NL*
heard
me
speak
of
Sneyd
,
Edmund
--
his
father
,
and
mother
,
and
sisters
,
*NL*
were
there
,
all
new
to
me
.
When
we
reached
Albion
Place
they
were
out
;
*NL*
we
went
after
them
,
and
found
them
on
the
pier
:
Mrs.
and
the
two
Miss
*NL*
Sneyds
,
with
others
of
their
acquaintance
.
I
made
my
bow
in
form
;
and
*NL*
as
Mrs.
Sneyd
was
surrounded
by
men
,
attached
myself
to
one
of
her
*NL*
daughters
,
walked
by
her
side
all
the
way
home
,
and
made
myself
as
*NL*
agreeable
as
I
could
;
the
young
lady
perfectly
easy
in
her
manners
,
and
*NL*
as
ready
to
talk
as
to
listen
.
I
had
not
a
suspicion
that
I
could
be
*NL*
doing
anything
wrong
.
They
looked
just
the
same
:
both
well-dressed
,
with
*NL*
veils
and
parasols
like
other
girls
;
but
I
afterwards
found
that
I
had
*NL*
been
giving
all
my
attention
to
the
youngest
,
who
was
not
_
out
_
,
and
*NL*
had
most
excessively
offended
the
eldest
.
Miss
Augusta
ought
not
to
have
*NL*
been
noticed
for
the
next
six
months
;
and
Miss
Sneyd
,
I
believe
,
has
*NL*
never
forgiven
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
was
bad
indeed
.
Poor
Miss
Sneyd
.
Though
I
have
no
younger
*NL*
sister
,
I
feel
for
her
.
To
be
neglected
before
one
's
time
must
be
very
*NL*
vexatious
;
but
it
was
entirely
the
mother
's
fault
.
Miss
Augusta
should
*NL*
have
been
with
her
governess
.
Such
half-and-half
doings
never
prosper
.
*NL*
But
now
I
must
be
satisfied
about
Miss
Price
.
Does
she
go
to
balls
?
Does
*NL*
she
dine
out
every
where
,
as
well
as
at
my
sister
's
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
replied
Edmund
;
``
I
do
not
think
she
has
ever
been
to
a
ball
.
My
*NL*
mother
seldom
goes
into
company
herself
,
and
dines
nowhere
but
with
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
,
and
Fanny
stays
at
home
with
_
her
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
then
the
point
is
clear
.
Miss
Price
is
not
out
.

CHAPTER
VI
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Bertram
set
off
for
--------
,
and
Miss
Crawford
was
prepared
to
*NL*
find
a
great
chasm
in
their
society
,
and
to
miss
him
decidedly
in
the
*NL*
meetings
which
were
now
becoming
almost
daily
between
the
families
;
*NL*
and
on
their
all
dining
together
at
the
Park
soon
after
his
going
,
she
*NL*
retook
her
chosen
place
near
the
bottom
of
the
table
,
fully
expecting
to
*NL*
feel
a
most
melancholy
difference
in
the
change
of
masters
.
It
would
*NL*
be
a
very
flat
business
,
she
was
sure
.
In
comparison
with
his
brother
,
*NL*
Edmund
would
have
nothing
to
say
.
The
soup
would
be
sent
round
in
a
most
*NL*
spiritless
manner
,
wine
drank
without
any
smiles
or
agreeable
trifling
,
*NL*
and
the
venison
cut
up
without
supplying
one
pleasant
anecdote
of
any
*NL*
former
haunch
,
or
a
single
entertaining
story
,
about
``
my
friend
such
a
*NL*
one
.
''
She
must
try
to
find
amusement
in
what
was
passing
at
the
upper
*NL*
end
of
the
table
,
and
in
observing
Mr.
Rushworth
,
who
was
now
making
his
*NL*
appearance
at
Mansfield
for
the
first
time
since
the
Crawfords
'
arrival
.
*NL*
He
had
been
visiting
a
friend
in
the
neighbouring
county
,
and
that
*NL*
friend
having
recently
had
his
grounds
laid
out
by
an
improver
,
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
was
returned
with
his
head
full
of
the
subject
,
and
very
eager
*NL*
to
be
improving
his
own
place
in
the
same
way
;
and
though
not
saying
*NL*
much
to
the
purpose
,
could
talk
of
nothing
else
.
The
subject
had
*NL*
been
already
handled
in
the
drawing-room
;
it
was
revived
in
the
*NL*
dining-parlour
.
Miss
Bertram
's
attention
and
opinion
was
evidently
his
*NL*
chief
aim
;
and
though
her
deportment
showed
rather
conscious
superiority
*NL*
than
any
solicitude
to
oblige
him
,
the
mention
of
Sotherton
Court
,
*NL*
and
the
ideas
attached
to
it
,
gave
her
a
feeling
of
complacency
,
which
*NL*
prevented
her
from
being
very
ungracious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
could
see
Compton
,
''
said
he
;
``
it
is
the
most
complete
thing
!
*NL*
I
never
saw
a
place
so
altered
in
my
life
.
I
told
Smith
I
did
not
know
*NL*
where
I
was
.
The
approach
_
now
_
,
is
one
of
the
finest
things
in
the
*NL*
country
:
you
see
the
house
in
the
most
surprising
manner
.
I
declare
,
*NL*
when
I
got
back
to
Sotherton
yesterday
,
it
looked
like
a
prison
--
quite
a
*NL*
dismal
old
prison
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
,
for
shame
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
.
``
A
prison
indeed
?
Sotherton
Court
is
*NL*
the
noblest
old
place
in
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
wants
improvement
,
ma'am
,
beyond
anything
.
I
never
saw
a
place
that
*NL*
wanted
so
much
improvement
in
my
life
;
and
it
is
so
forlorn
that
I
do
*NL*
not
know
what
can
be
done
with
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
wonder
that
Mr.
Rushworth
should
think
so
at
present
,
''
said
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
to
Mrs.
Norris
,
with
a
smile
;
``
but
depend
upon
it
,
Sotherton
will
*NL*
have
_
every
_
improvement
in
time
which
his
heart
can
desire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
try
to
do
something
with
it
,
''
said
Mr.
Rushworth
,
``
but
I
do
not
*NL*
know
what
.
I
hope
I
shall
have
some
good
friend
to
help
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
best
friend
upon
such
an
occasion
,
''
said
Miss
Bertram
calmly
,
*NL*
``
would
be
Mr.
Repton
,
I
imagine
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
what
I
was
thinking
of
.
As
he
has
done
so
well
by
Smith
,
I
*NL*
think
I
had
better
have
him
at
once
.
His
terms
are
five
guineas
a
day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
and
if
they
were
_
ten
_
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
I
am
sure
_
you
_
need
*NL*
not
regard
it
.
The
expense
need
not
be
any
impediment
.
If
I
were
you
,
*NL*
I
should
not
think
of
the
expense
.
I
would
have
everything
done
in
the
*NL*
best
style
,
and
made
as
nice
as
possible
.
Such
a
place
as
Sotherton
*NL*
Court
deserves
everything
that
taste
and
money
can
do
.
You
have
space
to
*NL*
work
upon
there
,
and
grounds
that
will
well
reward
you
.
For
my
own
part
,
*NL*
if
I
had
anything
within
the
fiftieth
part
of
the
size
of
Sotherton
,
I
*NL*
should
be
always
planting
and
improving
,
for
naturally
I
am
excessively
*NL*
fond
of
it
.
It
would
be
too
ridiculous
for
me
to
attempt
anything
where
*NL*
I
am
now
,
with
my
little
half
acre
.
It
would
be
quite
a
burlesque
.
But
*NL*
if
I
had
more
room
,
I
should
take
a
prodigious
delight
in
improving
and
*NL*
planting
.
We
did
a
vast
deal
in
that
way
at
the
Parsonage
:
we
made
it
*NL*
quite
a
different
place
from
what
it
was
when
we
first
had
it
.
You
young
*NL*
ones
do
not
remember
much
about
it
,
perhaps
;
but
if
dear
Sir
Thomas
were
*NL*
here
,
he
could
tell
you
what
improvements
we
made
:
and
a
great
deal
more
*NL*
would
have
been
done
,
but
for
poor
Mr.
Norris
's
sad
state
of
health
.
*NL*
He
could
hardly
ever
get
out
,
poor
man
,
to
enjoy
anything
,
and
_
that
_
*NL*
disheartened
me
from
doing
several
things
that
Sir
Thomas
and
I
used
to
*NL*
talk
of
.
If
it
had
not
been
for
_
that
_
,
we
should
have
carried
on
the
*NL*
garden
wall
,
and
made
the
plantation
to
shut
out
the
churchyard
,
just
*NL*
as
Dr.
Grant
has
done
.
We
were
always
doing
something
as
it
was
.
It
was
*NL*
only
the
spring
twelvemonth
before
Mr.
Norris
's
death
that
we
put
in
the
*NL*
apricot
against
the
stable
wall
,
which
is
now
grown
such
a
noble
tree
,
*NL*
and
getting
to
such
perfection
,
sir
,
''
addressing
herself
then
to
Dr.
*NL*
Grant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
tree
thrives
well
,
beyond
a
doubt
,
madam
,
''
replied
Dr.
Grant
.
``
The
*NL*
soil
is
good
;
and
I
never
pass
it
without
regretting
that
the
fruit
*NL*
should
be
so
little
worth
the
trouble
of
gathering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
it
is
a
Moor
Park
,
we
bought
it
as
a
Moor
Park
,
and
it
cost
*NL*
us
--
that
is
,
it
was
a
present
from
Sir
Thomas
,
but
I
saw
the
bill
--
and
I
*NL*
know
it
cost
seven
shillings
,
and
was
charged
as
a
Moor
Park
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
imposed
on
,
ma'am
,
''
replied
Dr.
Grant
:
``
these
potatoes
have
as
*NL*
much
the
flavour
of
a
Moor
Park
apricot
as
the
fruit
from
that
tree
.
It
*NL*
is
an
insipid
fruit
at
the
best
;
but
a
good
apricot
is
eatable
,
which
*NL*
none
from
my
garden
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grant
,
pretending
to
whisper
across
*NL*
the
table
to
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
that
Dr.
Grant
hardly
knows
what
the
natural
*NL*
taste
of
our
apricot
is
:
he
is
scarcely
ever
indulged
with
one
,
for
it
*NL*
is
so
valuable
a
fruit
;
with
a
little
assistance
,
and
ours
is
such
a
*NL*
remarkably
large
,
fair
sort
,
that
what
with
early
tarts
and
preserves
,
*NL*
my
cook
contrives
to
get
them
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
had
begun
to
redden
,
was
appeased
;
and
,
for
a
little
*NL*
while
,
other
subjects
took
place
of
the
improvements
of
Sotherton
.
Dr.
*NL*
Grant
and
Mrs.
Norris
were
seldom
good
friends
;
their
acquaintance
had
*NL*
begun
in
dilapidations
,
and
their
habits
were
totally
dissimilar
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
interruption
Mr.
Rushworth
began
again
.
``
Smith
's
place
*NL*
is
the
admiration
of
all
the
country
;
and
it
was
a
mere
nothing
before
*NL*
Repton
took
it
in
hand
.
I
think
I
shall
have
Repton
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Rushworth
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
,
``
if
I
were
you
,
I
would
have
a
*NL*
very
pretty
shrubbery
.
One
likes
to
get
out
into
a
shrubbery
in
fine
*NL*
weather
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
was
eager
to
assure
her
ladyship
of
his
acquiescence
,
and
*NL*
tried
to
make
out
something
complimentary
;
but
,
between
his
submission
*NL*
to
_
her
_
taste
,
and
his
having
always
intended
the
same
himself
,
with
*NL*
the
superadded
objects
of
professing
attention
to
the
comfort
of
ladies
*NL*
in
general
,
and
of
insinuating
that
there
was
one
only
whom
he
was
*NL*
anxious
to
please
,
he
grew
puzzled
,
and
Edmund
was
glad
to
put
an
end
*NL*
to
his
speech
by
a
proposal
of
wine
.
Mr.
Rushworth
,
however
,
though
not
*NL*
usually
a
great
talker
,
had
still
more
to
say
on
the
subject
next
his
*NL*
heart
.
``
Smith
has
not
much
above
a
hundred
acres
altogether
in
his
*NL*
grounds
,
which
is
little
enough
,
and
makes
it
more
surprising
that
the
*NL*
place
can
have
been
so
improved
.
Now
,
at
Sotherton
we
have
a
good
seven
*NL*
hundred
,
without
reckoning
the
water
meadows
;
so
that
I
think
,
if
so
*NL*
much
could
be
done
at
Compton
,
we
need
not
despair
.
There
have
been
two
*NL*
or
three
fine
old
trees
cut
down
,
that
grew
too
near
the
house
,
and
*NL*
it
opens
the
prospect
amazingly
,
which
makes
me
think
that
Repton
,
or
*NL*
anybody
of
that
sort
,
would
certainly
have
the
avenue
at
Sotherton
down
:
*NL*
the
avenue
that
leads
from
the
west
front
to
the
top
of
the
hill
,
*NL*
you
know
,
''
turning
to
Miss
Bertram
particularly
as
he
spoke
.
But
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
thought
it
most
becoming
to
reply
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
avenue
!
Oh
!
I
do
not
recollect
it

I
really
know
very
little

was
sitting
on

other
side
of
Edmund
,
exactly
opposite
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
,
and
who
had
been
attentively
listening
,
now
looked
at
*NL*
him
,
and
said
in
a
low
voice
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cut
down
an
avenue
!
What
a
pity
!
Does
it
not
make
you
think
of
Cowper
?
*NL*
`
Ye
fallen
avenues
,
once
more
I
mourn
your
fate
unmerited
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
smiled
as
he
answered
,
``
I
am
afraid
the
avenue
stands
a
bad
chance
,
*NL*
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
like
to
see
Sotherton
before
it
is
cut
down
,
to
see
the
place
*NL*
as
it
is
now
,
in
its
old
state
;
but
I
do
not
suppose
I
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
never
been
there
?
No
,
you
never
can
;
and
,
unluckily
,
it
is
out
*NL*
of
distance
for
a
ride
.
I
wish
we
could
contrive
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
it
does
not
signify
.
Whenever
I
do
see
it
,
you
will
tell
me
how
it
*NL*
has
been
altered
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
collect
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
``
that
Sotherton
is
an
old
place
,
and
a
*NL*
place
of
some
grandeur
.
In
any
particular
style
of
building
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
house
was
built
in
Elizabeth
's
time
,
and
is
a
large
,
regular
,
brick
*NL*
building
;
heavy
,
but
respectable
looking
,
and
has
many
good
rooms
.
It
*NL*
is
ill
placed
.
It
stands
in
one
of
the
lowest
spots
of
the
park
;
in
that
*NL*
respect
,
unfavourable
for
improvement
.
But
the
woods
are
fine
,
and
*NL*
there
is
a
stream
,
which
,
I
dare
say
,
might
be
made
a
good
deal
of
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
is
quite
right
,
I
think
,
in
meaning
to
give
it
a
modern
dress
,
*NL*
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
it
will
be
all
done
extremely
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
listened
with
submission
,
and
said
to
herself
,
``
He
is
a
*NL*
well-bred
man
;
he
makes
the
best
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
wish
to
influence
Mr.
Rushworth
,
''
he
continued
;
``
but
,
had
I
*NL*
a
place
to
new
fashion
,
I
should
not
put
myself
into
the
hands
of
an
*NL*
improver
.
I
would
rather
have
an
inferior
degree
of
beauty
,
of
my
own

choice
,
and
acquired
progressively

I
would
rather
abide
by

*NL*

would
know
what
you
were
about

of
course

that
would
not

suit

me

I
have
no
eye
or
ingenuity
for
such
matters

as
they
are
*NL*
before
me
;
and
had
I
a
place
of
my
own
in
the
country

I
should
be
most
*NL*
thankful
to
any
Mr.
Repton
who
would
undertake
it
,
and
give
me
as
much
*NL*
beauty
as
he
could
for
my
money
;
and
I
should
never
look
at
it
till
it
*NL*
was
complete

*NL*
*NL*
``
It
would
be
delightful
to
_
me
_
to
see
the
progress
of
it
all
,

said
*NL*
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ay
,
you
have
been
brought
up
to
it

It
was
no
part
of
my
education
;
and
*NL*
the
only
dose
I
ever
had
,
being
administered
by
not
the
first
favourite
*NL*
in
the
world
,
has
made
me
consider
improvements
_
in
_
_
hand
_
as
the
*NL*
greatest
of
nuisances
.
Three
years
ago
the
Admiral
,
my
honoured
uncle
,
*NL*
bought
a
cottage
at
Twickenham
for
us
all
to
spend
our
summers
in
;
*NL*
and
my
aunt
and
I
went
down
to
it
quite
in
raptures
;
but
it
being
*NL*
excessively
pretty
,
it
was
soon
found
necessary
to
be
improved
,
and
for
*NL*
three
months
we
were
all
dirt
and
confusion
,
without
a
gravel
walk
to
*NL*
step
on
,
or
a
bench
fit
for
use
.
I
would
have
everything
as
complete
*NL*
as
possible
in
the
country
,
shrubberies
and
flower-gardens
,
and
rustic
*NL*
seats
innumerable
:
but
it
must
all
be
done
without
my
care
.
Henry
is
*NL*
different
;
he
loves
to
be
doing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
sorry
to
hear
Miss
Crawford
,
whom
he
was
much
disposed
to
*NL*
admire
,
speak
so
freely
of
her
uncle
.
It
did
not
suit
his
sense
of
*NL*
propriety
,
and
he
was
silenced
,
till
induced
by
further
smiles
and
*NL*
liveliness
to
put
the
matter
by
for
the
present
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Bertram
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
have
tidings
of
my
harp
at
last
.
I
am
*NL*
assured
that
it
is
safe
at
Northampton
;
and
there
it
has
probably
been
*NL*
these
ten
days
,
in
spite
of
the
solemn
assurances
we
have
so
often
*NL*
received
to
the
contrary
.
''
Edmund
expressed
his
pleasure
and
surprise
.
*NL*
``
The
truth
is
,
that
our
inquiries
were
too
direct
;
we
sent
a
servant
,
*NL*
we
went
ourselves
:
this
will
not
do
seventy
miles
from
London
;
but
this
*NL*
morning
we
heard
of
it
in
the
right
way
.
It
was
seen
by
some
farmer
,
and
*NL*
he
told
the
miller
,
and
the
miller
told
the
butcher
,
and
the
butcher
's
*NL*
son-in-law
left
word
at
the
shop
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
glad
that
you
have
heard
of
it

there
will
be
no
further
delay
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
to
have
it
to-morrow
;
but
how
do
you
think
it
is
to
be
conveyed
?
*NL*
Not
by
a
wagon
or
cart
:
oh
no
!
nothing
of
that
kind
could
be
hired
in
*NL*
the
village
.
I
might
as
well
have
asked
for
porters
and
a
handbarrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
would
find
it
difficult
,
I
dare
say
,
just
now
,
in
the
middle
of
a
*NL*
very
late
hay
harvest
,
to
hire
a
horse
and
cart
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
astonished
to
find
what
a
piece
of
work
was
made
of
it
!
To
want
*NL*
a
horse
and
cart
in
the
country
seemed
impossible
,
so
I
told
my
maid
to
*NL*
speak
for
one
directly
;
and
as
I
can
not
look
out
of
my
dressing-closet
*NL*
without
seeing
one
farmyard
,
nor
walk
in
the
shrubbery
without
passing
*NL*
another
,
I
thought
it
would
be
only
ask
and
have
,
and
was
rather
grieved
*NL*
that
I
could
not
give
the
advantage
to
all
.
Guess
my
surprise
,
when
*NL*
I
found
that
I
had
been
asking
the
most
unreasonable
,
most
impossible
*NL*
thing
in
the
world
;
had
offended
all
the
farmers
,
all
the
labourers
,
*NL*
all
the
hay
in
the
parish
!
As
for
Dr.
Grant
's
bailiff
,
I
believe
I
had
*NL*
better
keep
out
of
_
his
_
way
;
and
my
brother-in-law
himself
,
who
is
all
*NL*
kindness
in
general
,
looked
rather
black
upon
me
when
he
found
what
I
*NL*
had
been
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
could
not
be
expected
to
have
thought
on
the
subject
before
;
but
*NL*
when
you
_
do
_
think
of
it
,
you
must
see
the
importance
of
getting
in
*NL*
the
grass
.
The
hire
of
a
cart
at
any
time
might
not
be
so
easy
as
you
*NL*
suppose
:
our
farmers
are
not
in
the
habit
of
letting
them
out
;
but
,
in
*NL*
harvest
,
it
must
be
quite
out
of
their
power
to
spare
a
horse
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
understand
all
your
ways
in
time

but
,
coming
down
with
the
*NL*
true
London
maxim
,
that
everything
is
to
be
got
with
money
,
I
was
a
*NL*
little
embarrassed
at
first
by
the
sturdy
independence
of
your
country
*NL*
customs

However
,
I
am
to
have
my
harp
fetched
to-morrow

Henry

who
is
*NL*
good-nature
itself
,
has
offered
to
fetch
it
in
his
barouche
.
Will
it
not
*NL*
be
honourably
conveyed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
spoke
of
the
harp
as
his
favourite
instrument
,
and
hoped
to
be
*NL*
soon
allowed
to
hear
her
.
Fanny
had
never
heard
the
harp
at
all
,
and
*NL*
wished
for
it
very
much
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
be
most
happy
to
play
to
you
both

said
Miss
Crawford
;
``
at
*NL*
least
as
long
as
you
can
like

listen

probably
much
longer

for
*NL*
I
dearly
love
music
myself
,
and
where
the
natural
taste
is
equal
the
*NL*
player
must
always
be
best
off
,
for
she
is
gratified
in
more
ways
than
*NL*
one
.
Now
,
Mr.
Bertram
,
if
you
write
to
your
brother
,
I
entreat
you
to
*NL*
tell
him
that
my

heard
so
much
of
my
misery
about
it

And
you
may
say
,
if
you
please
,
that
I
shall
prepare
my
most
plaintive

airs
against
his
return

in
compassion

his
feelings

I
know
his
*NL*
horse
will
lose

foresee

No

The
occasion
would
*NL*
never
be
foreseen

What
strange
creatures

are

You
would
not
*NL*
write
to
each

upon
the
most
urgent
necessity

take
up
the

such
a

ill

Fanny
would
rather
have
had
Edmund
tell
the
story

his
determined
*NL*
silence
obliged
her
to
relate
her
brother
's
situation
:
her
voice
was
*NL*
animated
in
speaking
of
his
profession
,
and
the
foreign
stations
he
had
*NL*
been
on
;
but
she
could
not
mention
the
number
of
years
that
he
had
been
*NL*
absent
without
tears
in
her
eyes
.
Miss
Crawford
civilly
wished
him
an
*NL*
early
promotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
know
anything
of
my
cousin
's
captain

''
said
Edmund
;
``
Captain
*NL*
Marshall
?
You
have
a
large
acquaintance
in
the
navy

I
conclude
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Among

large
enough

they
do
not
belong

Of
various
admirals
I
could
tell

you
a
great
deal

of
them

their
flags

the
gradation

their
bickerings

jealousies

,
in
general
,
I
can
assure
*NL*
you
that
they
are
all
passed
over

all
very
ill
used

my

again
felt
grave

replied

Yes

well
enough

the

discretion
in
spending
it
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
*NL*
is
not
a
favourite
profession

mine

It
has
never
worn
an
amiable
form

Edmund
reverted
to
the
harp

was
again
very
happy
in
the
prospect
of
*NL*
hearing
her
play

*NL*
The
subject
of
improving
grounds
,
meanwhile
,
was
still
under
*NL*
consideration
among
the
others
;

Mrs.
Grant
could
not
help
addressing

her
brother

it
was
calling
his
attention
from
Miss

*NL*
Bertram

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

yourself

from
what
I
hear

it

vie

Everingham

fond
of
the
sort
of
thing

Julia
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excessively
;
but
what
with
the
natural
advantages
of
the
ground
,
which
*NL*
pointed
out
,
even
to
a
very
young
eye
,
what
little
remained
to
be
done
,
*NL*
and
my
own
consequent
resolutions
,
I
had
not
been
of
age
three
*NL*
months
before
Everingham
was
all
that
it
is
now

My
plan
was
laid
*NL*
at
Westminster
,
a
little
altered
,
perhaps
,
at
Cambridge
,
and
at
*NL*
one-and-twenty
executed
.
I
am
inclined
to
envy
Mr.
Rushworth
for
having
*NL*
so
much
happiness
yet
before
him
.
I
have
been
a
devourer
of
my
own
.

Julia
.
''
_
You
_
can
never
want
employment
.
Instead
of
envying
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
,
you
should
assist
him
with
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grant
,
hearing
the
latter
part
of
this
speech
,
enforced
it
warmly
,
*NL*
persuaded
that
no
judgment
could
be
equal
to
her
brother
's
;
and
as
*NL*
Miss
Bertram
caught
at
the
idea
likewise
,
and
gave
it
her
full
support
,
*NL*
declaring
that
,
in
her
opinion
,
it
was
infinitely
better
to
consult
*NL*
with
friends
and
disinterested
advisers
,
than
immediately
to
throw
the
*NL*
business
into
the
hands
of
a
professional
man
,
Mr.
Rushworth
was
very
*NL*
ready
to
request
the
favour
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
assistance
;
and
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
,
after
properly
depreciating
his
own
abilities
,
was
quite
at
*NL*
his
service
in
any
way
that
could
be
useful
.
Mr.
Rushworth
then
began
to
*NL*
propose
Mr.
Crawford
's
doing
him
the
honour
of
coming
over
to
Sotherton
,
*NL*
and
taking
a
bed
there
;
when
Mrs.
Norris
,
as
if
reading
in
her
two
*NL*
nieces
'
minds
their
little
approbation
of
a
plan
which
was
to
take
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
away
,
interposed
with
an
amendment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
can
be
no
doubt
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
willingness
;
but
why
should
not
*NL*
more
of
us
go
?
Why
should
not
we
make
a
little
party
?
Here
are
many
that
*NL*
would
be
interested
in
your
improvements
,
my
dear
Mr.
Rushworth
,
and
*NL*
that
would
like
to
hear
Mr.
Crawford
's
opinion
on
the
spot
,
and
that
*NL*
might
be
of
some
small
use
to
you
with
_
their
_
opinions
;
and
,
for
my
*NL*
own
part
,
I
have
been
long
wishing
to
wait
upon
your
good
mother
again
;
*NL*
nothing
but
having
no
horses
of
my
own
could
have
made
me
so
remiss

*NL*
now
I
could
go

sit
a
few
hours
with
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
while
the
rest
*NL*
of
you
walked
about
and
settled
things
,
and
then
we
could
all
return
*NL*
to
a
late
dinner
here
,
or
dine
at
Sotherton
,
just
as
might
be
most
*NL*
agreeable
to
your
mother
,
and
have
a
pleasant
drive
home
by
moonlight
.
*NL*
I
dare
say
Mr.
Crawford
would
take
my
two
nieces
and
me
in
his
barouche
,
*NL*

Edmund
can
go
on
horseback
,
you
know

Fanny
will
stay
at

home
with
you

*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
made
no
objection

every
one
concerned
in

going

forward

expressing
their
ready

heard
it
all

said
nothing

CHAPTER
VII
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Fanny
,
and
how
do
you
like
Miss
Crawford
_
now
_
?
''
said
Edmund
the
*NL*
next
day
,
after
thinking
some
time
on
the
subject
himself
.
``
How
did
you
*NL*
like
her
yesterday
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
--
very
much
.
I
like
to
hear
her
talk
.
She
entertains
me
;
and
*NL*
she
is
so
extremely
pretty
,
that
I
have
great
pleasure
in
looking
at
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
her
countenance
that
is
so
attractive
.
She
has
a
wonderful
play
*NL*
of
feature
!
But
was
there
nothing
in
her
conversation
that
struck
you
,
*NL*
Fanny
,
as
not
quite
right
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
she
ought
not
to
have
spoken
of
her
uncle
as
she
did
.
I
was
*NL*
quite
astonished
.
An
uncle
with
whom
she
has
been
living
so
many
years
,
*NL*
and
who
,
whatever
his
faults
may
be
,
is
so
very
fond
of
her
brother
,
*NL*
treating
him
,
they
say
,
quite
like
a
son
.
I
could
not
have
believed
it
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
thought
you
would
be
struck
.
It
was
very
wrong
;
very
indecorous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
very
ungrateful
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ungrateful
is
a
strong
word
.
I
do
not
know
that
her
uncle
has
any
claim
*NL*
to
her
_
gratitude
_
;
his
wife
certainly
had
;
and
it
is
the
warmth
of
her
*NL*
respect
for
her
aunt
's
memory
which
misleads
her
here
.
She
is
awkwardly
*NL*
circumstanced
.
With
such
warm
feelings
and
lively
spirits
it
must
be
*NL*
difficult
to
do
justice
to
her
affection
for
Mrs.
Crawford
,
without
*NL*
throwing
a
shade
on
the
Admiral
.
I
do
not
pretend
to
know
which
was
most
*NL*
to
blame
in
their
disagreements
,
though
the
Admiral
's
present
conduct
*NL*
might
incline
one
to
the
side
of
his
wife
;
but
it
is
natural
and
amiable
*NL*
that
Miss
Crawford
should
acquit
her
aunt
entirely
.
I
do
not
censure
her
*NL*
_
opinions
_
;
but
there
certainly
_
is
_
impropriety
in
making
them
public
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
you
think
,
''
said
Fanny
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
``
that
this
*NL*
impropriety
is
a
reflection
itself
upon
Mrs.
Crawford
,
as
her
niece
has
*NL*
been
entirely
brought
up
by
her
?
She
can
not
have
given
her
right
notions
*NL*
of
what
was
due
to
the
Admiral
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
fair
remark
.
Yes
,
we
must
suppose
the
faults
of
the
niece
*NL*
to
have
been
those
of
the
aunt
;
and
it
makes
one
more
sensible
of
the
*NL*
disadvantages
she
has
been
under
.
But
I
think
her
present
home
must
*NL*
do
her
good
.
Mrs.
Grant
's
manners
are
just
what
they
ought
to
be
.
She
*NL*
speaks
of
her
brother
with
a
very
pleasing
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
except
as
to
his
writing
her
such
short
letters
.
She
made
me
*NL*
almost
laugh
;
but
I
can
not
rate
so
very
highly
the
love
or
good-nature
*NL*
of
a
brother
who
will
not
give
himself
the
trouble
of
writing
anything
*NL*
worth
reading
to
his
sisters
,
when
they
are
separated
.
I
am
sure
William
*NL*
would
never
have
used
_
me
_
so
,
under
any
circumstances
.
And
what
right
*NL*
had
she
to
suppose
that
_
you
_
would
not
write
long
letters
when
you
were
*NL*
absent
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
right
of
a
lively
mind
,
Fanny
,
seizing
whatever
may
contribute
*NL*
to
its
own
amusement
or
that
of
others
;
perfectly
allowable
,
when
*NL*
untinctured
by
ill-humour
or
roughness
;
and
there
is
not
a
shadow
of
*NL*
either
in
the
countenance
or
manner
of
Miss
Crawford
:
nothing
sharp
,
or
*NL*
loud
,
or
coarse
.
She
is
perfectly
feminine
,
except
in
the
instances
we
*NL*
have
been
speaking
of
.
There
she
can
not
be
justified
.
I
am
glad
you
saw
*NL*
it
all
as
I
did
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Having
formed
her
mind
and
gained
her
affections
,
he
had
a
good
chance
*NL*
of
her
thinking
like
him
;
though
at
this
period
,
and
on
this
subject
,
*NL*
there
began
now
to
be
some
danger
of
dissimilarity
,
for
he
was
in
a
line
*NL*
of
admiration
of
Miss
Crawford
,
which
might
lead
him
where
Fanny
*NL*
could
not
follow
.
Miss
Crawford
's
attractions
did
not
lessen
.
The
harp
*NL*
arrived
,
and
rather
added
to
her
beauty
,
wit
,
and
good-humour
;
for
she
*NL*
played
with
the
greatest
obligingness
,
with
an
expression
and
taste
*NL*
which
were
peculiarly
becoming
,
and
there
was
something
clever
to
be
*NL*
said
at
the
close
of
every
air
.
Edmund
was
at
the
Parsonage
every
day
,
*NL*
to
be
indulged
with
his
favourite
instrument
:
one
morning
secured
an
*NL*
invitation
for
the
next
;
for
the
lady
could
not
be
unwilling
to
have
a
*NL*
listener
,
and
every
thing
was
soon
in
a
fair
train
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
young
woman
,
pretty
,
lively
,
with
a
harp
as
elegant
as
herself
,
and
*NL*
both
placed
near
a
window
,
cut
down
to
the
ground
,
and
opening
on
a
*NL*
little
lawn
,
surrounded
by
shrubs
in
the
rich
foliage
of
summer
,
was
*NL*
enough
to
catch
any
man
's
heart
.
The
season
,
the
scene
,
the
air
,
were
*NL*
all
favourable
to
tenderness
and
sentiment
.
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
tambour
*NL*
frame
were
not
without
their
use
:
it
was
all
in
harmony
;
and
as
*NL*
everything
will
turn
to
account
when
love
is
once
set
going
,
even
the
*NL*
sandwich
tray
,
and
Dr.
Grant
doing
the
honours
of
it
,
were
worth
looking
*NL*
at
.
Without
studying
the
business
,
however
,
or
knowing
what
he
was
*NL*
about
,
Edmund
was
beginning
,
at
the
end
of
a
week
of
such
intercourse
,
*NL*
to
be
a
good
deal
in
love
;
and
to
the
credit
of
the
lady
it
may
be
added
*NL*
that
,
without
his
being
a
man
of
the
world
or
an
elder
brother
,
without
*NL*
any
of
the
arts
of
flattery
or
the
gaieties
of
small
talk
,
he
began
to
*NL*
be
agreeable
to
her
.
She
felt
it
to
be
so
,
though
she
had
not
foreseen
,
*NL*
and
could
hardly
understand
it
;
for
he
was
not
pleasant
by
any
common
*NL*
rule
:
he
talked
no
nonsense
;
he
paid
no
compliments
;
his
opinions
*NL*
were
unbending
,
his
attentions
tranquil
and
simple
.
There
was
a
charm
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
in
his
sincerity
,
his
steadiness
,
his
integrity
,
which
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
might
be
equal
to
feel
,
though
not
equal
to
discuss
with
*NL*
herself
.
She
did
not
think
very
much
about
it
,
however
:
he
pleased
her
*NL*
for
the
present
;
she
liked
to
have
him
near
her
;
it
was
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
wonder
that
Edmund
was
at
the
Parsonage
every
morning
;
*NL*
she
would
gladly
have
been
there
too
,
might
she
have
gone
in
uninvited
*NL*
and
unnoticed
,
to
hear
the
harp
;
neither
could
she
wonder
that
,
when
the
*NL*
evening
stroll
was
over
,
and
the
two
families
parted
again
,
he
should
*NL*
think
it
right
to
attend
Mrs.
Grant
and
her
sister
to
their
home
,
while
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
was
devoted
to
the
ladies
of
the
Park
;
but
she
thought
it
*NL*
a
very
bad
exchange
;
and
if
Edmund
were
not
there
to
mix
the
wine
and
*NL*
water
for
her
,
would
rather
go
without
it
than
not
.
She
was
a
little
*NL*
surprised
that
he
could
spend
so
many
hours
with
Miss
Crawford
,
and
*NL*
not
see
more
of
the
sort
of
fault
which
he
had
already
observed
,
and
of
*NL*
which
_
she
_
was
almost
always
reminded
by
a
something
of
the
same
nature
*NL*
whenever
she
was
in
her
company
;
but
so
it
was
.
Edmund
was
fond
of
*NL*
speaking
to
her
of
Miss
Crawford
,
but
he
seemed
to
think
it
enough
that
*NL*
the
Admiral
had
since
been
spared
;
and
she
scrupled
to
point
out
her
own
*NL*
remarks
to
him
,
lest
it
should
appear
like
ill-nature
.
The
first
actual
*NL*
pain
which
Miss
Crawford
occasioned
her
was
the
consequence
of
an
*NL*
inclination
to
learn
to
ride
,
which
the
former
caught
,
soon
after
her
*NL*
being
settled
at
Mansfield
,
from
the
example
of
the
young
ladies
at
the
*NL*
Park
,
and
which
,
when
Edmund
's
acquaintance
with
her
increased
,
led
to
*NL*
his
encouraging
the
wish
,
and
the
offer
of
his
own
quiet
mare
for
the
*NL*
purpose
of
her
first
attempts
,
as
the
best
fitted
for
a
beginner
that
*NL*
either
stable
could
furnish
.
No
pain
,
no
injury
,
however
,
was
designed
*NL*
by
him
to
his
cousin
in
this
offer
:
_
she
_
was
not
to
lose
a
day
's
*NL*
exercise
by
it
.
The
mare
was
only
to
be
taken
down
to
the
Parsonage
half
*NL*
an
hour
before
her
ride
were
to
begin
;
and
Fanny
,
on
its
being
first
*NL*
proposed
,
so
far
from
feeling
slighted
,
was
almost
over-powered
with
*NL*
gratitude
that
he
should
be
asking
her
leave
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
made
her
first
essay
with
great
credit
to
herself
,
and
no
*NL*
inconvenience
to
Fanny
.
Edmund
,
who
had
taken
down
the
mare
and
presided
*NL*
at
the
whole
,
returned
with
it
in
excellent
time
,
before
either
Fanny
or
*NL*
the
steady
old
coachman
,
who
always
attended
her
when
she
rode
without
*NL*
her
cousins
,
were
ready
to
set
forward
.
The
second
day
's
trial
was
not
*NL*
so
guiltless
.
Miss
Crawford
's
enjoyment
of
riding
was
such
that
she
did
*NL*
not
know
how
to
leave
off
.
Active
and
fearless
,
and
though
rather
small
,
*NL*
strongly
made
,
she
seemed
formed
for
a
horsewoman
;
and
to
the
pure
*NL*
genuine
pleasure
of
the
exercise
,
something
was
probably
added
in
*NL*
Edmund
's
attendance
and
instructions
,
and
something
more
in
the
*NL*
conviction
of
very
much
surpassing
her
sex
in
general
by
her
early
*NL*
progress
,
to
make
her
unwilling
to
dismount
.
Fanny
was
ready
and
*NL*
waiting
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
was
beginning
to
scold
her
for
not
being
gone
,
*NL*
and
still
no
horse
was
announced
,
no
Edmund
appeared
.
To
avoid
her
aunt
,
*NL*
and
look
for
him
,
she
went
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
houses
,
though
scarcely
half
a
mile
apart
,
were
not
within
sight
of
*NL*
each
other
;
but
,
by
walking
fifty
yards
from
the
hall
door
,
she
could
*NL*
look
down
the
park
,
and
command
a
view
of
the
Parsonage
and
all
its
*NL*
demesnes
,
gently
rising
beyond
the
village
road
;
and
in
Dr.
Grant
's
*NL*
meadow
she
immediately
saw
the
group
--
Edmund
and
Miss
Crawford
both
on
*NL*
horse-back
,
riding
side
by
side
,
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
*NL*
with
two
or
three
grooms
,
standing
about
and
looking
on
.
A
happy
party
*NL*
it
appeared
to
her
,
all
interested
in
one
object
:
cheerful
beyond
a
*NL*
doubt
,
for
the
sound
of
merriment
ascended
even
to
her
.
It
was
a
sound
*NL*
which
did
not
make
_
her
_
cheerful
;
she
wondered
that
Edmund
should
*NL*
forget
her
,
and
felt
a
pang
.
She
could
not
turn
her
eyes
from
the
*NL*
meadow
;
she
could
not
help
watching
all
that
passed
.
At
first
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
and
her
companion
made
the
circuit
of
the
field
,
which
was
not
*NL*
small
,
at
a
foot
's
pace
;
then
,
at
_
her
_
apparent
suggestion
,
they
rose
*NL*
into
a
canter
;
and
to
Fanny
's
timid
nature
it
was
most
astonishing
to
*NL*
see
how
well
she
sat
.
After
a
few
minutes
they
stopped
entirely
.
Edmund
*NL*
was
close
to
her
;
he
was
speaking
to
her
;
he
was
evidently
directing
her
*NL*
management
of
the
bridle
;
he
had
hold
of
her
hand
;
she
saw
it
,
or
the
*NL*
imagination
supplied
what
the
eye
could
not
reach
.
She
must
not
wonder
*NL*
at
all
this
;
what
could
be
more
natural
than
that
Edmund
should
be
*NL*
making
himself
useful
,
and
proving
his
good-nature
by
any
one
?
She
could
*NL*
not
but
think
,
indeed
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
might
as
well
have
saved
him
*NL*
the
trouble
;
that
it
would
have
been
particularly
proper
and
becoming
*NL*
in
a
brother
to
have
done
it
himself
;
but
Mr.
Crawford
,
with
all
his
*NL*
boasted
good-nature
,
and
all
his
coachmanship
,
probably
knew
nothing
*NL*
of
the
matter
,
and
had
no
active
kindness
in
comparison
of
Edmund
.
She
*NL*
began
to
think
it
rather
hard
upon
the
mare
to
have
such
double
duty
;
if
*NL*
she
were
forgotten
,
the
poor
mare
should
be
remembered
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
feelings
for
one
and
the
other
were
soon
a
little
tranquillised
*NL*
by
seeing
the
party
in
the
meadow
disperse
,
and
Miss
Crawford
still
on
*NL*
horseback
,
but
attended
by
Edmund
on
foot
,
pass
through
a
gate
into
the
*NL*
lane
,
and
so
into
the
park
,
and
make
towards
the
spot
where
she
stood
.
*NL*
She
began
then
to
be
afraid
of
appearing
rude
and
impatient
;
and
walked
*NL*
to
meet
them
with
a
great
anxiety
to
avoid
the
suspicion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Miss
Price
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
as
soon
as
she
was
at
all
*NL*
within
hearing
,
``
I
am
come
to
make
my
own
apologies
for
keeping
you
*NL*
waiting
;
but
I
have
nothing
in
the
world
to
say
for
myself
--
I
knew
it
*NL*
was
very
late
,
and
that
I
was
behaving
extremely
ill
;
and
therefore
,
if
*NL*
you
please
,
you
must
forgive
me
.
Selfishness
must
always
be
forgiven
,
*NL*
you
know
,
because
there
is
no
hope
of
a
cure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
answer
was
extremely
civil
,
and
Edmund
added
his
conviction
that
*NL*
she
could
be
in
no
hurry
.
``
For
there
is
more
than
time
enough
for
my
*NL*
cousin
to
ride
twice
as
far
as
she
ever
goes
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
you
have
*NL*
been
promoting
her
comfort
by
preventing
her
from
setting
off
half
an
*NL*
hour
sooner
:
clouds
are
now
coming
up
,
and
she
will
not
suffer
from
the
*NL*
heat
as
she
would
have
done
then
.
I
wish
_
you
_
may
not
be
fatigued
by
so
*NL*
much
exercise
.
I
wish
you
had
saved
yourself
this
walk
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
part
of
it
fatigues
me
but
getting
off
this
horse
,
I
assure
you
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
as
she
sprang
down
with
his
help
;
``
I
am
very
strong
.
Nothing
*NL*
ever
fatigues
me
but
doing
what
I
do
not
like
.
Miss
Price
,
I
give
way
to
*NL*
you
with
a
very
bad
grace
;
but
I
sincerely
hope
you
will
have
a
pleasant
*NL*
ride
,
and
that
I
may
have
nothing
but
good
to
hear
of
this
dear
,
*NL*
delightful
,
beautiful
animal
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
old
coachman
,
who
had
been
waiting
about
with
his
own
horse
,
now
*NL*
joining
them
,
Fanny
was
lifted
on
hers
,
and
they
set
off
across
another
*NL*
part
of
the
park
;
her
feelings
of
discomfort
not
lightened
by
seeing
,
as
*NL*
she
looked
back
,
that
the
others
were
walking
down
the
hill
together
to
*NL*
the
village
;
nor
did
her
attendant
do
her
much
good
by
his
comments
on
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
great
cleverness
as
a
horse-woman
,
which
he
had
been
*NL*
watching
with
an
interest
almost
equal
to
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pleasure
to
see
a
lady
with
such
a
good
heart
for
riding
!
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
I
never
see
one
sit
a
horse
better
.
She
did
not
seem
to
have
*NL*
a
thought
of
fear
.
Very
different
from
you
,
miss
,
when
you
first
began
,
*NL*
six
years
ago
come
next
Easter
.
Lord
bless
you
!
how
you
did
tremble
when
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
first
had
you
put
on
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing-room
Miss
Crawford
was
also
celebrated
.
Her
merit
in
*NL*
being
gifted
by
Nature
with
strength
and
courage
was
fully
appreciated
*NL*
by
the
Miss
Bertrams
;
her
delight
in
riding
was
like
their
own
;
her
*NL*
early
excellence
in
it
was
like
their
own
,
and
they
had
great
pleasure
*NL*
in
praising
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
sure
she
would
ride
well
,
''
said
Julia
;
``
she
has
the
make
for
it
.
*NL*
Her
figure
is
as
neat
as
her
brother
's
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
added
Maria
,
``
and
her
spirits
are
as
good
,
and
she
has
the
same
*NL*
energy
of
character
.
I
can
not
but
think
that
good
horsemanship
has
a
*NL*
great
deal
to
do
with
the
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
parted
at
night
Edmund
asked
Fanny
whether
she
meant
to
ride
*NL*
the
next
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
know
--
not
if
you
want
the
mare
,
''
was
her
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
want
her
at
all
for
myself
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
whenever
you
are
*NL*
next
inclined
to
stay
at
home
,
I
think
Miss
Crawford
would
be
glad
to
*NL*
have
her
a
longer
time
--
for
a
whole
morning
,
in
short
.
She
has
a
great
*NL*
desire
to
get
as
far
as
Mansfield
Common
:
Mrs.
Grant
has
been
telling
*NL*
her
of
its
fine
views
,
and
I
have
no
doubt
of
her
being
perfectly
equal
*NL*
to
it
.
But
any
morning
will
do
for
this
.
She
would
be
extremely
sorry
to
*NL*
interfere
with
you
.
It
would
be
very
wrong
if
she
did
.
_
She
_
rides
only
*NL*
for
pleasure
;
_
you
_
for
health
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
not
ride
to-morrow
,
certainly
,
''
said
Fanny
;
``
I
have
been
out
*NL*
very
often
lately
,
and
would
rather
stay
at
home
.
You
know
I
am
strong
*NL*
enough
now
to
walk
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
looked
pleased
,
which
must
be
Fanny
's
comfort
,
and
the
ride
to
*NL*
Mansfield
Common
took
place
the
next
morning
:
the
party
included
all
the
*NL*
young
people
but
herself
,
and
was
much
enjoyed
at
the
time
,
and
doubly
*NL*
enjoyed
again
in
the
evening
discussion
.
A
successful
scheme
of
this
*NL*
sort
generally
brings
on
another
;
and
the
having
been
to
Mansfield
*NL*
Common
disposed
them
all
for
going
somewhere
else
the
day
after
.
There
*NL*
were
many
other
views
to
be
shewn
;
and
though
the
weather
was
hot
,
there
*NL*
were
shady
lanes
wherever
they
wanted
to
go
.
A
young
party
is
always
*NL*
provided
with
a
shady
lane
.
Four
fine
mornings
successively
were
spent
*NL*
in
this
manner
,
in
shewing
the
Crawfords
the
country
,
and
doing
the
*NL*
honours
of
its
finest
spots
.
Everything
answered
;
it
was
all
gaiety
and
*NL*
good-humour
,
the
heat
only
supplying
inconvenience
enough
to
be
talked
*NL*
of
with
pleasure
--
till
the
fourth
day
,
when
the
happiness
of
one
of
*NL*
the
party
was
exceedingly
clouded
.
Miss
Bertram
was
the
one
.
Edmund
and
*NL*
Julia
were
invited
to
dine
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
_
she
_
was
excluded
.
*NL*
It
was
meant
and
done
by
Mrs.
Grant
,
with
perfect
good-humour
,
on
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
account
,
who
was
partly
expected
at
the
Park
that
day
;
*NL*
but
it
was
felt
as
a
very
grievous
injury
,
and
her
good
manners
were
*NL*
severely
taxed
to
conceal
her
vexation
and
anger
till
she
reached
home
.
*NL*
As
Mr.
Rushworth
did
_
not
_
come
,
the
injury
was
increased
,
and
she
had
*NL*
not
even
the
relief
of
shewing
her
power
over
him
;
she
could
only
be
*NL*
sullen
to
her
mother
,
aunt
,
and
cousin
,
and
throw
as
great
a
gloom
as
*NL*
possible
over
their
dinner
and
dessert
.
*NL*
*NL*
Between
ten
and
eleven
Edmund
and
Julia
walked
into
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
fresh
with
the
evening
air
,
glowing
and
cheerful
,
the
very
reverse
*NL*
of
what
they
found
in
the
three
ladies
sitting
there
,
for
Maria
would
*NL*
scarcely
raise
her
eyes
from
her
book
,
and
Lady
Bertram
was
half-asleep
;
*NL*
and
even
Mrs.
Norris
,
discomposed
by
her
niece
's
ill-humour
,
and
having
*NL*
asked
one
or
two
questions
about
the
dinner
,
which
were
not
immediately
*NL*
attended
to
,
seemed
almost
determined
to
say
no
more
.
For
a
few
minutes
*NL*
the
brother
and
sister
were
too
eager
in
their
praise
of
the
night
and
*NL*
their
remarks
on
the
stars
,
to
think
beyond
themselves
;
but
when
the
*NL*
first
pause
came
,
Edmund
,
looking
around
,
said
,
``
But
where
is
Fanny
?
Is
*NL*
she
gone
to
bed
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
not
that
I
know
of
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Norris
;
``
she
was
here
a
moment
*NL*
ago
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
own
gentle
voice
speaking
from
the
other
end
of
the
room
,
which
was
*NL*
a
very
long
one
,
told
them
that
she
was
on
the
sofa
.
Mrs.
Norris
began
*NL*
scolding
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
a
very
foolish
trick
,
Fanny
,
to
be
idling
away
all
the
evening
*NL*
upon
a
sofa
.
Why
can
not
you
come
and
sit
here
,
and
employ
yourself
as
*NL*
_
we
_
do
?
If
you
have
no
work
of
your
own
,
I
can
supply
you
from
the
*NL*
poor
basket
.
There
is
all
the
new
calico
,
that
was
bought
last
week
,
*NL*
not
touched
yet
.
I
am
sure
I
almost
broke
my
back
by
cutting
it
out
.
You
*NL*
should
learn
to
think
of
other
people
;
and
,
take
my
word
for
it
,
it
is
a
*NL*
shocking
trick
for
a
young
person
to
be
always
lolling
upon
a
sofa
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Before
half
this
was
said
,
Fanny
was
returned
to
her
seat
at
the
table
,
*NL*
and
had
taken
up
her
work
again
;
and
Julia
,
who
was
in
high
good-humour
,
*NL*
from
the
pleasures
of
the
day
,
did
her
the
justice
of
exclaiming
,
``
I
*NL*
must
say
,
ma'am
,
that
Fanny
is
as
little
upon
the
sofa
as
anybody
in
the
*NL*
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
,
''
said
Edmund
,
after
looking
at
her
attentively
,
``
I
am
sure
you
*NL*
have
the
headache
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
deny
it
,
but
said
it
was
not
very
bad
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
hardly
believe
you
,
''
he
replied
;
``
I
know
your
looks
too
well
.
How
*NL*
long
have
you
had
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Since
a
little
before
dinner
.
It
is
nothing
but
the
heat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
go
out
in
the
heat
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
out
!
to
be
sure
she
did
,
''
said
Mrs.
Norris
:
``
would
you
have
her
stay
*NL*
within
such
a
fine
day
as
this
?
Were
not
we
_
all
_
out
?
Even
your
mother
*NL*
was
out
to-day
for
above
an
hour
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
Edmund
,
''
added
her
ladyship
,
who
had
been
thoroughly
*NL*
awakened
by
Mrs.
Norris
's
sharp
reprimand
to
Fanny
;
``
I
was
out
above
an
*NL*
hour
.
I
sat
three-quarters
of
an
hour
in
the
flower-garden
,
while
Fanny
*NL*
cut
the
roses
;
and
very
pleasant
it
was
,
I
assure
you
,
but
very
hot
.
It
*NL*
was
shady
enough
in
the
alcove
,
but
I
declare
I
quite
dreaded
the
coming
*NL*
home
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
has
been
cutting
roses
,
has
she
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
and
I
am
afraid
they
will
be
the
last
this
year
.
Poor
thing
!
_
She
_
*NL*
found
it
hot
enough
;
but
they
were
so
full-blown
that
one
could
not
*NL*
wait
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
was
no
help
for
it
,
certainly
,
''
rejoined
Mrs.
Norris
,
in
a
rather
*NL*
softened
voice
;
``
but
I
question
whether
her
headache
might
not
be
caught
*NL*
_
then
_
,
sister
.
There
is
nothing
so
likely
to
give
it
as
standing
and
*NL*
stooping
in
a
hot
sun
;
but
I
dare
say
it
will
be
well
to-morrow
.
Suppose
*NL*
you
let
her
have
your
aromatic
vinegar
;
I
always
forget
to
have
mine
*NL*
filled
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
has
got
it
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
;
``
she
has
had
it
ever
since
she
came
*NL*
back
from
your
house
the
second
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Edmund
;
``
has
she

walking
as
well
as
cutting
roses
;
*NL*
walking
across
the
hot
park
to
your
house
,
and
doing
it
twice
,
ma'am
?
No
*NL*
wonder
her
head
aches
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
was
talking
to
Julia
,
and
did
not
hear
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
afraid
it
would
be
too
much
for
her
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
;
``
but
*NL*
when
the
roses
were
gathered
,
your
aunt
wished
to
have
them
,
and
then
*NL*
you
know
they
must
be
taken
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
were
there
roses
enough
to
oblige
her
to
go
twice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
but
they
were
to
be
put
into
the
spare
room
to
dry
;
and
,
unluckily
,
*NL*
Fanny
forgot
to
lock
the
door
of
the
room
and
bring
away
the
key
,
so
she
*NL*
was
obliged
to
go
again

*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
got
up
and
walked
about
the
room
,
saying
,
``
And
could
nobody
be
*NL*
employed
on
such
an
errand
but
Fanny
?
Upon
my
word
,
ma'am
,
it
has
been
a
*NL*
very
ill-managed
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
I
do
not
know
how
it
was
to
have
been
done
better
,
''
cried
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
unable
to
be
longer
deaf
;
``
unless
I
had
gone
myself
,
*NL*
indeed
;
but
I
can
not
be
in
two
places
at
once
;
and
I
was
talking
to
Mr.
*NL*
Green
at
that
very
time
about
your
mother
's
dairymaid
,
by
_
her
_
desire
,
*NL*
and
had
promised
John
Groom
to
write
to
Mrs.
Jefferies
about
his
son
,
*NL*
and
the
poor
fellow
was
waiting
for
me
half
an
hour
.
I
think
nobody
*NL*
can
justly
accuse
me
of
sparing
myself
upon
any
occasion
,
but
really
I
*NL*
can
not
do
everything
at
once
.
And
as
for
Fanny
's
just
stepping
down
*NL*
to
my
house
for
me
--
it
is
not
much
above
a
quarter
of
a
mile
--
I
can
not
*NL*
think
I
was
unreasonable
to
ask
it
.
How
often
do
I
pace
it
three
times
a
*NL*
day
,
early
and
late
,
ay
,
and
in
all
weathers
too
,
and
say
nothing
about
*NL*
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
Fanny
had
half
your
strength
,
ma'am
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Fanny
would
be
more
regular
in
her
exercise
,
she
would
not
be
*NL*
knocked
up
so
soon
.
She
has
not
been
out
on
horseback
now
this
long
*NL*
while
,
and
I
am
persuaded
that
,
when
she
does
not
ride
,
she
ought
to
*NL*
walk
.
If
she
had
been
riding
before
,
I
should
not
have
asked
it
of
her
.
*NL*
But
I
thought
it
would
rather
do
her
good
after
being
stooping
among
the
*NL*
roses
;
for
there
is
nothing
so
refreshing
as
a
walk
after
a
fatigue
*NL*
of
that
kind
;
and
though
the
sun
was
strong
,
it
was
not
so
very
hot
.
*NL*
Between
ourselves
,
Edmund
,
''
nodding
significantly
at
his
mother
,
``
it
was
*NL*
cutting
the
roses
,
and
dawdling
about
in
the
flower-garden
,
that
did
the
*NL*
mischief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
it
was
,
indeed
,
''
said
the
more
candid
Lady
Bertram
,
who
had
*NL*
overheard
her
;
``
I
am
very
much
afraid
she
caught
the
headache
there
,
*NL*
for
the
heat
was
enough
to
kill
anybody
.
It
was
as
much
as
I
could
bear
*NL*
myself
.
Sitting
and
calling
to
Pug
,
and
trying
to
keep
him
from
the
*NL*
flower-beds
,
was
almost
too
much
for
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
said
no
more
to
either
lady
;
but
going
quietly
to
another
table
,
*NL*
on
which
the
supper-tray
yet
remained
,
brought
a
glass
of
Madeira
to
*NL*
Fanny
,
and
obliged
her
to
drink
the
greater
part
.
She
wished
to
be
able
*NL*
to
decline
it
;
but
the
tears
,
which
a
variety
of
feelings
created
,
made
*NL*
it
easier
to
swallow
than
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
Vexed
as
Edmund
was
with
his
mother
and
aunt
,
he
was
still
more
angry
*NL*
with
himself
.
His
own
forgetfulness
of
her
was
worse
than
anything
which
*NL*
they
had
done
.
Nothing
of
this
would
have
happened
had
she
been
properly
*NL*
considered
;
but
she
had
been
left
four
days
together
without
any
choice
*NL*
of
companions
or
exercise
,
and
without
any
excuse
for
avoiding
whatever
*NL*
her
unreasonable
aunts
might
require
.
He
was
ashamed
to
think
that
*NL*
for
four
days
together
she
had
not
had
the
power
of
riding
,
and
very
*NL*
seriously
resolved
,
however
unwilling
he
must
be
to
check
a
pleasure
of
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
,
that
it
should
never
happen
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
went
to
bed
with
her
heart
as
full
as
on
the
first
evening
of
her
*NL*
arrival
at
the
Park
.
The
state
of
her
spirits
had
probably
had
its
*NL*
share
in
her
indisposition
;
for
she
had
been
feeling
neglected
,
and
been
*NL*
struggling
against
discontent
and
envy
for
some
days
past
.
As
she
leant
*NL*
on
the
sofa
,
to
which
she
had
retreated
that
she
might
not
be
seen
,
the
*NL*
pain
of
her
mind
had
been
much
beyond
that
in
her
head
;
and
the
sudden
*NL*
change
which
Edmund
's
kindness
had
then
occasioned
,
made
her
hardly
know
*NL*
how
to
support
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
VIII
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
rides
recommenced
the
very
next
day
;
and
as
it
was
a
pleasant
*NL*
fresh-feeling
morning
,
less
hot
than
the
weather
had
lately
been
,
Edmund
*NL*
trusted
that
her
losses
,
both
of
health
and
pleasure
,
would
be
soon
made
*NL*
good
.
While
she
was
gone
Mr.
Rushworth
arrived
,
escorting
his
mother
,
*NL*
who
came
to
be
civil
and
to
shew
her
civility
especially
,
in
urging
the
*NL*
execution
of
the
plan
for
visiting
Sotherton
,
which
had
been
started
a
*NL*
fortnight
before
,
and
which
,
in
consequence
of
her
subsequent
absence
*NL*
from
home
,
had
since
lain
dormant
.
Mrs.
Norris
and
her
nieces
were
all
*NL*
well
pleased
with
its
revival
,
and
an
early
day
was
named
and
agreed
*NL*
to
,
provided
Mr.
Crawford
should
be
disengaged
:
the
young
ladies
did
*NL*
not
forget
that
stipulation
,
and
though
Mrs.
Norris
would
willingly
have
*NL*
answered
for
his
being
so
,
they
would
neither
authorise
the
liberty
nor
*NL*
run
the
risk
;
and
at
last
,
on
a
hint
from
Miss
Bertram
,
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
discovered
that
the
properest
thing
to
be
done
was
for
him
to
walk
down
*NL*
to
the
Parsonage
directly
,
and
call
on
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
inquire
whether
*NL*
Wednesday
would
suit
him
or
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
his
return
Mrs.
Grant
and
Miss
Crawford
came
in
.
Having
been
out
*NL*
some
time
,
and
taken
a
different
route
to
the
house
,
they
had
not
met
*NL*
him
.
Comfortable
hopes
,
however
,
were
given
that
he
would
find
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
at
home
.
The
Sotherton
scheme
was
mentioned
of
course
.
It
was
*NL*
hardly
possible
,
indeed
,
that
anything
else
should
be
talked
of
,
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Norris
was
in
high
spirits
about
it
;
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
a
*NL*
well-meaning
,
civil
,
prosing
,
pompous
woman
,
who
thought
nothing
of
*NL*
consequence
,
but
as
it
related
to
her
own
and
her
son
's
concerns
,
*NL*
had
not
yet
given
over
pressing
Lady
Bertram
to
be
of
the
party
.
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
constantly
declined
it
;
but
her
placid
manner
of
refusal
made
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
still
think
she
wished
to
come
,
till
Mrs.
Norris
's
more
*NL*
numerous
words
and
louder
tone
convinced
her
of
the
truth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
my
sister
,
a
great
deal
too
much
,
I
*NL*
assure
you
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
.
Ten
miles
there
,
and
ten
back
,
you
*NL*
know
.
You
must
excuse
my
sister
on
this
occasion
,
and
accept
of
our
*NL*
two
dear
girls
and
myself
without
her
.
Sotherton
is
the
only
place
that
*NL*
could
give
her
a
_
wish
_
to
go
so
far
,
but
it
can
not
be
,
indeed
.
She
will
*NL*
have
a
companion
in
Fanny
Price
,
you
know
,
so
it
will
all
do
very
well
;
*NL*
and
as
for
Edmund
,
as
he
is
not
here
to
speak
for
himself
,
I
will
answer
*NL*
for
his
being
most
happy
to
join
the
party
.
He
can
go
on
horseback
,
you
*NL*
know

''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
being
obliged
to
yield
to
Lady
Bertram
's
staying
at
home
,
*NL*
could
only
be
sorry
.
``
The
loss
of
her
ladyship
's
company
would
be
a
*NL*
great
drawback
,
and
she
should
have
been
extremely
happy
to
have
seen
*NL*
the
young
lady
too
,
Miss
Price
,
who
had
never
been
at
Sotherton
yet
,
and
*NL*
it
was
a
pity
she
should
not
see
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
very
kind
,
you
are
all
kindness
,
my
dear
madam
,
''
cried
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
;
``
but
as
to
Fanny
,
she
will
have
opportunities
in
plenty
of
*NL*
seeing
Sotherton
.
She
has
time
enough
before
her
;
and
her
going
now
is
*NL*
quite
out
of
the
question
.
Lady
Bertram
could
not
possibly
spare
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
I
can
not
do
without
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
proceeded
next
,
under
the
conviction
that
everybody
must
*NL*
be
wanting
to
see
Sotherton
,
to
include
Miss
Crawford
in
the
invitation
;
*NL*
and
though
Mrs.
Grant
,
who
had
not
been
at
the
trouble
of
visiting
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
,
on
her
coming
into
the
neighbourhood
,
civilly
declined
it
on
*NL*
her
own
account
,
she
was
glad
to
secure
any
pleasure
for
her
sister
;
*NL*
and
Mary
,
properly
pressed
and
persuaded
,
was
not
long
in
accepting
*NL*
her
share
of
the
civility
.
Mr.
Rushworth
came
back
from
the
Parsonage
*NL*
successful
;
and
Edmund
made
his
appearance
just
in
time
to
learn
*NL*
what
had
been
settled
for
Wednesday
,
to
attend
Mrs.
Rushworth
to
her
*NL*
carriage
,
and
walk
half-way
down
the
park
with
the
two
other
ladies
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
his
return
to
the
breakfast-room
,
he
found
Mrs.
Norris
trying
to
*NL*
make
up
her
mind
as
to
whether
Miss
Crawford
's
being
of
the
party
were
*NL*
desirable
or
not
,
or
whether
her
brother
's
barouche
would
not
be
full
*NL*
without
her
.
The
Miss
Bertrams
laughed
at
the
idea
,
assuring
her
that
*NL*
the
barouche
would
hold
four
perfectly
well
,
independent
of
the
box
,
on
*NL*
which
_
one
_
might
go
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
is
it
necessary
,
''
said
Edmund
,
``
that
Crawford
's
carriage
,
or
*NL*
his
_
only
_
,
should
be
employed
?
Why
is
no
use
to
be
made
of
my
mother
's
*NL*
chaise
?
I
could
not
,
when
the
scheme
was
first
mentioned
the
other
*NL*
day
,
understand
why
a
visit
from
the
family
were
not
to
be
made
in
the
*NL*
carriage
of
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
''
cried
Julia
:
``
go
boxed
up
three
in
a
postchaise
in
this
weather

have
seats

No

Edmund

will
not

quite
do

``
Besides

said
Maria
,
``
I
know
that

After

added
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
taking

not

fond

always

bitterly

narrow

scratched
off

handsome
reason

the
truth

*NL*
``
Unpleasant

Maria

great
*NL*
desire
to
see
Sotherton
.
I
know
she
wishes
it
very
much
.
She
has
not
*NL*
often
a
gratification
of
the
kind
,
and
I
am
sure
,
ma'am
,
you
would
be
*NL*
glad
to
give
her
the
pleasure
now
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
very
glad
,
if
your
aunt
sees
no
objection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
was
very
ready
with
the
only
objection
which
could
*NL*
remain
--
their
having
positively
assured
Mrs.
Rushworth
that
Fanny
could
*NL*
not
go
,
and
the
very
strange
appearance
there
would
consequently
be
in
*NL*
taking
her
,
which
seemed
to
her
a
difficulty
quite
impossible
to
be
got
*NL*
over
.
It
must
have
the
strangest
appearance
!
It
would
be
something
so
*NL*
very
unceremonious
,
so
bordering
on
disrespect
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
whose
*NL*
own
manners
were
such
a
pattern
of
good-breeding
and
attention
,
that
she
*NL*
really
did
not
feel
equal
to
it
.
Mrs.
Norris
had
no
affection
for
Fanny
,
*NL*
and
no
wish
of
procuring
her
pleasure
at
any
time
;
but
her
opposition
to
*NL*
Edmund
_
now
_
,
arose
more
from
partiality
for
her
own
scheme
,
because
it
*NL*
_
was
_
her
own
,
than
from
anything
else
.
She
felt
that
she
had
arranged
*NL*
everything
extremely
well
,
and
that
any
alteration
must
be
for
the
*NL*
worse
.
When
Edmund
,
therefore
,
told
her
in
reply
,
as
he
did
when
she
*NL*
would
give
him
the
hearing
,
that
she
need
not
distress
herself
on
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
account
,
because
he
had
taken
the
opportunity
,
as
he
walked
*NL*
with
her
through
the
hall
,
of
mentioning
Miss
Price
as
one
who
would
*NL*
probably
be
of
the
party
,
and
had
directly
received
a
very
sufficient
*NL*
invitation
for
his
cousin
,
Mrs.
Norris
was
too
much
vexed
to
submit
with
*NL*
a
very
good
grace
,
and
would
only
say
,
``
Very
well
,
very
well
,
just
as
*NL*
you
chuse
,
settle
it
your
own
way
,
I
am
sure
I
do
not
care
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
seems
very
odd
,
''
said
Maria
,
``
that
you
should
be
staying
at
home
*NL*
instead
of
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sure
she
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
''
added
Julia
,
*NL*
hastily
leaving
the
room
as
she
spoke
,
from
a
consciousness
that
she
*NL*
ought
to
offer
to
stay
at
home
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
will
feel
quite
as
grateful
as
the
occasion
requires
,
''
was
*NL*
Edmund
's
only
reply
,
and
the
subject
dropt
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
gratitude
,
when
she
heard
the
plan
,
was
,
in
fact
,
much
greater
*NL*
than
her
pleasure
.
She
felt
Edmund
's
kindness
with
all
,
and
more
than
*NL*
all
,
the
sensibility
which
he
,
unsuspicious
of
her
fond
attachment
,
*NL*
could
be
aware
of
;
but
that
he
should
forego
any
enjoyment
on
her
*NL*
account
gave
her
pain
,
and
her
own
satisfaction
in
seeing
Sotherton
*NL*
would
be
nothing
without
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
meeting
of
the
two
Mansfield
families
produced
another
*NL*
alteration
in
the
plan
,
and
one
that
was
admitted
with
general
*NL*
approbation
.
Mrs.
Grant
offered
herself
as
companion
for
the
day
to
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
in
lieu
of
her
son
,
and
Dr.
Grant
was
to
join
them
at
dinner
.
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
was
very
well
pleased
to
have
it
so
,
and
the
young
ladies
*NL*
were
in
spirits
again
.
Even
Edmund
was
very
thankful
for
an
arrangement
*NL*
which
restored
him
to
his
share
of
the
party
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
thought
it
*NL*
an
excellent
plan
,
and
had
it
at
her
tongue
's
end
,
and
was
on
the
point
*NL*
of
proposing
it
,
when
Mrs.
Grant
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Wednesday
was
fine
,
and
soon
after
breakfast
the
barouche
arrived
,
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
driving
his
sisters
;
and
as
everybody
was
ready
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
to
be
done
but
for
Mrs.
Grant
to
alight
and
the
others
to
take
*NL*
their
places
.
The
place
of
all
places
,
the
envied
seat
,
the
post
of
*NL*
honour
,
was
unappropriated
.
To
whose
happy
lot
was
it
to
fall
?
While
*NL*
each
of
the
Miss
Bertrams
were
meditating
how
best
,
and
with
the
most
*NL*
appearance
of
obliging
the
others
,
to
secure
it
,
the
matter
was
settled
*NL*
by
Mrs.
Grant
's
saying
,
as
she
stepped
from
the
carriage
,
``
As
there
are
*NL*
five
of
you
,
it
will
be
better
that
one
should
sit
with
Henry
;
and
as
*NL*
you
were
saying
lately
that
you
wished
you
could
drive
,
Julia
,
I
think
*NL*
this
will
be
a
good
opportunity
for
you
to
take
a
lesson
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Happy
Julia
!
Unhappy
Maria
!
The
former
was
on
the
barouche-box
in
a
*NL*
moment
,
the
latter
took
her
seat
within
,
in
gloom
and
mortification
;
and
*NL*
the
carriage
drove
off
amid
the
good
wishes
of
the
two
remaining
ladies
,
*NL*
and
the
barking
of
Pug
in
his
mistress
's
arms
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
road
was
through
a
pleasant
country
;
and
Fanny
,
whose
rides
had
*NL*
never
been
extensive
,
was
soon
beyond
her
knowledge
,
and
was
very
happy
*NL*
in
observing
all
that
was
new
,
and
admiring
all
that
was
pretty
.
She
was
*NL*
not
often
invited
to
join
in
the
conversation
of
the
others
,
nor
did
*NL*
she
desire
it
.
Her
own
thoughts
and
reflections
were
habitually
her
*NL*
best
companions
;
and
,
in
observing
the
appearance
of
the
country
,
the
*NL*
bearings
of
the
roads
,
the
difference
of
soil
,
the
state
of
the
harvest
,
*NL*
the
cottages
,
the
cattle
,
the
children
,
she
found
entertainment
that
*NL*
could
only
have
been
heightened
by
having
Edmund
to
speak
to
of
what
she
*NL*
felt
.
That
was
the
only
point
of
resemblance
between
her
and
the
lady
*NL*
who
sat
by
her
:
in
everything
but
a
value
for
Edmund
,
Miss
Crawford
was
*NL*
very
unlike
her
.
She
had
none
of
Fanny
's
delicacy
of
taste
,
of
mind
,
of
*NL*
feeling
;
she
saw
Nature
,
inanimate
Nature
,
with
little
observation
;
*NL*
her
attention
was
all
for
men
and
women
,
her
talents
for
the
light
*NL*
and
lively
.
In
looking
back
after
Edmund
,
however
,
when
there
was
any
*NL*
stretch
of
road
behind
them
,
or
when
he
gained
on
them
in
ascending
a
*NL*
considerable
hill
,
they
were
united
,
and
a
``
there
he
is
''
broke
at
the
*NL*
same
moment
from
them
both
,
more
than
once
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
first
seven
miles
Miss
Bertram
had
very
little
real
comfort
:
*NL*
her
prospect
always
ended
in
Mr.
Crawford
and
her
sister
sitting
side
by
*NL*
side
,
full
of
conversation
and
merriment
;
and
to
see
only
his
expressive
*NL*
profile
as
he
turned
with
a
smile
to
Julia
,
or
to
catch
the
laugh
of
*NL*
the
other
,
was
a
perpetual
source
of
irritation
,
which
her
own
sense
*NL*
of
propriety
could
but
just
smooth
over
.
When
Julia
looked
back
,
it
was
*NL*
with
a
countenance
of
delight
,
and
whenever
she
spoke
to
them
,
it
was
in
*NL*
the
highest
spirits
:
``
her
view
of
the
country
was
charming
,
she
wished
*NL*
they
could
all
see
it
,
''
etc.
;
but
her
only
offer
of
exchange
was
*NL*
addressed
to
Miss
Crawford
,
as
they
gained
the
summit
of
a
long
hill
,
*NL*
and
was
not
more
inviting
than
this
:
``
Here
is
a
fine
burst
of
country
.
I
*NL*
wish
you
had
my
seat
,
but
I
dare
say
you
will
not
take
it
,
let
me
press
*NL*
you
ever
so
much
;
''
and
Miss
Crawford
could
hardly
answer
before
they
*NL*
were
moving
again
at
a
good
pace
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
they
came
within
the
influence
of
Sotherton
associations
,
it
was
*NL*
better
for
Miss
Bertram
,
who
might
be
said
to
have
two
strings
to
her
*NL*
bow
.
She
had
Rushworth
feelings
,
and
Crawford
feelings
,
and
in
*NL*
the
vicinity
of
Sotherton
the
former
had
considerable
effect
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
consequence
was
hers
.
She
could
not
tell
Miss
Crawford
that
*NL*
``
those
woods
belonged
to
Sotherton
,
''
she
could
not
carelessly
observe
*NL*
that
``
she
believed
that
it
was
now
all
Mr.
Rushworth
's
property
on
each
*NL*
side
of
the
road
,
''
without
elation
of
heart
;
and
it
was
a
pleasure
*NL*
to
increase
with
their
approach
to
the
capital
freehold
mansion
,
*NL*
and
ancient
manorial
residence
of
the
family
,
with
all
its
rights
of
*NL*
court-leet
and
court-baron
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
we
shall
have
no
more
rough
road
,
Miss
Crawford
;
our
difficulties
*NL*
are
over
.
The
rest
of
the
way
is
such
as
it
ought
to
be
.
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
has
made
it
since
he
succeeded
to
the
estate
.
Here
begins
the
village
.
*NL*
Those
cottages
are
really
a
disgrace
.
The
church
spire
is
reckoned
*NL*
remarkably
handsome
.
I
am
glad
the
church
is
not
so
close
to
the
great
*NL*
house
as
often
happens
in
old
places
.
The
annoyance
of
the
bells
must
be
*NL*
terrible
.
There
is
the
parsonage
:
a
tidy-looking
house
,
and
I
understand
*NL*
the
clergyman
and
his
wife
are
very
decent
people
.
Those
are
almshouses
,
*NL*
built
by
some
of
the
family
.
To
the
right
is
the
steward
's
house
;
he
*NL*
is
a
very
respectable
man
.
Now
we
are
coming
to
the
lodge-gates
;
but
we
*NL*
have
nearly
a
mile
through
the
park
still
.
It
is
not
ugly
,
you
see
,
at
*NL*
this
end
;
there
is
some
fine
timber
,
but
the
situation
of
the
house
is
*NL*
dreadful
.
We
go
down
hill
to
it
for
half
a
mile
,
and
it
is
a
pity
,
for
*NL*
it
would
not
be
an
ill-looking
place
if
it
had
a
better
approach
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
was
not
slow
to
admire
;
she
pretty
well
guessed
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
's
feelings
,
and
made
it
a
point
of
honour
to
promote
her
*NL*
enjoyment
to
the
utmost
.
Mrs.
Norris
was
all
delight
and
volubility
;
and
*NL*
even
Fanny
had
something
to
say
in
admiration
,
and
might
be
heard
with
*NL*
complacency
.
Her
eye
was
eagerly
taking
in
everything
within
her
reach
;
*NL*
and
after
being
at
some
pains
to
get
a
view
of
the
house
,
and
observing
*NL*
that
``
it
was
a
sort
of
building
which
she
could
not
look
at
but
with
*NL*
respect
,
''
she
added
,
``
Now
,
where
is
the
avenue
?
The
house
fronts
the
*NL*
east
,
I
perceive
.
The
avenue
,
therefore
,
must
be
at
the
back
of
it
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
talked
of
the
west
front
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
is
exactly
behind
the
house
;
begins
at
a
little
distance
,
and
*NL*
ascends
for
half
a
mile
to
the
extremity
of
the
grounds
.
You
may
see
*NL*
something
of
it
here
--
something
of
the
more
distant
trees
.
It
is
oak
*NL*
entirely
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bertram
could
now
speak
with
decided
information
of
what
she
had
*NL*
known
nothing
about
when
Mr.
Rushworth
had
asked
her
opinion
;
and
her
*NL*
spirits
were
in
as
happy
a
flutter
as
vanity
and
pride
could
furnish
,
*NL*
when
they
drove
up
to
the
spacious
stone
steps
before
the
principal
*NL*
entrance
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
IX
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
was
at
the
door
to
receive
his
fair
lady
;
and
the
whole
*NL*
party
were
welcomed
by
him
with
due
attention
.
In
the
drawing-room
they
*NL*
were
met
with
equal
cordiality
by
the
mother
,
and
Miss
Bertram
had
all
*NL*
the
distinction
with
each
that
she
could
wish
.
After
the
business
of
*NL*
arriving
was
over
,
it
was
first
necessary
to
eat
,
and
the
doors
were
*NL*
thrown
open
to
admit
them
through
one
or
two
intermediate
rooms
into
the
*NL*
appointed
dining-parlour
,
where
a
collation
was
prepared
with
abundance
*NL*
and
elegance
.
Much
was
said
,
and
much
was
ate
,
and
all
went
well
.
The
*NL*
particular
object
of
the
day
was
then
considered
.
How
would
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
like
,
in
what
manner
would
he
chuse
,
to
take
a
survey
of
the
grounds
?
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
mentioned
his
curricle
.
Mr.
Crawford
suggested
the
greater
*NL*
desirableness
of
some
carriage
which
might
convey
more
than
two
.
``
To
be
*NL*
depriving
themselves
of
the
advantage
of
other
eyes
and
other
judgments
,
*NL*
might
be
an
evil
even
beyond
the
loss
of
present
pleasure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
proposed
that
the
chaise
should
be
taken
also
;
but
this
*NL*
was
scarcely
received
as
an
amendment
:
the
young
ladies
neither
smiled
*NL*
nor
spoke
.
Her
next
proposition
,
of
shewing
the
house
to
such
of
them
*NL*
as
had
not
been
there
before
,
was
more
acceptable
,
for
Miss
Bertram
*NL*
was
pleased
to
have
its
size
displayed
,
and
all
were
glad
to
be
doing
*NL*
something
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
whole
party
rose
accordingly
,
and
under
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
guidance
*NL*
were
shewn
through
a
number
of
rooms
,
all
lofty
,
and
many
large
,
and
*NL*
amply
furnished
in
the
taste
of
fifty
years
back
,
with
shining
floors
,
*NL*
solid
mahogany
,
rich
damask
,
marble
,
gilding
,
and
carving
,
each
handsome
*NL*
in
its
way
.
Of
pictures
there
were
abundance
,
and
some
few
good
,
but
*NL*
the
larger
part
were
family
portraits
,
no
longer
anything
to
anybody
*NL*
but
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
who
had
been
at
great
pains
to
learn
all
that
the
*NL*
housekeeper
could
teach
,
and
was
now
almost
equally
well
qualified
to
*NL*
shew
the
house
.
On
the
present
occasion
she
addressed
herself
chiefly
to
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
and
Fanny
,
but
there
was
no
comparison
in
the
willingness
*NL*
of
their
attention
;
for
Miss
Crawford
,
who
had
seen
scores
of
great
*NL*
houses
,
and
cared
for
none
of
them
,
had
only
the
appearance
of
civilly
*NL*
listening
,
while
Fanny
,
to
whom
everything
was
almost
as
interesting
*NL*
as
it
was
new
,
attended
with
unaffected
earnestness
to
all
that
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
could
relate
of
the
family
in
former
times
,
its
rise
and
*NL*
grandeur
,
regal
visits
and
loyal
efforts
,
delighted
to
connect
anything
*NL*
with
history
already
known
,
or
warm
her
imagination
with
scenes
of
the
*NL*
past
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
situation
of
the
house
excluded
the
possibility
of
much
prospect
*NL*
from
any
of
the
rooms
;
and
while
Fanny
and
some
of
the
others
were
*NL*
attending
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
Henry
Crawford
was
looking
grave
and
shaking
*NL*
his
head
at
the
windows
.
Every
room
on
the
west
front
looked
across
*NL*
a
lawn
to
the
beginning
of
the
avenue
immediately
beyond
tall
iron
*NL*
palisades
and
gates
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
visited
many
more
rooms
than
could
be
supposed
to
be
of
any
*NL*
other
use
than
to
contribute
to
the
window-tax
,
and
find
employment
for
*NL*
housemaids
,
``
Now
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
``
we
are
coming
to
the
chapel
,
*NL*
which
properly
we
ought
to
enter
from
above
,
and
look
down
upon
;
but
*NL*
as
we
are
quite
among
friends
,
I
will
take
you
in
this
way
,
if
you
will
*NL*
excuse
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
entered
.
Fanny
's
imagination
had
prepared
her
for
something
*NL*
grander
than
a
mere
spacious
,
oblong
room
,
fitted
up
for
the
purpose
of
*NL*
devotion
:
with
nothing
more
striking
or
more
solemn
than
the
profusion
*NL*
of
mahogany
,
and
the
crimson
velvet
cushions
appearing
over
the
ledge
of
*NL*
the
family
gallery
above
.
``
I
am
disappointed
,
''
said
she
,
in
a
low
voice
,
*NL*
to
Edmund
.
``
This
is
not
my
idea
of
a
chapel
.
There
is
nothing
awful
*NL*
here
,
nothing
melancholy
,
nothing
grand
.
Here
are
no
aisles
,
no
arches
,
*NL*
no
inscriptions
,
no
banners
.
No
banners
,
cousin
,
to
be
`
blown
by
the
*NL*
night
wind
of
heaven
.
'
No
signs
that
a
`
Scottish
monarch
sleeps
below
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
forget
,
Fanny
,
how
lately
all
this
has
been
built
,
and
for
how
*NL*
confined
a
purpose
,
compared
with
the
old
chapels
of
castles
and
*NL*
monasteries
.
It
was
only
for
the
private
use
of
the
family
.
They
have
*NL*
been
buried
,
I
suppose
,
in
the
parish
church
.
_
There
_
you
must
look
for
*NL*
the
banners
and
the
achievements
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
foolish
of
me
not
to
think
of
all
that
;
but
I
am
disappointed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
began
her
relation
.
``
This
chapel
was
fitted
up
as
you
see
*NL*
it
,
in
James
the
Second
's
time
.
Before
that
period
,
as
I
understand
,
*NL*
the
pews
were
only
wainscot
;
and
there
is
some
reason
to
think
that
*NL*
the
linings
and
cushions
of
the
pulpit
and
family
seat
were
only
purple
*NL*
cloth
;
but
this
is
not
quite
certain
.
It
is
a
handsome
chapel
,
and
was
*NL*
formerly
in
constant
use
both
morning
and
evening
.
Prayers
were
always
*NL*
read
in
it
by
the
domestic
chaplain
,
within
the
memory
of
many
;
but
the
*NL*
late
Mr.
Rushworth
left
it
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Every
generation
has
its
improvements
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
with
a
*NL*
smile
,
to
Edmund
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
was
gone
to
repeat
her
lesson
to
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
*NL*
Edmund
,
Fanny
,
and
Miss
Crawford
remained
in
a
cluster
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
``
that
the
custom
should
have
been
*NL*
discontinued
.
It
was
a
valuable
part
of
former
times
.
There
is
something
*NL*
in
a
chapel
and
chaplain
so
much
in
character
with
a
great
house
,
*NL*
with
one
's
ideas
of
what
such
a
household
should
be
!
A
whole
family
*NL*
assembling
regularly
for
the
purpose
of
prayer
is
fine
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
fine
indeed
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
laughing
.
``
It
must
do
the
heads
*NL*
of
the
family
a
great
deal
of
good
to
force
all
the
poor
housemaids
and
*NL*
footmen
to
leave
business
and
pleasure
,
and
say
their
prayers
here
twice
*NL*
a
day
,
while
they
are
inventing
excuses
themselves
for
staying
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
_
is
hardly
Fanny
's
idea
of
a
family
assembling
,
''
said
Edmund
.
``
If
*NL*
the
master
and
mistress
do
_
not
_
attend
themselves
,
there
must
be
more
*NL*
harm
than
good
in
the
custom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
At
any
rate
,
it
is
safer
to
leave
people
to
their
own
devices
on
such
*NL*
subjects
.
Everybody
likes
to
go
their
own
way
--
to
chuse
their
own
time
*NL*
and
manner
of
devotion
.
The
obligation
of
attendance
,
the
formality
,
the
*NL*
restraint
,
the
length
of
time
--
altogether
it
is
a
formidable
thing
,
and
*NL*
what
nobody
likes
;
and
if
the
good
people
who
used
to
kneel
and
gape
in
*NL*
that
gallery
could
have
foreseen
that
the
time
would
ever
come
when
men
*NL*
and
women
might
lie
another
ten
minutes
in
bed
,
when
they
woke
with
a
*NL*
headache
,
without
danger
of
reprobation
,
because
chapel
was
missed
,
*NL*
they
would
have
jumped
with
joy
and
envy
.
Can
not
you
imagine
with
what
*NL*
unwilling
feelings
the
former
belles
of
the
house
of
Rushworth
did
*NL*
many
a
time
repair
to
this
chapel
?
The
young
Mrs.
Eleanors
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Bridgets
--
starched
up
into
seeming
piety
,
but
with
heads
full
of
*NL*
something
very
different
--
especially
if
the
poor
chaplain
were
not
worth
*NL*
looking
at
--
and
,
in
those
days
,
I
fancy
parsons
were
very
inferior
even
*NL*
to
what
they
are
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
few
moments
she
was
unanswered
.
Fanny
coloured
and
looked
*NL*
at
Edmund
,
but
felt
too
angry
for
speech
;
and
he
needed
a
little
*NL*
recollection
before
he
could
say
,
``
Your
lively
mind
can
hardly
be
*NL*
serious
even
on
serious
subjects
.
You
have
given
us
an
amusing
sketch
,
*NL*
and
human
nature
can
not
say
it
was
not
so
.
We
must
all
feel
_
at
_
_
times
_
*NL*
the
difficulty
of
fixing
our
thoughts
as
we
could
wish
;
but
if
you
are
*NL*
supposing
it
a
frequent
thing
,
that
is
to
say
,
a
weakness
grown
into
a
*NL*
habit
from
neglect
,
what
could
be
expected
from
the
_
private
_
devotions
*NL*
of
such
persons
?
Do
you
think
the
minds
which
are
suffered
,
which
*NL*
are
indulged
in
wanderings
in
a
chapel
,
would
be
more
collected
in
a
*NL*
closet
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
likely
.
They
would
have
two
chances
at
least
in
their
favour
.
*NL*
There
would
be
less
to
distract
the
attention
from
without
,
and
it
would
*NL*
not
be
tried
so
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
mind
which
does
not
struggle
against
itself
under
_
one
_
*NL*
circumstance
,
would
find
objects
to
distract
it
in
the
_
other
_
,
I
*NL*
believe
;
and
the
influence
of
the
place
and
of
example
may
often
rouse
*NL*
better
feelings
than
are
begun
with
.
The
greater
length
of
the
service
,
*NL*
however
,
I
admit
to
be
sometimes
too
hard
a
stretch
upon
the
mind
.
One
*NL*
wishes
it
were
not
so
;
but
I
have
not
yet
left
Oxford
long
enough
to
*NL*
forget
what
chapel
prayers
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
this
was
passing
,
the
rest
of
the
party
being
scattered
about
the
*NL*
chapel
,
Julia
called
Mr.
Crawford
's
attention
to
her
sister
,
by
saying
,
*NL*
``
Do
look
at
Mr.
Rushworth
and
Maria
,
standing
side
by
side
,
exactly
as
*NL*
if
the
ceremony
were
going
to
be
performed
.
Have
not
they
completely
the
*NL*
air
of
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
smiled
his
acquiescence
,
and
stepping
forward
to
Maria
,
*NL*
said
,
in
a
voice
which
she
only
could
hear
,
``
I
do
not
like
to
see
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
so
near
the
altar
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Starting
,
the
lady
instinctively
moved
a
step
or
two
,
but
recovering
*NL*
herself
in
a
moment
,
affected
to
laugh
,
and
asked
him
,
in
a
tone
not
*NL*
much
louder
,
``
If
he
would
give
her
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
should
do
it
very
awkwardly
,
''
was
his
reply
,
with
a
look
*NL*
of
meaning
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
,
joining
them
at
the
moment
,
carried
on
the
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
it
is
really
a
pity
that
it
should
not
take
place
*NL*
directly
,
if
we
had
but
a
proper
licence
,
for
here
we
are
altogether
,
*NL*
and
nothing
in
the
world
could
be
more
snug
and
pleasant
.
''
And
she
*NL*
talked
and
laughed
about
it
with
so
little
caution
as
to
catch
the
*NL*
comprehension
of
Mr.
Rushworth
and
his
mother
,
and
expose
her
sister
to
*NL*
the
whispered
gallantries
of
her
lover
,
while
Mrs.
Rushworth
spoke
*NL*
with
proper
smiles
and
dignity
of
its
being
a
most
happy
event
to
her
*NL*
whenever
it
took
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Edmund
were
but
in
orders
!
''
cried
Julia
,
and
running
to
where
he
*NL*
stood
with
Miss
Crawford
and
Fanny
:
``
My
dear
Edmund
,
if
you
were
but
in
*NL*
orders
now
,
you
might
perform
the
ceremony
directly
.
How
unlucky
that
*NL*
you
are
not
ordained
;
Mr.
Rushworth
and
Maria
are
quite
ready
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
countenance
,
as
Julia
spoke
,
might
have
amused
a
*NL*
disinterested
observer
.
She
looked
almost
aghast
under
the
new
idea
she
*NL*
was
receiving
.
Fanny
pitied
her
.
``
How
distressed
she
will
be
at
what
she
*NL*
said
just
now
,
''
passed
across
her
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ordained
!
''
said
Miss
Crawford
;
``
what
,
are
you
to
be
a
clergyman
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
I
shall
take
orders
soon
after
my
father
's
return
--
probably
at
*NL*
Christmas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
,
rallying
her
spirits
,
and
recovering
her
complexion
,
*NL*
replied
only
,
``
If
I
had
known
this
before
,
I
would
have
spoken
of
the
*NL*
cloth
with
more
respect
,
''
and
turned
the
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chapel
was
soon
afterwards
left
to
the
silence
and
stillness
*NL*
which
reigned
in
it
,
with
few
interruptions
,
throughout
the
year
.
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
,
displeased
with
her
sister
,
led
the
way
,
and
all
seemed
to
feel
*NL*
that
they
had
been
there
long
enough
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
lower
part
of
the
house
had
been
now
entirely
shewn
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
,
never
weary
in
the
cause
,
would
have
proceeded
towards
the
*NL*
principal
staircase
,
and
taken
them
through
all
the
rooms
above
,
if
her
*NL*
son
had
not
interposed
with
a
doubt
of
there
being
time
enough
.
``
For
*NL*
if
,
''
said
he
,
with
the
sort
of
self-evident
proposition
which
many
a
*NL*
clearer
head
does
not
always
avoid
,
``
we
are
_
too
_
long
going
over
the
*NL*
house
,
we
shall
not
have
time
for
what
is
to
be
done
out
of
doors
.
It
is
*NL*
past
two
,
and
we
are
to
dine
at
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
submitted
;
and
the
question
of
surveying
the
grounds
,
*NL*
with
the
who
and
the
how
,
was
likely
to
be
more
fully
agitated
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
was
beginning
to
arrange
by
what
junction
of
carriages
and
horses
*NL*
most
could
be
done
,
when
the
young
people
,
meeting
with
an
outward
door
,
*NL*
temptingly
open
on
a
flight
of
steps
which
led
immediately
to
turf
and
*NL*
shrubs
,
and
all
the
sweets
of
pleasure-grounds
,
as
by
one
impulse
,
one
*NL*
wish
for
air
and
liberty
,
all
walked
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Suppose
we
turn
down
here
for
the
present
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
*NL*
civilly
taking
the
hint
and
following
them
.
``
Here
are
the
greatest
*NL*
number
of
our
plants
,
and
here
are
the
curious
pheasants
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Query
,
''
said
Mr.
Crawford
,
looking
round
him
,
``
whether
we
may
not
find
*NL*
something
to
employ
us
here
before
we
go
farther
?
I
see
walls
of
great
*NL*
promise
.
Mr.
Rushworth
,
shall
we
summon
a
council
on
this
lawn
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
James
,
''
said
Mrs.
Rushworth
to
her
son
,
``
I
believe
the
wilderness
*NL*
will
be
new
to
all
the
party
.
The
Miss
Bertrams
have
never
seen
the
*NL*
wilderness
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
objection
was
made
,
but
for
some
time
there
seemed
no
inclination
to
*NL*
move
in
any
plan
,
or
to
any
distance
.
All
were
attracted
at
first
by
the
*NL*
plants
or
the
pheasants
,
and
all
dispersed
about
in
happy
independence
.
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
was
the
first
to
move
forward
to
examine
the
capabilities
*NL*
of
that
end
of
the
house
.
The
lawn
,
bounded
on
each
side
by
a
high
wall
,
*NL*
contained
beyond
the
first
planted
area
a
bowling-green
,
and
beyond
*NL*
the
bowling-green
a
long
terrace
walk
,
backed
by
iron
palisades
,
and
*NL*
commanding
a
view
over
them
into
the
tops
of
the
trees
of
the
wilderness
*NL*
immediately
adjoining
.
It
was
a
good
spot
for
fault-finding
.
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
was
soon
followed
by
Miss
Bertram
and
Mr.
Rushworth
;
and
when
,
*NL*
after
a
little
time
,
the
others
began
to
form
into
parties
,
these
three
*NL*
were
found
in
busy
consultation
on
the
terrace
by
Edmund
,
Miss
Crawford
,
*NL*
and
Fanny
,
who
seemed
as
naturally
to
unite
,
and
who
,
after
a
short
*NL*
participation
of
their
regrets
and
difficulties
,
left
them
and
walked
*NL*
on
.
The
remaining
three
,
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
Julia
,
were
*NL*
still
far
behind
;
for
Julia
,
whose
happy
star
no
longer
prevailed
,
*NL*
was
obliged
to
keep
by
the
side
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
and
restrain
her
*NL*
impatient
feet
to
that
lady
's
slow
pace
,
while
her
aunt
,
having
fallen
*NL*
in
with
the
housekeeper
,
who
was
come
out
to
feed
the
pheasants
,
was
*NL*
lingering
behind
in
gossip
with
her
.
Poor
Julia
,
the
only
one
out
of
*NL*
the
nine
not
tolerably
satisfied
with
their
lot
,
was
now
in
a
state
of
*NL*
complete
penance
,
and
as
different
from
the
Julia
of
the
barouche-box
as
*NL*
could
well
be
imagined
.
The
politeness
which
she
had
been
brought
up
to
*NL*
practise
as
a
duty
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
escape
;
while
the
*NL*
want
of
that
higher
species
of
self-command
,
that
just
consideration
of
*NL*
others
,
that
knowledge
of
her
own
heart
,
that
principle
of
right
,
which
*NL*
had
not
formed
any
essential
part
of
her
education
,
made
her
miserable
*NL*
under
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
insufferably
hot
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
when
they
had
taken
one
*NL*
turn
on
the
terrace
,
and
were
drawing
a
second
time
to
the
door
in
the
*NL*
middle
which
opened
to
the
wilderness
.
``
Shall
any
of
us
object
to
being
*NL*
comfortable
?
Here
is
a
nice
little
wood
,
if
one
can
but
get
into
it
.
*NL*
What
happiness
if
the
door
should
not
be
locked
!
but
of
course
it
is
;
*NL*
for
in
these
great
places
the
gardeners
are
the
only
people
who
can
go
*NL*
where
they
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
door
,
however
,
proved
not
to
be
locked
,
and
they
were
all
agreed
in
*NL*
turning
joyfully
through
it
,
and
leaving
the
unmitigated
glare
of
day
*NL*
behind
.
A
considerable
flight
of
steps
landed
them
in
the
wilderness
,
*NL*
which
was
a
planted
wood
of
about
two
acres
,
and
though
chiefly
of
*NL*
larch
and
laurel
,
and
beech
cut
down
,
and
though
laid
out
with
too
much
*NL*
regularity
,
was
darkness
and
shade
,
and
natural
beauty
,
compared
with
*NL*
the
bowling-green
and
the
terrace
.
They
all
felt
the
refreshment
of
it
,
*NL*
and
for
some
time
could
only
walk
and
admire
.
At
length
,
after
a
short
*NL*
pause
,
Miss
Crawford
began
with
,
``
So
you
are
to
be
a
clergyman
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
.
This
is
rather
a
surprise
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
it
surprise
you
?
You
must
suppose
me
designed
for
some
*NL*
profession
,
and
might
perceive
that
I
am
neither
a
lawyer
,
nor
a
*NL*
soldier
,
nor
a
sailor
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
;
but
,
in
short
,
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
.
And
you
know
there
*NL*
is
generally
an
uncle
or
a
grandfather
to
leave
a
fortune
to
the
second
*NL*
son
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
very
praiseworthy
practice
,
''
said
Edmund
,
``
but
not
quite
universal
.
*NL*
I
am
one
of
the
exceptions
,
and
_
being
_
one
,
must
do
something
for
*NL*
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
why
are
you
to
be
a
clergyman
?
I
thought
_
that
_
was
always
the
lot
*NL*
of
the
youngest
,
where
there
were
many
to
chuse
before
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
the
church
itself
never
chosen
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Never
_
is
a
black
word
.
But
yes
,
in
the
_
never
_
of
conversation
,
which
*NL*
means
_
not
_
_
very
_
_
often
_
,
I
do
think
it
.
For
what
is
to
be
done
in
the
*NL*
church
?
Men
love
to
distinguish
themselves
,
and
in
either
of
the
other
*NL*
lines
distinction
may
be
gained
,
but
not
in
the
church
.
A
clergyman
is
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
_
nothing
_
of
conversation
has
its
gradations
,
I
hope
,
as
well
as
*NL*
the
_
never
_
.
A
clergyman
can
not
be
high
in
state
or
fashion
.
He
must
*NL*
not
head
mobs
,
or
set
the
ton
in
dress
.
But
I
can
not
call
that
situation
*NL*
nothing
which
has
the
charge
of
all
that
is
of
the
first
importance
*NL*
to
mankind
,
individually
or
collectively
considered
,
temporally
and
*NL*
eternally
,
which
has
the
guardianship
of
religion
and
morals
,
and
*NL*
consequently
of
the
manners
which
result
from
their
influence
.
No
one
*NL*
here
can
call
the
_
office
_
nothing
.
If
the
man
who
holds
it
is
so
,
it
*NL*
is
by
the
neglect
of
his
duty
,
by
foregoing
its
just
importance
,
and
*NL*
stepping
out
of
his
place
to
appear
what
he
ought
not
to
appear
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
assign
greater
consequence
to
the
clergyman
than
one
has
been
*NL*
used
to
hear
given
,
or
than
I
can
quite
comprehend
.
One
does
not
see
*NL*
much
of
this
influence
and
importance
in
society
,
and
how
can
it
be
*NL*
acquired
where
they
are
so
seldom
seen
themselves
?
How
can
two
sermons
a
*NL*
week
,
even
supposing
them
worth
hearing
,
supposing
the
preacher
to
have
*NL*
the
sense
to
prefer
Blair
's
to
his
own
,
do
all
that
you
speak
of
?
govern
*NL*
the
conduct
and
fashion
the
manners
of
a
large
congregation
for
the
rest
*NL*
of
the
week
?
One
scarcely
sees
a
clergyman
out
of
his
pulpit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
You
_
are
speaking
of
London
,
_
I
_
am
speaking
of
the
nation
at
large
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
metropolis
,
I
imagine
,
is
a
pretty
fair
sample
of
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
,
I
should
hope
,
of
the
proportion
of
virtue
to
vice
throughout
the
*NL*
kingdom
.
We
do
not
look
in
great
cities
for
our
best
morality
.
It
is
not
*NL*
there
that
respectable
people
of
any
denomination
can
do
most
good
;
and
*NL*
it
certainly
is
not
there
that
the
influence
of
the
clergy
can
be
most
*NL*
felt
.
A
fine
preacher
is
followed
and
admired
;
but
it
is
not
in
fine
*NL*
preaching
only
that
a
good
clergyman
will
be
useful
in
his
parish
and
*NL*
his
neighbourhood
,
where
the
parish
and
neighbourhood
are
of
a
size
*NL*
capable
of
knowing
his
private
character
,
and
observing
his
general
*NL*
conduct
,
which
in
London
can
rarely
be
the
case
.
The
clergy
are
lost
*NL*
there
in
the
crowds
of
their
parishioners
.
They
are
known
to
the
largest
*NL*
part
only
as
preachers
.
And
with
regard
to
their
influencing
public
*NL*
manners
,
Miss
Crawford
must
not
misunderstand
me
,
or
suppose
I
mean
to
*NL*
call
them
the
arbiters
of
good-breeding
,
the
regulators
of
refinement
*NL*
and
courtesy
,
the
masters
of
the
ceremonies
of
life
.
The
_
manners
_
I
*NL*
speak
of
might
rather
be
called
_
conduct
_
,
perhaps
,
the
result
of
good
*NL*
principles
;
the
effect
,
in
short
,
of
those
doctrines
which
it
is
their
*NL*
duty
to
teach
and
recommend
;
and
it
will
,
I
believe
,
be
everywhere
*NL*
found
,
that
as
the
clergy
are
,
or
are
not
what
they
ought
to
be
,
so
are
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
nation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
''
said
Fanny
,
with
gentle
earnestness
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
,
''
cried
Miss
Crawford
,
``
you
have
quite
convinced
Miss
Price
*NL*
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
I
could
convince
Miss
Crawford
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
you
ever
will

''
said
she
,
with
an
arch
smile
;
``
I
am
just
*NL*
as
much
surprised
now
as
I
was
at
first
that
you
should
intend
to
take
*NL*
orders
.
You
really
are
fit
for
something
better
.
Come
,
do
change
your
*NL*
mind
.
It
is
not
too
late
.
Go
into
the
law

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Go
into
the
law
!
With
as
much
ease
as
I
was
told
to
go
into
this
*NL*
wilderness
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
you
are
going
to
say
something
about
law
being
the
worst
wilderness
*NL*
of
the
two

I
forestall
you
;
remember
,
I
have
forestalled
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
You
need
not
hurry
when
the
object
is
only
to
prevent
my
saying
a
*NL*
_
bon
_
_
mot

,
for
there
is
not
the
least
wit
in
my
nature
.
I
am
a
very
*NL*
matter-of-fact

plain-spoken
being

may
blunder
on
the
borders
of
a
*NL*
repartee
for
half
an
hour
together
without
striking
it
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
general
silence
succeeded
.
Each
was
thoughtful
.
Fanny
made
the
first
*NL*
interruption
by
saying
,
``
I
wonder
that
I
should
be
tired
with
only
*NL*
walking
in
this
sweet
wood
;
but
the
next
time
we
come
to
a
seat
,
if
it
*NL*
is
not
disagreeable
to
you
,
I
should
be
glad
to
sit
down
for
a
little
*NL*
while
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Fanny
,
''
cried
Edmund
,
immediately
drawing
her
arm
within
his
,
*NL*
``
how
thoughtless
I
have
been
!
I
hope
you
are
not
very
tired

Perhaps
,
''
*NL*
turning
to
Miss
Crawford
,
``
my
other
companion
may
do
me
the
honour
of
*NL*
taking
an
arm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
but
I
am
not
at
all
tired

''
She
took
it
,
however
,
as
she
*NL*
spoke
,
and
the
gratification
of
having
her
do
so
,
of
feeling
such
a
*NL*
connexion
for
the
first
time
,
made
him
a
little
forgetful
of
Fanny
.
*NL*
``
You
scarcely
touch
me
,
''
said
he
.
``
You
do
not
make
me
of
any
use

What
a
*NL*
difference
in
the
weight
of
a
woman
's
arm
from
that
of
a
man
!
At
Oxford
*NL*
I
have
been
a
good
deal
used
to
have
a
man
lean
on
me
for
the
length
of

a
street

you
are
only
a
fly
in
the
comparison

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
really
not
tired

which
I
almost
wonder
at
;
for
we
must
have
*NL*
walked
at

a
mile
in
this
wood
.
Do
not
you
think
we
have
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
half
a
mile

''
was
his
sturdy
answer
;
for
he
was
not
yet
so
much
in
*NL*
love
as
to
measure
distance
,
or
reckon
time
,
with
feminine
lawlessness

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

you
do
not
consider
how
much
we

wound
about

We
have
taken

such
a
very
serpentine
course
,
and
the
wood
itself
must
be
half
a
mile

long
in
a
straight
line

We
looked
down
the
whole
vista

saw
it
*NL*
closed
by
iron
gates

it

not

been
more
than

length

that
we
have
been
winding
in

out
ever
since
we
came
into

it

therefore

when
I
say

out

*NL*
*NL*
A
few
steps
farther
brought
them
out
at
the
bottom
of
the
very
walk

been
talking
of
;

standing
back

well
shaded

sheltered

looking
over
a

into

was
a
comfortable-sized
bench

all
sat
down

up
again

_
with
a
glance
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
still
reasoned
with
her
,
but
in
vain
.
She
would
not
calculate
,
she
*NL*
would
not
compare
.
She
would
only
smile
and
assert
.
The
greatest
degree
*NL*
of
rational
consistency
could
not
have
been
more
engaging
,
and
they
*NL*
talked
with
mutual
satisfaction
.
At
last
it
was
agreed
that
they
should
*NL*
endeavour
to
determine
the
dimensions
of
the
wood
by
walking
a
little
*NL*
more
about
it
.
They
would
go
to
one
end
of
it
,
in
the
line
they
were
*NL*
then
in
--
for
there
was
a
straight
green
walk
along
the
bottom
by
*NL*
the
side
of
the
ha-ha
--
and
perhaps
turn
a
little
way
in
some
other
*NL*
direction
,
if
it
seemed
likely
to
assist
them
,
and
be
back
in
a
few
*NL*
minutes
.
Fanny
said
she
was
rested
,
and
would
have
moved
too
,
but
this
*NL*
was
not
suffered
.
Edmund
urged
her
remaining
where
she
was
with
an
*NL*
earnestness
which
she
could
not
resist
,
and
she
was
left
on
the
bench
to
*NL*
think
with
pleasure
of
her
cousin
's
care
,
but
with
great
regret
that
she
*NL*
was
not
stronger
.
She
watched
them
till
they
had
turned
the
corner
,
and
*NL*
listened
till
all
sound
of
them
had
ceased
.

CHAPTER
X
*NL*
*NL*
A
quarter
of
an
hour
,
twenty
minutes
,
passed
away
,
and
Fanny
was
still
*NL*
thinking
of
Edmund
,
Miss
Crawford
,
and
herself
,
without
interruption
*NL*
from
any
one
.
She
began
to
be
surprised
at
being
left
so
long
,
and
to
*NL*
listen
with
an
anxious
desire
of
hearing
their
steps
and
their
voices
*NL*
again
.
She
listened
,
and
at
length
she
heard
;
she
heard
voices
and
feet
*NL*
approaching
;
but
she
had
just
satisfied
herself
that
it
was
not
those
*NL*
she
wanted
,
when
Miss
Bertram
,
Mr.
Rushworth
,
and
Mr.
Crawford
issued
*NL*
from
the
same
path
which
she
had
trod
herself
,
and
were
before
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Price
all
alone
''
and
``
My
dear
Fanny
,
how
comes
this
?
''
were
the
*NL*
first
salutations
.
She
told
her
story
.
``
Poor
dear
Fanny
,
''
cried
her
*NL*
cousin
,
``
how
ill
you
have
been
used
by
them
!
You
had
better
have
staid
*NL*
with
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Then
seating
herself
with
a
gentleman
on
each
side
,
she
resumed
*NL*
the
conversation
which
had
engaged
them
before
,
and
discussed
the
*NL*
possibility
of
improvements
with
much
animation
.
Nothing
was
fixed
*NL*
on
;
but
Henry
Crawford
was
full
of
ideas
and
projects
,
and
,
generally
*NL*
speaking
,
whatever
he
proposed
was
immediately
approved
,
first
by
her
,
*NL*
and
then
by
Mr.
Rushworth
,
whose
principal
business
seemed
to
be
to
*NL*
hear
the
others
,
and
who
scarcely
risked
an
original
thought
of
his
own
*NL*
beyond
a
wish
that
they
had
seen
his
friend
Smith
's
place
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
some
minutes
spent
in
this
way
,
Miss
Bertram
,
observing
the
iron
*NL*
gate
,
expressed
a
wish
of
passing
through
it
into
the
park
,
that
their
*NL*
views
and
their
plans
might
be
more
comprehensive
.
It
was
the
very
thing
*NL*
of
all
others
to
be
wished
,
it
was
the
best
,
it
was
the
only
way
of
*NL*
proceeding
with
any
advantage
,
in
Henry
Crawford
's
opinion
;
and
he
*NL*
directly
saw
a
knoll
not
half
a
mile
off
,
which
would
give
them
exactly
*NL*
the
requisite
command
of
the
house
.
Go
therefore
they
must
to
that
*NL*
knoll
,
and
through
that
gate
;
but
the
gate
was
locked
.
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
wished
he
had
brought
the
key
;
he
had
been
very
near
thinking
whether
he
*NL*
should
not
bring
the
key
;
he
was
determined
he
would
never
come
without
*NL*
the
key
again
;
but
still
this
did
not
remove
the
present
evil
.
They
*NL*
could
not
get
through
;
and
as
Miss
Bertram
's
inclination
for
so
doing
*NL*
did
by
no
means
lessen
,
it
ended
in
Mr.
Rushworth
's
declaring
outright
*NL*
that
he
would
go
and
fetch
the
key
.
He
set
off
accordingly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
undoubtedly
the
best
thing
we
can
do
now
,
as
we
are
so
far
from
*NL*
the
house
already
,
''
said
Mr.
Crawford
,
when
he
was
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
there
is
nothing
else
to
be
done
.
But
now
,
sincerely
,
do
not
you
*NL*
find
the
place
altogether
worse
than
you
expected
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
far
otherwise
.
I
find
it
better
,
grander
,
more
complete
in
*NL*
its
style
,
though
that
style
may
not
be
the
best
.
And
to
tell
you
the
*NL*
truth
,
''
speaking
rather
lower
,
``
I
do
not
think
that
_
I
_
shall
ever
see
*NL*
Sotherton
again
with
so
much
pleasure
as
I
do
now
.
Another
summer
will
*NL*
hardly
improve
it
to
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
embarrassment
the
lady
replied
,
``
You
are
too
much
a
*NL*
man
of
the
world
not
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
the
world
.
If
other
people
*NL*
think
Sotherton
improved
,
I
have
no
doubt
that
you
will
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
I
am
not
quite
so
much
the
man
of
the
world
as
might
be
*NL*
good
for
me
in
some
points
.
My
feelings
are
not
quite
so
evanescent
,
nor
*NL*
my
memory
of
the
past
under
such
easy
dominion
as
one
finds
to
be
the
*NL*
case
with
men
of
the
world
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
followed
by
a
short
silence
.
Miss
Bertram
began
again
.
``
You
*NL*
seemed
to
enjoy
your
drive
here
very
much
this
morning
.
I
was
glad
to
*NL*
see
you
so
well
entertained
.
You
and
Julia
were
laughing
the
whole
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Were
we
?
Yes
,
I
believe
we
were
;
but
I
have
not
the
least
recollection
*NL*
at
what
.
Oh
!
I
believe
I
was
relating
to
her
some
ridiculous
stories
of
*NL*
an
old
Irish
groom
of
my
uncle
's
.
Your
sister
loves
to
laugh
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
think
her
more
light-hearted
than
I
am
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
More
easily
amused
,
''
he
replied
;
``
consequently
,
you
know
,
''
smiling
,
*NL*
``
better
company
.
I
could
not
have
hoped
to
entertain
you
with
Irish
*NL*
anecdotes
during
a
ten
miles
'
drive
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Naturally
,
I
believe
,
I
am
as
lively
as
Julia
,
but
I
have
more
to
think
*NL*
of
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
,
undoubtedly
;
and
there
are
situations
in
which
very
high
*NL*
spirits
would
denote
insensibility
.
Your
prospects
,
however
,
are
too
*NL*
fair
to
justify
want
of
spirits
.
You
have
a
very
smiling
scene
before
*NL*
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
literally
or
figuratively
?
Literally
,
I
conclude
.
Yes
,
*NL*
certainly
,
the
sun
shines
,
and
the
park
looks
very
cheerful
.
But
*NL*
unluckily
that
iron
gate
,
that
ha-ha
,
give
me
a
feeling
of
restraint
and
*NL*
hardship
.
'
I
can
not
get
out
,
'
as
the
starling
said
.
''
As
she
spoke
,
and
*NL*
it
was
with
expression
,
she
walked
to
the
gate
:
he
followed
her
.
``
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
is
so
long
fetching
this
key
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
for
the
world
you
would
not
get
out
without
the
key
and
without
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
authority
and
protection
,
or
I
think
you
might
with
little
*NL*
difficulty
pass
round
the
edge
of
the
gate
,
here
,
with
my
assistance
;
*NL*
I
think
it
might
be
done
,
if
you
really
wished
to
be
more
at
large
,
and
*NL*
could
allow
yourself
to
think
it
not
prohibited
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Prohibited
!
nonsense
!
I
certainly
can
get
out
that
way
,
and
I
will
.
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
will
be
here
in
a
moment
,
you
know
;
we
shall
not
be
out
of
*NL*
sight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Or
if
we
are
,
Miss
Price
will
be
so
good
as
to
tell
him
that
he
will
*NL*
find
us
near
that
knoll
:
the
grove
of
oak
on
the
knoll
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
feeling
all
this
to
be
wrong
,
could
not
help
making
an
effort
to
*NL*
prevent
it
.
``
You
will
hurt
yourself
,
Miss
Bertram
,
''
she
cried
;
``
you
will
*NL*
certainly
hurt
yourself
against
those
spikes
;
you
will
tear
your
gown
;
*NL*
you
will
be
in
danger
of
slipping
into
the
ha-ha
.
You
had
better
not
*NL*
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
cousin
was
safe
on
the
other
side
while
these
words
were
spoken
,
*NL*
and
,
smiling
with
all
the
good-humour
of
success
,
she
said
,
``
Thank
you
,
*NL*
my
dear
Fanny
,
but
I
and
my
gown
are
alive
and
well
,
and
so
good-bye
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
again
left
to
her
solitude
,
and
with
no
increase
of
pleasant
*NL*
feelings
,
for
she
was
sorry
for
almost
all
that
she
had
seen
and
heard
,
*NL*
astonished
at
Miss
Bertram
,
and
angry
with
Mr.
Crawford
.
By
taking
*NL*
a
circuitous
route
,
and
,
as
it
appeared
to
her
,
very
unreasonable
*NL*
direction
to
the
knoll
,
they
were
soon
beyond
her
eye
;
and
for
some
*NL*
minutes
longer
she
remained
without
sight
or
sound
of
any
companion
.
*NL*
She
seemed
to
have
the
little
wood
all
to
herself
.
She
could
almost
*NL*
have
thought
that
Edmund
and
Miss
Crawford
had
left
it
,
but
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
for
Edmund
to
forget
her
so
entirely
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
again
roused
from
disagreeable
musings
by
sudden
footsteps
:
*NL*
somebody
was
coming
at
a
quick
pace
down
the
principal
walk
.
She
*NL*
expected
Mr.
Rushworth
,
but
it
was
Julia
,
who
,
hot
and
out
of
breath
,
*NL*
and
with
a
look
of
disappointment
,
cried
out
on
seeing
her
,
``
Heyday
!
*NL*
Where
are
the
others
?
I
thought
Maria
and
Mr.
Crawford
were
with
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
explained
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
trick
,
upon
my
word
!
I
can
not
see
them
anywhere
,
''
looking
*NL*
eagerly
into
the
park
.
``
But
they
can
not
be
very
far
off
,
and
I
think
I
*NL*
am
equal
to
as
much
as
Maria
,
even
without
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Julia
,
Mr.
Rushworth
will
be
here
in
a
moment
with
the
key
.
Do
*NL*
wait
for
Mr.
Rushworth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
I
,
indeed
.
I
have
had
enough
of
the
family
for
one
morning
.
Why
,
*NL*
child
,
I
have
but
this
moment
escaped
from
his
horrible
mother
.
Such
a
*NL*
penance
as
I
have
been
enduring
,
while
you
were
sitting
here
so
composed
*NL*
and
so
happy
!
It
might
have
been
as
well
,
perhaps
,
if
you
had
been
in
my
*NL*
place
,
but
you
always
contrive
to
keep
out
of
these
scrapes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
most
unjust
reflection
,
but
Fanny
could
allow
for
it
,
and
let
*NL*
it
pass
:
Julia
was
vexed
,
and
her
temper
was
hasty
;
but
she
felt
that
it
*NL*
would
not
last
,
and
therefore
,
taking
no
notice
,
only
asked
her
if
she
*NL*
had
not
seen
Mr.
Rushworth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
we
saw
him
.
He
was
posting
away
as
if
upon
life
and
death
,
*NL*
and
could
but
just
spare
time
to
tell
us
his
errand
,
and
where
you
all
*NL*
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
pity
he
should
have
so
much
trouble
for
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
_
is
Miss
Maria
's
concern
.
I
am
not
obliged
to
punish
myself
for
*NL*
_
her
_
sins
.
The
mother
I
could
not
avoid
,
as
long
as
my
tiresome
aunt
*NL*
was
dancing
about
with
the
housekeeper
,
but
the
son
I
_
can
_
get
away
*NL*
from
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
she
immediately
scrambled
across
the
fence
,
and
walked
away
,
not
*NL*
attending
to
Fanny
's
last
question
of
whether
she
had
seen
anything
of
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
and
Edmund
.
The
sort
of
dread
in
which
Fanny
now
sat
of
*NL*
seeing
Mr.
Rushworth
prevented
her
thinking
so
much
of
their
continued
*NL*
absence
,
however
,
as
she
might
have
done
.
She
felt
that
he
had
been
*NL*
very
ill-used
,
and
was
quite
unhappy
in
having
to
communicate
what
had
*NL*
passed
.
He
joined
her
within
five
minutes
after
Julia
's
exit
;
and
*NL*
though
she
made
the
best
of
the
story
,
he
was
evidently
mortified
and
*NL*
displeased
in
no
common
degree
.
At
first
he
scarcely
said
anything
;
his
*NL*
looks
only
expressed
his
extreme
surprise
and
vexation
,
and
he
walked
to
*NL*
the
gate
and
stood
there
,
without
seeming
to
know
what
to
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
desired
me
to
stay
--
my
cousin
Maria
charged
me
to
say
that
you
*NL*
would
find
them
at
that
knoll
,
or
thereabouts
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
believe
I
shall
go
any
farther
,
''
said
he
sullenly
;
``
I
see
*NL*
nothing
of
them
.
By
the
time
I
get
to
the
knoll
they
may
be
gone
*NL*
somewhere
else
.
I
have
had
walking
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
he
sat
down
with
a
most
gloomy
countenance
by
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
''
said
she
;
``
it
is
very
unlucky
.
''
And
she
longed
to
be
*NL*
able
to
say
something
more
to
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
an
interval
of
silence
,
``
I
think
they
might
as
well
have
staid
for
*NL*
me
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Bertram
thought
you
would
follow
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
had
to
follow
her
if
she
had
staid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
could
not
be
denied
,
and
Fanny
was
silenced
.
After
another
pause
,
*NL*
he
went
on
--
``
Pray
,
Miss
Price
,
are
you
such
a
great
admirer
of
this
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
as
some
people
are
?
For
my
part
,
I
can
see
nothing
in
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
think
him
at
all
handsome
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Handsome
!
Nobody
can
call
such
an
undersized
man
handsome
.
He
is
not
*NL*
five
foot
nine
.
I
should
not
wonder
if
he
is
not
more
than
five
foot
*NL*
eight
.
I
think
he
is
an
ill-looking
fellow
.
In
my
opinion
,
these
*NL*
Crawfords
are
no
addition
at
all
.
We
did
very
well
without
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
small
sigh
escaped
Fanny
here
,
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
contradict
*NL*
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
made
any
difficulty
about
fetching
the
key
,
there
might
have
*NL*
been
some
excuse
,
but
I
went
the
very
moment
she
said
she
wanted
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
could
be
more
obliging
than
your
manner
,
I
am
sure
,
and
I
dare
*NL*
say
you
walked
as
fast
as
you
could
;
but
still
it
is
some
distance
,
you
*NL*
know
,
from
this
spot
to
the
house
,
quite
into
the
house
;
and
when
people
*NL*
are
waiting
,
they
are
bad
judges
of
time
,
and
every
half
minute
seems
*NL*
like
five
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
got
up
and
walked
to
the
gate
again
,
and
``
wished
he
had
had
the
key
*NL*
about
him
at
the
time
.
''
Fanny
thought
she
discerned
in
his
standing
*NL*
there
an
indication
of
relenting
,
which
encouraged
her
to
another
*NL*
attempt
,
and
she
said
,
therefore
,
``
It
is
a
pity
you
should
not
join
*NL*
them
.
They
expected
to
have
a
better
view
of
the
house
from
that
part
*NL*
of
the
park
,
and
will
be
thinking
how
it
may
be
improved
;
and
nothing
of
*NL*
that
sort
,
you
know
,
can
be
settled
without
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
found
herself
more
successful
in
sending
away
than
in
retaining
a
*NL*
companion
.
Mr.
Rushworth
was
worked
on
.
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
``
if
you
*NL*
really
think
I
had
better
go
:
it
would
be
foolish
to
bring
the
key
*NL*
for
nothing
.
''
And
letting
himself
out
,
he
walked
off
without
farther
*NL*
ceremony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
thoughts
were
now
all
engrossed
by
the
two
who
had
left
her
so
*NL*
long
ago
,
and
getting
quite
impatient
,
she
resolved
to
go
in
search
*NL*
of
them
.
She
followed
their
steps
along
the
bottom
walk
,
and
had
just
*NL*
turned
up
into
another
,
when
the
voice
and
the
laugh
of
Miss
Crawford
*NL*
once
more
caught
her
ear
;
the
sound
approached
,
and
a
few
more
windings
*NL*
brought
them
before
her
.
They
were
just
returned
into
the
wilderness
*NL*
from
the
park
,
to
which
a
sidegate
,
not
fastened
,
had
tempted
them
very
*NL*
soon
after
their
leaving
her
,
and
they
had
been
across
a
portion
of
the
*NL*
park
into
the
very
avenue
which
Fanny
had
been
hoping
the
whole
morning
*NL*
to
reach
at
last
,
and
had
been
sitting
down
under
one
of
the
trees
.
This
*NL*
was
their
history
.
It
was
evident
that
they
had
been
spending
their
time
*NL*
pleasantly
,
and
were
not
aware
of
the
length
of
their
absence
.
Fanny
's
*NL*
best
consolation
was
in
being
assured
that
Edmund
had
wished
for
her
*NL*
very
much
,
and
that
he
should
certainly
have
come
back
for
her
,
had
she
*NL*
not
been
tired
already
;
but
this
was
not
quite
sufficient
to
do
away
*NL*
with
the
pain
of
having
been
left
a
whole
hour
,
when
he
had
talked
of
*NL*
only
a
few
minutes
,
nor
to
banish
the
sort
of
curiosity
she
felt
to
know
*NL*
what
they
had
been
conversing
about
all
that
time
;
and
the
result
of
*NL*
the
whole
was
to
her
disappointment
and
depression
,
as
they
prepared
by
*NL*
general
agreement
to
return
to
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
the
bottom
of
the
steps
to
the
terrace
,
Mrs.
Rushworth
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Norris
presented
themselves
at
the
top
,
just
ready
for
the
*NL*
wilderness
,
at
the
end
of
an
hour
and
a
half
from
their
leaving
the
*NL*
house
.
Mrs.
Norris
had
been
too
well
employed
to
move
faster
.
Whatever
*NL*
cross-accidents
had
occurred
to
intercept
the
pleasures
of
her
nieces
,
*NL*
she
had
found
a
morning
of
complete
enjoyment
;
for
the
housekeeper
,
*NL*
after
a
great
many
courtesies
on
the
subject
of
pheasants
,
had
taken
her
*NL*
to
the
dairy
,
told
her
all
about
their
cows
,
and
given
her
the
receipt
*NL*
for
a
famous
cream
cheese
;
and
since
Julia
's
leaving
them
they
had
*NL*
been
met
by
the
gardener
,
with
whom
she
had
made
a
most
satisfactory
*NL*
acquaintance
,
for
she
had
set
him
right
as
to
his
grandson
's
illness
,
*NL*
convinced
him
that
it
was
an
ague
,
and
promised
him
a
charm
for
it
;
and
*NL*
he
,
in
return
,
had
shewn
her
all
his
choicest
nursery
of
plants
,
and
*NL*
actually
presented
her
with
a
very
curious
specimen
of
heath
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
this
_
rencontre
_
they
all
returned
to
the
house
together
,
there
*NL*
to
lounge
away
the
time
as
they
could
with
sofas
,
and
chit-chat
,
and
*NL*
Quarterly
Reviews
,
till
the
return
of
the
others
,
and
the
arrival
of
*NL*
dinner
.
It
was
late
before
the
Miss
Bertrams
and
the
two
gentlemen
came
*NL*
in
,
and
their
ramble
did
not
appear
to
have
been
more
than
partially
*NL*
agreeable
,
or
at
all
productive
of
anything
useful
with
regard
to
the
*NL*
object
of
the
day
.
By
their
own
accounts
they
had
been
all
walking
after
*NL*
each
other
,
and
the
junction
which
had
taken
place
at
last
seemed
,
to
*NL*
Fanny
's
observation
,
to
have
been
as
much
too
late
for
re-establishing
*NL*
harmony
,
as
it
confessedly
had
been
for
determining
on
any
alteration
.
*NL*
She
felt
,
as
she
looked
at
Julia
and
Mr.
Rushworth
,
that
hers
was
not
*NL*
the
only
dissatisfied
bosom
amongst
them
:
there
was
gloom
on
the
face
of
*NL*
each
.
Mr.
Crawford
and
Miss
Bertram
were
much
more
gay
,
and
she
thought
*NL*
that
he
was
taking
particular
pains
,
during
dinner
,
to
do
away
any
*NL*
little
resentment
of
the
other
two
,
and
restore
general
good-humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
was
soon
followed
by
tea
and
coffee
,
a
ten
miles
'
drive
home
*NL*
allowed
no
waste
of
hours
;
and
from
the
time
of
their
sitting
down
to
*NL*
table
,
it
was
a
quick
succession
of
busy
nothings
till
the
carriage
came
*NL*
to
the
door
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
having
fidgeted
about
,
and
obtained
a
*NL*
few
pheasants
'
eggs
and
a
cream
cheese
from
the
housekeeper
,
and
made
*NL*
abundance
of
civil
speeches
to
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
was
ready
to
lead
the
*NL*
way
.
At
the
same
moment
Mr.
Crawford
,
approaching
Julia
,
said
,
``
I
hope
I
*NL*
am
not
to
lose
my
companion
,
unless
she
is
afraid
of
the
evening
air
*NL*
in
so
exposed
a
seat
.
''
The
request
had
not
been
foreseen
,
but
was
very
*NL*
graciously
received
,
and
Julia
's
day
was
likely
to
end
almost
as
well
as
*NL*
it
began
.
Miss
Bertram
had
made
up
her
mind
to
something
different
,
and
*NL*
was
a
little
disappointed
;
but
her
conviction
of
being
really
the
*NL*
one
preferred
comforted
her
under
it
,
and
enabled
her
to
receive
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
parting
attentions
as
she
ought
.
He
was
certainly
better
*NL*
pleased
to
hand
her
into
the
barouche
than
to
assist
her
in
ascending
*NL*
the
box
,
and
his
complacency
seemed
confirmed
by
the
arrangement
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Fanny
,
this
has
been
a
fine
day
for
you
,
upon
my
word
,
''
said
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
as
they
drove
through
the
park
.
``
Nothing
but
pleasure
from
*NL*
beginning
to
end
!
I
am
sure
you
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
your
*NL*
aunt
Bertram
and
me
for
contriving
to
let
you
go
.
A
pretty
good
day
's
*NL*
amusement
you
have
had
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
was
just
discontented
enough
to
say
directly
,
``
I
think
_
you
_
have
*NL*
done
pretty
well
yourself
,
ma'am
.
Your
lap
seems
full
of
good
things
,
*NL*
and
here
is
a
basket
of
something
between
us
which
has
been
knocking
my
*NL*
elbow
unmercifully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
it
is
only
a
beautiful
little
heath
,
which
that
nice
old
*NL*
gardener
would
make
me
take
;
but
if
it
is
in
your
way
,
I
will
have
it
in
*NL*
my
lap
directly
.
There
,
Fanny
,
you
shall
carry
that
parcel
for
me
;
take
*NL*
great
care
of
it
:
do
not
let
it
fall
;
it
is
a
cream
cheese
,
just
like
*NL*
the
excellent
one
we
had
at
dinner
.
Nothing
would
satisfy
that
good
old
*NL*
Mrs.
Whitaker
,
but
my
taking
one
of
the
cheeses
.
I
stood
out
as
long
*NL*
as
I
could
,
till
the
tears
almost
came
into
her
eyes
,
and
I
knew
it
was
*NL*
just
the
sort
that
my
sister
would
be
delighted
with
.
That
Mrs.
Whitaker
*NL*
is
a
treasure
!
She
was
quite
shocked
when
I
asked
her
whether
wine
was
*NL*
allowed
at
the
second
table
,
and
she
has
turned
away
two
housemaids
for
*NL*
wearing
white
gowns
.
Take
care
of
the
cheese
,
Fanny
.
Now
I
can
manage
*NL*
the
other
parcel
and
the
basket
very
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
else
have
you
been
spunging
?
''
said
Maria
,
half-pleased
that
*NL*
Sotherton
should
be
so
complimented
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Spunging
,
my
dear
!
It
is
nothing
but
four
of
those
beautiful
pheasants
'
*NL*
eggs
,
which
Mrs.
Whitaker
would
quite
force
upon
me
:
she
would
not
take
*NL*
a
denial
.
She
said
it
must
be
such
an
amusement
to
me
,
as
she
understood
*NL*
I
lived
quite
alone
,
to
have
a
few
living
creatures
of
that
sort
;
and
*NL*
so
to
be
sure
it
will
.
I
shall
get
the
dairymaid
to
set
them
under
the
*NL*
first
spare
hen
,
and
if
they
come
to
good
I
can
have
them
moved
to
my
*NL*
own
house
and
borrow
a
coop
;
and
it
will
be
a
great
delight
to
me
in
*NL*
my
lonely
hours
to
attend
to
them
.
And
if
I
have
good
luck
,
your
mother
*NL*
shall
have
some
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
beautiful
evening
,
mild
and
still
,
and
the
drive
was
as
*NL*
pleasant
as
the
serenity
of
Nature
could
make
it
;
but
when
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
ceased
speaking
,
it
was
altogether
a
silent
drive
to
those
within
.
Their
*NL*
spirits
were
in
general
exhausted
;
and
to
determine
whether
the
day
had
*NL*
afforded
most
pleasure
or
pain
,
might
occupy
the
meditations
of
almost
*NL*
all
.

CHAPTER
XI
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
at
Sotherton
,
with
all
its
imperfections
,
afforded
the
Miss
*NL*
Bertrams
much
more
agreeable
feelings
than
were
derived
from
the
letters
*NL*
from
Antigua
,
which
soon
afterwards
reached
Mansfield
.
It
was
much
*NL*
pleasanter
to
think
of
Henry
Crawford
than
of
their
father
;
and
to
think
*NL*
of
their
father
in
England
again
within
a
certain
period
,
which
these
*NL*
letters
obliged
them
to
do
,
was
a
most
unwelcome
exercise
.
*NL*
*NL*
November
was
the
black
month
fixed
for
his
return
.
Sir
Thomas
wrote
of
*NL*
it
with
as
much
decision
as
experience
and
anxiety
could
authorise
.
His
*NL*
business
was
so
nearly
concluded
as
to
justify
him
in
proposing
to
take
*NL*
his
passage
in
the
September
packet
,
and
he
consequently
looked
forward
*NL*
with
the
hope
of
being
with
his
beloved
family
again
early
in
November
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
was
more
to
be
pitied
than
Julia
;
for
to
her
the
father
brought
a
*NL*
husband
,
and
the
return
of
the
friend
most
solicitous
for
her
happiness
*NL*
would
unite
her
to
the
lover
,
on
whom
she
had
chosen
that
happiness
*NL*
should
depend
.
It
was
a
gloomy
prospect
,
and
all
she
could
do
was
to
*NL*
throw
a
mist
over
it
,
and
hope
when
the
mist
cleared
away
she
should
*NL*
see
something
else
.
It
would
hardly
be
_
early
_
in
November
,
there
*NL*
were
generally
delays
,
a
bad
passage
or
_
something
_
;
that
favouring
*NL*
_
something
_
which
everybody
who
shuts
their
eyes
while
they
look
,
or
*NL*
their
understandings
while
they
reason
,
feels
the
comfort
of
.
It
would
*NL*
probably
be
the
middle
of
November
at
least
;
the
middle
of
November
*NL*
was
three
months
off
.
Three
months
comprised
thirteen
weeks
.
Much
might
*NL*
happen
in
thirteen
weeks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
would
have
been
deeply
mortified
by
a
suspicion
of
half
that
*NL*
his
daughters
felt
on
the
subject
of
his
return
,
and
would
hardly
have
*NL*
found
consolation
in
a
knowledge
of
the
interest
it
excited
in
the
*NL*
breast
of
another
young
lady
.
Miss
Crawford
,
on
walking
up
with
her
*NL*
brother
to
spend
the
evening
at
Mansfield
Park
,
heard
the
good
news
;
and
*NL*
though
seeming
to
have
no
concern
in
the
affair
beyond
politeness
,
and
*NL*
to
have
vented
all
her
feelings
in
a
quiet
congratulation
,
heard
it
with
*NL*
an
attention
not
so
easily
satisfied
.
Mrs.
Norris
gave
the
particulars
*NL*
of
the
letters
,
and
the
subject
was
dropt
;
but
after
tea
,
as
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
was
standing
at
an
open
window
with
Edmund
and
Fanny
looking
*NL*
out
on
a
twilight
scene
,
while
the
Miss
Bertrams
,
Mr.
Rushworth
,
*NL*
and
Henry
Crawford
were
all
busy
with
candles
at
the
pianoforte
,
she
*NL*
suddenly
revived
it
by
turning
round
towards
the
group
,
and
saying
,
``
How
*NL*
happy
Mr.
Rushworth
looks
!
He
is
thinking
of
November
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
looked
round
at
Mr.
Rushworth
too
,
but
had
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
father
's
return
will
be
a
very
interesting
event

the
knowing

Nobody
wonders

Edmund

To

beg
some

of
a

as
heroism

all
against
him

*NL*
``
I
do
not
wonder

made
worse

faulty

self-indulgence

be
exceedingly
painful

``
No

we
need
not
give
up

profession
Dr.

chosen

he
would
have

taken
a

not
a
good
temper
into
it

as
he
must
,
either
in

have
had
a
great
many
more
people
under

I
think
more
would
have
been
made
unhappy
by
him
as
a
sailor

*NL*
soldier

as
a

Besides
,
I
can
not
but
suppose
that
whatever
*NL*
there
may
be
to
wish
otherwise
in
Dr.

would
have
been
in
a
greater
*NL*
danger

becoming
worse
in
a
more
active

worldly
profession

*NL*
he

Dr.

can
not

teaching
others
their
duty

every
week

can
not
go
to
church
twice
every
Sunday

preach
such
very
*NL*
good
sermons
in
so
good
a
manner
as
he
does
,
without
being
the
better
*NL*
for
it
himself

It
must
make
him
think
;
and
I
have
no
doubt
that
he
*NL*
oftener
endeavours
to
restrain
himself

he
would

tripped
off

ecstasy

agreed
to
it

had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
continue
at
the

window
with
her
,
in
spite
of
the
expected
glee
;

of
having
his

soon
turned

like
hers

towards
the
scene
without

where
all
that
was

solemn

soothing

lovely

in
the
brilliancy

an

unclouded
night

the
contrast

deep
shade

woods

Fanny

spoke
her
feelings

CHAPTER
XII
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
to
return
in
November
,
and
his
eldest
son
had
duties
to
*NL*
call
him
earlier
home
.
The
approach
of
September
brought
tidings
of
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
,
first
in
a
letter
to
the
gamekeeper
and
then
in
a
letter
*NL*
to
Edmund
;
and
by
the
end
of
August
he
arrived
himself
,
to
be
gay
,
*NL*
agreeable
,
and
gallant
again
as
occasion
served
,
or
Miss
Crawford
*NL*
demanded
;
to
tell
of
races
and
Weymouth
,
and
parties
and
friends
,
to
*NL*
which
she
might
have
listened
six
weeks
before
with
some
interest
,
and
*NL*
altogether
to
give
her
the
fullest
conviction
,
by
the
power
of
actual
*NL*
comparison
,
of
her
preferring
his
younger
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
vexatious
,
and
she
was
heartily
sorry
for
it
;
but
so
it
was
;
*NL*
and
so
far
from
now
meaning
to
marry
the
elder
,
she
did
not
even
want
*NL*
to
attract
him
beyond
what
the
simplest
claims
of
conscious
beauty
*NL*
required
:
his
lengthened
absence
from
Mansfield
,
without
anything
but
*NL*
pleasure
in
view
,
and
his
own
will
to
consult
,
made
it
perfectly
clear
*NL*
that
he
did
not
care
about
her
;
and
his
indifference
was
so
much
more
*NL*
than
equalled
by
her
own
,
that
were
he
now
to
step
forth
the
owner
of
*NL*
Mansfield
Park
,
the
Sir
Thomas
complete
,
which
he
was
to
be
in
time
,
she
*NL*
did
not
believe
she
could
accept
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
season
and
duties
which
brought
Mr.
Bertram
back
to
Mansfield
took
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
into
Norfolk
.
Everingham
could
not
do
without
him
in
the
*NL*
beginning
of
September
.
He
went
for
a
fortnight
--
a
fortnight
of
such
*NL*
dullness
to
the
Miss
Bertrams
as
ought
to
have
put
them
both
on
their
*NL*
guard
,
and
made
even
Julia
admit
,
in
her
jealousy
of
her
sister
,
the
*NL*
absolute
necessity
of
distrusting
his
attentions
,
and
wishing
him
not
*NL*
to
return
;
and
a
fortnight
of
sufficient
leisure
,
in
the
intervals
of
*NL*
shooting
and
sleeping
,
to
have
convinced
the
gentleman
that
he
ought
*NL*
to
keep
longer
away
,
had
he
been
more
in
the
habit
of
examining
his
own
*NL*
motives
,
and
of
reflecting
to
what
the
indulgence
of
his
idle
vanity
was
*NL*
tending
;
but
,
thoughtless
and
selfish
from
prosperity
and
bad
example
,
*NL*
he
would
not
look
beyond
the
present
moment
.
The
sisters
,
handsome
,
*NL*
clever
,
and
encouraging
,
were
an
amusement
to
his
sated
mind
;
and
*NL*
finding
nothing
in
Norfolk
to
equal
the
social
pleasures
of
Mansfield
,
*NL*
he
gladly
returned
to
it
at
the
time
appointed
,
and
was
welcomed
thither
*NL*
quite
as
gladly
by
those
whom
he
came
to
trifle
with
further
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
,
with
only
Mr.
Rushworth
to
attend
to
her
,
and
doomed
to
the
*NL*
repeated
details
of
his
day
's
sport
,
good
or
bad
,
his
boast
of
his
dogs
,
*NL*
his
jealousy
of
his
neighbours
,
his
doubts
of
their
qualifications
,
*NL*
and
his
zeal
after
poachers
,
subjects
which
will
not
find
their
way
to
*NL*
female
feelings
without
some
talent
on
one
side
or
some
attachment
on
*NL*
the
other
,
had
missed
Mr.
Crawford
grievously
;
and
Julia
,
unengaged
and
*NL*
unemployed
,
felt
all
the
right
of
missing
him
much
more
.
Each
sister
*NL*
believed
herself
the
favourite
.
Julia
might
be
justified
in
so
doing
by
*NL*
the
hints
of
Mrs.
Grant
,
inclined
to
credit
what
she
wished
,
and
Maria
*NL*
by
the
hints
of
Mr.
Crawford
himself
.
Everything
returned
into
the
same
*NL*
channel
as
before
his
absence
;
his
manners
being
to
each
so
animated
and
*NL*
agreeable
as
to
lose
no
ground
with
either
,
and
just
stopping
short
of
*NL*
the
consistence
,
the
steadiness
,
the
solicitude
,
and
the
warmth
which
*NL*
might
excite
general
notice
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
the
only
one
of
the
party
who
found
anything
to
dislike
;
but
*NL*
since
the
day
at
Sotherton
,
she
could
never
see
Mr.
Crawford
with
either
*NL*
sister
without
observation
,
and
seldom
without
wonder
or
censure
;
and
*NL*
had
her
confidence
in
her
own
judgment
been
equal
to
her
exercise
of
it
*NL*
in
every
other
respect
,
had
she
been
sure
that
she
was
seeing
clearly
,
*NL*
and
judging
candidly
,
she
would
probably
have
made
some
important
*NL*
communications
to
her
usual
confidant
.
As
it
was
,
however
,
she
only
*NL*
hazarded
a
hint
,
and
the
hint
was
lost
.
``
I
am
rather
surprised
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
that
Mr.
Crawford
should
come
back
again
so
soon
,
after
being
here
*NL*
so
long
before
,
full
seven
weeks
;
for
I
had
understood
he
was
so
*NL*
very
fond
of
change
and
moving
about
,
that
I
thought
something
would
*NL*
certainly
occur
,
when
he
was
once
gone
,
to
take
him
elsewhere
.
He
is
*NL*
used
to
much
gayer
places
than
Mansfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
to
his
credit
,
''
was
Edmund
's
answer
;
``
and
I
dare
say
it
gives
his
*NL*
sister
pleasure
.
She
does
not
like
his
unsettled
habits
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
a
favourite
he
is
with
my
cousins
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
his
manners
to
women
are
such
as
must
please
.
Mrs.
Grant
,
I
*NL*
believe
,
suspects
him
of
a
preference
for
Julia
;
I
have
never
seen
much
*NL*
symptom
of
it
,
but
I
wish
it
may
be
so
.
He
has
no
faults
but
what
a
*NL*
serious
attachment
would
remove
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
Miss
Bertram
were
not
engaged
,
''
said
Fanny
cautiously
,
``
I
could
*NL*
sometimes
almost
think
that
he
admired
her
more
than
Julia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Which
is
,
perhaps
,
more
in
favour
of
his
liking
Julia
best
,
than
you
,
*NL*
Fanny
,
may
be
aware
;
for
I
believe
it
often
happens
that
a
man
,
before
*NL*
he
has
quite
made
up
his
own
mind
,
will
distinguish
the
sister
or
*NL*
intimate
friend
of
the
woman
he
is
really
thinking
of
more
than
the
*NL*
woman
herself
.
Crawford
has
too
much
sense
to
stay
here
if
he
found
*NL*
himself
in
any
danger
from
Maria
;
and
I
am
not
at
all
afraid
for
her
,
*NL*
after
such
a
proof
as
she
has
given
that
her
feelings
are
not
strong
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
supposed
she
must
have
been
mistaken
,
and
meant
to
think
*NL*
differently
in
future
;
but
with
all
that
submission
to
Edmund
could
*NL*
do
,
and
all
the
help
of
the
coinciding
looks
and
hints
which
she
*NL*
occasionally
noticed
in
some
of
the
others
,
and
which
seemed
to
say
that
*NL*
Julia
was
Mr.
Crawford
's
choice
,
she
knew
not
always
what
to
think
.
She
*NL*
was
privy
,
one
evening
,
to
the
hopes
of
her
aunt
Norris
on
the
subject
,
*NL*
as
well
as
to
her
feelings
,
and
the
feelings
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
on
a
*NL*
point
of
some
similarity
,
and
could
not
help
wondering
as
she
listened
;
*NL*
and
glad
would
she
have
been
not
to
be
obliged
to
listen
,
for
it
was
*NL*
while
all
the
other
young
people
were
dancing
,
and
she
sitting
,
*NL*
most
unwillingly
,
among
the
chaperons
at
the
fire
,
longing
for
the
*NL*
re-entrance
of
her
elder
cousin
,
on
whom
all
her
own
hopes
of
a
partner
*NL*
then
depended
.
It
was
Fanny
's
first
ball
,
though
without
the
preparation
*NL*
or
splendour
of
many
a
young
lady
's
first
ball
,
being
the
thought
only
*NL*
of
the
afternoon
,
built
on
the
late
acquisition
of
a
violin
player
in
*NL*
the
servants
'
hall
,
and
the
possibility
of
raising
five
couple
with
*NL*
the
help
of
Mrs.
Grant
and
a
new
intimate
friend
of
Mr.
Bertram
's
just
*NL*
arrived
on
a
visit
.
It
had
,
however
,
been
a
very
happy
one
to
Fanny
*NL*
through
four
dances
,
and
she
was
quite
grieved
to
be
losing
even
a
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
.
While
waiting
and
wishing
,
looking
now
at
*NL*
the
dancers
and
now
at
the
door
,
this
dialogue
between
the
two
*NL*
above-mentioned
ladies
was
forced
on
her
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
think
,
ma'am
,
''
said
Mrs.
Norris
,
her
eyes
directed
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
and
Maria
,
who
were
partners
for
the
second
time
,
``
we
shall
*NL*
see
some
happy
faces
again
now
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
indeed
,
''
replied
the
other
,
with
a
stately
simper
,
``
there
*NL*
will
be
some
satisfaction
in
looking
on
_
now
_
,
and
I
think
it
was
rather
*NL*
a
pity
they
should
have
been
obliged
to
part
.
Young
folks
in
their
*NL*
situation
should
be
excused
complying
with
the
common
forms
.
I
wonder
my
*NL*
son
did
not
propose
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
he
did
,
ma'am
.
Mr.
Rushworth
is
never
remiss
.
But
dear
Maria
*NL*
has
such
a
strict
sense
of
propriety
,
so
much
of
that
true
delicacy
*NL*
which
one
seldom
meets
with
nowadays
,
Mrs.
Rushworth
--
that
wish
of
*NL*
avoiding
particularity
!
Dear
ma'am
,
only
look
at
her
face
at
this
*NL*
moment
;
how
different
from
what
it
was
the
two
last
dances
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Bertram
did
indeed
look
happy
,
her
eyes
were
sparkling
with
*NL*
pleasure
,
and
she
was
speaking
with
great
animation
,
for
Julia
and
her
*NL*
partner
,
Mr.
Crawford
,
were
close
to
her
;
they
were
all
in
a
cluster
*NL*
together
.
How
she
had
looked
before
,
Fanny
could
not
recollect
,
for
she
*NL*
had
been
dancing
with
Edmund
herself
,
and
had
not
thought
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
continued
,
``
It
is
quite
delightful
,
ma'am
,
to
see
young
*NL*
people
so
properly
happy
,
so
well
suited
,
and
so
much
the
thing
!
I
*NL*
can
not
but
think
of
dear
Sir
Thomas
's
delight
.
And
what
do
you
say
,
*NL*
ma'am
,
to
the
chance
of
another
match
?
Mr.
Rushworth
has
set
a
good
*NL*
example
,
and
such
things
are
very
catching
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
who
saw
nothing
but
her
son
,
was
quite
at
a
loss
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
couple
above
,
ma'am
.
Do
you
see
no
symptoms
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
!
Miss
Julia
and
Mr.
Crawford
.
Yes
,
indeed
,
a
very
pretty
match
.
*NL*
What
is
his
property
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Four
thousand
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
.
Those
who
have
not
more
must
be
satisfied
with
what
they
*NL*
have
.
Four
thousand
a
year
is
a
pretty
estate
,
and
he
seems
a
very
*NL*
genteel
,
steady
young
man
,
so
I
hope
Miss
Julia
will
be
very
happy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
a
settled
thing
,
ma'am
,
yet
.
We
only
speak
of
it
among
*NL*
friends
.
But
I
have
very
little
doubt
it
_
will
_
be
.
He
is
growing
*NL*
extremely
particular
in
his
attentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
listen
no
farther
.
Listening
and
wondering
were
all
*NL*
suspended
for
a
time
,
for
Mr.
Bertram
was
in
the
room
again
;
and
though
*NL*
feeling
it
would
be
a
great
honour
to
be
asked
by
him
,
she
thought
it
*NL*
must
happen
.
He
came
towards
their
little
circle
;
but
instead
of
asking
*NL*
her
to
dance
,
drew
a
chair
near
her
,
and
gave
her
an
account
of
the
*NL*
present
state
of
a
sick
horse
,
and
the
opinion
of
the
groom
,
from
*NL*
whom
he
had
just
parted
.
Fanny
found
that
it
was
not
to
be
,
and
in
the
*NL*
modesty
of
her
nature
immediately
felt
that
she
had
been
unreasonable
*NL*
in
expecting
it
.
When
he
had
told
of
his
horse
,
he
took
a
newspaper
from
*NL*
the
table
,
and
looking
over
it
,
said
in
a
languid
way
,
``
If
you
want
to
*NL*
dance
,
Fanny
,
I
will
stand
up
with
you
.
''
With
more
than
equal
civility
*NL*
the
offer
was
declined
;
she
did
not
wish
to
dance
.
``
I
am
glad
of
it
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
in
a
much
brisker
tone
,
and
throwing
down
the
newspaper
again
,
*NL*
``
for
I
am
tired
to
death
.
I
only
wonder
how
the
good
people
can
keep
*NL*
it
up
so
long
.
They
had
need
be
_
all
_
in
love
,
to
find
any
amusement
in
*NL*
such
folly
;
and
so
they
are
,
I
fancy
.
If
you
look
at
them
you
may
see
*NL*
they
are
so
many
couple
of
lovers
--
all
but
Yates
and
Mrs.
Grant
--
and
,
*NL*
between
ourselves
,
she
,
poor
woman
,
must
want
a
lover
as
much
as
any
one
*NL*
of
them
.
A
desperate
dull
life
hers
must
be
with
the
doctor
,
''
making
*NL*
a
sly
face
as
he
spoke
towards
the
chair
of
the
latter
,
who
proving
,
*NL*
however
,
to
be
close
at
his
elbow
,
made
so
instantaneous
a
change
of
*NL*
expression
and
subject
necessary
,
as
Fanny
,
in
spite
of
everything
,
*NL*
could
hardly
help
laughing
at
.
``
A
strange
business
this
in
America
,
Dr.
*NL*
Grant
!
What
is
your
opinion
?
I
always
come
to
you
to
know
what
I
am
to
*NL*
think
of
public
matters
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Tom
,
''
cried
his
aunt
soon
afterwards
,
``
as
you
are
not
dancing
,
*NL*
I
dare
say
you
will
have
no
objection
to
join
us
in
a
rubber
;
shall
*NL*
you
?
''
Then
leaving
her
seat
,
and
coming
to
him
to
enforce
the
proposal
,
*NL*
added
in
a
whisper
,
``
We
want
to
make
a
table
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
you
*NL*
know
.
Your
mother
is
quite
anxious
about
it
,
but
can
not
very
well
spare
*NL*
time
to
sit
down
herself
,
because
of
her
fringe
.
Now
,
you

I

just
do

play

half-crowns

you
*NL*
may
bet
half-guineas
with

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
most
happy

''
replied
he
aloud
,
and
jumping
up
with
*NL*
alacrity
,
``
it
would
give
me
the
greatest
pleasure
;
but
that
I
am
*NL*
this
moment
going
to
dance

Come

Fanny
,
taking
her
hand
,
``
do
not
be
*NL*
dawdling
any
longer
,
or
the
dance
will
be
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
led
off
very
willingly
,
though
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
*NL*
feel
much
gratitude
towards
her
cousin
,
or
distinguish
,
as
he
certainly
*NL*
did
,
between
the
selfishness
of
another
person
and
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
pretty
modest
request
upon
my
word
,
''
he
indignantly
exclaimed
as
they
*NL*
walked
away
.
``
To
want
to
nail
me
to
a
card-table
for
the
next
two
hours
*NL*
with
herself
and
Dr.
Grant
,
who
are
always
quarrelling
,
and
that
poking
*NL*
old
woman
,
who
knows
no
more
of
whist
than
of
algebra
.
I
wish
my
good
*NL*
aunt
would
be
a
little
less
busy
!
And
to
ask
me
in
such
a
way
too

*NL*
without
ceremony
,
before
them
all

so
as
to
leave
me
no
possibility
*NL*
of
refusing
.
_
That
_
is
what
I
dislike
most
particularly
.
It
raises
my
*NL*
spleen
more
than
anything
,
to
have
the
pretence
of
being
asked
,
of
*NL*
being
given
a
choice
,
and
at
the
same
time
addressed
in
such
a
way
as
*NL*
to
oblige
one
to
do
the
very
thing

whatever
it
be
!
If
I
had
not
luckily
*NL*
thought
of
standing
up
with
you
I
could
not
have
got
out
of
it

It
is
*NL*
a
great
deal
too
bad

got
a
fancy

CHAPTER
XIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Honourable
John
Yates
,
this
new
friend
,
had
not
much
to
recommend
*NL*
him
beyond
habits
of
fashion
and
expense
,
and
being
the
younger
son
of
*NL*
a
lord
with
a
tolerable
independence
;
and
Sir
Thomas
would
probably
*NL*
have
thought
his
introduction
at
Mansfield
by
no
means
desirable
.
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
's
acquaintance
with
him
had
begun
at
Weymouth
,
where
they
had
*NL*
spent
ten
days
together
in
the
same
society
,
and
the
friendship
,
if
*NL*
friendship
it
might
be
called
,
had
been
proved
and
perfected
by
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
's
being
invited
to
take
Mansfield
in
his
way
,
whenever
he
could
,
*NL*
and
by
his
promising
to
come
;
and
he
did
come
rather
earlier
than
had
*NL*
been
expected
,
in
consequence
of
the
sudden
breaking-up
of
a
large
party
*NL*
assembled
for
gaiety
at
the
house
of
another
friend
,
which
he
had
left
*NL*
Weymouth
to
join
.
He
came
on
the
wings
of
disappointment
,
and
with
his
*NL*
head
full
of
acting
,
for
it
had
been
a
theatrical
party
;
and
the
play
*NL*
in
which
he
had
borne
a
part
was
within
two
days
of
representation
,
*NL*
when
the
sudden
death
of
one
of
the
nearest
connexions
of
the
family
*NL*
had
destroyed
the
scheme
and
dispersed
the
performers
.
To
be
so
near
*NL*
happiness
,
so
near
fame
,
so
near
the
long
paragraph
in
praise
of
the
*NL*
private
theatricals
at
Ecclesford
,
the
seat
of
the
Right
Hon.
Lord
*NL*
Ravenshaw
,
in
Cornwall
,
which
would
of
course
have
immortalised
the
*NL*
whole
party
for
at
least
a
twelvemonth
!
and
being
so
near
,
to
lose
*NL*
it
all
,
was
an
injury
to
be
keenly
felt
,
and
Mr.
Yates
could
talk
of
*NL*
nothing
else
.
Ecclesford
and
its
theatre
,
with
its
arrangements
and
*NL*
dresses
,
rehearsals
and
jokes
,
was
his
never-failing
subject
,
and
to
*NL*
boast
of
the
past
his
only
consolation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
him
,
a
love
of
the
theatre
is
so
general
,
an
itch
for
acting
*NL*
so
strong
among
young
people
,
that
he
could
hardly
out-talk
the
interest
*NL*
of
his
hearers
.
From
the
first
casting
of
the
parts
to
the
epilogue
it
*NL*
was
all
bewitching
,
and
there
were
few
who
did
not
wish
to
have
been
a
*NL*
party
concerned
,
or
would
have
hesitated
to
try
their
skill
.
The
play
*NL*
had
been
Lovers
'
Vows
,
and
Mr.
Yates
was
to
have
been
Count
Cassel
.
``
A
*NL*
trifling
part
,
''
said
he
,
``
and
not
at
all
to
my
taste
,
and
such
a
one
*NL*
as
I
certainly
would
not
accept
again
;
but
I
was
determined
to
make
no
*NL*
difficulties
.
Lord
Ravenshaw
and
the
duke
had
appropriated
the
only
two
*NL*
characters
worth
playing
before
I
reached
Ecclesford
;
and
though
Lord
*NL*
Ravenshaw
offered
to
resign
his
to
me
,
it
was
impossible
to
take
it
,
you
*NL*
know
.
I
was
sorry
for
_
him
_
that
he
should
have
so
mistaken
his
powers
,
*NL*
for
he
was
no
more
equal
to
the
Baron
--
a
little
man
with
a
weak
voice
,
*NL*
always
hoarse
after
the
first
ten
minutes
.
It
must
have
injured
the
*NL*
piece
materially
;
but
_
I
_
was
resolved
to
make
no
difficulties
.
Sir
*NL*
Henry
thought
the
duke
not
equal
to
Frederick
,
but
that
was
because
*NL*
Sir
Henry
wanted
the
part
himself
;
whereas
it
was
certainly
in
the
best
*NL*
hands
of
the
two
.
I
was
surprised
to
see
Sir
Henry
such
a
stick
.
Luckily
*NL*
the
strength
of
the
piece
did
not
depend
upon
him
.
Our
Agatha
was
*NL*
inimitable
,
and
the
duke
was
thought
very
great
by
many
.
And
upon
the
*NL*
whole
,
it
would
certainly
have
gone
off
wonderfully
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
hard
case
,
upon
my
word
''
;
and
,
``
I
do
think
you
were
very
much
*NL*
to
be
pitied
,
''
were
the
kind
responses
of
listening
sympathy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
worth
complaining
about
;
but
to
be
sure
the
poor
old
dowager
*NL*
could
not
have
died
at
a
worse
time
;
and
it
is
impossible
to
help
*NL*
wishing
that
the
news
could
have
been
suppressed
for
just
the
three
days
*NL*
we
wanted
.
It
was
but
three
days
;
and
being
only
a
grandmother
,
and
all
*NL*
happening
two
hundred
miles
off
,
I
think
there
would
have
been
no
great
*NL*
harm
,
and
it
was
suggested
,
I
know
;
but
Lord
Ravenshaw
,
who
I
suppose
is
*NL*
one
of
the
most
correct
men
in
England
,
would
not
hear
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
An
afterpiece
instead
of
a
comedy
,
''
said
Mr.
Bertram
.
``
Lovers
'
Vows
*NL*
were
at
an
end
,
and
Lord
and
Lady
Ravenshaw
left
to
act
My
Grandmother
*NL*
by
themselves
.
Well
,
the
jointure
may
comfort
_
him
_
;
and
perhaps
,
*NL*
between
friends
,
he
began
to
tremble
for
his
credit
and
his
lungs
in
the
*NL*
Baron
,
and
was
not
sorry
to
withdraw
;
and
to
make
_
you
_
amends
,
Yates
,
I
*NL*
think
we
must
raise
a
little
theatre
at
Mansfield
,
and
ask
you
to
be
our
*NL*
manager
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
,
though
the
thought
of
the
moment
,
did
not
end
with
the
moment
;
for
*NL*
the
inclination
to
act
was
awakened
,
and
in
no
one
more
strongly
than
in
*NL*
him
who
was
now
master
of
the
house
;
and
who
,
having
so
much
leisure
as
*NL*
to
make
almost
any
novelty
a
certain
good
,
had
likewise
such
a
degree
of
*NL*
lively
talents
and
comic
taste
,
as
were
exactly
adapted
to
the
novelty
*NL*
of
acting
.
The
thought
returned
again
and
again
.
``
Oh
for
the
Ecclesford
*NL*
theatre
and
scenery
to
try
something
with
.
''
Each
sister
could
echo
the
*NL*
wish
;
and
Henry
Crawford
,
to
whom
,
in
all
the
riot
of
his
gratifications
*NL*
it
was
yet
an
untasted
pleasure
,
was
quite
alive
at
the
idea
.
``
I
really
*NL*
believe
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
could
be
fool
enough
at
this
moment
to
undertake
*NL*
any
character
that
ever
was
written
,
from
Shylock
or
Richard
III
down
to
*NL*
the
singing
hero
of
a
farce
in
his
scarlet
coat
and
cocked
hat
.
I
feel
*NL*
as
if
I
could
be
anything
or
everything
;
as
if
I
could
rant
and
storm

be
doing
something

it
only
half
a
play

an
act

a
scene

should
prevent
us

Not
these
countenances

I
am
sure

looking
towards
*NL*
the
Miss
Bertrams
;
``

for

what
signifies
a
theatre

shall
be
only
amusing

this
house

suffice

*NL*
*NL*
``
We
must
have
a
curtain

said
Tom
Bertram
;
``
a
few
yards
of
green
baize
*NL*
for
a
curtain
,

perhaps
that
may
be
enough

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

quite
enough

cried
Mr.
Yates
,
``
with
only
just
a
side
wing

two

run
up

doors
in

three

four

to
be
let
down
;
nothing

more
would
be
necessary
on
such
a

this

Maria

There
would

not
be
time

rather
adopt

's
views
,
and
make
the

performance
_
,
not
the
_
theatre

our

object

Many
parts

*NL*
``

Edmund

who
began
to
listen
with
alarm

good

,
and
a

,
and

and
a

song
between

If

do
not
outdo

we
do
nothing

*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Edmund
,
do
not
be
disagreeable

said
Julia
.
``
Nobody
loves

*NL*

``
True

good

real

I
would
hardly
*NL*
walk
from
this
room
to
the
next
to
look
at
the
raw
efforts
of
those
who
*NL*
have
not
been
bred
to
the
trade
:
a
set
of
gentlemen

ladies

who
have
*NL*
all
the
disadvantages
of
education
and
decorum
to
struggle
through

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
pause
,
however
,
the
subject
still
continued
,
and
was
*NL*
discussed
with
unabated
eagerness
,
every
one
's
inclination
increasing
*NL*
by
the
discussion
,
and
a
knowledge
of
the
inclination
of
the
rest
;
and
*NL*
though
nothing
was
settled
but
that
Tom
Bertram
would
prefer
a
comedy
,
*NL*
and
his
sisters
and
Henry
Crawford
a
tragedy
,
and
that
nothing
in
the
*NL*
world
could
be
easier
than
to
find
a
piece
which
would
please
them
all
,
*NL*
the
resolution
to
act
something
or
other
seemed
so
decided
as
to
*NL*
make
Edmund
quite
uncomfortable
.
He
was
determined
to
prevent
it
,
if
*NL*
possible
,
though
his
mother
,
who
equally
heard
the
conversation
which
*NL*
passed
at
table
,
did
not
evince
the
least
disapprobation
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
same
evening
afforded
him
an
opportunity
of
trying
his
strength
.
*NL*
Maria
,
Julia
,
Henry
Crawford
,
and
Mr.
Yates
were
in
the
billiard-room

*NL*
Tom
,
returning
from
them
into
the
drawing-room
,
where
Edmund
was
*NL*
standing
thoughtfully
by
the
fire
,
while
Lady
Bertram
was
on
the
sofa
at
*NL*
a
little
distance
,
and
Fanny
close
beside
her
arranging
her
work
,
thus
*NL*
began
as
he
entered
--
``
Such
a
horribly
vile
billiard-table
as
ours
is
not
*NL*
to
be
met
with
,
I
believe
,
above
ground
.
I
can
stand
it
no
longer
,
and
I
*NL*
think
,
I
may
say
,
that
nothing
shall
ever
tempt
me
to
it
again
;
but
one
*NL*
good
thing
I
have
just
ascertained
:
it
is
the
very
room
for
a
theatre
,
*NL*
precisely
the
shape
and
length
for
it
;
and
the
doors
at
the
farther
*NL*
end
,
communicating
with
each
other
,
as
they
may
be
made
to
do
in
five
*NL*
minutes
,
by
merely
moving
the
bookcase
in
my
father
's
room
,
is
the
very
*NL*
thing
we
could
have
desired
,
if
we
had
sat
down
to
wish
for
it
;
and
*NL*
my
father
's
room
will
be
an
excellent
greenroom
.
It
seems
to
join
the
*NL*
billiard-room
on
purpose
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
serious
,
Tom
,
in
meaning
to
act
?

said
Edmund
,
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
,
as
his
brother
approached
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
serious

never
more
so

is
there
to

you

*NL*

``
I
think
it
would
be
very
wrong

In

private

theatricals
are
open
to
some
objections
,
but
as
_
we
_
are
circumstanced

*NL*
I
must
think
it
would
be
highly
injudicious

more
than
injudicious
*NL*
to
attempt
anything
of
the
kind

It
would
shew
great
want

on

account

absent
as
he
is

in
some
degree

it
would
be
imprudent

I
think

with

*NL*
times
a
week
till
my
father
's
return
,
and
invite
all
the
country
.
But
*NL*
it
is
not
to
be
a
display
of
that
sort
.
We
mean
nothing
but
a
little
*NL*
amusement
among
ourselves
,
just
to
vary
the
scene
,
and
exercise
our
*NL*
powers
in
something
new
.
We
want
no
audience
,
no
publicity
.
We
may
be
*NL*
trusted
,
I
think
,
in
chusing
some
play
most
perfectly
unexceptionable
;
*NL*
and
I
can
conceive
no
greater
harm
or
danger
to
any
of
us
in
conversing
*NL*
in
the
elegant
written
language
of
some
respectable
author
than
in
*NL*
chattering
in
words
of
our
own
.
I
have
no
fears
and
no
scruples
.
And
*NL*
as
to
my
father
's
being
absent
,
it
is
so
far
from
an
objection
,
that
I
*NL*
consider
it
rather
as
a
motive
;
for
the
expectation
of
his
return
must
*NL*
be
a
very
anxious
period
to
my
mother
;
and
if
we
can
be
the
means
of
*NL*
amusing
that
anxiety
,
and
keeping
up
her
spirits
for
the
next
few
weeks
,
*NL*
I
shall
think
our
time
very
well
spent
,
and
so
,
I
am
sure
,
will
he
.
It
*NL*
is
a
_
very
_
anxious
period
for
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
said
this
,
each
looked
towards
their
mother
.
Lady
Bertram
,
sunk
*NL*
back
in
one
corner
of
the
sofa
,
the
picture
of
health
,
wealth
,
ease
,
*NL*
and
tranquillity
,
was
just
falling
into
a
gentle
doze
,
while
Fanny
was
*NL*
getting
through
the
few
difficulties
of
her
work
for
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
smiled
and
shook
his
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
By
Jove
!
this
wo
n't
do
,
''
cried
Tom
,
throwing
himself
into
a
chair
with
*NL*
a
hearty
laugh
.
``
To
be
sure
,
my
dear
mother
,
your
anxiety
--
I
was
unlucky
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
is
the
matter
?
''
asked
her
ladyship
,
in
the
heavy
tone
of
one
*NL*
half-roused
;
``
I
was
not
asleep
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
no
,
ma'am
,
nobody
suspected
you
!
Well
,
Edmund
,
''
he
continued
,
*NL*
returning
to
the
former
subject
,
posture
,
and
voice
,
as
soon
as
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
began
to
nod
again
,
``
but
_
this
_
I
_
will
_
maintain
,
that
we
shall
*NL*
be
doing
no
harm
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
agree
with
you
;
I
am
convinced
that
my
father
would
totally
*NL*
disapprove
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
am
convinced
to
the
contrary
.
Nobody
is
fonder
of
the
exercise
*NL*
of
talent
in
young
people
,
or
promotes
it
more
,
than
my
father
,
and
for
*NL*
anything
of
the
acting
,
spouting
,
reciting
kind
,
I
think
he
has
always
a
*NL*
decided
taste
.
I
am
sure
he
encouraged
it
in
us
as
boys
.
How
many
a
time
*NL*
have
we
mourned
over
the
dead
body
of
Julius
Caesar
,
and
to
_
be
'd
_
and
*NL*
not
_
to
_
_
be
'd
_
,
in
this
very
room
,
for
his
amusement
?
And
I
am
sure
,
*NL*
_
my
_
_
name
_
_
was
_
_
Norval
_
,
every
evening
of
my
life
through
one
*NL*
Christmas
holidays
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
a
very
different
thing
.
You
must
see
the
difference
yourself
.
My
*NL*
father
wished
us
,
as
schoolboys
,
to
speak
well
,
but
he
would
never
*NL*
wish
his
grown-up
daughters
to
be
acting
plays
.
His
sense
of
decorum
is
*NL*
strict
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
all
that
,
''
said
Tom
,
displeased
.
``
I
know
my
father
as
well
as
*NL*
you
do
;
and
I
'll
take
care
that
his
daughters
do
nothing
to
distress
*NL*
him
.
Manage
your
own
concerns
,
Edmund
,
and
I
'll
take
care
of
the
rest
of
*NL*
the
family
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
resolved
on
acting
,
''
replied
the
persevering
Edmund
,
``
I
must
*NL*
hope
it
will
be
in
a
very
small
and
quiet
way
;
and
I
think
a
theatre
*NL*
ought
not
to
be
attempted
.
It
would
be
taking
liberties
with
my
father
's
*NL*
house
in
his
absence
which
could
not
be
justified
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
everything
of
that
nature
I
will
be
answerable
,
''
said
Tom
,
in
a
*NL*
decided
tone
.
``
His
house
shall
not
be
hurt

I
have
quite
as
great
an
*NL*
interest
in
being
careful
of
his
house
as
you
can
have
;
and
as
to
such
*NL*
alterations
as
I
was
suggesting
just
now
,
such
as
moving
a
bookcase
,
or
*NL*
unlocking
a
door
,
or
even
as
using
the
billiard-room
for
the
space
of
a
*NL*
week
without
playing
at
billiards
in
it
,
you
might
just
as
well
suppose
*NL*
he
would
object
to
our
sitting
more
in
this
room
,
and
less
in
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
,
than
we
did
before
he
went
away
,
or
to
my
sister
's
*NL*
pianoforte
being
moved
from
one
side
of
the
room
to
the
other
.
Absolute
*NL*
nonsense
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
innovation
,
if
not
wrong
as
an
innovation
,
will
be
wrong
as
an
*NL*
expense
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
the
expense
of
such
an
undertaking
would
be
prodigious
!
Perhaps
*NL*
it
might
cost
a
whole
twenty
pounds
.
Something
of
a
theatre
we
must
have
*NL*
undoubtedly
,
but
it
will
be
on
the
simplest
plan
:
a
green
curtain
and
a
*NL*
little
carpenter
's
work
,
and
that
's
all
;
and
as
the
carpenter
's
work
*NL*
may
be
all
done
at
home
by
Christopher
Jackson
himself
,
it
will
be
*NL*
too
absurd
to
talk
of
expense
;
and
as
long
as
Jackson
is
employed
,
*NL*
everything
will
be
right
with
Sir
Thomas
.
Do
n't
imagine
that
nobody
in
*NL*
this
house
can
see
or
judge
but
yourself
.
Do
n't
act
yourself
,
if
you
do
*NL*
not
like
it
,
but
do
n't
expect
to
govern
everybody
else

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
as
to
acting
myself
,
''
said
Edmund
,
''
_
that
_
I
absolutely
protest
*NL*
against
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
walked
out
of
the
room
as
he
said
it
,
and
Edmund
was
left
to
sit
*NL*
down
and
stir
the
fire
in
thoughtful
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
who
had
heard
it
all
,
and
borne
Edmund
company
in
every
feeling
*NL*
throughout
the
whole
,
now
ventured
to
say
,
in
her
anxiety
to
suggest
*NL*
some
comfort
,
``
Perhaps
they
may
not
be
able
to
find
any
play
to
suit
*NL*
them

Your

taste

your

seem
very
different

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
no
hope
there
,
Fanny

If
they
persist
in
the
scheme

they
will
*NL*
find
something

I
shall
speak
to
my

dissuade

that
is
all
I
can
do

*NL*
``
I
dare
say
she
would

but
she
has
no

of
any

if
I
can
not
convince

*NL*
I
shall
let
things
take
their
course
,
without
attempting
it
through

her

Family
squabbling
is
the
greatest
evil
of
all
,
and
we
had
better
do
*NL*
anything
than
be
altogether
by
the
ears

''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sisters
,
to
whom
he
had
an
opportunity
of
speaking
the
next
morning
,
*NL*
were
quite
as
impatient
of
his
advice
,
quite
as
unyielding
to
his
*NL*
representation
,
quite
as
determined
in
the
cause
of
pleasure
,
as
Tom
.
*NL*
Their
mother
had
no
objection
to
the
plan
,
and
they
were
not
in
the
*NL*
least
afraid
of
their
father
's
disapprobation
.
There
could
be
no
harm
in
*NL*
what
had
been
done
in
so
many
respectable
families
,
and
by
so
many
women
*NL*
of
the
first
consideration
;
and
it
must
be
scrupulousness
run
mad
that
*NL*
could
see
anything
to
censure
in
a
plan
like
theirs
,
comprehending
only
*NL*
brothers
and
sisters
and
intimate
friends
,
and
which
would
never
be
*NL*
heard
of
beyond
themselves
.
Julia
_
did
_
seem
inclined
to
admit
that
*NL*
Maria
's
situation
might
require
particular
caution
and
delicacy
--
but
*NL*
that
could
not
extend
to
_
her
_
--
she
was
at
liberty
;
and
Maria
evidently
*NL*
considered
her
engagement
as
only
raising
her
so
much
more
above
*NL*
restraint
,
and
leaving
her
less
occasion
than
Julia
to
consult
either
*NL*
father
or
mother
.
Edmund
had
little
to
hope
,
but
he
was
still
urging
the
*NL*
subject
when
Henry
Crawford
entered
the
room
,
fresh
from
the
Parsonage
,
*NL*
calling
out
,
``
No
want
of
hands
in
our
theatre
,
Miss
Bertram
.
No
want
*NL*
of
understrappers
:
my
sister
desires
her
love
,
and
hopes
to
be
admitted
*NL*
into
the
company
,
and
will
be
happy
to
take
the
part
of
any
old
duenna
*NL*
or
tame
confidante
,
that
you
may
not
like
to
do
yourselves
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
gave
Edmund
a
glance
,
which
meant
,
``
What
say
you
now
?
Can
we
*NL*
be
wrong
if
Mary
Crawford
feels
the
same
?
''
And
Edmund
,
silenced
,
*NL*
was
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
charm
of
acting
might
well
carry
*NL*
fascination
to
the
mind
of
genius
;
and
with
the
ingenuity
of
love
,
to
*NL*
dwell
more
on
the
obliging
,
accommodating
purport
of
the
message
than
on
*NL*
anything
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
scheme
advanced
.
Opposition
was
vain
;
and
as
to
Mrs.
Norris
,
he
*NL*
was
mistaken
in
supposing
she
would
wish
to
make
any
.
She
started
no
*NL*
difficulties
that
were
not
talked
down
in
five
minutes
by
her
eldest
*NL*
nephew
and
niece
,
who
were
all-powerful
with
her
;
and
as
the
whole
*NL*
arrangement
was
to
bring
very
little
expense
to
anybody
,
and
none
at
all
*NL*
to
herself
,
as
she
foresaw
in
it
all
the
comforts
of
hurry
,
bustle
,
*NL*
and
importance
,
and
derived
the
immediate
advantage
of
fancying
herself
*NL*
obliged
to
leave
her
own
house
,
where
she
had
been
living
a
month
at
*NL*
her
own
cost
,
and
take
up
her
abode
in
theirs
,
that
every
hour
might
be
*NL*
spent
in
their
service
,
she
was
,
in
fact
,
exceedingly
delighted
with
the
*NL*
project
.

CHAPTER
XIV
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
seemed
nearer
being
right
than
Edmund
had
supposed
.
The
business
*NL*
of
finding
a
play
that
would
suit
everybody
proved
to
be
no
trifle
;
and
*NL*
the
carpenter
had
received
his
orders
and
taken
his
measurements
,
had
*NL*
suggested
and
removed
at
least
two
sets
of
difficulties
,
and
having
made
*NL*
the
necessity
of
an
enlargement
of
plan
and
expense
fully
evident
,
was
*NL*
already
at
work
,
while
a
play
was
still
to
seek
.
Other
preparations
*NL*
were
also
in
hand
.
An
enormous
roll
of
green
baize
had
arrived
from
*NL*
Northampton
,
and
been
cut
out
by
Mrs.
Norris
-LRB-
with
a
saving
by
her
good
*NL*
management
of
full
three-quarters
of
a
yard
-RRB-
,
and
was
actually
forming
*NL*
into
a
curtain
by
the
housemaids
,
and
still
the
play
was
wanting
;
and
*NL*
as
two
or
three
days
passed
away
in
this
manner
,
Edmund
began
almost
to
*NL*
hope
that
none
might
ever
be
found
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
,
in
fact
,
so
many
things
to
be
attended
to
,
so
many
people
*NL*
to
be
pleased
,
so
many
best
characters
required
,
and
,
above
all
,
such
a
*NL*
need
that
the
play
should
be
at
once
both
tragedy
and
comedy
,
that
there
*NL*
did
seem
as
little
chance
of
a
decision
as
anything
pursued
by
youth
and
*NL*
zeal
could
hold
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
tragic
side
were
the
Miss
Bertrams
,
Henry
Crawford
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
;
on
the
comic
,
Tom
Bertram
,
not
_
quite
_
alone
,
because
it
was
*NL*
evident
that
Mary
Crawford
's
wishes
,
though
politely
kept
back
,
inclined
*NL*
the
same
way
:
but
his
determinateness
and
his
power
seemed
to
make
*NL*
allies
unnecessary
;
and
,
independent
of
this
great
irreconcilable
*NL*
difference
,
they
wanted
a
piece
containing
very
few
characters
in
the
*NL*
whole
,
but
every
character
first-rate
,
and
three
principal
women
.
All
*NL*
the
best
plays
were
run
over
in
vain
.
Neither
Hamlet
,
nor
Macbeth
,
nor
*NL*
Othello
,
nor
Douglas
,
nor
The
Gamester
,
presented
anything
that
could
*NL*
satisfy
even
the
tragedians
;
and
The
Rivals
,
The
School
for
Scandal
,
*NL*
Wheel
of
Fortune
,
Heir
at
Law
,
and
a
long
et
cetera
,
were
successively
*NL*
dismissed
with
yet
warmer
objections
.
No
piece
could
be
proposed
that
*NL*
did
not
supply
somebody
with
a
difficulty
,
and
on
one
side
or
the
other
*NL*
it
was
a
continual
repetition
of
,
``
Oh
no
,
_
that
_
will
never
do
!
Let
us
*NL*
have
no
ranting
tragedies
.
Too
many
characters
.
Not
a
tolerable
*NL*
woman
's
part
in
the
play
.
Anything
but
_
that
_
,
my
dear
Tom
.
It
would
be
*NL*
impossible
to
fill
it
up
.
One
could
not
expect
anybody
to
take
such
a
*NL*
part
.
Nothing
but
buffoonery
from
beginning
to
end
.
_
That
_
might
do
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
but
for
the
low
parts
.
If
I
_
must
_
give
my
opinion
,
I
have
*NL*
always
thought
it
the
most
insipid
play
in
the
English
language
.
_
I
_
do
*NL*
not
wish
to
make
objections
;
I
shall
be
happy
to
be
of
any
use
,
but
I
*NL*
think
we
could
not
chuse
worse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
looked
on
and
listened
,
not
unamused
to
observe
the
selfishness
*NL*
which
,
more
or
less
disguised
,
seemed
to
govern
them
all
,
and
wondering
*NL*
how
it
would
end
.
For
her
own
gratification
she
could
have
wished
that
*NL*
something
might
be
acted
,
for
she
had
never
seen
even
half
a
play
,
but
*NL*
everything
of
higher
consequence
was
against
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
will
never
do
,
''
said
Tom
Bertram
at
last
.
``
We
are
wasting
time
*NL*
most
abominably
.
Something
must
be
fixed
on
.
No
matter
what
,
so
that
*NL*
something
is
chosen
.
We
must
not
be
so
nice
.
A
few
characters
too
many
*NL*
must
not
frighten
us
.
We
must
_
double
_
them
.
We
must
descend
a
little
.
*NL*
If
a
part
is
insignificant
,
the
greater
our
credit
in
making
anything
of
*NL*
it
.
From
this
moment
I
make
no
difficulties
.
I
take
any
part
you
chuse
*NL*
to
give
me
,
so
as
it
be
comic
.
Let
it
but
be
comic
,
I
condition
for
*NL*
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
about
the
fifth
time
he
then
proposed
the
Heir
at
Law
,
doubting
only
*NL*
whether
to
prefer
Lord
Duberley
or
Dr.
Pangloss
for
himself
;
and
very
*NL*
earnestly
,
but
very
unsuccessfully
,
trying
to
persuade
the
others
that
*NL*
there
were
some
fine
tragic
parts
in
the
rest
of
the
dramatis
personae
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
pause
which
followed
this
fruitless
effort
was
ended
by
the
same
*NL*
speaker
,
who
,
taking
up
one
of
the
many
volumes
of
plays
that
lay
on
the
*NL*
table
,
and
turning
it
over
,
suddenly
exclaimed
--
``
Lovers
'
Vows
!
And
why
*NL*
should
not
Lovers
'
Vows
do
for
_
us
_
as
well
as
for
the
Ravenshaws
?
How
*NL*
came
it
never
to
be
thought
of
before
?
It
strikes
me
as
if
it
would
do
*NL*
exactly
.
What
say
you
all
?
Here
are
two
capital
tragic
parts
for
Yates
*NL*
and
Crawford
,
and
here
is
the
rhyming
Butler
for
me
,
if
nobody
else
*NL*
wants
it
;
a
trifling
part
,
but
the
sort
of
thing
I
should
not
dislike
,
*NL*
and
,
as
I
said
before
,
I
am
determined
to
take
anything
and
do
my
best
.
*NL*
And
as
for
the
rest
,
they
may
be
filled
up
by
anybody
.
It
is
only
Count
*NL*
Cassel
and
Anhalt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
suggestion
was
generally
welcome
.
Everybody
was
growing
weary
of
*NL*
indecision
,
and
the
first
idea
with
everybody
was
,
that
nothing
had
been
*NL*
proposed
before
so
likely
to
suit
them
all
.
Mr.
Yates
was
particularly
*NL*
pleased
:
he
had
been
sighing
and
longing
to
do
the
Baron
at
Ecclesford
,
*NL*
had
grudged
every
rant
of
Lord
Ravenshaw
's
,
and
been
forced
to
re-rant
*NL*
it
all
in
his
own
room
.
The
storm
through
Baron
Wildenheim
was
the
*NL*
height
of
his
theatrical
ambition
;
and
with
the
advantage
of
knowing
*NL*
half
the
scenes
by
heart
already
,
he
did
now
,
with
the
greatest
*NL*
alacrity
,
offer
his
services
for
the
part
.
To
do
him
justice
,
however
,
*NL*
he
did
not
resolve
to
appropriate
it
;
for
remembering
that
there
was
*NL*
some
very
good
ranting-ground
in
Frederick
,
he
professed
an
equal
*NL*
willingness
for
that
.
Henry
Crawford
was
ready
to
take
either
.
Whichever
*NL*
Mr.
Yates
did
not
chuse
would
perfectly
satisfy
him
,
and
a
short
parley
*NL*
of
compliment
ensued
.
Miss
Bertram
,
feeling
all
the
interest
of
an
*NL*
Agatha
in
the
question
,
took
on
her
to
decide
it
,
by
observing
to
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
that
this
was
a
point
in
which
height
and
figure
ought
to
*NL*
be
considered
,
and
that
_
his
_
being
the
tallest
,
seemed
to
fit
him
*NL*
peculiarly
for
the
Baron
.
She
was
acknowledged
to
be
quite
right
,
and
*NL*
the
two
parts
being
accepted
accordingly
,
she
was
certain
of
the
proper
*NL*
Frederick
.
Three
of
the
characters
were
now
cast
,
besides
Mr.
Rushworth
,
*NL*
who
was
always
answered
for
by
Maria
as
willing
to
do
anything
;
when
*NL*
Julia
,
meaning
,
like
her
sister
,
to
be
Agatha
,
began
to
be
scrupulous
on
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
not
behaving
well
by
the
absent
,
''
said
she
.
``
Here
are
not
women
*NL*
enough
.
Amelia
and
Agatha
may
do
for
Maria
and
me
,
but
here
is
nothing
*NL*
for
your
sister
,
Mr.
Crawford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
desired
_
that
_
might
not
be
thought
of
:
he
was
very
sure
*NL*
his
sister
had
no
wish
of
acting
but
as
she
might
be
useful
,
and
that
*NL*
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
be
considered
in
the
present
case
.
But
*NL*
this
was
immediately
opposed
by
Tom
Bertram
,
who
asserted
the
part
of
*NL*
Amelia
to
be
in
every
respect
the
property
of
Miss
Crawford
,
if
she
*NL*
would
accept
it
.
``
It
falls
as
naturally
,
as
necessarily
to
her
,
''
*NL*
said
he
,
``
as
Agatha
does
to
one
or
other
of
my
sisters
.
It
can
be
no
*NL*
sacrifice
on
their
side
,
for
it
is
highly
comic
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
silence
followed
.
Each
sister
looked
anxious
;
for
each
felt
the
*NL*
best
claim
to
Agatha
,
and
was
hoping
to
have
it
pressed
on
her
by
the
*NL*
rest
.
Henry
Crawford
,
who
meanwhile
had
taken
up
the
play
,
and
with
*NL*
seeming
carelessness
was
turning
over
the
first
act
,
soon
settled
the
*NL*
business
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
entreat
Miss
_
Julia
_
Bertram
,
''
said
he
,
``
not
to
engage
in
the
*NL*
part
of
Agatha
,
or
it
will
be
the
ruin
of
all
my
solemnity
.
You
must
*NL*
not
,
indeed
you
must
not
''
-LRB-
turning
to
her
-RRB-
.
``
I
could
not
stand
your
*NL*
countenance
dressed
up
in
woe
and
paleness
.
The
many
laughs
we
have
had
*NL*
together
would
infallibly
come
across
me
,
and
Frederick
and
his
knapsack
*NL*
would
be
obliged
to
run
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Pleasantly
,
courteously
,
it
was
spoken
;
but
the
manner
was
lost
in
the
*NL*
matter
to
Julia
's
feelings
.
She
saw
a
glance
at
Maria
which
confirmed
*NL*
the
injury
to
herself
:
it
was
a
scheme
,
a
trick
;
she
was
slighted
,
Maria
*NL*
was
preferred
;
the
smile
of
triumph
which
Maria
was
trying
to
suppress
*NL*
shewed
how
well
it
was
understood
;
and
before
Julia
could
command
*NL*
herself
enough
to
speak
,
her
brother
gave
his
weight
against
her
too
,
*NL*
by
saying
,
``
Oh
yes
!
Maria
must
be
Agatha
.
Maria
will
be
the
best
Agatha
.
*NL*
Though
Julia
fancies
she
prefers
tragedy
,
I
would
not
trust
her
in
it
.
*NL*
There
is
nothing
of
tragedy
about
her
.
She
has
not
the
look
of
it
.
Her
*NL*
features
are
not
tragic
features
,
and
she
walks
too
quick
,
and
speaks
*NL*
too
quick
,
and
would
not
keep
her
countenance
.
She
had
better
do
the
old
*NL*
countrywoman
:
the
Cottager
's
wife
;
you
had
,
indeed
,
Julia
.
Cottager
's
*NL*
wife
is
a
very
pretty
part
,
I
assure
you
.
The
old
lady
relieves
the
*NL*
high-flown
benevolence
of
her
husband
with
a
good
deal
of
spirit
.
You
*NL*
shall
be
Cottager
's
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cottager
's
wife
!
''
cried
Mr.
Yates
.
``
What
are
you
talking
of
?
The
most
*NL*
trivial
,
paltry
,
insignificant
part
;
the
merest
commonplace
;
not
a
*NL*
tolerable
speech
in
the
whole
.
Your
sister
do
that
!
It
is
an
insult
*NL*
to
propose
it
.
At
Ecclesford
the
governess
was
to
have
done
it
.
We
*NL*
all
agreed
that
it
could
not
be
offered
to
anybody
else
.
A
little
more
*NL*
justice
,
Mr.
Manager
,
if
you
please
.
You
do
not
deserve
the
office
,
if
*NL*
you
can
not
appreciate
the
talents
of
your
company
a
little
better
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
as
to
_
that
_
,
my
good
friend
,
till
I
and
my
company
have
really
*NL*
acted
there
must
be
some
guesswork
;
but
I
mean
no
disparagement
to
*NL*
Julia
.
We
can
not
have
two
Agathas
,
and
we
must
have
one
Cottager
's
*NL*
wife
;
and
I
am
sure
I
set
her
the
example
of
moderation
myself
in
being
*NL*
satisfied
with
the
old
Butler
.
If
the
part
is
trifling
she
will
have
*NL*
more
credit
in
making
something
of
it
;
and
if
she
is
so
desperately
bent
*NL*
against
everything
humorous
,
let
her
take
Cottager
's
speeches
instead
of
*NL*
Cottager
's
wife
's
,
and
so
change
the
parts
all
through
;
_
he
_
is
solemn
*NL*
and
pathetic
enough
,
I
am
sure
.
It
could
make
no
difference
in
the
play
,
*NL*
and
as
for
Cottager
himself
,
when
he
has
got
his
wife
's
speeches
,
_
I
_
*NL*
would
undertake
him
with
all
my
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
With
all
your
partiality
for
Cottager
's
wife
,
''
said
Henry
Crawford
,
``
it
*NL*
will
be
impossible
to
make
anything
of
it
fit
for
your
sister
,
and
we
*NL*
must
not
suffer
her
good-nature
to
be
imposed
on
.
We
must
not
_
allow
_
*NL*
her
to
accept
the
part
.
She
must
not
be
left
to
her
own
complaisance
.
*NL*
Her
talents
will
be
wanted
in
Amelia
.
Amelia
is
a
character
more
*NL*
difficult
to
be
well
represented
than
even
Agatha
.
I
consider
Amelia
*NL*
is
the
most
difficult
character
in
the
whole
piece
.
It
requires
great
*NL*
powers
,
great
nicety
,
to
give
her
playfulness
and
simplicity
without
*NL*
extravagance
.
I
have
seen
good
actresses
fail
in
the
part
.
Simplicity
,
*NL*
indeed
,
is
beyond
the
reach
of
almost
every
actress
by
profession
.
*NL*
It
requires
a
delicacy
of
feeling
which
they
have
not
.
It
requires
a
*NL*
gentlewoman
--
a
Julia
Bertram
.
You
_
will
_
undertake
it
,
I
hope
?
''
turning
*NL*
to
her
with
a
look
of
anxious
entreaty
,
which
softened
her
a
little
;
but
*NL*
while
she
hesitated
what
to
say
,
her
brother
again
interposed
with
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
better
claim
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
Julia
must
not
be
Amelia

It
is
not
at
all
the
part
for
her

*NL*
She
would
not
like
it
.
She
would
not
do
well
.
She
is
too
tall
and
*NL*
robust
.
Amelia
should
be
a
small
,
light
,
girlish
,
skipping
figure
.
It
is
*NL*
fit
for
Miss
Crawford
,
and
Miss
Crawford
only
.
She
looks
the
part
,
and
I
*NL*
am
persuaded
will
do
it
admirably

*NL*
*NL*
Without
attending
to
this
,
Henry
Crawford
continued
his
supplication
.
*NL*
``
You
must
oblige
us
,
''
said
he
,
``
indeed
you
must

When
you
have
studied
*NL*
the

Tragedy
may
be
your
*NL*
choice

it

certainly
appear
that
comedy
chuses
_
you

You
*NL*
will
be
to
visit
me
in
prison
with
a
basket
of
provisions
;
you
will
*NL*
not
refuse
to
visit
me
in

I
think
I
see
you
coming
in
with
your
*NL*
basket

''
*NL*
*NL*
The
influence
of
his
voice
was
felt
.
Julia
wavered
;
but
was
he
only
*NL*
trying
to
soothe
and
pacify
her
,
and
make
her
overlook
the
previous
*NL*
affront
?
She
distrusted
him
.
The
slight
had
been
most
determined
.
He
*NL*
was
,
perhaps
,
but
at
treacherous
play
with
her
.
She
looked
suspiciously
*NL*
at
her
sister
;
Maria
's
countenance
was
to
decide
it
:
if
she
were
vexed
*NL*
and
alarmed
--
but
Maria
looked
all
serenity
and
satisfaction
,
and
Julia
*NL*
well
knew
that
on
this
ground
Maria
could
not
be
happy
but
at
her
*NL*
expense
.
With
hasty
indignation
,
therefore
,
and
a
tremulous
voice
,
she
*NL*
said
to
him
,
``
You
do
not
seem
afraid
of
not
keeping
your
countenance
*NL*
when
I
come
in
with
a
basket
of
provisions
--
though
one
might
have
*NL*
supposed
--
but
it
is
only
as
Agatha
that
I
was
to
be
so
overpowering
!
''
*NL*
She
stopped
--
Henry
Crawford
looked
rather
foolish
,
and
as
if
he
did
not
*NL*
know
what
to
say
.
Tom
Bertram
began
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Crawford
must
be
Amelia

She
will
be
an
excellent
Amelia

*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
be
afraid
of
_
my
_
wanting
the
character

cried
Julia
,
with
*NL*
angry
quickness
:
``
I
am
_
not
_
to
be
Agatha
,
and
I
am
sure
I
will
do
*NL*
nothing
else
;
and
as
to
Amelia
,
it
is
of
all
parts
in
the
world
the
*NL*
most
disgusting
to
me
.
I
quite
detest
her
.
An
odious
,
little
,
pert
,
*NL*
unnatural
,
impudent
girl
.
I
have
always
protested
against
comedy
,
and
*NL*
this
is
comedy
in
its
worst
form
.
''
And
so
saying
,
she
walked
hastily
*NL*
out
of
the
room
,
leaving
awkward
feelings
to
more
than
one
,
but
exciting
*NL*
small
compassion
in
any
except
Fanny
,
who
had
been
a
quiet
auditor
of
*NL*
the
whole
,
and
who
could
not
think
of
her
as
under
the
agitations
of
*NL*
_
jealousy
_
without
great
pity
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
short
silence
succeeded
her
leaving
them
;
but
her
brother
soon
*NL*
returned
to
business
and
Lovers
'
Vows
,
and
was
eagerly
looking
over
*NL*
the
play
,
with
Mr.
Yates
's
help
,
to
ascertain
what
scenery
would
be
*NL*
necessary
--
while
Maria
and
Henry
Crawford
conversed
together
in
an
*NL*
under-voice
,
and
the
declaration
with
which
she
began
of
,
``
I
am
sure
I
*NL*
would
give
up
the
part
to
Julia
most
willingly
,
but
that
though
I
shall
*NL*
probably
do
it
very
ill
,
I
feel
persuaded
_
she
_
would
do
it
worse
,
''
was
*NL*
doubtless
receiving
all
the
compliments
it
called
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
this
had
lasted
some
time
,
the
division
of
the
party
was
completed
*NL*
by
Tom
Bertram
and
Mr.
Yates
walking
off
together
to
consult
farther
in
*NL*
the
room
now
beginning
to
be
called
_
the
_
_
Theatre
_
,
and
Miss
Bertram

*NL*
resolving
to
go
down
to
the
Parsonage
herself
with
the
offer
of
Amelia
*NL*
to
Miss
Crawford
;
and
Fanny
remained
alone

*NL*
*NL*
The
first
use
she
made
of
her
solitude
was
to
take
up
the
volume
which
*NL*
had
been
left
on
the
table
,
and
begin
to
acquaint
herself
with
the
play
*NL*
of
which
she
had
heard
so
much
.
Her
curiosity
was
all
awake
,
and
she
ran
*NL*
through
it
with
an
eagerness
which
was
suspended
only
by
intervals
of
*NL*
astonishment
,
that
it
could
be
chosen
in
the
present
instance
,
that
it
*NL*
could
be
proposed
and
accepted
in
a
private
theatre
!
Agatha
and
Amelia
*NL*
appeared
to
her
in
their
different
ways
so
totally
improper
for
home
*NL*
representation
--
the
situation
of
one
,
and
the
language
of
the
other
,
*NL*
so
unfit
to
be
expressed
by
any
woman
of
modesty
,
that
she
could
hardly
*NL*
suppose
her
cousins
could
be
aware
of
what
they
were
engaging
in
;
and
*NL*
longed
to
have
them
roused
as
soon
as
possible
by
the
remonstrance
which
*NL*
Edmund
would
certainly
make
.

CHAPTER
XV
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
accepted
the
part
very
readily
;
and
soon
after
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
's
return
from
the
Parsonage
,
Mr.
Rushworth
arrived
,
and
another
*NL*
character
was
consequently
cast
.
He
had
the
offer
of
Count
Cassel
*NL*
and
Anhalt
,
and
at
first
did
not
know
which
to
chuse
,
and
wanted
Miss
*NL*
Bertram
to
direct
him
;
but
upon
being
made
to
understand
the
different
*NL*
style
of
the
characters
,
and
which
was
which
,
and
recollecting
that
he
*NL*
had
once
seen
the
play
in
London
,
and
had
thought
Anhalt
a
very
stupid
*NL*
fellow
,
he
soon
decided
for
the
Count
.
Miss
Bertram
approved
the
*NL*
decision
,
for
the
less
he
had
to
learn
the
better
;
and
though
she
could
*NL*
not
sympathise
in
his
wish
that
the
Count
and
Agatha
might
be
to
act
*NL*
together
,
nor
wait
very
patiently
while
he
was
slowly
turning
over
the
*NL*
leaves
with
the
hope
of
still
discovering
such
a
scene
,
she
very
kindly
*NL*
took
his
part
in
hand
,
and
curtailed
every
speech
that
admitted
being
*NL*
shortened
;
besides
pointing
out
the
necessity
of
his
being
very
much
*NL*
dressed
,
and
chusing
his
colours
.
Mr.
Rushworth
liked
the
idea
of
his
*NL*
finery
very
well
,
though
affecting
to
despise
it
;
and
was
too
much
*NL*
engaged
with
what
his
own
appearance
would
be
to
think
of
the
others
,
*NL*
or
draw
any
of
those
conclusions
,
or
feel
any
of
that
displeasure
which
*NL*
Maria
had
been
half
prepared
for
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thus
much
was
settled
before
Edmund
,
who
had
been
out
all
the
morning
,
*NL*
knew
anything
of
the
matter
;
but
when
he
entered
the
drawing-room
before
*NL*
dinner
,
the
buzz
of
discussion
was
high
between
Tom
,
Maria
,
and
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
;
and
Mr.
Rushworth
stepped
forward
with
great
alacrity
to
tell
him
*NL*
the
agreeable
news
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
got
a
play
,
''
said
he
.
``
It
is
to
be
Lovers
'
Vows
;
and
I
am
to
be
*NL*
Count
Cassel
,
and
am
to
come
in
first
with
a
blue
dress
and
a
pink
satin
*NL*
cloak
,
and
afterwards
am
to
have
another
fine
fancy
suit
,
by
way
of
a
*NL*
shooting-dress
.
I
do
not
know
how
I
shall
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
eyes
followed
Edmund
,
and
her
heart
beat
for
him
as
she
heard
*NL*
this
speech
,
and
saw
his
look
,
and
felt
what
his
sensations
must
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lovers
'
Vows
!
''
in
a
tone
of
the
greatest
amazement
,
was
his
only
reply
*NL*
to
Mr.
Rushworth
,
and
he
turned
towards
his
brother
and
sisters
as
if
*NL*
hardly
doubting
a
contradiction
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
cried
Mr.
Yates
.
``
After
all
our
debatings
and
difficulties
,
we
*NL*
find
there
is
nothing
that
will
suit
us
altogether
so
well
,
nothing
so
*NL*
unexceptionable
,
as
Lovers
'
Vows
.
The
wonder
is
that
it
should
not
have
*NL*
been
thought
of
before
.
My
stupidity
was
abominable
,
for
here
we
have
*NL*
all
the
advantage
of
what
I
saw
at
Ecclesford
;
and
it
is
so
useful
to
*NL*
have
anything
of
a
model
!
We
have
cast
almost
every
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
do
you
do
for
women
?
''
said
Edmund
gravely
,
and
looking
at
*NL*
Maria
.
*NL*
*NL*
Maria
blushed
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
answered
,
``
I
take
the
part
*NL*
which
Lady
Ravenshaw
was
to
have
done
,
and
''
-LRB-
with
a
bolder
eye
-RRB-
``
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
is
to
be
Amelia
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
not
have
thought
it
the
sort
of
play
to
be
so
easily
filled
*NL*
up
,
with
_
us
_
,
''
replied
Edmund
,
turning
away
to
the
fire
,
where
sat
*NL*
his
mother
,
aunt
,
and
Fanny
,
and
seating
himself
with
a
look
of
great
*NL*
vexation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
followed
him
to
say
,
``
I
come
in
three
times
,
and
have
*NL*
two-and-forty
speeches
.
That
's
something
,
is
not
it
?
But
I
do
not
much
*NL*
like
the
idea
of
being
so
fine
.
I
shall
hardly
know
myself
in
a
blue
*NL*
dress
and
a
pink
satin
cloak
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
could
not
answer
him
.
In
a
few
minutes
Mr.
Bertram
was
called
*NL*
out
of
the
room
to
satisfy
some
doubts
of
the
carpenter
;
and
being
*NL*
accompanied
by
Mr.
Yates
,
and
followed
soon
afterwards
by
Mr.
Rushworth
,
*NL*
Edmund
almost
immediately
took
the
opportunity
of
saying
,
``
I
can
not
,
*NL*
before
Mr.
Yates
,
speak
what
I
feel
as
to
this
play
,
without
reflecting
*NL*
on
his
friends
at
Ecclesford
;
but
I
must
now
,
my
dear
Maria
,
tell
_
you
_
,
*NL*
that
I
think
it
exceedingly
unfit
for
private
representation
,
and
that
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
give
it
up
.
I
can
not
but
suppose
you
_
will
_
when
you
have
*NL*
read
it
carefully
over
.
Read
only
the
first
act
aloud
to
either
your
*NL*
mother
or
aunt
,
and
see
how
you
can
approve
it
.
It
will
not
be
necessary
*NL*
to
send
you
to
your
_
father
's
_
judgment
,
I
am
convinced
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
see
things
very
differently
,
''
cried
Maria
.
``
I
am
perfectly
*NL*
acquainted
with
the
play
,
I
assure
you
;
and
with
a
very
few
omissions
,
*NL*
and
so
forth
,
which
will
be
made
,
of
course
,
I
can
see
nothing
*NL*
objectionable
in
it
;
and
_
I
_
am
not
the
_
only
_
young
woman
you
find
who
*NL*
thinks
it
very
fit
for
private
representation
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for
it
,
''
was
his
answer
;
``
but
in
this
matter
it
is
_
you
_
who
*NL*
are
to
lead
.
_
You
_
must
set
the
example
.
If
others
have
blundered
,
it
*NL*
is
your
place
to
put
them
right
,
and
shew
them
what
true
delicacy
is
.
*NL*
In
all
points
of
decorum
_
your
_
conduct
must
be
law
to
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
picture
of
her
consequence
had
some
effect
,
for
no
one
loved
better
*NL*
to
lead
than
Maria
;
and
with
far
more
good-humour
she
answered
,
``
I
am
*NL*
much
obliged
to
you
,
Edmund
;
you
mean
very
well
,
I
am
sure
:
but
I
still
*NL*
think
you
see
things
too
strongly
;
and
I
really
can
not
undertake
to
*NL*
harangue
all
the
rest
upon
a
subject
of
this
kind
.
_
There
_
would
be
the
*NL*
greatest
indecorum
,
I
think
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
imagine
that
I
could
have
such
an
idea
in
my
head
?
No
;
let
your
*NL*
conduct
be
the
only
harangue
.
Say
that
,
on
examining
the
part
,
you
feel
*NL*
yourself
unequal
to
it
;
that
you
find
it
requiring
more
exertion
and
*NL*
confidence
than
you
can
be
supposed
to
have
.
Say
this
with
firmness
,
and
*NL*
it
will
be
quite
enough
.
All
who
can
distinguish
will
understand
your
*NL*
motive
.
The
play
will
be
given
up
,
and
your
delicacy
honoured
as
it
*NL*
ought
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
act
anything
improper

my
dear

said
Lady
Bertram
.
``
Sir
Thomas
*NL*

not
like

ring

To
be

sure

Julia

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
convinced

said
Edmund

preventing
Fanny
,
``
that
Sir
Thomas

not

it

*NL*
*NL*
``
There

my

do
you
hear

*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
were
to
decline
the
part

said
Maria

with
renewed
zeal

``
Julia

would
certainly
take
it

*NL*
``
What

cried
Edmund
,
``
if
she
knew
your
reasons

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
she
might
think
the
difference

us

the
difference
in
our
*NL*
situations

that
_
she
_
need
not
be
so
scrupulous
as
_
I
_
might
feel
*NL*
necessary
.
I
am
sure
she
would
argue
so

No
;
you
must
excuse
me
;
I
*NL*
can
not
retract
my
consent
;
it
is
too
far
settled
,
everybody
would
be
so
*NL*
disappointed
,
Tom
would
be
quite
angry
;
and
if
we
are
so
very
nice
,
we
*NL*
shall
never
act
anything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
just
going
to
say
the
very
same
thing
,
''
said
Mrs.
Norris
.
*NL*
``
If
every
play
is
to
be
objected
to
,
you
will
act
nothing
,
and
the
*NL*
preparations
will
be
all
so
much
money
thrown
away
,
and
I
am
sure
_
that
_
*NL*
would
be
a
discredit
to
us
all
.
I
do
not
know
the
play
;
but
,
as
Maria
*NL*
says
,
if
there
is
anything
a
little
too
warm
-LRB-
and
it
is
so
with
most
of
*NL*
them
-RRB-
it
can
be
easily
left
out
.
We
must
not
be
over-precise
,
Edmund
.
As
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
is
to
act
too
,
there
can
be
no
harm
.
I
only
wish
Tom
had
*NL*
known
his
own
mind
when
the
carpenters
began
,
for
there
was
the
loss
*NL*
of
half
a
day
's
work
about
those
side-doors
.
The
curtain
will
be
a
good
*NL*
job
,
however
.
The
maids
do
their
work
very
well
,
and
I
think
we
shall
be
*NL*
able
to
send
back
some
dozens
of
the
rings
.
There
is
no
occasion
to
put
*NL*
them
so
very
close
together
.
I
_
am
_
of
some
use
,
I
hope
,
in
preventing
*NL*
waste
and
making
the
most
of
things
.
There
should
always
be
one
*NL*
steady
head
to
superintend
so
many
young
ones
.
I
forgot
to
tell
Tom
of
*NL*
something
that
happened
to
me
this
very
day
.
I
had
been
looking
about
me
*NL*
in
the
poultry-yard
,
and
was
just
coming
out
,
when
who
should
I
see
but
*NL*
Dick
Jackson
making
up
to
the
servants
'
hall-door
with
two
bits
of
deal
*NL*
board
in
his
hand
,
bringing
them
to
father
,
you
may
be
sure
;
mother
had
*NL*
chanced
to
send
him
of
a
message
to
father
,
and
then
father
had
bid
*NL*
him
bring
up
them
two
bits
of
board
,
for
he
could
not
no
how
do
without
*NL*
them
.
I
knew
what
all
this
meant
,
for
the
servants
'
dinner-bell
*NL*
was
ringing
at
the
very
moment
over
our
heads
;
and
as
I
hate
such
*NL*
encroaching
people
-LRB-
the
Jacksons
are
very
encroaching
,
I
have
always
*NL*
said
so
:
just
the
sort
of
people
to
get
all
they
can
-RRB-
,
I
said
to
the
boy
*NL*
directly
-LRB-
a
great
lubberly
fellow
of
ten
years
old
,
you
know
,
who
ought
*NL*
to
be
ashamed
of
himself
-RRB-
,
'
_
I
'll
_
take
the
boards
to
your
father
,
Dick
,
*NL*
so
get
you
home
again
as
fast
as
you
can
.
'
The
boy
looked
very
silly
,
*NL*
and
turned
away
without
offering
a
word
,
for
I
believe
I
might
speak
*NL*
pretty
sharp
;
and
I
dare
say
it
will
cure
him
of
coming
marauding
about
*NL*
the
house
for
one
while
.
I
hate
such
greediness
--
so
good
as
your
father
*NL*
is
to
the
family
,
employing
the
man
all
the
year
round
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nobody
was
at
the
trouble
of
an
answer
;
the
others
soon
returned
;
and
*NL*
Edmund
found
that
to
have
endeavoured
to
set
them
right
must
be
his
only
*NL*
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Dinner
passed
heavily
.
Mrs.
Norris
related
again
her
triumph
over
Dick
*NL*
Jackson
,
but
neither
play
nor
preparation
were
otherwise
much
talked
*NL*
of
,
for
Edmund
's
disapprobation
was
felt
even
by
his
brother
,
though
*NL*
he
would
not
have
owned
it
.
Maria
,
wanting
Henry
Crawford
's
animating
*NL*
support
,
thought
the
subject
better
avoided
.
Mr.
Yates
,
who
was
trying
*NL*
to
make
himself
agreeable
to
Julia
,
found
her
gloom
less
impenetrable
on
*NL*
any
topic
than
that
of
his
regret
at
her
secession
from
their
company
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Rushworth
,
having
only
his
own
part
and
his
own
dress
in
his
*NL*
head
,
had
soon
talked
away
all
that
could
be
said
of
either
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
the
concerns
of
the
theatre
were
suspended
only
for
an
hour
or
two
:
*NL*
there
was
still
a
great
deal
to
be
settled
;
and
the
spirits
of
evening
*NL*
giving
fresh
courage
,
Tom
,
Maria
,
and
Mr.
Yates
,
soon
after
their
being
*NL*
reassembled
in
the
drawing-room
,
seated
themselves
in
committee
at
a
*NL*
separate
table
,
with
the
play
open
before
them
,
and
were
just
getting
*NL*
deep
in
the
subject
when
a
most
welcome
interruption
was
given
by
the
*NL*
entrance
of
Mr.
and
Miss
Crawford
,
who
,
late
and
dark
and
dirty
as
it
*NL*
was
,
could
not
help
coming
,
and
were
received
with
the
most
grateful
*NL*
joy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well

how
do
you
go
on
?
''
and
``
What
have
you
settled
?
''
and
``
Oh
!
we
*NL*
can
do
nothing
without
you
,
''
followed
the
first
salutations
;
and
Henry
*NL*
Crawford
was
soon
seated
with
the
other
three
at
the
table
,
while
his
*NL*
sister
made
her
way
to
Lady
Bertram
,
and
with
pleasant
attention
was
*NL*
complimenting
_
her
_
.
``
I
must
really
congratulate
your
ladyship
,
''
said
*NL*
she
,
``
on
the
play
being
chosen
;
for
though
you
have
borne
it
with
*NL*
exemplary
patience
,
I
am
sure
you
must
be
sick
of
all
our
noise
and
*NL*
difficulties
.
The
actors
may
be
glad
,
but
the
bystanders
must
be
*NL*
infinitely
more
thankful
for
a
decision
;
and
I
do
sincerely
give
you
*NL*
joy
,
madam
,
as
well
as
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
everybody
else
who
is
in
the
*NL*
same
predicament
,
''
glancing
half
fearfully
,
half
slyly
,
beyond
Fanny
to
*NL*
Edmund
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
very
civilly
answered
by
Lady
Bertram
,
but
Edmund
said
nothing
.
*NL*
His
being
only
a
bystander
was
not
disclaimed
.
After
continuing
in
chat
*NL*
with
the
party
round
the
fire
a
few
minutes
,
Miss
Crawford
returned
*NL*
to
the
party
round
the
table
;
and
standing
by
them
,
seemed
to
*NL*
interest
herself
in
their
arrangements
till
,
as
if
struck
by
a
sudden
*NL*
recollection
,
she
exclaimed
,
``
My
good
friends
,
you
are
most
composedly
*NL*
at
work
upon
these
cottages
and
alehouses
,
inside
and
out
;
but
pray
let
*NL*
me
know
my
fate
in
the
meanwhile
.
Who
is
to
be
Anhalt
?
What
gentleman
*NL*
among
you
am
I
to
have
the
pleasure
of
making
love
to
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
moment
no
one
spoke
;
and
then
many
spoke
together
to
tell
the
same
*NL*
melancholy
truth
,
that
they
had
not
yet
got
any
Anhalt
.
``
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
was
to
be
Count
Cassel
,
but
no
one
had
yet
undertaken
Anhalt
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
my
choice
of
the
parts
,
''
said
Mr.
Rushworth
;
``
but
I
thought
I
*NL*
should
like
the
Count
best
,
though
I
do
not
much
relish
the
finery
I
am
*NL*
to
have
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
chose
very
wisely
,
I
am
sure
,
''
replied
Miss
Crawford
,
with
a
*NL*
brightened
look
;
``
Anhalt
is
a
heavy
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
The
_
_
Count
_
has
two-and-forty
speeches
,
''
returned
Mr.
Rushworth
,
*NL*
``
which
is
no
trifle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
at
all
surprised
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
after
a
short
pause
,
*NL*
``
at
this
want
of
an
Anhalt
.
Amelia
deserves
no
better
.
Such
a
forward
*NL*
young
lady
may
well
frighten
the
men
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
be
but
too
happy
in
taking
the
part
,
if
it
were
possible
,
''
*NL*
cried
Tom
;
``
but
,
unluckily
,
the
Butler
and
Anhalt
are
in
together
.
I
*NL*
will
not
entirely
give
it
up
,
however
;
I
will
try
what
can
be
done
--
I
*NL*
will
look
it
over
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
_
brother
_
should
take
the
part

''
said
Mr.
Yates
,
in
a
low
voice
.
*NL*
``
Do
not
you
think
he
would
?

*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
shall
not
ask
him

replied
Tom
,
in
a
cold
,
determined
manner
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
talked
of
something
else
,
and
soon
afterwards
rejoined
the
*NL*
party
at
the
fire
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
They
do
not
want
me
at
all
,
''
said
she
,
seating
herself
.
``
I
only
puzzle
*NL*
them
,
and
oblige
them
to
make
civil
speeches
.
Mr.
Edmund
Bertram
,
as
*NL*
you
do
not
act
yourself
,
you
will
be
a
disinterested
adviser
;
and
,
*NL*
therefore
,
I
apply
to
_
you
_
.
What
shall
we
do
for
an
Anhalt
?
Is
it
*NL*
practicable
for
any
of
the
others
to
double
it
?
What
is
your
advice
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
advice
,
''
said
he
calmly
,
``
is
that
you
change
the
play
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
I
_
should
have
no
objection

she
replied
;
``
for
though
I
should
not
*NL*
particularly
dislike
the
part
of
Amelia

well
supported
,
that
is
,
if
*NL*
everything
went
well
,
I
shall
be
sorry
to
be
an
inconvenience

*NL*
as
they
do
not
chuse
to
hear
your
advice
at

-LRB-
looking
*NL*
round
-RRB-
,
``
it
certainly
will
not
be
taken
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
said
no
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
_
any
_
part
could
tempt
_
you
_
to
act
,
I
suppose
it
would
be
Anhalt
,
''
*NL*
observed
the
lady
archly
,
after
a
short
pause
;
``
for
he
is
a
clergyman
,
*NL*
you
know
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
That
_
circumstance
would
by
no
means
tempt
me
,
''
he
replied
,
``
for
I
*NL*
should
be
sorry
to
make
the
character
ridiculous
by
bad
acting
.
It
*NL*
must
be
very
difficult
to
keep
Anhalt
from
appearing
a
formal
,
solemn
*NL*
lecturer
;
and
the
man
who
chuses
the
profession
itself
is
,
perhaps
,
one
*NL*
of
the
last
who
would
wish
to
represent
it
on
the
stage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
was
silenced
,
and
with
some
feelings
of
resentment
and
*NL*
mortification
,
moved
her
chair
considerably
nearer
the
tea-table
,
and
*NL*
gave
all
her
attention
to
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
was
presiding
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
,
''
cried
Tom
Bertram
,
from
the
other
table
,
where
the
conference
*NL*
was
eagerly
carrying
on
,
and
the
conversation
incessant
,
``
we
want
your
*NL*
services
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
up
in
a
moment
,
expecting
some
errand
;
for
the
habit
of
*NL*
employing
her
in
that
way
was
not
yet
overcome
,
in
spite
of
all
that
*NL*
Edmund
could
do
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
we
do
not
want
to
disturb
you
from
your
seat
.
We
do
not
want
your
*NL*
_
present
_
services
.
We
shall
only
want
you
in
our
play
.
You
must
be
*NL*
Cottager
's
wife
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Me
!
''
cried
Fanny
,
sitting
down
again
with
a
most
frightened
look
.
*NL*
``
Indeed
you
must
excuse
me
.
I
could
not
act
anything
if
you
were
to
give
*NL*
me
the
world

No
,
indeed
,
I
can
not
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
but
you
must
,
for
we
can
not
excuse
you

It
need
not
frighten
*NL*
you
:
it
is
a
nothing
of
a
part
,
a
mere
nothing
,
not
above
half
a
dozen
*NL*
speeches
altogether
,
and
it
will
not
much
signify
if
nobody
hears
a
word
*NL*
you
say
;
so
you
may
be
as
creep-mouse
as
you
like
,
but
we
must
have
you
*NL*
to
look
at
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
you
are
afraid
of
half
a
dozen
speeches
,
''
cried
Mr.
Rushworth
,
``
what
*NL*
would
you
do
with
such
a
part
as
mine
?
I
have
forty-two
to
learn
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
that
I
am
afraid
of
learning
by
heart
,
''
said
Fanny
,
shocked
*NL*
to
find
herself
at
that
moment
the
only
speaker
in
the
room
,
and
to
feel
*NL*
that
almost
every
eye
was
upon
her
;
``
but
I
really
can
not
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
yes
,
you
can
act
well
enough
for
_
us
_
.
Learn
your
part
,
and
we
*NL*
will
teach
you
all
the
rest
.
You
have
only
two
scenes
,
and
as
I
shall
*NL*
be
Cottager
,
I
'll
put
you
in
and
push
you
about
,
and
you
will
do
it
very
*NL*
well
,
I
'll
answer
for
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
Mr.
Bertram
,
you
must
excuse
me
.
You
can
not
have
an
idea
.
*NL*
It
would
be
absolutely
impossible
for
me
.
If
I
were
to
undertake
it
,
I
*NL*
should
only
disappoint
you
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoo
!
Phoo
!
Do
not
be
so
shamefaced
.
You
'll
do
it
very
well
.
Every
*NL*
allowance
will
be
made
for
you
.
We
do
not
expect
perfection
.
You
must
*NL*
get
a
brown
gown
,
and
a
white
apron
,
and
a
mob
cap
,
and
we
must
make
*NL*
you
a
few
wrinkles
,
and
a
little
of
the
crowsfoot
at
the
corner
of
your
*NL*
eyes
,
and
you
will
be
a
very
proper
,
little
old
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
excuse
me
,
indeed
you
must
excuse
me
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
growing
*NL*
more
and
more
red
from
excessive
agitation
,
and
looking
distressfully
*NL*
at
Edmund
,
who
was
kindly
observing
her
;
but
unwilling
to
exasperate
*NL*
his
brother
by
interference
,
gave
her
only
an
encouraging
smile
.
Her
*NL*
entreaty
had
no
effect
on
Tom
:
he
only
said
again
what
he
had
said
*NL*
before
;
and
it
was
not
merely
Tom
,
for
the
requisition
was
now
backed
by
*NL*
Maria
,
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
Mr.
Yates
,
with
an
urgency
which
differed
*NL*
from
his
but
in
being
more
gentle
or
more
ceremonious
,
and
which
*NL*
altogether
was
quite
overpowering
to
Fanny
;
and
before
she
could
breathe
*NL*
after
it
,
Mrs.
Norris
completed
the
whole
by
thus
addressing
her
in
a
*NL*
whisper
at
once
angry
and
audible
--
``
What
a
piece
of
work
here
is
about
*NL*
nothing
:
I
am
quite
ashamed
of
you
,
Fanny
,
to
make
such
a
difficulty
of
*NL*
obliging
your
cousins
in
a
trifle
of
this
sort
--
so
kind
as
they
are
to
*NL*
you
!
Take
the
part
with
a
good
grace
,
and
let
us
hear
no
more
of
the
*NL*
matter
,
I
entreat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
not
urge
her
,
madam
,
''
said
Edmund
.
``
It
is
not
fair
to
urge
her
*NL*
in
this
manner
.
You
see
she
does
not
like
to
act
.
Let
her
chuse
for
*NL*
herself
,
as
well
as
the
rest
of
us
.
Her
judgment
may
be
quite
as
safely
*NL*
trusted
.
Do
not
urge
her
any
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
going
to
urge
her
,
''
replied
Mrs.
Norris
sharply
;
``
but
I
shall
*NL*
think
her
a
very
obstinate
,
ungrateful
girl
,
if
she
does
not
do
what
her
*NL*
aunt
and
cousins
wish
her
--
very
ungrateful
,
indeed
,
considering
who
and
*NL*
what
she
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
too
angry
to
speak
;
but
Miss
Crawford
,
looking
for
a
moment
*NL*
with
astonished
eyes
at
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
then
at
Fanny
,
whose
tears
were
*NL*
beginning
to
shew
themselves
,
immediately
said
,
with
some
keenness
,
``
I
*NL*
do
not
like
my
situation
:
this
_
place
_
is
too
hot
for
me
,
''
and
moved
*NL*
away
her
chair
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
,
close
to
Fanny
,
saying
*NL*
to
her
,
in
a
kind
,
low
whisper
,
as
she
placed
herself
,
``
Never
mind
,
*NL*
my
dear
Miss
Price
,
this
is
a
cross
evening
:
everybody
is
cross
and
*NL*
teasing
,
but
do
not
let
us
mind
them
''
;
and
with
pointed
attention
*NL*
continued
to
talk
to
her
and
endeavour
to
raise
her
spirits
,
in
spite
of
*NL*
being
out
of
spirits
herself
.
By
a
look
at
her
brother
she
prevented
any
*NL*
farther
entreaty
from
the
theatrical
board
,
and
the
really
good
feelings
*NL*
by
which
she
was
almost
purely
governed
were
rapidly
restoring
her
to
*NL*
all
the
little
she
had
lost
in
Edmund
's
favour
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
did
not
love
Miss
Crawford
;
but
she
felt
very
much
obliged
to
her
*NL*
for
her
present
kindness
;
and
when
,
from
taking
notice
of
her
work
,
*NL*
and
wishing
_
she
_
could
work
as
well
,
and
begging
for
the
pattern
,
and
*NL*
supposing
Fanny
was
now
preparing
for
her
_
appearance
_
,
as
of
course
she
*NL*
would
come
out
when
her
cousin
was
married
,
Miss
Crawford
proceeded
to
*NL*
inquire
if
she
had
heard
lately
from
her
brother
at
sea
,
and
said
that
*NL*
she
had
quite
a
curiosity
to
see
him
,
and
imagined
him
a
very
fine
young
*NL*
man
,
and
advised
Fanny
to
get
his
picture
drawn
before
he
went
to
sea
*NL*
again
--
she
could
not
help
admitting
it
to
be
very
agreeable
flattery
,
or
*NL*
help
listening
,
and
answering
with
more
animation
than
she
had
intended
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
consultation
upon
the
play
still
went
on
,
and
Miss
Crawford
's
*NL*
attention
was
first
called
from
Fanny
by
Tom
Bertram
's
telling
her
,
*NL*
with
infinite
regret
,
that
he
found
it
absolutely
impossible
for
him
to
*NL*
undertake
the
part
of
Anhalt
in
addition
to
the
Butler
:
he
had
been
most
*NL*
anxiously
trying
to
make
it
out
to
be
feasible
,
but
it
would
not
do
;
*NL*
he
must
give
it
up
.
``
But
there
will
not
be
the
smallest
difficulty
in
*NL*
filling
it
,
''
he
added
.
``
We
have
but
to
speak
the
word
;
we
may
pick
and
*NL*
chuse
.
I
could
name
,
at
this
moment
,
at
least
six
young
men
within
six
*NL*
miles
of
us
,
who
are
wild
to
be
admitted
into
our
company
,
and
there
are
*NL*
one
or
two
that
would
not
disgrace
us
:
I
should
not
be
afraid
to
trust
*NL*
either
of
the
Olivers
or
Charles
Maddox
.
Tom
Oliver
is
a
very
clever
*NL*
fellow
,
and
Charles
Maddox
is
as
gentlemanlike
a
man
as
you
will
see
*NL*
anywhere
,
so
I
will
take
my
horse
early
to-morrow
morning
and
ride
over
*NL*
to
Stoke
,
and
settle
with
one
of
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
While
he
spoke
,
Maria
was
looking
apprehensively
round
at
Edmund
in
full
*NL*
expectation
that
he
must
oppose
such
an
enlargement
of
the
plan
as
this
:
*NL*
so
contrary
to
all
their
first
protestations
;
but
Edmund
said
nothing
.
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
thought
,
Miss
Crawford
calmly
replied
,
``
As
far
as
I
*NL*
am
concerned
,
I
can
have
no
objection
to
anything
that
you
all
think
*NL*
eligible
.
Have
I
ever
seen
either
of
the
gentlemen
?
Yes
,
Mr.
Charles
*NL*
Maddox
dined
at
my
sister
's
one
day
,
did
not
he
,
Henry
?
A
quiet-looking
*NL*
young
man
.
I
remember
him
.
Let
_
him
_
be
applied
to
,
if
you
please
,
for
*NL*
it
will
be
less
unpleasant
to
me
than
to
have
a
perfect
stranger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Charles
Maddox
was
to
be
the
man
.
Tom
repeated
his
resolution
of
going
*NL*
to
him
early
on
the
morrow
;
and
though
Julia
,
who
had
scarcely
opened
*NL*
her
lips
before
,
observed
,
in
a
sarcastic
manner
,
and
with
a
glance
*NL*
first
at
Maria
and
then
at
Edmund
,
that
``
the
Mansfield
theatricals
would
*NL*
enliven
the
whole
neighbourhood
exceedingly
,
''
Edmund
still
held
his
*NL*
peace
,
and
shewed
his
feelings
only
by
a
determined
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
very
sanguine

said
Miss
Crawford
,
in
an
*NL*
undervoice
to
Fanny
,
after
some
consideration
;
``
and
I
can
tell
Mr.

Maddox
that
I
shall
shorten
some
of

a
great
many
of

_
my
_
_
own
_
,
before
we
rehearse
together

will
be
very
disagreeable

by
no

CHAPTER
XVI
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
not
in
Miss
Crawford
's
power
to
talk
Fanny
into
any
real
*NL*
forgetfulness
of
what
had
passed
.
When
the
evening
was
over
,
she
went
to
*NL*
bed
full
of
it
,
her
nerves
still
agitated
by
the
shock
of
such
an
attack
*NL*
from
her
cousin
Tom
,
so
public
and
so
persevered
in
,
and
her
spirits
*NL*
sinking
under
her
aunt
's
unkind
reflection
and
reproach
.
To
be
called
*NL*
into
notice
in
such
a
manner
,
to
hear
that
it
was
but
the
prelude
to
*NL*
something
so
infinitely
worse
,
to
be
told
that
she
must
do
what
was
*NL*
so
impossible
as
to
act
;
and
then
to
have
the
charge
of
obstinacy
and
*NL*
ingratitude
follow
it
,
enforced
with
such
a
hint
at
the
dependence
*NL*
of
her
situation
,
had
been
too
distressing
at
the
time
to
make
the
*NL*
remembrance
when
she
was
alone
much
less
so
,
especially
with
the
*NL*
superadded
dread
of
what
the
morrow
might
produce
in
continuation
of
the
*NL*
subject
.
Miss
Crawford
had
protected
her
only
for
the
time
;
and
if
*NL*
she
were
applied
to
again
among
themselves
with
all
the
authoritative
*NL*
urgency
that
Tom
and
Maria
were
capable
of
,
and
Edmund
perhaps
away
,
*NL*
what
should
she
do
?
She
fell
asleep
before
she
could
answer
the
*NL*
question
,
and
found
it
quite
as
puzzling
when
she
awoke
the
next
*NL*
morning
.
The
little
white
attic
,
which
had
continued
her
sleeping-room
*NL*
ever
since
her
first
entering
the
family
,
proving
incompetent
to
suggest
*NL*
any
reply
,
she
had
recourse
,
as
soon
as
she
was
dressed
,
to
another
*NL*
apartment
more
spacious
and
more
meet
for
walking
about
in
and
thinking
,
*NL*
and
of
which
she
had
now
for
some
time
been
almost
equally
mistress
.
It
*NL*
had
been
their
school-room
;
so
called
till
the
Miss
Bertrams
would
not
*NL*
allow
it
to
be
called
so
any
longer
,
and
inhabited
as
such
to
a
later
*NL*
period
.
There
Miss
Lee
had
lived
,
and
there
they
had
read
and
written
,
*NL*
and
talked
and
laughed
,
till
within
the
last
three
years
,
when
she
had
*NL*
quitted
them
.
The
room
had
then
become
useless
,
and
for
some
time
was
*NL*
quite
deserted
,
except
by
Fanny
,
when
she
visited
her
plants
,
or
wanted
*NL*
one
of
the
books
,
which
she
was
still
glad
to
keep
there
,
from
the
*NL*
deficiency
of
space
and
accommodation
in
her
little
chamber
above
:
but
*NL*
gradually
,
as
her
value
for
the
comforts
of
it
increased
,
she
had
added
*NL*
to
her
possessions
,
and
spent
more
of
her
time
there
;
and
having
nothing
*NL*
to
oppose
her
,
had
so
naturally
and
so
artlessly
worked
herself
into
it
,
*NL*
that
it
was
now
generally
admitted
to
be
hers
.
The
East
room
,
as
it
had
*NL*
been
called
ever
since
Maria
Bertram
was
sixteen
,
was
now
considered
*NL*
Fanny
's
,
almost
as
decidedly
as
the
white
attic
:
the
smallness
of
the
*NL*
one
making
the
use
of
the
other
so
evidently
reasonable
that
the
Miss
*NL*
Bertrams
,
with
every
superiority
in
their
own
apartments
which
their
own
*NL*
sense
of
superiority
could
demand
,
were
entirely
approving
it
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
,
having
stipulated
for
there
never
being
a
fire
in
it
on
Fanny
's
*NL*
account
,
was
tolerably
resigned
to
her
having
the
use
of
what
nobody
*NL*
else
wanted
,
though
the
terms
in
which
she
sometimes
spoke
of
the
*NL*
indulgence
seemed
to
imply
that
it
was
the
best
room
in
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
aspect
was
so
favourable
that
even
without
a
fire
it
was
habitable
*NL*
in
many
an
early
spring
and
late
autumn
morning
to
such
a
willing
mind
*NL*
as
Fanny
's
;
and
while
there
was
a
gleam
of
sunshine
she
hoped
not
to
be
*NL*
driven
from
it
entirely
,
even
when
winter
came
.
The
comfort
of
it
in
*NL*
her
hours
of
leisure
was
extreme
.
She
could
go
there
after
anything
*NL*
unpleasant
below
,
and
find
immediate
consolation
in
some
pursuit
,
or
*NL*
some
train
of
thought
at
hand
.
Her
plants
,
her
books
--
of
which
she
had
*NL*
been
a
collector
from
the
first
hour
of
her
commanding
a
shilling
--
her
*NL*
writing-desk
,
and
her
works
of
charity
and
ingenuity
,
were
all
within
*NL*
her
reach
;
or
if
indisposed
for
employment
,
if
nothing
but
musing
would
*NL*
do
,
she
could
scarcely
see
an
object
in
that
room
which
had
not
an
*NL*
interesting
remembrance
connected
with
it
.
Everything
was
a
friend
,
or
*NL*
bore
her
thoughts
to
a
friend
;
and
though
there
had
been
sometimes
much
*NL*
of
suffering
to
her
;
though
her
motives
had
often
been
misunderstood
,
*NL*
her
feelings
disregarded
,
and
her
comprehension
undervalued
;
though
she
*NL*
had
known
the
pains
of
tyranny
,
of
ridicule
,
and
neglect
,
yet
almost
*NL*
every
recurrence
of
either
had
led
to
something
consolatory
:
her
aunt
*NL*
Bertram
had
spoken
for
her
,
or
Miss
Lee
had
been
encouraging
,
or
,
what
*NL*
was
yet
more
frequent
or
more
dear
,
Edmund
had
been
her
champion
and
her
*NL*
friend
:
he
had
supported
her
cause
or
explained
her
meaning
,
he
had
told
*NL*
her
not
to
cry
,
or
had
given
her
some
proof
of
affection
which
made
*NL*
her
tears
delightful
;
and
the
whole
was
now
so
blended
together
,
so
*NL*
harmonised
by
distance
,
that
every
former
affliction
had
its
charm
.
The
*NL*
room
was
most
dear
to
her
,
and
she
would
not
have
changed
its
furniture
*NL*
for
the
handsomest
in
the
house
,
though
what
had
been
originally
plain
*NL*
had
suffered
all
the
ill-usage
of
children
;
and
its
greatest
elegancies
*NL*
and
ornaments
were
a
faded
footstool
of
Julia
's
work
,
too
ill
done
*NL*
for
the
drawing-room
,
three
transparencies
,
made
in
a
rage
for
*NL*
transparencies
,
for
the
three
lower
panes
of
one
window
,
where
Tintern
*NL*
Abbey
held
its
station
between
a
cave
in
Italy
and
a
moonlight
lake
in
*NL*
Cumberland
,
a
collection
of
family
profiles
,
thought
unworthy
of
being
*NL*
anywhere
else
,
over
the
mantelpiece
,
and
by
their
side
,
and
pinned
*NL*
against
the
wall
,
a
small
sketch
of
a
ship
sent
four
years
ago
from
the
*NL*
Mediterranean
by
William
,
with
H.M.S.
Antwerp
at
the
bottom
,
in
letters
*NL*
as
tall
as
the
mainmast
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
this
nest
of
comforts
Fanny
now
walked
down
to
try
its
influence
on
*NL*
an
agitated
,
doubting
spirit
,
to
see
if
by
looking
at
Edmund
's
profile
*NL*
she
could
catch
any
of
his
counsel
,
or
by
giving
air
to
her
geraniums
*NL*
she
might
inhale
a
breeze
of
mental
strength
herself
.
But
she
had
more
*NL*
than
fears
of
her
own
perseverance
to
remove
:
she
had
begun
to
feel
*NL*
undecided
as
to
what
she
_
ought
_
_
to
_
_
do
_
;
and
as
she
walked
round
the
*NL*
room
her
doubts
were
increasing
.
Was
she
_
right
_
in
refusing
what
was
*NL*
so
warmly
asked
,
so
strongly
wished
for
--
what
might
be
so
essential
to
a
*NL*
scheme
on
which
some
of
those
to
whom
she
owed
the
greatest
complaisance
*NL*
had
set
their
hearts
?
Was
it
not
ill-nature
,
selfishness
,
and
a
fear
of
*NL*
exposing
herself
?
And
would
Edmund
's
judgment
,
would
his
persuasion
of
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
's
disapprobation
of
the
whole
,
be
enough
to
justify
her
in
a
*NL*
determined
denial
in
spite
of
all
the
rest
?
It
would
be
so
horrible
to
*NL*
her
to
act
that
she
was
inclined
to
suspect
the
truth
and
purity
of
her
*NL*
own
scruples
;
and
as
she
looked
around
her
,
the
claims
of
her
cousins
*NL*
to
being
obliged
were
strengthened
by
the
sight
of
present
upon
present
*NL*
that
she
had
received
from
them
.
The
table
between
the
windows
was
*NL*
covered
with
work-boxes
and
netting-boxes
which
had
been
given
her
at
*NL*
different
times
,
principally
by
Tom
;
and
she
grew
bewildered
as
to
the
*NL*
amount
of
the
debt
which
all
these
kind
remembrances
produced
.
A
tap
at
*NL*
the
door
roused
her
in
the
midst
of
this
attempt
to
find
her
way
to
her
*NL*
duty
,
and
her
gentle
``
Come
in
''
was
answered
by
the
appearance
of
one
,
*NL*
before
whom
all
her
doubts
were
wont
to
be
laid
.
Her
eyes
brightened
at
*NL*
the
sight
of
Edmund
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Can
I
speak
with
you
,
Fanny
,
for
a
few
minutes
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
certainly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
consult
.
I
want
your
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
opinion
!
''
she
cried
,
shrinking
from
such
a
compliment
,
highly
as
it
*NL*
gratified
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
your
advice
and
opinion
.
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
This
acting
*NL*
scheme
gets
worse
and
worse
,
you
see
.
They
have
chosen
almost
as
bad
a
*NL*
play
as
they
could
,
and
now
,
to
complete
the
business
,
are
going
to
ask
*NL*
the
help
of
a
young
man
very
slightly
known
to
any
of
us
.
This
is
the
*NL*
end
of
all
the
privacy
and
propriety
which
was
talked
about
at
first
.
*NL*
I
know
no
harm
of
Charles
Maddox
;
but
the
excessive
intimacy
which
*NL*
must
spring
from
his
being
admitted
among
us
in
this
manner
is
highly
*NL*
objectionable
,
the
_
more
_
than
intimacy
--
the
familiarity
.
I
can
not
*NL*
think
of
it
with
any
patience
;
and
it
does
appear
to
me
an
evil
of
such
*NL*
magnitude
as
must
,
_
if
_
_
possible
_
,
be
prevented
.
Do
not
you
see
it
in
*NL*
the
same
light
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
but
what
can
be
done
?
Your
brother
is
so
determined
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
There
is
but
_
one
_
thing
to
be
done
,
Fanny
.
I
must
take
Anhalt
myself

*NL*
I
am
well
aware
that
nothing
else
will
quiet
Tom

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
answer
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
not
at
all
what
I
like

''
he
continued
.
``
No
man
can
like
being
*NL*
driven
into
the
_
appearance

of
such
inconsistency

After
being
known
to

oppose
the
scheme
from
the
beginning
,
there
is
absurdity
in
the
face
of
*NL*
my
joining
them
_
now
_
,
when
they
are
exceeding
their
first
plan
in
every
*NL*
respect
;
but
I
can
think
of
no
other
alternative
.
Can
you
,
Fanny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Fanny
slowly
,
``
not
immediately
,
but
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
what
?
I
see
your
judgment
is
not
with
me

Think
it
a
little
over

Perhaps
you
are
not
so
much
aware
as
I
am
of
the
mischief
that
_
may
_
,
of
*NL*
the
unpleasantness
that
_
must
_
arise
from
a
young
man
's
being
received
*NL*
in
this
manner
:
domesticated
among
us
;
authorised
to
come
at
all
hours
,
*NL*
and
placed
suddenly
on
a
footing
which
must
do
away
all
restraints

To
*NL*
think
only
of
the
licence
which
every
rehearsal
must
tend
to
create

all
very
bad

Put
yourself
in
Miss
Crawford
's
place

Fanny

Consider
*NL*
what
it
would
be
to
act
Amelia
with
a
stranger
.
She
has
a
right
to
be
*NL*
felt
for
,
because
she
evidently
feels
for
herself

I
heard
enough
of
*NL*
what
she
said
to
you
last
night
to
understand
her
unwillingness
to
be
*NL*
acting
with
a
stranger
;
and
as
she
probably
engaged
in
the
part
with
*NL*
different
expectations
--
perhaps
without
considering
the
subject
enough
*NL*
to
know
what
was
likely
to
be
--
it
would
be
ungenerous
,
it
would
be
*NL*
really
wrong
to
expose
her
to
it
.
Her
feelings
ought
to
be
respected
.
*NL*
Does
it
not
strike
you
so
,
Fanny
?
You
hesitate

*NL*
``
I
am
sorry
for

what
you
had
resolved
against

and
what
you
are
known
to
think

will
be
disagreeable

triumph
there
certainly
will
be

I

I
can
do
nothing

I
have
*NL*
offended
them
,
and
they
will
not
hear
me
;
but
when
I
have
put
them
in
*NL*
good-humour
by
this
concession
,
I
am
not
without
hopes
of
persuading
*NL*
them
to
confine
the
representation
within
a
much
smaller
circle
than
*NL*
they
are
now
in
the
high
road
for
.
This
will
be
a
material
gain
.
My
*NL*
object
is
to
confine
it
to
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
the
Grants
.
Will
not
this
*NL*
be
worth
gaining
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
it
will
be
a
great
point
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
still
it
has
not
your
approbation

Can
you
mention
any
other

measure

which
I
have
a
chance
of
doing
equal
good
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
can

If
you

it
is

absolutely
impossible
to
let
Tom
go
on
in
this
way

about
the

of
anybody

can
be

act

to

Miss
Crawford

No

a
great
relief

Fanny
,
trying
for
greater
warmth
of
manner

*NL*
*NL*
``
She
never
appeared
more
amiable
than
in
her
behaviour

I
am
glad

have
her
spared

...
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
finish
the
generous
effusion
.
Her
conscience
stopt
her
in
*NL*
the
middle
,
but
Edmund
was
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
walk
down
immediately
after
breakfast

said
he
,
``
and
am
sure
*NL*
of
giving
pleasure
there

And
now
,
dear
Fanny

I
will
not
interrupt
you
*NL*
any
longer

You
want
to
be
reading

But
I
could
not
be
easy
till
I
had
*NL*
spoken
to
you

and
come
to
a
decision
.
Sleeping

waking

my
head
has
*NL*
been
full

this

all
night

It
is
an
evil

I
am
certainly

making
it
less
than
it
might
be

If
Tom

up

I
shall
go
to
him
*NL*
directly
and
get
it
over
,

when
we
meet
at
breakfast
we
shall
be
all
*NL*
in
high
good-humour
at
the
prospect
of
acting
the

together
with
*NL*
such
unanimity

_
You

,
in

be
taking
a

China

I
suppose

Lord
Macartney
go
on

opening
a
volume
on

the

then
taking
up
some
others
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
went
;
but
there
was
no
reading
,
no
China
,
no
composure
for
Fanny
.
He
*NL*
had
told
her
the
most
extraordinary
,
the
most
inconceivable
,
the
most
*NL*
unwelcome
news
;
and
she
could
think
of
nothing
else
.
To
be
acting
!
After
*NL*
all
his
objections
--
objections
so
just
and
so
public
!
After
all
that
she
*NL*
had
heard
him
say
,
and
seen
him
look
,
and
known
him
to
be
feeling
.
Could
*NL*
it
be
possible
?
Edmund
so
inconsistent
!
Was
he
not
deceiving
himself
?
*NL*
Was
he
not
wrong
?
Alas
!
it
was
all
Miss
Crawford
's
doing
.
She
had
seen
*NL*
her
influence
in
every
speech
,
and
was
miserable
.
The
doubts
and
alarms
*NL*
as
to
her
own
conduct
,
which
had
previously
distressed
her
,
and
*NL*
which
had
all
slept
while
she
listened
to
him
,
were
become
of
little
*NL*
consequence
now
.
This
deeper
anxiety
swallowed
them
up
.
Things
should
*NL*
take
their
course
;
she
cared
not
how
it
ended
.
Her
cousins
might
attack
,
*NL*
but
could
hardly
tease
her
.
She
was
beyond
their
reach
;
and
if
at
last
*NL*
obliged
to
yield
--
no
matter
--
it
was
all
misery
now
.

CHAPTER
XVII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
,
indeed
,
a
triumphant
day
to
Mr.
Bertram
and
Maria
.
Such
a
*NL*
victory
over
Edmund
's
discretion
had
been
beyond
their
hopes
,
and
was
*NL*
most
delightful
.
There
was
no
longer
anything
to
disturb
them
in
their
*NL*
darling
project
,
and
they
congratulated
each
other
in
private
on
the
*NL*
jealous
weakness
to
which
they
attributed
the
change
,
with
all
the
glee
*NL*
of
feelings
gratified
in
every
way
.
Edmund
might
still
look
grave
,
and
*NL*
say
he
did
not
like
the
scheme
in
general
,
and
must
disapprove
the
play
*NL*
in
particular
;
their
point
was
gained
:
he
was
to
act
,
and
he
was
driven
*NL*
to
it
by
the
force
of
selfish
inclinations
only
.
Edmund
had
descended
*NL*
from
that
moral
elevation
which
he
had
maintained
before
,
and
they
were
*NL*
both
as
much
the
better
as
the
happier
for
the
descent
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
behaved
very
well
,
however
,
to
_
him
_
on
the
occasion
,
betraying
no
*NL*
exultation
beyond
the
lines
about
the
corners
of
the
mouth
,
and
seemed
*NL*
to
think
it
as
great
an
escape
to
be
quit
of
the
intrusion
of
Charles
*NL*
Maddox
,
as
if
they
had
been
forced
into
admitting
him
against
their
*NL*
inclination
.
``
To
have
it
quite
in
their
own
family
circle
was
what
*NL*
they
had
particularly
wished
.
A
stranger
among
them
would
have
been
the
*NL*
destruction
of
all
their
comfort
''
;
and
when
Edmund
,
pursuing
that
idea
,
*NL*
gave
a
hint
of
his
hope
as
to
the
limitation
of
the
audience
,
they
were
*NL*
ready
,
in
the
complaisance
of
the
moment
,
to
promise
anything
.
It
was
*NL*
all
good-humour
and
encouragement
.
Mrs.
Norris
offered
to
contrive
his
*NL*
dress
,
Mr.
Yates
assured
him
that
Anhalt
's
last
scene
with
the
Baron
*NL*
admitted
a
good
deal
of
action
and
emphasis
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
undertook
*NL*
to
count
his
speeches
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
''
said
Tom
,
``
Fanny
may
be
more
disposed
to
oblige
us
now
.
*NL*
Perhaps
you
may
persuade
_
her
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
she
is
quite
determined
.
She
certainly
will
not
act
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
very
well
.
''
And
not
another
word
was
said
;
but
Fanny
felt
herself
*NL*
again
in
danger
,
and
her
indifference
to
the
danger
was
beginning
to
*NL*
fail
her
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
were
not
fewer
smiles
at
the
Parsonage
than
at
the
Park
on
this
*NL*
change
in
Edmund
;
Miss
Crawford
looked
very
lovely
in
hers
,
and
entered
*NL*
with
such
an
instantaneous
renewal
of
cheerfulness
into
the
whole
*NL*
affair
as
could
have
but
one
effect
on
him
.
``
He
was
certainly
right
in
*NL*
respecting
such
feelings
;
he
was
glad
he
had
determined
on
it
.
''
And
the
*NL*
morning
wore
away
in
satisfactions
very
sweet
,
if
not
very
sound
.
One
*NL*
advantage
resulted
from
it
to
Fanny
:
at
the
earnest
request
of
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
,
Mrs.
Grant
had
,
with
her
usual
good-humour
,
agreed
to
*NL*
undertake
the
part
for
which
Fanny
had
been
wanted
;
and
this
was
all
*NL*
that
occurred
to
gladden
_
her
_
heart
during
the
day
;
and
even
this
,
when
*NL*
imparted
by
Edmund
,
brought
a
pang
with
it
,
for
it
was
Miss
Crawford
to
*NL*
whom
she
was
obliged
--
it
was
Miss
Crawford
whose
kind
exertions
were
to
*NL*
excite
her
gratitude
,
and
whose
merit
in
making
them
was
spoken
of
*NL*
with
a
glow
of
admiration
.
She
was
safe
;
but
peace
and
safety
were
*NL*
unconnected
here
.
Her
mind
had
been
never
farther
from
peace
.
She
could
*NL*
not
feel
that
she
had
done
wrong
herself
,
but
she
was
disquieted
*NL*
in
every
other
way
.
Her
heart
and
her
judgment
were
equally
against
*NL*
Edmund
's
decision
:
she
could
not
acquit
his
unsteadiness
,
and
his
*NL*
happiness
under
it
made
her
wretched
.
She
was
full
of
jealousy
and
*NL*
agitation
.
Miss
Crawford
came
with
looks
of
gaiety
which
seemed
an
*NL*
insult
,
with
friendly
expressions
towards
herself
which
she
could
hardly
*NL*
answer
calmly
.
Everybody
around
her
was
gay
and
busy
,
prosperous
and
*NL*
important
;
each
had
their
object
of
interest
,
their
part
,
their
dress
,
*NL*
their
favourite
scene
,
their
friends
and
confederates
:
all
were
finding
*NL*
employment
in
consultations
and
comparisons
,
or
diversion
in
the
playful
*NL*
conceits
they
suggested
.
She
alone
was
sad
and
insignificant
:
she
had
*NL*
no
share
in
anything
;
she
might
go
or
stay
;
she
might
be
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
their
noise
,
or
retreat
from
it
to
the
solitude
of
the
East
room
,
*NL*
without
being
seen
or
missed
.
She
could
almost
think
anything
would
*NL*
have
been
preferable
to
this
.
Mrs.
Grant
was
of
consequence
:
_
her
_
*NL*
good-nature
had
honourable
mention
;
her
taste
and
her
time
were
*NL*
considered
;
her
presence
was
wanted
;
she
was
sought
for
,
and
attended
,
*NL*
and
praised
;
and
Fanny
was
at
first
in
some
danger
of
envying
her
the
*NL*
character
she
had
accepted
.
But
reflection
brought
better
feelings
,
and
*NL*
shewed
her
that
Mrs.
Grant
was
entitled
to
respect
,
which
could
never
*NL*
have
belonged
to
_
her
_
;
and
that
,
had
she
received
even
the
greatest
,
*NL*
she
could
never
have
been
easy
in
joining
a
scheme
which
,
considering
*NL*
only
her
uncle
,
she
must
condemn
altogether
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
heart
was
not
absolutely
the
only
saddened
one
amongst
them
,
*NL*
as
she
soon
began
to
acknowledge
to
herself
.
Julia
was
a
sufferer
too
,
*NL*
though
not
quite
so
blamelessly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Crawford
had
trifled
with
her
feelings
;
but
she
had
very
long
*NL*
allowed
and
even
sought
his
attentions
,
with
a
jealousy
of
her
sister
so
*NL*
reasonable
as
ought
to
have
been
their
cure
;
and
now
that
the
conviction
*NL*
of
his
preference
for
Maria
had
been
forced
on
her
,
she
submitted
to
it
*NL*
without
any
alarm
for
Maria
's
situation
,
or
any
endeavour
at
rational
*NL*
tranquillity
for
herself
.
She
either
sat
in
gloomy
silence
,
wrapt
in
*NL*
such
gravity
as
nothing
could
subdue
,
no
curiosity
touch
,
no
wit
amuse
;
*NL*
or
allowing
the
attentions
of
Mr.
Yates
,
was
talking
with
forced
gaiety
*NL*
to
him
alone
,
and
ridiculing
the
acting
of
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
a
day
or
two
after
the
affront
was
given
,
Henry
Crawford
had
*NL*
endeavoured
to
do
it
away
by
the
usual
attack
of
gallantry
and
*NL*
compliment
,
but
he
had
not
cared
enough
about
it
to
persevere
against
a
*NL*
few
repulses
;
and
becoming
soon
too
busy
with
his
play
to
have
time
for
*NL*
more
than
one
flirtation
,
he
grew
indifferent
to
the
quarrel
,
or
rather
*NL*
thought
it
a
lucky
occurrence
,
as
quietly
putting
an
end
to
what
might
*NL*
ere
long
have
raised
expectations
in
more
than
Mrs.
Grant
.
She
was
not
*NL*
pleased
to
see
Julia
excluded
from
the
play
,
and
sitting
by
disregarded
;
*NL*
but
as
it
was
not
a
matter
which
really
involved
her
happiness
,
as
Henry
*NL*
must
be
the
best
judge
of
his
own
,
and
as
he
did
assure
her
,
with
a
*NL*
most
persuasive
smile
,
that
neither
he
nor
Julia
had
ever
had
a
serious
*NL*
thought
of
each
other
,
she
could
only
renew
her
former
caution
as
to
*NL*
the
elder
sister
,
entreat
him
not
to
risk
his
tranquillity
by
too
*NL*
much
admiration
there
,
and
then
gladly
take
her
share
in
anything
that
*NL*
brought
cheerfulness
to
the
young
people
in
general
,
and
that
did
so
*NL*
particularly
promote
the
pleasure
of
the
two
so
dear
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
rather
wonder
Julia
is
not
in
love
with
Henry
,
''
was
her
observation
*NL*
to
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
dare
say
she
is
,
''
replied
Mary
coldly
.
``
I
imagine
both
sisters
are
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Both
!
no
,
no
,
that
must
not
be

Do
not

him
a

*NL*

You

good

I
often
think
of
Mr.

's
property
and
*NL*
independence
,
and
wish
them
in
other
hands

but
I
never
think
of
him

might
represent
the
county

such
an
estate

``

said

after
a
pause

``

return

*NL*
``
You
will
find
his
consequence
very
just
and
reasonable
when
you
see
him
*NL*
in
his
family
,
I
assure
you
.
I
do
not
think
we
do
so
well
without
him

*NL*
He
has
a
fine
dignified
manner
,
which
suits
the
head
of
such
a
house
,
*NL*
and
keeps
everybody
in
their
place

Lady
Bertram
seems
more
of
a
cipher

now
than
when
he
is
at
home
;
and
nobody
else
can
keep
Mrs.
Norris
in
*NL*
order

But
,
Mary
,
do
not
fancy
that
Maria
Bertram
cares
for
Henry

I
*NL*
am
sure
_
Julia
_
does
not
,
or
she
would
not
have
flirted
as
she
did
last
*NL*
night
with
Mr.
Yates
;
and
though
he
and
Maria
are
very
good
friends
,
I
*NL*
think
she
likes
Sotherton
too
well
to
be
inconstant

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
give
much
for
Mr.
Rushworth
's
chance

Henry
stept
in

signed

If

over

we
will
talk
to

seriously

make

own
mind

and
if

means
nothing
,
we
will
send
him
off

*NL*
is
Henry
,
for
a
time

''
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
_
did
_
suffer
,
however
,
though
Mrs.
Grant
discerned
it
not
,
and
*NL*
though
it
escaped
the
notice
of
many
of
her
own
family
likewise
.
She
had
*NL*
loved
,
she
did
love
still
,
and
she
had
all
the
suffering
which
a
warm
*NL*
temper
and
a
high
spirit
were
likely
to
endure
under
the
disappointment
*NL*
of
a
dear
,
though
irrational
hope
,
with
a
strong
sense
of
ill-usage
.
*NL*
Her
heart
was
sore
and
angry
,
and
she
was
capable
only
of
angry
*NL*
consolations
.
The
sister
with
whom
she
was
used
to
be
on
easy
terms
was
*NL*
now
become
her
greatest
enemy
:
they
were
alienated
from
each
other
;
*NL*
and
Julia
was
not
superior
to
the
hope
of
some
distressing
end
to
the
*NL*
attentions
which
were
still
carrying
on
there
,
some
punishment
to
*NL*
Maria
for
conduct
so
shameful
towards
herself
as
well
as
towards
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
.
With
no
material
fault
of
temper
,
or
difference
of
opinion
,
*NL*
to
prevent
their
being
very
good
friends
while
their
interests
were
*NL*
the
same
,
the
sisters
,
under
such
a
trial
as
this
,
had
not
affection
or
*NL*
principle
enough
to
make
them
merciful
or
just
,
to
give
them
honour
or
*NL*
compassion
.
Maria
felt
her
triumph
,
and
pursued
her
purpose
,
careless
of
*NL*
Julia
;
and
Julia
could
never
see
Maria
distinguished
by
Henry
Crawford
*NL*
without
trusting
that
it
would
create
jealousy
,
and
bring
a
public
*NL*
disturbance
at
last
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
saw
and
pitied
much
of
this
in
Julia
;
but
there
was
no
outward
*NL*
fellowship
between
them
.
Julia
made
no
communication
,
and
Fanny
took
*NL*
no
liberties
.
They
were
two
solitary
sufferers
,
or
connected
only
by
*NL*
Fanny
's
consciousness
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
inattention
of
the
two
brothers
and
the
aunt
to
Julia
's
*NL*
discomposure
,
and
their
blindness
to
its
true
cause
,
must
be
imputed
to
*NL*
the
fullness
of
their
own
minds
.
They
were
totally
preoccupied
.
Tom
was
*NL*
engrossed
by
the
concerns
of
his
theatre
,
and
saw
nothing
that
did
not
*NL*
immediately
relate
to
it
.
Edmund
,
between
his
theatrical
and
his
real
*NL*
part
,
between
Miss
Crawford
's
claims
and
his
own
conduct
,
between
love
*NL*
and
consistency
,
was
equally
unobservant
;
and
Mrs.
Norris
was
too
busy
*NL*
in
contriving
and
directing
the
general
little
matters
of
the
company
,
*NL*
superintending
their
various
dresses
with
economical
expedient
,
for
*NL*
which
nobody
thanked
her
,
and
saving
,
with
delighted
integrity
,
half
*NL*
a
crown
here
and
there
to
the
absent
Sir
Thomas
,
to
have
leisure
for
*NL*
watching
the
behaviour
,
or
guarding
the
happiness
of
his
daughters

CHAPTER
XVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
now
in
a
regular
train
:
theatre
,
actors
,
actresses
,
and
*NL*
dresses
,
were
all
getting
forward
;
but
though
no
other
great
impediments
*NL*
arose
,
Fanny
found
,
before
many
days
were
past
,
that
it
was
not
all
*NL*
uninterrupted
enjoyment
to
the
party
themselves
,
and
that
she
had
not
to
*NL*
witness
the
continuance
of
such
unanimity
and
delight
as
had
been
almost
*NL*
too
much
for
her
at
first
.
Everybody
began
to
have
their
vexation
.
*NL*
Edmund
had
many
.
Entirely
against
_
his
_
judgment
,
a
scene-painter
*NL*
arrived
from
town
,
and
was
at
work
,
much
to
the
increase
of
the
*NL*
expenses
,
and
,
what
was
worse
,
of
the
eclat
of
their
proceedings
;
and
*NL*
his
brother
,
instead
of
being
really
guided
by
him
as
to
the
privacy
of
*NL*
the
representation
,
was
giving
an
invitation
to
every
family
who
came
*NL*
in
his
way
.
Tom
himself
began
to
fret
over
the
scene-painter
's
slow
*NL*
progress
,
and
to
feel
the
miseries
of
waiting
.
He
had
learned
his
*NL*
part
--
all
his
parts
,
for
he
took
every
trifling
one
that
could
be
united
*NL*
with
the
Butler
,
and
began
to
be
impatient
to
be
acting
;
and
every
day
*NL*
thus
unemployed
was
tending
to
increase
his
sense
of
the
insignificance
*NL*
of
all
his
parts
together
,
and
make
him
more
ready
to
regret
that
some
*NL*
other
play
had
not
been
chosen
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
being
always
a
very
courteous
listener
,
and
often
the
only
*NL*
listener
at
hand
,
came
in
for
the
complaints
and
the
distresses
of
*NL*
most
of
them
.
_
She
_
knew
that
Mr.
Yates
was
in
general
thought
to
rant
*NL*
dreadfully
;
that
Mr.
Yates
was
disappointed
in
Henry
Crawford
;
that
*NL*
Tom
Bertram
spoke
so
quick
he
would
be
unintelligible
;
that
Mrs.
Grant
*NL*
spoiled
everything
by
laughing
;
that
Edmund
was
behindhand
with
his
*NL*
part
,
and
that
it
was
misery
to
have
anything
to
do
with
Mr.
Rushworth
,
*NL*
who
was
wanting
a
prompter
through
every
speech
.
She
knew
,
also
,
that
*NL*
poor
Mr.
Rushworth
could
seldom
get
anybody
to
rehearse
with
him
:
_
his
_
*NL*
complaint
came
before
her
as
well
as
the
rest
;
and
so
decided
to
her
*NL*
eye
was
her
cousin
Maria
's
avoidance
of
him
,
and
so
needlessly
often
the
*NL*
rehearsal
of
the
first
scene
between
her
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
that
she
had
*NL*
soon
all
the
terror
of
other
complaints
from
_
him
_
.
So
far
from
being
*NL*
all
satisfied
and
all
enjoying
,
she
found
everybody
requiring
something
*NL*
they
had
not
,
and
giving
occasion
of
discontent
to
the
others
.
Everybody
*NL*
had
a
part
either
too
long
or
too
short
;
nobody
would
attend
as
they
*NL*
ought
;
nobody
would
remember
on
which
side
they
were
to
come
in
;
nobody
*NL*
but
the
complainer
would
observe
any
directions
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
believed
herself
to
derive
as
much
innocent
enjoyment
from
the
*NL*
play
as
any
of
them
;
Henry
Crawford
acted
well
,
and
it
was
a
pleasure
to
*NL*
_
her
_
to
creep
into
the
theatre
,
and
attend
the
rehearsal
of
the
first
*NL*
act
,
in
spite
of
the
feelings
it
excited
in
some
speeches
for
Maria
.
*NL*
Maria
,
she
also
thought
,
acted
well
,
too
well
;
and
after
the
first
*NL*
rehearsal
or
two
,
Fanny
began
to
be
their
only
audience
;
and
sometimes
*NL*
as
prompter
,
sometimes
as
spectator
,
was
often
very
useful
.
As
far
as
*NL*
she
could
judge
,
Mr.
Crawford
was
considerably
the
best
actor
of
all
:
he
*NL*
had
more
confidence
than
Edmund
,
more
judgment
than
Tom
,
more
talent
and
*NL*
taste
than
Mr.
Yates
.
She
did
not
like
him
as
a
man
,
but
she
must
admit
*NL*
him
to
be
the
best
actor
,
and
on
this
point
there
were
not
many
who
*NL*
differed
from
her
.
Mr.
Yates
,
indeed
,
exclaimed
against
his
tameness
and
*NL*
insipidity
;
and
the
day
came
at
last
,
when
Mr.
Rushworth
turned
to
her
*NL*
with
a
black
look
,
and
said
,
``
Do
you
think
there
is
anything
so
very
*NL*
fine
in
all
this
?
For
the
life
and
soul
of
me
,
I
can
not
admire
him
;
and
,
*NL*
between
ourselves
,
to
see
such
an
undersized
,
little
,
mean-looking
man
,
*NL*
set
up
for
a
fine
actor
,
is
very
ridiculous
in
my
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
From
this
moment
there
was
a
return
of
his
former
jealousy
,
which
Maria
,
*NL*
from
increasing
hopes
of
Crawford
,
was
at
little
pains
to
remove
;
and
*NL*
the
chances
of
Mr.
Rushworth
's
ever
attaining
to
the
knowledge
of
his
*NL*
two-and-forty
speeches
became
much
less
.
As
to
his
ever
making
anything
*NL*
_
tolerable
_
of
them
,
nobody
had
the
smallest
idea
of
that
except
*NL*
his
mother
;
_
she
_
,
indeed
,
regretted
that
his
part
was
not
more
*NL*
considerable
,
and
deferred
coming
over
to
Mansfield
till
they
were
*NL*
forward
enough
in
their
rehearsal
to
comprehend
all
his
scenes
;
but
the
*NL*
others
aspired
at
nothing
beyond
his
remembering
the
catchword
,
and
the
*NL*
first
line
of
his
speech
,
and
being
able
to
follow
the
prompter
through
*NL*
the
rest
.
Fanny
,
in
her
pity
and
kindheartedness
,
was
at
great
pains
to
*NL*
teach
him
how
to
learn
,
giving
him
all
the
helps
and
directions
in
her
*NL*
power
,
trying
to
make
an
artificial
memory
for
him
,
and
learning
every
*NL*
word
of
his
part
herself
,
but
without
his
being
much
the
forwarder
.
*NL*
*NL*
Many
uncomfortable
,
anxious
,
apprehensive
feelings
she
certainly
had
;
*NL*
but
with
all
these
,
and
other
claims
on
her
time
and
attention
,
she
was
*NL*
as
far
from
finding
herself
without
employment
or
utility
amongst
them
,
*NL*
as
without
a
companion
in
uneasiness
;
quite
as
far
from
having
no
*NL*
demand
on
her
leisure
as
on
her
compassion
.
The
gloom
of
her
first
*NL*
anticipations
was
proved
to
have
been
unfounded
.
She
was
occasionally
*NL*
useful
to
all
;
she
was
perhaps
as
much
at
peace
as
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
great
deal
of
needlework
to
be
done
,
moreover
,
in
which
her
*NL*
help
was
wanted
;
and
that
Mrs.
Norris
thought
her
quite
as
well
off
*NL*
as
the
rest
,
was
evident
by
the
manner
in
which
she
claimed
it
--
``
Come
,
*NL*
Fanny
,
''
she
cried
,
``
these
are
fine
times
for
you
,
but
you
must
not
be
*NL*
always
walking
from
one
room
to
the
other
,
and
doing
the
lookings-on
at
*NL*
your
ease
,
in
this
way
;
I
want
you
here
.
I
have
been
slaving
myself
till
*NL*
I
can
hardly
stand
,
to
contrive
Mr.
Rushworth
's
cloak
without
sending
*NL*
for
any
more
satin
;
and
now
I
think
you
may
give
me
your
help
in
putting
*NL*
it
together
.
There
are
but
three
seams
;
you
may
do
them
in
a
trice
.
It
*NL*
would
be
lucky
for
me
if
I
had
nothing
but
the
executive
part
to
do
.
*NL*
_
You
_
are
best
off
,
I
can
tell
you
:
but
if
nobody
did
more
than
_
you
_
,
*NL*
we
should
not
get
on
very
fast
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
took
the
work
very
quietly
,
without
attempting
any
defence
;
but
*NL*
her
kinder
aunt
Bertram
observed
on
her
behalf
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
can
not
wonder
,
sister
,
that
Fanny
_
should
_
be
delighted
:
it
is
*NL*
all
new
to
her
,
you
know
;
you
and
I
used
to
be
very
fond
of
a
play
*NL*
ourselves
,
and
so
am
I
still
;
and
as
soon
as
I
am
a
little
more
at
*NL*
leisure
,
_
I
_
mean
to
look
in
at
their
rehearsals
too
.
What
is
the
play
*NL*
about
,
Fanny
?
you
have
never
told
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
sister
,
pray
do
not
ask
her
now
;
for
Fanny
is
not
one
of
those
who
*NL*
can
talk
and
work
at
the
same
time
.
It
is
about
Lovers
'
Vows
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
,
''
said
Fanny
to
her
aunt
Bertram
,
``
there
will
be
three
acts
*NL*
rehearsed
to-morrow
evening
,
and
that
will
give
you
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
seeing
all
the
actors
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
stay
till
the
curtain
is
hung
,
''
interposed
Mrs.
Norris
;
*NL*
``
the
curtain
will
be
hung
in
a
day
or
two
--
there
is
very
little
sense
in
*NL*
a
play
without
a
curtain
--
and
I
am
much
mistaken
if
you
do
not
find
it
*NL*
draw
up
into
very
handsome
festoons
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
seemed
quite
resigned
to
waiting
.
Fanny
did
not
share
her
*NL*
aunt
's
composure
:
she
thought
of
the
morrow
a
great
deal
,
for
if
the
*NL*
three
acts
were
rehearsed
,
Edmund
and
Miss
Crawford
would
then
be
acting
*NL*
together
for
the
first
time
;
the
third
act
would
bring
a
scene
between
*NL*
them
which
interested
her
most
particularly
,
and
which
she
was
longing
*NL*
and
dreading
to
see
how
they
would
perform
.
The
whole
subject
of
it
was
*NL*
love
--
a
marriage
of
love
was
to
be
described
by
the
gentleman
,
and
very
*NL*
little
short
of
a
declaration
of
love
be
made
by
the
lady
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
read
and
read
the
scene
again
with
many
painful
,
many
wondering
*NL*
emotions
,
and
looked
forward
to
their
representation
of
it
as
a
*NL*
circumstance
almost
too
interesting
.
She
did
not
_
believe
_
they
had
yet
*NL*
rehearsed
it
,
even
in
private
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
morrow
came
,
the
plan
for
the
evening
continued
,
and
Fanny
's
*NL*
consideration
of
it
did
not
become
less
agitated
.
She
worked
very
*NL*
diligently
under
her
aunt
's
directions
,
but
her
diligence
and
her
*NL*
silence
concealed
a
very
absent
,
anxious
mind
;
and
about
noon
she
*NL*
made
her
escape
with
her
work
to
the
East
room
,
that
she
might
have
no
*NL*
concern
in
another
,
and
,
as
she
deemed
it
,
most
unnecessary
rehearsal
of
*NL*
the
first
act
,
which
Henry
Crawford
was
just
proposing
,
desirous
at
*NL*
once
of
having
her
time
to
herself
,
and
of
avoiding
the
sight
of
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
.
A
glimpse
,
as
she
passed
through
the
hall
,
of
the
two
ladies
*NL*
walking
up
from
the
Parsonage
made
no
change
in
her
wish
of
retreat
,
and
*NL*
she
worked
and
meditated
in
the
East
room
,
undisturbed
,
for
a
quarter
of
*NL*
an
hour
,
when
a
gentle
tap
at
the
door
was
followed
by
the
entrance
of
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
right
?
Yes
;
this
is
the
East
room
.
My
dear
Miss
Price
,
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
,
but
I
have
made
my
way
to
you
on
purpose
to
entreat
your
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
quite
surprised
,
endeavoured
to
shew
herself
mistress
of
the
room
*NL*
by
her
civilities
,
and
looked
at
the
bright
bars
of
her
empty
grate
with
*NL*
concern
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
;
I
am
quite
warm
,
very
warm
.
Allow
me
to
stay
here
a
little
*NL*
while
,
and
do
have
the
goodness
to
hear
me
my
third
act
.
I
have
brought
*NL*
my
book
,
and
if
you
would
but
rehearse
it
with
me
,
I
should
be
_
so
_
*NL*
obliged
!
I
came
here
to-day
intending
to
rehearse
it
with
Edmund
--
by
*NL*
ourselves
--
against
the
evening
,
but
he
is
not
in
the
way
;
and
if
he
*NL*
_
were
_
,
I
do
not
think
I
could
go
through
it
with
_
him
_
,
till
I
have
*NL*
hardened
myself
a
little
;
for
really
there
is
a
speech
or
two
.
You
will
*NL*
be
so
good
,
wo
n't
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
most
civil
in
her
assurances
,
though
she
could
not
give
them
*NL*
in
a
very
steady
voice
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
you
ever
happened
to
look
at
the
part
I
mean
?
''
continued
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
,
opening
her
book
.
``
Here
it
is
.
I
did
not
think
much
of
it
at
*NL*
first
--
but
,
upon
my
word
.
There
,
look
at
_
that
_
speech
,
and
_
that
_
,
and
*NL*
_
that
_
.
How
am
I
ever
to
look
him
in
the
face
and
say
such
things
?
Could
*NL*
you
do
it
?
But
then
he
is
your
cousin
,
which
makes
all
the
difference
.
*NL*
You
must
rehearse
it
with
me
,
that
I
may
fancy
_
you
_
him
,
and
get
on
by
*NL*
degrees
.
You
_
have
_
a
look
of
_
his
_
sometimes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Have
I
?
I
will
do
my
best
with
the
greatest
readiness
;
but
I
must
*NL*
_
read
_
the
part
,
for
I
can
say
very
little
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
None
_
of
it
,
I
suppose
.
You
are
to
have
the
book
,
of
course
.
Now
for
*NL*
it
.
We
must
have
two
chairs
at
hand
for
you
to
bring
forward
to
the
*NL*
front
of
the
stage
.
There
--
very
good
school-room
chairs
,
not
made
for
a
*NL*
theatre
,
I
dare
say
;
much
more
fitted
for
little
girls
to
sit
and
kick
*NL*
their
feet
against
when
they
are
learning
a
lesson
.
What
would
your
*NL*
governess
and
your
uncle
say
to
see
them
used
for
such
a
purpose
?
Could
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
look
in
upon
us
just
now
,
he
would
bless
himself
,
for
we
*NL*
are
rehearsing
all
over
the
house
.
Yates
is
storming
away
in
the
*NL*
dining-room
.
I
heard
him
as
I
came
upstairs
,
and
the
theatre
is
engaged
*NL*
of
course
by
those
indefatigable
rehearsers
,
Agatha
and
Frederick
.
If
*NL*
_
they
_
are
not
perfect
,
I
_
shall
_
be
surprised
.
By
the
bye
,
I
looked
in
*NL*
upon
them
five
minutes
ago
,
and
it
happened
to
be
exactly
at
one
of
the
*NL*
times
when
they
were
trying
_
not
_
to
embrace
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
was
with
*NL*
me
.
I
thought
he
began
to
look
a
little
queer
,
so
I
turned
it
off
as
*NL*
well
as
I
could
,
by
whispering
to
him
,
`
We
shall
have
an
excellent
*NL*
Agatha
;
there
is
something
so
_
maternal
_
in
her
manner
,
so
completely
*NL*
_
maternal
_
in
her
voice
and
countenance
.
'
Was
not
that
well
done
of
me
?
*NL*
He
brightened
up
directly
.
Now
for
my
soliloquy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
began
,
and
Fanny
joined
in
with
all
the
modest
feeling
which
the
*NL*
idea
of
representing
Edmund
was
so
strongly
calculated
to
inspire
;
but
*NL*
with
looks
and
voice
so
truly
feminine
as
to
be
no
very
good
picture
of
*NL*
a
man
.
With
such
an
Anhalt
,
however
,
Miss
Crawford
had
courage
enough
;
*NL*
and
they
had
got
through
half
the
scene
,
when
a
tap
at
the
door
brought
*NL*
a
pause
,
and
the
entrance
of
Edmund
,
the
next
moment
,
suspended
it
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
Surprise
,
consciousness
,
and
pleasure
appeared
in
each
of
the
three
*NL*
on
this
unexpected
meeting
;
and
as
Edmund
was
come
on
the
very
same
*NL*
business
that
had
brought
Miss
Crawford
,
consciousness
and
pleasure
were
*NL*
likely
to
be
more
than
momentary
in
_
them
_
.
He
too
had
his
book
,
and
was
*NL*
seeking
Fanny
,
to
ask
her
to
rehearse
with
him
,
and
help
him
to
prepare
*NL*
for
the
evening
,
without
knowing
Miss
Crawford
to
be
in
the
house
;
*NL*
and
great
was
the
joy
and
animation
of
being
thus
thrown
together
,
of
*NL*
comparing
schemes
,
and
sympathising
in
praise
of
Fanny
's
kind
offices
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
She
_
could
not
equal
them
in
their
warmth
.
_
Her
_
spirits
sank
under
the
*NL*
glow
of
theirs
,
and
she
felt
herself
becoming
too
nearly
nothing
to
*NL*
both
to
have
any
comfort
in
having
been
sought
by
either
.
They
must
now
*NL*
rehearse
together
.
Edmund
proposed
,
urged
,
entreated
it
,
till
the
lady
,
*NL*
not
very
unwilling
at
first
,
could
refuse
no
longer
,
and
Fanny
was
*NL*
wanted
only
to
prompt
and
observe
them
.
She
was
invested
,
indeed
,
with
*NL*
the
office
of
judge
and
critic
,
and
earnestly
desired
to
exercise
it
and
*NL*
tell
them
all
their
faults
;
but
from
doing
so
every
feeling
within
her
*NL*
shrank
--
she
could
not
,
would
not
,
dared
not
attempt
it
:
had
she
been
*NL*
otherwise
qualified
for
criticism
,
her
conscience
must
have
restrained
*NL*
her
from
venturing
at
disapprobation
.
She
believed
herself
to
feel
too
*NL*
much
of
it
in
the
aggregate
for
honesty
or
safety
in
particulars
.
To
*NL*
prompt
them
must
be
enough
for
her
;
and
it
was
sometimes
_
more
_
than
*NL*
enough
;
for
she
could
not
always
pay
attention
to
the
book
.
In
watching
*NL*
them
she
forgot
herself
;
and
,
agitated
by
the
increasing
spirit
of
*NL*
Edmund
's
manner
,
had
once
closed
the
page
and
turned
away
exactly
as
he
*NL*
wanted
help
.
It
was
imputed
to
very
reasonable
weariness
,
and
she
was
*NL*
thanked
and
pitied
;
but
she
deserved
their
pity
more
than
she
hoped
they
*NL*
would
ever
surmise
.
At
last
the
scene
was
over
,
and
Fanny
forced
herself
*NL*
to
add
her
praise
to
the
compliments
each
was
giving
the
other
;
and
when
*NL*
again
alone
and
able
to
recall
the
whole
,
she
was
inclined
to
believe
*NL*
their
performance
would
,
indeed
,
have
such
nature
and
feeling
in
it
as
*NL*
must
ensure
their
credit
,
and
make
it
a
very
suffering
exhibition
to
*NL*
herself
.
Whatever
might
be
its
effect
,
however
,
she
must
stand
the
brunt
*NL*
of
it
again
that
very
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
regular
rehearsal
of
the
three
first
acts
was
certainly
to
*NL*
take
place
in
the
evening
:
Mrs.
Grant
and
the
Crawfords
were
engaged
to
*NL*
return
for
that
purpose
as
soon
as
they
could
after
dinner
;
and
every
*NL*
one
concerned
was
looking
forward
with
eagerness
.
There
seemed
a
general
*NL*
diffusion
of
cheerfulness
on
the
occasion
.
Tom
was
enjoying
such
an
*NL*
advance
towards
the
end
;
Edmund
was
in
spirits
from
the
morning
's
*NL*
rehearsal
,
and
little
vexations
seemed
everywhere
smoothed
away
.
All
*NL*
were
alert
and
impatient
;
the
ladies
moved
soon
,
the
gentlemen
soon
*NL*
followed
them
,
and
with
the
exception
of
Lady
Bertram
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
*NL*
Julia
,
everybody
was
in
the
theatre
at
an
early
hour
;
and
having
lighted
*NL*
it
up
as
well
as
its
unfinished
state
admitted
,
were
waiting
only
the
*NL*
arrival
of
Mrs.
Grant
and
the
Crawfords
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
did
not
wait
long
for
the
Crawfords
,
but
there
was
no
Mrs.
Grant
.
*NL*
She
could
not
come
.
Dr.
Grant
,
professing
an
indisposition
,
for
which
he
*NL*
had
little
credit
with
his
fair
sister-in-law
,
could
not
spare
his
wife
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dr.
Grant
is
ill
,
''
said
she
,
with
mock
solemnity
.
``
He
has
been
ill
ever
*NL*
since
he
did
not
eat
any
of
the
pheasant
today
.
He
fancied
it
tough
,
*NL*
sent
away
his
plate
,
and
has
been
suffering
ever
since
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
disappointment
!
Mrs.
Grant
's
non-attendance
was
sad
indeed
.
*NL*
Her
pleasant
manners
and
cheerful
conformity
made
her
always
valuable
*NL*
amongst
them
;
but
_
now
_
she
was
absolutely
necessary
.
They
could
not
*NL*
act
,
they
could
not
rehearse
with
any
satisfaction
without
her
.
The
*NL*
comfort
of
the
whole
evening
was
destroyed
.
What
was
to
be
done
?
Tom
,
as
*NL*
Cottager
,
was
in
despair
.
After
a
pause
of
perplexity
,
some
eyes
began
*NL*
to
be
turned
towards
Fanny
,
and
a
voice
or
two
to
say
,
``
If
Miss
Price
*NL*
would
be
so
good
as
to
_
read
_
the
part
.
''
She
was
immediately
surrounded
*NL*
by
supplications
;
everybody
asked
it
;
even
Edmund
said
,
``
Do
,
Fanny
,
if
*NL*
it
is
not
_
very
_
disagreeable
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fanny
still
hung
back
.
She
could
not
endure
the
idea
of
it
.
Why
was
*NL*
not
Miss
Crawford
to
be
applied
to
as
well
?
Or
why
had
not
she
rather
*NL*
gone
to
her
own
room
,
as
she
had
felt
to
be
safest
,
instead
of
attending
*NL*
the
rehearsal
at
all
?
She
had
known
it
would
irritate
and
distress
her
;
*NL*
she
had
known
it
her
duty
to
keep
away
.
She
was
properly
punished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
only
to
_
read
_
the
part
,
''
said
Henry
Crawford
,
with
renewed
*NL*
entreaty
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
do
believe
she
can
say
every
word
of
it
,
''
added
Maria
,
``
for
she
*NL*
could
put
Mrs.
Grant
right
the
other
day
in
twenty
places
.
Fanny
,
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
know
the
part
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
say
she
did
_
not
_
;
and
as
they
all
persevered
,
as
*NL*
Edmund
repeated
his
wish
,
and
with
a
look
of
even
fond
dependence
on
*NL*
her
good-nature
,
she
must
yield
.
She
would
do
her
best
.
Everybody
was
*NL*
satisfied
;
and
she
was
left
to
the
tremors
of
a
most
palpitating
heart
,
*NL*
while
the
others
prepared
to
begin
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
_
did
_
begin
;
and
being
too
much
engaged
in
their
own
noise
to
be
*NL*
struck
by
an
unusual
noise
in
the
other
part
of
the
house
,
had
proceeded
*NL*
some
way
when
the
door
of
the
room
was
thrown
open
,
and
Julia
,
appearing
*NL*
at
it
,
with
a
face
all
aghast
,
exclaimed
,
``
My
father
is
come
!
He
is
in
*NL*
the
hall
at
this
moment
.

CHAPTER
XIX
*NL*
*NL*
How
is
the
consternation
of
the
party
to
be
described
?
To
the
greater
*NL*
number
it
was
a
moment
of
absolute
horror
.
Sir
Thomas
in
the
house
!
All
*NL*
felt
the
instantaneous
conviction
.
Not
a
hope
of
imposition
or
mistake
*NL*
was
harboured
anywhere
.
Julia
's
looks
were
an
evidence
of
the
fact
that
*NL*
made
it
indisputable
;
and
after
the
first
starts
and
exclamations
,
not
a
*NL*
word
was
spoken
for
half
a
minute
:
each
with
an
altered
countenance
was
*NL*
looking
at
some
other
,
and
almost
each
was
feeling
it
a
stroke
the
most
*NL*
unwelcome
,
most
ill-timed
,
most
appalling
!
Mr.
Yates
might
consider
*NL*
it
only
as
a
vexatious
interruption
for
the
evening
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
might
imagine
it
a
blessing
;
but
every
other
heart
was
sinking
under
*NL*
some
degree
of
self-condemnation
or
undefined
alarm
,
every
other
heart
*NL*
was
suggesting
,
``
What
will
become
of
us
?
what
is
to
be
done
now
?
''
It
*NL*
was
a
terrible
pause
;
and
terrible
to
every
ear
were
the
corroborating
*NL*
sounds
of
opening
doors
and
passing
footsteps
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
was
the
first
to
move
and
speak
again
.
Jealousy
and
bitterness
*NL*
had
been
suspended
:
selfishness
was
lost
in
the
common
cause
;
but
at
the
*NL*
moment
of
her
appearance
,
Frederick
was
listening
with
looks
of
devotion
*NL*
to
Agatha
's
narrative
,
and
pressing
her
hand
to
his
heart
;
and
as
soon
*NL*
as
she
could
notice
this
,
and
see
that
,
in
spite
of
the
shock
of
her
*NL*
words
,
he
still
kept
his
station
and
retained
her
sister
's
hand
,
her
*NL*
wounded
heart
swelled
again
with
injury
,
and
looking
as
red
as
she
had
*NL*
been
white
before
,
she
turned
out
of
the
room
,
saying
,
''
_
I
_
need
not
be
*NL*
afraid
of
appearing
before
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
going
roused
the
rest
;
and
at
the
same
moment
the
two
brothers
*NL*
stepped
forward
,
feeling
the
necessity
of
doing
something
.
A
very
few
*NL*
words
between
them
were
sufficient
.
The
case
admitted
no
difference
of
*NL*
opinion
:
they
must
go
to
the
drawing-room
directly
.
Maria
joined
them
*NL*
with
the
same
intent
,
just
then
the
stoutest
of
the
three
;
for
the
*NL*
very
circumstance
which
had
driven
Julia
away
was
to
her
the
sweetest
*NL*
support
.
Henry
Crawford
's
retaining
her
hand
at
such
a
moment
,
a
moment
*NL*
of
such
peculiar
proof
and
importance
,
was
worth
ages
of
doubt
and
*NL*
anxiety
.
She
hailed
it
as
an
earnest
of
the
most
serious
determination
,
*NL*
and
was
equal
even
to
encounter
her
father
.
They
walked
off
,
utterly
*NL*
heedless
of
Mr.
Rushworth
's
repeated
question
of
,
``
Shall
I
go
too
?
Had
*NL*
not
I
better
go
too
?
Will
not
it
be
right
for
me
to
go
too
?
''
but
they
*NL*
were
no
sooner
through
the
door
than
Henry
Crawford
undertook
to
answer
*NL*
the
anxious
inquiry
,
and
,
encouraging
him
by
all
means
to
pay
his
*NL*
respects
to
Sir
Thomas
without
delay
,
sent
him
after
the
others
with
*NL*
delighted
haste
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
left
with
only
the
Crawfords
and
Mr.
Yates
.
She
had
been
quite
*NL*
overlooked
by
her
cousins
;
and
as
her
own
opinion
of
her
claims
on
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
's
affection
was
much
too
humble
to
give
her
any
idea
of
classing
*NL*
herself
with
his
children
,
she
was
glad
to
remain
behind
and
gain
a
*NL*
little
breathing-time
.
Her
agitation
and
alarm
exceeded
all
that
was
*NL*
endured
by
the
rest
,
by
the
right
of
a
disposition
which
not
even
*NL*
innocence
could
keep
from
suffering
.
She
was
nearly
fainting
:
all
her
*NL*
former
habitual
dread
of
her
uncle
was
returning
,
and
with
it
compassion
*NL*
for
him
and
for
almost
every
one
of
the
party
on
the
development
before
*NL*
him
,
with
solicitude
on
Edmund
's
account
indescribable
.
She
had
found
*NL*
a
seat
,
where
in
excessive
trembling
she
was
enduring
all
these
fearful
*NL*
thoughts
,
while
the
other
three
,
no
longer
under
any
restraint
,
were
*NL*
giving
vent
to
their
feelings
of
vexation
,
lamenting
over
such
an
*NL*
unlooked-for
premature
arrival
as
a
most
untoward
event
,
and
without
*NL*
mercy
wishing
poor
Sir
Thomas
had
been
twice
as
long
on
his
passage
,
or
*NL*
were
still
in
Antigua
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
Crawfords
were
more
warm
on
the
subject
than
Mr.
Yates
,
from
better
*NL*
understanding
the
family
,
and
judging
more
clearly
of
the
mischief
that
*NL*
must
ensue
.
The
ruin
of
the
play
was
to
them
a
certainty
:
they
felt
*NL*
the
total
destruction
of
the
scheme
to
be
inevitably
at
hand
;
while
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
considered
it
only
as
a
temporary
interruption
,
a
disaster
for
the
*NL*
evening
,
and
could
even
suggest
the
possibility
of
the
rehearsal
being
*NL*
renewed
after
tea
,
when
the
bustle
of
receiving
Sir
Thomas
were
over
,
*NL*
and
he
might
be
at
leisure
to
be
amused
by
it
.
The
Crawfords
laughed
*NL*
at
the
idea
;
and
having
soon
agreed
on
the
propriety
of
their
walking
*NL*
quietly
home
and
leaving
the
family
to
themselves
,
proposed
Mr.
Yates
's
*NL*
accompanying
them
and
spending
the
evening
at
the
Parsonage
.
But
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
,
having
never
been
with
those
who
thought
much
of
parental
claims
,
*NL*
or
family
confidence
,
could
not
perceive
that
anything
of
the
kind
was
*NL*
necessary
;
and
therefore
,
thanking
them
,
said
,
``
he
preferred
remaining
*NL*
where
he
was
,
that
he
might
pay
his
respects
to
the
old
gentleman
*NL*
handsomely
since
he
_
was
_
come
;
and
besides
,
he
did
not
think
it
would
*NL*
be
fair
by
the
others
to
have
everybody
run
away
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
just
beginning
to
collect
herself
,
and
to
feel
that
if
she
*NL*
staid
longer
behind
it
might
seem
disrespectful
,
when
this
point
was
*NL*
settled
,
and
being
commissioned
with
the
brother
and
sister
's
apology
,
*NL*
saw
them
preparing
to
go
as
she
quitted
the
room
herself
to
perform
the
*NL*
dreadful
duty
of
appearing
before
her
uncle
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
soon
did
she
find
herself
at
the
drawing-room
door
;
and
after
*NL*
pausing
a
moment
for
what
she
knew
would
not
come
,
for
a
courage
which
*NL*
the
outside
of
no
door
had
ever
supplied
to
her
,
she
turned
the
lock
in
*NL*
desperation
,
and
the
lights
of
the
drawing-room
,
and
all
the
collected
*NL*
family
,
were
before
her
.
As
she
entered
,
her
own
name
caught
her
ear
.
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
at
that
moment
looking
round
him
,
and
saying
,
``
But
where
*NL*
is
Fanny
?
Why
do
not
I
see
my
little
Fanny
?
''
--
and
on
perceiving
her
,
*NL*
came
forward
with
a
kindness
which
astonished
and
penetrated
her
,
*NL*
calling
her
his
dear
Fanny
,
kissing
her
affectionately
,
and
observing
*NL*
with
decided
pleasure
how
much
she
was
grown
!
Fanny
knew
not
how
to
*NL*
feel
,
nor
where
to
look
.
She
was
quite
oppressed
.
He
had
never
been
so
*NL*
kind
,
so
_
very
_
kind
to
her
in
his
life
.
His
manner
seemed
changed
,
his
*NL*
voice
was
quick
from
the
agitation
of
joy
;
and
all
that
had
been
awful
*NL*
in
his
dignity
seemed
lost
in
tenderness
.
He
led
her
nearer
the
light
*NL*
and
looked
at
her
again
--
inquired
particularly
after
her
health
,
and
*NL*
then
,
correcting
himself
,
observed
that
he
need
not
inquire
,
for
*NL*
her
appearance
spoke
sufficiently
on
that
point
.
A
fine
blush
having
*NL*
succeeded
the
previous
paleness
of
her
face
,
he
was
justified
in
his
*NL*
belief
of
her
equal
improvement
in
health
and
beauty
.
He
inquired
next
*NL*
after
her
family
,
especially
William
:
and
his
kindness
altogether
was
*NL*
such
as
made
her
reproach
herself
for
loving
him
so
little
,
and
thinking
*NL*
his
return
a
misfortune
;
and
when
,
on
having
courage
to
lift
her
eyes
to
*NL*
his
face
,
she
saw
that
he
was
grown
thinner
,
and
had
the
burnt
,
fagged
,
*NL*
worn
look
of
fatigue
and
a
hot
climate
,
every
tender
feeling
was
*NL*
increased
,
and
she
was
miserable
in
considering
how
much
unsuspected
*NL*
vexation
was
probably
ready
to
burst
on
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
indeed
the
life
of
the
party
,
who
at
his
suggestion
*NL*
now
seated
themselves
round
the
fire
.
He
had
the
best
right
to
be
the
*NL*
talker
;
and
the
delight
of
his
sensations
in
being
again
in
his
own
*NL*
house
,
in
the
centre
of
his
family
,
after
such
a
separation
,
made
him
*NL*
communicative
and
chatty
in
a
very
unusual
degree
;
and
he
was
ready
to
*NL*
give
every
information
as
to
his
voyage
,
and
answer
every
question
*NL*
of
his
two
sons
almost
before
it
was
put
.
His
business
in
Antigua
had
*NL*
latterly
been
prosperously
rapid
,
and
he
came
directly
from
Liverpool
,
*NL*
having
had
an
opportunity
of
making
his
passage
thither
in
a
private
*NL*
vessel
,
instead
of
waiting
for
the
packet
;
and
all
the
little
*NL*
particulars
of
his
proceedings
and
events
,
his
arrivals
and
departures
,
*NL*
were
most
promptly
delivered
,
as
he
sat
by
Lady
Bertram
and
looked
with
*NL*
heartfelt
satisfaction
on
the
faces
around
him
--
interrupting
himself
*NL*
more
than
once
,
however
,
to
remark
on
his
good
fortune
in
finding
them
*NL*
all
at
home
--
coming
unexpectedly
as
he
did
--
all
collected
together
*NL*
exactly
as
he
could
have
wished
,
but
dared
not
depend
on
.
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
was
not
forgotten
:
a
most
friendly
reception
and
warmth
of
hand-shaking
*NL*
had
already
met
him
,
and
with
pointed
attention
he
was
now
included
in
*NL*
the
objects
most
intimately
connected
with
Mansfield
.
There
was
nothing
*NL*
disagreeable
in
Mr.
Rushworth
's
appearance
,
and
Sir
Thomas
was
liking
*NL*
him
already
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
not
one
of
the
circle
was
he
listened
to
with
such
unbroken
,
*NL*
unalloyed
enjoyment
as
by
his
wife
,
who
was
really
extremely
happy
to
*NL*
see
him
,
and
whose
feelings
were
so
warmed
by
his
sudden
arrival
as
to
*NL*
place
her
nearer
agitation
than
she
had
been
for
the
last
twenty
years
.
*NL*
She
had
been
_
almost
_
fluttered
for
a
few
minutes
,
and
still
remained
so
*NL*
sensibly
animated
as
to
put
away
her
work
,
move
Pug
from
her
side
,
and
*NL*
give
all
her
attention
and
all
the
rest
of
her
sofa
to
her
husband
.
She
*NL*
had
no
anxieties
for
anybody
to
cloud
_
her
_
pleasure
:
her
own
time
had
*NL*
been
irreproachably
spent
during
his
absence
:
she
had
done
a
great
*NL*
deal
of
carpet-work
,
and
made
many
yards
of
fringe
;
and
she
would
have
*NL*
answered
as
freely
for
the
good
conduct
and
useful
pursuits
of
all
*NL*
the
young
people
as
for
her
own
.
It
was
so
agreeable
to
her
to
see
*NL*
him
again
,
and
hear
him
talk
,
to
have
her
ear
amused
and
her
whole
*NL*
comprehension
filled
by
his
narratives
,
that
she
began
particularly
*NL*
to
feel
how
dreadfully
she
must
have
missed
him
,
and
how
impossible
it
*NL*
would
have
been
for
her
to
bear
a
lengthened
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
was
by
no
means
to
be
compared
in
happiness
to
her
*NL*
sister
.
Not
that
_
she
_
was
incommoded
by
many
fears
of
Sir
Thomas
's
*NL*
disapprobation
when
the
present
state
of
his
house
should
be
known
,
for
*NL*
her
judgment
had
been
so
blinded
that
,
except
by
the
instinctive
caution
*NL*
with
which
she
had
whisked
away
Mr.
Rushworth
's
pink
satin
cloak
as
her
*NL*
brother-in-law
entered
,
she
could
hardly
be
said
to
shew
any
sign
of
*NL*
alarm
;
but
she
was
vexed
by
the
_
manner
_
of
his
return
.
It
had
left
her
*NL*
nothing
to
do
.
Instead
of
being
sent
for
out
of
the
room
,
and
seeing
*NL*
him
first
,
and
having
to
spread
the
happy
news
through
the
house
,
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
,
with
a
very
reasonable
dependence
,
perhaps
,
on
the
nerves
of
his
*NL*
wife
and
children
,
had
sought
no
confidant
but
the
butler
,
and
had
been
*NL*
following
him
almost
instantaneously
into
the
drawing-room
.
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
felt
herself
defrauded
of
an
office
on
which
she
had
always
depended
,
*NL*
whether
his
arrival
or
his
death
were
to
be
the
thing
unfolded
;
and
was
*NL*
now
trying
to
be
in
a
bustle
without
having
anything
to
bustle
about
,
*NL*
and
labouring
to
be
important
where
nothing
was
wanted
but
tranquillity
*NL*
and
silence
.
Would
Sir
Thomas
have
consented
to
eat
,
she
might
have
gone
*NL*
to
the
housekeeper
with
troublesome
directions
,
and
insulted
the
footmen
*NL*
with
injunctions
of
despatch
;
but
Sir
Thomas
resolutely
declined
all
*NL*
dinner
:
he
would
take
nothing
,
nothing
till
tea
came
--
he
would
rather
*NL*
wait
for
tea
.
Still
Mrs.
Norris
was
at
intervals
urging
something
*NL*
different
;
and
in
the
most
interesting
moment
of
his
passage
to
England
,
*NL*
when
the
alarm
of
a
French
privateer
was
at
the
height
,
she
burst
*NL*
through
his
recital
with
the
proposal
of
soup
.
``
Sure
,
my
dear
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
,
a
basin
of
soup
would
be
a
much
better
thing
for
you
than
tea
.
*NL*
Do
have
a
basin
of
soup
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
could
not
be
provoked
.
``
Still
the
same
anxiety
for
*NL*
everybody
's
comfort
,
my
dear
Mrs.
Norris
,
''
was
his
answer
.
``
But
indeed
I
*NL*
would
rather
have
nothing
but
tea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Lady
Bertram
,
suppose
you
speak
for
tea
directly
;
suppose
*NL*
you
hurry
Baddeley
a
little
;
he
seems
behindhand
to-night
.
''
She
carried
*NL*
this
point
,
and
Sir
Thomas
's
narrative
proceeded
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
there
was
a
pause
.
His
immediate
communications
were
*NL*
exhausted
,
and
it
seemed
enough
to
be
looking
joyfully
around
him
,
now
*NL*
at
one
,
now
at
another
of
the
beloved
circle
;
but
the
pause
was
not
*NL*
long
:
in
the
elation
of
her
spirits
Lady
Bertram
became
talkative
,
and
*NL*
what
were
the
sensations
of
her
children
upon
hearing
her
say
,
``
How
*NL*
do
you
think
the
young
people
have
been
amusing
themselves
lately
,
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
?
They
have
been
acting
.
We
have
been
all
alive
with
acting
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
and
what
have
you
been
acting
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
they
'll
tell
you
all
about
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
_
all
_
will
soon
be
told
,
''
cried
Tom
hastily
,
and
with
affected
*NL*
unconcern
;
``
but
it
is
not
worth
while
to
bore
my
father
with
it
now
.
You
*NL*
will
hear
enough
of
it
to-morrow
,
sir
.
We
have
just
been
trying
,
by
way
*NL*
of
doing
something
,
and
amusing
my
mother
,
just
within
the
last
week
,
*NL*
to
get
up
a
few
scenes
,
a
mere
trifle
.
We
have
had
such
incessant
rains
*NL*
almost
since
October
began
,
that
we
have
been
nearly
confined
to
the
*NL*
house
for
days
together
.
I
have
hardly
taken
out
a
gun
since
the
3rd
.
*NL*
Tolerable
sport
the
first
three
days
,
but
there
has
been
no
attempting
*NL*
anything
since
.
The
first
day
I
went
over
Mansfield
Wood
,
and
Edmund
*NL*
took
the
copses
beyond
Easton
,
and
we
brought
home
six
brace
between
*NL*
us
,
and
might
each
have
killed
six
times
as
many
,
but
we
respect
your
*NL*
pheasants
,
sir
,
I
assure
you
,
as
much
as
you
could
desire
.
I
do
not
*NL*
think
you
will
find
your
woods
by
any
means
worse
stocked
than
they
*NL*
were
.
_
I
_
never
saw
Mansfield
Wood
so
full
of
pheasants
in
my
life
*NL*
as
this
year
.
I
hope
you
will
take
a
day
's
sport
there
yourself
,
sir
,
*NL*
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
For
the
present
the
danger
was
over
,
and
Fanny
's
sick
feelings
subsided
;
*NL*
but
when
tea
was
soon
afterwards
brought
in
,
and
Sir
Thomas
,
getting
up
,
*NL*
said
that
he
found
that
he
could
not
be
any
longer
in
the
house
without
*NL*
just
looking
into
his
own
dear
room
,
every
agitation
was
returning
.
He
*NL*
was
gone
before
anything
had
been
said
to
prepare
him
for
the
change
he
*NL*
must
find
there
;
and
a
pause
of
alarm
followed
his
disappearance
.
Edmund
*NL*
was
the
first
to
speak
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Something
must
be
done
,
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
time
to
think
of
our
visitors
,
''
said
Maria
,
still
feeling
her
*NL*
hand
pressed
to
Henry
Crawford
's
heart
,
and
caring
little
for
anything
*NL*
else
.
``
Where
did
you
leave
Miss
Crawford
,
Fanny
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
told
of
their
departure
,
and
delivered
their
message
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
poor
Yates
is
all
alone
,
''
cried
Tom
.
``
I
will
go
and
fetch
him
.
He
*NL*
will
be
no
bad
assistant
when
it
all
comes
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
the
theatre
he
went
,
and
reached
it
just
in
time
to
witness
the
first
*NL*
meeting
of
his
father
and
his
friend
.
Sir
Thomas
had
been
a
good
deal
*NL*
surprised
to
find
candles
burning
in
his
room
;
and
on
casting
his
eye
*NL*
round
it
,
to
see
other
symptoms
of
recent
habitation
and
a
general
air
*NL*
of
confusion
in
the
furniture
.
The
removal
of
the
bookcase
from
before
*NL*
the
billiard-room
door
struck
him
especially
,
but
he
had
scarcely
more
*NL*
than
time
to
feel
astonished
at
all
this
,
before
there
were
sounds
from
*NL*
the
billiard-room
to
astonish
him
still
farther
.
Some
one
was
talking
*NL*
there
in
a
very
loud
accent
;
he
did
not
know
the
voice
--
more
than
*NL*
talking
--
almost
hallooing
.
He
stepped
to
the
door
,
rejoicing
at
that
*NL*
moment
in
having
the
means
of
immediate
communication
,
and
,
opening
it
,
*NL*
found
himself
on
the
stage
of
a
theatre
,
and
opposed
to
a
ranting
young
*NL*
man
,
who
appeared
likely
to
knock
him
down
backwards
.
At
the
very
moment
*NL*
of
Yates
perceiving
Sir
Thomas
,
and
giving
perhaps
the
very
best
start
*NL*
he
had
ever
given
in
the
whole
course
of
his
rehearsals
,
Tom
Bertram
*NL*
entered
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
;
and
never
had
he
found
greater
*NL*
difficulty
in
keeping
his
countenance
.
His
father
's
looks
of
solemnity
*NL*
and
amazement
on
this
his
first
appearance
on
any
stage
,
and
the
gradual
*NL*
metamorphosis
of
the
impassioned
Baron
Wildenheim
into
the
well-bred
and
*NL*
easy
Mr.
Yates
,
making
his
bow
and
apology
to
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
,
was
*NL*
such
an
exhibition
,
such
a
piece
of
true
acting
,
as
he
would
not
have
*NL*
lost
upon
any
account
.
It
would
be
the
last
--
in
all
probability
--
the
*NL*
last
scene
on
that
stage
;
but
he
was
sure
there
could
not
be
a
finer
.
*NL*
The
house
would
close
with
the
greatest
eclat
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
little
time
,
however
,
for
the
indulgence
of
any
images
of
*NL*
merriment
.
It
was
necessary
for
him
to
step
forward
,
too
,
and
assist
*NL*
the
introduction
,
and
with
many
awkward
sensations
he
did
his
best
.
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
received
Mr.
Yates
with
all
the
appearance
of
cordiality
which
*NL*
was
due
to
his
own
character
,
but
was
really
as
far
from
pleased
*NL*
with
the
necessity
of
the
acquaintance
as
with
the
manner
of
its
*NL*
commencement
.
Mr.
Yates
's
family
and
connexions
were
sufficiently
known
*NL*
to
him
to
render
his
introduction
as
the
``
particular
friend
,
''
another
of
*NL*
the
hundred
particular
friends
of
his
son
,
exceedingly
unwelcome
;
and
it
*NL*
needed
all
the
felicity
of
being
again
at
home
,
and
all
the
forbearance
*NL*
it
could
supply
,
to
save
Sir
Thomas
from
anger
on
finding
himself
thus
*NL*
bewildered
in
his
own
house
,
making
part
of
a
ridiculous
exhibition
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
theatrical
nonsense
,
and
forced
in
so
untoward
a
moment
to
*NL*
admit
the
acquaintance
of
a
young
man
whom
he
felt
sure
of
disapproving
,
*NL*
and
whose
easy
indifference
and
volubility
in
the
course
of
the
first
*NL*
five
minutes
seemed
to
mark
him
the
most
at
home
of
the
two
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
understood
his
father
's
thoughts
,
and
heartily
wishing
he
might
be
*NL*
always
as
well
disposed
to
give
them
but
partial
expression
,
began
to
*NL*
see
,
more
clearly
than
he
had
ever
done
before
,
that
there
might
be
some
*NL*
ground
of
offence
,
that
there
might
be
some
reason
for
the
glance
his
*NL*
father
gave
towards
the
ceiling
and
stucco
of
the
room
;
and
that
when
he
*NL*
inquired
with
mild
gravity
after
the
fate
of
the
billiard-table
,
he
was
*NL*
not
proceeding
beyond
a
very
allowable
curiosity
.
A
few
minutes
were
*NL*
enough
for
such
unsatisfactory
sensations
on
each
side
;
and
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
having
exerted
himself
so
far
as
to
speak
a
few
words
of
*NL*
calm
approbation
in
reply
to
an
eager
appeal
of
Mr.
Yates
,
as
to
the
*NL*
happiness
of
the
arrangement
,
the
three
gentlemen
returned
to
the
*NL*
drawing-room
together
,
Sir
Thomas
with
an
increase
of
gravity
which
was
*NL*
not
lost
on
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
your
theatre
,
''
said
he
composedly
,
as
he
sat
down
;
``
I
found
*NL*
myself
in
it
rather
unexpectedly
.
Its
vicinity
to
my
own
room
--
but
in
*NL*
every
respect
,
indeed
,
it
took
me
by
surprise
,
as
I
had
not
the
smallest
*NL*
suspicion
of
your
acting
having
assumed
so
serious
a
character
.
It
*NL*
appears
a
neat
job
,
however
,
as
far
as
I
could
judge
by
candlelight
,
*NL*
and
does
my
friend
Christopher
Jackson
credit
.
''
And
then
he
would
*NL*
have
changed
the
subject
,
and
sipped
his
coffee
in
peace
over
domestic
*NL*
matters
of
a
calmer
hue
;
but
Mr.
Yates
,
without
discernment
to
catch
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
's
meaning
,
or
diffidence
,
or
delicacy
,
or
discretion
enough
to
*NL*
allow
him
to
lead
the
discourse
while
he
mingled
among
the
others
with
*NL*
the
least
obtrusiveness
himself
,
would
keep
him
on
the
topic
of
the
*NL*
theatre
,
would
torment
him
with
questions
and
remarks
relative
to
it
,
*NL*
and
finally
would
make
him
hear
the
whole
history
of
his
disappointment
*NL*
at
Ecclesford
.
Sir
Thomas
listened
most
politely
,
but
found
much
to
*NL*
offend
his
ideas
of
decorum
,
and
confirm
his
ill-opinion
of
Mr.
Yates
's
*NL*
habits
of
thinking
,
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
the
story
;
and
when
*NL*
it
was
over
,
could
give
him
no
other
assurance
of
sympathy
than
what
a
*NL*
slight
bow
conveyed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
was
,
in
fact
,
the
origin
of
_
our
_
acting
,
''
said
Tom
,
after
*NL*
a
moment
's
thought
.
``
My
friend
Yates
brought
the
infection
from
*NL*
Ecclesford
,
and
it
spread
--
as
those
things
always
spread
,
you
know
,
*NL*
sir
--
the
faster
,
probably
,
from
_
your
_
having
so
often
encouraged
the
*NL*
sort
of
thing
in
us
formerly
.
It
was
like
treading
old
ground
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Yates
took
the
subject
from
his
friend
as
soon
as
possible
,
and
*NL*
immediately
gave
Sir
Thomas
an
account
of
what
they
had
done
and
were
*NL*
doing
:
told
him
of
the
gradual
increase
of
their
views
,
the
happy
*NL*
conclusion
of
their
first
difficulties
,
and
present
promising
state
of
*NL*
affairs
;
relating
everything
with
so
blind
an
interest
as
made
him
not
*NL*
only
totally
unconscious
of
the
uneasy
movements
of
many
of
his
*NL*
friends
as
they
sat
,
the
change
of
countenance
,
the
fidget
,
the
hem
!
of
*NL*
unquietness
,
but
prevented
him
even
from
seeing
the
expression
of
the
*NL*
face
on
which
his
own
eyes
were
fixed
--
from
seeing
Sir
Thomas
's
dark
*NL*
brow
contract
as
he
looked
with
inquiring
earnestness
at
his
daughters
*NL*
and
Edmund
,
dwelling
particularly
on
the
latter
,
and
speaking
a
*NL*
language
,
a
remonstrance
,
a
reproof
,
which
_
he
_
felt
at
his
heart
.
Not
*NL*
less
acutely
was
it
felt
by
Fanny
,
who
had
edged
back
her
chair
behind
*NL*
her
aunt
's
end
of
the
sofa
,
and
,
screened
from
notice
herself
,
saw
all
*NL*
that
was
passing
before
her
.
Such
a
look
of
reproach
at
Edmund
from
his
*NL*
father
she
could
never
have
expected
to
witness
;
and
to
feel
that
it
*NL*
was
in
any
degree
deserved
was
an
aggravation
indeed
.
Sir
Thomas
's
*NL*
look
implied
,
``
On
your
judgment
,
Edmund
,
I
depended
;
what
have
you
*NL*
been
about
?
''
She
knelt
in
spirit
to
her
uncle
,
and
her
bosom
swelled
to
*NL*
utter
,
``
Oh
,
not
to
_
him
_
!
Look
so
to
all
the
others
,
but
not
to
_
him
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Yates
was
still
talking
.
``
To
own
the
truth
,
Sir
Thomas
,
we
were
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
a
rehearsal
when
you
arrived
this
evening
.
We
were
going
*NL*
through
the
three
first
acts
,
and
not
unsuccessfully
upon
the
whole
.
Our
*NL*
company
is
now
so
dispersed
,
from
the
Crawfords
being
gone
home
,
that
*NL*
nothing
more
can
be
done
to-night
;
but
if
you
will
give
us
the
honour
of
*NL*
your
company
to-morrow
evening
,
I
should
not
be
afraid
of
the
result
.
We
*NL*
bespeak
your
indulgence
,
you
understand
,
as
young
performers
;
we
bespeak
*NL*
your
indulgence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
indulgence
shall
be
given
,
sir
,
''
replied
Sir
Thomas
gravely
,
``
but
*NL*
without
any
other
rehearsal
.
''
And
with
a
relenting
smile
,
he
added
,
``
I
*NL*
come
home
to
be
happy
and
indulgent
.
''
Then
turning
away
towards
any
*NL*
or
all
of
the
rest
,
he
tranquilly
said
,
``
Mr.
and
Miss
Crawford
were
*NL*
mentioned
in
my
last
letters
from
Mansfield
.
Do
you
find
them
agreeable
*NL*
acquaintance
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
was
the
only
one
at
all
ready
with
an
answer
,
but
he
being
entirely
*NL*
without
particular
regard
for
either
,
without
jealousy
either
in
love
*NL*
or
acting
,
could
speak
very
handsomely
of
both
.
``
Mr.
Crawford
was
a
*NL*
most
pleasant
,
gentleman-like
man
;
his
sister
a
sweet
,
pretty
,
elegant
,
*NL*
lively
girl
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
could
be
silent
no
longer
.
``
I
do
not
say
he
is
not
*NL*
gentleman-like
,
considering
;
but
you
should
tell
your
father
he
is
not
*NL*
above
five
feet
eight
,
or
he
will
be
expecting
a
well-looking
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
did
not
quite
understand
this
,
and
looked
with
some
surprise
*NL*
at
the
speaker
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
must
say
what
I
think
,
''
continued
Mr.
Rushworth
,
``
in
my
opinion
it
*NL*
is
very
disagreeable
to
be
always
rehearsing
.
It
is
having
too
much
of
a
*NL*
good
thing
.
I
am
not
so
fond
of
acting
as
I
was
at
first
.
I
think
we
are
*NL*
a
great
deal
better
employed
,
sitting
comfortably
here
among
ourselves
,
*NL*
and
doing
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
looked
again
,
and
then
replied
with
an
approving
smile
,
``
I
am
*NL*
happy
to
find
our
sentiments
on
this
subject
so
much
the
same
.
It
gives
*NL*
me
sincere
satisfaction
.
That
I
should
be
cautious
and
quick-sighted
,
*NL*
and
feel
many
scruples
which
my
children
do
_
not
_
feel
,
is
perfectly
*NL*
natural
;
and
equally
so
that
my
value
for
domestic
tranquillity
,
for
a
*NL*
home
which
shuts
out
noisy
pleasures
,
should
much
exceed
theirs
.
But
at
*NL*
your
time
of
life
to
feel
all
this
,
is
a
most
favourable
circumstance
*NL*
for
yourself
,
and
for
everybody
connected
with
you
;
and
I
am
sensible
of
*NL*
the
importance
of
having
an
ally
of
such
weight
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
meant
to
be
giving
Mr.
Rushworth
's
opinion
in
better
words
*NL*
than
he
could
find
himself
.
He
was
aware
that
he
must
not
expect
a
*NL*
genius
in
Mr.
Rushworth
;
but
as
a
well-judging
,
steady
young
man
,
with
*NL*
better
notions
than
his
elocution
would
do
justice
to
,
he
intended
to
*NL*
value
him
very
highly
.
It
was
impossible
for
many
of
the
others
not
to
*NL*
smile
.
Mr.
Rushworth
hardly
knew
what
to
do
with
so
much
meaning
;
but
by
*NL*
looking
,
as
he
really
felt
,
most
exceedingly
pleased
with
Sir
Thomas
's
*NL*
good
opinion
,
and
saying
scarcely
anything
,
he
did
his
best
towards
*NL*
preserving
that
good
opinion
a
little
longer
.

CHAPTER
XX
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
's
first
object
the
next
morning
was
to
see
his
father
alone
,
and
*NL*
give
him
a
fair
statement
of
the
whole
acting
scheme
,
defending
his
own
*NL*
share
in
it
as
far
only
as
he
could
then
,
in
a
soberer
moment
,
feel
his
*NL*
motives
to
deserve
,
and
acknowledging
,
with
perfect
ingenuousness
,
that
*NL*
his
concession
had
been
attended
with
such
partial
good
as
to
make
his
*NL*
judgment
in
it
very
doubtful
.
He
was
anxious
,
while
vindicating
himself
,
*NL*
to
say
nothing
unkind
of
the
others
:
but
there
was
only
one
amongst
*NL*
them
whose
conduct
he
could
mention
without
some
necessity
of
defence
*NL*
or
palliation
.
``
We
have
all
been
more
or
less
to
blame
,
''
said
he
,
``
every
*NL*
one
of
us
,
excepting
Fanny
.
Fanny
is
the
only
one
who
has
judged
rightly
*NL*
throughout
;
who
has
been
consistent
.
_
Her
_
feelings
have
been
steadily
*NL*
against
it
from
first
to
last
.
She
never
ceased
to
think
of
what
was
due
*NL*
to
you
.
You
will
find
Fanny
everything
you
could
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
saw
all
the
impropriety
of
such
a
scheme
among
such
a
party
,
*NL*
and
at
such
a
time
,
as
strongly
as
his
son
had
ever
supposed
he
must
;
he
*NL*
felt
it
too
much
,
indeed
,
for
many
words
;
and
having
shaken
hands
with
*NL*
Edmund
,
meant
to
try
to
lose
the
disagreeable
impression
,
and
forget
how
*NL*
much
he
had
been
forgotten
himself
as
soon
as
he
could
,
after
the
house
*NL*
had
been
cleared
of
every
object
enforcing
the
remembrance
,
and
restored
*NL*
to
its
proper
state
.
He
did
not
enter
into
any
remonstrance
with
his
*NL*
other
children
:
he
was
more
willing
to
believe
they
felt
their
error
*NL*
than
to
run
the
risk
of
investigation
.
The
reproof
of
an
immediate
*NL*
conclusion
of
everything
,
the
sweep
of
every
preparation
,
would
be
*NL*
sufficient
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
one
person
,
however
,
in
the
house
,
whom
he
could
not
leave
*NL*
to
learn
his
sentiments
merely
through
his
conduct
.
He
could
not
help
*NL*
giving
Mrs.
Norris
a
hint
of
his
having
hoped
that
her
advice
might
*NL*
have
been
interposed
to
prevent
what
her
judgment
must
certainly
have
*NL*
disapproved
.
The
young
people
had
been
very
inconsiderate
in
forming
the
*NL*
plan
;
they
ought
to
have
been
capable
of
a
better
decision
themselves
;
*NL*
but
they
were
young
;
and
,
excepting
Edmund
,
he
believed
,
of
unsteady
*NL*
characters
;
and
with
greater
surprise
,
therefore
,
he
must
regard
her
*NL*
acquiescence
in
their
wrong
measures
,
her
countenance
of
their
unsafe
*NL*
amusements
,
than
that
such
measures
and
such
amusements
should
have
*NL*
been
suggested
.
Mrs.
Norris
was
a
little
confounded
and
as
nearly
*NL*
being
silenced
as
ever
she
had
been
in
her
life
;
for
she
was
ashamed
to
*NL*
confess
having
never
seen
any
of
the
impropriety
which
was
so
glaring
*NL*
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
would
not
have
admitted
that
her
influence
was
*NL*
insufficient
--
that
she
might
have
talked
in
vain
.
Her
only
resource
was
*NL*
to
get
out
of
the
subject
as
fast
as
possible
,
and
turn
the
current
*NL*
of
Sir
Thomas
's
ideas
into
a
happier
channel
.
She
had
a
great
deal
to
*NL*
insinuate
in
her
own
praise
as
to
_
general
_
attention
to
the
interest
*NL*
and
comfort
of
his
family
,
much
exertion
and
many
sacrifices
to
glance
*NL*
at
in
the
form
of
hurried
walks
and
sudden
removals
from
her
own
*NL*
fireside
,
and
many
excellent
hints
of
distrust
and
economy
to
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
and
Edmund
to
detail
,
whereby
a
most
considerable
saving
had
*NL*
always
arisen
,
and
more
than
one
bad
servant
been
detected
.
But
her
*NL*
chief
strength
lay
in
Sotherton
.
Her
greatest
support
and
glory
was
*NL*
in
having
formed
the
connexion
with
the
Rushworths
.
_
There
_
she
*NL*
was
impregnable
.
She
took
to
herself
all
the
credit
of
bringing
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
admiration
of
Maria
to
any
effect
.
``
If
I
had
not
been
*NL*
active
,
''
said
she
,
``
and
made
a
point
of
being
introduced
to
his
mother
,
*NL*
and
then
prevailed
on
my
sister
to
pay
the
first
visit
,
I
am
as
certain
*NL*
as
I
sit
here
that
nothing
would
have
come
of
it
;
for
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
is
the
sort
of
amiable
modest
young
man
who
wants
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
encouragement
,
and
there
were
girls
enough
on
the
catch
for
him
if
we
*NL*
had
been
idle
.
But
I
left
no
stone
unturned
.
I
was
ready
to
move
heaven
*NL*
and
earth
to
persuade
my
sister
,
and
at
last
I
did
persuade
her
.
You
*NL*
know
the
distance
to
Sotherton
;
it
was
in
the
middle
of
winter
,
and
the
*NL*
roads
almost
impassable
,
but
I
did
persuade
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
how
great
,
how
justly
great
,
your
influence
is
with
Lady
Bertram
*NL*
and
her
children
,
and
am
the
more
concerned
that
it
should
not
have
*NL*
been
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
if
you
had
seen
the
state
of
the
roads
_
that
_
day
!
*NL*
I
thought
we
should
never
have
got
through
them
,
though
we
had
the
four
*NL*
horses
of
course
;
and
poor
old
coachman
would
attend
us
,
out
of
his
*NL*
great
love
and
kindness
,
though
he
was
hardly
able
to
sit
the
box
on
*NL*
account
of
the
rheumatism
which
I
had
been
doctoring
him
for
ever
since
*NL*
Michaelmas
.
I
cured
him
at
last
;
but
he
was
very
bad
all
the
winter
--
and
*NL*
this
was
such
a
day
,
I
could
not
help
going
to
him
up
in
his
room
before
*NL*
we
set
off
to
advise
him
not
to
venture
:
he
was
putting
on
his
wig
;
so
*NL*
I
said
,
`
Coachman
,
you
had
much
better
not
go
;
your
Lady
and
I
shall
be
*NL*
very
safe
;
you
know
how
steady
Stephen
is
,
and
Charles
has
been
upon
the
*NL*
leaders
so
often
now
,
that
I
am
sure
there
is
no
fear
.
'
But
,
however
,
I
*NL*
soon
found
it
would
not
do
;
he
was
bent
upon
going
,
and
as
I
hate
to
be
*NL*
worrying
and
officious
,
I
said
no
more
;
but
my
heart
quite
ached
for
him
*NL*
at
every
jolt
,
and
when
we
got
into
the
rough
lanes
about
Stoke
,
where
,
*NL*
what
with
frost
and
snow
upon
beds
of
stones
,
it
was
worse
than
anything
*NL*
you
can
imagine
,
I
was
quite
in
an
agony
about
him
.
And
then
the
poor
*NL*
horses
too
!
To
see
them
straining
away
!
You
know
how
I
always
feel
for
*NL*
the
horses
.
And
when
we
got
to
the
bottom
of
Sandcroft
Hill
,
what
do
you
*NL*
think
I
did
?
You
will
laugh
at
me
;
but
I
got
out
and
walked
up
.
I
did
*NL*
indeed
.
It
might
not
be
saving
them
much
,
but
it
was
something
,
and
I
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
sit
at
my
ease
and
be
dragged
up
at
the
expense
of
*NL*
those
noble
animals
.
I
caught
a
dreadful
cold
,
but
_
that
_
I
did
not
*NL*
regard
.
My
object
was
accomplished
in
the
visit
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
we
shall
always
think
the
acquaintance
worth
any
trouble
that
*NL*
might
be
taken
to
establish
it
.
There
is
nothing
very
striking
in
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
manners
,
but
I
was
pleased
last
night
with
what
appeared
to
*NL*
be
his
opinion
on
one
subject
:
his
decided
preference
of
a
quiet
family
*NL*
party
to
the
bustle
and
confusion
of
acting
.
He
seemed
to
feel
exactly
*NL*
as
one
could
wish
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
indeed
,
and
the
more
you
know
of
him
the
better
you
will
like
him
.
*NL*
He
is
not
a
shining
character
,
but
he
has
a
thousand
good
qualities
;
and
*NL*
is
so
disposed
to
look
up
to
you
,
that
I
am
quite
laughed
at
about
it
,
*NL*
for
everybody
considers
it
as
my
doing
.
`
Upon
my
word
,
Mrs.
Norris
,
'
*NL*
said
Mrs.
Grant
the
other
day
,
`
if
Mr.
Rushworth
were
a
son
of
your
own
,
*NL*
he
could
not
hold
Sir
Thomas
in
greater
respect
.
'
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
gave
up
the
point
,
foiled
by
her
evasions
,
disarmed
by
her
*NL*
flattery
;
and
was
obliged
to
rest
satisfied
with
the
conviction
that
*NL*
where
the
present
pleasure
of
those
she
loved
was
at
stake
,
her
kindness
*NL*
did
sometimes
overpower
her
judgment
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
busy
morning
with
him
.
Conversation
with
any
of
them
occupied
*NL*
but
a
small
part
of
it
.
He
had
to
reinstate
himself
in
all
the
wonted
*NL*
concerns
of
his
Mansfield
life
:
to
see
his
steward
and
his
bailiff
;
to
*NL*
examine
and
compute
,
and
,
in
the
intervals
of
business
,
to
walk
into
*NL*
his
stables
and
his
gardens
,
and
nearest
plantations
;
but
active
and
*NL*
methodical
,
he
had
not
only
done
all
this
before
he
resumed
his
seat
as
*NL*
master
of
the
house
at
dinner
,
he
had
also
set
the
carpenter
to
work
in
*NL*
pulling
down
what
had
been
so
lately
put
up
in
the
billiard-room
,
*NL*
and
given
the
scene-painter
his
dismissal
long
enough
to
justify
the
*NL*
pleasing
belief
of
his
being
then
at
least
as
far
off
as
Northampton
.
*NL*
The
scene-painter
was
gone
,
having
spoilt
only
the
floor
of
one
room
,
*NL*
ruined
all
the
coachman
's
sponges
,
and
made
five
of
the
under-servants
*NL*
idle
and
dissatisfied
;
and
Sir
Thomas
was
in
hopes
that
another
day
or
*NL*
two
would
suffice
to
wipe
away
every
outward
memento
of
what
had
been
,
*NL*
even
to
the
destruction
of
every
unbound
copy
of
Lovers
'
Vows
in
the
*NL*
house
,
for
he
was
burning
all
that
met
his
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Yates
was
beginning
now
to
understand
Sir
Thomas
's
intentions
,
*NL*
though
as
far
as
ever
from
understanding
their
source
.
He
and
his
friend
*NL*
had
been
out
with
their
guns
the
chief
of
the
morning
,
and
Tom
had
taken
*NL*
the
opportunity
of
explaining
,
with
proper
apologies
for
his
father
's
*NL*
particularity
,
what
was
to
be
expected
.
Mr.
Yates
felt
it
as
acutely
as
*NL*
might
be
supposed
.
To
be
a
second
time
disappointed
in
the
same
way
was
*NL*
an
instance
of
very
severe
ill-luck
;
and
his
indignation
was
such
,
*NL*
that
had
it
not
been
for
delicacy
towards
his
friend
,
and
his
friend
's
*NL*
youngest
sister
,
he
believed
he
should
certainly
attack
the
baronet
*NL*
on
the
absurdity
of
his
proceedings
,
and
argue
him
into
a
little
more
*NL*
rationality
.
He
believed
this
very
stoutly
while
he
was
in
Mansfield
*NL*
Wood
,
and
all
the
way
home
;
but
there
was
a
something
in
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
when
they
sat
round
the
same
table
,
which
made
Mr.
Yates
think
it
*NL*
wiser
to
let
him
pursue
his
own
way
,
and
feel
the
folly
of
it
without
*NL*
opposition
.
He
had
known
many
disagreeable
fathers
before
,
and
often
*NL*
been
struck
with
the
inconveniences
they
occasioned
,
but
never
,
in
*NL*
the
whole
course
of
his
life
,
had
he
seen
one
of
that
class
so
*NL*
unintelligibly
moral
,
so
infamously
tyrannical
as
Sir
Thomas
.
He
was
*NL*
not
a
man
to
be
endured
but
for
his
children
's
sake
,
and
he
might
be
*NL*
thankful
to
his
fair
daughter
Julia
that
Mr.
Yates
did
yet
mean
to
stay
*NL*
a
few
days
longer
under
his
roof
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
passed
with
external
smoothness
,
though
almost
every
*NL*
mind
was
ruffled
;
and
the
music
which
Sir
Thomas
called
for
from
his
*NL*
daughters
helped
to
conceal
the
want
of
real
harmony
.
Maria
was
in
a
*NL*
good
deal
of
agitation
.
It
was
of
the
utmost
consequence
to
her
that
*NL*
Crawford
should
now
lose
no
time
in
declaring
himself
,
and
she
was
*NL*
disturbed
that
even
a
day
should
be
gone
by
without
seeming
to
advance
*NL*
that
point
.
She
had
been
expecting
to
see
him
the
whole
morning
,
and
*NL*
all
the
evening
,
too
,
was
still
expecting
him
.
Mr.
Rushworth
had
set
off
*NL*
early
with
the
great
news
for
Sotherton
;
and
she
had
fondly
hoped
for
*NL*
such
an
immediate
_
eclaircissement
_
as
might
save
him
the
trouble
of
*NL*
ever
coming
back
again
.
But
they
had
seen
no
one
from
the
Parsonage
,
*NL*
not
a
creature
,
and
had
heard
no
tidings
beyond
a
friendly
note
of
*NL*
congratulation
and
inquiry
from
Mrs.
Grant
to
Lady
Bertram
.
It
was
the
*NL*
first
day
for
many
,
many
weeks
,
in
which
the
families
had
been
wholly
*NL*
divided
.
Four-and-twenty
hours
had
never
passed
before
,
since
August
*NL*
began
,
without
bringing
them
together
in
some
way
or
other
.
It
was
a
*NL*
sad
,
anxious
day
;
and
the
morrow
,
though
differing
in
the
sort
of
evil
,
*NL*
did
by
no
means
bring
less
.
A
few
moments
of
feverish
enjoyment
were
*NL*
followed
by
hours
of
acute
suffering
.
Henry
Crawford
was
again
in
the
*NL*
house
:
he
walked
up
with
Dr.
Grant
,
who
was
anxious
to
pay
his
respects
*NL*
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
at
rather
an
early
hour
they
were
ushered
into
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
,
where
were
most
of
the
family
.
Sir
Thomas
soon
appeared
,
*NL*
and
Maria
saw
with
delight
and
agitation
the
introduction
of
the
man
she
*NL*
loved
to
her
father
.
Her
sensations
were
indefinable
,
and
so
were
they
*NL*
a
few
minutes
afterwards
upon
hearing
Henry
Crawford
,
who
had
a
chair
*NL*
between
herself
and
Tom
,
ask
the
latter
in
an
undervoice
whether
*NL*
there
were
any
plans
for
resuming
the
play
after
the
present
happy
*NL*
interruption
-LRB-
with
a
courteous
glance
at
Sir
Thomas
-RRB-
,
because
,
in
that
*NL*
case
,
he
should
make
a
point
of
returning
to
Mansfield
at
any
time
*NL*
required
by
the
party
:
he
was
going
away
immediately
,
being
to
meet
his
*NL*
uncle
at
Bath
without
delay
;
but
if
there
were
any
prospect
of
a
renewal
*NL*
of
Lovers
'
Vows
,
he
should
hold
himself
positively
engaged
,
he
should
*NL*
break
through
every
other
claim
,
he
should
absolutely
condition
with
his
*NL*
uncle
for
attending
them
whenever
he
might
be
wanted
.
The
play
should
*NL*
not
be
lost
by
_
his
_
absence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
From
Bath
,
Norfolk
,
London
,
York
,
wherever
I
may
be
,
''
said
he
;
``
I
will
*NL*
attend
you
from
any
place
in
England
,
at
an
hour
's
notice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
well
at
that
moment
that
Tom
had
to
speak
,
and
not
his
sister
.
He
*NL*
could
immediately
say
with
easy
fluency
,
``
I
am
sorry
you
are
going
;
*NL*
but
as
to
our
play
,
_
that
_
is
all
over
--
entirely
at
an
end
''
-LRB-
looking
*NL*
significantly
at
his
father
-RRB-
.
``
The
painter
was
sent
off
yesterday
,
and
*NL*
very
little
will
remain
of
the
theatre
to-morrow
.
I
knew
how
_
that
_
*NL*
would
be
from
the
first
.
It
is
early
for
Bath
.
You
will
find
nobody
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
about
my
uncle
's
usual
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
do
you
think
of
going
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
may
,
perhaps
,
get
as
far
as
Banbury
to-day
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Whose
stables
do
you
use
at
Bath
?
''
was
the
next
question
;
and
while
*NL*
this
branch
of
the
subject
was
under
discussion
,
Maria
,
who
wanted
*NL*
neither
pride
nor
resolution
,
was
preparing
to
encounter
her
share
of
it
*NL*
with
tolerable
calmness
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
he
soon
turned
,
repeating
much
of
what
he
had
already
said
,
with
*NL*
only
a
softened
air
and
stronger
expressions
of
regret
.
But
what
availed
*NL*
his
expressions
or
his
air
?
He
was
going
,
and
,
if
not
voluntarily
going
,
*NL*
voluntarily
intending
to
stay
away
;
for
,
excepting
what
might
be
due
*NL*
to
his
uncle
,
his
engagements
were
all
self-imposed
.
He
might
talk
of
*NL*
necessity
,
but
she
knew
his
independence
.
The
hand
which
had
so
pressed
*NL*
hers
to
his
heart
!
the
hand
and
the
heart
were
alike
motionless
and
*NL*
passive
now
!
Her
spirit
supported
her
,
but
the
agony
of
her
mind
was
*NL*
severe
.
She
had
not
long
to
endure
what
arose
from
listening
to
language
*NL*
which
his
actions
contradicted
,
or
to
bury
the
tumult
of
her
feelings
*NL*
under
the
restraint
of
society
;
for
general
civilities
soon
called
*NL*
his
notice
from
her
,
and
the
farewell
visit
,
as
it
then
became
openly
*NL*
acknowledged
,
was
a
very
short
one
.
He
was
gone
--
he
had
touched
her
*NL*
hand
for
the
last
time
,
he
had
made
his
parting
bow
,
and
she
might
seek
*NL*
directly
all
that
solitude
could
do
for
her
.
Henry
Crawford
was
gone
,
*NL*
gone
from
the
house
,
and
within
two
hours
afterwards
from
the
parish
;
*NL*
and
so
ended
all
the
hopes
his
selfish
vanity
had
raised
in
Maria
and
*NL*
Julia
Bertram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
could
rejoice
that
he
was
gone
.
His
presence
was
beginning
to
be
*NL*
odious
to
her
;
and
if
Maria
gained
him
not
,
she
was
now
cool
enough
to
*NL*
dispense
with
any
other
revenge
.
She
did
not
want
exposure
to
be
added
*NL*
to
desertion
.
Henry
Crawford
gone
,
she
could
even
pity
her
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
a
purer
spirit
did
Fanny
rejoice
in
the
intelligence
.
She
heard
it
*NL*
at
dinner
,
and
felt
it
a
blessing
.
By
all
the
others
it
was
mentioned
*NL*
with
regret
;
and
his
merits
honoured
with
due
gradation
of
feeling
--
from
*NL*
the
sincerity
of
Edmund
's
too
partial
regard
,
to
the
unconcern
of
his
*NL*
mother
speaking
entirely
by
rote
.
Mrs.
Norris
began
to
look
about
her
,
*NL*
and
wonder
that
his
falling
in
love
with
Julia
had
come
to
nothing
;
and
*NL*
could
almost
fear
that
she
had
been
remiss
herself
in
forwarding
it
;
but
*NL*
with
so
many
to
care
for
,
how
was
it
possible
for
even
_
her
_
activity
to
*NL*
keep
pace
with
her
wishes
?
*NL*
*NL*
Another
day
or
two
,
and
Mr.
Yates
was
gone
likewise
.
In
_
his
_
departure
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
felt
the
chief
interest
:
wanting
to
be
alone
with
his
family
,
*NL*
the
presence
of
a
stranger
superior
to
Mr.
Yates
must
have
been
irksome
;
*NL*
but
of
him
,
trifling
and
confident
,
idle
and
expensive
,
it
was
every
way
*NL*
vexatious
.
In
himself
he
was
wearisome
,
but
as
the
friend
of
Tom
and
*NL*
the
admirer
of
Julia
he
became
offensive
.
Sir
Thomas
had
been
quite
*NL*
indifferent
to
Mr.
Crawford
's
going
or
staying
:
but
his
good
wishes
*NL*
for
Mr.
Yates
's
having
a
pleasant
journey
,
as
he
walked
with
him
to
the
*NL*
hall-door
,
were
given
with
genuine
satisfaction
.
Mr.
Yates
had
staid
to
*NL*
see
the
destruction
of
every
theatrical
preparation
at
Mansfield
,
the
*NL*
removal
of
everything
appertaining
to
the
play
:
he
left
the
house
in
all
*NL*
the
soberness
of
its
general
character
;
and
Sir
Thomas
hoped
,
in
seeing
*NL*
him
out
of
it
,
to
be
rid
of
the
worst
object
connected
with
the
scheme
,
*NL*
and
the
last
that
must
be
inevitably
reminding
him
of
its
existence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
contrived
to
remove
one
article
from
his
sight
that
might
*NL*
have
distressed
him
.
The
curtain
,
over
which
she
had
presided
with
such
*NL*
talent
and
such
success
,
went
off
with
her
to
her
cottage
,
where
she
*NL*
happened
to
be
particularly
in
want
of
green
baize
.

CHAPTER
XXI
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
's
return
made
a
striking
change
in
the
ways
of
the
family
,
*NL*
independent
of
Lovers
'
Vows
.
Under
his
government
,
Mansfield
was
an
*NL*
altered
place
.
Some
members
of
their
society
sent
away
,
and
the
spirits
*NL*
of
many
others
saddened
--
it
was
all
sameness
and
gloom
compared
with
*NL*
the
past
--
a
sombre
family
party
rarely
enlivened
.
There
was
little
*NL*
intercourse
with
the
Parsonage
.
Sir
Thomas
,
drawing
back
from
intimacies
*NL*
in
general
,
was
particularly
disinclined
,
at
this
time
,
for
any
*NL*
engagements
but
in
one
quarter
.
The
Rushworths
were
the
only
addition
to
*NL*
his
own
domestic
circle
which
he
could
solicit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
did
not
wonder
that
such
should
be
his
father
's
feelings
,
nor
*NL*
could
he
regret
anything
but
the
exclusion
of
the
Grants
.
``
But
they
,
''
he
*NL*
observed
to
Fanny
,
``
have
a
claim
.
They
seem
to
belong
to
us
;
they
seem
*NL*
to
be
part
of
ourselves
.
I
could
wish
my
father
were
more
sensible
of
*NL*
their
very
great
attention
to
my
mother
and
sisters
while
he
was
away
.
I
*NL*
am
afraid
they
may
feel
themselves
neglected
.
But
the
truth
is
,
that
my
*NL*
father
hardly
knows
them
.
They
had
not
been
here
a
twelvemonth
when
he
*NL*
left
England
.
If
he
knew
them
better
,
he
would
value
their
society
as
it
*NL*
deserves
;
for
they
are
in
fact
exactly
the
sort
of
people
he
would
*NL*
like
.
We
are
sometimes
a
little
in
want
of
animation
among
ourselves
:
my
*NL*
sisters
seem
out
of
spirits
,
and
Tom
is
certainly
not
at
his
ease
.
Dr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Grant
would
enliven
us
,
and
make
our
evenings
pass
away
with
*NL*
more
enjoyment
even
to
my
father
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
think
so
?
''
said
Fanny
:
``
in
my
opinion
,
my
uncle
would
not
like
*NL*
_
any
_
addition
.
I
think
he
values
the
very
quietness
you
speak
of
,
and
*NL*
that
the
repose
of
his
own
family
circle
is
all
he
wants
.
And
it
does
*NL*
not
appear
to
me
that
we
are
more
serious
than
we
used
to
be
--
I
mean
*NL*
before
my
uncle
went
abroad
.
As
well
as
I
can
recollect
,
it
was
always
*NL*
much
the
same
.
There
was
never
much
laughing
in
his
presence
;
or
,
if
*NL*
there
is
any
difference
,
it
is
not
more
,
I
think
,
than
such
an
absence
*NL*
has
a
tendency
to
produce
at
first
.
There
must
be
a
sort
of
shyness
;
but
*NL*
I
can
not
recollect
that
our
evenings
formerly
were
ever
merry
,
except
*NL*
when
my
uncle
was
in
town
.
No
young
people
's
are
,
I
suppose
,
when
those
*NL*
they
look
up
to
are
at
home
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
believe
you
are
right
,
Fanny
,
''
was
his
reply
,
after
a
short
*NL*
consideration
.
``
I
believe
our
evenings
are
rather
returned
to
what
they
*NL*
were
,
than
assuming
a
new
character
.
The
novelty
was
in
their
being
*NL*
lively
.
Yet
,
how
strong
the
impression
that
only
a
few
weeks
will
give
!
*NL*
I
have
been
feeling
as
if
we
had
never
lived
so
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
suppose
I
am
graver
than
other
people
,
''
said
Fanny
.
``
The
evenings
do
*NL*
not
appear
long
to
me
.
I
love
to
hear
my
uncle
talk
of
the
West
Indies
.
*NL*
I
could
listen
to
him
for
an
hour
together
.
It
entertains
_
me
_
more
than
*NL*
many
other
things
have
done
;
but
then
I
am
unlike
other
people
,
I
dare
*NL*
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
should
you
dare
say
_
that
_
?
''
-LRB-
smiling
-RRB-
.
``
Do
you
want
to
be
told
*NL*
that
you
are
only
unlike
other
people
in
being
more
wise
and
discreet
?
*NL*
But
when
did
you
,
or
anybody
,
ever
get
a
compliment
from
me
,
Fanny
?
Go
*NL*
to
my
father
if
you
want
to
be
complimented
.
He
will
satisfy
you
.
Ask
*NL*
your
uncle
what
he
thinks
,
and
you
will
hear
compliments
enough
:
and
*NL*
though
they
may
be
chiefly
on
your
person
,
you
must
put
up
with
it
,
and
*NL*
trust
to
his
seeing
as
much
beauty
of
mind
in
time
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
language
was
so
new
to
Fanny
that
it
quite
embarrassed
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
uncle
thinks
you
very
pretty
,
dear
Fanny
--
and
that
is
the
long
and
*NL*
the
short
of
the
matter
.
Anybody
but
myself
would
have
made
something
*NL*
more
of
it
,
and
anybody
but
you
would
resent
that
you
had
not
been
*NL*
thought
very
pretty
before
;
but
the
truth
is
,
that
your
uncle
never
*NL*
did
admire
you
till
now
--
and
now
he
does
.
Your
complexion
is
so
*NL*
improved
!
--
and
you
have
gained
so
much
countenance
!
--
and
your
*NL*
figure
--
nay
,
Fanny
,
do
not
turn
away
about
it
--
it
is
but
an
uncle
.
If
*NL*
you
can
not
bear
an
uncle
's
admiration
,
what
is
to
become
of
you
?
You
*NL*
must
really
begin
to
harden
yourself
to
the
idea
of
being
worth
looking
*NL*
at
.
You
must
try
not
to
mind
growing
up
into
a
pretty
woman
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
do
n't
talk
so
,
do
n't
talk
so
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
distressed
by
more
*NL*
feelings
than
he
was
aware
of
;
but
seeing
that
she
was
distressed
,
he
*NL*
had
done
with
the
subject
,
and
only
added
more
seriously
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
uncle
is
disposed
to
be
pleased
with
you
in
every
respect
;
and
I
*NL*
only
wish
you
would
talk
to
him
more
.
You
are
one
of
those
who
are
too
*NL*
silent
in
the
evening
circle
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
do
talk
to
him
more
than
I
used
.
I
am
sure
I
do

Did
not
you
hear
*NL*
me
ask
him
about
the
slave-trade
last
night
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
--
and
was
in
hopes
the
question
would
be
followed
up
by
others

It
*NL*
would
have
pleased
your
uncle
to
be
inquired
of
farther
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
longed
to
do
it
--
but
there
was
such
a
dead
silence
!
And
while
*NL*
my
cousins
were
sitting
by
without
speaking
a
word
,
or
seeming
at
all
*NL*
interested
in
the
subject
,
I
did
not
like
--
I
thought
it
would
appear
as
*NL*
if
I
wanted
to
set
myself
off
at
their
expense
,
by
shewing
a
curiosity
*NL*
and
pleasure
in
his
information
which
he
must
wish
his
own
daughters
to
*NL*
feel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Miss
Crawford
was
very
right
in
what
she
said
of
you
the
other
day
:
*NL*
that
you
seemed
almost
as
fearful
of
notice
and
praise
as
other
women
*NL*
were
of
neglect
.
We
were
talking
of
you
at
the
Parsonage
,
and
those
were
*NL*
her
words
.
She
has
great
discernment
.
I
know
nobody
who
distinguishes
*NL*
characters
better
.
For
so
young
a
woman
it
is
remarkable
!
She
certainly
*NL*
understands
_
you
_
better
than
you
are
understood
by
the
greater
part
of
*NL*
those
who
have
known
you
so
long
;
and
with
regard
to
some
others
,
I
can
*NL*
perceive
,
from
occasional
lively
hints
,
the
unguarded
expressions
of
*NL*
the
moment
,
that
she
could
define
_
many
_
as
accurately
,
did
not
delicacy
*NL*
forbid
it
.
I
wonder
what
she
thinks
of
my
father
!
She
must
admire
him
*NL*
as
a
fine-looking
man
,
with
most
gentlemanlike
,
dignified
,
consistent
*NL*
manners
;
but
perhaps
,
having
seen
him
so
seldom
,
his
reserve
may
be
*NL*
a
little
repulsive
.
Could
they
be
much
together
,
I
feel
sure
of
their
*NL*
liking
each
other
.
He
would
enjoy
her
liveliness
and
she
has
talents
to
*NL*
value
his
powers
.
I
wish
they
met
more
frequently
!
I
hope
she
does
not
*NL*
suppose
there
is
any
dislike
on
his
side
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
know
herself
too
secure
of
the
regard

all
the
rest
of
you

''
*NL*
said
Fanny
,
with
half
a
sigh
,
``
to
have
any
such
apprehension

And
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
's
wishing
just
at
first
to
be
only
with
his
family
,
is
so
very
*NL*
natural
,
that
she
can
argue
nothing
from
that
.
After
a
little
while
,
I
*NL*
dare
say
,
we
shall
be
meeting
again
in
the

sort
of
way

for
the

This

the

infancy

I
do
not
call
Tunbridge
or
Cheltenham
the
country

and
November
*NL*
is
a
still
more
serious
month
,
and
I
can
see
that
Mrs.

is
very
*NL*
anxious
for
her
not
finding
Mansfield
dull
as
winter
comes
on

*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
have
said
a
great
deal

it
was
safer
to
say
nothing

*NL*
leave
untouched
all
Miss
Crawford
's
resources

her
accomplishments

her
*NL*
spirits
,
her
importance
,
her
friends

lest
it
should
betray
her
into
*NL*
any
observations
seemingly
unhandsome

Miss
Crawford
's
kind
opinion
of

herself
deserved
at
least
a
grateful
forbearance

she
began
to
talk

something
else

dines

the
stupidity
of
the
day
,
if
there
were
not
a
much
greater
evil
to
*NL*
follow
--
the
impression
it
must
leave
on
Sir
Thomas
.
He
can
not
much
*NL*
longer
deceive
himself
.
I
am
sorry
for
them
all
,
and
would
give
*NL*
something
that
Rushworth
and
Maria
had
never
met
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
quarter
,
indeed
,
disappointment
was
impending
over
Sir
Thomas
.
*NL*
Not
all
his
good-will
for
Mr.
Rushworth
,
not
all
Mr.
Rushworth
's
*NL*
deference
for
him
,
could
prevent
him
from
soon
discerning
some
part
of
*NL*
the
truth
--
that
Mr.
Rushworth
was
an
inferior
young
man
,
as
ignorant
*NL*
in
business
as
in
books
,
with
opinions
in
general
unfixed
,
and
without
*NL*
seeming
much
aware
of
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
expected
a
very
different
son-in-law
;
and
beginning
to
feel
*NL*
grave
on
Maria
's
account
,
tried
to
understand
_
her
_
feelings
.
Little
*NL*
observation
there
was
necessary
to
tell
him
that
indifference
was
the
*NL*
most
favourable
state
they
could
be
in
.
Her
behaviour
to
Mr.
Rushworth
*NL*
was
careless
and
cold
.
She
could
not
,
did
not
like
him
.
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
resolved
to
speak
seriously
to
her
.
Advantageous
as
would
be
the
*NL*
alliance
,
and
long
standing
and
public
as
was
the
engagement
,
her
*NL*
happiness
must
not
be
sacrificed
to
it
.
Mr.
Rushworth
had
,
perhaps
,
been
*NL*
accepted
on
too
short
an
acquaintance
,
and
,
on
knowing
him
better
,
she
*NL*
was
repenting
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
solemn
kindness
Sir
Thomas
addressed
her
:
told
her
his
fears
,
*NL*
inquired
into
her
wishes
,
entreated
her
to
be
open
and
sincere
,
and
*NL*
assured
her
that
every
inconvenience
should
be
braved
,
and
the
connexion
*NL*
entirely
given
up
,
if
she
felt
herself
unhappy
in
the
prospect
of
it
.
He
*NL*
would
act
for
her
and
release
her
.
Maria
had
a
moment
's
struggle
as
she
*NL*
listened
,
and
only
a
moment
's
:
when
her
father
ceased
,
she
was
able
to
*NL*
give
her
answer
immediately
,
decidedly
,
and
with
no
apparent
agitation
.
*NL*
She
thanked
him
for
his
great
attention
,
his
paternal
kindness
,
but
he
*NL*
was
quite
mistaken
in
supposing
she
had
the
smallest
desire
of
breaking
*NL*
through
her
engagement
,
or
was
sensible
of
any
change
of
opinion
or
*NL*
inclination
since
her
forming
it
.
She
had
the
highest
esteem
for
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
character
and
disposition
,
and
could
not
have
a
doubt
of
her
*NL*
happiness
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
satisfied
;
too
glad
to
be
satisfied
,
perhaps
,
to
urge
the
*NL*
matter
quite
so
far
as
his
judgment
might
have
dictated
to
others
.
It
*NL*
was
an
alliance
which
he
could
not
have
relinquished
without
pain
;
*NL*
and
thus
he
reasoned
.
Mr.
Rushworth
was
young
enough
to
improve
.
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
must
and
would
improve
in
good
society
;
and
if
Maria
could
now
*NL*
speak
so
securely
of
her
happiness
with
him
,
speaking
certainly
without
*NL*
the
prejudice
,
the
blindness
of
love
,
she
ought
to
be
believed
.
Her
*NL*
feelings
,
probably
,
were
not
acute
;
he
had
never
supposed
them
to
be
*NL*
so
;
but
her
comforts
might
not
be
less
on
that
account
;
and
if
she
could
*NL*
dispense
with
seeing
her
husband
a
leading
,
shining
character
,
there
*NL*
would
certainly
be
everything
else
in
her
favour
.
A
well-disposed
young
*NL*
woman
,
who
did
not
marry
for
love
,
was
in
general
but
the
more
attached
*NL*
to
her
own
family
;
and
the
nearness
of
Sotherton
to
Mansfield
*NL*
must
naturally
hold
out
the
greatest
temptation
,
and
would
,
in
all
*NL*
probability
,
be
a
continual
supply
of
the
most
amiable
and
innocent
*NL*
enjoyments
.
Such
and
such-like
were
the
reasonings
of
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
happy
to
escape
the
embarrassing
evils
of
a
rupture
,
the
wonder
,
*NL*
the
reflections
,
the
reproach
that
must
attend
it
;
happy
to
secure
a
*NL*
marriage
which
would
bring
him
such
an
addition
of
respectability
*NL*
and
influence
,
and
very
happy
to
think
anything
of
his
daughter
's
*NL*
disposition
that
was
most
favourable
for
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
her
the
conference
closed
as
satisfactorily
as
to
him
.
She
was
in
a
*NL*
state
of
mind
to
be
glad
that
she
had
secured
her
fate
beyond
recall
:
*NL*
that
she
had
pledged
herself
anew
to
Sotherton
;
that
she
was
safe
from
*NL*
the
possibility
of
giving
Crawford
the
triumph
of
governing
her
actions
,
*NL*
and
destroying
her
prospects
;
and
retired
in
proud
resolve
,
determined
*NL*
only
to
behave
more
cautiously
to
Mr.
Rushworth
in
future
,
that
her
*NL*
father
might
not
be
again
suspecting
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Sir
Thomas
applied
to
his
daughter
within
the
first
three
or
four
*NL*
days
after
Henry
Crawford
's
leaving
Mansfield
,
before
her
feelings
were
*NL*
at
all
tranquillised
,
before
she
had
given
up
every
hope
of
him
,
or
*NL*
absolutely
resolved
on
enduring
his
rival
,
her
answer
might
have
been
*NL*
different
;
but
after
another
three
or
four
days
,
when
there
was
no
*NL*
return
,
no
letter
,
no
message
,
no
symptom
of
a
softened
heart
,
no
hope
*NL*
of
advantage
from
separation
,
her
mind
became
cool
enough
to
seek
all
*NL*
the
comfort
that
pride
and
self
revenge
could
give
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Crawford
had
destroyed
her
happiness
,
but
he
should
not
know
that
*NL*
he
had
done
it
;
he
should
not
destroy
her
credit
,
her
appearance
,
her
*NL*
prosperity
,
too
.
He
should
not
have
to
think
of
her
as
pining
in
the
*NL*
retirement
of
Mansfield
for
_
him
_
,
rejecting
Sotherton
and
London
,
*NL*
independence
and
splendour
,
for
_
his
_
sake
.
Independence
was
more
*NL*
needful
than
ever
;
the
want
of
it
at
Mansfield
more
sensibly
felt
.
She
*NL*
was
less
and
less
able
to
endure
the
restraint
which
her
father
imposed
.
*NL*
The
liberty
which
his
absence
had
given
was
now
become
absolutely
*NL*
necessary
.
She
must
escape
from
him
and
Mansfield
as
soon
as
possible
,
*NL*
and
find
consolation
in
fortune
and
consequence
,
bustle
and
the
world
,
*NL*
for
a
wounded
spirit
.
Her
mind
was
quite
determined
,
and
varied
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
such
feelings
delay
,
even
the
delay
of
much
preparation
,
would
have
*NL*
been
an
evil
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
could
hardly
be
more
impatient
for
the
*NL*
marriage
than
herself
.
In
all
the
important
preparations
of
the
mind
*NL*
she
was
complete
:
being
prepared
for
matrimony
by
an
hatred
of
home
,
*NL*
restraint
,
and
tranquillity
;
by
the
misery
of
disappointed
affection
,
*NL*
and
contempt
of
the
man
she
was
to
marry
.
The
rest
might
wait
.
The
*NL*
preparations
of
new
carriages
and
furniture
might
wait
for
London
and
*NL*
spring
,
when
her
own
taste
could
have
fairer
play
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
principals
being
all
agreed
in
this
respect
,
it
soon
appeared
that
a
*NL*
very
few
weeks
would
be
sufficient
for
such
arrangements
as
must
precede
*NL*
the
wedding
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
was
quite
ready
to
retire
,
and
make
way
for
the
fortunate
*NL*
young
woman
whom
her
dear
son
had
selected
;
and
very
early
in
November
*NL*
removed
herself
,
her
maid
,
her
footman
,
and
her
chariot
,
with
true
*NL*
dowager
propriety
,
to
Bath
,
there
to
parade
over
the
wonders
of
*NL*
Sotherton
in
her
evening
parties
;
enjoying
them
as
thoroughly
,
perhaps
,
*NL*
in
the
animation
of
a
card-table
,
as
she
had
ever
done
on
the
spot
;
and
*NL*
before
the
middle
of
the
same
month
the
ceremony
had
taken
place
which
*NL*
gave
Sotherton
another
mistress
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
very
proper
wedding
.
The
bride
was
elegantly
dressed
;
the
two
*NL*
bridesmaids
were
duly
inferior
;
her
father
gave
her
away
;
her
mother
*NL*
stood
with
salts
in
her
hand
,
expecting
to
be
agitated
;
her
aunt
tried
*NL*
to
cry
;
and
the
service
was
impressively
read
by
Dr.
Grant
.
Nothing
*NL*
could
be
objected
to
when
it
came
under
the
discussion
of
the
*NL*
neighbourhood
,
except
that
the
carriage
which
conveyed
the
bride
and
*NL*
bridegroom
and
Julia
from
the
church-door
to
Sotherton
was
the
same
*NL*
chaise
which
Mr.
Rushworth
had
used
for
a
twelvemonth
before
.
In
*NL*
everything
else
the
etiquette
of
the
day
might
stand
the
strictest
*NL*
investigation
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
done
,
and
they
were
gone
.
Sir
Thomas
felt
as
an
anxious
father
*NL*
must
feel
,
and
was
indeed
experiencing
much
of
the
agitation
which
his
*NL*
wife
had
been
apprehensive
of
for
herself
,
but
had
fortunately
escaped
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
most
happy
to
assist
in
the
duties
of
the
day
,
by
spending
*NL*
it
at
the
Park
to
support
her
sister
's
spirits
,
and
drinking
the
health
*NL*
of
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
in
a
supernumerary
glass
or
two
,
was
all
*NL*
joyous
delight
;
for
she
had
made
the
match
;
she
had
done
everything
;
*NL*
and
no
one
would
have
supposed
,
from
her
confident
triumph
,
that
she
*NL*
had
ever
heard
of
conjugal
infelicity
in
her
life
,
or
could
have
the
*NL*
smallest
insight
into
the
disposition
of
the
niece
who
had
been
brought
*NL*
up
under
her
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
plan
of
the
young
couple
was
to
proceed
,
after
a
few
days
,
to
*NL*
Brighton
,
and
take
a
house
there
for
some
weeks
.
Every
public
place
was
*NL*
new
to
Maria
,
and
Brighton
is
almost
as
gay
in
winter
as
in
summer
.
When
*NL*
the
novelty
of
amusement
there
was
over
,
it
would
be
time
for
the
wider
*NL*
range
of
London
.
*NL*
*NL*
Julia
was
to
go
with
them
to
Brighton
.
Since
rivalry
between
the
sisters
*NL*
had
ceased
,
they
had
been
gradually
recovering
much
of
their
former
good
*NL*
understanding
;
and
were
at
least
sufficiently
friends
to
make
each
of
*NL*
them
exceedingly
glad
to
be
with
the
other
at
such
a
time
.
Some
other
*NL*
companion
than
Mr.
Rushworth
was
of
the
first
consequence
to
his
lady
;
*NL*
and
Julia
was
quite
as
eager
for
novelty
and
pleasure
as
Maria
,
though
*NL*
she
might
not
have
struggled
through
so
much
to
obtain
them
,
and
could
*NL*
better
bear
a
subordinate
situation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
departure
made
another
material
change
at
Mansfield
,
a
chasm
*NL*
which
required
some
time
to
fill
up
.
The
family
circle
became
greatly
*NL*
contracted
;
and
though
the
Miss
Bertrams
had
latterly
added
little
to
*NL*
its
gaiety
,
they
could
not
but
be
missed
.
Even
their
mother
missed
them
;
*NL*
and
how
much
more
their
tenderhearted
cousin
,
who
wandered
about
*NL*
the
house
,
and
thought
of
them
,
and
felt
for
them
,
with
a
degree
of
*NL*
affectionate
regret
which
they
had
never
done
much
to
deserve
!

CHAPTER
XXII
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
consequence
increased
on
the
departure
of
her
cousins
.
Becoming
,
*NL*
as
she
then
did
,
the
only
young
woman
in
the
drawing-room
,
the
only
*NL*
occupier
of
that
interesting
division
of
a
family
in
which
she
had
*NL*
hitherto
held
so
humble
a
third
,
it
was
impossible
for
her
not
to
be
*NL*
more
looked
at
,
more
thought
of
and
attended
to
,
than
she
had
ever
been
*NL*
before
;
and
``
Where
is
Fanny
?
''
became
no
uncommon
question
,
even
without
*NL*
her
being
wanted
for
any
one
's
convenience
.
*NL*
*NL*
Not
only
at
home
did
her
value
increase
,
but
at
the
Parsonage
too
.
In
*NL*
that
house
,
which
she
had
hardly
entered
twice
a
year
since
Mr.
Norris
's
*NL*
death
,
she
became
a
welcome
,
an
invited
guest
,
and
in
the
gloom
and
dirt
*NL*
of
a
November
day
,
most
acceptable
to
Mary
Crawford
.
Her
visits
there
,
*NL*
beginning
by
chance
,
were
continued
by
solicitation
.
Mrs.
Grant
,
*NL*
really
eager
to
get
any
change
for
her
sister
,
could
,
by
the
easiest
*NL*
self-deceit
,
persuade
herself
that
she
was
doing
the
kindest
thing
by
*NL*
Fanny
,
and
giving
her
the
most
important
opportunities
of
improvement
in
*NL*
pressing
her
frequent
calls
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
having
been
sent
into
the
village
on
some
errand
by
her
aunt
*NL*
Norris
,
was
overtaken
by
a
heavy
shower
close
to
the
Parsonage
;
and
*NL*
being
descried
from
one
of
the
windows
endeavouring
to
find
shelter
*NL*
under
the
branches
and
lingering
leaves
of
an
oak
just
beyond
their
*NL*
premises
,
was
forced
,
though
not
without
some
modest
reluctance
on
her
*NL*
part
,
to
come
in
.
A
civil
servant
she
had
withstood
;
but
when
Dr.
Grant
*NL*
himself
went
out
with
an
umbrella
,
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
but
to
*NL*
be
very
much
ashamed
,
and
to
get
into
the
house
as
fast
as
possible
;
and
*NL*
to
poor
Miss
Crawford
,
who
had
just
been
contemplating
the
dismal
rain
*NL*
in
a
very
desponding
state
of
mind
,
sighing
over
the
ruin
of
all
her
*NL*
plan
of
exercise
for
that
morning
,
and
of
every
chance
of
seeing
a
*NL*
single
creature
beyond
themselves
for
the
next
twenty-four
hours
,
the
*NL*
sound
of
a
little
bustle
at
the
front
door
,
and
the
sight
of
Miss
Price
*NL*
dripping
with
wet
in
the
vestibule
,
was
delightful
.
The
value
of
an
*NL*
event
on
a
wet
day
in
the
country
was
most
forcibly
brought
before
her
.
*NL*
She
was
all
alive
again
directly
,
and
among
the
most
active
in
being
*NL*
useful
to
Fanny
,
in
detecting
her
to
be
wetter
than
she
would
at
first
*NL*
allow
,
and
providing
her
with
dry
clothes
;
and
Fanny
,
after
being
*NL*
obliged
to
submit
to
all
this
attention
,
and
to
being
assisted
and
*NL*
waited
on
by
mistresses
and
maids
,
being
also
obliged
,
on
returning
*NL*
downstairs
,
to
be
fixed
in
their
drawing-room
for
an
hour
while
the
rain
*NL*
continued
,
the
blessing
of
something
fresh
to
see
and
think
of
was
thus
*NL*
extended
to
Miss
Crawford
,
and
might
carry
on
her
spirits
to
the
period
*NL*
of
dressing
and
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
two
sisters
were
so
kind
to
her
,
and
so
pleasant
,
that
Fanny
might
*NL*
have
enjoyed
her
visit
could
she
have
believed
herself
not
in
the
way
,
*NL*
and
could
she
have
foreseen
that
the
weather
would
certainly
clear
at
*NL*
the
end
of
the
hour
,
and
save
her
from
the
shame
of
having
Dr.
Grant
's
*NL*
carriage
and
horses
out
to
take
her
home
,
with
which
she
was
threatened
.
*NL*
As
to
anxiety
for
any
alarm
that
her
absence
in
such
weather
might
*NL*
occasion
at
home
,
she
had
nothing
to
suffer
on
that
score
;
for
as
her
*NL*
being
out
was
known
only
to
her
two
aunts
,
she
was
perfectly
aware
that
*NL*
none
would
be
felt
,
and
that
in
whatever
cottage
aunt
Norris
might
chuse
*NL*
to
establish
her
during
the
rain
,
her
being
in
such
cottage
would
be
*NL*
indubitable
to
aunt
Bertram
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
beginning
to
look
brighter
,
when
Fanny
,
observing
a
harp
in
the
*NL*
room
,
asked
some
questions
about
it
,
which
soon
led
to
an
acknowledgment
*NL*
of
her
wishing
very
much
to
hear
it
,
and
a
confession
,
which
could
*NL*
hardly
be
believed
,
of
her
having
never
yet
heard
it
since
its
being
*NL*
in
Mansfield
.
To
Fanny
herself
it
appeared
a
very
simple
and
natural
*NL*
circumstance
.
She
had
scarcely
ever
been
at
the
Parsonage
since
the
*NL*
instrument
's
arrival
,
there
had
been
no
reason
that
she
should
;
but
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
,
calling
to
mind
an
early
expressed
wish
on
the
subject
,
was
*NL*
concerned
at
her
own
neglect
;
and
``
Shall
I
play
to
you
now
?
''
and
``
What
*NL*
will
you
have
?
''
were
questions
immediately
following
with
the
readiest
*NL*
good-humour
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
played
accordingly
;
happy
to
have
a
new
listener
,
and
a
listener
who
*NL*
seemed
so
much
obliged
,
so
full
of
wonder
at
the
performance
,
and
who
*NL*
shewed
herself
not
wanting
in
taste
.
She
played
till
Fanny
's
eyes
,
*NL*
straying
to
the
window
on
the
weather
's
being
evidently
fair
,
spoke
what
*NL*
she
felt
must
be
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Another
quarter
of
an
hour
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
``
and
we
shall
see
how
*NL*
it
will
be
.
Do
not
run
away
the
first
moment
of
its
holding
up
.
Those
*NL*
clouds
look
alarming
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
they
are
passed
over
,
''
said
Fanny
.
``
I
have
been
watching
them
.
This
*NL*
weather
is
all
from
the
south
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
South
or
north
,
I
know
a
black
cloud
when
I
see
it
;
and
you
must
not
*NL*
set
forward
while
it
is
so
threatening
.
And
besides
,
I
want
to
play
*NL*
something
more
to
you
--
a
very
pretty
piece
--
and
your
cousin
Edmund
's
*NL*
prime
favourite
.
You
must
stay
and
hear
your
cousin
's
favourite
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
felt
that
she
must
;
and
though
she
had
not
waited
for
that
*NL*
sentence
to
be
thinking
of
Edmund
,
such
a
memento
made
her
particularly
*NL*
awake
to
his
idea
,
and
she
fancied
him
sitting
in
that
room
again
*NL*
and
again
,
perhaps
in
the
very
spot
where
she
sat
now
,
listening
with
*NL*
constant
delight
to
the
favourite
air
,
played
,
as
it
appeared
to
her
,
*NL*
with
superior
tone
and
expression
;
and
though
pleased
with
it
herself
,
*NL*
and
glad
to
like
whatever
was
liked
by
him
,
she
was
more
sincerely
*NL*
impatient
to
go
away
at
the
conclusion
of
it
than
she
had
been
before
;
*NL*
and
on
this
being
evident
,
she
was
so
kindly
asked
to
call
again
,
to
*NL*
take
them
in
her
walk
whenever
she
could
,
to
come
and
hear
more
of
the
*NL*
harp
,
that
she
felt
it
necessary
to
be
done
,
if
no
objection
arose
at
*NL*
home
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
origin
of
the
sort
of
intimacy
which
took
place
between
*NL*
them
within
the
first
fortnight
after
the
Miss
Bertrams
'
going
away
--
an
*NL*
intimacy
resulting
principally
from
Miss
Crawford
's
desire
of
something
*NL*
new
,
and
which
had
little
reality
in
Fanny
's
feelings
.
Fanny
went
to
her
*NL*
every
two
or
three
days
:
it
seemed
a
kind
of
fascination
:
she
could
not
*NL*
be
easy
without
going
,
and
yet
it
was
without
loving
her
,
without
ever
*NL*
thinking
like
her
,
without
any
sense
of
obligation
for
being
sought
*NL*
after
now
when
nobody
else
was
to
be
had
;
and
deriving
no
higher
*NL*
pleasure
from
her
conversation
than
occasional
amusement
,
and
_
that
_
*NL*
often
at
the
expense
of
her
judgment
,
when
it
was
raised
by
pleasantry
*NL*
on
people
or
subjects
which
she
wished
to
be
respected
.
She
went
,
*NL*
however
,
and
they
sauntered
about
together
many
an
half-hour
in
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
's
shrubbery
,
the
weather
being
unusually
mild
for
the
time
of
*NL*
year
,
and
venturing
sometimes
even
to
sit
down
on
one
of
the
benches
now
*NL*
comparatively
unsheltered
,
remaining
there
perhaps
till
,
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
some
tender
ejaculation
of
Fanny
's
on
the
sweets
of
so
protracted
*NL*
an
autumn
,
they
were
forced
,
by
the
sudden
swell
of
a
cold
gust
shaking
*NL*
down
the
last
few
yellow
leaves
about
them
,
to
jump
up
and
walk
for
*NL*
warmth
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
pretty
,
very
pretty
,
''
said
Fanny
,
looking
around
her
as
*NL*
they
were
thus
sitting
together
one
day
;
``
every
time
I
come
into
this
*NL*
shrubbery
I
am
more
struck
with
its
growth
and
beauty
.
Three
years
ago
,
*NL*
this
was
nothing
but
a
rough
hedgerow
along
the
upper
side
of
the
field
,
*NL*
never
thought
of
as
anything
,
or
capable
of
becoming
anything
;
and
now
*NL*
it
is
converted
into
a
walk
,
and
it
would
be
difficult
to
say
whether
*NL*
most
valuable
as
a
convenience
or
an
ornament
;
and
perhaps
,
in
another
*NL*
three
years
,
we
may
be
forgetting
--
almost
forgetting
what
it
was
before
.
*NL*
How
wonderful
,
how
very
wonderful
the
operations
of
time
,
and
the
*NL*
changes
of
the
human
mind
!
''
And
following
the
latter
train
of
thought
,
*NL*
she
soon
afterwards
added
:
``
If
any
one
faculty
of
our
nature
may
be
*NL*
called
_
more
_
wonderful
than
the
rest
,
I
do
think
it
is
memory
.
There
*NL*
seems
something
more
speakingly
incomprehensible
in
the
powers
,
*NL*
the
failures
,
the
inequalities
of
memory
,
than
in
any
other
of
our
*NL*
intelligences
.
The
memory
is
sometimes
so
retentive
,
so
serviceable
,
so
*NL*
obedient
;
at
others
,
so
bewildered
and
so
weak
;
and
at
others
again
,
so
*NL*
tyrannic
,
so
beyond
control
!
We
are
,
to
be
sure
,
a
miracle
every
way
;
*NL*
but
our
powers
of
recollecting
and
of
forgetting
do
seem
peculiarly
past
*NL*
finding
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
,
untouched
and
inattentive
,
had
nothing
to
say
;
and
*NL*
Fanny
,
perceiving
it
,
brought
back
her
own
mind
to
what
she
thought
must
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
may
seem
impertinent
in
_
me
_
to
praise
,
but
I
must
admire
the
taste
*NL*
Mrs.
Grant
has
shewn
in
all
this
.
There
is
such
a
quiet
simplicity
in
*NL*
the
plan
of
the
walk
!
Not
too
much
attempted
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
replied
Miss
Crawford
carelessly
,
``
it
does
very
well
for
a
*NL*
place
of
this
sort
.
One
does
not
think
of
extent
_
here
_
;
and
between
*NL*
ourselves
,
till
I
came
to
Mansfield
,
I
had
not
imagined
a
country
parson
*NL*
ever
aspired
to
a
shrubbery
,
or
anything
of
the
kind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
so
glad
to
see
the
evergreens
thrive
!
''
said
Fanny
,
in
reply
.
``
My
*NL*
uncle
's
gardener
always
says
the
soil
here
is
better
than
his
own
,
and
*NL*
so
it
appears
from
the
growth
of
the
laurels
and
evergreens
in
general
.
*NL*
The
evergreen
!
How
beautiful
,
how
welcome
,
how
wonderful
the
evergreen
!
*NL*
When
one
thinks
of
it
,
how
astonishing
a
variety
of
nature
!
In
some
*NL*
countries
we
know
the
tree
that
sheds
its
leaf
is
the
variety
,
but
that
*NL*
does
not
make
it
less
amazing
that
the
same
soil
and
the
same
sun
should
*NL*
nurture
plants
differing
in
the
first
rule
and
law
of
their
existence
.
*NL*
You
will
think
me
rhapsodising
;
but
when
I
am
out
of
doors
,
especially
*NL*
when
I
am
sitting
out
of
doors
,
I
am
very
apt
to
get
into
this
sort
of
*NL*
wondering
strain
.
One
can
not
fix
one
's
eyes
on
the
commonest
natural
*NL*
production
without
finding
food
for
a
rambling
fancy
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
say
the
truth
,
''
replied
Miss
Crawford
,
``
I
am
something
like
the
*NL*
famous
Doge
at
the
court
of
Lewis
XIV.
;
and
may
declare
that
I
see
no
*NL*
wonder
in
this
shrubbery
equal
to
seeing
myself
in
it
.
If
anybody
had
*NL*
told
me
a
year
ago
that
this
place
would
be
my
home
,
that
I
should
be
*NL*
spending
month
after
month
here
,
as
I
have
done
,
I
certainly
should
*NL*
not
have
believed
them
.
I
have
now
been
here
nearly
five
months
;
and
,
*NL*
moreover
,
the
quietest
five
months
I
ever
passed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
''
_
Too
_
quiet
for
you
,
I
believe
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
have
thought
so
_
theoretically
_
myself
,
but
,
''
and
her
eyes
*NL*
brightened
as
she
spoke
,
``
take
it
all
and
all
,
I
never
spent
so
happy
a
*NL*
summer
.
But
then
,
''
with
a
more
thoughtful
air
and
lowered
voice
,
``
there
*NL*
is
no
saying
what
it
may
lead
to
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
heart
beat
quick
,
and
she
felt
quite
unequal
to
surmising
*NL*
or
soliciting
anything
more
.
Miss
Crawford
,
however
,
with
renewed
*NL*
animation
,
soon
went
on
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
conscious
of
being
far
better
reconciled
to
a
country
residence
*NL*
than
I
had
ever
expected
to
be
.
I
can
even
suppose
it
pleasant
to
*NL*
spend
_
half
_
the
year
in
the
country
,
under
certain
circumstances
,
*NL*
very
pleasant
.
An
elegant
,
moderate-sized
house
in
the
centre
of
family
*NL*
connexions
;
continual
engagements
among
them
;
commanding
the
first
*NL*
society
in
the
neighbourhood
;
looked
up
to
,
perhaps
,
as
leading
it
even
*NL*
more
than
those
of
larger
fortune
,
and
turning
from
the
cheerful
round
*NL*
of
such
amusements
to
nothing
worse
than
a
_
tete-a-tete
_
with
the
person
*NL*
one
feels
most
agreeable
in
the
world
.
There
is
nothing
frightful
in
*NL*
such
a
picture
,
is
there
,
Miss
Price
?
One
need
not
envy
the
new
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
with
such
a
home
as
_
that
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Envy
Mrs.
Rushworth
!
''
was
all
that
Fanny
attempted
to
say
.
``
Come
,
come
,
*NL*
it
would
be
very
un-handsome
in
us
to
be
severe
on
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
for
I
*NL*
look
forward
to
our
owing
her
a
great
many
gay
,
brilliant
,
happy
hours
.
*NL*
I
expect
we
shall
be
all
very
much
at
Sotherton
another
year
.
Such
*NL*
a
match
as
Miss
Bertram
has
made
is
a
public
blessing
;
for
the
first
*NL*
pleasures
of
Mr.
Rushworth
's
wife
must
be
to
fill
her
house
,
and
give
*NL*
the
best
balls
in
the
country
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
silent
,
and
Miss
Crawford
relapsed
into
thoughtfulness
,
till
*NL*
suddenly
looking
up
at
the
end
of
a
few
minutes
,
she
exclaimed
,
``
Ah
!
*NL*
here
he
is
.
''
It
was
not
Mr.
Rushworth
,
however
,
but
Edmund
,
who
then
*NL*
appeared
walking
towards
them
with
Mrs.
Grant
.
``
My
sister
and
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
.
I
am
so
glad
your
eldest
cousin
is
gone
,
that
he
may
be
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
again
.
There
is
something
in
the
sound
of
Mr.
_
Edmund
_
Bertram
*NL*
so
formal
,
so
pitiful
,
so
younger-brother-like
,
that
I
detest
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
differently
we
feel
!
''
cried
Fanny
.
``
To
me
,
the
sound
of
_
Mr.
_
*NL*
Bertram
is
so
cold
and
nothing-meaning
,
so
entirely
without
warmth
or
*NL*
character
!
It
just
stands
for
a
gentleman
,
and
that
's
all
.
But
there
is
*NL*
nobleness
in
the
name
of
Edmund
.
It
is
a
name
of
heroism
and
renown
;
of
*NL*
kings
,
princes
,
and
knights
;
and
seems
to
breathe
the
spirit
of
chivalry
*NL*
and
warm
affections
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
grant
you
the
name
is
good
in
itself
,
and
_
Lord
_
Edmund
or
_
Sir
_
*NL*
Edmund
sound
delightfully
;
but
sink
it
under
the
chill
,
the
annihilation
*NL*
of
a
Mr.
,
and
Mr.
Edmund
is
no
more
than
Mr.
John
or
Mr.
Thomas
.
Well
,
*NL*
shall
we
join
and
disappoint
them
of
half
their
lecture
upon
sitting
*NL*
down
out
of
doors
at
this
time
of
year
,
by
being
up
before
they
can
*NL*
begin
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
met
them
with
particular
pleasure
.
It
was
the
first
time
of
his
*NL*
seeing
them
together
since
the
beginning
of
that
better
acquaintance
*NL*
which
he
had
been
hearing
of
with
great
satisfaction
.
A
friendship
*NL*
between
two
so
very
dear
to
him
was
exactly
what
he
could
have
wished
:
*NL*
and
to
the
credit
of
the
lover
's
understanding
,
be
it
stated
,
that
he
*NL*
did
not
by
any
means
consider
Fanny
as
the
only
,
or
even
as
the
greater
*NL*
gainer
by
such
a
friendship
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
``
and
do
you
not
scold
us
for
our
imprudence
?
*NL*
What
do
you
think
we
have
been
sitting
down
for
but
to
be
talked
to
*NL*
about
it
,
and
entreated
and
supplicated
never
to
do
so
again
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
might
have
scolded
,
''
said
Edmund

Edmund

the

is
so
mild

your

I

``
By

is
for
a

person
at
your

,
with
such
limited

indifferent

What
can
_

You
have

not
much

you
by
the
contrast

Your

is
precisely
what

I
have
no

I
do
not

Poverty
*NL*

exactly
what

have
determined
against

Honesty

in

in

is
all

*NL*

I
do
look

anything

distinction

But
how
may
it
rise

How
may
my
honesty
at

rise
to
any
*NL*
distinction

*NL*
*NL*
This
was
not
so
very
easy
a
question
to
answer
,
and
occasioned
an
``
Oh
!
''
*NL*
of
some
length
from
the
fair
lady
before
she
could
add
,
``
You

added

in
a
more
serious
tone
,

I
thought
myself

any

absolutely
without
chance

possibility

*NL*
are
of
a

''
*NL*
*NL*
A
look
of
consciousness
as
he
spoke
,
and
what
seemed
a
consciousness
*NL*
of
manner
on
Miss
Crawford
's
side
as
she
made
some
laughing
answer
,
*NL*
was
sorrowfull
food
for
Fanny
's
observation
;
and
finding
herself
quite
*NL*
unable
to
attend
as
she
ought
to
Mrs.
Grant
,
by
whose
side
she
was
now
*NL*
following
the
others
,
she
had
nearly
resolved
on
going
home
immediately
,
*NL*
and
only
waited
for
courage
to
say
so
,
when
the
sound
of
the
great
clock
*NL*
at
Mansfield
Park
,
striking
three
,
made
her
feel
that
she
had
*NL*
really
been
much
longer
absent
than
usual
,
and
brought
the
previous
*NL*
self-inquiry
of
whether
she
should
take
leave
or
not
just
then
,
and
how
,
*NL*
to
a
very
speedy
issue
.
With
undoubting
decision
she
directly
began
her
*NL*
adieus
;
and
Edmund
began
at
the
same
time
to
recollect
that
his
mother
*NL*
had
been
inquiring
for
her
,
and
that
he
had
walked
down
to
the
Parsonage
*NL*
on
purpose
to
bring
her
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
hurry
increased
;
and
without
in
the
least
expecting
Edmund
's
*NL*
attendance
,
she
would
have
hastened
away
alone
;
but
the
general
pace
was
*NL*
quickened
,
and
they
all
accompanied
her
into
the
house
,
through
which
it
*NL*
was
necessary
to
pass
.
Dr.
Grant
was
in
the
vestibule
,
and
as
they
stopt
*NL*
to
speak
to
him
she
found
,
from
Edmund
's
manner
,
that
he
_
did
_
mean
to
*NL*
go
with
her
.
He
too
was
taking
leave
.
She
could
not
but
be
thankful
.
In
*NL*
the
moment
of
parting
,
Edmund
was
invited
by
Dr.
Grant
to
eat
his
mutton
*NL*
with
him
the
next
day
;
and
Fanny
had
barely
time
for
an
unpleasant
*NL*
feeling
on
the
occasion
,
when
Mrs.
Grant
,
with
sudden
recollection
,
*NL*
turned
to
her
and
asked
for
the
pleasure
of
her
company
too
.
This
was
*NL*
so
new
an
attention
,
so
perfectly
new
a
circumstance
in
the
events
of
*NL*
Fanny
's
life
,
that
she
was
all
surprise
and
embarrassment
;
and
while
*NL*
stammering
out
her
great
obligation
,
and
her
``
but
she
did
not
suppose
it
*NL*
would
be
in
her
power
,
''
was
looking
at
Edmund
for
his
opinion
and
help
.
*NL*
But
Edmund
,
delighted
with
her
having
such
an
happiness
offered
,
and
*NL*
ascertaining
with
half
a
look
,
and
half
a
sentence
,
that
she
had
no
*NL*
objection
but
on
her
aunt
's
account
,
could
not
imagine
that
his
mother
*NL*
would
make
any
difficulty
of
sparing
her
,
and
therefore
gave
his
decided
*NL*
open
advice
that
the
invitation
should
be
accepted
;
and
though
Fanny
*NL*
would
not
venture
,
even
on
his
encouragement
,
to
such
a
flight
of
*NL*
audacious
independence
,
it
was
soon
settled
,
that
if
nothing
were
heard
*NL*
to
the
contrary
,
Mrs.
Grant
might
expect
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
you
know
what
your
dinner
will
be
,
''
said
Mrs.
Grant
,
smiling
--
``
the
*NL*
turkey
,
and
I
assure
you
a
very
fine
one
;
for

turning
to
her
*NL*
husband
,
``

insists
upon

turkey

being
dressed

*NL*
*NL*
``
Very

well

Dr.

,
``

Price

I
dare
say

would
take
their
chance

none

hear
the
bill
of
fare

friendly
meeting
,

not
a
fine
dinner

is
all
we
have
in
view

turkey

a
goose
,
or

of
mutton

whatever
you
and
your
cook
chuse

The
two
cousins
walked
home
together
;
and
,
except
in
the
immediate
*NL*
discussion
of
this
engagement
,
which
Edmund
spoke
of
with
the
warmest
*NL*
satisfaction
,
as
so
particularly
desirable
for
her
in
the
intimacy
which
*NL*
he
saw
with
so
much
pleasure
established
,
it
was
a
silent
walk
;
for
*NL*
having
finished
that
subject
,
he
grew
thoughtful
and
indisposed
for
any
*NL*
other

``

preventing
his

speaking

``
Fanny
will
immediately
say
No

I
am
sure

would

and
I
can
see
no
reason

she
*NL*
should
not

``
I
can
not
imagine
why
Mrs.

never

used
to
ask
your
sisters
now

then

never

*NL*
*NL*
``
If

Fanny

in

comfort

on

looking
in

minute
in

way
from
his
plantation
to
his
dressing-room

she
called

him
back
again
,
when
he
had
almost
closed
the
door

with

Thomas

a
moment

something

Her
tone

calm
languor

she
never
took
the
trouble

raising
her

voice

was
always
heard

attended
to

and
Sir
Thomas
came
back
.
Her
*NL*
story
began
;
and
Fanny
immediately
slipped
out
of
the
room
;
for
to
hear
*NL*
herself
the
subject
of
any
discussion
with
her
uncle
was
more
than
her
*NL*
nerves
could
bear
.
She
was
anxious
,
she
knew
--
more
anxious
perhaps
than
*NL*
she
ought
to
be
--
for
what
was
it
after
all
whether
she
went
or
staid
?
*NL*
but
if
her
uncle
were
to
be
a
great
while
considering
and
deciding
,
and
*NL*
with
very
grave
looks
,
and
those
grave
looks
directed
to
her
,
and
*NL*
at
last
decide
against
her
,
she
might
not
be
able
to
appear
properly
*NL*
submissive
and
indifferent
.
Her
cause
,
meanwhile
,
went
on
well
.
It
*NL*
began
,
on
Lady
Bertram
's
part
,
with
--
``
I
have
something
to
tell
you
that
*NL*
will
surprise
you
.
Mrs.
Grant
has
asked
Fanny
to
dinner
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
as
if
waiting
more
to
accomplish
the
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Edmund
wants
her
to
go
.
But
how
can
I
spare
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
will
be
late
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
taking
out
his
watch
;
``
but
what
is
*NL*
your
difficulty
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
found
himself
obliged
to
speak
and
fill
up
the
blanks
in
his
*NL*
mother
's
story
.
He
told
the
whole
;
and
she
had
only
to
add
,
``
So
strange
!
*NL*
for
Mrs.
Grant
never
used
to
ask
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
is
it
not
very
natural
,
''
observed
Edmund
,
``
that
Mrs.
Grant
should
*NL*
wish
to
procure
so
agreeable
a
visitor
for
her
sister
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
can
be
more
natural
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
short
*NL*
deliberation
;
``
nor
,
were
there
no
sister
in
the
case
,
could
anything
,
*NL*
in
my
opinion
,
be
more
natural
.
Mrs.
Grant
's
shewing
civility
to
Miss
*NL*
Price
,
to
Lady
Bertram
's
niece
,
could
never
want
explanation
.
The
only
*NL*
surprise
I
can
feel
is
,
that
this
should
be
the
_
first
_
time
of
its
*NL*
being
paid
.
Fanny
was
perfectly
right
in
giving
only
a
conditional
*NL*
answer
.
She
appears
to
feel
as
she
ought
.
But
as
I
conclude
that
she
*NL*
must
wish
to
go
,
since
all
young
people
like
to
be
together
,
I
can
see
*NL*
no
reason
why
she
should
be
denied
the
indulgence
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
can
I
do
without
her
,
Sir
Thomas
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
I
think
you
may
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
always
makes
tea
,
you
know
,
when
my
sister
is
not
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Your
sister
,
perhaps
,
may
be
prevailed
on
to
spend
the
day
with
us
,
and
*NL*
I
shall
certainly
be
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
then
,
Fanny
may
go
,
Edmund
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
good
news
soon
followed
her
.
Edmund
knocked
at
her
door
in
his
way
*NL*
to
his
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Fanny
,
it
is
all
happily
settled
,
and
without
the
smallest
*NL*
hesitation
on
your
uncle
's
side
.
He
had
but
one
opinion
.
You
are
to
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
you
,
I
am
_
so
_
glad
,
''
was
Fanny
's
instinctive
reply
;
though
when
*NL*
she
had
turned
from
him
and
shut
the
door
,
she
could
not
help
feeling
,
*NL*
``
And
yet
why
should
I
be
glad
?
for
am
I
not
certain
of
seeing
or
hearing
*NL*
something
there
to
pain
me
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
this
conviction
,
however
,
she
was
glad
.
Simple
as
such
an
*NL*
engagement
might
appear
in
other
eyes
,
it
had
novelty
and
importance
in
*NL*
hers
,
for
excepting
the
day
at
Sotherton
,
she
had
scarcely
ever
dined
*NL*
out
before
;
and
though
now
going
only
half
a
mile
,
and
only
to
three
*NL*
people
,
still
it
was
dining
out
,
and
all
the
little
interests
of
*NL*
preparation
were
enjoyments
in
themselves
.
She
had
neither
sympathy
nor
*NL*
assistance
from
those
who
ought
to
have
entered
into
her
feelings
and
*NL*
directed
her
taste
;
for
Lady
Bertram
never
thought
of
being
useful
to
*NL*
anybody
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
,
when
she
came
on
the
morrow
,
in
consequence
of
*NL*
an
early
call
and
invitation
from
Sir
Thomas
,
was
in
a
very
ill
humour
,
*NL*
and
seemed
intent
only
on
lessening
her
niece
's
pleasure
,
both
present
*NL*
and
future
,
as
much
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Upon
my
word
,
Fanny
,
you
are
in
high
luck
to
meet
with
such
attention
*NL*
and
indulgence
!
You
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
Mrs.
Grant
for
*NL*
thinking
of
you
,
and
to
your
aunt
for
letting
you
go
,
and
you
ought
to
*NL*
look
upon
it
as
something
extraordinary
;
for
I
hope
you
are
aware
that
*NL*
there
is
no
real
occasion
for
your
going
into
company
in
this
sort
of
*NL*
way
,
or
ever
dining
out
at
all
;
and
it
is
what
you
must
not
depend
upon
*NL*
ever
being
repeated
.
Nor
must
you
be
fancying
that
the
invitation
is
*NL*
meant
as
any
particular
compliment
to
_
you
_
;
the
compliment
is
intended
*NL*
to
your
uncle
and
aunt
and
me
.
Mrs.
Grant
thinks
it
a
civility
due
to
*NL*
_
us
_
to
take
a
little
notice
of
you
,
or
else
it
would
never
have
come
*NL*
into
her
head
,
and
you
may
be
very
certain
that
,
if
your
cousin
Julia
*NL*
had
been
at
home
,
you
would
not
have
been
asked
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
had
now
so
ingeniously
done
away
all
Mrs.
Grant
's
part
of
*NL*
the
favour
,
that
Fanny
,
who
found
herself
expected
to
speak
,
could
only
*NL*
say
that
she
was
very
much
obliged
to
her
aunt
Bertram
for
sparing
her
,
*NL*
and
that
she
was
endeavouring
to
put
her
aunt
's
evening
work
in
such
a
*NL*
state
as
to
prevent
her
being
missed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
depend
upon
it
,
your
aunt
can
do
very
well
without
you
,
or
you
*NL*
would
not
be
allowed
to
go
.
_
I
_
shall
be
here
,
so
you
may
be
quite
easy
*NL*
about
your
aunt
.
And
I
hope
you
will
have
a
very
_
agreeable
_
day
,
and
*NL*
find
it
all
mighty
_
delightful
_
.
But
I
must
observe
that
five
is
the
*NL*
very
awkwardest
of
all
possible
numbers
to
sit
down
to
table
;
and
I
*NL*
can
not
but
be
surprised
that
such
an
_
elegant
_
lady
as
Mrs.
Grant
should
*NL*
not
contrive
better
!
And
round
their
enormous
great
wide
table
,
too
,
*NL*
which
fills
up
the
room
so
dreadfully
!
Had
the
doctor
been
contented
to
*NL*
take
my
dining-table
when
I
came
away
,
as
anybody
in
their
senses
would
*NL*
have
done
,
instead
of
having
that
absurd
new
one
of
his
own
,
which
is
*NL*
wider
,
literally
wider
than
the
dinner-table
here
,
how
infinitely
better
*NL*
it
would
have
been
!
and
how
much
more
he
would
have
been
respected
!
for
*NL*
people
are
never
respected
when
they
step
out
of
their
proper
sphere
.
*NL*
Remember
that
,
Fanny
.
Five
--
only
five
to
be
sitting
round
that
table
.
*NL*
However
,
you
will
have
dinner
enough
on
it
for
ten
,
I
dare
say
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
fetched
breath
,
and
went
on
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
nonsense
and
folly
of
people
's
stepping
out
of
their
rank
and
*NL*
trying
to
appear
above
themselves
,
makes
me
think
it
right
to
give
_
you
_
*NL*
a
hint
,
Fanny
,
now
that
you
are
going
into
company
without
any
of
us
;
*NL*
and
I
do
beseech
and
entreat
you
not
to
be
putting
yourself
forward
,
and
*NL*
talking
and
giving
your
opinion
as
if
you
were
one
of
your
cousins
--
as
*NL*
if
you
were
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
or
Julia
.
_
That
_
will
never
do
,
believe
*NL*
me
.
Remember
,
wherever
you
are
,
you
must
be
the
lowest
and
last
;
and
*NL*
though
Miss
Crawford
is
in
a
manner
at
home
at
the
Parsonage
,
you
are
*NL*
not
to
be
taking
place
of
her
.
And
as
to
coming
away
at
night
,
you
are
*NL*
to
stay
just
as
long
as
Edmund
chuses
.
Leave
him
to
settle
_
that
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
ma'am
,
I
should
not
think
of
anything
else
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
if
it
should
rain
,
which
I
think
exceedingly
likely
,
for
I
never
*NL*
saw
it
more
threatening
for
a
wet
evening
in
my
life
,
you
must
manage
as
*NL*
well
as
you
can
,
and
not
be
expecting
the
carriage
to
be
sent
for
you
.
I
*NL*
certainly
do
not
go
home
to-night
,
and
,
therefore
,
the
carriage
will
not
*NL*
be
out
on
my
account
;
so
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
what
may
happen
,
*NL*
and
take
your
things
accordingly

*NL*
*NL*
Her
niece
thought
it
perfectly
reasonable
.
She
rated
her
own
claims
*NL*
to
comfort
as
low
even
as
Mrs.
Norris
could
;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
soon
*NL*
afterwards
,
just
opening
the
door
,
said
,
``
Fanny
,
at
what
time
would
you
*NL*
have
the
carriage
come
round
?
''
she
felt
a
degree
of
astonishment
which
*NL*
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
speak
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Sir
Thomas
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
red
with
anger
,
``
Fanny
can
*NL*
walk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Walk
!
''
repeated
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
tone
of
most
unanswerable
dignity
,
and
*NL*
coming
farther
into
the
room
.
``
My
niece
walk
to
a
dinner
engagement
at
*NL*
this
time
of
the
year
!
Will
twenty
minutes
after
four
suit
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
,
''
was
Fanny
's
humble
answer
,
given
with
the
feelings
almost
*NL*
of
a
criminal
towards
Mrs.
Norris
;
and
not
bearing
to
remain
with
her
*NL*
in
what
might
seem
a
state
of
triumph
,
she
followed
her
uncle
out
of
*NL*
the
room
,
having
staid
behind
him
only
long
enough
to
hear
these
words
*NL*
spoken
in
angry
agitation
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Quite
unnecessary
!
a
great
deal
too
kind
!
But
Edmund
goes
;
true
,
it
is
*NL*
upon
Edmund
's
account
.
I
observed
he
was
hoarse
on
Thursday
night
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
could
not
impose
on
Fanny
.
She
felt
that
the
carriage
was
for
*NL*
herself
,
and
herself
alone
:
and
her
uncle
's
consideration
of
her
,
coming
*NL*
immediately
after
such
representations
from
her
aunt
,
cost
her
some
*NL*
tears
of
gratitude
when
she
was
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
coachman
drove
round
to
a
minute
;
another
minute
brought
down
the
*NL*
gentleman
;
and
as
the
lady
had
,
with
a
most
scrupulous
fear
of
being
*NL*
late
,
been
many
minutes
seated
in
the
drawing-room
,
Sir
Thomas
saw
them
*NL*
off
in
as
good
time
as
his
own
correctly
punctual
habits
required
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
I
must
look
at
you
,
Fanny
,
''
said
Edmund
,
with
the
kind
smile
of
an
*NL*
affectionate
brother
,
``
and
tell
you
how
I
like
you
;
and
as
well
as
I
can
*NL*
judge
by
this
light
,
you
look
very
nicely
indeed
.
What
have
you
got
on
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
new
dress
that
my
uncle
was
so
good
as
to
give
me
on
my
cousin
's
*NL*
marriage
.
I
hope
it
is
not
too
fine
;
but
I
thought
I
ought
to
wear
it
as
*NL*
soon
as
I
could
,
and
that
I
might
not
have
such
another
opportunity
all
*NL*
the
winter
.
I
hope
you
do
not
think
me
too
fine

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
woman
can
never
be
too
fine
while
she
is
all
in
white

No

I
see
no
*NL*
finery
about
you
;
nothing
but
what
is
perfectly
proper
.
Your
gown
seems
*NL*
very
pretty
.
I
like
these
glossy
spots

Has
not
Miss
Crawford
a
gown
*NL*
something
the
same
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
approaching
the
Parsonage
they
passed
close
by
the
stable-yard
and
*NL*
coach-house
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Heyday
!
''
said
Edmund
,
``
here
's
company
,
here
's
a
carriage
!
who
have
they
*NL*
got
to
meet
us
?
''
And
letting
down
the
side-glass
to
distinguish
,
''
'T
is
*NL*
Crawford
's
,
Crawford
's
barouche
,
I
protest
!
There
are
his
own
two
men
*NL*
pushing
it
back
into
its
old
quarters
.
He
is
here
,
of
course
.
This
is
*NL*
quite
a
surprise
,
Fanny
.
I
shall
be
very
glad
to
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
no
occasion
,
there
was
no
time
for
Fanny
to
say
how
very
*NL*
differently
she
felt
;
but
the
idea
of
having
such
another
to
observe
*NL*
her
was
a
great
increase
of
the
trepidation
with
which
she
performed
the
*NL*
very
awful
ceremony
of
walking
into
the
drawing-room
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
drawing-room
Mr.
Crawford
certainly
was
,
having
been
just
long
*NL*
enough
arrived
to
be
ready
for
dinner
;
and
the
smiles
and
pleased
looks
*NL*
of
the
three
others
standing
round
him
,
shewed
how
welcome
was
his
*NL*
sudden
resolution
of
coming
to
them
for
a
few
days
on
leaving
Bath
.
*NL*
A
very
cordial
meeting
passed
between
him
and
Edmund
;
and
with
the
*NL*
exception
of
Fanny
,
the
pleasure
was
general
;
and
even
to
_
her
_
there
*NL*
might
be
some
advantage
in
his
presence
,
since
every
addition
to
the
*NL*
party
must
rather
forward
her
favourite
indulgence
of
being
suffered
to
*NL*
sit
silent
and
unattended
to
.
She
was
soon
aware
of
this
herself
;
for
*NL*
though
she
must
submit
,
as
her
own
propriety
of
mind
directed
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
her
aunt
Norris
's
opinion
,
to
being
the
principal
lady
in
company
,
*NL*
and
to
all
the
little
distinctions
consequent
thereon
,
she
found
,
while
*NL*
they
were
at
table
,
such
a
happy
flow
of
conversation
prevailing
,
in
*NL*
which
she
was
not
required
to
take
any
part
--
there
was
so
much
to
be
*NL*
said
between
the
brother
and
sister
about
Bath
,
so
much
between
the
two
*NL*
young
men
about
hunting
,
so
much
of
politics
between
Mr.
Crawford
and
*NL*
Dr.
Grant
,
and
of
everything
and
all
together
between
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
as
to
leave
her
the
fairest
prospect
of
having
only
*NL*
to
listen
in
quiet
,
and
of
passing
a
very
agreeable
day
.
She
could
not
*NL*
compliment
the
newly
arrived
gentleman
,
however
,
with
any
appearance
of
*NL*
interest
,
in
a
scheme
for
extending
his
stay
at
Mansfield
,
and
sending
*NL*
for
his
hunters
from
Norfolk
,
which
,
suggested
by
Dr.
Grant
,
advised
by
*NL*
Edmund
,
and
warmly
urged
by
the
two
sisters
,
was
soon
in
possession
of
*NL*
his
mind
,
and
which
he
seemed
to
want
to
be
encouraged
even
by
her
to
*NL*
resolve
on
.
Her
opinion
was
sought
as
to
the
probable
continuance
of
the
*NL*
open
weather
,
but
her
answers
were
as
short
and
indifferent
as
civility
*NL*
allowed
.
She
could
not
wish
him
to
stay
,
and
would
much
rather
not
have
*NL*
him
speak
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
two
absent
cousins
,
especially
Maria
,
were
much
in
her
thoughts
on
*NL*
seeing
him
;
but
no
embarrassing
remembrance
affected
_
his
_
spirits
.
*NL*
Here
he
was
again
on
the
same
ground
where
all
had
passed
before
,
and
*NL*
apparently
as
willing
to
stay
and
be
happy
without
the
Miss
Bertrams
,
*NL*
as
if
he
had
never
known
Mansfield
in
any
other
state
.
She
heard
them
*NL*
spoken
of
by
him
only
in
a
general
way
,
till
they
were
all
re-assembled
*NL*
in
the
drawing-room
,
when
Edmund
,
being
engaged
apart
in
some
matter
of
*NL*
business
with
Dr.
Grant
,
which
seemed
entirely
to
engross
them
,
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Grant
occupied
at
the
tea-table
,
he
began
talking
of
them
with
more
*NL*
particularity
to
his
other
sister
.
With
a
significant
smile
,
which
made
*NL*
Fanny
quite
hate
him
,
he
said
,
``
So
!
Rushworth
and
his
fair
bride
are
at
*NL*
Brighton
,
I
understand
;
happy
man
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
they
have
been
there
about
a
fortnight
,
Miss
Price
,
have
they
not
?
*NL*
And
Julia
is
with
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mr.
Yates
,
I
presume
,
is
not
far
off
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mr.
Yates
!
Oh
!
we
hear
nothing
of
Mr.
Yates
.
I
do
not
imagine
he
*NL*
figures
much
in
the
letters
to
Mansfield
Park
;
do
you
,
Miss
Price
?
I
*NL*
think
my
friend
Julia
knows
better
than
to
entertain
her
father
with
Mr.
*NL*
Yates
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Rushworth
and
his
two-and-forty
speeches
!
''
continued
Crawford
.
*NL*
``
Nobody
can
ever
forget
them
.
Poor
fellow
!
I
see
him
now
--
his
toil
and
*NL*
his
despair
.
Well
,
I
am
much
mistaken
if
his
lovely
Maria
will
ever
want
*NL*
him
to
make
two-and-forty
speeches
to
her
''
;
adding
,
with
a
momentary
*NL*
seriousness
,
``
She
is
too
good
for
him
--
much
too
good
.
''
And
then
changing
*NL*
his
tone
again
to
one
of
gentle
gallantry
,
and
addressing
Fanny
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
You
were
Mr.
Rushworth
's
best
friend
.
Your
kindness
and
patience
*NL*
can
never
be
forgotten
,
your
indefatigable
patience
in
trying
to
make
it
*NL*
possible
for
him
to
learn
his
part
--
in
trying
to
give
him
a
brain
*NL*
which
nature
had
denied
--
to
mix
up
an
understanding
for
him
out
of
the
*NL*
superfluity
of
your
own
!
_
He
_
might
not
have
sense
enough
himself
to
*NL*
estimate
your
kindness
,
but
I
may
venture
to
say
that
it
had
honour
from
*NL*
all
the
rest
of
the
party
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
coloured
,
and
said
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
as
a
dream
,
a
pleasant
dream
!
''
he
exclaimed
,
breaking
forth
*NL*
again
,
after
a
few
minutes
'
musing
.
``
I
shall
always
look
back
on
our
*NL*
theatricals
with
exquisite
pleasure
.
There
was
such
an
interest
,
such
an
*NL*
animation
,
such
a
spirit
diffused
.
Everybody
felt
it
.
We
were
all
alive
.
*NL*
There
was
employment
,
hope
,
solicitude
,
bustle
,
for
every
hour
of
*NL*
the
day
.
Always
some
little
objection
,
some
little
doubt
,
some
little
*NL*
anxiety
to
be
got
over
.
I
never
was
happier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
silent
indignation
Fanny
repeated
to
herself
,
``
Never
*NL*
happier
!
--
never
happier
than
when
doing
what
you
must
know
was
not
*NL*
justifiable
!
--
never
happier
than
when
behaving
so
dishonourably
and
*NL*
unfeelingly
!
Oh
!
what
a
corrupted
mind
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
were
unlucky
,
Miss
Price
,
''
he
continued
,
in
a
lower
tone
,
to
avoid
*NL*
the
possibility
of
being
heard
by
Edmund
,
and
not
at
all
aware
of
her
*NL*
feelings
,
``
we
certainly
were
very
unlucky
.
Another
week
,
only
one
other
*NL*
week
,
would
have
been
enough
for
us
.
I
think
if
we
had
had
the
disposal
*NL*
of
events
--
if
Mansfield
Park
had
had
the
government
of
the
winds
*NL*
just
for
a
week
or
two
,
about
the
equinox
,
there
would
have
been
*NL*
a
difference
.
Not
that
we
would
have
endangered
his
safety
by
any
*NL*
tremendous
weather
--
but
only
by
a
steady
contrary
wind
,
or
a
calm
.
I
*NL*
think
,
Miss
Price
,
we
would
have
indulged
ourselves
with
a
week
's
calm
*NL*
in
the
Atlantic
at
that
season
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
seemed
determined
to
be
answered
;
and
Fanny
,
averting
her
face
,
said
,
*NL*
with
a
firmer
tone
than
usual
,
``
As
far
as
_
I
_
am
concerned
,
sir
,
I
would
*NL*
not
have
delayed
his
return
for
a
day
.
My
uncle
disapproved
it
all
so
*NL*
entirely
when
he
did
arrive
,
that
in
my
opinion
everything
had
gone
*NL*
quite
far
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
never
spoken
so
much
at
once
to
him
in
her
life
before
,
and
*NL*
never
so
angrily
to
any
one
;
and
when
her
speech
was
over
,
she
trembled
*NL*
and
blushed
at
her
own
daring
.
He
was
surprised
;
but
after
a
few
*NL*
moments
'
silent
consideration
of
her
,
replied
in
a
calmer
,
graver
tone
,
*NL*
and
as
if
the
candid
result
of
conviction
,
``
I
believe
you
are
right
.
*NL*
It
was
more
pleasant
than
prudent
.
We
were
getting
too
noisy
.
''
And
*NL*
then
turning
the
conversation
,
he
would
have
engaged
her
on
some
other
*NL*
subject
,
but
her
answers
were
so
shy
and
reluctant
that
he
could
not
*NL*
advance
in
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
,
who
had
been
repeatedly
eyeing
Dr.
Grant
and
Edmund
,
*NL*
now
observed
,
``
Those
gentlemen
must
have
some
very
interesting
point
to
*NL*
discuss
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
most
interesting
in
the
world
,
''
replied
her
brother
--
``
how
to
make
*NL*
money
;
how
to
turn
a
good
income
into
a
better
.
Dr.
Grant
is
giving
*NL*
Bertram
instructions
about
the
living
he
is
to
step
into
so
soon
.
I
find
*NL*
he
takes
orders
in
a
few
weeks
.
They
were
at
it
in
the
dining-parlour
.
I
*NL*
am
glad
to
hear
Bertram
will
be
so
well
off
.
He
will
have
a
very
pretty
*NL*
income
to
make
ducks
and
drakes
with
,
and
earned
without
much
trouble
.
I
*NL*
apprehend
he
will
not
have
less
than
seven
hundred
a
year
.
Seven
hundred
*NL*
a
year
is
a
fine
thing
for
a
younger
brother
;
and
as
of
course
he
will
*NL*
still
live
at
home
,
it
will
be
all
for
his
_
menus
_
_
plaisirs
_
;
and
a
*NL*
sermon
at
Christmas
and
Easter
,
I
suppose
,
will
be
the
sum
total
of
*NL*
sacrifice
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
His
sister
tried
to
laugh
off
her
feelings
by
saying
,
``
Nothing
amuses
me
*NL*
more
than
the
easy
manner
with
which
everybody
settles
the
abundance
of
*NL*
those
who
have
a
great
deal
less
than
themselves

You
would
look
rather
*NL*
blank
,
Henry
,
if
your
_
menus
_
_
plaisirs
_
were
to
be
limited
to
seven
*NL*
hundred
a
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
I
might
;
but
all
_
that
_
you
know
is
entirely
comparative
.
*NL*
Birthright
and
habit
must
settle
the
business
.
Bertram
is
certainly
well
*NL*
off
for
a
cadet
of
even
a
baronet
's
family
.
By
the
time
he
is
four
or
*NL*
five
and
twenty
he
will
have
seven
hundred
a
year
,
and
nothing
to
do
for
*NL*
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
_
could
_
have
said
that
there
would
be
a
something
to
do
*NL*
and
to
suffer
for
it
,
which
she
could
not
think
lightly
of
;
but
she
*NL*
checked
herself
and
let
it
pass
;
and
tried
to
look
calm
and
unconcerned
*NL*
when
the
two
gentlemen
shortly
afterwards
joined
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bertram
,
''
said
Henry
Crawford
,
``
I
shall
make
a
point
of
coming
to
*NL*
Mansfield
to
hear
you
preach
your
first
sermon

I
shall
come
on
purpose
*NL*
to
encourage
a
young
beginner

When
is
it
to
be
?
Miss
Price
,
will
not
*NL*
you
join
me
in
encouraging
your
cousin

Will
not
you
engage
to

with
your
eyes
steadily
fixed
on
him
the
whole
time

I
shall
do

not
*NL*
to
lose
a
word
;

only
looking
off
just
to
note
down
any
sentence
*NL*
preeminently
beautiful
?
We
will
provide
ourselves
with
tablets
and
a
*NL*
pencil
.
When
will
it
be
?
You
must
preach
at
Mansfield
,
you
know
,
that
*NL*
Sir
Thomas

Lady
Bertram
may
hear
you

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
keep
clear
of
you

as
long
as
I
can

said
Edmund
;
*NL*
``
for
you
would
be
more
likely
to
disconcert
me

I
should
be
more
*NL*
sorry
to
see
you
trying
at
it
than
almost
any
other
man

*NL*
*NL*
``
Will
he
not
feel
this
?
''
thought
Fanny
.
``
No

he
can
feel
nothing
as
he
*NL*
ought

*NL*
*NL*
The
party
being
now
all
united
,
and
the
chief
talkers
attracting
each
*NL*
other
,
she
remained
in
tranquillity
;
and
as
a
whist-table
was
formed
*NL*
after
tea
--
formed
really
for
the
amusement
of
Dr.
Grant
,
by
his
*NL*
attentive
wife
,
though
it
was
not
to
be
supposed
so
--
and
Miss
Crawford
*NL*
took
her
harp
,
she
had
nothing
to
do
but
to
listen
;
and
her
tranquillity
*NL*
remained
undisturbed
the
rest
of
the
evening
,
except
when
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
now
and
then
addressed
to
her
a
question
or
observation
,
which
she
could
*NL*
not
avoid
answering
.
Miss
Crawford
was
too
much
vexed
by
what
had
passed
*NL*
to
be
in
a
humour
for
anything
but
music
.
With
that
she
soothed
herself
*NL*
and
amused
her
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
assurance
of
Edmund
's
being
so
soon
to
take
orders
,
coming
upon
her
*NL*
like
a
blow
that
had
been
suspended
,
and
still
hoped
uncertain
and
at
a
*NL*
distance
,
was
felt
with
resentment
and
mortification
.
She
was
very
angry
*NL*
with
him
.
She
had
thought
her
influence
more
.
She
_
had
_
begun
to
think
*NL*
of
him
;
she
felt
that
she
had
,
with
great
regard
,
with
almost
decided
*NL*
intentions
;
but
she
would
now
meet
him
with
his
own
cool
feelings
.
It
*NL*
was
plain
that
he
could
have
no
serious
views
,
no
true
attachment
,
by
*NL*
fixing
himself
in
a
situation
which
he
must
know
she
would
never
*NL*
stoop
to
.
She
would
learn
to
match
him
in
his
indifference
.
She
would
*NL*
henceforth
admit
his
attentions
without
any
idea
beyond
immediate
*NL*
amusement
.
If
_
he
_
could
so
command
his
affections
,
_
hers
_
should
do
her
*NL*
no
harm

CHAPTER
XXIV
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Crawford
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
by
the
next
morning
to
give
*NL*
another
fortnight
to
Mansfield
,
and
having
sent
for
his
hunters
,
and
*NL*
written
a
few
lines
of
explanation
to
the
Admiral
,
he
looked
round
at
*NL*
his
sister
as
he
sealed
and
threw
the
letter
from
him
,
and
seeing
the
*NL*
coast
clear
of
the
rest
of
the
family
,
said
,
with
a
smile
,
``
And
how
do
*NL*
you
think
I
mean
to
amuse
myself
,
Mary
,
on
the
days
that
I
do
not
hunt
?
*NL*
I
am
grown
too
old
to
go
out
more
than
three
times
a
week
;
but
I
have
a
*NL*
plan
for
the
intermediate
days
,
and
what
do
you
think
it
is
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
walk
and
ride
with
me
,
to
be
sure
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
exactly
,
though
I
shall
be
happy
to
do
both
,
but
_
that
_
would
be
*NL*
exercise
only
to
my
body
,
and
I
must
take
care
of
my
mind
.
Besides
,
*NL*
_
that
_
would
be
all
recreation
and
indulgence
,
without
the
wholesome
*NL*
alloy
of
labour
,
and
I
do
not
like
to
eat
the
bread
of
idleness
.
No
,
my
*NL*
plan
is
to
make
Fanny
Price
in
love
with
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
Price
!
Nonsense
!
No
,
no
.
You
ought
to
be
satisfied
with
her
two
*NL*
cousins
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
I
can
not
be
satisfied
without
Fanny
Price
,
without
making
a
small
*NL*
hole
in
Fanny
Price
's
heart
.
You
do
not
seem
properly
aware
of
her
*NL*
claims
to
notice
.
When
we
talked
of
her
last
night
,
you
none
of
you
*NL*
seemed
sensible
of
the
wonderful
improvement
that
has
taken
place
in
her
*NL*
looks
within
the
last
six
weeks
.
You
see
her
every
day
,
and
therefore
do
*NL*
not
notice
it
;
but
I
assure
you
she
is
quite
a
different
creature
from
*NL*
what
she
was
in
the
autumn
.
She
was
then
merely
a
quiet
,
modest
,
not
*NL*
plain-looking
girl
,
but
she
is
now
absolutely
pretty
.
I
used
to
think
*NL*
she
had
neither
complexion
nor
countenance
;
but
in
that
soft
skin
of
*NL*
hers
,
so
frequently
tinged
with
a
blush
as
it
was
yesterday
,
there
is
*NL*
decided
beauty
;
and
from
what
I
observed
of
her
eyes
and
mouth
,
I
do
*NL*
not
despair
of
their
being
capable
of
expression
enough
when
she
*NL*
has
anything
to
express
.
And
then
,
her
air
,
her
manner
,
her
_
tout
_
*NL*
_
ensemble
_
,
is
so
indescribably
improved
!
She
must
be
grown
two
inches
,
*NL*
at
least
,
since
October
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Phoo
!
phoo
!
This
is
only
because
there
were
no
tall
women
to
compare
*NL*
her
with
,
and
because
she
has
got
a
new
gown
,
and
you
never
saw
her
so
*NL*
well
dressed
before
.
She
is
just
what
she
was
in
October
,
believe
me
.
*NL*
The
truth
is
,
that
she
was
the
only
girl
in
company
for
you
to
notice
,
*NL*
and
you
must
have
a
somebody
.
I
have
always
thought
her
pretty
--
not
*NL*
strikingly
pretty
--
but
`
pretty
enough
,
'
as
people
say
;
a
sort
of
beauty
*NL*
that
grows
on
one
.
Her
eyes
should
be
darker
,
but
she
has
a
sweet
smile
;
*NL*
but
as
for
this
wonderful
degree
of
improvement
,
I
am
sure
it
may
all
*NL*
be
resolved
into
a
better
style
of
dress
,
and
your
having
nobody
else
to
*NL*
look
at
;
and
therefore
,
if
you
do
set
about
a
flirtation
with
her
,
you
*NL*
never
will
persuade
me
that
it
is
in
compliment
to
her
beauty
,
or
that
*NL*
it
proceeds
from
anything
but
your
own
idleness
and
folly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
brother
gave
only
a
smile
to
this
accusation
,
and
soon
afterwards
*NL*
said
,
``
I
do
not
quite
know
what
to
make
of
Miss
Fanny
.
I
do
not
*NL*
understand
her
.
I
could
not
tell
what
she
would
be
at
yesterday
.
What
is
*NL*
her
character
?
Is
she
solemn
?
Is
she
queer
?
Is
she
prudish
?
Why
did
she
*NL*
draw
back
and
look
so
grave
at
me
?
I
could
hardly
get
her
to
speak
.
I
*NL*
never
was
so
long
in
company
with
a
girl
in
my
life
,
trying
to
entertain
*NL*
her
,
and
succeed
so
ill
!
Never
met
with
a
girl
who
looked
so
grave
on
*NL*
me
!
I
must
try
to
get
the
better
of
this
.
Her
looks
say
,
'
I
will
not
*NL*
like
you
,
I
am
determined
not
to
like
you
'
;
and
I
say
she
shall
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Foolish
fellow
!
And
so
this
is
her
attraction
after
all
!
This
it
is
,
*NL*
her
not
caring
about
you
,
which
gives
her
such
a
soft
skin
,
and
makes
*NL*
her
so
much
taller
,
and
produces
all
these
charms
and
graces
!
I
do
*NL*
desire
that
you
will
not
be
making
her
really
unhappy
;
a
_
little
_
love
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
may
animate
and
do
her
good
,
but
I
will
not
have
you
plunge
*NL*
her
deep
,
for
she
is
as
good
a
little
creature
as
ever
lived
,
and
has
a
*NL*
great
deal
of
feeling
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
can
be
but
for
a
fortnight
,
''
said
Henry
;
``
and
if
a
fortnight
can
*NL*
kill
her
,
she
must
have
a
constitution
which
nothing
could
save
.
No
,
I
*NL*
will
not
do
her
any
harm
,
dear
little
soul
!
only
want
her
to
look
kindly
*NL*
on
me
,
to
give
me
smiles
as
well
as
blushes
,
to
keep
a
chair
for
me
by
*NL*
herself
wherever
we
are
,
and
be
all
animation
when
I
take
it
and
talk
*NL*
to
her
;
to
think
as
I
think
,
be
interested
in
all
my
possessions
and
*NL*
pleasures
,
try
to
keep
me
longer
at
Mansfield
,
and
feel
when
I
go
away
*NL*
that
she
shall
be
never
happy
again
.
I
want
nothing
more
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Moderation
itself
!
''
said
Mary
.
``
I
can
have
no
scruples
now
.
Well
,
you
*NL*
will
have
opportunities
enough
of
endeavouring
to
recommend
yourself
,
*NL*
for
we
are
a
great
deal
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
without
attempting
any
farther
remonstrance
,
she
left
Fanny
to
*NL*
her
fate
,
a
fate
which
,
had
not
Fanny
's
heart
been
guarded
in
a
way
*NL*
unsuspected
by
Miss
Crawford
,
might
have
been
a
little
harder
than
she
*NL*
deserved
;
for
although
there
doubtless
are
such
unconquerable
young
*NL*
ladies
of
eighteen
-LRB-
or
one
should
not
read
about
them
-RRB-
as
are
never
*NL*
to
be
persuaded
into
love
against
their
judgment
by
all
that
talent
,
*NL*
manner
,
attention
,
and
flattery
can
do
,
I
have
no
inclination
to
*NL*
believe
Fanny
one
of
them
,
or
to
think
that
with
so
much
tenderness
*NL*
of
disposition
,
and
so
much
taste
as
belonged
to
her
,
she
could
have
*NL*
escaped
heart-whole
from
the
courtship
-LRB-
though
the
courtship
only
of
*NL*
a
fortnight
-RRB-
of
such
a
man
as
Crawford
,
in
spite
of
there
being
some
*NL*
previous
ill
opinion
of
him
to
be
overcome
,
had
not
her
affection
been
*NL*
engaged
elsewhere
.
With
all
the
security
which
love
of
another
and
*NL*
disesteem
of
him
could
give
to
the
peace
of
mind
he
was
attacking
,
*NL*
his
continued
attentions
--
continued
,
but
not
obtrusive
,
and
adapting
*NL*
themselves
more
and
more
to
the
gentleness
and
delicacy
of
her
*NL*
character
--
obliged
her
very
soon
to
dislike
him
less
than
formerly
.
She
*NL*
had
by
no
means
forgotten
the
past
,
and
she
thought
as
ill
of
him
as
*NL*
ever
;
but
she
felt
his
powers
:
he
was
entertaining
;
and
his
manners
were
*NL*
so
improved
,
so
polite
,
so
seriously
and
blamelessly
polite
,
that
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
be
civil
to
him
in
return
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
few
days
were
enough
to
effect
this
;
and
at
the
end
of
those
few
*NL*
days
,
circumstances
arose
which
had
a
tendency
rather
to
forward
his
*NL*
views
of
pleasing
her
,
inasmuch
as
they
gave
her
a
degree
of
happiness
*NL*
which
must
dispose
her
to
be
pleased
with
everybody
.
William
,
her
*NL*
brother
,
the
so
long
absent
and
dearly
loved
brother
,
was
in
England
*NL*
again
.
She
had
a
letter
from
him
herself
,
a
few
hurried
happy
lines
,
*NL*
written
as
the
ship
came
up
Channel
,
and
sent
into
Portsmouth
with
*NL*
the
first
boat
that
left
the
Antwerp
at
anchor
in
Spithead
;
and
when
*NL*
Crawford
walked
up
with
the
newspaper
in
his
hand
,
which
he
had
hoped
*NL*
would
bring
the
first
tidings
,
he
found
her
trembling
with
joy
over
this
*NL*
letter
,
and
listening
with
a
glowing
,
grateful
countenance
to
the
kind
*NL*
invitation
which
her
uncle
was
most
collectedly
dictating
in
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
but
the
day
before
that
Crawford
had
made
himself
thoroughly
*NL*
master
of
the
subject
,
or
had
in
fact
become
at
all
aware
of
her
having
*NL*
such
a
brother
,
or
his
being
in
such
a
ship
,
but
the
interest
then
*NL*
excited
had
been
very
properly
lively
,
determining
him
on
his
return
to
*NL*
town
to
apply
for
information
as
to
the
probable
period
of
the
Antwerp
's
*NL*
return
from
the
Mediterranean
,
etc.
;
and
the
good
luck
which
attended
*NL*
his
early
examination
of
ship
news
the
next
morning
seemed
the
reward
of
*NL*
his
ingenuity
in
finding
out
such
a
method
of
pleasing
her
,
as
well
as
*NL*
of
his
dutiful
attention
to
the
Admiral
,
in
having
for
many
years
*NL*
taken
in
the
paper
esteemed
to
have
the
earliest
naval
intelligence
.
He
*NL*
proved
,
however
,
to
be
too
late
.
All
those
fine
first
feelings
,
of
which
*NL*
he
had
hoped
to
be
the
exciter
,
were
already
given
.
But
his
intention
,
*NL*
the
kindness
of
his
intention
,
was
thankfully
acknowledged
:
quite
*NL*
thankfully
and
warmly
,
for
she
was
elevated
beyond
the
common
timidity
*NL*
of
her
mind
by
the
flow
of
her
love
for
William
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dear
William
would
soon
be
amongst
them
.
There
could
be
no
doubt
*NL*
of
his
obtaining
leave
of
absence
immediately
,
for
he
was
still
only
a
*NL*
midshipman
;
and
as
his
parents
,
from
living
on
the
spot
,
must
already
*NL*
have
seen
him
,
and
be
seeing
him
perhaps
daily
,
his
direct
holidays
*NL*
might
with
justice
be
instantly
given
to
the
sister
,
who
had
been
his
*NL*
best
correspondent
through
a
period
of
seven
years
,
and
the
uncle
who
*NL*
had
done
most
for
his
support
and
advancement
;
and
accordingly
the
reply
*NL*
to
her
reply
,
fixing
a
very
early
day
for
his
arrival
,
came
as
soon
as
*NL*
possible
;
and
scarcely
ten
days
had
passed
since
Fanny
had
been
in
*NL*
the
agitation
of
her
first
dinner-visit
,
when
she
found
herself
in
an
*NL*
agitation
of
a
higher
nature
,
watching
in
the
hall
,
in
the
lobby
,
on
*NL*
the
stairs
,
for
the
first
sound
of
the
carriage
which
was
to
bring
her
a
*NL*
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
came
happily
while
she
was
thus
waiting
;
and
there
being
neither
*NL*
ceremony
nor
fearfulness
to
delay
the
moment
of
meeting
,
she
was
with
*NL*
him
as
he
entered
the
house
,
and
the
first
minutes
of
exquisite
feeling
*NL*
had
no
interruption
and
no
witnesses
,
unless
the
servants
chiefly
intent
*NL*
upon
opening
the
proper
doors
could
be
called
such
.
This
was
exactly
*NL*
what
Sir
Thomas
and
Edmund
had
been
separately
conniving
at
,
as
each
*NL*
proved
to
the
other
by
the
sympathetic
alacrity
with
which
they
both
*NL*
advised
Mrs.
Norris
's
continuing
where
she
was
,
instead
of
rushing
out
*NL*
into
the
hall
as
soon
as
the
noises
of
the
arrival
reached
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
and
Fanny
soon
shewed
themselves
;
and
Sir
Thomas
had
the
*NL*
pleasure
of
receiving
,
in
his
protege
,
certainly
a
very
different
person
*NL*
from
the
one
he
had
equipped
seven
years
ago
,
but
a
young
man
of
an
*NL*
open
,
pleasant
countenance
,
and
frank
,
unstudied
,
but
feeling
and
*NL*
respectful
manners
,
and
such
as
confirmed
him
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
long
before
Fanny
could
recover
from
the
agitating
happiness
of
*NL*
such
an
hour
as
was
formed
by
the
last
thirty
minutes
of
expectation
,
*NL*
and
the
first
of
fruition
;
it
was
some
time
even
before
her
happiness
*NL*
could
be
said
to
make
her
happy
,
before
the
disappointment
inseparable
*NL*
from
the
alteration
of
person
had
vanished
,
and
she
could
see
in
him
the
*NL*
same
William
as
before
,
and
talk
to
him
,
as
her
heart
had
been
yearning
*NL*
to
do
through
many
a
past
year
.
That
time
,
however
,
did
gradually
come
,
*NL*
forwarded
by
an
affection
on
his
side
as
warm
as
her
own
,
and
much
less
*NL*
encumbered
by
refinement
or
self-distrust
.
She
was
the
first
object
*NL*
of
his
love
,
but
it
was
a
love
which
his
stronger
spirits
,
and
bolder
*NL*
temper
,
made
it
as
natural
for
him
to
express
as
to
feel
.
On
the
*NL*
morrow
they
were
walking
about
together
with
true
enjoyment
,
and
every
*NL*
succeeding
morrow
renewed
a
_
tete-a-tete
_
which
Sir
Thomas
could
not
but
*NL*
observe
with
complacency
,
even
before
Edmund
had
pointed
it
out
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Excepting
the
moments
of
peculiar
delight
,
which
any
marked
or
*NL*
unlooked-for
instance
of
Edmund
's
consideration
of
her
in
the
last
few
*NL*
months
had
excited
,
Fanny
had
never
known
so
much
felicity
in
her
life
,
*NL*
as
in
this
unchecked
,
equal
,
fearless
intercourse
with
the
brother
and
*NL*
friend
who
was
opening
all
his
heart
to
her
,
telling
her
all
his
hopes
*NL*
and
fears
,
plans
,
and
solicitudes
respecting
that
long
thought
of
,
*NL*
dearly
earned
,
and
justly
valued
blessing
of
promotion
;
who
could
give
*NL*
her
direct
and
minute
information
of
the
father
and
mother
,
brothers
and
*NL*
sisters
,
of
whom
she
very
seldom
heard
;
who
was
interested
in
all
the
*NL*
comforts
and
all
the
little
hardships
of
her
home
at
Mansfield
;
ready
to
*NL*
think
of
every
member
of
that
home
as
she
directed
,
or
differing
only
*NL*
by
a
less
scrupulous
opinion
,
and
more
noisy
abuse
of
their
aunt
Norris
,
*NL*
and
with
whom
-LRB-
perhaps
the
dearest
indulgence
of
the
whole
-RRB-
all
the
evil
*NL*
and
good
of
their
earliest
years
could
be
gone
over
again
,
and
every
*NL*
former
united
pain
and
pleasure
retraced
with
the
fondest
recollection
.
*NL*
An
advantage
this
,
a
strengthener
of
love
,
in
which
even
the
conjugal
*NL*
tie
is
beneath
the
fraternal
.
Children
of
the
same
family
,
the
same
*NL*
blood
,
with
the
same
first
associations
and
habits
,
have
some
means
of
*NL*
enjoyment
in
their
power
,
which
no
subsequent
connexions
can
supply
;
and
*NL*
it
must
be
by
a
long
and
unnatural
estrangement
,
by
a
divorce
which
*NL*
no
subsequent
connexion
can
justify
,
if
such
precious
remains
of
the
*NL*
earliest
attachments
are
ever
entirely
outlived
.
Too
often
,
alas
!
it
is
*NL*
so
.
Fraternal
love
,
sometimes
almost
everything
,
is
at
others
worse
than
*NL*
nothing
.
But
with
William
and
Fanny
Price
it
was
still
a
sentiment
*NL*
in
all
its
prime
and
freshness
,
wounded
by
no
opposition
of
interest
,
*NL*
cooled
by
no
separate
attachment
,
and
feeling
the
influence
of
time
and
*NL*
absence
only
in
its
increase
.
*NL*
*NL*
An
affection
so
amiable
was
advancing
each
in
the
opinion
of
all
who
had
*NL*
hearts
to
value
anything
good
.
Henry
Crawford
was
as
much
struck
with
*NL*
it
as
any
.
He
honoured
the
warm-hearted
,
blunt
fondness
of
the
young
*NL*
sailor
,
which
led
him
to
say
,
with
his
hands
stretched
towards
Fanny
's
*NL*
head
,
``
Do
you
know
,
I
begin
to
like
that
queer
fashion
already
,
though
*NL*
when
I
first
heard
of
such
things
being
done
in
England
,
I
could
*NL*
not
believe
it
;
and
when
Mrs.
Brown
,
and
the
other
women
at
the
*NL*
Commissioner
's
at
Gibraltar
,
appeared
in
the
same
trim
,
I
thought
they
*NL*
were
mad
;
but
Fanny
can
reconcile
me
to
anything
''
;
and
saw
,
with
lively
*NL*
admiration
,
the
glow
of
Fanny
's
cheek
,
the
brightness
of
her
eye
,
the
*NL*
deep
interest
,
the
absorbed
attention
,
while
her
brother
was
describing
*NL*
any
of
the
imminent
hazards
,
or
terrific
scenes
,
which
such
a
period
at
*NL*
sea
must
supply
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
picture
which
Henry
Crawford
had
moral
taste
enough
to
value
.
*NL*
Fanny
's
attractions
increased
--
increased
twofold
;
for
the
sensibility
*NL*
which
beautified
her
complexion
and
illumined
her
countenance
was
an
*NL*
attraction
in
itself
.
He
was
no
longer
in
doubt
of
the
capabilities
of
*NL*
her
heart
.
She
had
feeling
,
genuine
feeling
.
It
would
be
something
to
*NL*
be
loved
by
such
a
girl
,
to
excite
the
first
ardours
of
her
young
*NL*
unsophisticated
mind
!
She
interested
him
more
than
he
had
foreseen
.
A
*NL*
fortnight
was
not
enough
.
His
stay
became
indefinite
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
often
called
on
by
his
uncle
to
be
the
talker
.
His
recitals
*NL*
were
amusing
in
themselves
to
Sir
Thomas
,
but
the
chief
object
in
*NL*
seeking
them
was
to
understand
the
reciter
,
to
know
the
young
man
by
his
*NL*
histories
;
and
he
listened
to
his
clear
,
simple
,
spirited
details
*NL*
with
full
satisfaction
,
seeing
in
them
the
proof
of
good
principles
,
*NL*
professional
knowledge
,
energy
,
courage
,
and
cheerfulness
,
everything
*NL*
that
could
deserve
or
promise
well
.
Young
as
he
was
,
William
had
already
*NL*
seen
a
great
deal
.
He
had
been
in
the
Mediterranean
;
in
the
West
Indies
;
*NL*
in
the
Mediterranean
again
;
had
been
often
taken
on
shore
by
the
favour
*NL*
of
his
captain
,
and
in
the
course
of
seven
years
had
known
every
variety
*NL*
of
danger
which
sea
and
war
together
could
offer
.
With
such
means
in
*NL*
his
power
he
had
a
right
to
be
listened
to
;
and
though
Mrs.
Norris
could
*NL*
fidget
about
the
room
,
and
disturb
everybody
in
quest
of
two
needlefuls
*NL*
of
thread
or
a
second-hand
shirt
button
,
in
the
midst
of
her
nephew
's
*NL*
account
of
a
shipwreck
or
an
engagement
,
everybody
else
was
attentive
;
*NL*
and
even
Lady
Bertram
could
not
hear
of
such
horrors
unmoved
,
or
*NL*
without
sometimes
lifting
her
eyes
from
her
work
to
say
,
``
Dear
me
!
how
*NL*
disagreeable
!
I
wonder
anybody
can
ever
go
to
sea
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
To
Henry
Crawford
they
gave
a
different
feeling
.
He
longed
to
have
been
*NL*
at
sea
,
and
seen
and
done
and
suffered
as
much
.
His
heart
was
warmed
,
*NL*
his
fancy
fired
,
and
he
felt
the
highest
respect
for
a
lad
who
,
before
*NL*
he
was
twenty
,
had
gone
through
such
bodily
hardships
and
given
such
*NL*
proofs
of
mind
.
The
glory
of
heroism
,
of
usefulness
,
of
exertion
,
of
*NL*
endurance
,
made
his
own
habits
of
selfish
indulgence
appear
in
shameful
*NL*
contrast
;
and
he
wished
he
had
been
a
William
Price
,
distinguishing
*NL*
himself
and
working
his
way
to
fortune
and
consequence
with
so
much
*NL*
self-respect
and
happy
ardour
,
instead
of
what
he
was
!
*NL*
*NL*
The
wish
was
rather
eager
than
lasting
.
He
was
roused
from
the
reverie
*NL*
of
retrospection
and
regret
produced
by
it
,
by
some
inquiry
from
Edmund
*NL*
as
to
his
plans
for
the
next
day
's
hunting
;
and
he
found
it
was
as
well
*NL*
to
be
a
man
of
fortune
at
once
with
horses
and
grooms
at
his
command
.
*NL*
In
one
respect
it
was
better
,
as
it
gave
him
the
means
of
conferring
a
*NL*
kindness
where
he
wished
to
oblige
.
With
spirits
,
courage
,
and
curiosity
*NL*
up
to
anything
,
William
expressed
an
inclination
to
hunt
;
and
Crawford
*NL*
could
mount
him
without
the
slightest
inconvenience
to
himself
,
and
with
*NL*
only
some
scruples
to
obviate
in
Sir
Thomas
,
who
knew
better
than
his
*NL*
nephew
the
value
of
such
a
loan
,
and
some
alarms
to
reason
away
in
*NL*
Fanny
.
She
feared
for
William
;
by
no
means
convinced
by
all
that
he
*NL*
could
relate
of
his
own
horsemanship
in
various
countries
,
of
the
*NL*
scrambling
parties
in
which
he
had
been
engaged
,
the
rough
horses
and
*NL*
mules
he
had
ridden
,
or
his
many
narrow
escapes
from
dreadful
falls
,
*NL*
that
he
was
at
all
equal
to
the
management
of
a
high-fed
hunter
in
an
*NL*
English
fox-chase
;
nor
till
he
returned
safe
and
well
,
without
accident
*NL*
or
discredit
,
could
she
be
reconciled
to
the
risk
,
or
feel
any
of
that
*NL*
obligation
to
Mr.
Crawford
for
lending
the
horse
which
he
had
fully
*NL*
intended
it
should
produce
.
When
it
was
proved
,
however
,
to
have
done
*NL*
William
no
harm
,
she
could
allow
it
to
be
a
kindness
,
and
even
reward
*NL*
the
owner
with
a
smile
when
the
animal
was
one
minute
tendered
to
his
*NL*
use
again
;
and
the
next
,
with
the
greatest
cordiality
,
and
in
a
manner
*NL*
not
to
be
resisted
,
made
over
to
his
use
entirely
so
long
as
he
remained
*NL*
in
Northamptonshire
.

CHAPTER
XXV
*NL*
*NL*
The
intercourse
of
the
two
families
was
at
this
period
more
nearly
*NL*
restored
to
what
it
had
been
in
the
autumn
,
than
any
member
of
the
*NL*
old
intimacy
had
thought
ever
likely
to
be
again
.
The
return
of
Henry
*NL*
Crawford
,
and
the
arrival
of
William
Price
,
had
much
to
do
with
it
,
*NL*
but
much
was
still
owing
to
Sir
Thomas
's
more
than
toleration
of
the
*NL*
neighbourly
attempts
at
the
Parsonage
.
His
mind
,
now
disengaged
from
*NL*
the
cares
which
had
pressed
on
him
at
first
,
was
at
leisure
to
find
*NL*
the
Grants
and
their
young
inmates
really
worth
visiting
;
and
though
*NL*
infinitely
above
scheming
or
contriving
for
any
the
most
advantageous
*NL*
matrimonial
establishment
that
could
be
among
the
apparent
possibilities
*NL*
of
any
one
most
dear
to
him
,
and
disdaining
even
as
a
littleness
the
*NL*
being
quick-sighted
on
such
points
,
he
could
not
avoid
perceiving
,
in
*NL*
a
grand
and
careless
way
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
was
somewhat
distinguishing
*NL*
his
niece
--
nor
perhaps
refrain
-LRB-
though
unconsciously
-RRB-
from
giving
a
more
*NL*
willing
assent
to
invitations
on
that
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
His
readiness
,
however
,
in
agreeing
to
dine
at
the
Parsonage
,
when
the
*NL*
general
invitation
was
at
last
hazarded
,
after
many
debates
and
many
*NL*
doubts
as
to
whether
it
were
worth
while
,
``
because
Sir
Thomas
seemed
*NL*
so
ill
inclined
,
and
Lady
Bertram
was
so
indolent
!
''
proceeded
from
*NL*
good-breeding
and
goodwill
alone
,
and
had
nothing
to
do
with
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
,
but
as
being
one
in
an
agreeable
group
:
for
it
was
in
the
*NL*
course
of
that
very
visit
that
he
first
began
to
think
that
any
one
in
*NL*
the
habit
of
such
idle
observations
_
would
_
_
have
_
_
thought
_
that
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
was
the
admirer
of
Fanny
Price
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
meeting
was
generally
felt
to
be
a
pleasant
one
,
being
composed
in
a
*NL*
good
proportion
of
those
who
would
talk
and
those
who
would
listen
;
*NL*
and
the
dinner
itself
was
elegant
and
plentiful
,
according
to
the
usual
*NL*
style
of
the
Grants
,
and
too
much
according
to
the
usual
habits
of
*NL*
all
to
raise
any
emotion
except
in
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
could
never
behold
*NL*
either
the
wide
table
or
the
number
of
dishes
on
it
with
patience
,
and
*NL*
who
did
always
contrive
to
experience
some
evil
from
the
passing
of
the
*NL*
servants
behind
her
chair
,
and
to
bring
away
some
fresh
conviction
of
*NL*
its
being
impossible
among
so
many
dishes
but
that
some
must
be
cold
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
it
was
found
,
according
to
the
predetermination
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
and
her
sister
,
that
after
making
up
the
whist-table
there
would
*NL*
remain
sufficient
for
a
round
game
,
and
everybody
being
as
perfectly
*NL*
complying
and
without
a
choice
as
on
such
occasions
they
always
are
,
*NL*
speculation
was
decided
on
almost
as
soon
as
whist
;
and
Lady
Bertram
*NL*
soon
found
herself
in
the
critical
situation
of
being
applied
to
for
her
*NL*
own
choice
between
the
games
,
and
being
required
either
to
draw
a
card
*NL*
for
whist
or
not
.
She
hesitated
.
Luckily
Sir
Thomas
was
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
shall
I
do
,
Sir
Thomas
?
Whist
and
speculation
;
which
will
amuse
me
*NL*
most
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
recommended
speculation
.
He
was
*NL*
a
whist
player
himself
,
and
perhaps
might
feel
that
it
would
not
much
*NL*
amuse
him
to
have
her
for
a
partner
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
well
,
''
was
her
ladyship
's
contented
answer
;
``
then
speculation
,
if
*NL*
you
please
,
Mrs.
Grant
.
I
know
nothing
about
it
,
but
Fanny
must
teach
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Fanny
interposed
,
however
,
with
anxious
protestations
of
her
own
*NL*
equal
ignorance
;
she
had
never
played
the
game
nor
seen
it
played
in
*NL*
her
life
;
and
Lady
Bertram
felt
a
moment
's
indecision
again
;
but
upon
*NL*
everybody
's
assuring
her
that
nothing
could
be
so
easy
,
that
it
was
the
*NL*
easiest
game
on
the
cards
,
and
Henry
Crawford
's
stepping
forward
with
a
*NL*
most
earnest
request
to
be
allowed
to
sit
between
her
ladyship
and
Miss
*NL*
Price
,
and
teach
them
both
,
it
was
so
settled
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
,
and
Dr.
and
Mrs.
Grant
being
seated
at
the
table
of
prime
*NL*
intellectual
state
and
dignity
,
the
remaining
six
,
under
Miss
Crawford
's
*NL*
direction
,
were
arranged
round
the
other
.
It
was
a
fine
arrangement
*NL*
for
Henry
Crawford
,
who
was
close
to
Fanny
,
and
with
his
hands
full
of
*NL*
business
,
having
two
persons
'
cards
to
manage
as
well
as
his
own
;
for
*NL*
though
it
was
impossible
for
Fanny
not
to
feel
herself
mistress
of
the
*NL*
rules
of
the
game
in
three
minutes
,
he
had
yet
to
inspirit
her
play
,
*NL*
sharpen
her
avarice
,
and
harden
her
heart
,
which
,
especially
in
any
*NL*
competition
with
William
,
was
a
work
of
some
difficulty
;
and
as
for
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
,
he
must
continue
in
charge
of
all
her
fame
and
fortune
through
*NL*
the
whole
evening
;
and
if
quick
enough
to
keep
her
from
looking
at
her
*NL*
cards
when
the
deal
began
,
must
direct
her
in
whatever
was
to
be
done
*NL*
with
them
to
the
end
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
high
spirits
,
doing
everything
with
happy
ease
,
and
preeminent
*NL*
in
all
the
lively
turns
,
quick
resources
,
and
playful
impudence
that
*NL*
could
do
honour
to
the
game
;
and
the
round
table
was
altogether
a
very
*NL*
comfortable
contrast
to
the
steady
sobriety
and
orderly
silence
of
the
*NL*
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
Twice
had
Sir
Thomas
inquired
into
the
enjoyment
and
success
of
his
*NL*
lady
,
but
in
vain
;
no
pause
was
long
enough
for
the
time
his
measured
*NL*
manner
needed
;
and
very
little
of
her
state
could
be
known
till
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
was
able
,
at
the
end
of
the
first
rubber
,
to
go
to
her
and
pay
her
*NL*
compliments
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
hope
your
ladyship
is
pleased
with
the
game
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
dear
,
yes
!
very
entertaining
indeed
.
A
very
odd
game
.
I
do
not
know
*NL*
what
it
is
all
about
.
I
am
never
to
see
my
cards
;
and
Mr.
Crawford
does
*NL*
all
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Bertram
,
''
said
Crawford
,
some
time
afterwards
,
taking
the
opportunity
*NL*
of
a
little
languor
in
the
game
,
``
I
have
never
told
you
what
happened
to
*NL*
me
yesterday
in
my
ride
home
.
''
They
had
been
hunting
together
,
and
were
*NL*
in
the
midst
of
a
good
run
,
and
at
some
distance
from
Mansfield
,
when
*NL*
his
horse
being
found
to
have
flung
a
shoe
,
Henry
Crawford
had
been
*NL*
obliged
to
give
up
,
and
make
the
best
of
his
way
back
.
``
I
told
you
I
*NL*
lost
my
way
after
passing
that
old
farmhouse
with
the
yew-trees
,
because
*NL*
I
can
never
bear
to
ask
;
but
I
have
not
told
you
that
,
with
my
usual
*NL*
luck
--
for
I
never
do
wrong
without
gaining
by
it
--
I
found
myself
in
due
*NL*
time
in
the
very
place
which
I
had
a
curiosity
to
see
.
I
was
suddenly
,
*NL*
upon
turning
the
corner
of
a
steepish
downy
field
,
in
the
midst
of
*NL*
a
retired
little
village
between
gently
rising
hills
;
a
small
stream
*NL*
before
me
to
be
forded
,
a
church
standing
on
a
sort
of
knoll
to
my
*NL*
right
--
which
church
was
strikingly
large
and
handsome
for
the
place
,

*NL*
not
a
gentleman
or
half
a
gentleman
's
house
to
be
seen
excepting
one

to
*NL*
be
presumed
the
Parsonage

within
a
stone
's
throw
of
the
said
knoll

*NL*
church

I
found
myself
,
in
short
,
in
Thornton
Lacey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
sounds
like
it

said
Edmund
;
``
but
which
way
did
you
turn
after
*NL*
passing
Sewell
's
farm
?

*NL*
*NL*
``
I

an
hour

You

*NL*
*NL*
``
No

I
never

But
I
_
told

a
man
mending
a
hedge
that
it
was
*NL*
Thornton
Lacey
,
and
he
agreed
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
good
memory
.
I
had
forgotten
having
ever
told
you
half
so
*NL*
much
of
the
place
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Thornton
Lacey
was
the
name
of
his
impending
living
,
as
Miss
Crawford
*NL*
well
knew
;
and
her
interest
in
a
negotiation
for
William
Price
's
knave
*NL*
increased
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
continued
Edmund
,
``
and
how
did
you
like
what
you
saw
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
much
indeed
.
You
are
a
lucky
fellow
.
There
will
be
work
for
five
*NL*
summers
at
least
before
the
place
is
liveable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
not
so
bad
as
that
.
The
farmyard
must
be
moved
,
I
grant
you
;
*NL*
but
I
am
not
aware
of
anything
else
.
The
house
is
by
no
means
bad
,
and
*NL*
when
the
yard
is
removed
,
there
may
be
a
very
tolerable
approach
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
farmyard
must
be
cleared
away
entirely
,
and
planted
up
to
shut
*NL*
out
the
blacksmith
's
shop
.
The
house
must
be
turned
to
front
the
east
*NL*
instead
of
the
north
--
the
entrance
and
principal
rooms
,
I
mean
,
must
be
*NL*
on
that
side
,
where
the
view
is
really
very
pretty
;
I
am
sure
it
may
be
*NL*
done
.
And
_
there
_
must
be
your
approach
,
through
what
is
at
present
the
*NL*
garden
.
You
must
make
a
new
garden
at
what
is
now
the
back
of
the
house
;
*NL*
which
will
be
giving
it
the
best
aspect
in
the
world
,
sloping
to
the
*NL*
south-east
.
The
ground
seems
precisely
formed
for
it
.
I
rode
fifty
yards
*NL*
up
the
lane
,
between
the
church
and
the
house
,
in
order
to
look
about
*NL*
me
;
and
saw
how
it
might
all
be
.
Nothing
can
be
easier
.
The
meadows
*NL*
beyond
what
_
will
_
_
be
_
the
garden
,
as
well
as
what
now
_
is
_
,
sweeping
*NL*
round
from
the
lane
I
stood
in
to
the
north-east
,
that
is
,
to
the
*NL*
principal
road
through
the
village
,
must
be
all
laid
together
,
of
*NL*
course
;
very
pretty
meadows
they
are
,
finely
sprinkled
with
timber
.
They
*NL*
belong
to
the
living
,
I
suppose
;
if
not
,
you
must
purchase
them
.
Then
*NL*
the
stream
--
something
must
be
done
with
the
stream
;
but
I
could
not
*NL*
quite
determine
what
.
I
had
two
or
three
ideas
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
I
have
two
or
three
ideas
also
,
''
said
Edmund
,
``
and
one
of
them
is
,
*NL*
that
very
little
of
your
plan
for
Thornton
Lacey
will
ever
be
put
in
*NL*
practice
.
I
must
be
satisfied
with
rather
less
ornament
and
beauty
.
I
*NL*
think
the
house
and
premises
may
be
made
comfortable
,
and
given
the
air
*NL*
of
a
gentleman
's
residence
,
without
any
very
heavy
expense
,
and
that
*NL*
must
suffice
me
;
and
,
I
hope
,
may
suffice
all
who
care
about
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
,
a
little
suspicious
and
resentful
of
a
certain
tone
of
*NL*
voice
,
and
a
certain
half-look
attending
the
last
expression
of
his
*NL*
hope
,
made
a
hasty
finish
of
her
dealings
with
William
Price
;
and
*NL*
securing
his
knave
at
an
exorbitant
rate
,
exclaimed
,
``
There
,
I
will
*NL*
stake
my
last
like
a
woman
of
spirit

No
cold
prudence
for
me

I
am
not
*NL*
born
to
sit
still
and
do
nothing

If
I
lose
the
game

it
shall
not
be

from
not
striving
for
it

*NL*
*NL*
The
game
was
hers
,
and
only
did
not
pay
her
for
what
she
had
given
*NL*
to
secure
it
.
Another
deal
proceeded
,
and
Crawford
began
again
about
*NL*
Thornton
Lacey
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
plan
may
not
be
the
best
possible
:
I
had
not
many
minutes
to
form
*NL*
it
in
;
but
you
must
do
a
good
deal
.
The
place
deserves
it
,
and
you
*NL*
will
find
yourself
not
satisfied
with
much
less
than
it
is
capable
of
.
*NL*
-LRB-
Excuse
me
,
your

must
not
see
your
cards

There
,
let
them
lie
*NL*
just
before
you
.
-RRB-
The
place
deserves
it
,
Bertram
.
You
talk
of
giving
it
*NL*
the
air
of
a
gentleman
's
residence
.
_
That
_
will
be
done
by
the
removal
*NL*
of
the
farmyard
;
for
,
independent
of
that
terrible
nuisance
,
I
never
saw
*NL*
a
house
of
the
kind
which
had
in
itself
so
much
the
air
of
a
*NL*
gentleman

residence
,
so
much
the
look
of
a
something
above
a
mere
*NL*
parsonage-house
--
above
the
expenditure
of
a
few
hundreds
a
year
.
It
is
*NL*
not
a
scrambling
collection
of
low
single
rooms
,
with
as
many
roofs
*NL*
as
windows
;
it
is
not
cramped
into
the
vulgar
compactness
of
a
square
*NL*
farmhouse
:
it
is
a
solid
,
roomy
,
mansion-like
looking
house
,
such
as
*NL*
one
might
suppose
a
respectable
old
country
family
had
lived
in
from
*NL*
generation
to
generation
,
through
two
centuries
at
least
,
and
were
now
*NL*
spending
from
two
to
three
thousand
a
year
in
.
''
Miss
Crawford
listened
,
*NL*
and
Edmund
agreed
to
this
.
``
The
air
of
a

therefore
,
you
can
not

give
it
,

do
anything

But
it
is
capable
*NL*
of
much
more
.
-LRB-
Let
me
see
,
Mary
;
Lady
Bertram
bids
a
dozen
for
that
*NL*
queen
;
no

no

a
dozen
is
more
than
it
is
worth

Lady
Bertram
does
not

bid

She

Go

-RRB-
By

such
improvements

I

suggested

I
do
not
really

you
to
*NL*
proceed
upon

by

I
doubt
anybody

striking
out

raise
it

it

judicious
improvement

the
residence
of
a
man
of
education

taste
,
*NL*
modern
manners

good
connexions

All
this
may
be
stamped
on
it
;
and
that

house
receive
such
an
air
as
to
make
its
owner
be
set
down
as
the
*NL*
great
landholder
of
the
parish
by
every
creature
travelling
the
road

as
there
is
no

dispute
the

circumstance

with
a
softened
voice
to
Fanny

*NL*
``
Have
you
ever

*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
gave
a
quick
negative

tried
to
hide
her
interest
in
the

subject
by
an
eager
attention
to
her

who
was
driving
as
hard

bargain

imposing
on

as

Crawford
pursued

with

again

going

hot
day
in

to
drive

about

grounds

and
see
his
genius
take
fire

There
we
went
,

*NL*
there

what
was

there

*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
eyes
were
turned
on
Crawford
for
a
moment
with
an
expression
*NL*
more
than
grave
--
even
reproachful

on
catching
his
,
were
instantly
*NL*
withdrawn

With
something
of
consciousness
he
shook
his
head
at
his

sister

laughingly
replied
,
``
I
can
not

there
was
much
done

it

we
were
all
walking
after
each

bewildered

As
soon
as
a
general
buzz
gave
him
shelter
,
he
*NL*
added
,
in
a
low
voice
,
directed
solely
at
Fanny
,
``

Sotherton

a

just
then
in
the

happy

securing
the

capital

her

against

called
out

high
good-humour

Your

not

Mrs.

was
beginning
an
eager

affability

depend
on

when

was
stopped
by
Sir

my

be
happy

you
will
find

most
sincerely
disposed
to
regard
all

*NL*
``
I
would
rather
find
him
private
secretary

First

anything
else

was
William
's
only
answer
,
in
an
undervoice
,
not
meant
*NL*
to
reach
far
,
and
the
subject
dropped
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
yet
Sir
Thomas
had
seen
nothing
to
remark
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
*NL*
behaviour
;
but
when
the
whist-table
broke
up
at
the
end
of
the
second
*NL*
rubber
,
and
leaving
Dr.
Grant
and
Mrs.
Norris
to
dispute
over
their
last
*NL*
play
,
he
became
a
looker-on
at
the
other
,
he
found
his
niece
the
*NL*
object
of
attentions
,
or
rather
of
professions
,
of
a
somewhat
pointed
*NL*
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Crawford
was
in
the
first
glow
of
another
scheme
about
Thornton
*NL*
Lacey
;
and
not
being
able
to
catch
Edmund
's
ear
,
was
detailing
it
to
his
*NL*
fair
neighbour
with
a
look
of
considerable
earnestness
.
His
scheme
was
*NL*
to
rent
the
house
himself
the
following
winter
,
that
he
might
have
a
*NL*
home
of
his
own
in
that
neighbourhood
;
and
it
was
not
merely
for
the
use
*NL*
of
it
in
the
hunting-season
-LRB-
as
he
was
then
telling
her
-RRB-
,
though
_
that
_
*NL*
consideration
had
certainly
some
weight
,
feeling
as
he
did
that
,
in
*NL*
spite
of
all
Dr.
Grant
's
very
great
kindness
,
it
was
impossible
for
him
*NL*
and
his
horses
to
be
accommodated
where
they
now
were
without
material
*NL*
inconvenience
;
but
his
attachment
to
that
neighbourhood
did
not
depend
*NL*
upon
one
amusement
or
one
season
of
the
year
:
he
had
set
his
heart
upon
*NL*
having
a
something
there
that
he
could
come
to
at
any
time
,
a
little
*NL*
homestall
at
his
command
,
where
all
the
holidays
of
his
year
might
be
*NL*
spent
,
and
he
might
find
himself
continuing
,
improving
,
and
_
perfecting
_
*NL*
that
friendship
and
intimacy
with
the
Mansfield
Park
family
which
was
*NL*
increasing
in
value
to
him
every
day
.
Sir
Thomas
heard
and
was
not
*NL*
offended
.
There
was
no
want
of
respect
in
the
young
man
's
address
;
*NL*
and
Fanny
's
reception
of
it
was
so
proper
and
modest
,
so
calm
and
*NL*
uninviting
,
that
he
had
nothing
to
censure
in
her
.
She
said
little
,
*NL*
assented
only
here
and
there
,
and
betrayed
no
inclination
either
of
*NL*
appropriating
any
part
of
the
compliment
to
herself
,
or
of
strengthening
*NL*
his
views
in
favour
of
Northamptonshire
.
Finding
by
whom
he
was
*NL*
observed
,
Henry
Crawford
addressed
himself
on
the
same
subject
to
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
,
in
a
more
everyday
tone
,
but
still
with
feeling
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
want
to
be
your
neighbour
,
Sir
Thomas
,
as
you
have
,
perhaps
,
heard
me
*NL*
telling
Miss
Price
.
May
I
hope
for
your
acquiescence
,
and
for
your
not
*NL*
influencing
your
son
against
such
a
tenant
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
politely
bowing
,
replied
,
``
It
is
the
only
way
,
sir
,
in
which
*NL*
I
could
_
not
_
wish
you
established
as
a
permanent
neighbour
;
but
I
hope
,
*NL*
and
believe
,
that
Edmund
will
occupy
his
own
house
at
Thornton
Lacey
.
*NL*
Edmund
,
am
I
saying
too
much
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
,
on
this
appeal
,
had
first
to
hear
what
was
going
on
;
but
,
on
*NL*
understanding
the
question
,
was
at
no
loss
for
an
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Certainly
,
sir
,
I
have
no
idea
but
of
residence
.
But
,
Crawford
,
though
*NL*
I
refuse
you
as
a
tenant
,
come
to
me
as
a
friend
.
Consider
the
house
as
*NL*
half
your
own
every
winter
,
and
we
will
add
to
the
stables
on
your
own
*NL*
improved
plan
,
and
with
all
the
improvements
of
your
improved
plan
that
*NL*
may
occur
to
you
this
spring
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
shall
be
the
losers
,
''
continued
Sir
Thomas
.
``
His
going
,
though
only
*NL*
eight
miles
,
will
be
an
unwelcome
contraction
of
our
family
circle
;
but
*NL*
I
should
have
been
deeply
mortified
if
any
son
of
mine
could
reconcile
*NL*
himself
to
doing
less
.
It
is
perfectly
natural
that
you
should
not
have
*NL*
thought
much
on
the
subject
,
Mr.
Crawford
.
But
a
parish
has
wants
and
*NL*
claims
which
can
be
known
only
by
a
clergyman
constantly
resident
,
and
*NL*
which
no
proxy
can
be
capable
of
satisfying
to
the
same
extent
.
Edmund
*NL*
might
,
in
the
common
phrase
,
do
the
duty
of
Thornton
,
that
is
,
he
might
*NL*
read
prayers
and
preach
,
without
giving
up
Mansfield
Park
:
he
might
ride
*NL*
over
every
Sunday
,
to
a
house
nominally
inhabited
,
and
go
through
divine
*NL*
service
;
he
might
be
the
clergyman
of
Thornton
Lacey
every
seventh
day
,
*NL*
for
three
or
four
hours
,
if
that
would
content
him
.
But
it
will
not
.
*NL*
He
knows
that
human
nature
needs
more
lessons
than
a
weekly
sermon
can
*NL*
convey
;
and
that
if
he
does
not
live
among
his
parishioners
,
and
prove
*NL*
himself
,
by
constant
attention
,
their
well-wisher
and
friend
,
he
does
*NL*
very
little
either
for
their
good
or
his
own
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
bowed
his
acquiescence
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
repeat
again
,
''
added
Sir
Thomas
,
``
that
Thornton
Lacey
is
the
only
*NL*
house
in
the
neighbourhood
in
which
I
should
_
not
_
be
happy
to
wait
on
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
as
occupier
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
bowed
his
thanks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Thomas
,
''
said
Edmund
,
``
undoubtedly
understands
the
duty
of
a
parish
*NL*
priest
.
We
must
hope
his
son
may
prove
that
_
he
_
knows
it
too

''
*NL*
*NL*
Whatever
effect
Sir
Thomas
's
little
harangue
might
really
produce
on
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
,
it
raised
some
awkward
sensations
in
two
of
the
others
,
two
*NL*
of
his
most
attentive
listeners
--
Miss
Crawford
and
Fanny
.
One
of
*NL*
whom
,
having
never
before
understood
that
Thornton
was
so
soon
and
so
*NL*
completely
to
be
his
home
,
was
pondering
with
downcast
eyes
on
what
it
*NL*
would
be
_
not
_
to
see
Edmund
every
day
;
and
the
other
,
startled
from
the
*NL*
agreeable
fancies
she
had
been
previously
indulging
on
the
strength
of
*NL*
her
brother
's
description
,
no
longer
able
,
in
the
picture
she
had
*NL*
been
forming
of
a
future
Thornton
,
to
shut
out
the
church
,
sink
the
*NL*
clergyman
,
and
see
only
the
respectable
,
elegant
,
modernised
,
and
*NL*
occasional
residence
of
a
man
of
independent
fortune
,
was
considering
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
with
decided
ill-will
,
as
the
destroyer
of
all
this
,
and
*NL*
suffering
the
more
from
that
involuntary
forbearance
which
his
character
*NL*
and
manner
commanded
,
and
from
not
daring
to
relieve
herself
by
a
single
*NL*
attempt
at
throwing
ridicule
on
his
cause
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
agreeable
of
_
her
_
speculation
was
over
for
that
hour
.
It
was
*NL*
time
to
have
done
with
cards
,
if
sermons
prevailed
;
and
she
was
glad
to
*NL*
find
it
necessary
to
come
to
a
conclusion
,
and
be
able
to
refresh
her
*NL*
spirits
by
a
change
of
place
and
neighbour
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
chief
of
the
party
were
now
collected
irregularly
round
the
*NL*
fire
,
and
waiting
the
final
break-up
.
William
and
Fanny
were
the
most
*NL*
detached
.
They
remained
together
at
the
otherwise
deserted
card-table
,
*NL*
talking
very
comfortably
,
and
not
thinking
of
the
rest
,
till
some
of
the
*NL*
rest
began
to
think
of
them
.
Henry
Crawford
's
chair
was
the
first
to
be
*NL*
given
a
direction
towards
them
,
and
he
sat
silently
observing
them
for
a
*NL*
few
minutes
;
himself
,
in
the
meanwhile
,
observed
by
Sir
Thomas
,
who
was
*NL*
standing
in
chat
with
Dr.
Grant
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
the
assembly
night
,
''
said
William
.
``
If
I
were
at
Portsmouth
I
*NL*
should
be
at
it
,
perhaps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
do
not
wish
yourself
at
Portsmouth
,
William
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
Fanny
,
that
I
do
not
.
I
shall
have
enough
of
Portsmouth
and
of
*NL*
dancing
too
,
when
I
can
not
have
you
.
And
I
do
not
know
that
there
would
*NL*
be
any
good
in
going
to
the
assembly
,
for
I
might
not
get
a
partner
.
*NL*
The
Portsmouth
girls
turn
up
their
noses
at
anybody
who
has
not
a
*NL*
commission
.
One
might
as
well
be
nothing
as
a
midshipman
.
One
_
is
_
*NL*
nothing
,
indeed
.
You
remember
the
Gregorys
;
they
are
grown
up
amazing
*NL*
fine
girls
,
but
they
will
hardly
speak
to
_
me
_
,
because
Lucy
is
courted
*NL*
by
a
lieutenant
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
shame
,
shame
!
But
never
mind
it
,
William
''
-LRB-
her
own
cheeks
in
a
*NL*
glow
of
indignation
as
she
spoke
-RRB-
.
``
It
is
not
worth
minding
.
It
is
no
*NL*
reflection
on
_
you
_
;
it
is
no
more
than
what
the
greatest
admirals
have
*NL*
all
experienced
,
more
or
less
,
in
their
time
.
You
must
think
of
that
,
*NL*
you
must
try
to
make
up
your
mind
to
it
as
one
of
the
hardships
which
*NL*
fall
to
every
sailor
's
share
,
like
bad
weather
and
hard
living
,
only
*NL*
with
this
advantage
,
that
there
will
be
an
end
to
it
,
that
there
will
*NL*
come
a
time
when
you
will
have
nothing

sort

William

any
nonsense

*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

I
am
sure
he
will
do
everything
in
his
power

He

as
well
as
you

*NL*
*NL*
She
was
checked
by
the
sight
of
her
uncle
much
nearer
to
them
than
she
*NL*
had
any
suspicion
of
,
and
each
found
it
necessary
to
talk
of
something
*NL*
else
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
you
fond

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

very
;

many
a

did

when

hand-organ
was
in

street

pretty
good

in
my
way

I
dare
say
you
are
a
better

*NL*
And
turning
to
his
uncle
,
who
was
now
close
to
them
,
``
Is
not
Fanny
a
*NL*
very
good
dancer

*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
in
dismay
at
such
an
unprecedented
question
,
did
not
know
which
*NL*
way
to
look
,
or
how
to
be
prepared
for
the
answer

Some
very
grave
*NL*
reproof
,
or
at

the
coldest
expression
of
indifference
,
must
be
*NL*
coming
to
distress
her
brother

sink
her
to
the
ground

But
,
on
the
*NL*
contrary

it
was
no
worse
than
,
``
I

sorry

never

she
was
a

little
girl
;

I
trust
we
shall
both
think
she
acquits
herself
like

a
gentlewoman
when
we
do
see
her
,
which

perhaps
,
we
may
have
an
*NL*
opportunity

doing

*NL*
``
I
have
had
the
pleasure

leaning
forward

But
I
believe

-LRB-
seeing
Fanny
looked
distressed
-RRB-
``
it
must
be
at
some

other

company

Miss

spoken

''
*NL*
*NL*
True
enough
,
he
had
once
seen
Fanny
dance
;
and
it
was
equally
true
*NL*
that
he
would
now
have
answered
for
her
gliding
about
with
quiet
,
light
*NL*
elegance
,
and
in
admirable
time
;
but
,
in
fact
,
he
could
not
for
the
life
*NL*
of
him
recall
what
her
dancing
had
been
,
and
rather
took
it
for
granted
*NL*
that
she
had
been
present
than
remembered
anything
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
passed
,
however
,
for
an
admirer
of
her
dancing
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
by
no
*NL*
means
displeased
,
prolonged
the
conversation
on
dancing
in
general
,
and
*NL*
was
so
well
engaged
in
describing
the
balls
of
Antigua
,
and
listening
to
*NL*
what
his
nephew
could
relate
of
the
different
modes
of
dancing
which
*NL*
had
fallen
within
his
observation
,
that
he
had
not
heard
his
carriage
*NL*
announced
,
and
was
first
called
to
the
knowledge
of
it
by
the
bustle
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

quick

can
not
bear
to
keep

old
Wilcox

waiting

should
always
remember
the
coachman

horses
.
My
dear
Sir

Thomas
,
we
have
settled
it

the
carriage
should
come
back
for
you

Edmund

William

*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
could
not
dissent
,
as
it
had
been
his
own
arrangement
,
*NL*
previously
communicated
to
his
wife
and
sister
;
but
_
that
_
seemed
*NL*
forgotten
by
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
must
fancy
that
she
settled
it
all
*NL*
herself

*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
last
feeling
in
the
visit
was
disappointment
:
for
the
shawl
*NL*
which
Edmund
was
quietly
taking
from
the
servant
to
bring
and
put
round
*NL*
her
shoulders
was
seized
by
Mr.
Crawford
's
quicker
hand
,

she
was

obliged
to
be
indebted
to
his
more
prominent
attention

CHAPTER
XXVI
*NL*
*NL*
William
's
desire
of
seeing
Fanny
dance
made
more
than
a
momentary
*NL*
impression
on
his
uncle
.
The
hope
of
an
opportunity
,
which
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
had
then
given
,
was
not
given
to
be
thought
of
no
more
.
He
remained
*NL*
steadily
inclined
to
gratify
so
amiable
a
feeling
;
to
gratify
anybody
*NL*
else
who
might
wish
to
see
Fanny
dance
,
and
to
give
pleasure
to
the
*NL*
young
people
in
general
;
and
having
thought
the
matter
over
,
and
taken
*NL*
his
resolution
in
quiet
independence
,
the
result
of
it
appeared
the
*NL*
next
morning
at
breakfast
,
when
,
after
recalling
and
commending
what
*NL*
his
nephew
had
said
,
he
added
,
``
I
do
not
like
,
William
,
that
you
*NL*
should
leave
Northamptonshire
without
this
indulgence
.
It
would
give
me
*NL*
pleasure
to
see
you
both
dance
.
You
spoke
of
the
balls
at
Northampton
.
*NL*
Your
cousins
have
occasionally
attended
them
;
but
they
would
not
*NL*
altogether
suit
us
now
.
The
fatigue
would
be
too
much
for
your
aunt
.
I
*NL*
believe
we
must
not
think
of
a
Northampton
ball
.
A
dance
at
home
would
*NL*
be
more
eligible
;
and
if
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
,
my
dear
Sir
Thomas
!
''
interrupted
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
I
knew
what
was
*NL*
coming
.
I
knew
what
you
were
going
to
say
.
If
dear
Julia
were
at
home
,
*NL*
or
dearest
Mrs.
Rushworth
at
Sotherton
,
to
afford
a
reason
,
an
occasion
*NL*
for
such
a
thing
,
you
would
be
tempted
to
give
the
young
people
a
dance
*NL*
at
Mansfield
.
I
know
you
would
.
If
_
they
_
were
at
home
to
grace
the
*NL*
ball
,
a
ball
you
would
have
this
very
Christmas
.
Thank
your
uncle
,
*NL*
William
,
thank
your
uncle
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
daughters

''
replied
Sir
Thomas
,
gravely
interposing
,
``
have
their
*NL*
pleasures
at
Brighton
,
and
I
hope
are
very
happy

but
the
dance
which
I

think
of
giving
at
Mansfield
will
be
for
their
cousins

Could
we
be
all
*NL*
assembled
,
our
satisfaction
would
undoubtedly
be
more
complete
,
but
the
*NL*
absence
of
some
is
not
to
debar
the
others
of
amusement
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
had
not
another
word
to
say
.
She
saw
decision
in
his
looks
,
*NL*
and
her
surprise
and
vexation
required
some
minutes
'
silence
to
be
*NL*
settled
into
composure
.
A
ball
at
such
a
time
!
His
daughters
absent
and
*NL*
herself
not
consulted
!
There
was
comfort
,
however
,
soon
at
hand
.
_
She
_
*NL*
must
be
the
doer
of
everything
:
Lady
Bertram
would
of
course
be
spared
*NL*
all
thought
and
exertion
,
and
it
would
all
fall
upon
_
her
_
.
She
should
*NL*
have
to
do
the
honours
of
the
evening
;
and
this
reflection
quickly
*NL*
restored
so
much
of
her
good-humour
as
enabled
her
to
join
in
with
the
*NL*
others
,
before
their
happiness
and
thanks
were
all
expressed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
,
William
,
and
Fanny
did
,
in
their
different
ways
,
look
and
speak
*NL*
as
much
grateful
pleasure
in
the
promised
ball
as
Sir
Thomas
could
*NL*
desire
.
Edmund
's
feelings
were
for
the
other
two
.
His
father
had
never
*NL*
conferred
a
favour
or
shewn
a
kindness
more
to
his
satisfaction
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
was
perfectly
quiescent
and
contented
,
and
had
no
*NL*
objections
to
make
.
Sir
Thomas
engaged
for
its
giving
her
very
little
*NL*
trouble
;
and
she
assured
him
``
that
she
was
not
at
all
afraid
of
the
*NL*
trouble
;
indeed
,
she
could
not
imagine
there
would
be
any
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
was
ready
with
her
suggestions
as
to
the
rooms
he
would
*NL*
think
fittest
to
be
used
,
but
found
it
all
prearranged
;
and
when
she
*NL*
would
have
conjectured
and
hinted
about
the
day
,
it
appeared
that
the
*NL*
day
was
settled
too
.
Sir
Thomas
had
been
amusing
himself
with
shaping
a
*NL*
very
complete
outline
of
the
business
;
and
as
soon
as
she
would
listen
*NL*
quietly
,
could
read
his
list
of
the
families
to
be
invited
,
from
whom
*NL*
he
calculated
,
with
all
necessary
allowance
for
the
shortness
of
the
*NL*
notice
,
to
collect
young
people
enough
to
form
twelve
or
fourteen
*NL*
couple
:
and
could
detail
the
considerations
which
had
induced
him
to
*NL*
fix
on
the
22nd
as
the
most
eligible
day
.
William
was
required
to
be
at
*NL*
Portsmouth
on
the
24th
;
the
22nd
would
therefore
be
the
last
day
of
his
*NL*
visit
;
but
where
the
days
were
so
few
it
would
be
unwise
to
fix
on
any
*NL*
earlier
.
Mrs.
Norris
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
thinking
just
the
*NL*
same
,
and
with
having
been
on
the
point
of
proposing
the
22nd
herself
,
*NL*
as
by
far
the
best
day
for
the
purpose
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ball
was
now
a
settled
thing
,
and
before
the
evening
a
proclaimed
*NL*
thing
to
all
whom
it
concerned
.
Invitations
were
sent
with
despatch
,
*NL*
and
many
a
young
lady
went
to
bed
that
night
with
her
head
full
of
happy
*NL*
cares
as
well
as
Fanny
.
To
her
the
cares
were
sometimes
almost
beyond
*NL*
the
happiness
;
for
young
and
inexperienced
,
with
small
means
of
choice
*NL*
and
no
confidence
in
her
own
taste
,
the
``
how
she
should
be
dressed
''
was
*NL*
a
point
of
painful
solicitude
;
and
the
almost
solitary
ornament
in
her
*NL*
possession
,
a
very
pretty
amber
cross
which
William
had
brought
her
from
*NL*
Sicily
,
was
the
greatest
distress
of
all
,
for
she
had
nothing
but
a
bit
*NL*
of
ribbon
to
fasten
it
to
;
and
though
she
had
worn
it
in
that
manner
*NL*
once
,
would
it
be
allowable
at
such
a
time
in
the
midst
of
all
the
rich
*NL*
ornaments
which
she
supposed
all
the
other
young
ladies
would
appear
in
?
*NL*
And
yet
not
to
wear
it
!
William
had
wanted
to
buy
her
a
gold
chain
too
,
*NL*
but
the
purchase
had
been
beyond
his
means
,
and
therefore
not
to
wear
*NL*
the
cross
might
be
mortifying
him
.
These
were
anxious
considerations
;
*NL*
enough
to
sober
her
spirits
even
under
the
prospect
of
a
ball
given
*NL*
principally
for
her
gratification
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
preparations
meanwhile
went
on
,
and
Lady
Bertram
continued
to
sit
on
*NL*
her
sofa
without
any
inconvenience
from
them
.
She
had
some
extra
visits
*NL*
from
the
housekeeper
,
and
her
maid
was
rather
hurried
in
making
up
a
new
*NL*
dress
for
her
:
Sir
Thomas
gave
orders
,
and
Mrs.
Norris
ran
about
;
but
*NL*
all
this
gave
_
her
_
no
trouble
,
and
as
she
had
foreseen
,
``
there
was
,
in
*NL*
fact
,
no
trouble
in
the
business
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
at
this
time
particularly
full
of
cares
:
his
mind
being
*NL*
deeply
occupied
in
the
consideration
of
two
important
events
now
*NL*
at
hand
,
which
were
to
fix
his
fate
in
life
--
ordination
and
*NL*
matrimony
--
events
of
such
a
serious
character
as
to
make
the
ball
,
which
*NL*
would
be
very
quickly
followed
by
one
of
them
,
appear
of
less
moment
in
*NL*
his
eyes
than
in
those
of
any
other
person
in
the
house
.
On
the
23rd
*NL*
he
was
going
to
a
friend
near
Peterborough
,
in
the
same
situation
*NL*
as
himself
,
and
they
were
to
receive
ordination
in
the
course
of
the
*NL*
Christmas
week
.
Half
his
destiny
would
then
be
determined
,
but
the
*NL*
other
half
might
not
be
so
very
smoothly
wooed
.
His
duties
would
be
*NL*
established
,
but
the
wife
who
was
to
share
,
and
animate
,
and
reward
*NL*
those
duties
,
might
yet
be
unattainable
.
He
knew
his
own
mind
,
but
he
*NL*
was
not
always
perfectly
assured
of
knowing
Miss
Crawford
's
.
There
were
*NL*
points
on
which
they
did
not
quite
agree
;
there
were
moments
in
which
*NL*
she
did
not
seem
propitious
;
and
though
trusting
altogether
to
her
*NL*
affection
,
so
far
as
to
be
resolved
--
almost
resolved
--
on
bringing
it
to
*NL*
a
decision
within
a
very
short
time
,
as
soon
as
the
variety
of
business
*NL*
before
him
were
arranged
,
and
he
knew
what
he
had
to
offer
her
,
he
*NL*
had
many
anxious
feelings
,
many
doubting
hours
as
to
the
result
.
His
*NL*
conviction
of
her
regard
for
him
was
sometimes
very
strong
;
he
could
*NL*
look
back
on
a
long
course
of
encouragement
,
and
she
was
as
perfect
in
*NL*
disinterested
attachment
as
in
everything
else
.
But
at
other
times
*NL*
doubt
and
alarm
intermingled
with
his
hopes
;
and
when
he
thought
of
*NL*
her
acknowledged
disinclination
for
privacy
and
retirement
,
her
decided
*NL*
preference
of
a
London
life
,
what
could
he
expect
but
a
determined
*NL*
rejection
?
unless
it
were
an
acceptance
even
more
to
be
deprecated
,
*NL*
demanding
such
sacrifices
of
situation
and
employment
on
his
side
as
*NL*
conscience
must
forbid
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
issue
of
all
depended
on
one
question
.
Did
she
love
him
well
enough
*NL*
to
forego
what
had
used
to
be
essential
points
?
Did
she
love
him
well
*NL*
enough
to
make
them
no
longer
essential
?
And
this
question
,
which
he
was
*NL*
continually
repeating
to
himself
,
though
oftenest
answered
with
a
``
Yes
,
''
*NL*
had
sometimes
its
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
was
soon
to
leave
Mansfield
,
and
on
this
circumstance
the
*NL*
``
no
''
and
the
``
yes
''
had
been
very
recently
in
alternation
.
He
had
seen
*NL*
her
eyes
sparkle
as
she
spoke
of
the
dear
friend
's
letter
,
which
claimed
*NL*
a
long
visit
from
her
in
London
,
and
of
the
kindness
of
Henry
,
in
*NL*
engaging
to
remain
where
he
was
till
January
,
that
he
might
convey
her
*NL*
thither
;
he
had
heard
her
speak
of
the
pleasure
of
such
a
journey
with
*NL*
an
animation
which
had
``
no
''
in
every
tone
.
But
this
had
occurred
on
the
*NL*
first
day
of
its
being
settled
,
within
the
first
hour
of
the
burst
of
*NL*
such
enjoyment
,
when
nothing
but
the
friends
she
was
to
visit
was
before
*NL*
her
.
He
had
since
heard
her
express
herself
differently
,
with
other
*NL*
feelings
,
more
chequered
feelings
:
he
had
heard
her
tell
Mrs.
Grant
that
*NL*
she
should
leave
her
with
regret
;
that
she
began
to
believe
neither
the
*NL*
friends
nor
the
pleasures
she
was
going
to
were
worth
those
she
left
*NL*
behind
;
and
that
though
she
felt
she
must
go
,
and
knew
she
should
enjoy
*NL*
herself
when
once
away
,
she
was
already
looking
forward
to
being
at
*NL*
Mansfield
again
.
Was
there
not
a
``
yes
''
in
all
this
?
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
matters
to
ponder
over
,
and
arrange
,
and
re-arrange
,
Edmund
*NL*
could
not
,
on
his
own
account
,
think
very
much
of
the
evening
which
the
*NL*
rest
of
the
family
were
looking
forward
to
with
a
more
equal
degree
of
*NL*
strong
interest
.
Independent
of
his
two
cousins
'
enjoyment
in
it
,
the
*NL*
evening
was
to
him
of
no
higher
value
than
any
other
appointed
meeting
*NL*
of
the
two
families
might
be
.
In
every
meeting
there
was
a
hope
of
*NL*
receiving
farther
confirmation
of
Miss
Crawford
's
attachment
;
but
the
*NL*
whirl
of
a
ballroom
,
perhaps
,
was
not
particularly
favourable
to
the
*NL*
excitement
or
expression
of
serious
feelings
.
To
engage
her
early
for
*NL*
the
two
first
dances
was
all
the
command
of
individual
happiness
which
*NL*
he
felt
in
his
power
,
and
the
only
preparation
for
the
ball
which
he
*NL*
could
enter
into
,
in
spite
of
all
that
was
passing
around
him
on
the
*NL*
subject
,
from
morning
till
night
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thursday
was
the
day
of
the
ball
;
and
on
Wednesday
morning
Fanny
,
still
*NL*
unable
to
satisfy
herself
as
to
what
she
ought
to
wear
,
determined
to
*NL*
seek
the
counsel
of
the
more
enlightened
,
and
apply
to
Mrs.
Grant
and
*NL*
her
sister
,
whose
acknowledged
taste
would
certainly
bear
her
blameless
;
*NL*
and
as
Edmund
and
William
were
gone
to
Northampton
,
and
she
had
reason
*NL*
to
think
Mr.
Crawford
likewise
out
,
she
walked
down
to
the
Parsonage
*NL*
without
much
fear
of
wanting
an
opportunity
for
private
discussion
;
*NL*
and
the
privacy
of
such
a
discussion
was
a
most
important
part
of
it
to
*NL*
Fanny
,
being
more
than
half-ashamed
of
her
own
solicitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
met
Miss
Crawford
within
a
few
yards
of
the
Parsonage
,
just
setting
*NL*
out
to
call
on
her
,
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
that
her
friend
,
though
*NL*
obliged
to
insist
on
turning
back
,
was
unwilling
to
lose
her
walk
,
she
*NL*
explained
her
business
at
once
,
and
observed
,
that
if
she
would
be
so
*NL*
kind
as
to
give
her
opinion
,
it
might
be
all
talked
over
as
well
without
*NL*
doors
as
within
.
Miss
Crawford
appeared
gratified
by
the
application
,
*NL*
and
after
a
moment
's
thought
,
urged
Fanny
's
returning
with
her
in
a
much
*NL*
more
cordial
manner
than
before
,
and
proposed
their
going
up
into
her
*NL*
room
,
where
they
might
have
a
comfortable
coze
,
without
disturbing
Dr.
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Grant
,
who
were
together
in
the
drawing-room
.
It
was
just
the
*NL*
plan
to
suit
Fanny
;
and
with
a
great
deal
of
gratitude
on
her
side
for
*NL*
such
ready
and
kind
attention
,
they
proceeded
indoors
,
and
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
were
soon
deep
in
the
interesting
subject
.
Miss
Crawford
,
pleased
with
*NL*
the
appeal
,
gave
her
all
her
best
judgment
and
taste
,
made
everything
*NL*
easy
by
her
suggestions
,
and
tried
to
make
everything
agreeable
by
her
*NL*
encouragement
.
The
dress
being
settled
in
all
its
grander
parts
--
``
But
*NL*
what
shall
you
have
by
way
of
necklace
?
''
said
Miss
Crawford
.
``
Shall
not
*NL*
you
wear
your
brother
's
cross
?
''
And
as
she
spoke
she
was
undoing
a
*NL*
small
parcel
,
which
Fanny
had
observed
in
her
hand
when
they
met
.
Fanny
*NL*
acknowledged
her
wishes
and
doubts
on
this
point
:
she
did
not
know
*NL*
how
either
to
wear
the
cross
,
or
to
refrain
from
wearing
it
.
She
was
*NL*
answered
by
having
a
small
trinket-box
placed
before
her
,
and
being
*NL*
requested
to
chuse
from
among
several
gold
chains
and
necklaces
.
Such
*NL*
had
been
the
parcel
with
which
Miss
Crawford
was
provided
,
and
such
the
*NL*
object
of
her
intended
visit
:
and
in
the
kindest
manner
she
now
urged
*NL*
Fanny
's
taking
one
for
the
cross
and
to
keep
for
her
sake
,
saying
*NL*
everything
she
could
think
of
to
obviate
the
scruples
which
were
making
*NL*
Fanny
start
back
at
first
with
a
look
of
horror
at
the
proposal
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
see
what
a
collection
I
have
,
''
said
she
;
``
more
by
half
than
I
ever
*NL*
use
or
think
of
.
I
do
not
offer
them
as
new
.
I
offer
nothing
but
an
old
*NL*
necklace
.
You
must
forgive
the
liberty
,
and
oblige
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
still
resisted
,
and
from
her
heart
.
The
gift
was
too
valuable
.
But
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
persevered
,
and
argued
the
case
with
so
much
affectionate
*NL*
earnestness
through
all
the
heads
of
William
and
the
cross
,
and
the
*NL*
ball
,
and
herself
,
as
to
be
finally
successful
.
Fanny
found
*NL*
herself
obliged
to
yield
,
that
she
might
not
be
accused
of
pride
*NL*
or
indifference
,
or
some
other
littleness
;
and
having
with
modest
*NL*
reluctance
given
her
consent
,
proceeded
to
make
the
selection
.
She
*NL*
looked
and
looked
,
longing
to
know
which
might
be
least
valuable
;
and
*NL*
was
determined
in
her
choice
at
last
,
by
fancying
there
was
one
necklace
*NL*
more
frequently
placed
before
her
eyes
than
the
rest
.
It
was
of
gold
,
*NL*
prettily
worked
;
and
though
Fanny
would
have
preferred
a
longer
and
a
*NL*
plainer
chain
as
more
adapted
for
her
purpose
,
she
hoped
,
in
fixing
*NL*
on
this
,
to
be
chusing
what
Miss
Crawford
least
wished
to
keep
.
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
smiled
her
perfect
approbation
;
and
hastened
to
complete
the
*NL*
gift
by
putting
the
necklace
round
her
,
and
making
her
see
how
well
*NL*
it
looked
.
Fanny
had
not
a
word
to
say
against
its
becomingness
,
and
,
*NL*
excepting
what
remained
of
her
scruples
,
was
exceedingly
pleased
with
*NL*
an
acquisition
so
very
apropos
.
She
would
rather
,
perhaps
,
have
been
*NL*
obliged
to
some
other
person
.
But
this
was
an
unworthy
feeling
.
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
had
anticipated
her
wants
with
a
kindness
which
proved
her
a
*NL*
real
friend
.
``
When
I
wear
this
necklace
I
shall
always
think
of
you
,
''
*NL*
said
she
,
``
and
feel
how
very
kind
you
were
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
think
of
somebody
else
too
,
when
you
wear
that
necklace
,
''
*NL*
replied
Miss
Crawford
.
``
You
must
think
of
Henry
,
for
it
was
his
choice
*NL*
in
the
first
place
.
He
gave
it
to
me
,
and
with
the
necklace
I
make
over
*NL*
to
you
all
the
duty
of
remembering
the
original
giver
.
It
is
to
be
*NL*
a
family
remembrancer
.
The
sister
is
not
to
be
in
your
mind
without
*NL*
bringing
the
brother
too
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
in
great
astonishment
and
confusion
,
would
have
returned
the
*NL*
present
instantly
.
To
take
what
had
been
the
gift
of
another
person
,
*NL*
of
a
brother
too
,
impossible
!
it
must
not
be
!
and
with
an
eagerness
*NL*
and
embarrassment
quite
diverting
to
her
companion
,
she
laid
down
the
*NL*
necklace
again
on
its
cotton
,
and
seemed
resolved
either
to
take
another
*NL*
or
none
at
all
.
Miss
Crawford
thought
she
had
never
seen
a
prettier
*NL*
consciousness
.
``
My
dear
child
,
''
said
she
,
laughing
,
``
what
are
you
afraid
*NL*
of
?
Do
you
think
Henry
will
claim
the
necklace
as
mine
,
and
fancy
you
*NL*
did
not
come
honestly
by
it
?
or
are
you
imagining
he
would
be
too
much
*NL*
flattered
by
seeing
round
your
lovely
throat
an
ornament
which
his
money
*NL*
purchased
three
years
ago
,
before
he
knew
there
was
such
a
throat
in
the
*NL*
world
?
or
perhaps
''
--
looking
archly
--
``
you
suspect
a
confederacy
between
*NL*
us
,
and
that
what
I
am
now
doing
is
with
his
knowledge
and
at
his
*NL*
desire
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
the
deepest
blushes
Fanny
protested
against
such
a
thought
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
replied
Miss
Crawford
more
seriously
,
but
without
at
all
*NL*
believing
her
,
``
to
convince
me
that
you
suspect
no
trick
,
and
are
as
*NL*
unsuspicious
of
compliment
as
I
have
always
found
you
,
take
the
necklace
*NL*
and
say
no
more
about
it
.
Its
being
a
gift
of
my
brother
's
need
not
make
*NL*
the
smallest
difference
in
your
accepting
it
,
as
I
assure
you
it
makes
*NL*
none
in
my
willingness
to
part
with
it
.
He
is
always
giving
me
something
*NL*
or
other
.
I
have
such
innumerable
presents
from
him
that
it
is
quite
*NL*
impossible
for
me
to
value
or
for
him
to
remember
half
.
And
as
for
this
*NL*
necklace
,
I
do
not
suppose
I
have
worn
it
six
times
:
it
is
very
pretty
,
*NL*
but
I
never
think
of
it
;
and
though
you
would
be
most
heartily
welcome
*NL*
to
any
other
in
my
trinket-box
,
you
have
happened
to
fix
on
the
very
*NL*
one
which
,
if
I
have
a
choice
,
I
would
rather
part
with
and
see
in
your
*NL*
possession
than
any
other
.
Say
no
more
against
it
,
I
entreat
you
.
Such
a
*NL*
trifle
is
not
worth
half
so
many
words
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
dared
not
make
any
farther
opposition
;
and
with
renewed
but
less
*NL*
happy
thanks
accepted
the
necklace
again
,
for
there
was
an
expression
in
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
eyes
which
she
could
not
be
satisfied
with
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
impossible
for
her
to
be
insensible
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
change
of
*NL*
manners
.
She
had
long
seen
it
.
He
evidently
tried
to
please
her
:
he
was
*NL*
gallant
,
he
was
attentive
,
he
was
something
like
what
he
had
been
to
her
*NL*
cousins
:
he
wanted
,
she
supposed
,
to
cheat
her
of
her
tranquillity
as
*NL*
he
had
cheated
them
;
and
whether
he
might
not
have
some
concern
in
this
*NL*
necklace
--
she
could
not
be
convinced
that
he
had
not
,
for
Miss
Crawford
,
*NL*
complaisant
as
a
sister
,
was
careless
as
a
woman
and
a
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
Reflecting
and
doubting
,
and
feeling
that
the
possession
of
what
she
had
*NL*
so
much
wished
for
did
not
bring
much
satisfaction
,
she
now
walked
*NL*
home
again
,
with
a
change
rather
than
a
diminution
of
cares
since
her
*NL*
treading
that
path
before
.

CHAPTER
XXVII
*NL*
*NL*
On
reaching
home
Fanny
went
immediately
upstairs
to
deposit
this
*NL*
unexpected
acquisition
,
this
doubtful
good
of
a
necklace
,
in
some
*NL*
favourite
box
in
the
East
room
,
which
held
all
her
smaller
treasures
;
*NL*
but
on
opening
the
door
,
what
was
her
surprise
to
find
her
cousin
Edmund
*NL*
there
writing
at
the
table
!
Such
a
sight
having
never
occurred
before
,
*NL*
was
almost
as
wonderful
as
it
was
welcome
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
,
''
said
he
directly
,
leaving
his
seat
and
his
pen
,
and
meeting
her
*NL*
with
something
in
his
hand
,
``
I
beg
your
pardon
for
being
here
.
I
came
*NL*
to
look
for
you
,
and
after
waiting
a
little
while
in
hope
of
your
coming
*NL*
in
,
was
making
use
of
your
inkstand
to
explain
my
errand
.
You
will
find
*NL*
the
beginning
of
a
note
to
yourself
;
but
I
can
now
speak
my
business
,
*NL*
which
is
merely
to
beg
your
acceptance
of
this
little
trifle
--
a
chain
*NL*
for
William
's
cross
.
You
ought
to
have
had
it
a
week
ago
,
but
there
has
*NL*
been
a
delay
from
my
brother
's
not
being
in
town
by
several
days
so
soon
*NL*
as
I
expected
;
and
I
have
only
just
now
received
it
at
Northampton
.
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
like
the
chain
itself
,
Fanny
.
I
endeavoured
to
consult
the
*NL*
simplicity
of
your
taste
;
but
,
at
any
rate
,
I
know
you
will
be
kind
to
*NL*
my
intentions
,
and
consider
it
,
as
it
really
is
,
a
token
of
the
love
of
*NL*
one
of
your
oldest
friends
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
so
saying
,
he
was
hurrying
away
,
before
Fanny
,
overpowered
by
a
*NL*
thousand
feelings
of
pain
and
pleasure
,
could
attempt
to
speak
;
but
*NL*
quickened
by
one
sovereign
wish
,
she
then
called
out
,
``
Oh
!
cousin
,
stop
*NL*
a
moment
,
pray
stop
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
back
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
attempt
to
thank
you
,
''
she
continued
,
in
a
very
agitated
*NL*
manner
;
``
thanks
are
out
of
the
question
.
I
feel
much
more
than
I
can
*NL*
possibly
express
.
Your
goodness
in
thinking
of
me
in
such
a
way
is
*NL*
beyond
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
,
Fanny
''
smiling
and
turning
away
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
it
is
not
.
I
want
to
consult
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Almost
unconsciously
she
had
now
undone
the
parcel
he
had
just
put
*NL*
into
her
hand
,
and
seeing
before
her
,
in
all
the
niceness
of
jewellers
'
*NL*
packing
,
a
plain
gold
chain
,
perfectly
simple
and
neat
,
she
could
not
*NL*
help
bursting
forth
again
,
``
Oh
,
this
is
beautiful
indeed
!
This
is
the
*NL*
very
thing
,
precisely
what
I
wished
for
!
This
is
the
only
ornament
I
*NL*
have
ever
had
a
desire
to
possess
.
It
will
exactly
suit
my
cross
.
They
*NL*
must
and
shall
be
worn
together
.
It
comes
,
too
,
in
such
an
acceptable
*NL*
moment
.
Oh
,
cousin
,
you
do
not
know
how
acceptable
it
is
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Fanny
,
you
feel
these
things
a
great
deal
too
much
.
I
am
most
*NL*
happy
that
you
like
the
chain
,
and
that
it
should
be
here
in
time
for
*NL*
to-morrow
;
but
your
thanks
are
far
beyond
the
occasion
.
Believe
me
,
I
*NL*
have
no
pleasure
in
the
world
superior
to
that
of
contributing
to
yours
.
*NL*
No
,
I
can
safely
say
,
I
have
no
pleasure
so
complete
,
so
unalloyed
.
It
*NL*
is
without
a
drawback
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Upon
such
expressions
of
affection
Fanny
could
have
lived
an
hour
*NL*
without
saying
another
word
;
but
Edmund
,
after
waiting
a
moment
,
obliged
*NL*
her
to
bring
down
her
mind
from
its
heavenly
flight
by
saying
,
``
But
what
*NL*
is
it
that
you
want
to
consult
me
about
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
about
the
necklace
,
which
she
was
now
most
earnestly
longing
to
*NL*
return
,
and
hoped
to
obtain
his
approbation
of
her
doing
.
She
gave
the
*NL*
history
of
her
recent
visit
,
and
now
her
raptures
might
well
be
over
;
*NL*
for
Edmund
was
so
struck
with
the
circumstance
,
so
delighted
with
what
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
had
done
,
so
gratified
by
such
a
coincidence
of
conduct
*NL*
between
them
,
that
Fanny
could
not
but
admit
the
superior
power
of
one
*NL*
pleasure
over
his
own
mind
,
though
it
might
have
its
drawback
.
It
was
*NL*
some
time
before
she
could
get
his
attention
to
her
plan
,
or
any
answer
*NL*
to
her
demand
of
his
opinion
:
he
was
in
a
reverie
of
fond
reflection
,
*NL*
uttering
only
now
and
then
a
few
half-sentences
of
praise
;
but
when
*NL*
he
did
awake
and
understand
,
he
was
very
decided
in
opposing
what
she
*NL*
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Return
the
necklace
!
No
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
upon
no
account
.
It
would
be
*NL*
mortifying
her
severely
.
There
can
hardly
be
a
more
unpleasant
sensation
*NL*
than
the
having
anything
returned
on
our
hands
which
we
have
given
with
*NL*
a
reasonable
hope
of
its
contributing
to
the
comfort
of
a
friend
.
Why
*NL*
should
she
lose
a
pleasure
which
she
has
shewn
herself
so
deserving
of
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
had
been
given
to
me
in
the
first
instance
,
''
said
Fanny
,
``
I
*NL*
should
not
have
thought
of
returning
it
;
but
being
her
brother
's
*NL*
present
,
is
not
it
fair
to
suppose
that
she
would
rather
not
part
with
*NL*
it
,
when
it
is
not
wanted
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
She
must
not
suppose
it
not
wanted
,
not
acceptable
,
at
least
:
and
its
*NL*
having
been
originally
her
brother
's
gift
makes
no
difference
;
for
as
*NL*
she
was
not
prevented
from
offering
,
nor
you
from
taking
it
on
that
*NL*
account
,
it
ought
not
to
prevent
you
from
keeping
it
.
No
doubt
it
is
*NL*
handsomer
than
mine
,
and
fitter
for
a
ballroom
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
it
is
not
handsomer
,
not
at
all
handsomer
in
its
way
,
and
,
for
*NL*
my
purpose
,
not
half
so
fit
.
The
chain
will
agree
with
William
's
cross
*NL*
beyond
all
comparison
better
than
the
necklace
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
one
night
,
Fanny
,
for
only
one
night
,
if
it
_
be
_
a
sacrifice
;
I
am
*NL*
sure
you
will
,
upon
consideration
,
make
that
sacrifice
rather
than
give
*NL*
pain
to
one
who
has
been
so
studious
of
your
comfort
.
Miss
Crawford
's
*NL*
attentions
to
you
have
been
--
not
more
than
you
were
justly
entitled
*NL*
to
--
I
am
the
last
person
to
think
that
_
could
_
_
be
_
,
but
they
have
been
*NL*
invariable
;
and
to
be
returning
them
with
what
must
have
something
the
*NL*
_
air
_
of
ingratitude
,
though
I
know
it
could
never
have
the
_
meaning
_
,
*NL*
is
not
in
your
nature
,
I
am
sure
.
Wear
the
necklace
,
as
you
are
engaged
*NL*
to
do
,
to-morrow
evening
,
and
let
the
chain
,
which
was
not
ordered
with
*NL*
any
reference
to
the
ball
,
be
kept
for
commoner
occasions
.
This
is
my
*NL*
advice
.
I
would
not
have
the
shadow
of
a
coolness
between
the
two
whose
*NL*
intimacy
I
have
been
observing
with
the
greatest
pleasure
,
and
in
whose
*NL*
characters
there
is
so
much
general
resemblance
in
true
generosity
*NL*
and
natural
delicacy
as
to
make
the
few
slight
differences
,
resulting
*NL*
principally
from
situation
,
no
reasonable
hindrance
to
a
perfect
*NL*
friendship
.
I
would
not
have
the
shadow
of
a
coolness
arise
,
''
he
*NL*
repeated
,
his
voice
sinking
a
little
,
``
between
the
two
dearest
objects
I
*NL*
have
on
earth
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
gone
as
he
spoke
;
and
Fanny
remained
to
tranquillise
herself
as
*NL*
she
could
.
She
was
one
of
his
two
dearest
--
that
must
support
her
.
But
*NL*
the
other
:
the
first
!
She
had
never
heard
him
speak
so
openly
before
,
*NL*
and
though
it
told
her
no
more
than
what
she
had
long
perceived
,
it
was
*NL*
a
stab
,
for
it
told
of
his
own
convictions
and
views
.
They
were
*NL*
decided
.
He
would
marry
Miss
Crawford
.
It
was
a
stab
,
in
spite
of
every
*NL*
long-standing
expectation
;
and
she
was
obliged
to
repeat
again
and
*NL*
again
,
that
she
was
one
of
his
two
dearest
,
before
the
words
gave
her
*NL*
any
sensation
.
Could
she
believe
Miss
Crawford
to
deserve
him
,
it
would
*NL*
be
--
oh
,
how
different
would
it
be
--
how
far
more
tolerable
!
But
he
was
*NL*
deceived
in
her
:
he
gave
her
merits
which
she
had
not
;
her
faults
were
*NL*
what
they
had
ever
been
,
but
he
saw
them
no
longer
.
Till
she
had
shed
*NL*
many
tears
over
this
deception
,
Fanny
could
not
subdue
her
agitation
;
*NL*
and
the
dejection
which
followed
could
only
be
relieved
by
the
influence
*NL*
of
fervent
prayers
for
his
happiness
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
her
intention
,
as
she
felt
it
to
be
her
duty
,
to
try
to
overcome
*NL*
all
that
was
excessive
,
all
that
bordered
on
selfishness
,
in
her
*NL*
affection
for
Edmund
.
To
call
or
to
fancy
it
a
loss
,
a
disappointment
,
*NL*
would
be
a
presumption
for
which
she
had
not
words
strong
enough
to
*NL*
satisfy
her
own
humility
.
To
think
of
him
as
Miss
Crawford
might
be
*NL*
justified
in
thinking
,
would
in
her
be
insanity
.
To
her
he
could
be
*NL*
nothing
under
any
circumstances
;
nothing
dearer
than
a
friend
.
Why
did
*NL*
such
an
idea
occur
to
her
even
enough
to
be
reprobated
and
forbidden
?
It
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
touched
on
the
confines
of
her
imagination
.
She
would
*NL*
endeavour
to
be
rational
,
and
to
deserve
the
right
of
judging
of
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
character
,
and
the
privilege
of
true
solicitude
for
him
by
a
*NL*
sound
intellect
and
an
honest
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
all
the
heroism
of
principle
,
and
was
determined
to
do
her
duty
;
*NL*
but
having
also
many
of
the
feelings
of
youth
and
nature
,
let
her
not
*NL*
be
much
wondered
at
,
if
,
after
making
all
these
good
resolutions
on
the
*NL*
side
of
self-government
,
she
seized
the
scrap
of
paper
on
which
Edmund
*NL*
had
begun
writing
to
her
,
as
a
treasure
beyond
all
her
hopes
,
and
*NL*
reading
with
the
tenderest
emotion
these
words
,
``
My
very
dear
Fanny
,
*NL*
you
must
do
me
the
favour
to
accept
''
locked
it
up
with
the
chain
,
as
the
*NL*
dearest
part
of
the
gift
.
It
was
the
only
thing
approaching
to
a
letter
*NL*
which
she
had
ever
received
from
him
;
she
might
never
receive
another
;
*NL*
it
was
impossible
that
she
ever
should
receive
another
so
perfectly
*NL*
gratifying
in
the
occasion
and
the
style
.
Two
lines
more
prized
had
*NL*
never
fallen
from
the
pen
of
the
most
distinguished
author
--
never
*NL*
more
completely
blessed
the
researches
of
the
fondest
biographer
.
The
*NL*
enthusiasm
of
a
woman
's
love
is
even
beyond
the
biographer
's
.
To
her
,
*NL*
the
handwriting
itself
,
independent
of
anything
it
may
convey
,
is
a
*NL*
blessedness
.
Never
were
such
characters
cut
by
any
other
human
being
as
*NL*
Edmund
's
commonest
handwriting
gave
!
This
specimen
,
written
in
haste
*NL*
as
it
was
,
had
not
a
fault
;
and
there
was
a
felicity
in
the
flow
of
the
*NL*
first
four
words
,
in
the
arrangement
of
``
My
very
dear
Fanny
,
''
which
she
*NL*
could
have
looked
at
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
regulated
her
thoughts
and
comforted
her
feelings
by
this
happy
*NL*
mixture
of
reason
and
weakness
,
she
was
able
in
due
time
to
go
down
*NL*
and
resume
her
usual
employments
near
her
aunt
Bertram
,
and
pay
her
the
*NL*
usual
observances
without
any
apparent
want
of
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thursday
,
predestined
to
hope
and
enjoyment
,
came
;
and
opened
with
*NL*
more
kindness
to
Fanny
than
such
self-willed
,
unmanageable
days
often
*NL*
volunteer
,
for
soon
after
breakfast
a
very
friendly
note
was
brought
*NL*
from
Mr.
Crawford
to
William
,
stating
that
as
he
found
himself
obliged
*NL*
to
go
to
London
on
the
morrow
for
a
few
days
,
he
could
not
help
trying
*NL*
to
procure
a
companion
;
and
therefore
hoped
that
if
William
could
*NL*
make
up
his
mind
to
leave
Mansfield
half
a
day
earlier
than
had
been
*NL*
proposed
,
he
would
accept
a
place
in
his
carriage
.
Mr.
Crawford
meant
to
*NL*
be
in
town
by
his
uncle
's
accustomary
late
dinner-hour
,
and
William
*NL*
was
invited
to
dine
with
him
at
the
Admiral
's
.
The
proposal
was
a
very
*NL*
pleasant
one
to
William
himself
,
who
enjoyed
the
idea
of
travelling
post
*NL*
with
four
horses
,
and
such
a
good-humoured
,
agreeable
friend
;
and
,
in
*NL*
likening
it
to
going
up
with
despatches
,
was
saying
at
once
everything
*NL*
in
favour
of
its
happiness
and
dignity
which
his
imagination
could
*NL*
suggest
;
and
Fanny
,
from
a
different
motive
,
was
exceedingly
pleased
;
*NL*
for
the
original
plan
was
that
William
should
go
up
by
the
mail
from
*NL*
Northampton
the
following
night
,
which
would
not
have
allowed
him
an
*NL*
hour
's
rest
before
he
must
have
got
into
a
Portsmouth
coach
;
and
though
*NL*
this
offer
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
would
rob
her
of
many
hours
of
his
company
,
*NL*
she
was
too
happy
in
having
William
spared
from
the
fatigue
of
such
*NL*
a
journey
,
to
think
of
anything
else
.
Sir
Thomas
approved
of
it
for
*NL*
another
reason
.
His
nephew
's
introduction
to
Admiral
Crawford
might
be
*NL*
of
service
.
The
Admiral
,
he
believed
,
had
interest
.
Upon
the
whole
,
it
*NL*
was
a
very
joyous
note
.
Fanny
's
spirits
lived
on
it
half
the
morning
,
*NL*
deriving
some
accession
of
pleasure
from
its
writer
being
himself
to
go
*NL*
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
the
ball
,
so
near
at
hand
,
she
had
too
many
agitations
and
fears
*NL*
to
have
half
the
enjoyment
in
anticipation
which
she
ought
to
have
had
,
*NL*
or
must
have
been
supposed
to
have
by
the
many
young
ladies
looking
*NL*
forward
to
the
same
event
in
situations
more
at
ease
,
but
under
*NL*
circumstances
of
less
novelty
,
less
interest
,
less
peculiar
*NL*
gratification
,
than
would
be
attributed
to
her
.
Miss
Price
,
known
*NL*
only
by
name
to
half
the
people
invited
,
was
now
to
make
her
first
*NL*
appearance
,
and
must
be
regarded
as
the
queen
of
the
evening
.
Who
could
*NL*
be
happier
than
Miss
Price
?
But
Miss
Price
had
not
been
brought
up
to
*NL*
the
trade
of
_
coming
_
_
out
_
;
and
had
she
known
in
what
light
this
ball
*NL*
was
,
in
general
,
considered
respecting
her
,
it
would
very
much
have
*NL*
lessened
her
comfort
by
increasing
the
fears
she
already
had
of
doing
*NL*
wrong
and
being
looked
at
.
To
dance
without
much
observation
or
any
*NL*
extraordinary
fatigue
,
to
have
strength
and
partners
for
about
half
the
*NL*
evening
,
to
dance
a
little
with
Edmund
,
and
not
a
great
deal
with
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
,
to
see
William
enjoy
himself
,
and
be
able
to
keep
away
*NL*
from
her
aunt
Norris
,
was
the
height
of
her
ambition
,
and
seemed
to
*NL*
comprehend
her
greatest
possibility
of
happiness
.
As
these
were
the
best
*NL*
of
her
hopes
,
they
could
not
always
prevail
;
and
in
the
course
of
a
long
*NL*
morning
,
spent
principally
with
her
two
aunts
,
she
was
often
under
the
*NL*
influence
of
much
less
sanguine
views
.
William
,
determined
to
make
this
*NL*
last
day
a
day
of
thorough
enjoyment
,
was
out
snipe-shooting
;
Edmund
,
*NL*
she
had
too
much
reason
to
suppose
,
was
at
the
Parsonage
;
and
left
*NL*
alone
to
bear
the
worrying
of
Mrs.
Norris
,
who
was
cross
because
the
*NL*
housekeeper
would
have
her
own
way
with
the
supper
,
and
whom
_
she
_
could
*NL*
not
avoid
though
the
housekeeper
might
,
Fanny
was
worn
down
at
last
to
*NL*
think
everything
an
evil
belonging
to
the
ball
,
and
when
sent
off
with
*NL*
a
parting
worry
to
dress
,
moved
as
languidly
towards
her
own
room
,
and
*NL*
felt
as
incapable
of
happiness
as
if
she
had
been
allowed
no
share
in
*NL*
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
she
walked
slowly
upstairs
she
thought
of
yesterday
;
it
had
been
*NL*
about
the
same
hour
that
she
had
returned
from
the
Parsonage
,
and
*NL*
found
Edmund
in
the
East
room
.
``
Suppose
I
were
to
find
him
there
again
*NL*
to-day
!
''
said
she
to
herself
,
in
a
fond
indulgence
of
fancy
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Fanny
,
''
said
a
voice
at
that
moment
near
her
.
Starting
and
looking
up
,
*NL*
she
saw
,
across
the
lobby
she
had
just
reached
,
Edmund
himself
,
standing
*NL*
at
the
head
of
a
different
staircase
.
He
came
towards
her
.
``
You
look
*NL*
tired
and
fagged
,
Fanny
.
You
have
been
walking
too
far
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
have
not
been
out
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
you
have
had
fatigues
within
doors
,
which
are
worse
.
You
had
*NL*
better
have
gone
out
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
not
liking
to
complain
,
found
it
easiest
to
make
no
answer
;
and
*NL*
though
he
looked
at
her
with
his
usual
kindness
,
she
believed
he
had
*NL*
soon
ceased
to
think
of
her
countenance
.
He
did
not
appear
in
spirits
:
*NL*
something
unconnected
with
her
was
probably
amiss
.
They
proceeded
*NL*
upstairs
together
,
their
rooms
being
on
the
same
floor
above
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
come
from
Dr.
Grant
's
,
''
said
Edmund
presently
.
``
You
may
guess
my
*NL*
errand
there
,
Fanny
.
''
And
he
looked
so
conscious
,
that
Fanny
could
think
*NL*
but
of
one
errand
,
which
turned
her
too
sick
for
speech
.
``
I
wished
to
*NL*
engage
Miss
Crawford
for
the
two
first
dances
,
''
was
the
explanation
that
*NL*
followed
,
and
brought
Fanny
to
life
again
,
enabling
her
,
as
she
found
*NL*
she
was
expected
to
speak
,
to
utter
something
like
an
inquiry
as
to
the
*NL*
result
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
he
answered
,
``
she
is
engaged
to
me
;
but
''
-LRB-
with
a
smile
that
did
*NL*
not
sit
easy
-RRB-
``
she
says
it
is
to
be
the
last
time
that
she
ever
will
*NL*
dance
with
me
.
She
is
not
serious
.
I
think
,
I
hope
,
I
am
sure
she
is
*NL*
not
serious
;
but
I
would
rather
not
hear
it
.
She
never
has
danced
with
a
*NL*
clergyman
,
she
says
,
and
she
never
_
will
_
.
For
my
own
sake
,
I
could
wish
*NL*
there
had
been
no
ball
just
at
--
I
mean
not
this
very
week
,
this
very
*NL*
day
;
to-morrow
I
leave
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
struggled
for
speech
,
and
said
,
``
I
am
very
sorry
that
anything
has
*NL*
occurred
to
distress
you
.
This
ought
to
be
a
day
of
pleasure
.
My
uncle
*NL*
meant
it
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
yes
!
and
it
will
be
a
day
of
pleasure
.
It
will
all
end
right
.
I
*NL*
am
only
vexed
for
a
moment
.
In
fact
,
it
is
not
that
I
consider
the
ball
*NL*
as
ill-timed
;
what
does
it
signify
?
But
,
Fanny
,
''
stopping
her
,
by
taking
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
speaking
low
and
seriously
,
``
you
know
what
all
this
means
.
*NL*
You
see
how
it
is
;
and
could
tell
me
,
perhaps
better
than
I
could
tell
*NL*
you
,
how
and
why
I
am
vexed
.
Let
me
talk
to
you
a
little
.
You
are
a
*NL*
kind
,
kind
listener
.
I
have
been
pained
by
her
manner
this
morning
,
and
*NL*
can
not
get
the
better
of
it
.
I
know
her
disposition
to
be
as
sweet
and
*NL*
faultless
as
your
own
,
but
the
influence
of
her
former
companions
*NL*
makes
her
seem
--
gives
to
her
conversation
,
to
her
professed
opinions
,
*NL*
sometimes
a
tinge
of
wrong
.
She
does
not
_
think
_
evil
,
but
she
speaks
*NL*
it
,
speaks
it
in
playfulness
;
and
though
I
know
it
to
be
playfulness
,
it
*NL*
grieves
me
to
the
soul
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
effect
of
education
,
''
said
Fanny
gently
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
could
not
but
agree
to
it
.
``
Yes
,
that
uncle
and
aunt
!
They
have
*NL*
injured
the
finest
mind
;
for
sometimes
,
Fanny
,
I
own
to
you
,
it
does
*NL*
appear
more
than
manner
:
it
appears
as
if
the
mind
itself
was
tainted
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
imagined
this
to
be
an
appeal
to
her
judgment
,
and
therefore
,
*NL*
after
a
moment
's
consideration
,
said
,
``
If
you
only
want
me
as
a
*NL*
listener
,
cousin
,
I
will
be
as
useful
as
I
can
;
but
I
am
not
qualified
*NL*
for
an
adviser
.
Do
not
ask
advice
of
_
me
_
.
I
am
not
competent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
right
,
Fanny
,
to
protest
against
such
an
office
,
but
you
need
*NL*
not
be
afraid
.
It
is
a
subject
on
which
I
should
never
ask
advice
;
it
*NL*
is
the
sort
of
subject
on
which
it
had
better
never
be
asked
;
and
few
,
*NL*
I
imagine
,
do
ask
it
,
but
when
they
want
to
be
influenced
against
their
*NL*
conscience
.
I
only
want
to
talk
to
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
One
thing
more
.
Excuse
the
liberty
;
but
take
care
_
how
_
you
talk
to
me
.
*NL*
Do
not
tell
me
anything
now
,
which
hereafter
you
may
be
sorry
for
.
The
*NL*
time
may
come
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
colour
rushed
into
her
cheeks
as
she
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dearest
Fanny
!
''
cried
Edmund
,
pressing
her
hand
to
his
lips
with
*NL*
almost
as
much
warmth
as
if
it
had
been
Miss
Crawford
's
,
``
you
are
all
*NL*
considerate
thought
!
But
it
is
unnecessary
here
.
The
time
will
never
*NL*
come
.
No
such
time
as
you
allude
to
will
ever
come
.
I
begin
to
think
it
*NL*
most
improbable
:
the
chances
grow
less
and
less
;
and
even
if
it
should
,
*NL*
there
will
be
nothing
to
be
remembered
by
either
you
or
me
that
we
need
*NL*
be
afraid
of
,
for
I
can
never
be
ashamed
of
my
own
scruples
;
and
if
they
*NL*
are
removed
,
it
must
be
by
changes
that
will
only
raise
her
character
*NL*
the
more
by
the
recollection
of
the
faults
she
once
had
.
You
are
the
*NL*
only
being
upon
earth
to
whom
I
should
say
what
I
have
said
;
but
you
*NL*
have
always
known
my
opinion
of
her
;
you
can
bear
me
witness
,
Fanny
,
*NL*
that
I
have
never
been
blinded
.
How
many
a
time
have
we
talked
over
*NL*
her
little
errors
!
You
need
not
fear
me
;
I
have
almost
given
up
every
*NL*
serious
idea
of
her
;
but
I
must
be
a
blockhead
indeed
,
if
,
whatever
*NL*
befell
me
,
I
could
think
of
your
kindness
and
sympathy
without
the
*NL*
sincerest
gratitude
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
said
enough
to
shake
the
experience
of
eighteen
.
He
had
said
*NL*
enough
to
give
Fanny
some
happier
feelings
than
she
had
lately
known
,
*NL*
and
with
a
brighter
look
,
she
answered
,
``
Yes
,
cousin
,
I
am
convinced
*NL*
that
_
you
_
would
be
incapable
of
anything
else
,
though
perhaps
some
*NL*
might
not
.
I
can
not
be
afraid
of
hearing
anything
you
wish
to
say
.
Do
*NL*
not
check
yourself
.
Tell
me
whatever
you
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
now
on
the
second
floor
,
and
the
appearance
of
a
housemaid
*NL*
prevented
any
farther
conversation
.
For
Fanny
's
present
comfort
it
was
*NL*
concluded
,
perhaps
,
at
the
happiest
moment
:
had
he
been
able
to
talk
*NL*
another
five
minutes
,
there
is
no
saying
that
he
might
not
have
talked
*NL*
away
all
Miss
Crawford
's
faults
and
his
own
despondence
.
But
as
it
was
,
*NL*
they
parted
with
looks
on
his
side
of
grateful
affection
,
and
with
*NL*
some
very
precious
sensations
on
hers
.
She
had
felt
nothing
like
it
for
*NL*
hours
.
Since
the
first
joy
from
Mr.
Crawford
's
note
to
William
had
worn
*NL*
away
,
she
had
been
in
a
state
absolutely
the
reverse
;
there
had
been
*NL*
no
comfort
around
,
no
hope
within
her
.
Now
everything
was
smiling
.
*NL*
William
's
good
fortune
returned
again
upon
her
mind
,
and
seemed
of
*NL*
greater
value
than
at
first
.
The
ball
,
too
--
such
an
evening
of
pleasure
*NL*
before
her
!
It
was
now
a
real
animation
;
and
she
began
to
dress
for
it
*NL*
with
much
of
the
happy
flutter
which
belongs
to
a
ball
.
All
went
well
:
*NL*
she
did
not
dislike
her
own
looks
;
and
when
she
came
to
the
necklaces
*NL*
again
,
her
good
fortune
seemed
complete
,
for
upon
trial
the
one
given
*NL*
her
by
Miss
Crawford
would
by
no
means
go
through
the
ring
of
the
cross
.
*NL*
She
had
,
to
oblige
Edmund
,
resolved
to
wear
it
;
but
it
was
too
large
for
*NL*
the
purpose
.
His
,
therefore
,
must
be
worn
;
and
having
,
with
delightful
*NL*
feelings
,
joined
the
chain
and
the
cross
--
those
memorials
of
the
two
*NL*
most
beloved
of
her
heart
,
those
dearest
tokens
so
formed
for
each
other
*NL*
by
everything
real
and
imaginary
--
and
put
them
round
her
neck
,
and
seen
*NL*
and
felt
how
full
of
William
and
Edmund
they
were
,
she
was
able
,
without
*NL*
an
effort
,
to
resolve
on
wearing
Miss
Crawford
's
necklace
too
.
She
*NL*
acknowledged
it
to
be
right
.
Miss
Crawford
had
a
claim
;
and
when
it
was
*NL*
no
longer
to
encroach
on
,
to
interfere
with
the
stronger
claims
,
the
*NL*
truer
kindness
of
another
,
she
could
do
her
justice
even
with
pleasure
*NL*
to
herself
.
The
necklace
really
looked
very
well
;
and
Fanny
left
her
*NL*
room
at
last
,
comfortably
satisfied
with
herself
and
all
about
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
aunt
Bertram
had
recollected
her
on
this
occasion
with
an
unusual
*NL*
degree
of
wakefulness
.
It
had
really
occurred
to
her
,
unprompted
,
that
*NL*
Fanny
,
preparing
for
a
ball
,
might
be
glad
of
better
help
than
the
upper
*NL*
housemaid
's
,
and
when
dressed
herself
,
she
actually
sent
her
own
maid
to
*NL*
assist
her
;
too
late
,
of
course
,
to
be
of
any
use
.
Mrs.
Chapman
had
just
*NL*
reached
the
attic
floor
,
when
Miss
Price
came
out
of
her
room
completely
*NL*
dressed
,
and
only
civilities
were
necessary
;
but
Fanny
felt
her
aunt
's
*NL*
attention
almost
as
much
as
Lady
Bertram
or
Mrs.
Chapman
could
do
*NL*
themselves
.

CHAPTER
XXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Her
uncle
and
both
her
aunts
were
in
the
drawing-room
when
Fanny
went
*NL*
down
.
To
the
former
she
was
an
interesting
object
,
and
he
saw
with
*NL*
pleasure
the
general
elegance
of
her
appearance
,
and
her
being
in
*NL*
remarkably
good
looks
.
The
neatness
and
propriety
of
her
dress
was
all
*NL*
that
he
would
allow
himself
to
commend
in
her
presence
,
but
upon
her
*NL*
leaving
the
room
again
soon
afterwards
,
he
spoke
of
her
beauty
with
very
*NL*
decided
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
,
``
she
looks
very
well
.
I
sent
Chapman
to
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Look
well
!
Oh
,
yes
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
``
she
has
good
reason
to
look
*NL*
well
with
all
her
advantages
:
brought
up
in
this
family
as
she
has
been
,
*NL*
with
all
the
benefit
of
her
cousins
'
manners
before
her
.
Only
think
,
my
*NL*
dear
Sir
Thomas
,
what
extraordinary
advantages
you
and
I
have
been
the
*NL*
means
of
giving
her
.
The
very
gown
you
have
been
taking
notice
of
is
*NL*
your
own
generous
present
to
her
when
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
married
.
What
*NL*
would
she
have
been
if
we
had
not
taken
her
by
the
hand
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
said
no
more
;
but
when
they
sat
down
to
table
the
eyes
of
*NL*
the
two
young
men
assured
him
that
the
subject
might
be
gently
touched
*NL*
again
,
when
the
ladies
withdrew
,
with
more
success
.
Fanny
saw
that
she
*NL*
was
approved
;
and
the
consciousness
of
looking
well
made
her
look
still
*NL*
better
.
From
a
variety
of
causes
she
was
happy
,
and
she
was
soon
made
*NL*
still
happier
;
for
in
following
her
aunts
out
of
the
room
,
Edmund
,
who
*NL*
was
holding
open
the
door
,
said
,
as
she
passed
him
,
``
You
must
dance
*NL*
with
me
,
Fanny
;
you
must
keep
two
dances
for
me
;
any
two
that
you
like
,
*NL*
except
the
first
.
''
She
had
nothing
more
to
wish
for
.
She
had
hardly
*NL*
ever
been
in
a
state
so
nearly
approaching
high
spirits
in
her
life
.
Her
*NL*
cousins
'
former
gaiety
on
the
day
of
a
ball
was
no
longer
surprising
to
*NL*
her
;
she
felt
it
to
be
indeed
very
charming
,
and
was
actually
practising
*NL*
her
steps
about
the
drawing-room
as
long
as
she
could
be
safe
from
the
*NL*
notice
of
her
aunt
Norris
,
who
was
entirely
taken
up
at
first
in
fresh
*NL*
arranging
and
injuring
the
noble
fire
which
the
butler
had
prepared
.
*NL*
*NL*
Half
an
hour
followed
that
would
have
been
at
least
languid
under
any
*NL*
other
circumstances
,
but
Fanny
's
happiness
still
prevailed
.
It
was
but
*NL*
to
think
of
her
conversation
with
Edmund
,
and
what
was
the
restlessness
*NL*
of
Mrs.
Norris
?
What
were
the
yawns
of
Lady
Bertram
?
*NL*
*NL*
The
gentlemen
joined
them
;
and
soon
after
began
the
sweet
expectation
of
*NL*
a
carriage
,
when
a
general
spirit
of
ease
and
enjoyment
seemed
diffused
,
*NL*
and
they
all
stood
about
and
talked
and
laughed
,
and
every
moment
had
*NL*
its
pleasure
and
its
hope
.
Fanny
felt
that
there
must
be
a
struggle
*NL*
in
Edmund
's
cheerfulness
,
but
it
was
delightful
to
see
the
effort
so
*NL*
successfully
made
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
carriages
were
really
heard
,
when
the
guests
began
really
to
*NL*
assemble
,
her
own
gaiety
of
heart
was
much
subdued
:
the
sight
of
so
*NL*
many
strangers
threw
her
back
into
herself
;
and
besides
the
gravity
and
*NL*
formality
of
the
first
great
circle
,
which
the
manners
of
neither
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
nor
Lady
Bertram
were
of
a
kind
to
do
away
,
she
found
herself
*NL*
occasionally
called
on
to
endure
something
worse
.
She
was
introduced
*NL*
here
and
there
by
her
uncle
,
and
forced
to
be
spoken
to
,
and
to
curtsey
,
*NL*
and
speak
again
.
This
was
a
hard
duty
,
and
she
was
never
summoned
to
*NL*
it
without
looking
at
William
,
as
he
walked
about
at
his
ease
in
the
*NL*
background
of
the
scene
,
and
longing
to
be
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
entrance
of
the
Grants
and
Crawfords
was
a
favourable
epoch
.
The
*NL*
stiffness
of
the
meeting
soon
gave
way
before
their
popular
manners
and
*NL*
more
diffused
intimacies
:
little
groups
were
formed
,
and
everybody
grew
*NL*
comfortable
.
Fanny
felt
the
advantage
;
and
,
drawing
back
from
the
toils
*NL*
of
civility
,
would
have
been
again
most
happy
,
could
she
have
kept
her
*NL*
eyes
from
wandering
between
Edmund
and
Mary
Crawford
.
_
She
_
looked
all
*NL*
loveliness
--
and
what
might
not
be
the
end
of
it
?
Her
own
musings
*NL*
were
brought
to
an
end
on
perceiving
Mr.
Crawford
before
her
,
and
*NL*
her
thoughts
were
put
into
another
channel
by
his
engaging
her
almost
*NL*
instantly
for
the
first
two
dances
.
Her
happiness
on
this
occasion
was
*NL*
very
much
_
a
_
_
la
_
_
mortal
_
,
finely
chequered
.
To
be
secure
of
a
partner
*NL*
at
first
was
a
most
essential
good
--
for
the
moment
of
beginning
was
now
*NL*
growing
seriously
near
;
and
she
so
little
understood
her
own
claims
as
*NL*
to
think
that
if
Mr.
Crawford
had
not
asked
her
,
she
must
have
been
the
*NL*
last
to
be
sought
after
,
and
should
have
received
a
partner
only
through
*NL*
a
series
of
inquiry
,
and
bustle
,
and
interference
,
which
would
have
been
*NL*
terrible
;
but
at
the
same
time
there
was
a
pointedness
in
his
manner
of
*NL*
asking
her
which
she
did
not
like
,
and
she
saw
his
eye
glancing
for
*NL*
a
moment
at
her
necklace
,
with
a
smile
--
she
thought
there
was
a
*NL*
smile
--
which
made
her
blush
and
feel
wretched
.
And
though
there
was
no
*NL*
second
glance
to
disturb
her
,
though
his
object
seemed
then
to
be
only
*NL*
quietly
agreeable
,
she
could
not
get
the
better
of
her
embarrassment
,
*NL*
heightened
as
it
was
by
the
idea
of
his
perceiving
it
,
and
had
no
*NL*
composure
till
he
turned
away
to
some
one
else
.
Then
she
could
gradually
*NL*
rise
up
to
the
genuine
satisfaction
of
having
a
partner
,
a
voluntary
*NL*
partner
,
secured
against
the
dancing
began
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
company
were
moving
into
the
ballroom
,
she
found
herself
*NL*
for
the
first
time
near
Miss
Crawford
,
whose
eyes
and
smiles
were
*NL*
immediately
and
more
unequivocally
directed
as
her
brother
's
had
been
,
*NL*
and
who
was
beginning
to
speak
on
the
subject
,
when
Fanny
,
anxious
*NL*
to
get
the
story
over
,
hastened
to
give
the
explanation
of
the
second
*NL*
necklace
:
the
real
chain
.
Miss
Crawford
listened
;
and
all
her
intended
*NL*
compliments
and
insinuations
to
Fanny
were
forgotten
:
she
felt
only
one
*NL*
thing
;
and
her
eyes
,
bright
as
they
had
been
before
,
shewing
they
could
*NL*
yet
be
brighter
,
she
exclaimed
with
eager
pleasure
,
``
Did
he
?
Did
Edmund
?
*NL*
That
was
like
himself
.
No
other
man
would
have
thought
of
it
.
I
honour
*NL*
him
beyond
expression
.
''
And
she
looked
around
as
if
longing
to
tell
him
*NL*
so
.
He
was
not
near
,
he
was
attending
a
party
of
ladies
out
of
the
room
;
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Grant
coming
up
to
the
two
girls
,
and
taking
an
arm
of
each
,
*NL*
they
followed
with
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
heart
sunk
,
but
there
was
no
leisure
for
thinking
long
even
of
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
feelings
.
They
were
in
the
ballroom
,
the
violins
were
*NL*
playing
,
and
her
mind
was
in
a
flutter
that
forbade
its
fixing
on
*NL*
anything
serious
.
She
must
watch
the
general
arrangements
,
and
see
how
*NL*
everything
was
done
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
few
minutes
Sir
Thomas
came
to
her
,
and
asked
if
she
were
engaged
;
*NL*
and
the
``
Yes
,
sir
;
to
Mr.
Crawford
,
''
was
exactly
what
he
had
intended
*NL*
to
hear
.
Mr.
Crawford
was
not
far
off
;
Sir
Thomas
brought
him
to
her
,
*NL*
saying
something
which
discovered
to
Fanny
,
that
_
she
_
was
to
lead
the
*NL*
way
and
open
the
ball
;
an
idea
that
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
.
*NL*
Whenever
she
had
thought
of
the
minutiae
of
the
evening
,
it
had
been
as
*NL*
a
matter
of
course
that
Edmund
would
begin
with
Miss
Crawford
;
and
the
*NL*
impression
was
so
strong
,
that
though
_
her
_
_
uncle
_
spoke
the
contrary
,
*NL*
she
could
not
help
an
exclamation
of
surprise
,
a
hint
of
her
unfitness
,
*NL*
an
entreaty
even
to
be
excused
.
To
be
urging
her
opinion
against
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
's
was
a
proof
of
the
extremity
of
the
case
;
but
such
was
her
*NL*
horror
at
the
first
suggestion
,
that
she
could
actually
look
him
in
*NL*
the
face
and
say
that
she
hoped
it
might
be
settled
otherwise
;
in
vain
,
*NL*
however
:
Sir
Thomas
smiled
,
tried
to
encourage
her
,
and
then
looked
too
*NL*
serious
,
and
said
too
decidedly
,
``
It
must
be
so
,
my
dear
,
''
for
her
to
*NL*
hazard
another
word
;
and
she
found
herself
the
next
moment
conducted
by
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
to
the
top
of
the
room
,
and
standing
there
to
be
joined
by
*NL*
the
rest
of
the
dancers
,
couple
after
couple
,
as
they
were
formed
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
hardly
believe
it
.
To
be
placed
above
so
many
elegant
young
*NL*
women
!
The
distinction
was
too
great
.
It
was
treating
her
like
her
*NL*
cousins
!
And
her
thoughts
flew
to
those
absent
cousins
with
most
*NL*
unfeigned
and
truly
tender
regret
,
that
they
were
not
at
home
to
take
*NL*
their
own
place
in
the
room
,
and
have
their
share
of
a
pleasure
which
*NL*
would
have
been
so
very
delightful
to
them
.
So
often
as
she
had
heard
*NL*
them
wish
for
a
ball
at
home
as
the
greatest
of
all
felicities
!
And
*NL*
to
have
them
away
when
it
was
given
--
and
for
_
her
_
to
be
opening
the
*NL*
ball
--
and
with
Mr.
Crawford
too
!
She
hoped
they
would
not
envy
her
that
*NL*
distinction
_
now
_
;
but
when
she
looked
back
to
the
state
of
things
in
*NL*
the
autumn
,
to
what
they
had
all
been
to
each
other
when
once
dancing
*NL*
in
that
house
before
,
the
present
arrangement
was
almost
more
than
she
*NL*
could
understand
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
ball
began
.
It
was
rather
honour
than
happiness
to
Fanny
,
for
the
*NL*
first
dance
at
least
:
her
partner
was
in
excellent
spirits
,
and
tried
to
*NL*
impart
them
to
her
;
but
she
was
a
great
deal
too
much
frightened
to
have
*NL*
any
enjoyment
till
she
could
suppose
herself
no
longer
looked
at
.
Young
,
*NL*
pretty
,
and
gentle
,
however
,
she
had
no
awkwardnesses
that
were
not
*NL*
as
good
as
graces
,
and
there
were
few
persons
present
that
were
not
*NL*
disposed
to
praise
her
.
She
was
attractive
,
she
was
modest
,
she
was
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
's
niece
,
and
she
was
soon
said
to
be
admired
by
Mr.
Crawford
.
It
*NL*
was
enough
to
give
her
general
favour
.
Sir
Thomas
himself
was
watching
*NL*
her
progress
down
the
dance
with
much
complacency
;
he
was
proud
of
his
*NL*
niece
;
and
without
attributing
all
her
personal
beauty
,
as
Mrs.
Norris
*NL*
seemed
to
do
,
to
her
transplantation
to
Mansfield
,
he
was
pleased
with
*NL*
himself
for
having
supplied
everything
else
:
education
and
manners
she
*NL*
owed
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
saw
much
of
Sir
Thomas
's
thoughts
as
he
stood
,
and
having
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
all
his
wrongs
towards
her
,
a
general
prevailing
desire
of
*NL*
recommending
herself
to
him
,
took
an
opportunity
of
stepping
aside
to
*NL*
say
something
agreeable
of
Fanny
.
Her
praise
was
warm
,
and
he
*NL*
received
it
as
she
could
wish
,
joining
in
it
as
far
as
discretion
,
and
*NL*
politeness
,
and
slowness
of
speech
would
allow
,
and
certainly
appearing
*NL*
to
greater
advantage
on
the
subject
than
his
lady
did
soon
afterwards
,
*NL*
when
Mary
,
perceiving
her
on
a
sofa
very
near
,
turned
round
before
she
*NL*
began
to
dance
,
to
compliment
her
on
Miss
Price
's
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
does
look
very
well
,
''
was
Lady
Bertram
's
placid
reply
.
*NL*
``
Chapman
helped
her
to
dress
.
I
sent
Chapman
to
her
.
''
Not
but
that
*NL*
she
was
really
pleased
to
have
Fanny
admired
;
but
she
was
so
much
more
*NL*
struck
with
her
own
kindness
in
sending
Chapman
to
her
,
that
she
could
*NL*
not
get
it
out
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
knew
Mrs.
Norris
too
well
to
think
of
gratifying
_
her
_
*NL*
by
commendation
of
Fanny
;
to
her
,
it
was
as
the
occasion
offered
--
``
Ah
!
*NL*
ma'am
,
how
much
we
want
dear
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Julia
to-night
!
''
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
paid
her
with
as
many
smiles
and
courteous
words
as
she
had
*NL*
time
for
,
amid
so
much
occupation
as
she
found
for
herself
in
making
*NL*
up
card-tables
,
giving
hints
to
Sir
Thomas
,
and
trying
to
move
all
the
*NL*
chaperons
to
a
better
part
of
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
blundered
most
towards
Fanny
herself
in
her
intentions
*NL*
to
please
.
She
meant
to
be
giving
her
little
heart
a
happy
flutter
,
*NL*
and
filling
her
with
sensations
of
delightful
self-consequence
;
and
,
*NL*
misinterpreting
Fanny
's
blushes
,
still
thought
she
must
be
doing
so
when
*NL*
she
went
to
her
after
the
two
first
dances
,
and
said
,
with
a
significant
*NL*
look
,
``
Perhaps
_
you
_
can
tell
me
why
my
brother
goes
to
town
to-morrow
?
*NL*
He
says
he
has
business
there
,
but
will
not
tell
me
what
.
The
first
time
*NL*
he
ever
denied
me
his
confidence
!
But
this
is
what
we
all
come
to
.
*NL*
All
are
supplanted
sooner
or
later
.
Now
,
I
must
apply
to
you
for
*NL*
information
.
Pray
,
what
is
Henry
going
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
protested
her
ignorance
as
steadily
as
her
embarrassment
allowed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
''
replied
Miss
Crawford
,
laughing
,
``
I
must
suppose
it
to
be
*NL*
purely
for
the
pleasure
of
conveying
your
brother
,
and
of
talking
of
you
*NL*
by
the
way
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
confused
,
but
it
was
the
confusion
of
discontent
;
while
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
wondered
she
did
not
smile
,
and
thought
her
over-anxious
,
*NL*
or
thought
her
odd
,
or
thought
her
anything
rather
than
insensible
of
*NL*
pleasure
in
Henry
's
attentions
.
Fanny
had
a
good
deal
of
enjoyment
in
*NL*
the
course
of
the
evening
;
but
Henry
's
attentions
had
very
little
to
*NL*
do
with
it
.
She
would
much
rather
_
not
_
have
been
asked
by
him
again
so
*NL*
very
soon
,
and
she
wished
she
had
not
been
obliged
to
suspect
that
his
*NL*
previous
inquiries
of
Mrs.
Norris
,
about
the
supper
hour
,
were
all
for
*NL*
the
sake
of
securing
her
at
that
part
of
the
evening
.
But
it
was
not
to
*NL*
be
avoided
:
he
made
her
feel
that
she
was
the
object
of
all
;
though
she
*NL*
could
not
say
that
it
was
unpleasantly
done
,
that
there
was
indelicacy
*NL*
or
ostentation
in
his
manner
;
and
sometimes
,
when
he
talked
of
William
,
*NL*
he
was
really
not
unagreeable
,
and
shewed
even
a
warmth
of
heart
*NL*
which
did
him
credit
.
But
still
his
attentions
made
no
part
of
her
*NL*
satisfaction
.
She
was
happy
whenever
she
looked
at
William
,
and
saw
how
*NL*
perfectly
he
was
enjoying
himself
,
in
every
five
minutes
that
she
could
*NL*
walk
about
with
him
and
hear
his
account
of
his
partners
;
she
was
happy
*NL*
in
knowing
herself
admired
;
and
she
was
happy
in
having
the
two
dances
*NL*
with
Edmund
still
to
look
forward
to
,
during
the
greatest
part
of
the
*NL*
evening
,
her
hand
being
so
eagerly
sought
after
that
her
indefinite
*NL*
engagement
with
_
him
_
was
in
continual
perspective
.
She
was
happy
even
*NL*
when
they
did
take
place
;
but
not
from
any
flow
of
spirits
on
his
side
,
*NL*
or
any
such
expressions
of
tender
gallantry
as
had
blessed
the
morning
.
*NL*
His
mind
was
fagged
,
and
her
happiness
sprung
from
being
the
friend
with
*NL*
whom
it
could
find
repose
.
``
I
am
worn
out
with
civility
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
*NL*
have
been
talking
incessantly
all
night
,
and
with
nothing
to
say
.
But
*NL*
with
_
you
_
,
Fanny
,
there
may
be
peace
.
You
will
not
want
to
be
talked
*NL*
to
.
Let
us
have
the
luxury
of
silence
.
''
Fanny
would
hardly
even
speak
*NL*
her
agreement
.
A
weariness
,
arising
probably
,
in
great
measure
,
from
the
*NL*
same
feelings
which
he
had
acknowledged
in
the
morning
,
was
peculiarly
*NL*
to
be
respected
,
and
they
went
down
their
two
dances
together
with
such
*NL*
sober
tranquillity
as
might
satisfy
any
looker-on
that
Sir
Thomas
had
*NL*
been
bringing
up
no
wife
for
his
younger
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
had
afforded
Edmund
little
pleasure
.
Miss
Crawford
had
*NL*
been
in
gay
spirits
when
they
first
danced
together
,
but
it
was
not
her
*NL*
gaiety
that
could
do
him
good
:
it
rather
sank
than
raised
his
comfort
;
*NL*
and
afterwards
,
for
he
found
himself
still
impelled
to
seek
her
*NL*
again
,
she
had
absolutely
pained
him
by
her
manner
of
speaking
of
the
*NL*
profession
to
which
he
was
now
on
the
point
of
belonging
.
They
had
*NL*
talked
,
and
they
had
been
silent
;
he
had
reasoned
,
she
had
ridiculed
;
*NL*
and
they
had
parted
at
last
with
mutual
vexation
.
Fanny
,
not
able
to
*NL*
refrain
entirely
from
observing
them
,
had
seen
enough
to
be
tolerably
*NL*
satisfied
.
It
was
barbarous
to
be
happy
when
Edmund
was
suffering
.
Yet
*NL*
some
happiness
must
and
would
arise
from
the
very
conviction
that
he
did
*NL*
suffer
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
her
two
dances
with
him
were
over
,
her
inclination
and
strength
for
*NL*
more
were
pretty
well
at
an
end
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
having
seen
her
walk
*NL*
rather
than
dance
down
the
shortening
set
,
breathless
,
and
with
her
hand
*NL*
at
her
side
,
gave
his
orders
for
her
sitting
down
entirely
.
From
that
*NL*
time
Mr.
Crawford
sat
down
likewise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
Fanny
!
''
cried
William
,
coming
for
a
moment
to
visit
her
,
and
*NL*
working
away
his
partner
's
fan
as
if
for
life
,
``
how
soon
she
is
knocked
*NL*
up
!
Why
,
the
sport
is
but
just
begun
.
I
hope
we
shall
keep
it
up
these
*NL*
two
hours
.
How
can
you
be
tired
so
soon
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
So
soon
!
my
good
friend
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
producing
his
watch
with
all
*NL*
necessary
caution
;
``
it
is
three
o'clock
,
and
your
sister
is
not
used
to
*NL*
these
sort
of
hours
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
then
,
Fanny
,
you
shall
not
get
up
to-morrow
before
I
go
.
Sleep
as
*NL*
long
as
you
can
,
and
never
mind
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
William
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
!
Did
she
think
of
being
up
before
you
set
off
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
,
sir
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
rising
eagerly
from
her
seat
to
be
nearer
*NL*
her
uncle
;
``
I
must
get
up
and
breakfast
with
him
.
It
will
be
the
last
*NL*
time
,
you
know
;
the
last
morning
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
had
better
not
.
He
is
to
have
breakfasted
and
be
gone
by
half-past
*NL*
nine
.
Mr.
Crawford
,
I
think
you
call
for
him
at
half-past
nine
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
too
urgent
,
however
,
and
had
too
many
tears
in
her
eyes
for
*NL*
denial
;
and
it
ended
in
a
gracious
``
Well
,
well
!
''
which
was
permission
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
half-past
nine
,
''
said
Crawford
to
William
as
the
latter
was
*NL*
leaving
them
,
``
and
I
shall
be
punctual
,
for
there
will
be
no
kind
sister
*NL*
to
get
up
for
_
me
_
.
''
And
in
a
lower
tone
to
Fanny
,
``
I
shall
have
only
*NL*
a
desolate
house
to
hurry
from
.
Your
brother
will
find
my
ideas
of
time
*NL*
and
his
own
very
different
to-morrow
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
short
consideration
,
Sir
Thomas
asked
Crawford
to
join
the
early
*NL*
breakfast
party
in
that
house
instead
of
eating
alone
:
he
should
himself
*NL*
be
of
it
;
and
the
readiness
with
which
his
invitation
was
accepted
*NL*
convinced
him
that
the
suspicions
whence
,
he
must
confess
to
himself
,
*NL*
this
very
ball
had
in
great
measure
sprung
,
were
well
founded
.
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
was
in
love
with
Fanny
.
He
had
a
pleasing
anticipation
of
what
*NL*
would
be
.
His
niece
,
meanwhile
,
did
not
thank
him
for
what
he
had
just
*NL*
done
.
She
had
hoped
to
have
William
all
to
herself
the
last
morning
.
It
*NL*
would
have
been
an
unspeakable
indulgence
.
But
though
her
wishes
*NL*
were
overthrown
,
there
was
no
spirit
of
murmuring
within
her
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
she
was
so
totally
unused
to
have
her
pleasure
consulted
,
or
*NL*
to
have
anything
take
place
at
all
in
the
way
she
could
desire
,
that
she
*NL*
was
more
disposed
to
wonder
and
rejoice
in
having
carried
her
point
so
*NL*
far
,
than
to
repine
at
the
counteraction
which
followed
.
*NL*
*NL*
Shortly
afterward
,
Sir
Thomas
was
again
interfering
a
little
with
her
*NL*
inclination
,
by
advising
her
to
go
immediately
to
bed
.
``
Advise
''
was
his
*NL*
word
,
but
it
was
the
advice
of
absolute
power
,
and
she
had
only
to
*NL*
rise
,
and
,
with
Mr.
Crawford
's
very
cordial
adieus
,
pass
quietly
away
;
*NL*
stopping
at
the
entrance-door
,
like
the
Lady
of
Branxholm
Hall
,
``
one
*NL*
moment
and
no
more
,
''
to
view
the
happy
scene
,
and
take
a
last
look
at
*NL*
the
five
or
six
determined
couple
who
were
still
hard
at
work
;
and
then
,
*NL*
creeping
slowly
up
the
principal
staircase
,
pursued
by
the
ceaseless
*NL*
country-dance
,
feverish
with
hopes
and
fears
,
soup
and
negus
,
*NL*
sore-footed
and
fatigued
,
restless
and
agitated
,
yet
feeling
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
everything
,
that
a
ball
was
indeed
delightful
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
thus
sending
her
away
,
Sir
Thomas
perhaps
might
not
be
thinking
*NL*
merely
of
her
health
.
It
might
occur
to
him
that
Mr.
Crawford
had
been
*NL*
sitting
by
her
long
enough
,
or
he
might
mean
to
recommend
her
as
a
wife
*NL*
by
shewing
her
persuadableness
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXIX
*NL*
*NL*
The
ball
was
over
,
and
the
breakfast
was
soon
over
too
;
the
last
kiss
*NL*
was
given
,
and
William
was
gone
.
Mr.
Crawford
had
,
as
he
foretold
,
been
*NL*
very
punctual
,
and
short
and
pleasant
had
been
the
meal
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
seeing
William
to
the
last
moment
,
Fanny
walked
back
to
the
*NL*
breakfast-room
with
a
very
saddened
heart
to
grieve
over
the
melancholy
*NL*
change
;
and
there
her
uncle
kindly
left
her
to
cry
in
peace
,
conceiving
,
*NL*
perhaps
,
that
the
deserted
chair
of
each
young
man
might
exercise
her
*NL*
tender
enthusiasm
,
and
that
the
remaining
cold
pork
bones
and
mustard
in
*NL*
William
's
plate
might
but
divide
her
feelings
with
the
broken
egg-shells
*NL*
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
.
She
sat
and
cried
_
con
_
_
amore
_
as
her
uncle
*NL*
intended
,
but
it
was
_
con
_
_
amore
_
fraternal
and
no
other
.
William
was
*NL*
gone
,
and
she
now
felt
as
if
she
had
wasted
half
his
visit
in
idle
cares
*NL*
and
selfish
solicitudes
unconnected
with
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
disposition
was
such
that
she
could
never
even
think
of
her
*NL*
aunt
Norris
in
the
meagreness
and
cheerlessness
of
her
own
small
house
,
*NL*
without
reproaching
herself
for
some
little
want
of
attention
to
her
*NL*
when
they
had
been
last
together
;
much
less
could
her
feelings
acquit
*NL*
her
of
having
done
and
said
and
thought
everything
by
William
that
was
*NL*
due
to
him
for
a
whole
fortnight
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
heavy
,
melancholy
day
.
Soon
after
the
second
breakfast
,
Edmund
*NL*
bade
them
good-bye
for
a
week
,
and
mounted
his
horse
for
Peterborough
,
*NL*
and
then
all
were
gone
.
Nothing
remained
of
last
night
but
remembrances
,
*NL*
which
she
had
nobody
to
share
in
.
She
talked
to
her
aunt
Bertram
--
she
*NL*
must
talk
to
somebody
of
the
ball
;
but
her
aunt
had
seen
so
little
of
*NL*
what
had
passed
,
and
had
so
little
curiosity
,
that
it
was
heavy
work
.
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
was
not
certain
of
anybody
's
dress
or
anybody
's
place
at
*NL*
supper
but
her
own
.
``
She
could
not
recollect
what
it
was
that
she
had
*NL*
heard
about
one
of
the
Miss
Maddoxes
,
or
what
it
was
that
Lady
Prescott
*NL*
had
noticed
in
Fanny
:
she
was
not
sure
whether
Colonel
Harrison
had
been
*NL*
talking
of
Mr.
Crawford
or
of
William
when
he
said
he
was
the
finest
*NL*
young
man
in
the
room
--
somebody
had
whispered
something
to
her
;
she
had
*NL*
forgot
to
ask
Sir
Thomas
what
it
could
be
.
''
And
these
were
her
longest
*NL*
speeches
and
clearest
communications
:
the
rest
was
only
a
languid
``
Yes
,
*NL*
yes
;
very
well
;
did
you
?
did
he
?
I
did
not
see
_
that
_
;
I
should
not
know
*NL*
one
from
the
other
.
''
This
was
very
bad
.
It
was
only
better
than
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
's
sharp
answers
would
have
been
;
but
she
being
gone
home
with
*NL*
all
the
supernumerary
jellies
to
nurse
a
sick
maid
,
there
was
peace
*NL*
and
good-humour
in
their
little
party
,
though
it
could
not
boast
much
*NL*
beside
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
evening
was
heavy
like
the
day
.
``
I
can
not
think
what
is
the
matter
*NL*
with
me
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
,
when
the
tea-things
were
removed
.
``
I
feel
*NL*
quite
stupid
.
It
must
be
sitting
up
so
late
last
night
.
Fanny
,
you
must
*NL*
do
something
to
keep
me
awake
.
I
can
not
work
.
Fetch
the
cards
;
I
feel
so
*NL*
very
stupid
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
cards
were
brought
,
and
Fanny
played
at
cribbage
with
her
aunt
till
*NL*
bedtime
;
and
as
Sir
Thomas
was
reading
to
himself
,
no
sounds
were
*NL*
heard
in
the
room
for
the
next
two
hours
beyond
the
reckonings
of
the
*NL*
game
--
``
And
_
that
_
makes
thirty-one
;
four
in
hand
and
eight
in
crib
.
You
*NL*
are
to
deal
,
ma'am
;
shall
I
deal
for
you
?
''
Fanny
thought
and
thought
*NL*
again
of
the
difference
which
twenty-four
hours
had
made
in
that
room
,
*NL*
and
all
that
part
of
the
house
.
Last
night
it
had
been
hope
and
smiles
,
*NL*
bustle
and
motion
,
noise
and
brilliancy
,
in
the
drawing-room
,
and
out
*NL*
of
the
drawing-room
,
and
everywhere
.
Now
it
was
languor
,
and
all
but
*NL*
solitude
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
good
night
's
rest
improved
her
spirits
.
She
could
think
of
William
the
*NL*
next
day
more
cheerfully
;
and
as
the
morning
afforded
her
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
talking
over
Thursday
night
with
Mrs.
Grant
and
Miss
Crawford
,
in
a
*NL*
very
handsome
style
,
with
all
the
heightenings
of
imagination
,
and
*NL*
all
the
laughs
of
playfulness
which
are
so
essential
to
the
shade
of
a
*NL*
departed
ball
,
she
could
afterwards
bring
her
mind
without
much
effort
*NL*
into
its
everyday
state
,
and
easily
conform
to
the
tranquillity
of
the
*NL*
present
quiet
week
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
indeed
a
smaller
party
than
she
had
ever
known
there
for
*NL*
a
whole
day
together
,
and
_
he
_
was
gone
on
whom
the
comfort
and
*NL*
cheerfulness
of
every
family
meeting
and
every
meal
chiefly
depended
.
*NL*
But
this
must
be
learned
to
be
endured
.
He
would
soon
be
always
gone
;
*NL*
and
she
was
thankful
that
she
could
now
sit
in
the
same
room
with
her
*NL*
uncle
,
hear
his
voice
,
receive
his
questions
,
and
even
answer
them
,
*NL*
without
such
wretched
feelings
as
she
had
formerly
known
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
miss
our
two
young
men
,
''
was
Sir
Thomas
's
observation
on
both
the
*NL*
first
and
second
day
,
as
they
formed
their
very
reduced
circle
after
*NL*
dinner
;
and
in
consideration
of
Fanny
's
swimming
eyes
,
nothing
more
was
*NL*
said
on
the
first
day
than
to
drink
their
good
health
;
but
on
the
*NL*
second
it
led
to
something
farther
.
William
was
kindly
commended
and
*NL*
his
promotion
hoped
for
.
``
And
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
,
''
added
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
,
``
but
that
his
visits
to
us
may
now
be
tolerably
frequent
.
As
to
*NL*
Edmund
,
we
must
learn
to
do
without
him
.
This
will
be
the
last
winter
of
*NL*
his
belonging
to
us
,
as
he
has
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
,
``
but
I
wish
he
was
not
going
away
.
They
are
*NL*
all
going
away
,
I
think
.
I
wish
they
would
stay
at
home
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
wish
was
levelled
principally
at
Julia
,
who
had
just
applied
for
*NL*
permission
to
go
to
town
with
Maria
;
and
as
Sir
Thomas
thought
it
best
*NL*
for
each
daughter
that
the
permission
should
be
granted
,
Lady
Bertram
,
*NL*
though
in
her
own
good-nature
she
would
not
have
prevented
it
,
was
*NL*
lamenting
the
change
it
made
in
the
prospect
of
Julia
's
return
,
which
*NL*
would
otherwise
have
taken
place
about
this
time
.
A
great
deal
of
good
*NL*
sense
followed
on
Sir
Thomas
's
side
,
tending
to
reconcile
his
wife
to
*NL*
the
arrangement
.
Everything
that
a
considerate
parent
_
ought
_
to
feel
*NL*
was
advanced
for
her
use
;
and
everything
that
an
affectionate
mother
*NL*
_
must
_
feel
in
promoting
her
children
's
enjoyment
was
attributed
to
her
*NL*
nature
.
Lady
Bertram
agreed
to
it
all
with
a
calm
``
Yes
''
;
and
at
the
end
*NL*
of
a
quarter
of
an
hour
's
silent
consideration
spontaneously
observed
,
*NL*
``
Sir
Thomas
,
I
have
been
thinking
--
and
I
am
very
glad
we
took
Fanny
as
*NL*
we
did
,
for
now
the
others
are
away
we
feel
the
good
of
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
immediately
improved
this
compliment
by
adding
,
``
Very
true
.
*NL*
We
shew
Fanny
what
a
good
girl
we
think
her
by
praising
her
to
her
face
,
*NL*
she
is
now
a
very
valuable
companion
.
If
we
have
been
kind
to
_
her
_
,
she
*NL*
is
now
quite
as
necessary
to
_
us
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
presently
;
``
and
it
is
a
comfort
to
think
that
*NL*
we
shall
always
have
_
her
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
paused
,
half
smiled
,
glanced
at
his
niece
,
and
then
gravely
*NL*
replied
,
``
She
will
never
leave
us
,
I
hope
,
till
invited
to
some
other
*NL*
home
that
may
reasonably
promise
her
greater
happiness
than
she
knows
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
_
that
_
is
not
very
likely
to
be
,
Sir
Thomas
.
Who
should
invite
her
?
*NL*
Maria
might
be
very
glad
to
see
her
at
Sotherton
now
and
then
,
but
she
*NL*
would
not
think
of
asking
her
to
live
there
;
and
I
am
sure
she
is
better
*NL*
off
here
;
and
besides
,
I
can
not
do
without
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
week
which
passed
so
quietly
and
peaceably
at
the
great
house
in
*NL*
Mansfield
had
a
very
different
character
at
the
Parsonage
.
To
the
young
*NL*
lady
,
at
least
,
in
each
family
,
it
brought
very
different
feelings
.
What
*NL*
was
tranquillity
and
comfort
to
Fanny
was
tediousness
and
vexation
to
*NL*
Mary
.
Something
arose
from
difference
of
disposition
and
habit
:
one
so
*NL*
easily
satisfied
,
the
other
so
unused
to
endure
;
but
still
more
might
be
*NL*
imputed
to
difference
of
circumstances
.
In
some
points
of
interest
they
*NL*
were
exactly
opposed
to
each
other
.
To
Fanny
's
mind
,
Edmund
's
absence
*NL*
was
really
,
in
its
cause
and
its
tendency
,
a
relief
.
To
Mary
it
was
*NL*
every
way
painful
.
She
felt
the
want
of
his
society
every
day
,
almost
*NL*
every
hour
,
and
was
too
much
in
want
of
it
to
derive
anything
but
*NL*
irritation
from
considering
the
object
for
which
he
went
.
He
could
not
*NL*
have
devised
anything
more
likely
to
raise
his
consequence
than
this
*NL*
week
's
absence
,
occurring
as
it
did
at
the
very
time
of
her
brother
's
*NL*
going
away
,
of
William
Price
's
going
too
,
and
completing
the
sort
of
*NL*
general
break-up
of
a
party
which
had
been
so
animated
.
She
felt
it
*NL*
keenly
.
They
were
now
a
miserable
trio
,
confined
within
doors
by
a
*NL*
series
of
rain
and
snow
,
with
nothing
to
do
and
no
variety
to
hope
for
.
*NL*
Angry
as
she
was
with
Edmund
for
adhering
to
his
own
notions
,
and
acting
*NL*
on
them
in
defiance
of
her
-LRB-
and
she
had
been
so
angry
that
they
had
*NL*
hardly
parted
friends
at
the
ball
-RRB-
,
she
could
not
help
thinking
of
*NL*
him
continually
when
absent
,
dwelling
on
his
merit
and
affection
,
and
*NL*
longing
again
for
the
almost
daily
meetings
they
lately
had
.
His
absence
*NL*
was
unnecessarily
long
.
He
should
not
have
planned
such
an
absence
--
he
*NL*
should
not
have
left
home
for
a
week
,
when
her
own
departure
from
*NL*
Mansfield
was
so
near
.
Then
she
began
to
blame
herself
.
She
wished
she
*NL*
had
not
spoken
so
warmly
in
their
last
conversation
.
She
was
afraid
she
*NL*
had
used
some
strong
,
some
contemptuous
expressions
in
speaking
of
the
*NL*
clergy
,
and
that
should
not
have
been
.
It
was
ill-bred
;
it
was
wrong
.
*NL*
She
wished
such
words
unsaid
with
all
her
heart
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
vexation
did
not
end
with
the
week
.
All
this
was
bad
,
but
she
had
*NL*
still
more
to
feel
when
Friday
came
round
again
and
brought
no
Edmund
;
*NL*
when
Saturday
came
and
still
no
Edmund
;
and
when
,
through
the
slight
*NL*
communication
with
the
other
family
which
Sunday
produced
,
she
learned
*NL*
that
he
had
actually
written
home
to
defer
his
return
,
having
promised
*NL*
to
remain
some
days
longer
with
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
If
she
had
felt
impatience
and
regret
before
--
if
she
had
been
sorry
for
*NL*
what
she
said
,
and
feared
its
too
strong
effect
on
him
--
she
now
felt
*NL*
and
feared
it
all
tenfold
more
.
She
had
,
moreover
,
to
contend
with
one
*NL*
disagreeable
emotion
entirely
new
to
her
--
jealousy
.
His
friend
Mr.
*NL*
Owen
had
sisters
;
he
might
find
them
attractive
.
But
,
at
any
rate
,
his
*NL*
staying
away
at
a
time
when
,
according
to
all
preceding
plans
,
she
was
*NL*
to
remove
to
London
,
meant
something
that
she
could
not
bear
.
Had
Henry
*NL*
returned
,
as
he
talked
of
doing
,
at
the
end
of
three
or
four
days
,
she
*NL*
should
now
have
been
leaving
Mansfield
.
It
became
absolutely
necessary
*NL*
for
her
to
get
to
Fanny
and
try
to
learn
something
more
.
She
could
not
*NL*
live
any
longer
in
such
solitary
wretchedness
;
and
she
made
her
way
*NL*
to
the
Park
,
through
difficulties
of
walking
which
she
had
deemed
*NL*
unconquerable
a
week
before
,
for
the
chance
of
hearing
a
little
in
*NL*
addition
,
for
the
sake
of
at
least
hearing
his
name
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
half-hour
was
lost
,
for
Fanny
and
Lady
Bertram
were
together
,
*NL*
and
unless
she
had
Fanny
to
herself
she
could
hope
for
nothing
.
But
*NL*
at
last
Lady
Bertram
left
the
room
,
and
then
almost
immediately
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
thus
began
,
with
a
voice
as
well
regulated
as
she
could
--
``
And
*NL*
how
do
_
you
_
like
your
cousin
Edmund
's
staying
away
so
long
?
Being
the
*NL*
only
young
person
at
home
,
I
consider
_
you
_
as
the
greatest
sufferer
.
*NL*
You
must
miss
him
.
Does
his
staying
longer
surprise
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
,
''
said
Fanny
hesitatingly
.
``
Yes
;
I
had
not
particularly
*NL*
expected
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
he
will
always
stay
longer
than
he
talks
of
.
It
is
the
general
*NL*
way
all
young
men
do
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
did
not
,
the
only
time
he
went
to
see
Mr.
Owen
before
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
He
finds
the
house
more
agreeable
_
now
_
.
He
is
a
very
--
a
very
pleasing
*NL*
young
man
himself
,
and
I
can
not
help
being
rather
concerned
at
not
*NL*
seeing
him
again
before
I
go
to
London
,
as
will
now
undoubtedly
be
the
*NL*
case
.
I
am
looking
for
Henry
every
day
,
and
as
soon
as
he
comes
there
*NL*
will
be
nothing
to
detain
me
at
Mansfield
.
I
should
like
to
have
seen
*NL*
him
once
more
,
I
confess
.
But
you
must
give
my
compliments
to
him
.
Yes
;
*NL*
I
think
it
must
be
compliments
.
Is
not
there
a
something
wanted
,
*NL*
Miss
Price
,
in
our
language
--
a
something
between
compliments
and
--
and
*NL*
love
--
to
suit
the
sort
of
friendly
acquaintance
we
have
had
together
?
So
*NL*
many
months
'
acquaintance
!
But
compliments
may
be
sufficient
here
.
*NL*
Was
his
letter
a
long
one
?
Does
he
give
you
much
account
of
what
he
is
*NL*
doing
?
Is
it
Christmas
gaieties
that
he
is
staying
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
only
heard
a
part
of
the
letter
;
it
was
to
my
uncle
;
but
I
believe
*NL*
it
was
very
short
;
indeed
I
am
sure
it
was
but
a
few
lines
.
All
that
I
*NL*
heard
was
that
his
friend
had
pressed
him
to
stay
longer
,
and
that
he
*NL*
had
agreed
to
do
so
.
A
_
few
_
days
longer
,
or
_
some
_
days
longer
;
I
am
*NL*
not
quite
sure
which
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
if
he
wrote
to
his
father
;
but
I
thought
it
might
have
been
to
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
or
you
.
But
if
he
wrote
to
his
father
,
no
wonder
he
was
concise
.
*NL*
Who
could
write
chat
to
Sir
Thomas
?
If
he
had
written
to
you
,
there
*NL*
would
have
been
more
particulars
.
You
would
have
heard
of
balls
*NL*
and
parties
.
He
would
have
sent
you
a
description
of
everything
and
*NL*
everybody
.
How
many
Miss
Owens
are
there
?

*NL*
*NL*
``

up

*NL*
*NL*
``
Are
they

*NL*
*NL*

I

I

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
is
the
first
question

you
know

''
said
Miss
Crawford
,
trying
to
*NL*
appear
gay
and
unconcerned
,
``
which
every
woman
who
plays
herself
is
sure
*NL*
to
ask
about
another

But
it
is
very
foolish
to
ask
questions
about
*NL*
any
young
ladies
--
about
any
three
sisters
just
grown
up
;
for
one
knows
,
*NL*
without
being
told
,
exactly
what
they
are
:
all
very
accomplished
and
*NL*
pleasing
,
and
one
very
pretty
.
There
is
a
beauty
in
every
family
;
it
is
*NL*
a
regular
thing
.
Two
play
on
the
pianoforte
,
and
one
on
the
harp
;
and
*NL*
all
sing
,
or
would
sing
if
they
were
taught
,
or
sing
all
the
better
for
*NL*
not
being
taught
;
or
something
like
it
.

*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
nothing
of
the
Miss
Owens

said
Fanny
calmly
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
know
nothing

you
care
less

people

Never
did
tone
*NL*
express
indifference
plainer

Indeed
,
how
can
one
care
for
those
one
has
*NL*
never
seen
?
Well
,
when
your
cousin
comes
back
,
he
will
find
Mansfield
*NL*
very
quiet
;
all
the
noisy
ones
gone
,
your
brother
and
mine
and
myself
.
I
*NL*
do
not
like
the
idea
of
leaving
Mrs.
Grant
now
the
time
draws
near
.
She
*NL*
does
not
like
my
going
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
felt
obliged
to
speak
.
``
You
can
not
doubt
your
being
missed
by
*NL*
many
,
''
said
she
.
``
You
will
be
very
much
missed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
turned
her
eye
on
her
,
as
if
wanting
to
hear
or
see
more
,
*NL*
and
then
laughingly
said
,
``
Oh
yes
!
missed
as
every
noisy
evil
is
missed
*NL*
when
it
is
taken
away
;
that
is
,
there
is
a
great
difference
felt
.
But
I
*NL*
am
not
fishing
;
do
n't
compliment
me
.
If
I
_
am
_
missed
,
it
will
appear
.
*NL*
I
may
be
discovered
by
those
who
want
to
see
me
.
I
shall
not
be
in
any
*NL*
doubtful
,
or
distant
,
or
unapproachable
region
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Now
Fanny
could
not
bring
herself
to
speak
,
and
Miss
Crawford
was
*NL*
disappointed
;
for
she
had
hoped
to
hear
some
pleasant
assurance
of
her
*NL*
power
from
one
who
she
thought
must
know
,
and
her
spirits
were
clouded
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Miss
Owens
,
''
said
she
,
soon
afterwards
;
``
suppose
you
were
to
have
*NL*
one
of
the
Miss
Owens
settled
at
Thornton
Lacey
;
how
should
you
like
it
?
*NL*
Stranger
things
have
happened
.
I
dare
say
they
are
trying
for
it
.
And
*NL*
they
are
quite
in
the
right
,
for
it
would
be
a
very
pretty
establishment
*NL*
for
them
.
I
do
not
at
all
wonder
or
blame
them
.
It
is
everybody
's
duty
*NL*
to
do
as
well
for
themselves
as
they
can
.
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
's
son
is
*NL*
somebody
;
and
now
he
is
in
their
own
line
.
Their
father
is
a
clergyman
,
*NL*
and
their
brother
is
a
clergyman
,
and
they
are
all
clergymen
together
.
*NL*
He
is
their
lawful
property
;
he
fairly
belongs
to
them
.
You
do
n't
speak
,
*NL*
Fanny
;
Miss
Price
,
you
do
n't
speak
.
But
honestly
now
,
do
not
you
rather
*NL*
expect
it
than
otherwise
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
''
said
Fanny
stoutly
,
``
I
do
not
expect
it
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
at
all
!
''
cried
Miss
Crawford
with
alacrity
.
``
I
wonder
at
that
.
But
*NL*
I
dare
say
you
know
exactly
--
I
always
imagine
you
are
--
perhaps
you
do
*NL*
not
think
him
likely
to
marry
at
all
--
or
not
at
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
I
do
not
,
''
said
Fanny
softly
,
hoping
she
did
not
err
either
in
the
*NL*
belief
or
the
acknowledgment
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
companion
looked
at
her
keenly
;
and
gathering
greater
spirit
from
*NL*
the
blush
soon
produced
from
such
a
look
,
only
said
,
``
He
is
best
off
as
*NL*
he
is

and
turned
the
subject

CHAPTER
XXX
*NL*
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
uneasiness
was
much
lightened
by
this
conversation
,
and
*NL*
she
walked
home
again
in
spirits
which
might
have
defied
almost
another
*NL*
week
of
the
same
small
party
in
the
same
bad
weather
,
had
they
been
put
*NL*
to
the
proof
;
but
as
that
very
evening
brought
her
brother
down
from
*NL*
London
again
in
quite
,
or
more
than
quite
,
his
usual
cheerfulness
,
she
*NL*
had
nothing
farther
to
try
her
own
.
His
still
refusing
to
tell
her
what
*NL*
he
had
gone
for
was
but
the
promotion
of
gaiety
;
a
day
before
it
might
*NL*
have
irritated
,
but
now
it
was
a
pleasant
joke
--
suspected
only
of
*NL*
concealing
something
planned
as
a
pleasant
surprise
to
herself
.
And
the
*NL*
next
day
_
did
_
bring
a
surprise
to
her
.
Henry
had
said
he
should
just
*NL*
go
and
ask
the
Bertrams
how
they
did
,
and
be
back
in
ten
minutes
,
but
*NL*
he
was
gone
above
an
hour
;
and
when
his
sister
,
who
had
been
waiting
for
*NL*
him
to
walk
with
her
in
the
garden
,
met
him
at
last
most
impatiently
in
*NL*
the
sweep
,
and
cried
out
,
``
My
dear
Henry
,
where
can
you
have
been
*NL*
all
this
time
?
''
he
had
only
to
say
that
he
had
been
sitting
with
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
and
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sitting
with
them
an
hour
and
a
half
!
''
exclaimed
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
was
only
the
beginning
of
her
surprise
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mary
,
''
said
he
,
drawing
her
arm
within
his
,
and
walking
along
*NL*
the
sweep
as
if
not
knowing
where
he
was
:
``
I
could
not
get
away
sooner
;
*NL*
Fanny
looked
so
lovely
!
I
am
quite
determined
,
Mary
.
My
mind
is
entirely
*NL*
made
up
.
Will
it
astonish
you
?
No
:
you
must
be
aware
that
I
am
quite
*NL*
determined
to
marry
Fanny
Price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
surprise
was
now
complete
;
for
,
in
spite
of
whatever
his
*NL*
consciousness
might
suggest
,
a
suspicion
of
his
having
any
such
views
*NL*
had
never
entered
his
sister
's
imagination
;
and
she
looked
so
truly
the
*NL*
astonishment
she
felt
,
that
he
was
obliged
to
repeat
what
he
had
said
,
*NL*
and
more
fully
and
more
solemnly
.
The
conviction
of
his
determination
*NL*
once
admitted
,
it
was
not
unwelcome
.
There
was
even
pleasure
with
the
*NL*
surprise
.
Mary
was
in
a
state
of
mind
to
rejoice
in
a
connexion
with
the
*NL*
Bertram
family
,
and
to
be
not
displeased
with
her
brother
's
marrying
a
*NL*
little
beneath
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
Mary
,
''
was
Henry
's
concluding
assurance
.
``
I
am
fairly
caught
.
*NL*
You
know
with
what
idle
designs
I
began
;
but
this
is
the
end
of
them
.
*NL*
I
have
,
I
flatter
myself
,
made
no
inconsiderable
progress
in
her
*NL*
affections
;
but
my
own
are
entirely
fixed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Lucky
,
lucky
girl
!
''
cried
Mary
,
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
;
``
what
a
*NL*
match
for
her
!
My
dearest
Henry
,
this
must
be
my
_
first
_
feeling
;
but
*NL*
my
_
second
_
,
which
you
shall
have
as
sincerely
,
is
,
that
I
approve
your
*NL*
choice
from
my
soul
,
and
foresee
your
happiness
as
heartily
as
I
wish
*NL*
and
desire
it
.
You
will
have
a
sweet
little
wife
;
all
gratitude
and
*NL*
devotion
.
Exactly
what
you
deserve
.
What
an
amazing
match
for
her
!
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
often
talks
of
her
luck
;
what
will
she
say
now
?
The
delight
*NL*
of
all
the
family
,
indeed
!
And
she
has
some
_
true
_
friends
in
it
!
How
*NL*
_
they
_
will
rejoice
!
But
tell
me
all
about
it
!
Talk
to
me
for
ever
.
When
*NL*
did
you
begin
to
think
seriously
about
her
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
could
be
more
impossible
than
to
answer
such
a
question
,
though
*NL*
nothing
could
be
more
agreeable
than
to
have
it
asked
.
``
How
the
pleasing
*NL*
plague
had
stolen
on
him
''
he
could
not
say
;
and
before
he
had
expressed
*NL*
the
same
sentiment
with
a
little
variation
of
words
three
times
over
,
*NL*
his
sister
eagerly
interrupted
him
with
,
``
Ah
,
my
dear
Henry
,
and
this
*NL*
is
what
took
you
to
London
!
This
was
your
business
!
You
chose
to
consult
*NL*
the
Admiral
before
you
made
up
your
mind
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
this
he
stoutly
denied
.
He
knew
his
uncle
too
well
to
consult
him
on
*NL*
any
matrimonial
scheme
.
The
Admiral
hated
marriage
,
and
thought
it
never
*NL*
pardonable
in
a
young
man
of
independent
fortune
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
When
Fanny
is
known
to
him
,
''
continued
Henry
,
``
he
will
doat
on
her
.
*NL*
She
is
exactly
the
woman
to
do
away
every
prejudice
of
such
a
man
as
*NL*
the
Admiral
,
for
she
he
would
describe
,
if
indeed
he
has
now
delicacy
*NL*
of
language
enough
to
embody
his
own
ideas
.
But
till
it
is
absolutely
*NL*
settled
--
settled
beyond
all
interference
,
he
shall
know
nothing
of
the
*NL*
matter
.
No
,
Mary
,
you
are
quite
mistaken
.
You
have
not
discovered
my
*NL*
business
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
well
,
I
am
satisfied
.
I
know
now
to
whom
it
must
relate
,
and
am
*NL*
in
no
hurry
for
the
rest
.
Fanny
Price
!
wonderful
,
quite
wonderful
!
That
*NL*
Mansfield
should
have
done
so
much
for
--
that
_
you
_
should
have
found
*NL*
your
fate
in
Mansfield
!
But
you
are
quite
right
;
you
could
not
have
*NL*
chosen
better
.
There
is
not
a
better
girl
in
the
world
,
and
you
do
not
*NL*
want
for
fortune
;
and
as
to
her
connexions
,
they
are
more
than
good
.
The
*NL*
Bertrams
are
undoubtedly
some
of
the
first
people
in
this
country
.
She
*NL*
is
niece
to
Sir
Thomas
Bertram
;
that
will
be
enough
for
the
world
.
But
*NL*
go
on
,
go
on
.
Tell
me
more
.
What
are
your
plans
?
Does
she
know
her
own
*NL*
happiness
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
are
you
waiting
for
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
For
--
for
very
little
more
than
opportunity
.
Mary
,
she
is
not
like
her
*NL*
cousins
;
but
I
think
I
shall
not
ask
in
vain
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
you
can
not
.
Were
you
even
less
pleasing
--
supposing
her
not
to
*NL*
love
you
already
-LRB-
of
which
,
however
,
I
can
have
little
doubt
-RRB-
--
you
would
*NL*
be
safe
.
The
gentleness
and
gratitude
of
her
disposition
would
secure
*NL*
her
all
your
own
immediately
.
From
my
soul
I
do
not
think
she
would
*NL*
marry
you
_
without
_
love
;
that
is
,
if
there
is
a
girl
in
the
world
*NL*
capable
of
being
uninfluenced
by
ambition
,
I
can
suppose
it
her
;
but
ask
*NL*
her
to
love
you
,
and
she
will
never
have
the
heart
to
refuse
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
soon
as
her
eagerness
could
rest
in
silence
,
he
was
as
happy
to
tell
*NL*
as
she
could
be
to
listen
;
and
a
conversation
followed
almost
as
deeply
*NL*
interesting
to
her
as
to
himself
,
though
he
had
in
fact
nothing
to
*NL*
relate
but
his
own
sensations
,
nothing
to
dwell
on
but
Fanny
's
charms
.
*NL*
Fanny
's
beauty
of
face
and
figure
,
Fanny
's
graces
of
manner
and
goodness
*NL*
of
heart
,
were
the
exhaustless
theme
.
The
gentleness
,
modesty
,
and
*NL*
sweetness
of
her
character
were
warmly
expatiated
on
;
that
sweetness
*NL*
which
makes
so
essential
a
part
of
every
woman
's
worth
in
the
judgment
*NL*
of
man
,
that
though
he
sometimes
loves
where
it
is
not
,
he
can
never
*NL*
believe
it
absent
.
Her
temper
he
had
good
reason
to
depend
on
and
*NL*
to
praise
.
He
had
often
seen
it
tried
.
Was
there
one
of
the
family
,
*NL*
excepting
Edmund
,
who
had
not
in
some
way
or
other
continually
exercised
*NL*
her
patience
and
forbearance
?
Her
affections
were
evidently
strong
.
To
*NL*
see
her
with
her
brother
!
What
could
more
delightfully
prove
that
the
*NL*
warmth
of
her
heart
was
equal
to
its
gentleness
?
What
could
be
more
*NL*
encouraging
to
a
man
who
had
her
love
in
view
?
Then
,
her
understanding
*NL*
was
beyond
every
suspicion
,
quick
and
clear
;
and
her
manners
were
the
*NL*
mirror
of
her
own
modest
and
elegant
mind
.
Nor
was
this
all
.
Henry
*NL*
Crawford
had
too
much
sense
not
to
feel
the
worth
of
good
principles
*NL*
in
a
wife
,
though
he
was
too
little
accustomed
to
serious
reflection
to
*NL*
know
them
by
their
proper
name
;
but
when
he
talked
of
her
having
such
a
*NL*
steadiness
and
regularity
of
conduct
,
such
a
high
notion
of
honour
,
and
*NL*
such
an
observance
of
decorum
as
might
warrant
any
man
in
the
fullest
*NL*
dependence
on
her
faith
and
integrity
,
he
expressed
what
was
inspired
by
*NL*
the
knowledge
of
her
being
well
principled
and
religious
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
could
so
wholly
and
absolutely
confide
in
her
,
''
said
he
;
``
and
_
that
_
*NL*
is
what
I
want
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Well
might
his
sister
,
believing
as
she
really
did
that
his
opinion
of
*NL*
Fanny
Price
was
scarcely
beyond
her
merits
,
rejoice
in
her
prospects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
more
I
think
of
it
,
''
she
cried
,
``
the
more
am
I
convinced
that
you
*NL*
are
doing
quite
right
;

though
I
should
never
have
selected
Fanny
*NL*
Price
as
the
girl
most
likely
to
attach
you
,
I
am
now
persuaded
she
is
*NL*
the
very
one
to
make
you
happy
.
Your
wicked
project
upon
her
peace
turns
*NL*
out
a
clever
thought
indeed

You
will
both
find
your
good
in
it

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
was
bad
,
very
bad
in
me
against
such
a
creature
;
but
I
did
not
know
*NL*
her
then
;
and
she
shall
have
no
reason
to
lament
the
hour
that
first
put
*NL*
it
into
my
head
.
I
will
make
her
very
happy
,
Mary
;
happier
than
she
has
*NL*
ever
yet
been
herself
,
or
ever
seen
anybody
else
.
I
will
not
take
her
*NL*
from
Northamptonshire
.
I
shall
let
Everingham
,
and
rent
a
place
in
this
*NL*
neighbourhood
;
perhaps
Stanwix
Lodge
.
I
shall
let
a
seven
years

lease
*NL*
of
Everingham

I
am
sure
of
an
excellent
tenant
at
half
a
word

I
could

name
three
people

would
give
me
my

thank
me

Ha

cried
Mary
;

That
is
pleasant

Then
we

shall
be
all
together

*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
spoken
it
,
she
recollected
herself
,
and
wished
it
unsaid
;
*NL*
but
there
was
no
need
of
confusion
;
for
her
brother
saw
her
only
as
the
*NL*
supposed
inmate
of
Mansfield
parsonage
,
and
replied
but
to
invite
her
in
*NL*
the
kindest
manner
to
his
own
house
,
and
to
claim
the
best
right
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
give
us
more
than
half
your
time

he

``
I
can
not
admit

Mrs.

only
to
be

was

now
very
fully
purposed

be
the

neither

My

the
advantage

away

hurt
by
the
contagion

his

have
contracted
any
of

foolish
opinions

learned
to

sit
over
your
dinner

if
it
were
the
best
blessing
of

You

are
*NL*
not
sensible

gain

blinded
you

,
*NL*
in

your

his

is
a

has
been
more

Mary
refrained

that
there

two

this

reflection

on

so
highly

I
know
you

*NL*
*NL*
The
impossibility
of
not
doing
everything
in
the
world
to
make
Fanny
*NL*
Price
happy
,
or
of
ceasing
to
love
Fanny
Price
,
was
of
course
the
*NL*
groundwork
of
his
eloquent
answer

*NL*
*NL*
``
Had
you
seen
her
this
morning

he
continued
,
``

such
ineffable
sweetness

patience

working
with
her

for

her
colour
beautifully

heightened
as
she
leant
over

returning

a

added

after
a
moment

silence

in
a
cooler
tone
;

CHAPTER
XXXI
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Crawford
was
at
Mansfield
Park
again
the
next
morning
,
and
at
an
*NL*
earlier
hour
than
common
visiting
warrants
.
The
two
ladies
were
together
*NL*
in
the
breakfast-room
,
and
,
fortunately
for
him
,
Lady
Bertram
was
on
the
*NL*
very
point
of
quitting
it
as
he
entered
.
She
was
almost
at
the
door
,
and
*NL*
not
chusing
by
any
means
to
take
so
much
trouble
in
vain
,
she
still
went
*NL*
on
,
after
a
civil
reception
,
a
short
sentence
about
being
waited
for
,
*NL*
and
a
``
Let
Sir
Thomas
know
''
to
the
servant
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
,
overjoyed
to
have
her
go
,
bowed
and
watched
her
off
,
and
without
*NL*
losing
another
moment
,
turned
instantly
to
Fanny
,
and
,
taking
out
some
*NL*
letters
,
said
,
with
a
most
animated
look
,
``
I
must
acknowledge
myself
*NL*
infinitely
obliged
to
any
creature
who
gives
me
such
an
opportunity
*NL*
of
seeing
you
alone
:
I
have
been
wishing
it
more
than
you
can
have
any
*NL*
idea
.
Knowing
as
I
do
what
your
feelings
as
a
sister
are
,
I
could
hardly
*NL*
have
borne
that
any
one
in
the
house
should
share
with
you
in
the
*NL*
first
knowledge
of
the
news
I
now
bring
.
He
is
made
.
Your
brother
is
a
*NL*
lieutenant
.
I
have
the
infinite
satisfaction
of
congratulating
you
on
*NL*
your
brother
's
promotion
.
Here
are
the
letters
which
announce
it
,
this
*NL*
moment
come
to
hand
.
You
will
,
perhaps
,
like
to
see
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
speak
,
but
he
did
not
want
her
to
speak
.
To
see
the
*NL*
expression
of
her
eyes
,
the
change
of
her
complexion
,
the
progress
of
*NL*
her
feelings
,
their
doubt
,
confusion
,
and
felicity
,
was
enough
.
She
took
*NL*
the
letters
as
he
gave
them
.
The
first
was
from
the
Admiral
to
inform
*NL*
his
nephew
,
in
a
few
words
,
of
his
having
succeeded
in
the
object
he
had
*NL*
undertaken
,
the
promotion
of
young
Price
,
and
enclosing
two
more
,
one
*NL*
from
the
Secretary
of
the
First
Lord
to
a
friend
,
whom
the
Admiral
had
*NL*
set
to
work
in
the
business
,
the
other
from
that
friend
to
himself
,
*NL*
by
which
it
appeared
that
his
lordship
had
the
very
great
happiness
of
*NL*
attending
to
the
recommendation
of
Sir
Charles
;
that
Sir
Charles
was
*NL*
much
delighted
in
having
such
an
opportunity
of
proving
his
regard
*NL*
for
Admiral
Crawford
,
and
that
the
circumstance
of
Mr.
William
Price
's
*NL*
commission
as
Second
Lieutenant
of
H.M.
Sloop
Thrush
being
made
out
was
*NL*
spreading
general
joy
through
a
wide
circle
of
great
people
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
her
hand
was
trembling
under
these
letters
,
her
eye
running
from
*NL*
one
to
the
other
,
and
her
heart
swelling
with
emotion
,
Crawford
thus
*NL*
continued
,
with
unfeigned
eagerness
,
to
express
his
interest
in
the
*NL*
event
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
talk
of
my
own
happiness
,
''
said
he
,
``
great
as
it
is
,
for
I
*NL*
think
only
of
yours
.
Compared
with
you
,
who
has
a
right
to
be
happy
?
I
*NL*
have
almost
grudged
myself
my
own
prior
knowledge
of
what
you
ought
to
*NL*
have
known
before
all
the
world
.
I
have
not
lost
a
moment
,
however
.
*NL*
The
post
was
late
this
morning
,
but
there
has
not
been
since
a
moment
's
*NL*
delay
.
How
impatient
,
how
anxious
,
how
wild
I
have
been
on
the
subject
,
*NL*
I
will
not
attempt
to
describe
;
how
severely
mortified
,
how
cruelly
*NL*
disappointed
,
in
not
having
it
finished
while
I
was
in
London
!
I
was
*NL*
kept
there
from
day
to
day
in
the
hope
of
it
,
for
nothing
less
dear
*NL*
to
me
than
such
an
object
would
have
detained
me
half
the
time
from
*NL*
Mansfield
.
But
though
my
uncle
entered
into
my
wishes
with
all
the
*NL*
warmth
I
could
desire
,
and
exerted
himself
immediately
,
there
were
*NL*
difficulties
from
the
absence
of
one
friend
,
and
the
engagements
of
*NL*
another
,
which
at
last
I
could
no
longer
bear
to
stay
the
end
of
,
and
*NL*
knowing
in
what
good
hands
I
left
the
cause
,
I
came
away
on
Monday
,
*NL*
trusting
that
many
posts
would
not
pass
before
I
should
be
followed
by
*NL*
such
very
letters
as
these
.
My
uncle
,
who
is
the
very
best
man
in
*NL*
the
world
,
has
exerted
himself
,
as
I
knew
he
would
,
after
seeing
your
*NL*
brother
.
He
was
delighted
with
him
.
I
would
not
allow
myself
yesterday
*NL*
to
say
how
delighted
,
or
to
repeat
half
that
the
Admiral
said
in
his
*NL*
praise
.
I
deferred
it
all
till
his
praise
should
be
proved
the
praise
of
*NL*
a
friend
,
as
this
day
_
does
_
prove
it
.
_
Now
_
I
may
say
that
even
I
could
*NL*
not
require
William
Price
to
excite
a
greater
interest
,
or
be
followed
*NL*
by
warmer
wishes
and
higher
commendation
,
than
were
most
voluntarily
*NL*
bestowed
by
my
uncle
after
the
evening
they
had
passed
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Has
this
been
all
_
your
_
doing
,
then
?
''
cried
Fanny
.
``
Good
heaven
!
how
*NL*
very
,
very
kind
!
Have
you
really

it
by
_
your
_
desire
?
I
beg
your
*NL*
pardon
,
but
I
am
bewildered
.
Did
Admiral
Crawford
apply
?
How
was
it
?
I
*NL*
am
stupefied
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
was
most
happy
to
make
it
more
intelligible
,
by
beginning
at
an
*NL*
earlier
stage
,
and
explaining
very
particularly
what
he
had
done
.
His
*NL*
last
journey
to
London
had
been
undertaken
with
no
other
view
than
that
*NL*
of
introducing
her
brother
in
Hill
Street
,
and
prevailing
on
the
Admiral
*NL*
to
exert
whatever
interest
he
might
have
for
getting
him
on
.
This
had
*NL*
been
his
business
.
He
had
communicated
it
to
no
creature
:
he
had
not
*NL*
breathed
a
syllable
of
it
even
to
Mary
;
while
uncertain
of
the
issue
,
*NL*
he
could
not
have
borne
any
participation
of
his
feelings
,
but
this
had
*NL*
been
his
business
;
and
he
spoke
with
such
a
glow
of
what
his
solicitude
*NL*
had
been
,
and
used
such
strong
expressions
,
was
so
abounding
in
the
*NL*
_
deepest
_
_
interest
_
,
in
_
twofold
_
_
motives
_
,
in
_
views
_
_
and
_
_
wishes
_
*NL*
_
more
_
_
than
_
_
could
_
_
be
_
_
told
_
,
that
Fanny
could
not
have
remained
*NL*
insensible
of
his
drift
,
had
she
been
able
to
attend
;
but
her
heart
was
*NL*
so
full
and
her
senses
still
so
astonished
,
that
she
could
listen
but
*NL*
imperfectly
even
to
what
he
told
her
of
William
,
and
saying
only
when
*NL*
he
paused
,
``
How
kind
!
how
very
kind
!
Oh
,
Mr.
Crawford
,
we
are
infinitely
*NL*
obliged
to
you
!
Dearest
,
dearest
William
!
''
She
jumped
up
and
moved
in
*NL*
haste
towards
the
door
,
crying
out
,
``
I
will
go
to
my
uncle
.
My
uncle
*NL*
ought
to
know
it
as
soon
as
possible
.
''
But
this
could
not
be
suffered
.
*NL*
The
opportunity
was
too
fair
,
and
his
feelings
too
impatient
.
He
was
*NL*
after
her
immediately
.
``
She
must
not
go
,
she
must
allow
him
five
minutes
*NL*
longer
,
''
and
he
took
her
hand
and
led
her
back
to
her
seat
,
and
was
in
*NL*
the
middle
of
his
farther
explanation
,
before
she
had
suspected
for
what
*NL*
she
was
detained
.
When
she
did
understand
it
,
however
,
and
found
herself
*NL*
expected
to
believe
that
she
had
created
sensations
which
his
heart
had
*NL*
never
known
before
,
and
that
everything
he
had
done
for
William
was
to
*NL*
be
placed
to
the
account
of
his
excessive
and
unequalled
attachment
*NL*
to
her
,
she
was
exceedingly
distressed
,
and
for
some
moments
unable
*NL*
to
speak
.
She
considered
it
all
as
nonsense
,
as
mere
trifling
and
*NL*
gallantry
,
which
meant
only
to
deceive
for
the
hour
;
she
could
not
but
*NL*
feel
that
it
was
treating
her
improperly
and
unworthily
,
and
in
such
a
*NL*
way
as
she
had
not
deserved
;
but
it
was
like
himself
,
and
entirely
of
a
*NL*
piece
with
what
she
had
seen
before
;
and
she
would
not
allow
herself
to
*NL*
shew
half
the
displeasure
she
felt
,
because
he
had
been
conferring
an
*NL*
obligation
,
which
no
want
of
delicacy
on
his
part
could
make
a
trifle
*NL*
to
her
.
While
her
heart
was
still
bounding
with
joy
and
gratitude
on
*NL*
William
's
behalf
,
she
could
not
be
severely
resentful
of
anything
that
*NL*
injured
only
herself
;
and
after
having
twice
drawn
back
her
hand
,
and
*NL*
twice
attempted
in
vain
to
turn
away
from
him
,
she
got
up
,
and
said
*NL*
only
,
with
much
agitation
,
``
Do
n't
,
Mr.
Crawford
,
pray
do
n't
!
I
beg
you
*NL*
would
not
.
This
is
a
sort
of
talking
which
is
very
unpleasant
to
me
.
I
*NL*
must
go
away
.
I
can
not
bear
it
.
''
But
he
was
still
talking
on
,
describing
*NL*
his
affection
,
soliciting
a
return
,
and
,
finally
,
in
words
so
plain
as
*NL*
to
bear
but
one
meaning
even
to
her
,
offering
himself
,
hand
,
fortune
,
*NL*
everything
,
to
her
acceptance
.
It
was
so
;
he
had
said
it
.
Her
*NL*
astonishment
and
confusion
increased
;
and
though
still
not
knowing
*NL*
how
to
suppose
him
serious
,
she
could
hardly
stand
.
He
pressed
for
an
*NL*
answer
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
no
,
no
!
''
she
cried
,
hiding
her
face
.
``
This
is
all
nonsense
.
Do
not
*NL*
distress
me
.
I
can
hear
no
more
of
this
.
Your
kindness
to
William
makes
*NL*
me
more
obliged
to
you
than
words
can
express
;
but
I
do
not
want
,
I
*NL*
can
not
bear
,
I
must
not
listen
to
such
--
No
,
no
,
do
n't
think
of
me
.
But
*NL*
you
are
_
not
_
thinking
of
me
.
I
know
it
is
all
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
burst
away
from
him
,
and
at
that
moment
Sir
Thomas
was
heard
*NL*
speaking
to
a
servant
in
his
way
towards
the
room
they
were
in
.
It
was
*NL*
no
time
for
farther
assurances
or
entreaty
,
though
to
part
with
her
at
*NL*
a
moment
when
her
modesty
alone
seemed
,
to
his
sanguine
and
preassured
*NL*
mind
,
to
stand
in
the
way
of
the
happiness
he
sought
,
was
a
cruel
*NL*
necessity
.
She
rushed
out
at
an
opposite
door
from
the
one
her
uncle
*NL*
was
approaching
,
and
was
walking
up
and
down
the
East
room
in
the
*NL*
utmost
confusion
of
contrary
feeling
,
before
Sir
Thomas
's
politeness
*NL*
or
apologies
were
over
,
or
he
had
reached
the
beginning
of
the
joyful
*NL*
intelligence
which
his
visitor
came
to
communicate
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
feeling
,
thinking
,
trembling
about
everything
;
agitated
,
happy
,
*NL*
miserable
,
infinitely
obliged
,
absolutely
angry
.
It
was
all
beyond
*NL*
belief
!
He
was
inexcusable
,
incomprehensible
!
But
such
were
his
habits
*NL*
that
he
could
do
nothing
without
a
mixture
of
evil
.
He
had
previously
*NL*
made
her
the
happiest
of
human
beings
,
and
now
he
had
insulted
--
she
knew
*NL*
not
what
to
say
,
how
to
class
,
or
how
to
regard
it
.
She
would
not
have
*NL*
him
be
serious
,
and
yet
what
could
excuse
the
use
of
such
words
and
*NL*
offers
,
if
they
meant
but
to
trifle
?
*NL*
*NL*
But
William
was
a
lieutenant
.
_
That
_
was
a
fact
beyond
a
doubt
,
and
*NL*
without
an
alloy
.
She
would
think
of
it
for
ever
and
forget
all
the
*NL*
rest
.
Mr.
Crawford
would
certainly
never
address
her
so
again
:
he
must
*NL*
have
seen
how
unwelcome
it
was
to
her
;
and
in
that
case
,
how
gratefully
*NL*
she
could
esteem
him
for
his
friendship
to
William
!
*NL*
*NL*
She
would
not
stir
farther
from
the
East
room
than
the
head
of
the
great
*NL*
staircase
,
till
she
had
satisfied
herself
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
having
left
*NL*
the
house
;
but
when
convinced
of
his
being
gone
,
she
was
eager
to
go
*NL*
down
and
be
with
her
uncle
,
and
have
all
the
happiness
of
his
joy
*NL*
as
well
as
her
own
,
and
all
the
benefit
of
his
information
or
his
*NL*
conjectures
as
to
what
would
now
be
William
's
destination
.
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
was
as
joyful
as
she
could
desire
,
and
very
kind
and
communicative
;
and
*NL*
she
had
so
comfortable
a
talk
with
him
about
William
as
to
make
her
*NL*
feel
as
if
nothing
had
occurred
to
vex
her
,
till
she
found
,
towards
the
*NL*
close
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
was
engaged
to
return
and
dine
there
that
*NL*
very
day
.
This
was
a
most
unwelcome
hearing
,
for
though
he
might
think
*NL*
nothing
of
what
had
passed
,
it
would
be
quite
distressing
to
her
to
see
*NL*
him
again
so
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
tried
to
get
the
better
of
it
;
tried
very
hard
,
as
the
dinner
hour
*NL*
approached
,
to
feel
and
appear
as
usual
;
but
it
was
quite
impossible
for
*NL*
her
not
to
look
most
shy
and
uncomfortable
when
their
visitor
entered
*NL*
the
room
.
She
could
not
have
supposed
it
in
the
power
of
any
concurrence
*NL*
of
circumstances
to
give
her
so
many
painful
sensations
on
the
first
day
*NL*
of
hearing
of
William
's
promotion
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
was
not
only
in
the
room
--
he
was
soon
close
to
her
.
He
*NL*
had
a
note
to
deliver
from
his
sister
.
Fanny
could
not
look
at
him
,
but
*NL*
there
was
no
consciousness
of
past
folly
in
his
voice
.
She
opened
her
*NL*
note
immediately
,
glad
to
have
anything
to
do
,
and
happy
,
as
she
read
*NL*
it
,
to
feel
that
the
fidgetings
of
her
aunt
Norris
,
who
was
also
to
dine
*NL*
there
,
screened
her
a
little
from
view
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Fanny
,
--
for
so
I
may
now
always
call
you
,
to
the
infinite
*NL*
relief
of
a
tongue
that
has
been
stumbling
at
_
Miss
_
_
Price
_
for
at
*NL*
least
the
last
six
weeks
--
I
can
not
let
my
brother
go
without
sending
you
*NL*
a
few
lines
of
general
congratulation
,
and
giving
my
most
joyful
consent
*NL*
and
approval
.
Go
on
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
and
without
fear
;
there
can
be
no
*NL*
difficulties
worth
naming
.
I
chuse
to
suppose
that
the
assurance
of
my
*NL*
consent
will
be
something
;
so
you
may
smile
upon
him
with
your
sweetest
*NL*
smiles
this
afternoon
,
and
send
him
back
to
me
even
happier
than
he
*NL*
goes
.
--
Yours
affectionately
,
M.
C.
''
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
not
expressions
to
do
Fanny
any
good
;
for
though
she
read
*NL*
in
too
much
haste
and
confusion
to
form
the
clearest
judgment
of
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
meaning
,
it
was
evident
that
she
meant
to
compliment
her
on
*NL*
her
brother
's
attachment
,
and
even
to
_
appear
_
to
believe
it
serious
.
*NL*
She
did
not
know
what
to
do
,
or
what
to
think
.
There
was
wretchedness
in
*NL*
the
idea
of
its
being
serious
;
there
was
perplexity
and
agitation
every
*NL*
way
.
She
was
distressed
whenever
Mr.
Crawford
spoke
to
her
,
and
he
spoke
*NL*
to
her
much
too
often
;
and
she
was
afraid
there
was
a
something
in
his
*NL*
voice
and
manner
in
addressing
her
very
different
from
what
they
were
*NL*
when
he
talked
to
the
others
.
Her
comfort
in
that
day
's
dinner
was
*NL*
quite
destroyed
:
she
could
hardly
eat
anything
;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
good-humouredly
observed
that
joy
had
taken
away
her
appetite
,
she
*NL*
was
ready
to
sink
with
shame
,
from
the
dread
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
*NL*
interpretation
;
for
though
nothing
could
have
tempted
her
to
turn
*NL*
her
eyes
to
the
right
hand
,
where
he
sat
,
she
felt
that
_
his
_
were
*NL*
immediately
directed
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
more
silent
than
ever
.
She
would
hardly
join
even
when
William
*NL*
was
the
subject
,
for
his
commission
came
all
from
the
right
hand
too
,
*NL*
and
there
was
pain
in
the
connexion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
Lady
Bertram
sat
longer
than
ever
,
and
began
to
be
in
*NL*
despair
of
ever
getting
away
;
but
at
last
they
were
in
the
drawing-room
,
*NL*
and
she
was
able
to
think
as
she
would
,
while
her
aunts
finished
the
*NL*
subject
of
William
's
appointment
in
their
own
style
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
seemed
as
much
delighted
with
the
saving
it
would
be
to
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
as
with
any
part
of
it
.
''
_
Now
_
William
would
be
able
to
keep
*NL*
himself
,
which
would
make
a
vast
difference
to
his
uncle
,
for
it
was
*NL*
unknown
how
much
he
had
cost
his
uncle
;
and
,
indeed
,
it
would
make
some
*NL*
difference
in
_
her
_
presents
too
.
She
was
very
glad
that
she
had
given
*NL*
William
what
she
did
at
parting
,
very
glad
,
indeed
,
that
it
had
been
in
*NL*
her
power
,
without
material
inconvenience
,
just
at
that
time
to
give
him
*NL*
something
rather
considerable
;
that
is
,
for
_
her
_
,
with
_
her
_
limited
*NL*
means
,
for
now
it
would
all
be
useful
in
helping
to
fit
up
his
cabin
.
*NL*
She
knew
he
must
be
at
some
expense
,
that
he
would
have
many
things
to
*NL*
buy
,
though
to
be
sure
his
father
and
mother
would
be
able
to
put
him
in
*NL*
the
way
of
getting
everything
very
cheap
;
but
she
was
very
glad
she
had
*NL*
contributed
her
mite
towards
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
glad
you
gave
him
something
considerable
,
''
said
Lady
Bertram
,
with
*NL*
most
unsuspicious
calmness
,
``
for
_
I
_
gave
him
only
10
pounds
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Norris
,
reddening
.
``
Upon
my
word
,
he
must
have
gone
*NL*
off
with
his
pockets
well
lined
,
and
at
no
expense
for
his
journey
to
*NL*
London
either
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
Thomas
told
me
10
pounds
would
be
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
being
not
at
all
inclined
to
question
its
sufficiency
,
*NL*
began
to
take
the
matter
in
another
point
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
amazing
,
''
said
she
,
``
how
much
young
people
cost
their
friends
,
*NL*
what
with
bringing
them
up
and
putting
them
out
in
the
world
!
They
*NL*
little
think
how
much
it
comes
to
,
or
what
their
parents
,
or
their
*NL*
uncles
and
aunts
,
pay
for
them
in
the
course
of
the
year
.
Now
,
here
are
*NL*
my
sister
Price
's
children
;
take
them
all
together
,
I
dare
say
nobody
*NL*
would
believe
what
a
sum
they
cost
Sir
Thomas
every
year
,
to
say
nothing
*NL*
of
what
_
I
_
do
for
them
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
true
,
sister
,
as
you
say
.
But
,
poor
things
!
they
can
not
help
*NL*
it
;
and
you
know
it
makes
very
little
difference
to
Sir
Thomas
.
Fanny
,
*NL*
William
must
not
forget
my
shawl
if
he
goes
to
the
East
Indies
;
and
I
*NL*
shall
give
him
a
commission
for
anything
else
that
is
worth
having
.
I
*NL*
wish
he
may
go
to
the
East
Indies
,
that
I
may
have
my
shawl
.
I
think
I
*NL*
will
have
two
shawls
,
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
meanwhile
,
speaking
only
when
she
could
not
help
it
,
was
very
*NL*
earnestly
trying
to
understand
what
Mr.
and
Miss
Crawford
were
at
.
There
*NL*
was
everything
in
the
world
_
against
_
their
being
serious
but
his
words
*NL*
and
manner
.
Everything
natural
,
probable
,
reasonable
,
was
against
it
;
*NL*
all
their
habits
and
ways
of
thinking
,
and
all
her
own
demerits
.
How
*NL*
could
_
she
_
have
excited
serious
attachment
in
a
man
who
had
seen
so
*NL*
many
,
and
been
admired
by
so
many
,
and
flirted
with
so
many
,
infinitely
*NL*
her
superiors
;
who
seemed
so
little
open
to
serious
impressions
,
even
*NL*
where
pains
had
been
taken
to
please
him
;
who
thought
so
slightly
,
so
*NL*
carelessly
,
so
unfeelingly
on
all
such
points
;
who
was
everything
to
*NL*
everybody
,
and
seemed
to
find
no
one
essential
to
him
?
And
farther
,
*NL*
how
could
it
be
supposed
that
his
sister
,
with
all
her
high
and
worldly
*NL*
notions
of
matrimony
,
would
be
forwarding
anything
of
a
serious
nature
*NL*
in
such
a
quarter
?
Nothing
could
be
more
unnatural
in
either
.
Fanny
*NL*
was
ashamed
of
her
own
doubts
.
Everything
might
be
possible
rather
than
*NL*
serious
attachment
,
or
serious
approbation
of
it
toward
her
.
She
had
*NL*
quite
convinced
herself
of
this
before
Sir
Thomas
and
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
joined
them
.
The
difficulty
was
in
maintaining
the
conviction
quite
so
*NL*
absolutely
after
Mr.
Crawford
was
in
the
room
;
for
once
or
twice
a
*NL*
look
seemed
forced
on
her
which
she
did
not
know
how
to
class
among
the
*NL*
common
meaning
;
in
any
other
man
,
at
least
,
she
would
have
said
that
*NL*
it
meant
something
very
earnest
,
very
pointed
.
But
she
still
tried
to
*NL*
believe
it
no
more
than
what
he
might
often
have
expressed
towards
her
*NL*
cousins
and
fifty
other
women
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
thought
he
was
wishing
to
speak
to
her
unheard
by
the
rest
.
She
*NL*
fancied
he
was
trying
for
it
the
whole
evening
at
intervals
,
whenever
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
out
of
the
room
,
or
at
all
engaged
with
Mrs.
Norris
,
and
*NL*
she
carefully
refused
him
every
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
last
--
it
seemed
an
at
last
to
Fanny
's
nervousness
,
though
not
*NL*
remarkably
late
--
he
began
to
talk
of
going
away
;
but
the
comfort
of
the
*NL*
sound
was
impaired
by
his
turning
to
her
the
next
moment
,
and
saying
,
*NL*
``
Have
you
nothing
to
send
to
Mary
?
No
answer
to
her
note
?
She
will
be
*NL*
disappointed
if
she
receives
nothing
from
you
.
Pray
write
to
her
,
if
it
*NL*
be
only
a
line
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
!
certainly
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
rising
in
haste
,
the
haste
of
*NL*
embarrassment
and
of
wanting
to
get
away
--
``
I
will
write
directly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
went
accordingly
to
the
table
,
where
she
was
in
the
habit
of
writing
*NL*
for
her
aunt
,
and
prepared
her
materials
without
knowing
what
in
the
*NL*
world
to
say
.
She
had
read
Miss
Crawford
's
note
only
once
,
and
how
to
*NL*
reply
to
anything
so
imperfectly
understood
was
most
distressing
.
*NL*
Quite
unpractised
in
such
sort
of
note-writing
,
had
there
been
time
for
*NL*
scruples
and
fears
as
to
style
she
would
have
felt
them
in
abundance
:
*NL*
but
something
must
be
instantly
written
;
and
with
only
one
decided
*NL*
feeling
,
that
of
wishing
not
to
appear
to
think
anything
really
*NL*
intended
,
she
wrote
thus
,
in
great
trembling
both
of
spirits
and
hand
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
,
my
dear
Miss
Crawford
,
for
your
kind
*NL*
congratulations
,
as
far
as
they
relate
to
my
dearest
William
.
The
rest
*NL*
of
your
note
I
know
means
nothing
;
but
I
am
so
unequal
to
anything
of
*NL*
the
sort
,
that
I
hope
you
will
excuse
my
begging
you
to
take
no
farther
*NL*
notice
.
I
have
seen
too
much
of
Mr.
Crawford
not
to
understand
his
*NL*
manners
;
if
he
understood
me
as
well
,
he
would
,
I
dare
say
,
behave
*NL*
differently
.
I
do
not
know
what
I
write
,
but
it
would
be
a
great
favour
*NL*
of
you
never
to
mention
the
subject
again
.
With
thanks
for
the
honour
of
*NL*
your
note
,
I
remain
,
dear
Miss
Crawford
,
etc.
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
was
scarcely
intelligible
from
increasing
fright
,
for
*NL*
she
found
that
Mr.
Crawford
,
under
pretence
of
receiving
the
note
,
was
*NL*
coming
towards
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
can
not
think
I
mean
to
hurry
you
,
''
said
he
,
in
an
undervoice
,
*NL*
perceiving
the
amazing
trepidation
with
which
she
made
up
the
note
,
``
you
*NL*
can
not
think
I
have
any
such
object
.
Do
not
hurry
yourself
,
I
entreat
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
I
thank
you
;
I
have
quite
done
,
just
done
;
it
will
be
ready
in
a
*NL*
moment
;
I
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
;
if
you
will
be
so
good
as
to
give
*NL*
_
that
_
to
Miss
Crawford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
note
was
held
out
,
and
must
be
taken
;
and
as
she
instantly
and
with
*NL*
averted
eyes
walked
towards
the
fireplace
,
where
sat
the
others
,
he
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
but
to
go
in
good
earnest
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
thought
she
had
never
known
a
day
of
greater
agitation
,
both
of
*NL*
pain
and
pleasure
;
but
happily
the
pleasure
was
not
of
a
sort
to
die
*NL*
with
the
day
;
for
every
day
would
restore
the
knowledge
of
William
's
*NL*
advancement
,
whereas
the
pain
,
she
hoped
,
would
return
no
more
.
She
had
*NL*
no
doubt
that
her
note
must
appear
excessively
ill-written
,
that
*NL*
the
language
would
disgrace
a
child
,
for
her
distress
had
allowed
no
*NL*
arrangement
;
but
at
least
it
would
assure
them
both
of
her
being
neither
*NL*
imposed
on
nor
gratified
by
Mr.
Crawford
's
attentions
.
*NL*

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXII
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
had
by
no
means
forgotten
Mr.
Crawford
when
she
awoke
the
next
*NL*
morning
;
but
she
remembered
the
purport
of
her
note
,
and
was
not
less
*NL*
sanguine
as
to
its
effect
than
she
had
been
the
night
before
.
If
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
would
but
go
away
!
That
was
what
she
most
earnestly
desired
:
*NL*
go
and
take
his
sister
with
him
,
as
he
was
to
do
,
and
as
he
returned
to
*NL*
Mansfield
on
purpose
to
do
.
And
why
it
was
not
done
already
she
could
*NL*
not
devise
,
for
Miss
Crawford
certainly
wanted
no
delay
.
Fanny
had
*NL*
hoped
,
in
the
course
of
his
yesterday
's
visit
,
to
hear
the
day
named
;
*NL*
but
he
had
only
spoken
of
their
journey
as
what
would
take
place
ere
*NL*
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
so
satisfactorily
settled
the
conviction
her
note
would
convey
,
*NL*
she
could
not
but
be
astonished
to
see
Mr.
Crawford
,
as
she
accidentally
*NL*
did
,
coming
up
to
the
house
again
,
and
at
an
hour
as
early
as
the
day
*NL*
before
.
His
coming
might
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
,
but
she
must
avoid
*NL*
seeing
him
if
possible
;
and
being
then
on
her
way
upstairs
,
she
resolved
*NL*
there
to
remain
,
during
the
whole
of
his
visit
,
unless
actually
sent
*NL*
for
;
and
as
Mrs.
Norris
was
still
in
the
house
,
there
seemed
little
*NL*
danger
of
her
being
wanted
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
sat
some
time
in
a
good
deal
of
agitation
,
listening
,
trembling
,
and
*NL*
fearing
to
be
sent
for
every
moment
;
but
as
no
footsteps
approached
the
*NL*
East
room
,
she
grew
gradually
composed
,
could
sit
down
,
and
be
able
to
*NL*
employ
herself
,
and
able
to
hope
that
Mr.
Crawford
had
come
and
would
go
*NL*
without
her
being
obliged
to
know
anything
of
the
matter
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nearly
half
an
hour
had
passed
,
and
she
was
growing
very
comfortable
,
*NL*
when
suddenly
the
sound
of
a
step
in
regular
approach
was
heard
;
a
heavy
*NL*
step
,
an
unusual
step
in
that
part
of
the
house
:
it
was
her
uncle
's
;
she
*NL*
knew
it
as
well
as
his
voice
;
she
had
trembled
at
it
as
often
,
and
began
*NL*
to
tremble
again
,
at
the
idea
of
his
coming
up
to
speak
to
her
,
whatever
*NL*
might
be
the
subject
.
It
was
indeed
Sir
Thomas
who
opened
the
door
and
*NL*
asked
if
she
were
there
,
and
if
he
might
come
in
.
The
terror
of
his
*NL*
former
occasional
visits
to
that
room
seemed
all
renewed
,
and
she
felt
*NL*
as
if
he
were
going
to
examine
her
again
in
French
and
English
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
all
attention
,
however
,
in
placing
a
chair
for
him
,
and
trying
*NL*
to
appear
honoured
;
and
,
in
her
agitation
,
had
quite
overlooked
the
*NL*
deficiencies
of
her
apartment
,
till
he
,
stopping
short
as
he
entered
,
*NL*
said
,
with
much
surprise
,
``
Why
have
you
no
fire
to-day
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
snow
on
the
ground
,
and
she
was
sitting
in
a
shawl
.
She
*NL*
hesitated
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
not
cold
,
sir
:
I
never
sit
here
long
at
this
time
of
year
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
you
have
a
fire
in
general
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
comes
this
about
?
Here
must
be
some
mistake
.
I
understood
that
you
*NL*
had
the
use
of
this
room
by
way
of
making
you
perfectly
comfortable
.
*NL*
In
your
bedchamber
I
know
you
_
can
not
_
have
a
fire
.
Here
is
some
great
*NL*
misapprehension
which
must
be
rectified
.
It
is
highly
unfit
for
you
to
*NL*
sit
,
be
it
only
half
an
hour
a
day
,
without
a
fire
.
You
are
not
strong
.
*NL*
You
are
chilly
.
Your
aunt
can
not
be
aware
of
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
would
rather
have
been
silent
;
but
being
obliged
to
speak
,
she
*NL*
could
not
forbear
,
in
justice
to
the
aunt
she
loved
best
,
from
saying
*NL*
something
in
which
the
words
``
my
aunt
Norris
''
were
distinguishable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
understand
,
''
cried
her
uncle
,
recollecting
himself
,
and
not
wanting
*NL*
to
hear
more
:
``
I
understand
.
Your
aunt
Norris
has
always
been
an
*NL*
advocate
,
and
very
judiciously
,
for
young
people
's
being
brought
up
*NL*
without
unnecessary
indulgences
;
but
there
should
be
moderation
in
*NL*
everything
.
She
is
also
very
hardy
herself
,
which
of
course
will
*NL*
influence
her
in
her
opinion
of
the
wants
of
others
.
And
on
another
*NL*
account
,
too
,
I
can
perfectly
comprehend
.
I
know
what
her
sentiments
*NL*
have
always
been
.
The
principle
was
good
in
itself
,
but
it
may
have
*NL*
been
,
and
I
believe
_
has
_
_
been
_
,
carried
too
far
in
your
case
.
I
*NL*
am
aware
that
there
has
been
sometimes
,
in
some
points
,
a
misplaced
*NL*
distinction
;
but
I
think
too
well
of
you
,
Fanny
,
to
suppose
you
will
*NL*
ever
harbour
resentment
on
that
account
.
You
have
an
understanding
*NL*
which
will
prevent
you
from
receiving
things
only
in
part
,
and
judging
*NL*
partially
by
the
event
.
You
will
take
in
the
whole
of
the
past
,
you
*NL*
will
consider
times
,
persons
,
and
probabilities
,
and
you
will
feel
that
*NL*
_
they
_
were
not
least
your
friends
who
were
educating
and
preparing
you
*NL*
for
that
mediocrity
of
condition
which
_
seemed
_
to
be
your
lot
.
Though
*NL*
their
caution
may
prove
eventually
unnecessary
,
it
was
kindly
meant
;
and
*NL*
of
this
you
may
be
assured
,
that
every
advantage
of
affluence
will
be
*NL*
doubled
by
the
little
privations
and
restrictions
that
may
have
been
*NL*
imposed
.
I
am
sure
you
will
not
disappoint
my
opinion
of
you
,
by
failing
*NL*
at
any
time
to
treat
your
aunt
Norris
with
the
respect
and
attention
*NL*
that
are
due
to
her
.
But
enough
of
this
.
Sit
down
,
my
dear
.
I
must
speak
*NL*
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
I
will
not
detain
you
long
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
obeyed
,
with
eyes
cast
down
and
colour
rising
.
After
a
moment
's
*NL*
pause
,
Sir
Thomas
,
trying
to
suppress
a
smile
,
went
on
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
not
aware
,
perhaps
,
that
I
have
had
a
visitor
this
morning
.
I
*NL*
had
not
been
long
in
my
own
room
,
after
breakfast
,
when
Mr.
Crawford
was
*NL*
shewn
in
.
His
errand
you
may
probably
conjecture
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
colour
grew
deeper
and
deeper
;
and
her
uncle
,
perceiving
that
*NL*
she
was
embarrassed
to
a
degree
that
made
either
speaking
or
looking
*NL*
up
quite
impossible
,
turned
away
his
own
eyes
,
and
without
any
farther
*NL*
pause
proceeded
in
his
account
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
visit
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
's
business
had
been
to
declare
himself
the
lover
of
Fanny
,
*NL*
make
decided
proposals
for
her
,
and
entreat
the
sanction
of
the
uncle
,
*NL*
who
seemed
to
stand
in
the
place
of
her
parents
;
and
he
had
done
it
all
*NL*
so
well
,
so
openly
,
so
liberally
,
so
properly
,
that
Sir
Thomas
,
feeling
,
*NL*
moreover
,
his
own
replies
,
and
his
own
remarks
to
have
been
very
much
*NL*
to
the
purpose
,
was
exceedingly
happy
to
give
the
particulars
of
their
*NL*
conversation
;
and
little
aware
of
what
was
passing
in
his
niece
's
mind
,
*NL*
conceived
that
by
such
details
he
must
be
gratifying
her
far
more
than
*NL*
himself
.
He
talked
,
therefore
,
for
several
minutes
without
Fanny
's
*NL*
daring
to
interrupt
him
.
She
had
hardly
even
attained
the
wish
to
do
it
.
*NL*
Her
mind
was
in
too
much
confusion
.
She
had
changed
her
position
;
and
,
*NL*
with
her
eyes
fixed
intently
on
one
of
the
windows
,
was
listening
to
her
*NL*
uncle
in
the
utmost
perturbation
and
dismay
.
For
a
moment
he
ceased
,
but
*NL*
she
had
barely
become
conscious
of
it
,
when
,
rising
from
his
chair
,
he
*NL*
said
,
``
And
now
,
Fanny
,
having
performed
one
part
of
my
commission
,
*NL*
and
shewn
you
everything
placed
on
a
basis
the
most
assured
and
*NL*
satisfactory
,
I
may
execute
the
remainder
by
prevailing
on
you
to
*NL*
accompany
me
downstairs
,
where
,
though
I
can
not
but
presume
on
having
*NL*
been
no
unacceptable
companion
myself
,
I
must
submit
to
your
finding
*NL*
one
still
better
worth
listening
to
.
Mr.
Crawford
,
as
you
have
perhaps
*NL*
foreseen
,
is
yet
in
the
house
.
He
is
in
my
room
,
and
hoping
to
see
you
*NL*
there
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
look
,
a
start
,
an
exclamation
on
hearing
this
,
which
*NL*
astonished
Sir
Thomas
;
but
what
was
his
increase
of
astonishment
on
*NL*
hearing
her
exclaim
--
``
Oh
!
no
,
sir
,
I
can
not
,
indeed
I
can
not
go
down
to
*NL*
him
.
Mr.
Crawford
ought
to
know
--
he
must
know
that
:
I
told
him
enough
*NL*
yesterday
to
convince
him
;
he
spoke
to
me
on
this
subject
yesterday
,
*NL*
and
I
told
him
without
disguise
that
it
was
very
disagreeable
to
me
,
and
*NL*
quite
out
of
my
power
to
return
his
good
opinion
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
catch
your
meaning
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
sitting
down
again
.
``
Out
*NL*
of
your
power
to
return
his
good
opinion
?
What
is
all
this
?
I
know
he
*NL*
spoke
to
you
yesterday
,
and
-LRB-
as
far
as
I
understand
-RRB-
received
as
much
*NL*
encouragement
to
proceed
as
a
well-judging
young
woman
could
permit
*NL*
herself
to
give
.
I
was
very
much
pleased
with
what
I
collected
to
have
*NL*
been
your
behaviour
on
the
occasion
;
it
shewed
a
discretion
highly
to
*NL*
be
commended
.
But
now
,
when
he
has
made
his
overtures
so
properly
,
and
*NL*
honourably
--
what
are
your
scruples
_
now
_
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
sir
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
forced
by
the
anxiety
of
the
*NL*
moment
even
to
tell
her
uncle
that
he
was
wrong
;
``
you
are
quite
*NL*
mistaken
.
How
could
Mr.
Crawford
say
such
a
thing
?
I
gave
him
no
*NL*
encouragement
yesterday
.
On
the
contrary
,
I
told
him
,
I
can
not
recollect
*NL*
my
exact
words
,
but
I
am
sure
I
told
him
that
I
would
not
listen
to
him
,
*NL*
that
it
was
very
unpleasant
to
me
in
every
respect
,
and
that
I
begged
*NL*
him
never
to
talk
to
me
in
that
manner
again
.
I
am
sure
I
said
as
much
*NL*
as
that
and
more
;
and
I
should
have
said
still
more
,
if
I
had
been
quite
*NL*
certain
of
his
meaning
anything
seriously
;
but
I
did
not
like
to
be
,
I
*NL*
could
not
bear
to
be
,
imputing
more
than
might
be
intended
.
I
thought
it
*NL*
might
all
pass
for
nothing
with
_
him
_
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
say
no
more
;
her
breath
was
almost
gone
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Am
I
to
understand
,
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
few
moments
'
silence
,
*NL*
``
that
you
mean
to
_
refuse
_
Mr.
Crawford

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

*NL*
*NL*
``

him

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Refuse
Mr.
Crawford
!
Upon
what
plea
?
For
what
reason
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
--
I
can
not
like
him
,
sir
,
well
enough
to
marry
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
is
very
strange
!
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
in
a
voice
of
calm
displeasure
.
*NL*
``
There
is
something
in
this
which
my
comprehension
does
not
reach
.
Here
*NL*
is
a
young
man
wishing
to
pay
his
addresses
to
you
,
with
everything
to
*NL*
recommend
him
:
not
merely
situation
in
life
,
fortune
,
and
character
,
*NL*
but
with
more
than
common
agreeableness
,
with
address
and
conversation
*NL*
pleasing
to
everybody
.
And
he
is
not
an
acquaintance
of
to-day
;
you
have
*NL*
now
known
him
some
time
.
His
sister
,
moreover
,
is
your
intimate
friend
,
*NL*
and
he
has
been
doing
_
that
_
for
your
brother
,
which
I
should
suppose
*NL*
would
have
been
almost
sufficient
recommendation
to
you
,
had
there
been
*NL*
no
other
.
It
is
very
uncertain
when
my
interest
might
have
got
William
*NL*
on
.
He
has
done
it
already
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
''
said
Fanny
,
in
a
faint
voice
,
and
looking
down
with
fresh
shame
;
*NL*
and
she
did
feel
almost
ashamed
of
herself
,
after
such
a
picture
as
her
*NL*
uncle
had
drawn
,
for
not
liking
Mr.
Crawford
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
must
have
been
aware
,
''
continued
Sir
Thomas
presently
,
``
you
must
*NL*
have
been
some
time
aware
of
a
particularity
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
manners
*NL*
to
you
.
This
can
not
have
taken
you
by
surprise
.
You
must
have
observed
*NL*
his
attentions
;
and
though
you
always
received
them
very
properly
-LRB-
I
*NL*
have
no
accusation
to
make
on
that
head
-RRB-
,
I
never
perceived
them
to
be
*NL*
unpleasant
to
you
.
I
am
half
inclined
to
think
,
Fanny
,
that
you
do
not
*NL*
quite
know
your
own
feelings
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
yes
,
sir
!
indeed
I
do
.
His
attentions
were
always
--
what
I
did
not
*NL*
like
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
looked
at
her
with
deeper
surprise
.
``
This
is
beyond
me
,
''
*NL*
said
he
.
``
This
requires
explanation
.
Young
as
you
are
,
and
having
seen
*NL*
scarcely
any
one
,
it
is
hardly
possible
that
your
affections
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
paused
and
eyed
her
fixedly
.
He
saw
her
lips
formed
into
a
_
no
_
,
*NL*
though
the
sound
was
inarticulate
,
but
her
face
was
like
scarlet
.
That
,
*NL*
however
,
in
so
modest
a
girl
,
might
be
very
compatible
with
innocence
;
*NL*
and
chusing
at
least
to
appear
satisfied
,
he
quickly
added
,
``
No
,
no
,
I
*NL*
know
_
that
_
is
quite
out
of
the
question
;
quite
impossible
.
Well
,
there
*NL*
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
for
a
few
minutes
he
did
say
nothing
.
He
was
deep
in
thought
.
His
*NL*
niece
was
deep
in
thought
likewise
,
trying
to
harden
and
prepare
herself
*NL*
against
farther
questioning
.
She
would
rather
die
than
own
the
truth
;
*NL*
and
she
hoped
,
by
a
little
reflection
,
to
fortify
herself
beyond
*NL*
betraying
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Independently
of
the
interest
which
Mr.
Crawford
's
_
choice
_
seemed
to
*NL*
justify
''
said
Sir
Thomas
,
beginning
again
,
and
very
composedly
,
``
his
*NL*
wishing
to
marry
at
all
so
early
is
recommendatory
to
me
.
I
am
an
*NL*
advocate
for
early
marriages
,
where
there
are
means
in
proportion
,
and
*NL*
would
have
every
young
man
,
with
a
sufficient
income
,
settle
as
soon
*NL*
after
four-and-twenty
as
he
can
.
This
is
so
much
my
opinion
,
that
I
am
*NL*
sorry
to
think
how
little
likely
my
own
eldest
son
,
your
cousin
,
Mr.
*NL*
Bertram
,
is
to
marry
early
;
but
at
present
,
as
far
as
I
can
judge
,
*NL*
matrimony
makes
no
part
of
his
plans
or
thoughts
.
I
wish
he
were
more
*NL*
likely
to
fix
.
''
Here
was
a
glance
at
Fanny
.
``
Edmund
,
I
consider
,
from
*NL*
his
dispositions
and
habits
,
as
much
more
likely
to
marry
early
than
*NL*
his
brother
.
_
He
_
,
indeed
,
I
have
lately
thought
,
has
seen
the
woman
he
*NL*
could
love
,
which
,
I
am
convinced
,
my
eldest
son
has
not
.
Am
I
right
?
Do
*NL*
you
agree
with
me
,
my
dear
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
gently
,
but
it
was
calmly
said
,
and
Sir
Thomas
was
easy
on
the
*NL*
score
of
the
cousins
.
But
the
removal
of
his
alarm
did
his
niece
*NL*
no
service
:
as
her
unaccountableness
was
confirmed
his
displeasure
*NL*
increased
;
and
getting
up
and
walking
about
the
room
with
a
frown
,
which
*NL*
Fanny
could
picture
to
herself
,
though
she
dared
not
lift
up
her
eyes
,
*NL*
he
shortly
afterwards
,
and
in
a
voice
of
authority
,
said
,
``
Have
you
any
*NL*
reason
,
child
,
to
think
ill
of
Mr.
Crawford
's
temper
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
longed
to
add
,
``
But
of
his
principles
I
have
''
;
but
her
heart
sunk
*NL*
under
the
appalling
prospect
of
discussion
,
explanation
,
and
probably
*NL*
non-conviction
.
Her
ill
opinion
of
him
was
founded
chiefly
on
*NL*
observations
,
which
,
for
her
cousins
'
sake
,
she
could
scarcely
dare
*NL*
mention
to
their
father
.
Maria
and
Julia
,
and
especially
Maria
,
were
so
*NL*
closely
implicated
in
Mr.
Crawford
's
misconduct
,
that
she
could
not
give
*NL*
his
character
,
such
as
she
believed
it
,
without
betraying
them
.
She
had
*NL*
hoped
that
,
to
a
man
like
her
uncle
,
so
discerning
,
so
honourable
,
so
*NL*
good
,
the
simple
acknowledgment
of
settled
_
dislike
_
on
her
side
would
*NL*
have
been
sufficient
.
To
her
infinite
grief
she
found
it
was
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
came
towards
the
table
where
she
sat
in
trembling
*NL*
wretchedness
,
and
with
a
good
deal
of
cold
sternness
,
said
,
``
It
is
of
no
*NL*
use
,
I
perceive
,
to
talk
to
you
.
We
had
better
put
an
end
to
this
most
*NL*
mortifying
conference
.
Mr.
Crawford
must
not
be
kept
longer
waiting
.
I
*NL*
will
,
therefore
,
only
add
,
as
thinking
it
my
duty
to
mark
my
opinion
of
*NL*
your
conduct
,
that
you
have
disappointed
every
expectation
I
had
formed
,
*NL*
and
proved
yourself
of
a
character
the
very
reverse
of
what
I
had
*NL*
supposed
.
For
I
_
had
_
,
Fanny
,
as
I
think
my
behaviour
must
have
shewn
,
*NL*
formed
a
very
favourable
opinion
of
you
from
the
period
of
my
return
to
*NL*
England
.
I
had
thought
you
peculiarly
free
from
wilfulness
of
temper
,
*NL*
self-conceit
,
and
every
tendency
to
that
independence
of
spirit
which
*NL*
prevails
so
much
in
modern
days
,
even
in
young
women
,
and
which
in
young
*NL*
women
is
offensive
and
disgusting
beyond
all
common
offence
.
But
you
*NL*
have
now
shewn
me
that
you
can
be
wilful
and
perverse
;
that
you
can
and
*NL*
will
decide
for
yourself
,
without
any
consideration
or
deference
for
*NL*
those
who
have
surely
some
right
to
guide
you
,
without
even
asking
their
*NL*
advice
.
You
have
shewn
yourself
very
,
very
different
from
anything
that
*NL*
I
had
imagined
.
The
advantage
or
disadvantage
of
your
family
,
of
your
*NL*
parents
,
your
brothers
and
sisters
,
never
seems
to
have
had
a
moment
's
*NL*
share
in
your
thoughts
on
this
occasion
.
How
_
they
_
might
be
benefited
,
*NL*
how
_
they
_
must
rejoice
in
such
an
establishment
for
you
,
is
nothing
to
*NL*
_
you
_
.
You
think
only
of
yourself
,
and
because
you
do
not
feel
for
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
exactly
what
a
young
heated
fancy
imagines
to
be
necessary
for
*NL*
happiness
,
you
resolve
to
refuse
him
at
once
,
without
wishing
even
for
*NL*
a
little
time
to
consider
of
it
,
a
little
more
time
for
cool
*NL*
consideration
,
and
for
really
examining
your
own
inclinations
;
and
are
,
*NL*
in
a
wild
fit
of
folly
,
throwing
away
from
you
such
an
opportunity
of
*NL*
being
settled
in
life
,
eligibly
,
honourably
,
nobly
settled
,
as
will
,
*NL*
probably
,
never
occur
to
you
again
.
Here
is
a
young
man
of
sense
,
of
*NL*
character
,
of
temper
,
of
manners
,
and
of
fortune
,
exceedingly
attached
*NL*
to
you
,
and
seeking
your
hand
in
the
most
handsome
and
disinterested
*NL*
way
;
and
let
me
tell
you
,
Fanny
,
that
you
may
live
eighteen
years
longer
*NL*
in
the
world
without
being
addressed
by
a
man
of
half
Mr.
Crawford
's
*NL*
estate
,
or
a
tenth
part
of
his
merits
.
Gladly
would
I
have
bestowed
*NL*
either
of
my
own
daughters
on
him
.
Maria
is
nobly
married
;
but
had
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
sought
Julia
's
hand
,
I
should
have
given
it
to
him
with
*NL*
superior
and
more
heartfelt
satisfaction
than
I
gave
Maria
's
to
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
.
''
After
half
a
moment
's
pause
:
``
And
I
should
have
been
very
*NL*
much
surprised
had
either
of
my
daughters
,
on
receiving
a
proposal
*NL*
of
marriage
at
any
time
which
might
carry
with
it
only
_
half
_
the
*NL*
eligibility
of
_
this
_
,
immediately
and
peremptorily
,
and
without
paying
*NL*
my
opinion
or
my
regard
the
compliment
of
any
consultation
,
put
a
*NL*
decided
negative
on
it
.
I
should
have
been
much
surprised
and
much
hurt
*NL*
by
such
a
proceeding
.
I
should
have
thought
it
a
gross
violation
of
duty
*NL*
and
respect
.
_
You
_
are
not
to
be
judged
by
the
same
rule
.
You
do
not
*NL*
owe
me
the
duty
of
a
child
.
But
,
Fanny
,
if
your
heart
can
acquit
you
of
*NL*
_
ingratitude

''
*NL*
*NL*
He
ceased
.
Fanny
was
by
this
time
crying
so
bitterly
that
,
angry
as
he
*NL*
was
,
he
would
not
press
that
article
farther
.
Her
heart
was
almost
broke
*NL*
by
such
a
picture
of
what
she
appeared
to
him
;
by
such
accusations
,
*NL*
so
heavy
,
so
multiplied
,
so
rising
in
dreadful
gradation
!
Self-willed
,
*NL*
obstinate
,
selfish
,
and
ungrateful
.
He
thought
her
all
this
.
She
had
*NL*
deceived
his
expectations
;
she
had
lost
his
good
opinion
.
What
was
to
*NL*
become
of
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
very
sorry
,
''
said
she
inarticulately
,
through
her
tears
,
``
I
am
*NL*
very
sorry
indeed
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sorry
!
yes
,
I
hope
you
are
sorry
;
and
you
will
probably
have
reason
to
*NL*
be
long
sorry
for
this
day
's
transactions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
it
were
possible
for
me
to
do
otherwise
''
said
she
,
with
another
*NL*
strong
effort
;
``
but
I
am
so
perfectly
convinced
that
I
could
never
make
*NL*
him
happy
,
and
that
I
should
be
miserable
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
burst
of
tears
;
but
in
spite
of
that
burst
,
and
in
spite
of
that
*NL*
great
black
word
_
miserable
_
,
which
served
to
introduce
it
,
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
began
to
think
a
little
relenting
,
a
little
change
of
inclination
,
might
*NL*
have
something
to
do
with
it
;
and
to
augur
favourably
from
the
personal
*NL*
entreaty
of
the
young
man
himself
.
He
knew
her
to
be
very
timid
,
and
*NL*
exceedingly
nervous
;
and
thought
it
not
improbable
that
her
mind
*NL*
might
be
in
such
a
state
as
a
little
time
,
a
little
pressing
,
a
little
*NL*
patience
,
and
a
little
impatience
,
a
judicious
mixture
of
all
on
the
*NL*
lover
's
side
,
might
work
their
usual
effect
on
.
If
the
gentleman
would
*NL*
but
persevere
,
if
he
had
but
love
enough
to
persevere
,
Sir
Thomas
began
*NL*
to
have
hopes
;
and
these
reflections
having
passed
across
his
mind
and
*NL*
cheered
it
,
``
Well
,
''
said
he
,
in
a
tone
of
becoming
gravity
,
but
of
less
*NL*
anger
,
``
well
,
child
,
dry
up
your
tears
.
There
is
no
use
in
these
tears
;
*NL*
they
can
do
no
good
.
You
must
now
come
downstairs
with
me
.
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
has
been
kept
waiting
too
long
already
.
You
must
give
him
your
own
*NL*
answer
:
we
can
not
expect
him
to
be
satisfied
with
less
;
and
you
only
*NL*
can
explain
to
him
the
grounds
of
that
misconception
of
your
sentiments
,
*NL*
which
,
unfortunately
for
himself
,
he
certainly
has
imbibed
.
I
am
totally
*NL*
unequal
to
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Fanny
shewed
such
reluctance
,
such
misery
,
at
the
idea
of
going
down
*NL*
to
him
,
that
Sir
Thomas
,
after
a
little
consideration
,
judged
it
better
*NL*
to
indulge
her
.
His
hopes
from
both
gentleman
and
lady
suffered
a
small
*NL*
depression
in
consequence
;
but
when
he
looked
at
his
niece
,
and
saw
the
*NL*
state
of
feature
and
complexion
which
her
crying
had
brought
her
*NL*
into
,
he
thought
there
might
be
as
much
lost
as
gained
by
an
immediate
*NL*
interview
.
With
a
few
words
,
therefore
,
of
no
particular
meaning
,
he
*NL*
walked
off
by
himself
,
leaving
his
poor
niece
to
sit
and
cry
over
what
*NL*
had
passed
,
with
very
wretched
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
mind
was
all
disorder
.
The
past
,
present
,
future
,
everything
was
*NL*
terrible
.
But
her
uncle
's
anger
gave
her
the
severest
pain
of
all
.
*NL*
Selfish
and
ungrateful
!
to
have
appeared
so
to
him
!
She
was
miserable
*NL*
for
ever
.
She
had
no
one
to
take
her
part
,
to
counsel
,
or
speak
for
her
.
*NL*
Her
only
friend
was
absent
.
He
might
have
softened
his
father
;
but
all
,
*NL*
perhaps
all
,
would
think
her
selfish
and
ungrateful
.
She
might
have
to
*NL*
endure
the
reproach
again
and
again
;
she
might
hear
it
,
or
see
it
,
or
*NL*
know
it
to
exist
for
ever
in
every
connexion
about
her
.
She
could
not
*NL*
but
feel
some
resentment
against
Mr.
Crawford
;
yet
,
if
he
really
loved
*NL*
her
,
and
were
unhappy
too
!
It
was
all
wretchedness
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
her
uncle
returned
;
she
was
almost
*NL*
ready
to
faint
at
the
sight
of
him
.
He
spoke
calmly
,
however
,
without
*NL*
austerity
,
without
reproach
,
and
she
revived
a
little
.
There
was
*NL*
comfort
,
too
,
in
his
words
,
as
well
as
his
manner
,
for
he
began
with
,
*NL*
``
Mr.
Crawford
is
gone
:
he
has
just
left
me
.
I
need
not
repeat
what
has
*NL*
passed
.
I
do
not
want
to
add
to
anything
you
may
now
be
feeling
,
by
an
*NL*
account
of
what
he
has
felt
.
Suffice
it
,
that
he
has
behaved
in
the
*NL*
most
gentlemanlike
and
generous
manner
,
and
has
confirmed
me
in
a
most
*NL*
favourable
opinion
of
his
understanding
,
heart
,
and
temper
.
Upon
my
*NL*
representation
of
what
you
were
suffering
,
he
immediately
,
and
with
the
*NL*
greatest
delicacy
,
ceased
to
urge
to
see
you
for
the
present
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Here
Fanny
,
who
had
looked
up
,
looked
down
again
.
``
Of
course
,
''
continued
*NL*
her
uncle
,
``
it
can
not
be
supposed
but
that
he
should
request
to
speak
*NL*
with
you
alone
,
be
it
only
for
five
minutes
;
a
request
too
natural
,
*NL*
a
claim
too
just
to
be
denied
.
But
there
is
no
time
fixed
;
perhaps
*NL*
to-morrow
,
or
whenever
your
spirits
are
composed
enough
.
For
the
present
*NL*
you
have
only
to
tranquillise
yourself
.
Check
these
tears
;
they
do
but
*NL*
exhaust
you
.
If
,
as
I
am
willing
to
suppose
,
you
wish
to
shew
me
any
*NL*
observance
,
you
will
not
give
way
to
these
emotions
,
but
endeavour
to
*NL*
reason
yourself
into
a
stronger
frame
of
mind
.
I
advise
you
to
go
out
:
*NL*
the
air
will
do
you
good
;
go
out
for
an
hour
on
the
gravel
;
you
will
*NL*
have
the
shrubbery
to
yourself
,
and
will
be
the
better
for
air
and
*NL*
exercise
.
And
,
Fanny
''
-LRB-
turning
back
again
for
a
moment
-RRB-
,
``
I
shall
make
*NL*
no
mention
below
of
what
has
passed
;
I
shall
not
even
tell
your
aunt
*NL*
Bertram
.
There
is
no
occasion
for
spreading
the
disappointment
;
say
*NL*
nothing
about
it
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
an
order
to
be
most
joyfully
obeyed
;
this
was
an
act
of
*NL*
kindness
which
Fanny
felt
at
her
heart
.
To
be
spared
from
her
aunt
*NL*
Norris
's
interminable
reproaches
!
he
left
her
in
a
glow
of
gratitude
.
*NL*
Anything
might
be
bearable
rather
than
such
reproaches
.
Even
to
see
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
would
be
less
overpowering
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
walked
out
directly
,
as
her
uncle
recommended
,
and
followed
his
*NL*
advice
throughout
,
as
far
as
she
could
;
did
check
her
tears
;
did
*NL*
earnestly
try
to
compose
her
spirits
and
strengthen
her
mind
.
She
wished
*NL*
to
prove
to
him
that
she
did
desire
his
comfort
,
and
sought
to
regain
*NL*
his
favour
;
and
he
had
given
her
another
strong
motive
for
exertion
,
in
*NL*
keeping
the
whole
affair
from
the
knowledge
of
her
aunts
.
Not
to
excite
*NL*
suspicion
by
her
look
or
manner
was
now
an
object
worth
attaining
;
and
*NL*
she
felt
equal
to
almost
anything
that
might
save
her
from
her
aunt
*NL*
Norris
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
struck
,
quite
struck
,
when
,
on
returning
from
her
walk
and
going
*NL*
into
the
East
room
again
,
the
first
thing
which
caught
her
eye
was
a
*NL*
fire
lighted
and
burning
.
A
fire
!
it
seemed
too
much
;
just
at
that
time
*NL*
to
be
giving
her
such
an
indulgence
was
exciting
even
painful
gratitude
.
*NL*
She
wondered
that
Sir
Thomas
could
have
leisure
to
think
of
such
a
*NL*
trifle
again
;
but
she
soon
found
,
from
the
voluntary
information
of
the
*NL*
housemaid
,
who
came
in
to
attend
it
,
that
so
it
was
to
be
every
day
.
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
had
given
orders
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
must
be
a
brute
,
indeed
,
if
I
can
be
really
ungrateful
!
''
said
she
,
in
*NL*
soliloquy
.
``
Heaven
defend
me
from
being
ungrateful
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
saw
nothing
more
of
her
uncle
,
nor
of
her
aunt
Norris
,
till
they
met
*NL*
at
dinner
.
Her
uncle
's
behaviour
to
her
was
then
as
nearly
as
possible
*NL*
what
it
had
been
before
;
she
was
sure
he
did
not
mean
there
should
be
*NL*
any
change
,
and
that
it
was
only
her
own
conscience
that
could
fancy
*NL*
any
;
but
her
aunt
was
soon
quarrelling
with
her
;
and
when
she
found
how
*NL*
much
and
how
unpleasantly
her
having
only
walked
out
without
her
aunt
's
*NL*
knowledge
could
be
dwelt
on
,
she
felt
all
the
reason
she
had
to
bless
*NL*
the
kindness
which
saved
her
from
the
same
spirit
of
reproach
,
exerted
*NL*
on
a
more
momentous
subject
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
If
I
had
known
you
were
going
out
,
I
should
have
got
you
just
to
go
*NL*
as
far
as
my
house
with
some
orders
for
Nanny
,
''
said
she
,
``
which
I
have
*NL*
since
,
to
my
very
great
inconvenience
,
been
obliged
to
go
and
carry
*NL*
myself
.
I
could
very
ill
spare
the
time
,
and
you
might
have
saved
me
the
*NL*
trouble
,
if
you
would
only
have
been
so
good
as
to
let
us
know
you
were
*NL*
going
out
.
It
would
have
made
no
difference
to
you
,
I
suppose
,
whether
*NL*
you
had
walked
in
the
shrubbery
or
gone
to
my
house
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
recommended
the
shrubbery
to
Fanny
as
the
driest
place
,
''
said
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
''
said
Mrs.
Norris
,
with
a
moment
's
check
,
``
that
was
very
kind
of
*NL*
you
,
Sir
Thomas
;
but
you
do
not
know
how
dry
the
path
is
to
my
house
.
*NL*
Fanny
would
have
had
quite
as
good
a
walk
there
,
I
assure
you
,
with
the
*NL*
advantage
of
being
of
some
use
,
and
obliging
her
aunt
:
it
is
all
her
*NL*
fault
.
If
she
would
but
have
let
us
know
she
was
going
out
but
there
is
*NL*
a
something
about
Fanny
,
I
have
often
observed
it
before
--
she
likes
to
*NL*
go
her
own
way
to
work
;
she
does
not
like
to
be
dictated
to
;
she
takes
*NL*
her
own
independent
walk
whenever
she
can
;
she
certainly
has
a
little
*NL*
spirit
of
secrecy
,
and
independence
,
and
nonsense
,
about
her
,
which
I
*NL*
would
advise
her
to
get
the
better
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
As
a
general
reflection
on
Fanny
,
Sir
Thomas
thought
nothing
could
be
*NL*
more
unjust
,
though
he
had
been
so
lately
expressing
the
same
sentiments
*NL*
himself
,
and
he
tried
to
turn
the
conversation
:
tried
repeatedly
*NL*
before
he
could
succeed
;
for
Mrs.
Norris
had
not
discernment
enough
to
*NL*
perceive
,
either
now
,
or
at
any
other
time
,
to
what
degree
he
thought
*NL*
well
of
his
niece
,
or
how
very
far
he
was
from
wishing
to
have
his
own
*NL*
children
's
merits
set
off
by
the
depreciation
of
hers
.
She
was
talking
*NL*
_
at
_
Fanny
,
and
resenting
this
private
walk
half
through
the
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
over
,
however
,
at
last
;
and
the
evening
set
in
with
more
*NL*
composure
to
Fanny
,
and
more
cheerfulness
of
spirits
than
she
could
*NL*
have
hoped
for
after
so
stormy
a
morning
;
but
she
trusted
,
in
the
first
*NL*
place
,
that
she
had
done
right
:
that
her
judgment
had
not
misled
her
.
*NL*
For
the
purity
of
her
intentions
she
could
answer
;
and
she
was
willing
*NL*
to
hope
,
secondly
,
that
her
uncle
's
displeasure
was
abating
,
and
would
*NL*
abate
farther
as
he
considered
the
matter
with
more
impartiality
,
and
*NL*
felt
,
as
a
good
man
must
feel
,
how
wretched
,
and
how
unpardonable
,
how
*NL*
hopeless
,
and
how
wicked
it
was
to
marry
without
affection
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
the
meeting
with
which
she
was
threatened
for
the
morrow
was
past
,
*NL*
she
could
not
but
flatter
herself
that
the
subject
would
be
finally
*NL*
concluded
,
and
Mr.
Crawford
once
gone
from
Mansfield
,
that
everything
*NL*
would
soon
be
as
if
no
such
subject
had
existed
.
She
would
not
,
could
*NL*
not
believe
,
that
Mr.
Crawford
's
affection
for
her
could
distress
him
*NL*
long
;
his
mind
was
not
of
that
sort
.
London
would
soon
bring
its
cure
.
*NL*
In
London
he
would
soon
learn
to
wonder
at
his
infatuation
,
and
be
*NL*
thankful
for
the
right
reason
in
her
which
had
saved
him
from
its
evil
*NL*
consequences
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
Fanny
's
mind
was
engaged
in
these
sort
of
hopes
,
her
uncle
was
,
*NL*
soon
after
tea
,
called
out
of
the
room
;
an
occurrence
too
common
to
*NL*
strike
her
,
and
she
thought
nothing
of
it
till
the
butler
reappeared
ten
*NL*
minutes
afterwards
,
and
advancing
decidedly
towards
herself
,
said
,
*NL*
``
Sir
Thomas
wishes
to
speak
with
you
,
ma'am
,
in
his
own
room
.
''
Then
it
*NL*
occurred
to
her
what
might
be
going
on
;
a
suspicion
rushed
over
her
mind
*NL*
which
drove
the
colour
from
her
cheeks
;
but
instantly
rising
,
she
was
*NL*
preparing
to
obey
,
when
Mrs.
Norris
called
out
,
``
Stay
,
stay
,
Fanny
!
what
*NL*
are
you
about
?
where
are
you
going
?
do
n't
be
in
such
a
hurry
.
Depend
*NL*
upon
it
,
it
is
not
you
who
are
wanted
;
depend
upon
it
,
it
is
me
''
*NL*
-LRB-
looking
at
the
butler
-RRB-
;
``
but
you
are
so
very
eager
to
put
yourself
*NL*
forward
.
What
should
Sir
Thomas
want
you
for
?
It
is
me
,
Baddeley
,
you
*NL*
mean
;
I
am
coming
this
moment
.
You
mean
me
,
Baddeley
,
I
am
sure
;
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
wants
me
,
not
Miss
Price
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
But
Baddeley
was
stout
.
``
No
,
ma'am
,
it
is
Miss
Price
;
I
am
certain
of
*NL*
its
being
Miss
Price
.
''
And
there
was
a
half-smile
with
the
words
,
which
*NL*
meant
,
``
I
do
not
think
you
would
answer
the
purpose
at
all
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
much
discontented
,
was
obliged
to
compose
herself
to
work
*NL*
again
;
and
Fanny
,
walking
off
in
agitating
consciousness
,
found
herself
,
*NL*
as
she
anticipated
,
in
another
minute
alone
with
Mr.
Crawford
.

CHAPTER
XXXIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
conference
was
neither
so
short
nor
so
conclusive
as
the
lady
had
*NL*
designed
.
The
gentleman
was
not
so
easily
satisfied
.
He
had
all
the
*NL*
disposition
to
persevere
that
Sir
Thomas
could
wish
him
.
He
had
vanity
,
*NL*
which
strongly
inclined
him
in
the
first
place
to
think
she
did
love
*NL*
him
,
though
she
might
not
know
it
herself
;
and
which
,
secondly
,
when
*NL*
constrained
at
last
to
admit
that
she
did
know
her
own
present
feelings
,
*NL*
convinced
him
that
he
should
be
able
in
time
to
make
those
feelings
what
*NL*
he
wished
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
in
love
,
very
much
in
love
;
and
it
was
a
love
which
,
operating
*NL*
on
an
active
,
sanguine
spirit
,
of
more
warmth
than
delicacy
,
made
her
*NL*
affection
appear
of
greater
consequence
because
it
was
withheld
,
and
*NL*
determined
him
to
have
the
glory
,
as
well
as
the
felicity
,
of
forcing
*NL*
her
to
love
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
would
not
despair
:
he
would
not
desist
.
He
had
every
well-grounded
*NL*
reason
for
solid
attachment
;
he
knew
her
to
have
all
the
worth
that
*NL*
could
justify
the
warmest
hopes
of
lasting
happiness
with
her
;
her
*NL*
conduct
at
this
very
time
,
by
speaking
the
disinterestedness
and
*NL*
delicacy
of
her
character
-LRB-
qualities
which
he
believed
most
rare
*NL*
indeed
-RRB-
,
was
of
a
sort
to
heighten
all
his
wishes
,
and
confirm
all
his
*NL*
resolutions
.
He
knew
not
that
he
had
a
pre-engaged
heart
to
attack
.
*NL*
Of
_
that
_
he
had
no
suspicion
.
He
considered
her
rather
as
one
who
*NL*
had
never
thought
on
the
subject
enough
to
be
in
danger
;
who
had
been
*NL*
guarded
by
youth
,
a
youth
of
mind
as
lovely
as
of
person
;
whose
modesty
*NL*
had
prevented
her
from
understanding
his
attentions
,
and
who
was
still
*NL*
overpowered
by
the
suddenness
of
addresses
so
wholly
unexpected
,
and
the
*NL*
novelty
of
a
situation
which
her
fancy
had
never
taken
into
account
.
*NL*
*NL*
Must
it
not
follow
of
course
,
that
,
when
he
was
understood
,
he
should
*NL*
succeed
?
He
believed
it
fully
.
Love
such
as
his
,
in
a
man
like
himself
,
*NL*
must
with
perseverance
secure
a
return
,
and
at
no
great
distance
;
and
*NL*
he
had
so
much
delight
in
the
idea
of
obliging
her
to
love
him
in
a
very
*NL*
short
time
,
that
her
not
loving
him
now
was
scarcely
regretted
.
A
little
*NL*
difficulty
to
be
overcome
was
no
evil
to
Henry
Crawford
.
He
rather
*NL*
derived
spirits
from
it
.
He
had
been
apt
to
gain
hearts
too
easily
.
His
*NL*
situation
was
new
and
animating
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
Fanny
,
however
,
who
had
known
too
much
opposition
all
her
life
to
*NL*
find
any
charm
in
it
,
all
this
was
unintelligible
.
She
found
that
he
did
*NL*
mean
to
persevere
;
but
how
he
could
,
after
such
language
from
her
as
she
*NL*
felt
herself
obliged
to
use
,
was
not
to
be
understood
.
She
told
him
that
*NL*
she
did
not
love
him
,
could
not
love
him
,
was
sure
she
never
should
love
*NL*
him
;
that
such
a
change
was
quite
impossible
;
that
the
subject
was
most
*NL*
painful
to
her
;
that
she
must
entreat
him
never
to
mention
it
again
,
to
*NL*
allow
her
to
leave
him
at
once
,
and
let
it
be
considered
as
concluded
*NL*
for
ever
.
And
when
farther
pressed
,
had
added
,
that
in
her
opinion
their
*NL*
dispositions
were
so
totally
dissimilar
as
to
make
mutual
affection
*NL*
incompatible
;
and
that
they
were
unfitted
for
each
other
by
nature
,
*NL*
education
,
and
habit
.
All
this
she
had
said
,
and
with
the
earnestness
*NL*
of
sincerity
;
yet
this
was
not
enough
,
for
he
immediately
denied
there
*NL*
being
anything
uncongenial
in
their
characters
,
or
anything
unfriendly
*NL*
in
their
situations
;
and
positively
declared
,
that
he
would
still
love
,
*NL*
and
still
hope
!
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
knew
her
own
meaning
,
but
was
no
judge
of
her
own
manner
.
Her
*NL*
manner
was
incurably
gentle
;
and
she
was
not
aware
how
much
it
concealed
*NL*
the
sternness
of
her
purpose
.
Her
diffidence
,
gratitude
,
and
softness
*NL*
made
every
expression
of
indifference
seem
almost
an
effort
of
*NL*
self-denial
;
seem
,
at
least
,
to
be
giving
nearly
as
much
pain
to
herself
*NL*
as
to
him
.
Mr.
Crawford
was
no
longer
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
,
as
the
*NL*
clandestine
,
insidious
,
treacherous
admirer
of
Maria
Bertram
,
had
been
*NL*
her
abhorrence
,
whom
she
had
hated
to
see
or
to
speak
to
,
in
whom
she
*NL*
could
believe
no
good
quality
to
exist
,
and
whose
power
,
even
of
being
*NL*
agreeable
,
she
had
barely
acknowledged
.
He
was
now
the
Mr.
Crawford
who
*NL*
was
addressing
herself
with
ardent
,
disinterested
love
;
whose
feelings
*NL*
were
apparently
become
all
that
was
honourable
and
upright
,
whose
views
*NL*
of
happiness
were
all
fixed
on
a
marriage
of
attachment
;
who
was
*NL*
pouring
out
his
sense
of
her
merits
,
describing
and
describing
again
his
*NL*
affection
,
proving
as
far
as
words
could
prove
it
,
and
in
the
language
,
*NL*
tone
,
and
spirit
of
a
man
of
talent
too
,
that
he
sought
her
for
her
*NL*
gentleness
and
her
goodness
;
and
to
complete
the
whole
,
he
was
now
the
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
who
had
procured
William
's
promotion
!
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
a
change
,
and
here
were
claims
which
could
not
but
operate
!
*NL*
She
might
have
disdained
him
in
all
the
dignity
of
angry
virtue
,
in
*NL*
the
grounds
of
Sotherton
,
or
the
theatre
at
Mansfield
Park
;
but
he
*NL*
approached
her
now
with
rights
that
demanded
different
treatment
.
*NL*
She
must
be
courteous
,
and
she
must
be
compassionate
.
She
must
have
*NL*
a
sensation
of
being
honoured
,
and
whether
thinking
of
herself
or
her
*NL*
brother
,
she
must
have
a
strong
feeling
of
gratitude
.
The
effect
of
the
*NL*
whole
was
a
manner
so
pitying
and
agitated
,
and
words
intermingled
with
*NL*
her
refusal
so
expressive
of
obligation
and
concern
,
that
to
a
temper
of
*NL*
vanity
and
hope
like
Crawford
's
,
the
truth
,
or
at
least
the
strength
*NL*
of
her
indifference
,
might
well
be
questionable
;
and
he
was
not
so
*NL*
irrational
as
Fanny
considered
him
,
in
the
professions
of
persevering
,
*NL*
assiduous
,
and
not
desponding
attachment
which
closed
the
interview
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
with
reluctance
that
he
suffered
her
to
go
;
but
there
was
no
look
*NL*
of
despair
in
parting
to
belie
his
words
,
or
give
her
hopes
of
his
being
*NL*
less
unreasonable
than
he
professed
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Now
she
was
angry
.
Some
resentment
did
arise
at
a
perseverance
so
*NL*
selfish
and
ungenerous
.
Here
was
again
a
want
of
delicacy
and
regard
for
*NL*
others
which
had
formerly
so
struck
and
disgusted
her
.
Here
was
again
*NL*
a
something
of
the
same
Mr.
Crawford
whom
she
had
so
reprobated
before
.
*NL*
How
evidently
was
there
a
gross
want
of
feeling
and
humanity
where
his
*NL*
own
pleasure
was
concerned
;
and
alas
!
how
always
known
no
principle
to
*NL*
supply
as
a
duty
what
the
heart
was
deficient
in
!
Had
her
own
affections
*NL*
been
as
free
as
perhaps
they
ought
to
have
been
,
he
never
could
have
*NL*
engaged
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
So
thought
Fanny
,
in
good
truth
and
sober
sadness
,
as
she
sat
musing
*NL*
over
that
too
great
indulgence
and
luxury
of
a
fire
upstairs
:
wondering
*NL*
at
the
past
and
present
;
wondering
at
what
was
yet
to
come
,
and
in
a
*NL*
nervous
agitation
which
made
nothing
clear
to
her
but
the
persuasion
of
*NL*
her
being
never
under
any
circumstances
able
to
love
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
*NL*
the
felicity
of
having
a
fire
to
sit
over
and
think
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
obliged
,
or
obliged
himself
,
to
wait
till
the
morrow
for
*NL*
a
knowledge
of
what
had
passed
between
the
young
people
.
He
then
saw
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
received
his
account
.
The
first
feeling
was
*NL*
disappointment
:
he
had
hoped
better
things
;
he
had
thought
that
an
*NL*
hour
's
entreaty
from
a
young
man
like
Crawford
could
not
have
worked
so
*NL*
little
change
on
a
gentle-tempered
girl
like
Fanny
;
but
there
was
speedy
*NL*
comfort
in
the
determined
views
and
sanguine
perseverance
of
the
lover
;
*NL*
and
when
seeing
such
confidence
of
success
in
the
principal
,
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
was
soon
able
to
depend
on
it
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
was
omitted
,
on
his
side
,
of
civility
,
compliment
,
or
kindness
,
*NL*
that
might
assist
the
plan
.
Mr.
Crawford
's
steadiness
was
honoured
,
and
*NL*
Fanny
was
praised
,
and
the
connexion
was
still
the
most
desirable
in
the
*NL*
world
.
At
Mansfield
Park
Mr.
Crawford
would
always
be
welcome
;
he
had
*NL*
only
to
consult
his
own
judgment
and
feelings
as
to
the
frequency
of
his
*NL*
visits
,
at
present
or
in
future
.
In
all
his
niece
's
family
and
friends
,
*NL*
there
could
be
but
one
opinion
,
one
wish
on
the
subject
;
the
influence
*NL*
of
all
who
loved
her
must
incline
one
way
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everything
was
said
that
could
encourage
,
every
encouragement
received
*NL*
with
grateful
joy
,
and
the
gentlemen
parted
the
best
of
friends
.
*NL*
*NL*
Satisfied
that
the
cause
was
now
on
a
footing
the
most
proper
and
*NL*
hopeful
,
Sir
Thomas
resolved
to
abstain
from
all
farther
importunity
*NL*
with
his
niece
,
and
to
shew
no
open
interference
.
Upon
her
disposition
*NL*
he
believed
kindness
might
be
the
best
way
of
working
.
Entreaty
should
*NL*
be
from
one
quarter
only
.
The
forbearance
of
her
family
on
a
point
,
*NL*
respecting
which
she
could
be
in
no
doubt
of
their
wishes
,
might
be
*NL*
their
surest
means
of
forwarding
it
.
Accordingly
,
on
this
principle
,
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
took
the
first
opportunity
of
saying
to
her
,
with
a
mild
gravity
,
*NL*
intended
to
be
overcoming
,
``
Well
,
Fanny
,
I
have
seen
Mr.
Crawford
again
,
*NL*
and
learn
from
him
exactly
how
matters
stand
between
you
.
He
is
a
most
*NL*
extraordinary
young
man
,
and
whatever
be
the
event
,
you
must
feel
that
*NL*
you
have
created
an
attachment
of
no
common
character
;
though
,
young
*NL*
as
you
are
,
and
little
acquainted
with
the
transient
,
varying
,
unsteady
*NL*
nature
of
love
,
as
it
generally
exists
,
you
can
not
be
struck
as
I
*NL*
am
with
all
that
is
wonderful
in
a
perseverance
of
this
sort
against
*NL*
discouragement
.
With
him
it
is
entirely
a
matter
of
feeling
:
he
claims
*NL*
no
merit
in
it
;
perhaps
is
entitled
to
none
.
Yet
,
having
chosen
so
*NL*
well
,
his
constancy
has
a
respectable
stamp
.
Had
his
choice
been
less
*NL*
unexceptionable
,
I
should
have
condemned
his
persevering
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
sir
,
''
said
Fanny
,
``
I
am
very
sorry
that
Mr.
Crawford
should
*NL*
continue
to
know
that
it
is
paying
me
a
very
great
compliment
,
and
I
*NL*
feel
most
undeservedly
honoured
;
but
I
am
so
perfectly
convinced
,
and
I
*NL*
have
told
him
so
,
that
it
never
will
be
in
my
power
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
''
interrupted
Sir
Thomas
,
``
there
is
no
occasion
for
this
.
Your
*NL*
feelings
are
as
well
known
to
me
as
my
wishes
and
regrets
must
be
*NL*
to
you
.
There
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
or
done
.
From
this
hour
the
*NL*
subject
is
never
to
be
revived
between
us
.
You
will
have
nothing
to
*NL*
fear
,
or
to
be
agitated
about
.
You
can
not
suppose
me
capable
of
trying
*NL*
to
persuade
you
to
marry
against
your
inclinations
.
Your
happiness
and
*NL*
advantage
are
all
that
I
have
in
view
,
and
nothing
is
required
of
you
*NL*
but
to
bear
with
Mr.
Crawford
's
endeavours
to
convince
you
that
they
may
*NL*
not
be
incompatible
with
his
.
He
proceeds
at
his
own
risk
.
You
are
on
*NL*
safe
ground
.
I
have
engaged
for
your
seeing
him
whenever
he
calls
,
as
*NL*
you
might
have
done
had
nothing
of
this
sort
occurred
.
You
will
see
*NL*
him
with
the
rest
of
us
,
in
the
same
manner
,
and
,
as
much
as
you
*NL*
can
,
dismissing
the
recollection
of
everything
unpleasant
.
He
leaves
*NL*
Northamptonshire
so
soon
,
that
even
this
slight
sacrifice
can
not
be
*NL*
often
demanded
.
The
future
must
be
very
uncertain
.
And
now
,
my
dear
*NL*
Fanny
,
this
subject
is
closed
between
us
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
promised
departure
was
all
that
Fanny
could
think
of
with
much
*NL*
satisfaction
.
Her
uncle
's
kind
expressions
,
however
,
and
forbearing
*NL*
manner
,
were
sensibly
felt
;
and
when
she
considered
how
much
of
the
*NL*
truth
was
unknown
to
him
,
she
believed
she
had
no
right
to
wonder
at
*NL*
the
line
of
conduct
he
pursued
.
He
,
who
had
married
a
daughter
to
Mr.
*NL*
Rushworth
:
romantic
delicacy
was
certainly
not
to
be
expected
from
him
.
*NL*
She
must
do
her
duty
,
and
trust
that
time
might
make
her
duty
easier
*NL*
than
it
now
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
could
not
,
though
only
eighteen
,
suppose
Mr.
Crawford
's
attachment
*NL*
would
hold
out
for
ever
;
she
could
not
but
imagine
that
steady
,
*NL*
unceasing
discouragement
from
herself
would
put
an
end
to
it
in
time
.
*NL*
How
much
time
she
might
,
in
her
own
fancy
,
allot
for
its
dominion
,
is
*NL*
another
concern
.
It
would
not
be
fair
to
inquire
into
a
young
lady
's
*NL*
exact
estimate
of
her
own
perfections
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
his
intended
silence
,
Sir
Thomas
found
himself
once
more
*NL*
obliged
to
mention
the
subject
to
his
niece
,
to
prepare
her
briefly
for
*NL*
its
being
imparted
to
her
aunts
;
a
measure
which
he
would
still
have
*NL*
avoided
,
if
possible
,
but
which
became
necessary
from
the
totally
*NL*
opposite
feelings
of
Mr.
Crawford
as
to
any
secrecy
of
proceeding
.
He
*NL*
had
no
idea
of
concealment
.
It
was
all
known
at
the
Parsonage
,
where
*NL*
he
loved
to
talk
over
the
future
with
both
his
sisters
,
and
it
would
be
*NL*
rather
gratifying
to
him
to
have
enlightened
witnesses
of
the
progress
*NL*
of
his
success
.
When
Sir
Thomas
understood
this
,
he
felt
the
necessity
*NL*
of
making
his
own
wife
and
sister-in-law
acquainted
with
the
business
*NL*
without
delay
;
though
,
on
Fanny
's
account
,
he
almost
dreaded
the
*NL*
effect
of
the
communication
to
Mrs.
Norris
as
much
as
Fanny
herself
.
He
*NL*
deprecated
her
mistaken
but
well-meaning
zeal
.
Sir
Thomas
,
indeed
,
was
,
*NL*
by
this
time
,
not
very
far
from
classing
Mrs.
Norris
as
one
of
those
*NL*
well-meaning
people
who
are
always
doing
mistaken
and
very
disagreeable
*NL*
things
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
,
however
,
relieved
him
.
He
pressed
for
the
strictest
*NL*
forbearance
and
silence
towards
their
niece
;
she
not
only
promised
,
but
*NL*
did
observe
it
.
She
only
looked
her
increased
ill-will
.
Angry
she
was
:
*NL*
bitterly
angry
;
but
she
was
more
angry
with
Fanny
for
having
received
*NL*
such
an
offer
than
for
refusing
it
.
It
was
an
injury
and
affront
to
*NL*
Julia
,
who
ought
to
have
been
Mr.
Crawford
's
choice
;
and
,
independently
*NL*
of
that
,
she
disliked
Fanny
,
because
she
had
neglected
her
;
and
she
*NL*
would
have
grudged
such
an
elevation
to
one
whom
she
had
been
always
*NL*
trying
to
depress
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
gave
her
more
credit
for
discretion
on
the
occasion
than
she
*NL*
deserved
;
and
Fanny
could
have
blessed
her
for
allowing
her
only
to
see
*NL*
her
displeasure
,
and
not
to
hear
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
took
it
differently
.
She
had
been
a
beauty
,
and
a
*NL*
prosperous
beauty
,
all
her
life
;
and
beauty
and
wealth
were
all
that
*NL*
excited
her
respect
.
To
know
Fanny
to
be
sought
in
marriage
by
a
man
of
*NL*
fortune
,
raised
her
,
therefore
,
very
much
in
her
opinion
.
By
convincing
*NL*
her
that
Fanny
_
was
_
very
pretty
,
which
she
had
been
doubting
about
*NL*
before
,
and
that
she
would
be
advantageously
married
,
it
made
her
feel
a
*NL*
sort
of
credit
in
calling
her
niece
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
Fanny
,
''
said
she
,
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
together
afterwards
,
*NL*
and
she
really
had
known
something
like
impatience
to
be
alone
with
her
,
*NL*
and
her
countenance
,
as
she
spoke
,
had
extraordinary
animation
;
``
Well
,
*NL*
Fanny
,
I
have
had
a
very
agreeable
surprise
this
morning
.
I
must
just
*NL*
speak
of
it
_
once
_
,
I
told
Sir
Thomas
I
must
_
once
_
,
and
then
I
*NL*
shall
have
done
.
I
give
you
joy
,
my
dear
niece
.
''
And
looking
at
her
*NL*
complacently
,
she
added
,
``
Humph
,
we
certainly
are
a
handsome
family
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
coloured
,
and
doubted
at
first
what
to
say
;
when
,
hoping
to
assail
*NL*
her
on
her
vulnerable
side
,
she
presently
answered
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
aunt
,
_
you
_
can
not
wish
me
to
do
differently
from
what
I
have
*NL*
done
,
I
am
sure
.
_
You
_
can
not
wish
me
to
marry
;
for
you
would
miss
me
,
*NL*
should
not
you
?
Yes
,
I
am
sure
you
would
miss
me
too
much
for
that
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
my
dear
,
I
should
not
think
of
missing
you
,
when
such
an
offer
as
*NL*
this
comes
in
your
way
.
I
could
do
very
well
without
you
,
if
you
were
*NL*
married
to
a
man
of
such
good
estate
as
Mr.
Crawford
.
And
you
must
be
*NL*
aware
,
Fanny
,
that
it
is
every
young
woman
's
duty
to
accept
such
a
very
*NL*
unexceptionable
offer
as
this
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
almost
the
only
rule
of
conduct
,
the
only
piece
of
advice
,
*NL*
which
Fanny
had
ever
received
from
her
aunt
in
the
course
of
eight
years
*NL*
and
a
half
.
It
silenced
her
.
She
felt
how
unprofitable
contention
would
*NL*
be
.
If
her
aunt
's
feelings
were
against
her
,
nothing
could
be
hoped
from
*NL*
attacking
her
understanding
.
Lady
Bertram
was
quite
talkative
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
what
,
Fanny
,
''
said
she
,
``
I
am
sure
he
fell
in
love
with
*NL*
you
at
the
ball
;
I
am
sure
the
mischief
was
done
that
evening
.
You
did
*NL*
look
remarkably
well
.
Everybody
said
so
.
Sir
Thomas
said
so
.
And
you
*NL*
know
you
had
Chapman
to
help
you
to
dress
.
I
am
very
glad
I
sent
*NL*
Chapman
to
you
.
I
shall
tell
Sir
Thomas
that
I
am
sure
it
was
done
*NL*
that
evening
.
''
And
still
pursuing
the
same
cheerful
thoughts
,
she
soon
*NL*
afterwards
added
,
``
And
will
tell
you
what
,
Fanny
,
which
is
more
than
I
*NL*
did
for
Maria
:
the
next
time
Pug
has
a
litter
you
shall
have
a
puppy
.

CHAPTER
XXXIV
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
had
great
things
to
hear
on
his
return
.
Many
surprises
were
*NL*
awaiting
him
.
The
first
that
occurred
was
not
least
in
interest
:
the
*NL*
appearance
of
Henry
Crawford
and
his
sister
walking
together
through
the
*NL*
village
as
he
rode
into
it
.
He
had
concluded
--
he
had
meant
them
to
be
*NL*
far
distant
.
His
absence
had
been
extended
beyond
a
fortnight
purposely
*NL*
to
avoid
Miss
Crawford
.
He
was
returning
to
Mansfield
with
spirits
ready
*NL*
to
feed
on
melancholy
remembrances
,
and
tender
associations
,
when
her
*NL*
own
fair
self
was
before
him
,
leaning
on
her
brother
's
arm
,
and
he
found
*NL*
himself
receiving
a
welcome
,
unquestionably
friendly
,
from
the
woman
*NL*
whom
,
two
moments
before
,
he
had
been
thinking
of
as
seventy
miles
off
,
*NL*
and
as
farther
,
much
farther
,
from
him
in
inclination
than
any
distance
*NL*
could
express
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
reception
of
him
was
of
a
sort
which
he
could
not
have
hoped
*NL*
for
,
had
he
expected
to
see
her
.
Coming
as
he
did
from
such
a
purport
*NL*
fulfilled
as
had
taken
him
away
,
he
would
have
expected
anything
rather
*NL*
than
a
look
of
satisfaction
,
and
words
of
simple
,
pleasant
meaning
.
*NL*
It
was
enough
to
set
his
heart
in
a
glow
,
and
to
bring
him
home
in
the
*NL*
properest
state
for
feeling
the
full
value
of
the
other
joyful
surprises
*NL*
at
hand
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
's
promotion
,
with
all
its
particulars
,
he
was
soon
master
of
;
*NL*
and
with
such
a
secret
provision
of
comfort
within
his
own
breast
to
*NL*
help
the
joy
,
he
found
in
it
a
source
of
most
gratifying
sensation
and
*NL*
unvarying
cheerfulness
all
dinner-time
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
dinner
,
when
he
and
his
father
were
alone
,
he
had
Fanny
's
history
;
*NL*
and
then
all
the
great
events
of
the
last
fortnight
,
and
the
present
*NL*
situation
of
matters
at
Mansfield
were
known
to
him
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
suspected
what
was
going
on
.
They
sat
so
much
longer
than
usual
in
*NL*
the
dining-parlour
,
that
she
was
sure
they
must
be
talking
of
her
;
and
*NL*
when
tea
at
last
brought
them
away
,
and
she
was
to
be
seen
by
Edmund
*NL*
again
,
she
felt
dreadfully
guilty
.
He
came
to
her
,
sat
down
by
her
,
took
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
pressed
it
kindly
;
and
at
that
moment
she
thought
that
,
*NL*
but
for
the
occupation
and
the
scene
which
the
tea-things
afforded
,
she
*NL*
must
have
betrayed
her
emotion
in
some
unpardonable
excess
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
was
not
intending
,
however
,
by
such
action
,
to
be
conveying
to
her
*NL*
that
unqualified
approbation
and
encouragement
which
her
hopes
drew
*NL*
from
it
.
It
was
designed
only
to
express
his
participation
in
all
that
*NL*
interested
her
,
and
to
tell
her
that
he
had
been
hearing
what
quickened
*NL*
every
feeling
of
affection
.
He
was
,
in
fact
,
entirely
on
his
father
's
*NL*
side
of
the
question
.
His
surprise
was
not
so
great
as
his
father
's
at
*NL*
her
refusing
Crawford
,
because
,
so
far
from
supposing
her
to
consider
*NL*
him
with
anything
like
a
preference
,
he
had
always
believed
it
to
*NL*
be
rather
the
reverse
,
and
could
imagine
her
to
be
taken
perfectly
*NL*
unprepared
,
but
Sir
Thomas
could
not
regard
the
connexion
as
more
*NL*
desirable
than
he
did
.
It
had
every
recommendation
to
him
;
and
while
*NL*
honouring
her
for
what
she
had
done
under
the
influence
of
her
present
*NL*
indifference
,
honouring
her
in
rather
stronger
terms
than
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
could
quite
echo
,
he
was
most
earnest
in
hoping
,
and
sanguine
in
*NL*
believing
,
that
it
would
be
a
match
at
last
,
and
that
,
united
by
mutual
*NL*
affection
,
it
would
appear
that
their
dispositions
were
as
exactly
*NL*
fitted
to
make
them
blessed
in
each
other
,
as
he
was
now
beginning
*NL*
seriously
to
consider
them
.
Crawford
had
been
too
precipitate
.
He
had
*NL*
not
given
her
time
to
attach
herself
.
He
had
begun
at
the
wrong
end
.
*NL*
With
such
powers
as
his
,
however
,
and
such
a
disposition
as
hers
,
Edmund
*NL*
trusted
that
everything
would
work
out
a
happy
conclusion
.
Meanwhile
,
*NL*
he
saw
enough
of
Fanny
's
embarrassment
to
make
him
scrupulously
guard
*NL*
against
exciting
it
a
second
time
,
by
any
word
,
or
look
,
or
movement
.
*NL*
*NL*
Crawford
called
the
next
day
,
and
on
the
score
of
Edmund
's
return
,
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
felt
himself
more
than
licensed
to
ask
him
to
stay
dinner
;
it
was
*NL*
really
a
necessary
compliment
.
He
staid
of
course
,
and
Edmund
had
then
*NL*
ample
opportunity
for
observing
how
he
sped
with
Fanny
,
and
what
degree
*NL*
of
immediate
encouragement
for
him
might
be
extracted
from
her
manners
;
*NL*
and
it
was
so
little
,
so
very
,
very
little
--
every
chance
,
every
*NL*
possibility
of
it
,
resting
upon
her
embarrassment
only
;
if
there
was
*NL*
not
hope
in
her
confusion
,
there
was
hope
in
nothing
else
--
that
he
was
*NL*
almost
ready
to
wonder
at
his
friend
's
perseverance
.
Fanny
was
worth
it
*NL*
all
;
he
held
her
to
be
worth
every
effort
of
patience
,
every
exertion
of
*NL*
mind
,
but
he
did
not
think
he
could
have
gone
on
himself
with
any
woman
*NL*
breathing
,
without
something
more
to
warm
his
courage
than
his
eyes
*NL*
could
discern
in
hers
.
He
was
very
willing
to
hope
that
Crawford
saw
*NL*
clearer
,
and
this
was
the
most
comfortable
conclusion
for
his
friend
*NL*
that
he
could
come
to
from
all
that
he
observed
to
pass
before
,
and
at
,
*NL*
and
after
dinner
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
a
few
circumstances
occurred
which
he
thought
more
*NL*
promising
.
When
he
and
Crawford
walked
into
the
drawing-room
,
his
mother
*NL*
and
Fanny
were
sitting
as
intently
and
silently
at
work
as
if
there
*NL*
were
nothing
else
to
care
for
.
Edmund
could
not
help
noticing
their
*NL*
apparently
deep
tranquillity
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
We
have
not
been
so
silent
all
the
time
,
''
replied
his
mother
.
``
Fanny
*NL*
has
been
reading
to
me
,
and
only
put
the
book
down
upon
hearing
you
*NL*
coming
.
''
And
sure
enough
there
was
a
book
on
the
table
which
had
the
air
*NL*
of
being
very
recently
closed
:
a
volume
of
Shakespeare
.
``
She
often
*NL*
reads
to
me
out
of
those
books
;
and
she
was
in
the
middle
of
a
very
*NL*
fine
speech
of
that
man
's
--
what
's
his
name
,
Fanny
?
--
when
we
heard
your
*NL*
footsteps
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Crawford
took
the
volume
.
``
Let
me
have
the
pleasure
of
finishing
that
*NL*
speech
to
your
ladyship
,
''
said
he
.
``
I
shall
find
it
immediately
.
''
And
by
*NL*
carefully
giving
way
to
the
inclination
of
the
leaves
,
he
did
find
it
,
*NL*
or
within
a
page
or
two
,
quite
near
enough
to
satisfy
Lady
Bertram
,
who
*NL*
assured
him
,
as
soon
as
he
mentioned
the
name
of
Cardinal
Wolsey
,
that
*NL*
he
had
got
the
very
speech
.
Not
a
look
or
an
offer
of
help
had
Fanny
*NL*
given
;
not
a
syllable
for
or
against
.
All
her
attention
was
for
her
*NL*
work
.
She
seemed
determined
to
be
interested
by
nothing
else
.
But
taste
*NL*
was
too
strong
in
her
.
She
could
not
abstract
her
mind
five
minutes
:
she
*NL*
was
forced
to
listen
;
his
reading
was
capital
,
and
her
pleasure
in
good
*NL*
reading
extreme
.
To
_
good
_
reading
,
however
,
she
had
been
long
used
:
*NL*
her
uncle
read
well
,
her
cousins
all
,
Edmund
very
well
,
but
in
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
's
reading
there
was
a
variety
of
excellence
beyond
what
she
had
*NL*
ever
met
with
.
The
King
,
the
Queen
,
Buckingham
,
Wolsey
,
Cromwell
,
all
*NL*
were
given
in
turn
;
for
with
the
happiest
knack
,
the
happiest
power
of
*NL*
jumping
and
guessing
,
he
could
always
alight
at
will
on
the
best
scene
,
*NL*
or
the
best
speeches
of
each
;
and
whether
it
were
dignity
,
or
pride
,
or
*NL*
tenderness
,
or
remorse
,
or
whatever
were
to
be
expressed
,
he
could
do
*NL*
it
with
equal
beauty
.
It
was
truly
dramatic
.
His
acting
had
first
taught
*NL*
Fanny
what
pleasure
a
play
might
give
,
and
his
reading
brought
all
his
*NL*
acting
before
her
again
;
nay
,
perhaps
with
greater
enjoyment
,
for
it
*NL*
came
unexpectedly
,
and
with
no
such
drawback
as
she
had
been
used
to
*NL*
suffer
in
seeing
him
on
the
stage
with
Miss
Bertram
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
watched
the
progress
of
her
attention
,
and
was
amused
and
*NL*
gratified
by
seeing
how
she
gradually
slackened
in
the
needlework
,
which
*NL*
at
the
beginning
seemed
to
occupy
her
totally
:
how
it
fell
from
her
hand
*NL*
while
she
sat
motionless
over
it
,
and
at
last
,
how
the
eyes
which
had
*NL*
appeared
so
studiously
to
avoid
him
throughout
the
day
were
turned
and
*NL*
fixed
on
Crawford
--
fixed
on
him
for
minutes
,
fixed
on
him
,
in
short
,
*NL*
till
the
attraction
drew
Crawford
's
upon
her
,
and
the
book
was
closed
,
*NL*
and
the
charm
was
broken
.
Then
she
was
shrinking
again
into
herself
,
*NL*
and
blushing
and
working
as
hard
as
ever
;
but
it
had
been
enough
to
give
*NL*
Edmund
encouragement
for
his
friend
,
and
as
he
cordially
thanked
him
,
he
*NL*
hoped
to
be
expressing
Fanny
's
secret
feelings
too
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
play
must
be
a
favourite
with
you
,
''
said
he
;
``
you
read
as
if
you
*NL*
knew
it
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
will
be
a
favourite
,
I
believe
,
from
this
hour
,
''
replied
Crawford
;
*NL*
``
but
I
do
not
think
I
have
had
a
volume
of
Shakespeare
in
my
hand
before
*NL*
since
I
was
fifteen
.
I
once
saw
Henry
the
Eighth
acted
,
or
I
have
heard
*NL*
of
it
from
somebody
who
did
,
I
am
not
certain
which
.
But
Shakespeare
*NL*
one
gets
acquainted
with
without
knowing
how
.
It
is
a
part
of
an
*NL*
Englishman
's
constitution
.
His
thoughts
and
beauties
are
so
spread
*NL*
abroad
that
one
touches
them
everywhere
;
one
is
intimate
with
him
by
*NL*
instinct
.
No
man
of
any
brain
can
open
at
a
good
part
of
one
of
his
*NL*
plays
without
falling
into
the
flow
of
his
meaning
immediately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
doubt
one
is
familiar
with
Shakespeare
in
a
degree
,
''
said
Edmund
,
*NL*
``
from
one
's
earliest
years
.
His
celebrated
passages
are
quoted
*NL*
by
everybody
;
they
are
in
half
the
books
we
open
,
and
we
all
talk
*NL*
Shakespeare
,
use
his
similes
,
and
describe
with
his
descriptions
;
but
*NL*
this
is
totally
distinct
from
giving
his
sense
as
you
gave
it
.
To
know
*NL*
him
in
bits
and
scraps
is
common
enough
;
to
know
him
pretty
thoroughly
*NL*
is
,
perhaps
,
not
uncommon
;
but
to
read
him
well
aloud
is
no
everyday
*NL*
talent
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Sir
,
you
do
me
honour
,
''
was
Crawford
's
answer
,
with
a
bow
of
mock
*NL*
gravity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Both
gentlemen
had
a
glance
at
Fanny
,
to
see
if
a
word
of
accordant
*NL*
praise
could
be
extorted
from
her
;
yet
both
feeling
that
it
could
not
*NL*
be
.
Her
praise
had
been
given
in
her
attention
;
_
that
_
must
content
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
's
admiration
was
expressed
,
and
strongly
too
.
``
It
was
*NL*
really
like
being
at
a
play
,
''
said
she
.
``
I
wish
Sir
Thomas
had
been
*NL*
here
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Crawford
was
excessively
pleased
.
If
Lady
Bertram
,
with
all
her
*NL*
incompetency
and
languor
,
could
feel
this
,
the
inference
of
what
her
*NL*
niece
,
alive
and
enlightened
as
she
was
,
must
feel
,
was
elevating
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
a
great
turn
for
acting
,
I
am
sure
,
Mr.
Crawford
,
''
said
her
*NL*
ladyship
soon
afterwards
;
``
and
I
will
tell
you
what
,
I
think
you
will
*NL*
have
a
theatre
,
some
time
or
other
,
at
your
house
in
Norfolk
.
I
mean
*NL*
when
you
are
settled
there
.
I
do
indeed
.
I
think
you
will
fit
up
a
*NL*
theatre
at
your
house
in
Norfolk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
,
ma'am
?
''
cried
he
,
with
quickness
.
``
No
,
no
,
that
will
never
be
.
*NL*
Your
ladyship
is
quite
mistaken
.
No
theatre
at
Everingham
!
Oh
no
!
''
And
*NL*
he
looked
at
Fanny
with
an
expressive
smile
,
which
evidently
meant
,
*NL*
``
That
lady
will
never
allow
a
theatre
at
Everingham
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
saw
it
all
,
and
saw
Fanny
so
determined
_
not
_
to
see
it
,
as
to
*NL*
make
it
clear
that
the
voice
was
enough
to
convey
the
full
meaning
of
*NL*
the
protestation
;
and
such
a
quick
consciousness
of
compliment
,
such
a
*NL*
ready
comprehension
of
a
hint
,
he
thought
,
was
rather
favourable
than
*NL*
not
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
subject
of
reading
aloud
was
farther
discussed
.
The
two
young
men
*NL*
were
the
only
talkers
,
but
they
,
standing
by
the
fire
,
talked
over
the
*NL*
too
common
neglect
of
the
qualification
,
the
total
inattention
to
it
,
*NL*
in
the
ordinary
school-system
for
boys
,
the
consequently
natural
,
yet
in
*NL*
some
instances
almost
unnatural
,
degree
of
ignorance
and
uncouthness
*NL*
of
men
,
of
sensible
and
well-informed
men
,
when
suddenly
called
to
the
*NL*
necessity
of
reading
aloud
,
which
had
fallen
within
their
notice
,
giving
*NL*
instances
of
blunders
,
and
failures
with
their
secondary
causes
,
the
*NL*
want
of
management
of
the
voice
,
of
proper
modulation
and
emphasis
,
of
*NL*
foresight
and
judgment
,
all
proceeding
from
the
first
cause
:
want
of
*NL*
early
attention
and
habit
;
and
Fanny
was
listening
again
with
great
*NL*
entertainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Even
in
my
profession
,
''
said
Edmund
,
with
a
smile
,
``
how
little
the
*NL*
art
of
reading
has
been
studied
!
how
little
a
clear
manner
,
and
good
*NL*
delivery
,
have
been
attended
to
!
I
speak
rather
of
the
past
,
however
,
*NL*
than
the
present
.
There
is
now
a
spirit
of
improvement
abroad
;
but
among
*NL*
those
who
were
ordained
twenty
,
thirty
,
forty
years
ago
,
the
larger
*NL*
number
,
to
judge
by
their
performance
,
must
have
thought
reading
was
*NL*
reading
,
and
preaching
was
preaching
.
It
is
different
now
.
The
subject
*NL*
is
more
justly
considered
.
It
is
felt
that
distinctness
and
energy
may
*NL*
have
weight
in
recommending
the
most
solid
truths
;
and
besides
,
there
is
*NL*
more
general
observation
and
taste
,
a
more
critical
knowledge
diffused
*NL*
than
formerly
;
in
every
congregation
there
is
a
larger
proportion
who
*NL*
know
a
little
of
the
matter
,
and
who
can
judge
and
criticise
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
had
already
gone
through
the
service
once
since
his
ordination
;
*NL*
and
upon
this
being
understood
,
he
had
a
variety
of
questions
from
*NL*
Crawford
as
to
his
feelings
and
success
;
questions
,
which
being
made
,
*NL*
though
with
the
vivacity
of
friendly
interest
and
quick
taste
,
without
*NL*
any
touch
of
that
spirit
of
banter
or
air
of
levity
which
Edmund
knew
to
*NL*
be
most
offensive
to
Fanny
,
he
had
true
pleasure
in
satisfying
;
and
*NL*
when
Crawford
proceeded
to
ask
his
opinion
and
give
his
own
as
to
the
*NL*
properest
manner
in
which
particular
passages
in
the
service
should
be
*NL*
delivered
,
shewing
it
to
be
a
subject
on
which
he
had
thought
before
,
*NL*
and
thought
with
judgment
,
Edmund
was
still
more
and
more
pleased
.
This
*NL*
would
be
the
way
to
Fanny
's
heart
.
She
was
not
to
be
won
by
all
that
*NL*
gallantry
and
wit
and
good-nature
together
could
do
;
or
,
at
least
,
*NL*
she
would
not
be
won
by
them
nearly
so
soon
,
without
the
assistance
of
*NL*
sentiment
and
feeling
,
and
seriousness
on
serious
subjects
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Our
liturgy
,
''
observed
Crawford
,
``
has
beauties
,
which
not
even
a
*NL*
careless
,
slovenly
style
of
reading
can
destroy
;
but
it
has
also
*NL*
redundancies
and
repetitions
which
require
good
reading
not
to
be
felt
.
*NL*
For
myself
,
at
least
,
I
must
confess
being
not
always
so
attentive
as
I
*NL*
ought
to
be
''
-LRB-
here
was
a
glance
at
Fanny
-RRB-
;
``
that
nineteen
times
out
of
*NL*
twenty
I
am
thinking
how
such
a
prayer
ought
to
be
read
,
and
longing
to
*NL*
have
it
to
read
myself
.
Did
you
speak
?
''
stepping
eagerly
to
Fanny
,
and
*NL*
addressing
her
in
a
softened
voice
;
and
upon
her
saying
``
No
,
''
he
added
,
*NL*
``
Are
you
sure
you
did
not
speak
?
I
saw
your
lips
move
.
I
fancied
you
*NL*
might
be
going
to
tell
me
I
ought
to
be
more
attentive
,
and
not
_
allow
_
*NL*
my
thoughts
to
wander
.
Are
not
you
going
to
tell
me
so
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
,
indeed
,
you
know
your
duty
too
well
for
me
to
--
even
supposing
--
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
stopt
,
felt
herself
getting
into
a
puzzle
,
and
could
not
be
*NL*
prevailed
on
to
add
another
word
,
not
by
dint
of
several
minutes
of
*NL*
supplication
and
waiting
.
He
then
returned
to
his
former
station
,
and
*NL*
went
on
as
if
there
had
been
no
such
tender
interruption
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
sermon
,
well
delivered
,
is
more
uncommon
even
than
prayers
well
read
.
*NL*
A
sermon
,
good
in
itself
,
is
no
rare
thing
.
It
is
more
difficult
*NL*
to
speak
well
than
to
compose
well
;
that
is
,
the
rules
and
trick
of
*NL*
composition
are
oftener
an
object
of
study
.
A
thoroughly
good
sermon
,
*NL*
thoroughly
well
delivered
,
is
a
capital
gratification
.
I
can
never
hear
*NL*
such
a
one
without
the
greatest
admiration
and
respect
,
and
more
than
*NL*
half
a
mind
to
take
orders
and
preach
myself
.
There
is
something
in
the
*NL*
eloquence
of
the
pulpit
,
when
it
is
really
eloquence
,
which
is
entitled
*NL*
to
the
highest
praise
and
honour
.
The
preacher
who
can
touch
and
affect
*NL*
such
an
heterogeneous
mass
of
hearers
,
on
subjects
limited
,
and
long
*NL*
worn
threadbare
in
all
common
hands
;
who
can
say
anything
new
or
*NL*
striking
,
anything
that
rouses
the
attention
without
offending
the
*NL*
taste
,
or
wearing
out
the
feelings
of
his
hearers
,
is
a
man
whom
one
*NL*
could
not
,
in
his
public
capacity
,
honour
enough
.
I
should
like
to
be
*NL*
such
a
man
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
laughed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
should
indeed
.
I
never
listened
to
a
distinguished
preacher
in
my
*NL*
life
without
a
sort
of
envy
.
But
then
,
I
must
have
a
London
audience
.
*NL*
I
could
not
preach
but
to
the
educated
;
to
those
who
were
capable
of
*NL*
estimating
my
composition
.
And
I
do
not
know
that
I
should
be
fond
of
*NL*
preaching
often
;
now
and
then
,
perhaps
once
or
twice
in
the
spring
,
*NL*
after
being
anxiously
expected
for
half
a
dozen
Sundays
together
;
but
*NL*
not
for
a
constancy

it
would
not
do
for
a
constancy

*NL*
*NL*
Here
Fanny
,
who
could
not
but
listen
,
involuntarily
shook
her
head
,
*NL*
and
Crawford
was
instantly
by
her
side
again
,
entreating
to
know
her
*NL*
meaning
;
and
as
Edmund
perceived
,
by
his
drawing
in
a
chair
,
and
sitting
*NL*
down
close
by
her
,
that
it
was
to
be
a
very
thorough
attack
,
that
looks
*NL*
and
undertones
were
to
be
well
tried
,
he
sank
as
quietly
as
possible
*NL*
into
a
corner
,
turned
his
back
,
and
took
up
a
newspaper
,
very
sincerely
*NL*
wishing
that
dear
little
Fanny
might
be
persuaded
into
explaining
away
*NL*
that
shake
of
the
head
to
the
satisfaction
of
her
ardent
lover
;
and
as
*NL*
earnestly
trying
to
bury
every
sound
of
the
business
from
himself
in

murmurs
of
his
own
,
over
the
various
advertisements
of

*NL*
Fanny
,
meanwhile
,
vexed
with
herself
for
not
having
been
as
motionless
*NL*
as
she
was
speechless
,
and
grieved
to
the
heart
to
see
Edmund
's
*NL*
arrangements

was
trying
by
everything
in
the
power
of
her
modest

gentle
nature

to
repulse
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
avoid
both
his
looks

inquiries
;

he
,
unrepulsable
,
was
persisting
in
both
.
*NL*
*NL*
``

In

her
``

repeated
twice

over

In

eager

he
went
on

reurging

my
present
entreaty

you
do
not
understand

I
will
explain
to
you
*NL*
instantly
all
that
makes
me
urge
you
in
this
manner
,
all
that
gives
me
*NL*
an
interest
in
what
you
look
and
do
,
and
excites
my
present
curiosity

I
*NL*
will
not
leave
you
to
wonder
long

''
*NL*
*NL*
In
spite
of
herself
,
she
could
not
help
half
a
smile
,
but
she
said
*NL*
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
shook
your
head
at
my
acknowledging
that
I
should
not
like
to
*NL*
engage
in
the
duties
of
a
clergyman
always
for
a
constancy
.
Yes
,
that
*NL*
was
the
word
.
Constancy
:
I
am
not
afraid
of
the
word
.
I
would
spell
it
,
*NL*
read
it
,
write
it
with
anybody

I
see
nothing
alarming
in
the
word

Did
*NL*
you
think
I
ought
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Perhaps
,
sir
,
''
said
Fanny
,
wearied
at
last
into
speaking
--
``
perhaps
,
*NL*
sir
,
I
thought
it
was
a
pity
you
did
not
always
know
yourself
as
well
as
*NL*
you
seemed
to
do
at
that
moment
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Crawford
,
delighted
to
get
her
to
speak
at
any
rate
,
was
determined
*NL*
to
keep
it
up
;
and
poor
Fanny
,
who
had
hoped
to
silence
him
by
such
an
*NL*
extremity
of
reproof
,
found
herself
sadly
mistaken
,
and
that
it
was
only
*NL*
a
change
from
one
object
of
curiosity
and
one
set
of
words
to
another
.
*NL*
He
had
always
something
to
entreat
the
explanation
of
.
The
opportunity
*NL*
was
too
fair
.
None
such
had
occurred
since
his
seeing
her
in
her
uncle
's
*NL*
room
,
none
such
might
occur
again
before
his
leaving
Mansfield
.
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
's
being
just
on
the
other
side
of
the
table
was
a
trifle
,
*NL*
for
she
might
always
be
considered
as
only
half-awake
,
and
Edmund
's
*NL*
advertisements
were
still
of
the
first
utility
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Well
,
''
said
Crawford
,
after
a
course
of
rapid
questions
and
reluctant
*NL*
answers
;
``
I
am
happier
than
I
was
,
because
I
now
understand
more
clearly
*NL*
your
opinion
of
me
.
You
think
me
unsteady
:
easily
swayed
by
the
whim
of
*NL*
the
moment
,
easily
tempted
,
easily
put
aside
.
With
such
an
opinion
,
no
*NL*
wonder
that
.
But
we
shall
see
.
It
is
not
by
protestations
that
I
shall
*NL*
endeavour
to
convince
you
I
am
wronged
;
it
is
not
by
telling
you
that
my
*NL*
affections
are
steady
.
My
conduct
shall
speak
for
me
;
absence
,
distance
,
*NL*
time
shall
speak
for
me
.
_
They
_
shall
prove
that
,
as
far
as
you
can
be
*NL*
deserved
by
anybody
,
I
do
deserve
you
.
You
are
infinitely
my
superior
*NL*
in
merit
;
all
_
that
_
I
know
.
You
have
qualities
which
I
had
not
before
*NL*
supposed
to
exist
in
such
a
degree
in
any
human
creature
.
You
have
some
*NL*
touches
of
the
angel
in
you
beyond
what
--
not
merely
beyond
what
one
*NL*
sees
,
because
one
never
sees
anything
like
it
--
but
beyond
what
one
*NL*
fancies
might
be
.
But
still
I
am
not
frightened
.
It
is
not
by
equality
*NL*
of
merit
that
you
can
be
won
.
That
is
out
of
the
question
.
It
is
he
*NL*
who
sees
and
worships
your
merit
the
strongest
,
who
loves
you
most
*NL*
devotedly
,
that
has
the
best
right
to
a
return
.
There
I
build
my
*NL*
confidence
.
By
that
right
I
do
and
will
deserve
you
;
and
when
once
*NL*
convinced
that
my
attachment
is
what
I
declare
it
,
I
know
you
too
well
*NL*
not
to
entertain
the
warmest
hopes
.
Yes
,
dearest
,
sweetest
Fanny
.
Nay
''
*NL*
-LRB-
seeing
her
draw
back
displeased
-RRB-
,
``
forgive
me
.
Perhaps
I
have
as
yet
*NL*
no
right
;
but
by
what
other
name
can
I
call
you
?
Do
you
suppose
you
are
*NL*
ever
present
to
my
imagination
under
any
other
?
No
,
it
is
`
Fanny
'
that
*NL*
I
think
of
all
day
,
and
dream
of
all
night
.
You
have
given
the
name
such
*NL*
reality
of
sweetness
,
that
nothing
else
can
now
be
descriptive
of
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
hardly
have
kept
her
seat
any
longer
,
or
have
refrained
from
*NL*
at
least
trying
to
get
away
in
spite
of
all
the
too
public
opposition
*NL*
she
foresaw
to
it
,
had
it
not
been
for
the
sound
of
approaching
relief
,
*NL*
the
very
sound
which
she
had
been
long
watching
for
,
and
long
thinking
*NL*
strangely
delayed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
solemn
procession
,
headed
by
Baddeley
,
of
tea-board
,
urn
,
and
*NL*
cake-bearers
,
made
its
appearance
,
and
delivered
her
from
a
grievous
*NL*
imprisonment
of
body
and
mind
.
Mr.
Crawford
was
obliged
to
move
.
She
was
*NL*
at
liberty
,
she
was
busy
,
she
was
protected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
not
sorry
to
be
admitted
again
among
the
number
of
those
who
*NL*
might
speak
and
hear
.
But
though
the
conference
had
seemed
full
long
to
*NL*
him
,
and
though
on
looking
at
Fanny
he
saw
rather
a
flush
of
vexation
,
*NL*
he
inclined
to
hope
that
so
much
could
not
have
been
said
and
listened
*NL*
to
without
some
profit
to
the
speaker
.

CHAPTER
XXXV
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
had
determined
that
it
belonged
entirely
to
Fanny
to
chuse
*NL*
whether
her
situation
with
regard
to
Crawford
should
be
mentioned
*NL*
between
them
or
not
;
and
that
if
she
did
not
lead
the
way
,
it
should
*NL*
never
be
touched
on
by
him
;
but
after
a
day
or
two
of
mutual
reserve
,
he
*NL*
was
induced
by
his
father
to
change
his
mind
,
and
try
what
his
influence
*NL*
might
do
for
his
friend
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
day
,
and
a
very
early
day
,
was
actually
fixed
for
the
Crawfords
'
*NL*
departure
;
and
Sir
Thomas
thought
it
might
be
as
well
to
make
one
*NL*
more
effort
for
the
young
man
before
he
left
Mansfield
,
that
all
his
*NL*
professions
and
vows
of
unshaken
attachment
might
have
as
much
hope
to
*NL*
sustain
them
as
possible
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
most
cordially
anxious
for
the
perfection
of
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
's
character
in
that
point
.
He
wished
him
to
be
a
model
of
*NL*
constancy
;
and
fancied
the
best
means
of
effecting
it
would
be
by
not
*NL*
trying
him
too
long
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
was
not
unwilling
to
be
persuaded
to
engage
in
the
business
;
he
*NL*
wanted
to
know
Fanny
's
feelings
.
She
had
been
used
to
consult
him
in
*NL*
every
difficulty
,
and
he
loved
her
too
well
to
bear
to
be
denied
her
*NL*
confidence
now
;
he
hoped
to
be
of
service
to
her
,
he
thought
he
must
be
*NL*
of
service
to
her
;
whom
else
had
she
to
open
her
heart
to
?
If
she
did
*NL*
not
need
counsel
,
she
must
need
the
comfort
of
communication
.
Fanny
*NL*
estranged
from
him
,
silent
and
reserved
,
was
an
unnatural
state
of
*NL*
things
;
a
state
which
he
must
break
through
,
and
which
he
could
easily
*NL*
learn
to
think
she
was
wanting
him
to
break
through
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
speak
to
her
,
sir
:
I
will
take
the
first
opportunity
of
speaking
*NL*
to
her
alone
,
''
was
the
result
of
such
thoughts
as
these
;
and
upon
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
's
information
of
her
being
at
that
very
time
walking
alone
in
the
*NL*
shrubbery
,
he
instantly
joined
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
come
to
walk
with
you
,
Fanny
,
''
said
he
.
``
Shall
I
?
''
Drawing
her
*NL*
arm
within
his
.
``
It
is
a
long
while
since
we
have
had
a
comfortable
walk
*NL*
together
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
assented
to
it
all
rather
by
look
than
word
.
Her
spirits
were
low
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
But
,
Fanny
,
''
he
presently
added
,
``
in
order
to
have
a
comfortable
walk
,
*NL*
something
more
is
necessary
than
merely
pacing
this
gravel
together
.
You
*NL*
must
talk
to
me
.
I
know
you
have
something
on
your
mind
.
I
know
what
you
*NL*
are
thinking
of
.
You
can
not
suppose
me
uninformed
.
Am
I
to
hear
of
it
*NL*
from
everybody
but
Fanny
herself
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
at
once
agitated
and
dejected
,
replied
,
``
If
you
hear
of
it
from
*NL*
everybody
,
cousin
,
there
can
be
nothing
for
me
to
tell
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Not
of
facts
,
perhaps
;
but
of
feelings
,
Fanny
.
No
one
but
you
can
tell
*NL*
me
them
.
I
do
not
mean
to
press
you
,
however
.
If
it
is
not
what
you
wish
*NL*
yourself
,
I
have
done
.
I
had
thought
it
might
be
a
relief
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
afraid
we
think
too
differently
for
me
to
find
any
relief
in
*NL*
talking
of
what
I
feel
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
suppose
that
we
think
differently
?
I
have
no
idea
of
it
.
I
dare
*NL*
say
that
,
on
a
comparison
of
our
opinions
,
they
would
be
found
as
much
*NL*
alike
as
they
have
been
used
to
be
:
to
the
point
--
I
consider
Crawford
's
*NL*
proposals
as
most
advantageous
and
desirable
,
if
you
could
return
his
*NL*
affection
.
I
consider
it
as
most
natural
that
all
your
family
should
*NL*
wish
you
could
return
it
;
but
that
,
as
you
can
not
,
you
have
done
exactly
*NL*
as
you
ought
in
refusing
him

Can
there
be
any
disagreement
between
us
*NL*
here
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
no
!
But
I
thought
you
blamed
me

I
thought
you
were
against
me

is
such
a
comfort
!

*NL*
*NL*
``
This
comfort
you
might
have
had
sooner

Fanny
,
had
you
sought
it

But
*NL*
how
could
you
possibly
suppose
me
against
you
?
How
could
you
imagine
me
*NL*
an
advocate
for
marriage
without
love
?
Were
I
even
careless
in
general
*NL*
on
such
matters

how
could
you
imagine
me
so
where
your
happiness
was
at

stake

*NL*
*NL*
``
My

wrong

``
As

I

you
perfectly
right

Can

admit

It
is
disgraceful
to

accepting

not

so
comfortable

days

days

So
far
your
conduct

been
faultless

matter
does
not
end
here

Crawford

no
common
attachment

perseveres

with
the
hope
of

creating
that
regard
which
had
not
been
created
before

This

we

be
a
work

very

array

before

he
has
to
unfasten

so
many

have
confirmed

*NL*
which
are
considerably
tightened

I
know

the
apprehension

There
never
were
two
people
more
*NL*
dissimilar
.
We
have
not
one
taste
in
common
.
We
should
be
miserable
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
mistaken
,
Fanny
.
The
dissimilarity
is
not
so
strong
.
You
are
*NL*
quite
enough
alike
.
You
_
have
_
tastes
in
common
.
You
have
moral
and
*NL*
literary
tastes
in
common
.
You
have
both
warm
hearts
and
benevolent
*NL*
feelings
;
and
,
Fanny
,
who
that
heard
him
read
,
and
saw
you
listen
to
*NL*
Shakespeare
the
other
night
,
will
think
you
unfitted
as
companions
?
You
*NL*
forget
yourself
:
there
is
a
decided
difference
in
your
tempers
,
I
allow
.
*NL*
He
is
lively
,
you
are
serious
;
but
so
much
the
better
:
his
spirits
will
*NL*
support
yours
.
It
is
your
disposition
to
be
easily
dejected
and
to
fancy
*NL*
difficulties
greater
than
they
are
.
His
cheerfulness
will
counteract
*NL*
this
.
He
sees
difficulties
nowhere
:
and
his
pleasantness
and
gaiety
will
*NL*
be
a
constant
support
to
you
.
Your
being
so
far
unlike
,
Fanny
,
does
not
*NL*
in
the
smallest
degree
make
against
the
probability
of
your
happiness
*NL*
together
:
do
not
imagine
it
.
I
am
myself
convinced
that
it
is
rather
a
*NL*
favourable
circumstance
.
I
am
perfectly
persuaded
that
the
tempers
*NL*
had
better
be
unlike
:
I
mean
unlike
in
the
flow
of
the
spirits
,
in
*NL*
the
manners
,
in
the
inclination
for
much
or
little
company
,
in
the
*NL*
propensity
to
talk
or
to
be
silent
,
to
be
grave
or
to
be
gay
.
Some
*NL*
opposition
here
is
,
I
am
thoroughly
convinced
,
friendly
to
matrimonial
*NL*
happiness
.
I
exclude
extremes
,
of
course
;
and
a
very
close
resemblance
*NL*
in
all
those
points
would
be
the
likeliest
way
to
produce
an
extreme
.
*NL*
A
counteraction
,
gentle
and
continual
,
is
the
best
safeguard
of
manners
*NL*
and
conduct
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Full
well
could
Fanny
guess
where
his
thoughts
were
now
:
Miss
Crawford
's
*NL*
power
was
all
returning
.
He
had
been
speaking
of
her
cheerfully
from
the
*NL*
hour
of
his
coming
home
.
His
avoiding
her
was
quite
at
an
end
.
He
had
*NL*
dined
at
the
Parsonage
only
the
preceding
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
leaving
him
to
his
happier
thoughts
for
some
minutes
,
Fanny
,
*NL*
feeling
it
due
to
herself
,
returned
to
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
said
,
``
It
*NL*
is
not
merely
in
_
temper
_
that
I
consider
him
as
totally
unsuited
to
*NL*
myself
;
though
,
in
_
that
_
respect
,
I
think
the
difference
between
us
too
*NL*
great
,
infinitely
too
great
:
his
spirits
often
oppress
me
;
but
there
is
*NL*
something
in
him
which
I
object
to
still
more
.
I
must
say
,
cousin
,
that
*NL*
I
can
not
approve
his
character
.
I
have
not
thought
well
of
him
from
the
*NL*
time
of
the
play
.
I
then
saw
him
behaving
,
as
it
appeared
to
me
,
so
*NL*
very
improperly
and
unfeelingly
--
I
may
speak
of
it
now
because
it
is
all
*NL*
over
--
so
improperly
by
poor
Mr.
Rushworth
,
not
seeming
to
care
how
he
*NL*
exposed
or
hurt
him
,
and
paying
attentions
to
my
cousin
Maria
,
which
--
in
*NL*
short
,
at
the
time
of
the
play
,
I
received
an
impression
which
will
*NL*
never
be
got
over
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
Fanny
,
''
replied
Edmund
,
scarcely
hearing
her
to
the
end
,
``
let
*NL*
us
not
,
any
of
us
,
be
judged
by
what
we
appeared
at
that
period
of
*NL*
general
folly
.
The
time
of
the
play
is
a
time
which
I
hate
to
recollect
.
*NL*
Maria
was
wrong
,
Crawford
was
wrong
,
we
were
all
wrong
together
;
but
*NL*
none
so
wrong
as
myself
.
Compared
with
me
,
all
the
rest
were
blameless
.
*NL*
I
was
playing
the
fool
with
my
eyes
open
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
a
bystander
,
''
said
Fanny
,
``
perhaps
I
saw
more
than
you
did
;
and
I
do
*NL*
think
that
Mr.
Rushworth
was
sometimes
very
jealous
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
possibly
.
No
wonder
.
Nothing
could
be
more
improper
than
the
whole
*NL*
business
.
I
am
shocked
whenever
I
think
that
Maria
could
be
capable
of
*NL*
it
;
but
,
if
she
could
undertake
the
part
,
we
must
not
be
surprised
at
*NL*
the
rest
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Before
the
play
,
I
am
much
mistaken
if
_
Julia
_
did
not
think
he
was
*NL*
paying
her
attentions
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Julia
!
I
have
heard
before
from
some
one
of
his
being
in
love
with
*NL*
Julia
;
but
I
could
never
see
anything
of
it
.
And
,
Fanny
,
though
I
hope
I
*NL*
do
justice
to
my
sisters
'
good
qualities
,
I
think
it
very
possible
that
*NL*
they
might
,
one
or
both
,
be
more
desirous
of
being
admired
by
Crawford
,
*NL*
and
might
shew
that
desire
rather
more
unguardedly
than
was
perfectly
*NL*
prudent
.
I
can
remember
that
they
were
evidently
fond
of
his
society
;
*NL*
and
with
such
encouragement
,
a
man
like
Crawford
,
lively
,
and
it
may
*NL*
be
,
a
little
unthinking
,
might
be
led
on
to
--
there
could
be
nothing
very
*NL*
striking
,
because
it
is
clear
that
he
had
no
pretensions
:
his
heart
was
*NL*
reserved
for
you
.
And
I
must
say
,
that
its
being
for
you
has
raised
him
*NL*
inconceivably
in
my
opinion
.
It
does
him
the
highest
honour
;
it
shews
*NL*
his
proper
estimation
of
the
blessing
of
domestic
happiness
and
pure
*NL*
attachment
.
It
proves
him
unspoilt
by
his
uncle
.
It
proves
him
,
in
*NL*
short
,
everything
that
I
had
been
used
to
wish
to
believe
him
,
and
*NL*
feared
he
was
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
persuaded
that
he
does
not
think
,
as
he
ought
,
on
serious
*NL*
subjects
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Say
,
rather
,
that
he
has
not
thought
at
all
upon
serious
subjects
,
*NL*
which
I
believe
to
be
a
good
deal
the
case
.
How
could
it
be
otherwise
,
*NL*
with
such
an
education
and
adviser
?
Under
the
disadvantages
,
indeed
,
*NL*
which
both
have
had
,
is
it
not
wonderful
that
they
should
be
what
they
*NL*
are
?
Crawford
's
_
feelings
_
,
I
am
ready
to
acknowledge
,
have
hitherto
*NL*
been
too
much
his
guides
.
Happily
,
those
feelings
have
generally
been
*NL*
good
.
You
will
supply
the
rest
;
and
a
most
fortunate
man
he
is
to
attach
*NL*
himself
to
such
a
creature
--
to
a
woman
who
,
firm
as
a
rock
in
her
own
*NL*
principles
,
has
a
gentleness
of
character
so
well
adapted
to
recommend
*NL*
them
.
He
has
chosen
his
partner
,
indeed
,
with
rare
felicity
.
He
will
*NL*
make
you
happy
,
Fanny
;
I
know
he
will
make
you
happy
;
but
you
will
make
*NL*
him
everything
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
would
not
engage
in
such
a
charge
,
''
cried
Fanny
,
in
a
shrinking
*NL*
accent
;
``
in
such
an
office
of
high
responsibility
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
As
usual
,
believing
yourself
unequal
to
anything

fancying
everything
*NL*
too
much
for
you

Well
,
though
I
may
not
be
able
to
persuade
you
into
*NL*
different
feelings
,
you
will
be
persuaded
into
them

I
trust

I
confess
*NL*
myself
sincerely
anxious

have
no

Crawford
's
well-doing

Next
to
your
happiness

has
the
first
*NL*
claim
on
me

You
are
aware
of
my
having
no
common
interest
in
Crawford
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
too
well
aware
of
it
to
have
anything
to
say
;
and
they
walked
*NL*
on
together
some
fifty
yards
in
mutual
silence
and
abstraction
.
Edmund
*NL*
first
began
again
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
very
much
pleased
by
her
manner
of
speaking
of
it
yesterday
,
*NL*
particularly
pleased
,
because
I
had
not
depended
upon
her
seeing
*NL*
everything
in
so
just
a
light
.
I
knew
she
was
very
fond
of
you
;
but
yet
*NL*
I
was
afraid
of
her
not
estimating
your
worth
to
her
brother
quite
as
*NL*
it
deserved
,
and
of
her
regretting
that
he
had
not
rather
fixed
on
*NL*
some
woman
of
distinction
or
fortune
.
I
was
afraid
of
the
bias
of
those
*NL*
worldly
maxims
,
which
she
has
been
too
much
used
to
hear
.
But
it
was
*NL*
very
different
.
She
spoke
of
you
,
Fanny
,
just
as
she
ought
.
She
desires
*NL*
the
connexion
as
warmly
as
your
uncle
or
myself
.
We
had
a
long
talk
*NL*
about
it
.
I
should
not
have
mentioned
the
subject
,
though
very
anxious
*NL*
to
know
her
sentiments
;
but
I
had
not
been
in
the
room
five
minutes
*NL*
before
she
began
introducing
it
with
all
that
openness
of
heart
,
and
*NL*
sweet
peculiarity
of
manner
,
that
spirit
and
ingenuousness
which
are
so
*NL*
much
a
part
of
herself
.
Mrs.
Grant
laughed
at
her
for
her
rapidity
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Was
Mrs.
Grant
in
the
room
,
then
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
when
I
reached
the
house
I
found
the
two
sisters
together
by
*NL*
themselves
;
and
when
once
we
had
begun
,
we
had
not
done
with
you
,
Fanny
,
*NL*
till
Crawford
and
Dr.
Grant
came
in
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
above
a
week
since
I
saw
Miss
Crawford

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
she
laments
it
;
yet
owns
it
may
have
been
best

You
will
see
her
,
*NL*
however
,
before
she
goes
.
She
is
very
angry
with
you
,
Fanny
;
you
must
be
*NL*
prepared
for
that
.
She
calls
herself
very
angry
,
but
you
can
imagine
her
*NL*
anger
.
It
is
the
regret
and
disappointment
of
a
sister
,
who
thinks
her
*NL*
brother
has
a
right
to
everything
he
may
wish
for
,
at
the
first
moment
.
*NL*
She
is
hurt
,
as
you
would
be
for
William
;
but
she
loves
and
esteems
you
*NL*
with
all
her
heart
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
knew
she
would
be
very
angry
with
me

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dearest
Fanny

cried
Edmund
,
pressing
her
arm
closer
to
him
,
``
do
*NL*
not
let
the
idea
of
her
anger
distress
you

It
is
anger
to
be
talked
*NL*
of
rather
than
felt
.
Her
heart
is
made
for
love
and
kindness
,
not
for
*NL*
resentment

I
wish
you
could
have
overheard
her
tribute
of
praise
;

I
wish
you
could
have
seen
her
countenance
,
when
she
said
that
you
*NL*
_
should

be
Henry

wife

And
I
observed
that
she
always
spoke
of
you
*NL*
as
`
Fanny
,
'
which
she
was
never
used
to
do
;
and
it
had
a
sound
of
most
*NL*
sisterly
cordiality
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
Mrs.
Grant

did
she
say

did
she
speak

she
there
all
the
*NL*
time

*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

she
was
agreeing
exactly
with
her
sister

The
surprise
of
your
*NL*
refusal
,
Fanny
,
seems
to
have
been
unbounded
.
That
you
could
refuse
such
*NL*
a
man
as
Henry
Crawford
seems
more
than
they
can
understand
.
I
said
what
*NL*
I
could
for
you
;
but
in
good
truth
,
as
they
stated
the
case
--
you
must
*NL*
prove
yourself
to
be
in
your
senses
as
soon
as
you
can
by
a
different
*NL*
conduct
;
nothing
else
will
satisfy
them
.
But
this
is
teasing
you
.
I
have
*NL*
done
.
Do
not
turn
away
from
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
_
should
_
have
thought
,
''
said
Fanny
,
after
a
pause
of
recollection
and
*NL*
exertion
,
``
that
every
woman
must
have
felt
the
possibility
of
a
man
's
*NL*
not
being
approved
,
not
being
loved
by
some
one
of
her
sex
at
least
,
let
*NL*
him
be
ever
so
generally
agreeable
.
Let
him
have
all
the
perfections
*NL*
in
the
world
,
I
think
it
ought
not
to
be
set
down
as
certain
that
a
man
*NL*
must
be
acceptable
to
every
woman
he
may
happen
to
like
himself
.
But
,
*NL*
even
supposing
it
is
so
,
allowing
Mr.
Crawford
to
have
all
the
claims
*NL*
which
his
sisters
think
he
has
,
how
was
I
to
be
prepared
to
meet
him
*NL*
with
any
feeling
answerable
to
his
own
?
He
took
me
wholly
by
surprise
.
*NL*
I
had
not
an
idea
that
his
behaviour
to
me
before
had
any
meaning
;
and
*NL*
surely
I
was
not
to
be
teaching
myself
to
like
him
only
because
he
was
*NL*
taking
what
seemed
very
idle
notice
of
me
.
In
my
situation
,
it
would
*NL*
have
been
the
extreme
of
vanity
to
be
forming
expectations
on
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
.
I
am
sure
his
sisters
,
rating
him
as
they
do
,
must
have
*NL*
thought
it
so
,
supposing
he
had
meant
nothing
.
How
,
then
,
was
I
to
*NL*
be
--
to
be
in
love
with
him
the
moment
he
said
he
was
with
me
?
How
was
I
*NL*
to
have
an
attachment
at
his
service
,
as
soon
as
it
was
asked
for
?
His
*NL*
sisters
should
consider
me
as
well
as
him
.
The
higher
his
deserts
,
the
*NL*
more
improper
for
me
ever
to
have
thought
of
him
.
And
,
and
--
we
think
*NL*
very
differently
of
the
nature
of
women
,
if
they
can
imagine
a
woman
so
*NL*
very
soon
capable
of
returning
an
affection
as
this
seems
to
imply
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
dear
,
dear
Fanny
,
now
I
have
the
truth
.
I
know
this
to
be
the
truth
;
*NL*
and
most
worthy
of
you
are
such
feelings
.
I
had
attributed
them
to
you
*NL*
before
.
I
thought
I
could
understand
you
.
You
have
now
given
exactly
*NL*
the
explanation
which
I
ventured
to
make
for
you
to
your
friend
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Grant
,
and
they
were
both
better
satisfied
,
though
your
warm-hearted
*NL*
friend
was
still
run
away
with
a
little
by
the
enthusiasm
of
her
*NL*
fondness
for
Henry
.
I
told
them
that
you
were
of
all
human
creatures
the
*NL*
one
over
whom
habit
had
most
power
and
novelty
least
;
and
that
the
very
*NL*
circumstance
of
the
novelty
of
Crawford
's
addresses
was
against
him
.
*NL*
Their
being
so
new
and
so
recent
was
all
in
their
disfavour
;
that
you
*NL*
could
tolerate
nothing
that
you
were
not
used
to
;
and
a
great
deal
more
*NL*
to
the
same
purpose
,
to
give
them
a
knowledge
of
your
character
.
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
made
us
laugh
by
her
plans
of
encouragement
for
her
brother
.
*NL*
She
meant
to
urge
him
to
persevere
in
the
hope
of
being
loved
in
time
,
*NL*
and
of
having
his
addresses
most
kindly
received
at
the
end
of
about
ten
*NL*
years
'
happy
marriage
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
with
difficulty
give
the
smile
that
was
here
asked
for
.
Her
*NL*
feelings
were
all
in
revolt
.
She
feared
she
had
been
doing
wrong
:
saying
*NL*
too
much
,
overacting
the
caution
which
she
had
been
fancying
necessary
;
*NL*
in
guarding
against
one
evil
,
laying
herself
open
to
another
;
and
to
*NL*
have
Miss
Crawford
's
liveliness
repeated
to
her
at
such
a
moment
,
and
on
*NL*
such
a
subject
,
was
a
bitter
aggravation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
saw
weariness
and
distress
in
her
face
,
and
immediately
resolved
*NL*
to
forbear
all
farther
discussion
;
and
not
even
to
mention
the
name
*NL*
of
Crawford
again
,
except
as
it
might
be
connected
with
what
_
must
_
be
*NL*
agreeable
to
her
.
On
this
principle
,
he
soon
afterwards
observed
--
``
They
*NL*
go
on
Monday
.
You
are
sure
,
therefore
,
of
seeing
your
friend
either
*NL*
to-morrow
or
Sunday
.
They
really
go
on
Monday
;
and
I
was
within
a
trifle
*NL*
of
being
persuaded
to
stay
at
Lessingby
till
that
very
day
!
I
had
almost
*NL*
promised
it
.
What
a
difference
it
might
have
made
!
Those
five
or
six
*NL*
days
more
at
Lessingby
might
have
been
felt
all
my
life
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
were
near
staying
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Very
.
I
was
most
kindly
pressed
,
and
had
nearly
consented
.
Had
I
*NL*
received
any
letter
from
Mansfield
,
to
tell
me
how
you
were
all
going
*NL*
on
,
I
believe
I
should
certainly
have
staid
;
but
I
knew
nothing
that
*NL*
had
happened
here
for
a
fortnight
,
and
felt
that
I
had
been
away
long
*NL*
enough
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
spent
your
time
pleasantly
there
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
that
is
,
it
was
the
fault
of
my
own
mind
if
I
did
not
.
They
were
*NL*
all
very
pleasant
.
I
doubt
their
finding
me
so
.
I
took
uneasiness
with
*NL*
me
,
and
there
was
no
getting
rid
of
it
till
I
was
in
Mansfield
again
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
Miss
Owens
--
you
liked
them
,
did
not
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
well
.
Pleasant
,
good-humoured
,
unaffected
girls
.
But
I
am
*NL*
spoilt

Fanny
,
for
common
female
society
.
Good-humoured
,
unaffected
*NL*
girls
will
not
do
for
a
man
who
has
been
used
to
sensible
women
.
They
*NL*
are
two
distinct
orders
of
being
.
You
and
Miss
Crawford
have
made
me
too
*NL*
nice

''
*NL*
*NL*
Still
,
however
,
Fanny
was
oppressed
and
wearied
;
he
saw
it
in
her
looks
,
*NL*
it
could
not
be
talked
away
;
and
attempting
it
no
more
,
he
led
her
*NL*
directly
,
with
the
kind
authority
of
a
privileged
guardian
,
into
the
*NL*
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXVI
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
now
believed
himself
perfectly
acquainted
with
all
that
Fanny
*NL*
could
tell
,
or
could
leave
to
be
conjectured
of
her
sentiments
,
and
he
*NL*
was
satisfied
.
It
had
been
,
as
he
before
presumed
,
too
hasty
a
measure
*NL*
on
Crawford
's
side
,
and
time
must
be
given
to
make
the
idea
first
*NL*
familiar
,
and
then
agreeable
to
her
.
She
must
be
used
to
the
*NL*
consideration
of
his
being
in
love
with
her
,
and
then
a
return
of
*NL*
affection
might
not
be
very
distant
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
gave
this
opinion
as
the
result
of
the
conversation
to
his
father
;
*NL*
and
recommended
there
being
nothing
more
said
to
her
:
no
farther
*NL*
attempts
to
influence
or
persuade
;
but
that
everything
should
be
left
to
*NL*
Crawford
's
assiduities
,
and
the
natural
workings
of
her
own
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
promised
that
it
should
be
so
.
Edmund
's
account
of
Fanny
's
*NL*
disposition
he
could
believe
to
be
just
;
he
supposed
she
had
all
those
*NL*
feelings
,
but
he
must
consider
it
as
very
unfortunate
that
she
_
had
_
;
*NL*
for
,
less
willing
than
his
son
to
trust
to
the
future
,
he
could
not
*NL*
help
fearing
that
if
such
very
long
allowances
of
time
and
habit
were
*NL*
necessary
for
her
,
she
might
not
have
persuaded
herself
into
receiving
*NL*
his
addresses
properly
before
the
young
man
's
inclination
for
paying
*NL*
them
were
over
.
There
was
nothing
to
be
done
,
however
,
but
to
submit
*NL*
quietly
and
hope
the
best
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
promised
visit
from
``
her
friend
,
''
as
Edmund
called
Miss
Crawford
,
*NL*
was
a
formidable
threat
to
Fanny
,
and
she
lived
in
continual
terror
of
*NL*
it
.
As
a
sister
,
so
partial
and
so
angry
,
and
so
little
scrupulous
of
*NL*
what
she
said
,
and
in
another
light
so
triumphant
and
secure
,
she
was
in
*NL*
every
way
an
object
of
painful
alarm
.
Her
displeasure
,
her
penetration
,
*NL*
and
her
happiness
were
all
fearful
to
encounter
;
and
the
dependence
of
*NL*
having
others
present
when
they
met
was
Fanny
's
only
support
in
looking
*NL*
forward
to
it
.
She
absented
herself
as
little
as
possible
from
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
,
kept
away
from
the
East
room
,
and
took
no
solitary
walk
in
the
*NL*
shrubbery
,
in
her
caution
to
avoid
any
sudden
attack
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
succeeded
.
She
was
safe
in
the
breakfast-room
,
with
her
aunt
,
when
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
did
come
;
and
the
first
misery
over
,
and
Miss
Crawford
*NL*
looking
and
speaking
with
much
less
particularity
of
expression
than
she
*NL*
had
anticipated
,
Fanny
began
to
hope
there
would
be
nothing
worse
to
be
*NL*
endured
than
a
half-hour
of
moderate
agitation
.
But
here
she
hoped
too
*NL*
much
;
Miss
Crawford
was
not
the
slave
of
opportunity
.
She
was
determined
*NL*
to
see
Fanny
alone
,
and
therefore
said
to
her
tolerably
soon
,
in
a
low
*NL*
voice
,
``
I
must
speak
to
you
for
a
few
minutes
somewhere
''
;
words
that
*NL*
Fanny
felt
all
over
her
,
in
all
her
pulses
and
all
her
nerves
.
Denial
*NL*
was
impossible
.
Her
habits
of
ready
submission
,
on
the
contrary
,
made
*NL*
her
almost
instantly
rise
and
lead
the
way
out
of
the
room
.
She
did
it
*NL*
with
wretched
feelings
,
but
it
was
inevitable
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
no
sooner
in
the
hall
than
all
restraint
of
countenance
was
*NL*
over
on
Miss
Crawford
's
side
.
She
immediately
shook
her
head
at
Fanny
*NL*
with
arch
,
yet
affectionate
reproach
,
and
taking
her
hand
,
seemed
hardly
*NL*
able
to
help
beginning
directly
.
She
said
nothing
,
however
,
but
,
``
Sad
,
*NL*
sad
girl
!
I
do
not
know
when
I
shall
have
done
scolding
you
,
''
and
had
*NL*
discretion
enough
to
reserve
the
rest
till
they
might
be
secure
of
*NL*
having
four
walls
to
themselves
.
Fanny
naturally
turned
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
took
her
guest
to
the
apartment
which
was
now
always
fit
for
comfortable
*NL*
use
;
opening
the
door
,
however
,
with
a
most
aching
heart
,
and
feeling
*NL*
that
she
had
a
more
distressing
scene
before
her
than
ever
that
spot
had
*NL*
yet
witnessed
.
But
the
evil
ready
to
burst
on
her
was
at
least
delayed
*NL*
by
the
sudden
change
in
Miss
Crawford
's
ideas
;
by
the
strong
effect
on
*NL*
her
mind
which
the
finding
herself
in
the
East
room
again
produced
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
she
cried
,
with
instant
animation
,
``
am
I
here
again
?
The
East
*NL*
room
!
Once
only
was
I
in
this
room
before
''
;
and
after
stopping
to
look
*NL*
about
her
,
and
seemingly
to
retrace
all
that
had
then
passed
,
she
added
,
*NL*
``
Once
only
before
.
Do
you
remember
it
?
I
came
to
rehearse
.
Your
cousin
*NL*
came
too
;
and
we
had
a
rehearsal
.
You
were
our
audience
and
prompter
.
*NL*
A
delightful
rehearsal
.
I
shall
never
forget
it
.
Here
we
were
,
just
in
*NL*
this
part
of
the
room
:
here
was
your
cousin
,
here
was
I
,
here
were
the
*NL*
chairs
.
Oh
!
why
will
such
things
ever
pass
away
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
Happily
for
her
companion
,
she
wanted
no
answer
.
Her
mind
was
entirely
*NL*
self-engrossed
.
She
was
in
a
reverie
of
sweet
remembrances
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
The
scene
we
were
rehearsing
was
so
very
remarkable
!
The
subject
of
*NL*
it
so
very
--
very
--
what
shall
I
say
?
He
was
to
be
describing
and
*NL*
recommending
matrimony
to
me
.
I
think
I
see
him
now
,
trying
to
be
as
*NL*
demure
and
composed
as
Anhalt
ought
,
through
the
two
long
speeches
.
*NL*
`
When
two
sympathetic
hearts
meet
in
the
marriage
state
,
matrimony
*NL*
may
be
called
a
happy
life
.
'
I
suppose
no
time
can
ever
wear
out
the
*NL*
impression
I
have
of
his
looks
and
voice
as
he
said
those
words
.
It
was
*NL*
curious
,
very
curious
,
that
we
should
have
such
a
scene
to
play
!
If
I
*NL*
had
the
power
of
recalling
any
one
week
of
my
existence
,
it
should
be
*NL*
that
week
--
that
acting
week
.
Say
what
you
would
,
Fanny
,
it
should
be
*NL*
_
that
_
;
for
I
never
knew
such
exquisite
happiness
in
any
other
.
His
*NL*
sturdy
spirit
to
bend
as
it
did
!
Oh
!
it
was
sweet
beyond
expression
.
But
*NL*
alas
,
that
very
evening
destroyed
it
all
.
That
very
evening
brought
your
*NL*
most
unwelcome
uncle
.
Poor
Sir
Thomas
,
who
was
glad
to
see
you
?
Yet
,
*NL*
Fanny
,
do
not
imagine
I
would
now
speak
disrespectfully
of
Sir
Thomas
,
*NL*
though
I
certainly
did
hate
him
for
many
a
week
.
No
,
I
do
him
justice
*NL*
now
.
He
is
just
what
the
head
of
such
a
family
should
be
.
Nay
,
in
sober
*NL*
sadness
,
I
believe
I
now
love
you
all
.
''
And
having
said
so
,
with
a
*NL*
degree
of
tenderness
and
consciousness
which
Fanny
had
never
seen
in
her
*NL*
before
,
and
now
thought
only
too
becoming
,
she
turned
away
for
a
moment
*NL*
to
recover
herself
.
``
I
have
had
a
little
fit
since
I
came
into
this
*NL*
room
,
as
you
may
perceive
,
''
said
she
presently
,
with
a
playful
smile
,
*NL*
``
but
it
is
over
now
;
so
let
us
sit
down
and
be
comfortable
;
for
as
to
*NL*
scolding
you
,
Fanny
,
which
I
came
fully
intending
to
do
,
I
have
not
*NL*
the
heart
for
it
when
it
comes
to
the
point
.
''
And
embracing
her
very
*NL*
affectionately
,
``
Good
,
gentle
Fanny
!
when
I
think
of
this
being
the
*NL*
last
time
of
seeing
you
for
I
do
not
know
how
long
,
I
feel
it
quite
*NL*
impossible
to
do
anything
but
love
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
affected
.
She
had
not
foreseen
anything
of
this
,
and
her
*NL*
feelings
could
seldom
withstand
the
melancholy
influence
of
the
word
*NL*
``
last
.
''
She
cried
as
if
she
had
loved
Miss
Crawford
more
than
she
*NL*
possibly
could
;
and
Miss
Crawford
,
yet
farther
softened
by
the
sight
of
*NL*
such
emotion
,
hung
about
her
with
fondness
,
and
said
,
``
I
hate
to
leave
*NL*
you
.
I
shall
see
no
one
half
so
amiable
where
I
am
going
.
Who
says
we
*NL*
shall
not
be
sisters
?
I
know
we
shall
.
I
feel
that
we
are
born
to
*NL*
be
connected
;
and
those
tears
convince
me
that
you
feel
it
too
,
dear
*NL*
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
roused
herself
,
and
replying
only
in
part
,
said
,
``
But
you
are
*NL*
only
going
from
one
set
of
friends
to
another
.
You
are
going
to
a
very
*NL*
particular
friend
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
very
true
.
Mrs.
Fraser
has
been
my
intimate
friend
for
years
.
But
*NL*
I
have
not
the
least
inclination
to
go
near
her
.
I
can
think
only
of
the
*NL*
friends
I
am
leaving
:
my
excellent
sister
,
yourself
,
and
the
Bertrams
in
*NL*
general
.
You
have
all
so
much
more
_
heart
_
among
you
than
one
finds
in
*NL*
the
world
at
large
.
You
all
give
me
a
feeling
of
being
able
to
trust
and
*NL*
confide
in
you
,
which
in
common
intercourse
one
knows
nothing
of
.
I
wish
*NL*
I
had
settled
with
Mrs.
Fraser
not
to
go
to
her
till
after
Easter
,
a
*NL*
much
better
time
for
the
visit
,
but
now
I
can
not
put
her
off
.
And
when
*NL*
I
have
done
with
her
I
must
go
to
her
sister
,
Lady
Stornaway
,
because
*NL*
_
she
_
was
rather
my
most
particular
friend
of
the
two
,
but
I
have
not
*NL*
cared
much
for
_
her
_
these
three
years
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
this
speech
the
two
girls
sat
many
minutes
silent
,
each
*NL*
thoughtful
:
Fanny
meditating
on
the
different
sorts
of
friendship
in
the
*NL*
world
,
Mary
on
something
of
less
philosophic
tendency
.
_
She
_
first
spoke
*NL*
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
perfectly
I
remember
my
resolving
to
look
for
you
upstairs
,
and
*NL*
setting
off
to
find
my
way
to
the
East
room
,
without
having
an
idea
*NL*
whereabouts
it
was
!
How
well
I
remember
what
I
was
thinking
of
as
I
came
*NL*
along
,
and
my
looking
in
and
seeing
you
here
sitting
at
this
table
at
*NL*
work
;
and
then
your
cousin
's
astonishment
,
when
he
opened
the
door
,
at
*NL*
seeing
me
here
!
To
be
sure
,
your
uncle
's
returning
that
very
evening
!
*NL*
There
never
was
anything
quite
like
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Another
short
fit
of
abstraction
followed
,
when
,
shaking
it
off
,
she
*NL*
thus
attacked
her
companion
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Why
,
Fanny
,
you
are
absolutely
in
a
reverie
.
Thinking
,
I
hope
,
of
one
*NL*
who
is
always
thinking
of
you
.
Oh
!
that
I
could
transport
you
for
a
*NL*
short
time
into
our
circle
in
town
,
that
you
might
understand
how
your
*NL*
power
over
Henry
is
thought
of
there
!
Oh
!
the
envyings
and
heartburnings
*NL*
of
dozens
and
dozens
;
the
wonder
,
the
incredulity
that
will
be
felt
at
*NL*
hearing
what
you
have
done
!
For
as
to
secrecy
,
Henry
is
quite
the
hero
*NL*
of
an
old
romance
,
and
glories
in
his
chains
.
You
should
come
to
London
*NL*
to
know
how
to
estimate
your
conquest
.
If
you
were
to
see
how
he
is
*NL*
courted
,
and
how
I
am
courted
for
his
sake
!
Now
,
I
am
well
aware
that
*NL*
I
shall
not
be
half
so
welcome
to
Mrs.
Fraser
in
consequence
of
his
*NL*
situation
with
you
.
When
she
comes
to
know
the
truth
she
will
,
very
*NL*
likely
,
wish
me
in
Northamptonshire
again
;
for
there
is
a
daughter
of
*NL*
Mr.
Fraser
,
by
a
first
wife
,
whom
she
is
wild
to
get
married
,
and
*NL*
wants
Henry
to
take
.
Oh
!
she
has
been
trying
for
him
to
such
a
degree
.
*NL*
Innocent
and
quiet
as
you
sit
here
,
you
can
not
have
an
idea
of
the
*NL*
_
sensation
_
that
you
will
be
occasioning
,
of
the
curiosity
there
will
*NL*
be
to
see
you
,
of
the
endless
questions
I
shall
have
to
answer
!
Poor
*NL*
Margaret
Fraser
will
be
at
me
for
ever
about
your
eyes
and
your
teeth
,
*NL*
and
how
you
do
your
hair
,
and
who
makes
your
shoes
.
I
wish
Margaret
were
*NL*
married
,
for
my
poor
friend
's
sake
,
for
I
look
upon
the
Frasers
to
be
*NL*
about
as
unhappy
as
most
other
married
people
.
And
yet
it
was
a
most
*NL*
desirable
match
for
Janet
at
the
time
.
We
were
all
delighted
.
She
could
*NL*
not
do
otherwise
than
accept
him
,
for
he
was
rich
,
and
she
had
nothing
;
*NL*
but
he
turns
out
ill-tempered
and
_
exigeant
_
,
and
wants
a
young
woman
,
*NL*
a
beautiful
young
woman
of
five-and-twenty
,
to
be
as
steady
as
himself
.
*NL*
And
my
friend
does
not
manage
him
well
;
she
does
not
seem
to
know
how
*NL*
to
make
the
best
of
it
.
There
is
a
spirit
of
irritation
which
,
to
say
*NL*
nothing
worse
,
is
certainly
very
ill-bred
.
In
their
house
I
shall
call
*NL*
to
mind
the
conjugal
manners
of
Mansfield
Parsonage
with
respect
.
Even
*NL*
Dr.
Grant
does
shew
a
thorough
confidence
in
my
sister
,
and
a
certain
*NL*
consideration
for
her
judgment
,
which
makes
one
feel
there
_
is
_
*NL*
attachment
;
but
of
that
I
shall
see
nothing
with
the
Frasers
.
I
shall
*NL*
be
at
Mansfield
for
ever
,
Fanny
.
My
own
sister
as
a
wife
,
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
Bertram
as
a
husband
,
are
my
standards
of
perfection
.
Poor
Janet
has
*NL*
been
sadly
taken
in
,
and
yet
there
was
nothing
improper
on
her
side
:
*NL*
she
did
not
run
into
the
match
inconsiderately
;
there
was
no
want
of
*NL*
foresight
.
She
took
three
days
to
consider
of
his
proposals
,
and
during
*NL*
those
three
days
asked
the
advice
of
everybody
connected
with
her
whose
*NL*
opinion
was
worth
having
,
and
especially
applied
to
my
late
dear
aunt
,
*NL*
whose
knowledge
of
the
world
made
her
judgment
very
generally
and
*NL*
deservedly
looked
up
to
by
all
the
young
people
of
her
acquaintance
,
and
*NL*
she
was
decidedly
in
favour
of
Mr.
Fraser
.
This
seems
as
if
nothing
were
*NL*
a
security
for
matrimonial
comfort
.
I
have
not
so
much
to
say
for
my
*NL*
friend
Flora
,
who
jilted
a
very
nice
young
man
in
the
Blues
for
the
sake
*NL*
of
that
horrid
Lord
Stornaway
,
who
has
about
as
much
sense
,
Fanny
,
as
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
,
but
much
worse-looking
,
and
with
a
blackguard
character
.
*NL*
I
_
had
_
my
doubts
at
the
time
about
her
being
right
,
for
he
has
not
even
*NL*
the
air
of
a
gentleman
,
and
now
I
am
sure
she
was
wrong
.
By
the
bye
,
*NL*
Flora
Ross
was
dying
for
Henry
the
first
winter
she
came
out
.
But
were
I
*NL*
to
attempt
to
tell
you
of
all
the
women
whom
I
have
known
to
be
in
love
*NL*
with
him
,
I
should
never
have
done
.
It
is
you
,
only
you
,
insensible
*NL*
Fanny
,
who
can
think
of
him
with
anything
like
indifference
.
But
are
you
*NL*
so
insensible
as
you
profess
yourself
?
No
,
no
,
I
see
you
are
not
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
,
indeed
,
so
deep
a
blush
over
Fanny
's
face
at
that
moment
as
*NL*
might
warrant
strong
suspicion
in
a
predisposed
mind
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Excellent
creature
!
I
will
not
tease
you
.
Everything
shall
take
its
*NL*
course
.
But
,
dear
Fanny
,
you
must
allow
that
you
were
not
so
absolutely
*NL*
unprepared
to
have
the
question
asked
as
your
cousin
fancies
.
It
is
not
*NL*
possible
but
that
you
must
have
had
some
thoughts
on
the
subject
,
some
*NL*
surmises
as
to
what
might
be
.
You
must
have
seen
that
he
was
trying
to
*NL*
please
you
by
every
attention
in
his
power
.
Was
not
he
devoted
to
you
*NL*
at
the
ball
?
And
then
before
the
ball
,
the
necklace
!
Oh
!
you
received
*NL*
it
just
as
it
was
meant
.
You
were
as
conscious
as
heart
could
desire
.
I
*NL*
remember
it
perfectly
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Do
you
mean
,
then
,
that
your
brother
knew
of
the
necklace
beforehand
?
*NL*
Oh
!
Miss
Crawford
,
_
that
_
was
not
fair
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Knew
of
it
!
It
was
his
own
doing
entirely
,
his
own
thought
.
I
am
*NL*
ashamed
to
say
that
it
had
never
entered
my
head
,
but
I
was
delighted
to
*NL*
act
on
his
proposal
for
both
your
sakes
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
will
not
say
,
''
replied
Fanny
,
``
that
I
was
not
half
afraid
at
the
time
*NL*
of
its
being
so
,
for
there
was
something
in
your
look
that
frightened
*NL*
me
,
but
not
at
first
;
I
was
as
unsuspicious
of
it
at
first
--
indeed
,
*NL*
indeed
I
was
.
It
is
as
true
as
that
I
sit
here
.
And
had
I
had
an
idea
*NL*
of
it
,
nothing
should
have
induced
me
to
accept
the
necklace
.
As
to
your
*NL*
brother
's
behaviour
,
certainly
I
was
sensible
of
a
particularity
:
I
had
*NL*
been
sensible
of
it
some
little
time
,
perhaps
two
or
three
weeks
;
but
*NL*
then
I
considered
it
as
meaning
nothing
:
I
put
it
down
as
simply
being
*NL*
his
way
,
and
was
as
far
from
supposing
as
from
wishing
him
to
have
any
*NL*
serious
thoughts
of
me
.
I
had
not
,
Miss
Crawford
,
been
an
inattentive
*NL*
observer
of
what
was
passing
between
him
and
some
part
of
this
family
in
*NL*
the
summer
and
autumn
.
I
was
quiet
,
but
I
was
not
blind
.
I
could
not
*NL*
but
see
that
Mr.
Crawford
allowed
himself
in
gallantries
which
did
mean
*NL*
nothing
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ah
!
I
can
not
deny
it
.
He
has
now
and
then
been
a
sad
flirt
,
and
*NL*
cared
very
little
for
the
havoc
he
might
be
making
in
young
ladies
'
*NL*
affections
.
I
have
often
scolded
him
for
it
,
but
it
is
his
only
fault
;
*NL*
and
there
is
this
to
be
said
,
that
very
few
young
ladies
have
any
*NL*
affections
worth
caring
for
.
And
then
,
Fanny
,
the
glory
of
fixing
one
*NL*
who
has
been
shot
at
by
so
many
;
of
having
it
in
one
's
power
to
pay
off
*NL*
the
debts
of
one
's
sex
!
Oh
!
I
am
sure
it
is
not
in
woman
's
nature
to
*NL*
refuse
such
a
triumph
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
shook
her
head
.
``
I
can
not
think
well
of
a
man
who
sports
with
any
*NL*
woman
's
feelings
;
and
there
may
often
be
a
great
deal
more
suffered
than
*NL*
a
stander-by
can
judge
of
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
defend
him
.
I
leave
him
entirely
to
your
mercy
,
and
when
he
*NL*
has
got
you
at
Everingham
,
I
do
not
care
how
much
you
lecture
him
.
But
*NL*
this
I
will
say
,
that
his
fault
,
the
liking
to
make
girls
a
little
*NL*
in
love
with
him
,
is
not
half
so
dangerous
to
a
wife
's
happiness
as
a
*NL*
tendency
to
fall
in
love
himself
,
which
he
has
never
been
addicted
to
.
*NL*
And
I
do
seriously
and
truly
believe
that
he
is
attached
to
you
in
a
way
*NL*
that
he
never
was
to
any
woman
before
;
that
he
loves
you
with
all
his
*NL*
heart
,
and
will
love
you
as
nearly
for
ever
as
possible
.
If
any
man
ever
*NL*
loved
a
woman
for
ever
,
I
think
Henry
will
do
as
much
for
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
avoid
a
faint
smile
,
but
had
nothing
to
say
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
can
not
imagine
Henry
ever
to
have
been
happier
,
''
continued
Mary
*NL*
presently
,
``
than
when
he
had
succeeded
in
getting
your
brother
's
*NL*
commission
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
made
a
sure
push
at
Fanny
's
feelings
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh
!
yes
.
How
very
,
very
kind
of
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
know
he
must
have
exerted
himself
very
much
,
for
I
know
the
parties
*NL*
he
had
to
move
.
The
Admiral
hates
trouble
,
and
scorns
asking
favours
;
*NL*
and
there
are
so
many
young
men
's
claims
to
be
attended
to
in
the
same
*NL*
way
,
that
a
friendship
and
energy
,
not
very
determined
,
is
easily
put
*NL*
by
.
What
a
happy
creature
William
must
be
!
I
wish
we
could
see
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Fanny
's
mind
was
thrown
into
the
most
distressing
of
all
its
*NL*
varieties
.
The
recollection
of
what
had
been
done
for
William
was
always
*NL*
the
most
powerful
disturber
of
every
decision
against
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
*NL*
she
sat
thinking
deeply
of
it
till
Mary
,
who
had
been
first
watching
*NL*
her
complacently
,
and
then
musing
on
something
else
,
suddenly
called
*NL*
her
attention
by
saying
:
``
I
should
like
to
sit
talking
with
you
here
all
*NL*
day
,
but
we
must
not
forget
the
ladies
below
,
and
so
good-bye
,
my
dear
,
*NL*
my
amiable
,
my
excellent
Fanny
,
for
though
we
shall
nominally
part
in
*NL*
the
breakfast-parlour
,
I
must
take
leave
of
you
here
.
And
I
do
take
*NL*
leave
,
longing
for
a
happy
reunion
,
and
trusting
that
when
we
meet
*NL*
again
,
it
will
be
under
circumstances
which
may
open
our
hearts
to
each
*NL*
other
without
any
remnant
or
shadow
of
reserve
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
,
very
kind
embrace
,
and
some
agitation
of
manner
,
accompanied
*NL*
these
words
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
shall
see
your
cousin
in
town
soon
:
he
talks
of
being
there
tolerably
*NL*
soon
;
and
Sir
Thomas
,
I
dare
say
,
in
the
course
of
the
spring
;
and
your
*NL*
eldest
cousin
,
and
the
Rushworths
,
and
Julia
,
I
am
sure
of
meeting
again
*NL*
and
again
,
and
all
but
you
.
I
have
two
favours
to
ask
,
Fanny
:
one
is
*NL*
your
correspondence
.
You
must
write
to
me
.
And
the
other
,
that
you
will
*NL*
often
call
on
Mrs.
Grant
,
and
make
her
amends
for
my
being
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
,
at
least
,
of
these
favours
Fanny
would
rather
not
have
been
*NL*
asked
;
but
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
refuse
the
correspondence
;
it
*NL*
was
impossible
for
her
even
not
to
accede
to
it
more
readily
than
*NL*
her
own
judgment
authorised
.
There
was
no
resisting
so
much
apparent
*NL*
affection
.
Her
disposition
was
peculiarly
calculated
to
value
a
fond
*NL*
treatment
,
and
from
having
hitherto
known
so
little
of
it
,
she
was
the
*NL*
more
overcome
by
Miss
Crawford
's
.
Besides
,
there
was
gratitude
towards
*NL*
her
,
for
having
made
their
_
tete-a-tete
_
so
much
less
painful
than
her
*NL*
fears
had
predicted
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
over
,
and
she
had
escaped
without
reproaches
and
without
*NL*
detection
.
Her
secret
was
still
her
own
;
and
while
that
was
the
case
,
*NL*
she
thought
she
could
resign
herself
to
almost
everything
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
the
evening
there
was
another
parting
.
Henry
Crawford
came
and
*NL*
sat
some
time
with
them
;
and
her
spirits
not
being
previously
in
the
*NL*
strongest
state
,
her
heart
was
softened
for
a
while
towards
him
,
because
*NL*
he
really
seemed
to
feel
.
Quite
unlike
his
usual
self
,
he
scarcely
said
*NL*
anything
.
He
was
evidently
oppressed
,
and
Fanny
must
grieve
for
him
,
*NL*
though
hoping
she
might
never
see
him
again
till
he
were
the
husband
of
*NL*
some
other
woman
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
it
came
to
the
moment
of
parting
,
he
would
take
her
hand
,
he
would
*NL*
not
be
denied
it
;
he
said
nothing
,
however
,
or
nothing
that
she
heard
,
*NL*
and
when
he
had
left
the
room
,
she
was
better
pleased
that
such
a
token
*NL*
of
friendship
had
passed
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
the
morrow
the
Crawfords
were
gone
.

CHAPTER
XXXVII
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
gone
,
Sir
Thomas
's
next
object
was
that
he
should
be
*NL*
missed
;
and
he
entertained
great
hope
that
his
niece
would
find
a
blank
*NL*
in
the
loss
of
those
attentions
which
at
the
time
she
had
felt
,
or
*NL*
fancied
,
an
evil
.
She
had
tasted
of
consequence
in
its
most
flattering
*NL*
form
;
and
he
did
hope
that
the
loss
of
it
,
the
sinking
again
into
*NL*
nothing
,
would
awaken
very
wholesome
regrets
in
her
mind
.
He
watched
her
*NL*
with
this
idea
;
but
he
could
hardly
tell
with
what
success
.
He
hardly
*NL*
knew
whether
there
were
any
difference
in
her
spirits
or
not
.
She
*NL*
was
always
so
gentle
and
retiring
that
her
emotions
were
beyond
his
*NL*
discrimination
.
He
did
not
understand
her
:
he
felt
that
he
did
not
;
and
*NL*
therefore
applied
to
Edmund
to
tell
him
how
she
stood
affected
on
the
*NL*
present
occasion
,
and
whether
she
were
more
or
less
happy
than
she
had
*NL*
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
did
not
discern
any
symptoms
of
regret
,
and
thought
his
father
*NL*
a
little
unreasonable
in
supposing
the
first
three
or
four
days
could
*NL*
produce
any
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
chiefly
surprised
Edmund
was
,
that
Crawford
's
sister
,
the
friend
*NL*
and
companion
who
had
been
so
much
to
her
,
should
not
be
more
visibly
*NL*
regretted
.
He
wondered
that
Fanny
spoke
so
seldom
of
_
her
_
,
and
had
so
*NL*
little
voluntarily
to
say
of
her
concern
at
this
separation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Alas
!
it
was
this
sister
,
this
friend
and
companion
,
who
was
now
the
*NL*
chief
bane
of
Fanny
's
comfort
.
If
she
could
have
believed
Mary
's
future
*NL*
fate
as
unconnected
with
Mansfield
as
she
was
determined
the
brother
's
*NL*
should
be
,
if
she
could
have
hoped
her
return
thither
to
be
as
distant
*NL*
as
she
was
much
inclined
to
think
his
,
she
would
have
been
light
of
*NL*
heart
indeed
;
but
the
more
she
recollected
and
observed
,
the
more
deeply
*NL*
was
she
convinced
that
everything
was
now
in
a
fairer
train
for
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
marrying
Edmund
than
it
had
ever
been
before
.
On
his
side
the
*NL*
inclination
was
stronger
,
on
hers
less
equivocal
.
His
objections
,
the
*NL*
scruples
of
his
integrity
,
seemed
all
done
away
,
nobody
could
tell
*NL*
how
;
and
the
doubts
and
hesitations
of
her
ambition
were
equally
got
*NL*
over
--
and
equally
without
apparent
reason
.
It
could
only
be
imputed
to
*NL*
increasing
attachment
.
His
good
and
her
bad
feelings
yielded
to
love
,
*NL*
and
such
love
must
unite
them
.
He
was
to
go
to
town
as
soon
as
some
*NL*
business
relative
to
Thornton
Lacey
were
completed
--
perhaps
within
a
*NL*
fortnight
;
he
talked
of
going
,
he
loved
to
talk
of
it
;
and
when
once
*NL*
with
her
again
,
Fanny
could
not
doubt
the
rest
.
Her
acceptance
must
be
*NL*
as
certain
as
his
offer
;
and
yet
there
were
bad
feelings
still
remaining
*NL*
which
made
the
prospect
of
it
most
sorrowful
to
her
,
independently
,
she
*NL*
believed
,
independently
of
self
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
their
very
last
conversation
,
Miss
Crawford
,
in
spite
of
some
amiable
*NL*
sensations
,
and
much
personal
kindness
,
had
still
been
Miss
Crawford
;
*NL*
still
shewn
a
mind
led
astray
and
bewildered
,
and
without
any
suspicion
*NL*
of
being
so
;
darkened
,
yet
fancying
itself
light
.
She
might
love
,
but
*NL*
she
did
not
deserve
Edmund
by
any
other
sentiment
.
Fanny
believed
there
*NL*
was
scarcely
a
second
feeling
in
common
between
them
;
and
she
may
be
*NL*
forgiven
by
older
sages
for
looking
on
the
chance
of
Miss
Crawford
's
*NL*
future
improvement
as
nearly
desperate
,
for
thinking
that
if
Edmund
's
*NL*
influence
in
this
season
of
love
had
already
done
so
little
in
clearing
*NL*
her
judgment
,
and
regulating
her
notions
,
his
worth
would
be
finally
*NL*
wasted
on
her
even
in
years
of
matrimony
.
*NL*
*NL*
Experience
might
have
hoped
more
for
any
young
people
so
circumstanced
,
*NL*
and
impartiality
would
not
have
denied
to
Miss
Crawford
's
nature
that
*NL*
participation
of
the
general
nature
of
women
which
would
lead
her
to
*NL*
adopt
the
opinions
of
the
man
she
loved
and
respected
as
her
own
.
But
*NL*
as
such
were
Fanny
's
persuasions
,
she
suffered
very
much
from
them
,
and
*NL*
could
never
speak
of
Miss
Crawford
without
pain
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
meanwhile
,
went
on
with
his
own
hopes
and
his
own
*NL*
observations
,
still
feeling
a
right
,
by
all
his
knowledge
of
human
*NL*
nature
,
to
expect
to
see
the
effect
of
the
loss
of
power
and
consequence
*NL*
on
his
niece
's
spirits
,
and
the
past
attentions
of
the
lover
producing
a
*NL*
craving
for
their
return
;
and
he
was
soon
afterwards
able
to
account
for
*NL*
his
not
yet
completely
and
indubitably
seeing
all
this
,
by
the
prospect
*NL*
of
another
visitor
,
whose
approach
he
could
allow
to
be
quite
enough
to
*NL*
support
the
spirits
he
was
watching
.
William
had
obtained
a
ten
days
'
*NL*
leave
of
absence
,
to
be
given
to
Northamptonshire
,
and
was
coming
,
the
*NL*
happiest
of
lieutenants
,
because
the
latest
made
,
to
shew
his
happiness
*NL*
and
describe
his
uniform
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
came
;
and
he
would
have
been
delighted
to
shew
his
uniform
there
too
,
*NL*
had
not
cruel
custom
prohibited
its
appearance
except
on
duty
.
So
the
*NL*
uniform
remained
at
Portsmouth
,
and
Edmund
conjectured
that
before
Fanny
*NL*
had
any
chance
of
seeing
it
,
all
its
own
freshness
and
all
the
freshness
*NL*
of
its
wearer
's
feelings
must
be
worn
away
.
It
would
be
sunk
into
a
*NL*
badge
of
disgrace
;
for
what
can
be
more
unbecoming
,
or
more
worthless
,
*NL*
than
the
uniform
of
a
lieutenant
,
who
has
been
a
lieutenant
a
year
or
*NL*
two
,
and
sees
others
made
commanders
before
him
?
So
reasoned
Edmund
,
*NL*
till
his
father
made
him
the
confidant
of
a
scheme
which
placed
Fanny
's
*NL*
chance
of
seeing
the
second
lieutenant
of
H.M.S.
Thrush
in
all
his
glory
*NL*
in
another
light
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
scheme
was
that
she
should
accompany
her
brother
back
to
*NL*
Portsmouth
,
and
spend
a
little
time
with
her
own
family
.
It
had
occurred
*NL*
to
Sir
Thomas
,
in
one
of
his
dignified
musings
,
as
a
right
and
desirable
*NL*
measure
;
but
before
he
absolutely
made
up
his
mind
,
he
consulted
his
*NL*
son
.
Edmund
considered
it
every
way
,
and
saw
nothing
but
what
was
right
.
*NL*
The
thing
was
good
in
itself
,
and
could
not
be
done
at
a
better
time
;
*NL*
and
he
had
no
doubt
of
it
being
highly
agreeable
to
Fanny
.
This
was
*NL*
enough
to
determine
Sir
Thomas
;
and
a
decisive
``
then
so
it
shall
be
''
*NL*
closed
that
stage
of
the
business
;
Sir
Thomas
retiring
from
it
with
some
*NL*
feelings
of
satisfaction
,
and
views
of
good
over
and
above
what
he
had
*NL*
communicated
to
his
son
;
for
his
prime
motive
in
sending
her
away
had
*NL*
very
little
to
do
with
the
propriety
of
her
seeing
her
parents
again
,
*NL*
and
nothing
at
all
with
any
idea
of
making
her
happy
.
He
certainly
*NL*
wished
her
to
go
willingly
,
but
he
as
certainly
wished
her
to
be
*NL*
heartily
sick
of
home
before
her
visit
ended
;
and
that
a
little
*NL*
abstinence
from
the
elegancies
and
luxuries
of
Mansfield
Park
would
*NL*
bring
her
mind
into
a
sober
state
,
and
incline
her
to
a
juster
estimate
*NL*
of
the
value
of
that
home
of
greater
permanence
,
and
equal
comfort
,
of
*NL*
which
she
had
the
offer
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
medicinal
project
upon
his
niece
's
understanding
,
which
he
must
*NL*
consider
as
at
present
diseased
.
A
residence
of
eight
or
nine
years
in
*NL*
the
abode
of
wealth
and
plenty
had
a
little
disordered
her
powers
of
*NL*
comparing
and
judging
.
Her
father
's
house
would
,
in
all
probability
,
*NL*
teach
her
the
value
of
a
good
income
;
and
he
trusted
that
she
would
be
*NL*
the
wiser
and
happier
woman
,
all
her
life
,
for
the
experiment
he
had
*NL*
devised
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
Fanny
been
at
all
addicted
to
raptures
,
she
must
have
had
a
strong
*NL*
attack
of
them
when
she
first
understood
what
was
intended
,
when
her
*NL*
uncle
first
made
her
the
offer
of
visiting
the
parents
,
and
brothers
,
*NL*
and
sisters
,
from
whom
she
had
been
divided
almost
half
her
life
;
of
*NL*
returning
for
a
couple
of
months
to
the
scenes
of
her
infancy
,
with
*NL*
William
for
the
protector
and
companion
of
her
journey
,
and
the
*NL*
certainty
of
continuing
to
see
William
to
the
last
hour
of
his
remaining
*NL*
on
land
.
Had
she
ever
given
way
to
bursts
of
delight
,
it
must
have
been
*NL*
then
,
for
she
was
delighted
,
but
her
happiness
was
of
a
quiet
,
deep
,
*NL*
heart-swelling
sort
;
and
though
never
a
great
talker
,
she
was
always
*NL*
more
inclined
to
silence
when
feeling
most
strongly
.
At
the
moment
she
*NL*
could
only
thank
and
accept
.
Afterwards
,
when
familiarised
with
the
*NL*
visions
of
enjoyment
so
suddenly
opened
,
she
could
speak
more
largely
*NL*
to
William
and
Edmund
of
what
she
felt
;
but
still
there
were
emotions
*NL*
of
tenderness
that
could
not
be
clothed
in
words
.
The
remembrance
of
all
*NL*
her
earliest
pleasures
,
and
of
what
she
had
suffered
in
being
torn
from
*NL*
them
,
came
over
her
with
renewed
strength
,
and
it
seemed
as
if
to
be
*NL*
at
home
again
would
heal
every
pain
that
had
since
grown
out
of
the
*NL*
separation
.
To
be
in
the
centre
of
such
a
circle
,
loved
by
so
many
,
*NL*
and
more
loved
by
all
than
she
had
ever
been
before
;
to
feel
affection
*NL*
without
fear
or
restraint
;
to
feel
herself
the
equal
of
those
who
*NL*
surrounded
her
;
to
be
at
peace
from
all
mention
of
the
Crawfords
,
safe
*NL*
from
every
look
which
could
be
fancied
a
reproach
on
their
account
.
This
*NL*
was
a
prospect
to
be
dwelt
on
with
a
fondness
that
could
be
but
half
*NL*
acknowledged
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
,
too
--
to
be
two
months
from
_
him
_
-LRB-
and
perhaps
she
might
be
*NL*
allowed
to
make
her
absence
three
-RRB-
must
do
her
good
.
At
a
distance
,
*NL*
unassailed
by
his
looks
or
his
kindness
,
and
safe
from
the
perpetual
*NL*
irritation
of
knowing
his
heart
,
and
striving
to
avoid
his
confidence
,
*NL*
she
should
be
able
to
reason
herself
into
a
properer
state
;
she
should
*NL*
be
able
to
think
of
him
as
in
London
,
and
arranging
everything
there
,
*NL*
without
wretchedness
.
What
might
have
been
hard
to
bear
at
Mansfield
was
*NL*
to
become
a
slight
evil
at
Portsmouth
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
drawback
was
the
doubt
of
her
aunt
Bertram
's
being
comfortable
*NL*
without
her
.
She
was
of
use
to
no
one
else
;
but
_
there
_
she
might
be
*NL*
missed
to
a
degree
that
she
did
not
like
to
think
of
;
and
that
part
of
*NL*
the
arrangement
was
,
indeed
,
the
hardest
for
Sir
Thomas
to
accomplish
,
*NL*
and
what
only
_
he
_
could
have
accomplished
at
all
.
*NL*
*NL*
But
he
was
master
at
Mansfield
Park
.
When
he
had
really
resolved
on
*NL*
any
measure
,
he
could
always
carry
it
through
;
and
now
by
dint
of
long
*NL*
talking
on
the
subject
,
explaining
and
dwelling
on
the
duty
of
Fanny
's
*NL*
sometimes
seeing
her
family
,
he
did
induce
his
wife
to
let
her
go
;
*NL*
obtaining
it
rather
from
submission
,
however
,
than
conviction
,
for
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
was
convinced
of
very
little
more
than
that
Sir
Thomas
thought
*NL*
Fanny
ought
to
go
,
and
therefore
that
she
must
.
In
the
calmness
of
*NL*
her
own
dressing-room
,
in
the
impartial
flow
of
her
own
meditations
,
*NL*
unbiassed
by
his
bewildering
statements
,
she
could
not
acknowledge
any
*NL*
necessity
for
Fanny
's
ever
going
near
a
father
and
mother
who
had
done
*NL*
without
her
so
long
,
while
she
was
so
useful
to
herself
.
And
as
to
the
*NL*
not
missing
her
,
which
under
Mrs.
Norris
's
discussion
was
the
point
*NL*
attempted
to
be
proved
,
she
set
herself
very
steadily
against
admitting
*NL*
any
such
thing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
had
appealed
to
her
reason
,
conscience
,
and
dignity
.
He
*NL*
called
it
a
sacrifice
,
and
demanded
it
of
her
goodness
and
self-command
*NL*
as
such
.
But
Mrs.
Norris
wanted
to
persuade
her
that
Fanny
could
be
very
*NL*
well
spared
--
_
she
_
being
ready
to
give
up
all
her
own
time
to
her
as
*NL*
requested
--
and
,
in
short
,
could
not
really
be
wanted
or
missed
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
That
may
be
,
sister
,
''
was
all
Lady
Bertram
's
reply
.
``
I
dare
say
you
are
*NL*
very
right
;
but
I
am
sure
I
shall
miss
her
very
much
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
step
was
to
communicate
with
Portsmouth
.
Fanny
wrote
to
offer
*NL*
herself
;
and
her
mother
's
answer
,
though
short
,
was
so
kind
--
a
few
*NL*
simple
lines
expressed
so
natural
and
motherly
a
joy
in
the
prospect
*NL*
of
seeing
her
child
again
,
as
to
confirm
all
the
daughter
's
views
of
*NL*
happiness
in
being
with
her
--
convincing
her
that
she
should
now
find
a
*NL*
warm
and
affectionate
friend
in
the
``
mama
''
who
had
certainly
shewn
no
*NL*
remarkable
fondness
for
her
formerly
;
but
this
she
could
easily
suppose
*NL*
to
have
been
her
own
fault
or
her
own
fancy
.
She
had
probably
alienated
*NL*
love
by
the
helplessness
and
fretfulness
of
a
fearful
temper
,
or
been
*NL*
unreasonable
in
wanting
a
larger
share
than
any
one
among
so
many
could
*NL*
deserve
.
Now
,
when
she
knew
better
how
to
be
useful
,
and
how
to
forbear
,
*NL*
and
when
her
mother
could
be
no
longer
occupied
by
the
incessant
*NL*
demands
of
a
house
full
of
little
children
,
there
would
be
leisure
and
*NL*
inclination
for
every
comfort
,
and
they
should
soon
be
what
mother
and
*NL*
daughter
ought
to
be
to
each
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
almost
as
happy
in
the
plan
as
his
sister
.
It
would
be
the
*NL*
greatest
pleasure
to
him
to
have
her
there
to
the
last
moment
before
he
*NL*
sailed
,
and
perhaps
find
her
there
still
when
he
came
in
from
his
first
*NL*
cruise
.
And
besides
,
he
wanted
her
so
very
much
to
see
the
Thrush
before
*NL*
she
went
out
of
harbour
--
the
Thrush
was
certainly
the
finest
sloop
in
*NL*
the
service
--
and
there
were
several
improvements
in
the
dockyard
,
too
,
*NL*
which
he
quite
longed
to
shew
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
did
not
scruple
to
add
that
her
being
at
home
for
a
while
would
be
a
*NL*
great
advantage
to
everybody
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
how
it
is
,
''
said
he
;
``
but
we
seem
to
want
some
of
*NL*
your
nice
ways
and
orderliness
at
my
father
's
.
The
house
is
always
in
*NL*
confusion
.
You
will
set
things
going
in
a
better
way
,
I
am
sure
.
You
*NL*
will
tell
my
mother
how
it
all
ought
to
be
,
and
you
will
be
so
useful
to
*NL*
Susan
,
and
you
will
teach
Betsey
,
and
make
the
boys
love
and
mind
you
.
*NL*
How
right
and
comfortable
it
will
all
be
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
Mrs.
Price
's
answer
arrived
,
there
remained
but
a
very
few
*NL*
days
more
to
be
spent
at
Mansfield
;
and
for
part
of
one
of
those
days
*NL*
the
young
travellers
were
in
a
good
deal
of
alarm
on
the
subject
of
*NL*
their
journey
,
for
when
the
mode
of
it
came
to
be
talked
of
,
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
found
that
all
her
anxiety
to
save
her
brother-in-law
's
money
*NL*
was
vain
,
and
that
in
spite
of
her
wishes
and
hints
for
a
less
expensive
*NL*
conveyance
of
Fanny
,
they
were
to
travel
post
;
when
she
saw
Sir
Thomas
*NL*
actually
give
William
notes
for
the
purpose
,
she
was
struck
with
the
*NL*
idea
of
there
being
room
for
a
third
in
the
carriage
,
and
suddenly
*NL*
seized
with
a
strong
inclination
to
go
with
them
,
to
go
and
see
her
poor
*NL*
dear
sister
Price
.
She
proclaimed
her
thoughts
.
She
must
say
that
she
*NL*
had
more
than
half
a
mind
to
go
with
the
young
people
;
it
would
be
such
*NL*
an
indulgence
to
her
;
she
had
not
seen
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
for
*NL*
more
than
twenty
years
;
and
it
would
be
a
help
to
the
young
people
in
*NL*
their
journey
to
have
her
older
head
to
manage
for
them
;
and
she
could
*NL*
not
help
thinking
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
would
feel
it
very
unkind
*NL*
of
her
not
to
come
by
such
an
opportunity
.
*NL*
*NL*
William
and
Fanny
were
horror-struck
at
the
idea
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
the
comfort
of
their
comfortable
journey
would
be
destroyed
at
*NL*
once
.
With
woeful
countenances
they
looked
at
each
other
.
Their
suspense
*NL*
lasted
an
hour
or
two
.
No
one
interfered
to
encourage
or
dissuade
.
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
was
left
to
settle
the
matter
by
herself
;
and
it
ended
,
to
the
*NL*
infinite
joy
of
her
nephew
and
niece
,
in
the
recollection
that
she
could
*NL*
not
possibly
be
spared
from
Mansfield
Park
at
present
;
that
she
was
a
*NL*
great
deal
too
necessary
to
Sir
Thomas
and
Lady
Bertram
for
her
to
*NL*
be
able
to
answer
it
to
herself
to
leave
them
even
for
a
week
,
and
*NL*
therefore
must
certainly
sacrifice
every
other
pleasure
to
that
of
being
*NL*
useful
to
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
,
in
fact
,
occurred
to
her
,
that
though
taken
to
Portsmouth
for
*NL*
nothing
,
it
would
be
hardly
possible
for
her
to
avoid
paying
her
own
*NL*
expenses
back
again
.
So
her
poor
dear
sister
Price
was
left
to
all
the
*NL*
disappointment
of
her
missing
such
an
opportunity
,
and
another
twenty
*NL*
years
'
absence
,
perhaps
,
begun
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
's
plans
were
affected
by
this
Portsmouth
journey
,
this
absence
of
*NL*
Fanny
's
.
He
too
had
a
sacrifice
to
make
to
Mansfield
Park
as
well
as
his
*NL*
aunt
.
He
had
intended
,
about
this
time
,
to
be
going
to
London
;
but
he
*NL*
could
not
leave
his
father
and
mother
just
when
everybody
else
of
most
*NL*
importance
to
their
comfort
was
leaving
them
;
and
with
an
effort
,
felt
*NL*
but
not
boasted
of
,
he
delayed
for
a
week
or
two
longer
a
journey
which
*NL*
he
was
looking
forward
to
with
the
hope
of
its
fixing
his
happiness
for
*NL*
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
told
Fanny
of
it
.
She
knew
so
much
already
,
that
she
must
know
*NL*
everything
.
It
made
the
substance
of
one
other
confidential
discourse
*NL*
about
Miss
Crawford
;
and
Fanny
was
the
more
affected
from
feeling
it
to
*NL*
be
the
last
time
in
which
Miss
Crawford
's
name
would
ever
be
mentioned
*NL*
between
them
with
any
remains
of
liberty
.
Once
afterwards
she
was
*NL*
alluded
to
by
him
.
Lady
Bertram
had
been
telling
her
niece
in
the
*NL*
evening
to
write
to
her
soon
and
often
,
and
promising
to
be
a
good
*NL*
correspondent
herself
;
and
Edmund
,
at
a
convenient
moment
,
then
added
*NL*
in
a
whisper
,
``
And
_
I
_
shall
write
to
you
,
Fanny
,
when
I
have
anything
*NL*
worth
writing
about
,
anything
to
say
that
I
think
you
will
like
to
hear
,
*NL*
and
that
you
will
not
hear
so
soon
from
any
other
quarter
.
''
Had
she
*NL*
doubted
his
meaning
while
she
listened
,
the
glow
in
his
face
,
when
she
*NL*
looked
up
at
him
,
would
have
been
decisive
.
*NL*
*NL*
For
this
letter
she
must
try
to
arm
herself
.
That
a
letter
from
Edmund
*NL*
should
be
a
subject
of
terror
!
She
began
to
feel
that
she
had
not
yet
*NL*
gone
through
all
the
changes
of
opinion
and
sentiment
which
the
progress
*NL*
of
time
and
variation
of
circumstances
occasion
in
this
world
of
*NL*
changes
.
The
vicissitudes
of
the
human
mind
had
not
yet
been
exhausted
*NL*
by
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Fanny
!
though
going
as
she
did
willingly
and
eagerly
,
the
last
*NL*
evening
at
Mansfield
Park
must
still
be
wretchedness
.
Her
heart
was
*NL*
completely
sad
at
parting
.
She
had
tears
for
every
room
in
the
house
,
*NL*
much
more
for
every
beloved
inhabitant
.
She
clung
to
her
aunt
,
because
*NL*
she
would
miss
her
;
she
kissed
the
hand
of
her
uncle
with
struggling
*NL*
sobs
,
because
she
had
displeased
him
;
and
as
for
Edmund
,
she
could
*NL*
neither
speak
,
nor
look
,
nor
think
,
when
the
last
moment
came
with
*NL*
_
him
_
;
and
it
was
not
till
it
was
over
that
she
knew
he
was
giving
her
*NL*
the
affectionate
farewell
of
a
brother
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
passed
overnight
,
for
the
journey
was
to
begin
very
early
in
*NL*
the
morning
;
and
when
the
small
,
diminished
party
met
at
breakfast
,
*NL*
William
and
Fanny
were
talked
of
as
already
advanced
one
stage
.

*NL*
CHAPTER
XXXVIII
*NL*
*NL*
The
novelty
of
travelling
,
and
the
happiness
of
being
with
William
,
soon
*NL*
produced
their
natural
effect
on
Fanny
's
spirits
,
when
Mansfield
Park
*NL*
was
fairly
left
behind
;
and
by
the
time
their
first
stage
was
ended
,
and
*NL*
they
were
to
quit
Sir
Thomas
's
carriage
,
she
was
able
to
take
leave
of
*NL*
the
old
coachman
,
and
send
back
proper
messages
,
with
cheerful
looks
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
pleasant
talk
between
the
brother
and
sister
there
was
no
end
.
*NL*
Everything
supplied
an
amusement
to
the
high
glee
of
William
's
mind
,
and
*NL*
he
was
full
of
frolic
and
joke
in
the
intervals
of
their
higher-toned
*NL*
subjects
,
all
of
which
ended
,
if
they
did
not
begin
,
in
praise
of
the
*NL*
Thrush
,
conjectures
how
she
would
be
employed
,
schemes
for
an
action
*NL*
with
some
superior
force
,
which
-LRB-
supposing
the
first
lieutenant
out
of
*NL*
the
way
,
and
William
was
not
very
merciful
to
the
first
lieutenant
-RRB-
was
*NL*
to
give
himself
the
next
step
as
soon
as
possible
,
or
speculations
upon
*NL*
prize-money
,
which
was
to
be
generously
distributed
at
home
,
with
only
*NL*
the
reservation
of
enough
to
make
the
little
cottage
comfortable
,
*NL*
in
which
he
and
Fanny
were
to
pass
all
their
middle
and
later
life
*NL*
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
immediate
concerns
,
as
far
as
they
involved
Mr.
Crawford
,
made
*NL*
no
part
of
their
conversation
.
William
knew
what
had
passed
,
and
from
*NL*
his
heart
lamented
that
his
sister
's
feelings
should
be
so
cold
towards
*NL*
a
man
whom
he
must
consider
as
the
first
of
human
characters
;
but
he
was
*NL*
of
an
age
to
be
all
for
love
,
and
therefore
unable
to
blame
;
and
knowing
*NL*
her
wish
on
the
subject
,
he
would
not
distress
her
by
the
slightest
*NL*
allusion
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
reason
to
suppose
herself
not
yet
forgotten
by
Mr.
Crawford
.
She
*NL*
had
heard
repeatedly
from
his
sister
within
the
three
weeks
which
had
*NL*
passed
since
their
leaving
Mansfield
,
and
in
each
letter
there
had
been
*NL*
a
few
lines
from
himself
,
warm
and
determined
like
his
speeches
.
It
*NL*
was
a
correspondence
which
Fanny
found
quite
as
unpleasant
as
she
had
*NL*
feared
.
Miss
Crawford
's
style
of
writing
,
lively
and
affectionate
,
was
*NL*
itself
an
evil
,
independent
of
what
she
was
thus
forced
into
reading
*NL*
from
the
brother
's
pen
,
for
Edmund
would
never
rest
till
she
had
read
*NL*
the
chief
of
the
letter
to
him
;
and
then
she
had
to
listen
to
his
*NL*
admiration
of
her
language
,
and
the
warmth
of
her
attachments
.
There
*NL*
had
,
in
fact
,
been
so
much
of
message
,
of
allusion
,
of
recollection
,
so
*NL*
much
of
Mansfield
in
every
letter
,
that
Fanny
could
not
but
suppose
it
*NL*
meant
for
him
to
hear
;
and
to
find
herself
forced
into
a
purpose
of
*NL*
that
kind
,
compelled
into
a
correspondence
which
was
bringing
her
the
*NL*
addresses
of
the
man
she
did
not
love
,
and
obliging
her
to
administer
*NL*
to
the
adverse
passion
of
the
man
she
did
,
was
cruelly
mortifying
.
Here
,
*NL*
too
,
her
present
removal
promised
advantage
.
When
no
longer
under
the
*NL*
same
roof
with
Edmund
,
she
trusted
that
Miss
Crawford
would
have
no
*NL*
motive
for
writing
strong
enough
to
overcome
the
trouble
,
and
that
at
*NL*
Portsmouth
their
correspondence
would
dwindle
into
nothing
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
thoughts
as
these
,
among
ten
hundred
others
,
Fanny
proceeded
*NL*
in
her
journey
safely
and
cheerfully
,
and
as
expeditiously
as
could
*NL*
rationally
be
hoped
in
the
dirty
month
of
February
.
They
entered
Oxford
,
*NL*
but
she
could
take
only
a
hasty
glimpse
of
Edmund
's
college
as
they
*NL*
passed
along
,
and
made
no
stop
anywhere
till
they
reached
Newbury
,
where
*NL*
a
comfortable
meal
,
uniting
dinner
and
supper
,
wound
up
the
enjoyments
*NL*
and
fatigues
of
the
day
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
morning
saw
them
off
again
at
an
early
hour
;
and
with
no
*NL*
events
,
and
no
delays
,
they
regularly
advanced
,
and
were
in
the
environs
*NL*
of
Portsmouth
while
there
was
yet
daylight
for
Fanny
to
look
around
her
,
*NL*
and
wonder
at
the
new
buildings
.
They
passed
the
drawbridge
,
and
*NL*
entered
the
town
;
and
the
light
was
only
beginning
to
fail
as
,
guided
*NL*
by
William
's
powerful
voice
,
they
were
rattled
into
a
narrow
street
,
*NL*
leading
from
the
High
Street
,
and
drawn
up
before
the
door
of
a
small
*NL*
house
now
inhabited
by
Mr.
Price
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
all
agitation
and
flutter
;
all
hope
and
apprehension
.
The
*NL*
moment
they
stopped
,
a
trollopy-looking
maidservant
,
seemingly
in
*NL*
waiting
for
them
at
the
door
,
stepped
forward
,
and
more
intent
on
*NL*
telling
the
news
than
giving
them
any
help
,
immediately
began
with
,
``
The
*NL*
Thrush
is
gone
out
of
harbour
,
please
sir
,
and
one
of
the
officers
has
*NL*
been
here
to
--
''
She
was
interrupted
by
a
fine
tall
boy
of
eleven
years
*NL*
old
,
who
,
rushing
out
of
the
house
,
pushed
the
maid
aside
,
and
while
*NL*
William
was
opening
the
chaise-door
himself
,
called
out
,
``
You
are
just
*NL*
in
time
.
We
have
been
looking
for
you
this
half-hour
.
The
Thrush
went
*NL*
out
of
harbour
this
morning
.
I
saw
her
.
It
was
a
beautiful
sight
.
And
*NL*
they
think
she
will
have
her
orders
in
a
day
or
two
.
And
Mr.
Campbell
*NL*
was
here
at
four
o'clock
to
ask
for
you
:
he
has
got
one
of
the
Thrush
's
*NL*
boats
,
and
is
going
off
to
her
at
six
,
and
hoped
you
would
be
here
in
*NL*
time
to
go
with
him
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
stare
or
two
at
Fanny
,
as
William
helped
her
out
of
the
carriage
,
was
*NL*
all
the
voluntary
notice
which
this
brother
bestowed
;
but
he
made
no
*NL*
objection
to
her
kissing
him
,
though
still
entirely
engaged
in
detailing
*NL*
farther
particulars
of
the
Thrush
's
going
out
of
harbour
,
in
which
*NL*
he
had
a
strong
right
of
interest
,
being
to
commence
his
career
of
*NL*
seamanship
in
her
at
this
very
time
.
*NL*
*NL*
Another
moment
and
Fanny
was
in
the
narrow
entrance-passage
of
the
*NL*
house
,
and
in
her
mother
's
arms
,
who
met
her
there
with
looks
of
true
*NL*
kindness
,
and
with
features
which
Fanny
loved
the
more
,
because
they
*NL*
brought
her
aunt
Bertram
's
before
her
,
and
there
were
her
two
sisters
:
*NL*
Susan
,
a
well-grown
fine
girl
of
fourteen
,
and
Betsey
,
the
youngest
of
*NL*
the
family
,
about
five
--
both
glad
to
see
her
in
their
way
,
though
with
*NL*
no
advantage
of
manner
in
receiving
her
.
But
manner
Fanny
did
not
want
.
*NL*
Would
they
but
love
her
,
she
should
be
satisfied
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
then
taken
into
a
parlour
,
so
small
that
her
first
conviction
*NL*
was
of
its
being
only
a
passage-room
to
something
better
,
and
she
stood
*NL*
for
a
moment
expecting
to
be
invited
on
;
but
when
she
saw
there
was
*NL*
no
other
door
,
and
that
there
were
signs
of
habitation
before
her
,
she
*NL*
called
back
her
thoughts
,
reproved
herself
,
and
grieved
lest
they
should
*NL*
have
been
suspected
.
Her
mother
,
however
,
could
not
stay
long
enough
*NL*
to
suspect
anything
.
She
was
gone
again
to
the
street-door
,
to
welcome
*NL*
William
.
``
Oh
!
my
dear
William
,
how
glad
I
am
to
see
you
.
But
have
you
*NL*
heard
about
the
Thrush
?
She
is
gone
out
of
harbour
already
;
three
days
*NL*
before
we
had
any
thought
of
it
;
and
I
do
not
know
what
I
am
to
do
about
*NL*
Sam
's
things
,
they
will
never
be
ready
in
time
;
for
she
may
have
her
*NL*
orders
to-morrow
,
perhaps
.
It
takes
me
quite
unawares
.
And
now
you
must
*NL*
be
off
for
Spithead
too
.
Campbell
has
been
here
,
quite
in
a
worry
about
*NL*
you
;
and
now
what
shall
we
do
?
I
thought
to
have
had
such
a
comfortable
*NL*
evening
with
you
,
and
here
everything
comes
upon
me
at
once
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Her
son
answered
cheerfully
,
telling
her
that
everything
was
always
for
*NL*
the
best
;
and
making
light
of
his
own
inconvenience
in
being
obliged
to
*NL*
hurry
away
so
soon
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
To
be
sure
,
I
had
much
rather
she
had
stayed
in
harbour
,
that
I
might
*NL*
have
sat
a
few
hours
with
you
in
comfort
;
but
as
there
is
a
boat
ashore
,
*NL*
I
had
better
go
off
at
once
,
and
there
is
no
help
for
it
.
Whereabouts
*NL*
does
the
Thrush
lay
at
Spithead
?
Near
the
Canopus
?
But
no
matter
;
here
's
*NL*
Fanny
in
the
parlour
,
and
why
should
we
stay
in
the
passage
?
Come
,
*NL*
mother
,
you
have
hardly
looked
at
your
own
dear
Fanny
yet
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
In
they
both
came
,
and
Mrs.
Price
having
kindly
kissed
her
daughter
*NL*
again
,
and
commented
a
little
on
her
growth
,
began
with
very
natural
*NL*
solicitude
to
feel
for
their
fatigues
and
wants
as
travellers
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Poor
dears
!
how
tired
you
must
both
be
!
and
now
,
what
will
you
have
?
I
*NL*
began
to
think
you
would
never
come
.
Betsey
and
I
have
been
watching
for
*NL*
you
this
half-hour
.
And
when
did
you
get
anything
to
eat
?
And
what
would
*NL*
you
like
to
have
now
?
I
could
not
tell
whether
you
would
be
for
some
*NL*
meat
,
or
only
a
dish
of
tea
,
after
your
journey
,
or
else
I
would
have
*NL*
got
something
ready
.
And
now
I
am
afraid
Campbell
will
be
here
before
*NL*
there
is
time
to
dress
a
steak
,
and
we
have
no
butcher
at
hand
.
It
is
*NL*
very
inconvenient
to
have
no
butcher
in
the
street
.
We
were
better
off
*NL*
in
our
last
house
.
Perhaps
you
would
like
some
tea
as
soon
as
it
can
be
*NL*
got
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
They
both
declared
they
should
prefer
it
to
anything
.
``
Then
,
Betsey
,
my
*NL*
dear
,
run
into
the
kitchen
and
see
if
Rebecca
has
put
the
water
on
;
and
*NL*
tell
her
to
bring
in
the
tea-things
as
soon
as
she
can
.
I
wish
we
could
*NL*
get
the
bell
mended
;
but
Betsey
is
a
very
handy
little
messenger
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Betsey
went
with
alacrity
,
proud
to
shew
her
abilities
before
her
fine
*NL*
new
sister
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
me
!
''
continued
the
anxious
mother
,
``
what
a
sad
fire
we
have
got
,
*NL*
and
I
dare
say
you
are
both
starved
with
cold
.
Draw
your
chair
nearer
,
*NL*
my
dear
.
I
can
not
think
what
Rebecca
has
been
about
.
I
am
sure
I
told
*NL*
her
to
bring
some
coals
half
an
hour
ago
.
Susan
,
you
should
have
taken
*NL*
care
of
the
fire
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
was
upstairs
,
mama
,
moving
my
things
,
''
said
Susan
,
in
a
fearless
,
*NL*
self-defending
tone
,
which
startled
Fanny
.
``
You
know
you
had
but
just
*NL*
settled
that
my
sister
Fanny
and
I
should
have
the
other
room
;
and
I
*NL*
could
not
get
Rebecca
to
give
me
any
help
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Farther
discussion
was
prevented
by
various
bustles
:
first
,
the
driver
*NL*
came
to
be
paid
;
then
there
was
a
squabble
between
Sam
and
Rebecca
about
*NL*
the
manner
of
carrying
up
his
sister
's
trunk
,
which
he
would
manage
all
*NL*
his
own
way
;
and
lastly
,
in
walked
Mr.
Price
himself
,
his
own
loud
voice
*NL*
preceding
him
,
as
with
something
of
the
oath
kind
he
kicked
away
his
*NL*
son
's
port-manteau
and
his
daughter
's
bandbox
in
the
passage
,
and
called
*NL*
out
for
a
candle
;
no
candle
was
brought
,
however
,
and
he
walked
into
the
*NL*
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
with
doubting
feelings
had
risen
to
meet
him
,
but
sank
down
again
*NL*
on
finding
herself
undistinguished
in
the
dusk
,
and
unthought
of
.
With
*NL*
a
friendly
shake
of
his
son
's
hand
,
and
an
eager
voice
,
he
instantly
*NL*
began
--
``
Ha
!
welcome
back
,
my
boy
.
Glad
to
see
you
.
Have
you
heard
the
*NL*
news
?
The
Thrush
went
out
of
harbour
this
morning
.
Sharp
is
the
*NL*
word
,
you
see
!
By
G
--
,
you
are
just
in
time
!
The
doctor
has
been
here
*NL*
inquiring
for
you
:
he
has
got
one
of
the
boats
,
and
is
to
be
off
for
*NL*
Spithead
by
six
,
so
you
had
better
go
with
him
.
I
have
been
to
Turner
's
*NL*
about
your
mess
;
it
is
all
in
a
way
to
be
done
.
I
should
not
wonder
if
*NL*
you
had
your
orders
to-morrow
:
but
you
can
not
sail
with
this
wind
,
if
*NL*
you
are
to
cruise
to
the
westward
;
and
Captain
Walsh
thinks
you
will
*NL*
certainly
have
a
cruise
to
the
westward
,
with
the
Elephant
.
By
G
--
,
I
*NL*
wish
you
may
!
But
old
Scholey
was
saying
,
just
now
,
that
he
thought
you
*NL*
would
be
sent
first
to
the
Texel
.
Well
,
well
,
we
are
ready
,
whatever
*NL*
happens
.
But
by
G
--
,
you
lost
a
fine
sight
by
not
being
here
in
the
*NL*
morning
to
see
the
Thrush
go
out
of
harbour
!
I
would
not
have
been
out
*NL*
of
the
way
for
a
thousand
pounds
.
Old
Scholey
ran
in
at
breakfast-time
,
*NL*
to
say
she
had
slipped
her
moorings
and
was
coming
out
,
I
jumped
up
,
and
*NL*
made
but
two
steps
to
the
platform
.
If
ever
there
was
a
perfect
beauty
*NL*
afloat
,
she
is
one
;
and
there
she
lays
at
Spithead
,
and
anybody
in
*NL*
England
would
take
her
for
an
eight-and-twenty
.
I
was
upon
the
platform
*NL*
two
hours
this
afternoon
looking
at
her
.
She
lays
close
to
the
Endymion
,
*NL*
between
her
and
the
Cleopatra
,
just
to
the
eastward
of
the
sheer
hulk
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Ha
!
''
cried
William
,
''
_
that
's
_
just
where
I
should
have
put
her
myself
.
*NL*
It
's
the
best
berth
at
Spithead
.
But
here
is
my
sister
,
sir
;
here
is
*NL*
Fanny
,
''
turning
and
leading
her
forward
;
``
it
is
so
dark
you
do
not
see
*NL*
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
With
an
acknowledgment
that
he
had
quite
forgot
her
,
Mr.
Price
now
*NL*
received
his
daughter
;
and
having
given
her
a
cordial
hug
,
and
observed
*NL*
that
she
was
grown
into
a
woman
,
and
he
supposed
would
be
wanting
a
*NL*
husband
soon
,
seemed
very
much
inclined
to
forget
her
again
.
Fanny
*NL*
shrunk
back
to
her
seat
,
with
feelings
sadly
pained
by
his
language
and
*NL*
his
smell
of
spirits
;
and
he
talked
on
only
to
his
son
,
and
only
of
the
*NL*
Thrush
,
though
William
,
warmly
interested
as
he
was
in
that
subject
,
*NL*
more
than
once
tried
to
make
his
father
think
of
Fanny
,
and
her
long
*NL*
absence
and
long
journey
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
sitting
some
time
longer
,
a
candle
was
obtained
;
but
as
there
was
*NL*
still
no
appearance
of
tea
,
nor
,
from
Betsey
's
reports
from
the
kitchen
,
*NL*
much
hope
of
any
under
a
considerable
period
,
William
determined
to
*NL*
go
and
change
his
dress
,
and
make
the
necessary
preparations
for
*NL*
his
removal
on
board
directly
,
that
he
might
have
his
tea
in
comfort
*NL*
afterwards
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
he
left
the
room
,
two
rosy-faced
boys
,
ragged
and
dirty
,
about
eight
*NL*
and
nine
years
old
,
rushed
into
it
just
released
from
school
,
and
coming
*NL*
eagerly
to
see
their
sister
,
and
tell
that
the
Thrush
was
gone
out
of
*NL*
harbour
;
Tom
and
Charles
.
Charles
had
been
born
since
Fanny
's
going
*NL*
away
,
but
Tom
she
had
often
helped
to
nurse
,
and
now
felt
a
particular
*NL*
pleasure
in
seeing
again
.
Both
were
kissed
very
tenderly
,
but
Tom
she
*NL*
wanted
to
keep
by
her
,
to
try
to
trace
the
features
of
the
baby
she
had
*NL*
loved
,
and
talked
to
,
of
his
infant
preference
of
herself
.
Tom
,
however
,
*NL*
had
no
mind
for
such
treatment
:
he
came
home
not
to
stand
and
be
talked
*NL*
to
,
but
to
run
about
and
make
a
noise
;
and
both
boys
had
soon
burst
from
*NL*
her
,
and
slammed
the
parlour-door
till
her
temples
ached
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
now
seen
all
that
were
at
home
;
there
remained
only
two
brothers
*NL*
between
herself
and
Susan
,
one
of
whom
was
a
clerk
in
a
public
office
*NL*
in
London
,
and
the
other
midshipman
on
board
an
Indiaman
.
But
though
she
*NL*
had
_
seen
_
all
the
members
of
the
family
,
she
had
not
yet
_
heard
_
all
*NL*
the
noise
they
could
make
.
Another
quarter
of
an
hour
brought
her
a
*NL*
great
deal
more
.
William
was
soon
calling
out
from
the
landing-place
of
*NL*
the
second
story
for
his
mother
and
for
Rebecca
.
He
was
in
distress
*NL*
for
something
that
he
had
left
there
,
and
did
not
find
again
.
A
key
was
*NL*
mislaid
,
Betsey
accused
of
having
got
at
his
new
hat
,
and
some
slight
,
*NL*
but
essential
alteration
of
his
uniform
waistcoat
,
which
he
had
been
*NL*
promised
to
have
done
for
him
,
entirely
neglected
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Price
,
Rebecca
,
and
Betsey
all
went
up
to
defend
themselves
,
all
*NL*
talking
together
,
but
Rebecca
loudest
,
and
the
job
was
to
be
done
as
*NL*
well
as
it
could
in
a
great
hurry
;
William
trying
in
vain
to
send
Betsey
*NL*
down
again
,
or
keep
her
from
being
troublesome
where
she
was
;
the
whole
*NL*
of
which
,
as
almost
every
door
in
the
house
was
open
,
could
be
plainly
*NL*
distinguished
in
the
parlour
,
except
when
drowned
at
intervals
by
the
*NL*
superior
noise
of
Sam
,
Tom
,
and
Charles
chasing
each
other
up
and
down
*NL*
stairs
,
and
tumbling
about
and
hallooing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
almost
stunned
.
The
smallness
of
the
house
and
thinness
of
the
*NL*
walls
brought
everything
so
close
to
her
,
that
,
added
to
the
fatigue
of
*NL*
her
journey
,
and
all
her
recent
agitation
,
she
hardly
knew
how
to
*NL*
bear
it
.
_
Within
_
the
room
all
was
tranquil
enough
,
for
Susan
having
*NL*
disappeared
with
the
others
,
there
were
soon
only
her
father
and
herself
*NL*
remaining
;
and
he
,
taking
out
a
newspaper
,
the
accustomary
loan
of
a
*NL*
neighbour
,
applied
himself
to
studying
it
,
without
seeming
to
recollect
*NL*
her
existence
.
The
solitary
candle
was
held
between
himself
and
the
*NL*
paper
,
without
any
reference
to
her
possible
convenience
;
but
she
had
*NL*
nothing
to
do
,
and
was
glad
to
have
the
light
screened
from
her
aching
*NL*
head
,
as
she
sat
in
bewildered
,
broken
,
sorrowful
contemplation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
at
home
.
But
,
alas
!
it
was
not
such
a
home
,
she
had
not
such
a
*NL*
welcome
,
as
--
she
checked
herself
;
she
was
unreasonable
.
What
right
had
*NL*
she
to
be
of
importance
to
her
family
?
She
could
have
none
,
so
long
lost
*NL*
sight
of
!
William
's
concerns
must
be
dearest
,
they
always
had
been
,
and
*NL*
he
had
every
right
.
Yet
to
have
so
little
said
or
asked
about
herself
,
*NL*
to
have
scarcely
an
inquiry
made
after
Mansfield
!
It
did
pain
her
to
*NL*
have
Mansfield
forgotten
;
the
friends
who
had
done
so
much
--
the
dear
,
*NL*
dear
friends
!
But
here
,
one
subject
swallowed
up
all
the
rest
.
Perhaps
*NL*
it
must
be
so
.
The
destination
of
the
Thrush
must
be
now
preeminently
*NL*
interesting
.
A
day
or
two
might
shew
the
difference
.
_
She
_
only
was
to
*NL*
blame
.
Yet
she
thought
it
would
not
have
been
so
at
Mansfield
.
No
,
in
*NL*
her
uncle
's
house
there
would
have
been
a
consideration
of
times
and
*NL*
seasons
,
a
regulation
of
subject
,
a
propriety
,
an
attention
towards
*NL*
everybody
which
there
was
not
here
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
only
interruption
which
thoughts
like
these
received
for
nearly
half
*NL*
an
hour
was
from
a
sudden
burst
of
her
father
's
,
not
at
all
calculated
*NL*
to
compose
them
.
At
a
more
than
ordinary
pitch
of
thumping
and
hallooing
*NL*
in
the
passage
,
he
exclaimed
,
``
Devil
take
those
young
dogs
!
How
they
are
*NL*
singing
out
!
Ay
,
Sam
's
voice
louder
than
all
the
rest
!
That
boy
is
fit
*NL*
for
a
boatswain
.
Holla
,
you
there
!
Sam
,
stop
your
confounded
pipe
,
or
I
*NL*
shall
be
after
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
threat
was
so
palpably
disregarded
,
that
though
within
five
minutes
*NL*
afterwards
the
three
boys
all
burst
into
the
room
together
and
sat
down
,
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
consider
it
as
a
proof
of
anything
more
than
their
*NL*
being
for
the
time
thoroughly
fagged
,
which
their
hot
faces
and
panting
*NL*
breaths
seemed
to
prove
,
especially
as
they
were
still
kicking
each
*NL*
other
's
shins
,
and
hallooing
out
at
sudden
starts
immediately
under
*NL*
their
father
's
eye
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
opening
of
the
door
brought
something
more
welcome
:
it
was
for
*NL*
the
tea-things
,
which
she
had
begun
almost
to
despair
of
seeing
that
*NL*
evening
.
Susan
and
an
attendant
girl
,
whose
inferior
appearance
informed
*NL*
Fanny
,
to
her
great
surprise
,
that
she
had
previously
seen
the
upper
*NL*
servant
,
brought
in
everything
necessary
for
the
meal
;
Susan
looking
,
as
*NL*
she
put
the
kettle
on
the
fire
and
glanced
at
her
sister
,
as
if
divided
*NL*
between
the
agreeable
triumph
of
shewing
her
activity
and
usefulness
,
*NL*
and
the
dread
of
being
thought
to
demean
herself
by
such
an
office
.
``
She
*NL*
had
been
into
the
kitchen
,
''
she
said
,
``
to
hurry
Sally
and
help
make
the
*NL*
toast
,
and
spread
the
bread
and
butter
,
or
she
did
not
know
when
they
*NL*
should
have
got
tea
,
and
she
was
sure
her
sister
must
want
something
*NL*
after
her
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
very
thankful
.
She
could
not
but
own
that
she
should
be
very
*NL*
glad
of
a
little
tea
,
and
Susan
immediately
set
about
making
it
,
as
if
*NL*
pleased
to
have
the
employment
all
to
herself
;
and
with
only
a
little
*NL*
unnecessary
bustle
,
and
some
few
injudicious
attempts
at
keeping
her
*NL*
brothers
in
better
order
than
she
could
,
acquitted
herself
very
well
.
*NL*
Fanny
's
spirit
was
as
much
refreshed
as
her
body
;
her
head
and
heart
*NL*
were
soon
the
better
for
such
well-timed
kindness
.
Susan
had
an
open
,
*NL*
sensible
countenance
;
she
was
like
William
,
and
Fanny
hoped
to
find
her
*NL*
like
him
in
disposition
and
goodwill
towards
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
more
placid
state
of
things
William
reentered
,
followed
not
*NL*
far
behind
by
his
mother
and
Betsey
.
He
,
complete
in
his
lieutenant
's
*NL*
uniform
,
looking
and
moving
all
the
taller
,
firmer
,
and
more
graceful
*NL*
for
it
,
and
with
the
happiest
smile
over
his
face
,
walked
up
directly
*NL*
to
Fanny
,
who
,
rising
from
her
seat
,
looked
at
him
for
a
moment
in
*NL*
speechless
admiration
,
and
then
threw
her
arms
round
his
neck
to
sob
out
*NL*
her
various
emotions
of
pain
and
pleasure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Anxious
not
to
appear
unhappy
,
she
soon
recovered
herself
;
and
wiping
*NL*
away
her
tears
,
was
able
to
notice
and
admire
all
the
striking
parts
*NL*
of
his
dress
;
listening
with
reviving
spirits
to
his
cheerful
hopes
of
*NL*
being
on
shore
some
part
of
every
day
before
they
sailed
,
and
even
of
*NL*
getting
her
to
Spithead
to
see
the
sloop
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
bustle
brought
in
Mr.
Campbell
,
the
surgeon
of
the
Thrush
,
a
*NL*
very
well-behaved
young
man
,
who
came
to
call
for
his
friend
,
and
for
*NL*
whom
there
was
with
some
contrivance
found
a
chair
,
and
with
some
hasty
*NL*
washing
of
the
young
tea-maker
's
,
a
cup
and
saucer
;
and
after
another
*NL*
quarter
of
an
hour
of
earnest
talk
between
the
gentlemen
,
noise
rising
*NL*
upon
noise
,
and
bustle
upon
bustle
,
men
and
boys
at
last
all
in
motion
*NL*
together
,
the
moment
came
for
setting
off
;
everything
was
ready
,
William
*NL*
took
leave
,
and
all
of
them
were
gone
;
for
the
three
boys
,
in
spite
*NL*
of
their
mother
's
entreaty
,
determined
to
see
their
brother
and
Mr.
*NL*
Campbell
to
the
sally-port
;
and
Mr.
Price
walked
off
at
the
same
time
to
*NL*
carry
back
his
neighbour
's
newspaper
.
*NL*
*NL*
Something
like
tranquillity
might
now
be
hoped
for
;
and
accordingly
,
*NL*
when
Rebecca
had
been
prevailed
on
to
carry
away
the
tea-things
,
*NL*
and
Mrs.
Price
had
walked
about
the
room
some
time
looking
for
a
*NL*
shirt-sleeve
,
which
Betsey
at
last
hunted
out
from
a
drawer
in
the
*NL*
kitchen
,
the
small
party
of
females
were
pretty
well
composed
,
and
the
*NL*
mother
having
lamented
again
over
the
impossibility
of
getting
Sam
ready
*NL*
in
time
,
was
at
leisure
to
think
of
her
eldest
daughter
and
the
friends
*NL*
she
had
come
from
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
few
inquiries
began
:
but
one
of
the
earliest
--
``
How
did
sister
Bertram
*NL*
manage
about
her
servants
?
''
``
Was
she
as
much
plagued
as
herself
to
get
*NL*
tolerable
servants
?
''
--
soon
led
her
mind
away
from
Northamptonshire
,
and
*NL*
fixed
it
on
her
own
domestic
grievances
,
and
the
shocking
character
of
*NL*
all
the
Portsmouth
servants
,
of
whom
she
believed
her
own
two
were
the
*NL*
very
worst
,
engrossed
her
completely
.
The
Bertrams
were
all
forgotten
*NL*
in
detailing
the
faults
of
Rebecca
,
against
whom
Susan
had
also
much
*NL*
to
depose
,
and
little
Betsey
a
great
deal
more
,
and
who
did
seem
so
*NL*
thoroughly
without
a
single
recommendation
,
that
Fanny
could
not
help
*NL*
modestly
presuming
that
her
mother
meant
to
part
with
her
when
her
year
*NL*
was
up
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Her
year
!
''
cried
Mrs.
Price
;
``
I
am
sure
I
hope
I
shall
be
rid
of
her
*NL*
before
she
has
staid
a
year
,
for
that
will
not
be
up
till
November
.
*NL*
Servants
are
come
to
such
a
pass
,
my
dear
,
in
Portsmouth
,
that
it
is
*NL*
quite
a
miracle
if
one
keeps
them
more
than
half
a
year
.
I
have
no
hope
*NL*
of
ever
being
settled
;
and
if
I
was
to
part
with
Rebecca
,
I
should
*NL*
only
get
something
worse
.
And
yet
I
do
not
think
I
am
a
very
difficult
*NL*
mistress
to
please
;
and
I
am
sure
the
place
is
easy
enough
,
for
there
is
*NL*
always
a
girl
under
her
,
and
I
often
do
half
the
work
myself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
silent
;
but
not
from
being
convinced
that
there
might
not
be
a
*NL*
remedy
found
for
some
of
these
evils
.
As
she
now
sat
looking
at
Betsey
,
*NL*
she
could
not
but
think
particularly
of
another
sister
,
a
very
pretty
*NL*
little
girl
,
whom
she
had
left
there
not
much
younger
when
she
went
into
*NL*
Northamptonshire
,
who
had
died
a
few
years
afterwards
.
There
had
been
*NL*
something
remarkably
amiable
about
her
.
Fanny
in
those
early
days
had
*NL*
preferred
her
to
Susan
;
and
when
the
news
of
her
death
had
at
last
*NL*
reached
Mansfield
,
had
for
a
short
time
been
quite
afflicted
.
The
sight
*NL*
of
Betsey
brought
the
image
of
little
Mary
back
again
,
but
she
would
*NL*
not
have
pained
her
mother
by
alluding
to
her
for
the
world
.
While
*NL*
considering
her
with
these
ideas
,
Betsey
,
at
a
small
distance
,
was
*NL*
holding
out
something
to
catch
her
eyes
,
meaning
to
screen
it
at
the
*NL*
same
time
from
Susan
's
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
What
have
you
got
there
,
my
love
?
''
said
Fanny
;
``
come
and
shew
it
to
*NL*
me
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
silver
knife
.
Up
jumped
Susan
,
claiming
it
as
her
own
,
and
*NL*
trying
to
get
it
away
;
but
the
child
ran
to
her
mother
's
protection
,
*NL*
and
Susan
could
only
reproach
,
which
she
did
very
warmly
,
and
evidently
*NL*
hoping
to
interest
Fanny
on
her
side
.
``
It
was
very
hard
that
she
was
not
*NL*
to
have
her
_
own
_
knife
;
it
was
her
own
knife
;
little
sister
Mary
had
*NL*
left
it
to
her
upon
her
deathbed
,
and
she
ought
to
have
had
it
to
keep
*NL*
herself
long
ago
.
But
mama
kept
it
from
her
,
and
was
always
letting
*NL*
Betsey
get
hold
of
it
;
and
the
end
of
it
would
be
that
Betsey
would
*NL*
spoil
it
,
and
get
it
for
her
own
,
though
mama
had
_
promised
_
her
that
*NL*
Betsey
should
not
have
it
in
her
own
hands
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
quite
shocked
.
Every
feeling
of
duty
,
honour
,
and
tenderness
*NL*
was
wounded
by
her
sister
's
speech
and
her
mother
's
reply
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Now
,
Susan
,
''
cried
Mrs.
Price
,
in
a
complaining
voice
,
``
now
,
how
can
*NL*
you
be
so
cross
?
You
are
always
quarrelling
about
that
knife
.
I
wish
you
*NL*
would
not
be
so
quarrelsome
.
Poor
little
Betsey
;
how
cross
Susan
is
to
*NL*
you
!
But
you
should
not
have
taken
it
out
,
my
dear
,
when
I
sent
you
to
*NL*
the
drawer
.
You
know
I
told
you
not
to
touch
it
,
because
Susan
is
so
*NL*
cross
about
it
.
I
must
hide
it
another
time
,
Betsey
.
Poor
Mary
little
*NL*
thought
it
would
be
such
a
bone
of
contention
when
she
gave
it
me
to
*NL*
keep
,
only
two
hours
before
she
died
.
Poor
little
soul
!
she
could
but
*NL*
just
speak
to
be
heard
,
and
she
said
so
prettily
,
`
Let
sister
Susan
have
*NL*
my
knife
,
mama
,
when
I
am
dead
and
buried
.
'
Poor
little
dear
!
she
was
so
*NL*
fond
of
it
,
Fanny
,
that
she
would
have
it
lay
by
her
in
bed
,
all
through
*NL*
her
illness
.
It
was
the
gift
of
her
good
godmother
,
old
Mrs.
Admiral
*NL*
Maxwell
,
only
six
weeks
before
she
was
taken
for
death
.
Poor
little
*NL*
sweet
creature
!
Well
,
she
was
taken
away
from
evil
to
come
.
My
own
*NL*
Betsey
''
-LRB-
fondling
her
-RRB-
,
''
_
you
_
have
not
the
luck
of
such
a
good
*NL*
godmother
.
Aunt
Norris
lives
too
far
off
to
think
of
such
little
people
*NL*
as
you
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
had
indeed
nothing
to
convey
from
aunt
Norris
,
but
a
message
to
*NL*
say
she
hoped
that
her
god-daughter
was
a
good
girl
,
and
learnt
her
*NL*
book
.
There
had
been
at
one
moment
a
slight
murmur
in
the
drawing-room
*NL*
at
Mansfield
Park
about
sending
her
a
prayer-book
;
but
no
second
sound
*NL*
had
been
heard
of
such
a
purpose
.
Mrs.
Norris
,
however
,
had
gone
home
*NL*
and
taken
down
two
old
prayer-books
of
her
husband
with
that
idea
;
but
,
*NL*
upon
examination
,
the
ardour
of
generosity
went
off
.
One
was
found
*NL*
to
have
too
small
a
print
for
a
child
's
eyes
,
and
the
other
to
be
too
*NL*
cumbersome
for
her
to
carry
about
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
,
fatigued
and
fatigued
again
,
was
thankful
to
accept
the
first
*NL*
invitation
of
going
to
bed
;
and
before
Betsey
had
finished
her
cry
at
*NL*
being
allowed
to
sit
up
only
one
hour
extraordinary
in
honour
of
sister
,
*NL*
she
was
off
,
leaving
all
below
in
confusion
and
noise
again
;
the
boys
*NL*
begging
for
toasted
cheese
,
her
father
calling
out
for
his
rum
and
*NL*
water
,
and
Rebecca
never
where
she
ought
to
be
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
nothing
to
raise
her
spirits
in
the
confined
and
scantily
*NL*
furnished
chamber
that
she
was
to
share
with
Susan
.
The
smallness
of
*NL*
the
rooms
above
and
below
,
indeed
,
and
the
narrowness
of
the
passage
and
*NL*
staircase
,
struck
her
beyond
her
imagination
.
She
soon
learned
to
think
*NL*
with
respect
of
her
own
little
attic
at
Mansfield
Park
,
in
_
that
_
house
*NL*
reckoned
too
small
for
anybody
's
comfort
.

CHAPTER
XXXIX
*NL*
*NL*
Could
Sir
Thomas
have
seen
all
his
niece
's
feelings
,
when
she
wrote
her
*NL*
first
letter
to
her
aunt
,
he
would
not
have
despaired
;
for
though
a
good
*NL*
night
's
rest
,
a
pleasant
morning
,
the
hope
of
soon
seeing
William
again
,
*NL*
and
the
comparatively
quiet
state
of
the
house
,
from
Tom
and
Charles
*NL*
being
gone
to
school
,
Sam
on
some
project
of
his
own
,
and
her
father
*NL*
on
his
usual
lounges
,
enabled
her
to
express
herself
cheerfully
on
the
*NL*
subject
of
home
,
there
were
still
,
to
her
own
perfect
consciousness
,
*NL*
many
drawbacks
suppressed
.
Could
he
have
seen
only
half
that
she
felt
*NL*
before
the
end
of
a
week
,
he
would
have
thought
Mr.
Crawford
sure
of
*NL*
her
,
and
been
delighted
with
his
own
sagacity
.
*NL*
*NL*
Before
the
week
ended
,
it
was
all
disappointment
.
In
the
first
place
,
*NL*
William
was
gone
.
The
Thrush
had
had
her
orders
,
the
wind
had
changed
,
*NL*
and
he
was
sailed
within
four
days
from
their
reaching
Portsmouth
;
and
*NL*
during
those
days
she
had
seen
him
only
twice
,
in
a
short
and
*NL*
hurried
way
,
when
he
had
come
ashore
on
duty
.
There
had
been
no
free
*NL*
conversation
,
no
walk
on
the
ramparts
,
no
visit
to
the
dockyard
,
no
*NL*
acquaintance
with
the
Thrush
,
nothing
of
all
that
they
had
planned
and
*NL*
depended
on
.
Everything
in
that
quarter
failed
her
,
except
William
's
*NL*
affection
.
His
last
thought
on
leaving
home
was
for
her
.
He
stepped
back
*NL*
again
to
the
door
to
say
,
``
Take
care
of
Fanny
,
mother
.
She
is
tender
,
*NL*
and
not
used
to
rough
it
like
the
rest
of
us
.
I
charge
you
,
take
care
of
*NL*
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
William
was
gone
:
and
the
home
he
had
left
her
in
was
,
Fanny
could
not
*NL*
conceal
it
from
herself
,
in
almost
every
respect
the
very
reverse
of
*NL*
what
she
could
have
wished
.
It
was
the
abode
of
noise
,
disorder
,
and
*NL*
impropriety
.
Nobody
was
in
their
right
place
,
nothing
was
done
as
it
*NL*
ought
to
be
.
She
could
not
respect
her
parents
as
she
had
hoped
.
On
her
*NL*
father
,
her
confidence
had
not
been
sanguine
,
but
he
was
more
negligent
*NL*
of
his
family
,
his
habits
were
worse
,
and
his
manners
coarser
,
than
*NL*
she
had
been
prepared
for
.
He
did
not
want
abilities
but
he
had
no
*NL*
curiosity
,
and
no
information
beyond
his
profession
;
he
read
only
*NL*
the
newspaper
and
the
navy-list
;
he
talked
only
of
the
dockyard
,
the
*NL*
harbour
,
Spithead
,
and
the
Motherbank
;
he
swore
and
he
drank
,
he
was
*NL*
dirty
and
gross
.
She
had
never
been
able
to
recall
anything
approaching
*NL*
to
tenderness
in
his
former
treatment
of
herself
.
There
had
remained
*NL*
only
a
general
impression
of
roughness
and
loudness
;
and
now
he
scarcely
*NL*
ever
noticed
her
,
but
to
make
her
the
object
of
a
coarse
joke
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
disappointment
in
her
mother
was
greater
:
_
there
_
she
had
hoped
*NL*
much
,
and
found
almost
nothing
.
Every
flattering
scheme
of
being
of
*NL*
consequence
to
her
soon
fell
to
the
ground
.
Mrs.
Price
was
not
unkind
;
*NL*
but
,
instead
of
gaining
on
her
affection
and
confidence
,
and
becoming
*NL*
more
and
more
dear
,
her
daughter
never
met
with
greater
kindness
from
*NL*
her
than
on
the
first
day
of
her
arrival
.
The
instinct
of
nature
was
*NL*
soon
satisfied
,
and
Mrs.
Price
's
attachment
had
no
other
source
.
Her
*NL*
heart
and
her
time
were
already
quite
full
;
she
had
neither
leisure
nor
*NL*
affection
to
bestow
on
Fanny
.
Her
daughters
never
had
been
much
to
her
.
*NL*
She
was
fond
of
her
sons
,
especially
of
William
,
but
Betsey
was
the
*NL*
first
of
her
girls
whom
she
had
ever
much
regarded
.
To
her
she
was
most
*NL*
injudiciously
indulgent
.
William
was
her
pride
;
Betsey
her
darling
;
*NL*
and
John
,
Richard
,
Sam
,
Tom
,
and
Charles
occupied
all
the
rest
of
her
*NL*
maternal
solicitude
,
alternately
her
worries
and
her
comforts
.
These
*NL*
shared
her
heart
:
her
time
was
given
chiefly
to
her
house
and
her
*NL*
servants
.
Her
days
were
spent
in
a
kind
of
slow
bustle
;
all
was
busy
*NL*
without
getting
on
,
always
behindhand
and
lamenting
it
,
without
altering
*NL*
her
ways
;
wishing
to
be
an
economist
,
without
contrivance
or
regularity
;
*NL*
dissatisfied
with
her
servants
,
without
skill
to
make
them
better
,
and
*NL*
whether
helping
,
or
reprimanding
,
or
indulging
them
,
without
any
power
*NL*
of
engaging
their
respect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Of
her
two
sisters
,
Mrs.
Price
very
much
more
resembled
Lady
Bertram
*NL*
than
Mrs.
Norris
.
She
was
a
manager
by
necessity
,
without
any
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
's
inclination
for
it
,
or
any
of
her
activity
.
Her
disposition
*NL*
was
naturally
easy
and
indolent
,
like
Lady
Bertram
's
;
and
a
situation
of
*NL*
similar
affluence
and
do-nothingness
would
have
been
much
more
suited
*NL*
to
her
capacity
than
the
exertions
and
self-denials
of
the
one
which
her
*NL*
imprudent
marriage
had
placed
her
in
.
She
might
have
made
just
as
good
a
*NL*
woman
of
consequence
as
Lady
Bertram
,
but
Mrs.
Norris
would
have
been
a
*NL*
more
respectable
mother
of
nine
children
on
a
small
income
.
*NL*
*NL*
Much
of
all
this
Fanny
could
not
but
be
sensible
of
.
She
might
scruple
*NL*
to
make
use
of
the
words
,
but
she
must
and
did
feel
that
her
mother
was
*NL*
a
partial
,
ill-judging
parent
,
a
dawdle
,
a
slattern
,
who
neither
taught
*NL*
nor
restrained
her
children
,
whose
house
was
the
scene
of
mismanagement
*NL*
and
discomfort
from
beginning
to
end
,
and
who
had
no
talent
,
no
*NL*
conversation
,
no
affection
towards
herself
;
no
curiosity
to
know
her
*NL*
better
,
no
desire
of
her
friendship
,
and
no
inclination
for
her
company
*NL*
that
could
lessen
her
sense
of
such
feelings
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
very
anxious
to
be
useful
,
and
not
to
appear
above
her
home
,
*NL*
or
in
any
way
disqualified
or
disinclined
,
by
her
foreign
education
,
*NL*
from
contributing
her
help
to
its
comforts
,
and
therefore
set
about
*NL*
working
for
Sam
immediately
;
and
by
working
early
and
late
,
with
*NL*
perseverance
and
great
despatch
,
did
so
much
that
the
boy
was
shipped
*NL*
off
at
last
,
with
more
than
half
his
linen
ready
.
She
had
great
pleasure
*NL*
in
feeling
her
usefulness
,
but
could
not
conceive
how
they
would
have
*NL*
managed
without
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sam
,
loud
and
overbearing
as
he
was
,
she
rather
regretted
when
he
went
,
*NL*
for
he
was
clever
and
intelligent
,
and
glad
to
be
employed
in
any
errand
*NL*
in
the
town
;
and
though
spurning
the
remonstrances
of
Susan
,
given
as
*NL*
they
were
,
though
very
reasonable
in
themselves
,
with
ill-timed
and
*NL*
powerless
warmth
,
was
beginning
to
be
influenced
by
Fanny
's
services
*NL*
and
gentle
persuasions
;
and
she
found
that
the
best
of
the
three
younger
*NL*
ones
was
gone
in
him
:
Tom
and
Charles
being
at
least
as
many
years
as
*NL*
they
were
his
juniors
distant
from
that
age
of
feeling
and
reason
,
which
*NL*
might
suggest
the
expediency
of
making
friends
,
and
of
endeavouring
to
*NL*
be
less
disagreeable
.
Their
sister
soon
despaired
of
making
the
smallest
*NL*
impression
on
_
them
_
;
they
were
quite
untameable
by
any
means
of
address
*NL*
which
she
had
spirits
or
time
to
attempt
.
Every
afternoon
brought
a
*NL*
return
of
their
riotous
games
all
over
the
house
;
and
she
very
early
*NL*
learned
to
sigh
at
the
approach
of
Saturday
's
constant
half-holiday
.
*NL*
*NL*
Betsey
,
too
,
a
spoiled
child
,
trained
up
to
think
the
alphabet
her
*NL*
greatest
enemy
,
left
to
be
with
the
servants
at
her
pleasure
,
and
*NL*
then
encouraged
to
report
any
evil
of
them
,
she
was
almost
as
ready
to
*NL*
despair
of
being
able
to
love
or
assist
;
and
of
Susan
's
temper
she
*NL*
had
many
doubts
.
Her
continual
disagreements
with
her
mother
,
her
rash
*NL*
squabbles
with
Tom
and
Charles
,
and
petulance
with
Betsey
,
were
at
least
*NL*
so
distressing
to
Fanny
that
,
though
admitting
they
were
by
no
means
*NL*
without
provocation
,
she
feared
the
disposition
that
could
push
them
to
*NL*
such
length
must
be
far
from
amiable
,
and
from
affording
any
repose
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
home
which
was
to
put
Mansfield
out
of
her
head
,
and
*NL*
teach
her
to
think
of
her
cousin
Edmund
with
moderated
feelings
.
On
the
*NL*
contrary
,
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
Mansfield
,
its
beloved
inmates
,
*NL*
its
happy
ways
.
Everything
where
she
now
was
in
full
contrast
to
it
.
The
*NL*
elegance
,
propriety
,
regularity
,
harmony
,
and
perhaps
,
above
all
,
the
*NL*
peace
and
tranquillity
of
Mansfield
,
were
brought
to
her
remembrance
*NL*
every
hour
of
the
day
,
by
the
prevalence
of
everything
opposite
to
them
*NL*
_
here
_
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
living
in
incessant
noise
was
,
to
a
frame
and
temper
delicate
and
*NL*
nervous
like
Fanny
's
,
an
evil
which
no
superadded
elegance
or
harmony
*NL*
could
have
entirely
atoned
for
.
It
was
the
greatest
misery
of
all
.
At
*NL*
Mansfield
,
no
sounds
of
contention
,
no
raised
voice
,
no
abrupt
bursts
,
*NL*
no
tread
of
violence
,
was
ever
heard
;
all
proceeded
in
a
regular
course
*NL*
of
cheerful
orderliness
;
everybody
had
their
due
importance
;
everybody
's
*NL*
feelings
were
consulted
.
If
tenderness
could
be
ever
supposed
wanting
,
*NL*
good
sense
and
good
breeding
supplied
its
place
;
and
as
to
the
little
*NL*
irritations
sometimes
introduced
by
aunt
Norris
,
they
were
short
,
they
*NL*
were
trifling
,
they
were
as
a
drop
of
water
to
the
ocean
,
compared
with
*NL*
the
ceaseless
tumult
of
her
present
abode
.
Here
everybody
was
noisy
,
*NL*
every
voice
was
loud
-LRB-
excepting
,
perhaps
,
her
mother
's
,
which
resembled
*NL*
the
soft
monotony
of
Lady
Bertram
's
,
only
worn
into
fretfulness
-RRB-
.
*NL*
Whatever
was
wanted
was
hallooed
for
,
and
the
servants
hallooed
out
*NL*
their
excuses
from
the
kitchen
.
The
doors
were
in
constant
banging
,
the
*NL*
stairs
were
never
at
rest
,
nothing
was
done
without
a
clatter
,
nobody
*NL*
sat
still
,
and
nobody
could
command
attention
when
they
spoke
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
a
review
of
the
two
houses
,
as
they
appeared
to
her
before
the
end
*NL*
of
a
week
,
Fanny
was
tempted
to
apply
to
them
Dr.
Johnson
's
celebrated
*NL*
judgment
as
to
matrimony
and
celibacy
,
and
say
,
that
though
Mansfield
*NL*
Park
might
have
some
pains
,
Portsmouth
could
have
no
pleasures
.

CHAPTER
XL
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
right
enough
in
not
expecting
to
hear
from
Miss
Crawford
now
*NL*
at
the
rapid
rate
in
which
their
correspondence
had
begun
;
Mary
's
next
*NL*
letter
was
after
a
decidedly
longer
interval
than
the
last
,
but
she
*NL*
was
not
right
in
supposing
that
such
an
interval
would
be
felt
a
great
*NL*
relief
to
herself
.
Here
was
another
strange
revolution
of
mind
!
She
was
*NL*
really
glad
to
receive
the
letter
when
it
did
come
.
In
her
present
exile
*NL*
from
good
society
,
and
distance
from
everything
that
had
been
wont
to
*NL*
interest
her
,
a
letter
from
one
belonging
to
the
set
where
her
heart
*NL*
lived
,
written
with
affection
,
and
some
degree
of
elegance
,
was
*NL*
thoroughly
acceptable
.
The
usual
plea
of
increasing
engagements
was
made
*NL*
in
excuse
for
not
having
written
to
her
earlier
;
``
And
now
that
I
have
*NL*
begun
,
''
she
continued
,
``
my
letter
will
not
be
worth
your
reading
,
for
*NL*
there
will
be
no
little
offering
of
love
at
the
end
,
no
three
or
four
*NL*
lines
_
passionnees
_
from
the
most
devoted
H.
C.
in
the
world
,
for
*NL*
Henry
is
in
Norfolk
;
business
called
him
to
Everingham
ten
days
ago
,
or
*NL*
perhaps
he
only
pretended
to
call
,
for
the
sake
of
being
travelling
*NL*
at
the
same
time
that
you
were
.
But
there
he
is
,
and
,
by
the
bye
,
his
*NL*
absence
may
sufficiently
account
for
any
remissness
of
his
sister
's
in
*NL*
writing
,
for
there
has
been
no
`
Well
,
Mary
,
when
do
you
write
to
Fanny
?
*NL*
Is
not
it
time
for
you
to
write
to
Fanny
?
'
to
spur
me
on
.
At
last
,
after
*NL*
various
attempts
at
meeting
,
I
have
seen
your
cousins
,
`
dear
Julia
and
*NL*
dearest
Mrs.
Rushworth
'
;
they
found
me
at
home
yesterday
,
and
we
were
*NL*
glad
to
see
each
other
again
.
We
_
seemed
_
_
very
_
glad
to
see
each
other
,
*NL*
and
I
do
really
think
we
were
a
little
.
We
had
a
vast
deal
to
say
.
Shall
*NL*
I
tell
you
how
Mrs.
Rushworth
looked
when
your
name
was
mentioned
?
I
did
*NL*
not
use
to
think
her
wanting
in
self-possession
,
but
she
had
not
quite
*NL*
enough
for
the
demands
of
yesterday
.
Upon
the
whole
,
Julia
was
in
the
*NL*
best
looks
of
the
two
,
at
least
after
you
were
spoken
of
.
There
was
no
*NL*
recovering
the
complexion
from
the
moment
that
I
spoke
of
`
Fanny
,
'
and
*NL*
spoke
of
her
as
a
sister
should
.
But
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
day
of
good
looks
*NL*
will
come
;
we
have
cards
for
her
first
party
on
the
28th
.
Then
she
*NL*
will
be
in
beauty
,
for
she
will
open
one
of
the
best
houses
in
Wimpole
*NL*
Street
.
I
was
in
it
two
years
ago
,
when
it
was
Lady
Lascelle
's
,
and
*NL*
prefer
it
to
almost
any
I
know
in
London
,
and
certainly
she
will
then
*NL*
feel
,
to
use
a
vulgar
phrase
,
that
she
has
got
her
pennyworth
for
her
*NL*
penny
.
Henry
could
not
have
afforded
her
such
a
house
.
I
hope
she
will
*NL*
recollect
it
,
and
be
satisfied
,
as
well
as
she
may
,
with
moving
the
*NL*
queen
of
a
palace
,
though
the
king
may
appear
best
in
the
background
;
*NL*
and
as
I
have
no
desire
to
tease
her
,
I
shall
never
_
force
_
your
name
*NL*
upon
her
again
.
She
will
grow
sober
by
degrees
.
From
all
that
I
hear
*NL*
and
guess
,
Baron
Wildenheim
's
attentions
to
Julia
continue
,
but
I
do
not
*NL*
know
that
he
has
any
serious
encouragement
.
She
ought
to
do
better
.
*NL*
A
poor
honourable
is
no
catch
,
and
I
can
not
imagine
any
liking
in
the
*NL*
case
,
for
take
away
his
rants
,
and
the
poor
baron
has
nothing
.
What
a
*NL*
difference
a
vowel
makes
!
If
his
rents
were
but
equal
to
his
rants
!
Your
*NL*
cousin
Edmund
moves
slowly
;
detained
,
perchance
,
by
parish
duties
.
There
*NL*
may
be
some
old
woman
at
Thornton
Lacey
to
be
converted
.
I
am
unwilling
*NL*
to
fancy
myself
neglected
for
a
_
young
_
one
.
Adieu
!
my
dear
sweet
Fanny
,
*NL*
this
is
a
long
letter
from
London
:
write
me
a
pretty
one
in
reply
to
*NL*
gladden
Henry
's
eyes
,
when
he
comes
back
,
and
send
me
an
account
of
all
*NL*
the
dashing
young
captains
whom
you
disdain
for
his
sake
.

*NL*
*NL*
There
was
great
food
for
meditation
in
this
letter
,
and
chiefly
for
*NL*
unpleasant
meditation
;
and
yet
,
with
all
the
uneasiness
it
supplied
,
it
*NL*
connected
her
with
the
absent
,
it
told
her
of
people
and
things
about
*NL*
whom
she
had
never
felt
so
much
curiosity
as
now
,
and
she
would
*NL*
have
been
glad
to
have
been
sure
of
such
a
letter
every
week
.
Her
*NL*
correspondence
with
her
aunt
Bertram
was
her
only
concern
of
higher
*NL*
interest
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
for
any
society
in
Portsmouth
,
that
could
at
all
make
amends
for
*NL*
deficiencies
at
home
,
there
were
none
within
the
circle
of
her
father
's
*NL*
and
mother
's
acquaintance
to
afford
her
the
smallest
satisfaction
:
she
*NL*
saw
nobody
in
whose
favour
she
could
wish
to
overcome
her
own
shyness
*NL*
and
reserve
.
The
men
appeared
to
her
all
coarse
,
the
women
all
pert
,
*NL*
everybody
underbred
;
and
she
gave
as
little
contentment
as
she
received
*NL*
from
introductions
either
to
old
or
new
acquaintance
.
The
young
ladies
*NL*
who
approached
her
at
first
with
some
respect
,
in
consideration
of
her
*NL*
coming
from
a
baronet
's
family
,
were
soon
offended
by
what
they
termed
*NL*
``
airs
''
;
for
,
as
she
neither
played
on
the
pianoforte
nor
wore
fine
*NL*
pelisses
,
they
could
,
on
farther
observation
,
admit
no
right
of
*NL*
superiority
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
solid
consolation
which
Fanny
received
for
the
evils
of
home
,
*NL*
the
first
which
her
judgment
could
entirely
approve
,
and
which
gave
any
*NL*
promise
of
durability
,
was
in
a
better
knowledge
of
Susan
,
and
a
hope
of
*NL*
being
of
service
to
her
.
Susan
had
always
behaved
pleasantly
to
herself
,
*NL*
but
the
determined
character
of
her
general
manners
had
astonished
*NL*
and
alarmed
her
,
and
it
was
at
least
a
fortnight
before
she
began
to
*NL*
understand
a
disposition
so
totally
different
from
her
own
.
Susan
saw
*NL*
that
much
was
wrong
at
home
,
and
wanted
to
set
it
right
.
That
a
girl
of
*NL*
fourteen
,
acting
only
on
her
own
unassisted
reason
,
should
err
in
the
*NL*
method
of
reform
,
was
not
wonderful
;
and
Fanny
soon
became
more
disposed
*NL*
to
admire
the
natural
light
of
the
mind
which
could
so
early
distinguish
*NL*
justly
,
than
to
censure
severely
the
faults
of
conduct
to
which
it
led
.
*NL*
Susan
was
only
acting
on
the
same
truths
,
and
pursuing
the
same
system
,
*NL*
which
her
own
judgment
acknowledged
,
but
which
her
more
supine
and
*NL*
yielding
temper
would
have
shrunk
from
asserting
.
Susan
tried
to
be
*NL*
useful
,
where
_
she
_
could
only
have
gone
away
and
cried
;
and
that
Susan
*NL*
was
useful
she
could
perceive
;
that
things
,
bad
as
they
were
,
would
*NL*
have
been
worse
but
for
such
interposition
,
and
that
both
her
mother
and
*NL*
Betsey
were
restrained
from
some
excesses
of
very
offensive
indulgence
*NL*
and
vulgarity
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
every
argument
with
her
mother
,
Susan
had
in
point
of
reason
the
*NL*
advantage
,
and
never
was
there
any
maternal
tenderness
to
buy
her
off
.
*NL*
The
blind
fondness
which
was
for
ever
producing
evil
around
her
she
had
*NL*
never
known
.
There
was
no
gratitude
for
affection
past
or
present
to
*NL*
make
her
better
bear
with
its
excesses
to
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
All
this
became
gradually
evident
,
and
gradually
placed
Susan
before
her
*NL*
sister
as
an
object
of
mingled
compassion
and
respect
.
That
her
manner
*NL*
was
wrong
,
however
,
at
times
very
wrong
,
her
measures
often
ill-chosen
*NL*
and
ill-timed
,
and
her
looks
and
language
very
often
indefensible
,
Fanny
*NL*
could
not
cease
to
feel
;
but
she
began
to
hope
they
might
be
rectified
.
*NL*
Susan
,
she
found
,
looked
up
to
her
and
wished
for
her
good
opinion
;
and
*NL*
new
as
anything
like
an
office
of
authority
was
to
Fanny
,
new
as
it
*NL*
was
to
imagine
herself
capable
of
guiding
or
informing
any
one
,
she
did
*NL*
resolve
to
give
occasional
hints
to
Susan
,
and
endeavour
to
exercise
for
*NL*
her
advantage
the
juster
notions
of
what
was
due
to
everybody
,
and
what
*NL*
would
be
wisest
for
herself
,
which
her
own
more
favoured
education
had
*NL*
fixed
in
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
influence
,
or
at
least
the
consciousness
and
use
of
it
,
originated
*NL*
in
an
act
of
kindness
by
Susan
,
which
,
after
many
hesitations
of
*NL*
delicacy
,
she
at
last
worked
herself
up
to
.
It
had
very
early
occurred
*NL*
to
her
that
a
small
sum
of
money
might
,
perhaps
,
restore
peace
for
*NL*
ever
on
the
sore
subject
of
the
silver
knife
,
canvassed
as
it
now
was
*NL*
continually
,
and
the
riches
which
she
was
in
possession
of
herself
,
*NL*
her
uncle
having
given
her
10
pounds
at
parting
,
made
her
as
able
as
she
was
*NL*
willing
to
be
generous
.
But
she
was
so
wholly
unused
to
confer
favours
,
*NL*
except
on
the
very
poor
,
so
unpractised
in
removing
evils
,
or
bestowing
*NL*
kindnesses
among
her
equals
,
and
so
fearful
of
appearing
to
elevate
*NL*
herself
as
a
great
lady
at
home
,
that
it
took
some
time
to
determine
*NL*
that
it
would
not
be
unbecoming
in
her
to
make
such
a
present
.
It
*NL*
was
made
,
however
,
at
last
:
a
silver
knife
was
bought
for
Betsey
,
and
*NL*
accepted
with
great
delight
,
its
newness
giving
it
every
advantage
*NL*
over
the
other
that
could
be
desired
;
Susan
was
established
in
the
full
*NL*
possession
of
her
own
,
Betsey
handsomely
declaring
that
now
she
had
got
*NL*
one
so
much
prettier
herself
,
she
should
never
want
_
that
_
again
;
and
*NL*
no
reproach
seemed
conveyed
to
the
equally
satisfied
mother
,
which
Fanny
*NL*
had
almost
feared
to
be
impossible
.
The
deed
thoroughly
answered
:
a
*NL*
source
of
domestic
altercation
was
entirely
done
away
,
and
it
was
the
*NL*
means
of
opening
Susan
's
heart
to
her
,
and
giving
her
something
more
to
*NL*
love
and
be
interested
in
.
Susan
shewed
that
she
had
delicacy
:
pleased
*NL*
as
she
was
to
be
mistress
of
property
which
she
had
been
struggling
for
*NL*
at
least
two
years
,
she
yet
feared
that
her
sister
's
judgment
had
been
*NL*
against
her
,
and
that
a
reproof
was
designed
her
for
having
so
struggled
*NL*
as
to
make
the
purchase
necessary
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
house
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
temper
was
open
.
She
acknowledged
her
fears
,
blamed
herself
for
*NL*
having
contended
so
warmly
;
and
from
that
hour
Fanny
,
understanding
the
*NL*
worth
of
her
disposition
and
perceiving
how
fully
she
was
inclined
to
*NL*
seek
her
good
opinion
and
refer
to
her
judgment
,
began
to
feel
again
the
*NL*
blessing
of
affection
,
and
to
entertain
the
hope
of
being
useful
to
a
*NL*
mind
so
much
in
need
of
help
,
and
so
much
deserving
it
.
She
gave
advice
,
*NL*
advice
too
sound
to
be
resisted
by
a
good
understanding
,
and
given
so
*NL*
mildly
and
considerately
as
not
to
irritate
an
imperfect
temper
,
and
she
*NL*
had
the
happiness
of
observing
its
good
effects
not
unfrequently
.
*NL*
More
was
not
expected
by
one
who
,
while
seeing
all
the
obligation
and
*NL*
expediency
of
submission
and
forbearance
,
saw
also
with
sympathetic
*NL*
acuteness
of
feeling
all
that
must
be
hourly
grating
to
a
girl
like
*NL*
Susan
.
Her
greatest
wonder
on
the
subject
soon
became
--
not
that
Susan
*NL*
should
have
been
provoked
into
disrespect
and
impatience
against
her
*NL*
better
knowledge
--
but
that
so
much
better
knowledge
,
so
many
good
*NL*
notions
should
have
been
hers
at
all
;
and
that
,
brought
up
in
the
midst
*NL*
of
negligence
and
error
,
she
should
have
formed
such
proper
opinions
*NL*
of
what
ought
to
be
;
she
,
who
had
had
no
cousin
Edmund
to
direct
her
*NL*
thoughts
or
fix
her
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
intimacy
thus
begun
between
them
was
a
material
advantage
to
*NL*
each
.
By
sitting
together
upstairs
,
they
avoided
a
great
deal
of
the
*NL*
disturbance
of
the
house
;
Fanny
had
peace
,
and
Susan
learned
to
think
it
*NL*
no
misfortune
to
be
quietly
employed
.
They
sat
without
a
fire
;
but
*NL*
that
was
a
privation
familiar
even
to
Fanny
,
and
she
suffered
the
*NL*
less
because
reminded
by
it
of
the
East
room
.
It
was
the
only
point
of
*NL*
resemblance
.
In
space
,
light
,
furniture
,
and
prospect
,
there
was
*NL*
nothing
alike
in
the
two
apartments
;
and
she
often
heaved
a
sigh
at
the
*NL*
remembrance
of
all
her
books
and
boxes
,
and
various
comforts
there
.
By
*NL*
degrees
the
girls
came
to
spend
the
chief
of
the
morning
upstairs
,
at
*NL*
first
only
in
working
and
talking
,
but
after
a
few
days
,
the
remembrance
*NL*
of
the
said
books
grew
so
potent
and
stimulative
that
Fanny
found
it
*NL*
impossible
not
to
try
for
books
again
.
There
were
none
in
her
father
's
*NL*
house
;
but
wealth
is
luxurious
and
daring
,
and
some
of
hers
found
its
*NL*
way
to
a
circulating
library
.
She
became
a
subscriber
;
amazed
at
being
*NL*
anything
_
in
propria
persona
_
,
amazed
at
her
own
doings
in
every
way
,
to
*NL*
be
a
renter
,
a
chuser
of
books
!
And
to
be
having
any
one
's
improvement
*NL*
in
view
in
her
choice
!
But
so
it
was
.
Susan
had
read
nothing
,
and
Fanny
*NL*
longed
to
give
her
a
share
in
her
own
first
pleasures
,
and
inspire
a
*NL*
taste
for
the
biography
and
poetry
which
she
delighted
in
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
occupation
she
hoped
,
moreover
,
to
bury
some
of
the
*NL*
recollections
of
Mansfield
,
which
were
too
apt
to
seize
her
mind
if
her
*NL*
fingers
only
were
busy
;
and
,
especially
at
this
time
,
hoped
it
might
*NL*
be
useful
in
diverting
her
thoughts
from
pursuing
Edmund
to
London
,
*NL*
whither
,
on
the
authority
of
her
aunt
's
last
letter
,
she
knew
he
was
*NL*
gone
.
She
had
no
doubt
of
what
would
ensue
.
The
promised
notification
*NL*
was
hanging
over
her
head
.
The
postman
's
knock
within
the
neighbourhood
*NL*
was
beginning
to
bring
its
daily
terrors
,
and
if
reading
could
banish
*NL*
the
idea
for
even
half
an
hour
,
it
was
something
gained
.
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
*NL*
CHAPTER
XLI
*NL*
*NL*
A
week
was
gone
since
Edmund
might
be
supposed
in
town
,
and
Fanny
had
*NL*
heard
nothing
of
him
.
There
were
three
different
conclusions
to
be
drawn
*NL*
from
his
silence
,
between
which
her
mind
was
in
fluctuation
;
each
of
*NL*
them
at
times
being
held
the
most
probable
.
Either
his
going
had
been
*NL*
again
delayed
,
or
he
had
yet
procured
no
opportunity
of
seeing
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
alone
,
or
he
was
too
happy
for
letter-writing
!
*NL*
*NL*
One
morning
,
about
this
time
,
Fanny
having
now
been
nearly
four
weeks
*NL*
from
Mansfield
,
a
point
which
she
never
failed
to
think
over
and
*NL*
calculate
every
day
,
as
she
and
Susan
were
preparing
to
remove
,
as
*NL*
usual
,
upstairs
,
they
were
stopped
by
the
knock
of
a
visitor
,
whom
they
*NL*
felt
they
could
not
avoid
,
from
Rebecca
's
alertness
in
going
to
the
*NL*
door
,
a
duty
which
always
interested
her
beyond
any
other
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
a
gentleman
's
voice
;
it
was
a
voice
that
Fanny
was
just
turning
*NL*
pale
about
,
when
Mr.
Crawford
walked
into
the
room
.
*NL*
*NL*
Good
sense
,
like
hers
,
will
always
act
when
really
called
upon
;
and
she
*NL*
found
that
she
had
been
able
to
name
him
to
her
mother
,
and
recall
her
*NL*
remembrance
of
the
name
,
as
that
of
``
William
's
friend
,
''
though
she
could
*NL*
not
previously
have
believed
herself
capable
of
uttering
a
syllable
*NL*
at
such
a
moment
.
The
consciousness
of
his
being
known
there
only
as
*NL*
William
's
friend
was
some
support
.
Having
introduced
him
,
however
,
and
*NL*
being
all
reseated
,
the
terrors
that
occurred
of
what
this
visit
might
*NL*
lead
to
were
overpowering
,
and
she
fancied
herself
on
the
point
of
*NL*
fainting
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
While
trying
to
keep
herself
alive
,
their
visitor
,
who
had
at
first
*NL*
approached
her
with
as
animated
a
countenance
as
ever
,
was
wisely
and
*NL*
kindly
keeping
his
eyes
away
,
and
giving
her
time
to
recover
,
while
he
*NL*
devoted
himself
entirely
to
her
mother
,
addressing
her
,
and
attending
*NL*
to
her
with
the
utmost
politeness
and
propriety
,
at
the
same
time
with
*NL*
a
degree
of
friendliness
,
of
interest
at
least
,
which
was
making
his
*NL*
manner
perfect
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Price
's
manners
were
also
at
their
best
.
Warmed
by
the
sight
of
*NL*
such
a
friend
to
her
son
,
and
regulated
by
the
wish
of
appearing
to
*NL*
advantage
before
him
,
she
was
overflowing
with
gratitude
--
artless
,
*NL*
maternal
gratitude
--
which
could
not
be
unpleasing
.
Mr.
Price
was
out
,
*NL*
which
she
regretted
very
much
.
Fanny
was
just
recovered
enough
to
*NL*
feel
that
_
she
_
could
not
regret
it
;
for
to
her
many
other
sources
of
*NL*
uneasiness
was
added
the
severe
one
of
shame
for
the
home
in
which
he
*NL*
found
her
.
She
might
scold
herself
for
the
weakness
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
scolding
it
away
.
She
was
ashamed
,
and
she
would
have
been
yet
more
*NL*
ashamed
of
her
father
than
of
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
talked
of
William
,
a
subject
on
which
Mrs.
Price
could
never
tire
;
*NL*
and
Mr.
Crawford
was
as
warm
in
his
commendation
as
even
her
heart
could
*NL*
wish
.
She
felt
that
she
had
never
seen
so
agreeable
a
man
in
her
life
;
*NL*
and
was
only
astonished
to
find
that
,
so
great
and
so
agreeable
as
he
*NL*
was
,
he
should
be
come
down
to
Portsmouth
neither
on
a
visit
to
the
*NL*
port-admiral
,
nor
the
commissioner
,
nor
yet
with
the
intention
of
going
*NL*
over
to
the
island
,
nor
of
seeing
the
dockyard
.
Nothing
of
all
that
she
*NL*
had
been
used
to
think
of
as
the
proof
of
importance
,
or
the
employment
*NL*
of
wealth
,
had
brought
him
to
Portsmouth
.
He
had
reached
it
late
the
*NL*
night
before
,
was
come
for
a
day
or
two
,
was
staying
at
the
Crown
,
had
*NL*
accidentally
met
with
a
navy
officer
or
two
of
his
acquaintance
since
*NL*
his
arrival
,
but
had
no
object
of
that
kind
in
coming
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
the
time
he
had
given
all
this
information
,
it
was
not
unreasonable
*NL*
to
suppose
that
Fanny
might
be
looked
at
and
spoken
to
;
and
she
was
*NL*
tolerably
able
to
bear
his
eye
,
and
hear
that
he
had
spent
half
an
hour
*NL*
with
his
sister
the
evening
before
his
leaving
London
;
that
she
had
*NL*
sent
her
best
and
kindest
love
,
but
had
had
no
time
for
writing
;
that
he
*NL*
thought
himself
lucky
in
seeing
Mary
for
even
half
an
hour
,
having
spent
*NL*
scarcely
twenty-four
hours
in
London
,
after
his
return
from
Norfolk
,
*NL*
before
he
set
off
again
;
that
her
cousin
Edmund
was
in
town
,
had
been
in
*NL*
town
,
he
understood
,
a
few
days
;
that
he
had
not
seen
him
himself
,
but
*NL*
that
he
was
well
,
had
left
them
all
well
at
Mansfield
,
and
was
to
dine
,
*NL*
as
yesterday
,
with
the
Frasers
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
listened
collectedly
,
even
to
the
last-mentioned
circumstance
;
*NL*
nay
,
it
seemed
a
relief
to
her
worn
mind
to
be
at
any
certainty
;
and
the
*NL*
words
,
``
then
by
this
time
it
is
all
settled
,
''
passed
internally
,
without
*NL*
more
evidence
of
emotion
than
a
faint
blush
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
talking
a
little
more
about
Mansfield
,
a
subject
in
which
her
*NL*
interest
was
most
apparent
,
Crawford
began
to
hint
at
the
expediency
of
*NL*
an
early
walk
.
``
It
was
a
lovely
morning
,
and
at
that
season
of
the
year
*NL*
a
fine
morning
so
often
turned
off
,
that
it
was
wisest
for
everybody
*NL*
not
to
delay
their
exercise
''
;
and
such
hints
producing
nothing
,
he
soon
*NL*
proceeded
to
a
positive
recommendation
to
Mrs.
Price
and
her
*NL*
daughters
to
take
their
walk
without
loss
of
time
.
Now
they
came
to
an
*NL*
understanding
.
Mrs.
Price
,
it
appeared
,
scarcely
ever
stirred
out
of
*NL*
doors
,
except
of
a
Sunday
;
she
owned
she
could
seldom
,
with
her
large
*NL*
family
,
find
time
for
a
walk
.
``
Would
she
not
,
then
,
persuade
her
*NL*
daughters
to
take
advantage
of
such
weather
,
and
allow
him
the
pleasure
*NL*
of
attending
them
?
''
Mrs.
Price
was
greatly
obliged
and
very
complying
.
*NL*
``
Her
daughters
were
very
much
confined
;
Portsmouth
was
a
sad
place
;
they
*NL*
did
not
often
get
out
;
and
she
knew
they
had
some
errands
in
the
town
,
*NL*
which
they
would
be
very
glad
to
do
.
''
And
the
consequence
was
,
that
*NL*
Fanny
,
strange
as
it
was
--
strange
,
awkward
,
and
distressing
--
found
*NL*
herself
and
Susan
,
within
ten
minutes
,
walking
towards
the
High
Street
*NL*
with
Mr.
Crawford
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
soon
pain
upon
pain
,
confusion
upon
confusion
;
for
they
were
*NL*
hardly
in
the
High
Street
before
they
met
her
father
,
whose
*NL*
appearance
was
not
the
better
from
its
being
Saturday
.
He
stopt
;
and
,
*NL*
ungentlemanlike
as
he
looked
,
Fanny
was
obliged
to
introduce
him
to
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
.
She
could
not
have
a
doubt
of
the
manner
in
which
Mr.
Crawford
*NL*
must
be
struck
.
He
must
be
ashamed
and
disgusted
altogether
.
He
must
*NL*
soon
give
her
up
,
and
cease
to
have
the
smallest
inclination
for
the
*NL*
match
;
and
yet
,
though
she
had
been
so
much
wanting
his
affection
to
*NL*
be
cured
,
this
was
a
sort
of
cure
that
would
be
almost
as
bad
as
the
*NL*
complaint
;
and
I
believe
there
is
scarcely
a
young
lady
in
the
United
*NL*
Kingdoms
who
would
not
rather
put
up
with
the
misfortune
of
being
sought
*NL*
by
a
clever
,
agreeable
man
,
than
have
him
driven
away
by
the
vulgarity
*NL*
of
her
nearest
relations
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
probably
could
not
regard
his
future
father-in-law
with
any
*NL*
idea
of
taking
him
for
a
model
in
dress
;
but
-LRB-
as
Fanny
instantly
,
and
to
*NL*
her
great
relief
,
discerned
-RRB-
her
father
was
a
very
different
man
,
a
*NL*
very
different
Mr.
Price
in
his
behaviour
to
this
most
highly
respected
*NL*
stranger
,
from
what
he
was
in
his
own
family
at
home
.
His
manners
*NL*
now
,
though
not
polished
,
were
more
than
passable
:
they
were
grateful
,
*NL*
animated
,
manly
;
his
expressions
were
those
of
an
attached
father
,
and
*NL*
a
sensible
man
;
his
loud
tones
did
very
well
in
the
open
air
,
and
there
*NL*
was
not
a
single
oath
to
be
heard
.
Such
was
his
instinctive
compliment
*NL*
to
the
good
manners
of
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
,
be
the
consequence
what
it
*NL*
might
,
Fanny
's
immediate
feelings
were
infinitely
soothed
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
conclusion
of
the
two
gentlemen
's
civilities
was
an
offer
of
Mr.
*NL*
Price
's
to
take
Mr.
Crawford
into
the
dockyard
,
which
Mr.
Crawford
,
*NL*
desirous
of
accepting
as
a
favour
what
was
intended
as
such
,
though
*NL*
he
had
seen
the
dockyard
again
and
again
,
and
hoping
to
be
so
much
the
*NL*
longer
with
Fanny
,
was
very
gratefully
disposed
to
avail
himself
of
,
if
*NL*
the
Miss
Prices
were
not
afraid
of
the
fatigue
;
and
as
it
was
somehow
or
*NL*
other
ascertained
,
or
inferred
,
or
at
least
acted
upon
,
that
they
were
*NL*
not
at
all
afraid
,
to
the
dockyard
they
were
all
to
go
;
and
but
for
*NL*
Mr.
Crawford
,
Mr.
Price
would
have
turned
thither
directly
,
without
the
*NL*
smallest
consideration
for
his
daughters
'
errands
in
the
High
Street
.
He
*NL*
took
care
,
however
,
that
they
should
be
allowed
to
go
to
the
shops
they
*NL*
came
out
expressly
to
visit
;
and
it
did
not
delay
them
long
,
for
Fanny
*NL*
could
so
little
bear
to
excite
impatience
,
or
be
waited
for
,
that
before
*NL*
the
gentlemen
,
as
they
stood
at
the
door
,
could
do
more
than
begin
upon
*NL*
the
last
naval
regulations
,
or
settle
the
number
of
three-deckers
now
in
*NL*
commission
,
their
companions
were
ready
to
proceed
.
*NL*
*NL*
They
were
then
to
set
forward
for
the
dockyard
at
once
,
and
the
walk
*NL*
would
have
been
conducted
--
according
to
Mr.
Crawford
's
opinion
--
in
a
*NL*
singular
manner
,
had
Mr.
Price
been
allowed
the
entire
regulation
of
it
,
*NL*
as
the
two
girls
,
he
found
,
would
have
been
left
to
follow
,
and
keep
up
*NL*
with
them
or
not
,
as
they
could
,
while
they
walked
on
together
at
their
*NL*
own
hasty
pace
.
He
was
able
to
introduce
some
improvement
occasionally
,
*NL*
though
by
no
means
to
the
extent
he
wished
;
he
absolutely
would
not
walk
*NL*
away
from
them
;
and
at
any
crossing
or
any
crowd
,
when
Mr.
Price
was
*NL*
only
calling
out
,
``
Come
,
girls
;
come
,
Fan
;
come
,
Sue
,
take
care
of
*NL*
yourselves
;
keep
a
sharp
lookout
!
''
he
would
give
them
his
particular
*NL*
attendance
.
*NL*
*NL*
Once
fairly
in
the
dockyard
,
he
began
to
reckon
upon
some
happy
*NL*
intercourse
with
Fanny
,
as
they
were
very
soon
joined
by
a
brother
*NL*
lounger
of
Mr.
Price
's
,
who
was
come
to
take
his
daily
survey
of
how
*NL*
things
went
on
,
and
who
must
prove
a
far
more
worthy
companion
than
*NL*
himself
;
and
after
a
time
the
two
officers
seemed
very
well
satisfied
*NL*
going
about
together
,
and
discussing
matters
of
equal
and
never-failing
*NL*
interest
,
while
the
young
people
sat
down
upon
some
timbers
in
the
yard
,
*NL*
or
found
a
seat
on
board
a
vessel
in
the
stocks
which
they
all
went
to
*NL*
look
at
.
Fanny
was
most
conveniently
in
want
of
rest
.
Crawford
could
not
*NL*
have
wished
her
more
fatigued
or
more
ready
to
sit
down
;
but
he
could
*NL*
have
wished
her
sister
away
.
A
quick-looking
girl
of
Susan
's
age
was
the
*NL*
very
worst
third
in
the
world
:
totally
different
from
Lady
Bertram
,
all
*NL*
eyes
and
ears
;
and
there
was
no
introducing
the
main
point
before
her
.
*NL*
He
must
content
himself
with
being
only
generally
agreeable
,
and
letting
*NL*
Susan
have
her
share
of
entertainment
,
with
the
indulgence
,
now
and
*NL*
then
,
of
a
look
or
hint
for
the
better-informed
and
conscious
Fanny
.
*NL*
Norfolk
was
what
he
had
mostly
to
talk
of
:
there
he
had
been
some
time
,
*NL*
and
everything
there
was
rising
in
importance
from
his
present
schemes
.
*NL*
Such
a
man
could
come
from
no
place
,
no
society
,
without
importing
*NL*
something
to
amuse
;
his
journeys
and
his
acquaintance
were
all
of
use
,
*NL*
and
Susan
was
entertained
in
a
way
quite
new
to
her
.
For
Fanny
,
somewhat
*NL*
more
was
related
than
the
accidental
agreeableness
of
the
parties
he
had
*NL*
been
in
.
For
her
approbation
,
the
particular
reason
of
his
going
into
*NL*
Norfolk
at
all
,
at
this
unusual
time
of
year
,
was
given
.
It
had
been
*NL*
real
business
,
relative
to
the
renewal
of
a
lease
in
which
the
welfare
*NL*
of
a
large
and
--
he
believed
--
industrious
family
was
at
stake
.
He
had
*NL*
suspected
his
agent
of
some
underhand
dealing
;
of
meaning
to
bias
*NL*
him
against
the
deserving
;
and
he
had
determined
to
go
himself
,
and
*NL*
thoroughly
investigate
the
merits
of
the
case
.
He
had
gone
,
had
done
*NL*
even
more
good
than
he
had
foreseen
,
had
been
useful
to
more
than
his
*NL*
first
plan
had
comprehended
,
and
was
now
able
to
congratulate
himself
*NL*
upon
it
,
and
to
feel
that
in
performing
a
duty
,
he
had
secured
agreeable
*NL*
recollections
for
his
own
mind
.
He
had
introduced
himself
to
some
*NL*
tenants
whom
he
had
never
seen
before
;
he
had
begun
making
acquaintance
*NL*
with
cottages
whose
very
existence
,
though
on
his
own
estate
,
had
been
*NL*
hitherto
unknown
to
him
.
This
was
aimed
,
and
well
aimed
,
at
Fanny
.
It
*NL*
was
pleasing
to
hear
him
speak
so
properly
;
here
he
had
been
acting
as
*NL*
he
ought
to
do
.
To
be
the
friend
of
the
poor
and
the
oppressed
!
Nothing
*NL*
could
be
more
grateful
to
her
;
and
she
was
on
the
point
of
giving
him
an
*NL*
approving
look
,
when
it
was
all
frightened
off
by
his
adding
a
something
*NL*
too
pointed
of
his
hoping
soon
to
have
an
assistant
,
a
friend
,
a
guide
*NL*
in
every
plan
of
utility
or
charity
for
Everingham
:
a
somebody
that
*NL*
would
make
Everingham
and
all
about
it
a
dearer
object
than
it
had
ever
*NL*
been
yet
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
turned
away
,
and
wished
he
would
not
say
such
things
.
She
was
*NL*
willing
to
allow
he
might
have
more
good
qualities
than
she
had
been
*NL*
wont
to
suppose
.
She
began
to
feel
the
possibility
of
his
turning
out
*NL*
well
at
last
;
but
he
was
and
must
ever
be
completely
unsuited
to
her
,
*NL*
and
ought
not
to
think
of
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
perceived
that
enough
had
been
said
of
Everingham
,
and
that
it
would
*NL*
be
as
well
to
talk
of
something
else
,
and
turned
to
Mansfield
.
He
could
*NL*
not
have
chosen
better
;
that
was
a
topic
to
bring
back
her
attention
and
*NL*
her
looks
almost
instantly
.
It
was
a
real
indulgence
to
her
to
hear
or
*NL*
to
speak
of
Mansfield
.
Now
so
long
divided
from
everybody
who
knew
the
*NL*
place
,
she
felt
it
quite
the
voice
of
a
friend
when
he
mentioned
it
,
*NL*
and
led
the
way
to
her
fond
exclamations
in
praise
of
its
beauties
and
*NL*
comforts
,
and
by
his
honourable
tribute
to
its
inhabitants
allowed
her
*NL*
to
gratify
her
own
heart
in
the
warmest
eulogium
,
in
speaking
of
her
*NL*
uncle
as
all
that
was
clever
and
good
,
and
her
aunt
as
having
the
*NL*
sweetest
of
all
sweet
tempers
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
had
a
great
attachment
to
Mansfield
himself
;
he
said
so
;
he
looked
*NL*
forward
with
the
hope
of
spending
much
,
very
much
,
of
his
time
there
;
*NL*
always
there
,
or
in
the
neighbourhood
.
He
particularly
built
upon
a
very
*NL*
happy
summer
and
autumn
there
this
year
;
he
felt
that
it
would
be
so
:
he
*NL*
depended
upon
it
;
a
summer
and
autumn
infinitely
superior
to
the
last
.
*NL*
As
animated
,
as
diversified
,
as
social
,
but
with
circumstances
of
*NL*
superiority
undescribable
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Mansfield
,
Sotherton
,
Thornton
Lacey
,
''
he
continued
;
``
what
a
society
*NL*
will
be
comprised
in
those
houses
!
And
at
Michaelmas
,
perhaps
,
a
fourth
*NL*
may
be
added
:
some
small
hunting-box
in
the
vicinity
of
everything
so
*NL*
dear
;
for
as
to
any
partnership
in
Thornton
Lacey
,
as
Edmund
Bertram
*NL*
once
good-humouredly
proposed
,
I
hope
I
foresee
two
objections
:
two
*NL*
fair
,
excellent
,
irresistible
objections
to
that
plan
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
doubly
silenced
here
;
though
when
the
moment
was
passed
,
*NL*
could
regret
that
she
had
not
forced
herself
into
the
acknowledged
*NL*
comprehension
of
one
half
of
his
meaning
,
and
encouraged
him
to
say
*NL*
something
more
of
his
sister
and
Edmund
.
It
was
a
subject
which
she
must
*NL*
learn
to
speak
of
,
and
the
weakness
that
shrunk
from
it
would
soon
be
*NL*
quite
unpardonable
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
Mr.
Price
and
his
friend
had
seen
all
that
they
wished
,
or
had
time
*NL*
for
,
the
others
were
ready
to
return
;
and
in
the
course
of
their
walk
*NL*
back
,
Mr.
Crawford
contrived
a
minute
's
privacy
for
telling
Fanny
that
*NL*
his
only
business
in
Portsmouth
was
to
see
her
;
that
he
was
come
down
*NL*
for
a
couple
of
days
on
her
account
,
and
hers
only
,
and
because
he
could
*NL*
not
endure
a
longer
total
separation
.
She
was
sorry
,
really
sorry
;
and
*NL*
yet
in
spite
of
this
and
the
two
or
three
other
things
which
she
wished
*NL*
he
had
not
said
,
she
thought
him
altogether
improved
since
she
had
seen
*NL*
him
;
he
was
much
more
gentle
,
obliging
,
and
attentive
to
other
people
's
*NL*
feelings
than
he
had
ever
been
at
Mansfield
;
she
had
never
seen
him
so
*NL*
agreeable
--
so
_
near
_
being
agreeable
;
his
behaviour
to
her
father
could
*NL*
not
offend
,
and
there
was
something
particularly
kind
and
proper
in
the
*NL*
notice
he
took
of
Susan
.
He
was
decidedly
improved
.
She
wished
the
next
*NL*
day
over
,
she
wished
he
had
come
only
for
one
day
;
but
it
was
not
*NL*
so
very
bad
as
she
would
have
expected
:
the
pleasure
of
talking
of
*NL*
Mansfield
was
so
very
great
!
*NL*
*NL*
Before
they
parted
,
she
had
to
thank
him
for
another
pleasure
,
and
one
*NL*
of
no
trivial
kind
.
Her
father
asked
him
to
do
them
the
honour
of
taking
*NL*
his
mutton
with
them
,
and
Fanny
had
time
for
only
one
thrill
of
horror
,
*NL*
before
he
declared
himself
prevented
by
a
prior
engagement
.
He
was
*NL*
engaged
to
dinner
already
both
for
that
day
and
the
next
;
he
had
met
*NL*
with
some
acquaintance
at
the
Crown
who
would
not
be
denied
;
he
should
*NL*
have
the
honour
,
however
,
of
waiting
on
them
again
on
the
morrow
,
etc.
,
*NL*
and
so
they
parted
--
Fanny
in
a
state
of
actual
felicity
from
escaping
so
*NL*
horrible
an
evil
!
*NL*
*NL*
To
have
had
him
join
their
family
dinner-party
,
and
see
all
their
*NL*
deficiencies
,
would
have
been
dreadful
!
Rebecca
's
cookery
and
Rebecca
's
*NL*
waiting
,
and
Betsey
's
eating
at
table
without
restraint
,
and
pulling
*NL*
everything
about
as
she
chose
,
were
what
Fanny
herself
was
not
yet
*NL*
enough
inured
to
for
her
often
to
make
a
tolerable
meal
.
_
She
_
was
nice
*NL*
only
from
natural
delicacy
,
but
_
he
_
had
been
brought
up
in
a
school
of
*NL*
luxury
and
epicurism
.

CHAPTER
XLII
*NL*
*NL*
The
Prices
were
just
setting
off
for
church
the
next
day
when
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
appeared
again
.
He
came
,
not
to
stop
,
but
to
join
them
;
he
was
*NL*
asked
to
go
with
them
to
the
Garrison
chapel
,
which
was
exactly
what
he
*NL*
had
intended
,
and
they
all
walked
thither
together
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
were
now
seen
to
advantage
.
Nature
had
given
them
no
*NL*
inconsiderable
share
of
beauty
,
and
every
Sunday
dressed
them
in
their
*NL*
cleanest
skins
and
best
attire
.
Sunday
always
brought
this
comfort
to
*NL*
Fanny
,
and
on
this
Sunday
she
felt
it
more
than
ever
.
Her
poor
mother
*NL*
now
did
not
look
so
very
unworthy
of
being
Lady
Bertram
's
sister
as
she
*NL*
was
but
too
apt
to
look
.
It
often
grieved
her
to
the
heart
to
think
of
*NL*
the
contrast
between
them
;
to
think
that
where
nature
had
made
so
little
*NL*
difference
,
circumstances
should
have
made
so
much
,
and
that
her
mother
,
*NL*
as
handsome
as
Lady
Bertram
,
and
some
years
her
junior
,
should
have
an
*NL*
appearance
so
much
more
worn
and
faded
,
so
comfortless
,
so
slatternly
,
*NL*
so
shabby
.
But
Sunday
made
her
a
very
creditable
and
tolerably
*NL*
cheerful-looking
Mrs.
Price
,
coming
abroad
with
a
fine
family
of
*NL*
children
,
feeling
a
little
respite
of
her
weekly
cares
,
and
only
*NL*
discomposed
if
she
saw
her
boys
run
into
danger
,
or
Rebecca
pass
by
with
*NL*
a
flower
in
her
hat
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
chapel
they
were
obliged
to
divide
,
but
Mr.
Crawford
took
care
not
to
*NL*
be
divided
from
the
female
branch
;
and
after
chapel
he
still
continued
*NL*
with
them
,
and
made
one
in
the
family
party
on
the
ramparts
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Price
took
her
weekly
walk
on
the
ramparts
every
fine
Sunday
*NL*
throughout
the
year
,
always
going
directly
after
morning
service
and
*NL*
staying
till
dinner-time
.
It
was
her
public
place
:
there
she
met
her
*NL*
acquaintance
,
heard
a
little
news
,
talked
over
the
badness
of
the
*NL*
Portsmouth
servants
,
and
wound
up
her
spirits
for
the
six
days
ensuing
.
*NL*
*NL*
Thither
they
now
went
;
Mr.
Crawford
most
happy
to
consider
the
Miss
*NL*
Prices
as
his
peculiar
charge
;
and
before
they
had
been
there
long
,
*NL*
somehow
or
other
,
there
was
no
saying
how
,
Fanny
could
not
have
believed
*NL*
it
,
but
he
was
walking
between
them
with
an
arm
of
each
under
his
,
*NL*
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
prevent
or
put
an
end
to
it
.
It
made
her
*NL*
uncomfortable
for
a
time
,
but
yet
there
were
enjoyments
in
the
day
and
*NL*
in
the
view
which
would
be
felt
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
day
was
uncommonly
lovely
.
It
was
really
March
;
but
it
was
April
in
*NL*
its
mild
air
,
brisk
soft
wind
,
and
bright
sun
,
occasionally
clouded
for
*NL*
a
minute
;
and
everything
looked
so
beautiful
under
the
influence
of
such
*NL*
a
sky
,
the
effects
of
the
shadows
pursuing
each
other
on
the
ships
at
*NL*
Spithead
and
the
island
beyond
,
with
the
ever-varying
hues
of
the
sea
,
*NL*
now
at
high
water
,
dancing
in
its
glee
and
dashing
against
the
ramparts
*NL*
with
so
fine
a
sound
,
produced
altogether
such
a
combination
of
charms
*NL*
for
Fanny
,
as
made
her
gradually
almost
careless
of
the
circumstances
*NL*
under
which
she
felt
them
.
Nay
,
had
she
been
without
his
arm
,
she
would
*NL*
soon
have
known
that
she
needed
it
,
for
she
wanted
strength
for
a
two
*NL*
hours
'
saunter
of
this
kind
,
coming
,
as
it
generally
did
,
upon
a
week
's
*NL*
previous
inactivity
.
Fanny
was
beginning
to
feel
the
effect
of
being
*NL*
debarred
from
her
usual
regular
exercise
;
she
had
lost
ground
as
to
*NL*
health
since
her
being
in
Portsmouth
;
and
but
for
Mr.
Crawford
and
the
*NL*
beauty
of
the
weather
would
soon
have
been
knocked
up
now
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
loveliness
of
the
day
,
and
of
the
view
,
he
felt
like
herself
.
They
*NL*
often
stopt
with
the
same
sentiment
and
taste
,
leaning
against
the
wall
,
*NL*
some
minutes
,
to
look
and
admire
;
and
considering
he
was
not
Edmund
,
*NL*
Fanny
could
not
but
allow
that
he
was
sufficiently
open
to
the
charms
*NL*
of
nature
,
and
very
well
able
to
express
his
admiration
.
She
had
a
few
*NL*
tender
reveries
now
and
then
,
which
he
could
sometimes
take
advantage
*NL*
of
to
look
in
her
face
without
detection
;
and
the
result
of
these
looks
*NL*
was
,
that
though
as
bewitching
as
ever
,
her
face
was
less
blooming
than
*NL*
it
ought
to
be
.
She
_
said
_
she
was
very
well
,
and
did
not
like
to
be
*NL*
supposed
otherwise
;
but
take
it
all
in
all
,
he
was
convinced
that
her
*NL*
present
residence
could
not
be
comfortable
,
and
therefore
could
not
*NL*
be
salutary
for
her
,
and
he
was
growing
anxious
for
her
being
again
at
*NL*
Mansfield
,
where
her
own
happiness
,
and
his
in
seeing
her
,
must
be
so
*NL*
much
greater
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
have
been
here
a
month
,
I
think
?
''
said
he
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
No
;
not
quite
a
month
.
It
is
only
four
weeks
to-morrow
since
I
left
*NL*
Mansfield
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
You
are
a
most
accurate
and
honest
reckoner
.
I
should
call
that
a
*NL*
month
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
did
not
arrive
here
till
Tuesday
evening
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
it
is
to
be
a
two
months
'
visit
,
is
not
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
.
My
uncle
talked
of
two
months
.
I
suppose
it
will
not
be
less
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
how
are
you
to
be
conveyed
back
again
?
Who
comes
for
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
do
not
know
.
I
have
heard
nothing
about
it
yet
from
my
aunt
.
Perhaps
*NL*
I
may
be
to
stay
longer
.
It
may
not
be
convenient
for
me
to
be
fetched
*NL*
exactly
at
the
two
months
'
end
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
moment
's
reflection
,
Mr.
Crawford
replied
,
``
I
know
Mansfield
,
I
*NL*
know
its
way
,
I
know
its
faults
towards
_
you
_
.
I
know
the
danger
of
*NL*
your
being
so
far
forgotten
,
as
to
have
your
comforts
give
way
to
the
*NL*
imaginary
convenience
of
any
single
being
in
the
family
.
I
am
aware
*NL*
that
you
may
be
left
here
week
after
week
,
if
Sir
Thomas
can
not
settle
*NL*
everything
for
coming
himself
,
or
sending
your
aunt
's
maid
for
you
,
*NL*
without
involving
the
slightest
alteration
of
the
arrangements
which
he
*NL*
may
have
laid
down
for
the
next
quarter
of
a
year
.
This
will
not
do
.
Two
*NL*
months
is
an
ample
allowance
;
I
should
think
six
weeks
quite
enough
.
*NL*
I
am
considering
your
sister
's
health
,
''
said
he
,
addressing
himself
to
*NL*
Susan
,
``
which
I
think
the
confinement
of
Portsmouth
unfavourable
to
.
She
*NL*
requires
constant
air
and
exercise
.
When
you
know
her
as
well
as
I
do
,
*NL*
I
am
sure
you
will
agree
that
she
does
,
and
that
she
ought
never
to
*NL*
be
long
banished
from
the
free
air
and
liberty
of
the
country
.
If
,
*NL*
therefore
''
-LRB-
turning
again
to
Fanny
-RRB-
,
``
you
find
yourself
growing
unwell
,
*NL*
and
any
difficulties
arise
about
your
returning
to
Mansfield
,
without
*NL*
waiting
for
the
two
months
to
be
ended
,
_
that
_
must
not
be
regarded
*NL*
as
of
any
consequence
,
if
you
feel
yourself
at
all
less
strong

*NL*
comfortable
than
usual
,

will
only
let
my
sister
know
it
,
give
her
*NL*
only
the
slightest
hint
,
she
and
I
will
immediately
come
down
,
and
take
*NL*
you
back
to
Mansfield
.
You
know
the
ease
and
the
pleasure
with
which
*NL*
this
would
be
done
.
You
know
all
that
would
be
felt
on
the
occasion

''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
thanked
him
,
but
tried
to
laugh
it
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
am
perfectly
serious
,
''
he
replied
,
``
as
you
perfectly
know

And
I
*NL*
hope
you
will
not
be
cruelly
concealing
any
tendency
to
indisposition

*NL*
Indeed
,
you
shall
_
not
_
;
it
shall
not
be
in
your
power
;
for
so
long
only
*NL*
as
you
positively
say
,
in
every
letter
to
Mary
,
'
I
am
well
,
'
and
I
*NL*
know
you
can
not
speak
or
write
a
falsehood
,
so
long
only
shall
you
be
*NL*
considered
as
well
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
thanked
him
again
,
but
was
affected
and
distressed
to
a
degree
*NL*
that
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
say
much
,
or
even
to
be
certain
of
*NL*
what
she
ought
to
say
.
This
was
towards
the
close
of
their
walk
.
He
*NL*
attended
them
to
the
last
,
and
left
them
only
at
the
door
of
their
own
*NL*
house
,
when
he
knew
them
to
be
going
to
dinner
,
and
therefore
pretended
*NL*
to
be
waited
for
elsewhere
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
wish
you
were
not
so
tired
,
''
said
he
,
still
detaining
Fanny
after
all
*NL*
the
others
were
in
the
house
--
``
I
wish
I
left
you
in
stronger
health
.
Is
*NL*
there
anything
I
can
do
for
you
in
town
?
I
have
half
an
idea
of
going
*NL*
into
Norfolk
again
soon
.
I
am
not
satisfied
about
Maddison
.
I
am
sure
*NL*
he
still
means
to
impose
on
me
if
possible
,
and
get
a
cousin
of
his
own
*NL*
into
a
certain
mill
,
which
I
design
for
somebody
else
.
I
must
come
to
an
*NL*
understanding
with
him
.
I
must
make
him
know
that
I
will
not
be
tricked
*NL*
on
the
south
side
of
Everingham
,
any
more
than
on
the
north
:
that
I
will
*NL*
be
master
of
my
own
property
.
I
was
not
explicit
enough
with
him
before
.
*NL*
The
mischief
such
a
man
does
on
an
estate
,
both
as
to
the
credit
of
his
*NL*
employer
and
the
welfare
of
the
poor
,
is
inconceivable
.
I
have
a
great
*NL*
mind
to
go
back
into
Norfolk
directly
,
and
put
everything
at
once
on
*NL*
such
a
footing
as
can
not
be
afterwards
swerved
from
.
Maddison
is
a
*NL*
clever
fellow
;
I
do
not
wish
to
displace
him
,
provided
he
does
not
try
*NL*
to
displace
_
me
_
;
but
it
would
be
simple
to
be
duped
by
a
man
who
has
no
*NL*
right
of
creditor
to
dupe
me
,
and
worse
than
simple
to
let
him
give
me
a
*NL*
hard-hearted
,
griping
fellow
for
a
tenant
,
instead
of
an
honest
man
,
*NL*
to
whom
I
have
given
half
a
promise
already
.
Would
it
not
be
worse
than
*NL*
simple
?
Shall
I
go
?
Do
you
advise
it
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
advise

You
know
very
well
what
is
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes

When
you
give
me
your
opinion
,
I
always
know
what
is
right

Your
*NL*
judgment
is
my
rule
of
right

''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Oh

no

do
not

so

We
have
all
a
better
guide
in
ourselves

would
attend
to
it

than
any
other
person
can
be

Good-bye

you
a

pleasant
journey
to-morrow

pressed
*NL*
her
hand
,
looked
at
her
,
and
was
gone
.
_
He
_
went
to
while
away
the
next
*NL*
three
hours
as
he
could
,
with
his
other
acquaintance
,
till
the
best
*NL*
dinner
that
a
capital
inn
afforded
was
ready
for
their
enjoyment
,
and
*NL*
_
she
_
turned
in
to
her
more
simple
one
immediately
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
general
fare
bore
a
very
different
character
;
and
could
he
have
*NL*
suspected
how
many
privations
,
besides
that
of
exercise
,
she
endured
in
*NL*
her
father
's
house
,
he
would
have
wondered
that
her
looks
were
not
much
*NL*
more
affected
than
he
found
them
.
She
was
so
little
equal
to
Rebecca
's
*NL*
puddings
and
Rebecca
's
hashes
,
brought
to
table
,
as
they
all
were
,
with
*NL*
such
accompaniments
of
half-cleaned
plates
,
and
not
half-cleaned
knives
*NL*
and
forks
,
that
she
was
very
often
constrained
to
defer
her
heartiest
*NL*
meal
till
she
could
send
her
brothers
in
the
evening
for
biscuits
and
*NL*
buns
.
After
being
nursed
up
at
Mansfield
,
it
was
too
late
in
the
day
*NL*
to
be
hardened
at
Portsmouth
;
and
though
Sir
Thomas
,
had
he
known
all
,
*NL*
might
have
thought
his
niece
in
the
most
promising
way
of
being
starved
,
*NL*
both
mind
and
body
,
into
a
much
juster
value
for
Mr.
Crawford
's
good
*NL*
company
and
good
fortune
,
he
would
probably
have
feared
to
push
his
*NL*
experiment
farther
,
lest
she
might
die
under
the
cure
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
out
of
spirits
all
the
rest
of
the
day
.
Though
tolerably
*NL*
secure
of
not
seeing
Mr.
Crawford
again
,
she
could
not
help
being
low
.
*NL*
It
was
parting
with
somebody
of
the
nature
of
a
friend
;
and
though
,
in
*NL*
one
light
,
glad
to
have
him
gone
,
it
seemed
as
if
she
was
now
deserted
*NL*
by
everybody
;
it
was
a
sort
of
renewed
separation
from
Mansfield
;
and
*NL*
she
could
not
think
of
his
returning
to
town
,
and
being
frequently
with
*NL*
Mary
and
Edmund
,
without
feelings
so
near
akin
to
envy
as
made
her
hate
*NL*
herself
for
having
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
dejection
had
no
abatement
from
anything
passing
around
her
;
a
*NL*
friend
or
two
of
her
father
's
,
as
always
happened
if
he
was
not
with
*NL*
them
,
spent
the
long
,
long
evening
there
;
and
from
six
o'clock
till
*NL*
half-past
nine
,
there
was
little
intermission
of
noise
or
grog
.
She
*NL*
was
very
low
.
The
wonderful
improvement
which
she
still
fancied
in
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
was
the
nearest
to
administering
comfort
of
anything
within
the
*NL*
current
of
her
thoughts
.
Not
considering
in
how
different
a
circle
she
*NL*
had
been
just
seeing
him
,
nor
how
much
might
be
owing
to
contrast
,
she
*NL*
was
quite
persuaded
of
his
being
astonishingly
more
gentle
and
regardful
*NL*
of
others
than
formerly
.
And
,
if
in
little
things
,
must
it
not
be
so
in
*NL*
great
?
So
anxious
for
her
health
and
comfort
,
so
very
feeling
as
he
now
*NL*
expressed
himself
,
and
really
seemed
,
might
not
it
be
fairly
supposed
*NL*
that
he
would
not
much
longer
persevere
in
a
suit
so
distressing
to
her
?
*NL*

CHAPTER
XLIII
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
presumed
that
Mr.
Crawford
was
travelling
back
,
to
London
,
on
the
*NL*
morrow
,
for
nothing
more
was
seen
of
him
at
Mr.
Price
's
;
and
two
days
*NL*
afterwards
,
it
was
a
fact
ascertained
to
Fanny
by
the
following
letter
*NL*
from
his
sister
,
opened
and
read
by
her
,
on
another
account
,
with
the
*NL*
most
anxious
curiosity
:
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
have
to
inform
you
,
my
dearest
Fanny
,
that
Henry
has
been
down
to
*NL*
Portsmouth
to
see
you
;
that
he
had
a
delightful
walk
with
you
to
the
*NL*
dockyard
last
Saturday
,
and
one
still
more
to
be
dwelt
on
the
next
day
,
*NL*
on
the
ramparts
;
when
the
balmy
air
,
the
sparkling
sea
,
and
your
sweet
*NL*
looks
and
conversation
were
altogether
in
the
most
delicious
harmony
,
*NL*
and
afforded
sensations
which
are
to
raise
ecstasy
even
in
retrospect
.
*NL*
This
,
as
well
as
I
understand
,
is
to
be
the
substance
of
my
information
.
*NL*
He
makes
me
write
,
but
I
do
not
know
what
else
is
to
be
communicated
,
*NL*
except
this
said
visit
to
Portsmouth
,
and
these
two
said
walks
,
and
his
*NL*
introduction
to
your
family
,
especially
to
a
fair
sister
of
yours
,
a
*NL*
fine
girl
of
fifteen
,
who
was
of
the
party
on
the
ramparts
,
taking
her
*NL*
first
lesson
,
I
presume
,
in
love
.
I
have
not
time
for
writing
much
,
but
*NL*
it
would
be
out
of
place
if
I
had
,
for
this
is
to
be
a
mere
letter
of
*NL*
business
,
penned
for
the
purpose
of
conveying
necessary
information
,
*NL*
which
could
not
be
delayed
without
risk
of
evil
.
My
dear
,
dear
Fanny
,
*NL*
if
I
had
you
here
,
how
I
would
talk
to
you
!
You
should
listen
to
me
till
*NL*
you
were
tired
,
and
advise
me
till
you
were
still
tired
more
;
but
it
is
*NL*
impossible
to
put
a
hundredth
part
of
my
great
mind
on
paper
,
so
I
will
*NL*
abstain
altogether
,
and
leave
you
to
guess
what
you
like
.
I
have
no
news
*NL*
for
you
.
You
have
politics
,
of
course
;
and
it
would
be
too
bad
to
plague
*NL*
you
with
the
names
of
people
and
parties
that
fill
up
my
time
.
I
ought
*NL*
to
have
sent
you
an
account
of
your
cousin
's
first
party
,
but
I
was
*NL*
lazy
,
and
now
it
is
too
long
ago
;
suffice
it
,
that
everything
was
just
*NL*
as
it
ought
to
be
,
in
a
style
that
any
of
her
connexions
must
have
been
*NL*
gratified
to
witness
,
and
that
her
own
dress
and
manners
did
her
the
*NL*
greatest
credit
.
My
friend
,
Mrs.
Fraser
,
is
mad
for
such
a
house
,
and
it
*NL*
would
not
make
_
me
_
miserable
.
I
go
to
Lady
Stornaway
after
Easter
;
*NL*
she
seems
in
high
spirits
,
and
very
happy
.
I
fancy
Lord
S.
is
very
*NL*
good-humoured
and
pleasant
in
his
own
family
,
and
I
do
not
think
him
so
*NL*
very
ill-looking
as
I
did
--
at
least
,
one
sees
many
worse
.
He
will
not
*NL*
do
by
the
side
of
your
cousin
Edmund
.
Of
the
last-mentioned
hero
,
what
*NL*
shall
I
say
?
If
I
avoided
his
name
entirely
,
it
would
look
suspicious
.
*NL*
I
will
say
,
then
,
that
we
have
seen
him
two
or
three
times
,
and
that
*NL*
my
friends
here
are
very
much
struck
with
his
gentlemanlike
appearance
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Fraser
-LRB-
no
bad
judge
-RRB-
declares
she
knows
but
three
men
in
town
*NL*
who
have
so
good
a
person
,
height
,
and
air
;
and
I
must
confess
,
when
he
*NL*
dined
here
the
other
day
,
there
were
none
to
compare
with
him
,
and
*NL*
we
were
a
party
of
sixteen
.
Luckily
there
is
no
distinction
of
dress
*NL*
nowadays
to
tell
tales
,
but
--
but
--
but
Yours
affectionately
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
almost
forgot
-LRB-
it
was
Edmund
's
fault
:
he
gets
into
my
head
more
*NL*
than
does
me
good
-RRB-
one
very
material
thing
I
had
to
say
from
Henry
and
*NL*
myself
--
I
mean
about
our
taking
you
back
into
Northamptonshire
.
My
dear
*NL*
little
creature
,
do
not
stay
at
Portsmouth
to
lose
your
pretty
looks
.
*NL*
Those
vile
sea-breezes
are
the
ruin
of
beauty
and
health
.
My
poor
aunt
*NL*
always
felt
affected
if
within
ten
miles
of
the
sea
,
which
the
Admiral
*NL*
of
course
never
believed
,
but
I
know
it
was
so
.
I
am
at
your
service
*NL*
and
Henry
's
,
at
an
hour
's
notice
.
I
should
like
the
scheme
,
and
we
would
*NL*
make
a
little
circuit
,
and
shew
you
Everingham
in
our
way
,
and
perhaps
*NL*
you
would
not
mind
passing
through
London
,
and
seeing
the
inside
of
St.
*NL*
George
's
,
Hanover
Square
.
Only
keep
your
cousin
Edmund
from
me
at
such
*NL*
a
time
:
I
should
not
like
to
be
tempted
.
What
a
long
letter
!
one
word
*NL*
more
.
Henry
,
I
find
,
has
some
idea
of
going
into
Norfolk
again
upon
*NL*
some
business
that
_
you
_
approve
;
but
this
can
not
possibly
be
permitted
*NL*
before
the
middle
of
next
week
;
that
is
,
he
can
not
anyhow
be
spared
till
*NL*
after
the
14th
,
for
_
we
_
have
a
party
that
evening
.
The
value
of
a
man
*NL*
like
Henry
,
on
such
an
occasion
,
is
what
you
can
have
no
conception
*NL*
of
;
so
you
must
take
it
upon
my
word
to
be
inestimable
.
He
will
see
the
*NL*
Rushworths
,
which
own
I
am
not
sorry
for
--
having
a
little
curiosity
,
and
*NL*
so
I
think
has
he
--
though
he
will
not
acknowledge
it
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
letter
to
be
run
through
eagerly
,
to
be
read
deliberately
,
*NL*
to
supply
matter
for
much
reflection
,
and
to
leave
everything
in
greater
*NL*
suspense
than
ever
.
The
only
certainty
to
be
drawn
from
it
was
,
that
*NL*
nothing
decisive
had
yet
taken
place
.
Edmund
had
not
yet
spoken
.
How
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
really
felt
,
how
she
meant
to
act
,
or
might
act
without
*NL*
or
against
her
meaning
;
whether
his
importance
to
her
were
quite
what
*NL*
it
had
been
before
the
last
separation
;
whether
,
if
lessened
,
it
were
*NL*
likely
to
lessen
more
,
or
to
recover
itself
,
were
subjects
for
endless
*NL*
conjecture
,
and
to
be
thought
of
on
that
day
and
many
days
to
come
,
*NL*
without
producing
any
conclusion
.
The
idea
that
returned
the
oftenest
*NL*
was
that
Miss
Crawford
,
after
proving
herself
cooled
and
staggered
by
*NL*
a
return
to
London
habits
,
would
yet
prove
herself
in
the
end
too
much
*NL*
attached
to
him
to
give
him
up
.
She
would
try
to
be
more
ambitious
than
*NL*
her
heart
would
allow
.
She
would
hesitate
,
she
would
tease
,
she
would
*NL*
condition
,
she
would
require
a
great
deal
,
but
she
would
finally
accept
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
Fanny
's
most
frequent
expectation
.
A
house
in
town
--
that
,
she
*NL*
thought
,
must
be
impossible
.
Yet
there
was
no
saying
what
Miss
Crawford
*NL*
might
not
ask
.
The
prospect
for
her
cousin
grew
worse
and
worse
.
The
*NL*
woman
who
could
speak
of
him
,
and
speak
only
of
his
appearance
!
What
an
*NL*
unworthy
attachment
!
To
be
deriving
support
from
the
commendations
of
*NL*
Mrs.
Fraser
!
_
She
_
who
had
known
him
intimately
half
a
year
!
Fanny
was
*NL*
ashamed
of
her
.
Those
parts
of
the
letter
which
related
only
to
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
and
herself
,
touched
her
,
in
comparison
,
slightly
.
Whether
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
went
into
Norfolk
before
or
after
the
14th
was
certainly
no
*NL*
concern
of
hers
,
though
,
everything
considered
,
she
thought
he
_
would
_
*NL*
go
without
delay
.
That
Miss
Crawford
should
endeavour
to
secure
a
*NL*
meeting
between
him
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
was
all
in
her
worst
line
of
*NL*
conduct
,
and
grossly
unkind
and
ill-judged
;
but
she
hoped
_
he
_
would
*NL*
not
be
actuated
by
any
such
degrading
curiosity
.
He
acknowledged
no
such
*NL*
inducement
,
and
his
sister
ought
to
have
given
him
credit
for
better
*NL*
feelings
than
her
own
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
yet
more
impatient
for
another
letter
from
town
after
receiving
*NL*
this
than
she
had
been
before
;
and
for
a
few
days
was
so
unsettled
by
*NL*
it
altogether
,
by
what
had
come
,
and
what
might
come
,
that
her
usual
*NL*
readings
and
conversation
with
Susan
were
much
suspended
.
She
could
*NL*
not
command
her
attention
as
she
wished
.
If
Mr.
Crawford
remembered
her
*NL*
message
to
her
cousin
,
she
thought
it
very
likely
,
most
likely
,
that
he
*NL*
would
write
to
her
at
all
events
;
it
would
be
most
consistent
with
his
*NL*
usual
kindness
;
and
till
she
got
rid
of
this
idea
,
till
it
gradually
*NL*
wore
off
,
by
no
letters
appearing
in
the
course
of
three
or
four
days
*NL*
more
,
she
was
in
a
most
restless
,
anxious
state
.
*NL*
*NL*
At
length
,
a
something
like
composure
succeeded
.
Suspense
must
be
*NL*
submitted
to
,
and
must
not
be
allowed
to
wear
her
out
,
and
make
her
*NL*
useless
.
Time
did
something
,
her
own
exertions
something
more
,
and
she
*NL*
resumed
her
attentions
to
Susan
,
and
again
awakened
the
same
interest
in
*NL*
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
was
growing
very
fond
of
her
,
and
though
without
any
of
the
early
*NL*
delight
in
books
which
had
been
so
strong
in
Fanny
,
with
a
disposition
*NL*
much
less
inclined
to
sedentary
pursuits
,
or
to
information
for
*NL*
information
's
sake
,
she
had
so
strong
a
desire
of
not
_
appearing
_
*NL*
ignorant
,
as
,
with
a
good
clear
understanding
,
made
her
a
most
*NL*
attentive
,
profitable
,
thankful
pupil
.
Fanny
was
her
oracle
.
Fanny
's
*NL*
explanations
and
remarks
were
a
most
important
addition
to
every
essay
,
*NL*
or
every
chapter
of
history
.
What
Fanny
told
her
of
former
times
dwelt
*NL*
more
on
her
mind
than
the
pages
of
Goldsmith
;
and
she
paid
her
sister
*NL*
the
compliment
of
preferring
her
style
to
that
of
any
printed
author
.
*NL*
The
early
habit
of
reading
was
wanting
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
conversations
,
however
,
were
not
always
on
subjects
so
high
as
*NL*
history
or
morals
.
Others
had
their
hour
;
and
of
lesser
matters
,
none
*NL*
returned
so
often
,
or
remained
so
long
between
them
,
as
Mansfield
Park
,
*NL*
a
description
of
the
people
,
the
manners
,
the
amusements
,
the
ways
*NL*
of
Mansfield
Park
.
Susan
,
who
had
an
innate
taste
for
the
genteel
and
*NL*
well-appointed
,
was
eager
to
hear
,
and
Fanny
could
not
but
indulge
*NL*
herself
in
dwelling
on
so
beloved
a
theme
.
She
hoped
it
was
not
wrong
;
*NL*
though
,
after
a
time
,
Susan
's
very
great
admiration
of
everything
*NL*
said
or
done
in
her
uncle
's
house
,
and
earnest
longing
to
go
into
*NL*
Northamptonshire
,
seemed
almost
to
blame
her
for
exciting
feelings
which
*NL*
could
not
be
gratified
.
*NL*
*NL*
Poor
Susan
was
very
little
better
fitted
for
home
than
her
elder
sister
;
*NL*
and
as
Fanny
grew
thoroughly
to
understand
this
,
she
began
to
feel
that
*NL*
when
her
own
release
from
Portsmouth
came
,
her
happiness
would
have
a
*NL*
material
drawback
in
leaving
Susan
behind
.
That
a
girl
so
capable
of
*NL*
being
made
everything
good
should
be
left
in
such
hands
,
distressed
her
*NL*
more
and
more
.
Were
_
she
_
likely
to
have
a
home
to
invite
her
to
,
what
*NL*
a
blessing
it
would
be
!
And
had
it
been
possible
for
her
to
return
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
's
regard
,
the
probability
of
his
being
very
far
from
objecting
*NL*
to
such
a
measure
would
have
been
the
greatest
increase
of
all
her
own
*NL*
comforts
.
She
thought
he
was
really
good-tempered
,
and
could
fancy
his
*NL*
entering
into
a
plan
of
that
sort
most
pleasantly
.

CHAPTER
XLIV
*NL*
*NL*
Seven
weeks
of
the
two
months
were
very
nearly
gone
,
when
the
one
*NL*
letter
,
the
letter
from
Edmund
,
so
long
expected
,
was
put
into
Fanny
's
*NL*
hands
.
As
she
opened
,
and
saw
its
length
,
she
prepared
herself
for
a
*NL*
minute
detail
of
happiness
and
a
profusion
of
love
and
praise
towards
*NL*
the
fortunate
creature
who
was
now
mistress
of
his
fate
.
These
were
the
*NL*
contents
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Dear
Fanny
,
--
Excuse
me
that
I
have
not
written
before
.
Crawford
told
*NL*
me
that
you
were
wishing
to
hear
from
me
,
but
I
found
it
impossible
to
*NL*
write
from
London
,
and
persuaded
myself
that
you
would
understand
my
*NL*
silence
.
Could
I
have
sent
a
few
happy
lines
,
they
should
not
have
been
*NL*
wanting
,
but
nothing
of
that
nature
was
ever
in
my
power
.
I
am
returned
*NL*
to
Mansfield
in
a
less
assured
state
than
when
I
left
it
.
My
hopes
are
*NL*
much
weaker
.
You
are
probably
aware
of
this
already
.
So
very
fond
of
you
*NL*
as
Miss
Crawford
is
,
it
is
most
natural
that
she
should
tell
you
enough
*NL*
of
her
own
feelings
to
furnish
a
tolerable
guess
at
mine
.
I
will
not
be
*NL*
prevented
,
however
,
from
making
my
own
communication
.
Our
confidences
in
*NL*
you
need
not
clash
.
I
ask
no
questions
.
There
is
something
soothing
*NL*
in
the
idea
that
we
have
the
same
friend
,
and
that
whatever
unhappy
*NL*
differences
of
opinion
may
exist
between
us
,
we
are
united
in
our
love
*NL*
of
you
.
It
will
be
a
comfort
to
me
to
tell
you
how
things
now
are
,
and
*NL*
what
are
my
present
plans
,
if
plans
I
can
be
said
to
have
.
I
have
been
*NL*
returned
since
Saturday
.
I
was
three
weeks
in
London
,
and
saw
her
-LRB-
for
*NL*
London
-RRB-
very
often
.
I
had
every
attention
from
the
Frasers
that
could
be
*NL*
reasonably
expected
.
I
dare
say
I
was
not
reasonable
in
carrying
with
*NL*
me
hopes
of
an
intercourse
at
all
like
that
of
Mansfield
.
It
was
her
*NL*
manner
,
however
,
rather
than
any
unfrequency
of
meeting
.
Had
she
been
*NL*
different
when
I
did
see
her
,
I
should
have
made
no
complaint
,
but
from
*NL*
the
very
first
she
was
altered
:
my
first
reception
was
so
unlike
what
I
*NL*
had
hoped
,
that
I
had
almost
resolved
on
leaving
London
again
directly
.
*NL*
I
need
not
particularise
.
You
know
the
weak
side
of
her
character
,
and
*NL*
may
imagine
the
sentiments
and
expressions
which
were
torturing
me
.
She
*NL*
was
in
high
spirits
,
and
surrounded
by
those
who
were
giving
all
the
*NL*
support
of
their
own
bad
sense
to
her
too
lively
mind
.
I
do
not
like
*NL*
Mrs.
Fraser
.
She
is
a
cold-hearted
,
vain
woman
,
who
has
married
entirely
*NL*
from
convenience
,
and
though
evidently
unhappy
in
her
marriage
,
*NL*
places
her
disappointment
not
to
faults
of
judgment
,
or
temper
,
or
*NL*
disproportion
of
age
,
but
to
her
being
,
after
all
,
less
affluent
than
*NL*
many
of
her
acquaintance
,
especially
than
her
sister
,
Lady
Stornaway
,
*NL*
and
is
the
determined
supporter
of
everything
mercenary
and
ambitious
,
*NL*
provided
it
be
only
mercenary
and
ambitious
enough
.
I
look
upon
her
*NL*
intimacy
with
those
two
sisters
as
the
greatest
misfortune
of
her
life
*NL*
and
mine
.
They
have
been
leading
her
astray
for
years
.
Could
she
be
*NL*
detached
from
them
!
--
and
sometimes
I
do
not
despair
of
it
,
for
the
*NL*
affection
appears
to
me
principally
on
their
side
.
They
are
very
fond
of
*NL*
her
;
but
I
am
sure
she
does
not
love
them
as
she
loves
you
.
When
I
think
*NL*
of
her
great
attachment
to
you
,
indeed
,
and
the
whole
of
her
judicious
,
*NL*
upright
conduct
as
a
sister
,
she
appears
a
very
different
creature
,
*NL*
capable
of
everything
noble
,
and
I
am
ready
to
blame
myself
for
a
too
*NL*
harsh
construction
of
a
playful
manner
.
I
can
not
give
her
up
,
Fanny
.
She
*NL*
is
the
only
woman
in
the
world
whom
I
could
ever
think
of
as
a
wife
.
If
*NL*
I
did
not
believe
that
she
had
some
regard
for
me
,
of
course
I
should
*NL*
not
say
this
,
but
I
do
believe
it
.
I
am
convinced
that
she
is
not
*NL*
without
a
decided
preference
.
I
have
no
jealousy
of
any
individual
.
It
*NL*
is
the
influence
of
the
fashionable
world
altogether
that
I
am
jealous
*NL*
of
.
It
is
the
habits
of
wealth
that
I
fear
.
Her
ideas
are
not
higher
*NL*
than
her
own
fortune
may
warrant
,
but
they
are
beyond
what
our
incomes
*NL*
united
could
authorise
.
There
is
comfort
,
however
,
even
here
.
I
could
*NL*
better
bear
to
lose
her
because
not
rich
enough
,
than
because
of
my
*NL*
profession
.
That
would
only
prove
her
affection
not
equal
to
sacrifices
,
*NL*
which
,
in
fact
,
I
am
scarcely
justified
in
asking
;
and
,
if
I
am
refused
,
*NL*
that
,
I
think
,
will
be
the
honest
motive
.
Her
prejudices
,
I
trust
,
are
*NL*
not
so
strong
as
they
were
.
You
have
my
thoughts
exactly
as
they
arise
,
*NL*
my
dear
Fanny
;
perhaps
they
are
sometimes
contradictory
,
but
it
will
*NL*
not
be
a
less
faithful
picture
of
my
mind
.
Having
once
begun
,
it
is
a
*NL*
pleasure
to
me
to
tell
you
all
I
feel
.
I
can
not
give
her
up
.
Connected
*NL*
as
we
already
are
,
and
,
I
hope
,
are
to
be
,
to
give
up
Mary
Crawford
*NL*
would
be
to
give
up
the
society
of
some
of
those
most
dear
to
me
;
to
*NL*
banish
myself
from
the
very
houses
and
friends
whom
,
under
any
other
*NL*
distress
,
I
should
turn
to
for
consolation
.
The
loss
of
Mary
I
must
*NL*
consider
as
comprehending
the
loss
of
Crawford
and
of
Fanny
.
Were
it
a
*NL*
decided
thing
,
an
actual
refusal
,
I
hope
I
should
know
how
to
bear
it
,
*NL*
and
how
to
endeavour
to
weaken
her
hold
on
my
heart
,
and
in
the
course
*NL*
of
a
few
years
--
but
I
am
writing
nonsense
.
Were
I
refused
,
I
must
bear
*NL*
it
;
and
till
I
am
,
I
can
never
cease
to
try
for
her
.
This
is
the
truth
.
*NL*
The
only
question
is
_
how
_
?
What
may
be
the
likeliest
means
?
I
have
*NL*
sometimes
thought
of
going
to
London
again
after
Easter
,
and
sometimes
*NL*
resolved
on
doing
nothing
till
she
returns
to
Mansfield
.
Even
now
,
she
*NL*
speaks
with
pleasure
of
being
in
Mansfield
in
June
;
but
June
is
at
*NL*
a
great
distance
,
and
I
believe
I
shall
write
to
her
.
I
have
nearly
*NL*
determined
on
explaining
myself
by
letter
.
To
be
at
an
early
certainty
*NL*
is
a
material
object
.
My
present
state
is
miserably
irksome
.
Considering
*NL*
everything
,
I
think
a
letter
will
be
decidedly
the
best
method
of
*NL*
explanation
.
I
shall
be
able
to
write
much
that
I
could
not
say
,
and
*NL*
shall
be
giving
her
time
for
reflection
before
she
resolves
on
her
*NL*
answer
,
and
I
am
less
afraid
of
the
result
of
reflection
than
of
an
*NL*
immediate
hasty
impulse
;
I
think
I
am
.
My
greatest
danger
would
lie
in
*NL*
her
consulting
Mrs.
Fraser
,
and
I
at
a
distance
unable
to
help
my
own
*NL*
cause
.
A
letter
exposes
to
all
the
evil
of
consultation
,
and
where
*NL*
the
mind
is
anything
short
of
perfect
decision
,
an
adviser
may
,
in
an
*NL*
unlucky
moment
,
lead
it
to
do
what
it
may
afterwards
regret
.
I
must
*NL*
think
this
matter
over
a
little
.
This
long
letter
,
full
of
my
own
*NL*
concerns
alone
,
will
be
enough
to
tire
even
the
friendship
of
a
Fanny
.
*NL*
The
last
time
I
saw
Crawford
was
at
Mrs.
Fraser
's
party
.
I
am
more
*NL*
and
more
satisfied
with
all
that
I
see
and
hear
of
him
.
There
is
not
a
*NL*
shadow
of
wavering
.
He
thoroughly
knows
his
own
mind
,
and
acts
up
to
his
*NL*
resolutions
:
an
inestimable
quality
.
I
could
not
see
him
and
my
eldest
*NL*
sister
in
the
same
room
without
recollecting
what
you
once
told
me
,
*NL*
and
I
acknowledge
that
they
did
not
meet
as
friends
.
There
was
*NL*
marked
coolness
on
her
side
.
They
scarcely
spoke
.
I
saw
him
draw
back
*NL*
surprised
,
and
I
was
sorry
that
Mrs.
Rushworth
should
resent
any
former
*NL*
supposed
slight
to
Miss
Bertram
.
You
will
wish
to
hear
my
opinion
*NL*
of
Maria
's
degree
of
comfort
as
a
wife
.
There
is
no
appearance
of
*NL*
unhappiness
.
I
hope
they
get
on
pretty
well
together
.
I
dined
twice
in
*NL*
Wimpole
Street
,
and
might
have
been
there
oftener
,
but
it
is
mortifying
*NL*
to
be
with
Rushworth
as
a
brother
.
Julia
seems
to
enjoy
London
*NL*
exceedingly
.
I
had
little
enjoyment
there
,
but
have
less
here
.
We
are
*NL*
not
a
lively
party
.
You
are
very
much
wanted
.
I
miss
you
more
than
I
*NL*
can
express
.
My
mother
desires
her
best
love
,
and
hopes
to
hear
from
*NL*
you
soon
.
She
talks
of
you
almost
every
hour
,
and
I
am
sorry
to
find
*NL*
how
many
weeks
more
she
is
likely
to
be
without
you
.
My
father
means
*NL*
to
fetch
you
himself
,
but
it
will
not
be
till
after
Easter
,
when
he
has
*NL*
business
in
town
.
You
are
happy
at
Portsmouth
,
I
hope
,
but
this
must
*NL*
not
be
a
yearly
visit
.
I
want
you
at
home
,
that
I
may
have
your
opinion
*NL*
about
Thornton
Lacey
.
I
have
little
heart
for
extensive
improvements
*NL*
till
I
know
that
it
will
ever
have
a
mistress
.
I
think
I
shall
certainly
*NL*
write
.
It
is
quite
settled
that
the
Grants
go
to
Bath
;
they
leave
*NL*
Mansfield
on
Monday
.
I
am
glad
of
it
.
I
am
not
comfortable
enough
to
be
*NL*
fit
for
anybody
;
but
your
aunt
seems
to
feel
out
of
luck
that
such
an
*NL*
article
of
Mansfield
news
should
fall
to
my
pen
instead
of
hers
.
--
Yours
*NL*
ever
,
my
dearest
Fanny
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
never
will
,
no
,
I
certainly
never
will
wish
for
a
letter
again
,
''
was
*NL*
Fanny
's
secret
declaration
as
she
finished
this
.
``
What
do
they
bring
but
*NL*
disappointment
and
sorrow
?
Not
till
after
Easter
!
How
shall
I
bear
it
?
*NL*
And
my
poor
aunt
talking
of
me
every
hour
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
checked
the
tendency
of
these
thoughts
as
well
as
she
could
,
but
*NL*
she
was
within
half
a
minute
of
starting
the
idea
that
Sir
Thomas
was
*NL*
quite
unkind
,
both
to
her
aunt
and
to
herself
.
As
for
the
main
subject
*NL*
of
the
letter
,
there
was
nothing
in
that
to
soothe
irritation
.
She
was
*NL*
almost
vexed
into
displeasure
and
anger
against
Edmund
.
``
There
is
no
*NL*
good
in
this
delay
,
''
said
she
.
``
Why
is
not
it
settled
?
He
is
blinded
,
*NL*
and
nothing
will
open
his
eyes
;
nothing
can
,
after
having
had
truths
*NL*
before
him
so
long
in
vain
.
He
will
marry
her
,
and
be
poor
and
*NL*
miserable
.
God
grant
that
her
influence
do
not
make
him
cease
to
be
*NL*
respectable
!
''
She
looked
over
the
letter
again
.
''
`
So
very
fond
of
me
!
'
*NL*
't
is
nonsense
all
.
She
loves
nobody
but
herself
and
her
brother
.
Her
*NL*
friends
leading
her
astray
for
years
!
She
is
quite
as
likely
to
have
led
*NL*
_
them
_
astray
.
They
have
all
,
perhaps
,
been
corrupting
one
another
;
but
*NL*
if
they
are
so
much
fonder
of
her
than
she
is
of
them
,
she
is
the
less
*NL*
likely
to
have
been
hurt
,
except
by
their
flattery
.
`
The
only
woman
in
*NL*
the
world
whom
he
could
ever
think
of
as
a
wife
.
'
I
firmly
believe
it
.
*NL*
It
is
an
attachment
to
govern
his
whole
life
.
Accepted
or
refused
,
his
*NL*
heart
is
wedded
to
her
for
ever
.
`
The
loss
of
Mary
I
must
consider
as
*NL*
comprehending
the
loss
of
Crawford
and
Fanny
.
'
Edmund
,
you
do
not
know
*NL*
me
.
The
families
would
never
be
connected
if
you
did
not
connect
*NL*
them
!
Oh
!
write
,
write
.
Finish
it
at
once
.
Let
there
be
an
end
of
this
*NL*
suspense
.
Fix
,
commit
,
condemn
yourself
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
sensations
,
however
,
were
too
near
akin
to
resentment
to
be
long
*NL*
guiding
Fanny
's
soliloquies
.
She
was
soon
more
softened
and
sorrowful
.
*NL*
His
warm
regard
,
his
kind
expressions
,
his
confidential
treatment
,
*NL*
touched
her
strongly
.
He
was
only
too
good
to
everybody
.
It
was
a
*NL*
letter
,
in
short
,
which
she
would
not
but
have
had
for
the
world
,
and
*NL*
which
could
never
be
valued
enough
.
This
was
the
end
of
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Everybody
at
all
addicted
to
letter-writing
,
without
having
much
to
say
,
*NL*
which
will
include
a
large
proportion
of
the
female
world
at
least
,
must
*NL*
feel
with
Lady
Bertram
that
she
was
out
of
luck
in
having
such
a
capital
*NL*
piece
of
Mansfield
news
as
the
certainty
of
the
Grants
going
to
Bath
,
*NL*
occur
at
a
time
when
she
could
make
no
advantage
of
it
,
and
will
admit
*NL*
that
it
must
have
been
very
mortifying
to
her
to
see
it
fall
to
the
*NL*
share
of
her
thankless
son
,
and
treated
as
concisely
as
possible
at
the
*NL*
end
of
a
long
letter
,
instead
of
having
it
to
spread
over
the
largest
*NL*
part
of
a
page
of
her
own
.
For
though
Lady
Bertram
rather
shone
in
the
*NL*
epistolary
line
,
having
early
in
her
marriage
,
from
the
want
of
other
*NL*
employment
,
and
the
circumstance
of
Sir
Thomas
's
being
in
Parliament
,
*NL*
got
into
the
way
of
making
and
keeping
correspondents
,
and
formed
for
*NL*
herself
a
very
creditable
,
common-place
,
amplifying
style
,
so
that
a
*NL*
very
little
matter
was
enough
for
her
:
she
could
not
do
entirely
without
*NL*
any
;
she
must
have
something
to
write
about
,
even
to
her
niece
;
and
*NL*
being
so
soon
to
lose
all
the
benefit
of
Dr.
Grant
's
gouty
symptoms
and
*NL*
Mrs.
Grant
's
morning
calls
,
it
was
very
hard
upon
her
to
be
deprived
of
*NL*
one
of
the
last
epistolary
uses
she
could
put
them
to
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
was
a
rich
amends
,
however
,
preparing
for
her
.
Lady
Bertram
's
*NL*
hour
of
good
luck
came
.
Within
a
few
days
from
the
receipt
of
Edmund
's
*NL*
letter
,
Fanny
had
one
from
her
aunt
,
beginning
thus
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
My
Dear
Fanny
,
--
I
take
up
my
pen
to
communicate
some
very
alarming
*NL*
intelligence
,
which
I
make
no
doubt
will
give
you
much
concern
''
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
was
a
great
deal
better
than
to
have
to
take
up
the
pen
to
acquaint
*NL*
her
with
all
the
particulars
of
the
Grants
'
intended
journey
,
for
the
*NL*
present
intelligence
was
of
a
nature
to
promise
occupation
for
the
pen
*NL*
for
many
days
to
come
,
being
no
less
than
the
dangerous
illness
of
her
*NL*
eldest
son
,
of
which
they
had
received
notice
by
express
a
few
hours
*NL*
before
.
*NL*
*NL*
Tom
had
gone
from
London
with
a
party
of
young
men
to
Newmarket
,
where
*NL*
a
neglected
fall
and
a
good
deal
of
drinking
had
brought
on
a
fever
;
and
*NL*
when
the
party
broke
up
,
being
unable
to
move
,
had
been
left
by
himself
*NL*
at
the
house
of
one
of
these
young
men
to
the
comforts
of
sickness
and
*NL*
solitude
,
and
the
attendance
only
of
servants
.
Instead
of
being
soon
*NL*
well
enough
to
follow
his
friends
,
as
he
had
then
hoped
,
his
disorder
*NL*
increased
considerably
,
and
it
was
not
long
before
he
thought
so
ill
of
*NL*
himself
as
to
be
as
ready
as
his
physician
to
have
a
letter
despatched
*NL*
to
Mansfield
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
This
distressing
intelligence
,
as
you
may
suppose
,
''
observed
*NL*
her
ladyship
,
after
giving
the
substance
of
it
,
``
has
agitated
us
*NL*
exceedingly
,
and
we
can
not
prevent
ourselves
from
being
greatly
alarmed
*NL*
and
apprehensive
for
the
poor
invalid
,
whose
state
Sir
Thomas
fears
*NL*
may
be
very
critical
;
and
Edmund
kindly
proposes
attending
his
brother
*NL*
immediately
,
but
I
am
happy
to
add
that
Sir
Thomas
will
not
leave
me
on
*NL*
this
distressing
occasion
,
as
it
would
be
too
trying
for
me
.
We
shall
*NL*
greatly
miss
Edmund
in
our
small
circle
,
but
I
trust
and
hope
he
*NL*
will
find
the
poor
invalid
in
a
less
alarming
state
than
might
be
*NL*
apprehended
,
and
that
he
will
be
able
to
bring
him
to
Mansfield
shortly
,
*NL*
which
Sir
Thomas
proposes
should
be
done
,
and
thinks
best
on
every
*NL*
account
,
and
I
flatter
myself
the
poor
sufferer
will
soon
be
able
to
*NL*
bear
the
removal
without
material
inconvenience
or
injury
.
As
I
*NL*
have
little
doubt
of
your
feeling
for
us
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
under
these
*NL*
distressing
circumstances
,
I
will
write
again
very
soon
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
feelings
on
the
occasion
were
indeed
considerably
more
warm
and
*NL*
genuine
than
her
aunt
's
style
of
writing
.
She
felt
truly
for
them
all
.
*NL*
Tom
dangerously
ill
,
Edmund
gone
to
attend
him
,
and
the
sadly
small
*NL*
party
remaining
at
Mansfield
,
were
cares
to
shut
out
every
other
care
,
*NL*
or
almost
every
other
.
She
could
just
find
selfishness
enough
to
wonder
*NL*
whether
Edmund
_
had
_
written
to
Miss
Crawford
before
this
summons
came
,
*NL*
but
no
sentiment
dwelt
long
with
her
that
was
not
purely
affectionate
*NL*
and
disinterestedly
anxious
.
Her
aunt
did
not
neglect
her
:
she
wrote
*NL*
again
and
again
;
they
were
receiving
frequent
accounts
from
Edmund
,
*NL*
and
these
accounts
were
as
regularly
transmitted
to
Fanny
,
in
the
same
*NL*
diffuse
style
,
and
the
same
medley
of
trusts
,
hopes
,
and
fears
,
all
*NL*
following
and
producing
each
other
at
haphazard
.
It
was
a
sort
of
*NL*
playing
at
being
frightened
.
The
sufferings
which
Lady
Bertram
did
not
*NL*
see
had
little
power
over
her
fancy
;
and
she
wrote
very
comfortably
*NL*
about
agitation
,
and
anxiety
,
and
poor
invalids
,
till
Tom
was
actually
*NL*
conveyed
to
Mansfield
,
and
her
own
eyes
had
beheld
his
altered
*NL*
appearance
.
Then
a
letter
which
she
had
been
previously
preparing
for
*NL*
Fanny
was
finished
in
a
different
style
,
in
the
language
of
real
feeling
*NL*
and
alarm
;
then
she
wrote
as
she
might
have
spoken
.
``
He
is
just
come
,
my
*NL*
dear
Fanny
,
and
is
taken
upstairs
;
and
I
am
so
shocked
to
see
him
,
that
*NL*
I
do
not
know
what
to
do
.
I
am
sure
he
has
been
very
ill
.
Poor
Tom
!
I
am
*NL*
quite
grieved
for
him
,
and
very
much
frightened
,
and
so
is
Sir
Thomas
;
*NL*
and
how
glad
I
should
be
if
you
were
here
to
comfort
me
.
But
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
hopes
he
will
be
better
to-morrow
,
and
says
we
must
consider
his
*NL*
journey
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
real
solicitude
now
awakened
in
the
maternal
bosom
was
not
*NL*
soon
over
.
Tom
's
extreme
impatience
to
be
removed
to
Mansfield
,
and
*NL*
experience
those
comforts
of
home
and
family
which
had
been
little
*NL*
thought
of
in
uninterrupted
health
,
had
probably
induced
his
being
*NL*
conveyed
thither
too
early
,
as
a
return
of
fever
came
on
,
and
for
a
week
*NL*
he
was
in
a
more
alarming
state
than
ever
.
They
were
all
very
seriously
*NL*
frightened
.
Lady
Bertram
wrote
her
daily
terrors
to
her
niece
,
who
*NL*
might
now
be
said
to
live
upon
letters
,
and
pass
all
her
time
between
*NL*
suffering
from
that
of
to-day
and
looking
forward
to
to-morrow
's
.
*NL*
Without
any
particular
affection
for
her
eldest
cousin
,
her
tenderness
*NL*
of
heart
made
her
feel
that
she
could
not
spare
him
,
and
the
purity
of
*NL*
her
principles
added
yet
a
keener
solicitude
,
when
she
considered
how
*NL*
little
useful
,
how
little
self-denying
his
life
had
-LRB-
apparently
-RRB-
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
was
her
only
companion
and
listener
on
this
,
as
on
more
common
*NL*
occasions
.
Susan
was
always
ready
to
hear
and
to
sympathise
.
Nobody
else
*NL*
could
be
interested
in
so
remote
an
evil
as
illness
in
a
family
above
an
*NL*
hundred
miles
off
;
not
even
Mrs.
Price
,
beyond
a
brief
question
or
two
,
*NL*
if
she
saw
her
daughter
with
a
letter
in
her
hand
,
and
now
and
then
the
*NL*
quiet
observation
of
,
``
My
poor
sister
Bertram
must
be
in
a
great
deal
of
*NL*
trouble
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
So
long
divided
and
so
differently
situated
,
the
ties
of
blood
were
*NL*
little
more
than
nothing
.
An
attachment
,
originally
as
tranquil
as
their
*NL*
tempers
,
was
now
become
a
mere
name
.
Mrs.
Price
did
quite
as
much
for
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
as
Lady
Bertram
would
have
done
for
Mrs.
Price
.
Three
or
*NL*
four
Prices
might
have
been
swept
away
,
any
or
all
except
Fanny
and
*NL*
William
,
and
Lady
Bertram
would
have
thought
little
about
it
;
or
perhaps
*NL*
might
have
caught
from
Mrs.
Norris
's
lips
the
cant
of
its
being
a
very
*NL*
happy
thing
and
a
great
blessing
to
their
poor
dear
sister
Price
to
have
*NL*
them
so
well
provided
for
.

CHAPTER
XLV
*NL*
*NL*
At
about
the
week
's
end
from
his
return
to
Mansfield
,
Tom
's
immediate
*NL*
danger
was
over
,
and
he
was
so
far
pronounced
safe
as
to
make
his
mother
*NL*
perfectly
easy
;
for
being
now
used
to
the
sight
of
him
in
his
suffering
,
*NL*
helpless
state
,
and
hearing
only
the
best
,
and
never
thinking
beyond
*NL*
what
she
heard
,
with
no
disposition
for
alarm
and
no
aptitude
at
a
hint
,
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
was
the
happiest
subject
in
the
world
for
a
little
medical
*NL*
imposition
.
The
fever
was
subdued
;
the
fever
had
been
his
complaint
;
*NL*
of
course
he
would
soon
be
well
again
.
Lady
Bertram
could
think
nothing
*NL*
less
,
and
Fanny
shared
her
aunt
's
security
,
till
she
received
a
few
*NL*
lines
from
Edmund
,
written
purposely
to
give
her
a
clearer
idea
of
his
*NL*
brother
's
situation
,
and
acquaint
her
with
the
apprehensions
which
*NL*
he
and
his
father
had
imbibed
from
the
physician
with
respect
to
some
*NL*
strong
hectic
symptoms
,
which
seemed
to
seize
the
frame
on
the
departure
*NL*
of
the
fever
.
They
judged
it
best
that
Lady
Bertram
should
not
be
*NL*
harassed
by
alarms
which
,
it
was
to
be
hoped
,
would
prove
unfounded
;
*NL*
but
there
was
no
reason
why
Fanny
should
not
know
the
truth
.
They
were
*NL*
apprehensive
for
his
lungs
.
*NL*
*NL*
A
very
few
lines
from
Edmund
shewed
her
the
patient
and
the
sickroom
*NL*
in
a
juster
and
stronger
light
than
all
Lady
Bertram
's
sheets
of
paper
*NL*
could
do
.
There
was
hardly
any
one
in
the
house
who
might
not
have
*NL*
described
,
from
personal
observation
,
better
than
herself
;
not
one
who
*NL*
was
not
more
useful
at
times
to
her
son
.
She
could
do
nothing
but
glide
*NL*
in
quietly
and
look
at
him
;
but
when
able
to
talk
or
be
talked
to
,
or
*NL*
read
to
,
Edmund
was
the
companion
he
preferred
.
His
aunt
worried
him
by
*NL*
her
cares
,
and
Sir
Thomas
knew
not
how
to
bring
down
his
conversation
or
*NL*
his
voice
to
the
level
of
irritation
and
feebleness
.
Edmund
was
all
in
*NL*
all
.
Fanny
would
certainly
believe
him
so
at
least
,
and
must
find
that
*NL*
her
estimation
of
him
was
higher
than
ever
when
he
appeared
as
the
*NL*
attendant
,
supporter
,
cheerer
of
a
suffering
brother
.
There
was
not
only
*NL*
the
debility
of
recent
illness
to
assist
:
there
was
also
,
as
she
now
*NL*
learnt
,
nerves
much
affected
,
spirits
much
depressed
to
calm
and
raise
,
*NL*
and
her
own
imagination
added
that
there
must
be
a
mind
to
be
properly
*NL*
guided
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
family
were
not
consumptive
,
and
she
was
more
inclined
to
hope
than
*NL*
fear
for
her
cousin
,
except
when
she
thought
of
Miss
Crawford
;
but
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
gave
her
the
idea
of
being
the
child
of
good
luck
,
and
to
her
*NL*
selfishness
and
vanity
it
would
be
good
luck
to
have
Edmund
the
only
*NL*
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
Even
in
the
sick
chamber
the
fortunate
Mary
was
not
forgotten
.
Edmund
's
*NL*
letter
had
this
postscript
.
``
On
the
subject
of
my
last
,
I
had
actually
*NL*
begun
a
letter
when
called
away
by
Tom
's
illness
,
but
I
have
now
changed
*NL*
my
mind
,
and
fear
to
trust
the
influence
of
friends
.
When
Tom
is
better
,
*NL*
I
shall
go
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Such
was
the
state
of
Mansfield
,
and
so
it
continued
,
with
scarcely
any
*NL*
change
,
till
Easter
.
A
line
occasionally
added
by
Edmund
to
his
*NL*
mother
's
letter
was
enough
for
Fanny
's
information
.
Tom
's
amendment
was
*NL*
alarmingly
slow
.
*NL*
*NL*
Easter
came
particularly
late
this
year
,
as
Fanny
had
most
sorrowfully
*NL*
considered
,
on
first
learning
that
she
had
no
chance
of
leaving
*NL*
Portsmouth
till
after
it
.
It
came
,
and
she
had
yet
heard
nothing
of
her
*NL*
return
--
nothing
even
of
the
going
to
London
,
which
was
to
precede
*NL*
her
return
.
Her
aunt
often
expressed
a
wish
for
her
,
but
there
was
no
*NL*
notice
,
no
message
from
the
uncle
on
whom
all
depended
.
She
supposed
*NL*
he
could
not
yet
leave
his
son
,
but
it
was
a
cruel
,
a
terrible
delay
*NL*
to
her
.
The
end
of
April
was
coming
on
;
it
would
soon
be
almost
three
*NL*
months
,
instead
of
two
,
that
she
had
been
absent
from
them
all
,
and
that
*NL*
her
days
had
been
passing
in
a
state
of
penance
,
which
she
loved
them
*NL*
too
well
to
hope
they
would
thoroughly
understand
;
and
who
could
yet
say
*NL*
when
there
might
be
leisure
to
think
of
or
fetch
her
?
*NL*
*NL*
Her
eagerness
,
her
impatience
,
her
longings
to
be
with
them
,
were
such
*NL*
as
to
bring
a
line
or
two
of
Cowper
's
Tirocinium
for
ever
before
her
.
*NL*
``
With
what
intense
desire
she
wants
her
home
,
''
was
continually
on
her
*NL*
tongue
,
as
the
truest
description
of
a
yearning
which
she
could
not
*NL*
suppose
any
schoolboy
's
bosom
to
feel
more
keenly
.
*NL*
*NL*
When
she
had
been
coming
to
Portsmouth
,
she
had
loved
to
call
it
her
*NL*
home
,
had
been
fond
of
saying
that
she
was
going
home
;
the
word
had
*NL*
been
very
dear
to
her
,
and
so
it
still
was
,
but
it
must
be
applied
to
*NL*
Mansfield
.
_
That
_
was
now
the
home
.
Portsmouth
was
Portsmouth
;
Mansfield
*NL*
was
home
.
They
had
been
long
so
arranged
in
the
indulgence
of
her
secret
*NL*
meditations
,
and
nothing
was
more
consolatory
to
her
than
to
find
her
*NL*
aunt
using
the
same
language
:
``
I
can
not
but
say
I
much
regret
your
being
*NL*
from
home
at
this
distressing
time
,
so
very
trying
to
my
spirits
.
I
*NL*
trust
and
hope
,
and
sincerely
wish
you
may
never
be
absent
from
home
so
*NL*
long
again
,
''
were
most
delightful
sentences
to
her
.
Still
,
however
,
it
*NL*
was
her
private
regale
.
Delicacy
to
her
parents
made
her
careful
not
to
*NL*
betray
such
a
preference
of
her
uncle
's
house
.
It
was
always
:
``
When
I
go
*NL*
back
into
Northamptonshire
,
or
when
I
return
to
Mansfield
,
I
shall
do
*NL*
so
and
so
.
''
For
a
great
while
it
was
so
,
but
at
last
the
longing
grew
*NL*
stronger
,
it
overthrew
caution
,
and
she
found
herself
talking
of
what
*NL*
she
should
do
when
she
went
home
before
she
was
aware
.
She
reproached
*NL*
herself
,
coloured
,
and
looked
fearfully
towards
her
father
and
mother
.
*NL*
She
need
not
have
been
uneasy
.
There
was
no
sign
of
displeasure
,
or
even
*NL*
of
hearing
her
.
They
were
perfectly
free
from
any
jealousy
of
Mansfield
.
*NL*
She
was
as
welcome
to
wish
herself
there
as
to
be
there
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
sad
to
Fanny
to
lose
all
the
pleasures
of
spring
.
She
had
not
*NL*
known
before
what
pleasures
she
_
had
_
to
lose
in
passing
March
and
April
*NL*
in
a
town
.
She
had
not
known
before
how
much
the
beginnings
and
progress
*NL*
of
vegetation
had
delighted
her
.
What
animation
,
both
of
body
and
mind
,
*NL*
she
had
derived
from
watching
the
advance
of
that
season
which
can
not
,
*NL*
in
spite
of
its
capriciousness
,
be
unlovely
,
and
seeing
its
increasing
*NL*
beauties
from
the
earliest
flowers
in
the
warmest
divisions
of
her
*NL*
aunt
's
garden
,
to
the
opening
of
leaves
of
her
uncle
's
plantations
,
and
*NL*
the
glory
of
his
woods
.
To
be
losing
such
pleasures
was
no
trifle
;
to
*NL*
be
losing
them
,
because
she
was
in
the
midst
of
closeness
and
noise
,
*NL*
to
have
confinement
,
bad
air
,
bad
smells
,
substituted
for
liberty
,
*NL*
freshness
,
fragrance
,
and
verdure
,
was
infinitely
worse
:
but
even
these
*NL*
incitements
to
regret
were
feeble
,
compared
with
what
arose
from
the
*NL*
conviction
of
being
missed
by
her
best
friends
,
and
the
longing
to
be
*NL*
useful
to
those
who
were
wanting
her
!
*NL*
*NL*
Could
she
have
been
at
home
,
she
might
have
been
of
service
to
every
*NL*
creature
in
the
house
.
She
felt
that
she
must
have
been
of
use
to
all
.
*NL*
To
all
she
must
have
saved
some
trouble
of
head
or
hand
;
and
were
it
*NL*
only
in
supporting
the
spirits
of
her
aunt
Bertram
,
keeping
her
from
*NL*
the
evil
of
solitude
,
or
the
still
greater
evil
of
a
restless
,
officious
*NL*
companion
,
too
apt
to
be
heightening
danger
in
order
to
enhance
her
own
*NL*
importance
,
her
being
there
would
have
been
a
general
good
.
She
loved
to
*NL*
fancy
how
she
could
have
read
to
her
aunt
,
how
she
could
have
talked
to
*NL*
her
,
and
tried
at
once
to
make
her
feel
the
blessing
of
what
was
,
and
*NL*
prepare
her
mind
for
what
might
be
;
and
how
many
walks
up
and
down
*NL*
stairs
she
might
have
saved
her
,
and
how
many
messages
she
might
have
*NL*
carried
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
astonished
her
that
Tom
's
sisters
could
be
satisfied
with
remaining
*NL*
in
London
at
such
a
time
,
through
an
illness
which
had
now
,
under
*NL*
different
degrees
of
danger
,
lasted
several
weeks
.
_
They
_
might
return
*NL*
to
Mansfield
when
they
chose
;
travelling
could
be
no
difficulty
to
*NL*
_
them
_
,
and
she
could
not
comprehend
how
both
could
still
keep
away
.
*NL*
If
Mrs.
Rushworth
could
imagine
any
interfering
obligations
,
Julia
was
*NL*
certainly
able
to
quit
London
whenever
she
chose
.
It
appeared
from
one
*NL*
of
her
aunt
's
letters
that
Julia
had
offered
to
return
if
wanted
,
but
*NL*
this
was
all
.
It
was
evident
that
she
would
rather
remain
where
she
was
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
disposed
to
think
the
influence
of
London
very
much
at
war
*NL*
with
all
respectable
attachments
.
She
saw
the
proof
of
it
in
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
,
as
well
as
in
her
cousins
;
_
her
_
attachment
to
Edmund
had
been
*NL*
respectable
,
the
most
respectable
part
of
her
character
;
her
friendship
*NL*
for
herself
had
at
least
been
blameless
.
Where
was
either
sentiment
now
?
*NL*
It
was
so
long
since
Fanny
had
had
any
letter
from
her
,
that
she
had
*NL*
some
reason
to
think
lightly
of
the
friendship
which
had
been
so
dwelt
*NL*
on
.
It
was
weeks
since
she
had
heard
anything
of
Miss
Crawford
or
of
*NL*
her
other
connexions
in
town
,
except
through
Mansfield
,
and
she
was
*NL*
beginning
to
suppose
that
she
might
never
know
whether
Mr.
Crawford
had
*NL*
gone
into
Norfolk
again
or
not
till
they
met
,
and
might
never
hear
from
*NL*
his
sister
any
more
this
spring
,
when
the
following
letter
was
received
*NL*
to
revive
old
and
create
some
new
sensations
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
Forgive
me
,
my
dear
Fanny
,
as
soon
as
you
can
,
for
my
long
silence
,
and
*NL*
behave
as
if
you
could
forgive
me
directly
.
This
is
my
modest
request
*NL*
and
expectation
,
for
you
are
so
good
,
that
I
depend
upon
being
treated
*NL*
better
than
I
deserve
,
and
I
write
now
to
beg
an
immediate
answer
.
I
*NL*
want
to
know
the
state
of
things
at
Mansfield
Park
,
and
you
,
no
doubt
,
*NL*
are
perfectly
able
to
give
it
.
One
should
be
a
brute
not
to
feel
for
the
*NL*
distress
they
are
in
;
and
from
what
I
hear
,
poor
Mr.
Bertram
has
a
bad
*NL*
chance
of
ultimate
recovery
.
I
thought
little
of
his
illness
at
first
.
*NL*
I
looked
upon
him
as
the
sort
of
person
to
be
made
a
fuss
with
,
and
to
*NL*
make
a
fuss
himself
in
any
trifling
disorder
,
and
was
chiefly
concerned
*NL*
for
those
who
had
to
nurse
him
;
but
now
it
is
confidently
asserted
that
*NL*
he
is
really
in
a
decline
,
that
the
symptoms
are
most
alarming
,
and
that
*NL*
part
of
the
family
,
at
least
,
are
aware
of
it
.
If
it
be
so
,
I
am
sure
*NL*
you
must
be
included
in
that
part
,
that
discerning
part
,
and
therefore
*NL*
entreat
you
to
let
me
know
how
far
I
have
been
rightly
informed
.
I
need
*NL*
not
say
how
rejoiced
I
shall
be
to
hear
there
has
been
any
mistake
,
but
*NL*
the
report
is
so
prevalent
that
I
confess
I
can
not
help
trembling
.
To
*NL*
have
such
a
fine
young
man
cut
off
in
the
flower
of
his
days
is
most
*NL*
melancholy
.
Poor
Sir
Thomas
will
feel
it
dreadfully
.
I
really
am
quite
*NL*
agitated
on
the
subject
.
Fanny
,
Fanny
,
I
see
you
smile
and
look
cunning
,
*NL*
but
,
upon
my
honour
,
I
never
bribed
a
physician
in
my
life
.
Poor
young
*NL*
man
!
If
he
is
to
die
,
there
will
be
_
two
_
poor
young
men
less
in
the
*NL*
world
;
and
with
a
fearless
face
and
bold
voice
would
I
say
to
any
one
,
*NL*
that
wealth
and
consequence
could
fall
into
no
hands
more
deserving
of
*NL*
them
.
It
was
a
foolish
precipitation
last
Christmas
,
but
the
evil
of
*NL*
a
few
days
may
be
blotted
out
in
part
.
Varnish
and
gilding
hide
many
*NL*
stains
.
It
will
be
but
the
loss
of
the
Esquire
after
his
name
.
With
real
*NL*
affection
,
Fanny
,
like
mine
,
more
might
be
overlooked
.
Write
to
me
by
*NL*
return
of
post
,
judge
of
my
anxiety
,
and
do
not
trifle
with
it
.
Tell
me
*NL*
the
real
truth
,
as
you
have
it
from
the
fountainhead
.
And
now
,
do
*NL*
not
trouble
yourself
to
be
ashamed
of
either
my
feelings
or
your
own
.
*NL*
Believe
me
,
they
are
not
only
natural
,
they
are
philanthropic
and
*NL*
virtuous
.
I
put
it
to
your
conscience
,
whether
`
Sir
Edmund
'
would
not
do
*NL*
more
good
with
all
the
Bertram
property
than
any
other
possible
`
Sir
.
'
*NL*
Had
the
Grants
been
at
home
I
would
not
have
troubled
you
,
but
you
are
*NL*
now
the
only
one
I
can
apply
to
for
the
truth
,
his
sisters
not
being
*NL*
within
my
reach
.
Mrs.
R.
has
been
spending
the
Easter
with
the
Aylmers
*NL*
at
Twickenham
-LRB-
as
to
be
sure
you
know
-RRB-
,
and
is
not
yet
returned
;
and
*NL*
Julia
is
with
the
cousins
who
live
near
Bedford
Square
,
but
I
forget
*NL*
their
name
and
street
.
Could
I
immediately
apply
to
either
,
however
,
I
*NL*
should
still
prefer
you
,
because
it
strikes
me
that
they
have
all
along
*NL*
been
so
unwilling
to
have
their
own
amusements
cut
up
,
as
to
shut
their
*NL*
eyes
to
the
truth
.
I
suppose
Mrs.
R.
's
Easter
holidays
will
not
last
*NL*
much
longer
;
no
doubt
they
are
thorough
holidays
to
her
.
The
Aylmers
*NL*
are
pleasant
people
;
and
her
husband
away
,
she
can
have
nothing
but
*NL*
enjoyment
.
I
give
her
credit
for
promoting
his
going
dutifully
down
to
*NL*
Bath
,
to
fetch
his
mother
;
but
how
will
she
and
the
dowager
agree
in
one
*NL*
house
?
Henry
is
not
at
hand
,
so
I
have
nothing
to
say
from
him
.
Do
not
*NL*
you
think
Edmund
would
have
been
in
town
again
long
ago
,
but
for
this
*NL*
illness
?
--
Yours
ever
,
Mary
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
I
had
actually
begun
folding
my
letter
when
Henry
walked
in
,
but
he
*NL*
brings
no
intelligence
to
prevent
my
sending
it
.
Mrs.
R.
knows
a
decline
*NL*
is
apprehended
;
he
saw
her
this
morning
:
she
returns
to
Wimpole
Street
*NL*
to-day
;
the
old
lady
is
come
.
Now
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
with
any
*NL*
queer
fancies
because
he
has
been
spending
a
few
days
at
Richmond
.
He
*NL*
does
it
every
spring
.
Be
assured
he
cares
for
nobody
but
you
.
At
this
*NL*
very
moment
he
is
wild
to
see
you
,
and
occupied
only
in
contriving
the
*NL*
means
for
doing
so
,
and
for
making
his
pleasure
conduce
to
yours
.
In
*NL*
proof
,
he
repeats
,
and
more
eagerly
,
what
he
said
at
Portsmouth
about
*NL*
our
conveying
you
home
,
and
I
join
him
in
it
with
all
my
soul
.
Dear
*NL*
Fanny
,
write
directly
,
and
tell
us
to
come
.
It
will
do
us
all
good
.
*NL*
He
and
I
can
go
to
the
Parsonage
,
you
know
,
and
be
no
trouble
to
our
*NL*
friends
at
Mansfield
Park
.
It
would
really
be
gratifying
to
see
them
*NL*
all
again
,
and
a
little
addition
of
society
might
be
of
infinite
use
to
*NL*
them
;
and
as
to
yourself
,
you
must
feel
yourself
to
be
so
wanted
there
,
*NL*
that
you
can
not
in
conscience
--
conscientious
as
you
are
--
keep
away
,
when
*NL*
you
have
the
means
of
returning
.
I
have
not
time
or
patience
to
give
*NL*
half
Henry
's
messages
;
be
satisfied
that
the
spirit
of
each
and
every
*NL*
one
is
unalterable
affection
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
's
disgust
at
the
greater
part
of
this
letter
,
with
her
extreme
*NL*
reluctance
to
bring
the
writer
of
it
and
her
cousin
Edmund
together
,
*NL*
would
have
made
her
-LRB-
as
she
felt
-RRB-
incapable
of
judging
impartially
*NL*
whether
the
concluding
offer
might
be
accepted
or
not
.
To
herself
,
*NL*
individually
,
it
was
most
tempting
.
To
be
finding
herself
,
perhaps
*NL*
within
three
days
,
transported
to
Mansfield
,
was
an
image
of
the
*NL*
greatest
felicity
,
but
it
would
have
been
a
material
drawback
to
be
*NL*
owing
such
felicity
to
persons
in
whose
feelings
and
conduct
,
at
the
*NL*
present
moment
,
she
saw
so
much
to
condemn
:
the
sister
's
feelings
,
*NL*
the
brother
's
conduct
,
_
her
_
cold-hearted
ambition
,
_
his
_
thoughtless
*NL*
vanity
.
To
have
him
still
the
acquaintance
,
the
flirt
perhaps
,
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
!
She
was
mortified
.
She
had
thought
better
of
him
.
Happily
,
*NL*
however
,
she
was
not
left
to
weigh
and
decide
between
opposite
*NL*
inclinations
and
doubtful
notions
of
right
;
there
was
no
occasion
to
*NL*
determine
whether
she
ought
to
keep
Edmund
and
Mary
asunder
or
not
.
She
*NL*
had
a
rule
to
apply
to
,
which
settled
everything
.
Her
awe
of
her
uncle
,
*NL*
and
her
dread
of
taking
a
liberty
with
him
,
made
it
instantly
plain
to
*NL*
her
what
she
had
to
do
.
She
must
absolutely
decline
the
proposal
.
If
he
*NL*
wanted
,
he
would
send
for
her
;
and
even
to
offer
an
early
return
was
*NL*
a
presumption
which
hardly
anything
would
have
seemed
to
justify
.
She
*NL*
thanked
Miss
Crawford
,
but
gave
a
decided
negative
.
``
Her
uncle
,
*NL*
she
understood
,
meant
to
fetch
her
;
and
as
her
cousin
's
illness
had
*NL*
continued
so
many
weeks
without
her
being
thought
at
all
necessary
,
*NL*
she
must
suppose
her
return
would
be
unwelcome
at
present
,
and
that
she
*NL*
should
be
felt
an

representation

at

according

this

the
conquest

prejudice

CHAPTER
XLVI
*NL*
*NL*
As
Fanny
could
not
doubt
that
her
answer
was
conveying
a
real
*NL*
disappointment
,
she
was
rather
in
expectation
,
from
her
knowledge
of
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
temper
,
of
being
urged
again
;
and
though
no
second
*NL*
letter
arrived
for
the
space
of
a
week
,
she
had
still
the
same
feeling
*NL*
when
it
did
come
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
receiving
it
,
she
could
instantly
decide
on
its
containing
little
*NL*
writing
,
and
was
persuaded
of
its
having
the
air
of
a
letter
of
haste
*NL*
and
business
.
Its
object
was
unquestionable
;
and
two
moments
were
enough
*NL*
to
start
the
probability
of
its
being
merely
to
give
her
notice
that
*NL*
they
should
be
in
Portsmouth
that
very
day
,
and
to
throw
her
into
all
*NL*
the
agitation
of
doubting
what
she
ought
to
do
in
such
a
case
.
If
two
*NL*
moments
,
however
,
can
surround
with
difficulties
,
a
third
can
disperse
*NL*
them
;
and
before
she
had
opened
the
letter
,
the
possibility
of
Mr.
and
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
's
having
applied
to
her
uncle
and
obtained
his
permission
*NL*
was
giving
her
ease
.
This
was
the
letter
--
*NL*
*NL*
``
A
most
scandalous
,
ill-natured
rumour
has
just
reached
me
,
and
I
write
,
*NL*
dear
Fanny
,
to
warn
you
against
giving
the
least
credit
to
it
,
should
it
*NL*
spread
into
the
country
.
Depend
upon
it
,
there
is
some
mistake
,
and
that
*NL*
a
day
or
two
will
clear
it
up
;
at
any
rate
,
that
Henry
is
blameless
,
and
*NL*
in
spite
of
a
moment
's
_
etourderie
_
,
thinks
of
nobody
but
you
.
Say
not
a
*NL*
word
of
it
;
hear
nothing
,
surmise
nothing
,
whisper
nothing
till
I
*NL*
write
again
.
I
am
sure
it
will
be
all
hushed
up
,
and
nothing
proved
but
*NL*
Rushworth
's
folly
.
If
they
are
gone
,
I
would
lay
my
life
they
are
only
*NL*
gone
to
Mansfield
Park
,
and
Julia
with
them
.
But
why
would
not
you
let
*NL*
us
come
for
you
?
I
wish
you
may
not
repent
it
.
--
Yours
,
etc.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
stood
aghast
.
As
no
scandalous
,
ill-natured
rumour
had
reached
*NL*
her
,
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
understand
much
of
this
strange
*NL*
letter
.
She
could
only
perceive
that
it
must
relate
to
Wimpole
Street
*NL*
and
Mr.
Crawford
,
and
only
conjecture
that
something
very
imprudent
had
*NL*
just
occurred
in
that
quarter
to
draw
the
notice
of
the
world
,
and
to
*NL*
excite
her
jealousy
,
in
Miss
Crawford
's
apprehension
,
if
she
heard
it
.
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
need
not
be
alarmed
for
her
.
She
was
only
sorry
for
the
*NL*
parties
concerned
and
for
Mansfield
,
if
the
report
should
spread
so
far
;
*NL*
but
she
hoped
it
might
not
.
If
the
Rushworths
were
gone
themselves
to
*NL*
Mansfield
,
as
was
to
be
inferred
from
what
Miss
Crawford
said
,
it
was
*NL*
not
likely
that
anything
unpleasant
should
have
preceded
them
,
or
at
*NL*
least
should
make
any
impression
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
to
Mr.
Crawford
,
she
hoped
it
might
give
him
a
knowledge
of
his
own
*NL*
disposition
,
convince
him
that
he
was
not
capable
of
being
steadily
*NL*
attached
to
any
one
woman
in
the
world
,
and
shame
him
from
persisting
*NL*
any
longer
in
addressing
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
was
very
strange
!
She
had
begun
to
think
he
really
loved
her
,
and
to
*NL*
fancy
his
affection
for
her
something
more
than
common
;
and
his
sister
*NL*
still
said
that
he
cared
for
nobody
else
.
Yet
there
must
have
been
some
*NL*
marked
display
of
attentions
to
her
cousin
,
there
must
have
been
some
*NL*
strong
indiscretion
,
since
her
correspondent
was
not
of
a
sort
to
regard
*NL*
a
slight
one
.
*NL*
*NL*
Very
uncomfortable
she
was
,
and
must
continue
,
till
she
heard
from
*NL*
Miss
Crawford
again
.
It
was
impossible
to
banish
the
letter
from
her
*NL*
thoughts
,
and
she
could
not
relieve
herself
by
speaking
of
it
to
any
*NL*
human
being
.
Miss
Crawford
need
not
have
urged
secrecy
with
so
much
*NL*
warmth
;
she
might
have
trusted
to
her
sense
of
what
was
due
to
her
*NL*
cousin
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
next
day
came
and
brought
no
second
letter
.
Fanny
was
disappointed
.
*NL*
She
could
still
think
of
little
else
all
the
morning
;
but
,
when
her
*NL*
father
came
back
in
the
afternoon
with
the
daily
newspaper
as
usual
,
she
*NL*
was
so
far
from
expecting
any
elucidation
through
such
a
channel
that
*NL*
the
subject
was
for
a
moment
out
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
deep
in
other
musing
.
The
remembrance
of
her
first
evening
in
*NL*
that
room
,
of
her
father
and
his
newspaper
,
came
across
her
.
No
candle
*NL*
was
now
wanted
.
The
sun
was
yet
an
hour
and
half
above
the
horizon
.
She
*NL*
felt
that
she
had
,
indeed
,
been
three
months
there
;
and
the
sun
's
rays
*NL*
falling
strongly
into
the
parlour
,
instead
of
cheering
,
made
her
still
*NL*
more
melancholy
,
for
sunshine
appeared
to
her
a
totally
different
*NL*
thing
in
a
town
and
in
the
country
.
Here
,
its
power
was
only
a
glare
:
*NL*
a
stifling
,
sickly
glare
,
serving
but
to
bring
forward
stains
and
dirt
*NL*
that
might
otherwise
have
slept
.
There
was
neither
health
nor
gaiety
in
*NL*
sunshine
in
a
town
.
She
sat
in
a
blaze
of
oppressive
heat
,
in
a
cloud
*NL*
of
moving
dust
,
and
her
eyes
could
only
wander
from
the
walls
,
marked
by
*NL*
her
father
's
head
,
to
the
table
cut
and
notched
by
her
brothers
,
where
*NL*
stood
the
tea-board
never
thoroughly
cleaned
,
the
cups
and
saucers
wiped
*NL*
in
streaks
,
the
milk
a
mixture
of
motes
floating
in
thin
blue
,
and
the
*NL*
bread
and
butter
growing
every
minute
more
greasy
than
even
Rebecca
's
*NL*
hands
had
first
produced
it
.
Her
father
read
his
newspaper
,
and
her
*NL*
mother
lamented
over
the
ragged
carpet
as
usual
,
while
the
tea
was
*NL*
in
preparation
,
and
wished
Rebecca
would
mend
it
;
and
Fanny
was
first
*NL*
roused
by
his
calling
out
to
her
,
after
humphing
and
considering
over
*NL*
a
particular
paragraph
:
``
What
's
the
name
of
your
great
cousins
in
town
,
*NL*
Fan
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
A
moment
's
recollection
enabled
her
to
say
,
``
Rushworth
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
And
do
n't
they
live
in
Wimpole
Street
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
,
sir
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Then
,
there
's
the
devil
to
pay
among
them
,
that
's
all
!
There
''
-LRB-
holding
*NL*
out
the
paper
to
her
-RRB-
;
``
much
good
may
such
fine
relations
do
you
.
I
*NL*
do
n't
know
what
Sir
Thomas
may
think
of
such
matters
;
he
may
be
too
much
*NL*
of
the
courtier
and
fine
gentleman
to
like
his
daughter
the
less
.
But
,
*NL*
by
G
--
!
if
she
belonged
to
_
me
_
,
I
'd
give
her
the
rope
's
end
as
long
as
*NL*
I
could
stand
over
her
.
A
little
flogging
for
man
and
woman
too
would
be
*NL*
the
best
way
of
preventing
such
things
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
read
to
herself
that
``
it
was
with
infinite
concern
the
newspaper
*NL*
had
to
announce
to
the
world
a
matrimonial
_
fracas
_
in
the
family
of
*NL*
Mr.
R.
of
Wimpole
Street
;
the
beautiful
Mrs.
R.
,
whose
name
had
not
long
*NL*
been
enrolled
in
the
lists
of
Hymen
,
and
who
had
promised
to
become
*NL*
so
brilliant
a
leader
in
the
fashionable
world
,
having
quitted
her
*NL*
husband
's
roof
in
company
with
the
well-known
and
captivating
Mr.
C.
,
*NL*
the
intimate
friend
and
associate
of
Mr.
R.
,
and
it
was
not
known
even
*NL*
to
the
editor
of
the
newspaper
whither
they
were
gone
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
It
is
a
mistake
,
sir
,
''
said
Fanny
instantly
;
``
it
must
be
a
mistake
,
it
*NL*
can
not
be
true
;
it
must
mean
some
other
people
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
She
spoke
from
the
instinctive
wish
of
delaying
shame
;
she
spoke
with
*NL*
a
resolution
which
sprung
from
despair
,
for
she
spoke
what
she
did
not
,
*NL*
could
not
believe
herself
.
It
had
been
the
shock
of
conviction
as
she
*NL*
read
.
The
truth
rushed
on
her
;
and
how
she
could
have
spoken
at
all
,
*NL*
how
she
could
even
have
breathed
,
was
afterwards
matter
of
wonder
to
*NL*
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Price
cared
too
little
about
the
report
to
make
her
much
answer
.
*NL*
``
It
might
be
all
a
lie
,
''
he
acknowledged
;
``
but
so
many
fine
ladies
were
*NL*
going
to
the
devil
nowadays
that
way
,
that
there
was
no
answering
for
*NL*
anybody
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Indeed
,
I
hope
it
is
not
true
,
''
said
Mrs.
Price
plaintively
;
``
it
would
*NL*
be
so
very
shocking
!
If
I
have
spoken
once
to
Rebecca
about
that
carpet
,
*NL*
I
am
sure
I
have
spoke
at
least
a
dozen
times
;
have
not
I
,
Betsey
?
And
*NL*
it
would
not
be
ten
minutes
'
work
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
horror
of
a
mind
like
Fanny
's
,
as
it
received
the
conviction
of
such
*NL*
guilt
,
and
began
to
take
in
some
part
of
the
misery
that
must
ensue
,
can
*NL*
hardly
be
described
.
At
first
,
it
was
a
sort
of
stupefaction
;
but
every
*NL*
moment
was
quickening
her
perception
of
the
horrible
evil
.
She
could
not
*NL*
doubt
,
she
dared
not
indulge
a
hope
,
of
the
paragraph
being
false
.
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
letter
,
which
she
had
read
so
often
as
to
make
every
line
*NL*
her
own
,
was
in
frightful
conformity
with
it
.
Her
eager
defence
of
her
*NL*
brother
,
her
hope
of
its
being
_
hushed
_
_
up
_
,
her
evident
agitation
,
*NL*
were
all
of
a
piece
with
something
very
bad
;
and
if
there
was
a
woman
*NL*
of
character
in
existence
,
who
could
treat
as
a
trifle
this
sin
of
the
*NL*
first
magnitude
,
who
would
try
to
gloss
it
over
,
and
desire
to
have
it
*NL*
unpunished
,
she
could
believe
Miss
Crawford
to
be
the
woman
!
Now
she
*NL*
could
see
her
own
mistake
as
to
_
who
_
were
gone
,
or
_
said
_
to
be
*NL*
gone
.
It
was
not
Mr.
and
Mrs.
Rushworth
;
it
was
Mrs.
Rushworth
and
Mr.
*NL*
Crawford
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
seemed
to
herself
never
to
have
been
shocked
before
.
There
was
no
*NL*
possibility
of
rest
.
The
evening
passed
without
a
pause
of
misery
,
the
*NL*
night
was
totally
sleepless
.
She
passed
only
from
feelings
of
sickness
*NL*
to
shudderings
of
horror
;
and
from
hot
fits
of
fever
to
cold
.
The
event
*NL*
was
so
shocking
,
that
there
were
moments
even
when
her
heart
revolted
*NL*
from
it
as
impossible
:
when
she
thought
it
could
not
be
.
A
woman
married
*NL*
only
six
months
ago
;
a
man
professing
himself
devoted
,
even
_
engaged
_
to
*NL*
another
;
that
other
her
near
relation
;
the
whole
family
,
both
families
*NL*
connected
as
they
were
by
tie
upon
tie
;
all
friends
,
all
intimate
*NL*
together
!
It
was
too
horrible
a
confusion
of
guilt
,
too
gross
a
*NL*
complication
of
evil
,
for
human
nature
,
not
in
a
state
of
utter
*NL*
barbarism
,
to
be
capable
of
!
yet
her
judgment
told
her
it
was
so
.
*NL*
_
His
_
unsettled
affections
,
wavering
with
his
vanity
,
_
Maria
's
_
*NL*
decided
attachment
,
and
no
sufficient
principle
on
either
side
,
gave
it
*NL*
possibility
:
Miss
Crawford
's
letter
stampt
it
a
fact
.
*NL*
*NL*
What
would
be
the
consequence
?
Whom
would
it
not
injure
?
Whose
views
*NL*
might
it
not
affect
?
Whose
peace
would
it
not
cut
up
for
ever
?
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
,
herself
,
Edmund
;
but
it
was
dangerous
,
perhaps
,
to
tread
*NL*
such
ground
.
She
confined
herself
,
or
tried
to
confine
herself
,
to
the
*NL*
simple
,
indubitable
family
misery
which
must
envelop
all
,
if
it
were
*NL*
indeed
a
matter
of
certified
guilt
and
public
exposure
.
The
mother
's
*NL*
sufferings
,
the
father
's
;
there
she
paused
.
Julia
's
,
Tom
's
,
Edmund
's
;
*NL*
there
a
yet
longer
pause
.
They
were
the
two
on
whom
it
would
fall
most
*NL*
horribly
.
Sir
Thomas
's
parental
solicitude
and
high
sense
of
honour
and
*NL*
decorum
,
Edmund
's
upright
principles
,
unsuspicious
temper
,
and
genuine
*NL*
strength
of
feeling
,
made
her
think
it
scarcely
possible
for
them
to
*NL*
support
life
and
reason
under
such
disgrace
;
and
it
appeared
to
her
*NL*
that
,
as
far
as
this
world
alone
was
concerned
,
the
greatest
blessing
to
*NL*
every
one
of
kindred
with
Mrs.
Rushworth
would
be
instant
annihilation
.
*NL*
*NL*
Nothing
happened
the
next
day
,
or
the
next
,
to
weaken
her
terrors
.
Two
*NL*
posts
came
in
,
and
brought
no
refutation
,
public
or
private
.
There
was
*NL*
no
second
letter
to
explain
away
the
first
from
Miss
Crawford
;
there
was
*NL*
no
intelligence
from
Mansfield
,
though
it
was
now
full
time
for
her
*NL*
to
hear
again
from
her
aunt
.
This
was
an
evil
omen
.
She
had
,
indeed
,
*NL*
scarcely
the
shadow
of
a
hope
to
soothe
her
mind
,
and
was
reduced
to
so
*NL*
low
and
wan
and
trembling
a
condition
,
as
no
mother
,
not
unkind
,
except
*NL*
Mrs.
Price
could
have
overlooked
,
when
the
third
day
did
bring
the
*NL*
sickening
knock
,
and
a
letter
was
again
put
into
her
hands
.
It
bore
the
*NL*
London
postmark
,
and
came
from
Edmund
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Dear
Fanny
,
--
You
know
our
present
wretchedness
.
May
God
support
you
*NL*
under
your
share
!
We
have
been
here
two
days
,
but
there
is
nothing
to
*NL*
be
done
.
They
can
not
be
traced
.
You
may
not
have
heard
of
the
last
*NL*
blow
--
Julia
's
elopement
;
she
is
gone
to
Scotland
with
Yates
.
She
left
*NL*
London
a
few
hours
before
we
entered
it
.
At
any
other
time
this
would
*NL*
have
been
felt
dreadfully
.
Now
it
seems
nothing
;
yet
it
is
an
heavy
*NL*
aggravation
.
My
father
is
not
overpowered
.
More
can
not
be
hoped
.
He
is
*NL*
still
able
to
think
and
act
;
and
I
write
,
by
his
desire
,
to
propose
your
*NL*
returning
home
.
He
is
anxious
to
get
you
there
for
my
mother
's
sake
.
I
*NL*
shall
be
at
Portsmouth
the
morning
after
you
receive
this
,
and
hope
to
*NL*
find
you
ready
to
set
off
for
Mansfield
.
My
father
wishes
you
to
invite
*NL*
Susan
to
go
with
you
for
a
few
months
.
Settle
it
as
you
like
;
say
what
*NL*
is
proper
;
I
am
sure
you
will
feel
such
an
instance
of
his
kindness
at
*NL*
such
a
moment
!
Do
justice
to
his
meaning
,
however
I
may
confuse
it
.
You
*NL*
may
imagine
something
of
my
present
state
.
There
is
no
end
of
the
evil
*NL*
let
loose
upon
us
.
You
will
see
me
early
by
the
mail
.
--
Yours
,
etc.

*NL*
*NL*
Never
had
Fanny
more
wanted
a
cordial
.
Never
had
she
felt
such
a
one
*NL*
as
this
letter
contained
.
To-morrow
!
to
leave
Portsmouth
to-morrow
!
*NL*
She
was
,
she
felt
she
was
,
in
the
greatest
danger
of
being
exquisitely
*NL*
happy
,
while
so
many
were
miserable
.
The
evil
which
brought
such
good
*NL*
to
her
!
She
dreaded
lest
she
should
learn
to
be
insensible
of
it
.
To
be
*NL*
going
so
soon
,
sent
for
so
kindly
,
sent
for
as
a
comfort
,
and
with
leave
*NL*
to
take
Susan
,
was
altogether
such
a
combination
of
blessings
as
set
her
*NL*
heart
in
a
glow
,
and
for
a
time
seemed
to
distance
every
pain
,
and
*NL*
make
her
incapable
of
suitably
sharing
the
distress
even
of
those
*NL*
whose
distress
she
thought
of
most
.
Julia
's
elopement
could
affect
her
*NL*
comparatively
but
little
;
she
was
amazed
and
shocked
;
but
it
could
not
*NL*
occupy
her
,
could
not
dwell
on
her
mind
.
She
was
obliged
to
call
herself
*NL*
to
think
of
it
,
and
acknowledge
it
to
be
terrible
and
grievous
,
or
it
*NL*
was
escaping
her
,
in
the
midst
of
all
the
agitating
pressing
joyful
*NL*
cares
attending
this
summons
to
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
There
is
nothing
like
employment
,
active
indispensable
employment
,
for
*NL*
relieving
sorrow
.
Employment
,
even
melancholy
,
may
dispel
melancholy
,
*NL*
and
her
occupations
were
hopeful
.
She
had
so
much
to
do
,
that
not
even
*NL*
the
horrible
story
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
--
now
fixed
to
the
last
point
of
*NL*
certainty
could
affect
her
as
it
had
done
before
.
She
had
not
time
to
*NL*
be
miserable
.
Within
twenty-four
hours
she
was
hoping
to
be
gone
;
her
*NL*
father
and
mother
must
be
spoken
to
,
Susan
prepared
,
everything
got
*NL*
ready
.
Business
followed
business
;
the
day
was
hardly
long
enough
.
The
*NL*
happiness
she
was
imparting
,
too
,
happiness
very
little
alloyed
by
the
*NL*
black
communication
which
must
briefly
precede
it
--
the
joyful
consent
*NL*
of
her
father
and
mother
to
Susan
's
going
with
her
--
the
general
*NL*
satisfaction
with
which
the
going
of
both
seemed
regarded
,
and
the
*NL*
ecstasy
of
Susan
herself
,
was
all
serving
to
support
her
spirits
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
affliction
of
the
Bertrams
was
little
felt
in
the
family
.
Mrs.
Price
*NL*
talked
of
her
poor
sister
for
a
few
minutes
,
but
how
to
find
anything
to
*NL*
hold
Susan
's
clothes
,
because
Rebecca
took
away
all
the
boxes
and
spoilt
*NL*
them
,
was
much
more
in
her
thoughts
:
and
as
for
Susan
,
now
unexpectedly
*NL*
gratified
in
the
first
wish
of
her
heart
,
and
knowing
nothing
personally
*NL*
of
those
who
had
sinned
,
or
of
those
who
were
sorrowing
--
if
she
could
*NL*
help
rejoicing
from
beginning
to
end
,
it
was
as
much
as
ought
to
be
*NL*
expected
from
human
virtue
at
fourteen
.
*NL*
*NL*
As
nothing
was
really
left
for
the
decision
of
Mrs.
Price
,
or
the
good
*NL*
offices
of
Rebecca
,
everything
was
rationally
and
duly
accomplished
,
*NL*
and
the
girls
were
ready
for
the
morrow
.
The
advantage
of
much
sleep
*NL*
to
prepare
them
for
their
journey
was
impossible
.
The
cousin
who
was
*NL*
travelling
towards
them
could
hardly
have
less
than
visited
their
*NL*
agitated
spirits
--
one
all
happiness
,
the
other
all
varying
and
*NL*
indescribable
perturbation
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
eight
in
the
morning
Edmund
was
in
the
house
.
The
girls
heard
his
*NL*
entrance
from
above
,
and
Fanny
went
down
.
The
idea
of
immediately
seeing
*NL*
him
,
with
the
knowledge
of
what
he
must
be
suffering
,
brought
back
all
*NL*
her
own
first
feelings
.
He
so
near
her
,
and
in
misery
.
She
was
ready
to
*NL*
sink
as
she
entered
the
parlour
.
He
was
alone
,
and
met
her
instantly
;
*NL*
and
she
found
herself
pressed
to
his
heart
with
only
these
words
,
just
*NL*
articulate
,
``
My
Fanny
,
my
only
sister
;
my
only
comfort
now
!
''
She
could
*NL*
say
nothing
;
nor
for
some
minutes
could
he
say
more
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
turned
away
to
recover
himself
,
and
when
he
spoke
again
,
though
his
*NL*
voice
still
faltered
,
his
manner
shewed
the
wish
of
self-command
,
and
*NL*
the
resolution
of
avoiding
any
farther
allusion
.
``
Have
you
breakfasted
?
*NL*
When
shall
you
be
ready
?
Does
Susan
go
?
''
were
questions
following
each
*NL*
other
rapidly
.
His
great
object
was
to
be
off
as
soon
as
possible
.
When
*NL*
Mansfield
was
considered
,
time
was
precious
;
and
the
state
of
his
own
*NL*
mind
made
him
find
relief
only
in
motion
.
It
was
settled
that
he
should
*NL*
order
the
carriage
to
the
door
in
half
an
hour
.
Fanny
answered
for
their
*NL*
having
breakfasted
and
being
quite
ready
in
half
an
hour
.
He
had
already
*NL*
ate
,
and
declined
staying
for
their
meal
.
He
would
walk
round
the
*NL*
ramparts
,
and
join
them
with
the
carriage
.
He
was
gone
again
;
glad
to
*NL*
get
away
even
from
Fanny
.
*NL*
*NL*
He
looked
very
ill
;
evidently
suffering
under
violent
emotions
,
which
he
*NL*
was
determined
to
suppress
.
She
knew
it
must
be
so
,
but
it
was
terrible
*NL*
to
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
carriage
came
;
and
he
entered
the
house
again
at
the
same
*NL*
moment
,
just
in
time
to
spend
a
few
minutes
with
the
family
,
and
be
a
*NL*
witness
--
but
that
he
saw
nothing
--
of
the
tranquil
manner
in
which
the
*NL*
daughters
were
parted
with
,
and
just
in
time
to
prevent
their
sitting
*NL*
down
to
the
breakfast-table
,
which
,
by
dint
of
much
unusual
activity
,
*NL*
was
quite
and
completely
ready
as
the
carriage
drove
from
the
door
.
*NL*
Fanny
's
last
meal
in
her
father
's
house
was
in
character
with
her
first
:
*NL*
she
was
dismissed
from
it
as
hospitably
as
she
had
been
welcomed
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
her
heart
swelled
with
joy
and
gratitude
as
she
passed
the
barriers
*NL*
of
Portsmouth
,
and
how
Susan
's
face
wore
its
broadest
smiles
,
may
be
*NL*
easily
conceived
.
Sitting
forwards
,
however
,
and
screened
by
her
bonnet
,
*NL*
those
smiles
were
unseen
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
journey
was
likely
to
be
a
silent
one
.
Edmund
's
deep
sighs
often
*NL*
reached
Fanny
.
Had
he
been
alone
with
her
,
his
heart
must
have
opened
*NL*
in
spite
of
every
resolution
;
but
Susan
's
presence
drove
him
quite
into
*NL*
himself
,
and
his
attempts
to
talk
on
indifferent
subjects
could
never
be
*NL*
long
supported
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
watched
him
with
never-failing
solicitude
,
and
sometimes
catching
*NL*
his
eye
,
revived
an
affectionate
smile
,
which
comforted
her
;
but
the
*NL*
first
day
's
journey
passed
without
her
hearing
a
word
from
him
on
the
*NL*
subjects
that
were
weighing
him
down
.
The
next
morning
produced
a
*NL*
little
more
.
Just
before
their
setting
out
from
Oxford
,
while
Susan
was
*NL*
stationed
at
a
window
,
in
eager
observation
of
the
departure
of
a
*NL*
large
family
from
the
inn
,
the
other
two
were
standing
by
the
fire
;
and
*NL*
Edmund
,
particularly
struck
by
the
alteration
in
Fanny
's
looks
,
and
from
*NL*
his
ignorance
of
the
daily
evils
of
her
father
's
house
,
attributing
an
*NL*
undue
share
of
the
change
,
attributing
_
all
_
to
the
recent
event
,
took
*NL*
her
hand
,
and
said
in
a
low
,
but
very
expressive
tone
,
``
No
wonder
--
you
*NL*
must
feel
it
--
you
must
suffer
.
How
a
man
who
had
once
loved
,
could
*NL*
desert
you
!
But
_
yours
_
--
your
regard
was
new
compared
with
--
Fanny
,
*NL*
think
of
_
me
_
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
The
first
division
of
their
journey
occupied
a
long
day
,
and
brought
*NL*
them
,
almost
knocked
up
,
to
Oxford
;
but
the
second
was
over
at
a
much
*NL*
earlier
hour
.
They
were
in
the
environs
of
Mansfield
long
before
the
*NL*
usual
dinner-time
,
and
as
they
approached
the
beloved
place
,
the
hearts
*NL*
of
both
sisters
sank
a
little
.
Fanny
began
to
dread
the
meeting
with
her
*NL*
aunts
and
Tom
,
under
so
dreadful
a
humiliation
;
and
Susan
to
feel
*NL*
with
some
anxiety
,
that
all
her
best
manners
,
all
her
lately
acquired
*NL*
knowledge
of
what
was
practised
here
,
was
on
the
point
of
being
called
*NL*
into
action
.
Visions
of
good
and
ill
breeding
,
of
old
vulgarisms
and
new
*NL*
gentilities
,
were
before
her
;
and
she
was
meditating
much
upon
silver
*NL*
forks
,
napkins
,
and
finger-glasses
.
Fanny
had
been
everywhere
awake
to
*NL*
the
difference
of
the
country
since
February
;
but
when
they
entered
the
*NL*
Park
her
perceptions
and
her
pleasures
were
of
the
keenest
sort
.
It
was
*NL*
three
months
,
full
three
months
,
since
her
quitting
it
,
and
the
*NL*
change
was
from
winter
to
summer
.
Her
eye
fell
everywhere
on
lawns
*NL*
and
plantations
of
the
freshest
green
;
and
the
trees
,
though
not
fully
*NL*
clothed
,
were
in
that
delightful
state
when
farther
beauty
is
known
to
*NL*
be
at
hand
,
and
when
,
while
much
is
actually
given
to
the
sight
,
more
*NL*
yet
remains
for
the
imagination
.
Her
enjoyment
,
however
,
was
for
herself
*NL*
alone
.
Edmund
could
not
share
it
.
She
looked
at
him
,
but
he
was
leaning
*NL*
back
,
sunk
in
a
deeper
gloom
than
ever
,
and
with
eyes
closed
,
as
if
the
*NL*
view
of
cheerfulness
oppressed
him
,
and
the
lovely
scenes
of
home
must
*NL*
be
shut
out
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
made
her
melancholy
again
;
and
the
knowledge
of
what
must
be
enduring
*NL*
there
,
invested
even
the
house
,
modern
,
airy
,
and
well
situated
as
it
*NL*
was
,
with
a
melancholy
aspect
.
*NL*
*NL*
By
one
of
the
suffering
party
within
they
were
expected
with
such
*NL*
impatience
as
she
had
never
known
before
.
Fanny
had
scarcely
passed
the
*NL*
solemn-looking
servants
,
when
Lady
Bertram
came
from
the
drawing-room
*NL*
to
meet
her
;
came
with
no
indolent
step
;
and
falling
on
her
neck
,
said
,
*NL*
``
Dear
Fanny
!
now
I
shall
be
comfortable
.

CHAPTER
XLVII
*NL*
*NL*
It
had
been
a
miserable
party
,
each
of
the
three
believing
themselves
*NL*
most
miserable
.
Mrs.
Norris
,
however
,
as
most
attached
to
Maria
,
was
*NL*
really
the
greatest
sufferer
.
Maria
was
her
first
favourite
,
the
dearest
*NL*
of
all
;
the
match
had
been
her
own
contriving
,
as
she
had
been
wont
with
*NL*
such
pride
of
heart
to
feel
and
say
,
and
this
conclusion
of
it
almost
*NL*
overpowered
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
an
altered
creature
,
quieted
,
stupefied
,
indifferent
to
*NL*
everything
that
passed
.
The
being
left
with
her
sister
and
nephew
,
and
*NL*
all
the
house
under
her
care
,
had
been
an
advantage
entirely
thrown
*NL*
away
;
she
had
been
unable
to
direct
or
dictate
,
or
even
fancy
herself
*NL*
useful
.
When
really
touched
by
affliction
,
her
active
powers
had
been
*NL*
all
benumbed
;
and
neither
Lady
Bertram
nor
Tom
had
received
from
her
the
*NL*
smallest
support
or
attempt
at
support
.
She
had
done
no
more
for
them
*NL*
than
they
had
done
for
each
other
.
They
had
been
all
solitary
,
helpless
,
*NL*
and
forlorn
alike
;
and
now
the
arrival
of
the
others
only
established
*NL*
her
superiority
in
wretchedness
.
Her
companions
were
relieved
,
but
there
*NL*
was
no
good
for
_
her
_
.
Edmund
was
almost
as
welcome
to
his
brother
*NL*
as
Fanny
to
her
aunt
;
but
Mrs.
Norris
,
instead
of
having
comfort
from
*NL*
either
,
was
but
the
more
irritated
by
the
sight
of
the
person
whom
,
in
*NL*
the
blindness
of
her
anger
,
she
could
have
charged
as
the
daemon
of
the
*NL*
piece
.
Had
Fanny
accepted
Mr.
Crawford
this
could
not
have
happened
.
*NL*
*NL*
Susan
too
was
a
grievance
.
She
had
not
spirits
to
notice
her
in
more
*NL*
than
a
few
repulsive
looks
,
but
she
felt
her
as
a
spy
,
and
an
intruder
,
*NL*
and
an
indigent
niece
,
and
everything
most
odious
.
By
her
other
aunt
,
*NL*
Susan
was
received
with
quiet
kindness
.
Lady
Bertram
could
not
give
her
*NL*
much
time
,
or
many
words
,
but
she
felt
her
,
as
Fanny
's
sister
,
to
have
*NL*
a
claim
at
Mansfield
,
and
was
ready
to
kiss
and
like
her
;
and
Susan
*NL*
was
more
than
satisfied
,
for
she
came
perfectly
aware
that
nothing
but
*NL*
ill-humour
was
to
be
expected
from
aunt
Norris
;
and
was
so
provided
*NL*
with
happiness
,
so
strong
in
that
best
of
blessings
,
an
escape
from
*NL*
many
certain
evils
,
that
she
could
have
stood
against
a
great
deal
more
*NL*
indifference
than
she
met
with
from
the
others
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
now
left
a
good
deal
to
herself
,
to
get
acquainted
with
the
*NL*
house
and
grounds
as
she
could
,
and
spent
her
days
very
happily
in
so
*NL*
doing
,
while
those
who
might
otherwise
have
attended
to
her
were
shut
*NL*
up
,
or
wholly
occupied
each
with
the
person
quite
dependent
on
them
,
at
*NL*
this
time
,
for
everything
like
comfort
;
Edmund
trying
to
bury
his
own
*NL*
feelings
in
exertions
for
the
relief
of
his
brother
's
,
and
Fanny
devoted
*NL*
to
her
aunt
Bertram
,
returning
to
every
former
office
with
more
than
*NL*
former
zeal
,
and
thinking
she
could
never
do
enough
for
one
who
seemed
*NL*
so
much
to
want
her
.
*NL*
*NL*
To
talk
over
the
dreadful
business
with
Fanny
,
talk
and
lament
,
was
all
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
's
consolation
.
To
be
listened
to
and
borne
with
,
and
hear
*NL*
the
voice
of
kindness
and
sympathy
in
return
,
was
everything
that
could
*NL*
be
done
for
her
.
To
be
otherwise
comforted
was
out
of
the
question
.
The
*NL*
case
admitted
of
no
comfort
.
Lady
Bertram
did
not
think
deeply
,
but
,
*NL*
guided
by
Sir
Thomas
,
she
thought
justly
on
all
important
points
;
and
*NL*
she
saw
,
therefore
,
in
all
its
enormity
,
what
had
happened
,
and
neither
*NL*
endeavoured
herself
,
nor
required
Fanny
to
advise
her
,
to
think
little
*NL*
of
guilt
and
infamy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Her
affections
were
not
acute
,
nor
was
her
mind
tenacious
.
After
a
time
,
*NL*
Fanny
found
it
not
impossible
to
direct
her
thoughts
to
other
subjects
,
*NL*
and
revive
some
interest
in
the
usual
occupations
;
but
whenever
Lady
*NL*
Bertram
_
was
_
fixed
on
the
event
,
she
could
see
it
only
in
one
light
,
as
*NL*
comprehending
the
loss
of
a
daughter
,
and
a
disgrace
never
to
be
wiped
*NL*
off
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
learnt
from
her
all
the
particulars
which
had
yet
transpired
.
Her
*NL*
aunt
was
no
very
methodical
narrator
,
but
with
the
help
of
some
letters
*NL*
to
and
from
Sir
Thomas
,
and
what
she
already
knew
herself
,
and
could
*NL*
reasonably
combine
,
she
was
soon
able
to
understand
quite
as
much
as
she
*NL*
wished
of
the
circumstances
attending
the
story
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
had
gone
,
for
the
Easter
holidays
,
to
Twickenham
,
with
*NL*
a
family
whom
she
had
just
grown
intimate
with
:
a
family
of
lively
,
*NL*
agreeable
manners
,
and
probably
of
morals
and
discretion
to
suit
,
for
to
*NL*
_
their
_
house
Mr.
Crawford
had
constant
access
at
all
times
.
His
having
*NL*
been
in
the
same
neighbourhood
Fanny
already
knew
.
Mr.
Rushworth
had
*NL*
been
gone
at
this
time
to
Bath
,
to
pass
a
few
days
with
his
mother
,
and
*NL*
bring
her
back
to
town
,
and
Maria
was
with
these
friends
without
any
*NL*
restraint
,
without
even
Julia
;
for
Julia
had
removed
from
Wimpole
Street
*NL*
two
or
three
weeks
before
,
on
a
visit
to
some
relations
of
Sir
Thomas
;
*NL*
a
removal
which
her
father
and
mother
were
now
disposed
to
attribute
*NL*
to
some
view
of
convenience
on
Mr.
Yates
's
account
.
Very
soon
after
the
*NL*
Rushworths
'
return
to
Wimpole
Street
,
Sir
Thomas
had
received
a
letter
*NL*
from
an
old
and
most
particular
friend
in
London
,
who
hearing
and
*NL*
witnessing
a
good
deal
to
alarm
him
in
that
quarter
,
wrote
to
recommend
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
's
coming
to
London
himself
,
and
using
his
influence
with
his
*NL*
daughter
to
put
an
end
to
the
intimacy
which
was
already
exposing
her
to
*NL*
unpleasant
remarks
,
and
evidently
making
Mr.
Rushworth
uneasy
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
was
preparing
to
act
upon
this
letter
,
without
communicating
*NL*
its
contents
to
any
creature
at
Mansfield
,
when
it
was
followed
by
*NL*
another
,
sent
express
from
the
same
friend
,
to
break
to
him
the
almost
*NL*
desperate
situation
in
which
affairs
then
stood
with
the
young
people
.
*NL*
Mrs.
Rushworth
had
left
her
husband
's
house
:
Mr.
Rushworth
had
been
*NL*
in
great
anger
and
distress
to
_
him
_
-LRB-
Mr.
Harding
-RRB-
for
his
advice
;
Mr.
*NL*
Harding
feared
there
had
been
_
at
_
_
least
_
very
flagrant
indiscretion
.
*NL*
The
maidservant
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
senior
,
threatened
alarmingly
.
He
*NL*
was
doing
all
in
his
power
to
quiet
everything
,
with
the
hope
of
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
's
return
,
but
was
so
much
counteracted
in
Wimpole
Street
by
*NL*
the
influence
of
Mr.
Rushworth
's
mother
,
that
the
worst
consequences
*NL*
might
be
apprehended
.
*NL*
*NL*
This
dreadful
communication
could
not
be
kept
from
the
rest
of
the
*NL*
family
.
Sir
Thomas
set
off
,
Edmund
would
go
with
him
,
and
the
others
had
*NL*
been
left
in
a
state
of
wretchedness
,
inferior
only
to
what
followed
*NL*
the
receipt
of
the
next
letters
from
London
.
Everything
was
by
that
time
*NL*
public
beyond
a
hope
.
The
servant
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
the
mother
,
had
*NL*
exposure
in
her
power
,
and
supported
by
her
mistress
,
was
not
to
be
*NL*
silenced
.
The
two
ladies
,
even
in
the
short
time
they
had
been
*NL*
together
,
had
disagreed
;
and
the
bitterness
of
the
elder
against
her
*NL*
daughter-in-law
might
perhaps
arise
almost
as
much
from
the
personal
*NL*
disrespect
with
which
she
had
herself
been
treated
as
from
sensibility
*NL*
for
her
son
.
*NL*
*NL*
However
that
might
be
,
she
was
unmanageable
.
But
had
she
been
less
*NL*
obstinate
,
or
of
less
weight
with
her
son
,
who
was
always
guided
by
the
*NL*
last
speaker
,
by
the
person
who
could
get
hold
of
and
shut
him
up
,
the
*NL*
case
would
still
have
been
hopeless
,
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
did
not
appear
*NL*
again
,
and
there
was
every
reason
to
conclude
her
to
be
concealed
*NL*
somewhere
with
Mr.
Crawford
,
who
had
quitted
his
uncle
's
house
,
as
for
a
*NL*
journey
,
on
the
very
day
of
her
absenting
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
however
,
remained
yet
a
little
longer
in
town
,
in
the
hope
*NL*
of
discovering
and
snatching
her
from
farther
vice
,
though
all
was
lost
*NL*
on
the
side
of
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
_
His
_
present
state
Fanny
could
hardly
bear
to
think
of
.
There
was
but
*NL*
one
of
his
children
who
was
not
at
this
time
a
source
of
misery
to
*NL*
him
.
Tom
's
complaints
had
been
greatly
heightened
by
the
shock
of
his
*NL*
sister
's
conduct
,
and
his
recovery
so
much
thrown
back
by
it
,
that
even
*NL*
Lady
Bertram
had
been
struck
by
the
difference
,
and
all
her
alarms
were
*NL*
regularly
sent
off
to
her
husband
;
and
Julia
's
elopement
,
the
additional
*NL*
blow
which
had
met
him
on
his
arrival
in
London
,
though
its
force
had
*NL*
been
deadened
at
the
moment
,
must
,
she
knew
,
be
sorely
felt
.
She
saw
*NL*
that
it
was
.
His
letters
expressed
how
much
he
deplored
it
.
Under
any
*NL*
circumstances
it
would
have
been
an
unwelcome
alliance
;
but
to
have
it
*NL*
so
clandestinely
formed
,
and
such
a
period
chosen
for
its
completion
,
*NL*
placed
Julia
's
feelings
in
a
most
unfavourable
light
,
and
severely
*NL*
aggravated
the
folly
of
her
choice
.
He
called
it
a
bad
thing
,
done
in
*NL*
the
worst
manner
,
and
at
the
worst
time
;
and
though
Julia
was
yet
as
*NL*
more
pardonable
than
Maria
as
folly
than
vice
,
he
could
not
but
*NL*
regard
the
step
she
had
taken
as
opening
the
worst
probabilities
of
a
*NL*
conclusion
hereafter
like
her
sister
's
.
Such
was
his
opinion
of
the
set
*NL*
into
which
she
had
thrown
herself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
felt
for
him
most
acutely
.
He
could
have
no
comfort
but
in
Edmund
.
*NL*
Every
other
child
must
be
racking
his
heart
.
His
displeasure
against
*NL*
herself
she
trusted
,
reasoning
differently
from
Mrs.
Norris
,
would
now
*NL*
be
done
away
.
_
She
_
should
be
justified
.
Mr.
Crawford
would
have
fully
*NL*
acquitted
her
conduct
in
refusing
him
;
but
this
,
though
most
material
*NL*
to
herself
,
would
be
poor
consolation
to
Sir
Thomas
.
Her
uncle
's
*NL*
displeasure
was
terrible
to
her
;
but
what
could
her
justification
or
her
*NL*
gratitude
and
attachment
do
for
him
?
His
stay
must
be
on
Edmund
alone
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
mistaken
,
however
,
in
supposing
that
Edmund
gave
his
father
no
*NL*
present
pain
.
It
was
of
a
much
less
poignant
nature
than
what
the
others
*NL*
excited
;
but
Sir
Thomas
was
considering
his
happiness
as
very
deeply
*NL*
involved
in
the
offence
of
his
sister
and
friend
;
cut
off
by
it
,
as
*NL*
he
must
be
,
from
the
woman
whom
he
had
been
pursuing
with
undoubted
*NL*
attachment
and
strong
probability
of
success
;
and
who
,
in
everything
but
*NL*
this
despicable
brother
,
would
have
been
so
eligible
a
connexion
.
He
was
*NL*
aware
of
what
Edmund
must
be
suffering
on
his
own
behalf
,
in
addition
*NL*
to
all
the
rest
,
when
they
were
in
town
:
he
had
seen
or
conjectured
*NL*
his
feelings
;
and
,
having
reason
to
think
that
one
interview
with
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
had
taken
place
,
from
which
Edmund
derived
only
increased
*NL*
distress
,
had
been
as
anxious
on
that
account
as
on
others
to
get
him
*NL*
out
of
town
,
and
had
engaged
him
in
taking
Fanny
home
to
her
aunt
,
with
*NL*
a
view
to
his
relief
and
benefit
,
no
less
than
theirs
.
Fanny
was
not
in
*NL*
the
secret
of
her
uncle
's
feelings
,
Sir
Thomas
not
in
the
secret
of
Miss
*NL*
Crawford
's
character
.
Had
he
been
privy
to
her
conversation
with
his
*NL*
son
,
he
would
not
have
wished
her
to
belong
to
him
,
though
her
twenty
*NL*
thousand
pounds
had
been
forty
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Edmund
must
be
for
ever
divided
from
Miss
Crawford
did
not
admit
*NL*
of
a
doubt
with
Fanny
;
and
yet
,
till
she
knew
that
he
felt
the
same
,
her
*NL*
own
conviction
was
insufficient
.
She
thought
he
did
,
but
she
wanted
to
*NL*
be
assured
of
it
.
If
he
would
now
speak
to
her
with
the
unreserve
which
*NL*
had
sometimes
been
too
much
for
her
before
,
it
would
be
most
consoling
;
*NL*
but
_
that
_
she
found
was
not
to
be
.
She
seldom
saw
him
:
never
alone
.
He
*NL*
probably
avoided
being
alone
with
her
.
What
was
to
be
inferred
?
That
*NL*
his
judgment
submitted
to
all
his
own
peculiar
and
bitter
share
of
this
*NL*
family
affliction
,
but
that
it
was
too
keenly
felt
to
be
a
subject
of
*NL*
the
slightest
communication
.
This
must
be
his
state
.
He
yielded
,
but
it
*NL*
was
with
agonies
which
did
not
admit
of
speech
.
Long
,
long
would
it
be
*NL*
ere
Miss
Crawford
's
name
passed
his
lips
again
,
or
she
could
hope
for
a
*NL*
renewal
of
such
confidential
intercourse
as
had
been
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
_
was
_
long
.
They
reached
Mansfield
on
Thursday
,
and
it
was
not
till
*NL*
Sunday
evening
that
Edmund
began
to
talk
to
her
on
the
subject
.
Sitting
*NL*
with
her
on
Sunday
evening
--
a
wet
Sunday
evening
--
the
very
time
of
*NL*
all
others
when
,
if
a
friend
is
at
hand
,
the
heart
must
be
opened
,
and
*NL*
everything
told
;
no
one
else
in
the
room
,
except
his
mother
,
who
,
*NL*
after
hearing
an
affecting
sermon
,
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
,
it
was
*NL*
impossible
not
to
speak
;
and
so
,
with
the
usual
beginnings
,
hardly
to
*NL*
be
traced
as
to
what
came
first
,
and
the
usual
declaration
that
if
she
*NL*
would
listen
to
him
for
a
few
minutes
,
he
should
be
very
brief
,
and
*NL*
certainly
never
tax
her
kindness
in
the
same
way
again
;
she
need
not
*NL*
fear
a
repetition
;
it
would
be
a
subject
prohibited
entirely
:
he
entered
*NL*
upon
the
luxury
of
relating
circumstances
and
sensations
of
the
first
*NL*
interest
to
himself
,
to
one
of
whose
affectionate
sympathy
he
was
quite
*NL*
convinced
.
*NL*
*NL*
How
Fanny
listened
,
with
what
curiosity
and
concern
,
what
pain
and
what
*NL*
delight
,
how
the
agitation
of
his
voice
was
watched
,
and
how
carefully
*NL*
her
own
eyes
were
fixed
on
any
object
but
himself
,
may
be
imagined
.
The
*NL*
opening
was
alarming
.
He
had
seen
Miss
Crawford
.
He
had
been
invited
to
*NL*
see
her
.
He
had
received
a
note
from
Lady
Stornaway
to
beg
him
to
call
;
*NL*
and
regarding
it
as
what
was
meant
to
be
the
last
,
last
interview
*NL*
of
friendship
,
and
investing
her
with
all
the
feelings
of
shame
and
*NL*
wretchedness
which
Crawford
's
sister
ought
to
have
known
,
he
had
gone
to
*NL*
her
in
such
a
state
of
mind
,
so
softened
,
so
devoted
,
as
made
it
for
a
*NL*
few
moments
impossible
to
Fanny
's
fears
that
it
should
be
the
last
.
But
*NL*
as
he
proceeded
in
his
story
,
these
fears
were
over
.
She
had
met
him
,
*NL*
he
said
,
with
a
serious
--
certainly
a
serious
--
even
an
agitated
air
;
*NL*
but
before
he
had
been
able
to
speak
one
intelligible
sentence
,
she
had
*NL*
introduced
the
subject
in
a
manner
which
he
owned
had
shocked
him
.
''
'
I
*NL*
heard
you
were
in
town
,
'
said
she
;
'
I
wanted
to
see
you
.
Let
us
talk
*NL*
over
this
sad
business
.
What
can
equal
the
folly
of
our
two
relations
?
'
*NL*
I
could
not
answer
,
but
I
believe
my
looks
spoke
.
She
felt
reproved
.
*NL*
Sometimes
how
quick
to
feel
!
With
a
graver
look
and
voice
she
then
*NL*
added
,
'
I
do
not
mean
to
defend
Henry
at
your
sister
's
expense
.
'
So
*NL*
she
began
,
but
how
she
went
on
,
Fanny
,
is
not
fit
,
is
hardly
fit
to
be
*NL*
repeated
to
you
.
I
can
not
recall
all
her
words
.
I
would
not
dwell
upon
*NL*
them
if
I
could
.
Their
substance
was
great
anger
at
the
_
folly
_
of
each
.
*NL*
She
reprobated
her
brother
's
folly
in
being
drawn
on
by
a
woman
whom
he
*NL*
had
never
cared
for
,
to
do
what
must
lose
him
the
woman
he
adored
;
but
*NL*
still
more
the
folly
of
poor
Maria
,
in
sacrificing
such
a
situation
,
*NL*
plunging
into
such
difficulties
,
under
the
idea
of
being
really
loved
*NL*
by
a
man
who
had
long
ago
made
his
indifference
clear
.
Guess
what
I
must
*NL*
have
felt
.
To
hear
the
woman
whom
--
no
harsher
name
than
folly
given
!
*NL*
So
voluntarily
,
so
freely
,
so
coolly
to
canvass
it
!
No
reluctance
,
no
*NL*
horror
,
no
feminine
,
shall
I
say
,
no
modest
loathings
?
This
is
what
the
*NL*
world
does
.
For
where
,
Fanny
,
shall
we
find
a
woman
whom
nature
had
so
*NL*
richly
endowed
?
Spoilt
,
spoilt
!
''
*NL*
*NL*
After
a
little
reflection
,
he
went
on
with
a
sort
of
desperate
calmness
.
*NL*
``
I
will
tell
you
everything
,
and
then
have
done
for
ever
.
She
saw
it
*NL*
only
as
folly
,
and
that
folly
stamped
only
by
exposure
.
The
want
of
*NL*
common
discretion
,
of
caution
:
his
going
down
to
Richmond
for
the
whole
*NL*
time
of
her
being
at
Twickenham
;
her
putting
herself
in
the
power
of
*NL*
a
servant
;
it
was
the
detection
,
in
short
--
oh
,
Fanny
!
it
was
the
*NL*
detection
,
not
the
offence
,
which
she
reprobated
.
It
was
the
imprudence
*NL*
which
had
brought
things
to
extremity
,
and
obliged
her
brother
to
give
*NL*
up
every
dearer
plan
in
order
to
fly
with
her
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
He
stopt
.
``
And
what
,
''
said
Fanny
-LRB-
believing
herself
required
to
speak
-RRB-
,
*NL*
``
what
could
you
say
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Nothing
,
nothing
to
be
understood
.
I
was
like
a
man
stunned
.
She
*NL*
went
on
,
began
to
talk
of
you
;
yes
,
then
she
began
to
talk
of
you
,
*NL*
regretting
,
as
well
she
might
,
the
loss
of
such
a
--
.
There
she
spoke
*NL*
very
rationally
.
But
she
has
always
done
justice
to
you
.
`
He
has
thrown
*NL*
away
,
'
said
she
,
`
such
a
woman
as
he
will
never
see
again
.
She
would
*NL*
have
fixed
him
;
she
would
have
made
him
happy
for
ever
.
'
My
dearest
*NL*
Fanny
,
I
am
giving
you
,
I
hope
,
more
pleasure
than
pain
by
this
*NL*
retrospect
of
what
might
have
been
--
but
what
never
can
be
now
.
You
do
*NL*
not
wish
me
to
be
silent
?
If
you
do
,
give
me
but
a
look
,
a
word
,
and
I
*NL*
have
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
No
look
or
word
was
given
.
*NL*
*NL*
``
Thank
God
,
''
said
he
.
``
We
were
all
disposed
to
wonder
,
but
it
seems
to
*NL*
have
been
the
merciful
appointment
of
Providence
that
the
heart
which
*NL*
knew
no
guile
should
not
suffer
.
She
spoke
of
you
with
high
praise
and
*NL*
warm
affection
;
yet
,
even
here
,
there
was
alloy
,
a
dash
of
evil
;
for
in
*NL*
the
midst
of
it
she
could
exclaim
,
`
Why
would
not
she
have
him
?
It
is
*NL*
all
her
fault
.
Simple
girl
!
I
shall
never
forgive
her
.
Had
she
accepted
*NL*
him
as
she
ought
,
they
might
now
have
been
on
the
point
of
marriage
,
and
*NL*
Henry
would
have
been
too
happy
and
too
busy
to
want
any
other
object
.
*NL*
He
would
have
taken
no
pains
to
be
on
terms
with
Mrs.
Rushworth
again
.
*NL*
It
would
have
all
ended
in
a
regular
standing
flirtation
,
in
yearly
*NL*
meetings
at
Sotherton
and
Everingham
.
'
Could
you
have
believed
it
*NL*
possible
?
But
the
charm
is
broken
.
My
eyes
are
opened
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruel
!
''
said
Fanny
,
``
quite
cruel
.
At
such
a
moment
to
give
way
to
*NL*
gaiety
,
to
speak
with
lightness
,
and
to
you
!
Absolute
cruelty
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Cruelty
,
do
you
call
it
?
We
differ
there
.
No
,
hers
is
not
a
cruel
*NL*
nature
.
I
do
not
consider
her
as
meaning
to
wound
my
feelings
.
The
evil
*NL*
lies
yet
deeper
:
in
her
total
ignorance
,
unsuspiciousness
of
there
being
*NL*
such
feelings
;
in
a
perversion
of
mind
which
made
it
natural
to
her
to
*NL*
treat
the
subject
as
she
did
.
She
was
speaking
only
as
she
had
been
used
*NL*
to
hear
others
speak
,
as
she
imagined
everybody
else
would
speak
.
Hers
*NL*
are
not
faults
of
temper
.
She
would
not
voluntarily
give
unnecessary
*NL*
pain
to
any
one
,
and
though
I
may
deceive
myself
,
I
can
not
but
think
*NL*
that
for
me
,
for
my
feelings
,
she
would
--
Hers
are
faults
of
principle
,
*NL*
Fanny
;
of
blunted
delicacy
and
a
corrupted
,
vitiated
mind
.
Perhaps
it
*NL*
is
best
for
me
,
since
it
leaves
me
so
little
to
regret
.
Not
so
,
however
.
*NL*
Gladly
would
I
submit
to
all
the
increased
pain
of
losing
her
,
rather
*NL*
than
have
to
think
of
her
as
I
do
.
I
told
her
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Did
you
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Yes
;
when
I
left
her
I
told
her
so
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
How
long
were
you
together
?
''
*NL*
*NL*
``
Five-and-twenty
minutes
.
Well
,
she
went
on
to
say
that
what
remained
*NL*
now
to
be
done
was
to
bring
about
a
marriage
between
them
.
She
spoke
of
*NL*
it
,
Fanny
,
with
a
steadier
voice
than
I
can
.
''
He
was
obliged
to
pause
*NL*
more
than
once
as
he
continued
.
''
`
We
must
persuade
Henry
to
marry
*NL*
her
,
'
said
she
;
`
and
what
with
honour
,
and
the
certainty
of
having
shut
*NL*
himself
out
for
ever
from
Fanny
,
I
do
not
despair
of
it
.
Fanny
he
must
*NL*
give
up
.
I
do
not
think
that
even
_
he
_
could
now
hope
to
succeed
with
*NL*
one
of
her
stamp
,
and
therefore
I
hope
we
may
find
no
insuperable
*NL*
difficulty
.
My
influence
,
which
is
not
small
shall
all
go
that
way
;
and
*NL*
when
once
married
,
and
properly
supported
by
her
own
family
,
people
of
*NL*
respectability
as
they
are
,
she
may
recover
her
footing
in
society
to
a
*NL*
certain
degree
.
In
some
circles
,
we
know
,
she
would
never
be
admitted
,
*NL*
but
with
good
dinners
,
and
large
parties
,
there
will
always
be
those
*NL*
who
will
be
glad
of
her
acquaintance
;
and
there
is
,
undoubtedly
,
more
*NL*
liberality
and
candour
on
those
points
than
formerly
.
What
I
advise
*NL*
is
,
that
your
father
be
quiet
.
Do
not
let
him
injure
his
own
cause
by
*NL*
interference
.
Persuade
him
to
let
things
take
their
course
.
If
by
any
*NL*
officious
exertions
of
his
,
she
is
induced
to
leave
Henry
's
protection
,
*NL*
there
will
be
much
less
chance
of
his
marrying
her
than
if
she
remain
*NL*
with
him
.
I
know
how
he
is
likely
to
be
influenced
.
Let
Sir
Thomas
trust
*NL*
to
his
honour
and
compassion
,
and
it
may
all
end
well
;
but
if
he
get
his
*NL*
daughter
away
,
it
will
be
destroying
the
chief
hold
.

''
*NL*
*NL*
After
repeating
this
,
Edmund
was
so
much
affected
that
Fanny
,
watching
*NL*
him
with
silent
,
but
most
tender
concern
,
was
almost
sorry
that
the
*NL*
subject
had
been
entered
on
at
all
.
It
was
long
before
he
could
speak
*NL*
again
.
At
last
,
``
Now
,
Fanny
,
''
said
he
,
``
I
shall
soon
have
done
.
I
have
*NL*
told
you
the
substance
of
all
that
she
said
.
As
soon
as
I
could
speak
,
*NL*
I
replied
that
I
had
not
supposed
it
possible
,
coming
in
such
a
state
of
*NL*
mind
into
that
house
as
I
had
done
,
that
anything
could
occur
to
make
*NL*
me
suffer
more
,
but
that
she
had
been
inflicting
deeper
wounds
in
almost
*NL*
every
sentence
.
That
though
I
had
,
in
the
course
of
our
acquaintance
,
*NL*
been
often
sensible
of
some
difference
in
our
opinions
,
on
points
,
*NL*
too
,
of
some
moment
,
it
had
not
entered
my
imagination
to
conceive
the
*NL*
difference
could
be
such
as
she
had
now
proved
it
.
That
the
manner
in
*NL*
which
she
treated
the
dreadful
crime
committed
by
her
brother
and
my
*NL*
sister
-LRB-
with
whom
lay
the
greater
seduction
I
pretended
not
to
say
-RRB-
,
*NL*
but
the
manner
in
which
she
spoke
of
the
crime
itself
,
giving
it
every
*NL*
reproach
but
the
right
;
considering
its
ill
consequences
only
as
they
*NL*
were
to
be
braved
or
overborne
by
a
defiance
of
decency
and
impudence
in
*NL*
wrong
;
and
last
of
all
,
and
above
all
,
recommending
to
us
a
compliance
,
*NL*
a
compromise
,
an
acquiescence
in
the
continuance
of
the
sin
,
on
the
*NL*
chance
of
a
marriage
which
,
thinking
as
I
now
thought
of
her
brother
,
*NL*
should
rather
be
prevented
than
sought
;
all
this
together
most
*NL*
grievously
convinced
me
that
I
had
never
understood
her
before
,
and
*NL*
that
,
as
far
as
related
to
mind
,
it
had
been
the
creature
of
my
own
*NL*
imagination
,
not
Miss
Crawford
,
that
I
had
been
too
apt
to
dwell
on
*NL*
for
many
months
past
.
That
,
perhaps
,
it
was
best
for
me
;
I
had
less
to
*NL*
regret
in
sacrificing
a
friendship
,
feelings
,
hopes
which
must
,
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
have
been
torn
from
me
now
.
And
yet
,
that
I
must
and
would
confess
*NL*
that
,
could
I
have
restored
her
to
what
she
had
appeared
to
me
before
,
*NL*
I
would
infinitely
prefer
any
increase
of
the
pain
of
parting
,
for
the
*NL*
sake
of
carrying
with
me
the
right
of
tenderness
and
esteem
.
This
is
*NL*
what
I
said
,
the
purport
of
it
;
but
,
as
you
may
imagine
,
not
spoken
*NL*
so
collectedly
or
methodically
as
I
have
repeated
it
to
you
.
She
was
*NL*
astonished
,
exceedingly
astonished
--
more
than
astonished
.
I
saw
her
*NL*
change
countenance
.
She
turned
extremely
red
.
I
imagined
I
saw
a
*NL*
mixture
of
many
feelings
:
a
great
,
though
short
struggle
;
half
a
wish
of
*NL*
yielding
to
truths
,
half
a
sense
of
shame
,
but
habit
,
habit
carried
*NL*
it
.
She
would
have
laughed
if
she
could
.
It
was
a
sort
of
laugh
,
as
she
*NL*
answered
,
'
A
pretty
good
lecture
,
upon
my
word
.
Was
it
part
of
your
last
*NL*
sermon
?
At
this
rate
you
will
soon
reform
everybody
at
Mansfield
and
*NL*
Thornton
Lacey
;
and
when
I
hear
of
you
next
,
it
may
be
as
a
celebrated
*NL*
preacher
in
some
great
society
of
Methodists
,
or
as
a
missionary
into
*NL*
foreign
parts
.
'
She
tried
to
speak
carelessly
,
but
she
was
not
so
*NL*
careless
as
she
wanted
to
appear
.
I
only
said
in
reply
,
that
from
my
*NL*
heart
I
wished
her
well
,
and
earnestly
hoped
that
she
might
soon
learn
*NL*
to
think
more
justly
,
and
not
owe
the
most
valuable
knowledge
we
could
*NL*
any
of
us
acquire
,
the
knowledge
of
ourselves
and
of
our
duty
,
to
the
*NL*
lessons
of
affliction
,
and
immediately
left
the
room
.
I
had
gone
a
few
*NL*
steps
,
Fanny
,
when
I
heard
the
door
open
behind
me
.
`
Mr.
Bertram
,
'
said
*NL*
she
.
I
looked
back
.
`
Mr.
Bertram
,
'
said
she
,
with
a
smile
;
but
it
was
*NL*
a
smile
ill-suited
to
the
conversation
that
had
passed
,
a
saucy
playful
*NL*
smile
,
seeming
to
invite
in
order
to
subdue
me
;
at
least
it
appeared
so
*NL*
to
me
.
I
resisted
;
it
was
the
impulse
of
the
moment
to
resist
,
and
still
*NL*
walked
on
.
I
have
since
,
sometimes
,
for
a
moment
,
regretted
that
I
did
*NL*
not
go
back
,
but
I
know
I
was
right
,
and
such
has
been
the
end
of
our
*NL*
acquaintance
.
And
what
an
acquaintance
has
it
been
!
How
have
I
been
*NL*
deceived
!
Equally
in
brother
and
sister
deceived
!
I
thank
you
for
your
*NL*
patience
,
Fanny
.
This
has
been
the
greatest
relief
,
and
now
we
will
have
*NL*
done
.
''
*NL*
*NL*
And
such
was
Fanny
's
dependence
on
his
words
,
that
for
five
minutes
*NL*
she
thought
they
_
had
_
done
.
Then
,
however
,
it
all
came
on
again
,
or
*NL*
something
very
like
it
,
and
nothing
less
than
Lady
Bertram
's
rousing
*NL*
thoroughly
up
could
really
close
such
a
conversation
.
Till
that
*NL*
happened
,
they
continued
to
talk
of
Miss
Crawford
alone
,
and
how
she
had
*NL*
attached
him
,
and
how
delightful
nature
had
made
her
,
and
how
excellent
*NL*
she
would
have
been
,
had
she
fallen
into
good
hands
earlier
.
Fanny
,
now
*NL*
at
liberty
to
speak
openly
,
felt
more
than
justified
in
adding
to
*NL*
his
knowledge
of
her
real
character
,
by
some
hint
of
what
share
his
*NL*
brother
's
state
of
health
might
be
supposed
to
have
in
her
wish
for
a
*NL*
complete
reconciliation
.
This
was
not
an
agreeable
intimation
.
Nature
*NL*
resisted
it
for
a
while
.
It
would
have
been
a
vast
deal
pleasanter
to
*NL*
have
had
her
more
disinterested
in
her
attachment
;
but
his
vanity
was
*NL*
not
of
a
strength
to
fight
long
against
reason
.
He
submitted
to
believe
*NL*
that
Tom
's
illness
had
influenced
her
,
only
reserving
for
himself
this
*NL*
consoling
thought
,
that
considering
the
many
counteractions
of
opposing
*NL*
habits
,
she
had
certainly
been
_
more
_
attached
to
him
than
could
have
*NL*
been
expected
,
and
for
his
sake
been
more
near
doing
right
.
Fanny
*NL*
thought
exactly
the
same
;
and
they
were
also
quite
agreed
in
their
*NL*
opinion
of
the
lasting
effect
,
the
indelible
impression
,
which
such
*NL*
a
disappointment
must
make
on
his
mind
.
Time
would
undoubtedly
abate
*NL*
somewhat
of
his
sufferings
,
but
still
it
was
a
sort
of
thing
which
he
*NL*
never
could
get
entirely
the
better
of
;
and
as
to
his
ever
meeting
with
*NL*
any
other
woman
who
could
--
it
was
too
impossible
to
be
named
but
with
*NL*
indignation
.
Fanny
's
friendship
was
all
that
he
had
to
cling
to
.

CHAPTER
XLVIII
*NL*
*NL*
Let
other
pens
dwell
on
guilt
and
misery
.
I
quit
such
odious
subjects
*NL*
as
soon
as
I
can
,
impatient
to
restore
everybody
,
not
greatly
in
fault
*NL*
themselves
,
to
tolerable
comfort
,
and
to
have
done
with
all
the
rest
.
*NL*
*NL*
My
Fanny
,
indeed
,
at
this
very
time
,
I
have
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
,
*NL*
must
have
been
happy
in
spite
of
everything
.
She
must
have
been
a
happy
*NL*
creature
in
spite
of
all
that
she
felt
,
or
thought
she
felt
,
for
the
*NL*
distress
of
those
around
her
.
She
had
sources
of
delight
that
must
force
*NL*
their
way
.
She
was
returned
to
Mansfield
Park
,
she
was
useful
,
she
was
*NL*
beloved
;
she
was
safe
from
Mr.
Crawford
;
and
when
Sir
Thomas
came
back
*NL*
she
had
every
proof
that
could
be
given
in
his
then
melancholy
state
of
*NL*
spirits
,
of
his
perfect
approbation
and
increased
regard
;
and
happy
as
*NL*
all
this
must
make
her
,
she
would
still
have
been
happy
without
any
of
*NL*
it
,
for
Edmund
was
no
longer
the
dupe
of
Miss
Crawford
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
is
true
that
Edmund
was
very
far
from
happy
himself
.
He
was
suffering
*NL*
from
disappointment
and
regret
,
grieving
over
what
was
,
and
wishing
for
*NL*
what
could
never
be
.
She
knew
it
was
so
,
and
was
sorry
;
but
it
was
with
*NL*
a
sorrow
so
founded
on
satisfaction
,
so
tending
to
ease
,
and
so
much
in
*NL*
harmony
with
every
dearest
sensation
,
that
there
are
few
who
might
not
*NL*
have
been
glad
to
exchange
their
greatest
gaiety
for
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Sir
Thomas
,
poor
Sir
Thomas
,
a
parent
,
and
conscious
of
errors
in
his
*NL*
own
conduct
as
a
parent
,
was
the
longest
to
suffer
.
He
felt
that
he
*NL*
ought
not
to
have
allowed
the
marriage
;
that
his
daughter
's
sentiments
*NL*
had
been
sufficiently
known
to
him
to
render
him
culpable
in
authorising
*NL*
it
;
that
in
so
doing
he
had
sacrificed
the
right
to
the
expedient
,
and
*NL*
been
governed
by
motives
of
selfishness
and
worldly
wisdom
.
These
were
*NL*
reflections
that
required
some
time
to
soften
;
but
time
will
do
almost
*NL*
everything
;
and
though
little
comfort
arose
on
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
side
for
*NL*
the
misery
she
had
occasioned
,
comfort
was
to
be
found
greater
than
*NL*
he
had
supposed
in
his
other
children
.
Julia
's
match
became
a
less
*NL*
desperate
business
than
he
had
considered
it
at
first
.
She
was
humble
,
*NL*
and
wishing
to
be
forgiven
;
and
Mr.
Yates
,
desirous
of
being
really
*NL*
received
into
the
family
,
was
disposed
to
look
up
to
him
and
be
guided
.
*NL*
He
was
not
very
solid
;
but
there
was
a
hope
of
his
becoming
less
*NL*
trifling
,
of
his
being
at
least
tolerably
domestic
and
quiet
;
and
at
any
*NL*
rate
,
there
was
comfort
in
finding
his
estate
rather
more
,
and
his
debts
*NL*
much
less
,
than
he
had
feared
,
and
in
being
consulted
and
treated
as
*NL*
the
friend
best
worth
attending
to
.
There
was
comfort
also
in
Tom
,
who
*NL*
gradually
regained
his
health
,
without
regaining
the
thoughtlessness
and
*NL*
selfishness
of
his
previous
habits
.
He
was
the
better
for
ever
for
his
*NL*
illness
.
He
had
suffered
,
and
he
had
learned
to
think
:
two
advantages
*NL*
that
he
had
never
known
before
;
and
the
self-reproach
arising
from
the
*NL*
deplorable
event
in
Wimpole
Street
,
to
which
he
felt
himself
accessory
*NL*
by
all
the
dangerous
intimacy
of
his
unjustifiable
theatre
,
made
an
*NL*
impression
on
his
mind
which
,
at
the
age
of
six-and-twenty
,
with
no
want
*NL*
of
sense
or
good
companions
,
was
durable
in
its
happy
effects
.
He
became
*NL*
what
he
ought
to
be
:
useful
to
his
father
,
steady
and
quiet
,
and
not
*NL*
living
merely
for
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
was
comfort
indeed
!
and
quite
as
soon
as
Sir
Thomas
could
place
*NL*
dependence
on
such
sources
of
good
,
Edmund
was
contributing
to
his
*NL*
father
's
ease
by
improvement
in
the
only
point
in
which
he
had
given
*NL*
him
pain
before
--
improvement
in
his
spirits
.
After
wandering
about
and
*NL*
sitting
under
trees
with
Fanny
all
the
summer
evenings
,
he
had
so
well
*NL*
talked
his
mind
into
submission
as
to
be
very
tolerably
cheerful
again
.
*NL*
*NL*
These
were
the
circumstances
and
the
hopes
which
gradually
brought
their
*NL*
alleviation
to
Sir
Thomas
,
deadening
his
sense
of
what
was
lost
,
and
*NL*
in
part
reconciling
him
to
himself
;
though
the
anguish
arising
from
the
*NL*
conviction
of
his
own
errors
in
the
education
of
his
daughters
was
never
*NL*
to
be
entirely
done
away
.
*NL*
*NL*
Too
late
he
became
aware
how
unfavourable
to
the
character
of
any
young
*NL*
people
must
be
the
totally
opposite
treatment
which
Maria
and
Julia
had
*NL*
been
always
experiencing
at
home
,
where
the
excessive
indulgence
and
*NL*
flattery
of
their
aunt
had
been
continually
contrasted
with
his
own
*NL*
severity
.
He
saw
how
ill
he
had
judged
,
in
expecting
to
counteract
what
*NL*
was
wrong
in
Mrs.
Norris
by
its
reverse
in
himself
;
clearly
saw
that
he
*NL*
had
but
increased
the
evil
by
teaching
them
to
repress
their
spirits
in
*NL*
his
presence
so
as
to
make
their
real
disposition
unknown
to
him
,
and
*NL*
sending
them
for
all
their
indulgences
to
a
person
who
had
been
able
to
*NL*
attach
them
only
by
the
blindness
of
her
affection
,
and
the
excess
of
*NL*
her
praise
.
*NL*
*NL*
Here
had
been
grievous
mismanagement
;
but
,
bad
as
it
was
,
he
gradually
*NL*
grew
to
feel
that
it
had
not
been
the
most
direful
mistake
in
his
plan
*NL*
of
education
.
Something
must
have
been
wanting
_
within
_
,
or
time
would
*NL*
have
worn
away
much
of
its
ill
effect
.
He
feared
that
principle
,
active
*NL*
principle
,
had
been
wanting
;
that
they
had
never
been
properly
taught
*NL*
to
govern
their
inclinations
and
tempers
by
that
sense
of
duty
which
can
*NL*
alone
suffice
.
They
had
been
instructed
theoretically
in
their
religion
,
*NL*
but
never
required
to
bring
it
into
daily
practice
.
To
be
distinguished
*NL*
for
elegance
and
accomplishments
,
the
authorised
object
of
their
youth
,
*NL*
could
have
had
no
useful
influence
that
way
,
no
moral
effect
on
the
*NL*
mind
.
He
had
meant
them
to
be
good
,
but
his
cares
had
been
directed
to
*NL*
the
understanding
and
manners
,
not
the
disposition
;
and
of
the
necessity
*NL*
of
self-denial
and
humility
,
he
feared
they
had
never
heard
from
any
*NL*
lips
that
could
profit
them
.
*NL*
*NL*
Bitterly
did
he
deplore
a
deficiency
which
now
he
could
scarcely
*NL*
comprehend
to
have
been
possible
.
Wretchedly
did
he
feel
,
that
with
all
*NL*
the
cost
and
care
of
an
anxious
and
expensive
education
,
he
had
brought
*NL*
up
his
daughters
without
their
understanding
their
first
duties
,
or
his
*NL*
being
acquainted
with
their
character
and
temper
.
*NL*
*NL*
The
high
spirit
and
strong
passions
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
especially
,
were
*NL*
made
known
to
him
only
in
their
sad
result
.
She
was
not
to
be
prevailed
*NL*
on
to
leave
Mr.
Crawford
.
She
hoped
to
marry
him
,
and
they
continued
*NL*
together
till
she
was
obliged
to
be
convinced
that
such
hope
was
vain
,
*NL*
and
till
the
disappointment
and
wretchedness
arising
from
the
conviction
*NL*
rendered
her
temper
so
bad
,
and
her
feelings
for
him
so
like
hatred
,
*NL*
as
to
make
them
for
a
while
each
other
's
punishment
,
and
then
induce
a
*NL*
voluntary
separation
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
lived
with
him
to
be
reproached
as
the
ruin
of
all
his
happiness
*NL*
in
Fanny
,
and
carried
away
no
better
consolation
in
leaving
him
than
*NL*
that
she
_
had
_
divided
them
.
What
can
exceed
the
misery
of
such
a
mind
*NL*
in
such
a
situation
?
*NL*
*NL*
Mr.
Rushworth
had
no
difficulty
in
procuring
a
divorce
;
and
so
ended
a
*NL*
marriage
contracted
under
such
circumstances
as
to
make
any
better
end
*NL*
the
effect
of
good
luck
not
to
be
reckoned
on
.
She
had
despised
him
,
*NL*
and
loved
another
;
and
he
had
been
very
much
aware
that
it
was
so
.
The
*NL*
indignities
of
stupidity
,
and
the
disappointments
of
selfish
passion
,
*NL*
can
excite
little
pity
.
His
punishment
followed
his
conduct
,
as
did
a
*NL*
deeper
punishment
the
deeper
guilt
of
his
wife
.
_
He
_
was
released
from
*NL*
the
engagement
to
be
mortified
and
unhappy
,
till
some
other
pretty
girl
*NL*
could
attract
him
into
matrimony
again
,
and
he
might
set
forward
on
a
*NL*
second
,
and
,
it
is
to
be
hoped
,
more
prosperous
trial
of
the
state
:
if
*NL*
duped
,
to
be
duped
at
least
with
good
humour
and
good
luck
;
while
she
*NL*
must
withdraw
with
infinitely
stronger
feelings
to
a
retirement
and
*NL*
reproach
which
could
allow
no
second
spring
of
hope
or
character
.
*NL*
*NL*
Where
she
could
be
placed
became
a
subject
of
most
melancholy
and
*NL*
momentous
consultation
.
Mrs.
Norris
,
whose
attachment
seemed
to
augment
*NL*
with
the
demerits
of
her
niece
,
would
have
had
her
received
at
home
*NL*
and
countenanced
by
them
all
.
Sir
Thomas
would
not
hear
of
it
;
and
Mrs.
*NL*
Norris
's
anger
against
Fanny
was
so
much
the
greater
,
from
considering
*NL*
_
her
_
residence
there
as
the
motive
.
She
persisted
in
placing
his
*NL*
scruples
to
_
her
_
account
,
though
Sir
Thomas
very
solemnly
assured
her
*NL*
that
,
had
there
been
no
young
woman
in
question
,
had
there
been
no
young
*NL*
person
of
either
sex
belonging
to
him
,
to
be
endangered
by
the
society
*NL*
or
hurt
by
the
character
of
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
he
would
never
have
offered
*NL*
so
great
an
insult
to
the
neighbourhood
as
to
expect
it
to
notice
her
.
*NL*
As
a
daughter
,
he
hoped
a
penitent
one
,
she
should
be
protected
by
him
,
*NL*
and
secured
in
every
comfort
,
and
supported
by
every
encouragement
to
do
*NL*
right
,
which
their
relative
situations
admitted
;
but
farther
than
_
that
_
*NL*
he
could
not
go
.
Maria
had
destroyed
her
own
character
,
and
he
would
*NL*
not
,
by
a
vain
attempt
to
restore
what
never
could
be
restored
,
by
*NL*
affording
his
sanction
to
vice
,
or
in
seeking
to
lessen
its
disgrace
,
be
*NL*
anywise
accessory
to
introducing
such
misery
in
another
man
's
family
as
*NL*
he
had
known
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
It
ended
in
Mrs.
Norris
's
resolving
to
quit
Mansfield
and
devote
herself
*NL*
to
her
unfortunate
Maria
,
and
in
an
establishment
being
formed
for
them
*NL*
in
another
country
,
remote
and
private
,
where
,
shut
up
together
with
*NL*
little
society
,
on
one
side
no
affection
,
on
the
other
no
judgment
,
*NL*
it
may
be
reasonably
supposed
that
their
tempers
became
their
mutual
*NL*
punishment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Norris
's
removal
from
Mansfield
was
the
great
supplementary
comfort
*NL*
of
Sir
Thomas
's
life
.
His
opinion
of
her
had
been
sinking
from
the
day
*NL*
of
his
return
from
Antigua
:
in
every
transaction
together
from
that
*NL*
period
,
in
their
daily
intercourse
,
in
business
,
or
in
chat
,
she
had
*NL*
been
regularly
losing
ground
in
his
esteem
,
and
convincing
him
that
*NL*
either
time
had
done
her
much
disservice
,
or
that
he
had
considerably
*NL*
over-rated
her
sense
,
and
wonderfully
borne
with
her
manners
before
.
He
*NL*
had
felt
her
as
an
hourly
evil
,
which
was
so
much
the
worse
,
as
there
*NL*
seemed
no
chance
of
its
ceasing
but
with
life
;
she
seemed
a
part
of
*NL*
himself
that
must
be
borne
for
ever
.
To
be
relieved
from
her
,
therefore
,
*NL*
was
so
great
a
felicity
that
,
had
she
not
left
bitter
remembrances
*NL*
behind
her
,
there
might
have
been
danger
of
his
learning
almost
to
*NL*
approve
the
evil
which
produced
such
a
good
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
was
regretted
by
no
one
at
Mansfield
.
She
had
never
been
able
to
*NL*
attach
even
those
she
loved
best
;
and
since
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
elopement
,
*NL*
her
temper
had
been
in
a
state
of
such
irritation
as
to
make
her
*NL*
everywhere
tormenting
.
Not
even
Fanny
had
tears
for
aunt
Norris
,
not
*NL*
even
when
she
was
gone
for
ever
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
Julia
escaped
better
than
Maria
was
owing
,
in
some
measure
,
to
a
*NL*
favourable
difference
of
disposition
and
circumstance
,
but
in
a
greater
*NL*
to
her
having
been
less
the
darling
of
that
very
aunt
,
less
flattered
*NL*
and
less
spoilt
.
Her
beauty
and
acquirements
had
held
but
a
second
*NL*
place
.
She
had
been
always
used
to
think
herself
a
little
inferior
to
*NL*
Maria
.
Her
temper
was
naturally
the
easiest
of
the
two
;
her
feelings
,
*NL*
though
quick
,
were
more
controllable
,
and
education
had
not
given
her
so
*NL*
very
hurtful
a
degree
of
self-consequence
.
*NL*
*NL*
She
had
submitted
the
best
to
the
disappointment
in
Henry
Crawford
.
*NL*
After
the
first
bitterness
of
the
conviction
of
being
slighted
was
over
,
*NL*
she
had
been
tolerably
soon
in
a
fair
way
of
not
thinking
of
him
again
;
*NL*
and
when
the
acquaintance
was
renewed
in
town
,
and
Mr.
Rushworth
's
house
*NL*
became
Crawford
's
object
,
she
had
had
the
merit
of
withdrawing
herself
*NL*
from
it
,
and
of
chusing
that
time
to
pay
a
visit
to
her
other
friends
,
*NL*
in
order
to
secure
herself
from
being
again
too
much
attracted
.
This
had
*NL*
been
her
motive
in
going
to
her
cousin
's
.
Mr.
Yates
's
convenience
had
*NL*
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
.
She
had
been
allowing
his
attentions
some
*NL*
time
,
but
with
very
little
idea
of
ever
accepting
him
;
and
had
not
her
*NL*
sister
's
conduct
burst
forth
as
it
did
,
and
her
increased
dread
of
her
*NL*
father
and
of
home
,
on
that
event
,
imagining
its
certain
consequence
*NL*
to
herself
would
be
greater
severity
and
restraint
,
made
her
hastily
*NL*
resolve
on
avoiding
such
immediate
horrors
at
all
risks
,
it
is
probable
*NL*
that
Mr.
Yates
would
never
have
succeeded
.
She
had
not
eloped
with
any
*NL*
worse
feelings
than
those
of
selfish
alarm
.
It
had
appeared
to
her
the
*NL*
only
thing
to
be
done
.
Maria
's
guilt
had
induced
Julia
's
folly
.
*NL*
*NL*
Henry
Crawford
,
ruined
by
early
independence
and
bad
domestic
example
,
*NL*
indulged
in
the
freaks
of
a
cold-blooded
vanity
a
little
too
long
.
Once
*NL*
it
had
,
by
an
opening
undesigned
and
unmerited
,
led
him
into
the
way
of
*NL*
happiness
.
Could
he
have
been
satisfied
with
the
conquest
of
one
*NL*
amiable
woman
's
affections
,
could
he
have
found
sufficient
exultation
*NL*
in
overcoming
the
reluctance
,
in
working
himself
into
the
esteem
and
*NL*
tenderness
of
Fanny
Price
,
there
would
have
been
every
probability
of
*NL*
success
and
felicity
for
him
.
His
affection
had
already
done
something
.
*NL*
Her
influence
over
him
had
already
given
him
some
influence
over
her
.
*NL*
Would
he
have
deserved
more
,
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
more
would
have
*NL*
been
obtained
,
especially
when
that
marriage
had
taken
place
,
which
*NL*
would
have
given
him
the
assistance
of
her
conscience
in
subduing
her
*NL*
first
inclination
,
and
brought
them
very
often
together
.
Would
he
have
*NL*
persevered
,
and
uprightly
,
Fanny
must
have
been
his
reward
,
and
a
reward
*NL*
very
voluntarily
bestowed
,
within
a
reasonable
period
from
Edmund
's
*NL*
marrying
Mary
.
*NL*
*NL*
Had
he
done
as
he
intended
,
and
as
he
knew
he
ought
,
by
going
down
to
*NL*
Everingham
after
his
return
from
Portsmouth
,
he
might
have
been
deciding
*NL*
his
own
happy
destiny
.
But
he
was
pressed
to
stay
for
Mrs.
Fraser
's
*NL*
party
;
his
staying
was
made
of
flattering
consequence
,
and
he
was
to
*NL*
meet
Mrs.
Rushworth
there
.
Curiosity
and
vanity
were
both
engaged
,
and
*NL*
the
temptation
of
immediate
pleasure
was
too
strong
for
a
mind
unused
to
*NL*
make
any
sacrifice
to
right
:
he
resolved
to
defer
his
Norfolk
journey
,
*NL*
resolved
that
writing
should
answer
the
purpose
of
it
,
or
that
its
*NL*
purpose
was
unimportant
,
and
staid
.
He
saw
Mrs.
Rushworth
,
was
received
*NL*
by
her
with
a
coldness
which
ought
to
have
been
repulsive
,
and
have
*NL*
established
apparent
indifference
between
them
for
ever
;
but
he
was
*NL*
mortified
,
he
could
not
bear
to
be
thrown
off
by
the
woman
whose
smiles
*NL*
had
been
so
wholly
at
his
command
:
he
must
exert
himself
to
subdue
so
*NL*
proud
a
display
of
resentment
;
it
was
anger
on
Fanny
's
account
;
he
must
*NL*
get
the
better
of
it
,
and
make
Mrs.
Rushworth
Maria
Bertram
again
in
her
*NL*
treatment
of
himself
.
*NL*
*NL*
In
this
spirit
he
began
the
attack
,
and
by
animated
perseverance
had
*NL*
soon
re-established
the
sort
of
familiar
intercourse
,
of
gallantry
,
*NL*
of
flirtation
,
which
bounded
his
views
;
but
in
triumphing
over
the
*NL*
discretion
which
,
though
beginning
in
anger
,
might
have
saved
them
both
,
*NL*
he
had
put
himself
in
the
power
of
feelings
on
her
side
more
strong
*NL*
than
he
had
supposed
.
She
loved
him
;
there
was
no
withdrawing
attentions
*NL*
avowedly
dear
to
her
.
He
was
entangled
by
his
own
vanity
,
with
as
little
*NL*
excuse
of
love
as
possible
,
and
without
the
smallest
inconstancy
of
mind
*NL*
towards
her
cousin
.
To
keep
Fanny
and
the
Bertrams
from
a
knowledge
of
*NL*
what
was
passing
became
his
first
object
.
Secrecy
could
not
have
been
*NL*
more
desirable
for
Mrs.
Rushworth
's
credit
than
he
felt
it
for
his
own
.
*NL*
When
he
returned
from
Richmond
,
he
would
have
been
glad
to
see
Mrs.
*NL*
Rushworth
no
more
.
All
that
followed
was
the
result
of
her
imprudence
;
*NL*
and
he
went
off
with
her
at
last
,
because
he
could
not
help
it
,
*NL*
regretting
Fanny
even
at
the
moment
,
but
regretting
her
infinitely
more
*NL*
when
all
the
bustle
of
the
intrigue
was
over
,
and
a
very
few
months
had
*NL*
taught
him
,
by
the
force
of
contrast
,
to
place
a
yet
higher
value
on
the
*NL*
sweetness
of
her
temper
,
the
purity
of
her
mind
,
and
the
excellence
of
*NL*
her
principles
.
*NL*
*NL*
That
punishment
,
the
public
punishment
of
disgrace
,
should
in
a
just
*NL*
measure
attend
_
his
_
share
of
the
offence
is
,
we
know
,
not
one
of
the
*NL*
barriers
which
society
gives
to
virtue
.
In
this
world
the
penalty
is
*NL*
less
equal
than
could
be
wished
;
but
without
presuming
to
look
forward
*NL*
to
a
juster
appointment
hereafter
,
we
may
fairly
consider
a
man
of
*NL*
sense
,
like
Henry
Crawford
,
to
be
providing
for
himself
no
small
*NL*
portion
of
vexation
and
regret
:
vexation
that
must
rise
sometimes
*NL*
to
self-reproach
,
and
regret
to
wretchedness
,
in
having
so
requited
*NL*
hospitality
,
so
injured
family
peace
,
so
forfeited
his
best
,
most
*NL*
estimable
,
and
endeared
acquaintance
,
and
so
lost
the
woman
whom
he
had
*NL*
rationally
as
well
as
passionately
loved
.
*NL*
*NL*
After
what
had
passed
to
wound
and
alienate
the
two
families
,
the
*NL*
continuance
of
the
Bertrams
and
Grants
in
such
close
neighbourhood
would
*NL*
have
been
most
distressing
;
but
the
absence
of
the
latter
,
for
some
*NL*
months
purposely
lengthened
,
ended
very
fortunately
in
the
necessity
,
or
*NL*
at
least
the
practicability
,
of
a
permanent
removal
.
Dr.
Grant
,
through
*NL*
an
interest
on
which
he
had
almost
ceased
to
form
hopes
,
succeeded
to
*NL*
a
stall
in
Westminster
,
which
,
as
affording
an
occasion
for
leaving
*NL*
Mansfield
,
an
excuse
for
residence
in
London
,
and
an
increase
of
income
*NL*
to
answer
the
expenses
of
the
change
,
was
highly
acceptable
to
those
who
*NL*
went
and
those
who
staid
.
*NL*
*NL*
Mrs.
Grant
,
with
a
temper
to
love
and
be
loved
,
must
have
gone
with
some
*NL*
regret
from
the
scenes
and
people
she
had
been
used
to
;
but
the
same
*NL*
happiness
of
disposition
must
in
any
place
,
and
any
society
,
secure
her
*NL*
a
great
deal
to
enjoy
,
and
she
had
again
a
home
to
offer
Mary
;
and
Mary
*NL*
had
had
enough
of
her
own
friends
,
enough
of
vanity
,
ambition
,
love
,
and
*NL*
disappointment
in
the
course
of
the
last
half-year
,
to
be
in
need
of
the
*NL*
true
kindness
of
her
sister
's
heart
,
and
the
rational
tranquillity
*NL*
of
her
ways
.
They
lived
together
;
and
when
Dr.
Grant
had
brought
on
*NL*
apoplexy
and
death
,
by
three
great
institutionary
dinners
in
one
week
,
*NL*
they
still
lived
together
;
for
Mary
,
though
perfectly
resolved
against
*NL*
ever
attaching
herself
to
a
younger
brother
again
,
was
long
in
finding
*NL*
among
the
dashing
representatives
,
or
idle
heir-apparents
,
who
were
at
*NL*
the
command
of
her
beauty
,
and
her
#
20,000
,
any
one
who
could
satisfy
the
*NL*
better
taste
she
had
acquired
at
Mansfield
,
whose
character
and
manners
*NL*
could
authorise
a
hope
of
the
domestic
happiness
she
had
there
learned
*NL*
to
estimate
,
or
put
Edmund
Bertram
sufficiently
out
of
her
head
.
*NL*
*NL*
Edmund
had
greatly
the
advantage
of
her
in
this
respect
.
He
had
not
to
*NL*
wait
and
wish
with
vacant
affections
for
an
object
worthy
to
succeed
her
*NL*
in
them
.
Scarcely
had
he
done
regretting
Mary
Crawford
,
and
observing
to
*NL*
Fanny
how
impossible
it
was
that
he
should
ever
meet
with
such
another
*NL*
woman
,
before
it
began
to
strike
him
whether
a
very
different
kind
of
*NL*
woman
might
not
do
just
as
well
,
or
a
great
deal
better
:
whether
Fanny
*NL*
herself
were
not
growing
as
dear
,
as
important
to
him
in
all
her
smiles
*NL*
and
all
her
ways
,
as
Mary
Crawford
had
ever
been
;
and
whether
it
might
*NL*
not
be
a
possible
,
an
hopeful
undertaking
to
persuade
her
that
her
warm
*NL*
and
sisterly
regard
for
him
would
be
foundation
enough
for
wedded
love
.
*NL*
*NL*
I
purposely
abstain
from
dates
on
this
occasion
,
that
every
one
may
*NL*
be
at
liberty
to
fix
their
own
,
aware
that
the
cure
of
unconquerable
*NL*
passions
,
and
the
transfer
of
unchanging
attachments
,
must
vary
much
as
*NL*
to
time
in
different
people
.
I
only
entreat
everybody
to
believe
that
*NL*
exactly
at
the
time
when
it
was
quite
natural
that
it
should
be
so
,
and
*NL*
not
a
week
earlier
,
Edmund
did
cease
to
care
about
Miss
Crawford
,
and
*NL*
became
as
anxious
to
marry
Fanny
as
Fanny
herself
could
desire
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
such
a
regard
for
her
,
indeed
,
as
his
had
long
been
,
a
regard
*NL*
founded
on
the
most
endearing
claims
of
innocence
and
helplessness
,
and
*NL*
completed
by
every
recommendation
of
growing
worth
,
what
could
be
more
*NL*
natural
than
the
change
?
Loving
,
guiding
,
protecting
her
,
as
he
had
been
*NL*
doing
ever
since
her
being
ten
years
old
,
her
mind
in
so
great
a
degree
*NL*
formed
by
his
care
,
and
her
comfort
depending
on
his
kindness
,
an
*NL*
object
to
him
of
such
close
and
peculiar
interest
,
dearer
by
all
his
own
*NL*
importance
with
her
than
any
one
else
at
Mansfield
,
what
was
there
now
*NL*
to
add
,
but
that
he
should
learn
to
prefer
soft
light
eyes
to
sparkling
*NL*
dark
ones
.
And
being
always
with
her
,
and
always
talking
confidentially
,
*NL*
and
his
feelings
exactly
in
that
favourable
state
which
a
recent
*NL*
disappointment
gives
,
those
soft
light
eyes
could
not
be
very
long
in
*NL*
obtaining
the
pre-eminence
.
*NL*
*NL*
Having
once
set
out
,
and
felt
that
he
had
done
so
on
this
road
to
*NL*
happiness
,
there
was
nothing
on
the
side
of
prudence
to
stop
him
or
make
*NL*
his
progress
slow
;
no
doubts
of
her
deserving
,
no
fears
of
opposition
of
*NL*
taste
,
no
need
of
drawing
new
hopes
of
happiness
from
dissimilarity
*NL*
of
temper
.
Her
mind
,
disposition
,
opinions
,
and
habits
wanted
no
*NL*
half-concealment
,
no
self-deception
on
the
present
,
no
reliance
on
*NL*
future
improvement
.
Even
in
the
midst
of
his
late
infatuation
,
he
had
*NL*
acknowledged
Fanny
's
mental
superiority
.
What
must
be
his
sense
of
it
*NL*
now
,
therefore
?
She
was
of
course
only
too
good
for
him
;
but
as
nobody
*NL*
minds
having
what
is
too
good
for
them
,
he
was
very
steadily
earnest
in
*NL*
the
pursuit
of
the
blessing
,
and
it
was
not
possible
that
encouragement
*NL*
from
her
should
be
long
wanting
.
Timid
,
anxious
,
doubting
as
she
was
,
it
*NL*
was
still
impossible
that
such
tenderness
as
hers
should
not
,
at
times
,
*NL*
hold
out
the
strongest
hope
of
success
,
though
it
remained
for
a
later
*NL*
period
to
tell
him
the
whole
delightful
and
astonishing
truth
.
His
*NL*
happiness
in
knowing
himself
to
have
been
so
long
the
beloved
of
such
a
*NL*
heart
,
must
have
been
great
enough
to
warrant
any
strength
of
language
*NL*
in
which
he
could
clothe
it
to
her
or
to
himself
;
it
must
have
been
*NL*
a
delightful
happiness
.
But
there
was
happiness
elsewhere
which
no
*NL*
description
can
reach
.
Let
no
one
presume
to
give
the
feelings
of
a
*NL*
young
woman
on
receiving
the
assurance
of
that
affection
of
which
she
*NL*
has
scarcely
allowed
herself
to
entertain
a
hope
.
*NL*
*NL*
Their
own
inclinations
ascertained
,
there
were
no
difficulties
behind
,
*NL*
no
drawback
of
poverty
or
parent
.
It
was
a
match
which
Sir
Thomas
's
*NL*
wishes
had
even
forestalled
.
Sick
of
ambitious
and
mercenary
connexions
,
*NL*
prizing
more
and
more
the
sterling
good
of
principle
and
temper
,
and
*NL*
chiefly
anxious
to
bind
by
the
strongest
securities
all
that
remained
to
*NL*
him
of
domestic
felicity
,
he
had
pondered
with
genuine
satisfaction
on
*NL*
the
more
than
possibility
of
the
two
young
friends
finding
their
natural
*NL*
consolation
in
each
other
for
all
that
had
occurred
of
disappointment
to
*NL*
either
;
and
the
joyful
consent
which
met
Edmund
's
application
,
the
high
*NL*
sense
of
having
realised
a
great
acquisition
in
the
promise
of
Fanny
for
*NL*
a
daughter
,
formed
just
such
a
contrast
with
his
early
opinion
on
the
*NL*
subject
when
the
poor
little
girl
's
coming
had
been
first
agitated
,
as
*NL*
time
is
for
ever
producing
between
the
plans
and
decisions
of
mortals
,
*NL*
for
their
own
instruction
,
and
their
neighbours
'
entertainment
.
*NL*
*NL*
Fanny
was
indeed
the
daughter
that
he
wanted
.
His
charitable
kindness
*NL*
had
been
rearing
a
prime
comfort
for
himself
.
His
liberality
had
a
rich
*NL*
repayment
,
and
the
general
goodness
of
his
intentions
by
her
deserved
*NL*
it
.
He
might
have
made
her
childhood
happier
;
but
it
had
been
an
error
*NL*
of
judgment
only
which
had
given
him
the
appearance
of
harshness
,
and
*NL*
deprived
him
of
her
early
love
;
and
now
,
on
really
knowing
each
other
,
*NL*
their
mutual
attachment
became
very
strong
.
After
settling
her
at
*NL*
Thornton
Lacey
with
every
kind
attention
to
her
comfort
,
the
object
of
*NL*
almost
every
day
was
to
see
her
there
,
or
to
get
her
away
from
it
.
*NL*
*NL*
Selfishly
dear
as
she
had
long
been
to
Lady
Bertram
,
she
could
not
be
*NL*
parted
with
willingly
by
_
her
_
.
No
happiness
of
son
or
niece
could
make
*NL*
her
wish
the
marriage
.
But
it
was
possible
to
part
with
her
,
because
*NL*
Susan
remained
to
supply
her
place
.
Susan
became
the
stationary
niece
,
*NL*
delighted
to
be
so
;
and
equally
well
adapted
for
it
by
a
readiness
of
*NL*
mind
,
and
an
inclination
for
usefulness
,
as
Fanny
had
been
by
sweetness
*NL*
of
temper
,
and
strong
feelings
of
gratitude
.
Susan
could
never
be
*NL*
spared
.
First
as
a
comfort
to
Fanny
,
then
as
an
auxiliary
,
and
last
as
*NL*
her
substitute
,
she
was
established
at
Mansfield
,
with
every
appearance
*NL*
of
equal
permanency
.
Her
more
fearless
disposition
and
happier
nerves
*NL*
made
everything
easy
to
her
there
.
With
quickness
in
understanding
*NL*
the
tempers
of
those
she
had
to
deal
with
,
and
no
natural
timidity
to
*NL*
restrain
any
consequent
wishes
,
she
was
soon
welcome
and
useful
to
all
;
*NL*
and
after
Fanny
's
removal
succeeded
so
naturally
to
her
influence
over
*NL*
the
hourly
comfort
of
her
aunt
,
as
gradually
to
become
,
perhaps
,
the
*NL*
most
beloved
of
the
two
.
In
_
her
_
usefulness
,
in
Fanny
's
excellence
,
*NL*
in
William
's
continued
good
conduct
and
rising
fame
,
and
in
the
general
*NL*
well-doing
and
success
of
the
other
members
of
the
family
,
all
assisting
*NL*
to
advance
each
other
,
and
doing
credit
to
his
countenance
and
aid
,
Sir
*NL*
Thomas
saw
repeated
,
and
for
ever
repeated
,
reason
to
rejoice
in
what
he
*NL*
had
done
for
them
all
,
and
acknowledge
the
advantages
of
early
hardship
*NL*
and
discipline
,
and
the
consciousness
of
being
born
to
struggle
and
*NL*
endure
.
*NL*
*NL*
With
so
much
true
merit
and
true
love
,
and
no
want
of
fortune
and
*NL*
friends
,
the
happiness
of
the
married
cousins
must
appear
as
secure
as
*NL*
earthly
happiness
can
be
.
Equally
formed
for
domestic
life
,
and
attached
*NL*
to
country
pleasures
,
their
home
was
the
home
of
affection
and
comfort
;
*NL*
and
to
complete
the
picture
of
good
,
the
acquisition
of
Mansfield
*NL*
living
,
by
the
death
of
Dr.
Grant
,
occurred
just
after
they
had
been
*NL*
married
long
enough
to
begin
to
want
an
increase
of
income
,
and
feel
*NL*
their
distance
from
the
paternal
abode
an
inconvenience
.
*NL*
*NL*
On
that
event
they
removed
to
Mansfield
;
and
the
Parsonage
there
,
*NL*
which
,
under
each
of
its
two
former
owners
,
Fanny
had
never
been
able
*NL*
to
approach
but
with
some
painful
sensation
of
restraint
or
alarm
,
soon
*NL*
grew
as
dear
to
her
heart
,
and
as
thoroughly
perfect
in
her
eyes
,
as
*NL*
everything
else
within
the
view
and
patronage
of
Mansfield
Park
had
long
*NL*
been
.

END
